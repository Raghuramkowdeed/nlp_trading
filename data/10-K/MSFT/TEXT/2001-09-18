ACCENTURE LTD, WHICH OFFERS SOLUTIONS AND SERVICES BASED ON WINDOWS 2000.

PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT

THE SOFTWARE INDUSTRY IS CHARACTERIZED BY RAPID TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE, WHICH

REQUIRES CONSTANT ATTENTION TO COMPUTING TECHNOLOGY TRENDS, AND SHIFTING

CONSUMER DEMAND, AND RAPID PRODUCT INNOVATION.  THE PACE OF CHANGE IS

ACCELERATING AS THE COMPUTING NEEDS OF OUR CUSTOMERS MOVE BEYOND THE PC TOWARD

INTELLIGENT DEVICES AND APPLIANCES.

MOST OF THE COMPANY'S SOFTWARE PRODUCTS ARE DEVELOPED INTERNALLY.  THE COMPANY

ALSO PURCHASES TECHNOLOGY, LICENSES INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS, AND OVERSEES

THIRD-PARTY DEVELOPMENT AND LOCALIZATION OF CERTAIN PRODUCTS.  INTERNAL

DEVELOPMENT ENABLES MICROSOFT TO MAINTAIN CLOSER TECHNICAL CONTROL OVER ITS

PRODUCTS AND GIVES THE COMPANY THE FREEDOM TO DESIGNATE WHICH MODIFICATIONS AND

ENHANCEMENTS ARE MOST IMPORTANT AND WHEN THEY SHOULD BE IMPLEMENTED.  THE

COMPANY HAS CREATED A SUBSTANTIAL BODY OF PROPRIETARY DEVELOPMENT TOOLS AND HAS

EVOLVED DEVELOPMENT METHODOLOGIES FOR CREATING AND ENHANCING ITS PRODUCTS.

THESE TOOLS AND METHODOLOGIES ARE ALSO DESIGNED TO SIMPLIFY A PRODUCT'S

PORTABILITY AMONG DIFFERENT OPERATING SYSTEMS, MICROPROCESSORS, OR COMPUTING

DEVICES.  PRODUCT DOCUMENTATION IS GENERALLY CREATED INTERNALLY.

THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT A CRUCIAL FACTOR IN THE SUCCESS OF A NEW PRODUCT IS

GETTING IT TO MARKET QUICKLY TO RESPOND TO NEW USER NEEDS OR ADVANCES IN

INTELLIGENT DEVICES, PCS, SERVERS, AND THE INTERNET, WITHOUT COMPROMISING

PRODUCT QUALITY.  THE COMPANY STRIVES TO BECOME INFORMED AT THE EARLIEST

POSSIBLE TIME ABOUT CHANGING USAGE PATTERNS AND HARDWARE ADVANCES THAT MAY

AFFECT SOFTWARE DESIGN.  BEFORE RELEASING NEW SOFTWARE PLATFORMS, MICROSOFT

PROVIDES TO SOFTWARE VENDORS A RANGE OF DEVELOPMENT, TRAINING, TESTING

RESOURCES, AND GUIDELINES FOR DEVELOPING APPLICATIONS.

TO BEST SERVE THE NEEDS OF USERS AROUND THE WORLD, MICROSOFT "LOCALIZES" MANY OF

ITS PRODUCTS TO REFLECT LOCAL LANGUAGES AND CONVENTIONS AND TO IMPROVE THE

QUALITY AND USABILITY OF THE PRODUCT IN INTERNATIONAL MARKETS.  LOCALIZING A

PRODUCT MIGHT REQUIRE MODIFYING THE USER INTERFACE, ALTERING DIALOG BOXES, AND

TRANSLATING TEXT.  IN JAPANESE VERSIONS, FOR EXAMPLE, ALL USER MESSAGES AND

DOCUMENTATION ARE IN JAPANESE WITH MONETARY REFERENCES IN THE JAPANESE YEN.

VARIOUS MICROSOFT PRODUCTS HAVE BEEN LOCALIZED INTO MORE THAN 30 LANGUAGES.

DURING FISCAL YEARS 1999, 2000, AND 2001, THE COMPANY SPENT $2.97 BILLION, $3.77

BILLION, AND $4.38 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY, ON PRODUCT RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

ACTIVITIES EXCLUDING FUNDING OF JOINT VENTURE ACTIVITY.  THOSE AMOUNTS

REPRESENTED 15.0%, 16.4%, AND 17.3%, RESPECTIVELY, OF REVENUE IN EACH OF THOSE

YEARS.  THE COMPANY IS COMMITTED TO CONTINUE HIGH EXPENDITURES FOR RESEARCH AND

PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT.

MICROSOFT .NET IS MICROSOFT'S PLATFORM FOR XML WEB SERVICES.  XML WEB SERVICES

ALLOW APPLICATIONS TO COMMUNICATE AND SHARE DATA OVER THE INTERNET, REGARDLESS

OF OPERATING SYSTEM OR PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE.  THE MICROSOFT .NET PLATFORM

INCLUDES A COMPREHENSIVE FAMILY OF PRODUCTS, BUILT ON XML AND INTERNET INDUSTRY

STANDARDS, WHICH PROVIDE FOR EACH ASPECT OF DEVELOPING, MANAGING, USING, AND

EXPERIENCING XML WEB SERVICES.  THERE ARE FIVE AREAS WHERE MICROSOFT IS BUILDING

THE .NET PLATFORM TODAY:  TOOLS, SERVERS, XML WEB SERVICES, CLIENTS, AND .NET

EXPERIENCES.  IN THE TOOLS AREA, VISUAL STUDIO .NET AND THE

7

MICROSOFT .NET FRAMEWORK SUPPLY A COMPLETE SOLUTION FOR DEVELOPERS TO BUILD,

DEPLOY, AND RUN XML WEB SERVICES. THEY MAXIMIZE THE PERFORMANCE, RELIABILITY,

AND SECURITY OF XML WEB SERVICES. THE .NET ENTERPRISE SERVERS, INCLUDING THE

WINDOWS 2000 SERVER FAMILY, MAKE UP MICROSOFT .NET'S SERVER INFRASTRUCTURE FOR

DEPLOYING, MANAGING, AND ORCHESTRATING XML WEB SERVICES. DESIGNED WITH MISSION-

CRITICAL PERFORMANCE IN MIND, THEY PROVIDE ENTERPRISES WITH THE AGILITY THEY

NEED TO INTEGRATE THEIR SYSTEMS, APPLICATIONS, AND PARTNERS THROUGH XML WEB

SERVICES, AND THE FLEXIBILITY TO ADAPT TO CHANGING BUSINESS REQUIREMENTS.

IN ADDITION TO DEVELOPERS CREATING XML WEB SERVICES, MICROSOFT IS CREATING A

CORE SET OF BUILDING BLOCK SERVICES THAT PERFORM ROUTINE TASKS AND ACT AS THE

BACKBONE FOR DEVELOPERS TO BUILD UPON.  THE FIRST SET OF XML WEB SERVICES BEING

BUILT, CODENAMED "HAILSTORM", IS A GROUP OF USER-CENTRIC SERVICES ORIENTED

AROUND PEOPLE, RATHER THAN SPECIFIC DEVICES, NETWORKS, OR APPLICATIONS.

HAILSTORM IS BASED UPON THE MICROSOFT PASSPORT USER AUTHENTICATION SYSTEM.  WITH

HAILSTORM, USERS RECEIVE RELEVANT INFORMATION, AS THEY NEED IT, DELIVERED TO THE

DEVICES THEY ARE USING, AND BASED ON PREFERENCES THEY HAVE ESTABLISHED.

CLIENTS ARE PCS, LAPTOPS, WORKSTATIONS, PHONES, HANDHELD COMPUTERS, TABLET PCS,

GAME CONSOLES, AND OTHER SMART DEVICES.  THESE SMART CLIENTS AND DEVICES USE

SOFTWARE THAT SUPPORTS XML WEB SERVICES, WHICH ENABLE USERS TO ACCESS THEIR DATA

REGARDLESS OF THE LOCATION, TYPE, AND NUMBER OF CLIENTS USED.  SMART CLIENTS AND

DEVICES LEVERAGE XML WEB SERVICES TO CREATE .NET EXPERIENCES THAT ALLOW USERS TO

ACCESS INFORMATION ACROSS THE INTERNET AND FROM STAND-ALONE APPLICATIONS IN AN

INTEGRATED WAY.  SOME OF THE PRODUCTS THAT MICROSOFT IS TRANSITIONING INTO .NET

EXPERIENCES ARE OFFICE, MSN, BCENTRAL, AND VISUAL STUDIO .NET.

MANUFACTURING

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

MICROSOFT CONTRACTS OUT MOST OF ITS MANUFACTURING ACTIVITY TO THIRD PARTIES.

OUTSIDE MANUFACTURERS PRODUCE VARIOUS RETAIL SOFTWARE PACKAGED PRODUCTS AND

HARDWARE.  THERE ARE OTHER CUSTOM MANUFACTURERS MICROSOFT COULD USE IN THE EVENT

OUTSOURCED MANUFACTURING BECOMES UNAVAILABLE FROM CURRENT VENDORS.

THE COMPANY'S CD-ROM MANUFACTURING FACILITIES ARE LOCATED IN PUERTO RICO.  THE

COMPANY HAS MULTIPLE SOURCES FOR RAW MATERIALS, SUPPLIES, AND COMPONENTS AND IS

OFTEN ABLE TO ACQUIRE COMPONENT PARTS AND MATERIALS ON A VOLUME DISCOUNT BASIS.

QUALITY CONTROL TESTS ARE PERFORMED ON PURCHASED PARTS, CD-ROMS, AND OTHER

PRODUCTS.

EXPERIENCE RANGING FROM NETWORKING, E-COMMERCE, COLLABORATION, BUSINESS

INTELLIGENCE, AND OTHER LEADING EDGE DISCIPLINES.

INTERNATIONAL SALES SITES.  THE COMPANY HAS ESTABLISHED MARKETING AND/OR SUPPORT

SUBSIDIARIES IN MORE THAN 80 COUNTRIES.  PRODUCT IS GENERALLY DELIVERED BY THE

COMPANY'S OWNED OR OUTSOURCED MANUFACTURING OPERATIONS, WHICH ARE LOCATED IN THE

GEOGRAPHICAL REGION IN WHICH THE PRODUCT WAS SOLD.  BY ORGANIZING

GEOGRAPHICALLY, THE COMPANY IS ABLE TO PROVIDE SERVICE TO INTERNATIONAL CHANNEL

CUSTOMERS AND ACCESS TO MICROSOFT PROFESSIONALS LOCATED IN THE SAME REGION TO

SERVE THEIR SPECIFIC NEEDS.  SUBSIDIARIES HAVE THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR SELLING

PRODUCTS TO CUSTOMERS, MANAGING LICENSING PROGRAMS, AND PROVIDING SUPPORT TO ALL

TYPES OF CUSTOMERS BASED IN INTERNATIONAL COUNTRIES.

THE COMPANY'S INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS, BOTH OEM AND FINISHED GOODS, ARE SUBJECT

TO CERTAIN RISKS COMMON TO FOREIGN OPERATIONS IN GENERAL, SUCH AS GOVERNMENTAL

REGULATIONS, IMPORT RESTRICTIONS, AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATE FLUCTUATIONS.

MICROSOFT HEDGES A PORTION OF ITS FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK.

OEM CHANNEL

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

MICROSOFT OPERATING SYSTEMS ARE LICENSED PRIMARILY TO OEMS UNDER AGREEMENTS THAT

GRANT THE OEMS THE RIGHT TO DISTRIBUTE COPIES OF THE COMPANY'S PRODUCTS WITH

THEIR COMPUTING DEVICES, PRINCIPALLY PCS.  THE COMPANY ALSO MARKETS AND LICENSES

CERTAIN SERVER OPERATING SYSTEMS, DESKTOP APPLICATIONS, HARDWARE DEVICES, AND

CONSUMER SOFTWARE PROGRAMS TO OEMS UNDER SIMILAR ARRANGEMENTS.  IN ALMOST ALL

CASES, THE PRODUCTS ARE DISTRIBUTED UNDER MICROSOFT TRADEMARKS.  THE COMPANY HAS

OEM AGREEMENTS COVERING ONE OR MORE OF ITS PRODUCTS WITH VIRTUALLY ALL OF THE

9

CUSTOMERS

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

THE COMPANY'S CUSTOMERS INCLUDE CONSUMERS, SMALL- AND MEDIUM-SIZED

ORGANIZATIONS, ENTERPRISES, EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS, ISPS, APPLICATION

DEVELOPERS, AND OEMS.  MOST CONSUMERS OF MICROSOFT PRODUCTS ARE INDIVIDUALS IN

BUSINESSES, GOVERNMENT AGENCIES, EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS, AND AT HOME.  THE

CONSUMERS AND ORGANIZATIONS OBTAIN MICROSOFT PRODUCTS PRIMARILY THROUGH

RESELLERS AND OEMS, WHICH INCLUDE CERTAIN MICROSOFT PRODUCTS WITH THEIR

COMPUTING HARDWARE.  THE NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (SEE ITEM 8) QUANTIFY

CUSTOMERS THAT REPRESENT MORE THAN 10% OF THE COMPANY'S REVENUE.  THE COMPANY'S

PRACTICE IS TO SHIP ITS PRODUCTS PROMPTLY UPON RECEIPT OF PURCHASE ORDERS FROM

ITS CUSTOMERS AND, CONSEQUENTLY, BACKLOG IS NOT SIGNIFICANT.

COMPETITION

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

THE SOFTWARE BUSINESS IS INTENSELY COMPETITIVE AND SUBJECT TO RAPID

TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE.  AS THE COMPANY PURSUES ITS LARGEST STRATEGIC INITIATIVE,

MICROSOFT .NET, THE COMPANY COULD EXPERIENCE MORE INTENSE COMPETITION DURING THE

TRANSITION FROM THE TRADITIONAL CORE BUSINESSES TO ITS NEW PRODUCTS BASED ON THE

.NET PLATFORM.  THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO FACE MOVEMENTS FROM PC-BASED

APPLICATIONS TO SERVER-BASED APPLICATIONS OR WEB-BASED APPLICATION HOSTING

SERVICES, FROM PROPRIETARY SOFTWARE TO OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE, AND FROM PCS TO

INTERNET-BASED DEVICES.  A NUMBER OF MICROSOFT'S MOST SIGNIFICANT COMPETITORS,

INCLUDING IBM, SUN MICROSYSTEMS, ORACLE, AND AOL TIME WARNER, ARE COLLABORATING

WITH ONE ANOTHER ON VARIOUS INITIATIVES DIRECTED AT COMPETING WITH MICROSOFT.

THESE INITIATIVES RELATE IN PART TO EFFORTS TO MOVE SOFTWARE FROM INDIVIDUAL PCS

TO CENTRALLY MANAGED SERVERS, WHICH WOULD PRESENT SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES TO THE

COMPANY'S HISTORICAL BUSINESS MODEL.  OTHER COMPETITIVE COLLABORATIVE EFFORTS

INCLUDE THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW PLATFORM TECHNOLOGIES THAT ARE INTENDED TO

REPLICATE MUCH OF THE VALUE OF MICROSOFT WINDOWS OPERATING SYSTEMS.  NEW

COMPUTING FORM FACTORS, INCLUDING NON-PC INFORMATION DEVICES, ARE GAINING

POPULARITY AND COMPETING WITH PCS RUNNING MICROSOFT'S SOFTWARE PRODUCTS.

MICROSOFT FACES FORMIDABLE COMPETITION IN THESE NEW AREAS AND IN ALL AREAS OF

ITS CURRENT BUSINESS ACTIVITY, INCLUDING COMPETITION FROM MANY COMPANIES MUCH

LARGER THAN MICROSOFT.  THE RAPID PACE OF TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE, PARTICULARLY IN

THE AREA OF INTERNET PLATFORMS AND SERVICES, CONTINUALLY CREATES NEW

OPPORTUNITIES FOR EXISTING COMPETITORS AND START-UPS AND CAN QUICKLY RENDER

EXISTING TECHNOLOGIES LESS VALUABLE.  THE COMPANY ALSO FACES RELENTLESS

COMPETITION FROM SOFTWARE PIRATES WHO UNLAWFULLY COPY AND DISTRIBUTE MICROSOFT'S

COPYRIGHTED SOFTWARE PRODUCTS, DEPRIVING THE COMPANY OF LARGE AMOUNTS OF REVENUE

ON AN ANNUAL BASIS.

THE COMPANY'S COMPETITIVE POSITION MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY ONE OR MORE OF

THE FOLLOWING FACTORS IN THE FUTURE, PARTICULARLY IN VIEW OF THE FAST PACE OF

TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE IN THE COMPUTING INDUSTRY.

DESKTOP AND ENTERPRISE SOFTWARE AND SERVICES

--------------------------------------------

THE COMPANY'S COMPETITORS INCLUDE MANY SOFTWARE APPLICATION VENDORS, SUCH AS IBM

(LOTUS), ORACLE, APPLE (FILEMAKER, INC.), SUN MICROSYSTEMS, COREL, QUALCOMM, AND

LOCAL APPLICATION DEVELOPERS IN EUROPE AND ASIA.  IBM AND COREL HAVE LARGE

INSTALLED BASES WITH THEIR SPREADSHEET AND WORD PROCESSOR PRODUCTS,

RESPECTIVELY, AND BOTH HAVE AGGRESSIVE PRICING STRATEGIES.  ALSO, IBM AND APPLE

PREINSTALL CERTAIN OF THEIR APPLICATION SOFTWARE PRODUCTS ON VARIOUS MODELS OF

THEIR PCS, COMPETING DIRECTLY WITH MICROSOFT'S DESKTOP APPLICATION SOFTWARE.

SUN MICROSYSTEMS' STAR OFFICE IS ALSO VERY AGGRESSIVE WITH ITS PRICING, OFFERING

A FREE DOWNLOAD FROM THE WEB OR NOMINAL CHARGE FOR A CD.  ADDITIONALLY, WEB-

BASED APPLICATION HOSTING SERVICES PROVIDE AN ALTERNATIVE TO PC-BASED

APPLICATIONS SUCH AS MICROSOFT OFFICE.

MICROSOFT'S OPERATING SYSTEM PRODUCTS FACE SUBSTANTIAL COMPETITION FROM A WIDE

VARIETY OF COMPANIES.  COMPETITORS SUCH AS IBM, APPLE COMPUTER, SUN

MICROSYSTEMS, AND OTHERS ARE VERTICALLY INTEGRATED IN BOTH SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT

AND HARDWARE MANUFACTURING AND HAVE DEVELOPED OPERATING SYSTEMS THAT THEY

PREINSTALL ON THEIR OWN COMPUTERS.  MANY OF THESE OPERATING SYSTEM SOFTWARE

PRODUCTS ARE ALSO LICENSED TO THIRD-PARTY OEMS FOR PREINSTALLATION ON THEIR

COMPUTERS.  MICROSOFT'S OPERATING SYSTEM PRODUCTS COMPETE WITH UNIX-BASED

OPERATING SYSTEMS FROM A WIDE RANGE OF COMPANIES, INCLUDING IBM, HEWLETT-

PACKARD, SUN

10

MICROSYSTEMS, AND OTHERS. VARIANTS OF UNIX RUN ON A WIDE VARIETY OF COMPUTER

PLATFORMS AND HAVE GAINED INCREASING ACCEPTANCE AS DESKTOP OPERATING SYSTEMS.

WITH INCREASED ATTENTION TOWARD OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE, THE LINUX OPERATING SYSTEM

HAS GAINED INCREASING ACCEPTANCE AS WELL. SEVERAL COMPUTER MANUFACTURERS

PREINSTALL LINUX ON PC SERVERS AND MANY LEADING SOFTWARE DEVELOPERS HAVE WRITTEN

APPLICATIONS THAT RUN ON LINUX. MICROSOFT WINDOWS OPERATING SYSTEMS ARE ALSO

THREATENED BY ALTERNATIVE PLATFORMS SUCH AS THOSE BASED ON INTERNET BROWSING

SOFTWARE AND JAVA TECHNOLOGY PROMOTED BY AOL TIME WARNER AND SUN MICROSYSTEMS.

THE COMPANY COMPETES IN THE BUSINESS OF PROVIDING ENTERPRISE-WIDE COMPUTING

SOLUTIONS WITH SEVERAL COMPETITORS WHO ENJOY A LARGER SHARE OF SALES AND LARGER

INSTALLED BASES.  MANY COMPANIES OFFER OPERATING SYSTEM SOFTWARE FOR MAINFRAMES

AND MIDRANGE COMPUTERS, INCLUDING IBM, HEWLETT-PACKARD, AND SUN MICROSYSTEMS.

SINCE LEGACY BUSINESS SYSTEMS ARE TYPICALLY SUPPORT-INTENSIVE, THESE COMPETITORS

ALSO OFFER SUBSTANTIAL SUPPORT SERVICES.  SOFTWARE DEVELOPERS THAT PROVIDE

COMPETING SERVER APPLICATIONS FOR PC-BASED DISTRIBUTED CLIENT/SERVER

ENVIRONMENTS INCLUDE ORACLE, IBM, COMPUTER ASSOCIATES, SYBASE, AND INFORMIX.

THERE ARE ALSO SEVERAL SOFTWARE VENDORS WHO OFFER CONNECTIVITY SERVERS.  AS

MENTIONED ABOVE, THERE ARE NUMEROUS COMPANIES AND ORGANIZATIONS THAT OFFER

INTERNET AND INTRANET SERVER SOFTWARE, WHICH COMPETE AGAINST THE COMPANY'S

BUSINESS SYSTEMS.  ADDITIONALLY, IBM HAS A LARGE INSTALLED BASE OF LOTUS NOTES

AND CC:MAIL, BOTH OF WHICH COMPETE WITH THE COMPANY'S COLLABORATION AND E-MAIL

PRODUCTS.

THE COMPANY'S DEVELOPER PRODUCTS COMPETE AGAINST OFFERINGS FROM BORLAND,

MACROMEDIA, ORACLE, SUN MICROSYSTEMS, SYBASE, SYMANTEC, AND OTHER COMPANIES.

CONSUMER SOFTWARE, SERVICES, AND DEVICES

----------------------------------------

MICROSOFT'S ONLINE SERVICES NETWORK, MSN, FACES FORMIDABLE COMPETITION FROM AOL

TIME WARNER (INCLUDING ITS COMPUSERVE UNIT), YAHOO!, AND A VAST ARRAY OF WEB

SITES AND PORTALS THAT OFFER CONTENT OF ALL TYPES AND E-MAIL, INSTANT MESSAGING,

CALENDARING, CHAT, AND SEARCH AND SHOPPING SERVICES, AMONG OTHER THINGS.  IN

ADDITION, THE EASE OF ENTRY INTO INTERNET SERVICES HAS ALLOWED NUMEROUS WEB-

BASED SERVICE COMPANIES TO BUILD SIGNIFICANT BUSINESSES IN AREAS SUCH AS E-MAIL,

ELECTRONIC COMMERCE, WEB SEARCH ENGINES, DIRECTORIES, AND INFORMATION OF

NUMEROUS TYPES.  COMPETITORS INCLUDE AOL TIME WARNER, YAHOO!, EXCITE, LYCOS,

INFOSEEK, ALTAVISTA, AND MANY OTHERS.  THE COMPANY'S MSNBC JOINT VENTURES FACE

CONSIDERABLE COMPETITION FROM OTHER 24-HOUR CABLE AND INTERNET NEWS

ORGANIZATIONS SUCH AS CNN, CNN HEADLINE NEWS, AND FOX NEWS NETWORK.  MSNBC ALSO

COMPETES WITH TRADITIONAL NEWS MEDIA SUCH AS NEWSPAPERS, MAGAZINES, AND

BROADCAST TV.

THE COMPANY'S CONSUMER GROUP CONTINUES TO SEE CONSOLIDATION ACROSS THE VARIOUS

ENTERTAINMENT AND PRODUCTIVITY SEGMENTS IN WHICH MICROSOFT COMPETES.

COMPETITORS INCLUDE VIVENDI (HAVAS), INTUIT, ELECTRONIC ARTS, THE LEARNING

COMPANY, INFOGRAMMES, AND LOGITECH.  STILL OTHER COMPETITORS OWN BRANDED

CONTENT, SUCH AS DISNEY AND LUCASARTS.

ADDITIONALLY, PC-BASED GAMES AND THE COMPANY'S FUTURE XBOX COMPETE AND WILL

COMPETE HEAD-TO-HEAD AGAINST GAMES CREATED FOR PROPRIETARY SYSTEMS SUCH AS THE

NINTENDO GAMECUBE AND THE SONY PLAYSTATION.  GAME DEVELOPERS LIKE ELECTRONIC

ARTS, NAMCO, MIDWAY, ACTIVISION, KONAMI, THQ, TO NAME A FEW, ARE BOTH PARTNERS

AND COMPETITORS IN THE GAMES SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT SEGMENT.

MICROSOFT FACES MANY COMPETITORS IN THE MOBILE DEVICES SPACE, INCLUDING PALM,

SYMBIAN, NOKIA, AND OPENWAVE.  THE EMBEDDED OPERATING SYSTEM MARKET IS HIGHLY

FRAGMENTED WITH MANY COMPETITIVE OFFERINGS.  KEY COMPETITORS INCLUDE WIND RIVER

AND VERSIONS OF EMBEDDABLE LINUX FROM COMMERCIAL LINUX VENDORS SUCH AS RED HAT,

LINEO, AND MONTA VISTA.  THE LARGEST COMPETITOR REMAINS IN-HOUSE OPERATING

SYSTEMS DEVELOPED BY DEVICE MANUFACTURERS.  HOWEVER, THIS IS CHANGING AS MORE

DEVICE BUILDERS OPT FOR COMMERCIAL OFFERINGS AS CONNECTIVITY AND RICHER FEATURES

ARE REQUIRED IN DEVICES.

11

CONSUMER COMMERCE INVESTMENTS

-----------------------------

IN THE UNITED STATES, EXPEDIA, INC. COMPETES WITH TRADITIONAL TRAVEL

DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS AND ONLINE TRAVEL SERVICES SUCH AS TRAVELOCITY.COM, HOTEL

RESERVATIONS NETWORK, PRICELINE.COM, CHEAPTICKETS.COM, BIZTRAVEL.COM,

WORLDRES.COM, AND TRIP.COM.  EXPEDIA ALSO COMPETES WITH SUPPLIER-OWNED SITES

SUCH AS UNITED.COM, DELTA.COM, AND MARRIOTT.COM.  IN ADDITION, TWO NEW

COMPETITORS OWNED BY VARIOUS AIRLINES, ORBITZ AND HOTWIRE, EMERGED IN FISCAL

YEAR 2001.  INTERNATIONALLY, EXPEDIA COMPETES WITH A DIFFERENT SET OF

PARTICIPANTS IN EACH MARKET.  MICROSOFT FACES MANY COMPETITORS IN THE ONLINE

REAL ESTATE SERVICE SPACE, INCLUDING AOL'S HOUSE AND HOME CHANNEL AND HOMESTORE.

THE COMPANY ALSO FACES MANY COMPETITORS IN THE ONLINE AUTOMOTIVE SERVICE SPACE,

INCLUDING AUTOBYTEL, CARSDIRECT, AOL AUTOS, AND YAHOO! AUTOS.

OTHER

-----

PC INPUT DEVICES FACE SUBSTANTIAL COMPETITION FROM COMPUTER MANUFACTURERS, SINCE

COMPUTERS ARE TYPICALLY SOLD WITH A KEYBOARD AND MOUSE, AND OTHER MANUFACTURERS

OF THESE DEVICES.  MICROSOFT PRESS COMPETES IN THE RETAIL BOOK AND ELEARNING

MARKETS WITH PUBLISHERS THAT ALSO CREATE CONTENT ON MICROSOFT TECHNOLOGIES.  A

FEW OF THE RETAIL COMPETITORS ARE PEARSON, WROX, SYBEX, AND WILEY.  THE MAJOR

ELEARNING COMPETITORS ARE SMARTFORCE AND NETG.

EMPLOYEES

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

AS OF JUNE 30, 2001, THE COMPANY EMPLOYED APPROXIMATELY 47,600 PEOPLE ON A FULL-

TIME BASIS, 33,000 IN THE UNITED STATES AND 14,600 INTERNATIONALLY.  OF THE

TOTAL, 19,400 WERE IN PRODUCT RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, 22,500 IN SALES,

MARKETING, AND SUPPORT, 1,900 IN MANUFACTURING AND DISTRIBUTION, AND 3,800 IN

FINANCE AND ADMINISTRATION.  MICROSOFT'S SUCCESS IS HIGHLY DEPENDENT ON ITS

ABILITY TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN QUALIFIED EMPLOYEES.  COMPETITION FOR EMPLOYEES IS

INTENSE IN THE SOFTWARE INDUSTRY.  TO DATE, THE COMPANY BELIEVES IT HAS BEEN

SUCCESSFUL IN ITS EFFORTS TO RECRUIT QUALIFIED EMPLOYEES, BUT THERE IS NO

ASSURANCE THAT IT WILL CONTINUE TO BE AS SUCCESSFUL IN THE FUTURE.  NONE OF THE

COMPANY'S EMPLOYEES IS SUBJECT TO COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENTS.  THE COMPANY

BELIEVES RELATIONS WITH ITS EMPLOYEES ARE EXCELLENT.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR 1999, 2000, AND 2001

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

MICROSOFT DEVELOPS, MANUFACTURES, LICENSES, AND SUPPORTS A WIDE RANGE OF

SOFTWARE PRODUCTS FOR A MULTITUDE OF COMPUTING DEVICES.  MICROSOFT SOFTWARE

INCLUDES SCALABLE OPERATING SYSTEMS FOR SERVERS, PERSONAL COMPUTERS (PCS), AND

INTELLIGENT DEVICES; SERVER APPLICATIONS FOR CLIENT/SERVER ENVIRONMENTS;

KNOWLEDGE WORKER PRODUCTIVITY APPLICATIONS; AND SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT TOOLS.  THE

COMPANY'S ONLINE EFFORTS INCLUDE THE MSN NETWORK OF INTERNET PRODUCTS AND

SERVICES AND ALLIANCES WITH COMPANIES INVOLVED WITH BROADBAND ACCESS AND VARIOUS

FORMS OF DIGITAL INTERACTIVITY.  MICROSOFT ALSO LICENSES CONSUMER SOFTWARE

PROGRAMS; SELLS HARDWARE DEVICES; PROVIDES CONSULTING SERVICES; TRAINS AND

CERTIFIES SYSTEM INTEGRATORS AND DEVELOPERS; AND RESEARCHES AND DEVELOPS

ADVANCED TECHNOLOGIES FOR FUTURE SOFTWARE PRODUCTS.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS CONTAINS STATEMENTS THAT ARE FORWARD-

LOOKING.  THESE STATEMENTS ARE BASED ON CURRENT EXPECTATIONS AND ASSUMPTIONS

THAT ARE SUBJECT TO RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES.  ACTUAL RESULTS COULD DIFFER

MATERIALLY BECAUSE OF FACTORS DISCUSSED BELOW UNDER "ISSUES AND UNCERTAINTIES."

REVENUE

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

THE COMPANY'S REVENUE GROWTH RATE WAS 29% IN FISCAL 1999, 16% IN FISCAL 2000,

AND 10% IN FISCAL 2001.  REVENUE GROWTH IN FISCAL 2001 WAS DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY

LICENSING OF MICROSOFT WINDOWS 2000 PROFESSIONAL, MICROSOFT SQL SERVER, AND THE

OTHER .NET ENTERPRISE SERVERS.  CONSUMER SOFTWARE, SERVICES, AND DEVICES REVENUE

ALSO GREW STRONGLY.  PARTIALLY OFFSETTING THOSE ITEMS WAS FLAT REVENUE GROWTH

FROM WINDOWS MILLENNIUM EDITION (WINDOWS ME) AND WINDOWS 98 OPERATING SYSTEMS,

REFLECTING THE SLOWDOWN IN CONSUMER PC SHIPMENTS AND A HIGHER MIX OF WINDOWS

2000 PROFESSIONAL AND WINDOWS NT WORKSTATION.  REVENUE GROWTH IN FISCAL 2000 WAS

DRIVEN BY STRONG LICENSING OF MICROSOFT WINDOWS NT WORKSTATION, WINDOWS 2000

PROFESSIONAL, WINDOWS NT SERVER, WINDOWS 2000 SERVER, MICROSOFT OFFICE 2000, AND

SQL SERVER.  CONSUMER SOFTWARE, SERVICES, AND DEVICES REVENUE ALSO GREW

STRONGLY.  PARTIALLY OFFSETTING THOSE ITEMS WAS SLOWER GROWTH FROM WINDOWS

OPERATING SYSTEMS SOLD THROUGH THE ORIGINAL EQUIPMENT MANUFACTURER (OEM) CHANNEL

DUE TO SLOW DEMAND FOR BUSINESS PCS THROUGHOUT A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF FISCAL

2000.  REVENUE GROWTH IN FISCAL 1999 REFLECTED THE CONTINUED ADOPTION OF WINDOWS

OPERATING SYSTEMS AND MICROSOFT OFFICE.  IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY'S ESTIMATE FOR

FUTURE PRODUCT RETURNS WAS REDUCED BY $250 MILLION IN FISCAL 1999.

IN FISCAL 1999, MICROSOFT MADE TWO CHANGES RELATED TO THE RATABLE RECOGNITION OF

REVENUE FOR A PORTION OF ITS REVENUE FOR CERTAIN PRODUCTS.  AMERICAN INSTITUTE

OF CERTIFIED PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS (AICPA) STATEMENT OF POSITION (SOP) 98-9,

MODIFICATION OF SOP 97-2, SOFTWARE REVENUE RECOGNITION, WITH RESPECT TO CERTAIN

TRANSACTIONS, REQUIRES COMPANIES TO USE THE AVERAGE SALES PRICE OF EACH

UNDELIVERED ELEMENT OF SOFTWARE ARRANGEMENTS TO UNBUNDLE REVENUE.  PRIOR

AUTHORITATIVE ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE ALLOWED A COMPARISON OF THE TOTAL PRICE

DIFFERENTIAL BETWEEN A LICENSED PRODUCT SOLD THROUGH DIFFERENT CHANNELS OF

DISTRIBUTION TO DERIVE THE VALUE OF UNDELIVERED ELEMENTS OFFERED TO CUSTOMERS

ACQUIRING PRODUCT FROM ONE CHANNEL BUT NOT THE OTHER.  UPON ADOPTION OF THIS NEW

RULE IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF FISCAL 1999, THE PERCENTAGES OF THE TOTAL

ARRANGEMENT TREATED AS UNEARNED DECREASED.  THIS CHANGE REDUCED THE AMOUNT OF

MICROSOFT WINDOWS AND MICROSOFT OFFICE SALES TREATED AS UNEARNED AND INCREASED

THE AMOUNT OF REVENUE RECOGNIZED UPON SHIPMENT.  ADDITIONALLY, AS PART OF THE

COMPANY'S LONG RANGE PLANNING PROCESS AND A REVIEW OF PRODUCT SHIPMENT CYCLES,

IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THE LIFE CYCLE OF WINDOWS SHOULD BE EXTENDED FROM TWO

YEARS TO THREE YEARS.

PRODUCT REVENUE

MICROSOFT HAS FOUR SEGMENTS:  DESKTOP AND ENTERPRISE SOFTWARE AND SERVICES;

CONSUMER SOFTWARE, SERVICES, AND DEVICES; CONSUMER COMMERCE INVESTMENTS; AND

OTHER.  THE MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS PRESENTATION OF REVENUE DIFFERS

FROM THAT REPORTED UNDER THE COMPANY'S SEGMENT INFORMATION APPEARING IN THE

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS BECAUSE RECONCILING ITEMS ARE ALLOCATED TO THOSE

SEGMENTS.

18

DESKTOP AND ENTERPRISE SOFTWARE AND SERVICES

DESKTOP AND ENTERPRISE SOFTWARE AND SERVICES REVENUE WAS $17.84 BILLION, $20.40

BILLION, AND $22.41 BILLION IN 1999, 2000, AND 2001.  DESKTOP AND ENTERPRISE

SOFTWARE AND SERVICES INCLUDES DESKTOP APPLICATIONS; DESKTOP PLATFORMS; AND

ENTERPRISE SOFTWARE AND SERVICES.

DESKTOP APPLICATIONS REVENUE WAS $7.77 BILLION, $9.30 BILLION, AND $9.54 BILLION

IN 1999, 2000, AND 2001.  DESKTOP APPLICATIONS INCLUDES REVENUE FROM MICROSOFT

OFFICE; MICROSOFT PROJECT; VISIO; CLIENT ACCESS LICENSES (CALS) FOR WINDOWS NT

SERVER AND WINDOWS 2000 SERVER, EXCHANGE, AND BACKOFFICE; MICROSOFT GREAT

PLAINS; AND BCENTRAL.  IN FISCAL 2001, REVENUE FROM CLIENT ACCESS LICENSES

INCREASED 14% REFLECTING STRONG LICENSING GROWTH OF WINDOWS NT SERVER AND

WINDOWS 2000 SERVER CALS.  OFFICE REVENUE GROWTH WAS FLAT DURING THE YEAR.  IN

FISCAL 2000 AND 1999, REVENUE GROWTH FROM MICROSOFT OFFICE INTEGRATED SUITES,

INCLUDING THE PREMIUM, PROFESSIONAL, SMALL BUSINESS, AND STANDARD EDITIONS WERE

VERY SOLID.

DESKTOP PLATFORMS REVENUE WAS $6.74 BILLION, $7.02 BILLION, AND $8.04 BILLION IN

1999, 2000, AND 2001.  DESKTOP PLATFORMS INCLUDES REVENUE FROM WINDOWS 2000

PROFESSIONAL, WINDOWS NT WORKSTATION, WINDOWS ME, WINDOWS 98, AND OTHER DESKTOP

OPERATING SYSTEMS.  FISCAL 2001 REVENUE GROWTH REFLECTED THE STRONG ADOPTION OF

WINDOWS 2000 PROFESSIONAL, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY FLAT REVENUE GROWTH FROM WINDOWS

ME AND WINDOWS 98 OPERATING SYSTEMS, REFLECTING THE SLOWDOWN IN CONSUMER PC

SHIPMENTS AND A HIGHER MIX OF WINDOWS 2000 PROFESSIONAL AND WINDOWS NT

WORKSTATION.  IN FISCAL 2000, DESKTOP PLATFORMS REVENUE GROWTH WAS MODEST DUE TO

SOFT DEMAND FOR BUSINESS PCS DURING MOST OF THE YEAR; A SLOWDOWN IN SHIPMENTS IN

ANTICIPATION OF THE POST MID-YEAR AVAILABILITY OF WINDOWS 2000 OPERATING

SYSTEMS; AND, AS EXPECTED, A LONGER BUSINESS MIGRATION CYCLE FOR THE NEWEST

WINDOWS OPERATING SYSTEM OFFERINGS.  IN FISCAL 1999, WINDOWS UNITS LICENSED

THROUGH THE OEM CHANNEL, PARTICULARLY WINDOWS NT WORKSTATION, INCREASED STRONGLY

OVER THE PRIOR YEAR.  ORGANIZATIONAL LICENSING OF WINDOWS NT WORKSTATION AND

WINDOWS 98 ALSO CONTRIBUTED TO THE GROWTH.

ENTERPRISE SOFTWARE AND SERVICES REVENUE WAS $3.33 BILLION, $4.08 BILLION, AND

$4.83 BILLION IN 1999, 2000, AND 2001.  ENTERPRISE SOFTWARE AND SERVICES

INCLUDES ENTERPRISE PLATFORMS, SERVER APPLICATIONS, DEVELOPER TOOLS AND

SERVICES, AND ENTERPRISE SERVICES.  AS A RESULT OF THE CONTINUED ADOPTION OF

MICROSOFT'S .NET ENTERPRISE SERVER OFFERINGS IN FISCAL 2001, SERVER APPLICATIONS

REVENUE INCREASED 31% VERSUS THE PRIOR YEAR.  ENTERPRISE SERVICES REVENUE,

REPRESENTING CONSULTING AND PRODUCT SUPPORT SERVICES, WAS UP 34% COMPARED TO

FISCAL 2000.  ENTERPRISE PLATFORMS, WHICH INCLUDES WINDOWS 2000 SERVER AND

WINDOWS NT SERVER OPERATING SYSTEMS, INCREASED 10% WHILE REVENUE FROM DEVELOPER

TOOLS AND SERVICES WAS FLAT WITH THE PRIOR YEAR.  IN FISCAL 2000, ENTERPRISE

PLATFORMS REVENUE GROWTH WAS PARTICULARLY STRONG LED BY INCREASED ADOPTION BY

CUSTOMERS OF WINDOWS NT SERVER AND WINDOWS 2000 SERVER.  REVENUE FROM SERVER

APPLICATIONS GREW STRONGLY, LARGELY DUE TO THE STRONG SUCCESS OF SQL SERVER 7.0.

SOFTWARE DEVELOPER TOOLS AND SERVICES REVENUE DECLINED, DUE TO INCREASED SUITE

LICENSING VERSUS STAND-ALONE LICENSES, AND THE LACK OF A RELEASE UPGRADE OF THE

VISUAL STUDIO DEVELOPMENT SYSTEM.  IN FISCAL 1999, THE REVENUE GROWTH RATE FOR

WINDOWS NT SERVER WAS HEALTHY.  REVENUE FROM SERVER APPLICATIONS GREW STRONGLY,

REFLECTING, IN PART, THE RELEASE OF SQL SERVER 7.0.  THE VISUAL STUDIO 6.0

DEVELOPMENT SYSTEM DROVE HEALTHY DEVELOPER TOOLS AND SERVICES REVENUE GROWTH.

CONSULTING SERVICES REVENUE ROSE SUBSTANTIALLY.

CONSUMER SOFTWARE, SERVICES, AND DEVICES

CONSUMER SOFTWARE, SERVICES, AND DEVICES REVENUE WAS $1.19 BILLION, $1.63

BILLION, AND $1.95 BILLION IN 1999, 2000, AND 2001.  CONSUMER SOFTWARE,

SERVICES, AND DEVICES INCLUDES MSN INTERNET ACCESS; MSN NETWORK SERVICE; WEBTV

INTERNET ACCESS AND SERVICES; PC AND ONLINE GAMES; LEARNING AND PRODUCTIVITY

SOFTWARE; MOBILE AND WIRELESS DEVICES; AND EMBEDDED SYSTEMS.  IN FISCAL 2001,

REVENUE FROM MSN NETWORK SERVICES GREW STRONGLY IN LIGHT OF THE DECLINE IN THE

ONLINE ADVERTISING MARKET.  MSN INTERNET ACCESS REVENUE ALSO GREW SOLIDLY AS A

RESULT OF AN INCREASED SUBSCRIBER BASE, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECLINE IN THE

AVERAGE REVENUE PER SUBSCRIBER DUE TO A LARGER MIX OF SUBSCRIBERS CONTRACTED

UNDER REBATE PROGRAMS.  REVENUE FROM EMBEDDED SYSTEMS GREW STRONGLY FROM THE

PRIOR YEAR, WHILE LEARNING AND PRODUCTIVITY SOFTWARE REVENUE AND PC AND ONLINE

GAMES REVENUE DECLINED, REFLECTING SOFTNESS IN THE OVERALL CONSUMER MARKET.  IN

FISCAL 2000, ONLINE REVENUE GROWTH WAS VERY STRONG AND REFLECTED HIGHER

SUBSCRIBER TOTALS, OFFSET BY LOWER NET PRICES FOR INTERNET ACCESS SUBSCRIPTIONS

COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR.  ADDITIONALLY, STRONG SELL-THROUGH OF ENTERTAINMENT

SOFTWARE PRODUCED ROBUST REVENUE GROWTH.  IN FISCAL 1999, ONLINE ADVERTISING

REVENUE ROSE SUBSTANTIALLY AND INTERNET ACCESS REVENUE INCREASED MODERATELY.

19

CONSUMER COMMERCE INVESTMENTS

CONSUMER COMMERCE INVESTMENTS REVENUE WAS $62 MILLION, $182 MILLION, AND $299

MILLION IN 1999, 2000, AND 2001.  CONSUMER COMMERCE INVESTMENTS INCLUDE EXPEDIA,

INC., THE HOMEADVISOR ONLINE REAL ESTATE SERVICE, AND THE CARPOINT ONLINE

AUTOMOTIVE SERVICE.  ACQUISITIONS OF TRAVELSCAPE.COM AND VACATIONSPOT.COM BY

EXPEDIA, INC., AND INCREASED PRODUCT OFFERINGS FROM EXPEDIA LED TO THE STRONG

REVENUE GROWTH IN FISCAL 2001.  THE INCREASED OVERALL REACH OF ALL PROPERTIES

LED TO THE STRONG REVENUE GROWTH IN FISCAL 2000 AND 1999.

ON JULY 16, 2001, USA NETWORKS, INC. (USA) ANNOUNCED AN AGREEMENT TO ACQUIRE A

CONTROLLING INTEREST IN EXPEDIA THROUGH THE PURCHASE OF UP TO 37.5 MILLION

SHARES, APPROXIMATELY 75% OF THE CURRENT OUTSTANDING SHARES.  IF HOLDERS OF MORE

THAN 37.5 MILLION EXPEDIA SHARES ELECT TO SELL THEIR SHARES TO USA, THERE WILL

BE A PRO RATA REDUCTION AMONG ALL ELECTING SHAREHOLDERS.  MICROSOFT HAS AGREED

TO TRANSFER ALL OF ITS 33.7 MILLION SHARES AND WARRANTS, SUBJECT TO PRO-RATION.

IT IS EXPECTED THAT THE TRANSACTION WILL CLOSE BY DECEMBER 31, 2001.

OTHER

OTHER REVENUE WAS $653 MILLION, $754 MILLION, AND $630 MILLION IN 1999, 2000,

AND 2001.  OTHER PRIMARILY INCLUDES HARDWARE AND MICROSOFT PRESS.  LOWER SALES

OF GAMING DEVICES AND OTHER HARDWARE PERIPHERALS AS A RESULT OF WEAKNESS IN THE

CONSUMER MARKET CAUSED THE DECLINE IN REVENUE IN FISCAL 2001.  CONTINUED SUCCESS

OF THE COMPANY'S NEW HARDWARE DEVICE OFFERINGS LED TO THE REVENUE GROWTH IN

FISCAL 2000.  REVENUE FROM HARDWARE DEVICES AND MICROSOFT PRESS WAS RELATIVELY

FLAT IN FISCAL 1999.

DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS

MICROSOFT DISTRIBUTES ITS PRODUCTS PRIMARILY THROUGH OEM LICENSES,

ORGANIZATIONAL LICENSES, ONLINE SERVICES AND PRODUCTS, AND RETAIL PACKAGED

PRODUCTS.  OEM CHANNEL REVENUE REPRESENTS LICENSE FEES FROM ORIGINAL EQUIPMENT

MANUFACTURERS WHO PREINSTALL MICROSOFT PRODUCTS, PRIMARILY ON PCS.  MICROSOFT

HAS THREE MAJOR GEOGRAPHIC SALES AND MARKETING REGIONS: THE SOUTH PACIFIC AND

AMERICAS REGION; THE EUROPE, MIDDLE EAST, AND AFRICA REGION; AND THE ASIA

REGION.  SALES OF ORGANIZATIONAL LICENSES AND PACKAGED PRODUCTS VIA THESE

CHANNELS ARE PRIMARILY TO AND THROUGH DISTRIBUTORS AND RESELLERS.

OEM REVENUE WAS $6.40 BILLION IN 1999, $7.01 BILLION IN 2000, AND $7.86 BILLION

IN 2001.  ALTHOUGH TOTAL LICENSES WERE IMPACTED BY A SLOWDOWN IN PC SHIPMENTS IN

FISCAL 2001, THE MIX OF THE HIGHER PRICED WINDOWS 2000 PROFESSIONAL AND WINDOWS

NT WORKSTATION IN THE OEM CHANNEL INCREASED SUBSTANTIALLY RESULTING IN HIGHER

AVERAGE REVENUE PER LICENSE.  THE RELATIVELY LOW GROWTH RATE IN FISCAL 2000 WAS

DUE TO LOWER BUSINESS PC SHIPMENT GROWTH, ESPECIALLY AS A RESULT OF THE SOFT

DEMAND FOR BUSINESS PCS AND COMPONENT SHORTAGES FOR PART OF THE YEAR.  THESE

ISSUES COMBINED WITH POST MID-YEAR AVAILABILITY OF WINDOWS 2000 PROFESSIONAL

RESULTED IN LOWER REVENUE GROWTH.  AVERAGE EARNED REVENUE PER LICENSE ALSO

DECLINED COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR, DUE IN PART TO A MIX SHIFT TO THE LOWER-

PRICED WINDOWS 98 OPERATING SYSTEM REFLECTING THE SOFTNESS IN DEMAND FOR

BUSINESS PCS AND LOWER PRICES ON OPERATING SYSTEMS LICENSED THROUGH CERTAIN OEM

CHANNEL SECTORS.  IN FISCAL 1999, PC SHIPMENT GROWTH COUPLED WITH AN INCREASED

PENETRATION OF HIGHER VALUE 32-BIT OPERATING SYSTEMS DROVE THE OEM REVENUE

INCREASES.

SOUTH PACIFIC AND AMERICAS REGION REVENUE WAS $7.25 BILLION, $8.33 BILLION, AND

$9.52 BILLION IN 1999, 2000, AND 2001.  IN FISCAL 2001, REVENUE GROWTH,

PRINCIPALLY IN THE UNITED STATES, WAS LED BY STRONG LICENSING OF WINDOWS 2000

PROFESSIONAL AND THE FAMILY OF .NET ENTERPRISE SERVERS, PARTICULARLY SQL SERVER

2000 AND EXCHANGE 2000 SERVER.  REVENUE FROM ENTERPRISE SERVICES AND MSN

SUBSCRIPTION AND SERVICES GREW STRONGLY.  IN FISCAL 2000, OFFICE 2000 INTEGRATED

SUITES, WINDOWS 2000 SERVER, ONLINE REVENUE, AND SQL SERVER SALES WERE THE

PRIMARY DRIVERS OF THE REVENUE GROWTH.  STRONG RETAIL SALES OF HARDWARE DEVICES

AND CONSUMER SOFTWARE ALSO CONTRIBUTED TO THE GROWTH OVER THE PRIOR YEAR.

REVENUE GROWTH WAS PARTICULARLY STRONG IN LATIN AMERICA AND AUSTRALIA, MODERATE

IN CANADA, AND MODEST IN THE UNITED STATES.  IN FISCAL 1999, SERVER

APPLICATIONS, WINDOWS NT SERVER, WINDOWS NT WORKSTATION, AND MICROSOFT OFFICE

ALL EXHIBITED SOLID YEAR-OVER-YEAR GROWTH RATES.  ORGANIZATIONAL LICENSING

ACTIVITY WAS STRONG.  REVENUE GROWTH WAS SOLID IN THE UNITED STATES AND MODERATE

IN LATIN AMERICA AND THE SOUTH PACIFIC.

EUROPE, MIDDLE EAST, AND AFRICA REGION REVENUE WAS $4.33 BILLION, $5.02 BILLION,

AND $4.86 BILLION IN 1999, 2000, AND 2001.  IN FISCAL 2001, WEAKENING LOCAL

CURRENCIES NEGATIVELY IMPACTED TRANSLATED REVENUE COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR.

REVENUE IN THE REGION WOULD HAVE INCREASED 6% IF FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES WERE

CONSTANT WITH THOSE OF THE PRIOR YEAR.  REVENUE FROM WINDOWS 2000 PROFESSIONAL

AND THE .NET ENTERPRISE SERVER FAMILY OF PRODUCTS WAS VERY HEALTHY.  IN FISCAL

2000, RETAIL SALES OF WINDOWS OPERATING SYSTEMS AND OFFICE LICENSING PRODUCED

MODERATE GROWTH IN THE REGION.  GROWTH FROM SQL SERVER LICENSING, NEW

20

HARDWARE DEVICE OFFERINGS, AND ENTERTAINMENT SOFTWARE WAS ESPECIALLY STRONG.

REVENUE GROWTH, MEASURED IN CONSTANT DOLLARS, WAS VERY HEALTHY IN GERMANY AND

ITALY, ROBUST IN THE MIDDLE EAST, AND LOW IN THE UNITED KINGDOM. IN FISCAL 1999,

ALL MAJOR PRODUCTS GREW STRONGLY OVER THE PRIOR YEAR. REVENUE GROWTH WAS SOLID

IN THE UNITED KINGDOM, GERMANY, AND FRANCE, AND WAS PARTICULARLY HIGH IN SWEDEN,

THE NETHERLANDS, AND SPAIN.

ASIA REGION REVENUE WAS $1.78 BILLION IN 1999, $2.60 BILLION IN 2000, AND $3.06

BILLION IN 2001.  IN FISCAL 2001, THE REGION'S GROWTH RATE REFLECTED STRONG

REVENUE FROM LOCALIZED VERSIONS OF MICROSOFT OFFICE 2000 AND MICROSOFT OFFICE

XP, ESPECIALLY THE OFFICE PERSONAL SUITE.  THE GROWTH WAS ALSO ATTRIBUTABLE TO

WINDOWS 2000 PROFESSIONAL AND .NET SERVER APPLICATIONS LICENSING.  REVENUE

GROWTH WAS PARTICULARLY STRONG IN KOREA AND THE GREATER CHINA REGION, RESULTING

FROM ADVANTAGEOUS ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AS WELL AS SUCCESSFUL ANTI-PIRACY EFFORTS.

IN FISCAL 2000, THE REGION'S GROWTH RATE REFLECTED STRONG PERFORMANCE RESULTING

FROM IMPROVED LOCAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS.  REVENUE GROWTH WAS ALSO INFLUENCED BY

ROBUST GROWTH OF LOCALIZED VERSIONS OF MICROSOFT OFFICE 2000, ESPECIALLY THE

OFFICE PERSONAL EDITION SOLD IN JAPAN, WINDOWS PLATFORM AND SERVER LICENSING,

AND STRONG ADOPTION OF SQL SERVER.  REVENUE GREW STRONGLY IN NEARLY ALL

COUNTRIES IN THE ASIA REGION.  IN FISCAL 1999, JAPAN, TAIWAN, CHINA, HONG KONG,

AND SOUTHEAST ASIA HAD MODERATE REVENUE GROWTH, WHILE REVENUE GREW VERY STRONGLY

IN KOREA.

THE COMPANY'S OPERATING RESULTS ARE AFFECTED BY FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES.

APPROXIMATELY 29%, 30%, AND 27% OF THE COMPANY'S REVENUE WAS COLLECTED IN

FOREIGN CURRENCIES DURING 1999, 2000, AND 2001.  SINCE A PORTION OF LOCAL

CURRENCY REVENUE IS HEDGED AND MUCH OF THE COMPANY'S INTERNATIONAL MANUFACTURING

COSTS AND OPERATING EXPENSES ARE ALSO INCURRED IN LOCAL CURRENCIES, THE IMPACT

OF EXCHANGE RATES IS PARTIALLY MITIGATED.

OPERATING EXPENSES

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

COST OF REVENUE

COST OF REVENUE AS A PERCENT OF REVENUE WAS 14.3% IN 1999, 13.1% IN 2000, AND

13.7% IN 2001.  IN FISCAL 2001, HIGHER SUPPORT AND SERVICE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH

THE MSN INTERNET ACCESS AND MSN NETWORK SERVICES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE

LOWER RELATIVE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH ORGANIZATIONAL LICENSING AND THE DROP IN

THE MIX OF PACKAGED PRODUCT VERSUS THE PRIOR YEAR.  COST OF REVENUE IN FISCAL

2000 REFLECTED LOWER COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH WEBTV NETWORKS' OPERATIONS, PARTIALLY

OFFSET BY THE GROWTH IN HARDWARE PERIPHERALS COSTS.  COST OF REVENUE AS A

PERCENTAGE OF REVENUE DECREASED IN FISCAL 1999 PRIMARILY DUE TO THE TREND IN MIX

SHIFT TO OEM AND ORGANIZATIONAL LICENSES.  ADDITIONALLY, COST OF REVENUE IN 1999

WAS POSITIVELY IMPACTED BY A REDUCTION IN ESTIMATES OF OBSOLETE INVENTORY AND

OTHER MANUFACTURING COSTS OF $67 MILLION.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

MICROSOFT CONTINUED TO INVEST HEAVILY IN THE FUTURE BY FUNDING RESEARCH AND

DEVELOPMENT (R&D;).  IN FISCAL 2001, THE INCREASE IN R&D; EXPENSE WAS THE RESULT

OF HIGHER HEADCOUNT-RELATED COSTS AND INVESTMENTS IN NEW PRODUCT INITIATIVES.

THE INCREASE IN FISCAL 2000 WAS DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY HIGHER HEADCOUNT-RELATED

COSTS.  THE INCREASE IN FISCAL 1999 REFLECTED HIGHER DEVELOPMENT HEADCOUNT-

RELATED COSTS OFFSET BY LOWER INFRASTRUCTURE AND THIRD-PARTY DEVELOPMENT COSTS.

SALES AND MARKETING

IN FISCAL 2001, SALES AND MARKETING EXPENSES AS A PERCENTAGE OF REVENUE

INCREASED DUE TO HIGHER RELATIVE HEADCOUNT-RELATED COSTS, HIGHER MARKETING AND

SALES EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH MSN, THE MICROSOFT AGILITY ADVERTISING CAMPAIGN,

AND OTHER NEW SALES INITIATIVES.  IN FISCAL 2000, SALES AND MARKETING EXPENSES

AS A PERCENTAGE OF REVENUE INCREASED DUE TO HIGHER RELATIVE MARKETING COSTS

ASSOCIATED WITH NEW PRODUCT RELEASES AND ONLINE MARKETING.  IN FISCAL 1999,

SALES AND MARKETING EXPENSE AS A PERCENTAGE OF REVENUE DECREASED DUE TO LOWER

RELATIVE SALES EXPENSES AND LOWER RELATIVE MARKETING COSTS.

GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE

IN FISCAL 2001, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS DECREASED DUE TO A CHARGE

RELATED TO THE SETTLEMENT OF THE LAWSUIT WITH CALDERA, INC. RECORDED IN FISCAL

2000.  EXCLUDING THIS CHARGE, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES IN FISCAL 2001

INCREASED FROM THE PRIOR YEAR DUE TO HIGHER HEADCOUNT-RELATED COSTS AND LEGAL

FEES.  FOR FISCAL 2000, BESIDES THE SETTLEMENT OF THE LAWSUIT, GENERAL AND

ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES ALSO REFLECTED INCREASED LEGAL FEES AND CERTAIN EMPLOYEE

STOCK OPTION-RELATED EXPENSES.  THE INCREASE IN FISCAL YEAR 1999 WAS

ATTRIBUTABLE TO HIGHER LEGAL FEES, SETTLEMENT COSTS, AND HEADCOUNT-RELATED COSTS

NECESSARY TO SUPPORT THE COMPANY'S EXPANDING OPERATIONS.

21

NON-OPERATING ITEMS, INVESTMENT INCOME/(LOSS), AND INCOME TAXES

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

LOSSES ON EQUITY INVESTEES AND OTHER INCORPORATES MICROSOFT'S SHARE OF INCOME OR

LOSS FROM THE MSNBC ENTITIES, AVANADE, WIRELESS KNOWLEDGE, STARBAND

COMMUNICATIONS, AND OTHER INVESTMENTS ACCOUNTED FOR USING THE EQUITY METHOD.

THE INCREASE IN LOSSES ON EQUITY INVESTEES AND OTHER IN FISCAL 2001 REFLECTS AN

INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF SUCH INVESTMENTS DURING THE YEAR.  IN FISCAL 2000 AND

1999, LOSSES ON EQUITY INVESTEES DECREASED REFLECTING SMALLER LOSSES FROM THE

MSNBC ENTITIES.

IN FISCAL 2001, THE COMPANY REPORTED AN INVESTMENT LOSS OF $36 MILLION, A

DECREASE IN INVESTMENT INCOME OF $3.36 BILLION VERSUS FISCAL 2000.  NET

RECOGNIZED LOSSES WERE $2.22 BILLION IN FISCAL 2001, REFLECTING $4.80 BILLION IN

IMPAIRMENTS OF CERTAIN INVESTMENTS, PRIMARILY IN THE CABLE AND TELECOMMUNICATION

INDUSTRIES, AND $592 MILLION OF NET LOSSES ATTRIBUTABLE TO DERIVATIVE

INSTRUMENTS.  THESE LOSSES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER NET GAINS FROM THE

SALES OF INVESTMENTS, INCLUDING A GAIN FROM MICROSOFT'S INVESTMENT IN TITUS

COMMUNICATIONS (WHICH WAS MERGED WITH JUPITER TELECOMMUNICATIONS) AND THE

CLOSING OF THE SALE OF TRANSPOINT TO CHECKFREE HOLDINGS CORP.  INTEREST AND

DIVIDEND INCOME INCREASED $591 MILLION FROM THE PRIOR YEAR, REFLECTING A LARGER

INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO.  IN FISCAL YEARS 2000 AND 1999, INVESTMENT INCOME

INCREASED PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF A LARGER INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO GENERATED BY

CASH FROM OPERATIONS COUPLED WITH REALIZED GAINS FROM THE SALE OF SECURITIES.

THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR FISCAL 2001 WAS 33%.  THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR

FISCAL 2000 WAS 34%.  EXCLUDING THE IMPACT OF THE GAIN ON THE SALE OF SOFTIMAGE,

INC., THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR FISCAL 1999 WAS 35%.

ACCOUNTING CHANGE

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

EFFECTIVE JULY 1, 2000, MICROSOFT ADOPTED STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING

STANDARDS (SFAS) 133, ACCOUNTING FOR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING

ACTIVITIES, WHICH ESTABLISHES ACCOUNTING AND REPORTING STANDARDS FOR DERIVATIVE

INSTRUMENTS, INCLUDING CERTAIN DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS EMBEDDED IN OTHER

CONTRACTS AND FOR HEDGING ACTIVITIES.  ALL DERIVATIVES, WHETHER DESIGNATED IN

HEDGING RELATIONSHIPS OR NOT, ARE REQUIRED TO BE RECORDED ON THE BALANCE SHEET

AT FAIR VALUE.  IF THE DERIVATIVE IS DESIGNATED AS A FAIR VALUE HEDGE, THE

CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE DERIVATIVE AND THE HEDGED ITEM ARE RECOGNIZED

IN EARNINGS.  IF THE DERIVATIVE IS DESIGNATED AS A CASH FLOW HEDGE, CHANGES IN

THE FAIR VALUE OF THE DERIVATIVE ARE RECORDED IN OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME

(OCI) AND ARE RECOGNIZED IN THE INCOME STATEMENT WHEN THE HEDGED ITEM AFFECTS

EARNINGS.

THE ADOPTION OF SFAS 133 RESULTED IN A CUMULATIVE PRE-TAX REDUCTION TO INCOME OF

$560 MILLION ($375 MILLION AFTER-TAX) AND A CUMULATIVE PRE-TAX REDUCTION TO OCI

OF $112 MILLION ($75 MILLION AFTER-TAX).  THE REDUCTION TO INCOME WAS MOSTLY

ATTRIBUTABLE TO A LOSS OF APPROXIMATELY $300 MILLION RECLASSIFIED FROM OCI FOR

THE TIME VALUE OF OPTIONS AND A LOSS OF APPROXIMATELY $250 MILLION RECLASSIFIED

FROM OCI FOR DERIVATIVES NOT DESIGNATED AS HEDGING INSTRUMENTS.  THE REDUCTION

TO OCI WAS MOSTLY ATTRIBUTABLE TO LOSSES OF APPROXIMATELY $670 MILLION ON CASH

FLOW HEDGES OFFSET BY THE RECLASSIFICATIONS OUT OF OCI OF THE APPROXIMATELY $300

MILLION LOSS FOR THE TIME VALUE OF OPTIONS AND THE APPROXIMATELY $250 MILLION

LOSS FOR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS NOT DESIGNATED AS HEDGING INSTRUMENTS.

FINANCIAL CONDITION

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

THE COMPANY'S CASH AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO TOTALED $31.60 BILLION AT

JUNE 30, 2001.  THE PORTFOLIO CONSISTS PRIMARILY OF FIXED-INCOME SECURITIES,

DIVERSIFIED AMONG INDUSTRIES AND INDIVIDUAL ISSUERS.  MICROSOFT'S INVESTMENTS

ARE GENERALLY LIQUID AND INVESTMENT GRADE.  THE PORTFOLIO IS INVESTED

PREDOMINANTLY IN U.S. DOLLAR DENOMINATED SECURITIES, BUT ALSO INCLUDES FOREIGN

CURRENCY POSITIONS IN ORDER TO DIVERSIFY FINANCIAL RISK.  THE PORTFOLIO IS

PRIMARILY INVESTED IN SHORT-TERM SECURITIES TO MINIMIZE INTEREST RATE RISK AND

FACILITATE RAPID DEPLOYMENT FOR IMMEDIATE CASH NEEDS.

CASH FLOW FROM OPERATIONS WAS $13.42 BILLION IN FISCAL 2001, AN INCREASE OF

$2.00 BILLION FROM THE PRIOR YEAR.  THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO

THE GROWTH IN REVENUE AND OTHER CHANGES IN WORKING CAPITAL, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY

THE DECREASE IN THE STOCK OPTION INCOME TAX BENEFIT, REFLECTING DECREASED STOCK

OPTION EXERCISES BY EMPLOYEES.  CASH USED FOR FINANCING WAS $5.59 BILLION IN

FISCAL 2001, AN INCREASE OF $3.39 BILLION FROM THE PRIOR YEAR.  THE INCREASE

PRIMARILY REFLECTS THE REPURCHASE OF PUT WARRANTS IN FISCAL 2001, COMPARED TO

THE SALE OF PUT WARRANTS IN THE PRIOR FISCAL YEAR, AS WELL AS AN INCREASE IN

COMMON STOCK REPURCHASED.  ALL OUTSTANDING PUT WARRANTS WERE EITHER RETIRED OR

EXERCISED DURING FISCAL 2001.  DURING FISCAL

22

2001, THE COMPANY REPURCHASED 89.0 MILLION SHARES. CASH USED FOR INVESTING WAS

$8.73 BILLION IN FISCAL 2001, A DECREASE OF $658 MILLION FROM THE PRIOR YEAR.

IN FISCAL 2000, CASH FLOW FROM OPERATIONS WAS $11.43 BILLION, A DECREASE OF $720

MILLION FROM THE PRIOR YEAR, REFLECTING WORKING CAPITAL CHANGES PARTIALLY OFFSET

BY THE INCREASE IN THE STOCK OPTION INCOME TAX BENEFIT.  CASH USED FOR FINANCING

WAS $2.19 BILLION IN FISCAL 2000, AN INCREASE OF $1.33 BILLION FROM THE PRIOR

YEAR, REFLECTING AN INCREASE IN COMMON STOCK REPURCHASED VERSUS THE PRIOR YEAR.

DURING FISCAL 2000, THE COMPANY REPURCHASED 55.2 MILLION SHARES.  CASH USED FOR

INVESTING WAS $9.39 BILLION IN FISCAL 2000, A DECREASE OF $808 MILLION FROM THE

PRIOR YEAR.  IN FISCAL 1999, CASH FLOW FROM OPERATIONS WAS $12.15 BILLION, AN

INCREASE OF $3.78 BILLION FROM THE PRIOR YEAR, REFLECTING THE GROWTH IN REVENUE

AND THE INCREASE IN THE STOCK OPTION INCOME TAX BENEFIT.  CASH USED FOR

FINANCING WAS $862 MILLION IN FISCAL 1999, A DECREASE OF $137 MILLION FROM THE

PRIOR YEAR.  DURING FISCAL 1999, THE COMPANY REPURCHASED 44.9 MILLION SHARES.

CASH USED FOR INVESTING WAS $10.20 BILLION IN FISCAL 1999, AN INCREASE OF $3.00

BILLION FROM THE PRIOR YEAR, REFLECTING THE GROWTH IN THE INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO.

MICROSOFT HAS NO MATERIAL LONG-TERM DEBT.  STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY AT JUNE 30, 2001

WAS $47.29 BILLION.  MICROSOFT WILL CONTINUE TO INVEST IN SALES, MARKETING, AND

PRODUCT SUPPORT INFRASTRUCTURE.  ADDITIONALLY, RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

ACTIVITIES WILL INCLUDE INVESTMENTS IN EXISTING AND ADVANCED AREAS OF

TECHNOLOGY, INCLUDING USING CASH TO ACQUIRE TECHNOLOGY.  ADDITIONS TO PROPERTY

AND EQUIPMENT WILL CONTINUE, INCLUDING NEW FACILITIES AND COMPUTER SYSTEMS FOR

R&D;, SALES AND MARKETING, SUPPORT, AND ADMINISTRATIVE STAFF.  COMMITMENTS FOR

CONSTRUCTING NEW BUILDINGS WERE $181 MILLION ON JUNE 30, 2001.  CASH WILL ALSO

BE USED FOR STRATEGIC OPPORTUNITIES.

IN ADDITION, CASH WILL BE USED TO REPURCHASE COMMON STOCK TO PROVIDE SHARES FOR

EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTION AND PURCHASE PLANS.  SINCE FISCAL 1990, MICROSOFT HAS

REPURCHASED 854 MILLION COMMON SHARES WHILE 2.12 BILLION SHARES WERE ISSUED

UNDER THE COMPANY'S EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTION AND PURCHASE PLANS.  THE MARKET VALUE

OF ALL OUTSTANDING STOCK OPTIONS WAS $66 BILLION AS OF JUNE 30, 2001.  DURING

DECEMBER 1996, MICROSOFT ISSUED 12.5 MILLION SHARES OF 2.75% CONVERTIBLE

EXCHANGEABLE PREFERRED STOCK.  THE COMPANY'S CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK MATURED

ON DECEMBER 15, 1999.  EACH PREFERRED SHARE WAS CONVERTED INTO 1.1273 COMMON

SHARES.

MANAGEMENT BELIEVES EXISTING CASH AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS TOGETHER WITH FUNDS

GENERATED FROM OPERATIONS SHOULD BE SUFFICIENT TO MEET OPERATING REQUIREMENTS.

THE COMPANY'S CASH AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS ARE AVAILABLE FOR STRATEGIC

INVESTMENTS, MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS, AND OTHER POTENTIAL LARGE-SCALE NEEDS AND

TO FUND THE SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM.  MICROSOFT HAS NOT PAID CASH DIVIDENDS ON

ITS COMMON STOCK.

RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

IN JUNE 2001, THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD ISSUED SFAS 141, BUSINESS

COMBINATIONS, AND SFAS 142, GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS.  SFAS 141

REQUIRES BUSINESS COMBINATIONS INITIATED AFTER JUNE 30, 2001 TO BE ACCOUNTED FOR

USING THE PURCHASE METHOD OF ACCOUNTING.  IT ALSO SPECIFIES THE TYPES OF

ACQUIRED INTANGIBLE ASSETS THAT ARE REQUIRED TO BE RECOGNIZED AND REPORTED

SEPARATELY FROM GOODWILL.  SFAS 142 WILL REQUIRE THAT GOODWILL AND CERTAIN

INTANGIBLES NO LONGER BE AMORTIZED, BUT INSTEAD TESTED FOR IMPAIRMENT AT LEAST

ANNUALLY.  SFAS 142 IS REQUIRED TO BE APPLIED STARTING WITH FISCAL YEARS

BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2001, WITH EARLY APPLICATION PERMITTED IN CERTAIN

CIRCUMSTANCES.  THE COMPANY PLANS TO EARLY ADOPT SFAS 142 IN FISCAL 2002 AND

DOES NOT EXPECT ANY IMPAIRMENT OF GOODWILL UPON ADOPTION.  GOODWILL AMORTIZATION

WAS APPROXIMATELY $300 MILLION IN FISCAL 2001 AND APPROXIMATELY $225 MILLION IN

FISCAL 2000.

ISSUES AND UNCERTAINTIES

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

WHILE MICROSOFT MANAGEMENT IS OPTIMISTIC ABOUT THE COMPANY'S LONG-TERM

PROSPECTS, THE FOLLOWING ISSUES AND UNCERTAINTIES, AMONG OTHERS, SHOULD BE

CONSIDERED IN EVALUATING ITS GROWTH OUTLOOK.

RAPID TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE AND COMPETITION

RAPID CHANGE, UNCERTAINTY DUE TO NEW AND EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES, AND FIERCE

COMPETITION CHARACTERIZE THE SOFTWARE INDUSTRY, WHICH MEANS THAT MICROSOFT'S

MARKET POSITION IS ALWAYS AT RISK.  MICROSOFT'S ABILITY TO MAINTAIN ITS CURRENT

MARKET SHARE MAY DEPEND UPON THE COMPANY'S ABILITY TO SATISFY CUSTOMER

REQUIREMENTS, ENHANCE EXISTING PRODUCTS, DEVELOP AND INTRODUCE NEW PRODUCTS AND

ACHIEVE MARKET ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH PRODUCTS.  THIS PROCESS GROWS MORE CHALLENGING

AS THE PACE OF CHANGE CONTINUES TO ACCELERATE.  OPEN SOURCE

23

SOFTWARE, NEW COMPUTING DEVICES, NEW MICROPROCESSOR ARCHITECTURES, THE INTERNET,

AND WEB-BASED COMPUTING MODELS ARE AMONG THE COMPETITIVE CHALLENGES THE COMPANY

MUST MEET. IF MICROSOFT DOES NOT SUCCESSFULLY IDENTIFY NEW PRODUCT OPPORTUNITIES

AND DEVELOP AND BRING NEW PRODUCTS TO MARKET IN A TIMELY AND COST-EFFICIENT

MANNER, THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS GROWTH WILL SUFFER AND DEMAND FOR ITS PRODUCTS

WILL DECREASE.

FUTURE INITIATIVES

THE COMPANY PLANS TO CONTINUE TO MAKE SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS IN SOFTWARE

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT INCLUDING MICROSOFT .NET, "HAILSTORM", XBOX, WIRELESS

TECHNOLOGIES, DIGITAL DEVICES, TELEVISION, AND SMALL BUSINESS.  IT IS

ANTICIPATED THAT THESE INVESTMENTS IN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT WILL INCREASE

OVER HISTORICAL SPENDING LEVELS.  SIGNIFICANT REVENUE FROM THESE PRODUCT

OPPORTUNITIES MAY NOT BE ACHIEVED FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS, IF AT ALL.

PC GROWTH RATES

THE NATURE OF THE PC MARKETPLACE IS CHANGING IN WAYS THAT MAY REDUCE MICROSOFT'S

SOFTWARE SALES AND REVENUE GROWTH.  OVERALL MARKET DEMAND FOR PCS CAN

SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT MICROSOFT'S REVENUE GROWTH.  RECENTLY, MANUFACTURERS HAVE

SOUGHT TO REACH MORE CONSUMERS BY DEVELOPING AND PRODUCING LOWER COST PCS - PCS

THAT COME WITHOUT PRE-INSTALLED SOFTWARE OR CONTAIN SOFTWARE WITH REDUCED

FUNCTIONALITY.  IN ADDITION TO THE INFLUX OF LOW-COST PCS, A MARKET FOR HANDHELD

COMPUTING AND COMMUNICATION DEVICES HAS DEVELOPED.  WHILE THESE DEVICES ARE NOT

AS POWERFUL OR VERSATILE AS PCS, THEY THREATEN TO ERODE SALES GROWTH IN THE

MARKET FOR PCS WITH PRE-INSTALLED SOFTWARE.  THIS MAY AFFECT MICROSOFT'S REVENUE

GROWTH BECAUSE MANUFACTURERS MAY CHOOSE NOT TO INSTALL MICROSOFT SOFTWARE IN

THESE LOW-COST PCS OR CONSUMERS MAY PURCHASE ALTERNATIVE INTELLIGENT DEVICES

THAT DO NOT USE MICROSOFT SOFTWARE.  THESE LOWER-PRICED DEVICES REQUIRE

MICROSOFT TO PROVIDE LOWER-PRICED SOFTWARE WITH A SUBSET OF THE ORIGINAL

FUNCTIONALITY.  AS A RESULT, THE COMPANY MAY GENERATE LESS REVENUE FROM THE SALE

OF SOFTWARE PRODUCED FOR THESE DEVICES THAN FROM THE SALE OF SOFTWARE FOR PCS.

PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT

THE SOFTWARE INDUSTRY IS INHERENTLY COMPLEX.  NEW PRODUCTS AND PRODUCT

ENHANCEMENTS CAN REQUIRE LONG DEVELOPMENT AND TESTING PERIODS.  SIGNIFICANT

DELAYS IN NEW PRODUCT RELEASES OR SIGNIFICANT PROBLEMS IN CREATING NEW PRODUCTS

COULD DAMAGE MICROSOFT'S BUSINESS.  THE COMPANY ANTICIPATES THAT WINDOWS XP AND

XBOX WILL BE RELEASED IN FISCAL 2002.  DELAYS IN EITHER PRODUCT MAY ADVERSELY

AFFECT REVENUE AND NET INCOME.

PRICES

THE COMPETITIVE FACTORS DESCRIBED ABOVE MAY REQUIRE MICROSOFT TO LOWER PRODUCT

PRICES TO MEET COMPETITION, REDUCING THE COMPANY'S REVENUE AND NET INCOME.

EARNINGS PROCESS

AN INCREASINGLY HIGHER PERCENTAGE OF THE COMPANY'S REVENUE IS SUBJECT TO RATABLE

RECOGNITION, WHICH IMPACTS THE TIMING OF REVENUE AND EARNINGS RECOGNITION.

RATABLE REVENUE RECOGNITION MAY BE REQUIRED FOR ADDITIONAL PRODUCTS, DEPENDING

ON SPECIFIC LICENSE TERMS AND CONDITIONS.  ALSO, MAINTENANCE AND NEW

SUBSCRIPTION PROGRAMS ARE INCREASING IN POPULARITY.

EMPLOYEE COMPENSATION

MICROSOFT EMPLOYEES CURRENTLY RECEIVE SALARIES, INCENTIVE BONUSES, OTHER

BENEFITS, AND STOCK OPTIONS.  NEW GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS, POOR STOCK PRICE

PERFORMANCE, OR OTHER FACTORS COULD DIMINISH THE VALUE OF THE OPTION PROGRAM TO

CURRENT AND PROSPECTIVE EMPLOYEES AND REQUIRE THE COMPANY TO PAY HIGHER SALARIES

AND OTHER CASH COMPENSATION.

INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS

MICROSOFT DEVELOPS AND SELLS PRODUCTS THROUGHOUT THE WORLD.  THE PRICES OF THE

COMPANY'S PRODUCTS IN COUNTRIES OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES ARE GENERALLY

HIGHER THAN THE COMPANY'S PRICES IN THE UNITED STATES BECAUSE OF THE COST

INCURRED IN LOCALIZING SOFTWARE FOR NON-U.S. MARKETS.  THE COSTS OF PRODUCING

AND SELLING THE COMPANY'S PRODUCTS IN THESE COUNTRIES ARE ALSO HIGHER.  PRESSURE

TO GLOBALIZE MICROSOFT'S PRICING STRUCTURE MIGHT REQUIRE THAT THE COMPANY REDUCE

THE SALES PRICE OF ITS SOFTWARE IN OTHER COUNTRIES, EVEN THOUGH THE COSTS OF THE

SOFTWARE CONTINUE TO BE HIGHER THAN IN THE UNITED STATES.  UNFAVORABLE CHANGES

IN SOFTWARE "PIRACY" TRADE PROTECTION LAWS, POLICIES AND MEASURES, AND OTHER

REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS AFFECTING TRADE AND INVESTMENT; UNEXPECTED CHANGES IN

REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS FOR SOFTWARE; SOCIAL, POLITICAL, LABOR, OR ECONOMIC

CONDITIONS IN A SPECIFIC COUNTRY OR REGION; DIFFICULTIES IN STAFFING AND

MANAGING FOREIGN

24

OPERATIONS; AND POTENTIAL ADVERSE FOREIGN TAX CONSEQUENCES; AMONG OTHER FACTORS,

COULD ALSO HAVE AN IMPACT ON THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES.

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS

MICROSOFT DILIGENTLY DEFENDS ITS INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS, BUT UNLICENSED

COPYING OF SOFTWARE REPRESENTS A LOSS OF REVENUE TO THE COMPANY.  WHILE THIS

ADVERSELY AFFECTS U.S. REVENUE, REVENUE LOSS IS EVEN MORE SIGNIFICANT OUTSIDE OF

THE UNITED STATES, PARTICULARLY IN COUNTRIES WHERE LAWS ARE LESS PROTECTIVE OF

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS.  THROUGHOUT THE WORLD, MICROSOFT ACTIVELY EDUCATES

CONSUMERS ON THE BENEFITS OF LICENSING GENUINE PRODUCTS AND EDUCATES LAWMAKERS

ON THE ADVANTAGES OF A BUSINESS CLIMATE WHERE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS ARE

PROTECTED.  HOWEVER, CONTINUED EFFORTS MAY NOT AFFECT REVENUE POSITIVELY.

LITIGATION

LITIGATION REGARDING INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS, PATENTS, AND COPYRIGHTS

OCCURS IN THE SOFTWARE INDUSTRY.  IN ADDITION, THERE ARE GOVERNMENT REGULATION

AND INVESTIGATION RISKS ALONG WITH OTHER GENERAL CORPORATE LEGAL RISKS.  THE

COMPANY IS A DEFENDANT IN A LAWSUIT FILED BY THE ANTITRUST DIVISION OF THE U.S.

DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE AND A GROUP OF EIGHTEEN STATE ATTORNEYS GENERAL ALLEGING

VIOLATIONS OF THE SHERMAN ACT AND VARIOUS STATE ANTITRUST LAWS.  AFTER THE

TRIAL, THE DISTRICT COURT ENTERED FINDINGS OF FACT AND CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

STATING THAT MICROSOFT HAD VIOLATED SECTIONS 1 AND 2 OF THE SHERMAN ACT AND

VARIOUS STATE ANTITRUST LAWS.  A JUDGMENT WAS ENTERED ON JUNE 7, 2000 ORDERING,

AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE BREAKUP OF MICROSOFT INTO TWO COMPANIES.  THE JUDGMENT

WAS STAYED PENDING AN APPEAL.  ON JUNE 28, 2001, THE U.S. COURT OF APPEALS FOR

THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA CIRCUIT AFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART, AND VACATED

THE JUDGMENT IN ITS ENTIRETY AND REMANDED THE CASE TO THE DISTRICT COURT FOR A

NEW TRIAL ON ONE SECTION 1 CLAIM AND FOR ENTRY OF A NEW JUDGMENT CONSISTENT WITH

ITS RULING.  IN ITS RULING, THE COURT OF APPEALS SUBSTANTIALLY NARROWED THE

BASES OF LIABILITY FOUND BY THE DISTRICT COURT, BUT AFFIRMED SOME OF THE

DISTRICT COURT'S CONCLUSIONS THAT MICROSOFT HAD VIOLATED SECTION 2.  ON

SEPTEMBER 6, 2001, THE PLAINTIFFS ANNOUNCED THAT ON REMAND THEY WILL NOT ASK THE

COURT TO BREAK MICROSOFT UP, THAT THEY WILL SEEK IMPOSITION OF CONDUCT REMEDIES,

AND THAT THEY WILL NOT RETRY THE ONE SECTION 1 CLAIM RETURNED TO THE DISTRICT

COURT BY THE COURT OF APPEALS.  ON AUGUST 7, 2001, MICROSOFT PETITIONED THE

SUPREME COURT FOR A WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO REVIEW THE APPELLATE COURT'S RULING

CONCERNING ITS DISQUALIFICATION OF THE DISTRICT COURT JUDGE.  MICROSOFT MAY

PETITION THE SUPREME COURT TO REVIEW OTHER ASPECTS OF THE APPELLATE COURT'S

DECISION AFTER FINAL JUDGMENT IS ENTERED.  IN RESPONSE TO THE COURT OF APPEAL'S

DECISION, MICROSOFT HAS MODIFIED THE TERMS OF ITS AGREEMENTS WITH COMPUTER

MANUFACTURERS TO PERMIT THEM TO REMOVE INTERNET EXPLORER ICONS FROM WINDOWS WHEN

THE MANUFACTURER WANTS TO PROMOTE AN ALTERNATIVE BROWSER, AND MODIFYING OTHER

PROVISIONS OF THE AGREEMENTS.  WHILE THE COMPANY CANNOT PREDICT WITH CERTAINTY

THE FINAL OUTCOME OF THIS MATTER, ITS RESOLUTION MAY RESULT IN ADDITIONAL

CHANGES TO THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS PRACTICES AND COULD AFFECT HOW THE COMPANY

DEVELOPS AND MARKETS NEW PRODUCTS AND SERVICES.  IN ADDITION, WHILE THE COURT OF

APPEALS RULING VACATED THE REMEDIES PORTION OF THE JUDGMENT IN ITS ENTIRETY, IT

IS POSSIBLE THE DISTRICT COURT COULD ENTER A NEW JUDGMENT PROVIDING FOR CERTAIN

REMEDIES THAT WOULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANY IF THE COMPANY

CANNOT OBTAIN RELIEF FROM SUCH PROVISIONS ON APPEAL.

A LARGE NUMBER OF ANTITRUST CLASS ACTION LAWSUITS HAVE BEEN INITIATED AGAINST

MICROSOFT. THESE CASES ALLEGE THAT MICROSOFT HAS COMPETED UNFAIRLY AND

UNLAWFULLY MONOPOLIZED ALLEGED MARKETS FOR OPERATING SYSTEMS AND CERTAIN

SOFTWARE APPLICATIONS AND SEEK TO RECOVER ALLEGED OVERCHARGES THAT THE

COMPLAINTS CONTEND MICROSOFT CHARGED FOR THESE PRODUCTS. ALTHOUGH MICROSOFT

BELIEVES THE CLAIMS ARE WITHOUT MERIT AND IS VIGOROUSLY DEFENDING THE CASES, THE

COMPANY CANNOT PREDICT WITH CERTAINTY THE OUTCOME OF THESE LAWSUITS.

FUTURE GROWTH RATE

THE REVENUE GROWTH RATE IN 2002 MAY NOT APPROACH THE LEVEL ATTAINED IN PRIOR

YEARS. BECAUSE OF THE FIXED NATURE OF A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OPERATING

EXPENSES, COUPLED WITH THE POSSIBILITY OF SLOWER REVENUE GROWTH, OPERATING

MARGINS IN 2002 MAY DECREASE FROM THOSE IN 2001. IN ADDITION, WITH THE

ANTICIPATED INTRODUCTION OF XBOX IN FISCAL 2002, COST OF REVENUE AS A PERCENTAGE

OF REVENUE MAY INCREASE VERSUS PRIOR YEARS.

ITEM 7A.  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

THE COMPANY IS EXPOSED TO FOREIGN CURRENCY, INTEREST RATE, AND SECURITIES PRICE

RISKS.  A PORTION OF THESE RISKS IS HEDGED, BUT FLUCTUATIONS COULD IMPACT THE

COMPANY'S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL POSITION.

25

THE COMPANY HEDGES THE EXPOSURE OF ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND A PORTION OF

ANTICIPATED REVENUE TO FOREIGN CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS, PRIMARILY WITH OPTION

CONTRACTS. THE COMPANY MONITORS ITS FOREIGN CURRENCY EXPOSURES DAILY TO MAXIMIZE

THE OVERALL EFFECTIVENESS OF ITS FOREIGN CURRENCY HEDGE POSITIONS. PRINCIPAL

CURRENCIES HEDGED INCLUDE THE EURO, JAPANESE YEN, BRITISH POUND, AND CANADIAN

DOLLAR. FIXED INCOME SECURITIES ARE SUBJECT TO INTEREST RATE RISK. THE PORTFOLIO

IS DIVERSIFIED AND CONSISTS PRIMARILY OF INVESTMENT GRADE SECURITIES TO MINIMIZE

CREDIT RISK. THE COMPANY ROUTINELY USES OPTIONS TO HEDGE ITS EXPOSURE TO

INTEREST RATE RISK IN THE EVENT OF A CATASTROPHIC INCREASE IN INTEREST RATES.

MANY SECURITIES HELD IN THE COMPANY'S EQUITY AND OTHER INVESTMENTS PORTFOLIO ARE

SUBJECT TO PRICE RISK. THE COMPANY USES OPTIONS TO HEDGE ITS PRICE RISK ON

CERTAIN HIGHLY VOLATILE EQUITY SECURITIES.

THE COMPANY USES A VALUE-AT-RISK (VAR) MODEL TO ESTIMATE AND QUANTIFY ITS MARKET

RISKS.  THE VAR MODEL IS NOT INTENDED TO REPRESENT ACTUAL LOSSES IN FAIR VALUE,

BUT IS USED AS A RISK ESTIMATION AND MANAGEMENT TOOL.  ASSUMPTIONS APPLIED TO

THE VAR MODEL AT JUNE 30, 2000 AND JUNE 30, 2001 INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING: NORMAL

MARKET CONDITIONS; MONTE CARLO MODELING WITH 10,000 SIMULATED MARKET PRICE

PATHS; A 97.5% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL; AND A 20-DAY ESTIMATED LOSS IN FAIR VALUE

FOR EACH MARKET RISK CATEGORY.  ACCORDINGLY, 97.5% OF THE TIME THE ESTIMATED 20-

DAY LOSS IN FAIR VALUE WOULD BE NOMINAL FOR FOREIGN CURRENCY DENOMINATED

INVESTMENTS AND ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AT JUNE 30, 2000 AND JUNE 30, 2001, AND

WOULD NOT EXCEED $211 MILLION AND $363 MILLION AT JUNE 30, 2000 AND JUNE 30,

2001 FOR INTEREST-SENSITIVE INVESTMENTS OR $1.02 BILLION AND $520 MILLION AT

JUNE 30, 2000 AND JUNE 30, 2001 FOR EQUITY SECURITIES.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

ACCOUNTING POLICIES

ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES

THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND ACCOMPANYING NOTES ARE PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH

GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES IN THE UNITED STATES.

PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION

THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDE THE ACCOUNTS OF MICROSOFT AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES.

INTERCOMPANY TRANSACTIONS AND BALANCES HAVE BEEN ELIMINATED.  EQUITY INVESTMENTS

IN WHICH MICROSOFT OWNS AT LEAST 20% OF THE VOTING SECURITIES ARE ACCOUNTED FOR

USING THE EQUITY METHOD, EXCEPT FOR INVESTMENTS IN WHICH THE COMPANY IS NOT ABLE

TO EXERCISE SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE OVER THE INVESTEE, IN WHICH CASE, THE COST

METHOD OF ACCOUNTING IS USED.  ISSUANCES OF SHARES BY A SUBSIDIARY ARE ACCOUNTED

FOR AS CAPITAL TRANSACTIONS.

ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS

PREPARING FINANCIAL STATEMENTS REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND

ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS, LIABILITIES, REVENUE,

AND EXPENSES.  EXAMPLES INCLUDE PROVISIONS FOR RETURNS, CONCESSIONS AND BAD

DEBTS; AND THE LENGTH OF PRODUCT LIFE CYCLES AND BUILDINGS' LIVES.  ACTUAL

RESULTS MAY DIFFER FROM THESE ESTIMATES.

FOREIGN CURRENCIES

ASSETS AND LIABILITIES RECORDED IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES ARE TRANSLATED AT THE

EXCHANGE RATE ON THE BALANCE SHEET DATE.  TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENTS RESULTING FROM

THIS PROCESS ARE CHARGED OR CREDITED TO OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME.  REVENUE AND

EXPENSES ARE TRANSLATED AT AVERAGE RATES OF EXCHANGE PREVAILING DURING THE YEAR.

REVENUE RECOGNITION

REVENUE FROM PRODUCTS LICENSED TO ORIGINAL EQUIPMENT MANUFACTURERS IS RECORDED

WHEN OEMS SHIP LICENSED PRODUCTS WHILE REVENUE FROM CERTAIN LICENSE PROGRAMS IS

RECORDED WHEN THE SOFTWARE HAS BEEN DELIVERED AND THE CUSTOMER IS INVOICED.

REVENUE FROM PACKAGED PRODUCT SALES TO AND THROUGH DISTRIBUTORS AND RESELLERS IS

RECORDED WHEN RELATED PRODUCTS ARE SHIPPED.  MAINTENANCE AND SUBSCRIPTION

REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED RATABLY OVER THE CONTRACT PERIOD.  REVENUE ATTRIBUTABLE TO

UNDELIVERED ELEMENTS, INCLUDING TECHNICAL SUPPORT AND INTERNET BROWSER

TECHNOLOGIES, IS BASED ON THE AVERAGE SALES PRICE OF THOSE ELEMENTS AND IS

RECOGNIZED RATABLY ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THE PRODUCT'S LIFE CYCLE.  WHEN

THE REVENUE RECOGNITION CRITERIA REQUIRED FOR DISTRIBUTOR AND RESELLER

ARRANGEMENTS ARE NOT MET, REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED AS PAYMENTS ARE RECEIVED.  COSTS

RELATED TO INSIGNIFICANT OBLIGATIONS, WHICH INCLUDE TELEPHONE SUPPORT FOR

CERTAIN PRODUCTS, ARE ACCRUED.  PROVISIONS ARE RECORDED FOR RETURNS,

CONCESSIONS, AND BAD DEBTS.

COST OF REVENUE

COST OF REVENUE INCLUDES DIRECT COSTS TO PRODUCE AND DISTRIBUTE PRODUCT AND

DIRECT COSTS TO PROVIDE ONLINE SERVICES, CONSULTING, PRODUCT SUPPORT, AND

TRAINING AND CERTIFICATION OF SYSTEM INTEGRATORS.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS ARE EXPENSED AS INCURRED.  STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL

ACCOUNTING STANDARDS (SFAS) 86, ACCOUNTING FOR THE COSTS OF COMPUTER SOFTWARE TO

BE SOLD, LEASED, OR OTHERWISE MARKETED, DOES NOT MATERIALLY AFFECT THE COMPANY.

ADVERTISING COSTS

ADVERTISING COSTS ARE EXPENSED AS INCURRED.  ADVERTISING EXPENSE WAS $804

MILLION IN 1999, $1.23 BILLION IN 2000, AND $1.36 BILLION IN 2001.

INCOME TAXES

INCOME TAX EXPENSE INCLUDES U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL INCOME TAXES, PLUS THE

PROVISION FOR U.S. TAXES ON UNDISTRIBUTED EARNINGS OF INTERNATIONAL

SUBSIDIARIES.  CERTAIN ITEMS OF INCOME AND EXPENSE ARE NOT REPORTED IN TAX

RETURNS AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN THE SAME YEAR.  THE TAX EFFECT OF THIS

DIFFERENCE IS REPORTED AS DEFERRED INCOME TAXES.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

THE COMPANY CONSIDERS ALL LIQUID INTEREST-EARNING INVESTMENTS WITH A MATURITY OF

THREE MONTHS OR LESS AT THE DATE OF PURCHASE TO BE CASH EQUIVALENTS.  SHORT-TERM

INVESTMENTS GENERALLY MATURE BETWEEN THREE MONTHS AND SIX YEARS FROM THE

PURCHASE DATE.  ALL CASH AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS ARE CLASSIFIED AS AVAILABLE

FOR SALE AND ARE RECORDED AT MARKET VALUE USING THE SPECIFIC IDENTIFICATION

METHOD; UNREALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES ARE REFLECTED IN OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME

(OCI).

31

EQUITY AND OTHER INVESTMENTS INCLUDE DEBT AND EQUITY INSTRUMENTS.  DEBT

SECURITIES AND PUBLICLY TRADED EQUITY SECURITIES ARE CLASSIFIED AS AVAILABLE FOR

SALE AND ARE RECORDED AT MARKET USING THE SPECIFIC IDENTIFICATION METHOD.

UNREALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES (EXCLUDING OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY LOSSES) ARE

REFLECTED IN OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME.  ALL OTHER INVESTMENTS, EXCLUDING THOSE

ACCOUNTED FOR USING THE EQUITY METHOD, ARE RECORDED AT COST.

MICROSOFT LENDS CERTAIN FIXED INCOME AND EQUITY SECURITIES TO ENHANCE INVESTMENT

INCOME.  COLLATERAL AND/OR SECURITY INTEREST IS DETERMINED BASED UPON THE

UNDERLYING SECURITY AND THE CREDITWORTHINESS OF THE BORROWER.  THE FAIR VALUE OF

COLLATERAL THAT MICROSOFT IS PERMITTED TO SELL OR REPLEDGE WAS $499 MILLION AT

JUNE 30, 2001.  THERE WAS NO COLLATERAL THAT MICROSOFT WAS PERMITTED TO SELL OR

REPLEDGE AT JUNE 30, 2000.

INVESTMENTS ARE CONSIDERED TO BE IMPAIRED WHEN A DECLINE IN FAIR VALUE IS JUDGED

TO BE OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY.  THE COMPANY EMPLOYS A SYSTEMATIC METHODOLOGY THAT

CONSIDERS AVAILABLE EVIDENCE IN EVALUATING POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT OF ITS

INVESTMENTS.  IN THE EVENT THAT THE COST OF AN INVESTMENT EXCEEDS ITS FAIR

VALUE, THE COMPANY EVALUATES, AMONG OTHER FACTORS, THE DURATION AND EXTENT TO

WHICH THE FAIR VALUE IS LESS THAN COST; THE FINANCIAL HEALTH OF AND BUSINESS

OUTLOOK FOR THE INVESTEE, INCLUDING INDUSTRY AND SECTOR PERFORMANCE, CHANGES IN

TECHNOLOGY, AND OPERATIONAL AND FINANCING CASH FLOW FACTORS; AND THE COMPANY'S

INTENT AND ABILITY TO HOLD THE INVESTMENT.  ONCE A DECLINE IN FAIR VALUE IS

DETERMINED TO BE OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY, AN IMPAIRMENT CHARGE IS RECORDED AND A

NEW COST BASIS IN THE INVESTMENT IS ESTABLISHED.  IN 2001, THE COMPANY

RECOGNIZED $4.80 BILLION IN IMPAIRMENTS OF CERTAIN INVESTMENTS, PRIMARILY IN THE

CABLE AND TELECOMMUNICATION INDUSTRIES.

THE COMPANY USES DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS TO MANAGE EXPOSURES TO FOREIGN CURRENCY,

SECURITY PRICE, AND INTEREST RATE RISKS.  THE COMPANY'S OBJECTIVES FOR HOLDING

DERIVATIVES ARE TO MINIMIZE THESE RISKS USING THE MOST EFFECTIVE METHODS TO

ELIMINATE OR REDUCE THE IMPACT OF THESE EXPOSURES.

FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK

---------------------

CERTAIN FORECASTED TRANSACTIONS AND ASSETS ARE EXPOSED TO FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK.

THE COMPANY MONITORS ITS FOREIGN CURRENCY EXPOSURES DAILY TO MAXIMIZE THE

OVERALL EFFECTIVENESS OF ITS FOREIGN CURRENCY HEDGE POSITIONS.  PRINCIPAL

CURRENCIES HEDGED INCLUDE THE EURO, JAPANESE YEN, BRITISH POUND, AND CANADIAN

DOLLAR.  OPTIONS USED TO HEDGE A PORTION OF FORECASTED INTERNATIONAL REVENUE FOR

UP TO THREE YEARS IN THE FUTURE ARE DESIGNATED AS CASH FLOW HEDGING INSTRUMENTS.

OPTIONS AND FORWARDS NOT DESIGNATED AS HEDGING INSTRUMENTS UNDER SFAS 133 ARE

ALSO USED TO HEDGE THE IMPACT OF THE VARIABILITY IN EXCHANGE RATES ON ACCOUNTS

RECEIVABLE AND COLLECTIONS DENOMINATED IN CERTAIN FOREIGN CURRENCIES.

SECURITIES PRICE RISK

---------------------

STRATEGIC EQUITY INVESTMENTS ARE SUBJECT TO MARKET PRICE RISK.  FROM TIME TO

TIME, THE COMPANY USES AND DESIGNATES OPTIONS TO HEDGE FAIR VALUES AND CASH

FLOWS ON CERTAIN EQUITY SECURITIES.  THE SECURITY, OR FORECASTED SALE THEREOF,

SELECTED FOR HEDGING IS DETERMINED BY MARKET CONDITIONS, UP-FRONT COSTS, AND

OTHER RELEVANT FACTORS.  ONCE ESTABLISHED, THE HEDGES ARE NOT DYNAMICALLY

MANAGED OR TRADED, AND ARE GENERALLY NOT REMOVED UNTIL MATURITY.

INTEREST RATE RISK

------------------

FIXED-INCOME SECURITIES ARE SUBJECT TO INTEREST RATE RISK.  THE FIXED-INCOME

PORTFOLIO IS DIVERSIFIED AND CONSISTS PRIMARILY OF INVESTMENT GRADE SECURITIES

TO MINIMIZE CREDIT RISK.  THE COMPANY ROUTINELY USES OPTIONS, NOT DESIGNATED AS

HEDGING INSTRUMENTS, TO HEDGE ITS EXPOSURE TO INTEREST RATE RISK IN THE EVENT OF

A CATASTROPHIC INCREASE IN INTEREST RATES.

OTHER DERIVATIVES

-----------------

IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY MAY INVEST IN WARRANTS TO PURCHASE SECURITIES OF OTHER

COMPANIES AS A STRATEGIC INVESTMENT.  WARRANTS THAT CAN BE NET SHARE SETTLED ARE

DEEMED DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND ARE NOT DESIGNATED AS HEDGING

INSTRUMENTS.

FOR OPTIONS DESIGNATED EITHER AS FAIR VALUE OR CASH FLOW HEDGES, CHANGES IN THE

TIME VALUE ARE EXCLUDED FROM THE ASSESSMENT OF HEDGE EFFECTIVENESS.

32

PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT

PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT IS STATED AT COST AND DEPRECIATED USING THE STRAIGHT-LINE

METHOD OVER THE SHORTER OF THE ESTIMATED LIFE OF THE ASSET OR THE LEASE TERM,

RANGING FROM ONE TO 15 YEARS.  COMPUTER SOFTWARE DEVELOPED OR OBTAINED FOR

INTERNAL USE IS DEPRECIATED USING THE STRAIGHT-LINE METHOD OVER THE SHORTER OF

THE ESTIMATED LIFE OF THE SOFTWARE OR THREE YEARS.

INTANGIBLE ASSETS

GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS ARE AMORTIZED USING THE STRAIGHT-LINE

METHOD OVER THEIR ESTIMATED PERIOD OF BENEFIT, RANGING FROM THREE TO SEVEN

YEARS.  THE COMPANY PERIODICALLY EVALUATES THE RECOVERABILITY OF INTANGIBLE

ASSETS AND TAKES INTO ACCOUNT EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES THAT WARRANT REVISED

ESTIMATES OF USEFUL LIVES OR THAT INDICATE THAT AN IMPAIRMENT EXISTS.

IN JUNE 2001, THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD ISSUED STATEMENT OF

FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS (SFAS) 141, BUSINESS COMBINATIONS, AND SFAS 142,

GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS.  SFAS 141 REQUIRES BUSINESS COMBINATIONS

INITIATED AFTER JUNE 30, 2001 TO BE ACCOUNTED FOR USING THE PURCHASE METHOD OF

ACCOUNTING.  IT ALSO SPECIFIES THE TYPES OF ACQUIRED INTANGIBLE ASSETS THAT ARE

REQUIRED TO BE RECOGNIZED AND REPORTED SEPARATELY FROM GOODWILL.  SFAS 142 WILL

REQUIRE THAT GOODWILL AND CERTAIN INTANGIBLES NO LONGER BE AMORTIZED, BUT

INSTEAD TESTED FOR IMPAIRMENT AT LEAST ANNUALLY.  SFAS 142 IS REQUIRED TO BE

APPLIED STARTING WITH FISCAL YEARS BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2001, WITH EARLY

APPLICATION PERMITTED IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES.  THE COMPANY PLANS TO EARLY

ADOPT SFAS 142 IN FISCAL 2002 AND DOES NOT EXPECT ANY IMPAIRMENT OF GOODWILL

UPON ADOPTION.  GOODWILL AMORTIZATION WAS APPROXIMATELY $300 MILLION IN FISCAL

2001 AND APPROXIMATELY $225 MILLION IN FISCAL 2000.

RECLASSIFICATIONS

CERTAIN RECLASSIFICATIONS HAVE BEEN MADE FOR CONSISTENT PRESENTATION.

ACCOUNTING CHANGE

EFFECTIVE JULY 1, 2000, THE COMPANY ADOPTED SFAS 133, ACCOUNTING FOR DERIVATIVE

INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES, WHICH ESTABLISHES ACCOUNTING AND REPORTING

STANDARDS FOR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS, INCLUDING CERTAIN DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS

EMBEDDED IN OTHER CONTRACTS AND FOR HEDGING ACTIVITIES.  ALL DERIVATIVES,

WHETHER DESIGNATED IN HEDGING RELATIONSHIPS OR NOT, ARE REQUIRED TO BE RECORDED

ON THE BALANCE SHEET AT FAIR VALUE.  IF THE DERIVATIVE IS DESIGNATED AS A FAIR

VALUE HEDGE, THE CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE DERIVATIVE AND OF THE HEDGED

ITEM ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE HEDGED RISK ARE RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS.  IF THE

DERIVATIVE IS DESIGNATED AS A CASH FLOW HEDGE, THE EFFECTIVE PORTIONS OF CHANGES

IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE DERIVATIVE ARE RECORDED IN OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME

AND ARE RECOGNIZED IN THE INCOME STATEMENT WHEN THE HEDGED ITEM AFFECTS

EARNINGS.  INEFFECTIVE PORTIONS OF CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF CASH FLOW HEDGES

ARE RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS.

THE ADOPTION OF SFAS 133 ON JULY 1, 2000, RESULTED IN A CUMULATIVE PRE-TAX

REDUCTION TO INCOME OF $560 MILLION ($375 MILLION AFTER-TAX) AND A CUMULATIVE

PRE-TAX REDUCTION TO OCI OF $112 MILLION ($75 MILLION AFTER-TAX).  THE REDUCTION

TO INCOME WAS MOSTLY ATTRIBUTABLE TO A LOSS OF APPROXIMATELY $300 MILLION

RECLASSIFIED FROM OCI FOR THE TIME VALUE OF OPTIONS AND A LOSS OF APPROXIMATELY

$250 MILLION RECLASSIFIED FROM OCI FOR DERIVATIVES NOT DESIGNATED AS HEDGING

INSTRUMENTS.  THE REDUCTION TO OCI WAS MOSTLY ATTRIBUTABLE TO LOSSES OF

APPROXIMATELY $670 MILLION ON CASH FLOW HEDGES OFFSET BY RECLASSIFICATIONS OUT

OF OCI OF THE APPROXIMATELY $300 MILLION LOSS FOR THE TIME VALUE OF OPTIONS AND

THE APPROXIMATELY $250 MILLION LOSS FOR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS NOT DESIGNATED AS

HEDGING INSTRUMENTS.  THE NET DERIVATIVE LOSSES INCLUDED IN OCI AS OF JULY 1,

2000 WERE RECLASSIFIED INTO EARNINGS DURING THE TWELVE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30,

2001.

THE CHANGE IN ACCOUNTING FROM THE ADOPTION OF SFAS 133 DID NOT MATERIALLY AFFECT

NET INCOME IN 2001.

UNEARNED REVENUE

A PORTION OF MICROSOFT'S REVENUE IS EARNED RATABLY OVER THE PRODUCT LIFE CYCLE

OR, IN THE CASE OF SUBSCRIPTIONS, OVER THE PERIOD OF THE LICENSE AGREEMENT.

END USERS RECEIVE CERTAIN ELEMENTS OF THE COMPANY'S PRODUCTS OVER A PERIOD OF

TIME.  THESE ELEMENTS INCLUDE ITEMS SUCH AS BROWSER TECHNOLOGIES AND TECHNICAL

SUPPORT.  CONSEQUENTLY, MICROSOFT'S EARNED REVENUE REFLECTS THE RECOGNITION OF

THE FAIR VALUE OF THESE ELEMENTS OVER THE PRODUCT'S LIFE CYCLE.  UPON ADOPTION

OF AMERICAN INSTITUTE OF CERTIFIED PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS (AICPA) STATEMENT OF

POSITION (SOP) 98-9, MODIFICATION OF SOP 97-2, WITH RESPECT TO

33

CERTAIN TRANSACTIONS, DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF FISCAL 1999, THE COMPANY WAS

REQUIRED TO CHANGE THE METHODOLOGY OF ATTRIBUTING THE FAIR VALUE TO UNDELIVERED

ELEMENTS. THE PERCENTAGES OF UNDELIVERED ELEMENTS IN RELATION TO THE TOTAL

ARRANGEMENT DECREASED, REDUCING THE AMOUNT OF WINDOWS AND OFFICE REVENUE TREATED

AS UNEARNED, AND INCREASING THE AMOUNT OF REVENUE RECOGNIZED UPON SHIPMENT. THE

PERCENTAGE OF REVENUE RECOGNIZED RATABLY DECREASED FROM A RANGE OF 20% TO 35% TO

A RANGE OF APPROXIMATELY 15% TO 25% OF WINDOWS DESKTOP OPERATING SYSTEMS. FOR

DESKTOP APPLICATIONS, THE PERCENTAGE DECREASED FROM APPROXIMATELY 20% TO A RANGE

OF APPROXIMATELY 10% TO 20%. THE RANGES DEPEND ON THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF

THE LICENSE AND PRICES OF THE ELEMENTS. IN ADDITION, IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF

FISCAL 1999, THE COMPANY EXTENDED THE LIFE CYCLE OF WINDOWS FROM TWO TO THREE

YEARS BASED UPON MANAGEMENT'S REVIEW OF PRODUCT SHIPMENT CYCLES. PRODUCT LIFE

CYCLES ARE CURRENTLY ESTIMATED AT 18 MONTHS FOR DESKTOP APPLICATIONS. THE

COMPANY ALSO SELLS SUBSCRIPTIONS TO CERTAIN PRODUCTS VIA MAINTENANCE AND CERTAIN

ORGANIZATIONAL LICENSE AGREEMENTS.

AT JUNE 30, 2000 AND 2001, DESKTOP APPLICATIONS UNEARNED REVENUE WAS $1.84

BILLION AND $2.19 BILLION.  DESKTOP PLATFORMS UNEARNED REVENUE WAS $2.34 BILLION

AND $2.59 BILLION.  ENTERPRISE SOFTWARE AND SERVICES UNEARNED REVENUE WAS $433

MILLION AND $413 MILLION.  UNEARNED REVENUE ASSOCIATED WITH CONSUMER SOFTWARE,

SERVICES, AND DEVICES, AND OTHER WAS $200 MILLION AND $427 MILLION AT JUNE 30,

2000 AND 2001.

SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT.  UNDER THE TERMS OF THE PUBLIC AGREEMENT, THE PARTIES

AGREED TO A DISMISSAL WITH PREJUDICE OF ALL PENDING CLAIMS IN THE SUIT BROUGHT

BY SUN AGAINST MICROSOFT ON OCTOBER 7, 1997 IN THE U.S. DISTRICT COURT FOR THE

NORTHERN DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA.  SUN ALSO GRANTED TO MICROSOFT A NON-EXCLUSIVE

LICENSE TO CONTINUE DISTRIBUTION OF CERTAIN SUN TECHNOLOGY FOR A SEVEN YEAR

PERIOD.  MICROSOFT FURTHER AGREED TO PAY SUN $20 MILLION.

THE COMPANY IS A DEFENDANT IN U.S. V. MICROSOFT, A LAWSUIT FILED BY THE

ANTITRUST DIVISION OF THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE (DOJ) AND A GROUP OF

EIGHTEEN STATE ATTORNEYS GENERAL ALLEGING VIOLATIONS OF THE SHERMAN ACT AND

VARIOUS STATE ANTITRUST LAWS.  AFTER THE TRIAL, THE DISTRICT COURT ENTERED

FINDINGS OF FACT AND CONCLUSIONS OF LAW STATING THAT MICROSOFT HAD VIOLATED

SECTIONS 1 AND 2 OF THE SHERMAN ACT AND VARIOUS STATE ANTITRUST LAWS.  A

JUDGMENT WAS ENTERED ON JUNE 7, 2000 ORDERING, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE BREAKUP

OF MICROSOFT INTO TWO COMPANIES.  THE JUDGMENT WAS STAYED PENDING AN APPEAL.  ON

JUNE 28, 2001, THE U.S. COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA CIRCUIT

AFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART, AND VACATED THE JUDGMENT IN ITS ENTIRETY AND

REMANDED THE CASE TO THE DISTRICT COURT FOR A NEW TRIAL ON ONE SECTION 1 CLAIM

AND FOR ENTRY OF A NEW JUDGMENT CONSISTENT WITH ITS RULING.  IN ITS RULING, THE

COURT OF APPEALS SUBSTANTIALLY NARROWED THE BASES OF LIABILITY FOUND BY THE

DISTRICT COURT, BUT AFFIRMED SOME OF THE DISTRICT COURT'S CONCLUSIONS THAT

MICROSOFT HAD VIOLATED SECTION 2.  ON SEPTEMBER 6, 2001, THE PLAINTIFFS

ANNOUNCED THAT ON REMAND THEY WILL NOT ASK THE COURT TO BREAK MICROSOFT UP, THAT

THEY WILL SEEK IMPOSITION OF CONDUCT REMEDIES, AND THAT THEY WILL NOT RETRY THE

ONE SECTION 1 CLAIM RETURNED TO THE DISTRICT COURT BY THE COURT OF APPEALS.  ON

AUGUST 7, 2001, MICROSOFT PETITIONED THE SUPREME COURT FOR A WRIT OF CERTIORARI

TO REVIEW THE APPELLATE COURT'S RULING CONCERNING ITS DISQUALIFICATION OF THE

DISTRICT COURT JUDGE.  MICROSOFT MAY PETITION THE SUPREME COURT TO REVIEW OTHER

ASPECTS OF THE APPELLATE COURT'S DECISION AFTER FINAL JUDGMENT IS ENTERED.

IN OTHER ONGOING INVESTIGATIONS, THE DOJ AND SEVERAL STATE ATTORNEYS GENERAL

HAVE REQUESTED INFORMATION FROM MICROSOFT CONCERNING VARIOUS ISSUES. IN

ADDITION, THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION HAS INSTITUTED PROCEEDINGS IN WHICH IT ALLEGES

THAT MICROSOFT HAS FAILED TO DISCLOSE INFORMATION THAT MICROSOFT COMPETITORS

CLAIM THEY NEED TO INTEROPERATE FULLY WITH WINDOWS 2000 CLIENTS AND SERVERS AND

HAS ENGAGED IN DISCRIMINATORY LICENSING OF SUCH TECHNOLOGY. THE REMEDIES SOUGHT,

THOUGH NOT FULLY DEFINED, INCLUDE MANDATORY DISCLOSURE OF MICROSOFT WINDOWS

OPERATING SYSTEM TECHNOLOGY AND IMPOSITION OF FINES. MICROSOFT DENIES THE

EUROPEAN COMMISSION'S ALLEGATIONS AND INTENDS TO CONTEST THE PROCEEDINGS

VIGOROUSLY.

A LARGE NUMBER OF OVERCHARGE CLASS ACTION LAWSUITS HAVE BEEN INITIATED AGAINST

MICROSOFT.  THESE CASES ALLEGE THAT MICROSOFT HAS COMPETED UNFAIRLY AND

UNLAWFULLY MONOPOLIZED ALLEGED MARKETS FOR OPERATING SYSTEMS AND CERTAIN

SOFTWARE APPLICATIONS AND SEEK TO RECOVER ALLEGED OVERCHARGES THAT THE

COMPLAINTS CONTEND MICROSOFT CHARGED FOR THESE PRODUCTS.  MICROSOFT BELIEVES THE

CLAIMS ARE WITHOUT MERIT AND IS VIGOROUSLY DEFENDING THE CASES.  TO DATE,

MICROSOFT HAS WON DISMISSALS OF ALL CLAIMS FOR DAMAGES BY INDIRECT PURCHASERS

UNDER FEDERAL LAW AND IN 15 SEPARATE STATE COURT PROCEEDINGS.  CLAIMS ON BEHALF

OF FOREIGN PURCHASERS HAVE ALSO BEEN DISMISSED.  PLAINTIFFS HAVE APPEALED MOST

OF THESE RULINGS.  WHILE NO TRIALS OR OTHER PROCEEDINGS HAVE BEEN HELD

CONCERNING ANY LIABILITY ISSUES, COURTS IN SEVERAL STATES HAVE RULED THAT THESE

CASES MAY PROCEED AS CLASS ACTIONS, WHILE ONE COURT HAS DENIED CLASS

CERTIFICATION STATUS TO THE CLAIMS IN THAT STATE PROCEEDING.

TWO PURPORTED CLASS ACTION EMPLOYMENT DISCRIMINATION CASES ARE PENDING AGAINST

MICROSOFT, DONALDSON V. MICROSOFT, A CLASS CASE CONSOLIDATING THREE SEPARATELY

FILED CLASS ACTION COMPLAINTS FILED IN OCTOBER 2000 AND FEBRUARY 2001 IN FEDERAL

COURT IN SEATTLE, WASHINGTON, AND JACKSON V. MICROSOFT, AN AMENDMENT TO AN

EXISTING CASE ALLEGING CLASS CLAIMS FILED ON JANUARY 3, 2001 IN FEDERAL COURT IN

WASHINGTON, D.C.  MICROSOFT'S MOTION TO TRANSFER THE JACKSON CASE TO FEDERAL

COURT IN SEATTLE WAS GRANTED ON MAY 3, 2001.  THE DONALDSON PLAINTIFFS PURPORT

TO REPRESENT A NATIONWIDE CLASS OF CURRENT AND FORMER AFRICAN AMERICAN AND

FEMALE MICROSOFT EMPLOYEES AND SEEK INJUNCTIVE RELIEF, AN UNSPECIFIED AMOUNT OF

COMPENSATORY AND PUNITIVE DAMAGES, AND ATTORNEYS' FEES.  THE JACKSON PLAINTIFFS

PURPORT TO REPRESENT A NATIONWIDE CLASS OF CURRENT AND FORMER AFRICAN AMERICAN

MICROSOFT EMPLOYEES AND SEEKS INJUNCTIVE RELIEF, $5 BILLION IN COMPENSATORY AND

PUNITIVE DAMAGES, AND ATTORNEYS' FEES.  BOTH CASES ALLEGE THAT MICROSOFT'S

COMPENSATION, EVALUATION, AND PROMOTION POLICIES ARE DISCRIMINATORY WITH RESPECT

TO THE PLAINTIFFS IN VIOLATION OF TITLE VII OF THE 1964 CIVIL RIGHTS ACT AND 42

U.S.C. (S) 1981.  MICROSOFT DENIES THE ALLEGATIONS AND IS VIGOROUSLY DEFENDING

BOTH CASES.

42

THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION IS CONDUCTING A NON-PUBLIC INVESTIGATION

INTO THE COMPANY'S ACCOUNTING RESERVE PRACTICES.  MICROSOFT IS ALSO SUBJECT TO

VARIOUS LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND CLAIMS THAT ARISE IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF

BUSINESS.

MANAGEMENT CURRENTLY BELIEVES THAT RESOLVING THESE MATTERS WILL NOT HAVE A

MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL POSITION OR ITS RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS.
