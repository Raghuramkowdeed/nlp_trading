GENERAL

OVER THE LAST THREE DECADES, TECHNOLOGY HAS TRANSFORMED THE WAY

PEOPLE WORK, PLAY, AND COMMUNICATE. TODAY, PEOPLE ACCESS INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATE WITH INDIVIDUALS FROM AROUND THE WORLD IN AN INSTANT. GROUNDBREAKING TECHNOLOGIES HAVE OPENED THE DOOR TO INNOVATIONS IN EVERY FIELD OF HUMAN ENDEAVOR, DELIVERING

NEW OPPORTUNITY, CONVENIENCE, AND VALUE TO PEOPLES LIVES. SINCE OUR FOUNDING IN 1975, WE HAVE BEEN A LEADER IN THIS TRANSFORMATION. AS A REFLECTION OF THAT ROLE, AND TO HELP US FOCUS ON THE OPPORTUNITIES THAT LIE AHEAD WE HAVE ESTABLISHED A

NEW CORPORATE MISSION.

TO ENABLE PEOPLE AND BUSINESSES THROUGHOUT THE WORLD TO REALIZE THEIR FULL POTENTIAL.

PRODUCT SEGMENTS

OUR PRODUCT SEGMENTS

PROVIDE MANAGEMENT WITH A COMPREHENSIVE FINANCIAL VIEW OF OUR KEY BUSINESSES. THE SEGMENTS PROVIDE A FRAMEWORK FOR THE ALIGNMENT OF STRATEGIES AND OBJECTIVES ACROSS THE DEVELOPMENT, SALES, MARKETING, AND SERVICES ORGANIZATIONS, AND FOR THE TIMELY

AND RATIONAL ALLOCATION OF DEVELOPMENT, SALES, MARKETING, AND SERVICES RESOURCES WITHIN BUSINESSES. THE SEGMENTS ALSO HELP FOCUS STRATEGIC PLANNING EFFORTS ON KEY OBJECTIVES AND INITIATIVES ACROSS OUR BROAD BUSINESSES.

THE PRODUCT SEGMENTS ARE DESIGNED TO ALLOCATE RESOURCES INTERNALLY AND PROVIDE A FRAMEWORK TO DETERMINE MANAGEMENT RESPONSIBILITY. DUE TO OUR INTEGRATED BUSINESS

STRUCTURE, OPERATING COSTS INCLUDED IN ONE SEGMENT MAY BENEFIT OTHER SEGMENTS. THEREFORE, THESE SEGMENTS ARE NOT DESIGNED TO MEASURE OPERATING INCOME OR LOSS THAT IS DIRECTLY RELATED TO THE PRODUCTS INCLUDED IN EACH SEGMENT. INTER-SEGMENT COST

COMMISSIONS ARE ESTIMATED BY MANAGEMENT AND USED TO COMPENSATE OR CHARGE EACH SEGMENT FOR SUCH SHARED COSTS AND TO INCENT SHARED EFFORT. DUE TO OUR INTEGRATED BUSINESS STRUCTURE, SEGMENTS SHOULD NOT BE VIEWED AS DISCRETE OR EASILY SEPARABLE

BUSINESSES.

OUR SEVEN PRODUCT SEGMENTS ARE: CLIENT; SERVER AND TOOLS; INFORMATION WORKER; MICROSOFT BUSINESS SOLUTIONS; MSN; MOBILE AND EMBEDDED

DEVICES; AND HOME AND ENTERTAINMENT. SEE NOTE 18  SEGMENT INFORMATION OF THE NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR FINANCIAL INFORMATION REGARDING SEGMENT REPORTING.

CLIENT.

THE CLIENT SEGMENT HAS OVERALL RESPONSIBILITY FOR PRODUCT DELIVERY, ENGINEERING, AND TECHNICAL

ARCHITECTURE FOR THE MICROSOFT WINDOWS OPERATING SYSTEM AND NEW MEDIA TECHNOLOGY, AS WELL AS OUR RELATIONSHIPS WITH MANUFACTURERS OF PERSONAL COMPUTERS, INCLUDING MULTINATIONAL AND REGIONAL ORIGINAL EQUIPMENT MANUFACTURER (OEM) ACCOUNTS. THE SEGMENT

INCLUDES SALES AND MARKETING EXPENSES FOR THE WINDOWS CLIENT OPERATING SYSTEM AND PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS FOR THE WINDOWS PLATFORM.

THE CLIENT

SEGMENT INCLUDES WINDOWS XP AND OTHER STANDARD WINDOWS OPERATING SYSTEMS. WINDOWS XP EXTENDS THE PERSONAL COMPUTING EXPERIENCE BY UNITING PCS, DEVICES, AND SERVICES, WHILE ENHANCING RELIABILITY, SECURITY, AND PERFORMANCE. WITH EMERGING FORM FACTORS

SUCH AS THE TABLET PC AND MEDIA CENTER, AND WITH INVESTMENTS IN TECHNOLOGY SUCH AS WINDOWS MEDIA, WE BELIEVE THE WINDOWS PC CONTINUES TO EVOLVE WITH INNOVATIONS THAT ENABLE PEOPLE TO USE COMPUTERS IN MORE WAYS, IN MORE PLACES, AND MORE

OFTEN THAN EVER BEFORE.

WINDOWS XP HOME EDITION IS DESIGNED FOR INDIVIDUALS OR FAMILIES AND INCLUDES CAPABILITIES FOR DIGITAL PHOTO, MUSIC, VIDEO,

HOME NETWORKING, AND COMMUNICATIONS. WINDOWS XP PROFESSIONAL, DESIGNED FOR BUSINESS USERS AND PEOPLE WHO DEMAND THE MOST FROM THEIR COMPUTING EXPERIENCE, INCLUDES ALL THE FEATURES OF HOME EDITION, ALONG WITH ADVANCED SECURITY, PERFORMANCE,

MANAGEABILITY, AND MULTILINGUAL FEATURES TO HELP CUSTOMERS IMPROVE THEIR PRODUCTIVITY AND CONNECTIVITY. WINDOWS XP 64-BIT EDITION MEETS THE DEMANDS OF SPECIALIZED TECHNICAL WORKSTATION USERS.

THE NEXT GENERATION OF THE WINDOWS OPERATING SYSTEM, CODE-NAMED LONGHORN, IS CURRENTLY UNDER DEVELOPMENT. THIS DEVELOPMENT PHASE REPRESENTS A SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT

FOR THE CLIENT BUSINESS AND IS EXPECTED TO RESULT IN A PRODUCT THAT IS MORE MANAGEABLE AND DEPLOYABLE FOR BOTH OUR BUSINESS AND CONSUMER MARKETS. WHILE ALL FEATURES AND FUNCTIONS HAVE NOT BEEN FINALIZED, LONGHORN WILL INCLUDE SIGNIFICANT ADVANCES IN

SECURITY, DIGITAL MEDIA, USER INTERFACES, AND OTHER AREAS THAT ARE EXPECTED TO ENHANCE THE USER AND DEVELOPER EXPERIENCE. WE ARE TARGETING BROAD AVAILABILITY OF THIS OPERATING SYSTEM IN CALENDAR YEAR 2006. WE ARE ALSO DEVELOPING A WINDOWS STORAGE

SUBSYSTEM, WHICH WILL PROVIDE ADVANCED DATA ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT CAPABILITIES, THAT WE PLAN TO DELIVER SUBSEQUENT TO THE LONGHORN OPERATING SYSTEM INTRODUCTION.

SERVER AND TOOLS.

THE SERVER AND

TOOLS SEGMENT HAS OVERALL RESPONSIBILITY FOR INTEGRATED PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT AND MARKETING OF WINDOWS SERVER SYSTEM PRODUCTS, INCLUDING BUILDING AND MARKETING WINDOWS SERVER OPERATING SYSTEMS. WINDOWS SERVER SYSTEM IS INTEGRATED SERVER INFRASTRUCTURE

SOFTWARE THAT IS DESIGNED TO SUPPORT END-TO-END SOLUTIONS BUILT ON THE WINDOWS SERVER 2003 OPERATING SYSTEM. IN ADDITION, THE SEGMENT PROVIDES INFORMATION ABOUT THE EXTENDED MICROSOFT PLATFORM THROUGH A VARIETY OF CONTENT OFFERINGS, SUCH AS

WEB-BASED TRAINING FOR DEVELOPERS AND IT PROFESSIONALS. THROUGH THIS SEGMENT, WE OFFER A BROAD RANGE OF CONSULTING SERVICES FOR ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY REQUIREMENTS, INCLUDING CUSTOM SOLUTION SERVICES, ENTERPRISE APPLICATION PLANNING, ARCHITECTURE AND

DESIGN SERVICES, AND PROOF-OF-CONCEPT SERVICES. WE ALSO PROVIDE PRODUCT SUPPORT SERVICES TO CORPORATIONS AND OTHER LARGE CUSTOMERS. THE SERVER AND TOOLS SEGMENT ALSO INCLUDES: DEVELOPER TOOLS, TRAINING, AND CERTIFICATION; MICROSOFT PRESS; THE

ENTERPRISE AND PARTNER GROUP, WHICH IS RESPONSIBLE FOR SALES, PARTNER MANAGEMENT AND PARTNER PROGRAMS FOR THE ENTERPRISE BUSINESS; AND THE PUBLIC SECTOR SALES AND MARKETING ORGANIZATION.

PRODUCTS IN SERVER AND TOOLS PROVIDE A WIDE RANGE OF CAPABILITIES THAT INCLUDE MESSAGING AND COLLABORATION, DATABASE MANAGEMENT, E-COMMERCE, AND MOBILE INFORMATION

ACCESS. THESE PRODUCTS ARE DESIGNED TO WORK SEAMLESSLY WITH ONE ANOTHER AND WITH ADVANCEMENTS IN APPLICATIONS AND DEVELOPMENT TOOLS. THIS ARCHITECTURE IS DESIGNED TO HELP SIMPLIFY THE DESIGN, DEVELOPMENT, DEPLOYMENT, AND MANAGEMENT OF SOLUTIONS SO

THAT CUSTOMERS CAN FOCUS LESS ON INTEGRATING SYSTEMS AND TRAINING USERS, AND MORE ON ADDING STRATEGIC VALUE TO THEIR BUSINESSES. WINDOWS SERVER SYSTEM ALSO READILY INTEGRATES WITH CUSTOMERS EXISTING NON-MICROSOFT SYSTEMS, THROUGH SUPPORT FOR

OPEN STANDARDS SUCH AS HTTP AND XML, AND THROUGH NATIVE SUPPORT FOR XML-BASED WEB SERVICES.

WINDOWS SERVER DELIVERS A PLATFORM FOR POWERING CONNECTED

APPLICATIONS, NETWORKS, AND WEB SERVICES FROM THE WORK GROUP TO THE DATA CENTER. SQL SERVER IS A DATABASE-AND-ANALYSIS OFFERING FOR RAPIDLY DELIVERING THE NEXT GENERATION OF SCALABLE E-COMMERCE, LINE-OF-BUSINESS, AND DATA-WAREHOUSING SOLUTIONS.

EXCHANGE SERVER, A BUSINESS TOOL FOR E-MAIL COLLABORATION, ENABLES INFORMATION WORKERS TO GAIN ACCESS TO CRITICAL BUSINESS COMMUNICATIONS. SYSTEMS MANAGEMENT SERVER (SMS) PROVIDES A COMPREHENSIVE SOLUTION FOR CHANGE AND CONFIGURATION MANAGEMENT OF

INFORMATION SYSTEMS, WHICH WE BELIEVE ENABLES ORGANIZATIONS TO PROVIDE RELEVANT SOFTWARE AND UPDATES TO USERS QUICKLY AND COST-EFFECTIVELY. SMALL BUSINESS SERVER HELPS SMALL BUSINESSES DO MORE WITH A BUSINESS SERVER SOLUTION THAT INCLUDES MESSAGING

AND COLLABORATION, SECURITY-ENHANCED INTERNET ACCESS, PROTECTED DATA STORAGE, RELIABLE PRINTING, THE ABILITY TO RUN LINE-OF-BUSINESS APPLICATIONS, AND FAXING. BIZTALK SERVER IS DESIGNED TO HELP CUSTOMERS EFFICIENTLY AND EFFECTIVELY INTEGRATE

SYSTEMS, EMPLOYEES, AND TRADING PARTNERS THROUGH MANAGEABLE BUSINESS PROCESSES, ENABLING THEM TO AUTOMATE AND ORCHESTRATE INTERACTIONS IN A FLEXIBLE AND HIGHLY AUTOMATED MANNER. DEVELOPER TOOLS FOCUS ON COORDINATING THE OVERALL PROGRAMMING MODEL FOR

THE CLIENT AND SERVER, CREATING TOOLS FOR DEVELOPING MICROSOFT .NET-CONNECTED APPLICATIONS AND SERVICES, AND FOSTERING SYNERGIES BETWEEN WINDOWS AND THE WINDOWS SERVER SYSTEM OFFERINGS.

INFORMATION WORKER.

THE INFORMATION WORKER SEGMENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR DEVELOPING AND DELIVERING TECHNOLOGIES THAT

TRANSFORM INFORMATION INTO IMPACT FOR PEOPLE AND ORGANIZATIONS THAT CREATE, ANALYZE, COMMUNICATE, AND USE INFORMATION EVERY DAY. THE PRODUCTS IN THIS SEGMENT HELP PEOPLE TO BE MORE PRODUCTIVE, WITH MORE CONTROL OVER THEIR TIME AND MORE OPPORTUNITY

TO REALIZE THEIR POTENTIAL. THESE APPLICATIONS ARE A CRITICAL PART OF THE APPLICATION ARCHITECTURE FOR MANY ENTERPRISES, ENABLING BUSINESSES TO LIBERATE INFORMATION FROM INDIVIDUAL SILOS, BECOME MORE AGILE AND FLEXIBLE, AND RESPOND MORE READILY TO

NEW OPPORTUNITIES.

THE SEGMENT CONSISTS OF THE MICROSOFT OFFICE SYSTEM OF PROGRAMS, SERVERS, SERVICES, AND SOLUTIONS. MICROSOFT OFFICE SYSTEM 2003,

THE SUCCESSOR TO MICROSOFT OFFICE XP, WAS RELEASED TO MARKET IN THE FIRST HALF OF FISCAL 2004 AND HAS EVOLVED FROM A SUITE OF PERSONAL PRODUCTIVITY PRODUCTS TO A MORE COMPREHENSIVE AND INTEGRATED SYSTEM OF PRODUCTS DESIGNED TO INCREASE PERSONAL,

TEAM, AND ORGANIZATION PRODUCTIVITY. THE MICROSOFT OFFICE SYSTEM FEATURES INTEGRATION WITH MICROSOFT INTRANET COLLABORATION TECHNOLOGIES, INFORMATION RIGHTS MANAGEMENT, AND SUPPORT FOR INDUSTRY STANDARD XML. THE MICROSOFT OFFICE SYSTEM INCLUDES THE

MICROSOFT OFFICE 2003 EDITIONS, WHICH INCLUDE (DEPENDING UPON THE EDITION): MICROSOFT OFFICE OUTLOOK 2003; MICROSOFT OFFICE EXCEL 2003; MICROSOFT OFFICE POWERPOINT 2003; MICROSOFT OFFICE WORD 2003; AND MICROSOFT OFFICE ACCESS 2003. OTHER PRODUCTS IN

FRONTPAGE 2003; AND MICROSOFT OFFICE SHAREPOINT PORTAL SERVER 2003. IN ADDITION, THE INFORMATION WORKER SEGMENT INCLUDES MICROSOFT OFFICE LIVE MEETING WEB CONFERENCING SERVICE AND PROFESSIONAL PRODUCT SUPPORT.

HISTORICALLY, APPROXIMATELY 40 PERCENT OF INFORMATION WORKER BILLED REVENUE COMES FROM MULTI-YEAR LICENSE AGREEMENTS WITH LARGE ENTERPRISES. REVENUES FROM THESE

LICENSES GENERALLY DEPEND UPON THE NUMBER OF INFORMATION WORKERS IN A LICENSED ENTERPRISE. THEREFORE, OUR REVENUE FROM THIS CATEGORY OF AGREEMENTS IS RELATIVELY INDEPENDENT OF THE NUMBER OF PCS SOLD IN A GIVEN YEAR, BUT RATHER DEPENDS ON THE NUMBER

OF EMPLOYEES IN A GIVEN ENTERPRISE.

CONSEQUENTLY, GENERAL EMPLOYMENT LEVELS, PARTICULARLY IN NORTH AMERICA

AND EMEA, SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT INFORMATION WORKER REVENUE. APPROXIMATELY 40 PERCENT OF INFORMATION WORKER REVENUE COMES FROM NEW LICENSES ACQUIRED THROUGH FULLY PACKAGED PRODUCT AND TRANSACTIONAL VOLUME LICENSING PROGRAMS TO INDIVIDUAL CONSUMERS AND

ENTERPRISES OF ALL SIZES. MOST OF THIS REVENUE IS SENSITIVE TO INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY BUDGETS, WHICH OFTEN DEPEND ON GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS. THE REMAINING APPROXIMATELY 20 PERCENT OF INFORMATION WORKER REVENUE IS FROM LICENSES TO OEMS FOR NEW

PCS AND THROUGH SALES OF RETAIL PACKAGED PRODUCTS AND IS AFFECTED BY THE RELATIVE LEVEL OF PC SHIPMENTS.

FOR FISCAL 2004, THE SEGMENT INCLUDES THE

SMALL AND MID-MARKET SOLUTIONS & PARTNERS (SMS&P) ORGANIZATION, WHICH IS RESPONSIBLE FOR SALES, PARTNER MANAGEMENT, PARTNER PROGRAMS, AND CUSTOMER SEGMENT MARKETING TO SMALL AND MID-MARKET BUSINESSES. DURING FISCAL 2004, WE COMBINED THE

EXISTING SMALL AND MEDIUM BUSINESS SALES FORCE WITH THE SALES AND MARKETING ASSETS OF THE MICROSOFT BUSINESS SOLUTIONS SEGMENT TO FORM THE SMS&P ORGANIZATION. WE ANNOUNCED IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF FISCAL 2004 A REORGANIZATION WHICH, EFFECTIVE

JULY 1, 2004, WILL INCLUDE THE SMS&P ORGANIZATION IN THE MICROSOFT BUSINESS SOLUTIONS SEGMENT. THIS CHANGE IS DESIGNED TO OPTIMIZE OUR FOCUS ON DELIVERING BUSINESS APPLICATIONS TO SMALL AND MID-MARKET SEGMENT BUSINESSES.

ORGANIZATIONS ARE THE NORTH AMERICAN REGION; THE LATIN AMERICAN REGION; THE EUROPE, MIDDLE EAST, AND AFRICA REGION (EMEA); JAPAN; THE ASIA-PACIFIC REGION; GREATER CHINA; AND THE WORLDWIDE OEM CHANNEL. TO SERVE THE NEEDS OF CUSTOMERS AROUND THE

WORLD, WE LOCALIZE MANY OF OUR PRODUCTS TO REFLECT LOCAL LANGUAGES AND CONVENTIONS, AND TO IMPROVE THE QUALITY AND USABILITY OF THE PRODUCT IN INTERNATIONAL MARKETS. LOCALIZING A PRODUCT MAY REQUIRE MODIFYING THE USER INTERFACE, ALTERING

JAPAN, GREATER CHINA AND ASIA-PACIFIC REGION; AND THE CENTER IN THE

GREATER SEATTLE AREA SUPPORTS NORTH AMERICA AND LATIN AMERICA. MICROSOFT LICENSING, GP, A WHOLLY-OWNED ENTITY IN RENO, NEVADA, MANAGES OUR ORIGINAL EQUIPMENT MANUFACTURER (OEM) AND CERTAIN ORGANIZATIONAL LICENSING OPERATIONS AND BILLING.

WE CONTRACT MOST OF OUR MANUFACTURING ACTIVITIES TO THIRD PARTIES. OUTSIDE MANUFACTURERS PRODUCE THE XBOX, VARIOUS RETAIL SOFTWARE PACKAGED PRODUCTS, AND

MICROSOFT HARDWARE. OUR PRODUCTS MAY INCLUDE SOME COMPONENTS THAT ARE AVAILABLE FROM ONLY ONE OR LIMITED SOURCES. KEY COMPONENTS THAT ARE CURRENTLY OBTAINED FROM A SINGLE SOURCE INCLUDE THE XBOX CENTRAL PROCESSING UNIT (CPU) FROM INTEL CORPORATION

AND THE XBOX GRAPHICS PROCESSING UNIT (GPU) FROM NVIDIA CORPORATION. WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE XBOX CPU AND GPU, WE GENERALLY HAVE THE ABILITY TO USE OTHER CUSTOM MANUFACTURERS IF THE CURRENT MANUFACTURING VENDOR BECOMES UNAVAILABLE. WE GENERALLY

HAVE MULTIPLE SOURCES FOR RAW MATERIALS, SUPPLIES, AND COMPONENTS, AND ARE OFTEN ABLE TO ACQUIRE COMPONENT PARTS AND MATERIALS ON A VOLUME DISCOUNT BASIS.

PRESSURE TO GLOBALIZE OUR PRICING STRUCTURE MIGHT REQUIRE THAT WE REDUCE THE SALES PRICE OF OUR SOFTWARE IN THE UNITED STATES AND OTHER COUNTRIES. A NUMBER OF OTHER FACTORS COULD ALSO HAVE A NEGATIVE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS AND RESULTS FROM

OPERATIONS OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES, INCLUDING CHANGES IN TRADE PROTECTION LAWS, POLICIES AND MEASURES, AND OTHER REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS AFFECTING TRADE AND INVESTMENT; UNEXPECTED CHANGES IN REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS FOR SOFTWARE; SOCIAL,

POLITICAL, LABOR, OR ECONOMIC CONDITIONS IN A SPECIFIC COUNTRY OR REGION, INCLUDING FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES; DIFFICULTIES IN STAFFING AND MANAGING FOREIGN OPERATIONS; AND POTENTIAL ADVERSE FOREIGN TAX CONSEQUENCES. WE HEDGE A PORTION OF OUR

INTERNATIONAL CURRENCY EXPOSURES, THEREBY REDUCING OUR OVERALL TRANSLATION EXPOSURES.

PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT

DURING FISCAL 2002, 2003, AND 2004,

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSE WAS $6.30 BILLION, $6.60 BILLION, AND $7.78 BILLION RESPECTIVELY. THOSE AMOUNTS REPRESENTED 22.2%, 20.5%, AND 21.1%, RESPECTIVELY, OF REVENUE IN EACH OF THOSE YEARS. FISCAL 2002 AND 2003 HAVE BEEN RESTATED TO REFLECT

THE RETROACTIVE ADOPTION OF SFAS 123,

ACCOUNTING FOR STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION

. WE PLAN TO CONTINUE SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT ON A BROAD RANGE OF RESEARCH AND PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT.

MOST OF OUR SOFTWARE PRODUCTS ARE DEVELOPED INTERNALLY. WE ALSO PURCHASE TECHNOLOGY, LICENSE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS, AND OVERSEE THIRD-PARTY DEVELOPMENT AND

LOCALIZATION OF CERTAIN PRODUCTS. WE BELIEVE WE ARE NOT MATERIALLY DEPENDENT UPON LICENSES AND OTHER AGREEMENTS WITH THIRD PARTIES RELATING TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF OUR PRODUCTS. INTERNAL DEVELOPMENT ALLOWS US TO MAINTAIN CLOSER TECHNICAL CONTROL OVER

OUR PRODUCTS. IT ALSO GIVES US THE FREEDOM TO DECIDE WHICH MODIFICATIONS AND ENHANCEMENTS ARE MOST IMPORTANT AND WHEN THEY SHOULD BE IMPLEMENTED. PRODUCT DOCUMENTATION GENERALLY IS ALSO CREATED INTERNALLY. WE STRIVE TO OBTAIN INFORMATION AT THE

EARLIEST POSSIBLE TIME ABOUT CHANGING USAGE PATTERNS AND HARDWARE ADVANCES THAT MAY AFFECT SOFTWARE DESIGN. BEFORE RELEASING NEW SOFTWARE PLATFORMS, WE PROVIDE APPLICATION VENDORS WITH A RANGE OF RESOURCES AND GUIDELINES FOR DEVELOPMENT, TRAINING,

AND TESTING.

BUSINESS AND PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT

STRATEGY.

THE KEY TO MICROSOFTS GROWTH IS INNOVATION. IN FISCAL 2004, WE FILED FOR MORE THAN 2,000 PATENTS FOR NEW TECHNOLOGIES, AND WE EXPECT THAT NUMBER TO INCREASE. WE EXPECT THESE INNOVATIONS TO LEAD TO

REVENUE GROWTH FROM MARKET EXPANSION, SHARE GROWTH, NEW SCENARIOS AND MARKET OPPORTUNITIES, AND VALUE-ADDED THROUGH SERVICES.

KEY AREAS OF FOCUS

INCLUDE.



PC MARKET GROWTH.

IT TOOK MORE THAN 20 YEARS TO GROW THE WORLDWIDE BASE OF PC USERS TO 600+ MILLION. BY 2010, WE EXPECT THIS BASE TO GROW TO 1 BILLION,

DUE TO OPPORTUNITIES IN EMERGING MARKETS AND NEW SCENARIOS AND FORM FACTORS EXPECTED TO STIMULATE DEMAND. OUR CONTINUED SUCCESS WILL DEPEND ON DELIVERING SECURE, GROUNDBREAKING SOFTWARE AND COMPELLING SCENARIOS THAT CAPTURE THE IMAGINATION OF END

USERS. WE ARE WORKING ON NEW PC AND WINDOWS DESIGNS TO MAKE PCS AFFORDABLE TO MILLIONS OF ADDITIONAL PEOPLE AROUND THE WORLD.



NEW INFORMATION WORKER SCENARIOS.

WE BELIEVE ONE OF OUR BIGGEST GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES IS WITH OUR EXISTING BASE OF OFFICE USERS. WE PLAN TO PURSUE THIS MARKET BY

DELIVERING NEW INFORMATION WORKER SCENARIOS SUCH AS COLLABORATION, AUTHORING, COMMUNICATIONS, PLANNING AND ANALYSIS, AND EXPANDING THE TOOLSET WITH NEW TECHNOLOGIES SUCH AS SHAREPOINT, LIVE MEETING, ONENOTE AND INFOPATH.

EFFECTIVELY.



COMMUNICATIONS.

BROADBAND AND WIRELESS TECHNOLOGY IS INCREASING THE AMOUNT OF TIME PEOPLE SPEND ONLINE. YOUNGER AND SAVVIER INTERNET USERS WANT COMMUNICATIONS

EXPERIENCES TO BUILD THEIR SOCIAL NETWORK ON ANY DEVICE. WE BELIEVE PROFESSIONALS AND INFORMATION WORKERS WANT INTEGRATED, SECURE FUNCTIONALITY THAT HELP THEM MANAGE THEIR PERSONAL AND PROFESSIONAL LIVES: PERSONALIZED EMAIL, INSTANT MESSAGING,

CONTACT MANAGEMENT, SHARED CALENDARS, AND RELATIONSHIP MANAGEMENT. WE ARE PURSUING THESE OPPORTUNITIES BY DEVELOPING COMMUNICATIONS OFFERINGS DESIGNED TO PROVIDE THE GREATEST BENEFIT TO CONSUMERS AND DEVICE MANUFACTURERS. FOR EXAMPLE, OUR WINDOWS

MOBILE SOFTWARE IS THE BASIS FOR NEW MOBILE SMARTPHONES AND FOR PORTABLE MEDIA CENTER DEVICES FROM LEADING CONSUMER ELECTRONICS COMPANIES.

ORGANIZATIONS ARE THE NORTH AMERICAN REGION; THE LATIN AMERICAN REGION; THE EUROPE, MIDDLE EAST, AND AFRICA REGION; JAPAN; THE ASIA-PACIFIC REGION AND GREATER CHINA.

OEM.

OUR OPERATING SYSTEMS ARE LICENSED PRIMARILY TO OEMS UNDER AGREEMENTS THAT GRANT THE OEMS THE RIGHT TO BUILD

COMPUTING DEVICES BASED ON OUR OPERATING SYSTEMS, PRINCIPALLY PCS. UNDER SIMILAR ARRANGEMENTS, WE ALSO MARKET AND LICENSE CERTAIN SERVER OPERATING SYSTEMS, DESKTOP APPLICATIONS, HARDWARE DEVICES, AND CONSUMER SOFTWARE PRODUCTS TO OEMS. WE HAVE OEM

AGREEMENTS COVERING ONE OR MORE OF OUR PRODUCTS WITH VIRTUALLY ALL OF THE

MAJOR PC OEMS, INCLUDING ACER, ACTEBIS, DELL, EMACHINES, FUJITSU,

GATEWAY, HP, IBM, NEC, SAMSUNG, SIEMENS COMPUTERS, SONY, AND TOSHIBA. A SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF OEM BUSINESS IS ALSO CONDUCTED WITH SYSTEM BUILDERS, WHICH ARE LOW-VOLUME CUSTOMIZED PC VENDORS OPERATING IN LOCAL MARKETS.

DISTRIBUTORS AND RESELLERS.

WE DISTRIBUTE OUR FINISHED GOODS

PRODUCTS PRIMARILY THROUGH INDEPENDENT NON-EXCLUSIVE DISTRIBUTORS, AUTHORIZED REPLICATORS, RESELLERS, AND RETAIL OUTLETS. ORGANIZATIONS LICENSE OUR PRODUCTS PRIMARILY THROUGH LARGE ACCOUNT RESELLERS (LARS), DIRECT MARKET RESELLERS (DMRS), AND

VALUE-ADDED RESELLERS. MANY ORGANIZATIONS THAT LICENSE PRODUCTS THROUGH ENTERPRISE AGREEMENTS (EAS) NOW TRANSACT DIRECTLY WITH US, WITH SALES SUPPORT FROM OUR ENTERPRISE SOFTWARE ADVISOR CHANNEL PARTNERS. THESE ENTERPRISE SOFTWARE ADVISORS TYPICALLY

ARE ALSO AUTHORIZED AS LARS AND OPERATE AS RESELLERS FOR OUR OTHER LICENSING PROGRAMS. ALTHOUGH EACH TYPE OF RESELLING PARTNER REACHES ORGANIZATIONS OF ALL SIZES, LARS ARE PRIMARILY ENGAGED WITH LARGE ORGANIZATIONS AND VALUE-ADDED RESELLERS

TYPICALLY REACH THE BREADTH OF SMALL- AND MEDIUM-SIZED ORGANIZATIONS. SOME OF OUR DISTRIBUTORS INCLUDE INGRAM MICRO AND TECH DATA, AND SOME OF OUR LARGEST RESELLERS INCLUDE SOFTWARE SPECTRUM, SOFTWARE HOUSE INTERNATIONAL, DELL, CDW, AND INSIGHT

ENTERPRISES. INDIVIDUAL CONSUMERS OBTAIN OUR PRODUCTS PRIMARILY THROUGH RETAIL OUTLETS, INCLUDING BEST BUY, WAL-MART, AND TARGET. WE HAVE A NETWORK OF FIELD SALES REPRESENTATIVES AND FIELD SUPPORT PERSONNEL THAT SOLICITS ORDERS FROM DISTRIBUTORS AND

RESELLERS AND PROVIDES PRODUCT TRAINING AND SALES SUPPORT.

WE LICENSE SOFTWARE TO ORGANIZATIONS UNDER ARRANGEMENTS THAT ALLOW THE END-USER CUSTOMER

TO ACQUIRE MULTIPLE LICENSES OF PRODUCT. THESE ARRANGEMENTS ARE DESIGNED TO PROVIDE ORGANIZATIONS WITH A MEANS OF ACQUIRING MULTIPLE LICENSES, WITHOUT HAVING TO ACQUIRE SEPARATE PACKAGED PRODUCT THROUGH RETAIL CHANNELS. IN DELIVERING ORGANIZATIONAL

LICENSING ARRANGEMENTS TO THE MARKET, WE USE DIFFERENT PROGRAMS DESIGNED TO PROVIDE FLEXIBILITY FOR ORGANIZATIONS OF VARIOUS SIZES. WHILE THESE PROGRAMS MAY DIFFER IN VARIOUS PARTS OF THE WORLD, GENERALLY THEY ARE AS FOLLOWS.

OPEN.

DESIGNED PRIMARILY FOR SMALL-TO-MEDIUM

ORGANIZATIONS (5 TO OVER 250 LICENSES), THIS PROGRAM ALLOWS CUSTOMERS TO ACQUIRE PERPETUAL LICENSES AND, AT THE CUSTOMERS ELECTION, RIGHTS TO FUTURE VERSIONS OF SOFTWARE PRODUCTS OVER A SPECIFIED TIME PERIOD (GENERALLY TWO YEARS). THE OFFERING

THAT CONVEYS RIGHTS TO FUTURE VERSIONS OF SOFTWARE PRODUCT OVER THE CONTRACT PERIOD IS CALLED SOFTWARE ASSURANCE. SOFTWARE ASSURANCE ALSO PROVIDES SUPPORT, TOOLS, AND TRAINING TO HELP CUSTOMERS DEPLOY AND USE SOFTWARE EFFICIENTLY. UNDER THE OPEN

PROGRAM, CUSTOMERS CAN ACQUIRE LICENSES ONLY, OR LICENSES WITH SOFTWARE ASSURANCE. THEY CAN ALSO RENEW SOFTWARE ASSURANCE UPON THE EXPIRATION OF EXISTING VOLUME LICENSING AGREEMENTS.

SELECT.

DESIGNED PRIMARILY FOR MEDIUM-TO-LARGE ORGANIZATIONS (GREATER THAN 250 LICENSES), THIS

PROGRAM ALLOWS CUSTOMERS TO ACQUIRE PERPETUAL LICENSES AND, AT THE CUSTOMERS ELECTION, SOFTWARE ASSURANCE, WHICH CONSISTS OF RIGHTS TO FUTURE VERSIONS OF SOFTWARE PRODUCTS, SUPPORT, TOOLS, AND TRAINING OVER A SPECIFIED TIME PERIOD (GENERALLY

THREE YEARS). SIMILAR TO THE OPEN PROGRAM, CUSTOMERS CAN ACQUIRE LICENSES ONLY, ACQUIRE LICENSES WITH SOFTWARE ASSURANCE, OR RENEW SOFTWARE ASSURANCE UPON THE EXPIRATION OF EXISTING VOLUME LICENSING AGREEMENTS.

ENTERPRISE AGREEMENT.

THE ENTERPRISE AGREEMENT IS

TARGETED AT MEDIUM AND LARGE ORGANIZATIONS THAT WANT TO ACQUIRE PERPETUAL LICENSES TO SOFTWARE PRODUCTS FOR ALL OR SUBSTANTIAL PARTS OF THEIR ENTERPRISE, ALONG WITH RIGHTS TO FUTURE VERSIONS OF SOFTWARE PRODUCTS, GENERALLY OVER A THREE-YEAR PERIOD.

ENTERPRISE SUBSCRIPTION

AGREEMENT.

THE ENTERPRISE SUBSCRIPTION AGREEMENT (ESA) IS A TIME-BASED, MULTI-YEAR LICENSING AGREEMENT. UNDER AN ESA, CUSTOMERS ACQUIRE THE RIGHT TO USE THE CURRENT VERSION OF SOFTWARE PRODUCTS AND THE FUTURE VERSIONS

THAT ARE RELEASED DURING THE THREE-YEAR TERM OF THE AGREEMENT. AT THE END OF THE TERM, CUSTOMERS MAY EITHER RENEW THEIR ESA OR EXERCISE A BUY-OUT OPTION TO OBTAIN PERPETUAL LICENSES FOR THE LATEST VERSION OF THE COVERED PRODUCTS. IF THEY DO NOT

ELECT ONE OF THESE OPTIONS, THEN ALL PREVIOUSLY COVERED SOFTWARE MUST BE UNINSTALLED.

ONLINE SERVICES.

WE DISTRIBUTE ONLINE CONTENT AND SERVICES THROUGH MSN AND OTHER ONLINE SERVICES. MSN DELIVERS INTERNET ACCESS AND OTHER PREMIUM SERVICES AND TOOLS TO CONSUMERS. MSN ALSO DELIVERS ONLINE

E-MAIL AND MESSAGING COMMUNICATION SERVICES AS WELL AS INFORMATION SERVICES SUCH AS ONLINE SEARCH AND PREMIUM CONTENT. MICROSOFT BUSINESS SOLUTIONS OPERATES THE BCENTRAL SMALL-BUSINESS PORTAL, WHICH IS DELIVERED ONLINE. THE BCENTRAL PORTAL PROVIDES

TOOLS AND EXPERTISE FOR SMALL-BUSINESS OWNERS TO BUILD, MARKET, AND MANAGE THEIR BUSINESSES ONLINE. OTHER SERVICES DELIVERED ONLINE INCLUDE XBOX LIVE, MICROSOFT DEVELOPER NETWORKS (MSDN) SUBSCRIPTION CONTENT AND UPDATES, PERIODIC PRODUCT UPDATES,

AND ONLINE TECHNICAL AND PRACTICE READINESS RESOURCES TO SUPPORT OUR PARTNERS IN DEVELOPING AND SELLING OUR PRODUCTS AND SOLUTIONS.

CUSTOMERS

OUR CUSTOMERS INCLUDE INDIVIDUAL CONSUMERS, SMALL AND MEDIUM-SIZED ORGANIZATIONS, ENTERPRISES,

GOVERNMENTAL INSTITUTIONS, EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS, INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDERS, APPLICATION DEVELOPERS, AND OEMS. CONSUMERS AND SMALL AND MEDIUM-SIZED ORGANIZATIONS OBTAIN OUR PRODUCTS PRIMARILY THROUGH RESELLERS AND OEMS. SALES TO DELL AND ITS

SUBSIDIARIES IN THE AGGREGATE ACCOUNTED FOR APPROXIMATELY 10% OF FISCAL 2004 REVENUE. THESE SALES WERE MADE PRIMARILY THROUGH OUR OEM AND VOLUME LICENSING CHANNELS. NO SINGLE CUSTOMER ACCOUNTED FOR MORE THAN 10% OF REVENUE IN 2002 OR 2003. OUR

PRACTICE IS TO SHIP OUR PRODUCTS PROMPTLY UPON RECEIPT OF PURCHASE ORDERS FROM CUSTOMERS; CONSEQUENTLY, BACKLOG IS NOT SIGNIFICANT.

COMPETITION

THE SOFTWARE BUSINESS IS INTENSELY COMPETITIVE AND SUBJECT TO RAPID TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE, EVOLVING CUSTOMER REQUIREMENTS, AND CHANGING BUSINESS MODELS IN EVERY SEGMENT. WE FACE SIGNIFICANT COMPETITION IN ALL AREAS OF OUR

BUSINESS. THE RAPID PACE OF TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE CONTINUALLY CREATES NEW OPPORTUNITIES FOR EXISTING COMPETITORS AND START-UPS AND CAN QUICKLY RENDER EXISTING TECHNOLOGIES LESS VALUABLE. CUSTOMER REQUIREMENTS AND PREFERENCES CONTINUALLY CHANGE AS

OTHER INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES EMERGE OR BECOME LESS EXPENSIVE, AND AS CONCERNS SUCH AS SECURITY AND PRIVACY BECOME MORE IMPORTANT. OUR DIRECT COMPETITORS INCLUDE FIRMS ADOPTING ALTERNATIVE BUSINESS MODELS TO THE COMMERCIAL SOFTWARE MODEL. FIRMS

ADOPTING THE NON-COMMERCIAL SOFTWARE MODEL TYPICALLY PROVIDE CUSTOMERS WITH OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE AT NOMINAL COST AND EARN REVENUE ON COMPLEMENTARY SERVICES AND PRODUCTS, WITHOUT HAVING TO BEAR THE FULL COSTS OF RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT FOR THE OPEN

SOURCE SOFTWARE. GLOBAL SOFTWARE PIRACY  THE UNLAWFUL COPYING AND DISTRIBUTION OF OUR COPYRIGHTED SOFTWARE PRODUCTS  DEPRIVES US OF SIGNIFICANT AMOUNTS OF REVENUE ON AN ANNUAL BASIS. FUTURE VERSIONS OF OUR PRODUCTS

COMPETE WITH THE EXISTING VERSIONS LICENSED TO OUR INSTALLED BASE OF CUSTOMERS. THIS MEANS THAT FUTURE VERSIONS MUST DELIVER SIGNIFICANT ADDITIONAL VALUE IN ORDER TO INDUCE EXISTING CUSTOMERS TO PURCHASE A NEW VERSION OF OUR PRODUCT.

OUR COMPETITIVE POSITION MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED IN THE FUTURE BY ONE OR MORE OF THE FACTORS DESCRIBED IN THIS SECTION, OR AS YET UNDEFINED ADDITIONAL FACTORS

THAT MAY ARISE.

CLIENT.

ALTHOUGH WE ARE THE LEADER

IN PC OPERATING SYSTEM SOFTWARE PRODUCTS, WE FACE STRONG COMPETITION FROM WELL-ESTABLISHED COMPANIES AND ENTITIES WITH DIFFERING APPROACHES TO THE MARKET. COMPETING COMMERCIAL SOFTWARE PRODUCTS, INCLUDING VARIANTS OF UNIX, ARE SUPPLIED BY

COMPETITORS SUCH AS IBM, HEWLETT-PACKARD, APPLE COMPUTER, SUN MICROSYSTEMS AND OTHERS, WHICH ARE VERTICALLY INTEGRATED IN BOTH SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT AND HARDWARE MANUFACTURING AND HAVE DEVELOPED OPERATING SYSTEMS THAT THEY PREINSTALL ON THEIR OWN

COMPUTERS. PERSONAL COMPUTER OEMS WHO PREINSTALL THIRD-PARTY OPERATING SYSTEMS MAY ALSO LICENSE THESE FIRMS OPERATING SYSTEMS. THE LINUX OPERATING SYSTEM, WHICH IS ALSO DERIVED FROM UNIX AND IS AVAILABLE WITHOUT PAYMENT UNDER A GENERAL PUBLIC

LICENSE, HAS GAINED INCREASING ACCEPTANCE AS COMPETITIVE PRESSURES LEAD PERSONAL COMPUTER OEMS TO REDUCE COSTS. THE MICROSOFT WINDOWS OPERATING SYSTEMS ALSO FACE COMPETITION FROM ALTERNATIVE PLATFORMS, AS WELL AS INNOVATIVE DEVICES THAT MAY REDUCE

CONSUMER DEMAND FOR TRADITIONAL PERSONAL COMPUTERS. WE BELIEVE OUR OPERATING SYSTEM PRODUCTS COMPETE EFFECTIVELY BY DELIVERING BETTER INNOVATION, AN EASY-TO-USE INTERFACE, COMPATIBILITY WITH A BROAD RANGE OF HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE APPLICATIONS, AND

THE LARGEST SUPPORT NETWORK FOR ANY OPERATING SYSTEM.

SERVER AND

TOOLS.

OUR SERVER OPERATING SYSTEM PRODUCTS FACE INTENSE COMPETITION FROM A WIDE VARIETY OF COMPETING SERVER OPERATING SYSTEMS AND SERVER APPLICATIONS, OFFERED BY FIRMS WITH A VARIETY OF MARKET APPROACHES.

VERTICALLY INTEGRATED COMPUTER MANUFACTURERS SUCH AS IBM, HEWLETT-PACKARD, SUN MICROSYSTEMS AND OTHERS OFFER THEIR OWN VARIANT OF UNIX PREINSTALLED ON SERVER HARDWARE, AND NEARLY ALL COMPUTER MANUFACTURERS OFFER SERVER HARDWARE FOR THE LINUX

OPERATING SYSTEM. IBMS ENDORSEMENT OF LINUX HAS ACCELERATED ITS ACCEPTANCE AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO BOTH TRADITIONAL UNIX AND WINDOWS SERVER OPERATING SYSTEMS. LINUXS COMPETITIVE POSITION HAS ALSO BENEFITED FROM THE LARGE NUMBER OF

COMPATIBLE APPLICATIONS NOW PRODUCED BY MANY LEADING COMMERCIAL SOFTWARE DEVELOPERS AS WELL AS NON-COMMERCIAL SOFTWARE DEVELOPERS. A NUMBER OF COMPANIES SUPPLY VERSIONS OF LINUX, INCLUDING NOVELL AND RED HAT.

WE COMPETE IN THE BUSINESS OF PROVIDING ENTERPRISE-WIDE COMPUTING SOLUTIONS WITH SEVERAL COMPANIES THAT PROVIDE COMPETING SOLUTIONS AS WELL AS MIDDLEWARE TECHNOLOGY

PLATFORMS. IBM AND SUN MICROSYSTEMS LEAD A GROUP OF COMPANIES FOCUSED ON THE JAVA 2 PLATFORM ENTERPRISE EDITION (J2EE). COMMERCIAL SOFTWARE DEVELOPERS THAT PROVIDE COMPETING SERVER APPLICATIONS FOR THE PC-BASED DISTRIBUTED CLIENT/SERVER ENVIRONMENTS

INCLUDE ORACLE, IBM, AND COMPUTER ASSOCIATES. THERE ARE ALSO A NUMBER OF NON-COMMERCIAL SOFTWARE SERVER APPLICATIONS AVAILABLE.

ITEM 1

NUMEROUS COMMERCIAL SOFTWARE VENDORS OFFER COMPETING

COMMERCIAL SOFTWARE APPLICATIONS FOR CONNECTIVITY (BOTH INTERNET AND INTRANET), SECURITY, HOSTING, AND E-BUSINESS SERVERS. ADDITIONALLY, IBM HAS A LARGE INSTALLED BASE OF LOTUS NOTES AND CC:MAIL, BOTH OF WHICH COMPETE WITH OUR COLLABORATION AND

E-MAIL PRODUCTS. THERE ARE ALSO A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF NON-COMMERCIAL SOFTWARE PRODUCTS THAT COMPETE WITH OUR SOLUTIONS, INCLUDING APACHE WEB SERVER.

OUR DEVELOPER PRODUCTS COMPETE AGAINST OFFERINGS FROM BEA SYSTEMS, BORLAND, IBM, MACROMEDIA, ORACLE, SUN MICROSYSTEMS, AND OTHER COMPANIES.

WE BELIEVE THAT OUR SERVER PRODUCTS PROVIDE CUSTOMERS WITH SIGNIFICANT ADVANTAGES IN INNOVATION, PERFORMANCE (BOTH RELATIVE TO TOTAL COSTS OF OWNERSHIP AND IN ABSOLUTE TERMS), PRODUCTIVITY, APPLICATIONS DEVELOPMENT TOOLS AND ENVIRONMENT,

COMPATIBILITY WITH A BROAD BASE OF HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE APPLICATIONS, SECURITY, AND MANAGEABILITY.

INFORMATION WORKER.

WHILE WE ARE THE LEADER IN BUSINESS PRODUCTIVITY SOFTWARE APPLICATIONS FOR PERSONAL COMPUTERS, COMPETITORS TO THE MICROSOFT OFFICE SYSTEM INCLUDE MANY SOFTWARE

APPLICATION VENDORS SUCH AS APPLE, COREL, IBM, ORACLE, SUN MICROSYSTEMS, AND LOCAL APPLICATION DEVELOPERS IN EUROPE AND ASIA. IBM AND COREL HAVE SIGNIFICANT INSTALLED BASES WITH THEIR OFFICE PRODUCTIVITY PRODUCTS, AND BOTH HAVE AGGRESSIVE PRICING

STRATEGIES. ALSO, APPLE AND IBM PREINSTALL CERTAIN OF THEIR APPLICATION SOFTWARE PRODUCTS ON VARIOUS MODELS OF THEIR PCS, COMPETING DIRECTLY WITH OUR APPLICATIONS. CORELS SUITE AND SUN MICROSYSTEMS STAR OFFICE ARE AGGRESSIVELY PRICED AND

ATTRACTIVE FOR OEMS TO PREINSTALL ON LOW-PRICED PCS. THE OPENOFFICE.ORG PROJECT PROVIDES A FREELY DOWNLOADABLE CROSS-PLATFORM APPLICATION THAT IS GAINING POPULARITY IN CERTAIN MARKET SEGMENTS. IN ADDITION TO TRADITIONAL CLIENT-SIDE APPLICATIONS,

WEB-BASED OFFERINGS SUCH AS SIMDESK PROVIDE AN ALTERNATIVE TO MICROSOFT OFFICE SYSTEM PRODUCTS. IN ADDITION, IBM HAS A SIGNIFICANT INSTALLED BASE OF MESSAGING AND COLLABORATION SOFTWARE. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR PRODUCTS COMPETE EFFECTIVELY BY PROVIDING

CUSTOMERS SIGNIFICANT BENEFITS, SUCH AS EASE OF USE, PERSONAL PRODUCTIVITY, SUPPORT FOR EFFECTIVE TEAMING AND COLLABORATION, AND BETTER INFORMATION MANAGEMENT AND CONTROL, AND BY PROVIDING MANY CUSTOMERS A LOWER TOTAL COST OF OWNERSHIP THAN

ALTERNATIVES.

MICROSOFT BUSINESS SOLUTIONS.

THE

SMALL AND MID-MARKET BUSINESS APPLICATIONS SEGMENT IS HIGHLY FRAGMENTED AND IS INTENSELY COMPETITIVE IN ALL SECTORS WHERE WE COMPETE. WE FACE COMPETITION FROM A LARGE NUMBER OF COMPANIES IN THIS BUSINESS. WELL-KNOWN VENDORS FOCUSED ON SMALL AND

MID-MARKET BUSINESS SOLUTIONS, SUCH AS INTUIT AND SAGE (ALONG WITH MANY OTHERS), COMPETE AGAINST US FOR A PORTION OF THIS SEGMENT. IN ADDITION, LARGE-ENTERPRISE FOCUSED VENDORS, SUCH AS ORACLE, PEOPLESOFT, AND SAP, ARE REPOSITIONING SOME OF THEIR

BUSINESS APPLICATIONS TO FOCUS ON SMALL AND MEDIUM-SIZED BUSINESS AND THUS ALSO COMPETE AGAINST US FOR A PORTION OF THIS SEGMENT. IN ADDITION, THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF OTHER VENDORS IN SPECIFIC LOCALITIES OR INDUSTRIES THAT OFFER THEIR OWN ENTERPRISE

RESOURCE PLANNING (ERP), CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIP MANAGEMENT (CRM), AND/OR ANALYTIC SOLUTIONS. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR BUSINESS APPLICATIONS PRODUCTS ACROSS FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT, SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT, AND CRM COMPETE EFFECTIVELY IN OUR TARGET SEGMENTS

BY OFFERING SOLUTIONS AND SERVICES THAT ADDRESS MULTIPLE SEGMENT NEEDS ACROSS INDUSTRIES THROUGH CONSISTENT INNOVATION IN PRODUCT FUNCTIONALITY DELIVERED THROUGH A GROWING NETWORK OF PARTNERS.

MSN.

MSN COMPETES WITH YAHOO!, GOOGLE, AOL, EARTHLINK, U.S. CABLE

AND DSL PROVIDERS, AND A VAST ARRAY OF WEB SITES AND PORTALS THAT OFFER CONTENT AND ONLINE SERVICES OF ALL TYPES. MSN ALSO COMPETES WITH TRADITIONAL ADVERTISING AND PRINT MEDIA. AS THE BROADBAND ACCESS MARKET GROWS, WE EXPECT TO HAVE INCREASING

OPPORTUNITIES TO DELIVER RICH AND COMPELLING SERVICES AND EXPERIENCES FOR CONSUMERS. MSNS ADVERTISING REVENUE HAS GROWN CONSIDERABLY OVER THE LAST YEAR, AND WE EXPECT THIS TREND TO CONTINUE IN DISPLAY ADVERTISING AS WELL AS IN SEARCH-BASED

ADVERTISING, AS ONLINE ADVERTISING CONTINUES TO GAIN MARKET ACCEPTANCE. THIS GROWTH HAS LED TO COMPETITORS AGGRESSIVELY PURSUING BOTH ADVERTISERS AND CONSUMERS WITH EXPANDED OFFERINGS AND NEW TECHNOLOGY. WE ARE BUILDING OUR OWN ALGORITHMIC SEARCH

ENGINE AND INVESTING TO SUPPORT THE CONTINUED GROWTH OF OUR ADVERTISING BUSINESS. DUE TO THE CONTINUING TREND OF CONSUMERS MIGRATING FROM NARROWBAND TO BROADBAND INTERNET ACCESS, WE EXPECT OUR NARROWBAND INTERNET ACCESS SUBSCRIBER BASE TO DECLINE.

WE BELIEVE OUR COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE COMES FROM OUR ABILITY TO EMPOWER PEOPLE GLOBALLY THROUGH INFORMATION SOFTWARE AND SERVICES THAT HELP THEM FIND, DISCOVER, AND EXPERIENCE WHAT THEY WANT ONLINE.

MOBILE AND EMBEDDED DEVICES.

WINDOWS MOBILE SOFTWARE FACES

SUBSTANTIAL COMPETITION FROM NOKIA, OPENWAVE SYSTEMS, PALMSOURCE, QUALCOMM, AND SYMBIAN. THE EMBEDDED OPERATING SYSTEM MARKET IS HIGHLY FRAGMENTED WITH MANY COMPETITIVE OFFERINGS. KEY COMPETITORS INCLUDE IBM, WIND RIVER, AND VERSIONS OF EMBEDDABLE

LINUX FROM COMMERCIAL LINUX VENDORS SUCH AS METROWERKS AND MONTAVISTA SOFTWARE. MAPPOINT COMPETITORS INCLUDE DELORME, MAPINFO, MAPQUEST.COM, RAND MCNALLY, WEBRASKA MOBILE TECHNOLOGIES, AND YAHOO! THE TELEMATICS MARKET IS ALSO HIGHLY FRAGMENTED, WITH

COMPETITIVE OFFERINGS FROM IBM AND AUTOMOTIVE SUPPLIERS BUILDING ON VARIOUS REAL-TIME

OPERATING SYSTEM PLATFORMS FROM COMMERCIAL LINUX VENDORS, QNX

SOFTWARE SYSTEMS, WIND RIVER, AND OTHERS. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR PRODUCTS COMPETE EFFECTIVELY BY PROVIDING A FAMILIAR DEVELOPMENT FRAMEWORK THAT ENABLES DEVELOPERS TO EASILY WRITE AND DEPLOY INNOVATIVE APPLICATIONS FOR MOBILE OR EMBEDDED DEVICES;

PROVIDING A FLEXIBLE PLATFORM THAT ALLOWS CUSTOMERS AND PARTNERS TO BUILD DIFFERENTIATED AND PROFITABLE BUSINESS MODELS; AND PROVIDING END USERS SIGNIFICANT BENEFITS SUCH AS EASE OF USE, PERSONAL PRODUCTIVITY, AND BETTER INFORMATION MANAGEMENT AND

CONTROL.

HOME AND ENTERTAINMENT.

THE HOME AND

ENTERTAINMENT BUSINESS IS HIGHLY COMPETITIVE AND IS CHARACTERIZED BY LIMITED PLATFORM LIFE CYCLES, FREQUENT INTRODUCTIONS OF NEW PRODUCTS AND TITLES, AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW TECHNOLOGIES. THE MARKETS FOR OUR PRODUCTS ARE CHARACTERIZED BY

SIGNIFICANT PRICE COMPETITION, AND WE ANTICIPATE CONTINUED PRICING PRESSURE FROM OUR COMPETITORS. THESE PRESSURES HAVE, FROM TIME TO TIME, REQUIRED US TO REDUCE PRICES ON CERTAIN PRODUCTS. OUR COMPETITORS VARY IN SIZE FROM VERY SMALL COMPANIES WITH

LIMITED RESOURCES TO VERY LARGE, DIVERSIFIED CORPORATIONS WITH SUBSTANTIAL FINANCIAL AND MARKETING RESOURCES. WE COMPETE PRIMARILY ON THE BASIS OF PRICE, PRODUCT QUALITY AND VARIETY, TIMING OF PRODUCT RELEASES, AND EFFECTIVENESS OF DISTRIBUTION AND

MARKETING.

OUR XBOX HARDWARE BUSINESS COMPETES WITH CONSOLE PLATFORMS FROM NINTENDO AND SONY, BOTH OF WHICH HAVE A LARGE ESTABLISHED BASE OF

CUSTOMERS. IN ADDITION TO COMPETING AGAINST SOFTWARE PUBLISHED FOR NON-XBOX PLATFORMS, OUR GAMES BUSINESS ALSO COMPETES WITH NUMEROUS COMPANIES THAT HAVE BEEN LICENSED BY US TO DEVELOP AND PUBLISH SOFTWARE FOR THE XBOX CONSOLE. THESE COMPETITORS

INCLUDE ACCLAIM ENTERTAINMENT, ACTIVISION, ATARI, CAPCOM, EIDOS, ELECTRONIC ARTS, SEGA, TAKE-TWO INTERACTIVE, TECMO, THQ, AND UBI SOFT, AMONG OTHERS. SUCCESS IN THE GAMES BUSINESS IS INCREASINGLY DRIVEN BY HIT TITLES, WHICH ARE DIFFICULT TO DEVELOP

AND REQUIRE SUBSTANTIAL INVESTMENTS IN DEVELOPMENT AND MARKETING. IN ADDITION, OTHER FORMS OF ENTERTAINMENT SUCH AS MUSIC, MOTION PICTURES, AND TELEVISION COMPETE AGAINST OUR ENTERTAINMENT SOFTWARE FOR CONSUMER SPENDING. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR XBOX

PRODUCTS COMPETE EFFECTIVELY BY PROVIDING CUSTOMERS BENEFITS SUCH AS SUPERIOR GAME CONSOLE PERFORMANCE, EXCLUSIVE GAME CONTENT, AND INNOVATIVE ONLINE MULTIPLAYER GAMING THROUGH XBOX LIVE. OUR PC HARDWARE PRODUCTS FACE AGGRESSIVE COMPETITION FROM

COMPUTER AND OTHER HARDWARE MANUFACTURERS, MANY OF WHICH ARE ALSO CURRENT OR POTENTIAL PARTNERS.

EMPLOYEES

AS OF JUNE 30, 2004, WE

EMPLOYED APPROXIMATELY 57,000 PEOPLE ON A FULL-TIME BASIS, 37,000 IN THE UNITED STATES AND 20,000 INTERNATIONALLY. OF THE TOTAL, 24,000 WERE IN PRODUCT RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, 16,000 IN SALES AND MARKETING, 11,000 IN PRODUCT SUPPORT AND CONSULTING

SERVICES, 2,000 IN MANUFACTURING AND DISTRIBUTION, AND 4,000 IN GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATION. OUR SUCCESS IS HIGHLY DEPENDENT ON OUR ABILITY TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN QUALIFIED EMPLOYEES. COMPETITION FOR EMPLOYEES IS INTENSE IN THE SOFTWARE INDUSTRY. WE

BELIEVE WE HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN OUR EFFORTS TO RECRUIT QUALIFIED EMPLOYEES, BUT WE CANNOT GUARANTEE THAT WE WILL CONTINUE TO BE AS SUCCESSFUL IN THE FUTURE. NONE OF OUR EMPLOYEES ARE SUBJECT TO COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENTS. WE BELIEVE THAT

OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH OUR EMPLOYEES IS EXCELLENT.

ITEM 7.    MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR 2002, 2003, AND 2004

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (MD&A) CONTAINS STATEMENTS THAT ARE FORWARD-LOOKING.

THESE STATEMENTS ARE BASED ON CURRENT EXPECTATIONS AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT ARE SUBJECT TO RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES. ACTUAL RESULTS COULD DIFFER MATERIALLY BECAUSE OF FACTORS DISCUSSED IN ISSUES AND UNCERTAINTIES AND ELSEWHERE IN THIS REPORT.

OVERVIEW

THE FOLLOWING MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (MD&A) IS INTENDED TO HELP THE

READER UNDERSTAND MICROSOFT CORPORATION. MD&A IS PROVIDED AS A SUPPLEMENT TO, AND SHOULD BE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH, OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND THE ACCOMPANYING NOTES (NOTES).

WE GENERATE REVENUES, INCOME AND CASH FLOWS BY DEVELOPING, MANUFACTURING, LICENSING, AND SUPPORTING A WIDE RANGE OF SOFTWARE PRODUCTS FOR MANY COMPUTING DEVICES.

OUR SOFTWARE PRODUCTS INCLUDE OPERATING SYSTEMS FOR SERVERS, PERSONAL COMPUTERS (PCS), AND INTELLIGENT DEVICES; SERVER APPLICATIONS FOR DISTRIBUTED COMPUTING ENVIRONMENTS; INFORMATION WORKER PRODUCTIVITY APPLICATIONS; BUSINESS SOLUTIONS

APPLICATIONS; AND SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT TOOLS. WE PROVIDE CONSULTING AND PRODUCT SUPPORT SERVICES, AND WE TRAIN AND CERTIFY SYSTEM INTEGRATORS AND DEVELOPERS. WE SELL THE XBOX VIDEO GAME CONSOLE AND GAMES, PC GAMES AND PERIPHERALS. ONLINE

COMMUNICATION SERVICES AND INFORMATION SERVICES ARE DELIVERED THROUGH OUR MSN PORTALS AND CHANNELS AROUND THE WORLD.

WE ALSO RESEARCH AND DEVELOP

ADVANCED TECHNOLOGIES FOR FUTURE SOFTWARE PRODUCTS. DELIVERING BREAKTHROUGH INNOVATION AND HIGH-VALUE SOLUTIONS THROUGH OUR INTEGRATED PLATFORM ARE THE KEY TO MEETING CUSTOMER NEEDS AND TO OUR FUTURE GROWTH.

WE BELIEVE THAT OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS WE HAVE LAID A FOUNDATION FOR LONG-TERM GROWTH, DELIVERING INNOVATIVE NEW PRODUCTS, CREATING OPPORTUNITY FOR PARTNERS,

IMPROVING CUSTOMER SATISFACTION WITH KEY AUDIENCES, PUTTING SOME OF OUR MOST SIGNIFICANT LEGAL CHALLENGES BEHIND US, AND SOLIDIFYING INTERNAL PROCESSES. OUR FOCUS IN FISCAL 2005 IS BUILDING ON THIS FOUNDATION AND EXECUTING WELL IN KEY AREAS,

INCLUDING CONTINUING TO INNOVATE ON OUR INTEGRATED SOFTWARE PLATFORM, DELIVERING COMPELLING VALUE PROPOSITIONS TO CUSTOMERS, RESPONDING EFFECTIVELY TO CUSTOMER AND PARTNER NEEDS, AND CONTINUING TO FOCUS INTERNALLY ON PRODUCT EXCELLENCE, BUSINESS

EFFICACY, AND ACCOUNTABILITY ACROSS THE COMPANY.

KEY MARKET OPPORTUNITIES INCLUDE.



MEETING THE NEEDS OF A GROWING WORLDWIDE BASE OF PC USERS, WHICH WE PROJECT WILL TOP 1 BILLION BY 2010;



DELIVERING NEW SCENARIOS SUCH AS COLLABORATION, AUTHORING, COMMUNICATING, PLANNING, AND ANALYSIS FOR INFORMATION WORKERS;



CONTINUING TO COMPETE AGAINST LINUX AND UNIX FOR COMMERCIAL WORKLOADS;



REDUCING COMPLEXITY AND COST FOR IT PROFESSIONALS AND DEVELOPERS;



DELIVERING IT SERVICES FOR SMALLER BUSINESS, AND CONSUMERS;



CREATING AND DELIVERING BUSINESS SOLUTIONS FOR SMALL AND MID-MARKET SEGMENTS;



CREATING NON-PC CONSUMER ELECTRONICS IN AREAS SUCH AS MOBILE PHONES, HANDHELD DEVICES, HOME ENTERTAINMENT AND TV;



DELIVERING COMPELLING ENTERTAINMENT EXPERIENCES IN AREAS SUCH AS MUSIC, TV, MOVIES, PHOTOS, AND GAMES;



EXPANDING ONLINE ADVERTISING, AND ADVANCES IN SEARCH, MUSIC AND OTHER INFORMATION SERVICES;



DELIVERING INTEGRATED COMMUNICATIONS SERVICES FOR CONSUMERS AND INFORMATION WORKERS.

FOR FISCAL 2005, WE BELIEVE INDUSTRY-WIDE FACTORS SUCH AS PC UNIT GROWTH AND THE SUCCESS OF NON-COMMERCIAL SOFTWARE COULD SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. PC UNIT GROWTH WAS VERY STRONG IN FISCAL 2004, INCREASING APPROXIMATELY 13% FROM FISCAL 2003. WE DO NOT EXPECT SIMILAR GROWTH TO OCCUR IN FISCAL 2005.

ITEM 7

WE BELIEVE THAT PC UNIT SHIPMENTS WILL GROW 7% TO 9%, RESULTING IN A

FORECASTED FISCAL 2005 CLIENT REVENUE GROWTH RATE THAT WE BELIEVE WILL BE BETWEEN 5% AND 7%.

WE CONTINUE TO WATCH THE EVOLUTION OF OPEN SOURCE

SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT AND DISTRIBUTION, AND CONTINUE TO DIFFERENTIATE OUR PRODUCTS FROM COMPETITIVE PRODUCTS INCLUDING THOSE BASED ON OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE. WE BELIEVE THAT MICROSOFTS SHARE OF SERVER UNITS GREW MODESTLY IN FISCAL 2004, WHILE

LINUX DISTRIBUTIONS ROSE SLIGHTLY FASTER ON AN ABSOLUTE BASIS. THE INCREASE IN LINUX DISTRIBUTIONS REFLECTS SOME SIGNIFICANT PUBLIC ANNOUNCEMENTS OF SUPPORT AND ADOPTION OF OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE IN BOTH THE SERVER AND DESKTOP MARKETS IN THE LAST

YEAR. TO THE EXTENT OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE PRODUCTS GAIN INCREASING MARKET ACCEPTANCE, SALES OF OUR PRODUCTS MAY DECLINE, WHICH COULD RESULT IN A REDUCTION IN OUR REVENUE AND OPERATING MARGINS.

ADDITIONALLY, DUE PRIMARILY TO OUR ANNOUNCED SPECIAL DIVIDEND AND QUARTERLY DIVIDEND PAYMENTS, IF CONTINUED, WE EXPECT INVESTMENT BALANCES AND RESULTING INVESTMENT

INCOME TO DECREASE SIGNIFICANTLY IN FISCAL 2005.

WE HAVE APPROXIMATELY $1.1 BILLION IN ORIGINAL UPGRADE ADVANTAGE CONTRACT VALUE THAT WILL REACH

THEIR EXPIRATION DATES IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2005. THIS REVENUE WAS RECOGNIZED OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS AND IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2005 THE CONTRACT PERIOD EXPIRES.

OUR REVENUE GROWTH FOR FISCAL 2004 WAS DRIVEN BY

LICENSING OF WINDOWS CLIENT OPERATING SYSTEMS THROUGH OEMS; WINDOWS SERVER OPERATING SYSTEMS, OFFICE, AND OTHER SERVER APPLICATIONS AS A RESULT OF GROWTH IN PC AND SERVER HARDWARE SHIPMENTS; AND THE CONTINUING IMPACT FROM MULTI-YEAR LICENSING THAT

OCCURRED PRIOR TO THE TRANSITION TO OUR LICENSING 6.0 PROGRAM IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2003. WE ESTIMATE GROWTH IN PC SHIPMENTS WAS 13% DURING FISCAL 2004, REFLECTING GLOBAL ECONOMIC IMPROVEMENT, WHICH LED TO STRENGTH IN THE CONSUMER SEGMENT

IN THE FIRST HALF OF FISCAL 2004 AND TO REPLACEMENT PC AND NOTEBOOK SALES IN THE ENTERPRISE SEGMENT IN THE SECOND HALF OF FISCAL 2004. WE ESTIMATE THAT TOTAL SERVER HARDWARE SHIPMENTS GREW 16%, WITH WINDOWS SERVER SHIPMENTS GROWING FASTER THAN THE

OVERALL SECTOR AT 18% IN FISCAL 2004. THE NET IMPACT OF FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES ON REVENUE WAS POSITIVE IN FISCAL 2004, PRIMARILY DUE TO A RELATIVE STRENGTHENING OF MOST FOREIGN CURRENCIES VERSUS THE U.S. DOLLAR. HAD THE RATES FROM THE PRIOR YEAR

BEEN IN EFFECT IN FISCAL 2004, TRANSLATED INTERNATIONAL REVENUE EARNED IN LOCAL CURRENCIES WOULD HAVE BEEN APPROXIMATELY $1.10 BILLION LOWER. WE HEDGE A PORTION OF OUR INTERNATIONAL CURRENCY EXPOSURES, THEREBY REDUCING OUR OVERALL TRANSLATION

EXPOSURE. PRIOR TO THE JULY 31, 2002 LICENSING 6.0 TRANSITION DATE, WE EXPERIENCED A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN MULTI-YEAR LICENSING ARRANGEMENTS AS CUSTOMERS ENROLLED IN OUR MAINTENANCE PROGRAMS, PRIMARILY UPGRADE ADVANTAGE. REVENUE GROWTH IN FISCAL

2003 WAS DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY MULTI-YEAR LICENSING THAT OCCURRED BEFORE THE LICENSING 6.0 TRANSITION DATE IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2003. THE REVENUE GROWTH ALSO REFLECTED A $933 MILLION OR 13% INCREASE ASSOCIATED WITH OEM LICENSING OF MICROSOFT

WINDOWS OPERATING SYSTEMS AND A $309 MILLION OR 23% INCREASE IN REVENUE FROM MICROSOFT XBOX VIDEO GAME CONSOLES. REVENUE GROWTH IN FISCAL 2002 WAS LED BY THE ADDITION OF $1.35 BILLION OF XBOX VIDEO GAME SYSTEM REVENUE AND $1.20 BILLION OF REVENUE

GROWTH FROM MICROSOFT WINDOWS XP PROFESSIONAL AND HOME OPERATING SYSTEMS.

FOR FISCAL 2004, THE OPERATING INCOME DECLINE OF $511 MILLION WAS PRIMARILY

CAUSED BY THE $2.53 BILLION OF CHARGES RELATED TO THE SUN MICROSYSTEMS SETTLEMENT AND A FINE IMPOSED BY THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2004 AND $2.21 BILLION OF STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE RELATED TO OUR EMPLOYEE STOCK

OPTION TRANSFER PROGRAM IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2004. OPERATING INCOME WAS POSITIVELY INFLUENCED BY THE REVENUE GROWTH DESCRIBED ABOVE AND OPERATIONAL IMPROVEMENTS IN OUR MSN BUSINESS. IN FISCAL 2003, THE GROWTH IN OPERATING INCOME REFLECTED

AN INCREASE OF $3.82 BILLION IN REVENUE, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE OF $2.55 BILLION IN OPERATING EXPENSES, PRIMARILY RELATED TO EMPLOYEE AND RELATED COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH ADDITIONAL HEADCOUNT AND INCREASED LEGAL SETTLEMENT EXPENSES, PRIMARILY

THE TIME WARNER SETTLEMENT CHARGE OF $750 MILLION. IN FISCAL 2002, THE GROWTH IN OPERATING INCOME REFLECTED AN INCREASE OF $3.07 BILLION IN REVENUE, SUBSTANTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE OF $3.14 BILLION IN OPERATING EXPENSES, WHICH INCLUDED THE ONSET

OF COSTS RELATED TO XBOX VIDEO GAME SYSTEMS.

WE ADOPTED THE FAIR VALUE RECOGNITION PROVISIONS OF SFAS 123,

ACCOUNTING FOR STOCK-BASED

COMPENSATION

, ON JULY 1, 2003 AND RESTATED PRIOR PERIODS TO REFLECT COMPENSATION COST UNDER THE RECOGNITION PROVISIONS OF SFAS 123 FOR

ALL AWARDS GRANTED TO EMPLOYEES AFTER JULY 1, 1995. STOCK-BASED

COMPENSATION EXPENSES ARE INCLUDED IN OPERATING EXPENSES AS PART OF HEADCOUNT-RELATED COSTS. TOTAL STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION COSTS INCLUDED IN OPERATING EXPENSES WERE $5.73 BILLION IN FISCAL 2004, $3.75 BILLION IN FISCAL 2003, AND $3.78 BILLION IN

FISCAL 2002.

IN FISCAL 2005, WE DO NOT EXPECT REVENUE TO GROW AT SIMILARLY HIGH RATES AS FISCAL 2004, EVEN IF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SPENDING

CONTINUES TO IMPROVE. WHILE WE EXPECT GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS TO REMAIN STABLE WITH THE IMPROVEMENTS SEEN IN THE SECOND HALF OF FISCAL 2004, WE EXPECT PC AND SERVER UNIT SHIPMENT GROWTH RATES TO DECLINE IN FISCAL 2005 FROM THE HIGH GROWTH RATES

IN FISCAL 2004. WE ESTIMATE PC SHIPMENTS WILL GROW FROM 7% TO 9% AND SERVER UNIT SHIPMENTS WILL GROW FROM 13% TO 15% IN FISCAL 2005 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2004. THESE LOWER GROWTH RATES MAY CAUSE SLOWER REVENUE GROWTH IN FISCAL 2005. WE ARE ANTICIPATING

LITTLE OR NO YEAR-OVER-YEAR FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATE BENEFIT IN FISCAL 2005.

WE ANTICIPATE THAT WE WILL RENEW BETWEEN 10% AND 30% OF THE EXPIRING

UPGRADE ADVANTAGE PROGRAM REVENUE THROUGH CONVERSIONS TO SOFTWARE ASSURANCE OR MIGRATION TO ENTERPRISE AGREEMENTS. TOTAL REVENUE EXPECTED TO BE RECOGNIZED IN OUR INFORMATION WORKER, SERVER AND TOOLS, AND CLIENT BUSINESSES FROM PREVIOUSLY DEFERRED

UPGRADE ADVANTAGE REVENUE IS $56 MILLION.

MSN HAD A STRONG YEAR IN FISCAL 2004 WITH REVENUE GROWTH OF 13% DRIVEN BY OVER 40% GROWTH IN ADVERTISING

REVENUE. IN FISCAL 2005, WE EXPECT MSN TO SEE GROWTH IN ADVERTISING REVENUE AND SUBSCRIPTION AND TRANSACTION REVENUE FROM PREMIUM WEB SERVICES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A REDUCTION IN ACCESS REVENUE AS NARROWBAND SUBSCRIBERS CONTINUE TO DECLINE.

ACCORDINGLY, WE DO NOT EXPECT THE SAME LEVEL OF REVENUE GROWTH FOR MSN IN FISCAL 2005.

HOME AND ENTERTAINMENT REVENUE GREW MODERATELY IN FISCAL 2004.

WE DO NOT EXPECT SIGNIFICANT GROWTH IN HOME AND ENTERTAINMENT IN FISCAL 2005 AS PRICE REDUCTIONS IN THE SECOND HALF OF FISCAL 2004 RELATED TO THE LATE STAGE OF THE XBOX LIFECYCLE ARE EXPECTED TO LEAD TO LOWER REVENUE FOR THE XBOX BUSINESS.

WE EXPECT OUR OPERATING INCOME GROWTH IN FISCAL 2005 TO EXCEED OUR REVENUE GROWTH. OPERATING INCOME IS EXPECTED TO REFLECT LOWER OPERATING EXPENSES

DUE TO THE ABSENCE OF CERTAIN LEGAL SETTLEMENTS WHICH OCCURRED IN FISCAL 2004, LOWER STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION COSTS, AND BENEFITS ACHIEVED THROUGH CONTINUED PROGRESS IN OUR PREVIOUSLY ANNOUNCED COST EFFICACY INITIATIVE. WE EXPECT THAT OUR SEGMENTS

IN FISCAL 2004 THAT REPORTED A SEGMENT OPERATING LOSS  MOBILE AND EMBEDDED DEVICES, MICROSOFT BUSINESS SOLUTIONS, AND HOME AND ENTERTAINMENT  WILL MAKE SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS TOWARD SEGMENT PROFITABILITY IN FISCAL 2005

WITH IMPROVED OPERATIONS.

CLIENT INCLUDES REVENUE FROM WINDOWS XP PROFESSIONAL AND HOME, WINDOWS

2000 PROFESSIONAL, AND OTHER STANDARD WINDOWS OPERATING SYSTEMS. THE GROWTH OF THE CLIENT SEGMENTS REVENUE IS LARGELY CORRELATED WITH THE GROWTH OF PURCHASES OF PCS FROM OEMS THAT PRE-INSTALL VERSIONS OF WINDOWS OPERATING SYSTEMS.

CLIENT REVENUE INCREASE WAS DRIVEN BY A 14% GROWTH IN OEM LICENSES AND 16% GROWTH IN OEM REVENUE ON INCREASED CONSUMER PC UNIT SHIPMENTS IN THE FIRST HALF OF THE

FISCAL YEAR AND GROWTH IN BUSINESS PC UNIT SHIPMENTS IN THE SECOND HALF OF FISCAL 2004. REVENUE FROM COMMERCIAL AND RETAIL LICENSING DECLINED 4% DUE TO LOWER REVENUE EARNED FROM UPGRADE ADVANTAGE LICENSING AGREEMENTS AND LOWER PACKAGED PRODUCT

SALES. IN FISCAL 2003, CLIENT REVENUE GROWTH WAS DRIVEN BY OEM LICENSING REVENUE GROWTH OF $933 MILLION AND A 9 PERCENTAGE POINT INCREASE IN THE MIX OF THE HIGHER PRICED WINDOWS PROFESSIONAL OPERATING SYSTEMS, THE MAJORITY OF WHICH WAS IN THE OEM

CHANNEL. WINDOWS PROFESSIONAL REVENUE GROWTH FOR FISCAL 2003 WAS $1.59 BILLION, OR 31%, COMPARED TO FISCAL 2002. THE WINDOWS PROFESSIONAL GROWTH IN FISCAL 2003 WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A $573 MILLION DECLINE IN REVENUE FROM EARLIER VERSIONS OF

WINDOWS OPERATING SYSTEMS.

CLIENT OPERATING INCOME WAS FLAT FOR FISCAL 2004 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2003 DUE TO INCREASED OPERATING EXPENSES PRIMARILY

RELATED TO THE CHARGE FOR THE SUN MICROSYSTEMS SETTLEMENT OF $700 MILLION IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2004 AND $307 MILLION OF STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE FROM THE EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTION TRANSFER PROGRAM IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2004,

OFFSET BY GROWTH IN REVENUE. OPERATING INCOME FOR FISCAL 2003 INCREASED PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF THE 11% GROWTH IN REVENUE, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN OPERATING EXPENSES, LARGELY ATTRIBUTED TO HEADCOUNT ADDITIONS AND RELATED COSTS.

WE ESTIMATE THAT PC MARKET GROWTH WILL BE FROM 7% TO 9% IN FISCAL 2005. WE EXPECT EMERGING MARKETS TO CONTINUE TO OUTPACE MATURE MARKET GROWTH RATES

AND WE EXPECT TO HOLD OUR SHARE IN THESE RESPECTIVE MARKETS. THE DIFFERENTIAL MARKET GROWTH RATE IS EXPECTED TO RESULT IN LOWER UNIT LICENSE GROWTH IN THE OEM BUSINESS AND LOWER REVENUE GROWTH, AS PIRACY CONTINUES TO BE PROBLEMATIC IN EMERGING

MARKETS, AND SIGNIFICANT PRICE CHANGES ARE NOT ANTICIPATED. WE PLAN TO CONTINUE OUR EFFORTS TO INCREASE PREMIUM PRODUCT MIX BUT EXPECT TO SEE ONLY MODEST IMPROVEMENTS IN FISCAL 2005. THE CLIENT COMMERCIAL AND RETAIL LICENSING REVENUES ARE EXPECTED

TO CONTINUE TO LAG BEHIND OVERALL CLIENT REVENUE GROWTH. WE EXPECT OPERATING PROFITS AS A PERCENTAGE OF CLIENT REVENUE TO IMPROVE IN FISCAL 2005, DUE TO THE LEGAL SETTLEMENTS EXPENSES AND STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE FROM THE EMPLOYEE STOCK

OPTION TRANSFER PROGRAM IN FISCAL 2004. MAJOR INVESTMENTS IN FISCAL 2005 INCLUDE DEVELOPMENT OF THE WINDOWS CLIENT NEXT GENERATION OPERATING SYSTEM (LONGHORN), SECURITY PROGRAMS, AND MARKETING INITIATIVES, INCLUDING THOSE RELATED TO WINDOWS XP

LICENSES AND CLIENT ACCESS LICENSES (CALS) FOR WINDOWS SERVER, SQL SERVER, EXCHANGE SERVER, AND OTHER SERVERS. IT ALSO INCLUDES DEVELOPER TOOLS, TRAINING, CERTIFICATION, MICROSOFT PRESS, PREMIER PRODUCT SUPPORT SERVICES, AND MICROSOFT CONSULTING

SERVICES. GROWTH IN THE OVERALL MARKET FOR INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY, BOTH HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE, IS THE PRINCIPAL DRIVER FOR SERVER AND TOOLS REVENUE GROWTH. THE SEGMENT CONCENTRATES ON LICENSING PRODUCTS, APPLICATIONS, TOOLS, CONTENT, AND SERVICES

THAT MAKE INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY PROFESSIONALS AND DEVELOPERS MORE PRODUCTIVE AND EFFICIENT. PRODUCTS ARE SOLD THROUGH OEMS, DISTRIBUTORS, DIRECT TO CUSTOMERS, AND THROUGH ONE-TIME LICENSES OR MULTI-YEAR VOLUME LICENSE AGREEMENTS.

WE ESTIMATE THAT OVERALL SERVER HARDWARE SHIPMENTS GREW 16% IN FISCAL 2004 COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR. SERVER AND SERVER APPLICATIONS REVENUE, INCLUDING CAL

REVENUE, GREW $1.28 BILLION OR 25% DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY AN ESTIMATED 18% INCREASE IN WINDOWS-BASED SERVER SHIPMENTS RESULTING IN 15% GROWTH IN NEW WINDOWS SERVER LICENSES, AND BY FAVORABLE CONVERSION OF REVENUE BILLED IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES TO U.S.

DOLLARS. CONSULTING AND PREMIER PRODUCT SUPPORT SERVICES REVENUE INCREASED $189 MILLION OR 19% COMPARED TO FISCAL 2003 DUE TO INCREASED CUSTOMER PENETRATION FROM NEW PRODUCT OFFERINGS. REVENUE FROM DEVELOPER TOOLS, TRAINING, CERTIFICATION, AND

MICROSOFT PRESS AND OTHER SERVICES DECLINED $128 MILLION OR 14% COMPARED TO FISCAL 2003 DUE TO RECOGNITION OF REVENUE DEFERRED IN PRIOR YEARS. FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES CONTRIBUTED APPROXIMATELY $350 MILLION OR 5% OF SERVER AND TOOLS REVENUE GROWTH.

TOTAL SERVER AND TOOLS REVENUE GREW $983 MILLION OR 16%

IN FISCAL 2003, DRIVEN BY AN INCREASE IN WINDOWS-BASED SERVER SHIPMENTS AND GROWTH IN SQL SERVER AND EXCHANGE REVENUE. WINDOWS SERVER AND CALS REVENUE GREW $787 MILLION OR 18% FROM FISCAL 2002 AS A RESULT OF INCREASED NEW AND ANNIVERSARY MULTI-YEAR

LICENSING AGREEMENTS. CONSULTING AND PREMIER PRODUCT SUPPORT SERVICES INCREASED $91 MILLION OR 10% COMPARED TO FISCAL 2002. REVENUE FROM DEVELOPER TOOLS, TRAINING, CERTIFICATION, MICROSOFT PRESS, AND OTHER SERVICES INCREASED $105 MILLION OR 13% FROM

FISCAL 2002.

SERVER AND TOOLS OPERATING INCOME FOR FISCAL 2004 DECLINED PRIMARILY DUE TO THE CHARGE FOR THE SUN MICROSYSTEMS SETTLEMENT OF $1.22

BILLION IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2004 AND $651 MILLION OF STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION COSTS FROM THE EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTION TRANSFER PROGRAM IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2004. SERVER AND TOOLS OPERATING INCOME FOR FISCAL 2003 GREW 50%,

PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF THE 16% INCREASE IN REVENUE.

WE ANTICIPATE THAT OVERALL SERVER HARDWARE SHIPMENTS WILL GROW FROM 13% TO 15% IN FISCAL 2005

AND NEW LICENSES OF WINDOWS SERVER OPERATING SYSTEM WILL GROW SLIGHTLY FASTER THAN THE OVERALL MARKET. WE BELIEVE THAT WINDOWS SERVER 2003 SHIPMENTS WILL CREATE OPPORTUNITIES FOR SALES OF WINDOWS SERVER SYSTEM PRODUCTS. HOWEVER, WE FACE STRONG

COMPETITION FROM THE LINUX-BASED, UNIX, AND OTHER SERVER OPERATING SYSTEMS. IN ADDITION, SERVER AND TOOLS NET REVENUE FOR FISCAL 2005 WILL BE UNFAVORABLY AFFECTED BY THE ABSENCE OF REVENUE EARNED FROM OUR UPGRADE ADVANTAGE PROGRAM AND NO ANTICIPATED

FOREIGN EXCHANGE BENEFIT.

INFORMATION WORKER PRODUCTS INCLUDING MICROSOFT LIVEMEETING AND ONENOTE, AND PROFESSIONAL PRODUCT SUPPORT SERVICES. MOST REVENUE FROM THIS SEGMENT COMES FROM LICENSING OUR OFFICE SYSTEM PRODUCTS. REVENUE GROWTH DEPENDS ON THE ABILITY TO ADD VALUE TO

THE CORE OFFICE PRODUCT SET AND EXPAND OUR PRODUCT OFFERINGS IN OTHER INFORMATION WORKER AREAS SUCH AS DOCUMENT LIFECYCLE AND COLLABORATION.

REVENUE

GROWTH FOR FISCAL 2004 FROM VOLUME LICENSING, RETAIL PACKAGED PRODUCT AND PRE-INSTALLED VERSIONS OF OFFICE IN JAPAN WAS 15% IN AGGREGATE. THIS INCREASE WAS DRIVEN BY RECOGNITION OF UNEARNED REVENUE PRIMARILY FROM A LARGE INCREASE IN MULTI-YEAR

LICENSES SIGNED PRIOR TO THE TRANSITION TO OUR LICENSING 6.0 PROGRAMS AND APPROXIMATELY $110 MILLION RELATED TO THE LAUNCH OF OFFICE 2003. OEM LICENSING REVENUE GREW 29% OR $325 MILLION. FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES PROVIDED APPROXIMATELY $485 MILLION OR

5% OF TOTAL INFORMATION WORKER REVENUE GROWTH. THE $1.02 BILLION OR 12% INCREASE IN REVENUE IN FISCAL 2003 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2002 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO GROWTH IN OFFICE SUITES REVENUE ASSOCIATED WITH NEW AND ANNIVERSARY MULTI-YEAR LICENSING

AGREEMENTS AND A $264 MILLION OR 28% INCREASE IN REVENUE FROM THE COMBINED TOTAL OF MICROSOFT PROJECT, MICROSOFT VISIO, AND OTHER STAND-ALONE APPLICATIONS.

INFORMATION WORKER OPERATING INCOME IN FISCAL 2004 INCREASED FROM THE PRIOR YEAR PRIMARILY DUE TO GROWTH IN REVENUE, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN OPERATING EXPENSES, PRIMARILY RELATED TO $351 MILLION OF STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION

EXPENSE FROM THE EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTION TRANSFER PROGRAM IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2004 AND HIGHER SALES AND MARKETING EXPENSES. INFORMATION WORKER OPERATING PROFIT FOR FISCAL 2003 GREW 9% COMPARED TO FISCAL 2002, LED BY THE 12% INCREASE IN

REVENUE AND PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A 20% GROWTH IN OPERATING EXPENSES RELATED TO HEADCOUNT ADDITIONS AND MARKETING EXPENSES.

FISCAL 2005 INFORMATION

WORKER REVENUE IS EXPECTED TO BE SIMILAR TO FISCAL 2004. WE ARE EXPECTING A REDUCTION IN REVENUE EARNED FROM OUR UPGRADE ADVANTAGE LICENSING AGREEMENTS AND NO ANTICIPATED FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATE BENEFIT. THE SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN UPGRADE ADVANTAGE

EARNED REVENUE IS EXPECTED TO BE OFFSET BY SUSTAINED MOMENTUM IN OUR OEM AND MULTI-YEAR LICENSING OFFERINGS AND INCREASED PURCHASING OF OFFICE SYSTEM 2003 AS ENTERPRISES COMPLETE THEIR PRODUCT EVALUATIONS.

MICROSOFT BUSINESS SOLUTIONS INCLUDES MICROSOFT

GREAT PLAINS, MICROSOFT NAVISION, MICROSOFT AXAPTA, MICROSOFT SOLOMON, MICROSOFT CRM, MBN/RETAIL MANAGER AND OTHER BUSINESS APPLICATIONS AND SERVICES. OUR REVENUE IS GENERALLY DERIVED FROM DEVELOPING AND MARKETING INTEGRATED, END-TO-END BUSINESS

APPLICATIONS AND SERVICES DESIGNED TO HELP SMALL AND MID-MARKET BUSINESSES. THE SMALL AND MID-MARKET BUSINESS APPLICATIONS MARKET IS HIGHLY FRAGMENTED AND IS INTENSELY COMPETITIVE IN ALL SECTORS. MICROSOFT BUSINESS SOLUTIONS REVENUES ARE AFFECTED BY

THE GENERAL ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT AND ENTERPRISE INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SPENDING IN PARTICULAR.

THE REVENUE INCREASE IN FISCAL 2004 WAS PRIMARILY

ATTRIBUTABLE TO CONTINUED GROWTH IN LICENSING OF NAVISION AND AXAPTA ERP PRODUCTS, AND NEW SALES OF MICROSOFT CRM. MICROSOFT BUSINESS SOLUTIONS REVENUE FOR FISCAL 2003 GREW $259 MILLION FROM FISCAL 2002, OF WHICH $246 MILLION WAS ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE

ACQUISITION OF NAVISION AT THE BEGINNING OF THE FISCAL YEAR.

THE OPERATING LOSS FOR FISCAL 2004 DECLINED FROM FISCAL 2003 DUE TO THE INCREASE IN

REVENUE AND LOWER OPERATING EXPENSES INCLUDING $42 MILLION OF LOWER AMORTIZATION COSTS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY $27 MILLION IN STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE FROM THE EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTION TRANSFER PROGRAM IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2004.

MICROSOFT BUSINESS SOLUTIONS OPERATING LOSS FOR FISCAL 2003 INCREASED FROM FISCAL 2002 PRIMARILY DUE TO OPERATING LOSSES ASSOCIATED WITH NAVISION, INCREASES IN SALES AND MARKETING EXPENSES, RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES, AND ACQUISITION-RELATED

COSTS.

WE ANNOUNCED IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF FISCAL 2004 A PLAN TO ALIGN AND INCLUDE THE SMALL AND MID-MARKET SOLUTIONS & PARTNERS (SMS&P)

ORGANIZATION IN THE MICROSOFT BUSINESS SOLUTIONS SEGMENT. THIS CHANGE IS DESIGNED TO OPTIMIZE OUR FOCUS ON DELIVERING BUSINESS APPLICATIONS TO SMALL AND MID-MARKET SEGMENT BUSINESSES. THE SMS&P ORGANIZATION IS CURRENTLY PART OF THE INFORMATION

WORKER SEGMENT. THIS REORGANIZATION WILL RESULT IN A CORRESPONDING CHANGE TO THE MICROSOFT BUSINESS SOLUTIONS AND INFORMATION WORKER REPORTED RESULTS, PRIMARILY FROM THE REORGANIZATION OF APPROXIMATELY $100 MILLION IN REVENUE AND COSTS ASSOCIATED

WITH OUR PARTNER PROGRAM OFFERINGS, WHICH WILL MOVE FROM INFORMATION WORKER SEGMENT TO MICROSOFT BUSINESS SOLUTIONS. IN FISCAL 2005, WE EXPECT CONTINUED GROWTH FOR MICROSOFT BUSINESS SOLUTIONS THROUGH CRM, AXAPTA, NAVISION, AND GREAT PLAINS PRODUCT

LINES WITH INCREASED SALES AND MARKETING FOCUS FROM THE SMS&P ORGANIZATION, AND NEW PRODUCT LAUNCHES FOR GREAT PLAINS AND NAVISION.

ACCESS, AND MSN PREMIUM WEB SERVICES. REVENUE IS PRINCIPALLY GENERATED FROM ADVERTISERS ON MSN, FROM CONSUMERS THROUGH SUBSCRIPTIONS AND TRANSACTIONS GENERATED FROM MSN PREMIUM WEB SERVICES AND FROM SUBSCRIBERS TO MSN NARROWBAND INTERNET ACCESS.

IN FISCAL 2004, MSN ADVERTISING REVENUE INCREASED $360 MILLION OR 43% AS A RESULT OF GROWTH IN PAID SEARCH AND GROWTH IN THE OVERALL INTERNET

ADVERTISING MARKET. THIS INCREASE WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECLINE OF $168 MILLION OR 15% IN INTERNET ACCESS REVENUE, PRIMARILY FROM THE MIGRATION OF INTERNET ACCESS SUBSCRIBERS TO BROADBAND OR OTHER COMPETITIVELY PRICED INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDERS.

REVENUE FROM SUBSCRIPTION AND TRANSACTION SERVICES OTHER THAN INTERNET ACCESS INCREASED $71 MILLION IN FISCAL 2004 TO $95 MILLION. AT THE END OF THE CURRENT FISCAL YEAR, MSN HAD 4.3 MILLION INTERNET ACCESS SUBSCRIBERS COMPARED TO 6.5 MILLION AT THE

END OF THE PRIOR FISCAL YEAR AND 8.8 MILLION TOTAL SUBSCRIBERS COMPARED TO 8.6 MILLION AT THE END OF THE PRIOR YEAR. IN ADDITION, MSN HAS OVER 350 MILLION UNIQUE USERS

MONTHLY, 187 MILLION ACTIVE HOTMAIL ACCOUNTS, AND 135 MILLION ACTIVE

MESSENGER ACCOUNTS. COMPARED TO FISCAL 2002, MSN ADVERTISING REVENUE GREW $270 MILLION OR 48% IN FISCAL 2003 AS A RESULT OF GROWTH IN PAID SEARCH AND STRONG ONLINE ADVERTISING SALES ACROSS ALL GEOGRAPHIC REGIONS. MSN SUBSCRIPTION REVENUE GREW $112

MILLION OR 11% IN FISCAL 2003 REFLECTING AN INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF PAYING NON-PROMOTION SUBSCRIBERS.

MSN REACHED SEGMENT PROFITABILITY IN

THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2004 AND WAS PROFITABLE FOR THE FULL FISCAL YEAR. THE IMPROVEMENT IN PROFITABILITY WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY AN INCREASE IN REVENUE FROM ADVERTISING IN BOTH DISPLAY AND PAID SEARCH, A DECLINE IN CUSTOMER ACQUISITION COSTS

AND OTHER EXPENSES RELATED TO THE INTERNET ACCESS BUSINESS, EFFICIENCY GAINS IN THE OPERATIONS OF THE ADVERTISING AND SUBSCRIPTION BUSINESSES, AND A $48 MILLION REFUND OF PRIOR YEAR TAXES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY $144 MILLION OF STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION

EXPENSE RELATED TO THE EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTION TRANSFER PROGRAM IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2004. MSN OPERATING LOSS FOR FISCAL 2003 DECREASED FROM FISCAL 2002, PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF THE GROWTH IN REVENUE AND LOWER RELATIVE SUBSCRIPTION

ACQUISITION AND SUPPORT COSTS.

MSN EXPECTS ADVERTISING REVENUE AND REVENUE FROM SUBSCRIPTIONS AND TRANSACTIONS FOR PREMIUM WEB SERVICES TO INCREASE

IN FISCAL 2005. ADVERTISING REVENUE SHOULD BENEFIT FROM EXPECTED INCREASES IN INTERNET SPENDING AND ADDITIONS TO THE ADVERTISING PLATFORM INCLUDING MUSIC DOWNLOAD SERVICE, COMMUNICATION INNOVATIONS, AND AN IMPROVED SEARCH ENGINE. WE EXPECT REVENUE

FROM NARROWBAND INTERNET ACCESS TO DECLINE IN FISCAL 2005 AS NARROWBAND SUBSCRIBERS CONTINUE TO MIGRATE TO BROADBAND INTERNET ACCESS. WE ANNOUNCED IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF FISCAL 2004 AN INCREASE TO THE AMOUNT OF STORAGE WE WILL PROVIDE FOR SELECT

MSN AND HOTMAIL EMAIL ACCOUNTS WHICH WILL INCREASE OPERATING COSTS AND MAY IMPACT THE REVENUES FROM OUR EXTRA STORAGE CUSTOMERS. HOWEVER, WE EXPECT THE SEGMENT TO INCREASE ITS PROFITABILITY IN FISCAL 2005, LED BY CONTINUED OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCIES

AND LOWER UNIT MARGIN COSTS IN BOTH THE SUBSCRIBER AND ADVERTISING BUSINESSES.

MOBILE AND EMBEDDED DEVICES INCLUDES WINDOWS

MOBILE SOFTWARE, WINDOWS EMBEDDED DEVICE OPERATING SYSTEMS, MAPPOINT, AND WINDOWS AUTOMOTIVE. THE SEGMENTS PRODUCTS EXTEND THE ADVANTAGES OF THE WINDOWS PLATFORM TO MOBILE PHONES AND POCKET PCS. THE SEGMENT IS ALSO RESPONSIBLE FOR MANAGING

SALES AND CUSTOMER RELATIONS WITH DEVICE MANUFACTURERS AND WITH NETWORK SERVICE PROVIDERS, INCLUDING TELECOMMUNICATIONS, CABLE AND WIRELESS COMPANIES, AND HOST AND NETWORK EQUIPMENT PROVIDERS. THE EMBEDDED OPERATING SYSTEM MARKET IS HIGHLY

FRAGMENTED WITH MANY COMPETITIVE OFFERINGS AND RELATIVELY SHORT PRODUCT LIFE CYCLES THAT AFFECT OUR CONTINUING REVENUE STREAMS.

UNIT VOLUME INCREASES

DROVE REVENUE GROWTH FOR FISCAL 2004 OVER FISCAL 2003 IN ALL PRODUCT LINES. THE GROWTH WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF OEMS AND MOBILE OPERATORS SHIPPING WINDOWS MOBILE SOFTWARE FOR SMARTPHONES, INCREASES IN MARKET SHARE FOR OUR

POCKET PC AND EMBEDDED PRODUCTS AND INCREASED USAGE BY EXISTING CUSTOMERS OF OUR MAPPOINT WEB SERVICE. REVENUE FOR FISCAL 2003 GREW $44 MILLION DRIVEN BY INCREASED POCKET PC SHIPMENTS AND MAPPOINT LICENSING.

MOBILE AND EMBEDDED DEVICES OPERATING LOSS FOR FISCAL 2004 DECREASED COMPARED TO FISCAL 2003 PRIMARILY DUE TO GROWTH IN REVENUE AND LOWER MARKETING EXPENSES,

PARTIALLY OFFSET BY $58 MILLION OF STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE FROM THE EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTION TRANSFER PROGRAM IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2004. OPERATING LOSS FOR FISCAL 2003 GREW 1% FROM THE PRIOR YEAR AS HIGHER MARKETING EXPENSES AND

HEADCOUNT-RELATED COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT OFFSET THE GROWTH IN REVENUE.

WE EXPECT DEMAND FOR MOBILE AND EMBEDDED DEVICES BASED ON

WINDOWS MOBILE SOFTWARE TO BE DRIVEN BY AN OVERALL INCREASE IN CUSTOMER DEMAND FOR CONNECTIVITY AS WELL AS BY AN INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF OEMS AND MOBILE OPERATORS OFFERING WINDOWS-BASED DEVICES.

HOME AND ENTERTAINMENT INCLUDES THE MICROSOFT

XBOX VIDEO GAME CONSOLE SYSTEM, PC GAMES, THE HOME PRODUCTS DIVISION (HPD), AND TV PLATFORM PRODUCTS FOR THE INTERACTIVE TELEVISION INDUSTRY. THE RELATIVE SUCCESS OF COMPETING VIDEO GAME CONSOLES IS DETERMINED BY CONSOLE FUNCTIONALITY, THE PORTFOLIO

OF VIDEO GAME CONTENT FOR THE CONSOLE, AND THE RELATIVE MARKET SHARE OF THE CONSOLE. WE ARE A RELATIVELY NEW ENTRANT IN THE VIDEO GAME CONSOLE BUSINESSES WITH OUR FIRST RELEASE IN FISCAL 2002, AND HAVE ESTABLISHED OURSELVES AS ONE OF THE LEADERS.

REVENUE AND UNIT VOLUMES HAVE GROWN QUICKLY SINCE 2002, BUT REVENUE GROWTH MODERATED IN FISCAL 2004 DUE TO PRICE REDUCTIONS TYPICAL AT THIS STAGE IN THE CONSOLE LIFECYCLE. WE BELIEVE OUR COMPETITIVE POSITION AND REVENUE IS BOLSTERED BY OUR

INCREASING SOFTWARE GAME ATTACH RATES, PROVIDING HIGHER MARGINS TO OFFSET THE DECREASING PRICE TREND ON CONSOLES SOLD.

IN FISCAL 2004, XBOX REVENUE

INCREASED $144 MILLION OR 9% WITH $269 MILLION RELATED TO HIGHER XBOX SOFTWARE VOLUMES AND $117 MILLION DUE TO HIGHER XBOX CONSOLE VOLUMES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A $242 MILLION DECLINE RELATED TO PRICE REDUCTIONS OF XBOX CONSOLES AND SOFTWARE.

OVERALL, XBOX CONSOLE VOLUMES INCREASED 11% IN FISCAL 2004 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2003. THE XBOX LIFE-TO-DATE U.S. GAMES ATTACH RATE INCREASED TO 6.9 GAMES PER CONSOLE ACCORDING TO INDUSTRY ANALYST NPD AS OF JUNE 30, 2004. REVENUE FROM CONSUMER HARDWARE

AND SOFTWARE, PC GAMES AND TV PLATFORMS DECLINED $16 MILLION OR 1% COMPARED TO FISCAL 2003 DUE TO LOWER PC GAMES SOFTWARE AND PC GAMING DEVICES SALES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE NEW RELEASE OF MAC OFFICE. THE INCREASE IN HOME AND ENTERTAINMENT REVENUE

IN FISCAL 2003 FROM FISCAL 2002 WAS THE RESULT OF SALES OF XBOX VIDEO GAME SYSTEMS AND RELATED GAMES WHICH WERE AVAILABLE FOR ALL OF FISCAL 2003. XBOX REVENUE GREW $309 MILLION OR 23% IN FISCAL 2003 REFLECTING A $779 MILLION INCREASE FROM HIGHER

VOLUMES FOR XBOX CONSOLES, GAMES, AND PERIPHERALS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A $470 MILLION DECREASE DUE TO PRICE CHANGES. REVENUE FROM CONSUMER HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE AND PC GAMES DECLINED $14 MILLION OR 1% IN FISCAL 2003, DRIVING THE DECREASE IN HOME

PRODUCTS REVENUE.

THE INCREASE IN OPERATING LOSS IN FISCAL 2004 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO $141 MILLION OF STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE FROM THE

EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTION TRANSFER PROGRAM IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2004, INCREASED SALES OF NEGATIVE MARGIN CONSOLES, AND COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE NEXT GENERATION CONSOLE DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY INCREASED XBOX AND MAC OFFICE

SOFTWARE SALES. THE OPERATING LOSS INCREASE FROM FISCAL 2003 ALSO INCLUDED A LOWER OF COST OR MARKET ADJUSTMENT OF APPROXIMATELY $90 MILLION, REFLECTING THE CURRENT STAGE IN THE LIFECYCLE OF THE XBOX CONSOLE. OPERATING LOSS IN 2003 INCREASED BY $56

MILLION OR 5% FROM THE PRIOR YEAR AS THE PRODUCT COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE INCREASED XBOX CONSOLE SALES AND INCREASED MARKETING EXPENSE MORE THAN OFFSET THE 12% INCREASE IN REVENUE.

IN FISCAL 2005, WE EXPECT XBOX CONSOLE UNIT VOLUMES AND REVENUE TO DECREASE FROM FISCAL 2004 CONSISTENT WITH THIS STAGE OF THE XBOX CONSOLE LIFECYCLE, PARTIALLY

OFFSET BY INCREASED UNIT VOLUMES DRIVEN BY THE LAUNCH OF SOFTWARE TITLES SUCH AS HALO2. IN FISCAL 2005 WE EXPECT PC GAMES REVENUE TO DECREASE FROM FISCAL 2004 DRIVEN BY FEWER NEW GAME TITLES. OTHER HPD REVENUE ARE EXPECTED TO INCREASE MODERATELY AS

A RESULT OF THE LAUNCH OF THE LATEST VERSION OF MAC OFFICE LATE IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF FISCAL 2004. IN FISCAL 2005, WE EXPECT OPERATING MARGINS TO IMPROVE FROM FISCAL 2004 DRIVEN BY LOWER UNIT VOLUMES OF NEGATIVE MARGIN CONSOLES AND INCREASED

SALES OF HIGH MARGIN SOFTWARE. WE EXPECT DEVELOPMENT SPENDING TO BE HIGHER IN FISCAL 2005 DRIVEN BY INVESTMENT IN THE NEXT GENERATION XBOX PLATFORM DESIGN.

COST OF REVENUE INCLUDES MANUFACTURING AND DISTRIBUTION COSTS FOR

PRODUCTS AND PROGRAMS SOLD, OPERATING COSTS RELATED TO PRODUCT SUPPORT SERVICE CENTERS AND PRODUCT DISTRIBUTION CENTERS, COSTS INCURRED TO SUPPORT AND MAINTAIN INTERNET-BASED PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, AND COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE DELIVERY OF

CONSULTING SERVICES. THE INCREASE IN FISCAL 2004 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASED PRODUCT SUPPORT AND CONSULTING SERVICES COSTS OF $508 MILLION, $214 MILLION OF STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE FROM THE EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTION TRANSFER PROGRAM, AND A

LOWER OF COST OR MARKET ADJUSTMENT IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF FISCAL 2004 BY APPROXIMATELY $90 MILLION, REFLECTING THE CURRENT STAGE OF THE LIFE CYCLE OF THE XBOX CONSOLE, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY $365 MILLION DECREASE IN MSN SERVICES COSTS. IN FISCAL

2003, THE PRIMARY DRIVER OF THE INCREASE WAS A 4.4 PERCENTAGE POINT INCREASE FROM HOME AND ENTERTAINMENT PRODUCTS AND A 1.6 PERCENTAGE POINT DECREASE FROM MSN PRODUCT AND SERVICE COSTS IN FISCAL 2003 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2002.

PORTFOLIO. NET RECOGNIZED GAINS (LOSSES) ON INVESTMENTS INCLUDE OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENTS OF $82 MILLION IN FISCAL 2004 COMPARED TO $1.15 BILLION IN THE PRIOR YEAR AS WELL AS HIGHER NET REALIZED GAINS ON SALES IN FISCAL 2004 AS WE MOVED TO

MORE LIQUID INVESTMENT ASSET CLASSES. NET REALIZED GAINS ON SALES WERE $1.65 BILLION IN FISCAL 2004 AND $1.19 BILLION IN FISCAL 2003. THE DECLINE IN IMPAIRMENTS WAS DUE TO IMPROVED MARKET CONDITIONS. DERIVATIVE LOSSES DECREASED $156 MILLION TO $268

MILLION IN FISCAL 2004 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2003 PRIMARILY DUE TO THE COMBINED EFFECTS OF INTEREST RATE MOVEMENTS ON INTEREST RATE SENSITIVE INSTRUMENTS AND EQUITY MARKET PRICE MOVEMENTS RELATIVE TO POSITIONS USED TO HEDGE THE FAIR VALUE OF CERTAIN

EQUITY SECURITIES.

IN FISCAL 2003, DIVIDENDS AND INTEREST INCOME DECREASED $162 MILLION DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY A REDUCTION IN DIVIDEND INCOME OF $97

MILLION RESULTING FROM THE EXCHANGE OF AT&T 5% CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED DEBT FOR COMMON SHARES OF COMCAST DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2003, AND DECLINING INTEREST RATES PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A LARGER INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO. NET RECOGNIZED GAINS

(LOSSES) ON INVESTMENTS INCLUDES OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENTS OF $1.15 BILLION IN FISCAL 2003 COMPARED TO $4.32 BILLION IN FISCAL 2002 AND NET REALIZED GAINS ON INVESTMENTS OF $1.19 BILLION IN FISCAL 2003 COMPARED TO $2.52 BILLION IN FISCAL

2002. THE DECREASE IN OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENTS IN 2003 WAS ALSO DUE TO THE REDUCED COST-BASIS OF INVESTMENTS RESULTING FROM SIGNIFICANT 2002 IMPAIRMENTS OF INVESTMENTS IN THE CABLE AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS SECTORS.

IN FISCAL 2002, OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENTS OF $4.32 BILLION PRIMARILY RELATED TO OUR INVESTMENT IN AT&T AND OTHER CABLE AND TELECOMMUNICATION INVESTMENTS.

NET REALIZED GAINS ON THE SALES OF INVESTMENTS OF $2.52 BILLION INCLUDED A $1.25 BILLION GAIN ON SALE OF OUR INTEREST IN EXPEDIA.

INVESTMENTS ARE

CONSIDERED TO BE IMPAIRED WHEN A DECLINE IN FAIR VALUE IS JUDGED TO BE OTHER THAN TEMPORARY. WE EMPLOY A SYSTEMATIC METHODOLOGY THAT CONSIDERS AVAILABLE EVIDENCE IN EVALUATING POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT OF OUR INVESTMENTS. IF THE COST OF AN INVESTMENT

EXCEEDS ITS FAIR VALUE, WE EVALUATE, AMONG OTHER FACTORS, GENERAL MARKET CONDITIONS, THE DURATION AND EXTENT TO WHICH THE FAIR VALUE IS LESS THAN COST, AND OUR INTENT AND ABILITY TO HOLD THE INVESTMENT. WE ALSO CONSIDER SPECIFIC ADVERSE CONDITIONS

RELATED TO THE FINANCIAL HEALTH OF AND BUSINESS OUTLOOK FOR THE INVESTEE, INCLUDING INDUSTRY AND SECTOR PERFORMANCE, CHANGES IN TECHNOLOGY, OPERATIONAL AND FINANCING CASH FLOW FACTORS, AND RATING AGENCY ACTIONS. ONCE A DECLINE IN FAIR VALUE IS

DETERMINED TO BE OTHER THAN TEMPORARY, AN IMPAIRMENT CHARGE IS RECORDED AND A NEW COST BASIS IN THE INVESTMENT IS ESTABLISHED.

INCOME TAXES

OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR FISCAL 2004 WAS 33%. A BENEFIT OF $208 MILLION WAS RECORDED DURING THE

FOURTH QUARTER FROM THE REVERSAL OF PREVIOUSLY ACCRUED TAXES FROM RESOLVING THE REMAINING OPEN ISSUE REMANDED BY THE 9TH CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS RULING IN DECEMBER 2002. THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR THE FOURTH QUARTER OF FISCAL 2004 WAS APPROXIMATELY

27%. DURING THE THIRD QUARTER THE TAX RATE INCREASED DUE TO THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION FINE, WHICH IS NOT TAX DEDUCTIBLE.

THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR

FISCAL 2003 AND FISCAL 2002 WAS 32% EACH YEAR. THE FISCAL 2003 RATE REFLECTED A BENEFIT IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF $126 MILLION FROM THE REVERSAL OF PREVIOUSLY ACCRUED TAXES RELATED TO THE INITIAL ITEMS FROM THE 9TH CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS RULING

REFERRED TO ABOVE, THAT REVERSED, IN PART, A PREVIOUS TAX COURT RULING THAT HAD DENIED TAX BENEFITS ON CERTAIN REVENUE EARNED FROM THE DISTRIBUTION OF SOFTWARE TO FOREIGN CUSTOMERS. EXCLUDING THIS REVERSAL, THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE WOULD HAVE BEEN

33%.

STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION.

WE IMPLEMENTED CHANGES IN

FISCAL 2004 IN EMPLOYEE COMPENSATION DESIGNED TO HELP US CONTINUE TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN THE BEST EMPLOYEES, AND TO BETTER ALIGN EMPLOYEE INTERESTS WITH THOSE OF OUR SHAREHOLDERS. GENERALLY, EMPLOYEES ARE NOW GRANTED STOCK AWARDS INSTEAD OF STOCK

OPTIONS. THE STOCK AWARD PROGRAM OFFERS EMPLOYEES THE OPPORTUNITY TO EARN SHARES OF OUR STOCK OVER TIME, RATHER THAN OPTIONS THAT GIVE EMPLOYEES THE RIGHT TO PURCHASE STOCK AT A SET PRICE. WE ALSO COMPLETED AN EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTION TRANSFER PROGRAM

IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2004 WHEREBY EMPLOYEES COULD ELECT TO TRANSFER ALL OF THEIR VESTED AND UNVESTED STOCK OPTIONS WITH A STRIKE PRICE OF $33 OR HIGHER (ELIGIBLE OPTIONS) TO JPMORGAN CHASE BANK (JPMORGAN). THE UNVESTED

ELIGIBLE OPTIONS THAT WERE TRANSFERRED TO JPMORGAN BECAME VESTED UPON THE TRANSFER. THE PRICE PAID BY JPMORGAN FOR THE TRANSFERRED OPTIONS WAS DETERMINED BY REFERENCE TO THE ARITHMETIC AVERAGE OF THE CLOSING PRICES OF MICROSOFT COMMON STOCK DURING

THE PERIOD FROM NOVEMBER 14, 2003 TO DECEMBER 8, 2003, WHICH WAS $25.5720. NOTE 13  EMPLOYEE STOCK AND SAVINGS PLAN OF THE NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS PROVIDES ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON EMPLOYEE STOCK AND SAVINGS PLANS.

IN ADDITION, EFFECTIVE JULY 1, 2003, WE ADOPTED THE FAIR VALUE RECOGNITION PROVISIONS OF SFAS 123,

ACCOUNTING FOR STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION

,

USING THE RETROACTIVE RESTATEMENT METHOD DESCRIBED IN SFAS 148,

ACCOUNTING FOR STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION  TRANSITION AND DISCLOSURE

. UNDER THE FAIR VALUE RECOGNITION PROVISIONS OF SFAS 123, STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION COST IS

MEASURED AT THE GRANT DATE BASED ON THE VALUE OF THE AWARD AND IS RECOGNIZED AS EXPENSE OVER THE VESTING PERIOD. THE JUNE 30, 2003 BALANCE SHEET HAS BEEN RESTATED FOR THE RETROACTIVE ADOPTION OF THE FAIR VALUE RECOGNITION PROVISIONS OF SFAS 123,

WHICH RESULTED IN A $13.89 BILLION INCREASE IN COMMON STOCK AND PAID-IN CAPITAL, A $10.00 BILLION DECREASE IN RETAINED EARNINGS, AND A $3.89 BILLION INCREASE IN DEFERRED INCOME TAXES.

GIVEN THESE CHANGES THE FOLLOWING TABLE PROVIDES STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE FOR FISCAL 2002 THROUGH 2004 BY SEGMENT.

FINANCIAL CONDITION

OUR CASH AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO TOTALED $60.59 BILLION AS OF JUNE 30, 2004. EQUITY AND

OTHER INVESTMENTS WERE $12.21 BILLION AS OF JUNE 30, 2004. THE PORTFOLIO CONSISTS PRIMARILY OF FIXED-INCOME SECURITIES, DIVERSIFIED AMONG INDUSTRIES AND INDIVIDUAL ISSUERS. OUR INVESTMENTS ARE GENERALLY LIQUID AND INVESTMENT GRADE. THE PORTFOLIO IS

INVESTED PREDOMINANTLY IN U.S. DOLLAR DENOMINATED SECURITIES, BUT ALSO INCLUDES FOREIGN CURRENCY POSITIONS, IN ORDER TO DIVERSIFY FINANCIAL RISK. THE PORTFOLIO IS PRIMARILY INVESTED IN SHORT-TERM SECURITIES TO MINIMIZE INTEREST RATE RISK AND

FACILITATE RAPID DEPLOYMENT FOR IMMEDIATE CASH NEEDS.

UNEARNED REVENUE FROM VOLUME LICENSING PROGRAMS REPRESENTS CUSTOMER BILLINGS, PAID EITHER

UPFRONT OR ANNUALLY AT THE BEGINNING OF EACH BILLING COVERAGE PERIOD, THAT ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AS SUBSCRIPTIONS WITH REVENUE RECOGNIZED RATABLY OVER THE BILLING COVERAGE PERIOD. FOR CERTAIN OTHER LICENSING ARRANGEMENTS REVENUE ATTRIBUTABLE TO

UNDELIVERED ELEMENTS, INCLUDING FREE POST-DELIVERY TELEPHONE SUPPORT AND THE RIGHT TO RECEIVE UNSPECIFIED UPGRADES/ENHANCEMENTS OF MICROSOFT INTERNET EXPLORER ON A WHEN-AND-IF-AVAILABLE BASIS, IS BASED ON THE SALES PRICE OF THOSE ELEMENTS WHEN SOLD

SEPARATELY AND IS RECOGNIZED RATABLY ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THE RELATED PRODUCTS LIFE CYCLE. THE PERCENTAGE OF REVENUE RECORDED AS UNEARNED DUE TO UNDELIVERED ELEMENTS RANGES FROM APPROXIMATELY 15% TO 25% OF THE SALES PRICE FOR WINDOWS

XP HOME, APPROXIMATELY 5% TO 15% OF THE SALES PRICE FOR WINDOWS XP PROFESSIONAL, AND APPROXIMATELY 1% TO 15% OF THE SALES PRICE FOR DESKTOP APPLICATIONS, DEPENDING ON THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THE LICENSE AND PRICES OF THE ELEMENTS. PRODUCT LIFE

CYCLES ARE CURRENTLY ESTIMATED AT THREE-AND-ONE-HALF YEARS FOR WINDOWS OPERATING SYSTEMS AND TWO YEARS FOR DESKTOP APPLICATIONS. UNEARNED REVENUE ALSO INCLUDES PAYMENTS FOR ONLINE ADVERTISING FOR WHICH THE ADVERTISEMENT HAS YET TO BE DISPLAYED AND

PAYMENTS FOR POST-DELIVERY SUPPORT SERVICES TO BE PERFORMED IN THE FUTURE.

UNEARNED REVENUE AS OF JUNE 30, 2004 DECREASED $838 MILLION FROM JUNE 30,

2003, REFLECTING RECOGNITION OF UNEARNED REVENUE FROM MULTI-YEAR LICENSING THAT HAS OUTPACED ADDITIONS BY $397 MILLION, PRIMARILY DUE TO RECOGNITION FROM UPGRADE ADVANTAGE LICENSING AGREEMENTS AND A $489 MILLION DECLINE IN REVENUE DEFERRED FOR

UNDELIVERED ELEMENTS. STARTING APRIL 1, 2003 REVENUE DEFERRED FOR UNDELIVERED ELEMENTS REFLECTED LOWER DEFERRAL RATES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LENGTHENED PRODUCT LIFE CYCLES FOR THE UNDERLYING PRODUCTS LICENSED, RESULTING IN A HIGHER PROPORTION OF

REVENUE EARNED. WE EARNED APPROXIMATELY $1.8 BILLION AND $1.1 BILLION FROM THE UPGRADE ADVANTAGE PROGRAMS FOR FISCAL 2003 AND 2004, RESPECTIVELY AND EXPECT TO EARN APPROXIMATELY $56 MILLION IN FISCAL 2005 FROM THOSE PROGRAMS.

CASH FLOWS

CASH FLOW FROM OPERATIONS FOR FISCAL 2004 DECREASED $1.17 BILLION TO $14.63 BILLION. THE DECREASE PRIMARILY REFLECTS THE COMBINED CASH

OUTFLOWS OF $2.56 BILLION RELATED TO THE SUN MICROSYSTEMS SETTLEMENT AND THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION FINE MENTIONED ABOVE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY INCREASED CASH RECEIPTS FROM CUSTOMERS DRIVEN BY THE RISE IN REVENUE BILLINGS. CASH USED FOR FINANCING WAS

$2.36 BILLION IN FISCAL 2004, A DECREASE OF $2.86 BILLION FROM THE PRIOR YEAR. THE DECREASE REFLECTS THAT WE DID NOT REPURCHASE ANY COMMON STOCK IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF FISCAL 2004 COMBINED WITH A $628 MILLION INCREASE PRIMARILY FROM STOCK

ISSUANCES RELATED TO EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTIONS EXERCISES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN $872 MILLION INCREASE IN CASH DIVIDENDS PAID. WE REPURCHASED 123.7 MILLION SHARES OF COMMON STOCK UNDER OUR SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM IN FISCAL 2004. CASH USED FOR

INVESTING WAS $2.75 BILLION IN FISCAL 2004, A DECREASE OF $4.47 BILLION FROM FISCAL 2003, DUE TO A $3.63 BILLION DECREASE IN NET INVESTMENT PURCHASES AND A $1.06 BILLION DECREASE IN ACQUISITION SPENDING.

CASH FLOW FROM OPERATIONS WAS $15.80 BILLION FOR FISCAL 2003, AN INCREASE OF $1.29 BILLION FROM FISCAL 2002. THE INCREASE PRIMARILY REFLECTS THE RISE IN CASH

RECEIPTS FROM CUSTOMERS DRIVEN BY THE INCREASE IN REVENUE BILLINGS AND MAINTENANCE OF RELATIVELY STABLE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE LEVELS. CASH USED FOR FINANCING WAS $5.22 BILLION IN FISCAL 2003, AN INCREASE OF $651 MILLION FROM THE PRIOR YEAR. THE

INCREASE REFLECTS A CASH DIVIDEND PAYMENT OF $857 MILLION IN 2003 AND AN INCREASE OF $417 MILLION IN COMMON STOCK REPURCHASE, OFFSETTING $623 MILLION RECEIVED FOR COMMON STOCK ISSUED. WE REPURCHASED 238.2 MILLION SHARES OF COMMON STOCK UNDER OUR

SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM IN FISCAL 2003. CASH USED FOR INVESTING WAS $7.21 BILLION IN FISCAL 2003, A DECREASE OF $3.63 BILLION FROM FISCAL 2002, DUE TO STRONGER PORTFOLIO PERFORMANCE ON SOLD AND MATURED INVESTMENTS.

CASH FLOW FROM OPERATIONS WAS $14.51 BILLION FOR FISCAL 2002, AN INCREASE OF $1.09 BILLION FROM FISCAL 2001. THE INCREASE REFLECTED STRONG GROWTH IN UNEARNED

REVENUE AS A RESULT OF THE SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF CUSTOMERS THAT PURCHASED UPGRADE ADVANTAGE DURING THE LICENSING 6.0 TRANSITION PERIOD. THIS RESULTED IN AN INCREASE IN BILLINGS AND A CORRESPONDING INCREASE IN THE UNEARNED REVENUE AMOUNT. CASH USED

FOR FINANCING WAS $4.57 BILLION IN FISCAL 2002, A DECREASE OF $1.01 BILLION FROM THE PRIOR YEAR. THE DECREASE REFLECTED THE REPURCHASE OF PUT WARRANTS IN THE PRIOR YEAR.

WE REPURCHASED 245.6 MILLION SHARES OF COMMON STOCK UNDER OUR SHARE

REPURCHASE PROGRAM IN FISCAL 2002. IN ADDITION, 10.2 MILLION SHARES OF COMMON STOCK WERE ACQUIRED IN FISCAL 2002 UNDER A STRUCTURED STOCK REPURCHASE TRANSACTION. WE ENTERED INTO THE STRUCTURED STOCK REPURCHASE TRANSACTION IN FISCAL 2001, WHICH GAVE

US THE RIGHT TO ACQUIRE 10.2 MILLION OF OUR SHARES IN EXCHANGE FOR AN UP-FRONT NET PAYMENT OF $264 MILLION. CASH USED FOR INVESTING WAS $10.85 BILLION IN FISCAL 2002, AN INCREASE OF $2.11 BILLION FROM FISCAL 2001.

WE HAVE NO MATERIAL LONG-TERM DEBT. STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY AT JUNE 30, 2004 WAS $74.8 BILLION. WE WILL CONTINUE TO INVEST IN SALES, MARKETING, PRODUCT SUPPORT

INFRASTRUCTURE, AND EXISTING AND ADVANCED AREAS OF TECHNOLOGY. ADDITIONS TO PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT WILL CONTINUE, INCLUDING NEW FACILITIES AND COMPUTER SYSTEMS FOR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, SALES AND MARKETING, SUPPORT, AND ADMINISTRATIVE STAFF.

COMMITMENTS FOR CONSTRUCTING NEW BUILDINGS WERE $129 MILLION ON JUNE 30, 2004. WE HAVE OPERATING LEASES FOR MOST U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL SALES AND SUPPORT OFFICES AND CERTAIN EQUIPMENT UNDER WHICH WE INCURRED RENTAL EXPENSE TOTALING $318 MILLION,

$290 MILLION, AND $331 MILLION IN FISCAL 2002, 2003, AND 2004, RESPECTIVELY. WE HAVE ISSUED RESIDUAL VALUE GUARANTEES IN CONNECTION WITH VARIOUS OPERATING LEASES. THESE GUARANTEES PROVIDE THAT IF WE DO NOT PURCHASE THE LEASED PROPERTY FROM THE

LESSOR AT THE END OF THE LEASE TERM, THEN WE ARE LIABLE TO THE LESSOR FOR AN AMOUNT EQUAL TO THE SHORTAGE (IF ANY) BETWEEN THE PROCEEDS FROM THE SALE OF THE PROPERTY AND AN AGREED VALUE. AS OF JUNE 30, 2004, THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT OF THE RESIDUAL VALUE

GUARANTEES WAS APPROXIMATELY $271 MILLION. WE BELIEVE THAT PROCEEDS FROM THE SALE OF PROPERTIES UNDER OPERATING LEASES WOULD EXCEED THE PAYMENT OBLIGATION AND THEREFORE NO LIABILITY CURRENTLY EXISTS. WE HAVE NOT ENGAGED IN ANY RELATED PARTY

TRANSACTIONS OR ARRANGEMENTS WITH UNCONSOLIDATED ENTITIES OR OTHER PERSONS THAT ARE REASONABLY LIKELY TO MATERIALLY AFFECT LIQUIDITY OR THE AVAILABILITY OF REQUIREMENTS FOR CAPITAL RESOURCES.

ON JULY 20, 2004, OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS APPROVED A QUARTERLY DIVIDEND OF $0.08 PER SHARE PAYABLE ON SEPTEMBER 14, 2004, TO SHAREHOLDERS OF RECORD ON AUGUST

25, 2004. IN ADDITION, THE BOARD APPROVED A PLAN TO BUY BACK UP TO $30 BILLION IN MICROSOFT COMMON STOCK OVER THE NEXT FOUR YEARS. THE SPECIFIC TIMING AND AMOUNT OF REPURCHASES WILL VARY BASED ON MARKET CONDITIONS, SECURITIES LAW LIMITATIONS, AND

OTHER FACTORS. THE REPURCHASES WILL BE MADE USING OUR CASH RESOURCES. THE REPURCHASE PROGRAM MAY BE SUSPENDED OR DISCONTINUED AT ANY TIME WITHOUT PRIOR NOTICE. THE BOARD ALSO APPROVED A ONE-TIME SPECIAL DIVIDEND OF $3.00 PER SHARE, OR APPROXIMATELY

$32 BILLION, SUBJECT TO SHAREHOLDER APPROVAL OF STOCK PLAN AMENDMENTS THAT WILL ALLOW CERTAIN ADJUSTMENTS TO EMPLOYEE EQUITY COMPENSATION AWARDS TO OFFSET THE IMPACT OF THE SPECIAL DIVIDEND. THE SPECIAL DIVIDEND WILL BE PAYABLE ON DECEMBER 2, 2004,

TO SHAREHOLDERS OF RECORD ON NOVEMBER 17, 2004, CONDITIONED UPON SHAREHOLDER APPROVAL OF AMENDMENTS TO THE EMPLOYEE STOCK PLANS AT THE ANNUAL MEETING OF SHAREHOLDERS SCHEDULED TO BE HELD NOVEMBER 9, 2004.

WE BELIEVE EXISTING CASH AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS, TOGETHER WITH FUNDS GENERATED FROM OPERATIONS SHOULD BE SUFFICIENT TO MEET OPERATING REQUIREMENTS AND OUR

SPECIAL DIVIDEND AS WELL AS REGULAR QUARTERLY DIVIDENDS. OUR PHILOSOPHY REGARDING THE MAINTENANCE OF A BALANCE SHEET WITH A LARGE COMPONENT OF CASH AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS, AS WELL AS EQUITY AND OTHER INVESTMENTS, REFLECTS OUR VIEWS ON POTENTIAL

FUTURE CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS RELATING TO RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, CREATION AND EXPANSION OF SALES DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS, INVESTMENTS AND ACQUISITIONS, SHARE DILUTION MANAGEMENT, LEGAL RISKS, AND CHALLENGES TO OUR BUSINESS MODEL. WE CONTINUOUSLY

ASSESS OUR INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT APPROACH IN VIEW OF OUR CURRENT AND POTENTIAL FUTURE NEEDS.

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS AND CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS

WE HAVE UNCONDITIONALLY GUARANTEED THE

REPAYMENT OF CERTAIN JAPANESE YEN DENOMINATED BANK LOANS AND RELATED INTEREST AND FEES OF JUPITER TELECOMMUNICATION, LTD., A JAPANESE CABLE COMPANY (JUPITER). THESE GUARANTEES AROSE ON FEBRUARY 1, 2003 IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE EXPIRATION OF PRIOR

FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS, INCLUDING PREVIOUS GUARANTEES BY US. THE FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS WERE ENTERED INTO BY JUPITER AS PART OF FINANCING ITS OPERATIONS. AS PART OF JUPITERS NEW FINANCING AGREEMENT, WE AGREED TO GUARANTEE REPAYMENT BY JUPITER

OF THE LOANS OF APPROXIMATELY $51 MILLION. THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE AND THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE GUARANTEES WAS $11 MILLION AND DID NOT RESULT IN A CHARGE TO OPERATIONS. THE GUARANTEES ARE IN EFFECT UNTIL THE EARLIER OF EITHER REPAYMENT OF THE

LOANS, INCLUDING ACCRUED INTEREST AND FEES, OR FEBRUARY 1, 2009. THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT OF THE GUARANTEES IS LIMITED TO THE SUM OF THE TOTAL DUE AND UNPAID PRINCIPAL AMOUNTS, ACCRUED AND UNPAID INTEREST, AND ANY OTHER RELATED EXPENSES. ADDITIONALLY, THE

MAXIMUM AMOUNT OF THE GUARANTEES, DENOMINATED IN JAPANESE YEN, WILL VARY BASED ON FLUCTUATIONS IN FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES. IF WE WERE REQUIRED TO MAKE PAYMENTS UNDER THE GUARANTEES, WE MIGHT RECOVER ALL OR A PORTION OF THOSE PAYMENTS UPON LIQUIDATION

OF JUPITERS ASSETS. THE PROCEEDS FROM AN ASSET LIQUIDATION CANNOT BE ACCURATELY ESTIMATED DUE TO THE MANY FACTORS THAT WOULD AFFECT THE VALUATION AND REALIZATION OF THE PROCEEDS.

RECENTLY ISSUED

ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

IN DECEMBER 2003, THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD

(FASB) ISSUED INTERPRETATION 46R (FIN 46R), A REVISION TO INTERPRETATION 46 (FIN 46),

CONSOLIDATION OF VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES.

FIN 46R CLARIFIES SOME OF THE PROVISIONS OF FIN 46 AND EXEMPTS CERTAIN ENTITIES FROM ITS REQUIREMENTS. FIN 46R

IS EFFECTIVE AT THE END OF THE FIRST INTERIM PERIOD ENDING AFTER MARCH 15, 2004. ENTITIES THAT HAVE ADOPTED FIN 46 PRIOR TO THIS EFFECTIVE DATE CAN CONTINUE TO APPLY THE PROVISIONS OF FIN 46 UNTIL THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF FIN 46R OR ELECT EARLY

ADOPTION OF FIN 46R. THE ADOPTION OF FIN 46 AND FIN 46R DID NOT HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

IN MARCH 2004, THE FASB RATIFIED

THE MEANING OF OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENT AND ITS APPLICATION TO CERTAIN

INVESTMENTS.

APPLIED TO OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENT EVALUATIONS IN REPORTING

PERIODS BEGINNING WITH OUR FIRST FISCAL QUARTER 2005. WE DO NOT BELIEVE THE ADOPTION OF THE RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT GUIDANCE IN EITF ISSUE NO. 03-1 WILL HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

IN JULY 2004, THE FASB RATIFIED EMERGING ISSUES TASK FORCE (EITF) CONSENSUS ON ISSUE NO. 02-14,

WHETHER AN INVESTOR SHOULD APPLY THE EQUITY METHOD OF ACCOUNTING

TO INVESTMENTS OTHER THAN COMMON STOCK

, WHICH PROVIDES GUIDANCE REGARDING APPLICATION OF THE EQUITY METHOD OF ACCOUNTING TO INVESTMENTS OTHER THAN COMMON STOCK. EITF ISSUE NO. 02-14 WILL BE EFFECTIVE BEGINNING WITH OUR SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL

2005. WE DO NOT BELIEVE THE ADOPTION OF EITF ISSUE NO. 02-14 WILL HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND ACCOMPANYING NOTES ARE PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH U.S. GAAP. PREPARING FINANCIAL STATEMENTS REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT

AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS, LIABILITIES, REVENUE, AND EXPENSES. THESE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS ARE AFFECTED BY MANAGEMENTS APPLICATION OF ACCOUNTING POLICIES. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES FOR US INCLUDE REVENUE RECOGNITION,

IMPAIRMENT OF INVESTMENT SECURITIES, IMPAIRMENT OF GOODWILL, ACCOUNTING FOR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS, ACCOUNTING FOR LEGAL CONTINGENCIES, AND ACCOUNTING FOR INCOME TAXES.

WE ACCOUNT FOR THE LICENSING OF SOFTWARE IN ACCORDANCE WITH AMERICAN INSTITUTE OF CERTIFIED PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS (AICPA) STATEMENT OF POSITION (SOP) 97-2,

SOFTWARE

REVENUE RECOGNITION.

THE APPLICATION OF SOP 97-2 REQUIRES JUDGMENT, INCLUDING WHETHER A SOFTWARE ARRANGEMENT INCLUDES MULTIPLE ELEMENTS, AND IF SO, WHETHER VENDOR-SPECIFIC OBJECTIVE EVIDENCE (VSOE) OF FAIR VALUE EXISTS FOR THOSE ELEMENTS.

CUSTOMERS RECEIVE CERTAIN ELEMENTS OF OUR PRODUCTS OVER A PERIOD OF TIME. THESE ELEMENTS INCLUDE FREE POST-DELIVERY TELEPHONE SUPPORT AND THE RIGHT TO RECEIVE UNSPECIFIED UPGRADES/ENHANCEMENTS OF MICROSOFT INTERNET EXPLORER ON A

WHEN-AND-IF-AVAILABLE BASIS, THE FAIR VALUE OF WHICH IS RECOGNIZED OVER THE PRODUCTS ESTIMATED LIFE CYCLE. CHANGES TO THE ELEMENTS IN A SOFTWARE ARRANGEMENT, THE ABILITY TO IDENTIFY VSOE FOR THOSE ELEMENTS, THE FAIR VALUE OF THE RESPECTIVE

ELEMENTS, AND CHANGES TO A PRODUCTS ESTIMATED LIFE CYCLE COULD MATERIALLY IMPACT THE AMOUNT OF EARNED AND UNEARNED REVENUE. JUDGMENT IS ALSO REQUIRED TO ASSESS WHETHER FUTURE RELEASES OF CERTAIN SOFTWARE REPRESENT NEW PRODUCTS OR UPGRADES AND

ENHANCEMENTS TO EXISTING PRODUCTS.

SFAS 115,

ACCOUNTING FOR CERTAIN INVESTMENTS IN DEBT AND EQUITY SECURITIES,

AND SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE

COMMISSION (SEC) STAFF ACCOUNTING BULLETIN (SAB) 59,

ACCOUNTING FOR NONCURRENT MARKETABLE EQUITY SECURITIES,

PROVIDE GUIDANCE ON DETERMINING WHEN AN INVESTMENT IS OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARILY IMPAIRED. INVESTMENTS ARE REVIEWED QUARTERLY FOR

INDICATORS OF OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENT. THIS DETERMINATION REQUIRES SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT. IN MAKING THIS JUDGMENT, WE EVALUATE, AMONG OTHER FACTORS, THE DURATION AND EXTENT TO WHICH THE FAIR VALUE OF AN INVESTMENT IS LESS THAN ITS COST; THE

FINANCIAL HEALTH OF AND NEAR-TERM BUSINESS OUTLOOK FOR THE INVESTEE, INCLUDING FACTORS SUCH AS INDUSTRY AND SECTOR PERFORMANCE, CHANGES IN TECHNOLOGY, AND OPERATIONAL AND FINANCING CASH FLOW; AND OUR INTENT AND ABILITY TO HOLD THE INVESTMENT.

INVESTMENTS WITH AN INDICATOR ARE FURTHER EVALUATED TO DETERMINE THE LIKELIHOOD OF A SIGNIFICANT ADVERSE AFFECT ON THE FAIR VALUE AND AMOUNT OF THE IMPAIRMENT AS NECESSARY. IN THE PAST, WE HAVE HAD SUBSTANTIAL IMPAIRMENTS IN OUR PORTFOLIO AS

DISCUSSED IN NOTE 4  INVESTMENT INCOME/(LOSS). IF MARKET, INDUSTRY AND/OR INVESTEE CONDITIONS DETERIORATE, WE MAY INCUR FUTURE IMPAIRMENTS.

SFAS 142,

GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS,

REQUIRES THAT GOODWILL BE TESTED FOR IMPAIRMENT AT THE REPORTING UNIT LEVEL (OPERATING SEGMENT OR ONE LEVEL BELOW AN OPERATING SEGMENT) ON AN ANNUAL BASIS (JULY 1 FOR US) AND BETWEEN

ANNUAL TESTS IF AN EVENT OCCURS OR CIRCUMSTANCES CHANGE THAT WOULD MORE LIKELY THAN NOT REDUCE THE FAIR VALUE OF A REPORTING UNIT BELOW ITS CARRYING VALUE. THESE EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES COULD INCLUDE A SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN THE BUSINESS CLIMATE,

LEGAL FACTORS, OPERATING PERFORMANCE INDICATORS, COMPETITION, SALE OR DISPOSITION OF A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF A REPORTING UNIT. APPLICATION OF THE GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT TEST REQUIRES JUDGMENT, INCLUDING THE IDENTIFICATION OF REPORTING UNITS,

ASSIGNMENT OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES TO REPORTING UNITS, ASSIGNMENT OF GOODWILL TO REPORTING UNITS, AND DETERMINATION OF THE FAIR VALUE OF EACH REPORTING UNIT. THE FAIR VALUE OF EACH REPORTING UNIT IS ESTIMATED USING A DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW

METHODOLOGY. THIS REQUIRES SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENTS INCLUDING ESTIMATION OF FUTURE CASH FLOWS, WHICH IS DEPENDENT ON INTERNAL FORECASTS, ESTIMATION OF THE LONG-TERM RATE OF GROWTH FOR OUR BUSINESS, THE USEFUL LIFE OVER WHICH CASH FLOWS WILL OCCUR, AND

DETERMINATION OF OUR WEIGHTED AVERAGE COST OF CAPITAL. CHANGES IN THESE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS COULD MATERIALLY AFFECT THE DETERMINATION OF FAIR VALUE AND/OR GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT FOR EACH REPORTING UNIT.

WE ACCOUNT FOR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH SEVERAL ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS, INCLUDING SFAS 2,

ACCOUNTING FOR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

COSTS,

AND SFAS 86,

ACCOUNTING FOR THE COSTS OF COMPUTER

SOFTWARE TO BE SOLD, LEASED, OR OTHERWISE MARKETED.

SFAS 86

SPECIFIES THAT COSTS INCURRED INTERNALLY IN RESEARCHING AND DEVELOPING A COMPUTER SOFTWARE PRODUCT SHOULD BE CHARGED TO EXPENSE UNTIL TECHNOLOGICAL FEASIBILITY HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED FOR THE PRODUCT. ONCE TECHNOLOGICAL FEASIBILITY IS ESTABLISHED, ALL

SOFTWARE COSTS SHOULD BE CAPITALIZED UNTIL THE PRODUCT IS AVAILABLE FOR GENERAL RELEASE TO CUSTOMERS. JUDGMENT IS REQUIRED IN DETERMINING WHEN TECHNOLOGICAL FEASIBILITY OF A PRODUCT IS ESTABLISHED. WE HAVE DETERMINED THAT TECHNOLOGICAL FEASIBILITY

FOR OUR SOFTWARE PRODUCTS IS REACHED SHORTLY BEFORE THE PRODUCTS ARE RELEASED TO MANUFACTURING. COSTS INCURRED AFTER TECHNOLOGICAL FEASIBILITY IS ESTABLISHED ARE NOT MATERIAL, AND ACCORDINGLY, WE EXPENSE ALL RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS WHEN

INCURRED.

THE OUTCOMES OF LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND CLAIMS BROUGHT AGAINST US ARE SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT UNCERTAINTY. SFAS 5,

ACCOUNTING FOR

CONTINGENCIES,

REQUIRES THAT AN ESTIMATED LOSS FROM A LOSS CONTINGENCY SUCH AS A LEGAL PROCEEDING OR CLAIM SHOULD BE ACCRUED BY A CHARGE TO INCOME IF IT IS PROBABLE THAT AN ASSET HAS BEEN IMPAIRED OR A LIABILITY HAS BEEN INCURRED AND THE AMOUNT

OF THE LOSS CAN BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED. DISCLOSURE OF A CONTINGENCY IS REQUIRED IF THERE IS AT LEAST A REASONABLE POSSIBILITY THAT A LOSS HAS BEEN INCURRED. IN DETERMINING WHETHER A LOSS SHOULD BE ACCRUED WE EVALUATE, AMONG OTHER FACTORS, THE

DEGREE OF PROBABILITY OF AN UNFAVORABLE OUTCOME AND THE ABILITY TO MAKE A REASONABLE ESTIMATE OF THE AMOUNT OF LOSS. CHANGES IN THESE FACTORS COULD MATERIALLY IMPACT OUR FINANCIAL POSITION OR OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

SFAS 109,

ACCOUNTING FOR INCOME TAXES,

ESTABLISHES FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING AND REPORTING STANDARDS FOR THE EFFECT OF INCOME TAXES. THE OBJECTIVES OF ACCOUNTING

FOR INCOME TAXES ARE TO RECOGNIZE THE AMOUNT OF TAXES PAYABLE OR REFUNDABLE FOR THE CURRENT YEAR AND DEFERRED TAX LIABILITIES AND ASSETS FOR THE FUTURE TAX CONSEQUENCES OF EVENTS THAT HAVE BEEN RECOGNIZED IN AN ENTITYS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OR

TAX RETURNS. JUDGMENT IS REQUIRED IN ASSESSING THE FUTURE TAX CONSEQUENCES OF EVENTS THAT HAVE BEEN RECOGNIZED IN OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OR TAX RETURNS. VARIATIONS IN THE ACTUAL OUTCOME OF THESE FUTURE TAX CONSEQUENCES COULD MATERIALLY IMPACT OUR

FINANCIAL POSITION OR OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

ISSUES AND

UNCERTAINTIES

THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K CONTAINS STATEMENTS THAT ARE

FORWARD-LOOKING. THESE STATEMENTS ARE BASED ON CURRENT EXPECTATIONS AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT ARE SUBJECT TO RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES. ACTUAL RESULTS COULD DIFFER MATERIALLY BECAUSE OF ISSUES AND UNCERTAINTIES SUCH AS THOSE LISTED BELOW AND ELSEWHERE IN

THIS REPORT, WHICH, AMONG OTHERS, SHOULD BE CONSIDERED IN EVALUATING OUR FUTURE FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE.

CHALLENGES TO OUR BUSINESS MODEL.

SINCE OUR INCEPTION, OUR BUSINESS MODEL HAS BEEN BASED UPON CUSTOMERS AGREEING TO PAY A FEE TO LICENSE SOFTWARE DEVELOPED AND DISTRIBUTED BY US. UNDER THIS

COMMERCIAL SOFTWARE MODEL, SOFTWARE DEVELOPERS BEAR THE COSTS OF CONVERTING ORIGINAL IDEAS INTO SOFTWARE PRODUCTS THROUGH INVESTMENTS IN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, OFFSETTING THESE COSTS WITH THE REVENUE RECEIVED FROM THE DISTRIBUTION OF THEIR

PRODUCTS. WE BELIEVE THE COMMERCIAL SOFTWARE MODEL HAS HAD SUBSTANTIAL BENEFITS FOR USERS OF SOFTWARE, ALLOWING THEM TO RELY ON OUR EXPERTISE AND THE EXPERTISE OF OTHER SOFTWARE DEVELOPERS THAT HAVE POWERFUL INCENTIVES TO DEVELOP INNOVATIVE SOFTWARE

THAT IS USEFUL, RELIABLE, AND COMPATIBLE WITH OTHER SOFTWARE AND HARDWARE. IN RECENT YEARS, THERE HAS BEEN A GROWING CHALLENGE TO THE COMMERCIAL SOFTWARE MODEL. UNDER THE NON-COMMERCIAL SOFTWARE MODEL, OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE PRODUCED BY LOOSELY

ASSOCIATED GROUPS OF UNPAID PROGRAMMERS AND MADE AVAILABLE FOR LICENSE TO END USERS WITHOUT CHARGE IS DISTRIBUTED BY FIRMS AT NOMINAL COST THAT EARN REVENUE ON COMPLEMENTARY SERVICES AND PRODUCTS, WITHOUT HAVING TO BEAR THE FULL COSTS OF RESEARCH

AND DEVELOPMENT FOR THE OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE. THE MOST NOTABLE EXAMPLE OF OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE IS THE LINUX OPERATING SYSTEM. WHILE WE BELIEVE OUR PRODUCTS PROVIDE CUSTOMERS WITH SIGNIFICANT ADVANTAGES IN SECURITY AND PRODUCTIVITY, AND GENERALLY

HAVE A LOWER TOTAL COST OF OWNERSHIP THAN OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE, THE POPULARIZATION OF THE NON-COMMERCIAL SOFTWARE MODEL CONTINUES TO POSE A SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGE TO OUR BUSINESS MODEL, INCLUDING RECENT EFFORTS BY PROPONENTS OF OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE

TO CONVINCE GOVERNMENTS WORLDWIDE TO MANDATE THE USE OF OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE IN THEIR PURCHASE AND DEPLOYMENT OF SOFTWARE PRODUCTS. TO THE EXTENT OPENS SOURCE SOFTWARE GAINS INCREASING MARKET ACCEPTANCE, SALES OF OUR PRODUCTS MAY DECLINE, WE MAY

HAVE TO REDUCE THE PRICES WE CHARGE FOR OUR PRODUCTS, AND REVENUE AND OPERATING MARGINS MAY CONSEQUENTLY DECLINE.

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS.

WE DEFEND OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS, BUT UNLICENSED COPYING AND USE OF SOFTWARE AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

RIGHTS REPRESENTS A LOSS OF REVENUE TO US. WHILE THIS ADVERSELY AFFECTS U.S. REVENUE, THE IMPACT ON REVENUE FROM OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES IS MORE SIGNIFICANT, PARTICULARLY IN COUNTRIES WHERE LAWS ARE LESS PROTECTIVE OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS.

THROUGHOUT THE WORLD, WE ACTIVELY EDUCATE CONSUMERS ABOUT THE BENEFITS OF

PAGE

TABLE OF CONTENTS

PART II

ITEM 7

LICENSING GENUINE PRODUCTS AND EDUCATE LAWMAKERS ABOUT THE ADVANTAGES OF

A BUSINESS CLIMATE WHERE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS ARE PROTECTED. HOWEVER, CONTINUED EDUCATIONAL AND ENFORCEMENT EFFORTS MAY NOT AFFECT REVENUE POSITIVELY, AND REVENUE COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY FURTHER DETERIORATION IN COMPLIANCE WITH

EXISTING LEGAL PROTECTIONS OR REDUCTIONS IN THE LEGAL PROTECTION FOR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS OF SOFTWARE DEVELOPERS.

FROM TIME TO TIME WE

RECEIVE NOTICES FROM OTHERS CLAIMING WE INFRINGE THEIR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS. THE NUMBER OF THESE CLAIMS MAY GROW. RESPONDING TO THESE CLAIMS MAY REQUIRE US TO ENTER INTO ROYALTY AND LICENSING AGREEMENTS ON UNFAVORABLE TERMS, REQUIRE US TO

STOP SELLING OR TO REDESIGN AFFECTED PRODUCTS, OR TO PAY DAMAGES OR TO SATISFY INDEMNIFICATION COMMITMENTS WITH OUR CUSTOMERS. IF WE ARE REQUIRED TO ENTER INTO SUCH AGREEMENTS OR TAKE SUCH ACTIONS, OUR OPERATING MARGINS MAY DECLINE AS A RESULT.

WE HAVE MADE AND EXPECT TO CONTINUE MAKING SIGNIFICANT EXPENDITURES TO ACQUIRE THE USE OF TECHNOLOGY AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS, INCLUDING VIA

CROSS-LICENSES OF BROAD PATENT PORTFOLIOS.

UNAUTHORIZED DISCLOSURE OF SOURCE

CODE.

SOURCE CODE, THE DETAILED PROGRAM COMMANDS FOR OUR OPERATING SYSTEMS AND SOFTWARE PROGRAMS, IS THE MOST SIGNIFICANT ASSET WE OWN. WHILE WE LICENSE CERTAIN PORTIONS OF OUR SOURCE CODE FOR VARIOUS SOFTWARE

PROGRAMS AND OPERATING SYSTEMS TO A NUMBER OF LICENSEES, WE TAKE SIGNIFICANT MEASURES TO PROTECT THE SECRECY OF LARGE PORTIONS OF OUR SOURCE CODE. IF AN UNAUTHORIZED DISCLOSURE OF A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR SOURCE CODE OCCURS, WE COULD POTENTIALLY

LOSE FUTURE TRADE SECRET PROTECTION FOR THAT SOURCE CODE. THE LOSS OF FUTURE TRADE SECRET PROTECTION COULD MAKE IT EASIER FOR THIRD PARTIES TO COMPETE WITH OUR PRODUCTS BY COPYING FUNCTIONALITY, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR REVENUE AND OPERATING

MARGINS. UNAUTHORIZED DISCLOSURE OF SOURCE CODE COULD ALSO INCREASE CERTAIN RISKS DESCRIBED BELOW UNDER SECURITY.

NEW PRODUCTS AND SERVICES.

WE HAVE MADE SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS IN RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT AND MARKETING FOR NEW PRODUCTS, SERVICES, AND TECHNOLOGIES,

INCLUDING LONGHORN, MICROSOFT .NET, XBOX, BUSINESS APPLICATIONS, MSN, AND MOBILE AND WIRELESS TECHNOLOGIES. SIGNIFICANT REVENUE FROM NEW PRODUCT AND SERVICE INVESTMENTS MAY NOT BE ACHIEVED FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS, IF AT ALL. MOREOVER, THESE PRODUCTS

AND SERVICES MAY NOT BE PROFITABLE, AND EVEN IF THEY ARE PROFITABLE, OPERATING MARGINS FOR THESE BUSINESSES MAY NOT BE AS HIGH AS THE MARGINS WE HAVE EXPERIENCED HISTORICALLY.

LITIGATION.

AS DISCUSSED IN NOTE 17  CONTINGENCIES OF THE NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, WE ARE SUBJECT

TO A VARIETY OF CLAIMS AND LAWSUITS. ADVERSE OUTCOMES IN SOME OR ALL OF THE PENDING CASES MAY RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT MONETARY DAMAGES OR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AGAINST US. WE ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO A VARIETY OF OTHER CLAIMS AND SUITS THAT ARISE FROM TIME TO

TIME IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF OUR BUSINESS. WHILE MANAGEMENT CURRENTLY BELIEVES THAT RESOLVING ALL OF THESE MATTERS, INDIVIDUALLY OR IN THE AGGREGATE, WILL NOT HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR FINANCIAL POSITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, THE

LITIGATION AND OTHER CLAIMS NOTED ABOVE ARE SUBJECT TO INHERENT UNCERTAINTIES AND MANAGEMENTS VIEW OF THESE MATTERS MAY CHANGE IN THE FUTURE. THERE EXISTS THE POSSIBILITY OF A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR FINANCIAL POSITION AND THE RESULTS

OF OPERATIONS FOR THE PERIOD IN WHICH THE EFFECT OF AN UNFAVORABLE FINAL OUTCOME BECOMES PROBABLE AND REASONABLY ESTIMABLE.

SECURITY.

MAINTAINING THE SECURITY OF COMPUTERS AND COMPUTER NETWORKS IS AN ISSUE OF CRITICAL IMPORTANCE FOR US AND OUR CUSTOMERS. THERE ARE MALICIOUS

HACKERS WHO DEVELOP AND DEPLOY VIRUSES, WORMS, AND OTHER MALICIOUS SOFTWARE PROGRAMS THAT ATTACK OUR PRODUCTS. WHILE THIS IS AN INDUSTRY-WIDE PHENOMENON THAT AFFECTS COMPUTERS ACROSS ALL PLATFORMS, OUR CUSTOMERS IN PARTICULAR HAVE BEEN VICTIMS OF

SUCH ATTACKS AND WILL LIKELY CONTINUE TO BE SO. WE ARE DEVOTING SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES TO ADDRESSING THESE CRITICAL ISSUES. WE ARE FOCUSING OUR EFFORTS ON ENGINEERING MORE SECURE PRODUCTS, OPTIMIZING SECURITY AND RELIABILITY OPTIONS AND SETTINGS WHEN

WE DELIVER PRODUCTS, AND PROVIDING GUIDANCE TO HELP OUR CUSTOMERS MAKE THE BEST USE OF OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES TO PROTECT AGAINST COMPUTER VIRUSES AND OTHER ATTACKS ON THEIR COMPUTING ENVIRONMENT. IN ADDITION, WE ARE WORKING TO IMPROVE THE

DEPLOYMENT OF SOFTWARE UPDATES TO ADDRESS SECURITY VULNERABILITIES DISCOVERED AFTER OUR PRODUCTS ARE RELEASED. WE ARE ALSO INVESTING IN MITIGATION TECHNOLOGIES THAT HELP TO SECURE CUSTOMERS FROM ATTACKS EVEN WHEN SUCH SOFTWARE UPDATES ARE NOT

DEPLOYED. WE ARE ALSO ADVISING CUSTOMERS ON HOW TO HELP PROTECT THEMSELVES FROM SECURITY THREATS THROUGH THE USE OF OUR ONLINE AUTOMATED SECURITY TOOLS, OUR PUBLISHED SECURITY GUIDANCE, AND THE DEPLOYMENT OF SECURITY SOFTWARE SUCH AS FIREWALLS,

ANTIVIRUS, AND OTHER SECURITY SOFTWARE. THESE STEPS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR OPERATING MARGINS. DESPITE THESE EFFORTS, ACTUAL OR PERCEIVED SECURITY VULNERABILITIES IN OUR PRODUCTS COULD LEAD SOME CUSTOMERS TO SEEK TO RETURN PRODUCTS, TO REDUCE OR

DELAY FUTURE PURCHASES, OR TO PURCHASE COMPETITIVE PRODUCTS. CUSTOMERS MAY ALSO INCREASE THEIR EXPENDITURES ON PROTECTING THEIR COMPUTER SYSTEMS FROM ATTACK, WHICH COULD DELAY ADOPTION OF NEW TECHNOLOGIES. ANY OF THESE ACTIONS BY CUSTOMERS COULD

ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR REVENUE.

DECLINES IN DEMAND FOR SOFTWARE.

IF

OVERALL MARKET DEMAND FOR PCS, SERVERS, AND OTHER COMPUTING DEVICES DECLINES SIGNIFICANTLY, OR CONSUMER OR CORPORATE SPENDING FOR SUCH PRODUCTS DECLINES, OUR REVENUE WILL BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED. ADDITIONALLY, OUR REVENUE WOULD BE UNFAVORABLY IMPACTED

IF CUSTOMERS REDUCE THEIR PURCHASES OF NEW SOFTWARE PRODUCTS OR UPGRADES TO EXISTING PRODUCTS BECAUSE NEW PRODUCT OFFERINGS ARE NOT PERCEIVED AS ADDING SIGNIFICANT NEW FUNCTIONALITY OR OTHER VALUE TO PROSPECTIVE PURCHASERS. A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF

CUSTOMERS PURCHASED LICENSE AGREEMENTS PROVIDING UPGRADE RIGHTS TO SPECIFIC LICENSED PRODUCTS PRIOR TO THE TRANSITION TO LICENSING 6.0 IN JULY 2002. THESE AGREEMENTS GENERALLY EXPIRED THROUGHOUT FISCAL 2004 AND WILL LARGELY BE EXPIRED BY THE END OF

THE FIRST FISCAL QUARTER IN 2005. THE RATE AT WHICH SUCH CUSTOMERS RENEW THESE CONTRACTS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT FUTURE REVENUE. WE ARE MAKING SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS IN THE NEXT RELEASE OF THE WINDOWS OPERATING SYSTEM, CODE-NAMED LONGHORN. IF THIS

SYSTEM IS NOT PERCEIVED AS OFFERING SIGNIFICANT NEW FUNCTIONALITY OR VALUE TO PROSPECTIVE PURCHASERS, OUR REVENUE AND OPERATING MARGINS COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT SCHEDULE.

THE DEVELOPMENT OF SOFTWARE PRODUCTS IS A COMPLEX AND TIME-CONSUMING PROCESS. NEW PRODUCTS

AND ENHANCEMENTS TO EXISTING PRODUCTS CAN REQUIRE LONG DEVELOPMENT AND TESTING PERIODS. SIGNIFICANT DELAYS IN NEW PRODUCT RELEASES OR SIGNIFICANT PROBLEMS IN CREATING NEW PRODUCTS, PARTICULARLY ANY DELAYS IN THE LONGHORN OPERATING SYSTEM, COULD

ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR REVENUE.

GENERAL ECONOMIC AND GEO-POLITICAL

RISKS.

SOFTNESS IN CORPORATE INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SPENDING OR OTHER CHANGES IN GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS THAT AFFECT DEMAND FOR COMPUTER HARDWARE OR SOFTWARE COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR REVENUE. TERRORIST ACTIVITY AND

ARMED CONFLICT POSE THE ADDITIONAL RISK OF GENERAL ECONOMIC DISRUPTION AND COULD REQUIRE CHANGES IN OUR OPERATIONS AND SECURITY ARRANGEMENTS, THUS INCREASING OUR OPERATING COSTS. THESE CONDITIONS LEND ADDITIONAL UNCERTAINTY TO THE TIMING AND BUDGET

FOR TECHNOLOGY INVESTMENT DECISIONS BY OUR CUSTOMERS.

COMPETITION.

WE CONTINUE TO EXPERIENCE INTENSIVE COMPETITION ACROSS ALL MARKETS FOR OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. THESE COMPETITIVE PRESSURES MAY RESULT IN DECREASED SALES VOLUMES, PRICE REDUCTIONS, AND/OR

INCREASED OPERATING COSTS, SUCH AS FOR MARKETING AND SALES INCENTIVES, RESULTING IN LOWER REVENUE, GROSS MARGINS, AND OPERATING INCOME.

TAXATION OF EXTRATERRITORIAL INCOME.

IN AUGUST 2001, A WORLD TRADE ORGANIZATION (WTO) DISPUTE PANEL DETERMINED THAT THE TAX PROVISIONS OF

THE FSC REPEAL AND EXTRATERRITORIAL INCOME EXCLUSION ACT OF 2000 (ETI) CONSTITUTE AN EXPORT SUBSIDY PROHIBITED BY THE WTO AGREEMENT ON SUBSIDIES AND COUNTERVAILING MEASURES. THE U.S. GOVERNMENT APPEALED THE PANELS DECISION AND LOST

ITS APPEAL. ON MARCH 1, 2004, THE EUROPEAN UNION BEGAN IMPOSING RETALIATORY TARIFFS ON A SPECIFIED LIST OF U.S.-SOURCE GOODS. IN MAY, THE U.S. SENATE PASSED THE JUMPSTART OUR BUSINESS STRENGTH (JOBS) ACT THAT WOULD REPEAL ETI, PROVIDE A THREE-YEAR

PHASE-OUT OF CURRENT ETI BENEFITS, AND WOULD REPLACE ETI WITH A PHASED-IN 9% DOMESTIC PRODUCTION ACTIVITY DEDUCTION THAT WOULD NOT BE FULLY EFFECTIVE UNTIL 2012. THE U.S. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES PASSED SIMILAR LEGISLATION IN JUNE THAT WOULD REPEAL

ETI EFFECTIVE DECEMBER 31, 2004, PROVIDE A TWO-YEAR PHASE-OUT OF ETI BENEFITS, AND REPLACE ETI WITH A 3% TAX RATE REDUCTION FOR INCOME FROM DOMESTIC PRODUCTION ACTIVITIES THAT WOULD BE FULL PHASED IN BY 2006. NEITHER BILL WILL FULLY REPLACE OUR

CURRENT ETI TAX BENEFITS. BOTH BILLS MUST STILL BE RECONCILED IN CONFERENCE, AND SIGNIFICANT CHANGES COULD BE MADE TO THE FINAL LEGISLATION, SO WE REMAIN UNABLE TO ASSESS THE ULTIMATE FORM AND FINANCIAL IMPACT OF THIS LEGISLATION, IF ENACTED. IF THE

ETI PROVISIONS ARE REPEALED AND FINANCIALLY COMPARABLE REPLACEMENT TAX LEGISLATION IS NOT ENACTED, THE LOSS OF THE ETI TAX BENEFIT TO US COULD BE SIGNIFICANT.

OTHER POTENTIAL TAX LIABILITIES.

WE ARE SUBJECT TO INCOME TAXES IN BOTH THE UNITED STATES AND NUMEROUS FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS. SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT

IS REQUIRED IN DETERMINING OUR WORLDWIDE PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES. IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF OUR BUSINESS, THERE ARE MANY TRANSACTIONS AND CALCULATIONS WHERE THE ULTIMATE TAX DETERMINATION IS UNCERTAIN. WE ARE REGULARLY UNDER AUDIT BY TAX

AUTHORITIES. ALTHOUGH WE BELIEVE OUR TAX ESTIMATES ARE REASONABLE, THE FINAL DETERMINATION OF TAX AUDITS AND ANY RELATED LITIGATION COULD BE MATERIALLY DIFFERENT THAN THAT WHICH IS REFLECTED IN HISTORICAL INCOME TAX PROVISIONS AND ACCRUALS. SHOULD

ADDITIONAL TAXES BE ASSESSED AS A RESULT OF AN AUDIT OR LITIGATION, A MATERIAL EFFECT ON OUR INCOME TAX PROVISION AND NET INCOME IN THE PERIOD OR PERIODS FOR WHICH THAT DETERMINATION IS MADE COULD RESULT.

INSURANCE PROGRAMS.

IN ADDITION TO CONVENTIONAL THIRD-PARTY INSURANCE

ARRANGEMENTS, WE HAVE ENTERED INTO CAPTIVE INSURANCE ARRANGEMENTS FOR THE PURPOSE OF PROTECTING AGAINST POSSIBLE CATASTROPHIC AND OTHER RISKS NOT COVERED BY TRADITIONAL INSURANCE MARKETS. AS OF JUNE 30, 2004, THE FACE VALUE OF CAPTIVE INSURANCE

ARRANGEMENTS WAS $2.0

BILLION. ACTUAL VALUE AT ANY PARTICULAR TIME WILL VARY DUE TO

DEDUCTIBLES, EXCLUSIONS, OTHER RESTRICTIONS, AND CLAIMS. WHILE WE BELIEVE THESE ARRANGEMENTS ARE AN EFFECTIVE WAY TO INSURE AGAINST SUCH RISKS, THE POTENTIAL LIABILITIES ASSOCIATED WITH CERTAIN OF THE ISSUES AND UNCERTAINTIES DISCUSSED IN THIS

DOCUMENT OR OTHER EVENTS COULD EXCEED THE COVERAGE PROVIDED BY SUCH ARRANGEMENTS.

BUSINESS DISRUPTIONS IN THE EVENT OF A CATASTROPHIC EVENT.

WE ARE A HIGHLY AUTOMATED BUSINESS AND A DISRUPTION OR FAILURE OF OUR SYSTEMS IN THE EVENT OF A MAJOR EARTHQUAKE, CYBER-ATTACK, TERRORIST ATTACK, OR

OTHER CATASTROPHIC EVENT COULD CAUSE DELAYS IN COMPLETING SALES AND PROVIDING SERVICES. OUR CORPORATE HEADQUARTERS, A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES, AND CERTAIN OTHER CRITICAL BUSINESS OPERATIONS ARE LOCATED IN THE

SEATTLE, WASHINGTON AREA, AND WE HAVE OTHER BUSINESS OPERATIONS IN THE SILICON VALLEY AREA OF CALIFORNIA, BOTH OF WHICH ARE NEAR MAJOR EARTHQUAKE FAULTS. A CATASTROPHIC EVENT THAT RESULTS IN THE DESTRUCTION OR DISRUPTION OF ANY OF OUR CRITICAL

BUSINESS OR INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS COULD SEVERELY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO CONDUCT NORMAL BUSINESS OPERATIONS AND, AS A RESULT, OUR FUTURE OPERATING RESULTS COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

ITEM 7A.    QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

WE ARE EXPOSED TO FOREIGN CURRENCY, INTEREST RATE, AND FIXED INCOME AND EQUITY PRICE RISKS. A PORTION OF THESE RISKS IS HEDGED, BUT FLUCTUATIONS COULD IMPACT OUR RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL POSITION. WE HEDGE A PORTION OF ANTICIPATED REVENUE AND ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE EXPOSURE TO FOREIGN CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS, PRIMARILY WITH OPTION CONTRACTS. WE MONITOR OUR FOREIGN CURRENCY EXPOSURES DAILY TO MAXIMIZE THE OVERALL

EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR FOREIGN CURRENCY HEDGE POSITIONS. PRINCIPAL CURRENCIES HEDGED INCLUDE THE EURO, JAPANESE YEN, BRITISH POUND, AND CANADIAN DOLLAR. FIXED INCOME SECURITIES ARE SUBJECT TO INTEREST RATE RISK. THE PORTFOLIO IS DIVERSIFIED AND

STRUCTURED TO MINIMIZE CREDIT RISK. SECURITIES HELD IN OUR EQUITY AND OTHER INVESTMENTS PORTFOLIO ARE SUBJECT TO PRICE RISK, AND ARE GENERALLY NOT HEDGED. HOWEVER, WE USE OPTIONS TO HEDGE OUR PRICE RISK ON CERTAIN EQUITY SECURITIES THAT ARE HELD

PRIMARILY FOR STRATEGIC PURPOSES.

WE USE A VALUE-AT-RISK (VAR) MODEL TO ESTIMATE AND QUANTIFY OUR MARKET RISKS. VAR IS THE EXPECTED LOSS, FOR A GIVEN

CONFIDENCE LEVEL, IN FAIR VALUE OF OUR PORTFOLIO DUE TO ADVERSE MARKET MOVEMENTS OVER A DEFINED TIME HORIZON. THE VAR MODEL IS NOT INTENDED TO REPRESENT ACTUAL LOSSES IN FAIR VALUE, BUT IS USED AS A RISK ESTIMATION AND MANAGEMENT TOOL. THE MODEL

USED FOR CURRENCIES AND EQUITIES IS GEOMETRIC BROWNIAN MOTION, WHICH ALLOWS INCORPORATION OF OPTIONALITY WITH REGARD TO THESE RISK EXPOSURES. FOR INTEREST RATE RISK, THE MEAN REVERTING GEOMETRIC BROWNIAN MOTION IS USED TO REFLECT THE PRINCIPLE THAT

FIXED-INCOME SECURITIES PRICES REVERT TO MATURITY VALUE OVER TIME.

VALUE-AT-RISK IS CALCULATED BY, FIRST, SIMULATING 10,000 MARKET PRICE PATHS OVER

20 DAYS FOR EQUITIES, INTEREST RATES AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES, TAKING INTO ACCOUNT HISTORICAL CORRELATIONS AMONG THE DIFFERENT RATES AND PRICES. EACH

ITEM 7A

RESULTING UNIQUE SET OF EQUITIES PRICES, INTEREST RATES, AND FOREIGN

EXCHANGE RATES IS THEN APPLIED TO SUBSTANTIALLY ALL INDIVIDUAL HOLDINGS TO RE-PRICE EACH HOLDING. THE 250

TH

WORST PERFORMANCE (OUT OF

10,000) REPRESENTS THE VALUE-AT-RISK OVER 20 DAYS AT THE 97.5 PERCENTILE CONFIDENCE LEVEL. SEVERAL RISK FACTORS ARE NOT CAPTURED IN THE MODEL, INCLUDING LIQUIDITY RISK, OPERATIONAL RISK, CREDIT RISK, AND LEGAL RISK.

CERTAIN SECURITIES IN OUR EQUITY PORTFOLIO ARE HELD FOR STRATEGIC PURPOSES. WE HEDGE THE VALUE OF A PORTION OF THESE SECURITIES THROUGH THE USE OF DERIVATIVE

CONTRACTS SUCH AS PUT-CALL COLLARS. IN THESE ARRANGEMENTS, WE HEDGE A SECURITYS EQUITY PRICE RISK BELOW THE PURCHASED PUT STRIKE AND FORGO MOST OR ALL OF THE BENEFITS OF THE SECURITYS APPRECIATION ABOVE THE SOLD CALL STRIKE, IN EXCHANGE

FOR PREMIUM RECEIVED FOR THE SOLD CALL. WE ALSO HOLD EQUITY SECURITIES FOR GENERAL INVESTMENT RETURN PURPOSES. WE HAVE INCURRED MATERIAL IMPAIRMENT CHARGES RELATED TO THESE SECURITIES IN PRIOR PERIODS. THE VAR AMOUNTS DISCLOSED BELOW ARE USED AS A

RISK MANAGEMENT TOOL AND REFLECT AN ESTIMATE OF POTENTIAL REDUCTIONS IN FAIR VALUE OF OUR PORTFOLIO. LOSSES IN FAIR VALUE OVER A 20-DAY HOLDING PERIOD CAN EXCEED THE REPORTED VAR BY SIGNIFICANT AMOUNTS AND CAN ALSO ACCUMULATE OVER A LONGER TIME

HORIZON THAN THE 20-DAY HOLDING PERIOD USED IN THE VAR ANALYSIS. VAR AMOUNTS ARE NOT NECESSARILY REFLECTIVE OF POTENTIAL ACCOUNTING LOSSES, INCLUDING DETERMINATIONS OF OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY LOSSES IN FAIR VALUE IN ACCORDANCE WITH U.S. GAAP.

THE VAR NUMBERS ARE SHOWN SEPARATELY FOR INTEREST RATE, CURRENCY, AND EQUITY RISKS. THESE VAR NUMBERS INCLUDE THE UNDERLYING PORTFOLIO POSITIONS AND

RELATED HEDGES. WE USE HISTORICAL DATA TO ESTIMATE VAR. GIVEN THE RELIANCE ON HISTORICAL DATA, VAR IS MOST EFFECTIVE IN ESTIMATING RISK EXPOSURES IN MARKETS IN WHICH THERE ARE NO FUNDAMENTAL CHANGES OR SHIFTS IN MARKET CONDITIONS. AN INHERENT

LIMITATION IN VAR IS THAT THE DISTRIBUTION OF PAST CHANGES IN MARKET RISK FACTORS MAY NOT PRODUCE ACCURATE PREDICTIONS OF FUTURE MARKET RISK.

THE FOLLOWING TABLE SETS FORTH THE VAR CALCULATIONS FOR SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR POSITIONS.

THE TOTAL VAR FOR THE COMBINED RISK CATEGORIES

IS $835 MILLION AT JUNE 30, 2004 AND $987 MILLION AT JUNE 30, 2003. THE TOTAL VAR IS 35% LESS AT JUNE 30, 2004 AND 32% LESS AT JUNE, 30 2003 THAN THE SUM OF THE SEPARATE RISK CATEGORIES FOR EACH OF THOSE YEARS IN THE ABOVE TABLE, DUE TO THE

DIVERSIFICATION BENEFIT OF THE COMBINATION OF RISKS. THE CHANGE IN THE ABSOLUTE VALUE OF VAR IS PRIMARILY DUE TO ASSET ALLOCATION SHIFTS AND PORTFOLIO GROWTH.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 1    ACCOUNTING POLICIES

ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES

THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND ACCOMPANYING NOTES ARE PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES

GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.

PRINCIPLES OF

CONSOLIDATION

THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDE THE ACCOUNTS OF MICROSOFT

CORPORATION AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES (MICROSOFT). INTERCOMPANY TRANSACTIONS AND BALANCES HAVE BEEN ELIMINATED. EQUITY INVESTMENTS IN WHICH WE EXERCISED SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE BUT DO NOT CONTROL AND ARE NOT THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY ARE ACCOUNTED FOR USING

THE EQUITY METHOD. INVESTMENTS IN WHICH WE ARE NOT ABLE TO EXERCISE SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE OVER THE INVESTEE ARE ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER THE COST METHOD.

ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS

PREPARING FINANCIAL STATEMENTS REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS, LIABILITIES, REVENUE, AND EXPENSES. EXAMPLES

INCLUDE ESTIMATES OF LOSS CONTINGENCIES AND PRODUCT LIFE CYCLES, AND ASSUMPTIONS SUCH AS THE ELEMENTS COMPRISING A SOFTWARE ARRANGEMENT, INCLUDING THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN UPGRADES/ENHANCEMENTS AND NEW PRODUCTS; WHEN TECHNOLOGICAL FEASIBILITY IS

ACHIEVED FOR OUR PRODUCTS; THE POTENTIAL OUTCOME OF FUTURE TAX CONSEQUENCES OF EVENTS THAT HAVE BEEN RECOGNIZED IN OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OR TAX RETURNS; AND DETERMINING WHEN INVESTMENT IMPAIRMENTS ARE OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY. ACTUAL RESULTS AND

OUTCOMES MAY DIFFER FROM MANAGEMENTS ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS.

FOREIGN CURRENCIES

ASSETS AND LIABILITIES RECORDED IN FOREIGN

CURRENCIES ARE TRANSLATED AT THE EXCHANGE RATE ON THE BALANCE SHEET DATE. REVENUE AND EXPENSES ARE TRANSLATED AT AVERAGE RATES OF EXCHANGE PREVAILING DURING THE YEAR. TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENTS RESULTING FROM THIS PROCESS ARE CHARGED OR CREDITED TO

OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (OCI).

REVENUE RECOGNITION

REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED WHEN PERSUASIVE EVIDENCE OF AN ARRANGEMENT EXISTS, DELIVERY HAS OCCURRED, THE

FEE IS FIXED OR DETERMINABLE, AND COLLECTIBILITY IS PROBABLE. WE ENTER INTO CERTAIN ARRANGEMENTS WHERE WE ARE OBLIGATED TO DELIVER MULTIPLE PRODUCTS AND/OR SERVICES (MULTIPLE ELEMENTS). IN THESE TRANSACTIONS, WE ALLOCATE THE TOTAL REVENUE AMONG THE

ELEMENTS BASED ON THE SALES PRICE OF EACH ELEMENT WHEN SOLD SEPARATELY (VENDOR-SPECIFIC OBJECTIVE EVIDENCE).

REVENUE FOR RETAIL PACKAGED PRODUCTS,

PRODUCTS LICENSED TO ORIGINAL EQUIPMENT MANUFACTURERS (OEMS), AND PERPETUAL LICENSES FOR CURRENT PRODUCTS UNDER OUR OPEN AND SELECT VOLUME LICENSING PROGRAMS GENERALLY IS RECOGNIZED AS PRODUCTS ARE SHIPPED, WITH A PORTION OF THE REVENUE RECORDED AS

UNEARNED DUE TO UNDELIVERED ELEMENTS INCLUDING, IN SOME CASES, FREE POST-DELIVERY TELEPHONE SUPPORT AND THE RIGHT TO RECEIVE UNSPECIFIED UPGRADES/ENHANCEMENTS OF MICROSOFT INTERNET EXPLORER ON A WHEN-AND-IF-AVAILABLE BASIS. THE AMOUNT OF REVENUE

ALLOCATED TO UNDELIVERED ELEMENTS IS BASED ON THE VENDOR-SPECIFIC OBJECTIVE EVIDENCE OF FAIR VALUE FOR THOSE ELEMENTS USING THE RESIDUAL METHOD. UNDER THE RESIDUAL METHOD, THE TOTAL FAIR VALUE OF THE UNDELIVERED ELEMENTS, AS INDICATED BY

VENDOR-SPECIFIC OBJECTIVE EVIDENCE, IS RECORDED AS UNEARNED, AND THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TOTAL ARRANGEMENT FEE AND THE AMOUNT RECORDED AS UNEARNED FOR THE UNDELIVERED ELEMENTS IS RECOGNIZED AS REVENUE RELATED TO DELIVERED ELEMENTS. UNEARNED

REVENUE DUE TO UNDELIVERED ELEMENTS IS RECOGNIZED RATABLY ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THE RELATED PRODUCTS LIFE CYCLE.

REVENUE FROM

MULTI-YEAR LICENSING ARRANGEMENTS ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AS SUBSCRIPTIONS, WITH BILLINGS RECORDED AS UNEARNED REVENUE AND RECOGNIZED AS REVENUE RATABLY OVER THE BILLING COVERAGE PERIOD. CERTAIN MULTI-YEAR LICENSING ARRANGEMENTS INCLUDE RIGHTS TO RECEIVE

FUTURE VERSIONS OF SOFTWARE PRODUCT ON A WHEN-AND-IF-AVAILABLE BASIS UNDER OPEN AND SELECT VOLUME LICENSING PROGRAMS (CURRENTLY NAMED SOFTWARE ASSURANCE AND, PREVIOUSLY NAMED UPGRADE ADVANTAGE). IN ADDITION, OTHER MULTI-YEAR LICENSING ARRANGEMENTS

INCLUDE A PERPETUAL LICENSE FOR CURRENT PRODUCTS COMBINED WITH RIGHTS TO RECEIVE FUTURE VERSIONS OF SOFTWARE PRODUCTS ON A WHEN-AND-IF-AVAILABLE BASIS UNDER OPEN, SELECT, AND ENTERPRISE AGREEMENT VOLUME LICENSING PROGRAMS. PREMIER SUPPORT SERVICES

AGREEMENTS, MSN INTERNET ACCESS SUBSCRIPTIONS, XBOX LIVE, MICROSOFT BCENTRAL SUBSCRIPTIONS, AND MICROSOFT DEVELOPER NETWORK SUBSCRIPTIONS ARE ALSO ACCOUNTED FOR AS SUBSCRIPTIONS.

REVENUE RELATED TO OUR XBOX GAME CONSOLE IS RECOGNIZED

UPON SHIPMENT OF THE PRODUCT TO RETAILERS. REVENUE RELATED TO GAMES PUBLISHED BY US IS RECOGNIZED WHEN THOSE GAMES HAVE BEEN DELIVERED TO RETAILERS NET OF ALLOWANCES FOR RETURNS AND PRICE CONCESSIONS. REVENUE RELATED TO GAMES PUBLISHED BY THIRD

PARTIES FOR USE ON THE XBOX PLATFORM IS RECOGNIZED WHEN MANUFACTURED FOR THE GAME PUBLISHERS. ONLINE ADVERTISING REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED AS ADVERTISEMENTS ARE DISPLAYED. SEARCH ADVERTISING REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED WHEN THE AD APPEARS IN THE SEARCH

RESULTS OR WHEN THE ACTION NECESSARY TO EARN THE REVENUE HAS BEEN COMPLETED. CONSULTING SERVICES REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED AS SERVICES ARE RENDERED, GENERALLY BASED ON THE NEGOTIATED HOURLY RATE IN THE CONSULTING ARRANGEMENT AND THE NUMBER OF HOURS

WORKED DURING THE PERIOD.

COSTS RELATED TO INSIGNIFICANT OBLIGATIONS, WHICH INCLUDE TELEPHONE SUPPORT FOR DEVELOPER TOOLS SOFTWARE, PC GAMES,

COMPUTER HARDWARE, AND XBOX, ARE ACCRUED WHEN THE RELATED REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED. PROVISIONS ARE RECORDED FOR ESTIMATED RETURNS, CONCESSIONS, AND BAD DEBTS.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES INCLUDE PAYROLL, EMPLOYEE BENEFITS, EQUITY COMPENSATION, AND OTHER HEADCOUNT-RELATED COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT. WE HAVE DETERMINED

THAT TECHNOLOGICAL FEASIBILITY FOR OUR SOFTWARE PRODUCTS IS REACHED SHORTLY BEFORE THE PRODUCTS ARE RELEASED TO MANUFACTURING. COSTS INCURRED AFTER TECHNOLOGICAL FEASIBILITY IS ESTABLISHED ARE NOT MATERIAL, AND ACCORDINGLY, WE EXPENSE ALL RESEARCH

AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS WHEN INCURRED.

SALES AND MARKETING

SALES AND MARKETING EXPENSES INCLUDE PAYROLL, EMPLOYEE BENEFITS, EQUITY

COMPENSATION, AND OTHER HEADCOUNT-RELATED COSTS AS WELL AS EXPENSES RELATED TO ADVERTISING, PROMOTIONS, TRADESHOWS, SEMINARS, AND OTHER PROGRAMS. ADVERTISING COSTS ARE EXPENSED AS INCURRED. ADVERTISING EXPENSE WAS $1.13 BILLION IN FISCAL 2002, $1.06

BILLION IN FISCAL 2003, AND $904 MILLION IN FISCAL 2004.

INCOME TAXES

INCOME TAX EXPENSE INCLUDES U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL INCOME TAXES, PLUS THE PROVISION

FOR U.S. TAXES ON UNDISTRIBUTED EARNINGS OF INTERNATIONAL SUBSIDIARIES NOT DEEMED TO BE PERMANENTLY INVESTED. CERTAIN ITEMS OF INCOME AND EXPENSE ARE NOT REPORTED IN TAX RETURNS AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN THE SAME YEAR. THE TAX EFFECT OF SUCH

TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES IS REPORTED AS DEFERRED INCOME TAXES.

DERIVATIVE

AND FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

WE CONSIDER ALL HIGHLY LIQUID INTEREST-EARNING

INVESTMENTS WITH A MATURITY OF THREE MONTHS OR LESS AT THE DATE OF PURCHASE TO BE CASH EQUIVALENTS. INVESTMENTS WITH MATURITIES BEYOND ONE YEAR MAY BE CLASSIFIED AS SHORT-TERM BASED ON THEIR HIGHLY LIQUID NATURE AND BECAUSE SUCH MARKETABLE

SECURITIES REPRESENT THE INVESTMENT OF CASH THAT IS AVAILABLE FOR CURRENT OPERATIONS. ALL CASH AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS ARE CLASSIFIED AS AVAILABLE FOR SALE AND ARE RECORDED AT MARKET VALUE USING THE SPECIFIC IDENTIFICATION METHOD; UNREALIZED

GAINS AND LOSSES (EXCLUDING OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENTS) ARE REFLECTED IN OCI.

EQUITY AND OTHER INVESTMENTS INCLUDE BOTH DEBT AND EQUITY

INSTRUMENTS. DEBT SECURITIES AND PUBLICLY TRADED EQUITY SECURITIES ARE CLASSIFIED AS AVAILABLE FOR SALE AND ARE RECORDED AT MARKET USING THE SPECIFIC IDENTIFICATION METHOD. UNREALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES (EXCLUDING OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENTS) ARE

REFLECTED IN OCI. ALL OTHER INVESTMENTS, EXCLUDING THOSE ACCOUNTED FOR USING THE EQUITY METHOD, ARE RECORDED AT COST.

WE LEND CERTAIN FIXED INCOME

AND EQUITY SECURITIES TO ENHANCE INVESTMENT INCOME. COLLATERAL AND/OR SECURITY INTEREST IS DETERMINED BASED UPON THE UNDERLYING SECURITY AND THE CREDITWORTHINESS OF THE BORROWER. THE FAIR VALUE OF COLLATERAL THAT WE ARE PERMITTED TO SELL OR REPLEDGE

WAS $499 MILLION AT BOTH JUNE 30, 2003 AND 2004.

INVESTMENTS ARE CONSIDERED TO BE IMPAIRED WHEN A DECLINE IN FAIR VALUE IS JUDGED TO BE

OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY. WE EMPLOY A SYSTEMATIC METHODOLOGY THAT CONSIDERS AVAILABLE EVIDENCE IN EVALUATING POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT OF OUR INVESTMENTS ON A QUARTERLY BASIS. IF THE COST OF AN INVESTMENT EXCEEDS ITS FAIR VALUE, WE EVALUATE, AMONG OTHER

FACTORS, GENERAL MARKET CONDITIONS, THE DURATION AND EXTENT TO WHICH THE FAIR VALUE IS LESS THAN COST, AS WELL AS OUR INTENT AND ABILITY TO HOLD THE INVESTMENT. WE ALSO CONSIDER SPECIFIC ADVERSE CONDITIONS RELATED TO THE FINANCIAL HEALTH OF AND

BUSINESS OUTLOOK FOR THE INVESTEE, INCLUDING INDUSTRY AND SECTOR PERFORMANCE, CHANGES IN TECHNOLOGY, OPERATIONAL AND FINANCING CASH FLOW FACTORS, AND RATING AGENCY ACTIONS. ONCE A DECLINE IN FAIR VALUE IS DETERMINED TO BE OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY, AN

IMPAIRMENT CHARGE IS RECORDED AND A NEW COST BASIS IN THE INVESTMENT IS ESTABLISHED.

WE USE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS TO MANAGE EXPOSURES TO

FOREIGN CURRENCY, EQUITIES PRICE, INTEREST RATE, AND CREDIT RISKS. OUR OBJECTIVES FOR HOLDING DERIVATIVES INCLUDE REDUCING, ELIMINATING, AND EFFICIENTLY MANAGING THE ECONOMIC IMPACT OF THESE EXPOSURES AS EFFECTIVELY AS POSSIBLE. DERIVATIVE

INSTRUMENTS ARE RECOGNIZED AS EITHER ASSETS OR LIABILITIES AND ARE MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE. THE ACCOUNTING FOR CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF A DERIVATIVE DEPENDS ON THE INTENDED USE OF THE DERIVATIVE AND THE RESULTING DESIGNATION. FOR A DERIVATIVE

INSTRUMENT DESIGNATED AS A FAIR-VALUE HEDGE, THE GAIN OR LOSS IS RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS IN THE PERIOD OF CHANGE TOGETHER WITH THE OFFSETTING LOSS OR GAIN ON THE HEDGED ITEM ATTRIBUTED TO THE RISK BEING HEDGED. FOR A DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENT DESIGNATED

AS A CASH-FLOW HEDGE, THE EFFECTIVE PORTION OF THE DERIVATIVES GAIN OR LOSS IS INITIALLY REPORTED AS A COMPONENT OF OCI AND SUBSEQUENTLY RECLASSIFIED INTO EARNINGS WHEN THE HEDGED EXPOSURE AFFECTS EARNINGS. THE INEFFECTIVE PORTION OF THE GAIN

OR LOSS IS RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS. FOR OPTIONS DESIGNATED EITHER AS FAIR-VALUE OR CASH-FLOW HEDGES, CHANGES IN THE TIME VALUE ARE EXCLUDED FROM THE ASSESSMENT OF HEDGE EFFECTIVENESS AND ARE RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS. GAINS AND LOSSES FROM CHANGES IN

FAIR VALUES OF DERIVATIVES THAT ARE NOT DESIGNATED AS HEDGES FOR ACCOUNTING PURPOSES ARE RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS.

FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK.

CERTAIN FORECASTED TRANSACTIONS AND ASSETS ARE EXPOSED TO FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK. WE MONITOR OUR FOREIGN CURRENCY EXPOSURES

DAILY TO MAXIMIZE THE OVERALL EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR FOREIGN CURRENCY HEDGE POSITIONS. OPTIONS ARE USED TO HEDGE A PORTION OF FORECASTED INTERNATIONAL REVENUE FOR UP TO THREE YEARS IN THE FUTURE AND ARE DESIGNATED AS CASH-FLOW HEDGING INSTRUMENTS

UNDER STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS (SFAS) 133,

ACCOUNTING FOR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES

. PRINCIPAL CURRENCIES HEDGED INCLUDE THE EURO, JAPANESE YEN, BRITISH POUND, AND CANADIAN DOLLAR. CERTAIN NON-U.S.

DOLLAR DENOMINATED SECURITIES ARE HEDGED USING FOREIGN EXCHANGE FORWARD CONTRACTS THAT ARE DESIGNATED AS FAIR-VALUE HEDGING INSTRUMENTS UNDER SFAS 133.

CERTAIN OPTIONS AND FORWARDS NOT DESIGNATED AS HEDGING INSTRUMENTS UNDER SFAS 133 ARE ALSO

EQUITIES PRICE RISK.

EQUITY INVESTMENTS ARE SUBJECT TO MARKET PRICE RISK.

FROM TIME TO TIME, WE USE AND DESIGNATE OPTIONS TO HEDGE FAIR VALUES AND CASH FLOWS ON CERTAIN EQUITY SECURITIES. WE DETERMINE THE SECURITY, OR FORECASTED SALE THEREOF, SELECTED FOR HEDGING BY EVALUATING MARKET CONDITIONS, UP-FRONT COSTS, AND OTHER

RELEVANT FACTORS. ONCE ESTABLISHED, THE HEDGES ARE NOT DYNAMICALLY MANAGED OR TRADED, AND ARE GENERALLY NOT REMOVED UNTIL MATURITY. CERTAIN OPTIONS, FUTURES AND SWAP CONTRACTS, NOT DESIGNATED AS HEDGING INSTRUMENTS UNDER SFAS 133, ARE ALSO USED TO

MANAGE EQUITY EXPOSURES.

INTEREST RATE RISK.

FIXED-INCOME

SECURITIES ARE SUBJECT TO INTEREST RATE RISK. THE FIXED-INCOME PORTFOLIO IS DIVERSIFIED AND CONSISTS PRIMARILY OF INVESTMENT GRADE SECURITIES TO MINIMIZE CREDIT RISK. WE USE EXCHANGE-TRADED OPTION AND FUTURE CONTRACTS AND OVER-THE-COUNTER SWAP

CONTRACTS, NOT DESIGNATED AS HEDGING INSTRUMENTS UNDER SFAS 133, TO HEDGE INTEREST RATE RISK.

OTHER DERIVATIVES.

SWAP CONTRACTS, NOT DESIGNATED AS HEDGING INSTRUMENTS UNDER SFAS 133, ARE USED TO MANAGE EXPOSURES TO CREDIT RISKS. IN ADDITION, WE MAY INVEST IN WARRANTS TO PURCHASE SECURITIES OF OTHER

COMPANIES AS A STRATEGIC INVESTMENT. WARRANTS THAT CAN BE NET SHARE SETTLED ARE DEEMED DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND ARE NOT DESIGNATED AS HEDGING INSTRUMENTS. TO BE ANNOUNCED FORWARD PURCHASE COMMITMENTS OF MORTGAGE-BACKED ASSETS ARE ALSO

CONSIDERED DERIVATIVES IN CASES WHERE PHYSICAL DELIVERY OF THE ASSETS ARE NOT TAKEN AT THE EARLIEST AVAILABLE DELIVERY DATE. ALL DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS NOT DESIGNATED AS HEDGING INSTRUMENTS ARE RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE, WITH CHANGES IN VALUE

RECOGNIZED IN THE INCOME STATEMENT DURING THE PERIOD OF CHANGE.

AS DISCUSSED IN NOTE

13  EMPLOYEE STOCK AND SAVINGS PLANS, 344.6 MILLION OPTIONS WERE TRANSFERRED TO JPMORGAN CHASE BANK (JPMORGAN) UNDER THE STOCK OPTION TRANSFER PROGRAM. THE OPTIONS TRANSFERRED TO JPMORGAN WERE AMENDED AND RESTATED UPON TRANSFER TO

CONTAIN TERMS AND CONDITIONS TYPICAL OF EQUITY OPTION TRANSACTIONS ENTERED INTO BETWEEN SOPHISTICATED FINANCIAL COUNTERPARTIES AT ARMS LENGTH USING STANDARD TERMS AND DEFINITIONS FOR EQUITY DERIVATIVES. AS OF JUNE 30, 2004, THE OPTIONS HAVE

STRIKE PRICES RANGING FROM $33.03 TO $101.25 PER SHARE AND HAVE EXPIRATION DATES BETWEEN DECEMBER 2005 AND DECEMBER 2006.

OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS HAS

APPROVED A PROGRAM TO REPURCHASE SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK TO REDUCE THE DILUTIVE EFFECT OF OUR STOCK OPTION AND STOCK PURCHASE PLANS. A TOTAL OF 618 MILLION SHARES HAVE BEEN REPURCHASED ON OPEN MARKET TRANSACTIONS OVER THE LAST THREE FISCAL YEARS

FOR APPROXIMATELY $16.2 BILLION. WE REPURCHASED 256 MILLION SHARES FOR $6.9 BILLION, 238 MILLION SHARES FOR $5.9 BILLION, AND 124 MILLION SHARES FOR $3.4 BILLION IN FISCAL 2002, 2003, AND 2004, RESPECTIVELY. ADDITIONALLY, IN 2002, WE ACQUIRED 10.2

MILLION OF OUR SHARES AS A RESULT OF A STRUCTURED STOCK REPURCHASE TRANSACTION ENTERED INTO IN 2001, WHICH GAVE US THE RIGHT TO ACQUIRE SUCH SHARES IN EXCHANGE FOR AN UP-FRONT NET PAYMENT OF $264 MILLION. IN ANY PERIOD, CASH USED IN FINANCING

ACTIVITIES RELATED TO COMMON STOCK REPURCHASED MAY DIFFER FROM THE COMPARABLE CHANGE IN STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY, REFLECTING TIMING DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE RECOGNITION OF SHARE REPURCHASE TRANSACTIONS AND THEIR SETTLEMENT FOR CASH.

ON JANUARY 16 AND SEPTEMBER 12, 2003, OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS DECLARED ANNUAL DIVIDENDS ON OUR COMMON STOCK OF $0.08 AND $0.16 PER SHARE, RESPECTIVELY. THE DIVIDENDS

WERE PAID ON MARCH 7 AND NOVEMBER 7, 2003, RESPECTIVELY, TO SHAREHOLDERS OF RECORD AT THE CLOSE OF BUSINESS ON FEBRUARY 21, AND OCTOBER 17, 2003.

13    EMPLOYEE STOCK AND SAVINGS PLANS

EFFECTIVE JULY 1, 2003,

WE ADOPTED THE FAIR VALUE RECOGNITION PROVISIONS OF SFAS 123,

ACCOUNTING FOR STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION

, USING THE RETROACTIVE RESTATEMENT METHOD DESCRIBED IN SFAS 148,

ACCOUNTING FOR STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION  TRANSITION AND

DISCLOSURE

. UNDER THE FAIR VALUE RECOGNITION PROVISIONS OF SFAS 123, STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION COST IS MEASURED AT THE GRANT DATE BASED ON THE VALUE OF THE AWARD AND IS RECOGNIZED AS EXPENSE OVER THE VESTING PERIOD. IN CONNECTION WITH THE USE OF

THE RETROACTIVE RESTATEMENT METHOD, INCOME STATEMENT AMOUNTS HAVE BEEN RESTATED FOR FISCAL 2002 AND 2003 TO REFLECT RESULTS AS IF THE FAIR-VALUE METHOD OF SFAS 123 HAD BEEN APPLIED FROM ITS ORIGINAL EFFECTIVE DATE. TOTAL COMPENSATION COST RECOGNIZED

IN INCOME FOR STOCK-BASED EMPLOYEE COMPENSATION AWARDS WAS $3.78 BILLION IN FISCAL 2002, $3.75 BILLION IN FISCAL 2003, AND $5.73 BILLION IN FISCAL 2004. THE AMOUNTS FOR FISCAL 2004 INCLUDE $2.21 BILLION ($1.48 BILLION AFTER-TAX OR $0.14 PER DILUTED

SHARE) DUE TO THE COMPLETION OF THE EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTION TRANSFER PROGRAM.

EMPLOYEE

STOCK PURCHASE PLAN.

WE HAVE AN EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN FOR ALL ELIGIBLE EMPLOYEES. UNDER THE PLAN, SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK COULD BE PURCHASED AT SIX MONTH INTERVALS AT 85% OF THE LOWER OF THE FAIR MARKET VALUE ON

THE FIRST OR THE LAST DAY OF EACH SIX MONTH PERIOD. EMPLOYEES COULD PURCHASE SHARES HAVING A VALUE NOT EXCEEDING 15% OF THEIR GROSS COMPENSATION DURING AN OFFERING PERIOD. DURING FISCAL 2002, 2003, AND 2004 EMPLOYEES PURCHASED 10.8 MILLION SHARES,

15.2 MILLION SHARES, AND 16.7 MILLION SHARES AT AVERAGE PRICES OF $25.26, $22.56, AND $22.74 PER SHARE. AT JUNE 30, 2004, 175.5 MILLION SHARES WERE RESERVED FOR FUTURE ISSUANCE.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

PART II

ITEM 8

DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF FISCAL 2004, THE

ADMINISTRATIVE COMMITTEE UNDER THE PLAN APPROVED A CHANGE TO THE COMMON STOCK PURCHASE DISCOUNT AND APPROVED THE ELIMINATION OF THE RELATED LOOK BACK PERIOD AND A CHANGE TO QUARTERLY PURCHASE PERIODS. AS A RESULT, EFFECTIVE BEGINNING IN FISCAL 2005,

SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK MAY BE PURCHASED BY EMPLOYEES AT THREE MONTHS INTERVALS AT 90% OF THE FAIR MARKET VALUE ON THE LAST DAY OF EACH THREE MONTH PERIOD.

SAVINGS PLAN.

WE HAVE A SAVINGS PLAN IN THE UNITED STATES, THAT QUALIFIES UNDER SECTION 401(K) OF THE INTERNAL REVENUE CODE, AS WELL AS A NUMBER OF

SAVINGS PLANS IN INTERNATIONAL LOCATIONS. PARTICIPATING U.S. EMPLOYEES MAY CONTRIBUTE UP TO 25% OF THEIR PRETAX SALARY, BUT NOT MORE THAN STATUTORY LIMITS. WE CONTRIBUTE FIFTY CENTS FOR EACH DOLLAR A PARTICIPANT CONTRIBUTES IN THIS PLAN, WITH A

MAXIMUM CONTRIBUTION OF 3% OF A PARTICIPANTS EARNINGS. MATCHING CONTRIBUTIONS FOR ALL PLANS WERE $101 MILLION, $118 MILLION, AND $141 MILLION IN FISCAL 2002, 2003, AND 2004. MATCHING CONTRIBUTIONS ARE INVESTED PROPORTIONATE TO EACH

PARTICIPANTS VOLUNTARY CONTRIBUTIONS IN THE INVESTMENT OPTIONS PROVIDED UNDER THE PLAN. INVESTMENT OPTIONS IN THE U.S. PLAN INCLUDE MICROSOFT COMMON STOCK, BUT NEITHER PARTICIPANT NOR OUR MATCHING CONTRIBUTIONS ARE REQUIRED TO BE INVESTED IN

MICROSOFT COMMON STOCK.

STOCK PLANS.

IN FISCAL 2004

WE IMPLEMENTED CHANGES IN EMPLOYEE COMPENSATION DESIGNED TO HELP US CONTINUE TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN THE BEST EMPLOYEES, AND TO BETTER ALIGN EMPLOYEE INTERESTS WITH THOSE OF OUR SHAREHOLDERS.

IN FISCAL 2004, WE BEGAN GRANTING EMPLOYEES STOCK AWARDS INSTEAD OF STOCK OPTIONS. THE STOCK AWARD PROGRAM OFFERS EMPLOYEES THE OPPORTUNITY TO EARN SHARES OF OUR

STOCK OVER TIME, RATHER THAN OPTIONS THAT GIVE EMPLOYEES THE RIGHT TO PURCHASE STOCK AT A SET PRICE. WE ALSO COMPLETED AN EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTION TRANSFER PROGRAM IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2004 WHEREBY EMPLOYEES COULD ELECT TO TRANSFER ALL OF

THEIR VESTED AND UNVESTED STOCK OPTIONS WITH A STRIKE PRICE OF $33 OR HIGHER (ELIGIBLE OPTIONS) TO JPMORGAN. THE UNVESTED ELIGIBLE OPTIONS THAT WERE TRANSFERRED TO JPMORGAN BECAME VESTED UPON THE TRANSFER. THE PRICE PAID BY JPMORGAN FOR

THE TRANSFERRED OPTIONS WAS DETERMINED BY REFERENCE TO THE ARITHMETIC AVERAGE OF THE CLOSING PRICES OF MICROSOFT COMMON STOCK DURING THE PERIOD FROM NOVEMBER 14, 2003 TO DECEMBER 8, 2003, WHICH WAS $25.57.

A TOTAL OF 18,503 (51%) OF THE 36,539 ELIGIBLE EMPLOYEES ELECTED TO PARTICIPATE IN THE STOCK OPTION TRANSFER PROGRAM AND 344.6 MILLION (55%) OF THE 621.4 MILLION

ELIGIBLE OPTIONS WERE TENDERED. UNDER THE TERMS OF THE PROGRAM, JPMORGAN PAID US $382 MILLION FOR THE TRANSFERRED OPTIONS. WE MADE AN INITIAL PAYMENT OF $219 MILLION TO PARTICIPATING EMPLOYEES FOR THE TRANSFERRED OPTIONS, WITH A REMAINING PORTION TO

BE PAID IN ONE OR MORE PAYMENTS THAT ARE SUBJECT TO PARTICIPATING EMPLOYEES CONTINUED EMPLOYMENT OVER THE NEXT TWO OR THREE YEARS. THE OPTIONS THAT WERE TRANSFERRED TO JPMORGAN RESULTED IN STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE OF $2.21 BILLION

($1.48 BILLION AFTER-TAX OR $0.14 PER DILUTED SHARE) WHICH IS REFLECTED IN THE RESULTS OF FISCAL 2004. THIS EXPENSE CONSISTS OF THE UNRECOGNIZED COMPENSATION COSTS OF THE OPTIONS THAT WERE TRANSFERRED, LESS THE AMOUNTS PAYABLE APPLICABLE TO THOSE

PREVIOUSLY UNVESTED OPTIONS FOR WHICH PAYMENT IS CONTINGENT UPON CONTINUED EMPLOYMENT OF PARTICIPATING EMPLOYEES. THE CONTINGENT PAYMENTS APPLICABLE TO UNVESTED ELIGIBLE OPTIONS THAT ARE SUBJECT TO CONTINUED EMPLOYMENT OF PARTICIPATING EMPLOYEES

WILL BE RECOGNIZED AS COMPENSATION EXPENSE OVER THE VESTING PERIOD OF THE CONTINGENT PAYMENTS.

THE STOCK OPTION TRANSFER PROGRAM ALSO RESULTED IN A

DECREASE TO OUR LONG-TERM DEFERRED TAX ASSETS DUE TO THE EXCESS OF RECORDED COMPENSATION EXPENSE FOR THESE OPTIONS OVER THE RELATED TAX DEDUCTION REPORTED ON OUR TAX RETURN. FOR FISCAL 2004, DEFERRED TAX ASSETS WERE REDUCED BY APPROXIMATELY $2.01

BILLION WITH AN OFFSETTING REDUCTION IN PAID-IN CAPITAL, REFLECTING THE REDUCTION OF PREVIOUSLY RECORDED DEDUCTIONS REPORTED ON OUR TAX RETURN IN EXCESS OF STOCK BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE. A DESCRIPTION OF OUR STOCK PLANS FOLLOWS.

WE HAVE STOCK PLANS FOR DIRECTORS AND FOR OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, CONSULTANTS AND ADVISORS. THE PLANS PROVIDE FOR AWARDS OF STOCK OPTIONS AND STOCK AWARDS. AT JUNE 30,

2004, AN AGGREGATE OF 807 MILLION SHARES WERE AVAILABLE FOR FUTURE GRANT UNDER OUR STOCK PLANS. OUR PLANS UNDER WHICH AWARDS MAY BE ISSUED DO NOT CONTAIN SEPARATE LIMITATIONS ON THE NUMBER OF STOCK AWARDS; ALL 807 MILLION SHARES REMAINING AVAILABLE

FOR GRANT AT JUNE 30, 2004 COULD BE AWARDED AS STOCK AWARDS. IN ADDITION, AWARDS THAT EXPIRE OR ARE CANCELLED WITHOUT DELIVERY OF SHARES GENERALLY BECOME AVAILABLE FOR ISSUANCE UNDER THE PLANS. THE OPTIONS TRANSFERRED TO JPMORGAN HAVE BEEN REMOVED

FROM OUR PLANS; ANY OPTIONS TRANSFERRED TO JPMORGAN THAT EXPIRE WITHOUT BEING EXERCISED WILL NOT BECOME AVAILABLE FOR GRANT UNDER ANY OF OUR PLANS.

STOCK AWARDS AND SHARED PERFORMANCE STOCK AWARDS.

STOCK AWARDS ARE GRANTS THAT ENTITLE THE HOLDER TO SHARES OF COMMON STOCK AS THE AWARD VESTS.

DURING FISCAL 2004, 32.6 MILLION STOCK AWARDS WITH A WEIGHTED-AVERAGE FAIR VALUE OF $26.12 PER SHARE WERE GRANTED AND GENERALLY VEST RATABLY OVER A FIVE-YEAR PERIOD. APPROXIMATELY 787,000 STOCK AWARDS VESTED AND 1.1 MILLION STOCK AWARDS WERE

CANCELLED DURING FISCAL 2004.

ITEM 8

SHARED PERFORMANCE STOCK AWARDS ARE A FORM OF STOCK

AWARD IN WHICH THE NUMBER OF SHARES ULTIMATELY RECEIVED DEPENDS ON OUR PERFORMANCE AGAINST SPECIFIED PERFORMANCE TARGETS. THE PERFORMANCE PERIOD IS JULY 1, 2003 THROUGH JUNE 30, 2006 (JANUARY 1, 2004 THROUGH JUNE 30, 2006 FOR CERTAIN EXECUTIVE

OFFICERS). AT THE END OF THE PERFORMANCE PERIOD, THE NUMBER OF SHARES OF STOCK AND STOCK AWARDS ISSUED WILL BE DETERMINED BY ADJUSTING UPWARD OR DOWNWARD FROM THE TARGET IN A RANGE BETWEEN 33% AND 150% (0% TO 150% FOR CERTAIN EXECUTIVE OFFICERS).

THE FINAL PERFORMANCE PERCENTAGE ON WHICH THE PAYOUT WILL BE BASED, CONSIDERING PERFORMANCE METRICS ESTABLISHED FOR THE PERFORMANCE PERIOD, WILL BE DETERMINED BY THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OR A COMMITTEE OF THE BOARD IN ITS SOLE DISCRETION. SHARES OF

STOCK WILL BE ISSUED AT THE END OF THE PERFORMANCE PERIOD AND AS THE STOCK AWARDS VEST RATABLY OVER THE FOLLOWING TWO YEARS. IN FISCAL 2004, SHARED PERFORMANCE STOCK AWARDS REPRESENTING THE TARGETED NUMBER OF SHARES FOR THE PERFORMANCE PERIOD ENDING

JUNE 30, 2006 WERE GRANTED IN THE AGGREGATE AMOUNT OF 31.7 MILLION SHARES WITH A WEIGHTED AVERAGE FAIR VALUE OF $26.08 PER SHARE. BECAUSE THESE AWARDS COVER A THREE-YEAR PERIOD, SHARED PERFORMANCE STOCK AWARDS WILL ONLY BE AWARDED IN FISCAL 2005 AND

2006 TO NEWLY HIRED AND PROMOTED EMPLOYEES ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE SHARED PERFORMANCE STOCK AWARDS. NO SHARED PERFORMANCE STOCK AWARDS VESTED AND 1.2 MILLION SHARED PERFORMANCE STOCK AWARDS WERE CANCELLED DURING FISCAL 2004.

STOCK AWARDS AND SHARED PERFORMANCE STOCK AWARDS ARE AMORTIZED OVER 5 YEARS USING THE STRAIGHT LINE METHOD.

STOCK OPTIONS.

NONQUALIFIED STOCK OPTIONS HAVE BEEN GRANTED TO OUR

DIRECTORS UNDER OUR NON-EMPLOYEE DIRECTOR STOCK PLANS. NONQUALIFIED AND INCENTIVE STOCK OPTIONS HAVE BEEN GRANTED TO OUR OFFICERS AND EMPLOYEES UNDER OUR EMPLOYEE STOCK PLANS. OPTIONS GRANTED BEFORE 1995 GENERALLY VEST OVER FOUR AND ONE-HALF YEARS

AND EXPIRE TEN YEARS FROM THE DATE OF GRANT. OPTIONS GRANTED BETWEEN 1995 AND 2001 GENERALLY VEST OVER FOUR AND ONE-HALF YEARS AND EXPIRE SEVEN YEARS FROM THE DATE OF GRANT, WHILE CERTAIN OPTIONS VEST EITHER OVER FOUR AND ONE-HALF YEARS OR OVER

SEVEN AND ONE-HALF YEARS AND EXPIRE TEN YEARS FROM THE DATE OF GRANT. OPTIONS GRANTED AFTER 2001 VEST OVER FOUR AND ONE-HALF YEARS AND EXPIRE TEN YEARS FROM THE DATE OF GRANT. AT JUNE 30, 2004, STOCK OPTIONS FOR 569 MILLION SHARES WERE VESTED.

THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE BLACK-SCHOLES VALUE OF OPTIONS GRANTED UNDER THE STOCK PLANS DURING FISCAL 2002, 2003, AND 2004 WAS $15.79, $12.08, AND

$10.13, RESPECTIVELY. THE FAIR VALUE OF EACH OPTION GRANT IS ESTIMATED ON THE DATE OF GRANT USING THE BLACK-SCHOLES OPTION-PRICING MODEL WITH THE FOLLOWING WEIGHTED AVERAGE ASSUMPTIONS USED FOR GRANTS.

WE HAVE COMMITTED $129 MILLION FOR CONSTRUCTING

NEW BUILDINGS.

WE HAVE UNCONDITIONALLY GUARANTEED THE REPAYMENT OF CERTAIN JAPANESE YEN DENOMINATED BANK LOANS AND RELATED INTEREST AND FEES OF

JUPITER TELECOMMUNICATION, LTD., A JAPANESE CABLE COMPANY (JUPITER). THESE GUARANTEES AROSE ON FEBRUARY 1, 2003 IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE EXPIRATION OF PRIOR FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS, INCLUDING PREVIOUS GUARANTEES BY US. THE FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS WERE

ENTERED INTO BY JUPITER AS PART OF FINANCING ITS OPERATIONS. AS PART OF JUPITERS NEW FINANCING AGREEMENT, WE AGREED TO GUARANTEE REPAYMENT BY JUPITER OF THE LOANS OF APPROXIMATELY $51 MILLION. THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE AND THE CARRYING VALUE OF

THE GUARANTEES WAS $11 MILLION WHICH WAS ADDED TO THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE RELATED INVESTMENT. THE GUARANTEES ARE IN EFFECT UNTIL THE EARLIER OF REPAYMENT OF THE LOANS, INCLUDING ACCRUED INTEREST AND FEES, OR FEBRUARY 1, 2009. THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT OF

THE GUARANTEES IS LIMITED TO THE SUM OF THE TOTAL DUE AND UNPAID PRINCIPAL AMOUNTS, ACCRUED AND UNPAID INTEREST, AND ANY OTHER RELATED EXPENSES. ADDITIONALLY, THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT OF THE GUARANTEES, DENOMINATED IN JAPANESE YEN, WILL VARY BASED ON

FLUCTUATIONS IN FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES. IF WE WERE REQUIRED TO MAKE PAYMENTS UNDER THE GUARANTEES, WE MAY RECOVER ALL OR A PORTION OF THOSE PAYMENTS UPON LIQUIDATION OF THE JUPITERS ASSETS. THE PROCEEDS FROM SUCH LIQUIDATION CANNOT BE

ACCURATELY ESTIMATED DUE TO THE MULTITUDE OF FACTORS THAT WOULD AFFECT THE VALUATION AND REALIZATION OF THE PROCEEDS IN THE EVENT OF LIQUIDATION.

IN

CONNECTION WITH VARIOUS OPERATING LEASES, WE ISSUED RESIDUAL VALUE GUARANTEES, WHICH PROVIDE THAT IF WE DO NOT PURCHASE THE LEASED PROPERTY FROM THE LESSOR AT THE END OF THE LEASE TERM, THEN WE ARE LIABLE TO THE LESSOR FOR AN AMOUNT EQUAL TO THE

SHORTAGE (IF ANY) BETWEEN THE PROCEEDS FROM THE SALE OF THE PROPERTY AND AN AGREED VALUE. AS OF JUNE 30, 2004, THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT OF THE RESIDUAL VALUE GUARANTEES WAS APPROXIMATELY $271 MILLION. WE BELIEVE THAT PROCEEDS FROM THE SALE OF PROPERTIES

UNDER OPERATING LEASES WOULD EXCEED THE PAYMENT OBLIGATION AND THEREFORE NO LIABILITY TO US CURRENTLY EXISTS.

WE PROVIDE INDEMNIFICATIONS OF VARYING

SCOPE AND SIZE TO CERTAIN CUSTOMERS AGAINST CLAIMS OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY INFRINGEMENT MADE BY THIRD PARTIES ARISING FROM THE USE OF OUR PRODUCTS. IN ADDITION, WE ALSO PROVIDE INDEMNIFICATION AGAINST CREDIT RISK IN SEVERAL GEOGRAPHICAL LOCATIONS

TO OUR VOLUME LICENSE RESELLERS IN CASE THE RESELLERS FAIL TO COLLECT FROM THE END USER. DUE TO THE NATURE OF THE INDEMNIFICATION PROVIDED TO OUR RESELLERS, WE CAN NOT ESTIMATE THE FAIR VALUE, NOR DETERMINE THE TOTAL NOMINAL AMOUNT OF THE

INDEMNIFICATION. WE EVALUATE ESTIMATED LOSSES FOR SUCH INDEMNIFICATIONS UNDER SFAS 5,

ACCOUNTING FOR CONTINGENCIES

, AS INTERPRETED BY FIN 45. WE CONSIDER SUCH FACTORS AS THE DEGREE OF PROBABILITY OF AN UNFAVORABLE OUTCOME AND THE ABILITY TO

MAKE A REASONABLE ESTIMATE OF THE AMOUNT OF LOSS. TO DATE, WE HAVE NOT ENCOUNTERED MATERIAL COSTS AS A RESULT OF SUCH OBLIGATIONS AND HAVE NOT ACCRUED ANY LIABILITIES RELATED TO SUCH INDEMNIFICATIONS IN OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

OUR PRODUCT WARRANTY ACCRUAL REFLECTS MANAGEMENTS BEST ESTIMATE OF OUR PROBABLE LIABILITY UNDER ITS PRODUCT WARRANTIES (PRIMARILY RELATING TO THE XBOX

CONSOLE). WE DETERMINE THE WARRANTY ACCRUAL BASED ON KNOWN PRODUCT FAILURES (IF ANY), HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE, AND OTHER CURRENTLY AVAILABLE EVIDENCE. OUR WARRANTY ACCRUAL TOTALS $19 MILLION. THERE HAS BEEN NO SIGNIFICANT ACTIVITY IMPACTING THE

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR ANY PERIOD PRESENTED.

WE ARE THE DEFENDANT IN

U.S. V. MICROSOFT

AND

NEW YORK V. MICROSOFT

, COMPANION LAWSUITS FILED BY THE ANTITRUST DIVISION OF THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE (DOJ) AND A GROUP OF EIGHTEEN STATE ATTORNEYS GENERAL ALLEGING VIOLATIONS OF THE SHERMAN ACT AND VARIOUS

STATE ANTITRUST LAWS. AFTER THE TRIAL, THE DISTRICT COURT ENTERED FINDINGS OF FACT AND CONCLUSIONS OF LAW STATING THAT WE HAD VIOLATED SECTIONS 1 AND 2 OF THE SHERMAN ACT AND VARIOUS STATE ANTITRUST LAWS. A JUDGMENT WAS ENTERED ON JUNE 7, 2000

ORDERING, AMONG OTHER THINGS, OUR BREAKUP INTO TWO COMPANIES. ON JUNE 28, 2001, THE U.S. COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA CIRCUIT AFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART, AND VACATED THE JUDGMENT IN ITS ENTIRETY AND REMANDED THE CASE TO THE

DISTRICT COURT FOR A NEW TRIAL ON ONE SECTION 1 CLAIM AND FOR ENTRY OF A NEW JUDGMENT CONSISTENT WITH ITS RULING. IN ITS RULING, THE COURT OF APPEALS SUBSTANTIALLY NARROWED THE BASES OF LIABILITY FOUND BY THE DISTRICT COURT, BUT AFFIRMED SOME OF THE

DISTRICT COURTS CONCLUSIONS THAT WE HAD VIOLATED SECTION 2. WE ENTERED INTO A SETTLEMENT WITH THE UNITED STATES ON NOVEMBER 2, 2001. NINE STATES (NEW YORK, OHIO, ILLINOIS, KENTUCKY, LOUISIANA, MARYLAND, MICHIGAN, NORTH CAROLINA AND WISCONSIN)

AGREED TO SETTLE ON SUBSTANTIALLY THE SAME TERMS ON NOVEMBER 6, 2001. ON NOVEMBER 1, 2002, THE COURT APPROVED THE SETTLEMENT AS BEING IN THE PUBLIC INTEREST, CONDITIONED UPON THE PARTIES AGREEMENT TO A MODIFICATION TO ONE PROVISION RELATED TO

THE COURTS ONGOING JURISDICTION. TWO TRADE GROUPS UNSUCCESSFULLY SOUGHT TO INTERVENE TO CHALLENGE THE APPROVAL OF THE SETTLEMENT AND HAVE APPEALED. NINE STATES AND THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA CONTINUED TO LITIGATE THE REMEDIES PHASE OF

YORK V. MICROSOFT

. ON NOVEMBER 1, 2002, THE COURT ENTERED A FINAL JUDGMENT IN THIS PART OF THE LITIGATION THAT LARGELY MIRRORED THE SETTLEMENT BETWEEN US, THE DOJ AND THE SETTLING STATES, WITH SOME MODIFICATIONS AND A DIFFERENT REGIME FOR

ENFORCING COMPLIANCE. THE COURT DECLINED TO IMPOSE OTHER AND BROADER REMEDIES SOUGHT BY THE NON-SETTLING STATES. TWO STATES, MASSACHUSETTS AND WEST VIRGINIA, APPEALED FROM THIS DECISION. WEST VIRGINIA DISMISSED ITS APPEAL AS PART OF A SETTLEMENT

WITH US OF SEVERAL OTHER CASES. ON JUNE 30, 2004, THE U.S. COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE D.C. CIRCUIT UNANIMOUSLY AFFIRMED THE SETTLEMENT AND THE FINAL JUDGMENT.

EUROPEAN COMMISSION COMPETITION LAW MATTER.

ON MARCH 25, 2004 THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION ANNOUNCED A DECISION IN ITS COMPETITION LAW INVESTIGATION OF

MICROSOFT. THE COMMISSION CONCLUDED THAT WE INFRINGED EUROPEAN COMPETITION LAW BY REFUSING TO PROVIDE OUR COMPETITORS WITH LICENSES TO CERTAIN PROTOCOL TECHNOLOGY IN THE WINDOWS SERVER OPERATING SYSTEMS AND BY INCLUDING STREAMING MEDIA PLAYBACK

FUNCTIONALITY IN WINDOWS DESKTOP OPERATING SYSTEMS. THE COMMISSION ORDERED US TO MAKE THE RELEVANT LICENSES TO OUR TECHNOLOGY AVAILABLE TO OUR COMPETITORS AND TO DEVELOP AND MAKE AVAILABLE A VERSION OF THE WINDOWS DESKTOP OPERATING SYSTEM THAT DOES

NOT INCLUDE SPECIFIED SOFTWARE RELATING TO MEDIA PLAYBACK. THE DECISION ALSO IMPOSED A FINE OF



497 MILLION, WHICH RESULTED IN A

CHARGE OF



497 MILLION ($605 MILLION). WE FILED AN APPEAL OF THE DECISION TO THE COURT OF FIRST INSTANCE ON JUNE 6, 2004 AND WILL

SEEK INTERIM MEASURES SUSPENDING THE OPERATION OF CERTAIN PROVISIONS OF THE DECISION. WE CONTEST THE CONCLUSION THAT EUROPEAN COMPETITION LAW WAS INFRINGED AND WILL DEFEND OUR POSITION VIGOROUSLY. A HEARING ON OUR PETITION FOR INTERIM MEASURES WILL

BE HELD ON SEPTEMBER 30  OCTOBER 1, 2004. IN OTHER ONGOING INVESTIGATIONS, VARIOUS FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS AND SEVERAL STATE ATTORNEYS GENERAL HAVE REQUESTED INFORMATION FROM US CONCERNING COMPETITION, PRIVACY, AND SECURITY ISSUES.

ANTITRUST, UNFAIR COMPETITION AND OVERCHARGE CLASS ACTIONS.

A LARGE

NUMBER OF ANTITRUST AND UNFAIR COMPETITION CLASS ACTION LAWSUITS HAVE BEEN FILED AGAINST US IN VARIOUS STATE AND FEDERAL COURTS. THE FEDERAL CASES HAVE BEEN CONSOLIDATED IN THE U.S. DISTRICT COURT FOR MARYLAND. THESE CASES ALLEGE THAT WE HAVE

COMPETED UNFAIRLY AND UNLAWFULLY MONOPOLIZED ALLEGED MARKETS FOR OPERATING SYSTEMS AND CERTAIN SOFTWARE APPLICATIONS, AND THEY SEEK TO RECOVER ON BEHALF OF VARIOUSLY DEFINED CLASSES OF DIRECT AND INDIRECT PURCHASERS ALLEGED OVERCHARGES FOR

THESE PRODUCTS. TO DATE, COURTS HAVE DISMISSED ALL CLAIMS FOR DAMAGES BROUGHT AGAINST US BY INDIRECT PURCHASERS UNDER FEDERAL LAW AND IN 14 STATES. NINE OF THOSE STATE COURT DECISIONS HAVE BEEN AFFIRMED ON APPEAL. CLAIMS ON BEHALF OF FOREIGN

PURCHASERS HAVE ALSO BEEN DISMISSED BY THE FEDERAL COURT IN MARYLAND. APPEALS OF THESE STATE RULINGS ARE PENDING IN TWO STATES. COURTS IN ELEVEN STATES HAVE RULED THAT THESE CASES MAY PROCEED AS CLASS ACTIONS, WHILE COURTS IN TWO STATES HAVE DENIED

CLASS CERTIFICATION. THE MARYLAND FEDERAL DISTRICT COURT HAS CERTIFIED A CLASS OF DIRECT PURCHASERS OF CERTAIN OF OUR OPERATING SYSTEM SOFTWARE THAT ACQUIRED THE SOFTWARE FROM THE SHOP.MICROSOFT.COM WEB SITE OR PURSUANT TO A DIRECT MARKETING

CAMPAIGN AND OTHERWISE DENIED CERTIFICATION OF THE PROPOSED CLASSES. THE DENIAL OF CERTIFICATION OF THE PROPOSED CLASSES HAS BEEN APPEALED AND THAT APPEAL IS STILL PENDING. MEMBERS OF THE CERTIFIED CLASS LICENSED FEWER THAN 550,000 COPIES OF

AT-ISSUE OPERATING SYSTEM SOFTWARE FROM US. IN SEPTEMBER 2003, WE REACHED AN AGREEMENT WITH PLAINTIFFS COUNSEL TO SETTLE THAT ACTION, WHICH RECEIVED FINAL APPROVAL IN APRIL 2004. IN 2003, WE REACHED AN AGREEMENT WITH COUNSEL FOR THE CALIFORNIA

PLAINTIFFS TO SETTLE ALL CLAIMS IN 27 CONSOLIDATED CASES IN THAT STATE. UNDER THE PROPOSED SETTLEMENT, CLASS MEMBERS WILL BE ABLE TO OBTAIN VOUCHERS ON A

CLAIMS MADE BASIS THAT ENTITLE THE CLASS MEMBERS TO BE REIMBURSED UP TO

THE FACE VALUE OF THEIR VOUCHERS FOR PURCHASES OF A WIDE VARIETY OF PLATFORM-NEUTRAL COMPUTER HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE. THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF VOUCHERS ISSUED WILL DEPEND ON THE NUMBER OF CLASS MEMBERS WHO CLAIM AND ARE ISSUED VOUCHERS. TWO-THIRDS OF THE

AMOUNT OF VOUCHERS UNISSUED OR UNREDEEMED BY CLASS MEMBERS WILL BE MADE AVAILABLE TO CERTAIN SCHOOLS IN CALIFORNIA IN THE FORM OF VOUCHERS THAT ALSO MAY BE REDEEMED FOR CASH AGAINST PURCHASES OF A WIDE VARIETY OF PLATFORM-NEUTRAL COMPUTER HARDWARE,

SOFTWARE AND RELATED SERVICES. SINCE THE BEGINNING OF 2003, WE ALSO REACHED SIMILAR AGREEMENTS TO SETTLE ALL CLAIMS IN A NUMBER OF OTHER STATES. THE PROPOSED SETTLEMENTS IN THESE STATES ARE STRUCTURED SIMILARLY TO THE CALIFORNIA SETTLEMENT, EXCEPT

THAT, AMONG OTHER DIFFERENCES, ONE-HALF OF THE AMOUNTS OF VOUCHERS UNISSUED TO CLASS MEMBERS WILL BE MADE AVAILABLE TO CERTAIN SCHOOLS IN THE RELEVANT STATES. THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT OF VOUCHERS TO BE ISSUED IN THESE SETTLEMENTS, INCLUDING THE CALIFORNIA

SETTLEMENT, IS $1.55 BILLION. THE ACTUAL COSTS OF THESE SETTLEMENTS WILL BE LESS THAN THAT MAXIMUM AMOUNT, DEPENDING ON THE NUMBER OF CLASS MEMBERS AND SCHOOLS WHO ARE ISSUED AND REDEEM VOUCHERS. THE SETTLEMENTS IN CALIFORNIA, FLORIDA, KANSAS,

MONTANA, NORTH CAROLINA, NORTH DAKOTA, SOUTH DAKOTA, TENNESSEE AND WEST VIRGINIA HAVE RECEIVED FINAL APPROVAL BY THE RELEVANT COURT. THE PROPOSED SETTLEMENTS IN ARIZONA, THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA, MASSACHUSETTS, MINNESOTA, NEW MEXICO AND VERMONT HAVE

RECEIVED PRELIMINARY APPROVAL BY THE COURTS IN THOSE STATES, BUT STILL REQUIRE FINAL APPROVAL. WE ESTIMATE THE TOTAL COST TO RESOLVE ALL OF THESE CASES WILL RANGE BETWEEN $1.1 BILLION AND $1.2 BILLION WITH THE ACTUAL COST DEPENDENT UPON MANY UNKNOWN

FACTORS SUCH AS THE QUANTITY AND MIX OF PRODUCTS FOR WHICH CLAIMS WILL BE MADE, THE NUMBER OF ELIGIBLE CLASS MEMBERS WHO ULTIMATELY USE THE VOUCHERS, THE NATURE OF HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE THAT IS ACQUIRED USING THE VOUCHERS, AND THE COST OF

ADMINISTERING THE CLAIMS PROCESS. IN ACCORDANCE WITH SFAS 5,

REALNETWORKS LITIGATION.

ON

DECEMBER 18, 2003, REALNETWORKS, INC. FILED SUIT AGAINST US ALLEGING VIOLATIONS OF FEDERAL AND STATE ANTITRUST AND UNFAIR COMPETITION LAWS, RELATED TO STREAMING MEDIA FEATURES OF WINDOWS AND RELATED TECHNOLOGIES. REALNETWORKS SEEKS DAMAGES AND

INJUNCTIVE RELIEF, INCLUDING A PERMANENT INJUNCTION REQUIRING US TO OFFER A VERSION OF WINDOWS PRODUCTS WITH NO STREAMING MEDIA FEATURES. WE DENY THE ALLEGATIONS AND WILL VIGOROUSLY DEFEND THE ACTION. REALNETWORKS FILED THE CASE IN FEDERAL COURT IN

SAN JOSE, CALIFORNIA. IT HAS BEEN CONSOLIDATED FOR PRETRIAL PURPOSES WITH OTHER CASES PENDING IN THE U.S. DISTRICT COURT IN BALTIMORE.

PATENT CASES.

WE ARE THE DEFENDANT IN MORE THAN 30 PATENT INFRINGEMENT CASES THAT WE ARE DEFENDING VIGOROUSLY. IN THE CASE OF

EOLAS TECHNOLOGIES,

INC. AND UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA V. MICROSOFT

, FILED IN THE U.S. DISTRICT COURT FOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF ILLINOIS ON FEBRUARY 2, 1999, THE PLAINTIFFS ACCUSED THE BROWSER FUNCTIONALITY OF WINDOWS OF INFRINGEMENT. ON AUGUST 11, 2003, THE JURY

AWARDED THE PLAINTIFFS APPROXIMATELY $520 MILLION IN DAMAGES FOR INFRINGEMENT FROM THE DATE THE PLAINTIFFS PATENT ISSUED THROUGH SEPTEMBER 2001. THE PLAINTIFFS ARE SEEKING AN EQUITABLE ACCOUNTING FOR DAMAGES FROM SEPTEMBER 2001 TO THE PRESENT.

ON JANUARY 14, 2004, THE TRIAL COURT ENTERED FINAL JUDGMENT OF $565 MILLION, INCLUDING POST-TRIAL INTEREST OF $45 MILLION, AND ENTERED AN INJUNCTION AGAINST DISTRIBUTION OF ANY NEW PRODUCTS, BUT STAYED EXECUTION OF THE JUDGMENT AND THE INJUNCTION

PENDING OUR APPEAL. WE FILED OUR NOTICE OF APPEAL ON FEBRUARY 12, 2004. ON OCTOBER 30, 2003, THE U.S. PATENT OFFICE ISSUED A LETTER STATING THAT IT HAS INITIATED A DIRECTOR-ORDERED RE-EXAMINATION OF THE EOLAS PATENT. ON FEBRUARY 26, 2004, PURSUANT

TO THIS RE-EXAMINATION PROCEEDING, THE PATENT OFFICE ISSUED AN OFFICE ACTION REJECTING THE CLAIMS OF THE EOLAS PATENT. WE BELIEVE THE TOTAL COST TO RESOLVE THIS CASE WILL NOT BE MATERIAL TO OUR FINANCIAL POSITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. THE ACTUAL

COSTS ARE DEPENDENT UPON MANY UNKNOWN FACTORS SUCH AS SUCCESS ON APPEAL AND THE EVENTS OF A RETRIAL OF THE CASE SHOULD THE CASE BE REMANDED TO TRIAL FOLLOWING APPEAL. IN

SUN MICROSYSTEMS AGREEMENTS.

ON APRIL 1,

2004, WE ENTERED INTO A SERIES OF AGREEMENTS WITH SUN MICROSYSTEMS, INC. TO RESOLVE ALL PENDING LITIGATION BETWEEN THE PARTIES, ATTEMPT TO AVOID FUTURE DISPUTES, AND CREATE AN ENVIRONMENT CONDUCIVE TO FUTURE COOPERATION. THESE AGREEMENTS INCLUDED A

SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT, A PATENT COVENANT AND STANDSTILL AGREEMENT, AND A TECHNOLOGY COLLABORATION AGREEMENT. PURSUANT TO THE AGREEMENTS, WE MADE PAYMENTS TOTALING $1.95 BILLION TO SUN.

IN THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT, SUN AGREED TO DISCONTINUE ITS PARTICIPATION IN PROCEEDINGS PENDING AGAINST MICROSOFT INSTITUTED BY THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN

COMMUNITIES AND AGREED TO DISMISS WITH PREJUDICE THE ACTION IT FILED IN THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA,

SUN MICROSYSTEMS, INC. V. MICROSOFT CORP.

, CIVIL ACTION NO. C-02-01150 RMW (PVT) (N.D. CAL.), AND LATER TRANSFERRED TO THE UNITED

STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF MARYLAND UNDER MDL DOCKET NO. 1332. SUN RELEASED MICROSOFT FROM ANY CLAIMS THAT WERE OR COULD HAVE BEEN ASSERTED IN THE PROCEEDINGS PENDING BEFORE THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, ITS ACTION PENDING IN THE U.S.,

AND ANY CLAIMS BASED ON ANY ACTIONS OR EVENTS DISCUSSED IN THE FINDINGS OF FACT IN

UNITED STATES V. MICROSOFT CORP.

AND

NEW YORK, ET AL. V MICROSOFT CORP.

, 84 F. SUPP. 2D 9 (D.D.C. 2002). PURSUANT TO THE TERMS OF THE SETTLEMENT

AGREEMENT, MICROSOFT PAID SUN $700 MILLION, WHICH WAS RECORDED AS LITIGATION RELATED EXPENSE.

THE PATENT COVENANT AND STANDSTILL AGREEMENT PROVIDES

THAT NEITHER SUN NOR MICROSOFT WILL SUE THE OTHER, OR CERTAIN AUTHORIZED CHANNEL AND END USER LICENSEES, FOR DAMAGES FOR PAST PATENT INFRINGEMENT. MICROSOFT HAS THE OPTION OF EXTENDING THIS COVENANT NOT TO SUE EACH YEAR UNTIL 2014 IN EXCHANGE FOR AN

ANNUAL EXTENSION PAYMENT, SO LONG AS CERTAIN CONDITIONS ARE MET. THE AGREEMENT PROVIDES THAT ON APRIL 1, 2014, PROVIDED THAT CERTAIN CONDITIONS ARE MET, THE COMPANIES WILL GRANT EACH OTHER IRREVOCABLE, NON-EXCLUSIVE, PERPETUAL PATENT LICENSES, WITH

SOME RECIPROCAL LIMITATIONS AS TO SCOPE AND USE, AS WELL AS AN ADDITIONAL TEN YEAR COVENANT NOT TO SUE FOR PATENT INFRINGEMENT WITH RESPECT TO CERTAIN PRODUCTS. PURSUANT TO THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT, MICROSOFT PAID SUN $900 MILLION, WHICH WAS

RECORDED AS LITIGATION RELATED EXPENSE.

SUN AND MICROSOFT ALSO ENTERED INTO A RECIPROCAL TECHNOLOGY COLLABORATION AGREEMENT. THIS COLLABORATION

AGREEMENT PROVIDES BOTH COMPANIES WITH ACCESS TO ASPECTS OF EACH OTHERS SERVER-BASED TECHNOLOGY FOR USE IN DEVELOPING NEW SERVER SOFTWARE PRODUCTS AND/OR ENHANCING EXISTING SERVER SOFTWARE PRODUCTS, IN ORDER TO IMPROVE INTEROPERABILITY. IT

PROVIDES A PERPETUAL LICENSE BETWEEN MICROSOFT AND SUN PURSUANT TO ALL SUBJECT INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS (INCLUDING PATENTS AND TRADE SECRETS) TO ENABLE EITHER COMPANY TO IMPLEMENT IN ITS SERVER OPERATING SYSTEM PRODUCTS ANY SERVER-BASED

COMMUNICATIONS PROTOCOLS THAT ARE IMPLEMENTED OVER A SEVEN YEAR PERIOD BY THE OTHER COMPANY IN ORDER TO INTEROPERATE WITH THEIR RESPECTIVELY IDENTIFIED SERVER AND/OR CLIENT OPERATING SYSTEM PRODUCTS. ROYALTY OBLIGATIONS INCURRED BY MICROSOFT FOR USE

OR INCLUSION OF COVERED SUN TECHNOLOGY IN MICROSOFT PRODUCTS WILL, AS INCURRED, BE CREDITED AGAINST THE $350 MILLION ALREADY PAID PURSUANT TO THE TERMS OF THE TECHNOLOGY COLLABORATION AGREEMENT, BASED ON ROYALTY RATES TO BE DETERMINED IN THE FUTURE

BY SUN. THIS LICENSE REMOVES CONCERNS UNDER TRADITIONAL PATENT AND TRADE SECRET INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY FRAMEWORKS BY ENABLING MICROSOFTS CURRENT AND FUTURE CLIENT AND SERVER OPERATING SYSTEM PRODUCTS TO INTEROPERATE WITH THE MOST POPULAR SUN

PRODUCTS IN A WIDE RANGE OF CUSTOMER COMPUTING ENVIRONMENTS.

THE EXTENT AND TIMING OF MICROSOFTS CONSUMPTION OF THIS CREDIT IS SUBJECT TO

UNCERTAINTY. MUCH OF THE TECHNOLOGY THAT THE COMPANIES AGREED TO LICENSE TO EACH OTHER DOES NOT EXIST IN A USEABLE FORM AND THE AGREEMENT DOES NOT SPECIFY INDIVIDUAL ROYALTY PAYMENTS FOR IMPLEMENTATION OF SPECIFICATIONS FOR PARTICULAR COMMUNICATIONS

PROTOCOLS. AFTER REACHING THIS AGREEMENT WITH SUN, WE VALUED THE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS RECEIVED. IN DETERMINING THE FAIR VALUE OF THE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RECEIVED, WE CONSIDERED THE UNCERTAINTY ASSOCIATED WITH THE TIMING AND LIKELY USE OF

SUNS TECHNOLOGY, WHICH INCLUDED ESTIMATING THE LIKELIHOOD OF ADOPTION OF PROTOCOLS AND POTENTIAL ROYALTIES SAVED. THAT VALUATION RESULTED IN A FAIR VALUE OF $29 MILLION FOR THE RIGHT TO USE SUNS LICENSED PROTOCOLS IN CERTAIN PRODUCTS,

WHICH WE RECORDED AS AN INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY ASSET. REFLECTING THE UNCERTAINTY ASSOCIATED WITH THE TIMING AND LIKELY USE OF SUNS TECHNOLOGY, THE REMAINING AMOUNT OF $321 MILLION WAS RECORDED AS LITIGATION RELATED EXPENSE.

INTERTRUST SETTLEMENT.

ON APRIL 3, 2004, THE PREVIOUSLY REPORTED CASE OF

INTERTRUST V. MICROSOFT

WAS SETTLED BY AGREEMENT OF THE PARTIES. UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT, WE HAVE TAKEN A COMPREHENSIVE LICENSE TO INTERTRUSTS PATENT PORTFOLIO, INCLUDING PENDING PATENT APPLICATIONS, AND AGREED TO MAKE A

ONE-TIME PAYMENT TO INTERTRUST OF $440 MILLION. THE AGREEMENT INVOLVED A COMBINATION OF A LICENSE OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY ASSETS FOR WHICH WE RECORDED AN INTANGIBLE ASSET OF $266 MILLION AND A PAYMENT OF $174 MILLION FOR SETTLEMENT OF LEGAL CLAIMS.

OF THE TOTAL PAYMENT, $174 MILLION WAS RECOVERED THROUGH INSURANCE AND HAD NO IMPACT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. THE AGREEMENT RESOLVES ALL OUTSTANDING LITIGATION BETWEEN THE PARTIES.

OTHER.

WE ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO A VARIETY OF OTHER CLAIMS AND SUITS THAT ARISE FROM TIME TO TIME IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF

OUR BUSINESS. WHILE MANAGEMENT CURRENTLY BELIEVES THAT RESOLVING ALL OF THESE MATTERS, INDIVIDUALLY OR IN AGGREGATE, WILL NOT HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR FINANCIAL POSITION OR OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, THE LITIGATION AND OTHER CLAIMS

NOTED ABOVE ARE SUBJECT TO INHERENT UNCERTAINTIES AND MANAGEMENTS VIEW OF THESE MATTERS MAY
