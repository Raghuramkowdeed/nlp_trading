OUR XBOX GAMING AND ENTERTAINMENT BUSINESS COMPETES WITH CONSOLE PLATFORMS FROM NINTENDO AND SONY, BOTH

THEIR GAME CONSOLES IN LATE 2006. WE BELIEVE THE SUCCESS OF GAMING AND ENTERTAINMENT CONSOLES IS DETERMINED BY THE AVAILABILITY OF GAMES FOR THE CONSOLE, PROVIDING EXCLUSIVE GAME CONTENT THAT GAMERS SEEK, THE COMPUTATIONAL POWER AND RELIABILITY OF

DURING FISCAL YEARS 2011, 2010, AND 2009, RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSE WAS $9.0 BILLION, $8.7 BILLION, AND $9.0 BILLION,

RESPECTIVELY. THESE AMOUNTS REPRESENTED 13%, 14%, AND 15%, RESPECTIVELY, OF REVENUE IN EACH OF THOSE YEARS. WE PLAN TO CONTINUE TO MAKE SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS IN A BROAD RANGE OF RESEARCH AND PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS.

PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

MOST OF OUR SOFTWARE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES ARE DEVELOPED INTERNALLY. INTERNAL DEVELOPMENT ALLOWS US TO MAINTAIN COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGES THAT COME FROM CLOSER TECHNICAL CONTROL OVER OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. IT ALSO

GIVES US THE FREEDOM TO DECIDE WHICH MODIFICATIONS AND ENHANCEMENTS ARE MOST IMPORTANT AND WHEN THEY SHOULD BE IMPLEMENTED. WE STRIVE TO OBTAIN INFORMATION AS EARLY AS POSSIBLE ABOUT CHANGING USAGE PATTERNS AND HARDWARE ADVANCES THAT MAY AFFECT

SOFTWARE DESIGN. BEFORE RELEASING NEW SOFTWARE PLATFORMS, WE PROVIDE APPLICATION VENDORS WITH A RANGE OF RESOURCES AND GUIDELINES FOR DEVELOPMENT, TRAINING, AND TESTING. GENERALLY, WE ALSO CREATE PRODUCT DOCUMENTATION INTERNALLY.

WE PROTECT OUR INVESTMENTS IN INNOVATION IN A VARIETY OF WAYS. WE WORK ACTIVELY IN THE U.S. AND INTERNATIONALLY TO ENSURE THE ENFORCEMENT OF

COPYRIGHT, TRADEMARK, TRADE SECRET, AND OTHER PROTECTIONS THAT APPLY TO OUR SOFTWARE PRODUCTS, SERVICES, BUSINESS PLANS, AND BRANDING. WE ARE A LEADER AMONG TECHNOLOGY COMPANIES IN PURSUING PATENTS AND CURRENTLY HAVE A PORTFOLIO OF OVER 26,000 U.S.

AND INTERNATIONAL PATENTS ISSUED AND OVER 36,000 PENDING. WHILE WE EMPLOY MANY OF OUR INNOVATIONS EXCLUSIVELY IN MICROSOFT PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, WE ALSO ENGAGE IN OUTBOUND AND INBOUND LICENSING OF SPECIFIC PATENTED TECHNOLOGIES THAT ARE

INCORPORATED INTO LICENSEES OR MICROSOFTS PRODUCTS. FROM TIME TO TIME, WE ENTER INTO BROADER CROSS-LICENSE AGREEMENTS WITH OTHER TECHNOLOGY COMPANIES COVERING ENTIRE GROUPS OF PATENTS. FROM TIME TO TIME, WE PURCHASE OR LICENSE TECHNOLOGY

THAT WE INCORPORATE IN OUR PRODUCTS OR SERVICES.

WHILE IT MAY BE NECESSARY IN THE FUTURE TO SEEK OR RENEW LICENSES RELATING TO VARIOUS

ASPECTS OF OUR PRODUCTS AND BUSINESS METHODS, WE BELIEVE, BASED UPON PAST EXPERIENCE AND INDUSTRY PRACTICE, SUCH LICENSES GENERALLY COULD BE OBTAINED ON COMMERCIALLY REASONABLE TERMS. WE BELIEVE OUR CONTINUING INNOVATION AND PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT ARE

NOT MATERIALLY DEPENDENT ON ANY SINGLE LICENSE OR OTHER AGREEMENT WITH A THIRD PARTY RELATING TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF OUR PRODUCTS.

INVESTING IN INNOVATION

INNOVATION IS THE FOUNDATION FOR MICROSOFTS SUCCESS. OUR MODEL FOR GROWTH IS BASED ON OUR ABILITY TO INITIATE AND EMBRACE DISRUPTIVE TECHNOLOGY TRENDS, TO ENTER NEW MARKETS, BOTH IN TERMS OF GEOGRAPHIES AND

PRODUCT AREAS, AND TO DRIVE BROAD ADOPTION OF THE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES WE DEVELOP AND MARKET. OUR INNOVATION INVESTMENTS FOCUS ON THE EMERGING TECHNOLOGY TRENDS AND BREAKTHROUGHS THAT WE BELIEVE OFFER SIGNIFICANT OPPORTUNITIES TO DELIVER VALUE TO

OUR CUSTOMERS AND GROWTH FOR THE COMPANY. WE MAINTAIN OUR LONG-TERM COMMITMENT TO RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ACROSS A WIDE SPECTRUM OF TECHNOLOGIES, TOOLS, AND PLATFORMS SPANNING COMMUNICATION AND COLLABORATION; INFORMATION ACCESS AND ORGANIZATION;

ENTERTAINMENT; BUSINESS AND E-COMMERCE; ADVERTISING; AND DEVICES.

WHILE OUR MAIN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT FACILITIES ARE LOCATED IN

REDMOND, WASHINGTON, WE ALSO OPERATE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT FACILITIES IN OTHER PARTS OF THE U.S. AND AROUND THE WORLD, INCLUDING CANADA, CHINA, DENMARK, ENGLAND, INDIA, IRELAND, AND ISRAEL. THIS GLOBAL APPROACH WILL HELP US REMAIN COMPETITIVE IN

LOCAL MARKETS AND ENABLE US TO CONTINUE TO ATTRACT TOP TALENT FROM ACROSS THE WORLD. WE GENERALLY FUND RESEARCH AT THE CORPORATE LEVEL TO ENSURE THAT WE ARE LOOKING BEYOND IMMEDIATE PRODUCT CONSIDERATIONS TO OPPORTUNITIES FURTHER IN THE FUTURE. WE

ALSO FUND RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES AT THE BUSINESS SEGMENT LEVEL. MANY OF THE INNOVATIONS CREATED BY OUR BUSINESS SEGMENTS ARE COORDINATED WITH OTHER SEGMENTS AND LEVERAGED ACROSS THE COMPANY.

IN ADDITION TO OUR MAIN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT OPERATIONS, WE ALSO OPERATE MICROSOFT RESEARCH. MICROSOFT RESEARCH IS ONE OF THE WORLDS

LARGEST COMPUTER SCIENCE RESEARCH ORGANIZATIONS, AND WORKS IN CLOSE COLLABORATION WITH TOP UNIVERSITIES AROUND THE WORLD TO ADVANCE THE STATE-OF-THE-ART IN COMPUTER SCIENCE, PROVIDING US A UNIQUE PERSPECTIVE ON FUTURE TECHNOLOGY TRENDS.

BASED ON OUR ASSESSMENT OF KEY TECHNOLOGY TRENDS AND OUR BROAD FOCUS ON LONG-TERM RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT OF NEW PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, AREAS

WHERE WE SEE SIGNIFICANT OPPORTUNITIES TO DRIVE FUTURE GROWTH INCLUDE SMART CONNECTED DEVICES, CLOUD COMPUTING, ENTERTAINMENT, SEARCH, COMMUNICATIONS, AND PRODUCTIVITY.

DISTRIBUTION, SALES, AND MARKETING

WE MARKET AND DISTRIBUTE OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES

PRIMARILY THROUGH THE FOLLOWING CHANNELS: OEM; DISTRIBUTORS AND RESELLERS; AND ONLINE.

OEM

WE DISTRIBUTE SOFTWARE THROUGH OEMS THAT PRE-INSTALL OUR SOFTWARE ON NEW PCS, SERVERS, SMARTPHONES, AND OTHER INTELLIGENT DEVICES THAT THEY SELL TO

END CUSTOMERS. THE LARGEST COMPONENT OF THE OEM BUSINESS IS THE WINDOWS OPERATING SYSTEM PRE-INSTALLED ON PCS. OEMS ALSO SELL HARDWARE PRE-INSTALLED WITH OTHER MICROSOFT PRODUCTS, INCLUDING SERVER OPERATING SYSTEMS AND APPLICATION PRODUCTS AND

DESKTOP APPLICATIONS SUCH AS OUR MICROSOFT OFFICE SUITE. IN ADDITION TO THESE PRODUCTS, WE ALSO MARKET THROUGH OEMS SOFTWARE SERVICES SUCH AS OUR WINDOWS LIVE ESSENTIALS SUITE.

THERE ARE TWO BROAD CATEGORIES OF OEMS. THE LARGEST OEMS, MANY OF WHICH OPERATE GLOBALLY, ARE REFERRED TO AS DIRECT OEMS, AS OUR

RELATIONSHIP WITH THEM IS MANAGED THROUGH A DIRECT AGREEMENT BETWEEN MICROSOFT AND THE MANUFACTURER. WE HAVE DISTRIBUTION AGREEMENTS COVERING ONE OR MORE OF OUR PRODUCTS WITH VIRTUALLY ALL OF THE MULTINATIONAL OEMS, INCLUDING ACER, ASUSTEK, DELL,

FUJITSU, HTC, HEWLETT-PACKARD, LG, LENOVO, NEC, NOKIA, SAMSUNG, SONY, TOSHIBA, AND WITH MANY REGIONAL AND LOCAL OEMS, INCLUDING MEDION, MSI, AND POSITIVO. THE SECOND BROAD CATEGORY OF OEMS CONSISTS OF LOWER-VOLUME PC MANUFACTURERS (ALSO CALLED

SYSTEM BUILDERS), WHICH SOURCE THEIR MICROSOFT SOFTWARE FOR PRE-INSTALLATION AND LOCAL REDISTRIBUTION PRIMARILY THROUGH THE MICROSOFT DISTRIBUTOR CHANNEL RATHER THAN THROUGH A DIRECT AGREEMENT OR RELATIONSHIP WITH MICROSOFT. SOME OF THE

DISTRIBUTORS IN THE MICROSOFT DISTRIBUTOR CHANNEL ARE GLOBAL, SUCH AS INGRAM MICRO AND TECH DATA, BUT MOST OPERATE AT A LOCAL OR REGIONAL LEVEL.

DISTRIBUTORS AND RESELLERS

MANY ORGANIZATIONS THAT LICENSE OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES THROUGH ENTERPRISE AGREEMENTS TRANSACT DIRECTLY WITH US, WITH SALES SUPPORT FROM SOLUTION INTEGRATORS, INDEPENDENT SOFTWARE VENDORS, WEB AGENCIES, AND

DEVELOPERS THAT ADVISE ORGANIZATIONS ON LICENSING OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES (ENTERPRISE SOFTWARE ADVISORS). ORGANIZATIONS ALSO LICENSE OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES INDIRECTLY, PRIMARILY THROUGH LARGE ACCOUNT RESELLERS (LARS),

DISTRIBUTORS, VALUE-ADDED RESELLERS (VARS), OEMS, SYSTEM BUILDER CHANNELS AND RETAILERS. ALTHOUGH EACH TYPE OF RESELLING PARTNER REACHES ORGANIZATIONS OF ALL SIZES, LARS ARE PRIMARILY ENGAGED WITH LARGE ORGANIZATIONS, DISTRIBUTORS RESELL

PRIMARILY TO VARS, AND VARS TYPICALLY REACH SMALL-SIZED AND MEDIUM-SIZED ORGANIZATIONS. ENTERPRISE SOFTWARE ADVISORS TYPICALLY ARE ALSO AUTHORIZED AS LARS AND OPERATE AS RESELLERS FOR OUR OTHER LICENSING PROGRAMS, SUCH AS THE SELECT AND OPEN

LICENSING PROGRAMS DISCUSSED UNDER LICENSING OPTIONS BELOW. SOME OF OUR DISTRIBUTORS INCLUDE INGRAM MICRO AND TECH DATA, AND SOME OF OUR LARGEST RESELLERS INCLUDE CDW, DELL, INSIGHT ENTERPRISES, AND SOFTWARE HOUSE INTERNATIONAL. OUR

MICROSOFT DYNAMICS SOFTWARE OFFERINGS ARE LICENSED TO ENTERPRISES THROUGH A GLOBAL NETWORK OF CHANNEL PARTNERS PROVIDING VERTICAL SOLUTIONS AND SPECIALIZED SERVICES. WE DISTRIBUTE OUR RETAIL PACKAGED PRODUCTS PRIMARILY THROUGH INDEPENDENT

NON-EXCLUSIVE DISTRIBUTORS, AUTHORIZED REPLICATORS, RESELLERS, AND RETAIL OUTLETS. INDIVIDUAL CONSUMERS OBTAIN THESE PRODUCTS PRIMARILY THROUGH RETAIL OUTLETS, SUCH AS WAL-MART AND DIXONS. WE HAVE A NETWORK OF FIELD SALES REPRESENTATIVES AND FIELD

SUPPORT PERSONNEL THAT SOLICITS ORDERS FROM DISTRIBUTORS AND RESELLERS, AND PROVIDES PRODUCT TRAINING AND SALES SUPPORT.

ONLINE

ALTHOUGH CLIENT-BASED SOFTWARE WILL CONTINUE TO BE AN IMPORTANT PART OF OUR BUSINESS, INCREASINGLY WE ARE DELIVERING ADDITIONAL VALUE TO CUSTOMERS

THROUGH CLOUD-BASED SERVICES. WE PROVIDE ONLINE CONTENT AND SERVICES TO CONSUMERS THROUGH BING, MSN PORTALS AND CHANNELS, MICROSOFT OFFICE WEB APPS, MICROSOFT SECURITY ESSENTIALS, WINDOWS LIVE ESSENTIALS SUITE, WINDOWS PHONE MARKETPLACE, XBOX LIVE,

AND ZUNE MARKETPLACE. WE PROVIDE CONTENT AND SERVICES TO BUSINESS USERS THROUGH THE MICROSOFT ONLINE SERVICES PLATFORM, WHICH INCLUDES CLOUD-BASED SERVICES SUCH AS BUSINESS PRODUCTIVITY ONLINE STANDARD SUITE, EXCHANGE ONLINE, MICROSOFT DYNAMICS CRM

ONLINE, MICROSOFT LYNC, MICROSOFT OFFICE 365, MICROSOFT OFFICE COMMUNICATIONS ONLINE, MICROSOFT OFFICE LIVE MEETING, SQL AZURE, SHAREPOINT ONLINE, WINDOWS AZURE, AND WINDOWS INTUNE. OTHER SERVICES DELIVERED ONLINE INCLUDE OUR ONLINE ADVERTISING

PLATFORM WITH OFFERINGS FOR ADVERTISERS, AS WELL AS MICROSOFT DEVELOPER NETWORKS SUBSCRIPTION CONTENT AND UPDATES, PERIODIC PRODUCT UPDATES, AND ONLINE TECHNICAL AND PRACTICE READINESS RESOURCES TO SUPPORT OUR PARTNERS IN DEVELOPING AND SELLING OUR

PRODUCTS AND SOLUTIONS.

LICENSING OPTIONS

WE LICENSE SOFTWARE TO ORGANIZATIONS UNDER ARRANGEMENTS THAT ALLOW THE END-USER CUSTOMER TO ACQUIRE MULTIPLE LICENSES OF PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. OUR ARRANGEMENTS FOR ORGANIZATIONS TO ACQUIRE MULTIPLE LICENSES OF

PRODUCTS AND SERVICES ARE DESIGNED TO PROVIDE THEM WITH A MEANS OF DOING SO WITHOUT HAVING TO ACQUIRE SEPARATE PACKAGED PRODUCT THROUGH RETAIL CHANNELS. IN DELIVERING ORGANIZATIONAL LICENSING ARRANGEMENTS TO THE MARKET, WE USE DIFFERENT PROGRAMS

DESIGNED TO PROVIDE FLEXIBILITY FOR ORGANIZATIONS OF VARIOUS SIZES. WHILE THESE PROGRAMS MAY DIFFER IN VARIOUS PARTS OF THE WORLD, GENERALLY THEY INCLUDE THOSE DISCUSSED BELOW.

OPEN LICENSING

DESIGNED PRIMARILY FOR SMALL-TO-MEDIUM ORGANIZATIONS (5 TO OVER 250 LICENSES),

OPEN LICENSING PROGRAMS ALLOW CUSTOMERS TO ACQUIRE PERPETUAL OR SUBSCRIPTION LICENSES AND, AT THE CUSTOMERS ELECTION, RIGHTS TO FUTURE VERSIONS OF SOFTWARE PRODUCTS OVER A SPECIFIED TIME PERIOD (TWO OR THREE YEARS DEPENDING ON THE OPEN PROGRAM

USED). THE OFFERING THAT CONVEYS RIGHTS TO FUTURE VERSIONS OF CERTAIN SOFTWARE PRODUCTS OVER THE CONTRACT PERIOD IS CALLED SOFTWARE ASSURANCE. SOFTWARE ASSURANCE ALSO PROVIDES SUPPORT, TOOLS, AND TRAINING TO HELP CUSTOMERS DEPLOY AND USE SOFTWARE

EFFICIENTLY. UNDER THE OPEN PROGRAM, CUSTOMERS CAN ACQUIRE LICENSES ONLY, OR LICENSES WITH SOFTWARE ASSURANCE. THEY CAN ALSO RENEW SOFTWARE ASSURANCE UPON THE EXPIRATION OF EXISTING VOLUME LICENSING AGREEMENTS.

SELECT LICENSING

DESIGNED PRIMARILY FOR MEDIUM-TO-LARGE ORGANIZATIONS (GREATER THAN 250 LICENSES), THE SELECT PROGRAM ALLOWS CUSTOMERS TO ACQUIRE PERPETUAL LICENSES AND, AT THE CUSTOMERS ELECTION, SOFTWARE ASSURANCE OVER A

SPECIFIED TIME PERIOD (GENERALLY THREE YEARS OR LESS). SIMILAR TO THE OPEN PROGRAM, THE SELECT PROGRAM ALLOWS CUSTOMERS TO ACQUIRE LICENSES ONLY, ACQUIRE LICENSES WITH SOFTWARE ASSURANCE, OR RENEW SOFTWARE ASSURANCE UPON THE EXPIRATION OF EXISTING

VOLUME LICENSING AGREEMENTS. ONLINE SERVICES ARE ALSO AVAILABLE FOR PURCHASE THROUGH THE SELECT PROGRAM, AND SUBSCRIPTIONS ARE GENERALLY STRUCTURED WITH TERMS BETWEEN ONE AND THREE YEARS.

SERVICES PROVIDER LICENSING

THE MICROSOFT SERVICES PROVIDER LICENSE AGREEMENT

(SPLA) IS A PROGRAM TARGETED TO SERVICE PROVIDERS AND INDEPENDENT SOFTWARE VENDORS (ISVS) ALLOWING THESE PARTNERS TO PROVIDE SOFTWARE SERVICES AND HOSTED APPLICATIONS TO THEIR END CUSTOMERS. AGREEMENTS ARE GENERALLY

STRUCTURED WITH A THREE-YEAR TERM, AND PARTNERS ARE BILLED MONTHLY BASED UPON CONSUMPTION.

ENTERPRISE AGREEMENT LICENSING

ENTERPRISE AGREEMENTS ARE TARGETED AT MEDIUM AND LARGE ORGANIZATIONS (GREATER THAN 250 LICENSES) THAT WANT TO ACQUIRE LICENSES TO SOFTWARE

PRODUCTS, ALONG WITH SOFTWARE ASSURANCE, FOR ALL OR SUBSTANTIAL PARTS OF THEIR ENTERPRISE. ENTERPRISES CAN ELECT TO EITHER ACQUIRE PERPETUAL LICENSES OR, UNDER THE ENTERPRISE SUBSCRIPTION PROGRAM, CAN ACQUIRE NON-PERPETUAL, SUBSCRIPTION AGREEMENTS

FOR A SPECIFIED TIME PERIOD (GENERALLY THREE YEARS). ONLINE SERVICES ARE ALSO AVAILABLE FOR PURCHASE THROUGH THE ENTERPRISE AGREEMENT AND SUBSCRIPTIONS ARE GENERALLY STRUCTURED WITH THREE YEAR TERMS.

CUSTOMERS

OUR CUSTOMERS

INCLUDE INDIVIDUAL CONSUMERS, SMALL- AND MEDIUM-SIZED ORGANIZATIONS, ENTERPRISES, GOVERNMENTAL INSTITUTIONS, EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS, INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDERS, APPLICATION DEVELOPERS, AND OEMS. CONSUMERS AND SMALL- AND MEDIUM-SIZED ORGANIZATIONS

OBTAIN OUR PRODUCTS PRIMARILY THROUGH DISTRIBUTORS, RESELLERS, AND OEMS. NO SALES TO AN INDIVIDUAL CUSTOMER ACCOUNTED FOR MORE THAN 10% OF FISCAL YEAR 2011, 2010, OR 2009 REVENUE. OUR PRACTICE IS TO SHIP OUR PRODUCTS PROMPTLY UPON RECEIPT OF

PURCHASE ORDERS FROM CUSTOMERS; CONSEQUENTLY, BACKLOG IS NOT SIGNIFICANT.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS

OUR OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL RESULTS ARE SUBJECT TO VARIOUS RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES, INCLUDING THOSE DESCRIBED BELOW, THAT COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, CASH

FLOWS, AND THE TRADING PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK.

THE CLOUD-BASED COMPUTING MODEL PRESENTS EXECUTION AND COMPETITIVE

RISKS.

WE ARE TRANSITIONING OUR STRATEGY TO A COMPUTING ENVIRONMENT CHARACTERIZED BY CLOUD-BASED SERVICES USED WITH SMART CLIENT DEVICES. OUR COMPETITORS ARE RAPIDLY DEVELOPING AND DEPLOYING CLOUD-BASED SERVICES FOR

CONSUMERS AND BUSINESS CUSTOMERS. PRICING AND DELIVERY MODELS ARE EVOLVING. DEVICES AND FORM FACTORS INFLUENCE HOW USERS ACCESS SERVICES IN THE CLOUD. WE ARE DEVOTING SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES TO DEVELOP AND DEPLOY OUR OWN COMPETING CLOUD-BASED SOFTWARE

PLUS SERVICES STRATEGIES. WHILE WE BELIEVE OUR EXPERTISE, INVESTMENTS IN INFRASTRUCTURE, AND THE BREADTH OF OUR CLOUD-BASED SERVICES PROVIDES US WITH A STRONG FOUNDATION TO COMPETE, IT IS UNCERTAIN WHETHER OUR STRATEGIES WILL ATTRACT THE USERS OR

GENERATE THE REVENUE REQUIRED TO BE SUCCESSFUL. IN ADDITION TO SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT COSTS, WE ARE INCURRING COSTS TO BUILD AND MAINTAIN INFRASTRUCTURE TO SUPPORT CLOUD COMPUTING SERVICES. THESE COSTS MAY REDUCE THE OPERATING MARGINS WE HAVE

PREVIOUSLY ACHIEVED. WHETHER WE ARE SUCCESSFUL IN THIS NEW BUSINESS MODEL DEPENDS ON OUR EXECUTION IN A NUMBER OF AREAS, INCLUDING.



CONTINUING TO INNOVATE AND BRING TO MARKET COMPELLING CLOUD-BASED EXPERIENCES THAT GENERATE INCREASING TRAFFIC AND MARKET SHARE;



MAINTAINING THE UTILITY, COMPATIBILITY, AND PERFORMANCE OF OUR CLOUD-BASED SERVICES ON THE GROWING ARRAY OF COMPUTING DEVICES, INCLUDING SMARTPHONES, HANDHELD

COMPUTERS, NETBOOKS, TABLETS, AND TELEVISION SET TOP DEVICES;



CONTINUING TO ENHANCE THE ATTRACTIVENESS OF OUR CLOUD PLATFORMS TO THIRD-PARTY DEVELOPERS; AND



ENSURING THAT OUR CLOUD SERVICES MEET THE RELIABILITY EXPECTATIONS OF OUR CUSTOMERS AND MAINTAIN THE SECURITY OF THEIR DATA.

ITEM 1A

CHALLENGES TO OUR BUSINESS MODELS MAY REDUCE OUR REVENUE OR OPERATING

MARGINS.

WHETHER OUR SOFTWARE RUNS IN THE CLOUD OR ON A DEVICE, WE CONTINUE TO FACE CHALLENGES FROM ALTERNATIVE MEANS OF DEVELOPING AND LICENSING SOFTWARE. UNDER OUR LICENSE-BASED SOFTWARE MODEL, SOFTWARE DEVELOPERS BEAR

THE COSTS OF CONVERTING ORIGINAL IDEAS INTO SOFTWARE PRODUCTS THROUGH INVESTMENTS IN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, OFFSETTING THESE COSTS WITH THE REVENUE RECEIVED FROM THE DISTRIBUTION OF THEIR PRODUCTS. CERTAIN OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE

BUSINESS MODELS CHALLENGE OUR LICENSE-BASED SOFTWARE MODEL. OPEN SOURCE COMMONLY REFERS TO SOFTWARE WHOSE SOURCE CODE IS SUBJECT TO A LICENSE ALLOWING IT TO BE MODIFIED, COMBINED WITH OTHER SOFTWARE AND REDISTRIBUTED, SUBJECT TO RESTRICTIONS SET

FORTH IN THE LICENSE. SOME COMPANIES COMPETE WITH US USING AN OPEN SOURCE BUSINESS MODEL BY MODIFYING AND THEN DISTRIBUTING OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE TO END USERS AT NOMINAL COST AND EARNING REVENUE ON COMPLEMENTARY SERVICES AND PRODUCTS. THESE FIRMS DO

NOT BEAR THE FULL COSTS OF RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT FOR THE SOFTWARE. IN SOME CASES, THEIR PRODUCTS MAY INFRINGE OUR PATENTS. IN ADDITION, ADVERTISING-BASED BUSINESS MODELS SEEK REVENUE BY DELIVERING THIRD PARTY ADVERTISEMENTS TO END CUSTOMERS WHO

RECEIVE THE SOFTWARE AND SERVICES AT NO DIRECT COSTS. GAINS IN MARKET ACCEPTANCE OF OPEN SOURCE OR ADVERTISING BASED SOFTWARE MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR SALES, REVENUE, AND OPERATING MARGINS.

AN IMPORTANT ELEMENT OF OUR BUSINESS MODEL HAS BEEN TO CREATE PLATFORM-BASED ECOSYSTEMS ON WHICH MANY PARTICIPANTS CAN BUILD DIVERSE SOLUTIONS. A

COMPETING VERTICALLY-INTEGRATED MODEL, IN WHICH A SINGLE FIRM CONTROLS BOTH THE SOFTWARE AND HARDWARE ELEMENTS OF A PRODUCT, HAS BEEN SUCCESSFUL WITH CERTAIN CONSUMER PRODUCTS SUCH AS PERSONAL COMPUTERS, MOBILE PHONES, AND DIGITAL MUSIC PLAYERS. WE

ALSO OFFER VERTICALLY-INTEGRATED HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE PRODUCTS; HOWEVER, EFFORTS TO COMPETE WITH THE VERTICALLY INTEGRATED MODEL MAY INCREASE OUR COST OF SALES AND REDUCE OUR OPERATING MARGINS.

WE DERIVE SUBSTANTIAL REVENUE FROM LICENSES OF WINDOWS OPERATING SYSTEMS ON PERSONAL COMPUTERS. THE PROLIFERATION OF ALTERNATIVE DEVICES AND FORM

FACTORS CREATES CHALLENGES FROM COMPETING SOFTWARE PLATFORMS. IT IS UNCERTAIN TO WHAT EXTENT ALTERNATIVE DEVICES WILL INCREASE THE NUMBER OF COMPUTING DEVICES THAT USERS OWN, OR WILL SUBSTITUTE FOR USERS PERSONAL COMPUTER PURCHASES.

ALTERNATIVE DEVICES ALSO RUN OPERATING SYSTEMS AND APPLICATIONS DEVELOPED BY OUR COMPETITORS. THESE FACTORS COULD IMPACT OUR REVENUE AND MARGINS.

WE FACE INTENSE COMPETITION.

WE CONTINUE TO EXPERIENCE INTENSE COMPETITION ACROSS ALL MARKETS FOR OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. OUR COMPETITORS RANGE IN SIZE FROM FORTUNE 100 COMPANIES TO

SMALL, SPECIALIZED SINGLE-PRODUCT BUSINESSES AND OPEN SOURCE COMMUNITY-BASED PROJECTS. ALTHOUGH WE BELIEVE THE BREADTH OF OUR BUSINESSES AND PRODUCT PORTFOLIO IS A COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE, OUR COMPETITORS THAT ARE FOCUSED ON NARROWER PRODUCT LINES MAY

BE MORE EFFECTIVE IN DEVOTING TECHNICAL, MARKETING, AND FINANCIAL RESOURCES TO COMPETE WITH US. IN ADDITION, BARRIERS TO ENTRY IN OUR BUSINESSES GENERALLY ARE LOW AND PRODUCTS, ONCE DEVELOPED, CAN BE DISTRIBUTED BROADLY AND QUICKLY AT RELATIVELY LOW

COST. OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE VENDORS ARE DEVOTING CONSIDERABLE EFFORTS TO DEVELOPING SOFTWARE THAT MIMICS THE FEATURES AND FUNCTIONALITY OF OUR PRODUCTS, IN SOME CASES IN VIOLATION OF OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS OR ON THE BASIS OF TECHNICAL

SPECIFICATIONS FOR MICROSOFT TECHNOLOGIES THAT WE MAKE AVAILABLE AT LITTLE OR NO COST IN CONNECTION WITH OUR INTEROPERABILITY INITIATIVES. IN RESPONSE TO COMPETITION, WE CONTINUE TO DEVELOP VERSIONS OF OUR PRODUCTS WITH BASIC FUNCTIONALITY THAT ARE

SOLD AT LOWER PRICES THAN THE STANDARD VERSIONS. THESE COMPETITIVE PRESSURES MAY RESULT IN DECREASED SALES VOLUMES, PRICE REDUCTIONS, AND/OR INCREASED OPERATING COSTS, SUCH AS FOR MARKETING AND SALES INCENTIVES, RESULTING IN LOWER REVENUE, GROSS

MARGINS, AND OPERATING INCOME.

WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO ADEQUATELY PROTECT OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

RIGHTS.

PROTECTING OUR GLOBAL INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS AND COMBATING UNLICENSED COPYING AND USE OF SOFTWARE AND OTHER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY IS DIFFICULT. WHILE PIRACY ADVERSELY AFFECTS U.S. REVENUE, THE IMPACT ON

REVENUE FROM OUTSIDE THE U.S. IS MORE SIGNIFICANT, PARTICULARLY IN COUNTRIES WHERE LAWS ARE LESS PROTECTIVE OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS. AS A RESULT, OUR REVENUE IN THESE MARKETS LIKELY WILL GROW SLOWER THAN THE UNDERLYING PC MARKET. SIMILARLY,

THE ABSENCE OF HARMONIZED PATENT LAWS MAKES IT MORE DIFFICULT TO ENSURE CONSISTENT RESPECT FOR PATENT RIGHTS. THROUGHOUT THE WORLD, WE ACTIVELY EDUCATE CONSUMERS ABOUT THE BENEFITS OF LICENSING GENUINE PRODUCTS AND OBTAINING INDEMNIFICATION BENEFITS

FOR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RISKS, AND WE EDUCATE LAWMAKERS ABOUT THE ADVANTAGES OF A BUSINESS CLIMATE WHERE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS ARE PROTECTED. HOWEVER, CONTINUED EDUCATIONAL AND ENFORCEMENT EFFORTS MAY FAIL TO ENHANCE REVENUE. REDUCTIONS IN

THE LEGAL PROTECTION FOR SOFTWARE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT REVENUE.

THIRD PARTIES MAY CLAIM WE INFRINGE

THEIR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS.

FROM TIME TO TIME, WE RECEIVE NOTICES FROM OTHERS CLAIMING WE INFRINGE THEIR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS. BECAUSE OF CONSTANT TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE IN THE

15

TABLE OF CONTENTS

PART I

ITEM 1A

SEGMENTS IN WHICH WE COMPETE, THE EXTENSIVE PATENT COVERAGE OF EXISTING TECHNOLOGIES, AND THE RAPID RATE OF ISSUANCE OF NEW PATENTS, IT IS POSSIBLE THE NUMBER OF THESE CLAIMS MAY GROW. TO RESOLVE

THESE CLAIMS WE MAY ENTER INTO ROYALTY AND LICENSING AGREEMENTS ON LESS FAVORABLE TERMS, STOP SELLING OR REDESIGN AFFECTED PRODUCTS, OR PAY DAMAGES TO SATISFY INDEMNIFICATION COMMITMENTS WITH OUR CUSTOMERS. SUCH AGREEMENTS MAY CAUSE OPERATING

MARGINS TO DECLINE. WE HAVE MADE AND EXPECT TO CONTINUE MAKING SIGNIFICANT EXPENDITURES TO SETTLE CLAIMS RELATED TO THE USE OF TECHNOLOGY AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS AS PART OF OUR STRATEGY TO MANAGE THIS RISK.

WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO PROTECT OUR SOURCE CODE FROM COPYING IF THERE IS AN UNAUTHORIZED DISCLOSURE OF SOURCE

CODE.

SOURCE CODE, THE DETAILED PROGRAM COMMANDS FOR OUR OPERATING SYSTEMS AND OTHER SOFTWARE PROGRAMS, IS CRITICAL TO OUR BUSINESS. ALTHOUGH WE LICENSE PORTIONS OF OUR APPLICATION AND OPERATING SYSTEM SOURCE CODE TO A

NUMBER OF LICENSEES, WE TAKE SIGNIFICANT MEASURES TO PROTECT THE SECRECY OF LARGE PORTIONS OF OUR SOURCE CODE. IF AN UNAUTHORIZED DISCLOSURE OF A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR SOURCE CODE OCCURS, WE COULD POTENTIALLY LOSE FUTURE TRADE SECRET PROTECTION

FOR THAT SOURCE CODE. THIS COULD MAKE IT EASIER FOR THIRD PARTIES TO COMPETE WITH OUR PRODUCTS BY COPYING FUNCTIONALITY, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR REVENUE AND OPERATING MARGINS. UNAUTHORIZED DISCLOSURE OF SOURCE CODE ALSO COULD INCREASE THE

SECURITY RISKS DESCRIBED IN THE NEXT PARAGRAPH.

SECURITY VULNERABILITIES COULD LEAD TO REDUCED REVENUE, LIABILITY CLAIMS, OR

COMPETITIVE HARM.

MAINTAINING THE SECURITY OF COMPUTERS AND COMPUTER NETWORKS IS PARAMOUNT FOR US AND OUR CUSTOMERS. HACKERS DEVELOP AND DEPLOY VIRUSES, WORMS, AND OTHER MALICIOUS SOFTWARE PROGRAMS THAT ATTACK OUR PRODUCTS

AND SERVICES AND GAIN ACCESS TO OUR NETWORKS AND DATA CENTERS. ALTHOUGH THIS IS AN INDUSTRY-WIDE PROBLEM THAT AFFECTS COMPUTERS ACROSS ALL PLATFORMS, IT AFFECTS OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES IN PARTICULAR BECAUSE HACKERS TEND TO FOCUS THEIR EFFORTS ON

THE MOST POPULAR OPERATING SYSTEMS, PROGRAMS, AND SERVICES, AND WE EXPECT THEM TO CONTINUE TO DO SO. GROUPS OF HACKERS MAY ALSO ACT IN A COORDINATED MANNER TO LAUNCH DISTRIBUTED DENIAL OF SERVICE ATTACKS, OR OTHER COORDINATED ATTACKS, THAT MAY CAUSE

SERVICE OUTAGES OR OTHER INTERRUPTIONS. WE DEVOTE SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES TO ADDRESS SECURITY VULNERABILITIES THROUGH.



ENGINEERING MORE SECURE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES;



ENHANCING SECURITY AND RELIABILITY FEATURES IN OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, AND CONTINUOUSLY EVALUATING AND UPDATING THOSE SECURITY AND RELIABILITY FEATURES;



HELPING OUR CUSTOMERS MAKE THE BEST USE OF OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES TO PROTECT AGAINST COMPUTER VIRUSES AND OTHER ATTACKS;



IMPROVING THE DEPLOYMENT OF SOFTWARE UPDATES TO ADDRESS SECURITY VULNERABILITIES;



INVESTING IN MITIGATION TECHNOLOGIES THAT HELP TO SECURE CUSTOMERS FROM ATTACKS EVEN WHEN SUCH SOFTWARE UPDATES ARE NOT DEPLOYED; AND



PROVIDING CUSTOMERS ONLINE AUTOMATED SECURITY TOOLS, PUBLISHED SECURITY GUIDANCE, AND SECURITY SOFTWARE SUCH AS FIREWALLS AND ANTI-VIRUS SOFTWARE.

THE COST OF THESE STEPS COULD REDUCE OUR OPERATING MARGINS. DESPITE THESE EFFORTS, ACTUAL OR PERCEIVED SECURITY

VULNERABILITIES IN OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES COULD CAUSE SIGNIFICANT REPUTATIONAL HARM AND LEAD SOME CUSTOMERS TO SEEK TO RETURN PRODUCTS, TO REDUCE OR DELAY FUTURE PURCHASES OR ADOPTION OF SERVICES, OR TO USE COMPETING PRODUCTS. CUSTOMERS MAY ALSO

INCREASE THEIR EXPENDITURES ON PROTECTING THEIR EXISTING COMPUTER SYSTEMS FROM ATTACK, WHICH COULD DELAY ADOPTION OF NEW TECHNOLOGIES. ANY OF THESE ACTIONS BY CUSTOMERS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR REVENUE. ACTUAL OR PERCEIVED VULNERABILITIES MAY LEAD

TO CLAIMS AGAINST US. ALTHOUGH OUR LICENSE AGREEMENTS TYPICALLY CONTAIN PROVISIONS THAT ELIMINATE OR LIMIT OUR EXPOSURE TO SUCH LIABILITY, THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THESE PROVISIONS WILL WITHSTAND ALL LEGAL CHALLENGES.

IN ADDITION, OUR INTERNAL INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY ENVIRONMENT CONTINUES TO EVOLVE. WE ARE OFTEN EARLY ADOPTERS OF NEW DEVICES AND TECHNOLOGIES. WE

EMBRACE NEW WAYS OF SHARING DATA AND COMMUNICATING WITH PARTNERS AND CUSTOMERS USING METHODS SUCH AS SOCIAL NETWORKING. THESE PRACTICES CAN ENHANCE EFFICIENCY AND BUSINESS INSIGHT, BUT THEY ALSO PRESENT RISKS THAT OUR BUSINESS POLICIES AND INTERNAL

SECURITY CONTROLS MAY NOT KEEP PACE WITH THE SPEED OF THESE CHANGES. IF THIRD PARTIES GAIN ACCESS TO OUR NETWORKS OR DATA CENTERS, THEY COULD OBTAIN AND EXPLOIT CONFIDENTIAL BUSINESS INFORMATION AND HARM OUR COMPETITIVE POSITION.

ITEM 1A

IMPROPER DISCLOSURE OF PERSONAL DATA COULD RESULT IN LIABILITY AND HARM OUR

REPUTATION.

AS WE CONTINUE TO EXECUTE OUR STRATEGY OF INCREASING THE NUMBER AND SCALE OF OUR CLOUD-BASED OFFERINGS, WE STORE AND PROCESS INCREASINGLY LARGE AMOUNTS OF PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION OF OUR CUSTOMERS.

AT THE SAME TIME, THE CONTINUED OCCURRENCE OF HIGH-PROFILE DATA BREACHES PROVIDES EVIDENCE OF AN EXTERNAL ENVIRONMENT INCREASINGLY HOSTILE TO INFORMATION SECURITY. THIS ENVIRONMENT DEMANDS THAT WE CONTINUOUSLY IMPROVE OUR DESIGN AND COORDINATION OF

SECURITY CONTROLS ACROSS OUR BUSINESS GROUPS AND GEOGRAPHIES. DESPITE THESE EFFORTS, IT IS POSSIBLE OUR SECURITY CONTROLS OVER PERSONAL DATA, OUR TRAINING OF EMPLOYEES AND VENDORS ON DATA SECURITY, AND OTHER PRACTICES WE FOLLOW MAY NOT PREVENT THE

IMPROPER DISCLOSURE OF PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION. IMPROPER DISCLOSURE OF THIS INFORMATION COULD HARM OUR REPUTATION, LEAD TO LEGAL EXPOSURE TO CUSTOMERS, OR SUBJECT US TO LIABILITY UNDER LAWS THAT PROTECT PERSONAL DATA, RESULTING IN

INCREASED COSTS OR LOSS OF REVENUE. OUR SOFTWARE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES ALSO ENABLE OUR CUSTOMERS TO STORE AND PROCESS PERSONAL DATA ON PREMISES OR, INCREASINGLY, IN A CLOUD-BASED ENVIRONMENT WE HOST. WE BELIEVE CONSUMERS USING OUR EMAIL, MESSAGING,

STORAGE, SHARING, AND SOCIAL NETWORKING SERVICES WILL INCREASINGLY WANT EFFICIENT, CENTRALIZED METHODS OF CHOOSING THEIR PRIVACY PREFERENCES AND CONTROLLING THEIR DATA. PERCEPTIONS THAT OUR PRODUCTS OR SERVICES DO NOT ADEQUATELY PROTECT THE PRIVACY

OF PERSONAL INFORMATION COULD INHIBIT SALES OF OUR PRODUCTS OR SERVICES, AND COULD CONSTRAIN CONSUMER AND BUSINESS ADOPTION OF CLOUD-BASED SOLUTIONS.

WE MAY EXPERIENCE OUTAGES, DATA LOSS AND DISRUPTIONS OF OUR ONLINE SERVICES IF WE FAIL TO MAINTAIN AN ADEQUATE OPERATIONS INFRASTRUCTURE.

OUR INCREASING USER TRAFFIC AND COMPLEXITY OF

OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES DEMAND MORE COMPUTING POWER. WE HAVE SPENT AND EXPECT TO CONTINUE TO SPEND SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNTS TO PURCHASE OR LEASE DATA CENTERS AND EQUIPMENT AND TO UPGRADE OUR TECHNOLOGY AND NETWORK INFRASTRUCTURE TO HANDLE INCREASED

TRAFFIC ON OUR WEB SITES AND IN OUR DATA CENTERS, AND TO INTRODUCE NEW PRODUCTS AND SERVICES AND SUPPORT EXISTING SERVICES SUCH AS BING, EXCHANGE ONLINE, OFFICE 365, SHAREPOINT ONLINE, XBOX LIVE, WINDOWS AZURE, WINDOWS LIVE, AND MICROSOFT OFFICE WEB

APPS. WE ALSO ARE GROWING OUR BUSINESS OF PROVIDING A PLATFORM AND BACK-END HOSTING FOR SERVICES PROVIDED BY THIRD-PARTY BUSINESSES TO THEIR END CUSTOMERS. MAINTAINING AND EXPANDING THIS INFRASTRUCTURE IS EXPENSIVE AND COMPLEX. INEFFICIENCIES OR

OPERATIONAL FAILURES, INCLUDING TEMPORARY OR PERMANENT LOSS OF CUSTOMER DATA, COULD DIMINISH THE QUALITY OF OUR PRODUCTS, SERVICES, AND USER EXPERIENCE RESULTING IN CONTRACTUAL LIABILITY, CLAIMS BY CUSTOMERS AND OTHER THIRD PARTIES, DAMAGE TO OUR

REPUTATION AND LOSS OF CURRENT AND POTENTIAL USERS, SUBSCRIBERS, AND ADVERTISERS, EACH OF WHICH MAY HARM OUR OPERATING RESULTS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

WE ARE SUBJECT TO GOVERNMENT LITIGATION AND REGULATORY ACTIVITY THAT AFFECTS HOW WE DESIGN AND MARKET OUR PRODUCTS.

AS A LEADING GLOBAL SOFTWARE MAKER, WE RECEIVE CLOSE SCRUTINY FROM

GOVERNMENT AGENCIES UNDER U.S. AND FOREIGN COMPETITION LAWS. SOME JURISDICTIONS ALSO PROVIDE PRIVATE RIGHTS OF ACTION FOR COMPETITORS OR CONSUMERS TO ASSERT CLAIMS OF ANTI-COMPETITIVE CONDUCT. FOR EXAMPLE, WE HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN THE FOLLOWING

ACTIONS.

LAWSUITS BROUGHT BY THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE, 18 STATES, AND THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA IN TWO SEPARATE ACTIONS WERE

RESOLVED THROUGH A CONSENT DECREE THAT TOOK EFFECT IN 2001 AND A FINAL JUDGMENT ENTERED IN 2002. THESE PROCEEDINGS IMPOSED VARIOUS CONSTRAINTS ON OUR WINDOWS OPERATING SYSTEM BUSINESSES. THESE CONSTRAINTS INCLUDED LIMITS ON CERTAIN CONTRACTING

PRACTICES, MANDATED DISCLOSURE OF CERTAIN SOFTWARE PROGRAM INTERFACES AND PROTOCOLS, AND RIGHTS FOR COMPUTER MANUFACTURERS TO LIMIT THE VISIBILITY OF CERTAIN WINDOWS FEATURES IN NEW PCS. ALTHOUGH THE CONSENT DECREE AND FINAL JUDGMENT EXPIRED IN MAY

2011, WE EXPECT THAT FEDERAL AND STATE ANTITRUST AUTHORITIES WILL CONTINUE TO CLOSELY SCRUTINIZE OUR BUSINESS.

THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION

CLOSELY SCRUTINIZES THE DESIGN OF HIGH-VOLUME MICROSOFT PRODUCTS AND THE TERMS ON WHICH WE MAKE CERTAIN TECHNOLOGIES USED IN THESE PRODUCTS, SUCH AS FILE FORMATS, PROGRAMMING INTERFACES, AND PROTOCOLS, AVAILABLE TO OTHER COMPANIES. IN 2004, THE

COMMISSION ORDERED US TO CREATE NEW VERSIONS OF WINDOWS THAT DO NOT INCLUDE CERTAIN MULTIMEDIA TECHNOLOGIES AND TO PROVIDE OUR COMPETITORS WITH SPECIFICATIONS FOR HOW TO IMPLEMENT CERTAIN PROPRIETARY WINDOWS COMMUNICATIONS PROTOCOLS IN THEIR OWN

PRODUCTS. IN 2009, THE COMMISSION ACCEPTED A SET OF COMMITMENTS OFFERED BY MICROSOFT TO ADDRESS THE COMMISSIONS CONCERNS RELATING TO COMPETITION IN WEB BROWSING SOFTWARE. THE COMMISSIONS IMPACT ON PRODUCT DESIGN MAY LIMIT OUR ABILITY TO

INNOVATE IN WINDOWS OR OTHER PRODUCTS IN THE FUTURE, DIMINISH THE DEVELOPER APPEAL OF THE WINDOWS PLATFORM, AND INCREASE OUR PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT COSTS. THE AVAILABILITY OF LICENSES RELATED TO PROTOCOLS AND FILE FORMATS MAY ENABLE COMPETITORS TO

DEVELOP SOFTWARE PRODUCTS THAT BETTER MIMIC THE FUNCTIONALITY OF OUR OWN PRODUCTS WHICH COULD RESULT IN DECREASED SALES OF OUR PRODUCTS.

ITEM 1A

GOVERNMENT REGULATORY ACTIONS AND COURT DECISIONS SUCH AS THESE MAY HINDER OUR ABILITY TO PROVIDE

THE BENEFITS OF OUR SOFTWARE TO CONSUMERS AND BUSINESSES, THEREBY REDUCING THE ATTRACTIVENESS OF OUR PRODUCTS AND THE REVENUE THAT COME FROM THEM. NEW ACTIONS COULD BE INITIATED AT ANY TIME, EITHER BY THESE OR OTHER GOVERNMENTS OR PRIVATE CLAIMANTS,

INCLUDING WITH RESPECT TO NEW VERSIONS OF WINDOWS OR OTHER MICROSOFT PRODUCTS. THE OUTCOME OF SUCH ACTIONS, OR STEPS TAKEN TO AVOID THEM, COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT US IN A VARIETY OF WAYS, INCLUDING.



WE MAY HAVE TO CHOOSE BETWEEN WITHDRAWING PRODUCTS FROM CERTAIN GEOGRAPHIES TO AVOID FINES OR DESIGNING AND DEVELOPING ALTERNATIVE VERSIONS OF THOSE PRODUCTS

TO COMPLY WITH GOVERNMENT RULINGS, WHICH MAY ENTAIL A DELAY IN A PRODUCT RELEASE AND REMOVING FUNCTIONALITY THAT CUSTOMERS WANT OR ON WHICH DEVELOPERS RELY.



WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO MAKE AVAILABLE LICENSES TO OUR PROPRIETARY TECHNOLOGIES ON TERMS THAT DO NOT REFLECT THEIR FAIR MARKET VALUE OR DO NOT PROTECT OUR

ASSOCIATED INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY.



THE RULINGS DESCRIBED ABOVE MAY BE USED AS PRECEDENT IN OTHER COMPETITION LAW PROCEEDINGS.

OUR SOFTWARE AND SERVICES ONLINE OFFERINGS ARE SUBJECT TO GOVERNMENT REGULATION OF THE INTERNET DOMESTICALLY AND INTERNATIONALLY IN MANY AREAS,

INCLUDING USER PRIVACY, TELECOMMUNICATIONS, DATA PROTECTION, AND ONLINE CONTENT. THE APPLICATION OF THESE LAWS AND REGULATIONS TO OUR BUSINESS IS OFTEN UNCLEAR AND SOMETIMES MAY CONFLICT. COMPLIANCE WITH THESE REGULATIONS MAY INVOLVE SIGNIFICANT

COSTS OR REQUIRE CHANGES IN BUSINESS PRACTICES THAT RESULT IN REDUCED REVENUE. NONCOMPLIANCE COULD RESULT IN PENALTIES BEING IMPOSED ON US OR ORDERS THAT WE STOP THE ALLEGED NONCOMPLIANT ACTIVITY.

OUR BUSINESS DEPENDS ON OUR ABILITY TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN TALENTED EMPLOYEES.

OUR BUSINESS IS BASED ON SUCCESSFULLY

ATTRACTING AND RETAINING TALENTED EMPLOYEES. THE MARKET FOR HIGHLY SKILLED WORKERS AND LEADERS IN OUR INDUSTRY IS EXTREMELY COMPETITIVE. WE ARE LIMITED IN OUR ABILITY TO RECRUIT INTERNATIONALLY BY RESTRICTIVE DOMESTIC IMMIGRATION LAWS. IF WE ARE

LESS SUCCESSFUL IN OUR RECRUITING EFFORTS, OR IF WE ARE UNABLE TO RETAIN KEY EMPLOYEES, OUR ABILITY TO DEVELOP AND DELIVER SUCCESSFUL PRODUCTS AND SERVICES MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED. EFFECTIVE SUCCESSION PLANNING IS ALSO IMPORTANT TO OUR LONG-TERM

SUCCESS. FAILURE TO ENSURE EFFECTIVE TRANSFER OF KNOWLEDGE AND SMOOTH TRANSITIONS INVOLVING KEY EMPLOYEES COULD HINDER OUR STRATEGIC PLANNING AND EXECUTION.

DELAYS IN PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT SCHEDULES MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR REVENUE.

THE DEVELOPMENT OF SOFTWARE PRODUCTS IS A COMPLEX AND TIME-CONSUMING PROCESS. NEW PRODUCTS AND ENHANCEMENTS TO

EXISTING PRODUCTS CAN REQUIRE LONG DEVELOPMENT AND TESTING PERIODS. OUR INCREASING FOCUS ON CLOUD-BASED SOFTWARE PLUS SERVICES ALSO PRESENTS NEW AND COMPLEX DEVELOPMENT ISSUES. SIGNIFICANT DELAYS IN NEW PRODUCT OR SERVICE RELEASES OR SIGNIFICANT

PROBLEMS IN CREATING NEW PRODUCTS OR SERVICES COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR REVENUE.

WE MAKE SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS IN NEW PRODUCTS

AND SERVICES THAT MAY NOT BE PROFITABLE.

OUR GROWTH DEPENDS ON OUR ABILITY TO INNOVATE BY OFFERING NEW, AND ADDING VALUE TO OUR EXISTING, SOFTWARE AND SERVICE OFFERINGS. WE WILL CONTINUE TO MAKE SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS IN

RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT, AND MARKETING FOR NEW PRODUCTS, SERVICES, AND TECHNOLOGIES, INCLUDING THE WINDOWS PC OPERATING SYSTEM, THE MICROSOFT OFFICE SYSTEM, BING, WINDOWS PHONE, WINDOWS SERVER, WINDOWS LIVE, THE WINDOWS AZURE SERVICES PLATFORM AND

OTHER CLOUD-BASED SERVICES OFFERINGS, AND THE XBOX 360 ENTERTAINMENT PLATFORM. INVESTMENTS IN NEW TECHNOLOGY ARE SPECULATIVE. COMMERCIAL SUCCESS DEPENDS ON MANY FACTORS, INCLUDING INNOVATIVENESS, DEVELOPER SUPPORT, AND EFFECTIVE DISTRIBUTION AND

MARKETING. OUR DEGREE OF SUCCESS WITH WINDOWS PHONE, FOR EXAMPLE, WILL IMPACT OUR ABILITY TO GROW OUR SHARE OF THE SMARTPHONE OPERATING SYSTEM MARKET. IT WILL ALSO BE AN IMPORTANT FACTOR IN SUPPORTING OUR STRATEGY OF DELIVERING VALUE TO END USERS

SEAMLESSLY OVER PC, PHONE, AND TV DEVICE CLASSES. IF CUSTOMERS DO NOT PERCEIVE OUR LATEST OFFERINGS AS PROVIDING SIGNIFICANT NEW FUNCTIONALITY OR OTHER VALUE, THEY MAY REDUCE THEIR PURCHASES OF NEW SOFTWARE PRODUCTS OR UPGRADES, UNFAVORABLY

IMPACTING REVENUE. WE MAY NOT ACHIEVE SIGNIFICANT REVENUE FROM NEW PRODUCT AND SERVICE INVESTMENTS FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS, IF AT ALL. MOREOVER, NEW PRODUCTS AND SERVICES MAY NOT BE PROFITABLE, AND EVEN IF THEY ARE PROFITABLE, OPERATING MARGINS FOR

NEW PRODUCTS AND BUSINESSES MAY NOT BE AS HIGH AS THE MARGINS WE HAVE EXPERIENCED HISTORICALLY.

ADVERSE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS MAY HARM

OUR BUSINESS.

UNFAVORABLE CHANGES IN ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, INCLUDING INFLATION, RECESSION, OR OTHER CHANGES IN ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, MAY RESULT IN LOWER INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SPENDING AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR REVENUE. IF

DEMAND FOR PCS, SERVERS, AND OTHER COMPUTING DEVICES DECLINES, OR CONSUMER OR

18

TABLE OF CONTENTS

PART I

ITEM 1A

BUSINESS SPENDING FOR THOSE PRODUCTS DECLINES, OUR REVENUE WILL BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED. OUR PRODUCT DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM ALSO RELIES ON AN EXTENSIVE PARTNER NETWORK. THE IMPACT OF ECONOMIC

CONDITIONS ON OUR PARTNERS, SUCH AS THE BANKRUPTCY OF A MAJOR DISTRIBUTOR, COULD RESULT IN SALES CHANNEL DISRUPTION. CHALLENGING ECONOMIC CONDITIONS ALSO MAY IMPAIR THE ABILITY OF OUR CUSTOMERS TO PAY FOR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES THEY HAVE PURCHASED.

AS A RESULT, RESERVES FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS AND WRITE-OFFS OF ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE MAY INCREASE. WE MAINTAIN AN INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO OF VARIOUS HOLDINGS, TYPES, AND MATURITIES. THESE INVESTMENTS ARE SUBJECT TO GENERAL CREDIT, LIQUIDITY, MARKET, AND

INTEREST RATE RISKS, WHICH MAY BE EXACERBATED BY UNUSUAL EVENTS THAT HAVE AFFECTED GLOBAL FINANCIAL MARKETS. A SIGNIFICANT PART OF OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO CONSISTS OF U.S. GOVERNMENT SECURITIES. IF GLOBAL CREDIT AND EQUITY MARKETS EXPERIENCE

PROLONGED PERIODS OF DECLINE, OR IF THE U.S. FEDERAL GOVERNMENT BUDGET PROCESS RESULTS IN A DEFAULT OR DOWNGRADE OF ITS DEBT, OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO MAY BE ADVERSELY IMPACTED AND WE COULD DETERMINE THAT MORE OF OUR INVESTMENTS HAVE EXPERIENCED AN

OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY DECLINE IN FAIR VALUE, REQUIRING IMPAIRMENT CHARGES THAT COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS.

WE HAVE

CLAIMS AND LAWSUITS AGAINST US THAT MAY RESULT IN ADVERSE OUTCOMES.

WE ARE SUBJECT TO A VARIETY OF CLAIMS AND LAWSUITS. ADVERSE OUTCOMES IN SOME OR ALL OF THESE CLAIMS MAY RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT MONETARY DAMAGES OR

INJUNCTIVE RELIEF THAT COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO CONDUCT OUR BUSINESS. ALTHOUGH MANAGEMENT CURRENTLY BELIEVES RESOLVING ALL OF THESE MATTERS, INDIVIDUALLY OR IN THE AGGREGATE, WILL NOT HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS, THE LITIGATION AND OTHER CLAIMS ARE SUBJECT TO INHERENT UNCERTAINTIES AND MANAGEMENTS VIEW OF THESE MATTERS MAY CHANGE IN THE FUTURE. A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ALSO COULD OCCUR FOR THE PERIOD IN WHICH

THE EFFECT OF AN UNFAVORABLE FINAL OUTCOME BECOMES PROBABLE AND REASONABLY ESTIMABLE.

WE MAY HAVE ADDITIONAL TAX

LIABILITIES.

WE ARE SUBJECT TO INCOME TAXES IN THE U.S. AND MANY FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS. SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT IS REQUIRED IN DETERMINING OUR WORLDWIDE PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES. IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF OUR BUSINESS,

THERE ARE MANY TRANSACTIONS AND CALCULATIONS WHERE THE ULTIMATE TAX DETERMINATION IS UNCERTAIN. WE REGULARLY ARE UNDER AUDIT BY TAX AUTHORITIES. ALTHOUGH WE BELIEVE OUR TAX ESTIMATES ARE REASONABLE, THE FINAL DETERMINATION OF TAX AUDITS AND ANY

RELATED LITIGATION COULD BE MATERIALLY DIFFERENT FROM OUR HISTORICAL INCOME TAX PROVISIONS AND ACCRUALS. THE RESULTS OF AN AUDIT OR LITIGATION COULD HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN THE PERIOD OR PERIODS FOR WHICH THAT

DETERMINATION IS MADE.

WE EARN A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF OUR OPERATING INCOME FROM OUTSIDE THE U.S., AND ANY REPATRIATION OF FUNDS

CURRENTLY HELD IN FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS MAY RESULT IN HIGHER EFFECTIVE TAX RATES FOR THE COMPANY. IN ADDITION, THERE HAVE BEEN PROPOSALS TO CHANGE U.S. TAX LAWS THAT WOULD SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT HOW U.S. MULTINATIONAL CORPORATIONS ARE TAXED ON FOREIGN

EARNINGS. ALTHOUGH WE CANNOT PREDICT WHETHER OR IN WHAT FORM THIS PROPOSED LEGISLATION MAY PASS, IF ENACTED IT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR TAX EXPENSE AND CASH FLOW.

OUR VERTICALLY-INTEGRATED HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE PRODUCTS MAY EXPERIENCE QUALITY OR SUPPLY PROBLEMS.

OUR HARDWARE

PRODUCTS SUCH AS THE XBOX 360 CONSOLE ARE HIGHLY COMPLEX AND CAN HAVE DEFECTS IN DESIGN, MANUFACTURE, OR ASSOCIATED SOFTWARE. WE COULD INCUR SIGNIFICANT EXPENSES, LOST REVENUE, AND REPUTATIONAL HARM IF WE FAIL TO DETECT OR EFFECTIVELY ADDRESS SUCH

ISSUES THROUGH DESIGN, TESTING, OR WARRANTY REPAIRS. WE OBTAIN SOME COMPONENTS OF OUR HARDWARE DEVICES FROM SOLE SUPPLIERS. IF A COMPONENT DELIVERY FROM A SOLE-SOURCE SUPPLIER IS DELAYED OR BECOMES UNAVAILABLE OR INDUSTRY SHORTAGES OCCUR, WE MAY BE

UNABLE TO OBTAIN TIMELY REPLACEMENT SUPPLIES, RESULTING IN REDUCED SALES. EITHER COMPONENT SHORTAGES OR EXCESS OR OBSOLETE INVENTORY MAY INCREASE OUR COST OF REVENUE. XBOX 360 CONSOLES ARE ASSEMBLED IN ASIA; DISRUPTIONS IN THE SUPPLY CHAIN MAY

RESULT IN CONSOLE SHORTAGES THAT WOULD AFFECT OUR REVENUE AND OPERATING MARGINS. THESE SAME RISKS WOULD APPLY TO ANY OTHER VERTICALLY-INTEGRATED HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE PRODUCTS WE MAY OFFER.

IF OUR GOODWILL OR AMORTIZABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS BECOME IMPAIRED WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO RECORD A SIGNIFICANT CHARGE TO

EARNINGS.

UNDER ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES (U.S. GAAP), WE REVIEW OUR AMORTIZABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS FOR IMPAIRMENT WHEN EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THE

CARRYING VALUE MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE. GOODWILL IS TESTED FOR IMPAIRMENT AT LEAST ANNUALLY. FACTORS THAT MAY BE CONSIDERED A CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES, INDICATING THAT THE CARRYING VALUE OF OUR GOODWILL OR AMORTIZABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS MAY NOT BE

RECOVERABLE, INCLUDE A DECLINE IN STOCK PRICE AND MARKET CAPITALIZATION, REDUCED FUTURE CASH FLOW ESTIMATES, AND SLOWER GROWTH RATES IN OUR INDUSTRY. WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO RECORD A SIGNIFICANT CHARGE IN OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS DURING THE PERIOD IN

WHICH ANY IMPAIRMENT OF OUR GOODWILL OR AMORTIZABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS IS DETERMINED, NEGATIVELY IMPACTING OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

WE OPERATE A GLOBAL BUSINESS THAT EXPOSES US TO ADDITIONAL RISKS.

WE

OPERATE IN OVER 100 COUNTRIES AND A SIGNIFICANT PART OF OUR REVENUE COMES FROM INTERNATIONAL SALES. PRESSURE TO MAKE OUR PRICING STRUCTURE UNIFORM MIGHT REQUIRE THAT WE REDUCE THE SALES PRICE OF OUR SOFTWARE IN THE U.S. AND OTHER COUNTRIES.

OPERATIONS OUTSIDE THE U.S. MAY BE AFFECTED BY CHANGES IN TRADE PROTECTION LAWS, POLICIES AND MEASURES, AND OTHER REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS AFFECTING TRADE AND INVESTMENT, INCLUDING THE FOREIGN CORRUPT PRACTICES ACT AND LOCAL LAWS PROHIBITING CORRUPT

PAYMENTS. EMERGING MARKETS ARE A SIGNIFICANT FOCUS OF OUR INTERNATIONAL GROWTH STRATEGY. THE DEVELOPING NATURE OF THESE MARKETS PRESENTS A NUMBER OF RISKS. DETERIORATION OF SOCIAL, POLITICAL, LABOR, OR ECONOMIC CONDITIONS IN A SPECIFIC COUNTRY OR

REGION AND DIFFICULTIES IN STAFFING AND MANAGING FOREIGN OPERATIONS MAY ALSO ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR OPERATIONS OR FINANCIAL RESULTS. ALTHOUGH WE HEDGE A PORTION OF OUR INTERNATIONAL CURRENCY EXPOSURE, SIGNIFICANT FLUCTUATIONS IN EXCHANGE RATES BETWEEN

THE U.S. DOLLAR AND FOREIGN CURRENCIES MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR NET REVENUE.

CATASTROPHIC EVENTS OR GEO-POLITICAL CONDITIONS MAY

DISRUPT OUR BUSINESS.

A DISRUPTION OR FAILURE OF OUR SYSTEMS OR OPERATIONS IN THE EVENT OF A MAJOR EARTHQUAKE, WEATHER EVENT, CYBER-ATTACK, TERRORIST ATTACK, OR OTHER CATASTROPHIC EVENT COULD CAUSE DELAYS IN COMPLETING

SALES, PROVIDING SERVICES, OR PERFORMING OTHER MISSION-CRITICAL FUNCTIONS. OUR CORPORATE HEADQUARTERS, A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES, AND CERTAIN OTHER CRITICAL BUSINESS OPERATIONS ARE LOCATED IN THE SEATTLE,

WASHINGTON AREA, AND WE HAVE OTHER BUSINESS OPERATIONS IN THE SILICON VALLEY AREA OF CALIFORNIA, BOTH OF WHICH ARE NEAR MAJOR EARTHQUAKE FAULTS. A CATASTROPHIC EVENT THAT RESULTS IN THE DESTRUCTION OR DISRUPTION OF ANY OF OUR CRITICAL BUSINESS OR

INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS COULD HARM OUR ABILITY TO CONDUCT NORMAL BUSINESS OPERATIONS. OUR MOVE TOWARD PROVIDING OUR CUSTOMERS WITH MORE SERVICES AND SOLUTIONS IN THE CLOUD PUTS A PREMIUM ON THE RESILIENCE OF OUR SYSTEMS AND STRENGTH OF OUR

BUSINESS CONTINUITY MANAGEMENT PLANS, AND MAGNIFIES THE POTENTIAL IMPACT OF PROLONGED OUTAGES ON OUR OPERATING RESULTS. ABRUPT POLITICAL CHANGE, TERRORIST ACTIVITY, AND ARMED CONFLICT POSE A RISK OF GENERAL ECONOMIC DISRUPTION IN AFFECTED COUNTRIES,

WHICH MAY INCREASE OUR OPERATING COSTS. THESE CONDITIONS ALSO MAY ADD UNCERTAINTY TO THE TIMING AND BUDGET FOR TECHNOLOGY INVESTMENT DECISIONS BY OUR CUSTOMERS, AND MAY RESULT IN SUPPLY CHAIN DISRUPTIONS FOR HARDWARE MANUFACTURERS, EITHER OF WHICH

MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR REVENUE. THE LONG-TERM EFFECTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE ON THE GLOBAL ECONOMY IN GENERAL OR THE INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY INDUSTRY IN PARTICULAR ARE UNCLEAR. ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS OR CHANGES IN THE SUPPLY, DEMAND OR AVAILABLE

SOURCES OF ENERGY MAY AFFECT THE AVAILABILITY OR COST OF GOODS AND SERVICES, INCLUDING NATURAL RESOURCES, NECESSARY TO RUN OUR BUSINESS. CHANGES IN WEATHER WHERE WE OPERATE MAY INCREASE THE COSTS OF POWERING AND COOLING COMPUTER HARDWARE WE USE TO

DEVELOP SOFTWARE AND PROVIDE CLOUD-BASED SERVICES. NEW REGULATIONS MAY REQUIRE US TO FIND ALTERNATIVE COMPLIANT AND COST-EFFECTIVE METHODS OF DISTRIBUTING OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES.

ACQUISITIONS, JOINT VENTURES AND STRATEGIC ALLIANCES MAY HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS.

WE EXPECT TO

CONTINUE MAKING ACQUISITIONS OR ENTERING INTO JOINT VENTURES AND STRATEGIC ALLIANCES AS PART OF OUR LONG-TERM BUSINESS STRATEGY. THESE TRANSACTIONS INVOLVE SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES AND RISKS INCLUDING THAT THE TRANSACTION DOES NOT ADVANCE OUR BUSINESS

STRATEGY, THAT WE DONT REALIZE A SATISFACTORY RETURN ON OUR INVESTMENT, OR THAT WE EXPERIENCE DIFFICULTY INTEGRATING NEW EMPLOYEES, BUSINESS SYSTEMS, AND TECHNOLOGY, OR DIVERSION OF MANAGEMENTS ATTENTION FROM OUR OTHER BUSINESSES. IT MAY

TAKE LONGER THAN EXPECTED TO REALIZE THE FULL BENEFITS, SUCH AS INCREASED REVENUE, ENHANCED EFFICIENCIES, OR MARKET SHARE, OR THOSE BENEFITS MAY ULTIMATELY BE SMALLER THAN ANTICIPATED, OR MAY NOT BE REALIZED. THESE EVENTS COULD HARM OUR OPERATING

RESULTS OR FINANCIAL CONDITION.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

THE FOLLOWING MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (MD&A) IS INTENDED TO HELP THE READER UNDERSTAND THE

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION OF MICROSOFT CORPORATION. MD&A IS PROVIDED AS A SUPPLEMENT TO, AND SHOULD BE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH, OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND THE ACCOMPANYING NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

OVERVIEW AND OUTLOOK

MICROSOFT IS A TECHNOLOGY LEADER FOCUSED ON HELPING PEOPLE AND BUSINESSES THROUGHOUT THE WORLD REALIZE THEIR FULL POTENTIAL. WE CREATE TECHNOLOGY

THAT TRANSFORMS THE WAY PEOPLE WORK, PLAY AND COMMUNICATE ACROSS A WIDE RANGE OF COMPUTING DEVICES.

WE GENERATE REVENUE BY DEVELOPING,

LICENSING, AND SUPPORTING A WIDE RANGE OF SOFTWARE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, BY DESIGNING AND SELLING HARDWARE, AND BY DELIVERING RELEVANT ONLINE ADVERTISING TO A GLOBAL CUSTOMER AUDIENCE. OUR MOST SIGNIFICANT EXPENSES ARE RELATED TO COMPENSATING

EMPLOYEES, DESIGNING, MANUFACTURING, MARKETING AND SELLING OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, AND INCOME TAXES.

INDUSTRY TRENDS

OUR INDUSTRY IS DYNAMIC AND HIGHLY COMPETITIVE, WITH FREQUENT CHANGES IN BOTH TECHNOLOGIES AND BUSINESS MODELS. EACH INDUSTRY SHIFT IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO CONCEIVE NEW PRODUCTS, NEW TECHNOLOGIES, OR NEW IDEAS WHICH

CAN FURTHER TRANSFORM THE INDUSTRY AND OUR BUSINESS. AT MICROSOFT, WE PUSH THE BOUNDARIES OF WHAT IS POSSIBLE THROUGH A BROAD SET OF RESEARCH AND TECHNOLOGY INNOVATIONS THAT SEEK TO ANTICIPATE THE CHANGING DEMANDS OF CUSTOMERS, INDUSTRY TRENDS, AND

COMPETITIVE FORCES.

KEY OPPORTUNITIES AND INVESTMENTS

BASED ON OUR ASSESSMENT OF KEY TECHNOLOGY TRENDS AND OUR BROAD FOCUS ON LONG-TERM RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT OF NEW PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, WE SEE SIGNIFICANT OPPORTUNITIES TO DRIVE FUTURE GROWTH.

SMART CONNECTED DEVICES

THE PRICE PER UNIT

OF PROCESSING, STORAGE, AND NETWORKS CONTINUES TO DECLINE WHILE AT THE SAME TIME DEVICES INCREASE IN CAPABILITY. THIS ONGOING TREND IS INCREASING THE CAPABILITIES OF PCS, MOBILE, AND OTHER DEVICES POWERED BY RICH SOFTWARE PLATFORMS AND APPLICATIONS.

AT THE SAME TIME, THE INFORMATION AND SERVICES PEOPLE USE INCREASINGLY SPAN MULTIPLE DEVICES. USER EXPERIENCES WILL BE TRANSFORMED BY THE ADOPTION OF CLOUD COMPUTING WHEN BROUGHT TOGETHER WITH THE RICHNESS OF SMART, CONNECTED DEVICES. MICROSOFT IS

DELIVERING EXPERIENCES THAT SEAMLESSLY CONNECT PCS AND MOBILE AND OTHER DEVICES THROUGH THE CLOUD. WE ARE DEVOTING SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES TO CONSUMER CLOUD OFFERINGS LIKE BING, WINDOWS LIVE, AND XBOX LIVE. OUR SOFTWARE AND HARDWARE PLATFORM

INVESTMENTS CAN BE SEEN IN PRODUCTS LIKE KINECT, WINDOWS, WINDOWS AZURE, WINDOWS PHONE, WINDOWS SERVER, AND XBOX.

CLOUD COMPUTING TRANSFORMING THE

DATA CENTER AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY

CLOUD-BASED SOLUTIONS PROVIDE CUSTOMERS WITH SOFTWARE, SERVICES AND CONTENT OVER THE

INTERNET BY WAY OF SHARED COMPUTING RESOURCES LOCATED IN CENTRALIZED DATA CENTERS. COMPUTING IS UNDERGOING A LONG-TERM SHIFT FROM CLIENT/SERVER TO THE CLOUD, A SHIFT SIMILAR IN IMPORTANCE AND IMPACT TO THE TRANSITION FROM MAINFRAME TO CLIENT/SERVER.

THE SHIFT TO THE CLOUD IS DRIVEN BY THREE IMPORTANT ECONOMIES OF SCALE: LARGER DATA CENTERS CAN DEPLOY COMPUTATIONAL RESOURCES AT SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER COST THAN SMALLER ONES; LARGER DATA CENTERS INCLUDE DIVERSE CUSTOMER, GEOGRAPHIC, AND APPLICATION

DEMAND PATTERNS WHICH IMPROVE THE UTILIZATION OF COMPUTING, STORAGE, AND NETWORK RESOURCES; AND MULTI-TENANCY LOWERS APPLICATION MAINTENANCE LABOR COSTS FOR LARGE PUBLIC CLOUDS. AS A RESULT OF THE IMPROVED ECONOMICS, THE CLOUD OFFERS UNIQUE LEVELS

OF ELASTICITY AND AGILITY THAT WILL ENABLE NEW SOLUTIONS AND APPLICATIONS. FOR BUSINESSES OF ALL SIZES, THE CLOUD CREATES THE OPPORTUNITY TO FOCUS MORE ON INNOVATION WHILE LEAVING NON-DIFFERENTIATING ACTIVITIES TO RELIABLE AND COST-EFFECTIVE

PROVIDERS. FOR MOST BUSINESSES, THE FIRST STEP IN ACHIEVING CLOUD ECONOMICS IS THE ADOPTION OF VIRTUALIZATION IN THEIR DATA CENTER. WE ARE DEVOTING SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES TO DEVELOPING CLOUD INFRASTRUCTURE, PLATFORMS, AND APPLICATIONS INCLUDING

OFFERINGS SUCH AS MICROSOFT DYNAMICS ONLINE, MICROSOFT SQL AZURE, OFFICE 365, WINDOWS AZURE, WINDOWS INTUNE, AND WINDOWS SERVER.

ENTERTAINMENT

THE EVOLUTION OF HARDWARE, SOFTWARE, SERVICES, AND THE CLOUD ARE ENHANCING THE DELIVERY AND QUALITY OF UNIFIED ENTERTAINMENT

EXPERIENCES ACROSS MANY DEVICES. THESE RICH MEDIA EXPERIENCES INCLUDE GAMES, MOVIES, MUSIC, TELEVISION, AND SOCIAL INTERACTIONS WITH FAMILY, FRIENDS, AND COLLEAGUES. AT MICROSOFT, OUR APPROACH IS TO SIMPLIFY AND INCREASE THE ACCESSIBILITY OF THESE

ENTERTAINMENT EXPERIENCES TO BROADEN MARKET PENETRATION OF OUR SOFTWARE AND SERVICES. WE INVEST SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES IN PARTNERSHIPS, CONTENT, WINDOWS PHONE, XBOX, AND XBOX LIVE.

SEARCH

OVER THE LAST TWO DECADES, WEB CONTENT AND SOCIAL CONNECTIONS HAVE INCREASED

DRAMATICALLY AS PEOPLE SPEND MORE TIME ONLINE, WHILE DISCOVERABILITY AND ACCESSIBILITY HAS BEEN TRANSFORMING FROM DIRECT NAVIGATION AND DOCUMENT LINKS. THERE IS SIGNIFICANT OPPORTUNITY TO DELIVER DIFFERENTIATED PRODUCTS THAT HELPS USERS MAKE BETTER

DECISIONS AND

23

ITEM 7

COMPLETE TASKS MORE SIMPLY WHEN USING PC, MOBILE, AND OTHER DEVICES. OUR APPROACH IS TO USE MACHINE LEARNING TO TRY TO UNDERSTAND USER INTENT, AND DIFFERENTIATE OUR PRODUCT BY FOCUSING ON THE

INTEGRATION OF VISUAL, SOCIAL, AND OTHER ELEMENTS WHICH SIMPLIFIES PEOPLES INTERACTION WITH THE INTERNET. WE INVEST SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES IN BING, SHAREPOINT, WINDOWS, AND WINDOWS PHONE.

COMMUNICATIONS AND PRODUCTIVITY

PERSONAL

AND BUSINESS PRODUCTIVITY HAS BEEN TRANSFORMED BY THE UBIQUITY OF COMPUTING AND SOFTWARE TOOLS. OVER THE LAST DECADE, MICROSOFT REDEFINED SOFTWARE PRODUCTIVITY BEYOND THE RICH OFFICE CLIENT ON THE PC. PRODUCTIVITY SCENARIOS NOW ENCOMPASS UNIFIED

COMMUNICATIONS, BUSINESS INTELLIGENCE, COLLABORATION, CONTENT MANAGEMENT, AND RELATIONSHIP MANAGEMENT, WHICH ARE INCREASINGLY POWERED BY SERVER-SIDE APPLICATIONS. THESE SERVER APPLICATIONS CAN BE HOSTED BY THE CUSTOMER, A PARTNER, OR BY MICROSOFT IN

THE CLOUD. THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT OPPORTUNITIES TO PROVIDE PRODUCTIVITY AND COMMUNICATION SCENARIOS ACROSS PCS, MOBILE DEVICES, AND OTHER DEVICES THAT CONNECT TO SERVICES. WE INVEST SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES IN DYNAMICS, EXCHANGE, LYNC, OFFICE, OFFICE

365, SHAREPOINT, AND WINDOWS LIVE.

ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, CHALLENGES AND RISKS

AS DISCUSSED ABOVE, OUR INDUSTRY IS DYNAMIC AND HIGHLY COMPETITIVE. WE MUST ANTICIPATE CHANGES IN TECHNOLOGY AND BUSINESS MODELS. OUR MODEL FOR

GROWTH IS BASED ON OUR ABILITY TO INITIATE AND EMBRACE DISRUPTIVE TECHNOLOGY TRENDS, TO ENTER NEW MARKETS, BOTH IN TERMS OF GEOGRAPHIES AND PRODUCT AREAS, AND TO DRIVE BROAD ADOPTION OF THE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES WE DEVELOP AND MARKET.

AT MICROSOFT, WE PRIORITIZE OUR INVESTMENTS AMONG THE HIGHEST LONG-TERM GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES. THESE INVESTMENTS REQUIRE SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES AND

ARE MULTI-YEAR IN NATURE. THE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES WE BRING TO MARKET CAN BE BUILT INTERNALLY, BROUGHT TO MARKET AS PART OF A PARTNERSHIP OR ALLIANCE, OR THROUGH ACQUISITION.

OUR SUCCESS IS HIGHLY DEPENDENT ON OUR ABILITY TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN QUALIFIED EMPLOYEES. WE RELY ON HIRING FROM A MIX OF UNIVERSITY AND INDUSTRY TALENT WORLDWIDE. MICROSOFT COMPETES FOR TALENTED INDIVIDUALS

WORLDWIDE BY OFFERING BROAD CUSTOMER REACH, SCALE IN RESOURCES, AND COMPETITIVE COMPENSATION.

DEMAND FOR OUR SOFTWARE, SERVICES, AND

HARDWARE HAS A STRONG CORRELATION TO GLOBAL MACROECONOMIC FACTORS. THE CURRENT MACROECONOMIC FACTORS REMAIN DYNAMIC. SEE A DISCUSSION OF THESE FACTORS AND OTHER RISKS UNDER RISK FACTORS (PART 1, ITEM 1A. OF THIS FORM 10-K).

SEASONALITY

OUR REVENUE HISTORICALLY HAS

SALES AND MARKETING EXPENSES INCREASED PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF INCREASED ADVERTISING AND MARKETING OF THE XBOX 360 PLATFORM, WINDOWS PHONE, AND WINDOWS AND WINDOWS LIVE, A 5% INCREASE IN HEADCOUNT-RELATED

EXPENSES, AND INCREASED FEES PAID TO THIRD PARTY ENTERPRISE SOFTWARE ADVISORS.

FISCAL YEAR 2010 COMPARED WITH FISCAL YEAR 2009

EMPLOYEE BENEFITS, STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE, SEVERANCE EXPENSE, AND OTHER HEADCOUNT-RELATED EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH FINANCE, LEGAL, FACILITIES, CERTAIN HUMAN RESOURCES AND OTHER ADMINISTRATIVE PERSONNEL, CERTAIN TAXES, AND LEGAL AND OTHER

ADMINISTRATIVE FEES.

FISCAL YEAR 2011 COMPARED WITH FISCAL YEAR 2010

GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES INCREASED PRIMARILY DUE TO A 12% INCREASE IN HEADCOUNT-RELATED EXPENSES AND NEW PUERTO RICAN EXCISE TAXES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY PRIOR YEAR TRANSITION EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH THE

INCEPTION OF THE YAHOO! COMMERCIAL AGREEMENT.

FISCAL YEAR 2010 COMPARED WITH FISCAL YEAR 2009

GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES INCREASED DUE TO INCREASED LEGAL CHARGES, AS DISCUSSED ABOVE WITHIN CORPORATE-LEVEL ACTIVITY, AND TRANSITION

EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH THE INCEPTION OF THE YAHOO! COMMERCIAL AGREEMENT. THESE INCREASES WERE OFFSET IN PART BY A 6% REDUCTION IN HEADCOUNT-RELATED EXPENSES AND LOWER SEVERANCE COSTS. DURING FISCAL YEARS 2010 AND 2009, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE

EXPENSES INCLUDED EMPLOYEE SEVERANCE EXPENSE OF $59 MILLION AND $330 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, ASSOCIATED WITH A RESOURCE MANAGEMENT PROGRAM THAT WAS ANNOUNCED IN JANUARY 2009 AND COMPLETED IN FISCAL YEAR 2010.

WE USE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS TO MANAGE RISKS RELATED TO FOREIGN CURRENCIES, EQUITY PRICES, INTEREST RATES, AND

CREDIT; TO ENHANCE INVESTMENT RETURNS; AND TO FACILITATE PORTFOLIO DIVERSIFICATION. GAINS AND LOSSES FROM CHANGES IN FAIR VALUES OF DERIVATIVES THAT ARE NOT DESIGNATED AS HEDGES ARE RECOGNIZED IN OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE). THESE ARE GENERALLY OFFSET BY

UNREALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES IN THE UNDERLYING SECURITIES IN THE INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO AND ARE RECORDED AS A COMPONENT OF OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME.

FISCAL YEAR 2011 COMPARED WITH FISCAL YEAR 2010

DIVIDENDS AND INTEREST INCOME INCREASED DUE TO HIGHER AVERAGE PORTFOLIO INVESTMENT BALANCES, OFFSET IN PART BY LOWER YIELDS ON OUR FIXED-INCOME INVESTMENTS. INTEREST EXPENSE INCREASED DUE TO OUR INCREASED ISSUANCE

OF DEBT. NET RECOGNIZED GAINS ON INVESTMENTS INCREASED DUE PRIMARILY TO HIGHER GAINS ON SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES, OFFSET IN PART BY FEWER GAINS ON SALES OF FIXED-INCOME SECURITIES. DERIVATIVE LOSSES DECREASED DUE PRIMARILY TO HIGHER GAINS ON

COMMODITY DERIVATIVES OFFSET IN PART BY HIGHER LOSSES ON CURRENCY CONTRACTS USED TO HEDGE FOREIGN CURRENCY REVENUE.

FISCAL YEAR 2010 COMPARED WITH

FISCAL YEAR 2009

DIVIDENDS AND INTEREST INCOME INCREASED PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER AVERAGE PORTFOLIO INVESTMENT BALANCES, OFFSET IN

PART BY LOWER YIELDS ON OUR FIXED-INCOME INVESTMENTS. INTEREST EXPENSE INCREASED DUE TO OUR ISSUANCE OF LONG TERM DEBT IN MAY 2009. NET RECOGNIZED GAINS ON INVESTMENTS INCREASED PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENTS, OFFSET IN PART

BY LOWER GAINS ON SALES OF INVESTMENTS IN THE CURRENT PERIOD. OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENTS WERE $69 MILLION DURING FISCAL YEAR 2010, AS COMPARED WITH $862 MILLION DURING FISCAL YEAR 2009 AND DECREASED PRIMARILY DUE TO IMPROVEMENTS IN MARKET

CONDITIONS. NET LOSSES ON DERIVATIVES DECREASED DUE TO GAINS ON EQUITY AND INTEREST RATE DERIVATIVES AS COMPARED TO LOSSES IN THE PRIOR PERIOD AND LOWER LOSSES ON COMMODITY AND FOREIGN CURRENCY CONTRACTS IN THE CURRENT PERIOD. NET GAINS FROM FOREIGN

CURRENCY REMEASUREMENTS WERE INSIGNIFICANT IN FISCAL YEAR 2010 COMPARED TO NET LOSSES OF $509 MILLION IN THE PRIOR YEAR, WHICH HAD RESULTED FROM THE STRENGTHENING OF THE U.S. DOLLAR IN THE PRIOR YEAR. FOR FISCAL YEAR 2010, OTHER INCLUDES A GAIN ON

THE DIVESTITURE OF RAZORFISH.

INCOME TAXES

FISCAL YEAR 2011 COMPARED WITH FISCAL YEAR 2010

OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATES FOR FISCAL YEARS 2011 AND 2010 WERE APPROXIMATELY 18% AND 25%, RESPECTIVELY. OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE WAS LOWER THAN THE U.S. FEDERAL STATUTORY RATE AND OUR PRIOR YEAR EFFECTIVE RATE PRIMARILY

DUE TO A HIGHER MIX OF EARNINGS TAXED AT LOWER RATES IN FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS RESULTING FROM PRODUCING AND DISTRIBUTING OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES THROUGH OUR FOREIGN REGIONAL OPERATIONS CENTERS IN IRELAND, SINGAPORE, AND PUERTO RICO, WHICH ARE

SUBJECT TO

LOWER INCOME TAX RATES. IN FISCAL YEARS 2011 AND 2010, OUR U.S. INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES WAS $8.9 BILLION AND $9.6 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY, AND COMPRISED 32% AND 38%, RESPECTIVELY, OF OUR

INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES. IN FISCAL YEARS 2011 AND 2010, THE FOREIGN INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES WAS $19.2 BILLION AND $15.4 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY, AND COMPRISED 68% AND 62%, RESPECTIVELY, OF OUR INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES. IN FISCAL YEARS

2011 AND 2010, THE REDUCTION OF THE U.S. FEDERAL STATUTORY RATE AS A RESULT OF FOREIGN EARNINGS TAXED AT LOWER RATES WAS 16% AND 12%, RESPECTIVELY.

IN ADDITION, OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE WAS LOWER THAN IN THE PRIOR YEAR DUE TO A PARTIAL SETTLEMENT WITH THE I.R.S. IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL YEAR 2011 RELATING TO THE AUDIT OF TAX YEARS 2004 TO 2006. THIS

PARTIAL SETTLEMENT REDUCED OUR INCOME TAX EXPENSE FOR FISCAL YEAR 2011 BY $461 MILLION.

TAX CONTINGENCIES AND OTHER TAX LIABILITIES

WERE $7.4 BILLION AND $6.9 BILLION AS OF JUNE 30, 2011 AND 2010, RESPECTIVELY, AND ARE INCLUDED IN OTHER LONG-TERM LIABILITIES. WE HAVE NOT PROVIDED DEFERRED U.S. INCOME TAXES OR FOREIGN WITHHOLDING TAXES ON TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES OF

APPROXIMATELY $44.8 BILLION RESULTING FROM EARNINGS FOR CERTAIN NON-U.S. SUBSIDIARIES BECAUSE THEY ARE PERMANENTLY REINVESTED OUTSIDE THE U.S. THE UNRECOGNIZED DEFERRED TAX LIABILITY ASSOCIATED WITH THESE TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES WAS APPROXIMATELY

$14.2 BILLION AS OF JUNE 30, 2011.

WHILE WE SETTLED A PORTION OF THE I.R.S. AUDIT FOR TAX YEARS 2004 TO 2006 DURING THE THIRD

QUARTER OF FISCAL YEAR 2011, WE REMAIN UNDER AUDIT FOR THESE YEARS. DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF FISCAL YEAR 2011, THE I.R.S. COMPLETED ITS EXAMINATION AND ISSUED A REVENUE AGENTS REPORT (RAR) FOR THE REMAINING UNRESOLVED ITEMS. WE

DO NOT AGREE WITH THE ADJUSTMENTS IN THE RAR, AND WE HAVE FILED A PROTEST TO INITIATE THE ADMINISTRATIVE APPEALS PROCESS. THE PROPOSED ADJUSTMENTS ARE PRIMARILY RELATED TO TRANSFER PRICING AND COULD HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON OUR FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS IF NOT RESOLVED FAVORABLY; HOWEVER, WE BELIEVE OUR EXISTING RESERVES ARE ADEQUATE. WE DO NOT BELIEVE IT IS REASONABLY POSSIBLE THAT THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS WILL SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE OR DECREASE WITHIN THE NEXT 12

MONTHS, AS WE DO NOT BELIEVE THE APPEALS PROCESS WILL BE CONCLUDED WITHIN THE NEXT 12 MONTHS. WE ALSO CONTINUE TO BE SUBJECT TO EXAMINATION BY THE I.R.S. FOR TAX YEARS 2007 TO 2010.

FISCAL YEAR 2010 COMPARED WITH FISCAL YEAR 2009

OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATES IN FISCAL YEARS 2010

AND 2009 WERE APPROXIMATELY 25% AND 27%, RESPECTIVELY. IN FISCAL YEARS 2010 AND 2009, THE REDUCTION TO THE U.S. FEDERAL STATUTORY RATE AS A RESULT OF FOREIGN EARNINGS TAXED AT LOWER RATES WAS 12% AND 9%, RESPECTIVELY, REFLECTING THE MIX OF U.S. AND

INTERNATIONAL INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES AND THE IMPACT OF CHANGES IN UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS RELATED TO INTERNATIONAL INCOME. IN FISCAL YEARS 2010 AND 2009, FOREIGN INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES WAS $15.4 BILLION AND $14.3 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY.

FINANCIAL CONDITION

CASH,

CASH EQUIVALENTS, AND INVESTMENTS

CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS, AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS TOTALED $52.8 BILLION AS OF JUNE 30,

2011, COMPARED WITH $36.8 BILLION AS OF JUNE 30, 2010. EQUITY AND OTHER INVESTMENTS WERE $10.9 BILLION AS OF JUNE 30, 2011, COMPARED WITH $7.8 BILLION AS OF JUNE 30, 2010. OUR SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS ARE PRIMARILY TO FACILITATE

LIQUIDITY AND FOR CAPITAL PRESERVATION. THEY CONSIST PREDOMINANTLY OF HIGHLY LIQUID INVESTMENT-GRADE FIXED-INCOME SECURITIES, DIVERSIFIED AMONG INDUSTRIES AND INDIVIDUAL ISSUERS. THE INVESTMENTS ARE PREDOMINANTLY U.S. DOLLAR-DENOMINATED SECURITIES,

BUT ALSO INCLUDE FOREIGN CURRENCY-DENOMINATED SECURITIES IN ORDER TO DIVERSIFY RISK. OUR FIXED-INCOME INVESTMENTS ARE EXPOSED TO INTEREST RATE RISK AND CREDIT RISK. THE CREDIT RISK AND AVERAGE MATURITY OF OUR FIXED-INCOME PORTFOLIO ARE MANAGED TO

ACHIEVE ECONOMIC RETURNS THAT CORRELATE TO CERTAIN FIXED-INCOME INDICES. THE SETTLEMENT RISK RELATED TO THESE INVESTMENTS IS INSIGNIFICANT GIVEN THAT THE SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS HELD ARE PRIMARILY HIGHLY LIQUID INVESTMENT-GRADE FIXED-INCOME

SECURITIES. WHILE WE OWN CERTAIN MORTGAGE-BACKED AND ASSET-BACKED FIXED-INCOME SECURITIES, OUR PORTFOLIO AS OF JUNE 30, 2011 DOES NOT CONTAIN DIRECT EXPOSURE TO SUBPRIME MORTGAGES OR STRUCTURED VEHICLES THAT DERIVE THEIR VALUE FROM SUBPRIME

COLLATERAL. THE MAJORITY OF OUR MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES ARE COLLATERALIZED BY PRIME RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGES AND CARRY A 100% PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST GUARANTEE, PRIMARILY FROM FEDERAL NATIONAL MORTGAGE ASSOCIATION, FEDERAL HOME LOAN MORTGAGE

CORPORATION, AND GOVERNMENT NATIONAL MORTGAGE ASSOCIATION.

ITEM 7

OF THE CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS, AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS AT JUNE 30, 2011, APPROXIMATELY $45

BILLION WAS HELD BY OUR FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES AND WERE SUBJECT TO MATERIAL REPATRIATION TAX EFFECTS. THE AMOUNT OF CASH AND INVESTMENTS HELD BY FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES SUBJECT TO OTHER RESTRICTIONS ON THE FREE FLOW OF FUNDS (PRIMARILY CURRENCY AND OTHER

LOCAL REGULATORY) WAS APPROXIMATELY $379 MILLION. AS OF JUNE 30, 2011, APPROXIMATELY 68% OF THE SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS HELD BY OUR FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES WERE INVESTED IN U.S. GOVERNMENT AND AGENCY SECURITIES, APPROXIMATELY 12% WERE INVESTED IN

CORPORATE NOTES AND BONDS OF U.S. COMPANIES, AND 5% WERE INVESTED IN U.S. MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES, ALL OF WHICH ARE DENOMINATED IN U.S. DOLLARS.

SECURITIES LENDING

WE LEND CERTAIN

FIXED-INCOME AND EQUITY SECURITIES TO INCREASE INVESTMENT RETURNS. THE LOANED SECURITIES CONTINUE TO BE CARRIED AS INVESTMENTS ON OUR BALANCE SHEET. CASH AND/OR SECURITY INTERESTS ARE RECEIVED AS COLLATERAL FOR THE LOANED SECURITIES WITH THE AMOUNT

DETERMINED BASED UPON THE UNDERLYING SECURITY LENT AND THE CREDITWORTHINESS OF THE BORROWER. CASH RECEIVED IS RECORDED AS AN ASSET WITH A CORRESPONDING LIABILITY. OUR SECURITIES LENDING PAYABLE BALANCE WAS $1.2 BILLION AS OF JUNE 30, 2011. OUR

AVERAGE AND MAXIMUM SECURITIES LENDING PAYABLE BALANCES FOR THE FISCAL YEAR WERE $1.6 BILLION AND $3.3 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY. INTRA-YEAR VARIANCES IN THE AMOUNT OF SECURITIES LOANED ARE MAINLY DUE TO FLUCTUATIONS IN THE DEMAND FOR THE SECURITIES.

VALUATION

IN GENERAL, AND

WHERE APPLICABLE, WE USE QUOTED PRICES IN ACTIVE MARKETS FOR IDENTICAL ASSETS OR LIABILITIES TO DETERMINE THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS. THIS PRICING METHODOLOGY APPLIES TO OUR LEVEL 1 INVESTMENTS, SUCH AS EXCHANGE-TRADED MUTUAL

FUNDS, DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL EQUITIES, AND U.S. TREASURIES. IF QUOTED PRICES IN ACTIVE MARKETS FOR IDENTICAL ASSETS OR LIABILITIES ARE NOT AVAILABLE TO DETERMINE FAIR VALUE, THEN WE USE QUOTED PRICES FOR SIMILAR ASSETS AND LIABILITIES OR

INPUTS OTHER THAN THE QUOTED PRICES THAT ARE OBSERVABLE EITHER DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY. THIS PRICING METHODOLOGY APPLIES TO OUR LEVEL 2 INVESTMENTS SUCH AS CORPORATE NOTES AND BONDS, FOREIGN GOVERNMENT BONDS, MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES, AND AGENCY

SECURITIES. LEVEL 3 INVESTMENTS ARE VALUED USING INTERNALLY DEVELOPED MODELS WITH UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS. ASSETS AND LIABILITIES MEASURED USING UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS ARE AN IMMATERIAL PORTION OF OUR PORTFOLIO.

A MAJORITY OF OUR INVESTMENTS ARE PRICED BY PRICING VENDORS AND ARE GENERALLY LEVEL 1 OR LEVEL 2 INVESTMENTS AS THESE VENDORS EITHER PROVIDE A

QUOTED MARKET PRICE IN AN ACTIVE MARKET OR USE OBSERVABLE INPUTS FOR THEIR PRICING WITHOUT APPLYING SIGNIFICANT ADJUSTMENTS. BROKER PRICING IS USED MAINLY WHEN A QUOTED PRICE IS NOT AVAILABLE, THE INVESTMENT IS NOT PRICED BY OUR PRICING

VENDORS, OR WHEN A BROKER PRICE IS MORE REFLECTIVE OF FAIR VALUES IN THE MARKET IN WHICH THE INVESTMENT TRADES. OUR BROKER-PRICED INVESTMENTS ARE GENERALLY LABELED AS LEVEL 2 INVESTMENTS BECAUSE THE BROKER PRICES THESE INVESTMENTS BASED ON SIMILAR

ASSETS WITHOUT APPLYING SIGNIFICANT ADJUSTMENTS. IN ADDITION, ALL OF OUR BROKER-PRICED INVESTMENTS HAVE A SUFFICIENT LEVEL OF TRADING VOLUME TO DEMONSTRATE THAT THE FAIR VALUES USED ARE APPROPRIATE FOR THESE INVESTMENTS. OUR FAIR VALUE

PROCESSES INCLUDE CONTROLS THAT ARE DESIGNED TO ENSURE APPROPRIATE FAIR VALUES ARE RECORDED. THESE CONTROLS INCLUDE MODEL VALIDATION, REVIEW OF KEY MODEL INPUTS, ANALYSIS OF PERIOD-OVER-PERIOD FLUCTUATIONS, AND INDEPENDENT RECALCULATION OF

PRICES WHERE APPROPRIATE.

CASH FLOWS

FISCAL

YEAR 2011 COMPARED WITH FISCAL YEAR 2010

CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS INCREASED $2.9 BILLION DURING THE CURRENT FISCAL YEAR TO $27.0

BILLION DUE MAINLY TO INCREASED REVENUE AND CASH COLLECTIONS FROM CUSTOMERS. CASH USED IN FINANCING DECREASED $4.9 BILLION TO $8.4 BILLION DUE MAINLY TO A $5.8 BILLION INCREASE IN PROCEEDS FROM ISSUANCE OF DEBT, NET OF REPAYMENTS, OFFSET IN PART BY

A $602 MILLION INCREASE IN CASH PAID FOR DIVIDENDS. CASH USED IN INVESTING INCREASED $3.3 BILLION TO $14.6 BILLION DUE TO A $5.8 BILLION INCREASE IN PURCHASES OF INVESTMENTS, OFFSET IN PART BY A $2.5 BILLION INCREASE IN CASH FROM SECURITIES LENDING.

FISCAL YEAR 2010 COMPARED WITH FISCAL YEAR 2009

CASH FLOW FROM OPERATIONS INCREASED $5.0 BILLION, PRIMARILY DUE TO PAYMENT OF $4.1 BILLION TO THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE IN THE PRIOR YEAR AS A RESULT OF OUR SETTLEMENT OF THE 2000-2003 AUDIT EXAMINATION ALONG

WITH INCREASED CASH RECEIVED FROM CUSTOMERS IN THE CURRENT YEAR. CASH USED FOR FINANCING INCREASED $5.8 BILLION, PRIMARILY DUE TO A $5.6

MATURITIES ALONG WITH A $1.1 BILLION DECREASE IN ADDITIONS TO PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT.

DEBT

SHORT-TERM DEBT

DURING FISCAL YEAR 2011,

WE REPAID $1.0 BILLION OF COMMERCIAL PAPER, LEAVING ZERO OUTSTANDING.

ON NOVEMBER 5, 2010, OUR $1.0 BILLION 364-DAY CREDIT

FACILITY EXPIRED. THIS FACILITY SERVED AS A BACK-UP FOR OUR COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAM. NO AMOUNTS WERE DRAWN AGAINST THE CREDIT FACILITY DURING ANY OF THE PERIODS PRESENTED.

LONG-TERM DEBT

WE ISSUED DEBT DURING THE PERIODS PRESENTED TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF FAVORABLE

PRICING AND LIQUIDITY IN THE DEBT MARKETS, REFLECTING OUR SUPERIOR CREDIT RATING AND THE LOW INTEREST RATE ENVIRONMENT. THE PROCEEDS OF THESE ISSUANCES WERE USED TO PARTIALLY FUND DISCRETIONARY BUSINESS ACQUISITIONS AND SHARE REPURCHASES.

AS OF JUNE 30, 2011, THE TOTAL CARRYING VALUE AND ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF OUR LONG-TERM DEBT, INCLUDING CONVERTIBLE DEBT, WERE

$11.9 BILLION AND $12.1 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY. THIS IS COMPARED TO A CARRYING VALUE AND ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF $4.9 BILLION AND $5.2 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY, AS OF JUNE 30, 2010. THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE IS BASED ON QUOTED PRICES FOR OUR

PUBLICLY-TRADED DEBT AS OF JUNE 30, 2011 AND 2010, AS APPLICABLE.

CONVERTIBLE DEBT

IN JUNE 2010, WE ISSUED $1.25 BILLION OF ZERO COUPON CONVERTIBLE UNSECURED DEBT DUE ON JUNE 15, 2013 IN A PRIVATE PLACEMENT OFFERING. PROCEEDS FROM THE OFFERING WERE $1.24 BILLION, NET OF FEES AND EXPENSES,

WHICH WERE CAPITALIZED. EACH $1,000 PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF NOTES IS CONVERTIBLE INTO 29.94 SHARES OF MICROSOFT COMMON STOCK AT A CONVERSION PRICE OF $33.40 PER SHARE. AS OF JUNE 30, 2011, THE NET CARRYING AMOUNT OF OUR CONVERTIBLE DEBT WAS $1.2

BILLION AND THE UNAMORTIZED DISCOUNT WAS $38 MILLION.

PRIOR TO MARCH 15, 2013, THE NOTES WILL BE CONVERTIBLE, ONLY IN CERTAIN

CIRCUMSTANCES, INTO CASH AND, IF APPLICABLE, CASH, SHARES OF MICROSOFTS COMMON STOCK, OR A COMBINATION THEREOF, AT OUR ELECTION. ON OR AFTER MARCH 15, 2013, THE NOTES WILL BE CONVERTIBLE AT ANY TIME. UPON CONVERSION, WE WILL PAY CASH UP

TO THE AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF THE NOTES AND PAY OR DELIVER CASH, SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK, OR A COMBINATION OF CASH AND SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK, AT OUR ELECTION.

BECAUSE THE CONVERTIBLE DEBT MAY BE WHOLLY OR PARTIALLY SETTLED IN CASH, WE ARE REQUIRED TO SEPARATELY ACCOUNT FOR THE LIABILITY AND EQUITY COMPONENTS OF THE NOTES IN A MANNER THAT REFLECTS OUR NONCONVERTIBLE DEBT

BORROWING RATE WHEN INTEREST COSTS ARE RECOGNIZED IN SUBSEQUENT PERIODS. THE NET PROCEEDS OF $1.24 BILLION WERE ALLOCATED BETWEEN DEBT FOR $1.18 BILLION AND STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY FOR $58 MILLION WITH THE PORTION IN STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY

REPRESENTING THE FAIR VALUE OF THE OPTION TO CONVERT THE DEBT.

IN CONNECTION WITH THE ISSUANCE OF THE NOTES, WE ENTERED INTO CAPPED

CALL TRANSACTIONS WITH CERTAIN OPTION COUNTERPARTIES WHO ARE INITIAL PURCHASERS OF THE NOTES OR THEIR AFFILIATES. THE CAPPED CALL TRANSACTIONS ARE EXPECTED TO REDUCE POTENTIAL DILUTION OF EARNINGS PER SHARE UPON CONVERSION OF THE NOTES. UNDER THE

CAPPED CALL TRANSACTIONS, WE PURCHASED FROM THE OPTION COUNTERPARTIES CAPPED CALL OPTIONS THAT IN THE AGGREGATE RELATE TO THE TOTAL NUMBER OF SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK UNDERLYING THE NOTES, WITH A STRIKE PRICE EQUAL TO THE CONVERSION PRICE OF THE

NOTES AND WITH A CAP PRICE EQUAL TO $37.16. THE PURCHASED CAPPED CALLS WERE VALUED AT $40 MILLION AND RECORDED TO STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY.

UNEARNED REVENUE

UNEARNED REVENUE AT

JUNE 30, 2011 COMPRISED MAINLY UNEARNED REVENUE FROM VOLUME LICENSING PROGRAMS. UNEARNED REVENUE FROM VOLUME LICENSING PROGRAMS REPRESENTS CUSTOMER BILLINGS FOR MULTI-YEAR LICENSING ARRANGEMENTS PAID FOR EITHER AT INCEPTION OF THE AGREEMENT OR

ANNUALLY AT THE BEGINNING OF EACH BILLING COVERAGE PERIOD AND ACCOUNTED FOR AS SUBSCRIPTIONS WITH REVENUE RECOGNIZED RATABLY OVER THE BILLING COVERAGE PERIOD. UNEARNED REVENUE AT JUNE 30, 2011 ALSO INCLUDED PAYMENTS FOR: POST-DELIVERY SUPPORT

SHARE REPURCHASES

ON SEPTEMBER 22, 2008, WE ANNOUNCED THE COMPLETION OF THE TWO REPURCHASE PROGRAMS APPROVED BY OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL YEAR 2007 (THE 2007 PROGRAMS) TO BUY BACK UP

TO $40.0 BILLION OF MICROSOFT COMMON STOCK. ON SEPTEMBER 22, 2008, WE ALSO ANNOUNCED THAT OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS APPROVED A NEW SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM AUTHORIZING UP TO $40.0 BILLION IN SHARE REPURCHASES WITH AN EXPIRATION DATE OF

OF $276 MILLION (RELATED TO THE ANTITRUST AND UNFAIR COMPETITION CLASS ACTION LAWSUITS) FROM THE AMOUNTS PRESENTED, AS THE AMOUNTS THAT WILL BE SETTLED IN CASH ARE NOT KNOWN AND THE TIMING OF ANY PAYMENTS IS UNCERTAIN. WE HAVE ALSO EXCLUDED UNEARNED

REVENUE OF $1.4 BILLION AND NON-CASH ITEMS OF $279 MILLION.

OTHER PLANNED USES OF CAPITAL

WE WILL CONTINUE TO INVEST IN SALES, MARKETING, PRODUCT SUPPORT INFRASTRUCTURE, AND EXISTING AND ADVANCED AREAS OF TECHNOLOGY. ADDITIONS TO

PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT WILL CONTINUE, INCLUDING NEW FACILITIES, DATA CENTERS, AND COMPUTER SYSTEMS FOR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, SALES AND MARKETING, SUPPORT, AND ADMINISTRATIVE STAFF. WE HAVE OPERATING LEASES FOR MOST U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL SALES

AND SUPPORT OFFICES AND CERTAIN EQUIPMENT. WE HAVE NOT ENGAGED IN ANY RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS OR ARRANGEMENTS WITH UNCONSOLIDATED ENTITIES OR OTHER PERSONS THAT ARE REASONABLY LIKELY TO MATERIALLY AFFECT LIQUIDITY OR THE AVAILABILITY OF CAPITAL

RESOURCES.

DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT WITH SKYPE

ON MAY 10, 2011, WE ANNOUNCED THAT WE HAD ENTERED INTO A DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT WITH SKYPE GLOBAL S.À.R.L. (SKYPE) UNDER WHICH WE WOULD ACQUIRE SKYPE, A LEADING INTERNET COMMUNICATIONS

COMPANY, FOR $8.5 BILLION IN CASH. WE ANTICIPATE THE ACQUISITION WILL EXTEND SKYPES BRAND AND REACH OF ITS NETWORK PLATFORM, WHILE ENHANCING OUR EXISTING PORTFOLIO OF REAL-TIME COMMUNICATIONS PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. THE ACQUISITION IS SUBJECT

TO REGULATORY APPROVALS AND OTHER CUSTOMARY CLOSING CONDITIONS. WE OBTAINED REGULATORY APPROVAL IN THE U.S. AND EXPECT TO OBTAIN ALL REMAINING REQUIRED REGULATORY APPROVALS DURING CALENDAR YEAR 2011.

LIQUIDITY

WE EARN A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF

OUR OPERATING INCOME OUTSIDE THE U.S., WHICH IS DEEMED TO BE PERMANENTLY REINVESTED IN FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS. AS A RESULT, AS DISCUSSED ABOVE UNDER CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS, AND INVESTMENTS, THE MAJORITY OF OUR CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS, AND SHORT-TERM

INVESTMENTS ARE HELD BY FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES. WE CURRENTLY DO NOT INTEND NOR FORESEE A NEED TO REPATRIATE THESE FUNDS. WE EXPECT EXISTING DOMESTIC CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS,

TABLE OF CONTENTS

PART II

ITEM 7

SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS, AND CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS TO CONTINUE TO BE SUFFICIENT TO FUND OUR DOMESTIC OPERATING ACTIVITIES AND CASH COMMITMENTS FOR INVESTING AND FINANCING ACTIVITIES, SUCH AS

REGULAR QUARTERLY DIVIDENDS, DEBT REPAYMENT SCHEDULES, AND MATERIAL CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, FOR AT LEAST THE NEXT 12 MONTHS AND THEREAFTER FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. IN ADDITION, WE EXPECT EXISTING FOREIGN CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS, SHORT-TERM

INVESTMENTS, AND CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS TO CONTINUE TO BE SUFFICIENT TO FUND OUR FOREIGN OPERATING ACTIVITIES AND CASH COMMITMENTS FOR INVESTING ACTIVITIES, SUCH AS MATERIAL CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, FOR AT LEAST THE NEXT 12 MONTHS AND THEREAFTER

FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE.

SHOULD WE REQUIRE MORE CAPITAL IN THE U.S. THAN IS GENERATED BY OUR OPERATIONS DOMESTICALLY, FOR EXAMPLE TO

FUND SIGNIFICANT DISCRETIONARY ACTIVITIES, SUCH AS ACQUISITIONS OF BUSINESSES AND SHARE REPURCHASES, WE COULD ELECT TO REPATRIATE FUTURE EARNINGS FROM FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS OR RAISE CAPITAL IN THE U.S. THROUGH DEBT OR EQUITY ISSUANCES. THESE

ALTERNATIVES COULD RESULT IN HIGHER EFFECTIVE TAX RATES, INCREASED INTEREST EXPENSE, OR OTHER DILUTION OF OUR EARNINGS. WE HAVE BORROWED FUNDS DOMESTICALLY AND CONTINUE TO HAVE THE ABILITY TO BORROW FUNDS DOMESTICALLY AT REASONABLE INTEREST RATES.

AS A RESULT OF THE SPECIAL DIVIDEND PAID IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL YEAR 2005 AND SHARES REPURCHASED, OUR RETAINED DEFICIT,

INCLUDING ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME, WAS $6.3 BILLION AT JUNE 30, 2011. OUR RETAINED DEFICIT IS NOT EXPECTED TO AFFECT OUR FUTURE ABILITY TO OPERATE, PAY DIVIDENDS, OR REPAY OUR DEBT GIVEN OUR CONTINUING PROFITABILITY AND STRONG

FINANCIAL POSITION.

RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

RECENTLY ADOPTED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

ON JULY 1, 2010, WE ADOPTED GUIDANCE ISSUED

BY THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD (FASB) ON REVENUE RECOGNITION. UNDER THE NEW GUIDANCE ON ARRANGEMENTS THAT INCLUDE SOFTWARE ELEMENTS, TANGIBLE PRODUCTS THAT HAVE SOFTWARE COMPONENTS THAT ARE ESSENTIAL TO THE FUNCTIONALITY OF

THE TANGIBLE PRODUCT ARE NO LONGER WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THE SOFTWARE REVENUE RECOGNITION GUIDANCE, AND SOFTWARE-ENABLED PRODUCTS ARE NOW SUBJECT TO OTHER RELEVANT REVENUE RECOGNITION GUIDANCE. ADDITIONALLY, THE FASB ISSUED GUIDANCE ON REVENUE

ARRANGEMENTS WITH MULTIPLE DELIVERABLES THAT ARE OUTSIDE THE SCOPE OF THE SOFTWARE REVENUE RECOGNITION GUIDANCE. UNDER THE NEW GUIDANCE, WHEN VENDOR SPECIFIC OBJECTIVE EVIDENCE OR THIRD PARTY EVIDENCE FOR DELIVERABLES IN AN ARRANGEMENT CANNOT BE

DETERMINED, A BEST ESTIMATE OF THE SELLING PRICE IS REQUIRED TO SEPARATE DELIVERABLES AND ALLOCATE ARRANGEMENT CONSIDERATION USING THE RELATIVE SELLING PRICE METHOD. THE NEW GUIDANCE INCLUDES NEW DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS ON HOW THE APPLICATION OF THE

RELATIVE SELLING PRICE METHOD AFFECTS THE TIMING AND AMOUNT OF REVENUE RECOGNITION. ADOPTION OF THE NEW GUIDANCE DID NOT HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

ON JULY 1, 2010, WE ADOPTED NEW GUIDANCE ISSUED BY THE FASB ON THE CONSOLIDATION OF VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES. THE NEW GUIDANCE REQUIRES REVISED EVALUATIONS OF WHETHER ENTITIES REPRESENT VARIABLE INTEREST

ENTITIES, ONGOING ASSESSMENTS OF CONTROL OVER SUCH ENTITIES, AND ADDITIONAL DISCLOSURES FOR VARIABLE INTERESTS. ADOPTION OF THE NEW GUIDANCE DID NOT HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS NOT YET ADOPTED

IN JUNE 2011, THE FASB ISSUED GUIDANCE ON PRESENTATION OF COMPREHENSIVE INCOME. THE NEW GUIDANCE ELIMINATES THE CURRENT OPTION TO REPORT OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME AND ITS COMPONENTS IN THE STATEMENT OF

CHANGES IN EQUITY. INSTEAD, AN ENTITY WILL BE REQUIRED TO PRESENT EITHER A CONTINUOUS STATEMENT OF NET INCOME AND OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME OR IN TWO SEPARATE BUT CONSECUTIVE STATEMENTS. THE NEW GUIDANCE WILL BE EFFECTIVE FOR US BEGINNING

JULY 1, 2012 AND WILL HAVE PRESENTATION CHANGES ONLY.

IN MAY 2011, THE FASB ISSUED GUIDANCE TO AMEND THE ACCOUNTING AND DISCLOSURE

REQUIREMENTS ON FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS. THE NEW GUIDANCE LIMITS THE HIGHEST-AND-BEST-USE MEASURE TO NONFINANCIAL ASSETS, PERMITS CERTAIN FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES WITH OFFSETTING POSITIONS IN MARKET OR COUNTERPARTY CREDIT RISKS TO BE

MEASURED AT A NET BASIS, AND PROVIDES GUIDANCE ON THE APPLICABILITY OF PREMIUMS AND DISCOUNTS. ADDITIONALLY, THE NEW GUIDANCE

40

TABLE OF CONTENTS

PART II

ITEM 7

EXPANDS THE DISCLOSURES ON LEVEL 3 INPUTS BY REQUIRING QUANTITATIVE DISCLOSURE OF THE UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS AND ASSUMPTIONS, AS WELL AS DESCRIPTION OF THE VALUATION PROCESSES AND THE SENSITIVITY OF

THE FAIR VALUE TO CHANGES IN UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS. THE NEW GUIDANCE WILL BE EFFECTIVE FOR US BEGINNING JANUARY 1, 2012. OTHER THAN REQUIRING ADDITIONAL DISCLOSURES, WE DO NOT ANTICIPATE MATERIAL IMPACTS ON OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS UPON

ADOPTION.

IN JANUARY 2010, THE FASB ISSUED GUIDANCE TO AMEND THE DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS RELATED TO FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS. THE

GUIDANCE REQUIRES THE DISCLOSURE OF ROLL FORWARD ACTIVITIES ON PURCHASES, SALES, ISSUANCE, AND SETTLEMENTS OF THE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES MEASURED USING SIGNIFICANT UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS (LEVEL 3 FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS). THE GUIDANCE WILL BECOME

EFFECTIVE FOR US WITH THE REPORTING PERIOD BEGINNING JULY 1, 2011. OTHER THAN REQUIRING ADDITIONAL DISCLOSURES, THE ADOPTION OF THIS NEW GUIDANCE WILL NOT HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND ACCOMPANYING NOTES ARE PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES (U.S. GAAP). PREPARING FINANCIAL STATEMENTS REQUIRES

MANAGEMENT TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS, LIABILITIES, REVENUE, AND EXPENSES. THESE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS ARE AFFECTED BY MANAGEMENTS APPLICATION OF ACCOUNTING POLICIES. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING

POLICIES FOR US INCLUDE REVENUE RECOGNITION, IMPAIRMENT OF INVESTMENT SECURITIES, GOODWILL, RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS, CONTINGENCIES, INCOME TAXES, AND STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION.

REVENUE RECOGNITION

SOFTWARE REVENUE RECOGNITION REQUIRES JUDGMENT, INCLUDING WHETHER A

SOFTWARE ARRANGEMENT INCLUDES MULTIPLE ELEMENTS, AND IF SO, WHETHER VENDOR-SPECIFIC OBJECTIVE EVIDENCE (VSOE) OF FAIR VALUE EXISTS FOR THOSE ELEMENTS. A PORTION OF REVENUE MAY BE RECORDED AS UNEARNED DUE TO UNDELIVERED ELEMENTS. CHANGES

TO THE ELEMENTS IN A SOFTWARE ARRANGEMENT, THE ABILITY TO IDENTIFY VSOE FOR THOSE ELEMENTS, AND THE FAIR VALUE OF THE RESPECTIVE ELEMENTS COULD MATERIALLY IMPACT THE AMOUNT OF EARNED AND UNEARNED REVENUE. JUDGMENT IS ALSO REQUIRED TO ASSESS WHETHER

FUTURE RELEASES OF CERTAIN SOFTWARE REPRESENT NEW PRODUCTS OR UPGRADES AND ENHANCEMENTS TO EXISTING PRODUCTS.

IMPAIRMENT OF INVESTMENT SECURITIES

INVESTMENTS ARE REVIEWED QUARTERLY FOR INDICATORS OF OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENT. THIS DETERMINATION REQUIRES SIGNIFICANT

JUDGMENT. IN MAKING THIS JUDGMENT, WE EMPLOY A SYSTEMATIC METHODOLOGY QUARTERLY THAT CONSIDERS AVAILABLE QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE EVIDENCE IN EVALUATING POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT OF OUR INVESTMENTS. IF THE COST OF AN INVESTMENT EXCEEDS ITS FAIR

VALUE, WE EVALUATE, AMONG OTHER FACTORS, GENERAL MARKET CONDITIONS, CREDIT QUALITY OF DEBT INSTRUMENT ISSUERS, THE DURATION AND EXTENT TO WHICH THE FAIR VALUE IS LESS THAN COST, AND FOR EQUITY SECURITIES, OUR INTENT AND ABILITY TO HOLD, OR PLANS TO

SELL, THE INVESTMENT. FOR FIXED-INCOME SECURITIES, WE ALSO EVALUATE WHETHER WE HAVE PLANS TO SELL THE SECURITY OR IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT WE WILL BE REQUIRED TO SELL THE SECURITY BEFORE RECOVERY. WE ALSO CONSIDER SPECIFIC ADVERSE CONDITIONS

RELATED TO THE FINANCIAL HEALTH OF AND BUSINESS OUTLOOK FOR THE INVESTEE, INCLUDING INDUSTRY AND SECTOR PERFORMANCE, CHANGES IN TECHNOLOGY, AND OPERATIONAL AND FINANCING CASH FLOW FACTORS. ONCE A DECLINE IN FAIR VALUE IS DETERMINED TO BE

OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY, AN IMPAIRMENT CHARGE IS RECORDED TO OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE) AND A NEW COST BASIS IN THE INVESTMENT IS ESTABLISHED. IF MARKET, INDUSTRY, AND/OR INVESTEE CONDITIONS DETERIORATE, WE MAY INCUR FUTURE IMPAIRMENTS.

GOODWILL

WE ALLOCATE GOODWILL TO REPORTING

UNITS BASED ON THE REPORTING UNIT EXPECTED TO BENEFIT FROM THE BUSINESS COMBINATION. WE EVALUATE OUR REPORTING UNITS ON AN ANNUAL BASIS AND, IF NECESSARY, REASSIGN GOODWILL USING A RELATIVE FAIR VALUE ALLOCATION APPROACH. GOODWILL IS TESTED FOR

IMPAIRMENT AT THE REPORTING UNIT LEVEL (OPERATING SEGMENT OR ONE LEVEL BELOW AN OPERATING SEGMENT) ON AN ANNUAL BASIS (MAY 1 FOR US) AND BETWEEN ANNUAL TESTS IF AN EVENT OCCURS OR CIRCUMSTANCES CHANGE THAT WOULD MORE LIKELY THAN NOT REDUCE THE FAIR

VALUE OF A REPORTING UNIT BELOW ITS CARRYING VALUE. THESE EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES COULD INCLUDE A SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN THE BUSINESS CLIMATE, LEGAL FACTORS, OPERATING PERFORMANCE INDICATORS, COMPETITION, OR SALE OR DISPOSITION OF A SIGNIFICANT

PORTION OF A REPORTING UNIT.

41

TABLE OF CONTENTS

PART II

ITEM 7

APPLICATION OF THE GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT TEST REQUIRES JUDGMENT, INCLUDING THE IDENTIFICATION OF

REPORTING UNITS, ASSIGNMENT OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES TO REPORTING UNITS, ASSIGNMENT OF GOODWILL TO REPORTING UNITS, AND DETERMINATION OF THE FAIR VALUE OF EACH REPORTING UNIT. THE FAIR VALUE OF EACH REPORTING UNIT IS ESTIMATED USING A DISCOUNTED

CASH FLOW METHODOLOGY. THIS ANALYSIS REQUIRES SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENTS, INCLUDING ESTIMATION OF FUTURE CASH FLOWS, WHICH IS DEPENDENT ON INTERNAL FORECASTS, ESTIMATION OF THE LONG-TERM RATE OF GROWTH FOR OUR BUSINESS, ESTIMATION OF THE USEFUL LIFE OVER

WHICH CASH FLOWS WILL OCCUR, AND DETERMINATION OF OUR WEIGHTED AVERAGE COST OF CAPITAL. AMONG OUR REPORTING UNITS, THE FAIR VALUE OF OSD HAS BEEN THE CLOSEST TO ITS CARRYING VALUE. THE CARRYING VALUE OF OSDS GOODWILL WAS $6.4 BILLION AS OF

JUNE 30, 2011.

THE ESTIMATES USED TO CALCULATE THE FAIR VALUE OF A REPORTING UNIT CHANGE FROM YEAR TO YEAR BASED ON OPERATING

RESULTS AND MARKET CONDITIONS. CHANGES IN THESE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS COULD MATERIALLY AFFECT THE DETERMINATION OF FAIR VALUE AND GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT FOR EACH REPORTING UNIT.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS

COSTS INCURRED INTERNALLY IN RESEARCHING AND DEVELOPING A

COMPUTER SOFTWARE PRODUCT ARE CHARGED TO EXPENSE UNTIL TECHNOLOGICAL FEASIBILITY HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED FOR THE PRODUCT. ONCE TECHNOLOGICAL FEASIBILITY IS ESTABLISHED, ALL SOFTWARE COSTS ARE CAPITALIZED UNTIL THE PRODUCT IS AVAILABLE FOR GENERAL

RELEASE TO CUSTOMERS. JUDGMENT IS REQUIRED IN DETERMINING WHEN TECHNOLOGICAL FEASIBILITY OF A PRODUCT IS ESTABLISHED. WE HAVE DETERMINED THAT TECHNOLOGICAL FEASIBILITY FOR OUR SOFTWARE PRODUCTS IS REACHED AFTER ALL HIGH-RISK DEVELOPMENT ISSUES HAVE

BEEN RESOLVED THROUGH CODING AND TESTING. GENERALLY, THIS OCCURS SHORTLY BEFORE THE PRODUCTS ARE RELEASED TO MANUFACTURING. THE AMORTIZATION OF THESE COSTS IS INCLUDED IN COST OF REVENUE OVER THE ESTIMATED LIFE OF THE PRODUCTS.

LEGAL AND OTHER CONTINGENCIES

THE OUTCOMES

OF LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND CLAIMS BROUGHT AGAINST US ARE SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT UNCERTAINTY. AN ESTIMATED LOSS FROM A LOSS CONTINGENCY SUCH AS A LEGAL PROCEEDING OR CLAIM IS ACCRUED BY A CHARGE TO INCOME IF IT IS PROBABLE THAT AN ASSET HAS BEEN

IMPAIRED OR A LIABILITY HAS BEEN INCURRED AND THE AMOUNT OF THE LOSS CAN BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED. DISCLOSURE OF A CONTINGENCY IS REQUIRED IF THERE IS AT LEAST A REASONABLE POSSIBILITY THAT A LOSS HAS BEEN INCURRED. IN DETERMINING WHETHER A LOSS

SHOULD BE ACCRUED WE EVALUATE, AMONG OTHER FACTORS, THE DEGREE OF PROBABILITY OF AN UNFAVORABLE OUTCOME AND THE ABILITY TO MAKE A REASONABLE ESTIMATE OF THE AMOUNT OF LOSS. CHANGES IN THESE FACTORS COULD MATERIALLY IMPACT OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

INCOME TAXES

THE OBJECTIVES OF

ACCOUNTING FOR INCOME TAXES ARE TO RECOGNIZE THE AMOUNT OF TAXES PAYABLE OR REFUNDABLE FOR THE CURRENT YEAR AND DEFERRED TAX LIABILITIES AND ASSETS FOR THE FUTURE TAX CONSEQUENCES OF EVENTS THAT HAVE BEEN RECOGNIZED IN AN ENTITYS FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS OR TAX RETURNS. WE RECOGNIZE THE TAX BENEFIT FROM AN UNCERTAIN TAX POSITION ONLY IF IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT THE TAX POSITION WILL BE SUSTAINED ON EXAMINATION BY THE TAXING AUTHORITIES, BASED ON THE TECHNICAL MERITS OF THE

POSITION. THE TAX BENEFITS RECOGNIZED IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FROM SUCH A POSITION SHOULD BE MEASURED BASED ON THE LARGEST BENEFIT THAT HAS A GREATER THAN 50% LIKELIHOOD OF BEING REALIZED UPON ULTIMATE SETTLEMENT. ACCOUNTING LITERATURE ALSO

PROVIDES GUIDANCE ON DERECOGNITION OF INCOME TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, CLASSIFICATION OF CURRENT AND DEFERRED INCOME TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, ACCOUNTING FOR INTEREST AND PENALTIES ASSOCIATED WITH TAX POSITIONS, AND INCOME TAX DISCLOSURES.

JUDGMENT IS REQUIRED IN ASSESSING THE FUTURE TAX CONSEQUENCES OF EVENTS THAT HAVE BEEN RECOGNIZED IN OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OR TAX RETURNS. VARIATIONS IN THE ACTUAL OUTCOME OF THESE FUTURE TAX CONSEQUENCES COULD MATERIALLY IMPACT OUR FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS.

STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION

STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION COST IS MEASURED AT THE GRANT DATE BASED ON THE FAIR VALUE OF THE AWARD AND IS RECOGNIZED AS EXPENSE OVER THE REQUISITE SERVICE PERIOD. DETERMINING THE FAIR VALUE OF STOCK-BASED AWARDS AT

THE GRANT DATE REQUIRES JUDGMENT, INCLUDING ESTIMATING EXPECTED DIVIDENDS. IN ADDITION, JUDGMENT IS ALSO REQUIRED IN ESTIMATING THE AMOUNT OF STOCK-BASED AWARDS THAT ARE EXPECTED TO BE FORFEITED. IF ACTUAL RESULTS DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THESE

ESTIMATES, STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE AND OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COULD BE IMPACTED.

STATEMENT OF MANAGEMENTS RESPONSIBILITY FOR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

MANAGEMENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE PREPARATION OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND RELATED INFORMATION THAT ARE PRESENTED IN THIS REPORT.

THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, WHICH INCLUDE AMOUNTS BASED ON MANAGEMENTS ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS, HAVE BEEN PREPARED IN CONFORMITY WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.

THE COMPANY DESIGNS AND MAINTAINS ACCOUNTING AND INTERNAL CONTROL SYSTEMS TO PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE AT REASONABLE COST THAT ASSETS ARE

SAFEGUARDED AGAINST LOSS FROM UNAUTHORIZED USE OR DISPOSITION, AND THAT THE FINANCIAL RECORDS ARE RELIABLE FOR PREPARING FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND MAINTAINING ACCOUNTABILITY FOR ASSETS. THESE SYSTEMS ARE AUGMENTED BY WRITTEN POLICIES, AN

ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE PROVIDING DIVISION OF RESPONSIBILITIES, CAREFUL SELECTION AND TRAINING OF QUALIFIED PERSONNEL, AND A PROGRAM OF INTERNAL AUDITS.

THE COMPANY ENGAGED DELOITTE & TOUCHE LLP, AN INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM, TO AUDIT AND RENDER AN OPINION ON THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL

REPORTING IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE STANDARDS OF THE PUBLIC COMPANY ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BOARD (UNITED STATES).

THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS,

THROUGH ITS AUDIT COMMITTEE, CONSISTING SOLELY OF INDEPENDENT DIRECTORS OF THE COMPANY, MEETS PERIODICALLY WITH MANAGEMENT, INTERNAL AUDITORS, AND OUR INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM TO ENSURE THAT EACH IS MEETING ITS RESPONSIBILITIES

AND TO DISCUSS MATTERS CONCERNING INTERNAL CONTROLS AND FINANCIAL REPORTING. DELOITTE & TOUCHE LLP AND THE INTERNAL AUDITORS EACH HAVE FULL AND FREE ACCESS TO THE AUDIT COMMITTEE.

ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT

MARKET RISK

RISKS

WE ARE EXPOSED TO ECONOMIC RISK FROM FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES, INTEREST RATES, CREDIT RISK, EQUITY PRICES, AND COMMODITY PRICES. A PORTION OF THESE RISKS IS HEDGED, BUT THEY MAY IMPACT OUR FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS.

FOREIGN CURRENCY

CERTAIN FORECASTED TRANSACTIONS, ASSETS, AND LIABILITIES ARE EXPOSED TO FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK. WE MONITOR OUR FOREIGN CURRENCY EXPOSURES DAILY AND

USE HEDGES WHERE PRACTICABLE TO OFFSET THE RISKS AND MAXIMIZE THE ECONOMIC EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR FOREIGN CURRENCY POSITIONS. PRINCIPAL CURRENCIES HEDGED INCLUDE THE EURO, JAPANESE YEN, BRITISH POUND, AND CANADIAN DOLLAR.

INTEREST RATE

OUR FIXED-INCOME PORTFOLIO

IS DIVERSIFIED ACROSS CREDIT SECTORS AND MATURITIES, CONSISTING PRIMARILY OF INVESTMENT-GRADE SECURITIES. THE CREDIT RISK AND AVERAGE MATURITY OF THE FIXED-INCOME PORTFOLIO IS MANAGED TO ACHIEVE ECONOMIC RETURNS THAT CORRELATE TO CERTAIN GLOBAL AND

DOMESTIC FIXED-INCOME INDICES. IN ADDITION, WE USE TO BE ANNOUNCED FORWARD PURCHASE COMMITMENTS OF MORTGAGE-BACKED ASSETS TO GAIN EXPOSURE TO AGENCY AND MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES.

EQUITY

OUR EQUITY PORTFOLIO CONSISTS OF

GLOBAL, DEVELOPED, AND EMERGING MARKET SECURITIES THAT ARE SUBJECT TO MARKET PRICE RISK. WE MANAGE THE SECURITIES RELATIVE TO CERTAIN GLOBAL AND DOMESTIC INDICES AND EXPECT THEIR ECONOMIC RISK AND RETURN TO CORRELATE WITH THESE INDICES.

COMMODITY

WE USE BROAD-BASED

COMMODITY EXPOSURES TO ENHANCE PORTFOLIO RETURNS AND FACILITATE PORTFOLIO DIVERSIFICATION. OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO HAS EXPOSURE TO A VARIETY OF COMMODITIES, INCLUDING PRECIOUS METALS, ENERGY, AND GRAIN. WE MANAGE THESE EXPOSURES RELATIVE TO GLOBAL

COMMODITY INDICES AND EXPECT THEIR ECONOMIC RISK AND RETURN TO CORRELATE WITH THESE INDICES.

VALUE-AT-RISK

WE USE A VALUE-AT-RISK (VAR) MODEL TO ESTIMATE AND QUANTIFY OUR MARKET RISKS. VAR IS THE EXPECTED LOSS, FOR A GIVEN CONFIDENCE LEVEL,

IN THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR PORTFOLIO DUE TO ADVERSE MARKET MOVEMENTS OVER A DEFINED TIME HORIZON. THE VAR MODEL IS NOT INTENDED TO REPRESENT ACTUAL LOSSES IN FAIR VALUE, INCLUDING DETERMINATIONS OF OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY LOSSES IN FAIR VALUE IN

ACCORDANCE WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES (U.S. GAAP), BUT IS USED AS A RISK ESTIMATION AND MANAGEMENT TOOL. THE DISTRIBUTION OF THE POTENTIAL CHANGES IN TOTAL MARKET VALUE OF ALL HOLDINGS IS COMPUTED

BASED ON THE HISTORICAL VOLATILITIES AND CORRELATIONS AMONG FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES, INTEREST RATES, EQUITY PRICES, AND COMMODITY PRICES, ASSUMING NORMAL MARKET CONDITIONS.

THE VAR IS CALCULATED AS THE TOTAL LOSS THAT WILL NOT BE EXCEEDED AT THE 97.5 PERCENTILE CONFIDENCE LEVEL OR, ALTERNATIVELY STATED, THE LOSSES

COULD EXCEED THE VAR IN 25 OUT OF 1,000 CASES. SEVERAL RISK FACTORS ARE NOT CAPTURED IN THE MODEL, INCLUDING LIQUIDITY RISK, OPERATIONAL RISK, AND LEGAL RISK.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 1  ACCOUNTING POLICIES

ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES

THE FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS AND ACCOMPANYING NOTES ARE PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA (U.S. GAAP).

PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION

THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDE THE ACCOUNTS OF MICROSOFT

CORPORATION AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES. INTERCOMPANY TRANSACTIONS AND BALANCES HAVE BEEN ELIMINATED. EQUITY INVESTMENTS THROUGH WHICH WE EXERCISE SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE OVER BUT DO NOT CONTROL THE INVESTEE AND ARE NOT THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY OF THE

INVESTEES ACTIVITIES ARE ACCOUNTED FOR USING THE EQUITY METHOD. INVESTMENTS THROUGH WHICH WE ARE NOT ABLE TO EXERCISE SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE OVER THE INVESTEE AND WHICH DO NOT HAVE READILY DETERMINABLE FAIR VALUES ARE ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER THE

COST METHOD.

ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS

PREPARING FINANCIAL STATEMENTS REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS, LIABILITIES, REVENUE, AND EXPENSES. EXAMPLES INCLUDE: ESTIMATES OF LOSS

CONTINGENCIES, PRODUCT WARRANTIES, PRODUCT LIFE CYCLES, PRODUCT RETURNS, AND STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION FORFEITURE RATES; ASSUMPTIONS SUCH AS THE ELEMENTS COMPRISING A SOFTWARE ARRANGEMENT, INCLUDING THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN UPGRADES/ENHANCEMENTS AND

NEW PRODUCTS; WHEN TECHNOLOGICAL FEASIBILITY IS ACHIEVED FOR OUR PRODUCTS; THE POTENTIAL OUTCOME OF FUTURE TAX CONSEQUENCES OF EVENTS THAT HAVE BEEN RECOGNIZED IN OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OR TAX RETURNS; ESTIMATING THE FAIR VALUE AND/OR GOODWILL

IMPAIRMENT FOR OUR REPORTING UNITS; AND DETERMINING WHEN INVESTMENT IMPAIRMENTS ARE OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY. ACTUAL RESULTS AND OUTCOMES MAY DIFFER FROM MANAGEMENTS ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS.

FOREIGN CURRENCIES

ASSETS AND LIABILITIES

RECORDED IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES ARE TRANSLATED AT THE EXCHANGE RATE ON THE BALANCE SHEET DATE. REVENUE AND EXPENSES ARE TRANSLATED AT AVERAGE RATES OF EXCHANGE PREVAILING DURING THE YEAR. TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENTS RESULTING FROM THIS PROCESS ARE

RECORDED TO OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (OCI).

REVENUE RECOGNITION

REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED WHEN PERSUASIVE EVIDENCE OF AN ARRANGEMENT EXISTS, DELIVERY HAS OCCURRED, THE FEE IS FIXED OR DETERMINABLE, AND

COLLECTIBILITY IS PROBABLE. REVENUE GENERALLY IS RECOGNIZED NET OF ANY TAXES COLLECTED FROM CUSTOMERS AND SUBSEQUENTLY REMITTED TO GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORITIES.

REVENUE FOR RETAIL PACKAGED PRODUCTS, PRODUCTS LICENSED TO ORIGINAL EQUIPMENT MANUFACTURERS (OEMS), AND PERPETUAL LICENSES UNDER CERTAIN VOLUME LICENSING PROGRAMS GENERALLY IS RECOGNIZED AS PRODUCTS ARE

SHIPPED OR MADE AVAILABLE. REVENUE FOR PRODUCTS UNDER TECHNOLOGY GUARANTEE PROGRAMS, WHICH PROVIDE FREE OR SIGNIFICANTLY DISCOUNTED RIGHTS TO USE UPCOMING NEW VERSIONS OF A SOFTWARE PRODUCT IF AN END USER LICENSES EXISTING VERSIONS OF THE PRODUCT

DURING THE ELIGIBILITY PERIOD, IS ALLOCATED BETWEEN EXISTING PRODUCT AND THE NEW PRODUCT, AND REVENUE ALLOCATED TO THE NEW PRODUCT IS DEFERRED UNTIL THAT VERSION IS DELIVERED. THE REVENUE ALLOCATION IS BASED ON VENDOR-SPECIFIC OBJECTIVE EVIDENCE OF

FAIR VALUE OF THE PRODUCTS.

CERTAIN MULTI-YEAR LICENSING ARRANGEMENTS INCLUDE A PERPETUAL LICENSE FOR CURRENT PRODUCTS COMBINED WITH

RIGHTS TO RECEIVE FUTURE VERSIONS OF SOFTWARE PRODUCTS ON A WHEN-AND-IF-AVAILABLE BASIS (SOFTWARE ASSURANCE) AND ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AS SUBSCRIPTIONS, WITH BILLINGS RECORDED AS UNEARNED REVENUE AND RECOGNIZED AS REVENUE RATABLY OVER THE

BILLING COVERAGE PERIOD. REVENUE FROM CERTAIN ARRANGEMENTS THAT ALLOW FOR THE USE OF A PRODUCT OR SERVICE OVER A

50

TABLE OF CONTENTS

PART II

ITEM 8

PERIOD OF TIME WITHOUT TAKING POSSESSION OF SOFTWARE ARE ALSO ACCOUNTED FOR AS SUBSCRIPTIONS. REVENUE FOR SOFTWARE PRODUCTS WHERE CUSTOMERS HAVE THE RIGHT TO RECEIVE UNSPECIFIED

UPGRADES/ENHANCEMENTS ON A WHEN-AND-IF-AVAILABLE BASIS AND FOR WHICH VENDOR-SPECIFIC OBJECTIVE EVIDENCE OF FAIR VALUE DOES NOT EXIST FOR THE UPGRADES/ENHANCEMENTS IS RECOGNIZED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THE ESTIMATED LIFE OF THE SOFTWARE.

REVENUE RELATED TO OUR XBOX 360 GAMING AND ENTERTAINMENT CONSOLE, KINECT FOR XBOX 360, GAMES PUBLISHED BY US, AND OTHER HARDWARE

COMPONENTS IS GENERALLY RECOGNIZED WHEN OWNERSHIP IS TRANSFERRED TO THE RESELLERS. REVENUE RELATED TO GAMES PUBLISHED BY THIRD PARTIES FOR USE ON THE XBOX 360 PLATFORM IS RECOGNIZED WHEN GAMES ARE MANUFACTURED BY THE GAME PUBLISHERS.

DISPLAY ADVERTISING REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED AS ADVERTISEMENTS ARE DISPLAYED. SEARCH ADVERTISING REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED WHEN THE AD APPEARS IN THE

SEARCH RESULTS OR WHEN THE ACTION NECESSARY TO EARN THE REVENUE HAS BEEN COMPLETED. CONSULTING SERVICES REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED AS SERVICES ARE RENDERED, GENERALLY BASED ON THE NEGOTIATED HOURLY RATE IN THE CONSULTING ARRANGEMENT AND THE NUMBER OF

HOURS WORKED DURING THE PERIOD. CONSULTING REVENUE FOR FIXED-PRICE SERVICES ARRANGEMENTS IS RECOGNIZED AS SERVICES ARE PROVIDED. REVENUE FROM PREPAID POINTS REDEEMABLE FOR THE PURCHASE OF SOFTWARE OR SERVICES IS RECOGNIZED UPON REDEMPTION OF THE

POINTS AND DELIVERY OF THE SOFTWARE OR SERVICES.

COST OF REVENUE

COST OF REVENUE INCLUDES; MANUFACTURING AND DISTRIBUTION COSTS FOR PRODUCTS SOLD AND PROGRAMS LICENSED; OPERATING COSTS RELATED TO PRODUCT SUPPORT SERVICE CENTERS AND PRODUCT DISTRIBUTION CENTERS; COSTS INCURRED TO

INCLUDE SOFTWARE ON PCS SOLD BY OEMS, TO DRIVE TRAFFIC TO OUR WEB SITES, AND TO ACQUIRE ONLINE ADVERTISING SPACE (TRAFFIC ACQUISITION COSTS); COSTS INCURRED TO SUPPORT AND MAINTAIN INTERNET-BASED PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, INCLUDING

ROYALTIES; WARRANTY COSTS; INVENTORY VALUATION ADJUSTMENTS; COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE DELIVERY OF CONSULTING SERVICES; AND THE AMORTIZATION OF CAPITALIZED RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS. CAPITALIZED RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS ARE AMORTIZED OVER

THE ESTIMATED LIVES OF THE PRODUCTS.

PRODUCT WARRANTY

WE PROVIDE FOR THE ESTIMATED COSTS OF FULFILLING OUR OBLIGATIONS UNDER HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE WARRANTIES AT THE TIME THE RELATED REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED. FOR HARDWARE WARRANTIES, WE ESTIMATE THE COSTS BASED ON

HISTORICAL AND PROJECTED PRODUCT FAILURE RATES, HISTORICAL AND PROJECTED REPAIR COSTS, AND KNOWLEDGE OF SPECIFIC PRODUCT FAILURES (IF ANY). THE SPECIFIC HARDWARE WARRANTY TERMS AND CONDITIONS VARY DEPENDING UPON THE PRODUCT SOLD AND THE COUNTRY IN

WHICH WE DO BUSINESS, BUT GENERALLY INCLUDE PARTS AND LABOR OVER A PERIOD GENERALLY RANGING FROM 90 DAYS TO THREE YEARS. FOR SOFTWARE WARRANTIES, WE ESTIMATE THE COSTS TO PROVIDE BUG FIXES, SUCH AS SECURITY PATCHES, OVER THE ESTIMATED LIFE OF

THE SOFTWARE. WE REGULARLY REEVALUATE OUR ESTIMATES TO ASSESS THE ADEQUACY OF THE RECORDED WARRANTY LIABILITIES AND ADJUST THE AMOUNTS AS NECESSARY.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

RESEARCH AND

DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES INCLUDE PAYROLL, EMPLOYEE BENEFITS, STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE, AND OTHER HEADCOUNT-RELATED EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT. RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES ALSO INCLUDE THIRD-PARTY DEVELOPMENT AND

PROGRAMMING COSTS, LOCALIZATION COSTS INCURRED TO TRANSLATE SOFTWARE FOR INTERNATIONAL MARKETS, AND THE AMORTIZATION OF PURCHASED SOFTWARE CODE AND SERVICES CONTENT. SUCH COSTS RELATED TO SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT ARE INCLUDED IN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

EXPENSE UNTIL THE POINT THAT TECHNOLOGICAL FEASIBILITY IS REACHED, WHICH FOR OUR SOFTWARE PRODUCTS, IS GENERALLY SHORTLY BEFORE THE PRODUCTS ARE RELEASED TO MANUFACTURING. ONCE TECHNOLOGICAL FEASIBILITY IS REACHED, SUCH COSTS ARE CAPITALIZED AND

AMORTIZED TO COST OF REVENUE OVER THE ESTIMATED LIVES OF THE PRODUCTS.

SALES AND MARKETING

SALES AND MARKETING EXPENSES INCLUDE PAYROLL, EMPLOYEE BENEFITS, STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE, AND OTHER HEADCOUNT-RELATED EXPENSES ASSOCIATED

WITH SALES AND MARKETING PERSONNEL, AND THE COSTS OF ADVERTISING, PROMOTIONS, TRADE SHOWS, SEMINARS, AND OTHER PROGRAMS. ADVERTISING COSTS ARE EXPENSED AS INCURRED. ADVERTISING EXPENSE WAS $1.9 BILLION, $1.6 BILLION, AND $1.4 BILLION IN FISCAL YEARS

2011, 2010, AND 2009, RESPECTIVELY.

51

TABLE OF CONTENTS

PART II

ITEM 8

EMPLOYEE SEVERANCE

WE RECORD EMPLOYEE SEVERANCE WHEN A SPECIFIC PLAN HAS BEEN APPROVED BY MANAGEMENT, THE PLAN HAS BEEN COMMUNICATED TO EMPLOYEES, AND IT IS UNLIKELY THAT SIGNIFICANT CHANGES WILL BE MADE TO THE PLAN. IN JANUARY 2009,

WE ANNOUNCED AND IMPLEMENTED A RESOURCE MANAGEMENT PROGRAM TO REDUCE DISCRETIONARY OPERATING EXPENSES, EMPLOYEE HEADCOUNT, AND CAPITAL EXPENDITURES. SEVERANCE EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH THIS PROGRAM WERE $59 MILLION AND $330 MILLION IN FISCAL YEARS

2010 AND 2009, RESPECTIVELY, AND ARE INCLUDED IN GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES.

STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION

WE MEASURE STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION COST AT THE GRANT DATE BASED ON THE FAIR VALUE OF THE AWARD AND RECOGNIZE IT AS EXPENSE OVER THE VESTING OR

SERVICE PERIOD, AS APPLICABLE, OF THE STOCK AWARD (GENERALLY FOUR TO FIVE YEARS) USING THE STRAIGHT-LINE METHOD.

EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN

SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK MAY BE PURCHASED BY EMPLOYEES AT THREE-MONTH INTERVALS AT 90% OF THE FAIR MARKET VALUE OF THE STOCK ON

THE LAST DAY OF EACH THREE-MONTH PERIOD. COMPENSATION EXPENSE FOR THE EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN IS MEASURED AS THE DISCOUNT THE EMPLOYEE IS ENTITLED TO UPON PURCHASE AND IS RECOGNIZED IN THE PERIOD OF PURCHASE.

INCOME TAXES

INCOME TAX EXPENSE INCLUDES

U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL INCOME TAXES, THE PROVISION FOR U.S. TAXES ON UNDISTRIBUTED EARNINGS OF INTERNATIONAL SUBSIDIARIES NOT DEEMED TO BE PERMANENTLY INVESTED, AND INTEREST AND PENALTIES ON UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS. CERTAIN INCOME AND EXPENSES ARE

NOT REPORTED IN TAX RETURNS AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN THE SAME YEAR. THE TAX EFFECT OF SUCH TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES IS REPORTED AS DEFERRED INCOME TAXES. THE DEFERRED INCOME TAXES ARE CLASSIFIED AS CURRENT OR LONG-TERM BASED ON THE CLASSIFICATION OF

THE RELATED ASSET OR LIABILITY.

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

WE ACCOUNT FOR CERTAIN ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AT FAIR VALUE. THE HIERARCHY BELOW LISTS THREE LEVELS OF FAIR VALUE BASED ON THE EXTENT TO WHICH INPUTS USED IN MEASURING FAIR VALUE ARE OBSERVABLE IN THE

MARKET. WE CATEGORIZE EACH OF OUR FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS IN ONE OF THESE THREE LEVELS BASED ON THE LOWEST LEVEL INPUT THAT IS SIGNIFICANT TO THE FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT IN ITS ENTIRETY. THESE LEVELS ARE.



LEVEL 1

 INPUTS ARE BASED UPON UNADJUSTED QUOTED PRICES FOR IDENTICAL INSTRUMENTS TRADED IN ACTIVE MARKETS. OUR LEVEL 1 NON-DERIVATIVE

INVESTMENTS PRIMARILY INCLUDE U.S. TREASURIES, DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL EQUITIES, AND ACTIVELY TRADED MUTUAL FUNDS. OUR LEVEL 1 DERIVATIVE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES INCLUDE THOSE ACTIVELY TRADED ON EXCHANGES.



LEVEL 2

 INPUTS ARE BASED UPON QUOTED PRICES FOR SIMILAR INSTRUMENTS IN ACTIVE MARKETS, QUOTED PRICES FOR IDENTICAL OR SIMILAR INSTRUMENTS IN

MARKETS THAT ARE NOT ACTIVE, AND MODEL-BASED VALUATION TECHNIQUES (E.G. THE BLACK-SCHOLES MODEL) FOR WHICH ALL SIGNIFICANT INPUTS ARE OBSERVABLE IN THE MARKET OR CAN BE CORROBORATED BY OBSERVABLE MARKET DATA FOR SUBSTANTIALLY THE FULL TERM OF THE

ASSETS OR LIABILITIES. WHERE APPLICABLE, THESE MODELS PROJECT FUTURE CASH FLOWS AND DISCOUNT THE FUTURE AMOUNTS TO A PRESENT VALUE USING MARKET-BASED OBSERVABLE INPUTS INCLUDING INTEREST RATE CURVES, FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES, AND FORWARD AND SPOT

PRICES FOR CURRENCIES AND COMMODITIES. OUR LEVEL 2 NON-DERIVATIVE INVESTMENTS CONSIST PRIMARILY OF CORPORATE NOTES AND BONDS, MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES, AGENCY SECURITIES, CERTIFICATES OF DEPOSIT, AND COMMERCIAL PAPER. OUR LEVEL 2 DERIVATIVE ASSETS

AND LIABILITIES PRIMARILY INCLUDE CERTAIN OVER-THE-COUNTER OPTION AND SWAP CONTRACTS.

52

TABLE OF CONTENTS

PART II

ITEM 8



LEVEL 3

 INPUTS ARE GENERALLY UNOBSERVABLE AND TYPICALLY REFLECT MANAGEMENTS ESTIMATES OF ASSUMPTIONS THAT MARKET PARTICIPANTS WOULD USE IN

PRICING THE ASSET OR LIABILITY. THE FAIR VALUES ARE THEREFORE DETERMINED USING MODEL-BASED TECHNIQUES, INCLUDING OPTION PRICING MODELS AND DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW MODELS. OUR LEVEL 3 NON-DERIVATIVE ASSETS PRIMARILY COMPRISE INVESTMENTS IN CERTAIN

CORPORATE BONDS. WE VALUE THESE CORPORATE BONDS USING INTERNALLY DEVELOPED VALUATION MODELS, INPUTS TO WHICH INCLUDE INTEREST RATE CURVES, CREDIT SPREADS, STOCK PRICES, AND VOLATILITIES. UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS USED IN THESE MODELS ARE SIGNIFICANT

TO THE FAIR VALUES OF THE INVESTMENTS. OUR LEVEL 3 DERIVATIVE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES PRIMARILY COMPRISE DERIVATIVES FOR FOREIGN EQUITIES. IN CERTAIN CASES, MARKET-BASED OBSERVABLE INPUTS ARE NOT AVAILABLE AND WE USE MANAGEMENT JUDGMENT TO DEVELOP

ASSUMPTIONS TO DETERMINE FAIR VALUE FOR THESE DERIVATIVES.

WE MEASURE CERTAIN ASSETS, INCLUDING OUR COST AND EQUITY

METHOD INVESTMENTS, AT FAIR VALUE ON A NONRECURRING BASIS WHEN THEY ARE DEEMED TO BE OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARILY IMPAIRED. THE FAIR VALUES OF THESE INVESTMENTS ARE DETERMINED BASED ON VALUATION TECHNIQUES USING THE BEST INFORMATION AVAILABLE, AND MAY

INCLUDE QUOTED MARKET PRICES, MARKET COMPARABLES, AND DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW PROJECTIONS. AN IMPAIRMENT CHARGE IS RECORDED WHEN THE COST OF THE INVESTMENT EXCEEDS ITS FAIR VALUE AND THIS CONDITION IS DETERMINED TO BE OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY.

OUR CURRENT FINANCIAL LIABILITIES HAVE FAIR VALUES THAT APPROXIMATE THEIR CARRYING VALUES. OUR LONG-TERM FINANCIAL LIABILITIES CONSIST OF LONG-TERM

DEBT WHICH IS RECORDED ON THE BALANCE SHEET AT ISSUANCE PRICE LESS UNAMORTIZED DISCOUNT.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

WE CONSIDER ALL HIGHLY LIQUID INTEREST-EARNING INVESTMENTS WITH A MATURITY OF THREE MONTHS OR LESS AT THE DATE OF PURCHASE TO BE CASH EQUIVALENTS.

THE FAIR VALUES OF THESE INVESTMENTS APPROXIMATE THEIR CARRYING VALUES. IN GENERAL, INVESTMENTS WITH ORIGINAL MATURITIES OF GREATER THAN THREE MONTHS AND REMAINING MATURITIES OF LESS THAN ONE YEAR ARE CLASSIFIED AS SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS.

INVESTMENTS WITH MATURITIES BEYOND ONE YEAR MAY BE CLASSIFIED AS SHORT-TERM BASED ON THEIR HIGHLY LIQUID NATURE AND BECAUSE SUCH MARKETABLE SECURITIES REPRESENT THE INVESTMENT OF CASH THAT IS AVAILABLE FOR CURRENT OPERATIONS. ALL CASH EQUIVALENTS

AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS ARE CLASSIFIED AS AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE AND REALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES ARE RECORDED USING THE SPECIFIC IDENTIFICATION METHOD. CHANGES IN MARKET VALUE, EXCLUDING OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENTS, ARE REFLECTED IN OCI.

EQUITY AND OTHER INVESTMENTS CLASSIFIED AS LONG-TERM INCLUDE BOTH DEBT AND EQUITY INSTRUMENTS. DEBT AND PUBLICLY-TRADED EQUITY

SECURITIES ARE CLASSIFIED AS AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE AND REALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES ARE RECORDED USING THE SPECIFIC IDENTIFICATION METHOD. CHANGES IN MARKET VALUE, EXCLUDING OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENTS, ARE REFLECTED IN OCI. COMMON AND PREFERRED

STOCK AND OTHER INVESTMENTS THAT ARE RESTRICTED FOR MORE THAN ONE YEAR OR ARE NOT PUBLICLY TRADED ARE RECORDED AT COST OR USING THE EQUITY METHOD.

WE LEND CERTAIN FIXED-INCOME AND EQUITY SECURITIES TO INCREASE INVESTMENT RETURNS. THE LOANED SECURITIES CONTINUE TO BE CARRIED AS INVESTMENTS ON OUR BALANCE SHEET. CASH AND/OR SECURITY INTERESTS ARE RECEIVED AS

COLLATERAL FOR THE LOAN SECURITIES WITH THE AMOUNT DETERMINED BASED UPON THE UNDERLYING SECURITY LENT AND THE CREDITWORTHINESS OF THE BORROWER. CASH RECEIVED IS RECORDED AS AN ASSET WITH A CORRESPONDING LIABILITY.

INVESTMENTS ARE CONSIDERED TO BE IMPAIRED WHEN A DECLINE IN FAIR VALUE IS JUDGED TO BE OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY. FAIR VALUE IS CALCULATED BASED ON

PUBLICLY AVAILABLE MARKET INFORMATION OR OTHER ESTIMATES DETERMINED BY MANAGEMENT. WE EMPLOY A SYSTEMATIC METHODOLOGY ON A QUARTERLY BASIS THAT CONSIDERS AVAILABLE QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE EVIDENCE IN EVALUATING POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT OF OUR

INVESTMENTS. IF THE COST OF AN INVESTMENT EXCEEDS ITS FAIR VALUE, WE EVALUATE, AMONG OTHER FACTORS, GENERAL MARKET CONDITIONS, CREDIT QUALITY OF DEBT INSTRUMENT ISSUERS, THE DURATION AND EXTENT TO WHICH THE FAIR VALUE IS LESS THAN COST, AND FOR

EQUITY SECURITIES, OUR INTENT AND ABILITY TO HOLD, OR PLANS TO SELL, THE INVESTMENT. FOR FIXED-INCOME SECURITIES, WE ALSO EVALUATE WHETHER WE HAVE PLANS TO SELL THE SECURITY OR IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT WE WILL BE REQUIRED TO SELL THE SECURITY

BEFORE RECOVERY. WE ALSO CONSIDER SPECIFIC ADVERSE CONDITIONS RELATED TO THE FINANCIAL HEALTH OF AND BUSINESS OUTLOOK FOR THE INVESTEE, INCLUDING INDUSTRY AND SECTOR PERFORMANCE, CHANGES IN TECHNOLOGY, AND OPERATIONAL AND FINANCING CASH FLOW

FACTORS. ONCE A DECLINE IN FAIR VALUE IS DETERMINED TO BE OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY, AN IMPAIRMENT CHARGE IS RECORDED TO OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE) AND A NEW COST BASIS IN THE INVESTMENT IS ESTABLISHED.

53

TABLE OF CONTENTS

PART II

ITEM 8

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS ARE RECOGNIZED AS EITHER ASSETS OR LIABILITIES AND ARE MEASURED AT FAIR

VALUE. THE ACCOUNTING FOR CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF A DERIVATIVE DEPENDS ON THE INTENDED USE OF THE DERIVATIVE AND THE RESULTING DESIGNATION.

FOR A DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENT DESIGNATED AS A FAIR-VALUE HEDGE, THE GAIN (LOSS) IS RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS IN THE PERIOD OF CHANGE TOGETHER WITH THE OFFSETTING LOSS OR GAIN ON THE HEDGED ITEM ATTRIBUTED TO THE RISK

BEING HEDGED. FOR OPTIONS DESIGNATED AS FAIR-VALUE HEDGES, CHANGES IN THE TIME VALUE ARE EXCLUDED FROM THE ASSESSMENT OF HEDGE EFFECTIVENESS AND ARE RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS.

FOR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS DESIGNATED AS CASH-FLOW HEDGES, THE EFFECTIVE PORTION OF THE DERIVATIVES GAIN (LOSS) IS INITIALLY REPORTED AS A COMPONENT OF OCI AND IS SUBSEQUENTLY RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS WHEN THE

HEDGED EXPOSURE IS RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS. FOR OPTIONS DESIGNATED AS CASH-FLOW HEDGES, CHANGES IN THE TIME VALUE ARE EXCLUDED FROM THE ASSESSMENT OF HEDGE EFFECTIVENESS AND ARE RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS. GAINS (LOSSES) ON DERIVATIVES REPRESENTING

EITHER HEDGE COMPONENTS EXCLUDED FROM THE ASSESSMENT OF EFFECTIVENESS OR HEDGE INEFFECTIVENESS ARE RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS.

FOR

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS THAT ARE NOT DESIGNATED AS HEDGES, GAINS (LOSSES) FROM CHANGES IN FAIR VALUES ARE PRIMARILY RECOGNIZED IN OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE). OTHER THAN THOSE DERIVATIVES ENTERED INTO FOR INVESTMENT PURPOSES, SUCH AS COMMODITY CONTRACTS,

THE GAINS (LOSSES) ARE GENERALLY ECONOMICALLY OFFSET BY UNREALIZED GAINS (LOSSES) IN THE UNDERLYING AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE SECURITIES, WHICH ARE RECORDED AS A COMPONENT OF OCI UNTIL THE SECURITIES ARE SOLD OR OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARILY IMPAIRED, AT WHICH

TIME THE AMOUNTS ARE MOVED FROM OCI INTO OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE).

ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS

THE ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS REFLECTS OUR BEST ESTIMATE OF PROBABLE LOSSES INHERENT IN THE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE BALANCE. WE DETERMINE THE

ALLOWANCE BASED ON KNOWN TROUBLED ACCOUNTS, HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE, AND OTHER CURRENTLY AVAILABLE EVIDENCE. ACTIVITY IN THE ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS WAS AS FOLLOWS.

INVENTORIES

INVENTORIES ARE STATED AT THE LOWER OF COST OR MARKET, USING THE AVERAGE COST METHOD. COST INCLUDES MATERIALS, LABOR, AND MANUFACTURING OVERHEAD

RELATED TO THE PURCHASE AND PRODUCTION OF INVENTORIES. WE REGULARLY REVIEW INVENTORY QUANTITIES ON HAND, FUTURE PURCHASE COMMITMENTS WITH OUR SUPPLIERS, AND THE ESTIMATED UTILITY OF OUR INVENTORY. IF OUR REVIEW INDICATES A REDUCTION IN UTILITY BELOW

GOODWILL

GOODWILL IS TESTED FOR IMPAIRMENT AT THE REPORTING UNIT LEVEL (OPERATING SEGMENT OR ONE LEVEL BELOW AN OPERATING SEGMENT) ON AN ANNUAL BASIS (MAY 1 FOR US) AND BETWEEN ANNUAL TESTS IF AN EVENT OCCURS OR

CIRCUMSTANCES CHANGE THAT WOULD MORE LIKELY THAN NOT REDUCE THE FAIR VALUE OF A REPORTING UNIT BELOW ITS CARRYING VALUE.

INTANGIBLE ASSETS

ALL OF OUR INTANGIBLE ASSETS ARE SUBJECT TO AMORTIZATION AND ARE AMORTIZED USING THE STRAIGHT-LINE METHOD OVER THEIR ESTIMATED

PERIOD OF BENEFIT, RANGING FROM ONE TO 10 YEARS. WE EVALUATE THE RECOVERABILITY OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS PERIODICALLY BY TAKING INTO ACCOUNT EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES THAT MAY WARRANT REVISED ESTIMATES OF USEFUL LIVES OR THAT INDICATE THE ASSET MAY BE

IMPAIRED.

RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

RECENTLY ADOPTED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

ON JULY 1, 2010, WE ADOPTED GUIDANCE ISSUED BY THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD (FASB) ON REVENUE RECOGNITION. UNDER THE

NEW GUIDANCE ON ARRANGEMENTS THAT INCLUDE SOFTWARE ELEMENTS, TANGIBLE PRODUCTS THAT HAVE SOFTWARE COMPONENTS THAT ARE ESSENTIAL TO THE FUNCTIONALITY OF THE TANGIBLE PRODUCT ARE NO LONGER WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THE SOFTWARE REVENUE RECOGNITION GUIDANCE,

AND SOFTWARE-ENABLED PRODUCTS ARE NOW SUBJECT TO OTHER RELEVANT REVENUE RECOGNITION GUIDANCE. ADDITIONALLY, THE FASB ISSUED GUIDANCE ON REVENUE ARRANGEMENTS WITH MULTIPLE DELIVERABLES THAT ARE OUTSIDE THE SCOPE OF THE SOFTWARE REVENUE RECOGNITION

GUIDANCE. UNDER THE NEW GUIDANCE, WHEN VENDOR SPECIFIC OBJECTIVE EVIDENCE OR THIRD PARTY EVIDENCE FOR DELIVERABLES IN AN ARRANGEMENT CANNOT BE DETERMINED, A BEST ESTIMATE OF THE SELLING PRICE IS REQUIRED TO SEPARATE DELIVERABLES AND ALLOCATE

ARRANGEMENT CONSIDERATION USING THE RELATIVE SELLING PRICE METHOD. THE NEW GUIDANCE INCLUDES NEW DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS ON HOW THE APPLICATION OF THE RELATIVE SELLING PRICE METHOD AFFECTS THE TIMING AND AMOUNT OF REVENUE RECOGNITION. ADOPTION OF

THE NEW GUIDANCE DID NOT HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

ON JULY 1, 2010, WE ADOPTED NEW GUIDANCE ISSUED BY

THE FASB ON THE CONSOLIDATION OF VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES. THE NEW GUIDANCE REQUIRES REVISED EVALUATIONS OF WHETHER ENTITIES REPRESENT VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES, ONGOING ASSESSMENTS OF CONTROL OVER SUCH ENTITIES, AND ADDITIONAL DISCLOSURES FOR

VARIABLE INTERESTS. ADOPTION OF THE NEW GUIDANCE DID NOT HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS NOT

YET ADOPTED

IN JUNE 2011, THE FASB ISSUED GUIDANCE ON PRESENTATION OF COMPREHENSIVE INCOME. THE NEW GUIDANCE ELIMINATES THE

CURRENT OPTION TO REPORT OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME AND ITS COMPONENTS IN THE STATEMENT OF CHANGES IN EQUITY. INSTEAD, AN ENTITY WILL BE REQUIRED TO PRESENT EITHER A CONTINUOUS STATEMENT OF NET INCOME AND OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME OR IN TWO

SEPARATE BUT CONSECUTIVE STATEMENTS. THE NEW GUIDANCE WILL BE EFFECTIVE FOR US BEGINNING JULY 1, 2012 AND WILL HAVE PRESENTATION CHANGES ONLY.

IN MAY 2011, THE FASB ISSUED GUIDANCE TO AMEND THE ACCOUNTING AND DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS ON FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS. THE NEW GUIDANCE LIMITS THE HIGHEST-AND-BEST-USE MEASURE TO NONFINANCIAL ASSETS, PERMITS

CERTAIN FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES WITH OFFSETTING POSITIONS IN MARKET OR COUNTERPARTY CREDIT RISKS TO BE MEASURED AT A NET BASIS, AND PROVIDES GUIDANCE ON THE APPLICABILITY OF PREMIUMS AND DISCOUNTS. ADDITIONALLY, THE NEW GUIDANCE

EXPANDS THE DISCLOSURES ON LEVEL 3 INPUTS BY REQUIRING QUANTITATIVE DISCLOSURE OF THE UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS AND ASSUMPTIONS, AS WELL AS DESCRIPTION OF THE VALUATION PROCESSES AND THE SENSITIVITY OF THE FAIR VALUE TO CHANGES IN UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS. THE

NEW GUIDANCE WILL BE EFFECTIVE FOR US BEGINNING JANUARY 1, 2012. OTHER THAN REQUIRING ADDITIONAL DISCLOSURES, WE DO NOT ANTICIPATE MATERIAL IMPACTS ON OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS UPON ADOPTION.

ITEM 8

IN JANUARY 2010, THE FASB ISSUED GUIDANCE TO AMEND THE DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS RELATED TO FAIR

VALUE MEASUREMENTS. THE GUIDANCE REQUIRES THE DISCLOSURE OF ROLL FORWARD ACTIVITIES ON PURCHASES, SALES, ISSUANCE, AND SETTLEMENTS OF THE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES MEASURED USING SIGNIFICANT UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS (LEVEL 3 FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS). THE

GUIDANCE WILL BECOME EFFECTIVE FOR US WITH THE REPORTING PERIOD BEGINNING JULY 1, 2011. OTHER THAN REQUIRING ADDITIONAL DISCLOSURES, THE ADOPTION OF THIS NEW GUIDANCE WILL NOT HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

NOTE 2  EARNINGS PER SHARE

BASIC EARNINGS PER SHARE (EPS) IS COMPUTED BASED ON THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE NUMBER OF SHARES OF COMMON STOCK OUTSTANDING DURING THE PERIOD. DILUTED EPS IS COMPUTED BASED ON THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE NUMBER OF

SHARES OF COMMON STOCK PLUS THE EFFECT OF DILUTIVE POTENTIAL COMMON SHARES OUTSTANDING DURING THE PERIOD USING THE TREASURY STOCK METHOD. DILUTIVE POTENTIAL COMMON SHARES INCLUDE OUTSTANDING STOCK OPTIONS, STOCK AWARDS, AND SHARED PERFORMANCE STOCK

AWARDS. THE COMPONENTS OF BASIC AND DILUTED EPS ARE AS FOLLOWS.

UNREALIZED LOSSES FROM FIXED-INCOME SECURITIES ARE PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES. UNREALIZED

LOSSES FROM DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL EQUITIES ARE DUE TO MARKET PRICE MOVEMENTS. MANAGEMENT DOES NOT BELIEVE ANY REMAINING UNREALIZED LOSSES REPRESENT OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENTS BASED ON OUR EVALUATION OF AVAILABLE EVIDENCE AS OF

JUNE 30, 2011.

AT JUNE 30, 2011 AND 2010, THE RECORDED BASES AND ESTIMATED FAIR VALUES OF COMMON AND PREFERRED STOCK AND

ITEM 8

NOTE 5  DERIVATIVES

WE USE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS TO MANAGE RISKS RELATED TO FOREIGN CURRENCIES, EQUITY PRICES, INTEREST RATES, AND CREDIT; TO ENHANCE INVESTMENT

RETURNS; AND TO FACILITATE PORTFOLIO DIVERSIFICATION. OUR OBJECTIVES FOR HOLDING DERIVATIVES INCLUDE REDUCING, ELIMINATING, AND EFFICIENTLY MANAGING THE ECONOMIC IMPACT OF THESE EXPOSURES AS EFFECTIVELY AS POSSIBLE. OUR DERIVATIVE PROGRAMS INCLUDE

STRATEGIES THAT BOTH QUALIFY AND DO NOT QUALIFY FOR HEDGE ACCOUNTING TREATMENT. ALL NOTIONAL AMOUNTS PRESENTED BELOW ARE MEASURED IN U.S. CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS.

FOREIGN CURRENCY

CERTAIN FORECASTED TRANSACTIONS, ASSETS, AND LIABILITIES ARE EXPOSED TO

FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK. WE MONITOR OUR FOREIGN CURRENCY EXPOSURES DAILY TO MAXIMIZE THE ECONOMIC EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR FOREIGN CURRENCY HEDGE POSITIONS. OPTION AND FORWARD CONTRACTS ARE USED TO HEDGE A PORTION OF FORECASTED INTERNATIONAL REVENUE FOR

UP TO THREE YEARS IN THE FUTURE AND ARE DESIGNATED AS CASH-FLOW HEDGING INSTRUMENTS. PRINCIPAL CURRENCIES HEDGED INCLUDE THE EURO, JAPANESE YEN, BRITISH POUND, AND CANADIAN DOLLAR. AS OF JUNE 30, 2011 AND 2010, THE TOTAL NOTIONAL AMOUNTS OF

THESE FOREIGN EXCHANGE CONTRACTS SOLD WERE $10.6 BILLION AND $9.3 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY. FOREIGN CURRENCY RISKS RELATED TO CERTAIN NON-U.S. DOLLAR DENOMINATED SECURITIES ARE HEDGED USING FOREIGN EXCHANGE FORWARD CONTRACTS THAT ARE DESIGNATED AS

FAIR-VALUE HEDGING INSTRUMENTS. AS OF JUNE 30, 2011 AND 2010, THE TOTAL NOTIONAL AMOUNTS OF THESE FOREIGN EXCHANGE CONTRACTS SOLD WERE $572 MILLION AND $523 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. CERTAIN OPTIONS AND FORWARDS NOT DESIGNATED AS HEDGING

INSTRUMENTS ARE ALSO USED TO MANAGE THE VARIABILITY IN EXCHANGE RATES ON ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, CASH, AND INTERCOMPANY POSITIONS, AND TO MANAGE OTHER FOREIGN CURRENCY EXPOSURES. AS OF JUNE 30, 2011, THE TOTAL NOTIONAL AMOUNTS OF THESE

FOREIGN EXCHANGE CONTRACTS PURCHASED AND SOLD WERE $3.9 BILLION AND $7.3 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY. AS OF JUNE 30, 2010, THE TOTAL NOTIONAL AMOUNTS OF THESE FOREIGN EXCHANGE CONTRACTS PURCHASED AND SOLD WERE $7.8 BILLION AND $5.3 BILLION,

RESPECTIVELY.

EQUITY

SECURITIES HELD IN OUR EQUITY AND OTHER INVESTMENTS PORTFOLIO ARE SUBJECT TO MARKET PRICE RISK. MARKET PRICE RISK IS MANAGED RELATIVE TO

BROAD-BASED GLOBAL AND DOMESTIC EQUITY INDICES USING CERTAIN CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED INVESTMENTS, OPTIONS, FUTURES, AND SWAP CONTRACTS NOT DESIGNATED AS HEDGING INSTRUMENTS. FROM TIME TO TIME, TO HEDGE OUR PRICE RISK, WE MAY USE AND DESIGNATE EQUITY

DERIVATIVES AS HEDGING INSTRUMENTS, INCLUDING PUTS, CALLS, SWAPS, AND FORWARDS. AS OF JUNE 30, 2011, THE TOTAL NOTIONAL AMOUNTS OF DESIGNATED AND NON-DESIGNATED EQUITY CONTRACTS PURCHASED AND SOLD WERE $1.4 BILLION AND $935 MILLION,

RESPECTIVELY. AS OF JUNE 30, 2010, THE TOTAL NOTIONAL AMOUNTS OF DESIGNATED AND NON-DESIGNATED EQUITY CONTRACTS PURCHASED AND SOLD WERE $918 MILLION AND $472 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY.

INTEREST RATE

SECURITIES HELD IN OUR FIXED-INCOME PORTFOLIO ARE SUBJECT TO DIFFERENT INTEREST

RATE RISKS BASED ON THEIR MATURITIES. WE MANAGE THE AVERAGE MATURITY OF OUR FIXED-INCOME PORTFOLIO TO ACHIEVE ECONOMIC RETURNS THAT CORRELATE TO CERTAIN BROAD-BASED FIXED-INCOME INDICES USING EXCHANGE-TRADED OPTION AND FUTURES CONTRACTS AND

OVER-THE-COUNTER SWAP AND OPTION CONTRACTS, NONE OF WHICH ARE DESIGNATED AS HEDGING INSTRUMENTS. AS OF JUNE 30, 2011, THE TOTAL NOTIONAL AMOUNTS OF FIXED-INTEREST RATE CONTRACTS PURCHASED AND SOLD WERE $2.3 BILLION AND $2.2 BILLION,

RESPECTIVELY. AS OF JUNE 30, 2010, THE TOTAL NOTIONAL AMOUNTS OF FIXED-INTEREST RATE CONTRACTS PURCHASED AND SOLD WERE $3.1 BILLION AND $1.8 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY. IN ADDITION, WE USE TO BE ANNOUNCED FORWARD PURCHASE COMMITMENTS OF

MORTGAGE-BACKED ASSETS TO GAIN EXPOSURE TO AGENCY MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES. THESE MEET THE DEFINITION OF A DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENT IN CASES WHERE PHYSICAL DELIVERY OF THE ASSETS IS NOT TAKEN AT THE EARLIEST AVAILABLE DELIVERY DATE. AS OF

JUNE 30, 2011 AND 2010, THE TOTAL NOTIONAL DERIVATIVE AMOUNT OF MORTGAGE CONTRACTS PURCHASED WERE $868 MILLION AND $305 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY.

CREDIT

OUR FIXED-INCOME PORTFOLIO IS

DIVERSIFIED AND CONSISTS PRIMARILY OF INVESTMENT-GRADE SECURITIES. WE USE CREDIT DEFAULT SWAP CONTRACTS, NOT DESIGNATED AS HEDGING INSTRUMENTS, TO MANAGE CREDIT EXPOSURES RELATIVE TO BROAD-BASED INDICES AND TO FACILITATE PORTFOLIO DIVERSIFICATION.

WE USE CREDIT DEFAULT SWAPS AS THEY ARE A LOW COST METHOD OF MANAGING

ITEM 8

EXPOSURE TO INDIVIDUAL CREDIT RISKS OR GROUPS OF CREDIT RISKS. AS OF JUNE 30, 2011, THE TOTAL NOTIONAL AMOUNTS OF CREDIT CONTRACTS PURCHASED AND SOLD WERE $532 MILLION AND $277 MILLION,

RESPECTIVELY. AS OF JUNE 30, 2010, THE TOTAL NOTIONAL AMOUNTS OF CREDIT CONTRACTS PURCHASED AND SOLD WERE $371 MILLION AND $199 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY.

COMMODITY

WE USE BROAD-BASED COMMODITY EXPOSURES TO ENHANCE PORTFOLIO RETURNS AND TO

FACILITATE PORTFOLIO DIVERSIFICATION. WE USE SWAP, FUTURES AND OPTION CONTRACTS, NOT DESIGNATED AS HEDGING INSTRUMENTS, TO GENERATE AND MANAGE EXPOSURES TO BROAD-BASED COMMODITY INDICES. WE USE DERIVATIVES ON COMMODITIES AS THEY CAN BE LOW-COST

ALTERNATIVES TO THE PURCHASE AND STORAGE OF A VARIETY OF COMMODITIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, PRECIOUS METALS, ENERGY, AND GRAIN. AS OF JUNE 30, 2011, THE TOTAL NOTIONAL AMOUNTS OF COMMODITY CONTRACTS PURCHASED AND SOLD WERE $1.9 BILLION

AND $502 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. AS OF JUNE 30, 2010, THE TOTAL NOTIONAL AMOUNTS OF COMMODITY CONTRACTS PURCHASED AND SOLD WERE $1.1 BILLION AND $376 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY.

CREDIT RISK-RELATED CONTINGENT FEATURES

CERTAIN OF OUR COUNTERPARTY AGREEMENTS FOR DERIVATIVE

INSTRUMENTS CONTAIN PROVISIONS THAT REQUIRE OUR ISSUED AND OUTSTANDING LONG-TERM UNSECURED DEBT TO MAINTAIN AN INVESTMENT GRADE CREDIT RATING AND REQUIRE US TO MAINTAIN A MINIMUM LIQUIDITY OF $1.0 BILLION. TO THE EXTENT WE FAIL TO MEET THESE

REQUIREMENTS, WE WILL BE REQUIRED TO POST COLLATERAL, SIMILAR TO THE STANDARD CONVENTION RELATED TO OVER-THE-COUNTER DERIVATIVES. AS OF JUNE 30, 2011, OUR LONG-TERM UNSECURED DEBT RATING WAS AAA, AND CASH INVESTMENTS WERE IN EXCESS OF $1.0

BILLION. AS A RESULT, NO COLLATERAL WAS REQUIRED TO BE POSTED.

FAIR VALUES OF DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS

FOLLOWING ARE THE GROSS FAIR VALUES OF DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS DESIGNATED AS HEDGING INSTRUMENTS (DESIGNATED HEDGE DERIVATIVES) AND NOT

DESIGNATED AS HEDGING INSTRUMENTS (NON-DESIGNATED HEDGE DERIVATIVES) THAT WERE HELD AT JUNE 30, 2011 AND 2010. THE FAIR VALUES EXCLUDE THE IMPACT OF NETTING DERIVATIVE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES WHEN A LEGALLY ENFORCEABLE MASTER NETTING

AGREEMENT EXISTS AND FAIR VALUE ADJUSTMENTS RELATED TO OUR OWN CREDIT RISK AND COUNTERPARTY CREDIT RISK.

DURING FISCAL YEARS 2011 AND 2010, IMPAIRMENT CHARGES OF $2 MILLION AND $5 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, WERE RECOGNIZED FOR CERTAIN

CONVERTIBLE DEBT

IN JUNE 2010, WE ISSUED $1.25 BILLION OF ZERO COUPON CONVERTIBLE UNSECURED DEBT DUE ON JUNE 15, 2013 IN A PRIVATE PLACEMENT OFFERING. PROCEEDS FROM THE OFFERING WERE $1.24 BILLION, NET OF FEES AND EXPENSES,

WHICH WERE CAPITALIZED.

EACH $1,000 PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF NOTES IS CONVERTIBLE INTO 29.94 SHARES OF MICROSOFT COMMON STOCK AT A

CONVERSION PRICE OF $33.40 PER SHARE. AS OF JUNE 30, 2011, THE NET CARRYING AMOUNT OF OUR CONVERTIBLE DEBT WAS $1.2 BILLION AND THE UNAMORTIZED DISCOUNT WAS $38 MILLION.

PRIOR TO MARCH 15, 2013, THE NOTES WILL BE CONVERTIBLE, ONLY IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES, INTO CASH AND, IF APPLICABLE, CASH, SHARES OF MICROSOFTS COMMON STOCK, OR A COMBINATION THEREOF, AT OUR ELECTION. ON

OR AFTER MARCH 15, 2013, THE NOTES WILL BE CONVERTIBLE AT ANY TIME. UPON CONVERSION, WE WILL PAY CASH UP TO THE AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF THE NOTES AND PAY OR DELIVER CASH, SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK, OR A COMBINATION OF CASH AND SHARES OF

OUR COMMON STOCK, AT OUR ELECTION.

BECAUSE THE CONVERTIBLE DEBT MAY BE WHOLLY OR PARTIALLY SETTLED IN CASH, WE ARE REQUIRED TO

SEPARATELY ACCOUNT FOR THE LIABILITY AND EQUITY COMPONENTS OF THE NOTES IN A MANNER THAT REFLECTS OUR NONCONVERTIBLE DEBT BORROWING RATE WHEN INTEREST COSTS ARE RECOGNIZED IN SUBSEQUENT PERIODS. THE NET PROCEEDS OF $1.24 BILLION WERE ALLOCATED

BETWEEN DEBT FOR $1.18 BILLION AND STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY FOR $58 MILLION WITH THE PORTION IN STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY REPRESENTING THE FAIR VALUE OF THE OPTION TO CONVERT THE DEBT.

IN CONNECTION WITH THE ISSUANCE OF THE NOTES, WE ENTERED INTO CAPPED CALL TRANSACTIONS WITH CERTAIN OPTION COUNTERPARTIES WHO ARE INITIAL

PURCHASERS OF THE NOTES OR THEIR AFFILIATES. THE CAPPED CALL TRANSACTIONS ARE EXPECTED TO REDUCE POTENTIAL DILUTION OF EARNINGS PER SHARE UPON CONVERSION OF THE NOTES. UNDER THE CAPPED CALL TRANSACTIONS, WE PURCHASED FROM THE OPTION COUNTERPARTIES

CAPPED CALL OPTIONS THAT IN THE AGGREGATE RELATE TO THE TOTAL NUMBER OF SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK UNDERLYING THE NOTES, WITH A STRIKE PRICE EQUAL TO THE CONVERSION PRICE OF THE NOTES AND WITH A CAP PRICE EQUAL TO $37.16. THE PURCHASED CAPPED CALLS

WERE VALUED AT $40 MILLION AND RECORDED TO STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY.

DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL YEAR 2011, WE REACHED A PARTIAL SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT WITH THE I.R.S. ON TAX

YEARS 2004 TO 2006 AND RECORDED A $461 MILLION INCOME TAX PROVISION BENEFIT. DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF FISCAL YEAR 2011, THE I.R.S. COMPLETED ITS EXAMINATION AND ISSUED A REVENUE AGENTS REPORT (RAR) FOR THE REMAINING UNRESOLVED

ITEMS. WE DO NOT AGREE WITH THE ADJUSTMENTS IN THE RAR, AND WE HAVE FILED A PROTEST TO INITIATE THE ADMINISTRATIVE APPEALS PROCESS. THE PROPOSED ADJUSTMENTS ARE PRIMARILY RELATED TO TRANSFER PRICING AND COULD HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON OUR

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IF NOT RESOLVED FAVORABLY. WE DO NOT BELIEVE IT IS REASONABLY POSSIBLE THAT THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS WILL SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE OR DECREASE WITHIN THE NEXT 12 MONTHS, AS WE DO NOT BELIEVE THE APPEALS

PROCESS WILL BE CONCLUDED WITHIN THE NEXT 12 MONTHS. WE ALSO CONTINUE TO BE SUBJECT TO EXAMINATION BY THE I.R.S. FOR TAX YEARS 2007 TO 2010.

WE ARE SUBJECT TO INCOME TAX IN MANY JURISDICTIONS OUTSIDE THE U.S., AND CERTAIN JURISDICTIONS REMAIN SUBJECT TO EXAMINATION AND ARE CURRENTLY UNDER AUDIT BY LOCAL TAX AUTHORITIES. THE RESOLUTIONS OF THESE AUDITS

ARE NOT EXPECTED TO BE MATERIAL TO OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

INDEMNIFICATIONS

WE PROVIDE INDEMNIFICATIONS OF VARYING SCOPE AND SIZE TO CERTAIN CUSTOMERS AGAINST CLAIMS OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY INFRINGEMENT MADE BY THIRD PARTIES ARISING FROM THE USE OF OUR PRODUCTS AND CERTAIN OTHER MATTERS.

WE EVALUATE ESTIMATED LOSSES FOR THESE INDEMNIFICATIONS, AND WE CONSIDER SUCH FACTORS AS THE DEGREE OF PROBABILITY OF AN UNFAVORABLE OUTCOME AND THE ABILITY TO MAKE A REASONABLE ESTIMATE OF THE AMOUNT OF LOSS. TO DATE, WE HAVE NOT ENCOUNTERED

SIGNIFICANT COSTS AS A RESULT OF THESE OBLIGATIONS AND HAVE NOT ACCRUED ANY LIABILITIES RELATED TO THESE INDEMNIFICATIONS IN OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

YAHOO! COMMERCIAL AGREEMENT

ON

DECEMBER 4, 2009, WE ENTERED INTO A DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT WITH YAHOO! WHEREBY MICROSOFT WILL PROVIDE THE EXCLUSIVE ALGORITHMIC AND PAID SEARCH PLATFORM FOR YAHOO! WEB SITES. THE TERM OF THE AGREEMENT IS 10 YEARS SUBJECT TO TERMINATION PROVISIONS

AFTER FIVE YEARS BASED ON PERFORMANCE.

MICROSOFT PROVIDED YAHOO! WITH REVENUE PER SEARCH GUARANTEES FOR A PERIOD OF 18 MONTHS AFTER

IMPLEMENTATION OF THE MICROSOFT SEARCH ADS PLATFORM IN EACH COUNTRY. THESE GUARANTEES ARE CALCULATED, PAID AND TRUED-UP PERIODICALLY BASED ON THE CUMULATIVE REDUCTION IN REVENUE PER SEARCH, IF ANY, DURING THE 18-MONTH PERIOD FROM PRE-IMPLEMENTATION

LEVELS, EXCEPT IN THE CASE OF THE U.S. AND CANADA WHERE PERFORMANCE DURING EACH OF THE FIRST TWO CALENDAR QUARTERS AFTER IMPLEMENTATION IS INDEPENDENT AND NOT CUMULATIVE. THIS IS A RATE GUARANTEE AND NOT A GUARANTEE OF SEARCH VOLUME. WE ESTIMATE THE

TOTAL COST OF THE REVENUE PER SEARCH GUARANTEES DURING THE GUARANTEE PERIOD COULD RANGE UP TO $150 MILLION.

MICROSOFT ALSO AGREED TO

REIMBURSE YAHOO! FOR CERTAIN TRANSITION EXPENSES INCURRED BOTH BEFORE AND AFTER THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF THE AGREEMENT.

FINALLY, MICROSOFT

ALSO AGREED TO REIMBURSE YAHOO! FOR CERTAIN COSTS OF RUNNING ALGORITHMIC AND PAID SEARCH SERVICES PRIOR TO MIGRATION TO MICROSOFTS PLATFORM.

GOVERNMENT COMPETITION LAW MATTERS

SINCE 2001, WE HAVE BEEN SUBJECT TO A CONSENT DECREE AND

FINAL JUDGMENT (FINAL JUDGMENTS) THAT RESOLVED LAWSUITS BROUGHT BY THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE, 18 STATES, AND THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA IN TWO SEPARATE ACTIONS. THE FINAL JUDGMENTS IMPOSED VARIOUS CONSTRAINTS ON OUR WINDOWS OPERATING

SYSTEM BUSINESSES. THE FINAL JUDGMENTS EXPIRED IN MAY 2011.

IN OTHER ONGOING INVESTIGATIONS, VARIOUS FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS AND SEVERAL

STATE ATTORNEYS GENERAL HAVE REQUESTED INFORMATION FROM US CONCERNING COMPETITION, PRIVACY, AND SECURITY ISSUES.

ANTITRUST, UNFAIR COMPETITION, AND OVERCHARGE CLASS ACTIONS

A LARGE NUMBER OF ANTITRUST AND UNFAIR COMPETITION CLASS ACTION LAWSUITS WERE FILED AGAINST US IN VARIOUS STATE, FEDERAL, AND CANADIAN COURTS ON

BEHALF OF VARIOUS CLASSES OF DIRECT AND INDIRECT PURCHASERS OF OUR PC OPERATING SYSTEM AND CERTAIN OTHER SOFTWARE PRODUCTS. WE OBTAINED DISMISSALS OF DAMAGES CLAIMS OF INDIRECT PURCHASERS UNDER FEDERAL LAW AND IN 15 STATES. COURTS REFUSED TO CERTIFY

CLASSES IN TWO ADDITIONAL STATES. WE HAVE REACHED AGREEMENTS TO SETTLE ALL CLAIMS THAT HAVE BEEN MADE TO DATE IN 19 STATES AND THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA.

THE SETTLEMENTS IN ALL STATES HAVE RECEIVED FINAL COURT APPROVAL. UNDER THE SETTLEMENTS, GENERALLY CLASS MEMBERS CAN OBTAIN VOUCHERS THAT ENTITLE THEM TO BE REIMBURSED FOR PURCHASES OF A WIDE VARIETY OF

PLATFORM-NEUTRAL COMPUTER HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE. THE TOTAL VALUE OF VOUCHERS THAT WE MAY ISSUE VARIES BY STATE. WE WILL MAKE AVAILABLE TO CERTAIN SCHOOLS A PERCENTAGE OF THOSE VOUCHERS THAT ARE NOT ISSUED OR CLAIMED (ONE-HALF TO TWO-THIRDS DEPENDING

ON THE STATE). THE TOTAL VALUE OF VOUCHERS WE ULTIMATELY ISSUE WILL DEPEND ON THE NUMBER OF CLASS MEMBERS WHO MAKE CLAIMS AND ARE ISSUED VOUCHERS. THE MAXIMUM VALUE OF VOUCHERS TO BE ISSUED IS APPROXIMATELY $2.7 BILLION. THE ACTUAL COSTS OF THESE

SETTLEMENTS WILL BE LESS THAN THAT MAXIMUM AMOUNT, DEPENDING ON THE NUMBER OF CLASS MEMBERS AND SCHOOLS THAT ARE ISSUED AND REDEEM VOUCHERS. WE ESTIMATE THE TOTAL COST TO RESOLVE ALL OF THE STATE OVERCHARGE CLASS ACTION CASES WILL RANGE BETWEEN $1.9

BILLION AND $2.0 BILLION. AT JUNE 30, 2011, WE HAVE RECORDED A LIABILITY RELATED TO THESE CLAIMS OF APPROXIMATELY $568 MILLION, WHICH REFLECTS OUR ESTIMATED EXPOSURE OF $1.9 BILLION LESS PAYMENTS MADE TO DATE OF APPROXIMATELY $1.3 BILLION

MOSTLY FOR VOUCHERS, LEGAL FEES, AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES.

THE THREE CASES PENDING IN BRITISH COLUMBIA, ONTARIO, AND QUEBEC, CANADA

HAVE NOT BEEN SETTLED. IN MARCH 2010, THE COURT IN THE BRITISH COLUMBIA CASE CERTIFIED IT AS A CLASS ACTION. ON APRIL 15, 2011, THE BRITISH COLUMBIA COURT OF APPEAL REVERSED THE CLASS CERTIFICATION RULING AND DISMISSED THE CASE, HOLDING THAT

INDIRECT PURCHASERS DO NOT HAVE A CLAIM. THE PLAINTIFFS HAVE SOUGHT REVIEW BY THE CANADIAN SUPREME COURT. THE OTHER TWO ACTIONS HAVE BEEN STAYED.

OTHER ANTITRUST LITIGATION AND CLAIMS

IN

NOVEMBER 2004, NOVELL, INC. (NOVELL) FILED A COMPLAINT IN U.S. DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF UTAH (LATER TRANSFERRED TO FEDERAL COURT IN MARYLAND), ASSERTING ANTITRUST AND UNFAIR COMPETITION CLAIMS AGAINST US RELATED TO

NOVELLS OWNERSHIP OF WORDPERFECT AND OTHER PRODUCTIVITY APPLICATIONS DURING THE PERIOD BETWEEN JUNE 1994 AND MARCH 1996. IN JUNE 2005, THE TRIAL COURT GRANTED OUR MOTION TO DISMISS FOUR OF SIX CLAIMS OF THE COMPLAINT. IN MARCH 2010 THE

TRIAL COURT GRANTED SUMMARY JUDGMENT IN FAVOR OF MICROSOFT AS TO ALL REMAINING CLAIMS. THE COURT OF APPEALS HAS REVERSED THAT RULING, AND THE CASE IS SCHEDULED FOR TRIAL IN UTAH IN OCTOBER 2011.

PATENT AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY CLAIMS

IN

2003, WE FILED AN ACTION IN U.S. DISTRICT COURT IN CALIFORNIA SEEKING A DECLARATORY JUDGMENT THAT WE DO NOT INFRINGE CERTAIN ALCATEL-LUCENT PATENTS (ALTHOUGH THIS ACTION BEGAN BEFORE THE MERGER OF ALCATEL AND LUCENT IN 2006, FOR SIMPLICITY WE REFER

TO THE POST-MERGER ENTITY OF ALCATEL-LUCENT). IN APRIL 2008, A JURY RETURNED A VERDICT IN ALCATEL-LUCENTS FAVOR IN A TRIAL ON A CONSOLIDATED GROUP OF ONE VIDEO AND THREE USER INTERFACE PATENTS. THE JURY CONCLUDED THAT WE HAD INFRINGED TWO USER

INTERFACE PATENTS AND AWARDED $367 MILLION IN DAMAGES. IN JUNE 2008, THE TRIAL JUDGE INCREASED THE AMOUNT OF DAMAGES TO $512 MILLION TO INCLUDE $145 MILLION OF INTEREST. WE APPEALED THAT AWARD. IN DECEMBER 2008, WE ENTERED INTO A SETTLEMENT

AGREEMENT RESOLVING ALL OTHER LITIGATION PENDING BETWEEN MICROSOFT AND ALCATEL-LUCENT, LEAVING APPROXIMATELY $500 MILLION REMAINING IN DISPUTE. IN SEPTEMBER 2009, THE COURT OF APPEALS AFFIRMED THE LIABILITY AWARD BUT VACATED THE VERDICT AND

REMANDED THE CASE TO THE TRIAL COURT FOR A RE-TRIAL OF THE DAMAGES RULING, INDICATING THE DAMAGES PREVIOUSLY AWARDED WERE TOO HIGH. TRIAL ON THE REMANDED DAMAGES CLAIM WAS HELD IN JULY 2011.

IN OCTOBER 2003, UNILOC USA INC. (UNILOC), A SUBSIDIARY OF A SINGAPORE-BASED COMPANY, FILED A PATENT INFRINGEMENT SUIT IN U.S. DISTRICT

COURT IN RHODE ISLAND, CLAIMING THAT PRODUCT ACTIVATION TECHNOLOGY SUPPORTING WINDOWS XP AND CERTAIN OTHER MICROSOFT PROGRAMS VIOLATED A UNILOC PATENT. AFTER WE OBTAINED A FAVORABLE SUMMARY JUDGMENT THAT WE DID NOT INFRINGE ANY OF THE CLAIMS OF THIS

PATENT, THE COURT OF APPEALS VACATED THE TRIAL COURT DECISION AND REMANDED

74

TABLE OF CONTENTS

PART II

ITEM 8

THE CASE FOR TRIAL. IN APRIL 2009, THE JURY RETURNED A $388 MILLION VERDICT AGAINST US, INCLUDING A FINDING OF WILLFUL INFRINGEMENT. IN SEPTEMBER 2009, THE DISTRICT COURT JUDGE OVERTURNED

THE JURY VERDICT, RULING THAT THE EVIDENCE DID NOT SUPPORT THE JURYS FINDINGS EITHER THAT MICROSOFT INFRINGED THE PATENT OR WAS WILLFUL. UNILOC APPEALED, AND IN JANUARY 2011 THE COURT OF APPEALS REVERSED THE DISTRICT COURTS FINDING OF

NON-INFRINGEMENT (THUS REINSTATING THE JURY VERDICT OF INFRINGEMENT) BUT AFFIRMED THE DISTRICT COURTS RULING THAT MICROSOFT WAS NOT WILLFUL AND AFFIRMED THE DISTRICT COURTS GRANT OF A NEW TRIAL ON DAMAGES. UNILOCS PETITION FOR

REHEARING OF THE COURT OF APPEALS DECISION AS TO DAMAGES WAS DENIED. A NEW TRIAL ON DAMAGES HAS BEEN SET FOR JANUARY 2012.

IN

MARCH 2007, I4I LIMITED PARTNERSHIP (I4I) SUED MICROSOFT IN U.S. DISTRICT COURT IN TEXAS CLAIMING THAT CERTAIN CUSTOM XML TECHNOLOGY IN WORD 2003 AND 2007 INFRINGED I4IS PATENT. IN MAY 2009, A JURY RETURNED A VERDICT AGAINST US,

FINDING DAMAGES OF $200 MILLION AND THAT WE WILLFULLY INFRINGED THE PATENT. IN AUGUST 2009, THE COURT DENIED OUR POST-TRIAL MOTIONS AND AWARDED ENHANCED DAMAGES OF $40 MILLION AND PREJUDGMENT INTEREST OF $37 MILLION. THE COURT ALSO ISSUED A

PERMANENT INJUNCTION PROHIBITING ADDITIONAL DISTRIBUTION OF THE ALLEGEDLY INFRINGING TECHNOLOGY. WE APPEALED AND THE APPELLATE COURT STAYED THE INJUNCTION PENDING OUR APPEAL. IN DECEMBER 2009, THE COURT OF APPEALS REJECTED OUR APPEAL AND

AFFIRMED THE TRIAL COURTS JUDGMENT AND INJUNCTION, EXCEPT THAT THE COURT OF APPEALS MODIFIED THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF THE INJUNCTION TO JANUARY 11, 2010. WE APPEALED TO THE U.S. SUPREME COURT, AND IN JUNE 2011 THE COURT AFFIRMED THE JUDGMENT

OF THE COURT OF APPEALS.

IN OCTOBER 2010, WE FILED SUIT AGAINST MOTOROLA WITH THE INTERNATIONAL TRADE COMMISSION (ITC) AND

IN U.S. DISTRICT COURT IN WASHINGTON FOR INFRINGEMENT OF NINE MICROSOFT PATENTS BY MOTOROLAS ANDROID-BASED DEVICES. SINCE THEN, MICROSOFT AND MOTOROLA HAVE FILED ADDITIONAL ACTIONS AGAINST EACH OTHER IN THE ITC AND FEDERAL COURTS IN

WASHINGTON, WISCONSIN, FLORIDA, AND CALIFORNIA. MICROSOFT ASSERTS MOTOROLAS ANDROID-BASED DEVICES VIOLATE 23 OF ITS PATENTS, AND MOTOROLA ASSERTS VARIOUS MICROSOFT PRODUCTS (INCLUDING WINDOWS, WINDOWS PHONE 7, WINDOWS MOBILE 6.5, XBOX, BING

MAPS, HOTMAIL, MESSENGER, AND EXCHANGE SERVER) VIOLATE 21 MOTOROLA PATENTS. MICROSOFT ALSO CLAIMS MOTOROLA HAS BREACHED ITS CONTRACTUAL COMMITMENTS TO THE INSTITUTE OF ELECTRICAL AND ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS (IEEE) AND INTERNATIONAL

TELECOMMUNICATIONS UNION (ITU) TO LICENSE IDENTIFIED PATENTS RELATED TO WIRELESS AND VIDEO CODING TECHNOLOGIES UNDER REASONABLE AND NON-DISCRIMINATORY (RAND) TERMS AND CONDITIONS. MOTOROLA ASSERTS THAT MICROSOFT BREACHED

CONTRACTUAL COMMITMENTS TO THE SD CARD ASSOCIATION TO LICENSE TWO PATENTS UNDER RAND TERMS AND CONDITIONS, AND ASSERTS FEDERAL ANTITRUST AND STATE UNFAIR BUSINESS PRACTICE CLAIMS. TRIAL IN OUR ITC CASE IS SET FOR AUGUST 2011, TRIAL IN

MOTOROLAS ITC CASE IS SET FOR OCTOBER 2011, AND TRIAL OF BOTH PARTIES PATENT INFRINGEMENT CLAIMS IN FLORIDA ALSO IS SET FOR OCTOBER 2011.

IN ADDITION TO THESE CASES, THERE ARE APPROXIMATELY 55 OTHER PATENT INFRINGEMENT CASES PENDING AGAINST MICROSOFT.

OTHER

WE ALSO ARE SUBJECT TO A VARIETY OF

OTHER CLAIMS AND SUITS THAT ARISE FROM TIME TO TIME IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF OUR BUSINESS. ALTHOUGH MANAGEMENT CURRENTLY BELIEVES THAT RESOLVING CLAIMS AGAINST US, INDIVIDUALLY OR IN AGGREGATE, WILL NOT HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, THESE MATTERS ARE SUBJECT TO INHERENT UNCERTAINTIES AND MANAGEMENTS VIEW OF THESE MATTERS MAY CHANGE IN THE FUTURE.

AS OF JUNE 30, 2011, WE HAD ACCRUED AGGREGATE LIABILITIES OF $693 MILLION IN OTHER CURRENT LIABILITIES AND $276 MILLION IN OTHER LONG-TERM LIABILITIES FOR ALL OF THE CONTINGENT MATTERS DESCRIBED IN THIS NOTE.

WHILE WE INTEND TO VIGOROUSLY DEFEND THESE MATTERS, THERE EXISTS THE POSSIBILITY OF ADVERSE OUTCOMES THAT WE ESTIMATE COULD REACH APPROXIMATELY $800 MILLION IN AGGREGATE BEYOND RECORDED AMOUNTS. WERE UNFAVORABLE FINAL OUTCOMES TO OCCUR, THERE EXISTS

THE POSSIBILITY OF A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE PERIOD IN WHICH THE EFFECTS BECOME REASONABLY ESTIMABLE.

STOCK AWARDS

STOCK AWARDS

(SAS) ARE GRANTS THAT ENTITLE THE HOLDER TO SHARES OF MICROSOFT COMMON STOCK AS THE AWARD VESTS. OUR SAS GENERALLY VEST OVER A FIVE-YEAR PERIOD.

SHARED PERFORMANCE STOCK AWARDS

SHARED PERFORMANCE STOCK AWARDS (SPSAS) ARE A

FORM OF SA IN WHICH THE NUMBER OF SHARES ULTIMATELY RECEIVED DEPENDS ON OUR BUSINESS PERFORMANCE AGAINST SPECIFIED PERFORMANCE TARGETS.

WE GRANTED SPSAS FOR FISCAL YEARS 2011, 2010, AND 2009 WITH PERFORMANCE PERIODS OF JULY 1, 2010 THROUGH JUNE 30, 2011, JULY 1,

2009 THROUGH JUNE 30, 2010, AND JULY 1, 2008 THROUGH JUNE 30, 2009, RESPECTIVELY. IN AUGUST FOLLOWING THE END OF EACH PERFORMANCE PERIOD, THE NUMBER OF SHARES OF STOCK SUBJECT TO THE AWARD IS DETERMINED BY MULTIPLYING THE TARGET AWARD

BY A PERCENTAGE RANGING FROM 0% TO 150%. THE PERCENTAGE IS BASED ON PERFORMANCE METRICS FOR THE PERFORMANCE PERIOD, AS DETERMINED BY THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS IN ITS SOLE DISCRETION. AN ADDITIONAL NUMBER OF SHARES,

APPROXIMATELY 12% OF THE TOTAL TARGET SPSAS, ARE AVAILABLE AS ADDITIONAL AWARDS TO PARTICIPANTS BASED ON INDIVIDUAL PERFORMANCE. ONE-QUARTER OF THE SHARES OF STOCK SUBJECT TO EACH AWARD VEST FOLLOWING THE END OF THE PERFORMANCE PERIOD, AND AN

ADDITIONAL ONE-QUARTER OF THE SHARES VEST ON EACH OF THE FOLLOWING THREE ANNIVERSARIES OF THE GRANT DATE.

EXECUTIVE OFFICER INCENTIVE PLAN

UNDER THE EXECUTIVE OFFICER INCENTIVE PLAN (EOIP), THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE AWARDS PERFORMANCE-BASED COMPENSATION TO

EXECUTIVE OFFICERS OF THE COMPANY FOR SPECIFIED PERFORMANCE PERIODS. DURING THE PERIODS REPORTED, EXECUTIVE OFFICERS WERE ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE ANNUAL AWARDS COMPRISED OF CASH AND SAS FROM AN AGGREGATE INCENTIVE POOL EQUAL TO A PERCENTAGE OF THE

COMPANYS OPERATING INCOME. FOR FISCAL YEARS 2011, 2010, AND 2009, THE POOL WAS 0.25%, 0.45%, AND 0.35% OF OPERATING INCOME, RESPECTIVELY.

IN SEPTEMBER FOLLOWING THE END OF THE FISCAL YEAR, EACH EXECUTIVE OFFICER MAY RECEIVE A COMBINED CASH AND SA AWARD WITH A TOTAL VALUE EQUAL TO A FIXED PERCENTAGE OF THE AGGREGATE POOL. THE FIXED PERCENTAGE RANGES

BETWEEN 0% AND 150% OF A TARGET BASED ON AN ASSESSMENT OF THE EXECUTIVE OFFICERS PERFORMANCE DURING THE PRIOR FISCAL YEAR. FOLLOWING APPROVAL OF THE AWARDS, 20% OF THE AWARD IS PAYABLE TO THE EXECUTIVE OFFICERS IN CASH, AND THE REMAINING 80%

IS CONVERTED INTO AN SA FOR SHARES OF MICROSOFT COMMON STOCK. THE NUMBER OF SHARES SUBJECT TO THE SA PORTION OF THE AWARD IS DETERMINED BY DIVIDING THE VALUE OF 80% OF THE TOTAL AWARD BY THE CLOSING PRICE OF MICROSOFT COMMON STOCK ON THE LAST

BUSINESS DAY IN AUGUST OF EACH YEAR. THE SA PORTION OF THE AWARD VESTS ONE-QUARTER IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE AWARD IS APPROVED FOLLOWING FISCAL YEAR-END AND ONE-QUARTER ON AUGUST 31 OF EACH OF THE FOLLOWING THREE YEARS.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

TO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND STOCKHOLDERS OF MICROSOFT CORPORATION.

WE HAVE AUDITED THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS OF MICROSOFT CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES (THE COMPANY) AS OF JUNE 30, 2011 AND 2010, AND THE RELATED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME,

CASH FLOWS, AND STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY FOR EACH OF THE THREE YEARS IN THE PERIOD ENDED JUNE 30, 2011. THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE COMPANYS MANAGEMENT. OUR RESPONSIBILITY IS TO EXPRESS AN OPINION ON

THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS BASED ON OUR AUDITS.

WE CONDUCTED OUR AUDITS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE STANDARDS OF THE PUBLIC COMPANY

ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BOARD (UNITED STATES). THOSE STANDARDS REQUIRE THAT WE PLAN AND PERFORM THE AUDIT TO OBTAIN REASONABLE ASSURANCE ABOUT WHETHER THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE FREE OF MATERIAL MISSTATEMENT. AN AUDIT INCLUDES EXAMINING, ON

A TEST BASIS, EVIDENCE SUPPORTING THE AMOUNTS AND DISCLOSURES IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. AN AUDIT ALSO INCLUDES ASSESSING THE ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES USED AND SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES MADE BY MANAGEMENT, AS WELL AS EVALUATING THE OVERALL FINANCIAL

THE PERIOD COVERED BY THIS REPORT. BASED ON THAT EVALUATION, THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER HAVE CONCLUDED THAT THESE DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES ARE EFFECTIVE.

REPORT OF MANAGEMENT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

OUR MANAGEMENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ESTABLISHING AND MAINTAINING ADEQUATE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING FOR THE COMPANY. INTERNAL CONTROL

OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING IS A PROCESS TO PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING THE RELIABILITY OF OUR FINANCIAL REPORTING FOR EXTERNAL PURPOSES IN ACCORDANCE WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. INTERNAL

CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING INCLUDES MAINTAINING RECORDS THAT IN REASONABLE DETAIL ACCURATELY AND FAIRLY REFLECT OUR TRANSACTIONS; PROVIDING REASONABLE ASSURANCE THAT TRANSACTIONS ARE RECORDED AS NECESSARY FOR PREPARATION OF OUR FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS; PROVIDING REASONABLE ASSURANCE THAT RECEIPTS AND EXPENDITURES OF COMPANY ASSETS ARE MADE IN ACCORDANCE WITH MANAGEMENT AUTHORIZATION; AND PROVIDING REASONABLE ASSURANCE THAT UNAUTHORIZED ACQUISITION, USE OR DISPOSITION OF COMPANY ASSETS

THAT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS WOULD BE PREVENTED OR DETECTED ON A TIMELY BASIS. BECAUSE OF ITS INHERENT LIMITATIONS, INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING IS NOT INTENDED TO PROVIDE ABSOLUTE ASSURANCE THAT A

MISSTATEMENT OF OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS WOULD BE PREVENTED OR DETECTED.

MANAGEMENT CONDUCTED AN EVALUATION OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR

INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING BASED ON THE FRAMEWORK IN

INTERNAL CONTROL  INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK

ISSUED BY THE COMMITTEE OF SPONSORING ORGANIZATIONS OF THE TREADWAY COMMISSION. BASED ON THIS EVALUATION, MANAGEMENT CONCLUDED

THAT THE COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING WAS EFFECTIVE AS OF JUNE 30, 2011. THERE WERE NO CHANGES IN OUR INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING DURING THE QUARTER ENDED JUNE 30, 2011 THAT HAVE MATERIALLY

AFFECTED, OR ARE REASONABLY LIKELY TO MATERIALLY AFFECT, OUR INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING. DELOITTE & TOUCHE LLP HAS AUDITED OUR INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF JUNE 30, 2011; THEIR REPORT IS INCLUDED IN

TO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND STOCKHOLDERS OF MICROSOFT CORPORATION.

WE HAVE AUDITED THE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING OF MICROSOFT CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES (THE COMPANY) AS OF JUNE 30, 2011, BASED ON CRITERIA ESTABLISHED IN

INTERNAL CONTROL

 INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK

ISSUED BY THE COMMITTEE OF SPONSORING ORGANIZATIONS OF THE TREADWAY COMMISSION. THE COMPANYS MANAGEMENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR MAINTAINING EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AND FOR ITS

ASSESSMENT OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, INCLUDED IN THE ACCOMPANYING REPORT OF MANAGEMENT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING. OUR RESPONSIBILITY IS TO EXPRESS AN OPINION ON THE COMPANYS

INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING BASED ON OUR AUDIT.

WE CONDUCTED OUR AUDIT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE STANDARDS OF THE PUBLIC

COMPANY ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BOARD (UNITED STATES). THOSE STANDARDS REQUIRE THAT WE PLAN AND PERFORM THE AUDIT TO OBTAIN REASONABLE ASSURANCE ABOUT WHETHER EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING WAS MAINTAINED IN ALL MATERIAL

RESPECTS. OUR AUDIT INCLUDED OBTAINING AN UNDERSTANDING OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, ASSESSING THE RISK THAT A MATERIAL WEAKNESS EXISTS, TESTING AND EVALUATING THE DESIGN AND OPERATING EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL CONTROL BASED ON

THE ASSESSED RISK, AND PERFORMING SUCH OTHER PROCEDURES AS WE CONSIDERED NECESSARY IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR AUDIT PROVIDES A REASONABLE BASIS FOR OUR OPINION.

A COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING IS A PROCESS DESIGNED BY, OR UNDER THE SUPERVISION OF, THE COMPANYS PRINCIPAL

EXECUTIVE AND PRINCIPAL FINANCIAL OFFICERS, OR PERSONS PERFORMING SIMILAR FUNCTIONS, AND EFFECTED BY THE COMPANYS BOARD OF DIRECTORS, MANAGEMENT, AND OTHER PERSONNEL TO PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING THE RELIABILITY OF FINANCIAL

REPORTING AND THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR EXTERNAL PURPOSES IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES. A COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING INCLUDES THOSE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES THAT

(1) PERTAIN TO THE MAINTENANCE OF RECORDS THAT, IN REASONABLE DETAIL, ACCURATELY AND FAIRLY REFLECT THE TRANSACTIONS AND DISPOSITIONS OF THE ASSETS OF THE COMPANY; (2) PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE THAT TRANSACTIONS ARE RECORDED AS

NECESSARY TO PERMIT PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES, AND THAT RECEIPTS AND EXPENDITURES OF THE COMPANY ARE BEING MADE ONLY IN ACCORDANCE WITH AUTHORIZATIONS OF MANAGEMENT AND DIRECTORS

OF THE COMPANY; AND (3) PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING PREVENTION OR TIMELY DETECTION OF UNAUTHORIZED ACQUISITION, USE, OR DISPOSITION OF THE COMPANYS ASSETS THAT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

BECAUSE OF THE INHERENT LIMITATIONS OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, INCLUDING THE POSSIBILITY OF COLLUSION OR IMPROPER

MANAGEMENT OVERRIDE OF CONTROLS, MATERIAL MISSTATEMENTS DUE TO ERROR OR FRAUD MAY NOT BE PREVENTED OR DETECTED ON A TIMELY BASIS. ALSO, PROJECTIONS OF ANY EVALUATION OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING TO

FUTURE PERIODS ARE SUBJECT TO THE RISK THAT THE CONTROLS MAY BECOME INADEQUATE BECAUSE OF CHANGES IN CONDITIONS, OR THAT THE DEGREE OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE POLICIES OR PROCEDURES MAY DETERIORATE.

IN OUR OPINION, THE COMPANY MAINTAINED, IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS, EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF JUNE 30, 2011,

BASED ON THE CRITERIA ESTABLISHED IN

INTERNAL CONTROL  INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK

ISSUED BY THE COMMITTEE OF SPONSORING ORGANIZATIONS OF THE TREADWAY COMMISSION.

WE HAVE ALSO AUDITED, IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE STANDARDS OF THE PUBLIC COMPANY ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BOARD (UNITED STATES), THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AS OF AND FOR THE YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2011, OF THE

COMPANY AND OUR REPORT DATED JULY 28, 2011, EXPRESSED AN UNQUALIFIED OPINION ON THOSE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.
