BUSINESS

GENERAL

MICROSOFT CORPORATION WAS FOUNDED AS A PARTNERSHIP IN 1975 AND INCORPORATED IN 1981. OUR MISSION IS TO

INITIATIVE CALLED TRUSTWORTHY COMPUTING THAT AIMS TO BRING AN ENHANCED LEVEL OF SECURITY, PRIVACY, RELIABILITY, AND BUSINESS INTEGRITY TO COMPUTER SYSTEMS.

OBJECTIVES AMONG DEVELOPMENT, SALES, MARKETING, AND SERVICES ORGANIZATIONS; PROVIDE FOR MORE TIMELY AND RATIONAL ALLOCATION OF DEVELOPMENT, SALES, AND MARKETING RESOURCES WITHIN BUSINESSES; FOCUS STRATEGIC PLANNING EFFORTS ON KEY OBJECTIVES AND

INITIATIVES; AND GIVE BUSINESS OWNERS MORE AUTONOMY IN DETAILED PLANNING.

MICROSOFT DEVELOPS AND SELLS PRODUCTS THROUGHOUT THE WORLD. OUR THREE MAJOR GEOGRAPHIC SALES AND MARKETING ORGANIZATIONS ARE THE AMERICAS REGION, THE EUROPE, MIDDLE EAST, AND AFRICA REGION, AND THE JAPAN AND ASIA-PACIFIC

REGION. PRESSURE TO GLOBALIZE OUR PRICING STRUCTURE MIGHT REQUIRE THAT WE REDUCE THE SALES PRICE OF OUR SOFTWARE IN THE UNITED STATES AND OTHER COUNTRIES. A NUMBER OF OTHER FACTORS COULD ALSO HAVE A NEGATIVE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS AND RESULTS FROM

OPERATIONS OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES, INCLUDING CHANGES IN TRADE PROTECTION LAWS, POLICIES AND MEASURES, AND OTHER REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS AFFECTING TRADE AND INVESTMENT; UNEXPECTED CHANGES IN REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS FOR SOFTWARE; SOCIAL,

POLITICAL, LABOR, OR ECONOMIC CONDITIONS IN A SPECIFIC COUNTRY OR REGION, INCLUDING FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES; DIFFICULTIES IN STAFFING AND MANAGING FOREIGN OPERATIONS; AND POTENTIAL ADVERSE FOREIGN TAX CONSEQUENCES. A PORTION OF INTERNATIONAL REVENUE

IS HEDGED, THUS OFFSETTING A PORTION OF THE CURRENCY TRANSLATION EXPOSURE.

EQUITY

METHOD INVESTMENTS

WE HAVE ENTERED INTO JOINT VENTURE ARRANGEMENTS TO TAKE

ADVANTAGE OF CREATIVE TALENT AND CONTENT FROM OTHER ORGANIZATIONS. FOR EXAMPLE, WE OWN 50 PERCENT OF MSNBC CABLE L.L.C., A 24-HOUR CABLE NEWS AND INFORMATION CHANNEL, AND 50 PERCENT OF MSNBC INTERACTIVE NEWS L.L.C., AN INTERACTIVE ONLINE NEWS

SERVICE. NATIONAL BROADCASTING COMPANY (NBC) OWNS THE REMAINING 50 PERCENT OF EACH OF THESE JOINT VENTURES.

PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT

DURING FISCAL YEARS 2001, 2002, AND

2003, RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSE WAS $4.38 BILLION, $4.31 BILLION, AND $4.66 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY. THOSE AMOUNTS REPRESENTED 17.3%, 15.2%, AND 14.5%, RESPECTIVELY, OF REVENUE IN EACH OF THOSE YEARS. DURING FISCAL YEAR 2001, $272 MILLION OF

GOODWILL AMORTIZATION WAS INCLUDED IN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSE. NO GOODWILL AMORTIZATION IS INCLUDED IN FISCAL YEARS 2002 AND 2003, IN ACCORDANCE WITH STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS (SFAS) 142,

GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE

ASSETS.

WE PLAN TO CONTINUE SPENDING SIGNIFICANT AMOUNTS FOR RESEARCH AND PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT.

MOST OF OUR SOFTWARE PRODUCTS ARE DEVELOPED

INTERNALLY. WE ALSO PURCHASE TECHNOLOGY, LICENSE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS, AND OVERSEE THIRD-PARTY DEVELOPMENT AND LOCALIZATION OF CERTAIN PRODUCTS. WE DO NOT BELIEVE WE ARE MATERIALLY DEPENDENT UPON LICENSES AND OTHER AGREEMENTS WITH THIRD

PARTIES RELATING TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF OUR PRODUCTS. INTERNAL DEVELOPMENT ALLOWS US TO MAINTAIN CLOSER TECHNICAL CONTROL OVER OUR PRODUCTS AND GIVES US THE FREEDOM TO DESIGNATE WHICH MODIFICATIONS AND ENHANCEMENTS ARE MOST IMPORTANT AND WHEN THEY

SHOULD BE IMPLEMENTED. WE WORK TO DEVISE INNOVATIVE SOLUTIONS IN COMPUTER SCIENCE, SUCH AS MAKING COMPUTERS EASIER TO USE, DESIGNING SOFTWARE FOR THE NEXT GENERATION OF HARDWARE, IMPROVING THE SOFTWARE DESIGN PROCESS, AND INVESTIGATING THE

MATHEMATICAL UNDERPINNINGS OF COMPUTER SCIENCE. WE HAVE CREATED A SUBSTANTIAL BODY OF DEVELOPMENT TOOLS AND HAVE EVOLVED DEVELOPMENT METHODOLOGIES FOR CREATING AND ENHANCING OUR PRODUCTS. THESE TOOLS AND METHODOLOGIES ARE ALSO DESIGNED TO SIMPLIFY A

PRODUCTS PORTABILITY AMONG DIFFERENT OPERATING SYSTEMS, MICROPROCESSORS, AND COMPUTING DEVICES. PRODUCT DOCUMENTATION IS GENERALLY CREATED INTERNALLY. WE STRIVE TO OBTAIN INFORMATION AT THE EARLIEST POSSIBLE TIME ABOUT CHANGING USAGE PATTERNS

AND HARDWARE ADVANCES THAT MAY AFFECT SOFTWARE DESIGN. BEFORE RELEASING NEW SOFTWARE PLATFORMS, WE PROVIDE TO APPLICATION VENDORS A RANGE OF RESOURCES AND GUIDELINES FOR DEVELOPMENT, TRAINING, AND TESTING.

MICROSOFT .NET IS OUR STRATEGY AND IMPLEMENTATION OF CONNECTING PEOPLE, INFORMATION, SYSTEMS AND DEVICES THROUGH THE USE OF WEB SERVICES. IT INCLUDES EVERYTHING

NEEDED TO DEVELOP AND DEPLOY A WEB SERVICE-CONNECTED IT ARCHITECTURE: SERVERS TO HOST WEB SERVICES (WINDOWS SERVER SYSTEM AND WINDOWS SERVER 2003), DEVELOPMENT TOOLS TO CREATE THEM (MICROSOFT VISUAL STUDIO .NET 2003 AND THE .NET FRAMEWORK),

APPLICATIONS AND SMART DEVICES THAT USE THEM (MICROSOFT OFFICE SYSTEM, SMART PHONES, POCKET PCS AND PCS), AND A WORLDWIDE NETWORK OF MORE THAN 35,000 MICROSOFT CERTIFIED PARTNER ORGANIZATIONS  PEOPLE WHOSE SKILLS AND EXPERIENCE CAN HELP

BUSINESSES GET THE MOST FROM THEIR IT INVESTMENTS. BUILT ON INDUSTRY STANDARDS, WEB SERVICES ENABLE APPLICATIONS TO COMMUNICATE AND SHARE DATA OVER THE INTERNET OR AN INTRANET, REGARDLESS OF OPERATING SYSTEM OR PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE.

WE BELIEVE THAT ESTABLISHING TRUST IN COMPUTING WILL BE CRITICAL TO OUR FUTURE SUCCESS. TRUSTWORTHY COMPUTING MEANS HELPING ENSURE A SAFE AND RELIABLE COMPUTING

EXPERIENCE THAT IS BOTH EXPECTED AND TAKEN FOR GRANTED. ACHIEVING TRUSTWORTHY COMPUTING WILL REQUIRE THE COLLABORATION OF HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE COMPANIES, ACADEMIC AND GOVERNMENT RESEARCH INSTITUTIONS, AND POLICY LEADERS. FOR US, TRUSTWORTHY

COMPUTING IS A COMPANY-WIDE INITIATIVE AIMED AT CHANGING HOW WE DO BUSINESS THAT WILL TAKE FUNDAMENTAL RESEARCH AND ADVANCES IN ENGINEERING, AS WELL AS CHANGES TO BUSINESS CULTURE AND BUSINESS PROCESSES TO ACCOMPLISH. WE THINK THERE ARE FOUR FACTORS

THAT AFFECT THE LEVEL OF TRUST THAT PEOPLE PLACE IN COMPUTING: SECURITY, PRIVACY, RELIABILITY, AND BUSINESS INTEGRITY. SECURITY MEANS THE CUSTOMER CAN EXPECT THAT SYSTEMS ARE RESILIENT TO ATTACK, AND THAT THE CONFIDENTIALITY, INTEGRITY, AND

AVAILABILITY OF THE SYSTEM AND ITS DATA ARE PROTECTED. PRIVACY MEANS THE CUSTOMER IS ABLE TO CONTROL PERSONAL INFORMATION AND FEEL CONFIDENT IT IS NOT ONLY SAFE AND USED APPROPRIATELY, BUT IN A WAY THAT PROVIDES VALUE. A RELIABLE SYSTEM OR

PART I, ITEM 1

SERVICE IS ONE THE CUSTOMER CAN DEPEND ON TO FULFILL ITS FUNCTIONS. BUSINESS INTEGRITY INVOLVES BEING RESPONSIVE TO CUSTOMERS, ADDRESSING PROBLEMS EFFECTIVELY WITH

PRODUCTS OR SERVICES, AND BEING TRANSPARENT AND RESPONSIVE IN CUSTOMER INTERACTIONS.

TO SERVE THE NEEDS OF USERS AROUND THE WORLD, WE

LOCALIZE MANY OF OUR PRODUCTS TO REFLECT LOCAL LANGUAGES AND CONVENTIONS AND TO IMPROVE THE QUALITY AND USABILITY OF THE PRODUCT IN INTERNATIONAL MARKETS. LOCALIZING A PRODUCT MAY REQUIRE MODIFYING THE USER INTERFACE, ALTERING DIALOG

BOXES, AND TRANSLATING TEXT.

MANUFACTURING

WE CONTRACT OUT MOST OF OUR MANUFACTURING ACTIVITIES TO THIRD PARTIES. OUTSIDE MANUFACTURERS PRODUCE

THE XBOX, VARIOUS RETAIL SOFTWARE PACKAGED PRODUCTS, AND HARDWARE. OUR PRODUCTS MAY INCLUDE SOME COMPONENTS THAT ARE AVAILABLE FROM ONLY ONE OR FROM LIMITED SOURCES. KEY COMPONENTS THAT ARE CURRENTLY OBTAINED FROM A SINGLE SOURCE INCLUDE THE XBOX

CENTRAL PROCESSING UNIT (CPU) FROM INTEL CORPORATION AND THE XBOX GRAPHICS PROCESSING UNIT (GPU) FROM NVIDIA CORPORATION. WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE XBOX CPU AND GPU, WE GENERALLY HAVE THE ABILITY TO USE OTHER CUSTOM MANUFACTURERS IF THE CURRENT

MANUFACTURING VENDOR BECOMES UNAVAILABLE. WE GENERALLY HAVE MULTIPLE SOURCES FOR RAW MATERIALS, SUPPLIES, AND COMPONENTS AND ARE OFTEN ABLE TO ACQUIRE COMPONENT PARTS AND MATERIALS ON A VOLUME DISCOUNT BASIS.

OPERATIONS

WE HAVE REGIONAL OPERATIONS CENTERS IN IRELAND, SINGAPORE, AND THE GREATER SEATTLE AREA. THE CENTERS SUPPORT ALL OPERATIONS IN THEIR REGIONS,

INCLUDING INFORMATION PROCESSING AND VENDOR MANAGEMENT AND LOGISTICS. THE REGIONAL CENTER IN DUBLIN, IRELAND SUPPORTS THE EUROPE, MIDDLE EAST, AND AFRICA REGION, THE CENTER IN SINGAPORE SUPPORTS THE JAPAN AND ASIA-PACIFIC REGION, AND THE CENTER IN

THE GREATER SEATTLE AREA SUPPORTS NORTH AND SOUTH AMERICA. MICROSOFT LICENSING, INC., A WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARY IN RENO, NEVADA, MANAGES OUR ORIGINAL EQUIPMENT MANUFACTURER (OEM) AND CERTAIN ORGANIZATIONAL LICENSING OPERATIONS.

DISTRIBUTION, SALES AND MARKETING

WE DISTRIBUTE OUR PRODUCTS PRIMARILY THROUGH THE FOLLOWING CHANNELS: OEM; DISTRIBUTORS AND RESELLERS; AND ONLINE SERVICES AND PRODUCTS. OUR THREE

MAJOR GEOGRAPHIC SALES AND MARKETING ORGANIZATIONS ARE THE AMERICAS REGION; THE EUROPE, MIDDLE EAST, AND AFRICA REGION; AND THE JAPAN AND ASIA-PACIFIC REGION.

OEM

MICROSOFT OPERATING SYSTEMS ARE LICENSED PRIMARILY TO OEMS UNDER AGREEMENTS THAT GRANT THE OEMS THE RIGHT TO DISTRIBUTE COPIES OF OUR PRODUCTS WITH THEIR COMPUTING DEVICES, PRINCIPALLY PCS. WE ALSO MARKET AND LICENSE CERTAIN SERVER

OPERATING SYSTEMS, DESKTOP APPLICATIONS, HARDWARE DEVICES, AND CONSUMER SOFTWARE PRODUCTS TO OEMS UNDER SIMILAR ARRANGEMENTS. WE HAVE OEM AGREEMENTS COVERING ONE OR MORE OF OUR PRODUCTS WITH VIRTUALLY ALL OF THE MAJOR PC OEMS, INCLUDING ACER,

ACTEBIS, DELL, EMACHINES, FUJITSU, FUJITSU GATEWAY, HP, IBM, NEC, SAMSUNG, SIEMENS COMPUTERS, SONY, AND TOSHIBA. A SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF OEM BUSINESS IS ALSO CONDUCTED WITH SYSTEM BUILDERS, WHICH ARE LOW-VOLUME CUSTOMIZED PC VENDORS.

DISTRIBUTORS AND RESELLERS

WE DISTRIBUTE OUR FINISHED GOODS PRODUCTS PRIMARILY THROUGH INDEPENDENT NON-EXCLUSIVE DISTRIBUTORS,

AUTHORIZED REPLICATORS, RESELLERS AND RETAIL OUTLETS. ORGANIZATIONS LICENSE OUR PRODUCTS PRIMARILY THROUGH LARGE ACCOUNT RESELLERS (LARS), DIRECT MARKET RESELLERS (DMRS), AND VALUE ADDED RESELLERS. MANY ORGANIZATIONS THAT LICENSE PRODUCTS THROUGH

ENTERPRISE AGREEMENTS (EAS) NOW TRANSACT DIRECTLY WITH US WITH SALES SUPPORT FROM OUR ENTERPRISE SOFTWARE ADVISOR CHANNEL PARTNERS. THESE ENTERPRISE SOFTWARE ADVISORS ARE ALSO TYPICALLY AUTHORIZED AS LARS AND OPERATE AS RESELLERS FOR OUR OTHER

LICENSING PROGRAMS. ALTHOUGH ALL OF OUR TYPES OF RESELLING PARTNERS REACH ORGANIZATIONS OF ALL SIZES, LARS ARE PRIMARILY ENGAGED WITH LARGE ORGANIZATIONS AND VALUE ADDED RESELLERS TYPICALLY REACH THE BREADTH OF SMALL AND MEDIUM SIZED ORGANIZATIONS.

SOME OF OUR DISTRIBUTORS INCLUDE INGRAM MICRO AND TECH DATA, AND SOME OF OUR LARGEST RESELLERS INCLUDE SOFTWARE SPECTRUM, SOFTWARE HOUSE INTERNATIONAL, DELL, CDW, AND INSIGHT ENTERPRISES. INDIVIDUAL CONSUMERS OBTAIN OUR PRODUCTS PRIMARILY THROUGH

RETAIL OUTLETS INCLUDING BEST BUY, WAL-MART, AND TARGET. WE HAVE A NETWORK OF FIELD SALES REPRESENTATIVES AND FIELD SUPPORT PERSONNEL WHO SOLICIT ORDERS FROM DISTRIBUTORS AND RESELLERS AND PROVIDE PRODUCT TRAINING AND SALES SUPPORT.

WE LICENSE SOFTWARE TO ORGANIZATIONS UNDER ARRANGEMENTS THAT ALLOW THE END-USER CUSTOMER TO ACQUIRE MULTIPLE LICENSES OF PRODUCT. THESE ARRANGEMENTS ARE DESIGNED TO

PROVIDE ORGANIZATIONS WITH A MEANS OF ACQUIRING MULTIPLE LICENSES, WITHOUT HAVING TO ACQUIRE SEPARATE PACKAGED PRODUCT THROUGH RETAIL CHANNELS. IN DELIVERING ORGANIZATIONAL LICENSING ARRANGEMENTS TO THE MARKET, WE USE DIFFERENT PROGRAMS DESIGNED TO

PROVIDE FLEXIBILITY FOR ORGANIZATIONS OF VARIOUS SIZES. WHILE THESE PROGRAMS MAY DIFFER IN VARIOUS PARTS OF THE WORLD, GENERALLY THEY ARE AS FOLLOWS.

OPEN.

TARGETED AT SMALL TO MEDIUM ORGANIZATIONS, THIS PROGRAM ALLOWS CUSTOMERS TO ACQUIRE PERPETUAL LICENSES AND, AT THE

CUSTOMERS ELECTION, RIGHTS TO FUTURE VERSIONS OF SOFTWARE PRODUCTS, OVER A SPECIFIED TIME PERIOD (GENERALLY TWO YEARS). THE OFFERING THAT CONVEYS RIGHTS TO FUTURE VERSIONS OF SOFTWARE PRODUCT IS CALLED SOFTWARE ASSURANCE. SOFTWARE ASSURANCE

ALSO PROVIDES SUPPORT, TOOLS, AND TRAINING TO HELP CUSTOMERS DEPLOY AND USE SOFTWARE EFFICIENTLY. UNDER THE OPEN PROGRAM, CUSTOMERS CAN ACQUIRE LICENSES ONLY OR LICENSES WITH SOFTWARE ASSURANCE. THEY CAN ALSO RENEW SOFTWARE ASSURANCE UPON THE

EXPIRATION OF EXISTING VOLUME LICENSING AGREEMENTS.

SELECT.

TARGETED AT MEDIUM TO LARGE ORGANIZATIONS, THIS PROGRAM ALLOWS CUSTOMERS TO ACQUIRE PERPETUAL LICENSES AND, AT THE CUSTOMERS ELECTION, SOFTWARE ASSURANCE, WHICH CONSISTS OF RIGHTS TO FUTURE

VERSIONS OF SOFTWARE PRODUCTS, SUPPORT, TOOLS, AND TRAINING, OVER A SPECIFIED TIME PERIOD (GENERALLY THREE YEARS). SIMILAR TO THE OPEN PROGRAM, CUSTOMERS CAN ACQUIRE LICENSES ONLY, ACQUIRE LICENSES WITH SOFTWARE ASSURANCE, OR RENEW SOFTWARE

ASSURANCE UPON THE EXPIRATION OF EXISTING VOLUME LICENSING AGREEMENTS.

ENTERPRISE AGREEMENT.

THE ENTERPRISE AGREEMENT IS TARGETED AT LARGE ORGANIZATIONS THAT WANT TO ACQUIRE PERPETUAL LICENSES TO SOFTWARE PRODUCTS FOR THEIR ENTIRE ENTERPRISE ALONG WITH RIGHTS TO FUTURE VERSIONS OF

SOFTWARE PRODUCTS OVER A THREE YEAR PERIOD.

PART I, ITEM 1

ENTERPRISE SUBSCRIPTION AGREEMENT.

THE ENTERPRISE

SUBSCRIPTION AGREEMENT (ESA) IS A TIME-BASED, MULTI-YEAR LICENSING ARRANGEMENT. UNDER AN ESA, CUSTOMERS ACQUIRE THE RIGHT TO USE THE CURRENT VERSION OF SOFTWARE PRODUCTS AND THE FUTURE VERSIONS THAT ARE RELEASED DURING THE THREE YEAR TERM OF THE

ARRANGEMENT. AT THE END OF THE ARRANGEMENT TERM, CUSTOMERS MAY EITHER RENEW THEIR ESA ARRANGEMENT OR EXERCISE A BUY-OUT OPTION TO OBTAIN PERPETUAL LICENSES FOR THE LATEST VERSION OF THE COVERED PRODUCTS. IF THEY DO NOT ELECT ONE OF THESE OPTIONS,

THEN ALL COVERED SOFTWARE MUST BE UNINSTALLED.

ONLINE SERVICES AND

PRODUCTS

WE DISTRIBUTE ONLINE CONTENT AND SERVICES THROUGH MSN SUBSCRIPTION

SERVICES, MSN NETWORK SERVICES, BCENTRAL SMALL BUSINESS PORTAL, AND OTHER ONLINE SERVICES. MSN SUBSCRIPTION SERVICES DELIVER INTERNET ACCESS AND OTHER PREMIUM SERVICES AND TOOLS TO CONSUMERS. MSN NETWORK SERVICES DELIVER ONLINE EMAIL AND MESSAGING

COMMUNICATION SERVICES AS WELL AS INFORMATION SERVICES SUCH AS ONLINE SEARCH AND PREMIUM CONTENT. THE BCENTRAL PORTAL PROVIDES TOOLS AND EXPERTISE FOR SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS TO BUILD, MARKET AND MANAGE THEIR BUSINESSES ONLINE. OTHER SERVICES

DELIVERED ONLINE INCLUDE MICROSOFT DEVELOPER NETWORKS (MSDN) SUBSCRIPTION CONTENT AND UPDATES, PERIODIC PRODUCT UPDATES, AND ONLINE TECHNICAL AND PRACTICE READINESS RESOURCES TO SUPPORT OUR PARTNERS IN DEVELOPING AND SELLING MICROSOFT PRODUCTS AND

SOLUTIONS.

CUSTOMERS

OUR CUSTOMERS INCLUDE INDIVIDUAL CONSUMERS, SMALL- AND MEDIUM-SIZE ORGANIZATIONS, ENTERPRISES,

GOVERNMENTAL INSTITUTIONS, EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS, INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDERS, APPLICATION DEVELOPERS, AND OEMS. CONSUMERS AND SMALL- AND MEDIUM-SIZE ORGANIZATIONS OBTAIN MICROSOFT PRODUCTS PRIMARILY THROUGH RESELLERS AND OEMS. NO SINGLE CUSTOMER

ACCOUNTED FOR 10% OR MORE OF REVENUE IN 2001, 2002, OR 2003. OUR PRACTICE IS TO SHIP OUR PRODUCTS PROMPTLY UPON RECEIPT OF PURCHASE ORDERS FROM CUSTOMERS; CONSEQUENTLY, BACKLOG IS NOT SIGNIFICANT.

COMPETITION

THE SOFTWARE BUSINESS IS INTENSELY COMPETITIVE AND SUBJECT TO RAPID TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE, EVOLVING CUSTOMER REQUIREMENTS, AND CHANGING BUSINESS

MODELS. WE FACE SIGNIFICANT COMPETITION IN ALL AREAS OF OUR CURRENT BUSINESS ACTIVITIES. THE RAPID PACE OF TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE CONTINUALLY CREATES NEW OPPORTUNITIES FOR EXISTING COMPETITORS AND START-UPS AND CAN QUICKLY RENDER EXISTING TECHNOLOGIES

LESS VALUABLE. CUSTOMER REQUIREMENTS AND PREFERENCES CONTINUALLY CHANGE AS OTHER INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES EMERGE OR BECOME LESS EXPENSIVE, AND AS EMERGING CONCERNS SUCH AS SECURITY AND PRIVACY BECOME OF PARAMOUNT CONCERN. WE FACE DIRECT COMPETITION

WITH FIRMS ADOPTING ALTERNATIVE BUSINESS MODELS TO THE COMMERCIAL SOFTWARE MODEL. FIRMS ADOPTING THE OPEN SOURCE MODEL TYPICALLY PROVIDE CUSTOMERS WITH OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE AT NOMINAL COST AND EARN REVENUE ON COMPLIMENTARY SERVICES AND PRODUCTS,

WITHOUT HAVING TO BEAR THE FULL COSTS OF RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT FOR THE OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE. ADDITIONALLY, GLOBAL SOFTWARE PIRACY  THE UNLAWFUL COPYING AND DISTRIBUTION OF OUR COPYRIGHTED SOFTWARE PRODUCTS  DEPRIVES US OF LARGE

AMOUNTS OF REVENUE ON AN ANNUAL BASIS. FURTHER, THE EXISTING VERSIONS OF OUR PRODUCTS LICENSED TO OUR INSTALLED BASE OF USERS COMPETE WITH FUTURE VERSIONS. THIS MEANS THAT FUTURE VERSIONS MUST DELIVER SIGNIFICANT ADDITIONAL VALUE IN ORDER TO INDUCE

EXISTING CUSTOMERS TO PURCHASE A NEW VERSION OF OUR PRODUCT.

OUR COMPETITIVE POSITION MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED IN THE FUTURE BY ONE OR MORE OF THE

FACTORS DESCRIBED IN THIS SECTION.

CLIENT

ALTHOUGH WE ARE THE LEADER IN OPERATING SYSTEM SOFTWARE PRODUCTS, WE FACE STRONG COMPETITION FROM WELL

ESTABLISHED COMPANIES AND ENTITIES WITH DIFFERING APPROACHES TO THE MARKET. COMPETING COMMERCIAL SOFTWARE PRODUCTS, INCLUDING VARIANTS OF UNIX, ARE SUPPLIED BY COMPETITORS, SUCH AS IBM, HEWLETT-PACKARD, APPLE COMPUTER, SUN MICROSYSTEMS AND OTHERS,

WHO ARE VERTICALLY INTEGRATED IN BOTH SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT AND HARDWARE MANUFACTURING AND HAVE DEVELOPED OPERATING SYSTEMS THAT THEY PREINSTALL ON THEIR OWN COMPUTERS. PERSONAL COMPUTER OEMS WHO PREINSTALL THIRD PARTY OPERATING SYSTEMS MAY ALSO

LICENSE THESE FIRMS OPERATING SYSTEMS OR OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE, ESPECIALLY OFFERINGS BASED ON LINUX. VARIANTS OF UNIX RUN ON A WIDE VARIETY OF COMPUTER PLATFORMS AND HAVE GAINED INCREASING ACCEPTANCE AS DESKTOP OPERATING SYSTEMS, IN PART DUE TO

THE INCREASING PERFORMANCE OF STANDARD HARDWARE COMPONENTS AT DECREASING PRICES. THE LINUX OPEN SOURCE OPERATING SYSTEM, WHICH IS ALSO DERIVED FROM UNIX AND IS AVAILABLE WITHOUT PAYMENT UNDER A GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE, HAS GAINED INCREASING

ACCEPTANCE AS ITS FEATURE SET INCREASINGLY RESEMBLES THE DISTINCT AND INNOVATIVE FEATURES OF WINDOWS AND AS COMPETITIVE PRESSURES ON PERSONAL COMPUTER OEMS TO REDUCE COSTS CONTINUE TO INCREASE. THE MICROSOFT WINDOWS OPERATING SYSTEMS ALSO FACE

COMPETITION FROM ALTERNATIVE PLATFORMS SUCH AS THOSE BASED ON INTERNET BROWSING SOFTWARE AND JAVA TECHNOLOGY PROMOTED BY SUN MICROSYSTEMS, AS WELL AS INNOVATIVE FORM FACTORS THAT MAY REDUCE CONSUMER DEMAND FOR TRADITIONAL PERSONAL COMPUTERS. WE

BELIEVE OUR OPERATING SYSTEM PRODUCTS COMPETE EFFECTIVELY BY DELIVERING BETTER INNOVATION, OVERALL VALUE, AN EASY-TO-USE INTERFACE, COMPATIBILITY WITH A BROAD RANGE OF HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE APPLICATIONS, AND THE LARGEST SUPPORT NETWORK FOR ANY

OPERATING SYSTEM.

SERVER AND TOOLS

OUR SERVER OPERATING SYSTEM PRODUCTS FACE INTENSE COMPETITION FROM A WIDE VARIETY OF COMPETING SERVER

OPERATING SYSTEMS AND SERVER APPLICATIONS OFFERED BY FIRMS WITH A VARIETY OF MARKET APPROACHES. SEVERAL VERTICALLY INTEGRATED COMPUTER MANUFACTURERS, SUCH AS IBM, HEWLETT-PACKARD, APPLE COMPUTER, SUN MICROSYSTEMS AND OTHERS OFFER THEIR OWN VARIANT

OF UNIX PREINSTALLED ON SERVER HARDWARE, AND VIRTUALLY ALL COMPUTER MANUFACTURERS OFFER SERVER HARDWARE FOR THE LINUX OPERATING SYSTEM. IBMS ENDORSEMENT OF LINUX HAS ACCELERATED ITS ACCEPTANCE AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO BOTH TRADITIONAL UNIX AND

WINDOWS SERVER OPERATING SYSTEMS. LINUXS COMPETITIVE POSITION HAS ALSO BENEFITED FROM THE LARGE NUMBER OF COMPATIBLE APPLICATIONS NOW PRODUCED BY MANY LEADING COMMERCIAL SOFTWARE DEVELOPERS AS WELL AS OPEN SOURCE COMMUNITY DEVELOPERS. A NUMBER

OF COMPANIES SUPPLY VERSIONS OF LINUX, INCLUDING RED HAT AND VA LINUX.

WE COMPETE IN THE BUSINESS OF PROVIDING ENTERPRISE-WIDE COMPUTING SOLUTIONS

WITH SEVERAL COMPANIES THAT PROVIDE COMPETING SOLUTIONS AS WELL AS MIDDLEWARE TECHNOLOGY PLATFORMS. IBM AND SUN MICROSYSTEMS LEAD A GROUP OF COMPANIES FOCUSED ON THE JAVA 2 PLATFORM ENTERPRISE EDITION (J2EE). COMMERCIAL SOFTWARE DEVELOPERS THAT

PROVIDE COMPETING SERVER APPLICATIONS FOR THE PC-BASED

PART I, ITEM 1

DISTRIBUTED CLIENT/SERVER ENVIRONMENTS INCLUDE ORACLE, IBM, COMPUTER ASSOCIATES, SYBASE, AND INFORMIX. THERE ARE ALSO A NUMBER OF OPEN SOURCE SERVER APPLICATIONS

AVAILABLE.

NUMEROUS COMMERCIAL SOFTWARE VENDORS OFFER COMPETING COMMERCIAL SOFTWARE APPLICATIONS FOR CONNECTIVITY (BOTH INTERNET AND INTRANET),

SECURITY, HOSTING, AND E-BUSINESS SERVERS. ADDITIONALLY, IBM HAS A LARGE INSTALLED BASE OF LOTUS NOTES AND CC:MAIL, BOTH OF WHICH COMPETE WITH OUR COLLABORATION AND EMAIL PRODUCTS. THERE ARE ALSO A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE PRODUCTS

THAT COMPETE WITH MICROSOFT SOLUTIONS, INCLUDING APACHE WEB SERVER.

THE OPEN SOURCE MODEL OF LINUX AND OTHER SERVER PROGRAMS ENABLES BOTH SERVICES

AND HARDWARE COMPANIES TO PROVIDE CUSTOMERS WITH OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE AT NOMINAL COST AND EARN REVENUE ON COMPLIMENTARY SERVICES AND PRODUCTS, WITHOUT HAVING TO BEAR THE FULL COSTS OF RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT FOR THE OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE. FOR

EXAMPLE, IBM, WITH THE LARGEST HARDWARE AND SERVICES BUSINESSES IN THE INDUSTRY, PROMOTES LINUX EXTENSIVELY AND SEEKS TO EARN REVENUES AND PROFITS ON THE SALE OF ITS CONSULTING SERVICES TO IMPLEMENT THE LINUX SERVER SOLUTION AS WELL AS RELATED

HARDWARE AND COMMERCIAL SOFTWARE PRODUCTS THAT RUN ON LINUX.

OUR DEVELOPER PRODUCTS COMPETE AGAINST OFFERINGS FROM BEA SYSTEMS, BORLAND, IBM,

MACROMEDIA, ORACLE, SUN MICROSYSTEMS, SYBASE, AND OTHER COMPANIES.

WE BELIEVE THAT OUR SERVER PRODUCTS PROVIDE CUSTOMERS WITH SIGNIFICANT ADVANTAGES

IN INNOVATION, PERFORMANCE (BOTH RELATIVE TO TOTAL COSTS OF OWNERSHIP AND IN ABSOLUTE TERMS), PRODUCTIVITY, APPLICATIONS DEVELOPMENT TOOLS AND ENVIRONMENT, COMPATIBILITY WITH A BROAD BASE OF HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE APPLICATIONS, SECURITY, AND

MANAGEABILITY.

INFORMATION WORKER

WHILE WE ARE THE LEADER IN BUSINESS PRODUCTIVITY SOFTWARE APPLICATIONS, COMPETITORS TO

THE MICROSOFT OFFICE SYSTEM INCLUDE MANY SOFTWARE APPLICATION VENDORS, SUCH AS APPLE, COREL, IBM, ORACLE, QUALCOMM, SUN MICROSYSTEMS, AND LOCAL APPLICATION DEVELOPERS IN EUROPE AND ASIA. IBM AND COREL HAVE SIGNIFICANT INSTALLED BASES WITH THEIR

SPREADSHEET AND WORD PROCESSOR PRODUCTS, RESPECTIVELY, AND BOTH HAVE AGGRESSIVE PRICING STRATEGIES. ALSO, APPLE AND IBM PREINSTALL CERTAIN OF THEIR APPLICATION SOFTWARE PRODUCTS ON VARIOUS MODELS OF THEIR PCS, COMPETING DIRECTLY WITH OUR

APPLICATIONS. CORELS SUITE AND SUN MICROSYSTEMS STAR OFFICE ARE AGGRESSIVELY PRICED AND ATTRACTIVE FOR OEMS TO PRE-INSTALL ON LOW-PRICED PCS. THE OPENOFFICE.ORG PROJECT PROVIDES A FREELY DOWNLOADABLE CROSS-PLATFORM APPLICATION THAT IS

GAINING POPULARITY IN CERTAIN MARKET SEGMENTS. IN ADDITION TO TRADITIONAL CLIENT-SIDE APPLICATIONS, WEB-BASED APPLICATIONS HOSTING SERVICES SUCH AS SIMDESK PROVIDE AN ALTERNATIVE TO MICROSOFT OFFICE AND ARE GAINING SOME SUPPORT. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR

PRODUCTS COMPETE EFFECTIVELY BY PROVIDING CUSTOMERS SIGNIFICANT BENEFITS, SUCH AS EASY-TO-USE PERSONAL PRODUCTIVITY, SUPPORT FOR EFFECTIVE TEAMING AND COLLABORATION, AND BETTER INFORMATION MANAGEMENT AND CONTROL.

MICROSOFT BUSINESS SOLUTIONS

THE SMALL AND MID-MARKET BUSINESS APPLICATIONS MARKET GLOBALLY IS HIGHLY FRAGMENTED AND IS INTENSELY

COMPETITIVE IN ALL SECTORS. WE FACE COMPETITION FROM A LARGE NUMBER OF COMPANIES IN THIS BUSINESS. WELL-KNOWN VENDORS FOCUSED ON SMALL AND MID-MARKET BUSINESS, SUCH AS INTUIT AND SAGE, COMPETE AGAINST US FOR A PORTION OF THIS SEGMENT. IN ADDITION,

LARGE-ENTERPRISE FOCUSED VENDORS, SUCH AS ORACLE, PEOPLESOFT AND SAP, ALSO COMPETE AGAINST US FOR A PORTION OF THIS SEGMENT. HOWEVER, THE COMPETITION FOR A SIGNIFICANT MAJORITY OF THE TOTAL BUSINESS APPLICATIONS MARKET INCLUDES THOUSANDS OF MUCH

SMALLER VENDORS IN SPECIFIC LOCALITIES OR INDUSTRIES WHO OFFER THEIR OWN ENTERPRISE RESOURCE PLANNING, CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIP MANAGEMENT, AND/OR ANALYTIC SOLUTIONS.

MSN

MSN COMPETES WITH AOL-TIME WARNER, GOOGLE, YAHOO!, AND A VAST ARRAY OF WEB SITES AND PORTALS THAT OFFER CONTENT OF ALL TYPES, SUCH AS EMAIL, INSTANT MESSAGING, CALENDARING, CHAT,

SEARCH, AND SHOPPING SERVICES. AS THE BROADBAND ACCESS MARKET GROWS, WE EXPECT TO HAVE INCREASING OPPORTUNITY TO DELIVER PREMIUM SUBSCRIPTION SERVICES FOR CONSUMERS. AOL AND YAHOO! ARE BOTH PURSUING SIMILAR STRATEGIES AND WILL BE COMPETITORS IN THIS

EMERGING CATEGORY. WHILE THE MOVEMENT TO BROADBAND ACCESS MAY CAUSE OUR INTERNET ACCESS DIAL-UP BUSINESS TO CONTINUE TO DECLINE, WE WILL STRIVE TO CONVERT CUSTOMERS TO MSN PREMIUM SUBSCRIPTION SERVICES VIA PARTNERSHIPS WITH NETWORK PROVIDERS AND

INTERNET SOFTWARE SERVICES OFFERED DIRECTLY FROM MSN. WE BELIEVE OUR STRENGTHS ARE OUR HERITAGE OF TECHNOLOGY INNOVATION, PARTICULARLY IN COMMUNICATION SERVICES, DISTRIBUTION PARTNERSHIPS, AND THE LARGE BASE OF USERS OF OUR FREE MSN NETWORK.

ADDITIONALLY, WHILE OUR ADVERTISING BUSINESS HAS GROWN CONSIDERABLY OVER THE LAST YEAR, EVOLVING MARKET CONDITIONS, PARTICULARLY PAID SEARCH, WILL IMPACT OUR STRATEGY OVER THE NEXT YEAR. WE CURRENTLY ARE BUILDING OUR OWN SEARCH ENGINE AND INVESTING

TO SUPPORT THE CONTINUED GROWTH OF OUR ADVERTISING BUSINESS.

MOBILE AND EMBEDDED

DEVICES

WINDOWS MOBILE SOFTWARE FACES SUBSTANTIAL COMPETITION FROM NOKIA,

OPENWAVE SYSTEMS, PALMSOURCE, QUALCOMM, AND SYMBIAN. THE EMBEDDED OPERATING SYSTEM MARKET IS HIGHLY FRAGMENTED WITH MANY COMPETITIVE OFFERINGS. KEY COMPETITORS INCLUDE IBM, WIND RIVER, AND VERSIONS OF EMBEDDABLE LINUX FROM COMMERCIAL LINUX VENDORS,

SUCH AS METROWERKS AND MONTAVISTA SOFTWARE. MAPPOINT COMPETITORS INCLUDE DELORME, MAPINFO, MAPQUEST.COM, RAND MCNALLY, WEBRASKA MOBILE TECHNOLOGIES, AND YAHOO!. THE TELEMATICS MARKET IS ALSO HIGHLY FRAGMENTED, WITH COMPETITIVE OFFERINGS FROM IBM AND

AUTOMOTIVE SUPPLIERS BUILDING ON VARIOUS REAL-TIME OPERATING SYSTEM PLATFORMS FROM COMMERCIAL LINUX VENDORS, QNX SOFTWARE SYSTEMS, WIND RIVER, AND OTHERS.

HOME AND ENTERTAINMENT

THE HOME AND ENTERTAINMENT BUSINESS IS HIGHLY COMPETITIVE AND IS CHARACTERIZED BY LIMITED PLATFORM LIFE CYCLES, FREQUENT INTRODUCTIONS OF NEW PRODUCTS AND TITLES, AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW TECHNOLOGIES. THE MARKETS FOR OUR

PRODUCTS ARE CHARACTERIZED BY SIGNIFICANT PRICE COMPETITION, AND WE ANTICIPATE CONTINUED PRICING PRESSURE FROM OUR COMPETITORS. THESE PRESSURES HAVE, FROM TIME TO TIME, REQUIRED US TO REDUCE PRICES ON CERTAIN PRODUCTS. OUR COMPETITORS VARY IN SIZE

FROM VERY SMALL COMPANIES WITH LIMITED RESOURCES TO VERY LARGE, DIVERSIFIED CORPORATIONS WITH SUBSTANTIAL FINANCIAL AND MARKETING RESOURCES. WE COMPETE PRIMARILY ON THE BASIS OF PRICE, PRODUCT QUALITY AND VARIETY, TIMING OF PRODUCT RELEASES, AND

EFFECTIVENESS OF DISTRIBUTION AND MARKETING.

PART I, ITEM 1, 2, 3, 4

OUR XBOX HARDWARE BUSINESS COMPETES WITH CONSOLE PLATFORMS FROM NINTENDO AND SONY,

BOTH OF WHICH HAVE A LARGE ESTABLISHED BASE OF USERS. IN ADDITION TO COMPETING AGAINST SOFTWARE PUBLISHED FOR NON-XBOX PLATFORMS, OUR GAMES BUSINESS ALSO COMPETES WITH NUMEROUS COMPANIES THAT HAVE BEEN LICENSED BY MICROSOFT TO DEVELOP AND PUBLISH

SOFTWARE FOR THE XBOX CONSOLE. THESE COMPETITORS INCLUDE ACCLAIM ENTERTAINMENT, ACTIVISION, ATARI, CAPCOM, EIDOS, ELECTRONIC ARTS, SEGA, TAKE-TWO INTERACTIVE, TECMO, THQ, AND UBI SOFT, AMONG OTHERS. SUCCESS IN THE GAMES BUSINESS IS INCREASINGLY

DRIVEN BY HIT TITLES, WHICH ARE DIFFICULT TO DEVELOP AND REQUIRE SUBSTANTIAL INVESTMENTS IN DEVELOPMENT AND MARKETING. IN ADDITION, OTHER FORMS OF ENTERTAINMENT, SUCH AS MUSIC, MOTION PICTURES, AND TELEVISION, COMPETE AGAINST OUR ENTERTAINMENT

SOFTWARE FOR CONSUMER SPENDING. OUR PC HARDWARE PRODUCTS FACE AGGRESSIVE COMPETITION FROM COMPUTER AND OTHER HARDWARE MANUFACTURERS, MANY OF WHICH ARE ALSO CURRENT OR POTENTIAL PARTNERS.

EMPLOYEES

AS OF JUNE 30, 2003, WE EMPLOYED APPROXIMATELY 55,000 PEOPLE ON A FULL-TIME BASIS, 36,500 IN THE UNITED STATES AND 18,500 INTERNATIONALLY. OF THE TOTAL, 23,200 WERE IN PRODUCT

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, 25,100 IN SALES, MARKETING, AND SUPPORT, 2,400 IN MANUFACTURING AND DISTRIBUTION, AND 4,300 IN FINANCE AND ADMINISTRATION. OUR SUCCESS IS HIGHLY DEPENDENT ON OUR ABILITY TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN QUALIFIED EMPLOYEES.

COMPETITION FOR EMPLOYEES IS INTENSE IN THE SOFTWARE INDUSTRY. WE BELIEVE WE HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN OUR EFFORTS TO RECRUIT QUALIFIED EMPLOYEES, BUT WE CANNOT GUARANTEE THAT WE WILL CONTINUE TO BE AS SUCCESSFUL IN THE FUTURE. NONE OF OUR EMPLOYEES

ARE SUBJECT TO COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENTS. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR RELATIONS WITH OUR EMPLOYEES ARE EXCELLENT.

IN JANUARY 2003, OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS DECLARED OUR FIRST ANNUAL COMMON STOCK DIVIDEND, OF $0.08 PER SHARE, WHICH WAS PAID IN MARCH 2003. OUR DIVIDEND POLICY IS IMPACTED BY, AMONG

OTHER ITEMS, OUR VIEWS ON POTENTIAL FUTURE CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS RELATING TO RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, CREATION AND EXPANSION OF SALES DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS, INVESTMENTS AND ACQUISITIONS, SHARE DILUTION MANAGEMENT, LEGAL RISKS, AND CHALLENGES TO OUR

BUSINESS MODEL.

IN CONNECTION WITH MICROSOFTS ACQUISITION OF NAVISION A/S, PURSUANT TO A VOLUNTARY OFFER TO ACQUIRE ALL NAVISION ORDINARY

SHARES, MICROSOFT ISSUED 29.1 MILLION SHARES OF ITS COMMON STOCK TO NAVISION SHAREHOLDERS ON JULY 12, 2002, IN EXCHANGE FOR 19.4 MILLION NAVISION ORDINARY SHARES, NOMINAL VALUE DKK 1 PER SHARE. THE PRICE PAID BY MICROSOFT IN CONNECTION WITH THE

OFFER WAS DKK 300 PER EACH NAVISION SHARE, PAYABLE AT EACH NAVISION SHAREHOLDERS ELECTION IN EITHER CASH OR MICROSOFT SHARES, ON THE BASIS OF AN EXCHANGE RATIO OF 1.49982 SHARES OF MICROSOFT COMMON STOCK FOR EACH NAVISION ORDINARY SHARE. THESE

REVENUE

OUR REVENUE GROWTH RATE WAS 10% IN FISCAL 2001, 12% IN FISCAL 2002, AND 13% IN FISCAL 2003. REVENUE GROWTH IN FISCAL 2003 WAS DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY

MULTI-YEAR LICENSING THAT OCCURRED BEFORE THE TRANSITION TO OUR NEW LICENSING PROGRAM (LICENSING 6.0) IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2003. PRIOR TO THE JULY 31, 2002 TRANSITION DATE TO LICENSING 6.0, WE EXPERIENCED SIGNIFICANT GROWTH IN MULTI-YEAR

LICENSING ARRANGEMENTS AS CUSTOMERS ENROLLED IN OUR MAINTENANCE PROGRAMS, INCLUDING UPGRADE ADVANTAGE AND SOFTWARE ASSURANCE. THE REVENUE GROWTH ALSO REFLECTED A $933 MILLION OR 13% INCREASE ASSOCIATED WITH OEM LICENSING OF MICROSOFT WINDOWS

OPERATING SYSTEMS AND A $309 MILLION OR 23% INCREASE IN REVENUE FROM MICROSOFT XBOX VIDEO GAME CONSOLES. REVENUE GROWTH IN FISCAL 2002 WAS LED BY THE ADDITION OF $1.35 BILLION OF XBOX VIDEO GAME SYSTEM REVENUE AND $1.20 BILLION OF REVENUE GROWTH

FROM MICROSOFT WINDOWS XP PROFESSIONAL AND HOME OPERATING SYSTEMS. REVENUE GROWTH IN FISCAL 2001 WAS DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY LICENSING OF MICROSOFT WINDOWS 2000 PROFESSIONAL WITH $1.01 BILLION GROWTH IN REVENUE FROM PROFESSIONAL OPERATING SYSTEMS, AND

SERVER AND TOOLS REVENUE GROWTH OF $852 MILLION.

DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2002, WE LAUNCHED A NEW LICENSING PROGRAM, LICENSING 6.0, FOR

VOLUME LICENSING CUSTOMERS. LICENSING 6.0 SIMPLIFIES AND IMPROVES OUR VOLUME LICENSING PROGRAM WITH SOFTWARE ASSURANCE, WHICH GIVES CUSTOMERS THE RIGHT TO INSTALL ANY NEW RELEASE OF PRODUCTS COVERED IN THE LICENSING AGREEMENT DURING THE TERM OF

THEIR COVERAGE. THE LEVEL OF CUSTOMER ADOPTION OF OUR NEW VOLUME LICENSING PROGRAMS WILL AFFECT THE MIX OF MULTI-YEAR LICENSING AGREEMENTS WITH A RESULTING IMPACT ON THE TIMING OF REVENUE RECOGNITION. IN ADDITION, THE TIMING AND EXTENT OF A RECOVERY

IN CONSUMER AND CORPORATE SPENDING ON PCS AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY WILL BE FACTORS AFFECTING REVENUE GROWTH.

CONSOLIDATED OPERATING INCOME

OPERATING INCOME GREW 6% IN

FISCAL 2001, 2% IN FISCAL 2002, AND 11% IN FISCAL 2003. IN FISCAL 2003, THE GROWTH IN OPERATING INCOME REFLECTED AN INCREASE OF $3.82 BILLION IN REVENUE, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE OF $2.52 BILLION IN OPERATING EXPENSES, PRIMARILY RELATED TO

EMPLOYEE AND RELATED COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH ADDITIONAL HEADCOUNT AND INCREASED LEGAL SETTLEMENT EXPENSES. IN FISCAL 2002, THE GROWTH IN OPERATING INCOME REFLECTED AN INCREASE OF $3.07 BILLION IN REVENUE, SUBSTANTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE OF $2.88

BILLION IN OPERATING EXPENSES, WHICH INCLUDED THE ONSET OF COSTS RELATED TO XBOX VIDEO GAME SYSTEMS. IN FISCAL 2001, THE GROWTH IN OPERATING INCOME REFLECTED AN INCREASE OF $2.34 BILLION IN REVENUE, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE OF $1.63 BILLION

IN OPERATING EXPENSES.

CLIENT

CLIENT REVENUE WAS $8.17 BILLION, $9.36 BILLION, AND $10.39 BILLION IN 2001, 2002, AND 2003. CLIENT

INCLUDES REVENUE FROM WINDOWS XP PROFESSIONAL AND HOME, WINDOWS 2000 PROFESSIONAL, AND OTHER STANDARD WINDOWS OPERATING SYSTEMS. IN 2003, CLIENT REVENUE GROWTH WAS DRIVEN BY OEM LICENSING REVENUE GROWTH OF $933 MILLION AND A 9 PERCENTAGE POINT

INCREASE OF THE MIX OF THE HIGHER PRICED WINDOWS PROFESSIONAL OPERATING SYSTEMS, THE MAJORITY OF WHICH WAS IN THE OEM CHANNEL. WINDOWS PROFESSIONAL REVENUE GROWTH FOR FISCAL 2003 WAS $1.59 BILLION OR 31% COMPARED TO FISCAL 2002, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY

A $573 MILLION DECLINE IN REVENUE OF

EARLIER VERSIONS OF WINDOWS OPERATING SYSTEMS. CLIENT OPERATING PROFIT FOR FISCAL 2003 INCREASED 11% PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF THE 11% GROWTH IN REVENUE, PARTIALLY

OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN OPERATING EXPENSES, LARGELY ATTRIBUTED TO HEADCOUNT ADDITIONS AND RELATED COSTS.

IN FISCAL 2002, THE GROWTH IN CLIENT

REVENUE REFLECTED STRONG MULTI-YEAR LICENSING REVENUE GROWTH AND A CONTINUED SHIFT OF SALES TO THE HIGHER PRICED WINDOWS 2000 AND WINDOWS XP PROFESSIONAL OPERATING SYSTEM LICENSED THROUGH OEMS. OEM REVENUE GREW $939 MILLION, DESPITE A 5% DECLINE IN

REPORTED OEM UNIT SHIPMENTS. FISCAL 2001 REVENUE GROWTH REFLECTED THE STRONG ADOPTION OF WINDOWS 2000 PROFESSIONAL WITH PROFESSIONAL OPERATING SYSTEMS REVENUE GROWTH OF $1.01 BILLION AND A 7 PERCENTAGE POINT MIX INCREASE TO THE HIGHER PRICED WINDOWS

2000 PROFESSIONAL AND WINDOWS NT WORKSTATION OPERATING SYSTEMS, AND A $91 MILLION INCREASE IN REVENUE FROM WINDOWS ME AND WINDOWS 98 OPERATING SYSTEMS.

WE DO NOT EXPECT THE REVENUE GROWTH ATTRIBUTED TO THE MIX TOWARD THE HIGHER PRICED WINDOWS PROFESSIONAL OPERATING SYSTEM TO CONTINUE AT PREVIOUS LEVELS INTO FISCAL 2004. ADDITIONALLY, VARIABILITY BETWEEN THE REPORTED OEM UNIT SHIPMENTS AND

THE UNDERLYING PC MARKET MAY CONTINUE AS A RESULT OF THE TRANSITION TO NEW OEM LICENSING TERMS AT THE BEGINNING OF FISCAL YEAR 2003, UNDER WHICH OEMS ARE BILLED UPON THEIR ACQUISITION OF CERTIFICATES OF AUTHENTICITY (COAS) RATHER THAN UPON THE

SHIPMENT OF PCS TO THEIR CUSTOMERS.

TOTAL OF PROJECT, VISIO, AND OTHER STANDALONE APPLICATIONS. INFORMATION WORKER OPERATING PROFIT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2003 GREW 9% COMPARED TO FISCAL YEAR 2002 LED BY THE 12% INCREASE IN REVENUE, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A 24% GROWTH IN OPERATING EXPENSES

RELATED TO HEADCOUNT ADDITIONS AND MARKETING EXPENSES.

IN FISCAL 2002, INFORMATION WORKER LICENSING REVENUE DECLINED $228 MILLION OR 3% DURING THE

YEAR DUE TO A SHIFT IN THE SALES MIX TO MULTI-YEAR LICENSING AGREEMENTS, WHICH DEFERRED REVENUE RECOGNITION TO FUTURE YEARS, AND A $294 MILLION OR 14% DECREASE IN CONSUMER PURCHASES IN THE ASIA-PACIFIC REGION, MOST NOTABLY JAPAN, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY

ALTHOUGH TOTAL MSN SUBSCRIBERS AT THE END OF FISCAL 2003 WERE FLAT COMPARED TO THE END OF FISCAL 2002, MSN SUBSCRIPTIONS REVENUE GREW $112 MILLION OR 11% IN FISCAL YEAR 2003 REFLECTING AN INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF NON-PROMOTION SUBSCRIBERS. MSN

NETWORK SERVICES REVENUE GREW $270 MILLION OR 48% IN FISCAL 2003 AS A RESULT OF GROWTH IN PAID SEARCH AND STRONG GENERAL ADVERTISING SALES ACROSS ALL GEOGRAPHIC REGIONS. MSN OPERATING LOSS FOR FISCAL 2003 DECREASED 53%, PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF THE

GROWTH IN REVENUE AND LOWER RELATIVE SUBSCRIPTION ACQUISITION AND SUPPORT COSTS.

IN FISCAL 2002, MSN SUBSCRIPTIONS REVENUE INCREASED $229 MILLION OR

29% AS A RESULT OF BOTH A HIGHER SUBSCRIBER BASE AND HIGHER AVERAGE REVENUE PER SUBSCRIBER DUE TO A REDUCTION IN PROMOTIONAL SUBSCRIBER PROGRAMS. REVENUE FROM MSN NETWORK SERVICES INCREASED $27 MILLION OR 5% LED BY ONLINE ADVERTISING. IN FISCAL

DEVICES HAVE BEEN RESTATED TO REFLECT THE REORGANIZATIONS OF MAPPOINT FROM INFORMATION WORKER AND WINDOWS EMBEDDED DEVICE OPERATING SYSTEMS FROM CLIENT TO MOBILE AND EMBEDDED DEVICES.

HOME AND ENTERTAINMENT

HOME AND ENTERTAINMENT REVENUE WAS $1.14 BILLION, $2.45 BILLION, AND $2.75 BILLION IN 2001, 2002, AND 2003. HOME & ENTERTAINMENT INCLUDES THE XBOX VIDEO GAME SYSTEM, PC GAMES,

23% IN FISCAL 2003 REFLECTING A $779 MILLION INCREASE FROM HIGHER VOLUMES FOR XBOX CONSOLES, GAMES, AND PERIPHERALS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A $470 MILLION DECREASE DUE TO PRICE CHANGES. REVENUE FROM CONSUMER HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE AND PC GAMES DECLINED

$14 MILLION OR 1% IN FISCAL 2003. OPERATING LOSS FOR FISCAL 2003 INCREASED 6% FROM THE PRIOR YEAR AS THE PRODUCT COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE INCREASED XBOX CONSOLE SALES AND INCREASED MARKETING EXPENSE MORE THAN OFFSET THE 12% INCREASE IN REVENUE.

FISCAL 2002. LEARNING AND PRODUCTIVITY SOFTWARE REVENUE AND PC AND ONLINE GAMES DECLINED $39 MILLION OR 3% IN FISCAL 2002 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2001. IN FISCAL 2001, HOME AND ENTERTAINMENT REVENUE DECLINED $214 MILLION OR 16% FROM FISCAL 2002.

OTHER

REVENUE IN THE OTHER SEGMENT REPRESENTS OUR MAJORITY OWNERSHIP OF EXPEDIA, INC., WHICH WAS SOLD IN FEBRUARY 2002, RESULTING IN A DECLINE IN REVENUE

FROM FISCAL 2001. ACQUISITIONS OF TRAVELSCAPE.COM AND VACATIONSPOT.COM BY EXPEDIA, INC. IN FISCAL 2001 AND INCREASED PRODUCT OFFERINGS FROM EXPEDIA LED TO THE STRONG REVENUE GROWTH IN FISCAL 2001.

FOREIGN CURRENCIES IMPACT

OUR OPERATING RESULTS ARE AFFECTED BY FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES. APPROXIMATELY 27%, 25%, AND 28% OF OUR REVENUE WAS COLLECTED IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES

DURING 2001, 2002, AND 2003. HAD THE RATES FROM FISCAL 2002 BEEN IN EFFECT IN FISCAL 2003, TRANSLATED INTERNATIONAL REVENUE BILLED IN LOCAL CURRENCIES WOULD HAVE BEEN APPROXIMATELY $700 MILLION LOWER. CERTAIN MANUFACTURING, SELLING DISTRIBUTION AND

SUPPORT COSTS ARE DISBURSED IN LOCAL CURRENCIES, AND A PORTION OF INTERNATIONAL REVENUE IS HEDGED, THUS OFFSETTING A PORTION OF THE TRANSLATION EXPOSURE.

OPERATING EXPENSES

COST OF REVENUE

COST OF REVENUE INCLUDES MANUFACTURING AND

DISTRIBUTION COSTS FOR PRODUCTS AND PROGRAMS SOLD, OPERATION COSTS RELATED TO PRODUCT SUPPORT SERVICE CENTERS AND PRODUCT DISTRIBUTION CENTERS, COSTS INCURRED TO SUPPORT AND MAINTAIN INTERNET-BASED PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, AND COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH

THE DELIVERY OF CONSULTING SERVICES. COST OF REVENUE AS A PERCENT OF REVENUE WAS 13.7% IN 2001, 18.3% IN 2002, AND 17.7% IN 2003. FOR FISCAL 2003, COST OF REVENUE WAS $5.69 BILLION COMPARED TO $5.19 BILLION IN FISCAL 2002. THE PRIMARY DRIVER OF THE

DECREASE AS A PERCENTAGE OF REVENUE IN FISCAL 2003 WAS A 0.2 PERCENTAGE POINT DECREASE FROM HOME AND ENTERTAINMENT PRODUCTS DUE TO LOWER VOLUMES AND IMPROVED MARGINS OF XBOX VIDEO GAME CONSOLES AND A 0.4 PERCENTAGE POINT DECREASE FROM MSN PRODUCT

AND SERVICE COSTS IN FISCAL 2003 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2002.

COST OF REVENUE IN FISCAL 2002 WAS $5.19 BILLION COMPARED TO $3.46 BILLION IN FISCAL 2001.

THE INCREASE AS A PERCENTAGE OF REVENUE IN FISCAL 2002 WAS DUE TO AN INCREASE OF 5.3 PERCENTAGE POINTS FROM HOME AND ENTERTAINMENT PRIMARILY DUE TO COSTS RELATED TO XBOX, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A 0.7 PERCENTAGE POINT DECREASE DUE TO A HIGHER MIX OF

REVENUE FROM LICENSING BUSINESS. IN FISCAL 2001, COST OF REVENUE WAS $3.46 BILLION, AN INCREASE OF $453 MILLION COMPARED TO FISCAL 2000. THE HIGHER SALES ASSOCIATED WITH MSN SUBSCRIPTION AND MSN NETWORK SERVICES RESULTING IN INCREASED SUPPORT AND

SERVICE COSTS DROVE 0.4 OF THE 0.6 PERCENTAGE POINT INCREASE IN TOTAL COSTS AS A PERCENTAGE OF REVENUE.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

EXPENSES INCLUDE PAYROLL, EMPLOYEE BENEFITS, AND OTHER HEADCOUNT-RELATED COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT. RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES ALSO INCLUDE THIRD-PARTY DEVELOPMENT AND PROGRAMMING COSTS, LOCALIZATION COSTS INCURRED TO

TRANSLATE SOFTWARE FOR INTERNATIONAL MARKETS, AND THE AMORTIZATION OF PURCHASED SOFTWARE CODE AND SERVICES CONTENT. RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES FOR FISCAL 2003 WERE $4.66 BILLION, AN INCREASE OF 8% COMPARED TO FISCAL 2002. THE INCREASE

REFLECTS A 7% INCREASE IN HEADCOUNT-RELATED COSTS, A 25% INCREASE IN THIRD-PARTY PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT COSTS, AND A 29% INCREASE IN TESTING LABORATORY EQUIPMENT AND EXPENSE. IN FISCAL 2002, RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES WERE $4.31 BILLION COMPARED

TO $4.38 BILLION IN FISCAL 2001. THE DECREASE FROM FISCAL 2001 WAS DUE TO THE DISCONTINUATION OF AMORTIZATION OF GOODWILL IN ACCORDANCE WITH SFAS 142,

GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS,

$272 MILLION WHICH OFFSET THE 15% GROWTH IN

HEADCOUNT-RELATED COSTS. IN FISCAL 2001, RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES WERE $4.38 BILLION, AN INCREASE OF 16% COMPARED TO FISCAL 2000. THE INCREASE IN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES RESULTED FROM A 11% INCREASE IN HEADCOUNT-RELATED COSTS AND

A 23% INCREASE IN INVESTMENTS IN NEW PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT.

BILLION IN FISCAL 2002. THE INCREASE IN ABSOLUTE DOLLARS WAS DUE TO A 20% INCREASE IN SALES EXPENSES RELATED TO HEADCOUNT ADDITIONS, PRINCIPALLY RELATED TO THE ENTERPRISE AND SMALL/MEDIUM BUSINESS SALES FORCES, AND A 21% INCREASE IN MARKETING

EXPENSES.

IN FISCAL 2002, SALES AND MARKETING EXPENSES WERE $5.41 BILLION, AN INCREASE OF 11% FROM FISCAL 2001. THE SALES AND MARKETING EXPENSES IN

ABSOLUTE DOLLARS INCREASED DUE TO A 20% INCREASE IN HEADCOUNT-RELATED COSTS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A 25% DECLINE IN MSN CUSTOMER ACQUISITION MARKETING COSTS AND A 4% DECLINE IN ALL OTHER MARKETING COSTS. IN FISCAL 2001, SALES AND MARKETING EXPENSES

WERE $4.89 BILLION COMPARED TO $4.13 BILLION IN FISCAL 2000. THE 18% INCREASE IN SALES AND MARKETING FROM FISCAL 2000 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO A 21% GROWTH IN HEADCOUNT-RELATED COSTS, AND TO A LESSER EXTENT, A 3% GROWTH IN HIGHER MARKETING AND SALES

EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH MSN AND OTHER NEW SALES INITIATIVES.

GENERAL AND

ADMINISTRATIVE

GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS INCLUDE PAYROLL, EMPLOYEE

BENEFITS, AND OTHER HEADCOUNT-RELATED COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE FINANCE, LEGAL, FACILITIES, CERTAIN HUMAN RESOURCES, OTHER ADMINISTRATIVE HEADCOUNT, AND LEGAL AND OTHER ADMINISTRATIVE FEES. GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS IN FISCAL 2003 INCREASED

$554 MILLION DUE TO A CHARGE OF $750 MILLION RELATED TO A SETTLEMENT WITH AOL/TIME WARNER IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2003 AND ALSO DUE TO A $256 MILLION CHARGE REFLECTING AN INCREASE IN OUR ESTIMATE OF COSTS RELATED TO RESOLVING PENDING STATE

ANTITRUST AND UNFAIR COMPETITION CONSUMER CLASS ACTION LAWSUITS. GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES IN FISCAL 2002 INCREASED DUE TO A CHARGE OF APPROXIMATELY $660 MILLION FOR ESTIMATED EXPENSES RELATED TO RESOLVING PENDING STATE ANTITRUST AND

FOR USING THE EQUITY METHOD, AND INCOME OR LOSS ATTRIBUTABLE TO MINORITY INTERESTS. THE DECREASE IN LOSSES ON EQUITY INVESTEES AND OTHER IN FISCAL 2003 AND 2002 WAS DUE TO THE DIVESTITURE OF CERTAIN EQUITY INVESTMENTS IN FISCAL 2002 IN CONJUNCTION

WITH THE UNDERLYING PERFORMANCE OF SUCH ENTITIES. THE INCREASE IN LOSSES ON EQUITY INVESTEES AND OTHER IN FISCAL 2001 REFLECTED AN INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF SUCH INVESTMENTS DURING THE YEAR.

INVESTMENTS ARE CONSIDERED TO BE IMPAIRED WHEN

A DECLINE IN FAIR VALUE IS JUDGED TO BE OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY. WE EMPLOY A SYSTEMATIC METHODOLOGY THAT CONSIDERS AVAILABLE EVIDENCE IN EVALUATING POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT OF OUR INVESTMENTS. IF THE COST OF AN INVESTMENT EXCEEDS ITS FAIR VALUE, WE

EVALUATE, AMONG OTHER FACTORS, GENERAL MARKET CONDITIONS, THE DURATION AND EXTENT TO WHICH THE FAIR VALUE IS LESS THAN COST, AS WELL AS OUR INTENT AND ABILITY TO HOLD THE INVESTMENT. WE ALSO CONSIDER SPECIFIC ADVERSE CONDITIONS RELATED TO THE

FINANCIAL HEALTH OF AND BUSINESS OUTLOOK FOR THE INVESTEE, INCLUDING INDUSTRY AND SECTOR PERFORMANCE, CHANGES IN TECHNOLOGY, OPERATIONAL AND FINANCING CASH FLOW FACTORS, AND RATING AGENCY ACTIONS. ONCE A DECLINE IN FAIR VALUE IS DETERMINED TO BE

OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY, AN IMPAIRMENT CHARGE IS RECORDED AND A NEW COST BASIS IN THE INVESTMENT IS ESTABLISHED.

IN FISCAL 2003, OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY

IMPAIRMENTS DECREASED MAINLY DUE TO THE LACK OF SIGNIFICANT CONTINUED IMPAIRMENTS IN THE CABLE AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS SECTORS. INTEREST INCOME DECREASED $65 MILLION DUE TO DECLINING INTEREST RATES PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A LARGER INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO.

DIVIDEND INCOME DECREASED $97 MILLION PRIMARILY RELATED TO THE EXCHANGE OF AT&T 5% CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED DEBT FOR COMMON SHARES OF AT&T CORPORATION DURING THE YEAR.

IN FISCAL 2002, OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENTS PRIMARILY RELATED TO OUR INVESTMENT IN AT&T AND OTHER CABLE AND TELECOMMUNICATION INVESTMENTS. NET GAINS ON THE

SALES OF INVESTMENTS INCLUDED A $1.25 BILLION GAIN ON SALE OF OUR SHARE OF EXPEDIA. INTEREST AND DIVIDEND INCOME DECREASED $66 MILLION FROM FISCAL 2001 AS A RESULT OF LOWER INTEREST RATES AND DIVIDEND INCOME.

IN FISCAL 2001, OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENTS PRIMARILY RELATED TO CABLE AND TELECOMMUNICATION INVESTMENTS. NET GAINS FROM THE SALES OF INVESTMENTS IN FISCAL

2001 INCLUDED A GAIN FROM OUR INVESTMENT IN TITUS COMMUNICATIONS (WHICH WAS MERGED WITH JUPITER TELECOMMUNICATIONS) AND THE CLOSING OF THE SALE OF TRANSPOINT TO CHECKFREE HOLDINGS CORP. INTEREST AND DIVIDEND INCOME INCREASED $591 MILLION FROM FISCAL

2000, REFLECTING A LARGER INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO.

INCOME TAXES

OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR FISCAL 2003 WAS 32%, REFLECTING A ONE-TIME BENEFIT IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF $126 MILLION FROM THE REVERSAL OF PREVIOUSLY

ACCRUED TAXES. THE TAX REVERSAL STEMS FROM A 9TH CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS RULING IN DECEMBER 2002 OVERTURNING A PREVIOUS TAX COURT RULING THAT HAD DENIED TAX BENEFITS ON CERTAIN REVENUE EARNED FROM THE DISTRIBUTION OF SOFTWARE TO FOREIGN CUSTOMERS.

EXCLUDING THIS REVERSAL, THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE WOULD HAVE BEEN 33%. THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR FISCAL 2001 AND FISCAL 2002 WAS 33% AND 32%, RESPECTIVELY.

ACCOUNTING CHANGES

EFFECTIVE JULY 1, 2001, WE ADOPTED SFAS 141,

BUSINESS COMBINATIONS,

AND SFAS 142,

GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS

. SFAS 141 REQUIRES BUSINESS COMBINATIONS TO BE ACCOUNTED FOR USING THE PURCHASE METHOD OF ACCOUNTING. IT

ALSO SPECIFIES THE TYPES OF ACQUIRED INTANGIBLE ASSETS THAT ARE REQUIRED TO BE RECOGNIZED AND REPORTED SEPARATE FROM GOODWILL. SFAS 142 REQUIRES THAT GOODWILL AND CERTAIN INTANGIBLES NO LONGER BE AMORTIZED, BUT INSTEAD TESTED FOR IMPAIRMENT AT LEAST

ANNUALLY. THERE WAS NO IMPAIRMENT OF GOODWILL UPON ADOPTION OF SFAS 142. GOODWILL AMORTIZATION (ON A PRE-TAX BASIS) WAS $311 MILLION IN FISCAL 2001.

EFFECTIVE JULY 1, 2000, WE ADOPTED SFAS 133,

ACCOUNTING FOR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES,

WHICH ESTABLISHES ACCOUNTING AND REPORTING STANDARDS FOR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS, INCLUDING CERTAIN DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS

EMBEDDED IN OTHER CONTRACTS AND FOR HEDGING ACTIVITIES. THE ADOPTION OF SFAS 133 RESULTED IN A CUMULATIVE PRE-TAX REDUCTION TO INCOME OF $560 MILLION ($375 MILLION AFTER-TAX) AND A CUMULATIVE PRE-TAX REDUCTION TO OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (OCI) OF

$112 MILLION ($75 MILLION AFTER-TAX). THE REDUCTION TO INCOME WAS MOSTLY ATTRIBUTABLE TO A LOSS OF APPROXIMATELY $300 MILLION RECLASSIFIED FROM OCI FOR THE TIME VALUE OF OPTIONS AND A LOSS OF APPROXIMATELY $250 MILLION RECLASSIFIED FROM OCI FOR

DERIVATIVES NOT DESIGNATED AS HEDGING INSTRUMENTS. THE REDUCTION TO OCI WAS MOSTLY ATTRIBUTABLE TO LOSSES OF APPROXIMATELY $670 MILLION ON CASH FLOW HEDGES OFFSET BY THE RECLASSIFICATIONS OUT OF OCI OF THE APPROXIMATELY $300 MILLION LOSS FOR THE

TIME VALUE OF OPTIONS AND THE APPROXIMATELY $250 MILLION LOSS FOR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS NOT DESIGNATED AS HEDGING INSTRUMENTS.

STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION

ON JULY 8, 2003, WE ANNOUNCED CHANGES IN EMPLOYEE COMPENSATION DESIGNED TO HELP US CONTINUE TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN THE BEST EMPLOYEES, AND TO BETTER ALIGN EMPLOYEE INTERESTS WITH THOSE OF OUR SHAREHOLDERS. EMPLOYEES WILL BE

GRANTED STOCK AWARDS INSTEAD OF STOCK OPTIONS. THE STOCK AWARD PROGRAM OFFERS EMPLOYEES THE OPPORTUNITY TO EARN ACTUAL SHARES OF OUR STOCK OVER TIME, RATHER THAN OPTIONS THAT GIVE EMPLOYEES THE RIGHT TO PURCHASE STOCK AT A SET PRICE. AS PART OF THE

CHANGES, WE ANNOUNCED THAT A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION FOR MORE THAN 600 OF OUR SENIOR LEADERS WILL DEPEND ON GROWTH IN THE NUMBER AND SATISFACTION OF OUR CUSTOMERS. WE ALSO INDICATED THAT WE ARE WORKING ON A PLAN TO ENABLE

EMPLOYEES TO REALIZE SOME VALUE ON THE PORTION OF THEIR STOCK OPTIONS THAT ARE CURRENTLY OUT-OF-THE-MONEY, BY SELLING THEIR OPTIONS TO A THIRD-PARTY FINANCIAL INSTITUTION. IF APPROVED, WE EXPECT TO IMPLEMENT THIS PLAN BY THE END OF 2003.

IN ADDITION TO ANNOUNCING CHANGES TO OUR EMPLOYEE COMPENSATION ARRANGEMENTS, WE ALSO INDICATED THAT WE WILL ADOPT THE FAIR VALUE RECOGNITION PROVISIONS OF SFAS

123,

ACCOUNTING FOR STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION,

EFFECTIVE JULY 1, 2003, AND WILL REPORT THAT CHANGE IN ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLE USING THE RETROACTIVE RESTATEMENT METHOD DESCRIBED IN SFAS 148,

ACCOUNTING FOR STOCK-BASED

COMPENSATIONTRANSITION AND DISCLOSURE

. NOTE 16 OF THE NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS PROVIDES PRO FORMA INCOME STATEMENTS FOR 2001, 2002, AND 2003 AS IF COMPENSATION COST FOR OUR STOCK OPTION AND EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLANS HAD BEEN

DETERMINED AS PRESCRIBED BY SFAS 123.

FINANCIAL CONDITION

OUR CASH AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO TOTALED $49.05 BILLION AT JUNE 30, 2003, AN INCREASE OF

$10.40 BILLION FROM FISCAL YEAR 2002. THE PORTFOLIO CONSISTS PRIMARILY OF FIXED-INCOME SECURITIES, DIVERSIFIED AMONG INDUSTRIES AND INDIVIDUAL ISSUERS. OUR INVESTMENTS ARE GENERALLY LIQUID AND INVESTMENT GRADE. THE PORTFOLIO IS INVESTED

PREDOMINANTLY IN U.S. DOLLAR DENOMINATED SECURITIES, BUT ALSO INCLUDES FOREIGN CURRENCY POSITIONS, IN ORDER TO DIVERSIFY FINANCIAL RISK. THE PORTFOLIO IS PRIMARILY INVESTED IN SHORT-TERM SECURITIES TO MINIMIZE INTEREST RATE RISK AND FACILITATE RAPID

DEPLOYMENT FOR IMMEDIATE CASH NEEDS.

UNEARNED REVENUE AS OF JUNE 30, 2003 WAS $9.02 BILLION, INCREASING $1.27 BILLION FROM JUNE 30, 2002, REFLECTING

THE ADDITION OF NEW AND ANNIVERSARY MULTI-YEAR LICENSING AGREEMENTS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY CONTINUED RECOGNITION OF UNEARNED REVENUE FROM MULTI-YEAR LICENSING IN PRIOR PERIODS.

CASH FLOW FROM OPERATIONS WAS $15.80 BILLION FOR FISCAL 2003, AN INCREASE OF $1.29 BILLION FROM FISCAL 2002. THE INCREASE REFLECTS A $2.16 BILLION INCREASE IN NET

INCOME FROM FISCAL YEAR 2002 AND AN INCREASE OF $1.37 BILLION IN UNEARNED REVENUE, OFFSET BY AN INCREASE OF $2.36 BILLION IN RECOGNITION OF UNEARNED REVENUE. CASH USED FOR FINANCING WAS $5.22 BILLION IN FISCAL 2003, AN INCREASE OF $651 MILLION FROM

THE PRIOR YEAR. THE INCREASE REFLECTS A CASH DIVIDEND PAYMENT OF $857 MILLION IN 2003 AND AN INCREASE OF $417 MILLION IN COMMON STOCK REPURCHASE, OFFSETTING $623 MILLION RECEIVED FOR COMMON STOCK ISSUED. WE REPURCHASED 238.2 MILLION SHARES OF

COMMON STOCK UNDER OUR SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM IN FISCAL 2003. CASH USED FOR INVESTING WAS $7.21 BILLION IN FISCAL 2003, A DECREASE OF $3.63 BILLION FROM FISCAL 2002, DUE TO STRONGER PORTFOLIO PERFORMANCE ON SOLD AND MATURED INVESTMENTS.

CASH FLOW FROM OPERATIONS WAS $14.51 BILLION FOR FISCAL 2002, AN INCREASE OF $1.09 BILLION FROM FISCAL 2001. THE INCREASE REFLECTED STRONG GROWTH IN

UNEARNED REVENUE AS A RESULT OF THE SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF CUSTOMERS THAT PURCHASED UPGRADE ADVANTAGE DURING THE LICENSING 6.0 TRANSITION PERIOD. THIS RESULTED IN AN INCREASE IN BILLINGS AND A CORRESPONDING INCREASE IN THE UNEARNED REVENUE AMOUNT.

CASH USED FOR FINANCING WAS $4.57 BILLION IN FISCAL 2002, A DECREASE OF $1.01 BILLION FROM THE PRIOR YEAR. THE DECREASE REFLECTED THE REPURCHASE OF PUT WARRANTS IN THE PRIOR YEAR. WE REPURCHASED 245.6 MILLION SHARES OF COMMON STOCK UNDER OUR SHARE

REPURCHASE PROGRAM IN FISCAL 2002. IN ADDITION, 10.2 MILLION SHARES OF COMMON STOCK WERE ACQUIRED IN FISCAL 2002 UNDER A STRUCTURED STOCK REPURCHASE TRANSACTION. WE ENTERED INTO THE STRUCTURED STOCK REPURCHASE TRANSACTION IN FISCAL 2001, WHICH GAVE

US THE RIGHT TO ACQUIRE 10.2 MILLION OF OUR SHARES IN EXCHANGE FOR AN UP-FRONT NET PAYMENT OF $264 MILLION. CASH USED FOR INVESTING WAS $10.85 BILLION IN FISCAL 2002, AN INCREASE OF $2.11 BILLION FROM FISCAL 2001.

CASH FLOW FROM OPERATIONS WAS $13.42 BILLION IN FISCAL 2001, AN INCREASE OF $2.00

BILLION FROM THE PRIOR YEAR. THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE GROWTH IN REVENUE AND OTHER CHANGES IN WORKING CAPITAL, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECREASE IN THE STOCK OPTION INCOME TAX BENEFIT, REFLECTING DECREASED STOCK OPTION EXERCISES BY

EMPLOYEES. CASH USED FOR FINANCING WAS $5.59 BILLION IN FISCAL 2001, AN INCREASE OF $3.39 BILLION FROM THE PRIOR YEAR. THE INCREASE PRIMARILY REFLECTED THE REPURCHASE OF PUT WARRANTS IN FISCAL 2001, COMPARED TO THE SALE OF PUT WARRANTS IN THE PRIOR

FISCAL YEAR, AS WELL AS AN INCREASE IN COMMON STOCK REPURCHASED. ALL OUTSTANDING PUT WARRANTS WERE EITHER RETIRED OR EXERCISED DURING FISCAL 2001. DURING FISCAL 2001, WE REPURCHASED 178.1 MILLION SHARES. CASH USED FOR INVESTING WAS $8.73 BILLION IN

FISCAL 2001, A DECREASE OF $658 MILLION FROM THE PRIOR YEAR.

WE HAVE NO MATERIAL LONG-TERM DEBT. STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY AT JUNE 30, 2003 WAS

$61.02 BILLION. WE WILL CONTINUE TO INVEST IN SALES, MARKETING, PRODUCT SUPPORT INFRASTRUCTURE, AND EXISTING AND ADVANCED AREAS OF TECHNOLOGY. ADDITIONS TO PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT WILL CONTINUE, INCLUDING NEW FACILITIES AND COMPUTER SYSTEMS FOR

R&D, SALES AND MARKETING, SUPPORT, AND ADMINISTRATIVE STAFF. COMMITMENTS FOR CONSTRUCTING NEW BUILDINGS WERE $117 MILLION ON JUNE 30, 2003. WE HAVE NOT ENGAGED IN ANY RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS OR ARRANGEMENTS WITH UNCONSOLIDATED ENTITIES OR

OTHER PERSONS THAT ARE REASONABLY LIKELY TO MATERIALLY AFFECT LIQUIDITY OR THE AVAILABILITY OF OR REQUIREMENTS FOR CAPITAL RESOURCES.

WE BELIEVE

EXISTING CASH AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS TOGETHER WITH FUNDS GENERATED FROM OPERATIONS SHOULD BE SUFFICIENT TO MEET OPERATING REQUIREMENTS. OUR PHILOSOPHY REGARDING THE MAINTENANCE OF A BALANCE SHEET WITH A LARGE COMPONENT OF CASH AND SHORT-TERM

INVESTMENTS, AS WELL AS EQUITY AND OTHER INVESTMENTS, REFLECTS OUR VIEWS ON POTENTIAL FUTURE CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS RELATING TO RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, CREATION AND EXPANSION OF SALES DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS, INVESTMENTS AND ACQUISITIONS, SHARE

DILUTION MANAGEMENT, LEGAL RISKS, AND CHALLENGES TO OUR BUSINESS MODEL. WE CONTINUOUSLY ASSESS OUR INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT APPROACH IN VIEW OF OUR CURRENT AND POTENTIAL FUTURE NEEDS.

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS

WE HAVE OPERATING LEASES FOR MOST U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL SALES AND SUPPORT OFFICES AND CERTAIN EQUIPMENT. RENTAL EXPENSE FOR OPERATING LEASES WAS $281 MILLION, $318 MILLION, AND

$290 MILLION IN 2001, 2002, AND 2003, RESPECTIVELY. FUTURE MINIMUM RENTAL COMMITMENTS UNDER NONCANCELLABLE LEASES, IN MILLIONS OF DOLLARS, ARE: 2004, $218; 2005, $202; 2006, $172; 2007, $134; 2008, $116; AND THEREAFTER, $429.

WE HAVE UNCONDITIONALLY GUARANTEED THE REPAYMENT OF CERTAIN JAPANESE YEN DENOMINATED BANK LOANS AND RELATED INTEREST AND FEES OF JUPITER TELECOMMUNICATION, LTD., A

JAPANESE CABLE COMPANY (JUPITER). THESE GUARANTEES AROSE ON FEBRUARY 1, 2003 IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE EXPIRATION OF PRIOR FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS, INCLUDING PREVIOUS GUARANTEES BY US. THE FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS WERE ENTERED INTO BY JUPITER AS PART OF

FINANCING ITS OPERATIONS. AS PART OF JUPITERS NEW FINANCING AGREEMENT, WE AGREED TO GUARANTEE REPAYMENT BY JUPITER OF THE LOANS OF APPROXIMATELY $51 MILLION. THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE AND THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE GUARANTEES WAS $10.5 MILLION

AND DID NOT RESULT IN A CHARGE TO OPERATIONS. THE GUARANTEES ARE IN EFFECT UNTIL THE EARLIER OF REPAYMENT OF THE LOANS, INCLUDING ACCRUED INTEREST AND FEES, OR FEBRUARY 1, 2009. THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT OF THE GUARANTEES IS LIMITED TO THE SUM OF THE TOTAL

DUE AND UNPAID PRINCIPAL AMOUNTS, ACCRUED AND UNPAID INTEREST, AND ANY OTHER RELATED EXPENSES. ADDITIONALLY, THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT OF THE GUARANTEES, DENOMINATED IN JAPANESE YEN, WILL VARY BASED ON FLUCTUATIONS IN FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES. IF WE WERE

REQUIRED TO MAKE PAYMENTS UNDER THE GUARANTEES, WE MAY RECOVER ALL OR A PORTION OF THOSE PAYMENTS UPON LIQUIDATION OF JUPITERS ASSETS. THE PROCEEDS FROM SUCH LIQUIDATION CANNOT BE ACCURATELY ESTIMATED DUE TO THE MULTITUDE OF FACTORS THAT WOULD

AFFECT THE VALUATION AND REALIZATION OF THE PROCEEDS IN THE EVENT OF LIQUIDATION.

IN CONNECTION WITH VARIOUS OPERATING LEASES, WE ISSUED RESIDUAL

VALUE GUARANTEES, WHICH PROVIDE THAT IF WE DO NOT PURCHASE THE LEASED PROPERTY FROM THE LESSOR AT THE END OF THE LEASE TERM, THEN WE ARE LIABLE TO THE LESSOR FOR AN AMOUNT EQUAL TO THE SHORTAGE (IF ANY) BETWEEN THE PROCEEDS FROM THE SALE OF THE

PROPERTY AND AN AGREED VALUE. AS OF JUNE 30, 2003, THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT OF THE RESIDUAL VALUE GUARANTEES WAS APPROXIMATELY $271 MILLION. WE BELIEVE THAT PROCEEDS FROM THE SALE OF PROPERTIES UNDER OPERATING LEASES WOULD EXCEED THE PAYMENT OBLIGATION

AND THEREFORE NO LIABILITY TO US CURRENTLY EXISTS.

WE PROVIDE INDEMNIFICATIONS OF VARYING SCOPE AND SIZE TO CERTAIN CUSTOMERS AGAINST CLAIMS OF

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY INFRINGEMENT MADE BY THIRD PARTIES ARISING FROM THE USE OF OUR PRODUCTS. WE EVALUATE ESTIMATED LOSSES FOR SUCH INDEMNIFICATIONS UNDER SFAS 5,

ACCOUNTING FOR CONTINGENCIES

, AS INTERPRETED BY FIN 45. WE CONSIDER SUCH

FACTORS AS THE DEGREE OF PROBABILITY OF AN UNFAVORABLE OUTCOME AND THE ABILITY TO MAKE A REASONABLE ESTIMATE OF THE AMOUNT OF LOSS. TO DATE, WE HAVE NOT ENCOUNTERED MATERIAL COSTS AS A RESULT OF SUCH OBLIGATIONS AND HAVE NOT ACCRUED ANY LIABILITIES

RELATED TO SUCH INDEMNIFICATIONS IN OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

RECENTLY ISSUED

ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

IN JANUARY 2003, THE FASB ISSUED INTERPRETATION 46,

CONSOLIDATION OF VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES.

IN GENERAL, A VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITY IS A CORPORATION, PARTNERSHIP, TRUST, OR ANY OTHER LEGAL STRUCTURE USED FOR BUSINESS PURPOSES THAT EITHER (A) DOES NOT HAVE EQUITY INVESTORS WITH VOTING

RIGHTS OR (B) HAS EQUITY INVESTORS THAT DO NOT PROVIDE SUFFICIENT FINANCIAL RESOURCES FOR THE ENTITY TO SUPPORT ITS ACTIVITIES. INTERPRETATION 46 REQUIRES A VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITY TO BE CONSOLIDATED BY A COMPANY IF THAT COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO A

MAJORITY OF THE RISK OF LOSS FROM THE VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITYS ACTIVITIES OR ENTITLED TO RECEIVE A MAJORITY OF THE ENTITYS RESIDUAL RETURNS OR BOTH. THE CONSOLIDATION REQUIREMENTS OF INTERPRETATION 46 APPLY IMMEDIATELY TO VARIABLE

INTEREST ENTITIES CREATED AFTER JANUARY 31, 2003. THE CONSOLIDATION REQUIREMENTS APPLY TO TRANSACTIONS ENTERED INTO PRIOR TO FEBRUARY 1, 2003 IN THE FIRST FISCAL YEAR OR INTERIM PERIOD BEGINNING AFTER JUNE 15, 2003. CERTAIN OF THE DISCLOSURE

REQUIREMENTS APPLY IN ALL FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ISSUED AFTER JANUARY 31, 2003, REGARDLESS OF WHEN THE VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITY WAS ESTABLISHED. THE ADOPTION OF THE INTERPRETATION ON JULY 1, 2003 DID NOT HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS.

IN APRIL 2003, THE FASB ISSUED SFAS 149,

AMENDMENT OF STATEMENT 133 ON DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES

, WHICH AMENDS

AND CLARIFIES ACCOUNTING FOR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS, INCLUDING CERTAIN DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS EMBEDDED IN OTHER CONTRACTS, AND FOR HEDGING ACTIVITIES UNDER SFAS 133. THE STATEMENT IS EFFECTIVE (WITH CERTAIN EXCEPTIONS) FOR CONTRACTS ENTERED INTO OR

MODIFIED AFTER JUNE 30, 2003. WE DO NOT BELIEVE THE ADOPTION OF THIS STATEMENT WILL HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

IN MAY 2003,

THE FASB ISSUED SFAS 150,

ACCOUNTING FOR CERTAIN FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WITH CHARACTERISTICS OF BOTH LIABILITIES AND EQUITY.

THE STATEMENT ESTABLISHES STANDARDS FOR HOW AN ISSUER CLASSIFIES AND MEASURES CERTAIN FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WITH

15  /  MSFT

2003 FORM 10-K

TABLE OF CONTENTS

PART II, ITEM 7

CHARACTERISTICS OF BOTH LIABILITIES AND EQUITY. IT REQUIRES THAT AN ISSUER CLASSIFY A FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT THAT IS WITHIN ITS SCOPE AS A LIABILITY (OR AN ASSET IN SOME

CIRCUMSTANCES). IT IS EFFECTIVE FOR FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS ENTERED INTO OR MODIFIED AFTER MAY 31, 2003, AND OTHERWISE IS EFFECTIVE AT THE BEGINNING OF THE FIRST INTERIM PERIOD BEGINNING AFTER JUNE 15, 2003. WHILE WE DO NOT BELIEVE THE ADOPTION OF

THIS STATEMENT WILL HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, WE CONTINUE TO ASSESS THE IMPACT THIS STATEMENT WILL HAVE ON CERTAIN OF OUR SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAMS.

APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND ACCOMPANYING NOTES ARE PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH U.S. GAAP. PREPARING FINANCIAL STATEMENTS REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT

AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS, LIABILITIES, REVENUE, AND EXPENSES. THESE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS ARE AFFECTED BY MANAGEMENTS APPLICATION OF ACCOUNTING POLICIES. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES FOR US INCLUDE REVENUE RECOGNITION,

IMPAIRMENT OF INVESTMENT SECURITIES, IMPAIRMENT OF GOODWILL, ACCOUNTING FOR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS, ACCOUNTING FOR LEGAL CONTINGENCIES, AND ACCOUNTING FOR INCOME TAXES.

WE ACCOUNT FOR THE LICENSING OF SOFTWARE IN ACCORDANCE WITH AMERICAN INSTITUTE OF CERTIFIED PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS (AICPA) STATEMENT OF POSITION (SOP) 97-2,

SOFTWARE

REVENUE RECOGNITION.

THE APPLICATION OF SOP 97-2 REQUIRES JUDGMENT, INCLUDING WHETHER A SOFTWARE ARRANGEMENT INCLUDES MULTIPLE ELEMENTS, AND IF SO, WHETHER VENDOR-SPECIFIC OBJECTIVE EVIDENCE (VSOE) OF FAIR VALUE EXISTS FOR THOSE ELEMENTS. END

USERS RECEIVE CERTAIN ELEMENTS OF OUR PRODUCTS OVER A PERIOD OF TIME. THESE ELEMENTS INCLUDE FREE POST-DELIVERY TELEPHONE SUPPORT AND THE RIGHT TO RECEIVE UNSPECIFIED UPGRADES/ENHANCEMENTS OF MICROSOFT INTERNET EXPLORER ON A WHEN-AND-IF-AVAILABLE

BASIS, THE FAIR VALUE OF WHICH IS RECOGNIZED OVER THE PRODUCTS ESTIMATED LIFE CYCLE. CHANGES TO THE ELEMENTS IN A SOFTWARE ARRANGEMENT, THE ABILITY TO IDENTIFY VSOE FOR THOSE ELEMENTS, THE FAIR VALUE OF THE RESPECTIVE ELEMENTS, AND CHANGES TO

A PRODUCTS ESTIMATED LIFE CYCLE COULD MATERIALLY IMPACT THE AMOUNT OF EARNED AND UNEARNED REVENUE. JUDGMENT IS ALSO REQUIRED TO ASSESS WHETHER FUTURE RELEASES OF CERTAIN SOFTWARE REPRESENT NEW PRODUCTS OR UPGRADES AND ENHANCEMENTS TO EXISTING

PRODUCTS.

SFAS 115,

ACCOUNTING FOR CERTAIN INVESTMENTS IN DEBT AND EQUITY SECURITIES

, AND SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (SEC) STAFF

ACCOUNTING BULLETIN (SAB) 59,

ACCOUNTING FOR NONCURRENT MARKETABLE EQUITY SECURITIES

, PROVIDE GUIDANCE ON DETERMINING WHEN AN INVESTMENT IS OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARILY IMPAIRED. THIS DETERMINATION REQUIRES SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT. IN MAKING THIS

JUDGMENT, WE EVALUATE, AMONG OTHER FACTORS, THE DURATION AND EXTENT TO WHICH THE FAIR VALUE OF AN INVESTMENT IS LESS THAN ITS COST; THE FINANCIAL HEALTH OF AND NEAR-TERM BUSINESS OUTLOOK FOR THE INVESTEE, INCLUDING FACTORS SUCH AS INDUSTRY AND

SECTOR PERFORMANCE, CHANGES IN TECHNOLOGY, AND OPERATIONAL AND FINANCING CASH FLOW; AND OUR INTENT AND ABILITY TO HOLD THE INVESTMENT.

SFAS 142,

GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS

, REQUIRES THAT GOODWILL BE TESTED FOR IMPAIRMENT AT THE REPORTING UNIT LEVEL (OPERATING SEGMENT OR ONE LEVEL BELOW AN OPERATING SEGMENT) ON AN ANNUAL BASIS (JULY 1

ST

FOR MICROSOFT) AND BETWEEN

ANNUAL TESTS IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES. APPLICATION OF THE GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT TEST REQUIRES JUDGMENT, INCLUDING THE IDENTIFICATION OF REPORTING UNITS, ASSIGNING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES TO REPORTING UNITS, ASSIGNING GOODWILL TO REPORTING UNITS, AND

DETERMINING THE FAIR VALUE OF EACH REPORTING UNIT. SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENTS REQUIRED TO ESTIMATE THE FAIR VALUE OF REPORTING UNITS INCLUDE ESTIMATING FUTURE CASH FLOWS, DETERMINING APPROPRIATE DISCOUNT RATES AND OTHER ASSUMPTIONS. CHANGES IN THESE

ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS COULD MATERIALLY AFFECT THE DETERMINATION OF FAIR VALUE AND/OR GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT FOR EACH REPORTING UNIT.

WE ACCOUNT FOR

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH SEVERAL ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS, INCLUDING SFAS 2,

ACCOUNTING FOR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS

, AND SFAS 86,

ACCOUNTING FOR THE COSTS OF COMPUTER SOFTWARE TO BE SOLD, LEASED, OR

OTHERWISE MARKETED.

SFAS 86 SPECIFIES THAT COSTS INCURRED INTERNALLY IN CREATING A COMPUTER SOFTWARE PRODUCT SHOULD BE CHARGED TO EXPENSE WHEN INCURRED AS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT UNTIL TECHNOLOGICAL FEASIBILITY HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED FOR THE

PRODUCT. ONCE TECHNOLOGICAL FEASIBILITY IS ESTABLISHED, ALL SOFTWARE COSTS SHOULD BE CAPITALIZED UNTIL THE PRODUCT IS AVAILABLE FOR GENERAL RELEASE TO CUSTOMERS. JUDGMENT IS REQUIRED IN DETERMINING WHEN TECHNOLOGICAL FEASIBILITY OF A PRODUCT IS

ESTABLISHED. WE HAVE DETERMINED THAT TECHNOLOGICAL FEASIBILITY FOR OUR PRODUCTS IS REACHED SHORTLY BEFORE THE PRODUCTS ARE RELEASED TO MANUFACTURING. COSTS INCURRED AFTER TECHNOLOGICAL FEASIBILITY IS ESTABLISHED ARE NOT MATERIAL, AND ACCORDINGLY, WE

EXPENSE ALL RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS WHEN INCURRED.

WE ARE SUBJECT TO VARIOUS LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND CLAIMS, THE OUTCOMES OF WHICH ARE SUBJECT

TO SIGNIFICANT UNCERTAINTY. SFAS 5,

ACCOUNTING FOR CONTINGENCIES

, REQUIRES THAT AN ESTIMATED LOSS FROM A LOSS CONTINGENCY SHOULD BE ACCRUED BY A CHARGE TO INCOME IF IT IS PROBABLE THAT AN ASSET HAS BEEN IMPAIRED OR A LIABILITY HAS BEEN

INCURRED AND THE AMOUNT OF THE LOSS CAN BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED. DISCLOSURE OF A CONTINGENCY IS REQUIRED IF THERE IS AT LEAST A REASONABLE POSSIBILITY THAT A LOSS HAS BEEN INCURRED. WE EVALUATE, AMONG OTHER FACTORS, THE DEGREE OF PROBABILITY OF AN

UNFAVORABLE OUTCOME AND THE ABILITY TO MAKE A REASONABLE ESTIMATE OF THE AMOUNT OF LOSS. CHANGES IN THESE FACTORS COULD MATERIALLY IMPACT OUR FINANCIAL POSITION OR OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

SFAS 109,

ACCOUNTING FOR INCOME TAXES

, ESTABLISHES FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING AND REPORTING STANDARDS FOR THE EFFECT OF INCOME TAXES. THE OBJECTIVES OF ACCOUNTING

FOR INCOME TAXES ARE TO RECOGNIZE THE AMOUNT OF TAXES PAYABLE OR REFUNDABLE FOR THE CURRENT YEAR AND DEFERRED TAX LIABILITIES AND ASSETS FOR THE FUTURE TAX CONSEQUENCES OF EVENTS THAT HAVE BEEN RECOGNIZED IN AN ENTITYS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OR

TAX RETURNS. JUDGMENT IS REQUIRED IN ASSESSING THE FUTURE TAX CONSEQUENCES OF EVENTS THAT HAVE BEEN RECOGNIZED IN OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OR TAX RETURNS. FLUCTUATIONS IN THE ACTUAL OUTCOME OF THESE FUTURE TAX CONSEQUENCES COULD MATERIALLY IMPACT

OUR FINANCIAL POSITION OR OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

ISSUES AND UNCERTAINTIES

THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K CONTAINS STATEMENTS THAT ARE FORWARD-LOOKING. THESE

STATEMENTS ARE BASED ON CURRENT EXPECTATIONS AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT ARE SUBJECT TO RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES. ACTUAL RESULTS COULD DIFFER MATERIALLY BECAUSE OF ISSUES AND UNCERTAINTIES SUCH AS THOSE LISTED BELOW AND ELSEWHERE IN THIS REPORT, WHICH,

AMONG OTHERS, SHOULD BE CONSIDERED IN EVALUATING OUR FINANCIAL OUTLOOK.

CHALLENGES TO OUR BUSINESS MODEL

SINCE OUR INCEPTION, OUR

BUSINESS MODEL HAS BEEN BASED UPON CUSTOMERS AGREEING TO PAY A FEE TO LICENSE SOFTWARE DEVELOPED AND DISTRIBUTED BY US. UNDER THIS COMMERCIAL SOFTWARE MODEL, SOFTWARE DEVELOPERS BEAR THE COSTS OF CONVERTING ORIGINAL IDEAS INTO SOFTWARE PRODUCTS

THROUGH INVESTMENTS IN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, OFFSETTING THESE COSTS WITH THE REVENUES RECEIVED FROM THE DISTRIBUTION OF THEIR PRODUCTS. WE BELIEVE THE COMMERCIAL SOFTWARE MODEL HAS HAD SUBSTANTIAL BENEFITS FOR USERS OF SOFTWARE, ALLOWING THEM TO

RELY ON OUR EXPERTISE AND THE EXPERTISE OF OTHER SOFTWARE DEVELOPERS THAT HAVE POWERFUL INCENTIVES TO DEVELOP

16  /  MSFT

2003 FORM 10-K

TABLE OF CONTENTS

PART II, ITEM 7

INNOVATIVE SOFTWARE THAT IS USEFUL, RELIABLE, AND COMPATIBLE WITH OTHER SOFTWARE AND HARDWARE. IN RECENT YEARS, THERE HAS BEEN A GROWING CHALLENGE TO THE COMMERCIAL

SOFTWARE MODEL, OFTEN REFERRED TO AS THE OPEN SOURCE MODEL. UNDER THE OPEN SOURCE MODEL, SOFTWARE IS PRODUCED BY LOOSELY ASSOCIATED GROUPS OF UNPAID PROGRAMMERS, AND THE RESULTING SOFTWARE AND THE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY CONTAINED THEREIN IS LICENSED

TO END USERS AT SUBSTANTIALLY NO COST. THE MOST NOTABLE EXAMPLE OF OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE IS THE LINUX OPERATING SYSTEM. WHILE WE BELIEVE THAT OUR PRODUCTS PROVIDE CUSTOMERS WITH SIGNIFICANT ADVANTAGES IN SECURITY AND PRODUCTIVITY, AND GENERALLY HAVE

A LOWER TOTAL COST OF OWNERSHIP THAN OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE, THE POPULARIZATION OF THE OPEN SOURCE MODEL CONTINUES TO POSE A SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGE TO OUR BUSINESS MODEL, INCLUDING RECENT EFFORTS BY PROPONENTS OF THE OPEN SOURCE MODEL TO CONVINCE

GOVERNMENTS WORLDWIDE TO MANDATE THE USE OF OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE IN THEIR PURCHASE AND DEPLOYMENT OF SOFTWARE PRODUCTS. TO THE EXTENT THE OPEN SOURCE MODEL GAINS INCREASING MARKET ACCEPTANCE, SALES OF OUR PRODUCTS MAY DECLINE, WE MAY HAVE TO REDUCE

THE PRICES WE CHARGE FOR OUR PRODUCTS, AND REVENUES AND OPERATING MARGINS MAY CONSEQUENTLY DECLINE.

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS

WE DEFEND OUR

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS, BUT UNLICENSED COPYING AND USE OF SOFTWARE AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS REPRESENTS A LOSS OF REVENUE TO US. WHILE THIS ADVERSELY AFFECTS U.S. REVENUE, THE IMPACT ON REVENUE FROM OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES IS MORE

SIGNIFICANT, PARTICULARLY IN COUNTRIES WHERE LAWS ARE LESS PROTECTIVE OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS. THROUGHOUT THE WORLD, WE ACTIVELY EDUCATE CONSUMERS ABOUT THE BENEFITS OF LICENSING GENUINE PRODUCTS AND EDUCATE LAWMAKERS ABOUT THE ADVANTAGES OF

A BUSINESS CLIMATE WHERE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS ARE PROTECTED. HOWEVER, CONTINUED EDUCATIONAL AND ENFORCEMENT EFFORTS MAY NOT AFFECT REVENUE POSITIVELY AND FURTHER DETERIORATION IN COMPLIANCE WITH EXISTING LEGAL PROTECTIONS OR REDUCTIONS IN

THE LEGAL PROTECTION FOR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS OF SOFTWARE DEVELOPERS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT REVENUE.

FROM TIME TO TIME WE RECEIVE NOTICES

FROM OTHERS CLAIMING WE INFRINGE THEIR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS. THE NUMBER OF THESE CLAIMS MAY GROW. RESPONDING TO THESE CLAIMS MAY REQUIRE US TO ENTER INTO ROYALTY AND LICENSING AGREEMENTS ON UNFAVORABLE TERMS, REQUIRE US TO STOP SELLING OR TO

REDESIGN AFFECTED PRODUCTS, OR TO PAY DAMAGES OR TO SATISFY INDEMNIFICATION COMMITMENTS WITH OUR CUSTOMERS.

WE HAVE MADE AND EXPECT TO CONTINUE

MAKING SIGNIFICANT EXPENDITURES TO ACQUIRE THE USE OF TECHNOLOGY AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS, INCLUDING VIA CROSS-LICENSES OF BROAD PATENT PORTFOLIOS.

NEW PRODUCTS AND SERVICES

WE HAVE MADE SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS IN RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT AND MARKETING FOR NEW PRODUCTS, SERVICES AND TECHNOLOGIES, INCLUDING MICROSOFT .NET, XBOX, BUSINESS APPLICATIONS, MSN, MOBILE AND WIRELESS TECHNOLOGIES, AND

TELEVISION. SIGNIFICANT REVENUE FROM NEW PRODUCT AND SERVICE INVESTMENTS MAY NOT BE ACHIEVED FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS, IF AT ALL. MOREOVER, THESE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES MAY NEVER BE PROFITABLE, AND EVEN IF THEY ARE PROFITABLE, OPERATING MARGINS FOR

THESE BUSINESSES ARE NOT EXPECTED TO BE AS HIGH AS THE MARGINS HISTORICALLY EXPERIENCED BY US.

LITIGATION

AS DISCUSSED IN NOTE 20  CONTINGENCIES OF THE

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, WE ARE SUBJECT TO A VARIETY OF CLAIMS AND LAWSUITS. WHILE WE BELIEVE THAT NONE OF THE LITIGATION MATTERS IN WHICH WE ARE CURRENTLY INVOLVED WILL HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR FINANCIAL POSITION OR RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT ONE OR MORE OF THESE MATTERS COULD BE RESOLVED IN A MANNER THAT ULTIMATELY WOULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR BUSINESS, AND COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR REVENUES, OPERATING MARGINS, AND NET INCOME.

DECLINES IN DEMAND FOR SOFTWARE

IF OVERALL MARKET DEMAND FOR PCS, SERVERS AND OTHER COMPUTING DEVICES DECLINES SIGNIFICANTLY, OR

CONSUMER OR CORPORATE SPENDING FOR SUCH PRODUCTS DECLINES, OUR REVENUE WILL BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED. ADDITIONALLY, OUR REVENUES WOULD BE UNFAVORABLY IMPACTED IF CUSTOMERS REDUCE THEIR PURCHASES OF NEW SOFTWARE PRODUCTS OR UPGRADES TO EXISTING PRODUCTS

BECAUSE NEW PRODUCT OFFERINGS ARE NOT PERCEIVED AS ADDING SIGNIFICANT NEW FUNCTIONALITY OR OTHER VALUE TO PROSPECTIVE PURCHASERS. A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF CUSTOMERS PURCHASED LICENSE AGREEMENTS PROVIDING UPGRADE RIGHTS TO SPECIFIC LICENSED PRODUCTS

PRIOR TO THE TRANSITION TO LICENSING 6.0 IN JULY 2002. THESE AGREEMENTS WILL EXPIRE IN 2004 AND 2005 AND THE RATE AT WHICH SUCH CUSTOMERS RENEW THESE CONTRACTS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT FUTURE REVENUES. WE ARE ALSO COMMITTING SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS IN

THE NEXT RELEASE OF THE WINDOWS OPERATING SYSTEM, CODENAMED LONGHORN. IF THIS SYSTEM IS NOT PERCEIVED AS OFFERING SIGNIFICANT NEW FUNCTIONALITY OR VALUE TO PROSPECTIVE PURCHASERS, OUR REVENUES AND OPERATING MARGINS COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT SCHEDULE

THE DEVELOPMENT OF SOFTWARE PRODUCTS IS A COMPLEX AND TIME-CONSUMING PROCESS. NEW PRODUCTS AND

ENHANCEMENTS TO EXISTING PRODUCTS CAN REQUIRE LONG DEVELOPMENT AND TESTING PERIODS. SIGNIFICANT DELAYS IN NEW PRODUCT RELEASES OR SIGNIFICANT PROBLEMS IN CREATING NEW PRODUCTS, PARTICULARLY ANY DELAYS IN THE LONGHORN OPERATING SYSTEM, COULD

ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR REVENUES.

GENERAL ECONOMIC AND GEO-POLITICAL RISKS

CONTINUED SOFTNESS IN CORPORATE INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SPENDING OR OTHER CHANGES IN

GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS THAT AFFECT DEMAND FOR COMPUTER HARDWARE OR SOFTWARE COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR REVENUES. TERRORIST ACTIVITY AND ARMED CONFLICT POSE THE ADDITIONAL RISK OF GENERAL ECONOMIC DISRUPTION AND COULD REQUIRE CHANGES IN OUR

INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS AND SECURITY ARRANGEMENTS, THUS INCREASING OUR OPERATING COSTS. THESE CONDITIONS LEND ADDITIONAL UNCERTAINTY TO THE TIMING AND BUDGET FOR TECHNOLOGY INVESTMENT DECISIONS BY OUR CUSTOMERS.

COMPETITION

WE CONTINUE TO EXPERIENCE INTENSIVE COMPETITION ACROSS ALL MARKETS FOR OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. THESE COMPETITIVE PRESSURES MAY RESULT IN DECREASED

SALES VOLUMES, PRICE REDUCTIONS, AND/OR INCREASED OPERATING COSTS, SUCH AS FOR MARKETING AND SALES INCENTIVES, RESULTING IN LOWER REVENUES, GROSS MARGINS AND OPERATING INCOME.

TAXATION OF EXTRATERRITORIAL INCOME

IN AUGUST 2001, A WORLD TRADE ORGANIZATION (WTO) DISPUTE PANEL DETERMINED THAT THE TAX PROVISIONS OF THE FSC REPEAL AND EXTRATERRITORIAL INCOME EXCLUSION ACT OF 2000

(ETI) CONSTITUTE AN EXPORT SUBSIDY PROHIBITED BY THE WTO AGREEMENT ON SUBSIDIES

17  /  MSFT

2003 FORM 10-K

TABLE OF CONTENTS

PART II, ITEM 7, 7A

AND COUNTERVAILING MEASURES. THE U.S. GOVERNMENT APPEALED THE PANELS DECISION AND LOST ITS APPEAL. IF THE ETI PROVISIONS ARE REPEALED AND FINANCIALLY COMPARABLE

REPLACEMENT TAX LEGISLATION IS NOT ENACTED, THE LOSS OF THE ETI TAX BENEFIT TO US COULD BE SIGNIFICANT.

OTHER POTENTIAL TAX LIABILITIES

WE ARE SUBJECT TO

INCOME TAXES IN BOTH THE UNITED STATES AND NUMEROUS FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS. SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT IS REQUIRED IN DETERMINING OUR WORLDWIDE PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES. IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF OUR BUSINESS, THERE ARE MANY TRANSACTIONS AND CALCULATIONS

WHERE THE ULTIMATE TAX DETERMINATION IS UNCERTAIN. WE ARE REGULARLY UNDER AUDIT BY TAX AUTHORITIES. ALTHOUGH WE BELIEVE OUR TAX ESTIMATES ARE REASONABLE, THE FINAL DETERMINATION OF TAX AUDITS AND ANY RELATED LITIGATION COULD BE MATERIALLY DIFFERENT

THAN THAT WHICH IS REFLECTED IN HISTORICAL INCOME TAX PROVISIONS AND ACCRUALS. SHOULD ADDITIONAL TAXES BE ASSESSED AS A RESULT OF AN AUDIT OR LITIGATION, A MATERIAL EFFECT ON OUR INCOME TAX PROVISION AND NET INCOME IN THE PERIOD OR PERIODS FOR WHICH

THAT DETERMINATION IS MADE COULD RESULT.

FINITE INSURANCE PROGRAMS

IN ADDITION TO CONVENTIONAL THIRD PARTY INSURANCE ARRANGEMENTS, WE HAVE ENTERED INTO

CAPTIVE INSURANCE ARRANGEMENTS FOR THE PURPOSE OF PROTECTING AGAINST POSSIBLE CATASTROPHIC AND OTHER RISKS NOT COVERED BY TRADITIONAL INSURANCE MARKETS. AS OF JUNE 30, 2003, POTENTIAL COVERAGE AVAILABLE UNDER CAPTIVE INSURANCE ARRANGEMENTS WAS $1.0

BILLION, SUBJECT TO DEDUCTIBLES, EXCLUSIONS, AND OTHER RESTRICTIONS. WHILE WE BELIEVE THESE ARRANGEMENTS ARE AN EFFECTIVE WAY TO INSURE AGAINST SUCH RISKS, THE POTENTIAL LIABILITIES ASSOCIATED WITH CERTAIN OF THE ISSUES AND UNCERTAINTIES DISCUSSED

HEREIN COULD EXCEED THE COVERAGE PROVIDED BY SUCH ARRANGEMENTS.

OTHER

OTHER ISSUES AND UNCERTAINTIES MAY INCLUDE.

·

WARRANTY AND OTHER CLAIMS FOR HARDWARE PRODUCTS SUCH AS XBOX;

·

THE EFFECTS OF THE CONSENT DECREE IN

U.S. V. MICROSOFT

AND FINAL JUDGMENT IN STATE OF

NEW YORK V. MICROSOFT

ON THE WINDOWS OPERATING SYSTEM AND SERVER BUSINESS, INCLUDING THOSE

ASSOCIATED WITH PROTOCOL AND OTHER DISCLOSURES REQUIRED BY THE DECREE AND FINAL JUDGMENT AND THE ABILITY OF PC MANUFACTURERS TO HIDE END USER ACCESS TO CERTAIN NEW WINDOWS FEATURES;

·

THE CONTINUED AVAILABILITY OF THIRD PARTY DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS FOR MSN SERVICE AND OTHER ONLINE SERVICES;

·

FACTORS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS, AS DESCRIBED UNDER INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS IN PART I, ITEM 1 OF THIS REPORT; AND

·

FINANCIAL MARKET VOLATILITY OR OTHER CHANGES AFFECTING THE VALUE OF OUR INVESTMENTS, SUCH AS THE COMCAST CORPORATION SECURITIES HELD BY US, THAT MAY RESULT IN A REDUCTION IN CARRYING VALUE

AND RECOGNITION OF LOSSES INCLUDING IMPAIRMENT CHARGES.

ITEM 7A.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

WE

ARE EXPOSED TO FOREIGN CURRENCY, INTEREST RATE, AND FIXED INCOME AND EQUITY PRICE RISKS. A PORTION OF THESE RISKS IS HEDGED, BUT FLUCTUATIONS COULD IMPACT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL POSITION. WE HEDGE A PORTION OF ANTICIPATED REVENUE

AND ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE EXPOSURE TO FOREIGN CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS, PRIMARILY WITH OPTION CONTRACTS. WE MONITOR OUR FOREIGN CURRENCY EXPOSURES DAILY TO MAXIMIZE THE OVERALL EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR FOREIGN CURRENCY HEDGE POSITIONS. PRINCIPAL CURRENCIES

HEDGED INCLUDE THE EURO, JAPANESE YEN, BRITISH POUND, AND CANADIAN DOLLAR. FIXED INCOME SECURITIES ARE SUBJECT TO INTEREST RATE RISK. THE PORTFOLIO IS DIVERSIFIED AND STRUCTURED TO MINIMIZE CREDIT RISK. WE ROUTINELY USE OPTIONS TO HEDGE A PORTION OF

OUR EXPOSURE TO INTEREST RATE RISK IN THE EVENT OF A CATASTROPHIC INCREASE IN INTEREST RATES. SECURITIES HELD IN OUR EQUITY AND OTHER INVESTMENTS PORTFOLIO ARE SUBJECT TO PRICE RISK, AND ARE GENERALLY NOT HEDGED. HOWEVER, WE USE OPTIONS TO HEDGE OUR

PRICE RISK ON CERTAIN HIGHLY VOLATILE EQUITY SECURITIES THAT ARE HELD PRIMARILY FOR STRATEGIC PURPOSES.

WE USE A VALUE-AT-RISK (VAR) MODEL TO

ESTIMATE AND QUANTIFY OUR MARKET RISKS. VAR IS THE EXPECTED LOSS, FOR A GIVEN CONFIDENCE LEVEL, IN FAIR VALUE OF OUR PORTFOLIO DUE TO ADVERSE MARKET MOVEMENTS OVER A DEFINED TIME HORIZON. THE VAR MODEL IS NOT INTENDED TO REPRESENT ACTUAL LOSSES IN

FAIR VALUE, BUT IS USED AS A RISK ESTIMATION AND MANAGEMENT TOOL. THE MODEL USED FOR CURRENCIES AND EQUITIES IS GEOMETRIC BROWNIAN MOTION, WHICH ALLOWS INCORPORATION OF OPTIONALITY WITH REGARD TO THESE RISK EXPOSURES. FOR INTEREST RATE RISK, THE

MEAN REVERTING GEOMETRIC BROWNIAN MOTION IS USED TO REFLECT THE PRINCIPLE THAT FIXED-INCOME SECURITIES PRICES REVERT TO MATURITY VALUE OVER TIME.

VALUE-AT-RISK IS CALCULATED BY, FIRST, SIMULATING 10,000 MARKET PRICE PATHS OVER 20 DAYS FOR EQUITIES, INTEREST RATES AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES, TAKING INTO ACCOUNT HISTORICAL CORRELATIONS AMONG THE DIFFERENT RATES AND PRICES. EACH

RESULTING UNIQUE SET OF EQUITIES PRICES, INTEREST RATES, AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES IS APPLIED TO SUBSTANTIALLY ALL INDIVIDUAL HOLDINGS TO RE-PRICE EACH HOLDING. THE 250

TH

WORST PERFORMANCE (OUT OF 10,000) REPRESENTS THE VALUE-AT-RISK

OVER 20 DAYS AT THE 97.5

TH

PERCENTILE CONFIDENCE LEVEL. SEVERAL RISK FACTORS ARE NOT CAPTURED IN THE MODEL, INCLUDING LIQUIDITY RISK, OPERATIONAL RISK, CREDIT RISK, AND LEGAL RISK.

CERTAIN SECURITIES IN OUR EQUITY PORTFOLIO ARE HELD FOR STRATEGIC PURPOSES. WE HEDGE THE VALUE OF A PORTION OF THESE SECURITIES THROUGH THE USE OF DERIVATIVE

CONTRACTS SUCH AS PUT-CALL COLLARS. IN THESE ARRANGEMENTS, WE HEDGE A SECURITYS MARKET RISK BELOW THE PURCHASED PUT STRIKE AND FORGO MOST OR ALL OF THE BENEFITS OF THE SECURITYS APPRECIATION ABOVE THE SOLD CALL STRIKE, IN EXCHANGE FOR

PREMIUM RECEIVED FOR THE SOLD CALL. WE ALSO HOLD EQUITY SECURITIES FOR GENERAL INVESTMENT RETURN PURPOSES. WE HAVE INCURRED MATERIAL IMPAIRMENT CHARGES RELATED TO THESE SECURITIES. THE VAR AMOUNTS DISCLOSED BELOW ARE USED AS A RISK MANAGEMENT TOOL

AND REFLECT AN ESTIMATE OF POTENTIAL REDUCTIONS IN FAIR VALUE OF OUR PORTFOLIO. LOSSES IN FAIR VALUE OVER A 20-DAY HOLDING PERIOD CAN EXCEED THE REPORTED VAR BY SIGNIFICANT AMOUNTS AND CAN ALSO ACCUMULATE OVER A LONGER TIME HORIZON THAN THE 20-DAY

HOLDING PERIOD USED IN THE VAR ANALYSIS. VAR AMOUNTS ARE NOT NECESSARILY REFLECTIVE OF POTENTIAL ACCOUNTING LOSSES, INCLUDING DETERMINATIONS OF OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY LOSSES IN FAIR VALUE IN ACCORDANCE WITH U.S. GAAP.

THE VAR NUMBERS ARE SHOWN SEPARATELY FOR INTEREST RATE, CURRENCY, AND EQUITY RISKS. THESE VAR NUMBERS INCLUDE THE UNDERLYING PORTFOLIO POSITIONS AND RELATED HEDGES.

WE USE HISTORICAL DATA TO ESTIMATE VAR. GIVEN RELIANCE ON HISTORICAL DATA, VAR IS MOST EFFECTIVE IN ESTIMATING RISK EXPOSURES IN MARKETS IN WHICH THERE ARE NO FUNDAMENTAL CHANGES OR SHIFTS IN MARKET CONDITIONS. AN INHERENT LIMITATION IN VAR IS THAT

THE DISTRIBUTION OF PAST CHANGES IN MARKET RISK FACTORS MAY NOT PRODUCE ACCURATE PREDICTIONS OF FUTURE MARKET RISK.

PART II, ITEM 8

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 1ACCOUNTING POLICIES

ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES

THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND ACCOMPANYING NOTES ARE PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.

PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION

THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDE THE ACCOUNTS OF MICROSOFT CORPORATION AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES (MICROSOFT). INTERCOMPANY TRANSACTIONS AND BALANCES HAVE BEEN ELIMINATED. EQUITY

INVESTMENTS IN WHICH WE OWN AT LEAST 20% OF THE VOTING SECURITIES ARE ACCOUNTED FOR USING THE EQUITY METHOD, EXCEPT FOR INVESTMENTS IN WHICH THE COMPANY IS NOT ABLE TO EXERCISE SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE OVER THE INVESTEE, IN WHICH CASE, THE COST METHOD

OF ACCOUNTING IS USED.

ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS

PREPARING FINANCIAL STATEMENTS REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT THE

REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS, LIABILITIES, REVENUE, AND EXPENSES. EXAMPLES INCLUDE ESTIMATES OF LOSS CONTINGENCIES AND PRODUCT LIFE CYCLES, AND ASSUMPTIONS SUCH AS THE ELEMENTS COMPRISING A SOFTWARE ARRANGEMENT, INCLUDING THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN

UPGRADE/ENHANCEMENTS AND NEW PRODUCTS; WHEN TECHNOLOGICAL FEASIBILITY IS ACHIEVED FOR OUR PRODUCTS; THE POTENTIAL OUTCOME OF FUTURE TAX CONSEQUENCES OF EVENTS THAT HAVE BEEN RECOGNIZED IN OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OR TAX RETURNS; AND DETERMINING WHEN

INVESTMENT IMPAIRMENTS ARE OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY. ACTUAL RESULTS AND OUTCOMES MAY DIFFER FROM MANAGEMENTS ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS.

FOREIGN CURRENCIES

ASSETS AND LIABILITIES RECORDED IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES ARE TRANSLATED AT THE EXCHANGE RATE ON THE BALANCE SHEET DATE. REVENUE AND EXPENSES ARE TRANSLATED AT AVERAGE RATES OF EXCHANGE PREVAILING DURING THE YEAR. TRANSLATION

ADJUSTMENTS RESULTING FROM THIS PROCESS ARE CHARGED OR CREDITED TO OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (OCI).

REVENUE RECOGNITION

REVENUE FOR RETAIL PACKAGED

PRODUCTS, PRODUCTS LICENSED TO ORIGINAL EQUIPMENT MANUFACTURERS (OEMS), AND PERPETUAL LICENSES FOR CURRENT PRODUCTS UNDER OUR OPEN AND SELECT VOLUME LICENSING PROGRAMS IS GENERALLY RECOGNIZED AS PRODUCTS ARE SHIPPED, WITH A PORTION OF THE REVENUE

RECORDED AS UNEARNED DUE TO UNDELIVERED ELEMENTS INCLUDING, IN SOME CASES, FREE POST-DELIVERY TELEPHONE SUPPORT AND THE RIGHT TO RECEIVE UNSPECIFIED UPGRADES/ENHANCEMENTS OF MICROSOFT INTERNET EXPLORER ON A WHEN-AND-IF-AVAILABLE BASIS. THE AMOUNT OF

REVENUE ALLOCATED TO UNDELIVERED ELEMENTS IS BASED ON THE SALES PRICE OF THOSE ELEMENTS WHEN SOLD SEPARATELY (VENDOR-SPECIFIC OBJECTIVE EVIDENCE) USING THE RESIDUAL METHOD. UNDER THE RESIDUAL METHOD, THE TOTAL FAIR VALUE OF THE UNDELIVERED ELEMENTS,

AS INDICATED BY VENDOR-SPECIFIC OBJECTIVE EVIDENCE, IS RECORDED AS UNEARNED, AND THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TOTAL ARRANGEMENT FEE AND THE AMOUNT RECORDED AS UNEARNED FOR THE UNDELIVERED ELEMENTS IS RECOGNIZED AS REVENUE RELATED TO DELIVERED

ELEMENTS. UNEARNED REVENUE DUE TO UNDELIVERED ELEMENTS IS RECOGNIZED RATABLY ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THE RELATED PRODUCTS LIFE CYCLE, WHICH IS CURRENTLY ESTIMATED AT THREE AND A HALF YEARS FOR WINDOWS OPERATING SYSTEMS AND TWO YEARS FOR

DESKTOP APPLICATIONS (PRIMARILY OFFICE).

REVENUE FROM MULTI-YEAR LICENSING ARRANGEMENTS ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AS SUBSCRIPTIONS, WITH BILLINGS RECORDED AS

UNEARNED REVENUE AND RECOGNIZED AS REVENUE RATABLY OVER THE BILLING COVERAGE PERIOD. CERTAIN MULTI-YEAR LICENSING ARRANGEMENTS INCLUDE RIGHTS TO RECEIVE FUTURE VERSIONS OF SOFTWARE PRODUCT ON A WHEN-AND-IF-AVAILABLE BASIS UNDER OPEN AND SELECT

VOLUME LICENSING PROGRAMS (CURRENTLY NAMED SOFTWARE ASSURANCE AND, PREVIOUSLY, UPGRADE ADVANTAGE). IN ADDITION, OTHER MULTI-YEAR LICENSING ARRANGEMENTS INCLUDE A PERPETUAL LICENSE FOR CURRENT PRODUCTS COMBINED WITH RIGHTS TO RECEIVE FUTURE VERSIONS

OF SOFTWARE PRODUCTS ON A WHEN-AND-IF-AVAILABLE BASIS UNDER OPEN, SELECT, AND ENTERPRISE AGREEMENT VOLUME LICENSING PROGRAMS. MSN INTERNET ACCESS SUBSCRIPTIONS, MICROSOFT BCENTRAL SUBSCRIPTIONS, AND MICROSOFT DEVELOPER NETWORK SUBSCRIPTIONS ARE ALSO

ACCOUNTED FOR AS SUBSCRIPTIONS.

REVENUE RELATED TO OUR XBOX GAME CONSOLE IS RECOGNIZED UPON SHIPMENT OF THE PRODUCT TO RETAILERS. ONLINE ADVERTISING

REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED AS ADVERTISEMENTS ARE DISPLAYED. CONSULTING SERVICES REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED AS SERVICES ARE RENDERED, GENERALLY BASED ON THE NEGOTIATED HOURLY RATE IN THE CONSULTING ARRANGEMENT AND THE NUMBER OF HOURS WORKED DURING THE PERIOD.

COSTS RELATED TO INSIGNIFICANT OBLIGATIONS, WHICH INCLUDE TELEPHONE SUPPORT FOR DEVELOPER TOOLS SOFTWARE, PC GAMES, COMPUTER HARDWARE, AND XBOX, ARE

ACCRUED WHEN THE RELATED REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED. PROVISIONS ARE RECORDED FOR ESTIMATED RETURNS, CONCESSIONS, AND BAD DEBTS.

COST OF REVENUE

COST OF REVENUE INCLUDES MANUFACTURING AND DISTRIBUTION COSTS FOR PRODUCTS AND PROGRAMS SOLD, OPERATION COSTS RELATED TO PRODUCT SUPPORT SERVICE CENTERS AND PRODUCT DISTRIBUTION CENTERS, COSTS INCURRED TO SUPPORT AND MAINTAIN

INTERNET-BASED PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, AND COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE DELIVERY OF CONSULTING SERVICES.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

EXPENSES INCLUDE PAYROLL, EMPLOYEE BENEFITS, AND OTHER HEADCOUNT-RELATED COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT. TECHNOLOGICAL FEASIBILITY FOR OUR SOFTWARE PRODUCTS IS REACHED SHORTLY BEFORE THE PRODUCTS ARE RELEASED TO MANUFACTURING. COSTS

INCURRED AFTER TECHNOLOGICAL FEASIBILITY IS ESTABLISHED ARE NOT MATERIAL, AND ACCORDINGLY, WE EXPENSE ALL RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS WHEN INCURRED.

SALES AND MARKETING

SALES AND MARKETING EXPENSES INCLUDE PAYROLL, EMPLOYEE BENEFITS, AND OTHER HEADCOUNT-RELATED COSTS AS WELL AS EXPENSES RELATED TO ADVERTISING, PROMOTIONS, TRADESHOWS, SEMINARS, AND

OTHER PROGRAMS. ADVERTISING COSTS ARE EXPENSED AS INCURRED. ADVERTISING EXPENSE WAS $1.02 BILLION IN 2001, $1.13 BILLION IN 2002, AND $1.06 BILLION IN 2003.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

PART II, ITEM 8

INCOME TAXES

INCOME TAX EXPENSE INCLUDES U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL INCOME TAXES, PLUS THE PROVISION FOR U.S. TAXES ON UNDISTRIBUTED EARNINGS OF INTERNATIONAL

SUBSIDIARIES NOT DEEMED TO BE PERMANENTLY INVESTED. CERTAIN ITEMS OF INCOME AND EXPENSE ARE NOT REPORTED IN TAX RETURNS AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN THE SAME YEAR. THE TAX EFFECT OF SUCH TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES IS REPORTED AS DEFERRED INCOME TAXES.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

WE CONSIDER ALL HIGHLY LIQUID INTEREST-EARNING INVESTMENTS WITH A MATURITY OF THREE MONTHS OR LESS AT

THE DATE OF PURCHASE TO BE CASH EQUIVALENTS. SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS GENERALLY MATURE BETWEEN THREE MONTHS TO NINE YEARS FROM THE PURCHASE DATE. INVESTMENTS WITH MATURITIES BEYOND ONE YEAR MAY BE CLASSIFIED AS SHORT-TERM BASED ON THEIR HIGHLY LIQUID

NATURE AND BECAUSE SUCH MARKETABLE SECURITIES REPRESENT THE INVESTMENT OF CASH THAT IS AVAILABLE FOR CURRENT OPERATIONS. ALL CASH AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS ARE CLASSIFIED AS AVAILABLE FOR SALE AND ARE RECORDED AT MARKET VALUE USING THE SPECIFIC

IDENTIFICATION METHOD; UNREALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES ARE REFLECTED IN OCI.

EQUITY AND OTHER INVESTMENTS INCLUDE DEBT AND EQUITY INSTRUMENTS. DEBT

SECURITIES AND PUBLICLY TRADED EQUITY SECURITIES ARE CLASSIFIED AS AVAILABLE FOR SALE AND ARE RECORDED AT MARKET USING THE SPECIFIC IDENTIFICATION METHOD. UNREALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES (EXCLUDING OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENTS) ARE REFLECTED IN OCI.

ALL OTHER INVESTMENTS, EXCLUDING THOSE ACCOUNTED FOR USING THE EQUITY METHOD, ARE RECORDED AT COST.

WE LEND CERTAIN FIXED INCOME AND EQUITY

SECURITIES TO ENHANCE INVESTMENT INCOME. COLLATERAL AND/OR SECURITY INTEREST IS DETERMINED BASED UPON THE UNDERLYING SECURITY AND THE CREDITWORTHINESS OF THE BORROWER. THE FAIR VALUE OF COLLATERAL THAT WE ARE PERMITTED TO SELL OR REPLEDGE WAS $499

MILLION AT BOTH JUNE 30, 2002 AND 2003.

INVESTMENTS ARE CONSIDERED TO BE IMPAIRED WHEN A DECLINE IN FAIR VALUE IS JUDGED TO BE OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY.

WE EMPLOY A SYSTEMATIC METHODOLOGY THAT CONSIDERS AVAILABLE EVIDENCE IN EVALUATING POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT OF OUR INVESTMENTS. IF THE COST OF AN INVESTMENT EXCEEDS ITS FAIR VALUE, WE EVALUATE, AMONG OTHER FACTORS, GENERAL MARKET CONDITIONS, THE

DURATION AND EXTENT TO WHICH THE FAIR VALUE IS LESS THAN COST, AS WELL AS OUR INTENT AND ABILITY TO HOLD THE INVESTMENT. WE ALSO CONSIDER SPECIFIC ADVERSE CONDITIONS RELATED TO THE FINANCIAL HEALTH OF AND BUSINESS OUTLOOK FOR THE INVESTEE, INCLUDING

INDUSTRY AND SECTOR PERFORMANCE, CHANGES IN TECHNOLOGY, OPERATIONAL AND FINANCING CASH FLOW FACTORS, AND RATING AGENCY ACTIONS. ONCE A DECLINE IN FAIR VALUE IS DETERMINED TO BE OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY, AN IMPAIRMENT CHARGE IS RECORDED AND A NEW COST

BASIS IN THE INVESTMENT IS ESTABLISHED.

WE USE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS TO MANAGE EXPOSURES TO FOREIGN CURRENCY, SECURITY PRICE, INTEREST RATE, AND

CREDIT RISKS. OUR OBJECTIVES FOR HOLDING DERIVATIVES INCLUDE REDUCING, ELIMINATING, AND EFFICIENTLY MANAGING THE IMPACT OF THESE EXPOSURES AS EFFECTIVELY AS POSSIBLE.

FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK.

CERTAIN FORECASTED TRANSACTIONS AND ASSETS ARE EXPOSED TO FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK. WE

MONITOR OUR FOREIGN CURRENCY EXPOSURES DAILY TO MAXIMIZE THE OVERALL EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR FOREIGN CURRENCY HEDGE POSITIONS. PRINCIPAL CURRENCIES HEDGED INCLUDE THE EURO, JAPANESE YEN, BRITISH POUND, AND CANADIAN DOLLAR. NON U.S. DOLLAR DENOMINATED

SECURITIES ARE HEDGED USING FOREIGN EXCHANGE FORWARD CONTRACTS THAT ARE DESIGNATED AS FAIR VALUE HEDGING INSTRUMENTS UNDER SFAS 133. OPTIONS USED TO HEDGE A PORTION OF FORECASTED INTERNATIONAL REVENUE FOR UP TO THREE YEARS IN THE FUTURE ARE

DESIGNATED AS CASH FLOW HEDGING INSTRUMENTS. CERTAIN OPTIONS AND FORWARDS NOT DESIGNATED AS HEDGING INSTRUMENTS UNDER SFAS 133 ARE ALSO USED TO HEDGE THE IMPACT OF THE VARIABILITY IN EXCHANGE RATES ON ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND COLLECTIONS DENOMINATED

IN CERTAIN FOREIGN CURRENCIES.

SECURITIES PRICE

RISK.

STRATEGIC EQUITY INVESTMENTS ARE SUBJECT TO MARKET PRICE RISK. FROM TIME TO TIME, WE USE AND DESIGNATE OPTIONS TO HEDGE FAIR VALUES AND CASH FLOWS ON CERTAIN EQUITY SECURITIES. WE DETERMINE THE SECURITY, OR

FORECASTED SALE THEREOF, SELECTED FOR HEDGING BY MARKET CONDITIONS, UP-FRONT COSTS, AND OTHER RELEVANT FACTORS. ONCE ESTABLISHED, THE HEDGES ARE NOT DYNAMICALLY MANAGED OR TRADED, AND ARE GENERALLY NOT REMOVED UNTIL MATURITY.

INTEREST RATE RISK.

FIXED-INCOME SECURITIES ARE SUBJECT TO

INTEREST RATE RISK. THE FIXED-INCOME PORTFOLIO IS DIVERSIFIED AND CONSISTS PRIMARILY OF INVESTMENT GRADE SECURITIES TO MINIMIZE CREDIT RISK. WE USE EXCHANGE-TRADED OPTION AND FUTURE CONTRACTS, NOT DESIGNATED AS HEDGING INSTRUMENTS UNDER SFAS 133, TO

HEDGE INTEREST RATE RISK. IN ADDITION, WE ROUTINELY USE OPTIONS, NOT DESIGNATED AS HEDGING INSTRUMENTS UNDER SFAS 133, TO HEDGE OUR EXPOSURE TO INTEREST RATE RISK IN THE EVENT OF A CATASTROPHIC INCREASE IN INTEREST RATES.

OTHER DERIVATIVES.

SWAP CONTRACTS, NOT DESIGNATED AS HEDGING

INSTRUMENTS UNDER SFAS 133, ARE USED TO MANAGE EXPOSURES TO CREDIT RISKS. IN ADDITION, WE MAY INVEST IN WARRANTS TO PURCHASE SECURITIES OF OTHER COMPANIES AS A STRATEGIC INVESTMENT. WARRANTS THAT CAN BE NET SHARE SETTLED ARE DEEMED DERIVATIVE

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND ARE NOT DESIGNATED AS HEDGING INSTRUMENTS. TO BE ANNOUNCED FORWARD PURCHASE COMMITMENTS OF MORTGAGE-BACKED ASSETS ARE ALSO CONSIDERED DERIVATIVES IN CASES WHERE PHYSICAL DELIVERY OF THE ASSETS ARE NOT TAKEN AT THE EARLIEST

AVAILABLE DELIVERY DATE.

FOR OPTIONS DESIGNATED EITHER AS FAIR VALUE OR CASH FLOW HEDGES, CHANGES IN THE TIME VALUE ARE EXCLUDED FROM THE ASSESSMENT

OF HEDGE EFFECTIVENESS.

GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS,

GOODWILL IS NO LONGER AMORTIZED, BUT INSTEAD TESTED FOR IMPAIRMENT AT LEAST ANNUALLY. PRIOR TO FISCAL 2002, GOODWILL WAS AMORTIZED USING THE STRAIGHT-LINE METHOD OVER ITS ESTIMATED PERIOD OF

BENEFIT.

INTANGIBLE ASSETS

INTANGIBLE ASSETS ARE AMORTIZED USING THE STRAIGHT-LINE METHOD OVER THEIR ESTIMATED PERIOD OF BENEFIT,

RANGING FROM ONE TO TEN YEARS. WE PERIODICALLY EVALUATE THE RECOVERABILITY OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND TAKE INTO ACCOUNT EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES THAT WARRANT REVISED ESTIMATES OF USEFUL LIVES OR THAT INDICATE THAT AN IMPAIRMENT EXISTS. ALL OF OUR

INTANGIBLE ASSETS ARE SUBJECT TO AMORTIZATION.

EMPLOYEE STOCK PLANS

WE FOLLOW ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES BOARD OPINION 25,

ACCOUNTING FOR STOCK

ISSUED TO EMPLOYEES,

TO ACCOUNT FOR STOCK OPTION AND EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLANS, WHICH GENERALLY DOES NOT REQUIRE INCOME STATEMENT RECOGNITION OF OPTIONS GRANTED AT THE MARKET PRICE ON THE DATE OF ISSUANCE. HOWEVER, CERTAIN EVENTS, SUCH AS

THE ACCELERATED VESTING OF OPTIONS AND THE EXCHANGE OF OPTIONS IN A BUSINESS COMBINATION, CAN TRIGGER RECORDING AN EXPENSE. IN ADDITION TO ANNOUNCING CHANGES TO OUR EMPLOYEE COMPENSATION ARRANGEMENTS IN JULY 2003, WE ALSO INDICATED THAT WE WILL

ADOPT THE FAIR VALUE RECOGNITION PROVISIONS OF SFAS 123,

NOTE

3ACCOUNTING CHANGES

EFFECTIVE JULY 1, 2000, WE ADOPTED SFAS 133 WHICH

ESTABLISHES ACCOUNTING AND REPORTING STANDARDS FOR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS, INCLUDING CERTAIN DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS EMBEDDED IN OTHER CONTRACTS AND FOR HEDGING ACTIVITIES. THE ADOPTION OF SFAS 133 ON JULY 1, 2000, RESULTED IN A CUMULATIVE

PRE-TAX REDUCTION TO INCOME OF $560 MILLION ($375 MILLION AFTER-TAX) AND A CUMULATIVE PRE-TAX

25  /  MSFT

2003 FORM 10-K

TABLE OF CONTENTS

PART II, ITEM 8

REDUCTION TO OCI OF $112 MILLION ($75 MILLION AFTER-TAX). THE REDUCTION TO INCOME WAS MOSTLY ATTRIBUTABLE TO A LOSS OF APPROXIMATELY $300 MILLION RECLASSIFIED FROM OCI

FOR THE TIME VALUE OF OPTIONS AND A LOSS OF APPROXIMATELY $250 MILLION RECLASSIFIED FROM OCI FOR DERIVATIVES NOT DESIGNATED AS HEDGING INSTRUMENTS. THE REDUCTION TO OCI WAS MOSTLY ATTRIBUTABLE TO LOSSES OF APPROXIMATELY $670 MILLION ON CASH

FLOW HEDGES OFFSET BY RECLASSIFICATIONS OUT OF OCI OF THE APPROXIMATELY $300 MILLION LOSS FOR THE TIME VALUE OF OPTIONS AND THE APPROXIMATELY $250 MILLION LOSS FOR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS NOT DESIGNATED AS HEDGING INSTRUMENTS. THE NET DERIVATIVE

LOSSES INCLUDED IN OCI AS OF JULY 1, 2000 WERE RECLASSIFIED INTO EARNINGS DURING THE TWELVE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2001. THE CHANGE IN ACCOUNTING FROM THE ADOPTION OF SFAS 133 DID NOT MATERIALLY AFFECT NET INCOME IN 2001.

EFFECTIVE JULY 1, 2001, WE ADOPTED SFAS 141,

BUSINESS COMBINATIONS,

AND SFAS 142. SFAS 141 REQUIRES BUSINESS COMBINATIONS INITIATED AFTER JUNE 30, 2001 TO BE

ACCOUNTED FOR USING THE PURCHASE METHOD OF ACCOUNTING. IT ALSO SPECIFIES THE TYPES OF ACQUIRED INTANGIBLE ASSETS THAT ARE REQUIRED TO BE RECOGNIZED AND REPORTED SEPARATE FROM GOODWILL. SFAS 142 REQUIRES THAT GOODWILL AND CERTAIN INTANGIBLES NO

LONGER BE AMORTIZED, BUT INSTEAD TESTED FOR IMPAIRMENT AT LEAST ANNUALLY. THERE WAS NO IMPAIRMENT OF GOODWILL UPON ADOPTION OF SFAS 142.

NOTE 4UNEARNED REVENUE

UNEARNED REVENUE FROM VOLUME LICENSING PROGRAMS REPRESENTS CUSTOMER BILLINGS, PAID EITHER UPFRONT

OR ANNUALLY AT THE BEGINNING OF EACH BILLING COVERAGE PERIOD, WHICH ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AS SUBSCRIPTIONS WITH REVENUE RECOGNIZED RATABLY OVER THE BILLING COVERAGE PERIOD. FOR CERTAIN OTHER LICENSING ARRANGEMENTS REVENUE ATTRIBUTABLE TO UNDELIVERED

ELEMENTS, INCLUDING FREE POST-DELIVERY TELEPHONE SUPPORT AND THE RIGHT TO RECEIVE UNSPECIFIED UPGRADES/ENHANCEMENTS OF MICROSOFT INTERNET EXPLORER ON A WHEN-AND-IF-AVAILABLE BASIS, IS BASED ON THE SALES PRICE OF THOSE ELEMENTS WHEN SOLD SEPARATELY

AND IS RECOGNIZED RATABLY ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THE RELATED PRODUCTS LIFE CYCLE. THE PERCENTAGE OF REVENUE RECORDED AS UNEARNED DUE TO UNDELIVERED ELEMENTS RANGES FROM APPROXIMATELY 15% TO 25% OF THE SALES PRICE FOR WINDOWS XP HOME,

APPROXIMATELY 5% TO 15% OF THE SALES PRICE FOR WINDOWS XP PROFESSIONAL, AND APPROXIMATELY 5% TO 15% OF THE SALES PRICE FOR DESKTOP APPLICATIONS, DEPENDING ON THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THE LICENSE AND PRICES OF THE ELEMENTS. PRODUCT LIFE CYCLES ARE

CURRENTLY ESTIMATED AT THREE AND A HALF YEARS FOR WINDOWS OPERATING SYSTEMS AND TWO YEARS FOR DESKTOP APPLICATIONS. UNEARNED REVENUE ALSO INCLUDES PAYMENTS FOR ONLINE ADVERTISING FOR WHICH THE ADVERTISEMENT HAS YET TO BE DISPLAYED AND PAYMENTS FOR

POST-DELIVERY SUPPORT SERVICES TO BE PERFORMED IN THE FUTURE.

ON SEPTEMBER 15, 2000, THE U.S. TAX COURT ISSUED AN ADVERSE RULING WITH RESPECT TO OUR CLAIM THAT THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE (IRS) INCORRECTLY ASSESSED TAXES

FOR 1990 AND 1991. ON DECEMBER 3, 2002, THE NINTH CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS SUBSTANTIALLY REVERSED THE U.S. TAX COURT DECISION. INCOME TAXES, EXCEPT FOR ONE ISSUE REMANDED TO THE U.S. TAX COURT BY THE NINTH CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS FOR ADDITIONAL

CONSIDERATION, HAVE BEEN SETTLED WITH THE IRS FOR ALL YEARS THROUGH 1996. THE IRS IS EXAMINING OUR 1997 THROUGH 1999 U.S. INCOME TAX RETURNS. MANAGEMENT BELIEVES ANY ADJUSTMENTS WHICH MAY BE REQUIRED WILL NOT BE MATERIAL TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

INCOME TAXES PAID WERE $1.3 BILLION IN 2001, $1.9 BILLION IN 2002, AND $2.8 BILLION IN 2003.

WE REPURCHASE OUR COMMON

SHARES PRIMARILY TO MANAGE THE DILUTIVE EFFECTS OF OUR STOCK OPTION AND STOCK PURCHASE PLANS, AND OTHER ISSUANCES OF COMMON SHARES. IN 2002, WE ACQUIRED 10.2 MILLION OF OUR SHARES AS A RESULT OF A STRUCTURED STOCK REPURCHASE TRANSACTION ENTERED INTO

IN 2001, WHICH GAVE US THE RIGHT TO ACQUIRE SUCH SHARES IN EXCHANGE FOR AN UP-FRONT NET PAYMENT OF $264 MILLION. TO ENHANCE OUR STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM, WE HAVE SOLD PUT WARRANTS TO INDEPENDENT THIRD PARTIES. THESE PUT WARRANTS ENTITLED THE HOLDERS

TO SELL SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK TO US ON CERTAIN DATES AT SPECIFIED PRICES. IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2001, WE ISSUED 5.6 MILLION SHARES TO SETTLE A PORTION OF THE OUTSTANDING PUT WARRANTS. AT JUNE 30, 2001, 2002, AND 2003 NO PUT WARRANTS

WERE OUTSTANDING. IN ANY PERIOD, CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES RELATED TO COMMON STOCK REPURCHASED MAY DIFFER FROM THE COMPARABLE CHANGE IN STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY, REFLECTING TIMING DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE RECOGNITION OF SHARE REPURCHASE

TRANSACTIONS AND THEIR SETTLEMENT FOR CASH.

ON JANUARY 16, 2003, OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS DECLARED AN ANNUAL DIVIDEND ON OUR COMMON STOCK OF $0.08 PER

WE FOLLOW ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES

BOARD OPINION 25 TO ACCOUNT FOR STOCK OPTION AND EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLANS. AN ALTERNATIVE METHOD OF ACCOUNTING FOR STOCK OPTIONS IS SFAS 123.

UNDER SFAS 123, EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTIONS ARE VALUED AT GRANT DATE USING THE BLACK-SCHOLES

VALUATION MODEL, AND THIS COMPENSATION COST IS RECOGNIZED RATABLY OVER THE VESTING PERIOD. IN ADDITION TO ANNOUNCING CHANGES TO OUR EMPLOYEE COMPENSATION ARRANGEMENTS IN JULY 2003, WE ALSO INDICATED THAT WE WILL ADOPT THE FAIR VALUE RECOGNITION

PROVISIONS OF SFAS 123 EFFECTIVE JULY 1, 2003 AND WILL REPORT THAT CHANGE IN ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLE USING THE RETROACTIVE RESTATEMENT METHOD DESCRIBED IN SFAS 148.

HAD COMPENSATION COST FOR OUR STOCK OPTION AND EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLANS BEEN DETERMINED AS PRESCRIBED BY SFAS 123, PRO FORMA INCOME STATEMENTS FOR 2001, 2002, AND 2003 WOULD HAVE BEEN AS FOLLOWS.

NOTE 18ACQUISITIONS

IN FISCAL YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2003, WE ACQUIRED ALL OF THE OUTSTANDING EQUITY INTERESTS OF NAVISION A/S, RARE LTD., AND PLACEWARE, INC. NAVISION,

HEADQUARTERED IN VEDBAEK, DENMARK, IS A PROVIDER OF INTEGRATED BUSINESS SOLUTIONS SOFTWARE FOR SMALL AND MID-SIZED BUSINESSES IN THE EUROPEAN MARKET AND WILL PLAY A KEY ROLE IN THE FUTURE DEVELOPMENT OF THE MICROSOFT BUSINESS SOLUTIONS SEGMENT. WE

ACQUIRED NAVISION ON JULY 12, 2002 FOR $1.465 BILLION CONSISTING PRIMARILY OF $662 MILLION IN CASH AND THE ISSUANCE OF 29.1 MILLION COMMON SHARES OF MICROSOFT STOCK VALUED AT $773 MILLION. THE VALUE OF THE COMMON SHARES ISSUED WAS DETERMINED BASED

ON THE AVERAGE MARKET PRICE OF OUR COMMON SHARES OVER THE 2-DAY PERIOD BEFORE AND AFTER TERMS OF THE ACQUISITION WERE AGREED TO AND APPROVED. RARE IS A VIDEO GAME DEVELOPER LOCATED OUTSIDE LEICESTERSHIRE, ENGLAND, THAT IS EXPECTED TO BROADEN THE

PORTFOLIO OF GAMES AVAILABLE FOR THE XBOX VIDEO GAME SYSTEM. RARE WAS ACQUIRED ON SEPTEMBER 24, 2002 FOR $377 MILLION CONSISTING PRIMARILY OF $375 MILLION IN CASH. PLACEWARE, LOCATED IN MOUNTAIN VIEW, CA, FACILITATES SECURE, HIGHLY RELIABLE,

CROSS-FIREWALL WEB CONFERENCING EXPERIENCES ALLOWING USERS TO CONDUCT BUSINESS MEETINGS ONLINE FROM A PC, AND WILL BECOME A PART OF MICROSOFTS REAL TIME COLLABORATION BUSINESS UNIT WITHIN THE INFORMATION WORKER SEGMENT. PLACEWARE WAS ACQUIRED

OF THE $75 MILLION OF ACQUIRED INTANGIBLE ASSETS IN THE RARE ACQUISITION, $13 MILLION WAS ASSIGNED TO RESEARCH AND

DEVELOPMENT ASSETS THAT WERE WRITTEN OFF IN ACCORDANCE WITH FIN 4. THOSE WRITE-OFFS ARE INCLUDED IN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES. THE REMAINING $62 MILLION OF ACQUIRED INTANGIBLE ASSETS HAVE A WEIGHTED AVERAGE USEFUL LIFE OF APPROXIMATELY FIVE

WEIGHTED AVERAGE USEFUL LIFE). THE $281 MILLION OF GOODWILL WAS ASSIGNED TO THE HOME AND ENTERTAINMENT SEGMENT. OF THAT TOTAL AMOUNT, APPROXIMATELY $270 MILLION IS EXPECTED TO BE DEDUCTIBLE FOR TAX PURPOSES.

THE $30 MILLION OF ACQUIRED INTANGIBLE ASSETS IN THE PLACEWARE ACQUISITION HAVE A WEIGHTED AVERAGE USEFUL LIFE OF APPROXIMATELY EIGHT YEARS. THE INTANGIBLE ASSETS

NOTE 19COMMITMENTS AND GUARANTEES

WE HAVE OPERATING LEASES FOR MOST U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL SALES AND SUPPORT OFFICES AND CERTAIN

EQUIPMENT. RENTAL EXPENSE FOR OPERATING LEASES WAS $281 MILLION, $318 MILLION, AND $290 MILLION IN 2001, 2002, AND 2003. FUTURE MINIMUM RENTAL COMMITMENTS UNDER NONCANCELLABLE LEASES, IN MILLIONS OF DOLLARS, ARE: 2004, $218; 2005, $202; 2006, $172;

2007, $134; 2008, $116; AND THEREAFTER, $429. WE HAVE COMMITTED $117 MILLION FOR CONSTRUCTING NEW BUILDINGS.

IN NOVEMBER 2002, THE FASB ISSUED

INTERPRETATION 45,

GUARANTORS ACCOUNTING AND DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS FOR GUARANTEES, INCLUDING INDIRECT GUARANTEES OF INDEBTEDNESS OF OTHERS

(FIN 45).

FIN 45 ELABORATES ON PREVIOUSLY EXISTING DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS FOR MOST

GUARANTEES, INCLUDING LOAN GUARANTEES SUCH AS STANDBY LETTERS OF CREDIT. IT ALSO CLARIFIES THAT AT THE TIME A COMPANY ISSUES A GUARANTEE, THE COMPANY MUST RECOGNIZE AN INITIAL LIABILITY FOR THE FAIR VALUE, OR MARKET VALUE, OF THE OBLIGATIONS IT

ASSUMES UNDER THE GUARANTEE AND MUST DISCLOSE THAT INFORMATION IN ITS INTERIM AND ANNUAL FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. THE PROVISIONS RELATED TO RECOGNIZING A LIABILITY AT INCEPTION OF THE GUARANTEE FOR THE FAIR VALUE OF THE GUARANTORS OBLIGATIONS

DOES NOT APPLY TO PRODUCT WARRANTIES OR TO GUARANTEES ACCOUNTED FOR AS DERIVATIVES. THE INITIAL RECOGNITION AND INITIAL MEASUREMENT PROVISIONS APPLY ON A PROSPECTIVE BASIS TO GUARANTEES ISSUED OR MODIFIED AFTER DECEMBER 31, 2002.

WE HAVE UNCONDITIONALLY GUARANTEED THE REPAYMENT OF CERTAIN JAPANESE YEN DENOMINATED BANK LOANS AND RELATED INTEREST AND FEES OF JUPITER TELECOMMUNICATION, LTD., A

JAPANESE CABLE COMPANY (JUPITER). THESE GUARANTEES AROSE ON FEBRUARY 1, 2003 IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE EXPIRATION OF PRIOR FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS, INCLUDING PREVIOUS GUARANTEES BY US. THE FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS WERE ENTERED INTO BY JUPITER AS PART OF

FINANCING ITS OPERATIONS. AS PART OF JUPITERS NEW FINANCING AGREEMENT, WE AGREED TO GUARANTEE REPAYMENT BY JUPITER OF THE LOANS OF APPROXIMATELY $51 MILLION. THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE AND THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE GUARANTEES WAS $10.5 MILLION

AND DID NOT RESULT IN A CHARGE TO OPERATIONS. THE GUARANTEES ARE IN EFFECT UNTIL THE EARLIER OF REPAYMENT OF THE LOANS, INCLUDING ACCRUED INTEREST AND FEES, OR FEBRUARY 1, 2009. THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT OF THE GUARANTEES IS LIMITED TO THE SUM OF THE TOTAL

DUE AND UNPAID PRINCIPAL AMOUNTS, ACCRUED AND UNPAID INTEREST, AND ANY OTHER RELATED EXPENSES. ADDITIONALLY, THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT OF THE GUARANTEES, DENOMINATED IN JAPANESE YEN, WILL VARY BASED ON FLUCTUATIONS IN FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES. IF WE WERE

REQUIRED TO MAKE PAYMENTS UNDER THE GUARANTEES, WE MAY RECOVER ALL OR A PORTION OF THOSE PAYMENTS UPON LIQUIDATION OF THE JUPITERS ASSETS. THE PROCEEDS FROM SUCH LIQUIDATION CANNOT BE ACCURATELY ESTIMATED DUE TO THE MULTITUDE OF FACTORS THAT

WOULD AFFECT THE VALUATION AND REALIZATION OF THE PROCEEDS IN THE EVENT OF LIQUIDATION.

IN CONNECTION WITH VARIOUS OPERATING LEASES, WE ISSUED

RESIDUAL VALUE GUARANTEES, WHICH PROVIDE THAT IF WE DO NOT PURCHASE THE LEASED PROPERTY FROM THE LESSOR AT THE END OF THE LEASE TERM, THEN WE ARE LIABLE TO THE LESSOR FOR AN AMOUNT EQUAL TO THE SHORTAGE (IF ANY) BETWEEN THE PROCEEDS FROM THE SALE OF

THE PROPERTY AND AN AGREED VALUE. AS OF JUNE 30, 2003, THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT OF THE RESIDUAL VALUE GUARANTEES WAS APPROXIMATELY $271 MILLION. WE BELIEVE THAT PROCEEDS FROM THE SALE OF PROPERTIES UNDER OPERATING LEASES WOULD EXCEED THE PAYMENT

OBLIGATION AND THEREFORE NO LIABILITY TO US CURRENTLY EXISTS.

WE PROVIDE INDEMNIFICATIONS OF VARYING SCOPE AND SIZE TO CERTAIN CUSTOMERS AGAINST

CLAIMS OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY INFRINGEMENT MADE BY THIRD PARTIES ARISING FROM THE USE OF OUR PRODUCTS. WE EVALUATE ESTIMATED LOSSES FOR SUCH INDEMNIFICATIONS UNDER SFAS 5,

ACCOUNTING FOR CONTINGENCIES

, AS INTERPRETED BY FIN 45. WE CONSIDER

SUCH FACTORS AS THE DEGREE OF PROBABILITY OF AN UNFAVORABLE OUTCOME AND THE ABILITY TO MAKE A REASONABLE ESTIMATE OF THE AMOUNT OF LOSS. TO DATE, WE HAVE NOT ENCOUNTERED MATERIAL COSTS AS A RESULT OF SUCH OBLIGATIONS AND HAVE NOT ACCRUED ANY

LIABILITIES RELATED TO SUCH INDEMNIFICATIONS IN OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

OUR PRODUCT WARRANTY ACCRUAL REFLECTS MANAGEMENTS BEST ESTIMATE OF

PROBABLE LIABILITY UNDER ITS PRODUCT WARRANTIES (PRIMARILY RELATING TO THE XBOX CONSOLE). WE DETERMINE THE WARRANTY ACCRUAL BASED ON KNOWN PRODUCT FAILURES (IF ANY), HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE, AND OTHER CURRENTLY AVAILABLE EVIDENCE. CHANGES IN THE

PRODUCT WARRANTY ACCRUAL FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2003 WERE AS FOLLOWS (IN MILLIONS).

OTHER THINGS, OUR BREAKUP INTO TWO COMPANIES. THE JUDGMENT WAS STAYED PENDING AN APPEAL. ON JUNE 28, 2001, THE U.S. COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA

CIRCUIT AFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART, AND VACATED THE JUDGMENT IN ITS ENTIRETY AND REMANDED THE CASE TO THE DISTRICT COURT FOR A NEW TRIAL ON ONE SECTION 1 CLAIM AND FOR ENTRY OF A NEW JUDGMENT CONSISTENT WITH ITS RULING. IN ITS RULING, THE

COURT OF APPEALS SUBSTANTIALLY NARROWED THE BASES OF LIABILITY FOUND BY THE DISTRICT COURT, BUT AFFIRMED SOME OF THE DISTRICT COURTS CONCLUSIONS THAT WE HAD VIOLATED SECTION 2. WE ENTERED INTO A SETTLEMENT WITH THE UNITED STATES ON NOVEMBER 2,

2001. NINE STATES (NEW YORK, OHIO, ILLINOIS, KENTUCKY, LOUISIANA, MARYLAND, MICHIGAN, NORTH CAROLINA AND WISCONSIN) AGREED TO SETTLE ON SUBSTANTIALLY THE SAME TERMS ON NOVEMBER 6, 2001. ON NOVEMBER 1, 2002, THE COURT APPROVED THE SETTLEMENT AS BEING

IN THE PUBLIC INTEREST, CONDITIONED UPON THE PARTIES AGREEMENT TO A MODIFICATION TO ONE PROVISION RELATED TO THE COURTS ONGOING JURISDICTION. NINE STATES AND THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA CONTINUED TO LITIGATE THE REMEDIES PHASE OF

NEW

YORK V. MICROSOFT

. THE NON-SETTLING STATES SOUGHT REMEDIES THAT WOULD HAVE IMPOSED MUCH BROADER RESTRICTIONS ON OUR BUSINESS THAN THE SETTLEMENT WITH THE DOJ AND NINE OTHER STATES. ON NOVEMBER 1, 2002, THE COURT ENTERED A FINAL JUDGMENT IN THIS

PART OF THE LITIGATION THAT LARGELY MIRRORED THE SETTLEMENT BETWEEN US, THE DOJ AND THE SETTLING STATES, WITH SOME MODIFICATIONS AND A DIFFERENT REGIME FOR ENFORCING COMPLIANCE. THE COURT DECLINED TO IMPOSE OTHER AND BROADER REMEDIES SOUGHT BY THE

NON-SETTLING STATES. TWO STATES, MASSACHUSETTS AND WEST VIRGINIA, APPEALED FROM THIS DECISION OF THE TRIAL COURT, AND WEST VIRGINIA DISMISSED ITS APPEAL AS PART OF A SETTLEMENT WITH US OF SEVERAL OTHER CASES.

THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION HAS INSTITUTED PROCEEDINGS IN WHICH IT ALLEGES THAT WE HAVE FAILED TO DISCLOSE INFORMATION THAT OUR COMPETITORS CLAIM THEY NEED TO

INTEROPERATE FULLY WITH WINDOWS 2000 CLIENTS AND SERVERS AND THAT WE HAVE ENGAGED IN DISCRIMINATORY LICENSING OF SUCH TECHNOLOGY, AS WELL AS IMPROPER BUNDLING OF MULTIMEDIA PLAYBACK TECHNOLOGY IN THE WINDOWS OPERATING SYSTEM. THE REMEDIES SOUGHT,

THOUGH NOT FULLY DEFINED, INCLUDE MANDATORY DISCLOSURE OF OUR WINDOWS OPERATING SYSTEM TECHNOLOGY, EITHER THE REMOVAL OF WINDOWS MEDIA TECHNOLOGY FROM WINDOWS OR A MUST CARRY OBLIGATION REQUIRING OEMS TO INSTALL COMPETITIVE MEDIA PLAYERS

WITH WINDOWS, AND IMPOSITION OF FINES IN AN AMOUNT THAT COULD BE AS LARGE AS 10% OF OUR WORLDWIDE ANNUAL REVENUE. WE DENY THE EUROPEAN COMMISSIONS ALLEGATIONS AND INTEND TO CONTEST THE PROCEEDINGS VIGOROUSLY. IN OTHER ONGOING INVESTIGATIONS,

VARIOUS FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS AND SEVERAL STATE ATTORNEYS GENERAL HAVE REQUESTED INFORMATION FROM US CONCERNING COMPETITION, PRIVACY, AND SECURITY ISSUES.

A LARGE NUMBER OF ANTITRUST AND UNFAIR COMPETITION CLASS ACTION LAWSUITS HAVE BEEN FILED AGAINST US IN VARIOUS STATE AND FEDERAL COURTS. THE FEDERAL CASES HAVE BEEN CONSOLIDATED IN THE U.S. DISTRICT COURT FOR MARYLAND. THESE CASES ALLEGE

THAT WE HAVE COMPETED UNFAIRLY AND UNLAWFULLY MONOPOLIZED ALLEGED MARKETS FOR OPERATING SYSTEMS AND CERTAIN SOFTWARE APPLICATIONS, AND THEY SEEK TO RECOVER ON BEHALF OF VARIOUSLY DEFINED CLASSES OF DIRECT AND INDIRECT PURCHASERS OVERCHARGES WE

ALLEGEDLY CHARGED FOR THESE PRODUCTS. TO DATE, COURTS HAVE DISMISSED ALL CLAIMS FOR DAMAGES AGAINST US BY INDIRECT PURCHASERS UNDER FEDERAL LAW AND IN 16 DIFFERENT STATES. NINE OF THOSE STATE COURT DECISIONS HAVE BEEN AFFIRMED ON APPEAL. CLAIMS ON

BEHALF OF FOREIGN PURCHASERS HAVE ALSO BEEN DISMISSED. APPEALS OF SEVERAL OF THESE RULINGS ARE STILL PENDING. NO TRIALS HAVE BEEN HELD CONCERNING ANY LIABILITY ISSUES. COURTS IN TEN STATES HAVE RULED THAT THESE CASES MAY PROCEED AS CLASS ACTIONS,

WHILE COURTS IN TWO STATES HAVE DENIED CLASS CERTIFICATION STATUS, AND ANOTHER COURT HAS RULED THAT NO CLASS ACTION IS AVAILABLE FOR ANTITRUST CLAIMS IN THAT STATE. THE FEDERAL DISTRICT COURT HAS CERTIFIED A CLASS OF DIRECT PURCHASERS OF OUR

OPERATING SYSTEM SOFTWARE THAT ACQUIRED THE SOFTWARE FROM THE SHOP.MICROSOFT.COM WEB SITE OR PURSUANT TO A DIRECT MARKETING CAMPAIGN AND OTHERWISE DENIED CERTIFICATION OF THE PROPOSED CLASSES. MEMBERS OF THE CERTIFIED CLASS LICENSED FEWER THAN

550,000 COPIES OF OPERATING SYSTEM SOFTWARE FROM MICROSOFT. IN 2003, WE REACHED AN AGREEMENT WITH COUNSEL FOR THE CALIFORNIA PLAINTIFFS TO SETTLE ALL CLAIMS IN 27 CONSOLIDATED CASES IN THAT STATE. UNDER THE PROPOSED SETTLEMENT, CLASS MEMBERS WILL BE

ABLE TO OBTAIN VOUCHERS WITH A TOTAL FACE VALUE OF UP TO $1.1 BILLION THAT MAY BE REDEEMED FOR CASH AGAINST PURCHASES OF A WIDE VARIETY OF PLATFORM-NEUTRAL COMPUTER HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE. TWO-THIRDS OF THE AMOUNT UNCLAIMED OR UNREDEEMED BY CLASS

MEMBERS THEN WILL BE MADE AVAILABLE TO CERTAIN SCHOOLS IN CALIFORNIA IN THE FORM OF VOUCHERS THAT ALSO MAY BE REDEEMED FOR CASH AGAINST PURCHASED OF A WIDE VARIETY OF PLATFORM-NEUTRAL COMPUTER HARDWARE, SOFTWARE AND RELATED SERVICES. THE COURT IN

CALIFORNIA PRELIMINARILY APPROVED THIS PROPOSED SETTLEMENT, BUT IT STILL REQUIRES FINAL APPROVAL BY THE COURT. IN 2003, WE ALSO REACHED SIMILAR AGREEMENTS TO SETTLE ALL CLAIMS IN MONTANA, FLORIDA, WEST VIRGINIA AND NORTH CAROLINA. THE TOTAL FACE

VALUE OF THE MONTANA SETTLEMENT IS $12.3 MILLION, THE FLORIDA SETTLEMENT, $202 MILLION, THE WEST VIRGINIA SETTLEMENT, $21 MILLION, AND THE NORTH CAROLINA SETTLEMENT, $89.2 MILLION. THESE PROPOSED SETTLEMENTS ARE STRUCTURED SIMILAR TO THE CALIFORNIA

SETTLEMENT, EXCEPT THAT, AMONG OTHER DIFFERENCES, ONE-HALF OF THE AMOUNTS UNCLAIMED BY CLASS MEMBERS WILL BE MADE AVAILABLE TO CERTAIN SCHOOLS IN MONTANA, FLORIDA, WEST VIRGINIA AND NORTH CAROLINA. THE PROPOSED SETTLEMENTS IN MONTANA, FLORIDA AND

WEST VIRGINIA HAVE BEEN PRELIMINARILY APPROVED BY THE COURTS IN THOSE STATES, BUT STILL REQUIRE FINAL APPROVAL. THE PARTIES HAVE FILED A MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY APPROVAL OF THE SETTLEMENT IN NORTH CAROLINA AND THE COURT HAS SCHEDULED A HEARING FOR

LATER THIS YEAR. WE INTEND TO CONTINUE VIGOROUSLY DEFENDING THE REMAINING LAWSUITS. WE ESTIMATE THE TOTAL COST TO RESOLVE ALL OF THESE CASES WILL RANGE BETWEEN $916 MILLION AND $1.1 BILLION WITH THE ACTUAL COST DEPENDENT UPON MANY UNKNOWN

FACTORS SUCH AS THE QUANTITY AND MIX OF PRODUCTS FOR WHICH CLAIMS WILL BE MADE, THE NUMBER OF ELIGIBLE CLASS MEMBERS WHO ULTIMATELY USE THE VOUCHERS, THE NATURE OF HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE THAT IS ACQUIRED USING THE VOUCHERS, AND THE COST OF

ADMINISTERING THE CLAIMS PROCESS. IN ACCORDANCE WITH SFAS 5 AND FIN 14,

NETSCAPE COMMUNICATIONS INC., A SUBSIDIARY OF AOL-TIME WARNER INC., FILED SUIT AGAINST US ON JANUARY 22, 2002 IN U.S. DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA,

WITH THE ANTITRUST AND UNFAIR COMPETITION CLASS ACTIONS DESCRIBED ABOVE. ON MAY 29, 2003, WE AND AOL TIME WARNER ANNOUNCED AN AGREEMENT TO SETTLE THE CASE. AS PART OF THE SETTLEMENT, WE PAID $750 MILLION TO AOL TIME WARNER AND PROVIDED AOL TIME

WARNER A ROYALTY-FREE, SEVEN-YEAR LICENSE TO USE MICROSOFT INTERNET EXPLORER TECHNOLOGIES WITH THE AOL CLIENT. THE PARTIES AGREED ON VARIOUS OTHER TECHNICAL PROVISIONS AND ENTERED INTO A SEPARATE AGREEMENT TO COLLABORATE ON LONG-TERM DIGITAL MEDIA

POLICIES, AND BUSINESS PRACTICES INTERFERED WITH BES RELATIONSHIPS WITH COMPUTER MANUFACTURERS AND DISCOURAGED THEM FROM ADOPTING BES OWN OPERATING SYSTEM

FOR THEIR PRODUCTS. WE BELIEVE THE TOTAL COST TO RESOLVE THIS CASE WILL NOT BE MATERIAL TO OUR FINANCIAL POSITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

ON MARCH

8, 2002, SUN MICROSYSTEMS, INC. FILED SUIT AGAINST US ALLEGING VIOLATIONS OF FEDERAL AND STATE ANTITRUST AND UNFAIR COMPETITION LAWS AS WELL AS CLAIMS UNDER THE FEDERAL COPYRIGHT ACT. SUN SEEKS INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND UNSPECIFIED TREBLE DAMAGES ALONG

WITH ITS FEES AND COSTS. WE DENY THESE ALLEGATIONS AND WILL VIGOROUSLY DEFEND THIS ACTION. THE CASE HAS BEEN TRANSFERRED FOR PRETRIAL PURPOSES TO THE U.S. DISTRICT COURT IN BALTIMORE, MARYLAND AND IS BEING COORDINATED WITH THE ANTITRUST AND UNFAIR

COMPETITION CLASS ACTIONS DESCRIBED ABOVE. ON JANUARY 21, 2003, THE COURT GRANTED SUNS MOTION FOR A PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION AND ENTERED AN INJUNCTION REQUIRING US TO DISTRIBUTE CERTAIN SUN JAVA SOFTWARE WITH MICROSOFT WINDOWS XP AND CERTAIN

OTHER PRODUCTS. THE INJUNCTION ALSO PROHIBITS US FROM DISTRIBUTING OUR VERSION OF JAVA SOFTWARE IN A VARIETY OF WAYS. THE U.S. COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE FOURTH CIRCUIT GRANTED OUR REQUEST FOR A STAY OF THE PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION ORDER. ON JUNE 26,

2003, A THREE JUDGE PANEL OF THE FOURTH CIRCUIT ISSUED A UNANIMOUS OPINION VACATING THE PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION REQUIRING US TO DISTRIBUTE SUN JAVA SOFTWARE AND UPHELD THE PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION PROHIBITING US FROM DISTRIBUTING OUR VERSION OF JAVA

SOFTWARE IN CERTAIN WAYS.

WE ARE THE DEFENDANT IN MORE THAN 30 PATENT INFRINGEMENT CASES. SEVERAL OF THESE CASES ARE APPROACHING TRIAL. IN THE CASE

OF

EOLAS TECHNOLOGIES, INC. AND UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA V. MICROSOFT

, FILED IN THE U.S. DISTRICT COURT FOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF ILLINOIS ON FEBRUARY 2, 1999, THE PLAINTIFFS ACCUSED THE BROWSER FUNCTIONALITY OF WINDOWS OF INFRINGEMENT. ON

AUGUST 11, 2003, THE JURY AWARDED THE PLAINTIFFS APPROXIMATELY $520 MILLION IN DAMAGES FOR INFRINGEMENT FROM THE DATE THE PLAINTIFFS PATENT ISSUED THROUGH SEPTEMBER 2001. THE PLAINTIFFS ARE SEEKING AN EQUITABLE ACCOUNTING FOR DAMAGES FROM

SEPTEMBER 2001 TO THE PRESENT. WE WILL APPEAL THE JURY AWARD AND ANY AWARD ON THE EQUITABLE ACCOUNTING ISSUE UPON CONCLUSION OF THOSE ASPECTS OF THE CASE THAT REMAIN TO BE COMPLETED BEFORE THE TRIAL COURT. WHILE IT IS NOT CURRENTLY POSSIBLE TO

ESTIMATE THE RANGE OF POSSIBLE LOSS, WE BELIEVE THE TOTAL COST TO RESOLVE THIS CASE WILL NOT BE MATERIAL TO OUR FINANCIAL POSITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. HOWEVER, THE ACTUAL COSTS ARE DEPENDENT UPON MANY UNKNOWN FACTORS SUCH AS THE OUTCOME OF

ISSUES REMAINING TO BE DECIDED BY THE TRIAL COURT, SUCCESS ON APPEAL, AND THE EVENTS OF A RETRIAL OF THE CASE SHOULD THE CASE BE REMANDED TO TRIAL FOLLOWING APPEAL. THE TRIAL OF

INTERTRUST V. MICROSOFT

, FILED IN THE U.S. DISTRICT COURT FOR

NORTHERN CALIFORNIA ON APRIL 26, 2001, IS ANTICIPATED IN 2005. THE PLAINTIFF IN THIS CASE HAS ACCUSED A LARGE NUMBER OF PRODUCTS, INCLUDING WINDOWS AND OFFICE, OF INFRINGEMENT. IN EACH OF

EOLAS

AND

INTERTRUST

, INJUNCTIVE RELIEF ALSO

MAY BE AWARDED THAT COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT DISTRIBUTION OF WINDOWS OR OFFICE. ADVERSE OUTCOMES IN SOME OR ALL OF THE PENDING CASES MAY RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT MONETARY DAMAGES OR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AGAINST US.

WE ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO A VARIETY OF OTHER CLAIMS AND SUITS THAT ARISE FROM TIME TO TIME IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF OUR BUSINESS.

WHILE MANAGEMENT CURRENTLY BELIEVES THAT RESOLVING ALL OF THESE MATTERS, INDIVIDUALLY OR IN AGGREGATE, WILL NOT HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR FINANCIAL

POSITION OR OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, THE LITIGATION AND OTHER CLAIMS NOTED ABOVE ARE SUBJECT TO INHERENT UNCERTAINTIES AND MANAGEMENTS VIEW OF THESE MATTERS MAY CHANGE IN THE FUTURE. WERE AN UNFAVORABLE FINAL OUTCOME TO OCCUR, THERE EXISTS

THE POSSIBILITY OF A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR FINANCIAL POSITION AND THE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE PERIOD IN WHICH THE EFFECT BECOMES REASONABLY ESTIMABLE.

SEGMENT INFORMATION IS PRESENTED IN ACCORDANCE

WITH SFAS 131,

DISCLOSURES ABOUT SEGMENTS OF AN ENTERPRISE AND RELATED INFORMATION.

THIS STANDARD IS BASED ON A MANAGEMENT APPROACH, WHICH REQUIRES SEGMENTATION BASED UPON OUR INTERNAL ORGANIZATION AND REPORTING OF REVENUE AND OPERATING

INCOME BASED UPON INTERNAL ACCOUNTING METHODS. OUR FINANCIAL REPORTING SYSTEMS PRESENT VARIOUS DATA FOR MANAGEMENT TO RUN THE BUSINESS, INCLUDING INTERNAL PROFIT AND LOSS STATEMENTS (P&LS) PREPARED ON A BASIS NOT CONSISTENT WITH U.S. GAAP.

ASSETS ARE NOT ALLOCATED TO SEGMENTS FOR INTERNAL REPORTING PRESENTATIONS. A PORTION OF AMORTIZATION AND DEPRECIATION IS INCLUDED WITH VARIOUS OTHER COSTS IN AN OVERHEAD ALLOCATION TO EACH SEGMENT AND IT IS

37  /  MSFT

2003 FORM 10-K

TABLE OF CONTENTS

PART II, ITEM 8

IMPRACTICABLE FOR THE COMPANY TO SEPARATELY IDENTIFY THE AMOUNT OF AMORTIZATION AND DEPRECIATION BY SEGMENT THAT IS INCLUDED IN THE MEASURE OF SEGMENT PROFIT OR LOSS.

ON JULY 1, 2002, WE REVISED OUR SEGMENTS. THESE CHANGES ARE DESIGNED TO PROMOTE BETTER ALIGNMENT OF STRATEGIES AND OBJECTIVES BETWEEN DEVELOPMENT,

SALES, MARKETING, AND SERVICES ORGANIZATIONS; PROVIDE FOR MORE TIMELY AND RATIONAL ALLOCATION OF DEVELOPMENT, SALES, AND MARKETING RESOURCES WITHIN BUSINESSES; AND FOCUS LONG-TERM PLANNING EFFORTS ON KEY OBJECTIVES AND INITIATIVES. OUR SEVEN NEW

SEGMENTS ARE: CLIENT; SERVER AND TOOLS; INFORMATION WORKER; MICROSOFT BUSINESS SOLUTIONS; MSN; MOBILE AND EMBEDDED DEVICES; AND HOME AND ENTERTAINMENT. PRIOR YEAR SEGMENT INFORMATION HAS BEEN RESTATED TO CONFORM TO THE SEVEN NEW SEGMENTS. IT IS NOT

PRACTICAL TO DISCERN OPERATING INCOME FOR 2001 FOR THE CURRENT SEGMENTS OR OPERATING INCOME FOR 2003 FOR THE PREVIOUS SEGMENTS DUE TO REORGANIZATIONS.

THE SEGMENTS ARE DESIGNED TO ALLOCATE RESOURCES INTERNALLY AND PROVIDE A FRAMEWORK TO DETERMINE MANAGEMENT RESPONSIBILITY. DUE TO OUR INTEGRATED BUSINESS STRUCTURE, OPERATING COSTS INCLUDED IN ONE SEGMENT MAY BENEFIT OTHER SEGMENTS, AND

THEREFORE THESE SEGMENTS ARE NOT DESIGNED TO MEASURE OPERATING INCOME OR LOSS DIRECTLY RELATED TO THE PRODUCTS INCLUDED IN EACH SEGMENT. INTER-SEGMENT COST COMMISSIONS ARE ESTIMATED BY MANAGEMENT AND USED TO COMPENSATE OR CHARGE EACH SEGMENT FOR

SUCH SHARED COSTS AND TO INCENT SHARED EFFORTS. MANAGEMENT WILL CONTINUALLY EVALUATE THE ALIGNMENT OF DEVELOPMENT, SALES ORGANIZATIONS, AND INTER-SEGMENT COMMISSIONS FOR SEGMENT REPORTING PURPOSES, WHICH MAY RESULT IN CHANGES TO SEGMENT ALLOCATIONS

IN FUTURE PERIODS.

THE CLIENT SEGMENT INCLUDES REVENUE AND OPERATING EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH WINDOWS XP, WINDOWS 2000, AND OTHER STANDARD WINDOWS

OPERATING SYSTEMS. SERVER AND TOOLS SEGMENT CONSISTS OF REVENUE AND OPERATING EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH SERVER SOFTWARE LICENSES AND CLIENT ACCESS LICENSES (CALS) FOR WINDOWS SERVER, SQL SERVER, EXCHANGE SERVER, AND OTHER SERVERS. IT ALSO INCLUDES

DEVELOPER TOOLS, TRAINING, CERTIFICATION, MICROSOFT PRESS, PREMIER PRODUCT SUPPORT SERVICES, AND MICROSOFT CONSULTING SERVICES. INFORMATION WORKER SEGMENT INCLUDES MICROSOFT OFFICE, MICROSOFT PROJECT, VISIO, OTHER INFORMATION WORKER PRODUCTS,

SHAREPOINT PORTAL SERVER CALS, AN ALLOCATION FOR CALS, AND PROFESSIONAL PRODUCT SUPPORT SERVICES. MICROSOFT BUSINESS SOLUTIONS INCLUDES MICROSOFT GREAT PLAINS, NAVISION, AND BCENTRAL. MSN INCLUDES MSN SUBSCRIPTION AND MSN NETWORK SERVICES. MOBILE

AND EMBEDDED DEVICES INCLUDES WINDOWS MOBILE SOFTWARE, WINDOWS EMBEDDED DEVICE OPERATING SYSTEMS, MAPPOINT, AND WINDOWS AUTOMOTIVE. HOME AND ENTERTAINMENT INCLUDES THE XBOX VIDEO GAME SYSTEM, PC GAMES, CONSUMER SOFTWARE AND HARDWARE, AND TV

PLATFORM.

RECONCILING AMOUNTS INCLUDE ADJUSTMENTS TO STATE REVENUE AND OPERATING INCOME IN ACCORDANCE WITH U.S. GAAP AND CORPORATE LEVEL EXPENSES NOT

SPECIFICALLY ATTRIBUTED TO A SEGMENT. FOR REVENUE, RECONCILING ITEMS INCLUDE CERTAIN UNDELIVERED ELEMENTS OF UNEARNED REVENUE AND ALLOWANCES FOR CERTAIN SALES RETURNS AND REBATES. RECONCILING ITEMS FOR OPERATING INCOME/(LOSS) INCLUDE GENERAL AND

ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES ($1.55 BILLION IN 2002 AND $2.10 BILLION IN 2003), BROAD-BASED RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES ($202 MILLION IN 2002 AND $210 MILLION IN 2003), AND CERTAIN CORPORATE LEVEL SALES AND MARKETING COSTS ($526 MILLION IN 2002 AND

$688 MILLION IN 2003). THE INTERNAL SEGMENT OPERATING INCOME OR LOSS ALSO INCLUDES NON-GAAP ACCELERATED METHODS OF DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION. ADDITIONALLY, LOSSES ON EQUITY INVESTEES AND MINORITY INTEREST ARE CLASSIFIED IN OPERATING INCOME FOR

INTERNAL REPORTING PRESENTATIONS.

REVENUE ATTRIBUTABLE TO U.S. OPERATIONS INCLUDES SHIPMENTS TO CUSTOMERS IN THE UNITED STATES, LICENSING TO OEMS AND

CERTAIN MULTINATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS, AND EXPORTS OF FINISHED GOODS, PRIMARILY TO ASIA, LATIN AMERICA, AND CANADA. REVENUE FROM U.S. OPERATIONS TOTALED $17.8 BILLION, $20.9 BILLION, AND $22.1 BILLION IN 2001, 2002, AND 2003. REVENUE FROM OUTSIDE THE

UNITED STATES, EXCLUDING LICENSING TO OEMS AND CERTAIN MULTINATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS AND U.S. EXPORTS, TOTALED $7.5 BILLION, $7.5 BILLION, AND $10.1 BILLION IN 2001, 2002, AND 2003. NO SINGLE CUSTOMER ACCOUNTED FOR 10% OR MORE OF REVENUE IN 2001,

2002, OR 2003.

LONG-LIVED ASSETS (PRINCIPALLY PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT) TOTALED $2.0 BILLION AND $1.9 BILLION IN THE UNITED STATES IN 2002 AND 2003 AND

$220 MILLION, AND $294 MILLION IN OTHER COUNTRIES IN 2002 AND 2003.
