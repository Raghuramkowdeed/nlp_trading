GENERAL

OUR VISION

MICROSOFT IS A TECHNOLOGY COMPANY WHOSE MISSION IS TO EMPOWER EVERY PERSON AND EVERY ORGANIZATION ON THE PLANET TO ACHIEVE MORE. OUR STRATEGY IS TO BUILD BEST-IN-CLASS PLATFORMS AND PRODUCTIVITY SERVICES FOR A

MOBILE-FIRST, CLOUD-FIRST WORLD.

THE MOBILE-FIRST, CLOUD-FIRST WORLD IS TRANSFORMING THE WAY INDIVIDUALS AND ORGANIZATIONS USE AND

INTERACT WITH TECHNOLOGY. OUR WORLDVIEW FOR MOBILE-FIRST IS NOT ABOUT THE MOBILITY OF DEVICES; IT IS CENTERED ON THE MOBILITY OF EXPERIENCES THAT, IN TURN, ARE ORCHESTRATED BY THE CLOUD. CLOUD COMPUTING AND STORAGE SOLUTIONS PROVIDE USERS AND

ENTERPRISES WITH VARIOUS CAPABILITIES TO STORE AND PROCESS THEIR DATA IN THIRD-PARTY DATA CENTERS. MOBILITY ENCOMPASSES THE RICH COLLECTION OF DATA, APPLICATIONS, AND SERVICES THAT ACCOMPANY OUR CUSTOMERS AS THEY MOVE FROM SETTING TO SETTING IN

THEIR LIVES. WE ARE TRANSFORMING OUR BUSINESSES TO ENABLE MICROSOFT TO LEAD THE DIRECTION OF THIS TRANSFORMATION, AND ENABLE OUR CUSTOMERS AND PARTNERS TO THRIVE IN THIS EVOLVING WORLD.

WHAT WE OFFER

FOUNDED IN 1975, WE OPERATE WORLDWIDE AND HAVE OFFICES IN MORE THAN 100

COUNTRIES. WE DEVELOP, LICENSE, AND SUPPORT A WIDE RANGE OF SOFTWARE PRODUCTS, SERVICES, AND DEVICES THAT DELIVER NEW OPPORTUNITIES, GREATER CONVENIENCE, AND ENHANCED VALUE TO PEOPLES LIVES. WE OFFER AN ARRAY OF SERVICES, INCLUDING CLOUD-BASED

SERVICES, TO CONSUMERS AND BUSINESSES. WE DESIGN, MANUFACTURE, AND SELL DEVICES THAT INTEGRATE WITH OUR CLOUD-BASED SERVICES, AND WE DELIVER RELEVANT ONLINE ADVERTISING TO A GLOBAL AUDIENCE.

OUR PRODUCTS INCLUDE OPERATING SYSTEMS FOR COMPUTING DEVICES, SERVERS, PHONES, AND OTHER INTELLIGENT DEVICES; SERVER APPLICATIONS FOR DISTRIBUTED

COMPUTING ENVIRONMENTS; CROSS-DEVICE PRODUCTIVITY APPLICATIONS; BUSINESS SOLUTION APPLICATIONS; DESKTOP AND SERVER MANAGEMENT TOOLS; SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT TOOLS; VIDEO GAMES; AND ONLINE ADVERTISING. WE ALSO DESIGN AND SELL HARDWARE INCLUDING PCS,

TABLETS, GAMING AND ENTERTAINMENT CONSOLES, PHONES, OTHER INTELLIGENT DEVICES, AND RELATED ACCESSORIES. WE OFFER CLOUD-BASED SOLUTIONS THAT PROVIDE CUSTOMERS WITH SOFTWARE, SERVICES, PLATFORMS, AND CONTENT. WE ALSO PROVIDE CONSULTING AND PRODUCT AND

SOLUTION SUPPORT SERVICES, AND WE TRAIN AND CERTIFY COMPUTER SYSTEM INTEGRATORS AND DEVELOPERS.

THE AMBITIONS THAT DRIVE US

TO CARRY OUT OUR STRATEGY, OUR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS FOCUS ON THREE INTERCONNECTED AMBITIONS.



REINVENT PRODUCTIVITY AND BUSINESS PROCESSES.



BUILD THE INTELLIGENT CLOUD PLATFORM.



CREATE MORE PERSONAL COMPUTING.

REINVENT PRODUCTIVITY AND BUSINESS PROCESSES

WE BELIEVE WE CAN SIGNIFICANTLY ENHANCE THE LIVES OF OUR CUSTOMERS USING OUR BROAD PORTFOLIO OF COMMUNICATION, PRODUCTIVITY, AND INFORMATION

SERVICES THAT SPANS DEVICES AND PLATFORMS. PRODUCTIVITY WILL BE THE FIRST AND FOREMOST OBJECTIVE, TO ENABLE PEOPLE TO MEET AND COLLABORATE MORE EASILY, AND TO EFFECTIVELY EXPRESS IDEAS IN NEW WAYS. WE WILL DESIGN APPLICATIONS AS DUAL-USE WITH THE

INTELLIGENCE TO PARTITION DATA BETWEEN WORK AND LIFE WHILE RESPECTING EACH PERSONS PRIVACY CHOICES. THE FOUNDATION FOR THESE EFFORTS WILL REST ON ADVANCING OUR LEADING PRODUCTIVITY, COLLABORATION, AND BUSINESS PROCESS TOOLS INCLUDING SKYPE,

ONEDRIVE, ONENOTE, OUTLOOK, WORD, EXCEL, POWERPOINT, BING, AND DYNAMICS. WITH OFFICE 365, WE PROVIDE THESE FAMILIAR INDUSTRY-LEADING PRODUCTIVITY AND BUSINESS PROCESS TOOLS AS CLOUD SERVICES, ENABLING ACCESS FROM ANYWHERE AND ANY DEVICE. THIS

CREATES AN OPPORTUNITY TO REACH NEW CUSTOMERS, AND EXPAND THE USAGE OF OUR SERVICES BY OUR EXISTING CUSTOMERS.

WE SEE OPPORTUNITY IN

COMBINING OUR OFFERINGS IN NEW WAYS THAT ARE MORE CONTEXTUAL AND PERSONAL, WHILE ENSURING PEOPLE, RATHER THAN THEIR DEVICES, REMAIN AT THE CENTER OF THE DIGITAL EXPERIENCE. WE WILL OFFER OUR SERVICES ACROSS ECOSYSTEMS AND DEVICES OUTSIDE OUR OWN. AS

PEOPLE MOVE FROM DEVICE TO DEVICE, SO WILL THEIR CONTENT AND THE RICHNESS OF THEIR SERVICES. WE ARE ENGINEERING OUR APPLICATIONS SO USERS CAN FIND, TRY, AND BUY THEM IN FRICTION-FREE WAYS.

BUILD THE INTELLIGENT CLOUD PLATFORM

IN DEPLOYING TECHNOLOGY THAT ADVANCES BUSINESS STRATEGY,

ENTERPRISES DECIDE WHAT SOLUTIONS WILL MAKE EMPLOYEES MORE PRODUCTIVE, COLLABORATIVE, AND SATISFIED, AND CONNECT WITH CUSTOMERS IN NEW AND COMPELLING WAYS. THEY WORK TO UNLOCK BUSINESS INSIGHTS FROM A WORLD OF DATA. TO ACHIEVE THESE OBJECTIVES,

INCREASINGLY BUSINESSES LOOK TO LEVERAGE THE BENEFITS OF THE CLOUD. HELPING BUSINESSES MOVE TO THE CLOUD IS ONE OF OUR LARGEST OPPORTUNITIES, AND WE BELIEVE WE WORK FROM A POSITION OF STRENGTH.

THE SHIFT TO THE CLOUD IS DRIVEN BY THREE IMPORTANT ECONOMIES OF SCALE: LARGER DATACENTERS CAN DEPLOY COMPUTATIONAL RESOURCES AT SIGNIFICANTLY

LOWER COST PER UNIT THAN SMALLER ONES; LARGER DATACENTERS CAN COORDINATE AND AGGREGATE DIVERSE CUSTOMER, GEOGRAPHIC, AND APPLICATION DEMAND PATTERNS, IMPROVING THE UTILIZATION OF COMPUTING, STORAGE, AND NETWORK RESOURCES; AND MULTI-TENANCY LOWERS

APPLICATION MAINTENANCE LABOR COSTS FOR LARGE PUBLIC CLOUDS. AS ONE OF THE LARGEST PROVIDERS OF CLOUD COMPUTING AT SCALE, WE ARE WELL-POSITIONED TO HELP BUSINESSES MOVE TO THE CLOUD SO THAT BUSINESSES CAN FOCUS ON INNOVATION WHILE LEAVING

NON-DIFFERENTIATING ACTIVITIES TO RELIABLE AND COST-EFFECTIVE PROVIDERS LIKE MICROSOFT.

WITH AZURE, WE ARE ONE OF VERY FEW CLOUD

VENDORS THAT RUN AT A SCALE THAT MEETS THE NEEDS OF BUSINESSES OF ALL SIZES AND COMPLEXITIES. WE BELIEVE THE COMBINATION OF AZURE AND WINDOWS SERVER MAKES US THE ONLY COMPANY WITH A PUBLIC, PRIVATE, AND HYBRID CLOUD PLATFORM THAT CAN POWER MODERN

BUSINESS. WE ARE WORKING TO ENHANCE THE RETURN ON INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY (IT) INVESTMENT BY ENABLING ENTERPRISES TO COMBINE THEIR EXISTING DATACENTERS AND OUR PUBLIC CLOUD INTO A SINGLE COHESIVE INFRASTRUCTURE. BUSINESSES CAN DEPLOY

APPLICATIONS IN THEIR OWN DATACENTER, A PARTNERS DATACENTER, OR IN OUR DATACENTERS WITH COMMON SECURITY, MANAGEMENT, AND ADMINISTRATION ACROSS ALL ENVIRONMENTS, WITH THE FLEXIBILITY AND SCALE THEY WANT.

WE ENABLE ORGANIZATIONS TO SECURELY ADOPT SOFTWARE-AS-A-SERVICE APPLICATIONS (BOTH OUR OWN AND THIRD-PARTY) AND INTEGRATE THEM WITH THEIR EXISTING

SECURITY AND MANAGEMENT INFRASTRUCTURE. WE WILL CONTINUE TO INNOVATE WITH HIGHER-LEVEL SERVICES INCLUDING IDENTITY AND DIRECTORY SERVICES THAT MANAGE EMPLOYEE CORPORATE IDENTITY AND MANAGE AND SECURE CORPORATE INFORMATION ACCESSED AND STORED ACROSS

A GROWING NUMBER OF DEVICES, RICH DATA STORAGE AND ANALYTICS SERVICES, MACHINE LEARNING SERVICES, MEDIA SERVICES, WEB AND MOBILE BACKEND SERVICES, AND DEVELOPER

PRODUCTIVITY SERVICES. TO FOSTER A RICH DEVELOPER ECOSYSTEM, OUR DIGITAL WORK AND LIFE EXPERIENCES WILL ALSO BE EXTENSIBLE, ENABLING CUSTOMERS AND PARTNERS TO FURTHER CUSTOMIZE AND ENHANCE OUR

SOLUTIONS, ACHIEVING EVEN MORE VALUE. THIS STRATEGY REQUIRES CONTINUING INVESTMENT IN DATACENTERS AND OTHER INFRASTRUCTURE TO SUPPORT OUR DEVICES AND SERVICES.

CREATE MORE PERSONAL COMPUTING

WINDOWS 10 IS THE CORNERSTONE OF OUR AMBITION TO USHER IN

AN ERA OF MORE PERSONAL COMPUTING. WE SEE THE LAUNCH OF WINDOWS 10 IN JULY 2015 AS A CRITICAL, TRANSFORMATIVE MOMENT FOR THE COMPANY BECAUSE WE WILL MOVE FROM AN OPERATING SYSTEM THAT RUNS ON A PC TO A SERVICE THAT CAN POWER THE FULL SPECTRUM OF

DEVICES IN OUR CUSTOMERS LIVES. WE DEVELOPED WINDOWS 10 NOT ONLY TO BE FAMILIAR TO OUR USERS, BUT MORE SAFE AND SECURE, AND ALWAYS UP-TO-DATE. WE BELIEVE WINDOWS 10 IS MORE PERSONAL AND PRODUCTIVE, WORKING SEAMLESSLY WITH FUNCTIONALITY SUCH AS

CORTANA, OFFICE, CONTINUUM, AND UNIVERSAL APPLICATIONS. WE DESIGNED WINDOWS 10 TO FOSTER INNOVATION  FROM US, OUR PARTNERS AND DEVELOPERS  THROUGH EXPERIENCES SUCH AS OUR NEW BROWSER MICROSOFT EDGE, ACROSS THE RANGE OF EXISTING DEVICES,

AND INTO ENTIRELY NEW DEVICE CATEGORIES.

OUR AMBITION FOR WINDOWS 10 IS TO BROADEN OUR ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY THROUGH THREE KEY LEVERS.

AN ORIGINAL EQUIPMENT MANUFACTURER (OEM) ECOSYSTEM THAT CREATES EXCITING NEW HARDWARE DESIGNS FOR WINDOWS 10; OUR OWN COMMITMENT TO THE HEALTH AND PROFITABILITY OF OUR FIRST-PARTY PREMIUM DEVICE PORTFOLIO; AND MONETIZATION OPPORTUNITIES

SUCH AS SERVICES, SUBSCRIPTIONS, GAMING, AND SEARCH. OUR OEM PARTNERS ARE INVESTING IN AN EXTENSIVE PORTFOLIO OF HARDWARE DESIGNS AND CONFIGURATIONS AS THEY READY FOR WINDOWS 10. BY DECEMBER 2015, WE ANTICIPATE THE WIDEST RANGE OF WINDOWS HARDWARE

EVER TO BE AVAILABLE.

WITH THE LAUNCH OF WINDOWS 10, WE ARE REALIZING OUR VISION OF A SINGLE, UNIFIED WINDOWS OPERATING SYSTEM ON WHICH

DEVELOPERS AND OEMS CAN CONTRIBUTE TO A THRIVING WINDOWS ECOSYSTEM. WE INVEST HEAVILY TO MAKE WINDOWS THE MOST SECURE, MANAGEABLE, AND CAPABLE OPERATING SYSTEM FOR THE NEEDS OF A MODERN WORKFORCE. WE ARE WORKING TO CREATE A BROAD DEVELOPER

OPPORTUNITY BY UNIFYING THE INSTALLED BASE TO WINDOWS 10 THROUGH UPGRADES AND ONGOING UPDATES, AND BY ENABLING UNIVERSAL WINDOWS APPLICATIONS TO RUN ACROSS ALL DEVICE TARGETS. AS PART OF OUR STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES, WE ARE COMMITTED TO DESIGNING AND

MARKETING FIRST-PARTY DEVICES TO HELP DRIVE INNOVATION, CREATE NEW CATEGORIES, AND STIMULATE DEMAND IN THE WINDOWS ECOSYSTEM, INCLUDING ACROSS PCS, PHONES, TABLETS, CONSOLES, WEARABLES, LARGE MULTI-TOUCH DISPLAYS, AND NEW CATEGORIES SUCH AS THE

HOLOLENS HOLOGRAPHIC COMPUTING PLATFORM. WE ARE DEVELOPING NEW INPUT/OUTPUT METHODS LIKE SPEECH, PEN, GESTURE, AND AUGMENTED REALITY HOLOGRAMS TO POWER MORE PERSONAL COMPUTING EXPERIENCES WITH WINDOWS 10.

OUR FUTURE OPPORTUNITY

THERE ARE SEVERAL

DISTINCT AREAS OF TECHNOLOGY THAT WE AIM TO DRIVE FORWARD. OUR GOAL IS TO LEAD THE INDUSTRY IN THESE AREAS OVER THE LONG-TERM, WHICH WE EXPECT WILL TRANSLATE TO SUSTAINED GROWTH. WE ARE INVESTING SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES IN.



DELIVERING NEW PRODUCTIVITY, ENTERTAINMENT, AND BUSINESS PROCESSES TO IMPROVE HOW PEOPLE COMMUNICATE, COLLABORATE, LEARN, WORK, PLAY, AND INTERACT WITH ONE

ANOTHER.



ESTABLISHING THE WINDOWS PLATFORM ACROSS THE PC, TABLET, PHONE, SERVER, OTHER DEVICES, AND THE CLOUD TO DRIVE A THRIVING ECOSYSTEM OF DEVELOPERS, UNIFY THE

CROSS-DEVICE USER EXPERIENCE, AND INCREASE AGILITY WHEN BRINGING NEW ADVANCES TO MARKET.



BUILDING AND RUNNING CLOUD-BASED SERVICES IN WAYS THAT UNLEASH NEW EXPERIENCES AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR BUSINESSES AND INDIVIDUALS.



DEVELOPING NEW DEVICES THAT HAVE INCREASINGLY NATURAL WAYS TO INTERACT WITH THEM, INCLUDING SPEECH, PEN, GESTURE, AND AUGMENTED REALITY HOLOGRAMS.



APPLYING MACHINE LEARNING TO MAKE TECHNOLOGY MORE INTUITIVE AND ABLE TO ACT ON OUR BEHALF, INSTEAD OF AT OUR COMMAND.

WE BELIEVE THE BREADTH OF OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES PORTFOLIO, OUR LARGE GLOBAL PARTNER AND CUSTOMER BASE, OUR GROWING ECOSYSTEM, AND OUR ONGOING

INVESTMENT IN INNOVATION POSITION US TO BE A LEADER IN THESE AREAS AND DIFFERENTIATE OURSELVES FROM COMPETITORS.

OPERATING SEGMENTS

WE OPERATE OUR BUSINESS IN SIX SEGMENTS. OUR DEVICES AND CONSUMER (D&C) SEGMENTS INCLUDE D&C LICENSING, COMPUTING AND GAMING HARDWARE, PHONE HARDWARE, AND D&C OTHER. OUR COMMERCIAL SEGMENTS

INCLUDE COMMERCIAL LICENSING AND COMMERCIAL OTHER. OUR SEGMENTS PROVIDE MANAGEMENT WITH A COMPREHENSIVE FINANCIAL VIEW OF OUR KEY BUSINESSES. THE SEGMENTS ENABLE THE ALIGNMENT OF STRATEGIES AND OBJECTIVES ACROSS THE DEVELOPMENT, SALES, MARKETING,

AND SERVICES ORGANIZATIONS, AND THEY PROVIDE A FRAMEWORK FOR TIMELY AND RATIONAL ALLOCATION OF DEVELOPMENT, SALES, MARKETING, AND SERVICES RESOURCES WITHIN BUSINESSES. IN JUNE 2015, WE ANNOUNCED A CHANGE IN ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE AS PART OF OUR

TRANSFORMATION IN THE MOBILE-FIRST, CLOUD-FIRST WORLD. AS WE EVOLVE HOW WE ALLOCATE RESOURCES AND ANALYZE PERFORMANCE IN THE NEW STRUCTURE, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT OUR SEGMENTS MAY CHANGE.

ON APRIL 25, 2014, WE ACQUIRED SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF NOKIA CORPORATIONS (NOKIA) DEVICES AND SERVICES BUSINESS

(NDS). WE REPORT THE FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE OF THE ACQUIRED BUSINESS IN OUR PHONE HARDWARE SEGMENT. PRIOR TO THE ACQUISITION OF NDS, FINANCIAL RESULTS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR JOINT STRATEGIC INITIATIVES WITH NOKIA WERE REFLECTED IN OUR

D&C LICENSING SEGMENT. THE CONTRACTUAL RELATIONSHIP WITH NOKIA RELATED TO THOSE INITIATIVES ENDED IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE ACQUISITION.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON OUR OPERATING SEGMENTS AND GEOGRAPHIC AND PRODUCT INFORMATION IS CONTAINED IN NOTE 22  SEGMENT INFORMATION AND GEOGRAPHIC DATA OF THE NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (PART

OUR D&C SEGMENTS DEVELOP, MANUFACTURE, MARKET, AND SUPPORT PRODUCTS AND SERVICES DESIGNED TO ENTERTAIN AND CONNECT PEOPLE, INCREASE PERSONAL PRODUCTIVITY, HELP PEOPLE SIMPLIFY TASKS AND MAKE MORE INFORMED

DECISIONS ONLINE, AND HELP ADVERTISERS CONNECT WITH AUDIENCES. OUR D&C SEGMENTS ARE MADE UP OF D&C LICENSING, COMPUTING AND GAMING HARDWARE, PHONE HARDWARE, AND D&C OTHER.

D&C LICENSING

THE PRINCIPAL PRODUCTS AND SERVICES PROVIDED BY THE D&C LICENSING

SEGMENT ARE: WINDOWS, INCLUDING ALL OEM LICENSING (WINDOWS OEM) AND OTHER NON-VOLUME LICENSING AND ACADEMIC VOLUME LICENSING OF THE WINDOWS OPERATING SYSTEM AND RELATED SOFTWARE; NON-VOLUME LICENSING OF MICROSOFT OFFICE, COMPRISING THE

CORE OFFICE PRODUCT SET, FOR CONSUMERS (OFFICE CONSUMER); WINDOWS PHONE OPERATING SYSTEM, INCLUDING RELATED PATENT LICENSING; AND CERTAIN OTHER PATENT LICENSING REVENUE.

THE WINDOWS OPERATING SYSTEM IS DESIGNED TO DELIVER A MORE PERSONAL COMPUTING EXPERIENCE FOR USERS BY ENABLING CONSISTENCY OF EXPERIENCE,

APPLICATIONS, AND INFORMATION ACROSS THEIR DEVICES.

WINDOWS REVENUE IS IMPACTED SIGNIFICANTLY BY THE NUMBER OF WINDOWS OPERATING SYSTEM

LICENSES PURCHASED BY OEMS, WHICH THEY PRE-INSTALL ON THE DEVICES THEY SELL. IN ADDITION TO COMPUTING DEVICE MARKET VOLUME, WINDOWS REVENUE IS IMPACTED BY.



THE MIX OF COMPUTING DEVICES BASED ON FORM FACTOR AND SCREEN SIZE.



DIFFERENCES IN DEVICE MARKET DEMAND BETWEEN DEVELOPED MARKETS AND EMERGING MARKETS.



ATTACHMENT OF WINDOWS TO DEVICES SHIPPED.



CUSTOMER MIX BETWEEN CONSUMER, SMALL- AND MEDIUM-SIZED BUSINESSES, AND LARGE ENTERPRISES.



CHANGES IN INVENTORY LEVELS IN THE OEM CHANNEL.

THE VERSIONS OF OFFICE IN

COMMERCIAL LICENSING ARE DESIGNED TO INCREASE PERSONAL, TEAM, AND ORGANIZATIONAL PRODUCTIVITY THROUGH A RANGE OF PROGRAMS, SERVICES, AND SOFTWARE SOLUTIONS. OFFICE COMMERCIAL REVENUE IS MAINLY AFFECTED BY A COMBINATION OF THE DEMAND FROM COMMERCIAL

CUSTOMERS FOR VOLUME LICENSING AND SOFTWARE ASSURANCE AND THE NUMBER OF INFORMATION WORKERS IN A LICENSED ENTERPRISE. OFFICE COMMERCIAL REVENUE GROWTH DEPENDS ON OUR ABILITY TO ADD VALUE TO THE CORE PRODUCT SET AND TO CONTINUE TO EXPAND OUR PRODUCT

OFFERINGS IN OTHER AREAS SUCH AS CONTENT MANAGEMENT, ENTERPRISE SEARCH, COLLABORATION, UNIFIED COMMUNICATIONS, AND BUSINESS INTELLIGENCE. CALS PROVIDE ACCESS RIGHTS TO CERTAIN OFFICE COMMERCIAL PRODUCTS, INCLUDING EXCHANGE, SHAREPOINT, AND SKYPE FOR

BUSINESS, FORMERLY LYNC. CAL REVENUE IS REPORTED ALONG WITH THE ASSOCIATED OFFICE PRODUCT.

WINDOWS COMMERCIAL INCLUDES VOLUME LICENSING

OF THE WINDOWS OPERATING SYSTEM, EXCLUDING ACADEMIC. WINDOWS COMMERCIAL REVENUE IS AFFECTED MAINLY BY THE DEMAND FROM COMMERCIAL CUSTOMERS FOR VOLUME LICENSING AND SOFTWARE ASSURANCE, OFTEN REFLECTING THE NUMBER OF INFORMATION WORKERS IN A LICENSED

ENTERPRISE, AND IS THEREFORE RELATIVELY INDEPENDENT OF THE NUMBER OF PCS SOLD IN A GIVEN YEAR.

MICROSOFT DYNAMICS PRODUCTS PROVIDE

BUSINESS SOLUTIONS FOR FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT, CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIP MANAGEMENT, SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT, AND ANALYTICS APPLICATIONS FOR SMALL AND MID-SIZE BUSINESSES, LARGE ORGANIZATIONS, AND DIVISIONS OF GLOBAL ENTERPRISES. REVENUE IS LARGELY DRIVEN

THESE AMOUNTS REPRESENTED 13% OF REVENUE IN EACH OF THOSE YEARS. WE PLAN TO CONTINUE TO MAKE SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS IN A BROAD RANGE OF RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS.

PRODUCT AND SERVICE DEVELOPMENT AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

WE DEVELOP MOST OF OUR PRODUCTS AND

SERVICES INTERNALLY THROUGH THREE ENGINEERING GROUPS.



APPLICATIONS AND SERVICES ENGINEERING GROUP

, FOCUSES ON BROAD APPLICATIONS AND SERVICES CORE TECHNOLOGIES IN PRODUCTIVITY, COMMUNICATION, EDUCATION,

SEARCH, AND OTHER INFORMATION CATEGORIES.



CLOUD AND ENTERPRISE ENGINEERING GROUP

, FOCUSES ON DEVELOPMENT OF OUR CLOUD INFRASTRUCTURE, SERVER, DATABASE, CRM, ENTERPRISE RESOURCE PLANNING,

MANAGEMENT, DEVELOPMENT TOOLS, AND OTHER BUSINESS PROCESS APPLICATIONS AND SERVICES FOR ENTERPRISES.



WINDOWS AND DEVICES ENGINEERING GROUP

, FOCUSES ON OUR WINDOWS PLATFORM ACROSS DEVICES OF ALL TYPES, HARDWARE DEVELOPMENT OF OUR DEVICES, INCLUDING XBOX

CONSOLES, SURFACE DEVICES, LUMIA PHONES, NON-LUMIA PHONES, SURFACE HUB, MICROSOFT BAND, AND OTHER HARDWARE PRODUCTS AND ACCESSORIES, AND ASSOCIATED ONLINE MARKETPLACES.

INTERNAL DEVELOPMENT ALLOWS US TO MAINTAIN COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGES THAT COME FROM PRODUCT DIFFERENTIATION AND CLOSER TECHNICAL CONTROL OVER OUR

PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. IT ALSO GIVES US THE FREEDOM TO DECIDE WHICH MODIFICATIONS AND ENHANCEMENTS ARE MOST IMPORTANT AND WHEN THEY SHOULD BE IMPLEMENTED. WE STRIVE TO OBTAIN INFORMATION AS EARLY AS POSSIBLE ABOUT CHANGING USAGE PATTERNS AND

HARDWARE ADVANCES THAT MAY AFFECT SOFTWARE DESIGN. BEFORE RELEASING NEW SOFTWARE PLATFORMS, WE PROVIDE APPLICATION VENDORS WITH A RANGE OF RESOURCES AND GUIDELINES FOR DEVELOPMENT, TRAINING, AND TESTING. GENERALLY, WE ALSO CREATE PRODUCT

DOCUMENTATION INTERNALLY.

WE PROTECT OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY INVESTMENTS IN A VARIETY OF WAYS. WE WORK ACTIVELY IN THE U.S. AND

INTERNATIONALLY TO ENSURE THE ENFORCEMENT OF COPYRIGHT, TRADEMARK, TRADE SECRET, AND OTHER PROTECTIONS THAT APPLY TO OUR SOFTWARE AND HARDWARE PRODUCTS, SERVICES, BUSINESS PLANS, AND BRANDING. WE ARE A LEADER AMONG TECHNOLOGY COMPANIES IN PURSUING

PATENTS AND CURRENTLY HAVE A PORTFOLIO OF OVER 57,000 U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL PATENTS ISSUED AND OVER 35,000 PENDING. WHILE WE EMPLOY MUCH OF OUR INTERNALLY DEVELOPED INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY EXCLUSIVELY IN MICROSOFT PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, WE ALSO

ENGAGE IN OUTBOUND AND INBOUND LICENSING OF SPECIFIC PATENTED TECHNOLOGIES THAT ARE INCORPORATED INTO LICENSEES OR MICROSOFTS PRODUCTS. FROM TIME TO TIME, WE ENTER INTO BROADER CROSS-LICENSE AGREEMENTS WITH OTHER TECHNOLOGY COMPANIES

COVERING ENTIRE GROUPS OF PATENTS. WE ALSO PURCHASE OR LICENSE TECHNOLOGY THAT WE INCORPORATE INTO OUR PRODUCTS OR SERVICES. AT TIMES, WE MAKE SELECT INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY BROADLY AVAILABLE AT NO OR LOW COST TO ACHIEVE A STRATEGIC OBJECTIVE, SUCH AS

PROMOTING INDUSTRY STANDARDS, ADVANCING INTEROPERABILITY, OR ATTRACTING AND ENABLING OUR EXTERNAL DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY.

WHILE IT MAY

BE NECESSARY IN THE FUTURE TO SEEK OR RENEW LICENSES RELATING TO VARIOUS ASPECTS OF OUR PRODUCTS AND BUSINESS METHODS, WE BELIEVE, BASED UPON PAST EXPERIENCE AND INDUSTRY PRACTICE, SUCH LICENSES GENERALLY COULD BE OBTAINED ON COMMERCIALLY REASONABLE

TERMS. WE BELIEVE OUR CONTINUING RESEARCH AND PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT ARE NOT MATERIALLY DEPENDENT ON ANY SINGLE LICENSE OR OTHER AGREEMENT WITH A THIRD PARTY RELATING TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF OUR PRODUCTS.

INVESTING IN THE FUTURE

MICROSOFTS SUCCESS IS BASED ON OUR ABILITY TO CREATE NEW AND COMPELLING PRODUCTS, SERVICES, AND EXPERIENCES FOR OUR USERS, TO INITIATE AND EMBRACE DISRUPTIVE TECHNOLOGY TRENDS, TO ENTER NEW GEOGRAPHIC AND

PRODUCT MARKETS, AND TO DRIVE BROAD ADOPTION OF OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. WE INVEST IN A RANGE OF EMERGING TECHNOLOGY TRENDS AND BREAKTHROUGHS THAT WE BELIEVE OFFER SIGNIFICANT OPPORTUNITIES TO DELIVER VALUE TO OUR CUSTOMERS AND GROWTH FOR THE

COMPANY. BASED ON OUR ASSESSMENT OF KEY TECHNOLOGY TRENDS AND OUR BROAD FOCUS ON LONG-TERM RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, WE MAINTAIN OUR LONG-TERM COMMITMENT TO RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ACROSS A WIDE SPECTRUM OF TECHNOLOGIES, TOOLS, AND PLATFORMS

SPANNING DIGITAL WORK AND LIFE EXPERIENCES, CLOUD COMPUTING, AND DEVICES OPERATING SYSTEMS AND HARDWARE.

WHILE OUR MAIN RESEARCH AND

DEVELOPMENT FACILITIES ARE LOCATED IN REDMOND, WASHINGTON, WE ALSO OPERATE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT FACILITIES IN OTHER PARTS OF THE U.S. AND AROUND THE WORLD, INCLUDING CANADA, CHINA, DENMARK, FINLAND, FRANCE, GERMANY, INDIA, IRELAND, ISRAEL,

JAPAN, AND THE UNITED KINGDOM, AMONG OTHERS. THIS GLOBAL APPROACH HELPS US REMAIN COMPETITIVE IN LOCAL MARKETS AND ENABLES US TO CONTINUE TO ATTRACT TOP TALENT FROM ACROSS THE WORLD. WE GENERALLY FUND RESEARCH AT THE CORPORATE LEVEL TO ENSURE THAT

WE ARE LOOKING BEYOND IMMEDIATE PRODUCT CONSIDERATIONS TO OPPORTUNITIES FURTHER IN THE FUTURE. WE ALSO FUND RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES AT THE BUSINESS SEGMENT LEVEL. MUCH OF OUR BUSINESS SEGMENT LEVEL RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT IS COORDINATED

WITH OTHER SEGMENTS AND LEVERAGED ACROSS THE COMPANY.

IN ADDITION TO OUR MAIN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT OPERATIONS, WE ALSO OPERATE

MICROSOFT RESEARCH. MICROSOFT RESEARCH IS ONE OF THE WORLDS LARGEST COMPUTER SCIENCE RESEARCH ORGANIZATIONS, AND WORKS IN CLOSE COLLABORATION WITH TOP UNIVERSITIES AROUND THE WORLD TO ADVANCE THE STATE-OF-THE-ART IN COMPUTER SCIENCE, PROVIDING

US A UNIQUE PERSPECTIVE ON FUTURE TECHNOLOGY TRENDS AND CONTRIBUTING TO OUR INNOVATION.

DISTRIBUTION, SALES, AND MARKETING

WE MARKET AND DISTRIBUTE OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES THROUGH THE FOLLOWING CHANNELS: OEMS; DISTRIBUTORS AND RESELLERS; ONLINE; AND

MICROSOFT RETAIL STORES. OUR SALES FORCE PERFORMS A VARIETY OF FUNCTIONS, INCLUDING WORKING DIRECTLY WITH ENTERPRISES AND PUBLIC SECTOR ORGANIZATIONS WORLDWIDE TO IDENTIFY AND MEET THEIR SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS; MANAGING OEM RELATIONSHIPS; AND

SUPPORTING SOLUTION INTEGRATORS, INDEPENDENT SOFTWARE VENDORS, AND OTHER PARTNERS WHO ENGAGE DIRECTLY WITH OUR CUSTOMERS TO PERFORM SALES, CONSULTING, AND FULFILLMENT FUNCTIONS FOR OUR PRODUCTS.

OEMS

WE DISTRIBUTE SOFTWARE THROUGH OEMS

THAT PRE-INSTALL OUR SOFTWARE ON NEW PCS, TABLETS, SERVERS, PHONES, AND OTHER INTELLIGENT DEVICES THAT THEY SELL. THE LARGEST COMPONENT OF THE OEM BUSINESS IS THE WINDOWS OPERATING SYSTEM PRE-INSTALLED ON COMPUTING DEVICES. OEMS ALSO SELL HARDWARE

PRE-INSTALLED WITH OTHER MICROSOFT PRODUCTS, INCLUDING SERVER AND EMBEDDED OPERATING SYSTEMS AND APPLICATIONS SUCH AS OUR MICROSOFT OFFICE SUITE. IN ADDITION TO THESE PRODUCTS, WE ALSO MARKET OUR SERVICES THROUGH OEMS AND SERVICE BUNDLES SUCH AS

WINDOWS WITH BING OR WINDOWS WITH OFFICE 365 SUBSCRIPTION.

THERE ARE TWO BROAD CATEGORIES OF OEMS. THE LARGEST OEMS, MANY OF WHICH

OPERATE GLOBALLY, ARE REFERRED TO AS DIRECT OEMS, AS OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH THEM IS MANAGED THROUGH A DIRECT AGREEMENT BETWEEN MICROSOFT AND THE OEM. WE HAVE DISTRIBUTION AGREEMENTS COVERING ONE OR MORE OF OUR PRODUCTS WITH VIRTUALLY ALL

OF THE MULTINATIONAL OEMS, INCLUDING ACER, ASUSTEK, DELL, FUJITSU, HEWLETT-PACKARD, LENOVO, SAMSUNG, TOSHIBA, AND WITH MANY REGIONAL AND LOCAL OEMS. THE SECOND BROAD CATEGORY OF OEMS CONSISTS OF LOWER-VOLUME PC MANUFACTURERS (ALSO CALLED

SYSTEM BUILDERS), WHICH SOURCE THEIR MICROSOFT SOFTWARE FOR PRE-INSTALLATION AND LOCAL REDISTRIBUTION PRIMARILY THROUGH THE MICROSOFT DISTRIBUTOR CHANNEL RATHER THAN THROUGH A DIRECT AGREEMENT OR RELATIONSHIP WITH MICROSOFT.

DISTRIBUTORS AND RESELLERS

MANY

ORGANIZATIONS THAT LICENSE OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES THROUGH ENTERPRISE AGREEMENTS TRANSACT DIRECTLY WITH US, WITH SALES SUPPORT FROM SOLUTION INTEGRATORS, INDEPENDENT SOFTWARE VENDORS, WEB AGENCIES, AND DEVELOPERS THAT ADVISE ORGANIZATIONS ON

LICENSING OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES (ENTERPRISE AGREEMENT DIRECT ADVISORS, OR EDAS).

WITH CHANGING AND DISRUPTIVE TECHNOLOGIES, SHIFTING USER NEEDS, AND FREQUENT INTRODUCTIONS OF NEW PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. OUR ABILITY TO REMAIN COMPETITIVE DEPENDS ON OUR SUCCESS IN MAKING INNOVATIVE PRODUCTS, DEVICES, AND SERVICES THAT APPEAL TO

BUSINESSES AND CONSUMERS.

COMPETITION AMONG PLATFORMS, ECOSYSTEMS, AND DEVICES

AN IMPORTANT ELEMENT OF OUR BUSINESS MODEL HAS BEEN TO CREATE PLATFORM-BASED ECOSYSTEMS ON WHICH MANY PARTICIPANTS CAN BUILD DIVERSE SOLUTIONS. A

WELL-ESTABLISHED ECOSYSTEM CREATES BENEFICIAL NETWORK EFFECTS AMONG USERS, APPLICATION DEVELOPERS, AND THE PLATFORM PROVIDER THAT CAN ACCELERATE GROWTH. ESTABLISHING SIGNIFICANT SCALE IN THE MARKETPLACE IS NECESSARY TO ACHIEVE AND MAINTAIN

ATTRACTIVE MARGINS. WE FACE SIGNIFICANT COMPETITION FROM FIRMS THAT PROVIDE COMPETING PLATFORMS, APPLICATIONS, AND SERVICES.



A COMPETING VERTICALLY-INTEGRATED MODEL, IN WHICH A SINGLE FIRM CONTROLS THE SOFTWARE AND HARDWARE ELEMENTS OF A PRODUCT AND RELATED SERVICES, HAS SUCCEEDED

WITH SOME CONSUMER PRODUCTS SUCH AS PERSONAL COMPUTERS, TABLETS, PHONES, GAMING CONSOLES, AND WEARABLES. COMPETITORS PURSUING THIS MODEL ALSO EARN REVENUE FROM SERVICES INTEGRATED WITH THE HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE PLATFORM. WE ALSO OFFER SOME

VERTICALLY-INTEGRATED HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES; HOWEVER, OUR COMPETITORS IN SMARTPHONES AND TABLETS HAVE ESTABLISHED SIGNIFICANTLY LARGER USER BASES. SHIFTING A PORTION OF OUR BUSINESS TO A VERTICALLY INTEGRATED MODEL WILL

INCREASE OUR COST OF REVENUE AND REDUCE OUR OPERATING MARGINS.



WE DERIVE SUBSTANTIAL REVENUE FROM LICENSES OF WINDOWS OPERATING SYSTEMS ON PERSONAL COMPUTERS. WE FACE SIGNIFICANT COMPETITION FROM COMPETING PLATFORMS

DEVELOPED FOR NEW DEVICES AND FORM FACTORS SUCH AS SMARTPHONES AND TABLET COMPUTERS. THESE DEVICES COMPETE ON MULTIPLE BASES INCLUDING PRICE AND THE PERCEIVED UTILITY OF THE DEVICE AND ITS PLATFORM. USERS ARE INCREASINGLY TURNING TO THESE DEVICES TO

PERFORM FUNCTIONS THAT IN THE PAST WERE PERFORMED BY PERSONAL COMPUTERS. EVEN IF MANY USERS VIEW THESE DEVICES AS COMPLEMENTARY TO A PERSONAL COMPUTER, THE PREVALENCE OF THESE DEVICES MAY MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT TO ATTRACT APPLICATION DEVELOPERS TO

OUR PC OPERATING SYSTEM PLATFORMS. COMPETING WITH OPERATING SYSTEMS LICENSED AT LOW OR NO COST MAY DECREASE OUR PC OPERATING SYSTEM MARGINS. IN ADDITION, SOME OF OUR DEVICES COMPETE WITH PRODUCTS MADE BY OUR OEM PARTNERS, WHICH MAY AFFECT THEIR

COMMITMENT TO OUR PLATFORM.



THE SUCCESS OF THE WINDOWS PHONE PLATFORM IS AN IMPORTANT ELEMENT OF OUR GOAL TO ENHANCE PERSONAL PRODUCTIVITY IN A MOBILE-FIRST AND CLOUD-FIRST WORLD. THE

MARKETPLACE AMONG MOBILE PHONE PLATFORMS IS HIGHLY COMPETITIVE. WE MAY FACE ISSUES IN SELECTING, ENGAGING, OR SECURING SUPPORT FROM OPERATORS AND RETAILERS FOR WINDOWS PHONES DUE TO, FOR INSTANCE, INADEQUATE SALES TRAINING OR INCENTIVES, OR

INSUFFICIENT MARKETING SUPPORT FOR THE WINDOWS PHONE PLATFORM.



COMPETING PLATFORMS HAVE APPLICATION MARKETPLACES (SOMETIMES REFERRED TO AS STORES) WITH SCALE AND SIGNIFICANT INSTALLED BASES. THE VARIETY AND

UTILITY OF APPLICATIONS AVAILABLE ON A PLATFORM ARE IMPORTANT TO DEVICE PURCHASING DECISIONS. USERS INCUR COSTS TO MOVE DATA AND BUY NEW APPLICATIONS WHEN SWITCHING PLATFORMS. TO COMPETE, WE MUST SUCCESSFULLY ENLIST DEVELOPERS TO WRITE

APPLICATIONS FOR OUR MARKETPLACE AND ENSURE THAT THESE APPLICATIONS HAVE HIGH QUALITY, CUSTOMER APPEAL, AND VALUE. EFFORTS TO COMPETE WITH COMPETITORS APPLICATION MARKETPLACES MAY INCREASE OUR COST OF REVENUE AND LOWER OUR OPERATING MARGINS.

BUSINESS MODEL COMPETITION

COMPANIES COMPETE WITH US BASED ON A GROWING VARIETY OF BUSINESS MODELS.



EVEN AS WE TRANSITION TO A MOBILE-FIRST AND CLOUD-FIRST STRATEGY, THE LICENSE-BASED PROPRIETARY SOFTWARE MODEL GENERATES MOST OF OUR SOFTWARE REVENUE. WE BEAR

THE COSTS OF CONVERTING ORIGINAL IDEAS INTO SOFTWARE PRODUCTS THROUGH INVESTMENTS IN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, OFFSETTING THESE COSTS WITH THE REVENUE RECEIVED FROM LICENSING OUR PRODUCTS. MANY OF OUR COMPETITORS ALSO DEVELOP AND SELL SOFTWARE TO

BUSINESSES AND CONSUMERS UNDER THIS MODEL.



OTHER COMPETITORS DEVELOP AND OFFER FREE APPLICATIONS, ONLINE SERVICES AND CONTENT, AND MAKE MONEY BY SELLING THIRD-PARTY ADVERTISING. ADVERTISING REVENUE

FUNDS DEVELOPMENT OF PRODUCTS AND SERVICES THESE COMPETITORS PROVIDE TO USERS AT NO OR LITTLE COST, COMPETING DIRECTLY WITH OUR REVENUE-GENERATING PRODUCTS.



SOME COMPANIES COMPETE WITH US USING AN OPEN SOURCE BUSINESS MODEL BY MODIFYING AND THEN DISTRIBUTING OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE AT NOMINAL COST TO END-USERS, AND

EARNING REVENUE ON ADVERTISING OR COMPLEMENTARY SERVICES AND PRODUCTS. THESE FIRMS DO NOT BEAR THE FULL COSTS OF RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT FOR THE SOFTWARE. SOME OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE VENDORS DEVELOP SOFTWARE THAT MIMICS THE FEATURES AND FUNCTIONALITY

OF OUR PRODUCTS.

THE COMPETITIVE PRESSURES DESCRIBED ABOVE MAY CAUSE DECREASED SALES VOLUMES, PRICE REDUCTIONS,

AND/OR INCREASED OPERATING COSTS, SUCH AS FOR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, MARKETING, AND SALES INCENTIVES. THIS MAY LEAD TO LOWER REVENUE, GROSS MARGINS, AND OPERATING INCOME.

OUR INCREASING FOCUS ON SERVICES PRESENTS EXECUTION AND COMPETITIVE RISKS.

A GROWING PART OF OUR BUSINESS INVOLVES CLOUD-BASED SERVICES AVAILABLE ACROSS THE SPECTRUM OF COMPUTING

DEVICES. OUR STRATEGIC VISION IS TO COMPETE AND GROW AS A PRODUCTIVITY AND PLATFORM COMPANY FOR THE MOBILE-FIRST AND CLOUD-FIRST WORLD. AT THE SAME TIME, OUR COMPETITORS ARE RAPIDLY DEVELOPING AND DEPLOYING CLOUD-BASED SERVICES FOR CONSUMERS AND

BUSINESS CUSTOMERS. PRICING AND DELIVERY MODELS ARE EVOLVING. DEVICES AND FORM FACTORS INFLUENCE HOW USERS ACCESS SERVICES IN THE CLOUD AND SOMETIMES THE USERS CHOICE OF WHICH SUITE OF CLOUD-BASED SERVICES TO USE. WE ARE DEVOTING SIGNIFICANT

RESOURCES TO DEVELOP AND DEPLOY OUR CLOUD-BASED STRATEGIES. THE WINDOWS ECOSYSTEM MUST CONTINUE TO EVOLVE WITH THIS CHANGING ENVIRONMENT. WE ARE UNDERTAKING CULTURAL AND ORGANIZATIONAL CHANGES TO DRIVE ACCOUNTABILITY AND ELIMINATE OBSTACLES TO

INNOVATION. THE COMPANYS INCREASING RELIANCE ON DATA-DRIVEN INSIGHTS IS BECOMING MORE IMPORTANT TO THE SUCCESS OF KEY OPPORTUNITIES IN MONETIZATION, CUSTOMER PERCEPTIONS OF QUALITY, AND OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCY. BESIDES SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT

COSTS, WE ARE INCURRING COSTS TO BUILD AND MAINTAIN INFRASTRUCTURE TO SUPPORT CLOUD COMPUTING SERVICES. THESE COSTS WILL REDUCE THE OPERATING MARGINS WE HAVE PREVIOUSLY ACHIEVED. WHETHER WE SUCCEED IN CLOUD-BASED SERVICES DEPENDS ON OUR EXECUTION IN

SEVERAL AREAS, INCLUDING.



CONTINUING TO BRING TO MARKET COMPELLING CLOUD-BASED EXPERIENCES THAT GENERATE INCREASING TRAFFIC AND MARKET SHARE.



MAINTAINING THE UTILITY, COMPATIBILITY, AND PERFORMANCE OF OUR CLOUD-BASED SERVICES ON THE GROWING ARRAY OF COMPUTING DEVICES, INCLUDING PCS, SMARTPHONES,

TABLETS, GAMING CONSOLES, AND OTHER TELEVISION-RELATED DEVICES.



CONTINUING TO ENHANCE THE ATTRACTIVENESS OF OUR CLOUD PLATFORMS TO THIRD-PARTY DEVELOPERS.



ENSURING OUR CLOUD-BASED SERVICES MEET THE RELIABILITY EXPECTATIONS OF OUR CUSTOMERS AND MAINTAIN THE SECURITY OF THEIR DATA.



MAKING OUR SUITE OF CLOUD-BASED SERVICES PLATFORM AGNOSTIC, AVAILABLE ON A WIDE RANGE OF DEVICES AND ECOSYSTEMS, INCLUDING THOSE OF OUR COMPETITORS.

IT IS UNCERTAIN WHETHER OUR STRATEGIES WILL ATTRACT THE USERS OR GENERATE THE REVENUE REQUIRED TO SUCCEED. IF WE ARE

NOT EFFECTIVE IN EXECUTING ORGANIZATIONAL AND TECHNICAL CHANGES TO INCREASE EFFICIENCY AND ACCELERATE INNOVATION, OR IF WE FAIL TO GENERATE SUFFICIENT USAGE OF OUR NEW PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, WE MAY NOT GROW REVENUE IN LINE WITH THE INFRASTRUCTURE

AND DEVELOPMENT INVESTMENTS DESCRIBED ABOVE. THIS MAY NEGATIVELY IMPACT GROSS MARGINS AND OPERATING INCOME.

WE MAKE SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS IN NEW PRODUCTS AND SERVICES THAT MAY NOT ACHIEVE EXPECTED

RETURNS.

WE WILL CONTINUE TO MAKE SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS IN RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT, AND MARKETING FOR EXISTING PRODUCTS, SERVICES, AND TECHNOLOGIES, INCLUDING THE WINDOWS OPERATING SYSTEM, THE MICROSOFT OFFICE SYSTEM,

BING, WINDOWS PHONE, WINDOWS SERVER, THE WINDOWS STORE, THE MICROSOFT AZURE SERVICES PLATFORM, OFFICE 365, OTHER CLOUD-BASED SERVICES OFFERINGS, AND THE XBOX ENTERTAINMENT PLATFORM. WE ALSO INVEST IN THE DEVELOPMENT AND ACQUISITION OF A VARIETY OF

HARDWARE FOR PRODUCTIVITY, COMMUNICATION, AND ENTERTAINMENT INCLUDING PCS, TABLETS, PHONES, AND GAMING DEVICES. INVESTMENTS IN NEW TECHNOLOGY ARE SPECULATIVE. COMMERCIAL SUCCESS DEPENDS ON MANY FACTORS, INCLUDING INNOVATIVENESS, DEVELOPER SUPPORT,

AND EFFECTIVE DISTRIBUTION AND MARKETING. IF CUSTOMERS DO NOT PERCEIVE OUR LATEST OFFERINGS AS PROVIDING SIGNIFICANT NEW FUNCTIONALITY OR OTHER VALUE, THEY MAY REDUCE THEIR PURCHASES OF NEW SOFTWARE AND HARDWARE PRODUCTS OR UPGRADES, UNFAVORABLY

AFFECTING REVENUE. WE MAY NOT ACHIEVE SIGNIFICANT REVENUE FROM NEW PRODUCT, SERVICE, AND DISTRIBUTION CHANNEL INVESTMENTS FOR SEVERAL YEARS, IF AT ALL. NEW PRODUCTS AND SERVICES MAY NOT BE PROFITABLE, AND EVEN IF THEY ARE PROFITABLE, OPERATING

MARGINS FOR SOME NEW PRODUCTS AND BUSINESSES WILL NOT BE AS HIGH AS THE MARGINS WE HAVE EXPERIENCED HISTORICALLY.

THE LAUNCH OF WINDOWS

10, WITH FREE UPGRADES AVAILABLE TO EXISTING USERS OF WINDOWS 7 AND 8.1, CONSTITUTES THE MOST AMBITIOUS UPDATE EFFORT WE HAVE EVER UNDERTAKEN. WE HAVE DONE EXTENSIVE PREPARATION AND COMPATIBILITY TESTING FOR APPLICATIONS AND DEVICES TO HELP ENSURE A

POSITIVE EXPERIENCE FOR OUR USERS INSTALLING WINDOWS 10. HOWEVER, IF USERS HAVE A NEGATIVE UPGRADE EXPERIENCE, OR THE COMMUNITY REACTS NEGATIVELY TO THE PROCESS WE ARE FOLLOWING TO PROMOTE AND UNDERTAKE THE UPGRADES, THE RECEPTION OF WINDOWS 10

IN THE MARKETPLACE MAY BE HARMED. IN ADDITION, WE ANTICIPATE THAT WINDOWS 10 WILL ENABLE NEW POST-LICENSE MONETIZATION OPPORTUNITIES BEYOND INITIAL LICENSE REVENUES. OUR FAILURE TO REALIZE THESE OPPORTUNITIES TO THE EXTENT WE EXPECT

COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR REVENUES.

DEVELOPING NEW TECHNOLOGIES IS COMPLEX. IT CAN REQUIRE LONG DEVELOPMENT AND TESTING

PERIODS. SIGNIFICANT DELAYS IN NEW RELEASES OR SIGNIFICANT PROBLEMS IN CREATING NEW PRODUCTS OR SERVICES COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR REVENUE.

ACQUISITIONS, JOINT VENTURES, AND STRATEGIC ALLIANCES MAY HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS.

WE EXPECT TO CONTINUE MAKING ACQUISITIONS AND ENTERING INTO JOINT VENTURES AND

STRATEGIC ALLIANCES AS PART OF OUR LONG-TERM BUSINESS STRATEGY. THESE TRANSACTIONS AND ARRANGEMENTS INVOLVE SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES AND RISKS INCLUDING THAT THEY DO NOT ADVANCE OUR BUSINESS STRATEGY, THAT WE GET AN UNSATISFACTORY RETURN ON OUR

INVESTMENT, THAT WE HAVE DIFFICULTY INTEGRATING NEW EMPLOYEES, BUSINESS SYSTEMS, AND TECHNOLOGY, OR THAT THEY DISTRACT MANAGEMENT FROM OUR OTHER BUSINESSES. IF AN ARRANGEMENT FAILS TO ADEQUATELY ANTICIPATE CHANGING CIRCUMSTANCES AND INTERESTS OF A

PARTY, IT MAY RESULT IN EARLY TERMINATION OR RENEGOTIATION OF THE ARRANGEMENT. THE SUCCESS OF THESE TRANSACTIONS AND ARRANGEMENTS WILL DEPEND IN PART ON OUR ABILITY TO LEVERAGE THEM TO ENHANCE OUR EXISTING PRODUCTS AND SERVICES OR DEVELOP COMPELLING

NEW ONES. IT MAY TAKE LONGER THAN EXPECTED TO REALIZE THE FULL BENEFITS FROM THESE TRANSACTIONS AND ARRANGEMENTS, SUCH AS INCREASED REVENUE, ENHANCED EFFICIENCIES, OR INCREASED MARKET SHARE, OR THE BENEFITS MAY ULTIMATELY BE SMALLER THAN WE

EXPECTED. THESE EVENTS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR OPERATING RESULTS OR FINANCIAL CONDITION.

IF OUR GOODWILL OR AMORTIZABLE

INTANGIBLE ASSETS BECOME IMPAIRED WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO RECORD A SIGNIFICANT CHARGE TO EARNINGS.

WE ACQUIRE OTHER COMPANIES AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND MAY NOT REALIZE ALL THE ECONOMIC BENEFIT FROM THOSE ACQUISITIONS, WHICH

COULD CAUSE AN IMPAIRMENT OF GOODWILL OR INTANGIBLES. WE REVIEW OUR AMORTIZABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS FOR IMPAIRMENT WHEN EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THE CARRYING VALUE MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE. WE TEST GOODWILL FOR IMPAIRMENT AT LEAST

ANNUALLY. FACTORS THAT MAY BE A CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES, INDICATING THAT THE CARRYING VALUE OF OUR GOODWILL OR AMORTIZABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE, INCLUDE A DECLINE IN OUR STOCK PRICE AND MARKET CAPITALIZATION, REDUCED FUTURE CASH

FLOW ESTIMATES, AND SLOWER GROWTH RATES IN INDUSTRY SEGMENTS IN WHICH WE PARTICIPATE. WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO RECORD A SIGNIFICANT CHARGE IN OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS DURING THE PERIOD IN WHICH ANY IMPAIRMENT OF OUR GOODWILL OR AMORTIZABLE

INTANGIBLE ASSETS IS DETERMINED, NEGATIVELY AFFECTING OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. FOR EXAMPLE, IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF FISCAL YEAR 2012, WE RECORDED A $6.2 BILLION CHARGE FOR THE IMPAIRMENT OF GOODWILL IN OUR PREVIOUS ONLINE SERVICES DIVISION

BUSINESS (DEVICES AND CONSUMER OTHER UNDER OUR CURRENT SEGMENT STRUCTURE), AND IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF FISCAL YEAR 2015, WE RECORDED A $5.1 BILLION CHARGE FOR THE IMPAIRMENT OF GOODWILL AND A $2.2 BILLION CHARGE FOR THE IMPAIRMENT OF INTANGIBLE

ASSETS IN OUR PHONE HARDWARE SEGMENT.

WE MAY NOT EARN THE REVENUES WE EXPECT FROM OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS.

WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO ADEQUATELY PROTECT OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS

PROTECTING OUR GLOBAL INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS AND COMBATING UNLICENSED COPYING AND USE OF OUR SOFTWARE AND OTHER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY IS DIFFICULT. WHILE PIRACY ADVERSELY AFFECTS U.S. REVENUE, THE IMPACT ON

REVENUE FROM OUTSIDE THE U.S. IS MORE SIGNIFICANT, PARTICULARLY IN COUNTRIES WHERE LAWS ARE LESS PROTECTIVE OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS. OUR REVENUE IN THESE MARKETS MAY GROW SLOWER THAN THE UNDERLYING DEVICE MARKET. SIMILARLY, THE ABSENCE OF

HARMONIZED PATENT LAWS MAKES IT MORE DIFFICULT TO ENSURE CONSISTENT RESPECT FOR PATENT RIGHTS. THROUGHOUT THE WORLD, WE EDUCATE CONSUMERS ABOUT THE BENEFITS OF LICENSING GENUINE PRODUCTS AND OBTAINING INDEMNIFICATION BENEFITS FOR INTELLECTUAL

PROPERTY RISKS, AND WE EDUCATE LAWMAKERS ABOUT THE ADVANTAGES OF A BUSINESS CLIMATE WHERE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS ARE PROTECTED. REDUCTIONS IN THE LEGAL PROTECTION FOR SOFTWARE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT REVENUE.

WE MAY NOT RECEIVE EXPECTED ROYALTIES FROM OUR PATENT LICENSES

WE EXPEND SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES TO PATENT THE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY WE CREATE WITH THE EXPECTATION THAT WE WILL GENERATE REVENUES BY INCORPORATING THAT INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY IN OUR PRODUCTS OR SERVICES OR, IN SOME

INSTANCES, BY LICENSING OUR PATENTS TO OTHERS IN RETURN FOR A ROYALTY. CHANGES IN THE LAW MAY WEAKEN OUR ABILITY TO PREVENT THE USE OF PATENTED TECHNOLOGY OR COLLECT REVENUE FOR LICENSING OUR PATENTS. THESE INCLUDE LEGISLATIVE CHANGES AND

REGULATORY ACTIONS THAT MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT TO OBTAIN INJUNCTIONS, AND THE INCREASING USE OF LEGAL PROCESS TO CHALLENGE ISSUED PATENTS. SIMILARLY, LICENSEES OF OUR PATENTS MAY FAIL TO SATISFY THEIR OBLIGATIONS TO PAY US ROYALTIES, OR MAY CONTEST

THE SCOPE AND EXTENT OF THEIR OBLIGATIONS. FINALLY, THE ROYALTIES WE CAN OBTAIN TO MONETIZE OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY MAY DECLINE BECAUSE OF THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNOLOGY, SELLING PRICE CHANGES IN PRODUCTS USING LICENSED PATENTS, OR THE DIFFICULTY OF

DISCOVERING INFRINGEMENTS.

THIRD PARTIES MAY CLAIM WE INFRINGE THEIR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS.

FROM

TIME TO TIME, OTHERS CLAIM WE INFRINGE THEIR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS. THE NUMBER OF THESE CLAIMS MAY GROW BECAUSE OF CONSTANT TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE IN THE MARKETS IN WHICH WE COMPETE, THE EXTENSIVE PATENT COVERAGE OF EXISTING TECHNOLOGIES, THE

RAPID RATE OF ISSUANCE OF NEW PATENTS, AND OUR OFFERING OF FIRST-PARTY DEVICES, SUCH AS SURFACE AND LUMIA PHONES. TO RESOLVE THESE CLAIMS WE MAY ENTER INTO ROYALTY AND LICENSING AGREEMENTS ON TERMS THAT ARE LESS FAVORABLE THAN CURRENTLY AVAILABLE,

STOP SELLING OR REDESIGN AFFECTED PRODUCTS OR SERVICES, OR PAY DAMAGES TO SATISFY INDEMNIFICATION COMMITMENTS WITH OUR CUSTOMERS. THESE OUTCOMES MAY CAUSE OPERATING MARGINS TO DECLINE. BESIDES MONEY DAMAGES, IN SOME JURISDICTIONS PLAINTIFFS CAN SEEK

INJUNCTIVE RELIEF THAT MAY LIMIT OR PREVENT IMPORTING, MARKETING, AND SELLING OUR PRODUCTS OR SERVICES THAT HAVE INFRINGING TECHNOLOGIES. IN SOME COUNTRIES, SUCH AS GERMANY, AN INJUNCTION CAN BE ISSUED BEFORE THE PARTIES HAVE FULLY LITIGATED THE

VALIDITY OF THE UNDERLYING PATENTS. WE HAVE PAID SIGNIFICANT AMOUNTS TO SETTLE CLAIMS RELATED TO THE USE OF TECHNOLOGY AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS AND TO PROCURE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS AS PART OF OUR STRATEGY TO MANAGE THIS RISK, AND MAY

CONTINUE TO DO SO.

WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO PROTECT OUR SOURCE CODE FROM COPYING IF THERE IS AN UNAUTHORIZED DISCLOSURE OF SOURCE

CODE.

SOURCE CODE, THE DETAILED PROGRAM COMMANDS FOR OUR OPERATING SYSTEMS AND OTHER SOFTWARE PROGRAMS, IS CRITICAL TO OUR BUSINESS. ALTHOUGH WE LICENSE PORTIONS OF OUR APPLICATION AND OPERATING SYSTEM SOURCE CODE TO

SEVERAL LICENSEES, WE TAKE SIGNIFICANT MEASURES TO PROTECT THE SECRECY OF LARGE PORTIONS OF OUR SOURCE CODE. IF A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR SOURCE CODE LEAKS, WE MIGHT LOSE FUTURE TRADE SECRET PROTECTION FOR THAT SOURCE CODE. IT MAY BECOME EASIER

FOR THIRD PARTIES TO COMPETE WITH OUR PRODUCTS BY COPYING FUNCTIONALITY, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR REVENUE AND OPERATING MARGINS. UNAUTHORIZED DISCLOSURE OF SOURCE CODE ALSO COULD INCREASE THE SECURITY RISKS DESCRIBED IN THE NEXT PARAGRAPH.

CYBER-ATTACKS AND SECURITY VULNERABILITIES COULD LEAD TO REDUCED REVENUE, INCREASED COSTS, LIABILITY CLAIMS, OR

HARM TO OUR COMPETITIVE POSITION.

SECURITY OF MICROSOFTS INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY

THREATS TO IT SECURITY CAN TAKE A VARIETY OF FORMS. INDIVIDUAL AND GROUPS OF HACKERS, AND SOPHISTICATED ORGANIZATIONS INCLUDING STATE-SPONSORED

ORGANIZATIONS OR NATION-STATES THEMSELVES, MAY TAKE STEPS THAT POSE THREATS TO OUR CUSTOMERS AND OUR IT. THEY MAY DEVELOP AND DEPLOY MALICIOUS SOFTWARE TO ATTACK OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES AND GAIN ACCESS TO OUR NETWORKS AND DATACENTERS, OR ACT

IN A COORDINATED MANNER TO LAUNCH DISTRIBUTED DENIAL OF SERVICE OR OTHER COORDINATED ATTACKS. CYBER THREATS ARE CONSTANTLY EVOLVING, THEREBY INCREASING THE DIFFICULTY OF DETECTING AND SUCCESSFULLY DEFENDING AGAINST THEM. CYBER THREATS CAN HAVE

CASCADING IMPACTS THAT UNFOLD WITH INCREASING SPEED ACROSS OUR INTERNAL NETWORKS AND SYSTEMS, AND THOSE OF OUR PARTNERS AND CUSTOMERS. BREACHES OF OUR NETWORK OR DATA SECURITY COULD DISRUPT THE SECURITY OF OUR INTERNAL SYSTEMS AND BUSINESS

APPLICATIONS, IMPAIR OUR ABILITY TO PROVIDE SERVICES TO OUR CUSTOMERS AND PROTECT THE PRIVACY OF THEIR DATA, RESULT IN PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT DELAYS, COMPROMISE CONFIDENTIAL OR TECHNICAL BUSINESS INFORMATION HARMING OUR COMPETITIVE POSITION, RESULT IN

THEFT OR MISUSE OF OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY OR OTHER ASSETS, REQUIRE US TO ALLOCATE MORE RESOURCES TO IMPROVED TECHNOLOGIES, OR OTHERWISE ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS.

IN ADDITION, OUR INTERNAL IT ENVIRONMENT CONTINUES TO EVOLVE. OFTEN WE ARE EARLY ADOPTERS OF NEW DEVICES AND TECHNOLOGIES. WE EMBRACE NEW WAYS OF SHARING DATA AND COMMUNICATING INTERNALLY AND WITH PARTNERS AND

CUSTOMERS USING METHODS SUCH AS SOCIAL NETWORKING AND OTHER CONSUMER-ORIENTED TECHNOLOGIES. OUR BUSINESS POLICIES AND INTERNAL SECURITY CONTROLS MAY NOT KEEP PACE WITH THESE CHANGES AS NEW THREATS EMERGE.

SECURITY OF OUR PRODUCTS, SERVICES, DEVICES, AND CUSTOMERS DATA

SECURITY THREATS ARE A PARTICULAR CHALLENGE TO COMPANIES LIKE US WHOSE BUSINESS IS TECHNOLOGY PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. THREATS TO OUR OWN IT INFRASTRUCTURE CAN ALSO AFFECT OUR CUSTOMERS. CUSTOMERS USING OUR

CLOUD-BASED SERVICES RELY ON THE SECURITY OF OUR INFRASTRUCTURE TO ENSURE THE RELIABILITY OF OUR SERVICES AND THE PROTECTION OF THEIR DATA. HACKERS TEND TO FOCUS THEIR EFFORTS ON THE MOST POPULAR OPERATING SYSTEMS, PROGRAMS, AND SERVICES, INCLUDING

MANY OF OURS, AND WE EXPECT THAT TO CONTINUE. THE SECURITY OF OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES IS IMPORTANT IN OUR CUSTOMERS PURCHASING DECISIONS.

TO DEFEND AGAINST SECURITY THREATS, BOTH TO OUR INTERNAL IT SYSTEMS AND THOSE OF OUR CUSTOMERS, WE MUST CONTINUOUSLY ENGINEER MORE SECURE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, ENHANCE SECURITY AND RELIABILITY FEATURES, IMPROVE

THE DEPLOYMENT OF SOFTWARE UPDATES TO ADDRESS SECURITY VULNERABILITIES, DEVELOP MITIGATION TECHNOLOGIES THAT HELP TO SECURE CUSTOMERS FROM ATTACKS EVEN WHEN SOFTWARE UPDATES ARE NOT DEPLOYED, MAINTAIN THE DIGITAL SECURITY INFRASTRUCTURE THAT

PROTECTS THE INTEGRITY OF OUR NETWORK, PRODUCTS, AND SERVICES, AND PROVIDE CUSTOMERS SECURITY TOOLS SUCH AS FIREWALLS AND ANTI-VIRUS SOFTWARE.

THE COST OF THESE STEPS COULD REDUCE OUR OPERATING MARGINS. IF WE FAIL TO DO THESE THINGS WELL, ACTUAL OR PERCEIVED SECURITY VULNERABILITIES IN OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES COULD HARM OUR REPUTATION AND LEAD CUSTOMERS

TO REDUCE OR DELAY FUTURE PURCHASES OF PRODUCTS OR SUBSCRIPTIONS TO SERVICES, OR TO USE COMPETING PRODUCTS OR SERVICES. CUSTOMERS MAY ALSO SPEND MORE ON PROTECTING THEIR EXISTING COMPUTER SYSTEMS FROM ATTACK, WHICH COULD DELAY ADOPTION OF ADDITIONAL

PRODUCTS OR SERVICES. CUSTOMERS MAY FAIL TO UPDATE THEIR SYSTEMS, CONTINUE TO RUN SOFTWARE OR OPERATING SYSTEMS WE NO LONGER SUPPORT, OR MAY FAIL TIMELY TO INSTALL SECURITY PATCHES. ANY OF THESE ACTIONS BY CUSTOMERS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR

REVENUE. ACTUAL OR PERCEIVED VULNERABILITIES MAY LEAD TO CLAIMS AGAINST US. ALTHOUGH OUR LICENSE AGREEMENTS TYPICALLY CONTAIN PROVISIONS THAT ELIMINATE OR LIMIT OUR EXPOSURE TO LIABILITY, THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THESE PROVISIONS WILL WITHSTAND LEGAL

CHALLENGES. LEGISLATIVE OR REGULATORY ACTION IN THESE AREAS MAY INCREASE THE COSTS TO DEVELOP, IMPLEMENT, OR SECURE OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES.

DISCLOSURE OF PERSONAL DATA COULD CAUSE LIABILITY AND HARM OUR REPUTATION.

AS WE CONTINUE TO GROW THE NUMBER AND SCALE OF OUR CLOUD-BASED OFFERINGS, WE STORE AND PROCESS INCREASINGLY

LARGE AMOUNTS OF PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION OF OUR CUSTOMERS. THE CONTINUED OCCURRENCE OF HIGH-PROFILE DATA BREACHES PROVIDES EVIDENCE OF AN EXTERNAL ENVIRONMENT INCREASINGLY HOSTILE TO INFORMATION SECURITY. DESPITE OUR EFFORTS TO IMPROVE

THE SECURITY CONTROLS ACROSS OUR BUSINESS GROUPS AND GEOGRAPHIES, IT IS POSSIBLE OUR SECURITY CONTROLS OVER PERSONAL DATA, OUR

ITEM 1A

TRAINING OF EMPLOYEES AND VENDORS ON DATA SECURITY, AND OTHER PRACTICES WE FOLLOW MAY NOT PREVENT THE IMPROPER DISCLOSURE OF CUSTOMER DATA WE OR OUR VENDORS STORE AND MANAGE. IMPROPER DISCLOSURE

COULD HARM OUR REPUTATION, LEAD TO LEGAL EXPOSURE TO CUSTOMERS, OR SUBJECT US TO LIABILITY UNDER LAWS THAT PROTECT PERSONAL DATA, RESULTING IN INCREASED COSTS OR LOSS OF REVENUE. OUR SOFTWARE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES ALSO ENABLE OUR CUSTOMERS TO STORE

AND PROCESS PERSONAL DATA ON-PREMISES OR, INCREASINGLY, IN A CLOUD-BASED ENVIRONMENT WE HOST. GOVERNMENT AUTHORITIES CAN SOMETIMES REQUIRE US TO PRODUCE CUSTOMER DATA IN RESPONSE TO VALID LEGAL ORDERS. IN THE U.S. AND ELSEWHERE, WE ADVOCATE FOR

TRANSPARENCY CONCERNING THESE REQUESTS AND APPROPRIATE LIMITATIONS ON GOVERNMENT AUTHORITY TO COMPEL DISCLOSURE. DESPITE OUR EFFORTS TO PROTECT CUSTOMER DATA, PERCEPTIONS THAT THE PRIVACY OF PERSONAL INFORMATION IS NOT SATISFACTORILY PROTECTED COULD

INHIBIT SALES OF OUR PRODUCTS OR SERVICES, AND COULD LIMIT ADOPTION OF OUR CLOUD-BASED SOLUTIONS BY CONSUMERS, BUSINESSES, AND GOVERNMENT ENTITIES. ADDITIONAL SECURITY MEASURES WE MAY TAKE TO ADDRESS CUSTOMER CONCERNS, OR CONSTRAINTS ON OUR

FLEXIBILITY TO DETERMINE WHERE AND HOW TO OPERATE DATACENTERS IN RESPONSE TO CUSTOMER EXPECTATIONS OR GOVERNMENTAL RULES OR ACTIONS, MAY CAUSE HIGHER OPERATING EXPENSES.

WE MAY HAVE OUTAGES, DATA LOSSES, AND DISRUPTIONS OF OUR ONLINE SERVICES IF WE FAIL TO MAINTAIN AN ADEQUATE OPERATIONS INFRASTRUCTURE.

OUR INCREASING USER TRAFFIC, GROWTH IN SERVICES,

AND THE COMPLEXITY OF OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES DEMAND MORE COMPUTING POWER. WE SPEND SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNTS TO BUILD, PURCHASE, OR LEASE DATACENTERS AND EQUIPMENT AND TO UPGRADE OUR TECHNOLOGY AND NETWORK INFRASTRUCTURE TO HANDLE MORE TRAFFIC ON OUR

WEBSITES AND IN OUR DATACENTERS. THESE DEMANDS CONTINUE TO INCREASE AS WE INTRODUCE NEW PRODUCTS AND SERVICES AND SUPPORT THE GROWTH OF EXISTING SERVICES SUCH AS BING, EXCHANGE ONLINE, OFFICE 365, SHAREPOINT ONLINE, ONEDRIVE, SKYPE, XBOX LIVE,

MICROSOFT AZURE, OUTLOOK.COM, WINDOWS STORES, AND MICROSOFT ACCOUNT SERVICES. WE ARE RAPIDLY GROWING OUR BUSINESS OF PROVIDING A PLATFORM AND BACK-END HOSTING FOR SERVICES PROVIDED BY THIRD PARTIES TO THEIR END USERS. MAINTAINING, SECURING, AND

EXPANDING THIS INFRASTRUCTURE IS EXPENSIVE AND COMPLEX. IT REQUIRES THAT WE MAINTAIN AN INTERNET CONNECTIVITY INFRASTRUCTURE THAT IS ROBUST AND RELIABLE WITHIN COMPETITIVE AND REGULATORY CONSTRAINTS THAT CONTINUE TO EVOLVE. INEFFICIENCIES OR

OPERATIONAL FAILURES, INCLUDING TEMPORARY OR PERMANENT LOSS OF CUSTOMER DATA OR INSUFFICIENT INTERNET CONNECTIVITY, COULD DIMINISH THE QUALITY OF OUR PRODUCTS, SERVICES, AND USER EXPERIENCE RESULTING IN CONTRACTUAL LIABILITY, CLAIMS BY CUSTOMERS AND

OTHER THIRD PARTIES, DAMAGE TO OUR REPUTATION AND LOSS OF CURRENT AND POTENTIAL USERS, SUBSCRIBERS, AND ADVERTISERS, EACH OF WHICH MAY HARM OUR OPERATING RESULTS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

GOVERNMENT LITIGATION AND REGULATORY ACTIVITY RELATING TO COMPETITION RULES MAY LIMIT HOW WE DESIGN AND MARKET OUR

PRODUCTS.

AS A LEADING GLOBAL SOFTWARE AND DEVICE MAKER, WE ARE CLOSELY SCRUTINIZED BY GOVERNMENT AGENCIES UNDER U.S. AND FOREIGN COMPETITION LAWS. AN INCREASING NUMBER OF GOVERNMENTS ARE REGULATING COMPETITION LAW

ACTIVITIES AND THIS INCLUDES INCREASED SCRUTINY IN POTENTIALLY LARGE MARKETS SUCH AS THE EUROPEAN UNION, THE U.S., AND CHINA. SOME JURISDICTIONS ALSO ALLOW COMPETITORS OR CONSUMERS TO ASSERT CLAIMS OF ANTI-COMPETITIVE CONDUCT. U.S. FEDERAL AND STATE

ANTITRUST AUTHORITIES HAVE PREVIOUSLY BROUGHT ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS AND CONTINUE TO SCRUTINIZE OUR BUSINESS.

THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION

(THE COMMISSION) CLOSELY SCRUTINIZES THE DESIGN OF HIGH-VOLUME MICROSOFT PRODUCTS AND THE TERMS ON WHICH WE MAKE CERTAIN TECHNOLOGIES USED IN THESE PRODUCTS, SUCH AS FILE FORMATS, PROGRAMMING INTERFACES, AND PROTOCOLS, AVAILABLE TO OTHER

COMPANIES. IN 2004, THE COMMISSION ORDERED US TO CREATE NEW VERSIONS OF OUR WINDOWS OPERATING SYSTEM THAT DO NOT INCLUDE CERTAIN MULTIMEDIA TECHNOLOGIES AND TO PROVIDE OUR COMPETITORS WITH SPECIFICATIONS FOR HOW TO IMPLEMENT CERTAIN PROPRIETARY

WINDOWS COMMUNICATIONS PROTOCOLS IN THEIR OWN PRODUCTS. IN 2009, THE COMMISSION ACCEPTED A SET OF COMMITMENTS OFFERED BY MICROSOFT TO ADDRESS THE COMMISSIONS CONCERNS RELATING TO COMPETITION IN WEB BROWSING SOFTWARE, INCLUDING AN UNDERTAKING

TO ADDRESS COMMISSION CONCERNS RELATING TO INTEROPERABILITY. THE WEB BROWSING COMMITMENTS EXPIRED IN 2014. THE REMAINING OBLIGATIONS MAY LIMIT OUR ABILITY TO INNOVATE IN WINDOWS OR OTHER PRODUCTS IN THE FUTURE, DIMINISH THE DEVELOPER APPEAL OF THE

WINDOWS PLATFORM, AND INCREASE OUR PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT COSTS. THE AVAILABILITY OF LICENSES RELATED TO PROTOCOLS AND FILE FORMATS MAY ENABLE COMPETITORS TO DEVELOP SOFTWARE PRODUCTS THAT BETTER MIMIC THE FUNCTIONALITY OF OUR PRODUCTS, WHICH COULD

HAMPER SALES OF OUR PRODUCTS.

OUR PORTFOLIO OF FIRST-PARTY DEVICES CONTINUES TO GROW; AT THE SAME TIME OUR OEM PARTNERS OFFER A

LARGE VARIETY OF DEVICES ON OUR PLATFORMS. AS A RESULT, INCREASINGLY WE BOTH COOPERATE AND COMPETE WITH OUR OEM PARTNERS, CREATING A RISK THAT WE FAIL TO DO SO IN COMPLIANCE WITH COMPETITION RULES. REGULATORY SCRUTINY IN THIS AREA MAY INCREASE.

CERTAIN FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS, PARTICULARLY IN CHINA AND OTHER COUNTRIES IN ASIA, HAVE ADVANCED ARGUMENTS UNDER THEIR COMPETITION LAWS THAT EXERT DOWNWARD PRESSURE ON ROYALTIES FOR OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY. BECAUSE THESE JURISDICTIONS ONLY RECENTLY

IMPLEMENTED COMPETITION LAWS, THEIR ENFORCEMENT ACTIVITIES ARE UNPREDICTABLE.

GOVERNMENT REGULATORY ACTIONS AND COURT DECISIONS SUCH AS THESE MAY HINDER OUR ABILITY TO PROVIDE

THE BENEFITS OF OUR SOFTWARE TO CONSUMERS AND BUSINESSES, REDUCING THE ATTRACTIVENESS OF OUR PRODUCTS AND THE REVENUE THAT COME FROM THEM. NEW COMPETITION LAW ACTIONS COULD BE INITIATED. THE OUTCOME OF SUCH ACTIONS, OR STEPS TAKEN TO AVOID THEM,

COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT US IN A VARIETY OF WAYS, INCLUDING.



WE MAY HAVE TO CHOOSE BETWEEN WITHDRAWING PRODUCTS FROM CERTAIN GEOGRAPHIES TO AVOID FINES OR DESIGNING AND DEVELOPING ALTERNATIVE VERSIONS OF THOSE PRODUCTS

TO COMPLY WITH GOVERNMENT RULINGS, WHICH MAY ENTAIL A DELAY IN A PRODUCT RELEASE AND REMOVING FUNCTIONALITY THAT CUSTOMERS WANT OR ON WHICH DEVELOPERS RELY.



WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO MAKE AVAILABLE LICENSES TO OUR PROPRIETARY TECHNOLOGIES ON TERMS THAT DO NOT REFLECT THEIR FAIR MARKET VALUE OR DO NOT PROTECT OUR

ASSOCIATED INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY.



THE RULINGS DESCRIBED ABOVE MAY BE PRECEDENT IN OTHER COMPETITION LAW PROCEEDINGS.



WE ARE SUBJECT TO A VARIETY OF ONGOING COMMITMENTS BECAUSE OF COURT OR ADMINISTRATIVE ORDERS, CONSENT DECREES, OR OTHER VOLUNTARY ACTIONS WE HAVE TAKEN. IF WE

FAIL TO COMPLY WITH THESE COMMITMENTS, WE MAY INCUR LITIGATION COSTS AND BE SUBJECT TO SUBSTANTIAL FINES OR OTHER REMEDIAL ACTIONS.



OUR ABILITY TO REALIZE ANTICIPATED WINDOWS 10 POST-SALE MONETIZATION OPPORTUNITIES MAY BE LIMITED.

OUR GLOBAL OPERATIONS SUBJECT US TO POTENTIAL LIABILITY UNDER ANTI-CORRUPTION, TRADE PROTECTION, AND OTHER LAWS AND

REGULATIONS.

THE FOREIGN CORRUPT PRACTICES ACT AND OTHER ANTI-CORRUPTION LAWS AND REGULATIONS (ANTI-CORRUPTION LAWS) PROHIBIT CORRUPT PAYMENTS BY OUR EMPLOYEES, VENDORS, OR AGENTS. FROM TIME TO TIME, WE RECEIVE

INQUIRIES FROM AUTHORITIES IN THE U.S. AND ELSEWHERE ABOUT OUR BUSINESS ACTIVITIES OUTSIDE THE U.S. AND OUR COMPLIANCE WITH ANTI-CORRUPTION LAWS. WHILE WE DEVOTE SUBSTANTIAL RESOURCES TO OUR GLOBAL COMPLIANCE PROGRAMS AND HAVE IMPLEMENTED POLICIES,

TRAINING, AND INTERNAL CONTROLS DESIGNED TO REDUCE THE RISK OF CORRUPT PAYMENTS, OUR EMPLOYEES, VENDORS, OR AGENTS MAY VIOLATE OUR POLICIES. OUR FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH ANTI-CORRUPTION LAWS COULD RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT FINES AND PENALTIES, CRIMINAL

SANCTIONS AGAINST US, OUR OFFICERS, OR OUR EMPLOYEES, PROHIBITIONS ON THE CONDUCT OF OUR BUSINESS, AND DAMAGE TO OUR REPUTATION. OPERATIONS OUTSIDE THE U.S. MAY BE AFFECTED BY CHANGES IN TRADE PROTECTION LAWS, POLICIES, AND MEASURES, AND OTHER

REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS AFFECTING TRADE AND INVESTMENT. WE MAY BE SUBJECT TO LEGAL LIABILITY AND REPUTATIONAL DAMAGE IF WE SELL GOODS OR SERVICES IN VIOLATION OF U.S. TRADE SANCTIONS ON COUNTRIES SUCH AS IRAN, NORTH KOREA, CUBA, SUDAN, AND SYRIA.

OTHER REGULATORY AREAS THAT MAY APPLY TO OUR PRODUCTS AND ONLINE SERVICES OFFERINGS INCLUDE USER PRIVACY, TELECOMMUNICATIONS, DATA

STORAGE AND PROTECTION, AND ONLINE CONTENT. FOR EXAMPLE, REGULATORS MAY TAKE THE POSITION THAT OUR OFFERINGS SUCH AS SKYPE ARE COVERED BY LAWS REGULATING TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICES. APPLYING THESE LAWS AND REGULATIONS TO OUR BUSINESS IS OFTEN

UNCLEAR, SUBJECT TO CHANGE OVER TIME, AND SOMETIMES MAY CONFLICT FROM JURISDICTION TO JURISDICTION. ADDITIONALLY, THESE LAWS AND GOVERNMENTS APPROACH TO THEIR ENFORCEMENT, AND OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, ARE CONTINUING TO EVOLVE. INCREASING

CONCERN ABOUT GOVERNMENT SURVEILLANCE PRACTICES AROUND THE WORLD MAY LEAD TO INCREASED REGULATION REQUIRING LOCAL DATA HOSTING OBLIGATIONS OR THE USE OF DOMESTIC HOSTING PROVIDERS. COMPLIANCE WITH THESE TYPES OF REGULATION MAY INVOLVE SIGNIFICANT

COSTS OR REQUIRE CHANGES IN PRODUCTS OR BUSINESS PRACTICES THAT RESULT IN REDUCED REVENUE. NONCOMPLIANCE COULD RESULT IN THE IMPOSITION OF PENALTIES OR ORDERS WE STOP THE ALLEGED NONCOMPLIANT ACTIVITY. GEOPOLITICAL INSTABILITY MAY LEAD TO SANCTIONS

AND IMPACT OUR ABILITY TO DO BUSINESS IN SOME GEOGRAPHIES.

OUR BUSINESS DEPENDS ON OUR ABILITY TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN TALENTED

EMPLOYEES.

OUR BUSINESS IS BASED ON SUCCESSFULLY ATTRACTING AND RETAINING TALENTED EMPLOYEES. THE MARKET FOR HIGHLY SKILLED WORKERS AND LEADERS IN OUR INDUSTRY IS EXTREMELY COMPETITIVE. WE ARE LIMITED IN OUR ABILITY TO

RECRUIT INTERNATIONALLY BY RESTRICTIVE DOMESTIC IMMIGRATION LAWS. IF WE ARE LESS SUCCESSFUL IN OUR RECRUITING EFFORTS, OR IF WE CANNOT RETAIN KEY EMPLOYEES, OUR ABILITY TO DEVELOP AND DELIVER SUCCESSFUL PRODUCTS AND SERVICES MAY BE ADVERSELY

AFFECTED. EFFECTIVE SUCCESSION PLANNING IS ALSO IMPORTANT TO OUR LONG-TERM SUCCESS. FAILURE TO ENSURE EFFECTIVE TRANSFER OF KNOWLEDGE AND SMOOTH TRANSITIONS INVOLVING KEY EMPLOYEES COULD HINDER OUR STRATEGIC PLANNING AND EXECUTION.

WE HAVE CLAIMS AND LAWSUITS AGAINST US THAT MAY RESULT IN ADVERSE OUTCOMES.

WE ARE SUBJECT TO A VARIETY OF CLAIMS AND

LAWSUITS. ADVERSE OUTCOMES IN SOME OR ALL OF THESE CLAIMS MAY RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT MONETARY DAMAGES OR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF THAT COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO CONDUCT OUR BUSINESS. THE LITIGATION AND OTHER CLAIMS ARE

SUBJECT TO INHERENT UNCERTAINTIES AND MANAGEMENTS VIEW OF THESE MATTERS MAY CHANGE IN THE FUTURE. A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS COULD OCCUR FOR THE

PERIOD IN WHICH THE EFFECT OF AN UNFAVORABLE FINAL OUTCOME BECOMES PROBABLE AND REASONABLY ESTIMABLE.

WE MAY HAVE ADDITIONAL TAX

LIABILITIES.

WE ARE SUBJECT TO INCOME TAXES IN THE U.S. AND MANY FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS. SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT IS REQUIRED IN DETERMINING OUR WORLDWIDE PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES. IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF OUR BUSINESS,

THERE ARE MANY TRANSACTIONS AND CALCULATIONS WHERE THE ULTIMATE TAX DETERMINATION IS UNCERTAIN. WE REGULARLY ARE UNDER AUDIT BY TAX AUTHORITIES. ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL PRESSURES TO INCREASE TAX REVENUE IN VARIOUS JURISDICTIONS MAY MAKE

RESOLVING TAX DISPUTES FAVORABLY MORE DIFFICULT. ALTHOUGH WE BELIEVE OUR TAX ESTIMATES ARE REASONABLE, THE FINAL DETERMINATION OF TAX AUDITS AND ANY RELATED LITIGATION COULD BE MATERIALLY DIFFERENT FROM OUR HISTORICAL INCOME TAX PROVISIONS AND

ACCRUALS. THE RESULTS OF AN AUDIT OR LITIGATION COULD HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN THE PERIOD OR PERIODS IN WHICH THAT DETERMINATION IS MADE.

WE EARN A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF OUR OPERATING INCOME FROM OUTSIDE THE U.S., AND ANY REPATRIATION OF FUNDS CURRENTLY HELD IN FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS

TO THE U.S. MAY RESULT IN HIGHER EFFECTIVE TAX RATES FOR THE COMPANY. IN ADDITION, THERE HAVE BEEN PROPOSALS FROM CONGRESS TO CHANGE U.S. TAX LAWS THAT WOULD SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT HOW U.S. MULTINATIONAL CORPORATIONS ARE TAXED ON FOREIGN EARNINGS.

ALTHOUGH WE CANNOT PREDICT WHETHER OR IN WHAT FORM ANY PROPOSED LEGISLATION MAY PASS, IF ENACTED, IT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR TAX EXPENSE AND CASH FLOWS.

OUR HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE PRODUCTS MAY EXPERIENCE QUALITY OR SUPPLY PROBLEMS.

OUR VERTICALLY-INTEGRATED HARDWARE PRODUCTS SUCH AS XBOX CONSOLES, SURFACE DEVICES, PHONES, AND OTHER

DEVICES WE DESIGN, MANUFACTURE, AND MARKET ARE HIGHLY COMPLEX AND CAN HAVE DEFECTS IN DESIGN, MANUFACTURE, OR ASSOCIATED SOFTWARE. WE COULD INCUR SIGNIFICANT EXPENSES, LOST REVENUE, AND REPUTATIONAL HARM IF WE FAIL TO DETECT OR ADDRESS SUCH ISSUES

THROUGH DESIGN, TESTING, OR WARRANTY REPAIRS. WE ACQUIRE SOME DEVICE COMPONENTS FROM SOLE SUPPLIERS. OUR COMPETITORS USE SOME OF THE SAME SUPPLIERS AND THEIR DEMAND FOR HARDWARE COMPONENTS CAN AFFECT THE CAPACITY AVAILABLE TO US. IF A COMPONENT FROM

A SOLE-SOURCE SUPPLIER IS DELAYED OR BECOMES UNAVAILABLE, WHETHER BECAUSE OF SUPPLIER CAPACITY CONSTRAINT OR INDUSTRY SHORTAGES, WE MAY NOT OBTAIN TIMELY REPLACEMENT SUPPLIES, RESULTING IN REDUCED SALES. COMPONENT SHORTAGES, EXCESS OR OBSOLETE

INVENTORY, OR PRICE REDUCTIONS RESULTING IN INVENTORY ADJUSTMENTS MAY INCREASE OUR COST OF REVENUE. XBOX CONSOLES, SURFACE DEVICES, PHONES, AND OTHER HARDWARE ARE ASSEMBLED IN ASIA AND OTHER GEOGRAPHIES THAT MAY BE SUBJECT TO DISRUPTIONS IN THE

SUPPLY CHAIN, RESULTING IN SHORTAGES THAT WOULD AFFECT OUR REVENUE AND OPERATING MARGINS. THESE SAME RISKS WOULD APPLY TO ANY OTHER VERTICALLY-INTEGRATED HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE PRODUCTS WE MAY OFFER.

OUR SOFTWARE PRODUCTS ALSO MAY EXPERIENCE QUALITY OR RELIABILITY PROBLEMS. THE HIGHLY SOPHISTICATED SOFTWARE PRODUCTS WE DEVELOP MAY CONTAIN BUGS

AND OTHER DEFECTS THAT INTERFERE WITH THEIR INTENDED OPERATION. ANY DEFECTS WE DO NOT DETECT AND FIX IN PRE-RELEASE TESTING COULD CAUSE REDUCED SALES AND REVENUE, DAMAGE TO OUR REPUTATION, REPAIR OR REMEDIATION COSTS, DELAYS IN THE RELEASE OF NEW

PRODUCTS OR VERSIONS, OR LEGAL LIABILITY. ALTHOUGH OUR LICENSE AGREEMENTS TYPICALLY CONTAIN PROVISIONS THAT ELIMINATE OR LIMIT OUR EXPOSURE TO LIABILITY, THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THESE PROVISIONS WILL WITHSTAND LEGAL CHALLENGE.

OUR GLOBAL BUSINESS EXPOSES US TO OPERATIONAL AND ECONOMIC RISKS.

OUR CUSTOMERS ARE LOCATED IN OVER 200 COUNTRIES AND

A SIGNIFICANT PART OF OUR REVENUE COMES FROM INTERNATIONAL SALES. THE GLOBAL NATURE OF OUR BUSINESS CREATES OPERATIONAL AND ECONOMIC RISKS. EMERGING MARKETS ARE A SIGNIFICANT FOCUS OF OUR INTERNATIONAL GROWTH STRATEGY. THE DEVELOPING NATURE OF THESE

MARKETS PRESENTS SEVERAL RISKS, INCLUDING DETERIORATION OF SOCIAL, POLITICAL, LABOR, OR ECONOMIC CONDITIONS IN A COUNTRY OR REGION, AND DIFFICULTIES IN STAFFING AND MANAGING FOREIGN OPERATIONS. ALTHOUGH WE HEDGE A PORTION OF OUR INTERNATIONAL

CURRENCY EXPOSURE, SIGNIFICANT FLUCTUATIONS IN FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES BETWEEN THE U.S. DOLLAR AND FOREIGN CURRENCIES MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR REVENUE. COMPETITIVE OR REGULATORY PRESSURE TO MAKE OUR PRICING STRUCTURE UNIFORM MIGHT REQUIRE THAT WE

REDUCE THE SALES PRICE OF OUR SOFTWARE IN THE U.S. AND OTHER COUNTRIES.

CATASTROPHIC EVENTS OR GEOPOLITICAL CONDITIONS MAY DISRUPT

OUR BUSINESS.

A DISRUPTION OR FAILURE OF OUR SYSTEMS OR OPERATIONS BECAUSE OF A MAJOR EARTHQUAKE, WEATHER EVENT, CYBER-ATTACK, TERRORIST ATTACK, OR OTHER CATASTROPHIC EVENT COULD CAUSE DELAYS IN COMPLETING SALES, PROVIDING

SERVICES, OR PERFORMING OTHER CRITICAL FUNCTIONS. OUR CORPORATE HEADQUARTERS, A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES, AND CERTAIN OTHER ESSENTIAL BUSINESS OPERATIONS ARE IN THE SEATTLE, WASHINGTON AREA, AND WE HAVE OTHER

BUSINESS OPERATIONS IN THE

ITEM 1A, 1B, 2

SILICON VALLEY AREA OF CALIFORNIA, BOTH OF WHICH ARE SEISMICALLY ACTIVE REGIONS. A CATASTROPHIC EVENT THAT RESULTS IN THE DESTRUCTION OR DISRUPTION OF ANY OF OUR CRITICAL BUSINESS OR IT SYSTEMS

COULD HARM OUR ABILITY TO CONDUCT NORMAL BUSINESS OPERATIONS. PROVIDING OUR CUSTOMERS WITH MORE SERVICES AND SOLUTIONS IN THE CLOUD PUTS A PREMIUM ON THE RESILIENCE OF OUR SYSTEMS AND STRENGTH OF OUR BUSINESS CONTINUITY MANAGEMENT PLANS, AND

MAGNIFIES THE POTENTIAL IMPACT OF PROLONGED SERVICE OUTAGES ON OUR OPERATING RESULTS.

ABRUPT POLITICAL CHANGE, TERRORIST ACTIVITY, AND

ARMED CONFLICT POSE A RISK OF GENERAL ECONOMIC DISRUPTION IN AFFECTED COUNTRIES, WHICH MAY INCREASE OUR OPERATING COSTS. THESE CONDITIONS ALSO MAY ADD UNCERTAINTY TO THE TIMING AND BUDGET FOR TECHNOLOGY INVESTMENT DECISIONS BY OUR CUSTOMERS, AND MAY

CAUSE SUPPLY CHAIN DISRUPTIONS FOR HARDWARE MANUFACTURERS, EITHER OF WHICH MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR REVENUE. THE LONG-TERM EFFECTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE ON THE GLOBAL ECONOMY OR THE IT INDUSTRY IN PARTICULAR ARE UNCLEAR. ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS OR

CHANGES IN THE SUPPLY, DEMAND OR AVAILABLE SOURCES OF ENERGY OR OTHER NATURAL RESOURCES MAY AFFECT THE AVAILABILITY OR COST OF GOODS AND SERVICES, INCLUDING NATURAL RESOURCES, NECESSARY TO RUN OUR BUSINESS. CHANGES IN WEATHER WHERE WE OPERATE MAY

INCREASE THE COSTS OF POWERING AND COOLING COMPUTER HARDWARE WE USE TO DEVELOP SOFTWARE AND PROVIDE CLOUD-BASED SERVICES.

ADVERSE

ECONOMIC OR MARKET CONDITIONS MAY HARM OUR BUSINESS.

WORSENING ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, INCLUDING INFLATION, RECESSION, OR OTHER CHANGES IN ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, MAY CAUSE LOWER IT SPENDING AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR REVENUE. IF

DEMAND FOR PCS, SERVERS, AND OTHER COMPUTING DEVICES DECLINES, OR CONSUMER OR BUSINESS SPENDING FOR THOSE PRODUCTS DECLINES, OUR REVENUE WILL BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED. SUBSTANTIAL REVENUE COMES FROM OUR U.S. GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS. AN EXTENDED FEDERAL

GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN RESULTING FROM FAILING TO PASS BUDGET APPROPRIATIONS, ADOPT CONTINUING FUNDING RESOLUTIONS OR RAISE THE DEBT CEILING, AND OTHER BUDGETARY DECISIONS LIMITING OR DELAYING FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SPENDING, COULD REDUCE GOVERNMENT IT

SPENDING ON OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR REVENUE.

OUR PRODUCT DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM RELIES ON AN EXTENSIVE PARTNER

AND RETAIL NETWORK. OEMS BUILDING DEVICES THAT RUN OUR SOFTWARE HAVE ALSO BEEN A SIGNIFICANT MEANS OF DISTRIBUTION. THE IMPACT OF ECONOMIC CONDITIONS ON OUR PARTNERS, SUCH AS THE BANKRUPTCY OF A MAJOR DISTRIBUTOR, OEM, OR RETAILER, COULD CAUSE SALES

CHANNEL DISRUPTION.

CHALLENGING ECONOMIC CONDITIONS ALSO MAY IMPAIR THE ABILITY OF OUR CUSTOMERS TO PAY FOR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES THEY

HAVE PURCHASED. AS A RESULT, ALLOWANCES FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS AND WRITE-OFFS OF ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE MAY INCREASE.

WE MAINTAIN AN

INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO OF VARIOUS HOLDINGS, TYPES, AND MATURITIES. THESE INVESTMENTS ARE SUBJECT TO GENERAL CREDIT, LIQUIDITY, MARKET, AND INTEREST RATE RISKS, WHICH MAY BE EXACERBATED BY UNUSUAL EVENTS THAT AFFECT GLOBAL FINANCIAL MARKETS. A

SIGNIFICANT PART OF OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO COMPRISES U.S. GOVERNMENT SECURITIES. IF GLOBAL CREDIT AND EQUITY MARKETS DECLINE FOR LONG PERIODS, OR IF THERE IS A DOWNGRADE OF THE U.S. GOVERNMENT CREDIT RATING DUE TO AN ACTUAL OR THREATENED DEFAULT

ON GOVERNMENT DEBT, OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED AND WE COULD DETERMINE THAT MORE OF OUR INVESTMENTS HAVE EXPERIENCED AN OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY DECLINE IN FAIR VALUE, REQUIRING IMPAIRMENT CHARGES THAT COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR

FINANCIAL RESULTS.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

THE FOLLOWING MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (MD&A) IS INTENDED TO HELP THE READER UNDERSTAND THE

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION OF MICROSOFT CORPORATION. MD&A IS PROVIDED AS A SUPPLEMENT TO, AND SHOULD BE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH, OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND THE ACCOMPANYING NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

OVERVIEW

MICROSOFT IS A TECHNOLOGY LEADER FOCUSED ON BUILDING BEST-IN-CLASS PLATFORMS AND PRODUCTIVITY SERVICES FOR A MOBILE-FIRST, CLOUD-FIRST WORLD. WE

STRIVE TO EMPOWER EVERY PERSON AND EVERY ORGANIZATION ON THE PLANET TO ACHIEVE MORE. WE DEVELOP AND MARKET SOFTWARE, SERVICES, AND DEVICES THAT DELIVER NEW OPPORTUNITIES, GREATER CONVENIENCE, AND ENHANCED VALUE TO PEOPLES LIVES.

WE GENERATE REVENUE BY DEVELOPING, LICENSING, AND SUPPORTING A WIDE RANGE OF SOFTWARE PRODUCTS, BY OFFERING AN ARRAY OF SERVICES, INCLUDING

CLOUD-BASED SERVICES TO CONSUMERS AND BUSINESSES, BY DESIGNING, MANUFACTURING, AND SELLING DEVICES THAT INTEGRATE WITH OUR CLOUD-BASED SERVICES, AND BY DELIVERING RELEVANT ONLINE ADVERTISING TO A GLOBAL AUDIENCE. OUR MOST SIGNIFICANT EXPENSES ARE

RELATED TO COMPENSATING EMPLOYEES, DESIGNING, MANUFACTURING, MARKETING, AND SELLING OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, DATACENTER COSTS IN SUPPORT OF OUR CLOUD-BASED SERVICES, AND INCOME TAXES.

MUCH OF OUR FOCUS IN FISCAL YEAR 2015 WAS TOWARD TRANSFORMING OUR ORGANIZATION TO SUPPORT OUR STRATEGY OF BUILDING BEST-IN-CLASS PLATFORMS AND

PRODUCTIVITY SERVICES FOR A MOBILE-FIRST, CLOUD-FIRST WORLD. WE ACHIEVED PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT MILESTONES, IMPLEMENTED ORGANIZATIONAL CHANGES, AND MADE STRATEGIC AND TACTICAL MOVES TO SUPPORT THE THREE CENTRAL AMBITIONS THAT SUPPORT OUR STRATEGY.

REINVENTING PRODUCTIVITY AND BUSINESS PROCESSES; BUILDING THE INTELLIGENT CLOUD PLATFORM; AND CREATING MORE PERSONAL COMPUTING.

HIGHLIGHTS FROM FISCAL YEAR 2015 INCLUDED.



MOMENTUM CONTINUED TO GROW IN OUR COMMERCIAL CLOUD AND PRODUCTIVITY OFFERINGS AS WE SURPASSED AN $8 BILLION ANNUALIZED RUN RATE* AT THE END OF THE YEAR.



OFFICE 365 COMMERCIAL SEATS GREW 74%, AND OFFICE 365 IS NOW DEPLOYED IN FOUR OUT OF FIVE FORTUNE 500 ENTERPRISES, WITH MORE THAN HALF OF THAT INSTALL BASE

USING PREMIUM WORKLOADS. WE ALSO ADDED OVER 50,000 SMALL- AND MEDIUM-SIZED BUSINESS CUSTOMERS EACH MONTH.



SERVER PRODUCTS AND SERVICES REVENUE INCREASED 9%, DRIVEN BY GROWTH ACROSS OUR CLOUD AND ON-PREMISES SERVER PRODUCTS. AZURE REVENUE AND COMPUTE USAGE

INCREASED BY TRIPLE DIGITS IN THE FOURTH QUARTER YEAR OVER YEAR, AND WE ENDED FISCAL YEAR 2015 WITH MORE THAN 17,000 ENTERPRISE MOBILITY SERVICES CUSTOMERS.

*

ANNUALIZED RUN RATE WAS CALCULATED BY MULTIPLYING JUNE 2015 REVENUE BY TWELVE MONTHS.



WE REACHED OVER 8 MILLION PAID DYNAMICS SEATS AND REFRESHED AND ENHANCED MICROSOFT DYNAMICS ERP PRODUCTS. WE ALSO INTRODUCED NEW SOCIAL, PRODUCTIVITY,

MOBILITY, CUSTOMER SERVICE, AND MARKETING CAPABILITIES IN DYNAMICS CRM.



WE CURRENTLY HAVE MORE THAN 15 MILLION OFFICE 365 CONSUMER SUBSCRIBERS, WITH NEW CUSTOMERS SIGNING UP AT A CURRENT PACE OF NEARLY ONE MILLION PER MONTH.

WE ALSO SURPASSED 150 MILLION DOWNLOADS OF OFFICE MOBILE TO IOS AND ANDROID DEVICES.



BING EXCEEDED 20% U.S. MARKET SHARE AS WE FOCUSED OUR ADVERTISING BUSINESS ON SEARCH. IN JUNE 2015, WE ENTERED INTO AGREEMENTS WITH AOL AND APPNEXUS TO

OUTSOURCE OUR DISPLAY SALES EFFORTS.



IN HARDWARE, WE RELEASED SURFACE 3 AND EXPANDED DISTRIBUTION OF SURFACE PRO AND THE RELATED GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE GREW WITH INCREASED REVENUE, AND

INTRODUCED NEW CATEGORIES LIKE HOLOLENS  ALL WITH AN EYE TOWARD GENERATING NEW GROWTH IN WINDOWS MORE BROADLY.



XBOX CONSOLE VOLUMES GREW TO OVER 12 MILLION, AND XBOX LIVE USERS INCREASED 22%.



WE SHIPPED OVER 36 MILLION LUMIA UNITS, AND ANNOUNCED THE RESTRUCTURING OF OUR PHONE HARDWARE BUSINESS TO RUN IT MORE EFFECTIVELY NEAR-TERM WHILE DRIVING

REINVENTION LONGER TERM.



WE COMPLETED 16 ACQUISITIONS, INCLUDING MOJANG SYNERGIES AB (MOJANG), THE SWEDISH VIDEO GAME DEVELOPER OF THE MINECRAFT GAMING FRANCHISE, AND

OTHERS, TO STRENGTHEN OUR CLOUD PLATFORM AND INVEST IN MOBILE APPLICATIONS.



WE ADVANCED WINDOWS 10 TO THE THRESHOLD OF ITS LAUNCH IN JULY 2015 WITH THE HELP OF THE WINDOWS INSIDER PROGRAM, A NEW PARADIGM TO INCORPORATE UNPRECEDENTED

LEVELS OF USER AND DEVELOPER FEEDBACK IN OUR DEVELOPMENT PROCESS.

INDUSTRY TRENDS

OUR INDUSTRY IS DYNAMIC AND HIGHLY COMPETITIVE, WITH FREQUENT CHANGES IN BOTH TECHNOLOGIES AND BUSINESS MODELS. EACH INDUSTRY SHIFT IS AN

OPPORTUNITY TO CONCEIVE NEW PRODUCTS, NEW TECHNOLOGIES, OR NEW IDEAS THAT CAN FURTHER TRANSFORM THE INDUSTRY AND OUR BUSINESS. AT MICROSOFT, WE PUSH THE BOUNDARIES OF WHAT IS POSSIBLE THROUGH A BROAD RANGE OF RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES THAT

SEEK TO IDENTIFY AND ADDRESS THE CHANGING DEMANDS OF CUSTOMERS, INDUSTRY TRENDS, AND COMPETITIVE FORCES.

ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, CHALLENGES, AND RISKS

THE MARKET FOR SOFTWARE, DEVICES, AND CLOUD-BASED SERVICES IS DYNAMIC AND HIGHLY COMPETITIVE. OUR COMPETITORS ARE DEVELOPING NEW

SOFTWARE AND DEVICES, WHILE ALSO DEPLOYING COMPETING CLOUD-BASED SERVICES FOR CONSUMERS AND BUSINESSES. THE DEVICES AND FORM FACTORS CUSTOMERS PREFER EVOLVE RAPIDLY, AND INFLUENCE HOW USERS ACCESS SERVICES IN THE CLOUD, AND IN SOME CASES, THE

USERS CHOICE OF WHICH SUITE OF CLOUD-BASED SERVICES TO USE. WE MUST CONTINUE TO EVOLVE AND ADAPT OVER AN EXTENDED TIME IN PACE WITH THIS CHANGING ENVIRONMENT. THE INVESTMENTS WE ARE MAKING IN DEVICES AND INFRASTRUCTURE WILL INCREASE OUR

OPERATING COSTS AND MAY DECREASE OUR OPERATING MARGINS.

OUR SUCCESS IS HIGHLY DEPENDENT ON OUR ABILITY TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN QUALIFIED

EMPLOYEES. WE HIRE A MIX OF UNIVERSITY AND INDUSTRY TALENT WORLDWIDE. MICROSOFT COMPETES FOR TALENTED INDIVIDUALS GLOBALLY BY OFFERING AN EXCEPTIONAL WORKING ENVIRONMENT, BROAD CUSTOMER REACH, SCALE IN RESOURCES, THE ABILITY TO GROW ONES

CAREER ACROSS MANY DIFFERENT PRODUCTS AND BUSINESSES, AND COMPETITIVE COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS. AGGREGATE DEMAND FOR OUR SOFTWARE, SERVICES, AND DEVICES IS CORRELATED TO GLOBAL MACROECONOMIC AND GEOPOLITICAL FACTORS, WHICH REMAIN DYNAMIC.

OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS PROVIDE A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR TOTAL REVENUE AND EXPENSES. MANY OF THESE REVENUE AND EXPENSES ARE

DENOMINATED IN CURRENCIES OTHER THAN THE U.S. DOLLAR. AS A RESULT, CHANGES IN FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES MAY SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT REVENUE AND EXPENSES. RECENTLY, THE SIGNIFICANT STRENGTHENING OF THE U.S. DOLLAR RELATIVE TO CERTAIN FOREIGN CURRENCIES HAS

NEGATIVELY IMPACTED REPORTED REVENUE AND REDUCED REPORTED EXPENSES FROM OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS.

FORM 10-K).

SEASONALITY

OUR

REVENUE HISTORICALLY HAS FLUCTUATED QUARTERLY AND HAS GENERALLY BEEN HIGHEST IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF OUR FISCAL YEAR DUE TO CORPORATE CALENDAR YEAR-END SPENDING TRENDS IN OUR MAJOR MARKETS AND HOLIDAY SEASON SPENDING BY CONSUMERS. OUR COMPUTING AND

GAMING HARDWARE SEGMENT IS PARTICULARLY SEASONAL AS ITS PRODUCTS ARE AIMED AT THE CONSUMER MARKET AND ARE IN HIGHEST DEMAND DURING THE HOLIDAY SHOPPING SEASON. TYPICALLY, THE COMPUTING AND GAMING HARDWARE SEGMENT HAS GENERATED APPROXIMATELY 40-50%

OF ITS YEARLY REVENUE IN OUR SECOND FISCAL QUARTER.

UNEARNED REVENUE

QUARTERLY AND ANNUAL REVENUE MAY BE IMPACTED BY THE DEFERRAL OF REVENUE, INCLUDING.



REVENUE DEFERRED ON PRE-SALES OF WINDOWS TO ORIGINAL EQUIPMENT MANUFACTURERS (OEMS) AND RETAILERS BEFORE GENERAL AVAILABILITY.



REVENUE DEFERRED ON BUNDLED PRODUCTS AND SERVICES (BUNDLED OFFERINGS).



REVENUE DEFERRED ON SALES OF WINDOWS 7 WITH AN OPTION TO UPGRADE TO WINDOWS 8 PRO AT A DISCOUNTED PRICE (THE WINDOWS UPGRADE OFFER).

IF OUR CUSTOMERS CHOOSE TO LICENSE CLOUD-BASED VERSIONS OF OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES RATHER THAN LICENSING

TRANSACTION-BASED PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, THE ASSOCIATED REVENUE WILL SHIFT FROM BEING RECOGNIZED AT THE TIME OF THE TRANSACTION TO BEING RECOGNIZED OVER THE SUBSCRIPTION PERIOD OR UPON CONSUMPTION, AS APPLICABLE.

REVENUE INCREASED $6.7 BILLION OR 8%, REFLECTING A FULL YEAR OF PHONE HARDWARE SALES AND GROWTH IN REVENUE FROM OUR COMMERCIAL CLOUD, SURFACE, SERVER PRODUCTS, SEARCH ADVERTISING, AND XBOX LIVE TRANSACTIONS. THESE

INCREASES WERE OFFSET IN PART BY A DECLINE IN REVENUE FROM OFFICE COMMERCIAL, WINDOWS OEM, LICENSING OF WINDOWS PHONE OPERATING SYSTEM, AND OFFICE CONSUMER. REVENUE INCLUDED AN UNFAVORABLE FOREIGN CURRENCY IMPACT OF APPROXIMATELY 2%.

GROSS MARGIN INCREASED $787 MILLION OR 1%, PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER REVENUE, OFFSET IN PART BY A $6.0 BILLION OR 22% INCREASE IN COST OF REVENUE.

COST OF REVENUE INCREASED, MAINLY DUE TO PHONE HARDWARE, AS WELL AS INCREASING COSTS IN SUPPORT OF OUR COMMERCIAL CLOUD, INCLUDING $396 MILLION OF HIGHER DATACENTER EXPENSES. GROSS MARGIN, AS A PERCENTAGE OF REVENUE, IMPROVED YEAR OVER YEAR IN EACH



IMPAIRMENT, INTEGRATION, AND RESTRUCTURING EXPENSES WERE $10.0 BILLION IN THE CURRENT YEAR, REFLECTING GOODWILL AND ASSET IMPAIRMENT CHARGES OF $7.5 BILLION

RELATED TO OUR PHONE HARDWARE BUSINESS, AND $2.5 BILLION OF INTEGRATION AND RESTRUCTURING EXPENSES, DRIVEN BY COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR RESTRUCTURING PLANS.



RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES INCREASED $665 MILLION OR 6%, MAINLY DUE TO INCREASED INVESTMENT IN NEW PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, INCLUDING NDS EXPENSES,

OFFSET IN PART BY REDUCED HEADCOUNT-RELATED EXPENSES.

DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE (EPS) WERE NEGATIVELY

IMPACTED BY IMPAIRMENT, INTEGRATION, AND RESTRUCTURING EXPENSES, WHICH DECREASED DILUTED EPS BY $1.15.

SHEET AMOUNTS FROM FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATE CHANGES.

FISCAL YEAR 2015 COMPARED WITH FISCAL YEAR 2014

DIVIDENDS AND INTEREST INCOME DECREASED DUE TO LOWER YIELDS ON FIXED INCOME SECURITIES, OFFSET IN PART BY HIGHER PORTFOLIO BALANCES. INTEREST

EXPENSE INCREASED DUE TO HIGHER OUTSTANDING LONG-TERM DEBT. NET RECOGNIZED GAINS ON INVESTMENTS INCREASED PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER GAINS ON SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES, OFFSET IN PART BY HIGHER OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENTS. OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY

IMPAIRMENTS WERE $183 MILLION IN FISCAL YEAR 2015, COMPARED WITH $106 MILLION IN FISCAL YEAR 2014. NET LOSSES ON DERIVATIVES INCREASED DUE TO LOSSES ON COMMODITY CONTRACTS IN THE CURRENT PERIOD AS COMPARED TO GAINS IN THE PRIOR PERIOD, OFFSET IN

PART BY LOWER LOSSES ON CURRENCY AND EQUITY CONTRACTS. FOR FISCAL YEAR 2015, OTHER REFLECTS RECOGNIZED LOSSES FROM CERTAIN JOINT VENTURES AND DIVESTITURES.

FISCAL YEAR 2014 COMPARED WITH FISCAL YEAR 2013

DIVIDENDS AND INTEREST INCOME INCREASED DUE

TO HIGHER PORTFOLIO BALANCES. INTEREST EXPENSE INCREASED DUE TO HIGHER OUTSTANDING LONG-TERM DEBT. NET RECOGNIZED GAINS ON INVESTMENTS INCREASED PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER GAINS ON SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND LOWER OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENTS.

OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENTS WERE $106 MILLION IN FISCAL YEAR 2014, COMPARED WITH $208 MILLION IN FISCAL YEAR 2013. NET LOSSES ON DERIVATIVES INCREASED DUE TO HIGHER LOSSES ON FOREIGN EXCHANGE CONTRACTS, LOSSES ON EQUITY DERIVATIVES AS COMPARED

TO GAINS IN THE PRIOR PERIOD, OFFSET IN PART BY GAINS ON COMMODITY AND INTEREST RATE DERIVATIVES AS COMPARED TO LOSSES IN THE PRIOR PERIOD. FOR FISCAL YEAR 2014, OTHER REFLECTS RECOGNIZED LOSSES FROM CERTAIN JOINT VENTURES, OFFSET IN PART BY A

RECOGNIZED GAIN ON A DIVESTITURE. FOR FISCAL YEAR 2013, OTHER REFLECTS RECOGNIZED GAINS ON DIVESTITURES, INCLUDING THE GAIN RECOGNIZED UPON THE DIVESTITURE OF OUR 50% SHARE IN THE MSNBC JOINT VENTURE.

INCOME TAXES

FISCAL YEAR 2015 COMPARED

WITH FISCAL YEAR 2014

OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR FISCAL YEARS 2015 AND 2014 WAS APPROXIMATELY 34% AND 21%, RESPECTIVELY. THE FISCAL

YEAR 2015 EFFECTIVE RATE INCREASED BY 13%, PRIMARILY DUE TO GOODWILL AND ASSET IMPAIRMENTS AND RESTRUCTURING CHARGES RECORDED IN FISCAL YEAR 2015, MOST OF WHICH DID NOT GENERATE A TAX BENEFIT. OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE WAS LOWER THAN THE U.S. FEDERAL

STATUTORY RATE PRIMARILY DUE TO FOREIGN EARNINGS TAXED AT LOWER RATES RESULTING FROM PRODUCING AND DISTRIBUTING OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES THROUGH OUR FOREIGN REGIONAL OPERATIONS CENTERS IN IRELAND, SINGAPORE, AND PUERTO RICO. IN FISCAL YEAR 2015,

THIS REDUCTION WAS MOSTLY OFFSET BY LOSSES IN FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS FOR WHICH WE MAY NOT REALIZE A TAX BENEFIT, PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF IMPAIRMENT AND RESTRUCTURING CHARGES.

CHANGES IN THE MIX OF INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES BETWEEN THE U.S. AND FOREIGN COUNTRIES ALSO

IMPACTED OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATES AND RESULTED PRIMARILY FROM CHANGES IN THE GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION OF AND CHANGES IN CONSUMER DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. WE SUPPLY OUR WINDOWS PC OPERATING SYSTEM TO CUSTOMERS THROUGH OUR U.S. REGIONAL

OPERATING CENTER, WHILE WE SUPPLY THE MICROSOFT OFFICE SYSTEM AND OUR SERVER PRODUCTS AND TOOLS TO CUSTOMERS THROUGH OUR FOREIGN REGIONAL OPERATIONS CENTERS. IN FISCAL YEARS 2015 AND 2014, OUR U.S. INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES WAS $7.4 BILLION AND

$7.1 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY, AND COMPRISED 40% AND 26%, RESPECTIVELY, OF OUR INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES. IN FISCAL YEARS 2015 AND 2014, OUR FOREIGN INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES WAS $11.1 BILLION AND $20.7 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY, AND COMPRISED 60% AND

74%, RESPECTIVELY, OF OUR INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES.

TAX CONTINGENCIES AND OTHER INCOME TAX LIABILITIES WERE $12.1 BILLION AND $10.4

BILLION AS OF JUNE 30, 2015 AND 2014, RESPECTIVELY, AND ARE INCLUDED IN OTHER LONG-TERM LIABILITIES. THIS INCREASE RELATES PRIMARILY TO ADJUSTMENTS TO PRIOR YEARS LIABILITIES FOR INTERCOMPANY TRANSFER PRICING AND ADJUSTMENTS RELATED TO

OUR IRS AUDITS. WHILE WE SETTLED A PORTION OF THE I.R.S. AUDIT FOR TAX YEARS 2004 TO 2006 DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL YEAR 2011, WE REMAIN UNDER AUDIT FOR THOSE YEARS. IN FEBRUARY 2012, THE I.R.S. WITHDREW ITS 2011 REVENUE AGENTS REPORT AND

REOPENED THE AUDIT PHASE OF THE EXAMINATION. AS OF JUNE 30, 2015, THE PRIMARY UNRESOLVED ISSUE RELATES TO TRANSFER PRICING, WHICH COULD HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IF NOT RESOLVED FAVORABLY. WE BELIEVE OUR

ALLOWANCES FOR INCOME TAX CONTINGENCIES ARE ADEQUATE. WE HAVE NOT RECEIVED A PROPOSED ASSESSMENT FOR THE UNRESOLVED ISSUES AND DO NOT EXPECT A FINAL RESOLUTION OF THESE ISSUES IN THE NEXT 12 MONTHS. BASED ON THE INFORMATION CURRENTLY AVAILABLE,

WE DO NOT ANTICIPATE A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE OR DECREASE TO OUR TAX CONTINGENCIES FOR THESE ISSUES WITHIN THE NEXT 12 MONTHS. WE ALSO CONTINUE TO BE SUBJECT TO EXAMINATION BY THE I.R.S. FOR TAX YEARS 2007 TO 2015.

WE ARE SUBJECT TO INCOME TAX IN MANY JURISDICTIONS OUTSIDE THE U.S. OUR OPERATIONS IN CERTAIN JURISDICTIONS REMAIN SUBJECT TO EXAMINATION FOR TAX

YEARS 1996 TO 2015, SOME OF WHICH ARE CURRENTLY UNDER AUDIT BY LOCAL TAX AUTHORITIES. THE RESOLUTIONS OF THESE AUDITS ARE NOT EXPECTED TO BE MATERIAL TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

FISCAL YEAR 2014 COMPARED WITH FISCAL YEAR 2013

OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR FISCAL YEARS 2014

AND 2013 WAS APPROXIMATELY 21% AND 19%, RESPECTIVELY. OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE WAS LOWER THAN THE U.S. FEDERAL STATUTORY RATE PRIMARILY DUE TO EARNINGS TAXED AT LOWER RATES IN FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS RESULTING FROM PRODUCING AND DISTRIBUTING OUR

PRODUCTS AND SERVICES THROUGH OUR FOREIGN REGIONAL OPERATIONS CENTERS IN IRELAND, SINGAPORE, AND PUERTO RICO.

OUR FISCAL YEAR 2014

EFFECTIVE RATE INCREASED BY 2% FROM FISCAL YEAR 2013 MAINLY DUE TO ADJUSTMENTS OF $458 MILLION TO PRIOR YEARS LIABILITIES FOR INTERCOMPANY TRANSFER PRICING THAT INCREASED TAXABLE INCOME IN MORE HIGHLY TAXED JURISDICTIONS, AS WELL AS LOSSES

INCURRED BY NDS AND CHANGES IN THE GEOGRAPHIC MIX OF OUR BUSINESS. THIS WAS OFFSET IN PART BY FAVORABLE TRANSFER PRICING DEVELOPMENTS IN CERTAIN FOREIGN TAX JURISDICTIONS, PRIMARILY DENMARK.

CHANGES IN THE MIX OF INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES BETWEEN THE U.S. AND FOREIGN COUNTRIES ALSO IMPACTED OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATES AND RESULTED

PRIMARILY FROM CHANGES IN THE GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION OF AND CHANGES IN CONSUMER DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. WE SUPPLY OUR WINDOWS PC OPERATING SYSTEM TO CUSTOMERS THROUGH OUR U.S. REGIONAL OPERATING CENTER, WHILE WE SUPPLY THE MICROSOFT

OFFICE SYSTEM AND OUR SERVER PRODUCTS AND TOOLS TO CUSTOMERS THROUGH OUR FOREIGN REGIONAL OPERATIONS CENTERS. WINDOWS PC OPERATING SYSTEM REVENUE DECREASED $655 MILLION IN FISCAL YEAR 2014, WHILE MICROSOFT OFFICE SYSTEM AND SERVER PRODUCTS AND TOOLS

REVENUE INCREASED $1.3 BILLION AND $1.6 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY, DURING THIS SAME PERIOD. IN FISCAL YEARS 2014 AND 2013, OUR U.S. INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES WAS $7.1 BILLION AND $6.7 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY, AND COMPRISED 26% AND 25%, RESPECTIVELY, OF

OUR INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES. IN FISCAL YEARS 2014 AND 2013, THE FOREIGN INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES WAS $20.7 BILLION AND $20.4 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY, AND COMPRISED 74% AND 75%, RESPECTIVELY, OF OUR INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES.

PRESERVATION. THEY CONSIST PREDOMINANTLY OF HIGHLY LIQUID INVESTMENT-GRADE FIXED-INCOME SECURITIES, DIVERSIFIED AMONG INDUSTRIES AND INDIVIDUAL ISSUERS. THE INVESTMENTS ARE PREDOMINANTLY U.S.

DOLLAR-DENOMINATED SECURITIES, BUT ALSO INCLUDE FOREIGN CURRENCY-DENOMINATED SECURITIES IN ORDER TO DIVERSIFY RISK. OUR FIXED-INCOME INVESTMENTS ARE EXPOSED TO INTEREST RATE RISK AND CREDIT RISK. THE CREDIT RISK AND AVERAGE MATURITY OF OUR

FIXED-INCOME PORTFOLIO ARE MANAGED TO ACHIEVE ECONOMIC RETURNS THAT CORRELATE TO CERTAIN FIXED-INCOME INDICES. THE SETTLEMENT RISK RELATED TO THESE INVESTMENTS IS INSIGNIFICANT GIVEN THAT THE SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS HELD ARE PRIMARILY HIGHLY LIQUID

INVESTMENT-GRADE FIXED-INCOME SECURITIES.

OF THE CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS, AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS AT JUNE 30, 2015, $94.4

BILLION WAS HELD BY OUR FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES AND WOULD BE SUBJECT TO MATERIAL REPATRIATION TAX EFFECTS. THE AMOUNT OF CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS, AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS HELD BY FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES SUBJECT TO OTHER RESTRICTIONS ON THE FREE FLOW OF

FUNDS (PRIMARILY CURRENCY AND OTHER LOCAL REGULATORY) WAS $2.1 BILLION. AS OF JUNE 30, 2015, APPROXIMATELY 79% OF THE CASH EQUIVALENTS AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS HELD BY OUR FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES WERE INVESTED IN U.S. GOVERNMENT AND AGENCY

SECURITIES, APPROXIMATELY 5% WERE INVESTED IN CORPORATE NOTES AND BONDS OF U.S. COMPANIES, AND APPROXIMATELY 5% WERE INVESTED IN U.S. MORTGAGE- AND ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES, ALL OF WHICH ARE DENOMINATED IN U.S. DOLLARS.

SECURITIES LENDING

WE LEND CERTAIN

FIXED-INCOME AND EQUITY SECURITIES TO INCREASE INVESTMENT RETURNS. THE LOANED SECURITIES CONTINUE TO BE CARRIED AS INVESTMENTS ON OUR BALANCE SHEET. CASH AND/OR SECURITY INTERESTS ARE RECEIVED AS COLLATERAL FOR THE LOANED SECURITIES WITH THE AMOUNT

DETERMINED BASED UPON THE UNDERLYING SECURITY LENT AND THE CREDITWORTHINESS OF THE BORROWER. CASH RECEIVED IS RECORDED AS AN ASSET WITH A CORRESPONDING LIABILITY. OUR SECURITIES LENDING PAYABLE BALANCE WAS $92 MILLION AS OF JUNE 30, 2015. OUR

AVERAGE AND MAXIMUM SECURITIES LENDING PAYABLE BALANCES FOR THE FISCAL YEAR WERE $287 MILLION AND $750 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. INTRA-YEAR VARIANCES IN THE AMOUNT OF SECURITIES LOANED ARE MAINLY DUE TO FLUCTUATIONS IN THE DEMAND FOR THE SECURITIES.

VALUATION

IN GENERAL, AND

WHERE APPLICABLE, WE USE QUOTED PRICES IN ACTIVE MARKETS FOR IDENTICAL ASSETS OR LIABILITIES TO DETERMINE THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS. THIS PRICING METHODOLOGY APPLIES TO OUR LEVEL 1 INVESTMENTS, SUCH AS EXCHANGE-TRADED MUTUAL FUNDS,

DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL EQUITIES, AND U.S. GOVERNMENT SECURITIES. IF QUOTED PRICES IN ACTIVE MARKETS FOR IDENTICAL ASSETS OR LIABILITIES ARE NOT AVAILABLE TO DETERMINE FAIR VALUE, THEN WE USE QUOTED PRICES FOR SIMILAR ASSETS AND LIABILITIES OR

INPUTS OTHER THAN THE QUOTED PRICES THAT ARE OBSERVABLE EITHER DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY. THIS PRICING METHODOLOGY APPLIES TO OUR LEVEL 2 INVESTMENTS SUCH AS CORPORATE NOTES AND BONDS, COMMON AND PREFERRED STOCK, FOREIGN GOVERNMENT BONDS, MORTGAGE- AND

ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES, U.S. GOVERNMENT AND AGENCY SECURITIES, AND CERTIFICATES OF DEPOSIT. LEVEL 3 INVESTMENTS ARE VALUED USING INTERNALLY DEVELOPED MODELS WITH UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS. ASSETS AND LIABILITIES MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE ON A RECURRING

BASIS USING UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS ARE AN IMMATERIAL PORTION OF OUR PORTFOLIO.

A MAJORITY OF OUR INVESTMENTS ARE PRICED BY PRICING VENDORS

AND ARE GENERALLY LEVEL 1 OR LEVEL 2 INVESTMENTS AS THESE VENDORS EITHER PROVIDE A QUOTED MARKET PRICE IN AN ACTIVE MARKET OR USE OBSERVABLE INPUTS FOR THEIR PRICING WITHOUT APPLYING SIGNIFICANT ADJUSTMENTS. BROKER PRICING IS USED MAINLY WHEN A

QUOTED PRICE IS NOT AVAILABLE, THE INVESTMENT IS NOT PRICED BY OUR PRICING VENDORS, OR WHEN A BROKER PRICE IS MORE REFLECTIVE OF FAIR VALUES IN THE MARKET IN WHICH THE INVESTMENT TRADES. OUR BROKER-PRICED INVESTMENTS ARE GENERALLY CLASSIFIED AS

LEVEL 2 INVESTMENTS BECAUSE THE BROKER PRICES THESE INVESTMENTS BASED ON SIMILAR ASSETS WITHOUT APPLYING SIGNIFICANT ADJUSTMENTS. IN ADDITION, ALL OF OUR BROKER-PRICED INVESTMENTS HAVE A SUFFICIENT LEVEL OF TRADING VOLUME TO DEMONSTRATE THAT THE

FAIR VALUES USED ARE APPROPRIATE FOR THESE INVESTMENTS. OUR FAIR VALUE PROCESSES INCLUDE CONTROLS THAT ARE DESIGNED TO ENSURE APPROPRIATE FAIR VALUES ARE RECORDED. THESE CONTROLS INCLUDE MODEL VALIDATION, REVIEW OF KEY MODEL INPUTS, ANALYSIS OF

PERIOD-OVER-PERIOD FLUCTUATIONS, AND INDEPENDENT RECALCULATION OF PRICES WHERE APPROPRIATE.

CASH FLOWS

FISCAL YEAR 2015 COMPARED WITH FISCAL YEAR 2014

CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS DECREASED $3.2 BILLION DURING THE FISCAL YEAR TO $29.1 BILLION, MAINLY DUE TO AN INCREASE IN MATERIALS AND PRODUCTION COSTS IN SUPPORT OF SALES GROWTH AS WELL AS PAYMENTS RELATED TO

RESTRUCTURING CHARGES AND OTHER CHANGES IN WORKING CAPITAL, OFFSET IN PART BY INCREASES IN CASH RECEIVED FROM CUSTOMERS. CASH USED IN FINANCING INCREASED $686 MILLION TO $9.1 BILLION, MAINLY DUE TO A $7.1 BILLION INCREASE IN CASH USED FOR COMMON

STOCK REPURCHASES, OFFSET IN PART BY A $6.7 BILLION INCREASE IN PROCEEDS FROM ISSUANCES OF DEBT, NET OF REPAYMENTS. CASH USED IN INVESTING INCREASED $4.2 BILLION TO $23.0 BILLION, MAINLY DUE TO A $5.5 BILLION INCREASE IN CASH USED FOR NET INVESTMENT

PURCHASES, SALES, AND MATURITIES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A $2.2 BILLION DECREASE IN CASH USED FOR ACQUISITIONS OF COMPANIES AND PURCHASES OF INTANGIBLE AND OTHER ASSETS.

FISCAL YEAR 2014 COMPARED WITH FISCAL YEAR 2013

CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS INCREASED $3.4

BILLION DURING FISCAL YEAR 2014 TO $32.2 BILLION, MAINLY DUE TO INCREASES IN CASH RECEIVED FROM CUSTOMERS. CASH USED IN FINANCING INCREASED $246 MILLION TO $8.4 BILLION, MAINLY DUE TO A $2.0 BILLION INCREASE IN CASH USED FOR COMMON STOCK

REPURCHASES, A $1.4 BILLION INCREASE IN DIVIDENDS PAID, AND A $324 MILLION DECREASE IN PROCEEDS FROM THE ISSUANCE OF COMMON STOCK, OFFSET IN PART BY A $3.4 BILLION INCREASE IN PROCEEDS FROM ISSUANCES OF DEBT, NET OF REPAYMENTS. CASH USED IN

INVESTING DECREASED $5.0 BILLION TO $18.8 BILLION, MAINLY DUE TO A $10.5 BILLION DECREASE IN CASH USED FOR NET INVESTMENT PURCHASES, SALES, AND MATURITIES, OFFSET IN PART BY A $4.4 BILLION INCREASE IN CASH USED FOR ACQUISITION OF COMPANIES AND

PURCHASES OF INTANGIBLE AND OTHER ASSETS, AND A $1.2 BILLION INCREASE IN CAPITAL EXPENDITURES FOR PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT.

DEBT

WE ISSUED DEBT TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF FAVORABLE PRICING AND LIQUIDITY IN THE DEBT MARKETS, REFLECTING OUR CREDIT RATING AND THE LOW INTEREST RATE

ENVIRONMENT. THE PROCEEDS OF THESE ISSUANCES WERE OR WILL BE USED FOR GENERAL CORPORATE PURPOSES, WHICH MAY INCLUDE, AMONG OTHER THINGS, FUNDING FOR WORKING CAPITAL, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, REPURCHASES OF CAPITAL STOCK, ACQUISITIONS, AND REPAYMENT OF

EXISTING DEBT. SEE NOTE 12  DEBT OF THE NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (PART II, ITEM 8 OF THIS FORM 10-K FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION.

SHARE REPURCHASES

ON SEPTEMBER 16, 2013, OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS APPROVED A SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM AUTHORIZING UP TO $40.0 BILLION IN SHARE REPURCHASES. THE SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM BECAME EFFECTIVE ON OCTOBER 1, 2013,

HAS NO EXPIRATION DATE, AND MAY BE SUSPENDED OR DISCONTINUED AT ANY TIME WITHOUT NOTICE. WHILE THE PROGRAM HAS NO EXPIRATION DATE, WE INTEND TO COMPLETE IT BY DECEMBER 31, 2016. AS OF JUNE 30, 2015, $21.9 BILLION REMAINED OF OUR $40.0

OTHER PLANNED USES OF CAPITAL

WE WILL CONTINUE TO INVEST IN SALES, MARKETING, PRODUCT SUPPORT INFRASTRUCTURE, AND EXISTING AND ADVANCED AREAS OF TECHNOLOGY, AS WELL AS CONTINUE MAKING ACQUISITIONS THAT ALIGN WITH OUR BUSINESS STRATEGY.

ADDITIONS TO PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT WILL CONTINUE, INCLUDING NEW FACILITIES, DATA CENTERS, AND COMPUTER SYSTEMS FOR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, SALES AND MARKETING, SUPPORT, AND ADMINISTRATIVE STAFF. WE EXPECT CAPITAL EXPENDITURES TO INCREASE IN

COMING YEARS IN SUPPORT OF OUR PRODUCTIVITY AND PLATFORM STRATEGY. WE HAVE OPERATING LEASES FOR MOST U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL SALES AND SUPPORT OFFICES AND CERTAIN EQUIPMENT. WE HAVE NOT ENGAGED IN ANY RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS OR ARRANGEMENTS WITH

UNCONSOLIDATED ENTITIES OR OTHER PERSONS THAT ARE REASONABLY LIKELY TO MATERIALLY AFFECT LIQUIDITY OR THE AVAILABILITY OF CAPITAL RESOURCES.

LIQUIDITY

WE EARN A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF

OUR OPERATING INCOME OUTSIDE THE U.S., WHICH IS DEEMED TO BE PERMANENTLY REINVESTED IN FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS. AS A RESULT, AS DISCUSSED ABOVE UNDER CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS, AND INVESTMENTS, THE MAJORITY OF OUR CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS, AND SHORT-TERM

INVESTMENTS ARE HELD BY FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES. WE CURRENTLY DO NOT INTEND NOR FORESEE A NEED TO REPATRIATE THESE FUNDS. WE EXPECT EXISTING DOMESTIC CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS, SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS, CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS, AND ACCESS TO CAPITAL

MARKETS TO CONTINUE TO BE SUFFICIENT TO FUND OUR DOMESTIC OPERATING ACTIVITIES AND CASH COMMITMENTS FOR INVESTING AND FINANCING ACTIVITIES, SUCH AS REGULAR QUARTERLY DIVIDENDS, DEBT MATURITIES, AND MATERIAL CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, FOR AT LEAST THE

NEXT 12 MONTHS AND THEREAFTER FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. IN ADDITION, WE EXPECT EXISTING FOREIGN CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS, SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS, AND CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS TO CONTINUE TO BE SUFFICIENT TO FUND OUR FOREIGN OPERATING ACTIVITIES

AND CASH COMMITMENTS FOR INVESTING ACTIVITIES, SUCH AS MATERIAL CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, FOR AT LEAST THE NEXT 12 MONTHS AND THEREAFTER FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE.

SHOULD WE REQUIRE MORE CAPITAL IN THE U.S. THAN IS GENERATED BY OUR OPERATIONS DOMESTICALLY, FOR EXAMPLE TO FUND SIGNIFICANT DISCRETIONARY ACTIVITIES, SUCH AS BUSINESS ACQUISITIONS AND SHARE REPURCHASES, WE COULD

ELECT TO REPATRIATE FUTURE EARNINGS FROM FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS OR RAISE CAPITAL IN THE U.S. THROUGH DEBT OR EQUITY ISSUANCES. THESE ALTERNATIVES COULD RESULT IN HIGHER EFFECTIVE TAX RATES, INCREASED INTEREST EXPENSE, OR DILUTION OF OUR EARNINGS. WE

HAVE BORROWED FUNDS DOMESTICALLY AND CONTINUE TO BELIEVE WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO DO SO AT REASONABLE INTEREST RATES.

RECENT ACCOUNTING

GUIDANCE

SEE NOTE 1  ACCOUNTING POLICIES OF THE NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (PART II, ITEM 8 OF THIS FORM 10-K) FOR FURTHER

DISCUSSION.

APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND ACCOMPANYING NOTES ARE PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH U.S. GAAP. PREPARING CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT

THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS, LIABILITIES, REVENUE, AND EXPENSES. THESE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS ARE AFFECTED BY MANAGEMENTS APPLICATION OF ACCOUNTING POLICIES. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES FOR US INCLUDE REVENUE RECOGNITION, IMPAIRMENT OF

INVESTMENT SECURITIES, GOODWILL, RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS, CONTINGENCIES, INCOME TAXES, AND INVENTORIES.

REVENUE RECOGNITION

REVENUE RECOGNITION FOR MULTIPLE-ELEMENT ARRANGEMENTS REQUIRES JUDGMENT TO DETERMINE IF MULTIPLE ELEMENTS EXIST, WHETHER ELEMENTS CAN BE ACCOUNTED

FOR AS SEPARATE UNITS OF ACCOUNTING, AND IF SO, THE FAIR VALUE FOR EACH OF THE ELEMENTS.

JUDGMENT IS ALSO REQUIRED TO ASSESS WHETHER

FUTURE RELEASES OF CERTAIN SOFTWARE REPRESENT NEW PRODUCTS OR UPGRADES AND ENHANCEMENTS TO EXISTING PRODUCTS. CERTAIN VOLUME LICENSING ARRANGEMENTS INCLUDE A PERPETUAL LICENSE FOR CURRENT PRODUCTS COMBINED WITH RIGHTS TO RECEIVE UNSPECIFIED FUTURE

VERSIONS OF SOFTWARE PRODUCTS AND ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AS SUBSCRIPTIONS, WITH BILLINGS RECORDED AS UNEARNED REVENUE AND RECOGNIZED AS REVENUE RATABLY OVER THE COVERAGE PERIOD.

46

TABLE OF CONTENTS

PART II

ITEM 7

SOFTWARE UPDATES ARE EVALUATED ON A CASE-BY-CASE BASIS TO DETERMINE WHETHER THEY MEET THE

DEFINITION OF AN UPGRADE, WHICH MAY REQUIRE REVENUE TO BE DEFERRED AND RECOGNIZED WHEN THE UPGRADE IS DELIVERED. IF IT IS DETERMINED THAT IMPLIED POST-CONTRACT CUSTOMER SUPPORT (PCS) IS BEING PROVIDED, REVENUE FROM THE ARRANGEMENT IS

DEFERRED AND RECOGNIZED OVER THE IMPLIED PCS TERM. IF UPDATES ARE DETERMINED TO NOT MEET THE DEFINITION OF AN UPGRADE, REVENUE IS GENERALLY RECOGNIZED AS PRODUCTS ARE SHIPPED OR MADE AVAILABLE.

MICROSOFT ENTERS INTO ARRANGEMENTS THAT CAN INCLUDE VARIOUS COMBINATIONS OF SOFTWARE, SERVICES, AND HARDWARE. WHERE ELEMENTS ARE DELIVERED OVER

DIFFERENT PERIODS OF TIME, AND WHEN ALLOWED UNDER U.S. GAAP, REVENUE IS ALLOCATED TO THE RESPECTIVE ELEMENTS BASED ON THEIR RELATIVE SELLING PRICES AT THE INCEPTION OF THE ARRANGEMENT, AND REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED AS EACH ELEMENT IS DELIVERED. WE USE A

HIERARCHY TO DETERMINE THE FAIR VALUE TO BE USED FOR ALLOCATING REVENUE TO ELEMENTS: (I) VENDOR-SPECIFIC OBJECTIVE EVIDENCE OF FAIR VALUE (VSOE), (II) THIRD-PARTY EVIDENCE, AND (III) BEST ESTIMATE OF SELLING PRICE

(ESP). FOR SOFTWARE ELEMENTS, WE FOLLOW THE INDUSTRY SPECIFIC SOFTWARE GUIDANCE WHICH ONLY ALLOWS FOR THE USE OF VSOE IN ESTABLISHING FAIR VALUE. GENERALLY, VSOE IS THE PRICE CHARGED WHEN THE DELIVERABLE IS SOLD SEPARATELY OR THE PRICE

ESTABLISHED BY MANAGEMENT FOR A PRODUCT THAT IS NOT YET SOLD IF IT IS PROBABLE THAT THE PRICE WILL NOT CHANGE BEFORE INTRODUCTION INTO THE MARKETPLACE. ESPS ARE ESTABLISHED AS BEST ESTIMATES OF WHAT THE SELLING PRICES WOULD BE IF THE DELIVERABLES

WERE SOLD REGULARLY ON A STAND-ALONE BASIS. OUR PROCESS FOR DETERMINING ESPS REQUIRES JUDGMENT AND CONSIDERS MULTIPLE FACTORS THAT MAY VARY OVER TIME DEPENDING UPON THE UNIQUE FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES RELATED TO EACH DELIVERABLE.

IN JANUARY 2015, WE ANNOUNCED WINDOWS 10 WILL BE FREE TO ALL QUALIFIED EXISTING USERS OF WINDOWS 7 AND WINDOWS 8.1. THIS OFFER DIFFERS FROM

HISTORICAL OFFERS PRECEDING THE LAUNCH OF NEW VERSIONS OF WINDOWS AS IT IS BEING MADE AVAILABLE FOR FREE TO EXISTING USERS IN ADDITION TO NEW CUSTOMERS AFTER THE OFFER ANNOUNCEMENT. WE EVALUATED THE NATURE AND ACCOUNTING TREATMENT OF THE WINDOWS 10

OFFER AND DETERMINED THAT IT REPRESENTS A MARKETING AND PROMOTIONAL ACTIVITY, IN PART BECAUSE THE OFFER IS BEING MADE AVAILABLE FOR FREE TO EXISTING USERS. AS THIS IS A MARKETING AND PROMOTIONAL ACTIVITY, REVENUE RECOGNITION OF NEW SALES OF WINDOWS

8 WILL CONTINUE TO BE RECOGNIZED AS DELIVERED.

IMPAIRMENT OF INVESTMENT SECURITIES

WE REVIEW INVESTMENTS QUARTERLY FOR INDICATORS OF OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENT. THIS DETERMINATION REQUIRES SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT. IN MAKING THIS

JUDGMENT, WE EMPLOY A SYSTEMATIC METHODOLOGY QUARTERLY THAT CONSIDERS AVAILABLE QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE EVIDENCE IN EVALUATING POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT OF OUR INVESTMENTS. IF THE COST OF AN INVESTMENT EXCEEDS ITS FAIR VALUE, WE EVALUATE, AMONG

OTHER FACTORS, GENERAL MARKET CONDITIONS, CREDIT QUALITY OF DEBT INSTRUMENT ISSUERS, THE DURATION AND EXTENT TO WHICH THE FAIR VALUE IS LESS THAN COST, AND FOR EQUITY SECURITIES, OUR INTENT AND ABILITY TO HOLD, OR PLANS TO SELL, THE INVESTMENT. FOR

FIXED-INCOME SECURITIES, WE ALSO EVALUATE WHETHER WE HAVE PLANS TO SELL THE SECURITY OR IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT WE WILL BE REQUIRED TO SELL THE SECURITY BEFORE RECOVERY. WE ALSO CONSIDER SPECIFIC ADVERSE CONDITIONS RELATED TO THE FINANCIAL

HEALTH OF AND BUSINESS OUTLOOK FOR THE INVESTEE, INCLUDING INDUSTRY AND SECTOR PERFORMANCE, CHANGES IN TECHNOLOGY, AND OPERATIONAL AND FINANCING CASH FLOW FACTORS. ONCE A DECLINE IN FAIR VALUE IS DETERMINED TO BE OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY, AN IMPAIRMENT

CHARGE IS RECORDED TO OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE), NET AND A NEW COST BASIS IN THE INVESTMENT IS ESTABLISHED. IF MARKET, INDUSTRY, AND/OR INVESTEE CONDITIONS DETERIORATE, WE MAY INCUR FUTURE IMPAIRMENTS.

GOODWILL

WE ALLOCATE GOODWILL TO REPORTING

UNITS BASED ON THE REPORTING UNIT EXPECTED TO BENEFIT FROM THE BUSINESS COMBINATION. WE EVALUATE OUR REPORTING UNITS ON AN ANNUAL BASIS AND, IF NECESSARY, REASSIGN GOODWILL USING A RELATIVE FAIR VALUE ALLOCATION APPROACH. GOODWILL IS TESTED FOR

IMPAIRMENT AT THE REPORTING UNIT LEVEL (OPERATING SEGMENT OR ONE LEVEL BELOW AN OPERATING SEGMENT) ON AN ANNUAL BASIS (MAY 1 FOR US) AND BETWEEN ANNUAL TESTS IF AN EVENT OCCURS OR CIRCUMSTANCES CHANGE THAT WOULD MORE LIKELY THAN NOT REDUCE THE FAIR

VALUE OF A REPORTING UNIT BELOW ITS CARRYING VALUE. THESE EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES COULD INCLUDE A SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN THE BUSINESS CLIMATE, LEGAL FACTORS, OPERATING PERFORMANCE INDICATORS, COMPETITION, OR SALE OR DISPOSITION OF A SIGNIFICANT

PORTION OF A REPORTING UNIT.

APPLICATION OF THE GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT TEST REQUIRES JUDGMENT, INCLUDING THE IDENTIFICATION OF REPORTING

UNITS, ASSIGNMENT OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES TO REPORTING UNITS, ASSIGNMENT OF GOODWILL TO REPORTING UNITS, AND DETERMINATION OF THE FAIR VALUE OF EACH REPORTING UNIT. THE FAIR VALUE OF EACH REPORTING UNIT IS ESTIMATED PRIMARILY THROUGH THE USE OF A

DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW METHODOLOGY. THIS ANALYSIS REQUIRES SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENTS, INCLUDING ESTIMATION OF FUTURE CASH FLOWS, WHICH IS DEPENDENT ON INTERNAL FORECASTS, ESTIMATION OF THE LONG-TERM

RATE OF GROWTH FOR OUR BUSINESS, ESTIMATION OF THE USEFUL LIFE OVER WHICH CASH FLOWS WILL OCCUR, AND DETERMINATION OF OUR WEIGHTED AVERAGE COST OF CAPITAL.

THE ESTIMATES USED TO CALCULATE THE FAIR VALUE OF A REPORTING UNIT CHANGE FROM YEAR TO YEAR BASED ON OPERATING RESULTS, MARKET CONDITIONS, AND OTHER FACTORS. CHANGES IN THESE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS COULD

MATERIALLY AFFECT THE DETERMINATION OF FAIR VALUE AND GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT FOR EACH REPORTING UNIT.

BASED ON THE RESULTS OF OUR ANNUAL

GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT TESTING AS OF MAY 1, 2015, WE DETERMINED THAT GOODWILL ASSOCIATED WITH OUR PHONE HARDWARE REPORTING UNIT WAS IMPAIRED, RESULTING IN A MATERIAL CHARGE TO EARNINGS IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF FISCAL YEAR 2015. AS OF JUNE 30,

2015, NONE OF OUR REPORTING UNITS WERE CONSIDERED TO BE AT RISK OF IMPAIRMENT.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS

COSTS INCURRED INTERNALLY IN RESEARCHING AND DEVELOPING A COMPUTER SOFTWARE PRODUCT ARE CHARGED TO EXPENSE UNTIL TECHNOLOGICAL FEASIBILITY HAS BEEN

ESTABLISHED FOR THE PRODUCT. ONCE TECHNOLOGICAL FEASIBILITY IS ESTABLISHED, ALL SOFTWARE COSTS ARE CAPITALIZED UNTIL THE PRODUCT IS AVAILABLE FOR GENERAL RELEASE TO CUSTOMERS. JUDGMENT IS REQUIRED IN DETERMINING WHEN TECHNOLOGICAL FEASIBILITY OF A

PRODUCT IS ESTABLISHED. WE HAVE DETERMINED THAT TECHNOLOGICAL FEASIBILITY FOR OUR SOFTWARE PRODUCTS IS REACHED AFTER ALL HIGH-RISK DEVELOPMENT ISSUES HAVE BEEN RESOLVED THROUGH CODING AND TESTING. GENERALLY, THIS OCCURS SHORTLY BEFORE THE PRODUCTS

ARE RELEASED TO MANUFACTURING. THE AMORTIZATION OF THESE COSTS IS INCLUDED IN COST OF REVENUE OVER THE ESTIMATED LIFE OF THE PRODUCTS.

LEGAL AND

OTHER CONTINGENCIES

THE OUTCOMES OF LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND CLAIMS BROUGHT AGAINST US ARE SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT UNCERTAINTY. AN

ESTIMATED LOSS FROM A LOSS CONTINGENCY SUCH AS A LEGAL PROCEEDING OR CLAIM IS ACCRUED BY A CHARGE TO INCOME IF IT IS PROBABLE THAT AN ASSET HAS BEEN IMPAIRED OR A LIABILITY HAS BEEN INCURRED AND THE AMOUNT OF THE LOSS CAN BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED. IN

DETERMINING WHETHER A LOSS SHOULD BE ACCRUED WE EVALUATE, AMONG OTHER FACTORS, THE DEGREE OF PROBABILITY OF AN UNFAVORABLE OUTCOME AND THE ABILITY TO MAKE A REASONABLE ESTIMATE OF THE AMOUNT OF LOSS. CHANGES IN THESE FACTORS COULD MATERIALLY IMPACT

OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

INCOME TAXES

THE OBJECTIVES OF ACCOUNTING FOR INCOME TAXES ARE TO RECOGNIZE THE AMOUNT OF TAXES PAYABLE OR REFUNDABLE FOR THE CURRENT YEAR AND DEFERRED TAX LIABILITIES AND ASSETS FOR THE FUTURE TAX CONSEQUENCES OF EVENTS THAT

HAVE BEEN RECOGNIZED IN AN ENTITYS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OR TAX RETURNS. WE RECOGNIZE THE TAX BENEFIT FROM AN UNCERTAIN TAX POSITION ONLY IF IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT THE TAX POSITION WILL BE SUSTAINED ON EXAMINATION BY THE TAXING

AUTHORITIES, BASED ON THE TECHNICAL MERITS OF THE POSITION. THE TAX BENEFITS RECOGNIZED IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FROM SUCH A POSITION ARE MEASURED BASED ON THE LARGEST BENEFIT THAT HAS A GREATER THAN 50% LIKELIHOOD OF BEING REALIZED UPON ULTIMATE

SETTLEMENT. ACCOUNTING LITERATURE ALSO PROVIDES GUIDANCE ON DERECOGNITION OF INCOME TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, CLASSIFICATION OF CURRENT AND DEFERRED INCOME TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, ACCOUNTING FOR INTEREST AND PENALTIES ASSOCIATED WITH TAX

POSITIONS, AND INCOME TAX DISCLOSURES. JUDGMENT IS REQUIRED IN ASSESSING THE FUTURE TAX CONSEQUENCES OF EVENTS THAT HAVE BEEN RECOGNIZED IN OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OR TAX RETURNS. VARIATIONS IN THE ACTUAL OUTCOME OF THESE FUTURE TAX

CONSEQUENCES COULD MATERIALLY IMPACT OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

INVENTORIES

INVENTORIES ARE STATED AT AVERAGE COST, SUBJECT TO THE LOWER OF COST OR MARKET. COST INCLUDES MATERIALS, LABOR, AND MANUFACTURING OVERHEAD RELATED TO THE PURCHASE AND PRODUCTION OF INVENTORIES. WE REGULARLY REVIEW

INVENTORY QUANTITIES ON HAND, FUTURE PURCHASE COMMITMENTS WITH OUR SUPPLIERS, AND THE ESTIMATED UTILITY OF OUR INVENTORY. THESE REVIEWS INCLUDE ANALYSIS OF DEMAND FORECASTS, PRODUCT LIFE CYCLE STATUS, PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT PLANS, CURRENT SALES LEVELS,

PRICING STRATEGY, AND COMPONENT COST TRENDS. IF OUR REVIEW INDICATES A REDUCTION IN UTILITY BELOW CARRYING VALUE, WE REDUCE OUR INVENTORY TO A NEW COST BASIS THROUGH A CHARGE TO COST OF REVENUE. THE DETERMINATION OF MARKET VALUE AND THE ESTIMATED

VOLUME OF DEMAND USED IN THE LOWER OF COST OR MARKET ANALYSIS REQUIRE SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT.

ITEM 7A

ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT

MARKET RISK

RISKS

WE ARE EXPOSED TO ECONOMIC RISK FROM FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES, INTEREST RATES, CREDIT RISK, EQUITY PRICES, AND COMMODITY PRICES. A PORTION OF THESE RISKS IS HEDGED, BUT THEY MAY IMPACT OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS.

FOREIGN CURRENCY

CERTAIN FORECASTED TRANSACTIONS, ASSETS, AND LIABILITIES ARE EXPOSED TO FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK. WE MONITOR OUR FOREIGN CURRENCY EXPOSURES DAILY AND

USE HEDGES WHERE PRACTICABLE TO OFFSET THE RISKS AND MAXIMIZE THE ECONOMIC EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR FOREIGN CURRENCY POSITIONS. PRINCIPAL CURRENCIES HEDGED INCLUDE THE EURO, JAPANESE YEN, BRITISH POUND, CANADIAN DOLLAR, AND AUSTRALIAN DOLLAR.

INTEREST RATE

OUR FIXED-INCOME

PORTFOLIO IS DIVERSIFIED ACROSS CREDIT SECTORS AND MATURITIES, CONSISTING PRIMARILY OF INVESTMENT-GRADE SECURITIES. THE CREDIT RISK AND AVERAGE MATURITY OF THE FIXED-INCOME PORTFOLIO IS MANAGED TO ACHIEVE ECONOMIC RETURNS THAT CORRELATE TO CERTAIN

GLOBAL AND DOMESTIC FIXED-INCOME INDICES. IN ADDITION, WE USE TO BE ANNOUNCED FORWARD PURCHASE COMMITMENTS OF MORTGAGE-BACKED ASSETS TO GAIN EXPOSURE TO AGENCY MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES.

EQUITY

OUR EQUITY PORTFOLIO CONSISTS OF

GLOBAL, DEVELOPED, AND EMERGING MARKET SECURITIES THAT ARE SUBJECT TO MARKET PRICE RISK. WE MANAGE THE SECURITIES RELATIVE TO CERTAIN GLOBAL AND DOMESTIC INDICES AND EXPECT THEIR ECONOMIC RISK AND RETURN TO CORRELATE WITH THESE INDICES.

COMMODITY

WE USE BROAD-BASED

COMMODITY EXPOSURES TO ENHANCE PORTFOLIO RETURNS AND FACILITATE PORTFOLIO DIVERSIFICATION. OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO HAS EXPOSURE TO A VARIETY OF COMMODITIES, INCLUDING PRECIOUS METALS, ENERGY, AND GRAIN. WE MANAGE THESE EXPOSURES RELATIVE TO GLOBAL

COMMODITY INDICES AND EXPECT THEIR ECONOMIC RISK AND RETURN TO CORRELATE WITH THESE INDICES.

VALUE-AT-RISK

WE USE A VALUE-AT-RISK (VAR) MODEL TO ESTIMATE AND QUANTIFY OUR MARKET RISKS. VAR IS THE EXPECTED LOSS, FOR A GIVEN CONFIDENCE LEVEL,

IN THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR PORTFOLIO DUE TO ADVERSE MARKET MOVEMENTS OVER A DEFINED TIME HORIZON. THE VAR MODEL IS NOT INTENDED TO REPRESENT ACTUAL LOSSES IN FAIR VALUE, INCLUDING DETERMINATIONS OF OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY LOSSES IN FAIR VALUE IN

ACCORDANCE WITH U.S. GAAP, BUT IS USED AS A RISK ESTIMATION AND MANAGEMENT TOOL. THE DISTRIBUTION OF THE POTENTIAL CHANGES IN TOTAL MARKET VALUE OF ALL HOLDINGS IS COMPUTED BASED ON THE HISTORICAL VOLATILITIES AND CORRELATIONS AMONG FOREIGN EXCHANGE

RATES, INTEREST RATES, EQUITY PRICES, AND COMMODITY PRICES, ASSUMING NORMAL MARKET CONDITIONS.

THE VAR IS CALCULATED AS THE TOTAL LOSS

THAT WILL NOT BE EXCEEDED AT THE 97.5 PERCENTILE CONFIDENCE LEVEL OR, ALTERNATIVELY STATED, THE LOSSES COULD EXCEED THE VAR IN 25 OUT OF 1,000 CASES. SEVERAL RISK FACTORS ARE NOT CAPTURED IN THE MODEL, INCLUDING LIQUIDITY RISK, OPERATIONAL RISK, AND

LEGAL RISK.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 1  ACCOUNTING POLICIES

ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES

THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND ACCOMPANYING NOTES ARE PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED

STATES OF AMERICA (U.S. GAAP).

WE HAVE RECAST CERTAIN PRIOR PERIOD AMOUNTS TO CONFORM TO THE CURRENT PERIOD PRESENTATION,

WITH NO IMPACT ON CONSOLIDATED NET INCOME OR CASH FLOWS.

PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION

THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDE THE ACCOUNTS OF MICROSOFT CORPORATION AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES. INTERCOMPANY TRANSACTIONS AND BALANCES

HAVE BEEN ELIMINATED. EQUITY INVESTMENTS THROUGH WHICH WE ARE ABLE TO EXERCISE SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE OVER BUT DO NOT CONTROL THE INVESTEE AND ARE NOT THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY OF THE INVESTEES ACTIVITIES ARE ACCOUNTED FOR USING THE EQUITY

METHOD. INVESTMENTS THROUGH WHICH WE ARE NOT ABLE TO EXERCISE SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE OVER THE INVESTEE AND WHICH DO NOT HAVE READILY DETERMINABLE FAIR VALUES ARE ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER THE COST METHOD.

ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS

PREPARING

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS, LIABILITIES, REVENUE, AND EXPENSES. EXAMPLES OF ESTIMATES INCLUDE: LOSS CONTINGENCIES; PRODUCT WARRANTIES; THE FAIR VALUE OF,

AND/OR POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT OF GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLES ASSETS, FOR OUR REPORTING UNITS; PRODUCT LIFE CYCLES; USEFUL LIVES OF OUR TANGIBLE AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS; ALLOWANCES FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS; ALLOWANCES FOR PRODUCT RETURNS; THE MARKET VALUE OF

OUR INVENTORY; AND STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION FORFEITURE RATES. EXAMPLES OF ASSUMPTIONS INCLUDE: THE ELEMENTS COMPRISING A SOFTWARE ARRANGEMENT, INCLUDING THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN UPGRADES OR ENHANCEMENTS AND NEW PRODUCTS; WHEN TECHNOLOGICAL

FEASIBILITY IS ACHIEVED FOR OUR PRODUCTS; THE POTENTIAL OUTCOME OF FUTURE TAX CONSEQUENCES OF EVENTS THAT HAVE BEEN RECOGNIZED IN OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OR TAX RETURNS; AND DETERMINING WHEN INVESTMENT IMPAIRMENTS ARE

OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY. ACTUAL RESULTS AND OUTCOMES MAY DIFFER FROM MANAGEMENTS ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS.

FOREIGN CURRENCIES

ASSETS AND LIABILITIES RECORDED IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES ARE TRANSLATED AT THE EXCHANGE RATE ON THE BALANCE SHEET DATE. REVENUE AND EXPENSES ARE

TRANSLATED AT AVERAGE RATES OF EXCHANGE PREVAILING DURING THE YEAR. TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENTS RESULTING FROM THIS PROCESS ARE RECORDED TO OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (OCI).

REVENUE RECOGNITION

REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED WHEN PERSUASIVE EVIDENCE OF AN ARRANGEMENT EXISTS,

DELIVERY HAS OCCURRED, THE FEE IS FIXED OR DETERMINABLE, AND COLLECTABILITY IS PROBABLE. REVENUE GENERALLY IS RECOGNIZED NET OF ALLOWANCES FOR RETURNS AND ANY TAXES COLLECTED FROM CUSTOMERS AND SUBSEQUENTLY REMITTED TO GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORITIES.

REVENUE RECOGNITION FOR MULTIPLE-ELEMENT ARRANGEMENTS REQUIRES JUDGMENT TO DETERMINE IF MULTIPLE ELEMENTS EXIST, WHETHER ELEMENTS CAN

BE ACCOUNTED FOR AS SEPARATE UNITS OF ACCOUNTING, AND IF SO, THE FAIR VALUE FOR EACH OF THE ELEMENTS.

MICROSOFT ENTERS INTO

ARRANGEMENTS THAT CAN INCLUDE VARIOUS COMBINATIONS OF SOFTWARE, SERVICES, AND HARDWARE. WHERE ELEMENTS ARE DELIVERED OVER DIFFERENT PERIODS OF TIME, AND WHEN ALLOWED UNDER U.S. GAAP, REVENUE IS ALLOCATED TO THE RESPECTIVE ELEMENTS BASED ON THEIR

RELATIVE SELLING PRICES AT THE INCEPTION OF THE ARRANGEMENT, AND REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED AS EACH ELEMENT IS DELIVERED. WE USE A HIERARCHY TO DETERMINE THE FAIR VALUE TO BE USED FOR ALLOCATING REVENUE TO ELEMENTS: (I) VENDOR-SPECIFIC OBJECTIVE

EVIDENCE OF FAIR VALUE (VSOE), (II) THIRD-PARTY EVIDENCE,

58

TABLE OF CONTENTS

PART II

ITEM 8

AND (III) BEST ESTIMATE OF SELLING PRICE (ESP). FOR SOFTWARE ELEMENTS, WE FOLLOW THE INDUSTRY SPECIFIC SOFTWARE GUIDANCE WHICH ONLY ALLOWS FOR THE USE OF VSOE IN ESTABLISHING

FAIR VALUE. GENERALLY, VSOE IS THE PRICE CHARGED WHEN THE DELIVERABLE IS SOLD SEPARATELY OR THE PRICE ESTABLISHED BY MANAGEMENT FOR A PRODUCT THAT IS NOT YET SOLD IF IT IS PROBABLE THAT THE PRICE WILL NOT CHANGE BEFORE INTRODUCTION INTO THE

MARKETPLACE. ESPS ARE ESTABLISHED AS BEST ESTIMATES OF WHAT THE SELLING PRICES WOULD BE IF THE DELIVERABLES WERE SOLD REGULARLY ON A STAND-ALONE BASIS. OUR PROCESS FOR DETERMINING ESPS REQUIRES JUDGMENT AND CONSIDERS MULTIPLE FACTORS THAT MAY VARY

OVER TIME DEPENDING UPON THE UNIQUE FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES RELATED TO EACH DELIVERABLE.

REVENUE FOR RETAIL PACKAGED PRODUCTS, PRODUCTS

LICENSED TO ORIGINAL EQUIPMENT MANUFACTURERS (OEMS), AND PERPETUAL LICENSES UNDER CERTAIN VOLUME LICENSING PROGRAMS GENERALLY IS RECOGNIZED AS PRODUCTS ARE SHIPPED OR MADE AVAILABLE.

TECHNOLOGY GUARANTEE PROGRAMS ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AS MULTIPLE-ELEMENT ARRANGEMENTS AS CUSTOMERS RECEIVE FREE OR SIGNIFICANTLY DISCOUNTED RIGHTS TO

USE UPCOMING NEW VERSIONS OF A SOFTWARE PRODUCT IF THEY LICENSE EXISTING VERSIONS OF THE PRODUCT DURING THE ELIGIBILITY PERIOD. REVENUE IS ALLOCATED BETWEEN THE EXISTING PRODUCT AND THE NEW PRODUCT, AND REVENUE ALLOCATED TO THE NEW PRODUCT IS

DEFERRED UNTIL THAT VERSION IS DELIVERED. THE REVENUE ALLOCATION IS BASED ON THE VSOE OF FAIR VALUE OF THE PRODUCTS. THE VSOE OF FAIR VALUE FOR UPCOMING NEW PRODUCTS ARE BASED ON THE PRICE DETERMINED BY MANAGEMENT HAVING THE RELEVANT AUTHORITY WHEN

THE ELEMENT IS NOT YET SOLD SEPARATELY, BUT IS EXPECTED TO BE SOLD IN THE NEAR FUTURE AT THE PRICE SET BY MANAGEMENT.

SOFTWARE UPDATES

THAT WILL BE PROVIDED FREE OF CHARGE ARE EVALUATED ON A CASE-BY-CASE BASIS TO DETERMINE WHETHER THEY MEET THE DEFINITION OF AN UPGRADE AND CREATE A MULTIPLE-ELEMENT ARRANGEMENT, WHICH MAY REQUIRE REVENUE TO BE DEFERRED AND RECOGNIZED WHEN THE

UPGRADE IS DELIVERED, OR IF IT IS DETERMINED THAT IMPLIED POST-CONTRACT CUSTOMER SUPPORT (PCS) IS BEING PROVIDED, THE ARRANGEMENT IS ACCOUNTED FOR AS A MULTIPLE-ELEMENT ARRANGEMENT AND ALL REVENUE FROM THE ARRANGEMENT IS DEFERRED AND

RECOGNIZED OVER THE IMPLIED PCS TERM WHEN THE VSOE OF FAIR VALUE DOES NOT EXIST. IF UPDATES ARE DETERMINED TO NOT MEET THE DEFINITION OF AN UPGRADE, REVENUE IS GENERALLY RECOGNIZED AS PRODUCTS ARE SHIPPED OR MADE AVAILABLE.

CERTAIN VOLUME LICENSING ARRANGEMENTS INCLUDE A PERPETUAL LICENSE FOR CURRENT PRODUCTS COMBINED WITH RIGHTS TO RECEIVE UNSPECIFIED FUTURE VERSIONS

OF SOFTWARE PRODUCTS, WHICH WE HAVE DETERMINED ARE ADDITIONAL SOFTWARE PRODUCTS AND ARE THEREFORE ACCOUNTED FOR AS SUBSCRIPTIONS, WITH BILLINGS RECORDED AS UNEARNED REVENUE AND RECOGNIZED AS REVENUE RATABLY OVER THE COVERAGE PERIOD. ARRANGEMENTS

THAT INCLUDE TERM-BASED LICENSES FOR CURRENT PRODUCTS WITH THE RIGHT TO USE UNSPECIFIED FUTURE VERSIONS OF THE SOFTWARE DURING THE COVERAGE PERIOD, ARE ALSO ACCOUNTED FOR AS SUBSCRIPTIONS, WITH REVENUE RECOGNIZED RATABLY OVER THE COVERAGE PERIOD.

REVENUE FROM CLOUD-BASED SERVICES ARRANGEMENTS THAT ALLOW FOR THE USE OF A HOSTED SOFTWARE PRODUCT OR SERVICE OVER A CONTRACTUALLY

DETERMINED PERIOD OF TIME WITHOUT TAKING POSSESSION OF SOFTWARE ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AS SUBSCRIPTIONS WITH BILLINGS RECORDED AS UNEARNED REVENUE AND RECOGNIZED AS REVENUE RATABLY OVER THE COVERAGE PERIOD BEGINNING ON THE DATE THE SERVICE IS MADE

AVAILABLE TO CUSTOMERS. REVENUE FROM CLOUD-BASED SERVICES ARRANGEMENTS THAT ARE PROVIDED ON A CONSUMPTION BASIS (FOR EXAMPLE, THE AMOUNT OF STORAGE USED IN A PARTICULAR PERIOD) IS RECOGNIZED COMMENSURATE WITH THE CUSTOMER UTILIZATION OF SUCH

RESOURCES.

SOME VOLUME LICENSING ARRANGEMENTS INCLUDE TIME-BASED SUBSCRIPTIONS FOR CLOUD-BASED SERVICES AND SOFTWARE OFFERINGS THAT ARE

ACCOUNTED FOR AS SUBSCRIPTIONS. THESE ARRANGEMENTS ARE CONSIDERED MULTIPLE-ELEMENT ARRANGEMENTS. HOWEVER, BECAUSE ALL ELEMENTS ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AS SUBSCRIPTIONS AND HAVE THE SAME COVERAGE PERIOD AND DELIVERY PATTERN, THEY HAVE THE SAME REVENUE

RECOGNITION TIMING.

REVENUE RELATED TO PHONES, SURFACE DEVICES, XBOX CONSOLES, GAMES PUBLISHED BY US, AND OTHER HARDWARE COMPONENTS IS

GENERALLY RECOGNIZED WHEN OWNERSHIP IS TRANSFERRED TO THE RESELLERS OR TO END CUSTOMERS WHEN SELLING DIRECTLY THROUGH MICROSOFT RETAIL STORES AND ONLINE MARKETPLACES. A PORTION OF REVENUE MAY BE DEFERRED WHEN THESE PRODUCTS ARE COMBINED WITH

SOFTWARE ELEMENTS, AND/OR SERVICES. REVENUE RELATED TO LICENSING FOR GAMES PUBLISHED BY THIRD PARTIES FOR USE ON THE XBOX CONSOLES IS RECOGNIZED WHEN GAMES ARE MANUFACTURED BY THE GAME PUBLISHERS.

DISPLAY ADVERTISING REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED AS ADVERTISEMENTS ARE DISPLAYED. SEARCH ADVERTISING REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED WHEN THE AD APPEARS IN THE

SEARCH RESULTS OR WHEN THE ACTION NECESSARY TO EARN THE REVENUE HAS BEEN

COMPLETED. CONSULTING SERVICES REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED AS SERVICES ARE RENDERED, GENERALLY BASED ON THE NEGOTIATED HOURLY RATE IN THE CONSULTING ARRANGEMENT AND THE NUMBER OF HOURS WORKED DURING

THE PERIOD. CONSULTING REVENUE FOR FIXED-PRICE SERVICES ARRANGEMENTS IS RECOGNIZED AS SERVICES ARE PROVIDED. REVENUE FROM PREPAID POINTS REDEEMABLE FOR THE PURCHASE OF SOFTWARE OR SERVICES IS RECOGNIZED UPON REDEMPTION OF THE POINTS AND DELIVERY OF

THE SOFTWARE OR SERVICES.

COST OF REVENUE

COST OF REVENUE INCLUDES: MANUFACTURING AND DISTRIBUTION COSTS FOR PRODUCTS SOLD AND PROGRAMS LICENSED; OPERATING COSTS RELATED TO PRODUCT SUPPORT SERVICE CENTERS AND PRODUCT DISTRIBUTION CENTERS; COSTS INCURRED TO

INCLUDE SOFTWARE ON PCS SOLD BY OEMS, TO DRIVE TRAFFIC TO OUR WEBSITES, AND TO ACQUIRE ONLINE ADVERTISING SPACE; COSTS INCURRED TO SUPPORT AND MAINTAIN INTERNET-BASED PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, INCLUDING DATACENTER COSTS AND ROYALTIES; WARRANTY COSTS;

INVENTORY VALUATION ADJUSTMENTS; COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE DELIVERY OF CONSULTING SERVICES; AND THE AMORTIZATION OF CAPITALIZED SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT COSTS. CAPITALIZED SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT COSTS ARE AMORTIZED OVER THE ESTIMATED LIVES OF THE

PRODUCTS.

PRODUCT WARRANTY

WE

PROVIDE FOR THE ESTIMATED COSTS OF FULFILLING OUR OBLIGATIONS UNDER HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE WARRANTIES AT THE TIME THE RELATED REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED. FOR HARDWARE WARRANTIES, WE ESTIMATE THE COSTS BASED ON HISTORICAL AND PROJECTED PRODUCT FAILURE

RATES, HISTORICAL AND PROJECTED REPAIR COSTS, AND KNOWLEDGE OF SPECIFIC PRODUCT FAILURES (IF ANY). THE SPECIFIC HARDWARE WARRANTY TERMS AND CONDITIONS VARY DEPENDING UPON THE PRODUCT SOLD AND THE COUNTRY IN WHICH WE DO BUSINESS, BUT GENERALLY

INCLUDE PARTS AND LABOR OVER A PERIOD GENERALLY RANGING FROM 90 DAYS TO THREE YEARS. FOR SOFTWARE WARRANTIES, WE ESTIMATE THE COSTS TO PROVIDE BUG FIXES, SUCH AS SECURITY PATCHES, OVER THE ESTIMATED LIFE OF THE SOFTWARE. WE REGULARLY REEVALUATE

OUR ESTIMATES TO ASSESS THE ADEQUACY OF THE RECORDED WARRANTY LIABILITIES AND ADJUST THE AMOUNTS AS NECESSARY.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES INCLUDE PAYROLL, EMPLOYEE BENEFITS, STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE, AND OTHER HEADCOUNT-RELATED

EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT. RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES ALSO INCLUDE THIRD-PARTY DEVELOPMENT AND PROGRAMMING COSTS, LOCALIZATION COSTS INCURRED TO TRANSLATE SOFTWARE FOR INTERNATIONAL MARKETS, AND THE AMORTIZATION OF

PURCHASED SOFTWARE CODE AND SERVICES CONTENT. SUCH COSTS RELATED TO SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT ARE INCLUDED IN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSE UNTIL THE POINT THAT TECHNOLOGICAL FEASIBILITY IS REACHED, WHICH FOR OUR SOFTWARE PRODUCTS, IS GENERALLY

SHORTLY BEFORE THE PRODUCTS ARE RELEASED TO MANUFACTURING. ONCE TECHNOLOGICAL FEASIBILITY IS REACHED, SUCH COSTS ARE CAPITALIZED AND AMORTIZED TO COST OF REVENUE OVER THE ESTIMATED LIVES OF THE PRODUCTS.

SALES AND MARKETING

SALES AND MARKETING

EXPENSES INCLUDE PAYROLL, EMPLOYEE BENEFITS, STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE, AND OTHER HEADCOUNT-RELATED EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH SALES AND MARKETING PERSONNEL, AND THE COSTS OF ADVERTISING, PROMOTIONS, TRADE SHOWS, SEMINARS, AND OTHER PROGRAMS.

ADVERTISING COSTS ARE EXPENSED AS INCURRED. ADVERTISING EXPENSE WAS $1.9 BILLION, $2.3 BILLION, AND $2.6 BILLION IN FISCAL YEARS 2015, 2014, AND 2013, RESPECTIVELY.

STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION

WE MEASURE STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION COST AT THE GRANT DATE BASED ON

THE FAIR VALUE OF THE AWARD AND RECOGNIZE IT AS EXPENSE, NET OF ESTIMATED FORFEITURES, OVER THE VESTING OR SERVICE PERIOD, AS APPLICABLE, OF THE STOCK AWARD (GENERALLY FOUR TO FIVE YEARS) USING THE STRAIGHT-LINE METHOD.

EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN

SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK MAY BE PURCHASED BY EMPLOYEES AT THREE-MONTH INTERVALS AT 90% OF THE FAIR MARKET VALUE OF THE STOCK ON THE LAST DAY OF EACH THREE-MONTH PERIOD. COMPENSATION EXPENSE FOR THE EMPLOYEE STOCK

PURCHASE PLAN IS MEASURED AS THE DISCOUNT THE EMPLOYEE IS ENTITLED TO UPON PURCHASE AND IS RECOGNIZED IN THE PERIOD OF PURCHASE.

INCOME TAXES

INCOME TAX EXPENSE INCLUDES U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL INCOME TAXES, THE PROVISION FOR U.S. TAXES ON UNDISTRIBUTED EARNINGS OF

INTERNATIONAL SUBSIDIARIES NOT DEEMED TO BE PERMANENTLY INVESTED, AND INTEREST AND PENALTIES ON UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS. CERTAIN INCOME AND EXPENSES ARE NOT REPORTED IN TAX RETURNS AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN THE SAME YEAR. THE TAX EFFECT OF SUCH

TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES IS REPORTED AS DEFERRED INCOME TAXES. DEFERRED TAX ASSETS ARE REPORTED NET OF A VALUATION ALLOWANCE WHEN IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT A TAX BENEFIT WILL NOT BE REALIZED. THE DEFERRED INCOME TAXES ARE CLASSIFIED AS CURRENT OR

LONG-TERM BASED ON THE CLASSIFICATION OF THE RELATED ASSET OR LIABILITY.

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

WE ACCOUNT FOR CERTAIN ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AT FAIR VALUE. THE HIERARCHY BELOW LISTS THREE LEVELS OF FAIR VALUE BASED ON THE EXTENT TO WHICH

INPUTS USED IN MEASURING FAIR VALUE ARE OBSERVABLE IN THE MARKET. WE CATEGORIZE EACH OF OUR FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS IN ONE OF THESE THREE LEVELS BASED ON THE LOWEST LEVEL INPUT THAT IS SIGNIFICANT TO THE FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT IN ITS ENTIRETY.

THESE LEVELS ARE.



LEVEL 1

 INPUTS ARE BASED UPON UNADJUSTED QUOTED PRICES FOR IDENTICAL INSTRUMENTS TRADED IN ACTIVE MARKETS. OUR LEVEL 1 NON-DERIVATIVE

INVESTMENTS PRIMARILY INCLUDE U.S. GOVERNMENT SECURITIES, DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL EQUITIES, AND ACTIVELY TRADED MUTUAL FUNDS. OUR LEVEL 1 DERIVATIVE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES INCLUDE THOSE ACTIVELY TRADED ON EXCHANGES.



LEVEL 2

 INPUTS ARE BASED UPON QUOTED PRICES FOR SIMILAR INSTRUMENTS IN ACTIVE MARKETS, QUOTED PRICES FOR IDENTICAL OR SIMILAR INSTRUMENTS IN

MARKETS THAT ARE NOT ACTIVE, AND MODEL-BASED VALUATION TECHNIQUES (E.G. THE BLACK-SCHOLES MODEL) FOR WHICH ALL SIGNIFICANT INPUTS ARE OBSERVABLE IN THE MARKET OR CAN BE CORROBORATED BY OBSERVABLE MARKET DATA FOR SUBSTANTIALLY THE FULL TERM OF THE

ASSETS OR LIABILITIES. WHERE APPLICABLE, THESE MODELS PROJECT FUTURE CASH FLOWS AND DISCOUNT THE FUTURE AMOUNTS TO A PRESENT VALUE USING MARKET-BASED OBSERVABLE INPUTS INCLUDING INTEREST RATE CURVES, CREDIT SPREADS, FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES, AND

FORWARD AND SPOT PRICES FOR CURRENCIES AND COMMODITIES. OUR LEVEL 2 NON-DERIVATIVE INVESTMENTS CONSIST PRIMARILY OF CORPORATE NOTES AND BONDS, COMMON AND PREFERRED STOCK, MORTGAGE- AND ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES, U.S. GOVERNMENT AND AGENCY SECURITIES,

AND FOREIGN GOVERNMENT BONDS. OUR LEVEL 2 DERIVATIVE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES PRIMARILY INCLUDE CERTAIN OVER-THE-COUNTER OPTION AND SWAP CONTRACTS.



LEVEL 3

 INPUTS ARE GENERALLY UNOBSERVABLE AND TYPICALLY REFLECT MANAGEMENTS ESTIMATES OF ASSUMPTIONS THAT MARKET PARTICIPANTS WOULD USE IN

PRICING THE ASSET OR LIABILITY. THE FAIR VALUES ARE THEREFORE DETERMINED USING MODEL-BASED TECHNIQUES, INCLUDING OPTION PRICING MODELS AND DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW MODELS. OUR LEVEL 3 NON-DERIVATIVE ASSETS PRIMARILY COMPRISE INVESTMENTS IN COMMON AND

PREFERRED STOCK AND GOODWILL WHEN IT IS RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE DUE TO AN IMPAIRMENT CHARGE. UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS USED IN THE MODELS ARE SIGNIFICANT TO THE FAIR VALUES OF THE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. OUR LEVEL 3 DERIVATIVE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES

PRIMARILY INCLUDE EQUITY DERIVATIVES.

WE MEASURE CERTAIN ASSETS, INCLUDING OUR COST AND EQUITY METHOD INVESTMENTS, AT

FAIR VALUE ON A NONRECURRING BASIS WHEN THEY ARE DEEMED TO BE OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARILY IMPAIRED. THE FAIR VALUES OF THESE INVESTMENTS ARE DETERMINED BASED ON VALUATION TECHNIQUES USING THE BEST INFORMATION AVAILABLE, AND MAY INCLUDE QUOTED MARKET

PRICES, MARKET COMPARABLES, AND DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW PROJECTIONS. AN IMPAIRMENT CHARGE IS RECORDED WHEN THE COST OF THE INVESTMENT EXCEEDS ITS FAIR VALUE AND THIS CONDITION IS DETERMINED TO BE OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY.

OUR OTHER CURRENT FINANCIAL ASSETS AND OUR CURRENT FINANCIAL LIABILITIES HAVE FAIR VALUES THAT APPROXIMATE THEIR CARRYING VALUES.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

WE CONSIDER ALL HIGHLY LIQUID INTEREST-EARNING INVESTMENTS WITH A MATURITY OF THREE MONTHS OR LESS AT THE DATE OF PURCHASE TO BE CASH EQUIVALENTS. THE FAIR VALUES OF THESE INVESTMENTS APPROXIMATE THEIR CARRYING

VALUES. IN GENERAL, INVESTMENTS WITH ORIGINAL MATURITIES OF GREATER THAN THREE MONTHS AND REMAINING MATURITIES OF LESS THAN ONE YEAR ARE CLASSIFIED AS SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS. INVESTMENTS WITH MATURITIES BEYOND ONE YEAR MAY BE CLASSIFIED AS

SHORT-TERM BASED ON THEIR HIGHLY LIQUID NATURE AND BECAUSE SUCH MARKETABLE SECURITIES REPRESENT THE INVESTMENT OF CASH THAT IS AVAILABLE FOR CURRENT OPERATIONS. ALL CASH EQUIVALENTS AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS ARE CLASSIFIED AS AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE AND

REALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES ARE RECORDED USING THE SPECIFIC IDENTIFICATION METHOD. CHANGES IN MARKET VALUE, EXCLUDING OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENTS, ARE REFLECTED IN OCI.

EQUITY AND OTHER INVESTMENTS CLASSIFIED AS LONG-TERM INCLUDE BOTH DEBT AND EQUITY INSTRUMENTS. WITH THE EXCEPTION OF CERTAIN CORPORATE NOTES THAT ARE CLASSIFIED AS HELD-TO-MATURITY, DEBT AND PUBLICLY-TRADED EQUITY

SECURITIES ARE CLASSIFIED AS AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE AND REALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES ARE RECORDED USING THE SPECIFIC IDENTIFICATION METHOD. CHANGES IN THE MARKET VALUE OF AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE SECURITIES, EXCLUDING OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENTS, ARE

REFLECTED IN OCI. HELD-TO-MATURITY INVESTMENTS ARE RECORDED AND HELD AT AMORTIZED COST. COMMON AND PREFERRED STOCK AND OTHER INVESTMENTS THAT ARE RESTRICTED FOR MORE THAN ONE YEAR OR ARE NOT PUBLICLY TRADED ARE RECORDED AT COST OR USING THE EQUITY

METHOD.

WE LEND CERTAIN FIXED-INCOME AND EQUITY SECURITIES TO INCREASE INVESTMENT RETURNS. THE LOANED SECURITIES CONTINUE TO BE CARRIED

AS INVESTMENTS ON OUR BALANCE SHEET. CASH AND/OR SECURITY INTERESTS ARE RECEIVED AS COLLATERAL FOR THE LOANED SECURITIES WITH THE AMOUNT DETERMINED BASED UPON THE UNDERLYING SECURITY LENT AND THE CREDITWORTHINESS OF THE BORROWER. CASH RECEIVED IS

RECORDED AS AN ASSET WITH A CORRESPONDING LIABILITY.

INVESTMENTS ARE CONSIDERED TO BE IMPAIRED WHEN A DECLINE IN FAIR VALUE IS JUDGED

TO BE OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY. FAIR VALUE IS CALCULATED BASED ON PUBLICLY AVAILABLE MARKET INFORMATION OR OTHER ESTIMATES DETERMINED BY MANAGEMENT. WE EMPLOY A SYSTEMATIC METHODOLOGY ON A QUARTERLY BASIS THAT CONSIDERS AVAILABLE QUANTITATIVE AND

QUALITATIVE EVIDENCE IN EVALUATING POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT OF OUR INVESTMENTS. IF THE COST OF AN INVESTMENT EXCEEDS ITS FAIR VALUE, WE EVALUATE, AMONG OTHER FACTORS, GENERAL MARKET CONDITIONS, CREDIT QUALITY OF DEBT INSTRUMENT ISSUERS, THE DURATION AND

EXTENT TO WHICH THE FAIR VALUE IS LESS THAN COST, AND FOR EQUITY SECURITIES, OUR INTENT AND ABILITY TO HOLD, OR PLANS TO SELL, THE INVESTMENT. FOR FIXED-INCOME SECURITIES, WE ALSO EVALUATE WHETHER WE HAVE PLANS TO SELL THE SECURITY OR IT IS MORE

LIKELY THAN NOT THAT WE WILL BE REQUIRED TO SELL THE SECURITY BEFORE RECOVERY. WE ALSO CONSIDER SPECIFIC ADVERSE CONDITIONS RELATED TO THE FINANCIAL HEALTH OF AND BUSINESS OUTLOOK FOR THE INVESTEE, INCLUDING INDUSTRY AND SECTOR PERFORMANCE, CHANGES

IN TECHNOLOGY, AND OPERATIONAL AND FINANCING CASH FLOW FACTORS. ONCE A DECLINE IN FAIR VALUE IS DETERMINED TO BE OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY, AN IMPAIRMENT CHARGE IS RECORDED TO OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE), NET AND A NEW COST BASIS IN THE INVESTMENT IS

ESTABLISHED.

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS ARE RECOGNIZED AS EITHER ASSETS OR LIABILITIES AND ARE MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE. THE ACCOUNTING FOR

CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF A DERIVATIVE DEPENDS ON THE INTENDED USE OF THE DERIVATIVE AND THE RESULTING DESIGNATION.

FOR DERIVATIVE

INSTRUMENTS DESIGNATED AS FAIR VALUE HEDGES, THE GAINS (LOSSES) ARE RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS IN THE PERIODS OF CHANGE TOGETHER WITH THE OFFSETTING LOSSES (GAINS) ON THE HEDGED ITEMS ATTRIBUTED TO THE RISK BEING HEDGED. FOR OPTIONS DESIGNATED AS FAIR

VALUE HEDGES, CHANGES IN THE TIME VALUE ARE EXCLUDED FROM THE ASSESSMENT OF HEDGE EFFECTIVENESS AND ARE RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS.

FOR

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS DESIGNATED AS CASH-FLOW HEDGES, THE EFFECTIVE PORTION OF THE GAINS (LOSSES) ON THE DERIVATIVES IS INITIALLY REPORTED AS A COMPONENT OF OCI AND IS SUBSEQUENTLY RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS WHEN THE HEDGED EXPOSURE IS RECOGNIZED IN

EARNINGS. FOR OPTIONS DESIGNATED AS CASH-FLOW HEDGES, CHANGES IN THE TIME VALUE ARE EXCLUDED FROM THE ASSESSMENT OF HEDGE EFFECTIVENESS AND ARE RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS. GAINS (LOSSES) ON DERIVATIVES REPRESENTING EITHER HEDGE COMPONENTS EXCLUDED FROM

THE ASSESSMENT OF EFFECTIVENESS OR HEDGE INEFFECTIVENESS ARE RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS.

FOR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS THAT ARE NOT DESIGNATED

AS HEDGES, GAINS (LOSSES) FROM CHANGES IN FAIR VALUES ARE PRIMARILY RECOGNIZED IN OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE), NET. OTHER THAN THOSE DERIVATIVES ENTERED INTO FOR INVESTMENT

PURPOSES, SUCH AS COMMODITY CONTRACTS, THE GAINS (LOSSES) ARE GENERALLY ECONOMICALLY OFFSET BY UNREALIZED GAINS (LOSSES) IN THE UNDERLYING AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE SECURITIES, WHICH ARE RECORDED AS A

COMPONENT OF OCI UNTIL THE SECURITIES ARE SOLD OR OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARILY IMPAIRED, AT WHICH TIME THE AMOUNTS ARE RECLASSIFIED FROM ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (AOCI) INTO OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE), NET.

ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS

THE

ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS REFLECTS OUR BEST ESTIMATE OF PROBABLE LOSSES INHERENT IN THE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE BALANCE. WE DETERMINE THE ALLOWANCE BASED ON KNOWN TROUBLED ACCOUNTS, HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE, AND OTHER CURRENTLY AVAILABLE EVIDENCE.

INVENTORIES

INVENTORIES ARE STATED AT AVERAGE COST, SUBJECT TO THE LOWER OF COST OR MARKET. COST INCLUDES MATERIALS, LABOR, AND MANUFACTURING OVERHEAD RELATED

TO THE PURCHASE AND PRODUCTION OF INVENTORIES. WE REGULARLY REVIEW INVENTORY QUANTITIES ON HAND, FUTURE PURCHASE COMMITMENTS WITH OUR SUPPLIERS, AND THE ESTIMATED UTILITY OF OUR INVENTORY. IF OUR REVIEW INDICATES A REDUCTION IN UTILITY BELOW

CARRYING VALUE, WE REDUCE OUR INVENTORY TO A NEW COST BASIS THROUGH A CHARGE TO COST OF REVENUE. THE DETERMINATION OF MARKET VALUE AND THE ESTIMATED VOLUME OF DEMAND USED IN THE LOWER OF COST OR MARKET ANALYSIS REQUIRE SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT.

PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT

PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT IS STATED AT COST AND DEPRECIATED USING THE STRAIGHT-LINE METHOD OVER THE SHORTER OF THE ESTIMATED USEFUL LIFE OF THE ASSET

OR THE LEASE TERM. THE ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES OF OUR PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT ARE GENERALLY AS FOLLOWS: COMPUTER SOFTWARE DEVELOPED OR ACQUIRED FOR INTERNAL USE, THREE TO SEVEN YEARS; COMPUTER EQUIPMENT, TWO TO THREE YEARS; BUILDINGS AND IMPROVEMENTS,

FIVE TO 15 YEARS; LEASEHOLD IMPROVEMENTS, THREE TO 20 YEARS; AND FURNITURE AND EQUIPMENT, ONE TO 10 YEARS. LAND IS NOT DEPRECIATED.

GOODWILL

GOODWILL IS TESTED FOR IMPAIRMENT AT THE REPORTING UNIT LEVEL (OPERATING SEGMENT OR ONE LEVEL BELOW AN OPERATING SEGMENT) ON AN

ANNUAL BASIS (MAY 1 FOR US) AND BETWEEN ANNUAL TESTS IF AN EVENT OCCURS OR CIRCUMSTANCES CHANGE THAT WOULD MORE LIKELY THAN NOT REDUCE THE FAIR VALUE OF A REPORTING UNIT BELOW ITS CARRYING VALUE.

INTANGIBLE ASSETS

ALL OF OUR INTANGIBLE

ASSETS ARE SUBJECT TO AMORTIZATION AND ARE AMORTIZED USING THE STRAIGHT-LINE METHOD OVER THEIR ESTIMATED PERIOD OF BENEFIT, RANGING FROM ONE TO 15 YEARS. WE EVALUATE THE RECOVERABILITY OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS PERIODICALLY BY TAKING INTO ACCOUNT EVENTS

OR CIRCUMSTANCES THAT MAY WARRANT REVISED ESTIMATES OF USEFUL LIVES OR THAT INDICATE THE ASSET MAY BE IMPAIRED.

RECENT ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE NOT YET ADOPTED

IN MAY 2014, AS PART OF ITS ONGOING EFFORTS TO ASSIST IN THE CONVERGENCE OF U.S. GAAP AND INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL REPORTING STANDARDS, THE

FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD (FASB) ISSUED A NEW STANDARD RELATED TO REVENUE RECOGNITION. UNDER THE NEW STANDARD, RECOGNITION OF REVENUE OCCURS WHEN A CUSTOMER OBTAINS CONTROL OF PROMISED GOODS OR SERVICES IN AN AMOUNT THAT

REFLECTS THE CONSIDERATION WHICH THE ENTITY EXPECTS TO RECEIVE IN EXCHANGE FOR THOSE GOODS OR SERVICES. IN ADDITION, THE STANDARD REQUIRES DISCLOSURE OF THE NATURE, AMOUNT, TIMING, AND UNCERTAINTY OF REVENUE AND CASH FLOWS ARISING FROM CONTRACTS

WITH CUSTOMERS. THE NEW STANDARD WILL BE EFFECTIVE FOR US BEGINNING JULY 1, 2018, AND ADOPTION AS OF THE ORIGINAL EFFECTIVE DATE OF JULY 1, 2017 IS PERMITTED. WE ANTICIPATE THIS STANDARD WILL HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, AND WE ARE CURRENTLY EVALUATING ITS IMPACT.

NOTE 2  EARNINGS PER SHARE

BASIC EARNINGS PER SHARE (EPS) IS COMPUTED BASED ON THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE NUMBER OF SHARES OF COMMON STOCK

OUTSTANDING DURING THE PERIOD. DILUTED EPS IS COMPUTED BASED ON THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE NUMBER OF SHARES OF COMMON STOCK PLUS THE EFFECT OF DILUTIVE POTENTIAL COMMON SHARES OUTSTANDING DURING THE PERIOD USING THE TREASURY STOCK METHOD. DILUTIVE

POTENTIAL COMMON SHARES INCLUDE OUTSTANDING STOCK OPTIONS AND STOCK AWARDS.

IN ADDITION TO THE INVESTMENTS IN THE TABLE ABOVE, WE ALSO OWN CORPORATE NOTES THAT ARE CLASSIFIED AS

HELD-TO-MATURITY INVESTMENTS, WHICH ARE INCLUDED IN EQUITY AND OTHER INVESTMENTS ON THE BALANCE SHEET. THESE CORPORATE NOTES ARE DUE OCTOBER 31, 2023 AND ARE MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE ON A NONRECURRING BASIS. AS OF JUNE 30, 2015, THE

AMORTIZED COST AND RECORDED BASIS OF THESE CORPORATE NOTES WERE BOTH $25 MILLION WITH AN ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE THAT APPROXIMATES THE CARRYING VALUE. AS OF JUNE 30, 2014, THE AMORTIZED COST, RECORDED BASIS, AND ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF THESE

CORPORATE NOTES WAS $1.5 BILLION, $1.5 BILLION, AND $1.7 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY, WHILE THEIR ASSOCIATED GROSS UNREALIZED HOLDING GAINS WERE $164 MILLION.

AS OF JUNE 30, 2015 AND 2014, THE RECORDED BASES OF COMMON AND PREFERRED STOCK THAT ARE RESTRICTED FOR MORE THAN ONE YEAR OR ARE NOT PUBLICLY TRADED WERE $561 MILLION AND $520 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. THESE

INVESTMENTS ARE CARRIED AT COST AND ARE REVIEWED QUARTERLY FOR INDICATORS OF OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENT. IT IS NOT PRACTICABLE FOR US TO RELIABLY ESTIMATE THE FAIR VALUE OF THESE INVESTMENTS.

WE LEND CERTAIN FIXED-INCOME AND EQUITY SECURITIES TO INCREASE INVESTMENT RETURNS. THESE TRANSACTIONS ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AS SECURED BORROWINGS AND

THE LOANED SECURITIES CONTINUE TO BE CARRIED AS INVESTMENTS ON OUR BALANCE SHEET. CASH AND/OR SECURITY INTERESTS ARE RECEIVED AS COLLATERAL FOR THE LOANED SECURITIES WITH THE AMOUNT DETERMINED BASED UPON THE UNDERLYING SECURITY LENT AND THE

CREDITWORTHINESS OF THE BORROWER. AS OF JUNE 30, 2015, COLLATERAL RECEIVED UNDER THESE AGREEMENTS TOTALED $92 MILLION WHICH IS COMPRISED OF $79 MILLION OF CERTIFICATES OF DEPOSIT AND $13 MILLION OF U.S. GOVERNMENT AND AGENCY SECURITIES. THE

CONTRACTUAL MATURITIES OF THESE AGREEMENTS ARE PRIMARILY ON A CONTINUOUS AND OVERNIGHT BASIS.

UNREALIZED LOSSES FROM FIXED-INCOME SECURITIES ARE PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES. UNREALIZED

LOSSES FROM DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL EQUITIES ARE DUE TO MARKET PRICE MOVEMENTS. MANAGEMENT DOES NOT BELIEVE ANY REMAINING UNREALIZED LOSSES REPRESENT OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENTS BASED ON OUR EVALUATION OF AVAILABLE EVIDENCE AS OF

NOTE 5  DERIVATIVES

WE USE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS TO MANAGE RISKS RELATED TO FOREIGN CURRENCIES, EQUITY PRICES, INTEREST RATES, AND CREDIT; TO

ENHANCE INVESTMENT RETURNS; AND TO FACILITATE PORTFOLIO DIVERSIFICATION. OUR OBJECTIVES FOR HOLDING DERIVATIVES INCLUDE REDUCING, ELIMINATING, AND EFFICIENTLY MANAGING THE ECONOMIC IMPACT OF THESE EXPOSURES AS EFFECTIVELY AS POSSIBLE.

OUR DERIVATIVE PROGRAMS INCLUDE STRATEGIES THAT BOTH QUALIFY AND DO NOT QUALIFY FOR HEDGE ACCOUNTING TREATMENT. ALL NOTIONAL AMOUNTS PRESENTED

BELOW ARE MEASURED IN U.S. DOLLAR EQUIVALENTS.

FOREIGN CURRENCY

CERTAIN FORECASTED TRANSACTIONS, ASSETS, AND LIABILITIES ARE EXPOSED TO FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK. WE MONITOR OUR FOREIGN CURRENCY EXPOSURES DAILY TO MAXIMIZE THE ECONOMIC EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR FOREIGN CURRENCY HEDGE

POSITIONS. OPTION AND FORWARD CONTRACTS ARE USED TO HEDGE A PORTION OF FORECASTED INTERNATIONAL REVENUE FOR UP TO THREE YEARS IN THE FUTURE AND ARE DESIGNATED AS CASH FLOW HEDGING INSTRUMENTS. PRINCIPAL CURRENCIES HEDGED INCLUDE THE EURO, JAPANESE

YEN, BRITISH POUND, CANADIAN DOLLAR, AND AUSTRALIAN DOLLAR. AS OF JUNE 30, 2015 AND JUNE 30, 2014, THE TOTAL NOTIONAL AMOUNTS OF THESE FOREIGN EXCHANGE CONTRACTS SOLD WERE $9.8 BILLION AND $4.9 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY.

FOREIGN CURRENCY RISKS RELATED TO CERTAIN NON-U.S. DOLLAR DENOMINATED SECURITIES ARE HEDGED USING FOREIGN EXCHANGE FORWARD CONTRACTS THAT ARE

DESIGNATED AS FAIR VALUE HEDGING INSTRUMENTS. AS OF JUNE 30, 2015 AND JUNE 30, 2014, THE TOTAL NOTIONAL AMOUNTS OF THESE FOREIGN EXCHANGE CONTRACTS SOLD WERE $5.3 BILLION AND $3.1 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY.

CERTAIN OPTIONS AND FORWARDS NOT DESIGNATED AS HEDGING INSTRUMENTS ARE ALSO USED TO MANAGE THE VARIABILITY IN FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES ON CERTAIN

BALANCE SHEET AMOUNTS AND TO MANAGE OTHER FOREIGN CURRENCY EXPOSURES. AS OF JUNE 30, 2015, THE TOTAL NOTIONAL AMOUNTS OF THESE FOREIGN EXCHANGE CONTRACTS PURCHASED AND SOLD WERE $9.7 BILLION AND $11.0 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY. AS OF

JUNE 30, 2014, THE TOTAL NOTIONAL AMOUNTS OF THESE FOREIGN EXCHANGE CONTRACTS PURCHASED AND SOLD WERE $6.2 BILLION AND $8.5 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY.

EQUITY

SECURITIES HELD IN OUR EQUITY AND

OTHER INVESTMENTS PORTFOLIO ARE SUBJECT TO MARKET PRICE RISK. MARKET PRICE RISK IS MANAGED RELATIVE TO BROAD-BASED GLOBAL AND DOMESTIC EQUITY INDICES USING CERTAIN CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED INVESTMENTS, OPTIONS, FUTURES, AND SWAP CONTRACTS NOT

DESIGNATED AS HEDGING INSTRUMENTS. FROM TIME TO TIME, TO HEDGE OUR PRICE RISK, WE MAY USE AND DESIGNATE EQUITY DERIVATIVES AS HEDGING INSTRUMENTS, INCLUDING PUTS, CALLS, SWAPS, AND FORWARDS. AS OF JUNE 30, 2015, THE TOTAL NOTIONAL AMOUNTS

OF EQUITY CONTRACTS PURCHASED AND SOLD FOR MANAGING MARKET PRICE RISK WERE $2.2 BILLION AND $2.6 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY, OF WHICH $1.1 BILLION AND $1.4 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY, WERE DESIGNATED AS HEDGING INSTRUMENTS. AS OF JUNE 30, 2014, THE TOTAL

NOTIONAL AMOUNTS OF EQUITY CONTRACTS PURCHASED AND SOLD FOR MANAGING MARKET PRICE RISK WERE $1.9 BILLION AND $1.9 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY, OF WHICH $362 MILLION AND $420 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, WERE DESIGNATED AS HEDGING INSTRUMENTS.

INTEREST RATE

SECURITIES HELD IN OUR

FIXED-INCOME PORTFOLIO ARE SUBJECT TO DIFFERENT INTEREST RATE RISKS BASED ON THEIR MATURITIES. WE MANAGE THE AVERAGE MATURITY OF OUR FIXED-INCOME PORTFOLIO TO ACHIEVE ECONOMIC RETURNS THAT CORRELATE TO CERTAIN BROAD-BASED FIXED-INCOME INDICES USING

EXCHANGE-TRADED OPTION AND FUTURES CONTRACTS AND OVER-THE-COUNTER SWAP AND OPTION CONTRACTS, NONE OF WHICH ARE DESIGNATED AS HEDGING INSTRUMENTS. AS OF JUNE 30, 2015, THE TOTAL NOTIONAL AMOUNTS OF FIXED-INTEREST RATE CONTRACTS PURCHASED AND

SOLD WERE $1.0 BILLION AND $3.2 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY. AS OF JUNE 30, 2014, THE TOTAL NOTIONAL AMOUNTS OF FIXED-INTEREST RATE CONTRACTS PURCHASED AND SOLD WERE $1.7 BILLION AND $936 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY.

IN ADDITION, WE USE TO BE ANNOUNCED FORWARD PURCHASE COMMITMENTS OF MORTGAGE-BACKED ASSETS TO GAIN EXPOSURE TO AGENCY MORTGAGE-BACKED

SECURITIES. THESE MEET THE DEFINITION OF A DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENT IN CASES WHERE PHYSICAL DELIVERY OF THE ASSETS IS NOT TAKEN AT THE EARLIEST AVAILABLE DELIVERY DATE. AS OF JUNE 30, 2015 AND 2014, THE TOTAL NOTIONAL DERIVATIVE AMOUNTS OF

MORTGAGE CONTRACTS PURCHASED WERE $812 MILLION AND $1.1 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY.

CREDIT

OUR FIXED-INCOME PORTFOLIO IS DIVERSIFIED AND CONSISTS PRIMARILY OF INVESTMENT-GRADE SECURITIES. WE USE CREDIT DEFAULT SWAP CONTRACTS, NOT

DESIGNATED AS HEDGING INSTRUMENTS, TO MANAGE CREDIT EXPOSURES RELATIVE TO BROAD-BASED INDICES AND TO FACILITATE PORTFOLIO DIVERSIFICATION. WE USE CREDIT DEFAULT SWAPS AS THEY ARE A LOW-COST METHOD OF MANAGING EXPOSURE TO INDIVIDUAL CREDIT RISKS OR

GROUPS OF CREDIT RISKS. AS OF JUNE 30, 2015, THE TOTAL NOTIONAL AMOUNTS OF CREDIT CONTRACTS PURCHASED AND SOLD WERE $618 MILLION AND $430 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. AS OF JUNE 30, 2014, THE TOTAL NOTIONAL AMOUNTS OF CREDIT CONTRACTS PURCHASED

AND SOLD WERE $550 MILLION AND $440 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY.

ITEM 8

COMMODITY

WE USE BROAD-BASED COMMODITY EXPOSURES TO ENHANCE PORTFOLIO RETURNS AND TO FACILITATE PORTFOLIO DIVERSIFICATION. WE USE SWAPS, FUTURES, AND OPTION CONTRACTS, NOT DESIGNATED AS HEDGING INSTRUMENTS, TO GENERATE AND

MANAGE EXPOSURES TO BROAD-BASED COMMODITY INDICES. WE USE DERIVATIVES ON COMMODITIES AS THEY CAN BE LOW-COST ALTERNATIVES TO THE PURCHASE AND STORAGE OF A VARIETY OF COMMODITIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, PRECIOUS METALS, ENERGY, AND GRAIN. AS

OF JUNE 30, 2015, THE TOTAL NOTIONAL AMOUNTS OF COMMODITY CONTRACTS PURCHASED AND SOLD WERE $882 MILLION AND $316 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. AS OF JUNE 30, 2014, THE TOTAL NOTIONAL AMOUNTS OF COMMODITY CONTRACTS PURCHASED AND SOLD WERE $1.4

BILLION AND $408 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY.

CREDIT-RISK-RELATED CONTINGENT FEATURES

CERTAIN OF OUR COUNTERPARTY AGREEMENTS FOR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS CONTAIN PROVISIONS THAT REQUIRE OUR ISSUED AND OUTSTANDING LONG-TERM UNSECURED

DEBT TO MAINTAIN AN INVESTMENT GRADE CREDIT RATING AND REQUIRE US TO MAINTAIN MINIMUM LIQUIDITY OF $1.0 BILLION. TO THE EXTENT WE FAIL TO MEET THESE REQUIREMENTS, WE WILL BE REQUIRED TO POST COLLATERAL, SIMILAR TO THE STANDARD CONVENTION RELATED TO

OVER-THE-COUNTER DERIVATIVES. AS OF JUNE 30, 2015, OUR LONG-TERM UNSECURED DEBT RATING WAS AAA, AND CASH INVESTMENTS WERE IN EXCESS OF $1.0 BILLION. AS A RESULT, NO COLLATERAL WAS REQUIRED TO BE POSTED.

MOJANG SYNERGIES AB

ON

NOVEMBER 6, 2014, WE ACQUIRED MOJANG SYNERGIES AB (MOJANG), THE SWEDISH VIDEO GAME DEVELOPER OF THE MINECRAFT GAMING FRANCHISE, FOR $2.5 BILLION IN CASH, NET OF CASH ACQUIRED. THE ADDITION OF MINECRAFT AND ITS COMMUNITY ENHANCES OUR

GAMING PORTFOLIO ACROSS WINDOWS, XBOX, AND OTHER ECOSYSTEMS BESIDES OUR OWN. OUR PURCHASE PRICE ALLOCATION IS PRELIMINARY AND SUBJECT TO REVISION AS MORE DETAILED ANALYSES ARE COMPLETED AND ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT FAIR VALUE OF ASSETS AND

LIABILITIES BECOMES AVAILABLE, INCLUDING ADDITIONAL INFORMATION RELATING TO TAX MATTERS AND FINALIZATION OF OUR VALUATION OF IDENTIFIED INTANGIBLE ASSETS.

THE SIGNIFICANT CLASSES OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES TO WHICH WE PRELIMINARILY ALLOCATED THE PURCHASE PRICE WERE GOODWILL OF $1.8 BILLION AND IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS OF $928 MILLION, PRIMARILY MARKETING-RELATED

(TRADE NAMES). THE GOODWILL RECOGNIZED IN CONNECTION WITH THE ACQUISITION IS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO ANTICIPATED SYNERGIES FROM FUTURE GROWTH, AND IS NOT EXPECTED TO BE DEDUCTIBLE FOR TAX PURPOSES. WE ASSIGNED THE GOODWILL TO OUR DEVICES AND

CONSUMER (D&C) OTHER SEGMENT. IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS WERE ASSIGNED A TOTAL WEIGHTED-AVERAGE AMORTIZATION PERIOD OF 6.3 YEARS. MOJANG HAS BEEN INCLUDED IN OUR CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS SINCE THE ACQUISITION DATE.

NOKIAS DEVICES AND SERVICES BUSINESS

ON APRIL 25, 2014, WE ACQUIRED SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF NOKIA CORPORATIONS (NOKIA) DEVICES AND SERVICES BUSINESS (NDS) FOR A TOTAL PURCHASE PRICE OF $9.4 BILLION, INCLUDING CASH

ACQUIRED OF $1.5 BILLION (THE ACQUISITION). THE PURCHASE PRICE CONSISTED PRIMARILY OF CASH OF $7.1 BILLION AND NOKIAS REPURCHASE OF CONVERTIBLE NOTES OF $2.1 BILLION, WHICH WAS A NON-CASH TRANSACTION, AND LIABILITIES ASSUMED OF

$0.2 BILLION. THE ACQUISITION WAS EXPECTED TO ACCELERATE THE GROWTH OF OUR D&C BUSINESS THROUGH FASTER INNOVATION, SYNERGIES, AND UNIFIED BRANDING AND MARKETING.

THE ALLOCATION OF THE PURCHASE PRICE TO GOODWILL WAS COMPLETED AS OF MARCH 31, 2015. THE MAJOR CLASSES OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES TO WHICH WE HAVE ALLOCATED THE PURCHASE PRICE WERE AS FOLLOWS.

DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF FISCAL YEAR 2014, WE INCURRED $21 MILLION OF ACQUISITION COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE PURCHASE OF NDS. ACQUISITION COSTS

ARE PRIMARILY COMPRISED OF TRANSACTION FEES AND DIRECT ACQUISITION COSTS, INCLUDING LEGAL, FINANCE, CONSULTING, AND OTHER PROFESSIONAL FEES. THESE COSTS ARE INCLUDED IN IMPAIRMENT, INTEGRATION, AND RESTRUCTURING EXPENSES ON OUR CONSOLIDATED INCOME

STATEMENT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2014.

CERTAIN CONCURRENT TRANSACTIONS WERE RECOGNIZED SEPARATELY FROM THE ACQUISITION. PRIOR TO THE

ACQUISITION, WE HAD JOINT STRATEGIC INITIATIVES WITH NOKIA; THIS CONTRACTUAL RELATIONSHIP WAS TERMINATED IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE ACQUISITION. NO GAIN OR LOSS WAS RECORDED UPON TERMINATION OF THIS AGREEMENT, AS IT WAS DETERMINED TO BE AT MARKET

VALUE. IN ADDITION, WE AGREED TO LICENSE NOKIAS MAPPING SERVICES AND WILL PAY NOKIA SEPARATELY FOR THE SERVICES PROVIDED UNDER A FOUR-YEAR LICENSE AS THEY ARE RENDERED.

YAMMER

ON JULY 18, 2012, WE ACQUIRED YAMMER, INC. (YAMMER), A LEADING

PROVIDER OF ENTERPRISE SOCIAL NETWORKS, FOR $1.1 BILLION IN CASH. YAMMER ADDED AN ENTERPRISE SOCIAL NETWORKING SERVICE TO MICROSOFTS PORTFOLIO OF COMPLEMENTARY CLOUD-BASED SERVICES. THE MAJOR CLASSES OF ASSETS TO WHICH WE ALLOCATED THE

PURCHASE PRICE WERE GOODWILL OF $937 MILLION AND IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS OF $178 MILLION. WE ASSIGNED THE GOODWILL TO COMMERCIAL OTHER UNDER OUR CURRENT SEGMENT STRUCTURE. YAMMER WAS CONSOLIDATED INTO OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS STARTING ON THE

ACQUISITION DATE.

GOODWILL ACQUIRED DURING FISCAL YEAR 2014 RELATED TO THE ACQUISITION OF NDS. SEE NOTE 9  BUSINESS COMBINATIONS FOR ADDITIONAL DETAILS.

THE MEASUREMENT PERIODS FOR THE VALUATION OF ASSETS ACQUIRED AND LIABILITIES ASSUMED END AS SOON AS INFORMATION ON

THE FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES THAT EXISTED AS OF THE ACQUISITION DATES BECOMES AVAILABLE, BUT DO NOT EXCEED 12 MONTHS. ADJUSTMENTS IN PURCHASE PRICE ALLOCATIONS MAY REQUIRE A RECASTING OF THE AMOUNTS ALLOCATED TO GOODWILL RETROACTIVE TO THE PERIODS IN

WHICH THE ACQUISITIONS OCCURRED.

ANY CHANGE IN THE GOODWILL AMOUNTS RESULTING FROM FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATIONS AND PURCHASE

ACCOUNTING ADJUSTMENTS ARE PRESENTED AS OTHER IN THE ABOVE TABLE. ALSO INCLUDED IN OTHER ARE BUSINESS DISPOSITIONS AND TRANSFERS BETWEEN BUSINESS SEGMENTS DUE TO REORGANIZATIONS, AS APPLICABLE. FOR FISCAL YEAR 2015, A $5.1

BILLION GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT CHARGE WAS INCLUDED IN OTHER, AS DISCUSSED FURTHER BELOW. THIS GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT CHARGE WAS INCLUDED IN IMPAIRMENT, INTEGRATION, AND RESTRUCTURING EXPENSES IN OUR CONSOLIDATED INCOME STATEMENT, AND REFLECTED

IN CORPORATE AND OTHER IN OUR TABLE OF OPERATING INCOME (LOSS) BY SEGMENT GROUP IN NOTE 22  SEGMENT INFORMATION AND GEOGRAPHIC DATA.

OUR ACCUMULATED GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT AS OF JUNE 30, 2015 AND 2014 WAS $11.3 BILLION AND $6.2 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY.

ITEM 8

GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT

WE TEST GOODWILL FOR IMPAIRMENT ANNUALLY ON MAY 1 AT THE REPORTING UNIT LEVEL, PRIMARILY USING A DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW METHODOLOGY WITH A PEER-BASED, RISK-ADJUSTED WEIGHTED AVERAGE COST OF CAPITAL. WE BELIEVE

USE OF A DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW APPROACH IS THE MOST RELIABLE INDICATOR OF THE FAIR VALUES OF THE BUSINESSES.

UPON COMPLETION OF THE

ANNUAL TESTING AS OF MAY 1, 2015, PHONE HARDWARE GOODWILL WAS DETERMINED TO BE IMPAIRED. IN THE SECOND HALF OF FISCAL YEAR 2015, PHONE HARDWARE DID NOT MEET ITS SALES VOLUME AND REVENUE GOALS, AND THE MIX OF UNITS SOLD HAD LOWER MARGINS THAN

PLANNED. THESE RESULTS, ALONG WITH CHANGES IN THE COMPETITIVE MARKETPLACE AND AN EVALUATION OF BUSINESS PRIORITIES, LED TO A SHIFT IN STRATEGIC DIRECTION AND REDUCED FUTURE REVENUE AND PROFITABILITY EXPECTATIONS FOR THE BUSINESS. AS A RESULT OF

THESE CHANGES IN STRATEGY AND EXPECTATIONS, WE HAVE FORECASTED REDUCTIONS IN UNIT VOLUME GROWTH RATES AND LOWER FUTURE CASH FLOWS USED TO ESTIMATE THE FAIR VALUE OF THE PHONE HARDWARE REPORTING UNIT, WHICH RESULTED IN THE DETERMINATION THAT AN

IMPAIRMENT ADJUSTMENT WAS REQUIRED.

BECAUSE OUR ANNUAL TEST INDICATED THAT PHONE HARDWARES CARRYING VALUE EXCEEDED ITS ESTIMATED

FAIR VALUE, A SECOND PHASE OF THE GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT TEST (STEP 2) WAS PERFORMED SPECIFIC TO PHONE HARDWARE. UNDER STEP 2, THE FAIR VALUE OF ALL PHONE HARDWARE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES WERE ESTIMATED, INCLUDING TANGIBLE ASSETS, EXISTING

TECHNOLOGY, PATENT AGREEMENTS, AND CONTRACTUAL ARRANGEMENTS, FOR THE PURPOSE OF DERIVING AN ESTIMATE OF THE IMPLIED FAIR VALUE OF GOODWILL. THE IMPLIED FAIR VALUE OF THE GOODWILL WAS THEN COMPARED TO THE RECORDED GOODWILL TO DETERMINE THE AMOUNT OF

THE IMPAIRMENT. ASSUMPTIONS USED IN MEASURING THE VALUE OF THESE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES INCLUDED THE DISCOUNT RATES AND ROYALTY RATES USED IN VALUING THE INTANGIBLE ASSETS, AND CONSIDERATION OF THE MARKET ENVIRONMENT IN VALUING THE TANGIBLE ASSETS.

NO OTHER INSTANCES OF IMPAIRMENT WERE IDENTIFIED IN OUR MAY 1, 2015 TEST. NO IMPAIRMENT OF GOODWILL WAS IDENTIFIED AS OF

MAY 1, 2014.

WE ESTIMATE THAT WE HAVE NO SIGNIFICANT RESIDUAL VALUE

RELATED TO OUR INTANGIBLE ASSETS. DURING FISCAL YEAR 2015, WE RECORDED IMPAIRMENT CHARGES OF $2.2 BILLION RELATED TO OUR PHONE HARDWARE INTANGIBLE ASSETS. IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF FISCAL YEAR 2015, WE TESTED THE INTANGIBLE ASSETS FOR RECOVERABILITY

DUE TO CHANGES IN FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES ASSOCIATED WITH THE SHIFT IN STRATEGIC DIRECTION AND REDUCED PROFITABILITY EXPECTATIONS FOR PHONE HARDWARE. BASED ON THE RESULTS OF OUR TESTING, WE DETERMINED THAT THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE INTANGIBLE ASSETS

WAS NOT RECOVERABLE, AND AN IMPAIRMENT CHARGE WAS RECORDED TO THE EXTENT THAT ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE EXCEEDED CARRYING VALUE. WE PRIMARILY USED A RELIEF FROM ROYALTY INCOME APPROACH TO DETERMINE THE FAIR VALUE OF THE INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND DETERMINE

THE AMOUNT OF IMPAIRMENT. THESE INTANGIBLE ASSETS IMPAIRMENT CHARGES WERE INCLUDED IN IMPAIRMENT, INTEGRATION, AND RESTRUCTURING EXPENSES IN OUR CONSOLIDATED INCOME STATEMENT, AND REFLECTED IN CORPORATE AND OTHER IN OUR TABLE OF OPERATING INCOME

THE REDUCTION FROM THE FEDERAL STATUTORY RATE IS PRIMARILY DUE TO FOREIGN EARNINGS TAXED AT LOWER

RATES RESULTING FROM PRODUCING AND DISTRIBUTING OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES THROUGH OUR FOREIGN REGIONAL OPERATIONS CENTERS IN IRELAND, SINGAPORE, AND PUERTO RICO. IN FISCAL YEAR 2015, THIS REDUCTION WAS MOSTLY OFFSET BY LOSSES IN FOREIGN

JURISDICTIONS FOR WHICH WE MAY NOT REALIZE A TAX BENEFIT, PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF IMPAIRMENT AND RESTRUCTURING CHARGES. EXCLUDING THESE LOSSES, OUR FOREIGN EARNINGS, WHICH ARE TAXED AT RATES LOWER THAN THE U.S. RATE AND ARE GENERATED FROM OUR

REGIONAL OPERATING CENTERS, WERE 73%, 81%, AND 79% OF OUR FOREIGN INCOME BEFORE TAX IN FISCAL YEARS 2015, 2014, AND 2013, RESPECTIVELY. IN GENERAL, OTHER RECONCILING ITEMS CONSIST OF INTEREST, U.S. STATE INCOME TAXES, AND CREDITS. IN FISCAL YEARS

PHASE OF THE EXAMINATION. AS OF JUNE 30, 2015, THE PRIMARY UNRESOLVED ISSUE RELATES TO TRANSFER PRICING, WHICH COULD HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IF NOT RESOLVED FAVORABLY. WE BELIEVE OUR ALLOWANCES FOR

INCOME TAX CONTINGENCIES ARE ADEQUATE. WE HAVE NOT RECEIVED A PROPOSED ASSESSMENT FOR THE UNRESOLVED ISSUES AND DO NOT EXPECT A FINAL RESOLUTION OF THESE ISSUES IN THE NEXT 12 MONTHS. BASED ON THE INFORMATION CURRENTLY AVAILABLE, WE DO NOT

ANTICIPATE A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE OR DECREASE TO OUR TAX CONTINGENCIES FOR THESE ISSUES WITHIN THE NEXT 12 MONTHS. WE ALSO CONTINUE TO BE SUBJECT TO EXAMINATION BY THE I.R.S. FOR TAX YEARS 2007 TO 2015.

WE ARE SUBJECT TO INCOME TAX IN MANY JURISDICTIONS OUTSIDE THE U.S. OUR OPERATIONS IN CERTAIN JURISDICTIONS REMAIN SUBJECT TO EXAMINATION FOR TAX

YEARS 1996 TO 2015, SOME OF WHICH ARE CURRENTLY UNDER AUDIT BY LOCAL TAX AUTHORITIES. THE RESOLUTIONS OF THESE AUDITS ARE NOT EXPECTED TO BE MATERIAL TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

PATENT AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY CLAIMS

MOTOROLA LITIGATION

IN OCTOBER 2010,

MICROSOFT FILED PATENT INFRINGEMENT COMPLAINTS AGAINST MOTOROLA MOBILITY (MOTOROLA) WITH THE INTERNATIONAL TRADE COMMISSION (ITC) AND IN U.S. DISTRICT COURT IN SEATTLE FOR INFRINGEMENT OF NINE MICROSOFT PATENTS BY

MOTOROLAS ANDROID DEVICES. MICROSOFT AND MOTOROLA HAVE FILED ADDITIONAL CLAIMS AGAINST EACH OTHER WITH THE ITC, IN FEDERAL DISTRICT COURTS IN SEATTLE, WISCONSIN, FLORIDA, AND CALIFORNIA, AND IN COURTS IN GERMANY. THE NATURE OF THE CLAIMS

ASSERTED AND STATUS OF INDIVIDUAL MATTERS ARE SUMMARIZED BELOW.

INTERNATIONAL TRADE COMMISSION

IN 2012, THE ITC ISSUED A LIMITED EXCLUSION ORDER AGAINST MOTOROLA ON ONE MICROSOFT PATENT, WHICH WAS AFFIRMED ON APPEAL. IN 2013, MICROSOFT FILED

AN ACTION IN U.S. DISTRICT COURT IN WASHINGTON, D.C. SEEKING AN ORDER TO COMPEL ENFORCEMENT OF THE ITCS 2012 IMPORT BAN AGAINST INFRINGING MOTOROLA PRODUCTS BY THE BUREAU OF CUSTOMS AND BORDER PROTECTION (CBP), AFTER LEARNING THAT

CBP HAD FAILED TO FULLY ENFORCE THE ORDER.

IN 2010, MOTOROLA FILED AN ACTION AGAINST MICROSOFT WITH THE ITC ALLEGING INFRINGEMENT OF

FIVE MOTOROLA PATENTS BY XBOX CONSOLES AND ACCESSORIES AND SEEKING AN EXCLUSION ORDER TO PROHIBIT IMPORTATION OF THE ALLEGEDLY INFRINGING

PART II

ITEM 8

XBOX PRODUCTS. AT MOTOROLAS REQUEST, THE ITC TERMINATED ITS INVESTIGATION OF FOUR MOTOROLA PATENTS. IN 2013, THE ITC AFFIRMED THERE WAS NO VIOLATION OF THE REMAINING MOTOROLA PATENT.

MOTOROLA APPEALED THE ITCS DECISION TO THE U.S. COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE FEDERAL CIRCUIT.

U.S. DISTRICT COURT

THE SEATTLE DISTRICT COURT CASE FILED IN OCTOBER 2010 BY MICROSOFT AS A COMPANION TO MICROSOFTS ITC CASE AGAINST MOTOROLA WAS STAYED PENDING

THE OUTCOME OF THE ITC CASE.

IN NOVEMBER 2010, MICROSOFT SUED MOTOROLA FOR BREACH OF CONTRACT IN U.S. DISTRICT COURT IN SEATTLE,

ALLEGING THAT MOTOROLA BREACHED ITS COMMITMENTS TO STANDARDS-SETTING ORGANIZATIONS TO LICENSE TO MICROSOFT CERTAIN PATENTS ON REASONABLE AND NON-DISCRIMINATORY (RAND) TERMS AND CONDITIONS. MOTOROLA HAS DECLARED THESE PATENTS ESSENTIAL TO

THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE H.264 VIDEO STANDARD AND THE 802.11 WI-FI STANDARD. IN THE MOTOROLA ITC CASE DESCRIBED ABOVE AND IN SUITS DESCRIBED BELOW, MOTOROLA OR A MOTOROLA AFFILIATE SUBSEQUENTLY SUED MICROSOFT ON THOSE PATENTS IN U.S. DISTRICT

COURTS, IN THE ITC, AND IN GERMANY. IN 2012, THE SEATTLE DISTRICT COURT GRANTED A PARTIAL SUMMARY JUDGMENT IN FAVOR OF MICROSOFT RULING THAT (1) MOTOROLA HAD COMMITTED TO STANDARDS ORGANIZATIONS TO LICENSE ITS DECLARED-ESSENTIAL PATENTS ON RAND

TERMS AND CONDITIONS; AND (2) MICROSOFT IS A THIRD-PARTY BENEFICIARY OF THOSE COMMITMENTS. AFTER TRIAL, THE SEATTLE DISTRICT COURT SET PER UNIT ROYALTIES FOR MOTOROLAS H.264 AND 802.11 PATENTS, WHICH RESULTED IN AN IMMATERIAL MICROSOFT

LIABILITY. IN 2013, FOLLOWING TRIAL OF MICROSOFTS BREACH OF CONTRACT CLAIM, A JURY AWARDED $14.5 MILLION IN DAMAGES TO MICROSOFT. MOTOROLA APPEALED WITH RESPECT TO BOTH THE COURTS DETERMINATION OF ROYALTIES DUE MOTOROLA AND THE

JURYS AWARD OF DAMAGES AGAINST MOTOROLA; IN JULY 2015 THE U.S. COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT AFFIRMED THE TRIAL COURTS JUDGMENT IN ALL RESPECTS.

CASES FILED BY MOTOROLA IN WISCONSIN, CALIFORNIA, AND FLORIDA, WITH THE EXCEPTION OF ONE CASE IN WISCONSIN INITIALLY STAYED AND LATER DISMISSED WITHOUT PREJUDICE (A COMPANION CASE TO MOTOROLAS ITC ACTION),

HAVE BEEN TRANSFERRED TO THE U.S DISTRICT COURT IN SEATTLE. MOTOROLA AND MICROSOFT BOTH SEEK DAMAGES AS WELL AS INJUNCTIVE RELIEF. THE COURT HAS STAYED THESE CASES IN SEATTLE ON AGREEMENT OF THE PARTIES.



IN THE TRANSFERRED CASES, MOTOROLA ASSERTS 15 PATENTS ARE INFRINGED BY A RANGE OF MICROSOFT PRODUCTS INCLUDING MOBILE AND PC OPERATING SYSTEM, PRODUCTIVITY,

SERVER, COMMUNICATION, BROWSER AND GAMING PRODUCTS.



IN THE MOTOROLA ACTION ORIGINALLY FILED IN CALIFORNIA, MOTOROLA ASSERTS MICROSOFT VIOLATED ANTITRUST LAWS IN CONNECTION WITH MICROSOFTS ASSERTION OF

PATENTS AGAINST MOTOROLA THAT MICROSOFT AGREED TO LICENSE TO CERTAIN QUALIFYING ENTITIES ON RAND TERMS AND CONDITIONS.



IN COUNTERCLAIMS, MICROSOFT ASSERTS 14 PATENTS ARE INFRINGED BY MOTOROLA ANDROID DEVICES AND CERTAIN MOTOROLA DIGITAL VIDEO RECORDERS.

GERMANY

IN

2011, MOTOROLA FILED PATENT INFRINGEMENT ACTIONS IN GERMANY AGAINST MICROSOFT AND SEVERAL MICROSOFT SUBSIDIARIES.



MOTOROLA ASSERTS TWO PATENTS (BOTH NOW EXPIRED) ARE ESSENTIAL TO IMPLEMENTATION OF THE H.264 VIDEO STANDARD, AND MOTOROLA ALLEGES THAT H.264 CAPABLE PRODUCTS

INCLUDING XBOX 360, WINDOWS 7, MEDIA PLAYER, AND INTERNET EXPLORER INFRINGE THOSE PATENTS. IN 2012, THE COURT ISSUED AN INJUNCTION RELATING TO ALL H.264 CAPABLE MICROSOFT PRODUCTS IN GERMANY, WHICH MICROSOFT APPEALED. ORDERS IN THE LITIGATION

PENDING IN SEATTLE, WASHINGTON DESCRIBED ABOVE ENJOIN MOTOROLA FROM ENFORCING THE GERMAN INJUNCTION.



MOTOROLA ASSERTS THAT ONE PATENT COVERS CERTAIN SYNCING FUNCTIONALITY IN THE ACTIVESYNC PROTOCOL EMPLOYED BY WINDOWS PHONE 7, OUTLOOK MOBILE, HOTMAIL MOBILE,

EXCHANGE ONLINE, EXCHANGE SERVER, AND HOTMAIL SERVER. IN 2013, THE COURT STAYED THE CASE PENDING THE OUTCOME OF PARALLEL PROCEEDINGS IN WHICH MICROSOFT IS SEEKING TO INVALIDATE THE PATENT. IN 2013, THE FEDERAL PATENT COURT INVALIDATED THE ORIGINALLY

ISSUED PATENT CLAIMS, BUT RULED THAT CERTAIN NEW AMENDED CLAIMS WERE PATENTABLE. BOTH MOTOROLA AND MICROSOFT APPEALED. IN JUNE 2014, THE COURT REOPENED INFRINGEMENT PROCEEDINGS, WHICH ARE CURRENTLY STAYED.



MICROSOFT MAY BE ABLE TO MITIGATE THE ADVERSE IMPACT OF ANY INJUNCTION BY ALTERING ITS PRODUCTS TO AVOID MOTOROLAS INFRINGEMENT CLAIMS.



ANY DAMAGES WOULD BE DETERMINED IN SEPARATE PROCEEDINGS.

ITEM 8

IN LAWSUITS MICROSOFT FILED IN GERMANY IN 2011 AND 2012, MICROSOFT ASSERTS THAT MOTOROLA ANDROID

DEVICES INFRINGE MICROSOFT PATENTS AND IS SEEKING DAMAGES AND INJUNCTIONS. IN 2012, REGIONAL COURTS IN GERMANY ISSUED INJUNCTIONS ON THREE OF THE MICROSOFT PATENTS, WHICH MOTOROLA APPEALED. ONE JUDGMENT HAS BEEN AFFIRMED ON APPEAL (AND MOTOROLA HAS

FURTHER APPEALED), AND THE OTHER TWO APPEALS ARE PENDING (IN ONE OF THESE TWO CASES THE ASSERTED PATENT HAS EXPIRED). AN ADDITIONAL INFRINGEMENT PROCEEDING IS STILL PENDING IN THE COURT OF FIRST INSTANCE. IN ACTIONS FILED SEPARATELY BY MOTOROLA TO

INVALIDATE THESE PATENTS, THE FEDERAL PATENT COURT IN 2013 AND 2014 HELD THE MICROSOFT PATENTS INVALID, AND MICROSOFT APPEALED. FOR THE CASES IN WHICH MICROSOFT OBTAINED INJUNCTIONS, IF MOTOROLA WERE TO PREVAIL FOLLOWING ALL APPEALS, MOTOROLA COULD

HAVE A CLAIM AGAINST MICROSOFT FOR DAMAGES CAUSED BY AN ERRONEOUSLY GRANTED INJUNCTION.

IPCOM PATENT LITIGATION

IPCOM GMBH & CO. (IPCOM) IS A GERMAN COMPANY THAT HOLDS A LARGE PORTFOLIO OF MOBILE TECHNOLOGY-RELATED PATENTS SPANNING ABOUT

170 PATENT FAMILIES AND ADDRESSING A BROAD RANGE OF CELLULAR TECHNOLOGIES. IPCOM HAS ASSERTED 19 OF THESE PATENTS IN LITIGATION AGAINST NOKIA AND MANY OF THE LEADING CELL PHONE COMPANIES AND OPERATORS. IN NOVEMBER 2014, MICROSOFT AND IPCOM ENTERED

INTO A STANDSTILL AGREEMENT STAYING ALL OF THE PENDING LITIGATION AGAINST MICROSOFT TO PERMIT THE PARTIES TO PURSUE SETTLEMENT DISCUSSIONS.

INTERDIGITAL PATENT LITIGATION

INTERDIGITAL TECHNOLOGY CORPORATION AND INTERDIGITAL COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION (COLLECTIVELY, IDT) FILED FOUR PATENT INFRINGEMENT

CASES AGAINST NOKIA IN THE ITC AND IN U.S. DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE BETWEEN 2007 AND 2013. WE HAVE BEEN ADDED TO THESE CASES AS A DEFENDANT. IDT HAS CASES PENDING AGAINST OTHER DEFENDANTS BASED ON THE SAME PATENTS BECAUSE MOST OF

THE PATENTS AT ISSUE ALLEGEDLY RELATE TO 3G AND 4G WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS STANDARDS ESSENTIAL FUNCTIONALITY. THE CASES INVOLVING US INCLUDE THREE ITC INVESTIGATIONS WHERE IDT IS SEEKING AN ORDER EXCLUDING IMPORTATION OF 3G AND 4G PHONES INTO THE

U.S. AND ONE ACTIVE CASE IN U.S. DISTRICT COURT IN DELAWARE SEEKING AN INJUNCTION AND DAMAGES. THE ITC ISSUED A FINDING OF NO VIOLATION RELATING TO TWO OF THE INVESTIGATIONS, WHICH IDT APPEALED. IN FEBRUARY 2015, THE U.S. COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE

FEDERAL CIRCUIT AFFIRMED ONE OF THE ITCS FINDINGS; THE OTHER HAS BEEN STAYED. IN THE THIRD ITC ACTION THE ADMINISTRATIVE LAW JUDGE (ALJ) ISSUED A DETERMINATION FINDING: (1) INFRINGEMENT; (2) EVIDENCE OF REVERSE

HOLD-UP; AND (3) THE PUBLIC INTEREST DOES NOT PRECLUDE ISSUANCE OF AN EXCLUSION ORDER. THE ITC IS REVIEWING THE ALJS INITIAL DETERMINATION. THE TRIAL IN THE DELAWARE CASE IS SCHEDULED FOR NOVEMBER 2015.

EUROPEAN COPYRIGHT LEVIES

WE ASSUMED FROM

NOKIA ALL POTENTIAL LIABILITY DUE TO NOKIAS ALLEGED FAILURE TO PAY PRIVATE COPYING LEVIES IN VARIOUS EUROPEAN COUNTRIES BASED UPON SALE OF MEMORY CARDS AND MOBILE PHONES THAT INCORPORATE BLANK MEMORY. THE LEVIES ARE BASED UPON

A 2001 EUROPEAN UNION (EU) DIRECTIVE ESTABLISHING A RIGHT FOR END USERS TO MAKE COPIES OF COPYRIGHTED WORKS FOR PERSONAL OR PRIVATE USE, BUT ALSO ALLOWING THE COLLECTION OF LEVIES BASED UPON SALES OF BLANK MEDIA OR RECORDING DEVICES TO

COMPENSATE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS FOR PRIVATE COPYING. VARIOUS COLLECTING SOCIETIES IN EU COUNTRIES INITIATED LITIGATION AGAINST NOKIA, STATING THAT NOKIA MUST PAY LEVIES NOT ONLY BASED UPON SALES OF BLANK MEMORY CARDS, BUT ALSO PHONES THAT INCLUDE

BLANK MEMORY FOR DATA STORAGE ON THE PHONES, REGARDLESS OF ACTUAL USAGE OF THAT MEMORY. THE MOST SIGNIFICANT CASES AGAINST NOKIA ARE PENDING IN GERMANY AND AUSTRIA, DUE TO BOTH THE HIGH VOLUME OF SALES AND HIGH LEVY AMOUNTS SOUGHT IN THESE

COUNTRIES. SINCE APRIL 2015, WE AND OTHER MAJOR MANUFACTURERS HAVE BEEN ENGAGED IN SETTLEMENT NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE GERMAN COLLECTING SOCIETY, WITH THE AIM OF CONCLUDING NEGOTIATIONS BY OCTOBER 2015.

OTHER PATENT AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY CLAIMS

IN ADDITION TO THESE CASES, THERE ARE APPROXIMATELY 70 OTHER PATENT INFRINGEMENT CASES PENDING AGAINST MICROSOFT.

ANTITRUST, UNFAIR COMPETITION, AND OVERCHARGE CLASS ACTIONS

A LARGE NUMBER OF ANTITRUST AND UNFAIR COMPETITION CLASS ACTION LAWSUITS WERE FILED AGAINST US IN VARIOUS STATE, FEDERAL, AND CANADIAN COURTS ON

BEHALF OF VARIOUS CLASSES OF DIRECT AND INDIRECT PURCHASERS OF OUR PC OPERATING SYSTEM AND CERTAIN OTHER SOFTWARE PRODUCTS BETWEEN 1999 AND 2005.

WE OBTAINED DISMISSALS OR REACHED SETTLEMENTS OF ALL CLAIMS MADE IN THE U.S. UNDER THE SETTLEMENTS, GENERALLY CLASS MEMBERS CAN OBTAIN VOUCHERS THAT ENTITLE THEM TO BE REIMBURSED FOR PURCHASES OF A WIDE VARIETY OF

PLATFORM-NEUTRAL COMPUTER HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE. THE TOTAL VALUE OF VOUCHERS THAT WE MAY ISSUE VARIES BY STATE. WE WILL MAKE AVAILABLE TO CERTAIN SCHOOLS A PERCENTAGE OF THOSE VOUCHERS THAT ARE NOT ISSUED OR CLAIMED (ONE-HALF TO TWO-THIRDS DEPENDING

ON THE STATE). THE TOTAL VALUE OF VOUCHERS WE ULTIMATELY ISSUE WILL DEPEND ON THE NUMBER OF CLASS MEMBERS WHO MAKE CLAIMS AND ARE ISSUED VOUCHERS. WE ESTIMATE THE TOTAL REMAINING COST OF THE SETTLEMENTS IS APPROXIMATELY $200 MILLION, ALL OF WHICH

HAD BEEN ACCRUED AS OF JUNE 30, 2015.

THREE SIMILAR CASES PENDING IN BRITISH COLUMBIA, ONTARIO, AND QUEBEC, CANADA HAVE NOT BEEN

SETTLED. IN 2010, THE COURT IN THE BRITISH COLUMBIA CASE CERTIFIED IT AS A CLASS ACTION. AFTER THE BRITISH COLUMBIA COURT OF APPEAL DISMISSED THE CASE, IN 2013 THE CANADIAN SUPREME COURT REVERSED THE APPELLATE COURT AND REINSTATED PART OF THE

BRITISH COLUMBIA CASE, WHICH IS NOW SCHEDULED FOR TRIAL IN 2016. THE OTHER TWO CASES ARE INACTIVE.

OTHER ANTITRUST LITIGATION AND CLAIMS

GO COMPUTER LITIGATION

IN

JUNE 2005, GO COMPUTER INC. AND CO-FOUNDER JERRY KAPLAN FILED A COMPLAINT IN CALIFORNIA STATE COURT ASSERTING ANTITRUST CLAIMS UNDER THE CARTWRIGHT ACT RELATED TO THE BUSINESS OF THE FORMER GO CORPORATION IN THE EARLY 1990S AND ITS SUCCESSOR IN

INTEREST, LUCENT CORPORATION IN THE EARLY 2000S. ALL CLAIMS PRIOR TO JUNE 2001 HAVE BEEN DISMISSED WITH PREJUDICE AS BARRED BY THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS. THE CASE IS MOVING FORWARD WITH DISCOVERY, AND A TRIAL IS SET FOR SEPTEMBER 2015.

CHINA STATE ADMINISTRATION FOR INDUSTRY AND COMMERCE INVESTIGATIO

N

IN JULY 2014, MICROSOFT WAS INFORMED THAT CHINAS STATE ADMINISTRATION FOR INDUSTRY AND COMMERCE (SAIC) HAD BEGUN A FORMAL INVESTIGATION RELATING TO CHINAS ANTI-MONOPOLY LAW, AND THE SAIC

CONDUCTED ONSITE INSPECTIONS OF MICROSOFT OFFICES IN BEIJING, SHANGHAI, GUANGZHOU, AND CHENGDU. SAIC HAS STATED THE INVESTIGATION RELATES TO COMPATIBILITY, BUNDLE SALES, AND FILE VERIFICATION ISSUES RELATED TO WINDOWS AND OFFICE SOFTWARE.

PRODUCT-RELATED LITIGATION

U.S. CELL PHONE

LITIGATION

NOKIA, ALONG WITH OTHER HANDSET MANUFACTURERS AND NETWORK OPERATORS, IS A DEFENDANT IN 19 LAWSUITS FILED IN THE SUPERIOR

COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA BY INDIVIDUAL PLAINTIFFS WHO ALLEGE THAT RADIO EMISSIONS FROM CELLULAR HANDSETS CAUSED THEIR BRAIN TUMORS AND OTHER ADVERSE HEALTH EFFECTS. WE HAVE ASSUMED RESPONSIBILITY FOR THESE CLAIMS AS PART OF THE NDS

ACQUISITION AND HAVE BEEN SUBSTITUTED FOR THE NOKIA DEFENDANTS. NINE OF THESE CASES WERE FILED IN 2002 AND ARE CONSOLIDATED FOR CERTAIN PRE-TRIAL PROCEEDINGS; THE REMAINING 10 CASES ARE STAYED. IN A SEPARATE 2009 DECISION, THE COURT OF APPEALS FOR

THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA HELD THAT ADVERSE HEALTH EFFECT CLAIMS ARISING FROM THE USE OF CELLULAR HANDSETS THAT OPERATE WITHIN THE U.S. FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION RADIO FREQUENCY EMISSION GUIDELINES (FCC GUIDELINES) ARE PRE-EMPTED

BY FEDERAL LAW. THE PLAINTIFFS ALLEGE THAT THEIR HANDSETS EITHER OPERATED OUTSIDE THE FCC GUIDELINES OR WERE MANUFACTURED BEFORE THE FCC GUIDELINES WENT INTO EFFECT. THE LAWSUITS ALSO ALLEGE AN INDUSTRY-WIDE CONSPIRACY TO MANIPULATE THE SCIENCE AND

TESTING AROUND EMISSION GUIDELINES.

IN SEPTEMBER 2013, DEFENDANTS IN THE CONSOLIDATED CASES MOVED TO EXCLUDE PLAINTIFFS EXPERT

EVIDENCE OF GENERAL CAUSATION ON THE BASIS OF FLAWED SCIENTIFIC METHODOLOGIES. IN MARCH 2014, DEFENDANTS FILED A SEPARATE MOTION TO

PRECLUDE PLAINTIFFS GENERAL CAUSATION TESTIMONY. IN AUGUST 2014, THE COURT GRANTED IN PART DEFENDANTS MOTION TO EXCLUDE PLAINTIFFS GENERAL CAUSATION EXPERTS. THE PLAINTIFFS

FILED AN INTERLOCUTORY APPEAL. IN DECEMBER 2014, THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA COURT OF APPEALS AGREED TO HEAR

EN BANC

DEFENDANTS INTERLOCUTORY APPEAL CHALLENGING THE STANDARD FOR EVALUATING EXPERT SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE. TRIAL COURT

PROCEEDINGS ARE STAYED PENDING RESOLUTION OF THE APPEAL.

CANADIAN CELL PHONE CLASS ACTION

NOKIA, ALONG WITH OTHER HANDSET MANUFACTURERS AND NETWORK OPERATORS, IS A DEFENDANT IN A 2013 CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT FILED IN THE SUPREME COURT OF

BRITISH COLUMBIA BY A PURPORTED CLASS OF CANADIANS WHO HAVE USED CELLULAR PHONES FOR AT LEAST 1,600 HOURS, INCLUDING A SUBCLASS OF USERS WITH BRAIN TUMORS. MICROSOFT WAS SERVED WITH THE COMPLAINT IN JUNE 2014 AND HAS BEEN SUBSTITUTED FOR THE NOKIA

DEFENDANTS. THE LITIGATION IS NOT YET ACTIVE AS SEVERAL DEFENDANTS REMAIN TO BE SERVED.

OTHER

WE ALSO ARE SUBJECT TO A VARIETY OF OTHER CLAIMS AND SUITS THAT ARISE FROM TIME TO TIME IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF OUR BUSINESS. ALTHOUGH MANAGEMENT

CURRENTLY BELIEVES THAT RESOLVING CLAIMS AGAINST US, INDIVIDUALLY OR IN AGGREGATE, WILL NOT HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, THESE MATTERS ARE SUBJECT TO INHERENT UNCERTAINTIES AND MANAGEMENTS VIEW OF

THESE MATTERS MAY CHANGE IN THE FUTURE.

AS OF JUNE 30, 2015, WE ACCRUED AGGREGATE LEGAL LIABILITIES OF $614 MILLION IN OTHER

CURRENT LIABILITIES AND $20 MILLION IN OTHER LONG-TERM LIABILITIES. WHILE WE INTEND TO DEFEND THESE MATTERS VIGOROUSLY, ADVERSE OUTCOMES THAT WE ESTIMATE COULD REACH APPROXIMATELY $1.6 BILLION IN AGGREGATE BEYOND RECORDED AMOUNTS ARE REASONABLY

POSSIBLE. WERE UNFAVORABLE FINAL OUTCOMES TO OCCUR, THERE EXISTS THE POSSIBILITY OF A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE PERIOD IN WHICH THE EFFECTS BECOME REASONABLY ESTIMABLE.

REASONABLE BASIS FOR OUR OPINION.

IN OUR OPINION, SUCH CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS PRESENT FAIRLY, IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS, THE

FINANCIAL POSITION OF MICROSOFT CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES AS OF JUNE 30, 2015 AND 2014, AND THE RESULTS OF THEIR OPERATIONS AND THEIR CASH FLOWS FOR EACH OF THE THREE YEARS IN THE PERIOD ENDED JUNE 30, 2015, IN CONFORMITY WITH

STATEMENTS; PROVIDING REASONABLE ASSURANCE THAT RECEIPTS AND EXPENDITURES OF COMPANY ASSETS ARE MADE IN ACCORDANCE WITH MANAGEMENT AUTHORIZATION; AND PROVIDING REASONABLE ASSURANCE THAT UNAUTHORIZED ACQUISITION, USE OR DISPOSITION OF COMPANY ASSETS

THAT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS WOULD BE PREVENTED OR DETECTED ON A TIMELY BASIS. BECAUSE OF ITS INHERENT LIMITATIONS, INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING IS NOT INTENDED TO PROVIDE ABSOLUTE ASSURANCE THAT A

MISSTATEMENT OF OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS WOULD BE PREVENTED OR DETECTED.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

TO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND STOCKHOLDERS OF MICROSOFT CORPORATION

REDMOND, WASHINGTON

WE HAVE AUDITED THE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING OF MICROSOFT

CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES (THE COMPANY) AS OF JUNE 30, 2015, BASED ON CRITERIA ESTABLISHED IN

INTERNAL CONTROL  INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK (2013)

ISSUED BY THE COMMITTEE OF SPONSORING ORGANIZATIONS OF THE TREADWAY

COMMISSION. THE COMPANYS MANAGEMENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR MAINTAINING EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AND FOR ITS ASSESSMENT OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, INCLUDED IN THE ACCOMPANYING

REPORT OF MANAGEMENT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING. OUR RESPONSIBILITY IS TO EXPRESS AN OPINION ON THE COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING BASED ON OUR AUDIT.

WE CONDUCTED OUR AUDIT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE STANDARDS OF THE PUBLIC COMPANY ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BOARD (UNITED STATES). THOSE STANDARDS

REQUIRE THAT WE PLAN AND PERFORM THE AUDIT TO OBTAIN REASONABLE ASSURANCE ABOUT WHETHER EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING WAS MAINTAINED IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS. OUR AUDIT INCLUDED OBTAINING AN UNDERSTANDING OF INTERNAL

CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, ASSESSING THE RISK THAT A MATERIAL WEAKNESS EXISTS, TESTING AND EVALUATING THE DESIGN AND OPERATING EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL CONTROL BASED ON THE ASSESSED RISK, AND PERFORMING SUCH OTHER PROCEDURES AS WE CONSIDERED

NECESSARY IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR AUDIT PROVIDES A REASONABLE BASIS FOR OUR OPINION.

A COMPANYS INTERNAL

CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING IS A PROCESS DESIGNED BY, OR UNDER THE SUPERVISION OF, THE COMPANYS PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE AND PRINCIPAL FINANCIAL OFFICERS, OR PERSONS PERFORMING SIMILAR FUNCTIONS, AND EFFECTED BY THE COMPANYS BOARD OF

DIRECTORS, MANAGEMENT, AND OTHER PERSONNEL TO PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING THE RELIABILITY OF FINANCIAL REPORTING AND THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR EXTERNAL PURPOSES IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING

PRINCIPLES. A COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING INCLUDES THOSE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES THAT (1) PERTAIN TO THE MAINTENANCE OF RECORDS THAT, IN REASONABLE DETAIL, ACCURATELY AND FAIRLY REFLECT THE TRANSACTIONS AND

DISPOSITIONS OF THE ASSETS OF THE COMPANY; (2) PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE THAT TRANSACTIONS ARE RECORDED AS NECESSARY TO PERMIT PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES, AND THAT RECEIPTS

AND EXPENDITURES OF THE COMPANY ARE BEING MADE ONLY IN ACCORDANCE WITH AUTHORIZATIONS OF MANAGEMENT AND DIRECTORS OF THE COMPANY; AND (3) PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING PREVENTION OR TIMELY DETECTION OF UNAUTHORIZED ACQUISITION, USE, OR

DISPOSITION OF THE COMPANYS ASSETS THAT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

BECAUSE OF THE INHERENT

LIMITATIONS OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, INCLUDING THE POSSIBILITY OF COLLUSION OR IMPROPER MANAGEMENT OVERRIDE OF CONTROLS, MATERIAL MISSTATEMENTS DUE TO ERROR OR FRAUD MAY NOT BE PREVENTED OR DETECTED ON A TIMELY BASIS. ALSO,

PROJECTIONS OF ANY EVALUATION OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING TO FUTURE PERIODS ARE SUBJECT TO THE RISK THAT THE CONTROLS MAY BECOME INADEQUATE BECAUSE OF CHANGES IN CONDITIONS, OR THAT THE DEGREE OF COMPLIANCE

WITH THE POLICIES OR PROCEDURES MAY DETERIORATE.

IN OUR OPINION, THE COMPANY MAINTAINED, IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS, EFFECTIVE INTERNAL

CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF JUNE 30, 2015, BASED ON THE CRITERIA ESTABLISHED IN

INTERNAL CONTROL  INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK (2013)

ISSUED BY THE COMMITTEE OF SPONSORING ORGANIZATIONS OF THE TREADWAY COMMISSION.

WE HAVE ALSO AUDITED, IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE STANDARDS OF THE PUBLIC COMPANY ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BOARD (UNITED STATES), THE

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AS OF AND FOR THE YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2015, OF THE COMPANY AND OUR REPORT DATED JULY 31, 2015, EXPRESSED AN UNQUALIFIED OPINION ON THOSE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.
