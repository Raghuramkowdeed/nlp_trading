GENERAL

OUR VISION

MICROSOFT IS A TECHNOLOGY COMPANY WHOSE MISSION IS TO EMPOWER EVERY PERSON AND EVERY ORGANIZATION ON THE PLANET TO ACHIEVE MORE. OUR STRATEGY IS TO BUILD BEST-IN-CLASS PLATFORMS AND PRODUCTIVITY SERVICES FOR A

MOBILE-FIRST, CLOUD-FIRST WORLD.

THE MOBILE-FIRST, CLOUD-FIRST WORLD IS TRANSFORMING THE WAY INDIVIDUALS AND ORGANIZATIONS USE AND

INTERACT WITH TECHNOLOGY. MOBILITY IS NOT FOCUSED ON ANY ONE DEVICE; IT IS CENTERED ON THE MOBILITY OF EXPERIENCES THAT, IN TURN, ARE ORCHESTRATED BY THE CLOUD. CLOUD COMPUTING AND STORAGE SOLUTIONS PROVIDE PEOPLE AND ENTERPRISES WITH VARIOUS

CAPABILITIES TO STORE AND PROCESS THEIR DATA IN THIRD-PARTY DATACENTERS. MOBILITY ENCOMPASSES THE RICH COLLECTION OF DATA, APPLICATIONS, AND SERVICES THAT ACCOMPANY OUR CUSTOMERS AS THEY MOVE FROM SETTING TO SETTING IN THEIR LIVES. WE ARE

TRANSFORMING OUR BUSINESSES TO ENABLE MICROSOFT TO LEAD THE DIRECTION OF THIS DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION, AND ENABLE OUR CUSTOMERS AND PARTNERS TO THRIVE IN THIS EVOLVING WORLD.

WHAT WE OFFER

FOUNDED IN 1975, WE OPERATE WORLDWIDE IN OVER 190 COUNTRIES. WE DEVELOP,

LICENSE, AND SUPPORT A WIDE RANGE OF SOFTWARE PRODUCTS, SERVICES, AND DEVICES THAT DELIVER NEW OPPORTUNITIES, GREATER CONVENIENCE, AND ENHANCED VALUE TO PEOPLES LIVES.

OUR PRODUCTS INCLUDE OPERATING SYSTEMS; CROSS-DEVICE PRODUCTIVITY APPLICATIONS; SERVER APPLICATIONS; BUSINESS SOLUTION APPLICATIONS; DESKTOP AND SERVER MANAGEMENT TOOLS; SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT TOOLS; VIDEO GAMES; AND

TRAINING AND CERTIFICATION OF COMPUTER SYSTEM INTEGRATORS AND DEVELOPERS. WE ALSO DESIGN, MANUFACTURE, AND SELL DEVICES, INCLUDING PCS, TABLETS, GAMING AND ENTERTAINMENT CONSOLES, PHONES, OTHER INTELLIGENT DEVICES, AND RELATED ACCESSORIES, THAT

INTEGRATE WITH OUR CLOUD-BASED OFFERINGS. WE OFFER AN ARRAY OF SERVICES, INCLUDING CLOUD-BASED SOLUTIONS THAT PROVIDE CUSTOMERS WITH SOFTWARE, SERVICES, PLATFORMS, AND CONTENT, AND WE PROVIDE SOLUTION SUPPORT AND CONSULTING SERVICES. WE ALSO DELIVER

RELEVANT ONLINE ADVERTISING TO A GLOBAL AUDIENCE.

THE AMBITIONS THAT DRIVE US

TO CARRY OUT OUR STRATEGY, OUR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS FOCUS ON THREE INTERCONNECTED AMBITIONS.



REINVENT PRODUCTIVITY AND BUSINESS PROCESSES.



BUILD THE INTELLIGENT CLOUD PLATFORM.



CREATE MORE PERSONAL COMPUTING.

REINVENT PRODUCTIVITY AND BUSINESS PROCESSES

WE BELIEVE WE CAN SIGNIFICANTLY ENHANCE THE LIVES OF OUR CUSTOMERS USING OUR BROAD PORTFOLIO OF PRODUCTIVITY, COMMUNICATION, AND INFORMATION

SERVICES THAT SPAN DEVICES AND PLATFORMS. PRODUCTIVITY WILL BE THE FIRST AND FOREMOST OBJECTIVE, TO ENABLE PEOPLE TO MEET AND COLLABORATE MORE EASILY, AND TO EFFECTIVELY EXPRESS IDEAS IN NEW WAYS. WE INVENT NEW SCENARIOS THAT IN TURN CREATE

OPPORTUNITY FOR OUR PARTNERS AND HELP BUSINESSES ACCELERATE THEIR TRANSFORMATION WHILE RESPECTING EACH PERSONS PRIVACY CHOICES. THE FOUNDATION FOR THESE EFFORTS WILL REST ON ADVANCING OUR LEADING PRODUCTIVITY, COLLABORATION, COMMUNICATION, AND

BUSINESS PROCESS TOOLS INCLUDING WORD, EXCEL, POWERPOINT, OUTLOOK, ONENOTE, ONEDRIVE, SKYPE, AND MICROSOFT DYNAMICS (DYNAMICS). WITH OFFICE 365, WE PROVIDE THESE FAMILIAR INDUSTRY-LEADING PRODUCTIVITY AND BUSINESS PROCESS TOOLS AS CLOUD

SERVICES, ENABLING ACCESS FROM ANYWHERE AND ANY DEVICE. THIS CREATES AN OPPORTUNITY TO REACH NEW CUSTOMERS AND EXPAND THE USAGE OF OUR SERVICES BY OUR EXISTING CUSTOMERS. WE SEE OPPORTUNITY IN COMBINING OUR OFFERINGS IN NEW WAYS THAT ARE

MOBILE, COLLABORATIVE, INTELLIGENT AND TRUSTWORTHY. WE OFFER OUR SERVICES ACROSS PLATFORMS AND DEVICES OUTSIDE OUR OWN. AS PEOPLE MOVE FROM DEVICE TO DEVICE, SO WILL THEIR CONTENT AND THE RICHNESS OF THEIR SERVICES. WE ENGINEER OUR APPLICATIONS SO

USERS CAN FIND, TRY, AND BUY THEM IN FRICTION-FREE WAYS.

BUILD THE INTELLIGENT CLOUD PLATFORM

IN DEPLOYING TECHNOLOGY THAT ADVANCES BUSINESS STRATEGY, ENTERPRISES DECIDE WHAT SOLUTIONS WILL MAKE EMPLOYEES MORE PRODUCTIVE, COLLABORATIVE, AND

SATISFIED, AND CONNECT WITH CUSTOMERS IN NEW AND COMPELLING WAYS. THEY WORK TO UNLOCK BUSINESS INSIGHTS FROM A WORLD OF DATA. TO ACHIEVE THESE OBJECTIVES, INCREASINGLY BUSINESSES LOOK TO LEVERAGE THE BENEFITS OF THE CLOUD. HELPING BUSINESSES MOVE TO

THE CLOUD IS ONE OF OUR LARGEST OPPORTUNITIES, AND WE BELIEVE WE WORK FROM A POSITION OF STRENGTH. MICROSOFT IS ONE OF TWO LEADERS IN THE MARKET.

THE SHIFT TO THE CLOUD IS DRIVEN BY THREE IMPORTANT ECONOMIES OF SCALE: LARGER DATACENTERS CAN DEPLOY COMPUTATIONAL RESOURCES AT SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER COST PER UNIT THAN SMALLER ONES; LARGER DATACENTERS CAN

COORDINATE AND AGGREGATE DIVERSE CUSTOMER, GEOGRAPHIC, AND APPLICATION DEMAND PATTERNS, IMPROVING THE UTILIZATION OF COMPUTING, STORAGE, AND NETWORK RESOURCES; AND MULTI-TENANCY LOWERS APPLICATION MAINTENANCE LABOR COSTS FOR LARGE PUBLIC CLOUDS. AS

ONE OF THE LARGEST PROVIDERS OF CLOUD COMPUTING AT SCALE, WE ARE WELL-POSITIONED TO HELP BUSINESSES MOVE TO THE CLOUD AND FOCUS ON INNOVATION WHILE LEAVING NON-DIFFERENTIATING ACTIVITIES TO RELIABLE AND COST-EFFECTIVE PROVIDERS LIKE MICROSOFT.

WE BELIEVE OUR SERVER PRODUCTS AND CLOUD SERVICES, WHICH INCLUDE MICROSOFT SQL SERVER (SQL SERVER), WINDOWS SERVER, VISUAL

STUDIO, SYSTEM CENTER, AND MICROSOFT AZURE (AZURE), MAKE US THE ONLY COMPANY WITH A PUBLIC, PRIVATE, AND HYBRID CLOUD PLATFORM THAT CAN POWER MODERN BUSINESS. WITH AZURE, WE ARE ONE OF VERY FEW CLOUD VENDORS THAT RUN AT A SCALE THAT

MEETS THE NEEDS OF BUSINESSES OF ALL SIZES AND COMPLEXITIES. WE ARE WORKING TO ENHANCE THE RETURN ON IT INVESTMENT BY ENABLING ENTERPRISES TO COMBINE THEIR EXISTING DATACENTERS AND OUR PUBLIC CLOUD INTO A SINGLE COHESIVE INFRASTRUCTURE. BUSINESSES

CAN DEPLOY APPLICATIONS IN THEIR OWN DATACENTER, A PARTNERS DATACENTER, OR IN OUR DATACENTERS WITH COMMON SECURITY, MANAGEMENT, AND ADMINISTRATION ACROSS ALL ENVIRONMENTS, WITH THE FLEXIBILITY AND SCALE THEY WANT.

WE ENABLE ORGANIZATIONS TO SECURELY ADOPT SOFTWARE-AS-A-SERVICE APPLICATIONS, BOTH OUR OWN AND THIRD-PARTY, AND INTEGRATE THEM WITH THEIR EXISTING

SECURITY AND MANAGEMENT INFRASTRUCTURE. WE CONTINUE TO INNOVATE WITH HIGHER-LEVEL SERVICES INCLUDING IDENTITY AND DIRECTORY SERVICES THAT MANAGE EMPLOYEE CORPORATE IDENTITY AND MANAGE AND SECURE CORPORATE INFORMATION ACCESSED AND STORED ACROSS A

GROWING NUMBER OF DEVICES, RICH DATA STORAGE AND ANALYTICS SERVICES, MACHINE LEARNING SERVICES, MEDIA SERVICES, WEB AND MOBILE BACKEND SERVICES, AND DEVELOPER PRODUCTIVITY SERVICES. TO FOSTER A RICH DEVELOPER ECOSYSTEM, OUR PLATFORM IS EXTENSIBLE,

ENABLING CUSTOMERS AND PARTNERS TO FURTHER CUSTOMIZE AND ENHANCE OUR SOLUTIONS, ACHIEVING EVEN MORE VALUE. THIS STRATEGY REQUIRES CONTINUING INVESTMENT IN DATACENTERS AND OTHER INFRASTRUCTURE TO SUPPORT OUR SERVICES.

CREATE MORE PERSONAL COMPUTING

WE STRIVE TO MAKE COMPUTING MORE PERSONAL BY PUTTING USERS AT THE CORE OF THE EXPERIENCE, ENABLING THEM TO INTERACT WITH TECHNOLOGY IN MORE INTUITIVE, ENGAGING, AND DYNAMIC WAYS. A COMPUTING DEVICE SHOULD BE NOT

JUST A TOOL, BUT A PARTNER. WINDOWS 10 IS THE CORNERSTONE OF OUR AMBITION TO USHER IN THIS ERA OF MORE PERSONAL COMPUTING. WE CONSIDER THE LAUNCH OF WINDOWS 10 IN JULY 2015 TO BE A TRANSFORMATIVE MOMENT AS WE MOVED FROM AN OPERATING SYSTEM THAT

RUNS ON A PC TO A SERVICE THAT CAN POWER THE FULL SPECTRUM OF DEVICES. WE DEVELOPED WINDOWS 10 NOT ONLY TO BE FAMILIAR TO OUR USERS, BUT MORE SAFE, SECURE, AND ALWAYS UP-TO-DATE. WINDOWS 10 IS MORE PERSONAL AND PRODUCTIVE WITH FUNCTIONALITY SUCH AS

CORTANA, WINDOWS HELLO, WINDOWS INK, MICROSOFT EDGE, AND UNIVERSAL APPLICATIONS. WINDOWS 10 IS DESIGNED TO FOSTER INNOVATION  FROM US, OUR PARTNERS, AND DEVELOPERS  THROUGH RICH AND CONSISTENT EXPERIENCES ACROSS THE RANGE OF EXISTING

DEVICES AND ENTIRELY NEW DEVICE CATEGORIES.

OUR AMBITION FOR WINDOWS 10 IS TO BROADEN OUR ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY THROUGH THREE KEY

LEVERS: AN ORIGINAL EQUIPMENT MANUFACTURER (OEM) ECOSYSTEM THAT CREATES EXCITING NEW HARDWARE DESIGNS FOR WINDOWS 10; OUR OWN COMMITMENT TO THE HEALTH AND PROFITABILITY OF OUR FIRST-PARTY PREMIUM DEVICE PORTFOLIO; AND MONETIZATION

OPPORTUNITIES SUCH AS SERVICES, SUBSCRIPTIONS, GAMING, AND SEARCH ADVERTISING. OUR OEM PARTNERS ARE INVESTING IN AN EXTENSIVE PORTFOLIO OF HARDWARE DESIGNS AND CONFIGURATIONS FOR WINDOWS 10. WE NOW HAVE THE WIDEST RANGE OF WINDOWS HARDWARE EVER

AVAILABLE.

WITH THE UNIFIED WINDOWS OPERATING SYSTEM, DEVELOPERS AND OEMS CAN CONTRIBUTE TO A THRIVING WINDOWS ECOSYSTEM. WE INVEST

HEAVILY TO MAKE WINDOWS THE MOST SECURE, MANAGEABLE, AND CAPABLE OPERATING SYSTEM FOR THE NEEDS OF A MODERN WORKFORCE. WE ARE WORKING TO CREATE A BROAD DEVELOPER OPPORTUNITY BY UNIFYING THE INSTALLED BASE TO WINDOWS 10 THROUGH UPGRADES AND ONGOING

UPDATES, AND BY ENABLING UNIVERSAL WINDOWS APPLICATIONS TO RUN ACROSS ALL DEVICE TARGETS. AS PART OF OUR STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES, WE ARE COMMITTED TO DESIGNING AND MARKETING FIRST-PARTY DEVICES TO HELP DRIVE INNOVATION, CREATE NEW CATEGORIES, AND

STIMULATE DEMAND IN THE WINDOWS ECOSYSTEM. WE ARE DEVELOPING NEW INPUT/OUTPUT METHODS WITHIN WINDOWS 10, INCLUDING SPEECH, PEN, GESTURE, AND AUGMENTED REALITY HOLOGRAMS TO POWER MORE PERSONAL COMPUTING EXPERIENCES.

OUR FUTURE OPPORTUNITY

THERE ARE SEVERAL

DISTINCT AREAS OF TECHNOLOGY THAT WE AIM TO DRIVE FORWARD. OUR GOAL IS TO LEAD THE INDUSTRY IN THESE AREAS OVER THE LONG-TERM, WHICH WE EXPECT WILL TRANSLATE TO SUSTAINED GROWTH. WE ARE INVESTING SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES IN.



DELIVERING NEW PRODUCTIVITY AND BUSINESS PROCESSES TO IMPROVE HOW PEOPLE COMMUNICATE, COLLABORATE, LEARN, WORK, PLAY, AND INTERACT WITH ONE ANOTHER.



BUILDING AND RUNNING CLOUD-BASED SERVICES IN WAYS THAT UNLEASH NEW EXPERIENCES AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR BUSINESSES AND INDIVIDUALS.



ESTABLISHING THE WINDOWS PLATFORM ACROSS SERVERS AND DEVICES, BOTH OUR OWN AND THIRD-PARTY, AND THE CLOUD TO DRIVE A THRIVING ECOSYSTEM OF DEVELOPERS, UNIFY

THE CROSS-DEVICE USER EXPERIENCE, AND INCREASE AGILITY WHEN BRINGING NEW ADVANCES TO MARKET.



DEVELOPING NEW DEVICES THAT HAVE INCREASINGLY NATURAL WAYS TO INTERACT WITH THEM, INCLUDING SPEECH, PEN, GESTURE, AND AUGMENTED REALITY HOLOGRAMS.



APPLYING MACHINE LEARNING TO MAKE TECHNOLOGY MORE INTUITIVE AND ABLE TO ACT ON OUR BEHALF TO UNDERSTAND AND INTERPRET OUR NEEDS USING NATURAL METHODS OF

COMMUNICATION.

WE BELIEVE THE BREADTH OF OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES PORTFOLIO, OUR LARGE GLOBAL PARTNER AND CUSTOMER

BASE, OUR GROWING ECOSYSTEM, AND OUR ONGOING INVESTMENT IN INNOVATION POSITION US TO BE A LEADER IN THESE AREAS AND DIFFERENTIATE OURSELVES FROM COMPETITORS.

GAMING

OUR GAMING PLATFORM IS DESIGNED TO PROVIDE A UNIQUE VARIETY OF ENTERTAINMENT THROUGH THE USE OF OUR DEVICES, PERIPHERALS, APPLICATIONS, ONLINE SERVICES, AND CONTENT. WE RELEASED XBOX 360 AND XBOX ONE IN NOVEMBER

2005 AND NOVEMBER 2013, RESPECTIVELY, AND RECENTLY ANNOUNCED XBOX ONE S WILL BE RELEASED IN AUGUST 2016. WE ALSO LAUNCHED OUR WINDOWS 10 XBOX APP IN JULY 2015. XBOX LIVE ENABLES PEOPLE TO CONNECT AND SHARE ONLINE GAMING EXPERIENCES AND IS

ACCESSIBLE ON XBOX CONSOLES, WINDOWS-ENABLED DEVICES, AND OTHER DEVICES. XBOX LIVE SERVICES CONSIST OF SUBSCRIPTIONS AND SALES OF XBOX LIVE ENABLED CONTENT, AS WELL AS ADVERTISING, AND ARE DESIGNED TO BENEFIT USERS BY PROVIDING ACCESS TO A

NETWORK OF CERTIFIED APPLICATIONS AND SERVICES AND TO BENEFIT OUR DEVELOPER AND PARTNER ECOSYSTEMS BY PROVIDING ACCESS TO A LARGE CUSTOMER BASE. WE ALSO DESIGN AND SELL GAMING CONTENT TO SHOWCASE OUR UNIQUE PLATFORM CAPABILITIES FOR XBOX CONSOLES,

WINDOWS-ENABLED DEVICES, AND OTHER DEVICES. WE ACQUIRED MOJANG SYNERGIES AB, THE SWEDISH VIDEO GAME DEVELOPER OF THE MINECRAFT GAMING FRANCHISE, IN NOVEMBER 2014. THE ADDITION OF MINECRAFT AND ITS COMMUNITY ENHANCES OUR GAMING PORTFOLIO ACROSS

WINDOWS, XBOX, AND OTHER ECOSYSTEMS BESIDES OUR OWN. WE BELIEVE THE SUCCESS OF OUR GAMING BUSINESS IS DETERMINED BY THE OVERALL ACTIVE USER BASE THROUGH XBOX LIVE ENABLED CONTENT, AVAILABILITY OF GAMES, PROVIDING EXCLUSIVE GAME CONTENT THAT GAMERS

SEEK, THE COMPUTATIONAL POWER AND RELIABILITY OF THE DEVICES USED TO ACCESS OUR CONTENT AND SERVICES, AND THE ABILITY TO CREATE NEW EXPERIENCES VIA ONLINE SERVICES, DOWNLOADABLE CONTENT, AND PERIPHERALS.

SEARCH ADVERTISING

SEARCH ADVERTISING,

INCLUDING BING AND BING ADS, IS DESIGNED TO DELIVER RELEVANT ONLINE ADVERTISING TO A GLOBAL AUDIENCE. WE HAVE SEVERAL PARTNERSHIPS WITH OTHER COMPANIES, INCLUDING YAHOO!, IN WHICH WE PROVIDE AND MONETIZE SEARCH RESULTS. GROWTH DEPENDS ON OUR ABILITY

TO ATTRACT NEW USERS, UNDERSTAND INTENT, AND MATCH INTENT WITH RELEVANT CONTENT AND ADVERTISER OFFERINGS.

COMPETITION

THE WINDOWS OPERATING SYSTEM FACES COMPETITION FROM VARIOUS SOFTWARE PRODUCTS AND FROM ALTERNATIVE PLATFORMS AND DEVICES, MAINLY FROM APPLE AND

GOOGLE. WE BELIEVE WINDOWS COMPETES EFFECTIVELY BY GIVING CUSTOMERS CHOICE, VALUE, FLEXIBILITY, SECURITY, AN EASY-TO-USE INTERFACE, AND COMPATIBILITY WITH A BROAD RANGE OF HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE APPLICATIONS, INCLUDING THOSE THAT ENABLE PRODUCTIVITY.

OUR DEVICES FACE COMPETITION FROM VARIOUS COMPUTER, TABLET, HARDWARE, AND PHONE MANUFACTURERS, AND OFFER A UNIQUE COMBINATION OF

HIGH-QUALITY INDUSTRIAL DESIGN AND INNOVATIVE TECHNOLOGIES ACROSS VARIOUS PRICE POINTS, MANY OF WHICH ARE ALSO CURRENT OR POTENTIAL PARTNERS AND CUSTOMERS. THESE MANUFACTURERS INCLUDE APPLE, AS WELL AS OUR WINDOWS OEM PARTNERS.

OUR GAMING PLATFORM COMPETES WITH CONSOLE PLATFORMS FROM SONY AND NINTENDO, BOTH OF WHICH HAVE A LARGE, ESTABLISHED BASE OF CUSTOMERS. THE

LIFECYCLE FOR GAMING AND ENTERTAINMENT CONSOLES AVERAGES FIVE TO TEN YEARS. NINTENDO RELEASED THEIR LATEST GENERATION CONSOLE IN NOVEMBER 2012. SONY RELEASED THEIR LATEST GENERATION CONSOLE IN NOVEMBER 2013.

IN ADDITION TO SONY AND NINTENDO, WE COMPETE WITH OTHER PROVIDERS OF ENTERTAINMENT SERVICES THROUGH ONLINE MARKETPLACES. WE BELIEVE OUR GAMING

PLATFORM IS EFFECTIVELY POSITIONED AGAINST COMPETITIVE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES BASED ON SIGNIFICANT INNOVATION IN HARDWARE ARCHITECTURE, USER INTERFACE, DEVELOPER TOOLS, ONLINE GAMING AND ENTERTAINMENT SERVICES, AND CONTINUED STRONG EXCLUSIVE CONTENT

FROM OUR OWN GAME FRANCHISES AS WELL AS OTHER DIGITAL CONTENT OFFERINGS. OUR VIDEO GAMES COMPETITORS INCLUDE ELECTRONIC ARTS AND ACTIVISION BLIZZARD. XBOX LIVE FACES COMPETITION FROM VARIOUS ONLINE MARKETPLACES, INCLUDING THOSE OPERATED BY AMAZON,

APPLE, AND GOOGLE.

OUR SEARCH ADVERTISING BUSINESS COMPETES WITH GOOGLE AND A WIDE ARRAY OF WEBSITES, SOCIAL PLATFORMS LIKE FACEBOOK,

AND PORTALS THAT PROVIDE CONTENT AND ONLINE OFFERINGS TO END USERS.

OPERATIONS

WE HAVE OPERATIONS CENTERS THAT SUPPORT ALL OPERATIONS IN THEIR REGIONS, INCLUDING CUSTOMER CONTRACT AND ORDER PROCESSING, CREDIT AND COLLECTIONS, INFORMATION PROCESSING, AND VENDOR MANAGEMENT AND LOGISTICS. THE

REGIONAL CENTER IN IRELAND SUPPORTS THE EUROPEAN, MIDDLE EASTERN, AND AFRICAN REGION; THE CENTER IN SINGAPORE SUPPORTS THE JAPAN, INDIA, GREATER CHINA, AND ASIA-PACIFIC REGION; AND THE CENTERS IN FARGO, NORTH DAKOTA, FORT LAUDERDALE, FLORIDA, PUERTO

RICO, REDMOND, WASHINGTON, AND RENO, NEVADA SUPPORT LATIN AMERICA AND NORTH AMERICA. IN ADDITION TO THE OPERATIONS CENTERS, WE ALSO OPERATE DATACENTERS THROUGHOUT THE AMERICAS, AUSTRALIA, EUROPE, AND ASIA.

TO SERVE THE NEEDS OF CUSTOMERS AROUND THE WORLD AND TO IMPROVE THE QUALITY AND USABILITY OF PRODUCTS IN INTERNATIONAL MARKETS, WE LOCALIZE MANY OF

OUR PRODUCTS TO REFLECT LOCAL LANGUAGES AND CONVENTIONS. LOCALIZING A PRODUCT MAY REQUIRE MODIFYING THE USER INTERFACE, ALTERING DIALOG BOXES, AND TRANSLATING TEXT.

WE OPERATE MANUFACTURING FACILITIES FOR THE PRODUCTION AND CUSTOMIZATION OF PHONES, PREDOMINANTLY IN VIETNAM. WE ANNOUNCED THE SALE OF OUR ENTRY-LEVEL FEATURE PHONE BUSINESS IN MAY 2016, WHICH INCLUDES THE SALE OF

OUR PHONE MANUFACTURING FACILITY IN VIETNAM.

OUR DEVICES, OTHER THAN PHONES, ARE PRIMARILY MANUFACTURED BY THIRD-PARTY CONTRACT

MANUFACTURERS. WE GENERALLY HAVE THE ABILITY TO USE OTHER MANUFACTURERS IF A CURRENT VENDOR BECOMES UNAVAILABLE OR UNABLE TO MEET OUR REQUIREMENTS.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

DURING FISCAL YEARS 2016, 2015, AND 2014, RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

EXPENSE WAS $12.0 BILLION, $12.0 BILLION, AND $11.4 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY. THESE AMOUNTS REPRESENTED 14%, 13%, AND 13% OF REVENUE IN FISCAL YEARS 2016, 2015, AND 2014, RESPECTIVELY. WE PLAN TO CONTINUE TO MAKE SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS IN A BROAD

RANGE OF RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS.

PRODUCT AND SERVICE DEVELOPMENT, AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

WE DEVELOP MOST OF OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES INTERNALLY THROUGH THREE ENGINEERING GROUPS.



APPLICATIONS AND SERVICES ENGINEERING GROUP

, FOCUSES ON BROAD APPLICATIONS AND SERVICES CORE TECHNOLOGIES IN PRODUCTIVITY, COMMUNICATION, EDUCATION,

SEARCH, AND OTHER INFORMATION CATEGORIES.



CLOUD AND ENTERPRISE ENGINEERING GROUP

, FOCUSES ON OUR CLOUD INFRASTRUCTURE, SERVER, DATABASE, CRM, ENTERPRISE RESOURCE PLANNING, MANAGEMENT,

DEVELOPMENT TOOLS, AND OTHER BUSINESS PROCESS APPLICATIONS AND SERVICES FOR ENTERPRISES.



WINDOWS AND DEVICES ENGINEERING GROUP

, FOCUSES ON OUR WINDOWS PLATFORM ACROSS DEVICES OF ALL TYPES, HARDWARE DEVELOPMENT OF OUR DEVICES, AND ASSOCIATED

ONLINE MARKETPLACES.

INTERNAL DEVELOPMENT ALLOWS US TO MAINTAIN COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGES THAT COME FROM PRODUCT

DIFFERENTIATION AND CLOSER TECHNICAL CONTROL OVER OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. IT ALSO GIVES US THE FREEDOM TO DECIDE WHICH MODIFICATIONS AND ENHANCEMENTS ARE MOST IMPORTANT AND WHEN THEY SHOULD BE IMPLEMENTED. WE STRIVE TO OBTAIN INFORMATION AS EARLY

AS POSSIBLE ABOUT CHANGING USAGE PATTERNS AND HARDWARE ADVANCES THAT MAY AFFECT SOFTWARE DESIGN. BEFORE RELEASING NEW SOFTWARE PLATFORMS, WE PROVIDE APPLICATION VENDORS WITH A RANGE OF RESOURCES AND GUIDELINES FOR DEVELOPMENT, TRAINING, AND TESTING.

GENERALLY, WE ALSO CREATE PRODUCT DOCUMENTATION INTERNALLY.

WE PROTECT OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY INVESTMENTS IN A VARIETY OF WAYS. WE

WORK ACTIVELY IN THE U.S. AND INTERNATIONALLY TO ENSURE THE ENFORCEMENT OF COPYRIGHT, TRADEMARK, TRADE SECRET, AND OTHER PROTECTIONS THAT APPLY TO OUR SOFTWARE AND HARDWARE PRODUCTS, SERVICES, BUSINESS PLANS, AND BRANDING. WE ARE A LEADER AMONG

TECHNOLOGY COMPANIES IN PURSUING PATENTS AND CURRENTLY HAVE A PORTFOLIO OF OVER 61,000 U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL PATENTS ISSUED AND OVER 35,000

PENDING. WHILE WE EMPLOY MUCH OF OUR INTERNALLY DEVELOPED INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY EXCLUSIVELY IN MICROSOFT PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, WE ALSO ENGAGE IN OUTBOUND AND INBOUND LICENSING OF SPECIFIC

PATENTED TECHNOLOGIES THAT ARE INCORPORATED INTO LICENSEES OR MICROSOFTS PRODUCTS. FROM TIME TO TIME, WE ENTER INTO BROADER CROSS-LICENSE AGREEMENTS WITH OTHER TECHNOLOGY COMPANIES COVERING ENTIRE GROUPS OF PATENTS. WE ALSO PURCHASE OR

LICENSE TECHNOLOGY THAT WE INCORPORATE INTO OUR PRODUCTS OR SERVICES. AT TIMES, WE MAKE SELECT INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY BROADLY AVAILABLE AT NO OR LOW COST TO ACHIEVE A STRATEGIC OBJECTIVE, SUCH AS PROMOTING INDUSTRY STANDARDS, ADVANCING

INTEROPERABILITY, OR ATTRACTING AND ENABLING OUR EXTERNAL DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY.

WHILE IT MAY BE NECESSARY IN THE FUTURE TO SEEK OR

RENEW LICENSES RELATING TO VARIOUS ASPECTS OF OUR PRODUCTS AND BUSINESS METHODS, WE BELIEVE, BASED UPON PAST EXPERIENCE AND INDUSTRY PRACTICE, SUCH LICENSES GENERALLY COULD BE OBTAINED ON COMMERCIALLY REASONABLE TERMS. WE BELIEVE OUR CONTINUING

RESEARCH AND PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT ARE NOT MATERIALLY DEPENDENT ON ANY SINGLE LICENSE OR OTHER AGREEMENT WITH A THIRD PARTY RELATING TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF OUR PRODUCTS.

INVESTING IN THE FUTURE

MICROSOFTS SUCCESS IS BASED ON OUR ABILITY TO CREATE NEW AND

COMPELLING PRODUCTS, SERVICES, AND EXPERIENCES FOR OUR USERS, TO INITIATE AND EMBRACE DISRUPTIVE TECHNOLOGY TRENDS, TO ENTER NEW GEOGRAPHIC AND PRODUCT MARKETS, AND TO DRIVE BROAD ADOPTION OF OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. WE INVEST IN A RANGE OF

EMERGING TECHNOLOGY TRENDS AND BREAKTHROUGHS THAT WE BELIEVE OFFER SIGNIFICANT OPPORTUNITIES TO DELIVER VALUE TO OUR CUSTOMERS AND GROWTH FOR THE COMPANY. BASED ON OUR ASSESSMENT OF KEY TECHNOLOGY TRENDS, WE MAINTAIN OUR LONG-TERM COMMITMENT TO

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ACROSS A WIDE SPECTRUM OF TECHNOLOGIES, TOOLS, AND PLATFORMS SPANNING DIGITAL WORK AND LIFE EXPERIENCES, CLOUD COMPUTING, AND DEVICES OPERATING SYSTEMS AND HARDWARE.

WHILE OUR MAIN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT FACILITIES ARE LOCATED IN REDMOND, WASHINGTON, WE ALSO OPERATE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT FACILITIES IN OTHER

PARTS OF THE U.S. AND AROUND THE WORLD, INCLUDING CANADA, CHINA, DENMARK, FINLAND, FRANCE, INDIA, IRELAND, ISRAEL, JAPAN, AND THE UNITED KINGDOM. THIS GLOBAL APPROACH HELPS US REMAIN COMPETITIVE IN LOCAL MARKETS AND ENABLES US TO CONTINUE TO ATTRACT

TOP TALENT FROM ACROSS THE WORLD. WE GENERALLY FUND RESEARCH AT THE CORPORATE LEVEL TO ENSURE THAT WE ARE LOOKING BEYOND IMMEDIATE PRODUCT CONSIDERATIONS TO OPPORTUNITIES FURTHER IN THE FUTURE. WE ALSO FUND RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES AT THE

BUSINESS SEGMENT LEVEL. MUCH OF OUR BUSINESS SEGMENT LEVEL RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT IS COORDINATED WITH OTHER SEGMENTS AND LEVERAGED ACROSS THE COMPANY.

IN ADDITION TO OUR MAIN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT OPERATIONS, WE ALSO OPERATE MICROSOFT RESEARCH. MICROSOFT RESEARCH IS ONE OF THE WORLDS LARGEST COMPUTER SCIENCE RESEARCH ORGANIZATIONS, AND WORKS IN CLOSE

COLLABORATION WITH TOP UNIVERSITIES AROUND THE WORLD TO ADVANCE THE STATE-OF-THE-ART IN COMPUTER SCIENCE, PROVIDING US A UNIQUE PERSPECTIVE ON FUTURE TECHNOLOGY TRENDS AND CONTRIBUTING TO OUR INNOVATION.

DISTRIBUTION, SALES, AND MARKETING

WE MARKET AND DISTRIBUTE OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES THROUGH THE FOLLOWING CHANNELS: OEMS, DISTRIBUTORS AND RESELLERS, ONLINE, AND MICROSOFT RETAIL STORES. OUR SALES FORCE PERFORMS A VARIETY OF FUNCTIONS, INCLUDING

WORKING DIRECTLY WITH ENTERPRISES AND PUBLIC SECTOR ORGANIZATIONS WORLDWIDE TO IDENTIFY AND MEET THEIR SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS; MANAGING OEM RELATIONSHIPS; AND SUPPORTING SOLUTION INTEGRATORS, INDEPENDENT SOFTWARE VENDORS, AND OTHER PARTNERS WHO

ENGAGE DIRECTLY WITH OUR CUSTOMERS TO PERFORM SALES, CONSULTING, AND FULFILLMENT FUNCTIONS FOR OUR PRODUCTS.

OEMS

WE DISTRIBUTE SOFTWARE THROUGH OEMS THAT PRE-INSTALL OUR SOFTWARE ON NEW DEVICES AND SERVERS THEY SELL. THE LARGEST COMPONENT OF THE OEM BUSINESS

IS THE WINDOWS OPERATING SYSTEM PRE-INSTALLED ON COMPUTING DEVICES. OEMS ALSO SELL HARDWARE PRE-INSTALLED WITH OTHER MICROSOFT PRODUCTS, INCLUDING SERVER AND EMBEDDED OPERATING SYSTEMS AND APPLICATIONS SUCH AS OUR MICROSOFT OFFICE SUITE. IN ADDITION

TO THESE PRODUCTS, WE ALSO MARKET OUR SERVICES THROUGH OEMS AND SERVICE BUNDLES SUCH AS WINDOWS WITH BING OR WINDOWS WITH OFFICE 365 SUBSCRIPTION.

THERE ARE TWO BROAD CATEGORIES OF OEMS. THE LARGEST OEMS, MANY OF WHICH OPERATE GLOBALLY, ARE

REFERRED TO AS DIRECT OEMS, AS OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH THEM IS MANAGED THROUGH A DIRECT AGREEMENT BETWEEN MICROSOFT AND THE OEM. WE HAVE DISTRIBUTION AGREEMENTS COVERING ONE OR MORE OF OUR PRODUCTS WITH VIRTUALLY ALL OF THE MULTINATIONAL

OEMS, INCLUDING ACER, ASUST, DELL, FUJITSU, HEWLETT-PACKARD, LENOVO, SAMSUNG, TOSHIBA, AND WITH MANY REGIONAL AND LOCAL OEMS. THE SECOND BROAD CATEGORY OF OEMS CONSISTS OF LOWER-VOLUME PC MANUFACTURERS (ALSO CALLED SYSTEM BUILDERS),

WHICH SOURCE THEIR MICROSOFT SOFTWARE FOR PRE-INSTALLATION AND LOCAL REDISTRIBUTION PRIMARILY THROUGH THE MICROSOFT DISTRIBUTOR CHANNEL RATHER THAN THROUGH A DIRECT AGREEMENT OR RELATIONSHIP WITH MICROSOFT.

DISTRIBUTORS AND RESELLERS

MANY

ORGANIZATIONS THAT LICENSE OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES THROUGH ENTERPRISE AGREEMENTS TRANSACT DIRECTLY WITH US, WITH SALES SUPPORT FROM SOLUTION INTEGRATORS, INDEPENDENT SOFTWARE VENDORS, WEB AGENCIES, AND DEVELOPERS THAT ADVISE ORGANIZATIONS ON

LICENSING OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES (ENTERPRISE AGREEMENT SOFTWARE ADVISORS, OR ESAS). ORGANIZATIONS ALSO LICENSE OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES INDIRECTLY, PRIMARILY THROUGH LICENSING SOLUTION PARTNERS (LSPS),

DISTRIBUTORS, VALUE-ADDED RESELLERS (VARS), OEMS, SYSTEM BUILDER CHANNELS, AND RETAILERS. ALTHOUGH EACH TYPE OF RESELLING PARTNER REACHES ORGANIZATIONS OF ALL SIZES, LSPS ARE PRIMARILY ENGAGED WITH LARGE ORGANIZATIONS, DISTRIBUTORS

RESELL PRIMARILY TO VARS, AND VARS TYPICALLY REACH SMALL- AND MEDIUM-SIZED ORGANIZATIONS. ESAS TYPICALLY ARE ALSO AUTHORIZED AS LSPS AND OPERATE AS RESELLERS FOR OUR OTHER LICENSING PROGRAMS, SUCH AS THE SELECT PLUS AND OPEN LICENSING PROGRAMS

DISCUSSED UNDER LICENSING OPTIONS BELOW. SOME OF OUR DISTRIBUTORS INCLUDE INGRAM MICRO AND TECH DATA, AND SOME OF OUR LARGEST RESELLERS INCLUDE CDW, DELL, INSIGHT ENTERPRISES, AND SOFTWARE HOUSE INTERNATIONAL.

OUR DYNAMICS SOFTWARE OFFERINGS ARE ALSO LICENSED TO ENTERPRISES THROUGH A GLOBAL NETWORK OF CHANNEL PARTNERS PROVIDING VERTICAL SOLUTIONS AND

SPECIALIZED SERVICES. WE DISTRIBUTE OUR RETAIL PACKAGED PRODUCTS PRIMARILY THROUGH INDEPENDENT NON-EXCLUSIVE DISTRIBUTORS, AUTHORIZED REPLICATORS, RESELLERS, AND RETAIL OUTLETS. INDIVIDUAL CONSUMERS OBTAIN THESE PRODUCTS PRIMARILY THROUGH RETAIL

OUTLETS, INCLUDING MICROSOFT RETAIL STORES. WE DISTRIBUTE OUR DEVICES THROUGH THIRD-PARTY RETAILERS AND MICROSOFT RETAIL STORES. OUR PHONES ARE ALSO DISTRIBUTED THROUGH GLOBAL WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS CARRIERS. WE HAVE A NETWORK OF FIELD SALES

REPRESENTATIVES AND FIELD SUPPORT PERSONNEL THAT SOLICIT ORDERS FROM DISTRIBUTORS AND RESELLERS, AND PROVIDE PRODUCT TRAINING AND SALES SUPPORT.

ONLINE

ALTHOUGH ON-PREMISES SOFTWARE

CONTINUES TO BE AN IMPORTANT PART OF OUR BUSINESS, INCREASINGLY WE ARE DELIVERING ADDITIONAL VALUE TO CUSTOMERS THROUGH CLOUD-BASED SERVICES. WE PROVIDE COMMERCIAL CLOUD-BASED SOLUTIONS SUCH AS OFFICE 365, AZURE, AND DYNAMICS CRM ONLINE. WE ALSO

PROVIDE ONLINE CONTENT SERVICES TO CONSUMERS THROUGH BING, MSN PORTALS AND CHANNELS, OFFICE 365, XBOX LIVE, OUTLOOK.COM, ONEDRIVE, SKYPE, AND WINDOWS STORE. OTHER SERVICES DELIVERED ONLINE INCLUDE OUR ONLINE ADVERTISING PLATFORM WITH OFFERINGS FOR

ADVERTISERS AND PUBLISHERS, AS WELL AS MICROSOFT DEVELOPER NETWORK SUBSCRIPTION CONTENT AND UPDATES, PERIODIC PRODUCT UPDATES, AND ONLINE TECHNICAL AND PRACTICE READINESS RESOURCES TO SUPPORT OUR PARTNERS IN DEVELOPING AND SELLING OUR PRODUCTS AND

SOLUTIONS. AS WE INCREASINGLY DELIVER ONLINE SERVICES, WE SELL MANY OF THESE CLOUD-BASED SERVICES THROUGH OUR ENTERPRISE AGREEMENTS AND HAVE ALSO ENABLED NEW SALES PROGRAMS TO REACH SMALL AND MEDIUM-SIZED BUSINESSES. THESE PROGRAMS INCLUDE

DIRECT SALES, DIRECT SALES SUPPORTED BY A LARGE NETWORK OF PARTNER ADVISORS, AND RESALE OF SERVICES THROUGH OPERATOR CHANNELS, SUCH AS TELEPHONE, CELL, AND CABLE PROVIDERS.

WE ALSO SELL OUR PRODUCTS THROUGH OUR MICROSOFT RETAIL STORES AND ONLINE MARKETPLACES.

LICENSING

OPTIONS

WE LICENSE SOFTWARE TO ORGANIZATIONS UNDER AGREEMENTS THAT ALLOW THE CUSTOMER TO ACQUIRE MULTIPLE LICENSES OF PRODUCTS AND

SERVICES. OUR AGREEMENTS FOR ORGANIZATIONS TO ACQUIRE MULTIPLE LICENSES OF PRODUCTS AND SERVICES ARE DESIGNED TO PROVIDE THEM WITH A MEANS OF DOING SO WITHOUT HAVING TO ACQUIRE SEPARATE LICENSES THROUGH RETAIL CHANNELS. IN DELIVERING ORGANIZATIONAL

LICENSING AGREEMENTS TO THE MARKET, WE USE DIFFERENT PROGRAMS DESIGNED TO PROVIDE FLEXIBILITY FOR ORGANIZATIONS OF VARIOUS SIZES. WHILE THESE PROGRAMS MAY DIFFER IN VARIOUS PARTS OF THE WORLD, GENERALLY THEY INCLUDE THOSE DISCUSSED BELOW.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS

OUR OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL RESULTS ARE SUBJECT TO VARIOUS RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES, INCLUDING THOSE DESCRIBED BELOW, THAT COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, CASH

FLOWS, AND THE TRADING PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK.

WE FACE INTENSE COMPETITION ACROSS ALL MARKETS FOR OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, WHICH MAY LEAD TO

LOWER REVENUE OR OPERATING MARGINS.

COMPETITION IN THE TECHNOLOGY SECTOR

OUR COMPETITORS RANGE IN SIZE FROM DIVERSIFIED GLOBAL COMPANIES WITH SIGNIFICANT RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT RESOURCES TO SMALL, SPECIALIZED FIRMS

WHOSE NARROWER PRODUCT LINES MAY LET THEM BE MORE EFFECTIVE IN DEPLOYING TECHNICAL, MARKETING, AND FINANCIAL RESOURCES. BARRIERS TO ENTRY IN MANY OF OUR BUSINESSES ARE LOW AND MANY OF THE AREAS IN WHICH WE COMPETE EVOLVE RAPIDLY WITH CHANGING AND

DISRUPTIVE TECHNOLOGIES, SHIFTING USER NEEDS, AND FREQUENT INTRODUCTIONS OF NEW PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. OUR ABILITY TO REMAIN COMPETITIVE DEPENDS ON OUR SUCCESS IN MAKING INNOVATIVE PRODUCTS, DEVICES, AND SERVICES THAT APPEAL TO BUSINESSES AND

CONSUMERS.

COMPETITION AMONG PLATFORMS, ECOSYSTEMS, AND DEVICES

AN IMPORTANT ELEMENT OF OUR BUSINESS MODEL HAS BEEN TO CREATE PLATFORM-BASED ECOSYSTEMS ON WHICH MANY PARTICIPANTS CAN BUILD DIVERSE SOLUTIONS. A WELL-ESTABLISHED ECOSYSTEM CREATES BENEFICIAL NETWORK EFFECTS AMONG

USERS, APPLICATION DEVELOPERS, AND THE PLATFORM PROVIDER THAT CAN ACCELERATE GROWTH. ESTABLISHING SIGNIFICANT SCALE IN THE MARKETPLACE IS NECESSARY TO ACHIEVE AND MAINTAIN ATTRACTIVE MARGINS. WE FACE SIGNIFICANT COMPETITION FROM FIRMS THAT PROVIDE

COMPETING PLATFORMS, APPLICATIONS, AND SERVICES.



A COMPETING VERTICALLY-INTEGRATED MODEL, IN WHICH A SINGLE FIRM CONTROLS THE SOFTWARE AND HARDWARE ELEMENTS OF A PRODUCT AND RELATED SERVICES, HAS SUCCEEDED

WITH SOME CONSUMER PRODUCTS SUCH AS PERSONAL COMPUTERS, TABLETS, PHONES, GAMING CONSOLES, AND WEARABLES. COMPETITORS PURSUING THIS MODEL ALSO EARN REVENUE FROM SERVICES INTEGRATED WITH THE HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE PLATFORM. WE ALSO OFFER SOME

VERTICALLY-INTEGRATED HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. TO THE EXTENT WE SHIFT A PORTION OF OUR BUSINESS TO A VERTICALLY INTEGRATED MODEL WE INCREASE OUR COST OF REVENUE AND REDUCE OUR OPERATING MARGINS.



WE DERIVE SUBSTANTIAL REVENUE FROM LICENSES OF WINDOWS OPERATING SYSTEMS ON PERSONAL COMPUTERS. WE FACE SIGNIFICANT COMPETITION FROM COMPETING PLATFORMS

DEVELOPED FOR NEW DEVICES AND FORM FACTORS SUCH AS SMARTPHONES AND TABLET COMPUTERS. THESE DEVICES COMPETE ON MULTIPLE BASES INCLUDING PRICE AND THE PERCEIVED UTILITY OF THE DEVICE AND ITS PLATFORM. USERS ARE INCREASINGLY TURNING TO THESE DEVICES TO

PERFORM FUNCTIONS THAT IN THE PAST WERE PERFORMED BY PERSONAL COMPUTERS. EVEN IF MANY USERS VIEW THESE DEVICES AS COMPLEMENTARY TO A PERSONAL COMPUTER, THE PREVALENCE OF THESE DEVICES MAY MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT TO

ATTRACT APPLICATION DEVELOPERS TO OUR PC OPERATING SYSTEM PLATFORMS. COMPETING WITH OPERATING SYSTEMS LICENSED AT LOW OR NO COST MAY DECREASE OUR PC OPERATING SYSTEM MARGINS. IN ADDITION, SOME OF

OUR DEVICES COMPETE WITH PRODUCTS MADE BY OUR OEM PARTNERS, WHICH MAY AFFECT THEIR COMMITMENT TO OUR PLATFORM.



COMPETING PLATFORMS HAVE APPLICATION MARKETPLACES (SOMETIMES REFERRED TO AS STORES) WITH SCALE AND SIGNIFICANT INSTALLED BASES. THE VARIETY AND

UTILITY OF APPLICATIONS AVAILABLE ON A PLATFORM ARE IMPORTANT TO DEVICE PURCHASING DECISIONS. USERS INCUR COSTS TO MOVE DATA AND BUY NEW APPLICATIONS WHEN SWITCHING PLATFORMS. TO COMPETE, WE MUST SUCCESSFULLY ENLIST DEVELOPERS TO WRITE

APPLICATIONS FOR OUR MARKETPLACE AND ENSURE THAT THESE APPLICATIONS HAVE HIGH QUALITY, CUSTOMER APPEAL, AND VALUE. EFFORTS TO COMPETE WITH COMPETITORS APPLICATION MARKETPLACES MAY INCREASE OUR COST OF REVENUE AND LOWER OUR OPERATING MARGINS.

BUSINESS MODEL COMPETITION

COMPANIES COMPETE WITH US BASED ON A GROWING VARIETY OF BUSINESS MODELS.



EVEN AS WE TRANSITION TO A MOBILE-FIRST AND CLOUD-FIRST STRATEGY, THE LICENSE-BASED PROPRIETARY SOFTWARE MODEL GENERATES MOST OF OUR SOFTWARE REVENUE. WE BEAR

THE COSTS OF CONVERTING ORIGINAL IDEAS INTO SOFTWARE PRODUCTS THROUGH INVESTMENTS IN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, OFFSETTING THESE COSTS WITH THE REVENUE RECEIVED FROM LICENSING OUR PRODUCTS. MANY OF OUR COMPETITORS ALSO DEVELOP AND SELL SOFTWARE TO

BUSINESSES AND CONSUMERS UNDER THIS MODEL.



OTHER COMPETITORS DEVELOP AND OFFER FREE APPLICATIONS, ONLINE SERVICES AND CONTENT, AND MAKE MONEY BY SELLING THIRD-PARTY ADVERTISING. ADVERTISING REVENUE

FUNDS DEVELOPMENT OF PRODUCTS AND SERVICES THESE COMPETITORS PROVIDE TO USERS AT NO OR LITTLE COST, COMPETING DIRECTLY WITH OUR REVENUE-GENERATING PRODUCTS.



SOME COMPANIES COMPETE WITH US USING AN OPEN SOURCE BUSINESS MODEL BY MODIFYING AND THEN DISTRIBUTING OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE AT NOMINAL COST TO END-USERS, AND

EARNING REVENUE ON ADVERTISING OR COMPLEMENTARY SERVICES AND PRODUCTS. THESE FIRMS DO NOT BEAR THE FULL COSTS OF RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT FOR THE SOFTWARE. SOME OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE VENDORS DEVELOP SOFTWARE THAT MIMICS THE FEATURES AND FUNCTIONALITY

OF OUR PRODUCTS.

THE COMPETITIVE PRESSURES DESCRIBED ABOVE MAY CAUSE DECREASED SALES VOLUMES, PRICE REDUCTIONS,

AND/OR INCREASED OPERATING COSTS, SUCH AS FOR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, MARKETING, AND SALES INCENTIVES. THIS MAY LEAD TO LOWER REVENUE, GROSS MARGINS, AND OPERATING INCOME.

OUR INCREASING FOCUS ON SERVICES PRESENTS EXECUTION AND COMPETITIVE RISKS.

A GROWING PART OF OUR BUSINESS INVOLVES CLOUD-BASED SERVICES AVAILABLE ACROSS THE SPECTRUM OF COMPUTING

DEVICES. OUR STRATEGIC VISION IS TO COMPETE AND GROW AS A PRODUCTIVITY AND PLATFORM COMPANY FOR THE MOBILE-FIRST AND CLOUD-FIRST WORLD. AT THE SAME TIME, OUR COMPETITORS ARE RAPIDLY DEVELOPING AND DEPLOYING CLOUD-BASED SERVICES FOR CONSUMERS AND

BUSINESS CUSTOMERS. PRICING AND DELIVERY MODELS ARE EVOLVING. DEVICES AND FORM FACTORS INFLUENCE HOW USERS ACCESS SERVICES IN THE CLOUD AND SOMETIMES THE USERS CHOICE OF WHICH SUITE OF CLOUD-BASED SERVICES TO USE. WE ARE DEVOTING SIGNIFICANT

RESOURCES TO DEVELOP AND DEPLOY OUR CLOUD-BASED STRATEGIES. THE WINDOWS ECOSYSTEM MUST CONTINUE TO EVOLVE WITH THIS CHANGING ENVIRONMENT. WE ARE UNDERTAKING CULTURAL AND ORGANIZATIONAL CHANGES TO DRIVE ACCOUNTABILITY AND ELIMINATE OBSTACLES TO

INNOVATION. THE COMPANYS INCREASING RELIANCE ON DATA-DRIVEN INSIGHTS IS BECOMING MORE IMPORTANT TO THE SUCCESS OF KEY OPPORTUNITIES IN MONETIZATION, CUSTOMER PERCEPTIONS OF QUALITY, AND OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCY. BESIDES SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT

COSTS, WE ARE INCURRING COSTS TO BUILD AND MAINTAIN INFRASTRUCTURE TO SUPPORT CLOUD COMPUTING SERVICES. THESE COSTS WILL REDUCE THE OPERATING MARGINS WE HAVE PREVIOUSLY ACHIEVED. WHETHER WE SUCCEED IN CLOUD-BASED SERVICES DEPENDS ON OUR EXECUTION IN

SEVERAL AREAS, INCLUDING.



CONTINUING TO BRING TO MARKET COMPELLING CLOUD-BASED EXPERIENCES THAT GENERATE INCREASING TRAFFIC AND MARKET SHARE.



MAINTAINING THE UTILITY, COMPATIBILITY, AND PERFORMANCE OF OUR CLOUD-BASED SERVICES ON THE GROWING ARRAY OF COMPUTING DEVICES, INCLUDING PCS, SMARTPHONES,

TABLETS, GAMING CONSOLES, AND OTHER TELEVISION-RELATED DEVICES.



CONTINUING TO ENHANCE THE ATTRACTIVENESS OF OUR CLOUD PLATFORMS TO THIRD-PARTY DEVELOPERS.

MAKING OUR SUITE OF CLOUD-BASED SERVICES PLATFORM-AGNOSTIC, AVAILABLE ON A WIDE RANGE OF DEVICES AND ECOSYSTEMS, INCLUDING THOSE OF OUR COMPETITORS.

IT IS UNCERTAIN WHETHER OUR STRATEGIES WILL ATTRACT THE USERS OR GENERATE THE REVENUE REQUIRED TO SUCCEED. IF WE ARE

NOT EFFECTIVE IN EXECUTING ORGANIZATIONAL AND TECHNICAL CHANGES TO INCREASE EFFICIENCY AND ACCELERATE INNOVATION, OR IF WE FAIL TO GENERATE SUFFICIENT USAGE OF OUR NEW PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, WE MAY NOT GROW REVENUE IN LINE WITH THE INFRASTRUCTURE

AND DEVELOPMENT INVESTMENTS DESCRIBED ABOVE. THIS MAY NEGATIVELY IMPACT GROSS MARGINS AND OPERATING INCOME.

WE MAKE SIGNIFICANT

INVESTMENTS IN NEW PRODUCTS AND SERVICES THAT MAY NOT ACHIEVE EXPECTED RETURNS.

WE WILL CONTINUE TO MAKE SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS IN RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT, AND MARKETING FOR EXISTING PRODUCTS, SERVICES, AND TECHNOLOGIES,

INCLUDING THE WINDOWS OPERATING SYSTEM, THE MICROSOFT OFFICE SYSTEM, BING, WINDOWS PHONE, WINDOWS SERVER, THE WINDOWS STORE, THE MICROSOFT AZURE SERVICES PLATFORM, OFFICE 365, OTHER CLOUD-BASED OFFERINGS, AND THE XBOX ENTERTAINMENT PLATFORM. WE ALSO

INVEST IN THE DEVELOPMENT AND ACQUISITION OF A VARIETY OF HARDWARE FOR PRODUCTIVITY, COMMUNICATION, AND ENTERTAINMENT INCLUDING PCS, TABLETS, PHONES, AND GAMING DEVICES. INVESTMENTS IN NEW TECHNOLOGY ARE SPECULATIVE. COMMERCIAL SUCCESS DEPENDS ON

MANY FACTORS, INCLUDING INNOVATIVENESS, DEVELOPER SUPPORT, AND EFFECTIVE DISTRIBUTION AND MARKETING. IF CUSTOMERS DO NOT PERCEIVE OUR LATEST OFFERINGS AS PROVIDING SIGNIFICANT NEW FUNCTIONALITY OR OTHER VALUE, THEY MAY REDUCE THEIR PURCHASES OF NEW

SOFTWARE AND HARDWARE PRODUCTS OR UPGRADES, UNFAVORABLY AFFECTING REVENUE. WE MAY NOT ACHIEVE SIGNIFICANT REVENUE FROM NEW PRODUCT, SERVICE, AND DISTRIBUTION CHANNEL INVESTMENTS FOR SEVERAL YEARS, IF AT ALL. NEW PRODUCTS AND SERVICES MAY NOT BE

PROFITABLE, AND EVEN IF THEY ARE PROFITABLE, OPERATING MARGINS FOR SOME NEW PRODUCTS AND BUSINESSES WILL NOT BE AS HIGH AS THE MARGINS WE HAVE EXPERIENCED HISTORICALLY.

THE LAUNCH OF WINDOWS 10, WITH FREE UPGRADES AVAILABLE TO EXISTING USERS OF WINDOWS 7 AND 8.1, CONSTITUTES THE MOST AMBITIOUS UPDATE EFFORT WE HAVE EVER UNDERTAKEN. WE HAVE DONE EXTENSIVE PREPARATION AND

COMPATIBILITY TESTING FOR APPLICATIONS AND DEVICES TO HELP ENSURE A POSITIVE EXPERIENCE FOR OUR USERS INSTALLING WINDOWS 10. HOWEVER, IF USERS HAVE A NEGATIVE UPGRADE EXPERIENCE, OR THE COMMUNITY REACTS NEGATIVELY TO THE PROCESS WE ARE FOLLOWING TO

PROMOTE AND UNDERTAKE THE UPGRADES, THE RECEPTION OF WINDOWS 10 IN THE MARKETPLACE MAY BE HARMED, AND CUSTOMERS OR GOVERNMENT AGENCIES MAY BRING LITIGATION OR REGULATORY ACTIONS. IN ADDITION, WE ANTICIPATE THAT WINDOWS 10 WILL ENABLE

NEW POST-LICENSE MONETIZATION OPPORTUNITIES BEYOND INITIAL LICENSE REVENUES. OUR FAILURE TO REALIZE THESE OPPORTUNITIES TO THE EXTENT WE EXPECT COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR REVENUES. FINALLY, OUR PRACTICES AROUND DATA COLLECTION, USE,

AND MANAGEMENT IN WINDOWS 10 COULD RESULT IN REGULATORY REVIEW AND DECISIONS DIRECTING US TO CHANGE THESE PRACTICES AND IMPOSING FINES. IF SO, WE COULD FACE NEGATIVE PUBLIC REACTION, DEGRADED USER EXPERIENCES, AND REDUCED FLEXIBILITY IN PRODUCT

DESIGN.

DEVELOPING NEW TECHNOLOGIES IS COMPLEX. IT CAN REQUIRE LONG DEVELOPMENT AND TESTING PERIODS. SIGNIFICANT DELAYS IN NEW RELEASES

OR SIGNIFICANT PROBLEMS IN CREATING NEW PRODUCTS OR SERVICES COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR REVENUE.

ACQUISITIONS, JOINT VENTURES, AND

STRATEGIC ALLIANCES MAY HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS.

WE EXPECT TO CONTINUE MAKING ACQUISITIONS AND ENTERING INTO JOINT VENTURES AND STRATEGIC ALLIANCES AS PART OF OUR LONG-TERM BUSINESS STRATEGY. IN JUNE 2016,

WE ANNOUNCED OUR ACQUISITION OF LINKEDIN FOR APPROXIMATELY $26.2 BILLION. THE LINKEDIN ACQUISITION AND OTHER TRANSACTIONS AND ARRANGEMENTS INVOLVE SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES AND RISKS, INCLUDING THAT THEY DO NOT ADVANCE OUR BUSINESS STRATEGY, THAT WE

GET AN UNSATISFACTORY RETURN ON OUR INVESTMENT, THAT WE HAVE DIFFICULTY INTEGRATING NEW EMPLOYEES, BUSINESS SYSTEMS, AND TECHNOLOGY, OR THAT THEY DISTRACT MANAGEMENT FROM OUR OTHER BUSINESSES. IF AN ARRANGEMENT FAILS TO ADEQUATELY ANTICIPATE

CHANGING CIRCUMSTANCES AND INTERESTS OF A PARTY, IT MAY RESULT IN EARLY TERMINATION OR RENEGOTIATION OF THE ARRANGEMENT. THE SUCCESS OF THESE TRANSACTIONS AND ARRANGEMENTS WILL DEPEND IN PART ON OUR ABILITY TO LEVERAGE THEM TO ENHANCE OUR EXISTING

PRODUCTS AND SERVICES OR DEVELOP COMPELLING NEW ONES. IT MAY TAKE LONGER THAN EXPECTED TO REALIZE THE FULL BENEFITS FROM THESE TRANSACTIONS AND ARRANGEMENTS, SUCH AS INCREASED REVENUE, ENHANCED EFFICIENCIES, OR INCREASED MARKET SHARE, OR THE

BENEFITS MAY ULTIMATELY BE SMALLER THAN WE EXPECTED. THESE EVENTS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR OPERATING RESULTS OR FINANCIAL CONDITION.

IF OUR GOODWILL OR AMORTIZABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS BECOME IMPAIRED, WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO RECORD

A SIGNIFICANT CHARGE TO EARNINGS.

WE ACQUIRE OTHER COMPANIES AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND MAY NOT REALIZE ALL THE ECONOMIC BENEFIT FROM THOSE ACQUISITIONS, WHICH COULD CAUSE AN IMPAIRMENT OF GOODWILL OR INTANGIBLES. WE REVIEW

OUR AMORTIZABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS FOR IMPAIRMENT WHEN EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THE CARRYING VALUE MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE. WE TEST GOODWILL FOR IMPAIRMENT AT LEAST ANNUALLY. FACTORS THAT MAY BE A CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES, INDICATING

THAT THE CARRYING VALUE OF OUR GOODWILL OR AMORTIZABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE, INCLUDE A DECLINE IN OUR STOCK PRICE AND MARKET CAPITALIZATION, REDUCED FUTURE CASH FLOW ESTIMATES, AND SLOWER GROWTH RATES IN INDUSTRY SEGMENTS IN

WHICH WE PARTICIPATE. WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO RECORD A SIGNIFICANT CHARGE ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS DURING THE PERIOD IN WHICH ANY IMPAIRMENT OF OUR GOODWILL OR AMORTIZABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS IS DETERMINED, NEGATIVELY AFFECTING OUR

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. FOR EXAMPLE, IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF FISCAL YEAR 2015, WE RECORDED A $5.1 BILLION CHARGE FOR THE IMPAIRMENT OF GOODWILL AND A $2.2 BILLION CHARGE FOR THE IMPAIRMENT OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS, AND IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF FISCAL

YEAR 2016 WE RECORDED A $480 MILLION CHARGE FOR THE IMPAIRMENT OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS. THE IMPAIRMENT CHARGES FOR BOTH PERIODS RELATED TO OUR PHONE BUSINESS. OUR ACQUISITION OF LINKEDIN WILL RESULT IN A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN OUR GOODWILL AND

INTANGIBLE ASSET BALANCES.

WE MAY NOT EARN THE REVENUES WE EXPECT FROM OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS.

WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO ADEQUATELY PROTECT OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS

PROTECTING OUR GLOBAL INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS AND COMBATING UNLICENSED COPYING AND USE OF OUR SOFTWARE AND OTHER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY IS DIFFICULT. WHILE PIRACY ADVERSELY AFFECTS U.S. REVENUE, THE IMPACT ON

REVENUE FROM OUTSIDE THE U.S. IS MORE SIGNIFICANT, PARTICULARLY IN COUNTRIES WHERE LAWS ARE LESS PROTECTIVE OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS. OUR REVENUE IN THESE MARKETS MAY GROW SLOWER THAN THE UNDERLYING DEVICE MARKET. SIMILARLY, THE ABSENCE OF

HARMONIZED PATENT LAWS MAKES IT MORE DIFFICULT TO ENSURE CONSISTENT RESPECT FOR PATENT RIGHTS. THROUGHOUT THE WORLD, WE EDUCATE CONSUMERS ABOUT THE BENEFITS OF LICENSING GENUINE PRODUCTS AND OBTAINING INDEMNIFICATION BENEFITS FOR INTELLECTUAL

PROPERTY RISKS, AND WE EDUCATE LAWMAKERS ABOUT THE ADVANTAGES OF A BUSINESS CLIMATE WHERE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS ARE PROTECTED. REDUCTIONS IN THE LEGAL PROTECTION FOR SOFTWARE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT REVENUE.

WE MAY NOT RECEIVE EXPECTED ROYALTIES FROM OUR PATENT LICENSES

WE EXPEND SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES TO PATENT THE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY WE CREATE WITH THE EXPECTATION THAT WE WILL GENERATE REVENUES BY INCORPORATING THAT INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY IN OUR PRODUCTS OR SERVICES OR, IN SOME

INSTANCES, BY LICENSING OUR PATENTS TO OTHERS IN RETURN FOR A ROYALTY. CHANGES IN THE LAW MAY WEAKEN OUR ABILITY TO PREVENT THE USE OF PATENTED TECHNOLOGY OR COLLECT REVENUE FOR LICENSING OUR PATENTS. THESE INCLUDE LEGISLATIVE CHANGES AND

REGULATORY ACTIONS THAT MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT TO OBTAIN INJUNCTIONS, AND THE INCREASING USE OF LEGAL PROCESS TO CHALLENGE ISSUED PATENTS. SIMILARLY, LICENSEES OF OUR PATENTS MAY FAIL TO SATISFY THEIR OBLIGATIONS TO PAY US ROYALTIES, OR MAY CONTEST

THE SCOPE AND EXTENT OF THEIR OBLIGATIONS. FINALLY, THE ROYALTIES WE CAN OBTAIN TO MONETIZE OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY MAY DECLINE BECAUSE OF THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNOLOGY, SELLING PRICE CHANGES IN PRODUCTS USING LICENSED PATENTS, OR THE DIFFICULTY OF

DISCOVERING INFRINGEMENTS.

THIRD PARTIES MAY CLAIM WE INFRINGE THEIR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS.

FROM

TIME TO TIME, OTHERS CLAIM WE INFRINGE THEIR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS. THE NUMBER OF THESE CLAIMS MAY GROW BECAUSE OF CONSTANT TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE IN THE MARKETS IN WHICH WE COMPETE, THE EXTENSIVE PATENT COVERAGE OF EXISTING TECHNOLOGIES, THE

RAPID RATE OF ISSUANCE OF NEW PATENTS, AND OUR OFFERING OF FIRST-PARTY DEVICES, SUCH AS SURFACE AND LUMIA PHONES. TO RESOLVE THESE CLAIMS, WE MAY ENTER INTO ROYALTY AND LICENSING AGREEMENTS ON TERMS THAT ARE LESS FAVORABLE THAN CURRENTLY AVAILABLE,

STOP SELLING OR REDESIGN AFFECTED PRODUCTS OR SERVICES, OR PAY DAMAGES TO SATISFY INDEMNIFICATION COMMITMENTS WITH OUR CUSTOMERS. THESE OUTCOMES MAY CAUSE OPERATING MARGINS TO DECLINE. BESIDES MONEY DAMAGES, IN SOME JURISDICTIONS PLAINTIFFS CAN SEEK

INJUNCTIVE RELIEF THAT MAY LIMIT OR PREVENT IMPORTING, MARKETING, AND SELLING OUR PRODUCTS OR SERVICES THAT HAVE INFRINGING TECHNOLOGIES. IN SOME COUNTRIES, SUCH AS GERMANY, AN INJUNCTION CAN BE ISSUED BEFORE THE PARTIES HAVE FULLY LITIGATED THE

VALIDITY OF THE UNDERLYING PATENTS. WE HAVE PAID SIGNIFICANT AMOUNTS TO SETTLE CLAIMS RELATED TO THE USE OF TECHNOLOGY AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS AND TO PROCURE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS AS PART OF OUR STRATEGY TO MANAGE THIS RISK, AND MAY

CONTINUE TO DO SO.

WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO PROTECT OUR SOURCE CODE FROM COPYING IF THERE IS AN UNAUTHORIZED

DISCLOSURE OF SOURCE CODE.

SOURCE CODE, THE DETAILED PROGRAM COMMANDS FOR OUR OPERATING SYSTEMS AND OTHER SOFTWARE PROGRAMS, IS CRITICAL TO OUR BUSINESS. ALTHOUGH WE LICENSE PORTIONS OF OUR APPLICATION AND OPERATING SYSTEM

SOURCE CODE TO SEVERAL LICENSEES, WE TAKE SIGNIFICANT MEASURES TO PROTECT THE SECRECY OF LARGE PORTIONS OF OUR SOURCE CODE. IF A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR SOURCE CODE LEAKS, WE MIGHT LOSE FUTURE TRADE SECRET PROTECTION FOR THAT SOURCE CODE. IT MAY

BECOME EASIER FOR THIRD PARTIES TO COMPETE WITH OUR PRODUCTS BY COPYING FUNCTIONALITY, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR REVENUE AND OPERATING MARGINS. UNAUTHORIZED DISCLOSURE OF SOURCE CODE ALSO COULD INCREASE THE SECURITY RISKS DESCRIBED IN THE

NEXT PARAGRAPH.

CYBER-ATTACKS AND SECURITY VULNERABILITIES COULD LEAD TO REDUCED REVENUE, INCREASED COSTS, LIABILITY CLAIMS, OR HARM TO OUR

COMPETITIVE POSITION.

SECURITY OF MICROSOFTS INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY

THREATS TO IT SECURITY CAN TAKE A VARIETY OF FORMS. INDIVIDUAL AND GROUPS OF HACKERS, AND SOPHISTICATED ORGANIZATIONS INCLUDING STATE-SPONSORED

ORGANIZATIONS OR NATION-STATES THEMSELVES, MAY TAKE STEPS THAT POSE THREATS TO OUR CUSTOMERS AND OUR IT. THESE ACTORS MAY USE A WIDE VARIETY OF METHODS, WHICH MAY INCLUDE DEVELOPING AND DEPLOYING MALICIOUS SOFTWARE TO ATTACK OUR PRODUCTS AND

SERVICES AND GAIN ACCESS TO OUR NETWORKS AND DATACENTERS, USING SOCIAL ENGINEERING TECHNIQUES, OR ACTING IN A COORDINATED MANNER TO LAUNCH DISTRIBUTED DENIAL OF SERVICE OR OTHER COORDINATED ATTACKS. CYBER THREATS ARE CONSTANTLY EVOLVING, THEREBY

INCREASING THE DIFFICULTY OF DETECTING AND SUCCESSFULLY DEFENDING AGAINST THEM. CYBER THREATS CAN HAVE CASCADING IMPACTS THAT UNFOLD WITH INCREASING SPEED ACROSS OUR INTERNAL NETWORKS AND SYSTEMS AND THOSE OF OUR PARTNERS AND CUSTOMERS. BREACHES OF

OUR NETWORK OR DATA SECURITY COULD DISRUPT THE SECURITY OF OUR INTERNAL SYSTEMS AND BUSINESS APPLICATIONS, IMPAIR OUR ABILITY TO PROVIDE SERVICES TO OUR CUSTOMERS AND PROTECT THE PRIVACY OF THEIR DATA, RESULT IN PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT DELAYS,

COMPROMISE CONFIDENTIAL OR TECHNICAL BUSINESS INFORMATION HARMING OUR COMPETITIVE POSITION, RESULT IN THEFT OR MISUSE OF OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY OR OTHER ASSETS, REQUIRE US TO ALLOCATE MORE RESOURCES TO IMPROVED TECHNOLOGIES, OR OTHERWISE

ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS.

IN ADDITION, OUR INTERNAL IT ENVIRONMENT CONTINUES TO EVOLVE. OFTEN WE ARE EARLY ADOPTERS OF NEW DEVICES

AND TECHNOLOGIES. WE EMBRACE NEW WAYS OF SHARING DATA AND COMMUNICATING INTERNALLY AND WITH PARTNERS AND CUSTOMERS USING METHODS SUCH AS SOCIAL NETWORKING AND OTHER CONSUMER-ORIENTED TECHNOLOGIES. OUR BUSINESS POLICIES AND INTERNAL SECURITY CONTROLS

MAY NOT KEEP PACE WITH THESE CHANGES AS NEW THREATS EMERGE.

SECURITY OF OUR PRODUCTS, SERVICES, DEVICES, AND CUSTOMERS DATA

SECURITY THREATS ARE A PARTICULAR CHALLENGE TO COMPANIES LIKE US WHOSE BUSINESS IS TECHNOLOGY PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. THREATS TO OUR OWN IT

INFRASTRUCTURE CAN ALSO AFFECT OUR CUSTOMERS. CUSTOMERS USING OUR CLOUD-BASED SERVICES RELY ON THE SECURITY OF OUR INFRASTRUCTURE TO ENSURE THE RELIABILITY OF OUR SERVICES AND THE PROTECTION OF THEIR DATA. HACKERS TEND TO FOCUS THEIR EFFORTS ON THE

MOST POPULAR OPERATING SYSTEMS, PROGRAMS, AND SERVICES, INCLUDING MANY OF OURS, AND WE EXPECT THAT TO CONTINUE. THE SECURITY OF OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES IS IMPORTANT IN OUR CUSTOMERS PURCHASING DECISIONS.

TO DEFEND AGAINST SECURITY THREATS, BOTH TO OUR INTERNAL IT SYSTEMS AND THOSE OF OUR CUSTOMERS, WE MUST CONTINUOUSLY ENGINEER MORE SECURE PRODUCTS

AND SERVICES, ENHANCE SECURITY AND RELIABILITY FEATURES, IMPROVE THE DEPLOYMENT OF SOFTWARE UPDATES TO ADDRESS SECURITY VULNERABILITIES, DEVELOP MITIGATION TECHNOLOGIES THAT HELP TO SECURE CUSTOMERS FROM ATTACKS EVEN WHEN SOFTWARE UPDATES ARE NOT

DEPLOYED, MAINTAIN THE DIGITAL SECURITY INFRASTRUCTURE THAT PROTECTS THE INTEGRITY OF OUR NETWORK, PRODUCTS, AND SERVICES, AND PROVIDE CUSTOMERS SECURITY TOOLS SUCH AS FIREWALLS AND ANTI-VIRUS SOFTWARE.

THE COST OF THESE STEPS COULD REDUCE OUR OPERATING MARGINS. IF WE FAIL TO DO THESE THINGS WELL, ACTUAL OR PERCEIVED SECURITY VULNERABILITIES IN OUR

PRODUCTS AND SERVICES COULD HARM OUR REPUTATION AND LEAD CUSTOMERS TO REDUCE OR DELAY FUTURE PURCHASES OF PRODUCTS OR SUBSCRIPTIONS TO SERVICES, OR TO USE COMPETING PRODUCTS OR SERVICES. CUSTOMERS MAY ALSO SPEND MORE ON PROTECTING THEIR EXISTING

COMPUTER SYSTEMS FROM ATTACK, WHICH COULD DELAY ADOPTION OF ADDITIONAL

21

TABLE OF CONTENTS

ITEM 1A

PRODUCTS OR SERVICES. CUSTOMERS MAY FAIL TO UPDATE THEIR SYSTEMS, CONTINUE TO RUN SOFTWARE OR OPERATING SYSTEMS WE NO LONGER SUPPORT, OR MAY FAIL TIMELY TO INSTALL SECURITY PATCHES. ANY OF THESE

ACTIONS BY CUSTOMERS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR REVENUE. ACTUAL OR PERCEIVED VULNERABILITIES MAY LEAD TO CLAIMS AGAINST US. ALTHOUGH OUR LICENSE AGREEMENTS TYPICALLY CONTAIN PROVISIONS THAT ELIMINATE OR LIMIT OUR EXPOSURE TO LIABILITY, THERE IS NO

ASSURANCE THESE PROVISIONS WILL WITHSTAND LEGAL CHALLENGES. LEGISLATIVE OR REGULATORY ACTION IN THESE AREAS MAY INCREASE THE COSTS TO DEVELOP, IMPLEMENT, OR SECURE OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES.

DISCLOSURE OF PERSONAL DATA COULD CAUSE LIABILITY AND HARM OUR REPUTATION.

AS WE CONTINUE TO GROW THE NUMBER AND

SCALE OF OUR CLOUD-BASED OFFERINGS, WE STORE AND PROCESS INCREASINGLY LARGE AMOUNTS OF PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION OF OUR CUSTOMERS. THE CONTINUED OCCURRENCE OF HIGH-PROFILE DATA BREACHES PROVIDES EVIDENCE OF AN EXTERNAL ENVIRONMENT

INCREASINGLY HOSTILE TO INFORMATION SECURITY. DESPITE OUR EFFORTS TO IMPROVE THE SECURITY CONTROLS ACROSS OUR BUSINESS GROUPS AND GEOGRAPHIES, IT IS POSSIBLE OUR SECURITY CONTROLS OVER PERSONAL DATA, OUR TRAINING OF EMPLOYEES AND VENDORS ON DATA

SECURITY, AND OTHER PRACTICES WE FOLLOW MAY NOT PREVENT THE IMPROPER DISCLOSURE OF CUSTOMER DATA WE OR OUR VENDORS STORE AND MANAGE. IMPROPER DISCLOSURE COULD HARM OUR REPUTATION, LEAD TO LEGAL EXPOSURE TO CUSTOMERS, OR SUBJECT US TO LIABILITY UNDER

LAWS THAT PROTECT PERSONAL DATA, RESULTING IN INCREASED COSTS OR LOSS OF REVENUE. OUR SOFTWARE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES ALSO ENABLE OUR CUSTOMERS TO STORE AND PROCESS PERSONAL DATA ON-PREMISES OR, INCREASINGLY, IN A CLOUD-BASED ENVIRONMENT WE HOST.

GOVERNMENT AUTHORITIES CAN SOMETIMES REQUIRE US TO PRODUCE CUSTOMER DATA IN RESPONSE TO VALID LEGAL ORDERS. IN THE U.S. AND ELSEWHERE, WE ADVOCATE FOR TRANSPARENCY CONCERNING THESE REQUESTS AND APPROPRIATE LIMITATIONS ON GOVERNMENT AUTHORITY TO

COMPEL DISCLOSURE. DESPITE OUR EFFORTS TO PROTECT CUSTOMER DATA, PERCEPTIONS THAT THE COLLECTION, USE AND RETENTION OF PERSONAL INFORMATION IS NOT SATISFACTORILY PROTECTED COULD INHIBIT SALES OF OUR PRODUCTS OR SERVICES, AND COULD LIMIT ADOPTION OF

OUR CLOUD-BASED SOLUTIONS BY CONSUMERS, BUSINESSES, AND GOVERNMENT ENTITIES. ADDITIONAL SECURITY MEASURES WE MAY TAKE TO ADDRESS CUSTOMER CONCERNS, OR CONSTRAINTS ON OUR FLEXIBILITY TO DETERMINE WHERE AND HOW TO OPERATE DATACENTERS IN RESPONSE TO

CUSTOMER EXPECTATIONS OR GOVERNMENTAL RULES OR ACTIONS, MAY CAUSE HIGHER OPERATING EXPENSES.

WE MAY HAVE OUTAGES, DATA LOSSES, AND

DISRUPTIONS OF OUR ONLINE SERVICES IF WE FAIL TO MAINTAIN AN ADEQUATE OPERATIONS INFRASTRUCTURE.

OUR INCREASING USER TRAFFIC, GROWTH IN SERVICES, AND THE COMPLEXITY OF OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES DEMAND MORE COMPUTING POWER.

WE SPEND SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNTS TO BUILD, PURCHASE, OR LEASE DATACENTERS AND EQUIPMENT AND TO UPGRADE OUR TECHNOLOGY AND NETWORK INFRASTRUCTURE TO HANDLE MORE TRAFFIC ON OUR WEBSITES AND IN OUR DATACENTERS. THESE DEMANDS CONTINUE TO INCREASE AS WE

INTRODUCE NEW PRODUCTS AND SERVICES AND SUPPORT THE GROWTH OF EXISTING SERVICES SUCH AS BING, EXCHANGE ONLINE, OFFICE 365, SHAREPOINT ONLINE, ONEDRIVE, SKYPE, XBOX LIVE, MICROSOFT AZURE, OUTLOOK.COM, WINDOWS STORES, AND MICROSOFT ACCOUNT SERVICES.

WE ARE RAPIDLY GROWING OUR BUSINESS OF PROVIDING A PLATFORM AND BACK-END HOSTING FOR SERVICES PROVIDED BY THIRD PARTIES TO THEIR END USERS. MAINTAINING, SECURING, AND EXPANDING THIS INFRASTRUCTURE IS EXPENSIVE AND COMPLEX. IT REQUIRES THAT WE

MAINTAIN AN INTERNET CONNECTIVITY INFRASTRUCTURE THAT IS ROBUST AND RELIABLE WITHIN COMPETITIVE AND REGULATORY CONSTRAINTS THAT CONTINUE TO EVOLVE. INEFFICIENCIES OR OPERATIONAL FAILURES, INCLUDING TEMPORARY OR PERMANENT LOSS OF CUSTOMER DATA OR

INSUFFICIENT INTERNET CONNECTIVITY, COULD DIMINISH THE QUALITY OF OUR PRODUCTS, SERVICES, AND USER EXPERIENCE RESULTING IN CONTRACTUAL LIABILITY, CLAIMS BY CUSTOMERS AND OTHER THIRD PARTIES, DAMAGE TO OUR REPUTATION AND LOSS OF CURRENT AND POTENTIAL

USERS, SUBSCRIBERS, AND ADVERTISERS, EACH OF WHICH MAY HARM OUR OPERATING RESULTS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

GOVERNMENT LITIGATION AND

REGULATORY ACTIVITY RELATING TO COMPETITION RULES MAY LIMIT HOW WE DESIGN AND MARKET OUR PRODUCTS.

AS A LEADING GLOBAL SOFTWARE AND DEVICE MAKER, WE ARE CLOSELY SCRUTINIZED BY GOVERNMENT AGENCIES UNDER U.S. AND FOREIGN

COMPETITION LAWS. AN INCREASING NUMBER OF GOVERNMENTS ARE REGULATING COMPETITION LAW ACTIVITIES AND THIS INCLUDES INCREASED SCRUTINY IN POTENTIALLY LARGE MARKETS SUCH AS THE EUROPEAN UNION (EU), THE U.S., AND CHINA. SOME JURISDICTIONS

ALSO ALLOW COMPETITORS OR CONSUMERS TO ASSERT CLAIMS OF ANTI-COMPETITIVE CONDUCT. U.S. FEDERAL AND STATE ANTITRUST AUTHORITIES HAVE PREVIOUSLY BROUGHT ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS AND CONTINUE TO SCRUTINIZE OUR BUSINESS.

THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION (THE COMMISSION) CLOSELY SCRUTINIZES THE DESIGN OF HIGH-VOLUME MICROSOFT PRODUCTS AND THE TERMS ON WHICH WE

MAKE CERTAIN TECHNOLOGIES USED IN THESE PRODUCTS, SUCH AS FILE FORMATS, PROGRAMMING INTERFACES, AND PROTOCOLS, AVAILABLE TO OTHER COMPANIES. FLAGSHIP PRODUCT RELEASES SUCH AS WINDOWS 10 CAN RECEIVE SIGNIFICANT SCRUTINY UNDER COMPETITION LAWS. FOR

EXAMPLE, IN 2004, THE COMMISSION ORDERED US TO CREATE NEW VERSIONS OF OUR WINDOWS OPERATING SYSTEM THAT DO NOT INCLUDE CERTAIN MULTIMEDIA TECHNOLOGIES AND TO PROVIDE OUR

22

ITEM 1A

COMPETITORS WITH SPECIFICATIONS FOR HOW TO IMPLEMENT CERTAIN PROPRIETARY WINDOWS COMMUNICATIONS PROTOCOLS IN THEIR OWN PRODUCTS. IN 2009, THE COMMISSION ACCEPTED A SET OF COMMITMENTS OFFERED BY

MICROSOFT TO ADDRESS THE COMMISSIONS CONCERNS RELATING TO COMPETITION IN WEB BROWSING SOFTWARE, INCLUDING AN UNDERTAKING TO ADDRESS COMMISSION CONCERNS RELATING TO INTEROPERABILITY. THE WEB BROWSING COMMITMENTS EXPIRED IN 2014. THE REMAINING

OBLIGATIONS MAY LIMIT OUR ABILITY TO INNOVATE IN WINDOWS OR OTHER PRODUCTS IN THE FUTURE, DIMINISH THE DEVELOPER APPEAL OF THE WINDOWS PLATFORM, AND INCREASE OUR PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT COSTS. THE AVAILABILITY OF LICENSES RELATED TO PROTOCOLS AND FILE

FORMATS MAY ENABLE COMPETITORS TO DEVELOP SOFTWARE PRODUCTS THAT BETTER MIMIC THE FUNCTIONALITY OF OUR PRODUCTS, WHICH COULD HAMPER SALES OF OUR PRODUCTS.

OUR PORTFOLIO OF FIRST-PARTY DEVICES CONTINUES TO GROW; AT THE SAME TIME OUR OEM PARTNERS OFFER A LARGE VARIETY OF DEVICES ON OUR PLATFORMS. AS A RESULT, INCREASINGLY WE BOTH COOPERATE AND COMPETE WITH OUR OEM

PARTNERS, CREATING A RISK THAT WE FAIL TO DO SO IN COMPLIANCE WITH COMPETITION RULES. REGULATORY SCRUTINY IN THIS AREA MAY INCREASE. CERTAIN FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS, PARTICULARLY IN CHINA AND OTHER COUNTRIES IN ASIA, HAVE ADVANCED ARGUMENTS UNDER THEIR

COMPETITION LAWS THAT EXERT DOWNWARD PRESSURE ON ROYALTIES FOR OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY. BECAUSE THESE JURISDICTIONS ONLY RECENTLY IMPLEMENTED COMPETITION LAWS, THEIR ENFORCEMENT ACTIVITIES ARE UNPREDICTABLE.

GOVERNMENT REGULATORY ACTIONS AND COURT DECISIONS SUCH AS THESE MAY HINDER OUR ABILITY TO PROVIDE THE BENEFITS OF OUR SOFTWARE TO CONSUMERS AND

BUSINESSES, REDUCING THE ATTRACTIVENESS OF OUR PRODUCTS AND THE REVENUE THAT COME FROM THEM. NEW COMPETITION LAW ACTIONS COULD BE INITIATED. THE OUTCOME OF SUCH ACTIONS, OR STEPS TAKEN TO AVOID THEM, COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT US IN A VARIETY OF WAYS,

INCLUDING.



WE MAY HAVE TO CHOOSE BETWEEN WITHDRAWING PRODUCTS FROM CERTAIN GEOGRAPHIES TO AVOID FINES OR DESIGNING AND DEVELOPING ALTERNATIVE VERSIONS OF THOSE PRODUCTS

TO COMPLY WITH GOVERNMENT RULINGS, WHICH MAY ENTAIL A DELAY IN A PRODUCT RELEASE AND REMOVING FUNCTIONALITY THAT CUSTOMERS WANT OR ON WHICH DEVELOPERS RELY.



WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO MAKE AVAILABLE LICENSES TO OUR PROPRIETARY TECHNOLOGIES ON TERMS THAT DO NOT REFLECT THEIR FAIR MARKET VALUE OR DO NOT PROTECT OUR

ASSOCIATED INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY.



THE RULINGS DESCRIBED ABOVE MAY BE PRECEDENT IN OTHER COMPETITION LAW PROCEEDINGS.



WE ARE SUBJECT TO A VARIETY OF ONGOING COMMITMENTS BECAUSE OF COURT OR ADMINISTRATIVE ORDERS, CONSENT DECREES, OR OTHER VOLUNTARY ACTIONS WE HAVE TAKEN. IF WE

FAIL TO COMPLY WITH THESE COMMITMENTS, WE MAY INCUR LITIGATION COSTS AND BE SUBJECT TO SUBSTANTIAL FINES OR OTHER REMEDIAL ACTIONS.



OUR ABILITY TO REALIZE ANTICIPATED WINDOWS 10 POST-SALE MONETIZATION OPPORTUNITIES MAY BE LIMITED.

OUR GLOBAL OPERATIONS SUBJECT US TO POTENTIAL LIABILITY UNDER ANTI-CORRUPTION, TRADE PROTECTION, AND OTHER LAWS AND

REGULATIONS.

THE FOREIGN CORRUPT PRACTICES ACT AND OTHER ANTI-CORRUPTION LAWS AND REGULATIONS (ANTI-CORRUPTION LAWS) PROHIBIT CORRUPT PAYMENTS BY OUR EMPLOYEES, VENDORS, OR AGENTS. FROM TIME TO TIME, WE RECEIVE

INQUIRIES FROM AUTHORITIES IN THE U.S. AND ELSEWHERE AND REPORTS FROM EMPLOYEES AND OTHERS ABOUT OUR BUSINESS ACTIVITIES OUTSIDE THE U.S. AND OUR COMPLIANCE WITH ANTI-CORRUPTION LAWS. SPECIFICALLY, WE HAVE BEEN COOPERATING WITH AUTHORITIES IN THE US

IN CONNECTION WITH REPORTS CONCERNING OUR COMPLIANCE WITH THE FOREIGN CORRUPT PRACTICES ACT IN VARIOUS COUNTRIES. WHILE WE DEVOTE SUBSTANTIAL RESOURCES TO OUR GLOBAL COMPLIANCE PROGRAMS AND HAVE IMPLEMENTED POLICIES, TRAINING, AND INTERNAL CONTROLS

DESIGNED TO REDUCE THE RISK OF CORRUPT PAYMENTS, OUR EMPLOYEES, VENDORS, OR AGENTS MAY VIOLATE OUR POLICIES. OUR FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH ANTI-CORRUPTION LAWS COULD RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT FINES AND PENALTIES, CRIMINAL SANCTIONS AGAINST US, OUR

OFFICERS, OR OUR EMPLOYEES, PROHIBITIONS ON THE CONDUCT OF OUR BUSINESS, AND DAMAGE TO OUR REPUTATION. GEOPOLITICAL INSTABILITY MAY LEAD TO SANCTIONS AND IMPACT OUR ABILITY TO DO BUSINESS IN SOME GEOGRAPHIES. OPERATIONS OUTSIDE THE U.S. MAY BE

AFFECTED BY CHANGES IN TRADE PROTECTION LAWS, POLICIES, AND MEASURES, SANCTIONS, AND OTHER REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS AFFECTING TRADE AND INVESTMENT. WE MAY BE SUBJECT TO LEGAL LIABILITY AND REPUTATIONAL DAMAGE IF WE SELL GOODS OR SERVICES IN VIOLATION

OF U.S. TRADE SANCTIONS ON COUNTRIES SUCH AS IRAN, NORTH KOREA, CUBA, SUDAN, AND SYRIA.

OTHER REGULATORY AREAS THAT MAY APPLY TO OUR

PRODUCTS AND ONLINE SERVICES OFFERINGS INCLUDE USER PRIVACY, TELECOMMUNICATIONS, DATA STORAGE AND PROTECTION, AND ONLINE CONTENT. FOR EXAMPLE, REGULATORS MAY TAKE THE POSITION THAT OUR OFFERINGS SUCH AS SKYPE ARE COVERED BY LAWS REGULATING

TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICES. APPLYING THESE LAWS AND REGULATIONS TO OUR BUSINESS IS OFTEN UNCLEAR, SUBJECT TO CHANGE OVER TIME, AND SOMETIMES MAY CONFLICT FROM

JURISDICTION TO JURISDICTION. ADDITIONALLY, THESE LAWS AND GOVERNMENTS APPROACH TO THEIR ENFORCEMENT, AND OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, ARE CONTINUING TO EVOLVE. COMPLIANCE WITH THESE TYPES OF

REGULATION MAY INVOLVE SIGNIFICANT COSTS OR REQUIRE CHANGES IN PRODUCTS OR BUSINESS PRACTICES THAT RESULT IN REDUCED REVENUE. NONCOMPLIANCE COULD RESULT IN THE IMPOSITION OF PENALTIES OR ORDERS WE STOP THE ALLEGED NONCOMPLIANT ACTIVITY.

LAWS AND REGULATIONS RELATING TO THE HANDLING OF PERSONAL DATA MAY IMPEDE THE ADOPTION OF OUR SERVICES OR RESULT IN INCREASED COSTS, LEGAL

CLAIMS, OR FINES AGAINST US.

THE GROWTH OF OUR INTERNET- AND CLOUD-BASED SERVICES INTERNATIONALLY RELIES INCREASINGLY ON THE MOVEMENT OF DATA ACROSS NATIONAL BOUNDARIES. LEGAL REQUIREMENTS RELATING TO THE COLLECTION,

STORAGE, HANDLING, AND TRANSFER OF PERSONAL DATA CONTINUE TO EVOLVE. FOR EXAMPLE, IN OCTOBER 2015 THE EUROPEAN COURT OF JUSTICE (ECJ) INVALIDATED THE EU/U.S. SAFE HARBOR FRAMEWORK, IN PLACE SINCE 2000, THAT ENABLED COMPANIES TO TRANSFER

DATA FROM EU MEMBER STATES TO THE U.S. ALTHOUGH OTHER LEGALLY-RECOGNIZED METHODS TO ENABLE DATA TRANSFERS CURRENTLY REMAIN VALID, THE REASONING OF THE ECJ STRIKING DOWN THE SAFE HARBOR FRAMEWORK COULD BE USED TO CHALLENGE THOSE METHODS IN FUTURE

COMPLAINTS. THERE IS A RECOGNIZED NEED FOR A NEW REGULATORY SAFE HARBOR FRAMEWORK THAT WILL ALSO SUPPORT OTHER METHODS OF DATA TRANSFER BETWEEN THE EU AND U.S. OUTCOMES MAY INCLUDE A NEW TRANS-ATLANTIC DATA TRANSFER AGREEMENT, A NEW EU DATA

PROTECTION DIRECTIVE, OR A RANGE OF LEGAL REQUIREMENTS ADOPTED BY INDIVIDUAL EU MEMBER STATES, OR NO ACTION AT ALL. ONE OR MORE OF THESE OUTCOMES MAY RESULT IN BURDENSOME OR INCONSISTENT REQUIREMENTS AFFECTING THE LOCATION AND MOVEMENT OF OUR

CUSTOMER AND INTERNAL EMPLOYEE DATA AS WELL AS THE MANAGEMENT OF THAT DATA. COMPLIANCE MAY REQUIRE CHANGES IN SERVICES, BUSINESS PRACTICES, OR INTERNAL SYSTEMS THAT RESULT IN INCREASED COSTS, LOWER REVENUE, REDUCED EFFICIENCY, OR GREATER DIFFICULTY

IN COMPETING WITH FOREIGN-BASED FIRMS. FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH EXISTING OR NEW RULES MAY RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT PENALTIES OR ORDERS TO STOP THE ALLEGED NONCOMPLIANT ACTIVITY.

OUR BUSINESS DEPENDS ON OUR ABILITY TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN TALENTED EMPLOYEES.

OUR BUSINESS IS BASED ON SUCCESSFULLY ATTRACTING AND RETAINING TALENTED EMPLOYEES. THE MARKET FOR HIGHLY

SKILLED WORKERS AND LEADERS IN OUR INDUSTRY IS EXTREMELY COMPETITIVE. WE ARE LIMITED IN OUR ABILITY TO RECRUIT INTERNATIONALLY BY RESTRICTIVE DOMESTIC IMMIGRATION LAWS. IF WE ARE LESS SUCCESSFUL IN OUR RECRUITING EFFORTS, OR IF WE CANNOT RETAIN KEY

EMPLOYEES, OUR ABILITY TO DEVELOP AND DELIVER SUCCESSFUL PRODUCTS AND SERVICES MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED. EFFECTIVE SUCCESSION PLANNING IS ALSO IMPORTANT TO OUR LONG-TERM SUCCESS. FAILURE TO ENSURE EFFECTIVE TRANSFER OF KNOWLEDGE AND SMOOTH

TRANSITIONS INVOLVING KEY EMPLOYEES COULD HINDER OUR STRATEGIC PLANNING AND EXECUTION. HOW EMPLOYMENT-RELATED LAWS ARE INTERPRETED AND APPLIED TO OUR WORKFORCE PRACTICES MAY RESULT IN INCREASED OPERATING COSTS AND LESS FLEXIBILITY IN HOW WE MEET OUR

WORKFORCE NEEDS.

WE HAVE CLAIMS AND LAWSUITS AGAINST US THAT MAY RESULT IN ADVERSE OUTCOMES.

WE ARE

SUBJECT TO A VARIETY OF CLAIMS AND LAWSUITS. THESE CLAIMS MAY ARISE FROM A WIDE VARIETY OF BUSINESS PRACTICES AND INITIATIVES, INCLUDING MAJOR NEW PRODUCT RELEASES SUCH AS WINDOWS 10, SIGNIFICANT BUSINESS TRANSACTIONS, AND EMPLOYMENT PRACTICES.

ADVERSE OUTCOMES IN SOME OR ALL OF THESE CLAIMS MAY RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT MONETARY DAMAGES OR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF THAT COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO CONDUCT OUR BUSINESS. THE LITIGATION AND OTHER CLAIMS ARE SUBJECT TO INHERENT UNCERTAINTIES

AND MANAGEMENTS VIEW OF THESE MATTERS MAY CHANGE IN THE FUTURE. A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS COULD OCCUR FOR THE PERIOD IN WHICH THE EFFECT OF AN UNFAVORABLE FINAL OUTCOME BECOMES PROBABLE AND REASONABLY

ESTIMABLE.

WE MAY HAVE ADDITIONAL TAX LIABILITIES.

WE ARE SUBJECT TO INCOME TAXES IN THE U.S. AND MANY

FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS. SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT IS REQUIRED IN DETERMINING OUR WORLDWIDE PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES. IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF OUR BUSINESS, THERE ARE MANY TRANSACTIONS AND CALCULATIONS WHERE THE ULTIMATE TAX DETERMINATION IS UNCERTAIN.

WE REGULARLY ARE UNDER AUDIT BY TAX AUTHORITIES IN DIFFERENT JURISDICTIONS. ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL PRESSURES TO INCREASE TAX REVENUE IN VARIOUS JURISDICTIONS MAY MAKE RESOLVING TAX DISPUTES FAVORABLY MORE DIFFICULT. ALTHOUGH WE BELIEVE OUR

TAX ESTIMATES ARE REASONABLE, THE FINAL DETERMINATION OF TAX AUDITS AND ANY RELATED LITIGATION IN THE JURISDICTIONS WHERE WE ARE SUBJECT TO TAXATION COULD BE MATERIALLY DIFFERENT FROM OUR HISTORICAL INCOME TAX PROVISIONS AND ACCRUALS. THE RESULTS OF

AN AUDIT OR LITIGATION COULD HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN THE PERIOD OR PERIODS IN WHICH THAT DETERMINATION IS MADE.

WE EARN A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF OUR OPERATING INCOME FROM OUTSIDE THE U.S., AND ANY REPATRIATION OF FUNDS CURRENTLY HELD IN FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS TO THE U.S. MAY RESULT IN HIGHER EFFECTIVE TAX RATES FOR THE

COMPANY. IN ADDITION, THERE HAVE BEEN PROPOSALS FROM CONGRESS TO CHANGE U.S. TAX LAWS THAT WOULD SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT HOW U.S. MULTINATIONAL CORPORATIONS ARE TAXED ON FOREIGN EARNINGS. ALTHOUGH WE CANNOT PREDICT WHETHER OR IN WHAT FORM ANY PROPOSED

LEGISLATION MAY PASS, IF ENACTED, IT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR TAX EXPENSE AND CASH FLOWS.

ITEM 1A

OUR HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE PRODUCTS MAY EXPERIENCE QUALITY OR SUPPLY

PROBLEMS.

OUR VERTICALLY-INTEGRATED HARDWARE PRODUCTS SUCH AS XBOX CONSOLES, SURFACE DEVICES, PHONES, AND OTHER DEVICES WE DESIGN, MANUFACTURE, AND MARKET ARE HIGHLY COMPLEX AND CAN HAVE DEFECTS IN DESIGN, MANUFACTURE, OR

ASSOCIATED SOFTWARE. WE COULD INCUR SIGNIFICANT EXPENSES, LOST REVENUE, AND REPUTATIONAL HARM IF WE FAIL TO DETECT OR ADDRESS SUCH ISSUES THROUGH DESIGN, TESTING, OR WARRANTY REPAIRS. WE ACQUIRE SOME DEVICE COMPONENTS FROM SOLE SUPPLIERS. OUR

COMPETITORS USE SOME OF THE SAME SUPPLIERS AND THEIR DEMAND FOR HARDWARE COMPONENTS CAN AFFECT THE CAPACITY AVAILABLE TO US. IF A COMPONENT FROM A SOLE-SOURCE SUPPLIER IS DELAYED OR BECOMES UNAVAILABLE, WHETHER BECAUSE OF SUPPLIER CAPACITY

CONSTRAINT OR INDUSTRY SHORTAGES, WE MAY NOT OBTAIN TIMELY REPLACEMENT SUPPLIES, RESULTING IN REDUCED SALES. COMPONENT SHORTAGES, EXCESS OR OBSOLETE INVENTORY, OR PRICE REDUCTIONS RESULTING IN INVENTORY ADJUSTMENTS MAY INCREASE OUR COST OF REVENUE.

XBOX CONSOLES, SURFACE DEVICES, PHONES, AND OTHER HARDWARE ARE ASSEMBLED IN ASIA AND OTHER GEOGRAPHIES THAT MAY BE SUBJECT TO DISRUPTIONS IN THE SUPPLY CHAIN, RESULTING IN SHORTAGES THAT WOULD AFFECT OUR REVENUE AND OPERATING MARGINS. THESE SAME

RISKS WOULD APPLY TO ANY OTHER VERTICALLY-INTEGRATED HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE PRODUCTS WE MAY OFFER.

OUR SOFTWARE PRODUCTS ALSO MAY

EXPERIENCE QUALITY OR RELIABILITY PROBLEMS. THE HIGHLY SOPHISTICATED SOFTWARE PRODUCTS WE DEVELOP MAY CONTAIN BUGS AND OTHER DEFECTS THAT INTERFERE WITH THEIR INTENDED OPERATION. ANY DEFECTS WE DO NOT DETECT AND FIX IN PRE-RELEASE TESTING COULD

CAUSE REDUCED SALES AND REVENUE, DAMAGE TO OUR REPUTATION, REPAIR OR REMEDIATION COSTS, DELAYS IN THE RELEASE OF NEW PRODUCTS OR VERSIONS, OR LEGAL LIABILITY. ALTHOUGH OUR LICENSE AGREEMENTS TYPICALLY CONTAIN PROVISIONS THAT ELIMINATE OR LIMIT OUR

EXPOSURE TO LIABILITY, THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THESE PROVISIONS WILL WITHSTAND LEGAL CHALLENGE.

WE STRIVE TO EMPOWER ALL PEOPLE AND

ORGANIZATIONS TO ACHIEVE MORE AND ACCESSIBILITY OF OUR PRODUCTS IS AN IMPORTANT ASPECT OF THIS GOAL. THERE IS INCREASING PRESSURE FROM ADVOCACY GROUPS, REGULATORS, COMPETITORS, AND CUSTOMERS TO MAKE TECHNOLOGY MORE ACCESSIBLE. IF OUR PRODUCTS DO NOT

MEET CUSTOMER EXPECTATIONS OR EMERGING GLOBAL ACCESSIBILITY REQUIREMENTS, WE COULD LOSE SALES OPPORTUNITIES OR FACE REGULATORY ACTIONS.

OUR GLOBAL BUSINESS EXPOSES US TO OPERATIONAL AND ECONOMIC RISKS.

OUR CUSTOMERS ARE LOCATED IN OVER 200 COUNTRIES AND

A SIGNIFICANT PART OF OUR REVENUE COMES FROM INTERNATIONAL SALES. THE GLOBAL NATURE OF OUR BUSINESS CREATES OPERATIONAL AND ECONOMIC RISKS. EMERGING MARKETS ARE A SIGNIFICANT FOCUS OF OUR INTERNATIONAL GROWTH STRATEGY. THE DEVELOPING NATURE OF THESE

MARKETS PRESENTS SEVERAL RISKS, INCLUDING DETERIORATION OF SOCIAL, POLITICAL, LABOR, OR ECONOMIC CONDITIONS IN A COUNTRY OR REGION, AND DIFFICULTIES IN STAFFING AND MANAGING FOREIGN OPERATIONS. ALTHOUGH WE HEDGE A PORTION OF OUR INTERNATIONAL

CURRENCY EXPOSURE, SIGNIFICANT FLUCTUATIONS IN FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES BETWEEN THE U.S. DOLLAR AND FOREIGN CURRENCIES MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR REVENUE. COMPETITIVE OR REGULATORY PRESSURE TO MAKE OUR PRICING STRUCTURE UNIFORM MIGHT REQUIRE THAT WE

REDUCE THE SALES PRICE OF OUR SOFTWARE IN THE U.S. AND OTHER COUNTRIES.

CATASTROPHIC EVENTS OR GEOPOLITICAL CONDITIONS MAY DISRUPT

OUR BUSINESS.

A DISRUPTION OR FAILURE OF OUR SYSTEMS OR OPERATIONS BECAUSE OF A MAJOR EARTHQUAKE, WEATHER EVENT, CYBER-ATTACK, TERRORIST ATTACK, OR OTHER CATASTROPHIC EVENT COULD CAUSE DELAYS IN COMPLETING SALES, PROVIDING

SERVICES, OR PERFORMING OTHER CRITICAL FUNCTIONS. OUR CORPORATE HEADQUARTERS, A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES, AND CERTAIN OTHER ESSENTIAL BUSINESS OPERATIONS ARE IN THE SEATTLE, WASHINGTON AREA, AND WE HAVE OTHER

BUSINESS OPERATIONS IN THE SILICON VALLEY AREA OF CALIFORNIA, BOTH OF WHICH ARE SEISMICALLY ACTIVE REGIONS. A CATASTROPHIC EVENT THAT RESULTS IN THE DESTRUCTION OR DISRUPTION OF ANY OF OUR CRITICAL BUSINESS OR IT SYSTEMS COULD HARM OUR ABILITY TO

CONDUCT NORMAL BUSINESS OPERATIONS. PROVIDING OUR CUSTOMERS WITH MORE SERVICES AND SOLUTIONS IN THE CLOUD PUTS A PREMIUM ON THE RESILIENCE OF OUR SYSTEMS AND STRENGTH OF OUR BUSINESS CONTINUITY MANAGEMENT PLANS, AND MAGNIFIES THE POTENTIAL IMPACT OF

PROLONGED SERVICE OUTAGES ON OUR OPERATING RESULTS.

ABRUPT POLITICAL CHANGE, TERRORIST ACTIVITY, AND ARMED CONFLICT POSE A RISK OF

GENERAL ECONOMIC DISRUPTION IN AFFECTED COUNTRIES, WHICH MAY INCREASE OUR OPERATING COSTS. THESE CONDITIONS ALSO MAY ADD UNCERTAINTY TO THE TIMING AND BUDGET FOR TECHNOLOGY INVESTMENT DECISIONS BY OUR CUSTOMERS, AND MAY CAUSE SUPPLY CHAIN

DISRUPTIONS FOR HARDWARE MANUFACTURERS, EITHER OF WHICH MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR REVENUE. THE LONG-TERM EFFECTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE ON THE GLOBAL ECONOMY OR THE IT INDUSTRY IN PARTICULAR ARE UNCLEAR. ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS OR CHANGES IN THE SUPPLY,

DEMAND OR AVAILABLE SOURCES OF ENERGY OR OTHER NATURAL RESOURCES MAY AFFECT THE AVAILABILITY OR COST OF GOODS AND SERVICES, INCLUDING NATURAL RESOURCES, NECESSARY TO RUN OUR BUSINESS. CHANGES IN WEATHER WHERE WE OPERATE MAY INCREASE THE COSTS OF

POWERING AND COOLING COMPUTER HARDWARE WE USE TO DEVELOP SOFTWARE AND PROVIDE CLOUD-BASED SERVICES.

ADVERSE ECONOMIC OR MARKET CONDITIONS MAY HARM OUR

BUSINESS.

WORSENING ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, INCLUDING INFLATION, RECESSION, OR OTHER CHANGES IN ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, MAY CAUSE LOWER IT SPENDING AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR REVENUE. IF DEMAND FOR PCS, SERVERS, AND OTHER

COMPUTING DEVICES DECLINES, OR CONSUMER OR BUSINESS SPENDING FOR THOSE PRODUCTS DECLINES, OUR REVENUE WILL BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED. SUBSTANTIAL REVENUE COMES FROM OUR U.S. GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS. AN EXTENDED FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN RESULTING FROM

FAILING TO PASS BUDGET APPROPRIATIONS, ADOPT CONTINUING FUNDING RESOLUTIONS OR RAISE THE DEBT CEILING, AND OTHER BUDGETARY DECISIONS LIMITING OR DELAYING FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SPENDING, COULD REDUCE GOVERNMENT IT SPENDING ON OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES

AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR REVENUE.

OUR PRODUCT DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM RELIES ON AN EXTENSIVE PARTNER AND RETAIL NETWORK. OEMS BUILDING

DEVICES THAT RUN OUR SOFTWARE HAVE ALSO BEEN A SIGNIFICANT MEANS OF DISTRIBUTION. THE IMPACT OF ECONOMIC CONDITIONS ON OUR PARTNERS, SUCH AS THE BANKRUPTCY OF A MAJOR DISTRIBUTOR, OEM, OR RETAILER, COULD CAUSE SALES CHANNEL DISRUPTION.

CHALLENGING ECONOMIC CONDITIONS ALSO MAY IMPAIR THE ABILITY OF OUR CUSTOMERS TO PAY FOR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES THEY HAVE PURCHASED. AS A RESULT,

ALLOWANCES FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS AND WRITE-OFFS OF ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE MAY INCREASE.

WE MAINTAIN AN INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO OF VARIOUS

HOLDINGS, TYPES, AND MATURITIES. THESE INVESTMENTS ARE SUBJECT TO GENERAL CREDIT, LIQUIDITY, MARKET, AND INTEREST RATE RISKS, WHICH MAY BE EXACERBATED BY UNUSUAL EVENTS THAT AFFECT GLOBAL FINANCIAL MARKETS. A SIGNIFICANT PART OF OUR INVESTMENT

PORTFOLIO COMPRISES U.S. GOVERNMENT SECURITIES. IF GLOBAL CREDIT AND EQUITY MARKETS DECLINE FOR LONG PERIODS, OR IF THERE IS A DOWNGRADE OF THE U.S. GOVERNMENT CREDIT RATING DUE TO AN ACTUAL OR THREATENED DEFAULT ON GOVERNMENT DEBT, OUR INVESTMENT

PORTFOLIO MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED AND WE COULD DETERMINE THAT MORE OF OUR INVESTMENTS HAVE EXPERIENCED AN OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY DECLINE IN FAIR VALUE, REQUIRING IMPAIRMENT CHARGES THAT COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS.

ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS

WE HAVE RECEIVED NO WRITTEN COMMENTS REGARDING OUR PERIODIC OR CURRENT REPORTS FROM THE STAFF OF THE SEC THAT WERE ISSUED 180 DAYS OR MORE

PRECEDING THE END OF OUR FISCAL YEAR 2016 THAT REMAIN UNRESOLVED.

ITEM 2. PROPERTIES

OUR CORPORATE HEADQUARTERS ARE LOCATED IN REDMOND, WASHINGTON. WE HAVE APPROXIMATELY 15 MILLION SQUARE FEET OF SPACE LOCATED IN KING COUNTY,

WASHINGTON THAT IS USED FOR ENGINEERING, SALES, MARKETING, AND OPERATIONS, AMONG OTHER GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE PURPOSES. THESE FACILITIES INCLUDE APPROXIMATELY 10 MILLION SQUARE FEET OF OWNED SPACE SITUATED ON APPROXIMATELY 500 ACRES OF LAND

WE OWN AT OUR CORPORATE HEADQUARTERS, AND APPROXIMATELY FIVE MILLION SQUARE FEET OF SPACE WE LEASE. IN ADDITION, WE OWN AND LEASE SPACE DOMESTICALLY THAT INCLUDES OFFICE, RETAIL, AND DATACENTER SPACE.

WE ALSO OWN AND LEASE FACILITIES INTERNATIONALLY. PROPERTIES THAT WE OWN INCLUDE: OUR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT CENTERS IN CHINA AND INDIA; OUR

OPERATIONS IN IRELAND AND SINGAPORE; OUR PHONE MANUFACTURING FACILITIES, PREDOMINANTLY IN VIETNAM; AND OUR FACILITIES IN THE UNITED KINGDOM. THE LARGEST LEASED OFFICE SPACES INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING LOCATIONS: FINLAND, CHINA, INDIA, GERMANY, THE UNITED

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

THE FOLLOWING MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (MD&A) IS INTENDED TO HELP THE READER UNDERSTAND THE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

AND FINANCIAL CONDITION OF MICROSOFT CORPORATION. MD&A IS PROVIDED AS A SUPPLEMENT TO, AND SHOULD BE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH, OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND THE ACCOMPANYING NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

OVERVIEW

MICROSOFT IS A

TECHNOLOGY COMPANY WHOSE MISSION IS TO EMPOWER EVERY PERSON AND EVERY ORGANIZATION ON THE PLANET TO ACHIEVE MORE. OUR STRATEGY IS TO BUILD BEST-IN-CLASS PLATFORMS AND PRODUCTIVITY SERVICES FOR A MOBILE-FIRST, CLOUD-FIRST WORLD. WE DEVELOP, LICENSE,

AND SUPPORT A WIDE RANGE OF SOFTWARE PRODUCTS, SERVICES, AND DEVICES THAT DELIVER NEW OPPORTUNITIES, GREATER CONVENIENCE, AND ENHANCED VALUE TO PEOPLES LIVES.

WE GENERATE REVENUE BY LICENSING AND SUPPORTING AN ARRAY OF SOFTWARE PRODUCTS, BY OFFERING A WIDE RANGE OF SERVICES, INCLUDING CLOUD-BASED SERVICES TO CONSUMERS AND BUSINESSES, BY DESIGNING, MANUFACTURING, AND

SELLING DEVICES THAT INTEGRATE WITH OUR CLOUD-BASED SERVICES, AND BY DELIVERING RELEVANT ONLINE ADVERTISING TO A GLOBAL AUDIENCE. OUR MOST SIGNIFICANT EXPENSES ARE RELATED TO COMPENSATING EMPLOYEES; DESIGNING, MANUFACTURING, MARKETING, AND SELLING

OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES; DATACENTER COSTS IN SUPPORT OF OUR CLOUD-BASED SERVICES; AND INCOME TAXES.

MUCH OF OUR FOCUS IN FISCAL YEAR

2016 WAS TOWARD TRANSFORMING OUR ORGANIZATION TO SUPPORT OUR STRATEGY OF BUILDING BEST-IN-CLASS PLATFORMS AND PRODUCTIVITY SERVICES FOR A MOBILE-FIRST, CLOUD-FIRST WORLD. WE ACHIEVED PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT MILESTONES, IMPLEMENTED ORGANIZATIONAL

CHANGES, AND MADE STRATEGIC AND TACTICAL MOVES TO SUPPORT THE THREE CENTRAL AMBITIONS THAT SUPPORT OUR STRATEGY: REINVENTING PRODUCTIVITY AND BUSINESS PROCESSES; BUILDING THE INTELLIGENT CLOUD PLATFORM; AND CREATING MORE PERSONAL COMPUTING.

HIGHLIGHTS FROM FISCAL YEAR 2016 INCLUDED.



COMMERCIAL CLOUD ANNUALIZED REVENUE RUN RATE* EXCEEDED $12.1 BILLION.



OFFICE 365 CONSUMER SUBSCRIBERS INCREASED TO 23.1 MILLION.



MICROSOFT AZURE (AZURE) REVENUE GREW 113%, WITH USAGE OF AZURE COMPUTE AND AZURE SQL DATABASE MORE THAN DOUBLING YEAR-OVER-YEAR. ENTERPRISE



WINDOWS 10 IS NOW ACTIVE ON MORE THAN 350 MILLION DEVICES AROUND THE WORLD.



XBOX LIVE MONTHLY ACTIVE USERS GREW 33% YEAR-OVER-YEAR TO 49 MILLION.

*

COMMERCIAL CLOUD ANNUALIZED REVENUE RUN RATE IS CALCULATED BY MULTIPLYING REVENUE FOR THE LAST MONTH OF THE QUARTER BY TWELVE FOR OFFICE 365 COMMERCIAL,

AZURE, DYNAMICS ONLINE, AND OTHER CLOUD PROPERTIES.

IN JUNE 2016, WE ENTERED INTO A DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT TO

ACQUIRE LINKEDIN FOR $196 PER SHARE IN AN ALL-CASH TRANSACTION VALUED AT $26.2 BILLION, INCLUSIVE OF LINKEDINS NET CASH (THE MERGER AGREEMENT). WE WILL FINANCE THE TRANSACTION PRIMARILY THROUGH THE ISSUANCE OF NEW INDEBTEDNESS. THE

MERGER AGREEMENT HAS BEEN UNANIMOUSLY APPROVED BY THE BOARDS OF DIRECTORS OF BOTH MICROSOFT AND LINKEDIN, AND WE EXPECT THE ACQUISITION WILL CLOSE IN CALENDAR YEAR 2016, SUBJECT TO APPROVAL BY LINKEDINS SHAREHOLDERS, SATISFACTION OF CERTAIN

REGULATORY APPROVALS, AND OTHER CUSTOMARY CLOSING CONDITIONS. THE ACQUISITION IS ANTICIPATED TO ACCELERATE THE GROWTH OF LINKEDIN, AS WELL AS OFFICE 365 AND DYNAMICS.

IN MAY 2016, WE ANNOUNCED THE SALE OF OUR ENTRY-LEVEL FEATURE PHONE BUSINESS FOR $350 MILLION. THE TRANSACTION IS EXPECTED TO CLOSE IN THE SECOND HALF OF 2016, SUBJECT TO REGULATORY APPROVALS AND OTHER CLOSING

CONDITIONS.

IN JULY 2015, WE ANNOUNCED A PLAN TO RESTRUCTURE OUR PHONE BUSINESS TO BETTER FOCUS AND ALIGN RESOURCES. IN MAY 2016, WE

ANNOUNCED PLANS TO FURTHER STREAMLINE OUR SMARTPHONE HARDWARE BUSINESS. THESE CHANGES IN THE PHONE BUSINESS REINFORCE OUR STRATEGY TO CREATE A VIBRANT WINDOWS ECOSYSTEM WITH A SINGLE SET OF EXPERIENCES ACROSS OUR FIRST-PARTY DEVICE FAMILY AND

ORIGINAL EQUIPMENT MANUFACTURER (OEM) OFFERINGS. PART OF THIS STRATEGY INVOLVES FOCUSING OUR PHONE DEVICES ON A NARROWER RANGE OF CUSTOMER CATEGORIES AND DIFFERENTIATING THROUGH THE COMBINATION OF HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE WE ARE UNIQUELY

POSITIONED TO OFFER. AS ANTICIPATED, OUR CHANGE IN PHONE STRATEGY RESULTED IN A REDUCTION IN UNITS SOLD AND ASSOCIATED EXPENSES IN FISCAL YEAR 2016, AND THIS TREND IS EXPECTED TO CONTINUE IN FISCAL YEAR 2017.

INDUSTRY TRENDS

OUR INDUSTRY IS DYNAMIC

AND HIGHLY COMPETITIVE, WITH FREQUENT CHANGES IN BOTH TECHNOLOGIES AND BUSINESS MODELS. EACH INDUSTRY SHIFT IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO CONCEIVE NEW PRODUCTS, NEW TECHNOLOGIES, OR NEW IDEAS THAT CAN FURTHER TRANSFORM THE INDUSTRY AND OUR BUSINESS. AT

MICROSOFT, WE PUSH THE BOUNDARIES OF WHAT IS POSSIBLE THROUGH A BROAD RANGE OF RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES THAT SEEK TO IDENTIFY AND ADDRESS THE CHANGING DEMANDS OF CUSTOMERS AND USERS, INDUSTRY TRENDS, AND COMPETITIVE FORCES.

ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, CHALLENGES, AND RISKS

THE MARKET FOR SOFTWARE, DEVICES, AND CLOUD-BASED SERVICES IS DYNAMIC AND HIGHLY COMPETITIVE. OUR COMPETITORS ARE DEVELOPING NEW SOFTWARE AND

DEVICES, WHILE ALSO DEPLOYING COMPETING CLOUD-BASED SERVICES FOR CONSUMERS AND BUSINESSES. THE DEVICES AND FORM FACTORS CUSTOMERS PREFER EVOLVE RAPIDLY, AND INFLUENCE HOW USERS ACCESS SERVICES IN THE CLOUD, AND IN SOME CASES, THE USERS CHOICE

OF WHICH SUITE OF CLOUD-BASED SERVICES TO USE. WE MUST CONTINUE TO EVOLVE AND ADAPT OVER AN EXTENDED TIME IN PACE WITH THIS CHANGING ENVIRONMENT. THE INVESTMENTS WE ARE MAKING IN DEVICES AND INFRASTRUCTURE WILL CONTINUE TO INCREASE OUR OPERATING

COSTS AND MAY DECREASE OUR OPERATING MARGINS.

OUR SUCCESS IS HIGHLY DEPENDENT ON OUR ABILITY TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN QUALIFIED EMPLOYEES.

WE HIRE A MIX OF UNIVERSITY AND INDUSTRY TALENT WORLDWIDE. MICROSOFT COMPETES FOR TALENTED INDIVIDUALS GLOBALLY BY OFFERING AN EXCEPTIONAL WORKING ENVIRONMENT, BROAD CUSTOMER REACH, SCALE IN RESOURCES, THE ABILITY TO GROW ONES CAREER ACROSS

MANY DIFFERENT PRODUCTS AND BUSINESSES, AND COMPETITIVE COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS. AGGREGATE DEMAND FOR OUR SOFTWARE, SERVICES, AND DEVICES IS CORRELATED TO GLOBAL MACROECONOMIC AND GEOPOLITICAL FACTORS, WHICH REMAIN DYNAMIC.

ITEM 7

OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS PROVIDE A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR TOTAL REVENUE AND EXPENSES. MANY

OF THESE REVENUE AND EXPENSES ARE DENOMINATED IN CURRENCIES OTHER THAN THE U.S. DOLLAR. AS A RESULT, CHANGES IN FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES MAY SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT REVENUE AND EXPENSES. THE STRENGTHENING OF THE U.S. DOLLAR RELATIVE TO CERTAIN FOREIGN

CURRENCIES THROUGHOUT FISCAL YEAR 2015, AND CONTINUING INTO FISCAL YEAR 2016, NEGATIVELY IMPACTED REPORTED REVENUE AND REDUCED REPORTED EXPENSES FROM OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS.

SEE A DISCUSSION OF THESE FACTORS AND OTHER RISKS UNDER RISK FACTORS (PART I, ITEM 1A OF THIS FORM 10-K).

SEASONALITY

OUR REVENUE HISTORICALLY HAS

FLUCTUATED QUARTERLY AND HAS GENERALLY BEEN HIGHEST IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF OUR FISCAL YEAR DUE TO CORPORATE CALENDAR YEAR-END SPENDING TRENDS IN OUR MAJOR MARKETS AND HOLIDAY SEASON SPENDING BY CONSUMERS.

UNEARNED REVENUE

QUARTERLY AND ANNUAL REVENUE IS IMPACTED

BY THE DEFERRAL OF REVENUE, PRIMARILY INCLUDING.



REVENUE DEFERRED ON WINDOWS 10 LICENSES TO REFLECT RATABLE RECOGNITION OVER THE LIFE OF THE DEVICE.



REVENUE DEFERRED ON BUNDLED PRODUCTS AND SERVICES (BUNDLED OFFERINGS).

IF OUR CUSTOMERS CHOOSE TO LICENSE CLOUD-BASED VERSIONS OF OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES RATHER THAN LICENSING TRANSACTION-BASED PRODUCTS AND SERVICES,

THE ASSOCIATED REVENUE WILL SHIFT FROM BEING RECOGNIZED AT THE TIME OF THE TRANSACTION TO BEING RECOGNIZED OVER THE SUBSCRIPTION PERIOD OR UPON CONSUMPTION, AS APPLICABLE.

PRODUCT REVENUE AND SERVICE AND OTHER REVENUE

DUE TO THE GROWTH IN OUR CLOUD-BASED SOLUTIONS,

SERVICE REVENUE EXCEEDED 10% OF TOTAL REVENUE FOR THE FIRST TIME IN FISCAL YEAR 2016. AS A RESULT, WE HAVE SEPARATELY DISCLOSED PRODUCT REVENUE AND SERVICE AND OTHER REVENUE ON OUR CONSOLIDATED INCOME STATEMENTS.

PRODUCT REVENUE INCLUDES SALES FROM OPERATING SYSTEMS; CROSS-DEVICE PRODUCTIVITY APPLICATIONS; SERVER APPLICATIONS; BUSINESS SOLUTION APPLICATIONS;

DESKTOP AND SERVER MANAGEMENT TOOLS; SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT TOOLS; VIDEO GAMES; HARDWARE SUCH AS PCS, TABLETS, GAMING AND ENTERTAINMENT CONSOLES, PHONES, OTHER INTELLIGENT DEVICES, AND RELATED ACCESSORIES; AND TRAINING AND CERTIFICATION OF COMPUTER

SYSTEM INTEGRATORS AND DEVELOPERS.

SERVICE AND OTHER REVENUE INCLUDES SALES FROM CLOUD-BASED SOLUTIONS THAT PROVIDE CUSTOMERS WITH

SOFTWARE, SERVICES, PLATFORMS, AND CONTENT SUCH AS OFFICE 365, AZURE, DYNAMICS CRM ONLINE, AND XBOX LIVE; SOLUTION SUPPORT; AND CONSULTING SERVICES. SERVICE AND OTHER REVENUE ALSO INCLUDES SALES FROM ONLINE ADVERTISING.

REPORTABLE SEGMENTS

THE SEGMENT AMOUNTS

INCLUDED IN MD&A ARE PRESENTED ON A BASIS CONSISTENT WITH OUR INTERNAL MANAGEMENT REPORTING. SEGMENT INFORMATION APPEARING IN NOTE 21  SEGMENT INFORMATION AND GEOGRAPHIC DATA OF THE NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (PART II, ITEM 8 OF

THIS FORM 10-K) IS ALSO PRESENTED ON THIS BASIS. ALL DIFFERENCES BETWEEN OUR INTERNAL MANAGEMENT REPORTING BASIS AND ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES (U.S. GAAP), ALONG WITH CERTAIN CORPORATE-LEVEL AND OTHER

ACTIVITY, ARE INCLUDED IN CORPORATE AND OTHER.

IN JUNE 2015, WE ANNOUNCED A CHANGE IN ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE TO ALIGN TO OUR

STRATEGIC DIRECTION AS A PRODUCTIVITY AND PLATFORM COMPANY. DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL YEAR 2016, OUR CHIEF OPERATING DECISION MAKER, WHO IS ALSO OUR CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, REQUESTED CHANGES IN THE INFORMATION THAT HE REGULARLY REVIEWS FOR

PURPOSES OF ALLOCATING RESOURCES AND ASSESSING PERFORMANCE. AS A RESULT, BEGINNING IN FISCAL YEAR 2016, WE REPORT OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE BASED ON OUR NEW SEGMENTS, PRODUCTIVITY AND BUSINESS PROCESSES, INTELLIGENT CLOUD, AND MORE PERSONAL

COMPUTING, AND ANALYZE OPERATING INCOME AS THE MEASURE OF SEGMENT PROFITABILITY. WE HAVE RECAST CERTAIN PREVIOUSLY REPORTED AMOUNTS TO CONFORM TO THE WAY WE INTERNALLY MANAGE AND MONITOR SEGMENT PERFORMANCE.

WE USE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS TO: MANAGE RISKS RELATED TO FOREIGN CURRENCIES, EQUITY PRICES, INTEREST RATES, AND

CREDIT; ENHANCE INVESTMENT RETURNS; AND FACILITATE PORTFOLIO DIVERSIFICATION. GAINS AND LOSSES FROM CHANGES IN FAIR VALUES OF DERIVATIVES THAT ARE NOT DESIGNATED AS HEDGES ARE PRIMARILY RECOGNIZED IN OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE), NET. OTHER THAN THOSE

DERIVATIVES ENTERED INTO FOR INVESTMENT PURPOSES, SUCH AS COMMODITY CONTRACTS, THE GAINS (LOSSES) ARE GENERALLY ECONOMICALLY OFFSET BY UNREALIZED GAINS (LOSSES) IN THE UNDERLYING AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE SECURITIES AND GAINS (LOSSES) ON CERTAIN BALANCE

SHEET AMOUNTS FROM FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATE CHANGES.

FISCAL YEAR 2016 COMPARED WITH FISCAL YEAR 2015

DIVIDENDS AND INTEREST INCOME INCREASED DUE TO HIGHER PORTFOLIO BALANCES AND SLIGHTLY HIGHER YIELDS ON FIXED-INCOME SECURITIES. INTEREST EXPENSE

INCREASED DUE TO HIGHER OUTSTANDING LONG-TERM DEBT. NET RECOGNIZED GAINS ON INVESTMENTS DECREASED PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENTS AND LOWER GAINS ON SALES OF FIXED-INCOME SECURITIES, OFFSET IN PART BY HIGHER GAINS ON SALES

OF EQUITY SECURITIES. OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENTS WERE $322 MILLION IN FISCAL YEAR 2016, COMPARED WITH $183 MILLION IN FISCAL YEAR 2015. NET LOSSES ON DERIVATIVES INCREASED DUE TO HIGHER LOSSES ON CURRENCY AND EQUITY CONTRACTS AND LOWER GAINS

ON INTEREST RATE CONTRACTS IN THE CURRENT PERIOD AS COMPARED TO THE PRIOR PERIOD, OFFSET IN PART BY LOWER LOSSES ON COMMODITY CONTRACTS. FOR FISCAL YEAR 2016, OTHER REFLECTS RECOGNIZED LOSSES FROM DIVESTITURES AND CERTAIN JOINT VENTURES.

FISCAL YEAR 2015 COMPARED WITH FISCAL YEAR 2014

DIVIDENDS AND INTEREST INCOME DECREASED DUE TO LOWER YIELDS ON FIXED-INCOME SECURITIES, OFFSET IN PART BY HIGHER PORTFOLIO BALANCES. INTEREST EXPENSE INCREASED DUE TO HIGHER OUTSTANDING LONG-TERM DEBT. NET

RECOGNIZED GAINS ON INVESTMENTS INCREASED PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER GAINS ON SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES, OFFSET IN PART BY HIGHER OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENTS. OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENTS WERE $183 MILLION IN FISCAL YEAR 2015, COMPARED WITH

$106 MILLION IN FISCAL YEAR 2014. NET LOSSES ON DERIVATIVES INCREASED DUE TO LOSSES ON COMMODITY CONTRACTS IN FISCAL YEAR 2015 AS COMPARED TO GAINS IN FISCAL YEAR 2014, OFFSET IN PART BY LOWER LOSSES ON CURRENCY AND EQUITY CONTRACTS. FOR FISCAL YEAR

2015, OTHER REFLECTS RECOGNIZED LOSSES FROM CERTAIN JOINT VENTURES AND DIVESTITURES.

INCOME TAXES

FISCAL YEAR 2016 COMPARED WITH FISCAL YEAR 2015

OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR FISCAL YEARS 2016 AND 2015 WAS 15% AND 34%, RESPECTIVELY. OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE WAS LOWER THAN THE U.S. FEDERAL STATUTORY RATE PRIMARILY DUE TO EARNINGS TAXED AT LOWER RATES IN

FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS RESULTING FROM PRODUCING AND DISTRIBUTING OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES THROUGH OUR FOREIGN REGIONAL OPERATIONS CENTERS IN IRELAND, SINGAPORE, AND PUERTO RICO.

THE DECREASE IN OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR FISCAL YEAR 2016 COMPARED TO FISCAL YEAR 2015 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO CHANGES IN THE MIX OF OUR INCOME

BEFORE INCOME TAXES BETWEEN THE U.S. AND FOREIGN COUNTRIES INCLUDING THE IMPACT OF NET

ITEM 7

REVENUE DEFERRALS RELATED TO SALES OF WINDOWS 10, TAX BENEFITS FROM THE ADOPTION OF THE NEW ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE RELATING TO STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION, AND DISTRIBUTIONS FROM FOREIGN AFFILIATES.

THE FISCAL YEAR 2015 EFFECTIVE TAX RATE INCLUDED THE TAX IMPACT OF LOSSES IN FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS FOR WHICH WE MAY NOT REALIZE A TAX BENEFIT, PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF IMPAIRMENT AND RESTRUCTURING CHARGES.

THE MIX OF INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES BETWEEN THE U.S. AND FOREIGN COUNTRIES IMPACTED OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE AS A RESULT OF THE GEOGRAPHIC

DISTRIBUTION OF, AND CUSTOMER DEMAND FOR, OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. WE SUPPLY OUR WINDOWS PC OPERATING SYSTEM TO CUSTOMERS THROUGH OUR U.S. REGIONAL OPERATING CENTER, WHILE WE SUPPLY THE MICROSOFT OFFICE SYSTEM AND OUR SERVER PRODUCTS AND TOOLS TO

CUSTOMERS THROUGH OUR FOREIGN REGIONAL OPERATIONS CENTERS. IN FISCAL YEAR 2016, OUR U.S. LOSS BEFORE INCOME TAXES WAS $325 MILLION AND OUR FOREIGN INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES WAS $20.1 BILLION. NET REVENUE DEFERRALS RELATED TO SALES OF WINDOWS 10

NEGATIVELY IMPACTED OUR FISCAL YEAR 2016 U.S. LOSS BEFORE INCOME TAXES BY $6.0 BILLION AND FOREIGN INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES BY $588 MILLION. IN FISCAL YEAR 2015, OUR U.S. INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES WAS $7.4 BILLION AND OUR FOREIGN INCOME BEFORE

INCOME TAXES WAS $11.1 BILLION. IMPAIRMENT, INTEGRATION, AND RESTRUCTURING EXPENSE RELATING TO OUR PHONE BUSINESS DECREASED OUR FISCAL YEAR 2015 U.S INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES BY $1.1 BILLION AND FOREIGN INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES BY

$8.9 BILLION.

ON JULY 27, 2015, THE U.S. TAX COURT ISSUED AN OPINION IN ALTERA CORP. V. COMMISSIONER RELATED TO THE TREATMENT

OF STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE IN AN INTERCOMPANY COST-SHARING ARRANGEMENT. THE IRSS DECISION TO APPEAL ON FEBRUARY 19, 2016 PROLONGS THE UNCERTAINTY REGARDING THE ULTIMATE OUTCOME OF THE ALTERA CASE, AND WE DO NOT EXPECT TO ADJUST

OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS UNTIL THERE IS A FINAL RESOLUTION OF THIS CASE.

TAX CONTINGENCIES AND OTHER INCOME TAX

LIABILITIES WERE $11.8 BILLION AND $12.1 BILLION AS OF JUNE 30, 2016 AND 2015, RESPECTIVELY, AND ARE INCLUDED IN OTHER LONG-TERM LIABILITIES. THIS DECREASE RELATES PRIMARILY TO TAX CREDITS AVAILABLE FOR CARRYOVER AND A PARTIAL SETTLEMENT OF THE

IRS AUDIT FOR TAX YEARS 2007 TO 2009, OFFSET BY INCREASES RELATING TO INTERCOMPANY TRANSFER PRICING.

WHILE WE SETTLED A PORTION OF THE

IRS AUDIT FOR TAX YEARS 2004 TO 2006 DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL YEAR 2011, AND SETTLED A PORTION OF THE IRS AUDIT FOR TAX YEARS 2007 TO 2009 DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL YEAR 2016, WE REMAIN UNDER AUDIT FOR THOSE YEARS. IN FEBRUARY

2012, THE IRS WITHDREW ITS 2011 REVENUE AGENTS REPORT FOR TAX YEARS 2004 TO 2006 AND REOPENED THE AUDIT PHASE OF THE EXAMINATION. AS OF JUNE 30, 2016, THE PRIMARY UNRESOLVED ISSUE RELATES TO TRANSFER PRICING, WHICH COULD HAVE A SIGNIFICANT

IMPACT ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IF NOT RESOLVED FAVORABLY. WE BELIEVE OUR ALLOWANCES FOR INCOME TAX CONTINGENCIES ARE ADEQUATE. WE HAVE NOT RECEIVED A PROPOSED ASSESSMENT FOR THE UNRESOLVED ISSUES AND DO NOT EXPECT A FINAL RESOLUTION

OF THESE ISSUES IN THE NEXT 12 MONTHS. BASED ON THE INFORMATION CURRENTLY AVAILABLE, WE DO NOT ANTICIPATE A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE OR DECREASE TO OUR TAX CONTINGENCIES FOR THESE ISSUES WITHIN THE NEXT 12 MONTHS. WE ALSO CONTINUE TO BE SUBJECT TO

EXAMINATION BY THE IRS FOR TAX YEARS 2010 TO 2016.

WE ARE SUBJECT TO INCOME TAX IN MANY JURISDICTIONS OUTSIDE THE U.S. OUR OPERATIONS

IN CERTAIN JURISDICTIONS REMAIN SUBJECT TO EXAMINATION FOR TAX YEARS 1996 TO 2016, SOME OF WHICH ARE CURRENTLY UNDER AUDIT BY LOCAL TAX AUTHORITIES. THE RESOLUTIONS OF THESE AUDITS ARE NOT EXPECTED TO BE MATERIAL TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS.

FISCAL YEAR 2015 COMPARED WITH FISCAL YEAR 2014

OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR FISCAL YEARS 2015 AND 2014 WAS 34% AND 21%, RESPECTIVELY. THE FISCAL YEAR 2015 EFFECTIVE RATE INCREASED BY 13%, PRIMARILY DUE TO GOODWILL AND ASSET IMPAIRMENTS AND RESTRUCTURING CHARGES

RECORDED IN FISCAL YEAR 2015, MOST OF WHICH DID NOT GENERATE A TAX BENEFIT. OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE WAS LOWER THAN THE U.S. FEDERAL STATUTORY RATE PRIMARILY DUE TO FOREIGN EARNINGS TAXED AT LOWER RATES RESULTING FROM PRODUCING AND DISTRIBUTING OUR

PRODUCTS AND SERVICES THROUGH OUR FOREIGN REGIONAL OPERATIONS CENTERS IN IRELAND, SINGAPORE, AND PUERTO RICO. IN FISCAL YEAR 2015, THIS REDUCTION WAS MOSTLY OFFSET BY LOSSES IN FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS FOR WHICH WE MAY NOT REALIZE A TAX BENEFIT,

PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF IMPAIRMENT AND RESTRUCTURING CHARGES.

CHANGES IN THE MIX OF INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES BETWEEN THE U.S. AND

FOREIGN COUNTRIES IMPACTED OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE AS A RESULT OF THE GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION OF, AND CUSTOMER DEMAND FOR, OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. WE SUPPLY OUR WINDOWS PC OPERATING SYSTEM TO CUSTOMERS THROUGH OUR U.S. REGIONAL OPERATING CENTER,

WHILE WE SUPPLY

THE MICROSOFT OFFICE SYSTEM AND OUR SERVER PRODUCTS AND TOOLS TO CUSTOMERS THROUGH OUR FOREIGN REGIONAL OPERATIONS CENTERS. IN FISCAL YEARS 2015 AND 2014, OUR U.S. INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES WAS

$7.4 BILLION AND $7.1 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY, AND COMPRISED 40% AND 26%, RESPECTIVELY, OF OUR INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES. IN FISCAL YEARS 2015 AND 2014, OUR FOREIGN INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES WAS $11.1 BILLION AND $20.7 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY, AND

COMPRISED 60% AND 74%, RESPECTIVELY, OF OUR INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES.

FINANCIAL CONDITION

CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS, AND INVESTMENTS

CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS, AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS TOTALED $113.2 BILLION AS OF JUNE 30, 2016, COMPARED WITH $96.5 BILLION AS OF JUNE 30,

2015. EQUITY AND OTHER INVESTMENTS WERE $10.4 BILLION AS OF JUNE 30, 2016, COMPARED WITH $12.1 BILLION AS OF JUNE 30, 2015. OUR SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS ARE PRIMARILY INTENDED TO FACILITATE LIQUIDITY AND FOR CAPITAL PRESERVATION. THEY

CONSIST PREDOMINANTLY OF HIGHLY LIQUID INVESTMENT-GRADE FIXED-INCOME SECURITIES, DIVERSIFIED AMONG INDUSTRIES AND INDIVIDUAL ISSUERS. THE INVESTMENTS ARE PREDOMINANTLY U.S. DOLLAR-DENOMINATED SECURITIES, BUT ALSO INCLUDE FOREIGN CURRENCY-DENOMINATED

SECURITIES IN ORDER TO DIVERSIFY RISK. OUR FIXED-INCOME INVESTMENTS ARE EXPOSED TO INTEREST RATE RISK AND CREDIT RISK. THE CREDIT RISK AND AVERAGE MATURITY OF OUR FIXED-INCOME PORTFOLIO ARE MANAGED TO ACHIEVE ECONOMIC RETURNS THAT CORRELATE TO

CERTAIN FIXED-INCOME INDICES. THE SETTLEMENT RISK RELATED TO THESE INVESTMENTS IS INSIGNIFICANT GIVEN THAT THE SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS HELD ARE PRIMARILY HIGHLY LIQUID INVESTMENT-GRADE FIXED-INCOME SECURITIES.

OF THE CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS, AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS AS OF JUNE 30, 2016, $108.9 BILLION WAS HELD BY OUR FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES AND WOULD

BE SUBJECT TO MATERIAL REPATRIATION TAX EFFECTS. THE AMOUNT OF CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS, AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS HELD BY FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES SUBJECT TO OTHER RESTRICTIONS ON THE FREE FLOW OF FUNDS (PRIMARILY CURRENCY AND OTHER LOCAL REGULATORY)

WAS $2.4 BILLION. AS OF JUNE 30, 2016, APPROXIMATELY 83% OF THE CASH EQUIVALENTS AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS HELD BY OUR FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES WERE INVESTED IN U.S. GOVERNMENT AND AGENCY SECURITIES, APPROXIMATELY 4% WERE INVESTED IN CORPORATE

NOTES AND BONDS OF U.S. COMPANIES, AND APPROXIMATELY 5% WERE INVESTED IN U.S. MORTGAGE- AND ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES, ALL OF WHICH ARE DENOMINATED IN U.S. DOLLARS. THE REMAINING CASH EQUIVALENTS AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS HELD BY OUR FOREIGN

SUBSIDIARIES WERE INVESTED IN FOREIGN SECURITIES.

SECURITIES LENDING

WE LEND CERTAIN FIXED-INCOME AND EQUITY SECURITIES TO INCREASE INVESTMENT RETURNS. THE LOANED SECURITIES CONTINUE TO BE CARRIED AS INVESTMENTS ON OUR CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS. CASH AND/OR SECURITY INTERESTS ARE

RECEIVED AS COLLATERAL FOR THE LOANED SECURITIES WITH THE AMOUNT DETERMINED BASED UPON THE UNDERLYING SECURITY LENT AND THE CREDITWORTHINESS OF THE BORROWER. COLLATERAL RECEIVED IS RECORDED AS AN ASSET WITH A CORRESPONDING LIABILITY. OUR SECURITIES

LENDING PAYABLE BALANCE WAS $294 MILLION AS OF JUNE 30, 2016. OUR AVERAGE AND MAXIMUM SECURITIES LENDING PAYABLE BALANCES FOR FISCAL YEAR 2016 WERE $361 MILLION AND $1.2 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY. INTRA-YEAR VARIANCES IN THE AMOUNT OF SECURITIES

LOANED ARE MAINLY DUE TO FLUCTUATIONS IN THE DEMAND FOR THE SECURITIES.

VALUATION

IN GENERAL, AND WHERE APPLICABLE, WE USE QUOTED PRICES IN ACTIVE MARKETS FOR IDENTICAL ASSETS OR LIABILITIES TO DETERMINE THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS. THIS PRICING METHODOLOGY APPLIES TO OUR LEVEL 1 INVESTMENTS, SUCH AS EXCHANGE-TRADED MUTUAL FUNDS, DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL EQUITIES, AND U.S. GOVERNMENT SECURITIES. IF QUOTED PRICES IN ACTIVE MARKETS FOR IDENTICAL ASSETS OR

LIABILITIES ARE NOT AVAILABLE TO DETERMINE FAIR VALUE, THEN WE USE QUOTED PRICES FOR SIMILAR ASSETS AND LIABILITIES OR INPUTS OTHER THAN THE QUOTED PRICES THAT ARE OBSERVABLE EITHER DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY. THIS PRICING METHODOLOGY APPLIES TO OUR

LEVEL 2 INVESTMENTS SUCH AS CORPORATE NOTES AND BONDS, COMMON AND PREFERRED STOCK, FOREIGN GOVERNMENT BONDS, MORTGAGE- AND ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES, U.S. GOVERNMENT AND AGENCY SECURITIES, AND CERTIFICATES OF DEPOSIT. LEVEL 3 INVESTMENTS ARE VALUED

USING INTERNALLY DEVELOPED MODELS WITH UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS. ASSETS AND LIABILITIES MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE ON A RECURRING BASIS USING UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS ARE AN IMMATERIAL PORTION OF OUR PORTFOLIO.

42

TABLE OF CONTENTS

PART II

ITEM 7

A MAJORITY OF OUR INVESTMENTS ARE PRICED BY PRICING VENDORS AND ARE GENERALLY LEVEL 1 OR LEVEL 2

INVESTMENTS AS THESE VENDORS EITHER PROVIDE A QUOTED MARKET PRICE IN AN ACTIVE MARKET OR USE OBSERVABLE INPUTS FOR THEIR PRICING WITHOUT APPLYING SIGNIFICANT ADJUSTMENTS. BROKER PRICING IS USED MAINLY WHEN A QUOTED PRICE IS NOT AVAILABLE, THE

INVESTMENT IS NOT PRICED BY OUR PRICING VENDORS, OR WHEN A BROKER PRICE IS MORE REFLECTIVE OF FAIR VALUES IN THE MARKET IN WHICH THE INVESTMENT TRADES. OUR BROKER-PRICED INVESTMENTS ARE GENERALLY CLASSIFIED AS LEVEL 2 INVESTMENTS BECAUSE THE BROKER

PRICES THESE INVESTMENTS BASED ON SIMILAR ASSETS WITHOUT APPLYING SIGNIFICANT ADJUSTMENTS. IN ADDITION, ALL OF OUR BROKER-PRICED INVESTMENTS HAVE A SUFFICIENT LEVEL OF TRADING VOLUME TO DEMONSTRATE THAT THE FAIR VALUES USED ARE APPROPRIATE FOR THESE

INVESTMENTS. OUR FAIR VALUE PROCESSES INCLUDE CONTROLS THAT ARE DESIGNED TO ENSURE APPROPRIATE FAIR VALUES ARE RECORDED. THESE CONTROLS INCLUDE MODEL VALIDATION, REVIEW OF KEY MODEL INPUTS, ANALYSIS OF PERIOD-OVER-PERIOD FLUCTUATIONS, AND

INDEPENDENT RECALCULATION OF PRICES WHERE APPROPRIATE.

CASH FLOWS

FISCAL YEAR 2016 COMPARED WITH FISCAL YEAR 2015

CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS INCREASED $3.7

BILLION TO $33.3 BILLION DURING THE FISCAL YEAR, MAINLY DUE TO LOWER OPERATING EXPENDITURES AND A REDUCTION IN MATERIALS AND PRODUCTION COSTS, OFFSET IN PART BY A DECREASE IN CASH RECEIVED FROM CUSTOMERS. CASH USED IN FINANCING DECREASED $1.3

BILLION TO $8.4 BILLION, MAINLY DUE TO A $4.6 BILLION INCREASE IN PROCEEDS FROM ISSUANCES OF DEBT, NET OF REPAYMENTS, OFFSET IN PART BY A $1.5 BILLION INCREASE IN CASH USED FOR COMMON STOCK REPURCHASES AND A $1.1 BILLION INCREASE IN DIVIDENDS PAID.

CASH USED IN INVESTING INCREASED $949 MILLION TO $24.0 BILLION, MAINLY DUE TO A $2.4 BILLION INCREASE IN CASH USED FOR ADDITIONS TO PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT AND A $1.5 BILLION INCREASE IN CASH USED FOR NET INVESTMENT PURCHASES, SALES, AND MATURITIES,

OFFSET IN PART BY A $2.3 BILLION DECREASE IN CASH USED FOR ACQUISITIONS OF COMPANIES, NET OF CASH ACQUIRED, AND PURCHASES OF INTANGIBLES AND OTHER ASSETS.

FISCAL YEAR 2015 COMPARED WITH FISCAL YEAR 2014

CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS DECREASED $2.8

BILLION TO $29.7 BILLION, MAINLY DUE TO AN INCREASE IN MATERIALS AND PRODUCTION COSTS IN SUPPORT OF SALES GROWTH AS WELL AS PAYMENTS RELATED TO RESTRUCTURING CHARGES AND OTHER CHANGES IN WORKING CAPITAL, OFFSET IN PART BY INCREASES IN CASH RECEIVED

FROM CUSTOMERS. CASH USED IN FINANCING INCREASED $1.0 BILLION TO $9.7 BILLION, MAINLY DUE TO A $7.1 BILLION INCREASE IN CASH USED FOR COMMON STOCK REPURCHASES, OFFSET IN PART BY A $6.7 BILLION INCREASE IN PROCEEDS FROM ISSUANCES OF DEBT, NET OF

REPAYMENTS. CASH USED IN INVESTING INCREASED $4.2 BILLION TO $23.0 BILLION, MAINLY DUE TO A $5.5 BILLION INCREASE IN CASH USED FOR NET INVESTMENT PURCHASES, SALES, AND MATURITIES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A $2.2 BILLION DECREASE IN CASH USED FOR

ACQUISITIONS OF COMPANIES, NET OF CASH ACQUIRED, AND PURCHASES OF INTANGIBLE AND OTHER ASSETS.

DEBT

WE ISSUED DEBT TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF FAVORABLE PRICING AND LIQUIDITY IN THE DEBT MARKETS, REFLECTING OUR CREDIT RATING AND THE LOW INTEREST RATE

ENVIRONMENT. THE PROCEEDS OF THESE ISSUANCES WERE OR WILL BE USED FOR GENERAL CORPORATE PURPOSES, WHICH MAY INCLUDE, AMONG OTHER THINGS, FUNDING FOR WORKING CAPITAL, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, REPURCHASES OF CAPITAL STOCK, ACQUISITIONS, AND REPAYMENT OF

EXISTING DEBT. SEE NOTE 12  DEBT OF THE NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (PART II, ITEM 8 OF THIS FORM 10-K) FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION.

UNEARNED REVENUE

UNEARNED REVENUE AS OF

JUNE 30, 2016 WAS COMPRISED MAINLY OF UNEARNED REVENUE FROM VOLUME LICENSING PROGRAMS. UNEARNED REVENUE FROM VOLUME LICENSING PROGRAMS REPRESENTS CUSTOMER BILLINGS FOR MULTI-YEAR LICENSING ARRANGEMENTS PAID FOR EITHER AT INCEPTION OF THE

AGREEMENT OR ANNUALLY AT THE BEGINNING OF EACH COVERAGE PERIOD AND ACCOUNTED FOR AS SUBSCRIPTIONS WITH REVENUE RECOGNIZED RATABLY OVER THE COVERAGE PERIOD. UNEARNED REVENUE AS OF JUNE 30, 2016 ALSO INCLUDED PAYMENTS FOR: WINDOWS 10 LICENSES;

POST-DELIVERY SUPPORT AND CONSULTING SERVICES TO BE PERFORMED IN THE FUTURE; OFFICE 365 SUBSCRIPTIONS; XBOX LIVE SUBSCRIPTIONS; MICROSOFT DYNAMICS BUSINESS SOLUTIONS PRODUCTS; SKYPE PREPAID CREDITS AND SUBSCRIPTIONS; BUNDLED OFFERINGS; AND OTHER

OTHER PLANNED USES OF CAPITAL

IN JUNE

2016, WE ENTERED INTO A DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT TO ACQUIRE LINKEDIN IN AN ALL-CASH TRANSACTION VALUED AT $26.2 BILLION, INCLUSIVE OF LINKEDINS NET CASH. WE EXPECT THE ACQUISITION WILL CLOSE IN CALENDAR YEAR 2016, AND WE WILL FINANCE THE

TRANSACTION PRIMARILY THROUGH THE ISSUANCE OF NEW DEBT.

WE WILL CONTINUE TO INVEST IN SALES, MARKETING, PRODUCT SUPPORT INFRASTRUCTURE,

AND EXISTING AND ADVANCED AREAS OF TECHNOLOGY, AS WELL AS CONTINUE MAKING ACQUISITIONS THAT ALIGN WITH OUR BUSINESS STRATEGY. ADDITIONS TO PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT WILL CONTINUE, INCLUDING NEW FACILITIES, DATACENTERS, AND COMPUTER SYSTEMS FOR RESEARCH

AND DEVELOPMENT, SALES AND MARKETING, SUPPORT, AND ADMINISTRATIVE STAFF. WE EXPECT CAPITAL EXPENDITURES TO INCREASE IN COMING YEARS IN SUPPORT OF OUR PRODUCTIVITY AND PLATFORM STRATEGY. WE HAVE OPERATING LEASES FOR MOST U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL SALES

AND SUPPORT OFFICES AND CERTAIN EQUIPMENT. WE HAVE NOT ENGAGED IN ANY RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS OR ARRANGEMENTS WITH UNCONSOLIDATED ENTITIES OR OTHER PERSONS THAT ARE REASONABLY LIKELY TO MATERIALLY AFFECT LIQUIDITY OR THE AVAILABILITY OF CAPITAL

RESOURCES.

LIQUIDITY

WE EARN A

SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF OUR OPERATING INCOME OUTSIDE THE U.S., WHICH IS DEEMED TO BE PERMANENTLY REINVESTED IN FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS. AS A RESULT, AS DISCUSSED ABOVE UNDER CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS, AND INVESTMENTS, THE MAJORITY OF OUR CASH, CASH

EQUIVALENTS, AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS ARE HELD BY FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES. WE CURRENTLY DO NOT INTEND NOR FORESEE A NEED TO REPATRIATE THESE FUNDS. WE EXPECT EXISTING DOMESTIC CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS, SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS, CASH FLOWS FROM

OPERATIONS, AND ACCESS TO CAPITAL MARKETS TO CONTINUE TO BE SUFFICIENT TO FUND OUR DOMESTIC OPERATING ACTIVITIES AND CASH COMMITMENTS FOR INVESTING AND FINANCING ACTIVITIES, SUCH AS REGULAR QUARTERLY DIVIDENDS, DEBT MATURITIES, AND MATERIAL CAPITAL

EXPENDITURES, FOR AT LEAST THE NEXT 12 MONTHS AND THEREAFTER FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. IN ADDITION, WE EXPECT EXISTING FOREIGN CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS, SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS, AND CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS TO CONTINUE TO BE SUFFICIENT TO FUND OUR

FOREIGN OPERATING ACTIVITIES AND CASH COMMITMENTS FOR INVESTING ACTIVITIES, SUCH AS MATERIAL CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, FOR AT LEAST THE NEXT 12 MONTHS AND THEREAFTER FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

ITEM 7

SHOULD WE REQUIRE MORE CAPITAL IN THE U.S. THAN IS GENERATED BY OUR OPERATIONS DOMESTICALLY, FOR

EXAMPLE TO FUND SIGNIFICANT DISCRETIONARY ACTIVITIES, SUCH AS BUSINESS ACQUISITIONS AND SHARE REPURCHASES, WE COULD ELECT TO REPATRIATE FUTURE EARNINGS FROM FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS OR RAISE CAPITAL IN THE U.S. THROUGH DEBT OR EQUITY ISSUANCES. THESE

ALTERNATIVES COULD RESULT IN HIGHER EFFECTIVE TAX RATES, INCREASED INTEREST EXPENSE, OR DILUTION OF OUR EARNINGS. WE HAVE BORROWED FUNDS DOMESTICALLY AND CONTINUE TO BELIEVE WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO DO SO AT REASONABLE INTEREST RATES.

RECENT ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE

SEE NOTE 1  ACCOUNTING POLICIES OF THE NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (PART II, ITEM 8 OF THIS FORM 10-K) FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION.

APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND ACCOMPANYING NOTES ARE PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH U.S. GAAP. PREPARING CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT

THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS, LIABILITIES, REVENUE, AND EXPENSES. THESE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS ARE AFFECTED BY MANAGEMENTS APPLICATION OF ACCOUNTING POLICIES. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES FOR US INCLUDE REVENUE RECOGNITION, IMPAIRMENT OF

INVESTMENT SECURITIES, GOODWILL, RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS, CONTINGENCIES, INCOME TAXES, AND INVENTORIES.

REVENUE RECOGNITION

REVENUE RECOGNITION FOR MULTIPLE-ELEMENT ARRANGEMENTS REQUIRES JUDGMENT TO DETERMINE IF MULTIPLE ELEMENTS EXIST, WHETHER ELEMENTS CAN BE ACCOUNTED

FOR AS SEPARATE UNITS OF ACCOUNTING, AND IF SO, THE FAIR VALUE FOR EACH OF THE ELEMENTS.

JUDGMENT IS ALSO REQUIRED TO ASSESS WHETHER

FUTURE RELEASES OF CERTAIN SOFTWARE REPRESENT NEW PRODUCTS OR UPGRADES AND ENHANCEMENTS TO EXISTING PRODUCTS. CERTAIN VOLUME LICENSING ARRANGEMENTS INCLUDE A PERPETUAL LICENSE FOR CURRENT PRODUCTS COMBINED WITH RIGHTS TO RECEIVE UNSPECIFIED FUTURE

VERSIONS OF SOFTWARE PRODUCTS AND ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AS SUBSCRIPTIONS, WITH BILLINGS RECORDED AS UNEARNED REVENUE AND RECOGNIZED AS REVENUE RATABLY OVER THE COVERAGE PERIOD.

SOFTWARE UPDATES ARE EVALUATED ON A CASE-BY-CASE BASIS TO DETERMINE WHETHER THEY MEET THE DEFINITION OF AN UPGRADE, WHICH MAY REQUIRE REVENUE TO BE DEFERRED AND RECOGNIZED WHEN THE UPGRADE IS DELIVERED. IF IT IS

DETERMINED THAT IMPLIED POST-CONTRACT CUSTOMER SUPPORT (PCS) IS BEING PROVIDED, REVENUE FROM THE ARRANGEMENT IS DEFERRED AND RECOGNIZED OVER THE IMPLIED PCS TERM. IF UPDATES ARE DETERMINED TO NOT MEET THE DEFINITION OF AN UPGRADE,

REVENUE IS GENERALLY RECOGNIZED AS PRODUCTS ARE SHIPPED OR MADE AVAILABLE.

MICROSOFT ENTERS INTO ARRANGEMENTS THAT CAN INCLUDE VARIOUS

COMBINATIONS OF SOFTWARE, SERVICES, AND HARDWARE. WHERE ELEMENTS ARE DELIVERED OVER DIFFERENT PERIODS OF TIME, AND WHEN ALLOWED UNDER U.S. GAAP, REVENUE IS ALLOCATED TO THE RESPECTIVE ELEMENTS BASED ON THEIR RELATIVE SELLING PRICES AT THE INCEPTION

OF THE ARRANGEMENT, AND REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED AS EACH ELEMENT IS DELIVERED. WE USE A HIERARCHY TO DETERMINE THE FAIR VALUE TO BE USED FOR ALLOCATING REVENUE TO ELEMENTS: (I) VENDOR-SPECIFIC OBJECTIVE EVIDENCE OF FAIR VALUE (VSOE), (II)

THIRD-PARTY EVIDENCE, AND (III) BEST ESTIMATE OF SELLING PRICE (ESP). FOR SOFTWARE ELEMENTS, WE FOLLOW THE INDUSTRY-SPECIFIC SOFTWARE GUIDANCE WHICH ONLY ALLOWS FOR THE USE OF VSOE IN ESTABLISHING FAIR VALUE. GENERALLY, VSOE IS THE PRICE

CHARGED WHEN THE DELIVERABLE IS SOLD SEPARATELY OR THE PRICE ESTABLISHED BY MANAGEMENT FOR A PRODUCT THAT IS NOT YET SOLD IF IT IS PROBABLE THAT THE PRICE WILL NOT CHANGE BEFORE INTRODUCTION INTO THE MARKETPLACE. ESPS ARE ESTABLISHED AS BEST

ESTIMATES OF WHAT THE SELLING PRICES WOULD BE IF THE DELIVERABLES WERE SOLD REGULARLY ON A STAND-ALONE BASIS. OUR PROCESS FOR DETERMINING ESPS REQUIRES JUDGMENT AND CONSIDERS MULTIPLE FACTORS THAT MAY VARY OVER TIME DEPENDING UPON THE UNIQUE FACTS

AND CIRCUMSTANCES RELATED TO EACH DELIVERABLE.

IN JANUARY 2015, WE ANNOUNCED WINDOWS 10 WOULD BE FREE TO ALL QUALIFIED EXISTING USERS

OF WINDOWS 7 AND WINDOWS 8.1. THIS OFFER DIFFERS FROM HISTORICAL OFFERS PRECEDING THE LAUNCH OF NEW VERSIONS OF WINDOWS AS IT IS BEING MADE

TABLE OF CONTENTS

PART II

ITEM 7

AVAILABLE FOR FREE TO EXISTING USERS IN ADDITION TO NEW CUSTOMERS AFTER THE OFFER ANNOUNCEMENT. WE EVALUATED THE NATURE AND ACCOUNTING TREATMENT OF THE WINDOWS 10 OFFER AND DETERMINED THAT IT

REPRESENTS A MARKETING AND PROMOTIONAL ACTIVITY, IN PART BECAUSE THE OFFER IS BEING MADE AVAILABLE FOR FREE TO EXISTING USERS. AS THIS IS A MARKETING AND PROMOTIONAL ACTIVITY, REVENUE RECOGNITION OF NEW SALES OF WINDOWS 8 WILL CONTINUE TO BE

RECOGNIZED AS DELIVERED.

CUSTOMERS PURCHASING A WINDOWS 10 LICENSE WILL RECEIVE UNSPECIFIED UPDATES AND UPGRADES OVER THE LIFE OF THEIR

WINDOWS 10 DEVICE AT NO ADDITIONAL COST. AS THESE UPDATES AND UPGRADES WILL NOT BE SOLD ON A STAND-ALONE BASIS, WE ARE UNABLE TO ESTABLISH VSOE. ACCORDINGLY, REVENUE FROM LICENSES OF WINDOWS 10 IS RECOGNIZED RATABLY OVER THE ESTIMATED LIFE OF THE

RELATED DEVICE, WHICH RANGES BETWEEN TWO TO FOUR YEARS.

WE CURRENTLY ARE EVALUATING THE IMPACT OF THE NEW STANDARD RELATED TO REVENUE

RECOGNITION, WHICH WE ANTICIPATE WILL HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. SEE NOTE 1  ACCOUNTING POLICIES OF THE NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (PART II, ITEM 8 OF THIS FORM 10-K) FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION.

IMPAIRMENT OF INVESTMENT SECURITIES

WE REVIEW INVESTMENTS QUARTERLY FOR INDICATORS OF OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENT. THIS DETERMINATION REQUIRES SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT. IN MAKING THIS JUDGMENT, WE EMPLOY A SYSTEMATIC METHODOLOGY QUARTERLY THAT

CONSIDERS AVAILABLE QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE EVIDENCE IN EVALUATING POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT OF OUR INVESTMENTS. IF THE COST OF AN INVESTMENT EXCEEDS ITS FAIR VALUE, WE EVALUATE, AMONG OTHER FACTORS, GENERAL MARKET CONDITIONS, CREDIT QUALITY OF DEBT

INSTRUMENT ISSUERS, THE DURATION AND EXTENT TO WHICH THE FAIR VALUE IS LESS THAN COST, AND FOR EQUITY SECURITIES, OUR INTENT AND ABILITY TO HOLD, OR PLANS TO SELL, THE INVESTMENT. FOR FIXED-INCOME SECURITIES, WE ALSO EVALUATE WHETHER WE HAVE PLANS

TO SELL THE SECURITY OR IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT WE WILL BE REQUIRED TO SELL THE SECURITY BEFORE RECOVERY. WE ALSO CONSIDER SPECIFIC ADVERSE CONDITIONS RELATED TO THE FINANCIAL HEALTH OF AND BUSINESS OUTLOOK FOR THE INVESTEE, INCLUDING

INDUSTRY AND SECTOR PERFORMANCE, CHANGES IN TECHNOLOGY, AND OPERATIONAL AND FINANCING CASH FLOW FACTORS. ONCE A DECLINE IN FAIR VALUE IS DETERMINED TO BE OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY, AN IMPAIRMENT CHARGE IS RECORDED TO OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE), NET AND A NEW

COST BASIS IN THE INVESTMENT IS ESTABLISHED. IF MARKET, INDUSTRY, AND/OR INVESTEE CONDITIONS DETERIORATE, WE MAY INCUR FUTURE IMPAIRMENTS.

GOODWILL

WE ALLOCATE GOODWILL TO REPORTING UNITS BASED ON THE REPORTING UNIT EXPECTED TO BENEFIT FROM THE BUSINESS COMBINATION. WE EVALUATE

OUR REPORTING UNITS ON AN ANNUAL BASIS AND, IF NECESSARY, REASSIGN GOODWILL USING A RELATIVE FAIR VALUE ALLOCATION APPROACH. GOODWILL IS TESTED FOR IMPAIRMENT AT THE REPORTING UNIT LEVEL (OPERATING SEGMENT OR ONE LEVEL BELOW AN OPERATING SEGMENT) ON

AN ANNUAL BASIS (MAY 1 FOR US) AND BETWEEN ANNUAL TESTS IF AN EVENT OCCURS OR CIRCUMSTANCES CHANGE THAT WOULD MORE LIKELY THAN NOT REDUCE THE FAIR VALUE OF A REPORTING UNIT BELOW ITS CARRYING VALUE. THESE EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES COULD INCLUDE A

SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN THE BUSINESS CLIMATE, LEGAL FACTORS, OPERATING PERFORMANCE INDICATORS, COMPETITION, OR SALE OR DISPOSITION OF A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF A REPORTING UNIT.

APPLICATION OF THE GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT TEST REQUIRES JUDGMENT, INCLUDING THE IDENTIFICATION OF REPORTING UNITS, ASSIGNMENT OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES TO REPORTING UNITS, ASSIGNMENT OF GOODWILL TO REPORTING UNITS,

AND DETERMINATION OF THE FAIR VALUE OF EACH REPORTING UNIT. THE FAIR VALUE OF EACH REPORTING UNIT IS ESTIMATED PRIMARILY THROUGH THE USE OF A DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW METHODOLOGY. THIS ANALYSIS REQUIRES SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENTS, INCLUDING ESTIMATION OF

FUTURE CASH FLOWS, WHICH IS DEPENDENT ON INTERNAL FORECASTS, ESTIMATION OF THE LONG-TERM RATE OF GROWTH FOR OUR BUSINESS, ESTIMATION OF THE USEFUL LIFE OVER WHICH CASH FLOWS WILL OCCUR, AND DETERMINATION OF OUR WEIGHTED AVERAGE COST OF CAPITAL.

THE ESTIMATES USED TO CALCULATE THE FAIR VALUE OF A REPORTING UNIT CHANGE FROM YEAR TO YEAR BASED ON OPERATING RESULTS, MARKET

CONDITIONS, AND OTHER FACTORS. CHANGES IN THESE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS COULD MATERIALLY AFFECT THE DETERMINATION OF FAIR VALUE AND GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT FOR EACH REPORTING UNIT.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS

COSTS INCURRED INTERNALLY IN RESEARCHING AND DEVELOPING A COMPUTER SOFTWARE PRODUCT ARE CHARGED TO EXPENSE UNTIL TECHNOLOGICAL FEASIBILITY HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED FOR THE PRODUCT. ONCE TECHNOLOGICAL FEASIBILITY IS

ESTABLISHED, ALL SOFTWARE COSTS ARE CAPITALIZED UNTIL THE PRODUCT IS AVAILABLE FOR GENERAL RELEASE TO CUSTOMERS. JUDGMENT IS REQUIRED IN DETERMINING WHEN TECHNOLOGICAL FEASIBILITY OF A PRODUCT IS ESTABLISHED. WE HAVE DETERMINED THAT TECHNOLOGICAL

FEASIBILITY FOR OUR SOFTWARE PRODUCTS IS REACHED AFTER ALL HIGH-RISK DEVELOPMENT ISSUES HAVE BEEN RESOLVED THROUGH CODING AND TESTING. GENERALLY, THIS OCCURS SHORTLY BEFORE THE PRODUCTS ARE RELEASED TO MANUFACTURING. THE AMORTIZATION OF THESE COSTS

IS INCLUDED IN COST OF REVENUE OVER THE ESTIMATED LIFE OF THE PRODUCTS.

LEGAL AND OTHER CONTINGENCIES

THE OUTCOMES OF LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND CLAIMS BROUGHT AGAINST US ARE SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT UNCERTAINTY. AN ESTIMATED LOSS FROM A LOSS CONTINGENCY

SUCH AS A LEGAL PROCEEDING OR CLAIM IS ACCRUED BY A CHARGE TO INCOME IF IT IS PROBABLE THAT AN ASSET HAS BEEN IMPAIRED OR A LIABILITY HAS BEEN INCURRED AND THE AMOUNT OF THE LOSS CAN BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED. IN DETERMINING WHETHER A LOSS SHOULD BE

ACCRUED WE EVALUATE, AMONG OTHER FACTORS, THE DEGREE OF PROBABILITY OF AN UNFAVORABLE OUTCOME AND THE ABILITY TO MAKE A REASONABLE ESTIMATE OF THE AMOUNT OF LOSS. CHANGES IN THESE FACTORS COULD MATERIALLY IMPACT OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS.

INCOME TAXES

THE

OBJECTIVES OF ACCOUNTING FOR INCOME TAXES ARE TO RECOGNIZE THE AMOUNT OF TAXES PAYABLE OR REFUNDABLE FOR THE CURRENT YEAR AND DEFERRED TAX LIABILITIES AND ASSETS FOR THE FUTURE TAX CONSEQUENCES OF EVENTS THAT HAVE BEEN RECOGNIZED IN AN ENTITYS

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OR TAX RETURNS. WE RECOGNIZE THE TAX BENEFIT FROM AN UNCERTAIN TAX POSITION ONLY IF IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT THE TAX POSITION WILL BE SUSTAINED ON EXAMINATION BY THE TAXING AUTHORITIES, BASED ON THE TECHNICAL MERITS OF

THE POSITION. THE TAX BENEFITS RECOGNIZED IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FROM SUCH A POSITION ARE MEASURED BASED ON THE LARGEST BENEFIT THAT HAS A GREATER THAN 50% LIKELIHOOD OF BEING REALIZED UPON ULTIMATE SETTLEMENT. ACCOUNTING LITERATURE ALSO

PROVIDES GUIDANCE ON DERECOGNITION OF INCOME TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, CLASSIFICATION OF DEFERRED INCOME TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, ACCOUNTING FOR INTEREST AND PENALTIES ASSOCIATED WITH TAX POSITIONS, AND INCOME TAX DISCLOSURES. JUDGMENT IS

REQUIRED IN ASSESSING THE FUTURE TAX CONSEQUENCES OF EVENTS THAT HAVE BEEN RECOGNIZED ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OR TAX RETURNS. VARIATIONS IN THE ACTUAL OUTCOME OF THESE FUTURE TAX CONSEQUENCES COULD MATERIALLY IMPACT OUR CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

INVENTORIES

INVENTORIES ARE STATED AT AVERAGE COST, SUBJECT TO THE LOWER OF COST OR MARKET. COST INCLUDES MATERIALS, LABOR, AND MANUFACTURING OVERHEAD RELATED TO THE PURCHASE AND PRODUCTION OF INVENTORIES. WE REGULARLY REVIEW

INVENTORY QUANTITIES ON HAND, FUTURE PURCHASE COMMITMENTS WITH OUR SUPPLIERS, AND THE ESTIMATED UTILITY OF OUR INVENTORY. THESE REVIEWS INCLUDE ANALYSIS OF DEMAND FORECASTS, PRODUCT LIFE CYCLE STATUS, PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT PLANS, CURRENT SALES LEVELS,

PRICING STRATEGY, AND COMPONENT COST TRENDS. IF OUR REVIEW INDICATES A REDUCTION IN UTILITY BELOW CARRYING VALUE, WE REDUCE OUR INVENTORY TO A NEW COST BASIS THROUGH A CHARGE TO COST OF REVENUE.

STATEMENT OF MANAGEMENTS RESPONSIBILITY FOR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

MANAGEMENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE PREPARATION OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND RELATED INFORMATION THAT ARE PRESENTED IN THIS REPORT.

THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, WHICH INCLUDE AMOUNTS BASED ON MANAGEMENTS ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS, HAVE BEEN PREPARED IN CONFORMITY WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.

THE COMPANY DESIGNS AND MAINTAINS ACCOUNTING AND INTERNAL CONTROL SYSTEMS TO PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE AT REASONABLE COST THAT ASSETS ARE

SAFEGUARDED AGAINST LOSS FROM UNAUTHORIZED USE OR DISPOSITION, AND THAT THE FINANCIAL RECORDS ARE RELIABLE FOR PREPARING CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND MAINTAINING ACCOUNTABILITY FOR ASSETS. THESE SYSTEMS ARE AUGMENTED BY WRITTEN POLICIES, AN

ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE PROVIDING DIVISION OF RESPONSIBILITIES, CAREFUL SELECTION AND TRAINING OF QUALIFIED PERSONNEL, AND A PROGRAM OF INTERNAL AUDITS.

THE COMPANY ENGAGED DELOITTE & TOUCHE LLP, AN INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM, TO AUDIT AND RENDER AN OPINION ON THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL

REPORTING IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE STANDARDS OF THE PUBLIC COMPANY ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BOARD (UNITED STATES).

ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT

MARKET RISK

RISKS

WE ARE EXPOSED TO ECONOMIC RISK FROM FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES, INTEREST RATES, CREDIT RISK, EQUITY PRICES, AND COMMODITY PRICES. A PORTION OF THESE RISKS IS HEDGED, BUT THEY MAY IMPACT OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS.

FOREIGN CURRENCY

CERTAIN FORECASTED TRANSACTIONS, ASSETS, AND LIABILITIES ARE EXPOSED TO FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK. WE MONITOR OUR FOREIGN CURRENCY EXPOSURES DAILY AND

USE HEDGES WHERE PRACTICABLE TO OFFSET THE RISKS AND MAXIMIZE THE ECONOMIC EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR FOREIGN CURRENCY POSITIONS. PRINCIPAL CURRENCIES HEDGED INCLUDE THE EURO, JAPANESE YEN, BRITISH POUND, CANADIAN DOLLAR, AND AUSTRALIAN DOLLAR.

INTEREST RATE

OUR FIXED-INCOME

PORTFOLIO IS DIVERSIFIED ACROSS CREDIT SECTORS AND MATURITIES, CONSISTING PRIMARILY OF INVESTMENT-GRADE SECURITIES. THE CREDIT RISK AND AVERAGE MATURITY OF THE FIXED-INCOME PORTFOLIO IS MANAGED TO ACHIEVE ECONOMIC RETURNS THAT CORRELATE TO CERTAIN

GLOBAL AND DOMESTIC FIXED-INCOME INDICES. IN ADDITION, WE USE TO BE ANNOUNCED FORWARD PURCHASE COMMITMENTS OF MORTGAGE-BACKED ASSETS TO GAIN EXPOSURE TO AGENCY MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES.

EQUITY

OUR EQUITY PORTFOLIO CONSISTS OF

GLOBAL, DEVELOPED, AND EMERGING MARKET SECURITIES THAT ARE SUBJECT TO MARKET PRICE RISK. WE MANAGE THE SECURITIES RELATIVE TO CERTAIN GLOBAL AND DOMESTIC INDICES AND EXPECT THEIR ECONOMIC RISK AND RETURN TO CORRELATE WITH THESE INDICES.

COMMODITY

WE USE BROAD-BASED

COMMODITY EXPOSURES TO ENHANCE PORTFOLIO RETURNS AND FACILITATE PORTFOLIO DIVERSIFICATION. OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO HAS EXPOSURE TO A VARIETY OF COMMODITIES, INCLUDING PRECIOUS METALS, ENERGY, AND GRAIN. WE MANAGE THESE EXPOSURES RELATIVE TO GLOBAL

COMMODITY INDICES AND EXPECT THEIR ECONOMIC RISK AND RETURN TO CORRELATE WITH THESE INDICES.

VALUE-AT-RISK

WE USE A VALUE-AT-RISK (VAR) MODEL TO ESTIMATE AND QUANTIFY OUR MARKET RISKS. VAR IS THE EXPECTED LOSS, FOR A GIVEN CONFIDENCE LEVEL,

IN THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR PORTFOLIO DUE TO ADVERSE MARKET MOVEMENTS OVER A DEFINED TIME HORIZON. THE VAR MODEL IS NOT INTENDED TO REPRESENT ACTUAL LOSSES IN FAIR VALUE, INCLUDING DETERMINATIONS OF OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY LOSSES IN FAIR VALUE IN

ACCORDANCE WITH U.S. GAAP, BUT IS USED AS A RISK ESTIMATION AND MANAGEMENT TOOL. THE DISTRIBUTION OF THE POTENTIAL CHANGES IN TOTAL MARKET VALUE OF ALL HOLDINGS IS COMPUTED BASED ON THE HISTORICAL VOLATILITIES AND CORRELATIONS AMONG FOREIGN EXCHANGE

RATES, INTEREST RATES, EQUITY PRICES, AND COMMODITY PRICES, ASSUMING NORMAL MARKET CONDITIONS.

THE VAR IS CALCULATED AS THE TOTAL LOSS

THAT WILL NOT BE EXCEEDED AT THE 97.5 PERCENTILE CONFIDENCE LEVEL OR, ALTERNATIVELY STATED, THE LOSSES COULD EXCEED THE VAR IN 25 OUT OF 1,000 CASES. SEVERAL RISK FACTORS ARE NOT CAPTURED IN THE MODEL, INCLUDING LIQUIDITY RISK, OPERATIONAL RISK, AND

LEGAL RISK.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 1  ACCOUNTING POLICIES

ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES

THE CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND ACCOMPANYING NOTES ARE PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA (U.S. GAAP).

WE HAVE RECAST CERTAIN PRIOR PERIOD AMOUNTS TO CONFORM TO THE CURRENT PERIOD PRESENTATION, WITH NO IMPACT ON CONSOLIDATED NET INCOME OR CASH FLOWS.

PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION

THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDE THE ACCOUNTS OF

MICROSOFT CORPORATION AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES. INTERCOMPANY TRANSACTIONS AND BALANCES HAVE BEEN ELIMINATED. EQUITY INVESTMENTS THROUGH WHICH WE ARE ABLE TO EXERCISE SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE OVER BUT DO NOT CONTROL THE INVESTEE AND ARE NOT THE PRIMARY

BENEFICIARY OF THE INVESTEES ACTIVITIES ARE ACCOUNTED FOR USING THE EQUITY METHOD. INVESTMENTS THROUGH WHICH WE ARE NOT ABLE TO EXERCISE SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE OVER THE INVESTEE AND WHICH DO NOT HAVE READILY DETERMINABLE FAIR VALUES ARE

ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER THE COST METHOD.

SEGMENT INFORMATION

IN JUNE 2015, WE ANNOUNCED A CHANGE IN ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE TO ALIGN TO OUR STRATEGIC DIRECTION AS A PRODUCTIVITY AND PLATFORM COMPANY. DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL YEAR 2016, OUR CHIEF OPERATING DECISION

MAKER, WHO IS ALSO OUR CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, REQUESTED CHANGES IN THE INFORMATION THAT HE REGULARLY REVIEWS FOR PURPOSES OF ALLOCATING RESOURCES AND ASSESSING PERFORMANCE. AS A RESULT, BEGINNING IN FISCAL YEAR 2016, WE REPORT OUR FINANCIAL

PERFORMANCE BASED ON OUR NEW SEGMENTS DESCRIBED IN NOTE 21  SEGMENT INFORMATION AND GEOGRAPHIC DATA. WE HAVE RECAST CERTAIN PRIOR PERIOD AMOUNTS TO CONFORM TO THE WAY WE INTERNALLY MANAGE AND MONITOR SEGMENT PERFORMANCE DURING FISCAL YEAR

2016. THIS CHANGE PRIMARILY IMPACTED NOTE 10  GOODWILL, NOTE 15  UNEARNED REVENUE, AND NOTE 21  SEGMENT INFORMATION AND GEOGRAPHIC DATA, WITH NO IMPACT ON CONSOLIDATED NET INCOME OR CASH FLOWS.

ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS

PREPARING

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS, LIABILITIES, REVENUE, AND EXPENSES. EXAMPLES OF ESTIMATES INCLUDE: LOSS CONTINGENCIES; PRODUCT WARRANTIES; THE FAIR VALUE OF,

AND/OR POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT OF GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS, FOR OUR REPORTING UNITS; PRODUCT LIFE CYCLES; USEFUL LIVES OF OUR TANGIBLE AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS; ALLOWANCES FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS; ALLOWANCES FOR PRODUCT RETURNS; THE MARKET VALUE OF

AND VOLUME OF DEMAND FOR OUR INVENTORY; AND STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION FORFEITURE RATES. EXAMPLES OF ASSUMPTIONS INCLUDE: THE ELEMENTS COMPRISING A SOFTWARE ARRANGEMENT, INCLUDING THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN UPGRADES OR ENHANCEMENTS AND NEW PRODUCTS; WHEN

TECHNOLOGICAL FEASIBILITY IS ACHIEVED FOR OUR PRODUCTS; THE POTENTIAL OUTCOME OF FUTURE TAX CONSEQUENCES OF EVENTS THAT HAVE BEEN RECOGNIZED ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OR TAX RETURNS; AND DETERMINING WHEN INVESTMENT IMPAIRMENTS ARE

OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY. ACTUAL RESULTS AND OUTCOMES MAY DIFFER FROM MANAGEMENTS ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS.

FOREIGN CURRENCIES

ASSETS AND LIABILITIES RECORDED IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES ARE TRANSLATED AT THE EXCHANGE RATE ON THE BALANCE SHEET DATE. REVENUE AND EXPENSES ARE

TRANSLATED AT AVERAGE RATES OF EXCHANGE PREVAILING DURING THE YEAR. TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENTS RESULTING FROM THIS PROCESS ARE RECORDED TO OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (OCI).

PRODUCT REVENUE AND SERVICE AND OTHER REVENUE

SERVICE REVENUE EXCEEDED 10% OF TOTAL REVENUE FOR THE FIRST TIME IN FISCAL YEAR 2016. AS A RESULT, WE HAVE SEPARATELY DISCLOSED PRODUCT REVENUE AND

SERVICE AND OTHER REVENUE ON OUR CONSOLIDATED INCOME STATEMENTS.

PRODUCT REVENUE INCLUDES SALES FROM OPERATING SYSTEMS; CROSS-DEVICE

PRODUCTIVITY APPLICATIONS; SERVER APPLICATIONS; BUSINESS SOLUTION APPLICATIONS; DESKTOP AND SERVER MANAGEMENT TOOLS; SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT TOOLS; VIDEO GAMES; HARDWARE SUCH AS PCS, TABLETS, GAMING AND ENTERTAINMENT CONSOLES, PHONES, OTHER INTELLIGENT

DEVICES, AND RELATED ACCESSORIES; AND TRAINING AND CERTIFICATION OF COMPUTER SYSTEM INTEGRATORS AND DEVELOPERS.

SERVICE AND OTHER

REVENUE INCLUDES SALES FROM CLOUD-BASED SOLUTIONS THAT PROVIDE CUSTOMERS WITH SOFTWARE, SERVICES, PLATFORMS, AND CONTENT SUCH AS OFFICE 365, MICROSOFT AZURE (AZURE), MICROSOFT DYNAMICS (DYNAMICS) CRM ONLINE, AND XBOX LIVE;

SOLUTION SUPPORT; AND CONSULTING SERVICES. SERVICE AND OTHER REVENUE ALSO INCLUDES SALES FROM ONLINE ADVERTISING.

REVENUE RECOGNITION

REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED WHEN PERSUASIVE EVIDENCE OF AN ARRANGEMENT EXISTS, DELIVERY HAS OCCURRED, THE FEE IS FIXED OR DETERMINABLE,

AND COLLECTABILITY IS PROBABLE. REVENUE GENERALLY IS RECOGNIZED NET OF ALLOWANCES FOR RETURNS AND ANY TAXES COLLECTED FROM CUSTOMERS AND SUBSEQUENTLY REMITTED TO GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORITIES.

REVENUE RECOGNITION FOR MULTIPLE-ELEMENT ARRANGEMENTS REQUIRES JUDGMENT TO DETERMINE IF MULTIPLE ELEMENTS EXIST, WHETHER ELEMENTS CAN BE ACCOUNTED

FOR AS SEPARATE UNITS OF ACCOUNTING, AND IF SO, THE FAIR VALUE FOR EACH OF THE ELEMENTS.

MICROSOFT ENTERS INTO ARRANGEMENTS THAT CAN

INCLUDE VARIOUS COMBINATIONS OF SOFTWARE, SERVICES, AND HARDWARE. WHERE ELEMENTS ARE DELIVERED OVER DIFFERENT PERIODS OF TIME, AND WHEN ALLOWED UNDER U.S. GAAP, REVENUE IS ALLOCATED TO THE RESPECTIVE ELEMENTS BASED ON THEIR RELATIVE SELLING PRICES

AT THE INCEPTION OF THE ARRANGEMENT, AND REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED AS EACH ELEMENT IS DELIVERED. WE USE A HIERARCHY TO DETERMINE THE FAIR VALUE TO BE USED FOR ALLOCATING REVENUE TO ELEMENTS: (I) VENDOR-SPECIFIC OBJECTIVE EVIDENCE OF FAIR VALUE

(VSOE), (II) THIRD-PARTY EVIDENCE, AND (III) BEST ESTIMATE OF SELLING PRICE (ESP). FOR SOFTWARE ELEMENTS, WE FOLLOW THE INDUSTRY SPECIFIC SOFTWARE GUIDANCE WHICH ONLY ALLOWS FOR THE USE OF VSOE IN ESTABLISHING FAIR

VALUE. GENERALLY, VSOE IS THE PRICE CHARGED WHEN THE DELIVERABLE IS SOLD SEPARATELY OR THE PRICE ESTABLISHED BY MANAGEMENT FOR A PRODUCT THAT IS NOT YET SOLD IF IT IS PROBABLE THAT THE PRICE WILL NOT CHANGE BEFORE INTRODUCTION INTO THE MARKETPLACE.

ESPS ARE ESTABLISHED AS BEST ESTIMATES OF WHAT THE SELLING PRICES WOULD BE IF THE DELIVERABLES WERE SOLD REGULARLY ON A STAND-ALONE BASIS. OUR PROCESS FOR DETERMINING ESPS REQUIRES JUDGMENT AND CONSIDERS MULTIPLE FACTORS THAT MAY VARY OVER TIME

DEPENDING UPON THE UNIQUE FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES RELATED TO EACH DELIVERABLE.

REVENUE FOR RETAIL PACKAGED PRODUCTS, PRODUCTS LICENSED

TO ORIGINAL EQUIPMENT MANUFACTURERS (OEMS), AND PERPETUAL LICENSES UNDER CERTAIN VOLUME LICENSING PROGRAMS GENERALLY IS RECOGNIZED AS PRODUCTS ARE SHIPPED OR MADE AVAILABLE.

TECHNOLOGY GUARANTEE PROGRAMS ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AS MULTIPLE-ELEMENT ARRANGEMENTS AS CUSTOMERS RECEIVE FREE OR SIGNIFICANTLY DISCOUNTED RIGHTS TO

USE UPCOMING NEW VERSIONS OF A SOFTWARE PRODUCT IF THEY LICENSE EXISTING VERSIONS OF THE PRODUCT DURING THE ELIGIBILITY PERIOD. REVENUE IS ALLOCATED BETWEEN THE EXISTING PRODUCT AND THE NEW PRODUCT, AND REVENUE ALLOCATED TO THE NEW PRODUCT IS

DEFERRED UNTIL THAT VERSION IS DELIVERED. THE REVENUE ALLOCATION IS BASED ON THE VSOE OF FAIR VALUE OF THE PRODUCTS. THE VSOE OF FAIR VALUE FOR UPCOMING NEW PRODUCTS ARE BASED ON THE PRICE DETERMINED BY MANAGEMENT HAVING THE RELEVANT AUTHORITY WHEN

THE ELEMENT IS NOT YET SOLD SEPARATELY, BUT IS EXPECTED TO BE SOLD IN THE NEAR FUTURE AT THE PRICE SET BY MANAGEMENT.

SOFTWARE UPDATES

THAT WILL BE PROVIDED FREE OF CHARGE ARE EVALUATED ON A CASE-BY-CASE BASIS TO DETERMINE WHETHER THEY MEET THE DEFINITION OF AN UPGRADE AND CREATE A MULTIPLE-ELEMENT ARRANGEMENT, WHICH MAY REQUIRE REVENUE TO BE DEFERRED AND RECOGNIZED WHEN THE

UPGRADE IS DELIVERED, OR IF IT IS DETERMINED THAT IMPLIED POST-CONTRACT CUSTOMER SUPPORT (PCS) IS BEING PROVIDED, THE ARRANGEMENT IS ACCOUNTED FOR AS A MULTIPLE-ELEMENT ARRANGEMENT AND ALL

58

TABLE OF CONTENTS

PART II

ITEM 8

REVENUE FROM THE ARRANGEMENT IS DEFERRED AND RECOGNIZED OVER THE IMPLIED PCS TERM WHEN THE VSOE OF FAIR VALUE DOES NOT EXIST. IF UPDATES ARE DETERMINED TO NOT MEET THE DEFINITION OF AN UPGRADE,

REVENUE IS GENERALLY RECOGNIZED AS PRODUCTS ARE SHIPPED OR MADE AVAILABLE.

CUSTOMERS PURCHASING A WINDOWS 10 LICENSE WILL RECEIVE

UNSPECIFIED UPDATES AND UPGRADES OVER THE LIFE OF THEIR WINDOWS 10 DEVICE AT NO ADDITIONAL COST. AS THESE UPDATES AND UPGRADES WILL NOT BE SOLD ON A STAND-ALONE BASIS, WE ARE UNABLE TO ESTABLISH VSOE OF FAIR VALUE. ACCORDINGLY, REVENUE FROM LICENSES

OF WINDOWS 10 IS RECOGNIZED RATABLY OVER THE ESTIMATED LIFE OF THE RELATED DEVICE, WHICH RANGES BETWEEN TWO TO FOUR YEARS.

CERTAIN

VOLUME LICENSING ARRANGEMENTS INCLUDE A PERPETUAL LICENSE FOR CURRENT PRODUCTS COMBINED WITH RIGHTS TO RECEIVE UNSPECIFIED FUTURE VERSIONS OF SOFTWARE PRODUCTS, WHICH WE HAVE DETERMINED ARE ADDITIONAL SOFTWARE PRODUCTS AND ARE THEREFORE ACCOUNTED

FOR AS SUBSCRIPTIONS, WITH BILLINGS RECORDED AS UNEARNED REVENUE AND RECOGNIZED AS REVENUE RATABLY OVER THE COVERAGE PERIOD. ARRANGEMENTS THAT INCLUDE TERM-BASED LICENSES FOR CURRENT PRODUCTS WITH THE RIGHT TO USE UNSPECIFIED FUTURE VERSIONS OF THE

SOFTWARE DURING THE COVERAGE PERIOD, ARE ALSO ACCOUNTED FOR AS SUBSCRIPTIONS, WITH REVENUE RECOGNIZED RATABLY OVER THE COVERAGE PERIOD. REVENUE FROM CLOUD-BASED SERVICES ARRANGEMENTS THAT ALLOW FOR THE USE OF A HOSTED SOFTWARE PRODUCT OR SERVICE

OVER A CONTRACTUALLY DETERMINED PERIOD OF TIME WITHOUT TAKING POSSESSION OF SOFTWARE ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AS SUBSCRIPTIONS WITH BILLINGS RECORDED AS UNEARNED REVENUE AND RECOGNIZED AS REVENUE RATABLY OVER THE COVERAGE PERIOD BEGINNING ON THE DATE THE

SERVICE IS MADE AVAILABLE TO CUSTOMERS. REVENUE FROM CLOUD-BASED SERVICES ARRANGEMENTS THAT ARE PROVIDED ON A CONSUMPTION BASIS (FOR EXAMPLE, THE AMOUNT OF STORAGE USED IN A PARTICULAR PERIOD) IS RECOGNIZED COMMENSURATE WITH THE CUSTOMER UTILIZATION

OF SUCH RESOURCES.

SOME VOLUME LICENSING ARRANGEMENTS INCLUDE TIME-BASED SUBSCRIPTIONS FOR CLOUD-BASED SERVICES AND SOFTWARE OFFERINGS

THAT ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AS SUBSCRIPTIONS. THESE ARRANGEMENTS ARE CONSIDERED MULTIPLE-ELEMENT ARRANGEMENTS. HOWEVER, BECAUSE ALL ELEMENTS ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AS SUBSCRIPTIONS AND HAVE THE SAME COVERAGE PERIOD AND DELIVERY PATTERN, THEY HAVE THE SAME

REVENUE RECOGNITION TIMING.

REVENUE RELATED TO MICROSOFT SURFACE (SURFACE) DEVICES, XBOX CONSOLES, GAMES PUBLISHED BY US,

PHONES, AND OTHER HARDWARE COMPONENTS IS GENERALLY RECOGNIZED WHEN OWNERSHIP IS TRANSFERRED TO THE RESELLERS OR TO END CUSTOMERS WHEN SELLING DIRECTLY THROUGH MICROSOFT RETAIL STORES AND ONLINE MARKETPLACES. A PORTION OF REVENUE MAY BE DEFERRED WHEN

THESE PRODUCTS ARE COMBINED WITH SOFTWARE ELEMENTS, AND/OR SERVICES. REVENUE RELATED TO LICENSING FOR GAMES PUBLISHED BY THIRD PARTIES FOR USE ON THE XBOX CONSOLES IS RECOGNIZED WHEN GAMES ARE MANUFACTURED BY THE GAME PUBLISHERS.

DISPLAY ADVERTISING REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED AS ADVERTISEMENTS ARE DISPLAYED. SEARCH ADVERTISING REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED WHEN THE AD APPEARS IN THE

SEARCH RESULTS OR WHEN THE ACTION NECESSARY TO EARN THE REVENUE HAS BEEN COMPLETED. CONSULTING SERVICES REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED AS SERVICES ARE RENDERED, GENERALLY BASED ON THE NEGOTIATED HOURLY RATE IN THE CONSULTING ARRANGEMENT AND THE NUMBER OF

HOURS WORKED DURING THE PERIOD. CONSULTING REVENUE FOR FIXED-PRICE SERVICES ARRANGEMENTS IS RECOGNIZED AS SERVICES ARE PROVIDED.

COST OF REVENUE

COST OF REVENUE INCLUDES: MANUFACTURING AND DISTRIBUTION COSTS FOR PRODUCTS SOLD AND PROGRAMS LICENSED; OPERATING COSTS RELATED TO

PRODUCT SUPPORT SERVICE CENTERS AND PRODUCT DISTRIBUTION CENTERS; COSTS INCURRED TO INCLUDE SOFTWARE ON PCS SOLD BY OEMS, TO DRIVE TRAFFIC TO OUR WEBSITES, AND TO ACQUIRE ONLINE ADVERTISING SPACE; COSTS INCURRED TO SUPPORT AND MAINTAIN

INTERNET-BASED PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, INCLUDING DATACENTER COSTS AND ROYALTIES; WARRANTY COSTS; INVENTORY VALUATION ADJUSTMENTS; COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE DELIVERY OF CONSULTING SERVICES; AND THE AMORTIZATION OF CAPITALIZED SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT

COSTS. CAPITALIZED SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT COSTS ARE AMORTIZED OVER THE ESTIMATED LIVES OF THE PRODUCTS.

PRODUCT WARRANTY

WE PROVIDE FOR THE ESTIMATED COSTS OF FULFILLING OUR OBLIGATIONS UNDER HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE WARRANTIES AT THE TIME THE RELATED REVENUE IS

RECOGNIZED. FOR HARDWARE WARRANTIES, WE ESTIMATE THE COSTS BASED ON HISTORICAL AND PROJECTED

59

TABLE OF CONTENTS

PART II

ITEM 8

PRODUCT FAILURE RATES, HISTORICAL AND PROJECTED REPAIR COSTS, AND KNOWLEDGE OF SPECIFIC PRODUCT FAILURES (IF ANY). THE SPECIFIC HARDWARE WARRANTY TERMS AND CONDITIONS VARY DEPENDING UPON THE

PRODUCT SOLD AND THE COUNTRY IN WHICH WE DO BUSINESS, BUT GENERALLY INCLUDE PARTS AND LABOR OVER A PERIOD GENERALLY RANGING FROM 90 DAYS TO THREE YEARS. FOR SOFTWARE WARRANTIES, WE ESTIMATE THE COSTS TO PROVIDE BUG FIXES, SUCH AS SECURITY

PATCHES, OVER THE ESTIMATED LIFE OF THE SOFTWARE. WE REGULARLY REEVALUATE OUR ESTIMATES TO ASSESS THE ADEQUACY OF THE RECORDED WARRANTY LIABILITIES AND ADJUST THE AMOUNTS AS NECESSARY.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES INCLUDE PAYROLL, EMPLOYEE

BENEFITS, STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE, AND OTHER HEADCOUNT-RELATED EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT. RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES ALSO INCLUDE THIRD-PARTY DEVELOPMENT AND PROGRAMMING COSTS, LOCALIZATION COSTS INCURRED TO

TRANSLATE SOFTWARE FOR INTERNATIONAL MARKETS, AND THE AMORTIZATION OF PURCHASED SOFTWARE CODE AND SERVICES CONTENT. SUCH COSTS RELATED TO SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT ARE INCLUDED IN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSE UNTIL THE POINT THAT TECHNOLOGICAL

FEASIBILITY IS REACHED, WHICH FOR OUR SOFTWARE PRODUCTS, IS GENERALLY SHORTLY BEFORE THE PRODUCTS ARE RELEASED TO MANUFACTURING. ONCE TECHNOLOGICAL FEASIBILITY IS REACHED, SUCH COSTS ARE CAPITALIZED AND AMORTIZED TO COST OF REVENUE OVER THE

ESTIMATED LIVES OF THE PRODUCTS.

SALES AND MARKETING

SALES AND MARKETING EXPENSES INCLUDE PAYROLL, EMPLOYEE BENEFITS, STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE, AND OTHER HEADCOUNT-RELATED EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH SALES AND MARKETING PERSONNEL, AND THE COSTS OF ADVERTISING,

PROMOTIONS, TRADE SHOWS, SEMINARS, AND OTHER PROGRAMS. ADVERTISING COSTS ARE EXPENSED AS INCURRED. ADVERTISING EXPENSE WAS $1.6 BILLION, $1.9 BILLION, AND $2.3 BILLION IN FISCAL YEARS 2016, 2015, AND 2014, RESPECTIVELY.

STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION

COMPENSATION COST

FOR STOCK AWARDS IS MEASURED AT THE FAIR VALUE ON THE GRANT DATE AND RECOGNIZED AS EXPENSE, NET OF ESTIMATED FORFEITURES, OVER THE RELATED SERVICE PERIOD USING THE STRAIGHT-LINE METHOD. THE FAIR VALUE OF STOCK AWARDS IS BASED ON THE QUOTED PRICE OF

OUR COMMON STOCK ON THE GRANT DATE LESS THE PRESENT VALUE OF EXPECTED DIVIDENDS NOT RECEIVED DURING THE VESTING PERIOD. COMPENSATION EXPENSE FOR THE EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN (ESPP) IS MEASURED AS THE DISCOUNT THE EMPLOYEE IS ENTITLED

TO UPON PURCHASE AND IS RECOGNIZED IN THE PERIOD OF PURCHASE.

INCOME TAXES

INCOME TAX EXPENSE INCLUDES U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL INCOME TAXES, THE PROVISION FOR U.S. TAXES ON UNDISTRIBUTED EARNINGS OF INTERNATIONAL

SUBSIDIARIES NOT DEEMED TO BE PERMANENTLY REINVESTED, AND INTEREST AND PENALTIES ON UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS. CERTAIN INCOME AND EXPENSES ARE NOT REPORTED IN TAX RETURNS AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN THE SAME YEAR. THE TAX EFFECT OF SUCH TEMPORARY

DIFFERENCES IS REPORTED AS DEFERRED INCOME TAXES. DEFERRED TAX ASSETS ARE REPORTED NET OF A VALUATION ALLOWANCE WHEN IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT A TAX BENEFIT WILL NOT BE REALIZED. ALL DEFERRED INCOME TAXES ARE CLASSIFIED AS LONG-TERM ON OUR

CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS.

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

WE ACCOUNT FOR CERTAIN ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AT FAIR VALUE. THE HIERARCHY BELOW LISTS THREE LEVELS OF FAIR VALUE BASED ON THE EXTENT TO WHICH INPUTS USED IN MEASURING FAIR VALUE ARE OBSERVABLE IN THE

MARKET. WE CATEGORIZE EACH OF OUR FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS IN ONE OF THESE THREE LEVELS BASED ON THE LOWEST LEVEL INPUT THAT IS SIGNIFICANT TO THE FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT IN ITS ENTIRETY. THESE LEVELS ARE.



LEVEL 1

 INPUTS ARE BASED UPON UNADJUSTED QUOTED PRICES FOR IDENTICAL INSTRUMENTS TRADED IN ACTIVE MARKETS. OUR LEVEL 1 NON-DERIVATIVE

INVESTMENTS PRIMARILY INCLUDE U.S. GOVERNMENT SECURITIES, DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL EQUITIES, AND ACTIVELY TRADED MUTUAL FUNDS. OUR LEVEL 1 DERIVATIVE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES INCLUDE THOSE ACTIVELY TRADED ON EXCHANGES.

60

TABLE OF CONTENTS

PART II

ITEM 8



LEVEL 2

 INPUTS ARE BASED UPON QUOTED PRICES FOR SIMILAR INSTRUMENTS IN ACTIVE MARKETS, QUOTED PRICES FOR IDENTICAL OR SIMILAR INSTRUMENTS IN

MARKETS THAT ARE NOT ACTIVE, AND MODEL-BASED VALUATION TECHNIQUES (E.G. THE BLACK-SCHOLES MODEL) FOR WHICH ALL SIGNIFICANT INPUTS ARE OBSERVABLE IN THE MARKET OR CAN BE CORROBORATED BY OBSERVABLE MARKET DATA FOR SUBSTANTIALLY THE FULL TERM OF THE

ASSETS OR LIABILITIES. WHERE APPLICABLE, THESE MODELS PROJECT FUTURE CASH FLOWS AND DISCOUNT THE FUTURE AMOUNTS TO A PRESENT VALUE USING MARKET-BASED OBSERVABLE INPUTS INCLUDING INTEREST RATE CURVES, CREDIT SPREADS, FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES, AND

FORWARD AND SPOT PRICES FOR CURRENCIES AND COMMODITIES. OUR LEVEL 2 NON-DERIVATIVE INVESTMENTS CONSIST PRIMARILY OF CORPORATE NOTES AND BONDS, COMMON AND PREFERRED STOCK, MORTGAGE- AND ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES, U.S. GOVERNMENT AND AGENCY SECURITIES,

AND FOREIGN GOVERNMENT BONDS. OUR LEVEL 2 DERIVATIVE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES PRIMARILY INCLUDE CERTAIN OVER-THE-COUNTER OPTION AND SWAP CONTRACTS.



LEVEL 3

 INPUTS ARE GENERALLY UNOBSERVABLE AND TYPICALLY REFLECT MANAGEMENTS ESTIMATES OF ASSUMPTIONS THAT MARKET PARTICIPANTS WOULD USE IN

PRICING THE ASSET OR LIABILITY. THE FAIR VALUES ARE THEREFORE DETERMINED USING MODEL-BASED TECHNIQUES, INCLUDING OPTION PRICING MODELS AND DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW MODELS. OUR LEVEL 3 NON-DERIVATIVE ASSETS PRIMARILY COMPRISE INVESTMENTS IN COMMON AND

PREFERRED STOCK, AND GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS, WHEN THEY ARE RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE DUE TO AN IMPAIRMENT CHARGE. UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS USED IN THE MODELS ARE SIGNIFICANT TO THE FAIR VALUES OF THE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES.

WE MEASURE CERTAIN ASSETS, INCLUDING OUR COST AND EQUITY METHOD INVESTMENTS, AT FAIR VALUE ON A NONRECURRING BASIS

WHEN THEY ARE DEEMED TO BE OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARILY IMPAIRED. THE FAIR VALUES OF THESE INVESTMENTS ARE DETERMINED BASED ON VALUATION TECHNIQUES USING THE BEST INFORMATION AVAILABLE, AND MAY INCLUDE QUOTED MARKET PRICES, MARKET COMPARABLES, AND

DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW PROJECTIONS. AN IMPAIRMENT CHARGE IS RECORDED WHEN THE COST OF THE INVESTMENT EXCEEDS ITS FAIR VALUE AND THIS CONDITION IS DETERMINED TO BE OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY.

OUR OTHER CURRENT FINANCIAL ASSETS AND OUR CURRENT FINANCIAL LIABILITIES HAVE FAIR VALUES THAT APPROXIMATE THEIR CARRYING VALUES.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

INVESTMENTS

WE CONSIDER ALL HIGHLY LIQUID INTEREST-EARNING INVESTMENTS WITH A MATURITY OF THREE MONTHS OR LESS AT THE DATE OF PURCHASE TO BE CASH EQUIVALENTS.

THE FAIR VALUES OF THESE INVESTMENTS APPROXIMATE THEIR CARRYING VALUES. IN GENERAL, INVESTMENTS WITH ORIGINAL MATURITIES OF GREATER THAN THREE MONTHS AND REMAINING MATURITIES OF LESS THAN ONE YEAR ARE CLASSIFIED AS SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS.

INVESTMENTS WITH MATURITIES BEYOND ONE YEAR MAY BE CLASSIFIED AS SHORT-TERM BASED ON THEIR HIGHLY LIQUID NATURE AND BECAUSE SUCH MARKETABLE SECURITIES REPRESENT THE INVESTMENT OF CASH THAT IS AVAILABLE FOR CURRENT OPERATIONS. ALL CASH EQUIVALENTS

AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS ARE CLASSIFIED AS AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE AND REALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES ARE RECORDED USING THE SPECIFIC IDENTIFICATION METHOD. CHANGES IN MARKET VALUE, EXCLUDING OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENTS, ARE REFLECTED IN OCI.

EQUITY AND OTHER INVESTMENTS CLASSIFIED AS LONG-TERM INCLUDE BOTH DEBT AND EQUITY INSTRUMENTS. DEBT AND PUBLICLY-TRADED EQUITY

SECURITIES ARE CLASSIFIED AS AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE AND REALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES ARE RECORDED USING THE SPECIFIC IDENTIFICATION METHOD. CHANGES IN THE MARKET VALUE OF AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE SECURITIES, EXCLUDING OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENTS, ARE

REFLECTED IN OCI. COMMON AND PREFERRED STOCK AND OTHER INVESTMENTS THAT ARE RESTRICTED FOR MORE THAN ONE YEAR OR ARE NOT PUBLICLY TRADED ARE RECORDED AT COST OR USING THE EQUITY METHOD.

WE LEND CERTAIN FIXED-INCOME AND EQUITY SECURITIES TO INCREASE INVESTMENT RETURNS. THESE TRANSACTIONS ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AS SECURED BORROWINGS AND

THE LOANED SECURITIES CONTINUE TO BE CARRIED AS INVESTMENTS ON OUR CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS. CASH AND/OR SECURITY INTERESTS ARE RECEIVED AS COLLATERAL FOR THE LOANED SECURITIES WITH THE AMOUNT DETERMINED BASED UPON THE UNDERLYING SECURITY LENT

AND THE CREDITWORTHINESS OF THE BORROWER. CASH RECEIVED IS RECORDED AS AN ASSET WITH A CORRESPONDING LIABILITY.

INVESTMENTS ARE

CONSIDERED TO BE IMPAIRED WHEN A DECLINE IN FAIR VALUE IS JUDGED TO BE OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY. FAIR VALUE IS CALCULATED BASED ON PUBLICLY AVAILABLE MARKET INFORMATION OR OTHER ESTIMATES DETERMINED BY MANAGEMENT. WE EMPLOY A SYSTEMATIC METHODOLOGY ON A

QUARTERLY BASIS THAT CONSIDERS AVAILABLE QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE

61

TABLE OF CONTENTS

PART II

ITEM 8

EVIDENCE IN EVALUATING POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT OF OUR INVESTMENTS. IF THE COST OF AN INVESTMENT EXCEEDS ITS FAIR VALUE, WE EVALUATE, AMONG OTHER FACTORS, GENERAL MARKET CONDITIONS, CREDIT QUALITY OF

DEBT INSTRUMENT ISSUERS, THE DURATION AND EXTENT TO WHICH THE FAIR VALUE IS LESS THAN COST, AND FOR EQUITY SECURITIES, OUR INTENT AND ABILITY TO HOLD, OR PLANS TO SELL, THE INVESTMENT. FOR FIXED-INCOME SECURITIES, WE ALSO EVALUATE WHETHER WE HAVE

PLANS TO SELL THE SECURITY OR IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT WE WILL BE REQUIRED TO SELL THE SECURITY BEFORE RECOVERY. WE ALSO CONSIDER SPECIFIC ADVERSE CONDITIONS RELATED TO THE FINANCIAL HEALTH OF AND BUSINESS OUTLOOK FOR THE INVESTEE, INCLUDING

INDUSTRY AND SECTOR PERFORMANCE, CHANGES IN TECHNOLOGY, AND OPERATIONAL AND FINANCING CASH FLOW FACTORS. ONCE A DECLINE IN FAIR VALUE IS DETERMINED TO BE OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY, AN IMPAIRMENT CHARGE IS RECORDED TO OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE), NET AND A NEW

COST BASIS IN THE INVESTMENT IS ESTABLISHED.

DERIVATIVES

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS ARE RECOGNIZED AS EITHER ASSETS OR LIABILITIES AND ARE MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE. THE ACCOUNTING FOR CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF A DERIVATIVE DEPENDS ON THE INTENDED USE OF THE DERIVATIVE AND

THE RESULTING DESIGNATION.

FOR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS DESIGNATED AS FAIR VALUE HEDGES, THE GAINS (LOSSES) ARE RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS IN

THE PERIODS OF CHANGE TOGETHER WITH THE OFFSETTING LOSSES (GAINS) ON THE HEDGED ITEMS ATTRIBUTED TO THE RISK BEING HEDGED. FOR OPTIONS DESIGNATED AS FAIR VALUE HEDGES, CHANGES IN THE TIME VALUE ARE EXCLUDED FROM THE ASSESSMENT OF HEDGE EFFECTIVENESS

AND ARE RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS.

FOR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS DESIGNATED AS CASH FLOW HEDGES, THE EFFECTIVE PORTION OF THE GAINS (LOSSES)

ON THE DERIVATIVES IS INITIALLY REPORTED AS A COMPONENT OF OCI AND IS SUBSEQUENTLY RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS WHEN THE HEDGED EXPOSURE IS RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS. FOR OPTIONS DESIGNATED AS CASH FLOW HEDGES, CHANGES IN THE TIME VALUE ARE EXCLUDED FROM THE

ASSESSMENT OF HEDGE EFFECTIVENESS AND ARE RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS. GAINS (LOSSES) ON DERIVATIVES REPRESENTING EITHER HEDGE COMPONENTS EXCLUDED FROM THE ASSESSMENT OF EFFECTIVENESS OR HEDGE INEFFECTIVENESS ARE RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS.

FOR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS THAT ARE NOT DESIGNATED AS HEDGES, GAINS (LOSSES) FROM CHANGES IN FAIR VALUES ARE PRIMARILY RECOGNIZED IN OTHER INCOME

(EXPENSE), NET. OTHER THAN THOSE DERIVATIVES ENTERED INTO FOR INVESTMENT PURPOSES, SUCH AS COMMODITY CONTRACTS, THE GAINS (LOSSES) ARE GENERALLY ECONOMICALLY OFFSET BY UNREALIZED GAINS (LOSSES) IN THE UNDERLYING AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE SECURITIES, WHICH

ARE RECORDED AS A COMPONENT OF OCI UNTIL THE SECURITIES ARE SOLD OR OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARILY IMPAIRED, AT WHICH TIME THE AMOUNTS ARE RECLASSIFIED FROM ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (AOCI) INTO OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE), NET.

ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS

THE ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS REFLECTS OUR BEST ESTIMATE OF PROBABLE LOSSES INHERENT IN THE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE BALANCE. WE DETERMINE THE

ALLOWANCE BASED ON KNOWN TROUBLED ACCOUNTS, HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE, AND OTHER CURRENTLY AVAILABLE EVIDENCE. ACTIVITY IN THE ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS WAS AS FOLLOWS.

QUANTITIES ON HAND, FUTURE PURCHASE COMMITMENTS WITH OUR SUPPLIERS, AND THE ESTIMATED UTILITY OF OUR INVENTORY. IF OUR REVIEW INDICATES A REDUCTION IN UTILITY BELOW CARRYING VALUE, WE REDUCE OUR

PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT

PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT IS STATED AT COST LESS ACCUMULATED DEPRECIATION, AND DEPRECIATED USING THE STRAIGHT-LINE METHOD OVER THE SHORTER OF THE

ESTIMATED USEFUL LIFE OF THE ASSET OR THE LEASE TERM. THE ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES OF OUR PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT ARE GENERALLY AS FOLLOWS: COMPUTER SOFTWARE DEVELOPED OR ACQUIRED FOR INTERNAL USE, THREE TO SEVEN YEARS; COMPUTER EQUIPMENT, TWO TO THREE

YEARS; BUILDINGS AND IMPROVEMENTS, FIVE TO 15 YEARS; LEASEHOLD IMPROVEMENTS, THREE TO 20 YEARS; AND FURNITURE AND EQUIPMENT, ONE TO 10 YEARS. LAND IS NOT DEPRECIATED.

GOODWILL

GOODWILL IS TESTED FOR IMPAIRMENT AT THE REPORTING UNIT LEVEL (OPERATING SEGMENT OR

ONE LEVEL BELOW AN OPERATING SEGMENT) ON AN ANNUAL BASIS (MAY 1 FOR US) AND BETWEEN ANNUAL TESTS IF AN EVENT OCCURS OR CIRCUMSTANCES CHANGE THAT WOULD MORE LIKELY THAN NOT REDUCE THE FAIR VALUE OF A REPORTING UNIT BELOW ITS CARRYING VALUE.

INTANGIBLE ASSETS

ALL OF OUR

INTANGIBLE ASSETS ARE SUBJECT TO AMORTIZATION AND ARE AMORTIZED USING THE STRAIGHT-LINE METHOD OVER THEIR ESTIMATED PERIOD OF BENEFIT, RANGING FROM ONE TO 15 YEARS. WE EVALUATE THE RECOVERABILITY OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS PERIODICALLY BY TAKING INTO

ACCOUNT EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES THAT MAY WARRANT REVISED ESTIMATES OF USEFUL LIVES OR THAT INDICATE THE ASSET MAY BE IMPAIRED.

RECENT ACCOUNTING

GUIDANCE

RECENTLY ADOPTED ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE

IMPROVEMENTS TO EMPLOYEE SHARE-BASED PAYMENT ACCOUNTING

IN MARCH 2016, THE FINANCIAL

ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD (FASB) ISSUED A NEW STANDARD THAT CHANGES THE ACCOUNTING FOR CERTAIN ASPECTS OF SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS TO EMPLOYEES. THE NEW GUIDANCE REQUIRES EXCESS TAX BENEFITS AND TAX DEFICIENCIES TO BE RECORDED IN THE INCOME

STATEMENT WHEN STOCK AWARDS VEST OR ARE SETTLED. IN ADDITION, CASH FLOWS RELATED TO EXCESS TAX BENEFITS WILL NO LONGER BE SEPARATELY CLASSIFIED AS A FINANCING ACTIVITY APART FROM OTHER INCOME TAX CASH FLOWS. THE STANDARD ALSO ALLOWS US TO REPURCHASE

MORE OF AN EMPLOYEES VESTING SHARES FOR TAX WITHHOLDING PURPOSES WITHOUT TRIGGERING LIABILITY ACCOUNTING, CLARIFIES THAT ALL CASH PAYMENTS MADE TO TAX AUTHORITIES ON AN EMPLOYEES BEHALF FOR WITHHELD SHARES SHOULD BE PRESENTED AS A

FINANCING ACTIVITY ON OUR CASH FLOWS STATEMENT, AND PROVIDES AN ACCOUNTING POLICY ELECTION TO ACCOUNT FOR FORFEITURES AS THEY OCCUR. THE NEW STANDARD IS EFFECTIVE FOR US BEGINNING JULY 1, 2017, WITH EARLY ADOPTION PERMITTED.

WE ELECTED TO EARLY ADOPT THE NEW GUIDANCE IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL YEAR 2016 WHICH REQUIRES US TO REFLECT ANY ADJUSTMENTS AS OF JULY 1,

2015, THE BEGINNING OF THE ANNUAL PERIOD THAT INCLUDES THE INTERIM PERIOD OF ADOPTION. THE PRIMARY IMPACT OF ADOPTION WAS THE RECOGNITION OF EXCESS TAX BENEFITS IN OUR PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES RATHER THAN PAID-IN CAPITAL FOR ALL PERIODS IN FISCAL

YEAR 2016. ADDITIONAL AMENDMENTS TO THE ACCOUNTING FOR INCOME TAXES AND MINIMUM STATUTORY WITHHOLDING TAX REQUIREMENTS HAD NO IMPACT TO RETAINED EARNINGS AS OF JULY 1, 2015, WHERE THE CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF THESE CHANGES ARE REQUIRED TO BE

RECORDED. WE HAVE ELECTED TO CONTINUE TO ESTIMATE FORFEITURES EXPECTED TO OCCUR TO DETERMINE THE AMOUNT OF COMPENSATION COST TO BE RECOGNIZED IN EACH PERIOD.

WE ELECTED TO APPLY THE PRESENTATION REQUIREMENTS FOR CASH FLOWS RELATED TO EXCESS TAX BENEFITS RETROSPECTIVELY TO ALL PERIODS PRESENTED WHICH RESULTED IN AN INCREASE TO BOTH NET CASH FROM OPERATIONS AND NET CASH

USED IN FINANCING OF $588 MILLION AND $271 MILLION FOR THE YEARS ENDED JUNE 30, 2015 AND 2014, RESPECTIVELY. THE PRESENTATION REQUIREMENTS FOR CASH FLOWS RELATED TO EMPLOYEE TAXES PAID FOR WITHHELD SHARES HAD NO IMPACT TO ANY OF THE PERIODS

PRESENTED ON OUR CONSOLIDATED CASH FLOWS STATEMENTS SINCE SUCH CASH FLOWS HAVE HISTORICALLY BEEN PRESENTED AS A FINANCING ACTIVITY.

ADOPTION OF THE NEW STANDARD RESULTED IN THE RECOGNITION OF EXCESS TAX BENEFITS IN OUR PROVISION

FOR INCOME TAXES RATHER THAN PAID-IN CAPITAL OF $402 MILLION FOR THE YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2016.

BALANCE SHEET CLASSIFICATION OF DEFERRED TAXES

IN NOVEMBER 2015, THE FASB ISSUED GUIDANCE THAT REQUIRES COMPANIES TO CLASSIFY ALL DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AS

NONCURRENT ON THE BALANCE SHEET RATHER THAN SEPARATELY DISCLOSING DEFERRED TAXES AS CURRENT AND NONCURRENT. THIS STANDARD IS EFFECTIVE FOR US BEGINNING JULY 1, 2017, AND CAN BE EARLY ADOPTED AND APPLIED EITHER PROSPECTIVELY OR RETROSPECTIVELY

TO ALL PERIODS PRESENTED UPON ADOPTION.

WE ELECTED TO EARLY ADOPT THE NEW GUIDANCE IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF FISCAL YEAR 2016 ON A

RETROSPECTIVE BASIS. WHILE THE GUIDANCE CHANGES THE MANNER IN WHICH DEFERRED TAXES ARE CLASSIFIED ON THE BALANCE SHEET, WE ARE STILL REQUIRED TO OFFSET DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES FOR EACH TAXPAYING COMPONENT WITHIN A TAX JURISDICTION.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS  CREDIT LOSSES

IN JUNE 2016, THE FASB ISSUED A NEW STANDARD TO

REPLACE THE INCURRED LOSS IMPAIRMENT METHODOLOGY IN CURRENT GAAP WITH A METHODOLOGY THAT REFLECTS EXPECTED CREDIT LOSSES AND REQUIRES CONSIDERATION OF A BROADER RANGE OF REASONABLE AND SUPPORTABLE INFORMATION TO INFORM CREDIT LOSS ESTIMATES. FOR

TRADE AND OTHER RECEIVABLES, LOANS, AND OTHER FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, WE WILL BE REQUIRED TO USE A FORWARD-LOOKING EXPECTED LOSS MODEL RATHER THAN THE INCURRED LOSS MODEL FOR RECOGNIZING CREDIT LOSSES WHICH REFLECTS LOSSES THAT ARE PROBABLE. CREDIT

LOSSES RELATING TO AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE DEBT SECURITIES WILL ALSO BE RECORDED THROUGH AN ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES RATHER THAN AS A REDUCTION IN THE AMORTIZED COST BASIS OF THE SECURITIES. THE NEW STANDARD WILL BE EFFECTIVE FOR US BEGINNING

JULY 1, 2020, WITH EARLY ADOPTION PERMITTED BEGINNING JULY 1, 2019. APPLICATION OF THE AMENDMENTS IS THROUGH A CUMULATIVE-EFFECT ADJUSTMENT TO RETAINED EARNINGS AS OF THE EFFECTIVE DATE. WE ARE CURRENTLY EVALUATING THE IMPACT OF THIS

STANDARD ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

LEASES

IN FEBRUARY 2016, THE FASB ISSUED A NEW STANDARD RELATED TO LEASES TO INCREASE TRANSPARENCY AND COMPARABILITY AMONG ORGANIZATIONS BY REQUIRING THE RECOGNITION OF LEASE ASSETS AND LEASE LIABILITIES ON THE BALANCE

SHEET. MOST PROMINENT AMONG THE AMENDMENTS IS THE RECOGNITION OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES BY LESSEES FOR THOSE LEASES CLASSIFIED AS OPERATING LEASES UNDER PREVIOUS U.S. GAAP. UNDER THE NEW STANDARD, DISCLOSURES ARE REQUIRED TO MEET THE OBJECTIVE OF

ENABLING USERS OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS TO ASSESS THE AMOUNT, TIMING, AND UNCERTAINTY OF CASH FLOWS ARISING FROM LEASES. WE WILL BE REQUIRED TO RECOGNIZE AND MEASURE LEASES AT THE BEGINNING OF THE EARLIEST PERIOD PRESENTED USING A MODIFIED

RETROSPECTIVE APPROACH.

THE NEW STANDARD WILL BE EFFECTIVE FOR US BEGINNING JULY 1, 2019, WITH EARLY ADOPTION PERMITTED. WE

CURRENTLY ANTICIPATE EARLY ADOPTION OF THE NEW STANDARD EFFECTIVE JULY 1, 2017 IN CONJUNCTION WITH OUR ADOPTION OF THE NEW REVENUE STANDARD. OUR ABILITY TO EARLY ADOPT IS DEPENDENT ON SYSTEM READINESS, INCLUDING SOFTWARE PROCURED FROM

THIRD-PARTY PROVIDERS, AND THE COMPLETION OF OUR ANALYSIS OF INFORMATION NECESSARY TO RESTATE PRIOR PERIOD FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

WE ANTICIPATE THIS STANDARD WILL HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

WHILE WE ARE CONTINUING TO ASSESS ALL POTENTIAL IMPACTS OF THE STANDARD, WE CURRENTLY BELIEVE THE MOST SIGNIFICANT IMPACT RELATES TO OUR ACCOUNTING FOR OFFICE, RETAIL, AND DATACENTER OPERATING LEASES.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS  RECOGNITION, MEASUREMENT, PRESENTATION, AND DISCLOSURE

IN JANUARY 2016, THE FASB ISSUED A NEW STANDARD TO AMEND CERTAIN ASPECTS OF RECOGNITION, MEASUREMENT, PRESENTATION, AND DISCLOSURE OF FINANCIAL

INSTRUMENTS. MOST PROMINENT AMONG THE AMENDMENTS IS THE REQUIREMENT FOR CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR EQUITY INVESTMENTS, WITH CERTAIN EXCEPTIONS, TO BE RECOGNIZED THROUGH NET INCOME RATHER THAN OCI. THE NEW STANDARD WILL BE EFFECTIVE FOR US

BEGINNING JULY 1, 2018. THE APPLICATION OF THE AMENDMENTS WILL RESULT IN A CUMULATIVE-EFFECT ADJUSTMENT TO OUR CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS AS OF THE EFFECTIVE DATE. WE ARE CURRENTLY EVALUATING THE IMPACT OF THIS STANDARD ON OUR CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

REVENUE FROM CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS

IN MAY 2014, THE FASB ISSUED A NEW STANDARD RELATED TO REVENUE RECOGNITION. UNDER THE NEW STANDARD, REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED WHEN A CUSTOMER OBTAINS CONTROL OF PROMISED GOODS OR SERVICES AND IS RECOGNIZED IN AN AMOUNT

THAT REFLECTS THE CONSIDERATION WHICH THE ENTITY EXPECTS TO RECEIVE IN EXCHANGE FOR THOSE GOODS OR SERVICES. IN ADDITION, THE STANDARD REQUIRES DISCLOSURE OF THE NATURE, AMOUNT, TIMING, AND UNCERTAINTY OF REVENUE AND CASH FLOWS ARISING FROM

CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS. THE FASB HAS RECENTLY ISSUED SEVERAL AMENDMENTS TO THE STANDARD, INCLUDING CLARIFICATION ON ACCOUNTING FOR LICENSES OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND IDENTIFYING PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS.

THE GUIDANCE PERMITS TWO METHODS OF ADOPTION: RETROSPECTIVELY TO EACH PRIOR REPORTING PERIOD PRESENTED (FULL RETROSPECTIVE METHOD), OR

RETROSPECTIVELY WITH THE CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF INITIALLY APPLYING THE GUIDANCE RECOGNIZED AT THE DATE OF INITIAL APPLICATION (THE CUMULATIVE CATCH-UP TRANSITION METHOD). WE CURRENTLY ANTICIPATE ADOPTING THE STANDARD USING THE FULL RETROSPECTIVE

METHOD TO RESTATE EACH PRIOR REPORTING PERIOD PRESENTED.

THE NEW STANDARD WILL BE EFFECTIVE FOR US BEGINNING JULY 1, 2018, AND

ADOPTION AS OF THE ORIGINAL EFFECTIVE DATE OF JULY 1, 2017 IS PERMITTED. WE CURRENTLY ANTICIPATE EARLY ADOPTION OF THE NEW STANDARD EFFECTIVE JULY 1, 2017. OUR ABILITY TO EARLY ADOPT USING THE FULL RETROSPECTIVE METHOD IS DEPENDENT ON

SYSTEM READINESS, INCLUDING SOFTWARE PROCURED FROM THIRD-PARTY PROVIDERS, AND THE COMPLETION OF OUR ANALYSIS OF INFORMATION NECESSARY TO RESTATE PRIOR PERIOD FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

WE ANTICIPATE THIS STANDARD WILL HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. WHILE WE ARE CONTINUING TO ASSESS ALL POTENTIAL

IMPACTS OF THE STANDARD, WE CURRENTLY BELIEVE THE MOST SIGNIFICANT IMPACT RELATES TO OUR ACCOUNTING FOR SOFTWARE LICENSE REVENUE. WE EXPECT REVENUE RELATED TO HARDWARE, CLOUD OFFERINGS, AND PROFESSIONAL SERVICES TO REMAIN SUBSTANTIALLY UNCHANGED.

SPECIFICALLY, UNDER THE NEW STANDARD WE EXPECT TO RECOGNIZE WINDOWS 10 REVENUE PREDOMINANTLY AT THE TIME OF BILLING RATHER THAN RATABLY OVER THE LIFE OF THE RELATED DEVICE. WE ALSO EXPECT TO RECOGNIZE LICENSE REVENUE AT THE TIME OF BILLING RATHER

THAN OVER THE SUBSCRIPTION PERIOD FROM CERTAIN MULTI-YEAR COMMERCIAL SOFTWARE SUBSCRIPTIONS THAT INCLUDE BOTH SOFTWARE LICENSES AND SOFTWARE ASSURANCE. DUE TO THE COMPLEXITY OF CERTAIN OF OUR COMMERCIAL LICENSE SUBSCRIPTION CONTRACTS, THE ACTUAL

REVENUE RECOGNITION TREATMENT REQUIRED UNDER THE STANDARD WILL BE DEPENDENT ON CONTRACT-SPECIFIC TERMS, AND MAY VARY IN SOME INSTANCES FROM RECOGNITION AT THE TIME OF BILLING.

WE CURRENTLY BELIEVE THAT THE NET CHANGE IN WINDOWS 10 REVENUE FROM PERIOD TO PERIOD IS INDICATIVE OF THE NET CHANGE IN REVENUE WE EXPECT FROM THE ADOPTION OF THE NEW STANDARD.

NOTE 2  EARNINGS PER SHARE

BASIC EARNINGS PER SHARE (EPS) IS COMPUTED BASED ON THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE NUMBER OF SHARES OF COMMON STOCK OUTSTANDING DURING THE PERIOD. DILUTED EPS IS COMPUTED BASED ON THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE NUMBER OF

SHARES OF COMMON STOCK PLUS THE EFFECT OF DILUTIVE POTENTIAL COMMON SHARES OUTSTANDING DURING THE PERIOD USING THE TREASURY STOCK METHOD. DILUTIVE POTENTIAL COMMON SHARES INCLUDE OUTSTANDING STOCK OPTIONS AND STOCK AWARDS.

NOTE 5  DERIVATIVES

WE USE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS TO MANAGE RISKS RELATED TO FOREIGN CURRENCIES, EQUITY PRICES, INTEREST RATES, AND CREDIT; TO ENHANCE INVESTMENT RETURNS; AND TO FACILITATE PORTFOLIO DIVERSIFICATION. OUR OBJECTIVES FOR

HOLDING DERIVATIVES INCLUDE REDUCING, ELIMINATING, AND EFFICIENTLY MANAGING THE ECONOMIC IMPACT OF THESE EXPOSURES AS EFFECTIVELY AS POSSIBLE.

OUR DERIVATIVE PROGRAMS INCLUDE STRATEGIES THAT BOTH QUALIFY AND DO NOT QUALIFY FOR HEDGE ACCOUNTING TREATMENT. ALL NOTIONAL AMOUNTS PRESENTED BELOW ARE MEASURED IN U.S. DOLLAR EQUIVALENTS.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

PART II

ITEM 8

FOREIGN CURRENCY

CERTAIN FORECASTED TRANSACTIONS, ASSETS, AND LIABILITIES ARE EXPOSED TO FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK. WE MONITOR OUR FOREIGN CURRENCY EXPOSURES DAILY TO MAXIMIZE THE ECONOMIC EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR FOREIGN CURRENCY HEDGE

POSITIONS. OPTION AND FORWARD CONTRACTS ARE USED TO HEDGE A PORTION OF FORECASTED INTERNATIONAL REVENUE FOR UP TO THREE YEARS IN THE FUTURE AND ARE DESIGNATED AS CASH FLOW HEDGING INSTRUMENTS. PRINCIPAL CURRENCIES HEDGED INCLUDE THE EURO, JAPANESE

YEN, BRITISH POUND, CANADIAN DOLLAR, AND AUSTRALIAN DOLLAR. AS OF JUNE 30, 2016 AND JUNE 30, 2015, THE TOTAL NOTIONAL AMOUNTS OF THESE FOREIGN EXCHANGE CONTRACTS SOLD WERE $8.4 BILLION AND $9.8 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY.

FOREIGN CURRENCY RISKS RELATED TO CERTAIN NON-U.S. DOLLAR DENOMINATED SECURITIES ARE HEDGED USING FOREIGN EXCHANGE FORWARD CONTRACTS THAT ARE

DESIGNATED AS FAIR VALUE HEDGING INSTRUMENTS. AS OF JUNE 30, 2016 AND JUNE 30, 2015, THE TOTAL NOTIONAL AMOUNTS OF THESE FOREIGN EXCHANGE CONTRACTS SOLD WERE $5.3 BILLION FOR BOTH PERIODS.

CERTAIN OPTIONS AND FORWARDS NOT DESIGNATED AS HEDGING INSTRUMENTS ARE ALSO USED TO MANAGE THE VARIABILITY IN FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES ON CERTAIN

BALANCE SHEET AMOUNTS AND TO MANAGE OTHER FOREIGN CURRENCY EXPOSURES. AS OF JUNE 30, 2016, THE TOTAL NOTIONAL AMOUNTS OF THESE FOREIGN EXCHANGE CONTRACTS PURCHASED AND SOLD WERE $12.0 BILLION AND $11.7 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY. AS OF

JUNE 30, 2015, THE TOTAL NOTIONAL AMOUNTS OF THESE FOREIGN EXCHANGE CONTRACTS PURCHASED AND SOLD WERE $9.7 BILLION AND $11.0 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY.

EQUITY

SECURITIES HELD IN OUR EQUITY AND

OTHER INVESTMENTS PORTFOLIO ARE SUBJECT TO MARKET PRICE RISK. MARKET PRICE RISK IS MANAGED RELATIVE TO BROAD-BASED GLOBAL AND DOMESTIC EQUITY INDICES USING CERTAIN CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED INVESTMENTS, OPTIONS, FUTURES, AND SWAP CONTRACTS NOT

DESIGNATED AS HEDGING INSTRUMENTS. FROM TIME TO TIME, TO HEDGE OUR PRICE RISK, WE MAY USE AND DESIGNATE EQUITY DERIVATIVES AS HEDGING INSTRUMENTS, INCLUDING PUTS, CALLS, SWAPS, AND FORWARDS. AS OF JUNE 30, 2016, THE TOTAL NOTIONAL AMOUNTS

OF EQUITY CONTRACTS PURCHASED AND SOLD FOR MANAGING MARKET PRICE RISK WERE $1.3 BILLION AND $2.2 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY, OF WHICH $737 MILLION AND $986 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, WERE DESIGNATED AS HEDGING INSTRUMENTS. AS OF JUNE 30, 2015, THE TOTAL

NOTIONAL AMOUNTS OF EQUITY CONTRACTS PURCHASED AND SOLD FOR MANAGING MARKET PRICE RISK WERE $2.2 BILLION AND $2.6 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY, OF WHICH $1.1 BILLION AND $1.4 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY, WERE DESIGNATED AS HEDGING INSTRUMENTS.

INTEREST RATE

SECURITIES HELD IN OUR

FIXED-INCOME PORTFOLIO ARE SUBJECT TO DIFFERENT INTEREST RATE RISKS BASED ON THEIR MATURITIES. WE MANAGE THE AVERAGE MATURITY OF OUR FIXED-INCOME PORTFOLIO TO ACHIEVE ECONOMIC RETURNS THAT CORRELATE TO CERTAIN BROAD-BASED FIXED-INCOME INDICES USING

EXCHANGE-TRADED OPTION AND FUTURES CONTRACTS, AND OVER-THE-COUNTER SWAP AND OPTION CONTRACTS, NONE OF WHICH ARE DESIGNATED AS HEDGING INSTRUMENTS. AS OF JUNE 30, 2016, THE TOTAL NOTIONAL AMOUNTS OF FIXED-INTEREST RATE CONTRACTS PURCHASED AND

SOLD WERE $328 MILLION AND $2.4 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY. AS OF JUNE 30, 2015, THE TOTAL NOTIONAL AMOUNTS OF FIXED-INTEREST RATE CONTRACTS PURCHASED AND SOLD WERE $1.0 BILLION AND $3.2 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY.

IN ADDITION, WE USE TO BE ANNOUNCED FORWARD PURCHASE COMMITMENTS OF MORTGAGE-BACKED ASSETS TO GAIN EXPOSURE TO AGENCY MORTGAGE-BACKED

SECURITIES. THESE MEET THE DEFINITION OF A DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENT IN CASES WHERE PHYSICAL DELIVERY OF THE ASSETS IS NOT TAKEN AT THE EARLIEST AVAILABLE DELIVERY DATE. AS OF JUNE 30, 2016 AND 2015, THE TOTAL NOTIONAL DERIVATIVE AMOUNTS OF

MORTGAGE CONTRACTS PURCHASED WERE $548 MILLION AND $812 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY.

CREDIT

OUR FIXED-INCOME PORTFOLIO IS DIVERSIFIED AND CONSISTS PRIMARILY OF INVESTMENT-GRADE SECURITIES. WE USE CREDIT DEFAULT SWAP CONTRACTS, NOT

DESIGNATED AS HEDGING INSTRUMENTS, TO MANAGE CREDIT EXPOSURES RELATIVE TO BROAD-BASED INDICES AND TO FACILITATE PORTFOLIO DIVERSIFICATION. WE USE CREDIT DEFAULT SWAPS AS THEY ARE A LOW-COST METHOD OF MANAGING EXPOSURE TO INDIVIDUAL CREDIT RISKS OR

GROUPS OF CREDIT RISKS. AS OF JUNE 30, 2016, THE TOTAL NOTIONAL AMOUNTS OF CREDIT CONTRACTS PURCHASED AND SOLD WERE $440 MILLION AND $273 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. AS OF JUNE 30, 2015, THE TOTAL NOTIONAL AMOUNTS OF CREDIT CONTRACTS PURCHASED

AND SOLD WERE $618 MILLION AND $430 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

PART II

ITEM 8

COMMODITY

WE USE BROAD-BASED COMMODITY EXPOSURES TO ENHANCE PORTFOLIO RETURNS AND TO FACILITATE PORTFOLIO DIVERSIFICATION. WE USE SWAPS, FUTURES, AND OPTION CONTRACTS, NOT DESIGNATED AS HEDGING INSTRUMENTS, TO GENERATE AND

MANAGE EXPOSURES TO BROAD-BASED COMMODITY INDICES. WE USE DERIVATIVES ON COMMODITIES AS THEY CAN BE LOW-COST ALTERNATIVES TO THE PURCHASE AND STORAGE OF A VARIETY OF COMMODITIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, PRECIOUS METALS, ENERGY, AND GRAIN. AS

OF JUNE 30, 2016, THE TOTAL NOTIONAL AMOUNTS OF COMMODITY CONTRACTS PURCHASED AND SOLD WERE $631 MILLION AND $162 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. AS OF JUNE 30, 2015, THE TOTAL NOTIONAL AMOUNTS OF COMMODITY CONTRACTS PURCHASED AND SOLD WERE $882

MILLION AND $316 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY.

CREDIT-RISK-RELATED CONTINGENT FEATURES

CERTAIN OF OUR COUNTERPARTY AGREEMENTS FOR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS CONTAIN PROVISIONS THAT REQUIRE OUR ISSUED AND OUTSTANDING LONG-TERM UNSECURED

DEBT TO MAINTAIN AN INVESTMENT GRADE CREDIT RATING AND REQUIRE US TO MAINTAIN MINIMUM LIQUIDITY OF $1.0 BILLION. TO THE EXTENT WE FAIL TO MEET THESE REQUIREMENTS, WE WILL BE REQUIRED TO POST COLLATERAL, SIMILAR TO THE STANDARD CONVENTION RELATED TO

OVER-THE-COUNTER DERIVATIVES. AS OF JUNE 30, 2016, OUR LONG-TERM UNSECURED DEBT RATING WAS AAA, AND CASH INVESTMENTS WERE IN EXCESS OF $1.0 BILLION. AS A RESULT, NO COLLATERAL WAS REQUIRED TO BE POSTED.

MOJANG SYNERGIES AB

ON

NOVEMBER 6, 2014, WE ACQUIRED MOJANG SYNERGIES AB (MOJANG), THE SWEDISH VIDEO GAME DEVELOPER OF THE MINECRAFT GAMING FRANCHISE, FOR $2.5 BILLION IN CASH, NET OF CASH ACQUIRED. THE ADDITION OF MINECRAFT AND ITS COMMUNITY ENHANCES OUR

GAMING PORTFOLIO ACROSS WINDOWS, XBOX, AND OTHER ECOSYSTEMS BESIDES OUR OWN. THE SIGNIFICANT CLASSES OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES TO WHICH WE ALLOCATED THE PURCHASE PRICE WERE GOODWILL OF $1.8 BILLION AND IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS OF $928 MILLION,

PRIMARILY MARKETING-RELATED (TRADE NAMES). THE GOODWILL RECOGNIZED IN CONNECTION WITH THE ACQUISITION IS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO ANTICIPATED SYNERGIES FROM FUTURE GROWTH, AND IS NOT EXPECTED TO BE DEDUCTIBLE FOR TAX PURPOSES. WE ASSIGNED THE

GOODWILL TO MORE PERSONAL COMPUTING UNDER OUR CURRENT SEGMENT STRUCTURE. IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS WERE ASSIGNED A TOTAL WEIGHTED-AVERAGE AMORTIZATION PERIOD OF 6.3 YEARS. MOJANG HAS BEEN INCLUDED IN OUR CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS SINCE

THE ACQUISITION DATE.

NOKIAS DEVICES AND SERVICES BUSINESS

ON APRIL 25, 2014, WE ACQUIRED SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF NOKIA CORPORATIONS (NOKIA) DEVICES AND SERVICES BUSINESS (NDS) FOR A TOTAL PURCHASE PRICE OF $9.4 BILLION, INCLUDING CASH

ACQUIRED OF $1.5 BILLION (THE ACQUISITION). THE PURCHASE PRICE CONSISTED PRIMARILY OF CASH OF $7.1 BILLION AND NOKIAS REPURCHASE OF CONVERTIBLE NOTES OF $2.1 BILLION, WHICH WAS A NON-CASH TRANSACTION, AND LIABILITIES ASSUMED OF

$0.2 BILLION. THE ACQUISITION WAS EXPECTED TO ACCELERATE THE GROWTH OF OUR DEVICES BUSINESS THROUGH FASTER INNOVATION, SYNERGIES, AND UNIFIED BRANDING AND MARKETING.

THE ALLOCATION OF THE PURCHASE PRICE TO GOODWILL WAS COMPLETED AS OF MARCH 31, 2015. THE MAJOR CLASSES OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES TO WHICH WE ALLOCATED THE PURCHASE PRICE WERE AS FOLLOWS.

DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF FISCAL YEAR 2016, WE RECORDED $630 MILLION OF INTANGIBLE AND FIXED

ASSET IMPAIRMENT CHARGES, AND DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF FISCAL YEAR 2015, WE RECORDED $7.5 BILLION OF GOODWILL AND ASSET IMPAIRMENT CHARGES. THE IMPAIRMENT CHARGES FOR BOTH PERIODS RELATED TO OUR PHONE BUSINESS. THESE COSTS ARE INCLUDED IN

IMPAIRMENT, INTEGRATION, AND RESTRUCTURING EXPENSES ON OUR CONSOLIDATED INCOME STATEMENT. SEE NOTE 10  GOODWILL AND NOTE 11  INTANGIBLE ASSETS FOR ADDITIONAL DETAILS.

IN MAY 2016, WE ANNOUNCED AN AGREEMENT TO SELL OUR ENTRY-LEVEL FEATURE PHONE ASSETS FOR $350 MILLION. THE TRANSACTION IS EXPECTED TO CLOSE IN THE

SECOND HALF OF CALENDAR YEAR 2016, SUBJECT TO REGULATORY APPROVALS AND OTHER CLOSING CONDITIONS.

OUR CONSOLIDATED INCOME STATEMENT FOR

FISCAL YEAR 2014 INCLUDED REVENUE AND OPERATING LOSS OF $2.0 BILLION AND $692 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, ATTRIBUTABLE TO NDS SINCE THE ACQUISITION.

FOLLOWING ARE THE SUPPLEMENTAL CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF MICROSOFT CORPORATION ON AN UNAUDITED PRO FORMA BASIS, AS IF THE ACQUISITION HAD BEEN CONSUMMATED ON JULY 1, 2012.

THESE PRO FORMA RESULTS WERE BASED ON ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS, WHICH WE BELIEVE ARE REASONABLE. THEY ARE NOT THE

RESULTS THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN REALIZED HAD WE BEEN A COMBINED COMPANY DURING THE PERIODS PRESENTED AND ARE NOT NECESSARILY INDICATIVE OF OUR CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN FUTURE PERIODS. THE PRO FORMA RESULTS INCLUDE ADJUSTMENTS PRIMARILY

RELATED TO PURCHASE ACCOUNTING ADJUSTMENTS AND THE ELIMINATION OF RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS BETWEEN MICROSOFT AND NDS. ACQUISITION COSTS AND OTHER NONRECURRING CHARGES INCURRED ARE INCLUDED IN THE EARLIEST PERIOD PRESENTED.

DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF FISCAL YEAR 2014, WE INCURRED $21 MILLION OF ACQUISITION COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE PURCHASE OF NDS. ACQUISITION COSTS

ARE PRIMARILY COMPRISED OF TRANSACTION FEES AND DIRECT ACQUISITION COSTS, INCLUDING LEGAL, FINANCE, CONSULTING, AND OTHER PROFESSIONAL FEES. THESE COSTS ARE INCLUDED IN IMPAIRMENT, INTEGRATION, AND RESTRUCTURING EXPENSES ON OUR CONSOLIDATED INCOME

STATEMENT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2014.

CERTAIN CONCURRENT TRANSACTIONS WERE RECOGNIZED SEPARATELY FROM THE ACQUISITION. PRIOR TO THE

ACQUISITION, WE HAD JOINT STRATEGIC INITIATIVES WITH NOKIA; THIS CONTRACTUAL RELATIONSHIP WAS TERMINATED IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE ACQUISITION. NO GAIN OR LOSS WAS RECORDED UPON TERMINATION OF THIS AGREEMENT, AS IT WAS DETERMINED TO BE AT MARKET

VALUE. IN ADDITION, WE AGREED TO LICENSE NOKIAS MAPPING SERVICES AND WILL PAY NOKIA SEPARATELY FOR THE SERVICES PROVIDED UNDER A FOUR-YEAR LICENSE AS THEY ARE RENDERED.

DURING FISCAL YEAR 2016, WE COMPLETED 17 ACQUISITIONS FOR TOTAL CASH CONSIDERATION OF

$1.4 BILLION. THESE ENTITIES HAVE BEEN INCLUDED IN OUR CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS SINCE THEIR RESPECTIVE ACQUISITION DATES.

PRO

FORMA RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR MOJANG AND OUR OTHER ACQUISITIONS DURING THE CURRENT PERIOD HAVE NOT BEEN PRESENTED BECAUSE THE EFFECTS OF THESE BUSINESS COMBINATIONS, INDIVIDUALLY AND IN AGGREGATE, WERE NOT MATERIAL TO OUR CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS.

THE MEASUREMENT PERIODS FOR THE VALUATION OF ASSETS ACQUIRED AND LIABILITIES ASSUMED END AS SOON AS INFORMATION ON

THE FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES THAT EXISTED AS OF THE ACQUISITION DATES BECOMES AVAILABLE, BUT DO NOT EXCEED 12 MONTHS. ADJUSTMENTS IN PURCHASE PRICE ALLOCATIONS MAY REQUIRE A RECASTING OF THE AMOUNTS ALLOCATED TO GOODWILL RETROACTIVE TO THE PERIODS IN

WHICH THE ACQUISITIONS OCCURRED.

ANY CHANGE IN THE GOODWILL AMOUNTS RESULTING FROM FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATIONS AND PURCHASE

ACCOUNTING ADJUSTMENTS ARE PRESENTED AS OTHER IN THE ABOVE TABLE. ALSO INCLUDED IN OTHER ARE BUSINESS DISPOSITIONS AND TRANSFERS BETWEEN BUSINESS SEGMENTS DUE TO REORGANIZATIONS, AS APPLICABLE. FOR FISCAL YEAR 2015, A $5.1

BILLION GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT CHARGE WAS INCLUDED IN OTHER, AS DISCUSSED BELOW. THIS GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT CHARGE WAS INCLUDED IN IMPAIRMENT, INTEGRATION, AND RESTRUCTURING EXPENSES ON OUR CONSOLIDATED INCOME STATEMENT, AND REFLECTED IN

CORPORATE AND OTHER IN OUR TABLE OF OPERATING INCOME (LOSS) BY SEGMENT IN NOTE 21  SEGMENT INFORMATION AND GEOGRAPHIC DATA.

OUR

ACCUMULATED GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT AS OF BOTH JUNE 30, 2016 AND 2015 WAS $11.3 BILLION.

AS DISCUSSED IN NOTE 21  SEGMENT

INFORMATION AND GEOGRAPHIC DATA, DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL YEAR 2016 OUR CHIEF OPERATING DECISION MAKER REQUESTED CHANGES IN THE INFORMATION THAT HE REGULARLY REVIEWS FOR PURPOSES OF ALLOCATING RESOURCES AND ASSESSING PERFORMANCE. THIS

RESULTED IN A CHANGE IN OUR OPERATING SEGMENTS AND REPORTING UNITS. WE ALLOCATED GOODWILL TO OUR NEW REPORTING UNITS USING A RELATIVE FAIR VALUE APPROACH. IN ADDITION, WE COMPLETED AN ASSESSMENT OF ANY POTENTIAL GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT FOR ALL REPORTING

UNITS IMMEDIATELY PRIOR TO THE REALLOCATION AND DETERMINED THAT NO IMPAIRMENT EXISTED.

GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT

WE TEST GOODWILL FOR IMPAIRMENT ANNUALLY ON MAY 1 AT THE REPORTING UNIT LEVEL, PRIMARILY USING A DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW METHODOLOGY WITH A

PEER-BASED, RISK-ADJUSTED WEIGHTED AVERAGE COST OF CAPITAL. WE BELIEVE USE OF A DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW APPROACH IS THE MOST RELIABLE INDICATOR OF THE FAIR VALUES OF THE BUSINESSES.

NO INSTANCES OF IMPAIRMENT WERE IDENTIFIED IN OUR MAY 1, 2016 TEST.

UPON COMPLETION OF THE ANNUAL TESTING AS OF MAY 1, 2015, OUR PREVIOUS PHONE HARDWARE REPORTING UNIT GOODWILL WAS DETERMINED TO BE IMPAIRED. PHONE HARDWARE GOODWILL IS INCLUDED IN THE DEVICES REPORTING UNIT

WITHIN MORE PERSONAL COMPUTING UNDER OUR CURRENT SEGMENT STRUCTURE. IN THE SECOND HALF OF FISCAL YEAR 2015, PHONE HARDWARE DID NOT MEET ITS SALES VOLUME AND REVENUE GOALS, AND THE MIX OF UNITS SOLD HAD LOWER MARGINS THAN PLANNED. THESE RESULTS,

ALONG WITH CHANGES IN THE COMPETITIVE MARKETPLACE AND AN EVALUATION OF BUSINESS PRIORITIES, LED TO A SHIFT IN STRATEGIC DIRECTION AND REDUCED FUTURE REVENUE AND PROFITABILITY EXPECTATIONS FOR THE BUSINESS. AS A RESULT OF THESE CHANGES IN STRATEGY

AND EXPECTATIONS, WE FORECASTED REDUCTIONS IN UNIT VOLUME GROWTH RATES AND LOWER FUTURE CASH FLOWS USED TO ESTIMATE THE FAIR VALUE OF THE PHONE HARDWARE REPORTING UNIT, WHICH RESULTED IN THE DETERMINATION THAT AN IMPAIRMENT ADJUSTMENT WAS REQUIRED.

BECAUSE OUR ANNUAL TEST INDICATED THAT PHONE HARDWARES CARRYING VALUE EXCEEDED ITS ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE, A SECOND PHASE OF THE

GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT TEST (STEP 2) WAS PERFORMED SPECIFIC TO PHONE HARDWARE. UNDER STEP 2, THE FAIR VALUE OF ALL PHONE HARDWARE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES WERE ESTIMATED, INCLUDING TANGIBLE ASSETS, EXISTING TECHNOLOGY,

77

TABLE OF CONTENTS

ITEM 8

PATENT AGREEMENTS, AND CONTRACTUAL ARRANGEMENTS, FOR THE PURPOSE OF DERIVING AN ESTIMATE OF THE IMPLIED FAIR VALUE OF GOODWILL. THE IMPLIED FAIR VALUE OF THE GOODWILL WAS THEN COMPARED TO THE

RECORDED GOODWILL TO DETERMINE THE AMOUNT OF THE IMPAIRMENT. ASSUMPTIONS USED IN MEASURING THE VALUE OF THESE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES INCLUDED THE DISCOUNT RATES AND ROYALTY RATES USED IN VALUING THE INTANGIBLE ASSETS, AND CONSIDERATION OF THE MARKET

ENVIRONMENT IN VALUING THE TANGIBLE ASSETS.

NO OTHER INSTANCES OF IMPAIRMENT WERE IDENTIFIED IN OUR MAY 1, 2015 TEST.

IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL YEAR 2016, WE CORRECTED OUR

INTANGIBLE ASSETS IN THE TABLE ABOVE FOR A $585 MILLION MISSTATEMENT BETWEEN GROSS CARRYING AMOUNT AND ACCUMULATED AMORTIZATION AS OF JUNE 30, 2015. WE DO NOT CONSIDER THIS CORRECTION TO BE MATERIAL, AND THERE WAS NO IMPACT TO OUR CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

DURING FISCAL YEAR 2016, WE RECORDED IMPAIRMENT CHARGES OF $480 MILLION RELATED TO INTANGIBLE ASSETS IN THE

DEVICES REPORTING UNIT WITHIN OUR MORE PERSONAL COMPUTING SEGMENT. IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF FISCAL YEAR 2016, WE TESTED THESE INTANGIBLE ASSETS FOR RECOVERABILITY DUE TO CHANGES IN FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES ASSOCIATED WITH THE SHIFT IN STRATEGIC

DIRECTION AND REDUCED PROFITABILITY EXPECTATIONS FOR OUR PHONE BUSINESS. BASED ON THE RESULTS OF OUR TESTING, WE DETERMINED THAT THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE INTANGIBLE ASSETS WAS NOT RECOVERABLE, AND AN IMPAIRMENT CHARGE WAS RECORDED TO THE EXTENT

THAT ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE EXCEEDED CARRYING VALUE. WE PRIMARILY USED THE INCOME APPROACH TO DETERMINE THE FAIR VALUE OF THE INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND DETERMINE THE AMOUNT OF IMPAIRMENT.

DURING FISCAL YEAR 2015, WE RECORDED IMPAIRMENT CHARGES OF $2.2 BILLION RELATED TO INTANGIBLE ASSETS IN OUR PREVIOUS PHONE HARDWARE REPORTING UNIT.

PHONE HARDWARE INTANGIBLE ASSETS ARE INCLUDED IN THE DEVICES REPORTING UNIT UNDER OUR CURRENT SEGMENT STRUCTURE. IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF FISCAL YEAR 2015, WE TESTED THESE INTANGIBLE ASSETS FOR RECOVERABILITY DUE TO CHANGES IN FACTS AND

CIRCUMSTANCES ASSOCIATED WITH THE SHIFT IN STRATEGIC DIRECTION AND REDUCED PROFITABILITY EXPECTATIONS FOR PHONE HARDWARE. BASED ON THE RESULTS OF OUR TESTING, WE DETERMINED THAT THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE INTANGIBLE ASSETS WAS NOT RECOVERABLE, AND AN

IMPAIRMENT CHARGE WAS RECORDED TO THE EXTENT THAT ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE EXCEEDED CARRYING VALUE. WE PRIMARILY USED A RELIEF FROM ROYALTY INCOME APPROACH TO DETERMINE THE FAIR VALUE OF THE INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND DETERMINE THE AMOUNT OF IMPAIRMENT.

THESE INTANGIBLE ASSETS IMPAIRMENT CHARGES WERE INCLUDED IN IMPAIRMENT, INTEGRATION, AND RESTRUCTURING EXPENSES ON OUR CONSOLIDATED

INCOME STATEMENT, AND REFLECTED IN CORPORATE AND OTHER IN OUR TABLE OF OPERATING INCOME (LOSS) BY SEGMENT IN NOTE 21  SEGMENT INFORMATION AND GEOGRAPHIC DATA.

ISSUED AND OUTSTANDING, WITH A WEIGHTED-AVERAGE INTEREST RATE OF 0.11% AND MATURITIES RANGING FROM 8 DAYS TO 63 DAYS. THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF THIS COMMERCIAL PAPER APPROXIMATES ITS CARRYING VALUE.

WE HAVE TWO $5.0 BILLION CREDIT FACILITIES THAT EXPIRE ON NOVEMBER 1, 2016 AND NOVEMBER 14, 2018, RESPECTIVELY. THESE CREDIT FACILITIES

SERVE AS A BACK-UP FOR OUR COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAM. AS OF JUNE 30, 2016, WE WERE IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE ONLY FINANCIAL COVENANT IN BOTH CREDIT AGREEMENTS, WHICH REQUIRES US TO MAINTAIN A COVERAGE RATIO OF AT LEAST THREE TIMES EARNINGS BEFORE

THE REDUCTION FROM THE FEDERAL STATUTORY RATE IS PRIMARILY DUE TO EARNINGS TAXED AT LOWER RATES IN

FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS RESULTING FROM PRODUCING AND DISTRIBUTING OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES THROUGH OUR FOREIGN REGIONAL OPERATIONS CENTERS IN IRELAND, SINGAPORE, AND PUERTO RICO. OUR FOREIGN REGIONAL OPERATING CENTERS, WHICH ARE TAXED AT RATES LOWER

THAN THE U.S. RATE, GENERATED 69%, 73%, AND 81% OF OUR FOREIGN INCOME BEFORE TAX IN FISCAL YEARS 2016, 2015, AND 2014, RESPECTIVELY. IN GENERAL, OTHER RECONCILING ITEMS CONSIST OF INTEREST, U.S. STATE INCOME TAXES, AND CREDITS. IN FISCAL YEARS 2016,

2015, AND 2014, THERE WERE NO INDIVIDUALLY SIGNIFICANT OTHER RECONCILING ITEMS.

THE DECREASE IN OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR FISCAL YEAR

2016 COMPARED TO FISCAL YEAR 2015 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO CHANGES IN THE MIX OF OUR INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES BETWEEN THE U.S. AND FOREIGN COUNTRIES, INCLUDING THE NET IMPACT OF REVENUE DEFERRALS RELATED TO SALES OF WINDOWS 10, TAX BENEFITS FROM THE

ADOPTION OF THE NEW ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE RELATING TO STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION, AND DISTRIBUTIONS FROM FOREIGN AFFILIATES. THE FISCAL YEAR 2015 EFFECTIVE TAX RATE INCLUDED THE TAX IMPACT OF LOSSES IN FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS FOR WHICH WE MAY NOT REALIZE

A TAX BENEFIT, PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF IMPAIRMENT AND RESTRUCTURING CHARGES.

AS OF JUNE 30, 2016, WE HAVE NOT PROVIDED DEFERRED U.S. INCOME TAXES OR FOREIGN WITHHOLDING TAXES ON TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES OF APPROXIMATELY $124.0 BILLION RESULTING FROM EARNINGS FOR CERTAIN NON-U.S.

SUBSIDIARIES WHICH ARE PERMANENTLY REINVESTED OUTSIDE THE U.S. THE UNRECOGNIZED DEFERRED TAX LIABILITY ASSOCIATED WITH THESE TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES WAS APPROXIMATELY $39.3 BILLION AS OF JUNE 30, 2016.

INCOME TAXES PAID WERE $3.9 BILLION, $4.4 BILLION, AND $5.5 BILLION IN FISCAL YEARS 2016, 2015, AND 2014, RESPECTIVELY.

TAX CONTINGENCIES AND OTHER INCOME TAX LIABILITIES WERE $11.8 BILLION AND $12.1 BILLION AS OF JUNE 30, 2016 AND 2015, RESPECTIVELY, AND ARE

INCLUDED IN OTHER LONG-TERM LIABILITIES. THIS DECREASE RELATES PRIMARILY TO TAX CREDITS AVAILABLE FOR CARRYOVER AND A PARTIAL SETTLEMENT OF THE IRS AUDIT FOR TAX YEARS 2007 TO 2009, OFFSET BY INCREASES RELATING TO INTERCOMPANY TRANSFER PRICING.

UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS AS OF JUNE 30, 2016, 2015, AND 2014, WERE $10.2 BILLION, $9.6 BILLION, AND $8.7 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY. IF

RECOGNIZED, THESE TAX BENEFITS WOULD AFFECT OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATES FOR FISCAL YEARS 2016, 2015, AND 2014, BY $8.8 BILLION, $7.9 BILLION, AND $7.0 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY.

AS OF JUNE 30, 2016, 2015, AND 2014, WE HAD ACCRUED INTEREST EXPENSE RELATED TO UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS OF $1.9 BILLION, $1.7 BILLION, AND $1.5 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY, NET OF FEDERAL INCOME TAX BENEFITS.

INTEREST EXPENSE ON UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS WAS $163 MILLION, $237 MILLION, AND $235 MILLION IN FISCAL YEARS 2016, 2015, AND 2014, RESPECTIVELY, AND WAS INCLUDED IN PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES.

AND REOPENED THE AUDIT PHASE OF THE EXAMINATION. AS OF JUNE 30, 2016, THE PRIMARY UNRESOLVED ISSUE RELATES TO TRANSFER PRICING, WHICH COULD HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IF NOT RESOLVED FAVORABLY. WE BELIEVE

OUR ALLOWANCES FOR INCOME TAX CONTINGENCIES ARE ADEQUATE. WE HAVE NOT RECEIVED A PROPOSED ASSESSMENT FOR THE UNRESOLVED ISSUES AND DO NOT EXPECT A FINAL RESOLUTION OF THESE ISSUES IN THE NEXT 12 MONTHS. BASED ON THE INFORMATION CURRENTLY

AVAILABLE, WE DO NOT ANTICIPATE A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE OR DECREASE TO OUR TAX CONTINGENCIES FOR THESE ISSUES WITHIN THE NEXT 12 MONTHS. WE ALSO CONTINUE TO BE SUBJECT TO EXAMINATION BY THE IRS FOR TAX YEARS 2010 TO 2016.

WE ARE SUBJECT TO INCOME TAX IN MANY JURISDICTIONS OUTSIDE THE U.S. OUR OPERATIONS IN CERTAIN JURISDICTIONS REMAIN SUBJECT TO EXAMINATION FOR TAX

YEARS 1996 TO 2016, SOME OF WHICH ARE CURRENTLY UNDER AUDIT BY LOCAL TAX AUTHORITIES. THE RESOLUTIONS OF THESE AUDITS ARE NOT EXPECTED TO BE MATERIAL TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

PHONE HARDWARE INTEGRATION

IN JULY 2014,

WE ANNOUNCED A RESTRUCTURING PLAN TO SIMPLIFY OUR ORGANIZATION AND ALIGN NDS WITH OUR COMPANYS OVERALL STRATEGY (THE PHONE HARDWARE INTEGRATION PLAN). PURSUANT TO THE PHONE HARDWARE INTEGRATION PLAN, WE ELIMINATED APPROXIMATELY

19,000 POSITIONS IN FISCAL YEAR 2015, INCLUDING APPROXIMATELY 13,000 PROFESSIONAL AND FACTORY POSITIONS RELATED TO THE NDS BUSINESS. THE ACTIONS ASSOCIATED WITH THE PHONE HARDWARE INTEGRATION PLAN WERE COMPLETED AS OF JUNE 30, 2015.

IN CONNECTION WITH THE PHONE HARDWARE INTEGRATION PLAN, WE INCURRED TOTAL RESTRUCTURING CHARGES OF $1.3 BILLION, INCLUDING SEVERANCE EXPENSES AND

OTHER REORGANIZATION COSTS, PRIMARILY ASSOCIATED WITH OUR FACILITIES CONSOLIDATION AND WRITE-DOWNS OF CERTAIN ASSETS. ALL RESTRUCTURING CHARGES INCURRED UNDER THE PHONE HARDWARE INTEGRATION PLAN WERE RECOGNIZED IN FISCAL YEAR 2015.

PHONE HARDWARE RESTRUCTURING

IN JUNE 2015,

MANAGEMENT APPROVED A PLAN TO RESTRUCTURE OUR PHONE BUSINESS TO BETTER FOCUS AND ALIGN RESOURCES (THE PHONE HARDWARE RESTRUCTURING PLAN), UNDER WHICH WE ELIMINATED APPROXIMATELY 7,400 POSITIONS IN FISCAL YEAR 2016.

IN FISCAL YEAR 2015, WE INCURRED RESTRUCTURING CHARGES OF $780 MILLION UNDER THE PHONE HARDWARE RESTRUCTURING PLAN, INCLUDING SEVERANCE EXPENSES

AND OTHER REORGANIZATION COSTS. IN FISCAL YEAR 2016, WE REVERSED $21 MILLION OF PREVIOUSLY ESTIMATED RESTRUCTURING CHARGES RELATED TO CONTRACT TERMINATION COSTS. THE ACTIONS ASSOCIATED WITH THE PHONE HARDWARE RESTRUCTURING PLAN WERE SUBSTANTIALLY

COMPLETE AS OF JUNE 30, 2016, AND ARE EXPECTED TO BE COMPLETED BY THE END OF CALENDAR YEAR 2016.

2016 RESTRUCTURING

WE PERIODICALLY EVALUATE HOW TO BEST DEPLOY THE COMPANYS RESOURCES. IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2016, MANAGEMENT APPROVED RESTRUCTURING PLANS

THAT WOULD RESULT IN JOB ELIMINATIONS, PRIMARILY ACROSS OUR SMARTPHONE HARDWARE BUSINESS AND GLOBAL SALES. IN ADDITION TO THE ELIMINATION OF 1,850 POSITIONS THAT WERE ANNOUNCED IN MAY 2016, APPROXIMATELY 2,850 ROLES GLOBALLY WILL BE REDUCED DURING

THE YEAR AS AN EXTENSION OF THE EARLIER PLAN, AND THESE ACTIONS ARE EXPECTED TO BE COMPLETED BY THE END OF FISCAL YEAR 2017.

IN

CONNECTION WITH THE RESTRUCTURING PLANS, WE INCURRED RESTRUCTURING CHARGES OF $501 MILLION IN FISCAL YEAR 2016, INCLUDING SEVERANCE EXPENSES AND OTHER REORGANIZATION COSTS. WE DO NOT EXPECT TO INCUR ADDITIONAL CHARGES FOR THESE RESTRUCTURING PLANS

IN SUBSEQUENT YEARS.

RESTRUCTURING CHARGES ASSOCIATED WITH EACH OF THESE PLANS WERE INCLUDED IN IMPAIRMENT, INTEGRATION, AND

RESTRUCTURING EXPENSES ON OUR CONSOLIDATED INCOME STATEMENT, AND REFLECTED IN CORPORATE AND OTHER IN OUR TABLE OF OPERATING INCOME (LOSS) BY SEGMENT IN NOTE 21 SEGMENT INFORMATION AND GEOGRAPHIC DATA.

PATENT AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY CLAIMS

IPCOM PATENT LITIGATION

IPCOM

GMBH & CO. (IPCOM) IS A GERMAN COMPANY THAT HOLDS A LARGE PORTFOLIO OF MOBILE TECHNOLOGY-RELATED PATENTS SPANNING ABOUT 170 PATENT FAMILIES AND ADDRESSING A BROAD RANGE OF CELLULAR TECHNOLOGIES. IPCOM HAS ASSERTED 19 OF THESE

PATENTS IN LITIGATION AGAINST NOKIA AND MANY OF THE LEADING CELL PHONE COMPANIES AND OPERATORS. IN NOVEMBER 2014, MICROSOFT AND IPCOM ENTERED INTO A STANDSTILL AGREEMENT STAYING ALL OF THE PENDING LITIGATION AGAINST MICROSOFT TO PERMIT THE PARTIES

TO PURSUE SETTLEMENT DISCUSSIONS.

INTERDIGITAL PATENT LITIGATION

INTERDIGITAL TECHNOLOGY CORPORATION AND INTERDIGITAL COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION (COLLECTIVELY, IDT) FILED FOUR PATENT INFRINGEMENT CASES AGAINST NOKIA IN THE INTERNATIONAL TRADE COMMISSION

(ITC) AND IN U.S. DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE BETWEEN 2007 AND 2013. WE HAVE BEEN ADDED TO THESE CASES AS A DEFENDANT. IDT HAS CASES PENDING AGAINST OTHER DEFENDANTS BASED ON THE SAME PATENTS BECAUSE MOST OF THE PATENTS

AT ISSUE ALLEGEDLY RELATE TO 3G AND 4G WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS STANDARDS ESSENTIAL FUNCTIONALITY. THE CASES INVOLVING US INCLUDE THREE ITC INVESTIGATIONS WHERE IDT SOUGHT AN ORDER EXCLUDING IMPORTATION OF 3G AND 4G PHONES INTO THE U.S. AND ONE

ACTIVE CASE IN U.S. DISTRICT COURT IN DELAWARE SEEKING AN INJUNCTION AND DAMAGES. EACH OF THE ITC MATTERS HAS BEEN RESOLVED IN OUR FAVOR. IN SEPTEMBER 2015, IN AN

INTER PARTES

REVIEW THE UNITED STATES PATENT TRIAL AND APPEAL BOARD ISSUED A

FINAL WRITTEN DECISION THAT DEEMED UNPATENTABLE ALL ASSERTED CLAIMS OF THE PATENT REMAINING AT ISSUE IN THE DELAWARE CASE. IDT HAS APPEALED THIS DECISION TO THE U.S. COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE FEDERAL CIRCUIT. THE DELAWARE CASE HAS BEEN STAYED PENDING

FINAL COMPLETION OF THE

INTER PARTES

REVIEW (INCLUDING APPEALS AND ANY SUBSEQUENT PROCEEDINGS IN THE PATENT OFFICE). WE FILED AN ANTITRUST COMPLAINT AGAINST IDT IN THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE IN AUGUST 2015 ASSERTING VIOLATIONS OF SECTION 2

OF THE SHERMAN ACT, ALLEGING THE UNLAWFUL EXPLOITATION OF STANDARD ESSENTIAL PATENTS. IDT FILED A MOTION TO DISMISS, WHICH THE DISTRICT COURT DENIED.

EUROPEAN COPYRIGHT LEVIES

WE ASSUMED FROM

NOKIA ALL POTENTIAL LIABILITY DUE TO NOKIAS ALLEGED FAILURE TO PAY PRIVATE COPYING LEVIES IN VARIOUS EUROPEAN COUNTRIES BASED UPON SALE OF MEMORY CARDS AND MOBILE PHONES THAT INCORPORATE BLANK MEMORY. THE LEVIES ARE BASED UPON

A 2001 EUROPEAN UNION (EU) DIRECTIVE ESTABLISHING A RIGHT FOR END USERS TO MAKE COPIES OF COPYRIGHTED WORKS FOR PERSONAL OR PRIVATE USE, BUT ALSO ALLOWING THE COLLECTION OF LEVIES BASED UPON SALES OF BLANK MEDIA OR RECORDING DEVICES TO

COMPENSATE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS FOR PRIVATE COPYING. VARIOUS COLLECTING SOCIETIES IN EU COUNTRIES INITIATED LITIGATION AGAINST NOKIA, STATING THAT NOKIA MUST PAY LEVIES NOT ONLY BASED UPON SALES OF BLANK MEMORY CARDS, BUT ALSO PHONES THAT INCLUDE

BLANK MEMORY FOR DATA STORAGE ON THE PHONES, REGARDLESS OF ACTUAL USAGE OF THAT MEMORY. THE MOST SIGNIFICANT CASES AGAINST NOKIA ARE PENDING IN GERMANY AND AUSTRIA, DUE TO BOTH THE HIGH VOLUME OF SALES AND HIGH LEVY AMOUNTS SOUGHT IN THESE

COUNTRIES. IN DECEMBER 2015, THE INDUSTRY GROUP BITKOM, OF WHICH WE ARE A MEMBER, REACHED A SETTLEMENT WITH THE GERMAN COLLECTING SOCIETY FOR ALL CLAIMS FROM 2008 FORWARD, LEAVING LITIGATION ONLY FOR THE PERIOD 2004-2007 PENDING IN GERMANY. IN

ADDITION, THE INDUSTRY IS ENGAGED IN SETTLEMENT NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE AUSTRIAN COLLECTING SOCIETY. WE HAVE ALSO SETTLED COPYRIGHT LEVIES LITIGATION IN SPAIN AND FRANCE.

U.S. CELL PHONE LITIGATION

NOKIA, ALONG WITH OTHER HANDSET MANUFACTURERS AND NETWORK OPERATORS, IS A DEFENDANT IN 19 LAWSUITS FILED IN THE SUPERIOR COURT FOR

THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA BY INDIVIDUAL PLAINTIFFS WHO ALLEGE THAT RADIO EMISSIONS FROM CELLULAR HANDSETS CAUSED THEIR BRAIN TUMORS AND OTHER ADVERSE HEALTH EFFECTS. WE ASSUMED RESPONSIBILITY FOR THESE CLAIMS AS PART OF THE NDS ACQUISITION AND HAVE

BEEN SUBSTITUTED FOR THE NOKIA DEFENDANTS. NINE OF THESE CASES WERE FILED IN 2002 AND ARE CONSOLIDATED FOR CERTAIN PRE-TRIAL PROCEEDINGS; THE REMAINING 10 CASES ARE STAYED. IN A SEPARATE 2009 DECISION, THE COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE DISTRICT OF

COLUMBIA HELD THAT ADVERSE HEALTH EFFECT CLAIMS ARISING FROM THE USE OF CELLULAR HANDSETS THAT OPERATE WITHIN THE U.S. FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION RADIO FREQUENCY EMISSION GUIDELINES (FCC GUIDELINES) ARE PRE-EMPTED BY FEDERAL LAW.

THE PLAINTIFFS ALLEGE THAT THEIR HANDSETS EITHER OPERATED OUTSIDE THE FCC GUIDELINES OR WERE MANUFACTURED BEFORE THE FCC GUIDELINES WENT INTO EFFECT. THE LAWSUITS ALSO ALLEGE AN INDUSTRY-WIDE CONSPIRACY TO MANIPULATE THE SCIENCE AND TESTING AROUND

EMISSION GUIDELINES.

IN 2013, DEFENDANTS IN THE CONSOLIDATED CASES MOVED TO EXCLUDE PLAINTIFFS EXPERT EVIDENCE OF GENERAL

CAUSATION ON THE BASIS OF FLAWED SCIENTIFIC METHODOLOGIES. IN 2014, THE COURT GRANTED IN PART DEFENDANTS MOTION TO EXCLUDE PLAINTIFFS GENERAL CAUSATION EXPERTS. THE PLAINTIFFS FILED AN INTERLOCUTORY APPEAL CHALLENGING THE STANDARD FOR

MICROSOFT WAS SERVED WITH THE COMPLAINT IN JUNE 2014 AND HAS BEEN SUBSTITUTED FOR THE NOKIA DEFENDANTS. THE LITIGATION IS NOT YET ACTIVE AS SEVERAL DEFENDANTS REMAIN TO BE SERVED.

WE ALSO ARE SUBJECT TO A VARIETY OF OTHER CLAIMS AND SUITS THAT ARISE FROM TIME TO TIME

IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF OUR BUSINESS. ALTHOUGH MANAGEMENT CURRENTLY BELIEVES THAT RESOLVING CLAIMS AGAINST US, INDIVIDUALLY OR IN AGGREGATE, WILL NOT HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, THESE MATTERS ARE

SUBJECT TO INHERENT UNCERTAINTIES AND MANAGEMENTS VIEW OF THESE MATTERS MAY CHANGE IN THE FUTURE.

AS OF JUNE 30, 2016, WE

ACCRUED AGGREGATE LEGAL LIABILITIES OF $521 MILLION IN OTHER CURRENT LIABILITIES. WHILE WE INTEND TO DEFEND THESE MATTERS VIGOROUSLY, ADVERSE OUTCOMES THAT WE ESTIMATE COULD REACH APPROXIMATELY $1.6 BILLION IN AGGREGATE BEYOND RECORDED AMOUNTS ARE

REASONABLY POSSIBLE. WERE UNFAVORABLE FINAL OUTCOMES TO OCCUR, THERE EXISTS THE POSSIBILITY OF A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE PERIOD IN WHICH THE EFFECTS BECOME REASONABLY ESTIMABLE.

REPORT OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE BASED ON OUR NEW SEGMENTS, PRODUCTIVITY AND BUSINESS PROCESSES, INTELLIGENT CLOUD, AND MORE PERSONAL COMPUTING, AND ANALYZE OPERATING INCOME AS THE MEASURE OF SEGMENT PROFITABILITY. WE HAVE RECAST CERTAIN PRIOR

REDMOND, WASHINGTON

WE HAVE AUDITED THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS OF MICROSOFT

CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES (THE COMPANY) AS OF JUNE 30, 2016 AND 2015, AND THE RELATED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME, COMPREHENSIVE INCOME, CASH FLOWS, AND STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY FOR EACH OF THE THREE YEARS IN THE PERIOD

ENDED JUNE 30, 2016. THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE COMPANYS MANAGEMENT. OUR RESPONSIBILITY IS TO EXPRESS AN OPINION ON THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS BASED ON OUR AUDITS.

WE CONDUCTED OUR AUDITS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE STANDARDS OF THE PUBLIC COMPANY ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BOARD (UNITED STATES). THOSE STANDARDS

REQUIRE THAT WE PLAN AND PERFORM THE AUDIT TO OBTAIN REASONABLE ASSURANCE ABOUT WHETHER THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE FREE OF MATERIAL MISSTATEMENT. AN AUDIT INCLUDES EXAMINING, ON A TEST BASIS, EVIDENCE SUPPORTING THE AMOUNTS AND DISCLOSURES IN

THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. AN AUDIT ALSO INCLUDES ASSESSING THE ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES USED AND SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES MADE BY MANAGEMENT, AS WELL AS EVALUATING THE OVERALL FINANCIAL STATEMENT PRESENTATION. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR AUDITS PROVIDE A

REASONABLE BASIS FOR OUR OPINION.

IN OUR OPINION, SUCH CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS PRESENT FAIRLY, IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS, THE

FINANCIAL POSITION OF MICROSOFT CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES AS OF JUNE 30, 2016 AND 2015, AND THE RESULTS OF THEIR OPERATIONS AND THEIR CASH FLOWS FOR EACH OF THE THREE YEARS IN THE PERIOD ENDED JUNE 30, 2016, IN CONFORMITY WITH

ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.

UNDER THE SUPERVISION AND

WITH THE PARTICIPATION OF OUR MANAGEMENT, INCLUDING THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER, WE HAVE EVALUATED THE EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES AS REQUIRED BY EXCHANGE ACT RULE 13A-15(B) AS OF THE END OF

THE PERIOD COVERED BY THIS REPORT. BASED ON THAT EVALUATION, THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER HAVE CONCLUDED THAT THESE DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES ARE EFFECTIVE.

REPORT OF MANAGEMENT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

OUR MANAGEMENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ESTABLISHING AND MAINTAINING ADEQUATE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING FOR THE COMPANY. INTERNAL CONTROL

OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING IS A PROCESS TO PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING THE RELIABILITY OF OUR FINANCIAL REPORTING FOR EXTERNAL PURPOSES IN ACCORDANCE WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. INTERNAL

CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING INCLUDES MAINTAINING RECORDS THAT IN REASONABLE DETAIL ACCURATELY AND FAIRLY REFLECT OUR TRANSACTIONS; PROVIDING REASONABLE ASSURANCE THAT TRANSACTIONS ARE RECORDED AS NECESSARY FOR PREPARATION OF OUR FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS; PROVIDING REASONABLE ASSURANCE THAT RECEIPTS AND EXPENDITURES OF COMPANY ASSETS ARE MADE IN ACCORDANCE WITH MANAGEMENT AUTHORIZATION; AND PROVIDING REASONABLE ASSURANCE THAT UNAUTHORIZED ACQUISITION, USE, OR DISPOSITION OF COMPANY ASSETS

THAT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS WOULD BE PREVENTED OR DETECTED ON A TIMELY BASIS. BECAUSE OF ITS INHERENT LIMITATIONS, INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING IS NOT INTENDED TO PROVIDE ABSOLUTE ASSURANCE THAT A

MISSTATEMENT OF OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS WOULD BE PREVENTED OR DETECTED.

MANAGEMENT CONDUCTED AN EVALUATION OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR

INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING BASED ON THE FRAMEWORK IN

INTERNAL CONTROL  INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK (2013)

ISSUED BY THE COMMITTEE OF SPONSORING ORGANIZATIONS OF THE TREADWAY COMMISSION. BASED ON THIS EVALUATION, MANAGEMENT

CONCLUDED THAT THE COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING WAS EFFECTIVE AS OF JUNE 30, 2016. THERE WERE NO CHANGES IN OUR INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING DURING THE QUARTER ENDED JUNE 30, 2016 THAT HAVE

MATERIALLY AFFECTED, OR ARE REASONABLY LIKELY TO MATERIALLY AFFECT, OUR INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING. DELOITTE & TOUCHE LLP HAS AUDITED OUR INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF JUNE 30, 2016; THEIR REPORT IS

EPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

TO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND STOCKHOLDERS OF MICROSOFT CORPORATION

REDMOND, WASHINGTON

WE HAVE AUDITED THE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING OF MICROSOFT

CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES (THE COMPANY) AS OF JUNE 30, 2016, BASED ON CRITERIA ESTABLISHED IN

INTERNAL CONTROL  INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK (2013)

ISSUED BY THE COMMITTEE OF SPONSORING ORGANIZATIONS OF THE TREADWAY

COMMISSION. THE COMPANYS MANAGEMENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR MAINTAINING EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AND FOR ITS ASSESSMENT OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, INCLUDED IN THE ACCOMPANYING

REPORT OF MANAGEMENT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING. OUR RESPONSIBILITY IS TO EXPRESS AN OPINION ON THE COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING BASED ON OUR AUDIT.

WE CONDUCTED OUR AUDIT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE STANDARDS OF THE PUBLIC COMPANY ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BOARD (UNITED STATES). THOSE STANDARDS

REQUIRE THAT WE PLAN AND PERFORM THE AUDIT TO OBTAIN REASONABLE ASSURANCE ABOUT WHETHER EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING WAS MAINTAINED IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS. OUR AUDIT INCLUDED OBTAINING AN UNDERSTANDING OF INTERNAL

CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, ASSESSING THE RISK THAT A MATERIAL WEAKNESS EXISTS, TESTING AND EVALUATING THE DESIGN AND OPERATING EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL CONTROL BASED ON THE ASSESSED RISK, AND PERFORMING SUCH OTHER PROCEDURES AS WE CONSIDERED

NECESSARY IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR AUDIT PROVIDES A REASONABLE BASIS FOR OUR OPINION.

A COMPANYS INTERNAL

CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING IS A PROCESS DESIGNED BY, OR UNDER THE SUPERVISION OF, THE COMPANYS PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE AND PRINCIPAL FINANCIAL OFFICERS, OR PERSONS PERFORMING SIMILAR FUNCTIONS, AND EFFECTED BY THE COMPANYS BOARD OF

DIRECTORS, MANAGEMENT, AND OTHER PERSONNEL TO PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING THE RELIABILITY OF FINANCIAL REPORTING AND THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR EXTERNAL PURPOSES IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING

PRINCIPLES. A COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING INCLUDES THOSE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES THAT (1) PERTAIN TO THE MAINTENANCE OF RECORDS THAT, IN REASONABLE DETAIL, ACCURATELY AND FAIRLY REFLECT THE TRANSACTIONS AND

DISPOSITIONS OF THE ASSETS OF THE COMPANY; (2) PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE THAT TRANSACTIONS ARE RECORDED AS NECESSARY TO PERMIT PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES, AND THAT RECEIPTS AND

EXPENDITURES OF THE COMPANY ARE BEING MADE ONLY IN ACCORDANCE WITH AUTHORIZATIONS OF MANAGEMENT AND DIRECTORS OF THE COMPANY; AND (3) PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING PREVENTION OR TIMELY DETECTION OF UNAUTHORIZED ACQUISITION, USE, OR

DISPOSITION OF THE COMPANYS ASSETS THAT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

BECAUSE OF THE INHERENT

LIMITATIONS OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, INCLUDING THE POSSIBILITY OF COLLUSION OR IMPROPER MANAGEMENT OVERRIDE OF CONTROLS, MATERIAL MISSTATEMENTS DUE TO ERROR OR FRAUD MAY NOT BE PREVENTED OR DETECTED ON A TIMELY BASIS. ALSO,

PROJECTIONS OF ANY EVALUATION OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING TO FUTURE PERIODS ARE SUBJECT TO THE RISK THAT THE CONTROLS MAY BECOME INADEQUATE BECAUSE OF CHANGES IN CONDITIONS, OR THAT THE DEGREE OF COMPLIANCE

WITH THE POLICIES OR PROCEDURES MAY DETERIORATE.

IN OUR OPINION, THE COMPANY MAINTAINED, IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS, EFFECTIVE INTERNAL

CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF JUNE 30, 2016, BASED ON THE CRITERIA ESTABLISHED IN

INTERNAL CONTROL  INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK (2013)

ISSUED BY THE COMMITTEE OF SPONSORING ORGANIZATIONS OF THE TREADWAY COMMISSION.

WE HAVE ALSO AUDITED, IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE STANDARDS OF THE PUBLIC COMPANY ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BOARD (UNITED STATES), THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS AS OF AND FOR THE YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2016 OF THE COMPANY AND OUR REPORT DATED JULY 28, 2016 EXPRESSED AN UNQUALIFIED OPINION ON THOSE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.
