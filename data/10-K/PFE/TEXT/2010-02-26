GENERAL

PFIZER INC. (WHICH MAY BE REFERRED TO AS

PFIZER, THE COMPANY, WE, US OR

OUR

) IS A RESEARCH-BASED, GLOBAL BIOPHARMACEUTICAL COMPANY. WE APPLY SCIENCE AND OUR GLOBAL RESOURCES TO IMPROVE HEALTH AND WELL-BEING AT EVERY STAGE OF LIFE. WE STRIVE TO SET THE STANDARD FOR QUALITY, SAFETY AND VALUE IN THE DISCOVERY,

DEVELOPMENT AND MANUFACTURE OF MEDICINES FOR PEOPLE AND ANIMALS. OUR DIVERSIFIED GLOBAL HEALTH CARE PORTFOLIO INCLUDES HUMAN AND ANIMAL BIOLOGIC AND SMALL MOLECULE MEDICINES AND VACCINES, AS WELL AS NUTRITIONAL PRODUCTS AND MANY OF THE

WORLDS BEST-KNOWN CONSUMER HEALTH CARE PRODUCTS. EVERY DAY, WE WORK ACROSS DEVELOPED AND EMERGING MARKETS TO ADVANCE WELLNESS, PREVENTION, TREATMENTS AND CURES THAT CHALLENGE THE MOST FEARED DISEASES OF OUR TIME. CONSISTENT WITH OUR

RESPONSIBILITY AS THE WORLDS LEADING BIOPHARMACEUTICAL COMPANY, WE ALSO COLLABORATE WITH OTHER BIOPHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES, HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS, GOVERNMENTS AND LOCAL COMMUNITIES TO SUPPORT AND EXPAND ACCESS TO RELIABLE, AFFORDABLE HEALTH

CARE AROUND THE WORLD.

THE COMPANY WAS INCORPORATED UNDER THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE ON JUNE 2, 1942.

ON OCTOBER 15, 2009, WE COMPLETED OUR ACQUISITION OF WYETH. THE ACQUISITION WAS A CASH-AND-STOCK TRANSACTION VALUED, BASED ON THE

CLOSING MARKET PRICE OF PFIZERS COMMON STOCK ON THE ACQUISITION DATE, AT $50.40 PER SHARE OF WYETH COMMON STOCK, OR A TOTAL OF APPROXIMATELY $68 BILLION.

IN RESPONSE TO THE CHALLENGING OPERATING ENVIRONMENT, WE HAVE TAKEN MANY STEPS TO STRENGTHEN OUR COMPANY AND BETTER POSITION OURSELVES FOR THE FUTURE. THE MOST IMPORTANT OF THESE STEPS WAS THE ACQUISITION

OF WYETH, WHICH HAS TRANSFORMED US INTO A MORE DIVERSIFIED HEALTH CARE COMPANY, WITH PRODUCT OFFERINGS IN HUMAN AND ANIMAL HEALTH, INCLUDING VACCINES, BIOLOGICS, SMALL MOLECULES AND NUTRITION ACROSS DEVELOPED AND EMERGING MARKETS. WE BELIEVE THAT

OUR ACQUISITION OF WYETH MEANINGFULLY ADVANCES, IN A SINGLE TRANSACTION, EACH OF THE STRATEGIC PRIORITIES THAT WE HAVE IDENTIFIED AND PURSUED OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS, INCLUDING.



ENHANCING THE IN-LINE AND PATENT-PROTECTED PIPELINE PORTFOLIO IN KEY INVEST TO WIN AREAS OF

RESEARCH WHERE THERE EXIST SIGNIFICANT UNMET MEDICAL NEEDS AND SIGNIFICANT OPPORTUNITIES FOR INNOVATION AND MARKET LEADERSHIP, SUCH AS ONCOLOGY, PAIN, INFLAMMATION, ALZHEIMERS DISEASE,

PSYCHOSES AND DIABETES AS WELL AS THE CRITICAL TECHNOLOGIES OF VACCINES AND BIOLOGICS;



BECOMING A TOP-TIER PLAYER IN BIOTHERAPEUTICS BY 2015;

ACCELERATING GROWTH IN EMERGING MARKETS;



CREATING NEW OPPORTUNITIES FOR ESTABLISHED PRODUCTS;



INVESTING IN COMPLEMENTARY BUSINESSES; AND



CREATING A LOWER, MORE FLEXIBLE COST BASE FOR THE COMBINED COMPANY.

WORLDWIDE BIOPHARMACEUTICAL REVENUES IN 2009 WERE $45.4 BILLION, AN INCREASE OF 3% COMPARED TO 2008,

PRIMARILY DUE TO REVENUES FROM LEGACY WYETH PRODUCTS OF APPROXIMATELY $2.5 BILLION, SOLID OPERATIONAL PERFORMANCE FROM CERTAIN LEGACY PFIZER PRODUCTS, INCLUDING

LYRICA

,

SUTENT

AND

REVATIO

, AND HIGHER LEGACY PFIZER ALLIANCE

REVENUES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE STRENGTHENING OF THE U.S. DOLLAR RELATIVE TO OTHER CURRENCIES, PRIMARILY THE EURO, U.K. POUND, CANADIAN DOLLAR, AUSTRALIAN DOLLAR AND BRAZILIAN REAL, WHICH UNFAVORABLY IMPACTED BIOPHARMACEUTICAL REVENUES BY

APPROXIMATELY $1.7 BILLION, OR 4%, IN 2009, AND A DECREASE IN REVENUES FROM CERTAIN LEGACY PFIZER PRODUCTS, INCLUDING

LIPITOR, NORVASC

,

LYRICA, VIAGRA, REVATIO, XALATAN

AND

SUTENT

, AND HIGHER ALLIANCE REVENUE IN 2009 WHICH WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER REVENUES FROM CERTAIN LEGACY PFIZER PRODUCTS INCLUDING

LIPITOR

CELEBREX,

COMPARED TO 2008, AS A RESULT OF CONTINUED GENERIC PRESSURES. LEGACY

CAMPTOSAR

AND

ZYRTEC/ZYRTEC D

, LOWER SALES OF

CHANTIX

FOLLOWING CHANGES TO THE PRODUCT LABEL, INCREASED REBATES PARTLY AS A RESULT OF THE IMPACT OF

CERTAIN CONTRACT CHANGES, AND INCREASED PRICING PRESSURES.

IN OUR INTERNATIONAL MARKETS, BIOPHARMACEUTICAL REVENUES WERE FLAT

IN 2009, COMPARED TO 2008. HIGHER REVENUES DUE TO THE ADDITION OF LEGACY WYETH PRODUCTS OF $931 MILLION, OR 4%, AND HIGHER OPERATIONAL REVENUES FROM LEGACY PFIZER PRODUCTS OF $854 MILLION, OR 3%, WERE OFFSET BY THE UNFAVORABLE IMPACT OF FOREIGN

EXCHANGE ON INTERNATIONAL REVENUES OF $1.7 BILLION, OR 7%. THE INCREASE IN OPERATIONAL REVENUES OF LEGACY PFIZER PRODUCTS WAS DUE TO OPERATIONAL GROWTH FROM

LIPITOR, LYRICA, ZYVOX, VFEND

NUTRITION

PFIZER NUTRITION, WHICH

IS A LEGACY WYETH UNIT, IS A LEADER IN INFANT NUTRITIONALS IN THE MARKETS IN WHICH WE OPERATE. WE HAVE A FOCUSED PRESENCE IN KEY MARKETS THROUGHOUT ASIA, THE MIDDLE EAST, EUROPE AND LATIN AMERICA WITH CHINA, THE PHILIPPINES, THE UK, MEXICO AND

AUSTRALIA BEING AMONG OUR TOP MARKETS. AS PART OF PFIZER, NUTRITION WILL HAVE ENHANCED OPPORTUNITIES TO GROW IN NEW AND EXISTING MARKETS, AS WELL AS TO LEVERAGE STRENGTHS FROM THE COMBINED COMPANY TO ACCELERATE INNOVATION AND DEVELOP NEW PRODUCTS.

REVENUES OF $191 MILLION FOR 2009 REFLECT REVENUE GENERATED BY PFIZER NUTRITION AFTER THE CLOSE OF THE WYETH ACQUISITION ON OCTOBER 15, 2009.

NUTRITION PRODUCTS INCLUDE OUR S26 PRETERM FEEDING SYSTEM, SPECIALTY FORMULAS SUCH AS

S26 PE

GOLD

AND A RANGE OF AGE-SPECIFIC PRODUCTS THAT INCLUDE

S26 PE GOLD, PROGRESS, PROMIL AND

PROMISE.

CAPSUGEL

CAPSUGEL HAS A DIVERSE PRODUCT LINE THAT INCLUDES NOT ONLY HARD GELATIN CAPSULES, BUT ALSO LIQUID, SOFTGEL, NON-ANIMAL, AND FISH GELATIN CAPSULES, ALL FOR USE IN PHARMACEUTICAL AND DIETARY SUPPLEMENT DOSAGE DELIVERY.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

INNOVATION BY OUR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT OPERATIONS IS VERY IMPORTANT TO THE COMPANYS SUCCESS. OUR GOAL IS TO DISCOVER, DEVELOP AND

BRING TO MARKET INNOVATIVE PRODUCTS THAT ADDRESS MAJOR UNMET MEDICAL NEEDS. THIS GOAL HAS BEEN SUPPORTED BY OUR SUBSTANTIAL RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT INVESTMENTS. WE SPENT $7.8 BILLION IN 2009, $7.9 BILLION IN 2008 AND $8.1 BILLION IN 2007 ON

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT.

WE CONDUCT RESEARCH INTERNALLY AND ALSO THROUGH CONTRACTS WITH THIRD PARTIES, THROUGH

COLLABORATIONS WITH UNIVERSITIES AND BIOTECHNOLOGY COMPANIES AND IN COOPERATION WITH OTHER PHARMACEUTICAL FIRMS. WE ALSO SEEK OUT PROMISING COMPOUNDS AND INNOVATIVE TECHNOLOGIES DEVELOPED BY THIRD PARTIES TO INCORPORATE INTO OUR DISCOVERY OR

DEVELOPMENT PROCESSES OR PROJECTS, AS WELL AS OUR PRODUCT LINES, THROUGH ACQUISITION, LICENSING OR OTHER ARRANGEMENTS.

DRUG

DISCOVERY AND DEVELOPMENT IS TIME CONSUMING, EXPENSIVE AND UNPREDICTABLE. ACCORDING TO THE PHARMACEUTICAL RESEARCH AND MANUFACTURERS OF AMERICA (PHRMA), OUT OF 5,000-10,000 SCREENED COMPOUNDS, ONLY 250 ENTER PRECLINICAL TESTING, FIVE ENTER HUMAN

CLINICAL TRIALS AND ONE IS APPROVED BY THE FDA. THE PROCESS FROM EARLY DISCOVERY OR DESIGN TO DEVELOPMENT TO REGULATORY APPROVAL CAN TAKE MORE THAN TEN YEARS. DRUG CANDIDATES CAN FAIL AT ANY STAGE OF THE PROCESS. CANDIDATES MAY NOT RECEIVE

REGULATORY APPROVAL EVEN AFTER MANY YEARS OF RESEARCH.

WE BELIEVE THAT THE EFFECT OF OUR SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS IN RESEARCH

IS REFLECTED IN THE NUMBER OF ROBUST PHARMACEUTICAL CANDIDATES WE HAVE IN ALL STAGES OF DEVELOPMENT. AS OF JANUARY 27, 2010, WE HAD ABOUT 500 PROJECTS IN DEVELOPMENT, RANGING FROM DISCOVERY THROUGH REGISTRATION, OF WHICH 133 PROGRAMS ARE FROM

PHASE 1 THROUGH REGISTRATION. THE PROJECTS WITHIN OUR INVEST TO WIN AREAS INCLUDE 30 COMPOUNDS FOR VARIOUS ONCOLOGY INDICATIONS, 10 COMPOUNDS FOR ALZHEIMERS DISEASE, EIGHT COMPOUNDS FOR PAIN, 11 COMPOUNDS FOR INFLAMMATION, SIX

VACCINES AND 27 BIOLOGICS. AT YEAR-END 2009, OUR PHASE III PORTFOLIO CONTAINED 34 PROGRAMS. WHILE THESE NEW CANDIDATES MAY OR MAY NOT EVENTUALLY RECEIVE REGULATORY APPROVAL, NEW DRUG CANDIDATES ENTERING DEVELOPMENT ARE THE FOUNDATION FOR FUTURE

PRODUCTS.

IN ADDITION TO DISCOVERING AND DEVELOPING NEW PRODUCTS, OUR RESEARCH OPERATIONS SEEK TO ADD VALUE TO

OUR COMPETITORS ALSO DEVOTE SUBSTANTIAL FUNDS AND RESOURCES

TO RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT. WE ALSO COMPETE AGAINST NUMEROUS SMALL BIOTECHNOLOGY COMPANIES IN DEVELOPING POTENTIAL DRUG CANDIDATES. THE EXTENT TO WHICH OUR COMPETITORS ARE SUCCESSFUL IN THEIR RESEARCH COULD RESULT IN EROSION OF THE SALES OF OUR

PRODUCTS AND UNANTICIPATED PRODUCT OBSOLESCENCE.

INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS

WE HAVE SIGNIFICANT OPERATIONS OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES. THEY ARE MANAGED THROUGH THE SAME SEGMENTS AS OUR U.S.

OPERATIONSBIOPHARMACEUTICAL AND DIVERSIFIED.

REVENUES FROM OPERATIONS OUTSIDE THE U.S. OF $28.3 BILLION ACCOUNTED FOR

57% OF OUR TOTAL REVENUES IN 2009. REVENUES EXCEEDED $500 MILLION IN EACH OF 13 COUNTRIES OUTSIDE THE U.S. IN 2009. THE U.S. WAS THE ONLY COUNTRY TO CONTRIBUTE MORE THAN 10% OF OUR TOTAL REVENUES, COMPRISING 43% OF TOTAL REVENUES IN 2009, 42.3% OF

TOTAL REVENUES IN 2008 AND 47.8% OF TOTAL REVENUES IN 2007. JAPAN IS OUR SECOND-LARGEST NATIONAL MARKET, WITH 8.5% OF TOTAL REVENUES IN 2009, 7.7% OF TOTAL REVENUES IN 2008 AND 7.0% OF TOTAL REVENUES IN 2007.

OUR INTERNATIONAL BUSINESSES ARE SUBJECT, IN VARYING DEGREES, TO A NUMBER OF RISKS INHERENT IN CARRYING ON

BUSINESS IN OTHER COUNTRIES. THESE INCLUDE CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS, CAPITAL AND EXCHANGE CONTROL REGULATIONS, EXPROPRIATION AND OTHER RESTRICTIVE GOVERNMENT ACTIONS. OUR INTERNATIONAL BUSINESSES ARE

ALSO SUBJECT TO GOVERNMENT-IMPOSED CONSTRAINTS, INCLUDING LAWS ON PRICING, REIMBURSEMENT AND ACCESS TO OUR PRODUCTS. SEE

GOVERNMENT REGULATION AND PRICE CONSTRAINTS

OF THESE MATTERS.

DEPENDING ON THE DIRECTION OF CHANGE RELATIVE TO THE U.S. DOLLAR, FOREIGN CURRENCY VALUES CAN INCREASE OR

DECREASE THE REPORTED DOLLAR VALUE OF OUR NET ASSETS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. IN 2009, BOTH REVENUES AND NET INCOME WERE UNFAVORABLY IMPACTED BY FOREIGN EXCHANGE IN GENERAL, AS FOREIGN CURRENCY MOVEMENTS RELATIVE TO THE U.S. DOLLAR DECREASED OUR

REVENUES AND NET INCOME IN MANY COUNTRIES. WHILE WE CANNOT PREDICT WITH CERTAINTY FUTURE CHANGES IN FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES OR THE EFFECT THEY WILL HAVE ON US, WE ATTEMPT TO MITIGATE THEIR IMPACT THROUGH OPERATIONAL MEANS AND BY USING VARIOUS

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS. SEE THE DISCUSSION UNDER NOTE 9-E TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS,

MARKETING

IN OUR GLOBAL BIOPHARMACEUTICAL

SEGMENT, WE PROMOTE OUR PRODUCTS TO HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS AND PATIENTS. THROUGH OUR MARKETING ORGANIZATIONS, WE EXPLAIN THE APPROVED USES, BENEFITS AND RISKS OF OUR PRODUCTS TO HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS, SUCH AS DOCTORS, NURSE PRACTITIONERS, PHYSICIAN

ASSISTANTS, PHARMACISTS, HOSPITALS, PHARMACY BENEFIT MANAGERS (PBMS), MANAGED CARE ORGANIZATIONS (MCOS), EMPLOYERS AND GOVERNMENT AGENCIES. WE ALSO MARKET DIRECTLY TO CONSUMERS IN THE U.S. THROUGH DIRECT-TO-CONSUMER ADVERTISING THAT COMMUNICATES THE

APPROVED USES, BENEFITS AND RISKS OF OUR PRODUCTS WHILE CONTINUING TO MOTIVATE PEOPLE TO HAVE MEANINGFUL CONVERSATIONS WITH THEIR DOCTORS. IN ADDITION, WE SPONSOR GENERAL ADVERTISING TO EDUCATE THE PUBLIC ON DISEASE AWARENESS, PREVENTION AND

WELLNESS, IMPORTANT PUBLIC HEALTH ISSUES, AND OUR PATIENT ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS.

IN JANUARY 2009, WE ANNOUNCED THE CREATION OF

CUSTOMER-FOCUSED UNITS WITHIN OUR BIOPHARMACEUTICAL SEGMENT TO BETTER MEET THE DIVERSE NEEDS OF PHYSICIANS, PATIENTS AND OUR CUSTOMERS WHILE MAXIMIZING VALUE FOR OUR COMPANY AND OUR SHAREHOLDERS.

7

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE BIOPHARMACEUTICAL SEGMENT INCLUDES FIVE HUMAN HEALTH, CUSTOMER-FOCUSED UNITS: PRIMARY

CARE, SPECIALTY CARE, ONCOLOGY, ESTABLISHED PRODUCTS AND EMERGING MARKETS. UPON THE CLOSING OF THE WYETH ACQUISITION ON OCTOBER 15, 2009, OUR SPECIALTY CARE CUSTOMER-FOCUSED UNIT EXPANDED TO INCLUDE VACCINES.

IN APRIL 2009 IN THE U.S., WE ALSO RESTRUCTURED INTO REGIONAL UNITS IN ORDER TO CREATE A MORE FLEXIBLE ORGANIZATION EMPOWERED TO IDENTIFY

AND ADDRESS LOCAL MARKET DYNAMICS AND CUSTOMER NEEDS. OUR STRUCTURE ALIGNS THE SALES, MARKETING, AND MEDICAL FUNCTIONS TO WORK CLOSELY TO MEET THE NEEDS OF KEY CUSTOMER SEGMENTS WHILE ENSURING COMMON COORDINATION, FOCUS AND ACCOUNTABILITY ACROSS THE

ORGANIZATIONS.

OUR PRESCRIPTION PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS ARE SOLD PRINCIPALLY TO WHOLESALERS, BUT WE ALSO SELL DIRECTLY TO

RETAILERS, HOSPITALS, CLINICS, GOVERNMENT AGENCIES AND PHARMACIES. WE SEEK TO GAIN ACCESS TO HEALTH AUTHORITY, PBM AND MCO FORMULARIES (LISTS OF RECOMMENDED, APPROVED, AND/OR REIMBURSED MEDICINES AND OTHER PRODUCTS). WE ALSO WORK WITH MCOS, PBMS,

EMPLOYERS AND OTHER APPROPRIATE HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS TO ASSIST THEM WITH DISEASE MANAGEMENT, PATIENT EDUCATION AND OTHER TOOLS THAT HELP THEIR MEDICAL TREATMENT ROUTINES.

DURING 2009, PFIZER REVENUES GENERATED FROM OUR THREE LARGEST BIOPHARMACEUTICAL WHOLESALERS WERE AS FOLLOWS.



MCKESSON, INC.17% OF OUR TOTAL REVENUES;



CARDINAL HEALTH, INC.11% OF OUR TOTAL REVENUES; AND



AMERISOURCEBERGEN CORPORATION10% OF OUR TOTAL REVENUES.

SALES TO THESE WHOLESALERS WERE CONCENTRATED IN THE BIOPHARMACEUTICAL SEGMENT. APART FROM THESE INSTANCES, NEITHER OF OUR BUSINESS SEGMENTS

IS DEPENDENT ON ANY ONE CUSTOMER OR GROUP OF RELATED CUSTOMERS.

OUR GLOBAL DIVERSIFIED SEGMENT CONSISTS OF FOUR GLOBAL UNITS.

ANIMAL HEALTH, CONSUMER HEALTHCARE, NUTRITION AND CAPSUGEL. EACH UNIT UTILIZES ITS OWN SALES AND MARKETING ORGANIZATION TO PROMOTE ITS PRODUCTS, AND OCCASIONALLY USES DISTRIBUTORS IN SMALLER MARKETS.

OUR ANIMAL HEALTH UNITS ADVERTISING AND PROMOTIONS ARE GENERALLY TARGETED TO HEALTH

CARE PROFESSIONALS, DIRECTLY AND THROUGH VETERINARY JOURNALS. ANIMAL HEALTH PRODUCTS ARE SOLD THROUGH VETERINARIANS, DISTRIBUTORS AND RETAIL OUTLETS AS WELL AS DIRECTLY TO USERS.

OUR CONSUMER HEALTHCARE UNITS ADVERTISING AND PROMOTIONS ARE GENERALLY TARGETED TO CONSUMERS THROUGH TELEVISION, PRINT AND OTHER MEDIA

ADVERTISING, AS WELL AS THROUGH IN-STORE PROMOTION. CONSUMER HEALTHCARE PRODUCTS ARE SOLD THROUGH A WIDE VARIETY OF CHANNELS, INCLUDING DISTRIBUTORS, PHARMACIES AND RETAIL CHAINS.

OUR NUTRITION UNIT SUPPORTS AND ADHERES TO THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION CODE AND NATIONAL CODES ON THE MARKETING OF BREAST MILK

SUBSTITUTES. NUTRITION ENCOURAGES BREASTFEEDING AS THE BEST NUTRITION FOR INFANTS, AND PROVIDES IMPORTANT PRODUCTS FOR INFANTS WHO ARE NOT EXCLUSIVELY BREASTFED. ADVERTISING AND PROMOTION OF OUR NUTRITION PRODUCTS FOR OLDER CHILDREN

AND ADULTS GENERALLY TARGET CONSUMERS AND HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS THROUGH PRINT AND MEDIA ADVERTISING AND TELEVISION. OUR NUTRITION PRODUCTS ARE SOLD THROUGH A WIDE VARIETY OF CHANNELS, INCLUDING DISTRIBUTORS, PHARMACIES, HOSPITALS AND

RETAIL CHAINS.

PATENTS AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS

OUR PRODUCTS ARE SOLD AROUND THE WORLD UNDER BRAND-NAME, LOGO AND CERTAIN PRODUCT DESIGN TRADEMARKS THAT WE CONSIDER IN THE AGGREGATE TO BE

OF MATERIAL IMPORTANCE. TRADEMARK PROTECTION CONTINUES IN SOME COUNTRIES FOR AS LONG AS THE MARK IS USED AND, IN OTHER COUNTRIES, FOR AS LONG AS IT IS REGISTERED. REGISTRATIONS GENERALLY ARE FOR FIXED, BUT RENEWABLE, TERMS.

WE OWN OR LICENSE A NUMBER OF U.S. AND FOREIGN PATENTS. THESE PATENTS COVER PHARMACEUTICAL AND OTHER PRODUCTS AND THEIR USES, PHARMACEUTICAL

FORMULATIONS, PRODUCT MANUFACTURING PROCESSES AND INTERMEDIATE CHEMICAL COMPOUNDS USED IN MANUFACTURING.

PATENTS FOR

INDIVIDUAL PRODUCTS EXTEND FOR VARYING PERIODS ACCORDING TO THE DATE OF PATENT FILING OR GRANT AND THE LEGAL TERM OF PATENTS IN THE VARIOUS COUNTRIES WHERE PATENT PROTECTION IS OBTAINED. THE ACTUAL PROTECTION AFFORDED BY A PATENT, WHICH CAN VARY

FROM COUNTRY TO COUNTRY, DEPENDS UPON THE TYPE

TABLE OF CONTENTS

OF PATENT, THE SCOPE OF ITS COVERAGE AND THE AVAILABILITY OF LEGAL REMEDIES IN THE COUNTRY.

IN THE AGGREGATE, OUR PATENT AND RELATED RIGHTS ARE OF MATERIAL IMPORTANCE TO OUR BUSINESSES IN THE U.S. AND MOST OTHER COUNTRIES. BASED ON CURRENT PRODUCT SALES, AND CONSIDERING THE VIGOROUS COMPETITION

WITH PRODUCTS SOLD BY OTHERS, THE PATENT RIGHTS WE CONSIDER MOST SIGNIFICANT IN RELATION TO OUR BUSINESS AS A WHOLE, TOGETHER WITH THE YEAR IN WHICH THE U.S. BASIC PRODUCT PATENT EXPIRES (INCLUDING, WHERE APPLICABLE, THE ADDITIONAL SIX-MONTH

PEDIATRIC EXCLUSIVITY PERIOD), ARE THOSE FOR THE DRUGS SET FORTH IN THE TABLE BELOW.

RELATING TO EXTENDED RELEASE FORMULATIONS AND METHODS OF USING EXTENDED RELEASE FORMULATIONS OF VENLAFAXINE HCI. IN 2005, WYETH ENTERED INTO A SETTLEMENT OF PATENT LITIGATION AGAINST TEVA PHARMACEUTICALS USA, INC. (TEVA USA) AND TEVA PHARMACEUTICAL

EFFEXOR XR

IN THE U.S. BEGINNING ON JULY 1, 2010, SUBJECT TO POSSIBLE EARLIER LAUNCH BASED ON SPECIFIED MARKET

CONDITIONS OR DEVELOPMENTS REGARDING THE APPLICABLE PATENT RIGHTS, INCLUDING THE OUTCOME OF OTHER GENERIC CHALLENGES TO SUCH PATENT RIGHTS. SINCE THE SETTLEMENT WITH TEVA USA AND TEVA INDUSTRIES, WYETH SETTLED PATENT SUITS AGAINST CERTAIN OTHER

GENERIC COMPANIES THAT GENERALLY GRANT LICENSES PERMITTING THE GENERIC COMPANIES TO LAUNCH GENERIC VERSIONS OF

EFFEXOR XR

IN THE U.S. ON OR AFTER JUNE 1, 2011, SUBJECT TO POSSIBLE EARLIER LAUNCH IN LIMITED CIRCUMSTANCES, BUT IN NO EVENT

EARLIER THAN JANUARY 1, 2011. SEE NOTE 19 TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS,

AND

XYNTHA

PRODUCTS INFRINGE THE PATENTS OF ANOTHER COMPANY.

WE ALSO HAVE OTHER PATENT RIGHTS COVERING ADDITIONAL PRODUCTS THAT HAVE LESSER REVENUES THAN MOST OF THE PRODUCTS SET FORTH IN THE TABLE ABOVE.

THE EXPIRATION OF A BASIC PRODUCT PATENT OR LOSS OF PATENT PROTECTION RESULTING FROM A LEGAL CHALLENGE NORMALLY RESULTS IN SIGNIFICANT COMPETITION FROM GENERIC PRODUCTS AGAINST THE ORIGINALLY PATENTED

PRODUCT AND CAN RESULT IN A SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN SALES OF THAT PRODUCT IN A VERY SHORT PERIOD. IN SOME CASES, HOWEVER, WE CAN CONTINUE TO OBTAIN COMMERCIAL BENEFITS FROM PRODUCT MANUFACTURING TRADE SECRETS; PATENTS ON USES FOR PRODUCTS; PATENTS

ON PROCESSES AND INTERMEDIATES FOR THE ECONOMICAL MANUFACTURE OF THE ACTIVE INGREDIENTS; PATENTS FOR SPECIAL FORMULATIONS OF THE PRODUCT OR DELIVERY MECHANISMS; AND CONVERSION OF THE ACTIVE INGREDIENT TO OVER-THE-COUNTER PRODUCTS.

OUR BIOTECHNOLOGY PRODUCTS, INCLUDING

ENBREL

AND

PREVNAR 7

, MAY FACE COMPETITION FROM BIOSIMILARS (ALSO REFERRED TO AS

FOLLOW-ON BIOLOGICS). SUCH BIOSIMILARS WOULD REFERENCE BIOTECHNOLOGY PRODUCTS ALREADY APPROVED UNDER THE U.S. PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICE ACT. ABBREVIATED LEGAL PATHWAYS FOR THE APPROVAL OF BIOSIMILARS EXIST IN CERTAIN INTERNATIONAL MARKETS.

IN THE U.S., THERE IS NOT CURRENTLY AN ABBREVIATED LEGAL PATHWAY TO APPROVE BIOSIMILARS; HOWEVER, LEGISLATION TO ESTABLISH SUCH A PATHWAY IS BEING CONSIDERED IN CONGRESS. ADDITIONALLY, THE FDA HAS APPROVED A BIOSIMILAR RECOMBINANT HUMAN GROWTH

HORMONE THAT REFERENCED A BIOTECHNOLOGY PRODUCT APPROVED UNDER THE U.S. FEDERAL FOOD, DRUG, AND COSMETIC ACT.

IN EUROPE, THE

EUROPEAN COMMISSION HAS GRANTED MARKETING AUTHORIZATIONS FOR SEVERAL BIOSIMILARS PURSUANT TO A SET OF GENERAL AND PRODUCT CLASS-SPECIFIC GUIDELINES FOR BIOSIMILAR APPROVALS ISSUED OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS. IF COMPETITORS ARE ABLE TO OBTAIN MARKETING

APPROVAL FOR BIOSIMILARS REFERENCING OUR BIOTECHNOLOGY PRODUCTS, OUR BIOTECHNOLOGY PRODUCTS MAY BECOME SUBJECT TO COMPETITION FROM BIOSIMILARS, WITH THE ATTENDANT COMPETITIVE PRESSURE. EXPIRATION OR SUCCESSFUL

CHALLENGE OF APPLICABLE PATENT RIGHTS COULD GENERALLY TRIGGER THIS COMPETITION, ASSUMING ANY RELEVANT DATA EXCLUSIVITY PERIOD HAS EXPIRED.

WE EXPECT THAT WE MAY FACE MORE LITIGATION WITH RESPECT TO THE VALIDITY AND/OR SCOPE OF PATENTS RELATING TO OUR BIOTECHNOLOGY PRODUCTS WITH

SUBSTANTIAL REVENUE.

ONE OF THE MAIN LIMITATIONS ON OUR OPERATIONS IN SOME COUNTRIES OUTSIDE THE U.S. IS THE LACK OF

EFFECTIVE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY PROTECTION FOR OUR PRODUCTS. UNDER INTERNATIONAL AND U.S. FREE TRADE AGREEMENTS IN RECENT YEARS, GLOBAL PROTECTION OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS HAS BEEN IMPROVING. THE WORLD TRADE ORGANIZATION AGREEMENT ON TRADE

RELATED ASPECTS OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY (WTO-TRIPS) REQUIRED PARTICIPANT COUNTRIES TO AMEND THEIR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY LAWS TO PROVIDE PATENT PROTECTION FOR PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS BY 2005 WITH AN EXTENSION UNTIL 2016 FOR LEAST-DEVELOPED NATIONS.

A NUMBER OF COUNTRIES HAVE MADE IMPROVEMENTS. WE HAVE EXPERIENCED SIGNIFICANT GROWTH IN OUR BUSINESSES IN SOME OF THOSE NATIONS, AND OUR CONTINUED BUSINESS EXPANSION IN OTHER PARTICIPANT COUNTRIES DEPENDS TO A LARGE DEGREE ON FURTHER PATENT

PROTECTION IMPROVEMENT.

COMPETITION

OUR BUSINESSES ARE CONDUCTED IN INTENSELY COMPETITIVE AND OFTEN HIGHLY REGULATED MARKETS. MANY OF OUR HUMAN PRESCRIPTION PHARMACEUTICAL

PRODUCTS FACE COMPETITION IN THE FORM OF BRANDED DRUGS OR GENERIC DRUGS THAT TREAT SIMILAR DISEASES OR INDICATIONS. THE PRINCIPAL FORMS OF COMPETITION INCLUDE EFFICACY, SAFETY, EASE OF USE, AND COST EFFECTIVENESS. THOUGH THE MEANS OF COMPETITION

VARY AMONG PRODUCT CATEGORIES AND BUSINESS GROUPS, DEMONSTRATING THE VALUE OF OUR PRODUCTS IS A CRITICAL FACTOR FOR SUCCESS IN ALL OF OUR PRINCIPAL BUSINESSES.

OUR ACQUISITION OF WYETH IN OCTOBER 2009 CREATED A BROADER, MORE DIVERSE PORTFOLIO AND PIPELINE WITH INDUSTRY-LEADING POSITIONS IN POTENTIAL HIGH-GROWTH AREAS, FURTHER STRENGTHENED BY NEW CAPABILITIES IN

BIOTECHNOLOGY AND VACCINES. THE COMBINED COMPANY NOT ONLY STRENGTHENS OUR PRESENCE IN THE UNITED STATES AND EUROPE, BUT ALSO ENHANCES OUR ABILITIES TO PROVIDE EMERGING MARKETS IN CHINA, LATIN AMERICA, AFRICA, AND THE MIDDLE EAST WITH HIGH-QUALITY,

INNOVATIVE MEDICINES.

10

TABLE OF CONTENTS

OUR COMPETITORS INCLUDE OTHER WORLDWIDE RESEARCH-BASED DRUG COMPANIES, SMALLER RESEARCH COMPANIES WITH MORE LIMITED THERAPEUTIC FOCUS, AND

GENERIC DRUG AND CONSUMER HEALTH CARE MANUFACTURERS. WE COMPETE WITH OTHER COMPANIES THAT MANUFACTURE AND SELL PRODUCTS THAT TREAT SIMILAR DISEASES OR INDICATIONS AS OUR MAJOR PRODUCTS.

SUCH COMPETITION AFFECTS OUR CORE PRODUCT BUSINESS, WHICH IS FOCUSED ON APPLYING INNOVATIVE SCIENCE TO DISCOVER AND MARKET PRODUCTS THAT

SATISFY UNMET MEDICAL NEEDS AND PROVIDE THERAPEUTIC IMPROVEMENTS. OUR EMPHASIS ON INNOVATION IS UNDERSCORED BY OUR MULTI-BILLION-DOLLAR INVESTMENT IN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, AS WELL AS OUR EMPHASIS ON BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT OVER THE PAST DECADE, ALL

RESULTING IN A STRONG PRODUCT PIPELINE. OUR INVESTMENT IN RESEARCH DOES NOT STOP WITH A DRUG APPROVAL; WE CONTINUE TO INVEST IN FURTHER UNDERSTANDING THE VALUE OF OUR PRODUCTS FOR THE CONDITIONS THEY TREAT AS WELL AS POTENTIAL NEW APPLICATIONS. WE

SEEK TO PROTECT THE HEALTH AND WELL-BEING OF PATIENTS BY ENSURING THAT MEDICALLY SOUND KNOWLEDGE OF THE BENEFITS AND RISKS OF OUR MEDICINES IS UNDERSTOOD AND COMMUNICATED TO PATIENTS, PHYSICIANS AND GLOBAL HEALTH AUTHORITIES. WE ALSO CONTINUE

TO ENHANCE THE ORGANIZATIONAL EFFECTIVENESS OF ALL OF OUR BIOPHARMACEUTICAL FUNCTIONS, INCLUDING COORDINATING SUPPORT FOR OUR SALESPEOPLES EFFORTS TO ACCURATELY AND ETHICALLY LAUNCH AND PROMOTE OUR PRODUCTS TO OUR CUSTOMERS.

OPERATING CONDITIONS HAVE BECOME MORE CHALLENGING UNDER THE MOUNTING GLOBAL PRESSURES OF COMPETITION, INDUSTRY REGULATION AND COST

CONTAINMENT. WE CONTINUE TO TAKE MEASURES TO EVALUATE, ADAPT AND IMPROVE OUR ORGANIZATION AND BUSINESS PRACTICES TO BETTER MEET CUSTOMER AND PUBLIC NEEDS. FOR INSTANCE, WE RESTRUCTURED INTO REGIONAL UNITS IN ORDER TO CREATE A MORE FLEXIBLE

ORGANIZATION EMPOWERED TO IDENTIFY AND ADDRESS LOCAL MARKET DYNAMICS AND CUSTOMER NEEDS. WE HAVE TAKEN AN INDUSTRY-LEADING ROLE IN EVOLVING OUR APPROACHES TO U.S. DIRECT-TO-CONSUMER ADVERTISING, INTERACTIONS WITH, AND PAYMENTS TO, HEALTH CARE

PROFESSIONALS AND MEDICAL EDUCATION GRANTS. WE ALSO CONTINUE TO SPONSOR PROGRAMS TO ADDRESS PATIENT AFFORDABILITY AND ACCESS BARRIERS, AS WE STRIVE TO ADVANCE FUNDAMENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM CHANGE THROUGH SUPPORT FOR BETTER HEALTH CARE SOLUTIONS.

WHILE OUR ANIMAL HEALTH UNIT IS ONE OF THE LARGEST IN THE WORLD, MANY OTHER COMPANIES OFFER

COMPETING PRODUCTS. ALTOGETHER, THERE ARE HUNDREDS OF PRODUCERS OF ANIMAL HEALTH PRODUCTS THROUGHOUT THE WORLD. THE PRINCIPAL METHODS OF COMPETITION VARY SOMEWHAT DEPENDING ON THE PARTICULAR

PRODUCT. THEY INCLUDE PRODUCT INNOVATION, QUALITY, PRICE, SERVICE AND EFFECTIVE PROMOTION TO VETERINARY PROFESSIONALS AND CONSUMERS.

OUR CONSUMER HEALTHCARE UNIT FACES COMPETITION FROM OTC BUSINESS UNITS IN OTHER MAJOR PHARMACEUTICAL AND CONSUMER PACKAGED GOODS COMPANIES AS WELL AS RETAILERS WHO CARRY THEIR OWN PRIVATE LABEL BRANDS. OUR COMPETITIVE POSITION IS AFFECTED

BY SEVERAL FACTORS, INCLUDING THE AMOUNT OF RESOURCES, RELATIVE TO COMPETITORS, DEPLOYED TO DEVELOP, ENHANCE AND PROMOTE PRODUCTS; THE EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR PROMOTIONAL EFFORTS; CUSTOMER ACCEPTANCE; PRODUCT QUALITY; NEW PRODUCT LAUNCHES; DEVELOPMENT

OF ALTERNATIVE THERAPIES BY COMPETITORS; GROWTH OF LOWER COST PRIVATE LABEL BRANDS; REGULATORY AND LEGISLATIVE ISSUES; AND SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES.

OUR NUTRITION UNIT HAS MANY COMPETITORS, INCLUDING SEVERAL MULTINATIONAL COMPANIES, AS WELL AS NUMEROUS LOCAL, PRIVATELY-OWNED BRANDS. OUR COMPETITIVE POSITION IS AFFECTED BY SEVERAL FACTORS, INCLUDING

THE AMOUNT OF RESOURCES DEPLOYED TO DEVELOP, ENHANCE AND PROMOTE PRODUCTS; THE EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR PROMOTIONAL EFFORTS; CUSTOMER ACCEPTANCE; PRODUCT QUALITY; NEW PRODUCT LAUNCHES; DEVELOPMENT OF ALTERNATIVE PRODUCTS BY COMPETITORS; GROWTH OF

LOWER-COST PRIVATE LABEL BRANDS; REGULATORY AND LEGISLATIVE ISSUES; AND SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES.

MANAGED CARE ORGANIZATIONS

THE GROWTH OF MCOS IN THE U.S. HAS BEEN A MAJOR FACTOR IN THE COMPETITIVE MAKEUP OF THE HEALTH CARE MARKETPLACE.

APPROXIMATELY 250 MILLION PEOPLE IN THE U.S. NOW PARTICIPATE IN SOME VERSION OF MANAGED CARE. BECAUSE OF THE SIZE OF THE PATIENT POPULATION COVERED BY MCOS, THE MARKETING OF PRESCRIPTION DRUGS TO THEM AND THE PBMS THAT SERVE MANY OF THOSE

ORGANIZATIONS CONTINUES TO GROW IN IMPORTANCE.

MCOS CAN INCLUDE MEDICAL INSURANCE COMPANIES, MEDICAL PLAN ADMINISTRATORS,

HEALTH MAINTENANCE ORGANIZATIONS, ALLIANCES OF HOSPITALS AND PHYSICIANS AND OTHER PHYSICIAN ORGANIZATIONS. THE PURCHASING POWER OF MCOS HAS INCREASED IN RECENT

11

TABLE OF CONTENTS

YEARS DUE TO THE GROWING NUMBERS OF PATIENTS ENROLLED IN MCOS. AT THE SAME TIME, THOSE ORGANIZATIONS HAVE BEEN CONSOLIDATING INTO FEWER, EVEN LARGER ENTITIES. THIS CONSOLIDATION ENHANCES THEIR

PURCHASING STRENGTH AND IMPORTANCE TO US.

THE GROWTH OF MCOS HAS INCREASED PRESSURE ON DRUG PRICES. ONE OBJECTIVE OF MCOS IS

TO CONTAIN AND, WHERE POSSIBLE, REDUCE HEALTH CARE EXPENDITURES. THEY TYPICALLY USE FORMULARIES, VOLUME PURCHASES AND LONG-TERM CONTRACTS TO NEGOTIATE DISCOUNTS FROM PHARMACEUTICAL PROVIDERS. THEY USE THEIR PURCHASING POWER TO BARGAIN FOR LOWER

SUPPLIER PRICES. THEY ALSO EMPHASIZE PRIMARY AND PREVENTIVE CARE, OUT-PATIENT TREATMENT AND PROCEDURES PERFORMED AT DOCTORS OFFICES AND CLINICS. HOSPITALIZATION AND SURGERY, TYPICALLY THE MOST EXPENSIVE FORMS OF TREATMENT, ARE CAREFULLY

MANAGED. SINCE THE USE OF CERTAIN DRUGS CAN PREVENT THE NEED FOR HOSPITALIZATION, PROFESSIONAL THERAPY OR EVEN SURGERY, SUCH DRUGS CAN BECOME FAVORED FIRST-LINE TREATMENTS FOR CERTAIN DISEASES.

AS DISCUSSED ABOVE IN

MARKETING

, MCOS AND PBMS TYPICALLY DEVELOP FORMULARIES. FORMULARIES CAN BE BASED ON THE PRICES AND THERAPEUTIC

BENEFITS OF THE AVAILABLE PRODUCTS. DUE TO THEIR GENERALLY LOWER COST, GENERIC MEDICINES ARE OFTEN FAVORED. THE BREADTH OF THE PRODUCTS COVERED BY FORMULARIES CAN VARY CONSIDERABLY FROM ONE MCO TO ANOTHER AND MANY FORMULARIES INCLUDE ALTERNATIVE AND

COMPETITIVE PRODUCTS FOR TREATMENT OF PARTICULAR MEDICAL PROBLEMS. MCOS USE A VARIETY OF MEANS TO ENCOURAGE PATIENTS USE OF PRODUCTS LISTED ON THEIR FORMULARIES.

EXCLUSION OF A PRODUCT FROM A FORMULARY OR OTHER RESTRICTIONS, SUCH AS REQUIRING PRIOR AUTHORIZATIONS, CAN LEAD TO ITS SHARPLY REDUCED USAGE IN THE MCO PATIENT POPULATION. CONSEQUENTLY, PHARMACEUTICAL

COMPANIES COMPETE AGGRESSIVELY TO HAVE THEIR PRODUCTS INCLUDED. WHERE POSSIBLE, COMPANIES COMPETE FOR INCLUSION BASED UPON UNIQUE FEATURES OF THEIR PRODUCTS, SUCH AS GREATER EFFICACY, BETTER PATIENT EASE OF USE OR FEWER SIDE EFFECTS. A LOWER OVERALL

COST OF THERAPY IS ALSO AN IMPORTANT FACTOR. PRODUCTS THAT DEMONSTRATE FEWER THERAPEUTIC ADVANTAGES MUST COMPETE FOR INCLUSION BASED PRIMARILY ON PRICE. WE HAVE BEEN GENERALLY, ALTHOUGH NOT UNIVERSALLY, SUCCESSFUL IN HAVING OUR MAJOR PRODUCTS

INCLUDED ON MOST MCO FORMULARIES.

THE IMPACT OF MCOS ON DRUG PRICES AND VOLUMES HAS INCREASED AS THE RESULT OF THEIR ROLE IN

NEGOTIATING ON BEHALF OF MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES IN CONNECTION WITH THE MEDICARE OUT-PATIENT PRESCRIPTION DRUG BENEFIT, MEDICARE PART D, THAT TOOK EFFECT JANUARY 1, 2006. MCOS AND PBMS

NEGOTIATE ON BEHALF OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AS PRESCRIPTION DRUG PLANS (PDPS). WE HAVE BEEN GENERALLY, ALTHOUGH NOT UNIVERSALLY, SUCCESSFUL IN HAVING OUR MAJOR PRODUCTS THAT ARE USED BY THE SENIOR POPULATION INCLUDED ON THE FORMULARIES OF THE NEW

MEDICARE PDPS FOR 2009.

GENERIC PRODUCTS

ONE OF THE BIGGEST COMPETITIVE CHALLENGES THAT WE FACE IS FROM GENERIC PHARMACEUTICAL MANUFACTURERS. UPON THE EXPIRATION OR LOSS OF PATENT PROTECTION FOR A PRODUCT, ESPECIALLY A SMALL MOLECULE PRODUCT, WE

CAN LOSE THE MAJOR PORTION OF SALES OF THAT PRODUCT IN A VERY SHORT PERIOD. SEVERAL SUCH COMPETITORS MAKE A REGULAR PRACTICE OF CHALLENGING OUR PRODUCT PATENTS BEFORE THEIR EXPIRY. GENERIC COMPETITORS OPERATE WITHOUT OUR LARGE RESEARCH AND

DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES AND OUR COSTS OF CONVEYING MEDICAL INFORMATION ABOUT OUR PRODUCTS TO THE MEDICAL COMMUNITY. IN ADDITION, THE FDA APPROVAL PROCESS EXEMPTS GENERICS FROM COSTLY AND TIME-CONSUMING CLINICAL TRIALS TO DEMONSTRATE THEIR SAFETY AND

EFFICACY, ALLOWING GENERIC MANUFACTURERS TO RELY ON THE SAFETY AND EFFICACY DATA OF THE INNOVATOR PRODUCT. GENERIC PRODUCTS NEED ONLY DEMONSTRATE A LEVEL OF AVAILABILITY IN THE BLOODSTREAM EQUIVALENT TO THAT OF THE INNOVATOR PRODUCT. THIS MEANS THAT

GENERIC COMPETITORS CAN MARKET A COMPETING VERSION OF OUR PRODUCT AFTER THE EXPIRATION OR LOSS OF OUR PATENT AND CHARGE MUCH LESS.

IN ADDITION, OUR PATENT-PROTECTED PRODUCTS CAN FACE COMPETITION IN THE FORM OF GENERIC VERSIONS OF BRANDED PRODUCTS OF COMPETITORS THAT LOSE THEIR MARKET EXCLUSIVITY. FOR EXAMPLE,

LIPITOR

BEGAN TO FACE COMPETITION FROM GENERIC

PRAVASTATIN (PRAVACHOL) AND GENERIC SIMVASTATIN (ZOCOR) DURING 2006.

AS NOTED ABOVE, MCOS THAT FOCUS PRIMARILY ON THE

IMMEDIATE COST OF DRUGS OFTEN FAVOR GENERICS OVER BRAND-NAME DRUGS. MANY GOVERNMENTS ALSO ENCOURAGE THE USE OF GENERICS AS ALTERNATIVES TO BRAND-NAME DRUGS IN THEIR HEALTH CARE PROGRAMS, INCLUDING MEDICAID IN THE U.S. LAWS IN THE U.S. GENERALLY

ALLOW, AND IN SOME CASES REQUIRE, PHARMACISTS TO SUBSTITUTE GENERIC DRUGS THAT HAVE BEEN RATED UNDER GOVERNMENT PROCEDURES TO BE THERAPEUTICALLY EQUIVALENT TO BRAND-NAME DRUGS. THE

SUBSTITUTION MUST BE MADE UNLESS THE PRESCRIBING PHYSICIAN EXPRESSLY FORBIDS IT. IN THE U.S., PFIZERS GREENSTONE SUBSIDIARY SELLS GENERIC VERSIONS OF PFIZERS AS WELL AS CERTAIN OF OUR

COMPETITORS PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS UPON LOSS OF EXCLUSIVITY, AS APPROPRIATE.

RAW MATERIALS

RAW MATERIALS ESSENTIAL TO OUR BUSINESSES ARE PURCHASED WORLDWIDE IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS FROM NUMEROUS

SUPPLIERS. IN GENERAL, THESE MATERIALS ARE AVAILABLE FROM MULTIPLE SOURCES. NO SERIOUS SHORTAGES OR DELAYS WERE ENCOUNTERED IN 2009, AND NONE ARE EXPECTED IN 2010. HOWEVER, SELECT AGRICULTURAL-BASED MATERIALS HAVE FROM TIME TO TIME INCREASED IN

PRICE DUE TO SHORT-TERM IMBALANCES BETWEEN SUPPLY AND DEMAND. WE HAVE SUCCESSFULLY SECURED THESE MATERIALS TO MEET OUR REQUIREMENTS IN THESE CIRCUMSTANCES BUT GENERALLY AT HIGHER PRICES THAN THOSE HISTORICALLY PAID.

GOVERNMENT REGULATION AND PRICE CONSTRAINTS

IN THE UNITED STATES

GENERAL.

PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES ARE SUBJECT

TO EXTENSIVE REGULATION BY NATIONAL, STATE AND LOCAL AGENCIES IN THE COUNTRIES IN WHICH THEY DO BUSINESS. OF PARTICULAR IMPORTANCE IS THE FDA IN THE U.S. IT HAS JURISDICTION OVER OUR BIOPHARMACEUTICAL SEGMENT AND ADMINISTERS REQUIREMENTS COVERING

THE TESTING, SAFETY, EFFECTIVENESS, MANUFACTURING, LABELING, MARKETING, ADVERTISING AND POST-MARKETING SURVEILLANCE OF OUR BIOPHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS. THE FDA ALSO REGULATES OUR CONSUMER HEALTHCARE, NUTRITION AND CAPSUGEL PRODUCTS AS WELL AS OUR

ANIMAL HEALTH PRODUCTS. THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE AND THE U.S. ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY ALSO REGULATE SOME OF OUR PRODUCTS.

IN ADDITION, MANY OF OUR ACTIVITIES ARE SUBJECT TO THE JURISDICTION OF VARIOUS OTHER FEDERAL REGULATORY AND ENFORCEMENT DEPARTMENTS AND AGENCIES, SUCH AS THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES (HHS),

THE FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION (WHICH ALSO HAS THE AUTHORITY TO REGULATE THE ADVERTISING OF CONSUMER HEALTH CARE PRODUCTS INCLUDING OVER-THE-COUNTER DRUGS AND DIETARY SUPPLEMENTS) AND THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE. INDIVIDUAL STATES, ACTING THROUGH THEIR

ATTORNEYS GENERAL, HAVE BECOME ACTIVE AS WELL, SEEKING TO REGULATE THE MARKETING OF PRESCRIPTION DRUGS UNDER STATE CONSUMER PROTECTION

AND FALSE ADVERTISING LAWS. WE ARE SUBJECT TO POSSIBLE ADMINISTRATIVE AND LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND ACTIONS BY THESE VARIOUS REGULATORY BODIES (SEE NOTE 19 TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS,

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND CONTINGENCIES,

IN OUR 2009 FINANCIAL REPORT). SUCH ACTIONS MAY INCLUDE PRODUCT RECALLS, SEIZURES AND OTHER CIVIL AND CRIMINAL SANCTIONS.

THE U.S. CONGRESS AND THE FDA ARE CONSIDERING PROPOSALS TO CLARIFY HOW THE FDA ASSESSES FOLLOW-ON BIOLOGICAL PRODUCTS. DEPENDING ON THE SPECIFIC PROVISIONS, LEGISLATIVE OR REGULATORY CHANGES

THAT WOULD FACILITATE THE APPROVAL OF SUCH PRODUCTS COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR BUSINESS.

MEDICARE.

IN

DECEMBER 2003, THE MEDICARE PRESCRIPTION DRUG, IMPROVEMENT, AND MODERNIZATION ACT OF 2003 (THE 2003 MEDICARE MODERNIZATION ACT) WAS ENACTED. MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES ARE NOW ELIGIBLE TO OBTAIN SUBSIDIZED PRESCRIPTION DRUG COVERAGE FROM A CHOICE OF

PRIVATE SECTOR PLANS. APPROXIMATELY 90% OF MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES NOW HAVE COVERAGE FOR PRESCRIPTION MEDICINES WITH HIGH LEVELS OF BENEFICIARY SATISFACTION AND LOWER-THAN-EXPECTED COSTS TO THE GOVERNMENT AND TO BENEFICIARIES. THE USE OF

PHARMACEUTICALS HAS INCREASED SLIGHTLY AMONG SOME PATIENTS AS THE RESULT OF THE EXPANDED ACCESS TO MEDICINES AFFORDED BY COVERAGE UNDER MEDICARE. HOWEVER, SUCH EXPANDED UTILIZATION HAS BEEN LARGELY OFFSET BY INCREASED PRICING PRESSURE AND

COMPETITION DUE TO THE ENHANCED PURCHASING POWER OF THE PRIVATE SECTOR PLANS THAT NEGOTIATE ON BEHALF OF MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES AND BY AN INCREASE IN THE USE OF GENERIC MEDICINES IN THIS POPULATION. DESPITE THE SUCCESS OF MEDICARE PART D,

LEGISLATIVE CHANGES HAVE BEEN PROPOSED TO MANDATE GOVERNMENT REBATES IN MEDICARE AND TO ALLOW THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO DIRECTLY NEGOTIATE PRICES WITH PHARMACEUTICAL MANUFACTURERS. IT IS EXPECTED THAT IF LEGISLATION WERE ENACTED TO MANDATE REBATES

OR PROVIDE FOR DIRECT GOVERNMENT NEGOTIATION IN MEDICARE PART D, ACCESS AND REIMBURSEMENT FOR OUR PRODUCTS WOULD BE RESTRICTED.

PFIZER IS COMMITTED TO HELPING ENSURE THAT ALL AMERICANS WITHOUT COVERAGE FOR PRESCRIPTION MEDICINES HAVE ACCESS TO PFIZER PRODUCTS. TO THAT END, IN 2004, WE IMPLEMENTED OUR HELPFUL ANSWERS PROGRAM, AN UMBRELLA PROGRAM THAT BRINGS TOGETHER

PFIZERS LONG-STANDING PATIENT ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS WITH PFIZER PFRIENDS, A PRESCRIPTION DISCOUNT CARD OFFERING SAVINGS ON PFIZER PRESCRIPTION MEDICINES FOR ALL AMERICANS WITHOUT PRESCRIPTION DRUG COVERAGE,

13

TABLE OF CONTENTS

REGARDLESS OF AGE OR INCOME. IN ADDITION, IN JANUARY 2005, WE JOINED TOGETHER RX ACCESS WITH NINE OTHER PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES TO OFFER SAVINGS ON OVER 275 MEDICINES TO MEDICARE-INELIGIBLE,

UNINSURED INDIVIDUALS UNDER 65 WHO FALL BELOW CERTAIN INCOME THRESHOLDS. PFIZER ALSO PARTICIPATES IN THE PARTNERSHIP FOR PRESCRIPTION ASSISTANCE, A SINGLE POINT OF ACCESS TO MORE THAN 475 PUBLIC AND PRIVATE PATIENT ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS. MORE

RECENTLY, THE PFIZER MAINTAIN PROGRAM (MEDICINES ASSISTANCE FOR THOSE WHO ARE IN NEED) PROVIDES DELIVERY OF FREE PFIZER MEDICINES TO THE HOMES OF QUALIFIED PATIENTS. THIS PROGRAM IS INTENDED TO PROVIDE PFIZER MEDICINES TO PATIENTS WHO HAVE RECENTLY

BECOME UNEMPLOYED AND ARE UNINSURED.

IF FEDERAL HEALTH CARE REFORM PROPOSALS (SEE

RISK FACTORS

FOR A DISCUSSION OF THE

POTENTIAL RISKS HEALTH CARE REFORM MAY HAVE ON OUR BUSINESS) CURRENTLY BEFORE THE CONGRESS ARE PASSED, THERE MAY BE CHANGES TO THE EXISTING MEDICARE PART D. SUCH CHANGES MAY INCLUDE A REQUIREMENT FOR PHARMACEUTICAL MANUFACTURERS TO PAY A PORTION OF

THE COST OF MEDICATIONS WHEN PATIENTS REACH THE CURRENT COVERAGE GAP. SEE

HEALTH CARE REFORM

BELOW. THIS COST OFFSET IS EXPECTED TO BE PASSED ON TO PATIENTS PURCHASING THEIR MEDICATIONS AT PHARMACIES. WHILE THE DECREASE IN PATIENT COSTS WILL

ASSIST PATIENTS IN AFFORDING THEIR MEDICATIONS, IT WILL ALSO REDUCE REVENUES FOR THE MEDICATIONS SOLD DURING THIS COVERAGE GAP.

IMPORTATION OF DRUGS.

THERE CONTINUE TO BE LEGISLATIVE PROPOSALS TO AMEND U.S. LAW TO ALLOW THE IMPORTATION INTO THE U.S. OF PRESCRIPTION DRUGS FROM OUTSIDE THE U.S., WHICH CAN BE SOLD AT PRICES THAT ARE REGULATED BY THE GOVERNMENTS

OF VARIOUS FOREIGN COUNTRIES. IN ADDITION TO WELL-DOCUMENTED SAFETY CONCERNS, SUCH IMPORTATION COULD IMPACT PHARMACEUTICAL PRICES IN THE U.S. WHILE THE 2003 MEDICARE MODERNIZATION ACT MAINTAINS A PROHIBITION ON SUCH IMPORTS, IT WOULD ALLOW

IMPORTATION FROM CANADA IF THE SECRETARY OF HHS CERTIFIES THAT SUCH IMPORTATION IS SAFE AND WOULD RESULT IN SAVINGS TO CONSUMERS. BEFORE THE 2003 MEDICARE MODERNIZATION ACT, FEDERAL LAW WOULD HAVE PERMITTED IMPORTATION OF MEDICINES INTO THE U.S.

FROM A CONSIDERABLY LARGER GROUP OF DEVELOPED COUNTRIES, PROVIDED THE SECRETARY OF HHS MADE THE SAME SAFETY AND COST-SAVINGS CERTIFICATIONS.

THE SECRETARIES OF HHS IN BOTH THE CLINTON AND GEORGE W. BUSH ADMINISTRATIONS DECLINED TO CERTIFY THAT IMPORTATION OF MEDICINES IS SAFE AND SAVES

MONEY. IF THE CURRENT SECRETARY OF HHS WERE TO CERTIFY THAT IMPORTATION IS SAFE AND SAVES MONEY, AN INCREASE IN CROSS-BORDER TRADE IN MEDICINES SUBJECT TO FOREIGN PRICE CONTROLS IN OTHER

COUNTRIES COULD OCCUR AND COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR BUSINESS.

IN DECEMBER 2004, HHS AND THE DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE

ISSUED REPORTS ON DRUG IMPORTATION AND FOREIGN PRICE CONTROLS. THE HHS REPORT NOTED THAT IT WOULD BE EXTRAORDINARILY DIFFICULT TO ENSURE THAT DRUGS PERSONALLY IMPORTED BY INDIVIDUAL CONSUMERS COULD MEET THE STANDARDS OF SAFETY THAT WOULD

SUPPORT CERTIFYING SUCH IMPORTATION AS SAFE. WHILE THE REPORT ALSO CONCLUDED THAT THE U.S. COULD ESTABLISH A FEASIBLE BASIS FOR COMMERCIAL DRUG IMPORTATION, SUCH A CHANGE IN THE LAW WOULD REQUIRE NEW LEGAL AUTHORITIES, SUBSTANTIAL ADDITIONAL

RESOURCES AND SIGNIFICANT RESTRICTIONS ON THE TYPES OF DRUGS THAT COULD BE IMPORTED. THE REPORT ALSO NOTED THAT THE TOTAL SAVINGS TO BE EXPECTED FROM SUCH A COMMERCIAL IMPORTATION REGIME WOULD BE RELATIVELY SMALL1% OR 2% OF TOTAL DRUG

SPENDING IN THE U.S. THE COMMERCE DEPARTMENT REPORT CONFIRMED THAT THE LOWER PRICES IN MANY COUNTRIES RESULT FROM GOVERNMENTAL PRICE CONTROLS, AND THESE PRICE CONTROLS ADVERSELY AFFECT THE AMOUNT OF FUNDING THAT IS AVAILABLE FOR THE DISCOVERY OF NEW

DRUGS. RAND HEALTH, A DIVISION OF THE RAND CORPORATION, RELEASED A STUDY IN DECEMBER 2008 SHOWING THAT PRICE CONTROLS IN THE U.S. WOULD HAVE A SIGNIFICANT NEGATIVE IMPACT ON HEALTH IN BOTH THE U.S. AND ABROAD BY DETERRING THE INVESTMENT THAT LEADS

TO THE DISCOVERY OF NEW MEDICINES.

MEDICAID AND RELATED MATTERS.

FEDERAL LAW REQUIRES US TO GIVE REBATES TO STATE

MEDICAID AGENCIES BASED ON EACH STATES REIMBURSEMENT OF PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS UNDER THE MEDICAID PROGRAM. IN RECENT YEARS, VARIOUS PROPOSALS HAVE BEEN OFFERED AT FEDERAL AND STATE LEVELS THAT WOULD BRING ABOUT MAJOR CHANGES IN THE MEDICAID

PROGRAM. IN THE SHORT TERM, DRIVEN BY BUDGET CONCERNS, MANY STATES HAVE IMPLEMENTED RESTRICTIVE DRUG LISTS AND STATE SUPPLEMENTAL REBATE PROGRAMS UNDER THE MEDICAID PROGRAM. THE DOWNTURN IN STATE REVENUES, COUPLED WITH AN ANTICIPATED INCREASE IN

MEDICAID PROGRAM ENROLLMENT DUE TO A DECLINING ECONOMY, COULD CAUSE REBATE PAYMENTS TO RISE IN 2010. SHOULD CONGRESS PASS FEDERAL HEALTH CARE REFORM PROPOSALS CURRENTLY BEFORE THE CONGRESS, AN INCREASE IN PHARMACEUTICAL REBATES PAID TO THE PROGRAM

IS ANTICIPATED. THE INCREASE WOULD MOST LIKELY BE THE RESULT OF AN INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS

14

TABLE OF CONTENTS

ELIGIBLE FOR THE MEDICAID PROGRAM, AN EXPANSION OF ENTITIES ELIGIBLE FOR THE MEDICAID REBATE (SUCH AS MEDICAID MANAGED CARE PROGRAMS) AND AN INCREASE IN THE MINIMUM REBATE REQUIRED FOR

PARTICIPATION IN THE PROGRAM. THE ANTICIPATED INCREASE IN THE MINIMUM REBATE MAY ALSO HAVE IMPLICATIONS FOR THE FEDERAL 340B PROGRAM THAT REQUIRES THE OFFERING OF DISCOUNTS BASED AT A MINIMUM TO THE REBATES PAID IN THE MEDICAID PROGRAM. AN EXPANSION

OF ENTITIES THAT MAY BECOME ELIGIBLE FOR ACCESS TO DISCOUNTS OFFERED THROUGH THE 340B PROGRAM MAY ALSO INCREASE THE DISCOUNTS THAT ARE REQUIRED.

THE MAJORITY OF STATES USE PREFERRED DRUG LISTS TO RESTRICT MEDICAID BENEFICIARIES ACCESS TO CERTAIN MEDICINES. RESTRICTIONS EXIST FOR SOME PFIZER PRODUCTS IN CERTAIN STATES. ACCESS IN THE MEDICAID

MANAGED CARE PROGRAM IS TYPICALLY DETERMINED BY THE HEALTH PLANS PROVIDING COVERAGE FOR MEDICAID RECIPIENTS CONTRACTING FOR THE PROVISION OF SERVICES IN THE STATE. ACCESS MAY VARY BY PLAN. HOWEVER, THERE HAVE BEEN LEGISLATIVE PROPOSALS TO APPLY

GOVERNMENT MANDATED MEDICAID REBATES TO THE MEDICAID MANAGED CARE PROGRAM.

EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2007, CHANGES TO THE

TREATMENT OF AUTHORIZED GENERICS FOR PURPOSES OF CALCULATING MEDICAID REBATES INCREASED THE AMOUNT OF REBATES WE ARE REQUIRED TO PAY ON BRAND NAME DRUG SALES AFTER LOSS OF EXCLUSIVITY AND ON AUTHORIZED GENERIC SALES TO THE MEDICAID PROGRAM. IN AN

EFFORT TO INCREASE COVERAGE OF THE LOW INCOME UNINSURED, A NUMBER OF STATES ARE ALSO CONSIDERING EXPANSION OF ELIGIBILITY FOR THEIR MEDICAID PROGRAMS THAT WOULD RESULT IN INCREASED EXPOSURE TO MEDICAID REBATES, THOUGH MOSTLY TO POPULATIONS THAT

CURRENTLY DO NOT HAVE PRESCRIPTION DRUG COVERAGE.

SOME STATES ARE CONSIDERING PRICE-CONTROL REGIMES THAT WOULD APPLY TO

BROADER SEGMENTS OF THEIR POPULATIONS THAT ARE NOT MEDICAID ELIGIBLE.

IF MANY STATES WERE TO REQUIRE INCREASED REBATE

PAYMENTS IN DISCOUNT PROGRAMS FOR THE UNINSURED AND LINK MEDICAID BENEFICIARIES ACCESS TO OUR PRODUCTS TO SUCH DISCOUNT PROGRAMS, THE IMPACT ON PATIENTS ACCESS TO MEDICINES AND ON PFIZER COULD BE SIGNIFICANT.

WE ALSO MUST GIVE DISCOUNTS OR REBATES ON PURCHASES OR REIMBURSEMENTS OF PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS BY CERTAIN OTHER FEDERAL AND STATE AGENCIES

AND PROGRAMS. SEE THE DISCUSSION REGARDING REBATES IN

THE

REVENUES

SECTION OF OUR 2009 FINANCIAL REPORT AND IN NOTE 1-H TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS,

SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES, REVENUES,

IN OUR 2009 FINANCIAL REPORT,

WHICH DISCUSSIONS ARE INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE.

MARKETING RESTRICTIONS

. A NUMBER OF STATES ARE CONSIDERING PROGRAMS

TO CONTROL PHARMACEUTICAL MARKETING ACTIVITIES THAT GO BEYOND COMMITMENTS MADE RELATED TO ADHERING TO THE RECENTLY REVISED AND STRENGTHENED PHRMA CODE FOR INTERACTIONS WITH HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONALS. IF IMPLEMENTED, SUCH EFFORTS HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO

LIMIT APPROPRIATE COMMUNICATION ACTIVITIES WITH HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS PRESCRIBING OUR MEDICATIONS.

HEALTH CARE REFORM.

WE CONTINUE TO BE A CONSTRUCTIVE FORCE IN HELPING TO SHAPE HEALTH CARE POLICY AND REGULATION OF OUR PRODUCTS. ALTHOUGH WE CANNOT PREDICT THE OUTCOME OF PENDING AND POSSIBLE FUTURE U.S. HEALTH CARE REFORM INITIATIVES, WE REMAIN COMMITTED AND

ACTIVELY ENGAGED IN DISCUSSIONS TO REFORM HEALTH CARE IN A WAY THAT EXPANDS COVERAGE FOR THOSE CURRENTLY UNINSURED, DOES NOT ERODE COVERAGE FOR THOSE CURRENTLY INSURED, IMPROVES QUALITY, REWARDS INNOVATION AND PROVIDES VALUE FOR PATIENTS. DURING THE

SECOND QUARTER OF 2009, PHRMA, OF WHICH WE ARE A MEMBER, ANNOUNCED AN $80 BILLION COMMITMENT OVER THE NEXT DECADE TO SUPPORT HEALTH CARE REFORM IN THE U.S. AMONG OTHER THINGS, THAT COMMITMENT INCLUDES REDUCING THE COST OF MEDICINES FOR SENIORS AND

DISABLED AMERICANS WHO ARE AFFECTED BY THE COVERAGE GAP IN THE MEDICARE PRESCRIPTION DRUG PROGRAM. THE PHRMA COMMITMENT IS INTENDED TO BE PART OF ANY FEDERAL HEALTH CARE REFORM LEGISLATION IN THE U.S.

OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES

WE ENCOUNTER SIMILAR REGULATORY AND LEGISLATIVE ISSUES IN MOST OTHER COUNTRIES. IN EUROPE, CANADA AND SOME OTHER INTERNATIONAL MARKETS, THE GOVERNMENT PROVIDES HEALTH CARE AT LOW DIRECT COST TO CONSUMERS AND REGULATES PHARMACEUTICAL PRICES

OR PATIENT REIMBURSEMENT LEVELS TO CONTROL COSTS FOR THE GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED HEALTH CARE SYSTEM. THIS INTERNATIONAL PATCHWORK OF PRICE REGULATION HAS LED TO DIFFERENT PRICES AND SOME THIRD-PARTY TRADE IN OUR PRODUCTS FROM MARKETS WITH LOWER PRICES.

SUCH TRADE EXPLOITING PRICE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN COUNTRIES CAN UNDERMINE OUR SALES IN MARKETS WITH HIGHER PRICES.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE APPROVAL OF NEW DRUGS ACROSS THE EUROPEAN UNION (EU) MAY ONLY BE ACHIEVED USING THE MUTUAL RECOGNITION PROCEDURE/DECENTRALIZED PROCEDURE OR

EU COMMISSION/EUROPEAN MEDICINES AGENCY (EMA) CENTRAL APPROVAL PROCESS, WHICH APPLIES IN THE EU MEMBER STATES, PLUS NORWAY AND ICELAND, WHICH ARE FULL PARTICIPANTS IN THESE REGISTRATION PROCESSES. THE USE OF THESE PROCEDURES PROVIDES A MORE RAPID

AND CONSISTENT APPROVAL PROCESS ACROSS THE MEMBER STATES THAN WAS THE CASE WHEN THE APPROVAL PROCESSES WERE OPERATING INDEPENDENTLY WITHIN EACH COUNTRY.

SINCE THE EU DOES NOT HAVE JURISDICTION OVER PATIENT REIMBURSEMENT OR PRICING MATTERS IN ITS MEMBER STATES, WE CONTINUE TO WORK WITH INDIVIDUAL COUNTRIES ON SUCH MATTERS ACROSS THE REGION.

DURING 2004, A COMPREHENSIVE PACKAGE OF REFORMS WAS ADOPTED AMENDING EU LAW ON THE REGULATION OF MEDICINAL PRODUCTS IN MANY AREAS, INCLUDING

APPROVAL PROCEDURES AND SAFETY REPORTING. OF PARTICULAR NOTE, THE DATA EXCLUSIVITY PERIODS DURING WHICH INNOVATIVE COMPANIES REGULATORY DATA ARE PROTECTED ARE REQUIRED TO BE HARMONIZED IN ALL MEMBER STATES. IN ADDITION, THESE REFORMS

INTRODUCED A CLEAR LEGAL BASIS FOR THE APPROVAL OF BIOSIMILAR OR FOLLOW-ON BIOLOGICAL PRODUCTS IN THE EU. FOLLOWING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THESE NEW REGULATIONS (IN NOVEMBER 2005), THE FIRST SUCH PRODUCTS, INCLUDING A BIOSIMILAR VERSION OF

GENOTROPIN

, WERE APPROVED IN THE EU IN 2006. THE NEW REGULATIONS ALSO SHORTENED CERTAIN APPROVAL TIMELINES AND INTRODUCED FAST-TRACK AND CONDITIONAL CENTRALIZED AUTHORIZATIONS. PFIZERS

SUTENT

WAS THE FIRST PRODUCT TO BE

CONDITIONALLY APPROVED UNDER THE NEW LAW IN 2006 (ALTHOUGH ITS STATUS SUBSEQUENTLY WAS CONVERTED TO FULL AUTHORIZATION). AT PRESENT, A NEW REFORM PROPOSAL IS PENDING IN THE EU, WHICH WOULD INTRODUCE CHANGES TO ADDRESS THE PROBLEM OF COUNTERFEIT

MEDICINES AND TO MAKE IMPROVEMENTS TO THE PHARMACOVIGILANCE SYSTEM. THIS PROPOSAL ALSO INCLUDES CHANGES TO ALLOW PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES TO PROVIDE CERTAIN NON-PROMOTIONAL INFORMATION ON THEIR MEDICINES TO THE PUBLIC; HOWEVER, THIS HAS PROVED

PARTICULARLY CONTENTIOUS AND AS SUCH IS EXPECTED TO BE DEALT WITH SEPARATELY.

ON JANUARY 26, 2007, THE NEW EU REGULATION

ON MEDICINES FOR PEDIATRIC USE BECAME EFFECTIVE. THIS INTRODUCED NEW OBLIGATIONS ON PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES TO CONDUCT RESEARCH ON THEIR MEDICINES FOR CHILDREN AND, SUBJECT TO VARIOUS CONDITIONS, OFFERED

THE POSSIBILITY OF INCENTIVES FOR SO DOING, INCLUDING EXCLUSIVITY EXTENSIONS. THE AIM OF THIS REGULATION IS TO IMPROVE THE HEALTH OF CHILDREN IN THE EU THROUGH HIGH QUALITY RESEARCH, STIMULATING

THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW MEDICINES, CREATING INFRASTRUCTURE TO ENABLE AUTHORIZED USE AND IMPROVING THE INFORMATION ON MEDICINES FOR CHILDREN. A PEDIATRIC COMMITTEE (PDCO) WAS CREATED WITHIN THE EMA TO PROVIDE SCIENTIFIC OPINIONS AND INPUT ON

DEVELOPMENT PLANS FOR MEDICINES FOR USE WITH CHILDREN. IN LINE WITH THIS REGULATION, PFIZER IS CONDUCTING MANY PEDIATRIC RESEARCH PROGRAMS FOR ITS IN-LINE AND DEVELOPMENT PRODUCTS, AND COMPLETED ITS FIRST EMA-APPROVED PEDIATRIC INVESTIGATION PLAN

(FOR

LIPITOR

) IN 2009.

ON NOVEMBER 28, 2007, THE EU COMMISSION HOSTED THE TRANSATLANTIC ADMINISTRATIVE

SIMPLIFICATION WORKSHOP CO-CHAIRED BY THE EU COMMISSION AND THE FDA, IN CO-OPERATION WITH THE EMA AND THE HEADS OF EUROPEAN MEDICINES AGENCIES, TO IDENTIFY OPPORTUNITIES FOR ADMINISTRATIVE SIMPLIFICATION BETWEEN THE U.S. AND THE EU IN THE FIELD OF

PHARMACEUTICAL REGULATION. THESE OPPORTUNITIES INCLUDED POSSIBLE HARMONIZATION OF ADMINISTRATIVE PRACTICES AND GUIDELINES, NOT NECESSITATING CHANGES IN REGULATIONS, WHILE MAINTAINING OR INCREASING THE CURRENT LEVELS OF PUBLIC HEALTH PROTECTION. BY

FREEING UP RESOURCES, THIS COOPERATION WILL ALLOW THE INDUSTRY TO FOCUS MORE OF ITS RESOURCES ON DEVELOPING AND SUPPLYING MEDICINES TO MEET THE NEEDS OF PATIENTS. DURING THE ANNUAL EU - EMA/FDA BILATERAL MEETING IN SEPTEMBER 2009, THE

PARTIES PROVIDED AN UPDATE ON THE STATUS OF THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE SIMPLIFICATION PROJECT. THESE EFFORTS ARE CONTINUING AND INTER-AGENCY DIALOGUE IS EXPANDING INTO A RANGE OF AREAS, SUCH AS PEDIATRIC DEVELOPMENT.

HEALTH CANADA IS THE GOVERNMENT AGENCY THAT PROVIDES REGULATORY AND MARKETING APPROVAL FOR DRUGS AND THERAPEUTIC PRODUCTS IN CANADA. IN

OCTOBER 2006, HEALTH CANADA INTRODUCED ITS MODERNIZATION INITIATIVE UNDER THE

BLUEPRINT FOR RENEWAL: MODERNIZING CANADAS REGULATORY SYSTEM FOR HEALTH PRODUCTS AND FOOD

POLICY FRAMEWORK. THE

BLUEPRINT

INCLUDES TEN OBJECTIVES AMONG

WHICH ARE: THE PROGRESSIVE LICENSING FRAMEWORK (PLF) NOW REFERRED TO AS THE LEGISLATIVE AND REGULATORY MODERNIZATION (LRM) FOR PHARMACEUTICALS AND BIOLOGICS; ADOPTION OF A PRODUCT LIFE-CYCLE APPROACH TO REGULATIONS; STRONGER POST-MARKET SAFETY AND

SURVEILLANCE SYSTEMS; INCREASED TRANSPARENCY AND OPENNESS; EMPHASIS ON SPECIAL

TABLE OF CONTENTS

POPULATIONS (INCLUDING THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE EXPERT ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON PEDIATRICS); STRENGTHENING COMPLIANCE AND ENFORCEMENT; AND MOVING TO AN INTEGRATED HEALTH SYSTEM (CLOSER COLLABORATION

AND CONSULTATION WITH PROVINCES AND TERRITORIES WITH RESPECT TO ACCESS). IN DECEMBER 2007, THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ISSUED ITS

NEW FOOD AND CONSUMER SAFETY ACTION PLAN,

FOLLOWED BY BILL C-51 (APRIL 2008) WITH PROPOSED LEGISLATIVE AMENDMENTS TO

THE

FOOD AND DRUGS ACT.

THE BILL IS EXPECTED TO BE RE-INTRODUCED IN 2010 AND, IF PASSED, WOULD REPRESENT A SIGNIFICANT DRUG REGULATORY SYSTEM REFORM AND A MAJOR CHANGE TO CANADAS DRUG APPROVAL SYSTEM. UNDER THE LRM AND ITS

LIFE-CYCLE APPROACH TO REGULATION, HEALTH CANADA IS SEEKING TO ESTABLISH FLEXIBILITY IN THE MARKET AUTHORIZATION PROCESS THAT WILL LEAD TO EARLIER AND MORE APPROPRIATE ACCESS FOR PATIENTS TO PROMISING THERAPEUTIC PRODUCTS AS WELL AS

FOCUS ON BEST PATIENT OUTCOMES. CURRENT REGULATORY POLICIES AND INITIATIVES, SUCH AS PRIORITY AND CONDITIONAL APPROVALS, ARE ALREADY PROVIDING FOR INTERNATIONALLY COMPETITIVE APPROVAL TIMELINES. AS IN THE EU,

SUTENT

WAS INITIALLY APPROVED

UNDER THE CONDITIONAL PROVISION.

HEALTH CANADA, UNDER ITS CURRENT REGULATORY AUTHORITY AND DRAFT GUIDANCE OF MARCH 2009,

APPROVED IN APRIL 2009 THE FIRST SUBSEQUENT ENTRY BIOLOGIC (SEB), OMNITROPE, ALSO REFERRED TO IN OTHER JURISDICTIONS AS BIOSIMILAR OR FOLLOW-ON-BIOLOGIC. OMNITROPE USED PFIZERS GENOTROPIN AS ITS REFERENCE PRODUCT TO DEMONSTRATE

COMPARABILITY/SIMILARITY. ACCORDING TO HEALTH CANADA, SEBS LIKE ANY NEW DRUGS CANNOT BE SUBSTITUTED OR USED INTERCHANGEABLY WITH THE REFERENCE PRODUCT USED IN THE STUDIES. FURTHERMORE, THE MODERNIZATION INITIATIVE IS PROPOSING THE INTRODUCTION OF A

LEGISLATIVE AND REGULATORY FRAMEWORK FOR DRUGS FOR RARE DISORDERS (I.E. ORPHAN DRUGS IN THE U.S. AND EU), UPDATED COST RECOVERY FRAMEWORK (I.E., USER FEES), A SPECIFIC REGULATORY FRAMEWORK FOR SEBS AND LEGISLATION STRENGTHENING POST-MARKET SAFETY

REQUIREMENTS.

INTRODUCTORY NON-EXCESSIVE PRICES AND PRICE INCREASES ARE CONTROLLED BY THE FEDERAL PATENTED

MEDICINES PRICES REVIEW BOARD. CANADAS INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY REGIME FOR DRUGS, WHICH WAS IMPLEMENTED UNDER THE DATA PROTECTION REGULATIONS AND PROVIDES FOR A MINIMUM OF EIGHT YEARS OF DATA PROTECTION FOR NEW CHEMICAL ENTITIES, HAS BEEN

CHALLENGED BY RECENT LITIGATION THAT HAS FAVORED GENERIC MANUFACTURERS. THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ALSO

HAS JURISDICTION OVER INTERNATIONAL TRADE AND THEREFORE OVER THE ISSUE OF CROSS-BORDER TRADE IN PHARMACEUTICALS AND INTERNET PHARMACIES.

ENVIRONMENTAL LAW COMPLIANCE

MOST OF OUR OPERATIONS ARE AFFECTED BY NATIONAL, STATE AND/OR LOCAL ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS. WE HAVE MADE, AND INTEND TO CONTINUE TO MAKE, NECESSARY EXPENDITURES FOR COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE LAWS. WE ALSO

ARE CLEANING UP ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINATION FROM PAST INDUSTRIAL ACTIVITY AT CERTAIN SITES (SEE NOTE 19 TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS,

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND CONTINGENCIES,

IN OUR 2009 FINANCIAL REPORT). AS A RESULT, WE INCURRED

CAPITAL AND OPERATIONAL EXPENDITURES IN 2009 FOR ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLIANCE PURPOSES AND FOR THE CLEAN-UP OF CERTAIN PAST INDUSTRIAL ACTIVITY AS FOLLOWS.



ENVIRONMENT-RELATED CAPITAL EXPENDITURES$19.6 MILLION;



OTHER ENVIRONMENT-RELATED EXPENSES$151 MILLION.

WHILE WE CANNOT PREDICT WITH CERTAINTY FUTURE CAPITAL EXPENDITURES OR OPERATING COSTS FOR ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLIANCE, INCLUDING COMPLIANCE WITH PENDING LEGISLATION AND POTENTIAL REGULATION RELATED TO

CLIMATE CHANGE, WE HAVE NO REASON TO BELIEVE THEY WILL HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON OUR CAPITAL EXPENDITURES OR COMPETITIVE POSITION.

WE HAVE REVIEWED THE POTENTIAL FOR PHYSICAL RISKS TO OUR FACILITIES AND SUPPLY CHAIN THAT MAY BE EXACERBATED BY CLIMATE CHANGE AND HAVE CONCLUDED THAT, BECAUSE OF OUR FACILITY LOCATIONS AND OUR EXISTING DISTRIBUTION NETWORKS, WE DO NOT

BELIEVE THESE RISKS ARE MATERIAL IN THE NEAR TERM.

TAX MATTERS

THE DISCUSSION OF TAX-RELATED MATTERS IN NOTE 7 TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS,

TAXES ON INCOME,

IN OUR 2009 FINANCIAL

REPORT, IS INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE.

EMPLOYEES

IN OUR INNOVATION-INTENSIVE BUSINESS, OUR EMPLOYEES ARE VITAL TO OUR SUCCESS. WE BELIEVE WE HAVE GOOD RELATIONSHIPS WITH OUR EMPLOYEES. AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2009, WE EMPLOYED APPROXIMATELY 116,500 PEOPLE IN OUR OPERATIONS THROUGHOUT THE WORLD. TOTAL LEGACY PFIZER HEADCOUNT WAS OVER 74,000 WHILE TOTAL LEGACY WYETH HEADCOUNT WAS MORE THAN 42,000.

RISK FACTORS

THE

STATEMENTS IN THIS SECTION DESCRIBE THE MAJOR RISKS TO OUR BUSINESS AND SHOULD BE CONSIDERED CAREFULLY. IN ADDITION, THESE STATEMENTS CONSTITUTE OUR CAUTIONARY STATEMENTS UNDER THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995.

OUR DISCLOSURE AND ANALYSIS IN THIS 2009 FORM 10-K AND IN OUR 2009 ANNUAL REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS CONTAIN SOME FORWARD-LOOKING

STATEMENTS THAT SET FORTH ANTICIPATED RESULTS BASED ON MANAGEMENTS PLANS AND ASSUMPTIONS. FROM TIME TO TIME, WE ALSO PROVIDE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS IN OTHER MATERIALS WE RELEASE TO THE PUBLIC, AS WELL AS ORAL FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS.

SUCH STATEMENTS GIVE OUR CURRENT EXPECTATIONS OR FORECASTS OF FUTURE EVENTS; THEY DO NOT RELATE STRICTLY TO HISTORICAL OR CURRENT FACTS. WE HAVE TRIED, WHEREVER POSSIBLE, TO IDENTIFY SUCH STATEMENTS BY USING WORDS SUCH AS ANTICIPATE,

ESTIMATE, EXPECT, PROJECT, INTEND, PLAN, BELIEVE, WILL, TARGET, FORECAST AND SIMILAR EXPRESSIONS IN CONNECTION WITH ANY DISCUSSION OF FUTURE

OPERATING OR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE OR BUSINESS PLANS OR PROSPECTS. IN PARTICULAR, THESE INCLUDE STATEMENTS RELATING TO FUTURE ACTIONS, BUSINESS PLANS AND PROSPECTS, PROSPECTIVE PRODUCTS OR PRODUCT APPROVALS, FUTURE PERFORMANCE OR RESULTS OF CURRENT

AND ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS, SALES EFFORTS, EXPENSES, INTEREST RATES, FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES, THE OUTCOME OF CONTINGENCIES, SUCH AS LEGAL PROCEEDINGS, AND FINANCIAL RESULTS.

WE CANNOT GUARANTEE THAT ANY FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENT WILL BE REALIZED, ALTHOUGH WE BELIEVE WE HAVE BEEN PRUDENT IN OUR PLANS AND

ASSUMPTIONS. ACHIEVEMENT OF FUTURE RESULTS IS SUBJECT TO SUBSTANTIAL RISKS, UNCERTAINTIES AND POTENTIALLY INACCURATE ASSUMPTIONS. SHOULD KNOWN OR UNKNOWN RISKS OR UNCERTAINTIES MATERIALIZE, OR SHOULD UNDERLYING ASSUMPTIONS PROVE INACCURATE, ACTUAL

RESULTS COULD DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM PAST RESULTS AND THOSE ANTICIPATED, ESTIMATED OR PROJECTED. YOU SHOULD BEAR THIS IN MIND AS YOU CONSIDER FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS AND YOU ARE CAUTIONED NOT TO PUT UNDUE RELIANCE ON FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS.

WE UNDERTAKE NO OBLIGATION TO PUBLICLY UPDATE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS, WHETHER AS A RESULT OF NEW INFORMATION,

FUTURE EVENTS OR OTHERWISE. YOU ARE ADVISED, HOWEVER, TO CONSULT ANY FURTHER DISCLOSURES WE MAKE ON RELATED SUBJECTS IN OUR 10-Q AND 8-K

REPORTS TO THE SEC. ALSO NOTE THAT WE PROVIDE THE FOLLOWING CAUTIONARY DISCUSSION OF RISKS, UNCERTAINTIES AND POSSIBLY INACCURATE ASSUMPTIONS RELEVANT TO OUR BUSINESSES. THESE ARE FACTORS THAT,

INDIVIDUALLY OR IN THE AGGREGATE, MAY CAUSE OUR ACTUAL RESULTS TO DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM EXPECTED AND HISTORICAL RESULTS. WE NOTE THESE FACTORS FOR INVESTORS AS PERMITTED BY THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995. YOU SHOULD UNDERSTAND

THAT IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO PREDICT OR IDENTIFY ALL SUCH FACTORS. CONSEQUENTLY, YOU SHOULD NOT CONSIDER THE FOLLOWING TO BE A COMPLETE DISCUSSION OF ALL POTENTIAL RISKS OR UNCERTAINTIES.

HEALTH CARE REFORM

BOTH

THE UNITED STATES HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES AND THE UNITED STATES SENATE HAVE PASSED BILLS TO IMPLEMENT SIGNIFICANT HEALTH CARE REFORM. HOWEVER, NEGOTIATIONS BETWEEN THE SENATE AND THE HOUSE HAVE NOT PROGRESSED TO RESOLVE THE DIFFERENCES IN THE BILLS

IT IS UNCERTAIN AT THIS TIME WHETHER AND WHEN HEALTH CARE REFORM MAY BE IMPLEMENTED AND WHAT FORM IT MAY TAKE. THEREFORE, WE CANNOT DETERMINE AT THIS TIME WHAT IMPACT HEALTH CARE REFORM WILL HAVE ON THE COMPANY, IF ANY. FOR EXAMPLE, AS THE BILLS

STAND CURRENTLY, A PROVISION IN THE SENATE BILL WOULD EMPOWER AN ADVISORY PANEL TO RECOMMEND ANNUAL MEDICARE COST-SAVING PROPOSALS. CONGRESS THEN WOULD BE REQUIRED TO CONSIDER THE PROPOSALS ON AN EXPEDITED BASIS, WOULD HAVE LIMITED ABILITY TO REVISE

THEM AND, IF IT FAILS TO ACT, THE ADVISORY PANELS PROPOSALS WOULD BE IMPLEMENTED AUTOMATICALLY. THE ADVISORY PANELS COST-CUTTING PROPOSALS COULD HAVE A NEGATIVE EFFECT ON OUR FUTURE REVENUE.

AS MENTIONED ABOVE, THE PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY PLEDGED AN $80 BILLION CONTRIBUTION OVER 10 YEARS, INCLUDING INCREASED MEDICAID REBATES,

MEDICARE COVERAGE GAP DISCOUNTS, A PATHWAY FOR FOLLOW ON BIOLOGICS AND AN EXCISE TAX OF $2.3 BILLION ANNUALLY. THESE COSTS ARE NOT EXPECTED TO BE OFFSET BY INCREASED SALES FROM COVERAGE OF THE UNINSURED. AT THIS TIME NO ASSURANCES CAN BE GIVEN THAT

HEALTH CARE REFORM WILL NOT HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR REVENUE IN THE FUTURE.

GOVERNMENT REGULATION AND MANAGED CARE TRENDS

U.S. AND FOREIGN GOVERNMENTAL REGULATIONS MANDATING PRICE CONTROLS AND LIMITATIONS ON PATIENT

18

TABLE OF CONTENTS

ACCESS TO OUR PRODUCTS IMPACT OUR BUSINESS, AND OUR FUTURE RESULTS COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY CHANGES IN SUCH REGULATIONS. IN THE U.S., MANY OF OUR BIOPHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS ARE SUBJECT TO

INCREASING PRICING PRESSURES. SUCH PRESSURES HAVE INCREASED AS THE RESULT OF THE 2003 MEDICARE MODERNIZATION ACT DUE TO THE ENHANCED PURCHASING POWER OF THE PRIVATE SECTOR PLANS THAT NEGOTIATE ON BEHALF OF MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES. IN ADDITION, IF THE

2003 MEDICARE MODERNIZATION ACT WERE AMENDED TO IMPOSE DIRECT GOVERNMENTAL PRICE CONTROLS AND ACCESS RESTRICTIONS, IT WOULD HAVE A SIGNIFICANT ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR BUSINESS. FURTHERMORE, MCOS, AS WELL AS MEDICAID AND OTHER GOVERNMENT AGENCIES,

CONTINUE TO SEEK PRICE DISCOUNTS. SOME STATES HAVE IMPLEMENTED, AND OTHER STATES ARE CONSIDERING, PRICE CONTROLS OR PATIENT-ACCESS CONSTRAINTS UNDER THE MEDICAID PROGRAM AND SOME STATES ARE CONSIDERING PRICE-CONTROL REGIMES THAT WOULD APPLY TO

BROADER SEGMENTS OF THEIR POPULATIONS THAT ARE NOT MEDICAID ELIGIBLE. OTHER MATTERS ALSO COULD BE THE SUBJECT OF U.S. FEDERAL OR STATE LEGISLATIVE OR REGULATORY ACTION THAT COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, INCLUDING CHANGES IN PATENT LAWS, THE

IMPORTATION OF PRESCRIPTION DRUGS FROM OUTSIDE THE U.S. AT PRICES THAT ARE REGULATED BY THE GOVERNMENTS OF VARIOUS FOREIGN COUNTRIES, RESTRICTIONS ON U.S. DIRECT-TO-CONSUMER ADVERTISING OR LIMITATIONS ON INTERACTIONS WITH HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS

AND THE USE OF COMPARATIVE EFFECTIVENESS METHODOLOGIES THAT COULD BE IMPLEMENTED IN A MANNER THAT FOCUSES PRIMARILY ON COST DIFFERENCES AND MINIMIZES THE THERAPEUTIC DIFFERENCES AMONG PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS AND RESTRICTS ACCESS TO INNOVATIVE

MEDICINES.

THE PROHIBITION ON THE USE OF FEDERAL FUNDS FOR REIMBURSEMENT OF ERECTILE DYSFUNCTION MEDICATIONS BY THE MEDICAID

PROGRAM, WHICH BECAME EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2006, AND THE SIMILAR FEDERAL FUNDING PROHIBITION FOR THE MEDICARE PART D PROGRAM, WHICH BECAME EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2007, HAS HAD AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS. ANY PROHIBITIONS ON THE USE OF

FEDERAL FUNDS FOR REIMBURSEMENT OF OTHER CLASSES OF DRUGS IN THE FUTURE MAY ALSO HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT.

WE ENCOUNTER SIMILAR

REGULATORY AND LEGISLATIVE ISSUES IN MOST OTHER COUNTRIES. IN EUROPE AND SOME OTHER INTERNATIONAL MARKETS, THE GOVERNMENT PROVIDES HEALTH CARE AT LOW DIRECT COST TO CONSUMERS AND REGULATES PHARMACEUTICAL PRICES OR PATIENT REIMBURSEMENT LEVELS TO

CONTROL COSTS FOR THE GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED HEALTH CARE SYSTEM. THIS INTERNATIONAL PATCHWORK OF PRICE

REGULATION HAS LED TO DIFFERENT PRICES AND SOME THIRD-PARTY TRADE IN OUR PRODUCTS FROM MARKETS WITH LOWER PRICES. SUCH TRADE EXPLOITING PRICE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN COUNTRIES CAN UNDERMINE OUR SALES

IN MARKETS WITH HIGHER PRICES. AS A RESULT, IT IS EXPECTED THAT PRESSURES ON THE PRICING COMPONENT OF OPERATING RESULTS WILL CONTINUE. THE ADOPTION OF RESTRICTIVE PRICE CONTROLS IN NEW JURISDICTIONS OR MORE RESTRICTIVE ONES IN EXISTING JURISDICTIONS

COULD ALSO ADVERSELY IMPACT REVENUE.

GENERIC COMPETITION

COMPETITION FROM MANUFACTURERS OF GENERIC DRUGS IS A MAJOR CHALLENGE FOR US AROUND THE WORLD. UPON THE EXPIRATION OR LOSS OF PATENT PROTECTION FOR ONE OF OUR PRODUCTS, OR UPON THE AT-RISK

LAUNCH (DESPITE PENDING PATENT INFRINGEMENT LITIGATION AGAINST THE GENERIC PRODUCT) BY A GENERIC MANUFACTURER OF A GENERIC VERSION OF ONE OF OUR PRODUCTS, WE CAN LOSE THE MAJOR PORTION OF SALES OF THAT PRODUCT IN A VERY SHORT PERIOD, WHICH CAN

ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS.

ALSO, THE PATENTS COVERING SEVERAL OF OUR MOST IMPORTANT MEDICINES, INCLUDING

LIPITOR,

CADUET, DETROL/DETROL LA, LYRICA, TYGACIL, ZYVOX

AND

ARICEPT,

ARE BEING CHALLENGED BY GENERIC MANUFACTURERS. IN ADDITION, OUR PATENT-PROTECTED PRODUCTS MAY FACE COMPETITION IN THE FORM OF GENERIC VERSIONS OF BRANDED PRODUCTS OF

COMPETITORS THAT LOSE THEIR MARKET EXCLUSIVITY. FOR EXAMPLE,

LIPITOR

BEGAN TO FACE COMPETITION FROM GENERIC PRAVASTATIN (PRAVACHOL) AND GENERIC SIMVASTATIN (ZOCOR) DURING 2006.

COMPETITIVE PRODUCTS

WE CANNOT PREDICT WITH ACCURACY THE TIMING OR IMPACT

OF THE INTRODUCTION OF COMPETITIVE PRODUCTS OR THEIR POSSIBLE EFFECT ON OUR SALES. PRODUCTS THAT COMPETE WITH OURS, INCLUDING SOME OF OUR BEST-SELLING MEDICINES, ARE LAUNCHED FROM TIME TO TIME. COMPETITIVE PRODUCT LAUNCHES HAVE OCCURRED IN RECENT

YEARS AND CERTAIN POTENTIALLY COMPETITIVE PRODUCTS ARE IN VARIOUS STAGES OF DEVELOPMENT, SOME OF WHICH HAVE BEEN FILED FOR APPROVAL WITH THE FDA AND WITH REGULATORY AUTHORITIES IN OTHER COUNTRIES.

DEPENDENCE ON KEY IN-LINE PRODUCTS

WE RECORDED DIRECT PRODUCT REVENUES OF MORE THAN $1 BILLION FOR EACH OF NINE LEGACY PFIZER PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS IN 2009.

LIPITOR, NORVASC,

19

TABLE OF CONTENTS

LYRICA, CELEBREX, VIAGRA, DETROL/DETROL LA, XALATAN/XALACOM

,

GEODON

AND

ZYVOX.

THOSE PRODUCTS ACCOUNTED FOR 56% OF OUR TOTAL BIOPHARMACEUTICAL REVENUES IN 2009.

LIPITOR

SALES IN 2009 WERE APPROXIMATELY $11.4 BILLION, ACCOUNTING FOR APPROXIMATELY 25% OF OUR TOTAL 2009 BIOPHARMACEUTICAL REVENUES. WE DID NOT RECORD MORE THAN $1 BILLION IN REVENUE FOR ANY SINGLE LEGACY WYETH PRODUCT IN 2009, SINCE OUR RESULTS DO

NOT REFLECT REVENUES FOR LEGACY WYETH PRODUCTS BEFORE THE ACQUISITION DATE OF OCTOBER 15, 2009. IF THE PRODUCTS REFERENCED ABOVE OR ANY OF OUR OTHER MAJOR PRODUCTS WERE TO BECOME SUBJECT TO PROBLEMS SUCH AS LOSS OF PATENT PROTECTION, CHANGES IN

PRESCRIPTION GROWTH RATES, MATERIAL PRODUCT LIABILITY LITIGATION, UNEXPECTED SIDE EFFECTS, REGULATORY PROCEEDINGS, PUBLICITY AFFECTING DOCTOR OR PATIENT CONFIDENCE, PRESSURE FROM EXISTING COMPETITIVE PRODUCTS, CHANGES IN LABELING OR IF A NEW, MORE

EFFECTIVE TREATMENT SHOULD BE INTRODUCED, THE ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR REVENUES COULD BE SIGNIFICANT. FOR EXAMPLE, U.S. REVENUES FOR

CHANTIX

DECLINED IN 2009 COMPARED TO 2008 FOLLOWING CHANGES TO THE

CHANTIX

U.S. LABEL DURING 2008 AND

2009. AS NOTED, PATENTS COVERING SEVERAL OF OUR BEST-SELLING MEDICINES HAVE RECENTLY EXPIRED OR WILL EXPIRE IN THE NEXT FEW YEARS, AND PATENTS COVERING A NUMBER OF OUR BEST-SELLING MEDICINES ARE THE SUBJECT OF PENDING LEGAL CHALLENGES. IN ADDITION,

OUR REVENUES COULD BE SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACTED BY THE TIMING AND RATE OF COMMERCIAL ACCEPTANCE OF KEY NEW PRODUCTS.

SPECIALTY

PHARMACEUTICALS

SPECIALTY PHARMACEUTICALS ARE MEDICINES THAT TREAT RARE OR LIFE-THREATENING CONDITIONS THAT HAVE SMALLER

PATIENT POPULATIONS, SUCH AS CERTAIN TYPES OF CANCER, MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS AND HIV. THE GROWING AVAILABILITY AND USE OF INNOVATIVE SPECIALTY PHARMACEUTICALS, COMBINED WITH THEIR RELATIVE HIGHER COST AS COMPARED TO OTHER TYPES OF PHARMACEUTICAL

PRODUCTS, IS BEGINNING TO GENERATE SIGNIFICANT PAYER INTEREST IN DEVELOPING COST CONTAINMENT STRATEGIES TARGETED TO THIS SECTOR. WHILE THE IMPACT ON PFIZER OF PAYERS EFFORTS TO CONTROL ACCESS AND PRICING OF SPECIALTY PHARMACEUTICALS HAS BEEN

LIMITED TO DATE, OUR GROWING PORTFOLIO OF SPECIALTY PRODUCTS, COMBINED WITH THE INCREASING USE OF HEALTH TECHNOLOGY ASSESSMENT IN MARKETS AROUND THE WORLD AND THE DETERIORATING FINANCES OF GOVERNMENTS, MAY LEAD TO A MORE SIGNIFICANT ADVERSE BUSINESS

IMPACT IN THE FUTURE.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT INVESTMENT

THE DISCOVERY AND DEVELOPMENT OF NEW PRODUCTS AS WELL AS THE DEVELOPMENT OF ADDITIONAL USES FOR EXISTING PRODUCTS ARE VERY IMPORTANT TO THE

SUCCESS OF THE COMPANY. HOWEVER, BALANCING CURRENT GROWTH AND INVESTMENT FOR THE FUTURE REMAINS A MAJOR CHALLENGE. OUR ONGOING INVESTMENTS IN NEW PRODUCT INTRODUCTIONS AND IN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT FOR NEW PRODUCTS AND EXISTING PRODUCT EXTENSIONS

COULD EXCEED CORRESPONDING SALES GROWTH. THIS COULD PRODUCE HIGHER COSTS WITHOUT A PROPORTIONAL INCREASE IN REVENUES.

DEVELOPMENT,

REGULATORY APPROVAL AND MARKETING OF PRODUCTS

RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES APPLY PARTICULARLY WITH RESPECT TO PRODUCT-RELATED,

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS. THE OUTCOME OF THE LENGTHY AND COMPLEX PROCESS OF IDENTIFYING NEW COMPOUNDS AND DEVELOPING NEW PRODUCTS IS INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE AS TO WHETHER OR WHEN WE WILL RECEIVE REGULATORY APPROVAL FOR NEW

PRODUCTS OR FOR NEW INDICATIONS OR DOSAGE FORMS FOR EXISTING PRODUCTS. DECISIONS BY REGULATORY AUTHORITIES REGARDING LABELING AND OTHER MATTERS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE AVAILABILITY OR COMMERCIAL POTENTIAL OF OUR PRODUCTS. THERE ALSO ARE MANY

CONSIDERATIONS THAT CAN AFFECT MARKETING OF OUR PRODUCTS AROUND THE WORLD. REGULATORY DELAYS, THE INABILITY TO SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETE CLINICAL TRIALS, CLAIMS AND CONCERNS ABOUT SAFETY AND EFFICACY, NEW DISCOVERIES, PATENT DISPUTES AND CLAIMS ABOUT

ADVERSE SIDE EFFECTS ARE A FEW OF THE FACTORS THAT COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE REALIZATION OF RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT AND PRODUCT-RELATED, FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS.

POST-APPROVAL DATA

AS A CONDITION TO GRANTING MARKETING APPROVAL OF A

PRODUCT, THE FDA MAY REQUIRE A COMPANY TO CONDUCT ADDITIONAL CLINICAL TRIALS. THE RESULTS GENERATED IN THESE PHASE IV TRIALS COULD RESULT IN LOSS OF MARKETING APPROVAL, CHANGES IN PRODUCT LABELING, AND/OR NEW OR INCREASED CONCERNS ABOUT SIDE EFFECTS

OR EFFICACY OF A PRODUCT. THE FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION AMENDMENTS ACT OF 2007 (THE FDAAA) GIVES THE FDA ENHANCED POST-MARKET AUTHORITY, INCLUDING THE EXPLICIT AUTHORITY TO REQUIRE POST-MARKET STUDIES AND CLINICAL TRIALS, LABELING CHANGES BASED

ON NEW SAFETY INFORMATION AND

20

TABLE OF CONTENTS

COMPLIANCE WITH FDA-APPROVED RISK EVALUATION AND MITIGATION STRATEGIES. THE FDAS EXERCISE OF ITS AUTHORITY UNDER THE FDAAA COULD RESULT IN DELAYS OR INCREASED COSTS DURING PRODUCT

DEVELOPMENT, CLINICAL TRIALS AND REGULATORY REVIEW, INCREASED COSTS TO COMPLY WITH ADDITIONAL POST-APPROVAL REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS AND POTENTIAL RESTRICTIONS ON SALES OF APPROVED PRODUCTS. FOREIGN REGULATORY AGENCIES OFTEN HAVE SIMILAR AUTHORITY

AND MAY IMPOSE COMPARABLE COSTS. POST-MARKETING STUDIES, WHETHER CONDUCTED BY US OR BY OTHERS AND WHETHER MANDATED BY REGULATORY AGENCIES OR VOLUNTARY, AND OTHER EMERGING DATA ABOUT MARKETED PRODUCTS, SUCH AS ADVERSE EVENT REPORTS, MAY ALSO

ADVERSELY AFFECT SALES OF OUR PRODUCTS. FURTHER, THE DISCOVERY OF SIGNIFICANT PROBLEMS WITH A PRODUCT SIMILAR TO ONE OF OUR PRODUCTS THAT IMPLICATE (OR ARE PERCEIVED TO IMPLICATE) AN ENTIRE CLASS OF PRODUCTS COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON SALES OF

THE AFFECTED PRODUCTS. ACCORDINGLY, NEW DATA ABOUT OUR PRODUCTS, OR PRODUCTS SIMILAR TO OUR PRODUCTS, COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS DUE TO REAL OR PERCEIVED SIDE EFFECTS OR UNCERTAINTY REGARDING EFFICACY AND, IN SOME CASES, COULD

RESULT IN PRODUCT WITHDRAWAL. FURTHERMORE, NEW DATA AND INFORMATION, INCLUDING INFORMATION ABOUT PRODUCT MISUSE, MAY LEAD GOVERNMENT AGENCIES, PROFESSIONAL SOCIETIES, PRACTICE MANAGEMENT GROUPS OR ORGANIZATIONS INVOLVED WITH VARIOUS DISEASES TO

PUBLISH GUIDELINES OR RECOMMENDATIONS RELATED TO THE USE OF OUR PRODUCTS OR THE USE OF RELATED THERAPIES OR PLACE RESTRICTIONS ON SALES. SUCH GUIDELINES OR RECOMMENDATIONS MAY LEAD TO LOWER SALES OF OUR PRODUCTS.

BIOTECHNOLOGY PRODUCTS

GOVERNMENT REGULATION MAY, IN THE FUTURE, ALLOW MORE PERMISSIVE APPROVAL REGIMES FOR BIOSIMILARS (OR FOLLOW-ON BIOLOGICS). SUCH BIOSIMILARS WOULD REFERENCE BIOTECHNOLOGY PRODUCTS ALREADY APPROVED UNDER THE U.S. PUBLIC HEALTH

SERVICE ACT. IN THE U.S., THERE IS NOT CURRENTLY AN ABBREVIATED LEGAL PATHWAY TO APPROVE BIOSIMILARS; HOWEVER, LEGISLATION TO ESTABLISH SUCH A PATHWAY IS BEING CONSIDERED BY CONGRESS. ADDITIONALLY, THE FDA HAS APPROVED A BIOSIMILAR RECOMBINANT HUMAN

GROWTH HORMONE THAT REFERENCED A BIOTECHNOLOGY PRODUCT APPROVED UNDER THE U.S. FEDERAL FOOD, DRUG, AND COSMETIC ACT. IN EUROPE, THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION HAS GRANTED MARKETING AUTHORIZATIONS FOR SEVERAL BIOSIMILARS PURSUANT TO A SET OF GENERAL AND

PRODUCT CLASS-SPECIFIC GUIDELINES FOR BIOSIMILAR APPROVALS ISSUED OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS. IF COMPETITORS ARE ABLE TO OBTAIN MARKETING

APPROVAL FOR BIOSIMILARS REFERENCING OUR BIOTECHNOLOGY PRODUCTS, OUR BIOTECHNOLOGY PRODUCTS MAY BECOME SUBJECT TO COMPETITION FROM BIOSIMILARS, WITH THE ATTENDANT COMPETITIVE PRESSURE. EXPIRATION

OR SUCCESSFUL CHALLENGE OF APPLICABLE PATENT RIGHTS COULD GENERALLY TRIGGER THIS COMPETITION, ASSUMING ANY RELEVANT DATA EXCLUSIVITY PERIOD HAS EXPIRED. WE EXPECT THAT WE COULD FACE MORE LITIGATION WITH RESPECT TO THE VALIDITY AND/OR SCOPE OF

PATENTS RELATING TO OUR BIOTECHNOLOGY PRODUCTS WITH SUBSTANTIAL REVENUE.

RESEARCH STUDIES

DECISIONS ABOUT RESEARCH STUDIES MADE EARLY IN THE DEVELOPMENT PROCESS OF A DRUG CANDIDATE CAN HAVE A SUBSTANTIAL IMPACT ON THE MARKETING

STRATEGY ONCE THE DRUG RECEIVES APPROVAL. MORE DETAILED STUDIES MAY DEMONSTRATE ADDITIONAL BENEFITS THAT CAN HELP IN THE MARKETING, BUT THEY CONSUME TIME AND RESOURCES AND CAN DELAY SUBMITTING THE DRUG CANDIDATE FOR INITIAL APPROVAL. WE TRY TO PLAN

CLINICAL TRIALS PRUDENTLY, BUT THERE IS NO GUARANTEE THAT A PROPER BALANCE OF SPEED AND TESTING WILL BE MADE IN EACH CASE. THE QUALITY OF OUR DECISIONS IN THIS AREA COULD AFFECT OUR FUTURE RESULTS.

INTEREST RATE AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK

57% OF OUR TOTAL 2009 REVENUES WERE DERIVED FROM INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS, INCLUDING 29% FROM THE EUROPE REGION AND 16% FROM THE JAPAN/ASIA REGION. THESE INTERNATIONAL-BASED REVENUES, AS WELL AS OUR

SUBSTANTIAL INTERNATIONAL NET ASSETS, EXPOSE OUR REVENUES AND EARNINGS TO FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE CHANGES. IN ADDITION, OUR INTEREST-BEARING INVESTMENTS, LOANS AND BORROWINGS ARE SUBJECT TO RISK FROM CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES AND FOREIGN

EXCHANGE RATES. THESE RISKS AND THE MEASURES WE HAVE TAKEN TO HELP CONTAIN THEM ARE DISCUSSED IN THE SECTION ENTITLED

FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT

IN OUR 2009 FINANCIAL REPORT. FOR ADDITIONAL DETAILS, SEE NOTE 9E TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS,

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS: DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES,

IN OUR 2009 FINANCIAL REPORT. THOSE SECTIONS OF OUR 2009 FINANCIAL REPORT ARE INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE.

NOTWITHSTANDING OUR EFFORTS TO FORESEE AND MITIGATE THE EFFECTS OF CHANGES IN FISCAL CIRCUMSTANCES, WE CANNOT PREDICT WITH CERTAINTY CHANGES

IN CURRENCY AND INTEREST RATES, INFLATION OR OTHER RELATED FACTORS AFFECTING OUR BUSINESSES.

21

TABLE OF CONTENTS

RISKS AFFECTING INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS

OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS ALSO COULD BE AFFECTED BY CAPITAL AND EXCHANGE CONTROLS, EXPROPRIATION AND OTHER RESTRICTIVE GOVERNMENT ACTIONS, CHANGES IN INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY LEGAL PROTECTIONS AND

REMEDIES, TRADE REGULATIONS AND PROCEDURES AND ACTIONS AFFECTING APPROVAL, PRODUCTION, PRICING, AND MARKETING OF, REIMBURSEMENT FOR AND ACCESS TO, OUR PRODUCTS, AS WELL AS BY UNSTABLE GOVERNMENTS AND LEGAL SYSTEMS AND INTER-GOVERNMENTAL DISPUTES.

ANY OF THESE CHANGES COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS.

DIVERSIFIED SEGMENT

OUR ANIMAL HEALTH UNIT MAY BE IMPACTED BY CONTINUING GLOBAL ECONOMIC WEAKNESS RESULTING IN HIGH UNEMPLOYMENT RATES AND TIGHT CREDIT

CONDITIONS. A HIGH UNEMPLOYMENT RATE TYPICALLY RESULTS IN REDUCED TRAFFIC IN VETERINARY CLINICS, NEGATIVELY IMPACTING OUR COMPANION ANIMAL BUSINESS. TIGHT CREDIT CONDITIONS LIMIT THE BORROWING POWER OF LIVESTOCK PRODUCERS, CAUSING SOME TO SWITCH TO

LOWER-PRICED ALTERNATIVES.

PFIZER NUTRITION MAY EXPERIENCE SIGNIFICANT FINANCIAL IMPACT ASSOCIATED WITH CHANGES IN NATIONAL,

REGIONAL, AND INTERNATIONAL LAWS, RULES AND GUIDELINES AND THEIR ENFORCEMENT. OUR INFANT AND YOUNG CHILD NUTRITION PRODUCTS ARE SUBJECT TO AN ARRAY OF RULES AND REGULATIONS ENFORCED BY GOVERNMENT ENTITIES AS WELL AS TREATIES, CONVENTIONS AND

GUIDELINES FROM INTERNATIONAL AUTHORITIES. CHANGES TO THESE REQUIREMENTS CAN SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT COSTS RELATING TO TAXES, TARIFFS, TRADE, LABELING, MARKETING, MANUFACTURING, AND THE OVERALL AVAILABILITY OF OUR PRODUCTS.

THE CONSUMER HEALTHCARE UNIT MAY BE IMPACTED BY ECONOMIC VOLATILITY AND GENERIC COMPETITION AFFECTING CONSUMER SPENDING PATTERNS AND MARKET

SHARE GAINS OF COMPETITORS BRANDED PRODUCTS OR GENERIC STORE BRANDS. IN ADDITION, REGULATORY AND LEGISLATIVE OUTCOMES REGARDING THE SAFETY, EFFICACY OR UNINTENDED USES OF SPECIFIC INGREDIENTS IN OUR CONSUMER HEALTHCARE PRODUCTS MAY REQUIRE

WITHDRAWAL AND/OR REFORMULATION OF CERTAIN PRODUCTS (E.G. PSEUDOEPHEDRINE IN COUGH/COLD PRODUCTS).

GLOBAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS

THE GLOBAL ECONOMIC DOWNTURN IN 2009 AND THE CONTINUING ECONOMIC WEAKNESS HAS NOT HAD, NOR DO WE ANTICIPATE IT WILL HAVE,

A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON OUR LIQUIDITY. DUE TO OUR SIGNIFICANT OPERATING CASH FLOW,

FINANCIAL ASSETS, ACCESS TO CAPITAL MARKETS AND AVAILABLE LINES OF CREDIT AND REVOLVING CREDIT AGREEMENTS, WE CONTINUE TO BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO MEET OUR LIQUIDITY NEEDS FOR THE

FORESEEABLE FUTURE. AS MARKET CONDITIONS CHANGE, WE WILL CONTINUE TO MONITOR OUR LIQUIDITY POSITION. HOWEVER, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT OUR LIQUIDITY WILL NOT BE AFFECTED BY RECENT AND POSSIBLE FUTURE CHANGES IN GLOBAL FINANCIAL MARKETS AND

GLOBAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS.

MOREOVER, LIKE OTHER BUSINESSES, OUR RESULTS HAVE BEEN ADVERSELY IMPACTED BY AND MAY CONTINUE TO

BE ADVERSELY IMPACTED BY THE WEAK GLOBAL ECONOMY. THE IMPACT OF THE WEAK ECONOMY ON OUR BIOPHARMACEUTICAL OPERATIONS HAS BEEN LARGELY IN THE U.S. MARKET, AFFECTING PRODUCTS SUCH AS

LIPITOR, CELEBREX

AND

LYRICA

. WE BELIEVE THAT

PATIENTS, EXPERIENCING THE EFFECTS OF THE WEAK ECONOMY, INCLUDING HIGH UNEMPLOYMENT LEVELS, AND FACING INCREASES IN CO-PAYS, ARE SOMETIMES SWITCHING TO GENERICS, DELAYING TREATMENTS, SKIPPING DOSES OR USING LESS EFFECTIVE TREATMENTS TO REDUCE THEIR

COSTS. THE WEAK ECONOMY HAS ALSO INCREASED THE NUMBER OF PATIENTS IN THE MEDICAID PROGRAM, UNDER WHICH SALES OF PHARMACEUTICALS ARE SUBJECT TO SUBSTANTIAL REBATES AND, IN MANY STATES, TO FORMULARY RESTRICTIONS LIMITING ACCESS TO BRAND-NAME DRUGS,

INCLUDING OURS. OUR DIVERSIFIED SEGMENT HAS ALSO BEEN IMPACTED BY THE WEAK ECONOMY, WHICH HAS ADVERSELY AFFECTED GLOBAL SPENDING ON VETERINARY CARE AND ON PERSONAL HEALTHCARE PRODUCTS. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT OUR RESULTS WILL NOT CONTINUE TO

BE AFFECTED BY WEAK GLOBAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS.

DIFFICULTIES OF OUR WHOLESALE DISTRIBUTORS

IN 2009, OUR LARGEST WHOLESALE DISTRIBUTOR ACCOUNTED FOR APPROXIMATELY 17% OF OUR TOTAL REVENUE, AND OUR TOP THREE WHOLESALE DISTRIBUTORS

ACCOUNTED FOR APPROXIMATELY 38% OF OUR TOTAL REVENUE. IF ONE OF OUR SIGNIFICANT WHOLESALE DISTRIBUTORS ENCOUNTERS FINANCIAL OR OTHER DIFFICULTIES, SUCH DISTRIBUTOR MAY DECREASE THE AMOUNT OF BUSINESS THAT IT DOES WITH US, AND WE MAY BE UNABLE TO

COLLECT ALL THE AMOUNTS THAT THE DISTRIBUTOR OWES US ON A TIMELY BASIS OR AT ALL, WHICH COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

PRODUCT MANUFACTURING AND MARKETING RISKS

DIFFICULTIES OR DELAYS IN PRODUCT MANUFACTURING OR MARKETING,

INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE INABILITY TO INCREASE PRODUCTION CAPACITY COMMENSURATE WITH

22

TABLE OF CONTENTS

DEMAND OR THE FAILURE TO PREDICT MARKET DEMAND FOR, OR TO GAIN MARKET ACCEPTANCE OF, APPROVED PRODUCTS, COULD AFFECT FUTURE RESULTS.

COST AND EXPENSE CONTROL/UNUSUAL EVENTS

GROWTH IN COSTS AND EXPENSES,

CHANGES IN PRODUCT, SEGMENT AND GEOGRAPHIC MIX AND THE IMPACT OF ACQUISITIONS, DIVESTITURES, RESTRUCTURINGS, PRODUCT WITHDRAWALS AND OTHER UNUSUAL EVENTS THAT COULD RESULT FROM EVOLVING BUSINESS STRATEGIES, EVALUATION OF ASSET REALIZATION AND

ORGANIZATIONAL RESTRUCTURING COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT FUTURE RESULTS. SUCH RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES INCLUDE, IN PARTICULAR, OUR ABILITY TO REALIZE THE PROJECTED BENEFITS OF OUR COST-REDUCTION INITIATIVES.

CHANGES IN LAWS AND ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

OUR FUTURE RESULTS COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY CHANGES IN LAWS AND REGULATIONS, INCLUDING CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING STANDARDS, TAXATION REQUIREMENTS (INCLUDING TAX-RATE CHANGES, NEW TAX LAWS AND REVISED

TAX LAW AND REGULATORY INTERPRETATIONS INCLUDING CHANGES AFFECTING THE TAXATION BY THE U.S. OF INCOME EARNED OUTSIDE THE U.S. THAT MAY RESULT FROM PENDING AND POSSIBLE FUTURE PROPOSALS), COMPETITION LAWS AND ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS IN THE U.S. AND OTHER

COUNTRIES.

TERRORIST ACTIVITY

OUR FUTURE RESULTS COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY CHANGES IN BUSINESS, POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, INCLUDING THE COST AND AVAILABILITY OF INSURANCE, DUE TO THE THREAT OF TERRORIST ACTIVITY IN THE

U.S. AND OTHER PARTS OF THE WORLD AND RELATED U.S. MILITARY ACTION OVERSEAS.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

WE AND CERTAIN OF OUR SUBSIDIARIES ARE INVOLVED IN VARIOUS PATENT, PRODUCT LIABILITY, CONSUMER, COMMERCIAL, SECURITIES, ENVIRONMENTAL AND TAX

LITIGATIONS AND CLAIMS, GOVERNMENT INVESTIGATIONS, AND OTHER LEGAL PROCEEDINGS THAT ARISE FROM TIME TO TIME IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF OUR BUSINESS. LITIGATION IS INHERENTLY UNPREDICTABLE, AND EXCESSIVE VERDICTS DO OCCUR. ALTHOUGH WE BELIEVE WE HAVE

SUBSTANTIAL DEFENSES IN THESE MATTERS, WE COULD IN THE FUTURE INCUR JUDGMENTS OR ENTER INTO SETTLEMENTS OF CLAIMS THAT

COULD HAVE A MATERIAL

ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN ANY PARTICULAR PERIOD.

PATENT CLAIMS INCLUDE CHALLENGES TO THE COVERAGE AND/OR VALIDITY OF OUR PATENTS ON VARIOUS

PRODUCTS OR PROCESSES. ALTHOUGH WE BELIEVE WE HAVE SUBSTANTIAL DEFENSES TO THESE CHALLENGES WITH RESPECT TO ALL OUR MATERIAL PATENTS, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE AS TO THE OUTCOME OF THESE MATTERS, AND A LOSS IN ANY OF THESE CASES COULD RESULT IN A

LOSS OF PATENT PROTECTION FOR THE DRUG AT ISSUE, WHICH COULD LEAD TO A SIGNIFICANT LOSS OF SALES OF THAT DRUG AND COULD MATERIALLY AFFECT FUTURE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES

WE EXPECT TO CONTINUE TO ENHANCE OUR

IN-LINE PRODUCTS AND PRODUCT PIPELINE THROUGH ACQUISITIONS, LICENSING AND ALLIANCES (SEE

OUR STRATEGIC INITIATIVESSTRATEGY AND RECENT TRANSACTIONS

IN OUR 2009 FINANCIAL REPORT, WHICH IS INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE). HOWEVER, THESE

ENHANCEMENT PLANS ARE SUBJECT TO THE AVAILABILITY AND COST OF APPROPRIATE OPPORTUNITIES AND COMPETITION FROM OTHER PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES THAT ARE SEEKING SIMILAR OPPORTUNITIES.

INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY

WE RELY TO A LARGE EXTENT UPON SOPHISTICATED

INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS AND INFRASTRUCTURE. THE SIZE AND COMPLEXITY OF OUR COMPUTER SYSTEMS MAKE THEM POTENTIALLY VULNERABLE TO BREAKDOWN, MALICIOUS INTRUSION AND RANDOM ATTACK. LIKEWISE, DATA PRIVACY BREACHES BY EMPLOYEES AND OTHERS WITH

PERMITTED ACCESS TO OUR SYSTEMS MAY POSE A RISK THAT SENSITIVE DATA MAY BE EXPOSED TO UNAUTHORIZED PERSONS OR TO THE PUBLIC. WHILE WE HAVE INVESTED HEAVILY IN THE PROTECTION OF DATA AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT OUR

EFFORTS WILL PREVENT BREAKDOWNS OR BREACHES IN OUR SYSTEMS THAT COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS.

FAILURE TO REALIZE ALL OF THE

ANTICIPATED BENEFITS OF THE ACQUISITION OF WYETH

THE SUCCESS OF OUR RECENT ACQUISITION OF WYETH WILL DEPEND, IN LARGE

PART, ON OUR ABILITY TO REALIZE THE ANTICIPATED BENEFITS AND COST SAVINGS FROM INTEGRATING THE OPERATIONS OF PFIZER AND WYETH. IF WE ARE NOT ABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY INTEGRATE THE OPERATIONS OF THE TWO LEGACY COMPANIES, THE ANTICIPATED BENEFITS AND COST

SAVINGS OF THE ACQUISITION MAY NOT BE REALIZED FULLY OR AT ALL OR MAY TAKE LONGER TO REALIZE THAN EXPECTED.

PROPERTIES

WITH THE

ACQUISITION OF WYETH, THE TOTAL OPERATIONAL REAL ESTATE PORTFOLIO INCREASED FROM 45 MILLION SQUARE FEET TO 70 MILLION SQUARE FEET IN 2009. A FURTHER 7.5 MILLION SQUARE FEET OF FACILITIES CURRENTLY ARE NON-OPERATIONAL PENDING DISPOSAL.

OUR GOAL IS TO CONTINUE CONSOLIDATION OF OPERATIONS TO ACHIEVE EFFICIENCIES AND TO DISPOSE OF EXCESS SPACE.

PFIZER CORPORATE

HEADQUARTERS WILL CONTINUE TO BE IN NEW YORK CITY. WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE SPECIALTY CARE CUSTOMER-FOCUSED UNIT (WHICH IS HEADQUARTERED IN THE LEGACY WYETH COLLEGEVILLE, PENNSYLVANIA SITE), THE BIOPHARMACEUTICAL UNITS WILL CONTINUE TO MAINTAIN

THEIR NEW YORK CITY HEADQUARTERS.

THE DIVERSIFIED SEGMENT WILL BE HEADQUARTERED IN THE LEGACY WYETH MADISON, NEW JERSEY SITE.

AS A RESULT OF THE WYETH ACQUISITION, WE HAVE SURPLUS OFFICE SPACE IN THE NORTHEAST U.S. AND WE ARE IN THE PROCESS OF EXITING

SEVERAL LEASED FACILITIES AND SEEKING TO SELL 685 THIRD AVENUE IN NEW YORK CITY, GREAT VALLEY IN PENNSYLVANIA AND THE NEW LONDON, CONNECTICUT OFFICE BUILDING.

OUR BIOPHARMACEUTICAL AND DIVERSIFIED SEGMENTS EXPECT TO CONTINUE TO OWN AND LEASE SPACE AROUND THE WORLD FOR SALES AND MARKETING, CUSTOMER SERVICE AND ADMINISTRATIVE SUPPORT FUNCTIONS. IN MANY LOCATIONS

THESE BUSINESSES WILL BE CO-LOCATED TO ACHIEVE SYNERGIES AND OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCIES. FOLLOWING THE ACQUISITION OF WYETH, GLOBAL INITIATIVES WERE RECENTLY LAUNCHED TO SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE THE GLOBAL OFFICE PORTFOLIO BY YEAR-END 2012 BY DISPOSING OF

OWNED AND LEASED PROPERTIES.

OUR GLOBAL RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT (R&D) FACILITIES SUPPORT BOTH THE BIOTHERAPEUTICS AND

PHARMATHERAPEUTICS R&D ORGANIZATIONS. WE WILL OPERATE BOTH R&D ORGANIZATIONS IN A NUMBER OF LOCATIONS AROUND THE WORLD, WITH HEAVY CONCENTRATION IN NORTH AMERICA AND THE UNITED KINGDOM. WE HAVE STARTED IMPLEMENTATION OF OUR PREVIOUSLY

ANNOUNCED R&D FOOTPRINT REDUCTION OF THE COMBINED PORTFOLIO BY MOVING FORWARD ON OUR FACILITIES-DISPOSITION PROGRAM. THE SALE OF THE FORMER PFIZER R&D ST LOUIS, MISSOURI CAMPUS IS SLATED TO BE COMPLETED

IN EARLY 2010. ALSO, IN 2010, WE EXPECT TO BEGIN THE DISPOSITION PROCESS FOR THE R&D SITES AT PRINCETON, NEW JERSEY, ROUSES POINT IN NEW YORK, AND A PORTION OF THE LA JOLLA, CALIFORNIA

CAMPUS.

WE HAVE VETERINARY MEDICINE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT OPERATIONS IN OWNED OR LEASED FACILITIES IN KALAMAZOO AND

RICHLAND TOWNSHIP IN MICHIGAN; DURHAM, NORTH CAROLINA; THANE, INDIA; SANDWICH, UK; WAVRE, BELGIUM; AND BRISBANE, AUSTRALIA.

OUR GLOBAL MANUFACTURING (PGM) DIVISION IS HEADQUARTERED IN VARIOUS LOCATIONS WITH LEADERSHIP PRIMARILY IN NEW YORK, NEW YORK AND IN PEAPACK, NEW JERSEY. PGM OPERATES PLANTS IN 81 LOCATIONS AROUND THE WORLD THAT MANUFACTURE PRODUCTS FOR OUR

ORGANIZATIONS INCLUDING ANIMAL HEALTH, CONSUMER HEALTHCARE, EMERGING MARKETS, ESTABLISHED PRODUCTS, NUTRITION, PRIMARY CARE, ONCOLOGY AND SPECIALTY/VACCINES. LOCATIONS WITH MAJOR MANUFACTURING FACILITIES INCLUDE BELGIUM, CHINA, GERMANY, IRELAND,

ITALY, JAPAN, PHILIPPINES, PUERTO RICO, SINGAPORE AND THE UNITED STATES. PGM ALSO OPERATES MULTIPLE DISTRIBUTION FACILITIES AROUND THE WORLD. THERE IS AN ACTIVE PLANT NETWORK STRATEGY IN DEVELOPMENT THAT IS EXPECTED TO REDUCE THE SIZE OF THE NETWORK

OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS. IN ADDITION, THE CAPSUGEL UNIT HAS MANUFACTURING FACILITIES IN 10 LOCATIONS AROUND THE WORLD.

IN

GENERAL, WE BELIEVE THAT OUR PROPERTIES ARE WELL MAINTAINED, ADEQUATE AND SUITABLE FOR THEIR PURPOSES. SEE NOTE 11 TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS,

DISCLOSURE

CONTROLS

AS OF THE END OF THE PERIOD COVERED BY THIS 2009 FORM 10-K, WE CARRIED OUT AN EVALUATION, UNDER THE SUPERVISION

AND WITH THE PARTICIPATION OF OUR PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND PRINCIPAL FINANCIAL OFFICER, OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE DESIGN AND OPERATION OF OUR DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES (AS SUCH TERM IS DEFINED IN RULES 13A-15(E) AND

15D-15(E) UNDER THE EXCHANGE ACT). BASED ON THIS EVALUATION, OUR PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND PRINCIPAL FINANCIAL OFFICER CONCLUDED THAT OUR DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES ARE EFFECTIVE IN

ALERTING THEM IN A TIMELY MANNER TO MATERIAL INFORMATION REQUIRED TO BE DISCLOSED IN OUR PERIODIC REPORTS FILED WITH THE SEC.

INTERNAL

CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

MANAGEMENTS REPORT ON THE COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

CHANGES IN INTERNAL CONTROLS

DURING OUR MOST RECENT FISCAL QUARTER, THERE HAS NOT BEEN ANY CHANGE IN OUR INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING (AS SUCH TERM IS DEFINED IN RULES 13A-15(F) AND 15D-15(F) UNDER THE EXCHANGE ACT) THAT HAS MATERIALLY AFFECTED, OR IS

REASONABLY LIKELY TO MATERIALLY AFFECT, OUR INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING. HOWEVER, WE DO WISH TO HIGHLIGHT SOME CHANGES WHICH, TAKEN TOGETHER, ARE EXPECTED TO HAVE A FAVORABLE IMPACT ON OUR CONTROLS OVER A MULTI-YEAR PERIOD. WE CONTINUE

TO PURSUE A MULTI-YEAR INITIATIVE TO OUTSOURCE SOME TRANSACTION-PROCESSING ACTIVITIES WITHIN CERTAIN ACCOUNTING PROCESSES AND ARE MIGRATING TO A CONSISTENT ENTERPRISE RESOURCE PLANNING SYSTEM ACROSS THE ORGANIZATION. THESE ARE ENHANCEMENTS OF

ONGOING ACTIVITIES TO SUPPORT THE GROWTH OF OUR FINANCIAL SHARED SERVICE CAPABILITIES AND STANDARDIZE OUR FINANCIAL SYSTEMS. NONE OF THESE INITIATIVES IS IN RESPONSE TO ANY IDENTIFIED DEFICIENCY OR WEAKNESS IN OUR INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL

REPORTING.
