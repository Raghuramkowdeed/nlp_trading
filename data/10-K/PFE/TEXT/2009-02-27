BUSINESS SEGMENTS

WE OPERATE IN TWO BUSINESS SEGMENTS: PHARMACEUTICAL AND ANIMAL HEALTH.

WE ALSO OPERATE SEVERAL OTHER

BUSINESSES, INCLUDING THE MANUFACTURE OF GELATIN CAPSULES, CONTRACT MANUFACTURING AND BULK PHARMACEUTICAL

CHEMICALS. DUE TO THE SMALL SIZE OF THESE BUSINESSES, THEY ARE GROUPED INTO THE CORPORATE/OTHER CATEGORY OF OUR SEGMENT INFORMATION.

COMPARATIVE SEGMENT REVENUES AND RELATED FINANCIAL INFORMATION FOR 2008, 2007, AND 2006 ARE PRESENTED IN THE TABLES CAPTIONED

SEGMENT

AND

REVENUES BY THERAPEUTIC AREA

IN NOTE 20 TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS,

SEGMENT,

GEOGRAPHIC AND REVENUE INFORMATION,

IN OUR 2008 FINANCIAL REPORT. THE INFORMATION FROM THOSE TABLES IN OUR 2008 FINANCIAL REPORT IS

INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE IN THIS 2008 FORM 10-K.

OUR BUSINESSES ARE HEAVILY REGULATED IN MOST OF THE COUNTRIES WHERE WE OPERATE. IN THE

U.S., THE PRINCIPAL AUTHORITY REGULATING OUR OPERATIONS IS THE FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION (FDA). THE FDA REGULATES THE SAFETY AND EFFICACY OF THE PRODUCTS WE OFFER AND OUR RESEARCH QUALITY, MANUFACTURING PROCESSES, PRODUCT PROMOTION, ADVERTISING

AND PRODUCT LABELING. SIMILAR REGULATIONS EXIST IN MOST OTHER COUNTRIES, AND IN MANY COUNTRIES THE GOVERNMENT ALSO REGULATES OUR PRICES. SEE

GOVERNMENT REGULATION AND PRICE CONSTRAINTS

BELOW.

PHARMACEUTICAL

OUR

PHARMACEUTICAL BUSINESS IS THE LARGEST PHARMACEUTICAL BUSINESS IN THE WORLD. EACH YEAR, PFIZER PHARMACEUTICALS HELP OVER 100 MILLION PEOPLE THROUGHOUT THE WORLD LIVE LONGER, HEALTHIER LIVES. WITH MEDICINES ACROSS 11 THERAPEUTIC AREAS, WE HELP

TO TREAT AND PREVENT MANY OF THE MOST COMMON AND MOST CHALLENGING CONDITIONS OF OUR TIME. OUR PRODUCTS ARE IN CARDIOVASCULAR AND METABOLIC DISEASES; CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM DISORDERS; ARTHRITIS AND PAIN; INFECTIOUS AND RESPIRATORY DISEASES; UROLOGY;

ONCOLOGY; OPHTHALMOLOGY; AND ENDOCRINE DISORDERS.

IN 2008, PHARMACEUTICAL REVENUES OF $44.2 BILLION WERE SLIGHTLY LOWER THAN 2007

REVENUES, REFLECTING THE NEGATIVE IMPACT OF THE LOSS OF U.S. EXCLUSIVITY FOR

NORVASC

(MARCH 2007),

ZYRTEC

(PFIZER CEASED SELLING IN JANUARY 2008) AND

CAMPTOSAR

(FEBRUARY 2008). SOLID OVERALL PERFORMANCE FROM OUR BROAD PORTFOLIO

OF PATENT-PROTECTED PRODUCTS SUCH AS

LYRICA, SUTENT

AND

CELEBREX

, AS WELL AS THE FAVORABLE IMPACT OF FOREIGN EXCHANGE, WERE ABLE TO PARTIALLY OFFSET THESE DECLINES. REVENUES FROM THIS SEGMENT

TABLE OF CONTENTS

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

INNOVATION BY OUR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT OPERATIONS IS VERY IMPORTANT TO THE COMPANYS SUCCESS. OUR GOAL IS TO DISCOVER, DEVELOP AND BRING TO MARKET INNOVATIVE PRODUCTS THAT ADDRESS MAJOR UNMET MEDICAL NEEDS. THIS GOAL HAS BEEN

SUPPORTED BY OUR SUBSTANTIAL RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT INVESTMENTS. WE SPENT $7.9 BILLION IN 2008, $8.1 BILLION IN 2007 AND $7.6 BILLION IN 2006 ON RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT IN SUPPORT OF PFIZERS PHARMACEUTICAL AND ANIMAL HEALTH BUSINESSES.

WE CONDUCT RESEARCH INTERNALLY AND ALSO THROUGH CONTRACTS WITH THIRD PARTIES, THROUGH COLLABORATIONS WITH UNIVERSITIES AND BIOTECHNOLOGY

COMPANIES AND IN COOPERATION WITH OTHER PHARMACEUTICAL FIRMS. WE ALSO SEEK OUT PROMISING COMPOUNDS AND INNOVATIVE TECHNOLOGIES DEVELOPED BY THIRD PARTIES TO INCORPORATE INTO OUR DISCOVERY OR DEVELOPMENT PROCESSES OR PROJECTS, AS WELL AS OUR PRODUCT

LINES, THROUGH ACQUISITION, LICENSING OR OTHER ARRANGEMENTS.

DRUG DISCOVERY AND DEVELOPMENT IS TIME CONSUMING, EXPENSIVE AND

UNPREDICTABLE. ON AVERAGE, ONLY ONE OUT OF MANY THOUSANDS OF CHEMICAL COMPOUNDS DISCOVERED BY RESEARCHERS PROVES TO BE BOTH MEDICALLY EFFECTIVE AND SAFE ENOUGH TO BECOME AN APPROVED MEDICINE. THE PROCESS FROM EARLY DISCOVERY TO DEVELOPMENT TO

REGULATORY APPROVAL CAN TAKE MORE THAN TEN YEARS. DRUG CANDIDATES CAN FAIL AT ANY STAGE OF THE PROCESS. CANDIDATES MAY NOT RECEIVE REGULATORY APPROVAL EVEN AFTER MANY YEARS OF RESEARCH.

WE BELIEVE THAT OUR INVESTMENTS IN RESEARCH HAVE BEEN REWARDED BY THE NUMBER OF PHARMACEUTICAL COMPOUNDS WE HAVE IN ALL STAGES OF DEVELOPMENT. AS OF

YEAR-END 2008, WE HAD 106 PROJECTS IN

5

TABLE OF CONTENTS

DEVELOPMENT, INCLUDING 84 NEW MOLECULAR ENTITIES AND 22 PRODUCT-LINE EXTENSIONS. IN ADDITION, WE HAD MORE THAN 170 PROJECTS IN DISCOVERY RESEARCH. IN RECENT

YEARS, OUR DISCOVERY SCIENTISTS HAVE DELIVERED OVER 125 NEW CHEMICAL COMPOUNDS TO EARLY DEVELOPMENT. MOST RECENTLY, WE INCREASED OUR PHASE III PORTFOLIO BY APPROXIMATELY 60% FROM 16 TO 26 PROGRAMS AT YEAR-END. WHILE THESE NEW CANDIDATES MAY OR MAY

NOT EVENTUALLY RECEIVE REGULATORY APPROVAL, NEW DRUG CANDIDATES ENTERING DEVELOPMENT ARE THE FOUNDATION FOR FUTURE PRODUCTS.

IN ADDITION

TO DISCOVERING AND DEVELOPING NEW PRODUCTS, OUR RESEARCH OPERATIONS ADD VALUE TO OUR EXISTING PRODUCTS BY IMPROVING THEIR EFFECTIVENESS AND BY DISCOVERING NEW USES FOR THEM.

INFORMATION CONCERNING SEVERAL OF OUR DRUG CANDIDATES IN DEVELOPMENT, AS WELL AS SUPPLEMENTAL FILINGS FOR EXISTING PRODUCTS, IS SET FORTH UNDER THE

HEADING

PRODUCT DEVELOPMENTS

IN OUR 2008 FINANCIAL REPORT. THAT INFORMATION IS INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE.

PFIZER PROVIDES A

DETAILED UPDATE OF ITS PIPELINE ON A TWICE-YEARLY BASIS, WHICH IS AVAILABLE AT

WWW.PFIZER.COM/PIPELINE

FOR TRACKING DEVELOPMENT COMPOUNDS ACROSS PFIZERS ROBUST PIPELINE.

OUR COMPETITORS ALSO DEVOTE SUBSTANTIAL FUNDS AND RESOURCES TO RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT. IN ADDITION, THE CONSOLIDATION THAT HAS OCCURRED IN OUR INDUSTRY

HAS CREATED COMPANIES WITH SUBSTANTIAL RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT RESOURCES. WE ALSO COMPETE AGAINST NUMEROUS SMALL BIOTECHNOLOGY COMPANIES IN DEVELOPING POTENTIAL DRUG CANDIDATES. THE EXTENT TO WHICH OUR COMPETITORS ARE SUCCESSFUL IN THEIR RESEARCH

COULD RESULT IN EROSION OF THE SALES OF OUR PRODUCTS AND UNANTICIPATED PRODUCT OBSOLESCENCE.

INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS

WE HAVE SIGNIFICANT OPERATIONS OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES. THEY ARE MANAGED THROUGH THE SAME BUSINESS SEGMENTS AS OUR U.S.

OPERATIONSPHARMACEUTICAL AND ANIMAL HEALTH.

REVENUES FROM OPERATIONS OUTSIDE THE U.S. OF $27.9 BILLION ACCOUNTED FOR 57.7% OF OUR

TOTAL REVENUES IN 2008. REVENUES EXCEEDED $500 MILLION IN EACH OF 14 COUNTRIES OUTSIDE THE U.S. IN 2008. THE U.S. WAS THE ONLY COUNTRY TO CONTRIBUTE MORE THAN

10% OF OUR TOTAL REVENUES, COMPRISING 42.3% OF TOTAL REVENUES IN 2008, 47.8% OF TOTAL REVENUES IN 2007 AND 53.4% OF TOTAL REVENUES IN 2006. JAPAN IS OUR

SECOND-LARGEST NATIONAL MARKET, WITH 7.7% OF OUR TOTAL REVENUES IN 2008, 7.0% IN 2007 AND 6.7% IN 2006.

OUR

INTERNATIONAL BUSINESSES ARE SUBJECT, IN VARYING DEGREES, TO A NUMBER OF RISKS INHERENT IN CARRYING ON BUSINESS IN OTHER COUNTRIES. THESE INCLUDE CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS, CAPITAL AND EXCHANGE CONTROL REGULATIONS, EXPROPRIATION AND OTHER RESTRICTIVE

GOVERNMENT ACTIONS. OUR INTERNATIONAL BUSINESSES ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO GOVERNMENT-IMPOSED CONSTRAINTS, INCLUDING LAWS ON PRICING, REIMBURSEMENT AND ACCESS TO OUR PRODUCTS.

SEE

GOVERNMENT REGULATION AND PRICE CONSTRAINTS

BELOW FOR A DISCUSSION OF THESE MATTERS.

DEPENDING

ON THE DIRECTION OF CHANGE RELATIVE TO THE U.S. DOLLAR, FOREIGN CURRENCY VALUES CAN INCREASE OR DECREASE THE REPORTED DOLLAR VALUE OF OUR NET ASSETS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. IN 2008, BOTH REVENUES AND NET INCOME WERE FAVORABLY IMPACTED BY FOREIGN

EXCHANGE, AS FOREIGN CURRENCY MOVEMENTS RELATIVE TO THE U.S. DOLLAR INCREASED OUR REVENUES AND NET INCOME IN MANY COUNTRIES. WHILE WE CANNOT PREDICT WITH CERTAINTY FUTURE CHANGES IN FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES OR THE EFFECT THEY WILL HAVE ON US, WE

ATTEMPT TO MITIGATE THEIR IMPACT THROUGH OPERATIONAL MEANS AND BY USING VARIOUS FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS. SEE THE DISCUSSION UNDER NOTE 9-D TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS,

MARKETING

IN OUR GLOBAL PHARMACEUTICAL BUSINESS, WE PROMOTE OUR PRODUCTS TO HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS

AND PATIENTS. THROUGH OUR MARKETING ORGANIZATIONS, WE EXPLAIN THE APPROVED USES, BENEFITS AND RISKS OF OUR PRODUCTS TO HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS, SUCH AS DOCTORS, NURSE PRACTITIONERS, PHYSICIAN ASSISTANTS, PHARMACISTS, HOSPITALS, PHARMACY BENEFIT

MANAGERS (PBMS), MANAGED CARE ORGANIZATIONS (MCOS), EMPLOYERS AND GOVERNMENT AGENCIES. WE ALSO MARKET DIRECTLY TO CONSUMERS IN THE U.S. THROUGH DIRECT-TO-CONSUMER ADVERTISING THAT COMMUNICATES THE APPROVED USES, BENEFITS, AND RISKS OF OUR PRODUCTS

WHILE CONTINUING TO MOTIVATE PEOPLE TO HAVE MEANINGFUL CONVERSATIONS WITH THEIR DOCTORS. IN ADDITION, WE SPONSOR GENERAL ADVERTISING TO EDUCATE THE PUBLIC ON DISEASE AWARENESS, IMPORTANT PUBLIC HEALTH ISSUES, AND OUR PATIENT ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS.

OUR OPERATIONS INCLUDE SEVERAL PHARMACEUTICAL SALES ORGANIZATIONS. OUR STRUCTURE ALIGNS THE SALES, MARKETING, AND MEDICAL FUNCTIONS TO

WORK CLOSELY IN TANDEM ALONG THE SAME THERAPEUTIC GROUPS OF PRODUCTS, REINFORCING COMMON COORDINATION, FOCUS, AND ACCOUNTABILITY ACROSS THE ORGANIZATIONS.

OUR PRESCRIPTION PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS ARE SOLD PRINCIPALLY TO WHOLESALERS, BUT WE ALSO SELL DIRECTLY TO RETAILERS, HOSPITALS, CLINICS, GOVERNMENT AGENCIES AND PHARMACIES. WE SEEK TO GAIN ACCESS TO HEALTH AUTHORITY,

PBM AND MCO FORMULARIES (LISTS OF RECOMMENDED, APPROVED, AND/OR REIMBURSED MEDICINES AND OTHER PRODUCTS). WE ALSO WORK WITH MCOS, PBMS, EMPLOYERS AND OTHER APPROPRIATE HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS TO ASSIST THEM WITH DISEASE MANAGEMENT, PATIENT EDUCATION

AND OTHER TOOLS THAT HELP THEIR MEDICAL TREATMENT ROUTINES.

OUR ANIMAL HEALTH BUSINESS ALSO USES ITS OWN SALES ORGANIZATION TO PROMOTE ITS

PRODUCTS. ITS ADVERTISING AND PROMOTION ARE GENERALLY TARGETED TO HEALTH PROFESSIONALS, DIRECTLY AND THROUGH VETERINARY JOURNALS. ANIMAL HEALTH PRODUCTS ARE SOLD THROUGH VETERINARIANS, DISTRIBUTORS AND RETAIL OUTLETS AS WELL AS DIRECTLY TO USERS.

WHERE APPROPRIATE, THESE PRODUCTS ARE ALSO MARKETED THROUGH PRINT AND TELEVISION ADVERTISING.

DURING 2008, SALES TO OUR THREE LARGEST

PHARMACEUTICAL WHOLESALERS WERE AS FOLLOWS.



MCKESSON, INC.16% OF OUR TOTAL REVENUES;



CARDINAL HEALTH, INC.10% OF OUR TOTAL REVENUES; AND



AMERISOURCEBERGEN CORPORATION10% OF OUR TOTAL REVENUES.

SALES TO THESE WHOLESALERS WERE CONCENTRATED IN THE PHARMACEUTICAL SEGMENT. APART FROM THESE INSTANCES, NEITHER OF OUR BUSINESS SEGMENTS IS DEPENDENT ON ANY ONE CUSTOMER OR GROUP OF RELATED CUSTOMERS.

PATENTS AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS

OUR PRODUCTS ARE SOLD AROUND THE WORLD UNDER BRAND-NAME, LOGO AND CERTAIN PRODUCT DESIGN TRADEMARKS THAT WE CONSIDER IN THE AGGREGATE TO BE OF MATERIAL IMPORTANCE. TRADEMARK PROTECTION CONTINUES IN SOME COUNTRIES FOR

AS LONG AS THE MARK IS USED AND, IN OTHER COUNTRIES, FOR AS LONG AS IT IS REGISTERED. REGISTRATIONS GENERALLY ARE FOR FIXED, BUT RENEWABLE, TERMS.

WE OWN OR LICENSE A NUMBER OF U.S. AND FOREIGN PATENTS. THESE PATENTS COVER PHARMACEUTICAL AND OTHER PRODUCTS AND THEIR USES, PHARMACEUTICAL FORMULATIONS, PRODUCT MANUFACTURING PROCESSES AND INTERMEDIATE CHEMICAL COMPOUNDS USED IN

MANUFACTURING.

PATENTS FOR INDIVIDUAL PRODUCTS EXTEND FOR VARYING PERIODS ACCORDING TO THE DATE OF PATENT FILING OR GRANT AND THE LEGAL

TERM OF PATENTS IN THE VARIOUS COUNTRIES WHERE PATENT PROTECTION IS OBTAINED. THE ACTUAL PROTECTION AFFORDED BY A PATENT, WHICH CAN VARY FROM COUNTRY TO COUNTRY, DEPENDS UPON THE TYPE OF PATENT, THE SCOPE OF ITS COVERAGE AND THE AVAILABILITY OF

LEGAL REMEDIES IN THE COUNTRY.

IN THE AGGREGATE, OUR PATENT AND RELATED RIGHTS ARE OF MATERIAL IMPORTANCE TO OUR BUSINESSES IN THE U.S.

AND MOST OTHER COUNTRIES. BASED ON CURRENT PRODUCT SALES, AND CONSIDERING THE VIGOROUS COMPETITION WITH PRODUCTS SOLD BY OTHERS, THE PATENT RIGHTS WE CONSIDER MOST SIGNIFICANT IN RELATION TO OUR BUSINESS AS A WHOLE, TOGETHER WITH THE YEAR IN WHICH

THE U.S. BASIC PRODUCT PATENT EXPIRES (INCLUDING, WHERE APPLICABLE, THE ADDITIONAL SIX-MONTH PEDIATRIC EXCLUSIVITY PERIOD), ARE THOSE FOR THE DRUGS SET FORTH IN THE TABLE BELOW.

IN SOME INSTANCES, THERE ARE LATER-EXPIRING PATENTS RELATING TO OUR PRODUCTS DIRECTED TO

PARTICULAR FORMS OR COMPOSITIONS OF THE DRUG OR TO METHODS OF MANUFACTURING OR USING THE DRUG IN THE TREATMENT OF PARTICULAR DISEASES OR CONDITIONS. HOWEVER, IN SOME CASES, SUCH PATENTS MAY NOT PROTECT THE COMPANYS DRUG FROM GENERIC

COMPETITION AFTER THE EXPIRATION OF THE BASIC PATENT.

THE U.S. BASIC PATENT FOR

CAMPTOSAR

EXPIRED IN FEBRUARY 2008.

ARICEPT

IS PATENTED BY EISAI CO., LTD. WE CO-PROMOTE

ARICEPT

WITH EISAI IN THE U.S. AND SEVERAL OTHER COUNTRIES AND HAVE AN EXCLUSIVE

LICENSE TO SELL THE DRUG IN CERTAIN OTHER COUNTRIES.

IN ADDITION TO OUR U.S. BASIC PRODUCT PATENT FOR

LIPITOR,

WHICH (INCLUDING THE

PEDIATRIC EXCLUSIVITY PERIOD) EXPIRES IN MARCH 2010, WE HAVE A PATENT COVERING SPECIFICALLY THE ENANTIOMERIC FORM OF THE DRUG, WHICH (INCLUDING THE PEDIATRIC EXCLUSIVITY PERIOD) EXPIRES IN JUNE 2011. SEE NOTE 19 TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS,

AND

DETROL/DETROL LA

. IN ADDITION, A

COMPANY HAS FILED AN APPLICATION WITH THE FDA SEEKING APPROVAL TO MARKET A GENERIC VERSION OF

ARICEPT,

WHICH IS PATENTED BY EISAI CO., LTD.

WE ALSO HAVE OTHER PATENT RIGHTS COVERING ADDITIONAL PRODUCTS THAT HAVE LESSER REVENUES THAN MOST OF THE PRODUCTS SET FORTH IN THE TABLE

ABOVE.

THE EXPIRATION OF A BASIC PRODUCT PATENT OR LOSS OF PATENT PROTECTION RESULTING FROM A LEGAL CHALLENGE NORMALLY RESULTS IN

SIGNIFICANT COMPETITION FROM GENERIC PRODUCTS AGAINST THE ORIGINALLY PATENTED PRODUCT AND CAN RESULT IN A SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN SALES OF THAT PRODUCT IN A VERY SHORT PERIOD. IN SOME CASES, HOWEVER, WE CAN CONTINUE TO OBTAIN COMMERCIAL BENEFITS

FROM PRODUCT MANUFACTURING TRADE SECRETS; PATENTS ON USES FOR PRODUCTS; PATENTS ON PROCESSES AND INTERMEDIATES FOR THE ECONOMICAL MANUFACTURE OF THE ACTIVE INGREDIENTS; PATENTS FOR SPECIAL FORMULATIONS OF THE PRODUCT OR DELIVERY MECHANISMS; AND

CONVERSION OF THE ACTIVE INGREDIENT TO OVER-THE-COUNTER PRODUCTS.

ONE OF THE MAIN LIMITATIONS ON OUR OPERATIONS IN SOME COUNTRIES OUTSIDE

THE U.S. IS THE LACK OF EFFECTIVE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY PROTECTION FOR OUR PRODUCTS. UNDER INTERNATIONAL AND U.S. FREE TRADE AGREEMENTS IN RECENT YEARS, GLOBAL PROTECTION OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS HAS BEEN IMPROVING. THE WORLD TRADE

ORGANIZATION AGREEMENT ON TRADE RELATED ASPECTS OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY (WTO-TRIPS) REQUIRED PARTICIPANT COUNTRIES TO AMEND THEIR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY LAWS TO PROVIDE PATENT PROTECTION FOR PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS BY 2005 WITH AN EXTENSION UNTIL

2016 FOR LEAST-DEVELOPED NATIONS. A NUMBER OF COUNTRIES HAVE MADE IMPROVEMENTS. WE HAVE EXPERIENCED SIGNIFICANT GROWTH IN OUR BUSINESSES IN SOME OF THOSE NATIONS, AND OUR CONTINUED BUSINESS EXPANSION IN OTHER PARTICIPANT COUNTRIES DEPENDS TO A LARGE

DEGREE ON FURTHER PATENT PROTECTION IMPROVEMENT.

COMPETITION

OUR BUSINESSES ARE CONDUCTED IN INTENSELY COMPETITIVE AND OFTEN HIGHLY REGULATED MARKETS. MANY OF OUR HUMAN PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS FACE COMPETITION IN

THE FORM OF BRANDED DRUGS OR GENERIC DRUGS THAT TREAT SIMILAR DISEASES OR INDICATIONS. THE PRINCIPAL FORMS OF COMPETITION INCLUDE EFFICACY, SAFETY, EASE OF USE, AND COST EFFECTIVENESS. THOUGH THE MEANS OF COMPETITION VARY AMONG PRODUCT

8

TABLE OF CONTENTS

CATEGORIES AND BUSINESS GROUPS, DEMONSTRATING THE VALUE OF OUR PRODUCTS IS A CRITICAL FACTOR FOR SUCCESS IN ALL OF OUR PRINCIPAL BUSINESSES.

OUR PHARMACEUTICAL BUSINESS IS THE LARGEST IN THE WORLD. OUR COMPETITORS INCLUDE OTHER WORLDWIDE RESEARCH-BASED DRUG COMPANIES, SMALLER RESEARCH

COMPANIES WITH MORE LIMITED THERAPEUTIC FOCUS, AND GENERIC DRUG MANUFACTURERS. WE COMPETE WITH OTHER COMPANIES THAT MANUFACTURE AND SELL PRODUCTS THAT TREAT SIMILAR DISEASES OR INDICATIONS AS OUR MAJOR PRODUCTS.

SUCH COMPETITION AFFECTS OUR CORE PRODUCT BUSINESS, WHICH IS FOCUSED ON APPLYING INNOVATIVE SCIENCE TO DISCOVER AND MARKET PRODUCTS THAT SATISFY UNMET

MEDICAL NEEDS AND PROVIDE THERAPEUTIC IMPROVEMENTS. OUR EMPHASIS ON INNOVATION IS UNDERSCORED BY OUR MULTI-BILLION-DOLLAR INVESTMENT IN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT OVER THE PAST DECADE, RESULTING IN ONE OF THE STRONGEST PRODUCT PIPELINES IN THE

INDUSTRY. OUR INVESTMENT IN RESEARCH DOES NOT STOP WITH A DRUG APPROVAL; WE CONTINUE TO INVEST IN FURTHER UNDERSTANDING THE VALUE OF OUR PRODUCTS FOR THE CONDITIONS THEY TREAT AS WELL AS POTENTIALLY NEW CONDITIONS. WE PROTECT THE HEALTH AND

WELLBEING OF PATIENTS BY ENSURING THAT MEDICALLY SOUND KNOWLEDGE OF THE BENEFITS AND RISKS OF OUR MEDICINES IS UNDERSTOOD AND COMMUNICATED TO PATIENTS, PHYSICIANS AND GLOBAL HEALTH AUTHORITIES. WE ALSO CONTINUE TO ENHANCE THE ORGANIZATIONAL

EFFECTIVENESS OF ALL OF OUR PHARMACEUTICAL FUNCTIONS, INCLUDING COORDINATING SUPPORT FOR OUR SALESPEOPLES EFFORTS TO LAUNCH AND PROMOTE OUR PRODUCTS TO OUR CUSTOMERS.

OPERATING CONDITIONS HAVE BECOME MORE CHALLENGING UNDER THE MOUNTING GLOBAL PRESSURES OF COMPETITION, INDUSTRY REGULATION AND COST CONTAINMENT. WE

RECENTLY HAVE TAKEN AND CONTINUE TO TAKE MEASURES TO EVALUATE, ADAPT AND IMPROVE OUR ORGANIZATION AND BUSINESS PRACTICES TO BETTER MEET CUSTOMER AND PUBLIC NEEDS. FOR INSTANCE, WE HAVE TAKEN AN INDUSTRY-LEADING ROLE IN EVOLVING OUR APPROACHES TO

U.S. DIRECT-TO-CONSUMER ADVERTISING, INTERACTIONS WITH, AND PAYMENTS TO, HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONALS AND MEDICAL EDUCATION GRANTS. WE ALSO CONTINUE TO SPONSOR PROGRAMS TO ADDRESS PATIENT AFFORDABILITY AND ACCESS BARRIERS, AS WE STRIVE TO ADVANCE

FUNDAMENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM CHANGE THROUGH SUPPORT FOR BETTER HEALTHCARE SOLUTIONS.

WHILE OUR ANIMAL HEALTH BUSINESS IS ONE OF THE LARGEST

IN THE WORLD, MANY OTHER COMPANIES OFFER COMPETITIVE PRODUCTS. ALTOGETHER, THERE ARE HUNDREDS

OF PRODUCERS OF ANIMAL HEALTH PRODUCTS THROUGHOUT THE WORLD. THE PRINCIPAL METHODS OF COMPETITION VARY SOMEWHAT DEPENDING ON THE PARTICULAR PRODUCT. THEY

INCLUDE PRODUCT INNOVATION, QUALITY, PRICE, SERVICE AND EFFECTIVE PROMOTION TO VETERINARY PROFESSIONALS AND CONSUMERS.

MANAGED CARE ORGANIZATIONS

THE GROWTH OF MCOS IN THE U.S. HAS BEEN A MAJOR FACTOR IN THE COMPETITIVE MAKEUP OF THE HEALTHCARE MARKETPLACE. APPROXIMATELY

249 MILLION PEOPLE IN THE U.S. NOW PARTICIPATE IN SOME VERSION OF MANAGED CARE. BECAUSE OF THE SIZE OF THE PATIENT POPULATION COVERED BY MCOS, THE MARKETING OF PRESCRIPTION DRUGS TO THEM AND THE PBMS THAT SERVE MANY OF THOSE ORGANIZATIONS

CONTINUES TO GROW IN IMPORTANCE.

MCOS CAN INCLUDE MEDICAL INSURANCE COMPANIES, MEDICAL PLAN ADMINISTRATORS, HEALTH-MAINTENANCE

ORGANIZATIONS, ALLIANCES OF HOSPITALS AND PHYSICIANS AND OTHER PHYSICIAN ORGANIZATIONS. THE PURCHASING POWER OF MCOS HAS INCREASED IN RECENT YEARS DUE TO THE GROWING NUMBERS OF PATIENTS ENROLLED IN MCOS. AT THE SAME TIME, THOSE ORGANIZATIONS HAVE

BEEN CONSOLIDATING INTO FEWER, EVEN LARGER ENTITIES. THIS CONSOLIDATION ENHANCES THEIR PURCHASING STRENGTH AND IMPORTANCE TO US.

THE

GROWTH OF MCOS HAS INCREASED PRESSURE ON DRUG PRICES. ONE OBJECTIVE OF MCOS IS TO CONTAIN AND, WHERE POSSIBLE, REDUCE HEALTHCARE EXPENDITURES. THEY TYPICALLY USE FORMULARIES, VOLUME PURCHASES AND LONG-TERM CONTRACTS TO NEGOTIATE DISCOUNTS FROM

PHARMACEUTICAL PROVIDERS. THEY USE THEIR PURCHASING POWER TO BARGAIN FOR LOWER SUPPLIER PRICES. THEY ALSO EMPHASIZE PRIMARY AND PREVENTIVE CARE, OUT-PATIENT TREATMENT AND PROCEDURES PERFORMED AT DOCTORS OFFICES AND CLINICS. HOSPITALIZATION AND

SURGERY, TYPICALLY THE MOST EXPENSIVE FORMS OF TREATMENT, ARE CAREFULLY MANAGED. SINCE THE USE OF CERTAIN DRUGS CAN PREVENT THE NEED FOR HOSPITALIZATION, PROFESSIONAL THERAPY OR EVEN SURGERY, SUCH DRUGS CAN BECOME FAVORED FIRST-LINE TREATMENTS FOR

CERTAIN DISEASES.

AS DISCUSSED ABOVE IN

MARKETING

, MCOS AND PBMS TYPICALLY DEVELOP FORMULARIES. FORMULARIES CAN BE BASED ON THE

PRICES AND THERAPEUTIC BENEFITS OF THE AVAILABLE PRODUCTS. DUE TO THEIR GENERALLY LOWER COST, GENERIC MEDICINES ARE OFTEN FAVORED. THE BREADTH OF THE PRODUCTS COVERED BY FORMULARIES CAN VARY

9

TABLE OF CONTENTS

CONSIDERABLY FROM ONE MCO TO ANOTHER AND MANY FORMULARIES INCLUDE ALTERNATIVE AND COMPETITIVE PRODUCTS FOR TREATMENT OF PARTICULAR MEDICAL PROBLEMS. MCOS USE

A VARIETY OF MEANS TO ENCOURAGE PATIENTS USE OF PRODUCTS LISTED ON THEIR FORMULARIES.

EXCLUSION OF A PRODUCT FROM A FORMULARY OR

OTHER RESTRICTIONS, SUCH AS REQUIRING PRIOR AUTHORIZATIONS, CAN LEAD TO ITS SHARPLY REDUCED USAGE IN THE MCO PATIENT POPULATION. CONSEQUENTLY, PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES COMPETE AGGRESSIVELY TO HAVE THEIR PRODUCTS INCLUDED. WHERE POSSIBLE, COMPANIES

COMPETE FOR INCLUSION BASED UPON UNIQUE FEATURES OF THEIR PRODUCTS, SUCH AS GREATER EFFICACY, BETTER PATIENT EASE OF USE OR FEWER SIDE EFFECTS. A LOWER OVERALL COST OF THERAPY IS ALSO AN IMPORTANT FACTOR. PRODUCTS THAT DEMONSTRATE FEWER THERAPEUTIC

ADVANTAGES MUST COMPETE FOR INCLUSION BASED PRIMARILY ON PRICE. WE HAVE BEEN GENERALLY, ALTHOUGH NOT UNIVERSALLY, SUCCESSFUL IN HAVING OUR MAJOR PRODUCTS INCLUDED ON MOST MCO FORMULARIES.

THE IMPACT OF MCOS ON DRUG PRICES AND VOLUMES HAS INCREASED AS THE RESULT OF THEIR ROLE IN NEGOTIATING ON BEHALF OF MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES IN CONNECTION

WITH THE MEDICARE OUT-PATIENT PRESCRIPTION DRUG BENEFIT, MEDICARE PART D, THAT TOOK EFFECT JANUARY 1, 2006. MCOS AND PBMS NEGOTIATE ON BEHALF OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AS PRESCRIPTION DRUG PLANS (PDPS). WE HAVE BEEN GENERALLY, ALTHOUGH NOT

UNIVERSALLY, SUCCESSFUL IN HAVING OUR MAJOR PRODUCTS THAT ARE USED BY THE SENIOR POPULATION INCLUDED ON THE FORMULARIES OF THE NEW MEDICARE PDPS FOR 2006, 2007 AND 2008.

GENERIC PRODUCTS

ONE OF THE BIGGEST COMPETITIVE CHALLENGES THAT WE FACE IS FROM GENERIC

PHARMACEUTICAL MANUFACTURERS. UPON THE EXPIRATION OR LOSS OF PATENT PROTECTION FOR A PRODUCT, WE CAN LOSE THE MAJOR PORTION OF SALES OF THAT PRODUCT IN A VERY SHORT PERIOD. SEVERAL SUCH COMPETITORS MAKE A REGULAR PRACTICE OF CHALLENGING OUR PRODUCT

PATENTS BEFORE THEIR EXPIRY. GENERIC COMPETITORS OPERATE WITHOUT OUR LARGE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES AND OUR COSTS OF CONVEYING MEDICAL INFORMATION ABOUT OUR PRODUCTS TO THE MEDICAL COMMUNITY. IN ADDITION, THE FDA APPROVAL PROCESS EXEMPTS

GENERICS FROM COSTLY AND TIME-CONSUMING CLINICAL TRIALS TO DEMONSTRATE THEIR SAFETY AND EFFICACY, ALLOWING GENERIC MANUFACTURERS TO RELY ON THE SAFETY AND EFFICACY DATA OF THE

INNOVATOR PRODUCT. GENERIC PRODUCTS NEED ONLY DEMONSTRATE A LEVEL OF AVAILABILITY IN THE BLOODSTREAM EQUIVALENT TO THAT OF THE INNOVATOR PRODUCT. THIS MEANS

THAT GENERIC COMPETITORS CAN MARKET A COMPETING VERSION OF OUR PRODUCT AFTER THE EXPIRATION OR LOSS OF OUR PATENT AND CHARGE MUCH LESS.

IN

ADDITION, OUR PATENT-PROTECTED PRODUCTS CAN FACE COMPETITION IN THE FORM OF GENERIC VERSIONS OF BRANDED PRODUCTS OF COMPETITORS THAT LOSE THEIR MARKET EXCLUSIVITY. FOR EXAMPLE,

LIPITOR

BEGAN TO FACE COMPETITION FROM GENERIC PRAVASTATIN

(PRAVACHOL) AND GENERIC SIMVASTATIN (ZOCOR) DURING 2006.

AS NOTED ABOVE, MCOS THAT FOCUS PRIMARILY ON THE IMMEDIATE COST OF DRUGS OFTEN

FAVOR GENERICS OVER BRAND-NAME DRUGS. MANY GOVERNMENTS ALSO ENCOURAGE THE USE OF GENERICS AS ALTERNATIVES TO BRAND-NAME DRUGS IN THEIR HEALTHCARE PROGRAMS, INCLUDING MEDICAID IN THE U.S. LAWS IN THE U.S. GENERALLY ALLOW, AND IN SOME CASES REQUIRE,

PHARMACISTS TO SUBSTITUTE GENERIC DRUGS THAT HAVE BEEN RATED UNDER GOVERNMENT PROCEDURES TO BE THERAPEUTICALLY EQUIVALENT TO BRAND-NAME DRUGS. THE SUBSTITUTION MUST BE MADE UNLESS THE PRESCRIBING PHYSICIAN EXPRESSLY FORBIDS IT. IN THE U.S.,

PFIZERS GREENSTONE SUBSIDIARY SELLS GENERIC VERSIONS OF PFIZERS AS WELL AS OUR COMPETITORS PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS UPON LOSS OF EXCLUSIVITY, AS APPROPRIATE.

RAW MATERIALS

RAW MATERIALS ESSENTIAL TO OUR BUSINESSES ARE PURCHASED

WORLDWIDE IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS FROM NUMEROUS SUPPLIERS. IN GENERAL, THESE MATERIALS ARE AVAILABLE FROM MULTIPLE SOURCES. NO SERIOUS SHORTAGES OR DELAYS WERE ENCOUNTERED IN 2008, AND NONE ARE EXPECTED IN 2009. THE RISE IN THE PRICE OF

CRUDE OIL HAS RESULTED IN PRICING PRESSURES ON RAW MATERIALS THAT ARE DERIVED FROM PETROLEUM AND USED IN OUR BUSINESSES.

GOVERNMENT REGULATION AND PRICE CONSTRAINTS

IN THE UNITED STATES

GENERAL.

PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES ARE SUBJECT TO EXTENSIVE REGULATION BY NATIONAL, STATE AND LOCAL AGENCIES IN THE COUNTRIES IN WHICH THEY DO

BUSINESS. OF PARTICULAR IMPORTANCE IS THE FDA IN THE U.S. IT HAS JURISDICTION OVER OUR HUMAN PHARMACEUTICAL BUSINESS AND ADMINISTERS REQUIREMENTS COVERING THE TESTING,

10

TABLE OF CONTENTS

SAFETY, EFFECTIVENESS, MANUFACTURING, LABELING, MARKETING, ADVERTISING AND POST-MARKETING SURVEILLANCE OF OUR PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS. THE FDA ALSO REGULATES

OUR ANIMAL HEALTH PRODUCTS, ALONG WITH THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE AND THE U.S. ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY.

IN ADDITION, MANY

OF OUR ACTIVITIES ARE SUBJECT TO THE JURISDICTION OF VARIOUS OTHER FEDERAL REGULATORY AND ENFORCEMENT DEPARTMENTS AND AGENCIES, SUCH AS THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES (HHS), THE FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION AND THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE.

INDIVIDUAL STATES, ACTING THROUGH THEIR ATTORNEYS GENERAL, HAVE BECOME ACTIVE AS WELL, SEEKING TO REGULATE THE MARKETING OF PRESCRIPTION DRUGS UNDER STATE CONSUMER PROTECTION AND FALSE ADVERTISING LAWS.

WE ARE SUBJECT TO POSSIBLE ADMINISTRATIVE AND LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND ACTIONS BY THESE VARIOUS REGULATORY BODIES (SEE NOTE 19 TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS,

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND CONTINGENCIES,

IN OUR 2008 FINANCIAL REPORT). SUCH ACTIONS MAY INCLUDE PRODUCT RECALLS, SEIZURES AND OTHER CIVIL AND CRIMINAL SANCTIONS.

THE U.S. CONGRESS AND THE FDA ARE CONSIDERING PROPOSALS TO CHANGE HOW THE FDA ASSESSES FOLLOW-ON BIOLOGICAL PRODUCTS. DEPENDING ON THE

SPECIFIC PROVISIONS, LEGISLATIVE OR REGULATORY CHANGES THAT WOULD FACILITATE THE APPROVAL OF SUCH PRODUCTS COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON THE COMPANYS BUSINESS.

MEDICARE.

IN DECEMBER 2003, THE MEDICARE PRESCRIPTION DRUG, IMPROVEMENT, AND MODERNIZATION ACT OF 2003 (THE 2003 MEDICARE MODERNIZATION ACT) WAS ENACTED. MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES ARE NOW ELIGIBLE TO OBTAIN

SUBSIDIZED PRESCRIPTION DRUG COVERAGE FROM A CHOICE OF PRIVATE SECTOR PLANS. APPROXIMATELY 90 PERCENT OF MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES NOW HAVE COVERAGE FOR PRESCRIPTION MEDICINES WITH HIGH LEVELS OF BENEFICIARY SATISFACTION AND LOWER-THAN-EXPECTED COSTS

TO THE GOVERNMENT AND TO BENEFICIARIES. IT REMAINS DIFFICULT TO PREDICT THE LONG-TERM IMPACT OF THE 2003 MEDICARE MODERNIZATION ACT ON PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES. THE USE OF PHARMACEUTICALS HAS INCREASED SLIGHTLY AMONG SOME PATIENTS AS THE RESULT OF

THE EXPANDED ACCESS TO MEDICINES AFFORDED BY COVERAGE UNDER MEDICARE. HOWEVER, SUCH EXPANDED UTILIZATION HAS BEEN LARGELY OFFSET BY INCREASED PRICING PRESSURE AND COMPETITION

DUE TO THE ENHANCED PURCHASING POWER OF THE PRIVATE SECTOR PLANS THAT NEGOTIATE ON BEHALF OF MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES AND BY AN INCREASE IN THE USE OF GENERIC

MEDICINES IN THIS POPULATION. DESPITE THE SUCCESS OF MEDICARE PART D, LEGISLATIVE CHANGES HAVE BEEN PROPOSED TO MANDATE GOVERNMENT REBATES IN MEDICARE AND TO ALLOW THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO DIRECTLY NEGOTIATE PRICES WITH PHARMACEUTICAL

MANUFACTURERS. IT IS EXPECTED THAT IF LEGISLATION WERE ENACTED TO MANDATE REBATES OR PROVIDE FOR DIRECT GOVERNMENT NEGOTIATION IN MEDICARE PART D, ACCESS AND REIMBURSEMENT FOR OUR PRODUCTS WOULD BE RESTRICTED.

PFIZER IS COMMITTED TO HELPING ENSURE THAT ALL AMERICANS WITHOUT COVERAGE FOR PRESCRIPTION MEDICINES HAVE ACCESS TO PFIZER PRODUCTS. TO THAT END, IN

2004, WE IMPLEMENTED OUR HELPFUL ANSWERS PROGRAM, AN UMBRELLA PROGRAM THAT BRINGS TOGETHER PFIZERS LONG-STANDING PATIENT ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS WITH PFIZER PFRIENDS, A PRESCRIPTION DISCOUNT CARD OFFERING SAVINGS ON PFIZER PRESCRIPTION MEDICINES

FOR ALL AMERICANS WITHOUT PRESCRIPTION DRUG COVERAGE, REGARDLESS OF AGE OR INCOME. IN ADDITION, IN JANUARY 2005, WE JOINED TOGETHER RX ACCESS WITH NINE OTHER PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES TO OFFER SAVINGS ON OVER 275 MEDICINES TO MEDICARE-INELIGIBLE,

UNINSURED INDIVIDUALS UNDER 65 WHO FALL BELOW CERTAIN INCOME THRESHOLDS. PFIZER ALSO PARTICIPATES IN THE PARTNERSHIP FOR PRESCRIPTION ASSISTANCE, A SINGLE POINT OF ACCESS TO MORE THAN 475 PUBLIC AND PRIVATE PATIENT ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS.

IMPORTATION OF DRUGS.

THERE CONTINUE TO BE LEGISLATIVE PROPOSALS TO AMEND U.S. LAW TO ALLOW THE IMPORTATION INTO THE U.S. OF PRESCRIPTION DRUGS

FROM OUTSIDE THE U.S., WHICH CAN BE SOLD AT PRICES THAT ARE REGULATED BY THE GOVERNMENTS OF VARIOUS FOREIGN COUNTRIES. IN ADDITION TO WELL- DOCUMENTED SAFETY CONCERNS, SUCH IMPORTATION COULD IMPACT PHARMACEUTICAL PRICES IN THE U.S. WHILE THE 2003

MEDICARE MODERNIZATION ACT MAINTAINS A PROHIBITION ON SUCH IMPORTS, IT WOULD ALLOW IMPORTATION FROM CANADA IF THE SECRETARY OF HHS CERTIFIES THAT SUCH IMPORTATION IS SAFE AND WOULD RESULT IN SAVINGS TO CONSUMERS. BEFORE THE 2003 MEDICARE

MODERNIZATION ACT, FEDERAL LAW WOULD HAVE PERMITTED IMPORTATION OF MEDICINES INTO THE U.S. FROM A CONSIDERABLY LARGER GROUP OF DEVELOPED COUNTRIES, PROVIDED THE SECRETARY OF HHS MADE THE SAME SAFETY AND COST-SAVINGS CERTIFICATIONS.

11

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE SECRETARIES OF HHS IN BOTH THE CLINTON AND GEORGE W. BUSH ADMINISTRATIONS DECLINED TO CERTIFY THAT IMPORTATION OF MEDICINES IS SAFE AND SAVES MONEY. IF

THE NEW SECRETARY OF HHS WERE TO CERTIFY THAT IMPORTATION IS SAFE AND SAVES MONEY, AN INCREASE IN CROSS-BORDER TRADE IN MEDICINES SUBJECT TO FOREIGN PRICE CONTROLS IN OTHER COUNTRIES COULD OCCUR.

IN DECEMBER 2004, HHS AND THE DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE ISSUED REPORTS ON DRUG IMPORTATION AND FOREIGN PRICE CONTROLS. THE HHS REPORT NOTED THAT IT WOULD BE

EXTRAORDINARILY DIFFICULT TO ENSURE THAT DRUGS PERSONALLY IMPORTED BY INDIVIDUAL CONSUMERS COULD MEET THE STANDARDS OF SAFETY THAT WOULD SUPPORT CERTIFYING SUCH IMPORTATION AS SAFE. WHILE THE REPORT ALSO CONCLUDED THAT THE U.S. COULD

ESTABLISH A FEASIBLE BASIS FOR COMMERCIAL DRUG IMPORTATION, SUCH A CHANGE IN THE LAW WOULD REQUIRE NEW LEGAL AUTHORITIES, SUBSTANTIAL ADDITIONAL RESOURCES AND SIGNIFICANT RESTRICTIONS ON THE TYPES OF DRUGS THAT COULD BE IMPORTED. THE

REPORT ALSO NOTED THAT THE TOTAL SAVINGS TO BE EXPECTED FROM SUCH A COMMERCIAL IMPORTATION REGIME WOULD BE RELATIVELY SMALL1% OR 2% OF TOTAL DRUG SPENDING IN THE U.S. THE COMMERCE DEPARTMENT REPORT CONFIRMED THAT THE LOWER PRICES IN MANY

COUNTRIES RESULT FROM GOVERNMENTAL PRICE CONTROLS, AND THESE PRICE CONTROLS ADVERSELY AFFECT THE AMOUNT OF FUNDING THAT IS AVAILABLE FOR THE DISCOVERY OF NEW DRUGS. RAND HEALTH, A DIVISION OF THE RAND CORPORATION, RELEASED A STUDY IN DECEMBER 2008

SHOWING THAT PRICE CONTROLS IN THE U.S. WOULD HAVE A SIGNIFICANT NEGATIVE IMPACT ON HEALTH IN BOTH THE U.S. AND ABROAD BY DETERRING THE INVESTMENT THAT LEADS TO THE DISCOVERY OF NEW MEDICINES.

MEDICAID AND RELATED MATTERS.

FEDERAL LAW REQUIRES US TO GIVE REBATES TO STATE MEDICAID AGENCIES BASED ON EACH STATES REIMBURSEMENT OF

PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS UNDER THE MEDICAID PROGRAM. IN RECENT YEARS, VARIOUS PROPOSALS HAVE BEEN OFFERED AT THE FEDERAL AND STATE LEVELS THAT WOULD BRING ABOUT MAJOR CHANGES IN THE MEDICAID PROGRAM. IN THE SHORT TERM, DRIVEN BY BUDGET CONCERNS, MANY

STATES HAVE IMPLEMENTED RESTRICTIVE DRUG LISTS AND STATE SUPPLEMENTAL REBATE PROGRAMS UNDER THE MEDICAID PROGRAM. THE DOWNTURN IN STATE REVENUES, COUPLED WITH AN ANTICIPATED INCREASE IN MEDICAID PROGRAM ENROLLMENT DUE TO A DECLINING ECONOMY, COULD

CAUSE REBATE PAYMENTS TO RISE IN 2009. THE MAJORITY OF STATES USE PREFERRED DRUG LISTS TO RESTRICT ACCESS TO CERTAIN MEDICINES TO MEDICAID BENEFICIARIES.

RESTRICTIONS EXIST FOR SOME PFIZER PRODUCTS IN CERTAIN STATES. ACCESS IN THE MEDICAID MANAGED CARE PROGRAM IS TYPICALLY DETERMINED BY THE HEALTH PLANS

PROVIDING COVERAGE FOR MEDICAID RECIPIENTS CONTRACTING FOR THE PROVISION OF SERVICES IN THE STATE. ACCESS MAY VARY BY PLAN. HOWEVER, THERE HAVE BEEN LEGISLATIVE PROPOSALS TO APPLY GOVERNMENT MANDATED MEDICAID REBATES TO THE MEDICAID MANAGED CARE

PROGRAM.

EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2007, CHANGES TO THE TREATMENT OF AUTHORIZED GENERICS FOR PURPOSES OF CALCULATING MEDICAID REBATES

INCREASED THE AMOUNT OF REBATES WE ARE REQUIRED TO PAY ON BRAND NAME DRUG SALES AFTER LOSS OF EXCLUSIVITY AND ON AUTHORIZED GENERIC SALES TO THE MEDICAID PROGRAM. IN AN EFFORT TO INCREASE COVERAGE OF THE LOW INCOME UNINSURED, A NUMBER OF STATES ARE

ALSO CONSIDERING EXPANSION OF ELIGIBILITY FOR THEIR MEDICAID PROGRAMS THAT WOULD RESULT IN INCREASED EXPOSURE TO MEDICAID REBATES, THOUGH MOSTLY TO POPULATIONS THAT CURRENTLY DO NOT HAVE PRESCRIPTION DRUG COVERAGE.

SOME STATES ARE CONSIDERING PRICE-CONTROL REGIMES THAT WOULD APPLY TO BROADER SEGMENTS OF THEIR POPULATIONS THAT ARE NOT MEDICAID ELIGIBLE.

IF MANY STATES WERE TO REQUIRE INCREASED REBATE PAYMENTS IN DISCOUNT PROGRAMS FOR THE UNINSURED AND LINK MEDICAID BENEFICIARIES ACCESS TO OUR

PRODUCTS TO SUCH DISCOUNT PROGRAMS, THE IMPACT ON PATIENTS ACCESS TO MEDICINES AND ON PFIZER COULD BE SIGNIFICANT.

WE ALSO MUST GIVE

DISCOUNTS OR REBATES ON PURCHASES OR REIMBURSEMENTS OF PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS BY CERTAIN OTHER FEDERAL AND STATE AGENCIES AND PROGRAMS. SEE THE DISCUSSION REGARDING REBATES IN THE

REVENUES

MARKETING RESTRICTIONS

. A NUMBER OF STATES ARE CONSIDERING PROGRAMS TO CONTROL PHARMACEUTICAL MARKETING ACTIVITIES THAT GO BEYOND COMMITMENTS MADE RELATED TO ADHERING TO THE RECENTLY REVISED AND STRENGTHENED

PHRMA CODE FOR INTERACTIONS WITH HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONALS. IF IMPLEMENTED, SUCH EFFORTS HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO LIMIT APPROPRIATE COMMUNICATION ACTIVITIES WITH HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONALS PRESCRIBING OUR MEDICATIONS.

HEALTH REFORM.

MASSACHUSETTS CONTINUES TO PROGRESS IN THE IMPLEMENTATION OF ITS PROGRAM FOR HEALTH REFORM. BEGINNING ON JANUARY 1, 2009, HEALTH

PLANS PARTICIPATING IN THE MASSACHUSETTS PROGRAM WERE REQUIRED TO PROVIDE A PHARMACY BENEFIT. HOWEVER, THE BENEFIT REQUIREMENT IS EXPECTED TO HAVE A MINIMAL IMPACT ON REVENUE. FOLLOW-ON COST CONTAINMENT LEGISLATION PASSED IN MASSACHUSETTS AT THE END

OF 2008, INCLUDING MARKETING RESTRICTIONS, MAY ALSO MINIMIZE THE POTENTIAL POSITIVE OF THE COVERAGE REQUIREMENT.

OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES

WE ENCOUNTER SIMILAR REGULATORY AND LEGISLATIVE ISSUES IN MOST OTHER COUNTRIES. IN EUROPE, CANADA AND SOME OTHER INTERNATIONAL MARKETS,

THE GOVERNMENT PROVIDES HEALTHCARE AT LOW DIRECT COST TO CONSUMERS AND REGULATES PHARMACEUTICAL PRICES OR PATIENT REIMBURSEMENT LEVELS TO CONTROL COSTS FOR THE GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED HEALTHCARE SYSTEM. THIS INTERNATIONAL PATCHWORK OF PRICE REGULATION

HAS LED TO DIFFERENT PRICES AND SOME THIRD-PARTY TRADE IN OUR PRODUCTS FROM MARKETS WITH LOWER PRICES. SUCH TRADE EXPLOITING PRICE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN COUNTRIES CAN UNDERMINE OUR SALES IN MARKETS WITH HIGHER PRICES.

THE APPROVAL OF NEW DRUGS ACROSS THE EUROPEAN UNION (EU) MAY ONLY BE ACHIEVED USING THE MUTUAL RECOGNITION PROCEDURE/DECENTRALIZED PROCEDURE OR EU

COMMISSION/EUROPEAN MEDICINES AGENCY (EMEA) CENTRAL APPROVAL PROCESS, WHICH APPLIES IN THE 27 EU MEMBER STATES, PLUS NORWAY AND ICELAND, WHICH ARE FULL PARTICIPANTS IN THESE REGISTRATION PROCESSES. THE USE OF THESE PROCEDURES PROVIDES A MORE RAPID

AND CONSISTENT APPROVAL ACROSS THE MEMBER STATES THAN WAS THE CASE WHEN THE APPROVAL PROCESSES WERE OPERATING INDEPENDENTLY WITHIN EACH COUNTRY.

SINCE THE EU DOES NOT HAVE JURISDICTION OVER PATIENT REIMBURSEMENT OR PRICING MATTERS IN ITS MEMBER STATES, WE CONTINUE TO DEAL WITH INDIVIDUAL COUNTRIES ON SUCH MATTERS ACROSS THE REGION.

DURING 2004, A COMPREHENSIVE PACKAGE OF REFORMS WAS ADOPTED (CALLED NEW MEDICINES LEGISLATION) AMENDING EU LAW ON THE REGULATION OF MEDICINAL PRODUCTS IN

MANY AREAS, INCLUDING APPROVAL PROCEDURES AND SAFETY REPORTING. OF PARTICULAR NOTE, THE DATA EXCLUSIVITY PERIODS DURING WHICH INNOVATIVE COMPANIES REGULATORY DATA ARE PROTECTED ARE REQUIRED TO BE HARMONIZED IN ALL MEMBER STATES.

IMPLEMENTATION IS COMPLETE OR UNDERWAY IN MOST MEMBER STATES, WHICH WILL FACILITATE THE APPROVAL AND LAUNCH OF GENERIC MEDICINES. IN ADDITION, THESE REFORMS

INTRODUCED A CLEAR LEGAL BASIS FOR THE APPROVAL OF BIOSIMILAR OR FOLLOW-ON BIOLOGICAL PRODUCTS IN THE EU. FOLLOWING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THESE NEW REGULATIONS (IN NOVEMBER 2005), THE FIRST SUCH PRODUCTS, INCLUDING A

BIOSIMILAR VERSION OF

GENOTROPIN

, WERE APPROVED IN THE EU IN 2006. THE NEW REGULATIONS ALSO SHORTENED CERTAIN APPROVAL TIMELINES AND INTRODUCED FAST-TRACK AND CONDITIONAL CENTRALIZED AUTHORIZATIONS. PFIZERS

SUTENT

WAS THE FIRST

PRODUCT TO BE CONDITIONALLY APPROVED UNDER THE NEW LAW IN 2006 (ALTHOUGH ITS STATUS SUBSEQUENTLY WAS CONVERTED TO FULL AUTHORIZATION).

JANUARY 26, 2007, THE NEW EU REGULATION ON MEDICINES FOR PEDIATRIC USE BECAME EFFECTIVE. THIS INTRODUCED NEW OBLIGATIONS ON PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES TO CONDUCT RESEARCH ON THEIR MEDICINES FOR CHILDREN AND, SUBJECT TO VARIOUS CONDITIONS, OFFERED

THE POSSIBILITY OF INCENTIVES FOR SO DOING, INCLUDING EXCLUSIVITY EXTENSIONS. THE AIM OF THIS REGULATION IS TO IMPROVE THE HEALTH OF CHILDREN IN THE EU THROUGH HIGH QUALITY RESEARCH, STIMULATING THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW MEDICINES, CREATING

INFRASTRUCTURE TO ENABLE AUTHORIZED USE AND IMPROVING THE INFORMATION ON MEDICINES FOR CHILDREN. A PEDIATRIC COMMITTEE (PDCO) WAS CREATED WITHIN THE EMEA TO PROVIDE SCIENTIFIC OPINIONS AND INPUT ON DEVELOPMENT PLANS FOR MEDICINES FOR USE WITH

CHILDREN.

ON NOVEMBER 28, 2007, THE EU COMMISSION HOSTED THE TRANSATLANTIC ADMINISTRATIVE SIMPLIFICATION WORKSHOP CO-CHAIRED BY THE

EU COMMISSION AND THE FDA, IN CO-OPERATION WITH THE EMEA AND THE HEADS OF EUROPEAN MEDICINES AGENCIES, TO IDENTIFY OPPORTUNITIES FOR ADMINISTRATIVE SIMPLIFICATION BETWEEN THE U.S. AND THE EU IN THE FIELD OF PHARMACEUTICAL REGULATION. THESE

OPPORTUNITIES INCLUDED POSSIBLE HARMONIZATION OF ADMINISTRATIVE PRACTICES AND GUIDELINES, NOT NECESSITATING CHANGES IN REGULATIONS, WHILE MAINTAINING OR INCREASING THE CURRENT LEVELS OF PUBLIC HEALTH PROTECTION. BY FREEING UP RESOURCES, THIS

COOPERATION WILL ALLOW THE INDUSTRY TO FOCUS MORE OF ITS RESOURCES ON DEVELOPING AND SUPPLYING MEDICINES TO MEET THE NEEDS OF PATIENTS.

IN

CANADA, THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT CONTROLS DRUG APPROVALS, PATENTED DRUG PRICES, THE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY REGIME AND REIMBURSEMENT FOCUSED MAINLY

TABLE OF CONTENTS

ON ABORIGINAL CANADIANS. HEALTH CANADA IS THE GOVERNMENT AGENCY THAT PROVIDES REGULATORY AND MARKETING APPROVAL FOR DRUGS AND THERAPEUTIC PRODUCTS. IN

OCTOBER 2006, HEALTH CANADA INTRODUCED ITS MODERNIZATION INITIATIVE UNDER THE

BLUEPRINT FOR RENEWAL: MODERNIZING CANADAS REGULATORY SYSTEM FOR HEALTH PRODUCTS AND FOOD

POLICY FRAMEWORK. THE

BLUEPRINT

INCLUDES TEN OBJECTIVES AMONG

WHICH ARE: THE PROGRESSIVE LICENSING FRAMEWORK (PLF) FOR PHARMACEUTICALS AND BIOLOGICS; ADOPTING A PRODUCT LIFE-CYCLE APPROACH TO REGULATIONS; STRONGER POST-MARKET SAFETY AND SURVEILLANCE SYSTEMS; INCREASED TRANSPARENCY AND OPENNESS; EMPHASIS ON

SPECIAL POPULATIONS (ESTABLISHED THE EXPERT ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON PEDIATRICS); STRENGTHENING COMPLIANCE AND ENFORCEMENT; AND MOVING TO AN INTEGRATED HEALTH SYSTEM (CLOSER COLLABORATION AND CONSULTATION WITH PROVINCES AND TERRITORIES WITH RESPECT TO

ACCESS). IN DECEMBER 2007, THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ISSUED ITS

NEW FOOD AND CONSUMER SAFETY ACTION PLAN

FOLLOWED BY BILL C-51 (APRIL 2008) WITH PROPOSED LEGISLATIVE AMENDMENTS TO THE

FOOD AND DRUGS ACT.

THE BILL IS EXPECTED TO BE

RE-INTRODUCED IN 2009 AND, IF PASSED, WOULD REPRESENT A MOST SIGNIFICANT DRUG REGULATORY SYSTEM REFORM AND MAJOR CHANGE TO CANADAS DRUG APPROVAL SYSTEM. UNDER THE PLF, HEALTH CANADA IS SEEKING TO ESTABLISH FLEXIBILITY IN THE MARKET

AUTHORIZATION PROCESS THAT WILL LEAD TO EARLIER AND MORE APPROPRIATE ACCESS FOR PATIENTS TO PROMISING THERAPEUTIC PRODUCTS AS WELL AS FOCUS ON BEST PATIENT OUTCOMES. CURRENT REGULATORY POLICIES AND INITIATIVES, SUCH AS PRIORITY AND CONDITIONAL

APPROVALS, ARE ALREADY PROVIDING FOR INTERNATIONALLY COMPETITIVE APPROVAL TIMELINES. AS IN THE EU,

SUTENT

WAS INITIALLY APPROVED UNDER THE CONDITIONAL PROVISION. FURTHERMORE, THE MODERNIZATION INITIATIVE IS PROPOSING THE INTRODUCTION OF A

REGULATORY PATHWAY FOR BIOSIMILARS REFERRED TO AS SUBSEQUENT ENTRY BIOLOGICS WHICH IS SIMILAR TO THE FOLLOW-ON BIOLOGICS CONCEPT IN THE U.S.

INTRODUCTORY NON-EXCESSIVE PRICES AND PRICE INCREASES ARE CONTROLLED BY THE FEDERAL PATENTED MEDICINES PRICES REVIEW BOARD. CANADAS

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY REGIME FOR DRUGS, WHICH WAS RECENTLY IMPLEMENTED UNDER THE DATA PROTECTION REGULATIONS AND PROVIDES FOR A MINIMUM OF EIGHT YEARS OF DATA PROTECTION FOR NEW CHEMICAL ENTITIES, HAS BEEN CHALLENGED BY RECENT LITIGATION THAT HAS

FAVORED GENERIC MANUFACTURERS. THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ALSO HAS JURISDICTION OVER INTERNATIONAL TRADE AND THEREFORE OVER THE ISSUE OF CROSS-BORDER TRADE IN PHARMACEUTICALS AND INTERNET PHARMACIES.

ENVIRONMENTAL LAW COMPLIANCE

MOST OF OUR OPERATIONS ARE AFFECTED BY

FEDERAL, STATE AND/OR LOCAL ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS. WE HAVE MADE, AND INTEND TO CONTINUE TO MAKE, NECESSARY EXPENDITURES FOR COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE LAWS. WE ALSO ARE CLEANING UP ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINATION FROM PAST INDUSTRIAL ACTIVITY AT CERTAIN

SITES (SEE NOTE 19 TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS,

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND CONTINGENCIES,

IN OUR 2008 FINANCIAL REPORT). AS A RESULT, WE INCURRED CAPITAL AND OPERATIONAL EXPENDITURES IN 2008 FOR ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLIANCE PURPOSES AND

FOR THE CLEAN-UP OF CERTAIN PAST INDUSTRIAL ACTIVITY AS FOLLOWS.



ENVIRONMENT-RELATED CAPITAL EXPENDITURES$64 MILLION



OTHER ENVIRONMENT-RELATED EXPENSES$156 MILLION

WHILE WE CANNOT PREDICT WITH CERTAINTY FUTURE CAPITAL EXPENDITURES OR OPERATING COSTS FOR ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLIANCE, WE DO NOT BELIEVE THEY WILL HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON OUR CAPITAL EXPENDITURES OR COMPETITIVE

POSITION.

TAX MATTERS

THE DISCUSSION OF TAX-RELATED MATTERS IN NOTE 7 TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS,

TAXES ON INCOME,

IN OUR 2008 FINANCIAL REPORT, IS INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE.

EMPLOYEES

IN OUR

INNOVATION-INTENSIVE BUSINESS, OUR EMPLOYEES ARE VITAL TO OUR SUCCESS. WE BELIEVE WE HAVE GOOD RELATIONSHIPS WITH OUR EMPLOYEES. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2008, WE EMPLOYED APPROXIMATELY 81,800 PEOPLE IN OUR OPERATIONS THROUGHOUT THE WORLD.

OUR DISCLOSURE AND ANALYSIS IN THIS 2008 FORM 10-K AND IN OUR 2008 ANNUAL REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS CONTAIN SOME FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS THAT SET

14

TABLE OF CONTENTS

FORTH ANTICIPATED RESULTS BASED ON MANAGEMENTS PLANS AND ASSUMPTIONS. FROM TIME TO TIME, WE ALSO PROVIDE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS IN OTHER

MATERIALS WE RELEASE TO THE PUBLIC, AS WELL AS ORAL FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS. SUCH STATEMENTS GIVE OUR CURRENT EXPECTATIONS OR FORECASTS OF FUTURE EVENTS; THEY DO NOT RELATE STRICTLY TO HISTORICAL OR CURRENT FACTS. WE HAVE TRIED, WHEREVER

POSSIBLE, TO IDENTIFY SUCH STATEMENTS BY USING WORDS SUCH AS ANTICIPATE, ESTIMATE, EXPECT, PROJECT, INTEND, PLAN, BELIEVE, WILL, TARGET,

FORECAST AND SIMILAR EXPRESSIONS IN CONNECTION WITH ANY DISCUSSION OF FUTURE OPERATING OR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE OR BUSINESS PLANS OR PROSPECTS. IN PARTICULAR, THESE INCLUDE STATEMENTS RELATING TO FUTURE ACTIONS, BUSINESS PLANS AND

PROSPECTS, PROSPECTIVE PRODUCTS OR PRODUCT APPROVALS, FUTURE PERFORMANCE OR RESULTS OF CURRENT AND ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS, SALES EFFORTS, EXPENSES, INTEREST RATES, FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES, THE OUTCOME OF CONTINGENCIES, SUCH AS LEGAL PROCEEDINGS, AND

FINANCIAL RESULTS.

WE CANNOT GUARANTEE THAT ANY FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENT WILL BE REALIZED, ALTHOUGH WE BELIEVE WE HAVE BEEN

PRUDENT IN OUR PLANS AND ASSUMPTIONS. ACHIEVEMENT OF FUTURE RESULTS IS SUBJECT TO RISKS, UNCERTAINTIES AND POTENTIALLY INACCURATE ASSUMPTIONS. SHOULD KNOWN OR UNKNOWN RISKS OR UNCERTAINTIES MATERIALIZE, OR SHOULD UNDERLYING ASSUMPTIONS PROVE

INACCURATE, ACTUAL RESULTS COULD DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM PAST RESULTS AND THOSE ANTICIPATED, ESTIMATED OR PROJECTED. YOU SHOULD BEAR THIS IN MIND AS YOU CONSIDER FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS.

WE UNDERTAKE NO OBLIGATION TO PUBLICLY UPDATE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS, WHETHER AS A RESULT OF NEW INFORMATION, FUTURE EVENTS OR OTHERWISE. YOU ARE

ADVISED, HOWEVER, TO CONSULT ANY FURTHER DISCLOSURES WE MAKE ON RELATED SUBJECTS IN OUR 10-Q AND 8-K REPORTS TO THE SEC. ALSO NOTE THAT WE PROVIDE THE FOLLOWING CAUTIONARY DISCUSSION OF RISKS, UNCERTAINTIES AND POSSIBLY INACCURATE ASSUMPTIONS

RELEVANT TO OUR BUSINESSES. THESE ARE FACTORS THAT, INDIVIDUALLY OR IN THE AGGREGATE, MAY CAUSE OUR ACTUAL RESULTS TO DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM EXPECTED AND HISTORICAL RESULTS. WE NOTE THESE FACTORS FOR INVESTORS AS PERMITTED BY THE PRIVATE SECURITIES

LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995. YOU SHOULD UNDERSTAND THAT IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO PREDICT OR IDENTIFY ALL SUCH FACTORS. CONSEQUENTLY, YOU SHOULD NOT CONSIDER THE FOLLOWING TO BE A COMPLETE DISCUSSION OF ALL POTENTIAL RISKS OR UNCERTAINTIES.

GOVERNMENT REGULATION AND MANAGED CARE TRENDS

U.S.

AND FOREIGN GOVERNMENTAL REGULATIONS MANDATING PRICE CONTROLS AND LIMITATIONS ON PATIENT ACCESS TO OUR PRODUCTS IMPACT OUR BUSINESS, AND OUR FUTURE RESULTS COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY CHANGES IN SUCH REGULATIONS. IN THE U.S., MANY OF OUR

PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS ARE SUBJECT TO INCREASING PRICING PRESSURES. SUCH PRESSURES HAVE INCREASED AS THE RESULT OF THE 2003 MEDICARE MODERNIZATION ACT DUE TO THE ENHANCED PURCHASING POWER OF THE PRIVATE SECTOR PLANS THAT NEGOTIATE ON BEHALF OF

MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES. IN ADDITION, IF THE 2003 MEDICARE MODERNIZATION ACT WERE AMENDED TO IMPOSE DIRECT GOVERNMENTAL PRICE CONTROLS AND ACCESS RESTRICTIONS, IT WOULD HAVE A SIGNIFICANT ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR BUSINESS. IN ADDITION, MCOS, AS WELL AS

MEDICAID AND OTHER GOVERNMENT AGENCIES, CONTINUE TO SEEK PRICE DISCOUNTS. SOME STATES HAVE IMPLEMENTED AND OTHER STATES ARE CONSIDERING PRICE CONTROLS OR PATIENT-ACCESS CONSTRAINTS UNDER THE MEDICAID PROGRAM AND SOME STATES ARE CONSIDERING

PRICE-CONTROL REGIMES THAT WOULD APPLY TO BROADER SEGMENTS OF THEIR POPULATIONS THAT ARE NOT MEDICAID ELIGIBLE. OTHER MATTERS ALSO COULD BE THE SUBJECT OF U.S. FEDERAL OR STATE LEGISLATIVE OR REGULATORY ACTION THAT COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR

BUSINESS, INCLUDING CHANGES IN PATENT LAWS, THE IMPORTATION OF PRESCRIPTION DRUGS FROM OUTSIDE THE U.S. AT PRICES THAT ARE REGULATED BY THE GOVERNMENTS OF VARIOUS FOREIGN COUNTRIES, RESTRICTIONS ON U.S. DIRECT-TO-CONSUMER ADVERTISING OR LIMITATIONS

ON INTERACTIONS WITH HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONALS AND THE USE OF COMPARATIVE EFFECTIVENESS METHODOLOGIES THAT COULD BE IMPLEMENTED IN A MANNER THAT FOCUSES PRIMARILY ON THE COST DIFFERENCES AND MINIMIZES THE THERAPEUTIC DIFFERENCES AMONG PHARMACEUTICAL

PRODUCTS.

THE PROHIBITION ON THE USE OF FEDERAL FUNDS FOR REIMBURSEMENT OF ED MEDICATIONS BY THE MEDICAID PROGRAM, WHICH BECAME EFFECTIVE

JANUARY 1, 2006, AND THE SIMILAR FEDERAL FUNDING PROHIBITION FOR THE MEDICARE PART D PROGRAM, WHICH BECAME EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2007, HAS HAD AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS. ANY PROHIBITIONS ON THE USE OF FEDERAL FUNDS FOR REIMBURSEMENT

OF OTHER CLASSES OF DRUGS IN THE FUTURE MAY ALSO HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT.

WE ENCOUNTER SIMILAR REGULATORY AND LEGISLATIVE ISSUES IN MOST

OTHER COUNTRIES. IN EUROPE AND SOME OTHER INTERNATIONAL MARKETS, THE GOVERNMENT PROVIDES HEALTHCARE AT LOW DIRECT COST TO CONSUMERS AND

15

TABLE OF CONTENTS

REGULATES PHARMACEUTICAL PRICES OR PATIENT REIMBURSEMENT LEVELS TO CONTROL COSTS FOR THE GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED HEALTHCARE SYSTEM. THIS INTERNATIONAL PATCHWORK

OF PRICE REGULATION HAS LED TO DIFFERENT PRICES AND SOME THIRD-PARTY TRADE IN OUR PRODUCTS FROM MARKETS WITH LOWER PRICES. SUCH TRADE EXPLOITING PRICE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN COUNTRIES CAN UNDERMINE OUR SALES IN MARKETS WITH HIGHER PRICES. AS A RESULT,

IT IS EXPECTED THAT PRESSURES ON THE PRICING COMPONENT OF OPERATING RESULTS WILL CONTINUE.

GENERIC COMPETITION

COMPETITION FROM MANUFACTURERS OF GENERIC DRUGS IS A MAJOR CHALLENGE FOR US AROUND THE WORLD. UPON THE EXPIRATION OR LOSS OF PATENT PROTECTION FOR ONE OF

OUR PRODUCTS, OR UPON THE AT-RISK LAUNCH (DESPITE PENDING PATENT INFRINGEMENT LITIGATION AGAINST THE GENERIC PRODUCT) BY A GENERIC MANUFACTURER OF A GENERIC VERSION OF ONE OF OUR PRODUCTS, WE CAN LOSE THE MAJOR PORTION OF SALES OF THAT

PRODUCT IN A VERY SHORT PERIOD, WHICH CAN ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS. FOR EXAMPLE, THE U.S. BASIC PATENT FOR

CAMPTOSAR

EXPIRED IN FEBRUARY 2008.

ALSO, THE PATENTS COVERING SEVERAL OF OUR MOST IMPORTANT MEDICINES, INCLUDING

LIPITOR, CELEBREX, DETROL/DETROL LA,

AND

ARICEPT,

ARE BEING CHALLENGED BY GENERIC MANUFACTURERS. IN ADDITION, OUR

PATENT-PROTECTED PRODUCTS MAY FACE COMPETITION IN THE FORM OF GENERIC VERSIONS OF BRANDED PRODUCTS OF COMPETITORS THAT LOSE THEIR MARKET EXCLUSIVITY. FOR EXAMPLE,

LIPITOR

BEGAN TO FACE COMPETITION FROM GENERIC PRAVASTATIN (PRAVACHOL) AND

GENERIC SIMVASTATIN (ZOCOR) DURING 2006.

COMPETITIVE PRODUCTS

WE CANNOT PREDICT WITH ACCURACY THE TIMING OR IMPACT OF THE INTRODUCTION OF COMPETITIVE PRODUCTS OR THEIR POSSIBLE EFFECT ON OUR SALES. PRODUCTS THAT COMPETE WITH OUR DRUGS, INCLUDING SOME OF OUR BEST-SELLING

MEDICINES, ARE LAUNCHED FROM TIME TO TIME. LAUNCHES OF A NUMBER OF COMPETITIVE PRODUCTS HAVE OCCURRED IN RECENT YEARS, AND CERTAIN POTENTIALLY COMPETITIVE PRODUCTS ARE IN VARIOUS STAGES OF DEVELOPMENT, SOME OF WHICH HAVE BEEN FILED FOR APPROVAL WITH

THE FDA AND WITH REGULATORY AUTHORITIES IN OTHER COUNTRIES.

DEPENDENCE ON KEY IN-LINE AND NEW PRODUCTS

WE RECORDED DIRECT PRODUCT REVENUES OF MORE THAN $1 BILLION FOR EACH OF NINE PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS IN 2008.

LIPITOR, NORVASC, LYRICA, CELEBREX,

VIAGRA, DETROL/DETROL LA, XALATAN/XALACOM

,

GEODON

AND

ZYVOX.

THOSE PRODUCTS ACCOUNTED FOR 60% OF OUR TOTAL PHARMACEUTICAL REVENUES IN 2008.

LIPITOR

SALES IN 2008 WERE APPROXIMATELY $12.4 BILLION, ACCOUNTING FOR 28% OF OUR

TOTAL 2008 PHARMACEUTICAL REVENUES. IF THE OTHER PRODUCTS OR ANY OF OUR OTHER MAJOR PRODUCTS WERE TO BECOME SUBJECT TO PROBLEMS SUCH AS LOSS OF PATENT PROTECTION, CHANGES IN PRESCRIPTION GROWTH RATES, MATERIAL PRODUCT LIABILITY LITIGATION,

UNEXPECTED SIDE EFFECTS, REGULATORY PROCEEDINGS, PUBLICITY AFFECTING DOCTOR OR PATIENT CONFIDENCE OR PRESSURE FROM EXISTING COMPETITIVE PRODUCTS, CHANGES IN LABELING OR IF A NEW, MORE EFFECTIVE TREATMENT SHOULD BE INTRODUCED, THE ADVERSE IMPACT ON

OUR REVENUES COULD BE SIGNIFICANT. FOR EXAMPLE, U.S. REVENUES FOR

CHANTIX

DECLINED SIGNIFICANTLY IN 2008 COMPARED TO 2007 FOLLOWING CHANGES TO THE

CHANTIX

U.S. LABEL DURING 2008. AS NOTED, PATENTS COVERING SEVERAL OF OUR BEST-SELLING

MEDICINES HAVE RECENTLY EXPIRED OR WILL EXPIRE IN THE NEXT FEW YEARS, AND PATENTS COVERING A NUMBER OF OUR BEST-SELLING MEDICINES ARE THE SUBJECT OF PENDING LEGAL CHALLENGES. IN ADDITION, OUR REVENUES COULD BE SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACTED BY THE TIMING

AND RATE OF COMMERCIAL ACCEPTANCE OF KEY NEW PRODUCTS, INCLUDING

SELZENTRY/CELSENTRI

AND

TOVIAZ.

SPECIALTY PHARMACEUTICALS

SPECIALTY PHARMACEUTICALS REFER TO MEDICINES THAT TREAT RARE OR LIFE-THREATENING CONDITIONS THAT HAVE SMALLER PATIENT POPULATIONS, SUCH

AS CERTAIN TYPES OF CANCER, MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS AND HIV. THE GROWING AVAILABILITY AND USE OF INNOVATIVE SPECIALTY PHARMACEUTICALS, COMBINED WITH THEIR RELATIVE HIGHER COST AS COMPARED TO OTHER TYPES OF PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS, IS BEGINNING TO

GENERATE SIGNIFICANT PAYER INTEREST IN DEVELOPING COST CONTAINMENT STRATEGIES TARGETED TO THIS SECTOR. WHILE THE IMPACT ON PFIZER OF PAYERS EFFORTS TO CONTROL ACCESS AND PRICING OF SPECIALTY PHARMACEUTICALS HAS BEEN LIMITED TO DATE, THE

COMPANYS GROWING PORTFOLIO OF SPECIALTY PRODUCTS, COMBINED WITH THE INCREASING USE OF HEALTH TECHNOLOGY ASSESSMENT IN MARKETS AROUND THE WORLD AND THE DETERIORATING FINANCES OF GOVERNMENTS, MAY LEAD TO A MORE SIGNIFICANT ADVERSE BUSINESS

IMPACT IN THE FUTURE.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT INVESTMENT

THE DISCOVERY AND DEVELOPMENT OF NEW PRODUCTS AS WELL AS THE DEVELOPMENT OF ADDITIONAL

USES FOR EXISTING PRODUCTS ARE VERY IMPORTANT TO THE SUCCESS OF THE COMPANY. HOWEVER, BALANCING CURRENT GROWTH AND INVESTMENT FOR THE FUTURE REMAINS A MAJOR CHALLENGE. OUR ONGOING INVESTMENTS IN NEW PRODUCT INTRODUCTIONS AND IN RESEARCH AND

DEVELOPMENT FOR NEW PRODUCTS AND EXISTING PRODUCT EXTENSIONS COULD EXCEED CORRESPONDING SALES GROWTH. THIS COULD PRODUCE HIGHER COSTS WITHOUT A PROPORTIONAL INCREASE IN REVENUES.

DEVELOPMENT, REGULATORY APPROVAL AND MARKETING OF PRODUCTS

RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES APPLY

PARTICULARLY WITH RESPECT TO PRODUCT-RELATED, FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS. THE OUTCOME OF THE LENGTHY AND COMPLEX PROCESS OF IDENTIFYING NEW COMPOUNDS AND DEVELOPING NEW PRODUCTS IS INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE AS TO WHETHER OR

WHEN WE WILL RECEIVE REGULATORY APPROVAL FOR NEW PRODUCTS OR FOR NEW INDICATIONS OR DOSAGE FORMS FOR EXISTING PRODUCTS. DECISIONS BY REGULATORY AUTHORITIES REGARDING LABELING AND OTHER MATTERS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE AVAILABILITY OR COMMERCIAL

POTENTIAL OF OUR PRODUCTS. THERE ALSO ARE MANY CONSIDERATIONS THAT CAN AFFECT MARKETING OF PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS AROUND THE WORLD. REGULATORY DELAYS, THE INABILITY TO SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETE CLINICAL TRIALS, CLAIMS AND CONCERNS ABOUT SAFETY AND

EFFICACY, NEW DISCOVERIES, PATENT DISPUTES AND CLAIMS ABOUT ADVERSE SIDE EFFECTS ARE A FEW OF THE FACTORS THAT COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE REALIZATION OF RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT AND PRODUCT-RELATED, FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS.

RESEARCH STUDIES

DECISIONS ABOUT RESEARCH STUDIES

MADE EARLY IN THE DEVELOPMENT PROCESS OF A DRUG CANDIDATE CAN HAVE A SUBSTANTIAL IMPACT ON THE MARKETING STRATEGY ONCE THE DRUG RECEIVES APPROVAL. MORE DETAILED STUDIES MAY DEMONSTRATE ADDITIONAL BENEFITS THAT CAN HELP IN THE MARKETING, BUT THEY

CONSUME TIME AND RESOURCES AND CAN DELAY SUBMITTING THE DRUG CANDIDATE FOR INITIAL APPROVAL. WE TRY TO PLAN CLINICAL TRIALS PRUDENTLY, BUT THERE IS NO GUARANTEE THAT A PROPER BALANCE OF SPEED AND TESTING WILL BE MADE IN EACH CASE. THE QUALITY OF OUR

DECISIONS IN THIS AREA COULD AFFECT OUR FUTURE RESULTS.

INTEREST RATE AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK

58% OF OUR TOTAL 2008 REVENUES WAS DERIVED FROM INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS, INCLUDING 31% FROM THE EUROPE REGION AND 15% FROM THE JAPAN/ASIA REGION. THESE

INTERNATIONAL-BASED REVENUES, AS WELL AS OUR SUBSTANTIAL INTERNATIONAL NET ASSETS, EXPOSE OUR REVENUES AND EARNINGS TO FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE CHANGES. IN ADDITION, OUR INTEREST-BEARING INVESTMENTS, LOANS AND BORROWINGS ARE SUBJECT TO RISK

FROM CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES. THESE RISKS AND THE MEASURES WE HAVE TAKEN TO HELP CONTAIN THEM ARE DISCUSSED IN THE SECTION ENTITLED

FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT

IN OUR 2008 FINANCIAL REPORT. FOR ADDITIONAL DETAILS,

SEE NOTE 9D TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS,

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS: DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES,

IN OUR 2008 FINANCIAL REPORT. THOSE SECTIONS OF OUR 2008 FINANCIAL REPORT ARE INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE.

NOTWITHSTANDING OUR EFFORTS TO FORESEE AND MITIGATE THE EFFECTS OF CHANGES IN FISCAL CIRCUMSTANCES, WE CANNOT PREDICT WITH CERTAINTY

CHANGES IN CURRENCY AND INTEREST RATES, INFLATION OR OTHER RELATED FACTORS AFFECTING OUR BUSINESSES.

RISKS AFFECTING INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS

OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS ALSO COULD BE AFFECTED BY CHANGES IN INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY LEGAL PROTECTIONS AND REMEDIES, TRADE

REGULATIONS AND PROCEDURES AND ACTIONS AFFECTING APPROVAL, PRODUCTION, PRICING, REIMBURSEMENT AND MARKETING OF PRODUCTS, AS WELL AS BY UNSTABLE GOVERNMENTS AND LEGAL SYSTEMS AND INTER-GOVERNMENTAL DISPUTES. ANY OF THESE CHANGES COULD ADVERSELY

AFFECT OUR BUSINESS.

GLOBAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS

THE RECENT CHANGES IN GLOBAL FINANCIAL MARKETS HAVE NOT HAD, NOR DO WE ANTICIPATE THEY WILL HAVE, A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON OUR LIQUIDITY. DUE TO OUR SIGNIFICANT OPERATING CASH FLOW, FINANCIAL ASSETS, ACCESS TO CAPITAL

MARKETS AND AVAILABLE LINES OF CREDIT AND REVOLVING CREDIT AGREEMENTS, WE CONTINUE TO BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO MEET OUR FINANCING NEEDS FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. AS MARKET CONDITIONS CHANGE, WE WILL CONTINUE TO MONITOR OUR LIQUIDITY

POSITION. HOWEVER, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT OUR LIQUIDITY OR OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS WILL NOT BE AFFECTED BY RECENT AND POSSIBLE FUTURE CHANGES IN GLOBAL FINANCIAL MARKETS AND GLOBAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS.

17

TABLE OF CONTENTS

MOREOVER, LIKE OTHER BUSINESSES, WE FACE THE POTENTIAL EFFECTS OF THE GLOBAL ECONOMIC RECESSION. UNPRECEDENTED MARKET CONDITIONS INCLUDING ILLIQUID CREDIT

MARKETS, VOLATILE EQUITY MARKETS, DRAMATIC FLUCTUATIONS IN FOREIGN CURRENCY RATES AND ECONOMIC RECESSION COULD AFFECT FUTURE RESULTS.

PRODUCT

MANUFACTURING AND MARKETING RISKS

DIFFICULTIES OR DELAYS IN PRODUCT MANUFACTURING OR MARKETING, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE

INABILITY TO INCREASE PRODUCTION CAPACITY COMMENSURATE WITH DEMAND OR THE FAILURE TO PREDICT MARKET DEMAND FOR, OR TO GAIN MARKET ACCEPTANCE OF, APPROVED PRODUCTS, COULD AFFECT FUTURE RESULTS.

COST AND EXPENSE CONTROL/UNUSUAL EVENTS

GROWTH IN

COSTS AND EXPENSES, CHANGES IN PRODUCT, SEGMENT AND GEOGRAPHIC MIX AND THE IMPACT OF ACQUISITIONS, DIVESTITURES, RESTRUCTURINGS, PRODUCT WITHDRAWALS AND OTHER UNUSUAL EVENTS THAT COULD RESULT FROM EVOLVING BUSINESS STRATEGIES, EVALUATION OF ASSET

REALIZATION AND ORGANIZATIONAL RESTRUCTURING COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT FUTURE RESULTS. SUCH RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES INCLUDE, IN PARTICULAR, OUR ABILITY TO REALIZE THE PROJECTED BENEFITS OF OUR COST-REDUCTION INITIATIVES.

CHANGES IN LAWS AND ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

OUR FUTURE

RESULTS COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY CHANGES IN LAWS AND REGULATIONS, INCLUDING CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING STANDARDS, TAXATION REQUIREMENTS (INCLUDING TAX-RATE CHANGES, NEW TAX LAWS AND REVISED TAX LAW INTERPRETATIONS), COMPETITION LAWS AND

ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS IN THE U.S. AND OTHER COUNTRIES.

TERRORIST ACTIVITY

OUR FUTURE RESULTS COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY CHANGES IN BUSINESS, POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, INCLUDING THE COST AND AVAILABILITY OF

INSURANCE, DUE TO THE THREAT OF TERRORIST ACTIVITY IN THE U.S. AND OTHER PARTS OF THE WORLD AND RELATED U.S. MILITARY ACTION OVERSEAS.

LEGAL

PROCEEDINGS

WE AND CERTAIN OF OUR SUBSIDIARIES ARE INVOLVED IN VARIOUS PATENT, PRODUCT LIABILITY, CONSUMER, COMMERCIAL, SECURITIES,

ENVIRONMENTAL AND TAX

LITIGATIONS AND CLAIMS, GOVERNMENT INVESTIGATIONS, AND OTHER LEGAL PROCEEDINGS THAT ARISE FROM TIME TO TIME IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF OUR BUSINESS.

LITIGATION IS INHERENTLY UNPREDICTABLE, AND EXCESSIVE VERDICTS DO OCCUR. ALTHOUGH WE BELIEVE WE HAVE SUBSTANTIAL DEFENSES IN THESE MATTERS, WE COULD IN THE FUTURE INCUR JUDGMENTS OR ENTER INTO SETTLEMENTS OF CLAIMS THAT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE

EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN ANY PARTICULAR PERIOD.

PATENT CLAIMS INCLUDE CHALLENGES TO THE COVERAGE AND/OR VALIDITY OF OUR

PATENTS ON VARIOUS PRODUCTS OR PROCESSES. ALTHOUGH WE BELIEVE WE HAVE SUBSTANTIAL DEFENSES TO THESE CHALLENGES WITH RESPECT TO ALL OUR MATERIAL PATENTS, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE AS TO THE OUTCOME OF THESE MATTERS, AND A LOSS IN ANY OF THESE CASES

COULD RESULT IN A LOSS OF PATENT PROTECTION FOR THE DRUG AT ISSUE, WHICH COULD LEAD TO A SIGNIFICANT LOSS OF SALES OF THAT DRUG AND COULD MATERIALLY AFFECT FUTURE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES

WE PLAN TO CONTINUE TO ENHANCE OUR IN-LINE PRODUCTS AND PRODUCT

PIPELINE THROUGH ACQUISITIONS, LICENSING AND ALLIANCES (SEE

REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT AND PIPELINE PRODUCTIVITY

UNDER

OUR OPERATING ENVIRONMENT AND RESPONSE TO KEY OPPORTUNITIES AND CHALLENGES

IN OUR 2008 FINANCIAL REPORT, WHICH IS

INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE). HOWEVER, THESE ENHANCEMENT PLANS ARE SUBJECT TO THE AVAILABILITY AND COST OF APPROPRIATE OPPORTUNITIES AND COMPETITION FROM OTHER PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES THAT ARE SEEKING SIMILAR OPPORTUNITIES.

INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY

WE RELY TO A LARGE EXTENT

UPON SOPHISTICATED INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS AND INFRASTRUCTURE. THE SIZE AND COMPLEXITY OF OUR COMPUTER SYSTEMS MAKE THEM POTENTIALLY VULNERABLE TO BREAKDOWN, MALICIOUS INTRUSION AND RANDOM ATTACK. LIKEWISE, DATA PRIVACY BREACHES BY EMPLOYEES

AND OTHERS WITH PERMITTED ACCESS TO OUR SYSTEMS MAY POSE A RISK THAT SENSITIVE DATA MAY BE EXPOSED TO UNAUTHORIZED PERSONS OR TO THE PUBLIC. WHILE WE HAVE INVESTED HEAVILY IN PROTECTION OF DATA AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE

THAT OUR EFFORTS WILL PREVENT BREAKDOWNS OR BREACHES IN OUR SYSTEMS THAT COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

RISK FACTORS RELATED TO THE PROPOSED WYETH ACQUISITION

WE MAY FAIL TO REALIZE ALL OF THE ANTICIPATED BENEFITS OF THE ACQUISITION.

THE SUCCESS OF THE ACQUISITION WILL DEPEND, IN PART, ON OUR ABILITY TO REALIZE THE ANTICIPATED BENEFITS AND COST SAVINGS FROM

COMBINING THE BUSINESSES OF PFIZER AND WYETH. HOWEVER, TO REALIZE THESE ANTICIPATED BENEFITS AND COST SAVINGS, WE MUST SUCCESSFULLY COMBINE THE BUSINESSES OF PFIZER AND WYETH. IF WE ARE NOT ABLE TO ACHIEVE THESE OBJECTIVES, THE ANTICIPATED BENEFITS

AND COST SAVINGS OF THE ACQUISITION MAY NOT BE REALIZED FULLY OR AT ALL OR MAY TAKE LONGER TO REALIZE THAN EXPECTED.

PFIZER AND WYETH HAVE

OPERATED AND, UNTIL THE COMPLETION OF THE ACQUISITION, WILL CONTINUE TO OPERATE, INDEPENDENTLY. IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE INTEGRATION PROCESS COULD RESULT IN THE LOSS OF KEY EMPLOYEES, THE DISRUPTION OF EACH COMPANYS ONGOING BUSINESSES OR

INCONSISTENCIES IN STANDARDS, CONTROLS, PROCEDURES AND POLICIES THAT ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO MAINTAIN RELATIONSHIPS WITH CUSTOMERS, SUPPLIERS, DISTRIBUTORS, CREDITORS, LESSORS, CLINICAL TRIAL INVESTIGATORS OR MANAGERS OF ITS CLINICAL TRIALS

OR TO ACHIEVE THE ANTICIPATED BENEFITS OF THE ACQUISITION. INTEGRATION EFFORTS BETWEEN THE TWO COMPANIES WILL ALSO DIVERT MANAGEMENT ATTENTION AND RESOURCES. THESE INTEGRATION MATTERS COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON EACH OF WYETH AND PFIZER DURING

SUCH TRANSITION PERIOD.

FAILURE TO COMPLETE THE ACQUISITION COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR STOCK PRICE AND OUR FUTURE BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL RESULTS .

IF THE ACQUISITION IS NOT COMPLETED OR OUR FINANCING FOR THE TRANSACTION BECOMES UNAVAILABLE, OUR ONGOING BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL

RESULTS MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED AND WE WILL BE SUBJECT TO A NUMBER OF RISKS, INCLUDING THE FOLLOWING.



IF OUR FINANCING FOR THE ACQUISITION BECOMES UNAVAILABLE, WE WILL, UNDER CIRCUMSTANCES SPECIFIED IN THE MERGER AGREEMENT, BE REQUIRED TO PAY SIGNIFICANT LIQUIDATED

DAMAGES TO WYETH OR BE COMPELLED TO TAKE CERTAIN ACTIONS TO SPECIFICALLY PERFORM OUR OBLIGATION TO CONSUMMATE THE ACQUISITION;



WE WILL BE REQUIRED TO PAY CERTAIN COSTS RELATING TO THE ACQUISITION, WHETHER OR NOT THE ACQUISITION IS COMPLETED;



MATTERS RELATING TO THE ACQUISITION (INCLUDING INTEGRATION PLANNING) MAY REQUIRE SUBSTANTIAL COMMITMENTS OF TIME AND RESOURCES BY OUR MANAGEMENT, WHICH COULD

OTHERWISE HAVE BEEN DEVOTED TO OTHER OPPORTUNITIES THAT MAY HAVE BEEN BENEFICIAL TO US.

WE COULD ALSO BE SUBJECT TO

LITIGATION RELATED TO ANY FAILURE TO COMPLETE THE ACQUISITION. IF THE ACQUISITION IS NOT COMPLETED, THESE RISKS MAY MATERIALIZE AND MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL RESULTS AND STOCK PRICE.

THE REQUIRED REGULATORY APPROVALS MAY NOT BE OBTAINED OR MAY CONTAIN MATERIALLY BURDENSOME CONDITIONS THAT COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON US.

COMPLETION OF THE ACQUISITION IS CONDITIONED UPON THE RECEIPT OF CERTAIN GOVERNMENTAL APPROVALS, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE EXPIRATION OR

TERMINATION OF THE APPLICABLE WAITING PERIOD UNDER THE HART-SCOTT-RODINO ACT, THE ISSUANCE BY THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION OF A DECISION UNDER THE EC MERGER REGULATION DECLARING THE ACQUISITION COMPATIBLE WITH THE COMMON MARKET, THE APPROVAL OF THE

ACQUISITION UNDER THE CHINA ANTI-MONOPOLY LAW AND THE APPROVAL OF THE ACQUISITION BY THE ANTITRUST REGULATORS IN CANADA AND AUSTRALIA. ALTHOUGH PFIZER AND WYETH HAVE AGREED IN THE MERGER AGREEMENT TO USE THEIR REASONABLE BEST EFFORTS TO OBTAIN THE

REQUISITE GOVERNMENTAL APPROVALS, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THESE APPROVALS WILL BE OBTAINED. IN ADDITION, THE GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORITIES FROM WHICH THESE APPROVALS ARE REQUIRED MAY IMPOSE CONDITIONS ON THE COMPLETION OF THE ACQUISITION OR

REQUIRE CHANGES TO THE TERMS OF THE ACQUISITION. UNDER THE TERMS OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT, WE ARE REQUIRED, IF NECESSARY TO RECEIVE ANTITRUST APPROVAL, TO MAKE DIVESTITURES OF ASSETS SO LONG AS SUCH DIVESTITURES WOULD NOT RESULT IN THE ONE-YEAR LOSS

OF NET SALES (MEASURED BY NET 2008 SALES REVENUE) IN EXCESS OF $3 BILLION. IF WE BECOME SUBJECT TO ANY MATERIAL CONDITIONS IN ORDER TO OBTAIN ANY APPROVALS REQUIRED TO COMPLETE THE ACQUISITION, OUR BUSINESS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS MAY BE ADVERSELY

AFFECTED.

WE WILL TAKE ON SUBSTANTIAL ADDITIONAL INDEBTEDNESS TO FINANCE THE ACQUISITION.

UPON COMPLETION OF THE ACQUISITION, WE WILL INCREASE OUR INDEBTEDNESS WHICH WILL INCLUDE ACQUISITION DEBT FINANCING OF APPROXIMATELY $22.5 BILLION AND THE

ASSUMPTION OF WYETHS DEBT

19

TABLE OF CONTENTS

OBLIGATIONS. THE FINANCIAL AND OTHER COVENANTS THAT WE AGREE TO IN CONNECTION WITH SUCH INDEBTEDNESS AND OUR INCREASED INDEBTEDNESS AND HIGHER DEBT-TO-EQUITY

RATIO IN COMPARISON TO THAT OF PFIZER ON A RECENT HISTORICAL BASIS COULD, AMONG OTHER THINGS, REDUCE OUR FLEXIBILITY TO RESPOND TO CHANGING BUSINESS AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND INCREASE OUR BORROWING COSTS.

WE WILL INCUR SIGNIFICANT TRANSACTION AND ACQUISITION-RELATED COSTS IN CONNECTION WITH THE ACQUISITION.

WE EXPECT TO INCUR A NUMBER OF NON-RECURRING COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH INTEGRATING THE OPERATIONS OF WYETH. THE SUBSTANTIAL MAJORITY OF NON-RECURRING EXPENSES

RESULTING FROM THE ACQUISITION WILL BE COMPRISED OF TRANSACTION COSTS RELATED TO THE ACQUISITION, FACILITIES AND SYSTEMS CONSOLIDATION COSTS AND EMPLOYMENTRELATED COSTS. WE WILL ALSO INCUR TRANSACTION FEES AND COSTS RELATED TO FORMULATING

INTEGRATION PLANS. ADDITIONAL UNANTICIPATED COSTS MAY BE INCURRED IN THE INTEGRATION OF WYETHS BUSINESS. ALTHOUGH WE EXPECT THAT THE ELIMINATION OF DUPLICATIVE COSTS, AS WELL AS THE REALIZATION OF OTHER EFFICIENCIES RELATED TO THE INTEGRATION

OF THE BUSINESSES, SHOULD ALLOW US TO MORE THAN OFFSET INCREMENTAL TRANSACTION AND ACQUISITION-RELATED COSTS OVER TIME, THIS NET BENEFIT MAY NOT BE ACHIEVED IN THE NEAR TERM, OR AT ALL.

THE MERGER MAY NOT BE ACCRETIVE AND MAY CAUSE DILUTION TO OUR EARNINGS PER SHARE, WHICH MAY HARM THE MARKET PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK.

WE CURRENTLY ANTICIPATE THAT THE MERGER WILL BE ACCRETIVE TO EARNINGS PER SHARE DURING THE CALENDAR YEAR 2011. THIS EXPECTATION IS BASED ON PRELIMINARY

ESTIMATES WHICH MAY MATERIALLY CHANGE AFTER THE COMPLETION OF THE MERGER. WE COULD ALSO ENCOUNTER ADDITIONAL TRANSACTION AND INTEGRATION-RELATED COSTS OR OTHER FACTORS SUCH AS THE FAILURE TO REALIZE ALL OF THE BENEFITS ANTICIPATED IN THE MERGER. ALL

OF THESE FACTORS COULD CAUSE DILUTION TO OUR EARNINGS PER SHARE OR DECREASE OR DELAY THE EXPECTED ACCRETIVE EFFECT OF THE MERGER AND CAUSE A DECREASE IN THE PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK.

CHARGES TO EARNINGS

RESULTING FROM THE APPLICATION OF THE PURCHASE METHOD OF ACCOUNTING MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE MARKET VALUE OF OUR COMMON STOCK FOLLOWING THE MERGER.

IN ACCORDANCE WITH U.S. GAAP, WE WILL BE CONSIDERED THE ACQUIRER FOR ACCOUNTING PURPOSES. WE WILL ACCOUNT FOR THE MERGER USING THE PURCHASE METHOD OF ACCOUNTING, WHICH WILL RESULT IN CHARGES TO OUR EARNINGS THAT COULD

ADVERSELY AFFECT THE MARKET VALUE OF OUR COMMON STOCK FOLLOWING THE COMPLETION OF THE MERGER. UNDER THE PURCHASE METHOD OF ACCOUNTING, WE WILL ALLOCATE THE TOTAL PURCHASE PRICE TO THE ASSETS ACQUIRED AND LIABILITIES ASSUMED FROM WYETH BASED ON THEIR

FAIR VALUES AS OF THE DATE OF THE COMPLETION OF THE MERGER, AND RECORD ANY EXCESS OF THE PURCHASE PRICE OVER THOSE FAIR VALUES AS GOODWILL. FOR CERTAIN TANGIBLE AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS, REEVALUATING THEIR FAIR VALUES AS OF THE COMPLETION DATE OF THE

MERGER WILL RESULT IN OUR INCURRING ADDITIONAL DEPRECIATION AND/OR AMORTIZATION EXPENSE THAT EXCEED THE COMBINED AMOUNTS RECORDED BY PFIZER AND WYETH PRIOR TO THE MERGER. THIS INCREASED EXPENSE WILL BE RECORDED BY US OVER THE USEFUL LIVES OF THE

UNDERLYING ASSETS. IN ADDITION, TO THE EXTENT THE VALUE OF GOODWILL OR INTANGIBLE ASSETS WERE TO BECOME IMPAIRED, WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO INCUR CHARGES RELATING TO THE IMPAIRMENT OF THOSE ASSETS.

WYETH FACES LITIGATION RISKS AND IS THE SUBJECT OF VARIOUS LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.

IF WE CONSUMMATE OUR ACQUISITION OF WYETH, WE WILL ASSUME WYETHS RISKS ARISING FROM LEGAL PROCEEDINGS. LIKE ALL PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES IN THE CURRENT LEGAL ENVIRONMENT, WYETH IS INVOLVED IN VARIOUS PATENT,

PRODUCT LIABILITY, CONSUMER, COMMERCIAL, SECURITIES, ENVIRONMENTAL AND TAX LITIGATIONS AND CLAIMS, GOVERNMENT INVESTIGATIONS, AND OTHER LEGAL PROCEEDINGS THAT ARISE FROM TIME TO TIME IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF ITS BUSINESS. WE CANNOT PREDICT WITH

CERTAINTY THE EVENTUAL OUTCOME OF WYETHS PENDING OR FUTURE LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND THE ULTIMATE OUTCOME OF SUCH MATTERS COULD BE MATERIAL TO OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, CASH FLOWS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.
