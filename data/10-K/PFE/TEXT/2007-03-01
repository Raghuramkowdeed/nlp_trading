GENERAL

PFIZER INC. (WHICH MAY BE REFERRED TO AS

PFIZER, THE COMPANY, WE, US

OR

OUR

) IS A RESEARCH-BASED, GLOBAL PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANY. WE DISCOVER, DEVELOP, MANUFACTURE AND MARKET LEADING PRESCRIPTION MEDICINES FOR HUMANS AND ANIMALS.

THE COMPANY WAS INCORPORATED UNDER THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE ON JUNE 2, 1942.

WE ACQUIRED PHARMACIA CORPORATION (PHARMACIA) IN APRIL 2003. THE ACQUISITION WAS ACCOUNTED FOR AS A PURCHASE. IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP, WE DID NOT RESTATE OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL

POSITION TO REFLECT THE HISTORICAL RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL POSITION OF PHARMACIA.

WE ACQUIRED ESPERION THERAPEUTICS, INC. (ESPERION) IN FEBRUARY 2004. THE ACQUISITION WAS ACCOUNTED FOR AS A PURCHASE. ESPERION IS A BIOPHARMACEUTICAL COMPANY FOCUSED ON THE

DEVELOPMENT OF HIGH DENSITY LIPOPROTEIN (HDL)-TARGETED (GOOD CHOLESTEROL) THERAPIES FOR THE TREATMENT OF CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE.

IN SEPTEMBER 2005, WE ACQUIRED VICURON PHARMACEUTICALS, INC., A BIOPHARMACEUTICAL COMPANY FOCUSED ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF NOVEL ANTI-INFECTIVES. THE ACQUISITION WAS ALSO ACCOUNTED FOR AS A

PURCHASE.

WE ACQUIRED THE WORLDWIDE RIGHTS TO

EXUBERA

(INHALED INSULATION THERAPY) FROM SANOFI-AVENTIS IN FEBRUARY 2006. THE

COMPANY AND SANOFI-AVENTIS WERE PREVIOUSLY IN A WORLDWIDE ALLIANCE TO CO-DEVELOP, CO-PROMOTE AND CO-MANUFACTURE

EXUBERA

. THE COMPANY ALSO ACQUIRED THE SANOFI-AVENTIS RIGHTS TO

THE

BUSINESS SEGMENTS

WE OPERATE IN TWO BUSINESS SEGMENTS: PHARMACEUTICAL AND ANIMAL HEALTH.

WE ALSO OPERATE SEVERAL OTHER BUSINESSES, INCLUDING THE MANUFACTURE OF EMPTY SOFT-GELATIN CAPSULES, CONTRACT MANUFACTURING AND BULK PHARMACEUTICAL CHEMICALS. DUE TO THE SIZE OF THESE

BUSINESSES, THEY ARE GROUPED INTO THE CORPORATE/OTHER CATEGORY OF OUR SEGMENT INFORMATION.

LABELING. SIMILAR REGULATIONS EXIST IN MOST OTHER COUNTRIES, AND IN MANY COUNTRIES

THE GOVERNMENT ALSO REGULATES OUR PRICES. SEE

ANIMAL HEALTH

OUR ANIMAL HEALTH BUSINESS

IS ONE OF THE LARGEST IN THE WORLD. WE DISCOVER, DEVELOP AND SELL PRODUCTS FOR

THE PREVENTION AND TREATMENT OF DISEASES IN LIVESTOCK AND COMPANION ANIMALS.

IN 2006,  ANIMAL HEALTH REVENUES INCREASED 5%, TO $2.3 BILLION, PRIMARILY

DUE TO THE CONTINUED PERFORMANCE OF

DRAXXIN

(SINGLE

DOSE ANTI-INFECTIVE FOR CATTLE AND SWINE) IN EUROPE AND  THE U.S. AND

REVOLUTION

PARASITICIDE FOR DOGS AND CATS). REVENUES FROM THIS SEGMENT CONTRIBUTED 4.8%

OF OUR TOTAL REVENUES IN 2006, 4.6% OF OUR TOTAL REVENUES IN 2005 AND  4.0% OF

OUR TOTAL REVENUES IN 2004.

AMONG THE PRODUCTS WE MARKET ARE PARASITICIDES, ANTI-INFLAMMATORIES, VACCINES, ANTIBIOTICS AND RELATED MEDICINES, INCLUDING THE PRODUCTS DISCUSSED BELOW.

PARASITICIDES CONSTITUTE THE LARGEST SEGMENT OF THE ANIMAL HEALTH MARKET FOR COMPANION ANIMALS, CONSISTING MAINLY OF MEDICINES FOR THE CONTROL OF PARASITES SUCH AS FLEAS AND HEARTWORM. OUR

NAXCEL/EXCENEL RTU

RESEARCH AND PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT

INNOVATION BY OUR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT OPERATIONS IS VERY IMPORTANT TO THE COMPANYS SUCCESS. OUR GOAL IS TO DISCOVER, DEVELOP AND BRING TO MARKET INNOVATIVE PRODUCTS THAT ADDRESS

MAJOR UNMET MEDICAL NEEDS. THIS GOAL HAS BEEN SUPPORTED BY OUR SUBSTANTIAL RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT INVESTMENTS. WE SPENT $7.6 BILLION IN 2006, $7.3 BILLION IN 2005 AND $7.5 BILLION IN 2004 ON RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT IN SUPPORT OF

PFIZERS PHARMACEUTICAL AND ANIMAL HEALTH BUSINESSES.

WE CONDUCT RESEARCH INTERNALLY AND ALSO THROUGH CONTRACTS WITH THIRD PARTIES, THROUGH COLLABORATIONS WITH UNIVERSITIES AND BIOTECHNOLOGY COMPANIES AND IN COOPERATION WITH OTHER PHARMACEUTICAL

FIRMS. WE ALSO SEEK OUT PROMISING COMPOUNDS AND INNOVATIVE TECHNOLOGIES DEVELOPED BY THIRD PARTIES TO INCORPORATE INTO OUR DISCOVERY OR DEVELOPMENT PROCESSES OR PROJECTS, AS WELL AS OUR PRODUCT LINES, THROUGH ACQUISITION, LICENSING OR OTHER

ARRANGEMENTS.

DRUG DISCOVERY AND DEVELOPMENT IS TIME CONSUMING, EXPENSIVE AND UNPREDICTABLE. ON AVERAGE, ONLY ONE OUT OF MANY THOUSANDS OF CHEMICAL COMPOUNDS DISCOVERED BY RESEARCHERS PROVES TO BE BOTH

MEDICALLY EFFECTIVE AND SAFE ENOUGH TO BECOME AN APPROVED MEDICINE. THE PROCESS FROM EARLY DISCOVERY TO DEVELOPMENT TO REGULATORY APPROVAL CAN TAKE MORE THAN TEN YEARS. DRUG CANDIDATES CAN FAIL AT ANY STAGE OF THE PROCESS. CANDIDATES MAY NOT RECEIVE REGULATORY APPROVAL EVEN AFTER MANY YEARS OF

RESEARCH.

WE BELIEVE THAT OUR INVESTMENTS IN RESEARCH HAVE BEEN REWARDED BY THE NUMBER OF PHARMACEUTICAL COMPOUNDS WE HAVE IN ALL STAGES OF DEVELOPMENT. WE CURRENTLY ARE WORKING ON 249 PROJECTS IN

DEVELOPMENT, INCLUDING 177 NEW MOLECULAR ENTITIES AND 72 PRODUCT-LINE EXTENSIONS. IN ADDITION, WE HAVE MORE THAN 350 PROJECTS IN DISCOVERY RESEARCH. IN RECENT YEARS, OUR DISCOVERY SCIENTISTS HAVE DELIVERED OVER 100 NEW CHEMICAL COMPOUNDS TO EARLY

DEVELOPMENT. WHILE THESE NEW CANDIDATES MAY OR MAY NOT EVENTUALLY RECEIVE REGULATORY APPROVAL, NEW DRUG CANDIDATES ENTERING DEVELOPMENT ARE THE FOUNDATION FOR FUTURE PRODUCTS.

IN ADDITION TO DISCOVERING AND DEVELOPING NEW PRODUCTS, OUR RESEARCH OPERATIONS ADD VALUE TO OUR EXISTING PRODUCTS BY IMPROVING THEIR EFFECTIVENESS AND BY DISCOVERING NEW USES FOR THEM.

INFORMATION CONCERNING SEVERAL OF OUR DRUG CANDIDATES IN DEVELOPMENT AS WELL AS SUPPLEMENTAL FILINGS FOR EXISTING PRODUCTS IS SET FORTH UNDER THE HEADING

PRODUCT DEVELOPMENTS

IN OUR 2006 FINANCIAL REPORT. THAT INFORMATION IS INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE.

PFIZER RECENTLY PROVIDED MORE DETAIL ON ITS PIPELINE THAN EVER BEFORE WITH THE LAUNCH OF AN ON-LINE SITE FOR TRACKING DEVELOPMENT COMPOUNDS ACROSS PFIZERS LARGEST-EVER PIPELINE. THIS NEW

WEBSITE, LAUNCHED IN DECEMBER 2006, WILL BE UPDATED TWICE A YEAR AND IS AVAILABLE AT HTTP://WWW.PFIZER.COM/PIPELINE.

OUR COMPETITORS ALSO DEVOTE SUBSTANTIAL FUNDS AND RESOURCES TO RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT. IN ADDITION, THE CONSOLIDATION THAT HAS OCCURRED IN OUR INDUSTRY HAS CREATED COMPANIES WITH SUBSTANTIAL

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT RESOURCES. WE ALSO COMPETE AGAINST NUMEROUS SMALL BIOTECHNOLOGY COMPANIES IN DEVELOPING POTENTIAL DRUG CANDIDATES. THE EXTENT TO WHICH OUR COMPETITORS ARE SUCCESSFUL IN THEIR RESEARCH COULD RESULT IN EROSION OF THE SALES OF

OUR PRODUCTS AND UNANTICIPATED PRODUCT OBSOLESCENCE.

2006. THE U.S. WAS THE ONLY COUNTRY TO CONTRIBUTE MORE THAN 10% OF OUR TOTAL REVENUES, COMPRISING 53.4% OF TOTAL REVENUES IN 2006, 52.2% OF TOTAL REVENUES IN 2005 AND 56.7% OF TOTAL REVENUES IN 2004. JAPAN IS OUR SECOND-LARGEST NATIONAL MARKET, WITH

6.7% OF OUR REVENUES IN 2006, 7.3% IN 2005 AND 6.4% IN 2004.

IN OUR 2006 FINANCIAL REPORT. THOSE TABLES ARE INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE.

OUR INTERNATIONAL BUSINESSES ARE SUBJECT, IN VARYING DEGREES, TO A NUMBER OF RISKS INHERENT IN CARRYING ON BUSINESS IN OTHER COUNTRIES. THESE INCLUDE CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS, CAPITAL AND EXCHANGE

CONTROL REGULATIONS, EXPROPRIATION AND OTHER RESTRICTIVE GOVERNMENT ACTIONS. OUR INTERNATIONAL BUSINESSES ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO GOVERNMENT-IMPOSED CONSTRAINTS, INCLUDING LAWS ON PRICING, REIMBURSEMENT AND ACCESS TO OUR PRODUCTS.

SEE

GOVERNMENT REGULATION AND PRICE CONSTRAINTS

BELOW FOR DISCUSSION OF THESE MATTERS.

DEPENDING ON THE DIRECTION OF CHANGE RELATIVE TO THE U.S. DOLLAR, FOREIGN CURRENCY VALUES CAN INCREASE OR DECREASE THE REPORTED DOLLAR VALUE OF OUR NET ASSETS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. IN

2006, REVENUES WERE UNFAVORABLY IMPACTED BY FOREIGN EXCHANGE, AS FOREIGN CURRENCY MOVEMENTS RELATIVE TO THE U.S. DOLLAR DECREASED OUR REPORTED REVENUES IN MANY COUNTRIES. WHILE WE CANNOT PREDICT WITH CERTAINTY FUTURE CHANGES IN FOREIGN EXCHANGE

RATES OR THE EFFECT THEY WILL HAVE ON US, WE ATTEMPT TO MITIGATE THEIR IMPACT THROUGH OPERATIONAL MEANS AND BY USING VARIOUS FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS. SEE THE DISCUSSION UNDER NOTE 9-D TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS,

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS: DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES

IN

OUR 2006 FINANCIAL REPORT. THAT DISCUSSION IS INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE. RELATED INFORMATION ABOUT VALUATION AND RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH SUCH FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS IN PARTS E AND F OF THAT SAME NOTE IS ALSO INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE.

MARKETING

IN OUR GLOBAL PHARMACEUTICAL BUSINESS, WE PROMOTE OUR PRODUCTS TO HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS AND PATIENTS. THROUGH OUR MARKETING ORGANIZATIONS, WE EXPLAIN THE APPROVED USES, BENEFITS AND RISKS OF OUR

PRODUCTS TO HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS, SUCH AS DOCTORS, NURSE PRACTITIONERS, PHYSICIAN ASSISTANTS, PHARMACISTS, HOSPITALS, PHARMACY BENEFIT MANAGERS (PBMS), MANAGED CARE ORGANIZATIONS (MCOS) AND GOVERNMENT AGENCIES. WE ALSO MARKET DIRECTLY TO CONSUMERS

IN THE U.S., THROUGH DIRECT-TO-CONSUMER PRINT AND TELEVISION ADVERTISING THAT COMMUNICATES THE APPROVED USES, BENEFITS, AND RISKS OF OUR PRODUCTS WHILE CONTINUING TO MOTIVATE PEOPLE TO HAVE MEANINGFUL CONVERSATIONS WITH THEIR DOCTORS. IN ADDITION,

WE SPONSOR GENERAL ADVERTISING TO EDUCATE THE PUBLIC ON DISEASE AWARENESS, IMPORTANT PUBLIC HEALTH ISSUES, AND OUR PATIENT ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS IN ALL MAJOR MARKETS.

OUR OPERATIONS INCLUDE SEVERAL PHARMACEUTICAL SALES ORGANIZATIONS. OUR STRUCTURE ALIGNS THE SALES, MARKETING, AND MEDICAL FUNCTIONS TO WORK CLOSELY IN TANDEM ALONG THE SAME THERAPEUTIC GROUPS

OF PRODUCTS, REINFORCING COMMON COORDINATION, FOCUS, AND ACCOUNTABILITY ACROSS THE ORGANIZATIONS.

OUR PRESCRIPTION PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS ARE SOLD PRINCIPALLY TO WHOLESALERS, BUT WE ALSO SELL DIRECTLY TO RETAILERS, HOSPITALS, CLINICS, GOVERNMENT AGENCIES AND PHARMACIES. WE SEEK TO GAIN

ACCESS TO HEALTH AUTHORITY, PBM AND MCO FORMULARIES (LISTS OF RECOMMENDED, APPROVED, AND/OR REIMBURSED MEDICINES AND OTHER PRODUCTS) BY DEMONSTRATING THE CLINICAL AND ECONOMIC VALUE OF OUR PRODUCTS. WE ALSO WORK WITH MCOS AND PBMS AND OTHER

APPROPRIATE HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS TO ASSIST THEM WITH DISEASE MANAGEMENT, PATIENT EDUCATION AND OTHER TOOLS THAT HELP THEIR MEDICAL TREATMENT ROUTINES. IN 2005, FOR INSTANCE, WE WERE AWARDED A CENTER FOR MEDICARE/MEDICAID STUDIES (CMS)

CONTRACT TO PROVIDE THE GREEN RIBBON HEALTH INITIATIVE, A JOINT-PARTNERSHIP WITH THE MCO

6

HUMANA DESIGNED TO IMPROVE THE HEALTH AND QUALITY OF LIFE FOR BENEFICIARIES WITH MULTIPLE CHRONIC CONDITIONS IN CENTRAL FLORIDA.

OUR ANIMAL HEALTH BUSINESS ALSO USES ITS OWN SALES ORGANIZATION TO PROMOTE ITS PRODUCTS. ITS ADVERTISING AND PROMOTION ARE GENERALLY TARGETED TO HEALTH PROFESSIONALS, DIRECTLY AND THROUGH

VETERINARY JOURNALS. ANIMAL HEALTH PRODUCTS ARE SOLD THROUGH VETERINARIANS, DISTRIBUTORS AND RETAIL OUTLETS AS WELL AS DIRECTLY TO USERS. WHERE APPROPRIATE, THESE PRODUCTS ARE ALSO MARKETED THROUGH PRINT AND TELEVISION ADVERTISING.

DURING 2006, SALES TO OUR THREE LARGEST CUSTOMERS WERE AS FOLLOWS.

MCKESSON, INC.20% OF OUR TOTAL REVENUES;

CARDINAL HEALTH, INC.13% OF OUR TOTAL

REVENUES; AND

AMERISOURCEBERGEN CORPORATION11% OF OUR

TOTAL REVENUES.

SALES TO THESE WHOLESALERS WERE CONCENTRATED IN THE PHARMACEUTICAL SEGMENT. APART FROM THESE INSTANCES, NEITHER OF OUR BUSINESS SEGMENTS IS DEPENDENT ON ANY ONE CUSTOMER OR GROUP OF RELATED

CUSTOMERS.

PATENTS AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS

OUR PRODUCTS ARE SOLD AROUND THE WORLD UNDER BRAND-NAME, LOGO AND CERTAIN PRODUCT DESIGN TRADEMARKS THAT WE CONSIDER IN THE AGGREGATE TO BE OF MATERIAL IMPORTANCE. TRADEMARK PROTECTION

CONTINUES IN SOME COUNTRIES FOR AS LONG AS THE MARK IS USED AND, IN OTHER COUNTRIES, FOR AS LONG AS IT IS REGISTERED. REGISTRATIONS GENERALLY ARE FOR FIXED, BUT RENEWABLE, TERMS.

WE OWN OR LICENSE A NUMBER OF U.S. AND FOREIGN PATENTS. THESE PATENTS COVER PHARMACEUTICAL AND OTHER PRODUCTS AND THEIR USES, PHARMACEUTICAL FORMULATIONS, PRODUCT MANUFACTURING PROCESSES AND

INTERMEDIATE CHEMICAL COMPOUNDS USED IN MANUFACTURING.

PATENTS FOR INDIVIDUAL PRODUCTS EXTEND FOR VARYING PERIODS ACCORDING TO THE DATE OF PATENT FILING OR GRANT AND THE LEGAL TERM OF PATENTS IN THE VARIOUS COUNTRIES WHERE PATENT PROTECTION IS

OBTAINED. THE ACTUAL PROTECTION AFFORDED BY A PATENT, WHICH CAN VARY FROM COUNTRY TO COUNTRY, DEPENDS UPON THE TYPE OF PATENT, THE SCOPE OF ITS COVERAGE AND THE AVAILABILITY OF LEGAL REMEDIES IN THE COUNTRY.

IN THE AGGREGATE, OUR PATENT AND RELATED RIGHTS ARE OF MATERIAL IMPORTANCE TO OUR BUSINESSES IN THE U.S. AND MOST OTHER COUNTRIES. BASED ON CURRENT PRODUCT SALES, AND CONSIDERING THE VIGOROUS

COMPETITION WITH PRODUCTS SOLD BY OTHERS, THE PATENT RIGHTS WE CONSIDER SIGNIFICANT IN RELATION TO OUR BUSINESS AS A WHOLE, TOGETHER WITH THE YEAR IN WHICH THE U.S. BASIC PRODUCT PATENT EXPIRES (INCLUDING, WHERE APPLICABLE, THE ADDITIONAL SIX-MONTH

PEDIATRIC EXCLUSIVITY PERIOD), ARE THOSE FOR THE DRUGS SET FORTH IN THE TABLE BELOW. THE TABLE ALSO INCLUDES PATENT EXPIRATION INFORMATION RELATING TO CERTAIN RECENTLY APPROVED DRUGS.

IN SOME INSTANCES, THERE ARE LATER-EXPIRING PATENTS RELATING TO OUR PRODUCTS DIRECTED TO PARTICULAR FORMS OR COMPOSITIONS OF THE DRUG OR TO METHODS OF MANUFACTURING OR USING THE DRUG IN THE

TREATMENT OF PARTICULAR DISEASES OR CONDITIONS. HOWEVER, IN SOME CASES, SUCH PATENTS MAY NOT PROTECT THE COMPANYS DRUG FROM GENERIC COMPETITION AFTER THE EXPIRATION OF THE BASIC PATENT.

AS A PRESCRIPTION MEDICINE IN THE U.S. WITH A SUBSIDIARY OF UCB S.A. THE U.S. BASIC PATENT FOR

ZYRTEC

EXPIRES IN DECEMBER 2007.

IN ADDITION TO OUR U.S. BASIC PRODUCT PATENT FOR

LIPITOR,

WHICH

(INCLUDING THE PEDIATRIC EXCLUSIVITY PERIOD) EXPIRES IN MARCH 2010, WE HAVE A

PATENT COVERING SPECIFICALLY THE ENANTIOMERIC FORM OF THE DRUG, WHICH (INCLUDING

THE PEDIATRIC EXCLUSIVITY PERIOD) EXPIRES IN JUNE 2011. SEE NOTE 19 TO OUR CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS,

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND CONTINGENCIES,

IN THE U.S.

WE MARKET

GENOTROPIN

IN THE U.S. UNDER A NON-EXCLUSIVE LICENSE FROM NOVO-NORDISK.

COMPANIES HAVE FILED APPLICATIONS WITH THE FDA SEEKING APPROVAL OF PRODUCTS THAT WE BELIEVE INFRINGE OUR PATENTS COVERING, AMONG OTHER PRODUCTS,

LIPITOR,

NORVASC, CELEBREX

AND

DETROL.

WE ALSO HAVE OTHER PATENT RIGHTS COVERING ADDITIONAL PRODUCTS THAT HAVE LESSER REVENUES.

THE EXPIRATION OF A BASIC PRODUCT PATENT OR LOSS OF PATENT PROTECTION RESULTING FROM A LEGAL CHALLENGE NORMALLY RESULTS IN SIGNIFICANT COMPETITION FROM GENERIC PRODUCTS AGAINST THE ORIGINALLY

PATENTED PRODUCT AND CAN RESULT IN A SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN SALES OF THAT PRODUCT IN A VERY SHORT PERIOD. IN SOME CASES, HOWEVER, WE CAN CONTINUE TO OBTAIN COMMERCIAL BENEFITS FROM PRODUCT MANUFACTURING TRADE SECRETS; PATENTS ON USES FOR PRODUCTS;

PATENTS ON PROCESSES AND INTERMEDIATES FOR THE ECONOMICAL MANUFACTURE OF THE ACTIVE INGREDIENTS; PATENTS FOR SPECIAL FORMULATIONS OF THE PRODUCT OR DELIVERY MECHANISMS; AND CONVERSION OF THE ACTIVE INGREDIENT TO OVER-THE-COUNTER PRODUCTS.

ONE OF THE MAIN LIMITATIONS ON OUR OPERATIONS IN SOME COUNTRIES OUTSIDE THE U.S. IS THE LACK OF EFFECTIVE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY PROTECTION FOR OUR PRODUCTS. UNDER INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS IN

RECENT YEARS, GLOBAL PROTECTION OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS IS IMPROVING. THE GENERAL AGREEMENT ON TARIFFS AND TRADE REQUIRES PARTICIPANT COUNTRIES TO AMEND THEIR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY LAWS TO PROVIDE PATENT PROTECTION FOR PHARMACEUTICAL

PRODUCTS BY THE END OF A TEN-YEAR TRANSITION PERIOD. A NUMBER OF COUNTRIES ARE DOING THIS. WE HAVE EXPERIENCED SIGNIFICANT GROWTH IN OUR BUSINESSES IN SOME OF THOSE NATIONS, AND OUR CONTINUED BUSINESS EXPANSION IN THOSE COUNTRIES DEPENDS TO A LARGE

DEGREE ON FURTHER PATENT PROTECTION IMPROVEMENT.

COMPETITION

OUR BUSINESSES ARE CONDUCTED IN INTENSELY COMPETITIVE AND OFTEN HIGHLY REGULATED MARKETS. MANY OF OUR HUMAN PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS FACE COMPETITION IN THE FORM OF BRANDED DRUGS OR GENERIC

DRUGS THAT TREAT SIMILAR DISEASES OR INDICATIONS. THE PRINCIPAL FORMS OF COMPETITION INCLUDE EFFICACY, SAFETY, EASE OF USE, AND COST EFFECTIVENESS. THOUGH THE MEANS OF COMPETITION VARY AMONG PRODUCT CATEGORIES AND BUSINESS GROUPS, DEMONSTRATING THE

VALUE OF OUR PRODUCTS IS A CRITICAL FACTOR FOR SUCCESS IN ALL OF OUR PRINCIPAL BUSINESSES.

OUR PHARMACEUTICAL BUSINESS IS THE LARGEST IN THE WORLD. OUR COMPETITORS INCLUDE OTHER WORLDWIDE RESEARCH-BASED DRUG COMPANIES, SMALLER RESEARCH COMPANIES WITH MORE LIMITED THERAPEUTIC FOCUS,

AND GENERIC DRUG MANUFACTURERS. WE COMPETE WITH OTHER COMPANIES THAT MANUFACTURE AND SELL PRODUCTS THAT TREAT SIMILAR DISEASES OR INDICATIONS AS OUR MAJOR PRODUCTS.

SUCH COMPETITION AFFECTS OUR CORE PRODUCT INNOVATION BUSINESS, FOCUSED ON DISCOVERING AND MARKETING PRODUCTS THAT SATISFY UNMET MEDICAL NEEDS AND PROVIDING THERAPEUTIC IMPROVEMENTS. OUR

EMPHASIS ON INNOVATION IS UNDERSCORED BY OUR MULTI-BILLION-DOLLAR INVESTMENT IN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT OVER THE PAST DECADE, RESULTING IN ONE OF THE STRONGEST PRODUCT PIPELINES IN THE INDUSTRY. OUR INVESTMENT IN RESEARCH DOES NOT STOP WITH A DRUG

APPROVAL; WE CONTINUE TO INVEST IN FURTHER UNDERSTANDING THE VALUE OF OUR PRODUCTS FOR THE CONDITIONS THEY TREAT AS WELL AS POTENTIALLY NEW CONDITIONS. WE ALSO CONTINUE TO ENHANCE THE ORGANIZATIONAL EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR PHARMACEUTICAL SALES AND

MARKETING FUNCTIONS, COORDINATING SUPPORT FOR OUR SALESPEOPLES EFFORTS TO LAUNCH AND PROMOTE OUR PRODUCTS TO OUR CUSTOMERS.

OPERATING CONDITIONS

HAVE BECOME MORE CHALLENGING UNDER THE MOUNTING GLOBAL PRESSURES OF COMPETITION,

INDUSTRY REGULATION AND COST CONTAINMENT. WE ARE TAKING IMPORTANT MEASURES TO

ADDRESS THIS  BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT, INCLUDING THE REDUCTION OF OUR U.S. SALES

FORCE BY 20%, COMPLETED IN DECEMBER 2006, THE ONGOING REDUCTION OF OUR EUROPEAN

SALES FORCE BY MORE THAN 20% (SUBJECT TO CONSULTATION WITH WORKS COUNCILS AND

LOCAL LABOR LAWS), AND THE  RESTRUCTURING OF OUR U.S. PHARMACEUTICAL OPERATIONS

INTO FOUR BUSINESS UNITS TO CREATE A MORE FOCUSED AND ENTREPRENEURIAL

8

ENVIRONMENT, WITH A FIFTH BUSINESS UNIT TO BE RESPONSIBLE FOR CUSTOMER SUPPORT AND SPECIFICALLY FOCUSED ON MANAGED CARE AND ACCESS. WE CONTINUE TO EVALUATE, ADAPT, AND IMPROVE OUR BUSINESS PRACTICES TO BETTER MEET CUSTOMER

AND PUBLIC NEEDS. FOR INSTANCE, WE HAVE TAKEN AN INDUSTRY-LEADING ROLE IN EVOLVING OUR APPROACHES TO DIRECT-TO-CONSUMER ADVERTISING AND MEDICAL EDUCATION GRANTS. WE ALSO CONTINUE TO SPONSOR PROGRAMS TO ADDRESS PATIENT AFFORDABILITY AND ACCESS

BARRIERS, AS WE STRIVE TO ADVANCE FUNDAMENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM CHANGE THROUGH CAMPAIGNS FOR BETTER HEALTHCARE SOLUTIONS.

WHILE OUR ANIMAL HEALTH BUSINESS IS ONE OF THE LARGEST IN THE WORLD, MANY OTHER COMPANIES OFFER COMPETITIVE PRODUCTS. ALTOGETHER, THERE ARE HUNDREDS OF PRODUCERS OF ANIMAL HEALTH PRODUCTS

THROUGHOUT THE WORLD. THE PRINCIPAL METHODS OF COMPETITION VARY SOMEWHAT DEPENDING ON THE PARTICULAR PRODUCT. THEY INCLUDE PRODUCT INNOVATION, QUALITY, PRICE, SERVICE AND EFFECTIVE PROMOTION TO VETERINARY PROFESSIONALS AND CONSUMERS.

MANAGED CARE ORGANIZATIONS

THE GROWTH OF MCOS IN

THE U.S. HAS BEEN A MAJOR FACTOR IN THE COMPETITIVE MAKEUP OF THE HEALTHCARE

MARKETPLACE. APPROXIMATELY 180 MILLION PEOPLE IN THE U.S. NOW PARTICIPATE IN

SOME VERSION OF  MANAGED CARE. BECAUSE OF THE SIZE OF THE PATIENT POPULATION

COVERED BY MCOS, MARKETING OF PRESCRIPTION DRUGS TO THEM AND THE PBMS THAT SERVE

MANY OF THOSE ORGANIZATIONS CONTINUES TO GROW IN IMPORTANCE.

MCOS CAN INCLUDE MEDICAL INSURANCE COMPANIES, MEDICAL PLAN ADMINISTRATORS, HEALTH-MAINTENANCE ORGANIZATIONS, ALLIANCES OF HOSPITALS AND PHYSICIANS AND OTHER PHYSICIAN ORGANIZATIONS. THE

PURCHASING POWER OF MCOS HAS BEEN INCREASING IN RECENT YEARS DUE TO THEIR GROWING NUMBERS OF ENROLLED PATIENTS. AT THE SAME TIME, THOSE ORGANIZATIONS HAVE BEEN CONSOLIDATING INTO FEWER, EVEN LARGER ENTITIES. THIS ENHANCES THEIR PURCHASING STRENGTH

AND IMPORTANCE TO US.

THE GROWTH OF MCOS HAS INCREASED PRESSURE ON DRUG PRICES. ONE OBJECTIVE OF MCOS IS TO CONTAIN AND, WHERE POSSIBLE, REDUCE HEALTHCARE EXPENDITURES. THEY TYPICALLY USE FORMULARIES, VOLUME

PURCHASES AND LONG-TERM CONTRACTS TO NEGOTIATE DISCOUNTS FROM PHARMACEUTICAL PROVIDERS. THEY USE THEIR PURCHASING POWER TO BARGAIN FOR LOWER SUPPLIER PRICES. THEY ALSO EMPHASIZE PRIMARY AND PREVENTIVE CARE, OUT-PATIENT TREATMENT AND PROCEDURES PERFORMED AT DOCTORS OFFICES AND CLINICS.

HOSPITALIZATION AND SURGERY, TYPICALLY THE MOST EXPENSIVE FORMS OF TREATMENT, ARE CAREFULLY MANAGED. SINCE THE USE OF CERTAIN DRUGS CAN PREVENT THE NEED FOR HOSPITALIZATION, PROFESSIONAL THERAPY OR EVEN SURGERY, SUCH DRUGS CAN BECOME FAVORED

FIRST-LINE TREATMENTS FOR CERTAIN DISEASES.

AS DISCUSSED ABOVE IN

MARKETING,

MCOS AND PBMS TYPICALLY DEVELOP FORMULARIES. FORMULARIES CAN BE BASED ON THE PRICES AND

THERAPEUTIC BENEFITS OF THE AVAILABLE PRODUCTS. DUE TO THEIR GENERALLY LOWER COST, GENERIC MEDICINES ARE OFTEN FAVORED. THE BREADTH OF THE PRODUCTS COVERED BY FORMULARIES CAN VARY CONSIDERABLY FROM ONE MCO TO ANOTHER AND MANY FORMULARIES INCLUDE

ALTERNATIVE AND COMPETITIVE PRODUCTS FOR TREATMENT OF PARTICULAR MEDICAL PROBLEMS. MCOS USE A VARIETY OF MEANS TO ENCOURAGE PATIENTS USE OF PRODUCTS LISTED ON THEIR FORMULARIES.

EXCLUSION OF A PRODUCT FROM A FORMULARY OR OTHER RESTRICTIONS, SUCH AS REQUIRING PRIOR AUTHORIZATIONS, CAN LEAD TO ITS SHARPLY REDUCED USAGE IN THE MCO PATIENT POPULATION. CONSEQUENTLY,

PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES COMPETE AGGRESSIVELY TO HAVE THEIR PRODUCTS INCLUDED. WHERE POSSIBLE, COMPANIES COMPETE FOR INCLUSION BASED UPON UNIQUE FEATURES OF THEIR PRODUCTS, SUCH AS GREATER EFFICACY, BETTER PATIENT EASE OF USE OR FEWER SIDE EFFECTS.

A LOWER OVERALL COST OF THERAPY IS ALSO AN IMPORTANT FACTOR. PRODUCTS THAT DEMONSTRATE FEWER THERAPEUTIC ADVANTAGES MUST COMPETE FOR INCLUSION BASED PRIMARILY ON PRICE. WE HAVE BEEN GENERALLY, ALTHOUGH NOT UNIVERSALLY, SUCCESSFUL IN HAVING OUR MAJOR

PRODUCTS INCLUDED ON MOST MCO FORMULARIES.

THE IMPACT OF MCOS ON DRUG PRICES AND VOLUMES MAY INCREASE AS THE RESULT OF THEIR ROLE IN NEGOTIATING ON BEHALF OF MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES IN CONNECTION WITH THE NEW MEDICARE OUT-PATIENT

PRESCRIPTION DRUG BENEFIT, MEDICARE PART D, THAT TOOK EFFECT JANUARY 1, 2006. MCOS AND PBMS NEGOTIATE ON BEHALF OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AS PRESCRIPTION DRUG PLANS (PDPS). WE HAVE BEEN GENERALLY, ALTHOUGH NOT UNIVERSALLY, SUCCESSFUL IN HAVING OUR

MAJOR PRODUCTS THAT ARE USED BY THE SENIOR POPULATION INCLUDED ON THE FORMULARIES OF THE NEW MEDICARE PDPS FOR BOTH 2006 AND 2007.

9

ANOTHER WAY WE DEMONSTRATE

THE VALUE OF PHARMACEUTICALS IN THE CONTEXT OF AN APPROPRIATE APPROACH TO THE

MANAGEMENT OF HEALTHCARE IS BY DEVELOPING DISEASE MANAGEMENT PROGRAMS. THESE

PROGRAMS  CAN IMPROVE PATIENT CARE BY IMPROVING PATIENT COMMUNICATIONS AND COMPLIANCE

WITH DOSAGE DIRECTIONS. THEY CAN ALSO HELP SHOW THAT A COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH

TO HEALTHCARE MANAGEMENT, WHICH INCLUDES PREVENTION, DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENT

OF CERTAIN  CONDITIONS, AND APPROPRIATE USE OF PHARMACEUTICALS, CAN IMPROVE THE

QUALITY OF CARE AND LOWER COSTLY COMPLICATIONS OF CHRONIC DISEASES. AS NOTED

ABOVE IN

MARKETING,

WE

DEVELOPED A NEW COMPANY, GREEN RIBBON HEALTH, WITH THE MCO HUMANA, TO PROVIDE

MEDICARE HEALTH SUPPORT SERVICES UNDER A CONTRACT WITH CMS. THE SERVICES ARE

DESIGNED TO IMPROVE THE HEALTH AND QUALITY OF LIFE FOR BENEFICIARIES WITH MULTIPLE

CHRONIC  CONDITIONS IN CENTRAL FLORIDA. ADDITIONALLY, BEGINNING IN 2001, WE CONTRACTED

WITH THE STATE OF FLORIDA AGENCY FOR HEALTH CARE ADMINISTRATION TO HELP MANAGE

CHRONIC DISEASES AMONG FLORIDAS MEDICAID POPULATION. THAT PROGRAM WAS EXPANDED

IN 2006  UNDER A NEW CONTRACT PFIZER WAS AWARDED BY FLORIDA MEDICAID TO PROVIDE

COMPREHENSIVE DISEASE MANAGEMENT PROGRAMS FOR A LARGER SCOPE OF CHRONICALLY ILL

BENEFICIARIES THROUGH 2009.

GENERIC PRODUCTS

ONE OF THE BIGGEST COMPETITIVE CHALLENGES THAT WE FACE IS FROM GENERIC PHARMACEUTICAL MANUFACTURERS. UPON THE EXPIRATION OR LOSS OF PATENT PROTECTION FOR A PRODUCT, WE CAN LOSE THE MAJOR

PORTION OF SALES OF THAT PRODUCT IN A VERY SHORT PERIOD. SEVERAL SUCH COMPETITORS MAKE A REGULAR PRACTICE OF CHALLENGING OUR PRODUCT PATENTS BEFORE THEIR EXPIRY. GENERIC COMPETITORS OPERATE WITHOUT OUR LARGE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES AND OUR

COSTS OF CONVEYING MEDICAL INFORMATION ABOUT OUR PRODUCTS TO THE MEDICAL COMMUNITY. IN ADDITION, THE FDA APPROVAL PROCESS EXEMPTS GENERICS FROM COSTLY AND TIME-CONSUMING CLINICAL TRIALS TO DEMONSTRATE THEIR SAFETY AND EFFICACY, ALLOWING GENERIC

MANUFACTURERS TO RELY ON THE SAFETY AND EFFICACY DATA OF THE INNOVATOR PRODUCT. GENERIC PRODUCTS NEED ONLY DEMONSTRATE A LEVEL OF AVAILABILITY IN THE BLOODSTREAM EQUIVALENT TO THAT OF THE INNOVATOR PRODUCT. THIS MEANS THAT GENERIC COMPETITORS CAN

MARKET A COMPETING VERSION OF OUR PRODUCT AFTER THE EXPIRATION OR LOSS OF OUR PATENT AND CHARGE MUCH LESS.

IN ADDITION, OUR PATENT-PROTECTED PRODUCTS CAN FACE COMPETITION IN THE FORM OF GENERIC VERSIONS OF BRANDED PRODUCTS OF COMPETITORS THAT LOSE THEIR MARKET EXCLUSIVITY. FOR EXAMPLE,

LIPITOR

BEGAN TO FACE COMPETITION FROM GENERIC PRAVASTATIN (PRAVACHOL) AND GENERIC SIMVASTATIN (ZOCOR) DURING 2006.

AS NOTED ABOVE, MCOS THAT FOCUS PRIMARILY ON THE IMMEDIATE COST OF DRUGS OFTEN FAVOR GENERICS OVER BRAND-NAME DRUGS. MANY GOVERNMENTS ALSO ENCOURAGE THE USE OF GENERICS AS ALTERNATIVES TO

BRAND-NAME DRUGS IN THEIR HEALTHCARE PROGRAMS, INCLUDING MEDICAID IN THE U.S. LAWS IN THE U.S. GENERALLY ALLOW, AND IN SOME CASES REQUIRE, PHARMACISTS TO SUBSTITUTE GENERIC DRUGS THAT HAVE BEEN RATED UNDER GOVERNMENT PROCEDURES TO BE THERAPEUTICALLY

EQUIVALENT TO BRAND-NAME DRUGS. THE SUBSTITUTION MUST BE MADE UNLESS THE PRESCRIBING PHYSICIAN EXPRESSLY FORBIDS IT. IN THE U.S., PFIZERS GREENSTONE SUBSIDIARY SELLS GENERIC VERSIONS OF PFIZERS PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS UPON LOSS OF

EXCLUSIVITY, AS APPROPRIATE.

RAW MATERIALS

RAW MATERIALS ESSENTIAL TO OUR BUSINESSES ARE PURCHASED WORLDWIDE IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS FROM NUMEROUS SUPPLIERS. IN GENERAL, THESE MATERIALS ARE AVAILABLE FROM MULTIPLE SOURCES. NO

SERIOUS SHORTAGES OR DELAYS WERE ENCOUNTERED IN 2006, AND NONE ARE EXPECTED IN 2007.

GOVERNMENT REGULATION AND PRICE CONSTRAINTS

IN THE UNITED STATES

GENERAL.

PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES ARE SUBJECT TO EXTENSIVE REGULATION BY NATIONAL, STATE AND LOCAL AGENCIES IN THE COUNTRIES IN WHICH THEY DO BUSINESS.

OF PARTICULAR IMPORTANCE IS THE FDA IN THE U.S. IT HAS JURISDICTION OVER OUR HUMAN PHARMACEUTICAL BUSINESS AND ADMINISTERS REQUIREMENTS COVERING THE TESTING, SAFETY, EFFECTIVENESS, MANUFACTURING, LABELING, MARKETING, ADVERTISING AND POST-MARKETING

SURVEILLANCE OF OUR PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS. THE FDA ALSO REGULATES OUR ANIMAL HEALTH PRODUCTS, ALONG WITH THE U.S.

10

DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE AND THE U.S. ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY.

IN ADDITION, MANY OF OUR ACTIVITIES ARE SUBJECT TO THE JURISDICTION OF VARIOUS OTHER FEDERAL REGULATORY AND ENFORCEMENT DEPARTMENTS AND AGENCIES, SUCH AS THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN

SERVICES, THE FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION AND THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE. INDIVIDUAL STATES, ACTING THROUGH THEIR ATTORNEYS GENERAL, HAVE BECOME ACTIVE AS WELL, SEEKING TO REGULATE THE MARKETING OF PRESCRIPTION DRUGS UNDER STATE CONSUMER PROTECTION AND

FALSE ADVERTISING LAWS.

WE ARE SUBJECT TO POSSIBLE ADMINISTRATIVE AND LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND ACTIONS BY THESE VARIOUS REGULATORY BODIES (SEE NOTE 19 TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS,

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND CONTINGENCIES,

IN OUR 2006 FINANCIAL REPORT). SUCH ACTIONS MAY INCLUDE PRODUCT RECALLS, SEIZURES AND OTHER CIVIL AND CRIMINAL SANCTIONS.

THE U.S. CONGRESS AND THE FDA ARE CONSIDERING PROPOSALS TO CHANGE HOW THE FDA ASSESSES FOLLOW-ON BIOLOGICAL PRODUCTS. CHANGES THAT WOULD FACILITATE THE APPROVAL OF SUCH PRODUCTS

COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON THE COMPANYS BUSINESS.

MEDICARE.

IN DECEMBER 2003, THE MEDICARE PRESCRIPTION DRUG IMPROVEMENT AND MODERNIZATION ACT OF 2003 (THE 2003 MEDICARE ACT) WAS ENACTED. MEDICARE

BENEFICIARIES ARE NOW ELIGIBLE TO OBTAIN SUBSIDIZED PRESCRIPTION DRUG COVERAGE FROM A CHOICE OF PRIVATE SECTOR PLANS. IT REMAINS DIFFICULT TO PREDICT THE LONG-TERM IMPACT OF THE 2003 MEDICARE ACT ON PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES. USAGE OF PHARMACEUTICALS

IS LIKELY TO INCREASE AS THE RESULT OF THE EXPANDED ACCESS TO MEDICINES AFFORDED BY COVERAGE UNDER MEDICARE. HOWEVER, SUCH EXPANDED UTILIZATION MAY BE OFFSET BY THE INCREASED PRICING PRESSURE AND COMPETITION DUE TO THE ENHANCED PURCHASING POWER OF

THE PRIVATE SECTOR PLANS THAT NEGOTIATE ON BEHALF OF MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES. IN ADDITION, EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2007, MEDICARE ENDED REIMBURSEMENT FOR ED MEDICINES, INCLUDING

VIAGRA.

PFIZER IS COMMITTED TO HELPING ENSURE THAT ALL AMERICANS WITHOUT COVERAGE FOR PRESCRIPTION MEDICINES HAVE ACCESS TO PFIZER PRODUCTS. TO THAT END, IN 2004, WE IMPLEMENTED OUR HELPFUL ANSWERS

PROGRAM, AN UMBRELLA PROGRAM THAT BRINGS TOGETHER PFIZERS LONG-STANDING PATIENT ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS WITH PFIZER PFRIENDS, A NEW PRESCRIPTION DISCOUNT CARD OFFERING SAVINGS ON PFIZER PRESCRIPTION MEDICINES FOR ALL AMERICANS WITHOUT PRESCRIPTION DRUG COVERAGE, REGARDLESS OF AGE OR INCOME. IN ADDITION, IN JANUARY 2005, WE JOINED TOGETHER RX ACCESS WITH

NINE OTHER PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES TO OFFER SAVINGS ON OVER 275 MEDICINES TO MEDICARE-INELIGIBLE, UNINSURED INDIVIDUALS UNDER 65 WHO FALL BELOW CERTAIN INCOME THRESHOLDS. PFIZER ALSO PARTICIPATES IN THE PARTNERSHIP FOR PRESCRIPTION ASSISTANCE, A

SINGLE POINT OF ACCESS TO MORE THAN 475 PUBLIC AND PRIVATE PATIENT ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS.

IMPORTATION OF DRUGS.

THERE

CONTINUE TO BE LEGISLATIVE PROPOSALS TO AMEND U.S. LAW TO ALLOW THE IMPORTATION

INTO THE U.S. OF PRESCRIPTION DRUGS FROM  OUTSIDE THE U.S., WHICH CAN BE SOLD

AT PRICES THAT ARE REGULATED BY THE GOVERNMENTS OF VARIOUS FOREIGN COUNTRIES.

IN ADDITION TO WELL DOCUMENTED SAFETY CONCERNS, SUCH IMPORTATION COULD IMPACT

PHARMACEUTICAL PRICES IN THE U.S. WHILE THE 2003 MEDICARE  ACT MAINTAINS THE

CURRENT PROHIBITION ON SUCH IMPORTS, IT WOULD ALLOW IMPORTATION FROM CANADA IF

THE SECRETARY OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES CERTIFIES THAT SUCH IMPORTATION IS

SAFE AND WOULD RESULT IN SAVINGS TO CONSUMERS. BEFORE THE 2003 MEDICARE  ACT,

FEDERAL LAW WOULD HAVE PERMITTED IMPORTATION OF MEDICINES INTO THE U.S. FROM

A CONSIDERABLY LARGER GROUP OF DEVELOPED COUNTRIES, PROVIDED THE SECRETARY OF

HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES MADE THE SAME SAFETY AND COST-SAVINGS CERTIFICATIONS.

IN  DECEMBER 2004, THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES (HHS) AND THE

DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE ISSUED REPORTS ON DRUG IMPORTATION AND FOREIGN PRICE CONTROLS.

THE HHS REPORT NOTED THAT IT WOULD BE EXTRAORDINARILY DIFFICULT TO ENSURE

THAT DRUGS  PERSONALLY IMPORTED BY INDIVIDUAL CONSUMERS COULD MEET THE

STANDARDS OF SAFETY THAT WOULD SUPPORT CERTIFYING SUCH IMPORTATION AS SAFE. WHILE

THE REPORT ALSO CONCLUDED THAT THE U.S. COULD ESTABLISH A FEASIBLE BASIS FOR

COMMERCIAL DRUG  IMPORTATION, SUCH A CHANGE IN THE LAW WOULD REQUIRE NEW

LEGAL AUTHORITIES, SUBSTANTIAL ADDITIONAL RESOURCES AND SIGNIFICANT RESTRICTIONS

ON THE TYPES OF DRUGS THAT COULD BE IMPORTED. THE REPORT ALSO NOTED THAT

THE TOTAL SAVINGS TO BE  EXPECTED FROM SUCH A COMMERCIAL IMPORTATION REGIME WOULD

BE RELATIVELY SMALL  1% OR 2% OF TOTAL DRUG SPENDING IN THE U.S. THE COMMERCE

DEPARTMENT REPORT CONFIRMED THAT THE LOWER PRICES IN MANY COUNTRIES RESULT FROM

GOVERNMENTAL  PRICE

11

CONTROLS, AND THESE PRICE CONTROLS ADVERSELY AFFECT THE AMOUNT OF FUNDING THAT IS AVAILABLE FOR THE DISCOVERY OF NEW DRUGS.

MEDICAID AND RELATED MATTERS.

FEDERAL LAW REQUIRES US TO GIVE REBATES TO STATE MEDICAID AGENCIES BASED ON EACH STATES REIMBURSEMENT OF

PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS UNDER THE MEDICAID PROGRAM. IN RECENT YEARS, VARIOUS PROPOSALS HAVE BEEN OFFERED AT THE FEDERAL AND STATE LEVELS THAT WOULD BRING ABOUT MAJOR CHANGES IN THE MEDICAID PROGRAM. A NATIONAL COMMISSION RECENTLY RELEASED A LIST OF

RECOMMENDED REFORMS IN THE MEDICAID PROGRAM, ALTHOUGH THE FATE OF THOSE REFORMS IS VERY UNCERTAIN IN THE CURRENT CONGRESS. IN THE SHORT TERM, DRIVEN BY BUDGET CONCERNS, MANY STATES HAVE IMPLEMENTED RESTRICTIVE DRUG LISTS AND STATE SUPPLEMENTAL

REBATE PROGRAMS UNDER THE MEDICAID PROGRAM. THESE PROGRAMS REQUIRE DEEPER REBATE PAYMENTS BY PFIZER IN ORDER TO HAVE OUR PRODUCTS LISTED ON FORMULARIES IN STATES WITH SUCH REBATE PROGRAMS. MORE THAN 40 STATES HAVE IMPLEMENTED SOME FORM OF FORMULARY

RESTRICTIONS IN THEIR MEDICAID PROGRAMS. CURRENTLY, PFIZER ENJOYS RELATIVELY BROAD FORMULARY ACCESS IN STATE MEDICAID PROGRAMS.

SINCE JANUARY 1, 2006, FEDERAL FUNDS HAVE NOT BEEN USED FOR REIMBURSEMENT OF ERECTILE DYSFUNCTION MEDICATIONS, INCLUDING

VIAGRA,

IN THE MEDICAID PROGRAM. IN ADDITION, EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2007, CHANGES TO TREATMENT OF AUTHORIZED GENERICS FOR PURPOSES OF CALCULATING MEDICAID REBATES WILL INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF REBATES WE ARE REQUIRED TO PAY ON BRAND NAME DRUG

SALES AFTER LOSS OF EXCLUSIVITY AND ON AUTHORIZED GENERIC SALES TO THE MEDICAID PROGRAM. CHANGES IMPLEMENTED UNDER THE MEDICAID PROGRAM PRIOR TO 2006, THAT FURTHER RESTRICT THE ACCESS OF A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF PATIENTS TO OUR PRODUCTS, AND REQUIRE

SIGNIFICANTLY DEEPER REBATE PAYMENTS, ARE BEING MITIGATED BY THE SHRINKING SIZE OF THE MEDICAID DRUG PROGRAM. THOSE PEOPLE WHO ARE ELIGIBLE FOR BOTH MEDICAID AND MEDICARE (OFTEN CALLED DUAL ELIGIBLES) HAD BEEN RECEIVING THEIR DRUG

BENEFITS UNDER THE MEDICAID PROGRAM. BEGINNING IN 2006, THEIR COVERAGE WAS TRANSFERRED TO THE NEW MEDICARE PART D PROGRAM. THIS REDUCED THE NUMBER OF ENROLLEES IN MEDICAID DRUG PROGRAMS, THE SIZE OF THE MEDICAID DRUG PROGRAM, AND ITS IMPACT ON OUR

BUSINESS. WHILE THE MEDICAID MARKET IS NOW SMALLER, CHANGES AT THE STATE LEVEL COULD IMPACT LARGER FEDERAL AND COMMERCIAL ACCOUNTS.

IN ADDITION, SOME STATES ARE CONSIDERING PRICE-CONTROL REGIMES THAT WOULD APPLY TO BROADER SEGMENTS OF THEIR POPULATIONS THAT ARE NOT MEDICAID ELIGIBLE, AS WELL AS VARIOUS APPROACHES TO

CONTROLLING PHARMACEUTICAL MARKETING ACTIVITIES. A STATE-ADMINISTERED PHARMACY DISCOUNT PROGRAM WAS ENACTED BY THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA DURING 2006 THAT HAS POTENTIAL IMPACT ON ACCESS AND REIMBURSEMENT FOR OUR PRODUCTS IN THE MED-CAL PROGRAM. THE FATE OF THIS NEW DISCOUNT

CARD PROGRAM IS UNCERTAIN GIVEN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENTS PREVIOUS CONCERNS ABOUT PROGRAMS WITH SIMILAR STRUCTURES. MOREOVER, FULL IMPLEMENTATION OF THE CALIFORNIA PROGRAM, EVEN IF IT WERE APPROVED BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT, IS SEVERAL YEARS

AWAY. HOWEVER, IF MANY STATES WERE TO REQUIRE STEEP REBATE PAYMENTS IN DISCOUNT PROGRAMS FOR THE UNINSURED AND TO LINK MEDICAID BENEFICIARIES ACCESS TO OUR PRODUCTS TO SUCH DISCOUNT PROGRAMS, THE IMPACT ON PATIENTS ACCESS TO MEDICINES

AND ON PFIZER COULD BE SIGNIFICANT.

WE ALSO MUST GIVE DISCOUNTS OR REBATES ON PURCHASES OR REIMBURSEMENTS OF PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS BY CERTAIN OTHER FEDERAL AND STATE AGENCIES AND PROGRAMS. SEE THE DISCUSSION REGARDING REBATES

IN THE

REVENUES

SECTION OF OUR 2006 FINANCIAL REPORT AND IN NOTE 1-G TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS,

SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES, REVENUES,

IN OUR 2006 FINANCIAL

REPORT, WHICH DISCUSSIONS ARE INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE.

OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES

WE ENCOUNTER SIMILAR REGULATORY AND LEGISLATIVE ISSUES IN MOST OTHER COUNTRIES. IN EUROPE AND SOME OTHER INTERNATIONAL MARKETS, THE GOVERNMENT PROVIDES HEALTHCARE AT LOW DIRECT COST TO

CONSUMERS AND REGULATES PHARMACEUTICAL PRICES OR PATIENT REIMBURSEMENT LEVELS TO CONTROL COSTS FOR THE GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED HEALTHCARE SYSTEM. THIS INTERNATIONAL PATCHWORK OF PRICE REGULATION HAS LED TO DIFFERENT PRICES AND SOME THIRD-PARTY TRADE IN

OUR PRODUCTS FROM MARKETS WITH LOWER PRICES. SUCH TRADE EXPLOITING PRICE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN COUNTRIES CAN UNDERMINE OUR SALES IN MARKETS WITH HIGHER PRICES.

THE APPROVAL OF NEW DRUGS ACROSS THE EU MAY ONLY BE ACHIEVED USING THE MUTUAL RECOGNITION PROCEDURE/DECENTRALIZED PROCEDURE OR EU COMMISSION/EMEAS CENTRAL APPROVAL PROCESS, WHICH APPLIES

IN THE (NOW) 27 EU MEMBER STATES

12

(SINCE BULGARIA AND ROMANIA JOINED ON JANUARY 1, 2007), PLUS NORWAY AND ICELAND, WHICH ARE FULL PARTICIPANTS IN THESE REGISTRATION PROCESSES. THE USE OF THESE PROCEDURES PROVIDES A MORE RAPID AND CONSISTENT APPROVAL ACROSS

THE MEMBER STATES THAN WAS THE CASE WHEN THE APPROVAL PROCESSES WERE OPERATING INDEPENDENTLY WITHIN EACH COUNTRY.

SINCE THE EU DOES NOT HAVE JURISDICTION OVER PATIENT REIMBURSEMENT OR PRICING MATTERS IN ITS MEMBER STATES, WE CONTINUE TO DEAL WITH INDIVIDUAL COUNTRIES ON SUCH MATTERS ACROSS THE

REGION.

DURING 2004, A COMPREHENSIVE PACKAGE OF REFORMS WAS ADOPTED (CALLED NEW MEDICINES LEGISLATION) AMENDING EU LAW ON THE REGULATION OF MEDICINAL PRODUCTS IN MANY AREAS, INCLUDING APPROVAL

PROCEDURES AND SAFETY REPORTING. OF PARTICULAR NOTE, THE DATA EXCLUSIVITY PERIODS DURING WHICH INNOVATIVE COMPANIES REGULATORY DATA ARE PROTECTED ARE REQUIRED TO BE HARMONIZED IN ALL MEMBER STATES AND IMPLEMENTATION IS COMPLETE OR UNDERWAY IN

MOST MEMBER STATES, WHICH WILL FACILITATE THE APPROVAL AND LAUNCH OF GENERIC MEDICINES. IN ADDITION, THESE REFORMS INTRODUCED A CLEAR LEGAL BASIS FOR THE APPROVAL OF BIOSIMILAR OR FOLLOW-ON BIOLOGICAL PRODUCTS IN THE EU.

FOLLOWING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THESE NEW REGULATIONS (IN NOVEMBER 2005), THE FIRST SUCH PRODUCTS, INCLUDING A BIOSIMILAR VERSION OF

GENOTROPIN,

WERE APPROVED IN THE EU IN 2006.

THE NEW REGULATIONS ALSO SHORTENED CERTAIN APPROVAL TIMELINES AND INTRODUCED FAST-TRACK AND CONDITIONAL CENTRALIZED AUTHORIZATIONS. PFIZERS

SUTENT

WAS THE FIRST PRODUCT

TO BE CONDITIONALLY APPROVED UNDER THE NEW LAW IN 2006 (ALTHOUGH ITS STATUS HAS NOW CONVERTED TO FULL AUTHORIZATION).

MORE RECENTLY, ON JANUARY 26, 2007, THE NEW EU REGULATION ON MEDICINES FOR PEDIATRIC USE BECAME EFFECTIVE. THIS INTRODUCES NEW OBLIGATIONS ON PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES TO CONDUCT RESEARCH ON

THEIR MEDICINES IN CHILDREN AND, SUBJECT TO VARIOUS CONDITIONS, OFFERS THE POSSIBILITY OF INCENTIVES FOR SO DOING, INCLUDING EXCLUSIVITY EXTENSIONS.

ENVIRONMENTAL LAW COMPLIANCE

MOST OF OUR OPERATIONS ARE AFFECTED BY FEDERAL, STATE AND/OR LOCAL ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS. WE HAVE MADE, AND INTEND TO CONTINUE TO MAKE, NECESSARY EXPENDITURES FOR COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE LAWS.

WE ALSO ARE CLEANING UP ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINATION FROM PAST INDUSTRIAL ACTIVITY AT CERTAIN SITES (SEE NOTE 19 TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS,

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND CONTINGENCIES,

IN OUR 2006 FINANCIAL REPORT). AS A RESULT, WE INCURRED CAPITAL AND OPERATIONAL EXPENDITURES IN 2006 FOR ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLIANCE PURPOSES AND FOR THE CLEAN-UP OF CERTAIN PAST INDUSTRIAL ACTIVITY AS FOLLOWS.

ENVIRONMENT-RELATED CAPITAL EXPENDITURES 

$47 MILLION

OTHER ENVIRONMENT-RELATED EXPENSES 

$206 MILLION

WHILE WE CANNOT PREDICT WITH CERTAINTY FUTURE CAPITAL EXPENDITURES OR OPERATING COSTS FOR ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLIANCE, WE DO NOT BELIEVE THEY WILL HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON OUR CAPITAL EXPENDITURES OR COMPETITIVE POSITION.

TAX MATTERS

THE DISCUSSION OF TAX-RELATED MATTERS IN NOTE 7 TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS,

TAXES ON INCOME,

IN OUR 2006

FINANCIAL REPORT, IS INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE.

EMPLOYEES

IN OUR INNOVATION-INTENSIVE BUSINESS, OUR EMPLOYEES ARE VITAL TO OUR SUCCESS. WE BELIEVE WE HAVE GOOD RELATIONSHIPS WITH OUR EMPLOYEES. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2006, WE EMPLOYED APPROXIMATELY 98,000

PEOPLE IN OUR OPERATIONS THROUGHOUT THE WORLD. ON JANUARY 22, 2007, THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED, AS A PART OF ITS PRIORITIES TO DRIVE IMPROVED PERFORMANCE, POSITION THE COMPANY FOR FUTURE SUCCESS AND ENHANCE TOTAL SHAREHOLDER RETURN, A PLAN TO ELIMINATE

ABOUT 10,000 POSITIONS, OR ABOUT 10% OF PFIZERS WORLDWIDE WORKFORCE, BY THE END OF 2008.

13

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS AND CAUTIONARY FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT FUTURE RESULTS

THE STATEMENTS IN THIS SECTION DESCRIBE THE MAJOR RISKS TO OUR BUSINESS AND SHOULD BE CONSIDERED CAREFULLY. IN ADDITION, THESE STATEMENTS CONSTITUTE OUR CAUTIONARY STATEMENTS UNDER THE PRIVATE

SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995.

OUR DISCLOSURE AND

ANALYSIS IN THIS 2006 FORM 10-K AND IN OUR 2006 ANNUAL REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS

CONTAIN SOME FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS THAT SET FORTH ANTICIPATED RESULTS BASED

ON  MANAGEMENTS PLANS AND ASSUMPTIONS. FROM TIME TO TIME, WE ALSO PROVIDE

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS IN OTHER MATERIALS WE RELEASE TO THE PUBLIC AS WELL

AS ORAL FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS. SUCH STATEMENTS GIVE OUR CURRENT EXPECTATIONS

OR FORECASTS  OF FUTURE EVENTS; THEY DO NOT RELATE STRICTLY TO HISTORICAL OR

CURRENT FACTS. WE HAVE TRIED, WHEREVER POSSIBLE, TO IDENTIFY SUCH STATEMENTS

BY USING WORDS SUCH ASANTICIPATE, ESTIMATE, EXPECT, PROJECT,

INTEND, PLAN, BELIEVE, WILL, TARGET, FORECAST AND

SIMILAR EXPRESSIONS IN CONNECTION WITH ANY DISCUSSION OF FUTURE OPERATING OR

FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE OR BUSINESS PLANS OR  PROSPECTS. IN PARTICULAR, THESE INCLUDE

STATEMENTS RELATING TO FUTURE ACTIONS, BUSINESS PLANS AND PROSPECTS, PROSPECTIVE

PRODUCTS OR PRODUCT APPROVALS, FUTURE PERFORMANCE OR RESULTS OF CURRENT AND ANTICIPATED

PRODUCTS, SALES EFFORTS, EXPENSES, INTEREST RATES, FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES, THE

OUTCOME OF CONTINGENCIES, SUCH AS LEGAL PROCEEDINGS, AND FINANCIAL RESULTS.

WE CANNOT GUARANTEE THAT ANY FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENT WILL BE REALIZED, ALTHOUGH WE BELIEVE WE HAVE BEEN PRUDENT IN OUR PLANS AND ASSUMPTIONS. ACHIEVEMENT OF FUTURE RESULTS IS SUBJECT TO

RISKS, UNCERTAINTIES AND POTENTIALLY INACCURATE ASSUMPTIONS. SHOULD KNOWN OR UNKNOWN RISKS OR UNCERTAINTIES MATERIALIZE, OR SHOULD UNDERLYING ASSUMPTIONS PROVE INACCURATE, ACTUAL RESULTS COULD DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM PAST RESULTS AND THOSE

ANTICIPATED, ESTIMATED OR PROJECTED. YOU SHOULD BEAR THIS IN MIND AS YOU CONSIDER FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS.

WE UNDERTAKE NO OBLIGATION TO PUBLICLY UPDATE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS, WHETHER AS A RESULT OF NEW INFORMATION, FUTURE EVENTS OR OTHERWISE. YOU ARE ADVISED, HOWEVER, TO CONSULT ANY FURTHER DISCLOSURES WE MAKE ON RELATED SUBJECTS IN OUR  10-Q AND 8-K REPORTS TO THE SEC. ALSO NOTE THAT WE PROVIDE THE FOLLOWING CAUTIONARY DISCUSSION OF RISKS, UNCERTAINTIES AND POSSIBLY INACCURATE ASSUMPTIONS RELEVANT TO OUR BUSINESSES. THESE ARE FACTORS THAT, INDIVIDUALLY

OR IN THE AGGREGATE, WE THINK COULD CAUSE OUR ACTUAL RESULTS TO DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM EXPECTED AND HISTORICAL RESULTS. WE NOTE THESE FACTORS FOR INVESTORS AS PERMITTED BY THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995. YOU SHOULD UNDERSTAND

THAT IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO PREDICT OR IDENTIFY ALL SUCH FACTORS. CONSEQUENTLY, YOU SHOULD NOT CONSIDER THE FOLLOWING TO BE A COMPLETE DISCUSSION OF ALL POTENTIAL RISKS OR UNCERTAINTIES.

GOVERNMENT REGULATION AND MANAGED CARE TRENDS

U.S. AND FOREIGN GOVERNMENTAL REGULATIONS MANDATING PRICE CONTROLS AND LIMITATIONS ON PATIENT ACCESS TO OUR PRODUCTS IMPACT OUR BUSINESS, AND OUR FUTURE RESULTS COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY

CHANGES IN SUCH REGULATIONS. IN THE U.S., MANY OF OUR PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS ARE SUBJECT TO INCREASING PRICING PRESSURES. SUCH PRESSURES MAY INCREASE AS THE RESULT OF THE 2003 MEDICARE ACT DUE TO THE ENHANCED PURCHASING POWER OF THE PRIVATE SECTOR

PLANS THAT NEGOTIATE ON BEHALF OF MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES. IN ADDITION, IF THE 2003 MEDICARE ACT WERE AMENDED TO IMPOSE DIRECT GOVERNMENTAL PRICE CONTROLS AND ACCESS RESTRICTIONS, IT WOULD HAVE A SIGNIFICANT ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR BUSINESS. IN

ADDITION, MCOS, AS WELL AS MEDICAID AND OTHER GOVERNMENT AGENCIES, CONTINUE TO SEEK PRICE DISCOUNTS. SOME STATES HAVE IMPLEMENTED AND OTHER STATES ARE CONSIDERING PRICE CONTROLS OR PATIENT-ACCESS CONSTRAINTS UNDER THE MEDICAID PROGRAM AND SOME

STATES ARE CONSIDERING PRICE-CONTROL REGIMES THAT WOULD APPLY TO BROADER SEGMENTS OF THEIR POPULATIONS THAT ARE NOT MEDICAID ELIGIBLE. OTHER MATTERS ALSO COULD BE THE SUBJECT OF U.S. FEDERAL OR STATE LEGISLATIVE OR REGULATORY ACTION THAT COULD

ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, INCLUDING THE IMPORTATION OF PRESCRIPTION DRUGS THAT ARE MARKETED FROM OUTSIDE THE U.S. AT PRICES THAT ARE REGULATED BY THE GOVERNMENTS OF VARIOUS FOREIGN COUNTRIES.

THE PROHIBITION ON THE USE OF FEDERAL FUNDS FOR REIMBURSEMENT OF ED MEDICATIONS BY THE MEDICAID PROGRAM, WHICH BECAME EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2006, AND THE SIMILAR FEDERAL FUNDING PROHIBITION FOR

THE

14

MEDICARE PROGRAM, WHICH BECAME EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2007, MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS. ANY PROHIBITIONS ON THE USE OF FEDERAL FUNDS FOR REIMBURSEMENT OF OTHER CLASSES OF DRUGS IN THE FUTURE MAY ALSO HAVE AN ADVERSE

EFFECT.

WE ENCOUNTER SIMILAR REGULATORY AND LEGISLATIVE ISSUES IN MOST OTHER COUNTRIES. IN EUROPE AND SOME OTHER INTERNATIONAL MARKETS, THE GOVERNMENT PROVIDES HEALTHCARE AT LOW DIRECT COST TO

CONSUMERS AND REGULATES PHARMACEUTICAL PRICES OR PATIENT REIMBURSEMENT LEVELS TO CONTROL COSTS FOR THE GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED HEALTHCARE SYSTEM. THIS INTERNATIONAL PATCHWORK OF PRICE REGULATION HAS LED TO DIFFERENT PRICES AND SOME THIRD-PARTY TRADE IN

OUR PRODUCTS FROM MARKETS WITH LOWER PRICES. SUCH TRADE EXPLOITING PRICE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN COUNTRIES CAN UNDERMINE OUR SALES IN MARKETS WITH HIGHER PRICES. AS A RESULT, IT IS EXPECTED THAT PRESSURES ON THE PRICING COMPONENT OF OPERATING RESULTS

WILL CONTINUE.

GENERIC COMPETITION

COMPETITION FROM MANUFACTURERS

OF GENERIC DRUGS IS A MAJOR CHALLENGE FOR US AROUND THE WORLD. UPON THE EXPIRATION

OR LOSS OF PATENT PROTECTION FOR ONE OF OUR PRODUCTS, OR UPON THE

AT-RISK LAUNCH (DESPITE PENDING PATENT INFRINGEMENT LITIGATION AGAINST

THE GENERIC PRODUCT) BY A GENERIC MANUFACTURER OF A GENERIC VERSION OF ONE OF

OUR PRODUCTS, WE CAN LOSE THE MAJOR PORTION OF SALES OF THAT PRODUCT IN A VERY

SHORT  PERIOD, WHICH CAN ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS. THE U.S. BASIC PATENT

FOR

ZOLOFT

EXPIRED

IN 2006 AND WILL EXPIRE IN 2007 FOR EACH OF

NORVASC

AND

ZYRTEC.

GENERIC VERSIONS OF

ZOLOFT

WERE

LAUNCHED IN 2006 AND WE EXPECT GENERIC VERSIONS OF

NORVASC

AND

ZYRTEC

TO

BE LAUNCHED IN 2007. THE U.S.  BASIC PATENTS ON

CAMPTOSAR

AND

INSPRA

EXPIRE

IN 2008. ALSO, THE PATENTS COVERING SEVERAL OF OUR MOST  IMPORTANT MEDICINES,

INCLUDING

LIPITOR, NORVASC, CELEBREX, DETROL

AND

CADUET,

ARE

BEING CHALLENGED BY  GENERIC MANUFACTURERS. IN ADDITION, OUR PATENT-PROTECTED

PRODUCTS CAN FACE COMPETITION IN THE FORM OF GENERIC VERSIONS OF BRANDED PRODUCTS

OF COMPETITORS THAT LOSE THEIR MARKET EXCLUSIVITY. FOR EXAMPLE,

LIPITOR

BEGAN

TO FACE COMPETITION FROM GENERIC PRAVASTATIN (PRAVACHOL) AND GENERIC SIMVASTATIN

(ZOCOR) DURING 2006.

IN 2006, THE FDA APPROVED A NEW BRANDED SOMATROPIN PRODUCT THAT WILL COMPETE WITH

GENOTROPIN.

COMPETITIVE PRODUCTS

WE CANNOT PREDICT WITH ACCURACY THE TIMING OR IMPACT OF THE INTRODUCTION OF COMPETITIVE PRODUCTS OR THEIR POSSIBLE EFFECT ON OUR SALES. PRODUCTS THAT COMPETE WITH OUR DRUGS, INCLUDING SOME OF

OUR BEST-SELLING MEDICINES, ARE LAUNCHED FROM TIME TO TIME. LAUNCHES OF A NUMBER OF COMPETITIVE PRODUCTS HAVE OCCURRED RECENTLY, AND CERTAIN POTENTIALLY COMPETITIVE PRODUCTS ARE IN VARIOUS STAGES OF DEVELOPMENT, SOME OF WHICH HAVE BEEN FILED FOR

APPROVAL WITH THE FDA AND WITH REGULATORY AUTHORITIES IN OTHER COUNTRIES.

DEPENDENCE ON KEY IN-LINE AND NEW PRODUCTS

WE RECORDED PRODUCT SALES OF MORE THAN $1 BILLION FOR EACH OF NINE PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS IN 2006.

LIPITOR, NORVASC, ZOLOFT, LYRICA, CELEBREX, VIAGRA,

DETROL/DETROL LA, XALATAN/XALACOM

AND

ZYRTEC.

THOSE PRODUCTS ACCOUNTED FOR 64% OF OUR PHARMACEUTICAL REVENUES IN 2006.

LIPITOR

SALES IN 2006 WERE

APPROXIMATELY $12.9 BILLION, ACCOUNTING FOR 28.6% OF OUR TOTAL 2006 PHARMACEUTICAL REVENUES. IF THESE OR ANY OF OUR OTHER MAJOR PRODUCTS WERE TO BECOME SUBJECT TO PROBLEMS SUCH AS LOSS OF PATENT PROTECTION, CHANGES IN PRESCRIPTION GROWTH RATES,

MATERIAL PRODUCT LIABILITY LITIGATION, UNEXPECTED SIDE EFFECTS, REGULATORY PROCEEDINGS, PUBLICITY AFFECTING DOCTOR OR PATIENT CONFIDENCE OR PRESSURE FROM EXISTING COMPETITIVE PRODUCTS, OR IF A NEW, MORE EFFECTIVE TREATMENT SHOULD BE INTRODUCED, THE

ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR REVENUES COULD BE SIGNIFICANT. AS NOTED, PATENTS COVERING SEVERAL OF OUR BEST-SELLING MEDICINES RECENTLY HAVE EXPIRED OR WILL EXPIRE THIS YEAR OR NEXT YEAR, AND PATENTS COVERING A NUMBER OF OUR BEST-SELLING MEDICINES ARE THE

SUBJECT OF PENDING LEGAL CHALLENGES. IN ADDITION, OUR REVENUES COULD BE SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACTED BY THE TIMING AND RATE OF COMMERCIAL ACCEPTANCE OF KEY NEW PRODUCTS, INCLUDING

LYRICA, EXUBERA, SUTENT, CHANTIX/

CHAMPIX

AND

ERAXIS.

15

UNCERTAINTY RELATING TO COX-2 MEDICINES

OUR ABILITY TO INCREASE

CELEBREX

SALES MAY BE LIMITED BY THE CONTINUING CONCERN ABOUT THE SAFETY OF NON-STEROIDAL

ANTI-INFLAMMATORY PAIN RELIEVERS.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT INVESTMENT

THE DISCOVERY AND DEVELOPMENT OF NEW PRODUCTS AS WELL AS THE DEVELOPMENT OF ADDITIONAL USES FOR EXISTING PRODUCTS IS VERY IMPORTANT TO THE SUCCESS OF THE COMPANY. HOWEVER, BALANCING CURRENT

GROWTH AND INVESTMENT FOR THE FUTURE REMAINS A MAJOR CHALLENGE. OUR ONGOING INVESTMENTS IN NEW PRODUCT INTRODUCTIONS AND IN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT FOR NEW PRODUCTS AND EXISTING PRODUCT EXTENSIONS COULD EXCEED CORRESPONDING SALES GROWTH. THIS COULD

PRODUCE HIGHER COSTS WITHOUT A PROPORTIONAL INCREASE IN REVENUES.

DEVELOPMENT, REGULATORY APPROVAL AND MARKETING OF PRODUCTS

RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES PARTICULARLY APPLY WITH RESPECT TO PRODUCT-RELATED, FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS. THE OUTCOME OF THE LENGTHY AND COMPLEX PROCESS OF IDENTIFYING NEW COMPOUNDS AND

DEVELOPING NEW PRODUCTS IS INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE AS TO WHETHER OR WHEN WE WILL RECEIVE REGULATORY APPROVAL FOR NEW PRODUCTS OR FOR NEW INDICATIONS OR DOSAGE FORMS FOR EXISTING PRODUCTS. DECISIONS BY REGULATORY AUTHORITIES

REGARDING LABELING AND OTHER MATTERS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE AVAILABILITY OR COMMERCIAL POTENTIAL OF OUR PRODUCTS. THERE ALSO ARE MANY CONSIDERATIONS THAT CAN AFFECT MARKETING OF PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS AROUND THE WORLD. REGULATORY DELAYS, THE

INABILITY TO SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETE CLINICAL TRIALS, CLAIMS AND CONCERNS ABOUT SAFETY AND EFFICACY, NEW DISCOVERIES, PATENT DISPUTES AND CLAIMS ABOUT ADVERSE SIDE EFFECTS ARE A FEW OF THE FACTORS THAT COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE REALIZATION OF

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT AND PRODUCT-RELATED, FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS.

RESEARCH STUDIES

DECISIONS ABOUT RESEARCH STUDIES MADE EARLY IN THE DEVELOPMENT PROCESS OF A DRUG CANDIDATE CAN HAVE A SUBSTANTIAL IMPACT ON THE MARKETING STRATEGY ONCE THE DRUG RECEIVES APPROVAL. MORE

DETAILED STUDIES MAY DEMONSTRATE ADDITIONAL BENEFITS THAT CAN HELP IN THE MARKETING, BUT THEY CONSUME TIME AND RESOURCES AND CAN DELAY SUBMITTING THE DRUG CANDIDATE FOR INITIAL APPROVAL. WE TRY TO PLAN CLINICAL TRIALS PRUDENTLY, BUT

THERE IS NO GUARANTEE THAT A PROPER BALANCE OF SPEED AND TESTING WILL BE MADE IN EACH CASE. THE QUALITY OF OUR DECISIONS IN THIS AREA COULD AFFECT OUR FUTURE RESULTS.

INTEREST RATE AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK

46.6% OF OUR TOTAL 2006 REVENUES WERE DERIVED FROM INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS, INCLUDING 29.3% FROM THE EUROPE/CANADA REGION AND 12.3% FROM THE JAPAN/ASIA REGION. THESE INTERNATIONAL-BASED

REVENUES AS WELL AS OUR SUBSTANTIAL INTERNATIONAL ASSETS EXPOSE OUR REVENUES AND EARNINGS TO FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE CHANGES. IN ADDITION, OUR INTEREST-BEARING INVESTMENTS, LOANS AND BORROWINGS ARE SUBJECT TO RISK FROM CHANGES IN INTEREST

RATES. THESE RISKS AND THE MEASURES WE HAVE TAKEN TO HELP CONTAIN THEM ARE DISCUSSED IN THE SECTION ENTITLED FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT IN OUR 2006 FINANCIAL REPORT. FOR ADDITIONAL DETAILS, SEE NOTE 9-D TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS,

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS: DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES  FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK,

IN OUR 2006 FINANCIAL REPORT. THOSE SECTIONS OF OUR 2006 FINANCIAL REPORT

ARE INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE.

NOTWITHSTANDING OUR EFFORTS TO FORESEE AND MITIGATE THE EFFECTS OF CHANGES IN FISCAL CIRCUMSTANCES, WE CANNOT PREDICT WITH CERTAINTY CHANGES IN CURRENCY AND INTEREST RATES, INFLATION OR OTHER

RELATED FACTORS AFFECTING OUR BUSINESSES.

RISKS AFFECTING INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS

OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS ALSO COULD BE AFFECTED BY CHANGES IN INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY LEGAL PROTECTIONS AND REMEDIES, TRADE REGULATIONS AND PROCEDURES AND ACTIONS AFFECTING APPROVAL,

PRODUCTION, PRICING, REIMBURSEMENT AND MARKETING OF PRODUCTS, AS WELL AS BY UNSTABLE GOVERNMENTS AND LEGAL SYSTEMS AND INTER-GOVERNMENTAL DISPUTES. ANY OF THESE CHANGES COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS.

16

PRODUCT MANUFACTURING AND MARKETING RISKS

DIFFICULTIES OR DELAYS IN PRODUCT MANUFACTURING OR MARKETING, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE INABILITY TO INCREASE PRODUCTION CAPACITY COMMENSURATE WITH DEMAND, OR THE FAILURE TO PREDICT

MARKET DEMAND FOR, OR TO GAIN MARKET ACCEPTANCE OF, APPROVED PRODUCTS, COULD AFFECT FUTURE RESULTS.

COST AND EXPENSE CONTROL/UNUSUAL EVENTS

GROWTH IN COSTS AND EXPENSES,

CHANGES IN PRODUCT, SEGMENT AND GEOGRAPHIC MIX AND THE IMPACT OF ACQUISITIONS,

DIVESTITURES, RESTRUCTURINGS, PRODUCT WITHDRAWALS AND OTHER UNUSUAL EVENTS THAT

COULD RESULT FROM EVOLVING BUSINESS STRATEGIES, EVALUATION OF ASSET REALIZATION

AND ORGANIZATIONAL RESTRUCTURING COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT FUTURE RESULTS. SUCH

RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES INCLUDE, IN PARTICULAR, OUR ABILITY TO REALIZE THE PROJECTED

BENEFITS OF OUR ADAPTING TO SCALE MULTI-YEAR PRODUCTIVITY INITIATIVE, INCLUDING

THE PROJECTED BENEFITS OF THE BROADENING OF THIS INITIATIVE OVER THE NEXT FEW

YEARS.

CHANGES IN LAWS AND ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

OUR FUTURE RESULTS COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY CHANGES IN LAWS AND REGULATIONS, INCLUDING CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING STANDARDS, TAXATION REQUIREMENTS (INCLUDING TAX-RATE CHANGES, NEW TAX LAWS AND

REVISED TAX LAW INTERPRETATIONS), COMPETITION LAWS AND ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS IN THE U.S. AND OTHER COUNTRIES.

TERRORIST ACTIVITY

OUR FUTURE RESULTS COULD

BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY CHANGES IN BUSINESS, POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS,

INCLUDING THE COST AND AVAILABILITY OF INSURANCE, DUE TO THE THREAT OF TERRORIST

ACTIVITY IN THE U.S. AND OTHER PARTS OF THE WORLD AND RELATED U.S. MILITARY ACTION

OVERSEAS.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

WE AND CERTAIN OF OUR

SUBSIDIARIES ARE INVOLVED IN VARIOUS PATENT, PRODUCT LIABILITY, CONSUMER, COMMERCIAL,

SECURITIES, ENVIRONMENTAL AND TAX LITIGATIONS AND CLAIMS, GOVERNMENT  INVESTIGATIONS,

AND OTHER LEGAL PROCEEDINGS THAT ARISE FROM TIME TO

TIME IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF OUR BUSINESS. LITIGATION IS INHERENTLY UNPREDICTABLE,

AND EXCESSIVE VERDICTS DO OCCUR. ALTHOUGH WE BELIEVE WE HAVE SUBSTANTIAL DEFENSES

IN  THESE MATTERS, WE COULD IN THE FUTURE INCUR JUDGMENTS OR ENTER INTO SETTLEMENTS

OF CLAIMS THAT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

IN ANY PARTICULAR PERIOD.

PATENT CLAIMS INCLUDE CHALLENGES TO THE COVERAGE AND/OR VALIDITY OF OUR PATENTS ON VARIOUS PRODUCTS OR PROCESSES. ALTHOUGH WE BELIEVE WE HAVE SUBSTANTIAL DEFENSES TO THESE CHALLENGES WITH

RESPECT TO ALL OUR MATERIAL PATENTS, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE AS TO THE OUTCOME OF THESE MATTERS, AND A LOSS IN ANY OF THESE CASES COULD RESULT IN A LOSS OF PATENT PROTECTION FOR THE DRUG AT ISSUE, WHICH COULD LEAD TO A SIGNIFICANT LOSS OF SALES OF

THAT DRUG AND COULD MATERIALLY AFFECT FUTURE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES

WE PLAN TO ENHANCE OUR

PIPELINE THROUGH ACQUISITIONS, LICENSING AND ALLIANCES (SEE

REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT AND PIPELINE PRODUCTIVITY

UNDER

OVERVIEW

OF OUR PERFORMANCE AND OPERATING ENVIRONMENT

IN

OUR 2006 FINANCIAL REPORT, WHICH SECTION IS INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE). HOWEVER,

THESE ENHANCEMENT PLANS ARE SUBJECT TO THE AVAILABILITY OF APPROPRIATE OPPORTUNITIES

AND COMPETITION FROM OTHER PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES THAT ARE SEEKING  SIMILAR

OPPORTUNITIES.

IS DEFINED IN RULES 13A-15(E) AND 15D-15(E) UNDER THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934 (THE EXCHANGE ACT)). BASED ON THIS EVALUATION, OUR PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND PRINCIPAL FINANCIAL OFFICER CONCLUDED THAT OUR DISCLOSURE CONTROLS

AND PROCEDURES ARE EFFECTIVE IN ALERTING THEM IN A TIMELY MANNER TO MATERIAL INFORMATION REQUIRED TO BE DISCLOSED IN OUR PERIODIC REPORTS FILED WITH THE SEC.

INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

MANAGEMENTS REPORT ON THE COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING (AS SUCH TERM IS DEFINED IN RULES 13A-15(F) AND 15D-15(F) UNDER THE EXCHANGE ACT), AND THE RELATED

OUR CONTROLS OVER A MULTI-YEAR PERIOD. WE CONTINUE TO PURSUE A MULTI-YEAR INITIATIVE TO OUTSOURCE SOME TRANSACTION-PROCESSING ACTIVITIES WITHIN CERTAIN ACCOUNTING PROCESSES AND ARE MIGRATING TO A CONSISTENT ENTERPRISE RESOURCE PLANNING SYSTEM ACROSS

THE ORGANIZATION. THESE ARE ENHANCEMENTS OF ONGOING ACTIVITIES TO SUPPORT THE GROWTH OF OUR FINANCIAL SHARED SERVICE CAPABILITIES AND STANDARDIZE OUR FINANCIAL SYSTEMS. NONE OF THESE INITIATIVES IS IN RESPONSE TO ANY IDENTIFIED DEFICIENCY OR

WEAKNESS IN OUR INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING.
