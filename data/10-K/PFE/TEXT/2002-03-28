CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE PRODUCTS THAT TREAT PROBLEMS AFFECTING THE HEART

AND THE BLOOD CIRCULATORY SYSTEM MAKE UP OUR LARGEST THERAPEUTIC PRODUCT LINE.

LIPITOR

, OUR LARGEST-SELLING PRODUCT, IS FOR TREATMENT OF HIGH LIPIDS

(CHOLESTEROL AND TRIGLYCERIDES) IN THE BLOODSTREAM. IT IS ONE OF THE

LARGEST-SELLING PRESCRIPTION DRUGS OF ANY KIND IN THE WORLD.

NORVASC

ONCE-A-DAY MEDICATION FOR HYPERTENSION (HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE) AND ANGINA (HEART

PAIN). IT IS THE LARGEST-SELLING HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE AND HEART PAIN MEDICINE IN

THE WORLD. OUR OTHER CARDIOVASCULAR PRODUCTS INCLUDE

PROCARDIA XL,

CARDURA

AND

ACCUPRIL/ACCURETIC.

PROCARDIA XL

IS A ONCE-A-DAY PRODUCT FOR HYPERTENSION AND

ANGINA. SALES OF

PROCARDIA XL

CONTINUED TO DECREASE DURING 2001 DUE TO GENERIC

COMPETITION.

CARDURA

IS USED TO TREAT HYPERTENSION AND BENIGN PROSTATIC

HYPERPLASIA (ENLARGED PROSTATE GLAND). SALES OF

CARDURA

DECLINED IN 2001 IN THE

U.S., WHERE OUR PATENT EXPIRED IN 2000.

CARDURA XL

, A SUSTAINED-RELEASE FORM OF

CARDURA

SOLD IN SEVERAL MAJOR EUROPEAN MARKETS, HAS BEEN FILED FOR APPROVAL IN

THE U.S. AND JAPAN.

ACCUPRIL/ACCURETIC

IS AN ANGIOTENSIN CONVERTING ENZYME (ACE)

DIFLUCAN

IS USED TO TREAT VARIOUS FUNGAL INFECTIONS, INCLUDING VAGINAL

INFECTIONS AND CERTAIN INFECTIONS THAT AFFLICT AIDS AND CANCER PATIENTS WITH

WEAKENED IMMUNE SYSTEMS. SALES OF

DIFLUCAN

INCREASED IN 2001 AFTER 13 YEARS ON

THE MARKET, REFLECTING THE PRODUCTS CONTINUING ACCEPTANCE AS THE THERAPY OF

CHOICE FOR A WIDE RANGE OF FUNGAL INFECTIONS. COMPLEMENTING

DIFLUCAN

IS

VFEND

, A

TREATMENT FOR SERIOUS FUNGAL INFECTIONS. IN MARCH 2002, BOTH THE ORAL AND

INTRAVENOUS FORMULATIONS OF

VFEND

WERE APPROVED FOR MARKETING IN THE EUROPEAN

UNION (EU) FOR THE TREATMENT OF POTENTIALLY FATAL FUNGAL INFECTIONS. WE RECEIVED

AN APPROVABLE LETTER FROM THE FDA FOR

VFEND

IN BOTH ORAL AND INTRAVENOUS

FORMULATIONS IN DECEMBER 2001. WHILE THERE IS NO ASSURANCE AS TO IF OR WHEN WE

WILL RECEIVE APPROVAL FROM THE FDA, WE EXPECT TO RECEIVE SUCH APPROVAL AND TO

BEGIN SELLING

VFEND

DURING 2002 IN THE U.S.

VIRACEPT

IS THE LARGEST-SELLING

PROTEASE INHIBITOR IN THE U.S., USED IN COMBINATION WITH OTHER ANTIRETROVIRAL

DRUGS FOR TREATMENT OF HIV INFECTIONS. SALES OF

VIRACEPT

DECLINED IN 2001

LARGELY DUE TO INCREASING COMPETITION FROM OTHER AIDS MEDICINES.

IN JUNE 1999, THE EUS COMMITTEE FOR PROPRIETARY MEDICINAL PRODUCTS

SUSPENDED THE EU LICENSES OF THE ORAL AND INTRAVENOUS FORMULATIONS OF OUR

ANTIBIOTIC

FOR AN INTRAMUSCULAR DOSAGE FORM OF

GEODON

, USED TO TREAT AGITATED OR

HOSPITALIZED PATIENTS. WE HAVE SUBMITTED ADDITIONAL DATA REQUESTED BY THE FDA ON

THIS FORMULATION, AND THE PRODUCT IS CURRENTLY UNDER REVIEW BY THE FDA. WE

EUROPEAN COUNTRIES IN MARCH 2002. WE CO-PROMOTE

ANIMAL HEALTH REVENUES ACCOUNTED FOR APPROXIMATELY 3% OF OUR REVENUES IN 2001,

4% IN 2000 AND 5% IN 1999. IN 2001, ANIMAL HEALTH REVENUES DECLINED 3%, TO $1.0

BILLION. EXCLUDING THE IMPACT OF FOREIGN EXCHANGE AND THE FEED-ADDITIVE PRODUCT

LINES THAT WERE SOLD IN NOVEMBER 2000, ANIMAL HEALTH REVENUES INCREASED 13% IN

2001. THE INCREASE WAS DUE TO THE INCREASED SALES OF

REVOLUTION

, AN

ANTI-PARASITIC FOR COMPANION ANIMALS, NEW PROMOTIONAL AND DISTRIBUTION PRACTICES

AS WELL AS VARIOUS RESTRUCTURING INITIATIVES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE IMPACT OF

MAD-COW AND FOOT-AND-MOUTH DISEASES IN EUROPE.

OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS WE HAVE SUBSTANTIALLY INCREASED OUR INVESTMENT IN

RESEARCH FOR ANIMAL HEALTH PRODUCTS. WE NOW HAVE OVER 40 PROGRAMS ADVANCING AT

VARIOUS STAGES OF DEVELOPMENT. EMERGING PRODUCTS FROM THIS INVESTMENT ARE

EXPECTED TO REACH THE MARKET STARTING IN 2004 AND DRIVE LONG-TERM GROWTH FOR THE

ANIMAL HEALTH GROUP.

PARASITICIDES CONSTITUTE THE LARGEST SEGMENT OF THE COMPANION

ANIMAL MARKET, CONSISTING MAINLY OF MEDICINES FOR EXTERNAL PARASITES, SUCH AS

FLEAS, AND HEARTWORM PREVENTATIVES. OUR PRODUCT

IS THE FIRST AND ONLY

TOPICAL MEDICINE THAT PROTECTS AGAINST FLEAS AND HEARTWORM IN A SIMPLE,

ONCE-A-MONTH ADMINISTRATION.

MANUFACTURING PRESCRIPTION AND OTC PHARMACEUTICALS AND NUTRITIONAL SUPPLEMENTS.

CAPSUGELS SALES ACCOUNTED FOR ABOUT 1% OF OUR REVENUES IN EACH OF 2001, 2000

AND 1999. IN 2001, CAPSUGELS SALES INCREASED 1%, TO $409 MILLION.

MARKETS MANY OF THE WORLDS BEST-KNOWN CONSUMER HEALTH BRANDS. SALES OF CHC

ACCOUNTED FOR ABOUT 8% OF OUR REVENUES IN EACH OF 2001 AND 2000 AND 9% IN 1999.

IN 2001, REVENUES OF CHC INCREASED 4%, ABOUT TWICE THE INDUSTRY GROWTH RATE,

MAINLY DUE TO INCREASED SALES OF

SUDAFED, BENADRYL

AND

LISTERINE

MOUTHWASH AND

THE SUCCESSFUL LAUNCH OF

LISTERINE POCKETPAKS

IN THE U.S. IN SEPTEMBER 2001,

PARTLY OFFSET BY THE NEGATIVE IMPACT OF FOREIGN EXCHANGE.

CHCS PRODUCTS INCLUDE OTC MEDICATIONS AND COMPETE PRIMARILY IN THE ORAL

2001 AND 7% IN EACH OF 2000 AND 1999. IN 2001, CONFECTIONERY SALES DECLINED 3%,

TO APPROXIMATELY $2.0 BILLION, PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASED COMPETITION, WEAKER

ECONOMIES IN EUROPE, CANADA AND OTHER MARKETS AND THE NEGATIVE IMPACT OF FOREIGN

EXCHANGE, PARTLY OFFSET BY THE STRONG PERFORMANCE OF

SUPPORTED BY OUR SUBSTANTIAL RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT INVESTMENTS. WE SPENT

APPROXIMATELY $4.8 BILLION IN 2001, $4.4 BILLION IN 2000 AND $4.0 BILLION IN

1999 ON RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, AND WE ANTICIPATE INVESTING APPROXIMATELY $5.3

BILLION ON RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT IN 2002.

WE ARE IN THE PROCESS OF SIGNIFICANTLY EXPANDING OUR RESEARCH AND

DEVELOPMENT OPERATIONS. IN 2001, WE ADDED APPROXIMATELY 2.4 MILLION SQUARE FEET

OF LABORATORY AND OFFICE SPACE AT THREE OF OUR MAJOR RESEARCH CENTERS. WE

CURRENTLY HAVE APPROXIMATELY 1.0 MILLION SQUARE FEET OF ADDITIONAL LABORATORY

AND OFFICE SPACE UNDER CONSTRUCTION AT TWO OF OUR MAJOR RESEARCH CENTERS. OTHER

RESEARCH FACILITIES ARE ALSO BEING ADDED OR EXPANDED.

WE CONDUCT RESEARCH INTERNALLY, AND ALSO THROUGH CONTRACTS WITH THIRD

PARTIES, THROUGH COLLABORATIONS WITH UNIVERSITIES AND BIOTECHNOLOGY COMPANIES

AND IN COOPERATION WITH OTHER PHARMACEUTICAL FIRMS. WE ALSO SEEK OUT INNOVATIVE

TECHNOLOGIES DEVELOPED BY THIRD PARTIES TO ACQUIRE OR INCORPORATE INTO OUR

PRODUCT LINES THROUGH LICENSING OR OTHER ARRANGEMENTS.

DRUG DEVELOPMENT IS TIME CONSUMING, EXPENSIVE AND UNPREDICTABLE. ON

AVERAGE, ONLY ONE OUT OF MANY THOUSANDS OF CHEMICAL COMPOUNDS DISCOVERED BY

RESEARCHERS PROVES TO BE BOTH MEDICALLY EFFECTIVE AND SAFE ENOUGH TO BECOME AN

APPROVED MEDICINE. THE PROCESS FROM DISCOVERY TO REGULATORY APPROVAL CAN TAKE

MORE THAN TEN YEARS. DRUG CANDIDATES CAN FAIL AT ANY STAGE OF THE PROCESS.

CANDIDATES MAY NOT RECEIVE REGULATORY APPROVAL EVEN AFTER MANY YEARS OF

RESEARCH, AND PRODUCTS THAT HAVE BEEN APPROVED AND MARKETED CAN BE ORDERED TO BE

WITHDRAWN FROM THE MARKET BY REGULATORY AUTHORITIES.

WE BELIEVE THAT OUR INVESTMENTS IN RESEARCH HAVE BEEN REWARDED BY THE

NUMBER OF PHARMACEUTICAL COMPOUNDS AND NEW THERAPIES WE HAVE IN ALL STAGES OF

DEVELOPMENT; WE CURRENTLY ARE WORKING ON MORE THAN 160 PROJECTS IN DEVELOPMENT

AND SEVERAL HUNDRED PROJECTS IN RESEARCH. IN RECENT YEARS, OUR DISCOVERY

SCIENTISTS HAVE DELIVERED DOZENS OF NEW CHEMICAL COMPOUNDS TO EARLY DEVELOPMENT.

WHILE EACH NEW CANDIDATE IS FAR FROM REGULATORY APPROVAL, NEW DRUG CANDIDATES

ARE THE FOUNDATION FOR FUTURE PRODUCTS.

OUR RESEARCH OPERATIONS ADD VALUE TO OUR EXISTING PRODUCTS BY IMPROVING

THEIR EFFECTIVENESS AND BY DISCOVERING NEW USES FOR THEM. IN 2001, FOR EXAMPLE,

THE FDA APPROVED THE ADDITIONAL USE OF

ZITHROMAX

AS A SINGLE-DOSE AND THREE-DAY

REGIMEN FOR ACUTE OTITIS MEDIA IN CHILDREN.

INFORMATION CONCERNING SEVERAL OF OUR DRUG CANDIDATES IN DEVELOPMENT AS

WELL AS SUPPLEMENTAL FILINGS FOR EXISTING PRODUCTS IS SET FORTH UNDER THE

HEADING

PRODUCT DEVELOPMENTS

ON PAGES 29 AND 30 OF OUR 2001 ANNUAL REPORT. THAT

INFORMATION IS INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE.

OUR COMPETITORS ALSO DEVOTE SUBSTANTIAL FUNDS AND RESOURCES TO RESEARCH

AND DEVELOPMENT. IN ADDITION, THE CONSOLIDATION THAT HAS OCCURRED IN OUR

INDUSTRY HAS CREATED COMPANIES WITH SUBSTANTIAL RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

RESOURCES. THE EXTENT TO WHICH OUR COMPETITORS ARE SUCCESSFUL IN THEIR RESEARCH

COULD RESULT IN EROSION OF SALES AND UNANTICIPATED PRODUCT OBSOLESCENCE.

INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS

WE HAVE SIGNIFICANT OPERATIONS OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES. THEY ARE

CONDUCTED BOTH THROUGH OUR SUBSIDIARIES AND THROUGH DISTRIBUTORS, AND INVOLVE

THE SAME BUSINESS SEGMENTS  PHARMACEUTICALS AND CONSUMER PRODUCTS  AS OUR U.S.

OPERATIONS.

REVENUES FROM OPERATIONS OUTSIDE THE U.S. OF $12.3 BILLION ACCOUNTED FOR

38% OF OUR TOTAL REVENUES IN 2001. REVENUES EXCEEDED $500 MILLION IN EACH OF

SEVEN COUNTRIES OUTSIDE THE U.S. IN 2001. NO SINGLE COUNTRY OUTSIDE THE U.S.

CONTRIBUTED MORE THAN 10% OF OUR TOTAL REVENUES. JAPAN IS OUR SECOND-LARGEST

SINGLE NATIONAL MARKET, WITH 7% OF OUR REVENUES IN EACH OF 2001 AND 2000 AND 6%

IN 1999.

OUR INTERNATIONAL BUSINESSES ARE SUBJECT, IN VARYING DEGREES, TO A NUMBER

OF RISKS INHERENT IN CARRYING ON BUSINESS IN OTHER COUNTRIES. THESE INCLUDE



CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS



CAPITAL AND EXCHANGE CONTROL REGULATIONS



EXPROPRIATION AND NATIONALIZATION



OTHER RESTRICTIVE GOVERNMENT ACTIONS

OUR INTERNATIONAL BUSINESSES ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO GOVERNMENT-IMPOSED CONSTRAINTS,

INCLUDING LAWS ON PRICING OR REIMBURSEMENT FOR USE OF PRODUCTS. SEE

GOVERNMENT

REGULATION AND PRICE CONSTRAINTS

BELOW FOR DISCUSSION OF THESE MATTERS.

DEPENDING ON THE DIRECTION OF CHANGE RELATIVE TO THE U.S. DOLLAR, FOREIGN

CURRENCY VALUES CAN EITHER IMPROVE OR REDUCE THE REPORTED DOLLAR VALUE OF OUR

NET ASSETS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. IN 2001, REVENUE GROWTH WAS NEGATIVELY

IMPACTED BY FOREIGN EXCHANGE, AS CURRENCY MOVEMENTS RELATIVE TO THE U.S. DOLLAR

REDUCED OUR REPORTED REVENUES IN MANY COUNTRIES. CHANGES IN FOREIGN EXCHANGE

RATES DECREASED TOTAL REVENUES BY $861 MILLION IN 2001. WHILE WE CANNOT PREDICT

WITH CERTAINTY FUTURE CHANGES IN FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES OR THE EFFECT THEY WILL

HAVE ON US, WE ATTEMPT TO MITIGATE THEIR IMPACT THROUGH OPERATIONAL MEANS AND BY

USING VARIOUS FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS. SEE NOTE 6-D TO OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS,

DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES

, ON PAGES 48 AND 49 OF

OUR 2001 ANNUAL REPORT. THAT DISCUSSION IS INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE. RELATED

INFORMATION ABOUT VALUATION AND RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH SUCH FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

IN PARTS E AND F OF THAT SAME NOTE IS ALSO INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE.

MARKETING

IN OUR GLOBAL PHARMACEUTICALS BUSINESS, WE PROMOTE OUR PRODUCTS TO HEALTH

CARE PROVIDERS SUCH AS DOCTORS, NURSE PRACTITIONERS, PHYSICIAN ASSISTANTS,

PHARMACISTS, HOSPITALS, PHARMACY BENEFIT MANAGERS (PBMS) AND MANAGED CARE

ORGANIZATIONS (MCOS). WE ALSO MARKET DIRECTLY TO CONSUMERS IN THE UNITED STATES

THROUGH DIRECT-TO-CONSUMER PRINT AND TELEVISION ADVERTISING. IN ADDITION, WE

SPONSOR GENERAL ADVERTISING TO EDUCATE THE PUBLIC ABOUT OUR INNOVATIVE MEDICAL

RESEARCH.

OUR OPERATIONS INCLUDE SEVERAL PHARMACEUTICAL SALES ORGANIZATIONS. EACH

SALES ORGANIZATION MARKETS A DISTINCT GROUP OF PRODUCTS.

OUR PRESCRIPTION PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS ARE SOLD PRINCIPALLY TO

WHOLESALERS, BUT WE ALSO SELL DIRECTLY TO RETAILERS, HOSPITALS, CLINICS,

GOVERNMENT AGENCIES AND PHARMACIES.

THROUGH OUR MARKETING ORGANIZATIONS, WE EXPLAIN THE APPROVED USES AND

ADVANTAGES OF OUR PRODUCTS TO MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS. WE WORK TO GAIN ACCESS TO

HEALTH AUTHORITY, PBM AND MCO FORMULARIES (LISTS OF RECOMMENDED OR APPROVED

MEDICINES AND OTHER PRODUCTS) AND REIMBURSEMENT LISTS BY DEMONSTRATING THE

QUALITIES AND TREATMENT BENEFITS OF OUR PRODUCTS. WE ALSO WORK WITH MCOS AND

PBMS TO ASSIST THEM WITH DISEASE MANAGEMENT, PATIENT EDUCATION AND OTHER TOOLS

THAT HELP THEIR MEDICAL TREATMENT ROUTINES. FOR EXAMPLE, IN 2001 WE ENTERED INTO

A PROGRAM WITH THE STATE OF FLORIDA AGENCY FOR HEALTH CARE ADMINISTRATION THAT

IS DESIGNED TO HELP MANAGE CHRONIC DISEASES AMONG FLORIDAS MEDICAID POPULATION.

MARKETING OF PRESCRIPTION PHARMACEUTICALS DEPENDS TO A DEGREE ON COMPLEX

DECISIONS ABOUT THE SCOPE OF CLINICAL TRIALS MADE YEARS BEFORE PRODUCT APPROVAL.

ALL DRUGS MUST COMPLETE CLINICAL TRIALS REQUIRED BY REGULATORY AUTHORITIES TO

SHOW THEY ARE SAFE AND EFFECTIVE FOR TREATING ONE OR MORE PARTICULAR MEDICAL

PROBLEMS. A MANUFACTURER MAY CHOOSE, HOWEVER, TO UNDERTAKE ADDITIONAL STUDIES,

INCLUDING COMPARATIVE CLINICAL TRIALS WITH COMPETITIVE PRODUCTS, TO DEMONSTRATE

ADDITIONAL ADVANTAGES OF A COMPOUND.

7

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THOSE STUDIES CAN BE COSTLY AND TAKE YEARS TO COMPLETE, AND THE RESULTS

ARE UNCERTAIN. BALANCING THESE CONSIDERATIONS MAKES IT DIFFICULT TO DECIDE

WHETHER AND WHEN TO UNDERTAKE SUCH ADDITIONAL STUDIES. BUT, WHEN THEY ARE

SUCCESSFUL, SUCH STUDIES CAN HAVE A MAJOR IMPACT ON APPROVED MARKETING CLAIMS

AND STRATEGIES.

SEPARATE SALES ORGANIZATIONS ARE USED BY OUR ANIMAL HEALTH BUSINESS TO

PROMOTE ITS PRODUCTS. ITS ADVERTISING AND PROMOTION ARE GENERALLY TARGETED TO

HEALTH PROFESSIONALS, DIRECTLY AND THROUGH MEDICAL JOURNALS. ANIMAL HEALTH AND

NUTRITION PRODUCTS ARE SOLD THROUGH VETERINARIANS, DRUG WHOLESALERS,

DISTRIBUTORS AND RETAIL OUTLETS AS WELL AS DIRECTLY TO USERS. WHERE APPROPRIATE,

THESE PRODUCTS ARE ALSO MARKETED THROUGH PRINT AND TELEVISION ADVERTISING.

OUR CONSUMER PRODUCTS BUSINESSES PRIMARILY USE THEIR OWN REPRESENTATIVES

TO DIRECTLY PROMOTE THEIR PRODUCTS. WE ALSO USE PRINT AND TELEVISION CONSUMER

ADVERTISING AND OFFER SALES INCENTIVES SUCH AS COUPONS TO PROMOTE OUR CONSUMER

PRODUCTS. THESE PRODUCTS ARE SOLD THROUGH VARIOUS RETAILERS.

DURING 2001, SALES TO OUR THREE LARGEST PHARMACEUTICAL AND CONSUMER HEALTHCARE

PRODUCTS WHOLESALERS WERE



MCKESSON, INC.  14.6% OF OUR REVENUES;



CARDINAL HEALTH, INC.  13.4% OF OUR REVENUES; AND



AMERISOURCEBERGEN CORPORATION  13.0% OF OUR REVENUES.

SALES TO THESE WHOLESALERS WERE CONCENTRATED IN THE PHARMACEUTICALS

SEGMENT. APART FROM THESE INSTANCES, NONE OF OUR BUSINESS SEGMENTS IS DEPENDENT

ON ANY ONE CUSTOMER OR GROUP OF RELATED CUSTOMERS.

PATENTS AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS

OUR PRODUCTS ARE SOLD AROUND THE WORLD UNDER BRAND-NAME, LOGO AND CERTAIN

PRODUCT DESIGN TRADEMARKS WE CONSIDER IN THE AGGREGATE TO BE OF MATERIAL

IMPORTANCE. TRADEMARK PROTECTION CONTINUES IN SOME COUNTRIES FOR AS LONG AS THE

MARK IS USED AND, IN OTHER COUNTRIES, FOR AS LONG AS IT IS REGISTERED.

REGISTRATIONS GENERALLY ARE FOR FIXED, BUT RENEWABLE, TERMS.

WE OWN OR LICENSE A NUMBER OF U.S. AND FOREIGN PATENTS. THESE PATENTS

COVER



PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS AND THEIR USES



PHARMACEUTICAL FORMULATIONS



PRODUCT MANUFACTURING PROCESSES



INTERMEDIATE CHEMICAL COMPOUNDS USED IN MANUFACTURING

PATENTS FOR INDIVIDUAL PRODUCTS EXTEND FOR VARYING PERIODS ACCORDING TO

THE DATE OF PATENT FILING OR GRANT AND THE LEGAL TERM OF PATENTS IN THE VARIOUS

COUNTRIES WHERE PATENT PROTECTION IS OBTAINED. THE ACTUAL PROTECTION AFFORDED BY

A PATENT, WHICH CAN VARY FROM COUNTRY TO COUNTRY, DEPENDS UPON THE TYPE OF

PATENT, THE SCOPE OF ITS COVERAGE AND THE AVAILABILITY OF LEGAL REMEDIES IN THE

COUNTRY.

IN THE AGGREGATE, OUR PATENT AND RELATED RIGHTS ARE OF MATERIAL IMPORTANCE

TO OUR BUSINESSES IN THE UNITED STATES AND MOST OTHER COUNTRIES. BASED ON

CURRENT PRODUCT SALES, AND CONSIDERING THE VIGOROUS COMPETITION WITH PRODUCTS

SOLD BY OTHERS, THE PATENT RIGHTS WE CONSIDER SIGNIFICANT IN RELATION TO OUR

BUSINESS AS A WHOLE, TOGETHER WITH THE YEAR IN WHICH THE BASIC U.S. PATENT

EXPIRES, ARE THOSE FOR THE FOLLOWING DRUGS.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

IN SOME INSTANCES, THERE ARE LATER EXPIRING PATENTS RELATING TO THESE PRODUCTS

DIRECTED TO PARTICULAR FORMS OR COMPOSITIONS OF THE DRUG OR TO METHODS OF

MANUFACTURING OR USING THE DRUG IN THE TREATMENT OF FURTHER DISEASES OR

CONDITIONS. SUCH PATENTS MAY NOT PROTECT THE COMPANYS DRUG FROM GENERIC DRUG

COMPETITION AFTER THE EXPIRATION OF THE BASIC PATENT.

ZITHROMAX

IS PATENTED BY PLIVA, A CROATIAN PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANY. THE

DRUG IS LICENSED EXCLUSIVELY TO US BY PLIVA FOR SALES AND MARKETING IN MAJOR

COUNTRIES, AND WE PURCHASE THE COMPOUND IN BULK CRUDE FORM FROM PLIVA.

CELEBREX

IS PATENTED BY PHARMACIA CORPORATION, WITH WHOM WE CO-PROMOTE

CELEBREX

IN ALL WORLD MARKETS EXCEPT JAPAN. AN ACTION ALLEGING PATENT

INFRINGEMENT WITH RESPECT TO THE SALE OF

CELEBREX

IS PENDING AGAINST PHARMACIA,

THE COMPANY AND OTHERS.

ZYRTEC

IS PATENTED BY THE BELGIAN COMPANY, UCB S.A., AND IS LICENSED TO US

FOR SALES IN THE U.S., CANADA, EUROPE, AUSTRALIA AND SOUTH AFRICA. WE CO-PROMOTE

ZYRTEC

AS A PRESCRIPTION MEDICINE IN THE U.S. WITH A SUBSIDIARY OF UCB S.A. AND

HAVE A LICENSE TO SELL

ZYRTEC

AS AN OTC MEDICINE IN THE OTHER MARKETS.

THE BASIC U.S. PATENTS RELATING TO

NEURONTIN

EXPIRED IN 1994 AND 2000.

HOWEVER, IN APRIL 2000, A BROAD U.S. PATENT WAS GRANTED RELATING TO STABLE

PHARMACEUTICAL COMPOSITIONS OF

NEURONTIN

CONTAINING LOW LEVELS OF LACTAM

IMPURITY. THIS PATENT EXPIRES IN 2017. OTHER COMPANIES HAVE FILED APPLICATIONS

WITH THE FDA SEEKING APPROVAL OF PRODUCTS THAT APPEAR TO INFRINGE THIS PATENT.

IN ADDITION, OTHER COMPANIES HAVE FILED APPLICATIONS WITH THE FDA SEEKING

APPROVAL OF PRODUCTS THAT APPEAR TO INFRINGE OUR PATENTS ON

ZOLOFT

,

DIFLUCAN

,

ACCUPRIL

,

GLUCOTROL XL

,

PROCARDIA XL

,

ESTROSTEP FE

AND

FEMHRT 1/5.

WE HAVE OTHER PATENT RIGHTS COVERING ADDITIONAL PRODUCTS THAT HAVE SMALLER

REVENUES.

WE EXPECT THAT THE PATENTS ON SOME OF OUR NEWEST PRODUCTS AND LATE-STAGE

PRODUCT CANDIDATES COULD BECOME SIGNIFICANT TO OUR BUSINESS AS A WHOLE IN THE

FUTURE.

THE EXPIRATION OF A PRODUCT PATENT OR LOSS OF PATENT PROTECTION RESULTING

FROM A LEGAL CHALLENGE NORMALLY RESULTS IN SIGNIFICANT COMPETITION FROM GENERIC

PRODUCTS AGAINST THE COVERED PRODUCT AND, PARTICULARLY IN THE U.S., CAN RESULT

IN A SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN SALES OF THE PIONEERING PRODUCT. IN SOME CASES,

HOWEVER, WE CAN CONTINUE TO OBTAIN COMMERCIAL BENEFITS FROM



PRODUCT MANUFACTURING TRADE SECRETS



PATENTS ON USES FOR PRODUCTS



PATENTS ON PROCESSES AND INTERMEDIATES FOR THE ECONOMICAL MANUFACTURE OF

THE ACTIVE INGREDIENTS



PATENTS FOR SPECIAL FORMULATIONS OF THE PRODUCT OR DELIVERY MECHANISMS



CONVERSION OF THE ACTIVE INGREDIENT TO OTC PRODUCTS

THE

EFFECT OF PRODUCT PATENT EXPIRATION OR LOSS ALSO DEPENDS UPON



THE NATURE OF THE MARKET AND THE POSITION OF THE PRODUCT IN IT



THE GROWTH OF THE MARKET



THE COMPLEXITIES AND ECONOMICS OF MANUFACTURE OF THE PRODUCT



THE REQUIREMENTS OF GENERIC DRUG LAWS

ONE OF THE MAIN LIMITATIONS ON OUR OPERATIONS IN SOME COUNTRIES OUTSIDE

THE U.S. IS THE LACK OF EFFECTIVE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY PROTECTION OF OUR

PRODUCTS. UNDER INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS IN RECENT YEARS, GLOBAL PROTECTION OF

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS IS IMPROVING. THE GENERAL AGREEMENT ON TARIFFS AND

TRADE REQUIRES PARTICIPANT COUNTRIES TO AMEND THEIR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY LAWS

TO PROVIDE PATENT PROTECTION FOR PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS BY THE END OF A

TEN-YEAR TRANSITION PERIOD. A NUMBER OF COUNTRIES ARE DOING THIS. WE HAVE

EXPERIENCED SIGNIFICANT GROWTH IN OUR BUSINESSES IN SOME OF THOSE NATIONS, AND

OUR CONTINUED BUSINESS EXPANSION IN THOSE COUNTRIES DEPENDS TO A LARGE DEGREE ON

FURTHER PATENT PROTECTION IMPROVEMENT.

COMPETITION

COMPETITION IS INTENSE IN ALL OF OUR BUSINESSES AND INCLUDES MANY LARGE

AND SMALL COMPETITORS.

THE PRINCIPAL MEANS OF COMPETITION VARY AMONG PRODUCT CATEGORIES AND

BUSINESS GROUPS. TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATIONS AFFECTING



EFFICACY



SAFETY



PATIENTS EASE OF USE



COST EFFECTIVENESS

ARE IMPORTANT TO SUCCESS IN ALL OF OUR BUSINESSES. OUR BUSINESSES ALSO FOCUS ON

UNMET MEDICAL NEEDS AND THERAPEUTIC IMPROVEMENTS. OUR EMPHASIS ON INNOVATION HAS

LED TO OUR MULTI-BILLION-DOLLAR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT INVESTMENTS OVER THE

PAST DECADE.

OUR HUMAN PHARMACEUTICAL BUSINESS COMPETES WITH OTHER WORLDWIDE

RESEARCH-BASED DRUG COMPANIES, MANY SMALLER RESEARCH COMPANIES WITH MORE LIMITED

THERAPEUTIC FOCUS AND GENERIC DRUG MANUFACTURERS. OUR PHARMACEUTICAL OPERATIONS

ARE AMONG THE LARGEST IN THE WORLD.

IN RECENT YEARS, A COMPARISON OF THE TOTAL COST OF MEDICAL TREATMENTS

USING PHARMACEUTICALS VERSUS ALTERNATIVE TREATMENTS FOR THE SAME CONDITION HAS

BECOME AN IMPORTANT BASIS OF COMPETITION. MCOS AND PBMS LOOK TO COST ADVANTAGES

AS WELL AS MEDICAL BENEFITS IN MAKING THEIR DRUG FORMULARY DECISIONS.

OUR PHARMACEUTICAL SALES AND MARKETING ORGANIZATION IS A VALUABLE

COMPETITIVE ASSET. OUR SALESPEOPLES ABILITY TO REACH MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS WITH

INFORMATION ABOUT OUR PRODUCTS HELPS US RESPOND TO COMPETITIVE EFFORTS AND

LAUNCH NEW PRODUCTS.

WE HAVE A SIGNIFICANT PRESENCE IN THE ANIMAL HEALTH MARKETPLACE, BUT MANY

OTHER COMPANIES OFFER COMPETITIVE PRODUCTS. ALTOGETHER, THERE ARE HUNDREDS OF

PRODUCERS OF ANIMAL HEALTH PRODUCTS THROUGHOUT THE WORLD. THE PRINCIPAL METHODS

OF COMPETITION VARY SOMEWHAT DEPENDING ON THE PARTICULAR PRODUCT. THEY INCLUDE



PRODUCT INNOVATION



SERVICE



PRICE



QUALITY



EFFECTIVE PROMOTION TO VETERINARY PROFESSIONALS AND CONSUMERS

WE PROMOTE OUR PRODUCTS DIRECTLY THROUGH OUR SALES REPRESENTATIVES AS WELL AS

THROUGH ADVERTISING.

MANY OTHER COMPANIES, LARGE AND SMALL, MANUFACTURE AND SELL ONE OR MORE

PRODUCTS THAT ARE SIMILAR TO OUR CONSUMER PRODUCTS. SOURCES OF COMPETITIVE

ADVANTAGE INCLUDE



PRODUCT QUALITY AND EFFICACY



BRAND IDENTITY



ADVERTISING AND PROMOTION



PRODUCT INNOVATION



BROAD DISTRIBUTION CAPABILITIES



CUSTOMER SATISFACTION



PRICE

SIGNIFICANT EXPENDITURES FOR ADVERTISING, PROMOTION AND MARKETING ARE GENERALLY

REQUIRED TO ACHIEVE BOTH CONSUMER AND TRADE ACCEPTANCE OF CONSUMER PRODUCTS.

IN THE CURRENT ENVIRONMENT OF COMPETITIVE PRESSURES ON PROFIT MARGINS, WE

CONTINUE EFFORTS TO CONTROL THE GROWTH OF OUR EXPENSES. WE HAVE KEPT OUR COSTS

DOWN IN AREAS SUCH AS MANUFACTURING, DISTRIBUTION AND SALES ADMINISTRATION BY

RESTRUCTURING AND CONSOLIDATING FACILITIES. THESE MEASURES HAVE BROUGHT US NEW

EFFICIENCIES AND REDUCED OR CONTAINED OUR OPERATING EXPENSES.

MANAGED CARE ORGANIZATIONS

THE GROWTH OF MCOS IN THE U.S. HAS BEEN A MAJOR FACTOR IN THE COMPETITIVE

MAKE-UP OF THE HEALTH CARE MARKETPLACE. OVER HALF THE U.S. POPULATION NOW

PARTICIPATES IN SOME VERSION OF MANAGED CARE. BECAUSE OF THE SIZE OF THE PATIENT

POPULATION COVERED BY MCOS, MARKETING OF PRESCRIPTION DRUGS TO THEM AND THE PBMS

THAT SERVE MANY OF THOSE ORGANIZATIONS HAS BECOME IMPORTANT TO OUR BUSINESS.

10

TABLE OF CONTENTS

MCOS CAN INCLUDE MEDICAL INSURANCE COMPANIES, MEDICAL PLAN ADMINISTRATORS,

HEALTH-MAINTENANCE ORGANIZATIONS, ALLIANCES OF HOSPITALS AND PHYSICIANS AND

OTHER PHYSICIAN ORGANIZATIONS. THE PURCHASING POWER OF MCOS HAS BEEN INCREASING

IN RECENT YEARS DUE TO THEIR GROWING NUMBERS OF ENROLLED PATIENTS. AT THE SAME

TIME, THOSE ORGANIZATIONS HAVE BEEN CONSOLIDATING INTO FEWER, EVEN LARGER

ENTITIES. THIS ENHANCES THEIR PURCHASING STRENGTH AND IMPORTANCE TO US.

A MAJOR OBJECTIVE OF MCOS IS TO CONTAIN AND, WHERE POSSIBLE, REDUCE HEALTH

CARE EXPENDITURES. THEY TYPICALLY USE FORMULARIES, VOLUME PURCHASES AND

LONG-TERM CONTRACTS TO NEGOTIATE DISCOUNTS FROM PHARMACEUTICAL PROVIDERS. THEY

USE THEIR PURCHASING POWER TO BARGAIN FOR LOWER SUPPLIER PRICES. THEY ALSO

EMPHASIZE PRIMARY AND PREVENTIVE CARE, OUT-PATIENT TREATMENT AND PROCEDURES

PERFORMED AT DOCTORS OFFICES AND CLINICS. HOSPITALIZATION AND SURGERY,

TYPICALLY THE MOST EXPENSIVE FORMS OF TREATMENT, ARE CAREFULLY MANAGED.

AS

DISCUSSED ABOVE IN

MARKETING

, MCOS AND PBMS TYPICALLY DEVELOP

FORMULARIES TO REDUCE THEIR COST FOR MEDICATIONS. FORMULARIES CAN BE BASED ON

THE PRICES AND THERAPEUTIC BENEFITS OF THE AVAILABLE PRODUCTS. DUE TO THEIR

GENERALLY LOWER COST, GENERIC MEDICINES ARE OFTEN FAVORED. THE BREADTH OF THE

PRODUCTS COVERED BY FORMULARIES CAN VARY CONSIDERABLY FROM ONE MCO TO ANOTHER,

AND MANY FORMULARIES INCLUDE ALTERNATIVE AND COMPETITIVE PRODUCTS FOR TREATMENT

OF PARTICULAR MEDICAL PROBLEMS. MCOS USE A VARIETY OF MEANS TO ENCOURAGE

PATIENTS USE OF PRODUCTS LISTED ON THEIR FORMULARIES.

EXCLUSION OF A PRODUCT FROM A FORMULARY CAN LEAD TO ITS SHARPLY REDUCED

USAGE IN THE MCO PATIENT POPULATION. CONSEQUENTLY, PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES

COMPETE AGGRESSIVELY TO HAVE THEIR PRODUCTS INCLUDED. WHERE POSSIBLE, COMPANIES

COMPETE FOR INCLUSION BASED UPON UNIQUE FEATURES OF THEIR PRODUCTS, SUCH AS

GREATER EFFICACY, BETTER PATIENT EASE OF USE OR FEWER SIDE EFFECTS. A LOWER

OVERALL COST OF THERAPY IS ALSO AN IMPORTANT FACTOR. PRODUCTS THAT DEMONSTRATE

FEWER THERAPEUTIC ADVANTAGES MUST COMPETE FOR INCLUSION BASED PRIMARILY ON

PRICE.

THE GROWTH OF MCOS ALSO APPEARS TO HAVE LED TO GREATER USAGE OF SOME

DRUGS. THE USE OF CERTAIN DRUGS CAN PREVENT THE NEED FOR MORE COSTLY TREATMENTS

SUCH AS HOSPITALIZATION, PROFESSIONAL THERAPY OR EVEN SURGERY. BECAUSE OF THESE

ADVANTAGES, SUCH DRUGS CAN BECOME FAVORED FIRST-LINE TREATMENTS. IN ADDITION,

THE CURRENT TREND OF SOME PATIENTS TO OPT FOR MANAGED CARE ALTERNATIVES TO

MEDICARE MAY INCREASE OVERALL PHARMACEUTICAL USAGE AMONG THAT SEGMENT OF THE

ELDERLY POPULATION. MEDICARE DOES NOT PAY FOR OUTPATIENT USE OF MEDICINES, SO

PATIENTS WHO DO NOT HAVE ANOTHER SOURCE OF PRESCRIPTION DRUG COVERAGE MUST BEAR

THAT COST. MCOS, HOWEVER, OFTEN OFFER DRUG BENEFITS FOR THEIR PARTICIPANTS.

THESE DEVELOPMENTS HAVE NOT ONLY CREATED PRESSURE ON PRICES, BUT ALSO HAVE

INCREASED SALES OF PRODUCTS ON FORMULARIES. WE HAVE BEEN GENERALLY, ALTHOUGH NOT

UNIVERSALLY, SUCCESSFUL IN HAVING OUR MAJOR PRODUCTS INCLUDED ON MCO

FORMULARIES.

ANOTHER WAY WE ADDRESS THE INTERESTS OF MCOS IS BY DEVELOPING DISEASE

MANAGEMENT PROGRAMS. THESE PROGRAMS CAN BE ATTRACTIVE TO MCOS BY IMPROVING

PATIENT COMMUNICATIONS AND COMPLIANCE WITH DOSAGE DIRECTIONS, WHICH ARE

IMPORTANT FOR EFFECTIVE DISEASE TREATMENT. THEY CAN HELP MCOS ADDRESS VARIOUS

ASPECTS OF DISEASE MANAGEMENT, SUCH AS PREVENTION, DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENT OF

CERTAIN DISEASES, INCLUDING USE OF PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS. THIS COMPREHENSIVE

APPROACH CAN IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF CARE AND LOWER COSTLY COMPLICATIONS OF

CHRONIC DISEASES. AS NOTED ABOVE IN

MARKETING

, ONE SUCH PROGRAM, WHICH WE

ENTERED INTO IN 2001 WITH THE STATE OF FLORIDA AGENCY FOR HEALTH CARE

ADMINISTRATION, IS DESIGNED TO HELP MANAGE CHRONIC DISEASES AMONG FLORIDAS

MEDICAID POPULATION.

GENERIC PRODUCTS

ONE OF THE BIGGEST COMPETITIVE CHALLENGES THAT WE FACE IN THE U.S. AND

THAT IS GROWING INTERNATIONALLY IS FROM GENERIC PHARMACEUTICAL MANUFACTURERS.

UPON THE EXPIRATION OR LOSS OF

11

TABLE OF CONTENTS

U.S. PATENT PROTECTION ON A PRODUCT, WE CAN LOSE THE MAJOR PORTION OF U.S. SALES

OF THAT PRODUCT WITHIN A YEAR. GENERIC COMPETITORS OPERATE WITHOUT OUR LARGE

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES AND OUR COSTS OF CONVEYING MEDICAL INFORMATION

ABOUT THE PRODUCT TO THE MEDICAL COMMUNITY. IN ADDITION, THE FDA APPROVAL

PROCESS EXEMPTS GENERICS FROM COSTLY AND TIME-CONSUMING CLINICAL TRIALS TO

DEMONSTRATE THEIR SAFETY AND EFFICACY, AND ALLOWS GENERIC MANUFACTURERS TO RELY

ON THE SAFETY AND EFFICACY OF THE PIONEER PRODUCT. GENERIC PRODUCTS NEED ONLY

DEMONSTRATE A LEVEL OF AVAILABILITY IN THE BLOODSTREAM EQUIVALENT TO THAT OF THE

PIONEER PRODUCT. THIS MEANS THAT AFTER WE HAVE BORNE THE EXPENSES OF

DISCOVERING, DEVELOPING AND TESTING A MEDICINE FOR SAFETY AND EFFICACY,

OBTAINING REGULATORY APPROVAL AND INFORMING THE MEDICAL COMMUNITY ABOUT ITS

THERAPEUTIC BENEFITS, GENERIC COMPETITORS CAN MARKET A COMPETING VERSION OF OUR

PRODUCT AFTER THE EXPIRATION OF OUR PATENT, CHARGE MUCH LESS AND STILL BE

PROFITABLE.

AS NOTED ABOVE, MCOS THAT FOCUS PRIMARILY ON THE IMMEDIATE COST OF DRUGS

OFTEN FAVOR GENERICS OVER BRAND-NAME DRUGS. MANY GOVERNMENTS ALSO ENCOURAGE THE

USE OF GENERICS AS ALTERNATIVES TO BRAND-NAME DRUGS IN THEIR HEALTH CARE

PROGRAMS, INCLUDING MEDICAID IN THE U.S. LAWS IN THE U.S. GENERALLY ALLOW, AND

IN SOME CASES REQUIRE, PHARMACISTS TO SUBSTITUTE GENERIC DRUGS THAT HAVE BEEN

RATED UNDER GOVERNMENT PROCEDURES TO BE THERAPEUTICALLY EQUIVALENT TO A

BRAND-NAME DRUG. THE SUBSTITUTION MUST BE MADE UNLESS THE PRESCRIBING PHYSICIAN

EXPRESSLY FORBIDS IT.

RAW MATERIALS

RAW MATERIALS ESSENTIAL TO OUR BUSINESSES ARE PURCHASED WORLDWIDE IN THE

ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS FROM NUMEROUS SUPPLIERS. IN GENERAL, THESE MATERIALS

ARE AVAILABLE FROM MULTIPLE SOURCES. NO SERIOUS SHORTAGES OR DELAYS WERE

ENCOUNTERED IN 2001, AND NONE ARE EXPECTED IN 2002.

GOVERNMENT REGULATION AND PRICE CONSTRAINTS

PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES ARE SUBJECT TO EXTENSIVE REGULATION BY NUMEROUS

NATIONAL, STATE AND LOCAL AGENCIES. OF PARTICULAR IMPORTANCE IS THE

FDA IN THE UNITED STATES. IT

HAS JURISDICTION OVER VIRTUALLY ALL OF OUR BUSINESSES AND ADMINISTERS

REQUIREMENTS COVERING THE TESTING, SAFETY, EFFECTIVENESS, APPROVAL,

MANUFACTURING, LABELING, MARKETING, ADVERTISING AND POST-MARKETING SURVEILLANCE

OF OUR PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS. FDA REQUIREMENTS AND/OR REVIEWS HAVE INCREASED

THE AMOUNT OF TIME AND MONEY NECESSARY TO DEVELOP NEW PRODUCTS AND BRING THEM TO

MARKET.

THE FDA ALSO REGULATES MOST OF OUR CONSUMER PRODUCTS AND, ALONG WITH THE

U.S. DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE AND THE U.S. ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY, OUR

ANIMAL HEALTH PRODUCTS.

SINCE 1998, THE APPROVAL OF NEW DRUGS ACROSS THE EU IS POSSIBLE ONLY USING

THE EUROPEAN MEDICINES EVALUATION AGENCYS (EMEA) MUTUAL RECOGNITION OR CENTRAL

APPROVAL PROCESSES. THE USE OF EITHER OF THESE PROCEDURES PROVIDES A MORE RAPID

AND CONSISTENT APPROVAL WITHIN THE 15 MEMBER STATES THAN WAS THE CASE WHEN THE

APPROVAL PROCESSES WERE OPERATING INDEPENDENTLY WITHIN EACH MEMBER STATE.

FURTHER, ON JANUARY 1, 2000, NORWAY AND ICELAND BECAME FULL PARTICIPANTS IN THE

EU CENTRAL APPROVAL PROCESSES. IN ADDITION, THE AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE EU AND 12

OTHER EUROPEAN STATES TO BASE THEIR APPROVALS ON THE CENTRALIZED EU APPROVAL

WILL SIGNIFICANTLY SPEED THE REGULATORY PROCESS IN THOSE COUNTRIES. THE EMEA

DOES NOT HAVE JURISDICTION OVER PATIENT REIMBURSEMENT OR PRICING MATTERS IN EU

MEMBER COUNTRIES, HOWEVER. WE CONTINUE TO DEAL WITH INDIVIDUAL COUNTRIES ON SUCH

ISSUES.

IN RECENT YEARS IN THE U.S., VARIOUS LEGISLATIVE PROPOSALS HAVE BEEN

OFFERED AT THE FEDERAL AND STATE LEVELS THAT WOULD BRING ABOUT MAJOR CHANGES IN

THE AFFECTED HEALTH CARE SYSTEMS. SOME STATES HAVE PASSED SUCH LEGISLATION, AND

FURTHER FEDERAL AND STATE PROPOSALS ARE POSSIBLE. SUCH PROPOSALS AND

12

TABLE OF CONTENTS

LEGISLATION INCLUDE, AND FUTURE PROPOSALS COULD INCLUDE, PRICE OR PATIENT

REIMBURSEMENT CONSTRAINTS ON MEDICINES, INCREASES IN REQUIRED REBATES OR

DISCOUNTS AND RESTRICTIONS ON ACCESS TO CERTAIN PRODUCTS. SIMILAR ISSUES EXIST

IN MANY FOREIGN COUNTRIES WHERE WE DO BUSINESS. WE CANNOT PREDICT THE OUTCOME OF

SUCH INITIATIVES, BUT WE WILL WORK TO MAINTAIN PATIENT ACCESS TO OUR PRODUCTS

AND TO OPPOSE PRICE CONSTRAINTS.

IN THE U.S., FEDERAL PROPOSALS HAVE CALLED FOR SUBSTANTIAL CHANGES IN THE

MEDICARE PROGRAM, AND FEDERAL AND STATE PROPOSALS HAVE CALLED FOR SUBSTANTIAL

CHANGES IN THE MEDICAID PROGRAM. IF SUCH CHANGES ARE ENACTED, THEY MAY REQUIRE

SIGNIFICANT REDUCTIONS FROM CURRENTLY PROJECTED GOVERNMENT EXPENDITURES FOR

THESE PROGRAMS. DRIVEN BY BUDGET CONCERNS, MEDICAID MANAGED CARE SYSTEMS HAVE

BEEN IMPLEMENTED IN MANY STATES. IF THE MEDICARE AND MEDICAID PROGRAMS IMPLEMENT

CHANGES THAT RESTRICT THE ACCESS OF A SIGNIFICANT POPULATION OF PATIENTS TO OUR

INNOVATIVE MEDICINES, OUR BUSINESS COULD BE MATERIALLY AFFECTED. ON THE OTHER

HAND, RELATIVELY LITTLE PHARMACEUTICAL USE IS CURRENTLY COVERED BY MEDICARE. IF

CHANGES TO THESE PROGRAMS SHIFT PATIENTS TO MCOS THAT COVER PHARMACEUTICALS, OR

IF AN OUTPATIENT DRUG BENEFIT IS ADDED TO MEDICARE, USAGE OF PHARMACEUTICALS

COULD INCREASE. PRICING PRESSURES LIKELY WOULD ENSUE IN EITHER CASE GIVEN THE

ENHANCEMENT OF THE PURCHASING POWER OF THE MCOS OR THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT.

MEDICARE CURRENTLY DOES NOT PROVIDE OUTPATIENT PRESCRIPTION DRUG COVERAGE.

IN THIS CONTEXT, IN ORDER TO HELP ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF AFFORDABLE ACCESS TO

HEALTH CARE FOR THOSE MOST IN NEED, WE ANNOUNCED THE PFIZER FOR LIVING SHARE

CARD PROGRAM IN JANUARY 2002. THROUGH THIS PROGRAM, LOW-INCOME MEDICARE

RECIPIENTS WITHOUT PRESCRIPTION DRUG COVERAGE CAN PURCHASE A 30-DAY SUPPLY OF A

PFIZER PRESCRIPTION MEDICINE AND OF THE CO-PROMOTED PRODUCTS

ZYRTEC

AND

ARICEPT

AT MANY RETAIL PHARMACIES FOR $15.

U.S. LAW REQUIRES US TO GIVE REBATES TO STATE MEDICAID AGENCIES BASED ON

EACH STATES REIMBURSEMENT OF PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS UNDER THE MEDICAID

PROGRAM. SOME STATES ARE SEEKING REBATES IN EXCESS OF THE AMOUNTS REQUIRED BY

FEDERAL LAW. WE ALSO MUST GIVE DISCOUNTS OR REBATES ON PURCHASES OR

REIMBURSEMENTS OF PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS BY CERTAIN OTHER FEDERAL AND STATE

AGENCIES AND PROGRAMS. ALSO, IN LATE 2000 AND EARLY 2001, THE STATES OF VERMONT

AND MAINE RECEIVED CENTERS FOR MEDICARE AND MEDICAID SERVICES APPROVAL OF

WAIVERS THAT WOULD EXPAND MEDICAID REBATES BEYOND THE CURRENT MEDICAID

POPULATION. BOTH OF THESE WAIVERS HAVE BEEN CHALLENGED IN COURT. THE VERMONT

PROGRAM WAS STRUCK DOWN BY A FEDERAL APPEALS COURT IN 2001. THE MAINE PROGRAM

WAS UPHELD BY A FEDERAL DISTRICT COURT IN FEBRUARY 2002; AN APPEAL OF THAT

DECISION IS EXPECTED. IF THE MAINE PROGRAM IS UPHELD ON APPEAL, OTHER STATES MAY

SEEK SIMILAR APPROVAL OF WAIVERS THAT WOULD EXPAND MEDICAID REBATES BEYOND THE

CURRENT MEDICAID POPULATION. REBATES POTENTIALLY COULD BE VIEWED AS PRICE

DISCOUNTS WITHOUT APPRECIABLE INCREASES IN VOLUME AS AN OFFSET. SEE THE

DISCUSSION REGARDING REBATES ON PAGE 27 OF OUR 2001 ANNUAL REPORT, WHICH

DISCUSSION IS INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE.

WE ENCOUNTER SIMILAR REGULATORY AND LEGISLATIVE ISSUES IN MOST OTHER

COUNTRIES. IN EUROPE AND SOME OTHER INTERNATIONAL MARKETS, THE GOVERNMENT

PROVIDES HEALTH CARE AT LOW DIRECT COST TO CONSUMERS AND REGULATES

PHARMACEUTICAL PRICES OR PATIENT REIMBURSEMENT LEVELS TO CONTROL COSTS FOR THE

GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED HEALTH CARE SYSTEM. THIS INTERNATIONAL PATCHWORK OF PRICE

REGULATION HAS LED TO INCONSISTENT PRICES AND SOME THIRD-PARTY TRADE IN OUR

PRODUCTS FROM MARKETS WITH LOWER PRICES. SUCH TRADE EXPLOITING PRICE DIFFERENCES

BETWEEN COUNTRIES CAN UNDERMINE OUR SALES IN MARKETS WITH HIGHER PRICES.

IN ADDITION TO THE FDA, THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE AND THE U.S.

ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY, WE ARE SUBJECT TO THE JURISDICTION OF VARIOUS

OTHER REGULATORY AND ENFORCEMENT DEPARTMENTS AND AGENCIES, SUCH AS THE

DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES, THE FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION AND THE

DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE IN THE U.S. WE ARE, THEREFORE, SUBJECT TO POSSIBLE

ADMINISTRATIVE AND LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND ACTIONS BY THOSE

13

TABLE OF CONTENTS

REGULATORY BODIES (SEE ITEM 3,

LEGAL

PROCEEDINGS

, BELOW). SUCH ACTIONS MAY

INCLUDE PRODUCT RECALLS, SEIZURES AND OTHER CIVIL AND CRIMINAL SANCTIONS. IN

SOME CASES, WE HAVE INITIATED PRODUCT RECALLS VOLUNTARILY.

FOLLOWING THE SEPTEMBER 11, 2001 TERRORIST ATTACKS, THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT

REQUESTED ASSISTANCE FROM PFIZER AND OTHER PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES IN

CONNECTION WITH THE THREAT OF BIOTERRORISM. IN RESPONSE, WE HAVE CONTRIBUTED

PFIZER ANTIBIOTICS TO THE U.S. NATIONAL STOCKPILE AND COORDINATED WITH

AUTHORITIES TO ENSURE SUPPLIES OF ESSENTIAL PHARMACEUTICALS.

IT IS DIFFICULT TO PREDICT THE FUTURE IMPACT OF THE BROAD AND EXPANDING

LEGISLATIVE AND REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS AFFECTING US.

ENVIRONMENTAL LAW COMPLIANCE

MOST OF OUR MANUFACTURING AND CERTAIN RESEARCH OPERATIONS ARE AFFECTED BY

FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS. WE HAVE MADE, AND INTEND TO

CONTINUE TO MAKE, NECESSARY EXPENDITURES FOR COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE LAWS. WE

ARE ALSO CLEANING UP ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINATION FROM PAST INDUSTRIAL ACTIVITY

AT CERTAIN SITES (SEE ITEM 3,

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

, BELOW). AS A RESULT, WE

INCURRED CAPITAL AND OPERATIONAL EXPENDITURES IN 2001 FOR ENVIRONMENTAL

PROTECTION AND CLEAN-UP OF CERTAIN PAST INDUSTRIAL ACTIVITY AS FOLLOWS.



ENVIRONMENTAL-RELATED CAPITAL EXPENDITURES  $83 MILLION



OTHER ENVIRONMENTAL-RELATED EXPENSES  $121 MILLION

WHILE WE CANNOT PREDICT WITH CERTAINTY THE FUTURE COSTS OF SUCH CLEAN-UP

ACTIVITIES, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES OR OPERATING COSTS FOR ENVIRONMENTAL

COMPLIANCE, WE DO NOT BELIEVE THEY WILL HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON OUR CAPITAL

EXPENDITURES, EARNINGS OR COMPETITIVE POSITION.

BANKING AND INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES

WE CONDUCT INTERNATIONAL BANKING OPERATIONS THROUGH A SUBSIDIARY, PFIZER

INTERNATIONAL BANK EUROPE (PIBE), BASED IN DUBLIN, IRELAND. PIBE, INCORPORATED

UNDER THE LAWS OF IRELAND, OPERATES UNDER A BANKING LICENSE FROM THE CENTRAL

BANK OF IRELAND. IT MAKES LOANS AND ACCEPTS DEPOSITS IN SEVERAL CURRENCIES IN

INTERNATIONAL MARKETS. PIBE IS AN ACTIVE EUROMARKET LENDER TO HIGH QUALITY

CORPORATIONS AND GOVERNMENTS THROUGH ITS PORTFOLIO OF LOANS AND MONEY MARKET

INSTRUMENTS. LOANS ARE MADE PRIMARILY ON A SHORT AND MEDIUM TERM BASIS,

TYPICALLY WITH FLOATING INTEREST RATES.

WE ALSO OWN AN INSURANCE OPERATION, THE KODIAK COMPANY LIMITED, WHICH

REINSURES CERTAIN ASSETS, INLAND TRANSPORT AND MARINE CARGO OF OUR INTERNATIONAL

OPERATIONS.

FINANCIAL DATA FOR THESE SUBSIDIARIES ARE SET FORTH IN NOTE 5 TO OUR

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS,

BANKING AND INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES

, ON PAGE 46 OF OUR 2001

ANNUAL REPORT, AND INFORMATION RELATING TO OUR BANKING OPERATIONS IS SET FORTH

UNDER THE HEADING

BANKING OPERATION

ON PAGE 33 OF OUR 2001 ANNUAL REPORT. SUCH

DATA AND INFORMATION ARE INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE.

TAX MATTERS

THE DISCUSSION OF TAX-RELATED MATTERS (INCLUDING CERTAIN PROCEEDINGS

INVOLVING PROPOSED TAX ADJUSTMENTS RELATING TO PRIOR YEARS) IN NOTE 11 TO OUR

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS,

, ON PAGES 50 AND 51 OF OUR 2001 ANNUAL

REPORT IS INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE.

EMPLOYEES

IN OUR INNOVATION-INTENSIVE BUSINESS, OUR EMPLOYEES ARE VITAL TO OUR

SUCCESS. WE BELIEVE WE HAVE GOOD RELATIONSHIPS WITH OUR EMPLOYEES. AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2001, WE EMPLOYED APPROXIMATELY 90,000 PEOPLE IN OUR OPERATIONS

THROUGHOUT THE WORLD.

CAUTIONARY FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT FUTURE RESULTS

(CAUTIONARY STATEMENTS UNDER THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995)

OUR DISCLOSURE AND ANALYSIS IN THIS REPORT AND IN OUR 2001 ANNUAL REPORT TO

SHAREHOLDERS CONTAIN SOME FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS THAT

14

TABLE OF CONTENTS

SET FORTH ANTICIPATED RESULTS BASED ON MANAGEMENTS PLANS AND ASSUMPTIONS. FROM

TIME TO TIME, WE ALSO PROVIDE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS IN OTHER MATERIALS WE

RELEASE TO THE PUBLIC AS WELL AS ORAL FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS. SUCH

STATEMENTS GIVE OUR CURRENT EXPECTATIONS OR FORECASTS OF FUTURE EVENTS; THEY DO

NOT RELATE STRICTLY TO HISTORICAL OR CURRENT FACTS. WE HAVE TRIED, WHEREVER

POSSIBLE, TO IDENTIFY SUCH STATEMENTS BY USING WORDS SUCH AS ANTICIPATE,

ESTIMATE, EXPECT, PROJECT, INTEND, PLAN, BELIEVE AND WORDS AND TERMS

OF SIMILAR SUBSTANCE IN CONNECTION WITH ANY DISCUSSION OF FUTURE OPERATING OR

FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE. IN PARTICULAR, THESE INCLUDE STATEMENTS RELATING TO

FUTURE ACTIONS, PROSPECTIVE PRODUCTS OR PRODUCT APPROVALS, FUTURE PERFORMANCE OR

RESULTS OF CURRENT AND ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS, SALES EFFORTS, EXPENSES, INTEREST

RATES, FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES, THE OUTCOME OF CONTINGENCIES, SUCH AS LEGAL

PROCEEDINGS, AND FINANCIAL RESULTS.

WE CANNOT GUARANTEE THAT ANY FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENT WILL BE REALIZED,

ALTHOUGH WE BELIEVE WE HAVE BEEN PRUDENT IN OUR PLANS AND ASSUMPTIONS.

ACHIEVEMENT OF FUTURE RESULTS IS SUBJECT TO RISKS, UNCERTAINTIES AND INACCURATE

ASSUMPTIONS. SHOULD KNOWN OR UNKNOWN RISKS OR UNCERTAINTIES MATERIALIZE, OR

SHOULD UNDERLYING ASSUMPTIONS PROVE INACCURATE, ACTUAL RESULTS COULD VARY

MATERIALLY FROM THOSE ANTICIPATED, ESTIMATED OR PROJECTED. INVESTORS SHOULD BEAR

THIS IN MIND AS THEY CONSIDER FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS.

WE UNDERTAKE NO OBLIGATION TO PUBLICLY UPDATE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS,

WHETHER AS A RESULT OF NEW INFORMATION, FUTURE EVENTS OR OTHERWISE. YOU ARE

ADVISED, HOWEVER, TO CONSULT ANY FURTHER DISCLOSURES WE MAKE ON RELATED SUBJECTS

IN OUR 10-Q AND 8-K REPORTS TO THE SEC. ALSO NOTE THAT WE PROVIDE THE FOLLOWING

CAUTIONARY DISCUSSION OF RISKS, UNCERTAINTIES AND POSSIBLY INACCURATE

ASSUMPTIONS RELEVANT TO OUR BUSINESSES. THESE ARE FACTORS THAT, INDIVIDUALLY OR

IN THE AGGREGATE, WE THINK COULD CAUSE OUR ACTUAL RESULTS TO DIFFER MATERIALLY

FROM EXPECTED AND HISTORICAL RESULTS. WE NOTE THESE FACTORS FOR INVESTORS AS

PERMITTED BY THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995. YOU SHOULD

UNDERSTAND THAT IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO PREDICT OR IDENTIFY ALL SUCH FACTORS.

CONSEQUENTLY, YOU SHOULD NOT CONSIDER THE FOLLOWING TO BE A COMPLETE DISCUSSION

OF ALL POTENTIAL RISKS OR UNCERTAINTIES.

       BALANCING CURRENT GROWTH AND INVESTMENT FOR THE FUTURE REMAINS A MAJOR

CHALLENGE. OUR ONGOING INVESTMENTS IN NEW PRODUCT INTRODUCTIONS AND RESEARCH AND

DEVELOPMENT FOR FUTURE PRODUCTS COULD EXCEED CORRESPONDING SALES GROWTH. THIS

COULD PRODUCE HIGHER COSTS WITHOUT A PROPORTIONAL INCREASE IN REVENUES.

       IN THE U.S., MANY PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS ARE SUBJECT TO INCREASING PRICING

PRESSURES, WHICH COULD BE SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACTED BY THE OUTCOME OF THE CURRENT

NATIONAL DEBATE OVER MEDICARE REFORM. IF THE MEDICARE PROGRAM PROVIDED

OUTPATIENT PHARMACEUTICAL COVERAGE FOR ITS BENEFICIARIES, THE FEDERAL

GOVERNMENT, THROUGH ITS ENORMOUS PURCHASING POWER UNDER THE PROGRAM, COULD

DEMAND DISCOUNTS FROM PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES THAT MAY IMPLICITLY CREATE PRICE

CONTROLS ON PRESCRIPTION DRUGS. ON THE OTHER HAND, A MEDICARE DRUG REIMBURSEMENT

PROVISION MAY INCREASE THE VOLUME OF PHARMACEUTICAL DRUG PURCHASES, OFFSETTING

AT LEAST IN PART THESE POTENTIAL PRICE DISCOUNTS. IN ADDITION, MCOS,

INSTITUTIONS AND OTHER GOVERNMENT AGENCIES CONTINUE TO SEEK PRICE DISCOUNTS.

GOVERNMENT EFFORTS TO REDUCE MEDICARE AND MEDICAID EXPENSES ARE EXPECTED TO

INCREASE THE USE OF MCOS. THIS MAY RESULT IN MANAGED CARES INFLUENCING

PRESCRIPTION DECISIONS FOR A LARGER SEGMENT OF THE POPULATION. IN ADDITION,

CERTAIN STATES HAVE PROPOSED AND CERTAIN OTHER STATES HAVE ADOPTED VARIOUS

PROGRAMS TO CONTROL PRICES FOR THEIR SENIORS DRUG PROGRAMS, INCLUDING PRICE OR

PATIENT REIMBURSEMENT CONSTRAINTS, RESTRICTIONS ON ACCESS TO CERTAIN PRODUCTS,

IMPORTATION FROM OTHER COUNTRIES AND BULK PURCHASING OF DRUGS.

WE ENCOUNTER SIMILAR REGULATORY AND LEGISLATIVE ISSUES IN MOST OTHER

COUNTRIES. IN EUROPE AND SOME OTHER INTERNATIONAL MARKETS, THE GOVERNMENT

PROVIDES HEALTH CARE AT LOW DIRECT COST TO CONSUMERS AND REGULATES

PHARMACEUTICAL PRICES OR PATIENT REIMBURSEMENT

15

TABLE OF CONTENTS

LEVELS TO CONTROL COSTS FOR THE GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED HEALTH CARE SYSTEM. THIS

INTERNATIONAL PATCHWORK OF PRICE REGULATION HAS LED TO INCONSISTENT PRICES AND

SOME THIRD-PARTY TRADE IN OUR PRODUCTS FROM MARKETS WITH LOWER PRICES. SUCH

TRADE EXPLOITING PRICE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN COUNTRIES CAN UNDERMINE OUR SALES IN

MARKETS WITH HIGHER PRICES.

AS A RESULT, IT IS EXPECTED THAT PRESSURES ON THE PRICING COMPONENT OF

OPERATING RESULTS WILL CONTINUE.

       THIRTY-EIGHT PERCENT OF OUR 2001 REVENUES AROSE FROM INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS,

INCLUDING 7% FROM JAPAN, AND WE EXPECT REVENUE AND NET INCOME GROWTH IN 2002 TO

BE IMPACTED BY CHANGES IN FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES.

THESE INTERNATIONAL-BASED REVENUES AS WELL AS OUR SUBSTANTIAL

INTERNATIONAL ASSETS RESULT IN OUR EXPOSURE TO CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE CHANGES.

IN ADDITION, OUR INTEREST-BEARING INVESTMENTS, LOANS AND BORROWINGS ARE SUBJECT

TO INTEREST RATE CHANGE RISK. THE RISKS OF SUCH CHANGES AND THE MEASURES WE HAVE

TAKEN TO HELP CONTAIN THOSE RISKS ARE DISCUSSED IN THE SECTION ENTITLED

FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT

ON PAGE 35 OF OUR 2001 ANNUAL REPORT. FOR ADDITIONAL

DETAILS, SEE NOTE 6-D TO OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS,

DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL

INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES,

ON PAGES 48 AND 49 OF OUR 2001 ANNUAL

REPORT. THOSE SECTIONS OF OUR 2001 ANNUAL REPORT ARE INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE.

NOTWITHSTANDING OUR EFFORTS TO FORESEE AND MITIGATE THE EFFECTS OF CHANGES

IN FISCAL CIRCUMSTANCES, WE CANNOT PREDICT WITH CERTAINTY ALL CHANGES IN

CURRENCY AND INTEREST RATES, INFLATION OR OTHER RELATED FACTORS AFFECTING OUR

BUSINESSES.

       A EUROPEAN CURRENCY (EURO) WAS INTRODUCED IN JANUARY 1999 TO REPLACE THE

SEPARATE CURRENCIES OF 12 INDIVIDUAL COUNTRIES AND DID REPLACE SUCH CURRENCIES

ON JANUARY 1, 2002. WE MODIFIED SYSTEMS AND COMMERCIAL ARRANGEMENTS TO DEAL WITH

THE NEW CURRENCY, INCLUDING THE AVAILABILITY OF DUAL CURRENCY PROCESSES TO

PERMIT TRANSACTIONS TO BE DENOMINATED IN LEGACY CURRENCIES, AS WELL AS THE EURO,

DURING THE 1999-2001 TRANSITION PERIOD. THE COST OF THIS EFFORT WAS NOT MATERIAL

TO OUR FINANCIAL POSITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. WE CONTINUE TO EVALUATE THE

ECONOMIC AND OPERATIONAL IMPACT OF THE EURO, INCLUDING ITS IMPACT ON

COMPETITION, PRICING AND FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RISKS.

       INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS COULD BE AFFECTED BY CHANGES IN INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

LEGAL PROTECTIONS AND REMEDIES, TRADE REGULATIONS AND PROCEDURES AND ACTIONS

AFFECTING APPROVAL, PRODUCTION, PRICING, REIMBURSEMENT AND MARKETING OF

PRODUCTS, AS WELL AS BY UNSTABLE GOVERNMENTS AND LEGAL SYSTEMS,

INTERGOVERNMENTAL DISPUTES AND POSSIBLE NATIONALIZATION.

       COST-CONTAINMENT MEASURES EMPLOYED BY GOVERNMENTS THAT HAVE THE EFFECT OF

LIMITING PATIENT ACCESS TO MEDICINES AND RELATED ISSUES DESCRIBED ABOVE IN

GOVERNMENT REGULATION AND PRICE CONSTRAINTS

AFFECT THE GROWTH AND PROFITABILITY

OF OUR OPERATIONS IN SOME COUNTRIES.

       BUSINESS COMBINATIONS AMONG OUR COMPETITORS COULD AFFECT OUR COMPETITIVE

POSITION IN THE PHARMACEUTICAL, CONSUMER PRODUCTS AND ANIMAL HEALTH BUSINESSES.

SIMILARLY, COMBINATIONS AMONG OUR MAJOR CUSTOMERS COULD INCREASE THEIR

PURCHASING POWER IN DEALING WITH US.

       COMPETITION FROM MANUFACTURERS OF GENERIC DRUGS IS A MAJOR CHALLENGE IN THE

U.S. AND IS GROWING INTERNATIONALLY. LOSS OF PATENT PROTECTION TYPICALLY LEADS

TO SIGNIFICANT LOSS OF SALES IN THE U.S. MARKET. THE PATENTS COVERING SEVERAL OF

THE COMPANYS MEDICINES ARE BEING CHALLENGED BY GENERIC DRUG MANUFACTURERS.

16

TABLE OF CONTENTS

       RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES PARTICULARLY APPLY WITH RESPECT TO PRODUCT-RELATED

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS. THE OUTCOME OF THE LENGTHY AND COMPLEX PROCESS OF

IDENTIFYING NEW COMPOUNDS AND DEVELOPING NEW PRODUCTS IS INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN.

THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE AS TO IF OR WHEN WE WILL RECEIVE REGULATORY APPROVAL

FOR NEW PRODUCTS OR FOR NEW INDICATIONS OR DOSAGE FORMS FOR EXISTING PRODUCTS.

THERE ARE ALSO MANY CONSIDERATIONS THAT CAN AFFECT MARKETING OF PHARMACEUTICAL

PRODUCTS AROUND THE WORLD. REGULATORY DELAYS, THE INABILITY TO SUCCESSFULLY

COMPLETE CLINICAL TRIALS, CLAIMS AND CONCERNS ABOUT SAFETY AND EFFICACY, NEW

DISCOVERIES, PATENT DISPUTES AND CLAIMS ABOUT ADVERSE SIDE EFFECTS ARE A FEW OF

THE FACTORS THAT COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE REALIZATION OF RESEARCH AND

DEVELOPMENT AND PRODUCT-RELATED FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS.

       AS DISCUSSED ABOVE IN

MARKETING

, DECISIONS ABOUT RESEARCH STUDIES MADE EARLY

IN THE DEVELOPMENT PROCESS OF A DRUG CANDIDATE CAN HAVE A SUBSTANTIAL IMPACT ON

THE MARKETING STRATEGY ONCE THE DRUG RECEIVES APPROVAL. MORE DETAILED STUDIES

MAY DEMONSTRATE ADDITIONAL BENEFITS THAT CAN HELP IN THE MARKETING, BUT THEY

CONSUME TIME AND RESOURCES AND CAN DELAY SUBMITTING THE DRUG CANDIDATE FOR

INITIAL APPROVAL. WE TRY TO PLAN CLINICAL TRIALS PRUDENTLY, BUT THERE IS NO

GUARANTEE THAT A PROPER BALANCE OF SPEED AND TESTING WILL BE MADE IN EACH CASE.

THE QUALITY OF OUR DECISIONS IN THIS AREA COULD AFFECT OUR FUTURE RESULTS.

       DIFFICULTIES OR DELAYS IN PRODUCT MANUFACTURING OR MARKETING, INCLUDING, BUT

NOT LIMITED TO, THE INABILITY TO BUILD UP PRODUCTION CAPACITY COMMENSURATE WITH

DEMAND, OR THE FAILURE TO PREDICT MARKET DEMAND FOR, OR TO GAIN MARKET

ACCEPTANCE OF, APPROVED PRODUCTS, COULD AFFECT FUTURE RESULTS.

       WE CURRENTLY MARKET EIGHT PRODUCTS WITH ANNUAL SALES TO THIRD PARTIES

EXCEEDING $1 BILLION EACH.

LIPITOR, NORVASC, ZOLOFT, NEURONTIN, VIAGRA,

ZITHROMAX, DIFLUCAN

AND OUR ALLIANCE PRODUCT

CELEBREX

. THOSE PRODUCTS ACCOUNTED

FOR MORE THAN HALF OF OUR 2001 REVENUES. IF THESE OR ANY OF OUR OTHER MAJOR

PRODUCTS WERE TO BECOME SUBJECT TO A PROBLEM SUCH AS LOSS OF PATENT PROTECTION,

UNEXPECTED SIDE EFFECTS, REGULATORY PROCEEDINGS, PUBLICITY AFFECTING DOCTOR OR

PATIENT CONFIDENCE OR PRESSURE FROM COMPETITIVE PRODUCTS, OR IF A NEW, MORE

EFFECTIVE TREATMENT SHOULD BE INTRODUCED, THE IMPACT ON OUR REVENUES COULD BE

SIGNIFICANT. THE PATENTS COVERING

NEURONTIN, DIFLUCAN

AND

ZOLOFT

ARE THE SUBJECT

OF PENDING LEGAL CHALLENGES, AND AN ACTION ALLEGING PATENT INFRINGEMENT WITH

RESPECT TO THE SALE OF

CELEBREX

ALSO IS PENDING.

       WE CANNOT PREDICT WITH ACCURACY THE TIMING OR IMPACT OF THE INTRODUCTION OF

COMPETITIVE PRODUCTS OR THEIR POSSIBLE FUTURE EFFECT ON OUR SALES. PRODUCTS THAT

POTENTIALLY COULD COMPETE WITH A NUMBER OF OUR DRUGS, INCLUDING SOME OF OUR

BEST-SELLING MEDICINES, ARE IN VARIOUS STAGES OF DEVELOPMENT, AND SOME HAVE BEEN

FILED FOR APPROVAL WITH THE FDA.

       GROWTH IN COSTS AND EXPENSES, CHANGES IN PRODUCT MIX AND THE IMPACT OF

DIVESTITURES, RESTRUCTURING, PRODUCT WITHDRAWALS AND OTHER UNUSUAL ITEMS THAT

COULD RESULT FROM EVOLVING BUSINESS STRATEGIES, EVALUATION OF ASSET REALIZATION

AND ORGANIZATIONAL RESTRUCTURING COULD AFFECT FUTURE RESULTS. FOR EXAMPLE, WE

MAY BE UNABLE TO MAINTAIN OR FURTHER ENHANCE THE MARGIN IMPROVEMENTS ACHIEVED IN

RECENT YEARS.

       ON JANUARY 1, 2002, WE ADOPTED THE PROVISIONS OF STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL

ACCOUNTING STANDARDS (SFAS) NO. 141,

BUSINESS COMBINATIONS

, AND SFAS NO. 142,

GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS

. SFAS NO. 141 ELIMINATES THE POOLING OF

INTERESTS METHOD OF ACCOUNTING FOR BUSINESS COMBINATIONS INITIATED AFTER JUNE

30, 2001. UNDER THE PROVISIONS OF SFAS NO. 142, INTANGIBLE ASSETS WITH

INDEFINITE LIVES AND GOODWILL ARE NO LONGER AMORTIZED BUT ARE SUBJECT TO ANNUAL

IMPAIRMENT TESTS. SEPARABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS WITH FINITE LIVES CONTINUE TO BE

AMORTIZED OVER THEIR USEFUL LIVES. THE ADOPTION OF SFAS NO. 141 DOES NOT IMPACT

OUR FINANCIAL POSITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. APPLICATION OF THE

NON-AMORTIZATION PROVISIONS OF SFAS NO. 142 WILL NOT HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON

OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. THE EFFECT ON DILUTED EARNINGS

PER SHARE IS EXPECTED TO BE LESS THAN ONE CENT PER SHARE FOR 2002. WE HAVE NOT

YET DETERMINED THE

17

TABLE OF CONTENTS

IMPACT, IF ANY, OF ADOPTING THE GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT PROVISIONS OF SFAS NO. 142.

HOWEVER, WE EXPECT TO RECORD A CHARGE IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2002 FOR THE

IMPAIRMENT PROVISIONS AS THEY RELATE TO IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS. THIS

CHARGE IS NOT EXPECTED TO HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION OR

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

IN JUNE 2001, THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD ISSUED SFAS NO.

143,

ACCOUNTING FOR ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS

. SFAS NO. 143 ADDRESSES

FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING REQUIREMENTS FOR RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH

TANGIBLE LONG-LIVED ASSETS. WE DO NOT EXPECT THE PROVISIONS OF SFAS NO. 143 TO

HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. WE WILL ADOPT

THE PROVISIONS OF SFAS NO. 143 AS OF JANUARY 1, 2003.

ON

JANUARY 1, 2002, WE ADOPTED THE PROVISIONS OF SFAS NO. 144,

ACCOUNTING

FOR THE IMPAIRMENT OR DISPOSAL OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS

, THAT REPLACES SFAS NO. 121,

ACCOUNTING FOR THE IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS AND FOR LONG-LIVED ASSETS TO

BE DISPOSED OF

. SFAS NO. 144 REQUIRES THAT LONG-LIVED ASSETS TO BE DISPOSED OF

BY SALE, INCLUDING THOSE OF DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS, BE MEASURED AT THE LOWER OF

CARRYING AMOUNT OR FAIR VALUE LESS COST TO SELL, WHETHER REPORTED IN CONTINUING

OPERATIONS OR IN DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS WILL NO LONGER

BE MEASURED AT NET REALIZABLE VALUE OR INCLUDE AMOUNTS FOR OPERATING LOSSES THAT

HAVE NOT YET BEEN INCURRED. SFAS NO. 144 ALSO BROADENS THE REPORTING OF

DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS TO INCLUDE ALL COMPONENTS OF AN ENTITY WITH OPERATIONS

THAT CAN BE DISTINGUISHED FROM THE REST OF THE ENTITY AND THAT WILL BE

ELIMINATED FROM THE ONGOING OPERATIONS OF THE ENTITY IN A DISPOSAL TRANSACTION.

THE ADOPTION OF SFAS NO. 144 HAS NO IMPACT ON OUR CURRENT OPERATIONS.

ON JANUARY 1, 2002, WE ADOPTED THE PROVISIONS OF THE EMERGING ISSUES TASK

FORCE (EITF) ISSUE NO. 00-25,

VENDOR INCOME STATEMENT CHARACTERIZATION OF

CONSIDERATION PAID TO A RESELLER OF THE VENDORS PRODUCTS

. EITF NO. 00-25

REQUIRES THE COST OF CERTAIN VENDOR CONSIDERATION TO BE CLASSIFIED AS A

REDUCTION OF REVENUE RATHER THAN AS A MARKETING EXPENSE. OUR ADOPTION OF EITF

NO. 00-25 WILL RESULT IN RECLASSIFICATIONS OF CERTAIN MARKETING EXPENSES TO

REFLECT THEM AS A REDUCTION OF REVENUES. THESE RECLASSIFICATIONS WILL HAVE NO

EFFECT ON NET INCOME

FROM TIME TO TIME, NEW OR REVISED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS AND RULES ARE

ISSUED. ALTHOUGH THE STANDARDS MENTIONED ABOVE ARE NOT EXPECTED TO HAVE A

MATERIAL EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (OR, AS

NOTED, IN ONE INSTANCE WE HAVE NOT YET DETERMINED THE IMPACT), FUTURE STANDARDS

AND RULES COULD HAVE SUCH AN EFFECT.

       CHANGES IN THE U.S. TAX CODE AND THE TAX LAWS OF OTHER COUNTRIES, AS WELL AS

OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR THE FISCAL YEAR, CAN AFFECT OUR NET EARNINGS. DURING

2001, NO MAJOR U.S. OR INTERNATIONAL TAX LEGISLATION WAS ENACTED THAT WOULD

MATERIALLY IMPACT OUR NET EARNINGS. IT IS NOT POSSIBLE, HOWEVER, TO PREDICT THE

IMPACT ON OUR FUTURE RESULTS OF ANY TAX LEGISLATION ENACTED IN THE FUTURE.

       OUR FUTURE RESULTS COULD BE AFFECTED BY CHANGES IN BUSINESS, POLITICAL AND

ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, INCLUDING THE COST AND AVAILABILITY OF INSURANCE, DUE TO

THE SEPTEMBER 11, 2001 TERRORIST ATTACKS IN THE U.S., THE THREAT OF FUTURE

TERRORIST ACTIVITY IN THE U.S. AND OTHER PARTS OF THE WORLD AND RELATED U.S.

MILITARY ACTION OVERSEAS.

       WE ARE INVOLVED IN VARIOUS PATENT, PRODUCT LIABILITY, CONSUMER, ENVIRONMENTAL

AND TAX CLAIMS AND LITIGATIONS AND ADDITIONAL MATTERS THAT ARISE FROM TIME TO

TIME IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF OUR BUSINESS. THESE INCLUDE CHALLENGES TO THE

COVERAGE AND/OR VALIDITY OF PATENTS ON PRODUCTS OR PROCESSES AND ALLEGATIONS OF

INJURIES CAUSED BY DRUGS OR MEDICAL DEVICES. IN ADDITION, WE ARE SUBJECT TO

NATIONAL, STATE AND LOCAL ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS. WE ARE ALSO

INVOLVED IN OR ARE THE SUBJECT OF GOVERNMENTAL OR REGULATORY AGENCY INQUIRIES OR

INVESTIGATIONS FROM TIME TO TIME. LITIGATION IS INHERENTLY UNPREDICTABLE, AND

EXCESSIVE VERDICTS THAT ARE NOT JUSTIFIED BY THE EVIDENCE CAN OCCUR. WE BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE VALID DEFENSES WITH RESPECT TO THE LEGAL MATTERS PENDING

AGAINST US AND, TAKING INTO ACCOUNT OUR INSURANCE AND RESERVES, WE BELIEVE THAT

THE ULTIMATE RESOLUTION OF THESE MATTERS WILL NOT HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT

ON OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR CASH FLOWS. IT IS POSSIBLE,

HOWEVER, THAT CASH FLOWS OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COULD BE AFFECTED IN ANY

PARTICULAR PERIOD BY THE RESOLUTION OF ONE OR MORE OF THESE CONTINGENCIES.

ARE SUBJECT TO NATIONAL, STATE AND LOCAL ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS. WE

ARE ALSO INVOLVED IN OR ARE THE SUBJECT OF GOVERNMENTAL OR REGULATORY AGENCY

INQUIRIES OR INVESTIGATIONS FROM TIME TO TIME. LITIGATION IS INHERENTLY

UNPREDICTABLE, AND EXCESSIVE VERDICTS THAT ARE NOT JUSTIFIED BY THE EVIDENCE CAN

ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR CASH FLOWS.

IT IS POSSIBLE, HOWEVER, THAT CASH FLOWS OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COULD BE

AFFECTED IN ANY PARTICULAR PERIOD BY THE RESOLUTION OF ONE OR MORE OF THESE

CONTINGENCIES. AMONG THE PRINCIPAL MATTERS PENDING AGAINST US ARE THE FOLLOWING.

PATENT LITIGATION

GENERIC DRUG MANUFACTURERS

GENERIC COMPETITION IS A MAJOR CHALLENGE IN THE U.S. AND IS GROWING

INTERNATIONALLY. WE ARE INVOLVED IN A NUMBER OF PATENT SUITS, THE MAJORITY OF

WHICH INVOLVE CLAIMS BY GENERIC DRUG MANUFACTURERS THAT PATENTS COVERING OUR

PRODUCTS, PROCESSES OR DOSAGE FORMS ARE INVALID AND/OR DO NOT COVER THE PRODUCT

OF THE GENERIC MANUFACTURER. IN SOME OF THESE SUITS, THE CHALLENGERS ALSO CLAIM

THAT OUR ASSERTIONS OF OR ATTEMPTS TO ENFORCE RIGHTS UNDER OUR PATENTS

21

TABLE OF CONTENTS

CONSTITUTE UNFAIR COMPETITION AND/OR VIOLATIONS OF THE ANTITRUST LAWS.

PENDING SUITS INCLUDE CHALLENGES TO PATENTS COVERING, AMONG OTHER

PRODUCTS, SERTRALINE

(ZOLOFT)

, GABAPENTIN

(NEURONTIN)

,

FLUCONAZOLE

(DIFLUCAN)

,

QUINAPRIL

(ACCUPRIL)

, GLIPIZIDE

(GLUCOTROL XL)

,

NIFEDIPINE

(PROCARDIA XL)

,

ESTROSTEP FE

(ORAL CONTRACEPTIVE) AND

FEMHRT 1/5

(HORMONE REPLACEMENT THERAPY).

A LOSS IN ANY OF THESE CASES COULD RESULT IN A LOSS OF PATENT PROTECTION FOR THE

DRUG AT ISSUE, COULD LEAD TO SIGNIFICANT LOSS OF SALES OF THAT DRUG IN THE U.S.

MARKET AND COULD AFFECT FUTURE RESULTS.

DIFLUCAN

THE PATENT SUIT RELATING TO

DIFLUCAN

IS PENDING IN THE U.S. DISTRICT COURT

FOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF ILLINOIS. TRIAL IS EXPECTED IN THE LATTER PART OF 2002

OR EARLY 2003.

NEURONTIN

WITH RESPECT TO

NEURONTIN

, SUITS AGAINST FIVE GENERIC DRUG MANUFACTURERS

ARE PENDING IN THE U.S. DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF NEW JERSEY. MOTIONS

FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT OF NON-INFRINGEMENT OF THE PATENT ON OUR STABLE, LOW -

LACTAM PHARMACEUTICAL COMPOSITION HAVE BEEN FILED BY TWO GENERIC MANUFACTURERS

AND AWAIT DECISION. ANY FURTHER MOTIONS ARE DUE TO BE FILED BY LATE JUNE. IN THE

EVENT THAT SUMMARY JUDGMENT IS DENIED, TRIALS OF THESE CASES ARE EXPECTED IN THE

LATTER PART OF 2002 OR EARLY 2003.

IN THESE

NEURONTIN

CASES, THE GENERIC MANUFACTURERS HAVE FILED

COUNTERCLAIMS AGAINST US CLAIMING THAT OUR ASSERTIONS OF OR ATTEMPTS TO ENFORCE

RIGHTS UNDER OUR PATENTS CONSTITUTE UNFAIR COMPETITION AND/OR VIOLATIONS OF

FEDERAL AND STATE ANTITRUST LAWS. IN OCTOBER 2001, THE FTC REQUESTED CERTAIN

INFORMATION CONCERNING OUR GABAPENTIN

(NEURONTIN)

PATENTS AND THEIR ENFORCEMENT,

AND WE ARE COOPERATING WITH THAT REQUEST. IN MARCH 2002, A NUMBER OF SUITS WERE

FILED IN THE U.S. DISTRICT COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK, ONE BY A

HEALTH PLAN ON BEHALF OF ITS MEMBERS AND THE OTHERS BY INDIVIDUALS, EACH OF

WHICH SEEKS CLASS ACTION STATUS AND EACH OF WHICH ALLEGES THAT PFIZERS SUITS TO

ENFORCE OUR GABAPENTIN PATENTS AGAINST GENERIC MANUFACTURERS CONSTITUTE A

VIOLATION OF THE ANTITRUST LAWS.

PROCARDIA XL

A

SUIT INVOLVING THE PATENT ON NIFEDIPINE

(PROCARDIA XL)

AGAINST A GENERIC

MANUFACTURER, MYLAN PHARMACEUTICALS, WAS SETTLED IN 2000. THAT SETTLEMENT HAS

BEEN CHALLENGED IN SEVERAL COURTS UNDER THE ANTITRUST LAWS BY ANOTHER GENERIC

MANUFACTURER, BIOVAIL LABORATORIES, AND BY FIVE HEALTH PLANS, THE LATTER SEEKING

CLASS ACTION STATUS ON BEHALF OF THEIR MEMBERS.

CELEBREX

IN 2000, THE UNIVERSITY OF ROCHESTER FILED A PATENT INFRINGEMENT ACTION

AGAINST PFIZER; G.D. SEARLE & CO., INC.; MONSANTO CO.; AND

PHARMACIA CORPORATION, IN

THE U. S. DISTRICT COURT FOR THE WESTERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK, ALLEGING THAT

SALES OF

CELEBREX

INFRINGE THE BROAD METHOD OF USE CLAIMS OF THE UNIVERSITYS

PATENT. THE CASE IS IN THE PRETRIAL DISCOVERY STAGE.

PRODUCTS LIABILITY MATTERS

REZULIN

THE

REZULIN

LITIGATION ARISES FROM A DIABETES DRUG DEVELOPED BY SANKYO IN

JAPAN AND BY WARNER-LAMBERT.

REZULIN

WAS REPORTED TO BE PRESCRIBED TO

APPROXIMATELY TWO MILLION PATIENTS. THE MEDICATION TREATED INSULIN RESISTANCE,

WHICH IS THE CAUSE OF TYPE 2 DIABETES, AND WAS EFFECTIVE FOR MANY PATIENTS WHOSE

DIABETES HAD NOT BEEN CONTROLLED WITH OTHER MEDICATIONS. WE BELIEVE THAT THE

FDA-APPROVED LABELING AND WARNINGS APPROPRIATELY COMMUNICATED THE RISKS

ASSOCIATED WITH THE MEDICATION, INCLUDING THE RISK OF LIVER INJURY, WHICH

OCCURRED IN A SMALL PERCENTAGE OF CASES.

22

TABLE OF CONTENTS

REZULIN

WAS VOLUNTARILY WITHDRAWN IN MARCH 2000 FOLLOWING APPROVAL OF TWO

NEWER DIABETES MEDICATIONS, WHICH THE FDA CONSIDERED TO HAVE SIMILAR EFFICACY

AND FEWER SIDE EFFECTS.

CURRENTLY, MORE THAN 2,000 SUITS INVOLVING

REZULIN

HAVE BEEN FILED IN

FEDERAL AND STATE COURTS INVOLVING APPROXIMATELY 5,100

REZULIN

USERS.

SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THESE SUITS ARE AT A PRELIMINARY STAGE AND, CONSEQUENTLY,

WE ARE UNABLE TO FULLY EVALUATE THE CLAIMS. A NUMBER OF CASES HAVE BEEN SETTLED,

AND A SMALL NUMBER HAVE BEEN TRIED TO VERDICT. THE CASES PENDING IN FEDERAL

COURTS HAVE ALL BEEN CONSOLIDATED FOR PRETRIAL PROCEEDINGS IN A SINGLE

MULTI-DISTRICT LITIGATION ASSIGNED TO THE U.S. DISTRICT COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN

DISTRICT OF NEW YORK. IN ADDITION, APPROXIMATELY 375

REZULIN

USERS HAVE

SUBMITTED CLAIMS TO THE COMPANY (BUT HAVE NOT FILED SUITS). THE COMPANY HAS

EXTENDED THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS FOR APPROXIMATELY ANOTHER 18,000 PERSONS WHO

DO NOT HAVE LAWSUITS ON FILE AND MAY OR MAY NOT EVENTUALLY FILE SUITS.

WE ARE OPPOSING CLASS CERTIFICATION IN ALL CASES. CLASS CERTIFICATION HAS

BEEN DENIED BY STATE COURTS IN CALIFORNIA AND WEST VIRGINIA, THE FIRST TWO

DECISIONS ON THE ISSUE. IN ANOTHER CASE INVOLVING CLASS CLAIMS, THE U.S.

DISTRICT COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK DISMISSED A COMPLAINT BY

BLUE CROSS/BLUE SHIELD OF LOUISIANA AND OTHER HEALTH-BENEFIT PLANS TO RECOVER

MONEY PAID FOR

REZULIN

AND LIVER TESTING. OTHER REQUESTS FOR CLASS CERTIFICATION

ARE PENDING IN VARIOUS COURTS.

WE ARE ACTIVELY ENGAGED IN DEFENDING THE LITIGATIONS, AND, WHERE

APPROPRIATE, RESOLVING THE LITIGATIONS AND CLAIMS. AS IN MOST MULTIPLE TORT

LITIGATION, THE CASES PRESENT A WIDE VARIETY OF CLAIMS, RANGING FROM ALLEGATIONS

OF SERIOUS INJURY CAUSED BY

REZULIN

TO EFFORTS TO OBTAIN COMPENSATION

NOTWITHSTANDING THE ABSENCE OF ANY INJURY AT ALL. BASED ON THE INFORMATION

AVAILABLE TO US, ONLY A VERY SMALL PERCENTAGE OF THE CLAIMANTS CAN DEMONSTRATE

ANY REAL INJURY CAUSED BY THE MEDICATION. FOR EXAMPLE, AT THE TIME THE DRUG WAS

WITHDRAWN, THERE WERE 90 CASES OF LIVER FAILURE REPORTED TO THE FDA THAT WERE

POSSIBLY OR PROBABLY ATTRIBUTABLE TO

REZULIN

. NOR IS THERE ANY VALID SCIENTIFIC

BASIS FOR CONCLUDING THAT

REZULIN

HAD ANY ADVERSE LATENT EFFECT.

WHILE WE ARE PREPARED TO PAY REASONABLE COMPENSATION TO THE RELATIVELY

SMALL NUMBER OF CLAIMANTS WITH INJURIES DEMONSTRABLY CAUSED BY

REZULIN

, WE

INTEND TO DEFEND VIGOROUSLY THE VAST MAJORITY OF CASES IN WHICH THE PLAINTIFFS

INJURIES, IF ANY, CANNOT REASONABLY BE ATTRIBUTED TO THE MEDICATION.

A FEDERAL GRAND JURY IN MARYLAND HAS SOUGHT DOCUMENTS RELATING TO

REZULIN

FROM US AND TESTIMONY FROM FORMER WARNER-LAMBERT EMPLOYEES. WE ARE COOPERATING

WITH THIS INVESTIGATION.

ASBESTOS

IN THE 1960S, PFIZER ACQUIRED TWO BUSINESSES, THE GIBSONBURG LIME PRODUCTS

COMPANY (GLPC) AND QUIGLEY COMPANY, INC., THAT HAD LIMITED SALES OF MINOR

PRODUCTS THAT CONTAINED SMALL AMOUNTS OF CHRYSOTILE ASBESTOS AND THAT NOW FORM

THE BASIS FOR THE COMPANYS ASBESTOS LITIGATION. BETWEEN 1967 AND 1982,

WARNER-LAMBERT OWNED AMERICAN OPTICAL CORPORATION, WHICH MANUFACTURED AND SOLD

RESPIRATORY PROTECTIVE DEVICES AND ASBESTOS SAFETY CLOTHING.

APPROXIMATELY 169,000 CLAIMS NAMING PFIZER AND/OR QUIGLEY, AND NUMEROUS

OTHER DEFENDANTS, ARE CURRENTLY PENDING IN STATE AND FEDERAL COURTS SEEKING

DAMAGES FOR ALLEGED ASBESTOS EXPOSURE. BECAUSE MANY CLAIMANTS NAME BOTH PFIZER

AND QUIGLEY, DESPITE THE FACT THAT THEIR WORK HISTORIES MAKE EXPOSURE TO BOTH

GLPC AND QUIGLEY PRODUCTS HIGHLY UNLIKELY, THE NUMBER OF CLAIMS OVERSTATES THE

NUMBER OF CLAIMANTS, WHICH WE ESTIMATE TO BE APPROXIMATELY 118,000. IN ADDITION,

APPROXIMATELY 63,000 CLAIMANTS HAVE NAMED AMERICAN OPTICAL AS A DEFENDANT. BASED

UPON AVAILABLE DATA AND OUR EXPERIENCE IN HANDLING ASBESTOS CLAIMS, WE BELIEVE

THAT THE VAST MAJORITY OF PLAINTIFFS DO NOT HAVE ANY IMPAIRING MEDICAL

CONDITION. FOR THOSE CLAIMANTS WHO DO, WE BELIEVE WE HAVE MERITORIOUS DEFENSES

AND ARE DEFENDING THESE CASES VIGOROUSLY.

23

TABLE OF CONTENTS

SINCE THE INCEPTION OF THIS LITIGATION, PFIZER AND QUIGLEY HAVE CLOSED,

THROUGH SETTLEMENT FOR VARYING AMOUNTS OR THROUGH LITIGATION, IN EXCESS OF

185,000 ASBESTOS SUITS OR CLAIMS. IN THE SAME PERIOD, AMERICAN OPTICAL HAS

CLOSED IN EXCESS OF 40,000 SUCH SUITS OR CLAIMS.

OTHER PRODUCTS LIABILITY MATTERS

WE ARE ALSO DEFENDING CLAIMS AND LAWSUITS INVOLVING A NUMBER OF OTHER

PRODUCTS, IN WHICH THE RELIEF SOUGHT INCLUDES MONEY DAMAGES ON BEHALF OF

INDIVIDUALS OR CLAIMS BY PURPORTED CLASSES OF USERS OF THE PRODUCTS, WHO SEEK

MONEY DAMAGES, INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND/OR MEDICAL MONITORING.

ANTITRUST MATTERS

IN 1993, BOTH PFIZER AND WARNER-LAMBERT WERE NAMED, TOGETHER WITH NUMEROUS

OTHER MANUFACTURERS OF BRAND-NAME PRESCRIPTION DRUGS AND CERTAIN COMPANIES THAT

DISTRIBUTE BRAND-NAME PRESCRIPTION DRUGS, IN SUITS IN FEDERAL AND STATE COURTS

BROUGHT BY VARIOUS GROUPS OF RETAIL PHARMACY COMPANIES, ALLEGING THAT THE

MANUFACTURERS VIOLATED THE SHERMAN ACT BY AGREEING NOT TO GIVE RETAILERS CERTAIN

DISCOUNTS AND THAT THE FAILURE TO GIVE SUCH DISCOUNTS VIOLATED THE

ROBINSON - PATMAN ACT. A CLASS ACTION WAS BROUGHT ON THE SHERMAN ACT CLAIM, AS WELL AS

ADDITIONAL ACTIONS BY NUMEROUS INDIVIDUAL RETAIL PHARMACIES AND A GROUP OF CHAIN

AND SUPERMARKET PHARMACIES ON BOTH THE SHERMAN ACT AND ROBINSON - PATMAN ACT

CLAIMS. THAT LITIGATION HAS BEEN LARGELY RESOLVED, AT BOTH THE FEDERAL AND STATE

LEVELS, WITH THE PRINCIPAL EXCEPTION OF A GROUP OF APPROXIMATELY 3,800 OPT-OUT

CLAIMANTS FROM THE ORIGINAL FEDERAL CLASS ACTION WHO ARE CONTINUING TO PURSUE

THEIR CLAIMS INDIVIDUALLY IN FEDERAL COURT IN NEW YORK.

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

OUR OPERATIONS ARE SUBJECT TO FEDERAL, STATE, LOCAL AND FOREIGN

ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS. UNDER THE COMPREHENSIVE ENVIRONMENTAL

RESPONSE COMPENSATION AND LIABILITY ACT OF 1980, AS AMENDED (CERCLA OR

SUPERFUND), WE HAVE BEEN DESIGNATED AS A POTENTIALLY RESPONSIBLE PARTY BY THE

UNITED STATES ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY WITH RESPECT TO CERTAIN WASTE

SITES WITH WHICH WE MAY HAVE HAD DIRECT OR INDIRECT INVOLVEMENT. SIMILAR

DESIGNATIONS HAVE BEEN MADE BY SOME STATE ENVIRONMENTAL AGENCIES UNDER

APPLICABLE STATE SUPERFUND LAWS. SUCH DESIGNATIONS ARE MADE REGARDLESS OF THE

EXTENT OF OUR INVOLVEMENT. WE OWN OR PREVIOUSLY OWNED SEVERAL SITES FOR WHICH WE

MAY BE THE SOLE RESPONSIBLE PARTY. THERE ARE ALSO CLAIMS THAT WE MAY BE A

RESPONSIBLE PARTY OR PARTICIPANT WITH RESPECT TO SEVERAL WASTE SITE MATTERS IN

FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS. SUCH CLAIMS HAVE BEEN MADE BY THE FILING OF A COMPLAINT,

THE ISSUANCE OF AN ADMINISTRATIVE DIRECTIVE OR ORDER, OR THE ISSUANCE OF A

NOTICE OR DEMAND LETTER. THESE CLAIMS ARE IN VARIOUS STAGES OF ADMINISTRATIVE OR

JUDICIAL PROCEEDINGS. THEY INCLUDE DEMANDS FOR RECOVERY OF PAST GOVERNMENTAL

COSTS AND FOR FUTURE INVESTIGATIVE OR REMEDIAL ACTIONS. IN MANY CASES, THE

DOLLAR AMOUNT OF THE CLAIM IS NOT SPECIFIED. IN MOST CASES, CLAIMS HAVE BEEN

ASSERTED AGAINST A NUMBER OF OTHER ENTITIES FOR THE SAME RECOVERY OR OTHER

RELIEF AS WAS ASSERTED AGAINST US. WE ARE CURRENTLY PARTICIPATING IN REMEDIAL

ACTION AT A NUMBER OF SITES UNDER FEDERAL, STATE, LOCAL AND FOREIGN LAWS.

TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE WITH THE LIMITED AMOUNT OF INFORMATION AVAILABLE AT

THIS TIME, WE HAVE EVALUATED OUR RESPONSIBILITY FOR COSTS AND RELATED LIABILITY

WITH RESPECT TO THE ABOVE SITES AND ARE OF THE OPINION THAT OUR LIABILITY WITH

RESPECT TO THESE SITES SHOULD NOT HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR

FINANCIAL POSITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR CASH FLOWS. IN ARRIVING AT THIS

CONCLUSION, WE HAVE CONSIDERED, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE PAYMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN

MADE WITH RESPECT TO THE SITES IN THE PAST; THE FACTORS, SUCH AS VOLUME AND

RELATIVE TOXICITY, ORDINARILY APPLIED TO ALLOCATE DEFENSE AND REMEDIAL COSTS AT

24

TABLE OF CONTENTS

SUCH SITES; THE PROBABLE COSTS TO BE PAID BY THE OTHER POTENTIALLY RESPONSIBLE

PARTIES; TOTAL PROJECTED REMEDIAL COSTS FOR A SITE, IF KNOWN; EXISTING

TECHNOLOGY; AND THE CURRENTLY ENACTED LAWS AND REGULATIONS. WE ANTICIPATE THAT A

PORTION OF THESE COSTS AND RELATED LIABILITY WILL BE COVERED BY AVAILABLE

INSURANCE.

THROUGH OUR OWN INTERNAL AUDIT PROCEDURES, DURING 2001 WE BECAME AWARE OF

CERTAIN PRACTICES RELATED TO THE SAMPLING OF WASTE WATER AT OUR PARSIPPANY,

N.J., MANUFACTURING FACILITY WHICH MAY NOT COMPLY WITH REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS

ENACTED OR ADOPTED FOR THE PURPOSE OF PROTECTING THE ENVIRONMENT. WE VOLUNTARILY

DISCLOSED OUR INITIAL DETECTION OF POTENTIAL NON-COMPLIANCE TO THE NEW JERSEY

DEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION (NJDEP) AND TO THE U.S. ENVIRONMENTAL

PROTECTION AGENCY (USEPA). SINCE THEN, WE VOLUNTARILY DISCLOSED INFORMATION

ACQUIRED SINCE THE INITIAL DISCLOSURE TO THE NJDEP. FURTHER DISCLOSURE TO THE

USEPA MAY BE REQUIRED IN THE FUTURE. WHILE NO FORMAL ENFORCEMENT PROCEEDING HAS

BEEN INITIATED, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT SUCH A PROCEEDING MAY BE COMMENCED IN THE

FUTURE AND THAT CIVIL PENALTIES MAY BE SOUGHT.

OTHER MATTERS

NEURONTIN

THE U.S. ATTORNEYS OFFICE IN BOSTON, MASSACHUSETTS, IS CONDUCTING AN

INVESTIGATION INTO WARNER-LAMBERTS PROMOTION OF

NEURONTIN

; AND IN 2000 AND

2001, CERTAIN FORMER EMPLOYEES OF WARNER-LAMBERT WERE SUBPOENAED TO PROVIDE

TESTIMONY BEFORE A FEDERAL GRAND JURY. IT IS POSSIBLE THAT CRIMINAL CHARGES AND

FINES COULD BE SOUGHT AS A RESULT OF THIS INVESTIGATION. WE CONTINUE TO

COOPERATE WITH THIS INQUIRY.

IN ADDITION, A FORMER EMPLOYEE OF WARNER-LAMBERT HAS COMMENCED A CIVIL

LAWSUIT IN FEDERAL COURT IN MASSACHUSETTS AGAINST WARNER-LAMBERT, ON BEHALF OF

THE UNITED STATES, UNDER 31 U.S.C. 3730. THE LAWSUIT ALLEGES THAT WARNER-LAMBERT

VIOLATED THE FEDERAL FALSE CLAIMS ACT BASED ON CERTAIN ALLEGED SALES AND

MARKETING PRACTICES CONCERNING

NEURONTIN.

LIPITOR

THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE HAS COMMENCED A CIVIL INVESTIGATION INTO

WARNER-LAMBERTS PRICING FOR

LIPITOR

DURING 1999 AND 2000, AIMED AT DETERMINING

WHETHER GRANTS MADE TO CERTAIN HEALTH PLANS AND PBMS SHOULD BE CHARACTERIZED AS

REBATES, WHICH WOULD ENTITLE THE GOVERNMENT TO A FURTHER DISCOUNT UNDER THE

MEDICAID BEST-PRICE RULES. WE ARE COOPERATING WITH THIS INVESTIGATION.

ZITHROMAX

A CONSORTIUM OF STATE ATTORNEYS GENERAL HAS REQUESTED AND HAS BEEN

EVALUATING INFORMATION ABOUT OUR PROMOTION OF

ZITHROMAX

FOR USE IN TREATING

PEDIATRIC OTITIS MEDIA (EAR INFECTIONS). WE ARE COOPERATING WITH THIS

INVESTIGATION.

ZYRTEC PRESCRIPTION-OTC SWITCH

A PETITION WAS FILED WITH THE FDA BY BLUE CROSS OF CALIFORNIA, A

SUBSIDIARY OF WELLPOINT HEALTH NETWORKS, IN JULY 1998 REQUESTING THAT SECOND

GENERATION ANTIHISTAMINES AND ANTIHISTAMINE-DECONGESTANT COMBINATION DRUGS BE

SWITCHED FROM PRESCRIPTION TO OTC STATUS. THE PETITION SPECIFICALLY TARGETED

ZYRTEC

AS WELL AS TWO OTHER PRESCRIPTION DRUGS. THE FDA HELD A PUBLIC HEARING ON

THE MATTER IN 2001. THE COMPANY FILED COMMENTS QUESTIONING THE AUTHORITY OF THE

FDA TO TAKE THE REQUESTED ACTION WITHOUT AFFORDING THE SPONSOR OF THE NDA DRUGS

IN QUESTION AN EVIDENTIARY HEARING. THE FDA HAS NOT YET TAKEN ACTION IN THE

MATTER.

SECURITIES LITIGATION

ON JULY 20, 2001, OUR SUBSIDIARY, AGOURON PHARMACEUTICALS, INC., WAS

SERVED WITH THE FIRST OF THREE RELATED PURPORTED CLASS ACTIONS BROUGHT BY

SHAREHOLDERS OF IMMUNE RESPONSE CORP. (IRC) IN THE U. S. DISTRICT COURT FOR THE

SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA UNDER SECTIONS 10(B) AND 20(A) OF THE SECURITIES

EXCHANGE ACT

25

TABLE OF CONTENTS

OF 1934. THE COMPLAINTS ALLEGE THAT IRC AND ITS CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND

AGOURON AND ITS FORMER CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER MISLED THE INVESTING PUBLIC ABOUT

THE STATUS OF AND PROSPECTS FOR

REMUNE

, AN AIDS TREATMENT IN DEVELOPMENT, THAT

HAD BEEN LICENSED BY IRC TO AGOURON IN JUNE 1998. ON JULY 16, 2001, AGOURON HAD

ANNOUNCED THAT, IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE TERMS OF THE IRC AGREEMENT, IT HAD

DETERMINED NOT TO PURSUE THE DEVELOPMENT OF

REMUNE

. THE CASES ARE IN THE EARLY

PROCEDURAL STAGES.

MERGER LITIGATION

WARNER-LAMBERT AND ITS DIRECTORS ARE NAMED AS DEFENDANTS IN PURPORTED

CLASS ACTIONS CURRENTLY PENDING IN DELAWARE CHANCERY COURT AND IN FEDERAL COURT

IN NEW JERSEY, BROUGHT BY THE FORMER SHAREHOLDERS OF WARNER-LAMBERT. THESE

LAWSUITS ALLEGE THAT WARNER-LAMBERTS DIRECTORS BREACHED THEIR FIDUCIARY DUTIES

TO WARNER-LAMBERT AND/OR ITS SHAREHOLDERS IN CONNECTION WITH A MERGER AGREEMENT

ENTERED INTO BETWEEN WARNER-LAMBERT AND AMERICAN HOME PRODUCTS CORP., WHICH

AGREEMENT WAS ULTIMATELY TERMINATED IN CONNECTION WITH THE PFIZER-WARNER-LAMBERT

MERGER. THE DEFENDANTS HAVE MOVED TO DISMISS THE ACTIONS.
