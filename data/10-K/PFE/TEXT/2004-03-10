CONSUMER HEALTHCARE CAN EXTEND THE LIFE OF SOME OF OUR PRESCRIPTION

MEDICATIONS BY CONVERTING THEM TO OTC MEDICATIONS. FOR EXAMPLE,

NICORETTE,

BENADRYL, SUDAFED

AND

ZANTAC 75

WERE ALL PREVIOUSLY PRESCRIPTION PRODUCTS. AS

MARKET CONDITIONS PERMIT, AND WHEN WE HAVE NECESSARY APPROVAL FROM DRUG

REGULATORY AUTHORITIES, WE PLAN TO PURSUE SIMILAR LAUNCHES FOR OTHER PRODUCTS.

ANIMAL HEALTH SEGMENT

OUR ANIMAL HEALTH BUSINESS IS THE LARGEST IN THE WORLD. WE DISCOVER,

DEVELOP AND SELL PRODUCTS FOR THE PREVENTION AND TREATMENT OF DISEASES IN

LIVESTOCK AND COMPANION ANIMALS. IN 2003, ANIMAL HEALTH REVENUES INCREASED 43%,

TO $1.6 BILLION, MAINLY DUE TO THE INCLUSION OF LEGACY PHARMACIA PRODUCTS AS

WELL AS STRONG PERFORMANCES BY MANY LEGACY PFIZER PRODUCTS AND THE FAVORABLE

IMPACT OF FOREIGN EXCHANGE. REVENUES FROM THIS SEGMENT CONTRIBUTED 3.5% OF OUR

TOTAL REVENUES IN EACH OF 2003, 2002 AND 2001.

AMONG THE PRODUCTS WE MARKET ARE PARASITICIDES, ANTI-INFLAMMATORIES,

VACCINES, ANTIBIOTICS AND RELATED MEDICINES, INCLUDING THE PRODUCTS DISCUSSED

BELOW.

PARASITICIDES CONSTITUTE THE LARGEST SEGMENT OF THE ANIMAL HEALTH MARKET

FOR COMPANION ANIMALS, CONSISTING MAINLY OF MEDICINES FOR THE CONTROL OF

PARASITES SUCH AS FLEAS AND HEARTWORM. OUR PRODUCT,

REVOLUTION

, IS OUR

LARGEST-SELLING PARASITICIDE FOR COMPANION ANIMALS.

RIMADYL

RELIEVES PAIN AND INFLAMMATION ASSOCIATED WITH CANINE

OSTEOARTHRITIS AND SOFT TISSUE ORTHOPEDIC SURGERY.

RIMADYL

IS THE ONLY

ARTHRITIS PAIN MEDICATION PRESCRIBED BY VETERINARIANS AVAILABLE IN CHEWABLE

TABLETS AND REGULAR CAPLETS AND IN AN INJECTABLE FORMULATION.

CLAVAMOX/SYNULOX

AND EXTERNAL PARASITES IN BEEF CATTLE.

NAXCEL/EXCENEL RTU

IS AN ANTIBIOTIC USED TO TREAT RESPIRATORY AND INTERNAL

INFECTIONS IN CATTLE AND SWINE.

ON DECEMBER 15, 2003, WE ANNOUNCED THAT ANIMAL HEALTH HAS AGREED TO

ACQUIRE CSL ANIMAL HEALTH, A DIVISION OF CSL LIMITED OF MELBOURNE, AUSTRALIA,

FOR $126 MILLION. THIS ACQUISITION, WHICH IS SUBJECT TO REGULATORY APPROVALS

AND IS EXPECTED TO CLOSE IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2004, WILL ENHANCE OUR

PRESENCE IN AUSTRALIAS ANIMAL HEALTH MARKETPLACE.

RESEARCH AND PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT

INNOVATION BY OUR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT OPERATIONS IS VERY IMPORTANT TO

THE COMPANYS SUCCESS. OUR GOAL IS TO DISCOVER, DEVELOP AND BRING TO MARKET

INNOVATIVE PRODUCTS THAT ADDRESS MAJOR UNMET MEDICAL NEEDS. THIS GOAL HAS BEEN

SUPPORTED BY OUR SUBSTANTIAL RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT INVESTMENTS. WE SPENT

$7.1 BILLION IN 2003, $5.2 BILLION IN 2002 AND $4.8 BILLION IN 2001 ON RESEARCH

AND DEVELOPMENT.

WE CONDUCT RESEARCH INTERNALLY AND ALSO THROUGH CONTRACTS WITH THIRD

PARTIES, THROUGH COLLABORATIONS WITH UNIVERSITIES AND BIOTECHNOLOGY COMPANIES

AND IN COOPERATION WITH OTHER PHARMACEUTICAL FIRMS. WE ALSO SEEK OUT INNOVATIVE

TECHNOLOGIES DEVELOPED BY THIRD PARTIES TO INCORPORATE INTO OUR DISCOVERY OR

DEVELOPMENT PROCESSES OR PROJECTS AS WELL AS OUR PRODUCT LINES THROUGH

ACQUISITION OR THROUGH LICENSING OR OTHER ARRANGEMENTS.

DRUG DISCOVERY AND DEVELOPMENT IS TIME CONSUMING, EXPENSIVE AND

UNPREDICTABLE. ON AVERAGE, ONLY ONE OUT OF MANY THOUSANDS OF CHEMICAL COMPOUNDS

DISCOVERED BY RESEARCHERS PROVES TO BE BOTH MEDICALLY EFFECTIVE AND SAFE ENOUGH

TO BECOME AN APPROVED MEDICINE. THE PROCESS FROM EARLY DISCOVERY TO DEVELOPMENT

TO REGULATORY APPROVAL CAN TAKE MORE THAN TEN YEARS. DRUG CANDIDATES CAN FAIL

AT ANY STAGE OF THE PROCESS. CANDIDATES MAY NOT RECEIVE REGULATORY APPROVAL

EVEN AFTER MANY YEARS OF RESEARCH.

WE BELIEVE THAT OUR INVESTMENTS IN RESEARCH HAVE BEEN REWARDED BY THE

NUMBER OF PHARMACEUTICAL COMPOUNDS WE HAVE IN ALL STAGES OF DEVELOPMENT. WE

CURRENTLY ARE WORKING ON APPROXIMATELY 225 PROJECTS IN DEVELOPMENT, INCLUDING

APPROXIMATELY 130 NEW MOLECULAR ENTITIES AND 95 PRODUCT-LINE EXTENSIONS. IN

ADDITION, WE HAVE MORE THAN 400 PROJECTS IN DISCOVERY RESEARCH. IN RECENT

YEARS, OUR DISCOVERY SCIENTISTS HAVE DELIVERED DOZENS OF NEW CHEMICAL COMPOUNDS

TO EARLY DEVELOPMENT. WHILE THESE NEW CANDIDATES MAY OR MAY NOT EVENTUALLY

RECEIVE REGULATORY APPROVAL, NEW DRUG CANDIDATES ENTERING DEVELOPMENT ARE THE

FOUNDATION FOR FUTURE PRODUCTS.

IN ADDITION TO DISCOVERING AND DEVELOPING NEW PRODUCTS, OUR RESEARCH

OPERATIONS ADD VALUE TO OUR EXISTING PRODUCTS BY IMPROVING THEIR EFFECTIVENESS

AND BY DISCOVERING NEW USES FOR THEM. IN 2003, FOR EXAMPLE, THE FDA APPROVED

THE ADDITIONAL USE OF

ZOLOFT

FOR THE TREATMENT OF SOCIAL ANXIETY DISORDER.

INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS

WE HAVE SIGNIFICANT OPERATIONS OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES. THEY ARE

CONDUCTED BOTH THROUGH OUR SUBSIDIARIES AND THROUGH DISTRIBUTORS, AND INVOLVE

THE SAME BUSINESS SEGMENTS - PHARMACEUTICAL, CONSUMER HEALTHCARE AND ANIMAL

HEALTH - AS OUR U.S. OPERATIONS.

REVENUES FROM OPERATIONS OUTSIDE THE U.S. OF $18.3 BILLION ACCOUNTED FOR

40.6% OF OUR TOTAL REVENUES IN 2003. REVENUES EXCEEDED $500 MILLION IN EACH OF

TEN COUNTRIES OUTSIDE THE U.S. IN 2003. THE U.S. WAS THE ONLY COUNTRY TO

CONTRIBUTE MORE THAN 10% OF OUR TOTAL REVENUES. JAPAN IS OUR SECOND-LARGEST

NATIONAL MARKET, WITH 5.9% OF OUR REVENUES IN 2003, 6.1% OF OUR REVENUES IN

2002 AND 6.2% OF OUR REVENUES IN 2001.

OUR INTERNATIONAL BUSINESSES ARE SUBJECT, IN VARYING DEGREES, TO A NUMBER

OF RISKS INHERENT IN CARRYING ON BUSINESS IN OTHER COUNTRIES. THESE INCLUDE

CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS; CAPITAL AND EXCHANGE CONTROL REGULATIONS; EXPROPRIATION

AND NATIONALIZATION; AND OTHER RESTRICTIVE GOVERNMENT ACTIONS. OUR

INTERNATIONAL BUSINESSES ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO GOVERNMENT-IMPOSED CONSTRAINTS,

INCLUDING LAWS ON PRICING OR REIMBURSEMENT FOR USE OF PRODUCTS. SEE

GOVERNMENT

REGULATION AND PRICE CONSTRAINTS

BELOW FOR DISCUSSION OF THESE MATTERS.

DEPENDING ON THE DIRECTION OF CHANGE RELATIVE TO THE U.S. DOLLAR, FOREIGN

CURRENCY VALUES CAN INCREASE OR REDUCE THE REPORTED DOLLAR VALUE OF OUR NET

ASSETS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. IN 2003, REVENUES WERE FAVORABLY IMPACTED BY

FOREIGN EXCHANGE, AS CURRENCY MOVEMENTS RELATIVE TO THE U.S. DOLLAR INCREASED

OUR REPORTED REVENUES IN MANY COUNTRIES. WHILE WE CANNOT PREDICT WITH CERTAINTY

FUTURE CHANGES IN FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES OR THE EFFECT THEY WILL HAVE ON US, WE

ATTEMPT TO MITIGATE THEIR IMPACT THROUGH OPERATIONAL MEANS AND BY USING VARIOUS

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS. SEE THE DISCUSSION UNDER NOTE 5-D TO OUR CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS,

MARKETING

IN OUR GLOBAL PHARMACEUTICAL BUSINESS, WE PROMOTE OUR PRODUCTS TO HEALTH

CARE PROVIDERS SUCH AS DOCTORS, NURSE PRACTITIONERS, PHYSICIAN ASSISTANTS,

PHARMACISTS, HOSPITALS, PHARMACY BENEFIT MANAGERS (PBMS), MANAGED CARE

ORGANIZATIONS (MCOS) AND GOVERNMENT AGENCIES. THROUGH OUR MARKETING

ORGANIZATIONS, WE EXPLAIN THE APPROVED USES AND ADVANTAGES OF OUR PRODUCTS TO

HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS. WE ALSO MARKET DIRECTLY TO CONSUMERS IN THE U.S. THROUGH

DIRECT-TO-CONSUMER PRINT AND TELEVISION ADVERTISING. IN ADDITION, WE SPONSOR

GENERAL ADVERTISING TO EDUCATE THE PUBLIC ABOUT OUR INNOVATIVE MEDICAL

RESEARCH.

OUR OPERATIONS INCLUDE SEVERAL PHARMACEUTICAL SALES ORGANIZATIONS. EACH

SALES ORGANIZATION MARKETS A DISTINCT GROUP OF PRODUCTS. OUR PRESCRIPTION

PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS ARE SOLD PRINCIPALLY TO WHOLESALERS, BUT WE ALSO SELL

DIRECTLY TO RETAILERS, HOSPITALS, CLINICS, GOVERNMENT AGENCIES AND PHARMACIES.

WE SEEK TO GAIN ACCESS TO HEALTH AUTHORITY, PBM AND MCO FORMULARIES (LISTS

OF RECOMMENDED OR APPROVED MEDICINES AND OTHER PRODUCTS) AND REIMBURSEMENT

LISTS BY DEMONSTRATING THE QUALITIES

AND TREATMENT BENEFITS OF OUR PRODUCTS. WE ALSO WORK WITH MCOS AND PBMS TO

ASSIST THEM WITH DISEASE MANAGEMENT, PATIENT EDUCATION AND OTHER TOOLS THAT

HELP THEIR MEDICAL TREATMENT ROUTINES. FOR EXAMPLE, WE SPONSOR A PROGRAM

OFFERED BY THE STATE OF FLORIDA AGENCY FOR HEALTH CARE ADMINISTRATION THAT IS

DESIGNED TO HELP MANAGE CHRONIC DISEASES AMONG FLORIDAS MEDICAID POPULATION.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

OUR CONSUMER HEALTHCARE BUSINESS PRIMARILY USES ITS OWN REPRESENTATIVES TO

DIRECTLY PROMOTE ITS PRODUCTS, INCLUDING MARKETING CERTAIN PRODUCTS DIRECTLY TO

PROFESSIONALS USING A PROFESSIONAL DETAIL FORCE. WE ALSO USE PRINT AND

TELEVISION CONSUMER ADVERTISING AND OFFER SALES INCENTIVES SUCH AS COUPONS. OUR

CONSUMER PRODUCTS ARE SOLD THROUGH VARIOUS RETAILERS.

OUR ANIMAL HEALTH BUSINESS ALSO USES ITS OWN SALES ORGANIZATION TO PROMOTE

ITS PRODUCTS. ITS ADVERTISING AND PROMOTION ARE GENERALLY TARGETED TO HEALTH

PROFESSIONALS, DIRECTLY AND THROUGH MEDICAL JOURNALS. ANIMAL HEALTH AND

NUTRITION PRODUCTS ARE SOLD THROUGH VETERINARIANS, DRUG WHOLESALERS,

DISTRIBUTORS AND RETAIL OUTLETS AS WELL AS DIRECTLY TO USERS. WHERE

APPROPRIATE, THESE PRODUCTS ARE ALSO MARKETED THROUGH PRINT AND TELEVISION

ADVERTISING.

DURING 2003, SALES TO OUR THREE LARGEST CUSTOMERS WERE AS FOLLOWS.



MCKESSON, INC. - 18.4% OF OUR TOTAL REVENUES;



CARDINAL HEALTH, INC. - 14.1% OF OUR TOTAL REVENUES; AND



AMERISOURCEBERGEN CORPORATION - 12.0% OF OUR TOTAL REVENUES.

SALES TO THESE WHOLESALERS WERE CONCENTRATED IN THE PHARMACEUTICAL SEGMENT.

APART FROM THESE INSTANCES, NONE OF OUR BUSINESS SEGMENTS IS DEPENDENT ON ANY

ONE CUSTOMER OR GROUP OF RELATED CUSTOMERS.

PATENTS AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS

OUR PRODUCTS ARE SOLD AROUND THE WORLD UNDER BRAND-NAME, LOGO AND CERTAIN

PRODUCT DESIGN TRADEMARKS THAT WE CONSIDER IN THE AGGREGATE TO BE OF MATERIAL

IMPORTANCE. TRADEMARK PROTECTION CONTINUES IN SOME COUNTRIES FOR AS LONG AS THE

MARK IS USED AND, IN OTHER COUNTRIES, FOR AS LONG AS IT IS REGISTERED.

REGISTRATIONS GENERALLY ARE FOR FIXED, BUT RENEWABLE, TERMS.

WE OWN OR LICENSE A NUMBER OF U.S. AND FOREIGN PATENTS. THESE PATENTS

COVER PHARMACEUTICAL AND OTHER PRODUCTS AND THEIR USES; PHARMACEUTICAL

FORMULATIONS; PRODUCT MANUFACTURING PROCESSES; AND INTERMEDIATE CHEMICAL

COMPOUNDS USED IN MANUFACTURING.

PATENTS FOR INDIVIDUAL PRODUCTS EXTEND FOR VARYING PERIODS ACCORDING TO

THE DATE OF PATENT FILING OR GRANT AND THE LEGAL TERM OF PATENTS IN THE VARIOUS

COUNTRIES WHERE PATENT PROTECTION IS OBTAINED. THE ACTUAL PROTECTION AFFORDED

BY A PATENT, WHICH CAN VARY FROM COUNTRY TO COUNTRY, DEPENDS UPON THE TYPE OF

PATENT, THE SCOPE OF ITS COVERAGE AND THE AVAILABILITY OF LEGAL REMEDIES IN THE

COUNTRY.

IN THE AGGREGATE, OUR PATENT AND RELATED RIGHTS ARE OF MATERIAL IMPORTANCE

TO OUR BUSINESSES IN THE U.S. AND MOST OTHER COUNTRIES. BASED ON CURRENT

PRODUCT SALES, AND CONSIDERING THE VIGOROUS COMPETITION WITH PRODUCTS SOLD BY

OTHERS, THE PATENT RIGHTS WE CONSIDER SIGNIFICANT IN RELATION TO OUR BUSINESS

AS A WHOLE, TOGETHER WITH THE YEAR IN WHICH THE U.S. BASIC PRODUCT PATENT

EXPIRES (INCLUDING, WHERE APPLICABLE, THE ADDITIONAL SIX-MONTH PEDIATRIC

EXCLUSIVITY PERIOD), ARE THOSE FOR THE FOLLOWING DRUGS.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

WHILE THE U.S. BASIC PRODUCT PATENT RELATING TO

ACCUPRIL

EXPIRED IN 2003,

WE HAVE PATENTS ON PARTICULAR FORMULATIONS CONTAINING QUINAPRIL UNTIL 2007. THE

U.S. BASIC PRODUCT PATENT RELATING TO

DIFLUCAN

EXPIRED IN JANUARY 2004. THE FDA

HAS GRANTED US PEDIATRIC EXCLUSIVITY WITH RESPECT TO

DIFLUCAN

, WHICH EXTENDS

OUR MARKETING EXCLUSIVITY FOR SIX MONTHS AFTER THE PATENT EXPIRATION DATE,

THROUGH JULY 29, 2004. THE FDAS GRANT OF PEDIATRIC EXCLUSIVITY IS THE SUBJECT

OF A PENDING LEGAL CHALLENGE. SEE ITEM 3,

ZITHROMAX

IS PATENTED BY PLIVA, A CROATIAN PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANY. THE

DRUG IS LICENSED EXCLUSIVELY TO US BY PLIVA FOR SALES AND MARKETING IN MAJOR

COUNTRIES, AND WE PURCHASE THE COMPOUND IN BULK CRUDE FORM FROM PLIVA.

ZYRTEC

IS PATENTED BY THE BELGIAN COMPANY UCB S.A. AND IS LICENSED TO US

FOR SALES IN THE U.S., CANADA, EUROPE, AUSTRALIA AND SOUTH AFRICA. WE COPROMOTE

ZYRTEC

AS A PRESCRIPTION MEDICINE IN THE U.S. WITH A SUBSIDIARY OF UCB S.A. AND

HAVE A LICENSE TO SELL

ZYRTEC

UNDER VARIOUS TRADE NAMES AS AN OTC MEDICINE IN

THE OTHER MARKETS.

ARICEPT

IS PATENTED BY EISAI CO., LTD. WE COPROMOTE

ARICEPT

WITH EISAI IN

THE U.S. AND SEVERAL OTHER COUNTRIES AND HAVE AN EXCLUSIVE LICENSE TO SELL THE

DRUG IN CERTAIN OTHER COUNTRIES.

XALATAN

IS NOT PROTECTED BY A BASIC PRODUCT PATENT. HOWEVER, WE HAVE

BROADLY PATENTED OPHTHALMIC FORMULATIONS CONTAINING LANTANOPROST UNTIL 2011.

GENOTROPIN

IN AN ACTION ALLEGING PATENT INFRINGEMENT WITH RESPECT TO OUR SALES OF

CELEBREX

AND

BEXTRA

. SEE ITEM 3,

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

, BELOW.

WE HAVE OTHER PATENT RIGHTS COVERING ADDITIONAL PRODUCTS THAT HAVE LESSER

REVENUES.

THE EXPIRATION OF A BASIC PRODUCT PATENT OR LOSS OF PATENT PROTECTION

RESULTING FROM A LEGAL CHALLENGE NORMALLY RESULTS IN SIGNIFICANT COMPETITION

FROM GENERIC PRODUCTS AGAINST THE COVERED PRODUCT AND CAN RESULT IN A

SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN SALES OF THE PIONEER PRODUCT IN A VERY SHORT PERIOD.

IN SOME CASES, HOWEVER, WE CAN CONTINUE TO OBTAIN COMMERCIAL BENEFITS FROM

PRODUCT MANUFACTURING TRADE SECRETS; PATENTS ON USES FOR PRODUCTS; PATENTS ON

PROCESSES AND INTERMEDIATES FOR THE ECONOMICAL MANUFACTURE OF THE ACTIVE

INGREDIENTS; PATENTS FOR SPECIAL FORMULATIONS OF THE PRODUCT OR DELIVERY

MECHANISMS; AND CONVERSION OF THE ACTIVE INGREDIENT TO OTC PRODUCTS.

ONE OF THE MAIN LIMITATIONS ON OUR OPERATIONS IN SOME COUNTRIES OUTSIDE

THE U.S. IS THE LACK OF EFFECTIVE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY PROTECTION OF OUR

PRODUCTS. UNDER INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS IN RECENT YEARS, GLOBAL PROTECTION OF

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS IS IMPROVING. THE GENERAL AGREEMENT ON TARIFFS AND

TRADE REQUIRES PARTICIPANT COUNTRIES TO AMEND THEIR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY LAWS

TO PROVIDE PATENT PROTECTION FOR PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS BY THE END OF A

TEN-YEAR TRANSITION PERIOD. A NUMBER OF COUNTRIES ARE DOING THIS. WE HAVE

EXPERIENCED SIGNIFICANT GROWTH IN OUR BUSINESSES IN SOME OF THOSE NATIONS, AND

OUR CONTINUED BUSINESS EXPANSION IN THOSE COUNTRIES DEPENDS TO A LARGE DEGREE

ON FURTHER PATENT PROTECTION IMPROVEMENT.

COMPETITION

COMPETITION IS INTENSE IN ALL OF OUR BUSINESSES AND INCLUDES MANY LARGE

AND SMALL COMPETITORS. THE PRINCIPAL MEANS OF COMPETITION VARY AMONG PRODUCT

CATEGORIES AND BUSINESS GROUPS. HOWEVER, EFFICACY, SAFETY, PATIENTS AND

CUSTOMERS EASE OF USE AND COST EFFECTIVENESS ARE IMPORTANT FACTORS FOR SUCCESS

IN ALL OF OUR PRINCIPAL BUSINESSES.

OUR HUMAN PHARMACEUTICAL BUSINESS IS THE LARGEST IN THE WORLD. WE COMPETE

WITH OTHER WORLDWIDE RESEARCH-BASED DRUG COMPANIES, MANY SMALLER RESEARCH

COMPANIES WITH MORE LIMITED THERAPEUTIC FOCUS AND GENERIC DRUG MANUFACTURERS.

9

TABLE OF CONTENTS

WE FOCUS ON UNMET MEDICAL NEEDS AND THERAPEUTIC IMPROVEMENTS. OUR EMPHASIS

ON INNOVATION HAS LED TO OUR MULTI-BILLION-DOLLAR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

INVESTMENTS OVER THE PAST DECADE.

IN RECENT YEARS, A COMPARISON OF THE TOTAL COST OF MEDICAL TREATMENTS

USING PHARMACEUTICALS VERSUS ALTERNATIVE TREATMENTS FOR THE SAME CONDITION HAS

BECOME AN IMPORTANT BASIS OF COMPETITION. MCOS AND PBMS LOOK TO COST ADVANTAGES

AS WELL AS MEDICAL BENEFITS IN MAKING THEIR DRUG FORMULARY DECISIONS.

OUR PHARMACEUTICAL SALES AND MARKETING ORGANIZATION IS A VALUABLE

COMPETITIVE ASSET. OUR SALESPEOPLES ABILITY TO REACH MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS

WITH INFORMATION ABOUT OUR PRODUCTS HELPS US RESPOND TO COMPETITIVE EFFORTS AND

LAUNCH NEW PRODUCTS.

OUR CONSUMER HEALTHCARE BUSINESS IS ONE OF THE LARGEST IN THE WORLD.

HOWEVER, MANY OTHER COMPANIES, LARGE AND SMALL, MANUFACTURE AND SELL ONE OR

MORE PRODUCTS THAT ARE SIMILAR TO OUR CONSUMER HEALTHCARE PRODUCTS. SOURCES OF

COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE INCLUDE PRODUCT QUALITY AND EFFICACY, BRAND IDENTITY,

ADVERTISING AND PROMOTION, PRODUCT INNOVATION, BROAD DISTRIBUTION CAPABILITIES

AND PRICE. SIGNIFICANT EXPENDITURES FOR ADVERTISING, PROMOTION AND MARKETING

ARE GENERALLY REQUIRED TO ACHIEVE AND MAINTAIN BOTH CONSUMER AND TRADE

ACCEPTANCE OF CONSUMER PRODUCTS.

WHILE OUR ANIMAL HEALTH BUSINESS IS THE LARGEST IN THE WORLD, MANY OTHER

COMPANIES OFFER COMPETITIVE PRODUCTS. ALTOGETHER, THERE ARE HUNDREDS OF

PRODUCERS OF ANIMAL HEALTH PRODUCTS THROUGHOUT THE WORLD. THE PRINCIPAL METHODS

OF COMPETITION VARY SOMEWHAT DEPENDING ON THE PARTICULAR PRODUCT. THEY INCLUDE

PRODUCT INNOVATION, QUALITY, SERVICE, EFFECTIVE PROMOTION TO VETERINARY

PROFESSIONALS AND CONSUMERS AND PRICE. WE PROMOTE OUR PRODUCTS DIRECTLY THROUGH

OUR SALES REPRESENTATIVES AS WELL AS THROUGH ADVERTISING.

MANAGED CARE ORGANIZATIONS

THE GROWTH OF MCOS IN THE U.S. HAS BEEN A MAJOR FACTOR IN THE COMPETITIVE

MAKE-UP OF THE HEALTH CARE MARKETPLACE. A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF THE U.S.

POPULATION NOW PARTICIPATES IN SOME VERSION OF MANAGED CARE. BECAUSE OF THE

SIZE OF THE PATIENT POPULATION COVERED BY MCOS, MARKETING OF PRESCRIPTION DRUGS

TO THEM AND THE PBMS THAT SERVE MANY OF THOSE ORGANIZATIONS HAS BECOME

IMPORTANT TO OUR BUSINESS.

MCOS CAN INCLUDE MEDICAL INSURANCE COMPANIES, MEDICAL PLAN ADMINISTRATORS,

HEALTH-MAINTENANCE ORGANIZATIONS, ALLIANCES OF HOSPITALS AND PHYSICIANS AND

OTHER PHYSICIAN ORGANIZATIONS. THE PURCHASING POWER OF MCOS HAS BEEN INCREASING

IN RECENT YEARS DUE TO THEIR GROWING NUMBERS OF ENROLLED PATIENTS. AT THE SAME

TIME, THOSE ORGANIZATIONS HAVE BEEN CONSOLIDATING INTO FEWER, EVEN LARGER

ENTITIES. THIS ENHANCES THEIR PURCHASING STRENGTH AND IMPORTANCE TO US.

THE GROWTH OF MCOS HAS INCREASED PRESSURE ON DRUG PRICES. A MAJOR

OBJECTIVE OF MCOS IS TO CONTAIN AND, WHERE POSSIBLE, REDUCE HEALTH CARE

EXPENDITURES. THEY TYPICALLY USE FORMULARIES, VOLUME PURCHASES AND LONG-TERM

CONTRACTS TO NEGOTIATE DISCOUNTS FROM PHARMACEUTICAL PROVIDERS. THEY USE THEIR

PURCHASING POWER TO BARGAIN FOR LOWER SUPPLIER PRICES. THEY ALSO EMPHASIZE

PRIMARY AND PREVENTIVE CARE, OUT-PATIENT TREATMENT AND PROCEDURES PERFORMED AT

DOCTORS OFFICES AND CLINICS. HOSPITALIZATION AND SURGERY, TYPICALLY THE MOST

EXPENSIVE FORMS OF TREATMENT, ARE CAREFULLY MANAGED. SINCE THE USE OF CERTAIN

DRUGS CAN PREVENT THE NEED FOR HOSPITALIZATION, PROFESSIONAL THERAPY OR EVEN

SURGERY, SUCH DRUGS CAN BECOME FAVORED FIRST-LINE TREATMENTS FOR CERTAIN

DISEASES.

AS DISCUSSED ABOVE IN

MARKETING

, MCOS AND PBMS TYPICALLY DEVELOP

FORMULARIES TO REDUCE THEIR COST FOR MEDICATIONS. FORMULARIES CAN BE BASED ON

THE PRICES AND THERAPEUTIC BENEFITS OF THE AVAILABLE PRODUCTS. DUE TO THEIR

GENERALLY LOWER

COST, GENERIC MEDICINES ARE OFTEN FAVORED. THE BREADTH OF THE PRODUCTS

COVERED BY FORMULARIES CAN VARY CONSIDERABLY FROM ONE MCO TO ANOTHER, AND MANY

FORMULARIES INCLUDE ALTERNATIVE AND COMPETITIVE PRODUCTS FOR TREATMENT OF

PARTICULAR MEDICAL PROBLEMS. MCOS USE A VARIETY OF MEANS TO ENCOURAGE PATIENTS

USE OF PRODUCTS LISTED ON THEIR FORMULARIES.

EXCLUSION OF A PRODUCT FROM A FORMULARY CAN LEAD TO ITS SHARPLY REDUCED

USAGE IN THE MCO PATIENT POPULATION. CONSEQUENTLY, PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES

COMPETE AGGRESSIVELY TO HAVE THEIR PRODUCTS INCLUDED. WHERE POSSIBLE, COMPANIES

10

TABLE OF CONTENTS

COMPETE FOR INCLUSION BASED UPON UNIQUE FEATURES OF THEIR PRODUCTS, SUCH AS

GREATER EFFICACY, BETTER PATIENT EASE OF USE OR FEWER SIDE EFFECTS. A LOWER

OVERALL COST OF THERAPY IS ALSO AN IMPORTANT FACTOR. PRODUCTS THAT DEMONSTRATE

FEWER THERAPEUTIC ADVANTAGES MUST COMPETE FOR INCLUSION BASED PRIMARILY ON

PRICE. WE HAVE BEEN GENERALLY, ALTHOUGH NOT UNIVERSALLY, SUCCESSFUL IN HAVING

OUR MAJOR PRODUCTS INCLUDED ON MCO FORMULARIES.

THE IMPACT OF MCOS ON DRUG PRICES AND VOLUMES MAY INCREASE AS THE RESULT

OF THEIR ROLE IN NEGOTIATING ON BEHALF OF MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES IN CONNECTION

WITH THE RECENTLY ENACTED, LIMITED OUT-PATIENT DRUG BENEFIT UNDER MEDICARE, AS

DISCUSSED BELOW UNDER

GOVERNMENT REGULATION AND PRICE CONSTRAINTS.

ANOTHER WAY WE ADDRESS THE INTERESTS OF MCOS IS BY DEVELOPING

DISEASE-MANAGEMENT PROGRAMS. THESE PROGRAMS CAN BE ATTRACTIVE TO MCOS BY

IMPROVING PATIENT COMMUNICATIONS AND COMPLIANCE WITH DOSAGE DIRECTIONS, WHICH

ARE IMPORTANT FOR EFFECTIVE DISEASE TREATMENT. THEY CAN HELP MCOS ADDRESS

VARIOUS ASPECTS OF DISEASE MANAGEMENT, SUCH AS PREVENTION, DIAGNOSIS AND

TREATMENT OF CERTAIN DISEASES, INCLUDING USE OF PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS. THIS

COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH CAN IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF CARE AND LOWER COSTLY

COMPLICATIONS OF CHRONIC DISEASES. AS NOTED ABOVE IN

MARKETING

, ONE SUCH

PROGRAM, WHICH IS SPONSORED BY US AND OFFERED BY THE STATE OF FLORIDA AGENCY

FOR HEALTH CARE ADMINISTRATION, IS DESIGNED TO HELP MANAGE CHRONIC DISEASES

AMONG FLORIDAS MEDICAID POPULATION.

GENERIC PRODUCTS

ONE OF THE BIGGEST COMPETITIVE CHALLENGES THAT WE FACE IN THE U.S. AND

THAT IS GROWING INTERNATIONALLY IS FROM GENERIC PHARMACEUTICAL MANUFACTURERS.

UPON THE EXPIRATION OR LOSS OF PATENT PROTECTION FOR A PRODUCT, WE CAN LOSE THE

MAJOR PORTION OF SALES OF THAT PRODUCT IN A VERY SHORT PERIOD. GENERIC

COMPETITORS OPERATE WITHOUT OUR LARGE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES AND OUR

COSTS OF CONVEYING MEDICAL INFORMATION ABOUT THE PRODUCT TO THE MEDICAL

COMMUNITY. IN ADDITION, THE FDA APPROVAL PROCESS EXEMPTS GENERICS FROM COSTLY

AND TIME-CONSUMING CLINICAL TRIALS TO DEMONSTRATE THEIR SAFETY AND EFFICACY,

AND ALLOWS GENERIC MANUFACTURERS TO RELY ON THE SAFETY AND EFFICACY OF THE

PIONEER PRODUCT. GENERIC PRODUCTS NEED ONLY DEMONSTRATE A LEVEL OF AVAILABILITY

IN THE BLOODSTREAM EQUIVALENT TO THAT OF THE PIONEER PRODUCT. THIS MEANS THAT,

AFTER WE HAVE BORNE THE EXPENSES OF DISCOVERING, DEVELOPING AND TESTING A

MEDICINE FOR SAFETY AND EFFICACY, OBTAINING REGULATORY APPROVAL AND INFORMING

THE MEDICAL COMMUNITY ABOUT ITS THERAPEUTIC BENEFITS, GENERIC COMPETITORS CAN

MARKET A COMPETING VERSION OF OUR PRODUCT AFTER THE EXPIRATION OR LOSS OF OUR

PATENT AND CHARGE MUCH LESS.

AS NOTED ABOVE, MCOS THAT FOCUS PRIMARILY ON THE IMMEDIATE COST OF DRUGS

OFTEN FAVOR GENERICS OVER BRAND-NAME DRUGS. MANY GOVERNMENTS ALSO ENCOURAGE THE

USE OF GENERICS AS ALTERNATIVES TO BRAND-NAME DRUGS IN THEIR HEALTH CARE

PROGRAMS, INCLUDING MEDICAID IN THE U.S. LAWS IN THE U.S. GENERALLY ALLOW, AND

IN SOME CASES REQUIRE, PHARMACISTS TO SUBSTITUTE GENERIC DRUGS THAT HAVE BEEN

RATED UNDER GOVERNMENT PROCEDURES TO BE THERAPEUTICALLY EQUIVALENT TO A

BRAND-NAME DRUG. THE SUBSTITUTION MUST BE MADE UNLESS THE PRESCRIBING PHYSICIAN

EXPRESSLY FORBIDS IT.

RAW MATERIALS

RAW MATERIALS ESSENTIAL TO OUR BUSINESSES ARE PURCHASED WORLDWIDE IN THE

ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS FROM NUMEROUS SUPPLIERS. IN GENERAL, THESE

MATERIALS ARE AVAILABLE FROM MULTIPLE SOURCES. NO SERIOUS SHORTAGES OR DELAYS

WERE ENCOUNTERED IN 2003, AND NONE ARE EXPECTED IN 2004.

GOVERNMENT REGULATION AND PRICE CONSTRAINTS

IN THE UNITED STATES

GENERAL

. PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES ARE SUBJECT TO EXTENSIVE REGULATION BY

NATIONAL, STATE AND LOCAL AGENCIES IN THE COUNTRIES IN WHICH THEY DO BUSINESS.

OF PARTICULAR IMPORTANCE IS THE FDA IN THE U.S. IT HAS JURISDICTION OVER OUR

HUMAN PHARMACEUTICAL BUSINESS AND ADMINISTERS REQUIREMENTS COVERING THE

TESTING, SAFETY, EFFECTIVENESS, MANUFACTURING, LABELING, MARKETING, ADVERTISING

AND POST-MARKETING SURVEILLANCE OF OUR PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS. THE FDA ALSO

REGULATES MOST OF OUR CONSUMER HEALTHCARE PRODUCTS AND, ALONG WITH THE U.S.

DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE AND

11

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE U.S. ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY, OUR

ANIMAL HEALTH PRODUCTS.

IN ADDITION, WE ARE SUBJECT TO THE JURISDICTION OF VARIOUS OTHER FEDERAL

REGULATORY AND ENFORCEMENT DEPARTMENTS AND AGENCIES, SUCH AS THE DEPARTMENT OF

HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES, THE FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION AND THE DEPARTMENT OF

JUSTICE. INDIVIDUAL STATES, ACTING THROUGH THEIR ATTORNEYS GENERAL, HAVE BECOME

ACTIVE AS WELL, SEEKING TO REGULATE THE MARKETING OF PRESCRIPTION DRUGS UNDER

STATE CONSUMER PROTECTION AND FALSE ADVERTISING LAWS.

WE ARE SUBJECT TO POSSIBLE ADMINISTRATIVE AND LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND

ACTIONS BY THESE VARIOUS REGULATORY BODIES (SEE ITEM 3,

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

,

BELOW). SUCH ACTIONS MAY INCLUDE PRODUCT RECALLS, SEIZURES AND OTHER CIVIL AND

CRIMINAL SANCTIONS.

MEDICARE

. IN DECEMBER 2003, THE MEDICARE PRESCRIPTION DRUG IMPROVEMENT AND

MODERNIZATION ACT OF 2003 (THE 2003 MEDICARE ACT) WAS ENACTED. UNDER THIS

LEGISLATION, MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES WILL BE ELIGIBLE TO OBTAIN A

MEDICARE-ENDORSED, DRUG-DISCOUNT CARD FROM AN MCO, PBM OR OTHER PRIVATE SECTOR

PROVIDER BEGINNING IN THE SPRING OF 2004 AND CONTINUING THROUGH 2005. THEN,

BEGINNING IN 2006, MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES WILL BE ELIGIBLE TO PURCHASE

PRESCRIPTION DRUG COVERAGE WITH LIMITED BENEFITS FROM A PRIVATE SECTOR

PROVIDER. AT THIS EARLY STAGE, IT IS DIFFICULT TO PREDICT THE IMPACT OF THE

2003 MEDICARE ACT ON PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES. USAGE OF PHARMACEUTICALS MAY

INCREASE AS THE RESULT OF THE EXPANDED ACCESS TO MEDICINES AFFORDED BY THE

PARTIAL REIMBURSEMENT UNDER MEDICARE. SUCH POTENTIAL SALES INCREASES, HOWEVER,

MAY BE OFFSET BY INCREASED PRICING PRESSURES DUE TO THE ENHANCED PURCHASING

POWER OF THE PRIVATE SECTOR PROVIDERS THAT WILL NEGOTIATE ON BEHALF OF MEDICARE

BENEFICIARIES.

IN 2002, WE IMPLEMENTED THE PFIZER FOR LIVING SHARE CARD PROGRAM IN ORDER

TO HELP ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF AFFORDABLE ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE FOR THOSE MOST IN

NEED. THROUGH THIS PROGRAM, LOW-INCOME MEDICARE RECIPIENTS WITHOUT PRESCRIPTION

DRUG COVERAGE CAN PURCHASE 30-DAY PRESCRIPTIONS OF ANY PFIZER PRESCRIPTION

MEDICINE AND OF THE COPROMOTED PRODUCT

ARICEPT

AT MANY RETAIL PHARMACIES FOR

$15. WE REMAIN COMMITTED TO THIS OR SIMILAR PROGRAMS UNTIL MEDICARE

BENEFICIARIES ARE ELIGIBLE TO PURCHASE PRESCRIPTION DRUG COVERAGE BEGINNING IN

2006.

IMPORTATION

OF DRUGS

. THERE IS CONSIDERABLE POLITICAL PRESSURE TO ALLOW

THE IMPORTATION INTO THE U.S. OF PRESCRIPTION DRUGS THAT ARE MANUFACTURED

OUTSIDE THE U.S. AND SOLD AT PRICES THAT ARE REGULATED BY THE GOVERNMENTS OF

VARIOUS FOREIGN COUNTRIES. IN ADDITION TO RAISING SAFETY CONCERNS, SUCH

IMPORTATION COULD IMPACT PHARMACEUTICAL PRICES IN THE U.S. WHILE THE 2003

MEDICARE ACT MAINTAINS THE CURRENT PROHIBITION ON SUCH IMPORTS, IT WOULD ALLOW

IMPORTATION FROM CANADA IF THE SECRETARY OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES CERTIFIES

THAT SUCH IMPORTATION IS SAFE AND WOULD RESULT IN SAVINGS TO CONSUMERS. BEFORE

THE 2003 MEDICARE ACT, FEDERAL LAW WOULD HAVE PERMITTED IMPORTATION OF

MEDICINES INTO THE U.S. FROM A CONSIDERABLY LARGER GROUP OF DEVELOPED

COUNTRIES, PROVIDED THE SECRETARY OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES MADE THE SAME

SAFETY AND COST-SAVINGS CERTIFICATIONS.

MEDICAID

AND RELATED MATTERS

. IN RECENT YEARS, VARIOUS PROPOSALS HAVE BEEN

OFFERED AT THE FEDERAL AND STATE LEVELS THAT WOULD BRING ABOUT MAJOR CHANGES IN

THE MEDICAID PROGRAM. DRIVEN BY BUDGET CONCERNS, SOME STATES HAVE IMPLEMENTED

AND OTHER STATES ARE CONSIDERING PRICE CONTROLS OR PATIENT-ACCESS CONSTRAINTS

ON MEDICINES UNDER THE MEDICAID PROGRAM. IF CHANGES ARE IMPLEMENTED UNDER THE

MEDICAID PROGRAM THAT RESTRICT THE ACCESS OF A SIGNIFICANT POPULATION OF

PATIENTS TO OUR INNOVATIVE MEDICINES, OUR BUSINESS COULD BE MATERIALLY

AFFECTED. IN ADDITION, SOME STATES ARE CONSIDERING PRICE-CONTROL REGIMES THAT

WOULD APPLY TO ALL OF THEIR RESIDENTS, REGARDLESS OF

INCOME, AS WELL AS VARIOUS APPROACHES TO CONTROLLING PHARMACEUTICAL

MARKETING.

U.S. LAW REQUIRES US TO GIVE REBATES TO STATE MEDICAID AGENCIES BASED ON

EACH STATES REIMBURSEMENT OF PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS UNDER THE MEDICAID

PROGRAM. SOME STATES ARE SEEKING REBATES IN EXCESS OF THE AMOUNTS REQUIRED BY

FEDERAL LAW, AND THERE ARE FEDERAL LEGISLATIVE PROPOSALS TO EXPAND CURRENT

MEDICAID REBATES. WE ALSO MUST GIVE DISCOUNTS OR REBATES ON PURCHASES OR

HATCH-WAXMAN

ACT

. UNDER THE 1984 DRUG PRICE COMPETITION AND PATENT TERM

RESTORATION ACT, KNOWN AS THE HATCH-WAXMAN ACT, IF A GENERIC DRUG COMPANY FILES

AN ABBREVIATED NEW DRUG APPLICATION WITH THE FDA AND A RESEARCH-BASED DRUG

COMPANY PROMPTLY FILES A LAWSUIT ALLEGING THAT THE GENERIC PRODUCT WOULD

INFRINGE ONE OR MORE OF ITS PATENTS, APPROVAL OF THE ABBREVIATED NEW DRUG

APPLICATION BY THE FDA AUTOMATICALLY IS STAYED FOR A PERIOD OF UP TO 30 MONTHS

(BUT NOT BEYOND THE EXPIRATION DATE OF THE PATENTS). THE 2003 MEDICARE ACT

INCLUDES AN AMENDMENT TO THE HATCH-WAXMAN ACT PROVIDING THAT SUCH 30-MONTH

STAYS APPLY ONLY TO PATENTS THAT ARE SUBMITTED TO THE FDA BEFORE THE SUBMISSION

OF AN ABBREVIATED NEW DRUG APPLICATION BY A GENERIC COMPANY. THIS PROVISION HAS

THE EFFECT OF PREVENTING MULTIPLE STAYS WHEN ADDITIONAL PATENTS ARE ISSUED

AFTER AN ABBREVIATED NEW DRUG APPLICATION HAS BEEN FILED. THE AMENDMENT ALSO

REQUIRES THAT AGREEMENTS BETWEEN RESEARCH-BASED COMPANIES AND GENERIC DRUG

COMPANIES RELATING TO EITHER A BRAND-NAME DRUG OR A GENERIC DRUG BE FILED WITH

THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE AND THE FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION.

OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES

WE ENCOUNTER SIMILAR REGULATORY AND LEGISLATIVE ISSUES IN MOST OTHER

COUNTRIES. IN EUROPE AND SOME OTHER INTERNATIONAL MARKETS, THE GOVERNMENT

PROVIDES HEALTH CARE AT LOW DIRECT COST TO CONSUMERS AND REGULATES

PHARMACEUTICAL PRICES OR PATIENT REIMBURSEMENT LEVELS TO CONTROL COSTS FOR THE

GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED HEALTH CARE SYSTEM. THIS INTERNATIONAL PATCHWORK OF PRICE

REGULATION HAS LED TO DIFFERENT PRICES AND SOME THIRD-PARTY TRADE IN OUR

PRODUCTS FROM MARKETS WITH LOWER PRICES. SUCH TRADE EXPLOITING PRICE

DIFFERENCES BETWEEN COUNTRIES CAN UNDERMINE OUR SALES IN MARKETS WITH HIGHER

PRICES.

SINCE 1998, THE APPROVAL OF NEW DRUGS ACROSS THE EU IS POSSIBLE ONLY USING

THE EUROPEAN MEDICINES EVALUATION AGENCYS (EMEA) MUTUAL RECOGNITION OR CENTRAL

APPROVAL PROCESSES. THE USE OF EITHER OF THESE PROCEDURES PROVIDES A MORE RAPID

AND CONSISTENT APPROVAL WITHIN THE MEMBER STATES THAN WAS THE CASE WHEN THE

APPROVAL PROCESSES WERE OPERATING INDEPENDENTLY WITHIN EACH MEMBER STATE.

FURTHER, NORWAY AND ICELAND ARE FULL PARTICIPANTS IN THE EU CENTRAL APPROVAL

PROCESSES. THE ADDITION OF TEN NEW MEMBER STATES TO THE EU IN MAY 2004 WILL

EXTEND THE SCOPE OF THESE APPROVAL PROCEDURES. SINCE THE EMEA DOES NOT HAVE

JURISDICTION OVER PATIENT REIMBURSEMENT OR PRICING MATTERS IN EU MEMBER STATES,

WE WILL CONTINUE TO DEAL WITH INDIVIDUAL COUNTRIES ON SUCH ISSUES ACROSS THE

ENLARGED EU.

ENVIRONMENTAL LAW COMPLIANCE

MOST OF OUR MANUFACTURING AND CERTAIN OF OUR RESEARCH OPERATIONS ARE

AFFECTED BY FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS. WE HAVE MADE, AND

INTEND TO CONTINUE TO MAKE, NECESSARY EXPENDITURES FOR COMPLIANCE WITH

APPLICABLE LAWS. WE ALSO ARE CLEANING UP ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINATION FROM PAST

INDUSTRIAL ACTIVITY AT CERTAIN SITES (SEE ITEM 3,

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

, BELOW). AS

A RESULT, WE INCURRED CAPITAL AND OPERATIONAL EXPENDITURES IN 2003 FOR THE

CLEAN-UP OF CERTAIN PAST INDUSTRIAL ACTIVITY AND FOR OTHER ENVIRONMENTAL

PROTECTION PURPOSES AS FOLLOWS.



ENVIRONMENT-RELATED CAPITAL EXPENDITURES - $45 MILLION



OTHER ENVIRONMENT-RELATED EXPENSES - $209 MILLION

WHILE WE CANNOT PREDICT WITH CERTAINTY FUTURE CAPITAL EXPENDITURES OR

OPERATING COSTS FOR ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLIANCE, WE DO NOT BELIEVE THEY WILL HAVE

A MATERIAL EFFECT ON OUR CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, EARNINGS OR COMPETITIVE

POSITION.

TAX MATTERS

EMPLOYEES

IN OUR INNOVATION-INTENSIVE BUSINESS, OUR EMPLOYEES ARE VITAL TO OUR

SUCCESS. WE BELIEVE WE HAVE GOOD RELATIONSHIPS WITH OUR EMPLOYEES. AS OF

THROUGHOUT THE WORLD.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

CAUTIONARY FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT FUTURE RESULTS

(CAUTIONARY STATEMENTS UNDER THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT

OF 1995)

OUR DISCLOSURE AND ANALYSIS IN THIS 2003 FORM 10-K AND IN OUR 2003 ANNUAL

REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS CONTAIN SOME FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS THAT SET FORTH

ANTICIPATED RESULTS BASED ON MANAGEMENTS PLANS AND ASSUMPTIONS. FROM TIME TO

TIME, WE ALSO PROVIDE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS IN OTHER MATERIALS WE RELEASE

TO THE PUBLIC AS WELL AS ORAL FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS. SUCH STATEMENTS GIVE

OUR CURRENT EXPECTATIONS OR FORECASTS OF FUTURE EVENTS; THEY DO NOT RELATE

STRICTLY TO HISTORICAL OR CURRENT FACTS. WE HAVE TRIED, WHEREVER POSSIBLE, TO

IDENTIFY SUCH STATEMENTS BY USING WORDS SUCH AS ANTICIPATE, ESTIMATE,

EXPECT, PROJECT, INTEND, PLAN, BELIEVE, WILL AND SIMILAR

EXPRESSIONS IN CONNECTION WITH ANY DISCUSSION OF FUTURE OPERATING OR FINANCIAL

PERFORMANCE. IN PARTICULAR, THESE INCLUDE STATEMENTS RELATING TO FUTURE

ACTIONS, PROSPECTIVE PRODUCTS OR PRODUCT APPROVALS, FUTURE PERFORMANCE OR

RESULTS OF CURRENT AND ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS, SALES EFFORTS, EXPENSES, INTEREST

RATES, FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES, THE OUTCOME OF CONTINGENCIES, SUCH AS LEGAL

PROCEEDINGS, AND FINANCIAL RESULTS.

WE CANNOT GUARANTEE THAT ANY FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENT WILL BE REALIZED,

ALTHOUGH WE BELIEVE WE HAVE BEEN PRUDENT IN OUR PLANS AND ASSUMPTIONS.

ACHIEVEMENT OF FUTURE RESULTS IS SUBJECT TO RISKS, UNCERTAINTIES AND

POTENTIALLY INACCURATE ASSUMPTIONS. SHOULD KNOWN OR UNKNOWN RISKS OR

UNCERTAINTIES MATERIALIZE, OR SHOULD UNDERLYING ASSUMPTIONS PROVE INACCURATE,

ACTUAL RESULTS COULD DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM PAST RESULTS AND THOSE ANTICIPATED,

ESTIMATED OR PROJECTED. YOU SHOULD BEAR THIS IN MIND AS YOU CONSIDER

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS.

WE UNDERTAKE NO OBLIGATION TO PUBLICLY UPDATE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS,

WHETHER AS A RESULT OF NEW INFORMATION, FUTURE EVENTS OR OTHERWISE. YOU ARE

ADVISED, HOWEVER, TO CONSULT ANY FURTHER DISCLOSURES WE MAKE ON RELATED

SUBJECTS IN OUR 10-Q AND 8-K REPORTS TO THE SEC. ALSO NOTE THAT WE PROVIDE THE

FOLLOWING CAUTIONARY DISCUSSION OF RISKS, UNCERTAINTIES AND POSSIBLY INACCURATE

ASSUMPTIONS RELEVANT TO OUR BUSINESSES. THESE ARE FACTORS THAT, INDIVIDUALLY OR

IN THE AGGREGATE, WE THINK COULD CAUSE OUR ACTUAL RESULTS TO DIFFER MATERIALLY

FROM EXPECTED AND HISTORICAL RESULTS. WE NOTE THESE FACTORS FOR INVESTORS AS

PERMITTED BY THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995. YOU SHOULD

UNDERSTAND THAT IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO PREDICT OR IDENTIFY ALL SUCH FACTORS.

CONSEQUENTLY, YOU SHOULD NOT CONSIDER THE FOLLOWING TO BE A COMPLETE DISCUSSION

OF ALL POTENTIAL RISKS OR UNCERTAINTIES.

 U.S. AND FOREIGN GOVERNMENTAL REGULATIONS MANDATING PRICE CONTROLS AND

PATIENT-ACCESS CONSTRAINTS IMPACT OUR BUSINESS, AND OUR FUTURE RESULTS COULD BE

AFFECTED BY CHANGES IN SUCH REGULATIONS. IN THE U.S., MANY PHARMACEUTICAL

PRODUCTS ARE SUBJECT TO INCREASING PRICING PRESSURES. SUCH PRESSURES MAY

INCREASE AS THE RESULT OF THE 2003 MEDICARE ACT. ON THE OTHER HAND, USAGE OF

PHARMACEUTICALS ALSO MAY INCREASE DUE TO THE EXPANDED ACCESS TO MEDICINES

AFFORDED BY THE PARTIAL REIMBURSEMENT UNDER THE 2003 MEDICARE ACT. IN ADDITION, MCOS AS WELL

AS MEDICAID AND OTHER GOVERNMENT AGENCIES CONTINUE TO SEEK PRICE DISCOUNTS.

GOVERNMENT EFFORTS TO REDUCE MEDICAID EXPENSES MAY CONTINUE TO

INCREASE THE USE OF MCOS. THIS MAY RESULT IN MANAGED CARES INFLUENCING

PRESCRIPTION DECISIONS FOR A LARGER SEGMENT OF THE POPULATION. IN ADDITION,

SOME STATES HAVE IMPLEMENTED AND OTHER STATES ARE CONSIDERING PRICE CONTROLS OR

PATIENT-ACCESS CONSTRAINTS UNDER THE MEDICAID PROGRAM, AND SOME STATES ARE

CONSIDERING PRICE-CONTROL REGIMES THAT

WOULD APPLY TO ALL OF THEIR RESIDENTS, REGARDLESS OF INCOME. OTHER MATTERS THAT

COULD BE THE SUBJECT OF U.S. LEGISLATIVE OR REGULATORY ACTION AFFECTING OUR

BUSINESS INCLUDE THE IMPORTATION OF PRESCRIPTION DRUGS THAT ARE MANUFACTURED

OUTSIDE THE U.S. AND SOLD AT PRICES THAT ARE REGULATED BY THE GOVERNMENTS OF

VARIOUS FOREIGN COUNTRIES AND THE INVOLUNTARY APPROVAL OF PRESCRIPTION

MEDICINES FOR OTC USE.

WE ENCOUNTER SIMILAR REGULATORY AND LEGISLATIVE ISSUES IN MOST OTHER

COUNTRIES. IN EUROPE AND SOME OTHER INTERNATIONAL MARKETS, THE GOVERNMENT

PROVIDES HEALTH CARE AT LOW DIRECT COST TO CONSUMERS AND REGULATES

PHARMACEUTICAL PRICES OR PATIENT REIMBURSEMENT LEVELS TO CONTROL COSTS FOR THE

GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED HEALTH CARE SYSTEM. THIS INTERNATIONAL PATCHWORK OF PRICE

REGULATION HAS LED TO DIFFERENT PRICES AND SOME THIRD-PARTY TRADE IN OUR

PRODUCTS FROM MARKETS WITH LOWER PRICES. SUCH TRADE EXPLOITING PRICE

DIFFERENCES

14

TABLE OF CONTENTS

BETWEEN COUNTRIES CAN UNDERMINE OUR SALES IN MARKETS WITH HIGHER

PRICES.

AS A RESULT, IT IS EXPECTED THAT PRESSURES ON THE PRICING COMPONENT OF

OPERATING RESULTS WILL CONTINUE.

 COMPETITION FROM MANUFACTURERS OF GENERIC DRUGS IS A MAJOR CHALLENGE IN THE

U.S. AND IS GROWING INTERNATIONALLY. UPON THE EXPIRATION OR LOSS OF PATENT

PROTECTION FOR A PRODUCT, WE CAN LOSE THE MAJOR PORTION OF SALES OF THAT

PRODUCT IN A VERY SHORT PERIOD. THE U.S. BASIC PRODUCT PATENT COVERING

DIFLUCAN

EXPIRED IN JANUARY 2004. THE FDA HAS GRANTED US PEDIATRIC EXCLUSIVITY WITH

RESPECT TO

DIFLUCAN

, WHICH EXTENDS OUR MARKETING EXCLUSIVITY THROUGH JULY 29,

2004, BUT THE GRANT OF PEDIATRIC EXCLUSIVITY IS SUBJECT TO A PENDING LEGAL

CHALLENGE BY A GENERIC MANUFACTURER. THE PATENTS COVERING SEVERAL OF OUR OTHER

MEDICINES, INCLUDING

LIPITOR

,

NORVASC

,

NEURONTIN, CELEBREX

,

XALATAN

AND

DETROL

,

ARE BEING CHALLENGED BY GENERIC MANUFACTURERS.

 WE CANNOT PREDICT WITH ACCURACY THE TIMING OR IMPACT OF THE INTRODUCTION OF

COMPETITIVE PRODUCTS OR THEIR POSSIBLE EFFECT ON OUR SALES. PRODUCTS THAT

COMPETE WITH OUR DRUGS, INCLUDING SOME OF OUR BEST-SELLING MEDICINES, ARE

LAUNCHED FROM TIME TO TIME. LAUNCHES OF A NUMBER OF COMPETITIVE PRODUCTS HAVE

OCCURRED RECENTLY, AND CERTAIN POTENTIALLY COMPETITIVE PRODUCTS ARE IN VARIOUS

STAGES OF DEVELOPMENT, SOME OF WHICH HAVE BEEN FILED FOR APPROVAL WITH THE FDA

AND WITH REGULATORY AUTHORITIES IN OTHER COUNTRIES.

 WE RECORDED PRODUCT SALES OF MORE THAN $1 BILLION FOR EACH OF NINE

PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS IN 2003.

LIPITOR, NORVASC, ZOLOFT, NEURONTIN,

ZITHROMAX, CELEBREX, VIAGRA, ZYRTEC

AND

DIFLUCAN.

THOSE PRODUCTS ACCOUNTED FOR

61% OF OUR 2003 REVENUES. IN ADDITION,

XALATAN/XALCOM

ACHIEVED MORE THAN $1

BILLION IN ANNUAL SALES IN 2003 (INCLUDING 2003 SALES PRIOR TO OUR ACQUISITION

OF PHARMACIA IN APRIL). IF THESE OR ANY OF OUR OTHER MAJOR PRODUCTS WERE TO

BECOME SUBJECT TO A PROBLEM SUCH AS LOSS OF PATENT PROTECTION, MATERIAL PRODUCT

LIABILITY LITIGATION, UNEXPECTED SIDE EFFECTS, REGULATORY PROCEEDINGS,

PUBLICITY AFFECTING DOCTOR OR PATIENT CONFIDENCE OR PRESSURE FROM EXISTING

COMPETITIVE PRODUCTS, OR IF A NEW, MORE EFFECTIVE TREATMENT SHOULD BE

INTRODUCED, THE IMPACT ON OUR REVENUES COULD BE SIGNIFICANT. AS NOTED, PATENTS

COVERING SEVERAL OF OUR BEST-SELLING MEDICINES ARE THE SUBJECT OF PENDING LEGAL

CHALLENGES.

 THE DISCOVERY AND DEVELOPMENT OF NEW PRODUCTS AS WELL AS THE DEVELOPMENT OF

ADDITIONAL USES FOR EXISTING PRODUCTS IS VERY IMPORTANT TO THE SUCCESS OF THE

COMPANY. HOWEVER, BALANCING CURRENT GROWTH AND INVESTMENT FOR THE FUTURE

REMAINS A MAJOR CHALLENGE. OUR ONGOING INVESTMENTS IN NEW PRODUCT INTRODUCTIONS

AND IN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT FOR NEW PRODUCTS AND EXISTING PRODUCT

EXTENSIONS COULD EXCEED CORRESPONDING SALES GROWTH. THIS COULD PRODUCE HIGHER

COSTS WITHOUT A PROPORTIONAL INCREASE IN REVENUES.

 RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES PARTICULARLY APPLY WITH RESPECT TO PRODUCT-RELATED

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS. THE OUTCOME OF THE LENGTHY AND COMPLEX PROCESS OF

IDENTIFYING NEW COMPOUNDS AND DEVELOPING NEW PRODUCTS IS INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN.

THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE AS TO WHETHER OR WHEN WE WILL RECEIVE REGULATORY

APPROVAL FOR NEW PRODUCTS OR FOR NEW INDICATIONS OR DOSAGE FORMS FOR EXISTING

PRODUCTS. THERE ALSO ARE MANY CONSIDERATIONS THAT CAN AFFECT MARKETING OF

PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS AROUND THE WORLD. REGULATORY DELAYS, THE INABILITY TO

SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETE CLINICAL TRIALS, CLAIMS AND CONCERNS ABOUT SAFETY AND

EFFICACY, NEW DISCOVERIES, PATENT DISPUTES AND CLAIMS ABOUT ADVERSE SIDE

EFFECTS ARE A FEW OF THE FACTORS THAT COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE REALIZATION OF

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT AND PRODUCT-RELATED FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS.

 DECISIONS ABOUT RESEARCH STUDIES MADE EARLY IN THE DEVELOPMENT PROCESS OF A

DRUG CANDIDATE CAN HAVE A SUBSTANTIAL IMPACT ON THE MARKETING STRATEGY ONCE THE

DRUG RECEIVES APPROVAL. MORE DETAILED STUDIES MAY DEMONSTRATE ADDITIONAL

BENEFITS THAT CAN HELP IN THE MARKETING, BUT THEY CONSUME TIME AND RESOURCES

AND CAN DELAY SUBMITTING THE DRUG CANDIDATE FOR INITIAL APPROVAL. WE TRY TO

PLAN CLINICAL TRIALS PRUDENTLY, BUT THERE IS NO GUARANTEE THAT A PROPER BALANCE

OF SPEED AND TESTING WILL BE MADE IN EACH CASE. THE QUALITY OF OUR DECISIONS IN

THIS AREA COULD AFFECT OUR FUTURE RESULTS.

 40.6% OF OUR 2003 REVENUES DERIVED FROM INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS, INCLUDING

5.9% FROM JAPAN. THESE INTERNATIONAL-BASED REVENUES AS WELL AS OUR SUBSTANTIAL

INTERNATIONAL ASSETS EXPOSE OUR REVENUES AND EARNINGS TO FOREIGN CURRENCY

15

TABLE OF CONTENTS

EXCHANGE RATE CHANGES. IN ADDITION, OUR INTEREST-BEARING INVESTMENTS, LOANS AND

BORROWINGS ARE SUBJECT TO RISK FROM CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES. THESE RISKS AND

THE MEASURES WE HAVE TAKEN TO HELP CONTAIN THEM ARE DISCUSSED IN THE SECTION

ENTITLED

FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT

ON PAGES 19 AND 20 OF OUR 2003 FINANCIAL

REPORT. FOR ADDITIONAL DETAILS, SEE NOTE 5-D TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS,

DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES

, ON PAGES

35 THROUGH 37 OF OUR 2003 FINANCIAL REPORT. THOSE SECTIONS OF OUR 2003

FINANCIAL REPORT ARE INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE.

NOTWITHSTANDING OUR EFFORTS TO FORESEE AND MITIGATE THE EFFECTS OF CHANGES

IN FISCAL CIRCUMSTANCES, WE CANNOT PREDICT WITH CERTAINTY CHANGES IN CURRENCY

AND INTEREST RATES, INFLATION OR OTHER RELATED FACTORS AFFECTING OUR

BUSINESSES.

 OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS ALSO COULD BE AFFECTED BY CHANGES IN

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY LEGAL PROTECTIONS AND REMEDIES, TRADE REGULATIONS AND

PROCEDURES AND ACTIONS AFFECTING APPROVAL, PRODUCTION, PRICING, REIMBURSEMENT

AND MARKETING OF PRODUCTS, AS WELL AS BY UNSTABLE GOVERNMENTS AND LEGAL

SYSTEMS, INTER-GOVERNMENTAL DISPUTES AND POSSIBLE NATIONALIZATION.

 DIFFICULTIES OR DELAYS IN PRODUCT MANUFACTURING OR MARKETING, INCLUDING, BUT

NOT LIMITED TO, THE INABILITY TO INCREASE PRODUCTION CAPACITY COMMENSURATE WITH

DEMAND, OR THE FAILURE TO PREDICT MARKET DEMAND FOR, OR TO GAIN MARKET

ACCEPTANCE OF, APPROVED PRODUCTS, COULD AFFECT FUTURE RESULTS.

 GROWTH IN COSTS AND EXPENSES, CHANGES IN PRODUCT MIX AND THE IMPACT OF

ACQUISITIONS, DIVESTITURES, RESTRUCTURINGS, PRODUCT WITHDRAWALS AND OTHER

UNUSUAL EVENTS THAT COULD RESULT FROM EVOLVING BUSINESS STRATEGIES, EVALUATION

OF ASSET REALIZATION AND ORGANIZATIONAL RESTRUCTURING COULD AFFECT FUTURE

RESULTS. SUCH RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES INCLUDE, IN PARTICULAR, OUR ABILITY TO

INTEGRATE AND TO OBTAIN THE ANTICIPATED RESULTS AND SYNERGIES FROM OUR

ACQUISITION OF PHARMACIA.

 OUR FUTURE RESULTS COULD BE AFFECTED BY CHANGES IN LAWS AND REGULATIONS,

INCLUDING CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING STANDARDS, TAXATION REQUIREMENTS (INCLUDING

TAX-RATE CHANGES, NEW TAX LAWS AND REVISED TAX LAW INTERPRETATIONS),

COMPETITION LAWS AND ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS IN THE U.S. AND OTHER COUNTRIES.

 OUR FUTURE RESULTS COULD BE AFFECTED BY CHANGES IN BUSINESS, POLITICAL AND

ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, INCLUDING THE COST AND AVAILABILITY OF INSURANCE, DUE TO

THE THREAT OF FUTURE TERRORIST ACTIVITY IN THE U.S. AND OTHER PARTS OF THE

WORLD AND RELATED U.S. MILITARY ACTION OVERSEAS.

 WE AND CERTAIN OF OUR SUBSIDIARIES ARE INVOLVED IN VARIOUS PATENT, PRODUCT

LIABILITY, CONSUMER, COMMERCIAL, ENVIRONMENTAL, AND TAX LITIGATIONS AND CLAIMS;

GOVERNMENT INVESTIGATIONS; AND OTHER LEGAL PROCEEDINGS THAT ARISE FROM TIME TO

TIME IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF OUR BUSINESS. WE DO NOT BELIEVE ANY OF THEM WILL

HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL POSITION. LITIGATION IS

INHERENTLY UNPREDICTABLE, AND EXCESSIVE VERDICTS DO OCCUR. ALTHOUGH WE BELIEVE

WE HAVE VALID DEFENSES IN THESE MATTERS, WE COULD IN THE FUTURE INCUR JUDGMENTS

OR ENTER INTO SETTLEMENTS OF CLAIMS THAT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT

ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN ANY PARTICULAR PERIOD.

PATENT CLAIMS INCLUDE CHALLENGES TO THE COVERAGE AND/OR VALIDITY OF OUR

PATENTS ON VARIOUS PRODUCTS OR PROCESSES. ALTHOUGH WE BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE

VALID DEFENSES TO THESE CHALLENGES WITH RESPECT TO ALL OUR MATERIAL PATENTS,

THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE AS TO THE OUTCOME OF THESE MATTERS, AND A LOSS IN ANY

OF THESE CASES COULD RESULT IN A LOSS OF PATENT PROTECTION FOR THE DRUG AT

ISSUE, WHICH COULD LEAD TO A SIGNIFICANT LOSS OF SALES OF THAT DRUG AND COULD

MATERIALLY AFFECT FUTURE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

ITEM 2. PROPERTIES

OUR CORPORATE HEADQUARTERS AND THE HEADQUARTERS OF OUR PHARMACEUTICAL AND

ANIMAL HEALTH BUSINESSES ARE LOCATED AT OUR WORLD HEADQUARTERS, WHICH INCLUDES

SEVERAL BUILDINGS IN NEW YORK CITY. WE OWN THREE OF THE BUILDINGS, INCLUDING

OUR MAIN, 33-STORY OFFICE TOWER AT 235 EAST 42ND STREET, AND LEASE SPACE IN THE

OTHER BUILDINGS NEARBY. OUR 33-STORY OFFICE TOWER IS LOCATED ON A SITE WE LEASE

UNDER A LONG-TERM GROUND LEASE.

FOR OUR PHARMACEUTICAL BUSINESSES, WE OWN AND LEASE SPACE AROUND THE WORLD

FOR SALES AND MARKETING, ADMINISTRATIVE SUPPORT AND CUSTOMER SERVICE FUNCTIONS.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

OUR GLOBAL RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT DIVISION IS HEADQUARTERED IN NEW

LONDON, CONNECTICUT. WE HAVE MAJOR PHARMACEUTICAL RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

OPERATIONS IN OWNED FACILITIES IN AMBOISE, FRANCE; ANN ARBOR, KALAMAZOO AND

PORTAGE, MICHIGAN; CAMBRIDGE, MASSACHUSETTS; GROTON, CONNECTICUT; NAGOYA,

JAPAN; ST. LOUIS, MISSOURI; AND SANDWICH, ENGLAND, U.K. WE ALSO LEASE MAJOR

FACILITIES IN LA JOLLA, CALIFORNIA FOR PHARMACEUTICAL RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

OPERATIONS. AS WE ANNOUNCED SHORTLY AFTER THE ACQUISITION OF PHARMACIA IN APRIL

2003, WE HAVE CLOSED OR WILL CLOSE A NUMBER OF OTHER LEGACY PFIZER AND LEGACY

PHARMACIA PHARMACEUTICAL RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT OPERATIONS IN THE U.S. AND

VARIOUS OTHER COUNTRIES.

WE HAVE VETERINARY MEDICINE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT OPERATIONS IN OWNED

FACILITIES IN HENRIETTA AND RICHLAND TOWNSHIP, MICHIGAN; LINCOLN, NEBRASKA; AND

SANDWICH, ENGLAND, U.K.

THE HEADQUARTERS AND THE RESEARCH AND U.S. OPERATIONS OF OUR CONSUMER

HEALTHCARE BUSINESS ARE LOCATED IN MORRIS PLAINS, NEW JERSEY, WHERE WE OWN FIVE

BUILDINGS AND LEASE A SMALLER AMOUNT OF SPACE NEARBY. CONSUMER HEALTHCARES

SALES AND MARKETING OFFICES IN THE U.S. ARE LOCATED IN LEASED FACILITIES. IN

SWEDEN, THE UNITED KINGDOM AND THE UNITED STATES. THE GLOBAL MANUFACTURING

DIVISION ALSO OPERATES NUMEROUS DISTRIBUTION FACILITIES IN MAJOR MARKETS AROUND

THE WORLD.

IN GENERAL, OUR PROPERTIES ARE WELL MAINTAINED, ADEQUATE AND SUITABLE TO

THEIR PURPOSES. THE GROWTH OF OUR BUSINESSES, INCLUDING AS A RESULT OF THE

ACQUISITION OF PHARMACIA IN 2003, HAS CREATED SPACE PRESSURES FOR CERTAIN

OPERATIONS, HOWEVER. WE HAVE RESPONDED TO SUCH CHALLENGES WITH PLANS TO PROVIDE

APPROPRIATE FACILITIES AS NEEDS ARE DEMONSTRATED. AMONG OTHER STEPS, IN 2003 WE

PURCHASED AN ADDITIONAL BUILDING IN NEW YORK CITY TO ACCOMMODATE THE

REQUIREMENTS OF OUR WORLD HEADQUARTERS. NOTE 7 TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
