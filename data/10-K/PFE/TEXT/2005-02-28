CONSUMER HEALTHCARE CAN EXTEND THE LIFE OF SOME OF OUR PRESCRIPTION MEDICATIONS BY CONVERTING

THEM TO OTC MEDICATIONS. FOR EXAMPLE,

NICORETTE, BENADRYL, SUDAFED

AND

ZANTAC 75

WERE ALL

PREVIOUSLY PRESCRIPTION PRODUCTS AND ZANTAC 150 WAS LAUNCHED AS AN OTC MEDICINE IN JANUARY 2005. AS

MARKET CONDITIONS PERMIT, AND WHEN WE HAVE NECESSARY APPROVAL FROM DRUG REGULATORY AUTHORITIES, WE

PLAN TO PURSUE SIMILAR LAUNCHES FOR OTHER PRODUCTS.

ANIMAL HEALTH SEGMENT

OUR ANIMAL HEALTH BUSINESS IS THE LARGEST IN THE WORLD. WE DISCOVER, DEVELOP AND SELL

PRODUCTS FOR THE PREVENTION AND TREATMENT OF DISEASES IN LIVESTOCK AND COMPANION ANIMALS. IN 2004,

ANIMAL HEALTH REVENUES INCREASED 22%, TO $2.0 BILLION, DUE TO STRONG PERFORMANCES BY KEY IN-LINE

BRANDS, SIGNIFICANT PRODUCT LAUNCHES INCLUDING

DRAXXIN

AND

EXCEDE

FOR RESPIRATORY DISEASE IN CATTLE

AND SWINE, STRONG GROWTH IN SALES OF

RIMADYL, REVOLUTION

AND

CLAVAMOX

FOR COMPANION ANIMALS, THE

FAVORABLE IMPACT OF FOREIGN EXCHANGE AND THE INCLUSION OF PHARMACIA PRODUCT REVENUES FOR A FULL

YEAR. REVENUES FROM THIS SEGMENT CONTRIBUTED 3.7% OF OUR TOTAL REVENUES IN 2004, 3.6% OF TOTAL

REVENUES IN 2003 AND 3.5% OF TOTAL REVENUES IN 2002.

AMONG THE PRODUCTS WE MARKET ARE PARASITICIDES, ANTI-INFLAMMATORIES, VACCINES, ANTIBIOTICS AND

RELATED MEDICINES, INCLUDING THE PRODUCTS DISCUSSED BELOW.

PARASITICIDES CONSTITUTE THE LARGEST SEGMENT OF THE ANIMAL HEALTH MARKET FOR COMPANION

ANIMALS, CONSISTING MAINLY OF MEDICINES FOR THE CONTROL OF PARASITES SUCH AS FLEAS AND HEARTWORM.

OUR PRODUCT,

REVOLUTION

, IS OUR LARGEST-SELLING PARASITICIDE FOR COMPANION ANIMALS.

RIMADYL

RELIEVES PAIN AND INFLAMMATION ASSOCIATED WITH CANINE OSTEOARTHRITIS AND SOFT TISSUE

ORTHOPEDIC SURGERY.

RIMADYL

IS THE ONLY ARTHRITIS PAIN MEDICATION PRESCRIBED BY VETERINARIANS

AVAILABLE IN CHEWABLE TABLETS, REGULAR CAPLETS AND IN AN INJECTABLE FORMULATION.

CLAVAMOX/SYNULOX

IS AN ANTIBIOTIC FOR SKIN AND SOFT TISSUE INFECTIONS IN DOGS AND CATS.

OUR VACCINE PORTFOLIO FOR LIVESTOCK IS EXTENSIVE AND INCLUDES

RESPISUREONE/

STELLAMUNEONE,

A SINGLE-DOSE VACCINE USED TO PREVENT PNEUMONIA IN SWINE, AND

BOVI-SHIELD GOLD,

A CATTLE VACCINE FOR REPRODUCTIVE AND RESPIRATORY PROTECTION.

DECTOMAX

INJECTABLE AND POUR-ON FORMULATIONS REMOVE AND CONTROL INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL

PARASITES IN BEEF CATTLE.

NAXCEL/EXCENEL RTU

IS AN ANTIBIOTIC USED TO TREAT RESPIRATORY AND INTERNAL INFECTIONS IN

CATTLE AND SWINE.

RESEARCH AND PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT

INNOVATION BY OUR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT OPERATIONS IS VERY IMPORTANT TO THE COMPANYS

SUCCESS. OUR GOAL IS TO DISCOVER, DEVELOP AND BRING TO MARKET INNOVATIVE PRODUCTS THAT ADDRESS

MAJOR UNMET MEDICAL NEEDS. THIS GOAL HAS BEEN SUPPORTED BY OUR SUBSTANTIAL RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

INVESTMENTS. WE SPENT $7.7 BILLION IN 2004, $7.5 BILLION IN 2003 AND $5.2 BILLION IN 2002 ON

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT.

WE CONDUCT RESEARCH INTERNALLY AND ALSO THROUGH CONTRACTS WITH THIRD PARTIES, THROUGH

COLLABORATIONS WITH UNIVERSITIES AND BIOTECHNOLOGY COMPANIES AND IN COOPERATION WITH OTHER

PHARMACEUTICAL FIRMS. WE ALSO SEEK OUT INNOVATIVE TECHNOLOGIES DEVELOPED BY THIRD PARTIES TO

INCORPORATE INTO OUR DISCOVERY OR DEVELOPMENT PROCESSES OR PROJECTS, AS WELL AS OUR PRODUCT LINES,

THROUGH ACQUISITION, LICENSING OR OTHER ARRANGEMENTS.

DRUG DISCOVERY AND DEVELOPMENT IS TIME CONSUMING, EXPENSIVE AND UNPREDICTABLE. ON AVERAGE,

ONLY ONE OUT OF MANY THOUSANDS OF CHEMICAL COMPOUNDS DISCOVERED BY RESEARCHERS

6

TABLE OF CONTENTS

PROVES TO BE BOTH

MEDICALLY EFFECTIVE AND SAFE ENOUGH TO BECOME AN APPROVED MEDICINE. THE PROCESS FROM EARLY

DISCOVERY TO DEVELOPMENT TO REGULATORY APPROVAL CAN TAKE MORE THAN TEN YEARS. DRUG CANDIDATES CAN

FAIL AT ANY STAGE OF THE PROCESS. CANDIDATES MAY NOT RECEIVE REGULATORY APPROVAL EVEN AFTER MANY

YEARS OF RESEARCH.

WE BELIEVE THAT OUR INVESTMENTS IN RESEARCH HAVE BEEN REWARDED BY THE NUMBER OF PHARMACEUTICAL

COMPOUNDS WE HAVE IN ALL STAGES OF DEVELOPMENT. WE CURRENTLY ARE

WORKING ON APPROXIMATELY 225

PROJECTS IN DEVELOPMENT, INCLUDING APPROXIMATELY 145 NEW MOLECULAR

ENTITIES AND 80 PRODUCT-LINE

EXTENSIONS. IN ADDITION, WE HAVE MORE THAN 400 PROJECTS IN DISCOVERY RESEARCH. IN RECENT YEARS, OUR

DISCOVERY SCIENTISTS HAVE DELIVERED DOZENS OF NEW CHEMICAL COMPOUNDS TO EARLY DEVELOPMENT. WHILE

THESE NEW CANDIDATES MAY OR MAY NOT EVENTUALLY RECEIVE REGULATORY APPROVAL, NEW DRUG CANDIDATES

ENTERING DEVELOPMENT ARE THE FOUNDATION FOR FUTURE PRODUCTS.

IN ADDITION TO DISCOVERING AND DEVELOPING NEW PRODUCTS, OUR RESEARCH OPERATIONS ADD VALUE TO

OUR EXISTING PRODUCTS BY IMPROVING THEIR EFFECTIVENESS AND BY DISCOVERING NEW USES FOR THEM. IN

2004, FOR EXAMPLE, THE FDA APPROVED THE ADDITIONAL USE OF

GEODON

FOR THE TREATMENT OF ACUTE MANIA

IN BIPOLAR DISORDER.

INFORMATION CONCERNING SEVERAL OF OUR DRUG CANDIDATES IN DEVELOPMENT AS WELL AS SUPPLEMENTAL

FILINGS FOR EXISTING PRODUCTS IS SET FORTH UNDER THE HEADING

PRODUCT DEVELOPMENTS

IN OUR 2004

FINANCIAL REPORT. THAT INFORMATION IS INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE.

OUR COMPETITORS ALSO DEVOTE SUBSTANTIAL FUNDS AND RESOURCES TO RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT. IN

ADDITION, THE CONSOLIDATION THAT HAS OCCURRED IN OUR INDUSTRY HAS CREATED COMPANIES WITH

SUBSTANTIAL RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT RESOURCES. WE ALSO COMPETE AGAINST NUMEROUS SMALL

BIOTECHNOLOGY COMPANIES IN DEVELOPING POTENTIAL DRUG CANDIDATES. THE EXTENT TO WHICH OUR

COMPETITORS ARE SUCCESSFUL IN THEIR RESEARCH COULD RESULT IN EROSION OF THE SALES OF OUR PRODUCTS

AND UNANTICIPATED PRODUCT OBSOLESCENCE.

INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS

WE HAVE SIGNIFICANT OPERATIONS OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES. THEY ARE MANAGED THROUGH THE

SAME BUSINESS SEGMENTS AS OUR U.S. OPERATIONS  HUMAN HEALTH, CONSUMER HEALTHCARE AND ANIMAL

HEALTH.

REVENUES FROM OPERATIONS OUTSIDE THE U.S. OF $23 BILLION ACCOUNTED FOR 44% OF OUR TOTAL

REVENUES IN 2004. REVENUES EXCEEDED $500 MILLION IN EACH OF TEN COUNTRIES OUTSIDE THE U.S. IN 2004.

THE U.S. WAS THE ONLY COUNTRY TO CONTRIBUTE MORE THAN 10% OF OUR TOTAL REVENUES, COMPRISING 56% OF

REVENUES IN 2004, 60% OF OUR REVENUES IN 2003 AND 64% OF OUR REVENUES IN 2002. JAPAN IS OUR

SECOND-LARGEST NATIONAL MARKET, WITH 6% OF OUR REVENUES IN EACH OF 2004, 2003 AND 2002.

OUR INTERNATIONAL BUSINESSES ARE SUBJECT, IN VARYING DEGREES, TO A NUMBER OF RISKS INHERENT IN

CARRYING ON BUSINESS IN OTHER COUNTRIES. THESE INCLUDE CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS, CAPITAL AND EXCHANGE

CONTROL REGULATIONS, EXPROPRIATION AND OTHER RESTRICTIVE GOVERNMENT ACTIONS. OUR INTERNATIONAL

BUSINESSES ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO GOVERNMENT-IMPOSED CONSTRAINTS, INCLUDING LAWS ON PRICING OR

REIMBURSEMENT FOR USE OF PRODUCTS. SEE

GOVERNMENT REGULATION AND PRICE CONSTRAINTS

BELOW FOR

DISCUSSION OF THESE MATTERS.

DEPENDING ON THE DIRECTION OF CHANGE RELATIVE TO THE U.S. DOLLAR, FOREIGN CURRENCY VALUES CAN

INCREASE OR DECREASE THE REPORTED DOLLAR VALUE OF OUR NET ASSETS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. IN

2004, REVENUES WERE FAVORABLY IMPACTED BY FOREIGN EXCHANGE, AS FOREIGN CURRENCY MOVEMENTS RELATIVE

TO THE U.S. DOLLAR INCREASED OUR REPORTED REVENUES IN MANY COUNTRIES. WHILE WE CANNOT PREDICT

WITH CERTAINTY FUTURE CHANGES IN FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES OR THE EFFECT THEY WILL HAVE ON US, WE

ATTEMPT TO MITIGATE THEIR IMPACT THROUGH OPERATIONAL MEANS AND BY USING VARIOUS FINANCIAL

INSTRUMENTS. SEE THE DISCUSSION UNDER NOTE 8-D TO OUR CONSOLIDATED

MARKETING

IN OUR GLOBAL HUMAN HEALTH BUSINESS, WE PROMOTE OUR PRODUCTS TO HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS

SUCH AS DOCTORS, NURSE PRACTITIONERS, PHYSICIAN ASSISTANTS, PHARMACISTS, HOSPITALS, PHARMACY

BENEFIT MANAGERS (PBMS), MANAGED CARE ORGANIZATIONS (MCOS) AND GOVERNMENT AGENCIES. THROUGH OUR

MARKETING ORGANIZATIONS, WE EXPLAIN THE APPROVED USES AND ADVANTAGES OF OUR PRODUCTS TO HEALTHCARE

PROVIDERS. WE ALSO MARKET DIRECTLY TO CONSUMERS IN THE U.S. THROUGH DIRECT-TO-CONSUMER PRINT AND

TELEVISION ADVERTISING. IN ADDITION, WE SPONSOR GENERAL ADVERTISING TO EDUCATE THE PUBLIC ABOUT OUR

INNOVATIVE MEDICAL RESEARCH.

OUR OPERATIONS INCLUDE SEVERAL PHARMACEUTICAL SALES ORGANIZATIONS. EACH SALES ORGANIZATION

MARKETS A DISTINCT GROUP OF PRODUCTS. OUR PRESCRIPTION PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS ARE SOLD PRINCIPALLY

TO WHOLESALERS, BUT WE ALSO SELL DIRECTLY TO RETAILERS, HOSPITALS, CLINICS, GOVERNMENT AGENCIES AND

PHARMACIES.

WE SEEK TO GAIN ACCESS TO HEALTH AUTHORITY, PBM AND MCO FORMULARIES (LISTS OF RECOMMENDED OR

APPROVED MEDICINES AND OTHER PRODUCTS) AND REIMBURSEMENT LISTS BY DEMONSTRATING THE QUALITIES AND

TREATMENT BENEFITS OF OUR PRODUCTS. WE ALSO WORK WITH MCOS AND PBMS AND OTHER APPROPRIATE

HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS TO ASSIST THEM WITH DISEASE MANAGEMENT, PATIENT EDUCATION AND OTHER TOOLS THAT

HELP THEIR MEDICAL TREATMENT ROUTINES. FOR EXAMPLE, WE SPONSOR A PROGRAM OFFERED BY THE STATE OF

FLORIDA AGENCY FOR HEALTH CARE ADMINISTRATION THAT IS DESIGNED TO HELP MANAGE CHRONIC DISEASES

AMONG FLORIDAS MEDICAID POPULATION.

OUR CONSUMER HEALTHCARE BUSINESS PRIMARILY USES ITS OWN REPRESENTATIVES TO DIRECTLY PROMOTE

ITS PRODUCTS, INCLUDING MARKETING CERTAIN PRODUCTS DIRECTLY TO PROFESSIONALS USING A PROFESSIONAL

DETAIL FORCE. WE ALSO USE PRINT AND TELEVISION CONSUMER ADVERTISING AND OFFER SALES INCENTIVES SUCH

AS COUPONS. OUR CONSUMER PRODUCTS ARE SOLD THROUGH VARIOUS RETAILERS.

OUR ANIMAL HEALTH BUSINESS ALSO USES ITS OWN SALES ORGANIZATION TO PROMOTE ITS PRODUCTS. ITS

ADVERTISING AND PROMOTION ARE GENERALLY TARGETED TO HEALTH PROFESSIONALS, DIRECTLY AND THROUGH

VETERINARY JOURNALS. ANIMAL HEALTH AND NUTRITION PRODUCTS ARE SOLD THROUGH VETERINARIANS, DRUG

WHOLESALERS, DISTRIBUTORS AND RETAIL OUTLETS AS WELL AS DIRECTLY TO USERS. WHERE APPROPRIATE, THESE

PRODUCTS ARE ALSO MARKETED THROUGH PRINT AND TELEVISION ADVERTISING.

DURING 2004, SALES TO OUR THREE LARGEST CUSTOMERS WERE AS FOLLOWS.



MCKESSON, INC.  18.2% OF OUR TOTAL REVENUES;



CARDINAL HEALTH, INC.  13.8% OF OUR TOTAL REVENUES; AND



AMERISOURCEBERGEN CORPORATION  12.6% OF OUR TOTAL REVENUES.

SALES TO THESE WHOLESALERS WERE CONCENTRATED IN THE HUMAN HEALTH SEGMENT. APART FROM THESE

INSTANCES, NONE OF OUR BUSINESS SEGMENTS IS DEPENDENT ON ANY ONE CUSTOMER OR GROUP OF RELATED

CUSTOMERS.

PATENTS AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS

OUR PRODUCTS ARE SOLD AROUND THE WORLD UNDER BRAND-NAME, LOGO AND CERTAIN PRODUCT DESIGN

TRADEMARKS THAT WE CONSIDER IN THE AGGREGATE TO BE OF MATERIAL IMPORTANCE. TRADEMARK PROTECTION

CONTINUES IN SOME COUNTRIES FOR AS LONG AS THE MARK IS USED AND, IN OTHER COUNTRIES, FOR AS LONG AS

IT IS REGISTERED. REGISTRATIONS GENERALLY ARE FOR FIXED, BUT RENEWABLE, TERMS.

WE OWN OR LICENSE A NUMBER OF U.S. AND FOREIGN PATENTS. THESE PATENTS COVER PHARMACEUTICAL AND

OTHER PRODUCTS AND THEIR USES; PHARMACEUTICAL FORMULATIONS; PRODUCT MANUFACTURING PROCESSES; AND

INTERMEDIATE CHEMICAL COMPOUNDS USED IN MANUFACTURING.

PATENTS FOR INDIVIDUAL PRODUCTS EXTEND FOR VARYING PERIODS ACCORDING TO THE DATE OF PATENT

FILING OR GRANT AND THE LEGAL TERM OF PATENTS IN THE VARIOUS COUNTRIES WHERE PATENT PROTECTION IS

OBTAINED. THE ACTUAL PROTECTION AFFORDED BY A PATENT, WHICH CAN VARY FROM COUNTRY TO COUNTRY,

DEPENDS UPON THE TYPE OF PATENT, THE SCOPE OF ITS

8

TABLE OF CONTENTS

COVERAGE AND THE AVAILABILITY OF LEGAL REMEDIES

IN THE COUNTRY.

IN THE AGGREGATE, OUR PATENT AND RELATED RIGHTS ARE OF MATERIAL IMPORTANCE TO OUR BUSINESSES

IN THE U.S. AND MOST OTHER COUNTRIES. BASED ON CURRENT PRODUCT SALES, AND CONSIDERING THE VIGOROUS

COMPETITION WITH PRODUCTS SOLD BY OTHERS, THE PATENT RIGHTS WE CONSIDER SIGNIFICANT IN RELATION TO

OUR BUSINESS AS A WHOLE, TOGETHER WITH THE YEAR IN WHICH THE U.S. BASIC PRODUCT PATENT EXPIRES

(INCLUDING, WHERE APPLICABLE, THE ADDITIONAL SIX-MONTH PEDIATRIC EXCLUSIVITY PERIOD), ARE THOSE FOR

THE FOLLOWING DRUGS.

IN SOME INSTANCES, THERE ARE LATER-EXPIRING PATENTS RELATING TO OUR PRODUCTS DIRECTED TO

PARTICULAR FORMS OR COMPOSITIONS OF THE DRUG OR TO METHODS OF

MANUFACTURING OR USING THE DRUG IN

THE TREATMENT OF FURTHER DISEASES OR CONDITIONS. HOWEVER, SUCH PATENTS MAY NOT PROTECT THE

COMPANYS DRUG FROM GENERIC DRUG COMPETITION AFTER THE EXPIRATION OF THE BASIC PRODUCT PATENT.

ZITHROMAX

IS PATENTED BY PLIVA, A CROATIAN PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANY. THE DRUG IS LICENSED

EXCLUSIVELY TO US BY PLIVA FOR SALES AND MARKETING IN MAJOR COUNTRIES, AND WE PURCHASE THE COMPOUND

IN BULK CRUDE FORM FROM PLIVA. ALTHOUGH ZITHROMAX HAS EXPERIENCED PATENT EXPIRATIONS IN CERTAIN

COUNTRIES, IT RETAINS BASIC PATENT PROTECTION IN THE U.S. UNTIL NOVEMBER 2005.

ZYRTEC

IS PATENTED BY THE BELGIAN COMPANY UCB S.A. AND IS LICENSED TO US FOR SALES IN THE

U.S., CANADA, EUROPE, AUSTRALIA AND SOUTH AFRICA. WE COPROMOTE

ZYRTEC

AS A PRESCRIPTION MEDICINE IN

THE U.S. WITH A SUBSIDIARY OF UCB S.A. AND HAVE A LICENSE TO SELL

ZYRTEC

UNDER VARIOUS TRADE NAMES

AS AN OTC MEDICINE IN THE OTHER MARKETS.

ARICEPT

IS PATENTED BY EISAI CO., LTD. WE COPROMOTE

ARICEPT

WITH EISAI IN THE U.S. AND SEVERAL

OTHER COUNTRIES AND HAVE AN EXCLUSIVE LICENSE TO SELL THE DRUG IN CERTAIN OTHER COUNTRIES.

XALATAN

IS NOT PROTECTED BY A BASIC PRODUCT PATENT. HOWEVER, WE HAVE BROADLY PATENTED

OPHTHALMIC FORMULATIONS CONTAINING LANTANOPROST UNTIL 2011.

GENOTROPIN

IS PATENTED BY NOVO NORDISK, WHICH HAS GRANTED US A NON-EXCLUSIVE LICENSE TO SELL

THE DRUG IN THE U.S.

THE U.S. BASIC PRODUCT PATENT RELATING TO

NEURONTIN

EXPIRED IN 1994. HOWEVER, IN APRIL 2000, A

U.S. PATENT WAS GRANTED RELATING TO STABLE PHARMACEUTICAL COMPOSITIONS OF

NEURONTIN

CONTAINING LOW

LEVELS OF LACTAM IMPURITY. THIS PATENT EXPIRES IN 2017. HOWEVER,

NEURONTIN

NOW FACES COMPETITION

FROM GENERIC VERSIONS OF THE PRODUCT LAUNCHED AT-RISK (BEFORE THE FINAL RESOLUTION OF LEGAL

PROCEEDINGS CHALLENGING THE GENERIC VERSIONS) BY GENERIC DRUG MANUFACTURERS DURING THE LATTER HALF

OF 2004. THE PATENT INFRINGEMENT LITIGATIONS RELATED TO THIS PRODUCT CONTINUE. FOLLOWING THE

LAUNCHES OF THESE GENERIC VERSIONS, IN OCTOBER, WE LAUNCHED OUR OWN GENERIC VERSION OF THE PRODUCT

THROUGH OUR GREENSTONE LTD. SUBSIDIARY.

OTHER COMPANIES HAVE FILED APPLICATIONS WITH THE FDA SEEKING APPROVAL OF PRODUCTS THAT WE ALSO

BELIEVE INFRINGE OUR PATENTS COVERING, AMONG OTHER PRODUCTS,

LIPITOR, NORVASC

,

CELEBREX, XALATAN

AND

DETROL.

WE ALSO HAVE OTHER PATENT RIGHTS COVERING ADDITIONAL PRODUCTS THAT HAVE LESSER REVENUES.

THE EXPIRATION OF A BASIC PRODUCT PATENT OR LOSS OF PATENT PROTECTION RESULTING FROM A LEGAL

CHALLENGE NORMALLY RESULTS IN SIGNIFICANT COMPETITION FROM GENERIC PRODUCTS AGAINST THE ORIGINALLY

PATENTED PRODUCT AND CAN RESULT IN A

SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN SALES OF THAT PRODUCT IN A VERY SHORT PERIOD. IN SOME CASES, HOWEVER,

WE CAN CONTINUE TO OBTAIN COMMERCIAL BENEFITS FROM PRODUCT MANUFACTURING TRADE SECRETS; PATENTS ON

USES FOR PRODUCTS; PATENTS ON PROCESSES AND INTERMEDIATES FOR THE ECONOMICAL MANUFACTURE OF THE

ACTIVE INGREDIENTS; PATENTS FOR SPECIAL

9

TABLE OF CONTENTS

FORMULATIONS OF THE PRODUCT OR DELIVERY MECHANISMS; AND

CONVERSION OF THE ACTIVE INGREDIENT TO OTC PRODUCTS.

ONE OF THE MAIN LIMITATIONS ON OUR OPERATIONS IN SOME COUNTRIES OUTSIDE THE U.S. IS THE LACK

OF EFFECTIVE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY PROTECTION OF OUR PRODUCTS. UNDER INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS IN

RECENT YEARS, GLOBAL PROTECTION OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS IS IMPROVING. THE GENERAL AGREEMENT

ON TARIFFS AND TRADE REQUIRES PARTICIPANT COUNTRIES TO AMEND THEIR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY LAWS TO

PROVIDE PATENT PROTECTION FOR PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS BY THE END OF A TEN-YEAR TRANSITION PERIOD. A

NUMBER OF COUNTRIES ARE DOING THIS. WE HAVE EXPERIENCED SIGNIFICANT GROWTH IN OUR BUSINESSES IN

SOME OF THOSE NATIONS, AND OUR CONTINUED BUSINESS EXPANSION IN THOSE COUNTRIES DEPENDS TO A LARGE

DEGREE ON FURTHER PATENT PROTECTION IMPROVEMENT.

COMPETITION

COMPETITION IS INTENSE IN ALL OF OUR BUSINESSES AND INCLUDES MANY LARGE AND SMALL

COMPETITORS. THE PRINCIPAL MEANS OF COMPETITION VARY AMONG PRODUCT CATEGORIES AND BUSINESS GROUPS.

HOWEVER, THE EFFICACY, SAFETY, PATIENTS AND CUSTOMERS EASE OF USE AND COST EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR

PRODUCTS ARE IMPORTANT FACTORS FOR SUCCESS IN ALL OF OUR PRINCIPAL BUSINESSES.

OUR HUMAN PHARMACEUTICAL BUSINESS IS THE LARGEST IN THE WORLD. WE COMPETE WITH OTHER WORLDWIDE

RESEARCH-BASED DRUG COMPANIES, MANY SMALLER RESEARCH COMPANIES WITH MORE LIMITED THERAPEUTIC FOCUS

AND GENERIC DRUG MANUFACTURERS. OTHER COMPANIES MANUFACTURE AND SELL PRODUCTS THAT TREAT SIMILAR

DISEASES OR INDICATIONS AS OUR MAJOR PRODUCTS.

WE FOCUS ON UNMET MEDICAL NEEDS AND THERAPEUTIC IMPROVEMENTS. OUR EMPHASIS ON INNOVATION HAS

LED TO OUR MULTI-BILLION-DOLLAR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT INVESTMENTS OVER THE PAST DECADE.

IN RECENT YEARS, A COMPARISON OF THE TOTAL COST OF MEDICAL TREATMENTS USING PHARMACEUTICALS

VERSUS ALTERNATIVE TREATMENTS FOR THE SAME CONDITION HAS BECOME AN IMPORTANT BASIS OF COMPETITION.

MCOS AND PBMS LOOK TO COST ADVANTAGES AS WELL AS MEDICAL BENEFITS IN MAKING THEIR DRUG FORMULARY

DECISIONS.

OUR PHARMACEUTICAL SALES AND MARKETING ORGANIZATION IS A VALUABLE COMPETITIVE ASSET. OUR

SALESPEOPLES ABILITY TO REACH MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS WITH INFORMATION ABOUT OUR PRODUCTS HELPS US

RESPOND TO COMPETITIVE EFFORTS AND LAUNCH NEW PRODUCTS.

OUR CONSUMER HEALTHCARE BUSINESS IS ONE OF THE LARGEST IN THE WORLD. HOWEVER, MANY OTHER

COMPANIES, LARGE AND SMALL, MANUFACTURE AND SELL ONE OR MORE PRODUCTS THAT ARE SIMILAR TO OUR

CONSUMER HEALTHCARE PRODUCTS, INCLUDING MAJOR RETAIL CUSTOMERS THAT SELL PRIVATE LABEL OR HOUSE

BRANDS. SOURCES OF COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE INCLUDE PRODUCT QUALITY AND

EFFICACY, INCLUDING DIFFERENTIATED

CLAIMS, BRAND IDENTITY, ADVERTISING AND PROMOTION, PRODUCT INNOVATION, BROAD DISTRIBUTION

CAPABILITIES AND PRICE. SIGNIFICANT EXPENDITURES FOR ADVERTISING, PROMOTION AND MARKETING ARE

GENERALLY REQUIRED TO ACHIEVE AND MAINTAIN BOTH CONSUMER AND TRADE ACCEPTANCE OF CONSUMER PRODUCTS.

WHILE OUR ANIMAL HEALTH BUSINESS IS THE LARGEST IN THE WORLD, MANY OTHER COMPANIES OFFER

COMPETITIVE PRODUCTS. ALTOGETHER, THERE ARE HUNDREDS OF PRODUCERS OF ANIMAL HEALTH PRODUCTS

THROUGHOUT THE WORLD. THE PRINCIPAL METHODS OF COMPETITION VARY SOMEWHAT DEPENDING ON THE

PARTICULAR PRODUCT. THEY INCLUDE PRODUCT INNOVATION, QUALITY, SERVICE, EFFECTIVE PROMOTION TO

VETERINARY PROFESSIONALS AND CONSUMERS AND PRICE.

MANAGED CARE ORGANIZATIONS

THE GROWTH OF MCOS IN THE U.S. HAS BEEN A MAJOR FACTOR IN THE COMPETITIVE MAKE-UP OF THE

HEALTH CARE MARKETPLACE. A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF THE U.S. POPULATION NOW PARTICIPATES IN SOME

VERSION OF MANAGED CARE. BECAUSE OF THE SIZE OF THE PATIENT POPULATION COVERED BY MCOS, MARKETING

OF PRESCRIPTION DRUGS TO THEM AND THE PBMS THAT SERVE MANY OF THOSE ORGANIZATIONS HAS BECOME

IMPORTANT TO OUR BUSINESS.

MCOS CAN INCLUDE MEDICAL INSURANCE COMPANIES, MEDICAL PLAN ADMINISTRATORS, HEALTH-

MAINTENANCE ORGANIZATIONS, ALLIANCES OF HOSPITALS AND PHYSICIANS AND OTHER PHYSICIAN

ORGANIZATIONS. THE PURCHASING POWER OF MCOS HAS BEEN INCREASING IN RECENT YEARS DUE TO THEIR

GROWING NUMBERS OF ENROLLED PATIENTS. AT THE SAME TIME, THOSE ORGANIZATIONS HAVE BEEN CONSOLIDATING

INTO FEWER, EVEN LARGER ENTITIES. THIS ENHANCES THEIR PURCHASING STRENGTH AND IMPORTANCE TO US.

10

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE GROWTH OF MCOS HAS INCREASED PRESSURE ON DRUG PRICES. A MAJOR OBJECTIVE OF MCOS IS TO

CONTAIN AND, WHERE POSSIBLE, REDUCE HEALTH CARE EXPENDITURES. THEY TYPICALLY USE FORMULARIES,

VOLUME PURCHASES AND LONG-TERM CONTRACTS TO NEGOTIATE DISCOUNTS FROM PHARMACEUTICAL PROVIDERS. THEY

USE THEIR PURCHASING POWER TO BARGAIN FOR LOWER SUPPLIER PRICES. THEY ALSO EMPHASIZE PRIMARY AND

PREVENTIVE CARE, OUT-PATIENT TREATMENT AND PROCEDURES PERFORMED AT DOCTORS OFFICES AND CLINICS.

HOSPITALIZATION AND SURGERY, TYPICALLY THE MOST EXPENSIVE FORMS OF TREATMENT, ARE CAREFULLY

MANAGED. SINCE THE USE OF CERTAIN DRUGS CAN PREVENT THE NEED FOR HOSPITALIZATION, PROFESSIONAL

THERAPY OR EVEN SURGERY, SUCH DRUGS CAN BECOME FAVORED FIRST-LINE TREATMENTS FOR CERTAIN DISEASES.

AS DISCUSSED ABOVE IN

MARKETING

, MCOS AND PBMS TYPICALLY DEVELOP FORMULARIES TO REDUCE THEIR

COST FOR MEDICATIONS. FORMULARIES CAN BE BASED ON THE PRICES AND THERAPEUTIC BENEFITS OF THE

AVAILABLE PRODUCTS. DUE TO THEIR GENERALLY LOWER COST, GENERIC MEDICINES ARE OFTEN FAVORED. THE

BREADTH OF THE PRODUCTS COVERED BY FORMULARIES CAN VARY CONSIDERABLY FROM ONE MCO TO ANOTHER AND

MANY FORMULARIES INCLUDE ALTERNATIVE AND COMPETITIVE PRODUCTS FOR TREATMENT OF PARTICULAR MEDICAL

PROBLEMS. MCOS USE A VARIETY OF MEANS TO ENCOURAGE PATIENTS USE OF PRODUCTS LISTED ON THEIR

FORMULARIES.

EXCLUSION OF A PRODUCT FROM A FORMULARY CAN LEAD TO ITS SHARPLY REDUCED USAGE IN THE MCO

PATIENT POPULATION. CONSEQUENTLY, PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES COMPETE AGGRESSIVELY TO HAVE THEIR

PRODUCTS INCLUDED. WHERE POSSIBLE, COMPANIES COMPETE FOR INCLUSION BASED UPON UNIQUE FEATURES OF

THEIR PRODUCTS, SUCH AS GREATER EFFICACY, BETTER PATIENT EASE OF USE OR FEWER SIDE EFFECTS. A LOWER

OVERALL COST OF THERAPY IS ALSO AN IMPORTANT FACTOR. PRODUCTS THAT DEMONSTRATE FEWER THERAPEUTIC

ADVANTAGES MUST COMPETE FOR INCLUSION BASED PRIMARILY ON PRICE. WE HAVE BEEN GENERALLY, ALTHOUGH

NOT UNIVERSALLY, SUCCESSFUL IN HAVING OUR MAJOR PRODUCTS INCLUDED ON MCO FORMULARIES.

THE IMPACT OF MCOS ON DRUG PRICES AND VOLUMES MAY INCREASE AS THE RESULT OF THEIR ROLE IN

NEGOTIATING ON BEHALF OF MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES IN CONNECTION WITH THE LIMITED OUT-PATIENT DRUG

BENEFIT UNDER MEDICARE, AS DISCUSSED BELOW UNDER

GOVERNMENT REGULATION AND PRICE CONSTRAINTS.

ANOTHER WAY WE ADDRESS THE INTERESTS OF MCOS IS BY DEVELOPING DISEASE-MANAGEMENT PROGRAMS.

THESE PROGRAMS CAN BE ATTRACTIVE TO MCOS BY IMPROVING PATIENT COMMUNICATIONS AND COMPLIANCE WITH

DOSAGE DIRECTIONS, WHICH ARE IMPORTANT FOR EFFECTIVE DISEASE TREATMENT. THEY CAN HELP MCOS ADDRESS

VARIOUS ASPECTS OF DISEASE MANAGEMENT, SUCH AS PREVENTION, DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENT OF CERTAIN

DISEASES, INCLUDING USE OF PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS. THIS COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH CAN IMPROVE THE

QUALITY OF CARE AND LOWER COSTLY COMPLICATIONS OF CHRONIC DISEASES. AS NOTED ABOVE IN

MARKETING

,

ONE SUCH PROGRAM, WHICH IS SPONSORED BY US AND OFFERED BY THE STATE OF FLORIDA AGENCY FOR HEALTH

CARE ADMINISTRATION, IS DESIGNED TO HELP MANAGE CHRONIC DISEASES AMONG FLORIDAS MEDICAID

POPULATION.

GENERIC PRODUCTS

ONE OF THE BIGGEST COMPETITIVE CHALLENGES THAT WE FACE IN THE U.S. AND THAT IS GROWING

INTERNATIONALLY IS FROM GENERIC PHARMACEUTICAL MANUFACTURERS. UPON THE EXPIRATION OR LOSS OF PATENT

PROTECTION FOR A PRODUCT, WE CAN LOSE THE MAJOR PORTION OF SALES OF THAT PRODUCT IN A VERY SHORT

PERIOD. GENERIC COMPETITORS OPERATE WITHOUT OUR LARGE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES AND OUR

COSTS OF CONVEYING MEDICAL INFORMATION ABOUT THE PRODUCT TO THE MEDICAL COMMUNITY. IN ADDITION, THE

FDA APPROVAL PROCESS EXEMPTS GENERICS FROM COSTLY AND TIME-CONSUMING CLINICAL TRIALS TO DEMONSTRATE

THEIR SAFETY AND EFFICACY, AND ALLOWS GENERIC MANUFACTURERS TO RELY ON THE SAFETY AND EFFICACY OF

THE PIONEER PRODUCT. GENERIC PRODUCTS NEED ONLY DEMONSTRATE A LEVEL OF AVAILABILITY IN THE

BLOODSTREAM EQUIVALENT TO THAT OF THE PIONEER PRODUCT. THIS MEANS THAT, AFTER WE HAVE BORNE THE

EXPENSES OF DISCOVERING, DEVELOPING AND TESTING A MEDICINE FOR SAFETY AND EFFICACY, OBTAINING

REGULATORY APPROVAL AND INFORMING THE MEDICAL COMMUNITY ABOUT ITS THERAPEUTIC BENEFITS, GENERIC

COMPETITORS CAN MARKET A COMPETING VERSION OF OUR

PRODUCT AFTER THE EXPIRATION OR LOSS OF OUR PATENT AND CHARGE MUCH LESS.

AS NOTED ABOVE, MCOS THAT FOCUS PRIMARILY ON THE IMMEDIATE COST OF DRUGS OFTEN FAVOR GENERICS

OVER BRAND-NAME DRUGS. MANY GOVERNMENTS ALSO ENCOURAGE THE USE OF GENERICS AS ALTERNATIVES TO

BRAND-NAME DRUGS IN THEIR HEALTH CARE PROGRAMS, INCLUDING MEDICAID IN THE U.S. LAWS IN THE U.S.

GENERALLY ALLOW, AND IN SOME CASES REQUIRE,

11

TABLE OF CONTENTS

PHARMACISTS TO SUBSTITUTE GENERIC DRUGS THAT HAVE BEEN

RATED UNDER GOVERNMENT PROCEDURES TO BE THERAPEUTICALLY EQUIVALENT TO BRAND-NAME DRUGS. THE

SUBSTITUTION MUST BE MADE UNLESS THE PRESCRIBING PHYSICIAN EXPRESSLY FORBIDS IT. AS AND WHEN

APPROPRIATE, WE WILL EMPLOY OUR GREENSTONE LTD. SUBSIDIARY TO LAUNCH OUR OWN GENERIC VERSIONS OF

PRODUCTS AFTER WE LOSE MARKET EXCLUSIVITY.

RAW MATERIALS

RAW MATERIALS ESSENTIAL TO OUR BUSINESSES ARE PURCHASED WORLDWIDE IN THE ORDINARY COURSE

OF BUSINESS FROM NUMEROUS SUPPLIERS. IN GENERAL, THESE MATERIALS ARE AVAILABLE FROM MULTIPLE

SOURCES. NO SERIOUS SHORTAGES OR DELAYS WERE ENCOUNTERED IN 2004, AND NONE ARE EXPECTED IN 2005.

GOVERNMENT REGULATION AND PRICE CONSTRAINTS

IN THE UNITED STATES

GENERAL.

PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES ARE SUBJECT TO EXTENSIVE REGULATION BY

NATIONAL, STATE AND LOCAL AGENCIES IN THE COUNTRIES IN WHICH THEY DO BUSINESS. OF PARTICULAR

IMPORTANCE IS THE FDA IN THE U.S. IT HAS JURISDICTION OVER OUR HUMAN PHARMACEUTICAL BUSINESS AND

ADMINISTERS REQUIREMENTS COVERING THE TESTING, SAFETY, EFFECTIVENESS, MANUFACTURING, LABELING,

MARKETING, ADVERTISING AND POST-MARKETING SURVEILLANCE OF OUR PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS. THE FDA ALSO

REGULATES MOST OF OUR CONSUMER HEALTHCARE PRODUCTS AND, ALONG WITH THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF

AGRICULTURE AND THE U.S. ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY, OUR ANIMAL HEALTH PRODUCTS.

IN ADDITION, MANY OF OUR ACTIVITIES ARE SUBJECT TO THE JURISDICTION OF VARIOUS OTHER FEDERAL

REGULATORY AND ENFORCEMENT DEPARTMENTS AND AGENCIES, SUCH AS THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN

SERVICES, THE FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION AND THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE. INDIVIDUAL STATES, ACTING

THROUGH THEIR ATTORNEYS GENERAL, HAVE BECOME ACTIVE AS WELL, SEEKING TO REGULATE THE MARKETING OF

PRESCRIPTION DRUGS UNDER STATE CONSUMER PROTECTION AND FALSE ADVERTISING LAWS.

WE ARE SUBJECT TO POSSIBLE ADMINISTRATIVE AND LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND ACTIONS BY THESE VARIOUS

REGULATORY BODIES (SEE NOTE 17 TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS,

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND

CONTINGENCIES,

IN OUR 2004 FINANCIAL REPORT). SUCH ACTIONS MAY INCLUDE PRODUCT RECALLS, SEIZURES

AND OTHER CIVIL AND CRIMINAL SANCTIONS.

MEDICARE.

IN DECEMBER 2003, THE MEDICARE PRESCRIPTION DRUG IMPROVEMENT AND

MODERNIZATION ACT OF 2003 (THE 2003 MEDICARE ACT) WAS ENACTED. UNDER THIS LEGISLATION, MEDICARE

BENEFICIARIES ARE ELIGIBLE TO OBTAIN A MEDICARE-ENDORSED, DRUG-DISCOUNT CARD FROM AN MCO, PBM OR

OTHER PRIVATE SECTOR PROVIDER THROUGH THE END OF 2005. BEGINNING IN 2006, MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES

WILL BE ELIGIBLE TO OBTAIN SUBSIDIZED PRESCRIPTION DRUG COVERAGE FROM A PRIVATE SECTOR PROVIDER. IT

REMAINS DIFFICULT TO PREDICT THE IMPACT OF THE 2003 MEDICARE ACT ON PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES. USAGE

OF PHARMACEUTICALS MAY INCREASE AS THE RESULT OF THE EXPANDED ACCESS TO MEDICINES AFFORDED BY THE

PARTIAL REIMBURSEMENT UNDER MEDICARE. SUCH POTENTIAL SALES INCREASES, HOWEVER, MAY BE OFFSET BY

INCREASED PRICING PRESSURES DUE TO THE ENHANCED PURCHASING POWER OF THE PRIVATE SECTOR PROVIDERS

THAT WILL NEGOTIATE ON BEHALF OF MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES.

PFIZER IS COMMITTED TO HELPING THOSE WITHOUT COVERAGE ACCESS PFIZER PRODUCTS. TO THAT END, IN

2004, WE IMPLEMENTED OUR HELPFUL ANSWERS PROGRAM, AN UMBRELLA PROGRAM THAT INCLUDES EXISTING PFIZER

PATIENT ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS, AS WELL AS PFIZER PFRIENDS, A NEW PRESCRIPTION DISCOUNT CARD OFFERING

SAVINGS ON PFIZER PRESCRIPTION MEDICINES TO ALL UNINSURED AMERICANS, REGARDLESS OF AGE OR INCOME.

IN ADDITION, THROUGH MANY MEDICARE-APPROVED DRUG DISCOUNT CARDS, INCLUDING THE U-SHARE CARD ON

WHICH PFIZER PARTNERS WITH UNITED HEALTHCARE, QUALIFIED LOW-INCOME MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES HAVE

ACCESS TO UP TO A THIRTY DAY SUPPLY OF MANY PFIZER MEDICINES FOR A FLAT FEE OF

$15 PER PRESCRIPTION AFTER THEY HAVE EXHAUSTED THE GOVERNMENTS $600 ANNUAL CREDIT. TO DATE,

APPROXIMATELY 18 CARDS OFFER SUCH A DISCOUNT. IN JANUARY 2005, WE ALSO JOINED TOGETHER RX ACCESS

WITH NINE OTHER PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES TO OFFER SAVINGS ON OVER 275 MEDICINES TO

MEDICARE-INELIGIBLE, UNINSURED INDIVIDUALS UNDER 65 WHO FALL BELOW CERTAIN INCOME THRESHOLDS.

IMPORTATION OF DRUGS

. THERE IS CONSIDERABLE POLITICAL PRESSURE TO ALLOW THE

IMPORTATION INTO THE U.S. OF PRESCRIPTION DRUGS THAT ARE MARKETED OUTSIDE THE U.S. AND SOLD AT

PRICES THAT ARE

12

TABLE OF CONTENTS

REGULATED BY THE GOVERNMENTS OF VARIOUS FOREIGN COUNTRIES. IN ADDITION TO RAISING

SAFETY CONCERNS, SUCH IMPORTATION COULD IMPACT PHARMACEUTICAL PRICES IN THE U.S. WHILE THE 2003

MEDICARE ACT MAINTAINS THE CURRENT PROHIBITION ON SUCH IMPORTS, IT WOULD ALLOW IMPORTATION FROM

CANADA IF THE SECRETARY OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES CERTIFIES THAT SUCH IMPORTATION IS SAFE AND

WOULD RESULT IN SAVINGS TO CONSUMERS. BEFORE THE 2003 MEDICARE ACT, FEDERAL LAW WOULD HAVE

PERMITTED IMPORTATION OF MEDICINES INTO THE U.S. FROM A CONSIDERABLY LARGER GROUP OF DEVELOPED

COUNTRIES, PROVIDED THE SECRETARY OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES MADE THE SAME SAFETY AND

COST-SAVINGS CERTIFICATIONS. ON DECEMBER 21, 2004, THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES

(HHS) AND THE DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE ISSUED THEIR REPORTS ON DRUG IMPORTATION AND FOREIGN PRICE

CONTROLS. THE HHS REPORT NOTED THAT IT WOULD BE EXTRAORDINARILY DIFFICULT TO ENSURE THAT DRUGS

PERSONALLY IMPORTED BY INDIVIDUAL CONSUMERS COULD MEET THE STANDARDS OF SAFETY THAT WOULD SUPPORT

CERTIFYING AS SAFE SUCH IMPORTATION. WHILE THE REPORT ALSO CONCLUDED THAT THE U.S. COULD ESTABLISH

A FEASIBLE BASIS FOR COMMERCIAL DRUG IMPORTATION, SUCH A CHANGE IN THE LAW WOULD REQUIRE NEW LEGAL

AUTHORITIES, SUBSTANTIAL ADDITIONAL RESOURCES AND SIGNIFICANT RESTRICTIONS ON THE TYPES OF DRUGS

THAT COULD BE IMPORTED. THE REPORT ALSO NOTED THAT THE TOTAL SAVINGS TO BE EXPECTED FROM SUCH A

COMMERCIAL IMPORTATION REGIME WOULD BE RELATIVELY SMALL1% OR 2% OF TOTAL DRUG SPENDING IN THE U.S.

THE COMMERCE DEPARTMENT REPORT CONFIRMED THAT THE LOWER PRICES IN MANY COUNTRIES RESULT FROM

GOVERNMENTAL PRICE CONTROLS, AND THESE PRICE CONTROLS ADVERSELY AFFECT THE AMOUNT OF FUNDING THAT

IS AVAILABLE FOR THE DISCOVERY OF NEW DRUGS.

MEDICAID AND RELATED MATTERS

. IN RECENT YEARS, VARIOUS PROPOSALS HAVE BEEN OFFERED AT

THE FEDERAL AND STATE LEVELS THAT WOULD BRING ABOUT MAJOR CHANGES IN THE MEDICAID PROGRAM. DRIVEN

BY BUDGET CONCERNS, SOME STATES HAVE IMPLEMENTED AND OTHER STATES ARE CONSIDERING IMPORTATION

PROGRAMS, PRICE CONTROLS OR PATIENT-ACCESS CONSTRAINTS ON MEDICINES UNDER THE MEDICAID PROGRAM. IF

CHANGES ARE IMPLEMENTED UNDER THE MEDICAID PROGRAM THAT RESTRICT THE ACCESS OF A SIGNIFICANT

POPULATION OF PATIENTS TO OUR INNOVATIVE MEDICINES, OUR BUSINESS COULD BE MATERIALLY AFFECTED. IN

ADDITION, SOME STATES ARE CONSIDERING PRICE-CONTROL REGIMES THAT

WOULD APPLY TO BROADER SEGMENTS OF THEIR POPULATIONS THAT ARE NOT

MEDICAID ELIGIBLE, AS WELL AS VARIOUS APPROACHES TO CONTROLLING PHARMACEUTICAL

MARKETING.

U.S. LAW REQUIRES US TO GIVE REBATES TO STATE MEDICAID AGENCIES BASED ON EACH STATES

REIMBURSEMENT OF PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS UNDER THE MEDICAID PROGRAM. SOME STATES AND MULTI-STATE

POOLS ARE SEEKING REBATES IN EXCESS OF THE AMOUNTS REQUIRED BY FEDERAL LAW, AND THERE ARE FEDERAL

LEGISLATIVE PROPOSALS TO EXPAND CURRENT MEDICAID REBATES. WE ALSO MUST GIVE DISCOUNTS OR REBATES ON

PURCHASES OR REIMBURSEMENTS OF PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS BY CERTAIN OTHER FEDERAL AND STATE AGENCIES

AND PROGRAMS. SEE THE DISCUSSION REGARDING REBATES IN THE REVENUES

SECTION OF OUR 2004 FINANCIAL

REPORT, AND IN NOTE 1-G TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS,

SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES,

REVENUES,

IN OUR 2004 FINANCIAL REPORT, WHICH DISCUSSIONS ARE INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE.

OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES

WE ENCOUNTER SIMILAR REGULATORY AND LEGISLATIVE ISSUES IN MOST OTHER COUNTRIES. IN EUROPE

AND SOME OTHER INTERNATIONAL MARKETS, THE GOVERNMENT PROVIDES HEALTH CARE AT LOW DIRECT COST TO

CONSUMERS AND REGULATES PHARMACEUTICAL PRICES OR PATIENT REIMBURSEMENT LEVELS TO CONTROL COSTS FOR

THE GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED HEALTH CARE SYSTEM. THIS INTERNATIONAL PATCHWORK OF PRICE REGULATION HAS

LED TO DIFFERENT PRICES AND SOME THIRD-PARTY TRADE IN OUR PRODUCTS FROM MARKETS WITH LOWER PRICES.

SUCH TRADE EXPLOITING PRICE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN COUNTRIES CAN UNDERMINE OUR SALES IN MARKETS WITH

HIGHER PRICES.

SINCE 1998, THE APPROVAL OF NEW DRUGS ACROSS THE E.U. IS POSSIBLE ONLY USING THE MUTUAL

RECOGNITION PROCEDURE OR EMEAS CENTRAL APPROVAL

PROCESS. THE USE OF EITHER OF THESE PROCEDURES PROVIDES A MORE RAPID AND CONSISTENT APPROVAL

WITHIN THE MEMBER STATES THAN WAS THE CASE WHEN THE APPROVAL PROCESSES WERE OPERATING INDEPENDENTLY

WITHIN EACH MEMBER STATE. FURTHER, NORWAY AND ICELAND ARE FULL PARTICIPANTS IN THESE APPROVAL

PROCESSES. THE ADDITION OF TEN NEW MEMBER STATES TO THE E.U. IN MAY 2004 HAS EXTENDED THE SCOPE OF

THESE APPROVAL PROCEDURES. SINCE THE E.U. DOES NOT HAVE JURISDICTION OVER PATIENT REIMBURSEMENT OR

PRICING MATTERS IN ITS MEMBER STATES, WE WILL CONTINUE TO DEAL WITH

13

TABLE OF CONTENTS

INDIVIDUAL COUNTRIES ON SUCH

ISSUES ACROSS THE ENLARGED E.U.

DURING 2004, A COMPREHENSIVE PACKAGE OF REFORMS WAS ADOPTED, AMENDING E.U. LAW ON THE

REGULATION OF MEDICINAL PRODUCTS IN MANY AREAS, INCLUDING APPROVAL PROCEDURES AND SAFETY REPORTING.

OF PARTICULAR NOTE, THE DATA EXCLUSIVITY PERIODS DURING WHICH INNOVATIVE COMPANIES REGULATORY DATA

ARE PROTECTED WILL BE HARMONIZED IN ALL MEMBER STATES, AND THE APPROVAL AND LAUNCH OF GENERIC

MEDICINES WILL BE FACILITATED IN SEVERAL RESPECTS. THE NEW LAW, DUE TO TAKE EFFECT BY NOVEMBER

2005, WILL ALSO SHORTEN CERTAIN APPROVAL TIMELINES AND INTRODUCE FAST-TRACK AND CONDITIONAL

CENTRALIZED AUTHORIZATIONS.

ENVIRONMENTAL LAW COMPLIANCE

MOST OF OUR OPERATIONS ARE AFFECTED BY FEDERAL, STATE AND/OR LOCAL ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS. WE

HAVE MADE, AND INTEND TO CONTINUE TO MAKE, NECESSARY EXPENDITURES FOR COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE

LAWS. WE ALSO ARE CLEANING UP ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINATION FROM PAST INDUSTRIAL ACTIVITY AT CERTAIN

SITES (SEE NOTE 17 TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS,

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND CONTINGENCIES,

IN OUR 2004 FINANCIAL REPORT). AS A RESULT, WE INCURRED CAPITAL AND OPERATIONAL EXPENDITURES IN

2004 FOR THE CLEAN-UP OF CERTAIN PAST INDUSTRIAL ACTIVITY AND FOR OTHER ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLIANCE

PURPOSES AS FOLLOWS.



ENVIRONMENT-RELATED CAPITAL EXPENDITURES  $68 MILLION



OTHER ENVIRONMENT-RELATED EXPENSES  $274 MILLION

WHILE WE CANNOT PREDICT WITH CERTAINTY FUTURE CAPITAL EXPENDITURES OR OPERATING COSTS FOR

ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLIANCE, WE DO NOT BELIEVE THEY WILL HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON OUR CAPITAL

EXPENDITURES, EARNINGS OR COMPETITIVE POSITION.

TAX MATTERS

THE DISCUSSION OF TAX-RELATED MATTERS IN NOTE 5 TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS,

TAXES ON INCOME

, IN OUR 2004 FINANCIAL REPORT, IS INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE.

EMPLOYEES

IN OUR INNOVATION-INTENSIVE BUSINESS, OUR EMPLOYEES ARE VITAL TO OUR SUCCESS. WE BELIEVE

WE HAVE GOOD RELATIONSHIPS WITH OUR EMPLOYEES. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2004, WE EMPLOYED APPROXIMATELY

115,000 PEOPLE IN OUR OPERATIONS THROUGHOUT THE WORLD.

CAUTIONARY FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT FUTURE RESULTS

(CAUTIONARY STATEMENTS UNDER THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995)

OUR DISCLOSURE AND ANALYSIS IN THIS 2004

FORM 10-K

AND IN OUR 2004 ANNUAL REPORT TO

SHAREHOLDERS CONTAIN SOME FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS THAT SET FORTH ANTICIPATED RESULTS BASED ON

MANAGEMENTS PLANS AND ASSUMPTIONS. FROM TIME TO TIME, WE ALSO PROVIDE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

IN OTHER MATERIALS WE RELEASE TO THE PUBLIC AS WELL AS ORAL FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS. SUCH

STATEMENTS GIVE OUR CURRENT EXPECTATIONS OR FORECASTS OF FUTURE EVENTS; THEY DO NOT RELATE STRICTLY

TO HISTORICAL OR CURRENT FACTS. WE HAVE TRIED, WHEREVER POSSIBLE, TO IDENTIFY SUCH STATEMENTS BY

USING WORDS SUCH AS ANTICIPATE, ESTIMATE, EXPECT, PROJECT, INTEND, PLAN, BELIEVE,

WILL AND SIMILAR EXPRESSIONS IN CONNECTION WITH ANY DISCUSSION OF FUTURE OPERATING OR FINANCIAL

PERFORMANCE. IN PARTICULAR, THESE INCLUDE STATEMENTS RELATING TO FUTURE ACTIONS, PROSPECTIVE

PRODUCTS OR PRODUCT APPROVALS, FUTURE PERFORMANCE OR RESULTS OF CURRENT AND ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS,

SALES EFFORTS, EXPENSES, INTEREST RATES, FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES, THE OUTCOME OF

CONTINGENCIES, SUCH AS LEGAL PROCEEDINGS, AND FINANCIAL RESULTS.

WE CANNOT GUARANTEE THAT ANY FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENT WILL BE REALIZED, ALTHOUGH WE BELIEVE

WE HAVE BEEN PRUDENT IN OUR PLANS AND ASSUMPTIONS. ACHIEVEMENT OF FUTURE RESULTS IS SUBJECT TO

RISKS, UNCERTAINTIES AND POTENTIALLY INACCURATE ASSUMPTIONS. SHOULD KNOWN OR UNKNOWN RISKS OR

UNCERTAINTIES MATERIALIZE, OR SHOULD UNDERLYING ASSUMPTIONS PROVE INACCURATE, ACTUAL RESULTS COULD

DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM PAST RESULTS AND THOSE ANTICIPATED, ESTIMATED OR PROJECTED. YOU SHOULD BEAR

THIS IN MIND AS YOU CONSIDER FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS.

WE UNDERTAKE NO OBLIGATION TO PUBLICLY UPDATE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS, WHETHER AS A RESULT

OF NEW INFORMATION, FUTURE EVENTS OR OTHERWISE. YOU

14

TABLE OF CONTENTS

ARE ADVISED, HOWEVER, TO CONSULT ANY FURTHER

DISCLOSURES WE MAKE ON RELATED SUBJECTS IN OUR 10-Q AND 8-K REPORTS TO THE SEC. ALSO NOTE THAT WE

PROVIDE THE FOLLOWING CAUTIONARY DISCUSSION OF RISKS, UNCERTAINTIES AND POSSIBLY INACCURATE

ASSUMPTIONS RELEVANT TO OUR BUSINESSES. THESE ARE FACTORS THAT, INDIVIDUALLY OR IN THE AGGREGATE,

WE THINK COULD CAUSE OUR ACTUAL RESULTS TO DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM EXPECTED AND HISTORICAL RESULTS.

WE NOTE THESE FACTORS FOR INVESTORS AS PERMITTED BY THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF

1995. YOU SHOULD UNDERSTAND THAT IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO PREDICT OR IDENTIFY ALL SUCH FACTORS.

CONSEQUENTLY, YOU SHOULD NOT CONSIDER THE FOLLOWING TO BE A COMPLETE DISCUSSION OF ALL POTENTIAL

RISKS OR UNCERTAINTIES.

 U.S. AND FOREIGN GOVERNMENTAL REGULATIONS MANDATING PRICE CONTROLS AND PATIENT-ACCESS

CONSTRAINTS IMPACT OUR BUSINESS, AND OUR FUTURE RESULTS COULD BE AFFECTED BY CHANGES IN SUCH

REGULATIONS. IN THE U.S., MANY PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS ARE SUBJECT TO INCREASING PRICING PRESSURES.

SUCH PRESSURES MAY INCREASE AS THE RESULT OF THE 2003 MEDICARE ACT. ON THE OTHER HAND, USAGE OF

PHARMACEUTICALS ALSO MAY INCREASE DUE TO THE EXPANDED ACCESS TO MEDICINES AFFORDED BY THE PARTIAL

REIMBURSEMENT UNDER THE 2003 MEDICARE ACT. IN ADDITION, MCOS AS WELL AS MEDICAID AND OTHER

GOVERNMENT AGENCIES CONTINUE TO SEEK PRICE DISCOUNTS. GOVERNMENT EFFORTS TO REDUCE MEDICAID

EXPENSES MAY CONTINUE TO INCREASE THE USE OF MCOS. THIS MAY RESULT IN MANAGED CARES INFLUENCING

PRESCRIPTION DECISIONS FOR A LARGER SEGMENT OF THE POPULATION. IN ADDITION, SOME STATES HAVE

IMPLEMENTED AND OTHER STATES ARE CONSIDERING PRICE CONTROLS OR PATIENT-ACCESS CONSTRAINTS UNDER THE

MEDICAID PROGRAM AND SOME STATES ARE CONSIDERING PRICE-CONTROL REGIMES THAT WOULD APPLY TO

BROADER SEGMENTS OF THEIR POPULATIONS THAT ARE NOT MEDICAID ELIGIBLE. OTHER MATTERS THAT COULD BE THE SUBJECT OF U.S. FEDERAL OR STATE LEGISLATIVE OR

REGULATORY ACTION AFFECTING OUR BUSINESS INCLUDE THE IMPORTATION OF PRESCRIPTION DRUGS THAT ARE

MARKETED OUTSIDE THE U.S. AND SOLD AT PRICES THAT ARE REGULATED BY THE GOVERNMENTS OF VARIOUS

FOREIGN COUNTRIES AND THE INVOLUNTARY APPROVAL OF PRESCRIPTION MEDICINES FOR OTC USE.

WE ENCOUNTER SIMILAR REGULATORY AND LEGISLATIVE ISSUES IN MOST OTHER COUNTRIES. IN EUROPE AND

SOME OTHER INTERNATIONAL MARKETS, THE GOVERNMENT PROVIDES HEALTH CARE AT LOW DIRECT COST TO

CONSUMERS AND REGULATES PHARMACEUTICAL PRICES OR PATIENT REIMBURSEMENT LEVELS TO CONTROL COSTS FOR

THE GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED HEALTH CARE SYSTEM. THIS INTERNATIONAL PATCHWORK OF PRICE REGULATION HAS

LED TO DIFFERENT PRICES AND SOME THIRD-PARTY TRADE IN OUR PRODUCTS FROM MARKETS WITH LOWER PRICES.

SUCH TRADE EXPLOITING PRICE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN COUNTRIES CAN UNDERMINE OUR SALES IN MARKETS WITH

HIGHER PRICES.

AS A RESULT, IT IS EXPECTED THAT PRESSURES ON THE PRICING COMPONENT OF OPERATING RESULTS WILL

CONTINUE.

 COMPETITION FROM MANUFACTURERS OF GENERIC DRUGS IS A MAJOR CHALLENGE IN THE U.S. AND IS

GROWING INTERNATIONALLY. UPON THE EXPIRATION OR LOSS OF PATENT PROTECTION FOR A PRODUCT, OR UPON

THE AT-RISK LAUNCH (WHILE PATENT INFRINGEMENT LITIGATION AGAINST THE GENERIC PRODUCT IS PENDING) BY

A GENERIC MANUFACTURER OF A GENERIC VERSION OF A PRODUCT, WE CAN LOSE THE MAJOR PORTION OF SALES OF

THAT PRODUCT IN A VERY SHORT PERIOD. THE PATENTS COVERING SEVERAL OF OUR MOST IMPORTANT MEDICINES,

INCLUDING

LIPITOR

,

NORVASC

,

NEURONTIN, CELEBREX

,

XALATAN

AND

DETROL

, ARE BEING CHALLENGED BY

GENERIC MANUFACTURERS.

 WE CANNOT PREDICT WITH ACCURACY THE TIMING OR IMPACT OF THE INTRODUCTION OF COMPETITIVE

PRODUCTS OR THEIR POSSIBLE EFFECT ON OUR SALES. PRODUCTS THAT COMPETE WITH OUR DRUGS, INCLUDING

SOME OF OUR BEST-SELLING MEDICINES, ARE LAUNCHED FROM TIME TO TIME. LAUNCHES OF A NUMBER OF

COMPETITIVE PRODUCTS HAVE OCCURRED RECENTLY, AND CERTAIN POTENTIALLY COMPETITIVE PRODUCTS ARE IN

VARIOUS STAGES OF DEVELOPMENT, SOME OF WHICH HAVE BEEN

FILED FOR APPROVAL WITH THE FDA AND WITH REGULATORY AUTHORITIES IN OTHER COUNTRIES.

 WE RECORDED PRODUCT SALES OF MORE THAN $1 BILLION FOR EACH OF TEN PHARMACEUTICAL

PRODUCTS IN 2004.

LIPITOR, NORVASC, ZOLOFT, CELEBREX, NEURONTIN, ZITHROMAX, VIAGRA, ZYRTEC, BEXTRA

AND

XALATAN.

THOSE PRODUCTS ACCOUNTED FOR 61% OF OUR TOTAL 2004 REVENUES. IF THESE OR ANY OF OUR OTHER

MAJOR PRODUCTS WERE TO BECOME SUBJECT TO A PROBLEM SUCH AS LOSS OF PATENT PROTECTION, MATERIAL

PRODUCT LIABILITY LITIGATION, UNEXPECTED SIDE EFFECTS, REGULATORY PROCEEDINGS, PUBLICITY AFFECTING

DOCTOR OR PATIENT CONFIDENCE OR PRESSURE FROM EXISTING COMPETITIVE PRODUCTS, OR IF A NEW, MORE

EFFECTIVE TREATMENT SHOULD BE INTRODUCED, THE IMPACT ON OUR REVENUES COULD BE SIGNIFICANT. AS

NOTED, PATENTS

15

TABLE OF CONTENTS

COVERING SEVERAL OF OUR BEST-SELLING MEDICINES ARE THE SUBJECT OF PENDING LEGAL

CHALLENGES.

 FINAL ACTIONS RELATING TO

CELEBREX

AND/OR

BEXTRA

THAT MAY BE TAKEN BY THE FDA AND/OR

THE EMEA IN CONNECTION WITH THEIR RESPECTIVE REVIEWS OF THE BENEFITS AND RISKS OF COX-2-SPECIFIC

INHIBITOR MEDICINES AND RELATED AGENTS COULD RESULT IN A SIGNIFICANT LOSS OF SALES OF ONE OR BOTH

OF THOSE DRUGS, WHICH WOULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

 THE DISCOVERY AND DEVELOPMENT OF NEW PRODUCTS AS WELL AS THE DEVELOPMENT OF ADDITIONAL

USES FOR EXISTING PRODUCTS IS VERY IMPORTANT TO THE SUCCESS OF THE COMPANY. HOWEVER, BALANCING

CURRENT GROWTH AND INVESTMENT FOR THE FUTURE REMAINS A MAJOR CHALLENGE. OUR ONGOING INVESTMENTS IN

NEW PRODUCT INTRODUCTIONS AND IN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT FOR NEW PRODUCTS AND EXISTING PRODUCT

EXTENSIONS COULD EXCEED CORRESPONDING SALES GROWTH. THIS COULD PRODUCE HIGHER COSTS WITHOUT A

PROPORTIONAL INCREASE IN REVENUES.

 RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES PARTICULARLY APPLY WITH RESPECT TO PRODUCT-RELATED,

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS. THE OUTCOME OF THE LENGTHY AND COMPLEX PROCESS OF IDENTIFYING NEW

COMPOUNDS AND DEVELOPING NEW PRODUCTS IS INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE AS TO

WHETHER OR WHEN WE WILL RECEIVE REGULATORY APPROVAL FOR NEW PRODUCTS OR FOR NEW INDICATIONS OR

DOSAGE FORMS FOR EXISTING PRODUCTS. DECISIONS BY REGULATORY AUTHORITIES REGARDING LABELING AND

OTHER MATTERS COULD AFFECT THE COMMERCIAL POTENTIAL OF OUR PRODUCTS. THERE ALSO ARE MANY

CONSIDERATIONS THAT CAN AFFECT MARKETING OF PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS AROUND THE WORLD. REGULATORY

DELAYS, THE INABILITY TO SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETE CLINICAL TRIALS, CLAIMS AND CONCERNS ABOUT SAFETY

AND EFFICACY, NEW DISCOVERIES, PATENT DISPUTES AND CLAIMS ABOUT ADVERSE SIDE EFFECTS ARE A FEW OF

THE FACTORS THAT COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE REALIZATION OF RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT AND

PRODUCT-RELATED, FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS.

 DECISIONS ABOUT RESEARCH STUDIES MADE EARLY IN THE DEVELOPMENT PROCESS OF A DRUG

CANDIDATE CAN HAVE A SUBSTANTIAL IMPACT ON THE MARKETING STRATEGY ONCE THE DRUG RECEIVES APPROVAL.

MORE DETAILED STUDIES MAY DEMONSTRATE ADDITIONAL BENEFITS THAT CAN HELP IN THE MARKETING, BUT THEY

CONSUME TIME AND RESOURCES AND CAN DELAY SUBMITTING THE DRUG CANDIDATE FOR INITIAL APPROVAL. WE TRY

TO PLAN CLINICAL TRIALS PRUDENTLY, BUT THERE IS NO GUARANTEE THAT A PROPER BALANCE OF SPEED AND

TESTING WILL BE MADE IN EACH CASE. THE QUALITY OF OUR DECISIONS IN THIS AREA COULD AFFECT OUR

FUTURE RESULTS.

 44% OF OUR 2004 REVENUES WERE DERIVED FROM INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS, INCLUDING 6% FROM

JAPAN. THESE INTERNATIONAL-BASED REVENUES AS WELL AS OUR SUBSTANTIAL INTERNATIONAL ASSETS EXPOSE

OUR REVENUES AND EARNINGS TO FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE CHANGES. IN ADDITION, OUR

INTEREST-BEARING INVESTMENTS, LOANS AND BORROWINGS ARE SUBJECT TO RISK FROM CHANGES IN INTEREST

RATES. THESE RISKS AND THE MEASURES WE HAVE TAKEN TO HELP CONTAIN THEM ARE DISCUSSED IN THE SECTION

ENTITLED FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT IN OUR 2004 FINANCIAL REPORT. FOR ADDITIONAL DETAILS, SEE NOTE

8-D TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS,

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS: DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL

INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES

, IN OUR 2004 FINANCIAL REPORT. THOSE SECTIONS OF OUR 2004

FINANCIAL REPORT ARE INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE.

NOTWITHSTANDING OUR EFFORTS TO FORESEE AND MITIGATE THE EFFECTS OF CHANGES IN FISCAL

CIRCUMSTANCES, WE CANNOT PREDICT WITH CERTAINTY CHANGES IN CURRENCY AND INTEREST RATES, INFLATION

OR OTHER RELATED FACTORS AFFECTING OUR BUSINESSES.

 OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS ALSO COULD BE AFFECTED BY CHANGES IN INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

LEGAL PROTECTIONS AND REMEDIES, TRADE REGULATIONS AND PROCEDURES AND ACTIONS AFFECTING APPROVAL,

PRODUCTION, PRICING, REIMBURSEMENT AND MARKETING

OF PRODUCTS, AS WELL AS BY UNSTABLE GOVERNMENTS AND LEGAL SYSTEMS AND INTER-GOVERNMENTAL DISPUTES.

 DIFFICULTIES OR DELAYS IN PRODUCT MANUFACTURING OR MARKETING, INCLUDING, BUT NOT

LIMITED TO, THE INABILITY TO INCREASE PRODUCTION CAPACITY COMMENSURATE WITH DEMAND, OR THE FAILURE

TO PREDICT MARKET DEMAND FOR, OR TO GAIN MARKET ACCEPTANCE OF, APPROVED PRODUCTS, COULD AFFECT

FUTURE RESULTS.

 GROWTH IN COSTS AND EXPENSES, CHANGES IN PRODUCT MIX AND THE IMPACT OF ACQUISITIONS,

DIVESTITURES, RESTRUCTURINGS, PRODUCT WITHDRAWALS AND OTHER UNUSUAL EVENTS THAT COULD RESULT FROM

EVOLVING BUSINESS STRATEGIES, EVALUATION OF ASSET REALIZATION AND ORGANIZATIONAL RESTRUCTURING

COULD AFFECT FUTURE RESULTS. SUCH RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES

16

TABLE OF CONTENTS

INCLUDE, IN PARTICULAR, OUR ABILITY TO

INTEGRATE AND TO OBTAIN THE ANTICIPATED RESULTS AND SYNERGIES FROM OUR ACQUISITION OF PHARMACIA.

 OUR FUTURE RESULTS COULD BE AFFECTED BY CHANGES IN LAWS AND REGULATIONS, INCLUDING

CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING STANDARDS, TAXATION REQUIREMENTS (INCLUDING TAX-RATE CHANGES, NEW TAX LAWS

AND REVISED TAX LAW INTERPRETATIONS), COMPETITION LAWS AND ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS IN THE U.S. AND OTHER

COUNTRIES.

 OUR FUTURE RESULTS COULD BE AFFECTED BY CHANGES IN BUSINESS, POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC

CONDITIONS, INCLUDING THE COST AND AVAILABILITY OF INSURANCE, DUE TO THE THREAT OF FUTURE TERRORIST

ACTIVITY IN THE U.S. AND OTHER PARTS OF THE WORLD AND RELATED U.S. MILITARY ACTION OVERSEAS.

 WE AND CERTAIN OF OUR SUBSIDIARIES ARE INVOLVED IN VARIOUS PATENT, PRODUCT LIABILITY,

CONSUMER, COMMERCIAL, SECURITIES, ENVIRONMENTAL AND TAX LITIGATIONS AND CLAIMS; GOVERNMENT

INVESTIGATIONS; AND OTHER LEGAL PROCEEDINGS THAT ARISE FROM TIME TO TIME IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF

OUR BUSINESS. WE DO NOT BELIEVE ANY OF THEM WILL HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL

POSITION. LITIGATION IS INHERENTLY UNPREDICTABLE, AND EXCESSIVE VERDICTS DO OCCUR. ALTHOUGH WE

BELIEVE WE HAVE SUBSTANTIAL DEFENSES IN THESE MATTERS, WE COULD IN THE FUTURE INCUR JUDGMENTS OR

ENTER INTO SETTLEMENTS OF CLAIMS THAT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS IN ANY PARTICULAR PERIOD.

PATENT CLAIMS INCLUDE CHALLENGES TO THE COVERAGE AND/OR VALIDITY OF OUR PATENTS ON VARIOUS

PRODUCTS OR PROCESSES. ALTHOUGH WE BELIEVE WE HAVE SUBSTANTIAL DEFENSES TO THESE CHALLENGES WITH

RESPECT TO ALL OUR MATERIAL PATENTS, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE AS TO THE OUTCOME OF THESE MATTERS,

AND A LOSS IN ANY OF THESE CASES COULD RESULT IN A LOSS OF PATENT PROTECTION FOR THE DRUG AT ISSUE,

WHICH COULD LEAD TO A SIGNIFICANT LOSS OF SALES OF THAT DRUG AND COULD MATERIALLY AFFECT FUTURE

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.
