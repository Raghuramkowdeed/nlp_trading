BUSINESS SEGMENTS

WE OPERATE IN TWO BUSINESS SEGMENTS: PHARMACEUTICAL AND ANIMAL HEALTH.

WE ALSO OPERATE SEVERAL OTHER BUSINESSES, INCLUDING THE MANUFACTURE OF GELATIN CAPSULES, CONTRACT MANUFACTURING AND BULK PHARMACEUTICAL CHEMICALS. DUE TO THE SIZE OF THESE SMALL BUSINESSES,

THEY ARE GROUPED INTO THE CORPORATE/OTHER CATEGORY OF OUR SEGMENT INFORMATION.

SEGMENT, GEOGRAPHIC AND REVENUE INFORMATION,

IN OUR 2007 FINANCIAL REPORT. THE INFORMATION FROM THOSE SECTIONS OF OUR 2007 FINANCIAL REPORT IS INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE IN THIS 2007 FORM 10-K.

OUR BUSINESSES ARE HEAVILY REGULATED IN MOST OF THE COUNTRIES WHERE WE OPERATE. IN THE U.S., THE PRINCIPAL AUTHORITY REGULATING OUR OPERATIONS IS THE FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION (FDA). THE FDA

REGULATES THE SAFETY AND EFFICACY OF THE PRODUCTS WE OFFER AND OUR RESEARCH QUALITY, MANUFACTURING PROCESSES, PRODUCT PROMOTION, ADVERTISING AND PRODUCT LABELING. SIMILAR REGULATIONS EXIST IN MOST OTHER COUNTRIES, AND IN MANY COUNTRIES THE

GOVERNMENT ALSO REGULATES OUR PRICES. SEE

GOVERNMENT REGULATION AND PRICE CONSTRAINTS

BELOW.

PHARMACEUTICAL

OUR PHARMACEUTICAL BUSINESS IS THE LARGEST PHARMACEUTICAL BUSINESS IN THE WORLD. EACH YEAR, PFIZER PHARMACEUTICALS HELP OVER 150 MILLION PEOPLE THROUGHOUT THE WORLD LIVE LONGER, HEALTHIER

LIVES. WITH MEDICINES ACROSS 11 THERAPEUTIC AREAS, WE HELP TO TREAT AND PREVENT MANY OF THE MOST COMMON AND MOST CHALLENGING CONDITIONS OF OUR TIME. OUR PRODUCTS ARE IN CARDIOVASCULAR AND METABOLIC DISEASES; CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM DISORDERS;

ARTHRITIS AND PAIN; INFECTIOUS AND RESPIRATORY DISEASES; UROLOGY; ONCOLOGY; OPHTHALMOLOGY; AND ENDOCRINE DISORDERS. AS OF OCTOBER 2007, OUR PORTFOLIO OF MEDICINES INCLUDED SEVEN MEDICINES THAT LED THEIR THERAPEUTIC AREAS BASED ON

REVENUES.

IN 2007, PHARMACEUTICAL REVENUES DECLINED 1%, TO $44.4 BILLION PRIMARILY RESULTING FROM THE EARLIER-THAN-EXPECTED LOSS OF U.S. EXCLUSIVITY FOR

NORVASC

IN AUGUST 2006. SOLID PERFORMANCE FROM PRODUCTS LAUNCHED IN THE U.S. SINCE 2005

SUCH AS LYRICA, SUTENT AND CHANTIX AND SEVERAL IN-LINE PRODUCTS, AS WELL AS THE FAVORABLE IMPACT OF FOREIGN EXCHANGE, WERE ABLE TO PARTIALLY OFFSET THESE DECLINES. REVENUES FROM THIS SEGMENT CONTRIBUTED 91.8% OF OUR TOTAL REVENUES IN 2007, 93.2% OF

OUR TOTAL REVENUES IN 2006, AND 93.4% IN 2005. IN 2007,

OUR ANIMAL HEALTH BUSINESS IS ONE OF THE LARGEST IN THE WORLD. WE DISCOVER, DEVELOP AND SELL PRODUCTS FOR THE PREVENTION AND TREATMENT OF DISEASES IN LIVESTOCK AND COMPANION ANIMALS. IN 2007,

ANIMAL HEALTH REVENUES INCREASED 14%, TO $2.6 BILLION, PRIMARILY DUE TO THE CONTINUED PERFORMANCE OF

IMPORTANT NEW PRODUCTS SUCH AS

RESEARCH AND PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT

INNOVATION BY OUR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT OPERATIONS IS VERY IMPORTANT TO THE COMPANYS SUCCESS. OUR GOAL IS TO DISCOVER, DEVELOP AND BRING TO MARKET INNOVATIVE PRODUCTS THAT ADDRESS

MAJOR UNMET MEDICAL NEEDS. THIS GOAL HAS BEEN SUPPORTED BY OUR SUBSTANTIAL RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT INVESTMENTS. WE SPENT $8.1 BILLION IN 2007, $7.6 BILLION IN 2006 AND $7.3 BILLION IN 2005 ON RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT IN SUPPORT OF

PFIZERS PHARMACEUTICAL AND ANIMAL HEALTH BUSINESSES.

WE CONDUCT RESEARCH INTERNALLY AND ALSO THROUGH CONTRACTS WITH THIRD PARTIES, THROUGH COLLABORATIONS WITH UNIVERSITIES AND BIOTECHNOLOGY COMPANIES AND IN COOPERATION WITH OTHER PHARMACEUTICAL

FIRMS. WE ALSO SEEK OUT PROMISING COMPOUNDS AND INNOVATIVE TECHNOLOGIES DEVELOPED BY THIRD PARTIES TO INCORPORATE INTO OUR DISCOVERY OR DEVELOPMENT PROCESSES OR PROJECTS, AS WELL AS OUR PRODUCT LINES, THROUGH ACQUISITION, LICENSING OR OTHER

ARRANGEMENTS.

DRUG DISCOVERY AND DEVELOPMENT IS TIME CONSUMING, EXPENSIVE AND UNPREDICTABLE. ON AVERAGE, ONLY ONE OUT OF MANY THOUSANDS OF CHEMICAL COMPOUNDS DISCOVERED BY RESEARCHERS PROVES TO BE BOTH

MEDICALLY EFFECTIVE AND SAFE ENOUGH TO BECOME AN APPROVED MEDICINE. THE PROCESS FROM EARLY DISCOVERY TO DEVELOPMENT TO REGULATORY APPROVAL CAN TAKE MORE THAN TEN YEARS. DRUG CANDIDATES CAN FAIL AT ANY STAGE OF THE PROCESS. CANDIDATES MAY NOT RECEIVE

REGULATORY APPROVAL EVEN AFTER MANY YEARS OF RESEARCH.

WE BELIEVE THAT OUR INVESTMENTS IN RESEARCH HAVE BEEN REWARDED BY THE NUMBER OF PHARMACEUTICAL COMPOUNDS WE HAVE IN ALL STAGES OF DEVELOPMENT. WE CURRENTLY ARE WORKING ON 213 PROJECTS IN

DEVELOPMENT, INCLUDING 151 NEW MOLECULAR ENTITIES AND 62 PRODUCT-LINE EXTENSIONS. IN ADDITION, WE HAVE MORE THAN 300 PROJECTS IN DISCOVERY RESEARCH. IN RECENT YEARS, OUR DISCOVERY SCIENTISTS HAVE DELIVERED OVER 100 NEW CHEMICAL COMPOUNDS TO EARLY

DEVELOPMENT. WHILE THESE NEW CANDIDATES MAY OR MAY NOT EVENTUALLY RECEIVE REGULATORY APPROVAL, NEW DRUG CANDIDATES ENTERING DEVELOPMENT ARE THE FOUNDATION FOR FUTURE PRODUCTS.

IN ADDITION TO DISCOVERING AND DEVELOPING NEW PRODUCTS, OUR RESEARCH OPERATIONS ADD VALUE TO OUR EXISTING PRODUCTS BY IMPROVING THEIR EFFECTIVENESS AND BY DISCOVERING NEW USES FOR

THEM.

INFORMATION CONCERNING SEVERAL OF OUR DRUG CANDIDATES IN DEVELOPMENT, AS WELL AS SUPPLEMENTAL FILINGS FOR EXISTING PRODUCTS, IS SET FORTH UNDER THE HEADING

PRODUCT DEVELOPMENTS

IN OUR 2007 FINANCIAL REPORT. THAT INFORMATION IS INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE.

PFIZER PROVIDES A DETAILED UPDATE OF ITS PIPELINE TWICE A YEAR, WHICH IS AVAILABLE AT

WWW.PFIZER.COM/PIPELINE

FOR

TRACKING DEVELOPMENT COMPOUNDS ACROSS PFIZERS ROBUST PIPELINE.

OUR COMPETITORS ALSO DEVOTE SUBSTANTIAL FUNDS AND RESOURCES TO RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT. IN ADDITION, THE CONSOLIDATION THAT HAS OCCURRED IN OUR INDUSTRY HAS CREATED COMPANIES WITH SUBSTANTIAL

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT RESOURCES. WE ALSO COMPETE AGAINST NUMEROUS SMALL BIOTECHNOLOGY COMPANIES IN DEVELOPING POTENTIAL DRUG CANDIDATES. THE EXTENT TO WHICH OUR COMPETITORS ARE SUCCESSFUL IN THEIR RESEARCH COULD RESULT IN EROSION OF THE SALES OF

OUR PRODUCTS AND UNANTICIPATED PRODUCT OBSOLESCENCE.

INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS

WE HAVE SIGNIFICANT OPERATIONS OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES. THEY ARE MANAGED THROUGH THE SAME BUSINESS SEGMENTS AS OUR U.S. OPERATIONS PHARMACEUTICAL AND ANIMAL HEALTH.

REVENUES FROM OPERATIONS OUTSIDE THE U.S. OF $25.3 BILLION ACCOUNTED FOR 52.2% OF OUR TOTAL REVENUES IN 2007. REVENUES EXCEEDED $500 MILLION IN EACH OF 12 COUNTRIES OUTSIDE THE U.S.

IN

2007. THE U.S. WAS THE ONLY COUNTRY TO CONTRIBUTE MORE THAN 10% OF OUR TOTAL REVENUES, COMPRISING 47.8% OF TOTAL REVENUES IN 2007, 53.4% OF TOTAL REVENUES IN 2006 AND 52.2% OF TOTAL REVENUES IN 2005. JAPAN IS OUR

SECOND-LARGEST NATIONAL MARKET, WITH 7.0% OF OUR TOTAL REVENUES IN 2007, 6.7% IN 2006 AND 7.3% IN 2005.

GOVERNMENT REGULATION AND PRICE CONSTRAINTS

BELOW FOR DISCUSSION OF THESE MATTERS.

DEPENDING ON THE DIRECTION OF CHANGE RELATIVE TO THE U.S. DOLLAR, FOREIGN CURRENCY VALUES CAN INCREASE OR DECREASE THE REPORTED DOLLAR VALUE OF OUR NET ASSETS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. IN

2007, BOTH REVENUES AND NET INCOME WERE FAVORABLY IMPACTED BY FOREIGN EXCHANGE, AS FOREIGN CURRENCY MOVEMENTS RELATIVE TO THE U.S. DOLLAR INCREASED OUR REVENUES AND NET INCOME IN MANY COUNTRIES. WHILE WE CANNOT PREDICT WITH CERTAINTY FUTURE CHANGES

IN FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES OR THE EFFECT THEY WILL HAVE ON US, WE ATTEMPT TO MITIGATE THEIR IMPACT THROUGH OPERATIONAL MEANS AND BY USING VARIOUS FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS. SEE THE DISCUSSION UNDER NOTE 10-D TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS,

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS: DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES

IN OUR 2007 FINANCIAL REPORT. THAT DISCUSSION IS INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE. RELATED INFORMATION

ABOUT VALUATION AND RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH SUCH FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS IN PARTS E AND F OF THAT NOTE IS ALSO INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE.

MARKETING

IN OUR GLOBAL PHARMACEUTICAL BUSINESS, WE PROMOTE OUR PRODUCTS TO HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS AND PATIENTS. THROUGH OUR MARKETING ORGANIZATIONS, WE EXPLAIN THE APPROVED USES, BENEFITS AND RISKS OF OUR

PRODUCTS TO HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS, SUCH AS DOCTORS, NURSE PRACTITIONERS, PHYSICIAN ASSISTANTS, PHARMACISTS, HOSPITALS, PHARMACY BENEFIT MANAGERS (PBMS), MANAGED CARE ORGANIZATIONS (MCOS), EMPLOYERS AND GOVERNMENT AGENCIES. WE ALSO MARKET DIRECTLY TO

CONSUMERS IN THE U.S., THROUGH DIRECT-TO-CONSUMER ADVERTISING THAT COMMUNICATES THE APPROVED USES, BENEFITS, AND RISKS OF OUR PRODUCTS WHILE CONTINUING TO MOTIVATE PEOPLE TO HAVE MEANINGFUL CONVERSATIONS WITH THEIR DOCTORS. IN ADDITION, WE SPONSOR

GENERAL ADVERTISING TO EDUCATE THE PUBLIC ON DISEASE AWARENESS, IMPORTANT PUBLIC HEALTH ISSUES, AND OUR PATIENT ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS.

OUR OPERATIONS INCLUDE SEVERAL PHARMACEUTICAL SALES ORGANIZATIONS. OUR STRUCTURE ALIGNS THE SALES, MARKETING, AND MEDICAL FUNCTIONS TO WORK CLOSELY IN TANDEM ALONG THE SAME THERAPEUTIC GROUPS

OF PRODUCTS, REINFORCING COMMON COORDINATION, FOCUS, AND ACCOUNTABILITY ACROSS THE ORGANIZATIONS.

OUR PRESCRIPTION PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS ARE SOLD PRINCIPALLY TO WHOLESALERS, BUT WE ALSO SELL DIRECTLY TO RETAILERS, HOSPITALS, CLINICS, GOVERNMENT AGENCIES AND PHARMACIES. WE SEEK TO GAIN

ACCESS TO HEALTH AUTHORITY, PBM AND MCO FORMULARIES (LISTS OF RECOMMENDED, APPROVED, AND/OR REIMBURSED MEDICINES AND OTHER PRODUCTS). WE ALSO WORK WITH MCOS, PBMS, EMPLOYERS AND OTHER APPROPRIATE HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS TO ASSIST THEM WITH DISEASE

MANAGEMENT, PATIENT EDUCATION AND OTHER TOOLS THAT HELP THEIR MEDICAL TREATMENT ROUTINES.

OUR ANIMAL HEALTH BUSINESS ALSO USES ITS OWN SALES ORGANIZATION TO PROMOTE ITS PRODUCTS. ITS ADVERTISING AND PROMOTION ARE GENERALLY TARGETED TO HEALTH PROFESSIONALS, DIRECTLY AND THROUGH

VETERINARY JOURNALS. ANIMAL HEALTH PRODUCTS ARE SOLD THROUGH VETERINARIANS, DISTRIBUTORS AND RETAIL OUTLETS AS WELL AS DIRECTLY TO USERS. WHERE APPROPRIATE,

THESE PRODUCTS ARE ALSO MARKETED THROUGH PRINT AND TELEVISION ADVERTISING.

DURING 2007, SALES TO OUR THREE LARGEST WHOLESALERS WERE AS FOLLOWS.

MCKESSON, INC.18% OF OUR TOTAL REVENUES;

CARDINAL HEALTH, INC.12% OF OUR TOTAL

REVENUES; AND

AMERISOURCEBERGEN CORPORATION10% OF OUR

TOTAL REVENUES.

SALES TO THESE WHOLESALERS WERE CONCENTRATED IN THE PHARMACEUTICAL SEGMENT. APART FROM THESE INSTANCES, NEITHER OF OUR BUSINESS SEGMENTS IS DEPENDENT ON ANY ONE CUSTOMER OR GROUP OF RELATED CUSTOMERS.

PATENTS AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS

OUR PRODUCTS ARE SOLD AROUND THE WORLD UNDER BRAND-NAME, LOGO AND CERTAIN PRODUCT DESIGN TRADEMARKS THAT WE CONSIDER IN THE AGGREGATE TO BE OF MATERIAL IMPORTANCE. TRADEMARK PROTECTION

CONTINUES IN SOME COUNTRIES FOR AS LONG AS THE MARK IS USED AND, IN OTHER COUNTRIES, FOR AS LONG AS IT IS REGISTERED. REGISTRATIONS GENERALLY ARE FOR FIXED, BUT RENEWABLE, TERMS.

WE OWN OR LICENSE A NUMBER OF U.S. AND FOREIGN PATENTS. THESE PATENTS COVER PHARMACEUTICAL AND OTHER PRODUCTS AND THEIR USES, PHARMACEUTICAL FORMULATIONS, PRODUCT MANUFACTURING PROCESSES AND

INTERMEDIATE CHEMICAL COMPOUNDS USED IN MANUFACTURING.

PATENTS FOR INDIVIDUAL PRODUCTS EXTEND FOR VARYING PERIODS ACCORDING TO THE DATE OF PATENT FILING OR GRANT AND THE LEGAL TERM OF PATENTS IN THE VARIOUS COUNTRIES WHERE PATENT PROTECTION IS

OBTAINED. THE ACTUAL PROTECTION AFFORDED BY A PATENT, WHICH CAN VARY FROM COUNTRY TO COUNTRY, DEPENDS UPON THE TYPE OF PATENT, THE SCOPE OF ITS COVERAGE AND THE AVAILABILITY OF LEGAL REMEDIES IN THE COUNTRY.

IN THE AGGREGATE, OUR PATENT AND RELATED RIGHTS ARE OF MATERIAL IMPORTANCE TO OUR BUSINESSES IN THE U.S. AND MOST OTHER COUNTRIES. BASED ON CURRENT PRODUCT SALES, AND CONSIDERING THE VIGOROUS

COMPETITION WITH PRODUCTS SOLD BY OTHERS, THE PATENT RIGHTS WE CONSIDER MOST SIGNIFICANT IN RELATION TO OUR BUSINESS AS A WHOLE, TOGETHER WITH THE YEAR IN WHICH THE U.S. BASIC PRODUCT PATENT EXPIRES (INCLUDING, WHERE APPLICABLE, THE ADDITIONAL

SIX-MONTH PEDIATRIC EXCLUSIVITY PERIOD), ARE THOSE FOR THE DRUGS SET FORTH IN THE TABLE BELOW. THE TABLE

ALSO INCLUDES PATENT EXPIRATION INFORMATION RELATING TO CERTAIN RECENTLY APPROVED DRUGS.

IN SOME INSTANCES, THERE ARE LATER-EXPIRING PATENTS RELATING TO OUR PRODUCTS DIRECTED TO PARTICULAR FORMS OR COMPOSITIONS OF THE DRUG OR TO METHODS OF MANUFACTURING OR USING THE DRUG IN THE

TREATMENT OF PARTICULAR DISEASES OR CONDITIONS. HOWEVER, IN SOME CASES, SUCH PATENTS MAY NOT PROTECT THE COMPANYS DRUG FROM GENERIC COMPETITION AFTER THE EXPIRATION OF THE BASIC PATENT.

ARICEPT

IS PATENTED BY EISAI CO., LTD. WE CO-PROMOTE

WITH EISAI IN THE

U.S. AND SEVERAL OTHER COUNTRIES AND HAVE AN EXCLUSIVE LICENSE TO SELL THE DRUG IN CERTAIN OTHER COUNTRIES.

IN ADDITION TO OUR U.S. BASIC PRODUCT PATENT FOR

LIPITOR,

WHICH (INCLUDING THE PEDIATRIC EXCLUSIVITY PERIOD) EXPIRES IN

MARCH 2010, WE HAVE A PATENT COVERING SPECIFICALLY THE ENANTIOMERIC FORM OF THE DRUG, WHICH (INCLUDING THE PEDIATRIC EXCLUSIVITY PERIOD) EXPIRES IN JUNE 2011. SEE NOTE 20 TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS,

. IN ADDITION, A COMPANY HAS FILED AN APPLICATION WITH THE FDA SEEKING APPROVAL TO MARKET A GENERIC VERSION OF

ARICEPT,

WHICH IS PATENTED BY EISAI CO., LTD.

WE ALSO HAVE OTHER PATENT RIGHTS COVERING ADDITIONAL PRODUCTS THAT HAVE LESSER REVENUES THAN MOST OF THE PRODUCTS SET FORTH IN THE TABLE ABOVE.

THE EXPIRATION OF A BASIC PRODUCT PATENT OR LOSS OF PATENT PROTECTION RESULTING FROM A LEGAL CHALLENGE NORMALLY RESULTS IN SIGNIFICANT COMPETITION FROM GENERIC PRODUCTS AGAINST THE ORIGINALLY

PATENTED PRODUCT AND CAN RESULT IN A SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN SALES OF THAT PRODUCT IN A VERY SHORT PERIOD. IN SOME CASES, HOWEVER, WE CAN CONTINUE TO OBTAIN COMMERCIAL BENEFITS FROM PRODUCT MANUFACTURING TRADE SECRETS; PATENTS ON USES FOR PRODUCTS;

PATENTS ON PROCESSES AND INTERMEDIATES FOR THE ECONOMICAL MANUFACTURE OF THE ACTIVE INGREDIENTS; PATENTS FOR SPECIAL FORMULATIONS OF THE PRODUCT OR DELIVERY MECHANISMS; AND CONVERSION OF THE ACTIVE INGREDIENT TO OVER-THE-COUNTER PRODUCTS.

ONE OF THE MAIN LIMITATIONS ON OUR OPERATIONS IN SOME COUNTRIES OUTSIDE THE U.S. IS THE LACK OF EFFECTIVE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY PROTECTION FOR OUR PRODUCTS. UNDER INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS IN

RECENT YEARS, GLOBAL PROTECTION OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS IS IMPROVING. THE GENERAL AGREEMENT ON TARIFFS AND TRADE REQUIRES PARTICIPANT COUNTRIES TO AMEND THEIR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY LAWS TO PROVIDE PATENT PROTECTION FOR PHARMACEUTICAL

PRODUCTS BY THE END OF A TEN-YEAR TRANSITION PERIOD. A NUMBER OF COUNTRIES ARE DOING THIS. WE HAVE EXPERIENCED SIGNIFICANT GROWTH IN OUR BUSINESSES IN SOME OF THOSE NATIONS, AND OUR CONTINUED BUSINESS EXPANSION IN THOSE COUNTRIES DEPENDS TO A LARGE

DEGREE ON FURTHER PATENT PROTECTION IMPROVEMENT.

COMPETITION

OUR BUSINESSES ARE CONDUCTED IN INTENSELY COMPETITIVE AND OFTEN HIGHLY REGULATED MARKETS. MANY OF OUR HUMAN PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS FACE COMPETITION IN THE FORM OF BRANDED DRUGS OR GENERIC

DRUGS THAT TREAT SIMILAR DISEASES OR INDICATIONS. THE PRINCIPAL FORMS OF COMPETITION INCLUDE EFFICACY, SAFETY, EASE OF USE, AND COST EFFECTIVENESS. THOUGH THE MEANS OF COMPETITION VARY AMONG PRODUCT CATEGORIES AND BUSINESS GROUPS, DEMONSTRATING THE

VALUE OF OUR PRODUCTS IS A CRITICAL FACTOR FOR SUCCESS IN ALL OF OUR PRINCIPAL BUSINESSES.

OUR PHARMACEUTICAL BUSINESS IS THE LARGEST IN THE WORLD. OUR COMPETITORS INCLUDE OTHER WORLDWIDE RESEARCH-BASED DRUG COMPANIES,

SMALLER RESEARCH COMPANIES WITH MORE LIMITED THERAPEUTIC FOCUS, AND GENERIC DRUG MANUFACTURERS. WE COMPETE WITH OTHER COMPANIES THAT MANUFACTURE AND SELL PRODUCTS THAT TREAT SIMILAR DISEASES OR INDICATIONS AS OUR MAJOR

PRODUCTS.

SUCH COMPETITION AFFECTS OUR CORE PRODUCT BUSINESS, FOCUSED ON APPLYING INNOVATIVE SCIENCE TO DISCOVER AND MARKET PRODUCTS THAT SATISFY UNMET MEDICAL NEEDS AND PROVIDE THERAPEUTIC IMPROVEMENTS.

OUR EMPHASIS ON INNOVATION IS UNDERSCORED BY OUR MULTI-BILLION-DOLLAR INVESTMENT IN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT OVER THE PAST DECADE, RESULTING IN ONE OF THE STRONGEST PRODUCT PIPELINES IN THE INDUSTRY. OUR INVESTMENT IN RESEARCH DOES NOT STOP WITH A

DRUG APPROVAL; WE CONTINUE TO INVEST IN FURTHER UNDERSTANDING THE VALUE OF OUR PRODUCTS FOR THE CONDITIONS THEY TREAT AS WELL AS POTENTIALLY NEW CONDITIONS. WE PROTECT THE HEALTH AND WELL BEING OF PATIENTS BY ENSURING THAT MEDICALLY SOUND KNOWLEDGE

OF THE BENEFITS AND RISKS OF OUR MEDICINES IS UNDERSTOOD AND COMMUNICATED TO PATIENTS, PHYSICIANS AND GLOBAL HEALTH AUTHORITIES. WE ALSO CONTINUE TO ENHANCE THE ORGANIZATIONAL EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR PHARMACEUTICAL SALES AND MARKETING FUNCTIONS,

COORDINATING SUPPORT FOR OUR SALESPEOPLES EFFORTS TO LAUNCH AND PROMOTE OUR PRODUCTS TO OUR CUSTOMERS.

OPERATING CONDITIONS HAVE BECOME MORE CHALLENGING UNDER THE MOUNTING GLOBAL PRESSURES OF COMPETITION, INDUSTRY REGULATION AND COST CONTAINMENT. WE RECENTLY HAVE TAKEN AND CONTINUE TO TAKE

MEASURES TO EVALUATE, ADAPT, AND IMPROVE OUR ORGANIZATION AND BUSINESS PRACTICES TO BETTER MEET CUSTOMER AND PUBLIC NEEDS.

FOR INSTANCE, WE HAVE TAKEN AN INDUSTRY-LEADING ROLE IN EVOLVING OUR APPROACHES TO U.S. DIRECT-TO-CONSUMER ADVERTISING, INTERACTIONS WITH HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONALS AND MEDICAL EDUCATION GRANTS.

WE ALSO CONTINUE TO SPONSOR PROGRAMS TO ADDRESS PATIENT AFFORDABILITY AND ACCESS BARRIERS, AS WE STRIVE TO ADVANCE FUNDAMENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM CHANGE THROUGH SUPPORT FOR BETTER HEALTHCARE SOLUTIONS.

WHILE OUR ANIMAL HEALTH BUSINESS IS ONE OF THE LARGEST IN THE WORLD, MANY OTHER COMPANIES OFFER COMPETITIVE PRODUCTS. ALTOGETHER, THERE ARE HUNDREDS OF PRODUCERS OF ANIMAL HEALTH PRODUCTS

THROUGHOUT THE WORLD. THE PRINCIPAL METHODS OF COMPETITION VARY SOMEWHAT DEPENDING ON THE PARTICULAR PRODUCT. THEY INCLUDE PRODUCT

8

INNOVATION, QUALITY, PRICE, SERVICE AND EFFECTIVE PROMOTION TO VETERINARY PROFESSIONALS AND CONSUMERS.

MANAGED CARE ORGANIZATIONS

THE GROWTH OF MCOS IN THE U.S. HAS BEEN A MAJOR FACTOR IN THE COMPETITIVE MAKEUP OF THE HEALTHCARE MARKETPLACE. APPROXIMATELY 180 MILLION PEOPLE IN THE U.S. NOW PARTICIPATE IN SOME VERSION OF

MANAGED CARE. BECAUSE OF THE SIZE OF THE PATIENT POPULATION COVERED BY MCOS, MARKETING OF PRESCRIPTION DRUGS TO THEM AND THE PBMS THAT SERVE MANY OF THOSE ORGANIZATIONS CONTINUES TO GROW IN IMPORTANCE.

MCOS CAN INCLUDE MEDICAL INSURANCE COMPANIES, MEDICAL PLAN ADMINISTRATORS, HEALTH-MAINTENANCE ORGANIZATIONS, ALLIANCES OF HOSPITALS AND PHYSICIANS AND OTHER PHYSICIAN ORGANIZATIONS. THE

PURCHASING POWER OF MCOS HAS BEEN INCREASING IN RECENT YEARS DUE TO THEIR GROWING NUMBERS OF ENROLLED PATIENTS. AT THE SAME TIME, THOSE ORGANIZATIONS HAVE BEEN CONSOLIDATING INTO FEWER, EVEN LARGER ENTITIES. THIS ENHANCES THEIR PURCHASING STRENGTH

AND IMPORTANCE TO US.

THE GROWTH OF MCOS HAS INCREASED PRESSURE ON DRUG PRICES. ONE OBJECTIVE OF MCOS IS TO CONTAIN AND, WHERE POSSIBLE, REDUCE HEALTHCARE EXPENDITURES. THEY TYPICALLY USE FORMULARIES, VOLUME

PURCHASES AND LONG-TERM CONTRACTS TO NEGOTIATE DISCOUNTS FROM PHARMACEUTICAL PROVIDERS. THEY USE THEIR PURCHASING POWER TO BARGAIN FOR LOWER SUPPLIER PRICES. THEY ALSO EMPHASIZE PRIMARY AND PREVENTIVE CARE, OUT-PATIENT TREATMENT AND PROCEDURES

PERFORMED AT DOCTORS OFFICES AND CLINICS. HOSPITALIZATION AND SURGERY, TYPICALLY THE MOST EXPENSIVE FORMS OF TREATMENT, ARE CAREFULLY MANAGED. SINCE THE USE OF CERTAIN DRUGS CAN PREVENT THE NEED FOR HOSPITALIZATION, PROFESSIONAL THERAPY OR

EVEN SURGERY, SUCH DRUGS CAN BECOME FAVORED FIRST-LINE TREATMENTS FOR CERTAIN DISEASES.

AS DISCUSSED ABOVE IN

MARKETING

, MCOS AND PBMS TYPICALLY DEVELOP FORMULARIES. FORMULARIES CAN BE BASED ON THE PRICES AND

THERAPEUTIC BENEFITS OF THE AVAILABLE PRODUCTS. DUE TO THEIR GENERALLY LOWER COST, GENERIC MEDICINES ARE OFTEN FAVORED. THE BREADTH OF THE PRODUCTS COVERED BY FORMULARIES CAN VARY CONSIDERABLY FROM ONE MCO TO ANOTHER AND MANY FORMULARIES INCLUDE

ALTERNATIVE AND COMPETITIVE PRODUCTS FOR TREATMENT

OF PARTICULAR MEDICAL PROBLEMS. MCOS USE A VARIETY OF MEANS TO ENCOURAGE PATIENTS USE OF PRODUCTS LISTED ON THEIR FORMULARIES.

EXCLUSION OF A PRODUCT FROM A FORMULARY OR OTHER RESTRICTIONS, SUCH AS REQUIRING PRIOR AUTHORIZATIONS, CAN LEAD TO ITS SHARPLY REDUCED USAGE IN THE MCO PATIENT POPULATION. CONSEQUENTLY,

PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES COMPETE AGGRESSIVELY TO HAVE THEIR PRODUCTS INCLUDED. WHERE POSSIBLE, COMPANIES COMPETE FOR INCLUSION BASED UPON UNIQUE FEATURES OF THEIR PRODUCTS, SUCH AS GREATER EFFICACY, BETTER PATIENT EASE OF USE OR FEWER SIDE EFFECTS.

A LOWER OVERALL COST OF THERAPY IS ALSO AN IMPORTANT FACTOR. PRODUCTS THAT DEMONSTRATE FEWER THERAPEUTIC ADVANTAGES MUST COMPETE FOR INCLUSION BASED PRIMARILY ON PRICE. WE HAVE BEEN GENERALLY, ALTHOUGH NOT UNIVERSALLY, SUCCESSFUL IN HAVING OUR MAJOR

PRODUCTS INCLUDED ON MOST MCO FORMULARIES.

THE IMPACT OF MCOS ON DRUG PRICES AND VOLUMES HAS INCREASED AS THE RESULT OF THEIR ROLE IN NEGOTIATING ON BEHALF OF MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES IN CONNECTION WITH THE MEDICARE OUT-PATIENT

PRESCRIPTION DRUG BENEFIT, MEDICARE PART D THAT TOOK EFFECT JANUARY 1, 2006. MCOS AND PBMS NEGOTIATE ON BEHALF OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AS PRESCRIPTION DRUG PLANS (PDPS). WE HAVE BEEN GENERALLY, ALTHOUGH NOT UNIVERSALLY, SUCCESSFUL IN HAVING OUR

MAJOR PRODUCTS THAT ARE USED BY THE SENIOR POPULATION INCLUDED ON THE FORMULARIES OF THE NEW MEDICARE PDPS FOR 2006, 2007 AND 2008.

GENERIC PRODUCTS

ONE OF THE BIGGEST COMPETITIVE CHALLENGES THAT WE FACE IS FROM GENERIC PHARMACEUTICAL MANUFACTURERS. UPON THE EXPIRATION OR LOSS OF PATENT PROTECTION FOR A PRODUCT, WE CAN LOSE THE MAJOR

PORTION OF SALES OF THAT PRODUCT IN A VERY SHORT PERIOD. SEVERAL SUCH COMPETITORS MAKE A REGULAR PRACTICE OF CHALLENGING OUR PRODUCT PATENTS BEFORE THEIR EXPIRY. GENERIC COMPETITORS OPERATE WITHOUT OUR LARGE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES AND OUR

COSTS OF CONVEYING MEDICAL INFORMATION ABOUT OUR PRODUCTS TO THE MEDICAL COMMUNITY. IN ADDITION, THE FDA APPROVAL PROCESS EXEMPTS GENERICS FROM COSTLY AND TIME-CONSUMING CLINICAL TRIALS TO DEMONSTRATE THEIR SAFETY AND EFFICACY, ALLOWING GENERIC

MANUFACTURERS TO RELY ON THE SAFETY AND EFFICACY DATA OF THE INNOVATOR PRODUCT. GENERIC PRODUCTS NEED ONLY DEMONSTRATE A LEVEL OF AVAILABILITY IN THE BLOODSTREAM EQUIVALENT

9

TO THAT OF THE INNOVATOR PRODUCT. THIS MEANS THAT GENERIC COMPETITORS CAN MARKET A COMPETING VERSION OF OUR PRODUCT AFTER THE EXPIRATION OR LOSS OF OUR PATENT AND CHARGE MUCH LESS.

IN ADDITION, OUR PATENT-PROTECTED PRODUCTS CAN FACE COMPETITION IN THE FORM OF GENERIC VERSIONS OF BRANDED PRODUCTS OF COMPETITORS THAT LOSE THEIR MARKET EXCLUSIVITY. FOR EXAMPLE,

LIPITOR

BEGAN TO FACE COMPETITION FROM GENERIC PRAVASTATIN (PRAVACHOL) AND GENERIC SIMVASTATIN (ZOCOR) DURING 2006.

AS NOTED ABOVE, MCOS THAT FOCUS PRIMARILY ON THE IMMEDIATE COST OF DRUGS OFTEN FAVOR GENERICS OVER BRAND-NAME DRUGS. MANY GOVERNMENTS ALSO ENCOURAGE THE USE OF GENERICS AS ALTERNATIVES TO

BRAND-NAME DRUGS IN THEIR HEALTHCARE PROGRAMS, INCLUDING MEDICAID IN THE U.S. LAWS IN THE U.S. GENERALLY ALLOW, AND IN SOME CASES REQUIRE, PHARMACISTS TO SUBSTITUTE GENERIC DRUGS THAT HAVE BEEN RATED UNDER GOVERNMENT PROCEDURES TO BE THERAPEUTICALLY

EQUIVALENT TO BRAND-NAME DRUGS. THE SUBSTITUTION MUST BE MADE UNLESS THE PRESCRIBING PHYSICIAN EXPRESSLY FORBIDS IT. IN THE U.S., PFIZERS GREENSTONE SUBSIDIARY SELLS GENERIC VERSIONS OF PFIZERS PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS UPON LOSS OF

EXCLUSIVITY, AS APPROPRIATE.

RAW MATERIALS

RAW MATERIALS ESSENTIAL TO OUR BUSINESSES ARE PURCHASED WORLDWIDE IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS FROM NUMEROUS SUPPLIERS. IN GENERAL, THESE MATERIALS ARE AVAILABLE FROM MULTIPLE SOURCES. NO

SERIOUS SHORTAGES OR DELAYS WERE ENCOUNTERED IN 2007, AND NONE ARE EXPECTED IN 2008. THE RISE IN THE PRICE OF CRUDE OIL HAS RESULTED IN PRICING PRESSURES ON RAW MATERIALS THAT ARE DERIVED FROM PETROLEUM AND USED IN OUR BUSINESSES.

GOVERNMENT REGULATION AND PRICE CONSTRAINTS

IN THE UNITED STATES

GENERAL.

PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES ARE SUBJECT TO EXTENSIVE REGULATION BY NATIONAL, STATE AND LOCAL AGENCIES IN THE COUNTRIES IN WHICH THEY DO BUSINESS.

OF PARTICULAR IMPORTANCE IS THE FDA IN THE U.S. IT HAS JURISDICTION OVER OUR HUMAN PHARMACEUTICAL BUSINESS AND ADMINISTERS

REQUIREMENTS COVERING THE TESTING, SAFETY, EFFECTIVENESS, MANUFACTURING, LABELING, MARKETING, ADVERTISING AND POST-MARKETING SURVEILLANCE OF OUR PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS. THE FDA ALSO REGULATES OUR ANIMAL HEALTH PRODUCTS,

ALONG WITH THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE AND THE U.S. ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY.

IN ADDITION, MANY OF OUR ACTIVITIES ARE SUBJECT TO THE JURISDICTION OF VARIOUS OTHER FEDERAL REGULATORY AND ENFORCEMENT DEPARTMENTS AND AGENCIES, SUCH AS THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN

SERVICES, THE FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION AND THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE. INDIVIDUAL STATES, ACTING THROUGH THEIR ATTORNEYS GENERAL, HAVE BECOME ACTIVE AS WELL, SEEKING TO REGULATE THE MARKETING OF PRESCRIPTION DRUGS UNDER STATE CONSUMER PROTECTION AND

FALSE ADVERTISING LAWS.

WE ARE SUBJECT TO POSSIBLE ADMINISTRATIVE AND LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND ACTIONS BY THESE VARIOUS REGULATORY BODIES (SEE NOTE 20 TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS,

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND CONTINGENCIES,

IN OUR 2007 FINANCIAL REPORT). SUCH ACTIONS MAY INCLUDE PRODUCT RECALLS, SEIZURES AND OTHER CIVIL AND CRIMINAL SANCTIONS.

THE U.S. CONGRESS AND THE FDA ARE CONSIDERING PROPOSALS TO CHANGE HOW THE FDA ASSESSES FOLLOW-ON BIOLOGICAL PRODUCTS. DEPENDING ON THE SPECIFIC PROVISIONS, LEGISLATIVE OR REGULATORY

CHANGES THAT WOULD FACILITATE THE APPROVAL OF SUCH PRODUCTS COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON THE COMPANYS BUSINESS.

MEDICARE.

IN DECEMBER 2003, THE MEDICARE PRESCRIPTION DRUG IMPROVEMENT AND MODERNIZATION ACT OF 2003 (THE 2003 MEDICARE ACT) WAS ENACTED. MEDICARE

BENEFICIARIES ARE NOW ELIGIBLE TO OBTAIN SUBSIDIZED PRESCRIPTION DRUG COVERAGE FROM A CHOICE OF PRIVATE SECTOR PLANS. OVER 90 PERCENT OF MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES NOW HAVE COVERAGE FOR PRESCRIPTION MEDICINES. IT REMAINS DIFFICULT TO PREDICT THE

LONG-TERM IMPACT OF THE 2003 MEDICARE ACT ON PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES. THE USE OF PHARMACEUTICALS HAS INCREASED SLIGHTLY AMONG SOME PATIENTS AS THE RESULT OF THE EXPANDED ACCESS TO MEDICINES AFFORDED BY COVERAGE UNDER MEDICARE. HOWEVER, SUCH

EXPANDED UTILIZATION HAS BEEN LARGELY OFFSET BY INCREASED PRICING PRESSURE AND COMPETITION DUE TO THE ENHANCED PURCHASING POWER OF THE PRIVATE SECTOR PLANS THAT NEGOTIATE ON BEHALF OF MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES AND BY AN INCREASE IN THE USE

OF

10

GENERIC MEDICINES IN THIS POPULATION. IN ADDITION, EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2007, MEDICARE ENDED REIMBURSEMENT FOR ED MEDICINES, INCLUDING

VIAGRA.

PFIZER IS COMMITTED TO HELPING ENSURE THAT ALL AMERICANS WITHOUT COVERAGE FOR PRESCRIPTION MEDICINES HAVE ACCESS TO PFIZER PRODUCTS. TO THAT END, IN 2004, WE IMPLEMENTED OUR HELPFUL ANSWERS

PROGRAM, AN UMBRELLA PROGRAM THAT BRINGS TOGETHER PFIZERS LONG-STANDING PATIENT ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS WITH PFIZER PFRIENDS, A PRESCRIPTION DISCOUNT CARD OFFERING SAVINGS ON PFIZER PRESCRIPTION MEDICINES FOR ALL AMERICANS WITHOUT PRESCRIPTION

DRUG COVERAGE, REGARDLESS OF AGE OR INCOME. IN ADDITION, IN JANUARY 2005, WE JOINED TOGETHER RX ACCESS WITH NINE OTHER PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES TO OFFER SAVINGS ON OVER 275 MEDICINES TO MEDICARE-INELIGIBLE, UNINSURED INDIVIDUALS UNDER 65 WHO FALL

BELOW CERTAIN INCOME THRESHOLDS. PFIZER ALSO PARTICIPATES IN THE PARTNERSHIP FOR PRESCRIPTION ASSISTANCE, A SINGLE POINT OF ACCESS TO MORE THAN 475 PUBLIC AND PRIVATE PATIENT ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS.

IMPORTATION OF DRUGS.

THERE CONTINUE TO BE LEGISLATIVE PROPOSALS TO AMEND U.S. LAW TO ALLOW THE IMPORTATION INTO THE U.S. OF PRESCRIPTION DRUGS FROM

OUTSIDE THE U.S., WHICH CAN BE SOLD AT PRICES THAT ARE REGULATED BY THE GOVERNMENTS OF VARIOUS FOREIGN COUNTRIES. IN ADDITION TO WELL DOCUMENTED SAFETY CONCERNS, SUCH IMPORTATION COULD IMPACT PHARMACEUTICAL PRICES IN THE U.S. WHILE THE 2003 MEDICARE

ACT MAINTAINS THE CURRENT PROHIBITION ON SUCH IMPORTS, IT WOULD ALLOW IMPORTATION FROM CANADA IF THE SECRETARY OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES CERTIFIES THAT SUCH IMPORTATION IS SAFE AND WOULD RESULT IN SAVINGS TO CONSUMERS. BEFORE THE 2003 MEDICARE

ACT, FEDERAL LAW WOULD HAVE PERMITTED IMPORTATION OF MEDICINES INTO THE U.S. FROM A CONSIDERABLY LARGER GROUP OF DEVELOPED COUNTRIES, PROVIDED THE SECRETARY OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES MADE THE SAME SAFETY AND COST-SAVINGS CERTIFICATIONS. IN

DECEMBER 2004, THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES (HHS) AND THE DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE ISSUED REPORTS ON DRUG IMPORTATION AND FOREIGN PRICE CONTROLS. THE HHS REPORT NOTED THAT IT WOULD BE EXTRAORDINARILY DIFFICULT TO ENSURE THAT DRUGS

PERSONALLY IMPORTED BY INDIVIDUAL CONSUMERS COULD MEET THE STANDARDS OF SAFETY THAT WOULD SUPPORT CERTIFYING SUCH IMPORTATION AS SAFE. WHILE THE REPORT ALSO CONCLUDED THAT THE U.S. COULD

ESTABLISH A FEASIBLE BASIS FOR COMMERCIAL DRUG IMPORTATION, SUCH A CHANGE IN THE LAW WOULD REQUIRE NEW LEGAL AUTHORITIES, SUBSTANTIAL ADDITIONAL RESOURCES AND SIGNIFICANT RESTRICTIONS ON THE TYPES OF DRUGS THAT COULD

BE IMPORTED. THE REPORT ALSO NOTED THAT THE TOTAL SAVINGS TO BE EXPECTED FROM SUCH A COMMERCIAL IMPORTATION REGIME WOULD BE RELATIVELY SMALL  1% OR 2% OF TOTAL DRUG SPENDING IN THE U.S. THE COMMERCE DEPARTMENT REPORT CONFIRMED THAT THE

LOWER PRICES IN MANY COUNTRIES RESULT FROM GOVERNMENTAL PRICE CONTROLS, AND THESE PRICE CONTROLS ADVERSELY AFFECT THE AMOUNT OF FUNDING THAT IS AVAILABLE FOR THE DISCOVERY OF NEW DRUGS.

MEDICAID AND RELATED MATTERS.

FEDERAL LAW REQUIRES US TO GIVE REBATES TO STATE MEDICAID AGENCIES BASED ON EACH STATES REIMBURSEMENT OF

PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS UNDER THE MEDICAID PROGRAM. IN RECENT YEARS, VARIOUS PROPOSALS HAVE BEEN OFFERED AT THE FEDERAL AND STATE LEVELS THAT WOULD BRING ABOUT MAJOR CHANGES IN THE MEDICAID PROGRAM. IN THE SHORT TERM, DRIVEN BY BUDGET CONCERNS, MANY

STATES HAVE IMPLEMENTED RESTRICTIVE DRUG LISTS AND STATE SUPPLEMENTAL REBATE PROGRAMS UNDER THE MEDICAID PROGRAM. THESE PROGRAMS INCREASED OUR REQUIRED REBATE PAYMENTS IN 2007. NONETHELESS, PFIZER ENJOYS RELATIVELY BROAD FORMULARY ACCESS IN STATE

MEDICAID FEE-FOR-SERVICE PROGRAMS, ALTHOUGH RESTRICTIONS EXIST FOR SOME PRODUCTS IN CERTAIN STATES. ACCESS IN THE MEDICAID MANAGED CARE PROGRAM IS TYPICALLY DETERMINED BY THE HEALTH PLANS PROVIDING COVERAGE FOR MEDICAID RECIPIENTS CONTRACTING FOR

THE PROVISION OF SERVICES IN THE STATE. ACCESS MAY VARY BY PLAN.

SINCE JANUARY 1, 2006, FEDERAL FUNDS HAVE NOT BEEN USED FOR REIMBURSEMENT OF ERECTILE DYSFUNCTION MEDICATIONS, INCLUDING

VIAGRA,

IN THE MEDICAID PROGRAM. IN ADDITION, EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2007, CHANGES TO THE TREATMENT OF AUTHORIZED GENERICS FOR PURPOSES OF CALCULATING MEDICAID REBATES INCREASED THE AMOUNT OF REBATES WE ARE REQUIRED TO PAY ON BRAND NAME DRUG

SALES AFTER LOSS OF EXCLUSIVITY AND ON AUTHORIZED GENERIC SALES TO THE MEDICAID PROGRAM. IN ADDITION, A NUMBER OF STATES ARE CONSIDERING EXPANSION OF ELIGIBILITY FOR THEIR MEDICAID PROGRAMS THAT WOULD RESULT IN INCREASED EXPOSURE TO MEDICAID

REBATES.

SOME STATES ARE CONSIDERING PRICE-CONTROL REGIMES THAT WOULD APPLY TO BROADER SEGMENTS OF THEIR POPULATIONS THAT ARE NOT MEDICAID ELIGIBLE, AS

11

WELL AS VARIOUS APPROACHES TO CONTROLLING PHARMACEUTICAL MARKETING ACTIVITIES. IF MANY STATES WERE TO REQUIRE INCREASED REBATE PAYMENTS IN DISCOUNT PROGRAMS FOR THE UNINSURED AND LINK MEDICAID BENEFICIARIES ACCESS TO

OUR PRODUCTS TO SUCH DISCOUNT PROGRAMS, THE IMPACT ON PATIENTS ACCESS TO MEDICINES AND ON PFIZER COULD BE SIGNIFICANT.

WE ALSO MUST GIVE DISCOUNTS OR REBATES ON PURCHASES OR REIMBURSEMENTS OF PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS BY CERTAIN OTHER FEDERAL AND STATE AGENCIES AND PROGRAMS. SEE THE DISCUSSION REGARDING REBATES

IN THE

REVENUES

SECTION OF OUR 2007 FINANCIAL REPORT AND IN NOTE 1-G TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS,

SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING

POLICIES, REVENUES,

IN OUR 2007 FINANCIAL REPORT, WHICH DISCUSSIONS ARE INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE.

HEALTH REFORM.

MASSACHUSETTS IS CURRENTLY IMPLEMENTING ITS PROGRAM FOR HEALTH REFORM. PART OF THE ONGOING IMPLEMENTATION DISCUSSION IS WHETHER MINIMAL

COVERAGE REQUIRES ACCESS TO BRAND-NAME MEDICATIONS OR ONLY TO GENERIC MEDICATIONS. THE LATTER APPROACH HAS THE POTENTIAL TO HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON THE SALE OF BRAND-NAME MEDICATIONS. THIS IMPACT WOULD BE MORE SIGNIFICANT IF GENERICS-ONLY PROGRAMS

WERE IMPLEMENTED BY OTHER STATES CONSIDERING THEIR OWN APPROACHES TO HEALTH REFORM.

OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES

WE ENCOUNTER SIMILAR REGULATORY AND LEGISLATIVE ISSUES IN MOST OTHER COUNTRIES. IN EUROPE AND SOME OTHER INTERNATIONAL MARKETS, THE GOVERNMENT PROVIDES HEALTHCARE AT LOW DIRECT COST TO

CONSUMERS AND REGULATES PHARMACEUTICAL PRICES OR PATIENT REIMBURSEMENT LEVELS TO CONTROL COSTS FOR THE GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED HEALTHCARE SYSTEM. THIS INTERNATIONAL PATCHWORK OF PRICE REGULATION HAS LED TO DIFFERENT PRICES AND SOME THIRD-PARTY TRADE IN

OUR PRODUCTS FROM MARKETS WITH LOWER PRICES. SUCH TRADE EXPLOITING PRICE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN COUNTRIES CAN UNDERMINE OUR SALES IN MARKETS WITH HIGHER PRICES.

THE APPROVAL OF NEW DRUGS ACROSS THE EU MAY ONLY BE ACHIEVED USING THE MUTUAL RECOGNITION PROCEDURE/DECENTRALIZED PROCEDURE OR EU COMMISSION/EUROPEAN MEDICINES AGENCY (EMEA) CENTRAL APPROVAL

PROCESS, WHICH APPLIES IN THE 27 EU MEMBER STATES, PLUS NORWAY AND

ICELAND, WHICH ARE FULL PARTICIPANTS IN THESE REGISTRATION PROCESSES. THE USE OF THESE PROCEDURES PROVIDES A MORE RAPID AND CONSISTENT APPROVAL ACROSS THE MEMBER STATES THAN WAS THE CASE WHEN THE APPROVAL PROCESSES WERE

OPERATING INDEPENDENTLY WITHIN EACH COUNTRY.

SINCE THE EU DOES NOT HAVE JURISDICTION OVER PATIENT REIMBURSEMENT OR PRICING MATTERS IN ITS MEMBER STATES, WE CONTINUE TO DEAL WITH INDIVIDUAL COUNTRIES ON SUCH MATTERS ACROSS THE

REGION.

DURING 2004, A COMPREHENSIVE PACKAGE OF REFORMS WAS ADOPTED (CALLED NEW MEDICINES LEGISLATION) AMENDING EU LAW ON THE REGULATION OF MEDICINAL PRODUCTS IN MANY AREAS, INCLUDING APPROVAL

PROCEDURES AND SAFETY REPORTING. OF PARTICULAR NOTE, THE DATA EXCLUSIVITY PERIODS DURING WHICH INNOVATIVE COMPANIES REGULATORY DATA ARE PROTECTED ARE REQUIRED TO BE HARMONIZED IN ALL MEMBER STATES. IMPLEMENTATION IS COMPLETE OR UNDERWAY IN

MOST MEMBER STATES, WHICH WILL FACILITATE THE APPROVAL AND LAUNCH OF GENERIC MEDICINES. IN ADDITION, THESE REFORMS INTRODUCED A CLEAR LEGAL BASIS FOR THE APPROVAL OF BIOSIMILAR OR FOLLOW-ON BIOLOGICAL PRODUCTS IN THE EU.

FOLLOWING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THESE NEW REGULATIONS (IN NOVEMBER 2005), THE FIRST SUCH PRODUCTS, INCLUDING A BIOSIMILAR VERSION OF

GENOTROPIN

, WERE APPROVED IN THE EU IN 2006.

THE NEW REGULATIONS ALSO SHORTENED CERTAIN APPROVAL TIMELINES AND INTRODUCED FAST-TRACK AND CONDITIONAL CENTRALIZED AUTHORIZATIONS. PFIZERS

SUTENT

WAS THE FIRST PRODUCT

TO BE CONDITIONALLY APPROVED UNDER THE NEW LAW IN 2006 (ALTHOUGH ITS STATUS SUBSEQUENTLY WAS CONVERTED TO FULL AUTHORIZATION).

ON JANUARY 26, 2007, THE NEW EU REGULATION ON MEDICINES FOR PEDIATRIC USE BECAME EFFECTIVE. THIS INTRODUCED NEW OBLIGATIONS ON PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES TO CONDUCT RESEARCH ON THEIR MEDICINES IN

CHILDREN AND, SUBJECT TO VARIOUS CONDITIONS, OFFERS THE POSSIBILITY OF INCENTIVES FOR SO DOING, INCLUDING EXCLUSIVITY EXTENSIONS. THE AIM OF THIS NEW REGULATION IS TO IMPROVE THE HEALTH OF CHILDREN IN THE EU THROUGH HIGH QUALITY RESEARCH,

STIMULATING THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW MEDICINES, CREATING INFRASTRUCTURE TO ENABLE AUTHORIZED USE AND IMPROVING THE INFORMATION ON MEDICINES FOR CHILDREN. A PEDIATRIC COMMITTEE (PDCO) WAS CREATED WITHIN THE EMEA TO PROVIDE SCIENTIFIC OPINIONS AND INPUT

ON DEVELOPMENT PLANS FOR MEDICINES FOR USE WITH CHILDREN.

12

ON NOVEMBER 28, 2007,

THE EU COMMISSION HOSTED THE TRANSATLANTIC ADMINISTRATIVE SIMPLIFICATION WORKSHOP

CO-CHAIRED BY THE EU COMMISSION AND THE FDA, IN CO-OPERATION WITH THE EMEA AND

THE HEADS  OF EUROPEAN MEDICINES AGENCIES, TO IDENTIFY OPPORTUNITIES FOR ADMINISTRATIVE

SIMPLIFICATION BETWEEN THE U.S. AND THE EU IN THE FIELD OF PHARMACEUTICAL REGULATION.

THESE OPPORTUNITIES INCLUDE POSSIBLE HARMONIZATION OF ADMINISTRATIVE PRACTICES

AND  GUIDELINES, NOT NECESSITATING CHANGES IN REGULATIONS, WHILE MAINTAINING

OR INCREASING THE CURRENT LEVELS OF PUBLIC HEALTH PROTECTION. BY FREEING UP RESOURCES,

THIS COOPERATION WILL ALLOW THE INDUSTRY TO FOCUS MORE OF ITS RESOURCES ON DEVELOPING

AND  SUPPLYING MEDICINES TO MEET THE NEEDS OF PATIENTS.

ENVIRONMENTAL LAW COMPLIANCE

MOST OF OUR OPERATIONS ARE AFFECTED BY FEDERAL, STATE AND/OR LOCAL ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS. WE HAVE MADE, AND INTEND TO CONTINUE TO MAKE, NECESSARY EXPENDITURES FOR COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE LAWS.

WE ALSO ARE CLEANING UP ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINATION FROM PAST INDUSTRIAL ACTIVITY AT CERTAIN SITES (SEE NOTE 20 TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS,

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND CONTINGENCIES,

IN OUR 2007 FINANCIAL REPORT).

AS A RESULT, WE INCURRED CAPITAL AND OPERATIONAL EXPENDITURES IN 2007 FOR ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLIANCE PURPOSES AND FOR THE CLEAN-UP OF CERTAIN PAST INDUSTRIAL ACTIVITY AS FOLLOWS.

ENVIRONMENT-RELATED CAPITAL EXPENDITURES 

$64 MILLION

OTHER ENVIRONMENT-RELATED EXPENSES 

$178 MILLION

WHILE WE CANNOT PREDICT WITH CERTAINTY FUTURE

CAPITAL EXPENDITURES OR OPERATING COSTS FOR ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLIANCE, WE DO NOT BELIEVE THEY WILL HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON OUR CAPITAL EXPENDITURES OR COMPETITIVE POSITION.

TAX MATTERS

FINANCIAL REPORT, IS INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE.

EMPLOYEES

IN OUR INNOVATION-INTENSIVE BUSINESS, OUR EMPLOYEES ARE VITAL TO OUR SUCCESS. WE BELIEVE WE HAVE GOOD RELATIONSHIPS WITH OUR EMPLOYEES. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2007, WE EMPLOYED APPROXIMATELY 86,600

PEOPLE IN OUR OPERATIONS THROUGHOUT THE WORLD.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS AND CAUTIONARY FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT FUTURE RESULTS

THE STATEMENTS IN THIS SECTION DESCRIBE THE MAJOR RISKS TO OUR BUSINESS AND SHOULD BE CONSIDERED CAREFULLY. IN ADDITION, THESE STATEMENTS CONSTITUTE OUR CAUTIONARY STATEMENTS UNDER THE PRIVATE

SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995.

OUR DISCLOSURE AND ANALYSIS IN THIS 2007 FORM 10-K AND IN OUR 2007 ANNUAL REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS CONTAIN SOME FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS THAT SET FORTH ANTICIPATED RESULTS BASED ON

MANAGEMENTS PLANS AND ASSUMPTIONS. FROM TIME TO TIME, WE ALSO PROVIDE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS IN OTHER MATERIALS WE RELEASE TO THE PUBLIC, AS WELL AS ORAL FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS. SUCH STATEMENTS GIVE OUR CURRENT EXPECTATIONS OR

FORECASTS OF FUTURE EVENTS; THEY DO NOT RELATE STRICTLY TO HISTORICAL OR CURRENT FACTS. WE HAVE TRIED, WHEREVER POSSIBLE, TO IDENTIFY SUCH STATEMENTS BY USING WORDS SUCH AS ANTICIPATE, ESTIMATE, EXPECT,

PROJECT, INTEND, PLAN, BELIEVE, WILL, TARGET, FORECAST AND SIMILAR EXPRESSIONS IN CONNECTION WITH ANY DISCUSSION OF FUTURE OPERATING OR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE OR

EFFORTS, EXPENSES, INTEREST RATES, FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES, THE OUTCOME OF CONTINGENCIES, SUCH AS LEGAL PROCEEDINGS, AND FINANCIAL RESULTS.

WE CANNOT GUARANTEE THAT ANY FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENT WILL BE REALIZED, ALTHOUGH WE BELIEVE WE HAVE BEEN PRUDENT IN OUR PLANS AND ASSUMPTIONS. ACHIEVEMENT OF FUTURE RESULTS IS SUBJECT TO

RISKS, UNCERTAINTIES AND POTENTIALLY INACCURATE ASSUMPTIONS. SHOULD KNOWN OR UNKNOWN RISKS OR UNCERTAINTIES MATERIALIZE, OR SHOULD UNDERLYING ASSUMPTIONS PROVE INACCURATE, ACTUAL RESULTS COULD

13

DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM PAST RESULTS AND THOSE ANTICIPATED, ESTIMATED OR PROJECTED. YOU SHOULD BEAR THIS IN MIND AS YOU CONSIDER FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS.

WE UNDERTAKE NO OBLIGATION TO PUBLICLY UPDATE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS, WHETHER AS A RESULT OF NEW INFORMATION, FUTURE EVENTS OR OTHERWISE. YOU ARE ADVISED, HOWEVER, TO CONSULT ANY FURTHER

DISCLOSURES WE MAKE ON RELATED SUBJECTS IN OUR 10-Q AND 8-K REPORTS TO THE SEC. ALSO NOTE THAT WE PROVIDE THE FOLLOWING CAUTIONARY DISCUSSION OF RISKS, UNCERTAINTIES AND POSSIBLY INACCURATE ASSUMPTIONS RELEVANT TO OUR BUSINESSES. THESE ARE FACTORS

THAT, INDIVIDUALLY OR IN THE AGGREGATE, WE THINK COULD CAUSE OUR ACTUAL RESULTS TO DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM EXPECTED AND HISTORICAL RESULTS. WE NOTE THESE FACTORS FOR INVESTORS AS PERMITTED BY THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995. YOU

SHOULD UNDERSTAND THAT IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO PREDICT OR IDENTIFY ALL SUCH FACTORS. CONSEQUENTLY, YOU SHOULD NOT CONSIDER THE FOLLOWING TO BE A COMPLETE DISCUSSION OF ALL POTENTIAL RISKS OR UNCERTAINTIES.

GOVERNMENT REGULATION AND MANAGED CARE TRENDS

U.S. AND FOREIGN GOVERNMENTAL REGULATIONS MANDATING PRICE CONTROLS AND LIMITATIONS ON PATIENT ACCESS TO OUR PRODUCTS IMPACT OUR BUSINESS, AND OUR FUTURE RESULTS COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY

CHANGES IN SUCH REGULATIONS. IN THE U.S., MANY OF OUR PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS ARE SUBJECT TO INCREASING PRICING PRESSURES. SUCH PRESSURES HAVE INCREASED AS THE RESULT OF THE 2003 MEDICARE ACT DUE TO THE ENHANCED PURCHASING POWER OF THE PRIVATE

SECTOR PLANS THAT NEGOTIATE ON BEHALF OF MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES. IN ADDITION, IF THE 2003 MEDICARE ACT WERE AMENDED TO IMPOSE DIRECT GOVERNMENTAL PRICE CONTROLS AND ACCESS RESTRICTIONS, IT WOULD HAVE A SIGNIFICANT ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR BUSINESS. IN

ADDITION, MCOS, AS WELL AS MEDICAID AND OTHER GOVERNMENT AGENCIES, CONTINUE TO SEEK PRICE DISCOUNTS. SOME STATES HAVE IMPLEMENTED AND OTHER STATES ARE CONSIDERING PRICE CONTROLS OR PATIENT-ACCESS CONSTRAINTS UNDER THE MEDICAID PROGRAM AND SOME

STATES ARE CONSIDERING PRICE-CONTROL REGIMES THAT WOULD APPLY TO BROADER SEGMENTS OF THEIR POPULATIONS THAT ARE NOT MEDICAID ELIGIBLE. OTHER MATTERS ALSO COULD BE THE SUBJECT OF U.S. FEDERAL OR STATE LEGISLATIVE OR

REGULATORY ACTION THAT COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, INCLUDING CHANGES IN PATENT LAWS, THE IMPORTATION OF PRESCRIPTION DRUGS FROM OUTSIDE THE U.S. AT PRICES THAT ARE REGULATED BY THE GOVERNMENTS OF VARIOUS FOREIGN

COUNTRIES AND RESTRICTIONS ON U.S. DIRECT-TO- CONSUMER ADVERTISING OR LIMITATIONS ON INTERACTIONS WITH HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONALS.

THE PROHIBITION ON THE USE OF FEDERAL FUNDS FOR REIMBURSEMENT OF ED MEDICATIONS BY THE MEDICAID PROGRAM, WHICH BECAME EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2006, AND THE SIMILAR FEDERAL FUNDING PROHIBITION FOR

THE MEDICARE PROGRAM, WHICH BECAME EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2007, HAS HAD AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS. ANY PROHIBITIONS ON THE USE OF FEDERAL FUNDS FOR REIMBURSEMENT OF OTHER CLASSES OF DRUGS IN THE FUTURE MAY ALSO HAVE AN ADVERSE

EFFECT.

WE ENCOUNTER SIMILAR REGULATORY AND LEGISLATIVE ISSUES IN MOST OTHER COUNTRIES. IN EUROPE AND SOME OTHER INTERNATIONAL MARKETS, THE GOVERNMENT PROVIDES HEALTHCARE AT LOW DIRECT COST TO

CONSUMERS AND REGULATES PHARMACEUTICAL PRICES OR PATIENT REIMBURSEMENT LEVELS TO CONTROL COSTS FOR THE GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED HEALTHCARE SYSTEM. THIS INTERNATIONAL PATCHWORK OF PRICE REGULATION HAS LED TO DIFFERENT PRICES AND SOME THIRD-PARTY TRADE IN

OUR PRODUCTS FROM MARKETS WITH LOWER PRICES. SUCH TRADE EXPLOITING PRICE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN COUNTRIES CAN UNDERMINE OUR SALES IN MARKETS WITH HIGHER PRICES. AS A RESULT, IT IS EXPECTED THAT PRESSURES ON THE PRICING COMPONENT OF OPERATING RESULTS

WILL CONTINUE.

GENERIC COMPETITION

COMPETITION FROM MANUFACTURERS OF GENERIC DRUGS IS A MAJOR CHALLENGE FOR US AROUND THE WORLD. UPON THE EXPIRATION OR LOSS OF PATENT PROTECTION FOR ONE OF OUR PRODUCTS, OR UPON THE

AT-RISK LAUNCH (DESPITE PENDING PATENT INFRINGEMENT LITIGATION AGAINST THE GENERIC PRODUCT) BY A GENERIC MANUFACTURER OF A GENERIC VERSION OF ONE OF OUR PRODUCTS, WE CAN LOSE THE MAJOR PORTION OF SALES OF THAT PRODUCT IN A VERY SHORT

PERIOD, WHICH CAN ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS. THE U.S. BASIC PATENT FOR

NORVASC

EXPIRED IN 2007 AND A GENERIC VERSION WAS LAUNCHED PROMPTLY. THE U.S. BASIC PATENT FOR

ZYRTEC/ZYRTEC D

EXPIRED IN DECEMBER 2007 AND AN OVER-THE-COUNTER VERSION WAS LAUNCHED IN LATE JANUARY 2008 BY THE PURCHASER OF

14

OUR CONSUMER HEALTHCARE BUSINESS. THE U.S. BASIC PATENT FOR

CAMPTOSAR

EXPIRED IN FEBRUARY 2008. ALSO, THE PATENTS COVERING SEVERAL OF OUR MOST

IMPORTANT MEDICINES, INCLUDING

LIPITOR, CELEBREX, DETROL/DETROL LA, CADUET

AND

ARICEPT,

ARE BEING

CHALLENGED BY GENERIC MANUFACTURERS. IN ADDITION, OUR PATENT-PROTECTED PRODUCTS MAY FACE COMPETITION IN THE FORM OF GENERIC VERSIONS OF BRANDED PRODUCTS OF COMPETITORS THAT LOSE THEIR MARKET EXCLUSIVITY. FOR EXAMPLE,

LIPITOR

BEGAN TO FACE COMPETITION FROM GENERIC PRAVASTATIN (PRAVACHOL) AND GENERIC SIMVASTATIN (ZOCOR) DURING 2006.

COMPETITIVE PRODUCTS

WE CANNOT PREDICT WITH ACCURACY THE TIMING OR IMPACT OF THE INTRODUCTION OF COMPETITIVE PRODUCTS OR THEIR POSSIBLE EFFECT ON OUR SALES. PRODUCTS THAT COMPETE WITH OUR DRUGS, INCLUDING SOME OF

OUR BEST-SELLING MEDICINES, ARE LAUNCHED FROM TIME TO TIME. LAUNCHES OF A NUMBER OF COMPETITIVE PRODUCTS HAVE OCCURRED IN RECENT YEARS, AND CERTAIN POTENTIALLY COMPETITIVE PRODUCTS ARE IN VARIOUS STAGES OF DEVELOPMENT, SOME OF WHICH HAVE BEEN FILED

FOR APPROVAL WITH THE FDA AND WITH REGULATORY AUTHORITIES IN OTHER COUNTRIES.

DEPENDENCE ON KEY IN-LINE AND NEW PRODUCTS

WE RECORDED PRODUCT SALES OF MORE THAN $1 BILLION FOR EACH OF EIGHT PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS IN 2007.

LIPITOR, NORVASC, LYRICA, CELEBREX, VIAGRA,

DETROL/DETROL LA, XALATAN/XALACOM

AND

ZYRTEC/ZYRTEC D

. THOSE PRODUCTS ACCOUNTED FOR 58.0% OF OUR TOTAL PHARMACEUTICAL REVENUES IN 2007.

LIPITOR

SALES IN 2007 WERE APPROXIMATELY $12.7 BILLION, ACCOUNTING FOR 28.4% OF OUR TOTAL 2007 PHARMACEUTICAL REVENUES. THE U.S. BASIC PATENTS FOR

NORVASC

AND

ZYRTEC/ZYRTEC D

EXPIRED IN 2007. IF THE OTHER SIX PRODUCTS OR ANY OF OUR OTHER MAJOR PRODUCTS WERE TO BECOME SUBJECT TO PROBLEMS SUCH AS LOSS OF PATENT PROTECTION, CHANGES IN

PRESCRIPTION GROWTH RATES, MATERIAL PRODUCT LIABILITY LITIGATION, UNEXPECTED SIDE EFFECTS, REGULATORY PROCEEDINGS, PUBLICITY AFFECTING DOCTOR OR PATIENT CONFIDENCE OR PRESSURE FROM EXISTING COMPETITIVE PRODUCTS, OR IF A NEW, MORE EFFECTIVE TREATMENT

SHOULD BE INTRODUCED, THE ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR REVENUES COULD BE SIGNIFICANT. AS NOTED, PATENTS COVERING SEVERAL OF OUR BEST-SELLING

MEDICINES HAVE RECENTLY EXPIRED OR WILL EXPIRE IN THE NEXT FEW YEARS, AND PATENTS COVERING A NUMBER OF OUR BEST-SELLING MEDICINES ARE THE SUBJECT OF PENDING LEGAL CHALLENGES. IN ADDITION, OUR REVENUES COULD BE SIGNIFICANTLY

IMPACTED BY THE TIMING AND RATE OF COMMERCIAL ACCEPTANCE OF KEY NEW PRODUCTS, INCLUDING

LYRICA, SUTENT, CHANTIX/CHAMPIX

AND

SELZENTRY/CELSENTRI.

UNCERTAINTY RELATING TO COX-2 MEDICINES

OUR ABILITY TO FURTHER INCREASE

CELEBREX

SALES MAY BE LIMITED BY THE CONTINUING CONCERN ABOUT THE SAFETY OF

NON-STEROIDAL ANTI-INFLAMMATORY PAIN RELIEVERS.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT INVESTMENT

THE DISCOVERY AND DEVELOPMENT OF NEW PRODUCTS AS WELL AS THE DEVELOPMENT OF ADDITIONAL USES FOR EXISTING PRODUCTS IS VERY IMPORTANT TO THE SUCCESS OF THE COMPANY. HOWEVER, BALANCING CURRENT

GROWTH AND INVESTMENT FOR THE FUTURE REMAINS A MAJOR CHALLENGE. OUR ONGOING INVESTMENTS IN NEW PRODUCT INTRODUCTIONS AND IN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT FOR NEW PRODUCTS AND EXISTING PRODUCT EXTENSIONS COULD EXCEED CORRESPONDING SALES GROWTH. THIS COULD

PRODUCE HIGHER COSTS WITHOUT A PROPORTIONAL INCREASE IN REVENUES.

DEVELOPMENT, REGULATORY APPROVAL AND MARKETING OF PRODUCTS

RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES APPLY PARTICULARLY WITH RESPECT TO PRODUCT-RELATED, FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS. THE OUTCOME OF THE LENGTHY AND COMPLEX PROCESS OF IDENTIFYING NEW COMPOUNDS AND

DEVELOPING NEW PRODUCTS IS INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE AS TO WHETHER OR WHEN WE WILL RECEIVE REGULATORY APPROVAL FOR NEW PRODUCTS OR FOR NEW INDICATIONS OR DOSAGE FORMS FOR EXISTING PRODUCTS. DECISIONS BY REGULATORY AUTHORITIES

REGARDING LABELING AND OTHER MATTERS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE AVAILABILITY OR COMMERCIAL POTENTIAL OF OUR PRODUCTS. THERE ALSO ARE MANY CONSIDERATIONS THAT CAN AFFECT MARKETING OF PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS AROUND THE WORLD. REGULATORY DELAYS, THE

INABILITY TO SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETE CLINICAL TRIALS, CLAIMS AND CONCERNS ABOUT SAFETY AND EFFICACY, NEW DISCOVERIES, PATENT DISPUTES AND CLAIMS ABOUT ADVERSE SIDE EFFECTS ARE

15

A FEW OF THE FACTORS THAT COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE REALIZATION OF RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT AND PRODUCT-RELATED, FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS.

RESEARCH STUDIES

DECISIONS ABOUT RESEARCH STUDIES MADE EARLY IN THE DEVELOPMENT PROCESS OF A DRUG CANDIDATE CAN HAVE A SUBSTANTIAL IMPACT ON THE MARKETING STRATEGY ONCE THE DRUG RECEIVES APPROVAL. MORE DETAILED

STUDIES MAY DEMONSTRATE ADDITIONAL BENEFITS THAT CAN HELP IN THE MARKETING, BUT THEY CONSUME TIME AND RESOURCES AND CAN DELAY SUBMITTING THE DRUG CANDIDATE FOR INITIAL APPROVAL. WE TRY TO PLAN CLINICAL TRIALS PRUDENTLY, BUT THERE IS NO GUARANTEE

THAT A PROPER BALANCE OF SPEED AND TESTING WILL BE MADE IN EACH CASE. THE QUALITY OF OUR DECISIONS IN THIS AREA COULD AFFECT OUR FUTURE RESULTS.

INTEREST RATE AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK

52.2% OF OUR TOTAL 2007 REVENUES WERE DERIVED FROM INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS, INCLUDING 32.9% FROM THE EUROPE/CANADA REGION AND 13.4% FROM THE JAPAN/ASIA REGION. THESE INTERNATIONAL-BASED

REVENUES AS WELL AS OUR SUBSTANTIAL INTERNATIONAL NET ASSETS EXPOSE OUR REVENUES AND EARNINGS TO FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE CHANGES. IN ADDITION, OUR INTEREST-BEARING INVESTMENTS, LOANS AND BORROWINGS ARE SUBJECT TO RISK FROM CHANGES IN INTEREST

RATES. THESE RISKS AND THE MEASURES WE HAVE TAKEN TO HELP CONTAIN THEM ARE DISCUSSED IN THE SECTION ENTITLED FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT IN OUR 2007 FINANCIAL REPORT. FOR ADDITIONAL DETAILS, SEE NOTE 10-D TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS,

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS: DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES,

IN OUR 2007 FINANCIAL REPORT. THOSE SECTIONS OF OUR 2007 FINANCIAL REPORT ARE INCORPORATED BY

REFERENCE.

NOTWITHSTANDING OUR EFFORTS TO FORESEE AND MITIGATE THE EFFECTS OF CHANGES IN FISCAL CIRCUMSTANCES, WE CANNOT PREDICT WITH CERTAINTY CHANGES IN CURRENCY AND INTEREST RATES, INFLATION OR OTHER

RELATED FACTORS AFFECTING OUR BUSINESSES.

RISKS AFFECTING INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS

OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS ALSO COULD BE AFFECTED BY CHANGES IN INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY LEGAL PROTECTIONS AND REMEDIES, TRADE REGULATIONS AND

PROCEDURES AND ACTIONS AFFECTING APPROVAL, PRODUCTION, PRICING, REIMBURSEMENT AND MARKETING OF PRODUCTS, AS WELL AS BY UNSTABLE GOVERNMENTS AND LEGAL SYSTEMS AND INTER-GOVERNMENTAL DISPUTES. ANY OF THESE CHANGES COULD

ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS.

PRODUCT MANUFACTURING AND MARKETING RISKS

DIFFICULTIES OR DELAYS IN PRODUCT MANUFACTURING OR MARKETING, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE INABILITY TO INCREASE PRODUCTION CAPACITY COMMENSURATE WITH DEMAND OR THE FAILURE TO PREDICT

MARKET DEMAND FOR, OR TO GAIN MARKET ACCEPTANCE OF, APPROVED PRODUCTS, COULD AFFECT FUTURE RESULTS.

COST AND EXPENSE CONTROL/UNUSUAL EVENTS

GROWTH IN COSTS AND EXPENSES, CHANGES IN PRODUCT, SEGMENT AND GEOGRAPHIC MIX AND THE IMPACT OF ACQUISITIONS, DIVESTITURES, RESTRUCTURINGS, PRODUCT WITHDRAWALS AND OTHER UNUSUAL EVENTS THAT

COULD RESULT FROM EVOLVING BUSINESS STRATEGIES, EVALUATION OF ASSET REALIZATION AND ORGANIZATIONAL RESTRUCTURING COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT FUTURE RESULTS. SUCH RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES INCLUDE, IN PARTICULAR, OUR ABILITY TO REALIZE THE PROJECTED

BENEFITS OF OUR COST-REDUCTION INITIATIVES.

CHANGES IN LAWS AND ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

OUR FUTURE RESULTS COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY CHANGES IN LAWS AND REGULATIONS, INCLUDING CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING STANDARDS, TAXATION REQUIREMENTS (INCLUDING TAX-RATE CHANGES, NEW TAX LAWS AND

REVISED TAX LAW INTERPRETATIONS), COMPETITION LAWS AND ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS IN THE U.S. AND OTHER COUNTRIES.

TERRORIST ACTIVITY

OUR FUTURE RESULTS COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY CHANGES IN BUSINESS, POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, INCLUDING THE COST AND AVAILABILITY OF INSURANCE, DUE TO THE THREAT OF TERRORIST

ACTIVITY IN THE U.S. AND OTHER PARTS OF THE WORLD AND RELATED U.S. MILITARY ACTION OVERSEAS.

16

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

WE AND CERTAIN OF OUR SUBSIDIARIES ARE INVOLVED IN VARIOUS PATENT, PRODUCT LIABILITY, CONSUMER, COMMERCIAL, SECURITIES, ENVIRONMENTAL AND TAX LITIGATIONS AND CLAIMS, GOVERNMENT INVESTIGATIONS,

AND OTHER LEGAL PROCEEDINGS THAT ARISE FROM TIME TO TIME IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF OUR BUSINESS. LITIGATION IS INHERENTLY UNPREDICTABLE, AND EXCESSIVE VERDICTS DO OCCUR. ALTHOUGH WE BELIEVE WE HAVE SUBSTANTIAL DEFENSES IN THESE MATTERS, WE COULD IN

THE FUTURE INCUR JUDGMENTS OR ENTER INTO SETTLEMENTS OF CLAIMS THAT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN ANY PARTICULAR PERIOD.

PATENT CLAIMS INCLUDE CHALLENGES TO THE COVERAGE AND/OR VALIDITY OF OUR PATENTS ON VARIOUS PRODUCTS OR PROCESSES. ALTHOUGH WE BELIEVE WE HAVE SUBSTANTIAL DEFENSES TO THESE CHALLENGES WITH

RESPECT TO ALL OUR MATERIAL PATENTS, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE AS TO THE OUTCOME OF THESE MATTERS, AND A LOSS IN ANY OF THESE CASES COULD RESULT IN A LOSS OF PATENT PROTECTION FOR THE DRUG AT ISSUE, WHICH COULD LEAD TO A SIGNIFICANT LOSS OF SALES OF

THAT DRUG AND COULD MATERIALLY AFFECT FUTURE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES

WE PLAN TO ENHANCE OUR PRODUCT PIPELINE THROUGH ACQUISITIONS, LICENSING AND ALLIANCES (SEE

REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT AND PIPELINE PRODUCTIVITY

UNDER

OUR OPERATING ENVIRONMENT AND RESPONSE TO KEY OPPORTUNITIES AND CHALLENGES

IN OUR 2007 FINANCIAL REPORT, WHICH SECTION IS INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE). HOWEVER, THESE ENHANCEMENT PLANS ARE SUBJECT TO THE AVAILABILITY AND COST OF APPROPRIATE OPPORTUNITIES AND COMPETITION FROM OTHER PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES

THAT ARE SEEKING SIMILAR OPPORTUNITIES.

INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY

WE RELY TO A LARGE EXTENT UPON SOPHISTICATED INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS AND INFRASTRUCTURE. THE SIZE AND COMPLEXITY OF OUR COMPUTER SYSTEMS MAKE THEM POTENTIALLY VULNERABLE TO BREAKDOWN,

MALICIOUS INTRUSION AND RANDOM ATTACK. LIKEWISE, DATA PRIVACY BREACHES BY EMPLOYEES AND OTHERS WITH PERMITTED ACCESS TO OUR SYSTEMS MAY POSE A RISK THAT SENSITIVE DATA MAY BE EXPOSED TO UNAUTHORIZED PERSONS OR TO THE PUBLIC. WHILE WE HAVE INVESTED

HEAVILY IN PROTECTION OF DATA AND

INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT OUR EFFORTS WILL PREVENT BREAKDOWNS OR BREACHES IN OUR SYSTEMS THAT COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS.

ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS

NOT APPLICABLE.

ITEM 2. PROPERTIES

OUR CORPORATE HEADQUARTERS AND THE HEADQUARTERS OF OUR WORLDWIDE PHARMACEUTICALS AND ANIMAL HEALTH BUSINESSES ARE LOCATED AT OUR WORLD HEADQUARTERS, WHICH INCLUDES SEVERAL OWNED AND LEASED

BUILDINGS IN NEW YORK CITY.

FOR OUR WORLDWIDE PHARMACEUTICALS BUSINESS, WE OWN AND LEASE SPACE AROUND THE WORLD FOR SALES AND MARKETING, ADMINISTRATIVE SUPPORT AND CUSTOMER SERVICE FUNCTIONS.

OUR GLOBAL RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT AND BIOTECHNOLOGY AND BIOINNOVATION CENTER DIVISIONS ARE HEADQUARTERED IN OWNED AND LEASED FACILITIES IN NEW LONDON, CONNECTICUT AND SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO,

CALIFORNIA, RESPECTIVELY. WE OPERATE BOTH DIVISIONS IN 17 LOCATIONS AROUND THE WORLD. MORE EFFICIENT USE OF OUR R&D FACILITIES IS A COMPONENT OF PFIZERS COST-REDUCTION INITIATIVES AND THE EXPANSION OF THOSE INITIATIVES WAS ANNOUNCED ON

JANUARY 22, 2007. SINCE THAT TIME, THE MAJORITY OF R&D ACTIVITIES IN ANN ARBOR, PLYMOUTH TOWNSHIP AND SEVERAL BUILDINGS IN KALAMAZOO, MICHIGAN HAVE BEEN CONCLUDED, AND DISPOSITION EFFORTS ARE UNDERWAY FOR THOSE SITES. R&D OPERATIONS WILL

CONTINUE, AS NOTED BELOW, IN OTHER RETAINED BUILDINGS IN KALAMAZOO. DISPOSITION ALTERNATIVES, SUBJECT TO CONSULTATION WITH WORKS COUNCILS AND LOCAL LABOR LAWS, ARE ALSO BEING PURSUED IN AMBOISE, FRANCE AND NAGOYA, JAPAN.

WE HAVE VETERINARY MEDICINE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT OPERATIONS IN OWNED FACILITIES IN HENRIETTA, KALAMAZOO AND RICHLAND TOWNSHIP, MICHIGAN, AND SANDWICH, ENGLAND. ADDITIONALLY, THESE

OPERATIONS OCCUPY LEASED FACILITIES IN MELBOURNE, AUSTRALIA.

OUR GLOBAL MANUFACTURING (PGM) DIVISION IS HEADQUARTERED IN NEW YORK, NY AND IN PEAPACK, NJ AND OPERATES PLANTS IN 57 LOCATIONS AROUND THE WORLD THAT MANUFACTURE PRODUCTS FOR OUR

17

PHARMACEUTICAL AND ANIMAL HEALTH BUSINESSES. MAJOR FACILITIES ARE LOCATED IN BELGIUM, BRAZIL, CHINA, FRANCE, GERMANY, IRELAND, ITALY, JAPAN, MEXICO, PUERTO RICO, SINGAPORE, SWEDEN, THE UNITED KINGDOM AND THE UNITED STATES.

THE GLOBAL MANUFACTURING DIVISION ALSO OPERATES DISTRIBUTION FACILITIES IN MAJOR MARKETS AROUND THE WORLD. AS PART OF PFIZERS TRANSFORMATION AND PLANT NETWORK STRATEGY PRODUCTIVITY INITIATIVES, 12 OF THE MANUFACTURING FACILITIES ARE SCHEDULED

TO BE SOLD OR CLOSED WITHIN THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS AS GLOBAL MANUFACTURING CONTINUES TO OPTIMIZE ITS PLANT NETWORK. THIS INCLUDES A NUMBER OF PLANTS THAT WERE ANNOUNCED FOR CLOSURE IN EARLY 2007 AS PART OF PFIZERS STREAMLINING INITIATIVES.

STUDIES ARE UNDERWAY TO FURTHER CONSOLIDATE THE DISTRIBUTION NETWORK.

IN GENERAL, OUR PROPERTIES ARE WELL MAINTAINED, ADEQUATE AND SUITABLE FOR THEIR PURPOSES. SEE NOTE 12 TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS,

THE ORGANIZATION. THESE ARE ENHANCEMENTS OF ONGOING ACTIVITIES TO SUPPORT THE GROWTH OF OUR FINANCIAL SHARED SERVICE CAPABILITIES AND STANDARDIZE OUR FINANCIAL SYSTEMS. NONE OF THESE INITIATIVES IS IN RESPONSE TO ANY IDENTIFIED DEFICIENCY OR

WEAKNESS IN OUR INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING.
