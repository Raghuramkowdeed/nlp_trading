DISCOVERY OR DEVELOPMENT PROCESSES OR PROJECTS AS WELL AS OUR PRODUCT LINES THROUGH LICENSING OR OTHER ARRANGEMENTS.

DRUG

DISCOVERY AND DEVELOPMENT IS TIME CONSUMING, EXPENSIVE AND UNPREDICTABLE. ON

AVERAGE, ONLY ONE OUT OF MANY THOUSANDS OF CHEMICAL COMPOUNDS DISCOVERED BY

RESEARCHERS PROVES TO BE BOTH MEDICALLY EFFECTIVE AND SAFE ENOUGH TO BECOME AN

APPROVED MEDICINE. THE PROCESS FROM DISCOVERY TO DEVELOPMENT TO REGULATORY APPROVAL CAN TAKE

MORE THAN TEN YEARS. DRUG CANDIDATES CAN FAIL AT ANY STAGE OF THE PROCESS.

CANDIDATES MAY NOT RECEIVE REGULATORY APPROVAL EVEN AFTER MANY YEARS OF

RESEARCH.

WE BELIEVE THAT OUR INVESTMENTS IN RESEARCH HAVE BEEN REWARDED BY THE

NUMBER OF PHARMACEUTICAL COMPOUNDS AND NEW THERAPIES WE HAVE IN ALL STAGES OF

DEVELOPMENT; WE CURRENTLY ARE WORKING ON MORE THAN 160 PROJECTS IN DEVELOPMENT

AND SEVERAL HUNDRED PROJECTS IN DISCOVERY RESEARCH. IN RECENT YEARS, OUR DISCOVERY

SCIENTISTS HAVE DELIVERED DOZENS OF NEW CHEMICAL COMPOUNDS TO EARLY

DEVELOPMENT. WHILE THESE NEW CANDIDATES MAY OR MAY NOT EVENTUALLY RECEIVE

REGULATORY APPROVAL, NEW DRUG CANDIDATES ENTERING DEVELOPMENT ARE THE FOUNDATION FOR FUTURE

PRODUCTS.

IN ADDITION TO DISCOVERING AND DEVELOPING NEW PRODUCTS, OUR RESEARCH

OPERATIONS ADD VALUE TO OUR EXISTING PRODUCTS BY IMPROVING THEIR EFFECTIVENESS

AND BY DISCOVERING NEW USES FOR THEM. IN FEBRUARY 2003, FOR EXAMPLE, THE FDA

APPROVED THE ADDITIONAL USE OF

ZOLOFT

FOR THE TREATMENT OF SOCIAL ANXIETY

DISORDER.

INFORMATION CONCERNING SEVERAL OF OUR DRUG CANDIDATES IN DEVELOPMENT AS

WELL AS SUPPLEMENTAL FILINGS FOR EXISTING PRODUCTS IS SET FORTH UNDER THE

HEADING

PRODUCT DEVELOPMENTS

ON PAGES 33 AND 34 OF OUR 2002 ANNUAL REPORT. THAT

INFORMATION IS INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE. IN FEBRUARY 2003, WE

SUBMITTED AN APPLICATION TO THE EUROPEAN MEDICINES EVALUATION AGENCY

FOR APPROVAL OF OUR DEVELOPMENTAL COMPOUND

PREGABALIN

FOR THE

TREATMENT OF NEUROPATHIC PAIN AND FOR USE WITH OTHER MEDICATIONS IN

THE TREATMENT OF EPILEPSY. WE EXPECT TO SUBMIT AN APPLICATION TO THE

FDA FOR THE USE OF

PREGABALIN

FOR THOSE CONDITIONS, AS WELL AS

FOR GENERALIZED ANXIETY DISORDER, LATER THIS YEAR.

OUR COMPETITORS ALSO DEVOTE SUBSTANTIAL FUNDS AND RESOURCES TO RESEARCH

AND DEVELOPMENT. IN ADDITION, THE CONSOLIDATION THAT HAS OCCURRED IN OUR

5

TABLE OF CONTENTS

INDUSTRY HAS CREATED COMPANIES WITH SUBSTANTIAL RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

RESOURCES. THE EXTENT TO WHICH OUR COMPETITORS ARE SUCCESSFUL IN THEIR RESEARCH

COULD RESULT IN EROSION OF THE SALES OF OUR PRODUCTS AND UNANTICIPATED PRODUCT

OBSOLESCENCE.

INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS

WE HAVE SIGNIFICANT OPERATIONS OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES. THEY ARE

CONDUCTED BOTH THROUGH OUR SUBSIDIARIES AND THROUGH DISTRIBUTORS, AND INVOLVE

THE SAME BUSINESS SEGMENTS  PHARMACEUTICAL AND CONSUMER PRODUCTS  AS OUR U.S.

OPERATIONS.

REVENUES FROM OPERATIONS OUTSIDE THE U.S. OF $11.6 BILLION ACCOUNTED FOR

35.9% OF OUR TOTAL REVENUES IN 2002. REVENUES EXCEEDED $500 MILLION IN EACH OF

SEVEN COUNTRIES OUTSIDE THE U.S. IN 2002. NO SINGLE COUNTRY OUTSIDE THE U.S.

CONTRIBUTED MORE THAN 10% OF OUR TOTAL REVENUES. JAPAN IS OUR SECOND-LARGEST

NATIONAL MARKET, WITH 6.1% OF OUR REVENUES IN 2002, 6.2% IN 2001 AND 6.6% IN

2000.

OUR INTERNATIONAL BUSINESSES ARE SUBJECT, IN VARYING DEGREES, TO A NUMBER

OF RISKS INHERENT IN CARRYING ON BUSINESS IN OTHER COUNTRIES. THESE INCLUDE

     CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS

     CAPITAL AND EXCHANGE CONTROL REGULATIONS

     EXPROPRIATION AND NATIONALIZATION

     OTHER RESTRICTIVE GOVERNMENT ACTIONS

OUR INTERNATIONAL BUSINESSES ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO GOVERNMENT-IMPOSED

CONSTRAINTS, INCLUDING LAWS ON PRICING OR REIMBURSEMENT FOR USE OF PRODUCTS.

SEE

GOVERNMENT REGULATION AND PRICE CONSTRAINTS

BELOW FOR DISCUSSION OF THESE

MATTERS.

DEPENDING ON THE DIRECTION OF CHANGE RELATIVE TO THE U.S. DOLLAR, FOREIGN

CURRENCY VALUES CAN INCREASE OR REDUCE THE REPORTED DOLLAR VALUE OF OUR NET

ASSETS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. IN 2002, FOREIGN EXCHANGE HAD A NOMINAL

IMPACT ON REVENUES. WHILE WE CANNOT PREDICT WITH CERTAINTY FUTURE CHANGES IN

FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES OR THE EFFECT THEY WILL HAVE ON US, WE ATTEMPT TO

MITIGATE THEIR IMPACT THROUGH OPERATIONAL MEANS AND BY USING VARIOUS FINANCIAL

INSTRUMENTS. SEE THE DISCUSSION UNDER NOTE 6-D TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS,

DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES

, ON PAGES

MARKETING

IN OUR GLOBAL PHARMACEUTICAL BUSINESS, WE PROMOTE OUR PRODUCTS TO HEALTH

CARE PROVIDERS SUCH AS DOCTORS, NURSE PRACTITIONERS, PHYSICIAN ASSISTANTS,

PHARMACISTS, HOSPITALS, PHARMACY BENEFIT MANAGERS (PBMS), MANAGED CARE

ORGANIZATIONS (MCOS) AND GOVERNMENT AGENCIES. WE ALSO MARKET DIRECTLY TO

CONSUMERS IN THE UNITED STATES THROUGH DIRECT-TO-CONSUMER PRINT AND TELEVISION

ADVERTISING. IN ADDITION, WE SPONSOR GENERAL ADVERTISING TO EDUCATE THE PUBLIC

ABOUT OUR INNOVATIVE MEDICAL RESEARCH.

OUR OPERATIONS INCLUDE SEVERAL PHARMACEUTICAL SALES ORGANIZATIONS. EACH

SALES ORGANIZATION MARKETS A DISTINCT GROUP OF PRODUCTS. OUR PRESCRIPTION

PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS ARE SOLD PRINCIPALLY TO WHOLESALERS, BUT WE ALSO SELL

DIRECTLY TO RETAILERS, HOSPITALS, CLINICS, GOVERNMENT AGENCIES AND PHARMACIES.

THROUGH OUR MARKETING ORGANIZATIONS, WE EXPLAIN THE APPROVED USES AND

ADVANTAGES OF OUR PRODUCTS TO MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS. WE WORK TO GAIN ACCESS TO

HEALTH AUTHORITY, PBM AND MCO FORMULARIES (LISTS OF RECOMMENDED OR APPROVED

MEDICINES AND OTHER PRODUCTS) AND REIMBURSEMENT LISTS BY DEMONSTRATING THE

QUALITIES AND TREATMENT BENEFITS OF OUR PRODUCTS. WE ALSO WORK WITH MCOS AND

PBMS TO ASSIST THEM WITH DISEASE MANAGEMENT, PATIENT EDUCATION AND OTHER TOOLS

THAT HELP THEIR MEDICAL TREATMENT ROUTINES. FOR EXAMPLE, WE SPONSOR A PROGRAM

OFFERED BY THE STATE OF FLORIDA AGENCY FOR HEALTH CARE ADMINISTRATION THAT IS

DESIGNED TO HELP MANAGE CHRONIC DISEASES AMONG FLORIDAS MEDICAID POPULATION.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

MARKETING OF PRESCRIPTION PHARMACEUTICALS DEPENDS TO A DEGREE ON COMPLEX

DECISIONS ABOUT THE SCOPE OF CLINICAL TRIALS MADE YEARS BEFORE PRODUCT

APPROVAL. ALL DRUGS MUST COMPLETE CLINICAL TRIALS REQUIRED BY REGULATORY

AUTHORITIES TO SHOW THEY ARE SAFE AND EFFECTIVE FOR TREATING ONE OR MORE

MEDICAL PROBLEMS. A MANUFACTURER MAY CHOOSE, HOWEVER, TO UNDERTAKE ADDITIONAL

STUDIES, INCLUDING COMPARATIVE CLINICAL TRIALS WITH COMPETITIVE PRODUCTS, TO

DEMONSTRATE ADDITIONAL ADVANTAGES OF A COMPOUND. THOSE STUDIES CAN BE COSTLY

AND TAKE YEARS TO COMPLETE, AND THE RESULTS ARE UNCERTAIN. BALANCING THESE

CONSIDERATIONS MAKES IT DIFFICULT TO DECIDE WHETHER AND WHEN TO UNDERTAKE SUCH

ADDITIONAL STUDIES. BUT, WHEN THEY ARE SUCCESSFUL, SUCH STUDIES CAN HAVE A

MAJOR IMPACT ON APPROVED MARKETING CLAIMS AND STRATEGIES.

SEPARATE SALES ORGANIZATIONS ARE USED BY OUR ANIMAL HEALTH BUSINESS TO

PROMOTE ITS PRODUCTS. ITS ADVERTISING AND PROMOTION ARE GENERALLY TARGETED TO

HEALTH PROFESSIONALS, DIRECTLY AND THROUGH MEDICAL JOURNALS. ANIMAL HEALTH AND

NUTRITION PRODUCTS ARE SOLD THROUGH VETERINARIANS, DRUG WHOLESALERS,

DISTRIBUTORS AND RETAIL OUTLETS AS WELL AS DIRECTLY TO USERS. WHERE

APPROPRIATE, THESE PRODUCTS ARE ALSO MARKETED THROUGH PRINT AND TELEVISION

ADVERTISING.

OUR CHC BUSINESS PRIMARILY USES ITS OWN REPRESENTATIVES TO DIRECTLY

PROMOTE ITS PRODUCTS. WE ALSO USE PRINT AND TELEVISION CONSUMER ADVERTISING AND

OFFER SALES INCENTIVES SUCH AS COUPONS TO PROMOTE OUR CONSUMER PRODUCTS. THESE

PRODUCTS ARE SOLD THROUGH VARIOUS RETAILERS. CHC ALSO MARKETS AND ADVERTISES

CERTAIN PRODUCTS DIRECTLY TO PROFESSIONALS USING A PROFESSIONAL DETAIL FORCE.

DURING 2002, SALES TO OUR THREE LARGEST PHARMACEUTICAL AND CONSUMER

HEALTHCARE PRODUCTS WHOLESALERS WERE AS FOLLOWS.



MCKESSON, INC.  16.8% OF OUR REVENUES;



AMERISOURCEBERGEN CORPORATION  14.8% OF OUR REVENUES; AND



CARDINAL HEALTH, INC.  13.4% OF OUR REVENUES.

SALES TO THESE WHOLESALERS WERE CONCENTRATED IN THE PHARMACEUTICAL

SEGMENT. APART FROM THESE INSTANCES, NEITHER OF OUR BUSINESS SEGMENTS IS DEPENDENT

ON ANY ONE CUSTOMER OR GROUP OF RELATED CUSTOMERS.

PATENTS AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS

OUR PRODUCTS ARE SOLD AROUND THE WORLD UNDER BRAND-NAME, LOGO AND CERTAIN

PRODUCT DESIGN TRADEMARKS THAT WE CONSIDER IN THE AGGREGATE TO BE OF MATERIAL

IMPORTANCE. TRADEMARK PROTECTION CONTINUES IN SOME COUNTRIES FOR AS LONG AS THE

MARK IS USED AND, IN OTHER COUNTRIES, FOR AS LONG AS IT IS REGISTERED.

REGISTRATIONS GENERALLY ARE FOR FIXED, BUT RENEWABLE, TERMS.

WE OWN OR LICENSE A NUMBER OF U.S. AND FOREIGN PATENTS. THESE PATENTS

COVER



PHARMACEUTICAL AND OTHER PRODUCTS AND THEIR USES



PHARMACEUTICAL FORMULATIONS



PRODUCT MANUFACTURING PROCESSES



INTERMEDIATE CHEMICAL COMPOUNDS USED IN MANUFACTURING

PATENTS FOR INDIVIDUAL PRODUCTS EXTEND FOR VARYING PERIODS ACCORDING TO

THE DATE OF PATENT FILING OR GRANT AND THE LEGAL TERM OF PATENTS IN THE VARIOUS

COUNTRIES WHERE PATENT PROTECTION IS OBTAINED. THE ACTUAL PROTECTION AFFORDED

BY A PATENT, WHICH CAN VARY FROM COUNTRY TO COUNTRY, DEPENDS UPON THE TYPE OF

PATENT, THE SCOPE OF ITS COVERAGE AND THE AVAILABILITY OF LEGAL REMEDIES IN THE

COUNTRY.

IN THE AGGREGATE, OUR PATENT AND RELATED RIGHTS ARE OF MATERIAL IMPORTANCE

TO OUR BUSINESSES IN THE UNITED STATES AND MOST OTHER COUNTRIES. BASED ON

CURRENT PRODUCT SALES, AND CONSIDERING THE VIGOROUS COMPETITION WITH PRODUCTS

SOLD BY OTHERS, THE PATENT RIGHTS WE CONSIDER SIGNIFICANT IN RELATION TO OUR

BUSINESS AS A WHOLE, TOGETHER WITH THE YEAR IN WHICH THE BASIC U.S. PATENT

EXPIRES (INCLUDING, WHERE APPLICABLE, THE ADDITIONAL SIX-MONTH PEDIATRIC

EXCLUSIVITY PERIOD), ARE THOSE FOR THE FOLLOWING DRUGS.

IN SOME INSTANCES, THERE ARE LATER-EXPIRING PATENTS RELATING TO THESE

PRODUCTS DIRECTED TO PARTICULAR FORMS OR COMPOSITIONS OF THE DRUG OR TO METHODS

OF MANUFACTURING OR USING THE DRUG IN THE TREATMENT OF FURTHER DISEASES OR

CONDITIONS. SUCH PATENTS MAY NOT PROTECT THE COMPANYS DRUG FROM GENERIC DRUG

COMPETITION AFTER THE EXPIRATION OF THE BASIC PATENT.

ZITHROMAX

IS PATENTED BY PLIVA, A CROATIAN PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANY. THE

DRUG IS LICENSED EXCLUSIVELY TO US BY PLIVA FOR SALES AND MARKETING IN MAJOR

COUNTRIES, AND WE PURCHASE THE COMPOUND IN BULK CRUDE FORM FROM PLIVA.

CELEBREX

IS PATENTED BY PHARMACIA CORPORATION, WITH WHOM WE COPROMOTE

CELEBREX

IN ALL WORLD MARKETS EXCEPT JAPAN. AN ACTION AGAINST PHARMACIA AND THE

COMPANY ALLEGING PATENT INFRINGEMENT WITH RESPECT TO THE SALE OF

CELEBREX

(AS

WELL AS

BEXTRA

) WAS DISMISSED ON MARCH 5, 2003. THE PLAINTIFF IN THAT ACTION

HAS APPEALED THE DECISION.

ZYRTEC

IS PATENTED BY THE BELGIAN COMPANY UCB S.A. AND IS LICENSED TO US

FOR SALES IN THE U.S., CANADA, EUROPE, AUSTRALIA AND SOUTH AFRICA. WE COPROMOTE

ZYRTEC

AS A PRESCRIPTION MEDICINE IN THE U.S. WITH A SUBSIDIARY OF UCB S.A. AND

HAVE A LICENSE TO SELL

ZYRTEC

AS AN OTC MEDICINE IN THE OTHER MARKETS.

ARICEPT

IS PATENTED BY EISAI CO., LTD. WE COPROMOTE

ARICEPT

WITH EISAI IN

THE U.S. AND SEVERAL OTHER COUNTRIES AND HAVE AN EXCLUSIVE LICENSE TO SELL THE

DRUG IN VARIOUS OTHER COUNTRIES.

THE BASIC U.S. PATENTS RELATING TO

NEURONTIN

EXPIRED IN 1994 AND 2000.

HOWEVER, IN APRIL 2000, A U.S. PATENT WAS GRANTED RELATING TO STABLE

PHARMACEUTICAL COMPOSITIONS OF

NEURONTIN

CONTAINING LOW LEVELS OF LACTAM

IMPURITY. THIS PATENT EXPIRES IN 2017. OTHER COMPANIES HAVE FILED APPLICATIONS

WITH THE FDA SEEKING APPROVAL OF PRODUCTS THAT WE BELIEVE INFRINGE THIS PATENT.

IN ADDITION, OTHER COMPANIES HAVE FILED APPLICATIONS WITH THE FDA SEEKING

APPROVAL OF PRODUCTS THAT WE BELIEVE INFRINGE OUR PATENTS COVERING, AMONG OTHER

PRODUCTS,

LIPITOR, NORVASC, ZOLOFT

,

DIFLUCAN, ACCUPRIL

AND

PROCARDIA XL

. IN THE

CASE OF

ZOLOFT

, WHILE GENERIC MANUFACTURERS ARE CHALLENGING CERTAIN OF OUR

PATENTS, THE OUTCOME OF THESE CHALLENGES WILL NOT AFFECT THE TIMING OF GENERIC

COMPETITION WITH THIS PRODUCT DUE TO THE EXISTENCE OF ADDITIONAL PATENTS.

WE HAVE OTHER PATENT RIGHTS COVERING ADDITIONAL PRODUCTS THAT HAVE LESSER

REVENUES.

THE EXPIRATION OF A PRODUCT PATENT OR LOSS OF PATENT PROTECTION RESULTING

FROM A LEGAL CHALLENGE NORMALLY RESULTS IN SIGNIFICANT COMPETITION FROM GENERIC

PRODUCTS AGAINST THE COVERED PRODUCT AND, PARTICULARLY IN THE U.S., CAN RESULT

IN A SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN SALES OF THE PIONEER PRODUCT. IN SOME CASES,

HOWEVER, WE CAN CONTINUE TO OBTAIN COMMERCIAL BENEFITS FROM

     PRODUCT MANUFACTURING TRADE SECRETS

     PATENTS ON USES FOR PRODUCTS

     PATENTS ON PROCESSES AND INTERMEDIATES FOR THE ECONOMICAL MANUFACTURE OF THE

ACTIVE INGREDIENTS

     PATENTS FOR SPECIAL FORMULATIONS OF THE PRODUCT OR DELIVERY MECHANISMS

     CONVERSION OF THE ACTIVE INGREDIENT TO OTC PRODUCTS

THE EFFECT OF PRODUCT PATENT EXPIRATION OR LOSS ALSO DEPENDS UPON

     THE NATURE OF THE MARKET AND THE POSITION OF THE PRODUCT IN IT

     THE GROWTH OF THE MARKET

     THE COMPLEXITIES AND ECONOMICS OF MANUFACTURE OF THE PRODUCT

     THE REQUIREMENTS OF GENERIC DRUG LAWS

ONE OF THE MAIN LIMITATIONS ON OUR OPERATIONS IN SOME COUNTRIES OUTSIDE

THE U.S. IS THE LACK OF EFFECTIVE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY PROTECTION OF OUR

PRODUCTS. UNDER INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS IN RECENT YEARS, GLOBAL PROTECTION OF

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS IS IMPROVING. THE GENERAL AGREEMENT ON TARIFFS AND

TRADE REQUIRES PARTICIPANT COUNTRIES TO AMEND THEIR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY LAWS

TO PROVIDE PATENT PROTECTION FOR PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS BY THE END OF A

TEN-YEAR TRANSITION PERIOD. A NUMBER

8

TABLE OF CONTENTS

OF COUNTRIES ARE DOING THIS. WE HAVE EXPERIENCED SIGNIFICANT GROWTH IN OUR

BUSINESSES IN SOME OF THOSE NATIONS, AND OUR CONTINUED BUSINESS EXPANSION IN

THOSE COUNTRIES DEPENDS TO A LARGE DEGREE ON FURTHER PATENT PROTECTION

IMPROVEMENT.

SEE ITEM 3,

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

, BELOW.

COMPETITION

COMPETITION IS INTENSE IN ALL OF OUR BUSINESSES AND INCLUDES MANY LARGE

AND SMALL COMPETITORS.

THE PRINCIPAL MEANS OF COMPETITION VARY AMONG PRODUCT CATEGORIES AND

BUSINESS GROUPS. TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATIONS AFFECTING



EFFICACY



SAFETY



PATIENTS EASE OF USE



COST EFFECTIVENESS

ARE IMPORTANT TO SUCCESS IN ALL OF OUR BUSINESSES.

OUR BUSINESSES ALSO FOCUS ON UNMET MEDICAL NEEDS AND THERAPEUTIC

IMPROVEMENTS. OUR EMPHASIS ON INNOVATION HAS LED TO OUR MULTI-BILLION-DOLLAR

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT INVESTMENTS OVER THE PAST DECADE.

OUR HUMAN PHARMACEUTICAL BUSINESS COMPETES WITH OTHER WORLDWIDE

RESEARCH-BASED DRUG COMPANIES, MANY SMALLER RESEARCH COMPANIES WITH MORE

LIMITED THERAPEUTIC FOCUS AND GENERIC DRUG MANUFACTURERS. OUR PHARMACEUTICAL

OPERATIONS ARE THE LARGEST IN THE WORLD.

IN RECENT YEARS, A COMPARISON OF THE TOTAL COST OF MEDICAL TREATMENTS

USING PHARMACEUTICALS VERSUS ALTERNATIVE TREATMENTS FOR THE SAME CONDITION HAS

BECOME AN IMPORTANT BASIS OF COMPETITION. MCOS AND PBMS LOOK TO COST ADVANTAGES

AS WELL AS MEDICAL BENEFITS IN MAKING THEIR DRUG FORMULARY DECISIONS.

OUR PHARMACEUTICAL SALES AND MARKETING ORGANIZATION IS A VALUABLE

COMPETITIVE ASSET. OUR SALESPEOPLES ABILITY TO REACH MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS

WITH INFORMATION ABOUT OUR PRODUCTS HELPS US RESPOND TO COMPETITIVE EFFORTS AND

LAUNCH NEW PRODUCTS.

WE HAVE A SIGNIFICANT PRESENCE IN THE ANIMAL HEALTH MARKETPLACE, BUT MANY

OTHER COMPANIES OFFER COMPETITIVE PRODUCTS. ALTOGETHER, THERE ARE HUNDREDS OF

PRODUCERS OF ANIMAL HEALTH PRODUCTS THROUGHOUT THE WORLD. THE PRINCIPAL METHODS

OF COMPETITION VARY SOMEWHAT DEPENDING ON THE PARTICULAR PRODUCT. THEY INCLUDE



PRODUCT INNOVATION



SERVICE



PRICE



QUALITY



EFFECTIVE PROMOTION TO VETERINARY PROFESSIONALS AND CONSUMERS

WE PROMOTE OUR PRODUCTS DIRECTLY THROUGH OUR SALES REPRESENTATIVES AS WELL AS

THROUGH ADVERTISING.

MANY OTHER COMPANIES, LARGE AND SMALL, MANUFACTURE AND SELL ONE OR MORE

PRODUCTS THAT ARE SIMILAR TO OUR CONSUMER HEALTHCARE PRODUCTS. SOURCES OF

COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE INCLUDE



PRODUCT QUALITY AND EFFICACY



BRAND IDENTITY



ADVERTISING AND PROMOTION



PRODUCT INNOVATION



BROAD DISTRIBUTION CAPABILITIES



CUSTOMER SATISFACTION



PRICE

SIGNIFICANT EXPENDITURES FOR ADVERTISING, PROMOTION AND MARKETING ARE GENERALLY

REQUIRED TO ACHIEVE BOTH CONSUMER AND TRADE ACCEPTANCE OF CONSUMER PRODUCTS.

IN THE CURRENT ENVIRONMENT OF COMPETITIVE PRESSURES ON PROFIT MARGINS, WE

CONTINUE EFFORTS TO CONTROL THE GROWTH OF OUR EXPENSES. WE HAVE KEPT OUR COSTS

DOWN IN AREAS SUCH AS MANUFACTURING, DISTRIBUTION AND SALES ADMINISTRATION BY

RESTRUCTURING AND CONSOLIDATING FACILITIES. THESE MEASURES HAVE BROUGHT US NEW

EFFICIENCIES AND REDUCED OR CONTAINED OUR OPERATING EXPENSES.

MANAGED CARE ORGANIZATIONS

THE GROWTH OF MCOS IN THE U.S. HAS BEEN A MAJOR FACTOR IN THE COMPETITIVE

MAKE-UP OF THE HEALTH CARE MARKETPLACE. OVER HALF THE U.S. POPULATION NOW

PARTICIPATES IN SOME VERSION OF MANAGED CARE. BECAUSE OF THE SIZE OF THE

PATIENT POPULATION COVERED BY MCOS, MARKETING OF PRESCRIPTION DRUGS TO THEM AND

THE PBMS THAT SERVE MANY OF THOSE ORGANIZATIONS HAS BECOME IMPORTANT TO OUR

BUSINESS.

MCOS CAN INCLUDE MEDICAL INSURANCE COMPANIES, MEDICAL PLAN ADMINISTRATORS,

HEALTH-

9

TABLE OF CONTENTS

MAINTENANCE ORGANIZATIONS, ALLIANCES OF HOSPITALS AND PHYSICIANS AND OTHER

PHYSICIAN ORGANIZATIONS. THE PURCHASING POWER OF MCOS HAS BEEN INCREASING IN

RECENT YEARS DUE TO THEIR GROWING NUMBERS OF ENROLLED PATIENTS. AT THE SAME

TIME, THOSE ORGANIZATIONS HAVE BEEN CONSOLIDATING INTO FEWER, EVEN LARGER

ENTITIES. THIS ENHANCES THEIR PURCHASING STRENGTH AND IMPORTANCE TO US.

A MAJOR OBJECTIVE OF MCOS IS TO CONTAIN AND, WHERE POSSIBLE, REDUCE HEALTH

CARE EXPENDITURES. THEY TYPICALLY USE FORMULARIES, VOLUME PURCHASES AND

LONG-TERM CONTRACTS TO NEGOTIATE DISCOUNTS FROM PHARMACEUTICAL PROVIDERS. THEY

USE THEIR PURCHASING POWER TO BARGAIN FOR LOWER SUPPLIER PRICES. THEY ALSO

EMPHASIZE PRIMARY AND PREVENTIVE CARE, OUT-PATIENT TREATMENT AND PROCEDURES

PERFORMED AT DOCTORS OFFICES AND CLINICS. HOSPITALIZATION AND SURGERY,

TYPICALLY THE MOST EXPENSIVE FORMS OF TREATMENT, ARE CAREFULLY MANAGED.

AS DISCUSSED ABOVE IN

MARKETING

, MCOS AND PBMS TYPICALLY DEVELOP

FORMULARIES TO REDUCE THEIR COST FOR MEDICATIONS. FORMULARIES CAN BE BASED ON

THE PRICES AND THERAPEUTIC BENEFITS OF THE AVAILABLE PRODUCTS. DUE TO THEIR

GENERALLY LOWER COST, GENERIC MEDICINES ARE OFTEN FAVORED. THE BREADTH OF THE

PRODUCTS COVERED BY FORMULARIES CAN VARY CONSIDERABLY FROM ONE MCO TO ANOTHER,

AND MANY FORMULARIES INCLUDE ALTERNATIVE AND COMPETITIVE PRODUCTS FOR TREATMENT

OF PARTICULAR MEDICAL PROBLEMS. MCOS USE A VARIETY OF MEANS TO ENCOURAGE

PATIENTS USE OF PRODUCTS LISTED ON THEIR FORMULARIES.

EXCLUSION OF A PRODUCT FROM A FORMULARY CAN LEAD TO ITS SHARPLY REDUCED

USAGE IN THE MCO PATIENT POPULATION. CONSEQUENTLY, PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES

COMPETE AGGRESSIVELY TO HAVE THEIR PRODUCTS INCLUDED. WHERE POSSIBLE, COMPANIES

COMPETE FOR INCLUSION BASED UPON UNIQUE FEATURES OF THEIR PRODUCTS, SUCH AS

GREATER EFFICACY, BETTER PATIENT EASE OF USE OR FEWER SIDE EFFECTS. A LOWER

OVERALL COST OF THERAPY IS ALSO AN IMPORTANT FACTOR. PRODUCTS THAT DEMONSTRATE

FEWER THERAPEUTIC ADVANTAGES MUST COMPETE FOR INCLUSION BASED PRIMARILY ON

PRICE.

THE GROWTH OF MCOS ALSO APPEARS TO HAVE LED TO GREATER USAGE OF SOME

DRUGS. THE USE OF CERTAIN DRUGS CAN PREVENT THE NEED FOR MORE COSTLY TREATMENTS

SUCH AS HOSPITALIZATION, PROFESSIONAL THERAPY OR EVEN SURGERY. BECAUSE OF THESE

ADVANTAGES, SUCH DRUGS CAN BECOME FAVORED FIRST-LINE TREATMENTS. IN ADDITION,

THE CURRENT TREND OF SOME PATIENTS TO OPT FOR MANAGED CARE ALTERNATIVES TO

MEDICARE MAY INCREASE OVERALL PHARMACEUTICAL USAGE AMONG THAT SEGMENT OF THE

ELDERLY POPULATION. MEDICARE GENERALLY DOES NOT PAY FOR OUTPATIENT USE OF

MEDICINES, SO PATIENTS WHO DO NOT HAVE ANOTHER SOURCE OF PRESCRIPTION DRUG

COVERAGE MUST BEAR THAT COST. MCOS, HOWEVER, OFTEN OFFER DRUG BENEFITS FOR

THEIR PARTICIPANTS.

THESE DEVELOPMENTS NOT ONLY HAVE CREATED PRESSURE ON PRICES, BUT ALSO HAVE

INCREASED SALES OF PRODUCTS ON FORMULARIES. WE HAVE BEEN GENERALLY, ALTHOUGH

NOT UNIVERSALLY, SUCCESSFUL IN HAVING OUR MAJOR PRODUCTS INCLUDED ON MCO

FORMULARIES.

ANOTHER WAY WE ADDRESS THE INTERESTS OF MCOS IS BY DEVELOPING

DISEASE-MANAGEMENT PROGRAMS. THESE PROGRAMS CAN BE ATTRACTIVE TO MCOS BY

IMPROVING PATIENT COMMUNICATIONS AND COMPLIANCE WITH DOSAGE DIRECTIONS, WHICH

ARE IMPORTANT FOR EFFECTIVE DISEASE TREATMENT. THEY CAN HELP MCOS ADDRESS

VARIOUS ASPECTS OF DISEASE MANAGEMENT, SUCH AS PREVENTION, DIAGNOSIS AND

TREATMENT OF CERTAIN DISEASES, INCLUDING USE OF PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS. THIS

COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH CAN IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF CARE AND LOWER COSTLY

COMPLICATIONS OF CHRONIC DISEASES. AS NOTED ABOVE IN

MARKETING

, ONE SUCH

PROGRAM, WHICH IS SPONSORED BY US AND OFFERED BY THE STATE OF FLORIDA AGENCY

FOR HEALTH CARE ADMINISTRATION, IS DESIGNED TO HELP MANAGE CHRONIC DISEASES

AMONG FLORIDAS MEDICAID POPULATION.

GENERIC PRODUCTS

ONE OF THE BIGGEST COMPETITIVE CHALLENGES THAT WE FACE IN THE U.S. AND

THAT IS GROWING INTERNATIONALLY IS FROM GENERIC PHARMACEUTICAL MANUFACTURERS.

UPON THE EXPIRATION OR LOSS OF U.S. PATENT PROTECTION ON A PRODUCT, WE CAN LOSE

THE MAJOR PORTION OF U.S. SALES OF THAT PRODUCT IN A VERY SHORT PERIOD. GENERIC

COMPETITORS OPERATE WITHOUT OUR LARGE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES AND OUR

COSTS OF CONVEYING MEDICAL INFORMATION ABOUT THE PRODUCT TO THE MEDICAL

COMMUNITY. IN ADDITION, THE FDA APPROVAL PROCESS EXEMPTS GENERICS FROM COSTLY

AND TIME-CONSUMING CLINICAL TRIALS TO DEMONSTRATE THEIR SAFETY AND EFFICACY,

AND ALLOWS GENERIC MANUFACTURERS TO RELY ON THE SAFETY AND EFFICACY OF THE

PIONEER PRODUCT. GENERIC PRODUCTS NEED ONLY DEMONSTRATE A LEVEL OF

10

TABLE OF CONTENTS

AVAILABILITY IN THE BLOODSTREAM EQUIVALENT TO THAT OF THE PIONEER PRODUCT.

THIS MEANS THAT AFTER WE HAVE BORNE THE EXPENSES OF DISCOVERING, DEVELOPING AND

TESTING A MEDICINE FOR SAFETY AND EFFICACY, OBTAINING REGULATORY APPROVAL AND

INFORMING THE MEDICAL COMMUNITY ABOUT ITS THERAPEUTIC BENEFITS, GENERIC

COMPETITORS CAN MARKET A COMPETING VERSION OF OUR PRODUCT AFTER THE EXPIRATION

OF OUR PATENT, CHARGE MUCH LESS AND STILL BE PROFITABLE.

AS NOTED ABOVE, MCOS THAT FOCUS PRIMARILY ON THE IMMEDIATE COST OF DRUGS

OFTEN FAVOR GENERICS OVER BRAND-NAME DRUGS. MANY GOVERNMENTS ALSO ENCOURAGE THE

USE OF GENERICS AS ALTERNATIVES TO BRAND-NAME DRUGS IN THEIR HEALTH CARE

PROGRAMS, INCLUDING MEDICAID IN THE U.S. LAWS IN THE U.S. GENERALLY ALLOW, AND

IN SOME CASES REQUIRE, PHARMACISTS TO SUBSTITUTE GENERIC DRUGS THAT HAVE BEEN

RATED UNDER GOVERNMENT PROCEDURES TO BE THERAPEUTICALLY EQUIVALENT TO A

BRAND-NAME DRUG. THE SUBSTITUTION MUST BE MADE UNLESS THE PRESCRIBING PHYSICIAN

EXPRESSLY FORBIDS IT.

RAW MATERIALS

RAW MATERIALS ESSENTIAL TO OUR BUSINESSES ARE PURCHASED WORLDWIDE IN THE

ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS FROM NUMEROUS SUPPLIERS. IN GENERAL, THESE

MATERIALS ARE AVAILABLE FROM MULTIPLE SOURCES. NO SERIOUS SHORTAGES OR DELAYS

WERE ENCOUNTERED IN 2002, AND NONE ARE EXPECTED IN 2003.

GOVERNMENT REGULATION AND PRICE CONSTRAINTS

PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES ARE SUBJECT TO EXTENSIVE REGULATION BY NUMEROUS

NATIONAL, STATE AND LOCAL AGENCIES. OF PARTICULAR IMPORTANCE IS THE FDA IN THE

UNITED STATES. IT HAS JURISDICTION OVER VIRTUALLY ALL OF OUR BUSINESSES AND

ADMINISTERS REQUIREMENTS COVERING THE TESTING, SAFETY, EFFECTIVENESS,

MANUFACTURING, LABELING, MARKETING, ADVERTISING AND POST-MARKETING SURVEILLANCE

OF OUR PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS. FDA REQUIREMENTS AND/OR REVIEWS HAVE INCREASED

THE AMOUNT OF TIME AND MONEY NECESSARY TO DEVELOP NEW PRODUCTS AND BRING THEM

TO MARKET.

THE FDA ALSO REGULATES MOST OF OUR CONSUMER HEALTHCARE PRODUCTS AND, ALONG

WITH THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE AND THE U.S. ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION

AGENCY, OUR ANIMAL HEALTH PRODUCTS.

SINCE

1998, THE APPROVAL OF NEW DRUGS ACROSS THE EUROPEAN UNION (EU) IS POSSIBLE ONLY USING

THE EUROPEAN MEDICINES EVALUATION AGENCYS (EMEA) MUTUAL RECOGNITION OR CENTRAL

APPROVAL PROCESSES. THE USE OF EITHER OF THESE PROCEDURES PROVIDES A MORE RAPID

AND CONSISTENT APPROVAL WITHIN THE 15 MEMBER STATES THAN WAS THE CASE WHEN THE

APPROVAL PROCESSES WERE OPERATING INDEPENDENTLY WITHIN EACH MEMBER STATE.

FURTHER, ON JANUARY 1, 2000, NORWAY AND ICELAND BECAME FULL PARTICIPANTS IN THE

EU CENTRAL APPROVAL PROCESSES. IN ADDITION, THE AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE EU AND 12

OTHER EUROPEAN STATES TO BASE THEIR APPROVALS ON THE CENTRALIZED EU APPROVAL

WILL SIGNIFICANTLY SPEED THE REGULATORY PROCESS IN THOSE COUNTRIES. THE EMEA

DOES NOT HAVE JURISDICTION OVER PATIENT REIMBURSEMENT OR PRICING MATTERS IN EU

MEMBER COUNTRIES, HOWEVER. WE CONTINUE TO DEAL WITH INDIVIDUAL COUNTRIES ON

SUCH ISSUES.

IN RECENT YEARS IN THE U.S., VARIOUS LEGISLATIVE PROPOSALS HAVE BEEN

OFFERED AT THE FEDERAL AND STATE LEVELS THAT WOULD BRING ABOUT MAJOR CHANGES IN

THE AFFECTED HEALTH CARE SYSTEMS. SOME STATES HAVE PASSED SUCH LEGISLATION, AND

FURTHER FEDERAL AND STATE PROPOSALS ARE POSSIBLE. SUCH PROPOSALS AND

LEGISLATION INCLUDE, AND FUTURE PROPOSALS COULD INCLUDE, PRICE CONTROLS OR

PATIENT ACCESS CONSTRAINTS ON MEDICINES AND INCREASES IN REQUIRED REBATES OR

DISCOUNTS. SIMILAR ISSUES EXIST

IN MANY FOREIGN COUNTRIES WHERE WE DO BUSINESS. WE CANNOT PREDICT THE OUTCOME

OF SUCH INITIATIVES, BUT WE WILL WORK TO MAINTAIN PATIENT ACCESS TO OUR

PRODUCTS AND TO OPPOSE PRICE CONSTRAINTS.

IN THE U.S., FEDERAL PROPOSALS HAVE CALLED FOR SUBSTANTIAL CHANGES IN THE

MEDICARE PROGRAM, AND FEDERAL AND STATE PROPOSALS HAVE CALLED FOR SUBSTANTIAL

CHANGES IN THE MEDICAID PROGRAM. DRIVEN BY BUDGET CONCERNS, MEDICAID ACCESS AND

REIMBURSEMENT RESTRICTIONS HAVE BEEN IMPLEMENTED IN SOME STATES AND PROPOSED IN

MANY OTHERS. IF THE MEDICARE AND MEDICAID PROGRAMS IMPLEMENT CHANGES THAT

RESTRICT THE ACCESS OF A SIGNIFICANT POPULATION OF PATIENTS TO OUR INNOVATIVE

MEDICINES, OUR BUSINESS COULD BE MATERIALLY AFFECTED. ON THE OTHER HAND,

RELATIVELY LITTLE PHARMACEUTICAL USE IS CURRENTLY COVERED BY MEDICARE. IF

CHANGES TO MEDICARE SHIFT PATIENTS TO MCOS THAT COVER

11

TABLE OF CONTENTS

PHARMACEUTICALS, OR IF AN OUTPATIENT DRUG BENEFIT IS ADDED TO MEDICARE,

USAGE OF PHARMACEUTICALS COULD INCREASE. PRICING PRESSURES LIKELY WOULD ENSUE

IN EITHER CASE GIVEN THE ENHANCEMENT OF THE PURCHASING POWER OF THE MCOS OR THE

FEDERAL GOVERNMENT.

MEDICARE CURRENTLY DOES NOT GENERALLY PROVIDE OUTPATIENT PRESCRIPTION DRUG

COVERAGE. IN THIS CONTEXT, IN ORDER TO HELP ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF AFFORDABLE

ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE FOR THOSE MOST IN NEED, WE INSTITUTED THE PFIZER FOR

LIVING SHARE CARD PROGRAM IN 2002. THROUGH THIS PROGRAM, LOW-INCOME MEDICARE

RECIPIENTS WITHOUT PRESCRIPTION DRUG COVERAGE CAN PURCHASE 30-DAY PRESCRIPTIONS

OF ANY PFIZER PRESCRIPTION MEDICINE AND OF THE COPROMOTED PRODUCT

ARICEPT

AT MANY RETAIL PHARMACIES FOR $15.

U.S. LAW REQUIRES US TO GIVE REBATES TO STATE MEDICAID AGENCIES BASED ON

EACH STATES REIMBURSEMENT OF PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS UNDER THE MEDICAID

PROGRAM. SOME STATES ARE SEEKING REBATES IN EXCESS OF THE AMOUNTS REQUIRED BY

FEDERAL LAW, AND THERE ARE FEDERAL LEGISLATIVE PROPOSALS TO EXPAND CURRENT

MEDICAID REBATES. WE ALSO MUST GIVE DISCOUNTS OR REBATES ON PURCHASES OR

REIMBURSEMENTS OF PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS BY CERTAIN OTHER FEDERAL AND STATE

AGENCIES AND PROGRAMS. IN 2000 AND 2001, THE STATES OF VERMONT AND MAINE

RECEIVED APPROVAL OF WAIVERS FROM THE CENTERS FOR MEDICARE AND MEDICAID

SERVICES THAT WOULD EXPAND MEDICAID REBATES BEYOND THE CURRENT MEDICAID

POPULATION. BOTH OF THESE WAIVERS WERE STRUCK DOWN BY FEDERAL APPEALS COURTS.

SEPARATELY, IN 2000 THE STATE OF MAINE PASSED LEGISLATION REQUIRING

PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES TO PROVIDE THE SAME PRICE DISCOUNTS TO RESIDENTS OF

THE STATE, REGARDLESS OF THEIR INCOME, WHO ARE NOT ELIGIBLE FOR MEDICAID AS ARE

PROVIDED TO MEDICAID PARTICIPANTS. IF A PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANY DECLINES TO

PROVIDE SUCH DISCOUNTS TO THE NON-MEDICAID POPULATION, IN MOST CASES DOCTORS

WILL NOT BE ALLOWED TO PRESCRIBE THAT COMPANYS DRUGS TO MEDICAID PATIENTS

WITHOUT OBTAINING PRIOR AUTHORIZATION FROM THE STATE. THE MAINE PROGRAM WAS

UPHELD BY A FEDERAL APPEALS COURT IN 2001. THAT DECISION HAS BEEN APPEALED TO

THE U.S. SUPREME COURT, AND A DECISION IS EXPECTED LATER THIS YEAR. IF THE

MAINE PROGRAM IS UPHELD ON APPEAL, OTHER STATES MAY ADOPT SIMILAR LEGISLATION

THAT WOULD EXTEND MEDICAID-LEVEL DISCOUNTS BEYOND THE CURRENT MEDICAID

POPULATION.

REBATES POTENTIALLY COULD BE VIEWED AS PRICE DISCOUNTS WITHOUT

APPRECIABLE INCREASES IN VOLUME AS AN OFFSET. SEE THE DISCUSSION REGARDING

REBATES ON PAGE 32 OF OUR 2002 ANNUAL REPORT, WHICH DISCUSSION IS INCORPORATED

BY REFERENCE.

WE ENCOUNTER SIMILAR REGULATORY AND LEGISLATIVE ISSUES IN MOST OTHER

COUNTRIES. IN EUROPE AND SOME OTHER INTERNATIONAL MARKETS, THE GOVERNMENT

PROVIDES HEALTH CARE AT LOW DIRECT COST TO CONSUMERS AND REGULATES

PHARMACEUTICAL PRICES OR PATIENT REIMBURSEMENT LEVELS TO CONTROL COSTS FOR THE

GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED HEALTH CARE SYSTEM. THIS INTERNATIONAL PATCHWORK OF PRICE

REGULATION HAS LED TO DIFFERENT PRICES AND SOME THIRD-PARTY TRADE IN OUR

PRODUCTS FROM MARKETS WITH LOWER PRICES. SUCH TRADE EXPLOITING PRICE

DIFFERENCES BETWEEN COUNTRIES CAN UNDERMINE OUR SALES IN MARKETS WITH HIGHER

PRICES.

IN OCTOBER 2002, THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION ANNOUNCED A REGULATORY INITIATIVE

RELATING TO PATENT LITIGATION PURSUANT TO THE 1984 DRUG PRICE COMPETITION AND

PATENT TERM RESTORATION ACT, KNOWN AS THE HATCH-WAXMAN ACT. UNDER THE

HATCH-WAXMAN ACT, IF A GENERIC DRUG COMPANY FILES AN ABBREVIATED NEW DRUG

APPLICATION (ANDA) WITH THE FDA AND A RESEARCH-BASED DRUG COMPANY PROMPTLY

FILES A LAWSUIT ALLEGING THAT THE GENERIC PRODUCT WOULD INFRINGE ONE OR MORE OF

ITS PATENTS, APPROVAL OF THE ANDA BY THE FDA AUTOMATICALLY IS STAYED FOR A

PERIOD OF UP TO 30 MONTHS. THE PROPOSED REGULATION WOULD PERMIT ONLY ONE SUCH

30-MONTH STAY PERIOD TO BE TRIGGERED BY A PATENT-INFRINGEMENT SUIT BETWEEN A

RESEARCH-BASED FIRM AND AN ANDA APPLICANT. THE PROPOSED REGULATION ALSO WOULD

CLARIFY THE TYPE OF PATENTS ELIGIBLE FOR LISTING IN THE FDAS ORANGE BOOK. A

FINAL FDA REGULATION IS ANTICIPATED THIS YEAR. IT ALSO IS POSSIBLE THAT

LEGISLATION AMENDING THE HATCH-WAXMAN ACT COULD BE ENACTED THIS YEAR. ONE

POSSIBLE AMENDMENT WOULD CODIFY THE BUSH ADMINISTRATIONS REGULATORY INITIATIVE

AND ALSO REQUIRE THAT SETTLEMENTS IN PATENT-CHALLENGE CASES BETWEEN

RESEARCH-BASED DRUG COMPANIES AND GENERIC DRUG COMPANIES BE REPORTED TO THE

FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION. OTHER PROPOSALS THAT WOULD BE DETRIMENTAL TO THE

INNOVATIVE PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY ALREADY HAVE BEEN INTRODUCED AND COULD BE

ENACTED.

IN ADDITION TO THE FDA, THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE AND THE U.S.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

PROTECTION AGENCY, WE ARE SUBJECT TO THE JURISDICTION OF VARIOUS OTHER

REGULATORY AND ENFORCEMENT DEPARTMENTS AND AGENCIES, SUCH AS THE DEPARTMENT OF

HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES, THE FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION AND THE DEPARTMENT OF

JUSTICE IN THE U.S. WE ARE, THEREFORE, SUBJECT TO POSSIBLE ADMINISTRATIVE AND

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND ACTIONS BY THOSE REGULATORY BODIES (SEE ITEM 3,

LEGAL

PROCEEDINGS

, BELOW). SUCH ACTIONS MAY INCLUDE PRODUCT RECALLS, SEIZURES AND

OTHER CIVIL AND CRIMINAL SANCTIONS. IN SOME CASES, WE HAVE INITIATED PRODUCT

RECALLS VOLUNTARILY.

IT IS DIFFICULT TO PREDICT THE FUTURE IMPACT OF THE BROAD AND EXPANDING

LEGISLATIVE AND REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS AFFECTING US.

ENVIRONMENTAL LAW COMPLIANCE

MOST OF OUR MANUFACTURING AND CERTAIN RESEARCH OPERATIONS ARE AFFECTED BY

FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS. WE HAVE MADE, AND INTEND TO

CONTINUE TO MAKE, NECESSARY EXPENDITURES FOR COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE LAWS.

WE ALSO ARE CLEANING UP ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINATION FROM PAST INDUSTRIAL

ACTIVITY AT CERTAIN SITES (SEE ITEM 3,

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

, BELOW). AS A RESULT,

WE INCURRED CAPITAL AND OPERATIONAL EXPENDITURES IN 2002 FOR ENVIRONMENTAL

PROTECTION AND CLEAN-UP OF CERTAIN PAST INDUSTRIAL ACTIVITY AS FOLLOWS.



ENVIRONMENT-RELATED CAPITAL EXPENDITURES  $47 MILLION ($2 MILLION OF WHICH

RELATED TO DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS)



OTHER ENVIRONMENT-RELATED EXPENSES  $146 MILLION ($3 MILLION OF WHICH

RELATED TO DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS)

WHILE WE CANNOT PREDICT WITH CERTAINTY THE FUTURE COSTS OF SUCH CLEAN-UP

ACTIVITIES, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES OR OPERATING COSTS FOR ENVIRONMENTAL

COMPLIANCE, WE DO NOT BELIEVE THEY WILL HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON OUR CAPITAL

EXPENDITURES, EARNINGS OR COMPETITIVE POSITION.

BANKING AND INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES

WE CONDUCT INTERNATIONAL BANKING OPERATIONS THROUGH A SUBSIDIARY, PFIZER

INTERNATIONAL BANK EUROPE (PIBE), BASED IN DUBLIN, IRELAND. PIBE, INCORPORATED

UNDER THE LAWS OF IRELAND, OPERATES UNDER A BANKING LICENSE FROM THE CENTRAL

BANK OF IRELAND. IT MAKES LOANS AND ACCEPTS DEPOSITS IN SEVERAL CURRENCIES IN

INTERNATIONAL MARKETS. PIBE IS AN ACTIVE EUROMARKET LENDER TO FINANCIALLY

STRONG BORROWERS THROUGH ITS PORTFOLIO OF LOANS AND MONEY MARKET INSTRUMENTS.

LOANS ARE MADE PRIMARILY ON A SHORT- AND MEDIUM-TERM BASIS, TYPICALLY WITH

FLOATING INTEREST RATES.

WE ALSO OWN AN INSURANCE OPERATION, THE KODIAK COMPANY LIMITED, WHICH

REINSURES CERTAIN ASSETS, INLAND TRANSPORT AND MARINE CARGO OF OUR

INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS.

FINANCIAL DATA FOR THESE SUBSIDIARIES ARE SET FORTH IN NOTE 5 TO OUR

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS,

THROUGHOUT THE WORLD.

PROPOSED ACQUISITION OF PHARMACIA CORPORATION

IN JULY 2002, WE ENTERED INTO AN AGREEMENT TO ACQUIRE PHARMACIA

CORPORATION (PHARMACIA), A GLOBAL PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANY. PHARMACIAS HUMAN

PHARMACEUTICALS INCLUDE PRIMARY CARE PRODUCTS (INCLUDING

CELEBREX

AND

BEXTRA

WHICH WE COPROMOTE WITH PHARMACIA, AND

DETROL

)

,

OPTHALMOLOGY CARE PRODUCTS

TABLE OF CONTENTS

OPERATES SEVERAL OTHER BUSINESSES, INCLUDING ANIMAL HEALTH AND CONSUMER

HEALTHCARE BUSINESSES.

IN DECEMBER 2002, SHAREHOLDERS OF BOTH PFIZER AND PHARMACIA APPROVED THE

PROPOSED ACQUISITION. IN FEBRUARY 2003, THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION APPROVED THE

TRANSACTION. ON MARCH 17, 2003, WE AND PHARMACIA ANNOUNCED THAT THE COMPANIES

HAVE REACHED AGREEMENT WITH THE STAFF OF THE FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION (FTC) ON

THE DIVESTITURES THAT WILL BE REQUIRED IN CONNECTION WITH THE PROPOSED

ACQUISITION AND THAT THE COMPANIES HAVE AGREEMENTS IN PLACE WITH BUYERS FOR ALL

OF THE ASSETS TO BE DIVESTED. THE PRODUCTS AND COMPOUNDS TO BE DIVESTED ARE NOT

MATERIAL, EITHER INDIVIDUALLY OR IN THE AGGREGATE, TO PFIZERS BUSINESS OR

OPERATIONS. ON MARCH 25, 2003, THE COMPANIES ANNOUNCED THAT THE

FTC STAFF HAS COMPLETED ITS REVIEW AND THAT A PROPOSED CONSENT DECREE

WILL BE FORWARDED TO

THE FTC FOR ACCEPTANCE AND PLACEMENT ON THE PUBLIC RECORD. BASED ON PAST FTC

PRACTICE, PFIZER ANTICIPATES THAT THIS PROCESS WILL RESULT IN THE CLOSING OF

THE TRANSACTION IN APRIL 2003.

THE PROPOSED ACQUISITION IS A STOCK-FOR-STOCK TRANSACTION VALUED AS OF THE

MERGER AGREEMENT DATE AT APPROXIMATELY $60 BILLION. UPON THE CLOSING, WE WILL

ISSUE APPROXIMATELY TWO BILLION SHARES OF PFIZER COMMON STOCK IN EXCHANGE FOR

ALL OF THE OUTSTANDING COMMON STOCK OF PHARMACIA. IN ADDITION, WE WILL EXCHANGE

A NEWLY CREATED CLASS OF PFIZER CONVERTIBLE PERPETUAL PREFERRED STOCK

(CONVERTIBLE INTO APPROXIMATELY 16 MILLION SHARES OF PFIZER COMMON STOCK) FOR A

SUBSTANTIALLY IDENTICAL CLASS OF PHARMACIA STOCK, AND WE WILL EXCHANGE OPTIONS

ON 1.4 SHARES OF PFIZER COMMON STOCK FOR EACH OUTSTANDING PHARMACIA OPTION.

CAUTIONARY FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT FUTURE RESULTS

(CAUTIONARY STATEMENTS UNDER THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT

OF 1995)

OUR DISCLOSURE AND ANALYSIS IN THIS REPORT AND IN OUR 2002 ANNUAL REPORT

TO SHAREHOLDERS CONTAIN SOME FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS THAT SET FORTH

ANTICIPATED RESULTS BASED ON MANAGEMENTS PLANS AND ASSUMPTIONS. FROM TIME TO

TIME, WE ALSO PROVIDE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS IN OTHER MATERIALS WE RELEASE

TO THE PUBLIC AS WELL AS ORAL FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS. SUCH STATEMENTS GIVE

OUR CURRENT EXPECTATIONS OR FORECASTS OF FUTURE EVENTS; THEY DO NOT RELATE

STRICTLY TO HISTORICAL OR CURRENT FACTS. WE HAVE TRIED, WHEREVER POSSIBLE, TO

IDENTIFY SUCH STATEMENTS BY USING WORDS SUCH AS ANTICIPATE, ESTIMATE,

EXPECT, PROJECT, INTEND, PLAN, BELIEVE, WILL AND SIMILAR

EXPRESSIONS IN CONNECTION WITH ANY DISCUSSION OF FUTURE OPERATING OR FINANCIAL

PERFORMANCE. IN PARTICULAR, THESE INCLUDE STATEMENTS RELATING TO FUTURE

ACTIONS, PROSPECTIVE PRODUCTS OR PRODUCT APPROVALS, FUTURE PERFORMANCE OR

RESULTS OF CURRENT AND ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS, SALES EFFORTS, EXPENSES, INTEREST

RATES, FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES, THE OUTCOME OF CONTINGENCIES, SUCH AS LEGAL

PROCEEDINGS, AND FINANCIAL RESULTS.

WE CANNOT GUARANTEE THAT ANY FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENT WILL BE REALIZED,

ALTHOUGH WE BELIEVE WE HAVE BEEN PRUDENT IN OUR PLANS AND ASSUMPTIONS.

ACHIEVEMENT OF FUTURE RESULTS IS SUBJECT TO RISKS, UNCERTAINTIES AND

POTENTIALLY INACCURATE ASSUMPTIONS. SHOULD KNOWN OR UNKNOWN RISKS OR

UNCERTAINTIES MATERIALIZE, OR SHOULD UNDERLYING ASSUMPTIONS PROVE INACCURATE,

ACTUAL RESULTS COULD VARY MATERIALLY FROM PAST RESULTS AND THOSE ANTICIPATED,

ESTIMATED OR PROJECTED. INVESTORS SHOULD BEAR THIS IN MIND AS THEY CONSIDER

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS.

WE UNDERTAKE NO OBLIGATION TO PUBLICLY UPDATE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS,

WHETHER AS A RESULT OF NEW INFORMATION, FUTURE EVENTS OR OTHERWISE. YOU ARE

ADVISED, HOWEVER, TO CONSULT ANY FURTHER DISCLOSURES WE MAKE ON RELATED

SUBJECTS IN OUR 10-Q AND 8-K REPORTS TO THE SEC. ALSO NOTE THAT WE PROVIDE THE

FOLLOWING CAUTIONARY DISCUSSION OF RISKS, UNCERTAINTIES AND POSSIBLY INACCURATE

ASSUMPTIONS RELEVANT TO OUR BUSINESSES. THESE ARE FACTORS THAT, INDIVIDUALLY OR

IN THE AGGREGATE, WE THINK COULD CAUSE OUR ACTUAL RESULTS TO DIFFER MATERIALLY

FROM EXPECTED AND HISTORICAL RESULTS. WE NOTE THESE FACTORS FOR INVESTORS AS

PERMITTED BY THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995. YOU SHOULD

UNDERSTAND THAT IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO PREDICT OR IDENTIFY ALL SUCH FACTORS.

CONSEQUENTLY, YOU SHOULD NOT CONSIDER THE FOLLOWING TO BE A COMPLETE DISCUSSION

OF ALL POTENTIAL RISKS OR UNCERTAINTIES.

14

TABLE OF CONTENTS

     BALANCING CURRENT GROWTH AND INVESTMENT FOR THE FUTURE REMAINS A MAJOR

CHALLENGE. OUR ONGOING INVESTMENTS IN NEW PRODUCT INTRODUCTIONS AND RESEARCH

AND DEVELOPMENT FOR FUTURE PRODUCTS COULD EXCEED CORRESPONDING SALES GROWTH.

THIS COULD PRODUCE HIGHER COSTS WITHOUT A PROPORTIONAL INCREASE IN REVENUES.

     IN THE U.S., MANY PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS ARE SUBJECT TO INCREASING PRICING

PRESSURES, WHICH COULD BE SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACTED BY THE OUTCOME OF THE CURRENT

NATIONAL DEBATE OVER MEDICARE REFORM. IF THE MEDICARE PROGRAM PROVIDED

OUTPATIENT PHARMACEUTICAL COVERAGE FOR ITS BENEFICIARIES, THE FEDERAL

GOVERNMENT, THROUGH ITS ENORMOUS PURCHASING POWER UNDER THE PROGRAM, COULD

DEMAND DISCOUNTS FROM PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES THAT MAY IMPLICITLY CREATE PRICE

CONTROLS ON PRESCRIPTION DRUGS. ON THE OTHER HAND, A MEDICARE DRUG

REIMBURSEMENT PROVISION MAY INCREASE THE VOLUME OF PHARMACEUTICAL DRUG

PURCHASES, OFFSETTING AT LEAST IN PART THESE POTENTIAL PRICE DISCOUNTS. IN

ADDITION, MCOS, MEDICAID AND OTHER GOVERNMENT AGENCIES CONTINUE TO SEEK PRICE

DISCOUNTS. GOVERNMENT EFFORTS TO REDUCE MEDICARE AND MEDICAID EXPENSES MAY

CONTINUE TO INCREASE THE USE OF MCOS. THIS MAY RESULT IN MANAGED CARES

INFLUENCING PRESCRIPTION DECISIONS FOR A LARGER SEGMENT OF THE POPULATION. IN

ADDITION, CERTAIN STATES HAVE PROPOSED AND CERTAIN OTHER STATES HAVE ADOPTED

VARIOUS PROGRAMS TO CONTROL PRICES FOR THEIR SENIORS DRUG PROGRAMS, INCLUDING

PRICE OR PATIENT REIMBURSEMENT CONSTRAINTS, RESTRICTIONS ON ACCESS TO CERTAIN

PRODUCTS, IMPORTATION FROM OTHER COUNTRIES AND BULK PURCHASING OF DRUGS.

WE ENCOUNTER SIMILAR REGULATORY AND LEGISLATIVE ISSUES IN MOST OTHER

COUNTRIES. IN EUROPE AND SOME OTHER INTERNATIONAL MARKETS, THE GOVERNMENT

PROVIDES HEALTH CARE AT LOW DIRECT COST TO CONSUMERS AND REGULATES

PHARMACEUTICAL PRICES OR PATIENT REIMBURSEMENT LEVELS TO CONTROL COSTS FOR THE

GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED HEALTH CARE SYSTEM. THIS INTERNATIONAL PATCHWORK OF PRICE

REGULATION HAS LED TO DIFFERENT PRICES AND SOME THIRD-PARTY TRADE IN OUR

PRODUCTS FROM MARKETS WITH LOWER PRICES. SUCH TRADE EXPLOITING PRICE

DIFFERENCES BETWEEN COUNTRIES CAN UNDERMINE OUR SALES IN MARKETS WITH HIGHER

PRICES.

AS A RESULT, IT IS EXPECTED THAT PRESSURES ON THE PRICING COMPONENT OF

OPERATING RESULTS WILL CONTINUE.

     35.9% OF OUR 2002 REVENUES AROSE FROM INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS, INCLUDING

6.1% FROM JAPAN. THESE INTERNATIONAL-BASED REVENUES AS WELL AS OUR SUBSTANTIAL

INTERNATIONAL ASSETS EXPOSE OUR REVENUES AND EARNINGS TO FOREIGN CURRENCY

EXCHANGE RATE CHANGES. IN ADDITION, OUR INTEREST-BEARING INVESTMENTS, LOANS AND

BORROWINGS ARE SUBJECT TO INTEREST RATE CHANGE RISK. THE RISKS OF SUCH CHANGES

AND THE MEASURES WE HAVE TAKEN TO HELP CONTAIN THOSE RISKS ARE DISCUSSED IN THE

SECTION ENTITLED

FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT

ON PAGES 40 AND 41 OF OUR 2002

ANNUAL REPORT. FOR ADDITIONAL DETAILS, SEE NOTE 6-D TO OUR CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS,

DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES

,

ON PAGES 53 AND 54 OF OUR 2002 ANNUAL REPORT. THOSE SECTIONS OF OUR 2002 ANNUAL

REPORT ARE INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE.

NOTWITHSTANDING OUR EFFORTS TO FORESEE AND MITIGATE THE EFFECTS OF CHANGES

IN FISCAL CIRCUMSTANCES, WE CANNOT PREDICT WITH CERTAINTY CHANGES IN CURRENCY

AND INTEREST RATES, INFLATION OR OTHER RELATED FACTORS AFFECTING OUR

BUSINESSES.

     OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS ALSO COULD BE AFFECTED BY CHANGES IN

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY LEGAL PROTECTIONS AND REMEDIES, TRADE REGULATIONS AND

PROCEDURES AND ACTIONS AFFECTING APPROVAL, PRODUCTION, PRICING, REIMBURSEMENT

AND MARKETING OF PRODUCTS, AS WELL AS BY UNSTABLE GOVERNMENTS AND LEGAL

SYSTEMS, INTERGOVERNMENTAL DISPUTES AND POSSIBLE NATIONALIZATION.

     COMPETITION FROM MANUFACTURERS OF GENERIC DRUGS IS A MAJOR CHALLENGE IN THE

U.S. AND IS GROWING INTERNATIONALLY. EXPIRATION OR LOSS OF PATENT PROTECTION

TYPICALLY LEADS TO SIGNIFICANT LOSS OF SALES IN THE U.S. MARKET. THE PATENTS

COVERING SEVERAL OF THE COMPANYS MEDICINES ARE BEING CHALLENGED BY GENERIC

DRUG MANUFACTURERS.

     RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES PARTICULARLY APPLY WITH RESPECT TO PRODUCT-RELATED

FORWARD-LOOKING

STATEMENTS. THE OUTCOME OF THE LENGTHY AND COMPLEX PROCESS OF IDENTIFYING NEW

COMPOUNDS AND DEVELOPING NEW PRODUCTS IS INHERENTLY

15

TABLE OF CONTENTS

UNCERTAIN. THERE CAN BE NO

ASSURANCE AS TO WHETHER OR WHEN WE WILL RECEIVE REGULATORY APPROVAL FOR NEW

PRODUCTS OR FOR NEW INDICATIONS OR DOSAGE FORMS FOR EXISTING PRODUCTS. THERE

ARE ALSO MANY CONSIDERATIONS THAT CAN AFFECT MARKETING OF PHARMACEUTICAL

PRODUCTS AROUND THE WORLD. REGULATORY DELAYS, THE INABILITY TO SUCCESSFULLY

COMPLETE CLINICAL TRIALS, CLAIMS AND CONCERNS ABOUT SAFETY AND EFFICACY, NEW

DISCOVERIES, PATENT DISPUTES AND CLAIMS ABOUT ADVERSE SIDE EFFECTS ARE A FEW OF

THE FACTORS THAT COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE REALIZATION OF RESEARCH AND

DEVELOPMENT AND PRODUCT-RELATED FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS.

     AS DISCUSSED ABOVE IN

MARKETING,

DECISIONS ABOUT RESEARCH STUDIES MADE EARLY

IN THE DEVELOPMENT PROCESS OF A DRUG CANDIDATE CAN HAVE A SUBSTANTIAL IMPACT ON

THE MARKETING STRATEGY ONCE THE DRUG RECEIVES APPROVAL. MORE DETAILED STUDIES

MAY DEMONSTRATE ADDITIONAL BENEFITS THAT CAN HELP IN THE MARKETING, BUT THEY

CONSUME TIME AND RESOURCES AND CAN DELAY SUBMITTING THE DRUG CANDIDATE FOR

INITIAL APPROVAL. WE TRY TO PLAN CLINICAL TRIALS PRUDENTLY, BUT THERE IS NO

GUARANTEE THAT A PROPER BALANCE OF SPEED AND TESTING WILL BE MADE IN EACH CASE.

THE QUALITY OF OUR DECISIONS IN THIS AREA COULD AFFECT OUR FUTURE RESULTS.

     DIFFICULTIES OR DELAYS IN PRODUCT MANUFACTURING OR MARKETING, INCLUDING, BUT

NOT LIMITED TO, THE INABILITY TO BUILD UP PRODUCTION CAPACITY COMMENSURATE WITH

DEMAND, OR THE FAILURE TO PREDICT MARKET DEMAND FOR, OR TO GAIN MARKET

ACCEPTANCE OF, APPROVED PRODUCTS, COULD AFFECT FUTURE RESULTS.

     WE CURRENTLY MARKET TEN PRODUCTS WITH ANNUAL SALES TO THIRD PARTIES EXCEEDING

$1 BILLION EACH.

LIPITOR, NORVASC, ZOLOFT, NEURONTIN, VIAGRA, ZITHROMAX,

ZYRTEC, DIFLUCAN

AND OUR COPROMOTED PRODUCTS

CELEBREX

AND

ARICEPT.

THOSE

PRODUCTS ACCOUNTED FOR ALMOST THREE-QUARTERS OF OUR 2002 REVENUES. IF THESE OR

ANY OF OUR OTHER MAJOR PRODUCTS WERE TO BECOME SUBJECT TO A PROBLEM SUCH AS

LOSS OF PATENT PROTECTION, UNEXPECTED SIDE EFFECTS, REGULATORY PROCEEDINGS,

PUBLICITY AFFECTING DOCTOR OR PATIENT CONFIDENCE OR PRESSURE FROM COMPETITIVE

PRODUCTS, OR IF A NEW, MORE EFFECTIVE TREATMENT SHOULD BE INTRODUCED, THE

IMPACT ON OUR REVENUES COULD BE SIGNIFICANT. THE PATENTS COVERING

LIPITOR,

NORVASC, NEURONTIN, DIFLUCAN AND ZOLOFT

ARE THE SUBJECT OF PENDING

LEGAL CHALLENGES. AN ACTION ALLEGING PATENT INFRINGEMENT WITH RESPECT

TO THE SALE OF

CELEBREX

(AS WELL AS

BEXTRA

) WAS DISMISSED ON

MARCH 5, 2003; THE PLAINTIFF IN THAT ACTION HAS APPEALED THE

DECISION.

     WE CANNOT PREDICT WITH ACCURACY THE TIMING OR IMPACT OF THE INTRODUCTION OF

COMPETITIVE PRODUCTS OR THEIR POSSIBLE FUTURE EFFECT ON OUR SALES. PRODUCTS

THAT COMPETE WITH OUR DRUGS, INCLUDING SOME OF OUR BEST-SELLING MEDICINES, ARE

LAUNCHED FROM TIME TO TIME, AND CERTAIN POTENTIALLY COMPETITIVE PRODUCTS ARE IN

VARIOUS STAGES OF DEVELOPMENT, SOME OF WHICH HAVE BEEN FILED FOR APPROVAL WITH

THE FDA.

     GROWTH IN COSTS AND EXPENSES, CHANGES IN PRODUCT MIX AND THE IMPACT OF

ACQUISITIONS, DIVESTITURES, RESTRUCTURINGS, PRODUCT WITHDRAWALS AND OTHER

UNUSUAL EVENTS THAT COULD RESULT FROM EVOLVING BUSINESS STRATEGIES, EVALUATION

OF ASSET REALIZATION AND ORGANIZATIONAL RESTRUCTURING COULD AFFECT FUTURE

RESULTS. SUCH RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES INCLUDE, IN PARTICULAR, OUR ABILITY TO

OBTAIN THE ANTICIPATED RESULTS AND SYNERGIES FROM OUR PROPOSED ACQUISITION OF

PHARMACIA AND THE INCREASED UNCERTAINTY CREATED BY THE INTEGRATION OF THE TWO

BUSINESSES AS WELL AS OUR ABILITY TO DIVEST AND THE TIMING OF THE DIVESTITURES

OF OUR REMAINING DISCONTINUED BUSINESSES AND PRODUCT LINES.

     OUR FUTURE RESULTS COULD BE AFFECTED BY CHANGES IN LAWS AND REGULATIONS,

INCLUDING CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING STANDARDS, TAXATION REQUIREMENTS (INCLUDING

TAX-RATE CHANGES, NEW TAX LAWS AND REVISED TAX LAW INTERPRETATIONS),

COMPETITION LAWS AND ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS IN THE U.S. AND OTHER COUNTRIES.

     OUR FUTURE RESULTS COULD BE AFFECTED BY CHANGES IN BUSINESS, POLITICAL AND

ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, INCLUDING THE COST AND AVAILABILITY OF INSURANCE, DUE TO

THE THREAT OF FUTURE TERRORIST ACTIVITY IN THE U.S. AND OTHER PARTS OF THE

WORLD AND RELATED U.S. MILITARY ACTION OVERSEAS.

     WE AND CERTAIN OF OUR SUBSIDIARIES ARE INVOLVED IN VARIOUS PATENT, PRODUCT

LIABILITY, CONSUMER, COMMERCIAL, ENVIRONMENTAL, AND TAX LITIGATIONS AND CLAIMS;

GOVERNMENT INVESTIGATIONS; AND OTHER LEGAL PROCEEDINGS THAT ARISE FROM TIME TO

TIME IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF OUR BUSINESS. WE DO NOT BELIEVE ANY OF THEM WILL

HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL POSITION. LITIGATION IS

INHERENTLY UNPREDICTABLE, AND EXCESSIVE VERDICTS DO OCCUR. ALTHOUGH WE BELIEVE

WE HAVE VALID DEFENSES IN THESE MATTERS, WE COULD IN THE FUTURE

INCUR JUDGMENTS OR ENTER INTO SETTLEMENTS OF CLAIMS THAT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL

ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN ANY PARTICULAR PERIOD.

16

TABLE OF CONTENTS

PATENT CLAIMS INCLUDE CHALLENGES TO THE COVERAGE AND/OR VALIDITY OF OUR

PATENTS ON VARIOUS PRODUCTS OR PROCESSES. ALTHOUGH WE BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE

VALID DEFENSES TO THESE CHALLENGES WITH RESPECT TO ALL OUR MATERIAL PATENTS,

THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE AS TO THE OUTCOME OF THESE MATTERS, AND A LOSS IN ANY

OF THESE CASES COULD RESULT IN A LOSS OF PATENT PROTECTION FOR THE DRUG AT

ISSUE, WHICH COULD LEAD TO A SIGNIFICANT LOSS OF SALES OF THAT DRUG AND COULD

MATERIALLY AFFECT FUTURE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

ITEM 2. PROPERTIES

OUR CORPORATE HEADQUARTERS AND THE HEADQUARTERS OF OUR HUMAN

PHARMACEUTICAL AND ANIMAL HEALTH BUSINESSES ARE LOCATED AT OUR WORLD

HEADQUARTERS, WHICH INCLUDES SEVERAL BUILDINGS IN NEW YORK CITY. WE OWN TWO OF

THE BUILDINGS, INCLUDING OUR MAIN, 33-STORY OFFICE TOWER AT 235 EAST

42

THE UNITED KINGDOM AND THE UNITED STATES. IN ADDITION, THE GLOBAL MANUFACTURING

DIVISION OPERATES NUMEROUS DISTRIBUTION FACILITIES IN MAJOR MARKETS AROUND THE

WORLD.

THE HEADQUARTERS AND RESEARCH OPERATIONS OF OUR CONSUMER HEALTHCARE

BUSINESS ARE LOCATED IN MORRIS PLAINS, NEW JERSEY, WHERE WE OWN FIVE BUILDINGS

AND LEASE A SMALLER AMOUNT OF SPACE NEARBY. CHCS SALES AND MARKETING OFFICES

ARE LOCATED IN LEASED SPACE, IN MANY CASES SHARED WITH OTHER BUSINESSES.

THE CAPSUGEL BUSINESS OPERATES MANUFACTURING AND DISTRIBUTION FACILITIES

IN TEN LOCATIONS AROUND THE WORLD.

OPERATES MANUFACTURING FACILITIES IN 24 LOCATIONS AROUND THE WORLD.

THE SCHICK-WILKINSON SWORD SHAVING PRODUCTS BUSINESS, WHICH WE ALSO

RECENTLY AGREED TO SELL, OPERATES MANUFACTURING FACILITIES IN FIVE LOCATIONS

AROUND THE WORLD.

IN GENERAL, OUR PROPERTIES ARE WELL MAINTAINED, ADEQUATE AND SUITABLE TO

THEIR PURPOSES. THE GROWTH OF OUR BUSINESSES HAS CREATED SPACE PRESSURES FOR

CERTAIN OPERATIONS, HOWEVER. WE HAVE RESPONDED TO SUCH CHALLENGES WITH PLANS

TO PROVIDE APPROPRIATE FACILITIES AS NEEDS ARE DEMONSTRATED. NOTE 8 TO OUR

PATENT MATTERS

NEURONTIN (GABAPENTIN)

AS PREVIOUSLY REPORTED, IN 2000, WARNER-LAMBERT BROUGHT PATENT

INFRINGEMENT SUITS AGAINST SEVERAL GENERIC MANUFACTURERS THAT HAVE FILED

ABBREVIATED NEW DRUG APPLICATIONS WITH THE FDA ASSERTING THE INVALIDITY AND

NON-INFRINGEMENT OF OUR GABAPENTIN (

NEURONTIN)

LOW-LACTAM PATENT. ONE OF THOSE

GENERIC MANUFACTURERS RECENTLY RECEIVED TENTATIVE APPROVAL FROM THE FDA TO

MARKET A GENERIC VERSION OF GABAPENTIN.

TENTATIVE APPROVAL MEANS THAT THIS

GENERIC MANUFACTURER CAN MARKET ITS PRODUCT AFTER THE EXPIRATION OF THE 180-DAY

MARKETING EXCLUSIVITY PERIOD IN FAVOR OF ONE OF THE OTHER GENERIC MANUFACTURERS

THAT HAS NOT YET RECEIVED FDA APPROVAL TO MARKET ITS GENERIC VERSION OF

GABAPENTIN.

LIPITOR (ATORVASTATIN)

IN FEBRUARY 2003, WE FILED SUIT IN THE U.S. DISTRICT COURT FOR THE

DISTRICT OF DELAWARE FOR INFRINGEMENT OF OUR BASIC PRODUCT PATENT FOR

ATORVASTATIN (

LIPITOR

) AGAINST A GENERIC MANUFACTURER THAT HAS FILED AN

ABBREVIATED NEW DRUG APPLICATION WITH THE FDA AND ASSERTED THAT ITS PRODUCT

WOULD NOT INFRINGE THE PATENT. OUR BASIC PRODUCT PATENT, INCLUDING THE

ADDITIONAL SIX-MONTH PEDIATRIC EXCLUSIVITY PERIOD, EXPIRES IN 2010.

SUBSEQUENTLY, THE GENERIC MANUFACTURER ASSERTED THAT OUR PATENT COVERING THE

ACTIVE ENANTIOMERIC FORM OF THE DRUG IS INVALID; THAT PATENT, INCLUDING THE

SIX-MONTH PEDIATRIC EXCLUSIVITY PERIOD, EXPIRES IN 2011.

CELEBREX, BEXTRA (CELECOXIB, VALDECOXIB)

IN THE PREVIOUSLY REPORTED PATENT INFRINGEMENT ACTION BROUGHT BY THE

THE UNIVERSITY RECENTLY APPEALED THE COURTS DECISION GRANTING OUR

MOTIONS FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT.

OTHER MATTERS

NEURONTIN

AS PREVIOUSLY REPORTED, THE U.S. ATTORNEYS OFFICE IN BOSTON,

MASSACHUSETTS HAS BEEN CONDUCTING AN INVESTIGATION INTO WARNER-LAMBERTS
