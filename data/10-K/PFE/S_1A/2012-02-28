BELOW.

WORLDWIDE REVENUES FROM BIOPHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS

IN 2011 WERE $57.7 BILLION, A DECREASE OF 1% COMPARED TO 2010, PRIMARILY DUE TO THE DECREASE OF $4.7 BILLION IN OPERATIONAL REVENUES FROM

LIPITOR

,

EFFEXOR

,

PROTONIX

,

XALATAN

,

CADUET

,

VFEND

,

AROMASIN

AND

ZOSYN

,

AND LOWER ALLIANCE REVENUES FOR

ARICEPT

, ALL DUE TO LOSS OF EXCLUSIVITY IN CERTAIN MARKETS, AND A REDUCTION IN REVENUES OF $359 MILLION DUE TO THE PATIENT PROTECTION AND AFFORDABLE CARE ACT, AS AMENDED BY THE HEALTH

CARE AND EDUCATION RECONCILIATION ACT (COMMONLY REFERRED TO AS THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT, OR ACA). THIS DECREASE WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE SOLID PERFORMANCE OF

LYRICA

, THE

PREVNAR/PREVENAR

FRANCHISE AND

ENBREL

, THE INCLUSION OF

OPERATIONAL REVENUES FROM LEGACY KING PRODUCTS OF APPROXIMATELY $950 MILLION, WHICH FAVORABLY IMPACTED BIOPHARMACEUTICAL REVENUES BY 2%, AND THE FAVORABLE IMPACT OF FOREIGN EXCHANGE OF $1.7 BILLION, OR 3%.

GEOGRAPHICALLY, IN THE U.S., REVENUES FROM BIOPHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS DECREASED 9% IN 2011, COMPARED TO 2010, REFLECTING LOWER REVENUES

FROM

LIPITOR

,

PROTONIX

,

EFFEXOR

,

ZOSYN

,

XALATAN

,

VFEND

,

CADUET

AND

AROMASIN

ARICEPT

5MG AND 10MG

TABLETS IN NOVEMBER 2010 AND LOWER REVENUES FROM

DETROL/DETROL LA

, AS WELL AS THE REDUCTION IN REVENUES OF $359 MILLION IN 2011 DUE TO THE ACA. THE IMPACT OF THESE ADVERSE FACTORS WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE STRONG PERFORMANCE OF CERTAIN

OTHER BIOPHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS AND THE ADDITION OF U.S. REVENUES FROM LEGACY KING PRODUCTS OF APPROXIMATELY $904 MILLION IN 2011.

LIPITOR

LOST EXCLUSIVITY IN AUSTRALIA IN FEBRUARY 2012; IN JAPAN IN 2011; AND IN BRAZIL, CANADA, SPAIN AND MEXICO IN 2010; AND IT HAS LOST EXCLUSIVITY IN NEARLY ALL EMERGING MARKET COUNTRIES. WE DO NOT EXPECT THAT

, AND IN THE EUROPEAN UNION (EU) AND MANY OTHER INTERNATIONAL MARKETS FOR THE PREVENTION OF INVASIVE PNEUMOCOCCAL DISEASE, OTITIS MEDIA AND PNEUMOCOCCAL PNEUMONIA

CAUSED BY THE VACCINE SEROTYPES. THE LAUNCH OF THE

PREVNAR 13/PREVENAR 13

PEDIATRIC INDICATION HAS REDUCED OUR

PREVNAR/PREVENAR (7-VALENT)

REVENUES (SEE DISCUSSION BELOW), AND WE EXPECT THIS TREND TO CONTINUE. IN ADDITION, IN 2011, WE

RECEIVED APPROVAL OF

PREVNAR 13/PREVENAR 13

PREVNAR 13

ADULT INDICATION UNDER ITS ACCELERATED APPROVAL PROGRAM. CAPITA IS AN EFFICACY TRIAL INVOLVING SUBJECTS 65 YEARS OF AGE AND OLDER

THAT IS DESIGNED TO EVALUATE WHETHER

PREVNAR 13

IS EFFECTIVE IN PREVENTING THE FIRST EPISODE OF COMMUNITY-ACQUIRED PNEUMONIA CAUSED BY THE SEROTYPES CONTAINED IN THE VACCINE. WE ESTIMATE THAT THIS EVENT-DRIVEN TRIAL WILL BE COMPLETED IN 2013.

AT ITS REGULAR MEETING HELD ON FEBRUARY 22, 2012, THE U.S. CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTIONS ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON IMMUNIZATION PRACTICES (ACIP) INDICATED THAT IT WILL DEFER VOTING ON A RECOMMENDATION FOR THE ROUTINE USE OF

PREVNAR 13

IN ADULTS 50 YEARS OF AGE AND OLDER UNTIL THE RESULTS OF CAPITA, AS WELL AS DATA ON THE IMPACT OF PEDIATRIC USE OF

PREVNAR 13

ON THE DISEASE BURDEN AND SEROTYPE DISTRIBUTION AMONG ADULTS, ARE AVAILABLE. WE EXPECT THAT THE

RATE OF UPTAKE FOR THE USE OF

PREVNAR 13

IN ADULTS 50 YEARS OF AGE AND OLDER WILL BE IMPACTED BY ACIPS DECISION TO DEFER VOTING ON A RECOMMENDATION FOR THE ROUTINE USE OF

PREVNAR 13

BY THAT POPULATION.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

INNOVATION BY OUR

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT OPERATIONS IS VERY IMPORTANT TO OUR SUCCESS. AS A RESULT, AND ALSO BECAUSE WE ARE PREDOMINANTLY A HUMAN HEALTH COMPANY, THE VAST MAJORITY OF OUR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT SPENDING IS ASSOCIATED WITH HUMAN HEALTH PRODUCTS,

COMPOUNDS AND ACTIVITIES. OUR GOAL IS TO DISCOVER, DEVELOP AND BRING TO MARKET INNOVATIVE PRODUCTS THAT ADDRESS MAJOR UNMET MEDICAL NEEDS. WE SPENT $9.1 BILLION IN 2011, $9.4 BILLION IN 2010 AND $7.8 BILLION IN 2009 ON RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT.

ALSO SEEK OUT PROMISING COMPOUNDS AND INNOVATIVE TECHNOLOGIES DEVELOPED BY THIRD PARTIES TO INCORPORATE INTO OUR DISCOVERY AND DEVELOPMENT PROCESSES OR PROJECTS, AS WELL AS OUR PRODUCT LINES, THROUGH COLLABORATIONS, ALLIANCE AND LICENSE AGREEMENTS,

ACQUISITIONS AND OTHER ARRANGEMENTS.

TO THE PHARMACEUTICAL RESEARCH AND MANUFACTURERS OF AMERICA (PHRMA), OUT OF 5,000-10,000 SCREENED COMPOUNDS, ONLY 250 ENTER PRECLINICAL TESTING, FIVE ENTER HUMAN CLINICAL TRIALS AND ONE IS APPROVED BY THE FDA. THE PROCESS FROM EARLY DISCOVERY OR

DESIGN TO DEVELOPMENT TO REGULATORY APPROVAL CAN TAKE MORE THAN TEN YEARS. DRUG CANDIDATES CAN FAIL AT ANY STAGE OF THE PROCESS. CANDIDATES MAY NOT RECEIVE REGULATORY APPROVAL EVEN AFTER MANY YEARS OF RESEARCH.

AS OF YEAR-END 2011, WE HAD 262 PROJECTS IN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, RANGING FROM DISCOVERY THROUGH REGISTRATION, OF WHICH 95 PROGRAMS

ARE IN PHASE 1 THROUGH REGISTRATION, WITH THE REMAINDER OF THE PROJECTS IN PRE-CLINICAL DEVELOPMENT. AT YEAR-END 2011, OUR PHASE III PORTFOLIO CONTAINED 22 PROGRAMS. DEVELOPMENT OF A SINGLE COMPOUND IS OFTEN PURSUED AS PART OF MULTIPLE DIFFERENT

PROGRAMS. WHILE THESE NEW CANDIDATES MAY OR MAY NOT EVENTUALLY RECEIVE REGULATORY APPROVAL, NEW DRUG CANDIDATES ENTERING CLINICAL DEVELOPMENT PHASES ARE THE FOUNDATION FOR FUTURE PRODUCTS.

IN ADDITION TO DISCOVERING AND DEVELOPING NEW PRODUCTS, OUR RESEARCH OPERATIONS SEEK TO ADD VALUE TO OUR EXISTING PRODUCTS BY IMPROVING

THEIR EFFECTIVENESS AND BY DISCOVERING NEW USES OR INDICATIONS FOR THEM.

OUR COMPETITORS ALSO DEVOTE SUBSTANTIAL FUNDS AND RESOURCES TO RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT. WE

ALSO COMPETE AGAINST NUMEROUS SMALL BIOTECHNOLOGY COMPANIES IN DEVELOPING POTENTIAL DRUG CANDIDATES. THE EXTENT TO WHICH OUR COMPETITORS ARE SUCCESSFUL IN THEIR RESEARCH COULD RESULT IN EROSION OF THE SALES OF OUR EXISTING PRODUCTS AND PRODUCTS IN

DEVELOPMENT, AS WELL AS UNANTICIPATED PRODUCT OBSOLESCENCE.

WE CONTINUE TO CLOSELY EVALUATE OUR GLOBAL RESEARCH AND

DEVELOPMENT FUNCTION AND PURSUE STRATEGIES TO IMPROVE INNOVATION AND OVERALL PRODUCTIVITY BY PRIORITIZING AREAS WITH THE GREATEST SCIENTIFIC AND COMMERCIAL PROMISE, UTILIZING APPROPRIATE RISK/RETURN PROFILES, AND FOCUSING ON AREAS WITH THE HIGHEST

POTENTIAL TO DELIVER VALUE IN THE NEAR TERM AND OVER TIME. TO THAT END, OUR RESEARCH PRIMARILY FOCUSES ON FIVE HIGH-PRIORITY AREAS THAT HAVE A MIX OF SMALL AND LARGE MOLECULES  IMMUNOLOGY AND INFLAMMATION; ONCOLOGY; CARDIOVASCULAR, METABOLIC

AND ENDOCRINE DISEASES; NEUROSCIENCE AND PAIN; AND VACCINES. IN ADDITION TO REDUCING THE NUMBER OF DISEASE AREAS OF FOCUS, WE ARE REALIGNING AND REDUCING OUR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT FOOTPRINT, AND OUTSOURCING CERTAIN FUNCTIONS THAT DO NOT DRIVE

COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE FOR PFIZER. AS A RESULT OF THESE ACTIONS, WE EXPECT SIGNIFICANT REDUCTIONS IN OUR ANNUAL RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES, WHICH ARE REFLECTED IN OUR 2012 FINANCIAL GUIDANCE, AND WE EXPECT TO INCUR SIGNIFICANT COSTS, WHICH ARE

ALSO REFLECTED IN OUR 2012 FINANCIAL GUIDANCE. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION, SEE THE

INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS

WE HAVE SIGNIFICANT OPERATIONS OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES. THEY ARE MANAGED THROUGH THE SAME SEGMENTS AS OUR U.S.

OPERATIONS, WITH OUR OPERATIONS IN EMERGING MARKETS FOR HUMAN PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS MANAGED THROUGH THE ESTABLISHED PRODUCTS AND EMERGING MARKETS SEGMENT.

REVENUES FROM OPERATIONS OUTSIDE THE U.S. OF $40.5 BILLION ACCOUNTED FOR 60% OF OUR TOTAL REVENUES IN 2011. REVENUES EXCEEDED $500 MILLION IN EACH OF 18 COUNTRIES OUTSIDE THE U.S. IN 2011. THE U.S. IS OUR

LARGEST NATIONAL MARKET, COMPRISING 40% OF TOTAL REVENUES IN 2011, 43% OF TOTAL REVENUES IN 2010 AND 44% OF TOTAL REVENUES IN 2009. JAPAN IS OUR SECOND-LARGEST NATIONAL MARKET, WITH 9% OF TOTAL REVENUES IN 2011, 7.5% OF TOTAL REVENUES IN 2010 AND

8.7% OF TOTAL REVENUES IN 2009.

OUR INTERNATIONAL BUSINESSES ARE SUBJECT, IN VARYING DEGREES, TO A NUMBER OF RISKS INHERENT IN CARRYING ON BUSINESS IN OTHER COUNTRIES. THESE INCLUDE CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS, CAPITAL AND EXCHANGE CONTROL

REGULATIONS, EXPROPRIATION AND OTHER RESTRICTIVE GOVERNMENT ACTIONS. OUR INTERNATIONAL BUSINESSES ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO GOVERNMENT-IMPOSED CONSTRAINTS, INCLUDING LAWS AND REGULATIONS ON PRICING, REIMBURSEMENT, AND ACCESS TO OUR PRODUCTS. SEE

GOVERNMENT REGULATION AND PRICE CONSTRAINTS

BELOW FOR A DISCUSSION OF THESE MATTERS.

DEPENDING ON THE DIRECTION OF

CHANGE RELATIVE TO THE U.S. DOLLAR, FOREIGN CURRENCY VALUES CAN INCREASE OR DECREASE THE REPORTED DOLLAR VALUE OF OUR NET ASSETS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. IN 2011, BOTH REVENUES AND NET INCOME WERE FAVORABLY IMPACTED BY FOREIGN EXCHANGE IN GENERAL,

AS FOREIGN CURRENCY MOVEMENTS RELATIVE TO THE U.S. DOLLAR INCREASED OUR REVENUES AND NET INCOME IN MANY COUNTRIES. WHILE WE CANNOT PREDICT WITH CERTAINTY FUTURE CHANGES IN FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES OR THE EFFECT THEY WILL HAVE ON US, WE ATTEMPT TO

MITIGATE THEIR IMPACT THROUGH OPERATIONAL MEANS AND BY USING VARIOUS FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, DEPENDING UPON MARKET CONDITIONS. SEE THE DISCUSSIONS IN THE NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

MARKETING

IN OUR GLOBAL BIOPHARMACEUTICAL BUSINESSES, WE PROMOTE OUR PRODUCTS TO HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS AND PATIENTS. THROUGH OUR MARKETING

ORGANIZATIONS, WE EXPLAIN THE APPROVED USES, BENEFITS AND RISKS OF OUR PRODUCTS TO HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS, SUCH AS DOCTORS, NURSE PRACTITIONERS, PHYSICIAN ASSISTANTS, PHARMACISTS, HOSPITALS, PHARMACY BENEFIT MANAGERS (PBMS), MANAGED CARE ORGANIZATIONS

(MCOS), EMPLOYERS AND GOVERNMENT AGENCIES. WE ALSO MARKET DIRECTLY TO CONSUMERS IN THE U.S. THROUGH DIRECT-TO-CONSUMER ADVERTISING THAT COMMUNICATES THE APPROVED USES, BENEFITS AND RISKS OF OUR PRODUCTS WHILE MOTIVATING PEOPLE TO HAVE MEANINGFUL

CONVERSATIONS WITH THEIR DOCTORS. IN ADDITION, WE SPONSOR GENERAL ADVERTISING TO EDUCATE THE PUBLIC ON DISEASE AWARENESS, PREVENTION AND WELLNESS, IMPORTANT PUBLIC HEALTH ISSUES, AND OUR PATIENT ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS.

OUR BIOPHARMACEUTICAL BUSINESSES INCLUDE FIVE HUMAN HEALTH, CUSTOMER-FOCUSED BUSINESS UNITS: PRIMARY CARE, SPECIALTY CARE, ONCOLOGY,

ESTABLISHED PRODUCTS AND EMERGING MARKETS. OUR SPECIALTY CARE CUSTOMER-FOCUSED BUSINESS UNIT INCLUDES VACCINES. WE OPERATE IN CUSTOMER-FOCUSED BUSINESS UNITS WITHIN OUR BIOPHARMACEUTICAL BUSINESSES TO BETTER MEET THE DIVERSE NEEDS OF PHYSICIANS,

PATIENTS AND OUR CUSTOMERS WHILE MAXIMIZING VALUE FOR OUR COMPANY AND OUR SHAREHOLDERS.

OUR U.S. PRIMARY CARE OPERATIONS ARE

STRUCTURED INTO REGIONAL UNITS IN ORDER TO CREATE A MORE FLEXIBLE ORGANIZATION EMPOWERED TO IDENTIFY AND ADDRESS LOCAL MARKET DYNAMICS AND CUSTOMER NEEDS. OUR STRUCTURE ALIGNS THE SALES, MARKETING, AND MEDICAL FUNCTIONS TO WORK CLOSELY TO MEET THE

NEEDS OF KEY CUSTOMER GROUPS WHILE ENSURING COMMON COORDINATION, FOCUS AND ACCOUNTABILITY ACROSS THE ORGANIZATIONS.

OUR

PRESCRIPTION PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS ARE SOLD PRINCIPALLY TO WHOLESALERS, BUT WE ALSO SELL DIRECTLY TO RETAILERS, HOSPITALS, CLINICS, GOVERNMENT AGENCIES AND PHARMACIES, AND IN THE CASE OF

PREVNAR 13

, DIRECTLY TO INDIVIDUAL PROVIDER OFFICES

IN THE U.S. WE SEEK TO GAIN ACCESS TO HEALTHCARE AUTHORITY, PBM AND MCO FORMULARIES (LISTS OF RECOMMENDED, APPROVED, AND/OR REIMBURSED MEDICINES AND OTHER PRODUCTS). WE ALSO WORK WITH MCOS, PBMS, EMPLOYERS AND OTHER APPROPRIATE HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS

TO ASSIST THEM WITH DISEASE MANAGEMENT, PATIENT EDUCATION AND OTHER TOOLS THAT HELP THEIR MEDICAL TREATMENT ROUTINES.

DURING

2011, PFIZER REVENUES FROM OUR THREE LARGEST BIOPHARMACEUTICAL WHOLESALERS WERE AS FOLLOWS.



MCKESSON, INC.13% OF OUR TOTAL REVENUES (AND 30% OF OUR TOTAL U.S. REVENUES);



CARDINAL HEALTH, INC.10% OF OUR TOTAL REVENUES (AND 26% OF OUR TOTAL U.S. REVENUES); AND



AMERISOURCEBERGEN CORPORATION9% OF OUR TOTAL REVENUES (AND 21% OF OUR TOTAL U.S. REVENUES).

SALES TO THESE WHOLESALERS WERE CONCENTRATED IN THE BIOPHARMACEUTICAL BUSINESSES. APART FROM THESE INSTANCES, NONE OF OUR OPERATING

SEGMENTS IS DEPENDENT ON ANY ONE CUSTOMER OR GROUP OF RELATED CUSTOMERS.

EACH OF OUR GLOBAL ANIMAL HEALTH, CONSUMER

HEALTHCARE AND NUTRITION BUSINESS UNITS UTILIZES ITS OWN SALES AND MARKETING ORGANIZATIONS TO PROMOTE ITS PRODUCTS, AND EACH OCCASIONALLY USES DISTRIBUTORS IN SMALLER MARKETS.

OUR ANIMAL HEALTH BUSINESS UNITS ADVERTISING AND PROMOTIONS ARE GENERALLY TARGETED TO VETERINARY HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONALS. ANIMAL HEALTH PRODUCTS ARE SOLD DIRECTLY TO VETERINARIANS AND LIVESTOCK

PRODUCERS, AS WELL AS THROUGH DISTRIBUTORS AND RETAIL OUTLETS.

OUR CONSUMER HEALTHCARE BUSINESS UNITS ADVERTISING AND

PROMOTIONS ARE GENERALLY DISSEMINATED TO CONSUMERS THROUGH TELEVISION, PRINT, DIGITAL AND OTHER MEDIA ADVERTISING, AS WELL AS THROUGH IN-STORE PROMOTION. CONSUMER HEALTHCARE PRODUCTS ARE SOLD THROUGH A WIDE VARIETY OF CHANNELS, INCLUDING

DISTRIBUTORS, PHARMACIES, RETAIL CHAINS AND GROCERY AND CONVENIENCE STORES.

OUR NUTRITION BUSINESS UNIT FULLY SUPPORTS AND

ADHERES TO THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION CODE AND NATIONAL CODES ON THE MARKETING OF BREAST MILK SUBSTITUTES. PFIZER NUTRITION ENCOURAGES BREASTFEEDING AS THE BEST NUTRITION

12

FOR INFANTS AND PROVIDES IMPORTANT PRODUCTS FOR INFANTS WHO ARE NOT EXCLUSIVELY BREASTFED. ADVERTISING AND PROMOTION OF OUR NUTRITION PRODUCTS ADHERE TO THE AIM AND PRINCIPLES OF THE WORLD HEALTH

ORGANIZATION CODE AS A MINIMUM STANDARD, CONSISTENT WITH NATIONAL LEGISLATION. CONSEQUENTLY, WE DO NOT ADVERTISE BREAST MILK SUBSTITUTES, BUT RATHER PRODUCTS INTENDED FOR OLDER CHILDREN AND ADULTS, WHERE PERMITTED. SUCH ACTIVITIES ARE AIMED AT

HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONALS AND CONSUMERS THROUGH MEDIA ADVERTISING (PRINT, TELEVISION, INTERNET). OUR NUTRITION PRODUCTS ARE AVAILABLE TO CONSUMERS IN A WIDE VARIETY OF CHANNELS, INCLUDING PHARMACIES, HOSPITALS AND FOOD RETAILERS (SUPERMARKETS,

GROCERY STORES AND CONVENIENCE STORES).

PATENTS AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS

OUR PRODUCTS ARE SOLD AROUND THE WORLD UNDER BRAND-NAME, LOGO AND CERTAIN PRODUCT DESIGN TRADEMARKS THAT WE CONSIDER IN THE AGGREGATE TO

BE OF MATERIAL IMPORTANCE. TRADEMARK PROTECTION CONTINUES IN SOME COUNTRIES FOR AS LONG AS THE MARK IS USED AND, IN OTHER COUNTRIES, FOR AS LONG AS IT IS REGISTERED. REGISTRATIONS GENERALLY ARE FOR FIXED, BUT RENEWABLE, TERMS.

WE OWN OR LICENSE A NUMBER OF U.S. AND FOREIGN PATENTS. THESE PATENTS COVER PHARMACEUTICAL AND OTHER PRODUCTS AND THEIR USES,

PHARMACEUTICAL FORMULATIONS, PRODUCT MANUFACTURING PROCESSES AND INTERMEDIATE CHEMICAL COMPOUNDS USED IN MANUFACTURING.

PATENTS FOR INDIVIDUAL PRODUCTS EXTEND FOR VARYING PERIODS ACCORDING TO THE DATE OF PATENT FILING OR GRANT AND THE LEGAL TERM OF PATENTS

IN THE VARIOUS COUNTRIES WHERE PATENT PROTECTION IS OBTAINED. THE ACTUAL PROTECTION AFFORDED BY A PATENT, WHICH CAN VARY FROM COUNTRY TO COUNTRY, DEPENDS UPON THE TYPE OF PATENT, THE SCOPE OF ITS COVERAGE AND THE AVAILABILITY OF LEGAL REMEDIES IN

THE COUNTRY. FURTHER, PATENT TERM EXTENSION MAY BE AVAILABLE IN MANY MAJOR COUNTRIES TO COMPENSATE FOR A REGULATORY DELAY IN APPROVAL OF THE PRODUCT.

IN THE AGGREGATE, OUR PATENT AND RELATED RIGHTS ARE OF MATERIAL IMPORTANCE TO OUR BUSINESSES IN THE U.S. AND MOST OTHER COUNTRIES. BASED ON CURRENT PRODUCT SALES, AND CONSIDERING THE VIGOROUS COMPETITION

WITH PRODUCTS SOLD BY OTHERS, THE PATENT RIGHTS WE CONSIDER MOST SIGNIFICANT IN RELATION TO OUR BUSINESS AS A WHOLE, TOGETHER WITH THE YEAR IN WHICH THE U.S. BASIC PRODUCT PATENT EXPIRES (INCLUDING, WHERE APPLICABLE, THE ADDITIONAL SIX-MONTH

PEDIATRIC EXCLUSIVITY PERIOD AND/OR THE GRANTED PATENT TERM EXTENSION), ARE THOSE FOR THE DRUGS SET FORTH IN THE TABLE BELOW. THE BASIC PATENTS FOR THESE PRODUCTS IN OTHER LARGE MARKETS MAY EXPIRE IN THE SAME, EARLIER OR LATER YEARS.

IN THE U.S. ON NOVEMBER 30, 2011. PFIZER ANNOUNCED IN JUNE 2008 THAT WE ENTERED INTO AN

AGREEMENT PROVIDING A LICENSE TO RANBAXY TO SELL GENERIC VERSIONS OF

LIPITOR

AND

CADUET

IN THE U.S EFFECTIVE NOVEMBER 30, 2011. IN ADDITION, THE AGREEMENT PROVIDES A LICENSE FOR RANBAXY TO SELL A GENERIC VERSION OF

LIPITOR

BEGINNING ON VARYING DATES IN SEVERAL ADDITIONAL COUNTRIES. (SEE THE NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

NOTE 17. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

FOR A DISCUSSION OF CERTAIN LITIGATION RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT.) WE ALSO

GRANTED WATSON PHARMACEUTICALS, INC. (WATSON) THE EXCLUSIVE RIGHT TO SELL THE AUTHORIZED GENERIC VERSION OF

LIPITOR

IN THE U.S. FOR A PERIOD OF FIVE YEARS, WHICH COMMENCED ON NOVEMBER 30, 2011. AS WATSONS EXCLUSIVE SUPPLIER, WE

MANUFACTURE AND SELL GENERIC ATORVASTATIN TABLETS TO WATSON. WE EXPECT THE ENTRY OF MULTI-SOURCE GENERIC COMPETITION IN THE U.S., WITH ATTENDANT INCREASED COMPETITIVE PRESSURES, FOLLOWING THE END OF RANBAXYS 180-DAY GENERIC EXCLUSIVITY PERIOD

IN LATE MAY 2012. IN MARKETS OUTSIDE THE U.S.,

LIPITOR

HAS LOST EXCLUSIVITY IN CERTAIN COUNTRIES AND WILL LOSE EXCLUSIVITY AT VARIOUS TIMES IN OTHER COUNTRIES. IN EUROPE, ALTHOUGH THE

THE EXPIRATION OF A BASIC PRODUCT PATENT OR LOSS OF PATENT PROTECTION RESULTING FROM A LEGAL CHALLENGE NORMALLY RESULTS IN SIGNIFICANT COMPETITION FROM GENERIC PRODUCTS AGAINST THE ORIGINALLY PATENTED

PRODUCT AND CAN RESULT IN A SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN SALES OF THAT PRODUCT IN A VERY SHORT PERIOD. IN SOME CASES, HOWEVER, WE CAN CONTINUE TO OBTAIN COMMERCIAL BENEFITS FROM PRODUCT MANUFACTURING TRADE SECRETS; PATENTS ON USES FOR PRODUCTS; PATENTS

ON PROCESSES AND INTERMEDIATES FOR THE ECONOMICAL MANUFACTURE OF THE ACTIVE INGREDIENTS; PATENTS FOR SPECIAL FORMULATIONS OF THE PRODUCT OR DELIVERY MECHANISMS; AND CONVERSION OF THE ACTIVE INGREDIENT TO OVER-THE-COUNTER PRODUCTS.

OUR BIOTECHNOLOGY PRODUCTS, INCLUDING

ENBREL

AND THE

PREVNAR

FAMILY,

MAY FACE COMPETITION FROM BIOSIMILARS (ALSO REFERRED TO AS FOLLOW-ON BIOLOGICS). SUCH BIOSIMILARS WOULD REFERENCE BIOTECHNOLOGY PRODUCTS ALREADY APPROVED UNDER THE U.S. PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICE ACT. ABBREVIATED LEGAL PATHWAYS FOR THE

APPROVAL OF BIOSIMILARS EXIST IN CERTAIN INTERNATIONAL MARKETS AND SINCE THE PASSAGE OF THE ACA, A FRAMEWORK FOR SUCH APPROVAL EXISTS IN THE U.S. SEE

GOVERNMENT REGULATION AND PRICE CONSTRAINTS  BIOSIMILARS

BELOW. SPECIFICALLY, THE ACA

PROVIDED INNOVATOR BIOLOGICS WITH 12 YEARS OF EXCLUSIVITY, WITH A POTENTIAL SIX-MONTH PEDIATRIC EXTENSION. AFTER THE EXCLUSIVITY PERIOD EXPIRES, THE FDA COULD APPROVE BIOSIMILAR VERSIONS OF INNOVATOR BIOLOGICS. THE REGULATORY IMPLEMENTATION OF THESE

PROVISIONS IS ONGOING AND EXPECTED TO TAKE SEVERAL YEARS. HOWEVER, THE FDA HAS BEGUN TO CLARIFY ITS EXPECTATIONS FOR APPROVAL VIA THE BIOSIMILAR PATHWAY WITH THE RECENT ISSUANCE OF THREE DRAFT GUIDANCE DOCUMENTS. AMONG OTHER THINGS, THESE DRAFT

GUIDANCE DOCUMENTS CONFIRM THAT THE FDA WILL ALLOW BIOSIMILAR APPLICANTS TO USE A NON-U.S. LICENSED COMPARATOR IN CERTAIN STUDIES TO SUPPORT A DEMONSTRATION OF BIOSIMILARITY TO A U.S.-LICENSED REFERENCE PRODUCT. IF COMPETITORS ARE ABLE TO OBTAIN

MARKETING APPROVAL FOR BIOSIMILARS REFERENCING OUR BIOTECHNOLOGY PRODUCTS, OUR BIOTECHNOLOGY PRODUCTS MAY BECOME SUBJECT TO COMPETITION FROM BIOSIMILARS, WITH THE ATTENDANT COMPETITIVE PRESSURES. CONCOMITANTLY, A BETTER-DEFINED BIOSIMILARS APPROVAL

PATHWAY WILL ASSIST US IN PURSUING APPROVAL OF OUR OWN BIOSIMILAR PRODUCTS IN THE U.S. SEE

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS  BIOTECHNOLOGY PRODUCTS

BELOW.

IN EUROPE, THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION HAS GRANTED MARKETING AUTHORIZATIONS FOR SEVERAL BIOSIMILARS PURSUANT TO A SET OF GENERAL AND PRODUCT CLASS-SPECIFIC GUIDELINES FOR BIOSIMILAR APPROVALS ISSUED OVER THE

PAST FEW YEARS, AND IN JAPAN, THE REGULATORY AUTHORITY HAS GRANTED MARKETING AUTHORIZATIONS FOR CERTAIN BIOSIMILARS, INCLUDING SOMATROPIN (THE RECOMBINANT HUMAN GROWTH HORMONE IN OUR

GENOTROPIN

PRODUCT) PURSUANT TO A GUIDELINE FOR BIOSIMILAR

APPROVALS ISSUED IN 2009. IF COMPETITORS ARE ABLE TO OBTAIN MARKETING APPROVAL FOR BIOSIMILARS REFERENCING OUR BIOTECHNOLOGY PRODUCTS, OUR BIOTECHNOLOGY PRODUCTS MAY BECOME SUBJECT TO COMPETITION FROM BIOSIMILARS, WITH THE ATTENDANT COMPETITIVE

PRESSURE, AND PRICE REDUCTIONS COULD FOLLOW. EXPIRATION OR SUCCESSFUL CHALLENGE OF APPLICABLE PATENT RIGHTS COULD GENERALLY TRIGGER THIS COMPETITION, ASSUMING ANY RELEVANT EXCLUSIVITY PERIOD HAS EXPIRED.

WE MAY FACE LITIGATION WITH RESPECT TO THE VALIDITY AND/OR SCOPE OF PATENTS RELATING TO OUR BIOTECHNOLOGY PRODUCTS WITH SUBSTANTIAL

REVENUE. LIKEWISE, AS WE ENTER THE BIOSIMILARS AREA AND SEEK TO LAUNCH PRODUCTS, PATENTS MAY BE ASSERTED AGAINST US.

ONE OF

THE MAIN LIMITATIONS ON OUR OPERATIONS IN SOME COUNTRIES OUTSIDE THE U.S. IS THE LACK OF EFFECTIVE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY PROTECTION FOR OUR PRODUCTS. UNDER INTERNATIONAL AND U.S. FREE TRADE AGREEMENTS IN RECENT YEARS, GLOBAL PROTECTION OF

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS HAS BEEN IMPROVING. THE WORLD TRADE ORGANIZATION AGREEMENT ON TRADE RELATED ASPECTS OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY (WTO-TRIPS) REQUIRED PARTICIPANT COUNTRIES TO AMEND THEIR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY LAWS TO PROVIDE PATENT

PROTECTION FOR PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS BY 2005 WITH AN EXTENSION UNTIL 2016 FOR LEAST-DEVELOPED NATIONS. A NUMBER OF COUNTRIES HAVE MADE IMPROVEMENTS. WE HAVE EXPERIENCED SIGNIFICANT GROWTH IN OUR BUSINESSES IN SOME OF THOSE NATIONS, AND OUR

CONTINUED BUSINESS EXPANSION IN OTHER PARTICIPANT COUNTRIES DEPENDS TO A LARGE DEGREE ON FURTHER PATENT PROTECTION IMPROVEMENT.

COMPETITION

OUR BUSINESSES ARE CONDUCTED IN INTENSELY COMPETITIVE AND OFTEN HIGHLY REGULATED MARKETS. MANY OF OUR

HUMAN PRESCRIPTION PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS FACE COMPETITION IN THE FORM OF BRANDED DRUGS OR GENERIC DRUGS THAT TREAT SIMILAR DISEASES OR INDICATIONS. THE PRINCIPAL FORMS OF COMPETITION INCLUDE EFFICACY, SAFETY, EASE OF USE, AND COST EFFECTIVENESS.

THOUGH THE MEANS OF COMPETITION VARY AMONG PRODUCT CATEGORIES AND BUSINESS GROUPS, DEMONSTRATING THE VALUE OF OUR PRODUCTS IS A CRITICAL FACTOR FOR SUCCESS IN ALL OF OUR PRINCIPAL BUSINESSES.

OUR ACQUISITION OF WYETH IN OCTOBER 2009 CREATED A BROADER, MORE DIVERSE PORTFOLIO AND PIPELINE WITH INDUSTRY-LEADING POSITIONS IN

POTENTIAL HIGH-GROWTH AREAS, FURTHER STRENGTHENED BY NEW CAPABILITIES IN BIOTECHNOLOGY AND VACCINES. THE ADDITION OF WYETH NOT ONLY STRENGTHENED OUR PRESENCE IN THE UNITED STATES AND EUROPE, BUT ALSO ENHANCES OUR ABILITIES TO PROVIDE EMERGING

MARKETS IN ASIA, LATIN AMERICA, AFRICA, THE MIDDLE EAST AND EASTERN EUROPE/RUSSIA WITH HIGH-QUALITY, INNOVATIVE MEDICINES.

15

OUR COMPETITORS INCLUDE OTHER WORLDWIDE RESEARCH-BASED DRUG COMPANIES, SMALLER RESEARCH

COMPANIES WITH MORE LIMITED THERAPEUTIC FOCUS, AND GENERIC DRUG AND CONSUMER HEALTHCARE MANUFACTURERS. WE COMPETE WITH OTHER COMPANIES THAT MANUFACTURE AND SELL PRODUCTS THAT TREAT SIMILAR DISEASES OR INDICATIONS AS OUR MAJOR PRODUCTS.

SUCH COMPETITION AFFECTS OUR CORE PRODUCT BUSINESS, WHICH IS FOCUSED ON APPLYING INNOVATIVE SCIENCE TO DISCOVER AND MARKET PRODUCTS THAT

SATISFY UNMET MEDICAL NEEDS AND PROVIDE THERAPEUTIC IMPROVEMENTS. OUR EMPHASIS ON INNOVATION IS UNDERSCORED BY OUR MULTI-BILLION-DOLLAR INVESTMENT IN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, AS WELL AS OUR BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT TRANSACTIONS OVER THE PAST DECADE,

RESULTING IN A STRONG PRODUCT PIPELINE. OUR INVESTMENT IN RESEARCH DOES NOT STOP WITH DRUG APPROVAL; WE CONTINUE TO INVEST IN FURTHER UNDERSTANDING THE VALUE OF OUR PRODUCTS FOR THE CONDITIONS THEY TREAT, AS WELL AS POTENTIAL NEW APPLICATIONS. WE

SEEK TO PROTECT THE HEALTH AND WELL-BEING OF PATIENTS BY STRIVING TO ENSURE THAT MEDICALLY SOUND KNOWLEDGE OF THE BENEFITS AND RISKS OF OUR MEDICINES IS UNDERSTOOD AND COMMUNICATED TO PATIENTS, PHYSICIANS AND GLOBAL HEALTH AUTHORITIES. WE ALSO

CONTINUE TO ENHANCE THE ORGANIZATIONAL EFFECTIVENESS OF ALL OF OUR BIOPHARMACEUTICAL FUNCTIONS, INCLUDING COORDINATING SUPPORT FOR OUR SALESPERSONS EFFORTS TO ACCURATELY AND ETHICALLY LAUNCH AND PROMOTE OUR PRODUCTS TO OUR CUSTOMERS.

OPERATING CONDITIONS HAVE BECOME MORE CHALLENGING UNDER THE MOUNTING GLOBAL PRESSURES OF COMPETITION, INDUSTRY REGULATION AND

COST CONTAINMENT. WE CONTINUE TO TAKE MEASURES TO EVALUATE, ADAPT AND IMPROVE OUR ORGANIZATION AND BUSINESS PRACTICES TO BETTER MEET CUSTOMER AND PUBLIC NEEDS. FOR INSTANCE, OUR U.S. PRIMARY CARE OPERATIONS ARE STRUCTURED INTO REGIONAL UNITS IN

ORDER TO CREATE A MORE FLEXIBLE ORGANIZATION EMPOWERED TO IDENTIFY AND ADDRESS LOCAL MARKET DYNAMICS AND CUSTOMER NEEDS. WE HAVE TAKEN AN INDUSTRY-LEADING ROLE IN EVOLVING OUR APPROACHES TO U.S. DIRECT-TO-CONSUMER ADVERTISING, INTERACTIONS WITH, AND

PAYMENTS TO, HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONALS AND MEDICAL EDUCATION GRANTS. WE ALSO CONTINUE TO SPONSOR PROGRAMS TO ADDRESS PATIENT AFFORDABILITY AND ACCESS BARRIERS, AS WE STRIVE TO ADVANCE FUNDAMENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM CHANGE THROUGH SUPPORT FOR BETTER

HEALTHCARE SOLUTIONS.

WHILE OUR ANIMAL HEALTH BUSINESS UNIT IS THE LEADING ANIMAL HEALTH COMPANY WITH MARKET POSITIONS

THROUGHOUT THE WORLD, MANY OTHER COMPANIES OFFER COMPETING PRODUCTS. ALTOGETHER, THERE ARE HUNDREDS OF PRODUCERS OF ANIMAL HEALTH PRODUCTS THROUGHOUT THE WORLD. THE PRINCIPAL METHODS OF COMPETITION VARY SOMEWHAT DEPENDING ON THE PARTICULAR PRODUCT.

THEY INCLUDE PRODUCT INNOVATION, QUALITY, PRICE, SERVICE AND EFFECTIVE PROMOTION TO VETERINARY PROFESSIONALS AND LIVESTOCK PRODUCERS.

OUR CONSUMER HEALTHCARE BUSINESS UNIT FACES COMPETITION FROM OVER-THE-COUNTER BUSINESS UNITS IN OTHER MAJOR PHARMACEUTICAL AND CONSUMER PACKAGED GOODS COMPANIES, AS WELL AS RETAILERS WHO CARRY THEIR OWN

PRIVATE LABEL BRANDS. OUR COMPETITIVE POSITION IS AFFECTED BY SEVERAL FACTORS, INCLUDING THE AMOUNT AND EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR AND OUR COMPETITORS PROMOTIONAL RESOURCES; CUSTOMER ACCEPTANCE; PRODUCT QUALITY; OUR AND OUR COMPETITORS

INTRODUCTION OF NEW PRODUCTS, INGREDIENTS, CLAIMS, DOSAGE FORMS, OR OTHER FORMS OF INNOVATION; AND PRICING, REGULATORY AND LEGISLATIVE MATTERS (E.G., PRODUCT LABELING, PATIENT ACCESS, PRESCRIPTION TO OVER-THE-COUNTER SWITCHES, ETC.).

OUR NUTRITION BUSINESS UNIT COMPETES WITH MULTINATIONAL COMPANIES IN THE PHARMACEUTICAL AND FOOD INDUSTRIES, AS WELL AS NUMEROUS SMALLER

LOCAL AND REGIONAL COMPANIES MANUFACTURING INFANT NUTRITION PRODUCTS. OUR COMPETITIVE POSITION IS AFFECTED BY SEVERAL FACTORS, PARTICULARLY THE AMOUNT OF RESOURCES DEPLOYED TO DEVELOP, ENHANCE AND PROMOTE PRODUCTS; THE RAPID PACE OF PRODUCT AND

PACKAGING INNOVATION IN THE CATEGORY, INCLUDING SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES; OVERALL PRODUCT QUALITY; THE EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR PROMOTIONAL EFFORTS; AND PRODUCT LAUNCH CAMPAIGNS. ALL OF THESE FACTORS DRIVE BRAND RECOMMENDATIONS FROM

HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONALS AND OVERALL CUSTOMER PREFERENCE FOR OUR PRODUCT BRANDS.

MANAGED CARE ORGANIZATIONS

THE GROWTH OF MCOS IN THE U.S. HAS BEEN A MAJOR FACTOR IN THE COMPETITIVE MAKEUP OF THE HEALTHCARE MARKETPLACE. APPROXIMATELY

250 MILLION PEOPLE IN THE U.S. NOW PARTICIPATE IN SOME FORM OF MANAGED CARE.

16

BECAUSE OF THE SIZE OF THE PATIENT POPULATION COVERED BY MCOS, THE MARKETING OF PRESCRIPTION DRUGS TO THEM AND THE PBMS THAT SERVE MANY OF THOSE ORGANIZATIONS CONTINUES TO GROW IN IMPORTANCE.

MCOS CAN INCLUDE MEDICAL INSURANCE COMPANIES, MEDICAL PLAN ADMINISTRATORS, HEALTH MAINTENANCE ORGANIZATIONS, ALLIANCES OF

HOSPITALS AND PHYSICIANS AND OTHER PHYSICIAN ORGANIZATIONS. THE PURCHASING POWER OF MCOS HAS INCREASED IN RECENT YEARS DUE TO THE GROWING NUMBERS OF PATIENTS ENROLLED IN MCOS. AT THE SAME TIME, THOSE ORGANIZATIONS HAVE BEEN CONSOLIDATING INTO FEWER,

EVEN LARGER ENTITIES. THIS CONSOLIDATION ENHANCES BOTH THEIR PURCHASING STRENGTH AND IMPORTANCE TO US.

THE GROWTH OF MCOS HAS

INCREASED PRESSURE ON DRUG PRICES. ONE OBJECTIVE OF MCOS IS TO CONTAIN AND, WHERE POSSIBLE, REDUCE HEALTHCARE EXPENDITURES. MCOS TYPICALLY USE FORMULARIES, VOLUME PURCHASES AND LONG-TERM CONTRACTS TO NEGOTIATE DISCOUNTS FROM PHARMACEUTICAL

PROVIDERS. ALSO, MCOS USE THEIR PURCHASING POWER AND THEIR ABILITY TO INFLUENCE MARKET SHARE AND VOLUME OF PRESCRIPTION DRUGS TO BARGAIN FOR LOWER SUPPLIER PRICES. THEY ALSO EMPHASIZE PRIMARY AND PREVENTIVE CARE, OUT-PATIENT TREATMENT AND PROCEDURES

PERFORMED AT DOCTORS OFFICES AND CLINICS. HOSPITALIZATION AND SURGERY, TYPICALLY THE MOST EXPENSIVE FORMS OF TREATMENT, ARE CAREFULLY MANAGED. SINCE THE USE OF CERTAIN DRUGS CAN REDUCE THE NEED FOR HOSPITALIZATION, PROFESSIONAL THERAPY, OR

EVEN SURGERY, SUCH DRUGS CAN BECOME FAVORED FIRST-LINE TREATMENTS FOR CERTAIN DISEASES.

AS DISCUSSED ABOVE IN

MARKETING

, MCOS AND PBMS TYPICALLY DEVELOP FORMULARIES, WHICH ARE SELECTIONS OF MEDICINES AVAILABLE TO MEMBERS THAT ARE TIERED ACCORDING TO CO-PAY AMOUNTS. FORMULARIES ARE TYPICALLY BASED ON THE PRICES AND THERAPEUTIC BENEFITS, OR A

COMBINATION OF THE TWO, OF THE AVAILABLE PRODUCTS. DUE TO THEIR GENERALLY LOWER COST, GENERIC MEDICINES TYPICALLY ARE PLACED IN LOWEST COST TIERS. THE BREADTH OF THE PRODUCTS COVERED BY FORMULARIES CAN VARY CONSIDERABLY FROM ONE MCO TO ANOTHER AND

MANY FORMULARIES INCLUDE ALTERNATIVE AND COMPETITIVE PRODUCTS FOR TREATMENT OF PARTICULAR MEDICAL PROBLEMS. MCOS USE A VARIETY OF MEANS TO ENCOURAGE PATIENTS USE OF PRODUCTS LISTED ON THEIR FORMULARIES.

EXCLUSION OF A PRODUCT FROM A FORMULARY OR OTHER MCO-IMPLEMENTED RESTRICTION CAN SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT DRUG USAGE IN THE MCO PATIENT

POPULATION. CONSEQUENTLY, PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES COMPETE AGGRESSIVELY TO GAIN ACCESS TO FORMULARIES FOR THEIR PRODUCTS. UNIQUE PRODUCT FEATURES, SUCH AS GREATER EFFICACY, BETTER PATIENT EASE OF USE, OR FEWER SIDE EFFECTS, ARE GENERALLY BENEFICIAL

TO ACHIEVING ACCESS TO FORMULARIES. HOWEVER, LOWER OVERALL COST OF THERAPY IS ALSO AN IMPORTANT FACTOR. WE HAVE BEEN GENERALLY, ALTHOUGH NOT UNIVERSALLY, SUCCESSFUL IN HAVING OUR MAJOR PRODUCTS INCLUDED ON MOST MCO FORMULARIES.

THE IMPACT OF MCOS ON DRUG PRICES AND VOLUMES HAS INCREASED AS A RESULT OF THEIR ROLE IN NEGOTIATING ON BEHALF OF MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES

IN CONNECTION WITH THE MEDICARE OUTPATIENT PRESCRIPTION DRUG BENEFIT, MEDICARE PART D, WHICH TOOK EFFECT JANUARY 1, 2006. MCOS AND PBMS NEGOTIATE ON BEHALF OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AS PRESCRIPTION DRUG PLANS (PDPS). WE HAVE BEEN GENERALLY,

ALTHOUGH NOT UNIVERSALLY, SUCCESSFUL IN HAVING OUR MAJOR PRODUCTS THAT ARE USED BY THE SENIOR POPULATION INCLUDED ON THE FORMULARIES OF THE MEDICARE PDPS IN 2011.

GENERIC PRODUCTS

ONE OF THE BIGGEST COMPETITIVE CHALLENGES THAT WE FACE

IS FROM GENERIC PHARMACEUTICAL MANUFACTURERS. UPON THE EXPIRATION OR LOSS OF PATENT PROTECTION FOR A PRODUCT, ESPECIALLY A SMALL MOLECULE PRODUCT, WE CAN LOSE THE MAJOR PORTION OF SALES OF THAT PRODUCT IN A VERY SHORT PERIOD. SEVERAL SUCH

COMPETITORS MAKE A REGULAR PRACTICE OF CHALLENGING OUR PRODUCT PATENTS BEFORE THEIR EXPIRATION. GENERIC COMPETITORS OPERATE WITHOUT LARGE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES, AS WELL AS WITHOUT COSTS OF CONVEYING MEDICAL INFORMATION ABOUT PRODUCTS TO

THE MEDICAL COMMUNITY, ALL OF WHICH WE ARE REQUIRED TO DO. IN ADDITION, THE FDA APPROVAL PROCESS EXEMPTS GENERICS FROM COSTLY AND TIME-CONSUMING CLINICAL TRIALS TO DEMONSTRATE THEIR SAFETY AND EFFICACY, ALLOWING GENERIC MANUFACTURERS TO RELY ON THE

SAFETY AND EFFICACY DATA OF THE INNOVATOR PRODUCT. GENERIC PRODUCTS NEED ONLY DEMONSTRATE A LEVEL OF AVAILABILITY IN THE BODY EQUIVALENT TO THAT OF THE INNOVATOR PRODUCT. THIS MEANS THAT GENERIC COMPETITORS CAN MARKET A COMPETING VERSION OF OUR

PRODUCT AFTER THE EXPIRATION OR LOSS OF OUR PATENT AND OFTEN CHARGE MUCH LESS.

17

IN ADDITION, OUR PATENT-PROTECTED PRODUCTS CAN FACE COMPETITION IN THE FORM OF GENERIC

VERSIONS OF COMPETITORS BRANDED PRODUCTS THAT LOSE THEIR MARKET EXCLUSIVITY.

AS NOTED ABOVE, MCOS THAT FOCUS PRIMARILY

ON THE IMMEDIATE COST OF DRUGS OFTEN FAVOR GENERICS OVER BRAND-NAME DRUGS. MANY GOVERNMENTS ALSO ENCOURAGE THE USE OF GENERICS AS ALTERNATIVES TO BRAND-NAME DRUGS IN THEIR HEALTHCARE PROGRAMS, INCLUDING MEDICAID IN THE U.S. LAWS IN THE U.S.

GENERALLY ALLOW, AND IN SOME CASES REQUIRE, PHARMACISTS TO SUBSTITUTE GENERIC DRUGS THAT HAVE BEEN RATED UNDER GOVERNMENT PROCEDURES TO BE THERAPEUTICALLY EQUIVALENT TO BRAND-NAME DRUGS. THE SUBSTITUTION MUST BE MADE UNLESS THE PRESCRIBING PHYSICIAN

EXPRESSLY FORBIDS IT. IN THE U.S., PFIZERS GREENSTONE SUBSIDIARY AND PFIZER INJECTABLES SELL GENERIC VERSIONS OF PFIZERS, AS WELL AS CERTAIN COMPETITORS, SOLID ORAL DOSE AND STERILE INJECTABLE PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS, RESPECTIVELY,

UPON LOSS OF EXCLUSIVITY, AS APPROPRIATE.

RAW MATERIALS

RAW MATERIALS ESSENTIAL TO OUR BUSINESSES ARE PURCHASED WORLDWIDE IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS FROM NUMEROUS SUPPLIERS. IN GENERAL,

THESE MATERIALS ARE AVAILABLE FROM MULTIPLE SOURCES. NO SERIOUS SHORTAGES OR DELAYS WERE ENCOUNTERED IN 2011, AND NONE ARE EXPECTED IN 2012. HOWEVER, SELECT MATERIALS HAVE, FROM TIME TO TIME, INCREASED IN PRICE DUE TO SHORT-TERM IMBALANCES BETWEEN

SUPPLY AND DEMAND. WE HAVE SUCCESSFULLY SECURED THE MATERIALS NECESSARY TO MEET OUR REQUIREMENTS IN THESE CIRCUMSTANCES BUT GENERALLY AT HIGHER PRICES THAN THOSE HISTORICALLY PAID.

GOVERNMENT REGULATION AND PRICE CONSTRAINTS

IN THE UNITED

STATES

GENERAL.

PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES ARE SUBJECT TO EXTENSIVE REGULATION BY NATIONAL, STATE AND LOCAL AGENCIES

IN THE COUNTRIES IN WHICH THEY DO BUSINESS. OF PARTICULAR IMPORTANCE IN THE U.S. IS THE FDA. IT HAS JURISDICTION OVER OUR BIOPHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS AND ADMINISTERS REQUIREMENTS COVERING THE TESTING, SAFETY, EFFECTIVENESS, MANUFACTURING, LABELING,

MARKETING, ADVERTISING AND POST-MARKETING SURVEILLANCE OF THESE PRODUCTS. THE FDA ALSO REGULATES OUR CONSUMER HEALTHCARE AND ANIMAL HEALTH PRODUCTS. THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE AND THE U.S. ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY ALSO REGULATE SOME

OF OUR PRODUCTS.

IN ADDITION, MANY OF OUR ACTIVITIES ARE SUBJECT TO THE JURISDICTION OF VARIOUS OTHER FEDERAL REGULATORY AND

ENFORCEMENT DEPARTMENTS AND AGENCIES, SUCH AS THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES (HHS), THE FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION (FTC) (WHICH ALSO HAS THE AUTHORITY TO REGULATE THE ADVERTISING OF CONSUMER HEALTHCARE PRODUCTS, INCLUDING OVER-THE-COUNTER

DRUGS AND DIETARY SUPPLEMENTS), THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE (DOJ) AND THE SEC. INDIVIDUAL STATES, ACTING THROUGH THEIR ATTORNEYS GENERAL, HAVE BECOME ACTIVE AS WELL, SEEKING TO REGULATE THE MARKETING OF PRESCRIPTION DRUGS UNDER STATE CONSUMER

PROTECTION AND FALSE ADVERTISING LAWS.

WE ARE SUBJECT TO POSSIBLE ADMINISTRATIVE AND LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND ACTIONS BY THESE

VARIOUS REGULATORY BODIES. SEE THE NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

 NOTE 17. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

IN OUR 2011 FINANCIAL REPORT. SUCH ACTIONS MAY INVOLVE PRODUCT RECALLS, SEIZURES AND OTHER CIVIL

AND CRIMINAL SANCTIONS.

HEALTHCARE REFORM.

IN MARCH 2010, THE ACA WAS ENACTED IN THE U.S. THE PROVISIONS OF THE ACA

ARE EFFECTIVE ON VARIOUS DATES. THE PRINCIPAL PROVISIONS AFFECTING THE BIOPHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY INCLUDE.



AN INCREASE, FROM 15.1% TO 23.1%, IN THE MINIMUM REBATE ON BRANDED PRESCRIPTION DRUGS SOLD TO MEDICAID BENEFICIARIES (EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2010);



EXTENSION OF MEDICAID PRESCRIPTION DRUG REBATES TO DRUGS DISPENSED TO ENROLLEES IN CERTAIN MEDICAID MANAGED CARE ORGANIZATIONS (EFFECTIVE MARCH 23,

2010);



EXPANSION OF THE TYPES OF INSTITUTIONS ELIGIBLE FOR THE SECTION 340B DISCOUNTS FOR OUTPATIENT DRUGS PROVIDED TO HOSPITALS MEETING THE

QUALIFICATION CRITERIA UNDER SECTION 340B OF THE PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICE ACT OF 1944 (EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2010);



DISCOUNTS ON BRANDED PRESCRIPTION DRUG SALES TO MEDICARE PART D PARTICIPANTS WHO ARE IN THE MEDICARE COVERAGE GAP, ALSO KNOWN AS THE

DOUGHNUT HOLE (EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2011); AND

18



A FEE PAYABLE TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT (WHICH IS NOT DEDUCTIBLE FOR U.S. INCOME TAX PURPOSES) BASED ON OUR PRIOR-CALENDAR-YEAR SHARE RELATIVE TO OTHER

COMPANIES OF BRANDED PRESCRIPTION DRUG SALES TO SPECIFIED GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS (EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2011, WITH THE TOTAL FEE TO BE PAID EACH YEAR BY THE PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY INCREASING ANNUALLY THROUGH 2018).

THE ACA IS ESTIMATED TO RESULT IN THE COVERAGE OF 32 MILLION PREVIOUSLY UNINSURED INDIVIDUALS. APPROXIMATELY HALF OF THIS WILL OCCUR

THROUGH AN EXPANSION OF THE MEDICAID PROGRAM. EFFECTIVE IN 2014, INDIVIDUALS WITH INCOMES BELOW 133% OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL (FPL) WILL BE ELIGIBLE FOR MEDICAID. THE REMAINDER WILL BE COVERED WITH PRIVATE SECTOR COVERAGE EITHER THROUGH THEIR

EMPLOYERS OR NEW STATE-BASED HEALTH INSURANCE EXCHANGES. WITH LIMITED EXCEPTIONS, INDIVIDUALS WHO FAIL TO PURCHASE HEALTH INSURANCE WILL PAY A PENALTY. INDIVIDUALS WITH INCOMES BETWEEN 100%-400% OF THE FPL WILL BE ELIGIBLE FOR SUBSIDIES TO HELP PAY

FOR COVERAGE.

EXPANDING INSURANCE COVERAGE AND OTHER COSTS ARE EXPECTED TO REPRESENT A RELATIVELY MODEST GAIN TO OVERALL

PHARMACEUTICAL SALES AS THE NEWLY INSURED ARE PRINCIPALLY YOUNG AND RELATIVELY HEALTHY. AT THE SAME TIME, THE REBATES, DISCOUNTS, TAXES AND OTHER COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE ACA ARE A SIGNIFICANT COST TO THE INDUSTRY.

THE ACA CREATED THE INDEPENDENT PAYMENT ADVISORY BOARD (IPAB), A 15-MEMBER PANEL APPOINTED BY THE PRESIDENT WITH THE ADVICE AND CONSENT

OF THE SENATE. THE IPAB IS CHARGED WITH DEVELOPING PROPOSALS TO REDUCE THE PER CAPITA RATE OF GROWTH IN MEDICARE SPENDING IN THE EVENT THAT THE ACTUAL MEDICARE PER CAPITA GROWTH RATE EXCEEDS A SPECIFIED TARGET. UNLESS CONGRESS ACTS TO

ALTER THE PROPOSALS, THE PROPOSALS WILL BE AUTOMATICALLY IMPLEMENTED. HOWEVER, THE IPAB CANNOT DIRECTLY RATION CARE, RAISE PREMIUMS, INCREASE COST SHARING, OR OTHERWISE RESTRICT BENEFITS OR MODIFY ELIGIBILITY. IF THE IPAB FAILS TO ACT, THE SECRETARY

OF HHS IS DIRECTED TO PREPARE SUCH PROPOSALS. THE IPAB IS PROHIBITED BY STATUTE FROM MAKING PAYMENT REDUCTIONS TO CERTAIN SECTORS SUCH AS HOSPITALS AND HOME HEALTH AGENCIES, WHICH INCREASES THE RISK THAT THE IPAB WILL PROPOSE TO LIMIT ACCESS TO

PHARMACEUTICAL TREATMENTS OR MANDATE PRICE CONTROLS FOR OUR PRODUCTS.

THE ACA ALSO ESTABLISHED THE PATIENT CENTERED OUTCOMES

RESEARCH INSTITUTE (PCORI), A FEDERALLY-FUNDED, PRIVATE, NON-PROFIT CORPORATION EMPOWERED TO FUND AND DISSEMINATE COMPARATIVE EFFECTIVENESS RESEARCH (CER) AND BUILD INFRASTRUCTURE FOR IMPROVED OUTCOMES ANALYSIS. PCORI HAS NO AUTHORITY TO IMPOSE

FORMULARY CHANGES DIRECTLY IN GOVERNMENT-FUNDED HEALTH PROGRAMS. WE EXPECT THAT DUE TO THE PCORI, AS WELL AS THE UNDERLYING MARKET DEMAND FOR DATA-DRIVEN DIFFERENTIATION, CER STUDIES WILL HAVE GROWING INFLUENCE ON ACCESS. OVERSEEING AND MANAGING THE

PCORI IS AN ADVISORY BOARD DRAWN FROM MULTIPLE AND VARIED STAKEHOLDER ORGANIZATIONS, INCLUDING THE PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY. PFIZERS CHIEF MEDICAL OFFICER CURRENTLY SERVES AS THE INDUSTRY REPRESENTATIVE ON THE ADVISORY BOARD.

THE ACA SPECIFIES CERTAIN BENEFITS AND SERVICES THAT MUST BE COVERED FOR HEALTH INSURERS TO QUALIFY TO PARTICIPATE IN THE STATE INSURANCE

EXCHANGES. PRESCRIPTION DRUGS ARE AMONG THESE ESSENTIAL BENEFITS IN THE LAW. REGULATORS ARE EXPECTED TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE TO STATES ON THE TYPES OF BENEFITS AND SERVICES THAT MUST BE COVERED.

IN 2012, THE U.S. SUPREME COURT IS TO REVIEW CERTAIN PROVISIONS OF THE ACA, INCLUDING: (1) THE CONSTITUTIONALITY OF THE ACAS

INDIVIDUAL MANDATE THAT REQUIRES MOST AMERICANS TO BUY HEALTH INSURANCE STARTING IN 2014; (2) THE SEVERABILITY OF THE INDIVIDUAL MANDATE FROM THE OTHER PROVISIONS OF THE ACA, IF THE INDIVIDUAL MANDATE IS STRUCK DOWN; (3) THE

ACAS MEDICAID EXPANSION, WHICH WOULD REQUIRE EACH STATE TO EXPAND ITS PROGRAM OR LOSE ALL FEDERAL MEDICAID FUNDS; AND (4) THE APPLICABILITY OF A FEDERAL TAX LAW, THE ANTI-INJUNCTION ACT, TO THE LAWSUITS BROUGHT ON THE INDIVIDUAL MANDATE,

WHICH COULD BAR REVIEW OF THAT ACA PROVISION UNTIL AT LEAST 2014. THE COURT IS SCHEDULED TO HEAR ORAL ARGUMENTS IN LATE MARCH AND A DECISION IS LIKELY IN JUNE.

CHANGES IN MARKETING ACTIVITY DISCLOSURE

. THE ACA EXPANDS THE GOVERNMENTS INVESTIGATIVE AND ENFORCEMENT AUTHORITY AND INCREASES THE PENALTIES FOR FRAUD AND ABUSE, INCLUDING AMENDMENTS TO BOTH

THE FALSE CLAIMS ACT AND THE ANTI-KICKBACK STATUTE TO MAKE IT EASIER TO BRING SUIT UNDER THESE STATUTES. THE ACA ALSO ALLOCATES ADDITIONAL RESOURCES AND TOOLS FOR THE GOVERNMENT TO POLICE HEALTHCARE FRAUD, WITH EXPANDED SUBPOENA POWER FOR HHS,

ADDITIONAL FUNDING TO INVESTIGATE FRAUD AND ABUSE, AND EXPANDED USE OF RECOVERY AUDIT CONTRACTORS FOR ENFORCEMENT.

19

STARTING IN 2012, PHARMACEUTICAL MANUFACTURERS WILL BE REQUIRED TO RECORD ANY TRANSFERS OF

VALUE MADE TO DOCTORS AND TEACHING HOSPITALS AND TO DISCLOSE SUCH DATA TO HHS, WITH THE INITIAL DISCLOSURE TO HHS DUE IN 2013. IN ADDITION TO CIVIL PENALTIES FOR FAILURE TO REPORT TRANSFERS OF VALUE TO PHYSICIANS OR TEACHING HOSPITALS, THERE WILL BE

CRIMINAL PENALTIES IF A MANUFACTURER INTENTIONALLY MAKES FALSE STATEMENTS IN SUCH REPORTS. FURTHER, THE INCREASED ACCESS TO SUCH DATA BY FRAUD AND ABUSE INVESTIGATORS COULD POTENTIALLY RAISE THE RISK OF LIABILITY FOR IMPROPER PAYMENTS UNDER THE

FALSE CLAIMS ACT. PFIZER ALREADY RECORDS AND MAKES PUBLIC THESE TYPES OF TRANSFERS AND EXPECTS TO BE PREPARED TO REPORT THE INFORMATION IN THE FORMAT REQUESTED BY HHS. THIS NATIONAL PAYMENT TRANSPARENCY EFFORT AND INDUSTRY COMMITMENT TO UPHOLD

VOLUNTARY CODES OF CONDUCT (THE UPDATED PHRMA

CODE ON INTERACTIONS WITH HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONALS

, PHRMA

GUIDING PRINCIPLES DIRECT TO CONSUMER ADVERTISEMENTS ABOUT PRESCRIPTION MEDICINES,

ETC.) WILL COMPLEMENT EXISTING LAWS AND

REGULATIONS TO HELP ENSURE ETHICAL COLLABORATION AND TRUTHFUL PRODUCT COMMUNICATIONS. THESE EFFORTS ARE IN PLACE TO HELP ENSURE RESPONSIBLE MARKETING APPROACHES AND TO ADDRESS CONCERNS.

MEDICARE.

MEDICARE PART D WENT INTO EFFECT ON JANUARY 1, 2006. ELDERLY AND DISABLED BENEFICIARIES HAVE ACCESS TO THE MEDICARE

DRUG BENEFIT THROUGH PRIVATE PLANS APPROVED BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. BENEFICIARIES WITH LOW INCOMES AND MODEST ASSETS ARE ELIGIBLE FOR ASSISTANCE WITH MEDICARE PART D PLAN PREMIUMS AND COST SHARING. NATIONALLY, THE SHARE OF SUCH BENEFICIARIES WITH

COMPREHENSIVE DRUG COVERAGE INCREASED FROM 59% IN 2005 TO OVER 90% IN 2010. MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES REPORT HIGH LEVELS OF SATISFACTION, WITH AN OVERWHELMING MAJORITY SAYING THE PROGRAM WORKS WELL. IN ADDITION, THE PROGRAM COSTS LESS THAN ORIGINALLY

EXPECTED.

THE ACA MADE SOME IMPORTANT CHANGES TO THE DRUG BENEFITIN PARTICULAR, PHASING OUT THE COVERAGE GAP BY 2020.

PRIOR TO THE ACA, BENEFICIARIES WHO REACHED A CERTAIN LEVEL OF SPENDING ON PRESCRIPTION MEDICATIONS (THE MEDICARE PART D COVERAGE GAP OR DOUGHNUT HOLE) HAD TO PAY 100% OF THE COST OF THEIR DRUGS UNTIL PERSONAL OUT-OF-POCKET SPENDING

REACHED A LEVEL QUALIFYING THEM FOR CATASTROPHIC COVERAGE. THE MEDICARE PART D COVERAGE GAP DISCOUNT PROGRAM USES PUBLIC AND PRIVATE FUNDING TO RELIEVE THE FINANCIAL BURDEN FACING BENEFICIARIES WHO FALL INTO THIS COVERAGE GAP. BEGINNING IN 2011,

BRANDED PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES PAID 50% OF THE COST OF THE BRANDED DRUGS IN THE GAP AND THE GOVERNMENT PAID 7% OF THE COST OF THE GENERIC DRUGS IN THE GAP. AS A RESULT, RATHER THAN PAYING 100% OF THE TOTAL COST OF THEIR DRUGS WHEN THEY REACH THE

COVERAGE GAP, ENROLLEES PAID 50% OF THE TOTAL COST OF BRANDED DRUGS AND 93% OF THE TOTAL COST OF GENERIC DRUGS. IN 2012, THE BRANDED DISCOUNT WILL REMAIN 50%, BUT THE GENERIC DISCOUNT WILL INCREASE TO 14%. BY 2020, ENROLLEES WILL PAY ONLY 25% OF THE

COST OF THEIR BRANDED AND GENERIC DRUGS IN THE GAP AS THE SHARE COVERED BY THE GOVERNMENT WILL INCREASE.

BIOSIMILARS.

THE ACA ALSO CREATED A FRAMEWORK FOR THE APPROVAL OF FOLLOW-ON BIOLOGICS, OR BIOSIMILARS, FOLLOWING THE EXPIRATION OF 12 YEARS OF EXCLUSIVITY FOR THE INNOVATOR BIOLOGIC, WITH A POTENTIAL SIX-MONTH PEDIATRIC EXTENSION. THE FDA IS RESPONSIBLE FOR

IMPLEMENTATION OF THE LEGISLATION, WHICH WILL REQUIRE THE FDA TO ADDRESS SUCH KEY TOPICS AS THE TYPE AND EXTENT OF DATA NEEDED TO ESTABLISH BIOSIMILARITY; THE DATA REQUIRED TO ACHIEVE INTERCHANGEABILITY COMPARED TO BIOSIMILARITY; THE NAMING OF

BIOSIMILARS; THE IMPLICATIONS OF HAVING OR NOT HAVING UNIQUE NAMES; THE TRACKING AND TRACING OF ADVERSE EVENTS; AND THE ACCEPTABILITY OF DATA FROM AN EX-U.S. LICENSED REFERENCE PRODUCT COMPARATOR TO DEMONSTRATE BIOSIMILARITY AND/OR

INTERCHANGEABILITY. THE FDA HAS BEGUN TO ADDRESS SOME OF THESE ISSUES WITH ITS RECENT RELEASE OF THREE DRAFT GUIDANCE DOCUMENTS. SPECIFICALLY, THE FDA HAS CLARIFIED THAT BIOSIMILAR APPLICANTS MAY USE A NON-U.S. LICENSED COMPARATOR IN CERTAIN STUDIES

TO SUPPORT A DEMONSTRATION OF BIOSIMILARITY TO A U.S.-LICENSED REFERENCE PRODUCT.

PFIZER IS DEVELOPING BIOSIMILAR MEDICINES.

LEVERAGING OUR EXPERTISE IN BIOLOGICS, AND OUR REGULATORY, COMMERCIAL, AND MANUFACTURING STRENGTHS, WE WILL SEEK TO PROVIDE HIGH-QUALITY, SAFE AND EFFECTIVE BIOSIMILARS THAT PROVIDE PATIENTS AND PRESCRIBERS WITH ADDITIONAL TREATMENT OPTIONS AND

EXPAND ACCESS BY OFFERING HIGH-QUALITY, MORE AFFORDABLE ALTERNATIVES FOR BIOLOGIC MEDICINES.

THE BUDGET PROPOSAL SUBMITTED TO

CONGRESS BY PRESIDENT OBAMA IN FEBRUARY 2012 INCLUDES A PROVISION THAT WOULD REDUCE THE BASE EXCLUSIVITY PERIOD FOR A BIOLOGICS PRODUCT FROM 12 YEARS TO SEVEN YEARS. THERE IS NO CORRESPONDING PENDING BILL DESIGNED TO AMEND THE ACA TO ALTER THE

BIOLOGICS PROVISIONS.

20

MEDICAID AND RELATED MATTERS.

FEDERAL LAW REQUIRES BRANDED PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES

TO PROVIDE REBATES TO STATE MEDICAID AGENCIES. THE ACA BROUGHT ABOUT MAJOR CHANGES IN THE MEDICAID PROGRAM. COLLECTIVELY, THE MEASURES (I) INCREASED FEDERAL REBATES PAID BY MANUFACTURERS ON BRANDED DRUGS WITHIN THE TRADITIONAL MEDICAID PROGRAM

FROM 15.1% TO 23.1%, AND FOR GENERIC DRUGS FROM 11% TO 13% OF AVERAGE MANUFACTURER PRICE (AMP); (II) EXPANDED MEDICAID DRUG REBATES TO COVER DRUGS PROVIDED THROUGH MANAGED MEDICAID PLANS; AND (III) CHANGED THE REBATE RATES FOR LINE

EXTENSIONS OR NEW FORMULATIONS OF SOLID ORAL DOSAGE FORM DRUGS. POST-IMPLEMENTATION OF ACA, THE CENTERS FOR MEDICARE AND MEDICAID SERVICES (CMS) WITHDREW ITS FORMER, DETAILED AMP-CALCULATION RULES, AND NEW CMS AMP GUIDANCE IS STILL PENDING

PUBLICATION (NOW EXPECTED IN 2012). THE LAW ALSO CREATES A FEDERAL UPPER LIMIT UNDER THE MEDICAID PROGRAM FOR GENERIC DRUGS AT 175% OF AMP. IN ADDITION, THE LAW EXPANDED THE TYPES OF ENTITIES ELIGIBLE FOR THE SECTION 340B DISCOUNTS FOR

OUTPATIENT DRUGS THAT BEGAN IN 2010.

THE MAJORITY OF STATES USE PREFERRED DRUG LISTS TO RESTRICT ACCESS TO CERTAIN MEDICINES

TO MEDICAID BENEFICIARIES. RESTRICTIONS EXIST FOR SOME PFIZER PRODUCTS IN CERTAIN STATES. ACCESS IN THE MEDICAID MANAGED CARE PROGRAM IS TYPICALLY DETERMINED BY THE HEALTH PLANS PROVIDING COVERAGE FOR MEDICAID RECIPIENTS CONTRACTING FOR THE

PROVISION OF SERVICES IN THE STATE. GIVEN STATES CURRENT AND POTENTIAL ONGOING FISCAL CRISES, A GROWING NUMBER OF STATES ARE CONSIDERING A VARIETY OF COST-CONTROL STRATEGIES, INCLUDING CAPITATED MANAGED CARE PLANS THAT TYPICALLY CONTAIN COST

BY RESTRICTING ACCESS TO CERTAIN TREATMENTS.

THE ACA EXPANDS MEDICAID COVERAGE IN 2014. IT IS EXPECTED THAT 16 MILLION

ADDITIONAL PEOPLE WILL BE ENROLLED IN MEDICAID BY 2019.

WE ALSO MUST GIVE DISCOUNTS OR REBATES ON PURCHASES OR REIMBURSEMENTS

OF PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS BY CERTAIN OTHER FEDERAL AND STATE AGENCIES AND PROGRAMS. SEE THE DISCUSSION REGARDING REBATES IN THE

IN OUR 2011 FINANCIAL REPORT, WHICH DISCUSSIONS ARE INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE.

PDUFA REAUTHORIZATION.

THE PRESCRIPTION DRUG USER FEE ACT (PDUFA) WAS FIRST ENACTED IN 1992 TO PROVIDE THE FDA

WITH ADDITIONAL RESOURCES TO SPEED THE REVIEW OF IMPORTANT NEW MEDICINES. PRIOR TO PDUFA, INADEQUATE FUNDING OF THE FDA DRUG REVIEW PROCESS LED TO A BACKLOG OF APPLICATION REVIEWS AND LENGTHY REVIEW TIMES. PDUFA REVOLUTIONIZED THE REVIEW PROCESS FOR

NEW DRUGS AND BIOLOGICS WITHOUT COMPROMISING HIGH APPROVAL STANDARDS FOR DEMONSTRATION OF PRODUCT SAFETY, QUALITY AND EFFICACY. PDUFA SUNSETS EVERY FIVE YEARS AND MUST BE REAUTHORIZED BY CONGRESS. PDUFA IV WILL EXPIRE IN SEPTEMBER 2012. THE PROPOSED

PDUFA V REAUTHORIZATION IS THE PRODUCT OF MONTHS OF STAKEHOLDER DISCUSSION BETWEEN THE FDA, INDUSTRY, PATIENT GROUPS AND CONSUMERS. THE PDUFA V AGREEMENT FOCUSES ON THREE AREAS: MODERNIZING REGULATORY SCIENCE, REVIEW PROCESS ENHANCEMENTS, AND

STRENGTHENING POST-MARKET SAFETY SURVEILLANCE, WITH THE GOAL OF SUPPORTING AGENCY SCIENTIFIC CAPABILITIES AND IMPROVING PROCESS EFFICIENCIES. PFIZER SUPPORTS THE PDUFA V REAUTHORIZATION IN ORDER TO FOSTER AN INNOVATION-SUPPORTIVE REGULATORY

ENVIRONMENT AND TO ENSURE THAT THE FDA IS PROPERLY EQUIPPED TO EVALUATE IMPORTANT NEW MEDICINES IN A TIMELY AND PREDICTABLE FASHION.

IMPORTATION OF DRUGS.

THERE CONTINUE TO BE LEGISLATIVE PROPOSALS TO AMEND U.S. LAW TO ALLOW THE IMPORTATION INTO THE U.S. OF PRESCRIPTION DRUGS FROM OUTSIDE THE U.S., WHICH CAN BE SOLD AT PRICES

THAT ARE REGULATED BY THE GOVERNMENTS OF VARIOUS FOREIGN COUNTRIES. IN ADDITION TO WELL-DOCUMENTED SAFETY CONCERNS, SUCH AS THE INCREASED RISK OF COUNTERFEIT PRODUCTS ENTERING THE SUPPLY CHAIN, SUCH IMPORTATION COULD IMPACT PHARMACEUTICAL PRICES IN

THE U.S. WHILE THE 2003 MEDICARE MODERNIZATION ACT (2003 MMA) MAINTAINS A PROHIBITION ON SUCH IMPORTS, IT WOULD ALLOW IMPORTATION FROM CANADA IF THE SECRETARY OF HHS CERTIFIES THAT SUCH IMPORTATION IS SAFE AND WOULD RESULT IN SAVINGS TO CONSUMERS.

BEFORE THE 2003 MMA, FEDERAL LAW WOULD HAVE PERMITTED IMPORTATION OF MEDICINES INTO THE U.S. FROM A CONSIDERABLY LARGER GROUP OF DEVELOPED COUNTRIES, PROVIDED THE SECRETARY OF HHS MADE THE SAME SAFETY AND COST-SAVINGS CERTIFICATIONS. AS PART OF THE

DEBATE ON THE ACA, TWO SENATE PROPOSALS THAT WOULD HAVE RESTORED THE BROADER NUMBER OF COUNTRIES FROM WHICH IMPORTATION WOULD BE PERMISSIBLE WERE INTRODUCED BUT WERE ULTIMATELY DEFEATED.

21

THE SECRETARIES OF HHS IN THE CLINTON, GEORGE W. BUSH, AND OBAMA ADMINISTRATIONS HAVE ALL

DECLINED TO CERTIFY THAT IMPORTATION OF MEDICINES IS SAFE AND SAVES MONEY. IF THE SECRETARY OF HHS CHANGES ITS POSITION, AN INCREASE IN CROSS-BORDER TRADE IN MEDICINES SUBJECT TO FOREIGN PRICE CONTROLS IN OTHER COUNTRIES COULD OCCUR, WHICH COULD

HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

IN DECEMBER 2004, HHS AND THE DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE ISSUED

REPORTS ON DRUG IMPORTATION AND FOREIGN PRICE CONTROLS. THE HHS REPORT NOTED THAT IT WOULD BE EXTRAORDINARILY DIFFICULT TO ENSURE THAT DRUGS PERSONALLY IMPORTED BY INDIVIDUAL CONSUMERS COULD MEET THE STANDARDS OF SAFETY THAT WOULD

SUPPORT CERTIFYING SUCH IMPORTATION AS SAFE. WHILE THE REPORT ALSO CONCLUDED THAT THE U.S. COULD ESTABLISH A FEASIBLE BASIS FOR COMMERCIAL DRUG IMPORTATION, SUCH A CHANGE IN THE LAW WOULD REQUIRE NEW LEGAL AUTHORITIES, SUBSTANTIAL ADDITIONAL

RESOURCES AND SIGNIFICANT RESTRICTIONS ON THE TYPES OF DRUGS THAT COULD BE IMPORTED. THE REPORT ALSO NOTED THAT THE TOTAL SAVINGS TO BE EXPECTED FROM SUCH A COMMERCIAL IMPORTATION REGIME WOULD BE RELATIVELY SMALL1% OR 2% OF TOTAL DRUG

SPENDING IN THE U.S.

BUDGET CONTROL ACT OF 2011

. IN AUGUST 2011, THE FEDERAL BUDGET CONTROL ACT OF 2011 (THE ACT) WAS

ENACTED IN THE U.S. THE ACT INCLUDES PROVISIONS TO RAISE THE U.S. TREASURY DEPARTMENTS BORROWING LIMIT, KNOWN AS THE DEBT CEILING, AND PROVISIONS TO REDUCE THE FEDERAL DEFICIT BY $2.4 TRILLION BETWEEN 2012 AND 2021. DEFICIT-REDUCTION TARGETS

INCLUDE $900 BILLION OF DISCRETIONARY SPENDING REDUCTIONS ASSOCIATED WITH HHS AND VARIOUS AGENCIES CHARGED WITH NATIONAL SECURITY, BUT THOSE DISCRETIONARY SPENDING REDUCTIONS DO NOT INCLUDE PROGRAMS SUCH AS MEDICARE AND MEDICAID OR DIRECT CHANGES TO

PHARMACEUTICAL PRICING, REBATES OR DISCOUNTS. A JOINT SELECT COMMITTEE OF CONGRESS (THE COMMITTEE) WAS APPOINTED TO IDENTIFY THE REMAINING $1.5 TRILLION OF DEFICIT REDUCTIONS BY NOVEMBER 23, 2011, BUT NO RECOMMENDATIONS WERE MADE BY THE

COMMITTEE PRIOR TO THE DEADLINE. AS A RESULT, THE OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET (OMB) IS NOW RESPONSIBLE FOR IDENTIFYING THE REMAINING $1.5 TRILLION OF DEFICIT REDUCTIONS, WHICH WILL BE DIVIDED EVENLY BETWEEN DEFENSE AND NON-DEFENSE SPENDING.

UNDER THIS OMB FALLBACK REVIEW PROCESS, SOCIAL SECURITY, MEDICAID, VETERAN BENEFITS AND CERTAIN OTHER SPENDING CATEGORIES ARE EXCLUDED FROM CONSIDERATION, BUT REDUCTIONS IN PAYMENTS TO MEDICARE PROVIDERS MAY BE MADE, ALTHOUGH ANY SUCH REDUCTIONS ARE

PROHIBITED BY LAW FROM EXCEEDING 2%. ADDITIONALLY, CERTAIN PAYMENTS TO MEDICARE PART D PLANS, SUCH AS LOW-INCOME SUBSIDY PAYMENTS, ARE EXEMPT FROM REDUCTION. WHILE WE DO NOT KNOW THE SPECIFIC NATURE OF THE SPENDING REDUCTIONS UNDER THE ACT THAT WILL

AFFECT MEDICARE, WE DO NOT EXPECT THAT THOSE REDUCTIONS WILL HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. HOWEVER, ANY SIGNIFICANT SPENDING REDUCTIONS AFFECTING MEDICARE, MEDICAID OR OTHER PUBLICLY FUNDED OR SUBSIDIZED HEALTH

PROGRAMS THAT MAY BE IMPLEMENTED, AND/OR ANY SIGNIFICANT ADDITIONAL TAXES OR FEES THAT MAY BE IMPOSED ON US, AS PART OF ANY BROADER DEFICIT-REDUCTION EFFORT, COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES

WE ENCOUNTER SIMILAR REGULATORY AND LEGISLATIVE ISSUES IN MOST OTHER COUNTRIES. IN EUROPE, CANADA AND SOME OTHER INTERNATIONAL MARKETS, GOVERNMENTS PROVIDE HEALTHCARE AT LOW DIRECT COST TO CONSUMERS AND

REGULATE PHARMACEUTICAL PRICES OR PATIENT REIMBURSEMENT LEVELS TO CONTROL COSTS FOR THE GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED HEALTHCARE SYSTEM. THIS INTERNATIONAL PATCHWORK OF PRICE REGULATION HAS LED TO DIFFERENT PRICES AND SOME THIRD-PARTY TRADE IN OUR PRODUCTS

BETWEEN COUNTRIES.

EUROPE.

THE APPROVAL OF NEW DRUGS ACROSS THE EU MAY BE ACHIEVED USING THE MUTUAL RECOGNITION

PROCEDURE/DECENTRALIZED PROCEDURE OR EU COMMISSION/EMA CENTRALIZED PROCEDURE. THESE PROCEDURES APPLY IN THE EU MEMBER STATES, PLUS THE EUROPEAN ECONOMIC AREA COUNTRIES, NORWAY AND ICELAND. THE USE OF THESE PROCEDURES GENERALLY PROVIDES A MORE RAPID

AND CONSISTENT APPROVAL PROCESS ACROSS THE MEMBER STATES THAN WAS THE CASE WHEN THE APPROVAL PROCESSES WERE OPERATING INDEPENDENTLY WITHIN EACH COUNTRY.

SINCE THE EU DOES NOT HAVE JURISDICTION OVER PATIENT REIMBURSEMENT OR PRICING MATTERS IN ITS MEMBER STATES, WE CONTINUE TO WORK WITH INDIVIDUAL COUNTRIES ON SUCH MATTERS ACROSS THE REGION.

22

THE WORLD ECONOMY IN 2011 FACED RENEWED CHALLENGES AS A RESULT OF RECENT FINANCIAL

CONDITIONS AND, IN PARTICULAR, INCREASED UNCERTAINTY AROUND THE SOLVENCY OF GOVERNMENTS. AS A RESULT, GLOBAL GROWTH HAS SLOWED. ONE OF THE CONSEQUENCES OF THE ECONOMIC DOWNTURN FOR ALMOST ALL WORLD ECONOMIES HAS BEEN AN INCREASE IN PUBLIC DEBT AS A

PROPORTION OF GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT ARISING FROM INCREASED GOVERNMENT SPENDING AND REDUCED TAX RECEIPTS. FOR MANY DEVELOPED ECONOMIES, PARTICULARLY IN EUROPE, THIS EXACERBATED EXISTING FISCAL IMBALANCES AND HAS CREATED DOUBT IN INVESTMENT MARKETS

ABOUT THE SUSTAINABILITY OF PUBLIC DEBT LEVELS IN A NUMBER OF EUROPEAN COUNTRIES, FURTHER RAISING THE COST OF BORROWING, WITH THE RESULT THAT FINANCIAL SUPPORT FROM THE EU AND THE INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND HAS BEEN NECESSARY IN THE CASES OF

GREECE, PORTUGAL AND IRELAND. STRINGENT AUSTERITY MEASURES HAVE BEEN IMPLEMENTED IN MOST EUROPEAN COUNTRIES WITH THE AIM OF CLOSING THE FISCAL GAP, IN PARTICULAR IN SPAIN AND ITALY.

UNDER THESE MACROECONOMIC CONDITIONS, PFIZER CONTINUES TO FACE WIDESPREAD DOWNWARD PRESSURES ON INTERNATIONAL PRICING AND

REIMBURSEMENT, PARTICULARLY IN DEVELOPED EUROPEAN MARKETS WITH A LARGE GOVERNMENT SHARE OF PHARMACEUTICAL SPENDING. SPECIFIC PRICING PRESSURES IN 2011 INCLUDED MEASURES TO REDUCE PHARMACEUTICAL PRICES AND EXPENDITURE IN ITALY, SPAIN, GREECE, IRELAND

AND PORTUGAL.

FORMAL PROCESSES OF INTERNATIONAL REFERENCE PRICING (IRP) BETWEEN EU COUNTRIES ADD TO THE REGIONAL IMPACT OF

PRICE CUTS IN INDIVIDUAL COUNTRIES. PRICE VARIATIONS HAVE ALSO ARISEN FROM EXCHANGE RATE FLUCTUATIONS BETWEEN THE EURO AND OTHER EUROPEAN CURRENCIES, AND THESE ARE ALSO EXACERBATED BY INTERNATIONAL REFERENCE PRICING SYSTEMS. THE DOWNWARD PRICING

PRESSURE RESULTING FROM THIS DYNAMIC CAN BE EXPECTED TO INTENSIFY AS A RESULT OF REFORMS TO IRP POLICIES, EMERGENCY MEASURES TARGETING PHARMACEUTICALS IN SOME EUROPEAN COUNTRIES AND ONGOING EXCHANGE RATE TURBULENCE.

ON JANUARY 26, 2007, THE NEW EU REGULATION ON MEDICINES FOR PEDIATRIC USE BECAME EFFECTIVE. THIS INTRODUCED NEW OBLIGATIONS ON

PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES TO CONDUCT RESEARCH ON THEIR MEDICINES FOR CHILDREN AND, SUBJECT TO VARIOUS CONDITIONS, OFFERED THE POSSIBILITY OF INCENTIVES FOR SO DOING, INCLUDING EXCLUSIVITY EXTENSIONS. THE AIM OF THIS REGULATION IS TO IMPROVE THE

HEALTH OF CHILDREN IN THE EU THROUGH HIGH QUALITY RESEARCH, STIMULATING THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW MEDICINES, CREATING INFRASTRUCTURE TO ENABLE AUTHORIZED USE AND IMPROVING THE INFORMATION ON MEDICINES FOR CHILDREN. A PEDIATRIC COMMITTEE (PDCO) WAS

CREATED WITHIN THE EMA TO PROVIDE SCIENTIFIC OPINIONS AND INPUT ON DEVELOPMENT PLANS FOR MEDICINES FOR USE WITH CHILDREN. IN LINE WITH THIS REGULATION, PFIZER IS CONDUCTING MANY PEDIATRIC RESEARCH PROGRAMS FOR ITS IN-LINE AND DEVELOPMENT PRODUCTS,

AND COMPLETED ITS FIRST EMA-APPROVED PEDIATRIC INVESTIGATION PLAN (FOR

LIPITOR

) IN 2009.

ON DECEMBER 31, 2010,

THE EU PUBLISHED NEW PHARMACOVIGILANCE LEGISLATION WHICH HAD BEEN ADOPTED BY THE COUNCIL AND PARLIAMENT OF THE EU. THE LEGISLATION IS REQUIRED TO BE IMPLEMENTED BY MID-2012 AND ENTAILS MANY NEW AND REVISED REQUIREMENTS FOR CONDUCTING

PHARMACOVIGILANCE, AS WELL AS THE CODIFICATION OF VARIOUS EXISTING REQUIREMENTS PREVIOUSLY SET OUT IN GUIDANCE. KEY CHANGES INCLUDE THE POSSIBILITY FOR REGULATORS TO REQUIRE PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES TO CONDUCT POST-AUTHORIZATION EFFICACY STUDIES,

BOTH AT THE TIME OF APPROVAL AND AT ANY TIME AFTERWARDS IN LIGHT OF SCIENTIFIC DEVELOPMENTS. THERE ARE ALSO ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS TO INCLUDE STATEMENTS IN PRODUCT LABELING WITH REGARD TO ADVERSE DRUG REACTION REPORTING AND ADDITIONAL MONITORING OF

PRODUCTS. THERE ALSO IS EXPECTED TO BE SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER TRANSPARENCY OF THE SAFETY REVIEW PROCESS.

THE NEW LEGISLATION

FORMS PART OF A THREE-PART PHARMACEUTICAL PACKAGE TO AMEND THE EXISTING EU PHARMACEUTICAL LEGISLATION. THE SECOND PART, ADOPTED ON MAY 27, 2011, IS A DIRECTIVE AIMED AT PREVENTING FALSIFIED MEDICINES FROM ENTERING INTO THE LEGAL

SUPPLY CHAIN. NOTABLY, THE DIRECTIVE IMPOSES NEW OBLIGATIONS ON ALL PARTIES IN THE DISTRIBUTION CHAIN, INCLUDING IMPORTERS, TRADERS, MANUFACTURERS, DISTRIBUTORS, AND ANY OPERATOR WHO REPACKAGES A PRODUCT. THIS IS REQUIRED TO BE IMPLEMENTED BY

JANUARY 2013. THE THIRD PART OF THE PACKAGE CONCERNS THE PROVISION OF INFORMATION ON PRESCRIPTION MEDICINES TO PATIENTS, WHICH HAS REACHED A REASONABLY ADVANCED STAGE, BUT HAS PROVED CONTROVERSIAL TO DATE AND THE OUTCOME FOR WHICH IS MORE UNCERTAIN.

AT THE END OF THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2010, THE COMMISSIONER FOR INDUSTRY AND ENTREPRENEURSHIP OF THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION

ANNOUNCED THE LAUNCH OF A PROCESS ON CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY IN THE PHARMACEUTICAL

23

INDUSTRY, THE IMPACT OF WHICH IS YET TO BE DETERMINED THROUGH ONGOING WORKING COMMITTEES. THE PROCESS INCLUDES THREE INDEPENDENT PLATFORMS: (I) TRANSPARENCY AND ETHICS IN THE SECTOR;

(II) ACCESS TO MEDICINES IN AFRICA; AND (III) ACCESS TO MEDICINES IN EUROPE IN THE CONTEXT OF PRICING AND REIMBURSEMENT. THE PLATFORM ON ACCESS TO MEDICINES IN EUROPE WILL FOCUS ON ENHANCING COLLABORATION AMONG EU MEMBER STATES AND

RELEVANT STAKEHOLDERS, IN ORDER TO FIND COMMON NON-REGULATORY APPROACHES TO ENSURE TIMELY AND EQUITABLE ACCESS TO MEDICINES.

CANADA

. HEALTH CANADA (HC) IS THE GOVERNMENT AGENCY THAT PROVIDES REGULATORY AND MARKETING APPROVAL FOR DRUGS AND THERAPEUTIC PRODUCTS IN CANADA. THE UPCOMING LEGISLATIVE AND REGULATORY

MODERNIZATION (LRM) IS THE MOST SIGNIFICANT DRUG REGULATORY SYSTEM REFORM IN CANADA IN OVER 50 YEARS AND IS EXPECTED TO OVERHAUL CANADAS FOOD AND DRUGS ACT AND REGULATIONS. THE LRM SUPPORTS A LIFECYCLE REGULATORY APPROACH AND IS

FOCUSED ON STRENGTHENING EVIDENCE-BASED DECISION MAKING, GOOD REGULATORY PLANNING, LICENSING, POST-LICENSING, ACCOUNTABILITY, AUTHORITY AND ENFORCEMENT. THROUGH THIS FRAMEWORK, HC INTENDS TO IMPROVE THE MARKET AUTHORIZATION PROCESS AND IMPLEMENT

NECESSARY REGULATORY FRAMEWORKS. IN OCTOBER 2010, HC ACCELERATED ITS MODERNIZATION EFFORTS. THIS INCLUDED THE PROPOSED REGULATORY PATHWAYS FOR ORPHAN DRUGS (HARMONIZED WITH U.S./EU REGULATIONS) AND FOR BIOSIMILARS REFERRED TO AS SUBSEQUENT

ENTRY BIOLOGICS (SEBS). THIS WOULD FORMALIZE INTO REGULATIONS HCS GUIDANCE DOCUMENT, WHICH PROVIDED FOR APPROVAL OF SEBS IN 2009. FURTHERMORE, LRM IS TO ENTAIL INCREASED REGULATORY OVERSIGHT THROUGHOUT THE DRUG LIFECYCLE TO CONTINUALLY

ASSESS THE BENEFIT-RISK BALANCE. FOLLOWING AN EXTENSIVE TECHNICAL CONSULTATION PROCESS, HC INTENDS TO PROPOSE A FIRST SET OF REGULATORY AMENDMENTS AROUND THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2012. THE WHOLE LRM PROCESS IS EXPECTED TO TAKE PLACE OVER A PERIOD OF

THREE YEARS.

INTRODUCTORY NON-EXCESSIVE PRICES AND PRICE INCREASES ARE CONTROLLED BY THE FEDERAL PATENTED

MEDICINES PRICES REVIEW BOARD. HOWEVER, REIMBURSEMENT IS UNDER PROVINCIAL JURISDICTION. AS PROVINCES CONTINUE TO FACE BUDGET PRESSURE FROM GROWING HEALTHCARE EXPENDITURES, MANY PROVINCIAL GOVERNMENTS HAVE DEVELOPED PRICING AND PURCHASING STRATEGIES

(INCLUDING PRODUCT LISTING AGREEMENTS AND A PAN-CANADIAN PURCHASING ALLIANCE INITIATIVE), TO OBTAIN BETTER DRUG PRICES. THE PRIVATE SECTOR IS ALSO ATTEMPTING TO EXERT ITS NEGOTIATING POWER ON DRUG MANUFACTURERS. THE 2004

FEDERAL-PROVINCIAL-TERRITORIAL (FPT) HEALTH ACCORD THAT SETS OUT THE CANADA HEALTH TRANSFERS PAYMENT TO PROVINCES PLUS COMMITMENTS ON HEALTH POLICY INITIATIVES EXPIRES ON MARCH 31, 2014. RENEGOTIATION WILL BE INFLUENCED BY THE CHALLENGING

FISCAL POSITIONS OF ALL FPT GOVERNMENTS, WHICH COULD INCREASE HURDLES FOR ACCESS TO NEWER INNOVATIVE THERAPIES.

CANADAS

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY REGIME FOR DRUGS, WHICH PROVIDES SOME LEVEL OF PATENT PROTECTION AND DATA EXCLUSIVITY, CAN BE FURTHER ENHANCED TO ENCOURAGE INNOVATION THROUGH THE CANADA/EU COMPREHENSIVE ECONOMIC & TRADE AGREEMENT. THE FEDERAL

GOVERNMENT ALSO HAS JURISDICTION OVER INTERNATIONAL TRADE AND THEREFORE OVER THE ISSUE OF CROSS-BORDER TRADE IN PHARMACEUTICALS AND INTERNET PHARMACIES.

ASIA.

THE REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT IN ASIA PRESENTS MULTIPLE ISSUES FOR COMPANIES TRYING TO ACHIEVE SIMULTANEOUS GLOBAL DEVELOPMENT AND REGISTRATION (I.E., MARKETING PRODUCTS AT THE SAME TIME AS IN

THE U.S., EUROPE, CANADA AND ELSEWHERE). WHILE EACH COUNTRY IN ASIA HAS ITS UNIQUE REGULATORY CONCERNS, THERE ARE A NUMBER OF REGULATORY ISSUES THAT ARE COMMON AMONG THE MAJORITY OF COUNTRIES IN ASIA. FOR EXAMPLE, WITH THE EXCEPTION OF JAPAN, HEALTH

AUTHORITIES IN ASIA GENERALLY REQUIRE MARKETING APPROVAL BY A RECOGNIZED REGULATORY AUTHORITY (E.G., THE U.S. FDA) BEFORE THEY BEGIN TO CONDUCT THEIR APPLICATION REVIEW PROCESS AND/OR ISSUE THEIR FINAL APPROVAL. PROOF OF REFERENCE COUNTRY APPROVAL

IS USUALLY SATISFIED BY SUBMITTING A CERTIFICATE OF PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCT, A LEGAL DOCUMENT THAT IS ISSUED BY THE COMPETENT HEALTH AUTHORITY CERTIFYING THAT THE COMPANYS PRODUCT HAS SATISFIED ITS COUNTRYS REGISTRATION REQUIREMENTS AND

MANUFACTURING STANDARDS. OFTEN, THIS REQUIREMENT DELAYS MARKETING AUTHORIZATION IN ASIA BY 12-15 MONTHS FOLLOWING MARKET AUTHORIZATION IN THE U.S. AND EUROPE.

ANOTHER COMMON REGULATORY ISSUE IN ASIA IS THE REQUIREMENT FOR LOCAL CLINICAL DATA IN THE COUNTRYS POPULATION IN ORDER TO RECEIVE FINAL MARKETING APPROVAL. EACH OF JAPAN, CHINA, KOREA, TAIWAN AND

INDIA HAS REGULATIONS IN SOME FORM THAT REQUIRE CLINICAL STUDIES IN THE COUNTRY (E.G., CHINA REQUIRES A PRESCRIBED NUMBER OF CHINESE PATIENTS REGARDLESS OF THE PRODUCT, THERAPEUTIC AREA OR DISEASE POPULATION). ALTHOUGH SOME AGENCIES HAVE

24

SHOWN FLEXIBILITY BASED ON SCIENTIFIC RATIONALE RELATED TO ETHNICITY ASSESSMENTS, IT IS NOT UNCOMMON FOR COMPANIES TO BE REQUIRED TO DUPLICATE COSTLY CLINICAL TRIALS IN ASIA PURSUANT TO THESE

REGULATIONS. THIS CAN FURTHER ADD TO MARKETING APPROVAL DELAYS COMPARED TO THE U.S. AND EUROPE.

IN JAPAN, THE GOVERNMENT IS

AIMING TO REDUCE THE DRUG LAG (I.E., DRUGS ARE LAUNCHED IN JAPAN YEARS AFTER THE EU AND U.S. MARKETS) IN A TWO-PRONGED APPROACH: REDUCING REGULATORY AGENCY REVIEW TIMES AND ESTABLISHING A NEW PILOT PRICING PREMIUM. THE PILOT PRICING PREMIUM PROVIDES

A FINANCIAL INCENTIVE FOR DRUG DEVELOPMENT IN JAPAN. WHILE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND GOVERNMENT DEBT LEVELS CONTINUE TO PUT PRESSURE ON HEALTHCARE COSTS RESULTING IN COST CONTAINMENT (PARTICULARLY IN THE OFF-PATENT SECTOR) THE RECENT EXTENSION OF THE

PILOT PRICING PREMIUM FOR INNOVATIVE PRODUCTS IS ENCOURAGING.

IN KOREA, THE NATIONAL HEALTH INSURANCE DEFICIT PROMPTED THE

GOVERNMENT TO MAKE SIGNIFICANT PRICE CUTS IN THE OFF-PATENT SECTOR AT THE END OF 2011. WE CONTINUE TO WORK WITH A COMMITTEE ESTABLISHED BY THE GOVERNMENT TO IMPROVE THE PRICING SYSTEM FOR INNOVATIVE NEW DRUGS.

THE CONTROLLING REGULATORY AGENCY IN CHINA IS THE STATE FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION (SFDA). SFDAS SCOPE OF RESPONSIBILITIES IS

SIMILAR TO THAT OF THE FDA OR EMA. TWO KEY AGENCIES WITHIN SFDA ARE THE CENTER FOR DRUG EVALUATION (CDE) AND THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE FOR THE CONTROL OF PHARMACEUTICAL AND BIOLOGICAL PRODUCTS (NICPBP). THE CDE, WHICH IS ANALOGOUS TO THE FDAS

CENTER FOR DRUG EVALUATION AND RESEARCH, IS PRIMARILY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE TECHNICAL REVIEW OF PRODUCT APPLICATIONS, INCLUDING CLINICAL TRIAL APPLICATIONS AND NEW DRUG APPLICATIONS, AND DRAFTING TECHNICAL GUIDANCE DOCUMENTS. NICPBP IS THE QUALITY

TESTING ARM OF SFDA, LEGALLY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE TESTING OF PHARMACEUTICALS, BIOLOGICS AND MEDICAL DEVICES NATIONWIDE.

CHINAS REGULATORY SYSTEM IS UNIQUE IN MANY WAYS, AND ITS DRUG DEVELOPMENT AND REGISTRATION REQUIREMENTS ARE NOT ALWAYS CONSISTENT

WITH INTERNATIONAL STANDARDS. AS A RESULT, IT IS NOT UNCOMMON TO SEE TREATMENTS ENTERING THE MARKET IN CHINA TWO TO FOUR YEARS AFTER FIRST MARKETING IN THE U.S. AND EUROPE.

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

. WHILE THE GLOBAL INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY ENVIRONMENT HAS IMPROVED FOLLOWING WTO-TRIPS, OUR FUTURE BUSINESS GROWTH DEPENDS ON FURTHER PROGRESS IN INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

PROTECTION. IN EMERGING MARKET COUNTRIES IN PARTICULAR, GOVERNMENTS HAVE USED INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY POLICIES AS A TOOL FOR REDUCING THE PRICE OF IMPORTED MEDICINES, AS WELL AS TO PROTECT THEIR NATIONAL PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRIES. THERE IS

CONSIDERABLE POLITICAL PRESSURE TO WEAKEN EXISTING INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY PROTECTION AND RESIST IMPLEMENTATION OF ANY FURTHER PROTECTION, WHICH HAS LED TO POLICIES SUCH AS HIGHER STANDARDS AND MORE DIFFICULT PROCEDURES FOR PATENTING BIOPHARMACEUTICAL

INVENTIONS, RESTRICTIONS ON PATENTING CERTAIN TYPES OF INVENTIONS (E.G., NEW MEDICAL TREATMENT METHODS) AND FAILURE TO IMPLEMENT EFFECTIVE REGULATORY DATA PROTECTION. OUR INDUSTRY ADVOCACY EFFORTS FOCUS ON SEEKING A MORE BALANCED BUSINESS

ENVIRONMENT FOR FOREIGN MANUFACTURERS.

IN CHINA, THE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY ENVIRONMENT HAS IMPROVED, ALTHOUGH EFFECTIVE

ENFORCEMENT AND ADEQUATE LEGAL REMEDIES REMAIN AREAS OF CONCERN. THE GOVERNMENT HAS TAKEN STEPS TO PROTECT INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS IN CONFORMITY WITH WORLD TRADE ORGANIZATION (WTO) PROVISIONS, AND SEVERAL COMPANIES, INCLUDING PFIZER, HAVE

ESTABLISHED RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT CENTERS IN CHINA DUE TO INCREASED CONFIDENCE IN CHINAS INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY ENVIRONMENT. DESPITE THIS, CHINA REMAINED ON THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE PRIORITY WATCH LIST FOR 2011. A FRAMEWORK EXISTS FOR

PROTECTING PATENTS FOR 20 YEARS, BUT ENFORCEMENT MECHANISMS ARE OFTEN LACKING OR INCONSISTENT, SUCH AS THE ABSENCE OF EFFECTIVE PATENT LINKAGE MECHANISMS AND PRELIMINARY INJUNCTIONS, IMPRACTICAL EVIDENTIARY BURDENS, AND HEIGHTENED SUFFICIENCY

STANDARDS USED TO INVALIDATE PATENTS AT THE ENFORCEMENT STAGE.

ADDITIONALLY, TRUE REGULATORY DATA PROTECTION REMAINS ELUSIVE

IN CHINA. THE CENTER FOR DRUG EVALUATION PROVIDES PROTECTION AGAINST RELIANCE ON DATA BY GENERIC APPLICANTS FOR A FIXED PERIOD OF TIME. FOLLOWING ITS WTO ACCESSION IN 2001, CHINA REVISED ITS LAWS TO INCORPORATE CONCEPTS FROM THE WTO-TRIPS, AND

CHINAS RELEVANT LAWS ESTABLISH A SIX-YEAR PERIOD OF PROTECTION AGAINST UNFAIR COMMERCIAL USE OF UNDISCLOSED TEST AND OTHER DATA OF PRODUCTS CONTAINING A NEW CHEMICAL INGREDIENT. HOWEVER, THE CURRENT REGULATIONS ARE AMBIGUOUS AS TO HOW DATA

PROTECTION IS IMPLEMENTED IN PRACTICE IN CHINA. FOR EXAMPLE, CERTAIN KEY CONCEPTS SUCH AS NEW CHEMICAL INGREDIENT AND UNFAIR COMMERCIAL USE ARE UNDEFINED.

25

IN BRAZIL AND OTHER LATIN AMERICAN COUNTRIES, BACKLOGS AT PATENT AGENCIES HAVE PRESENTED

CHALLENGES FOR THE PROTECTION OF CERTAIN PRODUCTS. THE LACK OF REGULATORY DATA PROTECTION AND DIFFICULTIES IN PROTECTING CERTAIN TYPES OF INVENTIONS, SUCH AS NEW MEDICAL USES OF DRUG PRODUCTS, MAY LIMIT THE COMMERCIAL LIFESPAN OF SOME PHARMACEUTICAL

PRODUCTS.

IN INDIA, LIMITED STANDARDS FOR PATENTABILITY OF PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS HAVE MADE IT DIFFICULT TO PROTECT MANY OF

OUR INVENTIONS. INDIA AND OTHER COUNTRIES SUCH AS ISRAEL MAINTAIN A SYSTEM OF PRE-GRANT PATENT OPPOSITIONS THAT DELAY THE GRANTING OF PATENTS AND ADD AN ADDITIONAL CHALLENGE IN OUR ABILITY TO PROTECT OUR PRODUCTS THROUGH PATENTS.

IN KOREA, THE LAWS AND REGULATIONS FOR THE PATENT-REGULATORY APPROVAL LINKAGE SYSTEM HAVE NOW BEEN FINALIZED, AND WE ARE WAITING FOR THE

EFFECTIVE DATE OF IMPLEMENTATION AS PART OF THE UNITED STATES-KOREA FREE TRADE AGREEMENT. THE KOREAN PATENT-REGULATORY APPROVAL LINKAGE SYSTEM INCLUDES BIOLOGICS.

ENVIRONMENTAL LAW COMPLIANCE

MOST OF OUR

OPERATIONS ARE AFFECTED BY NATIONAL, STATE AND/OR LOCAL ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS. WE HAVE MADE, AND INTEND TO CONTINUE TO MAKE, NECESSARY EXPENDITURES FOR COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE LAWS. WE ALSO ARE CLEANING UP ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINATION FROM PAST

INDUSTRIAL ACTIVITY AT CERTAIN SITES. SEE THE NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

NOTE 17. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

IN OUR 2011 FINANCIAL REPORT. AS A RESULT, WE INCURRED CAPITAL AND OPERATIONAL EXPENDITURES IN 2011 FOR

ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLIANCE PURPOSES AND FOR THE CLEAN-UP OF CERTAIN PAST INDUSTRIAL ACTIVITY AS FOLLOWS.



ENVIRONMENT-RELATED CAPITAL EXPENDITURES$34 MILLION; AND



OTHER ENVIRONMENT-RELATED EXPENSES$145 MILLION.

WHILE WE CANNOT PREDICT WITH CERTAINTY FUTURE CAPITAL EXPENDITURES OR OPERATING COSTS FOR ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLIANCE, INCLUDING COMPLIANCE WITH PENDING AND POTENTIAL LEGISLATION AND POTENTIAL REGULATION

RELATED TO CLIMATE CHANGE, WE HAVE NO REASON TO BELIEVE THEY WILL HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON OUR CAPITAL EXPENDITURES OR COMPETITIVE POSITION.

WE HAVE REVIEWED THE POTENTIAL FOR PHYSICAL RISKS TO OUR FACILITIES AND SUPPLY CHAIN THAT MAY BE EXACERBATED BY CLIMATE CHANGE AND HAVE CONCLUDED THAT, BECAUSE OF OUR FACILITY LOCATIONS AND OUR EXISTING

DISTRIBUTION NETWORKS, WE DO NOT BELIEVE THESE RISKS ARE MATERIAL IN THE NEAR TERM.

TAX MATTERS

EMPLOYEES

IN OUR INNOVATION-INTENSIVE BUSINESS, OUR EMPLOYEES ARE VITAL TO OUR SUCCESS. WE BELIEVE WE HAVE GOOD RELATIONSHIPS WITH OUR EMPLOYEES.

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2011, WE EMPLOYED APPROXIMATELY 103,700 PEOPLE IN OUR OPERATIONS THROUGHOUT THE WORLD.

ITEM 1A.

RISK FACTORS

THE

STATEMENTS IN THIS SECTION DESCRIBE THE MAJOR RISKS TO OUR BUSINESS AND SHOULD BE CONSIDERED CAREFULLY. IN ADDITION, THESE STATEMENTS CONSTITUTE OUR CAUTIONARY STATEMENTS UNDER THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995.

THE SEC ENCOURAGES COMPANIES TO DISCLOSE FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION SO THAT INVESTORS CAN BETTER UNDERSTAND A COMPANYS FUTURE

PROSPECTS AND MAKE INFORMED INVESTMENT DECISIONS. OUR DISCLOSURE AND ANALYSIS IN THE 2011 FORM 10-K AND IN OUR 2011 ANNUAL REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS CONTAIN SOME FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS THAT SET FORTH ANTICIPATED RESULTS BASED ON MANAGEMENTS

PLANS AND ASSUMPTIONS. FROM TIME TO TIME, WE ALSO PROVIDE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS IN OTHER MATERIALS WE RELEASE TO THE PUBLIC, AS WELL AS ORAL FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS. SUCH FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS INVOLVE SUBSTANTIAL RISKS AND

UNCERTAINTIES. WE HAVE TRIED, WHEREVER POSSIBLE, TO IDENTIFY SUCH STATEMENTS BY USING WORDS SUCH AS ANTICIPATE, ESTIMATE, EXPECT, PROJECT, INTEND, PLAN, BELIEVE,

WILL, TARGET, FORECAST, GOAL, OBJECTIVE AND OTHER WORDS OR TERMS OF SIMILAR MEANING, OR BY USING FUTURE DATES IN CONNECTION WITH ANY DISCUSSION OF FUTURE OPERATING OR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE,

BUSINESS PLANS OR PROSPECTS, IN-LINE PRODUCTS AND PRODUCT CANDIDATES, STRATEGIC REVIEW, CAPITAL ALLOCATION, AND SHARE-REPURCHASE AND DIVIDEND-RATE PLANS. IN PARTICULAR, THESE INCLUDE STATEMENTS RELATING TO FUTURE ACTIONS, BUSINESS PLANS AND

PROSPECTS, PROSPECTIVE PRODUCTS OR PRODUCT APPROVALS, FUTURE PERFORMANCE OR RESULTS OF CURRENT AND ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS, SALES EFFORTS, EXPENSES, INTEREST RATES, FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES, THE OUTCOME OF CONTINGENCIES, SUCH AS LEGAL PROCEEDINGS,

SHARE-REPURCHASE AND DIVIDEND-RATE PLANS, FINANCIAL RESULTS AND GOVERNMENT REGULATION.

WE CANNOT GUARANTEE THAT ANY

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENT WILL BE REALIZED, ALTHOUGH WE BELIEVE WE HAVE BEEN PRUDENT IN OUR PLANS AND ASSUMPTIONS. ACHIEVEMENT OF FUTURE RESULTS IS SUBJECT TO SUBSTANTIAL RISKS, UNCERTAINTIES AND POTENTIALLY INACCURATE ASSUMPTIONS. SHOULD KNOWN OR

UNKNOWN RISKS OR UNCERTAINTIES MATERIALIZE, OR SHOULD UNDERLYING ASSUMPTIONS PROVE INACCURATE, ACTUAL RESULTS COULD DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM PAST RESULTS AND THOSE ANTICIPATED, ESTIMATED OR PROJECTED. YOU SHOULD BEAR THIS IN MIND AS YOU CONSIDER

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS, AND YOU ARE CAUTIONED NOT TO PUT UNDUE RELIANCE ON FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS.

WE

UNDERTAKE NO OBLIGATION TO PUBLICLY UPDATE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS, WHETHER AS A RESULT OF NEW INFORMATION, FUTURE EVENTS OR OTHERWISE. YOU ARE ADVISED, HOWEVER, TO CONSULT ANY FURTHER DISCLOSURES WE MAKE ON RELATED SUBJECTS IN OUR FORM 10-Q AND

8-K REPORTS AND OUR OTHER FILINGS WITH THE SEC. ALSO NOTE THAT WE PROVIDE THE FOLLOWING CAUTIONARY DISCUSSION OF RISKS, UNCERTAINTIES AND POSSIBLY INACCURATE ASSUMPTIONS RELEVANT TO OUR BUSINESSES. THESE ARE FACTORS THAT, INDIVIDUALLY OR IN THE

AGGREGATE, MAY CAUSE OUR ACTUAL RESULTS TO DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM EXPECTED AND HISTORICAL RESULTS. WE NOTE THESE FACTORS FOR INVESTORS AS PERMITTED BY THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995. YOU SHOULD UNDERSTAND THAT IT IS NOT

POSSIBLE TO PREDICT OR IDENTIFY ALL SUCH FACTORS. CONSEQUENTLY, YOU SHOULD NOT CONSIDER THE FOLLOWING TO BE A COMPLETE DISCUSSION OF ALL POTENTIAL RISKS OR UNCERTAINTIES.

U.S. HEALTHCARE REFORM/HEALTHCARE LEGISLATION

AS MENTIONED ABOVE, THE ACA

WAS ENACTED BY CONGRESS IN MARCH 2010 AND ITS PROVISIONS ARE EFFECTIVE ON VARIOUS DATES. WE EXPECT THAT THE REBATES, DISCOUNTS, TAXES AND OTHER COSTS OVER TIME WILL HAVE A SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON OUR EXPENSES AND PROFITABILITY IN THE FUTURE. SEE THE

DISCUSSION UNDER THE

OVERVIEW OF OUR PERFORMANCE, OPERATING ENVIRONMENT, STRATEGY AND OUTLOOK  OUR OPERATING ENVIRONMENT  U.S. HEALTHCARE LEGISLATION

SECTION OF THE MD&A IN OUR 2011 FINANCIAL REPORT AND IN

ITEM 1.

BUSINESS

UNDER THE CAPTION

GOVERNMENT REGULATION AND PRICE CONSTRAINTS

. FURTHERMORE, THE IPAB CREATED BY THE ACA, TO REDUCE THE PER CAPITA RATE OF GROWTH IN MEDICARE SPENDING, COULD POTENTIALLY LIMIT ACCESS TO CERTAIN TREATMENTS OR

MANDATE PRICE CONTROLS FOR OUR PRODUCTS. MOREOVER, EXPANDED GOVERNMENT INVESTIGATIVE AUTHORITY MAY INCREASE THE COSTS OF COMPLIANCE WITH NEW REGULATIONS AND PROGRAMS. WE ALSO FACE THE UNCERTAINTIES THAT MIGHT RESULT FROM ANY MODIFICATION, REPEAL OR

INVALIDATION OF ANY OF THE PROVISIONS OF THE ACA.

27

PRICING PRESSURES, GOVERNMENT REGULATION AND MANAGED CARE TRENDS

U.S. AND FOREIGN GOVERNMENTAL REGULATIONS MANDATING PRICE CONTROLS AND LIMITATIONS ON PATIENT ACCESS TO OUR PRODUCTS IMPACT OUR BUSINESS,

AND OUR FUTURE RESULTS COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY CHANGES IN SUCH REGULATIONS OR POLICIES. IN THE U.S., MANY OF OUR BIOPHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS ARE SUBJECT TO INCREASING PRICING PRESSURES. SUCH PRESSURES HAVE INCREASED AS A RESULT OF THE 2003 MMA

DUE TO THE ENHANCED PURCHASING POWER OF THE PRIVATE SECTOR PLANS THAT NEGOTIATE ON BEHALF OF MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES. IN ADDITION, IF THE 2003 MMA OR THE ACA WERE AMENDED TO IMPOSE DIRECT GOVERNMENTAL PRICE CONTROLS AND ACCESS RESTRICTIONS, IT WOULD

HAVE A SIGNIFICANT ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR BUSINESS. FURTHERMORE, MCOS, AS WELL AS MEDICAID AND OTHER GOVERNMENT AGENCIES, CONTINUE TO SEEK PRICE DISCOUNTS. SOME STATES HAVE IMPLEMENTED, AND OTHER STATES ARE CONSIDERING, PRICE CONTROLS OR PATIENT

ACCESS CONSTRAINTS UNDER THE MEDICAID PROGRAM, AND SOME STATES ARE CONSIDERING PRICE-CONTROL REGIMES THAT WOULD APPLY TO BROADER SEGMENTS OF THEIR POPULATIONS THAT ARE NOT MEDICAID-ELIGIBLE. OTHER MATTERS ALSO COULD BE THE SUBJECT OF U.S. FEDERAL OR

STATE LEGISLATIVE OR REGULATORY ACTION THAT COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, INCLUDING CHANGES IN PATENT LAWS, THE IMPORTATION OF PRESCRIPTION DRUGS FROM OUTSIDE THE U.S. AT PRICES THAT ARE REGULATED BY THE GOVERNMENTS OF VARIOUS FOREIGN

COUNTRIES, RESTRICTIONS ON U.S. DIRECT-TO-CONSUMER ADVERTISING, LIMITATIONS ON INTERACTIONS WITH HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONALS, OR THE USE OF COMPARATIVE EFFECTIVENESS METHODOLOGIES THAT COULD BE IMPLEMENTED IN A MANNER THAT FOCUSES PRIMARILY ON COST

DIFFERENCES AND MINIMIZES THE THERAPEUTIC DIFFERENCES AMONG PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS AND RESTRICTS ACCESS TO INNOVATIVE MEDICINES.

THE PROHIBITION ON THE USE OF FEDERAL FUNDS FOR REIMBURSEMENT OF ERECTILE DYSFUNCTION MEDICATIONS BY THE MEDICAID PROGRAM, WHICH BECAME EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2006, AND THE SIMILAR FEDERAL FUNDING

PROHIBITION FOR THE MEDICARE PART D PROGRAM, WHICH BECAME EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2007, HAS HAD AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS. ANY PROHIBITIONS ON THE USE OF FEDERAL FUNDS FOR REIMBURSEMENT OF OTHER CLASSES OF DRUGS IN THE FUTURE MAY ALSO HAVE

AN ADVERSE EFFECT.

WE ENCOUNTER SIMILAR REGULATORY AND LEGISLATIVE ISSUES IN MOST OTHER COUNTRIES. IN EUROPE AND SOME OTHER

INTERNATIONAL MARKETS, GOVERNMENTS PROVIDE HEALTHCARE AT LOW DIRECT COST TO CONSUMERS AND REGULATE PHARMACEUTICAL PRICES OR PATIENT REIMBURSEMENT LEVELS TO CONTROL COSTS FOR GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED HEALTHCARE SYSTEMS. IN PARTICULAR, THERE WERE

GOVERNMENT-MANDATED PRICE REDUCTIONS FOR CERTAIN BIOPHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS IN CERTAIN EUROPEAN AND EMERGING MARKET COUNTRIES IN 2011, AND WE ANTICIPATE CONTINUING PRICING PRESSURES IN EUROPE AND EMERGING MARKETS IN 2012. THIS INTERNATIONAL

PATCHWORK OF PRICE REGULATION HAS LED TO DIFFERENT PRICES AND SOME THIRD-PARTY TRADE IN OUR PRODUCTS BETWEEN COUNTRIES. AS A RESULT, IT IS EXPECTED THAT PRESSURES ON THE PRICING COMPONENT OF OPERATING RESULTS WILL CONTINUE. THE ADOPTION OF

RESTRICTIVE PRICE CONTROLS IN NEW JURISDICTIONS OR MORE RESTRICTIVE ONES IN EXISTING JURISDICTIONS, FAILURE TO OBTAIN GOVERNMENT-APPROVED PRICING OR FORMULARY PLACEMENT WHERE REQUIRED FOR OUR PRODUCTS OR OBTAINING SUCH PRICING OR PLACEMENT AT

UNFAVORABLE PRICING COULD ALSO ADVERSELY IMPACT REVENUE. IN OUR VACCINES BUSINESS, WE PARTICIPATE IN A TENDER PROCESS IN MANY COUNTRIES FOR PARTICIPATION IN NATIONAL IMMUNIZATION PROGRAMS. FAILURE TO SECURE PARTICIPATION IN NATIONAL IMMUNIZATION

PROGRAMS OR TO OBTAIN ACCEPTABLE PRICING IN THE TENDER PROCESS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS.

MCOS AND OTHER PRIVATE

INSURERS FREQUENTLY ADOPT THEIR OWN PAYMENT OR REIMBURSEMENT REDUCTIONS. CONSOLIDATION AMONG MCOS HAS INCREASED THE NEGOTIATING POWER OF THESE ENTITIES. PRIVATE THIRD-PARTY PAYERS, AS WELL AS GOVERNMENTS, INCREASINGLY EMPLOY FORMULARIES TO CONTROL

COSTS BY NEGOTIATING DISCOUNTED PRICES IN EXCHANGE FOR FORMULARY INCLUSION. PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE COMPANIES AND SELF-INSURED EMPLOYERS HAVE BEEN RAISING CO-PAYMENTS REQUIRED FROM BENEFICIARIES, PARTICULARLY FOR BRANDED PHARMACEUTICALS AND

BIOTECHNOLOGY PRODUCTS. PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE COMPANIES ALSO ARE INCREASINGLY IMPOSING UTILIZATION MANAGEMENT TOOLS, SUCH AS REQUIRING PRIOR AUTHORIZATION FOR A BRANDED PRODUCT IF A GENERIC PRODUCT IS AVAILABLE OR REQUIRING THAT PATIENT TREATMENT

FIRST FAIL ON A GENERIC PRODUCT BEFORE PERMITTING ACCESS TO A BRANDED MEDICINE. AS THE U.S. PAYER MARKET CONCENTRATES FURTHER AND MORE DRUGS BECOME AVAILABLE IN GENERIC FORM, BIOPHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES MAY FACE GREATER PRICING PRESSURE FROM PRIVATE

THIRD-PARTY PAYERS, WHO WILL CONTINUE TO DRIVE MORE OF THEIR PATIENTS TO USE LOWER COST GENERIC ALTERNATIVES.

28

GENERIC COMPETITION

COMPETITION FROM MANUFACTURERS OF GENERIC DRUGS IS A MAJOR CHALLENGE FOR US AROUND THE WORLD. UPON THE EXPIRATION OR LOSS OF PATENT PROTECTION FOR ONE OF OUR PRODUCTS, OR UPON THE AT-RISK

LAUNCH (DESPITE PENDING PATENT INFRINGEMENT LITIGATION AGAINST THE GENERIC PRODUCT) BY A GENERIC MANUFACTURER OF A GENERIC VERSION OF ONE OF OUR PATENTED PRODUCTS, WE CAN LOSE THE MAJOR PORTION OF SALES OF THAT PRODUCT IN A VERY SHORT PERIOD, WHICH

CAN ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS.

ALSO, THE PATENTS COVERING SEVERAL OF OUR MEDICINES, INCLUDING

LIPITOR

,

VIAGRA

,

DETROL/DETROL LA

,

LYRICA

,

SUTENT

,

TYGACIL

,

RAPAMUNE

,

ZYVOX

,

AVINZA

,

EPIPEN

,

TORISEL

AND

EMBEDA

ARE BEING CHALLENGED BY GENERIC MANUFACTURERS. IN ADDITION,

OUR PATENT-PROTECTED PRODUCTS MAY FACE COMPETITION IN THE FORM OF GENERIC VERSIONS OF COMPETITORS BRANDED PRODUCTS THAT LOSE THEIR MARKET EXCLUSIVITY.

COMPETITIVE PRODUCTS

WE CANNOT PREDICT WITH ACCURACY THE TIMING OR IMPACT

OF THE INTRODUCTION OF COMPETITIVE PRODUCTS OR THEIR POSSIBLE EFFECT ON OUR SALES. PRODUCTS THAT COMPETE WITH OURS, INCLUDING SOME OF OUR BEST-SELLING MEDICINES, ARE LAUNCHED FROM TIME TO TIME. COMPETITIVE PRODUCT LAUNCHES HAVE OCCURRED IN RECENT

YEARS, AND CERTAIN POTENTIALLY COMPETITIVE PRODUCTS ARE IN VARIOUS STAGES OF DEVELOPMENT, SOME OF WHICH HAVE BEEN FILED FOR APPROVAL WITH THE FDA AND WITH REGULATORY AUTHORITIES IN OTHER COUNTRIES.

DEPENDENCE ON KEY IN-LINE PRODUCTS

WE RECORDED DIRECT PRODUCT REVENUES OF MORE THAN $1 BILLION FOR EACH OF 12 BIOPHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS IN 2011.

LIPITOR

,

LYRICA

,

PREVNAR 13/PREVENAR 13

,

ENBREL

,

CELEBREX

,

VIAGRA

,

NORVASC

,

ZYVOX

,

XALATAN/XALACOM

,

SUTENT

,

GEODON/ZELDOX

AND THE

PREMARIN

FAMILY. THOSE PRODUCTS ACCOUNTED FOR 56% OF OUR TOTAL BIOPHARMACEUTICAL REVENUES IN 2011.

LIPITOR

SALES IN 2011

WERE APPROXIMATELY $9.6 BILLION, ACCOUNTING FOR APPROXIMATELY 14% OF OUR TOTAL 2011 REVENUES. AMONG OTHER LOSSES OF EXCLUSIVITY FOR

LIPITOR

, WE LOST EXCLUSIVITY FOR

LIPITOR

IN THE U.S. ON NOVEMBER 30, 2011, AND

LIPITOR

WILL

HAVE LOST EXCLUSIVITY IN THE MAJORITY OF EUROPEAN MARKETS BY MAY 2012. AS A RESULT, WE EXPECT THAT OUR REVENUES FOR

LIPITOR

IN 2012 WILL BE SUBSTANTIALLY LESS THAN OUR 2011 REVENUES FOR

LIPITOR

. IF THE PRODUCTS REFERENCED ABOVE OR ANY

OF OUR OTHER MAJOR PRODUCTS WERE TO BECOME SUBJECT TO PROBLEMS SUCH AS LOSS OF PATENT PROTECTION, CHANGES IN PRESCRIPTION GROWTH RATES, MATERIAL PRODUCT LIABILITY LITIGATION, UNEXPECTED SIDE EFFECTS, REGULATORY PROCEEDINGS, PUBLICITY AFFECTING

DOCTOR OR PATIENT CONFIDENCE, PRESSURE FROM EXISTING COMPETITIVE PRODUCTS, CHANGES IN LABELING OR, IF A NEW, MORE EFFECTIVE TREATMENT SHOULD BE INTRODUCED, THE ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR REVENUES COULD BE SIGNIFICANT. AS NOTED, PATENTS COVERING SEVERAL

OF OUR BEST-SELLING MEDICINES HAVE RECENTLY EXPIRED OR WILL EXPIRE IN THE NEXT FEW YEARS (INCLUDING SOME OF OUR BILLION-DOLLAR PRODUCTS SUCH AS

LIPITOR

AS DISCUSSED ABOVE,

XALATAN

IN THE U.S. IN MARCH 2011 AND

XALATAN/XALACOM

IN

15 MAJOR EUROPEAN MARKETS IN JANUARY 2012 AND

GEODON

IN THE U.S. IN MARCH 2012), AND PATENTS COVERING A NUMBER OF OUR BEST-SELLING MEDICINES ARE THE SUBJECT OF PENDING LEGAL CHALLENGES. IN ADDITION, OUR REVENUES COULD BE SIGNIFICANTLY

IMPACTED BY THE TIMING AND RATE OF COMMERCIAL ACCEPTANCE OF KEY NEW PRODUCTS.

SPECIALTY PHARMACEUTICALS

SPECIALTY PHARMACEUTICALS ARE MEDICINES THAT TREAT RARE OR LIFE-THREATENING CONDITIONS THAT HAVE SMALLER PATIENT POPULATIONS, SUCH AS

CERTAIN TYPES OF CANCER AND MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS. THE GROWING AVAILABILITY AND USE OF INNOVATIVE SPECIALTY PHARMACEUTICALS, COMBINED WITH THEIR RELATIVE HIGHER COST AS COMPARED TO OTHER TYPES OF PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS, IS BEGINNING TO GENERATE

SIGNIFICANT PAYER INTEREST IN DEVELOPING COST-CONTAINMENT STRATEGIES TARGETED TO THIS SECTOR. WHILE THE IMPACT ON US OF PAYERS EFFORTS TO CONTROL ACCESS TO AND PRICING OF SPECIALTY PHARMACEUTICALS HAS BEEN LIMITED TO DATE, OUR GROWING

PORTFOLIO OF SPECIALTY PRODUCTS, COMBINED WITH THE INCREASING USE OF HEALTH TECHNOLOGY ASSESSMENT IN MARKETS AROUND THE WORLD AND THE DETERIORATING FINANCES OF GOVERNMENTS, MAY LEAD TO A MORE SIGNIFICANT ADVERSE BUSINESS IMPACT IN THE FUTURE.

29

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT INVESTMENT

THE DISCOVERY AND DEVELOPMENT OF SAFE, EFFECTIVE NEW PRODUCTS, AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF ADDITIONAL USES FOR EXISTING PRODUCTS, ARE VERY

IMPORTANT TO OUR SUCCESS. OUR GROWTH POTENTIAL DEPENDS IN LARGE PART ON OUR ABILITY TO IDENTIFY AND DEVELOP NEW PRODUCTS OR NEW INDICATIONS FOR EXISTING PRODUCTS THAT ADDRESS UNMET MEDICAL NEEDS AND RECEIVE REIMBURSEMENT FROM PAYERS, EITHER THROUGH

INTERNAL RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT OR THROUGH COLLABORATIONS, ACQUISITIONS, JOINT VENTURES OR LICENSING OR OTHER ARRANGEMENTS WITH THIRD PARTIES. HOWEVER, BALANCING CURRENT GROWTH AND INVESTMENT FOR THE FUTURE REMAINS A MAJOR CHALLENGE. OUR ONGOING

INVESTMENTS IN NEW PRODUCT INTRODUCTIONS AND IN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT FOR NEW PRODUCTS AND EXISTING PRODUCT EXTENSIONS COULD EXCEED CORRESPONDING SALES GROWTH. THIS COULD PRODUCE HIGHER COSTS WITHOUT A PROPORTIONAL INCREASE IN REVENUES.

ADDITIONALLY, OUR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT INVESTMENT PLANS AND RESOURCES MAY NOT BE CORRECTLY MATCHED BETWEEN SCIENCE AND

MARKETS, AND FAILURE TO INVEST IN THE RIGHT TECHNOLOGY PLATFORMS, THERAPEUTIC SEGMENTS, PRODUCT CLASSES, GEOGRAPHIC MARKETS AND/OR IN-LICENSING AND OUT-LICENSING OPPORTUNITIES IN ORDER TO DELIVER A MORE ROBUST PIPELINE COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT THE

PRODUCTIVITY OF OUR PIPELINE. ADDITIONALLY, EVEN IF THE AREAS WITH THE GREATEST MARKET ATTRACTIVENESS ARE IDENTIFIED, THE SCIENCE MAY NOT WORK FOR ANY GIVEN PROGRAM DESPITE THE SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT REQUIRED FOR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT.

WE RECENTLY ANNOUNCED A FOCUS ON FEWER DISEASE AREAS WHERE WE BELIEVE WE CAN DELIVER THE GREATEST MEDICAL AND COMMERCIAL

SUCCESS, AS WELL AS THE IMPLEMENTATION OF OUR R&D FOOTPRINT REDUCTION BY MOVING FORWARD ON OUR PRODUCTIVITY INITIATIVES. AS A RESULT OF THESE ACTIONS, WE EXPECT SIGNIFICANT REDUCTIONS IN OUR ANNUAL RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES, WHICH ARE

REFLECTED IN OUR 2012 FINANCIAL GUIDANCE. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THIS STRATEGY WILL DELIVER THE DESIRED RESULT IN THE TARGETED TIMEFRAME OR AT ALL, WHICH COULD AFFECT PROFITABILITY IN THE FUTURE.

DEVELOPMENT, REGULATORY APPROVAL AND MARKETING OF PRODUCTS

RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES APPLY PARTICULARLY WITH RESPECT TO PRODUCT-RELATED, FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS. THE OUTCOME OF THE LENGTHY AND COMPLEX PROCESS OF IDENTIFYING NEW COMPOUNDS AND DEVELOPING NEW

PRODUCTS IS INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN. DRUG DISCOVERY AND DEVELOPMENT IS TIME-CONSUMING, EXPENSIVE AND UNPREDICTABLE. THE PROCESS FROM EARLY DISCOVERY OR DESIGN TO DEVELOPMENT TO REGULATORY APPROVAL CAN TAKE MANY YEARS. DRUG CANDIDATES CAN FAIL AT ANY

STAGE OF THE PROCESS. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE AS TO WHETHER OR WHEN WE WILL RECEIVE REGULATORY APPROVAL FOR NEW PRODUCTS OR FOR NEW INDICATIONS OR DOSAGE FORMS FOR EXISTING PRODUCTS. DECISIONS BY REGULATORY AUTHORITIES REGARDING LABELING,

INGREDIENTS AND OTHER MATTERS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE AVAILABILITY OR COMMERCIAL POTENTIAL OF OUR PRODUCTS. AS EXAMPLES, THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT OUR LATE STAGE PIPELINE PRODUCTS, SUCH AS TOFACITINIB, BOSUTINIB AND

ELIQUIS

(APIXABAN) FOR

PREVENTION OF STROKE IN PATIENTS WITH ATRIAL FIBRILLATION, WILL RECEIVE REGULATORY APPROVAL AND/OR BE COMMERCIALLY SUCCESSFUL OR THAT RECENTLY APPROVED PRODUCTS, SUCH AS

PREVNAR 13/PREVENAR 13

FOR USE IN ADULTS 50 YEARS OF AGE AND OLDER,

XALKORI

(CRIZOTINIB) AND

INLYTA

(AXITINIB) WILL BE APPROVED IN OTHER MARKETS AND/OR BE COMMERCIALLY SUCCESSFUL. THERE IS ALSO A RISK THAT WE MAY NOT ADEQUATELY ADDRESS EXISTING REGULATORY AGENCY FINDINGS CONCERNING THE ADEQUACY OF

OUR REGULATORY COMPLIANCE PROCESSES AND SYSTEMS OR IMPLEMENT SUSTAINABLE PROCESSES AND PROCEDURES TO MAINTAIN REGULATORY COMPLIANCE AND TO ADDRESS FUTURE REGULATORY AGENCY FINDINGS, SHOULD THEY OCCUR.

THERE ARE MANY CONSIDERATIONS THAT CAN AFFECT MARKETING OF OUR PRODUCTS AROUND THE WORLD. REGULATORY DELAYS, DELAYS IN OR THE INABILITY

TO SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETE OR ADEQUATELY DESIGN AND IMPLEMENT CLINICAL TRIALS, CLAIMS AND CONCERNS ABOUT SAFETY AND EFFICACY, NEW DISCOVERIES, PATENT DISPUTES AND CLAIMS ABOUT ADVERSE SIDE EFFECTS ARE A FEW OF THE FACTORS THAT CAN ADVERSELY AFFECT THE

REALIZATION OF RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT AND PRODUCT-RELATED, FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS. FURTHER, CLAIMS AND CONCERNS ABOUT SAFETY AND EFFICACY CAN RESULT IN A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON PRODUCT SALES, PRODUCT RECALLS OR WITHDRAWALS, AND/OR CONSUMER FRAUD,

PRODUCT LIABILITY AND OTHER LITIGATION AND CLAIMS. ALSO, INCREASING REGULATORY SCRUTINY OF DRUG SAFETY AND EFFICACY, WITH REGULATORY AUTHORITIES INCREASINGLY FOCUSED ON PRODUCT SAFETY AND THE RISK/BENEFIT PROFILE OF PRODUCTS AS THEY RELATE TO

ALREADY-APPROVED PRODUCTS, HAS RESULTED IN A MORE CHALLENGING, EXPENSIVE AND LENGTHY REGULATORY APPROVAL PROCESS DUE TO REQUESTS FOR, AMONG OTHER THINGS, ADDITIONAL CLINICAL TRIALS PRIOR TO GRANTING APPROVAL OR INCREASED POST-APPROVAL REQUIREMENTS,

SUCH AS RISK EVALUATION AND MITIGATION STRATEGIES (SEE

POST-APPROVAL DATA

BELOW).

30

POST-APPROVAL DATA

AS A CONDITION TO GRANTING MARKETING APPROVAL OF A PRODUCT, THE FDA MAY REQUIRE A COMPANY TO CONDUCT ADDITIONAL CLINICAL TRIALS. THE RESULTS GENERATED IN THESE PHASE IV TRIALS COULD RESULT IN LOSS OF

MARKETING APPROVAL, CHANGES IN PRODUCT LABELING, AND/OR NEW OR INCREASED CONCERNS ABOUT SIDE EFFECTS OR EFFICACY OF A PRODUCT. THE FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION AMENDMENTS ACT OF 2007 (THE FDAAA) GIVES THE FDA ENHANCED POST-MARKET AUTHORITY,

INCLUDING THE EXPLICIT AUTHORITY TO REQUIRE POST-MARKET STUDIES AND CLINICAL TRIALS, LABELING CHANGES BASED ON NEW SAFETY INFORMATION AND COMPLIANCE WITH FDA-APPROVED RISK EVALUATION AND MITIGATION STRATEGIES. THE FDAS EXERCISE OF ITS

AUTHORITY UNDER THE FDAAA COULD RESULT IN DELAYS OR INCREASED COSTS DURING PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT, CLINICAL TRIALS AND REGULATORY REVIEW, INCREASED COSTS TO COMPLY WITH ADDITIONAL POST-APPROVAL REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS AND POTENTIAL RESTRICTIONS ON

SALES OF APPROVED PRODUCTS. FOREIGN REGULATORY AGENCIES OFTEN HAVE SIMILAR AUTHORITY AND MAY IMPOSE COMPARABLE COSTS. POST-MARKETING STUDIES, WHETHER CONDUCTED BY US OR BY OTHERS AND WHETHER MANDATED BY REGULATORY AGENCIES OR VOLUNTARY, AND OTHER

EMERGING DATA ABOUT MARKETED PRODUCTS, SUCH AS ADVERSE EVENT REPORTS, MAY ALSO ADVERSELY AFFECT SALES OF OUR PRODUCTS. FURTHER, THE DISCOVERY OF SIGNIFICANT PROBLEMS WITH A PRODUCT SIMILAR TO ONE OF OUR PRODUCTS THAT IMPLICATE (OR ARE PERCEIVED TO

IMPLICATE) AN ENTIRE CLASS OF PRODUCTS COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON SALES OF THE AFFECTED PRODUCTS. ACCORDINGLY, NEW DATA ABOUT OUR PRODUCTS, OR PRODUCTS SIMILAR TO OUR PRODUCTS, COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS DUE TO REAL OR

PERCEIVED SIDE EFFECTS OR UNCERTAINTY REGARDING EFFICACY AND, IN SOME CASES, COULD RESULT IN PRODUCT WITHDRAWAL OR RECALL. FURTHERMORE, NEW DATA AND INFORMATION, INCLUDING INFORMATION ABOUT PRODUCT MISUSE, MAY LEAD GOVERNMENT AGENCIES, PROFESSIONAL

SOCIETIES, PRACTICE MANAGEMENT GROUPS OR ORGANIZATIONS INVOLVED WITH VARIOUS DISEASES TO PUBLISH GUIDELINES OR RECOMMENDATIONS RELATED TO THE USE OF OUR PRODUCTS OR THE USE OF RELATED THERAPIES OR PLACE RESTRICTIONS ON SALES. SUCH GUIDELINES OR

RECOMMENDATIONS MAY LEAD TO LOWER SALES OF OUR PRODUCTS.

PATENT PROTECTION

OUR LONG-TERM SUCCESS LARGELY DEPENDS ON OUR ABILITY TO MARKET TECHNOLOGICALLY COMPETITIVE PRODUCTS. IF WE FAIL TO OBTAIN AND MAINTAIN

ADEQUATE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY PROTECTION, WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO PREVENT THIRD PARTIES FROM USING OUR PROPRIETARY TECHNOLOGIES. OUR CURRENTLY PENDING OR FUTURE PATENT APPLICATIONS AND/OR EXTENSIONS MAY NOT RESULT IN ISSUED PATENTS OR BE APPROVED ON

A TIMELY BASIS OR AT ALL. IN ADDITION, OUR ISSUED PATENTS MAY NOT CONTAIN CLAIMS SUFFICIENTLY BROAD TO PROTECT US AGAINST THIRD PARTIES WITH SIMILAR TECHNOLOGIES OR PRODUCTS OR PROVIDE US WITH ANY COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE. THE SCOPE OF OUR PATENT

CLAIMS ALSO MAY VARY BETWEEN COUNTRIES, AS INDIVIDUAL COUNTRIES HAVE THEIR OWN PATENT LAWS, SOME OF WHICH CREATE LEGAL UNCERTAINTY OR UNPREDICTABILITY WITH RESPECT TO THE REQUIREMENTS AND STANDARDS FOR PATENT PROTECTION. OUR ABILITY TO ENFORCE OUR

PATENTS ALSO DEPENDS ON THE LAWS OF INDIVIDUAL COUNTRIES AND EACH COUNTRYS PRACTICE WITH RESPECT TO ENFORCEMENT OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS, AND THE EXTENT TO WHICH CERTAIN SOVEREIGNS MAY ENGAGE IN COMPULSORY LICENSING OF PHARMACEUTICAL

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AS A RESULT OF LOCAL POLITICAL PRESSURE. IN ADDITION, MECHANISMS EXIST IN MUCH OF THE WORLD PERMITTING SOME FORM OF CHALLENGE BY GENERIC DRUG MARKETERS TO OUR PATENTS PRIOR TO, OR IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING, THE EXPIRATION OF ANY

REGULATORY EXCLUSIVITY, AND GENERIC COMPANIES ARE INCREASINGLY EMPLOYING AGGRESSIVE STRATEGIES, SUCH AS AT RISK LAUNCHES TO CHALLENGE OUR PATENT RIGHTS.

OUR BUSINESS ALSO MAY RELY ON UNPATENTED PROPRIETARY TECHNOLOGY, KNOW-HOW AND TRADE SECRETS. IF THE CONFIDENTIALITY OF THIS INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY IS BREACHED, IT COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR BUSINESS.

BIOTECHNOLOGY PRODUCTS

THE ACA HAS CREATED A FRAMEWORK FOR THE APPROVAL OF BIOSIMILARS IN THE U.S. FOLLOWING THE EXPIRATION OF 12 YEARS OF EXCLUSIVITY FOR THE INNOVATOR BIOLOGIC, WITH A POTENTIAL SIX-MONTH PEDIATRIC EXTENSION.

SUCH BIOSIMILARS COULD REFERENCE BIOTECHNOLOGY PRODUCTS ALREADY APPROVED UNDER THE U.S. PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICE ACT. ADDITIONALLY, THE FDA HAS APPROVED A BIOSIMILAR RECOMBINANT HUMAN GROWTH HORMONE THAT REFERENCED OUR BIOTECHNOLOGY PRODUCT,

GENOTROPIN

, WHICH WAS APPROVED UNDER THE U.S. FEDERAL FOOD, DRUG, AND COSMETIC ACT. IN EUROPE, THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION HAS GRANTED MARKETING AUTHORIZATIONS FOR SEVERAL BIOSIMILARS PURSUANT TO A SET OF GENERAL

31

AND PRODUCT CLASS-SPECIFIC GUIDELINES FOR BIOSIMILAR APPROVALS ISSUED OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS, AND IN JAPAN, THE REGULATORY AUTHORITY HAS GRANTED MARKETING AUTHORIZATIONS FOR CERTAIN BIOSIMILARS,

INCLUDING SOMATROPIN (THE RECOMBINANT HUMAN GROWTH HORMONE IN OUR

GENOTROPIN

PRODUCT) PURSUANT TO A GUIDELINE FOR BIOSIMILAR APPROVALS ISSUED IN 2009. IF COMPETITORS ARE ABLE TO OBTAIN MARKETING APPROVAL FOR BIOSIMILARS REFERENCING OUR

BIOTECHNOLOGY PRODUCTS, OUR BIOTECHNOLOGY PRODUCTS MAY BECOME SUBJECT TO COMPETITION FROM BIOSIMILARS, WITH THE ATTENDANT COMPETITIVE PRESSURE. EXPIRATION OR SUCCESSFUL CHALLENGE OF APPLICABLE PATENT RIGHTS COULD GENERALLY TRIGGER THIS COMPETITION,

ASSUMING ANY RELEVANT EXCLUSIVITY PERIOD HAS EXPIRED. WE MAY FACE MORE LITIGATION WITH RESPECT TO THE VALIDITY AND/OR SCOPE OF PATENTS RELATING TO OUR BIOTECHNOLOGY PRODUCTS WITH SUBSTANTIAL REVENUE.

PFIZER IS DEVELOPING BIOSIMILAR MEDICINES. THE DEVELOPING PATHWAY FOR REGISTRATION AND APPROVAL OF BIOSIMILAR PRODUCTS IN THE U.S. COULD

DIMINISH THE VALUE OF INVESTMENTS IN BIOSIMILARS THAT PFIZER HAS MADE, AND MAY CONTINUE TO MAKE GOING FORWARD. OTHER RISKS INCLUDE THE POTENTIAL FOR STEEPER THAN ANTICIPATED PRICE EROSION DUE TO INCREASED COMPETITIVE INTENSITY, COUPLED WITH HIGH

COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH CLINICAL DEVELOPMENT, SECONDARY PATENTS OR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY CHALLENGES THAT MAY PRECLUDE TIMELY COMMERCIALIZATION, AND LOWER PRESCRIPTIONS OF BIOSIMILARS DUE TO CONCERNS OVER PROTEIN COMPARABILITY OVER INNOVATOR MEDICINES.

RESEARCH STUDIES

DECISIONS ABOUT RESEARCH STUDIES MADE EARLY IN THE DEVELOPMENT PROCESS OF A DRUG CANDIDATE CAN HAVE A SUBSTANTIAL IMPACT ON THE MARKETING STRATEGY AND PAYER REIMBURSEMENT POSSIBILITIES ONCE THE DRUG

RECEIVES APPROVAL. MORE DETAILED STUDIES MAY DEMONSTRATE ADDITIONAL BENEFITS THAT CAN HELP IN THE MARKETING AND PAYER REIMBURSEMENT PROCESS, BUT THEY CONSUME TIME AND RESOURCES AND CAN DELAY SUBMITTING THE DRUG CANDIDATE FOR INITIAL APPROVAL. WE TRY

TO PLAN CLINICAL TRIALS PRUDENTLY, BUT THERE IS NO GUARANTEE THAT A PROPER BALANCE OF SPEED AND TESTING WILL BE MADE IN EACH CASE. THE QUALITY OF OUR DECISIONS IN THIS AREA COULD AFFECT OUR FUTURE RESULTS.

FOREIGN EXCHANGE AND INTEREST RATE RISK

SIGNIFICANT PORTIONS OF OUR REVENUES AND EARNINGS, AS WELL AS OUR SUBSTANTIAL INTERNATIONAL NET ASSETS, ARE EXPOSED TO CHANGES IN FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES. 60% OF OUR TOTAL 2011 REVENUES WERE DERIVED FROM

INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS, INCLUDING 27% FROM THE EUROPE REGION AND 20% FROM THE JAPAN AND THE REST OF ASIA REGION. AS WE OPERATE IN MULTIPLE FOREIGN CURRENCIES, INCLUDING THE EURO, THE U.K. POUND, THE JAPANESE YEN, THE CANADIAN DOLLAR AND

APPROXIMATELY 100 OTHER CURRENCIES, CHANGES IN THOSE CURRENCIES RELATIVE TO THE U.S. DOLLAR WILL IMPACT OUR REVENUES AND EXPENSES. IF THE U.S. DOLLAR WEAKENS AGAINST A SPECIFIC FOREIGN CURRENCY, OUR REVENUES WILL INCREASE, HAVING A POSITIVE IMPACT,

AND OUR OVERALL EXPENSES WILL INCREASE, HAVING A NEGATIVE IMPACT, ON NET INCOME. LIKEWISE, IF THE U.S. DOLLAR STRENGTHENS AGAINST A SPECIFIC FOREIGN CURRENCY, OUR REVENUES WILL DECREASE, HAVING A NEGATIVE IMPACT, AND OUR OVERALL EXPENSES WILL

DECREASE, HAVING A POSITIVE IMPACT ON NET INCOME. THEREFORE, SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES CAN IMPACT OUR RESULTS AND OUR FINANCIAL GUIDANCE.

IN ADDITION, OUR INTEREST-BEARING INVESTMENTS, LOANS AND BORROWINGS ARE SUBJECT TO RISK FROM CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES. THESE RISKS AND THE MEASURES WE HAVE TAKEN TO HELP

CONTAIN THEM ARE DISCUSSED IN THE

FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT

SECTION OF THE MD&A IN OUR 2011 FINANCIAL REPORT. FOR ADDITIONAL DETAILS, SEE THE NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

 NOTE 7E. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS 

DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES

IN OUR 2011 FINANCIAL REPORT. THOSE SECTIONS OF OUR 2011 FINANCIAL REPORT ARE INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE.

NOTWITHSTANDING OUR EFFORTS TO FORESEE AND MITIGATE THE EFFECTS OF CHANGES IN FISCAL CIRCUMSTANCES, WE CANNOT PREDICT WITH CERTAINTY CHANGES IN CURRENCY AND INTEREST RATES, INFLATION OR OTHER RELATED

FACTORS AFFECTING OUR BUSINESSES.

RISKS AFFECTING INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS

OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS ALSO COULD BE AFFECTED BY CAPITAL AND EXCHANGE CONTROLS, EXPROPRIATION AND OTHER RESTRICTIVE GOVERNMENT

ACTIONS, CHANGES IN INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY LEGAL PROTECTIONS AND REMEDIES, TRADE REGULATIONS

32

AND PROCEDURES AND ACTIONS AFFECTING APPROVAL, PRODUCTION, PRICING, AND MARKETING OF, REIMBURSEMENT FOR AND ACCESS TO, OUR PRODUCTS, AS WELL AS BY POLITICAL UNREST, UNSTABLE GOVERNMENTS AND LEGAL

SYSTEMS AND INTER-GOVERNMENTAL DISPUTES. ANY OF THESE CHANGES COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS.

MANY EMERGING MARKETS HAVE

EXPERIENCED GROWTH RATES IN EXCESS OF THE WORLDS LARGEST MARKETS, LEADING TO AN INCREASED CONTRIBUTION TO THE INDUSTRYS GLOBAL PERFORMANCE. AS A RESULT, WE HAVE BEEN EMPLOYING STRATEGIES TO GROW IN EMERGING MARKETS. HOWEVER, THERE IS NO

ASSURANCE THAT OUR STRATEGIES IN EMERGING MARKETS WILL BE SUCCESSFUL OR THAT THESE COUNTRIES WILL CONTINUE TO SUSTAIN THESE GROWTH RATES. IN ADDITION, SOME EMERGING MARKET COUNTRIES MAY BE PARTICULARLY VULNERABLE TO PERIODS OF FINANCIAL INSTABILITY

OR SIGNIFICANT CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS OR MAY HAVE LIMITED RESOURCES FOR HEALTHCARE SPENDING, WHICH, AS DISCUSSED ABOVE, CAN ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS.

ANIMAL HEALTH

OUR ANIMAL HEALTH UNIT MAY BE IMPACTED BY CHALLENGING

GLOBAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, RESULTING IN HIGH UNEMPLOYMENT RATES AND TIGHT CREDIT CONDITIONS. A HIGH UNEMPLOYMENT RATE TYPICALLY RESULTS IN REDUCED TRAFFIC IN VETERINARY CLINICS, NEGATIVELY IMPACTING OUR COMPANION ANIMAL BUSINESS. TIGHT CREDIT

CONDITIONS LIMIT THE BORROWING POWER OF LIVESTOCK PRODUCERS, CAUSING SOME TO SWITCH TO LOWER-PRICED ALTERNATIVES. SEE

GLOBAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS

BELOW.

PFIZER NUTRITION

PFIZER NUTRITION MAY BE IMPACTED BY CHALLENGING GLOBAL

ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND THE RESULTING EFFECT ON CONSUMER SPENDING, BOTH IN DEVELOPED AND EMERGING MARKETS. THE NUTRITION BUSINESS MAY ALSO EXPERIENCE SIGNIFICANT FINANCIAL IMPACT ASSOCIATED WITH CHANGES IN NATIONAL, REGIONAL, AND INTERNATIONAL LAWS,

RULES AND GUIDELINES AND THEIR ENFORCEMENT. OUR INFANT AND YOUNG CHILD NUTRITION PRODUCTS ARE SUBJECT TO AN ARRAY OF RULES AND REGULATIONS ENFORCED BY LOCAL GOVERNMENT ENTITIES, AS WELL AS TREATIES, CONVENTIONS AND GUIDELINES FROM INTERNATIONAL

AUTHORITIES. CHANGES TO THESE REQUIREMENTS CAN SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT COSTS RELATING TO TAXES, TARIFFS, TRADE, LABELING, MARKETING, MANUFACTURING, AND THE OVERALL AVAILABILITY OF OUR PRODUCTS. SEE

GLOBAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS

BELOW.

CONSUMER HEALTHCARE

THE CONSUMER HEALTHCARE UNIT MAY BE IMPACTED BY ECONOMIC VOLATILITY AND GENERIC OR STORE BRAND COMPETITION AFFECTING CONSUMER SPENDING

PATTERNS AND MARKET SHARE GAINS OF COMPETITORS BRANDED PRODUCTS OR GENERIC STORE BRANDS. IN ADDITION, REGULATORY AND LEGISLATIVE OUTCOMES REGARDING THE SAFETY, EFFICACY OR UNINTENDED USES OF SPECIFIC INGREDIENTS IN OUR CONSUMER HEALTHCARE

PRODUCTS MAY REQUIRE WITHDRAWAL AND/OR REFORMULATION OF CERTAIN PRODUCTS (E.G. COUGH/COLD PRODUCTS). SEE

GLOBAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS

BELOW.

GLOBAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS

IN ADDITION TO INDUSTRY-SPECIFIC FACTORS, WE,

LIKE OTHER BUSINESSES, CONTINUE TO FACE THE EFFECTS OF THE CHALLENGING ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT, WHICH HAVE IMPACTED OUR BIOPHARMACEUTICAL OPERATIONS IN THE U.S. AND EUROPE, AFFECTING THE PERFORMANCE OF PRODUCTS SUCH AS

LIPITOR

,

CELEBREX

AND

LYRICA

. WE BELIEVE THAT PATIENTS EXPERIENCING THE EFFECTS OF THE CHALLENGING ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT, INCLUDING HIGH UNEMPLOYMENT LEVELS AND INCREASES IN CO-PAYS, SOMETIMES SWITCH TO GENERIC PRODUCTS, DELAY TREATMENTS, SKIP DOSES OR USE LESS

EFFECTIVE TREATMENTS TO REDUCE THEIR COSTS. CHALLENGING ECONOMIC CONDITIONS IN THE U.S. ALSO HAVE INCREASED THE NUMBER OF PATIENTS IN THE MEDICAID PROGRAM, UNDER WHICH SALES OF PHARMACEUTICALS ARE SUBJECT TO SUBSTANTIAL REBATES AND, IN MANY STATES,

TO FORMULARY RESTRICTIONS LIMITING ACCESS TO BRAND-NAME DRUGS, INCLUDING OURS. IN ADDITION, WE EXPERIENCED CONTINUED PRICING PRESSURE IN VARIOUS ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENTS AROUND THE WORLD, INCLUDING IN EUROPE AND IN A NUMBER OF EMERGING MARKETS,

RESULTING IN GOVERNMENT-MANDATED REDUCTIONS IN PRICES FOR CERTAIN BIOPHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS, AS WELL AS GOVERNMENT-IMPOSED ACCESS RESTRICTIONS IN CERTAIN COUNTRIES.

33

THE GLOBAL ECONOMIC DOWNTURN AND THE CHALLENGING GLOBAL ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT HAVE NOT HAD,

NOR DO WE ANTICIPATE THEY WILL HAVE, A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR LIQUIDITY. DUE TO OUR SIGNIFICANT OPERATING CASH FLOWS, FINANCIAL ASSETS, ACCESS TO CAPITAL MARKETS AND AVAILABLE LINES OF CREDIT AND REVOLVING CREDIT AGREEMENTS, WE CONTINUE TO BELIEVE

THAT WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO MEET OUR LIQUIDITY NEEDS FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. AS MARKET CONDITIONS CHANGE, WE CONTINUE TO MONITOR OUR LIQUIDITY POSITION. HOWEVER, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT OUR LIQUIDITY WILL NOT BE AFFECTED BY POSSIBLE

FUTURE CHANGES IN GLOBAL FINANCIAL MARKETS AND GLOBAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS.

OTHER POTENTIAL IMPACTS OF THESE CHALLENGING

ECONOMIC CONDITIONS INCLUDE DECLINING SALES; INCREASED COSTS; CHANGES IN FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES; A DECLINE IN THE VALUE OF, OR A LOWER RATE OF RETURN ON, OUR FINANCIAL ASSETS AND PENSION PLAN INVESTMENTS, WHICH MAY REQUIRE US TO INCREASE OUR PENSION

FUNDING OBLIGATIONS; ADVERSE GOVERNMENT ACTIONS; DELAYS OR FAILURES IN THE PERFORMANCE OF CUSTOMERS, SUPPLIERS, AND OTHER THIRD PARTIES ON WHOM WE MAY DEPEND FOR THE PERFORMANCE OF OUR BUSINESS; AND THE RISK THAT OUR ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS

MAY NOT BE ADEQUATE.

OUTSOURCING

OUTSOURCING TO THIRD PARTIES IN AREAS INCLUDING TRANSACTION PROCESSING, ACCOUNTING, INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY, MANUFACTURING, CLINICAL TRIAL EXECUTION, NON-CLINICAL RESEARCH, SAFETY SERVICES AND OTHER AREAS

COULD EXPOSE US TO SUB-OPTIMAL QUALITY, MISSED DEADLINES, SUPPLY DISRUPTIONS, NON-COMPLIANCE OR REPUTATIONAL HARM, ALL WITH POTENTIAL NEGATIVE IMPLICATIONS FOR OUR RESULTS. FOR EXAMPLE, WE ARE TRANSITIONING OUR CLINICAL TRIAL EXECUTION MODEL FROM

MULTIPLE FUNCTIONAL SERVICE PROVIDERS TO TWO STRATEGIC PARTNERS. ANY ISSUES WITH ONE OR BOTH OF THESE PARTNERS OR DURING THE TRANSITION COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR BUSINESS.

INTERACTIONS WITH HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONALS

RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES APPLY

WHERE WE PROVIDE SOMETHING OF VALUE TO A HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONAL AND/OR GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL, WHICH, IF FOUND TO BE IMPROPER, COULD POTENTIALLY RESULT IN GOVERNMENT ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS AND PENALTIES. THESE RISKS MAY INCREASE AS NON-U.S. JURISDICTIONS

ADOPT NEW ANTI-BRIBERY LAWS AND REGULATIONS.

DIFFICULTIES OF OUR WHOLESALE DISTRIBUTORS

IN 2011, OUR LARGEST WHOLESALE DISTRIBUTOR ACCOUNTED FOR APPROXIMATELY 13% OF OUR TOTAL REVENUE (AND 30% OF OUR TOTAL U.S. REVENUE), AND

OUR TOP THREE WHOLESALE DISTRIBUTORS ACCOUNTED FOR APPROXIMATELY 32% OF OUR TOTAL REVENUE (AND 77% OF OUR TOTAL U.S. REVENUE). IF ONE OF OUR SIGNIFICANT WHOLESALE DISTRIBUTORS ENCOUNTERS FINANCIAL OR OTHER DIFFICULTIES, SUCH DISTRIBUTOR MAY DECREASE

THE AMOUNT OF BUSINESS THAT IT DOES WITH US, AND WE MAY BE UNABLE TO COLLECT ALL THE AMOUNTS THAT THE DISTRIBUTOR OWES US ON A TIMELY BASIS OR AT ALL, WHICH COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

PRODUCT MANUFACTURING AND MARKETING RISKS

DIFFICULTIES OR DELAYS IN PRODUCT MANUFACTURING OR MARKETING COULD AFFECT FUTURE RESULTS THROUGH REGULATORY ACTIONS, SHUT-DOWNS, APPROVAL DELAYS, WITHDRAWALS, RECALLS, PENALTIES, SUPPLY DISRUPTIONS OR

SHORTAGES, REPUTATIONAL HARM, PRODUCT LIABILITY, UNANTICIPATED COSTS OR OTHERWISE. EXAMPLES OF SUCH DIFFICULTIES OR DELAYS INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO, THE INABILITY TO INCREASE PRODUCTION CAPACITY COMMENSURATE WITH DEMAND; THE FAILURE TO

PREDICT MARKET DEMAND FOR, OR TO GAIN MARKET ACCEPTANCE OF, APPROVED PRODUCTS; THE POSSIBILITY THAT THE SUPPLY OF INCOMING MATERIALS MAY BE DELAYED OR BECOME UNAVAILABLE AND THAT THE QUALITY OF INCOMING MATERIALS MAY BE SUBSTANDARD AND NOT DETECTED;

OR THAT WE MAY FAIL TO MAINTAIN APPROPRIATE QUALITY STANDARDS THROUGHOUT THE INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL SUPPLY NETWORK AND/OR COMPLY WITH CURRENT GOOD MANUFACTURING PRACTICES AND OTHER APPLICABLE REGULATIONS.

COUNTERFEIT PRODUCTS

A

COUNTERFEIT MEDICINE IS ONE THAT HAS BEEN DELIBERATELY AND FRAUDULENTLY MISLABELED AS TO ITS IDENTITY AND SOURCE. A COUNTERFEIT PFIZER MEDICINE, THEREFORE, IS ONE MANUFACTURED BY SOMEONE OTHER THAN PFIZER, BUT WHICH

34

APPEARS TO BE THE SAME AS AN AUTHENTIC PFIZER MEDICINE. COUNTERFEIT MEDICINES POSE A RISK TO PATIENT HEALTH AND SAFETY BECAUSE OF THE CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH THEY ARE MANUFACTURED  IN

UNREGULATED, UNLICENSED, UNINSPECTED AND OFTEN UNSANITARY SITES  AS WELL AS THE LACK OF REGULATION OF THEIR CONTENTS. FAILURE TO MITIGATE THE THREAT OF COUNTERFEIT MEDICINES COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR BUSINESS, BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, CAUSING

THE LOSS OF PATIENT CONFIDENCE IN THE PFIZER NAME AND IN THE INTEGRITY OF OUR MEDICINES.

COST AND EXPENSE CONTROL/UNUSUAL

EVENTS/INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND GOODWILL

GROWTH IN COSTS AND EXPENSES, CHANGES IN PRODUCT, SEGMENT AND GEOGRAPHIC MIX AND

THE IMPACT OF ACQUISITIONS, DIVESTITURES, RESTRUCTURINGS, PRODUCT WITHDRAWALS, RECALLS AND OTHER UNUSUAL EVENTS THAT COULD RESULT FROM EVOLVING BUSINESS STRATEGIES, EVALUATION OF ASSET REALIZATION AND ORGANIZATIONAL RESTRUCTURING COULD ADVERSELY

AFFECT FUTURE RESULTS. SUCH RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES INCLUDE, IN PARTICULAR, OUR ABILITY TO SUCCESSFULLY IMPLEMENT OUR PLANS, ANNOUNCED FEBRUARY 1, 2011, REGARDING OUR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT FUNCTION (SEE

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT INVESTMENT

ABOVE), AS WELL AS OUR ABILITY TO REALIZE THE PROJECTED BENEFITS OF OUR COST-REDUCTION AND PRODUCTIVITY INITIATIVES, INCLUDING THOSE RELATED TO OUR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT FUNCTION.

IN ADDITION, OUR CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET CONTAINS SIGNIFICANT AMOUNTS OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS, INCLUDING GOODWILL. FOR IPR&D ASSETS,

THE RISK OF FAILURE IS SIGNIFICANT, AND THERE CAN BE NO CERTAINTY THAT THESE ASSETS WILL ULTIMATELY YIELD SUCCESSFUL PRODUCTS. THE NATURE OF THE BIOPHARMACEUTICAL BUSINESS IS HIGH-RISK AND REQUIRES THAT WE INVEST IN A LARGE NUMBER OF PROJECTS IN AN

EFFORT TO ACHIEVE A SUCCESSFUL PORTFOLIO OF APPROVED PRODUCTS. OUR ABILITY TO REALIZE VALUE ON THESE SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS IS OFTEN CONTINGENT UPON, AMONG OTHER THINGS, REGULATORY APPROVALS AND MARKET ACCEPTANCE. AS SUCH, WE EXPECT THAT MANY OF

THESE IPR&D ASSETS WILL BECOME IMPAIRED AND BE WRITTEN OFF AT SOME TIME IN THE FUTURE.

FURTHER, AS DISCUSSED ABOVE IN

ITEM 1. BUSINESS

UNDER THE CAPTION

OPERATING SEGMENTS

, PFIZER USED TO REPORT ALL OF ITS BIOPHARMACEUTICAL BUSINESSES IN A SINGLE SEGMENT (BIOPHARMACEUTICAL) AND NOW REPORTS THESE BUSINESSES IN THREE OPERATING SEGMENTS (PRIMARY

CARE; SPECIALTY CARE AND ONCOLOGY; AND EMERGING MARKETS AND ESTABLISHED PRODUCTS). AS A RESULT OF THIS CHANGE, THE GOODWILL PREVIOUSLY ASSOCIATED WITH THE SINGLE BIOPHARMACEUTICAL OPERATING SEGMENT HAS BEEN ALLOCATED AMONG THE THREE NEW

BIOPHARMACEUTICAL OPERATING SEGMENTS. WHILE ALL REPORTING UNITS CAN CONFRONT EVENTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES THAT CAN LEAD TO IMPAIRMENTS (SUCH AS, AMONG OTHER THINGS, UNANTICIPATED COMPETITION, AN ADVERSE ACTION OR ASSESSMENT BY A REGULATOR, A SIGNIFICANT

ADVERSE CHANGE IN LEGAL MATTERS OR IN THE BUSINESS CLIMATE AND/OR A FAILURE TO REPLACE THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF PRODUCTS THAT LOSE EXCLUSIVITY), IN GENERAL, OUR INCREASED NUMBER OF BIOPHARMACEUTICAL REPORTING UNITS SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASES OUR RISK OF

GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT CHARGES AS SMALLER REPORTING UNITS ARE INHERENTLY LESS ABLE TO ABSORB NEGATIVE DEVELOPMENTS THAT MIGHT AFFECT CERTAIN OPERATING ASSETS BUT NOT OTHERS.

CHANGES IN LAWS AND ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

OUR FUTURE RESULTS COULD BE

ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY CHANGES IN LAWS AND REGULATIONS, INCLUDING CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING STANDARDS, TAXATION REQUIREMENTS (INCLUDING TAX-RATE CHANGES, NEW TAX LAWS AND REVISED TAX LAW AND REGULATORY INTERPRETATIONS INCLUDING CHANGES AFFECTING THE

TAXATION BY THE U.S. OF INCOME EARNED OUTSIDE THE U.S. THAT MAY RESULT FROM PENDING AND POSSIBLE FUTURE PROPOSALS), COMPETITION LAWS AND ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS IN THE U.S. AND OTHER COUNTRIES.

TERRORIST ACTIVITY

OUR FUTURE RESULTS COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY

CHANGES IN BUSINESS, POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, INCLUDING THE COST AND AVAILABILITY OF INSURANCE, DUE TO THE THREAT OF TERRORIST ACTIVITY IN THE U.S. AND OTHER PARTS OF THE WORLD AND RELATED U.S. MILITARY ACTION OVERSEAS.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

WE

AND CERTAIN OF OUR SUBSIDIARIES ARE INVOLVED IN VARIOUS PATENT, PRODUCT LIABILITY, CONSUMER, COMMERCIAL, SECURITIES, ANTITRUST, ENVIRONMENTAL, EMPLOYMENT AND TAX LITIGATIONS AND CLAIMS, GOVERNMENT INVESTIGATIONS AND

35

OTHER LEGAL PROCEEDINGS THAT ARISE FROM TIME TO TIME IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF OUR BUSINESS. LITIGATION IS INHERENTLY UNPREDICTABLE, AND EXCESSIVE VERDICTS DO OCCUR. ALTHOUGH WE BELIEVE WE HAVE

SUBSTANTIAL DEFENSES IN THESE MATTERS, WE COULD IN THE FUTURE INCUR JUDGMENTS, ENTER INTO SETTLEMENTS OF CLAIMS OR REVISE OUR EXPECTATIONS REGARDING THE OUTCOME OF CERTAIN MATTERS, AND SUCH DEVELOPMENTS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR CASH FLOWS IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH THE AMOUNTS ARE PAID OR ACCRUED.

OUR ACTIVITIES RELATING TO THE

SALE AND MARKETING AND THE PRICING OF OUR PRODUCTS ARE SUBJECT TO EXTENSIVE REGULATION UNDER THE U.S. FEDERAL FOOD, DRUG, AND COSMETIC ACT, THE MEDICAID DRUG REBATE PROGRAM, THE U.S. FOREIGN CORRUPT PRACTICES ACT AND OTHER FEDERAL AND STATE

STATUTES, INCLUDING ANTI-KICKBACK AND FALSE CLAIMS LAWS, AS WELL AS SIMILAR LAWS IN FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS. LIKE MANY COMPANIES IN OUR INDUSTRY, WE HAVE FROM TIME TO TIME RECEIVED INQUIRIES AND SUBPOENAS AND OTHER TYPES OF INFORMATION DEMANDS FROM

GOVERNMENT AUTHORITIES, AND BEEN SUBJECT TO CLAIMS AND OTHER ACTIONS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS ACTIVITIES BROUGHT BY GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORITIES, AS WELL AS BY CONSUMERS AND PRIVATE PAYERS. IN SOME INSTANCES, WE HAVE INCURRED SIGNIFICANT EXPENSE AND

OTHER ADVERSE CONSEQUENCES AS A RESULT OF THESE CLAIMS, ACTIONS AND INQUIRIES. FOR EXAMPLE, THESE CLAIMS, ACTIONS AND INQUIRIES MAY RELATE TO ALLEGED FAILURES TO ACCURATELY INTERPRET OR IDENTIFY OR PREVENT NON-COMPLIANCE WITH THE LAWS AND

REGULATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH THE DISSEMINATION OF PRODUCT INFORMATION (APPROVED AND UNAPPROVED), POTENTIALLY RESULTING IN GOVERNMENT ENFORCEMENT AND DAMAGE TO OUR REPUTATION.

PATENT CLAIMS INCLUDE CHALLENGES TO THE COVERAGE AND/OR VALIDITY OF OUR PATENTS ON VARIOUS PRODUCTS OR PROCESSES. ALTHOUGH WE BELIEVE WE HAVE SUBSTANTIAL DEFENSES TO THESE CHALLENGES WITH RESPECT TO ALL

OUR MATERIAL PATENTS, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE AS TO THE OUTCOME OF THESE MATTERS, AND A LOSS IN ANY OF THESE CASES COULD RESULT IN A LOSS OF PATENT PROTECTION FOR THE DRUG AT ISSUE, WHICH COULD LEAD TO A SIGNIFICANT LOSS OF SALES OF THAT DRUG AND

COULD MATERIALLY AFFECT FUTURE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES

WE EXPECT TO CONTINUE TO ENHANCE OUR IN-LINE PRODUCTS AND PRODUCT PIPELINE THROUGH ACQUISITIONS, LICENSING AND ALLIANCES. SEE THE

OVERVIEW OF OUR PERFORMANCE, OPERATING ENVIRONMENT, STRATEGY AND OUTLOOK  OUR BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT INITIATIVES

SECTION OF THE MD&A IN OUR 2011 FINANCIAL REPORT, WHICH IS INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE. HOWEVER, THESE ENHANCEMENT PLANS

ARE SUBJECT TO THE AVAILABILITY AND COST OF APPROPRIATE OPPORTUNITIES AND COMPETITION FROM OTHER PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES THAT ARE SEEKING SIMILAR OPPORTUNITIES AND OUR ABILITY TO SUCCESSFULLY IDENTIFY AND EXECUTE TRANSACTIONS.

INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY

WE RELY TO A LARGE EXTENT UPON SOPHISTICATED INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS AND INFRASTRUCTURE. THE SIZE AND COMPLEXITY OF OUR COMPUTER

SYSTEMS MAKE THEM POTENTIALLY VULNERABLE TO SERVICE INTERRUPTION, MALICIOUS INTRUSION AND RANDOM ATTACK. LIKEWISE, DATA PRIVACY OR SECURITY BREACHES BY EMPLOYEES AND OTHERS WITH PERMITTED ACCESS TO OUR SYSTEMS, INCLUDING IN SOME CASES THIRD-PARTY

SERVICE PROVIDERS TO WHICH WE MAY OUTSOURCE CERTAIN BUSINESS FUNCTIONS, MAY POSE A RISK THAT SENSITIVE DATA, INCLUDING INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY OR PERSONAL INFORMATION, MAY BE EXPOSED TO UNAUTHORIZED PERSONS OR TO THE PUBLIC. WHILE WE HAVE INVESTED

HEAVILY IN THE PROTECTION OF DATA AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT OUR EFFORTS WILL PREVENT SERVICE INTERRUPTIONS, OR IDENTIFY BREACHES IN OUR SYSTEMS, THAT COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS AND/OR RESULT IN THE LOSS OF

CRITICAL OR SENSITIVE INFORMATION, WHICH COULD RESULT IN FINANCIAL, LEGAL, BUSINESS OR REPUTATIONAL HARM TO US.

FAILURE TO REALIZE THE

ANTICIPATED BENEFITS OF STRATEGIC INITIATIVES AND ACQUISITIONS

OUR FUTURE RESULTS MAY BE AFFECTED BY (I) THE IMPACT

OF, AND OUR ABILITY TO SUCCESSFULLY EXECUTE, ANY STRATEGIC ALTERNATIVES WE DECIDE TO PURSUE FOR OUR ANIMAL HEALTH AND NUTRITION BUSINESSES, AS WELL AS ANY OTHER CORPORATE STRATEGIC INITIATIVES WE MAY PURSUE IN THE FUTURE, AND (II) OUR ABILITY

TO REALIZE THE PROJECTED BENEFITS OF OUR ACQUISITION OF KING PHARMACEUTICALS, INC., AS WELL AS ANY OTHER ACQUISITIONS WE MAY PURSUE IN THE FUTURE.
