RISK FACTORS

THE STATEMENTS IN THIS

SECTION DESCRIBE THE MAJOR RISKS TO OUR BUSINESS AND SHOULD BE CONSIDERED CAREFULLY. IN ADDITION, THESE STATEMENTS CONSTITUTE OUR CAUTIONARY STATEMENTS UNDER THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995.

OUR DISCLOSURE AND ANALYSIS IN THIS 2008 FORM 10-K AND IN OUR 2008 ANNUAL REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS CONTAIN SOME FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS THAT SET

14

TABLE OF CONTENTS

FORTH ANTICIPATED RESULTS BASED ON MANAGEMENTS PLANS AND ASSUMPTIONS. FROM TIME TO TIME, WE ALSO PROVIDE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS IN OTHER

MATERIALS WE RELEASE TO THE PUBLIC, AS WELL AS ORAL FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS. SUCH STATEMENTS GIVE OUR CURRENT EXPECTATIONS OR FORECASTS OF FUTURE EVENTS; THEY DO NOT RELATE STRICTLY TO HISTORICAL OR CURRENT FACTS. WE HAVE TRIED, WHEREVER

POSSIBLE, TO IDENTIFY SUCH STATEMENTS BY USING WORDS SUCH AS ANTICIPATE, ESTIMATE, EXPECT, PROJECT, INTEND, PLAN, BELIEVE, WILL, TARGET,

FORECAST AND SIMILAR EXPRESSIONS IN CONNECTION WITH ANY DISCUSSION OF FUTURE OPERATING OR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE OR BUSINESS PLANS OR PROSPECTS. IN PARTICULAR, THESE INCLUDE STATEMENTS RELATING TO FUTURE ACTIONS, BUSINESS PLANS AND

PROSPECTS, PROSPECTIVE PRODUCTS OR PRODUCT APPROVALS, FUTURE PERFORMANCE OR RESULTS OF CURRENT AND ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS, SALES EFFORTS, EXPENSES, INTEREST RATES, FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES, THE OUTCOME OF CONTINGENCIES, SUCH AS LEGAL PROCEEDINGS, AND

FINANCIAL RESULTS.

WE CANNOT GUARANTEE THAT ANY FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENT WILL BE REALIZED, ALTHOUGH WE BELIEVE WE HAVE BEEN

PRUDENT IN OUR PLANS AND ASSUMPTIONS. ACHIEVEMENT OF FUTURE RESULTS IS SUBJECT TO RISKS, UNCERTAINTIES AND POTENTIALLY INACCURATE ASSUMPTIONS. SHOULD KNOWN OR UNKNOWN RISKS OR UNCERTAINTIES MATERIALIZE, OR SHOULD UNDERLYING ASSUMPTIONS PROVE

INACCURATE, ACTUAL RESULTS COULD DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM PAST RESULTS AND THOSE ANTICIPATED, ESTIMATED OR PROJECTED. YOU SHOULD BEAR THIS IN MIND AS YOU CONSIDER FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS.

WE UNDERTAKE NO OBLIGATION TO PUBLICLY UPDATE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS, WHETHER AS A RESULT OF NEW INFORMATION, FUTURE EVENTS OR OTHERWISE. YOU ARE

ADVISED, HOWEVER, TO CONSULT ANY FURTHER DISCLOSURES WE MAKE ON RELATED SUBJECTS IN OUR 10-Q AND 8-K REPORTS TO THE SEC. ALSO NOTE THAT WE PROVIDE THE FOLLOWING CAUTIONARY DISCUSSION OF RISKS, UNCERTAINTIES AND POSSIBLY INACCURATE ASSUMPTIONS

RELEVANT TO OUR BUSINESSES. THESE ARE FACTORS THAT, INDIVIDUALLY OR IN THE AGGREGATE, MAY CAUSE OUR ACTUAL RESULTS TO DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM EXPECTED AND HISTORICAL RESULTS. WE NOTE THESE FACTORS FOR INVESTORS AS PERMITTED BY THE PRIVATE SECURITIES

LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995. YOU SHOULD UNDERSTAND THAT IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO PREDICT OR IDENTIFY ALL SUCH FACTORS. CONSEQUENTLY, YOU SHOULD NOT CONSIDER THE FOLLOWING TO BE A COMPLETE DISCUSSION OF ALL POTENTIAL RISKS OR UNCERTAINTIES.

GOVERNMENT REGULATION AND MANAGED CARE TRENDS

U.S.

AND FOREIGN GOVERNMENTAL REGULATIONS MANDATING PRICE CONTROLS AND LIMITATIONS ON PATIENT ACCESS TO OUR PRODUCTS IMPACT OUR BUSINESS, AND OUR FUTURE RESULTS COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY CHANGES IN SUCH REGULATIONS. IN THE U.S., MANY OF OUR

PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS ARE SUBJECT TO INCREASING PRICING PRESSURES. SUCH PRESSURES HAVE INCREASED AS THE RESULT OF THE 2003 MEDICARE MODERNIZATION ACT DUE TO THE ENHANCED PURCHASING POWER OF THE PRIVATE SECTOR PLANS THAT NEGOTIATE ON BEHALF OF

MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES. IN ADDITION, IF THE 2003 MEDICARE MODERNIZATION ACT WERE AMENDED TO IMPOSE DIRECT GOVERNMENTAL PRICE CONTROLS AND ACCESS RESTRICTIONS, IT WOULD HAVE A SIGNIFICANT ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR BUSINESS. IN ADDITION, MCOS, AS WELL AS

MEDICAID AND OTHER GOVERNMENT AGENCIES, CONTINUE TO SEEK PRICE DISCOUNTS. SOME STATES HAVE IMPLEMENTED AND OTHER STATES ARE CONSIDERING PRICE CONTROLS OR PATIENT-ACCESS CONSTRAINTS UNDER THE MEDICAID PROGRAM AND SOME STATES ARE CONSIDERING

PRICE-CONTROL REGIMES THAT WOULD APPLY TO BROADER SEGMENTS OF THEIR POPULATIONS THAT ARE NOT MEDICAID ELIGIBLE. OTHER MATTERS ALSO COULD BE THE SUBJECT OF U.S. FEDERAL OR STATE LEGISLATIVE OR REGULATORY ACTION THAT COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR

BUSINESS, INCLUDING CHANGES IN PATENT LAWS, THE IMPORTATION OF PRESCRIPTION DRUGS FROM OUTSIDE THE U.S. AT PRICES THAT ARE REGULATED BY THE GOVERNMENTS OF VARIOUS FOREIGN COUNTRIES, RESTRICTIONS ON U.S. DIRECT-TO-CONSUMER ADVERTISING OR LIMITATIONS

ON INTERACTIONS WITH HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONALS AND THE USE OF COMPARATIVE EFFECTIVENESS METHODOLOGIES THAT COULD BE IMPLEMENTED IN A MANNER THAT FOCUSES PRIMARILY ON THE COST DIFFERENCES AND MINIMIZES THE THERAPEUTIC DIFFERENCES AMONG PHARMACEUTICAL

PRODUCTS.

THE PROHIBITION ON THE USE OF FEDERAL FUNDS FOR REIMBURSEMENT OF ED MEDICATIONS BY THE MEDICAID PROGRAM, WHICH BECAME EFFECTIVE

JANUARY 1, 2006, AND THE SIMILAR FEDERAL FUNDING PROHIBITION FOR THE MEDICARE PART D PROGRAM, WHICH BECAME EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2007, HAS HAD AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS. ANY PROHIBITIONS ON THE USE OF FEDERAL FUNDS FOR REIMBURSEMENT

OF OTHER CLASSES OF DRUGS IN THE FUTURE MAY ALSO HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT.

WE ENCOUNTER SIMILAR REGULATORY AND LEGISLATIVE ISSUES IN MOST

OTHER COUNTRIES. IN EUROPE AND SOME OTHER INTERNATIONAL MARKETS, THE GOVERNMENT PROVIDES HEALTHCARE AT LOW DIRECT COST TO CONSUMERS AND

15

TABLE OF CONTENTS

REGULATES PHARMACEUTICAL PRICES OR PATIENT REIMBURSEMENT LEVELS TO CONTROL COSTS FOR THE GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED HEALTHCARE SYSTEM. THIS INTERNATIONAL PATCHWORK

OF PRICE REGULATION HAS LED TO DIFFERENT PRICES AND SOME THIRD-PARTY TRADE IN OUR PRODUCTS FROM MARKETS WITH LOWER PRICES. SUCH TRADE EXPLOITING PRICE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN COUNTRIES CAN UNDERMINE OUR SALES IN MARKETS WITH HIGHER PRICES. AS A RESULT,

IT IS EXPECTED THAT PRESSURES ON THE PRICING COMPONENT OF OPERATING RESULTS WILL CONTINUE.

GENERIC COMPETITION

COMPETITION FROM MANUFACTURERS OF GENERIC DRUGS IS A MAJOR CHALLENGE FOR US AROUND THE WORLD. UPON THE EXPIRATION OR LOSS OF PATENT PROTECTION FOR ONE OF

OUR PRODUCTS, OR UPON THE AT-RISK LAUNCH (DESPITE PENDING PATENT INFRINGEMENT LITIGATION AGAINST THE GENERIC PRODUCT) BY A GENERIC MANUFACTURER OF A GENERIC VERSION OF ONE OF OUR PRODUCTS, WE CAN LOSE THE MAJOR PORTION OF SALES OF THAT

PRODUCT IN A VERY SHORT PERIOD, WHICH CAN ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS. FOR EXAMPLE, THE U.S. BASIC PATENT FOR

CAMPTOSAR

EXPIRED IN FEBRUARY 2008.

ALSO, THE PATENTS COVERING SEVERAL OF OUR MOST IMPORTANT MEDICINES, INCLUDING

LIPITOR, CELEBREX, DETROL/DETROL LA,

AND

ARICEPT,

ARE BEING CHALLENGED BY GENERIC MANUFACTURERS. IN ADDITION, OUR

PATENT-PROTECTED PRODUCTS MAY FACE COMPETITION IN THE FORM OF GENERIC VERSIONS OF BRANDED PRODUCTS OF COMPETITORS THAT LOSE THEIR MARKET EXCLUSIVITY. FOR EXAMPLE,

LIPITOR

BEGAN TO FACE COMPETITION FROM GENERIC PRAVASTATIN (PRAVACHOL) AND

GENERIC SIMVASTATIN (ZOCOR) DURING 2006.

COMPETITIVE PRODUCTS

WE CANNOT PREDICT WITH ACCURACY THE TIMING OR IMPACT OF THE INTRODUCTION OF COMPETITIVE PRODUCTS OR THEIR POSSIBLE EFFECT ON OUR SALES. PRODUCTS THAT COMPETE WITH OUR DRUGS, INCLUDING SOME OF OUR BEST-SELLING

MEDICINES, ARE LAUNCHED FROM TIME TO TIME. LAUNCHES OF A NUMBER OF COMPETITIVE PRODUCTS HAVE OCCURRED IN RECENT YEARS, AND CERTAIN POTENTIALLY COMPETITIVE PRODUCTS ARE IN VARIOUS STAGES OF DEVELOPMENT, SOME OF WHICH HAVE BEEN FILED FOR APPROVAL WITH

THE FDA AND WITH REGULATORY AUTHORITIES IN OTHER COUNTRIES.

DEPENDENCE ON KEY IN-LINE AND NEW PRODUCTS

WE RECORDED DIRECT PRODUCT REVENUES OF MORE THAN $1 BILLION FOR EACH OF NINE PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS IN 2008.

LIPITOR, NORVASC, LYRICA, CELEBREX,

VIAGRA, DETROL/DETROL LA, XALATAN/XALACOM

,

GEODON

AND

ZYVOX.

THOSE PRODUCTS ACCOUNTED FOR 60% OF OUR TOTAL PHARMACEUTICAL REVENUES IN 2008.

LIPITOR

SALES IN 2008 WERE APPROXIMATELY $12.4 BILLION, ACCOUNTING FOR 28% OF OUR

TOTAL 2008 PHARMACEUTICAL REVENUES. IF THE OTHER PRODUCTS OR ANY OF OUR OTHER MAJOR PRODUCTS WERE TO BECOME SUBJECT TO PROBLEMS SUCH AS LOSS OF PATENT PROTECTION, CHANGES IN PRESCRIPTION GROWTH RATES, MATERIAL PRODUCT LIABILITY LITIGATION,

UNEXPECTED SIDE EFFECTS, REGULATORY PROCEEDINGS, PUBLICITY AFFECTING DOCTOR OR PATIENT CONFIDENCE OR PRESSURE FROM EXISTING COMPETITIVE PRODUCTS, CHANGES IN LABELING OR IF A NEW, MORE EFFECTIVE TREATMENT SHOULD BE INTRODUCED, THE ADVERSE IMPACT ON

OUR REVENUES COULD BE SIGNIFICANT. FOR EXAMPLE, U.S. REVENUES FOR

CHANTIX

DECLINED SIGNIFICANTLY IN 2008 COMPARED TO 2007 FOLLOWING CHANGES TO THE

CHANTIX

U.S. LABEL DURING 2008. AS NOTED, PATENTS COVERING SEVERAL OF OUR BEST-SELLING

MEDICINES HAVE RECENTLY EXPIRED OR WILL EXPIRE IN THE NEXT FEW YEARS, AND PATENTS COVERING A NUMBER OF OUR BEST-SELLING MEDICINES ARE THE SUBJECT OF PENDING LEGAL CHALLENGES. IN ADDITION, OUR REVENUES COULD BE SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACTED BY THE TIMING

AND RATE OF COMMERCIAL ACCEPTANCE OF KEY NEW PRODUCTS, INCLUDING

SELZENTRY/CELSENTRI

AND

TOVIAZ.

SPECIALTY PHARMACEUTICALS

SPECIALTY PHARMACEUTICALS REFER TO MEDICINES THAT TREAT RARE OR LIFE-THREATENING CONDITIONS THAT HAVE SMALLER PATIENT POPULATIONS, SUCH

AS CERTAIN TYPES OF CANCER, MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS AND HIV. THE GROWING AVAILABILITY AND USE OF INNOVATIVE SPECIALTY PHARMACEUTICALS, COMBINED WITH THEIR RELATIVE HIGHER COST AS COMPARED TO OTHER TYPES OF PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS, IS BEGINNING TO

GENERATE SIGNIFICANT PAYER INTEREST IN DEVELOPING COST CONTAINMENT STRATEGIES TARGETED TO THIS SECTOR. WHILE THE IMPACT ON PFIZER OF PAYERS EFFORTS TO CONTROL ACCESS AND PRICING OF SPECIALTY PHARMACEUTICALS HAS BEEN LIMITED TO DATE, THE

COMPANYS GROWING PORTFOLIO OF SPECIALTY PRODUCTS, COMBINED WITH THE INCREASING USE OF HEALTH TECHNOLOGY ASSESSMENT IN MARKETS AROUND THE WORLD AND THE DETERIORATING FINANCES OF GOVERNMENTS, MAY LEAD TO A MORE SIGNIFICANT ADVERSE BUSINESS

IMPACT IN THE FUTURE.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT INVESTMENT

THE DISCOVERY AND DEVELOPMENT OF NEW PRODUCTS AS WELL AS THE DEVELOPMENT OF ADDITIONAL

USES FOR EXISTING PRODUCTS ARE VERY IMPORTANT TO THE SUCCESS OF THE COMPANY. HOWEVER, BALANCING CURRENT GROWTH AND INVESTMENT FOR THE FUTURE REMAINS A MAJOR CHALLENGE. OUR ONGOING INVESTMENTS IN NEW PRODUCT INTRODUCTIONS AND IN RESEARCH AND

DEVELOPMENT FOR NEW PRODUCTS AND EXISTING PRODUCT EXTENSIONS COULD EXCEED CORRESPONDING SALES GROWTH. THIS COULD PRODUCE HIGHER COSTS WITHOUT A PROPORTIONAL INCREASE IN REVENUES.

DEVELOPMENT, REGULATORY APPROVAL AND MARKETING OF PRODUCTS

RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES APPLY

PARTICULARLY WITH RESPECT TO PRODUCT-RELATED, FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS. THE OUTCOME OF THE LENGTHY AND COMPLEX PROCESS OF IDENTIFYING NEW COMPOUNDS AND DEVELOPING NEW PRODUCTS IS INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE AS TO WHETHER OR

WHEN WE WILL RECEIVE REGULATORY APPROVAL FOR NEW PRODUCTS OR FOR NEW INDICATIONS OR DOSAGE FORMS FOR EXISTING PRODUCTS. DECISIONS BY REGULATORY AUTHORITIES REGARDING LABELING AND OTHER MATTERS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE AVAILABILITY OR COMMERCIAL

POTENTIAL OF OUR PRODUCTS. THERE ALSO ARE MANY CONSIDERATIONS THAT CAN AFFECT MARKETING OF PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS AROUND THE WORLD. REGULATORY DELAYS, THE INABILITY TO SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETE CLINICAL TRIALS, CLAIMS AND CONCERNS ABOUT SAFETY AND

EFFICACY, NEW DISCOVERIES, PATENT DISPUTES AND CLAIMS ABOUT ADVERSE SIDE EFFECTS ARE A FEW OF THE FACTORS THAT COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE REALIZATION OF RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT AND PRODUCT-RELATED, FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS.

RESEARCH STUDIES

DECISIONS ABOUT RESEARCH STUDIES

MADE EARLY IN THE DEVELOPMENT PROCESS OF A DRUG CANDIDATE CAN HAVE A SUBSTANTIAL IMPACT ON THE MARKETING STRATEGY ONCE THE DRUG RECEIVES APPROVAL. MORE DETAILED STUDIES MAY DEMONSTRATE ADDITIONAL BENEFITS THAT CAN HELP IN THE MARKETING, BUT THEY

CONSUME TIME AND RESOURCES AND CAN DELAY SUBMITTING THE DRUG CANDIDATE FOR INITIAL APPROVAL. WE TRY TO PLAN CLINICAL TRIALS PRUDENTLY, BUT THERE IS NO GUARANTEE THAT A PROPER BALANCE OF SPEED AND TESTING WILL BE MADE IN EACH CASE. THE QUALITY OF OUR

DECISIONS IN THIS AREA COULD AFFECT OUR FUTURE RESULTS.

INTEREST RATE AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK

58% OF OUR TOTAL 2008 REVENUES WAS DERIVED FROM INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS, INCLUDING 31% FROM THE EUROPE REGION AND 15% FROM THE JAPAN/ASIA REGION. THESE

INTERNATIONAL-BASED REVENUES, AS WELL AS OUR SUBSTANTIAL INTERNATIONAL NET ASSETS, EXPOSE OUR REVENUES AND EARNINGS TO FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE CHANGES. IN ADDITION, OUR INTEREST-BEARING INVESTMENTS, LOANS AND BORROWINGS ARE SUBJECT TO RISK

FROM CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES. THESE RISKS AND THE MEASURES WE HAVE TAKEN TO HELP CONTAIN THEM ARE DISCUSSED IN THE SECTION ENTITLED

FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT

IN OUR 2008 FINANCIAL REPORT. FOR ADDITIONAL DETAILS,

SEE NOTE 9D TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS,

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS: DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES,

IN OUR 2008 FINANCIAL REPORT. THOSE SECTIONS OF OUR 2008 FINANCIAL REPORT ARE INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE.

NOTWITHSTANDING OUR EFFORTS TO FORESEE AND MITIGATE THE EFFECTS OF CHANGES IN FISCAL CIRCUMSTANCES, WE CANNOT PREDICT WITH CERTAINTY

CHANGES IN CURRENCY AND INTEREST RATES, INFLATION OR OTHER RELATED FACTORS AFFECTING OUR BUSINESSES.

RISKS AFFECTING INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS

OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS ALSO COULD BE AFFECTED BY CHANGES IN INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY LEGAL PROTECTIONS AND REMEDIES, TRADE

REGULATIONS AND PROCEDURES AND ACTIONS AFFECTING APPROVAL, PRODUCTION, PRICING, REIMBURSEMENT AND MARKETING OF PRODUCTS, AS WELL AS BY UNSTABLE GOVERNMENTS AND LEGAL SYSTEMS AND INTER-GOVERNMENTAL DISPUTES. ANY OF THESE CHANGES COULD ADVERSELY

AFFECT OUR BUSINESS.

GLOBAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS

THE RECENT CHANGES IN GLOBAL FINANCIAL MARKETS HAVE NOT HAD, NOR DO WE ANTICIPATE THEY WILL HAVE, A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON OUR LIQUIDITY. DUE TO OUR SIGNIFICANT OPERATING CASH FLOW, FINANCIAL ASSETS, ACCESS TO CAPITAL

MARKETS AND AVAILABLE LINES OF CREDIT AND REVOLVING CREDIT AGREEMENTS, WE CONTINUE TO BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO MEET OUR FINANCING NEEDS FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. AS MARKET CONDITIONS CHANGE, WE WILL CONTINUE TO MONITOR OUR LIQUIDITY

POSITION. HOWEVER, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT OUR LIQUIDITY OR OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS WILL NOT BE AFFECTED BY RECENT AND POSSIBLE FUTURE CHANGES IN GLOBAL FINANCIAL MARKETS AND GLOBAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS.

17

TABLE OF CONTENTS

MOREOVER, LIKE OTHER BUSINESSES, WE FACE THE POTENTIAL EFFECTS OF THE GLOBAL ECONOMIC RECESSION. UNPRECEDENTED MARKET CONDITIONS INCLUDING ILLIQUID CREDIT

MARKETS, VOLATILE EQUITY MARKETS, DRAMATIC FLUCTUATIONS IN FOREIGN CURRENCY RATES AND ECONOMIC RECESSION COULD AFFECT FUTURE RESULTS.

PRODUCT

MANUFACTURING AND MARKETING RISKS

DIFFICULTIES OR DELAYS IN PRODUCT MANUFACTURING OR MARKETING, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE

INABILITY TO INCREASE PRODUCTION CAPACITY COMMENSURATE WITH DEMAND OR THE FAILURE TO PREDICT MARKET DEMAND FOR, OR TO GAIN MARKET ACCEPTANCE OF, APPROVED PRODUCTS, COULD AFFECT FUTURE RESULTS.

COST AND EXPENSE CONTROL/UNUSUAL EVENTS

GROWTH IN

COSTS AND EXPENSES, CHANGES IN PRODUCT, SEGMENT AND GEOGRAPHIC MIX AND THE IMPACT OF ACQUISITIONS, DIVESTITURES, RESTRUCTURINGS, PRODUCT WITHDRAWALS AND OTHER UNUSUAL EVENTS THAT COULD RESULT FROM EVOLVING BUSINESS STRATEGIES, EVALUATION OF ASSET

REALIZATION AND ORGANIZATIONAL RESTRUCTURING COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT FUTURE RESULTS. SUCH RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES INCLUDE, IN PARTICULAR, OUR ABILITY TO REALIZE THE PROJECTED BENEFITS OF OUR COST-REDUCTION INITIATIVES.

CHANGES IN LAWS AND ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

OUR FUTURE

RESULTS COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY CHANGES IN LAWS AND REGULATIONS, INCLUDING CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING STANDARDS, TAXATION REQUIREMENTS (INCLUDING TAX-RATE CHANGES, NEW TAX LAWS AND REVISED TAX LAW INTERPRETATIONS), COMPETITION LAWS AND

ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS IN THE U.S. AND OTHER COUNTRIES.

TERRORIST ACTIVITY

OUR FUTURE RESULTS COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY CHANGES IN BUSINESS, POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, INCLUDING THE COST AND AVAILABILITY OF

INSURANCE, DUE TO THE THREAT OF TERRORIST ACTIVITY IN THE U.S. AND OTHER PARTS OF THE WORLD AND RELATED U.S. MILITARY ACTION OVERSEAS.

LEGAL

PROCEEDINGS

WE AND CERTAIN OF OUR SUBSIDIARIES ARE INVOLVED IN VARIOUS PATENT, PRODUCT LIABILITY, CONSUMER, COMMERCIAL, SECURITIES,

ENVIRONMENTAL AND TAX

LITIGATIONS AND CLAIMS, GOVERNMENT INVESTIGATIONS, AND OTHER LEGAL PROCEEDINGS THAT ARISE FROM TIME TO TIME IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF OUR BUSINESS.

LITIGATION IS INHERENTLY UNPREDICTABLE, AND EXCESSIVE VERDICTS DO OCCUR. ALTHOUGH WE BELIEVE WE HAVE SUBSTANTIAL DEFENSES IN THESE MATTERS, WE COULD IN THE FUTURE INCUR JUDGMENTS OR ENTER INTO SETTLEMENTS OF CLAIMS THAT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE

EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN ANY PARTICULAR PERIOD.

PATENT CLAIMS INCLUDE CHALLENGES TO THE COVERAGE AND/OR VALIDITY OF OUR

PATENTS ON VARIOUS PRODUCTS OR PROCESSES. ALTHOUGH WE BELIEVE WE HAVE SUBSTANTIAL DEFENSES TO THESE CHALLENGES WITH RESPECT TO ALL OUR MATERIAL PATENTS, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE AS TO THE OUTCOME OF THESE MATTERS, AND A LOSS IN ANY OF THESE CASES

COULD RESULT IN A LOSS OF PATENT PROTECTION FOR THE DRUG AT ISSUE, WHICH COULD LEAD TO A SIGNIFICANT LOSS OF SALES OF THAT DRUG AND COULD MATERIALLY AFFECT FUTURE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES

WE PLAN TO CONTINUE TO ENHANCE OUR IN-LINE PRODUCTS AND PRODUCT

PIPELINE THROUGH ACQUISITIONS, LICENSING AND ALLIANCES (SEE

REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT AND PIPELINE PRODUCTIVITY

UNDER

OUR OPERATING ENVIRONMENT AND RESPONSE TO KEY OPPORTUNITIES AND CHALLENGES

IN OUR 2008 FINANCIAL REPORT, WHICH IS

INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE). HOWEVER, THESE ENHANCEMENT PLANS ARE SUBJECT TO THE AVAILABILITY AND COST OF APPROPRIATE OPPORTUNITIES AND COMPETITION FROM OTHER PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES THAT ARE SEEKING SIMILAR OPPORTUNITIES.

INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY

WE RELY TO A LARGE EXTENT

UPON SOPHISTICATED INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS AND INFRASTRUCTURE. THE SIZE AND COMPLEXITY OF OUR COMPUTER SYSTEMS MAKE THEM POTENTIALLY VULNERABLE TO BREAKDOWN, MALICIOUS INTRUSION AND RANDOM ATTACK. LIKEWISE, DATA PRIVACY BREACHES BY EMPLOYEES

AND OTHERS WITH PERMITTED ACCESS TO OUR SYSTEMS MAY POSE A RISK THAT SENSITIVE DATA MAY BE EXPOSED TO UNAUTHORIZED PERSONS OR TO THE PUBLIC. WHILE WE HAVE INVESTED HEAVILY IN PROTECTION OF DATA AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE

THAT OUR EFFORTS WILL PREVENT BREAKDOWNS OR BREACHES IN OUR SYSTEMS THAT COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

RISK FACTORS RELATED TO THE PROPOSED WYETH ACQUISITION

WE MAY FAIL TO REALIZE ALL OF THE ANTICIPATED BENEFITS OF THE ACQUISITION.

THE SUCCESS OF THE ACQUISITION WILL DEPEND, IN PART, ON OUR ABILITY TO REALIZE THE ANTICIPATED BENEFITS AND COST SAVINGS FROM

COMBINING THE BUSINESSES OF PFIZER AND WYETH. HOWEVER, TO REALIZE THESE ANTICIPATED BENEFITS AND COST SAVINGS, WE MUST SUCCESSFULLY COMBINE THE BUSINESSES OF PFIZER AND WYETH. IF WE ARE NOT ABLE TO ACHIEVE THESE OBJECTIVES, THE ANTICIPATED BENEFITS

AND COST SAVINGS OF THE ACQUISITION MAY NOT BE REALIZED FULLY OR AT ALL OR MAY TAKE LONGER TO REALIZE THAN EXPECTED.

PFIZER AND WYETH HAVE

OPERATED AND, UNTIL THE COMPLETION OF THE ACQUISITION, WILL CONTINUE TO OPERATE, INDEPENDENTLY. IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE INTEGRATION PROCESS COULD RESULT IN THE LOSS OF KEY EMPLOYEES, THE DISRUPTION OF EACH COMPANYS ONGOING BUSINESSES OR

INCONSISTENCIES IN STANDARDS, CONTROLS, PROCEDURES AND POLICIES THAT ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO MAINTAIN RELATIONSHIPS WITH CUSTOMERS, SUPPLIERS, DISTRIBUTORS, CREDITORS, LESSORS, CLINICAL TRIAL INVESTIGATORS OR MANAGERS OF ITS CLINICAL TRIALS

OR TO ACHIEVE THE ANTICIPATED BENEFITS OF THE ACQUISITION. INTEGRATION EFFORTS BETWEEN THE TWO COMPANIES WILL ALSO DIVERT MANAGEMENT ATTENTION AND RESOURCES. THESE INTEGRATION MATTERS COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON EACH OF WYETH AND PFIZER DURING

SUCH TRANSITION PERIOD.

FAILURE TO COMPLETE THE ACQUISITION COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR STOCK PRICE AND OUR FUTURE BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL RESULTS .

IF THE ACQUISITION IS NOT COMPLETED OR OUR FINANCING FOR THE TRANSACTION BECOMES UNAVAILABLE, OUR ONGOING BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL

RESULTS MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED AND WE WILL BE SUBJECT TO A NUMBER OF RISKS, INCLUDING THE FOLLOWING.



IF OUR FINANCING FOR THE ACQUISITION BECOMES UNAVAILABLE, WE WILL, UNDER CIRCUMSTANCES SPECIFIED IN THE MERGER AGREEMENT, BE REQUIRED TO PAY SIGNIFICANT LIQUIDATED

DAMAGES TO WYETH OR BE COMPELLED TO TAKE CERTAIN ACTIONS TO SPECIFICALLY PERFORM OUR OBLIGATION TO CONSUMMATE THE ACQUISITION;



WE WILL BE REQUIRED TO PAY CERTAIN COSTS RELATING TO THE ACQUISITION, WHETHER OR NOT THE ACQUISITION IS COMPLETED;



MATTERS RELATING TO THE ACQUISITION (INCLUDING INTEGRATION PLANNING) MAY REQUIRE SUBSTANTIAL COMMITMENTS OF TIME AND RESOURCES BY OUR MANAGEMENT, WHICH COULD

OTHERWISE HAVE BEEN DEVOTED TO OTHER OPPORTUNITIES THAT MAY HAVE BEEN BENEFICIAL TO US.

WE COULD ALSO BE SUBJECT TO

LITIGATION RELATED TO ANY FAILURE TO COMPLETE THE ACQUISITION. IF THE ACQUISITION IS NOT COMPLETED, THESE RISKS MAY MATERIALIZE AND MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL RESULTS AND STOCK PRICE.

THE REQUIRED REGULATORY APPROVALS MAY NOT BE OBTAINED OR MAY CONTAIN MATERIALLY BURDENSOME CONDITIONS THAT COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON US.

COMPLETION OF THE ACQUISITION IS CONDITIONED UPON THE RECEIPT OF CERTAIN GOVERNMENTAL APPROVALS, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE EXPIRATION OR

TERMINATION OF THE APPLICABLE WAITING PERIOD UNDER THE HART-SCOTT-RODINO ACT, THE ISSUANCE BY THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION OF A DECISION UNDER THE EC MERGER REGULATION DECLARING THE ACQUISITION COMPATIBLE WITH THE COMMON MARKET, THE APPROVAL OF THE

ACQUISITION UNDER THE CHINA ANTI-MONOPOLY LAW AND THE APPROVAL OF THE ACQUISITION BY THE ANTITRUST REGULATORS IN CANADA AND AUSTRALIA. ALTHOUGH PFIZER AND WYETH HAVE AGREED IN THE MERGER AGREEMENT TO USE THEIR REASONABLE BEST EFFORTS TO OBTAIN THE

REQUISITE GOVERNMENTAL APPROVALS, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THESE APPROVALS WILL BE OBTAINED. IN ADDITION, THE GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORITIES FROM WHICH THESE APPROVALS ARE REQUIRED MAY IMPOSE CONDITIONS ON THE COMPLETION OF THE ACQUISITION OR

REQUIRE CHANGES TO THE TERMS OF THE ACQUISITION. UNDER THE TERMS OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT, WE ARE REQUIRED, IF NECESSARY TO RECEIVE ANTITRUST APPROVAL, TO MAKE DIVESTITURES OF ASSETS SO LONG AS SUCH DIVESTITURES WOULD NOT RESULT IN THE ONE-YEAR LOSS

OF NET SALES (MEASURED BY NET 2008 SALES REVENUE) IN EXCESS OF $3 BILLION. IF WE BECOME SUBJECT TO ANY MATERIAL CONDITIONS IN ORDER TO OBTAIN ANY APPROVALS REQUIRED TO COMPLETE THE ACQUISITION, OUR BUSINESS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS MAY BE ADVERSELY

AFFECTED.

WE WILL TAKE ON SUBSTANTIAL ADDITIONAL INDEBTEDNESS TO FINANCE THE ACQUISITION.

UPON COMPLETION OF THE ACQUISITION, WE WILL INCREASE OUR INDEBTEDNESS WHICH WILL INCLUDE ACQUISITION DEBT FINANCING OF APPROXIMATELY $22.5 BILLION AND THE

ASSUMPTION OF WYETHS DEBT

19

TABLE OF CONTENTS

OBLIGATIONS. THE FINANCIAL AND OTHER COVENANTS THAT WE AGREE TO IN CONNECTION WITH SUCH INDEBTEDNESS AND OUR INCREASED INDEBTEDNESS AND HIGHER DEBT-TO-EQUITY

RATIO IN COMPARISON TO THAT OF PFIZER ON A RECENT HISTORICAL BASIS COULD, AMONG OTHER THINGS, REDUCE OUR FLEXIBILITY TO RESPOND TO CHANGING BUSINESS AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND INCREASE OUR BORROWING COSTS.

WE WILL INCUR SIGNIFICANT TRANSACTION AND ACQUISITION-RELATED COSTS IN CONNECTION WITH THE ACQUISITION.

WE EXPECT TO INCUR A NUMBER OF NON-RECURRING COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH INTEGRATING THE OPERATIONS OF WYETH. THE SUBSTANTIAL MAJORITY OF NON-RECURRING EXPENSES

RESULTING FROM THE ACQUISITION WILL BE COMPRISED OF TRANSACTION COSTS RELATED TO THE ACQUISITION, FACILITIES AND SYSTEMS CONSOLIDATION COSTS AND EMPLOYMENTRELATED COSTS. WE WILL ALSO INCUR TRANSACTION FEES AND COSTS RELATED TO FORMULATING

INTEGRATION PLANS. ADDITIONAL UNANTICIPATED COSTS MAY BE INCURRED IN THE INTEGRATION OF WYETHS BUSINESS. ALTHOUGH WE EXPECT THAT THE ELIMINATION OF DUPLICATIVE COSTS, AS WELL AS THE REALIZATION OF OTHER EFFICIENCIES RELATED TO THE INTEGRATION

OF THE BUSINESSES, SHOULD ALLOW US TO MORE THAN OFFSET INCREMENTAL TRANSACTION AND ACQUISITION-RELATED COSTS OVER TIME, THIS NET BENEFIT MAY NOT BE ACHIEVED IN THE NEAR TERM, OR AT ALL.

THE MERGER MAY NOT BE ACCRETIVE AND MAY CAUSE DILUTION TO OUR EARNINGS PER SHARE, WHICH MAY HARM THE MARKET PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK.

WE CURRENTLY ANTICIPATE THAT THE MERGER WILL BE ACCRETIVE TO EARNINGS PER SHARE DURING THE CALENDAR YEAR 2011. THIS EXPECTATION IS BASED ON PRELIMINARY

ESTIMATES WHICH MAY MATERIALLY CHANGE AFTER THE COMPLETION OF THE MERGER. WE COULD ALSO ENCOUNTER ADDITIONAL TRANSACTION AND INTEGRATION-RELATED COSTS OR OTHER FACTORS SUCH AS THE FAILURE TO REALIZE ALL OF THE BENEFITS ANTICIPATED IN THE MERGER. ALL

OF THESE FACTORS COULD CAUSE DILUTION TO OUR EARNINGS PER SHARE OR DECREASE OR DELAY THE EXPECTED ACCRETIVE EFFECT OF THE MERGER AND CAUSE A DECREASE IN THE PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK.

CHARGES TO EARNINGS

RESULTING FROM THE APPLICATION OF THE PURCHASE METHOD OF ACCOUNTING MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE MARKET VALUE OF OUR COMMON STOCK FOLLOWING THE MERGER.

IN ACCORDANCE WITH U.S. GAAP, WE WILL BE CONSIDERED THE ACQUIRER FOR ACCOUNTING PURPOSES. WE WILL ACCOUNT FOR THE MERGER USING THE PURCHASE METHOD OF ACCOUNTING, WHICH WILL RESULT IN CHARGES TO OUR EARNINGS THAT COULD

ADVERSELY AFFECT THE MARKET VALUE OF OUR COMMON STOCK FOLLOWING THE COMPLETION OF THE MERGER. UNDER THE PURCHASE METHOD OF ACCOUNTING, WE WILL ALLOCATE THE TOTAL PURCHASE PRICE TO THE ASSETS ACQUIRED AND LIABILITIES ASSUMED FROM WYETH BASED ON THEIR

FAIR VALUES AS OF THE DATE OF THE COMPLETION OF THE MERGER, AND RECORD ANY EXCESS OF THE PURCHASE PRICE OVER THOSE FAIR VALUES AS GOODWILL. FOR CERTAIN TANGIBLE AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS, REEVALUATING THEIR FAIR VALUES AS OF THE COMPLETION DATE OF THE

MERGER WILL RESULT IN OUR INCURRING ADDITIONAL DEPRECIATION AND/OR AMORTIZATION EXPENSE THAT EXCEED THE COMBINED AMOUNTS RECORDED BY PFIZER AND WYETH PRIOR TO THE MERGER. THIS INCREASED EXPENSE WILL BE RECORDED BY US OVER THE USEFUL LIVES OF THE

UNDERLYING ASSETS. IN ADDITION, TO THE EXTENT THE VALUE OF GOODWILL OR INTANGIBLE ASSETS WERE TO BECOME IMPAIRED, WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO INCUR CHARGES RELATING TO THE IMPAIRMENT OF THOSE ASSETS.

WYETH FACES LITIGATION RISKS AND IS THE SUBJECT OF VARIOUS LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.

IF WE CONSUMMATE OUR ACQUISITION OF WYETH, WE WILL ASSUME WYETHS RISKS ARISING FROM LEGAL PROCEEDINGS. LIKE ALL PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES IN THE CURRENT LEGAL ENVIRONMENT, WYETH IS INVOLVED IN VARIOUS PATENT,

PRODUCT LIABILITY, CONSUMER, COMMERCIAL, SECURITIES, ENVIRONMENTAL AND TAX LITIGATIONS AND CLAIMS, GOVERNMENT INVESTIGATIONS, AND OTHER LEGAL PROCEEDINGS THAT ARISE FROM TIME TO TIME IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF ITS BUSINESS. WE CANNOT PREDICT WITH

CERTAINTY THE EVENTUAL OUTCOME OF WYETHS PENDING OR FUTURE LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND THE ULTIMATE OUTCOME OF SUCH MATTERS COULD BE MATERIAL TO OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, CASH FLOWS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.
