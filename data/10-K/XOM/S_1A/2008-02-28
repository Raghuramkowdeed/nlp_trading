ITEM 1A.

RISK FACTORS.

EXXONMOBILS FINANCIAL AND OPERATING RESULTS ARE SUBJECT TO A NUMBER OF FACTORS, MANY OF WHICH ARE NOT WITHIN THE COMPANYS CONTROL. THESE

FACTORS INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING.

INDUSTRY AND ECONOMIC

FACTORS.

THE OIL AND GAS BUSINESS IS FUNDAMENTALLY A COMMODITY BUSINESS. THIS MEANS THE OPERATIONS AND EARNINGS OF THE CORPORATION AND ITS AFFILIATES THROUGHOUT THE WORLD MAY BE SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTED BY CHANGES IN OIL,

GAS AND PETROCHEMICAL PRICES AND BY CHANGES IN MARGINS ON GASOLINE AND OTHER REFINED PRODUCTS. OIL, GAS, PETROCHEMICAL AND PRODUCT PRICES AND MARGINS IN TURN DEPEND ON LOCAL, REGIONAL AND GLOBAL EVENTS OR CONDITIONS THAT AFFECT SUPPLY AND DEMAND FOR

THE RELEVANT COMMODITY. THESE EVENTS OR CONDITIONS ARE GENERALLY NOT PREDICTABLE AND INCLUDE, AMONG OTHER THINGS.



GENERAL ECONOMIC GROWTH RATES AND THE OCCURRENCE OF ECONOMIC RECESSIONS;



THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW SUPPLY SOURCES;



ADHERENCE BY COUNTRIES TO OPEC QUOTAS;



SUPPLY DISRUPTIONS;



WEATHER, INCLUDING SEASONAL PATTERNS THAT AFFECT REGIONAL ENERGY DEMAND (SUCH AS THE DEMAND FOR HEATING OIL OR GAS IN WINTER) AS WELL AS SEVERE WEATHER EVENTS (SUCH

AS HURRICANES) THAT CAN DISRUPT SUPPLIES OR INTERRUPT THE OPERATION OF EXXONMOBIL FACILITIES;



TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES, INCLUDING ADVANCES IN EXPLORATION, PRODUCTION, REFINING AND PETROCHEMICAL MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY AND ADVANCES IN TECHNOLOGY RELATING TO

ENERGY USAGE;



CHANGES IN DEMOGRAPHICS, INCLUDING POPULATION GROWTH RATES AND CONSUMER PREFERENCES; AND



THE COMPETITIVENESS OF ALTERNATIVE HYDROCARBON OR OTHER ENERGY SOURCES.

UNDER CERTAIN MARKET CONDITIONS, FACTORS THAT HAVE A POSITIVE IMPACT ON ONE SEGMENT OF OUR BUSINESS MAY HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON ANOTHER

SEGMENT AND VICE VERSA.

COMPETITIVE

FACTORS.

THE ENERGY AND PETROCHEMICAL INDUSTRIES ARE HIGHLY COMPETITIVE. THERE IS COMPETITION WITHIN THE INDUSTRIES AND ALSO WITH OTHER INDUSTRIES IN SUPPLYING THE ENERGY, FUEL AND CHEMICAL NEEDS OF BOTH INDUSTRIAL AND

INDIVIDUAL CONSUMERS. THE CORPORATION COMPETES WITH OTHER FIRMS IN THE SALE OR PURCHASE OF NEEDED GOODS AND SERVICES IN MANY NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL MARKETS AND EMPLOYS ALL METHODS OF COMPETITION WHICH ARE LAWFUL AND APPROPRIATE FOR SUCH

PURPOSES.

A KEY COMPONENT OF THE CORPORATIONS

COMPETITIVE POSITION, PARTICULARLY GIVEN THE COMMODITY-BASED NATURE OF MANY OF ITS BUSINESSES, IS EXXONMOBILS ABILITY TO MANAGE EXPENSES SUCCESSFULLY. THIS REQUIRES CONTINUOUS MANAGEMENT FOCUS ON REDUCING UNIT COSTS AND IMPROVING EFFICIENCY

INCLUDING THROUGH TECHNOLOGY IMPROVEMENTS, COST CONTROL, PRODUCTIVITY ENHANCEMENTS AND REGULAR REAPPRAISAL OF OUR ASSET PORTFOLIO AS DESCRIBED ELSEWHERE IN THIS REPORT.

POLITICAL AND LEGAL FACTORS.

THE OPERATIONS AND EARNINGS OF THE CORPORATION AND ITS AFFILIATES THROUGHOUT THE

WORLD HAVE BEEN, AND MAY IN THE FUTURE BE, AFFECTED FROM TIME TO TIME IN VARYING DEGREE BY POLITICAL AND LEGAL FACTORS INCLUDING.



POLITICAL INSTABILITY OR LACK OF WELL-ESTABLISHED AND RELIABLE LEGAL SYSTEMS IN AREAS WHERE THE CORPORATION OPERATES;

OTHER POLITICAL DEVELOPMENTS AND LAWS AND REGULATIONS, SUCH AS EXPROPRIATION OR FORCED DIVESTITURE OF ASSETS, UNILATERAL CANCELLATION OR MODIFICATION OF CONTRACT

TERMS, AND REGULATION OF CERTAIN ENERGY MARKETS;



LAWS AND REGULATIONS RELATED TO ENVIRONMENTAL OR ENERGY SECURITY MATTERS, INCLUDING THOSE ADDRESSING ALTERNATIVE ENERGY SOURCES AND THE RISKS OF GLOBAL CLIMATE

CHANGE;



RESTRICTIONS ON EXPLORATION, PRODUCTION, IMPORTS AND EXPORTS;



RESTRICTIONS ON THE CORPORATIONS ABILITY TO DO BUSINESS WITH CERTAIN COUNTRIES, OR TO ENGAGE IN CERTAIN AREAS OF BUSINESS WITHIN A COUNTRY;



PRICE CONTROLS;



TAX OR ROYALTY INCREASES, INCLUDING RETROACTIVE CLAIMS;



WAR OR OTHER INTERNATIONAL CONFLICTS; AND



CIVIL UNREST.

BOTH THE LIKELIHOOD OF THESE OCCURRENCES AND THEIR OVERALL EFFECT UPON THE CORPORATION VARY GREATLY FROM COUNTRY TO COUNTRY AND ARE NOT PREDICTABLE. A KEY COMPONENT OF

THE CORPORATIONS STRATEGY FOR MANAGING POLITICAL RISK IS GEOGRAPHIC DIVERSIFICATION OF THE CORPORATIONS ASSETS AND OPERATIONS.

PROJECT FACTORS.

IN ADDITION TO SOME OF THE FACTORS CITED ABOVE, EXXONMOBILS RESULTS DEPEND UPON THE

CORPORATIONS ABILITY TO DEVELOP AND OPERATE MAJOR PROJECTS AND FACILITIES AS PLANNED. THE CORPORATIONS RESULTS WILL THEREFORE BE AFFECTED BY EVENTS OR CONDITIONS THAT IMPACT THE ADVANCEMENT, OPERATION, COST OR RESULTS OF SUCH PROJECTS OR

FACILITIES, INCLUDING.



THE OUTCOME OF NEGOTIATIONS WITH CO-VENTURERS, GOVERNMENTS, SUPPLIERS, CUSTOMERS OR OTHERS (INCLUDING, FOR EXAMPLE, OUR ABILITY TO NEGOTIATE FAVORABLE LONG-TERM

CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS, OR THE DEVELOPMENT OF RELIABLE SPOT MARKETS, THAT MAY BE NECESSARY TO SUPPORT THE DEVELOPMENT OF PARTICULAR PRODUCTION PROJECTS);



RESERVOIR PERFORMANCE AND NATURAL FIELD DECLINE;



CHANGES IN OPERATING CONDITIONS AND COSTS, INCLUDING COSTS OF THIRD PARTY EQUIPMENT OR SERVICES SUCH AS DRILLING RIGS AND SHIPPING;



SECURITY CONCERNS OR ACTS OF TERRORISM THAT THREATEN OR DISRUPT THE SAFE OPERATION OF COMPANY FACILITIES; AND



THE OCCURRENCE OF UNFORESEEN TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES (INCLUDING TECHNICAL PROBLEMS THAT MAY DELAY START-UP OR INTERRUPT PRODUCTION FROM AN UPSTREAM PROJECT OR THAT

MAY LEAD TO UNEXPECTED DOWNTIME OF REFINERIES OR PETROCHEMICAL PLANTS).

SEE SECTION 1 OF ITEM 2 OF THIS REPORT FOR A DISCUSSION OF ADDITIONAL FACTORS AFFECTING FUTURE CAPACITY GROWTH AND THE TIMING AND ULTIMATE RECOVERY OF RESERVES.

DISCUSSED ABOVE AND ELSEWHERE IN THIS REPORT.
