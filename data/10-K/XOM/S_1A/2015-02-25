ITEM 1A.       RISK FACTORS

EXXONMOBILS FINANCIAL AND OPERATING

RESULTS ARE SUBJECT TO A VARIETY OF RISKS INHERENT IN THE GLOBAL OIL, GAS, AND

PETROCHEMICAL BUSINESSES. MANY OF THESE RISK FACTORS ARE NOT WITHIN THE

COMPANYS CONTROL AND COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, OUR FINANCIAL AND

OPERATING RESULTS OR OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION. THESE RISK FACTORS INCLUDE.

SUPPLY AND DEMAND

THE OIL, GAS, AND PETROCHEMICAL BUSINESSES ARE

FUNDAMENTALLY COMMODITY BUSINESSES. THIS MEANS EXXONMOBILS OPERATIONS AND

EARNINGS MAY BE SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTED BY CHANGES IN OIL, GAS AND PETROCHEMICAL

PRICES AND BY CHANGES IN MARGINS ON REFINED PRODUCTS. OIL, GAS, PETROCHEMICAL

AND PRODUCT PRICES AND MARGINS IN TURN DEPEND ON LOCAL, REGIONAL AND GLOBAL

EVENTS OR CONDITIONS THAT AFFECT SUPPLY AND DEMAND FOR THE RELEVANT COMMODITY.

ECONOMIC CONDITIONS.

THE DEMAND FOR ENERGY AND PETROCHEMICALS CORRELATES CLOSELY WITH

GENERAL ECONOMIC GROWTH RATES. THE OCCURRENCE OF RECESSIONS OR OTHER PERIODS OF

LOW OR NEGATIVE ECONOMIC GROWTH WILL TYPICALLY HAVE A DIRECT ADVERSE IMPACT ON

OUR RESULTS. OTHER FACTORS THAT AFFECT GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS IN THE WORLD

OR IN A MAJOR REGION, SUCH AS CHANGES IN POPULATION GROWTH RATES, PERIODS OF

CIVIL UNREST, GOVERNMENT AUSTERITY PROGRAMS, OR CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE

FLUCTUATIONS, CAN ALSO IMPACT THE DEMAND FOR ENERGY AND PETROCHEMICALS.

SOVEREIGN DEBT DOWNGRADES, DEFAULTS, INABILITY TO ACCESS DEBT MARKETS DUE TO

CREDIT OR LEGAL CONSTRAINTS, LIQUIDITY CRISES, THE BREAKUP OR RESTRUCTURING OF

FISCAL, MONETARY, OR POLITICAL SYSTEMS SUCH AS THE EUROPEAN UNION, AND OTHER

EVENTS OR CONDITIONS THAT IMPAIR THE FUNCTIONING OF FINANCIAL MARKETS AND

INSTITUTIONS ALSO POSE RISKS TO EXXONMOBIL, INCLUDING RISKS TO THE SAFETY OF

OUR FINANCIAL ASSETS AND TO THE ABILITY OF OUR PARTNERS AND CUSTOMERS TO

FULFILL THEIR COMMITMENTS TO EXXONMOBIL.

OTHER DEMAND-RELATED FACTORS.

OTHER FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT THE DEMAND FOR OIL, GAS

AND PETROCHEMICALS, AND THEREFORE IMPACT OUR RESULTS, INCLUDE TECHNOLOGICAL

IMPROVEMENTS IN ENERGY EFFICIENCY; SEASONAL WEATHER PATTERNS, WHICH AFFECT THE

DEMAND FOR ENERGY ASSOCIATED WITH HEATING AND COOLING; INCREASED

COMPETITIVENESS OF ALTERNATIVE ENERGY SOURCES THAT HAVE SO FAR GENERALLY NOT

BEEN COMPETITIVE WITH OIL AND GAS WITHOUT THE BENEFIT OF GOVERNMENT SUBSIDIES

OR MANDATES; AND CHANGES IN TECHNOLOGY OR CONSUMER PREFERENCES THAT ALTER FUEL

CHOICES, SUCH AS TOWARD ALTERNATIVE FUELED VEHICLES.

OTHER SUPPLY-RELATED FACTORS.

COMMODITY PRICES AND MARGINS ALSO VARY DEPENDING ON A

NUMBER OF FACTORS AFFECTING SUPPLY. FOR EXAMPLE, INCREASED SUPPLY FROM THE

DEVELOPMENT OF NEW OIL AND GAS SUPPLY SOURCES AND TECHNOLOGIES TO ENHANCE

RECOVERY FROM EXISTING SOURCES TEND TO REDUCE COMMODITY PRICES TO THE EXTENT SUCH

SUPPLY INCREASES ARE NOT OFFSET BY COMMENSURATE GROWTH IN DEMAND. SIMILARLY,

INCREASES IN INDUSTRY REFINING OR PETROCHEMICAL MANUFACTURING CAPACITY TEND TO

REDUCE MARGINS ON THE AFFECTED PRODUCTS. WORLD OIL, GAS, AND PETROCHEMICAL

SUPPLY LEVELS CAN ALSO BE AFFECTED BY FACTORS THAT REDUCE AVAILABLE SUPPLIES,

SUCH AS ADHERENCE BY MEMBER COUNTRIES TO OPEC PRODUCTION QUOTAS AND THE

OCCURRENCE OF WARS, HOSTILE ACTIONS, NATURAL DISASTERS, DISRUPTIONS IN

COMPETITORS OPERATIONS, OR UNEXPECTED UNAVAILABILITY OF DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS

THAT MAY DISRUPT SUPPLIES. TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE CAN ALSO ALTER THE RELATIVE

COSTS FOR COMPETITORS TO FIND, PRODUCE, AND REFINE OIL AND GAS AND TO

MANUFACTURE PETROCHEMICALS.

OTHER MARKET FACTORS.

EXXONMOBILS BUSINESS RESULTS ARE ALSO EXPOSED TO

POTENTIAL NEGATIVE IMPACTS DUE TO CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES, INFLATION,

CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES, AND OTHER LOCAL OR REGIONAL MARKET CONDITIONS. WE

GENERALLY DO NOT USE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS TO HEDGE MARKET EXPOSURES.

GOVERNMENT AND POLITICAL FACTORS

EXXONMOBILS RESULTS CAN BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY

POLITICAL OR REGULATORY DEVELOPMENTS AFFECTING OUR OPERATIONS.

ACCESS LIMITATIONS.

A NUMBER OF COUNTRIES LIMIT ACCESS TO THEIR OIL AND GAS RESOURCES, OR

MAY PLACE RESOURCES OFF-LIMITS FROM DEVELOPMENT ALTOGETHER. RESTRICTIONS ON

FOREIGN INVESTMENT IN THE OIL AND GAS SECTOR TEND TO INCREASE IN TIMES OF HIGH

COMMODITY PRICES, WHEN NATIONAL GOVERNMENTS MAY HAVE LESS NEED OF OUTSIDE

SOURCES OF PRIVATE CAPITAL. MANY COUNTRIES ALSO RESTRICT THE IMPORT OR EXPORT

OF CERTAIN PRODUCTS BASED ON POINT OF ORIGIN.

RESTRICTIONS ON DOING BUSINESS.

EXXONMOBIL IS SUBJECT TO LAWS AND SANCTIONS IMPOSED

BY THE U.S. OR BY OTHER JURISDICTIONS WHERE WE DO BUSINESS THAT MAY PROHIBIT

EXXONMOBIL OR CERTAIN OF ITS AFFILIATES FROM DOING BUSINESS IN CERTAIN

COUNTRIES, OR RESTRICTING THE KIND OF BUSINESS THAT MAY BE CONDUCTED. SUCH

RESTRICTIONS MAY PROVIDE A COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE TO COMPETITORS WHO MAY NOT BE

SUBJECT TO COMPARABLE RESTRICTIONS.

LACK OF LEGAL CERTAINTY.

SOME COUNTRIES IN WHICH WE DO BUSINESS LACK

WELL-DEVELOPED LEGAL SYSTEMS, OR HAVE NOT YET ADOPTED CLEAR REGULATORY

FRAMEWORKS FOR OIL AND GAS DEVELOPMENT. LACK OF LEGAL CERTAINTY EXPOSES OUR

OPERATIONS TO INCREASED RISK OF ADVERSE OR UNPREDICTABLE ACTIONS BY GOVERNMENT

OFFICIALS, AND ALSO MAKES IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR US TO ENFORCE OUR CONTRACTS. IN

SOME CASES THESE RISKS CAN BE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AGREEMENTS TO ARBITRATE

DISPUTES IN AN INTERNATIONAL FORUM, BUT THE ADEQUACY OF THIS REMEDY MAY STILL

DEPEND ON THE LOCAL LEGAL SYSTEM TO ENFORCE AN AWARD.

2

REGULATORY AND LITIGATION RISKS.

EVEN IN COUNTRIES WITH WELL-DEVELOPED LEGAL

SYSTEMS WHERE EXXONMOBIL DOES BUSINESS, WE REMAIN EXPOSED TO CHANGES IN LAW

(INCLUDING CHANGES THAT RESULT FROM INTERNATIONAL TREATIES AND ACCORDS) THAT

COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS, SUCH AS.



INCREASES IN TAXES OR GOVERNMENT ROYALTY RATES

(INCLUDING RETROACTIVE CLAIMS);



PRICE CONTROLS;



CHANGES IN ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS OR OTHER LAWS

THAT INCREASE OUR COST OF COMPLIANCE OR REDUCE OR DELAY AVAILABLE BUSINESS

OPPORTUNITIES (INCLUDING CHANGES IN LAWS RELATED TO OFFSHORE DRILLING

OPERATIONS, WATER USE, OR HYDRAULIC FRACTURING);



ADOPTION OF REGULATIONS MANDATING THE USE OF

ALTERNATIVE FUELS OR UNCOMPETITIVE FUEL COMPONENTS;



ADOPTION OF GOVERNMENT PAYMENT TRANSPARENCY

REGULATIONS THAT COULD REQUIRE US TO DISCLOSE COMPETITIVELY SENSITIVE

COMMERCIAL INFORMATION, OR THAT COULD CAUSE US TO VIOLATE THE NON-DISCLOSURE

LAWS OF OTHER COUNTRIES; AND



GOVERNMENT ACTIONS TO CANCEL CONTRACTS,

RE-DENOMINATE THE OFFICIAL CURRENCY, RENOUNCE OR DEFAULT ON OBLIGATIONS,

RENEGOTIATE TERMS UNILATERALLY, OR EXPROPRIATE ASSETS.

LEGAL REMEDIES AVAILABLE TO COMPENSATE US FOR

EXPROPRIATION OR OTHER TAKINGS MAY BE INADEQUATE.

WE ALSO MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY THE OUTCOME OF

LITIGATION, ESPECIALLY IN COUNTRIES SUCH AS THE UNITED STATES IN WHICH VERY

LARGE AND UNPREDICTABLE PUNITIVE DAMAGE AWARDS MAY OCCUR, OR BY GOVERNMENT

ENFORCEMENT PROCEEDINGS ALLEGING NON-COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE LAWS OR

REGULATIONS.

SECURITY CONCERNS.

SUCCESSFUL OPERATION OF PARTICULAR FACILITIES OR PROJECTS MAY BE

DISRUPTED BY CIVIL UNREST, ACTS OF SABOTAGE OR TERRORISM, AND OTHER LOCAL

SECURITY CONCERNS. SUCH CONCERNS MAY REQUIRE US TO INCUR GREATER COSTS FOR

SECURITY OR TO SHUT DOWN OPERATIONS FOR A PERIOD OF TIME.

CLIMATE CHANGE AND GREENHOUSE GAS RESTRICTIONS.

DUE TO CONCERN OVER THE RISK OF CLIMATE CHANGE, A

NUMBER OF COUNTRIES HAVE ADOPTED, OR ARE CONSIDERING THE ADOPTION OF,

REGULATORY FRAMEWORKS TO REDUCE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS. THESE INCLUDE

ADOPTION OF CAP AND TRADE REGIMES, CARBON TAXES, RESTRICTIVE PERMITTING,

INCREASED EFFICIENCY STANDARDS, AND INCENTIVES OR MANDATES FOR RENEWABLE

ENERGY. THESE REQUIREMENTS COULD MAKE OUR PRODUCTS MORE EXPENSIVE, LENGTHEN

PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION TIMES, AND REDUCE DEMAND FOR HYDROCARBONS, AS WELL AS

SHIFT HYDROCARBON DEMAND TOWARD RELATIVELY LOWER-CARBON SOURCES SUCH AS NATURAL

GAS. CURRENT AND PENDING GREENHOUSE GAS REGULATIONS MAY ALSO INCREASE OUR

COMPLIANCE COSTS, SUCH AS FOR MONITORING OR SEQUESTERING EMISSIONS.

GOVERNMENT SPONSORSHIP OF ALTERNATIVE ENERGY.

MANY GOVERNMENTS ARE PROVIDING TAX ADVANTAGES AND

OTHER SUBSIDIES TO SUPPORT ALTERNATIVE ENERGY SOURCES OR ARE MANDATING THE USE

OF SPECIFIC FUELS OR TECHNOLOGIES. GOVERNMENTS ARE ALSO PROMOTING RESEARCH INTO

NEW TECHNOLOGIES TO REDUCE THE COST AND INCREASE THE SCALABILITY OF ALTERNATIVE

ENERGY SOURCES. WE ARE CONDUCTING OUR OWN RESEARCH EFFORTS INTO ALTERNATIVE

ENERGY, SUCH AS THROUGH SPONSORSHIP OF THE GLOBAL CLIMATE AND ENERGY PROJECT AT

STANFORD UNIVERSITY AND RESEARCH INTO LIQUID PRODUCTS FROM ALGAE AND BIOMASS

THAT CAN BE FURTHER CONVERTED TO TRANSPORTATION FUELS. OUR FUTURE RESULTS MAY

DEPEND IN PART ON THE SUCCESS OF OUR RESEARCH EFFORTS AND ON OUR ABILITY TO

ADAPT AND APPLY THE STRENGTHS OF OUR CURRENT BUSINESS MODEL TO PROVIDING THE ENERGY

PRODUCTS OF THE FUTURE IN A COST-COMPETITIVE MANNER. SEE MANAGEMENT

EFFECTIVENESS BELOW.

MANAGEMENT EFFECTIVENESS

IN ADDITION TO EXTERNAL ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL

FACTORS, OUR FUTURE BUSINESS RESULTS ALSO DEPEND ON OUR ABILITY TO MANAGE

SUCCESSFULLY THOSE FACTORS THAT ARE AT LEAST IN PART WITHIN OUR CONTROL. THE

EXTENT TO WHICH WE MANAGE THESE FACTORS WILL IMPACT OUR PERFORMANCE RELATIVE TO

COMPETITION. FOR PROJECTS IN WHICH WE ARE NOT THE OPERATOR, WE DEPEND ON THE

MANAGEMENT EFFECTIVENESS OF ONE OR MORE CO-VENTURERS WHOM WE DO NOT CONTROL.

EXPLORATION AND DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM.

OUR ABILITY TO MAINTAIN AND GROW OUR OIL AND GAS

PRODUCTION DEPENDS ON THE SUCCESS OF OUR EXPLORATION AND DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS.

AMONG OTHER FACTORS, WE MUST CONTINUOUSLY IMPROVE OUR ABILITY TO IDENTIFY THE

MOST PROMISING RESOURCE PROSPECTS AND APPLY OUR PROJECT MANAGEMENT EXPERTISE TO

BRING DISCOVERED RESOURCES ON LINE ON SCHEDULE AND WITHIN BUDGET.

PROJECT MANAGEMENT.

THE SUCCESS OF EXXONMOBILS UPSTREAM, DOWNSTREAM, AND CHEMICAL

BUSINESSES DEPENDS ON COMPLEX, LONG-TERM, CAPITAL INTENSIVE PROJECTS. THESE

PROJECTS IN TURN REQUIRE A HIGH DEGREE OF PROJECT MANAGEMENT EXPERTISE TO

MAXIMIZE EFFICIENCY. SPECIFIC FACTORS THAT CAN AFFECT THE PERFORMANCE OF MAJOR

PROJECTS INCLUDE OUR ABILITY TO: NEGOTIATE SUCCESSFULLY WITH JOINT VENTURERS,

PARTNERS, GOVERNMENTS, SUPPLIERS, CUSTOMERS, OR OTHERS; MODEL AND OPTIMIZE

RESERVOIR PERFORMANCE; DEVELOP MARKETS FOR PROJECT OUTPUTS, WHETHER THROUGH LONG-TERM

CONTRACTS OR THE DEVELOPMENT OF EFFECTIVE SPOT MARKETS; MANAGE CHANGES IN

OPERATING CONDITIONS AND COSTS, INCLUDING COSTS OF THIRD PARTY EQUIPMENT OR

SERVICES SUCH AS DRILLING RIGS AND SHIPPING; PREVENT, TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE,

AND RESPOND EFFECTIVELY TO UNFORESEEN TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES THAT COULD DELAY

PROJECT STARTUP OR CAUSE UNSCHEDULED PROJECT DOWNTIME; AND INFLUENCE THE

PERFORMANCE OF PROJECT OPERATORS WHERE EXXONMOBIL DOES NOT PERFORM THAT ROLE.

THE TERM PROJECT AS USED

IN THIS REPORT CAN REFER TO A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT ACTIVITIES AND DOES NOT

NECESSARILY HAVE THE SAME MEANING AS IN ANY GOVERNMENT PAYMENT TRANSPARENCY

REPORTS.

OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCY.

AN IMPORTANT COMPONENT OF EXXONMOBILS COMPETITIVE

PERFORMANCE, ESPECIALLY GIVEN THE COMMODITY-BASED NATURE OF MANY OF OUR

BUSINESSES, IS OUR ABILITY TO OPERATE EFFICIENTLY, INCLUDING OUR ABILITY TO

MANAGE EXPENSES AND IMPROVE PRODUCTION YIELDS ON AN ONGOING BASIS. THIS

REQUIRES CONTINUOUS MANAGEMENT FOCUS, INCLUDING TECHNOLOGY IMPROVEMENTS, COST

CONTROL, PRODUCTIVITY ENHANCEMENTS, REGULAR REAPPRAISAL OF OUR ASSET PORTFOLIO,

AND THE RECRUITMENT, DEVELOPMENT AND RETENTION OF HIGH CALIBER EMPLOYEES.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT.

TO MAINTAIN OUR COMPETITIVE POSITION, ESPECIALLY IN

LIGHT OF THE TECHNOLOGICAL NATURE OF OUR BUSINESSES AND THE NEED FOR CONTINUOUS

EFFICIENCY IMPROVEMENT, EXXONMOBILS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ORGANIZATIONS

MUST BE SUCCESSFUL AND ABLE TO ADAPT TO A CHANGING MARKET AND POLICY

ENVIRONMENT.

SAFETY, BUSINESS CONTROLS, AND ENVIRONMENTAL RISK

MANAGEMENT.

OUR RESULTS DEPEND ON

MANAGEMENTS ABILITY TO MINIMIZE THE INHERENT RISKS OF OIL, GAS, AND

PETROCHEMICAL OPERATIONS, TO CONTROL EFFECTIVELY OUR BUSINESS ACTIVITIES AND TO

MINIMIZE THE POTENTIAL FOR HUMAN ERROR. WE APPLY RIGOROUS MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS

AND CONTINUOUS FOCUS TO WORKPLACE SAFETY AND TO AVOIDING SPILLS OR OTHER

ADVERSE ENVIRONMENTAL EVENTS. FOR EXAMPLE, WE WORK TO MINIMIZE SPILLS THROUGH A

COMBINED PROGRAM OF EFFECTIVE OPERATIONS INTEGRITY MANAGEMENT, ONGOING

UPGRADES, KEY EQUIPMENT REPLACEMENTS, AND COMPREHENSIVE INSPECTION AND

SURVEILLANCE. SIMILARLY, WE ARE IMPLEMENTING COST-EFFECTIVE NEW TECHNOLOGIES

AND ADOPTING NEW OPERATING PRACTICES TO REDUCE AIR EMISSIONS, NOT ONLY IN

RESPONSE TO GOVERNMENT REQUIREMENTS BUT ALSO TO ADDRESS COMMUNITY PRIORITIES.

WE ALSO MAINTAIN A DISCIPLINED FRAMEWORK OF INTERNAL CONTROLS AND APPLY A

CONTROLS MANAGEMENT SYSTEM FOR MONITORING COMPLIANCE WITH THIS FRAMEWORK.

SUBSTANTIAL LIABILITIES AND OTHER ADVERSE IMPACTS COULD RESULT IF OUR MANAGEMENT

SYSTEMS AND CONTROLS DO NOT FUNCTION AS INTENDED. THE ABILITY TO INSURE AGAINST

SUCH RISKS IS LIMITED BY THE CAPACITY OF THE APPLICABLE INSURANCE MARKETS,

WHICH MAY NOT BE SUFFICIENT.

BUSINESS RISKS ALSO INCLUDE THE RISK OF CYBERSECURITY

BREACHES. IF OUR SYSTEMS FOR PROTECTING AGAINST CYBERSECURITY RISKS PROVE NOT

TO BE SUFFICIENT, EXXONMOBIL COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED SUCH AS BY HAVING ITS

BUSINESS SYSTEMS COMPROMISED, ITS PROPRIETARY INFORMATION ALTERED, LOST OR

STOLEN, OR ITS BUSINESS OPERATIONS DISRUPTED.

PREPAREDNESS.

OUR OPERATIONS MAY BE DISRUPTED BY SEVERE WEATHER EVENTS, NATURAL DISASTERS,

HUMAN ERROR, AND SIMILAR EVENTS. FOR EXAMPLE, HURRICANES MAY DAMAGE OUR

OFFSHORE PRODUCTION FACILITIES OR COASTAL REFINING AND PETROCHEMICAL PLANTS IN

VULNERABLE AREAS. OUR ABILITY TO MITIGATE THE ADVERSE IMPACTS OF THESE EVENTS

DEPENDS IN PART UPON THE EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR RIGOROUS DISASTER PREPAREDNESS

AND RESPONSE PLANNING, AS WELL AS BUSINESS CONTINUITY PLANNING.

EXXONMOBILS PLANS AND OBJECTIVES INCLUDED OR INCORPORATED IN ITEMS 1, 1A, 2, 7

AND 7A OF THIS REPORT ARE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS. ACTUAL FUTURE RESULTS,

INCLUDING PROJECT COMPLETION DATES, PRODUCTION RATES, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES,

COSTS AND BUSINESS PLANS COULD DIFFER MATERIALLY DUE TO, AMONG OTHER THINGS,

THE FACTORS DISCUSSED ABOVE AND ELSEWHERE IN THIS REPORT.
