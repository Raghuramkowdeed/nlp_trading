PART I

ITEM 1. BUSINESS.

EXXON MOBIL CORPORATION ("EXXONMOBIL"), FORMERLY NAMED EXXON CORPORATION,

WAS INCORPORATED IN THE STATE OF NEW JERSEY IN 1882.

ON DECEMBER 1, 1998, EXXON CORPORATION ("EXXON") AND MOBIL CORPORATION

("MOBIL") SIGNED AN AGREEMENT TO MERGE THE TWO COMPANIES SUBJECT TO

SHAREHOLDER APPROVAL, REGULATORY REVIEWS AND OTHER CONDITIONS. ON NOVEMBER 30,

1999, PURSUANT TO THE AGREEMENT, A WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARY OF EXXON WAS MERGED

WITH AND INTO MOBIL SO THAT MOBIL BECAME A WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARY OF EXXON.

AT THE SAME TIME, EXXON CHANGED ITS NAME TO EXXON MOBIL CORPORATION.

COINCIDENT WITH THE MERGER, EXXONMOBIL ANNOUNCED A NEW ORGANIZATION

STRUCTURE BUILT ON A CONCEPT OF ELEVEN SEPARATE GLOBAL BUSINESSES DESIGNED TO

ALLOW THE COMPANY TO COMPETE MORE EFFECTIVELY IN A CHANGING WORLDWIDE ENERGY

INDUSTRY: FIVE UPSTREAM BUSINESSES--EXPLORATION, DEVELOPMENT, PRODUCTION, GAS

MARKETING AND UPSTREAM RESEARCH; FOUR DOWNSTREAM BUSINESSES-- REFINING AND

SUPPLY, FUELS MARKETING, LUBRICANTS AND PETROLEUM SPECIALTIES, AND TECHNOLOGY;

PLUS A CHEMICAL COMPANY AND A COAL AND MINERALS COMPANY.

DIVISIONS AND AFFILIATED COMPANIES OF EXXONMOBIL OPERATE OR MARKET PRODUCTS

IN THE UNITED STATES AND ABOUT 200 OTHER COUNTRIES AND TERRITORIES. THEIR

PRINCIPAL BUSINESS IS ENERGY, INVOLVING EXPLORATION FOR, AND PRODUCTION OF,

CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS, MANUFACTURING OF PETROLEUM PRODUCTS AND

TRANSPORTATION AND SALE OF CRUDE OIL, NATURAL GAS AND PETROLEUM PRODUCTS.

EXXONMOBIL IS A MAJOR MANUFACTURER AND MARKETER OF BASIC PETROCHEMICALS,

INCLUDING OLEFINS, AROMATICS, POLYETHYLENE AND POLYPROPYLENE PLASTICS AND A

WIDE VARIETY OF SPECIALTY PRODUCTS. EXXONMOBIL IS ENGAGED IN EXPLORATION FOR,

AND MINING AND SALE OF COAL, COPPER AND OTHER MINERALS. EXXONMOBIL ALSO HAS

INTERESTS IN ELECTRIC POWER GENERATION FACILITIES. AFFILIATES OF EXXONMOBIL

CONDUCT EXTENSIVE RESEARCH PROGRAMS IN SUPPORT OF THESE BUSINESSES.

EXXON MOBIL CORPORATION HAS SEVERAL DIVISIONS AND HUNDREDS OF AFFILIATES,

MANY WITH NAMES THAT INCLUDE EXXONMOBIL, EXXON, ESSO OR MOBIL. FOR CONVENIENCE

AND SIMPLICITY, IN THIS REPORT THE TERMS EXXONMOBIL, EXXON, ESSO AND MOBIL, AS

WELL AS THE TERMS CORPORATION, COMPANY, OUR, WE AND ITS, ARE SOMETIMES USED AS

ABBREVIATED REFERENCES TO SPECIFIC AFFILIATES OR GROUPS OF AFFILIATES. THE

PRECISE MEANING DEPENDS ON THE CONTEXT IN QUESTION.

IN 2000, THE CORPORATION SPENT $1,529 MILLION (OF WHICH $393 MILLION WERE

CAPITAL EXPENDITURES) ON ENVIRONMENTAL PROJECTS AND EXPENSES WORLDWIDE, MOSTLY

DEALING WITH AIR AND WATER CONSERVATION. TOTAL EXPENDITURES FOR SUCH

ACTIVITIES ARE EXPECTED TO BE ABOUT $1.8 BILLION IN BOTH 2001 AND 2002 (WITH

CAPITAL EXPENDITURES REPRESENTING ABOUT 25 PERCENT OF THE TOTAL).

OPERATING DATA AND INDUSTRY SEGMENT INFORMATION FOR THE CORPORATION ARE

CONTAINED ON PAGES 50, 56 AND 57; INFORMATION ON OIL AND GAS RESERVES IS

CONTAINED ON PAGES 53 AND 54 AND INFORMATION ON COMPANY-SPONSORED RESEARCH AND

DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES IS CONTAINED ON PAGE 34 OF THE FINANCIAL SECTION OF

THIS REPORT.

FACTORS AFFECTING FUTURE RESULTS

--------------------------------

COMPETITIVE FACTORS: THE ENERGY AND PETROCHEMICAL INDUSTRIES ARE HIGHLY

COMPETITIVE. THERE IS COMPETITION WITHIN THE INDUSTRIES AND ALSO WITH OTHER

INDUSTRIES IN SUPPLYING THE ENERGY, FUEL AND CHEMICAL NEEDS OF INDUSTRY AND

INDIVIDUAL CONSUMERS. THE CORPORATION COMPETES WITH OTHER FIRMS IN THE SALE OR

PURCHASE OF VARIOUS GOODS OR SERVICES IN MANY NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL

MARKETS AND EMPLOYS ALL METHODS OF COMPETITION WHICH ARE LAWFUL AND

APPROPRIATE FOR SUCH PURPOSES.

POLITICAL FACTORS: THE OPERATIONS AND EARNINGS OF THE CORPORATION AND ITS

AFFILIATES THROUGHOUT THE WORLD HAVE BEEN, AND MAY IN THE FUTURE BE, AFFECTED

FROM TIME TO TIME IN VARYING DEGREE BY POLITICAL INSTABILITY AND BY OTHER

POLITICAL DEVELOPMENTS AND LAWS AND REGULATIONS, SUCH AS FORCED DIVESTITURE OF

1

ASSETS; RESTRICTIONS ON PRODUCTION, IMPORTS AND EXPORTS; PRICE CONTROLS; TAX

INCREASES AND RETROACTIVE TAX CLAIMS; EXPROPRIATION OF PROPERTY; CANCELLATION

OF CONTRACT RIGHTS AND ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS. BOTH THE LIKELIHOOD OF SUCH

OCCURRENCES AND THEIR OVERALL EFFECT UPON THE CORPORATION VARY GREATLY FROM

COUNTRY TO COUNTRY AND ARE NOT PREDICTABLE.

INDUSTRY AND ECONOMIC FACTORS: THE OPERATIONS AND EARNINGS OF THE CORPORATION

AND ITS AFFILIATES THROUGHOUT THE WORLD ARE ALSO AFFECTED BY LOCAL, REGIONAL

AND GLOBAL EVENTS OR CONDITIONS THAT AFFECT SUPPLY AND DEMAND FOR OIL, NATURAL

GAS, PETROLEUM PRODUCTS, PETROCHEMICALS AND OTHER EXXONMOBIL PRODUCTS. THESE

EVENTS OR CONDITIONS ARE GENERALLY NOT PREDICTABLE AND INCLUDE, AMONG OTHER

THINGS, THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW SUPPLY SOURCES; SUPPLY DISRUPTIONS; WEATHER;

INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL EVENTS; TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES; CHANGES IN

DEMOGRAPHICS AND CONSUMER PREFERENCES AND THE COMPETITIVENESS OF ALTERNATIVE

ENERGY SOURCES OR PRODUCT SUBSTITUTES.

PROJECT FACTORS: THE ADVANCEMENT, COST AND RESULTS OF PARTICULAR EXXONMOBIL

PROJECTS ALSO DEPEND ON THE OUTCOME OF NEGOTIATIONS WITH PARTNERS,

GOVERNMENTS, SUPPLIERS, CUSTOMERS OR OTHERS; CHANGES IN OPERATING CONDITIONS

OR COSTS AND THE OCCURRENCE OF UNFORESEEN TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES.

MERGER-RELATED FACTORS: REALIZATION OF THE BENEFITS OF THE MERGER WILL DEPEND,

AMONG OTHER THINGS, UPON MANAGEMENT'S ABILITY TO INTEGRATE THE BUSINESSES OF

EXXON AND MOBIL SUCCESSFULLY AND ON SCHEDULE. FUTURE RESULTS COULD ALSO BE

AFFECTED BY THE DIVERSION OF MANAGEMENT'S FOCUS AND RESOURCES FROM OTHER

STRATEGIC OPPORTUNITIES DURING THE MERGER INTEGRATION PROCESS.

MARKET RISK FACTORS: SEE ALSO PAGE 23 AND 24 OF THE FINANCIAL SECTION OF THIS

REPORT FOR DISCUSSION OF THE IMPACT OF MARKET RISKS, INFLATION AND OTHER

UNCERTAINTIES.

PROJECTIONS, ESTIMATES AND DESCRIPTIONS OF EXXONMOBIL'S PLANS AND OBJECTIVES

INCLUDED OR INCORPORATED IN ITEMS 1, 2, 7 AND 7A OF THIS REPORT ARE FORWARD-

LOOKING STATEMENTS. ACTUAL FUTURE RESULTS, INCLUDING MERGER RELATED EXPENSES,

SYNERGY BENEFITS FROM THE MERGER (INCLUDING COST SAVINGS, EFFICIENCY GAINS AND

REVENUE ENHANCEMENTS), PROJECT COMPLETION DATES, PRODUCTION RATES, CAPITAL

EXPENDITURES, COSTS AND BUSINESS PLANS COULD DIFFER MATERIALLY DUE TO, AMONG

OTHER THINGS, THE FACTORS DISCUSSED ABOVE AND ELSEWHERE IN THIS REPORT.

ITEM 2. PROPERTIES.

PART OF THE INFORMATION IN RESPONSE TO THIS ITEM AND TO THE SECURITIES

EXCHANGE ACT INDUSTRY GUIDE 2 IS CONTAINED IN THE FINANCIAL SECTION OF THIS

REPORT IN NOTE 10, WHICH NOTE APPEARS ON PAGE 36, AND ON PAGES 51 THROUGH 55

AND 57.

INFORMATION WITH REGARD TO OIL AND GAS PRODUCING ACTIVITIES FOLLOWS.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

1. NET RESERVES OF CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS LIQUIDS (MILLIONS OF BARRELS) AND

NATURAL GAS (BILLIONS OF CUBIC FEET) AT YEAR-END 2000

ESTIMATED PROVED RESERVES ARE SHOWN ON PAGES 53 AND 54 OF THE FINANCIAL

SECTION OF THIS REPORT. NO MAJOR DISCOVERY OR OTHER FAVORABLE OR ADVERSE EVENT

HAS OCCURRED SINCE DECEMBER 31, 2000, THAT WOULD CAUSE A SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN

THE ESTIMATED PROVED RESERVES AS OF THAT DATE. FOR INFORMATION ON THE

STANDARDIZED MEASURE OF DISCOUNTED FUTURE NET CASH FLOWS RELATING TO PROVED

OIL AND GAS RESERVES, SEE PAGE 55 OF THE FINANCIAL SECTION OF THIS REPORT.

2. ESTIMATES OF TOTAL NET PROVED OIL AND GAS RESERVES FILED WITH OTHER FEDERAL

AGENCIES

DURING 2000, EXXONMOBIL FILED PROVED RESERVES ESTIMATES WITH THE U.S.

DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY ON FORMS EIA-23 AND EIA-28. THE INFORMATION IS CONSISTENT

WITH THE EXXONMOBIL 1999 ANNUAL REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS WITH THE EXCEPTION OF

EIA-23 WHICH COVERED TOTAL OIL AND GAS RESERVES FROM

2

EXXONMOBIL-OPERATED PROPERTIES IN THE UNITED STATES AND DOES NOT INCLUDE GAS

PLANT LIQUIDS. THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE OIL RESERVES AND GAS RESERVES

REPORTED ON EIA-23 AND THOSE REPORTED IN THE 1999 ANNUAL REPORT EXCEED FIVE

PERCENT.

3. AVERAGE SALES PRICES AND PRODUCTION COSTS PER UNIT OF PRODUCTION

REFERENCE IS MADE TO PAGE 51 OF THE FINANCIAL SECTION OF THIS REPORT.

AVERAGE SALES PRICES HAVE BEEN CALCULATED BY USING SALES QUANTITIES FROM OUR

OWN PRODUCTION AS THE DIVISOR. AVERAGE PRODUCTION COSTS HAVE BEEN COMPUTED BY

USING NET PRODUCTION QUANTITIES FOR THE DIVISOR. THE VOLUMES OF CRUDE OIL AND

NATURAL GAS LIQUIDS (NGL) PRODUCTION USED FOR THIS COMPUTATION ARE SHOWN IN

THE RESERVES TABLE ON PAGE 53 OF THE FINANCIAL SECTION OF THIS REPORT. THE NET

PRODUCTION VOLUMES OF NATURAL GAS AVAILABLE FOR SALE BY THE PRODUCING FUNCTION

USED IN THIS CALCULATION ARE SHOWN ON PAGE 57 OF THE FINANCIAL SECTION OF THIS

REPORT. THE VOLUMES OF NATURAL GAS WERE CONVERTED TO OIL-EQUIVALENT BARRELS

BASED ON A CONVERSION FACTOR OF SIX THOUSAND CUBIC FEET PER BARREL.

TYPICALLY GOVERNED BY PRODUCTION SHARING CONTRACTS (PSCS) WITH THE NATIONAL

OIL COMPANY. THE NATIONAL OIL COMPANY HOLDS THE UNDERLYING OIL PROSPECTING

LICENSE (OPL) AND ANY RESULTING OIL MINING LEASE (OML). THE TERMS OF THE PSCS

ARE GENERALLY 30 YEARS, INCLUDING A TEN-YEAR EXPLORATION PERIOD (SIX-YEAR

INITIAL EXPLORATION PHASE PLUS A FOUR-YEAR OPTIONAL PERIOD) WITH NO REQUIRED

RELINQUISHMENT AFTER THE INITIAL PHASE, A 50 PERCENT RELINQUISHMENT

REQUIREMENT AFTER THE SECOND PHASE AND A 20-YEAR PRODUCTION PERIOD THAT MAY BE

EXTENDED.

SOME EXPLORATION ACTIVITIES ARE CARRIED OUT IN DEEPWATER BY JOINT VENTURES

WITH INDIGENOUS COMPANIES AS DIRECT PARTICIPANTS IN AN OPL. OPLS IN DEEPWATER

OFFSHORE AREAS ARE VALID FOR TEN YEARS AND ARE NON-RENEWABLE, WHILE IN ALL

OTHER AREAS OPLS ARE FOR FIVE YEARS AND ALSO ARE NON-RENEWABLE. DEMONSTRATING

A COMMERCIAL DISCOVERY IS THE BASIS FOR CONVERSION OF AN OPL TO AN OML.

OMLS GRANTED PRIOR TO THE 1969 PETROLEUM ACT, (I.E., UNDER THE MINERALS OILS

ACT 1914, REPEALED BY THE 1969 PETROLEUM ACT) WERE FOR 30 YEARS ONSHORE AND 40

YEARS IN OFFSHORE AREAS AND ARE RENEWABLE UPON 12 MONTHS WRITTEN NOTICE, FOR

FURTHER PERIODS OF 30 AND 40 YEARS, RESPECTIVELY.

6

OMLS GRANTED UNDER THE 1969 PETROLEUM ACT, WHICH INCLUDE ALL DEEPWATER OMLS,

HAVE A MAXIMUM TERM OF 20 YEARS WITHOUT DISTINCTION FOR ON- OR OFFSHORE

LOCATION AND ARE RENEWABLE, UPON 12 MONTHS WRITTEN NOTICE, FOR ANOTHER PERIOD

OF 20 YEARS. OMLS NOT HELD BY THE NATIONAL OIL COMPANY ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO A

MANDATORY 50 PERCENT RELINQUISHMENT, AFTER THE FIRST TEN YEARS OF THEIR

DURATION.

IN ALL CASES, RENEWAL OF OMLS IS ALMOST CERTAIN IF LESSEE SATISFIES THREE

CONDITIONS, NAMELY, LESSEE: I) GIVES THE REQUISITE NOTICE WITHIN THE MINIMUM

STIPULATED PERIOD; II) HAS PAID UP-TO-DATE ALL RENTALS, ROYALTIES AND FEES AND

III) HAS FULFILLED ALL LESSEE'S OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE OML.

THE MOU (MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING) DEFINING COMMERCIAL TERMS APPLICABLE

TO EXISTING OIL PRODUCTION WAS RENEGOTIATED AND EXECUTED IN 2000 AND IS

EFFECTIVE FOR A MINIMUM OF THREE YEARS WITH POSSIBLE EXTENSION ON MUTUAL

AGREEMENT. GUIDELINES FOR MARGINAL FIELD DEVELOPMENT WERE ISSUED BY THE

GOVERNMENT.

OTHER COUNTRIES

INFORMATION WITH REGARD TO MINING ACTIVITIES FOLLOWS.

-----------------------------------------------------

SYNCRUDE OPERATIONS

SYNCRUDE IS A JOINT-VENTURE ESTABLISHED TO RECOVER SHALLOW DEPOSITS OF TAR

SANDS USING OPEN-PIT MINING METHODS, TO EXTRACT THE CRUDE BITUMEN, AND TO

PRODUCE A HIGH-QUALITY, LIGHT (32 DEGREE API), SWEET, SYNTHETIC CRUDE OIL. THE

SYNCRUDE OPERATION, LOCATED NEAR FORT MCMURRAY, ALBERTA, CANADA, EXPLOITS A

PORTION OF THE ATHABASCA OIL SANDS DEPOSIT. THE LOCATION IS READILY ACCESSIBLE

BY PUBLIC ROAD. THE PRODUCED SYNTHETIC CRUDE OIL IS SHIPPED FROM THE SYNCRUDE

SITE TO EDMONTON, ALBERTA IN THE ALBERTA OIL SANDS PIPELINE OWNED BY THE

ALBERTA ENERGY COMPANY LTD. SINCE STARTUP IN 1978, SYNCRUDE HAS PRODUCED 1.2

BILLION BARRELS OF SYNTHETIC CRUDE OIL. IMPERIAL OIL LIMITED IS THE OWNER OF A

25 PERCENT INTEREST IN THE JOINT-VENTURE. EXXON MOBIL CORPORATION HAS A 69.6

PERCENT INTEREST IN IMPERIAL OIL LIMITED.

OPERATING LICENSE AND LEASES

SYNCRUDE HAS AN OPERATING LICENSE ISSUED BY THE PROVINCE OF ALBERTA WHICH IS

EFFECTIVE UNTIL 2035. THIS LICENSE PERMITS SYNCRUDE TO MINE TAR SANDS AND

PRODUCE SYNTHETIC CRUDE OIL FROM APPROVED DEVELOPMENT AREAS ON TAR SANDS

LEASES. SYNCRUDE HOLDS EIGHT TAR SANDS LEASES COVERING APPROXIMATELY 255,000

ACRES IN THE ATHABASCA OIL SANDS DEPOSIT. ISSUED BY THE PROVINCE OF ALBERTA,

THE LEASES ARE AUTOMATICALLY RENEWABLE AS LONG AS TAR SANDS OPERATIONS ARE

ONGOING OR THE LEASES ARE PART OF AN APPROVED DEVELOPMENT PLAN. SYNCRUDE

LEASES 10, 12, 17, 22 AND 34 (CONTAINING PROVEN RESERVES) AND LEASES 29, 30

AND 31 (CONTAINING NO PROVEN RESERVES) ARE INCLUDED WITHIN A DEVELOPMENT PLAN

APPROVED BY THE PROVINCE OF ALBERTA'S DEPARTMENT OF RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT.

THERE WERE NO KNOWN PREVIOUS COMMERCIAL OPERATIONS ON THESE LEASES PRIOR TO

THE START-UP OF OPERATIONS IN 1978.

OPERATIONS, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT

OPERATIONS AT SYNCRUDE INVOLVE THREE MAIN PROCESSES: OPEN PIT MINING,

EXTRACTION OF CRUDE BITUMEN AND UPGRADING OF CRUDE BITUMEN INTO SYNTHETIC

CRUDE OIL. IN THE BASE MINE (LEASE 17), THE MINING AND TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM

USES DRAGLINES, BUCKETWHEEL RECLAIMERS AND BELT CONVEYORS. IN THE NORTH MINE

(LEASES 17 AND 22) AND IN THE AURORA MINE (LEASES 10, 12 AND 34), A TRUCK,

SHOVEL AND HYDROTRANSPORT SYSTEM IS USED. PRODUCTION FROM THE AURORA MINE

COMMENCED IN 2000. THE EXTRACTION FACILITIES, WHICH SEPARATE CRUDE BITUMEN

FROM SAND, ARE CAPABLE OF PROCESSING APPROXIMATELY 545,000 TONS OF TAR SANDS A

DAY, PRODUCING 110 MILLION BARRELS OF CRUDE BITUMEN A YEAR. THIS REPRESENTS

RECOVERY CAPABILITY OF ABOUT 92 PERCENT OF THE CRUDE BITUMEN CONTAINED IN THE

MINED TAR SANDS.

CRUDE BITUMEN EXTRACTED FROM TAR SANDS IS REFINED TO A MARKETABLE

HYDROCARBON PRODUCT THROUGH A COMBINATION OF CARBON REMOVAL IN TWO LARGE,

HIGH-TEMPERATURE, FLUID-COKING VESSELS AND BY HYDROGEN ADDITION IN HIGH-

TEMPERATURE, HIGH-PRESSURE, HYDROCRACKING VESSELS. THESE PROCESSES REMOVE

CARBON AND SULFUR AND REFORMULATE THE CRUDE INTO A LOW VISCOSITY, LOW SULFUR,

HIGH-QUALITY SYNTHETIC CRUDE OIL PRODUCT. IN 2000 THIS UPGRADING PROCESS

YIELDED 0.843 BARRELS OF SYNTHETIC CRUDE OIL PER BARREL OF CRUDE BITUMEN.

ABOUT TWO-THIRDS OF THE SYNTHETIC CRUDE OIL IS PROCESSED BY EDMONTON AREA

REFINERIES AND THE REMAINING ONE-THIRD IS PIPELINED TO REFINERIES IN EASTERN

CANADA AND THE MID-WESTERN UNITED STATES. ELECTRICITY IS PROVIDED TO SYNCRUDE

BY A 270 MEGAWATT ELECTRICITY GENERATING PLANT AND AN 80 MEGAWATT ELECTRICITY

GENERATING PLANT, BOTH LOCATED AT SYNCRUDE. THE GENERATING PLANTS ARE OWNED BY

THE SYNCRUDE PARTICIPANTS. IMPERIAL OIL LIMITED'S 25 PERCENT SHARE OF NET

INVESTMENT IN PLANT, PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT, INCLUDING SURFACE MINING

FACILITIES, TRANSPORTATION EQUIPMENT AND UPGRADING FACILITIES IS $690 MILLION.

13

SYNTHETIC CRUDE OIL RESERVES

THE CRUDE BITUMEN IS CONTAINED WITHIN THE UNCONSOLIDATED SANDS OF THE

MCMURRAY FORMATION. ORE BODIES ARE BURIED BENEATH 50 TO 150 FEET OF

OVERBURDEN, HAVE BITUMEN GRADES RANGING FROM 4 TO 14 WEIGHT PERCENT AND ORE

THICKNESS OF 115 TO 160 FEET. ESTIMATES OF SYNTHETIC CRUDE OIL RESERVES ARE

BASED ON DETAILED GEOLOGICAL AND ENGINEERING ASSESSMENTS OF IN-PLACE CRUDE

BITUMEN VOLUME, THE MINING PLAN, HISTORICAL EXTRACTION RECOVERY AND UPGRADING

YIELD FACTORS, INSTALLED PLANT OPERATING CAPACITY AND OPERATING APPROVAL

LIMITS. THE IN-PLACE VOLUME, DEPTH AND GRADE ARE ESTABLISHED THROUGH EXTENSIVE

AND CLOSELY SPACED CORE DRILLING. PROVEN RESERVES INCLUDE THE OPERATING BASE

AND NORTH MINES AND THE AURORA MINE. IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE APPROVED MINING

PLAN, THERE ARE AN ESTIMATED 3,535 MILLION TONS OF EXTRACTABLE TAR SANDS IN

THE BASE AND NORTH MINES, WITH AN AVERAGE BITUMEN GRADE OF 10.4 WEIGHT

PERCENT. IN ADDITION, AT THE AURORA MINE, THERE ARE AN ESTIMATED 1,645 MILLION

TONS OF EXTRACTABLE TAR SANDS AT AN AVERAGE BITUMEN GRADE OF 11.3 WEIGHT

PERCENT. AFTER DEDUCTING ROYALTIES PAYABLE TO THE PROVINCE OF ALBERTA,

IMPERIAL OIL LIMITED ESTIMATES ITS 25 PERCENT NET SHARE OF PROVEN RESERVES IS

EQUIVALENT TO 610 MILLION BARRELS OF SYNTHETIC CRUDE OIL.

REVIEW OF 2000 RESULTS

EARNINGS EXCLUDING MERGER EFFECTS AND SPECIAL ITEMS WERE $16,910 MILLION, AN

INCREASE OF $8,530 MILLION FROM 1999. NET INCOME IN 2000 OF $17,720 MILLION,

INCLUDING NET FAVORABLE MERGER EFFECTS OF $810 MILLION, INCREASED $9,810 MILLION

FROM 1999. UPSTREAM (EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION) EARNINGS BENEFITED FROM HIGHER

CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS REALIZATIONS, WHICH ON AVERAGE WERE UP ABOUT 60

PERCENT AND 45 PERCENT, RESPECTIVELY, VERSUS 1999. EXCLUDING THE EFFECTS OF

LOWER ENTITLEMENTS CAUSED BY HIGHER CRUDE PRICES, LIQUIDS PRODUCTION WAS 3

PERCENT HIGHER THAN 1999. DOWNSTREAM (REFINING AND MARKETING) EARNINGS IMPROVED

FROM THE VERY DEPRESSED RESULTS IN 1999, DRIVEN BY STRONGER WORLDWIDE REFINING

MARGINS AND BETTER REFINING OPERATIONS. HOWEVER, DOWNSTREAM PROFITABILITY WAS

RESTRAINED BY DIFFICULTIES IN RECOVERING THE SIGNIFICANT INCREASES IN RAW

MATERIAL COSTS THAT OCCURRED OVER MUCH OF THE YEAR. MERGER IMPLEMENTATION

ACTIVITIES IN 2000 ADDED A NET $810 MILLION TO NET INCOME, REFLECTING $1,730

MILLION OF GAINS FROM ASSET DIVESTITURES THAT WERE A CONDITION OF REGULATORY

APPROVAL OF THE MERGER. THESE GAINS MORE THAN OFFSET MERGER IMPLEMENTATION

EXPENSES OF $920 MILLION. RESULTS IN 1999 INCLUDED $470 MILLION OF NET CHARGES

FOR SPECIAL ITEMS, PRIMARILY MERGER EXPENSES WITH OTHER SPECIAL ITEMS

ESSENTIALLY OFFSETTING. REVENUE FOR 2000 TOTALED $233 BILLION, UP 25 PERCENT

FROM 1999, AND THE COST OF CRUDE OIL AND PRODUCT PURCHASES INCREASED BY 41

PERCENT, BOTH INFLUENCED BY HIGHER PRICES.

EXCLUDING MERGER EXPENSES, THE COMBINED TOTAL OF OPERATING COSTS (INCLUDING

OPERATING, SELLING, GENERAL, ADMINISTRATIVE, EXPLORATION, DEPRECIATION AND

DEPLETION EXPENSES FROM THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF INCOME AND EXXONMOBIL'S

SHARE OF SIMILAR COSTS FOR EQUITY COMPANIES) IN 2000 WERE $43.6 BILLION, DOWN

ABOUT $700 MILLION FROM 1999. THE IMPACT OF EFFICIENCY INITIATIVES, INCLUDING

THE CAPTURE OF MERGER SYNERGIES, REDUCED OPERATING COSTS BY $1.6 BILLION.

INTEREST EXPENSE IN 2000 WAS $589 MILLION COMPARED TO $695 MILLION IN 1999 AS

THE EFFECT OF LOWER DEBT LEVELS WAS PARTLY OFFSET BY HIGHER INTEREST RATES.

UPSTREAM

UPSTREAM EARNINGS OF $12,369 MILLION INCREASED DUE TO HIGHER CRUDE OIL AND

NATURAL GAS REALIZATIONS, UP ABOUT 60 PERCENT AND 45 PERCENT, RESPECTIVELY.

LIQUIDS PRODUCTION OF 2,553 KBD (THOUSANDS OF BARRELS DAILY) INCREASED FROM

2,517 KBD IN 1999. EXCLUDING THE EFFECTS OF LOWER ENTITLEMENTS CAUSED BY HIGHER

CRUDE PRICES, LIQUIDS PRODUCTION WAS 3 PERCENT HIGHER THAN 1999, MAINLY

REFLECTING NEW PRODUCTION FROM FIELDS IN THE NORTH SEA AND VENEZUELA AND

INCREASED PRODUCTION FROM EASTERN CANADA AND ALASKA. THESE INCREASES MORE THAN

OFFSET THE EFFECTS OF NATURAL FIELD DECLINES. NATURAL GAS PRODUCTION OF 10,343

MCFD (MILLIONS OF CUBIC FEET DAILY) WAS ABOUT THE SAME AS 1999 REFLECTING HIGHER

PRODUCTION IN EASTERN CANADA, EUROPE AND QATAR, OFFSET BY LOWER PRODUCTION IN

INDONESIA. EXCLUDING ENTITLEMENT IMPACTS, NATURAL GAS PRODUCTION INCREASED ABOUT

1 PERCENT. LOWER EXPLORATION EXPENSES ALSO BENEFITED 2000 UPSTREAM EARNINGS.

EARNINGS FROM U.S. UPSTREAM OPERATIONS WERE $4,545 MILLION, AN INCREASE OF

$2,703 MILLION FROM 1999. EARNINGS OUTSIDE THE U.S. WERE $7,824 MILLION, $3,899

MILLION HIGHER THAN LAST YEAR, EXCLUDING A $141 MILLION DEFERRED TAX BENEFIT AND

A $22 MILLION PROPERTY WRITE-OFF IN 1999.

DOWNSTREAM

DOWNSTREAM EARNINGS OF $3,418 MILLION IMPROVED OVER $2 BILLION FROM THE VERY

DEPRESSED RESULTS IN 1999, DRIVEN BY STRONGER WORLDWIDE REFINING MARGINS AND

BETTER REFINING OPERATIONS. EARNINGS ALSO BENEFITED FROM A PLANNED REDUCTION IN

INVENTORIES AS A RESULT OF MERGING EXXON AND MOBIL OPERATIONS AROUND THE WORLD.

PETROLEUM PRODUCT SALES OF 7,993 KBD COMPARED WITH 8,887 KBD IN 1999. THE

DECREASE REFLECTED THE EFFECTS OF THE REQUIRED DIVESTITURE OF MOBIL'S EUROPEAN

FUELS JOINT VENTURE AND OF U.S. MARKETING AND REFINING ASSETS, AS WELL AS LOWER

SUPPLY SALES IN ASIA-PACIFIC RESULTING FROM THE LOW MARGIN ENVIRONMENT. REFINERY

THROUGHPUT WAS 5,642 KBD COMPARED WITH 5,977 KBD IN 1999. EXCLUDING THE EFFECTS

OF THE DIVESTMENTS, REFINERY THROUGHPUT IN 2000 WAS AT THE SAME LEVEL AS 1999

AND PETROLEUM PRODUCT SALES WERE DOWN ABOUT 4 PERCENT. EARNINGS FROM U.S.

DOWNSTREAM OPERATIONS WERE $1,561 MILLION, UP $984 MILLION FROM THE DEPRESSED

RESULTS OF 1999, REFLECTING STRONGER REFINING MARGINS AND IMPROVED OPERATIONS,

PARTLY OFFSET BY WEAKER MARKETING MARGINS. EARNINGS OUTSIDE THE U.S. OF $1,857

MILLION WERE $1,087 MILLION HIGHER THAN 1999 AFTER EXCLUDING SPECIAL CHARGES IN

1999 IN JAPAN OF $80 MILLION FOR NON-MERGER RELATED RESTRUCTURING OF DOWNSTREAM

OPERATIONS AND A $40 MILLION WRITE-OFF ASSOCIATED WITH THE CANCELLATION OF A

POWER PROJECT. THE IMPROVEMENT WAS DRIVEN BY STRONGER EUROPEAN AND TO A MUCH

LESSER EXTENT SOUTHEAST ASIAN REFINING MARGINS AND IMPROVED REFINING OPERATIONS,

PARTLY OFFSET BY WEAKER MARKETING MARGINS.

CHEMICALS

CHEMICALS EARNINGS TOTALED $1,161 MILLION COMPARED WITH $1,354 MILLION IN 1999.

RECORD PRIME PRODUCT SALES VOLUMES OF 25,637 KT (THOUSANDS OF METRIC TONS) WERE

UP 354 KT. THE DECLINE IN EARNINGS WAS DRIVEN BY HIGHER FEEDSTOCK AND ENERGY

COSTS AND UNFAVORABLE FOREIGN EXCHANGE EFFECTS.

OTHER OPERATIONS

EARNINGS FROM OTHER OPERATING SEGMENTS TOTALED $551 MILLION, AN INCREASE OF $125

MILLION FROM 1999, REFLECTING RECORD COPPER, COAL AND ELECTRICITY SALES, HIGHER

COPPER PRICES, LOWER OPERATING EXPENSES AND FAVORABLE FOREIGN EXCHANGE EFFECTS,

PARTLY OFFSET BY LOWER COAL PRICES.

CORPORATE AND FINANCING

CORPORATE AND FINANCING EXPENSES OF $589 MILLION COMPARED WITH $514 MILLION IN

1999. THE INCREASE RESULTED FROM UNFAVORABLE FOREIGN

21

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS

EXCHANGE EFFECTS AND LOWER TAX-RELATED BENEFITS. PARTLY OFFSETTING WAS A

REDUCTION IN ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES AS A RESULT OF COMBINING EXXON AND MOBIL

HEADQUARTERS OPERATIONS. THE EFFECT OF LOWER DEBT LEVELS WAS PARTLY OFFSET BY

HIGHER INTEREST RATES DURING THE YEAR.

REVIEW OF 1999 RESULTS

EARNINGS EXCLUDING MERGER EXPENSES AND SPECIAL ITEMS WERE $8,380 MILLION, DOWN

$426 MILLION OR 5 PERCENT FROM 1998. NET INCOME WAS $7,910 MILLION, DOWN FROM

$8,074 MILLION IN 1998. THE DECLINE WAS PRIMARILY IN THE DOWNSTREAM WHERE

STEEPLY RISING CRUDE OIL COSTS COULD NOT BE RECOVERED IN THE MARKETPLACE. CRUDE

OIL PRICES ROSE ABOUT $14 PER BARREL FROM JANUARY TO DECEMBER 1999, DEPRESSING

DOWNSTREAM MARGINS IN ALL GEOGRAPHIC AREAS. WEAKER CHEMICALS MARGINS AND LOWER

COAL PRICES ALSO ADVERSELY AFFECTED EARNINGS. HOWEVER, UPSTREAM RESULTS

BENEFITED FROM THE INCREASE IN CRUDE OIL PRICES AND PARTLY OFFSET THE WEAKNESS

IN DOWNSTREAM BUSINESS CONDITIONS. RECORD CHEMICALS, COAL AND COPPER VOLUMES AND

REDUCED EXPENSES IN EVERY OPERATING SEGMENT ALSO BENEFITED EARNINGS. RESULTS IN

1999 INCLUDED $470 MILLION OF NET CHARGES FOR SPECIAL ITEMS -- $469 MILLION OF

MERGER EXPENSES WITH OTHER SPECIAL ITEMS ESSENTIALLY OFFSETTING. RESULTS IN 1998

INCLUDED $732 MILLION OF NET SPECIAL CHARGES. REVENUE FOR 1999 TOTALED $186

BILLION, UP 9 PERCENT FROM 1998, AND THE COST OF CRUDE OIL AND PRODUCT PURCHASES

INCREASED 24 PERCENT.

EXCLUDING MERGER EXPENSES, THE COMBINED TOTAL OF OPERATING COSTS (INCLUDING

OPERATING, SELLING, GENERAL, ADMINISTRATIVE, EXPLORATION, DEPRECIATION AND

DEPLETION EXPENSES FROM THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF INCOME AND EXXONMOBIL'S

SHARE OF SIMILAR COSTS FOR EQUITY COMPANIES) IN 1999 WAS $44.3 BILLION, DOWN

ABOUT $400 MILLION FROM 1998. THE IMPACT OF EFFICIENCY INITIATIVES, INCLUDING

THE CAPTURE OF EARLY MERGER SYNERGIES, REDUCED OPERATING COSTS BY $1.2 BILLION.

INTEREST EXPENSE IN 1999 WAS $695 MILLION, $127 MILLION HIGHER THAN 1998,

MAINLY DUE TO A HIGHER DEBT LEVEL AND UNFAVORABLE FOREIGN EXCHANGE EFFECTS.

UPSTREAM

UPSTREAM EARNINGS OF $5,886 MILLION INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY FROM 1998 REFLECTING

HIGHER AVERAGE CRUDE OIL PRICES, UP OVER $5 PER BARREL FROM 1998. AVERAGE U.S.

NATURAL GAS PRICES WERE 9 PERCENT HIGHER THAN THE PRIOR YEAR, WHILE EUROPEAN GAS

PRICES, WHICH ARE TIED TO PETROLEUM PRODUCT PRICES ON A LAGGED BASIS, WERE ABOUT

17 PERCENT LOWER. LIQUIDS PRODUCTION OF 2,517 KBD WAS UP 1 PERCENT FROM 2,502

KBD IN 1998 AS PRODUCTION FROM NEW DEVELOPMENTS IN THE NORTH SEA, THE GULF OF

MEXICO, WEST AFRICA AND THE CASPIAN OFFSET NATURAL FIELD DECLINES IN NORTH

AMERICA AND LOWER LIFTINGS IN INDONESIA AND MALAYSIA. NATURAL GAS PRODUCTION OF

10,308 MCFD COMPARED WITH 10,617 MCFD IN 1998. UPSTREAM EXPENSES WERE REDUCED

FROM 1998 LEVELS. EARNINGS FROM THE U.S. UPSTREAM WERE $1,842 MILLION, UP $807

MILLION AFTER EXCLUDING $185 MILLION OF SPECIAL CHARGES RELATED MAINLY TO

PROPERTY WRITE-DOWNS IN 1998. OUTSIDE THE U.S. UPSTREAM EARNINGS WERE $3,925

MILLION, UP $1,247 MILLION AFTER EXCLUDING A $141 MILLION DEFERRED TAX BENEFIT

AND A $22 MILLION PROPERTY WRITE-OFF IN 1999 AND $176 MILLION OF OTHER NET

SPECIAL CHARGES IN 1998.

DOWNSTREAM

DOWNSTREAM EARNINGS OF $1,227 MILLION DECLINED FROM 1998'S STRONG RESULTS

PRIMARILY REFLECTING ESCALATING CRUDE OIL COSTS AND WEAKER DOWNSTREAM MARGINS IN

ALL GEOGRAPHIC AREAS. UNFAVORABLE FOREIGN EXCHANGE AND INVENTORY EFFECTS ALSO

REDUCED EARNINGS. HIGHER VOLUMES, MAINLY IN THE U.S., AND LOWER OPERATING

EXPENSES PROVIDED A PARTIAL OFFSET. PETROLEUM PRODUCT SALES WERE 8,887 KBD

COMPARED WITH 8,873 KBD IN 1998. REFINERY THROUGHPUT WAS 5,977 KBD COMPARED WITH

6,093 KBD IN 1998. IN THE U.S., DOWNSTREAM EARNINGS WERE $577 MILLION, DOWN $614

MILLION FROM 1998 AFTER EXCLUDING $8 MILLION OF SPECIAL CREDITS RELATED TO

INVENTORY ADJUSTMENTS IN 1998. DOWNSTREAM OPERATIONS OUTSIDE OF THE U.S. EARNED

$770 MILLION, DOWN $1,917 MILLION FROM 1998 AFTER EXCLUDING SPECIAL CHARGES FROM

BOTH YEARS. RESULTS IN 1999 INCLUDED $80 MILLION OF CHARGES FOR NON-MERGER

RELATED RESTRUCTURING OF JAPANESE DOWNSTREAM OPERATIONS AND A $40 MILLION WRITE-

OFF ASSOCIATED WITH THE CANCELLATION OF A POWER PROJECT IN JAPAN, WHILE 1998

RESULTS INCLUDED $412 MILLION OF SPECIAL CHARGES LARGELY RELATED TO THE IMPACT

OF LOWER PRICES ON INVENTORIES AND MOBIL-BRITISH PETROLEUM (BP) ALLIANCE

IMPLEMENTATION COSTS.

CHEMICALS

EARNINGS FROM CHEMICALS OPERATIONS TOTALED $1,354 MILLION, DOWN $40 MILLION OR 3

PERCENT FROM 1998. INDUSTRY MARGINS DECLINED DUE TO LOWER PRODUCT PRICES AND

HIGHER FEEDSTOCK COSTS. PRIME PRODUCT SALES VOLUMES OF 25,283 KT WERE A RECORD.

EARNINGS ALSO BENEFITED FROM LOWER OPERATING EXPENSES. CHEMICALS' RESULTS

INCLUDED $9 MILLION OF SPECIAL CHARGES RELATED TO THE IMPACT OF LOWER PRICES ON

INVENTORIES IN 1998.

OTHER OPERATIONS

EARNINGS FROM OTHER OPERATING SEGMENTS TOTALED $426 MILLION, AN INCREASE OF $42

MILLION FROM 1998. THE INCREASE REFLECTS RECORD COPPER AND COAL PRODUCTION,

LOWER OPERATING EXPENSES AND FAVORABLE FOREIGN EXCHANGE EFFECTS, PARTLY OFFSET

BY DEPRESSED COAL PRICES.

CORPORATE AND FINANCING

CORPORATE AND FINANCING EXPENSES WERE $514 MILLION, $54 MILLION HIGHER THAN 1998

WHICH INCLUDED A NET SPECIAL CREDIT OF $112 MILLION RELATED TO SETTLEMENT OF

PRIOR YEARS' TAX DISPUTES. EXCLUDING SPECIAL ITEMS, EXPENSES WERE $58 MILLION

LOWER REFLECTING LOWER TAX-RELATED CHARGES.

MERGER OF EXXON CORPORATION AND MOBIL CORPORATION

ON NOVEMBER 30, 1999, A WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARY OF EXXON CORPORATION (EXXON)

MERGED WITH MOBIL CORPORATION (MOBIL) SO THAT MOBIL BECAME A WHOLLY-OWNED

SUBSIDIARY OF EXXON (THE "MERGER"). AT THE SAME TIME, EXXON CHANGED ITS NAME TO

EXXON MOBIL CORPORATION (EXXONMOBIL). UNDER THE TERMS OF THE AGREEMENT,

APPROXIMATELY 1.0 BILLION SHARES OF EXXONMOBIL COMMON STOCK WERE ISSUED IN

EXCHANGE FOR ALL THE OUTSTANDING SHARES OF MOBIL COMMON STOCK BASED UPON AN

EXCHANGE RATIO OF 1.32015. FOLLOWING THE EXCHANGE, FORMER SHAREHOLDERS OF EXXON

OWNED APPROXIMATELY 70 PERCENT OF THE CORPORATION, WHILE FORMER MOBIL

SHAREHOLDERS OWNED APPROXIMATELY 30 PERCENT OF THE CORPORATION. EACH OUTSTANDING

SHARE OF MOBIL PREFERRED STOCK WAS CONVERTED INTO ONE SHARE OF A NEW CLASS OF

EXXONMOBIL PREFERRED STOCK.

AS A RESULT OF THE MERGER, THE ACCOUNTS OF CERTAIN DOWNSTREAM AND CHEMICALS

OPERATIONS JOINTLY CONTROLLED BY THE COMBINING COMPANIES HAVE BEEN INCLUDED IN

THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. THESE OPERATIONS WERE PREVIOUSLY

ACCOUNTED FOR BY EXXON AND MOBIL AS SEPARATE COMPANIES USING THE EQUITY METHOD

OF ACCOUNTING.

22

THE MERGER WAS ACCOUNTED FOR AS A POOLING OF INTERESTS. ACCORDINGLY, THE

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GIVE RETROACTIVE EFFECT TO THE MERGER, WITH

ALL PERIODS PRESENTED AS IF EXXON AND MOBIL HAD ALWAYS BEEN COMBINED.

AS A CONDITION OF THE APPROVAL OF THE MERGER, THE U.S. FEDERAL TRADE

COMMISSION AND THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION REQUIRED THAT CERTAIN PROPERTY --

PRIMARILY DOWNSTREAM, PIPELINE AND NATURAL GAS DISTRIBUTION ASSETS -- BE

DIVESTED. THESE ASSETS, WITH A CARRYING VALUE OF APPROXIMATELY $3 BILLION, WERE

SOLD IN THE YEAR 2000. BEFORE-TAX PROCEEDS FOR THESE ASSETS WERE APPROXIMATELY

$5 BILLION. THE NET AFTER-TAX GAIN OF $1,730 MILLION WAS REPORTED AS AN

EXTRAORDINARY ITEM CONSISTENT WITH POOLING OF INTERESTS ACCOUNTING

REQUIREMENTS. THE PROPERTIES HAVE HISTORICALLY EARNED APPROXIMATELY $200

MILLION PER YEAR.

REORGANIZATION COSTS

IN ASSOCIATION WITH THE MERGER BETWEEN EXXON AND MOBIL, $1,406 MILLION PRE-TAX

($920 MILLION AFTER-TAX) AND $625 MILLION PRE-TAX ($469 MILLION AFTER-TAX) OF

COSTS WERE RECORDED AS MERGER RELATED EXPENSES IN 2000 AND 1999, RESPECTIVELY.

CUMULATIVE CHARGES INCLUDED SEPARATION EXPENSES RELATED TO WORKFORCE REDUCTIONS

(APPROXIMATELY 6,000 EMPLOYEES AT YEAR-END 2000) AND MERGER CLOSING AND

IMPLEMENTATION COSTS. THE SEPARATION RESERVE BALANCE AT YEAR-END 2000 OF

APPROXIMATELY $320 MILLION IS EXPECTED TO BE EXPENDED IN 2001. MERGER RELATED

EXPENSES ARE EXPECTED TO GROW TO APPROXIMATELY $2.5 BILLION PRE-TAX ON A

CUMULATIVE BASIS BY 2002. PRE-TAX OPERATING SYNERGIES ASSOCIATED WITH THE

MERGER, WHICH ARE ON TRACK WITH EXPECTATIONS, INCLUDING COST SAVINGS, EFFICIENCY

GAINS, AND REVENUE ENHANCEMENTS, ARE EXPECTED TO REACH $4.6 BILLION PER YEAR BY

2002.

IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 1999 THE CORPORATION RECORDED A $120 MILLION AFTER-

TAX CHARGE FOR THE REORGANIZATION OF JAPANESE DOWNSTREAM OPERATIONS IN ITS

WHOLLY-OWNED ESSO SEKIYU K.K. AND 50.1 PERCENT OWNED GENERAL SEKIYU K.K.

AFFILIATES. THE REORGANIZATION RESULTED IN THE REDUCTION OF APPROXIMATELY 700

ADMINISTRATIVE, FINANCIAL, LOGISTICS AND MARKETING SERVICE EMPLOYEE POSITIONS.

THE JAPANESE AFFILIATES RECORDED A COMBINED CHARGE OF $216 MILLION (BEFORE-TAX)

TO SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES FOR THE EMPLOYEE RELATED COSTS.

SUBSTANTIALLY ALL CASH EXPENDITURES ANTICIPATED IN THE RESTRUCTURING PROVISION

HAVE BEEN PAID AS OF THE END OF 1999. GENERAL SEKIYU ALSO RECORDED A $211

MILLION (BEFORE-TAX) CHARGE TO DEPRECIATION AND DEPLETION FOR THE WRITE-OFF OF

COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE CANCELLATION OF A POWER PLANT PROJECT AT THE KAWASAKI

TERMINAL. MANPOWER REDUCTION SAVINGS ASSOCIATED WITH THIS REORGANIZATION ARE

APPROXIMATELY $50 MILLION PER YEAR AFTER-TAX IN 2000.

AS INDICATED IN NOTE 4, DURING 1998 MOBIL IMPLEMENTED REORGANIZATION PROGRAMS

IN AUSTRALIA, NEW ZEALAND AND LATIN AMERICA TO INTEGRATE REGIONAL FUELS AND

LUBES OPERATIONS. IN 1997, MOBIL AND BP ANNOUNCED THAT THEIR EUROPEAN

DOWNSTREAM ALLIANCE WOULD IMPLEMENT A MAJOR REORGANIZATION OF ITS LUBRICANT

BASE OIL REFINING BUSINESS. ALSO IN 1997, MOBIL COMMENCED TWO MAJOR COST

SAVINGS INITIATIVES IN ASIA-PACIFIC: ONE IN JAPAN IN RESPONSE TO THE

DEREGULATED BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT AND THE OTHER IN AUSTRALIA. AFTER-TAX COSTS

FOR PROGRAMS INITIATED IN 1998 WERE $41 MILLION AND FOR THE 1997 PROGRAMS WERE

$189 MILLION. BENEFITS ASSOCIATED WITH THESE UNDERTAKINGS ARE ESTIMATED AT $140

MILLION PER YEAR AFTER-TAX.

THE FOLLOWING TABLE SUMMARIZES THE ACTIVITY IN THE REORGANIZATION RESERVES.

CAPITAL AND EXPLORATION EXPENDITURES

CAPITAL AND EXPLORATION EXPENDITURES IN 2000 WERE $11.2 BILLION, DOWN FROM $13.3

BILLION IN 1999, PRIMARILY REFLECTING TIMING OF COMPLETION OF MAJOR PROJECT

EXPENDITURES.

UPSTREAM SPENDING WAS DOWN 18 PERCENT TO $6.9 BILLION IN 2000, FROM $8.4

BILLION IN 1999, AS A RESULT OF THE COMPLETION OF MAJOR PROJECTS IN THE NORTH

SEA, CANADA AND SOUTH AMERICA, AND LOWER EXPLORATION EXPENSES. CAPITAL

INVESTMENTS IN THE DOWNSTREAM TOTALED $2.6 BILLION IN 2000, UP $0.2 BILLION

FROM 1999, PRIMARILY REFLECTING INCREASED INVESTMENTS IN CHINA AND HIGHER

SPENDING AT U.S. REFINERIES. THE INCREASE WAS LARGELY OFFSET BY LOWER SPENDING

IN THE EUROPEAN FUELS JOINT VENTURE WITH BP WHICH WAS DIVESTED IN 2000 AS A

CONDITION OF REGULATORY APPROVAL OF THE MERGER, AND LOWER SPENDING IN THE

RETAIL BUSINESSES. CHEMICALS CAPITAL EXPENDITURES WERE $1.5 BILLION IN 2000,

DOWN FROM $2.2 BILLION IN 1999, DUE TO THE COMPLETION OF MAJOR PROJECTS IN THE

UNITED STATES, SINGAPORE, SAUDI ARABIA, AND THAILAND.

CAPITAL AND EXPLORATION EXPENDITURES IN THE U.S. TOTALED $3.3 BILLION IN

2000, A DECREASE OF $0.1 BILLION FROM 1999, REFLECTING HIGHER SPENDING IN BOTH

THE UPSTREAM AND DOWNSTREAM, OFFSET BY LOWER SPENDING IN CHEMICALS. SPENDING

OUTSIDE THE U.S. OF $7.9 BILLION IN 2000 COMPARED WITH $9.9 BILLION IN 1999,

REFLECTING LOWER EXPENDITURES IN THE UPSTREAM AND CHEMICALS.

FIRM COMMITMENTS RELATED TO CAPITAL PROJECTS TOTALED APPROXIMATELY $4.6

BILLION AT THE END OF 2000, THE SAME AS AT YEAR-END 1999. THE LARGEST SINGLE

COMMITMENT IN 2000 WAS $2.3 BILLION ASSOCIATED WITH THE DEVELOPMENT OF CRUDE

OIL AND NATURAL GAS RESOURCES IN MALAYSIA. THE CORPORATION EXPECTS TO FUND THE

MAJORITY OF THESE COMMITMENTS THROUGH INTERNALLY GENERATED FUNDS.

MARKET RISKS, INFLATION AND OTHER UNCERTAINTIES

IN THE PAST, CRUDE, PRODUCT AND CHEMICAL PRICES HAVE FLUCTUATED WIDELY IN

RESPONSE TO CHANGING MARKET FORCES. THE IMPACTS OF THESE PRICE FLUCTUATIONS ON

EARNINGS FROM UPSTREAM OPERATIONS, DOWNSTREAM OPERATIONS AND CHEMICAL OPERATIONS

HAVE BEEN VARIED, TENDING AT TIMES TO BE OFFSETTING.

THE MARKETS FOR CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS HAVE A HISTORY OF SIGNIFICANT PRICE

VOLATILITY. ALTHOUGH PRICES WILL OCCASIONALLY DROP PRECIPITOUSLY, INDUSTRY

PRICES OVER THE LONG TERM WILL CONTINUE TO BE DRIVEN BY MARKET SUPPLY AND

DEMAND FUNDAMENTALS. ACCORDINGLY, THE CORPORATION TESTS THE VIABILITY OF ITS

OIL AND GAS OPERATIONS BASED ON LONG-TERM PRICE PROJECTIONS. THE CORPORATION'S

ASSESSMENT IS THAT ITS OPERATIONS WILL

23

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS

CONTINUE TO BE SUCCESSFUL IN A VARIETY OF MARKET CONDITIONS. THIS IS THE

OUTCOME OF DISCIPLINED INVESTMENT AND ASSET MANAGEMENT PROGRAMS.

INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES ARE TESTED AGAINST A VARIETY OF MARKET CONDITIONS,

INCLUDING LOW PRICE SCENARIOS. AS A RESULT, INVESTMENTS THAT WOULD SUCCEED ONLY

IN HIGHLY FAVORABLE PRICE ENVIRONMENTS ARE SCREENED OUT OF THE INVESTMENT PLAN.

IN ADDITION, THE CORPORATION HAS HAD AN AGGRESSIVE ASSET MANAGEMENT PROGRAM IN

WHICH UNDER-PERFORMING ASSETS ARE EITHER IMPROVED TO ACCEPTABLE LEVELS OR

CONSIDERED FOR DIVESTMENT. THE ASSET MANAGEMENT PROGRAM INVOLVES A DISCIPLINED,

REGULAR REVIEW TO ENSURE THAT ALL ASSETS ARE CONTRIBUTING TO THE CORPORATION'S

STRATEGIC AND FINANCIAL OBJECTIVES. THE RESULT HAS BEEN THE CREATION OF A VERY

EFFICIENT CAPITAL BASE.

RISK MANAGEMENT

THE CORPORATION'S SIZE, GEOGRAPHIC DIVERSITY AND THE COMPLEMENTARY NATURE OF THE

UPSTREAM, DOWNSTREAM AND CHEMICALS BUSINESSES MITIGATE THE CORPORATION'S RISK

FROM CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES, CURRENCY RATES AND COMMODITY PRICES. AS A

RESULT, THE CORPORATION MAKES LIMITED USE OF DERIVATIVES TO OFFSET EXPOSURES

ARISING FROM EXISTING TRANSACTIONS.

INTEREST RATE, FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATE AND COMMODITY PRICE EXPOSURES FROM THE

CONTRACTS UNDERTAKEN IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE CORPORATION'S POLICIES HAVE NOT

BEEN SIGNIFICANT. DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS ARE NOT HELD FOR TRADING PURPOSES NOR

DO THEY HAVE LEVERAGED FEATURES.

DEBT-RELATED INSTRUMENTS

THE CORPORATION IS EXPOSED TO CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES, PRIMARILY AS A RESULT

OF ITS SHORT-TERM AND LONG-TERM DEBT WITH BOTH FIXED AND FLOATING INTEREST

RATES. THE CORPORATION MAKES LIMITED USE OF INTEREST RATE SWAP AGREEMENTS TO

ADJUST THE RATIO OF FIXED AND FLOATING RATES IN THE DEBT PORTFOLIO. THE IMPACT

OF A 100 BASIS POINT CHANGE IN INTEREST RATES AFFECTING THE CORPORATION'S DEBT

WOULD NOT BE MATERIAL TO EARNINGS, CASH FLOW OR FAIR VALUE.

FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE INSTRUMENTS

THE CORPORATION CONDUCTS BUSINESS IN MANY FOREIGN CURRENCIES AND IS SUBJECT TO

FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE RISK ON CASH FLOWS RELATED TO SALES, EXPENSES,

FINANCING AND INVESTMENT TRANSACTIONS. THE IMPACTS OF FLUCTUATIONS IN FOREIGN

CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES ON EXXONMOBIL'S GEOGRAPHICALLY DIVERSE OPERATIONS ARE

VARIED AND OFTEN OFFSETTING IN AMOUNT. THE CORPORATION MAKES LIMITED USE OF

CURRENCY EXCHANGE CONTRACTS TO REDUCE THE RISK OF ADVERSE FOREIGN CURRENCY

MOVEMENTS RELATED TO CERTAIN FOREIGN CURRENCY DEBT OBLIGATIONS. EXPOSURE FROM

MARKET RATE FLUCTUATIONS RELATED TO THESE CONTRACTS IS NOT MATERIAL. AGGREGATE

FOREIGN EXCHANGE TRANSACTION GAINS AND LOSSES INCLUDED IN NET INCOME ARE

DISCUSSED IN NOTE 5 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

COMMODITY INSTRUMENTS

THE CORPORATION MAKES LIMITED USE OF COMMODITY FORWARDS, SWAPS AND FUTURES

CONTRACTS OF SHORT DURATION TO MITIGATE THE RISK OF UNFAVORABLE PRICE MOVEMENTS

ON CERTAIN CRUDE, NATURAL GAS AND PETROLEUM PRODUCT PURCHASES AND SALES.

COMMODITY PRICE EXPOSURE RELATED TO THESE CONTRACTS IS NOT MATERIAL.

INFLATION AND OTHER UNCERTAINTIES

THE GENERAL RATE OF INFLATION IN MOST MAJOR COUNTRIES OF OPERATION HAS BEEN

RELATIVELY LOW IN RECENT YEARS, AND THE ASSOCIATED IMPACT ON OPERATING COSTS HAS

BEEN COUNTERED BY COST REDUCTIONS FROM EFFICIENCY AND PRODUCTIVITY IMPROVEMENTS.

THE OPERATIONS AND EARNINGS OF THE CORPORATION AND ITS AFFILIATES THROUGHOUT

THE WORLD HAVE BEEN, AND MAY IN THE FUTURE BE, AFFECTED FROM TIME TO TIME IN

VARYING DEGREE BY POLITICAL DEVELOPMENTS AND LAWS AND REGULATIONS, SUCH AS

FORCED DIVESTITURE OF ASSETS; RESTRICTIONS ON PRODUCTION, IMPORTS AND EXPORTS;

PRICE CONTROLS; TAX INCREASES AND RETROACTIVE TAX CLAIMS; EXPROPRIATION OF

PROPERTY; CANCELLATION OF CONTRACT RIGHTS AND ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS. BOTH

THE LIKELIHOOD OF SUCH OCCURRENCES AND THEIR OVERALL EFFECT UPON THE

CORPORATION VARY GREATLY FROM COUNTRY TO COUNTRY AND ARE NOT PREDICTABLE.

RECENTLY ISSUED STATEMENTS

OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

IN JUNE 1998, THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD RELEASED STATEMENT NO.

133, "ACCOUNTING FOR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES." STATEMENT

NO. 133, AS AMENDED BY STATEMENTS NO. 137 AND 138, MUST BE ADOPTED BY THE

CORPORATION NO LATER THAN JANUARY 1, 2001. THE STATEMENT ESTABLISHES ACCOUNTING

AND REPORTING STANDARDS FOR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS. IT REQUIRES THAT ALL

DERIVATIVES BE RECOGNIZED AS EITHER ASSETS OR LIABILITIES IN THE FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS AND MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE. IT ESTABLISHES THE ACCOUNTING FOR CHANGES

IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE DERIVATIVES DEPENDING ON THEIR INTENDED USE. SINCE THE

CORPORATION MAKES VERY LIMITED USE OF DERIVATIVES, THE EFFECT OF ADOPTION ON THE

CORPORATION'S OPERATIONS OR FINANCIAL CONDITION WILL BE NEGLIGIBLE.

SITE RESTORATION AND OTHER ENVIRONMENTAL COSTS

OVER THE YEARS THE CORPORATION HAS ACCRUED PROVISIONS FOR ESTIMATED SITE

RESTORATION COSTS TO BE INCURRED AT THE END OF THE OPERATING LIFE OF CERTAIN OF

ITS FACILITIES AND PROPERTIES. IN ADDITION, THE CORPORATION ACCRUES PROVISIONS

FOR ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES IN THE MANY COUNTRIES IN WHICH IT DOES BUSINESS

WHEN IT IS PROBABLE THAT OBLIGATIONS HAVE BEEN INCURRED AND THE AMOUNTS CAN BE

REASONABLY ESTIMATED. THIS POLICY APPLIES TO ASSETS OR BUSINESSES CURRENTLY

OWNED OR PREVIOUSLY DISPOSED.

THE CORPORATION HAS ACCRUED PROVISIONS FOR PROBABLE ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION

OBLIGATIONS AT VARIOUS SITES, INCLUDING MULTI-PARTY SITES WHERE EXXONMOBIL HAS

BEEN IDENTIFIED AS ONE OF THE POTENTIALLY RESPONSIBLE PARTIES BY THE U.S.

ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY. THE INVOLVEMENT OF OTHER FINANCIALLY

RESPONSIBLE COMPANIES AT THESE MULTI-PARTY SITES MITIGATES EXXONMOBIL'S ACTUAL

JOINT AND SEVERAL LIABILITY EXPOSURE. AT PRESENT, NO INDIVIDUAL SITE IS

EXPECTED TO HAVE LOSSES MATERIAL TO EXXONMOBIL'S OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL

CONDITION OR LIQUIDITY.

CHARGES MADE AGAINST INCOME FOR SITE RESTORATION AND ENVIRONMENTAL

LIABILITIES WERE $311 MILLION IN 2000, $219 MILLION IN 1999 AND $240 MILLION IN

1998. AT THE END OF 2000, ACCUMULATED SITE RESTORATION AND ENVIRONMENTAL

PROVISIONS, AFTER REDUCTION FOR AMOUNTS PAID, AMOUNTED TO $3.7 BILLION.

EXXONMOBIL BELIEVES THAT ANY COST IN EXCESS OF THE AMOUNTS ALREADY PROVIDED FOR

IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS WOULD NOT HAVE A MATERIALLY ADVERSE EFFECT UPON THE

CORPORATION'S OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL CONDITION OR LIQUIDITY.

24

IN 2000, THE CORPORATION SPENT $1,529 MILLION (OF WHICH $393 MILLION WERE

CAPITAL EXPENDITURES) ON ENVIRONMENTAL PROJECTS AND EXPENSES WORLDWIDE, MOSTLY

DEALING WITH AIR AND WATER CONSERVATION. TOTAL EXPENDITURES FOR SUCH ACTIVITIES

ARE EXPECTED TO BE ABOUT $1.8 BILLION IN BOTH 2001 AND 2002 (WITH CAPITAL

EXPENDITURES REPRESENTING ABOUT 25 PERCENT OF THE TOTAL).

TAXES

INCOME, EXCISE AND ALL OTHER TAXES AND DUTIES TOTALED $68.4 BILLION IN 2000, AN

INCREASE OF $6.9 BILLION OR 11 PERCENT FROM 1999. INCOME TAX EXPENSE, BOTH

CURRENT AND DEFERRED, WAS $11.1 BILLION COMPARED TO $3.2 BILLION IN 1999,

REFLECTING HIGHER PRE-TAX INCOME IN 2000. THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE INCREASED FROM

31.8 PERCENT IN 1999 TO 42.4 PERCENT IN 2000 AS A RESULT OF A LARGER SHARE OF

TOTAL EARNINGS COMING FROM THE MORE HIGHLY TAXED NON-U.S. UPSTREAM SEGMENT AND

LOWER BENEFITS FROM RESOLUTION OF TAX-RELATED ISSUES. EXCISE AND ALL OTHER TAXES

AND DUTIES DECREASED $1.0 BILLION TO $57.3 BILLION.

INCOME, EXCISE AND ALL OTHER TAXES AND DUTIES TOTALED $61.5 BILLION IN 1999,

AN INCREASE OF $1.6 BILLION OR 3 PERCENT FROM 1998. INCOME TAX EXPENSE, BOTH

CURRENT AND DEFERRED, WAS $3.2 BILLION COMPARED TO $3.9 BILLION IN 1998,

REFLECTING LOWER PRE-TAX INCOME IN 1999, THE IMPACT OF LOWER FOREIGN TAX RATES

AND FAVORABLE RESOLUTION OF TAX-RELATED ISSUES. THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE WAS 31.8

PERCENT IN 1999 VERSUS 35.2 PERCENT IN 1998. EXCISE AND ALL OTHER TAXES AND

DUTIES INCREASED $2.3 BILLION TO $58.3 BILLION, REFLECTING HIGHER PRICES.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

IN 2000, CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES TOTALED $22.9 BILLION, UP $7.9

BILLION FROM 1999. MAJOR SOURCES OF FUNDS WERE NET INCOME OF $17.7 BILLION AND

NON-CASH PROVISIONS OF $8.1 BILLION FOR DEPRECIATION AND DEPLETION.

CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES TOTALED $3.3 BILLION, DOWN $7.7 BILLION

FROM 1999 DUE TO HIGHER PROCEEDS FROM SALES OF SUBSIDIARIES, INVESTMENTS AND

PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT RESULTING FROM ASSET DIVESTITURES THAT WERE

REQUIRED AS A CONDITION OF THE REGULATORY APPROVAL OF THE MERGER, AND DUE TO

LOWER ADDITIONS TO PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT.

CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES WAS $14.2 BILLION, UP $9.4 BILLION, DRIVEN

BY DEBT REDUCTIONS IN THE CURRENT YEAR VERSUS DEBT INCREASES IN 1999, ALONG

WITH HIGHER PURCHASES OF COMMON SHARES. DIVIDEND PAYMENTS ON COMMON SHARES

INCREASED FROM $1.687 PER SHARE TO $1.760 PER SHARE AND TOTALED $6.1 BILLION, A

PAYOUT OF 35 PERCENT. TOTAL CONSOLIDATED DEBT DECLINED BY $5.6 BILLION TO $13.4

BILLION.

SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY INCREASED BY $7.3 BILLION TO $70.8 BILLION. THE RATIO OF

DEBT TO CAPITAL DECREASED TO 15 PERCENT, REFLECTING LOWER DEBT LEVELS AND THE

HIGHER SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY BALANCE.

PRIOR TO THE MERGER, THE CORPORATION PURCHASED SHARES OF ITS COMMON STOCK FOR

THE TREASURY. CONSISTENT WITH POOLING ACCOUNTING REQUIREMENTS, THIS REPURCHASE

PROGRAM WAS TERMINATED EFFECTIVE WITH THE CLOSE OF THE EXXONMOBIL MERGER ON

NOVEMBER 30, 1999. ON AUGUST 1, 2000, THE CORPORATION ANNOUNCED ITS INTENTION

TO PURCHASE SHARES OF ITS COMMON STOCK. DURING 2000, EXXON MOBIL CORPORATION

PURCHASED 27.0 MILLION SHARES OF ITS COMMON STOCK FOR THE TREASURY AT A GROSS

COST OF $2,352 MILLION. THESE PURCHASES WERE TO OFFSET SHARES ISSUED IN

CONJUNCTION WITH COMPANY BENEFIT PLANS AND PROGRAMS AND TO REDUCE THE NUMBER OF

SHARES OUTSTANDING. SHARES OUTSTANDING WERE REDUCED FROM 3,477 MILLION AT THE

END OF 1999 TO 3,465 MILLION AT THE END OF 2000. PURCHASES WERE MADE IN BOTH

THE OPEN MARKET AND THROUGH NEGOTIATED TRANSACTIONS, AND MAY BE DISCONTINUED AT

ANY TIME.

IN 1999, CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES TOTALED $15.0 BILLION, DOWN

$1.4 BILLION FROM 1998. MAJOR SOURCES OF FUNDS WERE NET INCOME OF $7.9 BILLION

AND NON-CASH PROVISIONS OF $8.3 BILLION FOR DEPRECIATION AND DEPLETION.

CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES TOTALED $11.0 BILLION, DOWN $1.0 BILLION

FROM 1998 PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF LOWER ADDITIONS TO PROPERTY, PLANT AND

EQUIPMENT, PARTLY OFFSET BY LOWER SALES OF SUBSIDIARIES AND PROPERTY, PLANT AND

EQUIPMENT.

CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES WAS $4.8 BILLION, DOWN $2.4 BILLION,

PRIMARILY DUE TO FEWER COMMON SHARE PURCHASES. DIVIDEND PAYMENTS ON COMMON

SHARES INCREASED FROM $1.666 PER SHARE TO $1.687 PER SHARE AND TOTALED $5.8

BILLION, A PAYOUT OF 74 PERCENT. TOTAL CONSOLIDATED DEBT INCREASED BY $2.0

BILLION TO $19.0 BILLION.

SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY INCREASED BY $1.3 BILLION TO $63.5 BILLION. THE RATIO OF

DEBT TO CAPITAL INCREASED TO 22 PERCENT, REFLECTING HIGHER DEBT LEVELS. DURING

1999, EXXON PURCHASED 8.3 MILLION SHARES OF ITS COMMON STOCK FOR THE TREASURY

AT A COST OF $648 MILLION. THESE PURCHASES WERE USED TO OFFSET SHARES ISSUED IN

CONJUNCTION WITH THE COMPANY'S BENEFIT PLANS AND PROGRAMS. PURCHASES WERE MADE

BOTH IN THE OPEN MARKET AND THROUGH NEGOTIATED TRANSACTIONS. CONSISTENT WITH

POOLING OF INTEREST ACCOUNTING REQUIREMENTS, THESE REPURCHASES WERE TERMINATED

EFFECTIVE WITH THE CLOSE OF THE EXXONMOBIL MERGER ON NOVEMBER 30, 1999.

PREVIOUSLY, AS A CONSEQUENCE OF THE THEN PROPOSED MERGER OF EXXON AND MOBIL

ANNOUNCED ON DECEMBER 1, 1998, BOTH COMPANIES' REPURCHASE PROGRAMS TO REDUCE

THE NUMBER OF SHARES OUTSTANDING WERE DISCONTINUED.

ALTHOUGH THE CORPORATION ISSUES LONG-TERM DEBT FROM TIME TO TIME AND

MAINTAINS A REVOLVING COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAM, INTERNALLY GENERATED FUNDS

COVER THE MAJORITY OF ITS FINANCIAL REQUIREMENTS.

AS DISCUSSED IN NOTE 14 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, THE

CORPORATION'S FINANCIAL DERIVATIVE ACTIVITIES ARE LIMITED TO SIMPLE RISK

MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES. THE CORPORATION DOES NOT TRADE IN FINANCIAL DERIVATIVES

NOR DOES IT USE FINANCIAL DERIVATIVES WITH LEVERAGED FEATURES. THE CORPORATION

MAINTAINS A SYSTEM OF CONTROLS THAT INCLUDES A POLICY COVERING THE

AUTHORIZATION, REPORTING, AND MONITORING OF DERIVATIVE ACTIVITY. THE

CORPORATION'S DERIVATIVE ACTIVITIES POSE NO MATERIAL CREDIT OR MARKET RISKS TO

EXXONMOBIL'S OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL CONDITION OR LIQUIDITY.

LITIGATION AND OTHER CONTINGENCIES

AS DISCUSSED IN NOTE 17 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, A NUMBER OF

LAWSUITS, INCLUDING CLASS ACTIONS, WERE BROUGHT IN VARIOUS COURTS AGAINST EXXON

MOBIL CORPORATION AND CERTAIN OF ITS SUBSIDIARIES RELATING TO THE ACCIDENTAL

RELEASE OF CRUDE OIL FROM THE TANKER EXXON VALDEZ IN 1989. ESSENTIALLY ALL OF

THESE LAWSUITS HAVE NOW BEEN RESOLVED OR ARE SUBJECT TO APPEAL.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS

ON SEPTEMBER 24, 1996, THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF

ALASKA ENTERED A JUDGMENT IN THE AMOUNT OF $5.058 BILLION IN THE EXXON VALDEZ

CIVIL TRIAL THAT BEGAN IN MAY 1994. THE DISTRICT COURT AWARDED APPROXIMATELY

$19.6 MILLION IN COMPENSATORY DAMAGES TO FISHER PLAINTIFFS, $38 MILLION IN

PREJUDGMENT INTEREST ON THE COMPENSATORY DAMAGES AND $5 BILLION IN PUNITIVE

DAMAGES TO A CLASS COMPOSED OF ALL PERSONS AND ENTITIES WHO ASSERTED CLAIMS FOR

PUNITIVE DAMAGES FROM THE CORPORATION AS A RESULT OF THE EXXON VALDEZ GROUNDING.

THE DISTRICT COURT ALSO ORDERED THAT THESE AWARDS SHALL BEAR INTEREST FROM AND

AFTER ENTRY OF THE JUDGMENT. THE DISTRICT COURT STAYED EXECUTION ON THE JUDGMENT

PENDING APPEAL BASED ON A $6.75 BILLION LETTER OF CREDIT POSTED BY THE

CORPORATION. EXXONMOBIL HAS APPEALED THE JUDGMENT. THE UNITED STATES COURT OF

APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT HEARD ORAL ARGUMENTS ON THE APPEAL ON MAY 3, 1999.

THE CORPORATION CONTINUES TO BELIEVE THAT THE PUNITIVE DAMAGES IN THIS CASE ARE

UNWARRANTED AND THAT THE JUDGMENT SHOULD BE SET ASIDE OR SUBSTANTIALLY REDUCED

BY THE APPELLATE COURTS. THE ULTIMATE COST TO THE CORPORATION FROM THE LAWSUITS

ARISING FROM THE EXXON VALDEZ GROUNDING IS NOT POSSIBLE TO PREDICT AND MAY NOT

BE RESOLVED FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS.

ON DECEMBER 19, 2000, A JURY IN MONTGOMERY COUNTY, ALABAMA, RETURNED A

VERDICT AGAINST THE CORPORATION IN A CONTRACT DISPUTE OVER ROYALTIES IN THE

AMOUNT OF $87.69 MILLION IN COMPENSATORY DAMAGES AND $3.42 BILLION IN PUNITIVE

DAMAGES IN THE CASE OF EXXON CORPORATION V. STATE OF ALABAMA, ET AL. EXXONMOBIL

WILL CHALLENGE THE VERDICT AND BELIEVES THAT THE VERDICT IS UNWARRANTED AND

THAT THE JUDGMENT SHOULD BE SET ASIDE OR SUBSTANTIALLY REDUCED. THE ULTIMATE

OUTCOME IS NOT EXPECTED TO HAVE A MATERIALLY ADVERSE EFFECT UPON THE

CORPORATION'S OPERATIONS OR FINANCIAL CONDITION.

THE U.S. TAX COURT HAS DECIDED THE ISSUE WITH RESPECT TO THE PRICING OF CRUDE

OIL PURCHASED FROM SAUDI ARABIA FOR THE YEARS 1979-1981 IN FAVOR OF THE

CORPORATION. THIS DECISION IS SUBJECT TO APPEAL. CERTAIN OTHER ISSUES FOR THE

YEARS 1979-1993 REMAIN PENDING BEFORE THE TAX COURT. ULTIMATE RESOLUTION OF

THESE ISSUES AND SEVERAL OTHER TAX AND LEGAL ISSUES, NOTABLY FINAL RESOLUTION

OF ROYALTY RECOVERY AND TAX ISSUES RELATED TO THE GAS LIFTING IMBALANCE IN THE

COMMON AREA (ALONG THE GERMAN/DUTCH BORDER), IS NOT EXPECTED TO HAVE A

MATERIALLY ADVERSE EFFECT UPON THE CORPORATION'S OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL

CONDITION OR LIQUIDITY.

THERE ARE NO EVENTS OR UNCERTAINTIES KNOWN TO MANAGEMENT BEYOND THOSE ALREADY

INCLUDED IN REPORTED FINANCIAL INFORMATION THAT WOULD INDICATE A MATERIAL

CHANGE IN FUTURE OPERATING RESULTS OR FINANCIAL CONDITION.

THE EURO

ON JANUARY 1, 1999, ELEVEN EUROPEAN COUNTRIES ESTABLISHED FIXED CONVERSION RATES

BETWEEN THEIR EXISTING SOVEREIGN CURRENCIES ("LEGACY CURRENCIES") AND ADOPTED

THE EURO AS THEIR COMMON LEGAL CURRENCY. THE EURO AND THE LEGACY CURRENCIES ARE

EACH LEGAL TENDER FOR TRANSACTIONS NOW. BEGINNING JANUARY 1, 2002, THE

PARTICIPATING COUNTRIES WILL ISSUE EURO-DENOMINATED BILLS AND COINS. BY JULY 1,

2002 EACH COUNTRY WILL WITHDRAW ITS SOVEREIGN CURRENCY AND TRANSACTIONS

THEREAFTER WILL BE CONDUCTED SOLELY IN EUROS. BASED ON WORK TO DATE, THE

CONVERSION TO THE EURO IS NOT EXPECTED TO HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE

CORPORATION'S OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL CONDITION OR LIQUIDITY.

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

STATEMENTS IN THIS DISCUSSION REGARDING EXPECTATIONS, PLANS AND FUTURE EVENTS OR

CONDITIONS ARE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS. ACTUAL FUTURE RESULTS, INCLUDING

MERGER RELATED EXPENSES; SYNERGY BENEFITS FROM THE MERGER (INCLUDING COST

SAVINGS, EFFICIENCY GAINS AND REVENUE ENHANCEMENTS); FINANCING SOURCES; THE

RESOLUTION OF CONTINGENCIES; THE EFFECT OF CHANGES IN PRICES, INTEREST RATES AND

OTHER MARKET CONDITIONS; AND ENVIRONMENTAL AND CAPITAL EXPENDITURES COULD DIFFER

MATERIALLY DEPENDING ON A NUMBER OF FACTORS. THESE FACTORS INCLUDE MANAGEMENT'S

ABILITY TO IMPLEMENT MERGER PLANS SUCCESSFULLY AND ON SCHEDULE; THE OUTCOME OF

COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS; CHANGES IN THE SUPPLY OF AND DEMAND FOR CRUDE OIL,

NATURAL GAS, AND PETROLEUM AND PETRO-CHEMICAL PRODUCTS; AND OTHER FACTORS

DISCUSSED ABOVE AND UNDER THE CAPTION "FACTORS AFFECTING FUTURE RESULTS" IN

ITEM 1 OF EXXONMOBIL'S 2000 FORM 10-K.

PRODUCTION AND NET WORKING INTEREST VOLUMES ARE NOT SIGNIFICANT.

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS. AS DISCUSSED IN FOOTNOTE 14, THE CORPORATION MAKES

LIMITED USE OF DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS TO HEDGE ITS EXPOSURES ASSOCIATED WITH

INTEREST RATES, FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES AND HYDROCARBON PRICES. GAINS

AND LOSSES ON HEDGING CONTRACTS ARE RECOGNIZED CONCURRENT WITH THE RECOGNITION

OF THE ECONOMIC IMPACT OF THE UNDERLYING EXPOSURES USING EITHER THE ACCRUAL OR

DEFERRAL METHOD OF ACCOUNTING. IN ORDER TO QUALIFY FOR HEDGE ACCOUNTING, THE

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENT MUST BE DESIGNATED AND EFFECTIVE AS A HEDGE.

THE ACCRUAL METHOD IS USED FOR INTEREST RATE SWAPS, CROSS-CURRENCY INTEREST

RATE SWAPS AND COMMODITY SWAPS. UNDER THE ACCRUAL METHOD, DIFFERENTIALS IN THE

SWAPPED AMOUNTS ARE RECORDED AS ADJUSTMENTS OF THE UNDERLYING PERIODIC CASH

FLOWS THAT ARE BEING HEDGED. IF THESE SWAPS ARE TERMINATED, THE GAINS AND

LOSSES ARE AMORTIZED OVER THE ORIGINAL LIVES OF SUCH CONTRACTS. THE DEFERRAL

METHOD IS USED FOR FUTURES EXCHANGE CONTRACTS, FORWARD CONTRACTS AND COMMODITY

SWAPS. GAINS AND LOSSES RESULTING FROM CHANGES IN VALUE OF DERIVATIVE

INSTRUMENTS ARE DEFERRED AND RECOGNIZED IN THE SAME PERIOD AS THE GAINS AND

LOSSES OF THE ITEMS BEING HEDGED.

CASH FLOW FROM DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS THAT QUALIFY FOR HEDGE ACCOUNTING IS

INCLUDED IN THE SAME CATEGORY FOR CASH FLOW PURPOSES AS THE ITEM BEING HEDGED.

INVENTORIES. CRUDE OIL, PRODUCTS AND MERCHANDISE INVENTORIES ARE CARRIED AT THE

LOWER OF CURRENT MARKET VALUE OR COST (GENERALLY DETERMINED UNDER THE LAST-IN,

FIRST-OUT METHOD - LIFO). COSTS INCLUDE APPLICABLE PURCHASE COSTS AND OPERATING

EXPENSES BUT NOT GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES OR RESEARCH AND

DEVELOPMENT COSTS. INVENTORIES OF MATERIALS AND SUPPLIES ARE VALUED AT COST OR

LESS.

PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT. DEPRECIATION, DEPLETION AND AMORTIZATION, BASED

ON COST LESS ESTIMATED SALVAGE VALUE OF THE ASSET, ARE PRIMARILY DETERMINED

UNDER EITHER THE UNIT-OF-PRODUCTION METHOD OR THE STRAIGHT-LINE METHOD. UNIT-

OF-PRODUCTION RATES ARE BASED ON OIL, GAS AND OTHER MINERAL RESERVES ESTIMATED

TO BE RECOVERABLE FROM EXISTING FACILITIES. THE STRAIGHT-LINE METHOD OF

DEPRECIATION IS BASED ON ESTIMATED ASSET SERVICE LIFE TAKING OBSOLESCENCE INTO

CONSIDERATION.

MAINTENANCE AND REPAIRS ARE EXPENSED AS INCURRED. MAJOR RENEWALS AND

IMPROVEMENTS ARE CAPITALIZED AND THE ASSETS REPLACED ARE RETIRED.

THE CORPORATION'S UPSTREAM ACTIVITIES ARE ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER THE "SUCCESSFUL

EFFORTS" METHOD. UNDER THIS METHOD, COSTS OF PRODUCTIVE WELLS AND DEVELOPMENT

DRY HOLES, BOTH TANGIBLE AND INTANGIBLE, AS WELL AS PRODUCTIVE ACREAGE ARE

CAPITALIZED AND AMORTIZED ON THE UNIT-OF-PRODUCTION METHOD. COSTS OF THAT

PORTION OF UNDEVELOPED ACREAGE LIKELY TO BE UNPRODUCTIVE, BASED LARGELY ON

HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE, ARE AMORTIZED OVER THE PERIOD OF EXPLORATION. OTHER

EXPLORATORY EXPENDITURES, INCLUDING GEOPHYSICAL COSTS, OTHER DRY HOLE COSTS AND

ANNUAL LEASE RENTALS, ARE EXPENSED AS INCURRED. EXPLORATORY WELLS THAT FIND OIL

AND GAS IN AN AREA REQUIRING A MAJOR CAPITAL EXPENDITURE BEFORE PRODUCTION

COULD BEGIN ARE EVALUATED ANNUALLY TO ASSURE THAT COMMERCIAL QUANTITIES OF

RESERVES HAVE BEEN FOUND OR THAT ADDITIONAL EXPLORATION WORK IS UNDERWAY OR

PLANNED. EXPLORATORY WELL COSTS NOT MEETING EITHER OF THESE TESTS ARE CHARGED

TO EXPENSE.

OIL, GAS AND OTHER PROPERTIES HELD AND USED BY THE CORPORATION ARE REVIEWED

FOR IMPAIRMENT WHENEVER EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THAT THE

CARRYING AMOUNTS MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE. THE CORPORATION ESTIMATES THE FUTURE

UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS OF THE AFFECTED PROPERTIES TO JUDGE THE RECOVERABILITY

OF CARRYING AMOUNTS. IN GENERAL, ANALYSES ARE BASED ON PROVED RESERVES, EXCEPT

IN CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE IT IS PROBABLE THAT ADDITIONAL RESOURCES WILL BE

DEVELOPED AND CONTRIBUTE TO CASH FLOWS IN THE FUTURE.

ENVIRONMENTAL CONSERVATION AND SITE RESTORATION COSTS. LIABILITIES FOR

ENVIRONMENTAL CONSERVATION ARE RECORDED WHEN IT IS PROBABLE THAT OBLIGATIONS

HAVE BEEN INCURRED AND THE AMOUNTS CAN BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED. THESE

LIABILITIES ARE NOT REDUCED BY POSSIBLE RECOVERIES FROM THIRD PARTIES, AND

PROJECTED CASH EXPENDITURES ARE NOT DISCOUNTED.

SITE RESTORATION COSTS THAT MAY BE INCURRED BY THE CORPORATION AT THE END OF

THE OPERATING LIFE OF CERTAIN OF ITS FACILITIES AND PROPERTIES ARE RESERVED

RATABLY OVER THE ASSET'S PRODUCTIVE LIFE.

32

FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION. THE "FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY" FOR TRANSLATING THE

ACCOUNTS OF THE MAJORITY OF DOWNSTREAM AND CHEMICAL OPERATIONS OUTSIDE THE U.S.

IS THE LOCAL CURRENCY. LOCAL CURRENCY IS ALSO USED FOR UPSTREAM OPERATIONS THAT

ARE RELATIVELY SELF-CONTAINED AND INTEGRATED WITHIN A PARTICULAR COUNTRY, SUCH

AS IN CANADA, THE UNITED KINGDOM, NORWAY AND CONTINENTAL EUROPE. THE U.S.

DOLLAR IS USED FOR OPERATIONS IN HIGHLY INFLATIONARY ECONOMIES, IN SINGAPORE

WHICH IS PREDOMINANTLY EXPORT ORIENTED AND FOR SOME UPSTREAM OPERATIONS,

PRIMARILY IN MALAYSIA, INDONESIA, NIGERIA, EQUATORIAL GUINEA AND THE MIDDLE

EAST. FOR ALL OPERATIONS, GAINS OR LOSSES ON REMEASURING FOREIGN CURRENCY

TRANSACTIONS INTO FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY ARE INCLUDED IN INCOME.

2. EXTRAORDINARY ITEM AND ACCOUNTING CHANGE

NET INCOME FOR 2000 INCLUDED A NET AFTER-TAX GAIN OF $1,730 MILLION (NET OF $308

MILLION OF INCOME TAXES), OR $0.49 PER COMMON SHARE -- ASSUMING DILUTION, FROM

ASSET DIVESTMENTS THAT WERE REQUIRED AS A CONDITION OF THE REGULATORY APPROVAL

OF THE MERGER. THE NET AFTER-TAX GAIN ON REQUIRED DIVESTMENTS WAS REPORTED AS AN

EXTRAORDINARY ITEM ACCORDING TO ACCOUNTING REQUIREMENTS FOR BUSINESS

COMBINATIONS ACCOUNTED FOR AS A POOLING OF INTERESTS.

EFFECTIVE AS OF JANUARY 1, 1998, THE CORPORATION ADOPTED THE AMERICAN

INSTITUTE OF CERTIFIED PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS' STATEMENT OF POSITION 98-5,

"REPORTING ON THE COSTS OF START-UP ACTIVITIES." THIS STATEMENT REQUIRES THAT

COSTS OF START-UP ACTIVITIES AND ORGANIZATIONAL COSTS BE EXPENSED AS INCURRED.

THE CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF THIS ACCOUNTING CHANGE ON YEARS PRIOR TO 1998 WAS A

CHARGE OF $70 MILLION (NET OF $70 MILLION INCOME TAX EFFECT), OR $0.02 PER

COMMON SHARE.

3. MERGER OF EXXON CORPORATION AND MOBIL CORPORATION

ON NOVEMBER 30, 1999, A WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARY OF EXXON CORPORATION (EXXON)

MERGED WITH MOBIL CORPORATION (MOBIL) SO THAT MOBIL BECAME A WHOLLY-OWNED

SUBSIDIARY OF EXXON (THE "MERGER"). AT THE SAME TIME, EXXON CHANGED ITS NAME TO

EXXON MOBIL CORPORATION (EXXONMOBIL). UNDER THE TERMS OF THE AGREEMENT,

APPROXIMATELY 1.0 BILLION SHARES OF EXXONMOBIL COMMON STOCK WERE ISSUED IN

EXCHANGE FOR ALL THE OUTSTANDING SHARES OF MOBIL COMMON STOCK BASED UPON AN

EXCHANGE RATIO OF 1.32015. FOLLOWING THE EXCHANGE, FORMER SHAREHOLDERS OF EXXON

OWNED APPROXIMATELY 70 PERCENT OF THE CORPORATION, WHILE FORMER MOBIL

SHAREHOLDERS OWNED APPROXIMATELY 30 PERCENT OF THE CORPORATION. EACH OUTSTANDING

SHARE OF MOBIL PREFERRED STOCK WAS CONVERTED INTO ONE SHARE OF A NEW CLASS OF

EXXONMOBIL PREFERRED STOCK.

AS A RESULT OF THE MERGER, THE ACCOUNTS OF CERTAIN DOWNSTREAM AND CHEMICALS

OPERATIONS JOINTLY CONTROLLED BY THE COMBINING COMPANIES HAVE BEEN INCLUDED IN

THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. THESE OPERATIONS WERE PREVIOUSLY

ACCOUNTED FOR BY EXXON AND MOBIL AS SEPARATE COMPANIES USING THE EQUITY METHOD

OF ACCOUNTING.

THE MERGER WAS ACCOUNTED FOR AS A POOLING OF INTERESTS. ACCORDINGLY, THE

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GIVE RETROACTIVE EFFECT TO THE MERGER, WITH

ALL PERIODS PRESENTED AS IF EXXON AND MOBIL HAD ALWAYS BEEN COMBINED. CERTAIN

RECLASSIFICATIONS HAVE BEEN MADE TO CONFORM THE PRESENTATION OF EXXON AND

MOBIL.

(1) CONSOLIDATION OF ACTIVITIES PREVIOUSLY ACCOUNTED FOR USING THE EQUITY

METHOD OF ACCOUNTING.

AS A CONDITION OF THE APPROVAL OF THE MERGER, THE U.S. FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION

AND THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION REQUIRED THAT CERTAIN PROPERTY -- PRIMARILY

DOWNSTREAM, PIPELINE AND NATURAL GAS DISTRIBUTION ASSETS -- BE DIVESTED. THESE

ASSETS, WITH A CARRYING VALUE OF APPROXIMATELY $3 BILLION, WERE SOLD IN THE YEAR

2000. THE NET AFTER-TAX GAIN OF $1,730 MILLION WAS REPORTED AS AN EXTRAORDINARY

ITEM. THE PROPERTIES HAVE HISTORICALLY EARNED APPROXIMATELY $200 MILLION PER

YEAR.

4. REORGANIZATION COSTS

IN ASSOCIATION WITH THE MERGER, $1,406 MILLION PRE-TAX ($920 MILLION AFTER-TAX)

AND $625 MILLION PRE-TAX ($469 MILLION AFTER-TAX) OF COSTS WERE RECORDED AS

MERGER RELATED EXPENSES IN 2000 AND 1999, RESPECTIVELY. CUMULATIVE CHARGES

INCLUDED SEPARATION EXPENSES OF APPROXIMATELY $1,125 MILLION RELATED TO

WORKFORCE REDUCTIONS (APPROXIMATELY 6,000 EMPLOYEES AT YEAR-END 2000), PLUS

IMPLEMENTATION AND MERGER CLOSING COSTS. THE SEPARATION RESERVE BALANCE AT YEAR

END 2000 OF APPROXIMATELY $320 MILLION, IS EXPECTED TO BE EXPENDED IN 2001.

IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 1999, THE CORPORATION RECORDED A $120 MILLION AFTER-

TAX CHARGE FOR THE NON-MERGER RELATED REORGANIZATION OF JAPANESE DOWNSTREAM

OPERATIONS IN ITS WHOLLY-OWNED ESSO SEKIYU K.K. AND 50.1 PERCENT OWNED GENERAL

SEKIYU K.K. AFFILIATES. THE REORGANIZATION RESULTED IN THE REDUCTION OF

APPROXIMATELY 700 ADMINISTRATIVE, FINANCIAL, LOGISTICS AND MARKETING SERVICE

EMPLOYEE POSITIONS. THE JAPANESE AFFILIATES RECORDED A COMBINED CHARGE OF $216

MILLION (BEFORE-TAX) TO SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES FOR THE

EMPLOYEE RELATED COSTS. SUBSTANCIALLY ALL CASH EXPENDITURES ANTICIPATED IN THE

RESTRUCTURING PROVISION HAVE BEEN PAID AS OF THE END OF 1999. GENERAL SEKIYU

ALSO RECORDED A $211 MILLION (BEFORE-TAX) CHARGE TO

DEPRECIATION AND DEPLETION FOR THE WRITE-OFF OF COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE

CANCELLATION OF A POWER PLANT PROJECT AT THE KAWASAKI TERMINAL.

IN 1998, MOBIL IMPLEMENTED NEW REORGANIZATION PROGRAMS IN AUSTRALIA AND NEW

ZEALAND AND IN LATIN AMERICA TO INTEGRATE REGIONAL FUELS AND LUBES OPERATIONS.

THESE PROGRAMS RESULTED IN THE ELIMINATION OF APPROXIMATELY 500 POSITIONS AS

WELL AS ASSET WRITE-DOWNS IN AUSTRALIA AND NEW ZEALAND. A PROVISION OF $50

MILLION ($41 MILLION AFTER-TAX) WAS RECORDED IN SELLING, GENERAL AND

ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES AND DEPRECIATION AND DEPLETION FOR THESE PROGRAMS. IN

1998 AND 1999, A COMBINATION OF CASH FOR EMPLOYEE SEPARATION BENEFITS AND EXIT

COSTS AND NONCASH COSTS FOR THE CLOSURE OF FACILITIES ESSENTIALLY DEPLETED THE

RESERVE.

IN 1997, MOBIL AND BP ANNOUNCED THAT THEIR ALLIANCE WOULD IMPLEMENT A MAJOR

RESTRUCTURING OF ITS LUBRICANT BASE OIL REFINING BUSINESS. THIS PROGRAM

RESULTED IN THE ELIMINATION OF APPROXIMATELY 460 POSITIONS AND IN WRITE-DOWNS

AND CLOSURE OF CERTAIN FACILITIES AND WAS COMPLETED BY THE END OF 1999.

RESERVES WERE RECORDED IN 1997 OF ABOUT $86 MILLION ($82 MILLION AFTER-TAX)

MAINLY FOR EMPLOYEE SEVERANCE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH WORKFORCE REDUCTIONS AND

FOR WRITE-DOWNS AND CLOSURE OF CERTAIN FACILITIES. THESE COSTS WERE RECORDED IN

EARNINGS FROM EQUITY INTERESTS AND SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE

EXPENSES. CASH OUTLAYS HAVE BEEN APPROXIMATELY $70 MILLION AND NON-CASH COSTS

ABOUT $20 MILLION. THERE WAS NO AMOUNT REMAINING IN THIS RESERVE AT DECEMBER

31, 2000, FOR THIS PROGRAM.

ALSO IN 1997, MOBIL COMMENCED TWO MAJOR COST SAVINGS INITIATIVES IN ASIA-

PACIFIC -- ONE IN JAPAN IN RESPONSE TO THE DEREGULATED BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT AND

THE OTHER IN AUSTRALIA. THESE PROGRAMS RESULTED IN THE ELIMINATION OF

APPROXIMATELY 400 POSITIONS AND THE IMPAIRMENT OF CERTAIN ASSETS. IN 1997,

RESERVES WERE RECORDED IN THE AMOUNT OF $172 MILLION ($107 MILLION AFTER-TAX)

PRIMARILY FOR SEPARATION COSTS RELATED TO WORKFORCE REDUCTIONS AND FOR CLOSURE

OF CERTAIN FACILITIES. THE PROVISIONS WERE RECORDED IN SELLING, GENERAL AND

ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES; OPERATING EXPENSES; EARNINGS FROM EQUITY INTERESTS AND

OTHER REVENUE AND DEPRECIATION AND DEPLETION. AT THE END OF 2000 THE RESERVE

WAS ESSENTIALLY DEPLETED.

12. CAPITAL

AT THE EFFECTIVE TIME OF THE MERGER OF EXXON AND MOBIL, THE AUTHORIZED COMMON

STOCK OF EXXONMOBIL WAS INCREASED FROM THREE BILLION SHARES TO 4.5 BILLION

SHARES. UNDER THE TERMS OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT, APPROXIMATELY 1.0 BILLION

SHARES OF EXXONMOBIL COMMON STOCK WERE ISSUED IN EXCHANGE FOR ALL OF THE

OUTSTANDING SHARES OF MOBIL'S COMMON STOCK BASED UPON AN EXCHANGE RATIO OF

1.32015 EXXONMOBIL SHARES FOR EACH MOBIL SHARE. MOBIL'S COMMON STOCK ACCOUNTED

FOR AS TREASURY STOCK WAS CANCELLED AT THE EFFECTIVE TIME OF THE MERGER.

IN 1989, MOBIL SOLD 206 THOUSAND SHARES OF A NEW ISSUE OF SERIES B

CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK TO ITS EMPLOYEE STOCK OWNERSHIP PLAN (MOBIL ESOP)

TRUST FOR $3,887.50 PER SHARE. EACH PREFERRED SHARE WAS CONVERTIBLE INTO 100

SHARES OF MOBIL COMMON STOCK. THE PROCEEDS OF THE ISSUANCE WERE USED BY MOBIL

FOR GENERAL CORPORATE PURPOSES. DIVIDENDS WERE CUMULATIVE AND PAYABLE IN AN

AMOUNT PER SHARE EQUAL TO $300 PER ANNUM. IN CONNECTION WITH THE MERGER, EACH

OUTSTANDING SHARE OF MOBIL'S SERIES B CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK WAS CONVERTED

INTO ONE SHARE OF EXXONMOBIL CLASS B PREFERRED STOCK WITH SIMILAR TERMS. EACH

SHARE OF EXXONMOBIL CLASS B PREFERRED STOCK WAS CONVERTIBLE INTO 132.015 SHARES

OF EXXONMOBIL COMMON STOCK. IN 1999 AND 1998, MOBIL SERIES B CONVERTIBLE

PREFERRED STOCK TOTALING 6 THOUSAND SHARES IN EACH YEAR WERE REDEEMED. IN 1999,

AFTER THE MERGER, 159 THOUSAND SHARES OF EXXONMOBIL CLASS B PREFERRED STOCK

TOTALING $618 MILLION WERE CONVERTED TO EXXONMOBIL COMMON STOCK. NO SHARES OF

CLASS B PREFERRED STOCK REMAIN OUTSTANDING.

IN 1989, EXXON SOLD 16.3 MILLION SHARES OF A NEW ISSUE OF CONVERTIBLE CLASS A

PREFERRED STOCK TO ITS LEVERAGED EMPLOYEE STOCK OWNERSHIP PLAN (EXXON LESOP)

TRUST FOR $61.50 PER SHARE. THE PROCEEDS OF THE ISSUANCE WERE USED BY EXXON FOR

GENERAL CORPORATE PURPOSES. IF THE COMMON SHARE PRICE EXCEEDED $30.75, ONE

SHARE OF EXXON CLASS A PREFERRED STOCK WAS CONVERTIBLE INTO TWO SHARES OF

COMMON STOCK. IF THE PRICE WAS $30.75 OR LESS, ONE SHARE OF PREFERRED STOCK WAS

CONVERTIBLE INTO COMMON SHARES HAVING A VALUE OF $61.50. DIVIDENDS WERE

CUMULATIVE AND PAYABLE IN AN AMOUNT PER SHARE EQUAL TO $4.680 PER ANNUM. IN

1999 AND 1998, 1.7 MILLION AND 1.4 MILLION SHARES OF EXXON CLASS A PREFERRED

STOCK TOTALING $105 MILLION AND $85 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, WERE CONVERTED TO

COMMON STOCK. AT YEAR-END 1999, NO SHARES OF CLASS A PREFERRED STOCK REMAINED

OUTSTANDING.

IN 1989, $1,800 MILLION OF BENEFIT PLAN RELATED BALANCES WERE RECORDED AS DEBT

AND AS A REDUCTION TO SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY, REPRESENTING EXXON AND MOBIL

GUARANTEED BORROWINGS BY THE MOBIL ESOP AND EXXON LESOP TRUSTS TO PURCHASE

PREFERRED STOCK. AS THE DEBT IS REPAID AND COMMON SHARES ARE EARNED BY

EMPLOYEES, THE BENEFIT PLAN RELATED BALANCES ARE BEING EXTINGUISHED. PREFERRED

DIVIDENDS OF $36 MILLION AND $60 MILLION WERE PAID DURING 1999 AND 1998,

RESPECTIVELY.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

13. EMPLOYEE STOCK OWNERSHIP PLANS

IN 1989, THE EXXON LEVERAGED EMPLOYEE STOCK OWNERSHIP PLAN (EXXON LESOP) TRUST

BORROWED $1,000 MILLION UNDER THE TERMS OF NOTES GUARANTEED BY EXXON MATURING

BETWEEN 1990 AND 1999. AS FURTHER DESCRIBED IN NOTE 12, THE EXXON LESOP TRUST

USED THE PROCEEDS OF THE BORROWING TO PURCHASE SHARES OF EXXON'S CONVERTIBLE

CLASS A PREFERRED STOCK. THE FINAL EXXON LESOP NOTE MATURED IN 1999 WITH THE

FINAL PRINCIPAL PAYMENT OF THE OUTSTANDING DEBT. ALL REMAINING SHARES OF EXXON

CLASS A PREFERRED STOCK WERE CONVERTED TO EXXONMOBIL COMMON SHARES.

IN 1989, THE MOBIL OIL CORPORATION EMPLOYEE STOCK OWNERSHIP PLAN (MOBIL ESOP)

TRUST BORROWED $800 MILLION UNDER THE TERMS OF NOTES AND DEBENTURES GUARANTEED

BY MOBIL. AS FURTHER DESCRIBED IN NOTE 12, THE TRUST USED THE PROCEEDS OF THE

BORROWING TO PURCHASE SHARES OF MOBIL'S SERIES B CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK

WHICH UPON THE MERGER WERE CONVERTED INTO SHARES OF EXXONMOBIL CLASS B

PREFERRED STOCK WITH SIMILAR TERMS. BY YEAR-END 1999, ALL OUTSTANDING SHARES OF

CLASS B PREFERRED STOCK WERE CONVERTED TO EXXONMOBIL COMMON SHARES.

THE EXXON LESOP AND MOBIL ESOP WERE MERGED IN LATE 1999 TO CREATE THE

EXXONMOBIL ESOP. EMPLOYEES ELIGIBLE TO PARTICIPATE IN EXXONMOBIL'S SAVINGS PLAN

MAY ELECT TO PARTICIPATE IN THE EXXONMOBIL ESOP. CORPORATE CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE

PLAN AND DIVIDENDS ARE USED TO MAKE PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST PAYMENTS ON THE

NOTES AND DEBENTURES. AS CONTRIBUTIONS AND DIVIDENDS ARE CREDITED, COMMON

SHARES ARE ALLOCATED TO PARTICIPANTS' ACCOUNTS. WHEN DEBT SERVICE EXCEEDED

DIVIDENDS, EXXONMOBIL FUNDED THE EXCESS. THE EXCESS FOR THE EXXONMOBIL ESOP WAS

$15 MILLION, $19 MILLION, AND $15 MILLION IN 2000, 1999, AND 1998,

RESPECTIVELY.

ACCOUNTING FOR THE PLANS HAS FOLLOWED THE PRINCIPLES WHICH WERE IN EFFECT FOR

THE RESPECTIVE PLANS WHEN THEY WERE ESTABLISHED. THE AMOUNT OF COMPENSATION

EXPENSE RELATED TO THE PLANS AND RECORDED BY THE CORPORATION DURING THE PERIODS

WAS NOT SIGNIFICANT. THE EXXONMOBIL ESOP TRUST HELD 59.9 MILLION SHARES OF

EXXONMOBIL COMMON STOCK AT THE END OF 1999 AND 54.6 MILLION SHARES AT THE END

OF 2000.

14. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

THE FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS IS DETERMINED BY REFERENCE TO VARIOUS

MARKET DATA AND OTHER VALUATION TECHNIQUES AS APPROPRIATE. LONG-TERM DEBT IS

THE ONLY CATEGORY OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WHOSE FAIR VALUE DIFFERS MATERIALLY

FROM THE RECORDED BOOK VALUE. THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF TOTAL LONG-TERM DEBT,

INCLUDING CAPITALIZED LEASE OBLIGATIONS, AT DECEMBER 31, 2000 AND 1999, WAS

$8.0 BILLION AND $8.9 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY, AS COMPARED TO RECORDED BOOK

VALUES OF $7.3 BILLION AND $8.4 BILLION.

THE CORPORATION'S SIZE, GEOGRAPHIC DIVERSITY AND THE COMPLEMENTARY NATURE OF

THE UPSTREAM, DOWNSTREAM AND CHEMICALS BUSINESSES MITIGATE THE CORPORATION'S

RISK FROM CHANGES IN INTEREST RATE, FOREIGN CURRENCY RATE AND COMMODITY PRICES.

AS A RESULT, THE CORPORATION MAKES LIMITED USE OF DERIVATIVES TO OFFSET

EXPOSURES ARISING FROM EXISTING TRANSACTIONS. DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS ARE NOT

HELD FOR TRADING PURPOSES NOR DO THEY HAVE LEVERAGED FEATURES. IN ADDITION,

THEY ARE EITHER PURCHASED OR SOLD OVER AUTHORIZED EXCHANGES OR WITH

COUNTERPARTIES OF HIGH CREDIT STANDING. AS A RESULT OF THE ABOVE FACTORS, THE

CORPORATION'S EXPOSURE TO CREDIT RISKS AND MARKET RISKS FROM DERIVATIVE

ACTIVITIES IS NEGLIGIBLE.

THE NOTIONAL PRINCIPAL AMOUNTS OF DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AT DECEMBER

31, ARE AS FOLLOWS.

15. LONG-TERM DEBT

AT DECEMBER 31, 2000, LONG-TERM DEBT CONSISTED OF $6,630 MILLION DUE IN U.S.

DOLLARS AND $650 MILLION REPRESENTING THE U.S. DOLLAR EQUIVALENT AT YEAR-END

EXCHANGE RATES OF AMOUNTS PAYABLE IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES. THESE AMOUNTS EXCLUDE

THAT PORTION OF LONG-TERM DEBT, TOTALING $650 MILLION, WHICH MATURES WITHIN ONE

YEAR AND IS INCLUDED IN CURRENT LIABILITIES. THE AMOUNTS OF LONG-TERM DEBT

MATURING, TOGETHER WITH SINKING FUND PAYMENTS REQUIRED, IN EACH OF THE FOUR

YEARS AFTER DECEMBER 31, 2001, IN MILLIONS OF DOLLARS, ARE: 2002 -- $368, 2003

-- $832, 2004 -- $2,245 AND 2005 -- $359. CERTAIN OF THE BORROWINGS DESCRIBED

MAY FROM TIME TO TIME BE ASSIGNED TO OTHER EXXONMOBIL AFFILIATES. AT

DECEMBER 31, 2000, THE CORPORATION'S UNUSED LONG-TERM CREDIT LINES WERE NOT

MATERIAL.

THE TOTAL OUTSTANDING BALANCE OF DEFEASED DEBT AT YEAR-END 2000 WAS $480

MILLION. SUMMARIZED LONG-TERM BORROWINGS AT YEAR-END 2000 AND 1999 WERE AS

16. INCENTIVE PROGRAM

THE 1993 INCENTIVE PROGRAM PROVIDES FOR GRANTS OF STOCK OPTIONS, STOCK

APPRECIATION RIGHTS (SARS), RESTRICTED STOCK AND OTHER FORMS OF AWARD. AWARDS

MAY BE GRANTED OVER A 10-YEAR PERIOD TO ELIGIBLE EMPLOYEES OF THE CORPORATION

AND THOSE AFFILIATES AT LEAST 50 PERCENT OWNED. THE NUMBER OF SHARES OF STOCK

WHICH MAY BE AWARDED EACH YEAR UNDER THE 1993 INCENTIVE PROGRAM MAY NOT EXCEED

SEVEN TENTHS OF ONE PERCENT (0.7%), OF THE TOTAL NUMBER OF SHARES OF COMMON

STOCK OF THE CORPORATION OUTSTANDING (EXCLUDING SHARES HELD BY THE CORPORATION)

ON DECEMBER 31 OF THE PRECEDING YEAR. IF THE TOTAL NUMBER OF SHARES EFFECTIVELY

GRANTED IN ANY YEAR IS LESS THAN THE MAXIMUM NUMBER OF SHARES ALLOWABLE, THE

BALANCE MAY BE CARRIED OVER THEREAFTER. OUTSTANDING AWARDS ARE SUBJECT TO

CERTAIN FORFEITURE PROVISIONS CONTAINED IN THE PROGRAM OR AWARD INSTRUMENT.

OPTIONS AND SARS MAY BE GRANTED AT PRICES NOT LESS THAN 100 PERCENT OF

MARKET VALUE ON THE DATE OF GRANT AND HAVE A MAXIMUM LIFE OF 10 YEARS. MOST OF

THE OPTIONS AND SARS NORMALLY FIRST BECOME EXERCISABLE ONE YEAR FOLLOWING THE

DATE OF GRANT.

ON THE CLOSING OF THE MERGER ON NOVEMBER 30, 1999, OUTSTANDING OPTIONS AND

SARS GRANTED BY MOBIL UNDER ITS 1995 INCENTIVE COMPENSATION AND STOCK

OWNERSHIP PLAN AND PRIOR PLANS WERE ASSUMED BY EXXONMOBIL AND CONVERTED INTO

RIGHTS TO ACQUIRE EXXONMOBIL COMMON STOCK WITH ADJUSTMENTS TO REFLECT THE

EXCHANGE RATIO. NO FURTHER AWARDS MAY BE GRANTED UNDER THE FORMER MOBIL PLANS.

SHARES AVAILABLE FOR GRANTING UNDER THE 1993 INCENTIVE PROGRAM WERE 59,536

THOUSAND AT THE BEGINNING OF 2000 AND 42,303 THOUSAND AT THE END OF 2000. AT

DECEMBER 31, 1999 AND 2000, RESPECTIVELY, 1,077 THOUSAND AND 1,219 THOUSAND

SHARES OF RESTRICTED COMMON STOCK WERE OUTSTANDING.

STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS NO. 123, "ACCOUNTING FOR STOCK-

BASED COMPENSATION," WAS IMPLEMENTED IN JANUARY 1996. AS PERMITTED BY THE

STANDARD, EXXONMOBIL RETAINED ITS PRIOR METHOD OF ACCOUNTING FOR STOCK

COMPENSATION. IF THE PROVISIONS OF STATEMENT NO. 123 HAD BEEN ADOPTED, NET

INCOME AND EARNINGS PER SHARE (ON BOTH A BASIC AND DILUTED BASIS) WOULD HAVE

BEEN REDUCED BY $296 MILLION, OR $0.08 PER SHARE IN 2000; $149 MILLION, OR

$0.04 PER SHARE IN 1999 AND $134 MILLION, OR $0.04 PER SHARE IN 1998. FOR THE

EXXONMOBIL PLAN, THE AVERAGE FAIR VALUE OF EACH OPTION GRANTED DURING 2000,

1999, AND 1998 WAS $20.36, $19.70 AND $12.80, RESPECTIVELY. THE FAIR VALUE WAS

ESTIMATED AT THE GRANT DATE USING AN OPTION-PRICING MODEL WITH THE FOLLOWING

WEIGHTED AVERAGE ASSUMPTIONS FOR 2000, 1999 AND 1998, RESPECTIVELY: RISK-FREE

INTEREST RATES OF 5.5 PERCENT, 6.2 PERCENT AND 4.8 PERCENT; EXPECTED LIFE OF 6

YEARS FOR ALL YEARS; VOLATILITY OF 16 PERCENT, 15 PERCENT AND 13 PERCENT AND A

DIVIDEND YIELD OF 2.0 PERCENT, 2.1 PERCENT AND 2.3 PERCENT. FOR THE MOBIL

PLANS, THE AVERAGE FAIR VALUE OF EACH MOBIL OPTION GRANTED DURING 1999 AND

1998 WAS $17.02 AND $13.05, RESPECTIVELY. THE FAIR VALUE WAS ESTIMATED AT THE

GRANT DATE USING AN OPTION-PRICING MODEL WITH THE FOLLOWING WEIGHTED AVERAGE

ASSUMPTIONS FOR 1999 AND 1998, RESPECTIVELY: RISK-FREE INTEREST RATES OF 5.2

PERCENT AND 5.7 PERCENT; EXPECTED LIFE OF 5 YEARS FOR BOTH YEARS; VOLATILITY

OF 20 PERCENT AND 18 PERCENT AND A DIVIDEND YIELD OF 2.7 PERCENT AND 3.2

PERCENT.

(INCLUDING THE FORMER MOBIL PLANS) ARE SUMMARIZED BELOW (SHARES IN THOUSANDS).

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

17. LITIGATION AND OTHER CONTINGENCIES

A NUMBER OF LAWSUITS, INCLUDING CLASS ACTIONS, WERE BROUGHT IN VARIOUS COURTS

AGAINST EXXON MOBIL CORPORATION AND CERTAIN OF ITS SUBSIDIARIES RELATING TO THE

ACCIDENTAL RELEASE OF CRUDE OIL FROM THE TANKER EXXON VALDEZ IN 1989.

ESSENTIALLY ALL OF THESE LAWSUITS HAVE NOW BEEN RESOLVED OR ARE SUBJECT TO

APPEAL.

ON SEPTEMBER 24, 1996, THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF

ALASKA ENTERED A JUDGMENT IN THE AMOUNT OF $5.058 BILLION IN THE EXXON VALDEZ

CIVIL TRIAL THAT BEGAN IN MAY 1994. THE DISTRICT COURT AWARDED APPROXIMATELY

$19.6 MILLION IN COMPENSATORY DAMAGES TO FISHER PLAINTIFFS, $38 MILLION IN

PREJUDGMENT INTEREST ON THE COMPENSATORY DAMAGES AND $5 BILLION IN PUNITIVE

DAMAGES TO A CLASS COMPOSED OF ALL PERSONS AND ENTITIES WHO ASSERTED CLAIMS FOR

PUNITIVE DAMAGES FROM THE CORPORATION AS A RESULT OF THE EXXON VALDEZ

GROUNDING. THE DISTRICT COURT ALSO ORDERED THAT THESE AWARDS SHALL BEAR

INTEREST FROM AND AFTER ENTRY OF THE JUDGMENT. THE DISTRICT COURT STAYED

EXECUTION ON THE JUDGMENT PENDING APPEAL BASED ON A $6.75 BILLION LETTER OF

CREDIT POSTED BY THE CORPORATION. EXXONMOBIL HAS APPEALED THE JUDGMENT. THE

UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT HEARD ORAL ARGUMENTS ON

THE APPEAL ON MAY 3, 1999. THE CORPORATION CONTINUES TO BELIEVE THAT THE

PUNITIVE DAMAGES IN THIS CASE ARE UNWARRANTED AND THAT THE JUDGMENT SHOULD BE

SET ASIDE OR SUBSTANTIALLY REDUCED BY THE APPELLATE COURTS.

ON JANUARY 29, 1997, A SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT WAS CONCLUDED RESOLVING ALL

REMAINING MATTERS BETWEEN THE CORPORATION AND VARIOUS INSURERS ARISING FROM THE

VALDEZ ACCIDENT. UNDER TERMS OF THIS SETTLEMENT, EXXONMOBIL RECEIVED $480

MILLION. FINAL INCOME STATEMENT RECOGNITION OF THIS SETTLEMENT CONTINUES TO BE

DEFERRED IN VIEW OF UNCERTAINTY REGARDING THE ULTIMATE COST TO THE CORPORATION

OF THE VALDEZ ACCIDENT.

THE ULTIMATE COST TO EXXONMOBIL FROM THE LAWSUITS ARISING FROM THE EXXON

VALDEZ GROUNDING IS NOT POSSIBLE TO PREDICT AND MAY NOT BE RESOLVED FOR A

NUMBER OF YEARS.

UNDER THE OCTOBER 8, 1991, CIVIL AGREEMENT AND CONSENT DECREES WITH THE U.S.

AND ALASKA GOVERNMENTS, THE CORPORATION WILL MAKE A FINAL PAYMENT OF $70

MILLION IN 2001. THIS PAYMENT, ALONG WITH PRIOR PAYMENTS WILL BE CHARGED

AGAINST THE PROVISION THAT WAS PREVIOUSLY ESTABLISHED TO COVER THE COSTS OF THE

SETTLEMENT.

GERMAN AND DUTCH AFFILIATED COMPANIES ARE THE CONCESSIONAIRES OF A NATURAL

GAS FIELD SUBJECT TO A TREATY BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENTS OF GERMANY AND THE

NETHERLANDS UNDER WHICH THE GAS RESERVES IN AN UNDEFINED BORDER OR COMMON AREA

ARE TO BE SHARED EQUALLY. ENTITLEMENT TO THE RESERVES IS DETERMINED BY

CALCULATING THE AMOUNT OF GAS WHICH CAN BE RECOVERED FROM THIS AREA. BASED ON

THE FINAL RESERVE DETERMINATION, THE GERMAN AFFILIATE HAS RECEIVED MORE GAS

THAN ITS ENTITLEMENT. ARBITRATION PROCEEDINGS, AS PROVIDED IN THE AGREEMENTS,

WERE CONDUCTED TO RESOLVE ISSUES CONCERNING THE COMPENSATION FOR THE OVERLIFTED

GAS.

BY FINAL AWARD DATED JULY 2, 1999, PRECEDED BY AN INTERIM AWARD IN 1996, AN

ARBITRAL TRIBUNAL ESTABLISHED THE FULL AMOUNT OF THE COMPENSATION FOR THE

EXCESS GAS. THIS AMOUNT HAS NOW BEEN PAID AND A PETITION TO SET THE AWARD ASIDE

HAS NOW BEEN DISMISSED, RENDERING THE AWARD FINAL IN ALL RESPECTS. OTHER

SUBSTANTIVE MATTERS REMAIN OUTSTANDING, INCLUDING RECOVERY OF ROYALTIES PAID ON

SUCH EXCESS GAS AND THE TAXES PAYABLE ON THE FINAL COMPENSATION AMOUNT. THE NET

FINANCIAL IMPACT ON THE CORPORATION IS NOT POSSIBLE TO PREDICT AT THIS TIME.

HOWEVER, THE ULTIMATE OUTCOME IS NOT EXPECTED TO HAVE A MATERIALLY ADVERSE

EFFECT UPON THE CORPORATION'S OPERATIONS OR FINANCIAL CONDITION.

ON DECEMBER 19, 2000, A JURY IN MONTGOMERY COUNTY, ALABAMA, RETURNED A

VERDICT AGAINST THE CORPORATION IN A CONTRACT DISPUTE OVER ROYALTIES IN THE

AMOUNT OF $87.69 MILLION IN COMPENSATORY DAMAGES AND $3.42 BILLION IN PUNITIVE

DAMAGES IN THE CASE OF EXXON CORPORATION V. STATE OF ALABAMA, ET AL. EXXONMOBIL

WILL CHALLENGE THE VERDICT AND BELIEVES THAT THE VERDICT IS UNWARRANTED AND

THAT THE JUDGEMENT SHOULD BE SET ASIDE OR SUBSTANTIALLY REDUCED. THE ULTIMATE

OUTCOME IS NOT EXPECTED TO HAVE A MATERIALLY ADVERSE EFFECT UPON THE

CORPORATION'S OPERATIONS OR FINANCIAL CONDITION.

THE U.S. TAX COURT HAS DECIDED THE ISSUE WITH RESPECT TO THE PRICING OF CRUDE

OIL PURCHASED FROM SAUDI ARABIA FOR THE YEARS 1979-1981 IN FAVOR OF THE

CORPORATION. THIS DECISION IS SUBJECT TO APPEAL. CERTAIN OTHER ISSUES FOR THE

YEARS 1979-1993 REMAIN PENDING BEFORE THE TAX COURT. THE ULTIMATE RESOLUTION OF

THESE ISSUES IS NOT EXPECTED TO HAVE A MATERIALLY ADVERSE EFFECT UPON THE

CORPORATION'S OPERATIONS OR FINANCIAL CONDITION.

CLAIMS FOR SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNTS HAVE BEEN MADE AGAINST EXXONMOBIL AND CERTAIN

OF ITS CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES IN OTHER PENDING LAWSUITS, THE OUTCOME OF

WHICH IS NOT EXPECTED TO HAVE A MATERIALLY ADVERSE EFFECT UPON THE

CORPORATION'S OPERATIONS OR FINANCIAL CONDITION.

THE CORPORATION AND CERTAIN OF ITS CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES WERE

CONTINGENTLY LIABLE AT DECEMBER 31, 2000, FOR $2,184 MILLION, PRIMARILY

RELATING TO GUARANTEES FOR NOTES, LOANS AND PERFORMANCE UNDER CONTRACTS. THIS

INCLUDES $770 MILLION REPRESENTING GUARANTEES OF NON-U.S. EXCISE TAXES AND

CUSTOMS DUTIES OF OTHER COMPANIES, ENTERED INTO AS A NORMAL BUSINESS PRACTICE,

UNDER RECIPROCAL ARRANGEMENTS. NOT INCLUDED IN THIS FIGURE ARE GUARANTEES BY

CONSOLIDATED AFFILIATES OF $1,715 MILLION, REPRESENTING EXXONMOBIL'S SHARE OF

OBLIGATIONS OF CERTAIN EQUITY COMPANIES.

ADDITIONALLY, THE CORPORATION AND ITS AFFILIATES HAVE NUMEROUS LONG-TERM

SALES AND PURCHASE COMMITMENTS IN THEIR VARIOUS BUSINESS ACTIVITIES, ALL OF

WHICH ARE EXPECTED TO BE FULFILLED WITH NO ADVERSE CONSEQUENCES MATERIAL TO THE

CORPORATION'S OPERATIONS OR FINANCIAL CONDITION.

THE OPERATIONS AND EARNINGS OF THE CORPORATION AND ITS AFFILIATES THROUGHOUT

THE WORLD HAVE BEEN, AND MAY IN THE FUTURE BE, AFFECTED FROM TIME TO TIME IN

VARYING DEGREE BY POLITICAL DEVELOPMENTS AND LAWS AND REGULATIONS, SUCH AS

FORCED DIVESTITURE OF ASSETS; RESTRICTIONS ON PRODUCTION, IMPORTS AND EXPORTS;

PRICE CONTROLS; TAX INCREASES AND RETROACTIVE TAX CLAIMS; EXPROPRIATION OF

PROPERTY; CANCELLATION OF CONTRACT RIGHTS AND ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS. BOTH

THE LIKELIHOOD OF SUCH OCCURRENCES AND THEIR OVERALL EFFECT UPON THE

CORPORATION VARY GREATLY FROM COUNTRY TO COUNTRY AND ARE NOT PREDICTABLE.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

THE DATA SHOWN ON THE PREVIOUS PAGE ARE REPORTED AS REQUIRED BY CURRENT

ACCOUNTING STANDARDS WHICH SPECIFY USE OF A DISCOUNT RATE AT WHICH

POSTRETIREMENT LIABILITIES COULD BE EFFECTIVELY SETTLED. THE DISCOUNT RATE

STIPULATED FOR USE IN CALCULATING YEAR-END POSTRETIREMENT LIABILITIES IS BASED

ON THE YEAR-END RATE OF INTEREST ON HIGH QUALITY BONDS. FOR DETERMINING THE

FUNDING REQUIREMENTS OF U.S. ANNUITY PLANS IN ACCORDANCE WITH APPLICABLE

FEDERAL GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS, EXXONMOBIL USES THE EXPECTED LONG-TERM RATE OF

RETURN OF THE ANNUITY FUND'S ACTUAL PORTFOLIO AS THE DISCOUNT RATE. THIS RATE

HAS HISTORICALLY BEEN HIGHER THAN BONDS AS THE MAJORITY OF PENSION ASSETS ARE

INVESTED IN EQUITIES. IN FACT, THE ACTUAL RATE EARNED OVER THE PAST DECADE HAS

BEEN 15 PERCENT. ON THIS BASIS, ALL FUNDED U.S. PLANS MEET THE FULL FUNDING

REQUIREMENTS OF THE DEPARTMENT OF LABOR AND THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE AS

DETAILED IN THE TABLE BELOW. CERTAIN SMALLER U.S. PLANS AND A NUMBER OF NON-

U.S. PLANS ARE NOT FUNDED BECAUSE OF LOCAL TAX CONVENTIONS AND REGULATORY

PRACTICES WHICH DO NOT ENCOURAGE FUNDING OF THESE PLANS. BOOK RESERVES HAVE

BEEN ESTABLISHED FOR THESE PLANS TO PROVIDE FOR FUTURE BENEFIT PAYMENTS.
