BUSINESS.

EXXON MOBIL CORPORATION WAS

INCORPORATED IN THE STATE OF NEW JERSEY IN 1882. DIVISIONS AND AFFILIATED COMPANIES OF EXXONMOBIL OPERATE OR MARKET PRODUCTS IN THE UNITED STATES AND MOST OTHER COUNTRIES OF THE WORLD. THEIR PRINCIPAL BUSINESS IS ENERGY, INVOLVING EXPLORATION FOR,

AND PRODUCTION OF, CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS, MANUFACTURE OF PETROLEUM PRODUCTS AND TRANSPORTATION AND SALE OF CRUDE OIL, NATURAL GAS AND PETROLEUM PRODUCTS. EXXONMOBIL IS A MAJOR MANUFACTURER AND MARKETER OF COMMODITY PETROCHEMICALS, INCLUDING

OLEFINS, AROMATICS, POLYETHYLENE AND POLYPROPYLENE PLASTICS AND A WIDE VARIETY OF SPECIALTY PRODUCTS. EXXONMOBIL ALSO HAS INTERESTS IN ELECTRIC POWER GENERATION FACILITIES. AFFILIATES OF EXXONMOBIL CONDUCT EXTENSIVE RESEARCH PROGRAMS IN SUPPORT OF

THESE BUSINESSES.

EXXON MOBIL CORPORATION HAS SEVERAL DIVISIONS AND HUNDREDS OF AFFILIATES, MANY WITH NAMES THAT INCLUDE

EXXONMOBIL

WE

AND

ITS

, ARE SOMETIMES USED AS ABBREVIATED REFERENCES TO SPECIFIC AFFILIATES OR GROUPS OF AFFILIATES. THE PRECISE MEANING DEPENDS ON THE CONTEXT IN QUESTION.

THROUGHOUT EXXONMOBILS BUSINESSES, NEW AND ONGOING MEASURES ARE TAKEN TO PREVENT AND MINIMIZE THE IMPACT OF OUR OPERATIONS ON AIR, WATER

AND GROUND. THESE INCLUDE A SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT IN REFINING INFRASTRUCTURE AND TECHNOLOGY TO MANUFACTURE CLEAN FUELS AS WELL AS PROJECTS TO MONITOR AND REDUCE NITROGEN OXIDE, SULFUR OXIDE, AND GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS AND EXPENDITURES FOR ASSET

RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS. EXXONMOBILS 2011 WORLDWIDE ENVIRONMENTAL EXPENDITURES FOR ALL SUCH PREVENTATIVE AND REMEDIATION STEPS, INCLUDING EXXONMOBILS SHARE OF EQUITY COMPANY EXPENDITURES, WERE $4.9 BILLION, OF WHICH $3.2 BILLION

WERE INCLUDED IN EXPENSES WITH THE REMAINDER IN CAPITAL EXPENDITURES. THE TOTAL COST FOR SUCH ACTIVITIES IS EXPECTED TO REMAIN IN THIS RANGE IN 2012 AND 2013 (WITH CAPITAL EXPENDITURES APPROXIMATELY 45 PERCENT OF THE TOTAL).

THE ENERGY AND PETROCHEMICAL INDUSTRIES ARE HIGHLY COMPETITIVE. THERE IS COMPETITION WITHIN THE INDUSTRIES AND ALSO WITH OTHER INDUSTRIES IN

SUPPLYING THE ENERGY, FUEL AND CHEMICAL NEEDS OF BOTH INDUSTRIAL AND INDIVIDUAL CONSUMERS. THE CORPORATION COMPETES WITH OTHER FIRMS IN THE SALE OR PURCHASE OF NEEDED GOODS AND SERVICES IN MANY NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL MARKETS AND EMPLOYS ALL

METHODS OF COMPETITION WHICH ARE LAWFUL AND APPROPRIATE FOR SUCH PURPOSES.

OPERATING DATA AND INDUSTRY SEGMENT INFORMATION FOR THE

CORPORATION ARE CONTAINED IN THE FINANCIAL SECTION OF THIS REPORT UNDER THE FOLLOWING: QUARTERLY INFORMATION, NOTE 17: DISCLOSURES ABOUT SEGMENTS AND RELATED INFORMATION AND OPERATING SUMMARY. INFORMATION ON

OIL AND GAS RESERVES IS CONTAINED IN THE OIL AND GAS RESERVES PART OF THE SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION ON OIL AND GAS EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION ACTIVITIES PORTION OF THE FINANCIAL SECTION OF THIS REPORT.

EXXONMOBIL HAS A LONG-STANDING COMMITMENT TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF PROPRIETARY TECHNOLOGY. WE HAVE A WIDE ARRAY OF RESEARCH PROGRAMS DESIGNED TO

MEET THE NEEDS IDENTIFIED IN EACH OF OUR BUSINESS SEGMENTS. INFORMATION ON COMPANY-SPONSORED RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT SPENDING IS CONTAINED IN NOTE 3: MISCELLANEOUS FINANCIAL INFORMATION OF THE FINANCIAL SECTION OF THIS REPORT.

EXXONMOBIL HELD APPROXIMATELY 10 THOUSAND ACTIVE PATENTS WORLDWIDE AT THE END OF 2011. FOR TECHNOLOGY LICENSED TO THIRD PARTIES, REVENUES TOTALED APPROXIMATELY $129 MILLION IN 2011. ALTHOUGH TECHNOLOGY IS AN IMPORTANT CONTRIBUTOR TO THE OVERALL

OPERATIONS AND RESULTS OF OUR COMPANY, THE PROFITABILITY OF EACH BUSINESS SEGMENT IS NOT DEPENDENT ON ANY INDIVIDUAL PATENT, TRADE SECRET, TRADEMARK, LICENSE, FRANCHISE OR CONCESSION.

THE NUMBER OF REGULAR EMPLOYEES WAS 82.1 THOUSAND, 83.6 THOUSAND AND 80.7 THOUSAND AT YEARS ENDED 2011, 2010 AND 2009, RESPECTIVELY. REGULAR

EMPLOYEES ARE DEFINED AS ACTIVE EXECUTIVE, MANAGEMENT, PROFESSIONAL, TECHNICAL AND WAGE EMPLOYEES WHO WORK FULL TIME OR PART TIME FOR THE CORPORATION AND ARE COVERED BY THE CORPORATIONS BENEFIT PLANS AND PROGRAMS. REGULAR EMPLOYEES DO NOT

INCLUDE EMPLOYEES OF THE COMPANY-OPERATED RETAIL SITES (CORS). THE NUMBER OF CORS EMPLOYEES WAS 17.0 THOUSAND, 20.1 THOUSAND AND 22.0 THOUSAND AT YEARS ENDED 2011, 2010 AND 2009, RESPECTIVELY.

INFORMATION CONCERNING THE SOURCE AND AVAILABILITY OF RAW MATERIALS USED IN THE CORPORATIONS BUSINESS, THE EXTENT OF SEASONALITY IN THE

BUSINESS, THE POSSIBILITY OF RENEGOTIATION OF PROFITS OR TERMINATION OF CONTRACTS AT THE ELECTION OF GOVERNMENTS AND RISKS ATTENDANT TO FOREIGN OPERATIONS MAY BE FOUND IN ITEM 1ARISK FACTORS AND ITEM 2PROPERTIES

ITEM 1A.

RISK FACTORS.

EXXONMOBILS FINANCIAL

AND OPERATING RESULTS ARE SUBJECT TO A VARIETY OF RISKS INHERENT IN THE GLOBAL OIL, GAS, AND PETROCHEMICAL BUSINESSES. MANY OF THESE RISK FACTORS ARE NOT WITHIN THE COMPANYS CONTROL AND COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, OUR FINANCIAL AND

OPERATING RESULTS OR OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION. THESE RISK FACTORS INCLUDE.

SUPPLY AND DEMAND

THE OIL, GAS, AND PETROCHEMICAL BUSINESSES ARE FUNDAMENTALLY COMMODITY BUSINESSES. THIS MEANS EXXONMOBILS OPERATIONS AND EARNINGS MAY BE

SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTED BY CHANGES IN OIL, GAS AND PETROCHEMICAL PRICES AND BY CHANGES IN MARGINS ON REFINED PRODUCTS. OIL, GAS, PETROCHEMICAL AND PRODUCT PRICES AND MARGINS IN TURN DEPEND ON LOCAL, REGIONAL AND GLOBAL EVENTS OR CONDITIONS THAT

AFFECT SUPPLY AND DEMAND FOR THE RELEVANT COMMODITY.

ECONOMIC CONDITIONS.

THE DEMAND FOR ENERGY AND PETROCHEMICALS CORRELATES

CLOSELY WITH GENERAL ECONOMIC GROWTH RATES. THE OCCURRENCE OF RECESSIONS OR OTHER PERIODS OF LOW OR NEGATIVE ECONOMIC GROWTH WILL TYPICALLY HAVE A DIRECT ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR RESULTS. OTHER FACTORS THAT AFFECT GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS IN THE

WORLD OR IN A MAJOR REGION, SUCH AS CHANGES IN POPULATION GROWTH RATES, PERIODS OF CIVIL UNREST, GOVERNMENT AUSTERITY PROGRAMS, OR CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE FLUCTUATIONS, CAN ALSO IMPACT THE DEMAND FOR ENERGY AND PETROCHEMICALS. SOVEREIGN DEBT

DOWNGRADES, DEFAULTS, INABILITY TO ACCESS DEBT MARKETS DUE TO CREDIT OR LEGAL CONSTRAINTS, LIQUIDITY CRISES, THE BREAKUP OR RESTRUCTURING OF FISCAL, MONETARY, OR POLITICAL SYSTEMS SUCH AS THE EUROPEAN UNION, AND OTHER EVENTS OR CONDITIONS THAT

IMPAIR THE FUNCTIONING OF FINANCIAL MARKETS AND INSTITUTIONS ALSO POSE RISKS TO EXXONMOBIL, INCLUDING RISKS TO THE SAFETY OF OUR FINANCIAL ASSETS AND TO THE ABILITY OF OUR PARTNERS AND CUSTOMERS TO FULFILL THEIR COMMITMENTS TO EXXONMOBIL.

OTHER DEMAND-RELATED FACTORS.

OTHER FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT THE DEMAND FOR OIL, GAS AND PETROCHEMICALS, AND THEREFORE IMPACT

OUR RESULTS, INCLUDE TECHNOLOGICAL IMPROVEMENTS IN ENERGY EFFICIENCY; SEASONAL WEATHER PATTERNS, WHICH AFFECT THE DEMAND FOR ENERGY ASSOCIATED WITH HEATING AND COOLING; INCREASED COMPETITIVENESS OF ALTERNATIVE ENERGY SOURCES THAT HAVE SO FAR

GENERALLY NOT BEEN COMPETITIVE WITH OIL AND GAS WITHOUT THE BENEFIT OF GOVERNMENT SUBSIDIES OR MANDATES; AND CHANGES IN TECHNOLOGY OR CONSUMER PREFERENCES THAT ALTER FUEL CHOICES, SUCH AS TOWARD ALTERNATIVE FUELED VEHICLES.

OTHER SUPPLY-RELATED FACTORS.

COMMODITY PRICES AND MARGINS ALSO VARY DEPENDING ON A NUMBER OF FACTORS AFFECTING SUPPLY. FOR EXAMPLE,

INCREASED SUPPLY FROM THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW OIL AND GAS SUPPLY SOURCES AND TECHNOLOGIES TO ENHANCE RECOVERY FROM EXISTING SOURCES TEND TO REDUCE COMMODITY PRICES TO THE EXTENT SUCH SUPPLY INCREASES ARE NOT OFFSET BY COMMENSURATE GROWTH IN DEMAND.

SIMILARLY, INCREASES IN INDUSTRY REFINING OR PETROCHEMICAL MANUFACTURING CAPACITY TEND TO REDUCE MARGINS ON THE AFFECTED PRODUCTS. WORLD OIL, GAS, AND PETROCHEMICAL SUPPLY LEVELS CAN ALSO BE AFFECTED BY FACTORS THAT REDUCE AVAILABLE SUPPLIES, SUCH

AS ADHERENCE BY MEMBER COUNTRIES TO OPEC PRODUCTION QUOTAS AND THE OCCURRENCE OF WARS, HOSTILE ACTIONS, NATURAL DISASTERS, DISRUPTIONS IN COMPETITORS OPERATIONS, OR UNEXPECTED UNAVAILABILITY OF DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS THAT MAY DISRUPT SUPPLIES.

TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE CAN ALSO ALTER THE RELATIVE COSTS FOR COMPETITORS TO FIND, PRODUCE, AND REFINE OIL AND GAS AND TO MANUFACTURE PETROCHEMICALS.

OTHER MARKET FACTORS.

EXXONMOBILS BUSINESS RESULTS ARE ALSO EXPOSED TO POTENTIAL NEGATIVE IMPACTS DUE TO CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES, INFLATION, AND OTHER LOCAL OR REGIONAL MARKET CONDITIONS. WE

GENERALLY DO NOT USE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS TO HEDGE MARKET EXPOSURES.

GOVERNMENT AND POLITICAL FACTORS

EXXONMOBILS RESULTS CAN BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY POLITICAL OR REGULATORY DEVELOPMENTS AFFECTING OUR OPERATIONS.

ACCESS LIMITATIONS.

A NUMBER OF COUNTRIES LIMIT ACCESS TO THEIR OIL AND GAS RESOURCES, OR MAY PLACE RESOURCES OFF-LIMITS FROM DEVELOPMENT

ALTOGETHER. RESTRICTIONS ON FOREIGN INVESTMENT IN THE OIL AND GAS SECTOR TEND TO INCREASE IN TIMES OF HIGH COMMODITY PRICES, WHEN NATIONAL GOVERNMENTS MAY HAVE LESS NEED OF OUTSIDE SOURCES OF PRIVATE CAPITAL. MANY COUNTRIES ALSO RESTRICT THE IMPORT

OR EXPORT OF CERTAIN PRODUCTS BASED ON POINT OF ORIGIN.

RESTRICTIONS ON DOING BUSINESS.

AS A U.S. COMPANY, EXXONMOBIL IS

SUBJECT TO LAWS PROHIBITING U.S. COMPANIES FROM DOING BUSINESS IN CERTAIN COUNTRIES, OR RESTRICTING THE KIND OF BUSINESS THAT MAY BE CONDUCTED. SUCH RESTRICTIONS MAY PROVIDE A COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE TO OUR NON-U.S. COMPETITORS UNLESS THEIR OWN HOME

COUNTRIES IMPOSE COMPARABLE RESTRICTIONS.

INDEX TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

LACK OF LEGAL CERTAINTY.

SOME COUNTRIES IN WHICH WE DO BUSINESS LACK WELL-DEVELOPED LEGAL

SYSTEMS, OR HAVE NOT YET ADOPTED CLEAR REGULATORY FRAMEWORKS FOR OIL AND GAS DEVELOPMENT. LACK OF LEGAL CERTAINTY EXPOSES OUR OPERATIONS TO INCREASED RISK OF ADVERSE OR UNPREDICTABLE ACTIONS BY GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS, AND ALSO MAKES IT MORE DIFFICULT

FOR US TO ENFORCE OUR CONTRACTS. IN SOME CASES THESE RISKS CAN BE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AGREEMENTS TO ARBITRATE DISPUTES IN AN INTERNATIONAL FORUM, BUT THE ADEQUACY OF THIS REMEDY MAY STILL DEPEND ON THE LOCAL LEGAL SYSTEM TO ENFORCE AN AWARD.

REGULATORY AND LITIGATION RISKS.

EVEN IN COUNTRIES WITH WELL-DEVELOPED LEGAL SYSTEMS WHERE EXXONMOBIL DOES BUSINESS, WE

REMAIN EXPOSED TO CHANGES IN LAW (INCLUDING CHANGES THAT RESULT FROM INTERNATIONAL TREATIES AND ACCORDS) THAT COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS, SUCH AS.



INCREASES IN TAXES OR GOVERNMENT ROYALTY RATES (INCLUDING RETROACTIVE CLAIMS);



PRICE CONTROLS;



CHANGES IN ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS OR OTHER LAWS THAT INCREASE OUR COST OF COMPLIANCE OR REDUCE OR DELAY AVAILABLE BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES (INCLUDING CHANGES

IN LAWS RELATED TO OFFSHORE DRILLING OPERATIONS, WATER USE, OR HYDRAULIC FRACTURING);



ADOPTION OF REGULATIONS MANDATING THE USE OF ALTERNATIVE FUELS OR UNCOMPETITIVE FUEL COMPONENTS;



ADOPTION OF GOVERNMENT PAYMENT TRANSPARENCY REGULATIONS THAT COULD REQUIRE US TO DISCLOSE COMPETITIVELY SENSITIVE COMMERCIAL INFORMATION, OR THAT COULD CAUSE

US TO VIOLATE THE NON-DISCLOSURE LAWS OF OTHER COUNTRIES; AND



GOVERNMENT ACTIONS TO CANCEL CONTRACTS, RE-DENOMINATE THE OFFICIAL CURRENCY, RENOUNCE OR DEFAULT ON OBLIGATIONS, RENEGOTIATE TERMS UNILATERALLY, OR

EXPROPRIATE ASSETS.

LEGAL REMEDIES AVAILABLE TO COMPENSATE US FOR EXPROPRIATION OR OTHER TAKINGS MAY BE INADEQUATE.

WE ALSO MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY THE OUTCOME OF LITIGATION OR OTHER LEGAL PROCEEDINGS, ESPECIALLY IN COUNTRIES SUCH AS THE UNITED

STATES IN WHICH VERY LARGE AND UNPREDICTABLE PUNITIVE DAMAGE AWARDS MAY OCCUR.

SECURITY CONCERNS.

SUCCESSFUL OPERATION OF

PARTICULAR FACILITIES OR PROJECTS MAY BE DISRUPTED BY CIVIL UNREST, ACTS OF SABOTAGE OR TERRORISM, AND OTHER LOCAL SECURITY CONCERNS. SUCH CONCERNS MAY REQUIRE US TO INCUR GREATER COSTS FOR SECURITY OR TO SHUT DOWN OPERATIONS FOR A PERIOD OF TIME.

CLIMATE CHANGE AND GREENHOUSE GAS RESTRICTIONS.

DUE TO CONCERN OVER THE RISK OF CLIMATE CHANGE, A NUMBER OF COUNTRIES HAVE

ADOPTED, OR ARE CONSIDERING THE ADOPTION OF, REGULATORY FRAMEWORKS TO REDUCE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS. THESE INCLUDE ADOPTION OF CAP AND TRADE REGIMES, CARBON TAXES, RESTRICTIVE PERMITTING, INCREASED EFFICIENCY STANDARDS, AND INCENTIVES OR MANDATES

FOR RENEWABLE ENERGY. THESE REQUIREMENTS COULD MAKE OUR PRODUCTS MORE EXPENSIVE, LENGTHEN PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION TIMES, AND REDUCE DEMAND FOR HYDROCARBONS, AS WELL AS SHIFTING HYDROCARBON DEMAND TOWARD RELATIVELY LOWER-CARBON SOURCES SUCH AS NATURAL

GAS. CURRENT AND PENDING GREENHOUSE GAS REGULATIONS MAY ALSO INCREASE OUR COMPLIANCE COSTS, SUCH AS FOR MONITORING OR SEQUESTERING EMISSIONS.

GOVERNMENT SPONSORSHIP OF ALTERNATIVE ENERGY.

MANY GOVERNMENTS ARE PROVIDING TAX ADVANTAGES AND OTHER SUBSIDIES AND MANDATES TO MAKE ALTERNATIVE ENERGY SOURCES MORE COMPETITIVE AGAINST OIL AND GAS.

GOVERNMENTS ARE ALSO PROMOTING RESEARCH INTO NEW TECHNOLOGIES TO REDUCE THE COST AND INCREASE THE SCALABILITY OF ALTERNATIVE ENERGY SOURCES. WE ARE CONDUCTING OUR OWN RESEARCH EFFORTS INTO ALTERNATIVE ENERGY, SUCH AS THROUGH SPONSORSHIP OF THE

GLOBAL CLIMATE AND ENERGY PROJECT AT STANFORD UNIVERSITY AND RESEARCH INTO HYDROGEN FUEL CELLS AND FUEL-PRODUCING ALGAE. OUR FUTURE RESULTS MAY DEPEND IN PART ON THE SUCCESS OF OUR RESEARCH EFFORTS AND ON OUR ABILITY TO ADAPT AND APPLY THE STRENGTHS

OF OUR CURRENT BUSINESS MODEL TO PROVIDING THE COMPETITIVE ENERGY PRODUCTS OF THE FUTURE. SEE MANAGEMENT EFFECTIVENESS BELOW.

MANAGEMENT

EFFECTIVENESS

IN ADDITION TO EXTERNAL ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL FACTORS, OUR FUTURE BUSINESS RESULTS ALSO DEPEND ON OUR ABILITY TO

MANAGE SUCCESSFULLY THOSE FACTORS THAT ARE AT LEAST IN PART WITHIN OUR CONTROL. THE EXTENT TO WHICH WE MANAGE THESE FACTORS WILL IMPACT OUR PERFORMANCE RELATIVE TO COMPETITION. FOR PROJECTS IN WHICH WE ARE NOT THE OPERATOR, WE DEPEND ON THE

MANAGEMENT EFFECTIVENESS OF ONE OR MORE CO-VENTURERS WHOM WE DO NOT CONTROL.

EXPLORATION AND DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM.

OUR ABILITY

TO MAINTAIN AND GROW OUR OIL AND GAS PRODUCTION DEPENDS ON THE SUCCESS OF OUR EXPLORATION AND DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS. AMONG OTHER FACTORS, WE MUST CONTINUOUSLY IMPROVE OUR ABILITY TO IDENTIFY THE MOST PROMISING RESOURCE PROSPECTS AND APPLY OUR PROJECT

MANAGEMENT EXPERTISE TO BRING DISCOVERED RESOURCES ON LINE ON SCHEDULE.

PROJECT MANAGEMENT.

THE SUCCESS OF EXXONMOBILS

UPSTREAM, DOWNSTREAM, AND CHEMICAL BUSINESSES DEPENDS ON COMPLEX, LONG-TERM, CAPITAL INTENSIVE PROJECTS. THESE PROJECTS IN TURN REQUIRE A HIGH DEGREE OF PROJECT MANAGEMENT EXPERTISE TO MAXIMIZE EFFICIENCY. SPECIFIC FACTORS THAT CAN AFFECT THE

PERFORMANCE OF MAJOR PROJECTS INCLUDE OUR ABILITY TO: NEGOTIATE SUCCESSFULLY WITH JOINT VENTURERS, PARTNERS, GOVERNMENTS, SUPPLIERS, CUSTOMERS, OR OTHERS; MODEL AND OPTIMIZE RESERVOIR PERFORMANCE; DEVELOP MARKETS FOR PROJECT OUTPUTS, WHETHER THROUGH

LONG-TERM CONTRACTS OR THE DEVELOPMENT OF EFFECTIVE SPOT MARKETS; MANAGE CHANGES IN OPERATING CONDITIONS AND COSTS, INCLUDING

3

TABLE OF CONTENTS

INDEX TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

COSTS OF THIRD PARTY EQUIPMENT OR SERVICES SUCH AS DRILLING RIGS AND SHIPPING; PREVENT, TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE, AND RESPOND EFFECTIVELY TO UNFORESEEN TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES THAT COULD DELAY

PROJECT STARTUP OR CAUSE UNSCHEDULED PROJECT DOWNTIME; AND INFLUENCE THE PERFORMANCE OF PROJECT OPERATORS WHERE EXXONMOBIL DOES NOT PERFORM THAT ROLE.

OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCY.

AN IMPORTANT COMPONENT OF EXXONMOBILS COMPETITIVE PERFORMANCE, ESPECIALLY GIVEN THE COMMODITY-BASED NATURE OF MANY OF OUR BUSINESSES, IS OUR ABILITY TO OPERATE EFFICIENTLY,

INCLUDING OUR ABILITY TO MANAGE EXPENSES AND IMPROVE PRODUCTION YIELDS ON AN ONGOING BASIS. THIS REQUIRES CONTINUOUS MANAGEMENT FOCUS, INCLUDING TECHNOLOGY IMPROVEMENTS, COST CONTROL, PRODUCTIVITY ENHANCEMENTS AND REGULAR REAPPRAISAL OF OUR ASSET

PORTFOLIO.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT.

TO MAINTAIN OUR COMPETITIVE POSITION, ESPECIALLY IN LIGHT OF THE TECHNOLOGICAL NATURE OF

OUR BUSINESSES AND THE NEED FOR CONTINUOUS EFFICIENCY IMPROVEMENT, EXXONMOBILS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ORGANIZATIONS MUST BE SUCCESSFUL AND ABLE TO ADAPT TO A CHANGING MARKET AND POLICY ENVIRONMENT.

SAFETY, BUSINESS CONTROLS, AND ENVIRONMENTAL RISK MANAGEMENT.

OUR RESULTS DEPEND ON MANAGEMENTS ABILITY TO MINIMIZE THE INHERENT

RISKS OF OIL, GAS, AND PETROCHEMICAL OPERATIONS, TO CONTROL EFFECTIVELY OUR BUSINESS ACTIVITIES AND TO MINIMIZE THE POTENTIAL FOR HUMAN ERROR. WE APPLY RIGOROUS MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS AND CONTINUOUS FOCUS TO WORKPLACE SAFETY AND TO AVOIDING SPILLS OR

OTHER ADVERSE ENVIRONMENTAL EVENTS. FOR EXAMPLE, WE WORK TO MINIMIZE SPILLS THROUGH A COMBINED PROGRAM OF EFFECTIVE OPERATIONS INTEGRITY MANAGEMENT, ONGOING UPGRADES, KEY EQUIPMENT REPLACEMENTS, AND COMPREHENSIVE INSPECTION AND SURVEILLANCE.

SIMILARLY, WE ARE IMPLEMENTING COST-EFFECTIVE NEW TECHNOLOGIES AND ADOPTING NEW OPERATING PRACTICES TO REDUCE AIR EMISSIONS, NOT ONLY IN RESPONSE TO GOVERNMENT REQUIREMENTS BUT ALSO TO ADDRESS COMMUNITY PRIORITIES. WE ALSO MAINTAIN A DISCIPLINED

FRAMEWORK OF INTERNAL CONTROLS AND APPLY A CONTROLS MANAGEMENT SYSTEM FOR MONITORING COMPLIANCE WITH THIS FRAMEWORK. SUBSTANTIAL LIABILITIES AND OTHER ADVERSE IMPACTS COULD RESULT IF OUR MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS AND CONTROLS DO NOT FUNCTION AS INTENDED.

THE ABILITY TO INSURE AGAINST SUCH RISKS IS LIMITED BY THE CAPACITY OF THE APPLICABLE INSURANCE MARKETS, WHICH MAY NOT BE SUFFICIENT.

BUSINESS RISKS ALSO INCLUDE THE RISK OF CYBERSECURITY BREACHES. IF OUR SYSTEMS FOR PROTECTING AGAINST CYBERSECURITY RISKS PROVE NOT TO BE

SUFFICIENT, EXXONMOBIL COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED SUCH AS BY HAVING ITS BUSINESS SYSTEMS COMPROMISED, ITS PROPRIETARY INFORMATION ALTERED, LOST OR STOLEN, OR ITS BUSINESS OPERATIONS DISRUPTED.

PREPAREDNESS.

OUR OPERATIONS MAY BE DISRUPTED BY SEVERE WEATHER EVENTS, NATURAL DISASTERS, HUMAN ERROR, AND SIMILAR EVENTS. FOR EXAMPLE,

HURRICANES MAY DAMAGE OUR OFFSHORE PRODUCTION FACILITIES OR COASTAL REFINING AND PETROCHEMICAL PLANTS IN VULNERABLE AREAS. OUR ABILITY TO MITIGATE THE ADVERSE IMPACTS OF THESE EVENTS DEPENDS IN PART UPON THE EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR RIGOROUS DISASTER

PREPAREDNESS AND RESPONSE PLANNING, AS WELL AS BUSINESS CONTINUITY PLANNING.

PROJECTIONS, ESTIMATES AND DESCRIPTIONS OF

EXXONMOBILS PLANS AND OBJECTIVES INCLUDED OR INCORPORATED IN ITEMS 1, 1A, 2, 7 AND 7A OF THIS REPORT ARE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS. ACTUAL FUTURE RESULTS, INCLUDING PROJECT COMPLETION DATES, PRODUCTION RATES, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, COSTS AND

BUSINESS PLANS COULD DIFFER MATERIALLY DUE TO, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE FACTORS DISCUSSED ABOVE AND ELSEWHERE IN THIS REPORT.

ITEM 1B.

UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS.

AS IN OTHER

YEARS, WE RECEIVED COMMENTS FROM THE SEC STAFF REGARDING OUR FORM 10-K FOR 2010. WE RECEIVED AN INITIAL LETTER FROM THE STAFF ON JULY 5, 2011, WHICH INCLUDED COMMENTS AND REQUESTS FOR SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION ON A VARIETY OF TOPICS. WE

RESPONDED TO THESE COMMENTS ON AUGUST 25, 2011. ON DECEMBER 7, 2011, WE RECEIVED SEVERAL FOLLOW-UP COMMENTS FROM THE STAFF, TO WHICH WE RESPONDED ON JANUARY 11, 2012. ON FEBRUARY 7, 2012, WE RECEIVED ONE FOLLOW-UP COMMENT FROM THE STAFF,

TO WHICH WE RESPONDED ON FEBRUARY 21, 2012. WE DO NOT BELIEVE THE REMAINING COMMENT IS MATERIAL AND EXPECT IT TO BE FULLY RESOLVED IN THE NEAR FUTURE. DISCLOSURES RESPONSIVE TO THE SEC STAFFS COMMENTS HAVE BEEN INCLUDED IN THIS REPORT.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

INDEX TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

IN THE PRECEDING RESERVES INFORMATION, CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARY AND EQUITY COMPANY RESERVES ARE

REPORTED SEPARATELY. HOWEVER, THE CORPORATION OPERATES ITS BUSINESS WITH THE SAME VIEW OF EQUITY COMPANY RESERVES AS IT HAS FOR RESERVES FROM CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES.

THE CORPORATIONS OVERALL VOLUME CAPACITY OUTLOOK, BASED ON PROJECTS COMING ON STREAM AS ANTICIPATED, IS FOR PRODUCTION CAPACITY TO GROW OVER THE PERIOD 2012-2016. HOWEVER, ACTUAL VOLUMES WILL VARY FROM

YEAR TO YEAR DUE TO THE TIMING OF INDIVIDUAL PROJECT START-UPS, OPERATIONAL OUTAGES, RESERVOIR PERFORMANCE, REGULATORY CHANGES, ASSET SALES, WEATHER EVENTS, PRICE EFFECTS ON PRODUCTION SHARING CONTRACTS AND OTHER FACTORS AS DESCRIBED IN ITEM

1ARISK FACTORS OF THIS REPORT.

THE ESTIMATION OF PROVED RESERVES, WHICH IS BASED ON THE REQUIREMENT OF REASONABLE CERTAINTY,

IS AN ONGOING PROCESS BASED ON RIGOROUS TECHNICAL EVALUATIONS, COMMERCIAL AND MARKET ASSESSMENTS AND DETAILED ANALYSIS OF WELL INFORMATION SUCH AS FLOW RATES AND RESERVOIR PRESSURE DECLINES. FURTHERMORE, THE CORPORATION ONLY RECORDS PROVED RESERVES

FOR PROJECTS WHICH HAVE RECEIVED SIGNIFICANT FUNDING COMMITMENTS BY MANAGEMENT MADE TOWARD THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE RESERVES. ALTHOUGH THE CORPORATION IS REASONABLY CERTAIN THAT PROVED RESERVES WILL BE PRODUCED, THE TIMING AND AMOUNT RECOVERED CAN BE

AFFECTED BY A NUMBER OF FACTORS INCLUDING COMPLETION OF DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS, RESERVOIR PERFORMANCE, REGULATORY APPROVALS AND SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN PROJECTIONS OF LONG-TERM OIL AND GAS PRICE LEVELS.

B. TECHNOLOGIES USED IN ESTABLISHING PROVED RESERVES ADDITIONS IN 2011

ADDITIONS TO EXXONMOBILS PROVED RESERVES IN 2011 WERE BASED ON ESTIMATES GENERATED THROUGH THE INTEGRATION OF AVAILABLE AND APPROPRIATE

GEOLOGICAL, ENGINEERING AND PRODUCTION DATA, UTILIZING WELL-ESTABLISHED TECHNOLOGIES THAT HAVE BEEN DEMONSTRATED IN THE FIELD TO YIELD REPEATABLE AND CONSISTENT RESULTS.

DATA USED IN THESE INTEGRATED ASSESSMENTS INCLUDED INFORMATION OBTAINED DIRECTLY FROM THE SUBSURFACE VIA WELLBORES, SUCH AS WELL LOGS, RESERVOIR CORE SAMPLES, FLUID SAMPLES, STATIC AND DYNAMIC PRESSURE

INFORMATION, PRODUCTION TEST DATA, AND SURVEILLANCE AND PERFORMANCE INFORMATION. THE DATA UTILIZED ALSO INCLUDED SUBSURFACE INFORMATION OBTAINED THROUGH INDIRECT MEASUREMENTS INCLUDING HIGH-QUALITY 2-D AND 3-D SEISMIC DATA, CALIBRATED WITH AVAILABLE

WELL CONTROL INFORMATION. WHERE APPLICABLE, SURFACE GEOLOGICAL INFORMATION WAS ALSO UTILIZED. THE TOOLS USED TO INTERPRET THE DATA INCLUDED PROPRIETARY SEISMIC PROCESSING SOFTWARE, PROPRIETARY RESERVOIR MODELING AND SIMULATION SOFTWARE AND

COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE DATA ANALYSIS PACKAGES.

IN SOME CIRCUMSTANCES, WHERE APPROPRIATE ANALOG RESERVOIRS WERE AVAILABLE, RESERVOIR

PARAMETERS FROM THESE ANALOGS WERE USED TO INCREASE THE QUALITY OF AND CONFIDENCE IN THE RESERVES ESTIMATES.

C. QUALIFICATIONS OF

RESERVES TECHNICAL OVERSIGHT GROUP AND INTERNAL CONTROLS OVER PROVED RESERVES

EXXONMOBIL HAS A DEDICATED RESERVES TECHNICAL

OVERSIGHT GROUP THAT IS SEPARATE FROM THE OPERATING ORGANIZATION. PRIMARY RESPONSIBILITIES OF THIS GROUP INCLUDE OVERSIGHT OF THE RESERVES ESTIMATION PROCESS FOR COMPLIANCE WITH SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (SEC) RULES AND REGULATIONS, REVIEW

OF ANNUAL CHANGES IN RESERVES ESTIMATES, AND THE REPORTING OF EXXONMOBILS PROVED RESERVES. THIS GROUP ALSO MAINTAINS THE OFFICIAL COMPANY RESERVES ESTIMATES FOR EXXONMOBILS PROVED RESERVES OF CRUDE AND NATURAL GAS LIQUIDS, BITUMEN,

SYNTHETIC OIL AND NATURAL GAS. IN ADDITION, THE GROUP PROVIDES TRAINING TO PERSONNEL INVOLVED IN THE RESERVES ESTIMATION AND REPORTING PROCESS WITHIN EXXONMOBIL AND ITS AFFILIATES. THE GROUP IS MANAGED BY AND STAFFED WITH INDIVIDUALS THAT HAVE AN

AVERAGE OF MORE THAN 20 YEARS OF TECHNICAL EXPERIENCE IN THE PETROLEUM INDUSTRY, INCLUDING EXPERTISE IN THE CLASSIFICATION AND CATEGORIZATION OF RESERVES UNDER THE SEC GUIDELINES. THIS GROUP INCLUDES SEVERAL INDIVIDUALS WHO HOLD ADVANCED DEGREES IN

EITHER ENGINEERING OR GEOLOGY, AS WELL AS INDIVIDUALS WHO HOLD BACHELORS DEGREES IN VARIOUS TECHNICAL DISCIPLINES. SEVERAL MEMBERS OF THE GROUP HOLD PROFESSIONAL REGISTRATIONS IN THEIR FIELD OF EXPERTISE AND SEVERAL HAVE SERVED ON THE OIL AND

GAS RESERVES COMMITTEE OF THE SOCIETY OF PETROLEUM ENGINEERS.

THE RESERVES TECHNICAL OVERSIGHT GROUP MAINTAINS A CENTRAL

COMPUTERIZED DATABASE CONTAINING THE OFFICIAL COMPANY GLOBAL RESERVES ESTIMATES. APPROPRIATE CONTROLS, INCLUDING LIMITATIONS ON DATABASE ACCESS AND UPDATE CAPABILITIES, ARE IN PLACE TO ENSURE DATA INTEGRITY WITHIN THIS CENTRAL COMPUTERIZED DATABASE.

AN ANNUAL REVIEW OF THE SYSTEMS CONTROLS IS PERFORMED BY INTERNAL AUDIT. KEY COMPONENTS OF THE RESERVES ESTIMATION PROCESS INCLUDE TECHNICAL EVALUATIONS AND ANALYSIS OF WELL AND FIELD PERFORMANCE AND A RIGOROUS PEER REVIEW. NO CHANGES MAY BE

MADE TO THE RESERVES ESTIMATES IN THE CENTRAL DATABASE, INCLUDING ADDITIONS OF ANY NEW INITIAL RESERVES ESTIMATES OR SUBSEQUENT REVISIONS, UNLESS THESE CHANGES HAVE BEEN THOROUGHLY REVIEWED AND EVALUATED BY DULY AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL WITHIN THE

OPERATING ORGANIZATION. IN ADDITION, CHANGES TO RESERVES ESTIMATES THAT EXCEED CERTAIN THRESHOLDS REQUIRE FURTHER REVIEW AND APPROVAL OF THE APPROPRIATE LEVEL OF MANAGEMENT WITHIN THE OPERATING ORGANIZATION BEFORE THE CHANGES MAY BE MADE IN THE

CENTRAL DATABASE. ENDORSEMENT BY THE RESERVES TECHNICAL OVERSIGHT GROUP FOR ALL PROVED RESERVES CHANGES IS A MANDATORY COMPONENT OF THIS REVIEW PROCESS. AFTER ALL CHANGES ARE MADE, REVIEWS ARE HELD WITH SENIOR MANAGEMENT FOR FINAL ENDORSEMENT.

2. PROVED UNDEVELOPED RESERVES

AT YEAR-END 2011, APPROXIMATELY 8.8 BILLION OIL-EQUIVALENT BARRELS (GOEB) OF EXXONMOBILS PROVED RESERVES WERE CLASSIFIED AS PROVED UNDEVELOPED. THIS REPRESENTS 35 PERCENT OF THE 24.9 GOEB REPORTED IN

PROVED RESERVES. THIS COMPARES TO THE 7.7 GOEB OF PROVED UNDEVELOPED RESERVES REPORTED AT THE END OF 2010. THE NET INCREASE OF 1.1 GOEB IS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE ADDITION OF NEW PROJECTS IN CANADA AND THE UNITED STATES. DURING THE YEAR, EXXONMOBIL

CONDUCTED DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES IN OVER 100 FIELDS THAT RESULTED IN THE TRANSFER OF APPROXIMATELY 0.5 GOEB FROM PROVED UNDEVELOPED TO PROVED DEVELOPED RESERVES BY YEAR-END. THE LARGEST INDIVIDUAL TRANSFER WAS RELATED TO COMPLETION OF DRILLING AND

THE INITIATION OF PRODUCTION ACTIVITIES ON NEW PAD LOCATIONS IN THE COLD LAKE FIELD IN CANADA.

ONE OF EXXONMOBILS REQUIREMENTS

FOR REPORTING PROVED RESERVES IS THAT MANAGEMENT HAS MADE SIGNIFICANT FUNDING COMMITMENTS TOWARD THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE RESERVES. EXXONMOBIL HAS A DISCIPLINED INVESTMENT STRATEGY AND MANY MAJOR FIELDS REQUIRE LONG LEAD-TIME IN ORDER TO BE DEVELOPED.

DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS TYPICALLY TAKE TWO TO FOUR YEARS FROM THE TIME OF FIRST RECORDING OF PROVED RESERVES TO THE START OF PRODUCTION OF THESE RESERVES. HOWEVER, THE DEVELOPMENT TIME FOR LARGE AND COMPLEX PROJECTS CAN EXCEED FIVE YEARS. DURING 2011,

DISCOVERIES AND EXTENSIONS RELATED TO NEW PROJECTS ADDED APPROXIMATELY 1.5 GOEB OF PROVED UNDEVELOPED RESERVES. THE LARGEST OF THESE ADDITIONS WERE RELATED TO THE KEARL EXPANSION PROJECT IN CANADA AND ADDITIONS FOR PLANNED DRILLING IN THE UNITED

STATES. OVERALL, INVESTMENTS OF $23.1 BILLION WERE MADE BY THE CORPORATION DURING 2011 TO PROGRESS THE DEVELOPMENT OF REPORTED PROVED UNDEVELOPED RESERVES, INCLUDING $20.5 BILLION FOR OIL AND GAS PRODUCING ACTIVITIES AND AN ADDITIONAL $2.6 BILLION

FOR OTHER NON-OIL AND GAS PRODUCING ACTIVITIES SUCH AS THE CONSTRUCTION OF LNG TRAINS, SUPPORT INFRASTRUCTURE AND OTHER RELATED FACILITIES THAT WERE UNDERTAKEN TO PROGRESS THE DEVELOPMENT OF PROVED UNDEVELOPED RESERVES. THESE INVESTMENTS REPRESENTED

70 PERCENT OF THE $33.1 BILLION IN TOTAL REPORTED UPSTREAM CAPITAL AND EXPLORATION EXPENDITURES.

PROVED UNDEVELOPED RESERVES IN THE

UNITED STATES, KAZAKHSTAN, THE NETHERLANDS, NIGERIA AND CANADA HAVE REMAINED UNDEVELOPED FOR FIVE YEARS OR MORE PRIMARILY DUE TO CONSTRAINTS ON THE CAPACITY OF INFRASTRUCTURE AND THE PACE OF CO-VENTURER/GOVERNMENT FUNDING, AS WELL AS THE TIME

REQUIRED TO COMPLETE DEVELOPMENT FOR VERY LARGE PROJECTS. THE CORPORATION IS REASONABLY CERTAIN THAT THESE PROVED RESERVES WILL BE PRODUCED; HOWEVER, THE TIMING AND AMOUNT RECOVERED CAN BE AFFECTED BY A NUMBER OF FACTORS INCLUDING COMPLETION OF

DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS, RESERVOIR PERFORMANCE AND REGULATORY APPROVALS. APPROXIMATELY ONE-THIRD OF THE PROVED UNDEVELOPED RESERVES THAT HAVE BEEN REPORTED FOR FIVE OR MORE YEARS ARE LOCATED IN THREE FIELDS IN KAZAKHSTAN AND THE NETHERLANDS. IN

KAZAKHSTAN, THE FIRST IS THE INITIAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE GIANT OFFSHORE KASHAGAN FIELD WHICH IS INCLUDED IN THE NORTH CASPIAN PRODUCTION SHARING AGREEMENT IN WHICH EXXONMOBIL PARTICIPATES. THE SECOND IS THE TENGIZCHEVROIL JOINT VENTURE WHICH INCLUDES

A PRODUCTION LICENSE IN THE TENGIZ FIELD AND THE NEARBY KOROLEV FIELD. THE JOINT VENTURE IS PRODUCING AND PROVED UNDEVELOPED RESERVES WILL CONTINUE TO MOVE TO PROVED DEVELOPED AS APPROVED DEVELOPMENT PHASES PROGRESS. THE THIRD IS THE GRONINGEN GAS

FIELD IN THE NETHERLANDS. PROVED UNDEVELOPED RESERVES REPORTED FOR THIS FIELD ARE RELATED TO INSTALLATION OF FUTURE STAGES OF COMPRESSION. THESE RESERVES WILL MOVE TO PROVED DEVELOPED WHEN THE ADDITIONAL STAGES OF COMPRESSION ARE INSTALLED TO

MAINTAIN FIELD DELIVERY PRESSURE.

THE KEARL PROJECT IS A JOINT VENTURE ESTABLISHED TO RECOVER SHALLOW DEPOSITS

OF OIL SANDS USING OPEN-PIT MINING METHODS TO EXTRACT THE CRUDE BITUMEN. IMPERIAL OIL LIMITED HOLDS A 70.96 PERCENT INTEREST IN THE JOINT VENTURE AND EXXONMOBIL CANADA PROPERTIES HOLDS THE OTHER 29.04 PERCENT. EXXON MOBIL CORPORATION HAS A 69.6

PERCENT INTEREST IN IMPERIAL OIL LIMITED AND A 100 PERCENT INTEREST IN EXXONMOBIL CANADA PROPERTIES. KEARL IS COMPRISED OF SIX OIL SANDS LEASES COVERING ABOUT 48 THOUSAND ACRES IN THE ATHABASCA OIL SANDS DEPOSIT.

THE KEARL PROJECT IS LOCATED APPROXIMATELY 40 MILES NORTH OF FORT MCMURRAY, ALBERTA, CANADA AND IS EXPECTED TO BE DEVELOPED IN TWO PHASES.

BITUMEN WILL BE EXTRACTED FROM OIL SANDS PRODUCED FROM OPEN-PIT MINING OPERATIONS, AND PROCESSED THROUGH A BITUMEN EXTRACTION AND FROTH TREATMENT PLANT. THE PRODUCT, A BLEND OF BITUMEN AND DILUENT, IS PLANNED TO BE SHIPPED VIA PIPELINES FOR

DISTRIBUTION TO NORTH AMERICAN MARKETS. DILUENT IS NATURAL GAS CONDENSATE OR OTHER LIGHT HYDROCARBONS ADDED TO THE CRUDE BITUMEN TO FACILITATE TRANSPORTATION TO MARKET BY PIPELINE. AT YEAR-END 2011, THE INITIAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE KEARL PROJECT WAS

MORE THAN 85 PERCENT COMPLETE WITH EXPECTED STARTUP IN 2012. THE KEARL EXPANSION PROJECT WAS FUNDED IN 2011.

EXXONMOBILS INVESTMENT IN DEVELOPED AND UNDEVELOPED ACREAGE IS COMPRISED OF NUMEROUS CONCESSIONS,

BLOCKS AND LEASES. THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH THE CORPORATION MAINTAINS EXPLORATION AND/OR PRODUCTION RIGHTS TO THE ACREAGE ARE PROPERTY-SPECIFIC, CONTRACTUALLY DEFINED AND VARY SIGNIFICANTLY FROM PROPERTY TO PROPERTY. WORK PROGRAMS ARE

DESIGNED TO ENSURE THAT THE EXPLORATION POTENTIAL OF ANY PROPERTY IS FULLY EVALUATED BEFORE EXPIRATION. IN SOME INSTANCES, THE CORPORATION MAY ELECT TO RELINQUISH ACREAGE IN ADVANCE OF THE CONTRACTUAL EXPIRATION DATE IF THE EVALUATION PROCESS IS

COMPLETE AND THERE IS NOT A BUSINESS BASIS FOR EXTENSION. IN CASES WHERE ADDITIONAL TIME MAY BE REQUIRED TO FULLY EVALUATE ACREAGE, THE CORPORATION HAS GENERALLY BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN OBTAINING EXTENSIONS. THE SCHEDULED EXPIRATION OF LEASES AND

CONCESSIONS FOR UNDEVELOPED ACREAGE OVER THE NEXT THREE YEARS IS NOT EXPECTED TO HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON THE CORPORATION.

D. SUMMARY OF ACREAGE TERMS

UNITED STATES

OIL AND

GAS LEASES HAVE AN EXPLORATION PERIOD RANGING FROM ONE TO TEN YEARS, AND A PRODUCTION PERIOD THAT NORMALLY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL PRODUCTION CEASES. UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES, A LEASE MAY BE HELD BEYOND ITS EXPLORATION TERM EVEN IF PRODUCTION HAS

NOT COMMENCED. IN SOME INSTANCES, A FEE INTEREST IS ACQUIRED WHERE BOTH THE SURFACE AND THE UNDERLYING MINERAL INTERESTS ARE OWNED OUTRIGHT.

CANADA / SOUTH AMERICA

CANADA

EXPLORATION LICENSES OR LEASES ARE ACQUIRED FOR VARYING PERIODS OF TIME WITH RENEWALS OR EXTENSIONS POSSIBLE. EXPLORATION RIGHTS IN ONSHORE AREAS

ACQUIRED FROM CANADIAN PROVINCES ENTITLE THE HOLDER TO CONTINUE EXISTING LICENSES OR LEASES UPON COMPLETING SPECIFIED WORK. IN GENERAL, LICENSE AND LEASE AGREEMENTS ARE HELD AS LONG AS THERE IS PRODUCTION ON THE LICENSES AND LEASES. THE MAJORITY OF

COLD LAKE LEASES ARE HELD IN THIS MANNER. THE EXPLORATION ACREAGE IN EASTERN CANADA AND THE BLOCK IN THE BEAUFORT SEA ACQUIRED IN 2007 ARE CURRENTLY HELD BY WORK COMMITMENTS OF VARIOUS AMOUNTS.

ARGENTINA

THE FEDERAL

ONSHORE CONCESSION TERMS IN ARGENTINA ARE UP TO FOUR YEARS FOR THE INITIAL EXPLORATION PERIOD, UP TO THREE YEARS FOR THE SECOND EXPLORATION PERIOD AND UP TO TWO YEARS FOR THE THIRD EXPLORATION PERIOD. A 50-PERCENT RELINQUISHMENT IS REQUIRED AFTER

EACH EXPLORATION PERIOD. AN EXTENSION AFTER THE THIRD EXPLORATION PERIOD IS POSSIBLE FOR UP TO FIVE YEARS. THE TOTAL PRODUCTION TERM IS 25 YEARS WITH A TEN-YEAR EXTENSION POSSIBLE, ONCE A FIELD HAS BEEN DEVELOPED. ARGENTINE PROVINCES ARE ENTITLED TO

MODIFY THE CONCESSION TERMS GRANTED WITHIN THEIR TERRITORIES. THE CONCESSION TERMS OF THE EXPLORATION PERMITS GRANTED BY NEUQUEN PROVINCE ARE UP TO SIX YEARS FOR THE INITIAL EXPLORATION PERIOD, UP TO FOUR YEARS FOR THE SECOND EXPLORATION PERIOD AND

UP TO THREE YEARS FOR THE THIRD EXPLORATION PERIOD DEPENDING ON THE CLASSIFICATION OF THE AREA. AN EXTENSION AFTER THE THIRD EXPLORATION PERIOD IS POSSIBLE FOR UP TO ONE YEAR.

EUROPE

GERMANY

EXPLORATION CONCESSIONS ARE GRANTED FOR AN INITIAL MAXIMUM PERIOD OF FIVE YEARS, WITH AN UNLIMITED NUMBER OF EXTENSIONS OF UP TO THREE YEARS

EACH. EXTENSIONS ARE SUBJECT TO SPECIFIC, MINIMUM WORK COMMITMENTS. PRODUCTION LICENSES ARE NORMALLY GRANTED FOR 20 TO 25 YEARS WITH MULTIPLE POSSIBLE EXTENSIONS AS LONG AS THERE IS PRODUCTION ON THE LICENSE. IN 2007, EXXONMOBIL AFFILIATES ACQUIRED

FOUR EXPLORATION LICENSES IN THE STATE OF LOWER SAXONY. THE EXPLORATION LICENSES ARE FOR A PERIOD OF FIVE YEARS DURING WHICH EXPLORATION WORK PROGRAMS WILL BE CARRIED OUT. IN 2009, EXXONMOBIL AFFILIATES ACQUIRED TWO EXPLORATION LICENSES IN THE STATE

OF NORTH RHINE WESTPHALIA FOR AN INITIAL PERIOD OF FIVE YEARS AND AN EXTENSION TO ONE OF THE LOWER SAXONY LICENSES.

NETHERLANDS

UNDER THE MINING LAW, EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2003, EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION LICENSES FOR BOTH ONSHORE AND OFFSHORE AREAS ARE

ISSUED FOR A PERIOD AS EXPLICITLY DEFINED IN THE LICENSE. THE TERM IS BASED ON THE PERIOD OF TIME NECESSARY TO PERFORM THE ACTIVITIES FOR WHICH THE LICENSE IS ISSUED. LICENSE CONDITIONS ARE STIPULATED IN THE LICENSE AND ARE BASED ON THE MINING LAW.

PRODUCTION RIGHTS GRANTED PRIOR TO JANUARY 1, 2003, REMAIN SUBJECT TO THEIR EXISTING TERMS, AND DIFFER SLIGHTLY FOR ONSHORE AND

OFFSHORE AREAS. ONSHORE PRODUCTION LICENSES ISSUED PRIOR TO 1988 WERE INDEFINITE; FROM 1988 THEY WERE ISSUED FOR A PERIOD AS EXPLICITLY DEFINED IN THE LICENSE, RANGING FROM 35 TO 45 YEARS. OFFSHORE PRODUCTION LICENSES ISSUED BEFORE 1976 WERE ISSUED

FOR A FIXED PERIOD OF 40 YEARS; FROM 1976 THEY WERE AGAIN ISSUED FOR A PERIOD AS EXPLICITLY DEFINED IN THE LICENSE, RANGING FROM 15 TO 40 YEARS.

NORWAY

LICENSES ISSUED PRIOR TO 1972 WERE FOR AN INITIAL PERIOD OF SIX YEARS AND AN

EXTENSION PERIOD OF 40 YEARS, WITH RELINQUISHMENT OF AT LEAST ONE-FOURTH OF THE ORIGINAL AREA REQUIRED AT THE END OF THE SIXTH YEAR AND ANOTHER ONE-FOURTH AT THE END OF THE NINTH YEAR. LICENSES ISSUED BETWEEN 1972 AND 1997 WERE FOR AN INITIAL PERIOD

OF UP TO SIX YEARS (WITH EXTENSION OF THE INITIAL PERIOD OF ONE YEAR AT A TIME UP TO TEN YEARS AFTER 1985), AND AN EXTENSION PERIOD OF UP TO 30 YEARS, WITH RELINQUISHMENT OF AT LEAST ONE-HALF OF THE ORIGINAL AREA REQUIRED AT

THE END OF THE INITIAL PERIOD. LICENSES ISSUED AFTER JULY 1, 1997, HAVE AN INITIAL PERIOD OF UP TO TEN YEARS AND A NORMAL EXTENSION PERIOD OF UP TO 30 YEARS OR IN SPECIAL CASES OF UP TO 50 YEARS,

AND WITH RELINQUISHMENT OF AT LEAST ONE-HALF OF THE ORIGINAL AREA REQUIRED AT THE END OF THE INITIAL PERIOD.

UNITED KINGDOM

ACREAGE TERMS ARE FIXED BY THE GOVERNMENT AND ARE PERIODICALLY CHANGED. FOR EXAMPLE, MANY OF THE EARLY LICENSES ISSUED UNDER THE

FIRST FOUR LICENSING ROUNDS PROVIDED FOR AN INITIAL TERM OF SIX YEARS WITH RELINQUISHMENT OF AT LEAST ONE-HALF OF THE ORIGINAL AREA AT THE END OF THE INITIAL TERM, SUBJECT TO EXTENSION FOR A FURTHER 40 YEARS. AT THE END OF ANY SUCH 40-YEAR TERM,

LICENSES MAY CONTINUE IN PRODUCING AREAS UNTIL CESSATION OF PRODUCTION; OR LICENSES MAY CONTINUE IN DEVELOPMENT AREAS FOR PERIODS AGREED ON A CASE-BY-CASE BASIS UNTIL THEY BECOME PRODUCING AREAS; OR LICENSES TERMINATE IN ALL OTHER AREAS. THE

LICENSING REGIME WAS LAST UPDATED IN 2002, AND THE MAJORITY OF LICENSES ISSUED HAVE AN INITIAL TERM OF FOUR YEARS WITH A SECOND TERM EXTENSION OF FOUR YEARS AND A FINAL TERM OF 18 YEARS WITH A MANDATORY RELINQUISHMENT OF 50 PERCENT OF THE ACREAGE

AFTER THE INITIAL TERM AND OF ALL ACREAGE THAT IS NOT COVERED BY A DEVELOPMENT PLAN AT THE END OF THE SECOND TERM.

AFRICA

ANGOLA

EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION ACTIVITIES ARE GOVERNED BY PRODUCTION SHARING AGREEMENTS WITH AN INITIAL EXPLORATION TERM OF FOUR YEARS AND AN

OPTIONAL SECOND PHASE OF TWO TO THREE YEARS. THE PRODUCTION PERIOD IS FOR 25 YEARS, AND AGREEMENTS GENERALLY PROVIDE FOR A NEGOTIATED EXTENSION.

CHAD

EXPLORATION PERMITS ARE ISSUED FOR A PERIOD OF FIVE YEARS, AND ARE RENEWABLE FOR

GOVERNMENT.

EQUATORIAL GUINEA

EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION ACTIVITIES ARE GOVERNED BY PRODUCTION SHARING CONTRACTS NEGOTIATED WITH THE STATE MINISTRY OF MINES, INDUSTRY AND ENERGY. THE EXPLORATION PERIODS ARE FOR TEN TO 15 YEARS WITH LIMITED

RELINQUISHMENTS IN THE ABSENCE OF COMMERCIAL DISCOVERIES. THE PRODUCTION PERIOD FOR CRUDE OIL IS 30 YEARS WHILE THE PRODUCTION PERIOD FOR GAS IS 50 YEARS. UNDER THE HYDROCARBONS LAW ENACTED IN 2006, THE EXPLORATION TERMS FOR NEW PRODUCTION SHARING

CONTRACTS ARE FOUR TO FIVE YEARS WITH A MAXIMUM OF TWO ONE-YEAR EXTENSIONS, UNLESS THE MINISTRY AGREES OTHERWISE.

EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION ACTIVITIES IN THE DEEPWATER OFFSHORE AREAS ARE TYPICALLY GOVERNED BY PRODUCTION SHARING CONTRACTS

(PSCS) WITH THE NATIONAL OIL COMPANY, THE NIGERIAN NATIONAL PETROLEUM CORPORATION (NNPC). NNPC HOLDS THE UNDERLYING OIL PROSPECTING LICENSE (OPL) AND ANY RESULTING OIL MINING LEASE (OML). THE TERMS OF THE PSCS ARE GENERALLY 30 YEARS, INCLUDING A

TEN-YEAR EXPLORATION PERIOD (AN INITIAL EXPLORATION PHASE PLUS ONE OR TWO OPTIONAL PERIODS) COVERED BY AN OPL. UPON COMMERCIAL DISCOVERY, AN OPL MAY BE CONVERTED TO AN OML. PARTIAL RELINQUISHMENT IS REQUIRED UNDER THE PSC AT THE END OF THE TEN-YEAR

EXPLORATION PERIOD, AND OMLS HAVE A 20-YEAR PRODUCTION PERIOD THAT MAY BE EXTENDED.

SOME EXPLORATION ACTIVITIES ARE CARRIED OUT IN

DEEPWATER BY JOINT VENTURES WITH LOCAL COMPANIES HOLDING INTERESTS IN AN OPL. OPLS IN DEEPWATER OFFSHORE AREAS ARE VALID FOR TEN YEARS AND ARE NON-RENEWABLE, WHILE IN ALL OTHER AREAS THE LICENSES ARE FOR FIVE YEARS AND ALSO ARE NON-RENEWABLE.

DEMONSTRATING A COMMERCIAL DISCOVERY IS THE BASIS FOR CONVERSION OF AN OPL TO AN OML.

OMLS GRANTED PRIOR TO THE 1969 PETROLEUM ACT

(I.E., UNDER THE MINERAL OILS ACT 1914, REPEALED BY THE 1969 PETROLEUM ACT) WERE FOR 30 YEARS ONSHORE AND 40 YEARS IN OFFSHORE AREAS AND HAVE BEEN RENEWED, EFFECTIVE DECEMBER 1, 2008, FOR A FURTHER PERIOD OF 20 YEARS, WITH A FURTHER RENEWAL OPTION

OF 20 YEARS. OPERATIONS UNDER THESE PRE-1969 OMLS ARE CONDUCTED UNDER A JOINT VENTURE AGREEMENT WITH NNPC RATHER THAN A PSC. IN 2000, A MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING (MOU) WAS EXECUTED DEFINING COMMERCIAL TERMS APPLICABLE TO EXISTING JOINT VENTURE OIL

PRODUCTION. THE MOU MAY BE TERMINATED ON ONE CALENDAR YEARS NOTICE.

OMLS GRANTED UNDER THE 1969 PETROLEUM ACT, WHICH INCLUDE

ALL DEEPWATER OMLS, HAVE A MAXIMUM TERM OF 20 YEARS WITHOUT DISTINCTION FOR ONSHORE OR OFFSHORE LOCATION AND ARE RENEWABLE, UPON 12 MONTHS WRITTEN NOTICE, FOR ANOTHER PERIOD OF 20 YEARS. OMLS NOT HELD BY NNPC ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO A MANDATORY

50-PERCENT RELINQUISHMENT AFTER THE FIRST TEN YEARS OF THEIR DURATION.

CASH FLOW FROM OPERATIONS AND ASSET SALES

CASH FLOW FROM OPERATIONS AND ASSET SALES IS THE SUM OF THE NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES AND PROCEEDS ASSOCIATED WITH SALES OF SUBSIDIARIES,

PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT, AND SALES AND RETURNS OF INVESTMENTS FROM THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS. THIS CASH FLOW REFLECTS THE TOTAL SOURCES OF CASH FROM BOTH OPERATING THE CORPORATIONS ASSETS AND FROM THE DIVESTING OF ASSETS.

THE CORPORATION EMPLOYS A LONG-STANDING AND REGULAR DISCIPLINED REVIEW PROCESS TO ENSURE THAT ALL ASSETS ARE CONTRIBUTING TO THE CORPORATIONS STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES. ASSETS ARE DIVESTED WHEN THEY ARE NO LONGER MEETING THESE OBJECTIVES OR ARE

WORTH CONSIDERABLY MORE TO OTHERS. BECAUSE OF THE REGULAR NATURE OF THIS ACTIVITY, WE BELIEVE IT IS USEFUL FOR INVESTORS TO CONSIDER PROCEEDS ASSOCIATED WITH ASSET SALES TOGETHER WITH CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES WHEN EVALUATING CASH

AVAILABLE FOR INVESTMENT IN THE BUSINESS AND FINANCING ACTIVITIES, INCLUDING SHAREHOLDER DISTRIBUTIONS.

RETURN ON AVERAGE CAPITAL EMPLOYED

RETURN ON AVERAGE CAPITAL EMPLOYED (ROCE) IS A PERFORMANCE MEASURE RATIO. FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF THE BUSINESS SEGMENTS, ROCE IS ANNUAL BUSINESS SEGMENT EARNINGS DIVIDED BY AVERAGE BUSINESS SEGMENT CAPITAL

EMPLOYED (AVERAGE OF BEGINNING AND END-OF-YEAR AMOUNTS). THESE SEGMENT EARNINGS INCLUDE EXXONMOBILS SHARE OF SEGMENT EARNINGS OF EQUITY COMPANIES, CONSISTENT WITH OUR CAPITAL EMPLOYED DEFINITION, AND EXCLUDE THE COST OF FINANCING. THE

CORPORATIONS TOTAL ROCE IS NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO EXXONMOBIL EXCLUDING THE AFTER-TAX COST OF FINANCING, DIVIDED BY TOTAL CORPORATE AVERAGE CAPITAL EMPLOYED. THE CORPORATION HAS CONSISTENTLY APPLIED ITS ROCE DEFINITION FOR MANY YEARS AND

VIEWS IT AS THE BEST MEASURE OF HISTORICAL CAPITAL PRODUCTIVITY IN OUR CAPITAL-INTENSIVE, LONG-TERM INDUSTRY, BOTH TO EVALUATE MANAGEMENTS PERFORMANCE AND TO DEMONSTRATE TO SHAREHOLDERS THAT CAPITAL HAS BEEN USED WISELY OVER THE LONG TERM.

ADDITIONAL MEASURES, WHICH ARE MORE CASH FLOW BASED, ARE USED TO MAKE INVESTMENT DECISIONS.

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

STATEMENTS IN THIS DISCUSSION REGARDING EXPECTATIONS, PLANS AND FUTURE EVENTS OR CONDITIONS ARE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS. ACTUAL FUTURE RESULTS, INCLUDING

DEMAND GROWTH AND ENERGY SOURCE MIX; CAPACITY INCREASES; PRODUCTION GROWTH AND MIX; RATES OF FIELD DECLINE; FINANCING SOURCES; THE RESOLUTION OF CONTINGENCIES AND UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS; ENVIRONMENTAL AND CAPITAL EXPENDITURES; COULD DIFFER

MATERIALLY DEPENDING ON A NUMBER OF FACTORS, SUCH AS CHANGES IN THE SUPPLY OF AND DEMAND FOR CRUDE OIL, NATURAL GAS, AND PETROLEUM AND PETROCHEMICAL PRODUCTS; THE OUTCOME OF COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS; POLITICAL OR REGULATORY EVENTS, AND OTHER FACTORS

DISCUSSED HEREIN AND IN ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS.

OVERVIEW

THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF EXXONMOBILS FINANCIAL RESULTS, AS WELL AS THE ACCOMPANYING FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND RELATED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS TO WHICH THEY REFER, ARE THE

RESPONSIBILITY OF THE MANAGEMENT OF EXXON MOBIL CORPORATION. THE CORPORATIONS ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL REPORTING FAIRLY REFLECT ITS STRAIGHTFORWARD BUSINESS MODEL INVOLVING THE EXTRACTING, MANUFACTURING AND MARKETING OF HYDROCARBONS AND

HYDROCARBON-BASED PRODUCTS. THE CORPORATIONS BUSINESS MODEL INVOLVES THE PRODUCTION (OR PURCHASE), MANUFACTURE AND SALE OF PHYSICAL PRODUCTS, AND ALL COMMERCIAL ACTIVITIES ARE DIRECTLY IN SUPPORT OF THE UNDERLYING PHYSICAL MOVEMENT

OF GOODS.

EXXONMOBIL, WITH ITS RESOURCE BASE, FINANCIAL STRENGTH, DISCIPLINED INVESTMENT APPROACH AND TECHNOLOGY PORTFOLIO, IS

WELL-POSITIONED TO PARTICIPATE IN SUBSTANTIAL INVESTMENTS TO DEVELOP NEW ENERGY SUPPLIES. WHILE COMMODITY PRICES ARE VOLATILE ON A SHORT-TERM BASIS AND DEPEND ON SUPPLY AND DEMAND, EXXONMOBILS INVESTMENT DECISIONS ARE BASED ON OUR LONG-TERM

BUSINESS OUTLOOK, USING A DISCIPLINED APPROACH IN SELECTING AND PURSUING THE MOST ATTRACTIVE INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES. THE CORPORATE PLAN IS A FUNDAMENTAL ANNUAL MANAGEMENT PROCESS THAT IS THE BASIS FOR SETTING NEAR-TERM OPERATING AND CAPITAL

OBJECTIVES IN ADDITION TO PROVIDING THE LONGER-TERM ECONOMIC ASSUMPTIONS USED FOR INVESTMENT EVALUATION PURPOSES. VOLUMES ARE BASED ON INDIVIDUAL FIELD PRODUCTION PROFILES, WHICH ARE ALSO UPDATED ANNUALLY. PRICES FOR CRUDE OIL, NATURAL GAS AND

REFINED PRODUCTS ARE BASED ON CORPORATE PLAN ASSUMPTIONS DEVELOPED ANNUALLY BY MAJOR REGION AND ARE UTILIZED FOR INVESTMENT EVALUATION PURPOSES. POTENTIAL INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES ARE TESTED OVER A WIDE RANGE OF ECONOMIC SCENARIOS TO ESTABLISH THE

RESILIENCY OF EACH OPPORTUNITY. ONCE INVESTMENTS ARE MADE, A REAPPRAISAL PROCESS IS COMPLETED TO ENSURE RELEVANT LESSONS ARE LEARNED AND IMPROVEMENTS ARE INCORPORATED INTO FUTURE PROJECTS.

BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT AND RISK ASSESSMENT

LONG-TERM BUSINESS OUTLOOK

BY 2040, THE WORLDS POPULATION IS PROJECTED TO GROW TO APPROXIMATELY 8.7 BILLION PEOPLE, OR ABOUT 1.9 BILLION MORE THAN IN 2010. COINCIDENT

WITH THIS POPULATION INCREASE, THE CORPORATION EXPECTS WORLDWIDE ECONOMIC GROWTH TO AVERAGE CLOSE TO 3 PERCENT PER YEAR. EXPANDING PROSPERITY ACROSS A GROWING GLOBAL POPULATION IS EXPECTED TO COINCIDE WITH AN INCREASE IN PRIMARY ENERGY DEMAND OF

ABOUT 30 PERCENT BY 2040 VERSUS 2010, EVEN WITH SUBSTANTIAL EFFICIENCY GAINS AROUND THE WORLD. THIS DEMAND INCREASE IS EXPECTED TO BE CONCENTRATED IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES (I.E., THOSE THAT ARE NOT MEMBER NATIONS OF THE ORGANIZATION FOR ECONOMIC

COOPERATION AND DEVELOPMENT).

AS ECONOMIC PROGRESS DRIVES DEMAND HIGHER, INCREASING PENETRATION OF ENERGY-EFFICIENT AND

LOWER-EMISSION FUELS, TECHNOLOGIES AND PRACTICES ARE EXPECTED TO CONTRIBUTE TO SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER LEVELS OF ENERGY CONSUMPTION AND EMISSIONS PER UNIT OF ECONOMIC OUTPUT OVER TIME. EFFICIENCY GAINS WILL RESULT FROM ANTICIPATED IMPROVEMENTS IN THE

TRANSPORTATION AND POWER GENERATION SECTORS, DRIVEN BY THE INTRODUCTION OF NEW TECHNOLOGIES, AS WELL AS MANY OTHER IMPROVEMENTS THAT SPAN THE RESIDENTIAL, COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL SECTORS.

ENERGY FOR TRANSPORTATION  INCLUDING CARS, TRUCKS, SHIPS, TRAINS AND AIRPLANES  IS EXPECTED TO INCREASE BY NEARLY 45 PERCENT FROM

2010 TO 2040. THE GLOBAL GROWTH IN TRANSPORTATION DEMAND IS LIKELY TO ACCOUNT FOR APPROXIMATELY 75 PERCENT OF THE GROWTH IN LIQUIDS DEMAND OVER THIS PERIOD. NEARLY ALL THE WORLDS TRANSPORTATION FLEETS ARE LIKELY TO CONTINUE TO RUN ON LIQUID

FUELS BECAUSE THEY PROVIDE A LARGE QUANTITY OF ENERGY IN SMALL VOLUMES, MAKING THEM EASY TO TRANSPORT AND WIDELY AVAILABLE.

DEMAND

FOR ELECTRICITY AROUND THE WORLD IS ESTIMATED TO INCREASE APPROXIMATELY 80 PERCENT BY 2040, LED BY GROWTH IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES. CONSISTENT WITH THIS PROJECTION, POWER GENERATION WILL REMAIN THE LARGEST AND FASTEST-GROWING MAJOR SEGMENT OF GLOBAL

ENERGY DEMAND. MEETING THE EXPECTED GROWTH IN POWER DEMAND WILL REQUIRE A DIVERSE SET OF ENERGY SOURCES. NATURAL GAS DEMAND IS LIKELY TO GROW MOST SIGNIFICANTLY AND GAIN THE MOST MARKET SHARE. COAL IS LIKELY TO RETAIN THE LEADING SHARE OF POWER

GENERATION FUELS IN 2040, ALBEIT AT A MUCH LOWER SHARE THAN IN 2010 AS POLICIES ARE GRADUALLY ADOPTED TO REDUCE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS INCLUDING THOSE RELATED TO LOCAL AIR QUALITY AND GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS. NUCLEAR POWER AND RENEWABLES, LED BY

WIND, ARE LIKELY TO GROW SIGNIFICANTLY OVER THE PERIOD.

LIQUID FUELS PROVIDE THE LARGEST SHARE OF ENERGY SUPPLY TODAY DUE TO THEIR

BROAD-BASED AVAILABILITY, AFFORDABILITY AND EASE OF TRANSPORT TO MEET CONSUMER NEEDS. BY 2040, GLOBAL DEMAND FOR LIQUIDS IS EXPECTED TO GROW TO APPROXIMATELY 112 MILLION BARRELS OF OIL-EQUIVALENT PER DAY, AN INCREASE OF MORE THAN 25 PERCENT FROM

2010. GLOBAL DEMAND FOR LIQUID FUELS WILL BE MET BY A WIDE VARIETY OF SOURCES. CONVENTIONAL CRUDE AND CONDENSATE PRODUCTION IS EXPECTED TO REMAIN RELATIVELY FLAT THROUGH 2040. HOWEVER, GROWTH IS EXPECTED FROM A WIDE VARIETY OF SOURCES, INCLUDING

DEEP-WATER RESOURCES, OIL SANDS, TIGHT OIL, NATURAL GAS LIQUIDS, AND BIOFUELS. THE WORLDS RESOURCE BASE IS SUFFICIENT TO MEET PROJECTED DEMAND THROUGH 2040 AS TECHNOLOGY ADVANCES CONTINUE TO EXPAND THE AVAILABILITY OF ECONOMIC SUPPLY OPTIONS.

HOWEVER, ACCESS TO RESOURCES AND TIMELY INVESTMENTS WILL REMAIN CRITICAL TO MEETING GLOBAL NEEDS WITH RELIABLE, AFFORDABLE SUPPLIES.

NATURAL GAS IS A VERSATILE FUEL FOR A WIDE VARIETY OF APPLICATIONS, AND IS EXPECTED TO BE THE FASTEST GROWING MAJOR FUEL SOURCE THROUGH 2040.

GLOBAL DEMAND IS EXPECTED TO RISE 60 PERCENT BY 2040 COMPARED TO 2010, WITH DEMAND INCREASES IN MAJOR REGIONS AROUND THE WORLD REQUIRING NEW SOURCES OF SUPPLY. WE EXPECT THAT A SIGNIFICANT GROWTH IN SUPPLIES OF UNCONVENTIONAL GAS  THE

42

TABLE OF CONTENTS

INDEX TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NATURAL GAS FOUND IN SHALE AND OTHER ROCK FORMATIONS THAT WAS ONCE CONSIDERED UNECONOMIC TO PRODUCE  WILL HELP MEET THESE NEEDS. BY 2040, UNCONVENTIONAL GAS IS LIKELY TO ACCOUNT FOR ABOUT

30 PERCENT OF GLOBAL GAS SUPPLIES, UP FROM 10 PERCENT IN 2010. GROWING NATURAL GAS DEMAND IS LIKELY TO ALSO STIMULATE SIGNIFICANT GROWTH IN THE WORLDWIDE LIQUEFIED NATURAL GAS (LNG) MARKET, WHICH IS EXPECTED TO REACH 15 PERCENT OF GLOBAL GAS DEMAND

BY 2040.

THE WORLDS ENERGY MIX IS HIGHLY DIVERSE AND WILL REMAIN SO THROUGH 2040. OIL IS EXPECTED TO REMAIN THE LARGEST SOURCE

OF ENERGY WITH ITS SHARE REMAINING CLOSE TO ONE-THIRD IN 2040. COAL IS CURRENTLY THE SECOND LARGEST SOURCE OF ENERGY, BUT IT IS LIKELY TO LOSE THAT POSITION TO NATURAL GAS BY APPROXIMATELY 2025. THE SHARE OF NATURAL GAS IS EXPECTED TO EXCEED 25

PERCENT BY 2040, WHILE THE SHARE OF COAL FALLS TO LESS THAN 20 PERCENT. NUCLEAR POWER IS PROJECTED TO GROW SIGNIFICANTLY, ALBEIT AT A SLOWER PACE THAN OTHERWISE EXPECTED IN THE AFTERMATH OF THE FUKUSHIMA INCIDENT IN JAPAN FOLLOWING THE EARTHQUAKE

AND TSUNAMI IN MARCH 2011. TOTAL RENEWABLE ENERGY IS LIKELY TO REACH CLOSE TO 15 PERCENT OF TOTAL ENERGY BY 2040, INCLUDING BIOMASS, HYDRO AND GEOTHERMAL AT A COMBINED SHARE OF ABOUT 11 PERCENT. TOTAL ENERGY SUPPLIED FROM WIND, SOLAR AND BIOFUELS IS

EXPECTED TO INCREASE CLOSE TO 500 PERCENT FROM 2010 TO 2040, REACHING A COMBINED SHARE OF APPROXIMATELY 4 PERCENT OF WORLD ENERGY.

THE CORPORATION ANTICIPATES THAT THE WORLDS AVAILABLE OIL AND GAS RESOURCE BASE WILL GROW NOT ONLY FROM NEW DISCOVERIES, BUT ALSO FROM

RESERVE INCREASES IN PREVIOUSLY DISCOVERED FIELDS. TECHNOLOGY WILL UNDERPIN THESE INCREASES. THE COST TO DEVELOP AND SUPPLY THESE RESOURCES WILL BE SIGNIFICANT. ACCORDING TO THE INTERNATIONAL ENERGY AGENCY, THE INVESTMENT REQUIRED TO MEET TOTAL OIL

AND GAS ENERGY NEEDS WORLDWIDE OVER THE PERIOD 2011-2035 WILL BE CLOSE TO $20 TRILLION (MEASURED IN 2010 DOLLARS) OR CLOSE TO $780 BILLION PER YEAR ON AVERAGE.

INTERNATIONAL ACCORDS AND UNDERLYING REGIONAL AND NATIONAL REGULATIONS FOR GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION ARE EVOLVING WITH UNCERTAIN TIMING AND OUTCOME, MAKING IT DIFFICULT TO PREDICT THEIR BUSINESS IMPACT.

EXXONMOBIL INCLUDES ESTIMATES OF POTENTIAL COSTS RELATED TO POSSIBLE PUBLIC POLICIES COVERING ENERGY-RELATED GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS IN ITS LONG-TERM ENERGY OUTLOOK, WHICH IS USED FOR ASSESSING THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT AND IN ITS INVESTMENT

EVALUATIONS.

THE INFORMATION PROVIDED IN THE LONG-TERM BUSINESS OUTLOOK INCLUDES EXXONMOBILS INTERNAL ESTIMATES AND FORECASTS

BASED UPON INTERNAL DATA AND ANALYSES AS WELL AS PUBLICLY AVAILABLE INFORMATION FROM EXTERNAL SOURCES INCLUDING THE INTERNATIONAL ENERGY AGENCY.

UPSTREAM

EXXONMOBIL CONTINUES TO MAINTAIN A DIVERSE

PORTFOLIO OF EXPLORATION AND DEVELOPMENT OPPORTUNITIES, WHICH ENABLES THE CORPORATION TO BE SELECTIVE, MAXIMIZING SHAREHOLDER VALUE AND MITIGATING POLITICAL AND TECHNICAL RISKS. EXXONMOBILS FUNDAMENTAL UPSTREAM BUSINESS STRATEGIES GUIDE OUR

GLOBAL EXPLORATION, DEVELOPMENT, PRODUCTION, AND GAS AND POWER MARKETING ACTIVITIES. THESE STRATEGIES INCLUDE IDENTIFYING AND SELECTIVELY CAPTURING THE HIGHEST QUALITY EXPLORATION OPPORTUNITIES, MAXIMIZING THE PROFITABILITY OF EXISTING OIL AND GAS

PRODUCTION, INVESTING IN PROJECTS THAT DELIVER SUPERIOR RETURNS, CAPITALIZING ON GROWING NATURAL GAS AND POWER MARKETS, AND MAXIMIZING RESOURCE VALUE THROUGH HIGH-IMPACT TECHNOLOGIES. THESE STRATEGIES ARE UNDERPINNED BY A RELENTLESS FOCUS ON

OPERATIONAL EXCELLENCE, COMMITMENT TO INNOVATIVE TECHNOLOGIES, DEVELOPMENT OF OUR EMPLOYEES, AND INVESTMENT IN THE COMMUNITIES WITHIN WHICH WE OPERATE.

AS FUTURE DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS AND DRILLING ACTIVITIES BRING NEW PRODUCTION ONLINE, THE CORPORATION EXPECTS A SHIFT IN THE GEOGRAPHIC MIX OF ITS PRODUCTION VOLUMES BETWEEN NOW AND 2016. OIL AND NATURAL GAS

OUTPUT FROM NORTH AMERICA IS EXPECTED TO INCREASE OVER THE NEXT FIVE YEARS BASED ON CURRENT CAPITAL ACTIVITY PLANS. CURRENTLY, THIS GROWTH AREA ACCOUNTS FOR 30 PERCENT OF THE CORPORATIONS PRODUCTION. BY 2016, IT IS EXPECTED TO GENERATE ABOUT

35 PERCENT OF TOTAL VOLUMES. THE REMAINDER OF THE CORPORATIONS PRODUCTION IS EXPECTED TO INCLUDE CONTRIBUTIONS FROM BOTH ESTABLISHED OPERATIONS AND NEW PROJECTS AROUND THE GLOBE.

IN ADDITION TO AN EVOLVING GEOGRAPHIC MIX, WE EXPECT THERE WILL ALSO BE CONTINUED CHANGE IN THE TYPE OF OPPORTUNITIES FROM WHICH VOLUMES ARE

PRODUCED. PRODUCTION FROM DIVERSE RESOURCE TYPES UTILIZING SPECIALIZED TECHNOLOGIES SUCH AS ARCTIC TECHNOLOGY, DEEPWATER DRILLING AND PRODUCTION SYSTEMS, HEAVY OIL AND OIL SANDS RECOVERY PROCESSES, UNCONVENTIONAL GAS AND OIL PRODUCTION AND LNG IS

EXPECTED TO GROW FROM ABOUT 45 PERCENT TO AROUND 50 PERCENT OF THE CORPORATIONS OUTPUT BETWEEN NOW AND 2016. WE DO NOT ANTICIPATE THAT THE EXPECTED CHANGE IN THE GEOGRAPHIC MIX OF PRODUCTION VOLUMES, AND IN THE TYPES OF OPPORTUNITIES FROM

WHICH VOLUMES WILL BE PRODUCED, WILL HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE NATURE AND THE EXTENT OF THE RISKS DISCLOSED IN ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS, OR RESULT IN A MATERIAL CHANGE IN OUR LEVEL OF UNIT OPERATING EXPENSES. THE CORPORATIONS OVERALL VOLUME

CAPACITY OUTLOOK, BASED ON PROJECTS COMING ONSTREAM AS ANTICIPATED, IS FOR PRODUCTION CAPACITY TO GROW OVER THE PERIOD 2012-2016. HOWEVER, ACTUAL VOLUMES WILL VARY FROM YEAR TO YEAR DUE TO THE TIMING OF INDIVIDUAL PROJECT START-UPS AND OTHER CAPITAL

ACTIVITIES, OPERATIONAL OUTAGES, RESERVOIR PERFORMANCE, PERFORMANCE OF ENHANCED OIL RECOVERY PROJECTS, REGULATORY CHANGES, ASSET SALES, WEATHER EVENTS, PRICE EFFECTS UNDER PRODUCTION SHARING CONTRACTS AND OTHER FACTORS DESCRIBED IN ITEM 1A.

RISK FACTORS. ENHANCED OIL RECOVERY PROJECTS EXTRACT HYDROCARBONS FROM RESERVOIRS IN EXCESS OF THAT WHICH MAY BE PRODUCED THROUGH PRIMARY RECOVERY, I.E., THROUGH PRESSURE DEPLETION OR NATURAL AQUIFER SUPPORT. THEY INCLUDE THE INJECTION OF WATER,

GASES OR CHEMICALS INTO A RESERVOIR TO PRODUCE HYDROCARBONS OTHERWISE UNOBTAINABLE.

DOWNSTREAM

EXXONMOBILS DOWNSTREAM IS A LARGE, DIVERSIFIED BUSINESS WITH REFINING AND MARKETING COMPLEXES AROUND THE WORLD. THE CORPORATION HAS A STRONG PRESENCE IN

MATURE MARKETS IN NORTH AMERICA AND EUROPE, AS WELL AS THE GROWING ASIA PACIFIC REGION. EXXONMOBILS FUNDAMENTAL DOWNSTREAM BUSINESS STRATEGIES POSITION THE COMPANY TO DELIVER LONG-TERM GROWTH IN SHAREHOLDER VALUE THAT IS SUPERIOR TO

COMPETITION ACROSS A RANGE OF MARKET CONDITIONS. THESE STRATEGIES INCLUDE MAINTAINING BEST-IN-CLASS OPERATIONS IN ALL ASPECTS OF THE BUSINESS, MAXIMIZING VALUE FROM LEADING-EDGE TECHNOLOGIES, CAPITALIZING ON INTEGRATION ACROSS EXXONMOBIL BUSINESSES,

SELECTIVELY INVESTING FOR RESILIENT, ADVANTAGED RETURNS, LEADING THE INDUSTRY IN EFFICIENCY AND EFFECTIVENESS, AND PROVIDING QUALITY, VALUED PRODUCTS AND SERVICES TO CUSTOMERS.

INDEX TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

EXXONMOBIL HAS AN OWNERSHIP INTEREST IN 36 REFINERIES, LOCATED IN 21 COUNTRIES, WITH

DISTILLATION CAPACITY OF 6.2 MILLION BARRELS PER DAY AND LUBRICANT BASESTOCK MANUFACTURING CAPACITY OF 131 THOUSAND BARRELS PER DAY. EXXONMOBILS FUELS AND LUBES MARKETING BUSINESS PORTFOLIOS INCLUDE OPERATIONS AROUND THE WORLD, WITH MULTIPLE

CHANNELS TO MARKET SERVING A GLOBALLY DIVERSE CUSTOMER BASE. OUR WORLD-CLASS BRANDS, INCLUDING

EXXON

,

MOBIL

AND

ESSO

, ARE WELL-KNOWN.

THE DOWNSTREAM INDUSTRY ENVIRONMENT REMAINS CHALLENGING. ALTHOUGH DEMAND FOR REFINED PRODUCTS HAS IMPROVED FROM THE LOWER LEVELS IN 2009 DUE TO THE GLOBAL ECONOMIC RECESSION, WE EXPECT THE CHALLENGING BUSINESS

ENVIRONMENT TO CONTINUE, REFLECTING THE INCREASE IN GLOBAL REFINING CAPACITY AND REGULATORY RELATED POLICIES. OVER THE PRIOR 20-YEAR PERIOD, INFLATION-ADJUSTED REFINING MARGINS HAVE BEEN FLAT.

REFINING MARGINS ARE LARGELY DRIVEN BY DIFFERENCES IN COMMODITY PRICES AND ARE A FUNCTION OF THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WHAT A REFINERY PAYS FOR ITS

RAW MATERIALS (PRIMARILY CRUDE OIL) AND THE MARKET PRICES FOR THE RANGE OF PRODUCTS PRODUCED (PRIMARILY GASOLINE, HEATING OIL, DIESEL OIL, JET FUEL AND FUEL OIL). CRUDE OIL AND MANY PRODUCTS ARE WIDELY TRADED WITH PUBLISHED PRICES, INCLUDING THOSE

QUOTED ON MULTIPLE EXCHANGES AROUND THE WORLD (E.G., NEW YORK MERCANTILE EXCHANGE AND INTERCONTINENTAL EXCHANGE). PRICES FOR THESE COMMODITIES ARE DETERMINED BY THE GLOBAL MARKETPLACE AND ARE INFLUENCED BY MANY FACTORS, INCLUDING GLOBAL AND REGIONAL

SUPPLY/DEMAND BALANCES, INVENTORY LEVELS, REFINERY OPERATIONS, IMPORT/EXPORT BALANCES, CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS, SEASONAL DEMAND, WEATHER AND POLITICAL CLIMATE.

EXXONMOBILS LONG-TERM OUTLOOK IS THAT REFINING MARGINS WILL REMAIN WEAK AS COMPETITION IN THE INDUSTRY REMAINS INTENSE AND, IN THE NEAR TERM, NEW CAPACITY ADDITIONS OUTPACE THE GROWTH IN GLOBAL DEMAND.

ADDITIONALLY, AS DESCRIBED IN MORE DETAIL IN ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS, PROPOSED CARBON POLICY AND OTHER CLIMATE-RELATED REGULATIONS IN MANY COUNTRIES, AS WELL AS THE CONTINUED GROWTH IN BIOFUELS MANDATES, COULD HAVE NEGATIVE IMPACTS ON THE REFINING

BUSINESS.

IN THE RETAIL FUELS MARKETING BUSINESS, COMPETITION CONTINUES TO CAUSE INFLATION-ADJUSTED MARGINS TO DECLINE. IN 2011,

EXXONMOBIL PROGRESSED THE TRANSITION OF THE DIRECT SERVED (I.E., DEALER, COMPANY-OPERATED) RETAIL NETWORK IN THE U.S. TO A MORE CAPITAL-EFFICIENT BRANDED DISTRIBUTOR MODEL. THIS TRANSITION WAS ANNOUNCED IN 2008 AND IS EXPECTED TO BE COMPLETE IN

2012.

OUR LUBRICANTS AND SPECIALTIES BUSINESS CONTINUES TO GROW. EXXONMOBIL IS A MARKET LEADER IN HIGH-VALUE SYNTHETIC LUBRICANTS,

AND WE CONTINUE TO GROW OUR BUSINESS IN KEY MARKETS SUCH AS CHINA, INDIA AND RUSSIA AT RATES CONSIDERABLY FASTER THAN INDUSTRY.

DOWNSTREAM PORTFOLIO IS CONTINUALLY EVALUATED DURING ALL PARTS OF THE BUSINESS CYCLE, AND NUMEROUS ASSET DIVESTMENTS HAVE BEEN MADE OVER THE PAST DECADE. IN 2011, WE ANNOUNCED DIVESTMENTS OF OUR DOWNSTREAM BUSINESSES IN ARGENTINA, URUGUAY, PARAGUAY,

CENTRAL AMERICA, MALAYSIA, AND SWITZERLAND. IN JANUARY 2012, WE ALSO ANNOUNCED THE RESTRUCTURING OF OUR HOLDINGS IN JAPAN WHICH IS DISCLOSED IN NOTE 20. WHEN INVESTING IN THE DOWNSTREAM, EXXONMOBIL REMAINS FOCUSED ON SELECTIVE AND RESILIENT

PROJECTS. THESE INVESTMENTS CAPITALIZE ON THE CORPORATIONS WORLD-CLASS SCALE AND INTEGRATION, INDUSTRY LEADING EFFICIENCY, LEADING-EDGE TECHNOLOGY AND RESPECTED BRANDS, ENABLING EXXONMOBIL TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF ATTRACTIVE EMERGING GROWTH

OPPORTUNITIES AROUND THE GLOBE. IN 2011, THE COMPANY COMPLETED CONSTRUCTION OF NEW UNITS AND MODIFICATION OF EXISTING FACILITIES AT THE SRIRACHA, THAILAND, REFINERY TO PRODUCE LOWER SULFUR DIESEL AND GASOLINE TO MEET UPCOMING PRODUCT SPECIFICATIONS

IN THAILAND. AT THE JURONG/PAC REFINERY IN SINGAPORE, PLANS ARE UNDER WAY TO BUILD A NEW DIESEL HYDROTREATER, WHICH WILL ADD CAPACITY OF MORE THAN 2 MILLION GALLONS PER DAY TO MEET INCREASING DEMAND IN THE ASIA PACIFIC REGION. ADDITIONALLY,

CONSTRUCTION OF A LOWER SULFUR FUELS PROJECT HAS BEGUN AT THE JOINT SAUDI ARAMCO AND EXXONMOBIL SAMREF REFINERY IN YANBU, SAUDI ARABIA. THE PROJECT WILL INCLUDE NEW GASOLINE AND EXPANDED DIESEL HYDROTREATING AND SULFUR RECOVERY EQUIPMENT, AND

COMPLETION IS EXPECTED BY THE END OF 2013. WE ARE ALSO EXPANDING OUR SINGAPORE AND CHINA LUBE OIL BLENDING PLANTS TO SUPPORT FUTURE DEMAND GROWTH IN THESE EMERGING MARKETS.

CHEMICAL

WORLDWIDE PETROCHEMICAL DEMAND GREW MODESTLY IN 2011. IN NORTH AMERICA, UNCONVENTIONAL NATURAL GAS

CONTINUED TO PROVIDE ADVANTAGED ETHANE FEEDSTOCK FOR STEAM CRACKERS AND A FAVORABLE MARGIN ENVIRONMENT FOR INTEGRATED CHEMICAL PRODUCERS. MARGINS IN ASIA PACIFIC REMAINED LOW, WITH NEW SUPPLY CAPACITY OUTPACING DEMAND. SPECIALTY PRODUCTS OVERALL SAW

FIRM GLOBAL DEMAND AND MARGINS.

EXXONMOBIL BENEFITED FROM CONTINUED OPERATIONAL EXCELLENCE AND A BALANCED PORTFOLIO OF PRODUCTS. IN

ADDITION TO BEING A WORLDWIDE SUPPLIER OF COMMODITY PETROCHEMICAL PRODUCTS, EXXONMOBIL CHEMICAL ALSO HAS A NUMBER OF LESS-CYCLICAL SPECIALTIES BUSINESS LINES, WHICH DELIVERED STRONG RESULTS IN 2011. CHEMICALS COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGES ARE DUE TO

ITS BUSINESS MIX, BROAD GEOGRAPHIC COVERAGE, INVESTMENT AND COST DISCIPLINE, INTEGRATION WITH REFINERIES OR UPSTREAM GAS PROCESSING FACILITIES, SUPERIOR FEEDSTOCK MANAGEMENT, LEADING PROPRIETARY TECHNOLOGY AND PRODUCT APPLICATION EXPERTISE.

PROCEEDS ASSOCIATED WITH ASSET SALES, INCLUDING A $3.6 BILLION DEPOSIT FOR A POTENTIAL ASSET SALE, AND A NET DEBT INCREASE IN CONTRAST WITH PRIOR YEAR DEBT REPURCHASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A HIGHER LEVEL OF PURCHASES OF EXXONMOBIL SHARES AND A

HIGHER LEVEL OF CAPITAL SPENDING. INCLUDED IN TOTAL CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS AT YEAR-END 2011 WAS $0.4 BILLION OF RESTRICTED CASH.

TOTAL CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS WERE $8.5 BILLION AT THE END OF 2010, $2.2 BILLION LOWER THAN THE PRIOR YEAR. HIGHER EARNINGS AND REDUCED SHARE

PURCHASES WERE OFFSET BY A HIGHER LEVEL OF CAPITAL SPENDING AND INCREASED LEVEL OF DEBT REPURCHASES. INCLUDED IN TOTAL CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS AT YEAR-END 2010 WAS $0.6 BILLION OF RESTRICTED CASH. FOR ADDITIONAL DETAILS, SEE THE CONSOLIDATED

STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS.

ALTHOUGH THE CORPORATION HAS ACCESS TO SIGNIFICANT CAPACITY OF LONG-TERM AND SHORT-TERM LIQUIDITY,

INTERNALLY GENERATED FUNDS COVER THE MAJORITY OF ITS FINANCIAL REQUIREMENTS. CASH THAT MAY BE TEMPORARILY AVAILABLE AS SURPLUS TO THE CORPORATIONS IMMEDIATE NEEDS IS CAREFULLY MANAGED THROUGH COUNTERPARTY QUALITY AND INVESTMENT GUIDELINES TO

ENSURE IT IS SECURE AND READILY AVAILABLE TO MEET THE CORPORATIONS CASH REQUIREMENTS AND TO OPTIMIZE RETURNS.

TO SUPPORT CASH

FLOWS IN FUTURE PERIODS THE CORPORATION WILL NEED TO CONTINUALLY FIND AND DEVELOP NEW FIELDS, AND CONTINUE TO DEVELOP AND APPLY NEW TECHNOLOGIES AND RECOVERY PROCESSES TO EXISTING FIELDS, IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN OR INCREASE PRODUCTION. AFTER A PERIOD

OF PRODUCTION AT PLATEAU RATES, IT IS THE NATURE OF OIL AND GAS FIELDS EVENTUALLY TO PRODUCE AT DECLINING RATES FOR THE REMAINDER OF THEIR ECONOMIC LIFE. AVERAGED OVER ALL THE CORPORATIONS EXISTING OIL AND GAS FIELDS AND WITHOUT NEW PROJECTS,

EXXONMOBILS PRODUCTION IS EXPECTED TO DECLINE AT AN AVERAGE OF APPROXIMATELY 3 PERCENT PER YEAR OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS. DECLINE RATES CAN VARY WIDELY BY INDIVIDUAL FIELD DUE TO A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE TYPE OF

RESERVOIR, FLUID PROPERTIES, RECOVERY MECHANISMS, WORK ACTIVITY, AND AGE OF THE FIELD. FURTHERMORE, THE CORPORATIONS NET INTEREST IN PRODUCTION FOR INDIVIDUAL FIELDS CAN VARY WITH PRICE AND CONTRACTUAL TERMS.

THE CORPORATION HAS LONG BEEN SUCCESSFUL AT OFFSETTING THE EFFECTS OF NATURAL FIELD DECLINE THROUGH DISCIPLINED INVESTMENTS IN QUALITY

OPPORTUNITIES AND PROJECT EXECUTION. OVER THE LAST DECADE, THIS HAS RESULTED IN NET ANNUAL ADDITIONS TO PROVED RESERVES THAT HAVE EXCEEDED THE AMOUNT PRODUCED. PROJECTS ARE IN PROGRESS OR PLANNED TO INCREASE PRODUCTION CAPACITY. HOWEVER, THESE

VOLUME INCREASES ARE SUBJECT TO A VARIETY OF RISKS INCLUDING PROJECT START-UP TIMING, OPERATIONAL OUTAGES, RESERVOIR PERFORMANCE, CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS PRICES, WEATHER EVENTS, AND REGULATORY CHANGES. THE CORPORATIONS CASH FLOWS ARE ALSO

HIGHLY DEPENDENT ON CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS PRICES. PLEASE REFER TO ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS FOR A MORE COMPLETE DISCUSSION OF RISKS.

THE CORPORATIONS FINANCIAL STRENGTH ENABLES IT TO MAKE LARGE, LONG-TERM CAPITAL EXPENDITURES. CAPITAL AND EXPLORATION EXPENDITURES IN 2011 WERE $36.8 BILLION, REFLECTING THE CORPORATIONS CONTINUED

ACTIVE INVESTMENT PROGRAM. THE CORPORATION ANTICIPATES AN INVESTMENT PROFILE OF ABOUT $37 BILLION PER YEAR FOR THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS. ACTUAL SPENDING COULD VARY DEPENDING ON THE PROGRESS OF INDIVIDUAL PROJECTS. THE CORPORATION HAS A LARGE AND

DIVERSE PORTFOLIO OF DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS AND EXPLORATION OPPORTUNITIES, WHICH HELPS MITIGATE THE OVERALL POLITICAL AND TECHNICAL RISKS OF THE CORPORATIONS UPSTREAM SEGMENT AND ASSOCIATED CASH FLOW. FURTHER, DUE TO ITS FINANCIAL STRENGTH, DEBT

CAPACITY AND DIVERSE PORTFOLIO OF OPPORTUNITIES, THE RISK ASSOCIATED WITH FAILURE OR DELAY OF ANY SINGLE PROJECT WOULD NOT HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE CORPORATIONS LIQUIDITY OR ABILITY TO GENERATE SUFFICIENT CASH FLOWS FOR OPERATIONS AND

ITS FIXED COMMITMENTS. THE PURCHASE AND SALE OF OIL AND GAS PROPERTIES HAVE NOT HAD A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE AMOUNT OR TIMING OF CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES.

CASH FLOW FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES

2011

CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES TOTALED $55.3 BILLION IN 2011, $6.9 BILLION HIGHER THAN 2010. THE MAJOR SOURCE OF FUNDS WAS NET INCOME INCLUDING NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS OF $42.2 BILLION, ADJUSTED FOR THE

NONCASH PROVISION OF $15.6 BILLION FOR DEPRECIATION AND DEPLETION, BOTH OF WHICH INCREASED. CHANGES IN OPERATIONAL WORKING CAPITAL, EXCLUDING CASH AND DEBT, AND THE ADJUSTMENT FOR NET GAINS ON ASSET SALES DECREASED CASH IN 2011. NET WORKING CAPITAL

CONTINUED TO BE NEGATIVE AS TOTAL CURRENT LIABILITIES OF $77.5 BILLION EXCEEDED TOTAL CURRENT ASSETS OF $73.0 BILLION AT YEAR-END 2011.

2010

CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES TOTALED $48.4 BILLION IN 2010, $20.0 BILLION HIGHER THAN 2009. THE MAJOR SOURCE OF FUNDS WAS NET

CASH FLOW FROM FINANCING ACTIVITIES

2011

CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES WAS $28.3 BILLION

IN 2011, $1.3 BILLION HIGHER THAN 2010. DIVIDEND PAYMENTS ON COMMON SHARES INCREASED TO $1.85 PER SHARE FROM $1.74 PER SHARE AND TOTALED $9.0 BILLION, A PAY-OUT OF 22 PERCENT. TOTAL DEBT INCREASED $2.0 BILLION TO $17.0 BILLION AT YEAR-END.

EXXONMOBIL SHARE OF EQUITY INCREASED $7.6 BILLION TO $154.4 BILLION. THE ADDITION TO EQUITY FOR EARNINGS OF $41.1 BILLION WAS

PARTIALLY OFFSET BY REDUCTIONS FOR DISTRIBUTIONS TO EXXONMOBIL SHAREHOLDERS OF $9.0 BILLION OF DIVIDENDS AND $20.0 BILLION OF PURCHASES OF SHARES OF EXXONMOBIL STOCK TO REDUCE SHARES OUTSTANDING. THE CHANGE IN THE FUNDED STATUS OF THE POSTRETIREMENT

BENEFITS RESERVES IN 2011 DECREASED EQUITY BY $4.6 BILLION.

DURING 2011, EXXON MOBIL CORPORATION PURCHASED 278 MILLION SHARES OF ITS

COMMON STOCK FOR THE TREASURY AT A GROSS COST OF $22.1 BILLION. THESE PURCHASES WERE TO REDUCE THE NUMBER OF SHARES OUTSTANDING AND TO OFFSET SHARES ISSUED IN CONJUNCTION WITH COMPANY BENEFIT PLANS AND PROGRAMS. SHARES OUTSTANDING WERE REDUCED BY

4.9 PERCENT FROM 4,979 MILLION TO 4,734 MILLION AT THE END OF 2011. PURCHASES WERE MADE IN BOTH THE OPEN MARKET AND THROUGH NEGOTIATED TRANSACTIONS. PURCHASES MAY BE INCREASED, DECREASED OR DISCONTINUED AT ANY TIME WITHOUT PRIOR NOTICE.

CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES WAS $26.9 BILLION

IN 2010, $0.4 BILLION LOWER THAN 2009. DIVIDEND PAYMENTS ON COMMON SHARES INCREASED TO $1.74 PER SHARE FROM $1.66 PER SHARE AND TOTALED $8.5 BILLION, A PAY-OUT OF 28 PERCENT. TOTAL DEBT INCREASED TO $15.0 BILLION AT YEAR END, AN INCREASE OF $5.4

BILLION FROM 2009, PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF DEBT ASSUMED WITH THE XTO MERGER.

EXXONMOBIL SHARE OF EQUITY INCREASED $36.3 BILLION TO

$146.8 BILLION. THE ADDITION TO EQUITY FOR EARNINGS OF $30.5 BILLION AND THE ISSUANCE OF STOCK FOR THE XTO MERGER OF $24.7 BILLION WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY REDUCTIONS TO EQUITY FOR DISTRIBUTIONS TO EXXONMOBIL SHAREHOLDERS OF $8.5 BILLION OF DIVIDENDS

AND $11.2 BILLION OF PURCHASES OF SHARES OF EXXONMOBIL STOCK TO REDUCE SHARES OUTSTANDING.

DURING 2010, EXXON MOBIL CORPORATION

ISSUED 416 MILLION SHARES FOR THE XTO MERGER. EXXON MOBIL CORPORATION PURCHASED 199 MILLION SHARES OF ITS COMMON STOCK FOR THE TREASURY AT A GROSS COST OF $13.1 BILLION. THESE PURCHASES WERE TO REDUCE THE NUMBER OF SHARES OUTSTANDING

AND TO OFFSET SHARES ISSUED IN CONJUNCTION WITH COMPANY BENEFIT PLANS AND PROGRAMS. SHARES OUTSTANDING INCREASED BY 5.3 PERCENT FROM 4,727 MILLION AT THE END OF 2009 TO 4,979 MILLION AT THE END OF 2010. PURCHASES WERE MADE IN BOTH THE OPEN

MARKET AND THROUGH NEGOTIATED TRANSACTIONS.

CAPITAL

AND EXPLORATION EXPENDITURES IN 2011 WERE $36.8 BILLION, REFLECTING THE CORPORATIONS CONTINUED ACTIVE INVESTMENT PROGRAM. THE CORPORATION ANTICIPATES AN INVESTMENT PROFILE OF ABOUT $37 BILLION PER YEAR FOR THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS. ACTUAL

SPENDING COULD VARY DEPENDING ON THE PROGRESS OF INDIVIDUAL PROJECTS.

UPSTREAM SPENDING OF $33.1 BILLION IN 2011 WAS UP 21 PERCENT

FROM 2010, REFLECTING UNCONVENTIONAL GAS ACTIVITIES IN THE U.S. AND CONTINUED PROGRESS ON WORLD-CLASS PROJECTS IN AUSTRALIA, CANADA AND PAPUA NEW GUINEA. THE MAJORITY OF EXPENDITURES ARE ON DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS, WHICH TYPICALLY TAKE TWO TO FOUR

YEARS FROM THE TIME OF RECORDING PROVED UNDEVELOPED RESERVES TO THE START OF PRODUCTION FROM THOSE RESERVES. THE PERCENTAGE OF PROVED DEVELOPED RESERVES WAS 65 PERCENT OF TOTAL PROVED RESERVES AT YEAR-END 2011, AND HAS BEEN OVER 60 PERCENT FOR THE

LAST FIVE YEARS, INDICATING THAT PROVED RESERVES ARE CONSISTENTLY MOVED FROM UNDEVELOPED TO DEVELOPED STATUS. CAPITAL INVESTMENTS IN THE DOWNSTREAM TOTALED $2.1 BILLION IN 2011, A DECREASE OF $0.4 BILLION FROM 2010, DUE TO COMPLETION OF

ENVIRONMENTAL-RELATED REFINING PROJECTS, PRIMARILY IN THE U.S. THE CHEMICAL CAPITAL EXPENDITURES OF $1.5 BILLION WERE $0.8 BILLION LOWER IN 2011 AS INVESTMENTS IN ASIA TO MEET DEMAND GROWTH PROGRESSED TOWARD COMPLETION.

THROUGHOUT EXXONMOBILS BUSINESSES, NEW AND ONGOING MEASURES ARE TAKEN TO PREVENT AND MINIMIZE THE IMPACT OF OUR

OPERATIONS ON AIR, WATER AND GROUND. THESE INCLUDE A SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT IN REFINING INFRASTRUCTURE AND TECHNOLOGY TO MANUFACTURE CLEAN FUELS AS WELL AS PROJECTS TO MONITOR AND REDUCE NITROGEN OXIDE, SULFUR OXIDE AND GREENHOUSE GAS

EMISSIONS AND EXPENDITURES FOR ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS. EXXONMOBILS 2011 WORLDWIDE ENVIRONMENTAL EXPENDITURES FOR ALL SUCH PREVENTATIVE AND REMEDIATION STEPS, INCLUDING EXXONMOBILS SHARE OF EQUITY COMPANY EXPENDITURES, WERE ABOUT

$4.9 BILLION. THE TOTAL COST FOR SUCH ACTIVITIES IS EXPECTED TO REMAIN IN THIS RANGE IN 2012 AND 2013 (WITH CAPITAL EXPENDITURES APPROXIMATELY 45 PERCENT OF THE TOTAL).

ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES

THE CORPORATION ACCRUES ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES WHEN IT IS PROBABLE THAT

OBLIGATIONS HAVE BEEN INCURRED AND THE AMOUNTS CAN BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED. THIS POLICY APPLIES TO ASSETS OR BUSINESSES CURRENTLY OWNED OR PREVIOUSLY DISPOSED. EXXONMOBIL HAS ACCRUED LIABILITIES FOR PROBABLE ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION OBLIGATIONS AT

VARIOUS SITES, INCLUDING MULTIPARTY SITES WHERE THE U.S. ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY HAS IDENTIFIED EXXONMOBIL AS ONE OF THE POTENTIALLY RESPONSIBLE PARTIES. THE INVOLVEMENT OF OTHER FINANCIALLY RESPONSIBLE COMPANIES AT THESE MULTIPARTY SITES

COULD MITIGATE EXXONMOBILS ACTUAL JOINT AND SEVERAL LIABILITY EXPOSURE. AT PRESENT, NO INDIVIDUAL SITE IS EXPECTED TO HAVE LOSSES MATERIAL TO EXXONMOBILS OPERATIONS OR FINANCIAL CONDITION. CONSOLIDATED COMPANY PROVISIONS MADE IN 2011 FOR

ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES WERE $420 MILLION ($448 MILLION IN 2010) AND THE BALANCE SHEET REFLECTS ACCUMULATED LIABILITIES OF $886 MILLION AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2011, AND $948 MILLION AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2010.

CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES.

CRUDE OIL, NATURAL GAS,

PETROLEUM PRODUCT AND CHEMICAL PRICES HAVE FLUCTUATED IN RESPONSE TO CHANGING MARKET FORCES. THE IMPACTS OF THESE PRICE FLUCTUATIONS ON EARNINGS FROM UPSTREAM, DOWNSTREAM AND CHEMICAL OPERATIONS HAVE VARIED. IN THE UPSTREAM, A $1 PER BARREL CHANGE

IN THE WEIGHTED-AVERAGE REALIZED PRICE OF OIL WOULD HAVE APPROXIMATELY A $350 MILLION ANNUAL AFTER-TAX EFFECT ON UPSTREAM CONSOLIDATED PLUS EQUITY COMPANY EARNINGS. SIMILARLY, A $0.10 PER KCF CHANGE IN THE WORLDWIDE AVERAGE GAS REALIZATION WOULD

HAVE APPROXIMATELY A $200 MILLION ANNUAL AFTER-TAX EFFECT ON UPSTREAM CONSOLIDATED PLUS EQUITY COMPANY EARNINGS. FOR ANY GIVEN PERIOD, THE EXTENT OF ACTUAL BENEFIT OR DETRIMENT WILL BE DEPENDENT ON THE PRICE MOVEMENTS OF INDIVIDUAL TYPES OF CRUDE

OIL, TAXES AND OTHER GOVERNMENT TAKE IMPACTS, PRICE ADJUSTMENT LAGS IN LONG-TERM GAS CONTRACTS, AND CRUDE AND GAS PRODUCTION VOLUMES. ACCORDINGLY, CHANGES IN BENCHMARK PRICES FOR CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS ONLY PROVIDE BROAD INDICATORS OF CHANGES IN

THE EARNINGS EXPERIENCED IN ANY PARTICULAR PERIOD.

IN THE VERY COMPETITIVE DOWNSTREAM AND CHEMICAL ENVIRONMENTS, EARNINGS ARE

PRIMARILY DETERMINED BY MARGIN CAPTURE RATHER THAN ABSOLUTE PRICE LEVELS OF PRODUCTS SOLD. REFINING MARGINS ARE A FUNCTION OF THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WHAT A REFINER PAYS FOR ITS RAW MATERIALS (PRIMARILY CRUDE OIL) AND THE MARKET PRICES FOR THE RANGE

OF PRODUCTS PRODUCED. THESE PRICES IN TURN DEPEND ON GLOBAL AND REGIONAL SUPPLY/DEMAND BALANCES, INVENTORY LEVELS, REFINERY OPERATIONS, IMPORT/EXPORT BALANCES AND WEATHER.

THE GLOBAL ENERGY MARKETS CAN GIVE RISE TO EXTENDED PERIODS IN WHICH MARKET CONDITIONS ARE ADVERSE TO ONE OR MORE OF THE CORPORATIONS BUSINESSES. SUCH CONDITIONS, ALONG WITH THE CAPITAL-INTENSIVE NATURE OF

THE INDUSTRY AND VERY LONG LEAD TIMES ASSOCIATED WITH MANY OF OUR PROJECTS, UNDERSCORE THE IMPORTANCE OF MAINTAINING A STRONG FINANCIAL POSITION. MANAGEMENT VIEWS THE CORPORATIONS FINANCIAL STRENGTH AS A COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE.

IN GENERAL, SEGMENT RESULTS ARE NOT DEPENDENT ON THE ABILITY TO SELL AND/OR PURCHASE PRODUCTS TO/FROM OTHER SEGMENTS. INSTEAD, WHERE SUCH SALES

TAKE PLACE, THEY ARE THE RESULT OF EFFICIENCIES AND COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGES OF INTEGRATED REFINERY/CHEMICAL COMPLEXES. ADDITIONALLY, INTERSEGMENT SALES ARE AT MARKET-BASED PRICES. THE PRODUCTS BOUGHT AND SOLD BETWEEN SEGMENTS CAN ALSO BE ACQUIRED IN

WORLDWIDE MARKETS THAT HAVE SUBSTANTIAL LIQUIDITY, CAPACITY AND TRANSPORTATION CAPABILITIES. ABOUT 35 PERCENT OF THE CORPORATIONS INTERSEGMENT SALES ARE CRUDE OIL PRODUCED BY THE UPSTREAM AND SOLD TO THE DOWNSTREAM. OTHER INTERSEGMENT SALES

INCLUDE THOSE BETWEEN REFINERIES AND CHEMICAL PLANTS RELATED TO RAW MATERIALS, FEEDSTOCKS AND FINISHED PRODUCTS.

ALTHOUGH PRICE

LEVELS OF CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS MAY RISE OR FALL SIGNIFICANTLY OVER THE SHORT TO MEDIUM TERM DUE TO POLITICAL EVENTS, OPEC ACTIONS AND OTHER FACTORS, INDUSTRY ECONOMICS OVER THE LONG TERM WILL CONTINUE TO BE DRIVEN BY MARKET SUPPLY AND DEMAND.

ACCORDINGLY, THE CORPORATION TESTS THE VIABILITY OF ALL OF ITS INVESTMENTS OVER A BROAD RANGE OF FUTURE PRICES. THE CORPORATIONS ASSESSMENT IS THAT ITS OPERATIONS WILL CONTINUE TO BE SUCCESSFUL IN A VARIETY OF MARKET CONDITIONS. THIS IS THE

OUTCOME OF DISCIPLINED INVESTMENT AND ASSET MANAGEMENT PROGRAMS.

THE CORPORATION HAS AN ACTIVE ASSET MANAGEMENT PROGRAM IN WHICH

UNDERPERFORMING ASSETS ARE EITHER IMPROVED TO ACCEPTABLE LEVELS OR CONSIDERED FOR DIVESTMENT. THE ASSET MANAGEMENT PROGRAM INCLUDES A DISCIPLINED, REGULAR REVIEW TO ENSURE THAT ALL ASSETS ARE CONTRIBUTING TO THE CORPORATIONS STRATEGIC

OBJECTIVES. THE RESULT IS AN EFFICIENT CAPITAL BASE, AND THE CORPORATION HAS SELDOM HAD TO WRITE DOWN THE CARRYING VALUE OF ASSETS, EVEN DURING PERIODS OF LOW COMMODITY PRICES.

RISK MANAGEMENT

THE CORPORATIONS SIZE, STRONG CAPITAL STRUCTURE, GEOGRAPHIC DIVERSITY AND THE

COMPLEMENTARY NATURE OF THE UPSTREAM, DOWNSTREAM AND CHEMICAL BUSINESSES REDUCE THE CORPORATIONS ENTERPRISE-WIDE RISK FROM CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES, CURRENCY RATES AND COMMODITY PRICES. AS A RESULT, THE CORPORATION MAKES LIMITED USE OF

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS TO MITIGATE THE IMPACT OF SUCH CHANGES. WITH RESPECT TO DERIVATIVES ACTIVITIES, THE CORPORATION BELIEVES THAT THERE ARE NO MATERIAL MARKET OR CREDIT RISKS TO THE CORPORATIONS FINANCIAL POSITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR

LIQUIDITY AS A RESULT OF THE DERIVATIVES DESCRIBED IN NOTE 12. THE CORPORATION DOES NOT ENGAGE IN SPECULATIVE DERIVATIVE ACTIVITIES OR DERIVATIVE TRADING ACTIVITIES NOR DOES IT USE DERIVATIVES WITH LEVERAGED FEATURES. CREDIT RISK ASSOCIATED WITH THE

CORPORATIONS DERIVATIVE POSITION IS MITIGATED BY SEVERAL FACTORS, INCLUDING THE QUALITY OF AND FINANCIAL LIMITS PLACED ON DERIVATIVE COUNTERPARTIES. THE CORPORATION MAINTAINS A SYSTEM OF CONTROLS THAT INCLUDES THE AUTHORIZATION, REPORTING AND

MONITORING OF DERIVATIVE ACTIVITY.

THE CORPORATION IS EXPOSED TO CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES, PRIMARILY ON ITS SHORT-TERM DEBT AND THE

PORTION OF LONG-TERM DEBT THAT CARRIES FLOATING INTEREST RATES. THE IMPACT OF A 100-BASIS-POINT CHANGE IN INTEREST RATES AFFECTING THE CORPORATIONS DEBT WOULD NOT BE MATERIAL TO EARNINGS, CASH FLOW OR FAIR VALUE. ALTHOUGH THE CORPORATION

ISSUES LONG-TERM DEBT FROM TIME TO TIME AND MAINTAINS A COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAM, INTERNALLY GENERATED FUNDS ARE EXPECTED TO COVER THE MAJORITY OF ITS NET NEAR-TERM FINANCIAL REQUIREMENTS. HOWEVER, SOME JOINT-VENTURE PARTNERS ARE DEPENDENT ON THE

CREDIT MARKETS, AND THEIR FUNDING ABILITY MAY IMPACT THE DEVELOPMENT PACE OF JOINT-VENTURE PROJECTS.

THE CORPORATION CONDUCTS

BUSINESS IN MANY FOREIGN CURRENCIES AND IS SUBJECT TO EXCHANGE RATE RISK ON CASH FLOWS RELATED TO SALES, EXPENSES, FINANCING AND INVESTMENT TRANSACTIONS. THE IMPACTS OF FLUCTUATIONS IN EXCHANGE RATES ON EXXONMOBILS GEOGRAPHICALLY AND

FUNCTIONALLY DIVERSE OPERATIONS ARE VARIED AND OFTEN OFFSETTING IN AMOUNT. THE CORPORATION MAKES LIMITED USE OF CURRENCY EXCHANGE CONTRACTS TO MITIGATE THE IMPACT OF CHANGES IN CURRENCY VALUES, AND EXPOSURES RELATED TO THE CORPORATIONS LIMITED

USE OF THE CURRENCY EXCHANGE CONTRACTS ARE NOT MATERIAL.

INDEX TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

INFLATION AND OTHER UNCERTAINTIES

THE GENERAL RATE OF INFLATION IN MANY MAJOR COUNTRIES OF OPERATION HAS REMAINED MODERATE OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS, AND THE ASSOCIATED IMPACT ON NON-ENERGY COSTS HAS GENERALLY BEEN MITIGATED BY COST REDUCTIONS

FROM EFFICIENCY AND PRODUCTIVITY IMPROVEMENTS. INCREASED DEMAND FOR CERTAIN SERVICES AND MATERIALS HAS RESULTED IN HIGHER OPERATING AND CAPITAL COSTS IN RECENT YEARS. THE CORPORATION WORKS TO COUNTER UPWARD PRESSURE ON COSTS THROUGH ITS ECONOMIES OF

SCALE IN GLOBAL PROCUREMENT AND ITS EFFICIENT PROJECT MANAGEMENT PRACTICES.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

THE CORPORATIONS ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL REPORTING FAIRLY REFLECT ITS STRAIGHTFORWARD BUSINESS MODEL INVOLVING THE EXTRACTING, REFINING AND MARKETING OF

HYDROCARBONS AND HYDROCARBON-BASED PRODUCTS. THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN CONFORMITY WITH U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES (GAAP) REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS THAT AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF

ASSETS, LIABILITIES, REVENUES AND EXPENSES AND THE DISCLOSURE OF CONTINGENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. THE CORPORATIONS ACCOUNTING POLICIES ARE SUMMARIZED IN NOTE 1.

OIL AND GAS RESERVES

EVALUATIONS OF OIL AND GAS RESERVES ARE IMPORTANT TO THE EFFECTIVE MANAGEMENT OF

UPSTREAM ASSETS. THEY ARE INTEGRAL TO MAKING INVESTMENT DECISIONS ABOUT OIL AND GAS PROPERTIES SUCH AS WHETHER DEVELOPMENT SHOULD PROCEED. OIL AND GAS RESERVE QUANTITIES ARE ALSO USED AS THE BASIS FOR CALCULATING UNIT-OF-PRODUCTION DEPRECIATION

RATES AND FOR EVALUATING IMPAIRMENT.

OIL AND GAS RESERVES INCLUDE BOTH PROVED AND UNPROVED RESERVES. PROVED OIL AND GAS RESERVES ARE

THOSE QUANTITIES OF OIL AND GAS, WHICH, BY ANALYSIS OF GEOSCIENCE AND ENGINEERING DATA, CAN BE ESTIMATED WITH REASONABLE CERTAINTY TO BE ECONOMICALLY PRODUCIBLE. UNPROVED RESERVES ARE THOSE WITH LESS THAN REASONABLE CERTAINTY OF RECOVERABILITY AND

INCLUDE PROBABLE RESERVES. PROBABLE RESERVES ARE RESERVES THAT ARE MORE LIKELY TO BE RECOVERED THAN NOT.

THE ESTIMATION OF PROVED

RESERVES IS AN ONGOING PROCESS BASED ON RIGOROUS TECHNICAL EVALUATIONS, COMMERCIAL AND MARKET ASSESSMENT, AND DETAILED ANALYSIS OF WELL INFORMATION SUCH AS FLOW RATES AND RESERVOIR PRESSURE DECLINES. THE ESTIMATION OF PROVED RESERVES IS CONTROLLED

BY THE CORPORATION THROUGH LONG-STANDING APPROVAL GUIDELINES. RESERVE CHANGES ARE MADE WITHIN A WELL-ESTABLISHED, DISCIPLINED PROCESS DRIVEN BY SENIOR LEVEL GEOSCIENCE AND ENGINEERING PROFESSIONALS, ASSISTED BY THE RESERVES TECHNICAL OVERSIGHT GROUP

WHICH HAS SIGNIFICANT TECHNICAL EXPERIENCE, CULMINATING IN REVIEWS WITH AND APPROVAL BY SENIOR MANAGEMENT. NOTABLY, THE CORPORATION DOES NOT USE SPECIFIC QUANTITATIVE RESERVE TARGETS TO DETERMINE COMPENSATION. KEY FEATURES OF THE RESERVE ESTIMATION

PROCESS ARE COVERED IN DISCLOSURE OF RESERVES IN ITEM 2.

ALTHOUGH THE CORPORATION IS REASONABLY CERTAIN THAT PROVED RESERVES

WILL BE PRODUCED, THE TIMING AND AMOUNT RECOVERED CAN BE AFFECTED BY A NUMBER OF FACTORS INCLUDING COMPLETION OF DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS, RESERVOIR PERFORMANCE, REGULATORY APPROVALS AND SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN LONG-TERM OIL AND GAS PRICE LEVELS.

PROVED RESERVES CAN BE FURTHER SUBDIVIDED INTO DEVELOPED AND UNDEVELOPED RESERVES. THE PERCENTAGE OF PROVED DEVELOPED RESERVES WAS 65

PERCENT OF TOTAL PROVED RESERVES AT YEAR-END 2011 (INCLUDING BOTH CONSOLIDATED AND EQUITY COMPANY RESERVES), AND HAS BEEN OVER 60 PERCENT FOR THE LAST FIVE YEARS, INDICATING THAT PROVED RESERVES ARE CONSISTENTLY MOVED FROM UNDEVELOPED TO DEVELOPED

STATUS.

REVISIONS CAN INCLUDE UPWARD OR DOWNWARD CHANGES IN PREVIOUSLY ESTIMATED VOLUMES OF PROVED RESERVES FOR EXISTING FIELDS DUE

TO THE EVALUATION OR RE-EVALUATION OF (1) ALREADY AVAILABLE GEOLOGIC, RESERVOIR OR PRODUCTION DATA, (2) NEW GEOLOGIC, RESERVOIR OR PRODUCTION DATA OR (3) CHANGES IN PRICES AND COSTS THAT ARE USED IN THE ESTIMATION OF RESERVES.

REVISIONS CAN ALSO RESULT FROM SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY OR PRODUCTION EQUIPMENT/FACILITY CAPACITY.

THE CORPORATION

USES THE SUCCESSFUL EFFORTS METHOD TO ACCOUNT FOR ITS EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION ACTIVITIES. UNDER THIS METHOD, COSTS ARE ACCUMULATED ON A FIELD-BY-FIELD BASIS WITH CERTAIN EXPLORATORY EXPENDITURES AND EXPLORATORY DRY HOLES BEING

EXPENSED AS INCURRED. COSTS OF PRODUCTIVE WELLS AND DEVELOPMENT DRY HOLES ARE CAPITALIZED AND AMORTIZED ON THE UNIT-OF-PRODUCTION METHOD.

IMPACT

OF OIL AND GAS RESERVES ON DEPRECIATION.

THE CALCULATION OF UNIT-OF-PRODUCTION DEPRECIATION IS A CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATE THAT MEASURES THE DEPRECIATION OF UPSTREAM ASSETS. IT IS THE RATIO OF ACTUAL VOLUMES PRODUCED TO TOTAL PROVED DEVELOPED

RESERVES (THOSE PROVED RESERVES RECOVERABLE THROUGH EXISTING WELLS WITH EXISTING EQUIPMENT AND OPERATING METHODS), APPLIED TO THE ASSET COST. THE VOLUMES PRODUCED AND ASSET COST ARE KNOWN AND, WHILE PROVED DEVELOPED RESERVES HAVE A HIGH PROBABILITY

OF RECOVERABILITY, THEY ARE BASED ON ESTIMATES THAT ARE SUBJECT TO SOME VARIABILITY. WHILE THE REVISIONS THE CORPORATION HAS MADE IN THE PAST ARE AN INDICATOR OF VARIABILITY, THEY HAVE HAD A VERY SMALL IMPACT ON THE UNIT-OF-PRODUCTION RATES BECAUSE

THEY HAVE BEEN SMALL COMPARED TO THE LARGE RESERVES BASE.

IMPACT OF OIL AND GAS RESERVES AND PRICES ON TESTING FOR IMPAIRMENT.

PROVED OIL AND

GAS PROPERTIES HELD AND USED BY THE CORPORATION ARE REVIEWED FOR IMPAIRMENT WHENEVER EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THAT THE CARRYING AMOUNTS MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE. ASSETS ARE GROUPED AT THE LOWEST LEVEL FOR WHICH THERE ARE IDENTIFIABLE CASH

FLOWS THAT ARE LARGELY INDEPENDENT OF THE CASH FLOWS OF OTHER GROUPS OF ASSETS.

THE CORPORATION ESTIMATES THE FUTURE UNDISCOUNTED

CASH FLOWS OF THE AFFECTED PROPERTIES TO JUDGE THE RECOVERABILITY OF CARRYING AMOUNTS. IN GENERAL, ANALYSES ARE BASED ON PROVED RESERVES. WHERE PROBABLE RESERVES EXIST, AN APPROPRIATELY RISK-ADJUSTED AMOUNT OF THESE RESERVES MAY BE INCLUDED IN THE

IMPAIRMENT EVALUATION. AN ASSET WOULD BE IMPAIRED IF THE UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS WERE LESS THAN THE ASSETS CARRYING VALUE. IMPAIRMENTS ARE MEASURED BY THE AMOUNT BY WHICH THE CARRYING VALUE EXCEEDS THE ASSETS FAIR VALUE.

SIGNIFICANT UNPROVED PROPERTIES ARE ASSESSED FOR IMPAIRMENT INDIVIDUALLY, AND VALUATION ALLOWANCES AGAINST THE CAPITALIZED COSTS ARE RECORDED

BASED ON THE ESTIMATED ECONOMIC CHANCE OF SUCCESS AND THE LENGTH OF TIME THAT THE CORPORATION EXPECTS TO HOLD THE

51

TABLE OF CONTENTS

INDEX TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

PROPERTIES. PROPERTIES THAT ARE NOT INDIVIDUALLY SIGNIFICANT ARE AGGREGATED BY GROUPS AND AMORTIZED BASED ON DEVELOPMENT RISK AND AVERAGE HOLDING PERIOD.

THE CORPORATION PERFORMS ASSET VALUATION ANALYSES ON AN ONGOING BASIS AS A PART OF ITS ASSET MANAGEMENT PROGRAM. THESE ANALYSES ASSIST THE

CORPORATION IN ASSESSING WHETHER THE CARRYING AMOUNTS OF ANY OF ITS ASSETS MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE. IN ADDITION TO ESTIMATING OIL AND GAS RESERVE VOLUMES IN CONDUCTING THESE ANALYSES, IT IS ALSO NECESSARY TO ESTIMATE FUTURE OIL AND GAS PRICES.

TRIGGER EVENTS FOR IMPAIRMENT EVALUATION INCLUDE A SIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN CURRENT AND PROJECTED RESERVE VOLUMES, AN ACCUMULATION OF PROJECT COSTS SIGNIFICANTLY IN EXCESS OF THE AMOUNT ORIGINALLY EXPECTED, AND HISTORICAL AND FORECAST OPERATING

LOSSES.

IN GENERAL, THE CORPORATION DOES NOT VIEW TEMPORARILY LOW OIL AND GAS PRICES AS A TRIGGER EVENT FOR CONDUCTING THE IMPAIRMENT

TESTS. THE MARKETS FOR CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS HAVE A HISTORY OF SIGNIFICANT PRICE VOLATILITY. ALTHOUGH PRICES WILL OCCASIONALLY DROP SIGNIFICANTLY, INDUSTRY PRICES OVER THE LONG TERM WILL CONTINUE TO BE DRIVEN BY MARKET SUPPLY AND DEMAND. ON THE

SUPPLY SIDE, INDUSTRY PRODUCTION FROM MATURE FIELDS IS DECLINING, BUT THIS IS BEING OFFSET BY PRODUCTION FROM NEW DISCOVERIES AND FIELD DEVELOPMENTS. OPEC PRODUCTION POLICIES ALSO HAVE AN IMPACT ON WORLD OIL SUPPLIES. THE DEMAND SIDE IS LARGELY A

FUNCTION OF GLOBAL ECONOMIC GROWTH. THE RELATIVE GROWTH/DECLINE IN SUPPLY VERSUS DEMAND WILL DETERMINE INDUSTRY PRICES OVER THE LONG TERM, AND THESE CANNOT BE ACCURATELY PREDICTED.

ACCORDINGLY, ANY IMPAIRMENT TESTS THAT THE CORPORATION PERFORMS MAKE USE OF THE CORPORATIONS PRICE ASSUMPTIONS DEVELOPED IN THE ANNUAL

PLANNING AND BUDGETING PROCESS FOR THE CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS MARKETS, PETROLEUM PRODUCTS AND CHEMICALS. THESE ARE THE SAME PRICE ASSUMPTIONS THAT ARE USED FOR CAPITAL INVESTMENT DECISIONS. VOLUMES ARE BASED ON FIELD PRODUCTION PROFILES, WHICH

ARE UPDATED ANNUALLY. CASH FLOW ESTIMATES FOR IMPAIRMENT TESTING EXCLUDE THE EFFECTS OF DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS.

SUPPLEMENTAL

INFORMATION REGARDING OIL AND GAS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, CAPITALIZED COSTS AND RESERVES IS PROVIDED FOLLOWING THE NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. FUTURE PRICES USED FOR ANY IMPAIRMENT TESTS WILL VARY FROM THE ONES USED IN THE

SUPPLEMENTAL OIL AND GAS DISCLOSURE AND COULD BE LOWER OR HIGHER FOR ANY GIVEN YEAR.

ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS (ARO)

THE CORPORATION INCURS RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS FOR CERTAIN ASSETS AT THE TIME THEY ARE INSTALLED. THE FAIR VALUE OF THESE OBLIGATIONS ARE RECORDED AS LIABILITIES

ON A DISCOUNTED BASIS. IN THE ESTIMATION OF FAIR VALUE, THE CORPORATION USES ASSUMPTIONS AND JUDGMENTS REGARDING SUCH FACTORS AS THE EXISTENCE OF A LEGAL OBLIGATION FOR AN ARO; TECHNICAL ASSESSMENTS OF THE ASSETS; ESTIMATED AMOUNTS AND TIMING OF

SETTLEMENTS; DISCOUNT RATES; AND INFLATION RATES. AROS ARE DISCLOSED IN NOTE 8 TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

SUSPENDED EXPLORATORY WELL COSTS

THE CORPORATION CARRIES AS AN ASSET EXPLORATORY WELL COSTS WHEN THE WELL HAS FOUND A SUFFICIENT QUANTITY OF RESERVES TO JUSTIFY ITS COMPLETION AS

A PRODUCING WELL AND WHERE THE CORPORATION IS MAKING SUFFICIENT PROGRESS ASSESSING THE RESERVES AND THE ECONOMIC AND OPERATING VIABILITY OF THE PROJECT. EXPLORATORY WELL COSTS NOT MEETING THESE CRITERIA ARE CHARGED TO EXPENSE. THE FACTS AND

CIRCUMSTANCES THAT SUPPORT CONTINUED CAPITALIZATION OF SUSPENDED WELLS AS OF YEAR-END 2011 ARE DISCLOSED IN NOTE 9 TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

CONSOLIDATIONS

THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

INCLUDE THE ACCOUNTS OF THOSE SUBSIDIARIES THAT THE CORPORATION CONTROLS. THEY ALSO INCLUDE THE CORPORATIONS SHARE OF THE UNDIVIDED INTEREST IN CERTAIN UPSTREAM ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. AMOUNTS REPRESENTING THE CORPORATIONS PERCENTAGE

INTEREST IN THE UNDERLYING NET ASSETS OF OTHER SIGNIFICANT ENTITIES THAT IT DOES NOT CONTROL, BUT OVER WHICH IT EXERCISES SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE, ARE ACCOUNTED FOR USING THE EQUITY METHOD OF ACCOUNTING.

INVESTMENTS IN COMPANIES THAT ARE PARTIALLY OWNED BY THE CORPORATION ARE INTEGRAL TO THE CORPORATIONS OPERATIONS. IN SOME CASES THEY SERVE

TO BALANCE WORLDWIDE RISKS, AND IN OTHERS THEY PROVIDE THE ONLY AVAILABLE MEANS OF ENTRY INTO A PARTICULAR MARKET OR AREA OF INTEREST. THE OTHER PARTIES WHO ALSO HAVE AN EQUITY INTEREST IN THESE COMPANIES ARE EITHER INDEPENDENT THIRD PARTIES OR HOST

GOVERNMENTS THAT SHARE IN THE BUSINESS RESULTS ACCORDING TO THEIR PERCENTAGE OWNERSHIP. THE CORPORATION DOES NOT INVEST IN THESE COMPANIES IN ORDER TO REMOVE LIABILITIES FROM ITS BALANCE SHEET. IN FACT, THE CORPORATION HAS LONG BEEN ON RECORD

SUPPORTING AN ALTERNATIVE ACCOUNTING METHOD THAT WOULD REQUIRE EACH INVESTOR TO CONSOLIDATE ITS PERCENTAGE SHARE OF ALL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES IN THESE PARTIALLY OWNED COMPANIES RATHER THAN ONLY ITS PERCENTAGE IN THE NET EQUITY. THIS METHOD OF

ACCOUNTING FOR INVESTMENTS IN PARTIALLY OWNED COMPANIES IS NOT PERMITTED BY GAAP EXCEPT WHERE THE INVESTMENTS ARE IN THE DIRECT OWNERSHIP OF A SHARE OF UPSTREAM ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. HOWEVER, FOR PURPOSES OF CALCULATING RETURN ON AVERAGE CAPITAL

EMPLOYED, WHICH IS NOT COVERED BY GAAP STANDARDS, THE CORPORATION INCLUDES ITS SHARE OF DEBT OF THESE PARTIALLY-OWNED COMPANIES IN THE DETERMINATION OF AVERAGE CAPITAL EMPLOYED.

PENSION BENEFITS

THE CORPORATION AND ITS AFFILIATES SPONSOR OVER 100 DEFINED BENEFIT (PENSION) PLANS IN

ABOUT 50 COUNTRIES. PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS (NOTE 16) PROVIDES DETAILS ON PENSION OBLIGATIONS, FUND ASSETS AND PENSION EXPENSE.

SOME OF THESE PLANS (PRIMARILY NON-U.S.) PROVIDE PENSION BENEFITS THAT ARE PAID DIRECTLY BY THEIR SPONSORING AFFILIATES OUT OF CORPORATE CASH FLOW RATHER THAN A SEPARATE PENSION FUND. BOOK RESERVES ARE

ESTABLISHED FOR THESE PLANS BECAUSE TAX CONVENTIONS AND REGULATORY PRACTICES DO NOT ENCOURAGE ADVANCE FUNDING. THE PORTION OF THE PENSION COST ATTRIBUTABLE TO EMPLOYEE SERVICE IS EXPENSED AS SERVICES ARE RENDERED. THE PORTION ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE

INCREASE IN PENSION OBLIGATIONS DUE TO THE PASSAGE OF TIME IS EXPENSED OVER THE TERM OF THE OBLIGATIONS, WHICH ENDS WHEN ALL BENEFITS ARE PAID. THE PRIMARY DIFFERENCE IN PENSION EXPENSE FOR UNFUNDED VERSUS FUNDED PLANS IS THAT PENSION EXPENSE FOR

FUNDED PLANS ALSO INCLUDES A CREDIT FOR THE EXPECTED LONG-TERM RETURN ON FUND ASSETS.

52

TABLE OF CONTENTS

INDEX TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

FOR FUNDED PLANS, INCLUDING THOSE IN THE UNITED STATES, PENSION OBLIGATIONS ARE FINANCED IN ADVANCE

THROUGH SEGREGATED ASSETS OR INSURANCE ARRANGEMENTS. THESE PLANS ARE MANAGED IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE REQUIREMENTS OF GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORITIES AND MEET OR EXCEED REQUIRED FUNDING LEVELS AS MEASURED BY RELEVANT ACTUARIAL AND GOVERNMENT STANDARDS AT THE

MANDATED MEASUREMENT DATES. IN DETERMINING LIABILITIES AND REQUIRED CONTRIBUTIONS, THESE STANDARDS OFTEN REQUIRE APPROACHES AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT DIFFER FROM THOSE USED FOR ACCOUNTING PURPOSES.

THE CORPORATION WILL CONTINUE TO MAKE CONTRIBUTIONS TO THESE FUNDED PLANS AS NECESSARY. ALL DEFINED-BENEFIT PENSION OBLIGATIONS, REGARDLESS OF

THE FUNDING STATUS OF THE UNDERLYING PLANS, ARE FULLY SUPPORTED BY THE FINANCIAL STRENGTH OF THE CORPORATION OR THE RESPECTIVE SPONSORING AFFILIATE.

PENSION ACCOUNTING REQUIRES EXPLICIT ASSUMPTIONS REGARDING, AMONG OTHERS, THE LONG-TERM EXPECTED EARNINGS RATE ON FUND ASSETS, THE DISCOUNT RATE FOR THE BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS AND THE LONG-TERM RATE FOR FUTURE

SALARY INCREASES. PENSION ASSUMPTIONS ARE REVIEWED ANNUALLY BY OUTSIDE ACTUARIES AND SENIOR MANAGEMENT. THESE ASSUMPTIONS ARE ADJUSTED AS APPROPRIATE TO REFLECT CHANGES IN MARKET RATES AND OUTLOOK. THE LONG-TERM EXPECTED EARNINGS RATE ON U.S.

PENSION PLAN ASSETS IN 2011 WAS 7.5 PERCENT. THE 10-YEAR AND 20-YEAR ACTUAL RETURNS ON U.S. PENSION PLAN ASSETS WERE 6 PERCENT AND 9 PERCENT, RESPECTIVELY. THE CORPORATION ESTABLISHES THE LONG-TERM EXPECTED RATE OF RETURN BY DEVELOPING A

FORWARD-LOOKING, LONG-TERM RETURN ASSUMPTION FOR EACH PENSION FUND ASSET CLASS, TAKING INTO ACCOUNT FACTORS SUCH AS THE EXPECTED REAL RETURN FOR THE SPECIFIC ASSET CLASS AND INFLATION. A SINGLE, LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN IS THEN CALCULATED AS THE

WEIGHTED AVERAGE OF THE TARGET ASSET ALLOCATION AND THE LONG-TERM RETURN ASSUMPTION FOR EACH ASSET CLASS. A WORLDWIDE REDUCTION OF 0.5 PERCENT IN THE LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN ON ASSETS WOULD INCREASE ANNUAL PENSION EXPENSE BY APPROXIMATELY $140

MILLION BEFORE TAX.

DIFFERENCES BETWEEN ACTUAL RETURNS ON FUND ASSETS AND THE LONG-TERM EXPECTED RETURN ARE NOT RECOGNIZED IN PENSION

EXPENSE IN THE YEAR THAT THE DIFFERENCE OCCURS. SUCH DIFFERENCES ARE DEFERRED, ALONG WITH OTHER ACTUARIAL GAINS AND LOSSES, AND ARE AMORTIZED INTO PENSION EXPENSE OVER THE EXPECTED REMAINING SERVICE LIFE OF EMPLOYEES.

LITIGATION CONTINGENCIES

A VARIETY OF CLAIMS HAVE BEEN

MADE AGAINST THE CORPORATION AND CERTAIN OF ITS CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES IN A NUMBER OF PENDING LAWSUITS. MANAGEMENT HAS REGULAR LITIGATION REVIEWS, INCLUDING UPDATES FROM CORPORATE AND OUTSIDE COUNSEL, TO ASSESS THE NEED FOR ACCOUNTING RECOGNITION

OR DISCLOSURE OF THESE CONTINGENCIES. THE STATUS OF SIGNIFICANT CLAIMS IS SUMMARIZED IN NOTE 15.

THE CORPORATION ACCRUES AN

UNDISCOUNTED LIABILITY FOR THOSE CONTINGENCIES WHERE THE INCURRENCE OF A LOSS IS PROBABLE, AND THE AMOUNT CAN BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED. THESE AMOUNTS ARE NOT REDUCED BY AMOUNTS THAT MAY BE RECOVERED UNDER INSURANCE OR CLAIMS AGAINST THIRD PARTIES,

BUT UNDISCOUNTED RECEIVABLES FROM INSURERS OR OTHER THIRD PARTIES MAY BE ACCRUED SEPARATELY. THE CORPORATION REVISES SUCH ACCRUALS IN LIGHT OF NEW INFORMATION. FOR CONTINGENCIES WHERE AN UNFAVORABLE OUTCOME IS REASONABLY POSSIBLE AND WHICH ARE

SIGNIFICANT, THE CORPORATION DISCLOSES THE NATURE OF THE CONTINGENCY AND, WHERE FEASIBLE, AN ESTIMATE OF THE POSSIBLE LOSS. FOR PURPOSES OF OUR LITIGATION CONTINGENCY DISCLOSURES, SIGNIFICANT INCLUDES MATERIAL MATTERS AS WELL AS OTHER

ITEMS WHICH MANAGEMENT BELIEVES SHOULD BE DISCLOSED.

MANAGEMENT JUDGMENT IS REQUIRED RELATED TO CONTINGENT LIABILITIES AND THE

OUTCOME OF LITIGATION BECAUSE BOTH ARE DIFFICULT TO PREDICT. HOWEVER, THE CORPORATION HAS BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN DEFENDING LITIGATION IN THE PAST. PAYMENTS HAVE NOT HAD A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OPERATIONS OR FINANCIAL CONDITION. IN THE

CORPORATIONS EXPERIENCE, LARGE CLAIMS OFTEN DO NOT RESULT IN LARGE AWARDS. LARGE AWARDS ARE OFTEN REVERSED OR SUBSTANTIALLY REDUCED AS A RESULT OF APPEAL OR SETTLEMENT.

TAX CONTINGENCIES

THE CORPORATION IS SUBJECT TO INCOME TAXATION IN MANY JURISDICTIONS AROUND THE WORLD.

SIGNIFICANT MANAGEMENT JUDGMENT IS REQUIRED IN THE ACCOUNTING FOR INCOME TAX CONTINGENCIES AND TAX DISPUTES BECAUSE THE OUTCOMES ARE OFTEN DIFFICULT TO PREDICT.

THE BENEFITS OF UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS THAT THE CORPORATION HAS TAKEN OR EXPECTS TO TAKE IN ITS INCOME TAX RETURNS ARE RECOGNIZED IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IF MANAGEMENT CONCLUDES THAT IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN

NOT THAT THE POSITION WILL BE SUSTAINED WITH THE TAX AUTHORITIES. FOR A POSITION THAT IS LIKELY TO BE SUSTAINED, THE BENEFIT RECOGNIZED IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IS MEASURED AT THE LARGEST AMOUNT THAT IS GREATER THAN 50 PERCENT LIKELY OF BEING

REALIZED. A RESERVE IS ESTABLISHED FOR THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A POSITION TAKEN OR EXPECTED TO BE TAKEN IN AN INCOME TAX RETURN AND THE AMOUNT RECOGNIZED IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. THE CORPORATIONS UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS AND A DESCRIPTION

OF OPEN TAX YEARS ARE SUMMARIZED IN NOTE 18.

FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION

THE METHOD OF TRANSLATING THE FOREIGN CURRENCY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF THE CORPORATIONS INTERNATIONAL SUBSIDIARIES INTO U.S. DOLLARS IS PRESCRIBED BY GAAP. UNDER THESE PRINCIPLES, IT IS NECESSARY TO

SELECT THE FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY OF THESE SUBSIDIARIES. THE FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY IS THE CURRENCY OF THE PRIMARY ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH THE SUBSIDIARY OPERATES. MANAGEMENT SELECTS THE FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY AFTER EVALUATING THIS ECONOMIC

ENVIRONMENT.

FACTORS CONSIDERED BY MANAGEMENT WHEN DETERMINING THE FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY FOR A SUBSIDIARY INCLUDE THE CURRENCY USED FOR

CASH FLOWS RELATED TO INDIVIDUAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES; THE RESPONSIVENESS OF SALES PRICES TO CHANGES IN EXCHANGE RATES; THE HISTORY OF INFLATION IN THE COUNTRY; WHETHER SALES ARE INTO LOCAL MARKETS OR EXPORTED; THE CURRENCY USED TO ACQUIRE RAW

MATERIALS, LABOR, SERVICES AND SUPPLIES; SOURCES OF FINANCING; AND SIGNIFICANCE OF INTERCOMPANY TRANSACTIONS.

IN OUR OPINION, THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS AND THE RELATED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME, COMPREHENSIVE INCOME, CHANGES IN EQUITY AND CASH FLOWS PRESENT FAIRLY, IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS,

THE FINANCIAL POSITION OF EXXON MOBIL CORPORATION AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES AT DECEMBER 31, 2011, AND 2010, AND THE RESULTS OF THEIR OPERATIONS AND THEIR CASH FLOWS FOR EACH OF THE THREE YEARS IN THE PERIOD ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2011, IN

CONFORMITY WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. ALSO IN OUR OPINION, THE CORPORATION MAINTAINED, IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS, EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2011,

BASED ON CRITERIA ESTABLISHED IN

INTERNAL CONTROL  INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK

ISSUED BY THE COMMITTEE OF SPONSORING ORGANIZATIONS OF THE TREADWAY COMMISSION (COSO). THE CORPORATIONS MANAGEMENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THESE FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS, FOR MAINTAINING EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AND FOR ITS ASSESSMENT OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, INCLUDED IN THE ACCOMPANYING MANAGEMENTS REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER

FINANCIAL REPORTING. OUR RESPONSIBILITY IS TO EXPRESS OPINIONS ON THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND ON THE CORPORATIONS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING BASED ON OUR INTEGRATED AUDITS. WE CONDUCTED OUR AUDITS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE

STANDARDS OF THE PUBLIC COMPANY ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BOARD (UNITED STATES). THOSE STANDARDS REQUIRE THAT WE PLAN AND PERFORM THE AUDITS TO OBTAIN REASONABLE ASSURANCE ABOUT WHETHER THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE FREE OF MATERIAL MISSTATEMENT AND

WHETHER EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING WAS MAINTAINED IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS. OUR AUDITS OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED EXAMINING, ON A TEST BASIS, EVIDENCE SUPPORTING THE AMOUNTS AND DISCLOSURES IN THE FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS, ASSESSING THE ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES USED AND SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES MADE BY MANAGEMENT, AND EVALUATING THE OVERALL FINANCIAL STATEMENT PRESENTATION. OUR AUDIT OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING INCLUDED OBTAINING AN

UNDERSTANDING OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, ASSESSING THE RISK THAT A MATERIAL WEAKNESS EXISTS, AND TESTING AND EVALUATING THE DESIGN AND OPERATING EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL CONTROL BASED ON THE ASSESSED RISK. OUR AUDITS ALSO

INCLUDED PERFORMING SUCH OTHER PROCEDURES AS WE CONSIDERED NECESSARY IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR AUDITS PROVIDE A REASONABLE BASIS FOR OUR OPINIONS.

A COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING IS A PROCESS DESIGNED TO PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING THE RELIABILITY OF FINANCIAL REPORTING AND THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR

EXTERNAL PURPOSES IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES. A COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING INCLUDES THOSE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES THAT (I) PERTAIN TO THE MAINTENANCE OF RECORDS THAT, IN REASONABLE

DETAIL, ACCURATELY AND FAIRLY REFLECT THE TRANSACTIONS AND DISPOSITIONS OF THE ASSETS OF THE COMPANY; (II) PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE THAT TRANSACTIONS ARE RECORDED AS NECESSARY TO PERMIT PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH

GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES, AND THAT RECEIPTS AND EXPENDITURES OF THE COMPANY ARE BEING MADE ONLY IN ACCORDANCE WITH AUTHORIZATIONS OF MANAGEMENT AND DIRECTORS OF THE COMPANY; AND (III) PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING

PREVENTION OR TIMELY DETECTION OF UNAUTHORIZED ACQUISITION, USE, OR DISPOSITION OF THE COMPANYS ASSETS THAT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

BECAUSE OF ITS INHERENT LIMITATIONS, INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING MAY NOT PREVENT OR DETECT MISSTATEMENTS. ALSO, PROJECTIONS OF ANY EVALUATION OF EFFECTIVENESS TO FUTURE PERIODS ARE SUBJECT TO THE

RISK THAT CONTROLS MAY BECOME INADEQUATE BECAUSE OF CHANGES IN CONDITIONS, OR THAT THE DEGREE OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE POLICIES OR PROCEDURES MAY DETERIORATE.

ALSO INCLUDE THE CORPORATIONS SHARE OF THE UNDIVIDED INTEREST IN CERTAIN UPSTREAM ASSETS AND LIABILITIES.

THE CORPORATIONS PERCENTAGE INTEREST IN THE UNDERLYING NET ASSETS OF ENTITIES THAT IT DOES NOT CONTROL, BUT OVER WHICH IT EXERCISES SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE, ARE INCLUDED IN INVESTMENTS, ADVANCES AND LONG-TERM RECEIVABLES. THE

CORPORATIONS SHARE OF THE NET INCOME OF THESE COMPANIES IS INCLUDED IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF INCOME CAPTION INCOME FROM EQUITY AFFILIATES.

MAJORITY OWNERSHIP IS NORMALLY THE INDICATOR OF CONTROL THAT IS THE BASIS ON WHICH SUBSIDIARIES ARE CONSOLIDATED. HOWEVER, CERTAIN FACTORS MAY INDICATE THAT A MAJORITY-OWNED INVESTMENT IS NOT CONTROLLED AND

THEREFORE SHOULD BE ACCOUNTED FOR USING THE EQUITY METHOD OF ACCOUNTING. THESE FACTORS OCCUR WHERE THE MINORITY SHAREHOLDERS ARE GRANTED BY LAW OR BY CONTRACT SUBSTANTIVE PARTICIPATING RIGHTS. THESE INCLUDE THE RIGHT TO APPROVE OPERATING POLICIES,

EXPENSE BUDGETS, FINANCING AND INVESTMENT PLANS, AND MANAGEMENT COMPENSATION AND SUCCESSION PLANS.

THE CORPORATIONS SHARE OF

THE CUMULATIVE FOREIGN EXCHANGE TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENT FOR EQUITY METHOD INVESTMENTS IS REPORTED IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF CHANGES IN EQUITY.

EVIDENCE OF LOSS IN VALUE THAT MIGHT INDICATE IMPAIRMENT OF INVESTMENTS IN COMPANIES ACCOUNTED FOR ON THE EQUITY METHOD IS ASSESSED TO DETERMINE IF SUCH EVIDENCE REPRESENTS A LOSS IN VALUE OF THE

CORPORATIONS INVESTMENT THAT IS OTHER THAN TEMPORARY. EXAMPLES OF KEY INDICATORS INCLUDE A HISTORY OF OPERATING LOSSES, A NEGATIVE EARNINGS AND CASH FLOW OUTLOOK, SIGNIFICANT DOWNWARD REVISIONS TO OIL AND GAS RESERVES, AND THE FINANCIAL

CONDITION AND PROSPECTS FOR THE INVESTEES BUSINESS SEGMENT OR GEOGRAPHIC REGION. IF EVIDENCE OF AN OTHER THAN TEMPORARY LOSS IN FAIR VALUE BELOW CARRYING AMOUNT IS DETERMINED, AN IMPAIRMENT IS RECOGNIZED. IN THE ABSENCE OF MARKET PRICES FOR

THE INVESTMENT, DISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS ARE USED TO ASSESS FAIR VALUE.

REVENUE RECOGNITION.

THE CORPORATION GENERALLY SELLS CRUDE OIL, NATURAL

GAS AND PETROLEUM AND CHEMICAL PRODUCTS UNDER SHORT-TERM AGREEMENTS AT PREVAILING MARKET PRICES. IN SOME CASES (E.G., NATURAL GAS), PRODUCTS MAY BE SOLD UNDER LONG-TERM AGREEMENTS, WITH PERIODIC PRICE ADJUSTMENTS. REVENUES ARE RECOGNIZED WHEN THE

PRODUCTS ARE DELIVERED, WHICH OCCURS WHEN THE CUSTOMER HAS TAKEN TITLE AND HAS ASSUMED THE RISKS AND REWARDS OF OWNERSHIP, PRICES ARE FIXED OR DETERMINABLE AND COLLECTIBILITY IS REASONABLY ASSURED.

REVENUES FROM THE PRODUCTION OF NATURAL GAS PROPERTIES IN WHICH THE CORPORATION HAS AN INTEREST WITH OTHER PRODUCERS ARE RECOGNIZED ON THE BASIS

OF THE CORPORATIONS NET WORKING INTEREST. DIFFERENCES BETWEEN ACTUAL PRODUCTION AND NET WORKING INTEREST VOLUMES ARE NOT SIGNIFICANT.

PURCHASES AND SALES OF INVENTORY WITH THE SAME COUNTERPARTY THAT ARE ENTERED INTO IN CONTEMPLATION OF ONE ANOTHER ARE COMBINED AND RECORDED AS EXCHANGES MEASURED AT THE BOOK VALUE OF THE ITEM SOLD.

SALES-BASED TAXES.

THE CORPORATION REPORTS SALES, EXCISE AND VALUE-ADDED TAXES ON SALES TRANSACTIONS ON A GROSS BASIS IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF

INCOME (INCLUDED IN BOTH REVENUES AND COSTS).

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS.

THE CORPORATION MAKES LIMITED USE OF DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS. THE

CORPORATION DOES NOT ENGAGE IN SPECULATIVE DERIVATIVE ACTIVITIES OR DERIVATIVE TRADING ACTIVITIES, NOR DOES IT USE DERIVATIVES WITH LEVERAGED FEATURES. WHEN THE CORPORATION DOES ENTER INTO DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS, IT IS TO OFFSET EXPOSURES

ASSOCIATED WITH INTEREST RATES, FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES AND HYDROCARBON PRICES THAT ARISE FROM EXISTING ASSETS, LIABILITIES AND FORECASTED TRANSACTIONS.

THE GAINS AND LOSSES RESULTING FROM CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF DERIVATIVES ARE RECORDED IN INCOME. IN SOME CASES, THE CORPORATION DESIGNATES DERIVATIVES AS FAIR VALUE HEDGES, IN WHICH CASE THE GAINS AND LOSSES

ARE OFFSET IN INCOME BY THE GAINS AND LOSSES ARISING FROM CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE UNDERLYING HEDGED ITEM.

FAIR VALUE.

FAIR VALUE IS

THE PRICE THAT WOULD BE RECEIVED TO SELL AN ASSET OR PAID TO TRANSFER A LIABILITY IN AN ORDERLY TRANSACTION BETWEEN MARKET PARTICIPANTS. HIERARCHY LEVELS 1, 2 AND 3 ARE TERMS FOR THE PRIORITY OF INPUTS TO VALUATION TECHNIQUES USED TO MEASURE FAIR

VALUE. HIERARCHY LEVEL 1 INPUTS ARE QUOTED PRICES IN ACTIVE MARKETS FOR IDENTICAL ASSETS OR LIABILITIES. HIERARCHY LEVEL 2 INPUTS ARE INPUTS OTHER THAN QUOTED PRICES INCLUDED WITHIN LEVEL 1 THAT ARE DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY OBSERVABLE FOR THE ASSET OR

LIABILITY. HIERARCHY LEVEL 3 INPUTS ARE INPUTS THAT ARE NOT OBSERVABLE IN THE MARKET.

INVENTORIES.

CRUDE OIL, PRODUCTS AND MERCHANDISE INVENTORIES ARE CARRIED AT THE LOWER OF CURRENT MARKET

VALUE OR COST (GENERALLY DETERMINED UNDER THE LAST-IN, FIRST-OUT METHOD  LIFO). INVENTORY COSTS INCLUDE EXPENDITURES AND OTHER CHARGES (INCLUDING DEPRECIATION) DIRECTLY AND INDIRECTLY INCURRED IN BRINGING THE INVENTORY TO ITS EXISTING

CONDITION AND LOCATION. SELLING EXPENSES AND GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES ARE REPORTED AS PERIOD COSTS AND EXCLUDED FROM INVENTORY COST. INVENTORIES OF MATERIALS AND SUPPLIES ARE VALUED AT COST OR LESS.

PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT.

DEPRECIATION, DEPLETION AND AMORTIZATION, BASED ON COST LESS ESTIMATED SALVAGE VALUE OF THE ASSET, ARE PRIMARILY DETERMINED

UNDER EITHER THE UNIT-OF-PRODUCTION METHOD OR THE STRAIGHT-LINE METHOD, WHICH IS BASED ON ESTIMATED ASSET SERVICE LIFE TAKING OBSOLESCENCE INTO CONSIDERATION. MAINTENANCE AND REPAIRS, INCLUDING PLANNED MAJOR MAINTENANCE, ARE EXPENSED AS INCURRED.

MAJOR RENEWALS AND IMPROVEMENTS ARE CAPITALIZED AND THE ASSETS REPLACED ARE RETIRED.

INTEREST COSTS INCURRED TO FINANCE EXPENDITURES

DURING THE CONSTRUCTION PHASE OF MULTIYEAR PROJECTS ARE CAPITALIZED AS PART OF THE HISTORICAL COST OF ACQUIRING THE CONSTRUCTED ASSETS. THE PROJECT CONSTRUCTION PHASE COMMENCES WITH THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE DETAILED ENGINEERING DESIGN AND ENDS WHEN

THE CONSTRUCTED ASSETS ARE READY FOR THEIR INTENDED USE. CAPITALIZED INTEREST COSTS ARE INCLUDED IN PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT AND ARE DEPRECIATED OVER THE SERVICE LIFE OF THE RELATED ASSETS.

THE CORPORATION USES THE SUCCESSFUL EFFORTS METHOD TO ACCOUNT FOR ITS EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION ACTIVITIES. UNDER THIS METHOD, COSTS

ARE ACCUMULATED ON A FIELD-BY-FIELD BASIS WITH CERTAIN EXPLORATORY EXPENDITURES AND EXPLORATORY DRY HOLES BEING EXPENSED AS INCURRED. COSTS OF PRODUCTIVE WELLS AND DEVELOPMENT DRY HOLES ARE CAPITALIZED AND AMORTIZED ON THE UNIT-OF-PRODUCTION METHOD.

THE CORPORATION CARRIES AS AN ASSET EXPLORATORY WELL COSTS WHEN THE WELL HAS FOUND A SUFFICIENT QUANTITY OF RESERVES TO JUSTIFY ITS

COMPLETION AS A PRODUCING WELL AND WHERE THE CORPORATION IS MAKING SUFFICIENT PROGRESS ASSESSING THE RESERVES AND THE ECONOMIC AND OPERATING VIABILITY OF THE PROJECT. EXPLORATORY WELL COSTS NOT MEETING THESE CRITERIA ARE CHARGED TO EXPENSE. OTHER

EXPLORATORY EXPENDITURES, INCLUDING GEOPHYSICAL COSTS AND ANNUAL LEASE RENTALS, ARE EXPENSED AS INCURRED.

ACQUISITION COSTS OF PROVED

PROPERTIES ARE AMORTIZED USING A UNIT-OF-PRODUCTION METHOD, COMPUTED ON THE BASIS OF TOTAL PROVED OIL AND GAS RESERVES.

CAPITALIZED

EXPLORATORY DRILLING AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH PRODUCTIVE DEPLETABLE EXTRACTIVE PROPERTIES ARE AMORTIZED USING UNIT-OF-PRODUCTION RATES BASED ON THE AMOUNT OF PROVED DEVELOPED RESERVES OF OIL, GAS AND OTHER MINERALS THAT ARE ESTIMATED TO

BE RECOVERABLE FROM EXISTING FACILITIES USING CURRENT OPERATING METHODS.

UNDER THE UNIT-OF-PRODUCTION METHOD, OIL AND GAS VOLUMES ARE

CONSIDERED PRODUCED ONCE THEY HAVE BEEN MEASURED THROUGH METERS AT CUSTODY TRANSFER OR SALES TRANSACTION POINTS AT THE OUTLET VALVE ON THE LEASE OR FIELD STORAGE TANK.

PRODUCTION COSTS ARE EXPENSED AS INCURRED. PRODUCTION INVOLVES LIFTING THE OIL AND GAS TO THE SURFACE AND GATHERING, TREATING, FIELD PROCESSING AND FIELD STORAGE OF THE OIL AND GAS. THE PRODUCTION FUNCTION

NORMALLY TERMINATES AT THE OUTLET VALVE ON THE LEASE OR FIELD PRODUCTION STORAGE TANK. PRODUCTION COSTS ARE THOSE INCURRED TO OPERATE AND MAINTAIN THE CORPORATIONS WELLS AND RELATED EQUIPMENT AND FACILITIES. THEY BECOME PART OF THE COST OF OIL

AND GAS PRODUCED. THESE COSTS, SOMETIMES REFERRED TO AS LIFTING COSTS, INCLUDE SUCH ITEMS AS LABOR COSTS TO OPERATE THE WELLS AND RELATED EQUIPMENT; REPAIR AND MAINTENANCE COSTS ON THE WELLS AND EQUIPMENT; MATERIALS, SUPPLIES AND ENERGY COSTS

REQUIRED TO OPERATE THE WELLS AND RELATED EQUIPMENT; AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES RELATED TO THE PRODUCTION ACTIVITY.

PROVED OIL AND

GAS PROPERTIES HELD AND USED BY THE CORPORATION ARE REVIEWED FOR IMPAIRMENT WHENEVER EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THAT THE CARRYING AMOUNTS MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE. ASSETS ARE GROUPED AT THE LOWEST LEVEL FOR WHICH THERE ARE

IDENTIFIABLE CASH FLOWS THAT ARE LARGELY INDEPENDENT OF THE CASH FLOWS OF OTHER GROUPS OF ASSETS.

THE CORPORATION ESTIMATES THE

FUTURE UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS OF THE AFFECTED PROPERTIES TO JUDGE THE RECOVERABILITY OF CARRYING AMOUNTS. CASH FLOWS USED IN IMPAIRMENT EVALUATIONS ARE DEVELOPED USING ANNUALLY UPDATED CORPORATE PLAN INVESTMENT EVALUATION ASSUMPTIONS FOR CRUDE OIL

COMMODITY PRICES AND FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES. ANNUAL VOLUMES ARE BASED ON FIELD PRODUCTION PROFILES, WHICH ARE ALSO UPDATED ANNUALLY. PRICES FOR NATURAL GAS AND OTHER PRODUCTS ARE BASED ON CORPORATE PLAN ASSUMPTIONS DEVELOPED ANNUALLY BY

MAJOR REGION AND ALSO FOR INVESTMENT EVALUATION PURPOSES. CASH FLOW ESTIMATES FOR IMPAIRMENT TESTING EXCLUDE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS.

IMPAIRMENT ANALYSES ARE GENERALLY BASED ON PROVED RESERVES. WHERE PROBABLE RESERVES EXIST, AN APPROPRIATELY RISK-ADJUSTED AMOUNT OF THESE

RESERVES MAY BE INCLUDED IN THE IMPAIRMENT EVALUATION. IMPAIRMENTS ARE MEASURED BY THE AMOUNT THE CARRYING VALUE EXCEEDS THE FAIR VALUE.

SIGNIFICANT UNPROVED PROPERTIES ARE ASSESSED FOR IMPAIRMENT INDIVIDUALLY, AND VALUATION ALLOWANCES AGAINST THE CAPITALIZED COSTS ARE RECORDED BASED ON THE ESTIMATED ECONOMIC CHANCE OF SUCCESS AND THE LENGTH OF

TIME THAT THE CORPORATION EXPECTS TO HOLD THE PROPERTIES. PROPERTIES THAT ARE NOT INDIVIDUALLY SIGNIFICANT ARE AGGREGATED BY GROUPS AND AMORTIZED BASED ON DEVELOPMENT RISK AND AVERAGE HOLDING PERIOD. THE VALUATION ALLOWANCES ARE REVIEWED AT LEAST

ANNUALLY.

GAINS ON SALES OF PROVED AND UNPROVED PROPERTIES ARE ONLY RECOGNIZED WHEN THERE IS NO UNCERTAINTY ABOUT THE RECOVERY OF

COSTS APPLICABLE TO ANY INTEREST RETAINED OR WHERE THERE IS NO SUBSTANTIAL OBLIGATION FOR FUTURE PERFORMANCE BY THE CORPORATION.

LOSSES ON PROPERTIES SOLD ARE RECOGNIZED WHEN INCURRED OR WHEN THE PROPERTIES ARE HELD FOR SALE AND THE FAIR VALUE OF THE PROPERTIES IS LESS THAN

THE CARRYING VALUE.

ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS AND ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES.

THE CORPORATION INCURS RETIREMENT

OBLIGATIONS FOR CERTAIN ASSETS AT THE TIME THEY ARE INSTALLED. THE FAIR VALUES OF THESE OBLIGATIONS ARE RECORDED AS LIABILITIES ON A DISCOUNTED BASIS. THE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THESE LIABILITIES ARE CAPITALIZED AS PART OF THE RELATED ASSETS AND

DEPRECIATED. OVER TIME, THE LIABILITIES ARE ACCRETED FOR THE CHANGE IN THEIR PRESENT VALUE.

LIABILITIES FOR ENVIRONMENTAL COSTS ARE

RECORDED WHEN IT IS PROBABLE THAT OBLIGATIONS HAVE BEEN INCURRED AND THE AMOUNTS CAN BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED. THESE LIABILITIES ARE NOT REDUCED BY POSSIBLE RECOVERIES FROM THIRD PARTIES AND PROJECTED CASH EXPENDITURES ARE NOT DISCOUNTED.

FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION.

THE CORPORATION SELECTS THE FUNCTIONAL REPORTING CURRENCY FOR ITS INTERNATIONAL SUBSIDIARIES BASED ON THE CURRENCY OF THE

PRIMARY ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH EACH SUBSIDIARY OPERATES.

DOWNSTREAM AND CHEMICAL OPERATIONS PRIMARILY USE THE LOCAL CURRENCY.

HOWEVER, THE U.S. DOLLAR IS USED IN COUNTRIES WITH A HISTORY OF HIGH INFLATION (PRIMARILY IN LATIN AMERICA) AND SINGAPORE, WHICH PREDOMINANTLY SELLS INTO THE U.S. DOLLAR EXPORT MARKET. UPSTREAM OPERATIONS WHICH ARE RELATIVELY SELF-CONTAINED AND

INTEGRATED WITHIN A PARTICULAR COUNTRY, SUCH AS CANADA, THE UNITED KINGDOM, NORWAY AND CONTINENTAL EUROPE, USE THE LOCAL CURRENCY. SOME UPSTREAM OPERATIONS, PRIMARILY IN ASIA AND AFRICA, USE THE U.S. DOLLAR BECAUSE THEY PREDOMINANTLY SELL CRUDE AND

NATURAL GAS PRODUCTION INTO U.S. DOLLAR-DENOMINATED MARKETS.

FOR ALL OPERATIONS, GAINS OR LOSSES FROM REMEASURING FOREIGN CURRENCY

TRANSACTIONS INTO THE FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY ARE INCLUDED IN INCOME.

STOCK-BASED PAYMENTS.

THE CORPORATION AWARDS STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION TO

EMPLOYEES IN THE FORM OF RESTRICTED STOCK AND RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS. COMPENSATION EXPENSE IS MEASURED BY THE MARKET PRICE OF THE RESTRICTED SHARES AT THE DATE OF GRANT AND IS RECOGNIZED IN THE INCOME STATEMENT OVER THE REQUISITE SERVICE PERIOD OF

EACH AWARD. SEE NOTE 14, INCENTIVE PROGRAM, FOR FURTHER DETAILS.

ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS

THE CORPORATION INCURS RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS FOR ITS UPSTREAM ASSETS. THE FAIR VALUES OF THESE OBLIGATIONS ARE RECORDED AS LIABILITIES ON A DISCOUNTED BASIS, WHICH IS TYPICALLY AT THE TIME THE ASSETS ARE

INSTALLED. THE CORPORATION USES ESTIMATES, ASSUMPTIONS AND JUDGMENTS REGARDING SUCH FACTORS AS THE EXISTENCE OF A LEGAL OBLIGATION FOR AN ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATION; TECHNICAL ASSESSMENTS OF THE ASSETS; ESTIMATED AMOUNTS AND TIMING OF SETTLEMENTS;

DISCOUNT RATES; AND INFLATION RATES. ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS INCURRED IN THE CURRENT PERIOD WERE LEVEL 3 (UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS) FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS. THE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THESE LIABILITIES ARE CAPITALIZED AS PART OF THE RELATED ASSETS

AND DEPRECIATED AS THE RESERVES ARE PRODUCED. OVER TIME, THE LIABILITIES ARE ACCRETED FOR THE CHANGE IN THEIR PRESENT VALUE. ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS FOR DOWNSTREAM AND CHEMICAL FACILITIES GENERALLY BECOME FIRM AT THE TIME THE FACILITIES ARE

PERMANENTLY SHUT DOWN AND DISMANTLED. THESE OBLIGATIONS MAY INCLUDE THE COSTS OF ASSET DISPOSAL AND ADDITIONAL SOIL REMEDIATION. HOWEVER, THESE SITES HAVE INDETERMINATE LIVES BASED ON PLANS FOR CONTINUED OPERATIONS AND AS SUCH, THE FAIR VALUE OF THE

CONDITIONAL LEGAL OBLIGATIONS CANNOT BE MEASURED, SINCE IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO ESTIMATE THE FUTURE SETTLEMENT DATES OF SUCH OBLIGATIONS.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS.

THE FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS IS DETERMINED BY REFERENCE TO OBSERVABLE MARKET DATA AND OTHER VALUATION

TECHNIQUES AS APPROPRIATE. THE ONLY CATEGORY OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WHERE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN FAIR VALUE AND RECORDED BOOK VALUE IS NOTABLE IS LONG-TERM DEBT. THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF TOTAL LONG-TERM DEBT, INCLUDING CAPITALIZED LEASE

OBLIGATIONS, WAS $9.8 BILLION AND $12.8 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2011, AND 2010, RESPECTIVELY, AS COMPARED TO RECORDED BOOK VALUES OF $9.3 BILLION AND $12.2 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2011, AND 2010, RESPECTIVELY. THE FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY FOR LONG-TERM

DEBT IS PRIMARILY LEVEL 1 (QUOTED PRICES FOR IDENTICAL ASSETS IN ACTIVE MARKETS).

TABLE OF CONTENTS

INDEX TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS.

THE CORPORATIONS SIZE, STRONG CAPITAL STRUCTURE, GEOGRAPHIC DIVERSITY AND THE

COMPLEMENTARY NATURE OF THE UPSTREAM, DOWNSTREAM AND CHEMICAL BUSINESSES REDUCE THE CORPORATIONS ENTERPRISE-WIDE RISK FROM CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES, CURRENCY RATES AND COMMODITY PRICES. AS A RESULT, THE CORPORATION MAKES LIMITED USE OF

DERIVATIVES TO MITIGATE THE IMPACT OF SUCH CHANGES. THE CORPORATION DOES NOT ENGAGE IN SPECULATIVE DERIVATIVE ACTIVITIES OR DERIVATIVE TRADING ACTIVITIES NOR DOES IT USE DERIVATIVES WITH LEVERAGED FEATURES.

WHEN THE CORPORATION DOES ENTER INTO DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS, IT IS TO OFFSET EXPOSURES ASSOCIATED WITH INTEREST RATES, FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE

RATES AND HYDROCARBON PRICES THAT ARISE FROM EXISTING ASSETS, LIABILITIES AND FORECASTED TRANSACTIONS. THE CASH FLOW HEDGE POSITIONS ACQUIRED AS A RESULT OF THE XTO MERGER WERE SETTLED BY DECEMBER 31, 2011, AND THOSE PROGRAMS HAVE BEEN DISCONTINUED.

THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS OUTSTANDING AND RECORDED ON THE BALANCE SHEET WAS A NET LIABILITY OF $3 MILLION AT

YEAR-END 2011 AND A NET ASSET OF $172 MILLION AT YEAR-END 2010. ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ASSOCIATED WITH DERIVATIVES ARE PREDOMINANTLY RECORDED EITHER IN OTHER CURRENT ASSETS OR ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND ACCRUED LIABILITIES.

THE CORPORATIONS FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT OF ITS DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS USES PRIMARILY LEVEL 2 INPUTS (DERIVATIVES THAT ARE

DETERMINED BY EITHER MARKET PRICES ON AN ACTIVE MARKET FOR SIMILAR ASSETS OR BY PRICES QUOTED BY A BROKER OR OTHER MARKET-CORROBORATED PRICES).

THE CORPORATION RECOGNIZED A BEFORE-TAX GAIN OR (LOSS) RELATED TO DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS OF $131 MILLION, $221 MILLION AND $(73) MILLION DURING 2011, 2010 AND 2009, RESPECTIVELY. INCOME STATEMENT EFFECTS

ASSOCIATED WITH DERIVATIVES ARE RECORDED EITHER IN SALES AND OTHER OPERATING REVENUE OR CRUDE OIL AND PRODUCT PURCHASES. OF THE AMOUNT STATED ABOVE FOR 2011, CASH FLOW HEDGES RESULTED IN A BEFORE-TAX GAIN OF $136 MILLION.

THE CORPORATION BELIEVES THERE ARE NO MATERIAL MARKET OR CREDIT RISKS TO THE CORPORATIONS FINANCIAL POSITION, RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS OR LIQUIDITY AS A RESULT OF THE DERIVATIVE ACTIVITIES DESCRIBED ABOVE.

13. LONG-TERM DEBT

AT DECEMBER 31, 2011, LONG-TERM DEBT CONSISTED OF $8,855 MILLION DUE IN U.S. DOLLARS AND $467 MILLION REPRESENTING THE U.S. DOLLAR

EQUIVALENT AT YEAR-END EXCHANGE RATES OF AMOUNTS PAYABLE IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES. THESE AMOUNTS EXCLUDE THAT PORTION OF LONG-TERM DEBT, TOTALING $3,431 MILLION, WHICH MATURES WITHIN ONE YEAR AND IS INCLUDED IN CURRENT LIABILITIES. THE AMOUNTS OF

LONG-TERM DEBT MATURING, IN EACH OF THE FOUR YEARS AFTER DECEMBER 31, 2012, IN MILLIONS OF DOLLARS, ARE: 2013  $967, 2014  $871, 2015  $606 AND 2016  $503. AT DECEMBER 31, 2011, THE CORPORATIONS

UNUSED LONG-TERM CREDIT LINES WERE NOT MATERIAL.

GRANTED AT PRICES NOT LESS THAN 100 PERCENT OF MARKET VALUE ON THE DATE OF GRANT AND HAVE A MAXIMUM LIFE OF 10 YEARS. THE MAXIMUM NUMBER OF SHARES OF STOCK THAT MAY BE ISSUED UNDER THE 2003 INCENTIVE PROGRAM IS 220 MILLION. AWARDS THAT ARE

FORFEITED, EXPIRE OR ARE SETTLED IN CASH, DO NOT COUNT AGAINST THIS MAXIMUM LIMIT. THE 2003 INCENTIVE PROGRAM DOES NOT HAVE A SPECIFIED TERM. NEW AWARDS MAY BE MADE UNTIL THE AVAILABLE SHARES ARE DEPLETED, UNLESS THE BOARD TERMINATES THE PLAN EARLY.

AT THE END OF 2011, REMAINING SHARES AVAILABLE FOR AWARD UNDER THE 2003 INCENTIVE PROGRAM WERE 133,183 THOUSAND.

GRADED VESTING PERIODS, WITH 50 PERCENT OF THE SHARES IN EACH AWARD VESTING AFTER THREE YEARS AND THE REMAINING 50 PERCENT VESTING AFTER SEVEN YEARS. AWARDS GRANTED TO A SMALL NUMBER OF SENIOR EXECUTIVES HAVE VESTING PERIODS OF FIVE YEARS FOR 50

PERCENT OF THE AWARD AND OF 10 YEARS OR RETIREMENT, WHICHEVER OCCURS LATER, FOR THE REMAINING 50 PERCENT OF THE AWARD.

ADDITIONALLY,

IN 2010 LONG-TERM INCENTIVE AWARDS TOTALING 4,206 THOUSAND SHARES OF RESTRICTED (NONVESTED) COMMON STOCK, WITH A VALUE OF $250 MILLION, WERE GRANTED IN ASSOCIATION WITH THE XTO MERGER. THE MAJORITY OF THESE AWARDS VEST OVER PERIODS OF UP TO THREE

15. LITIGATION AND OTHER CONTINGENCIES

LITIGATION.

A VARIETY OF CLAIMS HAVE BEEN MADE AGAINST EXXONMOBIL AND CERTAIN OF ITS CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES IN A NUMBER OF PENDING

LAWSUITS. MANAGEMENT HAS REGULAR LITIGATION REVIEWS, INCLUDING UPDATES FROM CORPORATE AND OUTSIDE COUNSEL, TO ASSESS THE NEED FOR ACCOUNTING RECOGNITION OR DISCLOSURE OF THESE CONTINGENCIES. THE CORPORATION ACCRUES AN UNDISCOUNTED LIABILITY FOR

THOSE CONTINGENCIES WHERE THE INCURRENCE OF A LOSS IS PROBABLE AND THE AMOUNT CAN BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED. IF A RANGE OF AMOUNTS CAN BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED AND NO AMOUNT WITHIN THE RANGE IS A BETTER ESTIMATE THAN ANY OTHER AMOUNT, THEN THE MINIMUM

OF THE RANGE IS ACCRUED. THE CORPORATION DOES NOT RECORD LIABILITIES WHEN THE LIKELIHOOD THAT THE LIABILITY HAS BEEN INCURRED IS PROBABLE BUT THE AMOUNT CANNOT BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED OR WHEN THE LIABILITY IS BELIEVED TO BE ONLY REASONABLY POSSIBLE

OR REMOTE. FOR CONTINGENCIES WHERE AN UNFAVORABLE OUTCOME IS REASONABLY POSSIBLE AND WHICH ARE SIGNIFICANT, THE CORPORATION DISCLOSES THE NATURE OF THE CONTINGENCY AND, WHERE FEASIBLE, AN ESTIMATE OF THE POSSIBLE LOSS. FOR PURPOSES OF OUR

CONTINGENCY DISCLOSURES, SIGNIFICANT INCLUDES MATERIAL MATTERS AS WELL AS OTHER MATTERS WHICH MANAGEMENT BELIEVES SHOULD BE DISCLOSED. EXXONMOBIL WILL CONTINUE TO DEFEND ITSELF VIGOROUSLY IN THESE MATTERS. BASED ON A CONSIDERATION OF ALL

RELEVANT FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES, THE CORPORATION DOES NOT BELIEVE THE ULTIMATE OUTCOME OF ANY CURRENTLY PENDING LAWSUIT AGAINST EXXONMOBIL WILL HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT UPON THE CORPORATIONS OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, OR FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS TAKEN AS A WHOLE.

ON JUNE 30, 2011, A STATE DISTRICT COURT JURY IN BALTIMORE COUNTY, MARYLAND RETURNED A VERDICT AGAINST

EXXON MOBIL CORPORATION IN

ALLISON, ET AL V. EXXON MOBIL CORPORATION,

A CASE INVOLVING AN ACCIDENTAL 26,000 GALLON GASOLINE LEAK AT A SUBURBAN BALTIMORE SERVICE STATION. THE VERDICT INCLUDED APPROXIMATELY $497 MILLION IN COMPENSATORY DAMAGES

AND APPROXIMATELY $1.0 BILLION IN PUNITIVE DAMAGES IN A FINDING THAT EXXONMOBIL FRAUDULENTLY MISLED THE PLANTIFF-RESIDENTS ABOUT THE EVENTS LEADING UP TO THE LEAK, THE LEAKS DISCOVERY, AND THE NATURE AND EXTENT OF ANY GROUNDWATER

CONTAMINATION. EXXONMOBIL BELIEVES THE VERDICT IS NOT JUSTIFIED BY THE EVIDENCE AND THAT THE AMOUNT OF THE COMPENSATORY AWARD IS GROSSLY EXCESSIVE AND THE IMPOSITION OF PUNITIVE DAMAGES IS IMPROPER AND UNCONSTITUTIONAL. THE TRIAL COURT DENIED A

POST-TRIAL MOTION THAT EXXONMOBIL FILED TO OVERTURN THE PUNITIVE DAMAGES VERDICT. FOLLOWING THE ENTRY OF A FINAL JUDGMENT, EXXONMOBIL WILL APPEAL THE VERDICT AND JUDGMENT. IN A PRIOR TRIAL INVOLVING THE SAME LEAK, THE JURY AWARDED PLANTIFF-RESIDENTS

COMPENSATORY DAMAGES BUT DECIDED AGAINST PUNITIVE DAMAGES. THE PLAINTIFFS DID NOT APPEAL THE JURYS DENIAL OF PUNITIVE DAMAGES. FOLLOWING AN APPEAL BY EXXONMOBIL OF THE COMPENSATORY DAMAGES AWARD, ON FEBRUARY 9, 2012, THE MARYLAND SPECIAL COURT

OF APPEALS REVERSED IN PART AND AFFIRMED IN PART THE TRIAL COURTS DECISION ON COMPENSATORY DAMAGES. THE ULTIMATE OUTCOME OF THIS LITIGATION IS NOT EXPECTED TO HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT UPON THE CORPORATIONS OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL

CONDITION, OR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS TAKEN AS A WHOLE.

OTHER CONTINGENCIES.

THE CORPORATION AND CERTAIN OF ITS CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES WERE

CONTINGENTLY LIABLE AT DECEMBER 31, 2011, FOR GUARANTEES RELATING TO NOTES, LOANS AND PERFORMANCE UNDER CONTRACTS.

IN ACCORDANCE WITH

A NATIONALIZATION DECREE ISSUED BY VENEZUELAS PRESIDENT IN FEBRUARY 2007, BY MAY 1, 2007, A SUBSIDIARY OF THE VENEZUELAN NATIONAL OIL COMPANY (PDVSA) ASSUMED THE OPERATORSHIP OF THE CERRO NEGRO HEAVY OIL PROJECT. THIS PROJECT HAD BEEN OPERATED

AND OWNED BY EXXONMOBIL AFFILIATES HOLDING A 41.67 PERCENT OWNERSHIP INTEREST IN THE PROJECT. THE DECREE ALSO REQUIRED CONVERSION OF THE CERRO NEGRO PROJECT INTO A MIXED ENTERPRISE AND AN INCREASE IN PDVSAS OR ONE OF ITS

INDEX TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

AFFILIATES OWNERSHIP INTEREST IN THE PROJECT, WITH THE STIPULATION THAT IF EXXONMOBIL REFUSED TO ACCEPT THE TERMS FOR THE FORMATION OF THE MIXED ENTERPRISE WITHIN A SPECIFIED PERIOD OF

TIME, THE GOVERNMENT WOULD DIRECTLY ASSUME THE ACTIVITIES CARRIED OUT BY THE JOINT VENTURE. EXXONMOBIL REFUSED TO ACCEDE TO THE TERMS PROFFERED BY THE GOVERNMENT, AND ON JUNE 27, 2007, THE GOVERNMENT EXPROPRIATED EXXONMOBILS 41.67

PERCENT INTEREST IN THE CERRO NEGRO PROJECT. EXXONMOBILS REMAINING NET BOOK INVESTMENT IN CERRO NEGRO PRODUCING ASSETS WAS ABOUT $750 MILLION AT YEAR-END 2011.

ON SEPTEMBER 6, 2007, AFFILIATES OF EXXONMOBIL FILED A REQUEST FOR ARBITRATION WITH THE INTERNATIONAL CENTRE FOR SETTLEMENT OF INVESTMENT DISPUTES (ICSID) INVOKING ICSID JURISDICTION UNDER VENEZUELAS

INVESTMENT LAW AND THE NETHERLANDS-VENEZUELA BILATERAL INVESTMENT TREATY. THE ICSID TRIBUNAL ISSUED A DECISION ON JUNE 10, 2010, FINDING THAT IT HAD JURISDICTION TO PROCEED ON THE BASIS OF THE NETHERLANDS-VENEZUELA BILATERAL INVESTMENT TREATY. THE

ICSID ARBITRATION PROCEEDING IS CONTINUING AND A HEARING ON THE MERITS WAS HELD IN FEBRUARY 2012. AT THIS TIME, THE NET IMPACT OF THESE MATTERS ON THE CORPORATIONS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL RESULTS CANNOT BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED. REGARDLESS, THE

CORPORATION DOES NOT EXPECT THE RESOLUTION TO HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT UPON THE CORPORATIONS OPERATIONS OR FINANCIAL CONDITION.

AN AFFILIATE OF EXXONMOBIL, MOBIL CERRO NEGRO, LTD. (MCN), ALSO FILED AN ARBITRATION UNDER THE RULES OF THE INTERNATIONAL CHAMBER OF COMMERCE

(ICC) AGAINST PDVSA AND A PDVSA AFFILIATE, PDVSA CN, FOR BREACH OF THEIR CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS UNDER CERTAIN CERRO NEGRO PROJECT AGREEMENTS. ON DECEMBER 23, 2011, THE TRIBUNAL RENDERED ITS AWARD WHICH FOUND PDVSA AND PDVSA CN JOINTLY AND SEVERALLY

LIABLE TO MCN IN THE AMOUNT OF ABOUT $908 MILLION. THE TRIBUNAL DEDUCTED APPROXIMATELY $161 MILLION OF UNCONTESTED DEBT OWED BY MCN TO PDVSA AND PDVSA CN, LEAVING A BALANCE OF ABOUT $747 MILLION. POST-AWARD INTEREST ON THIS NET AMOUNT WAS SET AT THE

NEW YORK PRIME RATE COMPOUNDED ANNUALLY AND RUNNING FROM THE DATE OF THE AWARD. THE TRIBUNAL GRANTED PDVSA AND PDVSA CN A SIXTY-DAY GRACE PERIOD IN WHICH TO COMPLY WITH THE AWARD. ON JANUARY 26, 2012, MCN FILED A MOTION TO CONFIRM THE AWARD AGAINST

PDVSA CN. IN RESPONSE TO AN ORDER TO SHOW CAUSE FILED BY PDVSA ON JANUARY 17, 2012, THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK, ON FEBRUARY 1, 2012, ORDERED THE RELEASE TO MCN OF APPROXIMATELY $305 MILLION OF PDVSA CN

FUNDS PREVIOUSLY ATTACHED IN CONNECTION WITH THE ARBITRATION IN PARTIAL SATISFACTION OF THE AWARD. MCN RECEIVED THOSE FUNDS ON FEBRUARY 10, 2012. IN FURTHER SATISFACTION OF THE AWARD, PDVSA CANCELLED APPROXIMATELY $195 MILLION IN MCN BOND DEBT ON

FEBRUARY 13, 2012. PDVSA PAID MCN THE BALANCE OF THE MONETARY PORTION OF THE AWARD ON FEBRUARY 14, 2012.

AN AFFILIATE OF EXXONMOBIL

IS ONE OF THE CONTRACTORS UNDER A PRODUCTION SHARING CONTRACT (PSC) WITH THE NIGERIAN NATIONAL PETROLEUM CORPORATION (NNPC) COVERING THE ERHA BLOCK LOCATED IN THE OFFSHORE WATERS OF NIGERIA. EXXONMOBILS AFFILIATE IS THE OPERATOR OF THE

BLOCK AND OWNS A 56.25 PERCENT INTEREST UNDER THE PSC. THE CONTRACTORS ARE IN DISPUTE WITH NNPC REGARDING NNPCS LIFTING OF CRUDE OIL IN EXCESS OF ITS ENTITLEMENT UNDER THE TERMS OF THE PSC. IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE TERMS OF THE PSC,

THE CONTRACTORS INITIATED ARBITRATION IN ABUJA, NIGERIA, UNDER THE NIGERIAN ARBITRATION AND CONCILIATION ACT. ON OCTOBER 24, 2011, A THREE-MEMBER ARBITRAL TRIBUNAL ISSUED AN AWARD UPHOLDING THE CONTRACTORS POSITION IN ALL MATERIAL

RESPECTS AND AWARDING DAMAGES TO THE CONTRACTORS JOINTLY IN AN AMOUNT OF APPROXIMATELY $1.8 BILLION PLUS $234 MILLION IN ACCRUED INTEREST. THE CONTRACTORS HAVE PETITIONED A NIGERIAN FEDERAL COURT FOR ENFORCEMENT OF THE AWARD, AND NNPC HAS PETITIONED

THE SAME COURT TO HAVE THE AWARD SET ASIDE. THOSE PROCEEDINGS ARE PENDING. AT THIS TIME, THE NET IMPACT OF THIS MATTER ON THE CORPORATIONS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL RESULTS CANNOT BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED. HOWEVER, REGARDLESS OF THE

OUTCOME OF ENFORCEMENT PROCEEDINGS, THE CORPORATION DOES NOT EXPECT THE PROCEEDINGS TO HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT UPON THE CORPORATIONS OPERATIONS OR FINANCIAL CONDITION.

FOR 2011 AND 2010, OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS PAID ARE NET OF $29 MILLION AND $15 MILLION OF MEDICARE SUBSIDY RECEIPTS, RESPECTIVELY.

FOR U.S. PLANS, THE DISCOUNT RATE IS DETERMINED BY CONSTRUCTING A PORTFOLIO OF

HIGH-QUALITY, NONCALLABLE BONDS WITH CASH FLOWS THAT MATCH ESTIMATED OUTFLOWS FOR BENEFIT PAYMENTS. FOR MAJOR NON-U.S. PLANS, THE DISCOUNT RATE IS DETERMINED BY USING BOND PORTFOLIOS WITH AN AVERAGE MATURITY APPROXIMATING THAT OF THE

LIABILITIES OR SPOT YIELD CURVES, BOTH OF WHICH ARE CONSTRUCTED USING HIGH-QUALITY, LOCAL-CURRENCY-DENOMINATED BONDS.

THE

MEASUREMENT OF THE ACCUMULATED POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATION ASSUMES AN INITIAL HEALTH CARE COST TREND RATE OF 5.5 PERCENT THAT DECLINES TO 4.5 PERCENT BY 2015. A ONE-PERCENTAGE-POINT INCREASE IN THE HEALTH CARE COST TREND RATE WOULD

INCREASE SERVICE AND INTEREST COST BY $63 MILLION AND THE POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATION BY $696 MILLION. A ONE-PERCENTAGE-POINT DECREASE IN THE HEALTH CARE COST TREND RATE WOULD DECREASE SERVICE AND INTEREST COST BY $49 MILLION AND THE

POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATION BY $567 MILLION.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

INDEX TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

THE CORPORATIONS INVESTMENT STRATEGY FOR BENEFIT PLAN ASSETS REFLECTS A LONG-TERM VIEW, A

CAREFUL ASSESSMENT OF THE RISKS INHERENT IN VARIOUS ASSET CLASSES AND BROAD DIVERSIFICATION TO REDUCE THE RISK OF THE PORTFOLIO. THE BENEFIT PLAN ASSETS ARE PRIMARILY INVESTED IN PASSIVE EQUITY AND FIXED INCOME INDEX FUNDS TO DIVERSIFY RISK

WHILE MINIMIZING COSTS. THE EQUITY FUNDS HOLD EXXONMOBIL STOCK ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO REPLICATE THE RELEVANT EQUITY INDEX. THE FIXED INCOME FUNDS ARE LARGELY INVESTED IN HIGH-QUALITY CORPORATE AND GOVERNMENT DEBT SECURITIES.

STUDIES ARE PERIODICALLY CONDUCTED TO ESTABLISH THE PREFERRED TARGET ASSET ALLOCATION. THE TARGET ASSET ALLOCATION FOR THE U.S. BENEFIT PLANS IS

50 PERCENT EQUITY SECURITIES AND 50 PERCENT DEBT SECURITIES. THE TARGET ASSET ALLOCATION FOR THE NON-U.S. PLANS IN AGGREGATE IS 47 PERCENT EQUITIES, 50 PERCENT DEBT AND 3 PERCENT REAL ESTATE FUNDS. THE EQUITY TARGETS FOR THE U.S. AND NON-U.S. PLANS

INCLUDE AN ALLOCATION TO PRIVATE EQUITY PARTNERSHIPS THAT PRIMARILY FOCUS ON EARLY-STAGE VENTURE CAPITAL OF 5 PERCENT AND 3 PERCENT, RESPECTIVELY.

THE FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT LEVELS ARE ACCOUNTING TERMS THAT REFER TO DIFFERENT METHODS OF VALUING ASSETS. THE TERMS DO NOT REPRESENT THE RELATIVE RISK OR CREDIT QUALITY OF AN INVESTMENT.

17. DISCLOSURES ABOUT SEGMENTS AND RELATED INFORMATION

THE UPSTREAM, DOWNSTREAM AND CHEMICAL FUNCTIONS BEST DEFINE THE OPERATING SEGMENTS OF THE BUSINESS THAT ARE REPORTED SEPARATELY. THE FACTORS

USED TO IDENTIFY THESE REPORTABLE SEGMENTS ARE BASED ON THE NATURE OF THE OPERATIONS THAT ARE UNDERTAKEN BY EACH SEGMENT. THE UPSTREAM SEGMENT IS ORGANIZED AND OPERATES TO EXPLORE FOR AND PRODUCE CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS. THE DOWNSTREAM SEGMENT IS

ORGANIZED AND OPERATES TO MANUFACTURE AND SELL PETROLEUM PRODUCTS. THE CHEMICAL SEGMENT IS ORGANIZED AND OPERATES TO MANUFACTURE AND SELL PETROCHEMICALS. THESE SEGMENTS ARE BROADLY UNDERSTOOD ACROSS THE PETROLEUM AND PETROCHEMICAL INDUSTRIES.

THESE FUNCTIONS HAVE BEEN DEFINED AS THE OPERATING SEGMENTS OF THE CORPORATION BECAUSE THEY ARE THE SEGMENTS (1) THAT ENGAGE IN

BUSINESS ACTIVITIES FROM WHICH REVENUES ARE EARNED AND EXPENSES ARE INCURRED; (2) WHOSE OPERATING RESULTS ARE REGULARLY REVIEWED BY THE CORPORATIONS CHIEF OPERATING DECISION MAKER TO MAKE DECISIONS ABOUT RESOURCES TO BE ALLOCATED TO THE

SEGMENT AND ASSESS ITS PERFORMANCE; AND (3) FOR WHICH DISCRETE FINANCIAL INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE.

EARNINGS AFTER INCOME TAX

INCLUDE SPECIAL ITEMS, AND TRANSFERS ARE AT ESTIMATED MARKET PRICES. EARNINGS FOR 2009 INCLUDED A SPECIAL CHARGE OF $140 MILLION IN THE CORPORATE AND FINANCING SEGMENT FOR INTEREST RELATED TO THE VALDEZ PUNITIVE DAMAGES AWARD.

INTEREST EXPENSE INCLUDES NON-DEBT-RELATED INTEREST EXPENSE OF $165 MILLION, $41 MILLION AND $500 MILLION IN 2011, 2010 AND 2009, RESPECTIVELY.

HIGHER EXPENSES IN 2009 PRIMARILY REFLECT INTEREST PROVISIONS RELATED TO THE VALDEZ LITIGATION.

IN CORPORATE AND FINANCING

ACTIVITIES, INTEREST REVENUE RELATES TO INTEREST EARNED ON CASH DEPOSITS AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES.

THE CORPORATION HAD $47 BILLION OF INDEFINITELY REINVESTED, UNDISTRIBUTED EARNINGS FROM SUBSIDIARY COMPANIES OUTSIDE THE

U.S. UNRECOGNIZED DEFERRED TAXES ON REMITTANCE OF THESE FUNDS ARE NOT EXPECTED TO BE MATERIAL.

UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS

THE CORPORATION IS SUBJECT TO INCOME TAXATION IN MANY JURISDICTIONS AROUND THE WORLD. UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS REFLECT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN POSITIONS TAKEN OR

EXPECTED TO BE TAKEN ON INCOME TAX RETURNS AND THE AMOUNTS RECOGNIZED IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. RESOLUTION OF THE RELATED TAX POSITIONS THROUGH NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE RELEVANT TAX AUTHORITIES OR THROUGH LITIGATION WILL TAKE MANY YEARS TO COMPLETE.

IT IS DIFFICULT TO PREDICT THE TIMING OF RESOLUTION FOR TAX POSITIONS SINCE SUCH TIMING IS NOT ENTIRELY WITHIN THE CONTROL OF THE CORPORATION. IT IS REASONABLY POSSIBLE THAT THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS COULD INCREASE BY UP TO

50 PERCENT IN THE NEXT 12 MONTHS, WITH NO MATERIAL IMPACT ON NEAR-TERM EARNINGS. GIVEN THE LONG TIME PERIODS INVOLVED IN RESOLVING TAX POSITIONS, THE CORPORATION DOES NOT EXPECT THAT THE RECOGNITION OF UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS WILL HAVE A

MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE CORPORATIONS EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE IN ANY GIVEN YEAR.

PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT WERE MEASURED PRIMARILY USING AN INCOME APPROACH. THE FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS OF THE OIL AND GAS ASSETS WERE BASED, IN PART, ON SIGNIFICANT

INPUTS NOT OBSERVABLE IN THE MARKET AND THUS REPRESENT A LEVEL 3 MEASUREMENT. THE SIGNIFICANT INPUTS INCLUDED XTO RESOURCES, ASSUMED FUTURE PRODUCTION PROFILES, COMMODITY PRICES (MAINLY BASED ON OBSERVABLE MARKET INPUTS), RISK ADJUSTED DISCOUNT RATE

OF 7 PERCENT, INFLATION OF 2 PERCENT AND ASSUMPTIONS ON THE TIMING AND AMOUNT OF FUTURE DEVELOPMENT AND OPERATING COSTS. THE PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT ADDITIONS WERE SEGMENTED TO THE UPSTREAM BUSINESS, WITH SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE ASSETS IN THE

UNITED STATES.

(2)

GOODWILL WAS THE EXCESS OF THE CONSIDERATION TRANSFERRED OVER THE NET ASSETS RECOGNIZED AND REPRESENTS THE FUTURE ECONOMIC BENEFITS ARISING FROM OTHER ASSETS ACQUIRED THAT

COULD NOT BE INDIVIDUALLY IDENTIFIED AND SEPARATELY RECOGNIZED. GOODWILL WAS RECOGNIZED IN THE UPSTREAM REPORTING UNIT. GOODWILL IS NOT AMORTIZED AND IS NOT DEDUCTIBLE FOR TAX PURPOSES.

(3)

LONG-TERM DEBT WAS RECOGNIZED AT MARKET RATES AT CLOSING (LEVEL 1).

(4)

DEFERRED INCOME TAXES REFLECT THE TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE AMOUNT OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES RECOGNIZED FOR FINANCIAL REPORTING PURPOSES AND SUCH AMOUNTS RECOGNIZED

FOR TAX PURPOSES.

THE 2010 UNAUDITED PRO FORMA REVENUES OF $373 BILLION, NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO EXXONMOBIL OF $31 BILLION,

EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE OF $6.03 AND EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE ASSUMING DILUTION OF $6.01 FOR THE CORPORATION WERE CALCULATED AS IF THE MERGER OF XTO HAD OCCURRED AT THE BEGINNING OF 2010. THE HISTORICAL FINANCIAL INFORMATION WAS ADJUSTED TO GIVE

EFFECT TO THE PRO FORMA EVENTS THAT WERE DIRECTLY ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE MERGER AND FACTUALLY SUPPORTABLE. THE UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONSOLIDATED RESULTS ARE NOT NECESSARILY INDICATIVE OF WHAT THE CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS ACTUALLY WOULD HAVE

BEEN HAD THE MERGER BEEN COMPLETED ON JANUARY 1, 2010. IN ADDITION, THE UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONSOLIDATED RESULTS DO NOT PURPORT TO PROJECT THE FUTURE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OF THE COMBINED COMPANY. THE UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONSOLIDATED RESULTS REFLECT

PRO FORMA ADJUSTMENTS FOR THE ELIMINATION OF DEFERRED GAINS AND LOSSES RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS FOR DERIVATIVES OUTSTANDING AT THE BEGINNING OF THE YEAR, DEPRECIATION EXPENSE RELATED TO THE FAIR VALUE ADJUSTMENT TO PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT

ACQUIRED, ADDITIONAL AMORTIZATION EXPENSE RELATED TO THE FAIR VALUE OF IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS ACQUIRED, CAPITALIZATION OF INTEREST EXPENSE AND APPLICABLE INCOME TAX IMPACTS.

OIL AND GAS EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION COSTS

THE AMOUNTS SHOWN FOR NET CAPITALIZED COSTS OF CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES ARE $6,651 MILLION LESS AT YEAR-END 2011 AND $4,729 MILLION LESS AT YEAR-END 2010 THAN THE AMOUNTS REPORTED AS INVESTMENTS IN PROPERTY,

PLANT AND EQUIPMENT FOR THE UPSTREAM IN NOTE 8. THIS IS DUE TO THE EXCLUSION FROM CAPITALIZED COSTS OF CERTAIN TRANSPORTATION AND RESEARCH ASSETS AND ASSETS RELATING TO LNG OPERATIONS. ASSETS RELATED TO OIL SANDS AND OIL SHALE MINING

OPERATIONS HAVE BEEN INCLUDED IN THE CAPITALIZED COSTS FOR 2011 AND 2010 IN ACCORDANCE WITH FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD RULES.

INDEX TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

OIL AND GAS RESERVES

THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION DESCRIBES CHANGES DURING THE YEARS AND BALANCES OF PROVED OIL AND GAS RESERVES AT YEAR-END 2009, 2010, AND 2011.

THE DEFINITIONS USED ARE IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSIONS RULE 4-10 (A) OF REGULATION S-X.

PROVED OIL AND GAS RESERVES ARE THOSE QUANTITIES OF OIL AND GAS, WHICH, BY ANALYSIS OF GEOSCIENCE AND ENGINEERING DATA, CAN BE ESTIMATED WITH REASONABLE CERTAINTY TO BE ECONOMICALLY PRODUCIBLE  FROM A

GIVEN DATE FORWARD, FROM KNOWN RESERVOIRS, AND UNDER EXISTING ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, OPERATING METHODS AND GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS  PRIOR TO THE TIME AT WHICH CONTRACTS PROVIDING THE RIGHT TO OPERATE EXPIRE, UNLESS EVIDENCE INDICATES THAT RENEWAL

IS REASONABLY CERTAIN. IN SOME CASES, SUBSTANTIAL NEW INVESTMENTS IN ADDITIONAL WELLS AND RELATED FACILITIES WILL BE REQUIRED TO RECOVER THESE PROVED RESERVES.

IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSIONS RULES, THE YEAR-END RESERVES VOLUMES AS WELL AS THE RESERVES CHANGE CATEGORIES SHOWN IN THE FOLLOWING TABLES WERE CALCULATED USING AVERAGE PRICES

DURING THE 12-MONTH PERIOD PRIOR TO THE ENDING DATE OF THE PERIOD COVERED BY THE REPORT, DETERMINED AS AN UNWEIGHTED ARITHMETIC AVERAGE OF THE FIRST-DAY-OF-THE-MONTH PRICE FOR EACH MONTH WITHIN SUCH PERIOD. THESE RESERVES QUANTITIES ARE ALSO USED IN

CALCULATING UNIT-OF-PRODUCTION DEPRECIATION RATES AND IN CALCULATING THE STANDARDIZED MEASURE OF DISCOUNTED NET CASH FLOW.

REVISIONS

CAN INCLUDE UPWARD OR DOWNWARD CHANGES IN PREVIOUSLY ESTIMATED VOLUMES OF PROVED RESERVES FOR EXISTING FIELDS DUE TO THE EVALUATION OR RE-EVALUATION OF (1) ALREADY AVAILABLE GEOLOGIC, RESERVOIR OR PRODUCTION DATA, (2) NEW GEOLOGIC,

RESERVOIR OR PRODUCTION DATA OR (3) CHANGES IN AVERAGE PRICES AND YEAR-END COSTS THAT ARE USED IN THE ESTIMATION OF RESERVES. THIS CATEGORY CAN ALSO INCLUDE SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN EITHER DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY OR PRODUCTION EQUIPMENT/FACILITY

CAPACITY.

PROVED RESERVES INCLUDE 100 PERCENT OF EACH MAJORITY-OWNED AFFILIATES PARTICIPATION IN PROVED RESERVES AND

EXXONMOBILS OWNERSHIP PERCENTAGE OF THE PROVED RESERVES OF EQUITY COMPANIES, BUT EXCLUDE ROYALTIES AND QUANTITIES DUE OTHERS. GAS RESERVES EXCLUDE THE GASEOUS EQUIVALENT OF LIQUIDS EXPECTED TO BE REMOVED FROM THE GAS ON LEASES, AT FIELD

FACILITIES AND AT GAS PROCESSING PLANTS. THESE LIQUIDS ARE INCLUDED IN NET PROVED RESERVES OF CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS LIQUIDS.

IN

THE PROVED RESERVES TABLES, CONSOLIDATED RESERVES AND EQUITY COMPANY RESERVES ARE REPORTED SEPARATELY. HOWEVER, THE CORPORATION DOES NOT VIEW EQUITY COMPANY RESERVES ANY DIFFERENTLY THAN THOSE FROM CONSOLIDATED COMPANIES.

RESERVES REPORTED UNDER PRODUCTION SHARING AND OTHER NONCONCESSIONARY AGREEMENTS ARE BASED ON THE ECONOMIC INTEREST AS DEFINED BY THE SPECIFIC

FISCAL TERMS IN THE AGREEMENT. THE PRODUCTION AND RESERVES THAT WE REPORT FOR THESE TYPES OF ARRANGEMENTS TYPICALLY VARY INVERSELY WITH OIL AND GAS PRICE CHANGES. AS OIL AND GAS PRICES INCREASE, THE CASH FLOW AND VALUE RECEIVED BY THE COMPANY

INCREASE; HOWEVER, THE PRODUCTION VOLUMES AND RESERVES REQUIRED TO ACHIEVE THIS VALUE WILL TYPICALLY BE LOWER BECAUSE OF THE HIGHER PRICES. WHEN PRICES DECREASE, THE OPPOSITE EFFECT GENERALLY OCCURS. THE PERCENTAGE OF TOTAL LIQUIDS AND NATURAL GAS

PROVED RESERVES (CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES PLUS EQUITY COMPANIES) AT YEAR-END 2011 THAT WERE ASSOCIATED WITH PRODUCTION SHARING CONTRACT ARRANGEMENTS WAS 14 PERCENT OF LIQUIDS, 9 PERCENT OF NATURAL GAS AND 11 PERCENT ON AN OIL-EQUIVALENT BASIS (GAS

CONVERTED TO OIL-EQUIVALENT AT 6 BILLION CUBIC FEET = 1 MILLION BARRELS).

NET PROVED DEVELOPED RESERVES ARE THOSE VOLUMES THAT

ARE EXPECTED TO BE RECOVERED THROUGH EXISTING WELLS WITH EXISTING EQUIPMENT AND OPERATING METHODS OR IN WHICH THE COST OF THE REQUIRED EQUIPMENT IS RELATIVELY MINOR COMPARED TO THE COST OF A NEW WELL. NET PROVED UNDEVELOPED RESERVES ARE THOSE

VOLUMES THAT ARE EXPECTED TO BE RECOVERED FROM NEW WELLS ON UNDRILLED ACREAGE, OR FROM EXISTING WELLS WHERE A RELATIVELY MAJOR EXPENDITURE IS REQUIRED FOR RECOMPLETION.

CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS LIQUIDS AND NATURAL GAS PRODUCTION QUANTITIES SHOWN ARE THE NET VOLUMES WITHDRAWN FROM EXXONMOBILS OIL AND GAS RESERVES. THE NATURAL GAS QUANTITIES DIFFER FROM THE QUANTITIES OF

GAS DELIVERED FOR SALE BY THE PRODUCING FUNCTION AS REPORTED IN THE OPERATING SUMMARY DUE TO VOLUMES CONSUMED OR FLARED AND INVENTORY CHANGES.

IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSIONS RULES, BITUMEN EXTRACTED THROUGH MINING ACTIVITIES AND HYDROCARBONS FROM OTHER NON-TRADITIONAL RESOURCES ARE REPORTED AS OIL AND GAS RESERVES

BEGINNING IN 2009.

THE RULES IN 2009 ADOPTED A RELIABLE TECHNOLOGY DEFINITION THAT PERMITS RESERVES TO BE ADDED BASED ON TECHNOLOGIES

THAT HAVE BEEN FIELD TESTED AND HAVE BEEN DEMONSTRATED TO PROVIDE REASONABLY CERTAIN RESULTS WITH CONSISTENCY AND REPEATABILITY IN THE FORMATION BEING EVALUATED.

THE CHANGES BETWEEN 2010 YEAR-END PROVED RESERVES AND 2011 YEAR-END PROVED RESERVES REFLECT THE INITIAL BOOKING OF THE KEARL EXPANSION PROJECT IN CANADA.

STANDARDIZED MEASURE OF DISCOUNTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS

AS REQUIRED BY THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD, THE STANDARDIZED MEASURE OF

DISCOUNTED FUTURE NET CASH FLOWS IS COMPUTED BY APPLYING FIRST-DAY-OF-THE-MONTH AVERAGE PRICES, YEAR-END COSTS AND LEGISLATED TAX RATES AND A DISCOUNT FACTOR OF 10 PERCENT TO NET PROVED RESERVES. THE STANDARDIZED MEASURE INCLUDES COSTS FOR

FUTURE DISMANTLEMENT, ABANDONMENT AND REHABILITATION OBLIGATIONS. THE CORPORATION BELIEVES THE STANDARDIZED MEASURE DOES NOT PROVIDE A RELIABLE ESTIMATE OF THE CORPORATIONS EXPECTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS TO BE OBTAINED FROM THE

DEVELOPMENT AND PRODUCTION OF ITS OIL AND GAS PROPERTIES OR OF THE VALUE OF ITS PROVED OIL AND GAS RESERVES. THE STANDARDIZED MEASURE IS PREPARED ON THE BASIS OF CERTAIN PRESCRIBED ASSUMPTIONS INCLUDING FIRST-DAY-OF-THE-MONTH AVERAGE PRICES, WHICH

REPRESENT DISCRETE POINTS IN TIME AND THEREFORE MAY CAUSE SIGNIFICANT VARIABILITY IN CASH FLOWS FROM YEAR TO YEAR AS PRICES CHANGE.
