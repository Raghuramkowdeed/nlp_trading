ITEM 1.       BUSINESS

EXXON MOBIL CORPORATION WAS INCORPORATED IN THE STATE OF

NEW JERSEY IN 1882. DIVISIONS AND AFFILIATED COMPANIES OF EXXONMOBIL OPERATE OR

MARKET PRODUCTS IN THE UNITED STATES AND MOST OTHER COUNTRIES OF THE WORLD.

THEIR PRINCIPAL BUSINESS IS ENERGY, INVOLVING EXPLORATION FOR, AND PRODUCTION

OF, CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS, MANUFACTURE OF PETROLEUM PRODUCTS AND

TRANSPORTATION AND SALE OF CRUDE OIL, NATURAL GAS AND PETROLEUM PRODUCTS.

EXXONMOBIL IS A MAJOR MANUFACTURER AND MARKETER OF COMMODITY PETROCHEMICALS, INCLUDING

OLEFINS, AROMATICS, POLYETHYLENE AND POLYPROPYLENE PLASTICS AND A WIDE VARIETY OF

SPECIALTY PRODUCTS. AFFILIATES OF EXXONMOBIL CONDUCT EXTENSIVE RESEARCH

PROGRAMS IN SUPPORT OF THESE BUSINESSES.

EXXON MOBIL CORPORATION HAS SEVERAL DIVISIONS AND HUNDREDS

OF AFFILIATES, MANY WITH NAMES THAT INCLUDE

EXXONMOBIL

,

EXXON

,

ESSO,

MOBIL

OR

XTO

. FOR CONVENIENCE AND SIMPLICITY, IN THIS REPORT THE

TERMS

EXXONMOBIL, EXXON, ESSO, MOBIL

AND

XTO

, AS WELL AS TERMS

LIKE

CORPORATION

,

COMPANY

,

OUR

,

WE

AND

ITS

,

ARE SOMETIMES USED AS ABBREVIATED REFERENCES TO SPECIFIC AFFILIATES OR GROUPS

OF AFFILIATES. THE PRECISE MEANING DEPENDS ON THE CONTEXT IN QUESTION.

THROUGHOUT EXXONMOBIL’S BUSINESSES, NEW AND ONGOING

MEASURES ARE TAKEN TO PREVENT AND MINIMIZE THE IMPACT OF OUR OPERATIONS ON

AIR, WATER AND GROUND. THESE INCLUDE A SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT IN REFINING

INFRASTRUCTURE AND TECHNOLOGY TO MANUFACTURE CLEAN FUELS, AS WELL

AS PROJECTS TO MONITOR AND REDUCE NITROGEN OXIDE, SULFUR OXIDE AND

GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS, AND EXPENDITURES FOR ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS.

USING DEFINITIONS AND GUIDELINES ESTABLISHED BY THE AMERICAN PETROLEUM

INSTITUTE, EXXONMOBIL’S 2016 WORLDWIDE ENVIRONMENTAL EXPENDITURES FOR ALL SUCH

PREVENTATIVE AND REMEDIATION STEPS, INCLUDING EXXONMOBIL’S SHARE OF EQUITY

COMPANY EXPENDITURES, WERE $4.9 BILLION, OF WHICH $3.5 BILLION WERE

INCLUDED IN EXPENSES WITH THE REMAINDER IN CAPITAL EXPENDITURES. THE TOTAL COST

FOR SUCH ACTIVITIES IS EXPECTED TO REMAIN RELATIVELY FLAT AT APPROXIMATELY

$5 BILLION IN 2017 AND 2018. CAPITAL EXPENDITURES ARE EXPECTED TO ACCOUNT

FOR APPROXIMATELY 30 PERCENT OF THE TOTAL.

THE ENERGY AND PETROCHEMICAL INDUSTRIES ARE HIGHLY

COMPETITIVE. THERE IS COMPETITION WITHIN THE INDUSTRIES AND ALSO WITH OTHER

INDUSTRIES IN SUPPLYING THE ENERGY, FUEL AND CHEMICAL NEEDS OF BOTH INDUSTRIAL

AND INDIVIDUAL CONSUMERS. THE CORPORATION COMPETES WITH OTHER FIRMS IN THE SALE

OR PURCHASE OF NEEDED GOODS AND SERVICES IN MANY NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL

MARKETS AND EMPLOYS ALL METHODS OF COMPETITION WHICH ARE LAWFUL AND APPROPRIATE

FOR SUCH PURPOSES.

OPERATING DATA AND INDUSTRY SEGMENT INFORMATION FOR THE

CORPORATION ARE CONTAINED IN THE FINANCIAL SECTION OF THIS REPORT UNDER THE

FOLLOWING: “QUARTERLY INFORMATION”, “NOTE 18: DISCLOSURES ABOUT SEGMENTS

AND RELATED INFORMATION” AND “OPERATING INFORMATION”. INFORMATION ON OIL AND

GAS RESERVES IS CONTAINED IN THE “OIL AND GAS RESERVES” PART OF THE

“SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION ON OIL AND GAS EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION ACTIVITIES”

PORTION OF THE FINANCIAL SECTION OF THIS REPORT.

EXXONMOBIL HAS A LONG‐STANDING COMMITMENT TO THE

DEVELOPMENT OF PROPRIETARY TECHNOLOGY. WE HAVE A WIDE ARRAY OF RESEARCH

PROGRAMS DESIGNED TO MEET THE NEEDS IDENTIFIED IN EACH OF OUR BUSINESS SEGMENTS.

INFORMATION ON COMPANY‐SPONSORED RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT SPENDING IS

CONTAINED IN “NOTE 3: MISCELLANEOUS FINANCIAL INFORMATION” OF THE

FINANCIAL SECTION OF THIS REPORT. EXXONMOBIL HELD NEARLY 12 THOUSAND

ACTIVE PATENTS WORLDWIDE AT THE END OF 2016. FOR TECHNOLOGY LICENSED TO THIRD

PARTIES, REVENUES TOTALED APPROXIMATELY $104 MILLION IN 2016. ALTHOUGH

TECHNOLOGY IS AN IMPORTANT CONTRIBUTOR TO THE OVERALL OPERATIONS AND RESULTS OF

OUR COMPANY, THE PROFITABILITY OF EACH BUSINESS SEGMENT IS NOT DEPENDENT ON ANY

INDIVIDUAL PATENT, TRADE SECRET, TRADEMARK, LICENSE, FRANCHISE OR CONCESSION.

THE NUMBER OF REGULAR EMPLOYEES WAS 71.1 THOUSAND,

73.5 THOUSAND, AND 75.3 THOUSAND AT YEARS ENDED 2016, 2015 AND 2014,

RESPECTIVELY. REGULAR EMPLOYEES ARE DEFINED AS ACTIVE EXECUTIVE, MANAGEMENT,

PROFESSIONAL, TECHNICAL AND WAGE EMPLOYEES WHO WORK FULL TIME OR PART TIME FOR

THE CORPORATION AND ARE COVERED BY THE CORPORATION’S BENEFIT PLANS AND

PROGRAMS. REGULAR EMPLOYEES DO NOT INCLUDE EMPLOYEES OF THE COMPANY‐OPERATED

RETAIL SITES (CORS). THE NUMBER OF CORS EMPLOYEES WAS 1.6 THOUSAND,

2.1 THOUSAND, AND 8.4 THOUSAND AT YEARS ENDED 2016, 2015 AND 2014,

RESPECTIVELY. THE DECREASE IN CORS EMPLOYEES REFLECTS THE MULTI‐YEAR

TRANSITION OF THE COMPANY‐OPERATED RETAIL NETWORK TO A MORE CAPITAL‐EFFICIENT

BRANDED WHOLESALER MODEL.

INFORMATION CONCERNING THE SOURCE AND AVAILABILITY OF RAW

MATERIALS USED IN THE CORPORATION’S BUSINESS, THE EXTENT OF SEASONALITY IN THE

BUSINESS, THE POSSIBILITY OF RENEGOTIATION OF PROFITS OR TERMINATION OF

CONTRACTS AT THE ELECTION OF GOVERNMENTS AND RISKS ATTENDANT TO FOREIGN OPERATIONS

1

ITEM 1A.       RISK FACTORS

EXXONMOBIL’S FINANCIAL AND OPERATING

RESULTS ARE SUBJECT TO A VARIETY OF RISKS INHERENT IN THE GLOBAL OIL, GAS, AND

PETROCHEMICAL BUSINESSES. MANY OF THESE RISK FACTORS ARE NOT WITHIN THE

COMPANY’S CONTROL AND COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, OUR FINANCIAL AND

OPERATING RESULTS, OR OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION. THESE RISK FACTORS INCLUDE.

SUPPLY AND DEMAND

THE OIL, GAS, AND PETROCHEMICAL BUSINESSES ARE

FUNDAMENTALLY COMMODITY BUSINESSES. THIS MEANS EXXONMOBIL’S OPERATIONS AND

EARNINGS MAY BE SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTED BY CHANGES IN OIL, GAS, AND

PETROCHEMICAL PRICES AND BY CHANGES IN MARGINS ON REFINED PRODUCTS. OIL, GAS,

PETROCHEMICAL, AND PRODUCT PRICES AND MARGINS IN TURN DEPEND ON LOCAL, REGIONAL,

AND GLOBAL EVENTS OR CONDITIONS THAT AFFECT SUPPLY AND DEMAND FOR THE RELEVANT

COMMODITY. ANY MATERIAL DECLINE IN OIL OR NATURAL GAS PRICES COULD HAVE A

MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON CERTAIN OF THE COMPANY’S OPERATIONS, ESPECIALLY IN

THE UPSTREAM SEGMENT, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND PROVED RESERVES. ON THE OTHER

HAND, A MATERIAL INCREASE IN OIL OR NATURAL GAS PRICES COULD HAVE A MATERIAL

ADVERSE EFFECT ON CERTAIN OF THE COMPANY’S OPERATIONS, ESPECIALLY IN THE

DOWNSTREAM AND CHEMICAL SEGMENTS.

ECONOMIC CONDITIONS.

THE DEMAND FOR ENERGY AND PETROCHEMICALS CORRELATES CLOSELY WITH

GENERAL ECONOMIC GROWTH RATES. THE OCCURRENCE OF RECESSIONS OR OTHER PERIODS OF

LOW OR NEGATIVE ECONOMIC GROWTH WILL TYPICALLY HAVE A DIRECT ADVERSE IMPACT ON

OUR RESULTS. OTHER FACTORS THAT AFFECT GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS IN THE WORLD

OR IN A MAJOR REGION, SUCH AS CHANGES IN POPULATION GROWTH RATES, PERIODS OF

CIVIL UNREST, GOVERNMENT AUSTERITY PROGRAMS, OR CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE

FLUCTUATIONS, CAN ALSO IMPACT THE DEMAND FOR ENERGY AND PETROCHEMICALS.

SOVEREIGN DEBT DOWNGRADES, DEFAULTS, INABILITY TO ACCESS DEBT MARKETS DUE TO

CREDIT OR LEGAL CONSTRAINTS, LIQUIDITY CRISES, THE BREAKUP OR RESTRUCTURING OF

FISCAL, MONETARY, OR POLITICAL SYSTEMS SUCH AS THE EUROPEAN UNION, AND OTHER

EVENTS OR CONDITIONS THAT IMPAIR THE FUNCTIONING OF FINANCIAL MARKETS AND

INSTITUTIONS ALSO POSE RISKS TO EXXONMOBIL, INCLUDING RISKS TO THE SAFETY OF

OUR FINANCIAL ASSETS AND TO THE ABILITY OF OUR PARTNERS AND CUSTOMERS TO

FULFILL THEIR COMMITMENTS TO EXXONMOBIL.

OTHER DEMAND-RELATED FACTORS.

OTHER FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT THE DEMAND FOR OIL, GAS,

AND PETROCHEMICALS, AND THEREFORE IMPACT OUR RESULTS, INCLUDE TECHNOLOGICAL

IMPROVEMENTS IN ENERGY EFFICIENCY; SEASONAL WEATHER PATTERNS, WHICH AFFECT THE

DEMAND FOR ENERGY ASSOCIATED WITH HEATING AND COOLING; INCREASED COMPETITIVENESS

OF ALTERNATIVE ENERGY SOURCES THAT HAVE SO FAR GENERALLY NOT BEEN COMPETITIVE

WITH OIL AND GAS WITHOUT THE BENEFIT OF GOVERNMENT SUBSIDIES OR MANDATES; AND

CHANGES IN TECHNOLOGY OR CONSUMER PREFERENCES THAT ALTER FUEL CHOICES, SUCH AS

TOWARD ALTERNATIVE FUELED OR ELECTRIC VEHICLES.

OTHER SUPPLY-RELATED FACTORS.

COMMODITY PRICES AND MARGINS ALSO VARY DEPENDING ON A

NUMBER OF FACTORS AFFECTING SUPPLY. FOR EXAMPLE, INCREASED SUPPLY FROM THE

DEVELOPMENT OF NEW OIL AND GAS SUPPLY SOURCES AND TECHNOLOGIES TO ENHANCE

RECOVERY FROM EXISTING SOURCES TEND TO REDUCE COMMODITY PRICES TO THE EXTENT

SUCH SUPPLY INCREASES ARE NOT OFFSET BY COMMENSURATE GROWTH IN DEMAND.

SIMILARLY, INCREASES IN INDUSTRY REFINING OR PETROCHEMICAL MANUFACTURING

CAPACITY TEND TO REDUCE MARGINS ON THE AFFECTED PRODUCTS. WORLD OIL, GAS, AND

PETROCHEMICAL SUPPLY LEVELS CAN ALSO BE AFFECTED BY FACTORS THAT REDUCE

AVAILABLE SUPPLIES, SUCH AS ADHERENCE BY MEMBER COUNTRIES TO OPEC PRODUCTION

QUOTAS AND THE OCCURRENCE OF WARS, HOSTILE ACTIONS, NATURAL DISASTERS,

DISRUPTIONS IN COMPETITORS’ OPERATIONS, OR UNEXPECTED UNAVAILABILITY OF

DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS THAT MAY DISRUPT SUPPLIES. TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE CAN ALSO

ALTER THE RELATIVE COSTS FOR COMPETITORS TO FIND, PRODUCE, AND REFINE OIL AND

GAS AND TO MANUFACTURE PETROCHEMICALS.

OTHER MARKET FACTORS.

EXXONMOBIL’S BUSINESS RESULTS ARE ALSO EXPOSED TO

POTENTIAL NEGATIVE IMPACTS DUE TO CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES, INFLATION,

CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES, AND OTHER LOCAL OR REGIONAL MARKET CONDITIONS. WE

GENERALLY DO NOT USE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS TO HEDGE MARKET EXPOSURES.

GOVERNMENT AND POLITICAL FACTORS

EXXONMOBIL’S RESULTS CAN BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY

POLITICAL OR REGULATORY DEVELOPMENTS AFFECTING OUR OPERATIONS.

ACCESS LIMITATIONS.

A NUMBER OF COUNTRIES LIMIT ACCESS TO THEIR OIL AND GAS RESOURCES, OR

MAY PLACE RESOURCES OFF-LIMITS FROM DEVELOPMENT ALTOGETHER. RESTRICTIONS ON

FOREIGN INVESTMENT IN THE OIL AND GAS SECTOR TEND TO INCREASE IN TIMES OF HIGH

COMMODITY PRICES, WHEN NATIONAL GOVERNMENTS MAY HAVE LESS NEED OF OUTSIDE

SOURCES OF PRIVATE CAPITAL. MANY COUNTRIES ALSO RESTRICT THE IMPORT OR EXPORT

OF CERTAIN PRODUCTS BASED ON POINT OF ORIGIN.

RESTRICTIONS ON DOING BUSINESS.

EXXONMOBIL IS SUBJECT TO LAWS AND SANCTIONS IMPOSED

BY THE U.S. OR BY OTHER JURISDICTIONS WHERE WE DO BUSINESS THAT MAY PROHIBIT

EXXONMOBIL OR CERTAIN OF ITS AFFILIATES FROM DOING BUSINESS IN CERTAIN

COUNTRIES, OR RESTRICTING THE KIND OF BUSINESS THAT MAY BE CONDUCTED. SUCH

RESTRICTIONS MAY PROVIDE A COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE TO COMPETITORS WHO MAY NOT BE

SUBJECT TO COMPARABLE RESTRICTIONS.

LACK OF LEGAL CERTAINTY.

SOME COUNTRIES IN WHICH WE DO BUSINESS LACK

WELL-DEVELOPED LEGAL SYSTEMS, OR HAVE NOT YET ADOPTED CLEAR REGULATORY

FRAMEWORKS FOR OIL AND GAS DEVELOPMENT. LACK OF LEGAL CERTAINTY EXPOSES OUR

OPERATIONS TO INCREASED RISK OF ADVERSE OR UNPREDICTABLE ACTIONS BY GOVERNMENT

OFFICIALS, AND ALSO MAKES IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR US TO ENFORCE OUR CONTRACTS. IN

SOME CASES THESE RISKS CAN BE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AGREEMENTS TO ARBITRATE

DISPUTES IN AN INTERNATIONAL FORUM, BUT THE ADEQUACY OF THIS REMEDY MAY STILL

DEPEND ON THE LOCAL LEGAL SYSTEM TO ENFORCE AN AWARD.

2

REGULATORY AND LITIGATION RISKS.

EVEN IN COUNTRIES WITH WELL-DEVELOPED LEGAL

SYSTEMS WHERE EXXONMOBIL DOES BUSINESS, WE REMAIN EXPOSED TO CHANGES IN LAW

(INCLUDING CHANGES THAT RESULT FROM INTERNATIONAL TREATIES AND ACCORDS) THAT

COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS, SUCH AS.

·

INCREASES IN TAXES, DUTIES, OR GOVERNMENT ROYALTY

RATES (INCLUDING RETROACTIVE CLAIMS);

·

PRICE CONTROLS;

·

CHANGES IN ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS OR OTHER LAWS

THAT INCREASE OUR COST OF COMPLIANCE OR REDUCE OR DELAY AVAILABLE BUSINESS

OPPORTUNITIES (INCLUDING CHANGES IN LAWS RELATED TO OFFSHORE DRILLING

OPERATIONS, WATER USE, METHANE EMISSIONS, OR HYDRAULIC FRACTURING);

·

ADOPTION OF REGULATIONS MANDATING THE USE OF

ALTERNATIVE FUELS OR UNCOMPETITIVE FUEL COMPONENTS;

·

ADOPTION OF GOVERNMENT PAYMENT TRANSPARENCY

REGULATIONS THAT COULD REQUIRE US TO DISCLOSE COMPETITIVELY SENSITIVE

COMMERCIAL INFORMATION, OR THAT COULD CAUSE US TO VIOLATE THE NON-DISCLOSURE

LAWS OF OTHER COUNTRIES; AND

·

GOVERNMENT ACTIONS TO CANCEL CONTRACTS,

RE-DENOMINATE THE OFFICIAL CURRENCY, RENOUNCE OR DEFAULT ON OBLIGATIONS,

RENEGOTIATE TERMS UNILATERALLY, OR EXPROPRIATE ASSETS.

LEGAL REMEDIES AVAILABLE TO COMPENSATE US FOR

EXPROPRIATION OR OTHER TAKINGS MAY BE INADEQUATE.

WE ALSO MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY THE OUTCOME OF

LITIGATION, ESPECIALLY IN COUNTRIES SUCH AS THE UNITED STATES IN WHICH VERY

LARGE AND UNPREDICTABLE PUNITIVE DAMAGE AWARDS MAY OCCUR, OR BY GOVERNMENT

ENFORCEMENT PROCEEDINGS ALLEGING NON-COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE LAWS OR

REGULATIONS.

SECURITY CONCERNS.

SUCCESSFUL OPERATION OF PARTICULAR FACILITIES OR PROJECTS MAY BE

DISRUPTED BY CIVIL UNREST, ACTS OF SABOTAGE OR TERRORISM, AND OTHER LOCAL

SECURITY CONCERNS. SUCH CONCERNS MAY REQUIRE US TO INCUR GREATER COSTS FOR

SECURITY OR TO SHUT DOWN OPERATIONS FOR A PERIOD OF TIME.

CLIMATE CHANGE AND GREENHOUSE GAS RESTRICTIONS.

DUE TO CONCERN OVER THE RISK OF CLIMATE CHANGE, A

NUMBER OF COUNTRIES HAVE ADOPTED, OR ARE CONSIDERING THE ADOPTION OF,

REGULATORY FRAMEWORKS TO REDUCE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS. THESE INCLUDE

ADOPTION OF CAP AND TRADE REGIMES, CARBON TAXES, RESTRICTIVE PERMITTING,

INCREASED EFFICIENCY STANDARDS, AND INCENTIVES OR MANDATES FOR RENEWABLE

ENERGY. THESE REQUIREMENTS COULD MAKE OUR PRODUCTS MORE EXPENSIVE, LENGTHEN

PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION TIMES, AND REDUCE DEMAND FOR HYDROCARBONS, AS WELL AS

SHIFT HYDROCARBON DEMAND TOWARD RELATIVELY LOWER-CARBON SOURCES SUCH AS NATURAL

GAS. CURRENT AND PENDING GREENHOUSE GAS REGULATIONS MAY ALSO INCREASE OUR

COMPLIANCE COSTS, SUCH AS FOR MONITORING OR SEQUESTERING EMISSIONS.

GOVERNMENT SPONSORSHIP OF ALTERNATIVE ENERGY.

MANY GOVERNMENTS ARE PROVIDING TAX ADVANTAGES AND OTHER

SUBSIDIES TO SUPPORT ALTERNATIVE ENERGY SOURCES OR ARE MANDATING THE USE OF

SPECIFIC FUELS OR TECHNOLOGIES. GOVERNMENTS AND OTHERS ARE ALSO PROMOTING

RESEARCH INTO NEW TECHNOLOGIES TO REDUCE THE COST AND INCREASE THE SCALABILITY

OF ALTERNATIVE ENERGY SOURCES. WE ARE CONDUCTING OUR OWN RESEARCH BOTH IN-HOUSE

AND BY WORKING WITH MORE THAN 80 LEADING UNIVERSITIES AROUND THE WORLD,

INCLUDING THE MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY, PRINCETON UNIVERSITY, THE

UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS, AND STANFORD UNIVERSITY. OUR RESEARCH PROJECTS FOCUS ON

DEVELOPING ALGAE-BASED BIOFUELS, CARBON CAPTURE AND STORAGE, BREAKTHROUGH

ENERGY EFFICIENCY PROCESSES, ADVANCED ENERGY-SAVING MATERIALS AND OTHER

TECHNOLOGIES. FOR EXAMPLE, EXXONMOBIL IS WORKING WITH FUEL CELL ENERGY INC. TO EXPLORE

USING CARBONATE FUEL CELLS TO ECONOMICALLY CAPTURE CO

2

EMISSIONS

FROM GAS-FIRED POWER PLANTS. OUR FUTURE RESULTS MAY DEPEND IN PART ON THE

SUCCESS OF OUR RESEARCH EFFORTS AND ON OUR ABILITY TO ADAPT AND APPLY THE

STRENGTHS OF OUR CURRENT BUSINESS MODEL TO PROVIDING THE ENERGY PRODUCTS OF THE

FUTURE IN A COST-COMPETITIVE MANNER. SEE “MANAGEMENT EFFECTIVENESS” BELOW.

MANAGEMENT EFFECTIVENESS

IN ADDITION TO EXTERNAL ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL

FACTORS, OUR FUTURE BUSINESS RESULTS ALSO DEPEND ON OUR ABILITY TO MANAGE

SUCCESSFULLY THOSE FACTORS THAT ARE AT LEAST IN PART WITHIN OUR CONTROL. THE

EXTENT TO WHICH WE MANAGE THESE FACTORS WILL IMPACT OUR PERFORMANCE RELATIVE TO

COMPETITION. FOR PROJECTS IN WHICH WE ARE NOT THE OPERATOR, WE DEPEND ON THE MANAGEMENT

EFFECTIVENESS OF ONE OR MORE CO-VENTURERS WHOM WE DO NOT CONTROL.

EXPLORATION AND DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM.

OUR ABILITY TO MAINTAIN AND GROW OUR OIL AND GAS

PRODUCTION DEPENDS ON THE SUCCESS OF OUR EXPLORATION AND DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS.

AMONG OTHER FACTORS, WE MUST CONTINUOUSLY IMPROVE OUR ABILITY TO IDENTIFY THE

MOST PROMISING RESOURCE PROSPECTS AND APPLY OUR PROJECT MANAGEMENT EXPERTISE TO

BRING DISCOVERED RESOURCES ON LINE AS SCHEDULED AND WITHIN BUDGET.

PROJECT MANAGEMENT.

THE SUCCESS OF EXXONMOBIL’S UPSTREAM, DOWNSTREAM, AND CHEMICAL BUSINESSES

DEPENDS ON COMPLEX, LONG‐TERM, CAPITAL INTENSIVE PROJECTS. THESE PROJECTS

IN TURN REQUIRE A HIGH DEGREE OF PROJECT MANAGEMENT EXPERTISE TO MAXIMIZE

EFFICIENCY. SPECIFIC FACTORS THAT CAN AFFECT THE PERFORMANCE OF MAJOR PROJECTS

INCLUDE OUR ABILITY TO: NEGOTIATE SUCCESSFULLY WITH JOINT VENTURERS, PARTNERS,

GOVERNMENTS, SUPPLIERS, CUSTOMERS, OR OTHERS; MODEL AND OPTIMIZE RESERVOIR

PERFORMANCE; DEVELOP MARKETS FOR PROJECT OUTPUTS, WHETHER THROUGH LONG-TERM

CONTRACTS OR THE DEVELOPMENT OF EFFECTIVE SPOT MARKETS; MANAGE CHANGES IN

OPERATING CONDITIONS AND COSTS, INCLUDING COSTS OF THIRD PARTY EQUIPMENT OR

SERVICES SUCH AS DRILLING RIGS AND SHIPPING; PREVENT, TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE,

AND RESPOND EFFECTIVELY TO UNFORESEEN TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES THAT COULD DELAY

PROJECT STARTUP OR CAUSE UNSCHEDULED PROJECT DOWNTIME; AND INFLUENCE THE

PERFORMANCE OF PROJECT OPERATORS WHERE EXXONMOBIL DOES NOT PERFORM THAT ROLE.

3

THE TERM “PROJECT” AS USED IN THIS REPORT CAN REFER TO

A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT ACTIVITIES AND DOES NOT NECESSARILY HAVE THE SAME

MEANING AS IN ANY GOVERNMENT PAYMENT TRANSPARENCY REPORTS.

OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCY.

AN IMPORTANT COMPONENT OF EXXONMOBIL’S COMPETITIVE

PERFORMANCE, ESPECIALLY GIVEN THE COMMODITY‐BASED NATURE OF MANY OF OUR

BUSINESSES, IS OUR ABILITY TO OPERATE EFFICIENTLY, INCLUDING OUR ABILITY TO

MANAGE EXPENSES AND IMPROVE PRODUCTION YIELDS ON AN ONGOING BASIS. THIS

REQUIRES CONTINUOUS MANAGEMENT FOCUS, INCLUDING TECHNOLOGY IMPROVEMENTS, COST

CONTROL, PRODUCTIVITY ENHANCEMENTS, REGULAR REAPPRAISAL OF OUR ASSET PORTFOLIO,

AND THE RECRUITMENT, DEVELOPMENT, AND RETENTION OF HIGH CALIBER EMPLOYEES.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT.

TO MAINTAIN OUR COMPETITIVE POSITION, ESPECIALLY IN

LIGHT OF THE TECHNOLOGICAL NATURE OF OUR BUSINESSES AND THE NEED FOR CONTINUOUS

EFFICIENCY IMPROVEMENT, EXXONMOBIL’S RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ORGANIZATIONS

MUST BE SUCCESSFUL AND ABLE TO ADAPT TO A CHANGING MARKET AND POLICY

ENVIRONMENT, INCLUDING DEVELOPING TECHNOLOGIES TO HELP REDUCE GREENHOUSE GAS

EMISSIONS.

SAFETY, BUSINESS CONTROLS, AND ENVIRONMENTAL RISK

MANAGEMENT.

OUR RESULTS DEPEND ON

MANAGEMENT’S ABILITY TO MINIMIZE THE INHERENT RISKS OF OIL, GAS, AND

PETROCHEMICAL OPERATIONS, TO CONTROL EFFECTIVELY OUR BUSINESS ACTIVITIES, AND

TO MINIMIZE THE POTENTIAL FOR HUMAN ERROR. WE APPLY RIGOROUS MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS

AND CONTINUOUS FOCUS TO WORKPLACE SAFETY AND TO AVOIDING SPILLS OR OTHER

ADVERSE ENVIRONMENTAL EVENTS. FOR EXAMPLE, WE WORK TO MINIMIZE SPILLS THROUGH A

COMBINED PROGRAM OF EFFECTIVE OPERATIONS INTEGRITY MANAGEMENT, ONGOING

UPGRADES, KEY EQUIPMENT REPLACEMENTS, AND COMPREHENSIVE INSPECTION AND

SURVEILLANCE. SIMILARLY, WE ARE IMPLEMENTING COST-EFFECTIVE NEW TECHNOLOGIES

AND ADOPTING NEW OPERATING PRACTICES TO REDUCE AIR EMISSIONS, NOT ONLY IN

RESPONSE TO GOVERNMENT REQUIREMENTS BUT ALSO TO ADDRESS COMMUNITY PRIORITIES.

WE ALSO MAINTAIN A DISCIPLINED FRAMEWORK OF INTERNAL CONTROLS AND APPLY A

CONTROLS MANAGEMENT SYSTEM FOR MONITORING COMPLIANCE WITH THIS FRAMEWORK.

SUBSTANTIAL LIABILITIES AND OTHER ADVERSE IMPACTS COULD RESULT IF OUR

MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS AND CONTROLS DO NOT FUNCTION AS INTENDED. THE ABILITY TO

INSURE AGAINST SUCH RISKS IS LIMITED BY THE CAPACITY OF THE APPLICABLE

INSURANCE MARKETS, WHICH MAY NOT BE SUFFICIENT.

BUSINESS RISKS ALSO INCLUDE THE RISK OF CYBERSECURITY

BREACHES. IF OUR SYSTEMS FOR PROTECTING AGAINST CYBERSECURITY RISKS PROVE NOT

TO BE SUFFICIENT, EXXONMOBIL COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED SUCH AS BY HAVING ITS

BUSINESS SYSTEMS COMPROMISED, ITS PROPRIETARY INFORMATION ALTERED, LOST OR

STOLEN, OR ITS BUSINESS OPERATIONS DISRUPTED.

PREPAREDNESS.

OUR OPERATIONS MAY BE DISRUPTED BY SEVERE WEATHER EVENTS, NATURAL DISASTERS,

HUMAN ERROR, AND SIMILAR EVENTS. FOR EXAMPLE, HURRICANES MAY DAMAGE OUR

OFFSHORE PRODUCTION FACILITIES OR COASTAL REFINING AND PETROCHEMICAL PLANTS IN

VULNERABLE AREAS. OUR FACILITIES ARE DESIGNED, CONSTRUCTED, AND OPERATED TO

WITHSTAND A VARIETY OF EXTREME CLIMATIC AND OTHER CONDITIONS, WITH SAFETY

FACTORS BUILT IN TO COVER A NUMBER OF ENGINEERING UNCERTAINTIES, INCLUDING

THOSE ASSOCIATED WITH WAVE, WIND, AND CURRENT INTENSITY, MARINE ICE FLOW

PATTERNS, PERMAFROST STABILITY, STORM SURGE MAGNITUDE, TEMPERATURE EXTREMES,

EXTREME RAIN FALL EVENTS, AND EARTHQUAKES. OUR CONSIDERATION OF CHANGING

WEATHER CONDITIONS AND INCLUSION OF SAFETY FACTORS IN DESIGN COVERS THE

ENGINEERING UNCERTAINTIES THAT CLIMATE CHANGE AND OTHER EVENTS MAY POTENTIALLY

INTRODUCE. OUR ABILITY TO MITIGATE THE ADVERSE IMPACTS OF THESE EVENTS DEPENDS

IN PART UPON THE EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR ROBUST FACILITY ENGINEERING AS WELL AS

OUR RIGOROUS DISASTER PREPAREDNESS AND RESPONSE AND BUSINESS CONTINUITY

PLANNING.

PROJECTIONS, ESTIMATES, AND DESCRIPTIONS OF

EXXONMOBIL’S PLANS AND OBJECTIVES INCLUDED OR INCORPORATED IN ITEMS 1, 1A, 2, 7

AND 7A OF THIS REPORT ARE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS. ACTUAL FUTURE RESULTS,

INCLUDING PROJECT COMPLETION DATES, PRODUCTION RATES, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, COSTS,

AND BUSINESS PLANS COULD DIFFER MATERIALLY DUE TO, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE

FACTORS DISCUSSED ABOVE AND ELSEWHERE IN THIS REPORT.

1. DISCLOSURE OF RESERVES

A. SUMMARY OF OIL AND GAS RESERVES AT

YEAR-END 2016

THE TABLE BELOW SUMMARIZES THE OIL-EQUIVALENT PROVED

RESERVES IN EACH GEOGRAPHIC AREA AND BY PRODUCT TYPE FOR CONSOLIDATED

SUBSIDIARIES AND EQUITY COMPANIES. GAS IS CONVERTED TO AN OIL-EQUIVALENT BASIS

AT SIX MILLION CUBIC FEET PER ONE THOUSAND BARRELS. THE CORPORATION HAS

REPORTED PROVED RESERVES ON THE BASIS OF THE AVERAGE OF THE

FIRST-DAY-OF-THE-MONTH PRICE FOR EACH MONTH DURING THE LAST 12-MONTH PERIOD. AS

A RESULT OF VERY LOW PRICES DURING 2016,

UNDER THE SEC DEFINITION OF PROVED RESERVES, CERTAIN QUANTITIES

OF OIL AND NATURAL GAS THAT QUALIFIED AS PROVED RESERVES IN PRIOR YEARS DID NOT

QUALIFY AS PROVED RESERVES AT YEAR-END 2016. AMONG THE FACTORS THAT WOULD

RESULT IN THESE AMOUNTS BEING RECOGNIZED AGAIN AS PROVED RESERVES AT SOME POINT

IN THE FUTURE ARE A RECOVERY IN AVERAGE PRICE LEVELS, A FURTHER DECLINE IN

COSTS, AND / OR OPERATING EFFICIENCIES.

OTHERWISE, NO MAJOR DISCOVERY OR OTHER FAVORABLE OR ADVERSE EVENT

HAS OCCURRED SINCE DECEMBER 31, 2016, THAT WOULD CAUSE A SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN

THE ESTIMATED PROVED RESERVES AS OF THAT DATE.

IN THE PRECEDING RESERVES INFORMATION, CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARY AND

EQUITY COMPANY RESERVES ARE REPORTED SEPARATELY. HOWEVER, THE CORPORATION

OPERATES ITS BUSINESS WITH THE SAME VIEW OF EQUITY COMPANY RESERVES AS IT HAS

FOR RESERVES FROM CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES.

THE CORPORATION ANTICIPATES SEVERAL PROJECTS WILL COME

ONLINE OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS PROVIDING ADDITIONAL PRODUCTION CAPACITY.

HOWEVER, ACTUAL VOLUMES WILL VARY FROM YEAR TO YEAR DUE TO THE TIMING OF

INDIVIDUAL PROJECT START-UPS; OPERATIONAL OUTAGES; RESERVOIR PERFORMANCE;

PERFORMANCE OF ENHANCED OIL RECOVERY PROJECTS; REGULATORY CHANGES; THE IMPACT

OF FISCAL AND COMMERCIAL TERMS; ASSET SALES; WEATHER EVENTS; PRICE EFFECTS ON

PRODUCTION SHARING CONTRACTS; CHANGES IN THE AMOUNT AND TIMING OF CAPITAL

INVESTMENTS THAT MAY VARY DEPENDING ON THE OIL AND GAS PRICE ENVIRONMENT; AND

OTHER FACTORS DESCRIBED IN ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS.

THE ESTIMATION OF PROVED RESERVES, WHICH IS BASED ON THE

REQUIREMENT OF REASONABLE CERTAINTY, IS AN ONGOING PROCESS BASED ON RIGOROUS

TECHNICAL EVALUATIONS, COMMERCIAL AND MARKET ASSESSMENTS AND DETAILED ANALYSIS

OF WELL AND RESERVOIR INFORMATION SUCH AS FLOW RATES AND RESERVOIR PRESSURES.

FURTHERMORE, THE CORPORATION ONLY RECORDS PROVED RESERVES FOR PROJECTS WHICH

HAVE RECEIVED SIGNIFICANT FUNDING COMMITMENTS BY MANAGEMENT MADE TOWARD THE

DEVELOPMENT OF THE RESERVES. ALTHOUGH THE CORPORATION IS REASONABLY CERTAIN

THAT PROVED RESERVES WILL BE PRODUCED, THE TIMING AND AMOUNT RECOVERED CAN BE

AFFECTED BY A NUMBER OF FACTORS INCLUDING COMPLETION OF DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS,

RESERVOIR PERFORMANCE, REGULATORY APPROVALS AND SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN PROJECTIONS

OF LONG-TERM OIL AND NATURAL GAS PRICE LEVELS. IN ADDITION, PROVED RESERVES

COULD BE AFFECTED BY AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF LOW PRICES WHICH COULD REDUCE THE

LEVEL OF THE CORPORATION’S CAPITAL SPENDING AND ALSO IMPACT OUR PARTNERS’

CAPACITY TO FUND THEIR SHARE OF JOINT PROJECTS.

AS NOTED ABOVE, CERTAIN QUANTITIES OF OIL AND NATURAL GAS

THAT QUALIFIED AS PROVED RESERVES IN PRIOR YEARS DID NOT QUALIFY AS PROVED

RESERVES AT YEAR-END 2016. AMOUNTS NO LONGER QUALIFYING AS PROVED RESERVES

INCLUDE THE ENTIRE 3.5 BILLION BARRELS OF BITUMEN AT KEARL. IN ADDITION, 0.8

BILLION BARRELS OF OIL EQUIVALENT ACROSS THE REMAINDER OF NORTH AMERICA NO

LONGER QUALIFY AS PROVED RESERVES MAINLY DUE TO THE ACCELERATION OF THE

PROJECTED END-OF-FIELD-LIFE. AMONG THE FACTORS THAT WOULD RESULT IN THESE

AMOUNTS BEING RECOGNIZED AGAIN AS PROVED RESERVES AT SOME POINT IN THE FUTURE

ARE A RECOVERY IN AVERAGE PRICE LEVELS, A FURTHER DECLINE IN COSTS, AND / OR

OPERATING EFFICIENCIES. UNDER THE TERMS OF CERTAIN CONTRACTUAL ARRANGEMENTS OR

GOVERNMENT ROYALTY REGIMES, LOWER PRICES CAN ALSO INCREASE PROVED RESERVES

ATTRIBUTABLE TO EXXONMOBIL. WE DO NOT EXPECT THE DOWNWARD REVISION OF REPORTED

PROVED RESERVES UNDER SEC DEFINITIONS TO AFFECT THE OPERATION OF THE UNDERLYING

PROJECTS OR TO ALTER OUR OUTLOOK FOR FUTURE PRODUCTION VOLUMES.

B. TECHNOLOGIES USED IN

ESTABLISHING PROVED RESERVES ADDITIONS IN 2016

ADDITIONS TO EXXONMOBIL’S PROVED RESERVES IN 2016 WERE

BASED ON ESTIMATES GENERATED THROUGH THE INTEGRATION OF AVAILABLE AND

APPROPRIATE GEOLOGICAL, ENGINEERING AND PRODUCTION DATA, UTILIZING

WELL-ESTABLISHED TECHNOLOGIES THAT HAVE BEEN DEMONSTRATED IN THE FIELD TO YIELD

REPEATABLE AND CONSISTENT RESULTS.

DATA USED IN THESE INTEGRATED ASSESSMENTS INCLUDED

INFORMATION OBTAINED DIRECTLY FROM THE SUBSURFACE VIA WELLBORES, SUCH AS WELL

LOGS, RESERVOIR CORE SAMPLES, FLUID SAMPLES, STATIC AND DYNAMIC PRESSURE

INFORMATION, PRODUCTION TEST DATA, AND SURVEILLANCE AND PERFORMANCE

INFORMATION. THE DATA UTILIZED ALSO INCLUDED SUBSURFACE INFORMATION OBTAINED

THROUGH INDIRECT MEASUREMENTS INCLUDING HIGH-QUALITY 3-D AND 4-D SEISMIC DATA,

CALIBRATED WITH AVAILABLE WELL CONTROL INFORMATION. THE TOOLS USED TO INTERPRET

THE DATA INCLUDED PROPRIETARY SEISMIC PROCESSING SOFTWARE, PROPRIETARY

RESERVOIR MODELING AND SIMULATION SOFTWARE, AND COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE DATA

ANALYSIS PACKAGES.

IN SOME CIRCUMSTANCES, WHERE APPROPRIATE ANALOG RESERVOIRS

WERE AVAILABLE, RESERVOIR PARAMETERS FROM THESE ANALOGS WERE USED TO INCREASE

THE QUALITY OF AND CONFIDENCE IN THE RESERVES ESTIMATES.

C. QUALIFICATIONS OF

RESERVES TECHNICAL OVERSIGHT GROUP AND INTERNAL CONTROLS OVER PROVED RESERVES

EXXONMOBIL HAS A DEDICATED GLOBAL RESERVES GROUP THAT

PROVIDES TECHNICAL OVERSIGHT AND IS SEPARATE FROM THE OPERATING ORGANIZATION.

PRIMARY RESPONSIBILITIES OF THIS GROUP INCLUDE OVERSIGHT OF THE RESERVES

ESTIMATION PROCESS FOR COMPLIANCE WITH SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (SEC)

RULES AND REGULATIONS, REVIEW OF ANNUAL CHANGES IN RESERVES ESTIMATES, AND THE

REPORTING OF EXXONMOBIL’S PROVED RESERVES. THIS GROUP ALSO MAINTAINS THE

OFFICIAL COMPANY RESERVES ESTIMATES FOR EXXONMOBIL’S PROVED RESERVES OF CRUDE

AND NATURAL GAS LIQUIDS, BITUMEN, SYNTHETIC OIL AND NATURAL GAS. IN ADDITION,

THE GROUP PROVIDES TRAINING TO PERSONNEL INVOLVED IN THE RESERVES ESTIMATION

AND REPORTING PROCESS WITHIN EXXONMOBIL AND ITS AFFILIATES. THE MANAGER OF THE

GLOBAL RESERVES GROUP HAS MORE THAN 25 YEARS OF EXPERIENCE IN RESERVOIR

ENGINEERING AND RESERVES ASSESSMENT AND HAS A DEGREE IN ENGINEERING. HE IS AN

ACTIVE MEMBER OF THE SOCIETY OF PETROLEUM ENGINEERS (SPE). THE GROUP IS STAFFED

WITH INDIVIDUALS THAT HAVE AN AVERAGE OF MORE THAN 20 YEARS OF TECHNICAL EXPERIENCE

IN THE PETROLEUM INDUSTRY, INCLUDING EXPERTISE IN THE CLASSIFICATION AND

CATEGORIZATION OF RESERVES UNDER THE SEC GUIDELINES. THIS GROUP INCLUDES

INDIVIDUALS WHO HOLD ADVANCED DEGREES IN EITHER ENGINEERING OR GEOLOGY. SEVERAL

MEMBERS OF THE GROUP HOLD PROFESSIONAL REGISTRATIONS IN THEIR FIELD OF

EXPERTISE, AND A MEMBER CURRENTLY SERVES ON THE SPE OIL AND GAS RESERVES

COMMITTEE.

6

THE GLOBAL RESERVES GROUP MAINTAINS A

CENTRAL DATABASE CONTAINING THE OFFICIAL COMPANY RESERVES ESTIMATES.

APPROPRIATE CONTROLS, INCLUDING LIMITATIONS ON DATABASE ACCESS AND UPDATE

CAPABILITIES, ARE IN PLACE TO ENSURE DATA INTEGRITY WITHIN THIS CENTRAL

DATABASE. AN ANNUAL REVIEW OF THE SYSTEM’S CONTROLS IS PERFORMED BY INTERNAL

AUDIT. KEY COMPONENTS OF THE RESERVES ESTIMATION PROCESS INCLUDE TECHNICAL

EVALUATIONS AND ANALYSIS OF WELL AND FIELD PERFORMANCE AND A RIGOROUS PEER

REVIEW. NO CHANGES MAY BE MADE TO THE RESERVES ESTIMATES IN THE CENTRAL

DATABASE, INCLUDING ADDITIONS OF ANY NEW INITIAL RESERVES ESTIMATES OR

SUBSEQUENT REVISIONS, UNLESS THESE CHANGES HAVE BEEN THOROUGHLY REVIEWED AND

EVALUATED BY DULY AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL WITHIN THE OPERATING ORGANIZATION. IN

ADDITION, CHANGES TO RESERVES ESTIMATES THAT EXCEED CERTAIN THRESHOLDS REQUIRE

FURTHER REVIEW AND APPROVAL OF THE APPROPRIATE LEVEL OF MANAGEMENT WITHIN THE

OPERATING ORGANIZATION BEFORE THE CHANGES MAY BE MADE IN THE CENTRAL DATABASE.

ENDORSEMENT BY THE GLOBAL RESERVES GROUP FOR ALL PROVED RESERVES CHANGES IS A

MANDATORY COMPONENT OF THIS REVIEW PROCESS. AFTER ALL CHANGES ARE MADE, REVIEWS

ARE HELD WITH SENIOR MANAGEMENT FOR FINAL ENDORSEMENT.

2.

PROVED UNDEVELOPED RESERVES

AT YEAR-END 2016, APPROXIMATELY 6.2 BILLION OIL-EQUIVALENT

BARRELS (GOEB) OF EXXONMOBIL’S PROVED RESERVES WERE CLASSIFIED AS PROVED

UNDEVELOPED. THIS REPRESENTS 31 PERCENT OF THE 20 GOEB REPORTED IN PROVED

RESERVES. THIS COMPARES TO THE 6.8 GOEB OF PROVED UNDEVELOPED RESERVES REPORTED

AT THE END OF 2015. DURING THE YEAR, EXXONMOBIL CONDUCTED DEVELOPMENT

ACTIVITIES IN OVER 100 FIELDS THAT RESULTED IN THE TRANSFER OF APPROXIMATELY 1

GOEB FROM PROVED UNDEVELOPED TO PROVED DEVELOPED RESERVES BY YEAR‐END.

THE LARGEST TRANSFERS WERE RELATED TO THE GORGON LNG PROJECT START-UP AND

DRILLING ACTIVITY AT UPPER ZAKUM, TENGIZ AND IN THE UNITED STATES. DURING 2016,

EXTENSIONS, PRIMARILY IN THE UNITED STATES, RESULTED IN AN ADDITION OF

APPROXIMATELY 0.4 GOEB OF PROVED UNDEVELOPED RESERVES.

OVERALL, INVESTMENTS OF $10.1 BILLION WERE MADE BY THE

CORPORATION DURING 2016 TO PROGRESS THE DEVELOPMENT OF REPORTED PROVED

UNDEVELOPED RESERVES, INCLUDING $9.3 BILLION FOR OIL AND GAS PRODUCING

ACTIVITIES AND AN ADDITIONAL $0.8 BILLION FOR OTHER NON-OIL AND GAS PRODUCING

ACTIVITIES SUCH AS THE CONSTRUCTION OF SUPPORT INFRASTRUCTURE AND OTHER RELATED

FACILITIES. THESE INVESTMENTS REPRESENTED 70 PERCENT OF THE $14.5 BILLION IN

TOTAL REPORTED UPSTREAM CAPITAL AND EXPLORATION EXPENDITURES. INVESTMENTS MADE

BY THE CORPORATION TO DEVELOP QUANTITIES WHICH NO LONGER MEET THE SEC DEFINITION

OF PROVED RESERVES DUE TO 2016 AVERAGE PRICES ARE INCLUDED IN THE $14.5 BILLION

OF UPSTREAM CAPITAL EXPENDITURES REPORTED ABOVE BUT ARE EXCLUDED FROM AMOUNTS

RELATED TO PROGRESSING THE DEVELOPMENT OF PROVED UNDEVELOPED RESERVES.

ONE OF EXXONMOBIL’S REQUIREMENTS FOR REPORTING PROVED

RESERVES IS THAT MANAGEMENT HAS MADE SIGNIFICANT FUNDING COMMITMENTS TOWARD THE

DEVELOPMENT OF THE RESERVES. EXXONMOBIL HAS A DISCIPLINED INVESTMENT STRATEGY

AND MANY MAJOR FIELDS REQUIRE LONG LEAD‐TIME IN ORDER TO BE DEVELOPED.

DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS TYPICALLY TAKE SEVERAL YEARS FROM THE TIME OF RECORDING

PROVED UNDEVELOPED RESERVES TO THE START OF PRODUCTION. HOWEVER, THE

DEVELOPMENT TIME FOR LARGE AND COMPLEX PROJECTS CAN EXCEED FIVE YEARS. PROVED

UNDEVELOPED RESERVES IN AUSTRALIA, THE UNITED STATES, KAZAKHSTAN, THE

NETHERLANDS, QATAR, AND NIGERIA HAVE REMAINED UNDEVELOPED FOR FIVE YEARS OR

MORE PRIMARILY DUE TO CONSTRAINTS ON THE CAPACITY OF INFRASTRUCTURE, THE PACE

OF CO‐VENTURER/GOVERNMENT FUNDING, AS WELL AS THE TIME REQUIRED TO

COMPLETE DEVELOPMENT FOR VERY LARGE PROJECTS. THE CORPORATION IS REASONABLY

CERTAIN THAT THESE PROVED RESERVES WILL BE PRODUCED; HOWEVER, THE TIMING AND

AMOUNT RECOVERED CAN BE AFFECTED BY A NUMBER OF FACTORS INCLUDING COMPLETION OF

DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS, RESERVOIR PERFORMANCE, REGULATORY APPROVALS, AND

SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN LONG-TERM OIL AND NATURAL GAS PRICE LEVELS. OF THE

PROVED UNDEVELOPED RESERVES THAT HAVE BEEN REPORTED FOR FIVE OR MORE YEARS,

OVER 80 PERCENT ARE CONTAINED IN THE AFOREMENTIONED COUNTRIES. THE LARGEST OF

THESE IS RELATED TO LNG/GAS PROJECTS IN AUSTRALIA, WHERE CONSTRUCTION OF THE

GORGON LNG PROJECT IS IN THE FINAL PHASES. IN KAZAKHSTAN, THE PROVED

UNDEVELOPED RESERVES ARE RELATED TO THE REMAINDER OF THE INITIAL DEVELOPMENT OF

THE OFFSHORE KASHAGAN FIELD WHICH IS INCLUDED IN THE NORTH CASPIAN PRODUCTION

SHARING AGREEMENT AND THE TENGIZCHEVROIL JOINT VENTURE WHICH INCLUDES A

PRODUCTION LICENSE IN THE TENGIZ – KOROLEV FIELD COMPLEX. THE TENGIZCHEVROIL

JOINT VENTURE IS PRODUCING, AND PROVED UNDEVELOPED RESERVES WILL CONTINUE TO

MOVE TO PROVED DEVELOPED AS APPROVED DEVELOPMENT PHASES PROGRESS. IN THE

NETHERLANDS, THE GRONINGEN GAS FIELD HAS PROVED UNDEVELOPED RESERVES RELATED TO

INSTALLATION OF FUTURE STAGES OF COMPRESSION. THESE RESERVES WILL MOVE TO

PROVED DEVELOPED WHEN THE ADDITIONAL STAGES OF COMPRESSION ARE INSTALLED TO

MAINTAIN FIELD DELIVERY PRESSURE.

AVERAGE PRODUCTION PRICES HAVE BEEN CALCULATED BY USING

SALES QUANTITIES FROM THE CORPORATION’S OWN PRODUCTION AS THE DIVISOR. AVERAGE

PRODUCTION COSTS HAVE BEEN COMPUTED BY USING NET PRODUCTION QUANTITIES FOR THE

DIVISOR. THE VOLUMES OF CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS LIQUIDS (NGL) PRODUCTION USED

FOR THIS COMPUTATION ARE SHOWN IN THE OIL AND GAS PRODUCTION TABLE IN SECTION

3.A. THE VOLUMES OF NATURAL GAS USED IN THE CALCULATION ARE THE PRODUCTION

VOLUMES OF NATURAL GAS AVAILABLE FOR SALE AND ARE ALSO SHOWN IN SECTION 3.A.

THE NATURAL GAS AVAILABLE FOR SALE VOLUMES ARE DIFFERENT FROM THOSE SHOWN IN

THE RESERVES TABLE IN THE “OIL AND GAS RESERVES” PART OF THE “SUPPLEMENTAL

INFORMATION ON OIL AND GAS EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION ACTIVITIES” PORTION OF

THE FINANCIAL SECTION OF THIS REPORT DUE TO VOLUMES CONSUMED OR FLARED. GAS IS

CONVERTED TO AN OIL-EQUIVALENT BASIS AT SIX MILLION CUBIC FEET PER ONE THOUSAND

B. EXPLORATORY AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES REGARDING OIL AND GAS

RESOURCES EXTRACTED BY MINING TECHNOLOGIES

SYNCRUDE OPERATIONS.

SYNCRUDE IS A JOINT VENTURE ESTABLISHED TO

RECOVER SHALLOW DEPOSITS OF OIL SANDS USING OPEN-PIT MINING METHODS TO EXTRACT

THE CRUDE BITUMEN, AND THEN UPGRADE IT TO PRODUCE A HIGH-QUALITY, LIGHT (32

DEGREES API), SWEET, SYNTHETIC CRUDE OIL. IMPERIAL OIL LIMITED IS THE OWNER OF

A 25 PERCENT INTEREST IN THE JOINT VENTURE. EXXON MOBIL CORPORATION HAS A

69.6 PERCENT INTEREST IN IMPERIAL OIL LIMITED. IN 2016, THE COMPANY’S

SHARE OF NET PRODUCTION OF SYNTHETIC CRUDE OIL WAS ABOUT 67 THOUSAND

BARRELS PER DAY AND SHARE OF NET ACREAGE WAS ABOUT 63 THOUSAND ACRES IN

THE ATHABASCA OIL SANDS DEPOSIT.

KEARL OPERATIONS.

KEARL IS A JOINT VENTURE ESTABLISHED TO

RECOVER SHALLOW DEPOSITS OF OIL SANDS USING OPEN-PIT MINING METHODS TO EXTRACT

THE CRUDE BITUMEN. IMPERIAL OIL LIMITED HOLDS A 70.96 PERCENT INTEREST IN THE

JOINT VENTURE AND EXXONMOBIL CANADA PROPERTIES HOLDS THE OTHER 29.04 PERCENT.

EXXON MOBIL CORPORATION HAS A 69.6 PERCENT INTEREST IN IMPERIAL OIL LIMITED AND

A 100 PERCENT INTEREST IN EXXONMOBIL CANADA PROPERTIES. KEARL IS COMPRISED

OF SIX OIL SANDS LEASES COVERING ABOUT 49 THOUSAND ACRES IN THE ATHABASCA OIL

SANDS DEPOSIT.

KEARL IS LOCATED APPROXIMATELY 40 MILES NORTH OF FORT

MCMURRAY, ALBERTA, CANADA. BITUMEN IS EXTRACTED FROM OIL SANDS PRODUCED FROM

OPEN-PIT MINING OPERATIONS, AND PROCESSED THROUGH BITUMEN EXTRACTION AND FROTH

TREATMENT TRAINS. THE PRODUCT, A BLEND OF BITUMEN AND DILUENT, IS SHIPPED TO OUR

REFINERIES AND TO OTHER THIRD PARTIES. DILUENT IS NATURAL GAS CONDENSATE OR

OTHER LIGHT HYDROCARBONS ADDED TO THE CRUDE BITUMEN TO FACILITATE

TRANSPORTATION BY PIPELINE AND RAIL. DURING 2016, AVERAGE NET PRODUCTION AT KEARL

WAS ABOUT 167 THOUSAND BARRELS PER DAY.

AS A RESULT OF VERY LOW PRICES DURING 2016, UNDER THE SEC

DEFINITION OF PROVED RESERVES, THE ENTIRE 3.5 BILLION BARRELS OF BITUMEN AT

KEARL DID NOT QUALIFY AS PROVED RESERVES AT YEAR-END 2016.

AMONG THE FACTORS THAT WOULD RESULT IN

THESE AMOUNTS BEING RECOGNIZED AGAIN AS PROVED RESERVES AT SOME POINT IN THE

FUTURE ARE A RECOVERY IN AVERAGE PRICE LEVELS, A FURTHER DECLINE IN COSTS, AND

/ OR OPERATING EFFICIENCIES.

EXXONMOBIL’S INVESTMENT IN DEVELOPED AND UNDEVELOPED

ACREAGE IS COMPRISED OF NUMEROUS CONCESSIONS, BLOCKS AND LEASES. THE TERMS AND

CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH THE CORPORATION MAINTAINS EXPLORATION AND/OR PRODUCTION

RIGHTS TO THE ACREAGE ARE PROPERTY‐SPECIFIC, CONTRACTUALLY DEFINED AND

VARY SIGNIFICANTLY FROM PROPERTY TO PROPERTY. WORK PROGRAMS ARE DESIGNED TO

ENSURE THAT THE EXPLORATION POTENTIAL OF ANY PROPERTY IS FULLY EVALUATED BEFORE

EXPIRATION. IN SOME INSTANCES, THE CORPORATION MAY ELECT TO RELINQUISH ACREAGE

IN ADVANCE OF THE CONTRACTUAL EXPIRATION DATE IF THE EVALUATION PROCESS IS

COMPLETE AND THERE IS NOT A BUSINESS BASIS FOR EXTENSION. IN CASES WHERE

ADDITIONAL TIME MAY BE REQUIRED TO FULLY EVALUATE ACREAGE, THE CORPORATION HAS

GENERALLY BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN OBTAINING EXTENSIONS. THE SCHEDULED EXPIRATION OF

LEASES AND CONCESSIONS FOR UNDEVELOPED ACREAGE OVER THE NEXT THREE YEARS IS NOT

EXPECTED TO HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON THE CORPORATION.

18

D. SUMMARY OF ACREAGE TERMS

UNITED STATES

OIL AND GAS EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION RIGHTS ARE ACQUIRED

FROM MINERAL INTEREST OWNERS THROUGH A LEASE. MINERAL INTEREST OWNERS INCLUDE

THE FEDERAL AND STATE GOVERNMENTS, AS WELL AS PRIVATE MINERAL INTEREST OWNERS.

LEASES TYPICALLY HAVE AN EXPLORATION PERIOD RANGING FROM ONE TO TEN YEARS, AND

A PRODUCTION PERIOD THAT NORMALLY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL PRODUCTION CEASES.

UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES, A LEASE MAY BE HELD BEYOND ITS EXPLORATION TERM

EVEN IF PRODUCTION HAS NOT COMMENCED. IN SOME INSTANCES REGARDING PRIVATE

PROPERTY, A “FEE INTEREST” IS ACQUIRED WHERE THE UNDERLYING MINERAL INTERESTS

ARE OWNED OUTRIGHT.

CANADA / SOUTH

AMERICA

CANADA

EXPLORATION LICENSES OR LEASES IN ONSHORE AREAS ARE ACQUIRED

FOR VARYING PERIODS OF TIME WITH RENEWALS OR EXTENSIONS POSSIBLE. THESE

LICENSES OR LEASES ENTITLE THE HOLDER TO CONTINUE EXISTING LICENSES OR LEASES

UPON COMPLETING SPECIFIED WORK. IN GENERAL, THESE LICENSE AND LEASE AGREEMENTS

ARE HELD AS LONG AS THERE IS PROVEN PRODUCTION CAPABILITY ON THE LICENSES AND

LEASES. EXPLORATION LICENSES IN OFFSHORE EASTERN CANADA AND THE BEAUFORT SEA

ARE HELD BY WORK COMMITMENTS OF VARIOUS AMOUNTS AND RENTALS. THEY ARE VALID FOR

25 YEARS, WITH RIGHTS OF EXTENSION FOR CONTINUED PRODUCTION. SIGNIFICANT

DISCOVERY LICENSES IN THE OFFSHORE, RELATING TO CURRENTLY UNDEVELOPED

DISCOVERIES, DO NOT HAVE A DEFINITE TERM.

YEARS, DIVIDED INTO THREE POTENTIAL EXPLORATION PERIODS, WITH AN OPTIONAL

EXTENSION FOR UP TO ONE YEAR DEPENDING ON THE CLASSIFICATION OF THE AREA.

PURSUANT TO THE AMENDED LAW, THE PRODUCTION TERM FOR A CONVENTIONAL PRODUCTION

CONCESSION WOULD BE 25 YEARS, AND 35 YEARS FOR AN UNCONVENTIONAL

NETHERLANDS

UNDER THE MINING LAW, EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2003,

EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION LICENSES FOR BOTH ONSHORE AND OFFSHORE AREAS ARE

ISSUED FOR A PERIOD AS EXPLICITLY DEFINED IN THE LICENSE. THE TERM IS BASED ON

THE PERIOD OF TIME NECESSARY TO PERFORM THE ACTIVITIES FOR WHICH THE LICENSE IS

ISSUED. LICENSE CONDITIONS ARE STIPULATED IN THE LICENSE AND ARE BASED ON THE

MINING LAW.

PRODUCTION RIGHTS GRANTED PRIOR TO JANUARY 1, 2003, REMAIN

SUBJECT TO THEIR EXISTING TERMS, AND DIFFER SLIGHTLY FOR ONSHORE AND OFFSHORE

AREAS. ONSHORE PRODUCTION LICENSES ISSUED PRIOR TO 1988 WERE INDEFINITE; FROM

1988 THEY WERE ISSUED FOR A PERIOD AS EXPLICITLY DEFINED IN THE LICENSE,

RANGING FROM 35 TO 45 YEARS. OFFSHORE PRODUCTION LICENSES ISSUED BEFORE 1976

WERE ISSUED FOR A FIXED PERIOD OF 40 YEARS; FROM 1976 THEY WERE AGAIN ISSUED

FOR A PERIOD AS EXPLICITLY DEFINED IN THE LICENSE, RANGING FROM 15 TO

40 YEARS.

NORWAY

INITIAL PERIOD OF ONE YEAR AT A TIME UP TO TEN YEARS AFTER 1985), AND AN

EXTENSION PERIOD OF UP TO 30 YEARS, WITH RELINQUISHMENT OF AT LEAST ONE-HALF OF

THE ORIGINAL AREA REQUIRED AT THE END OF THE INITIAL PERIOD. LICENSES ISSUED

RELINQUISHMENT OF AT LEAST ONE-HALF OF THE ORIGINAL AREA REQUIRED AT THE END OF

THE INITIAL PERIOD.

UNITED

KINGDOM

ACREAGE TERMS ARE FIXED BY THE GOVERNMENT AND ARE

PERIODICALLY CHANGED. FOR EXAMPLE, MANY OF THE EARLY LICENSES ISSUED UNDER THE

FIRST FOUR LICENSING ROUNDS PROVIDED FOR AN INITIAL TERM OF SIX YEARS WITH

RELINQUISHMENT OF AT LEAST ONE-HALF OF THE ORIGINAL AREA AT THE END OF THE

INITIAL TERM, SUBJECT TO EXTENSION FOR A FURTHER 40 YEARS. AT THE END OF ANY

SUCH 40-YEAR TERM, LICENSES MAY CONTINUE IN PRODUCING AREAS UNTIL CESSATION OF

PRODUCTION; OR LICENSES MAY CONTINUE IN DEVELOPMENT AREAS FOR PERIODS AGREED ON

A CASE-BY-CASE BASIS UNTIL THEY BECOME PRODUCING AREAS; OR LICENSES TERMINATE

IN ALL OTHER AREAS. THE LICENSING REGIME WAS LAST UPDATED IN 2002, AND THE

MAJORITY OF LICENSES ISSUED HAVE AN INITIAL TERM OF FOUR YEARS WITH A SECOND

TERM EXTENSION OF FOUR YEARS AND A FINAL TERM OF 18 YEARS WITH A MANDATORY

RELINQUISHMENT OF 50 PERCENT OF THE ACREAGE AFTER THE INITIAL TERM AND OF ALL

ACREAGE THAT IS NOT COVERED BY A DEVELOPMENT PLAN AT THE END OF THE SECOND

TERM.

AFRICA

ANGOLA

EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION ACTIVITIES ARE GOVERNED BY

PRODUCTION SHARING AGREEMENTS WITH AN INITIAL EXPLORATION TERM OF FOUR YEARS

AND AN OPTIONAL SECOND PHASE OF TWO TO THREE YEARS. THE PRODUCTION PERIOD IS

FOR 25 YEARS, AND AGREEMENTS GENERALLY PROVIDE FOR A NEGOTIATED EXTENSION.

CHAD

EXPLORATION PERMITS ARE ISSUED FOR A PERIOD OF FIVE YEARS,

CONDITIONS OF THE PERMITS, INCLUDING RELINQUISHMENT OBLIGATIONS, ARE SPECIFIED

IN A NEGOTIATED CONVENTION. THE PRODUCTION TERM IS FOR 30 YEARS AND MAY BE

EXTENDED UP TO 50 YEARS AT THE DISCRETION OF THE GOVERNMENT.

EQUATORIAL GUINEA

EXPLORATION, DEVELOPMENT AND PRODUCTION ACTIVITIES ARE

GOVERNED BY PRODUCTION SHARING CONTRACTS (PSCS) NEGOTIATED WITH THE STATE

MINISTRY OF MINES AND HYDROCARBONS. A NEW PSC WAS SIGNED IN 2015; THE INITIAL

EXPLORATION PERIOD IS FIVE YEARS FOR OIL AND GAS, WITH MULTI-YEAR EXTENSIONS

AVAILABLE AT THE DISCRETION OF THE MINISTRY AND LIMITED RELINQUISHMENTS IN THE

ABSENCE OF COMMERCIAL DISCOVERIES. THE PRODUCTION PERIOD FOR CRUDE OIL RANGES

FROM 25 TO 30 YEARS, WHILE THE PRODUCTION PERIOD FOR NATURAL GAS RANGES FROM 25

TO 50 YEARS.

NIGERIA

EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION ACTIVITIES IN THE DEEPWATER

OFFSHORE AREAS ARE TYPICALLY GOVERNED BY PRODUCTION SHARING CONTRACTS (PSCS)

WITH THE NATIONAL OIL COMPANY, THE NIGERIAN NATIONAL PETROLEUM CORPORATION

(NNPC). NNPC TYPICALLY HOLDS THE UNDERLYING OIL PROSPECTING LICENSE (OPL) AND

ANY RESULTING OIL MINING LEASE (OML). THE TERMS OF THE PSCS ARE GENERALLY 30

YEARS, INCLUDING A TEN-YEAR EXPLORATION PERIOD (AN INITIAL EXPLORATION PHASE

THAT CAN BE DIVIDED INTO MULTIPLE OPTIONAL PERIODS) COVERED BY AN OPL. UPON

COMMERCIAL DISCOVERY, AN OPL MAY BE CONVERTED TO AN OML. PARTIAL RELINQUISHMENT

IS REQUIRED UNDER THE PSC AT THE END OF THE TEN-YEAR EXPLORATION PERIOD, AND

OMLS HAVE A 20-YEAR PRODUCTION PERIOD THAT MAY BE EXTENDED.

SOME EXPLORATION ACTIVITIES ARE CARRIED OUT IN DEEPWATER BY

JOINT VENTURES WITH LOCAL COMPANIES HOLDING INTERESTS IN AN OPL. OPLS IN

DEEPWATER OFFSHORE AREAS ARE VALID FOR TEN YEARS, WHILE IN ALL OTHER AREAS THE

LICENSES ARE FOR FIVE YEARS. DEMONSTRATING A COMMERCIAL DISCOVERY IS THE BASIS

FOR CONVERSION OF AN OPL TO AN OML.

OMLS GRANTED PRIOR TO THE 1969 PETROLEUM ACT (I.E., UNDER

THE MINERAL OILS ACT 1914, REPEALED BY THE 1969 PETROLEUM ACT) WERE FOR 30

YEARS ONSHORE AND 40 YEARS IN OFFSHORE AREAS AND HAVE BEEN RENEWED, EFFECTIVE

DECEMBER 1, 2008, FOR A FURTHER PERIOD OF 20 YEARS, WITH A FURTHER RENEWAL

OPTION OF 20 YEARS. OPERATIONS UNDER THESE PRE-1969 OMLS ARE CONDUCTED UNDER A

JOINT VENTURE AGREEMENT WITH NNPC RATHER THAN A PSC. COMMERCIAL TERMS

APPLICABLE TO THE EXISTING JOINT VENTURE OIL PRODUCTION ARE DEFINED BY THE

PETROLEUM PROFITS TAX ACT.

OMLS GRANTED UNDER THE 1969 PETROLEUM ACT, WHICH INCLUDE

ALL DEEPWATER OMLS, HAVE A MAXIMUM TERM OF 20 YEARS WITHOUT DISTINCTION FOR

ONSHORE OR OFFSHORE LOCATION AND ARE RENEWABLE, UPON 12 MONTHS’ WRITTEN NOTICE,

FOR ANOTHER PERIOD OF 20 YEARS. OMLS NOT HELD BY NNPC ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO A

MANDATORY 50-PERCENT RELINQUISHMENT AFTER THE FIRST TEN YEARS OF THEIR DURATION.

INDONESIA’S CONSTITUTIONAL COURT RULED CERTAIN ARTICLES OF LAW RELATING TO

BPMIGAS TO BE UNCONSTITUTIONAL, BUT STATED THAT ALL EXISTING PSCS SIGNED WITH

BPMIGAS SHOULD REMAIN IN FORCE UNTIL THEIR EXPIRY, AND THE FUNCTIONS AND DUTIES

OF THE GOVERNMENT OF INDONESIA UNTIL THE PROMULGATION OF A NEW OIL AND GAS LAW.

BY PRESIDENTIAL DECREE, SKKMIGAS BECAME THE INTERIM SUCCESSOR TO BPMIGAS. THE

CURRENT PSCS HAVE AN EXPLORATION PERIOD OF SIX YEARS, WHICH CAN BE EXTENDED UP

TO 10 YEARS, AND AN EXPLOITATION PERIOD OF 20 YEARS. PSCS GENERALLY REQUIRE THE

CONTRACTOR TO RELINQUISH 10 PERCENT TO 20 PERCENT OF THE CONTRACT AREA AFTER

THREE YEARS AND GENERALLY ALLOW THE CONTRACTOR TO RETAIN NO MORE THAN 50

PERCENT TO 80 PERCENT OF THE ORIGINAL CONTRACT AREA AFTER SIX YEARS, DEPENDING

ON THE ACREAGE AND TERMS.

FREQUENTLY USED TERMS

LISTED BELOW ARE DEFINITIONS OF SEVERAL OF

EXXONMOBIL’S KEY BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE MEASURES. THESE DEFINITIONS

ARE PROVIDED TO FACILITATE UNDERSTANDING OF THE TERMS AND THEIR CALCULATION.

CASH FLOW FROM OPERATIONS AND ASSET SALES

CASH

FLOW FROM OPERATIONS AND ASSET SALES IS THE SUM OF THE NET CASH PROVIDED BY

OPERATING ACTIVITIES AND PROCEEDS ASSOCIATED WITH SALES OF SUBSIDIARIES,

PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT, AND SALES AND RETURNS OF INVESTMENTS FROM THE

CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS. THIS CASH FLOW REFLECTS THE TOTAL SOURCES

OF CASH FROM BOTH OPERATING THE CORPORATION’S ASSETS AND FROM THE DIVESTING OF

ASSETS. THE CORPORATION EMPLOYS A LONG-STANDING AND REGULAR DISCIPLINED REVIEW

PROCESS TO ENSURE THAT ALL ASSETS ARE CONTRIBUTING TO THE CORPORATION’S

STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES. ASSETS ARE DIVESTED WHEN THEY ARE NO LONGER MEETING THESE

OBJECTIVES OR ARE WORTH CONSIDERABLY MORE TO OTHERS. BECAUSE OF THE REGULAR

NATURE OF THIS ACTIVITY, WE BELIEVE IT IS USEFUL FOR INVESTORS TO CONSIDER

PROCEEDS ASSOCIATED WITH ASSET SALES TOGETHER WITH CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING

ACTIVITIES WHEN EVALUATING CASH AVAILABLE FOR INVESTMENT IN THE BUSINESS AND

FINANCING ACTIVITIES, INCLUDING SHAREHOLDER DISTRIBUTIONS.

EXXONMOBIL’S SHARE OF TOTAL DEBT AND EQUITY. BOTH OF THESE VIEWS INCLUDE

EXXONMOBIL’S SHARE OF AMOUNTS APPLICABLE TO EQUITY COMPANIES, WHICH THE

AVERAGE CAPITAL EMPLOYED

RETURN

ON AVERAGE CAPITAL EMPLOYED (ROCE) IS A PERFORMANCE MEASURE RATIO. FROM THE

PERSPECTIVE OF THE BUSINESS SEGMENTS, ROCE IS ANNUAL BUSINESS SEGMENT EARNINGS

DIVIDED BY AVERAGE BUSINESS SEGMENT CAPITAL EMPLOYED (AVERAGE OF BEGINNING AND

END-OF-YEAR AMOUNTS). THESE SEGMENT EARNINGS INCLUDE EXXONMOBIL’S SHARE OF

SEGMENT EARNINGS OF EQUITY COMPANIES, CONSISTENT WITH OUR CAPITAL EMPLOYED

DEFINITION, AND EXCLUDE THE COST OF FINANCING. THE CORPORATION’S TOTAL ROCE IS

NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO EXXONMOBIL EXCLUDING THE AFTER-TAX COST OF

FINANCING, DIVIDED BY TOTAL CORPORATE AVERAGE CAPITAL EMPLOYED. THE CORPORATION

HAS CONSISTENTLY APPLIED ITS ROCE DEFINITION FOR MANY YEARS AND VIEWS IT AS THE

BEST MEASURE OF HISTORICAL CAPITAL PRODUCTIVITY IN OUR CAPITAL-INTENSIVE,

LONG-TERM INDUSTRY, BOTH TO EVALUATE MANAGEMENT’S PERFORMANCE AND TO

DEMONSTRATE TO SHAREHOLDERS THAT CAPITAL HAS BEEN USED WISELY OVER THE LONG

TERM. ADDITIONAL MEASURES, WHICH ARE MORE CASH FLOW BASED, ARE USED TO MAKE

INVESTMENT DECISIONS.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

OVERVIEW

THE

FOLLOWING DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF EXXONMOBIL’S FINANCIAL RESULTS, AS WELL AS

THE ACCOMPANYING FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND RELATED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS TO WHICH THEY REFER, ARE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE

MANAGEMENT OF EXXON MOBIL CORPORATION. THE CORPORATION’S ACCOUNTING AND

FINANCIAL REPORTING FAIRLY REFLECT ITS STRAIGHTFORWARD BUSINESS MODEL INVOLVING

THE EXTRACTING, MANUFACTURING AND MARKETING OF HYDROCARBONS AND

HYDROCARBON-BASED PRODUCTS. THE CORPORATION’S BUSINESS MODEL INVOLVES THE

PRODUCTION (OR PURCHASE), MANUFACTURE AND SALE OF PHYSICAL PRODUCTS, AND ALL

COMMERCIAL ACTIVITIES ARE DIRECTLY IN SUPPORT OF THE UNDERLYING PHYSICAL

MOVEMENT OF GOODS.

EXXONMOBIL,

WITH ITS RESOURCE BASE, FINANCIAL STRENGTH, DISCIPLINED INVESTMENT APPROACH AND

TECHNOLOGY PORTFOLIO, IS WELL‐POSITIONED TO PARTICIPATE IN SUBSTANTIAL

INVESTMENTS TO DEVELOP NEW ENERGY SUPPLIES. THE COMPANY’S INTEGRATED BUSINESS

MODEL, WITH SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS IN UPSTREAM, DOWNSTREAM AND CHEMICAL

SEGMENTS, REDUCES THE CORPORATION’S RISK FROM CHANGES IN COMMODITY PRICES. WHILE

COMMODITY PRICES ARE VOLATILE ON A SHORT-TERM BASIS AND DEPEND ON SUPPLY AND

DEMAND, EXXONMOBIL’S INVESTMENT DECISIONS ARE BASED ON OUR LONG-TERM BUSINESS

OUTLOOK, USING A DISCIPLINED APPROACH IN SELECTING AND PURSUING THE MOST

ATTRACTIVE INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES. THE CORPORATE PLAN IS A FUNDAMENTAL ANNUAL

MANAGEMENT PROCESS THAT IS THE BASIS FOR SETTING NEAR-TERM OPERATING AND

CAPITAL OBJECTIVES IN ADDITION TO PROVIDING THE LONGER-TERM ECONOMIC

ASSUMPTIONS USED FOR INVESTMENT EVALUATION PURPOSES. VOLUMES ARE BASED ON

INDIVIDUAL FIELD PRODUCTION PROFILES, WHICH ARE ALSO UPDATED ANNUALLY. PRICE

RANGES FOR CRUDE OIL, NATURAL GAS, REFINED PRODUCTS, AND CHEMICAL PRODUCTS ARE

BASED ON CORPORATE PLAN ASSUMPTIONS DEVELOPED ANNUALLY BY MAJOR REGION AND ARE

UTILIZED FOR INVESTMENT EVALUATION PURPOSES. MAJOR INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES ARE

EVALUATED OVER A RANGE OF ECONOMIC SCENARIOS. ONCE MAJOR INVESTMENTS ARE MADE,

A REAPPRAISAL PROCESS IS COMPLETED TO ENSURE RELEVANT LESSONS ARE LEARNED AND

IMPROVEMENTS ARE INCORPORATED INTO FUTURE PROJECTS.

BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT AND RISK ASSESSMENT

LONG-TERM BUSINESS OUTLOOK

BY

2040, THE WORLD’S POPULATION IS PROJECTED TO GROW TO APPROXIMATELY

9 BILLION PEOPLE, OR ABOUT 1.8 BILLION MORE THAN IN 2015. COINCIDENT

WITH THIS POPULATION INCREASE, THE CORPORATION EXPECTS WORLDWIDE ECONOMIC

GROWTH TO AVERAGE CLOSE TO 3 PERCENT PER YEAR. AS ECONOMIES AND

POPULATIONS GROW, AND AS LIVING STANDARDS IMPROVE FOR BILLIONS OF PEOPLE, THE

NEED FOR ENERGY WILL CONTINUE TO RISE. EVEN WITH SIGNIFICANT EFFICIENCY GAINS,

GLOBAL ENERGY DEMAND IS PROJECTED TO RISE BY ABOUT 25 PERCENT FROM 2015 TO

2040. THIS DEMAND INCREASE IS EXPECTED TO BE CONCENTRATED IN DEVELOPING

COUNTRIES (I.E., THOSE THAT ARE NOT MEMBER NATIONS OF THE ORGANISATION FOR

ECONOMIC CO‐OPERATION AND DEVELOPMENT).

AS

EXPANDING PROSPERITY DRIVES GLOBAL ENERGY DEMAND HIGHER, INCREASING USE OF

ENERGY‐EFFICIENT TECHNOLOGIES AND PRACTICES AS WELL AS LOWER-EMISSION

FUELS WILL CONTINUE TO HELP SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE ENERGY CONSUMPTION AND

EMISSIONS PER UNIT OF ECONOMIC OUTPUT OVER TIME. SUBSTANTIAL EFFICIENCY GAINS

ARE LIKELY IN ALL KEY ASPECTS OF THE WORLD’S ECONOMY THROUGH 2040, AFFECTING

ENERGY REQUIREMENTS FOR TRANSPORTATION, POWER GENERATION, INDUSTRIAL

APPLICATIONS, AND RESIDENTIAL AND COMMERCIAL NEEDS.

ENERGY

FOR TRANSPORTATION – INCLUDING CARS, TRUCKS, SHIPS, TRAINS AND AIRPLANES – IS

EXPECTED TO INCREASE BY ABOUT 25 PERCENT FROM 2015 TO 2040. THE GROWTH IN

TRANSPORTATION ENERGY DEMAND IS LIKELY TO ACCOUNT FOR APPROXIMATELY 60 PERCENT

OF THE GROWTH IN LIQUID FUELS DEMAND WORLDWIDE OVER THIS PERIOD. NEARLY ALL THE

WORLD’S TRANSPORTATION FLEETS WILL CONTINUE TO RUN ON LIQUID FUELS, WHICH ARE ABUNDANT,

WIDELY AVAILABLE, EASY TO TRANSPORT, AND PROVIDE A LARGE QUANTITY OF ENERGY IN

SMALL VOLUMES.

DEMAND

FOR ELECTRICITY AROUND THE WORLD IS LIKELY TO INCREASE APPROXIMATELY

60 PERCENT FROM 2015 TO 2040, LED BY A DOUBLING OF DEMAND IN DEVELOPING

COUNTRIES. CONSISTENT WITH THIS PROJECTION, POWER GENERATION IS EXPECTED TO

REMAIN THE LARGEST AND FASTEST‐GROWING MAJOR SEGMENT OF GLOBAL ENERGY

DEMAND. MEETING THE EXPECTED GROWTH IN POWER DEMAND WILL REQUIRE A DIVERSE SET

OF ENERGY SOURCES. THE SHARE OF COAL‐FIRED GENERATION IS LIKELY TO

DECLINE TO LESS THAN 30 PERCENT OF THE WORLD’S ELECTRICITY IN 2040, VERSUS

ABOUT 40 PERCENT IN 2015, IN PART AS A RESULT OF POLICIES TO IMPROVE AIR

QUALITY AS WELL AS REDUCE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS TO ADDRESS THE RISKS OF

CLIMATE CHANGE. FROM 2015 TO 2040, THE AMOUNT OF ELECTRICITY GENERATED USING

NATURAL GAS, NUCLEAR POWER, AND RENEWABLES IS LIKELY TO APPROXIMATELY DOUBLE,

AND ACCOUNT FOR 90 PERCENT OF THE GROWTH IN ELECTRICITY SUPPLIES. BY 2040,

COAL, NATURAL GAS AND RENEWABLES ARE PROJECTED TO EACH BE GENERATING IN THE

RANGE OF 25-30 PERCENT OF ELECTRICITY WORLDWIDE, ALTHOUGH SIGNIFICANT

DIFFERENCES WILL EXIST ACROSS REGIONS REFLECTING A WIDE RANGE OF FACTORS

INCLUDING THE COST AND AVAILABILITY OF ENERGY TYPES.

LIQUID

FUELS PROVIDE THE LARGEST SHARE OF GLOBAL ENERGY SUPPLIES TODAY REFLECTING

BROAD-BASED AVAILABILITY, AFFORDABILITY, EASE OF DISTRIBUTION, AND FITNESS AS A

PRACTICAL SOLUTION TO MEET A WIDE VARIETY OF NEEDS. BY 2040, GLOBAL DEMAND FOR

LIQUID FUELS IS PROJECTED TO GROW TO APPROXIMATELY 112 MILLION BARRELS OF

OIL‐EQUIVALENT PER DAY, AN INCREASE OF ABOUT 20 PERCENT FROM 2015.

MUCH OF THIS DEMAND TODAY IS MET BY CRUDE PRODUCTION FROM TRADITIONAL

CONVENTIONAL SOURCES; THESE SUPPLIES WILL REMAIN IMPORTANT AS SIGNIFICANT

DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO OFFSET MUCH OF THE NATURAL DECLINES FROM

THESE FIELDS. AT THE SAME TIME, A VARIETY OF EMERGING SUPPLY SOURCES – INCLUDING

TIGHT OIL, DEEPWATER, OIL SANDS, NATURAL GAS LIQUIDS AND BIOFUELS – ARE

EXPECTED TO GROW SIGNIFICANTLY TO MEET RISING DEMAND. THE WORLD’S RESOURCE BASE

IS SUFFICIENT TO MEET PROJECTED DEMAND THROUGH

41

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

2040 AS

TECHNOLOGY ADVANCES CONTINUE TO EXPAND THE AVAILABILITY OF ECONOMIC SUPPLY

OPTIONS. HOWEVER, ACCESS TO RESOURCES AND TIMELY INVESTMENTS WILL REMAIN

CRITICAL TO MEETING GLOBAL NEEDS WITH RELIABLE, AFFORDABLE SUPPLIES.

NATURAL

GAS IS A VERSATILE FUEL, SUITABLE FOR A WIDE VARIETY OF APPLICATIONS, AND IT IS

EXPECTED TO BE THE FASTEST-GROWING MAJOR FUEL SOURCE FROM 2015 TO 2040, MEETING

ABOUT 40 PERCENT OF GLOBAL ENERGY DEMAND GROWTH. GLOBAL NATURAL GAS DEMAND

IS EXPECTED TO RISE ABOUT 45 PERCENT FROM 2015 TO 2040, WITH ABOUT

45 PERCENT OF THAT INCREASE IN THE ASIA PACIFIC REGION. HELPING MEET THESE

NEEDS WILL BE SIGNIFICANT GROWTH IN SUPPLIES OF UNCONVENTIONAL GAS ‐ THE

NATURAL GAS FOUND IN SHALE AND OTHER ROCK FORMATIONS THAT WAS ONCE CONSIDERED

UNECONOMIC TO PRODUCE. IN TOTAL, ABOUT 60 PERCENT OF THE GROWTH IN NATURAL

GAS SUPPLIES IS EXPECTED TO BE FROM UNCONVENTIONAL SOURCES. AT THE SAME TIME,

CONVENTIONALLY-PRODUCED NATURAL GAS IS LIKELY TO REMAIN THE CORNERSTONE OF

SUPPLY, MEETING ABOUT TWO‐THIRDS OF GLOBAL DEMAND IN 2040. WORLDWIDE

LIQUEFIED NATURAL GAS (LNG) TRADE WILL EXPAND SIGNIFICANTLY, LIKELY REACHING

MORE THAN 2.5 TIMES THE LEVEL OF 2015 BY 2040, WITH MUCH OF THIS SUPPLY

EXPECTED TO MEET RISING DEMAND IN ASIA PACIFIC.

THE

WORLD’S ENERGY MIX IS HIGHLY DIVERSE AND WILL REMAIN SO THROUGH 2040. OIL IS

EXPECTED TO REMAIN THE LARGEST SOURCE OF ENERGY WITH ITS SHARE REMAINING CLOSE

TO ONE‐THIRD IN 2040. COAL IS CURRENTLY THE SECOND LARGEST SOURCE OF

ENERGY, BUT IT IS LIKELY TO LOSE THAT POSITION TO NATURAL GAS IN THE 2025‐2030

TIMEFRAME. THE SHARE OF NATURAL GAS IS EXPECTED TO REACH 25 PERCENT BY

2040, WHILE THE SHARE OF COAL FALLS TO ABOUT 20 PERCENT. NUCLEAR POWER IS

PROJECTED TO GROW SIGNIFICANTLY, AS MANY NATIONS ARE LIKELY TO EXPAND NUCLEAR

CAPACITY TO ADDRESS RISING ELECTRICITY NEEDS AS WELL AS ENERGY SECURITY AND

ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES. TOTAL RENEWABLE ENERGY IS LIKELY TO REACH ABOUT

15 PERCENT OF TOTAL ENERGY BY 2040, WITH BIOMASS, HYDRO AND GEOTHERMAL

CONTRIBUTING A COMBINED SHARE OF MORE THAN 10 PERCENT. TOTAL ENERGY

SUPPLIED FROM WIND, SOLAR AND BIOFUELS IS EXPECTED TO INCREASE RAPIDLY, GROWING

OVER 200 PERCENT FROM 2015 TO 2040, WHEN THEY WILL BE ABOUT 4 PERCENT

OF WORLD ENERGY.

THE

CORPORATION ANTICIPATES THAT THE WORLD’S AVAILABLE OIL AND GAS RESOURCE BASE

WILL GROW NOT ONLY FROM NEW DISCOVERIES, BUT ALSO FROM RESERVE INCREASES IN

PREVIOUSLY DISCOVERED FIELDS. TECHNOLOGY WILL UNDERPIN THESE INCREASES. THE

COST TO DEVELOP AND SUPPLY THESE RESOURCES WILL BE SIGNIFICANT. ACCORDING TO

THE INTERNATIONAL ENERGY AGENCY, THE INVESTMENT REQUIRED TO MEET OIL AND

NATURAL GAS SUPPLY REQUIREMENTS WORLDWIDE OVER THE PERIOD 2016‐2040 WILL

BE ABOUT $23 TRILLION (MEASURED IN 2015 DOLLARS) OR APPROXIMATELY

$900 BILLION PER YEAR ON AVERAGE.

INTERNATIONAL

ACCORDS AND UNDERLYING REGIONAL AND NATIONAL REGULATIONS COVERING GREENHOUSE

GAS EMISSIONS CONTINUE TO EVOLVE WITH UNCERTAIN TIMING AND OUTCOME, MAKING IT

DIFFICULT TO PREDICT THEIR BUSINESS IMPACT. FOR MANY YEARS, THE CORPORATION HAS

TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT POLICIES ESTABLISHED TO REDUCE ENERGY‐RELATED

GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS IN ITS LONG-TERM

OUTLOOK FOR ENERGY

, WHICH IS

USED AS A FOUNDATION FOR ASSESSING THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT AND BUSINESS

STRATEGIES AND INVESTMENTS. THE CLIMATE ACCORD REACHED AT THE RECENT CONFERENCE

OF THE PARTIES (COP 21) IN PARIS SET MANY NEW GOALS, AND MANY RELATED

POLICIES ARE STILL EMERGING. OUR

OUTLOOK

REFLECTS INCREASINGLY STRINGENT

CLIMATE POLICIES AND IS CONSISTENT WITH THE AGGREGATION OF NATIONALLY

DETERMINED CONTRIBUTIONS WHICH WERE SUBMITTED BY SIGNATORIES TO THE UNITED

NATIONS FRAMEWORK CONVENTION ON CLIMATE CHANGE (UNFCC) 2015 PARIS AGREEMENT.

OUR

OUTLOOK

SEEKS TO IDENTIFY POTENTIAL IMPACTS OF CLIMATE RELATED

POLICIES, WHICH OFTEN TARGET SPECIFIC SECTORS, BY USING VARIOUS ASSUMPTIONS AND

TOOLS INCLUDING APPLICATION OF A PROXY COST OF CARBON TO ESTIMATE POTENTIAL

IMPACTS ON CONSUMER DEMANDS. FOR PURPOSES OF THE

OUTLOOK

, A PROXY COST

ON ENERGY-RELATED CO

2

EMISSIONS IS ASSUMED TO REACH ABOUT $80 PER

TONNE ON AVERAGE IN 2040 IN OECD NATIONS. CHINA AND OTHER LEADING NON-OECD

NATIONS ARE EXPECTED TO TRAIL OECD POLICY INITIATIVES. NEVERTHELESS, AS PEOPLE

AND NATIONS LOOK FOR WAYS TO REDUCE RISKS OF GLOBAL CLIMATE CHANGE, THEY WILL

CONTINUE TO NEED PRACTICAL SOLUTIONS THAT DO NOT JEOPARDIZE THE AFFORDABILITY

OR RELIABILITY OF THE ENERGY THEY NEED. THUS, ALL PRACTICAL AND ECONOMICALLY

VIABLE ENERGY SOURCES, BOTH CONVENTIONAL AND UNCONVENTIONAL, WILL NEED TO BE

PURSUED TO CONTINUE MEETING GLOBAL ENERGY DEMAND, RECOGNIZING THE SCALE AND

VARIETY OF WORLDWIDE ENERGY NEEDS AS WELL AS THE IMPORTANCE OF EXPANDING ACCESS

TO MODERN ENERGY TO PROMOTE BETTER STANDARDS OF LIVING FOR BILLIONS OF PEOPLE.

THE

INFORMATION PROVIDED IN THE LONG‐TERM BUSINESS OUTLOOK INCLUDES

EXXONMOBIL’S INTERNAL ESTIMATES AND FORECASTS BASED UPON INTERNAL DATA AND

ANALYSES AS WELL AS PUBLICLY AVAILABLE INFORMATION FROM EXTERNAL SOURCES

INCLUDING THE INTERNATIONAL ENERGY AGENCY.

UPSTREAM

EXXONMOBIL

CONTINUES TO MAINTAIN A DIVERSE PORTFOLIO OF EXPLORATION AND DEVELOPMENT

OPPORTUNITIES, WHICH ENABLES THE CORPORATION TO BE SELECTIVE, MAXIMIZING

SHAREHOLDER VALUE AND MITIGATING POLITICAL AND TECHNICAL RISKS. EXXONMOBIL’S

FUNDAMENTAL UPSTREAM BUSINESS STRATEGIES GUIDE OUR GLOBAL EXPLORATION,

DEVELOPMENT, PRODUCTION, AND GAS AND POWER MARKETING ACTIVITIES. THESE

STRATEGIES INCLUDE CAPTURING MATERIAL AND ACCRETIVE OPPORTUNITIES TO

CONTINUALLY HIGH-GRADE THE RESOURCE PORTFOLIO, SELECTIVELY DEVELOPING

ATTRACTIVE OIL AND NATURAL GAS RESOURCES, DEVELOPING AND APPLYING HIGH-IMPACT

TECHNOLOGIES, AND PURSUING PRODUCTIVITY AND EFFICIENCY GAINS. THESE STRATEGIES

ARE UNDERPINNED BY A RELENTLESS FOCUS ON OPERATIONAL EXCELLENCE, DEVELOPMENT OF

OUR EMPLOYEES, AND INVESTMENT IN THE COMMUNITIES WITHIN WHICH WE OPERATE.

AS

FUTURE DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS AND DRILLING ACTIVITIES BRING NEW PRODUCTION

ONLINE, THE CORPORATION EXPECTS A SHIFT IN THE GEOGRAPHIC MIX AND IN THE TYPE

OF OPPORTUNITIES FROM WHICH VOLUMES ARE PRODUCED. OIL EQUIVALENT PRODUCTION

FROM NORTH

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

AMERICA IS EXPECTED TO INCREASE OVER THE

NEXT SEVERAL YEARS BASED ON CURRENT INVESTMENT PLANS, CONTRIBUTING OVER A THIRD

OF TOTAL PRODUCTION. FURTHER, THE PROPORTION OF OUR GLOBAL PRODUCTION FROM

RESOURCE TYPES UTILIZING SPECIALIZED TECHNOLOGIES SUCH AS ARCTIC, DEEPWATER,

UNCONVENTIONAL DRILLING AND PRODUCTION SYSTEMS AND LNG, IS A SLIGHT MAJORITY OF

PRODUCTION AND IS EXPECTED TO GROW OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS. WE DO NOT

ANTICIPATE THAT THE EXPECTED CHANGE IN THE GEOGRAPHIC MIX OF PRODUCTION

VOLUMES, AND IN THE TYPES OF OPPORTUNITIES FROM WHICH VOLUMES WILL BE PRODUCED,

WILL HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE NATURE AND THE EXTENT OF THE RISKS DISCLOSED

IN ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS, OR RESULT IN A MATERIAL CHANGE IN OUR LEVEL OF UNIT

OPERATING EXPENSES.

THE

CORPORATION ANTICIPATES SEVERAL PROJECTS WILL COME ONLINE OVER THE NEXT FEW

YEARS PROVIDING ADDITIONAL PRODUCTION CAPACITY. HOWEVER, ACTUAL VOLUMES WILL

VARY FROM YEAR TO YEAR DUE TO THE TIMING OF INDIVIDUAL PROJECT START-UPS;

OPERATIONAL OUTAGES; RESERVOIR PERFORMANCE; PERFORMANCE OF ENHANCED OIL

RECOVERY PROJECTS; REGULATORY CHANGES; THE IMPACT OF FISCAL AND COMMERCIAL

TERMS; ASSET SALES; WEATHER EVENTS; PRICE EFFECTS ON PRODUCTION SHARING

CONTRACTS; CHANGES IN THE AMOUNT AND TIMING OF CAPITAL INVESTMENTS THAT MAY

VARY DEPENDING ON THE OIL AND GAS PRICE ENVIRONMENT; AND OTHER FACTORS

DESCRIBED IN ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS.

THE

UPSTREAM INDUSTRY ENVIRONMENT HAS BEEN CHALLENGED IN RECENT YEARS WITH ABUNDANT

CRUDE OIL SUPPLY CAUSING CRUDE OIL PRICES TO DECREASE TO LEVELS NOT SEEN SINCE

2004, AND NATURAL GAS PRICES DECLINED WITH INCREASED SUPPLY. HOWEVER, CURRENT

MARKET CONDITIONS ARE NOT NECESSARILY INDICATIVE OF FUTURE CONDITIONS. THE

MARKETS FOR CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS HAVE A HISTORY OF SIGNIFICANT PRICE

VOLATILITY. EXXONMOBIL BELIEVES PRICES OVER THE LONG TERM WILL CONTINUE TO BE

DRIVEN BY MARKET SUPPLY AND DEMAND, WITH THE DEMAND SIDE LARGELY BEING A

FUNCTION OF GLOBAL ECONOMIC GROWTH. ON THE SUPPLY SIDE, PRICES MAY BE

SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACTED BY POLITICAL EVENTS, THE ACTIONS OF OPEC AND OTHER LARGE

GOVERNMENT RESOURCE OWNERS, AND OTHER FACTORS. TO MANAGE THE RISKS ASSOCIATED

WITH PRICE, EXXONMOBIL EVALUATES ANNUAL PLANS AND MAJOR INVESTMENTS ACROSS A

RANGE OF PRICE SCENARIOS.

DOWNSTREAM

EXXONMOBIL’S

DOWNSTREAM IS A LARGE, DIVERSIFIED BUSINESS WITH REFINING, LOGISTICS, AND

MARKETING COMPLEXES AROUND THE WORLD. THE CORPORATION HAS A PRESENCE IN MATURE

MARKETS IN NORTH AMERICA AND EUROPE, AS WELL AS IN THE GROWING ASIA PACIFIC

REGION.

EXXONMOBIL’S

FUNDAMENTAL DOWNSTREAM BUSINESS STRATEGIES COMPETITIVELY POSITION THE COMPANY

ACROSS A RANGE OF MARKET CONDITIONS. THESE STRATEGIES INCLUDE TARGETING BEST‐IN‐CLASS

OPERATIONS IN ALL ASPECTS OF THE BUSINESS, MAXIMIZING VALUE FROM ADVANCED

TECHNOLOGIES, CAPITALIZING ON INTEGRATION ACROSS EXXONMOBIL BUSINESSES,

SELECTIVELY INVESTING FOR RESILIENT, ADVANTAGED RETURNS, OPERATING EFFICIENTLY

AND EFFECTIVELY, AND PROVIDING QUALITY, VALUED AND DIFFERENTIATED PRODUCTS AND

SERVICES TO CUSTOMERS.

EXXONMOBIL’S

OPERATING RESULTS, AS NOTED IN ITEM 2. PROPERTIES, REFLECT 22 REFINERIES,

LOCATED IN 14 COUNTRIES, WITH DISTILLATION CAPACITY OF 4.9 MILLION

BARRELS PER DAY AND LUBRICANT BASESTOCK MANUFACTURING CAPACITY OF 126

THOUSAND BARRELS PER DAY. EXXONMOBIL’S FUELS AND LUBES MARKETING BUSINESSES

HAVE SIGNIFICANT GLOBAL REACH, WITH MULTIPLE CHANNELS TO MARKET SERVING A

DIVERSE CUSTOMER BASE. OUR PORTFOLIO OF WORLD-RENOWNED BRANDS INCLUDES

EXXON

,

MOBIL

,

ESSO

AND

MOBIL 1.

WHILE

DEMAND REMAINED STRONG IN 2016, MARGINS WEAKENED AS SURPLUS DISTILLATE AND

GASOLINE PRODUCTION CAPACITY CREATED HIGH INVENTORIES. NORTH AMERICAN

REFINERIES WHICH BENEFITED FROM COST‐COMPETITIVE FEEDSTOCK AND ENERGY

SUPPLIES SAW LOWER MARGINS AS THE DIFFERENTIAL BETWEEN BRENT AND WTI NARROWED

AFTER THE ELIMINATION OF THE U.S. CRUDE EXPORT BAN. MARGINS IN EUROPE AND ASIA

WEAKENED VERSUS 2015, BUT REDUCTIONS IN SUPPLY AND RISING ASIA DEMAND KEPT

THOSE MARKETS ABOVE BOTTOM‐OF‐CYCLE CONDITIONS SEEN IN 2014. IN THE

NEAR TERM, WE SEE VARIABILITY IN REFINING MARGINS, WITH SOME REGIONS SEEING

WEAKER MARGINS AS NEW CAPACITY ADDITIONS ARE EXPECTED TO OUTPACE GROWTH IN

GLOBAL DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS, WHICH CAN ALSO BE AFFECTED BY GLOBAL ECONOMIC

CONDITIONS AND REGULATORY CHANGES.

REFINING

MARGINS ARE LARGELY DRIVEN BY DIFFERENCES IN COMMODITY PRICES AND ARE A

FUNCTION OF THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WHAT A REFINERY PAYS FOR ITS RAW MATERIALS

(PRIMARILY CRUDE OIL) AND THE MARKET PRICES FOR THE RANGE OF PRODUCTS PRODUCED

(PRIMARILY GASOLINE, HEATING OIL, DIESEL OIL, JET FUEL AND FUEL OIL). CRUDE OIL

AND MANY PRODUCTS ARE WIDELY TRADED WITH PUBLISHED PRICES, INCLUDING THOSE

QUOTED ON MULTIPLE EXCHANGES AROUND THE WORLD (E.G., NEW YORK MERCANTILE

EXCHANGE AND INTERCONTINENTAL EXCHANGE). PRICES FOR THESE COMMODITIES ARE

DETERMINED BY THE GLOBAL MARKETPLACE AND ARE INFLUENCED BY MANY FACTORS,

INCLUDING GLOBAL AND REGIONAL SUPPLY/DEMAND BALANCES, INVENTORY LEVELS,

INDUSTRY REFINERY OPERATIONS, IMPORT/EXPORT BALANCES, CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS, SEASONAL

DEMAND, WEATHER AND POLITICAL CLIMATE.

EXXONMOBIL’S

LONG‐TERM OUTLOOK IS THAT INDUSTRY REFINING MARGINS WILL REMAIN SUBJECT

TO INTENSE COMPETITION AS NEW CAPACITY ADDITIONS OUTPACE THE GROWTH IN GLOBAL

DEMAND. EXXONMOBIL’S INTEGRATION ACROSS THE VALUE CHAIN, FROM REFINING TO

MARKETING, ENHANCES OVERALL VALUE IN BOTH FUELS AND LUBRICANTS BUSINESSES.

AS

DESCRIBED IN MORE DETAIL IN ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS, PROPOSED CARBON POLICY AND

OTHER CLIMATE‐RELATED REGULATIONS IN MANY COUNTRIES, AS WELL AS THE

CONTINUED GROWTH IN BIOFUELS MANDATES, COULD HAVE NEGATIVE IMPACTS ON THE

DOWNSTREAM BUSINESS.

IN

THE RETAIL FUELS MARKETING BUSINESS, PRODUCT COST VOLATILITY HAS CONTRIBUTED TO

A DECLINE IN MARGINS. IN 2016, EXXONMOBIL EXPANDED ITS BRANDED RETAIL SITE

NETWORK AND PROGRESSED THE MULTI‐YEAR TRANSITION OF THE DIRECT SERVED

(I.E., DEALER, COMPANY‐OPERATED) RETAIL NETWORK IN PORTIONS OF EUROPE AND

CANADA TO A MORE CAPITAL‐EFFICIENT BRANDED WHOLESALER MODEL. THE

COMPANY’S LUBRICANTS BUSINESS CONTINUES TO GROW, LEVERAGING WORLD‐CLASS

BRANDS AND INTEGRATION WITH INDUSTRY‐LEADING BASESTOCK

43

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

REFINING CAPABILITY. EXXONMOBIL REMAINS A MARKET LEADER

IN THE HIGH‐VALUE SYNTHETIC LUBRICANTS SECTOR, DESPITE INCREASING

COMPETITION.

THE

DOWNSTREAM PORTFOLIO IS CONTINUALLY EVALUATED DURING ALL PARTS OF THE BUSINESS

CYCLE, AND NUMEROUS ASSET DIVESTMENTS HAVE BEEN MADE OVER THE PAST DECADE. IN

2016, THE COMPANY DIVESTED ITS REFINERY IN TORRANCE, CALIFORNIA. WHEN INVESTING

IN THE DOWNSTREAM, EXXONMOBIL REMAINS FOCUSED ON SELECTIVE AND RESILIENT

PROJECTS. IN 2016, CONSTRUCTION CONTINUED ON A NEW DELAYED COKER UNIT AT THE

REFINERY IN ANTWERP, BELGIUM, TO UPGRADE LOW‐VALUE BUNKER FUEL INTO

HIGHER VALUE DIESEL PRODUCTS. CONSTRUCTION ALSO PROGRESSED ON A PROPRIETARY

HYDROCRACKER AT THE REFINERY IN ROTTERDAM, NETHERLANDS, TO PRODUCE HIGHER VALUE

ULTRA-LOW SULFUR DIESEL AND GROUP II BASESTOCKS. THE TAICANG, CHINA, LUBRICANTS

PLANT EXPANSION WAS COMPLETED IN APRIL 2016, DOUBLING THE CAPACITY OF THE

FACILITY. THE PORT ALLEN AVIATION LUBRICANTS PLANT IN LOUISIANA ACHIEVED FULL

PRODUCTION DURING THE YEAR, AND AN EXPANSION IN SINGAPORE IS UNDERWAY TO

SUPPORT DEMAND GROWTH FOR FINISHED LUBRICANTS IN KEY MARKETS. FINALLY, EXXONMOBIL

ANNOUNCED PLANS TO INCREASE PRODUCTION OF ULTRA-LOW SULFUR FUELS AT THE

BEAUMONT, TEXAS, REFINERY BY APPROXIMATELY 40,000 BARRELS PER DAY.

CHEMICAL

WORLDWIDE

PETROCHEMICAL DEMAND REMAINED STRONG IN 2016, LED BY GROWING DEMAND FROM ASIA

PACIFIC MANUFACTURERS OF INDUSTRIAL AND CONSUMER PRODUCTS. NORTH AMERICA

CONTINUED TO BENEFIT FROM ABUNDANT SUPPLIES OF NATURAL GAS AND GAS LIQUIDS,

PROVIDING BOTH LOW‐COST FEEDSTOCK AND ENERGY. SPECIALTY PRODUCT MARGINS

MODERATED IN 2016 WITH CAPACITY ADDITIONS EXCEEDING DEMAND GROWTH.

EXXONMOBIL

SUSTAINED ITS COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE THROUGH CONTINUED OPERATIONAL EXCELLENCE,

INVESTMENT AND COST DISCIPLINE, A BALANCED PORTFOLIO OF PRODUCTS, AND

INTEGRATION WITH REFINING AND UPSTREAM OPERATIONS, ALL UNDERPINNED BY

PROPRIETARY TECHNOLOGY.

IN

2016, WE COMPLETED STARTUP OF THE SPECIALTY ELASTOMERS PROJECT AT OUR JOINT

VENTURE FACILITY IN AL-JUBAIL, SAUDI ARABIA. CONSTRUCTION CONTINUED ON A MAJOR

EXPANSION AT OUR TEXAS FACILITIES, INCLUDING A NEW WORLD-SCALE ETHANE CRACKER

AND POLYETHYLENE LINES, TO CAPITALIZE ON LOW-COST FEEDSTOCK AND ENERGY SUPPLIES

IN NORTH AMERICA AND TO MEET RAPIDLY GROWING DEMAND FOR PREMIUM POLYMERS.

CONSTRUCTION OF NEW HALOBUTYL RUBBER AND HYDROCARBON RESIN UNITS ALSO

PROGRESSED IN SINGAPORE TO FURTHER EXTEND OUR SPECIALTY PRODUCT CAPACITY IN

ASIA PACIFIC. THE COMPANY ALSO ANNOUNCED PLANS TO EXPAND ITS POLYETHYLENE PLANT

IN BEAUMONT, TEXAS, AND SPECIALTY ELASTOMERS PLANT IN NEWPORT, WALES.

CREDIT OF $5.5 BILLION AND UNUSED COMMITTED LONG-TERM LINES OF CREDIT OF

$0.3 BILLION. CASH THAT MAY BE TEMPORARILY AVAILABLE AS SURPLUS TO THE

CORPORATION’S IMMEDIATE NEEDS IS CAREFULLY MANAGED THROUGH COUNTERPARTY QUALITY

AND INVESTMENT GUIDELINES TO ENSURE IT IS SECURE AND READILY AVAILABLE TO MEET

THE CORPORATION’S CASH REQUIREMENTS AND TO OPTIMIZE RETURNS.

TO

SUPPORT CASH FLOWS IN FUTURE PERIODS THE CORPORATION WILL NEED TO CONTINUALLY

FIND AND DEVELOP NEW FIELDS, AND CONTINUE TO DEVELOP AND APPLY NEW TECHNOLOGIES

AND RECOVERY PROCESSES TO EXISTING FIELDS, IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN OR INCREASE

PRODUCTION. AFTER A PERIOD OF PRODUCTION AT PLATEAU RATES, IT IS THE NATURE OF

OIL AND GAS FIELDS EVENTUALLY TO PRODUCE AT DECLINING RATES FOR THE REMAINDER

OF THEIR ECONOMIC LIFE. AVERAGED OVER ALL THE CORPORATION’S EXISTING OIL AND

GAS FIELDS AND WITHOUT NEW PROJECTS, EXXONMOBIL’S PRODUCTION IS EXPECTED TO

DECLINE AT AN AVERAGE OF APPROXIMATELY 3 PERCENT PER YEAR OVER THE NEXT FEW

YEARS. DECLINE RATES CAN VARY WIDELY BY INDIVIDUAL FIELD DUE TO A NUMBER OF

FACTORS, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE TYPE OF RESERVOIR, FLUID

PROPERTIES, RECOVERY MECHANISMS, WORK ACTIVITY, AND AGE OF THE FIELD.

FURTHERMORE, THE CORPORATION’S NET INTEREST IN PRODUCTION FOR INDIVIDUAL FIELDS

CAN VARY WITH PRICE AND THE IMPACT OF FISCAL AND COMMERCIAL TERMS.

THE

CORPORATION HAS LONG BEEN SUCCESSFUL AT OFFSETTING THE EFFECTS OF NATURAL FIELD

DECLINE THROUGH DISCIPLINED INVESTMENTS IN QUALITY OPPORTUNITIES AND PROJECT

EXECUTION. THE CORPORATION ANTICIPATES SEVERAL PROJECTS WILL COME ONLINE OVER

THE NEXT FEW YEARS PROVIDING ADDITIONAL PRODUCTION CAPACITY. HOWEVER, ACTUAL

VOLUMES WILL VARY FROM YEAR TO YEAR DUE TO THE TIMING OF INDIVIDUAL PROJECT

START‐UPS; OPERATIONAL OUTAGES; RESERVOIR PERFORMANCE; PERFORMANCE OF

ENHANCED OIL RECOVERY PROJECTS; REGULATORY CHANGES; THE IMPACT OF FISCAL AND

COMMERCIAL TERMS; ASSET SALES; WEATHER EVENTS; PRICE EFFECTS ON PRODUCTION

SHARING CONTRACTS; AND CHANGES IN THE AMOUNT AND TIMING OF INVESTMENTS THAT MAY

VARY DEPENDING ON THE OIL AND GAS PRICE ENVIRONMENT. THE CORPORATION’S CASH

FLOWS ARE ALSO HIGHLY DEPENDENT ON CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS PRICES. PLEASE

REFER TO ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS FOR A MORE COMPLETE DISCUSSION OF RISKS.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

THE CORPORATION’S FINANCIAL STRENGTH

ENABLES IT TO MAKE LARGE, LONG-TERM CAPITAL EXPENDITURES. CAPITAL AND

EXPLORATION EXPENDITURES IN 2016 WERE $19.3 BILLION, REFLECTING THE

CORPORATION’S CONTINUED ACTIVE INVESTMENT PROGRAM. THE CORPORATION ANTICIPATES

AN INVESTMENT LEVEL OF $22 BILLION IN 2017. THE CORPORATION IS EMERGING FROM

SEVERAL YEARS OF HIGH CAPITAL EXPENDITURE LEVELS THAT SUPPORTED MAJOR

LONG-PLATEAU PRODUCTION PROJECTS COMING ON LINE. LOWER LEVELS OF CAPITAL

SPENDING OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS, PARTLY DUE TO COST SAVINGS AND CAPITAL

EFFICIENCIES, ARE NOT EXPECTED TO DELAY MAJOR PROJECT SCHEDULES NOR HAVE A

MATERIAL EFFECT ON OUR VOLUME CAPACITY OUTLOOK.

ACTUAL

SPENDING COULD VARY DEPENDING ON THE PROGRESS OF INDIVIDUAL PROJECTS AND

PROPERTY ACQUISITIONS. THE CORPORATION HAS A LARGE AND DIVERSE PORTFOLIO OF DEVELOPMENT

PROJECTS AND EXPLORATION OPPORTUNITIES, WHICH HELPS MITIGATE THE OVERALL

POLITICAL AND TECHNICAL RISKS OF THE CORPORATION’S UPSTREAM SEGMENT AND

ASSOCIATED CASH FLOW. FURTHER, DUE TO ITS FINANCIAL STRENGTH, DEBT CAPACITY AND

DIVERSE PORTFOLIO OF OPPORTUNITIES, THE RISK ASSOCIATED WITH FAILURE OR DELAY

OF ANY SINGLE PROJECT WOULD NOT HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE CORPORATION’S

LIQUIDITY OR ABILITY TO GENERATE SUFFICIENT CASH FLOWS FOR OPERATIONS AND ITS

FIXED COMMITMENTS.

CASH FLOW FROM

OPERATING ACTIVITIES

2016

CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES

TOTALED $22.1 BILLION IN 2016, $8.3 BILLION LOWER THAN 2015. THE MAJOR SOURCE

OF FUNDS WAS NET INCOME INCLUDING NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS OF $8.4 BILLION, A

DECREASE OF $8.2 BILLION. THE NONCASH PROVISION FOR DEPRECIATION AND DEPLETION

WAS $22.3 BILLION, UP $4.3 BILLION FROM THE PRIOR YEAR. THE ADJUSTMENT FOR NET

GAINS ON ASSET SALES WAS $1.7 BILLION WHILE THE ADJUSTMENT FOR DEFERRED INCOME

TAX CREDITS WAS $4.4 BILLION. CHANGES IN OPERATIONAL WORKING CAPITAL, EXCLUDING

CASH AND DEBT, DECREASED CASH IN 2016 BY $1.4 BILLION.

2015

CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES

TOTALED $30.3 BILLION IN 2015, $14.8 BILLION LOWER THAN 2014. THE MAJOR SOURCE

OF FUNDS WAS NET INCOME INCLUDING NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS OF $16.6 BILLION, A

DECREASE OF $17.1 BILLION. THE NONCASH PROVISION FOR DEPRECIATION AND DEPLETION

WAS $18.0 BILLION, UP $0.8 BILLION FROM THE PRIOR YEAR. THE ADJUSTMENT FOR NET

GAINS ON ASSET SALES WAS $0.2 BILLION COMPARED TO AN ADJUSTMENT OF $3.2 BILLION

IN 2014. CHANGES IN OPERATIONAL WORKING CAPITAL, EXCLUDING CASH AND DEBT, DECREASED

CASH IN 2015 BY $3.1 BILLION.

CASH FLOW FROM

INVESTING ACTIVITIES

2016

CASH USED IN

INVESTMENT ACTIVITIES NETTED TO $12.4 BILLION IN 2016, $11.4 BILLION LOWER THAN

2015. SPENDING FOR PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT OF $16.2 BILLION DECREASED

$10.3 BILLION FROM 2015. PROCEEDS ASSOCIATED WITH SALES OF SUBSIDIARIES,

PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT, AND SALES AND RETURNS OF INVESTMENTS OF $4.3

BILLION COMPARED TO $2.4 BILLION IN 2015. ADDITIONAL INVESTMENTS AND ADVANCES

WERE $0.8 BILLION HIGHER IN 2016.

2015

CASH USED IN INVESTMENT ACTIVITIES NETTED TO $23.8 BILLION

IN 2015, $3.2 BILLION LOWER THAN 2014. SPENDING FOR PROPERTY, PLANT AND

EQUIPMENT OF $26.5 BILLION DECREASED $6.5 BILLION FROM 2014. PROCEEDS

ASSOCIATED WITH SALES OF SUBSIDIARIES, PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT, AND SALES

AND RETURNS OF INVESTMENTS OF $2.4 BILLION COMPARED TO $4.0 BILLION IN 2014.

ADDITIONAL INVESTMENTS AND ADVANCES WERE $1.0 BILLION LOWER IN 2015, WHILE

COLLECTION OF ADVANCES WAS $2.5 BILLION LOWER IN 2015.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

CASH FLOW FROM FINANCING ACTIVITIES

2016

CASH

USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES WAS $9.3 BILLION IN 2016, $2.3 BILLION HIGHER THAN

2015. DIVIDEND PAYMENTS ON COMMON SHARES INCREASED TO $2.98 PER SHARE FROM

$2.88 PER SHARE AND TOTALED $12.5 BILLION. TOTAL DEBT INCREASED $4.1 BILLION TO

$42.8 BILLION AT YEAR‐END. THE FIRST QUARTER ISSUANCE OF $12.0 BILLION IN

LONG-TERM DEBT WAS PARTLY OFFSET BY REPAYMENTS OF $8.0 BILLION IN COMMERCIAL

PAPER AND OTHER SHORT-TERM DEBT DURING THE YEAR.

EXXONMOBIL

SHARE OF EQUITY DECREASED $3.5 BILLION TO $167.3 BILLION. THE ADDITION TO

EQUITY FOR EARNINGS WAS $7.8 BILLION. THIS WAS OFFSET BY REDUCTIONS FOR

DISTRIBUTIONS TO EXXONMOBIL SHAREHOLDERS OF $12.5 BILLION, ALL IN THE FORM OF

DIVIDENDS. FOREIGN EXCHANGE TRANSLATION EFFECTS OF $0.3 BILLION FOR THE

STRONGER U.S. CURRENCY REDUCED EQUITY, WHILE A $1.6 BILLION CHANGE IN THE

FUNDED STATUS OF THE POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS RESERVES INCREASED EQUITY.

DURING 2016, EXXON MOBIL CORPORATION ACQUIRED

12 MILLION SHARES OF ITS COMMON STOCK FOR THE TREASURY AT A GROSS COST OF

$1.0 BILLION. THESE PURCHASES WERE MADE TO OFFSET SHARES OR UNITS SETTLED

IN SHARES ISSUED IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE COMPANY’S BENEFIT PLANS AND PROGRAMS.

SHARES OUTSTANDING WERE REDUCED FROM 4,156 MILLION TO 4,148 MILLION AT THE END

OF 2016.

2015

CASH

USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES WAS $7.0 BILLION IN 2015, $10.9 BILLION LOWER THAN

2014. DIVIDEND PAYMENTS ON COMMON SHARES INCREASED TO $2.88 PER SHARE FROM

$2.70 PER SHARE AND TOTALED $12.1 BILLION, A PAY-OUT OF 75 PERCENT OF NET

INCOME. DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2015, THE CORPORATION ISSUED $8.0 BILLION

OF LONG-TERM DEBT. TOTAL DEBT INCREASED $9.6 BILLION TO $38.7 BILLION AT YEAR‐END.

EXXONMOBIL

SHARE OF EQUITY DECREASED $3.6 BILLION TO $170.8 BILLION. THE ADDITION TO

EQUITY FOR EARNINGS WAS $16.2 BILLION. THIS WAS OFFSET BY REDUCTIONS FOR

DISTRIBUTIONS TO EXXONMOBIL SHAREHOLDERS OF $15.1 BILLION, COMPOSED OF $12.1

BILLION IN DIVIDENDS AND $3.0 BILLION OF SHARE PURCHASES OF EXXONMOBIL STOCK TO

REDUCE SHARES OUTSTANDING. FOREIGN EXCHANGE TRANSLATION EFFECTS OF

$8.2 BILLION FOR THE STRONGER U.S. CURRENCY REDUCED EQUITY, WHILE A $3.6

BILLION CHANGE IN THE FUNDED STATUS OF THE POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS RESERVES

INCREASED EQUITY.

DURING 2015, EXXON MOBIL CORPORATION

ACQUIRED 48 MILLION SHARES OF ITS COMMON STOCK FOR THE TREASURY AT A GROSS COST

OF $4.0 BILLION. THESE PURCHASES WERE TO REDUCE THE NUMBER OF SHARES

OUTSTANDING AND TO OFFSET SHARES OR UNITS SETTLED IN SHARES ISSUED IN

CONJUNCTION WITH COMPANY BENEFIT PLANS AND PROGRAMS. SHARES OUTSTANDING WERE

REDUCED BY 1.1 PERCENT FROM 4,201 MILLION TO 4,156 MILLION AT THE END OF 2015.

PURCHASES WERE MADE IN BOTH THE OPEN MARKET AND THROUGH NEGOTIATED

TRANSACTIONS. PURCHASES MAY BE INCREASED, DECREASED OR DISCONTINUED AT ANY TIME

WITHOUT PRIOR NOTICE.

FIXED OR MINIMUM PRICE) WHICH ARE RESOLD SHORTLY AFTER PURCHASE, EITHER IN AN

ACTIVE, HIGHLY LIQUID MARKET OR UNDER LONG-TERM, UNCONDITIONAL SALES CONTRACTS

WITH SIMILAR PRICING TERMS. EXAMPLES INCLUDE LONG-TERM, NONCANCELABLE LNG AND

NATURAL GAS PURCHASE COMMITMENTS AND COMMITMENTS TO PURCHASE REFINERY PRODUCTS

AT MARKET PRICES. INCLUSION OF SUCH COMMITMENTS WOULD NOT BE MEANINGFUL IN

ASSESSING LIQUIDITY AND CASH FLOW, BECAUSE THESE PURCHASES WILL BE OFFSET IN

THE SAME PERIODS BY CASH RECEIVED FROM THE RELATED SALES TRANSACTIONS. THE

TABLE ALSO EXCLUDES UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS TOTALING $9.5 BILLION AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2016, BECAUSE THE CORPORATION IS UNABLE TO MAKE REASONABLY

RELIABLE ESTIMATES OF THE TIMING OF CASH SETTLEMENTS WITH THE RESPECTIVE TAXING

AUTHORITIES. FURTHER DETAILS ON THE UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS CAN BE FOUND IN “NOTE

19: INCOME, SALES-BASED AND OTHER TAXES”.

NOTES.

(1)   INCLUDES CAPITALIZED LEASE

OBLIGATIONS OF $1,225 MILLION.

(2)   THE AMOUNT DUE IN ONE YEAR IS

INCLUDED IN NOTES AND LOANS PAYABLE OF $13,830 MILLION.

(3)   THE FAIR VALUE OF ASSET RETIREMENT

OBLIGATIONS, PRIMARILY UPSTREAM ASSET REMOVAL COSTS AT THE COMPLETION OF FIELD

LIFE.

(4)   THE AMOUNT BY WHICH THE BENEFIT

OBLIGATIONS EXCEEDED THE FAIR VALUE OF FUND ASSETS FOR CERTAIN U.S. AND

NON-U.S. PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT PLANS AT YEAR-END. THE PAYMENTS BY

PERIOD INCLUDE EXPECTED CONTRIBUTIONS TO FUNDED PENSION PLANS IN 2017 AND

ESTIMATED BENEFIT PAYMENTS FOR UNFUNDED PLANS IN ALL YEARS.

(5)   MINIMUM COMMITMENTS FOR OPERATING

LEASES, SHOWN ON AN UNDISCOUNTED BASIS, COVER DRILLING EQUIPMENT, TANKERS,

SERVICE STATIONS AND OTHER PROPERTIES. TOTAL INCLUDES $836 MILLION RELATED TO

DRILLING RIGS AND RELATED EQUIPMENT.

(6)   TAKE-OR-PAY OBLIGATIONS ARE

NONCANCELABLE, LONG-TERM COMMITMENTS FOR GOODS AND SERVICES. UNCONDITIONAL

PURCHASE OBLIGATIONS ARE THOSE LONG-TERM COMMITMENTS THAT ARE NONCANCELABLE OR

CANCELABLE ONLY UNDER CERTAIN CONDITIONS, AND THAT THIRD PARTIES HAVE USED TO

SECURE FINANCING FOR THE FACILITIES THAT WILL PROVIDE THE CONTRACTED GOODS OR

SERVICES. THE UNDISCOUNTED OBLIGATIONS OF $21,580 MILLION MAINLY PERTAIN TO

PIPELINE, MANUFACTURING SUPPLY AND TERMINAL AGREEMENTS.

(7)   FIRM CAPITAL COMMITMENTS REPRESENT

LEGALLY BINDING PAYMENT OBLIGATIONS TO THIRD PARTIES WHERE AGREEMENTS

SPECIFYING ALL SIGNIFICANT TERMS HAVE BEEN EXECUTED FOR THE CONSTRUCTION AND

PURCHASE OF FIXED ASSETS AND OTHER PERMANENT INVESTMENTS. IN CERTAIN CASES

WHERE THE CORPORATION EXECUTES CONTRACTS REQUIRING COMMITMENTS TO A WORK SCOPE,

THOSE COMMITMENTS HAVE BEEN INCLUDED TO THE EXTENT THAT THE AMOUNTS AND TIMING

OF PAYMENTS CAN BE RELIABLY ESTIMATED. FIRM CAPITAL COMMITMENTS, SHOWN ON AN

UNDISCOUNTED BASIS, TOTALED $10.4 BILLION, INCLUDING $2.8 BILLION IN THE U.S.

FIRM CAPITAL COMMITMENTS FOR THE NON-U.S. UPSTREAM OF $6.9 BILLION WERE

PRIMARILY ASSOCIATED WITH PROJECTS IN THE UNITED ARAB EMIRATES, AFRICA,

MALAYSIA, CANADA, AUSTRALIA AND NORWAY. THE CORPORATION EXPECTS TO FUND THE

MAJORITY OF THESE COMMITMENTS WITH INTERNALLY GENERATED FUNDS, SUPPLEMENTED BY

LONG-TERM AND SHORT-TERM DEBT.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

GUARANTEES

THE

CORPORATION AND CERTAIN OF ITS CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES WERE CONTINGENTLY

LIABLE AT DECEMBER 31, 2016, FOR GUARANTEES RELATING TO NOTES, LOANS AND

PERFORMANCE UNDER CONTRACTS (NOTE 16). WHERE GUARANTEES FOR ENVIRONMENTAL

REMEDIATION AND OTHER SIMILAR MATTERS DO NOT INCLUDE A STATED CAP, THE AMOUNTS

REFLECT MANAGEMENT’S ESTIMATE OF THE MAXIMUM POTENTIAL EXPOSURE. THESE GUARANTEES

ARE NOT REASONABLY LIKELY TO HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE CORPORATION’S

FINANCIAL CONDITION, CHANGES IN FINANCIAL CONDITION, REVENUES OR EXPENSES,

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, LIQUIDITY, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES OR CAPITAL RESOURCES.

FINANCIAL STRENGTH

ON DECEMBER 31, 2016, THE

CORPORATION’S UNUSED SHORT-TERM COMMITTED LINES OF CREDIT TOTALED $5.5 BILLION

(NOTE 6) AND UNUSED LONG-TERM COMMITTED LINES OF CREDIT TOTALED $0.3 BILLION

(NOTE 14). THE TABLE BELOW SHOWS THE CORPORATION’S FIXED-CHARGE COVERAGE

MANAGEMENT

VIEWS THE CORPORATION’S FINANCIAL STRENGTH, AS EVIDENCED BY THE ABOVE FINANCIAL

RATIOS AND OTHER SIMILAR MEASURES, TO BE A COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE OF STRATEGIC

IMPORTANCE. THE CORPORATION’S SOUND FINANCIAL POSITION GIVES IT THE OPPORTUNITY

TO ACCESS THE WORLD’S CAPITAL MARKETS IN THE FULL RANGE OF MARKET CONDITIONS,

AND ENABLES THE CORPORATION TO TAKE ON LARGE, LONG-TERM CAPITAL COMMITMENTS IN

THE PURSUIT OF MAXIMIZING SHAREHOLDER VALUE.

LITIGATION AND OTHER CONTINGENCIES

AS

DISCUSSED IN NOTE 16, A VARIETY OF CLAIMS HAVE BEEN MADE AGAINST EXXONMOBIL AND

CERTAIN OF ITS CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES IN A NUMBER OF PENDING LAWSUITS. BASED

ON A CONSIDERATION OF ALL RELEVANT FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES, THE CORPORATION

DOES NOT BELIEVE THE ULTIMATE OUTCOME OF ANY CURRENTLY PENDING LAWSUIT AGAINST

EXXONMOBIL WILL HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT UPON THE CORPORATION’S

OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, OR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS TAKEN AS A WHOLE.

THERE ARE NO EVENTS OR UNCERTAINTIES BEYOND THOSE ALREADY INCLUDED IN REPORTED

FINANCIAL INFORMATION THAT WOULD INDICATE A MATERIAL CHANGE IN FUTURE OPERATING

RESULTS OR FINANCIAL CONDITION. REFER TO NOTE 16 FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND OTHER CONTINGENCIES.

CAPITAL

AND EXPLORATION EXPENDITURES IN 2016 WERE $19.3 BILLION, AS THE CORPORATION

CONTINUED TO PURSUE OPPORTUNITIES TO FIND AND PRODUCE NEW SUPPLIES OF OIL AND

NATURAL GAS TO MEET GLOBAL DEMAND FOR ENERGY. THE CORPORATION ANTICIPATES AN INVESTMENT

LEVEL OF $22 BILLION IN 2017. ACTUAL SPENDING COULD VARY DEPENDING ON THE

PROGRESS OF INDIVIDUAL PROJECTS AND PROPERTY ACQUISITIONS.

UPSTREAM

SPENDING OF $14.5 BILLION IN 2016 WAS DOWN 43 PERCENT FROM 2015, REFLECTING KEY

PROJECT START-UPS AND CAPITAL EFFICIENCIES. INVESTMENTS IN 2016 INCLUDED U.S.

ONSHORE DRILLING AND WORLD-CLASS PROJECTS IN KAZAKHSTAN, CANADA AND AUSTRALIA. THE

MAJORITY OF EXPENDITURES ARE ON DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS, WHICH TYPICALLY TAKE TWO

TO FOUR YEARS FROM THE TIME OF RECORDING PROVED UNDEVELOPED RESERVES TO THE

START OF PRODUCTION. THE PERCENTAGE OF PROVED DEVELOPED RESERVES WAS 69 PERCENT

OF TOTAL PROVED RESERVES AT YEAR‐END 2016, AND HAS BEEN OVER 60 PERCENT

FOR THE LAST TEN YEARS.

CAPITAL INVESTMENTS IN THE DOWNSTREAM

TOTALED $2.5 BILLION IN 2016, A DECREASE OF $0.2 BILLION FROM 2015, MAINLY

REFLECTING LOWER REFINING PROJECT SPENDING. CHEMICAL CAPITAL EXPENDITURES OF $2.2

BILLION DECREASED $0.6 BILLION FROM 2015 RESULTING FROM PROGRESSION OF MAJOR

EXPANSIONS.

FROM 2015. INCOME TAX EXPENSE, BOTH CURRENT AND DEFERRED, WAS A CREDIT OF $0.4 BILLION,

$5.8 BILLION LOWER THAN 2015, REFLECTING LOWER PRE-TAX INCOME. THE EFFECTIVE

TAX RATE, WHICH IS CALCULATED BASED ON CONSOLIDATED COMPANY INCOME TAXES AND

EXXONMOBIL’S SHARE OF EQUITY COMPANY INCOME TAXES, WAS 13 PERCENT COMPARED TO 34

PERCENT IN THE PRIOR YEAR DUE PRIMARILY TO A LOWER SHARE OF EARNINGS IN HIGHER

TAX JURISDICTIONS, FAVORABLE ONE-TIME ITEMS, AND THE IMPACT OF THE U.S.

UPSTREAM IMPAIRMENT CHARGE. SALES‐BASED AND ALL OTHER TAXES AND DUTIES OF

$49.4 BILLION IN 2016 DECREASED $3.1 BILLION.

2015

INCOME,

SALES-BASED AND ALL OTHER TAXES AND DUTIES TOTALED $57.9 BILLION IN 2015, A DECREASE

OF $25.0 BILLION OR 30 PERCENT FROM 2014. INCOME TAX EXPENSE, BOTH CURRENT AND

DEFERRED, WAS $5.4 BILLION, $12.6 BILLION LOWER THAN 2014, AS A RESULT OF LOWER

EARNINGS AND A LOWER EFFECTIVE TAX RATE. THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE WAS 34 PERCENT

COMPARED TO 41 PERCENT IN THE PRIOR YEAR DUE PRIMARILY TO A LOWER SHARE OF

EARNINGS IN HIGHER TAX JURISDICTIONS. SALES-BASED AND ALL OTHER TAXES AND

DUTIES OF $52.5 BILLION IN 2015 DECREASED $12.4 BILLION AS A RESULT

OF LOWER SALES REALIZATIONS.

THROUGHOUT

EXXONMOBIL’S BUSINESSES, NEW AND ONGOING MEASURES ARE TAKEN TO PREVENT AND

MINIMIZE THE IMPACT OF OUR OPERATIONS ON AIR, WATER AND GROUND. THESE

INCLUDE A SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT IN REFINING INFRASTRUCTURE AND TECHNOLOGY TO

MANUFACTURE CLEAN FUELS, AS WELL AS PROJECTS TO MONITOR AND REDUCE

NITROGEN OXIDE, SULFUR OXIDE AND GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS, AND EXPENDITURES FOR

ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS. USING DEFINITIONS AND GUIDELINES ESTABLISHED BY

THE AMERICAN PETROLEUM INSTITUTE, EXXONMOBIL’S 2016 WORLDWIDE ENVIRONMENTAL

EXPENDITURES FOR ALL SUCH PREVENTATIVE AND REMEDIATION STEPS, INCLUDING EXXONMOBIL’S

SHARE OF EQUITY COMPANY EXPENDITURES, WERE $4.9 BILLION, OF WHICH $3.5 BILLION

WERE INCLUDED IN EXPENSES WITH THE REMAINDER IN CAPITAL EXPENDITURES. THE TOTAL

COST FOR SUCH ACTIVITIES IS EXPECTED TO REMAIN RELATIVELY FLAT AT APPROXIMATELY

$5 BILLION IN 2017 AND 2018. CAPITAL EXPENDITURES ARE EXPECTED TO ACCOUNT

FOR APPROXIMATELY 30 PERCENT OF THE TOTAL.

ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES

THE CORPORATION ACCRUES ENVIRONMENTAL

LIABILITIES WHEN IT IS PROBABLE THAT OBLIGATIONS HAVE BEEN INCURRED AND THE

AMOUNTS CAN BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED. THIS POLICY APPLIES TO ASSETS OR

BUSINESSES CURRENTLY OWNED OR PREVIOUSLY DISPOSED. EXXONMOBIL HAS ACCRUED

LIABILITIES FOR PROBABLE ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION OBLIGATIONS AT VARIOUS

SITES, INCLUDING MULTIPARTY SITES WHERE THE U.S. ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION

AGENCY HAS IDENTIFIED EXXONMOBIL AS ONE OF THE POTENTIALLY RESPONSIBLE PARTIES.

THE INVOLVEMENT OF OTHER FINANCIALLY RESPONSIBLE COMPANIES AT THESE MULTIPARTY

SITES COULD MITIGATE EXXONMOBIL’S ACTUAL JOINT AND SEVERAL LIABILITY EXPOSURE.

AT PRESENT, NO INDIVIDUAL SITE IS EXPECTED TO HAVE LOSSES MATERIAL TO

EXXONMOBIL’S OPERATIONS OR FINANCIAL CONDITION. CONSOLIDATED COMPANY PROVISIONS

MADE IN 2016 FOR ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES WERE $665 MILLION ($371 MILLION

IN 2015) AND THE BALANCE SHEET REFLECTS ACCUMULATED LIABILITIES OF $852 MILLION

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2016, AND $837 MILLION AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2015.

CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES.

CRUDE

OIL, NATURAL GAS, PETROLEUM PRODUCT AND CHEMICAL PRICES HAVE FLUCTUATED IN

RESPONSE TO CHANGING MARKET FORCES. THE IMPACTS OF THESE PRICE FLUCTUATIONS ON

EARNINGS FROM UPSTREAM, DOWNSTREAM AND CHEMICAL OPERATIONS HAVE VARIED. IN THE

UPSTREAM, A $1 PER BARREL CHANGE IN THE WEIGHTED-AVERAGE REALIZED

PRICE OF OIL WOULD HAVE APPROXIMATELY A $400 MILLION ANNUAL AFTER-TAX EFFECT ON

UPSTREAM CONSOLIDATED PLUS EQUITY COMPANY EARNINGS. SIMILARLY, A $0.10 PER THOUSAND

CUBIC FEET CHANGE IN THE WORLDWIDE AVERAGE GAS REALIZATION WOULD HAVE APPROXIMATELY

A $150 MILLION ANNUAL AFTER-TAX EFFECT ON UPSTREAM CONSOLIDATED PLUS EQUITY

COMPANY EARNINGS. FOR ANY GIVEN PERIOD, THE EXTENT OF ACTUAL BENEFIT OR

DETRIMENT WILL BE DEPENDENT ON THE PRICE MOVEMENTS OF INDIVIDUAL TYPES OF CRUDE

OIL, TAXES AND OTHER GOVERNMENT TAKE IMPACTS, PRICE ADJUSTMENT LAGS IN

LONG-TERM GAS CONTRACTS, AND CRUDE AND GAS PRODUCTION VOLUMES. ACCORDINGLY,

CHANGES IN BENCHMARK PRICES FOR CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS ONLY PROVIDE BROAD

INDICATORS OF CHANGES IN THE EARNINGS EXPERIENCED IN ANY PARTICULAR PERIOD.

IN

THE VERY COMPETITIVE DOWNSTREAM AND CHEMICAL ENVIRONMENTS, EARNINGS ARE

PRIMARILY DETERMINED BY MARGIN CAPTURE RATHER THAN ABSOLUTE PRICE LEVELS OF

PRODUCTS SOLD. REFINING MARGINS ARE A FUNCTION OF THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WHAT A

REFINER PAYS FOR ITS RAW MATERIALS (PRIMARILY CRUDE OIL) AND THE MARKET PRICES

FOR THE RANGE OF PRODUCTS PRODUCED. THESE PRICES IN TURN DEPEND ON GLOBAL AND

REGIONAL SUPPLY/DEMAND BALANCES, INVENTORY LEVELS, REFINERY OPERATIONS,

IMPORT/EXPORT BALANCES AND WEATHER.

55

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

THE GLOBAL

ENERGY MARKETS CAN GIVE RISE TO EXTENDED PERIODS IN WHICH MARKET CONDITIONS ARE

ADVERSE TO ONE OR MORE OF THE CORPORATION’S BUSINESSES. SUCH CONDITIONS, ALONG

WITH THE CAPITAL-INTENSIVE NATURE OF THE INDUSTRY AND VERY LONG LEAD TIMES

ASSOCIATED WITH MANY OF OUR PROJECTS, UNDERSCORE THE IMPORTANCE OF MAINTAINING

A STRONG FINANCIAL POSITION. MANAGEMENT VIEWS THE CORPORATION’S FINANCIAL

STRENGTH AS A COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE.

IN

GENERAL, SEGMENT RESULTS ARE NOT DEPENDENT ON THE ABILITY TO SELL AND/OR

PURCHASE PRODUCTS TO/FROM OTHER SEGMENTS. INSTEAD, WHERE SUCH SALES TAKE PLACE,

THEY ARE THE RESULT OF EFFICIENCIES AND COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGES OF INTEGRATED

REFINERY/CHEMICAL COMPLEXES. ADDITIONALLY, INTERSEGMENT SALES ARE AT

MARKET-BASED PRICES. THE PRODUCTS BOUGHT AND SOLD BETWEEN SEGMENTS CAN ALSO BE

ACQUIRED IN WORLDWIDE MARKETS THAT HAVE SUBSTANTIAL LIQUIDITY, CAPACITY AND

TRANSPORTATION CAPABILITIES. ABOUT 35 PERCENT OF THE CORPORATION’S INTERSEGMENT

SALES REPRESENT UPSTREAM PRODUCTION SOLD TO THE DOWNSTREAM. OTHER INTERSEGMENT

SALES INCLUDE THOSE BETWEEN REFINERIES AND CHEMICAL PLANTS RELATED TO RAW

MATERIALS, FEEDSTOCKS AND FINISHED PRODUCTS.

ALTHOUGH

PRICE LEVELS OF CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS MAY RISE OR FALL SIGNIFICANTLY OVER

THE SHORT TO MEDIUM TERM DUE TO GLOBAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, POLITICAL EVENTS, DECISIONS

BY OPEC AND OTHER MAJOR GOVERNMENT RESOURCE OWNERS AND OTHER FACTORS, INDUSTRY

ECONOMICS OVER THE LONG TERM WILL CONTINUE TO BE DRIVEN BY MARKET SUPPLY AND

DEMAND. ACCORDINGLY, THE CORPORATION EVALUATES THE VIABILITY OF ITS MAJOR INVESTMENTS

OVER A RANGE OF PRICES.

THE

CORPORATION HAS AN ACTIVE ASSET MANAGEMENT PROGRAM IN WHICH UNDERPERFORMING

ASSETS ARE EITHER IMPROVED TO ACCEPTABLE LEVELS OR CONSIDERED FOR DIVESTMENT.

THE ASSET MANAGEMENT PROGRAM INCLUDES A DISCIPLINED, REGULAR REVIEW TO ENSURE

THAT ALL ASSETS ARE CONTRIBUTING TO THE CORPORATION’S STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES

RESULTING IN AN EFFICIENT CAPITAL BASE.

RISK MANAGEMENT

THE

CORPORATION’S SIZE, STRONG CAPITAL STRUCTURE, GEOGRAPHIC DIVERSITY AND THE

COMPLEMENTARY NATURE OF THE UPSTREAM, DOWNSTREAM AND CHEMICAL BUSINESSES REDUCE

THE CORPORATION’S ENTERPRISE-WIDE RISK FROM CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES, CURRENCY

RATES AND COMMODITY PRICES. AS A RESULT, THE CORPORATION MAKES LIMITED USE OF

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS TO MITIGATE THE IMPACT OF SUCH CHANGES. WITH RESPECT TO

DERIVATIVES ACTIVITIES, THE CORPORATION BELIEVES THAT THERE ARE NO MATERIAL

MARKET OR CREDIT RISKS TO THE CORPORATION’S FINANCIAL POSITION, RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS OR LIQUIDITY AS A RESULT OF THE DERIVATIVES DESCRIBED IN NOTE 13.

THE CORPORATION DOES NOT ENGAGE IN SPECULATIVE DERIVATIVE ACTIVITIES OR

DERIVATIVE TRADING ACTIVITIES NOR DOES IT USE DERIVATIVES WITH LEVERAGED

FEATURES. CREDIT RISK ASSOCIATED WITH THE CORPORATION’S DERIVATIVE POSITION IS

MITIGATED BY SEVERAL FACTORS, INCLUDING THE USE OF DERIVATIVE CLEARING

EXCHANGES AND THE QUALITY OF AND FINANCIAL LIMITS PLACED ON DERIVATIVE

COUNTERPARTIES. THE CORPORATION MAINTAINS A SYSTEM OF CONTROLS THAT INCLUDES

THE AUTHORIZATION, REPORTING AND MONITORING OF DERIVATIVE ACTIVITY.

THE

CORPORATION IS EXPOSED TO CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES, PRIMARILY ON ITS SHORT-TERM

DEBT AND THE PORTION OF LONG-TERM DEBT THAT CARRIES FLOATING INTEREST RATES.

THE IMPACT OF A 100-BASIS-POINT CHANGE IN INTEREST RATES AFFECTING THE

CORPORATION’S DEBT WOULD NOT BE MATERIAL TO EARNINGS, CASH FLOW OR FAIR VALUE. THE

CORPORATION HAS ACCESS TO SIGNIFICANT CAPACITY OF LONG-TERM AND SHORT-TERM

LIQUIDITY. INTERNALLY GENERATED FUNDS ARE EXPECTED TO COVER THE MAJORITY OF

FINANCIAL REQUIREMENTS, SUPPLEMENTED BY LONG-TERM AND SHORT-TERM DEBT. SOME

JOINT-VENTURE PARTNERS ARE DEPENDENT ON THE CREDIT MARKETS, AND THEIR FUNDING

ABILITY MAY IMPACT THE DEVELOPMENT PACE OF JOINT-VENTURE PROJECTS.

THE

CORPORATION CONDUCTS BUSINESS IN MANY FOREIGN CURRENCIES AND IS SUBJECT TO

EXCHANGE RATE RISK ON CASH FLOWS RELATED TO SALES, EXPENSES, FINANCING AND

INVESTMENT TRANSACTIONS. THE IMPACTS OF FLUCTUATIONS IN EXCHANGE RATES ON

EXXONMOBIL’S GEOGRAPHICALLY AND FUNCTIONALLY DIVERSE OPERATIONS ARE VARIED AND

OFTEN OFFSETTING IN AMOUNT. THE CORPORATION MAKES LIMITED USE OF CURRENCY

EXCHANGE CONTRACTS TO MITIGATE THE IMPACT OF CHANGES IN CURRENCY VALUES, AND

EXPOSURES RELATED TO THE CORPORATION’S LIMITED USE OF THE CURRENCY EXCHANGE

CONTRACTS ARE NOT MATERIAL.

INFLATION AND OTHER UNCERTAINTIES

THE

GENERAL RATE OF INFLATION IN MANY MAJOR COUNTRIES OF OPERATION HAS REMAINED

MODERATE OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS, AND THE ASSOCIATED IMPACT ON NON-ENERGY COSTS

HAS GENERALLY BEEN MITIGATED BY COST REDUCTIONS FROM EFFICIENCY AND

PRODUCTIVITY IMPROVEMENTS. BEGINNING SEVERAL YEARS AGO, AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF

INCREASED DEMAND FOR CERTAIN SERVICES AND MATERIALS RESULTED IN HIGHER

OPERATING AND CAPITAL COSTS. MORE RECENTLY, MULTIPLE MARKET CHANGES, INCLUDING

GENERAL COMMODITY PRICE DECREASES, LOWER OIL PRICES AND REDUCED UPSTREAM INDUSTRY

ACTIVITY, HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO LOWER PRICES FOR OILFIELD SERVICES AND MATERIALS.

THE CORPORATION WORKS TO MINIMIZE COSTS IN ALL COMMODITY PRICE ENVIRONMENTS THROUGH

ITS ECONOMIES OF SCALE IN GLOBAL PROCUREMENT AND ITS EFFICIENT PROJECT

MANAGEMENT PRACTICES.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

RECENTLY

ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

IN

MAY 2014, THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD ISSUED A NEW STANDARD,

REVENUE

FROM CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS

. THE STANDARD ESTABLISHES A SINGLE REVENUE

RECOGNITION MODEL FOR ALL CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS, ELIMINATES INDUSTRY

SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS, AND EXPANDS DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS. THE STANDARD IS

REQUIRED TO BE ADOPTED BEGINNING JANUARY 1, 2018. “SALES AND OTHER OPERATING

REVENUE” ON THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF INCOME INCLUDES SALES, EXCISE AND

VALUE-ADDED TAXES ON SALES TRANSACTIONS. WHEN THE CORPORATION ADOPTS THE STANDARD,

REVENUE WILL EXCLUDE SALES-BASED TAXES COLLECTED ON BEHALF OF THIRD PARTIES.

THIS CHANGE IN REPORTING WILL NOT IMPACT EARNINGS. THE CORPORATION EXPECTS TO

ADOPT THE STANDARD USING THE MODIFIED RETROSPECTIVE METHOD, UNDER WHICH PRIOR

YEARS’ RESULTS ARE NOT RESTATED, BUT SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION ON THE IMPACT OF

THE NEW STANDARD IS PROVIDED FOR 2018 RESULTS. THE CORPORATION CONTINUES TO

EVALUATE OTHER AREAS OF THE STANDARD, WHICH ARE NOT EXPECTED TO HAVE A MATERIAL

EFFECT ON THE CORPORATION’S FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

IN

FEBRUARY 2016, THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD ISSUED A NEW STANDARD,

LEASES.

THE STANDARD REQUIRES THAT ALL LEASES WITH AN INITIAL TERM GREATER THAN ONE

YEAR BE RECORDED ON THE BALANCE SHEET AS A LEASE ASSET AND A LEASE LIABILITY.

THE STANDARD IS REQUIRED TO BE ADOPTED BEGINNING JANUARY 1, 2019, WITH EARLY

ADOPTION PERMITTED. EXXONMOBIL IS EVALUATING THE STANDARD AND ITS EFFECT ON THE

CORPORATION’S FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND PLANS TO ADOPT IT IN 2019.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

THE

CORPORATION’S ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL REPORTING FAIRLY REFLECT ITS

STRAIGHTFORWARD BUSINESS MODEL INVOLVING THE EXTRACTING, REFINING AND MARKETING

OF HYDROCARBONS AND HYDROCARBON-BASED PRODUCTS. THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS IN CONFORMITY WITH U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES

(GAAP) REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS THAT AFFECT THE

REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS, LIABILITIES, REVENUES AND EXPENSES AND THE

DISCLOSURE OF CONTINGENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. THE CORPORATION’S ACCOUNTING

POLICIES ARE SUMMARIZED IN NOTE 1.

OIL AND NATURAL GAS RESERVES

THE

ESTIMATION OF PROVED RESERVES IS AN ONGOING PROCESS BASED ON RIGOROUS TECHNICAL

EVALUATIONS, COMMERCIAL AND MARKET ASSESSMENT, AND DETAILED ANALYSIS OF WELL

INFORMATION SUCH AS FLOW RATES AND RESERVOIR PRESSURE DECLINES, AMONG OTHER

FACTORS. THE ESTIMATION OF PROVED RESERVES IS CONTROLLED BY THE CORPORATION

THROUGH LONG-STANDING APPROVAL GUIDELINES. RESERVE CHANGES ARE MADE WITHIN A

WELL-ESTABLISHED, DISCIPLINED PROCESS DRIVEN BY SENIOR LEVEL GEOSCIENCE AND

ENGINEERING PROFESSIONALS, ASSISTED BY THE GLOBAL RESERVES GROUP WHICH HAS

SIGNIFICANT TECHNICAL EXPERIENCE, CULMINATING IN REVIEWS WITH AND APPROVAL BY

SENIOR MANAGEMENT. NOTABLY, THE CORPORATION DOES NOT USE SPECIFIC QUANTITATIVE

RESERVE TARGETS TO DETERMINE COMPENSATION. KEY FEATURES OF THE RESERVE

ESTIMATION PROCESS ARE COVERED IN DISCLOSURE OF RESERVES IN ITEM 2.

OIL

AND NATURAL GAS RESERVES INCLUDE BOTH PROVED AND UNPROVED RESERVES.

·

PROVED OIL AND NATURAL GAS

RESERVES ARE DETERMINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

(SEC) REQUIREMENTS. PROVED RESERVES ARE THOSE QUANTITIES OF OIL AND NATURAL GAS

WHICH, BY ANALYSIS OF GEOSCIENCE AND ENGINEERING DATA, CAN BE ESTIMATED WITH

REASONABLE CERTAINTY TO BE ECONOMICALLY PRODUCIBLE UNDER EXISTING ECONOMIC AND

OPERATING CONDITIONS AND GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS. PROVED RESERVES ARE DETERMINED

USING THE AVERAGE OF FIRST-OF-MONTH OIL AND NATURAL GAS PRICES DURING THE

REPORTING YEAR.

PROVED

RESERVES CAN BE FURTHER SUBDIVIDED INTO DEVELOPED AND UNDEVELOPED RESERVES.

PROVED DEVELOPED RESERVES INCLUDE AMOUNTS WHICH ARE EXPECTED TO BE RECOVERED

THROUGH EXISTING WELLS WITH EXISTING EQUIPMENT AND OPERATING METHODS. PROVED

UNDEVELOPED RESERVES INCLUDE AMOUNTS EXPECTED TO BE RECOVERED FROM NEW WELLS ON

UNDRILLED PROVED ACREAGE OR FROM EXISTING WELLS WHERE A RELATIVELY MAJOR

EXPENDITURE IS REQUIRED FOR COMPLETION. PROVED UNDEVELOPED RESERVES ARE

RECOGNIZED ONLY IF A DEVELOPMENT PLAN HAS BEEN ADOPTED INDICATING THAT THE

RESERVES ARE SCHEDULED TO BE DRILLED WITHIN FIVE YEARS, UNLESS SPECIFIC

CIRCUMSTANCES SUPPORT A LONGER PERIOD OF TIME.

THE

PERCENTAGE OF PROVED DEVELOPED RESERVES WAS 69 PERCENT OF TOTAL PROVED RESERVES

AT YEAR-END 2016 (INCLUDING BOTH CONSOLIDATED AND EQUITY COMPANY RESERVES), A

REDUCTION FROM 73 PERCENT IN 2015, AND HAS BEEN OVER 60 PERCENT FOR THE LAST

TEN YEARS. ALTHOUGH THE CORPORATION IS REASONABLY CERTAIN THAT PROVED RESERVES

WILL BE PRODUCED, THE TIMING AND AMOUNT RECOVERED CAN BE AFFECTED BY A NUMBER

OF FACTORS INCLUDING COMPLETION OF DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS, RESERVOIR PERFORMANCE,

REGULATORY APPROVALS AND SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN LONG-TERM OIL AND NATURAL GAS

PRICES.

·

UNPROVED RESERVES ARE QUANTITIES

OF OIL AND NATURAL GAS WITH LESS THAN REASONABLE CERTAINTY OF RECOVERABILITY

AND INCLUDE PROBABLE RESERVES. PROBABLE RESERVES ARE RESERVES THAT, TOGETHER

WITH PROVED RESERVES, ARE AS LIKELY AS NOT TO BE RECOVERED.

REVISIONS IN

PREVIOUSLY ESTIMATED VOLUMES OF PROVED RESERVES FOR EXISTING FIELDS CAN OCCUR DUE

TO THE EVALUATION OR RE-EVALUATION OF (1) ALREADY AVAILABLE GEOLOGIC,

RESERVOIR OR PRODUCTION DATA, (2) NEW GEOLOGIC, RESERVOIR OR PRODUCTION

DATA OR (3) CHANGES IN THE

57

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

AVERAGE OF

FIRST-OF-MONTH OIL AND NATURAL GAS PRICES AND / OR COSTS THAT ARE USED IN THE

ESTIMATION OF RESERVES. REVISIONS CAN ALSO RESULT FROM SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN

DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY OR PRODUCTION EQUIPMENT AND FACILITY CAPACITY.

AS A

RESULT OF VERY LOW PRICES DURING 2016

, UNDER THE SEC DEFINITION OF PROVED RESERVES, CERTAIN QUANTITIES

OF OIL AND NATURAL GAS THAT QUALIFIED AS PROVED RESERVES IN PRIOR YEARS DID NOT

QUALIFY AS PROVED RESERVES AT YEAR‐END 2016. AMOUNTS NO LONGER QUALIFYING

AS PROVED RESERVES INCLUDE THE ENTIRE 3.5 BILLION BARRELS OF BITUMEN AT KEARL,

IN CANADA. IN ADDITION, 0.8 BILLION BARRELS OF OIL EQUIVALENT ACROSS THE

REMAINDER OF NORTH AMERICA NO LONGER QUALIFY AS PROVED RESERVES MAINLY DUE TO

THE ACCELERATION OF THE PROJECTED END-OF-FIELD-LIFE. AMONG THE FACTORS THAT

WOULD RESULT IN THESE AMOUNTS BEING RECOGNIZED AGAIN AS PROVED RESERVES AT SOME

POINT IN THE FUTURE ARE A RECOVERY IN AVERAGE PRICE LEVELS, A FURTHER DECLINE

IN COSTS, AND / OR OPERATING EFFICIENCIES. UNDER THE TERMS OF CERTAIN

CONTRACTUAL ARRANGEMENTS OR GOVERNMENT ROYALTY REGIMES, LOWER PRICES CAN ALSO

INCREASE PROVED RESERVES ATTRIBUTABLE TO EXXONMOBIL. WE DO NOT EXPECT THE

DOWNWARD REVISION OF REPORTED PROVED RESERVES UNDER SEC DEFINITIONS TO AFFECT

THE OPERATION OF THE UNDERLYING PROJECTS OR TO ALTER OUR OUTLOOK FOR FUTURE

PRODUCTION VOLUMES.

SUPPLEMENTAL

INFORMATION REGARDING OIL AND NATURAL GAS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, CAPITALIZED

COSTS AND RESERVES IS PROVIDED FOLLOWING THE NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS.

UNIT-OF-PRODUCTION

DEPRECIATION

OIL

AND NATURAL GAS RESERVE QUANTITIES ARE USED AS THE BASIS TO CALCULATE

UNIT-OF-PRODUCTION DEPRECIATION RATES FOR MOST UPSTREAM ASSETS. DEPRECIATION IS

CALCULATED BY TAKING THE RATIO OF ASSET COST TO TOTAL PROVED RESERVES OR PROVED

DEVELOPED RESERVES APPLIED TO ACTUAL PRODUCTION. THE VOLUMES PRODUCED AND ASSET

COST ARE KNOWN, WHILE PROVED RESERVES ARE BASED ON ESTIMATES THAT ARE SUBJECT

TO SOME VARIABILITY.

IN THE

EVENT THAT THE UNIT-OF-PRODUCTION METHOD DOES NOT RESULT IN AN EQUITABLE

ALLOCATION OF COST OVER THE ECONOMIC LIFE OF AN UPSTREAM ASSET, AN ALTERNATIVE

METHOD IS USED. THE STRAIGHT-LINE METHOD IS USED IN LIMITED SITUATIONS WHERE

THE EXPECTED LIFE OF THE ASSET DOES NOT REASONABLY CORRELATE WITH THAT OF THE

UNDERLYING RESERVES. FOR EXAMPLE, CERTAIN ASSETS USED IN THE PRODUCTION OF OIL

AND NATURAL GAS HAVE A SHORTER LIFE THAN THE RESERVES, AND AS SUCH, THE

CORPORATION USES STRAIGHT-LINE DEPRECIATION TO ENSURE THE ASSET IS FULLY

DEPRECIATED BY THE END OF ITS USEFUL LIFE.

TO THE

EXTENT THAT PROVED RESERVES FOR A PROPERTY ARE ENTIRELY DE-BOOKED AND THAT

PROPERTY CONTINUES TO PRODUCE, ASSETS WILL BE DEPRECIATED USING A

UNIT-OF-PRODUCTION METHOD BASED ON RESERVES DETERMINED AT THE MOST RECENT SEC

PRICE WHICH RESULTS IN A QUANTITY OF PROVED RESERVES GREATER THAN ZERO,

APPROPRIATELY ADJUSTED FOR PRODUCTION AND TECHNICAL CHANGES. THE EFFECT OF THIS

APPROACH ON THE CORPORATION’S 2017 DEPRECIATION EXPENSE VERSUS 2016 IS

ANTICIPATED TO BE IMMATERIAL.

IMPAIRMENT

THE

CORPORATION TESTS ASSETS OR GROUPS OF ASSETS FOR RECOVERABILITY WHENEVER EVENTS

OR CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THAT THE CARRYING AMOUNTS MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE.

AMONG THE EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH COULD INDICATE THAT THE

CARRYING VALUE OF AN ASSET OR ASSET GROUP MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE ARE THE

FOLLOWING.

·

A SIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN THE

MARKET PRICE OF A LONG-LIVED ASSET;

·

A SIGNIFICANT ADVERSE CHANGE IN

THE EXTENT OR MANNER IN WHICH AN ASSET IS BEING USED OR IN ITS PHYSICAL

CONDITION INCLUDING A SIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN CURRENT AND PROJECTED RESERVE

VOLUMES;

·

A SIGNIFICANT ADVERSE CHANGE IN

LEGAL FACTORS OR IN THE BUSINESS CLIMATE THAT COULD AFFECT THE VALUE, INCLUDING

AN ADVERSE ACTION OR ASSESSMENT BY A REGULATOR;

·

AN ACCUMULATION OF PROJECT COSTS SIGNIFICANTLY

IN EXCESS OF THE AMOUNT ORIGINALLY EXPECTED;

·

A CURRENT-PERIOD OPERATING LOSS

COMBINED WITH A HISTORY AND FORECAST OF OPERATING OR CASH FLOW LOSSES; AND

·

A CURRENT EXPECTATION THAT, MORE

LIKELY THAN NOT, A LONG-LIVED ASSET WILL BE SOLD OR OTHERWISE DISPOSED OF

SIGNIFICANTLY BEFORE THE END OF ITS PREVIOUSLY ESTIMATED USEFUL LIFE.

THE

CORPORATION PERFORMS ASSET VALUATION ANALYSES ON AN ONGOING BASIS AS A PART OF

ITS ASSET MANAGEMENT PROGRAM. THESE ANALYSES AND OTHER PROFITABILITY REVIEWS

ASSIST THE CORPORATION IN ASSESSING WHETHER THE CARRYING AMOUNTS OF ANY OF ITS

ASSETS MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE.

IN

GENERAL, THE CORPORATION DOES NOT VIEW TEMPORARILY LOW PRICES OR MARGINS AS AN

INDICATION OF IMPAIRMENT. MANAGEMENT DOES NOT BELIEVE THAT LOWER PRICES ARE

SUSTAINABLE IF ENERGY IS TO BE DELIVERED WITH SUPPLY SECURITY TO MEET GLOBAL

DEMAND OVER THE LONG TERM. ALTHOUGH PRICES WILL OCCASIONALLY DROP

SIGNIFICANTLY, INDUSTRY PRICES OVER THE LONG TERM WILL CONTINUE TO BE DRIVEN BY

MARKET SUPPLY AND DEMAND. ON THE SUPPLY SIDE, INDUSTRY PRODUCTION FROM MATURE

FIELDS IS DECLINING, BUT THIS IS BEING OFFSET BY PRODUCTION FROM NEW

DISCOVERIES AND FIELD DEVELOPMENTS. OPEC PRODUCTION POLICIES ALSO HAVE AN

IMPACT ON WORLD OIL SUPPLIES. THE DEMAND SIDE IS LARGELY A FUNCTION OF GLOBAL

ECONOMIC GROWTH. BECAUSE THE LIFESPANS OF THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE

CORPORATION’S MAJOR ASSETS ARE MEASURED IN DECADES, THE VALUE OF THESE ASSETS

IS PREDOMINANTLY BASED ON LONG-TERM VIEWS OF FUTURE COMMODITY PRICES AND

58

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

PRODUCTION COSTS. DURING THE LIFESPAN OF THESE MAJOR

ASSETS, THE CORPORATION EXPECTS THAT OIL AND GAS PRICES WILL EXPERIENCE

SIGNIFICANT VOLATILITY, AND CONSEQUENTLY THESE ASSETS WILL EXPERIENCE PERIODS

OF HIGHER EARNINGS AND PERIODS OF LOWER EARNINGS, OR EVEN LOSSES. IN ASSESSING

WHETHER THE EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THE CARRYING VALUE OF

AN ASSET MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE, THE CORPORATION CONSIDERS RECENT PERIODS OF

OPERATING LOSSES IN THE CONTEXT OF ITS LONGER-TERM VIEW OF PRICES. WHILE

NEAR-TERM PRICES ARE SUBJECT TO WIDE FLUCTUATIONS, LONGER-TERM PRICE VIEWS ARE

MORE STABLE AND MEANINGFUL FOR PURPOSES OF ASSESSING FUTURE CASH FLOWS.

WHEN

THE INDUSTRY EXPERIENCES A PROLONGED AND DEEP REDUCTION IN COMMODITY PRICES,

THE MARKET SUPPLY AND DEMAND CONDITIONS MAY RESULT IN CHANGES TO THE

CORPORATION’S LONG-TERM PRICE OR MARGIN ASSUMPTIONS IT USES FOR ITS CAPITAL

INVESTMENT DECISIONS. TO THE EXTENT THOSE CHANGES RESULT IN A SIGNIFICANT

REDUCTION IN THE MID-POINT OF ITS LONG-TERM OIL, NATURAL GAS PRICE OR MARGIN

RANGES, THE CORPORATION MAY CONSIDER THAT SITUATION, IN CONJUNCTION WITH OTHER

EVENTS AND CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES SUCH AS A HISTORY OF OPERATING LOSSES, AN

INDICATOR OF POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT FOR CERTAIN ASSETS.

IN THE

UPSTREAM, THE STANDARDIZED MEASURE OF DISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS INCLUDED IN THE

SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION ON OIL AND GAS EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION ACTIVITIES

IS REQUIRED TO USE PRICES BASED ON THE AVERAGE OF FIRST-OF-MONTH PRICES. THESE

PRICES REPRESENT DISCRETE POINTS IN TIME AND COULD BE HIGHER OR LOWER THAN THE

CORPORATION’S LONG-TERM PRICE ASSUMPTIONS WHICH ARE USED FOR IMPAIRMENT

ASSESSMENTS. THE CORPORATION BELIEVES THE STANDARDIZED MEASURE DOES NOT PROVIDE

A RELIABLE ESTIMATE OF THE EXPECTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS TO BE OBTAINED FROM THE

DEVELOPMENT AND PRODUCTION OF ITS OIL AND GAS PROPERTIES OR OF THE VALUE OF ITS

OIL AND GAS RESERVES AND THEREFORE DOES NOT CONSIDER IT RELEVANT IN DETERMINING

WHETHER EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THE NEED FOR AN IMPAIRMENT

ASSESSMENT.

IF

EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THAT THE CARRYING VALUE MAY NOT BE

RECOVERABLE, THE CORPORATION ESTIMATES THE FUTURE UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS OF

THE AFFECTED PROPERTIES TO JUDGE THE RECOVERABILITY OF CARRYING AMOUNTS. IN

PERFORMING THIS ASSESSMENT, ASSETS ARE GROUPED AT THE LOWEST LEVEL FOR WHICH

THERE ARE IDENTIFIABLE CASH FLOWS THAT ARE LARGELY INDEPENDENT OF THE CASH

FLOWS OF OTHER GROUPS OF ASSETS. CASH FLOWS USED IN RECOVERABILITY ASSESSMENTS

ARE BASED ON THE CORPORATION’S ASSUMPTIONS WHICH ARE DEVELOPED IN THE ANNUAL PLANNING

AND BUDGETING PROCESS, AND ARE CONSISTENT WITH THE CRITERIA MANAGEMENT USES TO

EVALUATE INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES. THESE EVALUATIONS MAKE USE OF THE

CORPORATION’S ASSUMPTIONS OF FUTURE CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS COMMODITY PRICES,

REFINING AND CHEMICAL MARGINS, VOLUMES, COSTS, AND FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE

RATES. VOLUMES ARE BASED ON PROJECTED FIELD AND FACILITY PRODUCTION PROFILES,

THROUGHPUT, OR SALES. WHERE UNPROVED RESERVES EXIST, AN APPROPRIATELY

RISK-ADJUSTED AMOUNT OF THESE RESERVES MAY BE INCLUDED IN THE EVALUATION. CASH

FLOW ESTIMATES FOR IMPAIRMENT TESTING EXCLUDE THE EFFECTS OF DERIVATIVE

INSTRUMENTS.

AN

ASSET GROUP IS IMPAIRED IF ITS UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS ARE LESS THAN THE

ASSET’S CARRYING VALUE. IMPAIRMENTS ARE MEASURED BY THE AMOUNT BY WHICH THE

CARRYING VALUE EXCEEDS FAIR VALUE. FAIR VALUE IS BASED ON MARKET PRICES IF AN

ACTIVE MARKET EXISTS FOR THE ASSET GROUP, OR DISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS USING A

DISCOUNT RATE COMMENSURATE WITH THE RISK. SIGNIFICANT UNPROVED PROPERTIES ARE

ASSESSED FOR IMPAIRMENT INDIVIDUALLY, AND VALUATION ALLOWANCES AGAINST THE

CAPITALIZED COSTS ARE RECORDED BASED ON THE ESTIMATED ECONOMIC CHANCE OF

SUCCESS AND THE LENGTH OF TIME THAT THE CORPORATION EXPECTS TO HOLD THE

PROPERTIES. PROPERTIES THAT ARE NOT INDIVIDUALLY SIGNIFICANT ARE AGGREGATED BY

GROUPS AND AMORTIZED BASED ON DEVELOPMENT RISK AND AVERAGE HOLDING PERIOD.

CONTINUED

WEAKNESS IN THE UPSTREAM INDUSTRY ENVIRONMENT DURING 2016, CONTINUED WEAK

FINANCIAL RESULTS FOR SEVERAL ASSETS IN NORTH AMERICA, AND A REDUCTION IN THE

MID-POINT OF THE RANGES OF THE CORPORATION’S LONG-TERM OIL AND NATURAL GAS

PRICES DEVELOPED AS PART OF ITS ANNUAL PLANNING AND BUDGETING CYCLE LED THE

CORPORATION TO CONCLUDE THAT THE FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES SUPPORTED PERFORMING

AN IMPAIRMENT ASSESSMENT OF CERTAIN LONG-LIVED ASSETS, NOTABLY NORTH AMERICA

NATURAL GAS ASSETS AND CERTAIN OTHER ASSETS ACROSS THE REMAINDER OF ITS

UPSTREAM OPERATIONS. THE ASSESSMENT REFLECTED LONG-TERM CRUDE AND NATURAL GAS

PRICES WHICH ARE CONSISTENT WITH THE MID-POINT OF THE RANGES THAT MANAGEMENT

USES TO EVALUATE INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES AND WHICH ARE IN THE RANGE OF

LONG-TERM PRICE FORECASTS PUBLISHED BY THIRD-PARTY INDUSTRY EXPERTS AND

GOVERNMENT AGENCIES. THIS ASSESSMENT INDICATED THAT THE VAST MAJORITY OF ASSET

GROUPS HAVE FUTURE UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOW ESTIMATES EXCEEDING CARRYING VALUES.

HOWEVER, THE CARRYING VALUES FOR CERTAIN ASSET GROUPS IN THE UNITED STATES

EXCEEDED THE ESTIMATED CASH FLOWS. AS A RESULT, THE CORPORATION’S FOURTH

QUARTER 2016 RESULTS INCLUDE AN AFTER-TAX CHARGE OF $2 BILLION TO REDUCE THE

CARRYING VALUE OF THOSE ASSETS TO FAIR VALUE. THE ASSET GROUPS SUBJECT TO THIS

IMPAIRMENT CHARGE ARE PRIMARILY DRY GAS OPERATIONS IN THE ROCKY MOUNTAINS

REGION OF THE UNITED STATES WITH LARGE UNDEVELOPED ACREAGE POSITIONS.

THE

ASSESSMENT OF FAIR VALUES REQUIRED THE USE OF LEVEL 3 INPUTS. THE PRINCIPAL

PARAMETERS USED TO ESTABLISH FAIR VALUES INCLUDED ESTIMATES OF BOTH PROVED AND

UNPROVED RESERVES, FUTURE COMMODITY PRICES WHICH WERE CONSISTENT WITH THE

AVERAGE OF THIRD-PARTY INDUSTRY EXPERTS AND GOVERNMENT AGENCIES, DRILLING AND

DEVELOPMENT COSTS, DISCOUNT RATES RANGING FROM 5.5 PERCENT TO 8 PERCENT

DEPENDING ON THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE ASSET GROUP, AND COMPARABLE MARKET

TRANSACTIONS. DUE TO THE INHERENT DIFFICULTY IN PREDICTING FUTURE COMMODITY

PRICES, AND THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN INDUSTRY PRICES AND COSTS, IT IS NOT

PRACTICABLE TO REASONABLY ESTIMATE THE EXISTENCE OR RANGE OF ANY POTENTIAL

FUTURE IMPAIRMENT CHARGES RELATED TO THE CORPORATION’S LONG-LIVED ASSETS.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

INVENTORIES

CRUDE

OIL, PRODUCTS AND MERCHANDISE INVENTORIES ARE CARRIED AT THE LOWER OF CURRENT

MARKET VALUE OR COST (GENERALLY DETERMINED UNDER THE LAST-IN, FIRST-OUT METHOD

– LIFO).

ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS

THE

CORPORATION INCURS RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS FOR CERTAIN ASSETS. THE FAIR VALUES OF

THESE OBLIGATIONS ARE RECORDED AS LIABILITIES ON A DISCOUNTED BASIS, WHICH IS

TYPICALLY AT THE TIME THE ASSETS ARE INSTALLED. IN THE ESTIMATION OF FAIR

VALUE, THE CORPORATION USES ASSUMPTIONS AND JUDGMENTS REGARDING SUCH FACTORS AS

THE EXISTENCE OF A LEGAL OBLIGATION FOR AN ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATION;

TECHNICAL ASSESSMENTS OF THE ASSETS; ESTIMATED AMOUNTS AND TIMING OF

SETTLEMENTS; DISCOUNT RATES; AND INFLATION RATES. ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS

ARE DISCLOSED IN NOTE 9 TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

SUSPENDED EXPLORATORY WELL COSTS

THE

CORPORATION CONTINUES CAPITALIZATION OF EXPLORATORY WELL COSTS WHEN THE WELL

HAS FOUND A SUFFICIENT QUANTITY OF RESERVES TO JUSTIFY ITS COMPLETION AS A

PRODUCING WELL AND THE CORPORATION IS MAKING SUFFICIENT PROGRESS ASSESSING THE

RESERVES AND THE ECONOMIC AND OPERATING VIABILITY OF THE PROJECT. EXPLORATORY

WELL COSTS NOT MEETING THESE CRITERIA ARE CHARGED TO EXPENSE. THE FACTS AND

CIRCUMSTANCES THAT SUPPORT CONTINUED CAPITALIZATION OF SUSPENDED WELLS AT YEAR-END

ARE DISCLOSED IN NOTE 10 TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

CONSOLIDATIONS

THE

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDE THE ACCOUNTS OF THOSE SUBSIDIARIES

THAT THE CORPORATION CONTROLS. THEY ALSO INCLUDE THE CORPORATION’S SHARE OF THE

UNDIVIDED INTEREST IN CERTAIN UPSTREAM ASSETS, LIABILITIES, REVENUES AND

EXPENSES. AMOUNTS REPRESENTING THE CORPORATION’S INTEREST IN THE UNDERLYING NET

ASSETS OF OTHER SIGNIFICANT ENTITIES THAT IT DOES NOT CONTROL, BUT OVER WHICH

IT EXERCISES SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE, ARE ACCOUNTED FOR USING THE EQUITY METHOD

OF ACCOUNTING.

INVESTMENTS

IN COMPANIES THAT ARE PARTIALLY OWNED BY THE CORPORATION ARE INTEGRAL TO THE

CORPORATION’S OPERATIONS. IN SOME CASES THEY SERVE TO BALANCE WORLDWIDE RISKS,

AND IN OTHERS THEY PROVIDE THE ONLY AVAILABLE MEANS OF ENTRY INTO A PARTICULAR

MARKET OR AREA OF INTEREST. THE OTHER PARTIES, WHO ALSO HAVE AN EQUITY INTEREST

IN THESE COMPANIES, ARE EITHER INDEPENDENT THIRD PARTIES OR HOST GOVERNMENTS

THAT SHARE IN THE BUSINESS RESULTS ACCORDING TO THEIR OWNERSHIP. THE

CORPORATION DOES NOT INVEST IN THESE COMPANIES IN ORDER TO REMOVE LIABILITIES

FROM ITS BALANCE SHEET. IN FACT, THE CORPORATION HAS LONG BEEN ON RECORD

SUPPORTING AN ALTERNATIVE ACCOUNTING METHOD THAT WOULD REQUIRE EACH INVESTOR TO

CONSOLIDATE ITS SHARE OF ALL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES IN THESE PARTIALLY-OWNED

COMPANIES RATHER THAN ONLY ITS INTEREST IN NET EQUITY. THIS METHOD OF

ACCOUNTING FOR INVESTMENTS IN PARTIALLY-OWNED COMPANIES IS NOT PERMITTED BY U.S.

GAAP EXCEPT WHERE THE INVESTMENTS ARE IN THE DIRECT OWNERSHIP OF A SHARE OF

UPSTREAM ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. HOWEVER, FOR PURPOSES OF CALCULATING RETURN ON

AVERAGE CAPITAL EMPLOYED, WHICH IS NOT COVERED BY U.S. GAAP STANDARDS, THE

CORPORATION INCLUDES ITS SHARE OF DEBT OF THESE PARTIALLY-OWNED COMPANIES IN

THE DETERMINATION OF AVERAGE CAPITAL EMPLOYED.

PENSION BENEFITS

THE

CORPORATION AND ITS AFFILIATES SPONSOR NEARLY 100 DEFINED BENEFIT (PENSION)

PLANS IN OVER 40 COUNTRIES. THE PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS FOOTNOTE

(NOTE 17) PROVIDES DETAILS ON PENSION OBLIGATIONS, FUND ASSETS AND PENSION

EXPENSE.

SOME

OF THESE PLANS (PRIMARILY NON-U.S.) PROVIDE PENSION BENEFITS THAT ARE PAID

DIRECTLY BY THEIR SPONSORING AFFILIATES OUT OF CORPORATE CASH FLOW RATHER THAN

A SEPARATE PENSION FUND BECAUSE APPLICABLE TAX RULES AND REGULATORY PRACTICES

DO NOT ENCOURAGE ADVANCE FUNDING. BOOK RESERVES ARE ESTABLISHED FOR THESE

PLANS. THE PORTION OF THE PENSION COST ATTRIBUTABLE TO EMPLOYEE SERVICE IS

EXPENSED AS SERVICES ARE RENDERED. THE PORTION ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE INCREASE IN

PENSION OBLIGATIONS DUE TO THE PASSAGE OF TIME IS EXPENSED OVER THE TERM OF THE

OBLIGATIONS, WHICH ENDS WHEN ALL BENEFITS ARE PAID. THE PRIMARY DIFFERENCE IN

PENSION EXPENSE FOR UNFUNDED VERSUS FUNDED PLANS IS THAT PENSION EXPENSE FOR

FUNDED PLANS ALSO INCLUDES A CREDIT FOR THE EXPECTED LONG-TERM RETURN ON FUND

ASSETS.

FOR

FUNDED PLANS, INCLUDING THOSE IN THE U.S., PENSION OBLIGATIONS ARE FINANCED IN

ADVANCE THROUGH SEGREGATED ASSETS OR INSURANCE ARRANGEMENTS. THESE PLANS ARE

MANAGED IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE REQUIREMENTS OF GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORITIES AND

MEET OR EXCEED REQUIRED FUNDING LEVELS AS MEASURED BY RELEVANT ACTUARIAL AND

GOVERNMENT STANDARDS AT THE MANDATED MEASUREMENT DATES. IN DETERMINING

LIABILITIES AND REQUIRED CONTRIBUTIONS, THESE STANDARDS OFTEN REQUIRE

APPROACHES AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT DIFFER FROM THOSE USED FOR ACCOUNTING PURPOSES.

60

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

THE CORPORATION WILL CONTINUE TO MAKE

CONTRIBUTIONS TO THESE FUNDED PLANS AS NECESSARY. ALL DEFINED-BENEFIT PENSION

OBLIGATIONS, REGARDLESS OF THE FUNDING STATUS OF THE UNDERLYING PLANS, ARE

FULLY SUPPORTED BY THE FINANCIAL STRENGTH OF THE CORPORATION OR THE RESPECTIVE

SPONSORING AFFILIATE.

PENSION

ACCOUNTING REQUIRES EXPLICIT ASSUMPTIONS REGARDING, AMONG OTHERS, THE LONG-TERM

EXPECTED EARNINGS RATE ON FUND ASSETS, THE DISCOUNT RATE FOR THE BENEFIT

OBLIGATIONS AND THE LONG-TERM RATE FOR FUTURE SALARY INCREASES. PENSION

ASSUMPTIONS ARE REVIEWED ANNUALLY BY OUTSIDE ACTUARIES AND SENIOR MANAGEMENT.

THESE ASSUMPTIONS ARE ADJUSTED AS APPROPRIATE TO REFLECT CHANGES IN MARKET

RATES AND OUTLOOK. THE LONG-TERM EXPECTED EARNINGS RATE ON U.S. PENSION PLAN

ASSETS IN 2016 WAS 6.50 PERCENT. THE 10‐YEAR AND 20‐YEAR ACTUAL

RETURNS ON U.S. PENSION PLAN ASSETS WERE 5 PERCENT AND 8 PERCENT, RESPECTIVELY.

THE CORPORATION ESTABLISHES THE LONG‐TERM EXPECTED RATE OF RETURN BY

DEVELOPING A FORWARD-LOOKING, LONG-TERM RETURN ASSUMPTION FOR EACH PENSION FUND

ASSET CLASS, TAKING INTO ACCOUNT FACTORS SUCH AS THE EXPECTED REAL RETURN FOR

THE SPECIFIC ASSET CLASS AND INFLATION. A SINGLE, LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN IS

THEN CALCULATED AS THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE OF THE TARGET ASSET ALLOCATION

PERCENTAGES AND THE LONG-TERM RETURN ASSUMPTION FOR EACH ASSET CLASS. A

WORLDWIDE REDUCTION OF 0.5 PERCENT IN THE LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN ON ASSETS

WOULD INCREASE ANNUAL PENSION EXPENSE BY APPROXIMATELY $160 MILLION BEFORE TAX.

DIFFERENCES

BETWEEN ACTUAL RETURNS ON FUND ASSETS AND THE LONG-TERM EXPECTED RETURN ARE NOT

RECOGNIZED IN PENSION EXPENSE IN THE YEAR THAT THE DIFFERENCE OCCURS. SUCH

DIFFERENCES ARE DEFERRED, ALONG WITH OTHER ACTUARIAL GAINS AND LOSSES, AND ARE

AMORTIZED INTO PENSION EXPENSE OVER THE EXPECTED REMAINING SERVICE LIFE OF

EMPLOYEES.

LITIGATION CONTINGENCIES

A

VARIETY OF CLAIMS HAVE BEEN MADE AGAINST THE CORPORATION AND CERTAIN OF ITS

CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES IN A NUMBER OF PENDING LAWSUITS. MANAGEMENT HAS

REGULAR LITIGATION REVIEWS, INCLUDING UPDATES FROM CORPORATE AND OUTSIDE

COUNSEL, TO ASSESS THE NEED FOR ACCOUNTING RECOGNITION OR DISCLOSURE OF THESE

CONTINGENCIES. THE STATUS OF SIGNIFICANT CLAIMS IS SUMMARIZED IN NOTE 16.

THE

CORPORATION ACCRUES AN UNDISCOUNTED LIABILITY FOR THOSE CONTINGENCIES WHERE THE

INCURRENCE OF A LOSS IS PROBABLE, AND THE AMOUNT CAN BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED.

THESE AMOUNTS ARE NOT REDUCED BY AMOUNTS THAT MAY BE RECOVERED UNDER INSURANCE

OR CLAIMS AGAINST THIRD PARTIES, BUT UNDISCOUNTED RECEIVABLES FROM INSURERS OR

OTHER THIRD PARTIES MAY BE ACCRUED SEPARATELY. THE CORPORATION REVISES SUCH

ACCRUALS IN LIGHT OF NEW INFORMATION. FOR CONTINGENCIES WHERE AN UNFAVORABLE

OUTCOME IS REASONABLY POSSIBLE AND WHICH ARE SIGNIFICANT, THE CORPORATION

DISCLOSES THE NATURE OF THE CONTINGENCY AND, WHERE FEASIBLE, AN ESTIMATE OF THE

POSSIBLE LOSS. FOR PURPOSES OF OUR LITIGATION CONTINGENCY DISCLOSURES,

“SIGNIFICANT” INCLUDES MATERIAL MATTERS AS WELL AS OTHER ITEMS WHICH MANAGEMENT

BELIEVES SHOULD BE DISCLOSED.

MANAGEMENT

JUDGMENT IS REQUIRED RELATED TO CONTINGENT LIABILITIES AND THE OUTCOME OF

LITIGATION BECAUSE BOTH ARE DIFFICULT TO PREDICT. HOWEVER, THE CORPORATION HAS

BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN DEFENDING LITIGATION IN THE PAST. PAYMENTS HAVE NOT HAD A

MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OPERATIONS OR FINANCIAL CONDITION. IN THE

CORPORATION’S EXPERIENCE, LARGE CLAIMS OFTEN DO NOT RESULT IN LARGE AWARDS.

LARGE AWARDS ARE OFTEN REVERSED OR SUBSTANTIALLY REDUCED AS A RESULT OF APPEAL

OR SETTLEMENT.

TAX CONTINGENCIES

THE

CORPORATION IS SUBJECT TO INCOME TAXATION IN MANY JURISDICTIONS AROUND THE

WORLD. SIGNIFICANT MANAGEMENT JUDGMENT IS REQUIRED IN THE ACCOUNTING FOR INCOME

TAX CONTINGENCIES AND TAX DISPUTES BECAUSE THE OUTCOMES ARE OFTEN DIFFICULT TO

PREDICT.

THE BENEFITS OF UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS

THAT THE CORPORATION HAS TAKEN OR EXPECTS TO TAKE IN ITS INCOME TAX RETURNS ARE

RECOGNIZED IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IF MANAGEMENT CONCLUDES THAT IT IS MORE

LIKELY THAN NOT THAT THE POSITION WILL BE SUSTAINED WITH THE TAX AUTHORITIES.

FOR A POSITION THAT IS LIKELY TO BE SUSTAINED, THE BENEFIT RECOGNIZED IN THE

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IS MEASURED AT THE LARGEST AMOUNT THAT IS GREATER THAN 50

PERCENT LIKELY OF BEING REALIZED. A RESERVE IS ESTABLISHED FOR THE DIFFERENCE

BETWEEN A POSITION TAKEN OR EXPECTED TO BE TAKEN IN AN INCOME TAX RETURN AND

THE AMOUNT RECOGNIZED IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. THE CORPORATION’S

UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS AND A DESCRIPTION OF OPEN TAX YEARS ARE SUMMARIZED IN

NOTE 19.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

FOREIGN

CURRENCY TRANSLATION

THE

METHOD OF TRANSLATING THE FOREIGN CURRENCY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF THE

CORPORATION’S INTERNATIONAL SUBSIDIARIES INTO U.S. DOLLARS IS PRESCRIBED BY

GAAP. UNDER THESE PRINCIPLES, IT IS NECESSARY TO SELECT THE FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY

OF THESE SUBSIDIARIES. THE FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY IS THE CURRENCY OF THE PRIMARY

ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH THE SUBSIDIARY OPERATES. MANAGEMENT SELECTS THE

FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY AFTER EVALUATING THIS ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT.

FACTORS

CONSIDERED BY MANAGEMENT WHEN DETERMINING THE FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY FOR A

SUBSIDIARY INCLUDE THE CURRENCY USED FOR CASH FLOWS RELATED TO INDIVIDUAL

ASSETS AND LIABILITIES; THE RESPONSIVENESS OF SALES PRICES TO CHANGES IN

EXCHANGE RATES; THE HISTORY OF INFLATION IN THE COUNTRY; WHETHER SALES ARE INTO

LOCAL MARKETS OR EXPORTED; THE CURRENCY USED TO ACQUIRE RAW MATERIALS, LABOR,

SERVICES AND SUPPLIES; SOURCES OF FINANCING; AND SIGNIFICANCE OF INTERCOMPANY

TRANSACTIONS.

CASH FLOWS FOR EACH OF THE THREE YEARS IN THE PERIOD ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2016

IN CONFORMITY WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED

STATES OF AMERICA. ALSO IN OUR OPINION, THE CORPORATION MAINTAINED, IN ALL

MATERIAL RESPECTS, EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2016, BASED ON CRITERIA ESTABLISHED IN

INTERNAL CONTROL –

INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK (2013)

ISSUED BY THE COMMITTEE OF SPONSORING

ORGANIZATIONS OF THE TREADWAY COMMISSION (COSO). THE CORPORATION’S MANAGEMENT

IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, FOR MAINTAINING EFFECTIVE

INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AND FOR ITS ASSESSMENT OF THE

EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, INCLUDED IN THE

ACCOMPANYING MANAGEMENT’S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING.

OUR RESPONSIBILITY IS TO EXPRESS OPINIONS ON THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND ON

THE CORPORATION’S INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING BASED ON OUR

INTEGRATED AUDITS. WE CONDUCTED OUR AUDITS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE STANDARDS OF

THE PUBLIC COMPANY ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BOARD (UNITED STATES). THOSE STANDARDS

REQUIRE THAT WE PLAN AND PERFORM THE AUDITS TO OBTAIN REASONABLE ASSURANCE

ABOUT WHETHER THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE FREE OF MATERIAL MISSTATEMENT AND

WHETHER EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING WAS MAINTAINED IN

ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS. OUR AUDITS OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED

EXAMINING, ON A TEST BASIS, EVIDENCE SUPPORTING THE AMOUNTS AND DISCLOSURES IN

THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, ASSESSING THE ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES USED AND

SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES MADE BY MANAGEMENT, AND EVALUATING THE OVERALL FINANCIAL

STATEMENT PRESENTATION. OUR AUDIT OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

INCLUDED OBTAINING AN UNDERSTANDING OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL

REPORTING, ASSESSING THE RISK THAT A MATERIAL WEAKNESS EXISTS, AND TESTING AND

EVALUATING THE DESIGN AND OPERATING EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL CONTROL BASED ON

THE ASSESSED RISK. OUR AUDITS ALSO INCLUDED PERFORMING SUCH OTHER PROCEDURES AS

WE CONSIDERED NECESSARY IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR AUDITS PROVIDE

A REASONABLE BASIS FOR OUR OPINIONS.

A COMPANY’S INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING IS A

PROCESS DESIGNED TO PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING THE RELIABILITY OF

FINANCIAL REPORTING AND THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR EXTERNAL

PURPOSES IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES. A

COMPANY’S INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING INCLUDES THOSE POLICIES AND

PROCEDURES THAT (I) PERTAIN TO THE MAINTENANCE OF RECORDS THAT, IN

REASONABLE DETAIL, ACCURATELY AND FAIRLY REFLECT THE TRANSACTIONS AND

DISPOSITIONS OF THE ASSETS OF THE COMPANY; (II) PROVIDE REASONABLE

ASSURANCE THAT TRANSACTIONS ARE RECORDED AS NECESSARY TO PERMIT PREPARATION OF

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING

PRINCIPLES, AND THAT RECEIPTS AND EXPENDITURES OF THE COMPANY ARE BEING MADE

ONLY IN ACCORDANCE WITH AUTHORIZATIONS OF MANAGEMENT AND DIRECTORS OF THE

COMPANY; AND (III) PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING PREVENTION OR

TIMELY DETECTION OF UNAUTHORIZED ACQUISITION, USE, OR DISPOSITION OF THE

COMPANY’S ASSETS THAT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

BECAUSE OF ITS INHERENT LIMITATIONS, INTERNAL CONTROL OVER

FINANCIAL REPORTING MAY NOT PREVENT OR DETECT MISSTATEMENTS. ALSO, PROJECTIONS

OF ANY EVALUATION OF EFFECTIVENESS TO FUTURE PERIODS ARE SUBJECT TO THE RISK

THAT CONTROLS MAY BECOME INADEQUATE BECAUSE OF CHANGES IN CONDITIONS, OR THAT

THE DEGREE OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE POLICIES OR PROCEDURES MAY DETERIORATE.

THE

INFORMATION IN THE NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IS AN INTEGRAL

PART OF THESE STATEMENTS.

69

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS AND THE SUPPORTING AND SUPPLEMENTAL MATERIAL ARE THE RESPONSIBILITY

OF THE MANAGEMENT OF EXXON MOBIL CORPORATION.

THE

CORPORATION’S PRINCIPAL BUSINESS IS ENERGY, INVOLVING THE WORLDWIDE

EXPLORATION, PRODUCTION, TRANSPORTATION AND SALE OF CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS

(UPSTREAM) AND THE MANUFACTURE, TRANSPORTATION AND SALE OF PETROLEUM PRODUCTS

(DOWNSTREAM). THE CORPORATION IS ALSO A MAJOR WORLDWIDE MANUFACTURER AND

MARKETER OF PETROCHEMICALS (CHEMICAL).

THE

PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN CONFORMITY WITH U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED

ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES (GAAP) REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO MAKE ESTIMATES THAT AFFECT

THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS, LIABILITIES, REVENUES AND EXPENSES AND THE

DISCLOSURE OF CONTINGENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. ACTUAL RESULTS COULD DIFFER

FROM THESE ESTIMATES. PRIOR YEARS’ DATA HAS BEEN RECLASSIFIED IN CERTAIN CASES

TO CONFORM TO THE 2016 PRESENTATION BASIS.

1.

SUMMARY OF ACCOUNTING POLICIES

PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION

THE

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDE THE ACCOUNTS OF SUBSIDIARIES THE

CORPORATION CONTROLS. THEY ALSO INCLUDE THE CORPORATION’S SHARE OF THE

UNDIVIDED INTEREST IN CERTAIN UPSTREAM ASSETS, LIABILITIES, REVENUES AND

EXPENSES.

AMOUNTS

REPRESENTING THE CORPORATION’S INTEREST IN ENTITIES THAT IT DOES NOT CONTROL,

BUT OVER WHICH IT EXERCISES SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE, ARE INCLUDED IN

“INVESTMENTS, ADVANCES AND LONG-TERM RECEIVABLES”. THE CORPORATION’S SHARE OF

THE NET INCOME OF THESE COMPANIES IS INCLUDED IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF

INCOME CAPTION “INCOME FROM EQUITY AFFILIATES”.

MAJORITY

OWNERSHIP IS NORMALLY THE INDICATOR OF CONTROL THAT IS THE BASIS ON WHICH

SUBSIDIARIES ARE CONSOLIDATED. HOWEVER, CERTAIN FACTORS MAY INDICATE THAT A

MAJORITY-OWNED INVESTMENT IS NOT CONTROLLED AND THEREFORE SHOULD BE ACCOUNTED

FOR USING THE EQUITY METHOD OF ACCOUNTING. THESE FACTORS OCCUR WHERE THE

MINORITY SHAREHOLDERS ARE GRANTED BY LAW OR BY CONTRACT SUBSTANTIVE

PARTICIPATING RIGHTS. THESE INCLUDE THE RIGHT TO APPROVE OPERATING POLICIES,

EXPENSE BUDGETS, FINANCING AND INVESTMENT PLANS, AND MANAGEMENT COMPENSATION

AND SUCCESSION PLANS.

EVIDENCE OF

LOSS IN VALUE THAT MIGHT INDICATE IMPAIRMENT OF INVESTMENTS IN COMPANIES

ACCOUNTED FOR ON THE EQUITY METHOD IS ASSESSED TO DETERMINE IF SUCH EVIDENCE

REPRESENTS A LOSS IN VALUE OF THE CORPORATION’S INVESTMENT THAT IS OTHER THAN

TEMPORARY. EXAMPLES OF KEY INDICATORS INCLUDE A HISTORY OF OPERATING LOSSES,

NEGATIVE EARNINGS AND CASH FLOW OUTLOOK, SIGNIFICANT DOWNWARD REVISIONS TO OIL

AND GAS RESERVES, AND THE FINANCIAL CONDITION AND PROSPECTS FOR THE INVESTEE’S

BUSINESS SEGMENT OR GEOGRAPHIC REGION. IF EVIDENCE OF AN OTHER THAN TEMPORARY

LOSS IN FAIR VALUE BELOW CARRYING AMOUNT IS DETERMINED, AN IMPAIRMENT IS

RECOGNIZED. IN THE ABSENCE OF MARKET PRICES FOR THE INVESTMENT, DISCOUNTED CASH

FLOWS ARE USED TO ASSESS FAIR VALUE.

THE

CORPORATION’S SHARE OF THE CUMULATIVE FOREIGN EXCHANGE TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENT

FOR EQUITY METHOD INVESTMENTS IS REPORTED IN ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE

INCOME.

REVENUE RECOGNITION

THE

CORPORATION GENERALLY SELLS CRUDE OIL, NATURAL GAS AND PETROLEUM AND CHEMICAL

PRODUCTS UNDER SHORT-TERM AGREEMENTS AT PREVAILING MARKET PRICES. IN SOME CASES

(E.G., NATURAL GAS), PRODUCTS MAY BE SOLD UNDER LONG-TERM AGREEMENTS, WITH

PERIODIC PRICE ADJUSTMENTS. REVENUES ARE RECOGNIZED WHEN THE PRODUCTS ARE

DELIVERED, WHICH OCCURS WHEN THE CUSTOMER HAS TAKEN TITLE AND HAS ASSUMED THE

RISKS AND REWARDS OF OWNERSHIP, PRICES ARE FIXED OR DETERMINABLE AND

COLLECTIBILITY IS REASONABLY ASSURED.

REVENUES

FROM THE PRODUCTION OF NATURAL GAS PROPERTIES IN WHICH THE CORPORATION HAS AN

INTEREST WITH OTHER PRODUCERS ARE RECOGNIZED ON THE BASIS OF THE CORPORATION’S

NET WORKING INTEREST. DIFFERENCES BETWEEN ACTUAL PRODUCTION AND NET WORKING

INTEREST VOLUMES ARE NOT SIGNIFICANT.

PURCHASES

AND SALES OF INVENTORY WITH THE SAME COUNTERPARTY THAT ARE ENTERED INTO IN

CONTEMPLATION OF ONE ANOTHER ARE COMBINED AND RECORDED AS EXCHANGES MEASURED AT

THE BOOK VALUE OF THE ITEM SOLD.

SALES-BASED

TAXES

THE

CORPORATION REPORTS SALES, EXCISE AND VALUE-ADDED TAXES ON SALES TRANSACTIONS

ON A GROSS BASIS IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF INCOME (INCLUDED IN BOTH

REVENUES AND COSTS).

DERIVATIVE

INSTRUMENTS

THE CORPORATION

MAKES LIMITED USE OF DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS. THE CORPORATION DOES NOT ENGAGE IN

SPECULATIVE DERIVATIVE ACTIVITIES OR DERIVATIVE TRADING ACTIVITIES, NOR DOES IT

USE DERIVATIVES WITH LEVERAGED FEATURES. WHEN THE CORPORATION DOES ENTER INTO

DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS, IT IS TO OFFSET EXPOSURES ASSOCIATED WITH INTEREST

RATES, FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES AND HYDROCARBON PRICES THAT ARISE FROM

EXISTING ASSETS, LIABILITIES AND FORECASTED TRANSACTIONS.

70

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

THE GAINS AND LOSSES RESULTING FROM CHANGES IN THE FAIR

VALUE OF DERIVATIVES ARE RECORDED IN INCOME. IN SOME CASES, THE CORPORATION

DESIGNATES DERIVATIVES AS FAIR VALUE HEDGES, IN WHICH CASE THE GAINS AND LOSSES

ARE OFFSET IN INCOME BY THE GAINS AND LOSSES ARISING FROM CHANGES IN THE FAIR

VALUE OF THE UNDERLYING HEDGED ITEM.

FAIR

VALUE

FAIR VALUE

IS THE PRICE THAT WOULD BE RECEIVED TO SELL AN ASSET OR PAID TO TRANSFER A

LIABILITY IN AN ORDERLY TRANSACTION BETWEEN MARKET PARTICIPANTS. HIERARCHY

LEVELS 1, 2 AND 3 ARE TERMS FOR THE PRIORITY OF INPUTS TO VALUATION TECHNIQUES

USED TO MEASURE FAIR VALUE. HIERARCHY LEVEL 1 INPUTS ARE QUOTED PRICES IN

ACTIVE MARKETS FOR IDENTICAL ASSETS OR LIABILITIES. HIERARCHY LEVEL 2

INPUTS ARE INPUTS OTHER THAN QUOTED PRICES INCLUDED WITHIN LEVEL 1 THAT

ARE DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY OBSERVABLE FOR THE ASSET OR LIABILITY. HIERARCHY

LEVEL 3 INPUTS ARE INPUTS THAT ARE NOT OBSERVABLE IN THE MARKET.

INVENTORIES

CRUDE OIL,

PRODUCTS AND MERCHANDISE INVENTORIES ARE CARRIED AT THE LOWER OF CURRENT MARKET

VALUE OR COST (GENERALLY DETERMINED UNDER THE LAST-IN, FIRST-OUT METHOD –

LIFO). INVENTORY COSTS INCLUDE EXPENDITURES AND OTHER CHARGES (INCLUDING

DEPRECIATION) DIRECTLY AND INDIRECTLY INCURRED IN BRINGING THE INVENTORY TO ITS

EXISTING CONDITION AND LOCATION. SELLING EXPENSES AND GENERAL AND

ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES ARE REPORTED AS PERIOD COSTS AND EXCLUDED FROM

INVENTORY COST. INVENTORIES OF MATERIALS AND SUPPLIES ARE VALUED AT COST OR

LESS.

PROPERTY,

PLANT AND EQUIPMENT

COST

BASIS.

THE CORPORATION USES THE

“SUCCESSFUL EFFORTS” METHOD TO ACCOUNT FOR ITS EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION

ACTIVITIES. UNDER THIS METHOD, COSTS ARE ACCUMULATED ON A FIELD-BY-FIELD BASIS.

COSTS INCURRED TO PURCHASE, LEASE, OR OTHERWISE ACQUIRE A PROPERTY (WHETHER

UNPROVED OR PROVED) ARE CAPITALIZED WHEN INCURRED. EXPLORATORY WELL COSTS ARE

CARRIED AS AN ASSET WHEN THE WELL HAS FOUND A SUFFICIENT QUANTITY OF RESERVES

TO JUSTIFY ITS COMPLETION AS A PRODUCING WELL AND WHERE THE CORPORATION IS

MAKING SUFFICIENT PROGRESS ASSESSING THE RESERVES AND THE ECONOMIC AND

OPERATING VIABILITY OF THE PROJECT. EXPLORATORY WELL COSTS NOT MEETING THESE

CRITERIA ARE CHARGED TO EXPENSE. OTHER EXPLORATORY EXPENDITURES, INCLUDING

GEOPHYSICAL COSTS AND ANNUAL LEASE RENTALS, ARE EXPENSED AS INCURRED.

DEVELOPMENT COSTS, INCLUDING COSTS OF PRODUCTIVE WELLS AND DEVELOPMENT DRY

HOLES, ARE CAPITALIZED.

DEPRECIATION,

DEPLETION AND AMORTIZATION.

DEPRECIATION,

DEPLETION AND AMORTIZATION ARE PRIMARILY DETERMINED UNDER EITHER THE

UNIT-OF-PRODUCTION METHOD OR THE STRAIGHT-LINE METHOD, WHICH IS BASED ON ESTIMATED

ASSET SERVICE LIFE TAKING OBSOLESCENCE INTO CONSIDERATION.

ACQUISITION

COSTS OF PROVED PROPERTIES ARE AMORTIZED USING A UNIT-OF-PRODUCTION METHOD,

COMPUTED ON THE BASIS OF TOTAL PROVED OIL AND GAS RESERVES. CAPITALIZED

EXPLORATORY DRILLING AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH PRODUCTIVE

DEPLETABLE EXTRACTIVE PROPERTIES ARE AMORTIZED USING THE UNIT-OF-PRODUCTION

RATES BASED ON THE AMOUNT OF PROVED DEVELOPED RESERVES OF OIL AND GAS THAT ARE

ESTIMATED TO BE RECOVERABLE FROM EXISTING FACILITIES USING CURRENT OPERATING

METHODS. UNDER THE UNIT-OF-PRODUCTION METHOD, OIL AND GAS VOLUMES ARE

CONSIDERED PRODUCED ONCE THEY HAVE BEEN MEASURED THROUGH METERS AT CUSTODY

TRANSFER OR SALES TRANSACTION POINTS AT THE OUTLET VALVE ON THE LEASE OR FIELD

STORAGE TANK. IN THE EVENT THAT THE UNIT-OF-PRODUCTION METHOD DOES NOT RESULT

IN AN EQUITABLE ALLOCATION OF COST OVER THE ECONOMIC LIFE OF AN UPSTREAM ASSET,

AN ALTERNATIVE METHOD IS USED. THE STRAIGHT-LINE METHOD IS USED IN LIMITED

SITUATIONS WHERE THE EXPECTED LIFE OF THE ASSET DOES NOT REASONABLY CORRELATE

WITH THAT OF THE UNDERLYING RESERVES. FOR EXAMPLE, CERTAIN ASSETS USED IN THE

PRODUCTION OF OIL AND NATURAL GAS HAVE A SHORTER LIFE THAN THE RESERVES, AND AS

SUCH, THE CORPORATION USES STRAIGHT-LINE DEPRECIATION TO ENSURE THE ASSET IS

FULLY DEPRECIATED BY THE END OF ITS USEFUL LIFE.

UNDER THE

SEC DEFINITION OF PROVED RESERVES, CERTAIN QUANTITIES OF OIL AND NATURAL GAS

DID NOT QUALIFY AS PROVED RESERVES AT YEAR-END 2016, THE SUBSTANTIAL MAJORITY

OF WHICH RELATES TO THE KEARL OIL SANDS OPERATION, WHERE NO PROVED RESERVES

REMAIN. TO THE EXTENT THAT PROVED RESERVES FOR A PROPERTY ARE ENTIRELY

DE-BOOKED AND THAT PROPERTY CONTINUES TO PRODUCE, ASSETS WILL BE DEPRECIATED

USING A UNIT-OF-PRODUCTION METHOD BASED ON RESERVES DETERMINED AT THE MOST

RECENT SEC PRICE WHICH RESULTS IN A QUANTITY OF PROVED RESERVES GREATER THAN

ZERO, APPROPRIATELY ADJUSTED FOR PRODUCTION AND TECHNICAL CHANGES.

INVESTMENTS

IN REFINERY, CHEMICAL PROCESS, AND LUBES BASESTOCK MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT ARE

GENERALLY DEPRECIATED ON A STRAIGHT‐LINE BASIS OVER A 25-YEAR LIFE.

SERVICE STATION BUILDINGS AND FIXED IMPROVEMENTS GENERALLY ARE DEPRECIATED OVER

A 20-YEAR LIFE. MAINTENANCE AND REPAIRS, INCLUDING PLANNED MAJOR MAINTENANCE,

ARE EXPENSED AS INCURRED. MAJOR RENEWALS AND IMPROVEMENTS ARE CAPITALIZED AND

THE ASSETS REPLACED ARE RETIRED.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

IMPAIRMENT ASSESSMENT.

THE CORPORATION TESTS ASSETS OR GROUPS OF ASSETS FOR

RECOVERABILITY WHENEVER EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THAT THE CARRYING

AMOUNTS MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE. AMONG THE EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES

WHICH COULD INDICATE THAT THE CARRYING VALUE OF AN ASSET OR ASSET GROUP MAY NOT

BE RECOVERABLE ARE THE FOLLOWING.

·

A SIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN THE

MARKET PRICE OF A LONG-LIVED ASSET;

·

A SIGNIFICANT ADVERSE CHANGE IN

THE EXTENT OR MANNER IN WHICH AN ASSET IS BEING USED OR IN ITS PHYSICAL

CONDITION INCLUDING A SIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN CURRENT AND PROJECTED RESERVE

VOLUMES;

·

A SIGNIFICANT ADVERSE CHANGE IN

LEGAL FACTORS OR IN THE BUSINESS CLIMATE THAT COULD AFFECT THE VALUE, INCLUDING

AN ADVERSE ACTION OR ASSESSMENT BY A REGULATOR;

·

AN ACCUMULATION OF PROJECT COSTS

SIGNIFICANTLY IN EXCESS OF THE AMOUNT ORIGINALLY EXPECTED;

·

A CURRENT-PERIOD OPERATING LOSS

COMBINED WITH A HISTORY AND FORECAST OF OPERATING OR CASH FLOW LOSSES; AND

·

A CURRENT EXPECTATION THAT, MORE

LIKELY THAN NOT, A LONG-LIVED ASSET WILL BE SOLD OR OTHERWISE DISPOSED OF

SIGNIFICANTLY BEFORE THE END OF ITS PREVIOUSLY ESTIMATED USEFUL LIFE.

THE

CORPORATION PERFORMS ASSET VALUATION ANALYSES ON AN ONGOING BASIS AS A PART OF

ITS ASSET MANAGEMENT PROGRAM. THESE ANALYSES AND OTHER PROFITABILITY REVIEWS

ASSIST THE CORPORATION IN ASSESSING WHETHER THE CARRYING AMOUNTS OF ANY OF ITS

ASSETS MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE.

IN GENERAL,

THE CORPORATION DOES NOT VIEW TEMPORARILY LOW PRICES OR MARGINS AS AN

INDICATION OF IMPAIRMENT. MANAGEMENT DOES NOT BELIEVE THAT LOWER PRICES ARE

SUSTAINABLE IF ENERGY IS TO BE DELIVERED WITH SUPPLY SECURITY TO MEET GLOBAL

DEMAND OVER THE LONG TERM. ALTHOUGH PRICES WILL OCCASIONALLY DROP SIGNIFICANTLY,

INDUSTRY PRICES OVER THE LONG TERM WILL CONTINUE TO BE DRIVEN BY MARKET SUPPLY

AND DEMAND. ON THE SUPPLY SIDE, INDUSTRY PRODUCTION FROM MATURE FIELDS IS

DECLINING, BUT THIS IS BEING OFFSET BY PRODUCTION FROM NEW DISCOVERIES AND

FIELD DEVELOPMENTS. OPEC PRODUCTION POLICIES ALSO HAVE AN IMPACT ON WORLD OIL

SUPPLIES. THE DEMAND SIDE IS LARGELY A FUNCTION OF GLOBAL ECONOMIC GROWTH.

BECAUSE THE LIFESPANS OF THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE CORPORATION’S MAJOR ASSETS

ARE MEASURED IN DECADES, THE VALUE OF THESE ASSETS IS PREDOMINANTLY BASED ON

LONG-TERM VIEWS OF FUTURE COMMODITY PRICES AND PRODUCTION COSTS. DURING THE

LIFESPAN OF THESE MAJOR ASSETS, THE CORPORATION EXPECTS THAT OIL AND GAS PRICES

WILL EXPERIENCE SIGNIFICANT VOLATILITY, AND CONSEQUENTLY THESE ASSETS WILL

EXPERIENCE PERIODS OF HIGHER EARNINGS AND PERIODS OF LOWER EARNINGS, OR EVEN

LOSSES. IN ASSESSING WHETHER THE EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE

THE CARRYING VALUE OF AN ASSET MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE, THE CORPORATION

CONSIDERS RECENT PERIODS OF OPERATING LOSSES IN THE CONTEXT OF ITS LONGER-TERM

VIEW OF PRICES. WHILE NEAR-TERM PRICES ARE SUBJECT TO WIDE FLUCTUATIONS, LONGER

TERM PRICE VIEWS ARE MORE STABLE AND MEANINGFUL FOR PURPOSES OF ASSESSING

FUTURE CASH FLOWS.

WHEN THE

INDUSTRY EXPERIENCES A PROLONGED AND DEEP REDUCTION IN COMMODITY PRICES, THE

MARKET SUPPLY AND DEMAND CONDITIONS MAY RESULT IN CHANGES TO THE CORPORATION’S

LONG-TERM PRICE OR MARGIN ASSUMPTIONS IT USES FOR ITS CAPITAL INVESTMENT

DECISIONS. TO THE EXTENT THOSE CHANGES RESULT IN A SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN THE

MID-POINT OF ITS LONG-TERM OIL, NATURAL GAS PRICE OR MARGIN RANGES, THE

CORPORATION MAY CONSIDER THAT SITUATION, IN CONJUNCTION WITH OTHER EVENTS AND

CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES SUCH AS A HISTORY OF OPERATING LOSSES, AN INDICATOR OF

POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT FOR CERTAIN ASSETS.

IN THE

UPSTREAM, THE STANDARDIZED MEASURE OF DISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS INCLUDED IN THE

SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION ON OIL AND GAS EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION ACTIVITIES

IS REQUIRED TO USE PRICES BASED ON THE AVERAGE OF FIRST-OF-MONTH PRICES. THESE

PRICES REPRESENT DISCRETE POINTS IN TIME AND COULD BE HIGHER OR LOWER THAN THE

CORPORATION’S LONG-TERM PRICE ASSUMPTIONS WHICH ARE USED FOR IMPAIRMENT

ASSESSMENTS. THE CORPORATION BELIEVES THE STANDARDIZED MEASURE DOES NOT PROVIDE

A RELIABLE ESTIMATE OF THE EXPECTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS TO BE OBTAINED FROM THE

DEVELOPMENT AND PRODUCTION OF ITS OIL AND GAS PROPERTIES OR OF THE VALUE OF ITS

OIL AND GAS RESERVES AND THEREFORE DOES NOT CONSIDER IT RELEVANT IN DETERMINING

WHETHER EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THE NEED FOR AN IMPAIRMENT

ASSESSMENT.

IF EVENTS OR

CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THAT THE CARRYING VALUE MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE, THE

CORPORATION ESTIMATES THE FUTURE UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS OF THE AFFECTED

PROPERTIES TO JUDGE THE RECOVERABILITY OF CARRYING AMOUNTS. IN PERFORMING THIS

ASSESSMENT, ASSETS ARE GROUPED AT THE LOWEST LEVEL FOR WHICH THERE ARE

IDENTIFIABLE CASH FLOWS THAT ARE LARGELY INDEPENDENT OF THE CASH FLOWS OF OTHER

GROUPS OF ASSETS. CASH FLOWS USED IN RECOVERABILITY ASSESSMENTS ARE BASED ON

THE CORPORATION’S ASSUMPTIONS WHICH ARE DEVELOPED IN THE ANNUAL PLANNING AND

BUDGETING PROCESS, AND ARE CONSISTENT WITH THE CRITERIA MANAGEMENT USES TO

EVALUATE INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES. THESE EVALUATIONS MAKE USE OF THE

CORPORATION’S ASSUMPTIONS OF FUTURE CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS COMMODITY PRICES,

REFINING AND CHEMICAL MARGINS, VOLUMES, COSTS, AND FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE

RATES. VOLUMES ARE BASED ON PROJECTED FIELD AND FACILITY PRODUCTION PROFILES,

THROUGHPUT, OR SALES. WHERE UNPROVED RESERVES EXIST, AN APPROPRIATELY

RISK-ADJUSTED AMOUNT OF THESE RESERVES MAY BE INCLUDED IN THE EVALUATION. CASH

FLOW ESTIMATES FOR IMPAIRMENT TESTING EXCLUDE THE EFFECTS OF DERIVATIVE

INSTRUMENTS.

AN ASSET

GROUP IS IMPAIRED IF ITS UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS ARE LESS THAN THE ASSET’S

CARRYING VALUE. IMPAIRMENTS ARE MEASURED BY THE AMOUNT BY WHICH THE CARRYING

VALUE EXCEEDS FAIR VALUE. FAIR VALUE IS BASED ON MARKET PRICES IF AN ACTIVE

MARKET EXISTS FOR THE ASSET GROUP, OR DISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS USING A DISCOUNT

RATE COMMENSURATE WITH THE RISK. SIGNIFICANT UNPROVED PROPERTIES ARE ASSESSED

FOR IMPAIRMENT INDIVIDUALLY, AND VALUATION ALLOWANCES AGAINST THE CAPITALIZED

COSTS ARE RECORDED BASED ON THE ESTIMATED

THE PROPERTIES. PROPERTIES THAT ARE NOT INDIVIDUALLY SIGNIFICANT ARE AGGREGATED

OTHER.

GAINS ON SALES OF PROVED AND UNPROVED PROPERTIES ARE

ONLY RECOGNIZED WHEN THERE IS NEITHER UNCERTAINTY ABOUT THE RECOVERY OF COSTS

APPLICABLE TO ANY INTEREST RETAINED NOR ANY SUBSTANTIAL OBLIGATION FOR FUTURE

PERFORMANCE BY THE CORPORATION. LOSSES ON PROPERTIES SOLD ARE RECOGNIZED WHEN

INCURRED OR WHEN THE PROPERTIES ARE HELD FOR SALE AND THE FAIR VALUE OF THE

PROPERTIES IS LESS THAN THE CARRYING VALUE.

INTEREST

COSTS INCURRED TO FINANCE EXPENDITURES DURING THE CONSTRUCTION PHASE OF

MULTIYEAR PROJECTS ARE CAPITALIZED AS PART OF THE HISTORICAL COST OF ACQUIRING

THE CONSTRUCTED ASSETS. THE PROJECT CONSTRUCTION PHASE COMMENCES WITH THE

DEVELOPMENT OF THE DETAILED ENGINEERING DESIGN AND ENDS WHEN THE CONSTRUCTED

ASSETS ARE READY FOR THEIR INTENDED USE. CAPITALIZED INTEREST COSTS ARE

INCLUDED IN PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT AND ARE DEPRECIATED OVER THE SERVICE

LIFE OF THE RELATED ASSETS.

ASSET

RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS AND ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES

THE CORPORATION

INCURS RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS FOR CERTAIN ASSETS. THE FAIR VALUES OF THESE

OBLIGATIONS ARE RECORDED AS LIABILITIES ON A DISCOUNTED BASIS, WHICH IS

TYPICALLY AT THE TIME THE ASSETS ARE INSTALLED. THE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THESE

LIABILITIES ARE CAPITALIZED AS PART OF THE RELATED ASSETS AND DEPRECIATED. OVER

TIME, THE LIABILITIES ARE ACCRETED FOR THE CHANGE IN THEIR PRESENT VALUE.

LIABILITIES

FOR ENVIRONMENTAL COSTS ARE RECORDED WHEN IT IS PROBABLE THAT OBLIGATIONS HAVE

BEEN INCURRED AND THE AMOUNTS CAN BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED. THESE LIABILITIES

ARE NOT REDUCED BY POSSIBLE RECOVERIES FROM THIRD PARTIES, AND PROJECTED CASH

EXPENDITURES ARE NOT DISCOUNTED.

FOREIGN

CURRENCY TRANSLATION

THE

CORPORATION SELECTS THE FUNCTIONAL REPORTING CURRENCY FOR ITS INTERNATIONAL

SUBSIDIARIES BASED ON THE CURRENCY OF THE PRIMARY ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH

EACH SUBSIDIARY OPERATES.

DOWNSTREAM

AND CHEMICAL OPERATIONS PRIMARILY USE THE LOCAL CURRENCY. HOWEVER, THE U.S.

DOLLAR IS USED IN COUNTRIES WITH A HISTORY OF HIGH INFLATION (PRIMARILY IN

LATIN AMERICA) AND SINGAPORE, WHICH PREDOMINANTLY SELLS INTO THE U.S. DOLLAR

EXPORT MARKET. UPSTREAM OPERATIONS WHICH ARE RELATIVELY SELF-CONTAINED AND

INTEGRATED WITHIN A PARTICULAR COUNTRY, SUCH AS CANADA, THE UNITED KINGDOM,

NORWAY AND CONTINENTAL EUROPE, USE THE LOCAL CURRENCY. SOME UPSTREAM

OPERATIONS, PRIMARILY IN ASIA AND AFRICA, USE THE U.S. DOLLAR BECAUSE THEY

PREDOMINANTLY SELL CRUDE AND NATURAL GAS PRODUCTION INTO U.S.

DOLLAR-DENOMINATED MARKETS.

FOR ALL

OPERATIONS, GAINS OR LOSSES FROM REMEASURING FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSACTIONS INTO

THE FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY ARE INCLUDED IN INCOME.

STOCK-BASED

PAYMENTS

THE

CORPORATION AWARDS STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION TO EMPLOYEES IN THE FORM OF

RESTRICTED STOCK AND RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS. COMPENSATION EXPENSE IS MEASURED

BY THE PRICE OF THE STOCK AT THE DATE OF GRANT AND IS RECOGNIZED IN INCOME OVER

THE REQUISITE SERVICE PERIOD.

2. ACCOUNTING CHANGES

IN

MAY 2014, THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD ISSUED A NEW STANDARD,

REVENUE

FROM CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS

. THE STANDARD ESTABLISHES A SINGLE REVENUE

RECOGNITION MODEL FOR ALL CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS, ELIMINATES INDUSTRY

SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS, AND EXPANDS DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS. THE STANDARD IS

REQUIRED TO BE ADOPTED BEGINNING JANUARY 1, 2018. “SALES AND OTHER OPERATING

REVENUE” ON THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF INCOME INCLUDES SALES, EXCISE AND

VALUE-ADDED TAXES ON SALES TRANSACTIONS. WHEN THE CORPORATION ADOPTS THE

STANDARD, REVENUE WILL EXCLUDE SALES-BASED TAXES COLLECTED ON BEHALF OF THIRD

PARTIES. THIS CHANGE IN REPORTING WILL NOT IMPACT EARNINGS. THE CORPORATION

EXPECTS TO ADOPT THE STANDARD USING THE MODIFIED RETROSPECTIVE METHOD, UNDER

WHICH PRIOR YEARS’ RESULTS ARE NOT RESTATED, BUT SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION ON

THE IMPACT OF THE NEW STANDARD IS PROVIDED FOR 2018 RESULTS. THE CORPORATION

CONTINUES TO EVALUATE OTHER AREAS OF THE STANDARD WHICH ARE NOT EXPECTED TO

HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE CORPORATION’S FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

IN

FEBRUARY 2016, THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD ISSUED A NEW STANDARD,

LEASES.

THE STANDARD REQUIRES THAT ALL LEASES WITH AN INITIAL TERM GREATER THAN ONE

YEAR BE RECORDED ON THE BALANCE SHEET AS A LEASE ASSET AND A LEASE LIABILITY.

THE STANDARD IS REQUIRED TO BE ADOPTED BEGINNING JANUARY 1, 2019, WITH EARLY

ADOPTION PERMITTED. EXXONMOBIL IS EVALUATING THE STANDARD AND ITS EFFECT ON THE

CORPORATION’S FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND PLANS TO ADOPT IT IN 2019.

EFFECTIVE SEPTEMBER 30, 2016, THE

CORPORATION EARLY-ADOPTED ACCOUNTING STANDARD UPDATE NO. 2015-17

INCOME

TAXES (TOPIC 740): BALANCE SHEET CLASSIFICATION OF DEFERRED TAXES

ON A

PROSPECTIVE BASIS. THIS UPDATE ELIMINATES THE REQUIREMENT TO CLASSIFY DEFERRED

TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AS CURRENT AND NONCURRENT, AND INSTEAD REQUIRES ALL

DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES TO BE CLASSIFIED AS NONCURRENT.

5. CASH FLOW INFORMATION

THE

CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS PROVIDES INFORMATION ABOUT CHANGES IN CASH

AND CASH EQUIVALENTS. HIGHLY LIQUID INVESTMENTS WITH MATURITIES OF THREE MONTHS

OR LESS WHEN ACQUIRED ARE CLASSIFIED AS CASH EQUIVALENTS.

FOR

2016, THE “NET (GAIN) ON ASSET SALES” ON THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF CASH

FLOWS INCLUDES BEFORE-TAX AMOUNTS FROM THE SALE OF SERVICE STATIONS IN CANADA,

THE SALE OF UPSTREAM PROPERTIES IN THE U.S., AND THE SALE OF AVIATION FUELING

OPERATIONS ACROSS MULTIPLE COUNTRIES. FOR 2015, THE NUMBER INCLUDES BEFORE-TAX

AMOUNTS FROM THE SALE OF SERVICE STATIONS IN EUROPE, THE SALE OF UPSTREAM

PROPERTIES IN THE U.S., THE SALE OF EXXONMOBIL’S INTERESTS IN CHEMICAL AND

REFINING JOINT VENTURES, AND THE SALE OF THE TORRANCE REFINERY. FOR 2014, THE NUMBER

INCLUDES BEFORE-TAX GAINS FROM THE SALE OF HONG KONG POWER OPERATIONS,

ADDITIONAL PROCEEDS RELATED TO THE 2013 SALE OF A PARTIAL INTEREST IN IRAQ, THE

SALE OF DOWNSTREAM AFFILIATES IN THE CARIBBEAN AND THE SALE OR EXCHANGE OF

UPSTREAM PROPERTIES IN THE U.S., CANADA, AND MALAYSIA. THESE NET GAINS ARE

REPORTED IN “OTHER INCOME” ON THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF INCOME.

IN

2016, THE “ADDITIONS/(REDUCTIONS) IN COMMERCIAL PAPER, AND DEBT WITH THREE

MONTHS OR LESS MATURITY” ON THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS INCLUDES A

NET $608 MILLION ADDITION OF COMMERCIAL PAPER WITH MATURITY OVER THREE MONTHS.

THE GROSS AMOUNT ISSUED WAS $3.9 BILLION, WHILE THE GROSS AMOUNT REPAID WAS $3.3

BILLION. IN 2015, THE NUMBER INCLUDES A NET $358 MILLION ADDITION OF COMMERCIAL

PAPER WITH MATURITY OVER THREE MONTHS. THE GROSS AMOUNT ISSUED WAS $8.1

BILLION, WHILE THE GROSS AMOUNT REPAID WAS $7.7 BILLION.

IN

2015, EXXONMOBIL COMPLETED AN ASSET EXCHANGE THAT RESULTED IN VALUE RECEIVED OF

APPROXIMATELY $500 MILLION INCLUDING $100 MILLION IN CASH. THE NON-CASH

PORTION WAS NOT INCLUDED IN THE “SALES OF SUBSIDIARIES, INVESTMENTS, AND

PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT” OR THE “ALL OTHER ITEMS-NET” LINES ON THE

STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS. CAPITAL LEASES OF APPROXIMATELY $1 BILLION WERE NOT

INCLUDED IN THE “ADDITIONS TO LONG-TERM DEBT” OR “ADDITIONS TO PROPERTY, PLANT AND

EQUIPMENT” LINES ON THE STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS.

IN

2014, EXXONMOBIL COMPLETED ASSET EXCHANGES, PRIMARILY NON-CASH TRANSACTIONS, OF

APPROXIMATELY $1.2 BILLION. THIS AMOUNT IS NOT INCLUDED IN THE “SALES OF

7. EQUITY COMPANY INFORMATION

THE

SUMMARIZED FINANCIAL INFORMATION BELOW INCLUDES AMOUNTS RELATED TO CERTAIN

LESS-THAN-MAJORITY-OWNED COMPANIES AND MAJORITY-OWNED SUBSIDIARIES WHERE

MINORITY SHAREHOLDERS POSSESS THE RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN SIGNIFICANT

MANAGEMENT DECISIONS (SEE NOTE 1). THESE COMPANIES ARE PRIMARILY ENGAGED IN OIL

AND GAS EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION, AND NATURAL GAS MARKETING IN NORTH AMERICA;

NATURAL GAS EXPLORATION, PRODUCTION AND DISTRIBUTION IN EUROPE; AND EXPLORATION,

PRODUCTION, LIQUEFIED NATURAL GAS (LNG) OPERATIONS, REFINING OPERATIONS,

PETROCHEMICAL MANUFACTURING, AND FUEL SALES IN ASIA AND THE MIDDLE EAST. ALSO

INCLUDED ARE SEVERAL REFINING, PETROCHEMICAL MANUFACTURING, AND MARKETING

VENTURES.

THE CORPORATION’S

OWNERSHIP IN THESE VENTURES IS IN THE FORM OF SHARES IN CORPORATE JOINT

VENTURES AS WELL AS INTERESTS IN PARTNERSHIPS. DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE

COMPANY’S CARRYING VALUE OF AN EQUITY INVESTMENT AND ITS UNDERLYING EQUITY IN

THE NET ASSETS OF THE AFFILIATE ARE ASSIGNED TO THE EXTENT PRACTICABLE TO

SPECIFIC ASSETS AND LIABILITIES BASED ON THE COMPANY’S ANALYSIS OF THE FACTORS

GIVING RISE TO THE DIFFERENCE. THE AMORTIZATION OF THIS DIFFERENCE, AS

APPROPRIATE, IS INCLUDED IN “INCOME FROM EQUITY AFFILIATES”.

THE

SHARE OF TOTAL EQUITY COMPANY REVENUES FROM SALES TO EXXONMOBIL

CONSOLIDATED COMPANIES WAS 14 PERCENT, 15 PERCENT AND 14 PERCENT IN THE

YEARS 2016, 2015 AND 2014, RESPECTIVELY.

IN

2013 AND 2014, THE CORPORATION AND ROSNEFT ESTABLISHED VARIOUS ENTITIES TO

CONDUCT EXPLORATION AND RESEARCH ACTIVITIES. PERIODS OF DISPROPORTIONATE

FUNDING WILL RESULT IN THE CORPORATION RECOGNIZING, DURING THE EARLY PHASES OF

THE PROJECTS, AN INVESTMENT THAT IS LARGER THAN ITS EQUITY SHARE IN THESE

ENTITIES. THESE JOINT VENTURES ARE CONSIDERED VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES. HOWEVER,

SINCE THE CORPORATION IS NOT THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY OF THESE ENTITIES, THE

JOINT VENTURES ARE REPORTED AS EQUITY COMPANIES. IN 2014, THE EUROPEAN UNION

AND UNITED STATES IMPOSED SANCTIONS RELATING TO THE RUSSIAN ENERGY SECTOR. WITH

RESPECT TO THE FOREGOING, EACH JOINT VENTURE CONTINUES TO COMPLY WITH ALL APPLICABLE

LAWS, RULES, AND REGULATIONS. THE CORPORATION'S MAXIMUM BEFORE-TAX EXPOSURE TO

LOSS FROM THESE JOINT VENTURES AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2016, IS $1.0 BILLION.

CONTINUED WEAKNESS IN THE UPSTREAM INDUSTRY ENVIRONMENT DURING

2016, CONTINUED WEAK FINANCIAL RESULTS FOR SEVERAL ASSETS IN NORTH AMERICA, AND

A REDUCTION IN THE MID-POINT OF THE RANGES OF THE CORPORATION’S LONG-TERM OIL

AND NATURAL GAS PRICES DEVELOPED AS PART OF ITS ANNUAL PLANNING AND BUDGETING

CYCLE LED THE CORPORATION TO CONCLUDE THAT THE FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES

SUPPORTED PERFORMING AN IMPAIRMENT ASSESSMENT OF CERTAIN LONG-LIVED ASSETS,

NOTABLY NORTH AMERICA NATURAL GAS ASSETS AND CERTAIN OTHER ASSETS ACROSS THE

REMAINDER OF ITS UPSTREAM OPERATIONS. THE ASSESSMENT REFLECTED LONG-TERM CRUDE

AND NATURAL GAS PRICES WHICH ARE CONSISTENT WITH THE MID-POINT OF THE RANGES

THAT MANAGEMENT USES TO EVALUATE INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES AND WHICH ARE IN THE

RANGE OF LONG-TERM PRICE FORECASTS PUBLISHED BY THIRD-PARTY INDUSTRY EXPERTS

AND GOVERNMENT AGENCIES. THIS ASSESSMENT INDICATED THAT THE VAST MAJORITY OF

ASSET GROUPS HAVE FUTURE UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOW ESTIMATES EXCEEDING CARRYING

VALUES. HOWEVER, THE CARRYING VALUES FOR CERTAIN ASSET GROUPS IN THE UNITED

STATES EXCEEDED THE ESTIMATED CASH FLOWS. AS A RESULT, THE CORPORATION’S FOURTH

QUARTER 2016 RESULTS INCLUDE A BEFORE-TAX CHARGE OF $3.3 BILLION TO REDUCE THE

CARRYING VALUE OF THOSE ASSETS TO FAIR VALUE. THE ASSET GROUPS SUBJECT TO THIS

IMPAIRMENT CHARGE ARE PRIMARILY DRY GAS OPERATIONS IN THE ROCKY MOUNTAINS

REGION OF THE UNITED STATES WITH LARGE UNDEVELOPED ACREAGE POSITIONS. THE

IMPAIRMENT CHARGE IS RECOGNIZED IN THE LINE “DEPRECIATION AND DEPLETION” ON THE

CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF INCOME AND RECORDED IN “ACCUMULATED DEPRECIATION AND

DEPLETION”.

THE ASSESSMENT OF FAIR VALUES REQUIRED THE

USE OF LEVEL 3 INPUTS. THE PRINCIPAL PARAMETERS USED TO ESTABLISH FAIR VALUES

INCLUDED ESTIMATES OF BOTH PROVED AND UNPROVED RESERVES, FUTURE COMMODITY

PRICES WHICH WERE CONSISTENT WITH THE AVERAGE OF THIRD-PARTY INDUSTRY EXPERTS

AND GOVERNMENT AGENCIES, DRILLING AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS, DISCOUNT RATES RANGING

FROM 5.5 PERCENT TO 8 PERCENT DEPENDING ON THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE ASSET

GROUP, AND COMPARABLE MARKET TRANSACTIONS. DUE TO THE INHERENT DIFFICULTY IN

PREDICTING FUTURE COMMODITY PRICES, AND THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN INDUSTRY

PRICES AND COSTS, IT IS NOT PRACTICABLE TO REASONABLY ESTIMATE THE EXISTENCE OR

RANGE OF ANY POTENTIAL FUTURE IMPAIRMENT CHARGES RELATED TO THE CORPORATION’S

LONG-LIVED ASSETS.

ACCUMULATED

DEPRECIATION AND DEPLETION TOTALED $209,691 MILLION AT THE END OF 2016 AND $195,732

MILLION AT THE END OF 2015. INTEREST CAPITALIZED IN 2016, 2015 AND 2014 WAS $708

MILLION, $482 MILLION AND $344 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS

THE

CORPORATION INCURS RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS FOR CERTAIN ASSETS. THE FAIR VALUES

OF THESE OBLIGATIONS ARE RECORDED AS LIABILITIES ON A DISCOUNTED BASIS, WHICH

IS TYPICALLY AT THE TIME THE ASSETS ARE INSTALLED. IN THE ESTIMATION OF FAIR

VALUE, THE CORPORATION USES ASSUMPTIONS AND JUDGMENTS REGARDING SUCH FACTORS AS

THE EXISTENCE OF A LEGAL OBLIGATION FOR AN ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATION;

TECHNICAL ASSESSMENTS OF THE ASSETS; ESTIMATED AMOUNTS AND TIMING OF

SETTLEMENTS; DISCOUNT RATES; AND INFLATION RATES. ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS

INCURRED IN THE CURRENT PERIOD WERE LEVEL 3 FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS. THE COSTS

ASSOCIATED WITH THESE LIABILITIES ARE CAPITALIZED AS PART OF THE RELATED ASSETS

AND DEPRECIATED AS THE RESERVES ARE PRODUCED. OVER TIME, THE LIABILITIES ARE

ACCRETED FOR THE CHANGE IN THEIR PRESENT VALUE.

ASSET

RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS FOR DOWNSTREAM AND CHEMICAL FACILITIES GENERALLY BECOME

FIRM AT THE TIME THE FACILITIES ARE PERMANENTLY SHUT DOWN AND DISMANTLED. THESE

OBLIGATIONS MAY INCLUDE THE COSTS OF ASSET DISPOSAL AND ADDITIONAL SOIL REMEDIATION.

HOWEVER, THESE SITES HAVE INDETERMINATE LIVES BASED ON PLANS FOR CONTINUED

OPERATIONS AND AS SUCH, THE FAIR VALUE OF THE CONDITIONAL LEGAL OBLIGATIONS

CANNOT BE MEASURED, SINCE IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO ESTIMATE THE FUTURE SETTLEMENT

DATES OF SUCH OBLIGATIONS.

13. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND DERIVATIVES

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS.

THE FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

IS DETERMINED BY REFERENCE TO OBSERVABLE MARKET DATA AND OTHER VALUATION

TECHNIQUES AS APPROPRIATE. THE ONLY CATEGORY OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WHERE THE

DIFFERENCE BETWEEN FAIR VALUE AND RECORDED BOOK VALUE IS NOTABLE IS LONG-TERM

DEBT. THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF TOTAL LONG-TERM DEBT, EXCLUDING CAPITALIZED

LEASE OBLIGATIONS, WAS $28.0 BILLION AND $18.9 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2016,

AND 2015, RESPECTIVELY, AS COMPARED TO RECORDED BOOK VALUES OF $27.7 BILLION

AND $18.7 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2016, AND 2015, RESPECTIVELY. THE INCREASE IN

THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE AND BOOK VALUE OF LONG-TERM DEBT REFLECTS THE CORPORATION’S

ISSUANCE OF $12.0 BILLION OF LONG-TERM DEBT IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2016.

THE FAIR VALUE OF LONG-TERM DEBT BY

HIERARCHY LEVEL AT DECEMBER 31, 2016, IS: LEVEL 1 $27,825 MILLION; LEVEL 2 $137

MILLION; AND LEVEL 3 $6 MILLION.

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS.

THE CORPORATION’S SIZE, STRONG CAPITAL

STRUCTURE, GEOGRAPHIC DIVERSITY AND THE COMPLEMENTARY NATURE OF THE UPSTREAM,

DOWNSTREAM AND CHEMICAL BUSINESSES REDUCE THE CORPORATION’S ENTERPRISE-WIDE

RISK FROM CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES, CURRENCY RATES AND COMMODITY PRICES. AS A

RESULT, THE CORPORATION MAKES LIMITED USE OF DERIVATIVES TO MITIGATE THE IMPACT

OF SUCH CHANGES. THE CORPORATION DOES NOT ENGAGE IN SPECULATIVE DERIVATIVE

ACTIVITIES OR DERIVATIVE TRADING ACTIVITIES NOR DOES IT USE DERIVATIVES WITH

LEVERAGED FEATURES. WHEN THE CORPORATION DOES ENTER INTO DERIVATIVE

TRANSACTIONS, IT IS TO OFFSET EXPOSURES ASSOCIATED WITH INTEREST RATES, FOREIGN

CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES AND HYDROCARBON PRICES THAT ARISE FROM EXISTING ASSETS,

LIABILITIES AND FORECASTED TRANSACTIONS.

THE

ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS OUTSTANDING AND RECORDED ON THE

BALANCE SHEET WAS A NET LIABILITY OF $22 MILLION AT YEAR-END 2016 AND A NET ASSET

OF $21 MILLION AT YEAR-END 2015. ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ASSOCIATED WITH

DERIVATIVES ARE USUALLY RECORDED EITHER IN “OTHER CURRENT ASSETS” OR “ACCOUNTS PAYABLE

AND ACCRUED LIABILITIES”.

THE

CORPORATION’S FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT OF ITS DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS USE EITHER

LEVEL 1 OR LEVEL 2 INPUTS.

THE

CORPORATION RECOGNIZED A BEFORE-TAX GAIN OR (LOSS) RELATED TO DERIVATIVE

INSTRUMENTS OF $(81) MILLION, $39 MILLION AND $110 MILLION DURING 2016,

2015 AND 2014, RESPECTIVELY. INCOME STATEMENT EFFECTS ASSOCIATED WITH

DERIVATIVES ARE USUALLY RECORDED EITHER IN “SALES AND OTHER OPERATING REVENUE”

OR “CRUDE OIL AND PRODUCT PURCHASES”.

THE

CORPORATION BELIEVES THERE ARE NO MATERIAL MARKET OR CREDIT RISKS TO THE

CORPORATION’S FINANCIAL POSITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR LIQUIDITY AS A

RESULT OF THE DERIVATIVE ACTIVITIES DESCRIBED ABOVE.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

14. LONG-TERM DEBT

AT

DECEMBER 31, 2016, LONG-TERM DEBT CONSISTED OF $28,257 MILLION DUE

IN U.S. DOLLARS AND $675 MILLION REPRESENTING THE U.S. DOLLAR EQUIVALENT

AT YEAR-END EXCHANGE RATES OF AMOUNTS PAYABLE IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES. THESE

AMOUNTS EXCLUDE THAT PORTION OF LONG-TERM DEBT, TOTALING $2,960 MILLION, WHICH

MATURES WITHIN ONE YEAR AND IS INCLUDED IN CURRENT LIABILITIES. THE INCREASE IN

THE BOOK VALUE OF LONG-TERM DEBT REFLECTS THE CORPORATION’S ISSUANCE OF $12.0

BILLION OF LONG‐TERM DEBT IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2016. THE AMOUNTS OF

LONG-TERM DEBT, INCLUDING CAPITALIZED LEASE OBLIGATIONS, MATURING IN EACH OF

THE FOUR YEARS AFTER DECEMBER 31, 2017, IN MILLIONS OF DOLLARS, ARE: 2018

– $4,737; 2019 – $3,886; 2020 – $1,609; AND 2021 – $2,540.

AT DECEMBER 31, 2016, THE CORPORATION’S UNUSED LONG-TERM CREDIT LINES WERE $0.3

15. INCENTIVE PROGRAM

THE 2003 INCENTIVE PROGRAM PROVIDES FOR GRANTS OF STOCK

OPTIONS, STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS (SARS), RESTRICTED STOCK AND OTHER FORMS OF

AWARD. AWARDS MAY BE GRANTED TO ELIGIBLE EMPLOYEES OF THE CORPORATION AND THOSE

AFFILIATES AT LEAST 50 PERCENT OWNED. OUTSTANDING AWARDS ARE SUBJECT TO CERTAIN

FORFEITURE PROVISIONS CONTAINED IN THE PROGRAM OR AWARD INSTRUMENT. OPTIONS AND

SARS MAY BE GRANTED AT PRICES NOT LESS THAN 100 PERCENT OF MARKET VALUE ON THE

DATE OF GRANT AND HAVE A MAXIMUM LIFE OF 10 YEARS. THE MAXIMUM NUMBER OF SHARES

OF STOCK THAT MAY BE ISSUED UNDER THE 2003 INCENTIVE PROGRAM IS 220 MILLION.

AWARDS THAT ARE FORFEITED, EXPIRE OR ARE SETTLED IN CASH, DO NOT COUNT AGAINST

THIS MAXIMUM LIMIT. THE 2003 INCENTIVE PROGRAM DOES NOT HAVE A SPECIFIED TERM.

NEW AWARDS MAY BE MADE UNTIL THE AVAILABLE SHARES ARE DEPLETED, UNLESS THE

BOARD TERMINATES THE PLAN EARLY. AT THE END OF 2016, REMAINING SHARES AVAILABLE

FOR AWARD UNDER THE 2003 INCENTIVE PROGRAM WERE 93

MILLION.

RESTRICTED

STOCK AND RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS.

AWARDS TOTALING 9,583 THOUSAND, 9,681 THOUSAND, AND 9,775 THOUSAND

OF RESTRICTED (NONVESTED) COMMON STOCK UNITS WERE GRANTED IN 2016, 2015 AND 2014,

RESPECTIVELY. COMPENSATION EXPENSE FOR THESE AWARDS IS BASED ON THE PRICE OF

THE STOCK AT THE DATE OF GRANT AND IS RECOGNIZED IN INCOME OVER THE REQUISITE

SERVICE PERIOD. SHARES FOR THESE AWARDS ARE ISSUED TO EMPLOYEES FROM TREASURY

STOCK. THE UNITS THAT ARE SETTLED IN CASH ARE RECORDED AS LIABILITIES AND THEIR

CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE ARE RECOGNIZED OVER THE VESTING PERIOD. DURING THE

APPLICABLE RESTRICTED PERIODS, THE SHARES AND UNITS MAY NOT BE SOLD OR

TRANSFERRED AND ARE SUBJECT TO FORFEITURE. THE MAJORITY OF THE AWARDS HAVE

GRADED VESTING PERIODS, WITH 50 PERCENT OF THE SHARES AND UNITS IN EACH AWARD

VESTING AFTER THREE YEARS AND THE REMAINING 50 PERCENT VESTING AFTER SEVEN

YEARS. AWARDS GRANTED TO A SMALL NUMBER OF SENIOR EXECUTIVES HAVE VESTING

PERIODS OF FIVE YEARS FOR 50 PERCENT OF THE AWARD AND OF 10 YEARS OR

RETIREMENT, WHICHEVER OCCURS LATER, FOR THE REMAINING 50 PERCENT OF THE AWARD.

THE

CORPORATION HAS PURCHASED SHARES IN THE OPEN MARKET AND THROUGH NEGOTIATED

TRANSACTIONS TO OFFSET SHARES OR UNITS SETTLED IN SHARES ISSUED IN CONJUNCTION

WITH BENEFIT PLANS AND PROGRAMS. PURCHASES MAY BE DISCONTINUED AT ANY TIME

WITHOUT PRIOR NOTICE.

16. LITIGATION AND OTHER CONTINGENCIES

LITIGATION.

A VARIETY OF CLAIMS HAVE

BEEN MADE AGAINST EXXONMOBIL AND CERTAIN OF ITS CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES IN A

NUMBER OF PENDING LAWSUITS. MANAGEMENT HAS REGULAR LITIGATION REVIEWS,

INCLUDING UPDATES FROM CORPORATE AND OUTSIDE COUNSEL, TO ASSESS THE NEED FOR ACCOUNTING

RECOGNITION OR DISCLOSURE OF THESE CONTINGENCIES. THE CORPORATION ACCRUES AN

UNDISCOUNTED LIABILITY FOR THOSE CONTINGENCIES WHERE THE INCURRENCE OF A LOSS

IS PROBABLE AND THE AMOUNT CAN BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED. IF A RANGE OF AMOUNTS

CAN BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED AND NO AMOUNT WITHIN THE RANGE IS A BETTER ESTIMATE

THAN ANY OTHER AMOUNT, THEN THE MINIMUM OF THE RANGE IS ACCRUED. THE

CORPORATION DOES NOT RECORD LIABILITIES WHEN THE LIKELIHOOD THAT THE LIABILITY

HAS BEEN INCURRED IS PROBABLE BUT THE AMOUNT CANNOT BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED OR

WHEN THE LIABILITY IS BELIEVED TO BE ONLY REASONABLY POSSIBLE OR REMOTE. FOR

CONTINGENCIES WHERE AN UNFAVORABLE OUTCOME IS REASONABLY POSSIBLE AND WHICH ARE

SIGNIFICANT, THE CORPORATION DISCLOSES THE NATURE OF THE CONTINGENCY AND, WHERE

FEASIBLE, AN ESTIMATE OF THE POSSIBLE LOSS. FOR PURPOSES OF OUR CONTINGENCY

DISCLOSURES, “SIGNIFICANT” INCLUDES MATERIAL MATTERS, AS WELL AS OTHER MATTERS,

WHICH MANAGEMENT BELIEVES SHOULD BE DISCLOSED. EXXONMOBIL WILL CONTINUE TO

DEFEND ITSELF VIGOROUSLY IN THESE MATTERS. BASED ON A CONSIDERATION OF ALL

RELEVANT FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES, THE CORPORATION DOES NOT BELIEVE THE ULTIMATE

OUTCOME OF ANY CURRENTLY PENDING LAWSUIT AGAINST EXXONMOBIL WILL HAVE A

MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT UPON THE CORPORATION’S OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL CONDITION,

OR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS TAKEN AS A WHOLE.

OTHER CONTINGENCIES.

THE CORPORATION AND CERTAIN OF ITS

CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES WERE CONTINGENTLY LIABLE AT DECEMBER 31, 2016,

FOR GUARANTEES RELATING TO NOTES, LOANS AND PERFORMANCE UNDER CONTRACTS. WHERE

GUARANTEES FOR ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION AND OTHER SIMILAR MATTERS DO NOT

INCLUDE A STATED CAP, THE AMOUNTS REFLECT MANAGEMENT’S ESTIMATE OF THE MAXIMUM

POTENTIAL EXPOSURE.

ADDITIONALLY, THE CORPORATION AND ITS AFFILIATES HAVE NUMEROUS

LONG-TERM SALES AND PURCHASE COMMITMENTS IN THEIR VARIOUS BUSINESS ACTIVITIES,

ALL OF WHICH ARE EXPECTED TO BE FULFILLED WITH NO ADVERSE CONSEQUENCES MATERIAL

TO THE CORPORATION’S OPERATIONS OR FINANCIAL CONDITION.

IN ACCORDANCE WITH A NATIONALIZATION

DECREE ISSUED BY VENEZUELA’S PRESIDENT IN FEBRUARY 2007, BY MAY 1, 2007, A

SUBSIDIARY OF THE VENEZUELAN NATIONAL OIL COMPANY (PDVSA) ASSUMED THE

OPERATORSHIP OF THE CERRO NEGRO HEAVY OIL PROJECT. THIS PROJECT HAD BEEN

OPERATED AND OWNED BY EXXONMOBIL AFFILIATES HOLDING A 41.67 PERCENT OWNERSHIP

INTEREST IN THE PROJECT. THE DECREE ALSO REQUIRED CONVERSION OF THE CERRO NEGRO

PROJECT INTO A “MIXED ENTERPRISE” AND AN INCREASE IN PDVSA’S OR ONE OF ITS

AFFILIATE’S OWNERSHIP INTEREST IN THE PROJECT, WITH THE STIPULATION THAT IF

EXXONMOBIL REFUSED TO ACCEPT THE TERMS FOR THE FORMATION OF THE MIXED

ENTERPRISE WITHIN A SPECIFIED PERIOD OF TIME, THE GOVERNMENT WOULD “DIRECTLY

ASSUME THE ACTIVITIES” CARRIED OUT BY THE JOINT VENTURE. EXXONMOBIL REFUSED TO

ACCEDE TO THE TERMS PROFFERED BY THE GOVERNMENT, AND ON JUNE 27, 2007, THE

GOVERNMENT EXPROPRIATED EXXONMOBIL’S 41.67 PERCENT INTEREST IN THE CERRO NEGRO

PROJECT.

ON SEPTEMBER 6, 2007, AFFILIATES OF

EXXONMOBIL FILED A REQUEST FOR ARBITRATION WITH THE INTERNATIONAL CENTRE FOR

SETTLEMENT OF INVESTMENT DISPUTES (ICSID). THE ICSID TRIBUNAL ISSUED A DECISION

ON JUNE 10, 2010, FINDING THAT IT HAD JURISDICTION TO PROCEED ON THE BASIS OF

THE NETHERLANDS-VENEZUELA BILATERAL INVESTMENT TREATY. ON OCTOBER 9, 2014, THE

ICSID TRIBUNAL ISSUED ITS FINAL AWARD FINDING IN FAVOR OF THE EXXONMOBIL

AFFILIATES AND AWARDING $1.6 BILLION AS OF THE DATE OF EXPROPRIATION, JUNE 27,

2007, AND INTEREST FROM THAT DATE AT 3.25% COMPOUNDED ANNUALLY UNTIL THE DATE

OF PAYMENT IN FULL. THE TRIBUNAL ALSO NOTED THAT ONE OF THE CERRO NEGRO PROJECT

AGREEMENTS PROVIDES A MECHANISM TO PREVENT DOUBLE RECOVERY BETWEEN THE ICSID

AWARD AND ALL OR PART OF AN EARLIER AWARD OF $908 MILLION TO AN EXXONMOBIL

AFFILIATE, MOBIL CERRO NEGRO, LTD., AGAINST PDVSA AND A PDVSA AFFILIATE, PDVSA

CN, IN AN ARBITRATION UNDER THE RULES OF THE INTERNATIONAL CHAMBER OF COMMERCE.

ON

JUNE 12, 2015, THE TRIBUNAL REJECTED IN ITS ENTIRETY VENEZUELA’S OCTOBER 23,

2014, APPLICATION TO REVISE THE ICSID AWARD. THE TRIBUNAL ALSO LIFTED THE

ASSOCIATED STAY OF ENFORCEMENT THAT HAD BEEN ENTERED UPON THE FILING OF THE

APPLICATION TO REVISE.

STILL

PENDING IS VENEZUELA’S FEBRUARY 2, 2015, APPLICATION TO ICSID SEEKING ANNULMENT

OF THE ICSID AWARD. THAT APPLICATION ALLEGES THAT, IN ISSUING THE ICSID AWARD,

THE TRIBUNAL EXCEEDED ITS POWERS, FAILED TO STATE REASONS ON WHICH THE ICSID

AWARD WAS BASED, AND DEPARTED FROM A FUNDAMENTAL RULE OF PROCEDURE. A SEPARATE

STAY OF THE ICSID AWARD WAS ENTERED FOLLOWING THE FILING OF THE ANNULMENT

APPLICATION. ON JULY 7, 2015, THE ICSID COMMITTEE CONSIDERING THE ANNULMENT APPLICATION

HEARD ARGUMENTS FROM THE PARTIES ON WHETHER TO LIFT THE STAY OF THE AWARD

ASSOCIATED WITH THAT APPLICATION. ON JULY 28, 2015, THE COMMITTEE ISSUED AN

ORDER THAT WOULD LIFT THE STAY OF ENFORCEMENT UNLESS, WITHIN 30 DAYS, VENEZUELA

DELIVERED A COMMITMENT TO PAY THE AWARD IF THE

87

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

APPLICATION

TO ANNUL IS DENIED. ON SEPTEMBER 17, 2015, THE COMMITTEE RULED THAT VENEZUELA

HAD COMPLIED WITH THE REQUIREMENT TO SUBMIT A WRITTEN COMMITMENT TO PAY THE

AWARD AND SO LEFT THE STAY OF ENFORCEMENT IN PLACE. A HEARING ON VENEZUELA’S

APPLICATION FOR ANNULMENT WAS HELD MARCH 8-9, 2016.

THE

UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK ENTERED

JUDGMENT ON THE ICSID AWARD ON OCTOBER 10, 2014. MOTIONS FILED BY VENEZUELA TO

VACATE THAT JUDGMENT ON PROCEDURAL GROUNDS AND TO MODIFY THE JUDGMENT BY

REDUCING THE RATE OF INTEREST TO BE PAID ON THE ICSID AWARD FROM THE ENTRY OF

THE COURT’S JUDGMENT, UNTIL THE DATE OF PAYMENT, WERE DENIED ON FEBRUARY 13,

2015, AND MARCH 4, 2015, RESPECTIVELY. ON MARCH 9, 2015, VENEZUELA FILED A NOTICE

OF APPEAL OF THE COURT’S ACTIONS ON THE TWO MOTIONS. ORAL ARGUMENTS ON THIS

APPEAL WERE HELD BEFORE THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE SECOND

CIRCUIT ON JANUARY 7, 2016.

THE

DISTRICT COURT’S JUDGMENT ON THE ICSID AWARD IS CURRENTLY STAYED UNTIL SUCH

TIME AS ICSID’S STAY OF THE AWARD ENTERED FOLLOWING VENEZUELA’S FILING OF ITS

APPLICATION TO ANNUL HAS BEEN LIFTED. THE NET IMPACT OF THESE MATTERS ON THE

CORPORATION’S CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL RESULTS CANNOT BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED.

REGARDLESS, THE CORPORATION DOES NOT EXPECT THE RESOLUTION TO HAVE A MATERIAL

EFFECT UPON THE CORPORATION’S OPERATIONS OR FINANCIAL CONDITION.

AN AFFILIATE OF EXXONMOBIL IS ONE OF THE CONTRACTORS UNDER

A PRODUCTION SHARING CONTRACT (PSC) WITH THE NIGERIAN NATIONAL PETROLEUM

CORPORATION (NNPC) COVERING THE ERHA BLOCK LOCATED IN THE OFFSHORE WATERS OF

NIGERIA. EXXONMOBIL'S AFFILIATE IS THE OPERATOR OF THE BLOCK AND OWNS A 56.25

PERCENT INTEREST UNDER THE PSC. THE CONTRACTORS ARE IN DISPUTE WITH NNPC

REGARDING NNPC'S LIFTING OF CRUDE OIL IN EXCESS OF ITS ENTITLEMENT UNDER THE

TERMS OF THE PSC. IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE TERMS OF THE PSC, THE CONTRACTORS

INITIATED ARBITRATION IN ABUJA, NIGERIA, UNDER THE NIGERIAN ARBITRATION AND

CONCILIATION ACT. ON OCTOBER 24, 2011, A THREE-MEMBER ARBITRAL TRIBUNAL ISSUED

AN AWARD UPHOLDING THE CONTRACTORS' POSITION IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS AND

AWARDING DAMAGES TO THE CONTRACTORS JOINTLY IN AN AMOUNT OF APPROXIMATELY $1.8

BILLION PLUS $234 MILLION IN ACCRUED INTEREST. THE CONTRACTORS PETITIONED A

NIGERIAN FEDERAL COURT FOR ENFORCEMENT OF THE AWARD, AND NNPC PETITIONED THE

SAME COURT TO HAVE THE AWARD SET ASIDE. ON MAY 22, 2012, THE COURT SET ASIDE

THE AWARD. THE CONTRACTORS APPEALED THAT JUDGMENT TO THE COURT OF APPEAL, ABUJA

JUDICIAL DIVISION. ON JULY 22, 2016, THE COURT OF APPEAL UPHELD THE DECISION OF

THE LOWER COURT SETTING ASIDE THE AWARD. ON OCTOBER 21, 2016, THE CONTRACTORS

APPEALED THE DECISION TO THE SUPREME COURT OF NIGERIA. IN JUNE 2013, THE

CONTRACTORS FILED A LAWSUIT AGAINST NNPC IN THE NIGERIAN FEDERAL HIGH COURT IN

ORDER TO PRESERVE THEIR ABILITY TO SEEK ENFORCEMENT OF THE PSC IN THE COURTS IF

NECESSARY. IN OCTOBER 2014, THE CONTRACTORS FILED SUIT IN THE UNITED STATES

DISTRICT COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK TO ENFORCE, IF NECESSARY,

THE ARBITRATION AWARD AGAINST NNPC ASSETS RESIDING WITHIN THAT JURISDICTION.

NNPC HAS MOVED TO DISMISS THE LAWSUIT. THE STAY IN THE PROCEEDINGS IN THE

SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK HAS BEEN LIFTED. AT THIS TIME, THE NET IMPACT OF

THIS MATTER ON THE CORPORATION'S CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL RESULTS CANNOT BE

REASONABLY ESTIMATED. HOWEVER, REGARDLESS OF THE OUTCOME OF ENFORCEMENT

PROCEEDINGS, THE CORPORATION DOES NOT EXPECT THE PROCEEDINGS TO HAVE A MATERIAL

EFFECT UPON THE CORPORATION'S OPERATIONS OR FINANCIAL CONDITION.

FOR 2016 AND 2015, OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS PAID ARE

NET OF $22 MILLION AND $15 MILLION OF MEDICARE SUBSIDY RECEIPTS, RESPECTIVELY.

FOR SELECTION OF THE DISCOUNT RATE FOR

U.S. PLANS, SEVERAL SOURCES OF INFORMATION ARE CONSIDERED, INCLUDING INTEREST

RATE MARKET INDICATORS AND THE DISCOUNT RATE DETERMINED BY USE OF A YIELD CURVE

BASED ON HIGH-QUALITY, NONCALLABLE BONDS WITH CASH FLOWS THAT MATCH ESTIMATED

OUTFLOWS FOR BENEFIT PAYMENTS. FOR MAJOR NON-U.S. PLANS, THE DISCOUNT RATE IS

DETERMINED BY USING BOND PORTFOLIOS WITH AN AVERAGE MATURITY APPROXIMATING THAT

OF THE LIABILITIES OR SPOT YIELD CURVES, BOTH OF WHICH ARE CONSTRUCTED

USING HIGH-QUALITY, LOCAL-CURRENCY-DENOMINATED BONDS.

THE MEASUREMENT OF THE ACCUMULATED

POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATION ASSUMES A HEALTH CARE COST TREND RATE OF 4.5

PERCENT IN 2018 AND SUBSEQUENT YEARS. A ONE-PERCENTAGE-POINT INCREASE IN THE HEALTH

CARE COST TREND RATE WOULD INCREASE SERVICE AND INTEREST COST BY $76 MILLION

AND THE POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATION BY $862 MILLION. A

ONE-PERCENTAGE-POINT DECREASE IN THE HEALTH CARE COST TREND RATE WOULD DECREASE

SERVICE AND INTEREST COST BY $58 MILLION AND THE POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT

OBLIGATION BY $687 MILLION.

THE CORPORATION’S INVESTMENT STRATEGY FOR

BENEFIT PLAN ASSETS REFLECTS A LONG-TERM VIEW, A CAREFUL ASSESSMENT OF THE

RISKS INHERENT IN VARIOUS ASSET CLASSES AND BROAD DIVERSIFICATION TO REDUCE THE

RISK OF THE PORTFOLIO. THE BENEFIT PLAN ASSETS ARE PRIMARILY INVESTED IN

PASSIVE EQUITY AND FIXED INCOME INDEX FUNDS TO DIVERSIFY RISK WHILE

MINIMIZING COSTS. THE EQUITY FUNDS HOLD EXXONMOBIL STOCK ONLY TO THE EXTENT

NECESSARY TO REPLICATE THE RELEVANT EQUITY INDEX. THE FIXED INCOME FUNDS ARE

LARGELY INVESTED IN HIGH-QUALITY CORPORATE AND GOVERNMENT DEBT SECURITIES.

STUDIES

ARE PERIODICALLY CONDUCTED TO ESTABLISH THE PREFERRED TARGET ASSET ALLOCATION

PERCENTAGES. THE TARGET ASSET ALLOCATION FOR THE U.S. BENEFIT PLANS AND THE MAJOR

NON-U.S. PLANS IS 40 PERCENT EQUITY SECURITIES AND 60 PERCENT DEBT SECURITIES.

THE EQUITY TARGETS FOR THE U.S. AND NON-U.S. PLANS INCLUDE AN ALLOCATION TO

PRIVATE EQUITY PARTNERSHIPS THAT PRIMARILY FOCUS ON EARLY-STAGE VENTURE CAPITAL

OF 5 PERCENT AND 3 PERCENT, RESPECTIVELY.

THE

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT LEVELS ARE ACCOUNTING TERMS THAT REFER TO DIFFERENT

METHODS OF VALUING ASSETS. THE TERMS DO NOT REPRESENT THE RELATIVE RISK OR

CREDIT QUALITY OF AN INVESTMENT.

INFORMATION

THE

UPSTREAM, DOWNSTREAM AND CHEMICAL FUNCTIONS BEST DEFINE THE OPERATING SEGMENTS

OF THE BUSINESS THAT ARE REPORTED SEPARATELY. THE FACTORS USED TO IDENTIFY

THESE REPORTABLE SEGMENTS ARE BASED ON THE NATURE OF THE OPERATIONS THAT ARE

UNDERTAKEN BY EACH SEGMENT. THE UPSTREAM SEGMENT IS ORGANIZED AND OPERATES TO

EXPLORE FOR AND PRODUCE CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS. THE DOWNSTREAM SEGMENT IS

ORGANIZED AND OPERATES TO MANUFACTURE AND SELL PETROLEUM PRODUCTS. THE CHEMICAL

SEGMENT IS ORGANIZED AND OPERATES TO MANUFACTURE AND SELL PETROCHEMICALS. THESE

SEGMENTS ARE BROADLY UNDERSTOOD ACROSS THE PETROLEUM AND PETROCHEMICAL

INDUSTRIES.

THESE

FUNCTIONS HAVE BEEN DEFINED AS THE OPERATING SEGMENTS OF THE CORPORATION

BECAUSE THEY ARE THE SEGMENTS (1) THAT ENGAGE IN BUSINESS ACTIVITIES FROM

WHICH REVENUES ARE EARNED AND EXPENSES ARE INCURRED; (2) WHOSE OPERATING

RESULTS ARE REGULARLY REVIEWED BY THE CORPORATION’S CHIEF OPERATING DECISION

MAKER TO MAKE DECISIONS ABOUT RESOURCES TO BE ALLOCATED TO THE SEGMENT AND TO

ASSESS ITS PERFORMANCE; AND (3) FOR WHICH DISCRETE FINANCIAL INFORMATION

IS AVAILABLE.

EARNINGS

AFTER INCOME TAX INCLUDE TRANSFERS AT ESTIMATED MARKET PRICES.

97

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

IN CORPORATE AND FINANCING ACTIVITIES,

INTEREST REVENUE RELATES TO INTEREST EARNED ON CASH DEPOSITS AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES.

INTEREST EXPENSE INCLUDES NON-DEBT-RELATED INTEREST EXPENSE OF $63 MILLION

THE CORPORATION HAD $54 BILLION OF

OUTSIDE THE U.S. THAT WERE RETAINED TO FUND PRIOR AND FUTURE CAPITAL PROJECT

EXPENDITURES. DEFERRED TAXES HAVE NOT BEEN RECORDED FOR POTENTIAL FUTURE TAX

OBLIGATIONS AS THESE EARNINGS ARE EXPECTED TO BE INDEFINITELY REINVESTED FOR

THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2016, IT IS NOT PRACTICAL TO

ESTIMATE THE UNRECOGNIZED DEFERRED TAX LIABILITY ASSOCIATED WITH THESE EARNINGS

GIVEN THE FUTURE AVAILABILITY OF FOREIGN TAX CREDITS AND UNCERTAINTIES ABOUT THE

THE GROSS UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFIT

BALANCES SHOWN ABOVE ARE PREDOMINANTLY RELATED TO TAX POSITIONS THAT WOULD

REDUCE THE CORPORATION’S EFFECTIVE TAX RATE IF THE POSITIONS ARE FAVORABLY

RESOLVED. UNFAVORABLE RESOLUTION OF THESE TAX POSITIONS GENERALLY WOULD NOT

INCREASE THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE. THE 2016, 2015 AND 2014 CHANGES IN

UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS DID NOT HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE CORPORATION’S

NET INCOME.

RESOLUTION

OF THESE TAX POSITIONS THROUGH NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE RELEVANT TAX AUTHORITIES

OR THROUGH LITIGATION WILL TAKE MANY YEARS TO COMPLETE. IT IS DIFFICULT TO

PREDICT THE TIMING OF RESOLUTION FOR TAX POSITIONS SINCE SUCH TIMING IS NOT

ENTIRELY WITHIN THE CONTROL OF THE CORPORATION. IN THE UNITED STATES, THE

CORPORATION HAS VARIOUS ONGOING U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX POSITIONS AT ISSUE WITH

THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE (IRS) FOR TAX YEARS BEGINNING IN 2006. THE IRS HAS

ASSERTED PENALTIES ASSOCIATED WITH SEVERAL OF THOSE POSITIONS. THE CORPORATION

HAS NOT RECOGNIZED THE PENALTIES AS AN EXPENSE BECAUSE THE CORPORATION DOES NOT

EXPECT THE PENALTIES TO BE SUSTAINED UNDER APPLICABLE LAW. THE CORPORATION HAS

FILED A REFUND SUIT FOR TAX YEARS 2006-2009 IN A U.S. FEDERAL DISTRICT COURT

WITH RESPECT TO THE POSITIONS AT ISSUE FOR THOSE YEARS. UNFAVORABLE RESOLUTION

OF ALL POSITIONS AT ISSUE WITH THE IRS WOULD NOT HAVE A MATERIALLY ADVERSE

EFFECT ON THE CORPORATION’S NET INCOME OR LIQUIDITY.

IT

IS REASONABLY POSSIBLE THAT THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS COULD

CHANGE IN THE NEXT 12 MONTHS IN A RANGE FROM A DECREASE OF 10 PERCENT TO AN INCREASE

OF UP TO 15 PERCENT, WITH NO MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE CORPORATION’S NET INCOME.

EVENTS

THE CORPORATION

COMPLETED THE ACQUISITION OF INTEROIL CORPORATION (IOC) FOR ABOUT $2.5 BILLION

ON FEBRUARY 22, 2017. IOC IS AN EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION BUSINESS FOCUSED ON

PAPUA NEW GUINEA. CONSIDERATION INCLUDES AROUND 28 MILLION SHARES OF EXXON

MOBIL CORPORATION COMMON STOCK WITH AN ESTIMATED VALUE OF $2.3 BILLION, A

CONTINGENT RESOURCE PAYMENT (CRP) AND CASH. THE CRP PROVIDES IOC SHAREHOLDERS

$7.07 PER SHARE IN CASH FOR EACH INCREMENTAL CERTIFIED TRILLION CUBIC FEET

EQUIVALENT (TCFE) OF RESOURCES ABOVE 6.2 TCFE, AND UP TO 11.0 TCFE. IOC’S

ASSETS INCLUDE A RECEIVABLE RELATED TO THE SAME RESOURCE BASE FOR VOLUMES IN

EXCESS OF 3.5 TCFE AT AMOUNTS RANGING FROM $0.24 - $0.40 PER THOUSAND CUBIC

FEET EQUIVALENT. THE RECEIVABLE IS EXPECTED TO MORE THAN COVER THE CRP.

ON JANUARY 16, 2017, AN AFFILIATE OF THE

CORPORATION ENTERED INTO A PURCHASE AND SALE AGREEMENT WITH THE BASS FAMILY OF

FORT WORTH, TEXAS, TO ACQUIRE COMPANIES THAT INDIRECTLY OWN CERTAIN OIL AND GAS

PROPERTIES IN THE PERMIAN BASIN AND CERTAIN ADDITIONAL PROPERTIES AND RELATED

ASSETS IN EXCHANGE FOR SHARES OF EXXON MOBIL CORPORATION COMMON STOCK HAVING AN

AGGREGATE VALUE AT THE TIME OF CLOSING OF $5.6 BILLION, TOGETHER WITH

ADDITIONAL CONTINGENT CASH PAYMENTS TIED TO FUTURE DRILLING AND COMPLETION

ACTIVITIES (UP TO A MAXIMUM OF $1.02 BILLION). THE TRANSACTION IS CURRENTLY

EXPECTED TO CLOSE ON OR ABOUT FEBRUARY 28, 2017. AS OF JANUARY 16, 2017,

THE NUMBER OF SHARES ISSUABLE IN CONNECTION WITH THE TRANSACTION WOULD HAVE

BEEN APPROXIMATELY 63 MILLION.

THE AMOUNTS SHOWN FOR NET CAPITALIZED COSTS OF CONSOLIDATED

SUBSIDIARIES ARE $15,239 MILLION LESS AT YEAR-END 2016 AND $14,685 MILLION

LESS AT YEAR-END 2015 THAN THE AMOUNTS REPORTED AS INVESTMENTS IN PROPERTY,

PLANT AND EQUIPMENT FOR THE UPSTREAM IN NOTE 9. THIS IS DUE TO THE

EXCLUSION FROM CAPITALIZED COSTS OF CERTAIN TRANSPORTATION AND RESEARCH ASSETS

AND ASSETS RELATING TO LNG OPERATIONS. ASSETS RELATED TO OIL SANDS AND OIL

SHALE MINING OPERATIONS ARE INCLUDED IN THE CAPITALIZED COSTS IN ACCORDANCE

WITH FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD RULES.

OIL AND

GAS RESERVES

THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION DESCRIBES CHANGES DURING THE

YEARS AND BALANCES OF PROVED OIL AND GAS RESERVES AT YEAR-END 2014, 2015, AND

2016.

THE

DEFINITIONS USED ARE IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE

COMMISSION’S RULE 4-10 (A) OF REGULATION S-X.

PROVED

OIL AND NATURAL GAS RESERVES ARE THOSE QUANTITIES OF OIL AND NATURAL GAS,

WHICH, BY ANALYSIS OF GEOSCIENCE AND ENGINEERING DATA, CAN BE ESTIMATED WITH

REASONABLE CERTAINTY TO BE ECONOMICALLY PRODUCIBLE – FROM A GIVEN DATE FORWARD,

FROM KNOWN RESERVOIRS, AND UNDER EXISTING ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, OPERATING

METHODS AND GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS – PRIOR TO THE TIME AT WHICH CONTRACTS

PROVIDING THE RIGHT TO OPERATE EXPIRE, UNLESS EVIDENCE INDICATES THAT RENEWAL

IS REASONABLY CERTAIN. IN SOME CASES, SUBSTANTIAL NEW INVESTMENTS IN ADDITIONAL

WELLS AND RELATED FACILITIES WILL BE REQUIRED TO RECOVER THESE PROVED RESERVES.

IN

ACCORDANCE WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION’S (SEC) RULES, THE

CORPORATION’S YEAR-END RESERVES VOLUMES AS WELL AS THE RESERVES CHANGE

CATEGORIES SHOWN IN THE FOLLOWING TABLES ARE REQUIRED TO BE CALCULATED ON THE

BASIS OF AVERAGE PRICES DURING THE 12-MONTH PERIOD PRIOR TO THE ENDING DATE OF

THE PERIOD COVERED BY THE REPORT, DETERMINED AS AN UNWEIGHTED ARITHMETIC AVERAGE

OF THE FIRST-DAY-OF-THE-MONTH PRICE FOR EACH MONTH WITHIN SUCH PERIOD. THESE

RESERVES QUANTITIES ARE ALSO USED IN CALCULATING UNIT‐OF-PRODUCTION

DEPRECIATION RATES AND IN CALCULATING THE STANDARDIZED MEASURE OF DISCOUNTED

NET CASH FLOW.

REVISIONS

CAN INCLUDE UPWARD OR DOWNWARD CHANGES IN PREVIOUSLY ESTIMATED VOLUMES OF

PROVED RESERVES FOR EXISTING FIELDS DUE TO THE EVALUATION OR RE-EVALUATION OF

(1) ALREADY AVAILABLE GEOLOGIC, RESERVOIR OR PRODUCTION DATA, (2) NEW

GEOLOGIC, RESERVOIR OR PRODUCTION DATA OR (3) CHANGES IN THE AVERAGE OF

FIRST-OF-MONTH OIL AND NATURAL GAS PRICES AND / OR COSTS THAT ARE USED IN THE

ESTIMATION OF RESERVES. REVISIONS CAN ALSO RESULT FROM SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN

EITHER DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY OR PRODUCTION EQUIPMENT/FACILITY CAPACITY. RESERVE

VOLUMES THAT WERE SUBJECT TO A DOWNWARD REVISION CAN BE REVISED UPWARD AT SOME

POINT IN THE FUTURE WHEN PRICE LEVELS INCREASE, COSTS DECLINE, AND / OR

OPERATING EFFICIENCIES OCCUR.

AS A

RESULT OF VERY LOW PRICES DURING 2016, UNDER THE SEC DEFINITION OF PROVED

RESERVES, CERTAIN QUANTITIES OF OIL AND NATURAL GAS THAT QUALIFIED AS PROVED

RESERVES IN PRIOR YEARS DID NOT QUALIFY AS PROVED RESERVES AT YEAR‐END

2016 AND ARE REFLECTED AS DOWNWARD REVISIONS. AMOUNTS NO LONGER QUALIFYING AS

PROVED RESERVES INCLUDE THE ENTIRE 3.5 BILLION BARRELS OF BITUMEN AT KEARL. IN

ADDITION, 0.8 BILLION BARRELS OF OIL EQUIVALENT ACROSS THE REMAINDER OF NORTH

AMERICA NO LONGER QUALIFY AS PROVED RESERVES MAINLY DUE TO THE ACCELERATION OF

THE PROJECTED END-OF-FIELD-LIFE.

AMONG THE FACTORS THAT WOULD RESULT IN THESE AMOUNTS BEING

RECOGNIZED AGAIN AS PROVED RESERVES AT SOME POINT IN THE FUTURE ARE A RECOVERY

IN AVERAGE PRICE LEVELS, A FURTHER DECLINE IN COSTS, AND / OR OPERATING

EFFICIENCIES.

WE DO NOT

EXPECT THE DOWNWARD REVISION OF REPORTED PROVED RESERVES UNDER SEC DEFINITIONS

TO AFFECT THE OPERATION OF THE UNDERLYING PROJECTS OR TO ALTER OUR OUTLOOK FOR

FUTURE PRODUCTION VOLUMES.

PROVED

RESERVES INCLUDE 100 PERCENT OF EACH MAJORITY-OWNED AFFILIATE’S PARTICIPATION

IN PROVED RESERVES AND EXXONMOBIL’S OWNERSHIP PERCENTAGE OF THE PROVED RESERVES

OF EQUITY COMPANIES, BUT EXCLUDE ROYALTIES AND QUANTITIES DUE OTHERS. NATURAL GAS

RESERVES EXCLUDE THE GASEOUS EQUIVALENT OF LIQUIDS EXPECTED TO BE REMOVED FROM

THE NATURAL GAS ON LEASES, AT FIELD FACILITIES AND AT GAS PROCESSING PLANTS.

THESE LIQUIDS ARE INCLUDED IN NET PROVED RESERVES OF CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS

LIQUIDS.

IN

THE PROVED RESERVES TABLES, CONSOLIDATED RESERVES AND EQUITY COMPANY RESERVES

ARE REPORTED SEPARATELY. HOWEVER, THE CORPORATION DOES NOT VIEW EQUITY COMPANY

RESERVES ANY DIFFERENTLY THAN THOSE FROM CONSOLIDATED COMPANIES.

RESERVES

REPORTED UNDER PRODUCTION SHARING AND OTHER NONCONCESSIONARY AGREEMENTS ARE

BASED ON THE ECONOMIC INTEREST AS DEFINED BY THE SPECIFIC FISCAL TERMS IN THE

AGREEMENT. THE PRODUCTION AND RESERVES THAT WE REPORT FOR THESE TYPES OF

ARRANGEMENTS TYPICALLY VARY INVERSELY WITH OIL AND NATURAL GAS PRICE CHANGES.

AS OIL AND NATURAL GAS PRICES INCREASE, THE CASH FLOW AND VALUE RECEIVED BY THE

COMPANY INCREASE; HOWEVER, THE PRODUCTION VOLUMES AND RESERVES REQUIRED TO

ACHIEVE THIS VALUE WILL TYPICALLY BE LOWER BECAUSE OF THE HIGHER PRICES. WHEN

PRICES DECREASE, THE OPPOSITE EFFECT GENERALLY OCCURS. THE PERCENTAGE OF TOTAL

LIQUIDS AND NATURAL GAS PROVED RESERVES (CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES PLUS EQUITY

COMPANIES) AT YEAR-END 2016 THAT WERE ASSOCIATED WITH PRODUCTION SHARING

CONTRACT ARRANGEMENTS WAS 14 PERCENT OF LIQUIDS, 9 PERCENT OF NATURAL GAS AND 12

PERCENT ON AN OIL-EQUIVALENT BASIS (NATURAL GAS CONVERTED TO OIL-EQUIVALENT AT

6 BILLION CUBIC FEET = 1 MILLION BARRELS).

NET

PROVED DEVELOPED RESERVES ARE THOSE VOLUMES THAT ARE EXPECTED TO BE RECOVERED

THROUGH EXISTING WELLS WITH EXISTING EQUIPMENT AND OPERATING METHODS OR IN

WHICH THE COST OF THE REQUIRED EQUIPMENT IS RELATIVELY MINOR COMPARED TO THE

COST OF A NEW WELL. NET PROVED UNDEVELOPED RESERVES ARE THOSE VOLUMES THAT ARE

EXPECTED TO BE RECOVERED FROM NEW WELLS ON UNDRILLED ACREAGE, OR FROM EXISTING

WELLS WHERE A RELATIVELY MAJOR EXPENDITURE IS REQUIRED FOR RECOMPLETION.

CRUDE

OIL AND NATURAL GAS LIQUIDS AND NATURAL GAS PRODUCTION QUANTITIES SHOWN ARE THE

NET VOLUMES WITHDRAWN FROM EXXONMOBIL’S OIL AND NATURAL GAS RESERVES. THE

NATURAL GAS QUANTITIES DIFFER FROM THE QUANTITIES OF NATURAL GAS DELIVERED FOR

SALE BY THE PRODUCING FUNCTION AS REPORTED IN THE OPERATING INFORMATION DUE TO

VOLUMES CONSUMED OR FLARED AND INVENTORY CHANGES.

STANDARDIZED MEASURE OF DISCOUNTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS

AS REQUIRED BY THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING

STANDARDS BOARD, THE STANDARDIZED MEASURE OF DISCOUNTED FUTURE NET CASH FLOWS

IS COMPUTED BY APPLYING FIRST-DAY-OF-THE-MONTH AVERAGE PRICES,

YEAR-END COSTS AND LEGISLATED TAX RATES AND A DISCOUNT FACTOR OF 10 PERCENT

TO NET PROVED RESERVES. THE STANDARDIZED MEASURE INCLUDES COSTS FOR

FUTURE DISMANTLEMENT, ABANDONMENT AND REHABILITATION OBLIGATIONS.

THE CORPORATION BELIEVES THE STANDARDIZED MEASURE DOES NOT PROVIDE

A RELIABLE ESTIMATE OF THE CORPORATION’S EXPECTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS TO BE

OBTAINED FROM THE DEVELOPMENT AND PRODUCTION OF ITS OIL AND GAS PROPERTIES OR

OF THE VALUE OF ITS PROVED OIL AND GAS RESERVES. THE STANDARDIZED MEASURE IS

PREPARED ON THE BASIS OF CERTAIN PRESCRIBED ASSUMPTIONS INCLUDING FIRST-DAY-OF-THE-MONTH

AVERAGE PRICES, WHICH REPRESENT DISCRETE POINTS IN TIME AND THEREFORE MAY CAUSE

SIGNIFICANT VARIABILITY IN CASH FLOWS FROM YEAR TO YEAR AS PRICES CHANGE.

COMMISSION (SEC) RULES REQUIRE THE

CORPORATION’S RESERVES TO BE CALCULATED ON THE BASIS OF AVERAGE FIRST-OF-MONTH

OIL AND NATURAL GAS PRICES DURING THE REPORTING YEAR. AS A RESULT OF VERY LOW

PRICES DURING 2016, UNDER THE SEC DEFINITION OF PROVED RESERVES, CERTAIN

QUANTITIES OF OIL AND NATURAL GAS THAT QUALIFIED AS PROVED RESERVES IN PRIOR

YEARS DID NOT QUALIFY AS PROVED RESERVES AT YEAR-END 2016. FUTURE NET CASH

FLOWS FOR THESE QUANTITIES ARE EXCLUDED FROM THE 2016 STANDARDIZED MEASURE OF DISCOUNTED

FUTURE CASH FLOWS. SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THIS REDUCTION IN DISCOUNTED FUTURE NET
