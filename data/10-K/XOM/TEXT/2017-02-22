item1.  business
exxon mobil corporation was incorporated in the state of
new jersey in 1882. divisions and affiliated companies of exxonmobil operate or
market products in the united states and most other countries of the world.
their principal business is energy, involving exploration for, and production
of, crude oil and natural gas, manufacture of petroleum products and
transportation and sale of crude oil, natural gas and petroleum products.
exxonmobil is a major manufacturer and marketer of commodity petrochemicals, including
olefins, aromatics, polyethylene and polypropylene plastics and a wide variety of
specialty products. affiliates of exxonmobil conduct extensive research
programs in support of these businesses.
exxon mobil corporation has several divisions and hundreds
of affiliates, many with names that include exxonmobil, exxon, esso,
mobil or xto. for convenience and simplicity, in this report the
terms exxonmobil, exxon, esso, mobil and xto, as well as terms
like corporation, company, our, we and its,
are sometimes used as abbreviated references to specific affiliates or groups
of affiliates. the precise meaning depends on the context in question.
throughout exxonmobils businesses, new and ongoing
measures aretaken to prevent and minimize the impact of our operations on
air,water and ground. these include a significant investment in refining
infrastructure and technology to manufacture clean fuels, as well
asprojects to monitor and reduce nitrogen oxide, sulfur oxide and
greenhouse gas emissions, and expenditures for asset retirement obligations.
using definitions and guidelines established by the american petroleum
institute, exxonmobils 2016 worldwide environmental expenditures for all such
preventative and remediation steps, including exxonmobils share of equity
company expenditures, were $4.9billion, of which $3.5billion were
included in expenses with the remainder in capital expenditures. the total cost
for such activities is expected to remain relatively flat at approximately
$5billion in 2017 and 2018. capital expenditures are expected to account
for approximately 30percent of the total.
the energy and petrochemical industries are highly
competitive. there is competition within the industries and also with other
industries in supplying the energy, fuel and chemical needs of both industrial
and individual consumers. the corporation competes with other firms in the sale
or purchase of needed goods and services in many national and international
markets and employs all methods of competition which are lawful and appropriate
for such purposes.
operating data and industry segment information for the
corporation are contained in the financial section of this report under the
following: quarterly information, note18: disclosures about segments
and related information and operating information. information on oil and
gas reserves is contained in the oil and gas reserves part of the
supplemental information on oil and gas exploration and production activities
portion of the financial section of this report.
exxonmobil has a longstanding commitment to the
development of proprietary technology. we have a wide array of research
programs designed to meet the needs identified in each of our business segments.
information on companysponsored research and development spending is
contained in note3: miscellaneous financial information of the
financial section of this report. exxonmobil held nearly 12thousand
active patents worldwide at the end of 2016. for technology licensed to third
parties, revenues totaled approximately $104million in 2016. although
technology is an important contributor to the overall operations and results of
our company, the profitability of each business segment is not dependent on any
individual patent, trade secret, trademark, license, franchise or concession.
the number of regular employees was 71.1thousand,
73.5thousand, and 75.3thousand at years ended 2016, 2015 and 2014,
respectively. regular employees are defined as active executive, management,
professional, technical and wage employees who work full time or part time for
the corporation and are covered by the corporations benefit plans and
programs. regular employees do not include employees of the companyoperated
retail sites (cors). the number of cors employees was 1.6thousand,
2.1thousand, and 8.4thousand at years ended 2016, 2015 and 2014,
respectively. the decrease in cors employees reflects the multiyear
transition of the companyoperated retail network to a more capitalefficient
branded wholesaler model.
information concerning the source and availability of raw
materials used in the corporations business, the extent of seasonality in the
business, the possibility of renegotiation of profits or termination of
contracts at the election of governments and risks attendant to foreign operations
may be found in item 1a. risk factors and item 2. properties in this
report.
exxonmobil maintains a website at exxonmobil.com. our
annual report on form10-k, quarterly reports on form10-q, current
reports on form 8-k and any amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant
to section13(a) of the securities exchange act of 1934 are made available
through our website as soon as reasonably practical after we electronically
file or furnish the reports to the securities and exchange commission (sec).
also available on the corporations website are the companys corporate
governance guidelines and code of ethics and business conduct, as well as the
charters of the audit, compensation and nominating committees of the board of
directors. information on our website is not incorporated into this report.
item1a. risk factors
exxonmobils financial and operating
results are subject to a variety of risks inherent in the global oil, gas, and
petrochemical businesses. many of these risk factors are not within the
companys control and could adversely affect our business, our financial and
operating results, or our financial condition. these risk factors include:
supply and demand
the oil, gas, and petrochemical businesses are
fundamentally commodity businesses. this means exxonmobils operations and
earnings may be significantly affected by changes in oil, gas, and
petrochemical prices and by changes in margins on refined products. oil, gas,
petrochemical, and product prices and margins in turn depend on local, regional,
and global events or conditions that affect supply and demand for the relevant
commodity. any material decline in oil or natural gas prices could have a
material adverse effect on certain of the companys operations, especially in
the upstream segment, financial condition and proved reserves. on the other
hand, a material increase in oil or natural gas prices could have a material
adverse effect on certain of the companys operations, especially in the
downstream and chemical segments.
economic conditions. the demand for energy and petrochemicals correlates closely with
general economic growth rates. the occurrence of recessions or other periods of
low or negative economic growth will typically have a direct adverse impact on
our results. other factors that affect general economic conditions in the world
or in a major region, such as changes in population growth rates, periods of
civil unrest, government austerity programs, or currency exchange rate
fluctuations, can also impact the demand for energy and petrochemicals.
sovereign debt downgrades, defaults, inability to access debt markets due to
credit or legal constraints, liquidity crises, the breakup or restructuring of
fiscal, monetary, or political systems such as the european union, and other
events or conditions that impair the functioning of financial markets and
institutions also pose risks to exxonmobil, including risks to the safety of
our financial assets and to the ability of our partners and customers to
fulfill their commitments to exxonmobil.
other demand-related factors. other factors that may affect the demand for oil, gas,
and petrochemicals, and therefore impact our results, include technological
improvements in energy efficiency; seasonal weather patterns, which affect the
demand for energy associated with heating and cooling; increased competitiveness
of alternative energy sources that have so far generally not been competitive
with oil and gas without the benefit of government subsidies or mandates; and
changes in technology or consumer preferences that alter fuel choices, such as
toward alternative fueled or electric vehicles.
other supply-related factors. commodity prices and margins also vary depending on a
number of factors affecting supply. for example, increased supply from the
development of new oil and gas supply sources and technologies to enhance
recovery from existing sources tend to reduce commodity prices to the extent
such supply increases are not offset by commensurate growth in demand.
similarly, increases in industry refining or petrochemical manufacturing
capacity tend to reduce margins on the affected products. world oil, gas, and
petrochemical supply levels can also be affected by factors that reduce
available supplies, such as adherence by member countries to opec production
quotas and the occurrence of wars, hostile actions, natural disasters,
disruptions in competitors operations, or unexpected unavailability of
distribution channels that may disrupt supplies. technological change can also
alter the relative costs for competitors to find, produce, and refine oil and
gas and to manufacture petrochemicals.
other market factors. exxonmobils business results are also exposed to
potential negative impacts due to changes in interest rates, inflation,
currency exchange rates, and other local or regional market conditions. we
generally do not use financial instruments to hedge market exposures.
government and political factors
exxonmobils results can be adversely affected by
political or regulatory developments affecting our operations.
access limitations. a number of countries limit access to their oil and gas resources, or
may place resources off-limits from development altogether. restrictions on
foreign investment in the oil and gas sector tend to increase in times of high
commodity prices, when national governments may have less need of outside
sources of private capital. many countries also restrict the import or export
of certain products based on point of origin.
restrictions on doing business. exxonmobil is subject to laws and sanctions imposed
by the u.s. or by other jurisdictions where we do business that may prohibit
exxonmobil or certain of its affiliates from doing business in certain
countries, or restricting the kind of business that may be conducted. such
restrictions may provide a competitive advantage to competitors who may not be
subject to comparable restrictions.
lack of legal certainty. some countries in which we do business lack
well-developed legal systems, or have not yet adopted clear regulatory
frameworks for oil and gas development. lack of legal certainty exposes our
operations to increased risk of adverse or unpredictable actions by government
officials, and also makes it more difficult for us to enforce our contracts. in
some cases these risks can be partially offset by agreements to arbitrate
disputes in an international forum, but the adequacy of this remedy may still
depend on the local legal system to enforce an award.
regulatory and litigation risks.even in countries with well-developed legal
systems where exxonmobil does business, we remain exposed to changes in law
(including changes that result from international treaties and accords) that
could adversely affect our results, such as:
increases in taxes, duties, or government royalty
rates (including retroactive claims);
price controls;
changes in environmental regulations or other laws
that increase our cost of compliance or reduce or delay available business
opportunities (including changes in laws related to offshore drilling
operations, water use, methane emissions, or hydraulic fracturing);
adoption of regulations mandating the use of
alternative fuels or uncompetitive fuel components;
adoption of government payment transparency
regulations that could require us to disclose competitively sensitive
commercial information, or that could cause us to violate the non-disclosure
laws of other countries; and
government actions to cancel contracts,
re-denominate the official currency, renounce or default on obligations,
renegotiate terms unilaterally, or expropriate assets.
legal remedies available to compensate us for
expropriation or other takings may be inadequate.
we also may be adversely affected by the outcome of
litigation, especially in countries such as the united states in which very
large and unpredictable punitive damage awards may occur, or by government
enforcement proceedings alleging non-compliance with applicable laws or
regulations.
security concerns. successful operation of particular facilities or projects may be
disrupted by civil unrest, acts of sabotage or terrorism, and other local
security concerns. such concerns may require us to incur greater costs for
security or to shut down operations for a period of time.
climate change and greenhouse gas restrictions. due to concern over the risk of climate change, a
number of countries have adopted, or are considering the adoption of,
regulatory frameworks to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. these include
adoption of cap and trade regimes, carbon taxes, restrictive permitting,
increased efficiency standards, and incentives or mandates for renewable
energy. these requirements could make our products more expensive, lengthen
project implementation times, and reduce demand for hydrocarbons, as well as
shift hydrocarbon demand toward relatively lower-carbon sources such as natural
gas. current and pending greenhouse gas regulations may also increase our
compliance costs, such as for monitoring or sequestering emissions.
government sponsorship of alternative energy. many governments are providing tax advantages and other
subsidies to support alternative energy sources or are mandating the use of
specific fuels or technologies. governments and others are also promoting
research into new technologies to reduce the cost and increase the scalability
of alternative energy sources. we are conducting our own research both in-house
and by working with more than 80 leading universities around the world,
including the massachusetts institute of technology, princeton university, the
university of texas, and stanford university. our research projects focus on
developing algae-based biofuels, carbon capture and storage, breakthrough
energy efficiency processes, advanced energy-saving materials and other
technologies. for example, exxonmobil is working with fuel cell energy inc. to explore
using carbonate fuel cells to economically capture co2 emissions
from gas-fired power plants. our future results may depend in part on the
success of our research efforts and on our ability to adapt and apply the
strengths of our current business model to providing the energy products of the
future in a cost-competitive manner. see management effectiveness below.
management effectiveness
in addition to external economic and political
factors, our future business results also depend on our ability to manage
successfully those factors that are at least in part within our control. the
extent to which we manage these factors will impact our performance relative to
competition. for projects in which we are not the operator, we depend on the management
effectiveness of one or more co-venturers whom we do not control.
exploration and development program. our ability to maintain and grow our oil and gas
production depends on the success of our exploration and development efforts.
among other factors, we must continuously improve our ability to identify the
most promising resource prospects and apply our project management expertise to
bring discovered resources on line as scheduled and within budget.
project management. the success of exxonmobils upstream, downstream, and chemical businesses
depends on complex, longterm, capital intensive projects. these projects
in turn require a high degree of project management expertise to maximize
efficiency. specific factors that can affect the performance of major projects
include our ability to: negotiate successfully with joint venturers, partners,
governments, suppliers, customers, or others; model and optimize reservoir
performance; develop markets for project outputs, whether through long-term
contracts or the development of effective spot markets; manage changes in
operating conditions and costs, including costs of third party equipment or
services such as drilling rigs and shipping; prevent, to the extent possible,
and respond effectively to unforeseen technical difficulties that could delay
project startup or cause unscheduled project downtime; and influence the
performance of project operators where exxonmobil does not perform that role.
the term project as used in this report can refer to
a variety of different activities and does not necessarily have the same
meaning as in any government payment transparency reports.
operational efficiency. an important component of exxonmobils competitive
performance, especially given the commoditybased nature of many of our
businesses, is our ability to operate efficiently, including our ability to
manage expenses and improve production yields on an ongoing basis. this
requires continuous management focus, including technology improvements, cost
control, productivity enhancements, regular reappraisal of our asset portfolio,
and the recruitment, development, and retention of high caliber employees.
research and development. to maintain our competitive position, especially in
light of the technological nature of our businesses and the need for continuous
efficiency improvement, exxonmobils research and development organizations
must be successful and able to adapt to a changing market and policy
environment, including developing technologies to help reduce greenhouse gas
emissions.
safety, business controls, and environmental risk
management. our results depend on
managements ability to minimize the inherent risks of oil, gas, and
petrochemical operations, to control effectively our business activities, and
to minimize the potential for human error. we apply rigorous management systems
and continuous focus to workplace safety and to avoiding spills or other
adverse environmental events. for example, we work to minimize spills through a
combined program of effective operations integrity management, ongoing
upgrades, key equipment replacements, and comprehensive inspection and
surveillance. similarly, we are implementing cost-effective new technologies
and adopting new operating practices to reduce air emissions, not only in
response to government requirements but also to address community priorities.
we also maintain a disciplined framework of internal controls and apply a
controls management system for monitoring compliance with this framework.
substantial liabilities and other adverse impacts could result if our
management systems and controls do not function as intended. the ability to
insure against such risks is limited by the capacity of the applicable
insurance markets, which may not be sufficient.
business risks also include the risk of cybersecurity
breaches. if our systems for protecting against cybersecurity risks prove not
to be sufficient, exxonmobil could be adversely affected such as by having its
business systems compromised, its proprietary information altered, lost or
stolen, or its business operations disrupted.
preparedness.
our operations may be disrupted by severe weather events, natural disasters,
human error, and similar events. for example, hurricanes may damage our
offshore production facilities or coastal refining and petrochemical plants in
vulnerable areas. our facilities are designed, constructed, and operated to
withstand a variety of extreme climatic and other conditions, with safety
factors built in to cover a number of engineering uncertainties, including
those associated with wave, wind, and current intensity, marine ice flow
patterns, permafrost stability, storm surge magnitude, temperature extremes,
extreme rain fall events, and earthquakes. our consideration of changing
weather conditions and inclusion of safety factors in design covers the
engineering uncertainties that climate change and other events may potentially
introduce. our ability to mitigate the adverse impacts of these events depends
in part upon the effectiveness of our robust facility engineering as well as
our rigorous disaster preparedness and response and business continuity
planning.
projections, estimates, and descriptions of
exxonmobils plans and objectives included or incorporated in items 1, 1a, 2, 7
and 7a of this report are forward-looking statements. actual future results,
including project completion dates, production rates, capital expenditures, costs,
and business plans could differ materially due to, among other things, the
factors discussed above and elsewhere in this report.

1. disclosure of reserves
a. summary of oil and gas reserves at
year-end 2016
the table below summarizes the oil-equivalent proved
reserves in each geographic area and by product type for consolidated
subsidiaries and equity companies. gas is converted to an oil-equivalent basis
at six million cubic feet per one thousand barrels. the corporation has
reported proved reserves on the basis of the average of the
first-day-of-the-month price for each month during the last 12-month period. as
a result of very low prices during 2016, under the sec definition of proved reserves, certain quantities
of oil and natural gas that qualified as proved reserves in prior years did not
qualify as proved reserves at year-end 2016. among the factors that would
result in these amounts being recognized again as proved reserves at some point
in the future are a recovery in average price levels, a further decline in
costs, and / or operating efficiencies. otherwise, no major discovery or other favorable or adverse event
has occurred since december 31, 2016, that would cause a significant change in
the estimated proved reserves as of that date.

(1) south america includes proved
developed reserves of 29 billion cubic feet of natural gas.
in the preceding reserves information, consolidated subsidiary and
equity company reserves are reported separately. however, the corporation
operates its business with the same view of equity company reserves as it has
for reserves from consolidated subsidiaries.
the corporation anticipates several projects will come
online over the next few years providing additional production capacity.
however, actual volumes will vary from year to year due to the timing of
individual project start-ups; operational outages; reservoir performance;
performance of enhanced oil recovery projects; regulatory changes; the impact
of fiscal and commercial terms; asset sales; weather events; price effects on
production sharing contracts; changes in the amount and timing of capital
investments that may vary depending on the oil and gas price environment; and
other factors described in item 1a. risk factors.
the estimation of proved reserves, which is based on the
requirement of reasonable certainty, is an ongoing process based on rigorous
technical evaluations, commercial and market assessments and detailed analysis
of well and reservoir information such as flow rates and reservoir pressures.
furthermore, the corporation only records proved reserves for projects which
have received significant funding commitments by management made toward the
development of the reserves. although the corporation is reasonably certain
that proved reserves will be produced, the timing and amount recovered can be
affected by a number of factors including completion of development projects,
reservoir performance, regulatory approvals and significant changes in projections
of long-term oil and natural gas price levels. in addition, proved reserves
could be affected by an extended period of low prices which could reduce the
level of the corporations capital spending and also impact our partners
capacity to fund their share of joint projects.
as noted above, certain quantities of oil and natural gas
that qualified as proved reserves in prior years did not qualify as proved
reserves at year-end 2016. amounts no longer qualifying as proved reserves
include the entire 3.5 billion barrels of bitumen at kearl. in addition, 0.8
billion barrels of oil equivalent across the remainder of north america no
longer qualify as proved reserves mainly due to the acceleration of the
projected end-of-field-life. among the factors that would result in these
amounts being recognized again as proved reserves at some point in the future
are a recovery in average price levels, a further decline in costs, and / or
operating efficiencies. under the terms of certain contractual arrangements or
government royalty regimes, lower prices can also increase proved reserves
attributable to exxonmobil. we do not expect the downward revision of reported
proved reserves under sec definitions to affect the operation of the underlying
projects or to alter our outlook for future production volumes.
b. technologies used in
establishing proved reserves additions in 2016
additions to exxonmobils proved reserves in 2016 were
based on estimates generated through the integration of available and
appropriate geological, engineering and production data, utilizing
well-established technologies that have been demonstrated in the field to yield
repeatable and consistent results.
data used in these integrated assessments included
information obtained directly from the subsurface via wellbores, such as well
logs, reservoir core samples, fluid samples, static and dynamic pressure
information, production test data, and surveillance and performance
information. the data utilized also included subsurface information obtained
through indirect measurements including high-quality 3-d and 4-d seismic data,
calibrated with available well control information. the tools used to interpret
the data included proprietary seismic processing software, proprietary
reservoir modeling and simulation software, and commercially available data
analysis packages.
in some circumstances, where appropriate analog reservoirs
were available, reservoir parameters from these analogs were used to increase
the quality of and confidence in the reserves estimates.
c. qualifications of
reserves technical oversight group and internal controls over proved reserves
exxonmobil has a dedicated global reserves group that
provides technical oversight and is separate from the operating organization.
primary responsibilities of this group include oversight of the reserves
estimation process for compliance with securities and exchange commission (sec)
rules and regulations, review of annual changes in reserves estimates, and the
reporting of exxonmobils proved reserves. this group also maintains the
official company reserves estimates for exxonmobils proved reserves of crude
and natural gas liquids, bitumen, synthetic oil and natural gas. in addition,
the group provides training to personnel involved in the reserves estimation
and reporting process within exxonmobil and its affiliates. the manager of the
global reserves group has more than 25 years of experience in reservoir
engineering and reserves assessment and has a degree in engineering. he is an
active member of the society of petroleum engineers (spe). the group is staffed
with individuals that have an average of more than 20 years of technical experience
in the petroleum industry, including expertise in the classification and
categorization of reserves under the sec guidelines. this group includes
individuals who hold advanced degrees in either engineering or geology. several
members of the group hold professional registrations in their field of
expertise, and a member currently serves on the spe oil and gas reserves
committee.
the global reserves group maintains a
central database containing the official company reserves estimates.
appropriate controls, including limitations on database access and update
capabilities, are in place to ensure data integrity within this central
database. an annual review of the systems controls is performed by internal
audit. key components of the reserves estimation process include technical
evaluations and analysis of well and field performance and a rigorous peer
review. no changes may be made to the reserves estimates in the central
database, including additions of any new initial reserves estimates or
subsequent revisions, unless these changes have been thoroughly reviewed and
evaluated by duly authorized personnel within the operating organization. in
addition, changes to reserves estimates that exceed certain thresholds require
further review and approval of the appropriate level of management within the
operating organization before the changes may be made in the central database.
endorsement by the global reserves group for all proved reserves changes is a
mandatory component of this review process. after all changes are made, reviews
are held with senior management for final endorsement.

proved undeveloped reserves
at year-end 2016, approximately 6.2 billion oil-equivalent
barrels (goeb) of exxonmobils proved reserves were classified as proved
undeveloped. this represents 31 percent of the 20 goeb reported in proved
reserves. this compares to the 6.8 goeb of proved undeveloped reserves reported
at the end of 2015. during the year, exxonmobil conducted development
activities in over 100 fields that resulted in the transfer of approximately 1
goeb from proved undeveloped to proved developed reserves by yearend.
the largest transfers were related to the gorgon lng project start-up and
drilling activity at upper zakum, tengiz and in the united states. during 2016,
extensions, primarily in the united states, resulted in an addition of
approximately 0.4 goeb of proved undeveloped reserves.
overall, investments of $10.1 billion were made by the
corporation during 2016 to progress the development of reported proved
undeveloped reserves, including $9.3 billion for oil and gas producing
activities and an additional $0.8 billion for other non-oil and gas producing
activities such as the construction of support infrastructure and other related
facilities. these investments represented 70 percent of the $14.5 billion in
total reported upstream capital and exploration expenditures. investments made
by the corporation to develop quantities which no longer meet the sec definition
of proved reserves due to 2016 average prices are included in the $14.5 billion
of upstream capital expenditures reported above but are excluded from amounts
related to progressing the development of proved undeveloped reserves.
one of exxonmobils requirements for reporting proved
reserves is that management has made significant funding commitments toward the
development of the reserves. exxonmobil has a disciplined investment strategy
and many major fields require long leadtime in order to be developed.
development projects typically take several years from the time of recording
proved undeveloped reserves to the start of production. however, the
development time for large and complex projects can exceed five years. proved
undeveloped reserves in australia, the united states, kazakhstan, the
netherlands, qatar, and nigeria have remained undeveloped for five years or
more primarily due to constraints on the capacity of infrastructure, the pace
of coventurer/government funding, as well as the time required to
complete development for very large projects. the corporation is reasonably
certain that these proved reserves will be produced; however, the timing and
amount recovered can be affected by a number of factors including completion of
development projects, reservoir performance, regulatory approvals, and
significant changes in long-term oil and natural gas price levels. of the
proved undeveloped reserves that have been reported for five or more years,
over 80 percent are contained in the aforementioned countries. the largest of
these is related to lng/gas projects in australia, where construction of the
gorgon lng project is in the final phases. in kazakhstan, the proved
undeveloped reserves are related to the remainder of the initial development of
the offshore kashagan field which is included in the north caspian production
sharing agreement and the tengizchevroil joint venture which includes a
production license in the tengiz  korolev field complex. the tengizchevroil
joint venture is producing, and proved undeveloped reserves will continue to
move to proved developed as approved development phases progress. in the
netherlands, the groningen gas field has proved undeveloped reserves related to
installation of future stages of compression. these reserves will move to
proved developed when the additional stages of compression are installed to
maintain field delivery pressure.

average production prices have been calculated by using
sales quantities from the corporations own production as the divisor. average
production costs have been computed by using net production quantities for the
divisor. the volumes of crude oil and natural gas liquids (ngl) production used
for this computation are shown in the oil and gas production table in section
3.a. the volumes of natural gas used in the calculation are the production
volumes of natural gas available for sale and are also shown in section 3.a.
the natural gas available for sale volumes are different from those shown in
the reserves table in the oil and gas reserves part of the supplemental
information on oil and gas exploration and production activities portion of
the financial section of this report due to volumes consumed or flared. gas is
converted to an oil-equivalent basis at six million cubic feet per one thousand
barrels.

b. exploratory and development activities regarding oil and gas
resources extracted by mining technologies
syncrude operations. syncrude is a joint venture established to
recover shallow deposits of oil sands using open-pit mining methods to extract
the crude bitumen, and then upgrade it to produce a high-quality, light (32
degrees api), sweet, synthetic crude oil. imperial oil limited is the owner of
a 25 percent interest in the joint venture. exxon mobil corporation has a
69.6percent interest in imperial oil limited. in 2016, the companys
share of net production of synthetic crude oil was about 67thousand
barrels per day and share of net acreage was about 63thousand acres in
the athabasca oil sands deposit.
kearl operations. kearl is a joint venture established to
recover shallow deposits of oil sands using open-pit mining methods to extract
the crude bitumen. imperial oil limited holds a 70.96 percent interest in the
joint venture and exxonmobil canada properties holds the other 29.04 percent.
exxon mobil corporation has a 69.6 percent interest in imperial oil limited and
a 100percent interest in exxonmobil canada properties. kearl is comprised
of six oil sands leases covering about 49 thousand acres in the athabasca oil
sands deposit.
kearl is located approximately 40 miles north of fort
mcmurray, alberta, canada. bitumen is extracted from oil sands produced from
open-pit mining operations, and processed through bitumen extraction and froth
treatment trains. the product, a blend of bitumen and diluent, is shipped to our
refineries and to other third parties. diluent is natural gas condensate or
other light hydrocarbons added to the crude bitumen to facilitate
transportation by pipeline and rail. during 2016, average net production at kearl
was about 167 thousand barrels per day.
as a result of very low prices during 2016, under the sec
definition of proved reserves, the entire 3.5 billion barrels of bitumen at
kearl did not qualify as proved reserves at year-end 2016. among the factors that would result in
these amounts being recognized again as proved reserves at some point in the
future are a recovery in average price levels, a further decline in costs, and
/ or operating efficiencies.

the first two trains and the domestic gas plant of the
co-venturer-operated gorgon jansz liquefied natural gas (lng) project started
up in 2016, and construction activities continued on the third train. the
project consists of a subsea infrastructure for offshore production and
transportation of the gas, a 15.6 million tonnes per year lng facility and a
280 million cubic feet per day domestic gas plant located on barrow island,
western australia.
papua new guinea
a total of 5.0 million net acres were held by exxonmobil at year-end
2016, of which 4.1 million net acres were offshore. the papua new guinea (png)
lng integrated development includes gas production and processing facilities in
the southern png highlands, onshore and offshore pipelines, and a 6.9 million
tonnes per year lng facility near port moresby. exxonmobil acquired deepwater acreage offshore papua new
guinea during 2016.
worldwide exploration
at year-end 2016, exploration activities were under way in
several areas in which exxonmobil has no established production operations and
thus are not included above. a total of 10.0 million net acres were held at
year-end 2016 and 3.1 net exploration wells were
completed during the year in these countries.
6. delivery commitments
exxonmobil sells crude oil and natural gas
from its producing operations under a variety of contractual obligations, some
of which may specify the delivery of a fixed and determinable quantity for
periods longer than one year. exxonmobil also enters into natural gas sales
contracts where the source of the natural gas used to fulfill the contract can
be a combination of our own production and the spot market. worldwide, we are
contractually committed to deliver approximately 94 million barrels of oil and
2,500 billion cubic feet of natural gas for the period from 2017 through 2019.
we expect to fulfill the majority of these delivery commitments with production
from our proved developed reserves. any remaining commitments will be fulfilled
with production from our proved undeveloped reserves and spot market purchases
as necessary.

gross and 4,970 net thousands of acres for 2015.
exxonmobils investment in developed and undeveloped
acreage is comprised of numerous concessions, blocks and leases. the terms and
conditions under which the corporation maintains exploration and/or production
rights to the acreage are propertyspecific, contractually defined and
vary significantly from property to property. work programs are designed to
ensure that the exploration potential of any property is fully evaluated before
expiration. in some instances, the corporation may elect to relinquish acreage
in advance of the contractual expiration date if the evaluation process is
complete and there is not a business basis for extension. in cases where
additional time may be required to fully evaluate acreage, the corporation has
generally been successful in obtaining extensions. the scheduled expiration of
leases and concessions for undeveloped acreage over the next three years is not
expected to have a material adverse impact on the corporation.
d. summary of acreage terms
united states
oil and gas exploration and production rights are acquired
from mineral interest owners through a lease. mineral interest owners include
the federal and state governments, as well as private mineral interest owners.
leases typically have an exploration period ranging from one to ten years, and
a production period that normally remains in effect until production ceases.
under certain circumstances, a lease may be held beyond its exploration term
even if production has not commenced. in some instances regarding private
property, a fee interest is acquired where the underlying mineral interests
are owned outright.
canada/south
america
canada
exploration licenses or leases in onshore areas are acquired
for varying periods of time with renewals or extensions possible. these
licenses or leases entitle the holder to continue existing licenses or leases
upon completing specified work. in general, these license and lease agreements
are held as long as there is proven production capability on the licenses and
leases. exploration licenses in offshore eastern canada and the beaufort sea
are held by work commitments of various amounts and rentals. they are valid for
a maximum term of nine years. production licenses in the offshore are valid for
25 years, with rights of extension for continued production. significant
discovery licenses in the offshore, relating to currently undeveloped
discoveries, do not have a definite term.
argentina
the federal hydrocarbon law was amended in december 2014.
the onshore concession terms granted prior to the amendment are up to six
years, divided into three potential exploration periods, with an optional
extension for up to one year depending on the classification of the area.
pursuant to the amended law, the production term for a conventional production
concession would be 25years, and 35 years for an unconventional
concession, with unlimited ten-year extensions possible, once a field has been
developed.
europe
germany
exploration concessions are granted for an initial maximum
period of five years, with an unlimited number of extensions of up to three
years each. extensions are subject to specific, minimum work commitments.
production licenses are normally granted for 20to25 years with
multiple possible extensions as long as there is production on the license.
netherlands
under the mining law, effective january 1, 2003,
exploration and production licenses for both onshore and offshore areas are
issued for a period as explicitly defined in the license. the term is based on
the period of time necessary to perform the activities for which the license is
issued. license conditions are stipulated in the license and are based on the
mining law.
production rights granted prior to january 1, 2003, remain
subject to their existing terms, and differ slightly for onshore and offshore
areas. onshore production licenses issued prior to 1988 were indefinite; from
1988 they were issued for a period as explicitly defined in the license,
ranging from 35 to 45 years. offshore production licenses issued before 1976
were issued for a fixed period of 40 years; from 1976 they were again issued
for a period as explicitly defined in the license, ranging from 15 to
40years.
norway
licenses issued prior to 1972 were for an initial period of
six years and an extension period of 40 years, with relinquishment of at least
one-fourth of the original area required at the end of the sixth year and
another one-fourth at the end of the ninth year. licenses issued between 1972
and 1997 were for an initial period of up to six years (with extension of the
initial period of one year at a time up to ten years after 1985), and an
extension period of up to 30 years, with relinquishment of at least one-half of
the original area required at the end of the initial period. licenses issued
after july 1, 1997, have an initial period of up to ten years and a normal
extension period of up to 30 years or in special cases of up to 50 years, and with
relinquishment of at least one-half of the original area required at the end of
the initial period.
united
kingdom
acreage terms are fixed by the government and are
periodically changed. for example, many of the early licenses issued under the
first four licensing rounds provided for an initial term of six years with
relinquishment of at least one-half of the original area at the end of the
initial term, subject to extension for a further 40 years. at the end of any
such 40-year term, licenses may continue in producing areas until cessation of
production; or licenses may continue in development areas for periods agreed on
a case-by-case basis until they become producing areas; or licenses terminate
in all other areas. the licensing regime was last updated in 2002, and the
majority of licenses issued have an initial term of four years with a second
term extension of four years and a final term of 18 years with a mandatory
relinquishment of 50 percent of the acreage after the initial term and of all
acreage that is not covered by a development plan at the end of the second
term.
africa
angola
exploration and production activities are governed by
production sharing agreements with an initial exploration term of four years
and an optional second phase of two to three years. the production period is
for 25 years, and agreements generally provide for a negotiated extension.
chad
exploration permits are issued for a period of five years,
and are renewable for one or two further five-year periods. the terms and
conditions of the permits, including relinquishment obligations, are specified
in a negotiated convention. the production term is for 30 years and may be
extended up to 50 years at the discretion of the government.
equatorial guinea
exploration, development and production activities are
governed by production sharing contracts (pscs) negotiated with the state
ministry of mines and hydrocarbons. a new psc was signed in 2015; the initial
exploration period is five years for oil and gas, with multi-year extensions
available at the discretion of the ministry and limited relinquishments in the
absence of commercial discoveries. the production period for crude oil ranges
from 25 to 30 years, while the production period for natural gas ranges from 25
to 50 years.
nigeria
exploration and production activities in the deepwater
offshore areas are typically governed by production sharing contracts (pscs)
with the national oil company, the nigerian national petroleum corporation
(nnpc). nnpc typically holds the underlying oil prospecting license (opl) and
any resulting oil mining lease (oml). the terms of the pscs are generally 30
years, including a ten-year exploration period (an initial exploration phase
that can be divided into multiple optional periods) covered by an opl. upon
commercial discovery, an opl may be converted to an oml. partial relinquishment
is required under the psc at the end of the ten-year exploration period, and
omls have a 20-year production period that may be extended.
some exploration activities are carried out in deepwater by
joint ventures with local companies holding interests in an opl. opls in
deepwater offshore areas are valid for ten years, while in all other areas the
licenses are for five years. demonstrating a commercial discovery is the basis
for conversion of an opl to an oml.
omls granted prior to the 1969 petroleum act (i.e., under
the mineral oils act 1914, repealed by the 1969 petroleum act) were for 30
years onshore and 40 years in offshore areas and have been renewed, effective
december 1, 2008, for a further period of 20years, with a further renewal
option of 20 years. operations under these pre-1969 omls are conducted under a
joint venture agreement with nnpc rather than a psc. commercial terms
applicable to the existing joint venture oil production are defined by the
petroleum profits tax act.
omls granted under the 1969 petroleum act, which include
all deepwater omls, have a maximum term of 20 years without distinction for
onshore or offshore location and are renewable, upon 12 months written notice,
for another period of 20 years. omls not held by nnpc are also subject to a
mandatory 50-percent relinquishment after the first ten years of their duration.
asia
azerbaijan
the production sharing agreement (psa) for the development
of the azeri-chirag-gunashli field is established for an initial period of 30
years starting from the psa execution date in 1994.
other exploration and production activities are governed by
psas negotiated with the national oil company of azerbaijan. the exploration
period consists of three or four years with the possibility of a one to
three-year extension. the production period, which includes development, is for
25 years or 35 years with the possibility of one or two five-year extensions.
indonesia
exploration and production activities in indonesia are
generally governed by cooperation contracts, usually in the form of a production
sharing contract (psc), negotiated with bpmigas, a government agency
established in 2002 to manage upstream oil and gas activities. in 2012,
indonesias constitutional court ruled certain articles of law relating to
bpmigas to be unconstitutional, but stated that all existing pscs signed with
bpmigas should remain in force until their expiry, and the functions and duties
previously performed by bpmigas are to be carried out by the relevant ministry
of the government of indonesia until the promulgation of a new oil and gas law.
by presidential decree, skkmigas became the interim successor to bpmigas. the
current pscs have an exploration period of six years, which can be extended up
to 10 years, and an exploitation period of 20 years. pscs generally require the
contractor to relinquish 10 percent to 20 percent of the contract area after
three years and generally allow the contractor to retain no more than 50
percent to 80 percent of the original contract area after six years, depending
on the acreage and terms.
iraq
development and production activities in the state-owned
oil and gas fields are governed by contracts with regional oil companies of the
iraqi ministry of oil. an exxonmobil affiliate entered into a contract with
south oil company of the iraqi ministry of oil for the rights to participate in
the development and production activities of the west qurna phasei oil
and gas field effective march 1, 2010. the term of the contract is 20 years
with the right to extend for five years. the contract provides for cost
recovery plus per-barrel fees for incremental production above specified levels.
exploration and production activities in the kurdistan
region of iraq are governed by production sharing contracts (pscs) negotiated
with the regional government of kurdistan in 2011. the exploration term is for
five years, with extensions available as provided by the pscs and at the
discretion of the regional government of kurdistan. current pscs remain in
effect by agreement of the regional government to allow additional time for
exploration or evaluation of commerciality. the production period is 20years
with the right to extend for five years.
kazakhstan
onshore exploration and production activities are governed
by the production license, exploration license and joint venture agreements
negotiated with the republic of kazakhstan. existing production operations have
a 40-year production period that commenced in 1993.
offshore exploration and production activities are governed
by a production sharing agreement negotiated with the republic of kazakhstan.
the exploration period is six years followed by separate appraisal periods for
each discovery. the production period for each discovery, which includes
development, is for 20 years from the date of declaration of commerciality with
the possibility of two ten-year extensions.
malaysia
production activities are governed by production sharing
contracts (pscs) negotiated with the national oil company. the pscs have terms
ranging up to 29 years. all extensions are subject to the national oil
companys prior written approval. the total production period is 15 to 29
years, depending on the provisions of the respective contract.
qatar
the state of qatar grants gas production development
project rights to develop and supply gas from the offshore north field to
permit the economic development and production of gas reserves sufficient to
satisfy the gas and lng sales obligations of these projects.
republic of yemen
the jannah production sharing agreement has a development
period extending 20 years from first commercial declaration, which was made in
june 1995. due to force majeure events, the development period has been
extended beyond its original expiration date by an additional 735 days, with
the possibility of further extensions due to ongoing force majeure events.
russia
terms for exxonmobils sakhalin acreage are fixed by the
production sharing agreement (psa) that became effective in 1996 between the
russian government and the sakhalin-1 consortium, of which exxonmobil is the
operator. the term of the psa is 20years from the declaration of
commerciality, which would be 2021. the term may be extended thereafter in
ten-year increments as specified in the psa.
exploration and production activities in the kara, laptev,
chukchi and black seas are governed by joint venture agreements concluded with
rosneft in 2013 and 2014 that cover certain of rosnefts offshore licenses. the
kara sea licenses covered by the joint venture agreements concluded in 2013
extend through 2040 and include an exploration period through 2020. additional
licenses in the kara, laptev and chukchi seas covered by the joint venture
agreements concluded in 2014 extend through 2043 and include an exploration
period through 2023. the kara, laptev and chukchi sea licenses require
development plan submission within eight years of a discovery and development
activities within five years of plan approval. the black sea exploration
license extends through 2017 and a discovery is the basis for obtaining a
license for production. refer to the relevant portion of
note7:equity company information of the financial section of this
report for additional information on the corporations participation in rosneft
joint venture activities.
thailand
the petroleum act of 1971 allows production under
exxonmobils concession for 30 years with a ten-year extension at terms
generally prevalent at the time.
united arab emirates
an interest in the development and production activities of
the upper zakum field, a major offshore field, was acquired effective as of
january 2006, for a term expiring march 2026, and in 2013 the governing
agreements were extended to 2041.
australia / oceania
australia

commonwealth waters are governed by federal legislation. exploration permits
are granted for an initial term of six years with two possible five-year
renewal periods. retention leases may be granted for resources that are not
commercially viable at the time of application, but are expected to become
commercially viable within 15years. these are granted for periods of five
years and renewals may be requested. prior to july 1998, production licenses
were granted initially for 21 years, with a further renewal of 21 years and
thereafter indefinitely, i.e., for the life of the field. effective from july
1998, new production licenses are granted indefinitely. in each case, a
production license may be terminated if no production operations have been
carried on for five years.
papua new guinea
exploration and production activities are governed by the

proceedings
on
december 8, 2016, the texas commission on environmental quality (tceq)
contacted the corporation concerning alleged violations of the texas clean air
act, certain implementing regulations, and the applicable new source review
permit in connection with exceedances of the nitrogen oxide emission limit at a
compressor engine and volatile organic compound emission limits at tanks 21 and
23 at the corporations former king ranch gas plant. the tceq is seeking a
civil penalty in excess of $100,000, and the corporation is working with the
tceq to resolve the matter.

as previously reported in the corporations quarterly
report on form 10-q for the quarter ended september 30, 2016, on july21,2016,
the corporation entered into an arrangement agreement, as amended and restated
on december 15, 2016, to acquire all of the issued and outstanding common stock
of interoil corporation (ioc) in exchange for consideration including around 28
million shares of exxon mobil corporation common stock. with respect to the
shares of common stock to be issued in connection with the transaction, the
corporation is relying on the exemption from registration provided by section
3(a)(10) of the securities act of 1933.
as previously reported in the corporations current report
on form 8-k filed january 17, 2017, on january 16, 2017, an affiliate of the
corporation entered into a purchase and sale agreement (psa) to acquire
companies owned by the bass family of fort worth, texas, that indirectly own
certain oil and gas properties in the permian basin and certain additional
properties and related assets in exchange for issuance to the sellers of shares
of exxon mobil corporation common stock having an aggregate value at the time
of closing of $5.6 billion. the number of shares of the corporations common
stock for this purpose will be determined based on the corporations
volume-weighted average trading price over a 10-day period ending on the third
trading date immediately preceding the closing date. the transaction is
currently expected to close on or about february 28, 2017. as of january 16,
2017, the number of shares issuable in connection with the transaction would
have been approximately 63 million. the sale of shares under the psa has been
structured as a private placement solely to accredited investors and therefore
the corporation is relying on the exemption from registration provided by
section 4(a)(2) of the securities act of 1933.

frequently used terms
listed below are definitions of several of
exxonmobils key business and financial performance measures. these definitions
are provided to facilitate understanding of the terms and their calculation.
cash flow from operations and asset sales
cash
flow from operations and asset sales is the sum of the net cash provided by
operating activities and proceeds associated with sales of subsidiaries,
property, plant and equipment, and sales and returns of investments from the
consolidated statement of cash flows. this cash flow reflects the total sources
of cash from both operating the corporations assets and from the divesting of
assets. the corporation employs a long-standing and regular disciplined review
process to ensure that all assets are contributing to the corporations
strategic objectives. assets are divested when they are no longer meeting these
objectives or are worth considerably more to others. because of the regular
nature of this activity, we believe it is useful for investors to consider
proceeds associated with asset sales together with cash provided by operating
activities when evaluating cash available for investment in the business and
financing activities, including shareholder distributions.

how the capital is used by the businesses, it includes exxonmobils net share
of property, plant and equipment and other assets less liabilities, excluding
both short-term and long-term debt. when viewed from the perspective of the
sources of capital employed in total for the corporation, it includes
exxonmobils share of total debt and equity. both of these views include
exxonmobils share of amounts applicable to equity companies, which the
corporation believes should be included to provide a more comprehensive measure
of capital employed.

return on
average capital employed
return
on average capital employed (roce) is a performance measure ratio. from the
perspective of the business segments, roce is annual business segment earnings
divided by average business segment capital employed (average of beginning and
end-of-year amounts). these segment earnings include exxonmobils share of
segment earnings of equity companies, consistent with our capital employed
definition, and exclude the cost of financing. the corporations total roce is
net income attributable to exxonmobil excluding the after-tax cost of
financing, divided by total corporate average capital employed. the corporation
has consistently applied its roce definition for many years and views it as the
best measure of historical capital productivity in our capital-intensive,
long-term industry, both to evaluate managements performance and to
demonstrate to shareholders that capital has been used wisely over the long
term. additional measures, which are more cash flow based, are used to make
investment decisions.

managements discussion and analysis of
financial condition and results of operations
overview
the
following discussion and analysis of exxonmobils financial results, as well as
the accompanying financial statements and related notes to consolidated
financial statements to which they refer, are the responsibility of the
management of exxon mobil corporation. the corporations accounting and
financial reporting fairly reflect its straightforward business model involving
the extracting, manufacturing and marketing of hydrocarbons and
hydrocarbon-based products. the corporations business model involves the
production (or purchase), manufacture and sale of physical products, and all
commercial activities are directly in support of the underlying physical
movement ofgoods.
exxonmobil,
with its resource base, financial strength, disciplined investment approach and
technology portfolio, is wellpositioned to participate in substantial
investments to develop new energy supplies. the companys integrated business
model, with significant investments in upstream, downstream and chemical
segments, reduces the corporations risk from changes in commodity prices. while
commodity prices are volatile on a short-term basis and depend on supply and
demand, exxonmobils investment decisions are based on our long-term business
outlook, using a disciplined approach in selecting and pursuing the most
attractive investment opportunities. the corporate plan is a fundamental annual
management process that is the basis for setting near-term operating and
capital objectives in addition to providing the longer-term economic
assumptions used for investment evaluation purposes. volumes are based on
individual field production profiles, which are also updated annually. price
ranges for crude oil, natural gas, refined products, and chemical products are
based on corporate plan assumptions developed annually by major region and are
utilized for investment evaluation purposes. major investment opportunities are
evaluated over a range of economic scenarios. once major investments are made,
a reappraisal process is completed to ensure relevant lessons are learned and
improvements are incorporated into future projects.
business environment and risk assessment
long-term business outlook
by
2040, the worlds population is projected to grow to approximately
9billion people, or about 1.8billion more than in 2015. coincident
with this population increase, the corporation expects worldwide economic
growth to average close to 3percent per year. as economies and
populations grow, and as living standards improve for billions of people, the
need for energy will continue to rise. even with significant efficiency gains,
global energy demand is projected to rise by about 25percent from 2015 to
2040. this demand increase is expected to be concentrated in developing
countries (i.e., those that are not member nations of the organisation for
economic cooperation and development).
as
expanding prosperity drives global energy demand higher, increasing use of
energyefficient technologies and practices as well as lower-emission
fuels will continue to help significantly reduce energy consumption and
emissions per unit of economic output over time. substantial efficiency gains
are likely in all key aspects of the worlds economy through 2040, affecting
energy requirements for transportation, power generation, industrial
applications, and residential and commercial needs.
energy
for transportation  including cars, trucks, ships, trains and airplanes  is
expected to increase by about 25percent from 2015 to 2040. the growth in
transportation energy demand is likely to account for approximately 60percent
of the growth in liquid fuels demand worldwide over this period. nearly all the
worlds transportation fleets will continue to run on liquid fuels, which are abundant,
widely available, easy to transport, and provide a large quantity of energy in
small volumes.
demand
for electricity around the world is likely to increase approximately
60percent from 2015 to 2040, led by a doubling of demand in developing
countries. consistent with this projection, power generation is expected to
remain the largest and fastestgrowing major segment of global energy
demand. meeting the expected growth in power demand will require a diverse set
of energy sources. the share of coalfired generation is likely to
decline to less than 30 percent of the worlds electricity in 2040, versus
about 40 percent in 2015, in part as a result of policies to improve air
quality as well as reduce greenhouse gas emissions to address the risks of
climate change. from 2015 to 2040, the amount of electricity generated using
natural gas, nuclear power, and renewables is likely to approximately double,
and account for 90 percent of the growth in electricity supplies. by 2040,
coal, natural gas and renewables are projected to each be generating in the
range of 25-30 percent of electricity worldwide, although significant
differences will exist across regions reflecting a wide range of factors
including the cost and availability of energy types.
liquid
fuels provide the largest share of global energy supplies today reflecting
broad-based availability, affordability, ease of distribution, and fitness as a
practical solution to meet a wide variety of needs. by 2040, global demand for
liquid fuels is projected to grow to approximately 112million barrels of
oilequivalent per day, an increase of about 20percent from 2015.
much of this demand today is met by crude production from traditional
conventional sources; these supplies will remain important as significant
development activity is expected to offset much of the natural declines from
these fields. at the same time, a variety of emerging supply sources  including
tight oil, deepwater, oil sands, natural gas liquids and biofuels  are
expected to grow significantly to meet rising demand. the worlds resource base
is sufficient to meet projected demand through
managements discussion and analysis of
financial condition and results of operations
2040 as
technology advances continue to expand the availability of economic supply
options. however, access to resources and timely investments will remain
critical to meeting global needs with reliable, affordable supplies.
natural
gas is a versatile fuel, suitable for a wide variety of applications, and it is
expected to be the fastest-growing major fuel source from 2015 to 2040, meeting
about 40percent of global energy demand growth. global natural gas demand
is expected to rise about 45percent from 2015 to 2040, with about
45percent of that increase in the asia pacific region. helping meet these
needs will be significant growth in supplies of unconventional gas  the
natural gas found in shale and other rock formations that was once considered
uneconomic to produce. in total, about 60percent of the growth in natural
gas supplies is expected to be from unconventional sources. at the same time,
conventionally-produced natural gas is likely to remain the cornerstone of
supply, meeting about twothirds of global demand in 2040. worldwide
liquefied natural gas (lng) trade will expand significantly, likely reaching
more than 2.5 times the level of 2015 by 2040, with much of this supply
expected to meet rising demand in asia pacific.
the
worlds energy mix is highly diverse and will remain so through 2040. oil is
expected to remain the largest source of energy with its share remaining close
to onethird in 2040. coal is currently the second largest source of
energy, but it is likely to lose that position to natural gas in the 20252030
timeframe. the share of natural gas is expected to reach 25percent by
2040, while the share of coal falls to about 20percent. nuclear power is
projected to grow significantly, as many nations are likely to expand nuclear
capacity to address rising electricity needs as well as energy security and
environmental issues. total renewable energy is likely to reach about
15percent of total energy by 2040, with biomass, hydro and geothermal
contributing a combined share of more than 10percent. total energy
supplied from wind, solar and biofuels is expected to increase rapidly, growing
over 200percent from 2015 to 2040, when they will be about 4percent
of world energy.
the
corporation anticipates that the worlds available oil and gas resource base
will grow not only from new discoveries, but also from reserve increases in
previously discovered fields. technology will underpin these increases. the
cost to develop and supply these resources will be significant. according to
the international energy agency, the investment required to meet oil and
natural gas supply requirements worldwide over the period 20162040 will
be about $23trillion (measured in 2015 dollars) or approximately
$900billion per year on average.
international
accords and underlying regional and national regulations covering greenhouse
gas emissions continue to evolve with uncertain timing and outcome, making it
difficult to predict their business impact. for many years, the corporation has
taken into account policies established to reduce energyrelated
greenhouse gas emissions in its long-term outlook for energy, which is
used as a foundation for assessing the business environment and business
strategies and investments. the climate accord reached at the recent conference
of the parties (cop21) in paris set many new goals, and many related
policies are still emerging. our outlook reflects increasingly stringent
climate policies and is consistent with the aggregation of nationally
determined contributions which were submitted by signatories to the united
nations framework convention on climate change (unfcc) 2015 paris agreement.
our outlook seeks to identify potential impacts of climate related
policies, which often target specific sectors, by using various assumptions and
tools including application of a proxy cost of carbon to estimate potential
impacts on consumer demands. for purposes of the outlook, a proxy cost
on energy-related co2 emissions is assumed to reach about $80 per
tonne on average in 2040 in oecd nations. china and other leading non-oecd
nations are expected to trail oecd policy initiatives. nevertheless, as people
and nations look for ways to reduce risks of global climate change, they will
continue to need practical solutions that do not jeopardize the affordability
or reliability of the energy they need. thus, all practical and economically
viable energy sources, both conventional and unconventional, will need to be
pursued to continue meeting global energy demand, recognizing the scale and
variety of worldwide energy needs as well as the importance of expanding access
to modern energy to promote better standards of living for billions of people.
the
information provided in the longterm business outlook includes
exxonmobils internal estimates and forecasts based upon internal data and
analyses as well as publicly available information from external sources
including the international energy agency.
upstream
exxonmobil
continues to maintain a diverse portfolio of exploration and development
opportunities, which enables the corporation to be selective, maximizing
shareholder value and mitigating political and technical risks. exxonmobils
fundamental upstream business strategies guide our global exploration,
development, production, and gas and power marketing activities. these
strategies include capturing material and accretive opportunities to
continually high-grade the resource portfolio, selectively developing
attractive oil and natural gas resources, developing and applying high-impact
technologies, and pursuing productivity and efficiency gains. these strategies
are underpinned by a relentless focus on operational excellence, development of
our employees, and investment in the communities within which we operate.
as
future development projects and drilling activities bring new production
online, the corporation expects a shift in the geographic mix and in the type
of opportunities from which volumes are produced. oil equivalent production
from north
managements discussion and analysis of
financial condition and results of operations
america is expected to increase over the
next several years based on current investment plans, contributing over a third
of total production. further, the proportion of our global production from
resource types utilizing specialized technologies such as arctic, deepwater,
unconventional drilling and production systems and lng, is a slight majority of
production and is expected to grow over the next few years. we do not
anticipate that the expected change in the geographic mix of production
volumes, and in the types of opportunities from which volumes will be produced,
will have a material impact on the nature and the extent of the risks disclosed
in item 1a. risk factors, or result in a material change in our level of unit
operating expenses.
the
corporation anticipates several projects will come online over the next few
years providing additional production capacity. however, actual volumes will
vary from year to year due to the timing of individual project start-ups;
operational outages; reservoir performance; performance of enhanced oil
recovery projects; regulatory changes; the impact of fiscal and commercial
terms; asset sales; weather events; price effects on production sharing
contracts; changes in the amount and timing of capital investments that may
vary depending on the oil and gas price environment; and other factors
described in item 1a. risk factors.
the
upstream industry environment has been challenged in recent years with abundant
crude oil supply causing crude oil prices to decrease to levels not seen since
2004, and natural gas prices declined with increased supply. however, current
market conditions are not necessarily indicative of future conditions. the
markets for crude oil and natural gas have a history of significant price
volatility. exxonmobil believes prices over the long term will continue to be
driven by market supply and demand, with the demand side largely being a
function of global economic growth. on the supply side, prices may be
significantly impacted by political events, the actions of opec and other large
government resource owners, and other factors. to manage the risks associated
with price, exxonmobil evaluates annual plans and major investments across a
range of price scenarios.
downstream
exxonmobils
downstream is a large, diversified business with refining, logistics, and
marketing complexes around the world. the corporation has a presence in mature
markets in north america and europe, as well as in the growing asia pacific
region.
exxonmobils
fundamental downstream business strategies competitively position the company
across a range of market conditions. these strategies include targeting bestinclass
operations in all aspects of the business, maximizing value from advanced
technologies, capitalizing on integration across exxonmobil businesses,
selectively investing for resilient, advantaged returns, operating efficiently
and effectively, and providing quality, valued and differentiated products and
services to customers.
exxonmobils
operating results, as noted in item 2. properties, reflect 22refineries,
located in 14countries, with distillation capacity of 4.9million
barrels per day and lubricant basestock manufacturing capacity of126
thousand barrels per day. exxonmobils fuels and lubes marketing businesses
have significant global reach, with multiple channels to market serving a
diverse customer base. our portfolio of world-renowned brands includes exxon,
mobil, esso and mobil1.
while
demand remained strong in 2016, margins weakened as surplus distillate and
gasoline production capacity created high inventories. north american
refineries which benefited from costcompetitive feedstock and energy
supplies saw lower margins as the differential between brent and wti narrowed
after the elimination of the u.s. crude export ban. margins in europe and asia
weakened versus 2015, but reductions in supply and rising asia demand kept
those markets above bottomofcycle conditions seen in 2014. in the
near term, we see variability in refining margins, with some regions seeing
weaker margins as new capacity additions are expected to outpace growth in
global demand for our products, which can also be affected by global economic
conditions and regulatory changes.
refining
margins are largely driven by differences in commodity prices and are a
function of the difference between what a refinery pays for its raw materials
(primarily crude oil) and the market prices for the range of products produced
(primarily gasoline, heating oil, diesel oil, jet fuel and fuel oil). crude oil
and many products are widely traded with published prices, including those
quoted on multiple exchanges around the world (e.g., new york mercantile
exchange and intercontinental exchange). prices for these commodities are
determined by the global marketplace and are influenced by many factors,
including global and regional supply/demand balances, inventory levels,
industry refinery operations, import/export balances, currency fluctuations, seasonal
demand, weather and political climate.
exxonmobils
longterm outlook is that industry refining margins will remain subject
to intense competition as new capacity additions outpace the growth in global
demand. exxonmobils integration across the value chain, from refining to
marketing, enhances overall value in both fuels and lubricants businesses.
as
described in more detail in item 1a. risk factors, proposed carbon policy and
other climaterelated regulations in many countries, as well as the
continued growth in biofuels mandates, could have negative impacts on the
downstream business.
in
the retail fuels marketing business, product cost volatility has contributed to
a decline in margins. in 2016, exxonmobil expanded its branded retail site
network and progressed the multiyear transition of the direct served
(i.e., dealer, companyoperated) retail network in portions of europe and
canada to a more capitalefficient branded wholesaler model. the
companys lubricants business continues to grow, leveraging worldclass
brands and integration with industryleading basestock

refining capability. exxonmobil remains a market leader
in the highvalue synthetic lubricants sector, despite increasing
competition.
the
downstream portfolio is continually evaluated during all parts of the business
cycle, and numerous asset divestments have been made over the past decade. in
2016, the company divested its refinery in torrance, california. when investing
in the downstream, exxonmobil remains focused on selective and resilient
projects. in 2016, construction continued on a new delayed coker unit at the
refinery in antwerp, belgium, to upgrade lowvalue bunker fuel into
higher value diesel products. construction also progressed on a proprietary
hydrocracker at the refinery in rotterdam, netherlands, to produce higher value
ultra-low sulfur diesel and group ii basestocks. the taicang, china, lubricants
plant expansion was completed in april 2016, doubling the capacity of the
facility. the port allen aviation lubricants plant in louisiana achieved full
production during the year, and an expansion in singapore is underway to
support demand growth for finished lubricants in key markets. finally, exxonmobil
announced plans to increase production of ultra-low sulfur fuels at the
beaumont, texas, refinery by approximately 40,000 barrels per day.
chemical
worldwide
petrochemical demand remained strong in 2016, led by growing demand from asia
pacific manufacturers of industrial and consumer products. north america
continued to benefit from abundant supplies of natural gas and gas liquids,
providing both lowcost feedstock and energy. specialty product margins
moderated in 2016 with capacity additions exceeding demand growth.
exxonmobil
sustained its competitive advantage through continued operational excellence,
investment and cost discipline, a balanced portfolio of products, and
integration with refining and upstream operations, all underpinned by
proprietary technology.
in
2016, we completed startup of the specialty elastomers project at our joint
venture facility in al-jubail, saudi arabia. construction continued on a major
expansion at our texas facilities, including a new world-scale ethane cracker
and polyethylene lines, to capitalize on low-cost feedstock and energy supplies
in north america and to meet rapidly growing demand for premium polymers.
construction of new halobutyl rubber and hydrocarbon resin units also
progressed in singapore to further extend our specialty product capacity in
asia pacific. the company also announced plans to expand its polyethylene plant
in beaumont, texas, and specialty elastomers plant in newport, wales.

upstream earnings were $196million
in 2016 and included an asset impairment charge of $2,027million mainly
related to dry gas operations with undeveloped acreage in the rocky mountains
region of the u.s. current year earnings were down $6,905million from
2015. lower realizations decreased earnings by $5.3billion. favorable
volume and mix effects increased earnings by $130million. the impairment
charge reduced earnings by $2billion. all other items increased earnings
by $310million, primarily due to lower expenses partly offset by the
absence of favorable tax items from the prior year. on an oil equivalent basis,
production of 4.1million barrels per day was down slightly compared to
2015. liquids production of 2.4million barrels per day increased 20,000barrels
per day with increased project volumes, mainly in canada, indonesia and
nigeria, partly offset by field decline, the impact from canadian wildfires,
and downtime notably in nigeria. natural gas production of 10.1billion
cubic feet per day decreased 388million cubic feet per day from 2015 as
field decline, regulatory restrictions in the netherlands and divestments were
partly offset by higher project volumes and work programs. u.s. upstream
earnings declined $3,072million from 2015 to a loss of
$4,151million, and included the impairment charge of $2,027million.
earnings outside the u.s. were $4,347million, down $3,833million
from the prior year.
upstream earnings were $7,101million,
down $20,447million from 2014. lower realizations decreased earnings by
$18.8billion. favorable volume and mix effects increased earnings by
$810million, including contributions from new developments. all other
items decreased earnings by $2.4billion, primarily due to lower asset
management gains and approximately $500million of lower favorable onetime
tax effects, partly offset by lower expenses of about $230million. on an oilequivalent basis,
production of 4.1million barrels per day was up 3.2percent compared
to 2014. liquids production of 2.3million barrels per day increased
234,000barrels per day, with project rampup and entitlement
effects partly offset by field decline. natural gas production of
10.5billion cubic feet per day decreased 630million cubic feet per
day from 2014 as regulatory restrictions in the netherlands and field decline
were partly offset by project rampup, work programs and entitlement
effects. u.s. upstream

listed below are
descriptions of exxonmobils volumes reconciliation factors which are provided
to facilitate understanding of the terms.
entitlements - net interest are changes to exxonmobils share of
production volumes caused by non-operational changes to volumedetermining
factors. these factors consist of net interest changes specified in production
sharing contracts (pscs) which typically occur when cumulative investment
returns or production volumes achieve defined thresholds, changes in equity
upon achieving pay-out in partner investment carry situations, equity
redeterminations as specified in venture agreements, or as a result of the
termination or expiry of a concession. once a net interest change has occurred,
it typically will not be reversed by subsequent events, such as lower crude oil
prices.
entitlements - price, spend and other are changes to exxonmobils share of production
volumes resulting from temporary changes to non-operational volume-determining
factors. these factors include changes in oil and gas prices or spending levels
from one period to another. according to the terms of contractual arrangements
or government royalty regimes, price or spending variability can increase or
decrease royalty burdens and/or volumes attributable to exxonmobil. for
example, at higher prices, fewer barrels are required for exxonmobil to recover
its costs. these effects generally vary from period to period with field
spending patterns or market prices for oil and natural gas. such factors can
also include other temporary changes in net interest as dictated by specific
provisions in production agreements.
quotas are changes in exxonmobils allowable production arising
from production constraints imposed by countries which are members of the
organization of the petroleum exporting countries (opec). volumes reported in
this category would have been readily producible in the absence of the quota.
divestments are reductions in exxonmobils production
arising from commercial arrangements to fully or partially reduce equity in a
field or asset in exchange for financial or other economic consideration.
growth and other factors comprise all other operational
and non-operational factors not covered by the above definitions that may
affect volumes attributable to exxonmobil. such factors include, but are not
limited to, production enhancements from project and work program activities,
acquisitions including additions from asset exchanges, downtime, market demand,
natural field decline, and any fiscal or commercial terms that do not affect
entitlements.

cash and cash equivalents were $3.7 billion at the end of 2016, essentially in
line with the prior year. the major sources of funds in 2016 were net income
including noncontrolling interests of $8.4 billion, the adjustment for the
noncash provision of $22.3billion for depreciation and depletion,
proceeds from asset sales of $4.3 billion, and a net debt increase of $4.3
billion. the major uses of funds included spending for additions to property,
plant and equipment of $16.2 billion, dividends to shareholders of
$12.5billion, the adjustment for non-cash deferred income tax credits of
$4.4 billion, and a change in working capital, excluding cash and debt, of $1.4
billion.
total
cash and cash equivalents were $3.7 billion at the end of 2015, $1.0 billion
lower than the prior year. the major sources of funds in 2015 were net income
including noncontrolling interests of $16.6 billion, the adjustment for the
noncash provision of $18.0billion for depreciation and depletion, and a
net debt increase of $9.3 billion. the major uses of funds included spending for
additions to property, plant and equipment of $26.5 billion, the purchase of
shares of exxonmobil stock of $4.0 billion, dividends to shareholders of $12.1
billion and a change in working capital, excluding cash and debt, of $3.1
billion.
the
corporation has access to significant capacity of long-term and short-term
liquidity. internally generated funds are expected to cover the majority of
financial requirements, supplemented by long-term and short-term debt. on
december 31, 2016, the corporation had unused committed short-term lines of
credit of $5.5 billion and unused committed long-term lines of credit of
$0.3billion. cash that may be temporarily available as surplus to the
corporations immediate needs is carefully managed through counterparty quality
and investment guidelines to ensure it is secure and readily available to meet
the corporations cash requirements and to optimize returns.
to
support cash flows in future periods the corporation will need to continually
find and develop new fields, and continue to develop and apply new technologies
and recovery processes to existing fields, in order to maintain or increase
production. after a period of production at plateau rates, it is the nature of
oil and gas fields eventually to produce at declining rates for the remainder
of their economic life. averaged over all the corporations existing oil and
gas fields and without new projects, exxonmobils production is expected to
decline at an average of approximately 3 percent per year over the next few
years. decline rates can vary widely by individual field due to a number of
factors, including, but not limited to, the type of reservoir, fluid
properties, recovery mechanisms, work activity, and age of the field.
furthermore, the corporations net interest in production for individual fields
can vary with price and the impact of fiscal and commercial terms.
the
corporation has long been successful at offsetting the effects of natural field
decline through disciplined investments in quality opportunities and project
execution. the corporation anticipates several projects will come online over
the next few years providing additional production capacity. however, actual
volumes will vary from year to year due to the timing of individual project
startups; operational outages; reservoir performance; performance of
enhanced oil recovery projects; regulatory changes; the impact of fiscal and
commercial terms; asset sales; weather events; price effects on production
sharing contracts; and changes in the amount and timing of investments that may
vary depending on the oil and gas price environment. the corporations cash
flows are also highly dependent on crude oil and natural gas prices. please
refer to item1a. risk factors for a more complete discussion of risks.
managements discussion and analysis of
financial condition and results of operations
the corporations financial strength
enables it to make large, long-term capital expenditures. capital and
exploration expenditures in 2016 were $19.3 billion, reflecting the
corporations continued active investment program. the corporation anticipates
an investment level of $22 billion in 2017. the corporation is emerging from
several years of high capital expenditure levels that supported major
long-plateau production projects coming on line. lower levels of capital
spending over the next few years, partly due to cost savings and capital
efficiencies, are not expected to delay major project schedules nor have a
material effect on our volume capacity outlook.
actual
spending could vary depending on the progress of individual projects and
property acquisitions. the corporation has a large and diverse portfolio of development
projects and exploration opportunities, which helps mitigate the overall
political and technical risks of the corporations upstream segment and
associated cash flow. further, due to its financial strength, debt capacity and
diverse portfolio of opportunities, the risk associated with failure or delay
of any single project would not have a significant impact on the corporations
liquidity or ability to generate sufficient cash flows for operations and its
fixed commitments.

cash flow from financing activities
cash
used in financing activities was $9.3 billion in 2016, $2.3 billion higher than
2015. dividend payments on common shares increased to $2.98 per share from
$2.88 per share and totaled $12.5 billion. total debt increased $4.1 billion to
$42.8 billion at yearend. the first quarter issuance of $12.0 billion in
long-term debt was partly offset by repayments of $8.0 billion in commercial
paper and other short-term debt during the year.
exxonmobil
share of equity decreased $3.5 billion to $167.3 billion. the addition to
equity for earnings was $7.8 billion. this was offset by reductions for
distributions to exxonmobil shareholders of $12.5 billion, all in the form of
dividends. foreign exchange translation effects of $0.3 billion for the
stronger u.s. currency reduced equity, while a $1.6 billion change in the
funded status of the postretirement benefits reserves increased equity.
during 2016, exxon mobil corporation acquired
12 million shares of its common stock for the treasury at a gross cost of
$1.0billion. these purchases were made to offset shares or units settled
in shares issued in conjunction with the companys benefit plans and programs.
shares outstanding were reduced from 4,156 million to 4,148 million at the end
of 2016.
cash
used in financing activities was $7.0 billion in 2015, $10.9 billion lower than
2014. dividend payments on common shares increased to $2.88 per share from
$2.70 per share and totaled $12.1 billion, a pay-out of 75 percent of net
income. during the first quarter of 2015, the corporation issued $8.0 billion
of long-term debt. total debt increased $9.6 billion to $38.7 billion at yearend.
exxonmobil
share of equity decreased $3.6 billion to $170.8 billion. the addition to
equity for earnings was $16.2 billion. this was offset by reductions for
distributions to exxonmobil shareholders of $15.1 billion, composed of $12.1
billion in dividends and $3.0 billion of share purchases of exxonmobil stock to
reduce shares outstanding. foreign exchange translation effects of
$8.2billion for the stronger u.s. currency reduced equity, while a $3.6
billion change in the funded status of the postretirement benefits reserves
increased equity.
during 2015, exxon mobil corporation
acquired 48 million shares of its common stock for the treasury at a gross cost
of $4.0billion. these purchases were to reduce the number of shares
outstanding and to offset shares or units settled in shares issued in
conjunction with company benefit plans and programs. shares outstanding were
reduced by 1.1 percent from 4,201 million to 4,156 million at the end of 2015.
purchases were made in both the open market and through negotiated
transactions. purchases may be increased, decreased or discontinued at any time
without prior notice.

table excludes commodity purchase obligations (volumetric commitments but no
fixed or minimum price) which are resold shortly after purchase, either in an
active, highly liquid market or under long-term, unconditional sales contracts
with similar pricing terms. examples include long-term, noncancelable lng and
natural gas purchase commitments and commitments to purchase refinery products
at market prices. inclusion of such commitments would not be meaningful in
assessing liquidity and cash flow, because these purchases will be offset in
the same periods by cash received from the related sales transactions. the
table also excludes unrecognized tax benefits totaling $9.5 billion as of
december31, 2016, because the corporation is unable to make reasonably
reliable estimates of the timing of cash settlements with the respective taxing
authorities. further details on the unrecognized tax benefits can be found in note
19: income, sales-based and other taxes.
notes:
(1) includes capitalized lease
obligations of $1,225 million.
(2) the amount due in one year is
included in notes and loans payable of $13,830 million.
(3) the fair value of asset retirement
obligations, primarily upstream asset removal costs at the completion of field
life.
(4) the amount by which the benefit
obligations exceeded the fair value of fund assets for certain u.s. and
non-u.s. pension and other postretirement plans at year-end. the payments by
period include expected contributions to funded pension plans in 2017 and
estimated benefit payments for unfunded plans in all years.
(5) minimum commitments for operating
leases, shown on an undiscounted basis, cover drilling equipment, tankers,
service stations and other properties. total includes $836 million related to
drilling rigs and related equipment.
(6) take-or-pay obligations are
noncancelable, long-term commitments for goods and services. unconditional
purchase obligations are those long-term commitments that are noncancelable or
cancelable only under certain conditions, and that third parties have used to
secure financing for the facilities that will provide the contracted goods or
services. the undiscounted obligations of $21,580 million mainly pertain to
pipeline, manufacturing supply and terminal agreements.
(7) firm capital commitments represent
legally binding payment obligations to third parties where agreements
specifying all significant terms have been executed for the construction and
purchase of fixed assets and other permanent investments. in certain cases
where the corporation executes contracts requiring commitments to a work scope,
those commitments have been included to the extent that the amounts and timing
of payments can be reliably estimated. firm capital commitments, shown on an
undiscounted basis, totaled $10.4 billion, including $2.8 billion in the u.s.
firm capital commitments for the non-u.s. upstream of $6.9 billion were
primarily associated with projects in the united arab emirates, africa,
malaysia, canada, australia and norway. the corporation expects to fund the
majority of these commitments with internally generated funds, supplemented by
long-term and short-term debt.
managements discussion and analysis of
financial condition and results of operations
guarantees
the
corporation and certain of its consolidated subsidiaries were contingently
liable at december31, 2016, for guarantees relating to notes, loans and
performance under contracts (note 16). where guarantees for environmental
remediation and other similar matters do not include a stated cap, the amounts
reflect managements estimate of the maximum potential exposure. these guarantees
are not reasonably likely to have a material effect on the corporations
financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses,
results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.
financial strength
on december31, 2016, the
corporations unused short-term committed lines of credit totaled $5.5 billion
(note 6) and unused long-term committed lines of credit totaled $0.3 billion
(note 14). the table below shows the corporations fixed-charge coverage
andconsolidated debt-to-capital ratios. the data demonstrate the
corporations creditworthiness.

management
views the corporations financial strength, as evidenced by the above financial
ratios and other similar measures, to be a competitive advantage of strategic
importance. the corporations sound financial position gives it the opportunity
to access the worlds capital markets in the full range of market conditions,
and enables the corporation to take on large, long-term capital commitments in
the pursuit of maximizing shareholder value.
litigation and other contingencies
as
discussed in note 16, a variety of claims have been made against exxonmobil and
certain of its consolidated subsidiaries in a number of pending lawsuits. based
on a consideration of all relevant facts and circumstances, the corporation
does not believe the ultimate outcome of any currently pending lawsuit against
exxonmobil will have a material adverse effect upon the corporations
operations, financial condition, or financial statements taken as a whole.
there are no events or uncertainties beyond those already included in reported
financial information that would indicate a material change in future operating
results or financial condition. refer to note 16 for additional information on
legal proceedings and other contingencies.

capital
and exploration expenditures in 2016 were $19.3 billion, as the corporation
continued to pursue opportunities to find and produce new supplies of oil and
natural gas to meet global demand for energy. the corporation anticipates an investment
level of $22 billion in 2017. actual spending could vary depending on the
progress of individual projects and property acquisitions.
upstream
spending of $14.5 billion in 2016 was down 43 percent from 2015, reflecting key
project start-ups and capital efficiencies. investments in 2016 included u.s.
onshore drilling and world-class projects in kazakhstan, canada and australia. the
majority of expenditures are on development projects, which typically take two
to four years from the time of recording proved undeveloped reserves to the
start of production. the percentage of proved developed reserves was 69 percent
of total proved reserves at yearend 2016, and has been over 60 percent
for the last ten years.
capital investments in the downstream
totaled $2.5 billion in 2016, a decrease of $0.2 billion from 2015, mainly
reflecting lower refining project spending. chemical capital expenditures of $2.2
billion decreased $0.6 billion from 2015 resulting from progression of major
expansions.

throughout
exxonmobils businesses, new and ongoing measures aretaken to prevent and
minimize the impact of our operations on air,water and ground. these
include a significant investment in refining infrastructure and technology to
manufacture clean fuels, as well asprojects to monitor and reduce
nitrogen oxide, sulfur oxide and greenhouse gas emissions, and expenditures for
asset retirement obligations. using definitions and guidelines established by
the american petroleum institute, exxonmobils 2016 worldwide environmental
expenditures for all such preventative and remediation steps, including exxonmobils
share of equity company expenditures, were $4.9billion, of which $3.5billion
were included in expenses with the remainder in capital expenditures. the total
cost for such activities is expected to remain relatively flat at approximately
$5billion in 2017 and 2018. capital expenditures are expected to account
for approximately 30percent of the total.
environmental liabilities
the corporation accrues environmental
liabilities when it is probable that obligations have been incurred and the
amounts can be reasonably estimated. this policy applies to assets or
businesses currently owned or previously disposed. exxonmobil has accrued
liabilities for probable environmental remediation obligations at various
sites, including multiparty sites where the u.s. environmental protection
agency has identified exxonmobil as one of the potentially responsible parties.
the involvement of other financially responsible companies at these multiparty
sites could mitigate exxonmobils actual joint and several liability exposure.
at present, no individual site is expected to have losses material to
exxonmobils operations or financial condition. consolidated company provisions
made in 2016 for environmental liabilities were $665million ($371million
in 2015) and the balance sheet reflects accumulated liabilities of $852million
as of december31, 2016, and $837million as of december31, 2015.

crude
oil, natural gas, petroleum product and chemical prices have fluctuated in
response to changing market forces. the impacts of these price fluctuations on
earnings from upstream, downstream and chemical operations have varied. in the
upstream, a $1perbarrel change in the weighted-average realized
price of oil would have approximately a $400 million annual after-tax effect on
upstream consolidated plus equity company earnings. similarly, a $0.10 per thousand
cubic feet change in the worldwide average gas realization would have approximately
a $150 million annual after-tax effect on upstream consolidated plus equity
company earnings. for any given period, the extent of actual benefit or
detriment will be dependent on the price movements of individual types of crude
oil, taxes and other government take impacts, price adjustment lags in
long-term gas contracts, and crude and gas production volumes. accordingly,
changes in benchmark prices for crude oil and natural gas only provide broad
indicators of changes in the earnings experienced in any particular period.
in
the very competitive downstream and chemical environments, earnings are
primarily determined by margin capture rather than absolute price levels of
products sold. refining margins are a function of the difference between what a
refiner pays for its raw materials (primarily crude oil) and the market prices
for the range of products produced. these prices in turn depend on global and
regional supply/demand balances, inventory levels, refinery operations,
import/export balances and weather.
managements discussion and analysis of
financial condition and results of operations
the global
energy markets can give rise to extended periods in which market conditions are
adverse to one or more of the corporations businesses. such conditions, along
with the capital-intensive nature of the industry and very long lead times
associated with many of our projects, underscore the importance of maintaining
a strong financial position. management views the corporations financial
strength as a competitive advantage.
in
general, segment results are not dependent on the ability to sell and/or
purchase products to/from other segments. instead, where such sales take place,
they are the result of efficiencies and competitive advantages of integrated
refinery/chemical complexes. additionally, intersegment sales are at
market-based prices. the products bought and sold between segments can also be
acquired in worldwide markets that have substantial liquidity, capacity and
transportation capabilities. about 35 percent of the corporations intersegment
sales represent upstream production sold to the downstream. other intersegment
sales include those between refineries and chemical plants related to raw
materials, feedstocks and finished products.
although
price levels of crude oil and natural gas may rise or fall significantly over
the short to medium term due to global economic conditions, political events, decisions
by opec and other major government resource owners and other factors, industry
economics over the long term will continue to be driven by market supply and
demand. accordingly, the corporation evaluates the viability of its major investments
over a range of prices.
the
corporation has an active asset management program in which underperforming
assets are either improved to acceptable levels or considered for divestment.
the asset management program includes a disciplined, regular review to ensure
that all assets are contributing to the corporations strategic objectives
resulting in an efficient capital base.
risk management
the
corporations size, strong capital structure, geographic diversity and the
complementary nature of the upstream, downstream and chemical businesses reduce
the corporations enterprise-wide risk from changes in interest rates, currency
rates and commodity prices. as a result, the corporation makes limited use of
derivative instruments to mitigate the impact of such changes. with respect to
derivatives activities, the corporation believes that there are no material
market or credit risks to the corporations financial position, results of
operations or liquidity as a result of the derivatives described in note 13.
the corporation does not engage in speculative derivative activities or
derivative trading activities nor does it use derivatives with leveraged
features. credit risk associated with the corporations derivative position is
mitigated by several factors, including the use of derivative clearing
exchanges and the quality of and financial limits placed on derivative
counterparties. the corporation maintains a system of controls that includes
the authorization, reporting and monitoring of derivative activity.
the
corporation is exposed to changes in interest rates, primarily on its short-term
debt and the portion of long-term debt that carries floating interest rates.
the impact of a 100-basis-point change in interest rates affecting the
corporations debt would not be material to earnings, cash flow or fair value. the
corporation has access to significant capacity of long-term and short-term
liquidity. internally generated funds are expected to cover the majority of
financial requirements, supplemented by long-term and short-term debt. some
joint-venture partners are dependent on the credit markets, and their funding
ability may impact the development pace of joint-venture projects.
the
corporation conducts business in many foreign currencies and is subject to
exchange rate risk on cash flows related to sales, expenses, financing and
investment transactions. the impacts of fluctuations in exchange rates on
exxonmobils geographically and functionally diverse operations are varied and
often offsetting in amount. the corporation makes limited use of currency
exchange contracts to mitigate the impact of changes in currency values, and
exposures related to the corporations limited use of the currency exchange
contracts are not material.
inflation and other uncertainties
the
general rate of inflation in many major countries of operation has remained
moderate over the past few years, and the associated impact on non-energy costs
has generally been mitigated by cost reductions from efficiency and
productivity improvements. beginning several years ago, an extended period of
increased demand for certain services and materials resulted in higher
operating and capital costs. more recently, multiple market changes, including
general commodity price decreases, lower oil prices and reduced upstream industry
activity, have contributed to lower prices for oilfield services and materials.
the corporation works to minimize costs in all commodity price environments through
its economies of scale in global procurement and its efficient project
management practices.
managements discussion and analysis of
financial condition and results of operations
recently
issued accounting standards
in
may 2014, the financial accounting standards board issued a new standard, revenue
from contracts with customers. the standard establishes a single revenue
recognition model for all contracts with customers, eliminates industry
specific requirements, and expands disclosure requirements. the standard is
required to be adopted beginning january 1, 2018. sales and other operating
revenue on the consolidated statement of income includes sales, excise and
value-added taxes on sales transactions. when the corporation adopts the standard,
revenue will exclude sales-based taxes collected on behalf of third parties.
this change in reporting will not impact earnings. the corporation expects to
adopt the standard using the modified retrospective method, under which prior
years results are not restated, but supplemental information on the impact of
the new standard is provided for 2018 results. the corporation continues to
evaluate other areas of the standard, which are not expected to have a material
effect on the corporations financial statements.
in
february 2016, the financial accounting standards board issued a new standard, leases.
the standard requires that all leases with an initial term greater than one
year be recorded on the balance sheet as a lease asset and a lease liability.
the standard is required to be adopted beginning january 1, 2019, with early
adoption permitted. exxonmobil is evaluating the standard and its effect on the
corporations financial statements and plans to adopt it in 2019.
critical accounting estimates
the
corporations accounting and financial reporting fairly reflect its
straightforward business model involving the extracting, refining and marketing
of hydrocarbons and hydrocarbon-based products. the preparation of financial
statements in conformity with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles
(gaap) requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the
reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and the
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. the corporations accounting
policies are summarized in note 1.
oil and natural gas reserves
the
estimation of proved reserves is an ongoing process based on rigorous technical
evaluations, commercial and market assessment, and detailed analysis of well
information such as flow rates and reservoir pressure declines, among other
factors. the estimation of proved reserves is controlled by the corporation
through long-standing approval guidelines. reserve changes are made within a
well-established, disciplined process driven by senior level geoscience and
engineering professionals, assisted by the global reserves group which has
significant technical experience, culminating in reviews with and approval by
senior management. notably, the corporation does not use specific quantitative
reserve targets to determine compensation. key features of the reserve
estimation process are covered in disclosure of reserves in item2.
oil
and natural gas reserves include both proved and unproved reserves.
proved oil and natural gas
reserves are determined in accordance with securities and exchange commission
(sec) requirements. proved reserves are those quantities of oil and natural gas
which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with
reasonable certainty to be economically producible under existing economic and
operating conditions and government regulations. proved reserves are determined
using the average of first-of-month oil and natural gas prices during the
reporting year.
proved
reserves can be further subdivided into developed and undeveloped reserves.
proved developed reserves include amounts which are expected to be recovered
through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods. proved
undeveloped reserves include amounts expected to be recovered from new wells on
undrilled proved acreage or from existing wells where a relatively major
expenditure is required for completion. proved undeveloped reserves are
recognized only if a development plan has been adopted indicating that the
reserves are scheduled to be drilled within five years, unless specific
circumstances support a longer period of time.
the
percentage of proved developed reserves was 69 percent of total proved reserves
at year-end 2016 (including both consolidated and equity company reserves), a
reduction from 73 percent in 2015, and has been over 60 percent for the last
ten years. although the corporation is reasonably certain that proved reserves
will be produced, the timing and amount recovered can be affected by a number
of factors including completion of development projects, reservoir performance,
regulatory approvals and significant changes in long-term oil and natural gas
prices.
unproved reserves are quantities
of oil and natural gas with less than reasonable certainty of recoverability
and include probable reserves. probable reserves are reserves that, together
with proved reserves, are as likely as not to be recovered.
revisions in
previously estimated volumes of proved reserves for existing fields can occur due
to the evaluation or re-evaluation of (1)already available geologic,
reservoir or production data, (2)new geologic, reservoir or production
data or (3)changes in the
managements discussion and analysis of
financial condition and results of operations
average of
first-of-month oil and natural gas prices and / or costs that are used in the
estimation of reserves. revisions can also result from significant changes in
development strategy or production equipment and facility capacity.
as a
result of very low prices during 2016, under the sec definition of proved reserves, certain quantities
of oil and natural gas that qualified as proved reserves in prior years did not
qualify as proved reserves at yearend 2016. amounts no longer qualifying
as proved reserves include the entire 3.5 billion barrels of bitumen at kearl,
in canada. in addition, 0.8 billion barrels of oil equivalent across the
remainder of north america no longer qualify as proved reserves mainly due to
the acceleration of the projected end-of-field-life. among the factors that
would result in these amounts being recognized again as proved reserves at some
point in the future are a recovery in average price levels, a further decline
in costs, and / or operating efficiencies. under the terms of certain
contractual arrangements or government royalty regimes, lower prices can also
increase proved reserves attributable to exxonmobil. we do not expect the
downward revision of reported proved reserves under sec definitions to affect
the operation of the underlying projects or to alter our outlook for future
production volumes.
supplemental
information regarding oil and natural gas results of operations, capitalized
costs and reserves is provided following the notes to consolidated financial
statements.
unit-of-production
depreciation
oil
and natural gas reserve quantities are used as the basis to calculate
unit-of-production depreciation rates for most upstream assets. depreciation is
calculated by taking the ratio of asset cost to total proved reserves or proved
developed reserves applied to actual production. the volumes produced and asset
cost are known, while proved reserves are based on estimates that are subject
to some variability.
in the
event that the unit-of-production method does not result in an equitable
allocation of cost over the economic life of an upstream asset, an alternative
method is used. the straight-line method is used in limited situations where
the expected life of the asset does not reasonably correlate with that of the
underlying reserves. for example, certain assets used in the production of oil
and natural gas have a shorter life than the reserves, and as such, the
corporation uses straight-line depreciation to ensure the asset is fully
depreciated by the end of its useful life.
to the
extent that proved reserves for a property are entirely de-booked and that
property continues to produce, assets will be depreciated using a
unit-of-production method based on reserves determined at the most recent sec
price which results in a quantity of proved reserves greater than zero,
appropriately adjusted for production and technical changes. the effect of this
approach on the corporations 2017 depreciation expense versus 2016 is
anticipated to be immaterial.
impairment
the
corporation tests assets or groups of assets for recoverability whenever events
or circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable.
among the events or changes in circumstances which could indicate that the
carrying value of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable are the
following:
a significant decrease in the
market price of a long-lived asset;
a significant adverse change in
the extent or manner in which an asset is being used or in its physical
condition including a significant decrease in current and projected reserve
volumes;
a significant adverse change in
legal factors or in the business climate that could affect the value, including
an adverse action or assessment by a regulator;
an accumulation of project costs significantly
in excess of the amount originally expected;
a current-period operating loss
combined with a history and forecast of operating or cash flow losses; and
a current expectation that, more
likely than not, a long-lived asset will be sold or otherwise disposed of
significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life.
the
corporation performs asset valuation analyses on an ongoing basis as a part of
its asset management program. these analyses and other profitability reviews
assist the corporation in assessing whether the carrying amounts of any of its
assets may not be recoverable.
in
general, the corporation does not view temporarily low prices or margins as an
indication of impairment. management does not believe that lower prices are
sustainable if energy is to be delivered with supply security to meet global
demand over the long term. although prices will occasionally drop
significantly, industry prices over the long term will continue to be driven by
market supply and demand. on the supply side, industry production from mature
fields is declining, but this is being offset by production from new
discoveries and field developments. opec production policies also have an
impact on world oil supplies. the demand side is largely a function of global
economic growth. because the lifespans of the vast majority of the
corporations major assets are measured in decades, the value of these assets
is predominantly based on long-term views of future commodity prices and
managements discussion and analysis of
financial condition and results of operations
production costs. during the lifespan of these major
assets, the corporation expects that oil and gas prices will experience
significant volatility, and consequently these assets will experience periods
of higher earnings and periods of lower earnings, or even losses. in assessing
whether the events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of
an asset may not be recoverable, the corporation considers recent periods of
operating losses in the context of its longer-term view of prices. while
near-term prices are subject to wide fluctuations, longer-term price views are
more stable and meaningful for purposes of assessing future cash flows.
when
the industry experiences a prolonged and deep reduction in commodity prices,
the market supply and demand conditions may result in changes to the
corporations long-term price or margin assumptions it uses for its capital
investment decisions. to the extent those changes result in a significant
reduction in the mid-point of its long-term oil, natural gas price or margin
ranges, the corporation may consider that situation, in conjunction with other
events and changes in circumstances such as a history of operating losses, an
indicator of potential impairment for certain assets.
in the
upstream, the standardized measure of discounted cash flows included in the
supplemental information on oil and gas exploration and production activities
is required to use prices based on the average of first-of-month prices. these
prices represent discrete points in time and could be higher or lower than the
corporations long-term price assumptions which are used for impairment
assessments. the corporation believes the standardized measure does not provide
a reliable estimate of the expected future cash flows to be obtained from the
development and production of its oil and gas properties or of the value of its
oil and gas reserves and therefore does not consider it relevant in determining
whether events or changes in circumstances indicate the need for an impairment
assessment.
if
events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be
recoverable, the corporation estimates the future undiscounted cash flows of
the affected properties to judge the recoverability of carrying amounts. in
performing this assessment, assets are grouped at the lowest level for which
there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash
flows of other groups of assets. cash flows used in recoverability assessments
are based on the corporations assumptions which are developed in the annual planning
and budgeting process, and are consistent with the criteria management uses to
evaluate investment opportunities. these evaluations make use of the
corporations assumptions of future crude oil and natural gas commodity prices,
refining and chemical margins, volumes, costs, and foreign currency exchange
rates. volumes are based on projected field and facility production profiles,
throughput, or sales. where unproved reserves exist, an appropriately
risk-adjusted amount of these reserves may be included in the evaluation. cash
flow estimates for impairment testing exclude the effects of derivative
instruments.
an
asset group is impaired if its undiscounted cash flows are less than the
assets carrying value. impairments are measured by the amount by which the
carrying value exceeds fair value. fair value is based on market prices if an
active market exists for the asset group, or discounted cash flows using a
discount rate commensurate with the risk. significant unproved properties are
assessed for impairment individually, and valuation allowances against the
capitalized costs are recorded based on the estimated economic chance of
success and the length of time that the corporation expects to hold the
properties. properties that are not individually significant are aggregated by
groups and amortized based on development risk and average holding period.
continued
weakness in the upstream industry environment during 2016, continued weak
financial results for several assets in north america, and a reduction in the
mid-point of the ranges of the corporations long-term oil and natural gas
prices developed as part of its annual planning and budgeting cycle led the
corporation to conclude that the facts and circumstances supported performing
an impairment assessment of certain long-lived assets, notably north america
natural gas assets and certain other assets across the remainder of its
upstream operations. the assessment reflected long-term crude and natural gas
prices which are consistent with the mid-point of the ranges that management
uses to evaluate investment opportunities and which are in the range of
long-term price forecasts published by third-party industry experts and
government agencies. this assessment indicated that the vast majority of asset
groups have future undiscounted cash flow estimates exceeding carrying values.
however, the carrying values for certain asset groups in the united states
exceeded the estimated cash flows. as a result, the corporations fourth
quarter 2016 results include an after-tax charge of $2 billion to reduce the
carrying value of those assets to fair value. the asset groups subject to this
impairment charge are primarily dry gas operations in the rocky mountains
region of the united states with large undeveloped acreage positions.
the
assessment of fair values required the use of level 3 inputs. the principal
parameters used to establish fair values included estimates of both proved and
unproved reserves, future commodity prices which were consistent with the
average of third-party industry experts and government agencies, drilling and
development costs, discount rates ranging from 5.5 percent to 8 percent
depending on the characteristics of the asset group, and comparable market
transactions. due to the inherent difficulty in predicting future commodity
prices, and the relationship between industry prices and costs, it is not
practicable to reasonably estimate the existence or range of any potential
future impairment charges related to the corporations long-lived assets.
managements discussion and analysis of
financial condition and results of operations
inventories
crude
oil, products and merchandise inventories are carried at the lower of current
market value or cost (generally determined under the last-in, first-out method
lifo).
asset retirement obligations
the
corporation incurs retirement obligations for certain assets. the fair values of
these obligations are recorded as liabilities on a discounted basis, which is
typically at the time the assets are installed. in the estimation of fair
value, the corporation uses assumptions and judgments regarding such factors as
the existence of a legal obligation for an asset retirement obligation;
technical assessments of the assets; estimated amounts and timing of
settlements; discount rates; and inflation rates. asset retirement obligations
are disclosed in note 9 to the financial statements.
suspended exploratory well costs
the
corporation continues capitalization of exploratory well costs when the well
has found a sufficient quantity of reserves to justify its completion as a
producing well and the corporation is making sufficient progress assessing the
reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project. exploratory
well costs not meeting these criteria are charged to expense. the facts and
circumstances that support continued capitalization of suspended wells at year-end
are disclosed in note 10 to the financial statements.
consolidations
the
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of those subsidiaries
that the corporation controls. they also include the corporations share of the
undivided interest in certain upstream assets, liabilities, revenues and
expenses. amounts representing the corporations interest in the underlying net
assets of other significant entities that it does not control, but over which
it exercises significant influence, are accounted for using the equity method
of accounting.
investments
in companies that are partially owned by the corporation are integral to the
corporations operations. in some cases they serve to balance worldwide risks,
and in others they provide the only available means of entry into a particular
market or area of interest. the other parties, who also have an equity interest
in these companies, are either independent third parties or host governments
that share in the business results according to their ownership. the
corporation does not invest in these companies in order to remove liabilities
from its balance sheet. in fact, the corporation has long been on record
supporting an alternative accounting method that would require each investor to
consolidate its share of all assets and liabilities in these partially-owned
companies rather than only its interest in net equity. this method of
accounting for investments in partially-owned companies is not permitted by u.s.
gaap except where the investments are in the direct ownership of a share of
upstream assets and liabilities. however, for purposes of calculating return on
average capital employed, which is not covered by u.s. gaap standards, the
corporation includes its share of debt of these partially-owned companies in
the determination of average capital employed.
pension benefits
the
corporation and its affiliates sponsor nearly 100 defined benefit (pension)
plans in over 40 countries. the pension and other postretirement benefits footnote
(note 17) provides details on pension obligations, fund assets and pension
expense.

of these plans (primarily non-u.s.) provide pension benefits that are paid
directly by their sponsoring affiliates out of corporate cash flow rather than
a separate pension fund because applicable tax rules and regulatory practices
do not encourage advance funding. book reserves are established for these
plans. the portion of the pension cost attributable to employee service is
expensed as services are rendered. the portion attributable to the increase in
pension obligations due to the passage of time is expensed over the term of the
obligations, which ends when all benefits are paid. the primary difference in
pension expense for unfunded versus funded plans is that pension expense for
funded plans also includes a credit for the expected long-term return on fund
assets.
for
funded plans, including those in the u.s., pension obligations are financed in
advance through segregated assets or insurance arrangements. these plans are
managed in compliance with the requirements of governmental authorities and
meet or exceed required funding levels as measured by relevant actuarial and
government standards at the mandated measurement dates. in determining
liabilities and required contributions, these standards often require
approaches and assumptions that differ from those used for accounting purposes.
managements discussion and analysis of
financial condition and results of operations
the corporation will continue to make
contributions to these funded plans as necessary. all defined-benefit pension
obligations, regardless of the funding status of the underlying plans, are
fully supported by the financial strength of the corporation or the respective
sponsoring affiliate.
pension
accounting requires explicit assumptions regarding, among others, the long-term
expected earnings rate on fund assets, the discount rate for the benefit
obligations and the long-term rate for future salary increases. pension
assumptions are reviewed annually by outside actuaries and senior management.
these assumptions are adjusted as appropriate to reflect changes in market
rates and outlook. the long-term expected earnings rate on u.s. pension plan
assets in 2016 was 6.50 percent. the 10year and 20year actual
returns on u.s. pension plan assets were 5 percent and 8 percent, respectively.
the corporation establishes the longterm expected rate of return by
developing a forward-looking, long-term return assumption for each pension fund
asset class, taking into account factors such as the expected real return for
the specific asset class and inflation. a single, long-term rate of return is
then calculated as the weighted average of the target asset allocation
percentages and the long-term return assumption for each asset class. a
worldwide reduction of 0.5 percent in the long-term rate of return on assets
would increase annual pension expense by approximately $160 million before tax.
differences
between actual returns on fund assets and the long-term expected return are not
recognized in pension expense in the year that the difference occurs. such
differences are deferred, along with other actuarial gains and losses, and are
amortized into pension expense over the expected remaining service life of
employees.
litigation contingencies
a
variety of claims have been made against the corporation and certain of its
consolidated subsidiaries in a number of pending lawsuits. management has
regular litigation reviews, including updates from corporate and outside
counsel, to assess the need for accounting recognition or disclosure of these
contingencies. the status of significant claims is summarized in note 16.
the
corporation accrues an undiscounted liability for those contingencies where the
incurrence of a loss is probable, and the amount can be reasonably estimated.
these amounts are not reduced by amounts that may be recovered under insurance
or claims against third parties, but undiscounted receivables from insurers or
other third parties may be accrued separately. the corporation revises such
accruals in light of new information. for contingencies where an unfavorable
outcome is reasonably possible and which are significant, the corporation
discloses the nature of the contingency and, where feasible, an estimate of the
possible loss. for purposes of our litigation contingency disclosures,
significant includes material matters as well as other items which management
believes should be disclosed.
management
judgment is required related to contingent liabilities and the outcome of
litigation because both are difficult to predict. however, the corporation has
been successful in defending litigation in the past. payments have not had a
material adverse effect on operations or financial condition. in the
corporations experience, large claims often do not result in large awards.
large awards are often reversed or substantially reduced as a result of appeal
or settlement.
tax contingencies
the
corporation is subject to income taxation in many jurisdictions around the
world. significant management judgment is required in the accounting for income
tax contingencies and tax disputes because the outcomes are often difficult to
predict.
the benefits of uncertain tax positions
that the corporation has taken or expects to take in its income tax returns are
recognized in the financial statements if management concludes that it is more
likely than not that the position will be sustained with the tax authorities.
for a position that is likely to be sustained, the benefit recognized in the
financial statements is measured at the largest amount that is greater than 50
percent likely of being realized. a reserve is established for the difference
between a position taken or expected to be taken in an income tax return and
the amount recognized in the financial statements. the corporations
unrecognized tax benefits and a description of open tax years are summarized in
note 19.
managements discussion and analysis of
financial condition and results of operations
foreign
currency translation
the
method of translating the foreign currency financial statements ofthe
corporations international subsidiaries into u.s. dollars is prescribed by
gaap. under these principles, it is necessary to select the functional currency
of these subsidiaries. the functional currency is the currency of the primary
economic environment in which the subsidiary operates. management selects the
functional currency after evaluating this economic environment.
factors
considered by management when determining the functional currency for a
subsidiary include the currency used for cash flows related to individual
assets and liabilities; the responsiveness of sales prices to changes in
exchange rates; the history of inflation in the country; whether sales are into
local markets or exported; the currency used to acquire raw materials, labor,
services and supplies; sources of financing; and significance of intercompany
transactions.
managements
report on internal control over financial reporting
management, including the
corporations chief executive officer, principal financial officer, and principal
accounting officer, is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate
internal control over the corporations financial reporting. management
conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of internal control over financial
reporting based on criteria established in internal control
integrated framework (2013) issued by the committee of sponsoring
organizations of the treadway commission. based on this evaluation, management
concluded that exxon mobil corporations internal control over financial
reporting was effective as of december31, 2016.
pricewaterhousecoopers
llp, an independent registered public accounting firm, audited the
effectiveness of the corporations internal control over financial reporting as
of december31, 2016, as stated in their report included in the financial
section of this report.

report of independent registered public accounting firm
to the shareholders of exxon
mobil corporation:
in our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance
sheets and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income,
changes in equity, and cash flows present fairly, in all material respects, the
financial position of exxon mobil corporation and its subsidiaries at
december31, 2016 and 2015, and the results of their operations and their
cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended december31, 2016
in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united
states of america. also in our opinion, the corporation maintained, in all
material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of
december31, 2016, based on criteria established in internal control
integrated framework (2013) issued by the committee of sponsoring
organizations of the treadway commission (coso). the corporations management
is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective
internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the
effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the
accompanying managements report on internal control over financial reporting.
our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements and on
the corporations internal control over financial reporting based on our
integrated audits. we conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of
the public company accounting oversight board (united states). those standards
require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance
about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and
whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in
all material respects. our audits of the financial statements included
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. our audit of internal control over financial reporting
included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial
reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and
evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on
the assessed risk. our audits also included performing such other procedures as
we considered necessary in the circumstances. we believe that our audits provide
a reasonable basis for our opinions.
a companys internal control over financial reporting is a
process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external
purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. a
companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and
procedures that (i)pertain to the maintenance of records that, in
reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and
dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii)provide reasonable
assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made
only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the
company; and (iii)provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or
timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. also, projections
of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk
that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that
the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

the
information in the notes to consolidated financial statements is an integral
part of these statements.
notes to consolidated financial statements
the accompanying consolidated financial
statements and the supporting and supplemental material are the responsibility
of the management of exxon mobil corporation.
the
corporations principal business is energy, involving the worldwide
exploration, production, transportation and sale of crude oil and natural gas
(upstream) and the manufacture, transportation and sale of petroleum products
(downstream). the corporation is also a major worldwide manufacturer and
marketer of petrochemicals (chemical).
the
preparation of financial statements in conformity with u.s. generally accepted
accounting principles (gaap) requires management to make estimates that affect
the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and the
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. actual results could differ
from these estimates. prior years data has been reclassified in certain cases
to conform to the 2016 presentation basis.
1.
summary of accounting policies
principles of consolidation
the
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of subsidiaries the
corporation controls. they also include the corporations share of the
undivided interest in certain upstream assets, liabilities, revenues and
expenses.
amounts
representing the corporations interest in entities that it does not control,
but over which it exercises significant influence, are included in
investments, advances and long-term receivables. the corporations share of
the net income of these companies is included in the consolidated statement of
income caption income from equity affiliates.
majority
ownership is normally the indicator of control that is the basis on which
subsidiaries are consolidated. however, certain factors may indicate that a
majority-owned investment is not controlled and therefore should be accounted
for using the equity method of accounting. these factors occur where the
minority shareholders are granted by law or by contract substantive
participating rights. these include the right to approve operating policies,
expense budgets, financing and investment plans, and management compensation
and succession plans.
evidence of
loss in value that might indicate impairment of investments in companies
accounted for on the equity method is assessed to determine if such evidence
represents a loss in value of the corporations investment that is other than
temporary. examples of key indicators include a history of operating losses,
negative earnings and cash flow outlook, significant downward revisions to oil
and gas reserves, and the financial condition and prospects for the investees
business segment or geographic region. if evidence of an other than temporary
loss in fair value below carrying amount is determined, an impairment is
recognized. in the absence of market prices for the investment, discounted cash
flows are used to assess fair value.
the
corporations share of the cumulative foreign exchange translation adjustment
for equity method investments is reported in accumulated other comprehensive
income.
revenue recognition
the
corporation generally sells crude oil, natural gas and petroleum and chemical
products under short-term agreements at prevailing market prices. in some cases
(e.g., natural gas), products may be sold under long-term agreements, with
periodic price adjustments. revenues are recognized when the products are
delivered, which occurs when the customer has taken title and has assumed the
risks and rewards of ownership, prices are fixed or determinable and
collectibility is reasonably assured.
revenues
from the production of natural gas properties in which the corporation has an
interest with other producers are recognized on the basis of the corporations
net working interest. differences between actual production and net working
interest volumes are not significant.
purchases
and sales of inventory with the same counterparty that are entered into in
contemplation of one another are combined and recorded as exchanges measured at
the book value of the item sold.
sales-based
taxes
the
corporation reports sales, excise and value-added taxes on sales transactions
on a gross basis in the consolidated statement of income (included in both
revenues and costs).
derivative
instruments
the corporation
makes limited use of derivative instruments. the corporation does not engage in
speculative derivative activities or derivative trading activities, nor does it
use derivatives with leveraged features. when the corporation does enter into
derivative transactions, it is to offset exposures associated with interest
rates, foreign currency exchange rates and hydrocarbon prices that arise from
existing assets, liabilities and forecasted transactions.
notes to consolidated financial statements
the gains and losses resulting from changes in the fair
value of derivatives are recorded in income. in some cases, the corporation
designates derivatives as fair value hedges, in which case the gains and losses
are offset in income by the gains and losses arising from changes in the fair
value of the underlying hedged item.
fair
value
fair value
is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a
liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. hierarchy
levels 1, 2 and 3 are terms for the priority of inputs to valuation techniques
used to measure fair value. hierarchy level1 inputs are quoted prices in
active markets for identical assets or liabilities. hierarchy level2
inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included within level1 that
are directly or indirectly observable for the asset or liability. hierarchy
level3 inputs are inputs that are not observable in the market.
inventories
crude oil,
products and merchandise inventories are carried at the lower of current market
value or cost (generally determined under the last-in, first-out method
lifo). inventory costs include expenditures and other charges (including
depreciation) directly and indirectly incurred in bringing the inventory to its
existing condition and location. selling expenses and general and
administrative expenses are reported as period costs and excluded from
inventory cost. inventories of materials and supplies are valued at cost or
less.
property,
plant and equipment
cost
basis. the corporation uses the
successful efforts method to account for its exploration and production
activities. under this method, costs are accumulated on a field-by-field basis.
costs incurred to purchase, lease, or otherwise acquire a property (whether
unproved or proved) are capitalized when incurred. exploratory well costs are
carried as an asset when the well has found a sufficient quantity of reserves
to justify its completion as a producing well and where the corporation is
making sufficient progress assessing the reserves and the economic and
operating viability of the project. exploratory well costs not meeting these
criteria are charged to expense. other exploratory expenditures, including
geophysical costs and annual lease rentals, are expensed as incurred.
development costs, including costs of productive wells and development dry
holes, are capitalized.
depreciation,
depletion and amortization. depreciation,
depletion and amortization are primarily determined under either the
unit-of-production method or the straight-line method, which is based on estimated
asset service life taking obsolescence into consideration.
acquisition
costs of proved properties are amortized using a unit-of-production method,
computed on the basis of total proved oil and gas reserves. capitalized
exploratory drilling and development costs associated with productive
depletable extractive properties are amortized using the unit-of-production
rates based on the amount of proved developed reserves of oil and gas that are
estimated to be recoverable from existing facilities using current operating
methods. under the unit-of-production method, oil and gas volumes are
considered produced once they have been measured through meters at custody
transfer or sales transaction points at the outlet valve on the lease or field
storage tank. in the event that the unit-of-production method does not result
in an equitable allocation of cost over the economic life of an upstream asset,
an alternative method is used. the straight-line method is used in limited
situations where the expected life of the asset does not reasonably correlate
with that of the underlying reserves. for example, certain assets used in the
production of oil and natural gas have a shorter life than the reserves, and as
such, the corporation uses straight-line depreciation to ensure the asset is
fully depreciated by the end of its useful life.
under the
sec definition of proved reserves, certain quantities of oil and natural gas
did not qualify as proved reserves at year-end 2016, the substantial majority
of which relates to the kearl oil sands operation, where no proved reserves
remain. to the extent that proved reserves for a property are entirely
de-booked and that property continues to produce, assets will be depreciated
using a unit-of-production method based on reserves determined at the most
recent sec price which results in a quantity of proved reserves greater than
zero, appropriately adjusted for production and technical changes.
investments
in refinery, chemical process, and lubes basestock manufacturing equipment are
generally depreciated on a straightline basis over a 25-year life.
service station buildings and fixed improvements generally are depreciated over
a 20-year life. maintenance and repairs, including planned major maintenance,
are expensed as incurred. major renewals and improvements are capitalized and
the assets replaced are retired.
notes to consolidated financial statements
impairment assessment. the corporation tests assets or groups of assets for
recoverability whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying
amounts may not be recoverable. among the events or changes in circumstances
which could indicate that the carrying value of an asset or asset group may not
be recoverable are the following:
a significant decrease in the
market price of a long-lived asset;
a significant adverse change in
the extent or manner in which an asset is being used or in its physical
condition including a significant decrease in current and projected reserve
volumes;
a significant adverse change in
legal factors or in the business climate that could affect the value, including
an adverse action or assessment by a regulator;
an accumulation of project costs
significantly in excess of the amount originally expected;
a current-period operating loss
combined with a history and forecast of operating or cash flow losses; and
a current expectation that, more
likely than not, a long-lived asset will be sold or otherwise disposed of
significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life.
the
corporation performs asset valuation analyses on an ongoing basis as a part of
its asset management program. these analyses and other profitability reviews
assist the corporation in assessing whether the carrying amounts of any of its
assets may not be recoverable.
in general,
the corporation does not view temporarily low prices or margins as an
indication of impairment. management does not believe that lower prices are
sustainable if energy is to be delivered with supply security to meet global
demand over the long term. although prices will occasionally drop significantly,
industry prices over the long term will continue to be driven by market supply
and demand. on the supply side, industry production from mature fields is
declining, but this is being offset by production from new discoveries and
field developments. opec production policies also have an impact on world oil
supplies. the demand side is largely a function of global economic growth.
because the lifespans of the vast majority of the corporations major assets
are measured in decades, the value of these assets is predominantly based on
long-term views of future commodity prices and production costs. during the
lifespan of these major assets, the corporation expects that oil and gas prices
will experience significant volatility, and consequently these assets will
experience periods of higher earnings and periods of lower earnings, or even
losses. in assessing whether the events or changes in circumstances indicate
the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable, the corporation
considers recent periods of operating losses in the context of its longer-term
view of prices. while near-term prices are subject to wide fluctuations, longer
term price views are more stable and meaningful for purposes of assessing
future cash flows.
when the
industry experiences a prolonged and deep reduction in commodity prices, the
market supply and demand conditions may result in changes to the corporations
long-term price or margin assumptions it uses for its capital investment
decisions. to the extent those changes result in a significant reduction in the
mid-point of its long-term oil, natural gas price or margin ranges, the
corporation may consider that situation, in conjunction with other events and
changes in circumstances such as a history of operating losses, an indicator of
potential impairment for certain assets.
in the
upstream, the standardized measure of discounted cash flows included in the
supplemental information on oil and gas exploration and production activities
is required to use prices based on the average of first-of-month prices. these
prices represent discrete points in time and could be higher or lower than the
corporations long-term price assumptions which are used for impairment
assessments. the corporation believes the standardized measure does not provide
a reliable estimate of the expected future cash flows to be obtained from the
development and production of its oil and gas properties or of the value of its
oil and gas reserves and therefore does not consider it relevant in determining
whether events or changes in circumstances indicate the need for an impairment
assessment.
if events or
circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable, the
corporation estimates the future undiscounted cash flows of the affected
properties to judge the recoverability of carrying amounts. in performing this
assessment, assets are grouped at the lowest level for which there are
identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other
groups of assets. cash flows used in recoverability assessments are based on
the corporations assumptions which are developed in the annual planning and
budgeting process, and are consistent with the criteria management uses to
evaluate investment opportunities. these evaluations make use of the
corporations assumptions of future crude oil and natural gas commodity prices,
refining and chemical margins, volumes, costs, and foreign currency exchange
rates. volumes are based on projected field and facility production profiles,
throughput, or sales. where unproved reserves exist, an appropriately
risk-adjusted amount of these reserves may be included in the evaluation. cash
flow estimates for impairment testing exclude the effects of derivative
instruments.
an asset
group is impaired if its undiscounted cash flows are less than the assets
carrying value. impairments are measured by the amount by which the carrying
value exceeds fair value. fair value is based on market prices if an active
market exists for the asset group, or discounted cash flows using a discount
rate commensurate with the risk. significant unproved properties are assessed
for impairment individually, and valuation allowances against the capitalized
costs are recorded based on the estimated
notes to consolidated financial statements
economic
chance of success and the length of time that the corporation expects to hold
the properties. properties that are not individually significant are aggregated
by groups and amortized based on development risk and average holding period.
other. gains on sales of proved and unproved properties are
only recognized when there is neither uncertainty about the recovery of costs
applicable to any interest retained nor any substantial obligation for future
performance by the corporation. losses on properties sold are recognized when
incurred or when the properties are held for sale and the fair value of the
properties is less than the carrying value.
interest
costs incurred to finance expenditures during the construction phase of
multiyear projects are capitalized as part of the historical cost of acquiring
the constructed assets. the project construction phase commences with the
development of the detailed engineering design and ends when the constructed
assets are ready for their intended use. capitalized interest costs are
included in property, plant and equipment and are depreciated over the service
life of the related assets.
asset
retirement obligations and environmental liabilities
thecorporation
incurs retirement obligations for certain assets. the fair values of these
obligations are recorded as liabilities on a discounted basis, which is
typically at the time the assets are installed. the costs associated with these
liabilities are capitalized as part of the related assets and depreciated. over
time, the liabilities are accreted for the change in their present value.
liabilities
for environmental costs are recorded when it is probable that obligations have
been incurred and the amounts can be reasonably estimated. these liabilities
are not reduced by possible recoveries from third parties, and projected cash
expenditures are not discounted.
foreign
currency translation
the
corporation selects the functional reporting currency for its international
subsidiaries based on the currency of the primary economic environment in which
each subsidiary operates.
downstream
and chemical operations primarily use the local currency. however, the u.s.
dollar is used in countries with a history of high inflation (primarily in
latin america) and singapore, which predominantly sells into the u.s. dollar
export market. upstream operations which are relatively self-contained and
integrated within a particular country, such as canada, the united kingdom,
norway and continental europe, use the local currency. some upstream
operations, primarily in asia and africa, use the u.s. dollar because they
predominantly sell crude and natural gas production into u.s.
dollar-denominated markets.
for all
operations, gains or losses from remeasuring foreign currency transactions into
the functional currency are included in income.
stock-based
payments
the
corporation awards stock-based compensation to employees in the form of
restricted stock and restricted stock units. compensation expense is measured
by the price of the stock at the date of grant and is recognized in income over
the requisite service period.
notes to consolidated financial statements
2. accounting changes
in
may 2014, the financial accounting standards board issued a new standard, revenue
from contracts with customers. the standard establishes a single revenue
recognition model for all contracts with customers, eliminates industry
specific requirements, and expands disclosure requirements. the standard is
required to be adopted beginning january 1, 2018. sales and other operating
revenue on the consolidated statement of income includes sales, excise and
value-added taxes on sales transactions. when the corporation adopts the
standard, revenue will exclude sales-based taxes collected on behalf of third
parties. this change in reporting will not impact earnings. the corporation
expects to adopt the standard using the modified retrospective method, under
which prior years results are not restated, but supplemental information on
the impact of the new standard is provided for 2018 results. the corporation
continues to evaluate other areas of the standard which are not expected to
have a material effect on the corporations financial statements.
in
february 2016, the financial accounting standards board issued a new standard, leases.
the standard requires that all leases with an initial term greater than one
year be recorded on the balance sheet as a lease asset and a lease liability.
the standard is required to be adopted beginning january 1, 2019, with early
adoption permitted. exxonmobil is evaluating the standard and its effect on the
corporations financial statements and plans to adopt it in 2019.
effective september 30, 2016, the
corporation early-adopted accounting standard update no. 2015-17 income
taxes (topic 740): balance sheet classification of deferred taxes on a
prospective basis. this update eliminates the requirement to classify deferred
tax assets and liabilities as current and noncurrent, and instead requires all
deferred tax assets and liabilities to be classified as noncurrent. see note 19.

5. cash flow information
the
consolidated statement of cash flows provides information about changes in cash
and cash equivalents. highly liquid investments with maturities of three months
or less when acquired are classified as cash equivalents.
for
2016, the net (gain) on asset sales on the consolidated statement of cash
flows includes before-tax amounts from the sale of service stations in canada,
the sale of upstream properties in the u.s., and the sale of aviation fueling
operations across multiple countries. for 2015, the number includes before-tax
amounts from the sale of service stations in europe, the sale of upstream
properties in the u.s., the sale of exxonmobils interests in chemical and
refining joint ventures, and the sale of the torrance refinery. for 2014, the number
includes before-tax gains from the sale of hong kong power operations,
additional proceeds related to the 2013 sale of a partial interest in iraq, the
sale of downstream affiliates in the caribbean and the sale or exchange of
upstream properties in the u.s., canada, and malaysia. these net gains are
reported in other income on the consolidated statement of income.
in
2016, the additions/(reductions) in commercial paper, and debt with three
months or less maturity on the consolidated statement of cash flows includes a
net $608 million addition of commercial paper with maturity over three months.
the gross amount issued was $3.9 billion, while the gross amount repaid was $3.3
billion. in 2015, the number includes a net $358 million addition of commercial
paper with maturity over three months. the gross amount issued was $8.1
billion, while the gross amount repaid was $7.7 billion.
in
2015, exxonmobil completed an asset exchange that resulted in value received of
approximately $500 million including $100million in cash. the non-cash
portion was not included in the sales of subsidiaries, investments, and
property, plant and equipment or the all other items-net lines on the
statement of cash flows. capital leases of approximately $1 billion were not
included in the additions to long-term debt or additions to property, plant and
equipment lines on the statement of cash flows.
in
2014, exxonmobil completed asset exchanges, primarily non-cash transactions, of
approximately $1.2 billion. this amount is not included in the sales of
subsidiaries, investments, and property, plant and equipment or the additions
to property, plant and equipment lines on the statement of cash flows.

the corporation has short-term committed
lines of credit of $5.5 billion which were unused as of december 31, 2016. these
lines are available for general corporate purposes.
the
weighted-average interest rate on short-term borrowings outstanding was 0.6 percent
and 0.4 percent at december31, 2016, and 2015, respectively.
notes to consolidated financial statements
7. equity company information
the
summarized financial information below includes amounts related to certain
less-than-majority-owned companies and majority-owned subsidiaries where
minority shareholders possess the right to participate in significant
management decisions (see note 1). these companies are primarily engaged in oil
and gas exploration and production, and natural gas marketing in north america;
natural gas exploration, production and distribution in europe; and exploration,
production, liquefied natural gas (lng) operations, refining operations,
petrochemical manufacturing, and fuel sales in asia and the middle east. also
included are several refining, petrochemical manufacturing, and marketing
ventures.
thecorporations
ownership in these ventures is in the form of shares in corporate joint
ventures as well as interests in partnerships. differences between the
companys carrying value of an equity investment and its underlying equity in
the net assets of the affiliate are assigned to the extent practicable to
specific assets and liabilities based on the companys analysis of the factors
giving rise to the difference. the amortization of this difference, as
appropriate, is included in income from equity affiliates.
the
shareof total equity company revenues from sales to exxonmobil
consolidated companies was 14 percent, 15 percent and 14percent in the
years 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
in
2013 and 2014, the corporation and rosneft established various entities to
conduct exploration and research activities. periods of disproportionate
funding will result in the corporation recognizing, during the early phases of
the projects, an investment that is larger than its equity share in these
entities. these joint ventures are considered variable interest entities. however,
since the corporation is not the primary beneficiary of these entities, the
joint ventures are reported as equity companies. in 2014, the european union
and united states imposed sanctions relating to the russian energy sector. with
respect to the foregoing, each joint venture continues to comply with all applicable
laws, rules, and regulations. the corporation's maximum before-tax exposure to
loss from these joint ventures as of december 31, 2016, is $1.0 billion.

and natural gas prices developed as part of its annual planning and budgeting
cycle led the corporation to conclude that the facts and circumstances
supported performing an impairment assessment of certain long-lived assets,
notably north america natural gas assets and certain other assets across the
remainder of its upstream operations. the assessment reflected long-term crude
and natural gas prices which are consistent with the mid-point of the ranges
that management uses to evaluate investment opportunities and which are in the
range of long-term price forecasts published by third-party industry experts
and government agencies. this assessment indicated that the vast majority of
asset groups have future undiscounted cash flow estimates exceeding carrying
values. however, the carrying values for certain asset groups in the united
states exceeded the estimated cash flows. as a result, the corporations fourth
quarter 2016 results include a before-tax charge of $3.3 billion to reduce the
carrying value of those assets to fair value. the asset groups subject to this
impairment charge are primarily dry gas operations in the rocky mountains
region of the united states with large undeveloped acreage positions. the
impairment charge is recognized in the line depreciation and depletion on the
consolidated statement of income and recorded in accumulated depreciation and
depletion.
the assessment of fair values required the
use of level 3 inputs. the principal parameters used to establish fair values
included estimates of both proved and unproved reserves, future commodity
prices which were consistent with the average of third-party industry experts
and government agencies, drilling and development costs, discount rates ranging
from 5.5 percent to 8 percent depending on the characteristics of the asset
group, and comparable market transactions. due to the inherent difficulty in
predicting future commodity prices, and the relationship between industry
prices and costs, it is not practicable to reasonably estimate the existence or
range of any potential future impairment charges related to the corporations
long-lived assets.
accumulated
depreciation and depletion totaled $209,691 million at the end of 2016 and $195,732
million at the end of 2015. interest capitalized in 2016, 2015 and 2014 was $708
million, $482 million and $344 million, respectively.
notes to consolidated financial statements
asset retirement obligations
the
corporation incurs retirement obligations for certain assets. the fair values
of these obligations are recorded as liabilities on a discounted basis, which
is typically at the time the assets are installed. in the estimation of fair
value, the corporation uses assumptions and judgments regarding such factors as
the existence of a legal obligation for an asset retirement obligation;
technical assessments of the assets; estimated amounts and timing of
settlements; discount rates; and inflation rates. asset retirement obligations
incurred in the current period were level 3 fair value measurements. the costs
associated with these liabilities are capitalized as part of the related assets
and depreciated as the reserves are produced. over time, the liabilities are
accreted for the change in their present value.
asset
retirement obligations for downstream and chemical facilities generally become
firm at the time the facilities are permanently shut down and dismantled. these
obligations may include the costs of asset disposal and additional soil remediation.
however, these sites have indeterminate lives based on plans for continued
operations and as such, the fair value of the conditional legal obligations
cannot be measured, since it is impossible to estimate the future settlement
dates of such obligations.

10. accounting for suspended exploratory
well costs
the
corporation continues capitalization of exploratory well costs whenthe
well has found a sufficient quantity of reserves to justify its completion as a
producing well and the corporationis making sufficient progress assessing
the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project. the term
project as used in this report can refer to a variety of different activities
and does not necessarily have the same meaning as in any government payment
transparency reports.
the
following two tables provide details of the changes in the balance of suspended
exploratory well costs as well as an aging summary of those costs.

13. financial instruments and derivatives
financial instruments. the fair value of financial instruments
is determined by reference to observable market data and other valuation
techniques as appropriate. the only category of financial instruments where the
difference between fair value and recorded book value is notable is long-term
debt. the estimated fair value of total long-term debt, excluding capitalized
lease obligations, was $28.0 billion and $18.9 billion at december 31, 2016,
and 2015, respectively, as compared to recorded book values of $27.7 billion
and $18.7 billion at december 31, 2016, and 2015, respectively. the increase in
the estimated fair value and book value of long-term debt reflects the corporations
issuance of $12.0 billion of long-term debt in the first quarter of 2016.
the fair value of long-term debt by
hierarchy level at december 31, 2016, is: level 1 $27,825 million; level 2 $137
million; and level 3 $6 million.
derivative instruments. the corporations size, strong capital
structure, geographic diversity and the complementary nature of the upstream,
downstream and chemical businesses reduce the corporations enterprise-wide
risk from changes in interest rates, currency rates and commodity prices. as a
result, the corporation makes limited use of derivatives to mitigate the impact
of such changes. the corporation does not engage in speculative derivative
activities or derivative trading activities nor does it use derivatives with
leveraged features. when the corporation does enter into derivative
transactions, it is to offset exposures associated with interest rates, foreign
currency exchange rates and hydrocarbon prices that arise from existing assets,
liabilities and forecasted transactions.
the
estimated fair value of derivative instruments outstanding and recorded on the
balance sheet was a net liability of $22 million at year-end 2016 and a net asset
of $21 million at year-end 2015. assets and liabilities associated with
derivatives are usually recorded either in other current assets or accounts payable
and accrued liabilities.
the
corporations fair value measurement of its derivative instruments use either
level 1 or level 2 inputs.
the
corporation recognized a before-tax gain or (loss) related to derivative
instruments of $(81) million, $39 million and $110million during 2016,
2015 and 2014, respectively. income statement effects associated with
derivatives are usually recorded either in sales and other operating revenue
or crude oil and product purchases.
the
corporation believes there are no material market or credit risks to the
corporations financial position, results of operations or liquidity as a
result of the derivative activities described above.
notes to consolidated financial statements
14. long-term debt
at
december31, 2016, long-term debt consisted of $28,257 million due
inu.s. dollars and $675 million representing the u.s. dollar equivalent
at year-end exchange rates of amounts payable in foreign currencies. these
amounts exclude that portion of long-term debt, totaling $2,960 million, which
matures within one year and is included in current liabilities. the increase in
the book value of long-term debt reflects the corporations issuance of $12.0
billion of longterm debt in the first quarter of 2016. the amounts of
long-term debt, including capitalized lease obligations, maturing in each of
the four years after december31, 2017, in millions of dollars, are: 2018
$4,737; 2019$3,886; 2020$1,609; and 2021$2,540.
at december 31, 2016, the corporations unused long-term credit lines were $0.3
billion.

15. incentive program
the 2003 incentive program provides for grants of stock
options, stock appreciation rights (sars), restricted stock and other forms of
award. awards may be granted to eligible employees of the corporation and those
affiliates at least 50 percent owned. outstanding awards are subject to certain
forfeiture provisions contained in the program or award instrument. options and
sars may be granted at prices not less than 100 percent of market value on the
date of grant and have a maximum life of 10 years. the maximum number of shares
of stock that may be issued under the 2003 incentive program is 220 million.
awards that are forfeited, expire or are settled in cash, do not count against
this maximum limit. the 2003 incentive program does not have a specified term.
new awards may be made until the available shares are depleted, unless the
board terminates the plan early. at the end of 2016, remaining shares available
for award under the 2003 incentive program were 93 million.
restricted
stock and restricted stock units. awards totaling 9,583 thousand, 9,681 thousand, and 9,775 thousand
of restricted (nonvested) common stock units were granted in 2016, 2015 and 2014,
respectively. compensation expense for these awards is based on the price of
the stock at the date of grant and is recognized in income over the requisite
service period. shares for these awards are issued to employees from treasury
stock. the units that are settled in cash are recorded as liabilities and their
changes in fair value are recognized over the vesting period. during the
applicable restricted periods, the shares and units may not be sold or
transferred and are subject to forfeiture. the majority of the awards have
graded vesting periods, with 50 percent of the shares and units in each award
vesting after three years and the remaining 50 percent vesting after seven
years. awards granted to a small number of senior executives have vesting
periods of five years for 50 percent of the award and of 10 years or
retirement, whichever occurs later, for the remaining 50 percent of the award.
the
corporation has purchased shares in the open market and through negotiated
transactions to offset shares or units settled in shares issued in conjunction
with benefit plans and programs. purchases may be discontinued at any time
without prior notice.

2015 and 2014, respectively.
notes to consolidated financial statements
16. litigation and other contingencies
litigation.
a variety of claims have
been made against exxonmobil and certain of its consolidated subsidiaries in a
number of pending lawsuits. management has regular litigation reviews,
including updates from corporate and outside counsel, to assess the need for accounting
recognition or disclosure of these contingencies. the corporation accrues an
undiscounted liability for those contingencies where the incurrence of a loss
is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. if a range of amounts
can be reasonably estimated and no amount within the range is a better estimate
than any other amount, then the minimum of the range is accrued. the
corporation does not record liabilities when the likelihood that the liability
has been incurred is probable but the amount cannot be reasonably estimated or
when the liability is believed to be only reasonably possible or remote. for
contingencies where an unfavorable outcome is reasonably possible and which are
significant, the corporation discloses the nature of the contingency and, where
feasible, an estimate of the possible loss. for purposes of our contingency
disclosures, significant includes material matters, as well as other matters,
which management believes should be disclosed. exxonmobil will continue to
defend itself vigorously in these matters. based on a consideration of all
relevant facts and circumstances, the corporation does not believe the ultimate
outcome of any currently pending lawsuit against exxonmobil will have a
material adverse effect upon the corporations operations, financial condition,
or financial statements taken as a whole.
other contingencies. the corporation and certain of its
consolidated subsidiaries were contingently liable at december31,2016,
for guarantees relating to notes, loans and performance under contracts. where
guarantees for environmental remediation and other similar matters do not
include a stated cap, the amounts reflect managements estimate of the maximum
potential exposure.

additionally, the corporation and its affiliates have numerous
long-term sales and purchase commitments in their various business activities,
all of which are expected to be fulfilled with no adverse consequences material
to the corporations operations or financial condition.
in accordance with a nationalization
decree issued by venezuelas president in february 2007, by may 1, 2007, a
subsidiary of the venezuelan national oil company (pdvsa) assumed the
operatorship of the cerro negro heavy oil project. this project had been
operated and owned by exxonmobil affiliates holding a 41.67 percent ownership
interest in the project. the decree also required conversion of the cerro negro
project into a mixed enterprise and an increase in pdvsas or one of its
affiliates ownership interest in the project, with the stipulation that if
exxonmobil refused to accept the terms for the formation of the mixed
enterprise within a specified period of time, the government would directly
assume the activities carried out by the joint venture. exxonmobil refused to
accede to the terms proffered by the government, and on june 27, 2007, the
government expropriated exxonmobils 41.67 percent interest in the cerro negro
project.
on september 6, 2007, affiliates of
exxonmobil filed a request for arbitration with the international centre for
settlement of investment disputes (icsid). the icsid tribunal issued a decision
on june 10, 2010, finding that it had jurisdiction to proceed on the basis of
the netherlands-venezuela bilateral investment treaty. on october 9, 2014, the
icsid tribunal issued its final award finding in favor of the exxonmobil
affiliates and awarding $1.6 billion as of the date of expropriation, june 27,
2007, and interest from that date at 3.25% compounded annually until the date
of payment in full. the tribunal also noted that one of the cerro negro project
agreements provides a mechanism to prevent double recovery between the icsid
award and all or part of an earlier award of $908 million to an exxonmobil
affiliate, mobil cerro negro, ltd., against pdvsa and a pdvsa affiliate, pdvsa
cn, in an arbitration under the rules of the international chamber of commerce.
on
june 12, 2015, the tribunal rejected in its entirety venezuelas october 23,
2014, application to revise the icsid award. the tribunal also lifted the
associated stay of enforcement that had been entered upon the filing of the
application to revise.
still
pending is venezuelas february 2, 2015, application to icsid seeking annulment
of the icsid award. that application alleges that, in issuing the icsid award,
the tribunal exceeded its powers, failed to state reasons on which the icsid
award was based, and departed from a fundamental rule of procedure. a separate
stay of the icsid award was entered following the filing of the annulment
application. on july 7, 2015, the icsid committee considering the annulment application
heard arguments from the parties on whether to lift the stay of the award
associated with that application. on july 28, 2015, the committee issued an
order that would lift the stay of enforcement unless, within 30 days, venezuela
delivered a commitment to pay the award if the
notes to consolidated financial statements
application
to annul is denied. on september 17, 2015, the committee ruled that venezuela
had complied with the requirement to submit a written commitment to pay the
award and so left the stay of enforcement in place. a hearing on venezuelas
application for annulment was held march 8-9, 2016.
the
united states district court for the southern district of new york entered
judgment on the icsid award on october 10, 2014. motions filed by venezuela to
vacate that judgment on procedural grounds and to modify the judgment by
reducing the rate of interest to be paid on the icsid award from the entry of
the courts judgment, until the date of payment, were denied on february13,
2015, and march 4, 2015, respectively. on march 9, 2015, venezuela filed a notice
of appeal of the courts actions on the two motions. oral arguments on this
appeal were held before the united states court of appeals for the second
circuit on january 7, 2016.
the
district courts judgment on the icsid award is currently stayed until such
time as icsids stay of the award entered following venezuelas filing of its
application to annul has been lifted. the net impact of these matters on the
corporations consolidated financial results cannot be reasonably estimated.
regardless, the corporation does not expect the resolution to have a material
effect upon the corporations operations or financial condition.
an affiliate of exxonmobil is one of the contractors under
a production sharing contract (psc) with the nigerian national petroleum
corporation (nnpc) covering the erha block located in the offshore waters of
nigeria. exxonmobil's affiliate is the operator of the block and owns a 56.25
percent interest under the psc. the contractors are in dispute with nnpc
regarding nnpc's lifting of crude oil in excess of its entitlement under the
terms of the psc. in accordance with the terms of the psc, the contractors
initiated arbitration in abuja, nigeria, under the nigerian arbitration and
conciliation act. on october 24, 2011, a three-member arbitral tribunal issued
an award upholding the contractors' position in all material respects and
awarding damages to the contractors jointly in an amount of approximately $1.8
billion plus $234 million in accrued interest. the contractors petitioned a
nigerian federal court for enforcement of the award, and nnpc petitioned the
same court to have the award set aside. on may 22, 2012, the court set aside
the award. the contractors appealed that judgment to the court of appeal, abuja
judicial division. on july 22, 2016, the court of appeal upheld the decision of
the lower court setting aside the award. on october 21, 2016, the contractors
appealed the decision to the supreme court of nigeria. in june 2013, the
contractors filed a lawsuit against nnpc in the nigerian federal high court in
order to preserve their ability to seek enforcement of the psc in the courts if
necessary. in october 2014, the contractors filed suit in the united states
district court for the southern district of new york to enforce, if necessary,
the arbitration award against nnpc assets residing within that jurisdiction.
nnpc has moved to dismiss the lawsuit. the stay in the proceedings in the
southern district of new york has been lifted. at this time, the net impact of
this matter on the corporation's consolidated financial results cannot be
reasonably estimated. however, regardless of the outcome of enforcement
proceedings, the corporation does not expect the proceedings to have a material
effect upon the corporation's operations or financial condition.

payments for funded and unfunded plans.
(2) for 2016 and 2015, other postretirement benefits paid are
net of $22 million and $15 million of medicare subsidy receipts, respectively.
for selection of the discount rate for
u.s. plans, several sources of information are considered, including interest
rate market indicators and the discount rate determined by use of a yield curve
based on high-quality, noncallable bonds with cash flows that match estimated
outflows for benefit payments. for major non-u.s. plans, the discount rate is
determined by using bond portfolios with an average maturity approximating that
of the liabilities or spot yield curves, both of which areconstructed
using high-quality, local-currency-denominated bonds.
the measurement of the accumulated
postretirement benefit obligation assumes a health care cost trend rate of 4.5
percent in 2018 and subsequent years. a one-percentage-point increase in the health
care cost trend rate would increase service and interest cost by $76 million
and the postretirement benefit obligation by $862 million. a
one-percentage-point decrease in the health care cost trend rate would decrease
service and interest cost by $58 million and the postretirement benefit
obligation by $687 million.

notes to consolidated financial statements
the funding levels of all qualified
pension plans are in compliance withstandards set by applicable law or
regulation. as shown in the table below, certain smaller u.s. pension plans and
a number of non-u.s. pension plans are not funded because local applicable tax rules
andregulatory practices do not encourage funding of these plans. all
defined benefit pension obligations, regardless of the funding status
ofthe underlying plans, are fully supported by the financial strength
ofthe corporation or the respective sponsoring affiliate.

the authoritative guidance for defined
benefit pension and other postretirement plans requires an employer to
recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of a defined benefit
postretirement plan as an asset or liability in its statement of financial position
and to recognize changes in that funded status in the year in which the changes
occur through other comprehensive income.

notes to consolidated financial statements
the long-term
expected rate of return on funded assets shown below is established for each
benefit plan by developing a forwardlooking, long-term return assumption
for each asset class, taking into account factorssuch as the expected
real return for the specific asset class and inflation. a single, long-term
rate of return is then calculated as the weighted average of the target asset
allocation percentages and the long-term return assumption for each asset
class.

the corporations investment strategy for
benefit plan assets reflects along-term view, a careful assessment of the
risks inherent in various asset classes and broad diversification to reduce the
risk of the portfolio. the benefit plan assets are primarily invested in
passive equity and fixedincome index funds to diversify risk while
minimizing costs. the equity funds hold exxonmobil stock only to the extent
necessary to replicate the relevant equity index. the fixed income funds are
largely invested in high-quality corporate and government debt securities.
studies
are periodically conducted to establish the preferred target asset allocation
percentages. the target asset allocation for the u.s. benefit plans and the major
non-u.s. plans is 40 percent equity securities and 60 percent debt securities.
the equity targets for the u.s. and non-u.s. plans include an allocation to
private equity partnerships that primarily focus on early-stage venture capital
of 5 percent and 3 percent, respectively.
the
fair value measurement levels are accounting terms that refer to different
methods of valuing assets. the terms do not represent the relative risk or
credit quality of an investment.

18. disclosures about segments and related
information
the
upstream, downstream and chemical functions best define the operating segments
of the business that are reported separately. the factors used to identify
these reportable segments are based on the nature of the operations that are
undertaken by each segment. the upstream segment is organized and operates to
explore for and produce crude oil and natural gas. the downstream segment is
organized and operates to manufacture and sell petroleum products. the chemical
segment is organized and operates to manufacture and sell petrochemicals. these
segments are broadly understood across the petroleum and petrochemical
industries.
these
functions have been defined as the operating segments of the corporation
because they are the segments (1)that engage in business activities from
which revenues are earned and expenses are incurred; (2)whose operating
results are regularly reviewed by the corporations chief operating decision
maker to make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segment and to
assess its performance; and (3)for which discrete financial information
is available.
earnings
after income tax include transfers at estimated market prices.
notes to consolidated financial statements
in corporate and financing activities,
interest revenue relates to interest earned on cash deposits and marketablesecurities.
interestexpense includes non-debt-related interest expense of $63 million

(1) in 2014, state taxes included a favorable adjustment of
deferred taxes of approximately $830 million.
all other taxes and duties include taxes
reported in production and manufacturing and selling, general and
administrative (sg&a) expenses. the above provisions for deferred income
taxes include net charges of $180 million in 2016 and $177 million in 2015 and
a net credit of $40 million in 2014 for the effect of changes in tax laws and
rates.

of temporary differences between the amount of assets and liabilities
recognized for financial reporting purposes and such amounts recognized for tax
purposes.

and effects of foreign currency translation of $41 million.
deferred
income tax (assets) and liabilities are included in the balance sheet as shown
below. effective september 30, 2016, the corporation early-adopted accounting
standard update no. 2015-17 income taxes (topic 740): balance sheet
classification of deferred taxes on a prospective basis. this update
eliminates the requirement to classify deferred tax assets and liabilities as
current and noncurrent, and instead requires all deferred tax assets and liabilities
to be classified as noncurrent.

the corporation had $54billion of
indefinitely reinvested, undistributed earnings from subsidiary companies
outside the u.s. that were retained to fund prior and future capital project
expenditures. deferred taxes have not been recorded for potential future tax
obligations as these earnings are expected to be indefinitely reinvested for
the foreseeable future. as of december 31, 2016, it is not practical to
estimate the unrecognized deferred tax liability associated with these earnings
given the future availability of foreign tax credits and uncertainties about the
timing of potential remittances.
notes to consolidated financial statements
unrecognized tax benefits. the corporation is subject to income
taxation in many jurisdictions around the world. unrecognized tax benefits
reflect the difference between positions taken or expected to be taken on
income tax returns and the amounts recognized in the financial statements. the
following table summarizes the movement in unrecognized tax benefits:

the gross unrecognized tax benefit
balances shown above are predominantly related to tax positions that would
reduce the corporations effective tax rate if the positions are favorably
resolved. unfavorable resolution of these tax positions generally would not
increase the effective tax rate. the 2016, 2015 and 2014 changes in
unrecognized tax benefits did not have a material effect on the corporations
net income.
resolution
of these tax positions through negotiations with the relevant tax authorities
or through litigation will take many years to complete. it is difficult to
predict the timing of resolution for tax positions since such timing is not
entirely within the control of the corporation. in the united states, the
corporation has various ongoing u.s. federal income tax positions at issue with
the internal revenue service (irs) for tax years beginning in 2006. the irs has
asserted penalties associated with several of those positions. the corporation
has not recognized the penalties as an expense because the corporation does not
expect the penalties to be sustained under applicable law. the corporation has
filed a refund suit for tax years 2006-2009 in a u.s. federal district court
with respect to the positions at issue for those years. unfavorable resolution
of all positions at issue with the irs would not have a materially adverse
effect on the corporations net income or liquidity.
it
is reasonably possible that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits could
change in the next 12 months in a range from a decrease of 10 percent to an increase
of up to 15 percent, with no material impact on the corporations net income.
the following table summarizes the tax years that remain

the corporation classifies interest on
income tax-related balances as interest expense or interest income and
classifies tax-related penalties as operating expense.
the
corporation incurred $4 million, $39 million and $42 million in interest
expense on income tax reserves in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. the
related interest payable balances were $191 million and $223 million at
december31, 2016, and 2015, respectively.
notes to consolidated financial statements
20. subsequent
events
the corporation
completed the acquisition of interoil corporation (ioc) for about $2.5 billion
on february 22, 2017. ioc is an exploration and production business focused on
papua new guinea. consideration includes around 28 million shares of exxon
mobil corporation common stock with an estimated value of $2.3 billion, a
contingent resource payment (crp) and cash. the crp provides ioc shareholders
$7.07 per share in cash for each incremental certified trillion cubic feet
equivalent (tcfe) of resources above 6.2 tcfe, and up to 11.0 tcfe. iocs
assets include a receivable related to the same resource base for volumes in
excess of 3.5 tcfe at amounts ranging from $0.24 - $0.40 per thousand cubic
feet equivalent. the receivable is expected to more than cover the crp.
on january 16, 2017, an affiliate of the
corporation entered into a purchase and sale agreement with the bass family of
fort worth, texas, to acquire companies that indirectly own certain oil and gas
properties in the permian basin and certain additional properties and related
assets in exchange for shares of exxon mobil corporation common stock having an
aggregate value at the time of closing of $5.6 billion, together with
additional contingent cash payments tied to future drilling and completion
activities (up to a maximum of $1.02 billion). the transaction is currently
expected to close on or about february 28, 2017. as of january16,2017,
the number of shares issuable in connection with the transaction would have
been approximately 63 million.

the amounts shown for net capitalized costs of consolidated
subsidiaries are $15,239 million less at year-end 2016 and $14,685million
less at year-end 2015 than the amounts reported as investments in property,
plant and equipment for the upstream in note9. this is due tothe
exclusion from capitalized costs of certain transportation and research assets
and assets relating to lng operations. assets related tooil sands and oil
shale mining operations are included in the capitalized costs in accordance
with financial accounting standards board rules.

the
amounts reported as costs incurred include both capitalized costs and costs
charged to expense during the year. costs incurred also include new asset
retirement obligations established in the current year, as well as increases or
decreases to the asset retirement obligation resulting from changes in cost
estimates or abandonment date. total consolidated costs incurred in 2016 were $11,375million,
down $10,512 million from 2015, due primarily to lower development costs. in 2015
costs were $21,887 million, down $7,228 million from 2014, due primarily to lower
development costs and property acquisition costs. total equity company costs
incurred in 2016 were $1,406 million, down $58 million from 2015, due primarily
to lower development costs.

oil and
gas reserves
the following information describes changes during the
years and balances of proved oil and gas reserves at year-end 2014, 2015, and
2016.
the
definitions used are in accordance with the securities and exchange
commissions rule 4-10 (a)of regulation s-x.
proved
oil and natural gas reserves are those quantities of oil and natural gas,
which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with
reasonable certainty to be economically producible  from a given date forward,
from known reservoirs, and under existing economic conditions, operating
methods and government regulations  prior to the time at which contracts
providing the right to operate expire, unless evidence indicates that renewal
is reasonably certain. in some cases, substantial new investments in additional
wells and related facilities will be required to recover these proved reserves.
in
accordance with the securities and exchange commissions (sec) rules, the
corporations year-end reserves volumes as well as the reserves change
categories shown in the following tables are required to be calculated on the
basis of average prices during the 12-month period prior to the ending date of
the period covered by the report, determined as an unweighted arithmetic average
of the first-day-of-the-month price for each month within such period. these
reserves quantities are also used in calculating unitof-production
depreciation rates and in calculating the standardized measure of discounted
net cash flow.
revisions
can include upward or downward changes in previously estimated volumes of
proved reserves for existing fields due to the evaluation or re-evaluation of
(1)already available geologic, reservoir or production data, (2)new
geologic, reservoir or production data or (3)changes in the average of
first-of-month oil and natural gas prices and / or costs that are used in the
estimation of reserves. revisions can also result from significant changes in
either development strategy or production equipment/facility capacity. reserve
volumes that were subject to a downward revision can be revised upward at some
point in the future when price levels increase, costs decline, and / or
operating efficiencies occur.
as a
result of very low prices during 2016, under the sec definition of proved
reserves, certain quantities of oil and natural gas that qualified as proved
reserves in prior years did not qualify as proved reserves at yearend
2016 and are reflected as downward revisions. amounts no longer qualifying as
proved reserves include the entire 3.5 billion barrels of bitumen at kearl. in
addition, 0.8 billion barrels of oil equivalent across the remainder of north
america no longer qualify as proved reserves mainly due to the acceleration of
the projected end-of-field-life. among the factors that would result in these amounts being
recognized again as proved reserves at some point in the future are a recovery
in average price levels, a further decline in costs, and / or operating
efficiencies. we do not
expect the downward revision of reported proved reserves under sec definitions
to affect the operation of the underlying projects or to alter our outlook for
future production volumes.
proved
reserves include 100 percent of each majority-owned affiliates participation
in proved reserves and exxonmobils ownership percentage of the proved reserves
of equity companies, but exclude royalties and quantities due others. natural gas
reserves exclude the gaseous equivalent of liquids expected to be removed from
the natural gas on leases, at field facilities and at gas processing plants.
these liquids are included in net proved reserves of crude oil and natural gas
liquids.
in
the proved reserves tables, consolidated reserves and equity company reserves
are reported separately. however, the corporation does not view equity company
reserves any differently than those from consolidated companies.
reserves
reported under production sharing and other nonconcessionary agreements are
based on the economic interest as defined by the specific fiscal terms in the
agreement. the production and reserves that we report for these types of
arrangements typically vary inversely with oil and natural gas price changes.
as oil and natural gas prices increase, the cash flow and value received by the
company increase; however, the production volumes and reserves required to
achieve this value will typically be lower because of the higher prices. when
prices decrease, the opposite effect generally occurs. the percentage of total
liquids and natural gas proved reserves (consolidated subsidiaries plus equity
companies) at year-end 2016 that were associated with production sharing
contract arrangements was 14 percent of liquids, 9 percent of natural gas and 12
percent on an oil-equivalent basis (natural gas converted to oil-equivalent at
6 billion cubic feet = 1million barrels).
net
proved developed reserves are those volumes that are expected to be recovered
through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods or in
which the cost of the required equipment is relatively minor compared to the
cost of a new well. net proved undeveloped reserves are those volumes that are
expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage, or from existing
wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion.
crude
oil and natural gas liquids and natural gas production quantities shown are the
net volumes withdrawn from exxonmobils oil and natural gas reserves. the
natural gas quantities differ from the quantities of natural gas delivered for
sale by the producing function as reported in the operating information due to
volumes consumed or flared and inventory changes.

standardized measure of discounted future cash flows
as required by the financial accounting
standards board, the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows
is computed by applying first-day-of-the-month average prices,
year-endcosts and legislated tax rates and a discount factor of 10 percent
tonet proved reserves. the standardized measure includes costs for
futuredismantlement, abandonment and rehabilitation obligations.
thecorporation believes the standardized measure does not provide
areliable estimate of the corporations expected future cash flows to be
obtained from the development and production of its oil and gas properties or
of the value of its proved oil and gas reserves. the standardized measure is
prepared on the basis of certain prescribed assumptions including first-day-of-the-month
average prices, which represent discrete points in time and therefore may cause
significant variability in cash flows from year to year as prices change.

securities and exchange
commission (sec) rules require the
corporations reserves to be calculated on the basis of average first-of-month
oil and natural gas prices during the reporting year. as a result of very low
prices during 2016, under the sec definition of proved reserves, certain
quantities of oil and natural gas that qualified as proved reserves in prior
years did not qualify as proved reserves at year-end 2016. future net cash
flows for these quantities are excluded from the 2016 standardized measure of discounted
future cash flows. substantially all of this reduction in discounted future net
cash flows since december 31, 2015, is reflected in the line net change in
prices, lifting and development costs in the table above.
