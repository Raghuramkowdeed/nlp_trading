business
exxon mobil corporation was incorporated in the state
of new jersey in 1882. divisions and affiliated companies of exxonmobil operate
or market products in the united states and most other countries of the world.
their principal business is energy, involving exploration for, and production
of, crude oil and natural gas, manufacture of petroleum products and
transportation and sale of crude oil, natural gas and petroleum products.
exxonmobil is a major manufacturer and marketer of commodity petrochemicals,
including olefins, aromatics, polyethylene and polypropylene plastics and a
wide variety of specialty products. exxonmobil also has interests in electric
power generation facilities. affiliates of exxonmobil conduct extensive
research programs in support of these businesses.
exxon mobil corporation has several divisions and
hundreds of affiliates, many with names that include exxonmobil, exxon,
esso, mobil or xto. for convenience and simplicity, in this
report the terms exxonmobil, exxon, esso, mobil and xto,
as well as terms like corporation, company, our, we
and its, are sometimes used as abbreviated references to specific
affiliates or groups of affiliates. the precise meaning depends on the context
in question.
throughout exxonmobils businesses, new and ongoing
measures are taken to prevent and minimize the impact of our operations on air,
water and ground. these include a significant investment in refining
infrastructure and technology to manufacture clean fuels as well as projects to
monitor and reduce nitrogen oxide, sulfur oxide, and greenhouse gas emissions
and expenditures for asset retirement obligations. using definitions and
guidelines established by the american petroleum institute, exxonmobils 2012
worldwide environmental expenditures for all such preventative and remediation
steps, including exxonmobils share of equity company expenditures, were $5.5billion,
of which $3.5billion were included in expenses with the remainder in
capital expenditures. the total cost for such activities is expected to have a
modest increase in 2013 and 2014 (with capital expenditures approximately 45
percent of the total).
the energy and petrochemical industries are highly
competitive. there is competition within the industries and also with other
industries in supplying the energy, fuel and chemical needs of both industrial
and individual consumers. the corporation competes with other firms in the sale
or purchase of needed goods and services in many national and international
markets and employs all methods of competition which are lawful and appropriate
for such purposes.
operating data and industry segment information for
the corporation are contained in the financial section of this report under the
following: quarterly information, note18: disclosures about segments
and related information and operating summary. information on oil and gas
reserves is contained in the oil and gas reserves part of the supplemental
information on oil and gas exploration and production activities portion of
the financial section of this report.
exxonmobil has a long-standing commitment to the
development of proprietary technology. we have a wide array of research
programs designed to meet the needs identified in each of our business
segments. information on company-sponsored research and development spending is
contained in note3: miscellaneous financial information of the
financial section of this report. exxonmobil held approximately 11 thousand
active patents worldwide at the end of 2012. for technology licensed to third
parties, revenues totaled approximately $176 million in 2012. although
technology is an important contributor to the overall operations and results of
our company, the profitability of each business segment is not dependent on any
individual patent, trade secret, trademark, license, franchise or concession.
the number of regular employees was 76.9 thousand, 82.1
thousand and 83.6 thousand at years ended 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
regular employees are defined as active executive, management, professional,
technical and wage employees who work full time or part time for the
corporation and are covered by the corporations benefit plans and programs.
regular employees do not include employees of the company-operated retail sites
(cors). the number of cors employees was 11.1 thousand, 17.0 thousand and 20.1
thousand at years ended 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
information concerning the source and availability of
raw materials used in the corporations business, the extent of seasonality in
the business, the possibility of renegotiation of profits or termination of
contracts at the election of governments and risks attendant to foreign
operations may be found in item 1arisk factors and item 2properties in
this report.
exxonmobil maintains a website at exxonmobil.com. our
annual report on form10-k, quarterly reports on form10-q, current
reports on form 8-k and any amendments to those reports filed or furnished
pursuant to section13(a) of the securities exchange act of 1934 are made
available through our website as soon as reasonably practical after we
electronically file or furnish the reports to the securities and exchange
commission. also available on the corporations website are the companys
corporate governance guidelines and code of ethics and business conduct, as
well as the charters of the audit, compensation and nominating committees of
the board of directors. information on our website is not incorporated into
this report.
item1a. risk factors
exxonmobils financial and operating
results are subject to a variety of risks inherent in the global oil, gas, and
petrochemical businesses. many of these risk factors are not within the
companys control and could adversely affect our business, our financial and
operating results or our financial condition. these risk factors include:
supply and demand
the oil, gas, and petrochemical businesses are
fundamentally commodity businesses. this means exxonmobils operations and
earnings may be significantly affected by changes in oil, gas and petrochemical
prices and by changes in margins on refined products. oil, gas, petrochemical
and product prices and margins in turn depend on local, regional and global
events or conditions that affect supply and demand for the relevant commodity.
economic conditions. the demand for energy and petrochemicals correlates closely with
general economic growth rates. the occurrence of recessions or other periods of
low or negative economic growth will typically have a direct adverse impact on
our results. other factors that affect general economic conditions in the world
or in a major region, such as changes in population growth rates, periods of
civil unrest, government austerity programs, or currency exchange rate
fluctuations, can also impact the demand for energy and petrochemicals.
sovereign debt downgrades, defaults, inability to access debt markets due to
credit or legal constraints, liquidity crises, the breakup or restructuring of
fiscal, monetary, or political systems such as the european union, and other
events or conditions that impair the functioning of financial markets and
institutions also pose risks to exxonmobil, including risks to the safety of
our financial assets and to the ability of our partners and customers to
fulfill their commitments to exxonmobil.
other demand-related factors. other factors that may affect the demand for oil, gas
and petrochemicals, and therefore impact our results, include technological
improvements in energy efficiency; seasonal weather patterns, which affect the
demand for energy associated with heating and cooling; increased
competitiveness of alternative energy sources that have so far generally not
been competitive with oil and gas without the benefit of government subsidies
or mandates; and changes in technology or consumer preferences that alter fuel
choices, such as toward alternative fueled vehicles.
other supply-related factors. commodity prices and margins also vary depending on a
number of factors affecting supply. for example, increased supply from the development
of new oil and gas supply sources and technologies to enhance recovery from
existing sources tend to reduce commodity prices to the extent such supply
increases are not offset by commensurate growth in demand. similarly, increases
in industry refining or petrochemical manufacturing capacity tend to reduce
margins on the affected products. world oil, gas, and petrochemical supply
levels can also be affected by factors that reduce available supplies, such as
adherence by member countries to opec production quotas and the occurrence of
wars, hostile actions, natural disasters, disruptions in competitors
operations, or unexpected unavailability of distribution channels that may
disrupt supplies. technological change can also alter the relative costs for
competitors to find, produce, and refine oil and gas and to manufacture
petrochemicals.
other market factors. exxonmobils business results are also exposed to
potential negative impacts due to changes in interest rates, inflation,
currency exchange rates, and other local or regional market conditions. we
generally do not use financial instruments to hedge market exposures.
government and political factors
exxonmobils results can be adversely affected by
political or regulatory developments affecting our operations.
access limitations. a number of countries limit access to their oil and gas resources, or
may place resources off-limits from development altogether. restrictions on
foreign investment in the oil and gas sector tend to increase in times of high
commodity prices, when national governments may have less need of outside
sources of private capital. many countries also restrict the import or export
of certain products based on point of origin.
restrictions on doing business. as a u.s. company, exxonmobil is subject to laws
prohibiting u.s. companies from doing business in certain countries, or
restricting the kind of business that may be conducted. such restrictions may
provide a competitive advantage to our non-u.s. competitors unless their own
home countries impose comparable restrictions.
lack of legal certainty. some countries in which we do business lack
well-developed legal systems, or have not yet adopted clear regulatory
frameworks for oil and gas development. lack of legal certainty exposes our
operations to increased risk of adverse or unpredictable actions by government
officials, and also makes it more difficult for us to enforce our contracts. in
some cases these risks can be partially offset by agreements to arbitrate
disputes in an international forum, but the adequacy of this remedy may still
depend on the local legal system to enforce an award.
regulatory and litigation risks.even in countries with well-developed legal
systems where exxonmobil does business, we remain exposed to changes in law
(including changes that result from international treaties and accords) that
could adversely affect our results, such as:
increases in taxes or government royalty rates
(including retroactive claims);
price controls;
changes in environmental regulations or other laws
that increase our cost of compliance or reduce or delay available business
opportunities (including changes in laws related to offshore drilling
operations, water use, or hydraulic fracturing);
adoption of regulations mandating the use of
alternative fuels or uncompetitive fuel components;
adoption of government payment transparency
regulations that could require us to disclose competitively sensitive
commercial information, or that could cause us to violate the non-disclosure
laws of other countries; and
government actions to cancel contracts,
re-denominate the official currency, renounce or default on obligations,
renegotiate terms unilaterally, or expropriate assets.
legal remedies available to compensate us for
expropriation or other takings may be inadequate.
we also may be adversely affected by the outcome of
litigation or other legal proceedings, especially in countries such as the
united states in which very large and unpredictable punitive damage awards may
occur.
security concerns. successful operation of particular facilities or projects may be
disrupted by civil unrest, acts of sabotage or terrorism, and other local
security concerns. such concerns may require us to incur greater costs for
security or to shut down operations for a period of time.
climate change and greenhouse gas restrictions. due to concern over the risk of climate change, a
number of countries have adopted, or are considering the adoption of,
regulatory frameworks to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. these include
adoption of cap and trade regimes, carbon taxes, restrictive permitting,
increased efficiency standards, and incentives or mandates for renewable
energy. these requirements could make our products more expensive, lengthen project
implementation times, and reduce demand for hydrocarbons, as well as shift
hydrocarbon demand toward relatively lower-carbon sources such as natural gas.
current and pending greenhouse gas regulations may also increase our compliance
costs, such as for monitoring or sequestering emissions.
government sponsorship of alternative energy. many governments are providing tax advantages and
other subsidies to support alternative energy sources or are mandating the use
of specific fuels or technologies. governments are also promoting research into
new technologies to reduce the cost and increase the scalability of alternative
energy sources. we are conducting our own research efforts into alternative
energy, such as through sponsorship of the global climate and energy project at
stanford university and research into fuel-producing algae. our future results
may depend in part on the success of our research efforts and on our ability to
adapt and apply the strengths of our current business model to providing the energy
products of the future in a cost-competitive manner. see management
effectiveness below.
management effectiveness
in addition to external economic and political
factors, our future business results also depend on our ability to manage
successfully those factors that are at least in part within our control. the
extent to which we manage these factors will impact our performance relative to
competition. for projects in which we are not the operator, we depend on the
management effectiveness of one or more co-venturers whom we do not control.
exploration and development program. our ability to maintain and grow our oil and gas
production depends on the success of our exploration and development efforts.
among other factors, we must continuously improve our ability to identify the
most promising resource prospects and apply our project management expertise to
bring discovered resources on line on schedule and within budget.
project management. the success of exxonmobils upstream, downstream, and chemical
businesses depends on complex, long-term, capital intensive projects. these
projects in turn require a high degree of project management expertise to
maximize efficiency. specific factors that can affect the performance of major
projects include our ability to: negotiate successfully with joint venturers,
partners, governments, suppliers, customers, or others; model and optimize
reservoir performance; develop markets for project outputs, whether through
long-term contracts or the development of effective spot markets; manage
changes in operating conditions and costs, including costs of third party
equipment or services such as drilling rigs and shipping; prevent, to the
extent possible, and respond effectively to unforeseen technical difficulties
that could delay project startup or cause unscheduled project downtime; and
influence the performance of project operators where exxonmobil does not
perform that role.
the term project as used in this report does not
necessarily have the same meaning as under sec rule 13q-1 relating to
government payment reporting. for example, a single project for purposes of
the rule may encompass numerous properties, agreements, investments,
developments, phases, work efforts, activities, and components, each of which we
may also informally describe as a project.
operational efficiency. an important component of exxonmobils competitive
performance, especially given the commodity-based nature of many of our
businesses, is our ability to operate efficiently, including our ability to
manage expenses and improve production yields on an ongoing basis. this
requires continuous management focus, including technology improvements, cost
control, productivity enhancements, regular reappraisal of our asset portfolio,
and the recruitment, development and retention of high caliber employees.
research and development. to maintain our competitive position, especially in
light of the technological nature of our businesses and the need for continuous
efficiency improvement, exxonmobils research and development organizations
must be successful and able to adapt to a changing market and policy
environment.
safety, business controls, and environmental risk
management. our results depend on
managements ability to minimize the inherent risks of oil, gas, and
petrochemical operations, to control effectively our business activities and to
minimize the potential for human error. we apply rigorous management systems
and continuous focus to workplace safety and to avoiding spills or other adverse
environmental events. for example, we work to minimize spills through a
combined program of effective operations integrity management, ongoing
upgrades, key equipment replacements, and comprehensive inspection and
surveillance. similarly, we are implementing cost-effective new technologies
and adopting new operating practices to reduce air emissions, not only in
response to government requirements but also to address community priorities.
we also maintain a disciplined framework of internal controls and apply a
controls management system for monitoring compliance with this framework.
substantial liabilities and other adverse impacts could result if our
management systems and controls do not function as intended. the ability to
insure against such risks is limited by the capacity of the applicable
insurance markets, which may not be sufficient.
business risks also include the risk of cybersecurity
breaches. if our systems for protecting against cybersecurity risks prove not
to be sufficient, exxonmobil could be adversely affected such as by having its
business systems compromised, its proprietary information altered, lost or
stolen, or its business operations disrupted.
preparedness.
our operations may be disrupted by severe weather events, natural disasters,
human error, and similar events. for example, hurricanes may damage our
offshore production facilities or coastal refining and petrochemical plants in
vulnerable areas. our ability to mitigate the adverse impacts of these events
depends in part upon the effectiveness of our rigorous disaster preparedness
and response planning, as well as business continuity planning.
projections, estimates and descriptions of
exxonmobils plans and objectives included or incorporated in items 1, 1a, 2, 7
and 7a of this report are forward-looking statements. actual future results,
including project completion dates, production rates, capital expenditures,
costs and business plans could differ materially due to, among other things,
the factors discussed above and elsewhere in this report.

(1) south america includes proved
developed reserves of 0.4 million barrels of crude oil and natural gas liquids
and 57 billion cubic feet of natural gas and proved undeveloped reserves of 0.6
million barrels of crude oil and natural gas liquids and 65billion cubic
feet of natural gas.
in the preceding reserves information, consolidated
subsidiary and equity company reserves are reported separately. however, the
corporation operates its business with the same view of equity company reserves
as it has for reserves from consolidated subsidiaries.
the corporations overall volume capacity outlook,
based on projects coming on stream as anticipated, is for production capacity
to grow over the period 2013-2017. however, actual volumes will vary from year
to year due to the timing of individual project start-ups, operational outages,
reservoir performance, regulatory changes, asset sales, weather events, price
effects on production sharing contracts and other factors as described in item
1arisk factors of this report.
the estimation of proved reserves, which is based on
the requirement of reasonable certainty, is an ongoing process based on
rigorous technical evaluations, commercial and market assessments and detailed
analysis of well and reservoir information such as flow rates and reservoir
pressure declines. furthermore, the corporation only records proved reserves
for projects which have received significant funding commitments by management
made toward the development of the reserves. although the corporation is
reasonably certain that proved reserves will be produced, the timing and amount
recovered can be affected by a number of factors including completion of
development projects, reservoir performance, regulatory approvals and
significant changes in projections of long-term oil and gas price levels.
b. technologies used in establishing proved
reserves additions in 2012
additions to exxonmobils proved reserves in 2012 were
based on estimates generated through the integration of available and
appropriate geological, engineering and production data, utilizing
well-established technologies that have been demonstrated in the field to yield
repeatable and consistent results.
data used in these integrated assessments included
information obtained directly from the subsurface via wellbores, such as well
logs, reservoir core samples, fluid samples, static and dynamic pressure
information, production test data, and surveillance and performance
information. the data utilized also included subsurface information obtained
through indirect measurements including high-quality 2-d and 3-d seismic data,
calibrated with available well control information. the tools used to interpret
the data included proprietary seismic processing software, proprietary
reservoir modeling and simulation software, and commercially available data
analysis packages.
in some circumstances, where appropriate analog
reservoirs were available, reservoir parameters from these analogs were used to
increase the quality of and confidence in the reserves estimates.
c. qualifications of reserves
technical oversight group and internal controls over proved reserves
exxonmobil has a dedicated global reserves group that provides
technical oversight and is separate from the operating organization. primary
responsibilities of this group include oversight of the reserves estimation process
for compliance with securities and exchange commission (sec) rules and
regulations, review of annual changes in reserves estimates, and the reporting
of exxonmobils proved reserves. this group also maintains the official company
reserves estimates for exxonmobils proved reserves of crude and natural gas
liquids, bitumen, synthetic oil and natural gas. in addition, the group
provides training to personnel involved in the reserves estimation and
reporting process within exxonmobil and its affiliates. the group is managed by
and staffed with individuals that have an average of more than 20 years of
technical experience in the petroleum industry, including expertise in the
classification and categorization of reserves under the sec guidelines. this group
includes individuals who hold advanced degrees in either engineering or
geology. several members of the group hold professional registrations in their
field of expertise, and several have served on the oil and gas reserves
committee of the society of petroleum engineers.
the global reserves group maintains a central database
containing the official company global reserves estimates. appropriate
controls, including limitations on database access and update capabilities, are
in place to ensure data integrity within this central database. an annual
review of the systems controls is performed by internal audit. key components
of the reserves estimation process include technical evaluations and analysis
of well and field performance and a rigorous peer review. no changes may be
made to the reserves estimates in the central database, including additions of
any new initial reserves estimates or subsequent revisions, unless these
changes have been thoroughly reviewed and evaluated by duly authorized
personnel within the operating organization. in addition, changes to reserves
estimates that exceed certain thresholds require further review and approval of
the appropriate level of management within the operating organization before
the changes may be made in the central database. endorsement by the global reserves
group for all proved reserves changes is a mandatory component of this review
process. after all changes are made, reviews are held with senior management
for final endorsement.
2. proved undeveloped
reserves
at year-end 2012, approximately 9.9 billion
oil-equivalent barrels (goeb) of exxonmobils proved reserves were classified
as proved undeveloped. this represents 39 percent of the 25.2 goeb reported in
proved reserves. this compares to the 8.8 goeb of proved undeveloped reserves
reported at the end of 2011. the net increase is primarily due to the addition
of new projects in
canada and the united states. during
the year, exxonmobil conducted development activities in over 100 fields that
resulted in the transfer of approximately 0.5 goeb from proved undeveloped to
proved developed reserves by year-end. the largest transfers were related to
completion of drilling and the initiation of production activities in
unconventional fields in the united states and on new pad locations in the cold
lake field in canada.
one of exxonmobils requirements for reporting proved
reserves is that management has made significant funding commitments toward the
development of the reserves. exxonmobil has a disciplined investment strategy
and many major fields require long lead-time in order to be developed.
development projects typically take two to four years from the time of first
recording of proved reserves to the start of production of these reserves.
however, the development time for large and complex projects can exceed five
years. during 2012, discoveries and extensions related to new projects added
approximately 1.3 goeb of proved undeveloped reserves. the largest of these
additions were related to planned drilling in the united states. overall,
investments of $24.8 billion were made by the corporation during 2012 to
progress the development of reported proved undeveloped reserves, including $21.7
billion for oil and gas producing activities and an additional $3.1 billion for
other non-oil and gas producing activities such as the construction of support
infrastructure and other related facilities that were undertaken to progress
the development of proved undeveloped reserves. these investments represented 69
percent of the $36.1 billion in total reported upstream capital and exploration
expenditures.
proved undeveloped reserves in canada, kazakhstan, the
united states, and the netherlands have remained undeveloped for five years or
more primarily due to constraints on the capacity of infrastructure and the
pace of co-venturer/government funding, as well as the time required to
complete development for very large projects. the corporation is reasonably
certain that these proved reserves will be produced; however, the timing and
amount recovered can be affected by a number of factors including completion of
development projects, reservoir performance and regulatory approvals. of the
proved undeveloped reserves that have been reported for five or more years, 57
percent are contained in four fields in canada, kazakhstan and the netherlands.
the largest of these is related to the kearl project in canada, where
construction of the initial development was completed during 2012 and phased
start-up activities were under way. in kazakhstan, the proved undeveloped reserves
are related to the initial development of the offshore kashagan field which is
included in the north caspian production sharing agreement and the tengizchevroil
joint venture which includes a production license in the tengiz  korolev field
complex. the tengizchevroil joint venture is producing, and proved undeveloped
reserves will continue to move to proved developed as approved development
phases progress. the fourth field is the groningen gas field in the netherlands.
proved undeveloped reserves reported for this field are related to installation
of future stages of compression. these reserves will move to proved developed
when the additional stages of compression are installed to maintain field
delivery pressure. the remainder of proved undeveloped reserves are contained
in over 140 fields in 16 countries.

average production prices have been calculated by
using sales quantities from the corporations own production as the divisor.
average production costs have been computed by using net production quantities
for the divisor. the volumes of crude oil and natural gas liquids (ngl)
production used for this computation are shown in the oil and gas production
table in section 3.a. the volumes of natural gas used in the calculation are
the production volumes of natural gas available for sale and are also shown in
section 3.a. the natural gas available for sale volumes are different from
those shown in the reserves table in the oil and gas reserves part of the
supplemental information on oil and gas exploration and production activities
portion of the financial section of this report due to volumes consumed or
flared. gas is converted to an oil-equivalent basis at six million cubic feet
per one thousand barrels.

b. exploratory and development activities regarding
oil and gas resources extracted by mining technologies
syncrude operations. syncrude is a joint venture established to recover
shallow deposits of oil sands using open-pit mining methods to extract the
crude bitumen, and then upgrade it to produce a high-quality, light (32 degrees
api), sweet, synthetic crude oil. imperial oil limited is the owner of a 25
percent interest in the joint venture. exxon mobil corporation has a 69.6
percent interest in imperial oil limited. in 2012, the companys share of net
production of synthetic crude oil was about 69 thousand barrels per day and
share of net acreage was about 63thousand acres in the athabasca oil
sands deposit.
kearl project. the kearl project is a joint venture established to
recover shallow deposits of oil sands using open-pit mining methods to extract
the crude bitumen. imperial oil limited holds a 70.96 percent interest in the
joint venture and exxonmobil canada properties holds the other 29.04 percent.
exxon mobil corporation has a 69.6 percent interest in imperial oil limited and
a 100 percent interest in exxonmobil canada properties. kearl is comprised of
six oil sands leases covering about 48 thousand acres in the athabasca oil
sands deposit.
the kearl project is located approximately 40 miles
north of fort mcmurray, alberta, canada, and is expected to be developed in two
phases. bitumen will be extracted from oil sands produced from open-pit mining
operations, and processed through a bitumen extraction and froth treatment
plant. the product, a blend of bitumen and diluent, is planned to be shipped
via pipelines for distribution to north american markets. diluent is natural
gas condensate or other light hydrocarbons added to the crude bitumen to
facilitate transportation to market by pipeline. at year-end 2012, the
construction of the initial development of the kearl project was complete and
phased start-up activities were under way. construction on the kearl expansion
project continued during 2012.

gross and 5,680 net thousands of acres for 2011.
exxonmobils investment in developed and undeveloped
acreage is comprised of numerous concessions, blocks and leases. the terms and
conditions under which the corporation maintains exploration and/or production
rights to the acreage are property-specific, contractually defined and vary
significantly from property to property. work programs are designed to ensure
that the exploration potential of any property is fully evaluated before
expiration. in some instances, the corporation may elect to relinquish acreage
in advance of the contractual expiration date if the evaluation process is
complete and there is not a business basis for extension. in cases where
additional time may be required to fully evaluate acreage, the corporation has
generally been successful in obtaining extensions. the scheduled expiration of
leases and concessions for undeveloped acreage over the next three years is not
expected to have a material adverse impact on the corporation.
d. summary of acreage
terms
united states
oil and gas leases have an exploration period ranging
from one to ten years, and a production period that normally remains in effect
until production ceases. under certain circumstances, a lease may be held
beyond its exploration term even if production has not commenced. in some
instances, a fee interest is acquired where both the surface and the
underlying mineral interests are owned outright.
canada/south america
canada
exploration licenses or leases in onshore areas are acquired
for varying periods of time with renewals or extensions possible. these
licenses or leases entitle the holder to continue existing licenses or leases
upon completing specified work. in general, these license and lease agreements
are held as long as there is production on the licenses and leases. exploration
licenses in offshore eastern canada and the beaufort sea are held by work
commitments of various amounts and rentals. they are valid for a maximum term
of nine years. production licenses in the offshore are valid for 25 years, with
rights of extension for continued production. significant discovery licenses in
the offshore, relating to currently undeveloped discoveries, do not have a
definite term.
argentina
the federal onshore concession terms in argentina are
up to four years for the initial exploration period, up to three years for the
second exploration period and up to two years for the third exploration period.
a 50-percent relinquishment is required after each exploration period. an extension
after the third exploration period is possible for up to five years. the total
production term is 25 years with a ten-year extension possible, once a field
has been developed. argentine provinces are entitled to modify the concession
terms granted within their territories. the concession terms of the exploration
permits granted by neuquen province are up to six years for the initial
exploration period, up to four years for the second exploration period and up
to three years for the third exploration period depending on the classification
of the area. an extension after the third exploration period is possible for up
to one year.
europe
germany
exploration concessions are granted for an initial
maximum period of five years, with an unlimited number of extensions of up to
three years each. extensions are subject to specific, minimum work commitments.
production licenses are normally granted for 20 to 25 years with multiple
possible extensions as long as there is production on the license.
netherlands
under the mining law, effective january 1, 2003,
exploration and production licenses for both onshore and offshore areas are
issued for a period as explicitly defined in the license. the term is based on
the period of time necessary to perform the activities for which the license is
issued. license conditions are stipulated in the license and are based on the
mining law.
production rights granted prior to january 1, 2003,
remain subject to their existing terms, and differ slightly for onshore and
offshore areas. onshore production licenses issued prior to 1988 were
indefinite; from 1988 they were issued for a period as explicitly defined in
the license, ranging from 35 to 45 years. offshore production licenses issued
before 1976 were issued for a fixed period of 40 years; from 1976 they were
again issued for a period as explicitly defined in the license, ranging from 15
to 40 years.
norway
licenses issued prior to 1972 were for an initial
period of six years and an extension period of 40 years, with relinquishment of
at least one-fourth of the original area required at the end of the sixth year
and another one-fourth at the end of the ninth year. licenses issued between
1972 and 1997 were for an initial period of up to six years (with extension of
the initial period of one year at a time up to ten years after 1985), and an
extension period of up to 30 years, with relinquishment of at least one-half of
the original area required at the end of the initial period. licenses issued
after july 1, 1997, have an initial period of up to ten years and a normal
extension period of up to 30 years or in special cases of up to 50 years, and
with relinquishment of at least one-half of the original area required at the
end of the initial period.
united
kingdom
acreage terms are fixed by the government and are
periodically changed. for example, many of the early licenses issued under the
first four licensing rounds provided for an initial term of six years with
relinquishment of at least one-half of the original area at the end of the
initial term, subject to extension for a further 40 years. at the end of any
such 40-year term, licenses may continue in producing areas until cessation of
production; or licenses may continue in development areas for periods agreed on
a case-by-case basis until they become producing areas; or licenses terminate
in all other areas. the licensing regime was last updated in 2002, and the
majority of licenses issued have an initial term of four years with a second
term extension of four years and a final term of 18 years with a mandatory
relinquishment of 50 percent of the acreage after the initial term and of all
acreage that is not covered by a development plan at the end of the second term.
africa
angola
exploration and production activities are governed by
production sharing agreements with an initial exploration term of four years
and an optional second phase of two to three years. the production period is
for 25 years, and agreements generally provide for a negotiated extension.
chad
exploration permits are issued for a period of five
years, and are renewable for one or two further five-year periods. the terms
and conditions of the permits, including relinquishment obligations, are
specified in a negotiated convention. the production term is for 30 years and
may be extended at the discretion of the government.
equatorial guinea
exploration and production activities are governed by
production sharing contracts negotiated with the state ministry of mines,
industry and energy. the exploration periods are for ten to 15 years with
limited relinquishments in the absence of commercial discoveries. the
production period for crude oil is 30 years, while the production period for
gas is 50 years. under the hydrocarbons law enacted in 2006, the exploration
terms for new production sharing contracts are four to five years with a
maximum of two one-year extensions, unless the ministry agrees otherwise.
nigeria
exploration and production activities in the deepwater
offshore areas are typically governed by production sharing contracts (pscs)
with the national oil company, the nigerian national petroleum corporation
(nnpc). nnpc holds the underlying oil prospecting license (opl) and any
resulting oil mining lease (oml). the terms of the pscs are generally 30 years,
including a ten-year exploration period (an initial exploration phase plus one
or two optional periods) covered by an opl. upon commercial discovery, an opl
may be converted to an oml. partial relinquishment is required under the psc at
the end of the ten-year exploration period, and omls have a 20-year production
period that may be extended.
some exploration activities are carried out in
deepwater by joint ventures with local companies holding interests in an opl.
opls in deepwater offshore areas are valid for ten years and are non-renewable,
while in all other areas the licenses are for five years and also are
non-renewable. demonstrating a commercial discovery is the basis for conversion
of an opl to an oml.
omls granted prior to the 1969 petroleum act (i.e.,
under the mineral oils act 1914, repealed by the 1969 petroleum act) were for
30 years onshore and 40 years in offshore areas and have been renewed,
effective december 1, 2008, for a further period of 20 years, with a further
renewal option of 20 years. operations under these pre-1969 omls are conducted
under a joint venture agreement with nnpc rather than a psc. in 2000, a
memorandum of understanding (mou) was executed defining commercial terms
applicable to existing joint venture oil production. the mou may be terminated
on one calendar years notice.
omls granted under the 1969 petroleum act, which
include all deepwater omls, have a maximum term of 20 years without distinction
for onshore or offshore location and are renewable, upon 12 months written
notice, for another period of 20 years. omls not held by nnpc are also subject
to a mandatory 50-percent relinquishment after the first ten years of their
duration.
asia
azerbaijan
the production sharing agreement (psa) for the
development of the azeri-chirag-gunashli field is established for an initial
period of 30 years starting from the psa execution date in 1994.
other exploration and production activities are
governed by psas negotiated with the national oil company of azerbaijan. the
exploration period consists of three or four years with the possibility of a
one to three-year extension. the production period, which includes development,
is for 25 years or 35 years with the possibility of one or two five-year
extensions.
indonesia
exploration and production activities in indonesia are
generally governed by cooperation contracts, usually in the form of a
production sharing contract (psc), negotiated with bpmigas, a government agency
established in 2002 to manage upstream oil and gas activities. in 2012,
indonesias constitutional court ruled certain articles of law relating to
bpmigas to be unconstitutional, but stated that all existing pscs signed with
bpmigas should remain in force until their expiry, and the functions and duties
previously performed by bpmigas are to be carried out by the relevant ministry
of the government of indonesia until the promulgation of a new oil and gas law.
the current pscs have an exploration period of six years, which can be extended
up to 10 years, and an exploitation period of 20 years. pscs generally require
the contractor to relinquish 10 percent to 20 percent of the contract area
after three years and generally allow the contractor to retain no more than 50
percent to 80 percent of the original contract area after six years, depending
on the acreage and terms.
iraq
development and production activities in the
state-owned oil and gas fields are governed by contracts with regional oil
companies of the iraqi ministry of oil. an exxonmobil affiliate entered into a
contract with south oil company of the iraqi ministry of oil for the rights to
participate in the development and production activities of the west qurna
phasei oil and gas field effective march 1, 2010. the term of the
contract is 20 years with the right to extend for five years. the contract
provides for cost recovery plus per-barrel fees for incremental production
above specified levels.
exploration and production activities in the kurdistan
region of iraq are governed by production sharing contracts negotiated with the
regional government of kurdistan in 2011. the exploration term is for five
years with the possibility of two-year extensions. the production period is 20
years with the right to extend for five years.
kazakhstan
onshore exploration and production activities are
governed by the production license, exploration license and joint venture
agreements negotiated with the republic of kazakhstan. existing production
operations have a 40-year production period that commenced in 1993.
offshore exploration and production activities are
governed by a production sharing agreement negotiated with the republic of
kazakhstan. the exploration period is six years followed by separate appraisal
periods for each discovery. the production period for each discovery, which
includes development, is for 20 years from the date of declaration of
commerciality with the possibility of two ten-year extensions.
malaysia
exploration and production activities are governed by
production sharing contracts (pscs) negotiated with the national oil company.
the more recent pscs governing exploration and production activities have an
overall term of 24 to 38 years, depending on water depth, with possible
extensions to the exploration and/or development periods. the exploration
period is five to seven years with the possibility of extensions, after which
time areas with no commercial discoveries will be deemed relinquished. the
development period is from four to six years from commercial discovery, with
the possibility of extensions under special circumstances. areas from which
commercial production has not started by the end of the development period will
be deemed relinquished if no extension is granted. all extensions are subject
to the national oil companys prior written approval. the total production
period is 15 to 25 years from first commercial lifting, not to exceed the
overall term of the contract.
in 2008, the company reached agreement with the
national oil company for a new psc, which was subsequently signed in 2009.
under the new psc, from 2008 until march 31, 2012, the company was entitled to
undertake new development and production activities in oil fields under an
existing psc, subject to new minimum work and spending commitments, including
an enhanced oil recovery project in one of the oil fields. when the existing
psc expired on march 31, 2012, the producing fields covered by the existing psc
automatically became part of the new psc, which has a 25-year duration from
april 2008.
qatar
the state of qatar grants gas production development
project rights to develop and supply gas from the offshore north field to
permit the economic development and production of gas reserves sufficient to
satisfy the gas and lng sales obligations of these projects.
republic of yemen
the jannah production sharing agreement has a
development period extending 20 years from first commercial declaration, which
was made in june 1995.
russia
terms for exxonmobils acreage are fixed by the
production sharing agreement (psa) that became effective in 1996 between the
russian government and the sakhalin-1 consortium, of which exxonmobil is the
operator. the term of the psa is 20 years from the declaration of
commerciality, which would be 2021. the term may be extended thereafter in
ten-year increments as specified in the psa.
thailand
the petroleum act of 1971 allows production under
exxonmobils concession for 30 years with a ten-year extension at terms
generally prevalent at the time.
united arab emirates
exploration and production activities for the major
onshore oil fields in the emirate of abu dhabi are governed by a 75-year oil
concession agreement executed in 1939 and subsequently amended through various
agreements with the government of abu dhabi. an interest in the upper zakum
field, a major offshore field, was acquired effective as of january 2006, for a
term expiring march 2026.
australia/oceania
australia
exploration and production activities conducted
offshore in commonwealth waters are governed by federal legislation.
exploration permits are granted for an initial term of six years with two
possible five-year renewal periods. retention leases may be granted for
resources that are not commercially viable at the time of application, but are
expected to become commercially viable within 15 years. these are granted for
periods of five years and renewals may be requested. prior to july 1998,
production licenses were granted initially for 21 years, with a further renewal
of 21 years and thereafter indefinitely, i.e., for the life of the field.
effective from july 1998, new production licenses are granted indefinitely.
in each case, a production license may be terminated if no production
operations have been carried on for five years.
papua new guinea
exploration and production activities are governed by
the oil and gas act. petroleum prospecting licenses are granted for an initial
term of six years with a five-year extension possible (an additional extension
of three years is possible in certain circumstances). generally, a 50-percent
relinquishment of the license area is required at the end of the initial
six-year term, if extended. petroleum development licenses are granted for an
initial 25-year period. an extension of up to 20 years may be granted at the ministers
discretion. petroleum retention licenses may be granted for gas resources that
are not commercially viable at the time of application, but may become
commercially viable within the maximum possible retention time of 15 years.
petroleum retention licenses are granted for five-year terms, and may be
extended, at the ministers discretion, twice for the maximum retention time of
15 years. extensions of petroleum retention licenses may be for periods of less
than one year, renewable annually, if the minister considers at the time of
extension that the resources could become commercially viable in less than five
years.

iran threat
reduction and syria human rights act of 2012
the captioned act was signed by president obama on
august 10, 2012. among other things, the act extended the prohibition against
u.s. persons doing business with the government of iran to include such persons
non-u.s. subsidiaries. previously, non-u.s. subsidiaries were not covered by
this restriction. application of the restriction to non-u.s. subsidiaries took
effect on october 10, 2012. the act also requires registrants to disclose, in
their annual and quarterly reports, activities covered by the act which
occurred anytime during the period covered by the report, even if such
activities occurred prior to the effective date of the act and were permitted
at the time.
during the period from january to september, 2012,
exxonmobils majority-owned canadian affiliate, imperial oil limited (iol),
made several fleet sales of motor fuel with an aggregate total sales price of
approximately 11,000 canadian dollars to the iranian embassy in canada. iols
net profits attributable to these sales were less than 500 canadian dollars.
the sales were made without the involvement of any u.s. person and were
permitted by u.s. laws in effect at the time. no sales occurred after the
october 10, 2012, effective date, and we do not expect any such sales to occur
in the future.
the embassy sales stated above represent an activity
described in paragraph (d)(iii) of paragraph (1) of section 13(r) of the
securities and exchange act of 1934 and therefore are excluded from the
required investigation provisions of that statute.
item3.  legal proceedings
on october 31, 2012, the illinois attorney general and
will county state's attorney filed a civil complaint and sought a preliminary
injunction against exxonmobil oil corporation (emoc) relating to an october 18,
2012, release of oil mist from a pressure relief valve associated with the
coker unit at emocs joliet refinery. the refinery reported the incident
promptly to regulatory authorities and took prompt response actions. the
states civil complaint seeks a penalty in excess of $100,000. on november 14,
2012, the parties entered into an agreed order resolving some of the issues,
including the states demand for injunctive relief. as part of the agreed
order, emoc agreed to complete an investigation into the incident's cause and
to report the findings to the illinois environmental protection agency (iepa);
submit a work schedule for necessary improvements; report all pollutants and
quantities involved in the oil release incident; pay all reasonable response,
oversight and review costs relating to the release incurred by the iepa and the
attorney general, up to and not to exceed $50,000; and reimburse will county
for its reasonable response costs incurred in the course of providing emergency
action relating to the release, up to and not to exceed $20,000.
regarding a matter previously reported in the
corporations form 10-q for the second quarter of 2012, on december 17, 2012,
xto energy inc. (xto) entered into a settlement agreement and stipulated final

frequently used terms
listed below are definitions of several of exxonmobils
key business and financial performance measures. these definitions are provided
to facilitate understanding of the terms and their calculation.
cash flow from operations and asset sales
cash flow
from operations and asset sales is the sum of the net cash provided by
operating activities and proceeds associated with sales of subsidiaries,
property, plant and equipment, and sales and returns of investments from the
consolidated statement of cash flows. this cash flow reflects the total sources
of cash from both operating the corporations assets and from the divesting of
assets. the corporation employs a long-standing and regular disciplined review
process to ensure that all assets are contributing to the corporations
strategic objectives. assets are divested when they are no longer meeting these
objectives or are worth considerably more to others. because of the regular
nature of this activity, we believe it is useful for investors to consider
proceeds associated with asset sales together with cash provided by operating
activities when evaluating cash available for investment in the business and
financing activities, including shareholder distributions.

capital
employed is a measure of net investment. when viewed from the perspective of
how the capital is used by the businesses, it includes exxonmobils net share
of property, plant and equipment and other assets less liabilities, excluding
both short-term and long-term debt. when viewed from the perspective of the
sources of capital employed in total for the corporation, it includes
exxonmobils share of total debt and equity. both of these views include
exxonmobils share of amounts applicable to equity companies, which the
corporation believes should be included to provide a more comprehensive measure
of capital employed.

return on average capital employed
return on
average capital employed (roce) is a performance measure ratio. from the
perspective of the business segments, roce is annual business segment earnings
divided by average business segment capital employed (average of beginning and
end-of-year amounts). these segment earnings include exxonmobils share of
segment earnings of equity companies, consistent with our capital employed
definition, and exclude the cost of financing. the corporations total roce is
net income attributable to exxonmobil excluding the after-tax cost of
financing, divided by total corporate average capital employed. the corporation
has consistently applied its roce definition for many years and views it as the
best measure of historical capital productivity in our capital-intensive,
long-term industry, both to evaluate managements performance and to
demonstrate to shareholders that capital has been used wisely over the long
term. additional measures, which are more cash flow based, are used to make investment
decisions.

overview
the
following discussion and analysis of exxonmobils financial results, as well as
the accompanying financial statements and related notes to consolidated
financial statements to which they refer, are the responsibility of the
management of exxon mobil corporation. the corporations accounting and
financial reporting fairly reflect its straightforward business model involving
the extracting, manufacturing and marketing of hydrocarbons and
hydrocarbon-based products. the corporations business model involves the
production (or purchase), manufacture and sale of physical products, and all
commercial activities are directly in support of the underlying physical
movement ofgoods.
exxonmobil, with its resource base, financial strength, disciplined
investment approach and technology portfolio, is well-positioned to participate
in substantial investments to develop new energy supplies. while commodity
prices are volatile on a short-term basis and depend on supply and demand,
exxonmobils investment decisions are based on our long-term business outlook,
using a disciplined approach in selecting and pursuing the most attractive
investment opportunities. the corporate plan is a fundamental annual management
process that is the basis for setting near-term operating and capital
objectives in addition to providing the longer-term economic assumptions used
for investment evaluation purposes. volumes are based on individual field
production profiles, which are also updated annually. price ranges for crude
oil, natural gas, refined products, and chemical products are based on
corporate plan assumptions developed annually by major region and are utilized
for investment evaluation purposes. potential investment opportunities are
tested over a wide range of economic scenarios to establish the resiliency of
each opportunity. once investments are made, a reappraisal process is completed
to ensure relevant lessons are learned and improvements are incorporated into
future projects.
business environment and risk assessment
long-term business outlook
by 2040, the
worlds population is projected to grow to approximately 8.7 billion people, or
about 1.9 billion more than in 2010. coincident with this population increase,
the corporation expects worldwide economic growth to average close to 3 percent
per year. expanding prosperity across a growing global population is expected
to coincide with an increase in primary energy demand of about 35 percent by
2040 versus 2010, even with substantial efficiency gains around the world. this
demand increase is expected to be concentrated in developing countries (i.e.,
those that are not member nations of the organization for economic cooperation
and development).
as economic progress for billions of people drives demand higher,
increasing penetration of energy-efficient and lower-emission fuels,
technologies and practices are expected to contribute to significantly lower
levels of energy consumption and emissions per unit of economic output over
time. efficiency gains will result from anticipated improvements in the
transportation and power generation sectors, driven by the penetration of
advanced technologies, as well as many other improvements that span the
residential, commercial and industrial sectors.
energy for transportation  including cars, trucks, ships, trains and
airplanes  is expected to increase by about 40 percent from 2010 to 2040. the
global growth in transportation demand is likely to account for approximately
70 percent of the growth in liquid fuels demand over this period. nearly all
the worlds transportation fleets will continue to run on liquid fuels because
they provide a large quantity of energy in small volumes, making them easy to transport
and widely available.
demand for electricity around the world is likely to increase
approximately 85 percent by 2040, led by growth in developing countries.
consistent with this projection, power generation is expected to remain the
largest and fastest-growing major segment of global energy demand. meeting the
expected growth in power demand will require a diverse set of energy sources.
natural gas demand is likely to grow most significantly and become the leading
source of generated electricity by 2040, reflecting the efficiency of gas-fired
power plants. today, coal has the largest fuel share in the power sector, but
its share is likely to decline
managements discussion and analysis of financial
condition and results of operations
significantly by 2040
as policies are gradually adopted to reduce environmental impacts including
those related to local air quality and greenhouse gas emissions. nuclear power
and renewables, led by wind, are expected to grow significantly over the
period.
liquid fuels provide the largest share of energy supply today due to
their broad-based availability, affordability and ease of transport to meet
consumer needs. by 2040, global demand for liquids is expected to grow to
approximately 113 million barrels of oil-equivalent per day, an increase of about
30 percent from 2010. global demand for liquid fuels will be met by a wide
variety of sources. conventional crude and condensate production is expected to
remain relatively flat through 2040. however, growth is expected from a wide
variety of sources, including deep-water resources, oil sands, tight oil,
natural gas liquids, and biofuels. the worlds resource base is sufficient to
meet projected demand through 2040 as technology advances continue to expand
the availability of economic supply options. however, access to resources and
timely investments will remain critical to meeting global needs with reliable,
affordable supplies.
natural gas is a versatile fuel for a wide variety of applications, and
is expected to be the fastest growing major fuel source through 2040. global
demand is expected to rise about 65 percent from 2010 to 2040, with demand
increases in major regions around the world requiring new sources of supply.
helping meet these needs will be significant growth in supplies of unconventional
gas  the natural gas found in shale and other rock formations that was once
considered uneconomic to produce. by 2040, unconventional gas is likely to
approach one-third of global gas supplies, up from less than 15 percent in
2010. growing natural gas demand will also stimulate significant growth in the
worldwide liquefied natural gas (lng) market, which is expected to reach about
15 percent of global gas demand by 2040.
the worlds energy mix is highly diverse and will remain so through
2040. oil is expected to remain the largest source of energy with its share
remaining close to one-third in 2040. coal is currently the second largest
source of energy, but it is likely to lose that position to natural gas by
approximately 2025. the share of natural gas is expected to exceed 25 percent
by 2040, while the share of coal falls to less than 20 percent. nuclear power
is projected to grow significantly, albeit at a slower pace than otherwise
expected in the aftermath of the fukushima incident in japan following the
earthquake and tsunami in march 2011. total renewable energy is likely to
reach close to 15 percent of total energy by 2040, including biomass, hydro and
geothermal at a combined share of about 11 percent. total energy supplied from
wind, solar and biofuels is expected to increase close to 450 percent from 2010
to 2040, reaching a combined share of 3 to 4 percent of world energy.
the corporation anticipates that the worlds available oil and gas
resource base will grow not only from new discoveries, but also from reserve
increases in previously discovered fields. technology will underpin these
increases. the cost to develop and supply these resources will be significant.
according to the international energy agency, the investment required to meet total
oil and gas energy needs worldwide over the period 2012-2035 will be close to
$19 trillion (measured in 2011 dollars) or close to $800 billion per year on
average.
international accords and underlying regional and national regulations
for greenhouse gas reduction are evolving with uncertain timing and outcome,
making it difficult to predict their business impact. exxonmobil includes
estimates of potential costs related to possible public policies covering
energy-related greenhouse gas emissions in its long-term energy outlook, which
is used for assessing the business environment and in its investment
evaluations.
the information provided in the long-term business outlook includes
exxonmobils internal estimates and forecasts based upon internal data and
analyses as well as publicly available information from external sources
including the international energy agency.
upstream
exxonmobil
continues to maintain a diverse portfolio of exploration and development
opportunities, which enables the corporation to be selective, maximizing
shareholder value and mitigating political and technical risks. exxonmobils
fundamental upstream business strategies guide our global exploration,
development, production, and gas and power marketing activities. these strategies
include identifying and selectively capturing the highest quality
opportunities, exercising a disciplined approach to investing and cost
management, developing and applying high-impact technologies, maximizing the
profitability of existing oil and gas production, and capitalizing on growing
natural gas and power markets. these strategies are underpinned by a
relentless focus on operational excellence, commitment to innovative
technologies, development of our employees, and investment in the communities
within which we operate.
as future development projects and drilling activities bring new
production online, the corporation expects a shift in the geographic mix of its
production volumes between now and 2017. oil and natural gas output from north
america is expected to increase over the next five years based on current
capital activity plans. currently, this growth area accounts for 32 percent of
the corporations production. by 2017, it is expected to generate about 35
percent of total volumes. the remainder of the corporations production is
expected to include contributions from both established operations and new
projects around the globe.
managements discussion and analysis of financial
condition and results of operations
in addition to an evolving geographic mix, we expect
there will also be continued change in the type of opportunities from which
volumes are produced. production from diverse resource types utilizing
specialized technologies such as arctic technology, deepwater drilling and
production systems, heavy oil and oil sands recovery processes, unconventional
gas and oil production and lng is expected to grow from about 45 percent to
around 55 percent of the corporations output between now and 2017. we do not
anticipate that the expected change in the geographic mix of production
volumes, and in the types of opportunities from which volumes will be produced,
will have a material impact on the nature and the extent of the risks disclosed
in item 1a. risk factors, or result in a material change in our level of unit
operating expenses. the corporations overall volume capacity outlook, based on
projects coming onstream as anticipated, is for production capacity to grow
over the period 2013-2017. however, actual volumes will vary from year to year
due to the timing of individual project start-ups and other capital activities,
operational outages, reservoir performance, performance of enhanced oil
recovery projects, regulatory changes, asset sales, weather events, price
effects under production sharing contracts and other factors described in item
1a. risk factors. enhanced oil recovery projects extract hydrocarbons from
reservoirs in excess of that which may be produced through primary recovery,
i.e., through pressure depletion or natural aquifer support. they include the
injection of water, gases or chemicals into a reservoir to produce hydrocarbons
otherwise unobtainable.
downstream
exxonmobils
downstream is a large, diversified business with refining, logistics, and
marketing complexes around the world. the corporation has a presence in mature
markets in north america and europe, as well as in the growing asia pacific
region. exxonmobils fundamental downstream business strategies position the
company to deliver long-term growth in shareholder value that is superior to
competition across a range of market conditions. these strategies include
maintaining best-in-class operations in all aspects of the business, maximizing
value from leading-edge technologies, capitalizing on integration across
exxonmobil businesses, selectively investing for resilient, advantaged returns,
leading the industry in efficiency and effectiveness, and providing quality,
valued products and services to customers.
exxonmobil has an ownership interest in 32 refineries, located in 17
countries, with distillation capacity of 5.4 million barrels per day and
lubricant basestock manufacturing capacity of 126 thousand barrels per day.
exxonmobils fuels and lubes marketing businesses have significant global
reach, with multiple channels to market serving a diverse customer base. our
portfolio of world-renowned brands includes exxon, mobil, esso, and mobil 1.
the downstream industry environment remains challenging. demand
weakness and overcapacity in the refining sector will continue to put pressure
on margins. in the near term, we see variability in refining margins, with
some regions seeing stronger margins as refineries rationalize. in markets like
north america, lower raw material and energy costs driven by the increasing
crude and natural gas production strengthened refining margins in several
areas.
refining margins are largely driven by differences in commodity prices
and are a function of the difference between what a refinery pays for its raw
materials (primarily crude oil) and the market prices for the range of products
produced (primarily gasoline, heating oil, diesel oil, jet fuel and fuel oil).
crude oil and many products are widely traded with published prices, including
those quoted on multiple exchanges around the world (e.g., new york mercantile
exchange and intercontinental exchange). prices for these commodities are
determined by the global marketplace and are influenced by many factors,
including global and regional supply/demand balances, inventory levels,
refinery operations, import/export balances, currency fluctuations, seasonal demand,
weather and political climate.
exxonmobils long-term outlook is that refining margins will remain
weak as competition in the industry remains intense and, in the near term, new
capacity additions outpace the growth in global demand. additionally, as described
in more detail in item 1a. risk factors, proposed carbon policy and other
climate-related regulations in many countries, as well as the continued growth
in biofuels mandates, could have negative impacts on the refining business.
in the retail fuels marketing business, competition continues to cause
inflation-adjusted margins to decline. in 2012, exxonmobil progressed the
transition of the direct served (i.e., dealer, company-operated) retail network
in the u.s. to a more capital-efficient branded distributor model. this
transition was announced in 2008 and is nearing completion.
our lubricants business continues to grow. exxonmobil is a market
leader in high-value synthetic lubricants, and we continue to grow our business
in key markets such as china, india and russia at rates considerably faster
than industry.
the downstream portfolio is continually evaluated during all parts of
the business cycle, and numerous asset divestments have been made over the past
decade. in 2012, we divested our downstream businesses in argentina, uruguay,
paraguay, central america, malaysia, and switzerland. we also restructured and
reduced our holdings in japan. when investing in the downstream, exxonmobil
remains focused on selective and resilient projects. these investments
capitalize on the corporations world-class scale and integration, industry
leading efficiency, leading-edge technology and respected brands, enabling
exxonmobil to take advantage of attractive emerging growth opportunities around
the globe. in 2012, the company completed the hydrofiner conversion project at
the fawley, united kingdom, refinery to produce higher-value ultra-low sulfur
diesel.
managements discussion and analysis of financial
condition and results of operations

activities to build a new diesel hydrotreater are expected to complete in 2013,
adding capacity of more than 2 million gallons per day of ultra-low sulfur
diesel to meet increasing demand in the asia pacific region. additionally,
construction of a lower sulfur fuels project at the joint saudi aramco and exxonmobil
samref refinery in yanbu, saudi arabia is also underway. the project will
include new gasoline and expanded diesel hydrotreating and sulfur recovery
equipment, and completion is expected by the end of 2013. we are also expanding
our singapore and china lube oil blending plants to support future demand
growth in these emerging markets.
chemical
worldwide
petrochemical demand grew modestly in 2012 with substantial variations in
regional performance. in north america, unconventional natural gas continued
to provide advantaged ethane feedstock and low cost energy for steam crackers
and a favorable margin environment for integrated chemical producers. margins
in asia remained low, with excess ethylene supply. margins and volumes
declined in europe with the weaker economy. specialty products overall
reported firm global demand and margins.
exxonmobil benefited from continued operational excellence and a
balanced portfolio of products. in addition to being a worldwide supplier of
commodity petrochemical products, exxonmobil chemical also has a number of
less-cyclical specialties business lines, which delivered strong results in
2012. chemicals competitive advantages are due to its business mix, broad
geographic coverage, investment and cost discipline, integration with
refineries or upstream gas processing facilities, superior feedstock
management, leading proprietary technology and product application expertise.
in 2012 exxonmobil completed construction of the singapore
petrochemical expansion project and commenced start-up operations at one of the
worlds largest ethylene steam crackers, the centerpiece of the companys
multi-billion dollar expansion at the complex. powered by a new 220-megawatt
cogeneration plant, the expansion adds 2.6 million tonnes per year of new
finished product capacity.

total cash
and cash equivalents were $9.9 billion at the end of 2012, $3.1 billion lower
than the prior year. higher earnings and a higher adjustment for non-cash
transactions were more than offset by lower proceeds from sales of subsidiaries
and property, plant and equipment, a net debt decrease compared to a prior year
debt increase, and a higher adjustment for net gains on asset sales. included
in total cash and cash equivalents at year-end 2012 was $0.3 billion of
restricted cash.
total cash and cash equivalents were $13.1 billion at the end of 2011,
$4.6 billion higher than the prior year. higher earnings, proceeds associated
with asset sales, including a $3.6 billion deposit for a potential asset sale,
and a net debt increase in contrast with prior year debt repurchases were
partially offset by a higher level of purchases of exxonmobil shares and a
higher level of capital spending. included in total cash and cash equivalents
at year-end 2011 was $0.4 billion of restricted cash. for additional details,
see the consolidated statement of cash flows.
although the corporation has access to significant capacity of
long-term and short-term liquidity, internally generated funds cover the
majority of its financial requirements. cash that may be temporarily available
as surplus to the corporations immediate needs is carefully managed through
counterparty quality and investment guidelines to ensure it is secure and
readily available to meet the corporations cash requirements and to optimize
returns.
to support cash flows in future periods the corporation will need to
continually find and develop new fields, and continue to develop and apply new
technologies and recovery processes to existing fields, in order to maintain or
increase production. after a period of production at plateau rates, it is the
nature of oil and gas fields eventually to produce at declining rates for the
remainder of their economic life. averaged over all the corporations existing
oil and gas fields and without new projects, exxonmobils production is
expected to decline at an average of approximately 3 percent per year over the
next few years. decline rates can vary widely by individual field due to a
number of factors, including, but not limited to, the type of reservoir, fluid
properties, recovery mechanisms, work activity, and age of the field.
furthermore, the corporations net interest in production for individual fields
can vary with price and contractual terms.
the corporation has long been successful at offsetting the effects of
natural field decline through disciplined investments in quality opportunities
and project execution. over the last decade, this has resulted in net annual
additions to proved reserves that have exceeded the amount produced. projects
are in progress or planned to increase production capacity. however, these
volume increases are subject to a variety of risks including project start-up
timing, operational outages, reservoir performance, crude oil and natural gas
prices, weather events, and regulatory changes. the corporations cash flows
are also highly dependent on crude oil and natural gas prices. please refer to
item1a. risk factors for a more complete discussion of risks.
the corporations financial strength enables it to make large,
long-term capital expenditures. capital and exploration expenditures in 2012
were $39.8 billion, reflecting the corporations continued active investment
program. the corporation anticipates an investment profile of about $38 billion
per year for the next several years. actual spending could vary depending on
the progress of individual projects and property acquisitions. the corporation
has a large and diverse portfolio of development projects and exploration
opportunities, which helps mitigate the overall political and technical risks
of the corporations upstream segment and associated cash flow. further, due to
its financial strength, debt capacity and diverse portfolio of opportunities,
the risk associated with failure or delay of any single project would not have
a significant impact on the corporations liquidity or ability to generate
sufficient cash flows for operations and its fixed commitments. the purchase
and sale of oil and gas properties have not had a significant impact on the
amount or timing of cash flows from operating activities.
managements discussion and analysis of financial
condition and results of operations
cash flow from operating activities
cash provided by operating activities totaled $56.2
billion in 2012, $0.8 billion higher than 2011. the major source of funds was
net income including noncontrolling interests of $47.7 billion, an increase of
$5.5 billion. the noncash provision of $15.9 billion for depreciation and
depletion was slightly higher than 2011. the adjustments for other noncash
transactions and changes in operational working capital, excluding cash and debt,
both increased cash in 2012, while the adjustment for net gains on asset sales
decreased cash by $13.0 billion in 2012.
cash provided by operating activities totaled $55.3
billion in 2011, $6.9 billion higher than 2010. the major source of funds was
net income including noncontrolling interests of $42.2 billion, adjusted for
the noncash provision of $15.6 billion for depreciation and depletion, both of
which increased. changes in operational working capital, excluding cash and
debt, and the adjustment for net gains on asset sales decreased cash in 2011.
net working capital continued to be negative as total current liabilities of
$77.5 billion exceeded total current assets of $73.0 billion at year-end 2011.
cash flow from
investing activities
cash used in investment activities netted to $25.6
billion in 2012, $3.4 billion higher than 2011. spending for property, plant
and equipment of $34.3 billion increased $3.3 billion from 2011. proceeds
associated with sales of subsidiaries, property, plant and equipment, and sales
and returns of investments of $7.7 billion compared to $11.1 billion in 2011.
the decrease reflects that a $3.6 billion deposit was received in 2011 for a
sale that closed in 2012. additional investments and advances were $2.6 billion
lower in 2012.
cash used in investment activities netted to $22.2
billion in 2011, $2.0 billion lower than 2010. spending for property, plant and
equipment of $31.0 billion increased $4.1 billion from 2010. proceeds
associated with sales of subsidiaries, property, plant and equipment, and sales
and returns of investments of $11.1 billion compared to $3.3 billion in 2010.
the increase primarily reflects the sale of upstream canadian, u.k. and other
producing properties and assets, the sale of u.s. service stations, and a
$3.6billion deposit for a potential asset sale. additional investments
and advances were $2.3 billion higher in 2011.
cash flow from
financing activities
cash used in
financing activities was $33.9 billion in 2012, $5.6 billion higher than 2011.
dividend payments on common shares increased to $2.18 per share from $1.85 per
share and totaled $10.1 billion, a pay-out of 22 percent of net income. total
debt decreased $5.5 billion to $11.6 billion at year-end.
exxonmobil share of equity increased $11.5 billion to $165.9 billion.
the addition to equity for earnings of $44.9 billion was partially offset by
reductions for distributions to exxonmobil shareholders of $10.1 billion of
dividends and $20.0 billion of purchases of shares of exxonmobil stock to
reduce shares outstanding.
during 2012, exxon mobil
corporation purchased 244 million shares of its common stock for the treasury
at a gross cost of $21.1 billion. these purchases were to reduce the number of
shares outstanding and to offset shares issued in conjunction with company
benefit plans and programs. shares outstanding were reduced by 4.9 percent from
4,734 million to 4,502 million at the end of 2012. purchases were made in both
the open market and through negotiated transactions. purchases may be
increased, decreased or discontinued at any time without prior notice.
cash used in

this table
excludes commodity purchase obligations (volumetric commitments but no fixed or
minimum price) which are resold shortly after purchase, either in an active,
highly liquid market or under long-term, unconditional sales contracts with
similar pricing terms. examples include long-term, noncancelable lng and
natural gas purchase commitments and commitments to purchase refinery products
at market prices. inclusion of such commitments would not be meaningful in
assessing liquidity and cash flow, because these purchases will be offset in
the same periods by cash received from the related sales transactions. the
table also excludes unrecognized tax benefits totaling $7.7 billion as of
december31, 2012, because the corporation is unable to make reasonably
reliable estimates of the timing of cash settlements with the respective taxing
authorities. further details on the unrecognized tax benefits can be found in
note 19, income, sales-based and other taxes.
notes:
(1) includes capitalized lease
obligations of $431 million.
(2) the amount due in one year is
included in notes and loans payable of $3,653 million.
(3) the fair value of asset
retirement obligations, primarily upstream asset removal costs at the
completion of field life.
(4) the amount by which the
benefit obligations exceeded the fair value of fund assets for certain u.s. and
non-u.s. pension and other postretirement plans at year end. the payments by
period include expected contributions to funded pension plans in 2013 and
estimated benefit payments for unfunded plans in all years.
(5) minimum commitments for
operating leases, shown on an undiscounted basis, cover drilling equipment,
tankers, service stations and other properties.
(6) unconditional purchase
obligations (upos) are those long-term commitments that are noncancelable or
cancelable only under certain conditions, and that third parties have used to
secure financing for the facilities that will provide the contracted goods or
services. the undiscounted obligations of $1,127 million mainly pertain to
pipeline throughput agreements and include $584 million of obligations to
equity companies.
(7) take-or-pay obligations are
noncancelable, long-term commitments for goods and services other than upos.
the undiscounted obligations of $26,209 million mainly pertain to manufacturing
supply, pipeline and terminaling agreements and include $187 million of
obligations to equity companies.
(8) firm commitments related to
capital projects, shown on an undiscounted basis, totaled approximately $32.5
billion. these commitments were primarily associated with upstream projects
outside the u.s., of which $18.4 billion was associated with projects in canada,
australia, africa and malaysia. the corporation expects to fund the majority
of these projects through internal cash flow.
managements discussion and analysis of financial
condition and results of operations
guarantees
the
corporation and certain of its consolidated subsidiaries were contingently
liable at december31, 2012, for guarantees relating to notes, loans and
performance under contracts (note 16). where guarantees for environmental
remediation and other similar matters do not include a stated cap, the amounts
reflect managements estimate of the maximum potential exposure. these guarantees
are not reasonably likely to have a material effect on the corporations financial
condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of
operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.
financial strength
on
december31, 2012, unused credit lines for short-term financing totaled
approximately $3.5 billion (note 6).

management
views the corporations financial strength, as evidenced by the above financial
ratios and other similar measures, to be a competitive advantage of strategic
importance. the corporations sound financial position gives it the opportunity
to access the worlds capital markets in the full range of market conditions,
and enables the corporation to take on large, long-term capital commitments in
the pursuit of maximizing shareholder value.
litigation and other contingencies
as discussed
in note 16, a variety of claims have been made against exxonmobil and certain
of its consolidated subsidiaries in a number of pending lawsuits. based on a
consideration of all relevant facts and circumstances, the corporation does not
believe the ultimate outcome of any currently pending lawsuit against
exxonmobil will have a material adverse effect upon the corporations
operations, financial condition, or financial statements taken as a whole.
there are no events or uncertainties beyond those already included in reported
financial information that would indicate a material change in future operating
results or financial condition. refer to note 16 for additional information on
legal proceedings and other contingencies.

exploration expenses included.
capital and
exploration expenditures in 2012 were $39.8 billion, as the corporation
continued to pursue opportunities to find and produce new supplies of oil and
natural gas to meet global demand for energy. the corporation anticipates an
investment profile of about $38 billion per year for the next several years.
actual spending could vary depending on the progress of individual projects and
property acquisitions.
upstream spending of $36.1 billion in 2012 was up 9 percent from 2011,
reflecting investments in the gulf of mexico and continued progress on
world-class projects in canada, australia and papua new guinea. property
acquisition costs in 2012 were comparable to 2011. the majority of expenditures
are on development projects, which typically take two to four years from the
time of recording proved undeveloped reserves to the start of production from
those reserves. the percentage of proved developed reserves was 61 percent of
total proved reserves at year-end 2012, and has been over 60 percent for the
last five years, indicating that proved reserves are consistently moved from
undeveloped to developed status. capital investments in the downstream totaled
$2.3 billion in 2012, an increase of $0.1 billion from 2011, mainly reflecting
higher environmental and energy-related refining project spending. the chemical
capital expenditures of $1.4 billion were the same level as in 2011 with higher
investments in the u.s., saudi arabia and china offsetting reduced spending on
the singapore expansion as it approaches full start-up.

current and deferred, was $31.0 billion, flat with 2011, with the impact of
higher earnings offset by the lower effective tax rate. the effective tax rate
was 44 percent compared to 46 percent in the prior year due to a lower
effective tax rate on divestments. sales-based and all other taxes and duties
of $71.3 billion in 2012 decreased $5.8 billion reflecting the japan restructuring.

share of pre-tax income from the upstream segment in 2011 increased the
effective tax rate to 46 percent compared to 45 percent in 2010. sales-based
and all other taxes and duties of $77.0 billion in 2011 increased $9.4 billion,

exxonmobils businesses, new and ongoing measures aretaken to prevent and
minimize the impact of our operations on air,water and ground. these
include a significant investment in refining infrastructure and technology to
manufacture clean fuels as well asprojects to monitor and reduce nitrogen
oxide, sulfur oxide and greenhouse gas emissions and expenditures for asset
retirement obligations. using definitions and guidelines established by the american
petroleum institute, exxonmobils 2012 worldwide environmental expenditures for
all such preventative and remediation steps, including exxonmobils share of
equity company expenditures, were about $5.5 billion. thetotal cost for
such activities is expected to have a modest increase in 2013 and 2014 (with
capital expenditures approximately 45 percent of the total).
environmental liabilities
the
corporation accrues environmental liabilities when it is probable that
obligations have been incurred and the amounts can be reasonably estimated.
this policy applies to assets or businesses currently owned or previously
disposed. exxonmobil has accrued liabilities for probable environmental
remediation obligations at various sites, including multiparty sites where the
u.s. environmental protection agency has identified exxonmobil as one of the
potentially responsible parties. the involvement of other financially
responsible companies at these multiparty sites could mitigate exxonmobils
actual joint and several liability exposure. at present, no individual site is
expected to have losses material to exxonmobils operations or financial condition.
consolidated company provisions made in 2012 for environmental liabilities were
$391 million ($420 million in 2011) and the balance sheet reflects accumulated
liabilities of $841 million as of december31, 2012, and $886 million as
of december31, 2011.

crude oil,
natural gas, petroleum product and chemical prices have fluctuated in response
to changing market forces. the impacts of these price fluctuations on earnings
from upstream, downstream and chemical operations have varied. in the upstream,
a $1perbarrel change in the weighted-average realized price of oil
would have approximately a $350 million annual after-tax effect on upstream
consolidated plus equity company earnings. similarly, a $0.10 per kcf change in
the worldwide average gas realization would have approximately a $200 million
annual after-tax effect on upstream consolidated plus equity company earnings.
for any given period, the extent of actual benefit or detriment will be
dependent on the price movements of individual types of crude oil, taxes and
other government take impacts, price adjustment lags in long-term gas
contracts, and crude and gas production volumes. accordingly, changes in
benchmark prices for crude oil and natural gas only provide broad indicators of
changes in the earnings experienced in any particular period.
in the very competitive downstream and chemical environments, earnings
are primarily determined by margin capture rather than absolute price levels of
products sold. refining margins are a function of the difference between what a
refiner pays for its raw materials (primarily crude oil) and the market prices
for the range of products produced. these prices in turn depend on global and
regional supply/demand balances, inventory levels, refinery operations,
import/export balances and weather.
the global energy markets can give rise to extended periods in which
market conditions are adverse to one or more of the corporations businesses.
such conditions, along with the capital-intensive nature of the industry and
very long lead times associated with many of our projects, underscore the
importance of maintaining a strong financial position. management views the
corporations financial strength as a competitive advantage.
managements discussion and analysis of financial
condition and results of operations
in general, segment results are not dependent on the
ability to sell and/or purchase products to/from other segments. instead, where
such sales take place, they are the result of efficiencies and competitive
advantages of integrated refinery/chemical complexes. additionally,
intersegment sales are at market-based prices. the products bought and sold
between segments can also be acquired in worldwide markets that have
substantial liquidity, capacity and transportation capabilities. about 35
percent of the corporations intersegment sales are crude oil produced by the
upstream and sold to the downstream. other intersegment sales include those
between refineries and chemical plants related to raw materials, feedstocks and
finished products.
although price levels of crude oil and natural gas may rise or fall
significantly over the short to medium term due to political events, opec
actions and other factors, industry economics over the long term will continue
to be driven by market supply and demand. accordingly, the corporation tests
the viability of all of its investments over a broad range of future prices.
the corporations assessment is that its operations will continue to be
successful in a variety of market conditions. this is the outcome of
disciplined investment and asset management programs.
the corporation has an active asset management program in which
underperforming assets are either improved to acceptable levels or considered
for divestment. the asset management program includes a disciplined, regular
review to ensure that all assets are contributing to the corporations
strategic objectives. the result is an efficient capital base, and the
corporation has seldom had to write down the carrying value of assets, even
during periods of low commodity prices.
risk management
the corporations
size, strong capital structure, geographic diversity and the complementary
nature of the upstream, downstream and chemical businesses reduce the
corporations enterprise-wide risk from changes in interest rates, currency
rates and commodity prices. as a result, the corporation makes limited use of
derivative instruments to mitigate the impact of such changes. with respect to
derivatives activities, the corporation believes that there are no material
market or credit risks to the corporations financial position, results of
operations or liquidity as a result of the derivatives described in note 13.
the corporation does not engage in speculative derivative activities or
derivative trading activities nor does it use derivatives with leveraged
features. credit risk associated with the corporations derivative position is
mitigated by several factors, including the quality of and financial limits
placed on derivative counterparties. the corporation maintains a system of
controls that includes the authorization, reporting and monitoring of
derivative activity.
the corporation is exposed to changes in interest rates, primarily on
its short-term debt and the portion of long-term debt that carries floating
interest rates. the impact of a 100-basis-point change in interest rates
affecting the corporations debt would not be material to earnings, cash flow
or fair value. although the corporation issues long-term debt from time to time
and maintains a commercial paper program, internally generated funds are expected
to cover the majority of its net near-term financial requirements. however,
some joint-venture partners are dependent on the credit markets, and their
funding ability may impact the development pace of joint-venture projects.
the corporation conducts business in many foreign currencies and is
subject to exchange rate risk on cash flows related to sales, expenses,
financing and investment transactions. the impacts of fluctuations in exchange
rates on exxonmobils geographically and functionally diverse operations are
varied and often offsetting in amount. the corporation makes limited use of
currency exchange contracts to mitigate the impact of changes in currency
values, and exposures related to the corporations limited use of the currency
exchange contracts are not material.
inflation and other uncertainties
the general
rate of inflation in many major countries of operation has remained moderate
over the past few years, and the associated impact on non-energy costs has
generally been mitigated by cost reductions from efficiency and productivity
improvements. increased demand for certain services and materials has resulted
in higher operating and capital costs in recent years. the corporation works to
counter upward pressure on costs through its economies of scale in global
procurement and its efficient project management practices.
managements discussion and analysis of financial
condition and results of operations
critical accounting estimates
the
corporations accounting and financial reporting fairly reflect its
straightforward business model involving the extracting, refining and marketing
of hydrocarbons and hydrocarbon-based products. the preparation of financial
statements in conformity with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles
(gaap) requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the
reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and the
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. the corporations accounting
policies are summarized in note 1.
oil and gas reserves
evaluations
of oil and gas reserves are important to the effective management of upstream
assets. they are integral to making investment decisions about oil and gas
properties such as whether development should proceed. oil and gas reserve
quantities are also used as the basis for calculating unit-of-production depreciation
rates and for evaluating impairment.
oil and gas reserves include both proved and unproved
reserves. proved oil and gas reserves are those quantities of oil and gas,
which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with
reasonable certainty to be economically producible. unproved reserves are those
with less than reasonable certainty of recoverability and include probable
reserves. probable reserves are reserves that are more likely to be recovered
than not.
the estimation of proved reserves is an ongoing
process based on rigorous technical evaluations, commercial and market
assessment, and detailed analysis of well information such as flow rates and
reservoir pressure declines. the estimation of proved reserves is controlled by
the corporation through long-standing approval guidelines. reserve changes are
made within a well-established, disciplined process driven by senior level
geoscience and engineering professionals, assisted by the reserves technical
oversight group which has significant technical experience, culminating in
reviews with and approval by senior management. notably, the corporation does
not use specific quantitative reserve targets to determine compensation. key
features of the reserve estimation process are covered in disclosure of
reserves in item2.
although the corporation is reasonably certain that
proved reserves will be produced, the timing and amount recovered can be
affected by a number of factors including completion of development projects,
reservoir performance, regulatory approvals and significant changes in
long-term oil and gas price levels.
proved reserves can be further subdivided into
developed and undeveloped reserves. the percentage of proved developed reserves
was 61 percent of total proved reserves at year-end 2012 (including both
consolidated and equity company reserves), and has been over 60 percent for the
last five years, indicating that proved reserves are consistently moved from
undeveloped to developed status.
revisions can include upward or downward changes in
previously estimated volumes of proved reserves for existing fields due to the
evaluation or re-evaluation of (1)already available geologic, reservoir
or production data, (2)new geologic, reservoir or production data or (3)changes
in prices and year-end costs that are used in the estimation of reserves.
revisions can also result from significant changes in development strategy or
production equipment/facility capacity.
impact
of oil and gas reserves on depreciation.
the calculation of unit-of-production depreciation is a critical accounting
estimate that measures the depreciation of upstream assets. it is the ratio of
actual volumes produced to total proved developed reserves (those proved
reserves recoverable through existing wells with existing equipment and
operating methods), applied to the asset cost. the volumes produced and asset
cost are known and, while proved developed reserves have a high probability of
recoverability, they are based on estimates that are subject to some
variability. while the revisions the corporation has made in the past are an
indicator of variability, they have had a very small impact on the
unit-of-production rates because they have been small compared to the large
reserves base.
impact
of oil and gas reserves and prices on testing for impairment. proved oil and gas properties held and used by the
corporation are reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances
indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable. assets are grouped
at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are
largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets.
the corporation estimates the future undiscounted cash
flows of the affected properties to judge the recoverability of carrying
amounts. impairment analyses are generally based on proved reserves. where
probable reserves exist, an appropriately risk-adjusted amount of these
reserves may be included in the impairment evaluation. an asset group would be
impaired if its undiscounted cash flows were less than the assets carrying
value. impairments are measured by the amount by which the carrying value
exceeds fair value.
significant unproved properties are assessed for
impairment individually, and valuation allowances against the capitalized costs
are recorded based on the estimated economic chance of success and the length
of time that the corporation expects to hold the properties. properties that
are not individually significant are aggregated by groups and amortized based
on development risk and average holding period.
managements discussion and analysis of financial
condition and results of operations
the corporation performs
asset valuation analyses on an ongoing basis as a part of its asset management
program. these analyses assist the corporation in assessing whether the
carrying amounts of any of its assets may not be recoverable. in addition to
estimating oil and gas reserve volumes in conducting these analyses, it is also
necessary to estimate future oil and gas prices. potential trigger events for
impairment evaluation include a significant decrease in current and projected
reserve volumes, an accumulation of project costs significantly in excess of
the amount originally expected, and current period operating losses combined
with a history and forecast of operating or cash flow losses.
in general, the corporation does not view temporarily
low prices or margins as a trigger event for conducting the impairment tests.
the markets for crude oil and natural gas have a history of significant price
volatility. although prices will occasionally drop significantly, industry
prices over the long term will continue to be driven by market supply and
demand. on the supply side, industry production from mature fields is
declining, but this is being offset by production from new discoveries and
field developments. opec production policies also have an impact on world oil
supplies. the demand side is largely a function of global economic growth. the
relative growth/decline in supply versus demand will determine industry prices
over the long term, and these cannot be accurately predicted.
accordingly, any impairment tests that the corporation
performs make use of the corporations price assumptions developed in the
annual planning and budgeting process for the crude oil and natural gas
markets, petroleum products and chemicals. these are the same price assumptions
that are used for capital investment decisions. volumes are based on field
production profiles, which are updated annually. cash flow estimates for
impairment testing exclude the effects of derivative instruments.
supplemental information regarding oil and gas results
of operations, capitalized costs and reserves is provided following the notes
to consolidated financial statements. future prices used for any impairment
tests will vary from the ones used in the supplemental oil and gas disclosure
and could be lower or higher for any given year.
asset retirement obligations
the
corporation incurs retirement obligations for certain assets. the fair values
of these obligations are recorded as liabilities on a discounted basis, which
is typically at the time the assets are installed. in the estimation of fair
value, the corporation uses assumptions and judgments regarding such factors as
the existence of a legal obligation for an asset retirement obligation;
technical assessments of the assets; estimated amounts and timing of
settlements; discount rates; and inflation rates. asset retirement obligations
are disclosed in note 9 to the financial statements.
suspended exploratory well costs
the
corporation continues capitalization of exploratory well costs when the well
has found a sufficient quantity of reserves to justify its completion as a
producing well and the corporation is making sufficient progress assessing the
reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project. exploratory
well costs not meeting these criteria are charged to expense. the facts and
circumstances that support continued capitalization of suspended wells as of
year-end 2012 are disclosed in note 10 to the financial statements.
consolidations
the
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of those subsidiaries
that the corporation controls. they also include the corporations share of the
undivided interest in certain upstream assets and liabilities. amounts representing
the corporations interest in the underlying net assets of other significant
entities that it does not control, but over which it exercises significant
influence, are accounted for using the equity method of accounting.
investments in companies that are partially owned by
the corporation are integral to the corporations operations. in some cases
they serve to balance worldwide risks, and in others they provide the only
available means of entry into a particular market or area of interest. the other
parties who also have an equity interest in these companies are either
independent third parties or host governments that share in the business
results according to their ownership. the corporation does not invest in these
companies in order to remove liabilities from its balance sheet. in fact, the
corporation has long been on record supporting an alternative accounting method
that would require each investor to consolidate its share of all assets and
liabilities in these partially owned companies rather than only its interest in
net equity. this method of accounting for investments in partially-owned
companies is not permitted by u.s. gaap except where the investments are in the
direct ownership of a share of upstream assets and liabilities. however, for
purposes of calculating return on average capital employed, which is not
covered by u.s. gaap standards, the corporation includes its share of debt of
these partially-owned companies in the determination of average capital
employed.
managements discussion and analysis of financial
condition and results of operations
pension benefits
the
corporation and its affiliates sponsor over 100 defined benefit (pension) plans
in about 50 countries. pension and other postretirement benefits (note 17)
provides details on pension obligations, fund assets and pension expense.
some of these plans (primarily non-u.s.) provide
pension benefits that are paid directly by their sponsoring affiliates out of
corporate cash flow rather than a separate pension fund. book reserves are
established for these plans because tax conventions and regulatory practices do
not encourage advance funding. the portion of the pension cost attributable to
employee service is expensed as services are rendered. the portion attributable
to the increase in pension obligations due to the passage of time is expensed
over the term of the obligations, which ends when all benefits are paid. the
primary difference in pension expense for unfunded versus funded plans is that
pension expense for funded plans also includes a credit for the expected
long-term return on fund assets.
for funded plans, including those in the u.s., pension
obligations are financed in advance through segregated assets or insurance
arrangements. these plans are managed in compliance with the requirements of
governmental authorities and meet or exceed required funding levels as measured
by relevant actuarial and government standards at the mandated measurement
dates. in determining liabilities and required contributions, these standards
often require approaches and assumptions that differ from those used for accounting
purposes.
the corporation will continue to make contributions to
these funded plans as necessary. all defined-benefit pension obligations,
regardless of the funding status of the underlying plans, are fully supported
by the financial strength of the corporation or the respective sponsoring
affiliate.
pension accounting requires explicit assumptions
regarding, among others, the long-term expected earnings rate on fund assets,
the discount rate for the benefit obligations and the long-term rate for future
salary increases. pension assumptions are reviewed annually by outside
actuaries and senior management. these assumptions are adjusted as appropriate
to reflect changes in market rates and outlook. the long-term expected earnings
rate on u.s. pension plan assets in 2012 was 7.25 percent. the 10year
and 20year actual returns on u.s. pension plan assets were both 9percent.
the corporation establishes the long-term expected rate of return by developing
a forward-looking, long-term return assumption for each pension fund asset
class, taking into account factors such as the expected real return for the
specific asset class and inflation. a single, long-term rate of return is then
calculated as the weighted average of the target asset allocation percentages and
the long-term return assumption for each asset class. a worldwide reduction of
0.5 percent in the long-term rate of return on assets would increase annual
pension expense by approximately $150 million before tax.
differences between actual returns on fund assets and
the long-term expected return are not recognized in pension expense in the year
that the difference occurs. such differences are deferred, along with other
actuarial gains and losses, and are amortized into pension expense over the
expected remaining service life of employees.
litigation contingencies
a
variety of claims have been made against the corporation and certain of its
consolidated subsidiaries in a number of pending lawsuits. management has
regular litigation reviews, including updates from corporate and outside
counsel, to assess the need for accounting recognition or disclosure of these
contingencies. the status of significant claims is summarized in note 16.
the corporation accrues an undiscounted liability for
those contingencies where the incurrence of a loss is probable, and the amount
can be reasonably estimated. these amounts are not reduced by amounts that may
be recovered under insurance or claims against third parties, but undiscounted
receivables from insurers or other third parties may be accrued separately. the
corporation revises such accruals in light of new information. for
contingencies where an unfavorable outcome is reasonably possible and which are
significant, the corporation discloses the nature of the contingency and, where
feasible, an estimate of the possible loss. for purposes of our litigation
contingency disclosures, significant includes material matters as well as
other items which management believes should be disclosed.
management judgment is required related to contingent
liabilities and the outcome of litigation because both are difficult to
predict. however, the corporation has been successful in defending litigation
in the past. payments have not had a material adverse effect on operations or financial
condition. in the corporations experience, large claims often do not result in
large awards. large awards are often reversed or substantially reduced as a
result of appeal or settlement.
tax contingencies
the
corporation is subject to income taxation in many jurisdictions around the
world. significant management judgment is required in the accounting for income
tax contingencies and tax disputes because the outcomes are often difficult to
predict.
the benefits of uncertain tax positions
that the corporation has taken or expects to take in its income tax returns are
recognized in the financial statements if management concludes that it is more
likely than not that the position will be sustained
managements discussion and analysis of financial
condition and results of operations
with
the tax authorities. for a position that is likely to be sustained, the benefit
recognized in the financial statements is measured at the largest amount that
is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized. a reserve is established
for the difference between a position taken or expected to be taken in an
income tax return and the amount recognized in the financial statements. the
corporations unrecognized tax benefits and a description of open tax years are
summarized in note 19.
foreign currency translation
the
method of translating the foreign currency financial statements ofthe
corporations international subsidiaries into u.s. dollars is prescribed by
gaap. under these principles, it is necessary to select the functional currency
of these subsidiaries. the functional currency is the currency of the primary
economic environment in which the subsidiary operates. management selects the
functional currency after evaluating this economic environment.
factors considered by management when determining the
functional currency for a subsidiary include the currency used for cash flows
related to individual assets and liabilities; the responsiveness of sales
prices to changes in exchange rates; the history of inflation in the country;
whether sales are into local markets or exported; the currency used to acquire
raw materials, labor, services and supplies; sources of financing; and
significance of intercompany transactions.
managements report on internal control over financial
reporting
management, including the corporations chief
executive officer, principal financial officer, and principal accounting
officer, is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal
control over the corporations financial reporting. management conducted an
evaluation of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting
based on criteria established in internal control integrated
framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the
treadway commission. based on this evaluation, management concluded that exxon
mobil corporations internal control over financial reporting was effective as
of december31, 2012.
pricewaterhousecoopers llp, an independent registered
public accounting firm, audited the effectiveness of the corporations internal
control over financial reporting as of december31, 2012, as stated in
their report included in the financial section of this report.

to the shareholders of exxon mobil
corporation:
in our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance
sheets and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income,
changes in equity and cash flows present fairly, in all material respects, the
financial position of exxon mobil corporation and its subsidiaries at
december31, 2012, and 2011, and the results of their operations and their
cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended december31,
2012, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united
states of america. also in our opinion, the corporation maintained, in all
material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of
december31, 2012, based on criteria established in internal control
integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of
the treadway commission (coso). the corporations management is responsible for
these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over
financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal
control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying managements
report on internal control over financial reporting. our responsibility is to
express opinions on these financial statements and on the corporations
internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits. we
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the public company
accounting oversight board (united states). those standards require that we
plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective
internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material
respects. our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test
basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an
understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk
that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and
operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. our
audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered
necessary in the circumstances. we believe that our audits provide a reasonable
basis for our opinions.
a companys internal control over financial reporting
is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability
of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external
purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. a
companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and
procedures that (i)pertain to the maintenance of records that, in
reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and
dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii)provide reasonable
assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made
only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the
company; and (iii)provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or
timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
because of its inherent limitations, internal control
over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. also,
projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to
the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions,
or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may
deteriorate.

notes to consolidated financial statements
the accompanying consolidated financial statements and
the supporting and supplemental material are the responsibility of the
management of exxon mobil corporation.
the corporations principal business is energy,
involving the worldwide exploration, production, transportation and sale of
crude oil and natural gas (upstream) and the manufacture, transportation and
sale of petroleum products (downstream). the corporation is also a major
worldwide manufacturer and marketer of petrochemicals (chemical) and
participates in electric power generation (upstream).
the preparation of financial statements in conformity
with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles (gaap) requires management
to make estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities,
revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities.
actual results could differ from these estimates. prior years data has been
reclassified in certain cases to conform to the 2012 presentation basis.
1. summary of accounting policies
principles
of consolidation. the consolidated
financial statements include the accounts of subsidiaries the corporation
controls. they also include the corporations share of the undivided interest
in certain upstream assets and liabilities.
amounts representing the corporations interest in
entities that it does not control, but over which it exercises significant
influence, are included in investments, advances and long-term receivables.
the corporations share of the net income of these companies is included in the
consolidated statement of income caption income from equity affiliates.
majority ownership is normally the indicator of
control that is the basis on which subsidiaries are consolidated. however,
certain factors may indicate that a majority-owned investment is not controlled
and therefore should be accounted for using the equity method of accounting.
these factors occur where the minority shareholders are granted by law or by
contract substantive participating rights. these include the right to approve
operating policies, expense budgets, financing and investment plans, and
management compensation and succession plans.
the corporations share of the cumulative foreign
exchange translation adjustment for equity method investments is reported in accumulated
other comprehensive income.
evidence of loss in value that might indicate
impairment of investments in companies accounted for on the equity method is
assessed to determine if such evidence represents a loss in value of the
corporations investment that is other than temporary. examples of key
indicators include a history of operating losses, a negative earnings and cash
flow outlook, significant downward revisions to oil and gas reserves, and the
financial condition and prospects for the investees business segment or
geographic region. if evidence of an other than temporary loss in fair value
below carrying amount is determined, an impairment is recognized. in the
absence of market prices for the investment, discounted cash flows are used to
assess fair value.
revenue
recognition. the corporation
generally sells crude oil, natural gas and petroleum and chemical products
under short-term agreements at prevailing market prices. in some cases (e.g.,
natural gas), products may be sold under long-term agreements, with periodic
price adjustments. revenues are recognized when the products are delivered,
which occurs when the customer has taken title and has assumed the risks and
rewards of ownership, prices are fixed or determinable and collectibility is
reasonably assured.
revenues from the production of natural gas properties
in which the corporation has an interest with other producers are recognized on
the basis of the corporations net working interest. differences between actual
production and net working interest volumes are not significant.
purchases and sales of inventory with the same
counterparty that are entered into in contemplation of one another are combined
and recorded as exchanges measured at the book value of the item sold.
sales-based
taxes. the corporation reports sales,
excise and value-added taxes on sales transactions on a gross basis in the
consolidated statement of income (included in both revenues and costs).
derivative
instruments. the corporation makes
limited use of derivative instruments. the corporation does not engage in
speculative derivative activities or derivative trading activities, nor does it
use derivatives with leveraged features. when the corporation does enter into
derivative transactions, it is to offset exposures associated with interest
rates, foreign currency exchange rates and hydrocarbon prices that arise from
existing assets, liabilities and forecasted transactions.
the gains and losses resulting from changes in the
fair value of derivatives are recorded in income. in some cases, the
corporation designates derivatives as fair value hedges, in which case the
gains and losses are offset in income by the gains and losses arising from
changes in the fair value of the underlying hedged item.
fair
value. fair value is the price that
would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an
orderly transaction between market participants. hierarchy levels 1, 2 and 3
are terms for the priority of inputs to valuation techniques used to measure
fair value. hierarchy level 1 inputs are quoted prices in active markets for
identical assets or liabilities. hierarchy
notes to consolidated financial statements
level2
inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included within level1 that
are directly or indirectly observable for the asset or liability. hierarchy
level3 inputs are inputs that are not observable in the market.
inventories.
crude oil, products and merchandise
inventories are carried at the lower of current market value or cost (generally
determined under the last-in, first-out method  lifo). inventory costs include
expenditures and other charges (including depreciation) directly and indirectly
incurred in bringing the inventory to its existing condition and location.
selling expenses and general and administrative expenses are reported as period
costs and excluded from inventory cost. inventories of materials and supplies
are valued at cost or less.
property,
plant and equipment. depreciation,
depletion and amortization, based on cost less estimated salvage value of the
asset, are primarily determined under either the unit-of-production method or
the straight-line method, which is based on estimated asset service life taking
obsolescence into consideration. maintenance and repairs, including planned
major maintenance, are expensed as incurred. major renewals and improvements
are capitalized and the assets replaced are retired.
interest costs incurred to finance expenditures during
the construction phase of multiyear projects are capitalized as part of the
historical cost of acquiring the constructed assets. the project construction
phase commences with the development of the detailed engineering design and
ends when the constructed assets are ready for their intended use. capitalized
interest costs are included in property, plant and equipment and are
depreciated over the service life of the related assets.
the corporation uses the successful efforts method
to account for its exploration and production activities. under this method,
costs are accumulated on a field-by-field basis with certain exploratory
expenditures and exploratory dry holes being expensed as incurred. costs of
productive wells and development dry holes are capitalized and amortized on the
unit-of-production method.
the corporation carries as an asset exploratory well
costs when the well has found a sufficient quantity of reserves to justify its
completion as a producing well and where the corporation is making sufficient progress
assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project.
exploratory well costs not meeting these criteria are charged to expense. other
exploratory expenditures, including geophysical costs and annual lease rentals,
are expensed as incurred.
acquisition costs of proved properties are amortized
using a unit-of-production method, computed on the basis of total proved oil
and gas reserves.
capitalized exploratory drilling and development costs
associated with productive depletable extractive properties are amortized using
unit-of-production rates based on the amount of proved developed reserves of
oil, gas and other minerals that are estimated to be recoverable from existing
facilities using current operating methods.
under the unit-of-production method, oil and gas
volumes are considered produced once they have been measured through meters at
custody transfer or sales transaction points at the outlet valve on the lease
or field storage tank.
production costs are expensed as incurred. production
involves lifting the oil and gas to the surface and gathering, treating, field
processing and field storage of the oil and gas. the production function
normally terminates at the outlet valve on the lease or field production
storage tank. production costs are those incurred to operate and maintain the
corporations wells and related equipment and facilities. they become part of
the cost of oil and gas produced. these costs, sometimes referred to as lifting
costs, include such items as labor costs to operate the wells and related
equipment; repair and maintenance costs on the wells and equipment; materials,
supplies and energy costs required to operate the wells and related equipment;
and administrative expenses related to the production activity.
proved oil and gas properties held and used by the
corporation are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable. assets
are grouped at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows
that are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets.
the corporation estimates the future undiscounted cash
flows of the affected properties to judge the recoverability of carrying
amounts. cash flows used in impairment evaluations are developed using annually
updated corporate plan investment evaluation assumptions for crude oil
commodity prices, refining and chemical margins and foreign currency exchange
rates. annual volumes are based on field production profiles, which are also
updated annually. prices for natural gas and other products are based on
corporate plan assumptions developed annually by major region and also for
investment evaluation purposes. cash flow estimates for impairment testing exclude
derivative instruments.
impairment analyses are generally based on proved
reserves. where probable reserves exist, an appropriately risk-adjusted amount
of these reserves may be included in the impairment evaluation. an asset group
would be impaired if the undiscounted cash flows were less than its carrying
value. impairments are measured by the amount the carrying value exceeds fair
value.
significant unproved properties are assessed for
impairment individually, and valuation allowances against the capitalized costs
are recorded based on the estimated economic chance of success and the length
of time that the corporation expects to hold the properties. properties that
are not individually significant are aggregated by groups and amortized based
on development risk and average holding period. the valuation allowances are
reviewed at least annually.
notes to consolidated financial statements
gains on sales of proved
and unproved properties are only recognized when there is neither uncertainty
about the recovery of costs applicable to any interest retained nor any
substantial obligation for future performance by the corporation.
losses on properties sold are recognized when incurred
or when the properties are held for sale and the fair value of the properties
is less than the carrying value.
asset
retirement obligations and environmental liabilities. thecorporation incurs retirement obligations for
certain assets. the fair values of these obligations are recorded as
liabilities on a discounted basis, which is typically at the time the assets
are installed. the costs associated with these liabilities are capitalized as
part of the related assets and depreciated. over time, the liabilities are
accreted for the change in their present value.
liabilities for environmental costs are recorded when
it is probable that obligations have been incurred and the amounts can be
reasonably estimated. these liabilities are not reduced by possible recoveries
from third parties and projected cash expenditures are not discounted.
foreign
currency translation. the corporation
selects the functional reporting currency for its international subsidiaries
based on the currency of the primary economic environment in which each
subsidiary operates.
downstream and chemical operations primarily use the
local currency. however, the u.s. dollar is used in countries with a history of
high inflation (primarily in latin america) and singapore, which predominantly
sells into the u.s. dollar export market. upstream operations which are
relatively self-contained and integrated within a particular country, such as
canada, the united kingdom, norway and continental europe, use the local
currency. some upstream operations, primarily in asia and africa, use the u.s.
dollar because they predominantly sell crude and natural gas production into
u.s. dollar-denominated markets.
for all operations, gains or losses from remeasuring
foreign currency transactions into the functional currency are included in
income.
stock-based
payments. the corporation awards
stock-based compensation to employees in the form of restricted stock and
restricted stock units. compensation expense is measured by the market price of
the restricted shares at the date of grant and is recognized in the income
statement over the requisite service period of each award. see note 15,
incentive program, for further details.
2. accounting changes
the
corporation did not adopt authoritative guidance in 2012 that had a material
impact on the corporations financial statements.
3. miscellaneous financial information
research
and development expenses totaled $1,042 million in 2012, $1,044 million in 2011
and $1,012 million in 2010.
net income included before-tax aggregate foreign
exchange transaction gains of $159 million, and losses of $184 million and $251
million in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
in 2012, 2011 and 2010, net income included gains of $328
million, $292 million and $317 million, respectively, attributable to the
combined effects of lifo inventory accumulations and drawdowns. the aggregate
replacement cost of inventories was estimated to exceed their lifo carrying
values by $21.3 billion and $25.6 billion at december31, 2012, and 2011,
respectively.

5. cash flow information
the
consolidated statement of cash flows provides information about changes in cash
and cash equivalents. highly liquid investments with maturities of three months
or less when acquired are classified as cash equivalents.
the net (gain) on asset sales in net cash provided
by operating activities on the consolidated statement of cash flows includes
before-tax gains from the japan restructuring, the sale of an upstream property
in angola, exchanges of upstream properties, the sale of u.s. service stations,
and the sale of the downstream affiliates in malaysia and switzerland in 2012;
from the sale of some upstream canadian, u.k. and other producing properties
and assets, and the sale of u.s. service stations in 2011; and from the sale of
some upstream gulf of mexico and other producing properties, the sale of u.s.
service stations and other downstream assets and investments and the formation
of a chemical joint venture in 2010. these gains are reported in other income
on the consolidated statement of income.
in 2012, the corporations interest in a cost company
was redeemed. as part of the redemption, a variable note due in 2035 issued by
mobil services (bahamas) ltd. was assigned to a consolidated exxonmobil
affiliate. this note is no longer classified as third party long-term debt.
this assignment did not result in a reduction in long-term debt on the
statement of cash flows.
in 2012, exxonmobil completed asset exchanges,
primarily noncash transactions, of approximately $1 billion. this amount is
not included in the sales of subsidiaries, investments, and property, plant
and equipment or the additions to property, plant and equipment lines on the
statement of cash flows.
in 2011, included in proceeds associated with sales
of subsidiaries, property, plant and equipment, and sales and returns of
investments is a $3.6 billion deposit for an asset that was sold in 2012.
in 2010, the corporation acquired all the outstanding
equity of xto energy inc. in an all-stock transaction valued at $24,659 million.

7. equity company
information
the
summarized financial information below includes amounts related to certain
less-than-majority-owned companies and majority-owned subsidiaries where
minority shareholders possess the right to participate in significant
management decisions (see note 1). thesecompanies are primarily engaged
in crude production, natural gas production, natural gas marketing and refining
operations in north america; natural gas production, natural gas distribution
and downstream operations in europe; refining operations, petrochemical
manufacturing, fuel sales and power generation in asia; crude production in
kazakhstan; and liquefied natural gas (lng) operations in qatar. also included
are several refining, petrochemical manufacturing and chemical ventures.
thecorporations ownership in these ventures is in the form of shares in
corporate joint ventures as well as interests in partnerships. differences between the companys carrying value of an equity
investment and its underlying equity in the net assets of the affiliate are
assigned to the extent practicable to specific assets and liabilities based on
the companys analysis of the factors giving rise to the difference. the
amortization of this difference, as appropriate, is included in income from
equity affiliates. the shareof total
equity company revenues from sales to exxonmobil consolidated companies was 16
percent, 19 percent and 18 percent in the years 2012, 2011 and 2010,
respectively.

in the
upstream segment, depreciation is generally on a unit-of-production basis, so
depreciable life will vary by field. in the downstream segment, investments in
refinery and lubes basestock manufacturing facilities are generally depreciated
on a straight-line basis over a 25-year life and service station buildings and
fixed improvements over a 20-year life. in the chemical segment, investments in
process equipment are generally depreciated on a straight-line basis over a
20-year life.
accumulated depreciation and depletion totaled $182,365
million at the end of 2012 and $179,331 million at the end of 2011. interest
capitalized in 2012, 2011 and 2010 was $506 million, $593 million and $532
million, respectively.
notes to consolidated financial statements
asset retirement obligations
the
corporation incurs retirement obligations for certain assets. the fair values
of these obligations are recorded as liabilities on a discounted basis, which
is typically at the time the assets are installed. in the estimation of fair
value, the corporation uses assumptions and judgments regarding such factors as
the existence of a legal obligation for an asset retirement obligation;
technical assessments of the assets; estimated amounts and timing of settlements;
discount rates; and inflation rates. asset retirement obligations incurred in
the current period were level 3 (unobservable inputs) fair value measurements.
the costs associated with these liabilities are capitalized as part of the
related assets and depreciated as the reserves are produced. over time, the
liabilities are accreted for the change in their present value.
asset retirement obligations for downstream and
chemical facilities generally become firm at the time the facilities are
permanently shut down and dismantled. these obligations may include the costs
of asset disposal and additional soil remediation. however, these sites have
indeterminate lives based on plans for continued operations and as such, the
fair value of the conditional legal obligations cannot be measured, since it is
impossible to estimate the future settlement dates of such obligations.

10. accounting for
suspended exploratory well costs
the
corporation continues capitalization of exploratory well costs whenthe
well has found a sufficient quantity of reserves to justify its completion as a
producing well and the corporationis making sufficient progress assessing
the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project. the term
project as used in this report does not necessarily have the same meaning as
under sec rule 13q-1 relating to government payment reporting. for example, a
single project for purposes of the rule may encompass numerous properties,
agreements, investments, developments, phases, work efforts, activities, and
components, each of which we may also informally describe as a project.
the following two tables provide details of the
changes in the balance of suspended exploratory well costs as well as an aging
summary of those costs.

13. financial
instruments and derivatives
financial
instruments. the fair value of
financial instruments is determined by reference to observable market data and
other valuation techniques as appropriate. the only category of financial
instruments where the difference between fair value and recorded book value is
notable is long-term debt. the estimated fair value of total long-term debt,
including capitalized lease obligations, was $8.5 billion and $9.8 billion at
december 31, 2012, and 2011, respectively, as compared to recorded book values
of $7.9 billion and $9.3 billion at december 31, 2012, and 2011, respectively. the
fair value of long-term debt by hierarchy level at december 31, 2012 is shown
below:
as of december 31, 2012
level 1
level 2
level 3
total
(millions of dollars)
long-term debt
fair value
6,482
1,480
8,458
the
fair value hierarchy for long-term debt is primarily level 1 and represents
quoted prices in active markets. level 2 includes debt whose fair value is
based upon a publicly available index. the level 3 amount is primarily
capitalized leases whose value is typically determined through the use of
present value and specific contract terms.
derivative
instruments. the corporations size,
strong capital structure, geographic diversity and the complementary nature of
the upstream, downstream and chemical businesses reduce the corporations
enterprise-wide risk from changes in interest rates, currency rates and
commodity prices. as a result, the corporation makes limited use of derivatives
to mitigate the impact of such changes. the corporation does not engage in
speculative derivative activities or derivative trading activities nor does it
use derivatives with leveraged features. when the corporation does enter into
derivative transactions, it is to offset exposures associated with interest
rates, foreign currency exchange rates and hydrocarbon prices that arise from
existing assets, liabilities and forecasted transactions.
the estimated fair value of derivative instruments
outstanding and recorded on the balance sheet was a net asset of $2 million at
year-end 2012 and a net liability of $3 million at year-end 2011. assets and
liabilities associated with derivatives are usually recorded either in other
current assets or accounts payable and accrued liabilities.
the corporations fair value measurement of its
derivative instruments use either level 1 (observable quoted prices on active
exchanges) or level 2 (derivatives that are determined by either market prices
on an active market for similar assets or by prices quoted by a broker or other
market-corroborated prices) inputs.
the corporation recognized a before-tax gain or (loss)
related to derivative instruments of $(23) million, $131 million and $221million
during 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. income statement effects associated
with derivatives are usually recorded either in sales and other operating revenue
or crude oil and product purchases.
the corporation believes there are no material market
or credit risks to the corporations financial position, results of operations
or liquidity as a result of the derivative activities described above.

14. long-term debt
at
december31, 2012, long-term debt consisted of $7,325 million due
inu.s. dollars and $603 million representing the u.s. dollar equivalent
at year-end exchange rates of amounts payable in foreign currencies. these
amounts exclude that portion of long-term debt, totaling $1,025 million, which
matures within one year and is included in current liabilities. the amounts of
long-term debt maturing in each of the four years after december31, 2013,
in millions of dollars, are: 2014  $907; 2015$710; 2016  $454;

15. incentive program
the 2003 incentive program provides for grants of
stock options, stock appreciation rights (sars), restricted stock and other
forms of award. awards may be granted to eligible employees of the corporation
and those affiliates at least 50 percent owned. outstanding awards are subject
to certain forfeiture provisions contained in the program or award instrument.
options and sars may be granted at prices not less than 100 percent of market
value on the date of grant and have a maximum life of 10 years. the maximum
number of shares of stock that may be issued under the 2003 incentive program
is 220 million. awards that are forfeited, expire or are settled in cash, do
not count against this maximum limit. the 2003 incentive program does not have
a specified term. new awards may be made until the available shares are
depleted, unless the board terminates the plan early. at the end of 2012,
remaining shares available for award under the 2003 incentive program were 124,736
thousand.
restricted
stock. awards totaling 10,017thousand,
10,533 thousand, and 10,648 thousand (excluding xto merger-related grants) of
restricted (nonvested) common stock and restricted (nonvested) common stock
units were granted in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. compensation expense
for these awards is based on the price of the stock at the date of grant and is
recognized in income over the requisite service period. these shares are issued
to employees from treasury stock. the units that are settled in cash are
recorded as liabilities and their changes in fair value are recognized over the
vesting period. during the applicable restricted periods, the shares may not be
sold or transferred and are subject to forfeiture. the majority of the awards
have graded vesting periods, with 50 percent of the shares in each award
vesting after three years and the remaining 50 percent vesting after seven
years. awards granted to a small number of senior executives have vesting
periods of five years for 50 percent of the award and of 10 years or
retirement, whichever occurs later, for the remaining 50 percent of the award.
additionally, in 2010 long-term incentive awards
totaling 4,206 thousand shares of restricted (nonvested) common stock, with a
value of $250 million, were granted in association with the xto merger. the
majority of these awards vest over periods of up to three years after the
initial grant.
the corporation has purchased shares in the open
market and through negotiated transactions to offset shares issued in
conjunction with benefit plans and programs. purchases may be discontinued at
any time without prior notice.

stock options. the
corporation has not granted any stock options under the 2003 incentive program
and all stock options granted under the prior program were exercised by the end
of 2011. in 2010, the corporation granted 12,393 thousand of converted xto
stock options with a grant-date fair value of $182 million as a result of the
xto merger. these stock options generally vest and become exercisable ratably
over a three-year period, and may include a provision for accelerated vesting
when the common stock price reaches specified levels. some stock option
tranches vest only when the common stock price reaches specified levels. there

16. litigation and other
contingencies
litigation.
a variety of claims have been made
against exxonmobil and certain of its consolidated subsidiaries in a number of
pending lawsuits. management has regular litigation reviews, including updates
from corporate and outside counsel, to assess the need for accounting
recognition or disclosure of these contingencies. the corporation accrues an
undiscounted liability for those contingencies where the incurrence of a loss
is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. if a range of amounts
can be reasonably estimated and no amount within the range is a better estimate
than any other amount, then the minimum of the range is accrued. the
corporation does not record liabilities when the likelihood that the liability
has been incurred is probable but the amount cannot be reasonably estimated or
when the liability is believed to be only reasonably possible or remote. for
contingencies where an unfavorable outcome is reasonably possible and which are
significant, the corporation discloses the nature of the contingency and, where
feasible, an estimate of the possible loss. for purposes of our contingency
disclosures, significant includes material matters as well as other matters
which management believes should be disclosed. exxonmobil will continue to
defend itself vigorously in these matters. based on a consideration of all
relevant facts and circumstances, the corporation does not believe the ultimate
outcome of any currently pending lawsuit against exxonmobil will have a material
adverse effect upon the corporations operations, financial condition, or
financial statements taken as a whole.
on june 30, 2011, a state district court jury in
baltimore county, maryland returned a verdict against exxon mobil corporation
in allison, et al v. exxon mobil corporation, a case involving an
accidental 26,000 gallon gasoline leak at a suburban baltimore service station.
the verdict included approximately $497 million in compensatory damages and
approximately $1.0 billion in punitive damages in a finding that exxonmobil
fraudulently misled the plaintiff-residents about the events leading up to the
leak, the leaks discovery, and the nature and extent of any groundwater
contamination. exxonmobil believes the verdict is not justified by the evidence
and that the amount of the compensatory award is grossly excessive and the
imposition of punitive damages is improper and unconstitutional. the trial
court denied a post-trial motion that exxonmobil filed to overturn the punitive
damages verdict and entered a final judgment in the amount of $1,488 million.
exxonmobil appealed the verdict and judgment. in a prior trial involving the
same leak and different plaintiffs, the jury awarded compensatory damages but rejected
the plaintiffs punitive damage claims. those plaintiffs did not appeal the
jurys denial of punitive damages. on
february9, 2012, the maryland court of special appeals reversed in part
and affirmed in part the trial court's decision on compensatory damages in that
case. the maryland court of appeals granted writs of certiorari to both parties
in response to their separate petitions seeking reversals of portions of the
court of special appeals' decision. the appeals in both of these cases were
consolidated before the maryland court of appeals and arguments were held on
november 5, 2012. on february 26, 2013, the maryland court of appeals issued
its opinion in the consolidated appeal. the court unanimously reversed the
fraud and punitive damages judgment, and also reversed a majority of the compensatory
damage claims. the court remanded a limited number of claims related to alleged
property damage for a new trial.
other
contingencies. the corporation and
certain of its consolidated subsidiaries were contingently liable at december
31, 2012, for guarantees relating to notes, loans and performance under
contracts. where guarantees for environmental remediation and other similar
matters do not include a stated cap, the amounts reflect managements estimate
of the maximum potential exposure.

additionally, the corporation and its
affiliates have numerous long-term sales and purchase commitments in their
various business activities, all of which are expected to be fulfilled with no
adverse consequences material to the corporations operations or financial
condition. unconditional purchase obligations as defined by accounting
standards are those long-term commitments that are noncancelable or cancelable
only under certain conditions, and that third parties have used to secure
financing for the facilities that will provide the contracted goods or

in
accordance with a nationalization decree issued by venezuelas president in
february 2007, by may 1, 2007, a subsidiary of the venezuelan national oil
company (pdvsa) assumed the operatorship of the cerro negro heavy oil project.
this project had been operated and owned by exxonmobil affiliates holding a
41.67 percent ownership interest in the project. the decree also required
conversion of the cerro negro project into a mixed enterprise and an increase
in pdvsas or one of its affiliates ownership interest in the project, with
the stipulation that if exxonmobil refused to accept the terms for the
formation of the mixed enterprise within a specified period of time, the
government would directly assume the activities carried out by the joint
venture. exxonmobil refused to accede to the terms proffered by the government,
and on june 27, 2007, the government expropriated exxonmobils 41.67 percent
interest in the cerro negro project. exxonmobils remaining net book investment
in cerro negro producing assets is about $750 million.
on september 6, 2007, affiliates of exxonmobil filed a
request for arbitration with the international centre for settlement of
investment disputes (icsid) invoking icsid jurisdiction under venezuelas
investment law and the netherlands-venezuela bilateral investment treaty. the
icsid tribunal issued a decision on june 10, 2010, finding that it had
jurisdiction to proceed on the basis of the netherlands-venezuela bilateral
investment treaty. the icsid arbitration proceeding is continuing and a hearing
on the merits was held in february 2012. at this time, the net impact of these
matters on the corporations consolidated financial results cannot be
reasonably estimated. regardless, the corporation does not expect the
resolution to have a material effect upon the corporations operations or
financial condition.
an affiliate of exxonmobil is one of the contractors
under a production sharing contract (psc) with the nigerian national petroleum
corporation (nnpc) covering the erha block located in the offshore waters of
nigeria.exxonmobils affiliate is the operator of the block and owns a
56.25 percent interest under the psc.the contractors are in dispute with
nnpc regarding nnpcs lifting of crude oil in excess of its entitlement under
the terms of the psc.in accordance with the terms of the psc, the
contractors initiated arbitration in abuja, nigeria, under the nigerian
arbitration and conciliation act.on october 24, 2011, a three-member
arbitral tribunal issued an award upholding the contractors position in all
material respects and awarding damages to the contractors jointly in an amount
of approximately $1.8 billion plus $234 million in accrued interest. the
contractors petitioned a nigerian federal court for enforcement of the award,
and nnpc petitioned the same court to have the award set aside.on may 22, 2012, the court set aside the
award. the contractors have appealed that judgment.at this time, the net impact of this matter on
the corporations consolidated financial results cannot be reasonably
estimated.however, regardless of the outcome of enforcement proceedings,
the corporation does not expect the proceedings to have a material effect upon
the corporations operations or financial condition.

for
u.s. plans, the discount rate is determined by constructing a portfolio of
high-quality, noncallable bonds with cash flows that match estimated outflows
for benefit payments. for major non-u.s. plans, the discount rateis
determined by using bond portfolios with an average maturity approximating that
of the liabilities or spot yield curves, both of which areconstructed
using high-quality, local-currency-denominated bonds.
the measurement of the accumulated
postretirement benefit obligation assumes an initial health care cost trend
rate of 5.0 percent that declines to 4.5 percent by 2015. a
one-percentage-point increase in thehealth care cost trend rate would
increase service and interest cost by $74 million and the postretirement
benefit obligation by $871 million. a one-percentage-point decrease in the
health care cost trend rate would decrease service and interest cost by $57
million and the postretirement benefit obligation by $700 million.

the long-term expected rate of return on
funded assets shown below is established for each benefit plan by developing a
forward-looking, long-term return assumption for each asset class, taking into
account factorssuch as the expected real return for the specific asset
class and inflation. a single, long-term rate of return is then calculated as
the weighted average of the target asset allocation percentages and the
long-term return assumption for each asset class.

the
corporations investment strategy for benefit plan assets reflects along-term
view, a careful assessment of the risks inherent in various asset classes and
broad diversification to reduce the risk of the portfolio. the benefit plan
assets are primarily invested in passive equity and fixedincome index
funds to diversify risk while minimizing costs. the equity funds hold
exxonmobil stock only to the extent necessary to replicate the relevant equity
index. the fixed income funds are largely invested in high-quality corporate
and government debt securities.
studies are periodically conducted to establish the
preferred target asset allocation percentages. the target asset allocation for
the u.s. benefit plans is 50 percent equity securities and 50 percent debt
securities. the target asset allocation for the non-u.s. plans in aggregate is 50
percent equity securities and 50 percent debt securities. the equity targets
for the u.s. and non-u.s. plans include an allocation to private equity
partnerships that primarily focus on early-stage venture capital of 5 percent
and 3 percent, respectively.
the fair value measurement levels are accounting terms
that refer to different methods of valuing assets. the terms do not represent
the relative risk or credit quality of an investment.

disclosures about segments and related information
the
upstream, downstream and chemical functions best define the operating segments
of the business that are reported separately. the factors used to identify
these reportable segments are based on the nature of the operations that are
undertaken by each segment. the upstream segment is organized and operates to
explore for and produce crude oil and natural gas. the downstream segment is
organized and operates to manufacture and sell petroleum products. the chemical
segment is organized and operates to manufacture and sell petrochemicals. these
segments are broadly understood across the petroleum and petrochemical
industries.
these functions have been defined as the operating
segments of the corporation because they are the segments (1)that engage
in business activities from which revenues are earned and expenses are
incurred; (2)whose operating results are regularly reviewed by the
corporations chief operating decision maker to make decisions about resources
to be allocated to the segment and assess its performance; and (3)for
which discrete financial information is available.
earnings after income tax include transfers at
estimated market prices.
notes to consolidated financial statements
in corporate and financing
activities, interest revenue relates to interest earned on cash deposits and
marketable securities. interest expense includes non-debt-related interest
expense of $202 million, $165 million and $41 million in 2012, 2011 and 2010,
respectively.

the
corporation had $43billion of indefinitely reinvested, undistributed
earnings from subsidiary companies outside the u.s. unrecognized deferred taxes
on remittance of these funds are not expected to be material.
notes to consolidated financial statements
unrecognized tax benefits. the corporation is subject to income taxation in many
jurisdictions around the world. unrecognized tax benefits reflect the
difference between positions taken or expected to be taken on income tax
returns and the amounts recognized in the financial statements. resolution of
the related tax positions through negotiations with the relevant tax
authorities or through litigation will take many years to complete. it is
difficult to predict the timing of resolution for tax positions since such
timing is not entirely within the control of the corporation. it is reasonably
possible that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits could increase by up
to 25percent in the next 12 months, with no material impact on near-term
earnings. given the long time periods involved in resolving tax positions, the
corporation does not expect that the recognition of unrecognized tax benefits
will have a material impact on the corporations effective income tax rate in
any given year.

unrecognized tax benefits.

the
additions and reductions in unrecognized tax benefits shown above include
effects related to net income and equity, and timing differences for which the
ultimate deductibility is highly certain but for which there is uncertainty
about the timing of such deductibility. the 2012, 2011 and 2010 changes in
unrecognized tax benefits did not have a material effect on the corporations
net income or cash flow.

the
corporation classifies interest on income tax-related balances as interest
expense or interest income and classifies tax-related penalties as operating
expense.
the corporation incurred $46 million and $62 million in
interest expense on income tax reserves in 2012 and 2011, respectively. for
2010, interest expense was a credit of $39 million, reflecting the effect of
credits from the net favorable resolution of prior year tax positions. the
related interest payable balances were $385 million and $662 million at december31,
2012, and 2011, respectively.
notes to consolidated financial statements
20. japan
restructuring
on june 1, 2012, the corporation
completed the restructuring of its downstream and chemical holdings in
japan.under the restructuring, tonengeneral
sekiyuk.k.(tg), a consolidated subsidiary owned 50 percent by
the corporation, purchased for $3.9 billion the corporations shares of a
wholly-owned affiliate in japan, emg marketing godo kaisha (previously known as
exxonmobil yugen kaisha), which resulted in tg acquiring approximately 200million
of its shares owned by the corporation along with other assets. as a result of
the restructuring, the corporations effective ownership of tg was reduced to
approximately 22 percent and a net gain of $6.5 billion was recognized.
the gain is included in other income partially offset by amounts included in
income taxes and net income attributable to noncontrolling interests.
the gain includes
$1.9 billion of the corporations share of other comprehensive income recycled
into earnings (see note 1 below). the gain also includes remeasurement of tgs
shares that the corporation continues to own to $0.7 billion, based on tgs
share price on the tokyo stock exchange. the corporation accounts for its
remaining investment using the equity method.

the
accumulated other comprehensive income associated with the japan restructuring
was recycled into earnings. at june1,2012, exxonmobils share of
accumulated other comprehensive income was a benefit of $1.9 billion, including $2.5 billion
related to cumulative translation adjustments offset by $0.6 billion related to
postretirement benefits reserves adjustments.
supplemental
information on oil and gas exploration and production activities (unaudited)
the results of operations for producing activities
shown below do not include earnings from other activities that exxonmobil
includes in the upstream function, such as oil and gas transportation
operations, lng liquefaction and transportation operations, coal and power
operations, technical service agreements, other nonoperating activities and
adjustments for noncontrolling interests. these excluded amounts for both
consolidated and equity companies totaled $2,832 million in 2012, $2,600
million in 2011, and $249 million in 2010. oil sands mining operations are
included in the results of operations in accordance with securities and

the amounts shown for net capitalized costs of consolidated
subsidiaries are $10,643 million less at year-end 2012 and $6,651 million less
at year-end 2011 than the amounts reported as investments in property, plant
and equipment for the upstream in note 9. this is due tothe exclusion
from capitalized costs of certain transportation and research assets and assets
relating to lng operations. assets related tooil sands and oil shale
mining operations have been included in the capitalized costs for 2012 and 2011
in accordance with financial accounting standards board rules.

the
amounts reported as costs incurred include both capitalized costs and costs charged
to expense during the year. costs incurred also include new asset retirement
obligations established in the current year, as well as increases or decreases
to the asset retirement obligation resulting from changes in cost estimates or
abandonment date. total consolidated costs incurred in 2012 were $31,146
million, up $392 million from 2011, due primarily to higher exploration and
development costs partially offset by lower property acquisition costs. 2011
costs were $30,754 million, down $40,058 million from 2010, due primarily to
the absence of the acquisition of xto energy inc. total equity company costs
incurred in 2012 were $1,404 million, up $178 million from 2011, due primarily
to higher development costs.

oil and gas reserves
the following information describes changes during the
years and balances of proved oil and gas reserves at year-end 2010, 2011, and
2012.
the definitions used are in accordance with the
securities and exchange commissions rule 4-10 (a)of regulation s-x.
proved oil and gas reserves are those quantities of
oil and gas, which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be
estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible  from a
given date forward, from known reservoirs, and under existing economic
conditions, operating methods and government regulations  prior to the time at
which contracts providing the right to operate expire, unless evidence
indicates that renewal is reasonably certain. in some cases, substantial new investments
in additional wells and related facilities will be required to recover these
proved reserves.
in accordance with the securities and exchange
commissions rules, the year-end reserves volumes as well as the reserves
change categories shown in the following tables were calculated using average
prices during the 12-month period prior to the ending date of the period
covered by the report, determined as an unweighted arithmetic average of the
first-day-of-the-month price for each month within such period. these reserves
quantities are also used in calculating unit-of-production depreciation rates
and in calculating the standardized measure of discounted net cash flow.
revisions can include upward or downward changes in
previously estimated volumes of proved reserves for existing fields due to the
evaluation or re-evaluation of (1)already available geologic, reservoir
or production data, (2)new geologic, reservoir or production data or
(3)changes in average prices and year-end costs that are used in the
estimation of reserves. this category can also include significant changes in
either development strategy or production equipment/facility capacity.
proved reserves include 100 percent of each
majority-owned affiliates participation in proved reserves and exxonmobils
ownership percentage of the proved reserves of equity companies, but exclude
royalties and quantities due others. gas reserves exclude the gaseous
equivalent of liquids expected to be removed from the gas on leases, at field
facilities and at gas processing plants. these liquids are included in net
proved reserves of crude oil and natural gas liquids.
in the proved reserves tables, consolidated reserves
and equity company reserves are reported separately. however, the corporation
does not view equity company reserves any differently than those from
consolidated companies.
reserves reported under production sharing and other
nonconcessionary agreements are based on the economic interest as defined by
the specific fiscal terms in the agreement. the production and reserves that we
report for these types of arrangements typically vary inversely with oil and
gas price changes. as oil and gas prices increase, the cash flow and value
received by the company increase; however, the production volumes and reserves
required to achieve this value will typically be lower because of the higher
prices. when prices decrease, the opposite effect generally occurs. the
percentage of total liquids and natural gas proved reserves (consolidated
subsidiaries plus equity companies) at year-end 2012 that were associated with
production sharing contract arrangements was 12 percent of liquids, 8 percent
of natural gas and 10 percent on an oil-equivalent basis (gas converted to
oil-equivalent at 6 billion cubic feet = 1million barrels).
net proved developed reserves are those volumes that
are expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and
operating methods or in which the cost of the required equipment is relatively
minor compared to the cost of a new well. net proved undeveloped reserves are
those volumes that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled
acreage, or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is
required for recompletion.
crude oil and natural gas liquids and natural gas
production quantities shown are the net volumes withdrawn from exxonmobils oil
and gas reserves. the natural gas quantities differ from the quantities of gas
delivered for sale by the producing function as reported in the operating
summary due to volumes consumed or flared and inventory changes.
in accordance with the securities and exchange
commissions rules, bitumen extracted through mining activities and
hydrocarbons from other non-traditional resources are reported as oil and gas
reserves beginning in 2009.
the rules in 2009 adopted a reliable technology
definition that permits reserves to be added based on technologies that have
been field tested and have been demonstrated to provide reasonably certain
results with consistency and repeatability in the formation being evaluated.
the changes between 2011 year-end proved reserves and
2012 year-end proved reserves reflect the extensions and discoveries in north
america.

standardized measure of discounted
future cash flows
as required by the financial accounting
standards board, the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows
is computed by applying first-day-of-the-month average prices,
year-endcosts and legislated tax rates and a discount factor of 10
percent tonet proved reserves. the standardized measure includes costs
for futuredismantlement, abandonment and rehabilitation obligations.
thecorporation believes the standardized measure does not provide
areliable estimate of the corporations expected future cash flows to be
obtained from the development and production of its oil and gas properties or
of the value of its proved oil and gas reserves. the standardized measure is
prepared on the basis of certain prescribed assumptions including
first-day-of-the-month average prices, which represent discrete points in time
and therefore may cause significant variability in cash flows from year to year
as prices change.
