BUSINESS

EXXON MOBIL CORPORATION WAS INCORPORATED IN THE STATE

OF NEW JERSEY IN 1882. DIVISIONS AND AFFILIATED COMPANIES OF EXXONMOBIL OPERATE

OR MARKET PRODUCTS IN THE UNITED STATES AND MOST OTHER COUNTRIES OF THE WORLD.

THEIR PRINCIPAL BUSINESS IS ENERGY, INVOLVING EXPLORATION FOR, AND PRODUCTION

OF, CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS, MANUFACTURE OF PETROLEUM PRODUCTS AND

TRANSPORTATION AND SALE OF CRUDE OIL, NATURAL GAS AND PETROLEUM PRODUCTS.

EXXONMOBIL IS A MAJOR MANUFACTURER AND MARKETER OF COMMODITY PETROCHEMICALS,

INCLUDING OLEFINS, AROMATICS, POLYETHYLENE AND POLYPROPYLENE PLASTICS AND A

WIDE VARIETY OF SPECIALTY PRODUCTS. EXXONMOBIL ALSO HAS INTERESTS IN ELECTRIC

POWER GENERATION FACILITIES. AFFILIATES OF EXXONMOBIL CONDUCT EXTENSIVE

RESEARCH PROGRAMS IN SUPPORT OF THESE BUSINESSES.

EXXON MOBIL CORPORATION HAS SEVERAL DIVISIONS AND

HUNDREDS OF AFFILIATES, MANY WITH NAMES THAT INCLUDE

EXXONMOBIL

,

EXXON

,

ESSO, MOBIL

OR

XTO

. FOR CONVENIENCE AND SIMPLICITY, IN THIS

AFFILIATES OR GROUPS OF AFFILIATES. THE PRECISE MEANING DEPENDS ON THE CONTEXT

IN QUESTION.

THROUGHOUT EXXONMOBIL’S BUSINESSES, NEW AND ONGOING

MEASURES ARE TAKEN TO PREVENT AND MINIMIZE THE IMPACT OF OUR OPERATIONS ON AIR,

WATER AND GROUND. THESE INCLUDE A SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT IN REFINING

INFRASTRUCTURE AND TECHNOLOGY TO MANUFACTURE CLEAN FUELS AS WELL AS PROJECTS TO

MONITOR AND REDUCE NITROGEN OXIDE, SULFUR OXIDE, AND GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS

AND EXPENDITURES FOR ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS.  USING DEFINITIONS AND

GUIDELINES ESTABLISHED BY THE AMERICAN PETROLEUM INSTITUTE, EXXONMOBIL’S 2012

WORLDWIDE ENVIRONMENTAL EXPENDITURES FOR ALL SUCH PREVENTATIVE AND REMEDIATION

STEPS, INCLUDING EXXONMOBIL’S SHARE OF EQUITY COMPANY EXPENDITURES, WERE $5.5 BILLION,

OF WHICH $3.5 BILLION WERE INCLUDED IN EXPENSES WITH THE REMAINDER IN

CAPITAL EXPENDITURES. THE TOTAL COST FOR SUCH ACTIVITIES IS EXPECTED TO HAVE A

MODEST INCREASE IN 2013 AND 2014 (WITH CAPITAL EXPENDITURES APPROXIMATELY 45

PERCENT OF THE TOTAL).

THE ENERGY AND PETROCHEMICAL INDUSTRIES ARE HIGHLY

COMPETITIVE. THERE IS COMPETITION WITHIN THE INDUSTRIES AND ALSO WITH OTHER

INDUSTRIES IN SUPPLYING THE ENERGY, FUEL AND CHEMICAL NEEDS OF BOTH INDUSTRIAL

AND INDIVIDUAL CONSUMERS. THE CORPORATION COMPETES WITH OTHER FIRMS IN THE SALE

OR PURCHASE OF NEEDED GOODS AND SERVICES IN MANY NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL

MARKETS AND EMPLOYS ALL METHODS OF COMPETITION WHICH ARE LAWFUL AND APPROPRIATE

FOR SUCH PURPOSES.

OPERATING DATA AND INDUSTRY SEGMENT INFORMATION FOR

THE CORPORATION ARE CONTAINED IN THE FINANCIAL SECTION OF THIS REPORT UNDER THE

FOLLOWING: “QUARTERLY INFORMATION”, “NOTE 18: DISCLOSURES ABOUT SEGMENTS

AND RELATED INFORMATION” AND “OPERATING SUMMARY”. INFORMATION ON OIL AND GAS

RESERVES IS CONTAINED IN THE “OIL AND GAS RESERVES” PART OF THE “SUPPLEMENTAL

INFORMATION ON OIL AND GAS EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION ACTIVITIES” PORTION OF

THE FINANCIAL SECTION OF THIS REPORT.

EXXONMOBIL HAS A LONG-STANDING COMMITMENT TO THE

DEVELOPMENT OF PROPRIETARY TECHNOLOGY. WE HAVE A WIDE ARRAY OF RESEARCH

PROGRAMS DESIGNED TO MEET THE NEEDS IDENTIFIED IN EACH OF OUR BUSINESS

SEGMENTS. INFORMATION ON COMPANY-SPONSORED RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT SPENDING IS

CONTAINED IN “NOTE 3: MISCELLANEOUS FINANCIAL INFORMATION” OF THE

FINANCIAL SECTION OF THIS REPORT. EXXONMOBIL HELD APPROXIMATELY 11 THOUSAND

ACTIVE PATENTS WORLDWIDE AT THE END OF 2012. FOR TECHNOLOGY LICENSED TO THIRD

PARTIES, REVENUES TOTALED APPROXIMATELY $176 MILLION IN 2012. ALTHOUGH

TECHNOLOGY IS AN IMPORTANT CONTRIBUTOR TO THE OVERALL OPERATIONS AND RESULTS OF

OUR COMPANY, THE PROFITABILITY OF EACH BUSINESS SEGMENT IS NOT DEPENDENT ON ANY

INDIVIDUAL PATENT, TRADE SECRET, TRADEMARK, LICENSE, FRANCHISE OR CONCESSION.

THE NUMBER OF REGULAR EMPLOYEES WAS 76.9 THOUSAND, 82.1

THOUSAND AND 83.6 THOUSAND AT YEARS ENDED 2012, 2011 AND 2010, RESPECTIVELY.

REGULAR EMPLOYEES ARE DEFINED AS ACTIVE EXECUTIVE, MANAGEMENT, PROFESSIONAL,

TECHNICAL AND WAGE EMPLOYEES WHO WORK FULL TIME OR PART TIME FOR THE

CORPORATION AND ARE COVERED BY THE CORPORATION’S BENEFIT PLANS AND PROGRAMS.

REGULAR EMPLOYEES DO NOT INCLUDE EMPLOYEES OF THE COMPANY-OPERATED RETAIL SITES

(CORS). THE NUMBER OF CORS EMPLOYEES WAS 11.1 THOUSAND, 17.0 THOUSAND AND 20.1

THOUSAND AT YEARS ENDED 2012, 2011 AND 2010, RESPECTIVELY.

1

ITEM 1A.  RISK FACTORS

EXXONMOBIL’S FINANCIAL AND OPERATING

RESULTS ARE SUBJECT TO A VARIETY OF RISKS INHERENT IN THE GLOBAL OIL, GAS, AND

PETROCHEMICAL BUSINESSES. MANY OF THESE RISK FACTORS ARE NOT WITHIN THE

COMPANY’S CONTROL AND COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, OUR FINANCIAL AND

OPERATING RESULTS OR OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION. THESE RISK FACTORS INCLUDE.

SUPPLY AND DEMAND

THE OIL, GAS, AND PETROCHEMICAL BUSINESSES ARE

FUNDAMENTALLY COMMODITY BUSINESSES. THIS MEANS EXXONMOBIL’S OPERATIONS AND

EARNINGS MAY BE SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTED BY CHANGES IN OIL, GAS AND PETROCHEMICAL

PRICES AND BY CHANGES IN MARGINS ON REFINED PRODUCTS. OIL, GAS, PETROCHEMICAL

AND PRODUCT PRICES AND MARGINS IN TURN DEPEND ON LOCAL, REGIONAL AND GLOBAL

EVENTS OR CONDITIONS THAT AFFECT SUPPLY AND DEMAND FOR THE RELEVANT COMMODITY.

ECONOMIC CONDITIONS.

THE DEMAND FOR ENERGY AND PETROCHEMICALS CORRELATES CLOSELY WITH

GENERAL ECONOMIC GROWTH RATES. THE OCCURRENCE OF RECESSIONS OR OTHER PERIODS OF

LOW OR NEGATIVE ECONOMIC GROWTH WILL TYPICALLY HAVE A DIRECT ADVERSE IMPACT ON

OUR RESULTS. OTHER FACTORS THAT AFFECT GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS IN THE WORLD

OR IN A MAJOR REGION, SUCH AS CHANGES IN POPULATION GROWTH RATES, PERIODS OF

CIVIL UNREST, GOVERNMENT AUSTERITY PROGRAMS, OR CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE

FLUCTUATIONS, CAN ALSO IMPACT THE DEMAND FOR ENERGY AND PETROCHEMICALS.

SOVEREIGN DEBT DOWNGRADES, DEFAULTS, INABILITY TO ACCESS DEBT MARKETS DUE TO

CREDIT OR LEGAL CONSTRAINTS, LIQUIDITY CRISES, THE BREAKUP OR RESTRUCTURING OF

FISCAL, MONETARY, OR POLITICAL SYSTEMS SUCH AS THE EUROPEAN UNION, AND OTHER

EVENTS OR CONDITIONS THAT IMPAIR THE FUNCTIONING OF FINANCIAL MARKETS AND

INSTITUTIONS ALSO POSE RISKS TO EXXONMOBIL, INCLUDING RISKS TO THE SAFETY OF

OUR FINANCIAL ASSETS AND TO THE ABILITY OF OUR PARTNERS AND CUSTOMERS TO

FULFILL THEIR COMMITMENTS TO EXXONMOBIL.

OTHER DEMAND-RELATED FACTORS.

OTHER FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT THE DEMAND FOR OIL, GAS

AND PETROCHEMICALS, AND THEREFORE IMPACT OUR RESULTS, INCLUDE TECHNOLOGICAL

IMPROVEMENTS IN ENERGY EFFICIENCY; SEASONAL WEATHER PATTERNS, WHICH AFFECT THE

DEMAND FOR ENERGY ASSOCIATED WITH HEATING AND COOLING; INCREASED

COMPETITIVENESS OF ALTERNATIVE ENERGY SOURCES THAT HAVE SO FAR GENERALLY NOT

BEEN COMPETITIVE WITH OIL AND GAS WITHOUT THE BENEFIT OF GOVERNMENT SUBSIDIES

OR MANDATES; AND CHANGES IN TECHNOLOGY OR CONSUMER PREFERENCES THAT ALTER FUEL

CHOICES, SUCH AS TOWARD ALTERNATIVE FUELED VEHICLES.

OTHER SUPPLY-RELATED FACTORS.

COMMODITY PRICES AND MARGINS ALSO VARY DEPENDING ON A

NUMBER OF FACTORS AFFECTING SUPPLY. FOR EXAMPLE, INCREASED SUPPLY FROM THE DEVELOPMENT

OF NEW OIL AND GAS SUPPLY SOURCES AND TECHNOLOGIES TO ENHANCE RECOVERY FROM

EXISTING SOURCES TEND TO REDUCE COMMODITY PRICES TO THE EXTENT SUCH SUPPLY

INCREASES ARE NOT OFFSET BY COMMENSURATE GROWTH IN DEMAND. SIMILARLY, INCREASES

IN INDUSTRY REFINING OR PETROCHEMICAL MANUFACTURING CAPACITY TEND TO REDUCE

MARGINS ON THE AFFECTED PRODUCTS. WORLD OIL, GAS, AND PETROCHEMICAL SUPPLY

LEVELS CAN ALSO BE AFFECTED BY FACTORS THAT REDUCE AVAILABLE SUPPLIES, SUCH AS

ADHERENCE BY MEMBER COUNTRIES TO OPEC PRODUCTION QUOTAS AND THE OCCURRENCE OF

WARS, HOSTILE ACTIONS, NATURAL DISASTERS, DISRUPTIONS IN COMPETITORS’

OPERATIONS, OR UNEXPECTED UNAVAILABILITY OF DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS THAT MAY

DISRUPT SUPPLIES. TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE CAN ALSO ALTER THE RELATIVE COSTS FOR

COMPETITORS TO FIND, PRODUCE, AND REFINE OIL AND GAS AND TO MANUFACTURE

PETROCHEMICALS.

OTHER MARKET FACTORS.

EXXONMOBIL’S BUSINESS RESULTS ARE ALSO EXPOSED TO

POTENTIAL NEGATIVE IMPACTS DUE TO CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES, INFLATION,

CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES, AND OTHER LOCAL OR REGIONAL MARKET CONDITIONS. WE

GENERALLY DO NOT USE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS TO HEDGE MARKET EXPOSURES.

GOVERNMENT AND POLITICAL FACTORS

EXXONMOBIL’S RESULTS CAN BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY

POLITICAL OR REGULATORY DEVELOPMENTS AFFECTING OUR OPERATIONS.

ACCESS LIMITATIONS.

A NUMBER OF COUNTRIES LIMIT ACCESS TO THEIR OIL AND GAS RESOURCES, OR

MAY PLACE RESOURCES OFF-LIMITS FROM DEVELOPMENT ALTOGETHER. RESTRICTIONS ON

FOREIGN INVESTMENT IN THE OIL AND GAS SECTOR TEND TO INCREASE IN TIMES OF HIGH

COMMODITY PRICES, WHEN NATIONAL GOVERNMENTS MAY HAVE LESS NEED OF OUTSIDE

SOURCES OF PRIVATE CAPITAL. MANY COUNTRIES ALSO RESTRICT THE IMPORT OR EXPORT

OF CERTAIN PRODUCTS BASED ON POINT OF ORIGIN.

RESTRICTIONS ON DOING BUSINESS.

AS A U.S. COMPANY, EXXONMOBIL IS SUBJECT TO LAWS

PROHIBITING U.S. COMPANIES FROM DOING BUSINESS IN CERTAIN COUNTRIES, OR

RESTRICTING THE KIND OF BUSINESS THAT MAY BE CONDUCTED. SUCH RESTRICTIONS MAY

PROVIDE A COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE TO OUR NON-U.S. COMPETITORS UNLESS THEIR OWN

HOME COUNTRIES IMPOSE COMPARABLE RESTRICTIONS.

LACK OF LEGAL CERTAINTY.

SOME COUNTRIES IN WHICH WE DO BUSINESS LACK

WELL-DEVELOPED LEGAL SYSTEMS, OR HAVE NOT YET ADOPTED CLEAR REGULATORY

FRAMEWORKS FOR OIL AND GAS DEVELOPMENT. LACK OF LEGAL CERTAINTY EXPOSES OUR

OPERATIONS TO INCREASED RISK OF ADVERSE OR UNPREDICTABLE ACTIONS BY GOVERNMENT

OFFICIALS, AND ALSO MAKES IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR US TO ENFORCE OUR CONTRACTS. IN

SOME CASES THESE RISKS CAN BE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AGREEMENTS TO ARBITRATE

DISPUTES IN AN INTERNATIONAL FORUM, BUT THE ADEQUACY OF THIS REMEDY MAY STILL

DEPEND ON THE LOCAL LEGAL SYSTEM TO ENFORCE AN AWARD.

2

REGULATORY AND LITIGATION RISKS.

EVEN IN COUNTRIES WITH WELL-DEVELOPED LEGAL

SYSTEMS WHERE EXXONMOBIL DOES BUSINESS, WE REMAIN EXPOSED TO CHANGES IN LAW

(INCLUDING CHANGES THAT RESULT FROM INTERNATIONAL TREATIES AND ACCORDS) THAT

COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS, SUCH AS.

·

INCREASES IN TAXES OR GOVERNMENT ROYALTY RATES

(INCLUDING RETROACTIVE CLAIMS);

·

PRICE CONTROLS;

·

CHANGES IN ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS OR OTHER LAWS

THAT INCREASE OUR COST OF COMPLIANCE OR REDUCE OR DELAY AVAILABLE BUSINESS

OPPORTUNITIES (INCLUDING CHANGES IN LAWS RELATED TO OFFSHORE DRILLING

OPERATIONS, WATER USE, OR HYDRAULIC FRACTURING);

·

ADOPTION OF REGULATIONS MANDATING THE USE OF

ALTERNATIVE FUELS OR UNCOMPETITIVE FUEL COMPONENTS;

·

ADOPTION OF GOVERNMENT PAYMENT TRANSPARENCY

REGULATIONS THAT COULD REQUIRE US TO DISCLOSE COMPETITIVELY SENSITIVE

COMMERCIAL INFORMATION, OR THAT COULD CAUSE US TO VIOLATE THE NON-DISCLOSURE

LAWS OF OTHER COUNTRIES; AND

·

GOVERNMENT ACTIONS TO CANCEL CONTRACTS,

RE-DENOMINATE THE OFFICIAL CURRENCY, RENOUNCE OR DEFAULT ON OBLIGATIONS,

RENEGOTIATE TERMS UNILATERALLY, OR EXPROPRIATE ASSETS.

LEGAL REMEDIES AVAILABLE TO COMPENSATE US FOR

EXPROPRIATION OR OTHER TAKINGS MAY BE INADEQUATE.

WE ALSO MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY THE OUTCOME OF

LITIGATION OR OTHER LEGAL PROCEEDINGS, ESPECIALLY IN COUNTRIES SUCH AS THE

UNITED STATES IN WHICH VERY LARGE AND UNPREDICTABLE PUNITIVE DAMAGE AWARDS MAY

OCCUR.

SECURITY CONCERNS.

SUCCESSFUL OPERATION OF PARTICULAR FACILITIES OR PROJECTS MAY BE

DISRUPTED BY CIVIL UNREST, ACTS OF SABOTAGE OR TERRORISM, AND OTHER LOCAL

SECURITY CONCERNS. SUCH CONCERNS MAY REQUIRE US TO INCUR GREATER COSTS FOR

SECURITY OR TO SHUT DOWN OPERATIONS FOR A PERIOD OF TIME.

CLIMATE CHANGE AND GREENHOUSE GAS RESTRICTIONS.

DUE TO CONCERN OVER THE RISK OF CLIMATE CHANGE, A

NUMBER OF COUNTRIES HAVE ADOPTED, OR ARE CONSIDERING THE ADOPTION OF,

REGULATORY FRAMEWORKS TO REDUCE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS. THESE INCLUDE

ADOPTION OF CAP AND TRADE REGIMES, CARBON TAXES, RESTRICTIVE PERMITTING,

INCREASED EFFICIENCY STANDARDS, AND INCENTIVES OR MANDATES FOR RENEWABLE

ENERGY. THESE REQUIREMENTS COULD MAKE OUR PRODUCTS MORE EXPENSIVE, LENGTHEN PROJECT

IMPLEMENTATION TIMES, AND REDUCE DEMAND FOR HYDROCARBONS, AS WELL AS SHIFT

HYDROCARBON DEMAND TOWARD RELATIVELY LOWER-CARBON SOURCES SUCH AS NATURAL GAS.

CURRENT AND PENDING GREENHOUSE GAS REGULATIONS MAY ALSO INCREASE OUR COMPLIANCE

COSTS, SUCH AS FOR MONITORING OR SEQUESTERING EMISSIONS.

GOVERNMENT SPONSORSHIP OF ALTERNATIVE ENERGY.

MANY GOVERNMENTS ARE PROVIDING TAX ADVANTAGES AND

OTHER SUBSIDIES TO SUPPORT ALTERNATIVE ENERGY SOURCES OR ARE MANDATING THE USE

OF SPECIFIC FUELS OR TECHNOLOGIES. GOVERNMENTS ARE ALSO PROMOTING RESEARCH INTO

NEW TECHNOLOGIES TO REDUCE THE COST AND INCREASE THE SCALABILITY OF ALTERNATIVE

ENERGY SOURCES. WE ARE CONDUCTING OUR OWN RESEARCH EFFORTS INTO ALTERNATIVE

ENERGY, SUCH AS THROUGH SPONSORSHIP OF THE GLOBAL CLIMATE AND ENERGY PROJECT AT

STANFORD UNIVERSITY AND RESEARCH INTO FUEL-PRODUCING ALGAE. OUR FUTURE RESULTS

MAY DEPEND IN PART ON THE SUCCESS OF OUR RESEARCH EFFORTS AND ON OUR ABILITY TO

ADAPT AND APPLY THE STRENGTHS OF OUR CURRENT BUSINESS MODEL TO PROVIDING THE ENERGY

PRODUCTS OF THE FUTURE IN A COST-COMPETITIVE MANNER. SEE “MANAGEMENT

EFFECTIVENESS” BELOW.

MANAGEMENT EFFECTIVENESS

IN ADDITION TO EXTERNAL ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL

FACTORS, OUR FUTURE BUSINESS RESULTS ALSO DEPEND ON OUR ABILITY TO MANAGE

SUCCESSFULLY THOSE FACTORS THAT ARE AT LEAST IN PART WITHIN OUR CONTROL. THE

EXTENT TO WHICH WE MANAGE THESE FACTORS WILL IMPACT OUR PERFORMANCE RELATIVE TO

COMPETITION. FOR PROJECTS IN WHICH WE ARE NOT THE OPERATOR, WE DEPEND ON THE

MANAGEMENT EFFECTIVENESS OF ONE OR MORE CO-VENTURERS WHOM WE DO NOT CONTROL.

EXPLORATION AND DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM.

OUR ABILITY TO MAINTAIN AND GROW OUR OIL AND GAS

PRODUCTION DEPENDS ON THE SUCCESS OF OUR EXPLORATION AND DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS.

AMONG OTHER FACTORS, WE MUST CONTINUOUSLY IMPROVE OUR ABILITY TO IDENTIFY THE

MOST PROMISING RESOURCE PROSPECTS AND APPLY OUR PROJECT MANAGEMENT EXPERTISE TO

BRING DISCOVERED RESOURCES ON LINE ON SCHEDULE AND WITHIN BUDGET.

PROJECT MANAGEMENT.

THE SUCCESS OF EXXONMOBIL’S UPSTREAM, DOWNSTREAM, AND CHEMICAL

BUSINESSES DEPENDS ON COMPLEX, LONG-TERM, CAPITAL INTENSIVE PROJECTS. THESE

PROJECTS IN TURN REQUIRE A HIGH DEGREE OF PROJECT MANAGEMENT EXPERTISE TO

MAXIMIZE EFFICIENCY. SPECIFIC FACTORS THAT CAN AFFECT THE PERFORMANCE OF MAJOR

PROJECTS INCLUDE OUR ABILITY TO: NEGOTIATE SUCCESSFULLY WITH JOINT VENTURERS,

PARTNERS, GOVERNMENTS, SUPPLIERS, CUSTOMERS, OR OTHERS; MODEL AND OPTIMIZE

RESERVOIR PERFORMANCE; DEVELOP MARKETS FOR PROJECT OUTPUTS, WHETHER THROUGH

LONG-TERM CONTRACTS OR THE DEVELOPMENT OF EFFECTIVE SPOT MARKETS; MANAGE

CHANGES IN OPERATING CONDITIONS AND COSTS, INCLUDING COSTS OF THIRD PARTY

EQUIPMENT OR SERVICES SUCH AS DRILLING RIGS AND SHIPPING; PREVENT, TO THE

EXTENT POSSIBLE, AND RESPOND EFFECTIVELY TO UNFORESEEN TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES

THAT COULD DELAY PROJECT STARTUP OR CAUSE UNSCHEDULED PROJECT DOWNTIME; AND

INFLUENCE THE PERFORMANCE OF PROJECT OPERATORS WHERE EXXONMOBIL DOES NOT

PERFORM THAT ROLE.

3

THE TERM “PROJECT” AS USED IN THIS REPORT DOES NOT

NECESSARILY HAVE THE SAME MEANING AS UNDER SEC RULE 13Q-1 RELATING TO

GOVERNMENT PAYMENT REPORTING.  FOR EXAMPLE, A SINGLE PROJECT FOR PURPOSES OF

THE RULE MAY ENCOMPASS NUMEROUS PROPERTIES, AGREEMENTS, INVESTMENTS,

DEVELOPMENTS, PHASES, WORK EFFORTS, ACTIVITIES, AND COMPONENTS, EACH OF WHICH WE

MAY ALSO INFORMALLY DESCRIBE AS A “PROJECT”.

OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCY.

AN IMPORTANT COMPONENT OF EXXONMOBIL’S COMPETITIVE

PERFORMANCE, ESPECIALLY GIVEN THE COMMODITY-BASED NATURE OF MANY OF OUR

BUSINESSES, IS OUR ABILITY TO OPERATE EFFICIENTLY, INCLUDING OUR ABILITY TO

MANAGE EXPENSES AND IMPROVE PRODUCTION YIELDS ON AN ONGOING BASIS. THIS

REQUIRES CONTINUOUS MANAGEMENT FOCUS, INCLUDING TECHNOLOGY IMPROVEMENTS, COST

CONTROL, PRODUCTIVITY ENHANCEMENTS, REGULAR REAPPRAISAL OF OUR ASSET PORTFOLIO,

AND THE RECRUITMENT, DEVELOPMENT AND RETENTION OF HIGH CALIBER EMPLOYEES.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT.

TO MAINTAIN OUR COMPETITIVE POSITION, ESPECIALLY IN

LIGHT OF THE TECHNOLOGICAL NATURE OF OUR BUSINESSES AND THE NEED FOR CONTINUOUS

EFFICIENCY IMPROVEMENT, EXXONMOBIL’S RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ORGANIZATIONS

MUST BE SUCCESSFUL AND ABLE TO ADAPT TO A CHANGING MARKET AND POLICY

ENVIRONMENT.

SAFETY, BUSINESS CONTROLS, AND ENVIRONMENTAL RISK

MANAGEMENT.

OUR RESULTS DEPEND ON

MANAGEMENT’S ABILITY TO MINIMIZE THE INHERENT RISKS OF OIL, GAS, AND

PETROCHEMICAL OPERATIONS, TO CONTROL EFFECTIVELY OUR BUSINESS ACTIVITIES AND TO

MINIMIZE THE POTENTIAL FOR HUMAN ERROR. WE APPLY RIGOROUS MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS

AND CONTINUOUS FOCUS TO WORKPLACE SAFETY AND TO AVOIDING SPILLS OR OTHER ADVERSE

ENVIRONMENTAL EVENTS. FOR EXAMPLE, WE WORK TO MINIMIZE SPILLS THROUGH A

COMBINED PROGRAM OF EFFECTIVE OPERATIONS INTEGRITY MANAGEMENT, ONGOING

UPGRADES, KEY EQUIPMENT REPLACEMENTS, AND COMPREHENSIVE INSPECTION AND

SURVEILLANCE. SIMILARLY, WE ARE IMPLEMENTING COST-EFFECTIVE NEW TECHNOLOGIES

AND ADOPTING NEW OPERATING PRACTICES TO REDUCE AIR EMISSIONS, NOT ONLY IN

RESPONSE TO GOVERNMENT REQUIREMENTS BUT ALSO TO ADDRESS COMMUNITY PRIORITIES.

WE ALSO MAINTAIN A DISCIPLINED FRAMEWORK OF INTERNAL CONTROLS AND APPLY A

CONTROLS MANAGEMENT SYSTEM FOR MONITORING COMPLIANCE WITH THIS FRAMEWORK.

SUBSTANTIAL LIABILITIES AND OTHER ADVERSE IMPACTS COULD RESULT IF OUR

MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS AND CONTROLS DO NOT FUNCTION AS INTENDED. THE ABILITY TO

INSURE AGAINST SUCH RISKS IS LIMITED BY THE CAPACITY OF THE APPLICABLE

INSURANCE MARKETS, WHICH MAY NOT BE SUFFICIENT.

BUSINESS RISKS ALSO INCLUDE THE RISK OF CYBERSECURITY

BREACHES. IF OUR SYSTEMS FOR PROTECTING AGAINST CYBERSECURITY RISKS PROVE NOT

TO BE SUFFICIENT, EXXONMOBIL COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED SUCH AS BY HAVING ITS

BUSINESS SYSTEMS COMPROMISED, ITS PROPRIETARY INFORMATION ALTERED, LOST OR

STOLEN, OR ITS BUSINESS OPERATIONS DISRUPTED.

PREPAREDNESS.

OUR OPERATIONS MAY BE DISRUPTED BY SEVERE WEATHER EVENTS, NATURAL DISASTERS,

HUMAN ERROR, AND SIMILAR EVENTS. FOR EXAMPLE, HURRICANES MAY DAMAGE OUR

OFFSHORE PRODUCTION FACILITIES OR COASTAL REFINING AND PETROCHEMICAL PLANTS IN

VULNERABLE AREAS. OUR ABILITY TO MITIGATE THE ADVERSE IMPACTS OF THESE EVENTS

DEPENDS IN PART UPON THE EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR RIGOROUS DISASTER PREPAREDNESS

AND RESPONSE PLANNING, AS WELL AS BUSINESS CONTINUITY PLANNING.

PROJECTIONS, ESTIMATES AND DESCRIPTIONS OF

EXXONMOBIL’S PLANS AND OBJECTIVES INCLUDED OR INCORPORATED IN ITEMS 1, 1A, 2, 7

AND 7A OF THIS REPORT ARE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS. ACTUAL FUTURE RESULTS,

INCLUDING PROJECT COMPLETION DATES, PRODUCTION RATES, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES,

IN THE PRECEDING RESERVES INFORMATION, CONSOLIDATED

SUBSIDIARY AND EQUITY COMPANY RESERVES ARE REPORTED SEPARATELY. HOWEVER, THE

CORPORATION OPERATES ITS BUSINESS WITH THE SAME VIEW OF EQUITY COMPANY RESERVES

AS IT HAS FOR RESERVES FROM CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES.

THE CORPORATION’S OVERALL VOLUME CAPACITY OUTLOOK,

BASED ON PROJECTS COMING ON STREAM AS ANTICIPATED, IS FOR PRODUCTION CAPACITY

TO GROW OVER THE PERIOD 2013-2017. HOWEVER, ACTUAL VOLUMES WILL VARY FROM YEAR

TO YEAR DUE TO THE TIMING OF INDIVIDUAL PROJECT START-UPS, OPERATIONAL OUTAGES,

RESERVOIR PERFORMANCE, REGULATORY CHANGES, ASSET SALES, WEATHER EVENTS, PRICE

EFFECTS ON PRODUCTION SHARING CONTRACTS AND OTHER FACTORS AS DESCRIBED IN ITEM

1A—RISK FACTORS OF THIS REPORT.

THE ESTIMATION OF PROVED RESERVES, WHICH IS BASED ON

THE REQUIREMENT OF REASONABLE CERTAINTY, IS AN ONGOING PROCESS BASED ON

RIGOROUS TECHNICAL EVALUATIONS, COMMERCIAL AND MARKET ASSESSMENTS AND DETAILED

ANALYSIS OF WELL AND RESERVOIR INFORMATION SUCH AS FLOW RATES AND RESERVOIR

PRESSURE DECLINES. FURTHERMORE, THE CORPORATION ONLY RECORDS PROVED RESERVES

FOR PROJECTS WHICH HAVE RECEIVED SIGNIFICANT FUNDING COMMITMENTS BY MANAGEMENT

MADE TOWARD THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE RESERVES. ALTHOUGH THE CORPORATION IS

REASONABLY CERTAIN THAT PROVED RESERVES WILL BE PRODUCED, THE TIMING AND AMOUNT

RECOVERED CAN BE AFFECTED BY A NUMBER OF FACTORS INCLUDING COMPLETION OF

DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS, RESERVOIR PERFORMANCE, REGULATORY APPROVALS AND

SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN PROJECTIONS OF LONG-TERM OIL AND GAS PRICE LEVELS.

B. TECHNOLOGIES USED IN ESTABLISHING PROVED

RESERVES ADDITIONS IN 2012

ADDITIONS TO EXXONMOBIL’S PROVED RESERVES IN 2012 WERE

BASED ON ESTIMATES GENERATED THROUGH THE INTEGRATION OF AVAILABLE AND

APPROPRIATE GEOLOGICAL, ENGINEERING AND PRODUCTION DATA, UTILIZING

WELL-ESTABLISHED TECHNOLOGIES THAT HAVE BEEN DEMONSTRATED IN THE FIELD TO YIELD

REPEATABLE AND CONSISTENT RESULTS.

DATA USED IN THESE INTEGRATED ASSESSMENTS INCLUDED

INFORMATION OBTAINED DIRECTLY FROM THE SUBSURFACE VIA WELLBORES, SUCH AS WELL

LOGS, RESERVOIR CORE SAMPLES, FLUID SAMPLES, STATIC AND DYNAMIC PRESSURE

INFORMATION, PRODUCTION TEST DATA, AND SURVEILLANCE AND PERFORMANCE

INFORMATION. THE DATA UTILIZED ALSO INCLUDED SUBSURFACE INFORMATION OBTAINED

THROUGH INDIRECT MEASUREMENTS INCLUDING HIGH-QUALITY 2-D AND 3-D SEISMIC DATA,

CALIBRATED WITH AVAILABLE WELL CONTROL INFORMATION. THE TOOLS USED TO INTERPRET

THE DATA INCLUDED PROPRIETARY SEISMIC PROCESSING SOFTWARE, PROPRIETARY

RESERVOIR MODELING AND SIMULATION SOFTWARE, AND COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE DATA

ANALYSIS PACKAGES.

IN SOME CIRCUMSTANCES, WHERE APPROPRIATE ANALOG

RESERVOIRS WERE AVAILABLE, RESERVOIR PARAMETERS FROM THESE ANALOGS WERE USED TO

INCREASE THE QUALITY OF AND CONFIDENCE IN THE RESERVES ESTIMATES.

C. QUALIFICATIONS OF RESERVES

TECHNICAL OVERSIGHT GROUP AND INTERNAL CONTROLS OVER PROVED RESERVES

EXXONMOBIL HAS A DEDICATED GLOBAL RESERVES GROUP THAT PROVIDES

TECHNICAL OVERSIGHT AND IS SEPARATE FROM THE OPERATING ORGANIZATION. PRIMARY

RESPONSIBILITIES OF THIS GROUP INCLUDE OVERSIGHT OF THE RESERVES ESTIMATION PROCESS

FOR COMPLIANCE WITH SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (SEC) RULES AND

REGULATIONS, REVIEW OF ANNUAL CHANGES IN RESERVES ESTIMATES, AND THE REPORTING

OF EXXONMOBIL’S PROVED RESERVES. THIS GROUP ALSO MAINTAINS THE OFFICIAL COMPANY

RESERVES ESTIMATES FOR EXXONMOBIL’S PROVED RESERVES OF CRUDE AND NATURAL GAS

LIQUIDS, BITUMEN, SYNTHETIC OIL AND NATURAL GAS. IN ADDITION, THE GROUP

PROVIDES TRAINING TO PERSONNEL INVOLVED IN THE RESERVES ESTIMATION AND

REPORTING PROCESS WITHIN EXXONMOBIL AND ITS AFFILIATES. THE GROUP IS MANAGED BY

AND STAFFED WITH INDIVIDUALS THAT HAVE AN AVERAGE OF MORE THAN 20 YEARS OF

TECHNICAL EXPERIENCE IN THE PETROLEUM INDUSTRY, INCLUDING EXPERTISE IN THE

CLASSIFICATION AND CATEGORIZATION OF RESERVES UNDER THE SEC GUIDELINES. THIS GROUP

INCLUDES INDIVIDUALS WHO HOLD ADVANCED DEGREES IN EITHER ENGINEERING OR

GEOLOGY. SEVERAL MEMBERS OF THE GROUP HOLD PROFESSIONAL REGISTRATIONS IN THEIR

FIELD OF EXPERTISE, AND SEVERAL HAVE SERVED ON THE OIL AND GAS RESERVES

COMMITTEE OF THE SOCIETY OF PETROLEUM ENGINEERS.

THE GLOBAL RESERVES GROUP MAINTAINS A CENTRAL DATABASE

CONTAINING THE OFFICIAL COMPANY GLOBAL RESERVES ESTIMATES. APPROPRIATE

CONTROLS, INCLUDING LIMITATIONS ON DATABASE ACCESS AND UPDATE CAPABILITIES, ARE

IN PLACE TO ENSURE DATA INTEGRITY WITHIN THIS CENTRAL DATABASE. AN ANNUAL

REVIEW OF THE SYSTEM’S CONTROLS IS PERFORMED BY INTERNAL AUDIT. KEY COMPONENTS

OF THE RESERVES ESTIMATION PROCESS INCLUDE TECHNICAL EVALUATIONS AND ANALYSIS

OF WELL AND FIELD PERFORMANCE AND A RIGOROUS PEER REVIEW. NO CHANGES MAY BE

MADE TO THE RESERVES ESTIMATES IN THE CENTRAL DATABASE, INCLUDING ADDITIONS OF

ANY NEW INITIAL RESERVES ESTIMATES OR SUBSEQUENT REVISIONS, UNLESS THESE

CHANGES HAVE BEEN THOROUGHLY REVIEWED AND EVALUATED BY DULY AUTHORIZED

PERSONNEL WITHIN THE OPERATING ORGANIZATION. IN ADDITION, CHANGES TO RESERVES

ESTIMATES THAT EXCEED CERTAIN THRESHOLDS REQUIRE FURTHER REVIEW AND APPROVAL OF

THE APPROPRIATE LEVEL OF MANAGEMENT WITHIN THE OPERATING ORGANIZATION BEFORE

THE CHANGES MAY BE MADE IN THE CENTRAL DATABASE. ENDORSEMENT BY THE GLOBAL RESERVES

GROUP FOR ALL PROVED RESERVES CHANGES IS A MANDATORY COMPONENT OF THIS REVIEW

PROCESS. AFTER ALL CHANGES ARE MADE, REVIEWS ARE HELD WITH SENIOR MANAGEMENT

FOR FINAL ENDORSEMENT.

2. PROVED UNDEVELOPED

RESERVES

AT YEAR-END 2012, APPROXIMATELY 9.9 BILLION

OIL-EQUIVALENT BARRELS (GOEB) OF EXXONMOBIL’S PROVED RESERVES WERE CLASSIFIED

AS PROVED UNDEVELOPED. THIS REPRESENTS 39 PERCENT OF THE 25.2 GOEB REPORTED IN

PROVED RESERVES. THIS COMPARES TO THE 8.8 GOEB OF PROVED UNDEVELOPED RESERVES

REPORTED AT THE END OF 2011. THE NET INCREASE IS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE ADDITION

OF NEW PROJECTS IN

6

CANADA AND THE UNITED STATES. DURING

THE YEAR, EXXONMOBIL CONDUCTED DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES IN OVER 100 FIELDS THAT

RESULTED IN THE TRANSFER OF APPROXIMATELY 0.5 GOEB FROM PROVED UNDEVELOPED TO

PROVED DEVELOPED RESERVES BY YEAR-END. THE LARGEST TRANSFERS WERE RELATED TO

COMPLETION OF DRILLING AND THE INITIATION OF PRODUCTION ACTIVITIES IN

UNCONVENTIONAL FIELDS IN THE UNITED STATES AND ON NEW PAD LOCATIONS IN THE COLD

LAKE FIELD IN CANADA.

ONE OF EXXONMOBIL’S REQUIREMENTS FOR REPORTING PROVED

RESERVES IS THAT MANAGEMENT HAS MADE SIGNIFICANT FUNDING COMMITMENTS TOWARD THE

DEVELOPMENT OF THE RESERVES. EXXONMOBIL HAS A DISCIPLINED INVESTMENT STRATEGY

AND MANY MAJOR FIELDS REQUIRE LONG LEAD-TIME IN ORDER TO BE DEVELOPED.

DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS TYPICALLY TAKE TWO TO FOUR YEARS FROM THE TIME OF FIRST

RECORDING OF PROVED RESERVES TO THE START OF PRODUCTION OF THESE RESERVES.

HOWEVER, THE DEVELOPMENT TIME FOR LARGE AND COMPLEX PROJECTS CAN EXCEED FIVE

YEARS. DURING 2012, DISCOVERIES AND EXTENSIONS RELATED TO NEW PROJECTS ADDED

APPROXIMATELY 1.3 GOEB OF PROVED UNDEVELOPED RESERVES. THE LARGEST OF THESE

ADDITIONS WERE RELATED TO PLANNED DRILLING IN THE UNITED STATES. OVERALL,

INVESTMENTS OF $24.8 BILLION WERE MADE BY THE CORPORATION DURING 2012 TO

PROGRESS THE DEVELOPMENT OF REPORTED PROVED UNDEVELOPED RESERVES, INCLUDING $21.7

BILLION FOR OIL AND GAS PRODUCING ACTIVITIES AND AN ADDITIONAL $3.1 BILLION FOR

OTHER NON-OIL AND GAS PRODUCING ACTIVITIES SUCH AS THE CONSTRUCTION OF SUPPORT

INFRASTRUCTURE AND OTHER RELATED FACILITIES THAT WERE UNDERTAKEN TO PROGRESS

THE DEVELOPMENT OF PROVED UNDEVELOPED RESERVES. THESE INVESTMENTS REPRESENTED 69

PERCENT OF THE $36.1 BILLION IN TOTAL REPORTED UPSTREAM CAPITAL AND EXPLORATION

EXPENDITURES.

PROVED UNDEVELOPED RESERVES IN CANADA, KAZAKHSTAN, THE

UNITED STATES, AND THE NETHERLANDS HAVE REMAINED UNDEVELOPED FOR FIVE YEARS OR

MORE PRIMARILY DUE TO CONSTRAINTS ON THE CAPACITY OF INFRASTRUCTURE AND THE

PACE OF CO-VENTURER/GOVERNMENT FUNDING, AS WELL AS THE TIME REQUIRED TO

COMPLETE DEVELOPMENT FOR VERY LARGE PROJECTS. THE CORPORATION IS REASONABLY

CERTAIN THAT THESE PROVED RESERVES WILL BE PRODUCED; HOWEVER, THE TIMING AND

AMOUNT RECOVERED CAN BE AFFECTED BY A NUMBER OF FACTORS INCLUDING COMPLETION OF

DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS, RESERVOIR PERFORMANCE AND REGULATORY APPROVALS. OF THE

PROVED UNDEVELOPED RESERVES THAT HAVE BEEN REPORTED FOR FIVE OR MORE YEARS, 57

PERCENT ARE CONTAINED IN FOUR FIELDS IN CANADA, KAZAKHSTAN AND THE NETHERLANDS.

THE LARGEST OF THESE IS RELATED TO THE KEARL PROJECT IN CANADA, WHERE

CONSTRUCTION OF THE INITIAL DEVELOPMENT WAS COMPLETED DURING 2012 AND PHASED

START-UP ACTIVITIES WERE UNDER WAY. IN KAZAKHSTAN, THE PROVED UNDEVELOPED RESERVES

ARE RELATED TO THE INITIAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE OFFSHORE KASHAGAN FIELD WHICH IS

INCLUDED IN THE NORTH CASPIAN PRODUCTION SHARING AGREEMENT AND THE TENGIZCHEVROIL

JOINT VENTURE WHICH INCLUDES A PRODUCTION LICENSE IN THE TENGIZ – KOROLEV FIELD

COMPLEX. THE TENGIZCHEVROIL JOINT VENTURE IS PRODUCING, AND PROVED UNDEVELOPED

RESERVES WILL CONTINUE TO MOVE TO PROVED DEVELOPED AS APPROVED DEVELOPMENT

PHASES PROGRESS. THE FOURTH FIELD IS THE GRONINGEN GAS FIELD IN THE NETHERLANDS.

PROVED UNDEVELOPED RESERVES REPORTED FOR THIS FIELD ARE RELATED TO INSTALLATION

OF FUTURE STAGES OF COMPRESSION. THESE RESERVES WILL MOVE TO PROVED DEVELOPED

WHEN THE ADDITIONAL STAGES OF COMPRESSION ARE INSTALLED TO MAINTAIN FIELD

DELIVERY PRESSURE. THE REMAINDER OF PROVED UNDEVELOPED RESERVES ARE CONTAINED

IN OVER 140 FIELDS IN 16 COUNTRIES.

SYNCRUDE OPERATIONS.

SYNCRUDE IS A JOINT VENTURE ESTABLISHED TO RECOVER

SHALLOW DEPOSITS OF OIL SANDS USING OPEN-PIT MINING METHODS TO EXTRACT THE

CRUDE BITUMEN, AND THEN UPGRADE IT TO PRODUCE A HIGH-QUALITY, LIGHT (32 DEGREES

API), SWEET, SYNTHETIC CRUDE OIL. IMPERIAL OIL LIMITED IS THE OWNER OF A 25

PERCENT INTEREST IN THE JOINT VENTURE. EXXON MOBIL CORPORATION HAS A 69.6

PERCENT INTEREST IN IMPERIAL OIL LIMITED. IN 2012, THE COMPANY’S SHARE OF NET

PRODUCTION OF SYNTHETIC CRUDE OIL WAS ABOUT 69 THOUSAND BARRELS PER DAY AND

SHARE OF NET ACREAGE WAS ABOUT 63 THOUSAND ACRES IN THE ATHABASCA OIL

SANDS DEPOSIT.

KEARL PROJECT.

THE KEARL PROJECT IS A JOINT VENTURE ESTABLISHED TO

RECOVER SHALLOW DEPOSITS OF OIL SANDS USING OPEN-PIT MINING METHODS TO EXTRACT

THE CRUDE BITUMEN. IMPERIAL OIL LIMITED HOLDS A 70.96 PERCENT INTEREST IN THE

JOINT VENTURE AND EXXONMOBIL CANADA PROPERTIES HOLDS THE OTHER 29.04 PERCENT.

EXXON MOBIL CORPORATION HAS A 69.6 PERCENT INTEREST IN IMPERIAL OIL LIMITED AND

A 100 PERCENT INTEREST IN EXXONMOBIL CANADA PROPERTIES. KEARL IS COMPRISED OF

SIX OIL SANDS LEASES COVERING ABOUT 48 THOUSAND ACRES IN THE ATHABASCA OIL

SANDS DEPOSIT.

THE KEARL PROJECT IS LOCATED APPROXIMATELY 40 MILES

NORTH OF FORT MCMURRAY, ALBERTA, CANADA, AND IS EXPECTED TO BE DEVELOPED IN TWO

PHASES. BITUMEN WILL BE EXTRACTED FROM OIL SANDS PRODUCED FROM OPEN-PIT MINING

OPERATIONS, AND PROCESSED THROUGH A BITUMEN EXTRACTION AND FROTH TREATMENT

PLANT. THE PRODUCT, A BLEND OF BITUMEN AND DILUENT, IS PLANNED TO BE SHIPPED

VIA PIPELINES FOR DISTRIBUTION TO NORTH AMERICAN MARKETS. DILUENT IS NATURAL

GAS CONDENSATE OR OTHER LIGHT HYDROCARBONS ADDED TO THE CRUDE BITUMEN TO

FACILITATE TRANSPORTATION TO MARKET BY PIPELINE. AT YEAR-END 2012, THE

CONSTRUCTION OF THE INITIAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE KEARL PROJECT WAS COMPLETE AND

PHASED START-UP ACTIVITIES WERE UNDER WAY. CONSTRUCTION ON THE KEARL EXPANSION

PROJECT CONTINUED DURING 2012.

EXXONMOBIL’S INVESTMENT IN DEVELOPED AND UNDEVELOPED

ACREAGE IS COMPRISED OF NUMEROUS CONCESSIONS, BLOCKS AND LEASES. THE TERMS AND

CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH THE CORPORATION MAINTAINS EXPLORATION AND/OR PRODUCTION

RIGHTS TO THE ACREAGE ARE PROPERTY-SPECIFIC, CONTRACTUALLY DEFINED AND VARY

SIGNIFICANTLY FROM PROPERTY TO PROPERTY. WORK PROGRAMS ARE DESIGNED TO ENSURE

THAT THE EXPLORATION POTENTIAL OF ANY PROPERTY IS FULLY EVALUATED BEFORE

EXPIRATION. IN SOME INSTANCES, THE CORPORATION MAY ELECT TO RELINQUISH ACREAGE

IN ADVANCE OF THE CONTRACTUAL EXPIRATION DATE IF THE EVALUATION PROCESS IS

COMPLETE AND THERE IS NOT A BUSINESS BASIS FOR EXTENSION. IN CASES WHERE

ADDITIONAL TIME MAY BE REQUIRED TO FULLY EVALUATE ACREAGE, THE CORPORATION HAS

GENERALLY BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN OBTAINING EXTENSIONS. THE SCHEDULED EXPIRATION OF

LEASES AND CONCESSIONS FOR UNDEVELOPED ACREAGE OVER THE NEXT THREE YEARS IS NOT

EXPECTED TO HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON THE CORPORATION.

18

D. SUMMARY OF ACREAGE

TERMS

UNITED STATES

OIL AND GAS LEASES HAVE AN EXPLORATION PERIOD RANGING

FROM ONE TO TEN YEARS, AND A PRODUCTION PERIOD THAT NORMALLY REMAINS IN EFFECT

UNTIL PRODUCTION CEASES. UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES, A LEASE MAY BE HELD

BEYOND ITS EXPLORATION TERM EVEN IF PRODUCTION HAS NOT COMMENCED. IN SOME

INSTANCES, A “FEE INTEREST” IS ACQUIRED WHERE BOTH THE SURFACE AND THE

UNDERLYING MINERAL INTERESTS ARE OWNED OUTRIGHT.

CANADA / SOUTH AMERICA

CANADA

EXPLORATION LICENSES OR LEASES IN ONSHORE AREAS ARE ACQUIRED

FOR VARYING PERIODS OF TIME WITH RENEWALS OR EXTENSIONS POSSIBLE. THESE

LICENSES OR LEASES ENTITLE THE HOLDER TO CONTINUE EXISTING LICENSES OR LEASES

UPON COMPLETING SPECIFIED WORK. IN GENERAL, THESE LICENSE AND LEASE AGREEMENTS

ARE HELD AS LONG AS THERE IS PRODUCTION ON THE LICENSES AND LEASES. EXPLORATION

LICENSES IN OFFSHORE EASTERN CANADA AND THE BEAUFORT SEA ARE HELD BY WORK

COMMITMENTS OF VARIOUS AMOUNTS AND RENTALS. THEY ARE VALID FOR A MAXIMUM TERM

OF NINE YEARS. PRODUCTION LICENSES IN THE OFFSHORE ARE VALID FOR 25 YEARS, WITH

RIGHTS OF EXTENSION FOR CONTINUED PRODUCTION. SIGNIFICANT DISCOVERY LICENSES IN

THE OFFSHORE, RELATING TO CURRENTLY UNDEVELOPED DISCOVERIES, DO NOT HAVE A

DEFINITE TERM.

ARGENTINA

THE FEDERAL ONSHORE CONCESSION TERMS IN ARGENTINA ARE

UP TO FOUR YEARS FOR THE INITIAL EXPLORATION PERIOD, UP TO THREE YEARS FOR THE

SECOND EXPLORATION PERIOD AND UP TO TWO YEARS FOR THE THIRD EXPLORATION PERIOD.

A 50-PERCENT RELINQUISHMENT IS REQUIRED AFTER EACH EXPLORATION PERIOD. AN EXTENSION

AFTER THE THIRD EXPLORATION PERIOD IS POSSIBLE FOR UP TO FIVE YEARS. THE TOTAL

PRODUCTION TERM IS 25 YEARS WITH A TEN-YEAR EXTENSION POSSIBLE, ONCE A FIELD

HAS BEEN DEVELOPED. ARGENTINE PROVINCES ARE ENTITLED TO MODIFY THE CONCESSION

TERMS GRANTED WITHIN THEIR TERRITORIES. THE CONCESSION TERMS OF THE EXPLORATION

PERMITS GRANTED BY NEUQUEN PROVINCE ARE UP TO SIX YEARS FOR THE INITIAL

EXPLORATION PERIOD, UP TO FOUR YEARS FOR THE SECOND EXPLORATION PERIOD AND UP

TO THREE YEARS FOR THE THIRD EXPLORATION PERIOD DEPENDING ON THE CLASSIFICATION

NETHERLANDS

UNDER THE MINING LAW, EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2003,

EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION LICENSES FOR BOTH ONSHORE AND OFFSHORE AREAS ARE

ISSUED FOR A PERIOD AS EXPLICITLY DEFINED IN THE LICENSE. THE TERM IS BASED ON

THE PERIOD OF TIME NECESSARY TO PERFORM THE ACTIVITIES FOR WHICH THE LICENSE IS

ISSUED. LICENSE CONDITIONS ARE STIPULATED IN THE LICENSE AND ARE BASED ON THE

MINING LAW.

PRODUCTION RIGHTS GRANTED PRIOR TO JANUARY 1, 2003,

REMAIN SUBJECT TO THEIR EXISTING TERMS, AND DIFFER SLIGHTLY FOR ONSHORE AND

OFFSHORE AREAS. ONSHORE PRODUCTION LICENSES ISSUED PRIOR TO 1988 WERE

INDEFINITE; FROM 1988 THEY WERE ISSUED FOR A PERIOD AS EXPLICITLY DEFINED IN

THE LICENSE, RANGING FROM 35 TO 45 YEARS. OFFSHORE PRODUCTION LICENSES ISSUED

BEFORE 1976 WERE ISSUED FOR A FIXED PERIOD OF 40 YEARS; FROM 1976 THEY WERE

AGAIN ISSUED FOR A PERIOD AS EXPLICITLY DEFINED IN THE LICENSE, RANGING FROM 15

TO 40 YEARS.

NORWAY

LICENSES ISSUED PRIOR TO 1972 WERE FOR AN INITIAL

PERIOD OF SIX YEARS AND AN EXTENSION PERIOD OF 40 YEARS, WITH RELINQUISHMENT OF

AT LEAST ONE-FOURTH OF THE ORIGINAL AREA REQUIRED AT THE END OF THE SIXTH YEAR

AND ANOTHER ONE-FOURTH AT THE END OF THE NINTH YEAR. LICENSES ISSUED BETWEEN

1972 AND 1997 WERE FOR AN INITIAL PERIOD OF UP TO SIX YEARS (WITH EXTENSION OF

THE INITIAL PERIOD OF ONE YEAR AT A TIME UP TO TEN YEARS AFTER 1985), AND AN

EXTENSION PERIOD OF UP TO 30 YEARS, WITH RELINQUISHMENT OF AT LEAST ONE-HALF OF

THE ORIGINAL AREA REQUIRED AT THE END OF THE INITIAL PERIOD. LICENSES ISSUED

AFTER JULY 1, 1997, HAVE AN INITIAL PERIOD OF UP TO TEN YEARS AND A NORMAL

EXTENSION PERIOD OF UP TO 30 YEARS OR IN SPECIAL CASES OF UP TO 50 YEARS, AND

WITH RELINQUISHMENT OF AT LEAST ONE-HALF OF THE ORIGINAL AREA REQUIRED AT THE

END OF THE INITIAL PERIOD.

19

UNITED

KINGDOM

ACREAGE TERMS ARE FIXED BY THE GOVERNMENT AND ARE

PERIODICALLY CHANGED. FOR EXAMPLE, MANY OF THE EARLY LICENSES ISSUED UNDER THE

FIRST FOUR LICENSING ROUNDS PROVIDED FOR AN INITIAL TERM OF SIX YEARS WITH

RELINQUISHMENT OF AT LEAST ONE-HALF OF THE ORIGINAL AREA AT THE END OF THE

INITIAL TERM, SUBJECT TO EXTENSION FOR A FURTHER 40 YEARS. AT THE END OF ANY

SUCH 40-YEAR TERM, LICENSES MAY CONTINUE IN PRODUCING AREAS UNTIL CESSATION OF

PRODUCTION; OR LICENSES MAY CONTINUE IN DEVELOPMENT AREAS FOR PERIODS AGREED ON

A CASE-BY-CASE BASIS UNTIL THEY BECOME PRODUCING AREAS; OR LICENSES TERMINATE

IN ALL OTHER AREAS. THE LICENSING REGIME WAS LAST UPDATED IN 2002, AND THE

MAJORITY OF LICENSES ISSUED HAVE AN INITIAL TERM OF FOUR YEARS WITH A SECOND

AFRICA

ANGOLA

EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION ACTIVITIES ARE GOVERNED BY

PRODUCTION SHARING AGREEMENTS WITH AN INITIAL EXPLORATION TERM OF FOUR YEARS

AND AN OPTIONAL SECOND PHASE OF TWO TO THREE YEARS. THE PRODUCTION PERIOD IS

FOR 25 YEARS, AND AGREEMENTS GENERALLY PROVIDE FOR A NEGOTIATED EXTENSION.

CHAD

EXPLORATION PERMITS ARE ISSUED FOR A PERIOD OF FIVE

YEARS, AND ARE RENEWABLE FOR ONE OR TWO FURTHER FIVE-YEAR PERIODS. THE TERMS

AND CONDITIONS OF THE PERMITS, INCLUDING RELINQUISHMENT OBLIGATIONS, ARE

SPECIFIED IN A NEGOTIATED CONVENTION. THE PRODUCTION TERM IS FOR 30 YEARS AND

MAY BE EXTENDED AT THE DISCRETION OF THE GOVERNMENT.

EQUATORIAL GUINEA

EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION ACTIVITIES ARE GOVERNED BY

PRODUCTION SHARING CONTRACTS NEGOTIATED WITH THE STATE MINISTRY OF MINES,

INDUSTRY AND ENERGY. THE EXPLORATION PERIODS ARE FOR TEN TO 15 YEARS WITH

LIMITED RELINQUISHMENTS IN THE ABSENCE OF COMMERCIAL DISCOVERIES. THE

PRODUCTION PERIOD FOR CRUDE OIL IS 30 YEARS, WHILE THE PRODUCTION PERIOD FOR

GAS IS 50 YEARS. UNDER THE HYDROCARBONS LAW ENACTED IN 2006, THE EXPLORATION

TERMS FOR NEW PRODUCTION SHARING CONTRACTS ARE FOUR TO FIVE YEARS WITH A

NIGERIA

EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION ACTIVITIES IN THE DEEPWATER

OFFSHORE AREAS ARE TYPICALLY GOVERNED BY PRODUCTION SHARING CONTRACTS (PSCS)

WITH THE NATIONAL OIL COMPANY, THE NIGERIAN NATIONAL PETROLEUM CORPORATION

(NNPC). NNPC HOLDS THE UNDERLYING OIL PROSPECTING LICENSE (OPL) AND ANY

RESULTING OIL MINING LEASE (OML). THE TERMS OF THE PSCS ARE GENERALLY 30 YEARS,

INCLUDING A TEN-YEAR EXPLORATION PERIOD (AN INITIAL EXPLORATION PHASE PLUS ONE

OR TWO OPTIONAL PERIODS) COVERED BY AN OPL. UPON COMMERCIAL DISCOVERY, AN OPL

MAY BE CONVERTED TO AN OML. PARTIAL RELINQUISHMENT IS REQUIRED UNDER THE PSC AT

THE END OF THE TEN-YEAR EXPLORATION PERIOD, AND OMLS HAVE A 20-YEAR PRODUCTION

PERIOD THAT MAY BE EXTENDED.

SOME EXPLORATION ACTIVITIES ARE CARRIED OUT IN

DEEPWATER BY JOINT VENTURES WITH LOCAL COMPANIES HOLDING INTERESTS IN AN OPL.

OPLS IN DEEPWATER OFFSHORE AREAS ARE VALID FOR TEN YEARS AND ARE NON-RENEWABLE,

WHILE IN ALL OTHER AREAS THE LICENSES ARE FOR FIVE YEARS AND ALSO ARE

NON-RENEWABLE. DEMONSTRATING A COMMERCIAL DISCOVERY IS THE BASIS FOR CONVERSION

OF AN OPL TO AN OML.

OMLS GRANTED PRIOR TO THE 1969 PETROLEUM ACT (I.E.,

UNDER THE MINERAL OILS ACT 1914, REPEALED BY THE 1969 PETROLEUM ACT) WERE FOR

30 YEARS ONSHORE AND 40 YEARS IN OFFSHORE AREAS AND HAVE BEEN RENEWED,

EFFECTIVE DECEMBER 1, 2008, FOR A FURTHER PERIOD OF 20 YEARS, WITH A FURTHER

RENEWAL OPTION OF 20 YEARS. OPERATIONS UNDER THESE PRE-1969 OMLS ARE CONDUCTED

UNDER A JOINT VENTURE AGREEMENT WITH NNPC RATHER THAN A PSC. IN 2000, A

MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING (MOU) WAS EXECUTED DEFINING COMMERCIAL TERMS

APPLICABLE TO EXISTING JOINT VENTURE OIL PRODUCTION. THE MOU MAY BE TERMINATED

ON ONE CALENDAR YEAR’S NOTICE.

OMLS GRANTED UNDER THE 1969 PETROLEUM ACT, WHICH

INCLUDE ALL DEEPWATER OMLS, HAVE A MAXIMUM TERM OF 20 YEARS WITHOUT DISTINCTION

FOR ONSHORE OR OFFSHORE LOCATION AND ARE RENEWABLE, UPON 12 MONTHS’ WRITTEN

NOTICE, FOR ANOTHER PERIOD OF 20 YEARS. OMLS NOT HELD BY NNPC ARE ALSO SUBJECT

TO A MANDATORY 50-PERCENT RELINQUISHMENT AFTER THE FIRST TEN YEARS OF THEIR

DURATION.

GENERALLY GOVERNED BY COOPERATION CONTRACTS, USUALLY IN THE FORM OF A

PRODUCTION SHARING CONTRACT (PSC), NEGOTIATED WITH BPMIGAS, A GOVERNMENT AGENCY

ESTABLISHED IN 2002 TO MANAGE UPSTREAM OIL AND GAS ACTIVITIES. IN 2012,

INDONESIA’S CONSTITUTIONAL COURT RULED CERTAIN ARTICLES OF LAW RELATING TO

BPMIGAS TO BE UNCONSTITUTIONAL, BUT STATED THAT ALL EXISTING PSCS SIGNED WITH

BPMIGAS SHOULD REMAIN IN FORCE UNTIL THEIR EXPIRY, AND THE FUNCTIONS AND DUTIES

PREVIOUSLY PERFORMED BY BPMIGAS ARE TO BE CARRIED OUT BY THE RELEVANT MINISTRY

OF THE GOVERNMENT OF INDONESIA UNTIL THE PROMULGATION OF A NEW OIL AND GAS LAW.

THE CURRENT PSCS HAVE AN EXPLORATION PERIOD OF SIX YEARS, WHICH CAN BE EXTENDED

UP TO 10 YEARS, AND AN EXPLOITATION PERIOD OF 20 YEARS. PSCS GENERALLY REQUIRE

THE CONTRACTOR TO RELINQUISH 10 PERCENT TO 20 PERCENT OF THE CONTRACT AREA

AFTER THREE YEARS AND GENERALLY ALLOW THE CONTRACTOR TO RETAIN NO MORE THAN 50

PERCENT TO 80 PERCENT OF THE ORIGINAL CONTRACT AREA AFTER SIX YEARS, DEPENDING

ON THE ACREAGE AND TERMS.

IRAQ

COMPANIES OF THE IRAQI MINISTRY OF OIL. AN EXXONMOBIL AFFILIATE ENTERED INTO A

CONTRACT WITH SOUTH OIL COMPANY OF THE IRAQI MINISTRY OF OIL FOR THE RIGHTS TO

PARTICIPATE IN THE DEVELOPMENT AND PRODUCTION ACTIVITIES OF THE WEST QURNA

PHASE I OIL AND GAS FIELD EFFECTIVE MARCH 1, 2010. THE TERM OF THE

OVERALL TERM OF 24 TO 38 YEARS, DEPENDING ON WATER DEPTH, WITH POSSIBLE

EXTENSIONS TO THE EXPLORATION AND/OR DEVELOPMENT PERIODS. THE EXPLORATION

PERIOD IS FIVE TO SEVEN YEARS WITH THE POSSIBILITY OF EXTENSIONS, AFTER WHICH

TIME AREAS WITH NO COMMERCIAL DISCOVERIES WILL BE DEEMED RELINQUISHED. THE

DEVELOPMENT PERIOD IS FROM FOUR TO SIX YEARS FROM COMMERCIAL DISCOVERY, WITH

THE POSSIBILITY OF EXTENSIONS UNDER SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES. AREAS FROM WHICH

COMMERCIAL PRODUCTION HAS NOT STARTED BY THE END OF THE DEVELOPMENT PERIOD WILL

BE DEEMED RELINQUISHED IF NO EXTENSION IS GRANTED. ALL EXTENSIONS ARE SUBJECT

TO THE NATIONAL OIL COMPANY’S PRIOR WRITTEN APPROVAL. THE TOTAL PRODUCTION

PERIOD IS 15 TO 25 YEARS FROM FIRST COMMERCIAL LIFTING, NOT TO EXCEED THE

OVERALL TERM OF THE CONTRACT.

IN 2008, THE COMPANY REACHED AGREEMENT WITH THE

NATIONAL OIL COMPANY FOR A NEW PSC, WHICH WAS SUBSEQUENTLY SIGNED IN 2009.

UNDER THE NEW PSC, FROM 2008 UNTIL MARCH 31, 2012, THE COMPANY WAS ENTITLED TO

UNDERTAKE NEW DEVELOPMENT AND PRODUCTION ACTIVITIES IN OIL FIELDS UNDER AN

EXISTING PSC, SUBJECT TO NEW MINIMUM WORK AND SPENDING COMMITMENTS, INCLUDING

AN ENHANCED OIL RECOVERY PROJECT IN ONE OF THE OIL FIELDS. WHEN THE EXISTING

PSC EXPIRED ON MARCH 31, 2012, THE PRODUCING FIELDS COVERED BY THE EXISTING PSC

AUTOMATICALLY BECAME PART OF THE NEW PSC, WHICH HAS A 25-YEAR DURATION FROM

IRAN THREAT

REDUCTION AND SYRIA HUMAN RIGHTS ACT OF 2012

THE CAPTIONED ACT WAS SIGNED BY PRESIDENT OBAMA ON

AUGUST 10, 2012.  AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE ACT EXTENDED THE PROHIBITION AGAINST

U.S. PERSONS DOING BUSINESS WITH THE GOVERNMENT OF IRAN TO INCLUDE SUCH PERSONS’

NON-U.S. SUBSIDIARIES.  PREVIOUSLY, NON-U.S. SUBSIDIARIES WERE NOT COVERED BY

THIS RESTRICTION.  APPLICATION OF THE RESTRICTION TO NON-U.S. SUBSIDIARIES TOOK

EFFECT ON OCTOBER 10, 2012.  THE ACT ALSO REQUIRES REGISTRANTS TO DISCLOSE, IN

THEIR ANNUAL AND QUARTERLY REPORTS, ACTIVITIES COVERED BY THE ACT WHICH

OCCURRED ANYTIME DURING THE PERIOD COVERED BY THE REPORT, EVEN IF SUCH

ACTIVITIES OCCURRED PRIOR TO THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF THE ACT AND WERE PERMITTED

AT THE TIME.

DURING THE PERIOD FROM JANUARY TO SEPTEMBER, 2012,

EXXONMOBIL’S MAJORITY-OWNED CANADIAN AFFILIATE, IMPERIAL OIL LIMITED (IOL),

MADE SEVERAL FLEET SALES OF MOTOR FUEL WITH AN AGGREGATE TOTAL SALES PRICE OF

APPROXIMATELY 11,000 CANADIAN DOLLARS TO THE IRANIAN EMBASSY IN CANADA.  IOL’S

NET PROFITS ATTRIBUTABLE TO THESE SALES WERE LESS THAN 500 CANADIAN DOLLARS.

THE SALES WERE MADE WITHOUT THE INVOLVEMENT OF ANY U.S. PERSON AND WERE

PERMITTED BY U.S. LAWS IN EFFECT AT THE TIME.  NO SALES OCCURRED AFTER THE

OCTOBER 10, 2012, EFFECTIVE DATE, AND WE DO NOT EXPECT ANY SUCH SALES TO OCCUR

IN THE FUTURE.

THE EMBASSY SALES STATED ABOVE REPRESENT AN ACTIVITY

DESCRIBED IN PARAGRAPH (D)(III) OF PARAGRAPH (1) OF SECTION 13(R) OF THE

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934 AND THEREFORE ARE EXCLUDED FROM THE

FREQUENTLY USED TERMS

LISTED BELOW ARE DEFINITIONS OF SEVERAL OF EXXONMOBIL’S

KEY BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE MEASURES. THESE DEFINITIONS ARE PROVIDED

TO FACILITATE UNDERSTANDING OF THE TERMS AND THEIR CALCULATION.

CASH FLOW FROM OPERATIONS AND ASSET SALES

CASH FLOW

FROM OPERATIONS AND ASSET SALES IS THE SUM OF THE NET CASH PROVIDED BY

OPERATING ACTIVITIES AND PROCEEDS ASSOCIATED WITH SALES OF SUBSIDIARIES,

PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT, AND SALES AND RETURNS OF INVESTMENTS FROM THE

CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS. THIS CASH FLOW REFLECTS THE TOTAL SOURCES

OF CASH FROM BOTH OPERATING THE CORPORATION’S ASSETS AND FROM THE DIVESTING OF

ASSETS. THE CORPORATION EMPLOYS A LONG-STANDING AND REGULAR DISCIPLINED REVIEW

PROCESS TO ENSURE THAT ALL ASSETS ARE CONTRIBUTING TO THE CORPORATION’S

STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES. ASSETS ARE DIVESTED WHEN THEY ARE NO LONGER MEETING THESE

OBJECTIVES OR ARE WORTH CONSIDERABLY MORE TO OTHERS. BECAUSE OF THE REGULAR

NATURE OF THIS ACTIVITY, WE BELIEVE IT IS USEFUL FOR INVESTORS TO CONSIDER

PROCEEDS ASSOCIATED WITH ASSET SALES TOGETHER WITH CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING

ACTIVITIES WHEN EVALUATING CASH AVAILABLE FOR INVESTMENT IN THE BUSINESS AND

FINANCING ACTIVITIES, INCLUDING SHAREHOLDER DISTRIBUTIONS.

HOW THE CAPITAL IS USED BY THE BUSINESSES, IT INCLUDES EXXONMOBIL’S NET SHARE

OF PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT AND OTHER ASSETS LESS LIABILITIES, EXCLUDING

BOTH SHORT-TERM AND LONG-TERM DEBT. WHEN VIEWED FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF THE

SOURCES OF CAPITAL EMPLOYED IN TOTAL FOR THE CORPORATION, IT INCLUDES

EXXONMOBIL’S SHARE OF TOTAL DEBT AND EQUITY. BOTH OF THESE VIEWS INCLUDE

EXXONMOBIL’S SHARE OF AMOUNTS APPLICABLE TO EQUITY COMPANIES, WHICH THE

CORPORATION BELIEVES SHOULD BE INCLUDED TO PROVIDE A MORE COMPREHENSIVE MEASURE

OF CAPITAL EMPLOYED.

FREQUENTLY USED TERMS

RETURN ON AVERAGE CAPITAL EMPLOYED

RETURN ON

AVERAGE CAPITAL EMPLOYED (ROCE) IS A PERFORMANCE MEASURE RATIO. FROM THE

PERSPECTIVE OF THE BUSINESS SEGMENTS, ROCE IS ANNUAL BUSINESS SEGMENT EARNINGS

DIVIDED BY AVERAGE BUSINESS SEGMENT CAPITAL EMPLOYED (AVERAGE OF BEGINNING AND

END-OF-YEAR AMOUNTS). THESE SEGMENT EARNINGS INCLUDE EXXONMOBIL’S SHARE OF

SEGMENT EARNINGS OF EQUITY COMPANIES, CONSISTENT WITH OUR CAPITAL EMPLOYED

DEFINITION, AND EXCLUDE THE COST OF FINANCING. THE CORPORATION’S TOTAL ROCE IS

NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO EXXONMOBIL EXCLUDING THE AFTER-TAX COST OF

FINANCING, DIVIDED BY TOTAL CORPORATE AVERAGE CAPITAL EMPLOYED. THE CORPORATION

HAS CONSISTENTLY APPLIED ITS ROCE DEFINITION FOR MANY YEARS AND VIEWS IT AS THE

BEST MEASURE OF HISTORICAL CAPITAL PRODUCTIVITY IN OUR CAPITAL-INTENSIVE,

LONG-TERM INDUSTRY, BOTH TO EVALUATE MANAGEMENT’S PERFORMANCE AND TO

DEMONSTRATE TO SHAREHOLDERS THAT CAPITAL HAS BEEN USED WISELY OVER THE LONG

TERM. ADDITIONAL MEASURES, WHICH ARE MORE CASH FLOW BASED, ARE USED TO MAKE INVESTMENT

DECISIONS.

DEMAND GROWTH AND ENERGY SOURCE MIX; CAPACITY INCREASES; PRODUCTION GROWTH AND

MIX; RATES OF FIELD DECLINE; FINANCING SOURCES; THE RESOLUTION OF CONTINGENCIES

AND UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS; ENVIRONMENTAL AND CAPITAL EXPENDITURES; COULD

DIFFER MATERIALLY DEPENDING ON A NUMBER OF FACTORS, SUCH AS CHANGES IN THE

THE TERM “PROJECT” AS USED IN THIS REPORT DOES NOT NECESSARILY HAVE THE

SAME MEANING AS UNDER SEC RULE 13Q-1 RELATING TO GOVERNMENT PAYMENT REPORTING.

FOR EXAMPLE, A SINGLE PROJECT FOR PURPOSES OF THE RULE MAY ENCOMPASS NUMEROUS

PROPERTIES, AGREEMENTS, INVESTMENTS, DEVELOPMENTS, PHASES, WORK EFFORTS,

OVERVIEW

THE

FOLLOWING DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF EXXONMOBIL’S FINANCIAL RESULTS, AS WELL AS

THE ACCOMPANYING FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND RELATED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS TO WHICH THEY REFER, ARE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE

MANAGEMENT OF EXXON MOBIL CORPORATION. THE CORPORATION’S ACCOUNTING AND

FINANCIAL REPORTING FAIRLY REFLECT ITS STRAIGHTFORWARD BUSINESS MODEL INVOLVING

THE EXTRACTING, MANUFACTURING AND MARKETING OF HYDROCARBONS AND

HYDROCARBON-BASED PRODUCTS. THE CORPORATION’S BUSINESS MODEL INVOLVES THE

PRODUCTION (OR PURCHASE), MANUFACTURE AND SALE OF PHYSICAL PRODUCTS, AND ALL

COMMERCIAL ACTIVITIES ARE DIRECTLY IN SUPPORT OF THE UNDERLYING PHYSICAL

MOVEMENT OF GOODS.

EXXONMOBIL, WITH ITS RESOURCE BASE, FINANCIAL STRENGTH, DISCIPLINED

INVESTMENT APPROACH AND TECHNOLOGY PORTFOLIO, IS WELL-POSITIONED TO PARTICIPATE

IN SUBSTANTIAL INVESTMENTS TO DEVELOP NEW ENERGY SUPPLIES. WHILE COMMODITY

PRICES ARE VOLATILE ON A SHORT-TERM BASIS AND DEPEND ON SUPPLY AND DEMAND,

EXXONMOBIL’S INVESTMENT DECISIONS ARE BASED ON OUR LONG-TERM BUSINESS OUTLOOK,

USING A DISCIPLINED APPROACH IN SELECTING AND PURSUING THE MOST ATTRACTIVE

INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES. THE CORPORATE PLAN IS A FUNDAMENTAL ANNUAL MANAGEMENT

PROCESS THAT IS THE BASIS FOR SETTING NEAR-TERM OPERATING AND CAPITAL

OBJECTIVES IN ADDITION TO PROVIDING THE LONGER-TERM ECONOMIC ASSUMPTIONS USED

FOR INVESTMENT EVALUATION PURPOSES. VOLUMES ARE BASED ON INDIVIDUAL FIELD

PRODUCTION PROFILES, WHICH ARE ALSO UPDATED ANNUALLY. PRICE RANGES FOR CRUDE

OIL, NATURAL GAS, REFINED PRODUCTS, AND CHEMICAL PRODUCTS ARE BASED ON

CORPORATE PLAN ASSUMPTIONS DEVELOPED ANNUALLY BY MAJOR REGION AND ARE UTILIZED

FOR INVESTMENT EVALUATION PURPOSES. POTENTIAL INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES ARE

TESTED OVER A WIDE RANGE OF ECONOMIC SCENARIOS TO ESTABLISH THE RESILIENCY OF

EACH OPPORTUNITY. ONCE INVESTMENTS ARE MADE, A REAPPRAISAL PROCESS IS COMPLETED

TO ENSURE RELEVANT LESSONS ARE LEARNED AND IMPROVEMENTS ARE INCORPORATED INTO

FUTURE PROJECTS.

BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT AND RISK ASSESSMENT

LONG-TERM BUSINESS OUTLOOK

BY 2040, THE

WORLD’S POPULATION IS PROJECTED TO GROW TO APPROXIMATELY 8.7 BILLION PEOPLE, OR

ABOUT 1.9 BILLION MORE THAN IN 2010. COINCIDENT WITH THIS POPULATION INCREASE,

THE CORPORATION EXPECTS WORLDWIDE ECONOMIC GROWTH TO AVERAGE CLOSE TO 3 PERCENT

PER YEAR. EXPANDING PROSPERITY ACROSS A GROWING GLOBAL POPULATION IS EXPECTED

TO COINCIDE WITH AN INCREASE IN PRIMARY ENERGY DEMAND OF ABOUT 35 PERCENT BY

2040 VERSUS 2010, EVEN WITH SUBSTANTIAL EFFICIENCY GAINS AROUND THE WORLD. THIS

DEMAND INCREASE IS EXPECTED TO BE CONCENTRATED IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES (I.E.,

THOSE THAT ARE NOT MEMBER NATIONS OF THE ORGANIZATION FOR ECONOMIC COOPERATION

AND DEVELOPMENT).

AS ECONOMIC PROGRESS FOR BILLIONS OF PEOPLE DRIVES DEMAND HIGHER,

INCREASING PENETRATION OF ENERGY-EFFICIENT AND LOWER-EMISSION FUELS,

TECHNOLOGIES AND PRACTICES ARE EXPECTED TO CONTRIBUTE TO SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER

LEVELS OF ENERGY CONSUMPTION AND EMISSIONS PER UNIT OF ECONOMIC OUTPUT OVER

TIME. EFFICIENCY GAINS WILL RESULT FROM ANTICIPATED IMPROVEMENTS IN THE

TRANSPORTATION AND POWER GENERATION SECTORS, DRIVEN BY THE PENETRATION OF

ADVANCED TECHNOLOGIES, AS WELL AS MANY OTHER IMPROVEMENTS THAT SPAN THE

RESIDENTIAL, COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL SECTORS.

ENERGY FOR TRANSPORTATION – INCLUDING CARS, TRUCKS, SHIPS, TRAINS AND

AIRPLANES – IS EXPECTED TO INCREASE BY ABOUT 40 PERCENT FROM 2010 TO 2040. THE

GLOBAL GROWTH IN TRANSPORTATION DEMAND IS LIKELY TO ACCOUNT FOR APPROXIMATELY

70 PERCENT OF THE GROWTH IN LIQUID FUELS DEMAND OVER THIS PERIOD. NEARLY ALL

THE WORLD’S TRANSPORTATION FLEETS WILL CONTINUE TO RUN ON LIQUID FUELS BECAUSE

THEY PROVIDE A LARGE QUANTITY OF ENERGY IN SMALL VOLUMES, MAKING THEM EASY TO TRANSPORT

AND WIDELY AVAILABLE.

DEMAND FOR ELECTRICITY AROUND THE WORLD IS LIKELY TO INCREASE

APPROXIMATELY 85 PERCENT BY 2040, LED BY GROWTH IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES.

CONSISTENT WITH THIS PROJECTION, POWER GENERATION IS EXPECTED TO REMAIN THE

LARGEST AND FASTEST-GROWING MAJOR SEGMENT OF GLOBAL ENERGY DEMAND. MEETING THE

EXPECTED GROWTH IN POWER DEMAND WILL REQUIRE A DIVERSE SET OF ENERGY SOURCES.

NATURAL GAS DEMAND IS LIKELY TO GROW MOST SIGNIFICANTLY AND BECOME THE LEADING

SOURCE OF GENERATED ELECTRICITY BY 2040, REFLECTING THE EFFICIENCY OF GAS-FIRED

POWER PLANTS.  TODAY, COAL HAS THE LARGEST FUEL SHARE IN THE POWER SECTOR, BUT

ITS SHARE IS LIKELY TO DECLINE

41

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL

CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

SIGNIFICANTLY BY 2040

AS POLICIES ARE GRADUALLY ADOPTED TO REDUCE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS INCLUDING

THOSE RELATED TO LOCAL AIR QUALITY AND GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS.  NUCLEAR POWER

AND RENEWABLES, LED BY WIND, ARE EXPECTED TO GROW SIGNIFICANTLY OVER THE

PERIOD.

LIQUID FUELS PROVIDE THE LARGEST SHARE OF ENERGY SUPPLY TODAY DUE TO

THEIR BROAD-BASED AVAILABILITY, AFFORDABILITY AND EASE OF TRANSPORT TO MEET

CONSUMER NEEDS. BY 2040, GLOBAL DEMAND FOR LIQUIDS IS EXPECTED TO GROW TO

APPROXIMATELY 113 MILLION BARRELS OF OIL-EQUIVALENT PER DAY, AN INCREASE OF ABOUT

30 PERCENT FROM 2010. GLOBAL DEMAND FOR LIQUID FUELS WILL BE MET BY A WIDE

VARIETY OF SOURCES. CONVENTIONAL CRUDE AND CONDENSATE PRODUCTION IS EXPECTED TO

REMAIN RELATIVELY FLAT THROUGH 2040. HOWEVER, GROWTH IS EXPECTED FROM A WIDE

VARIETY OF SOURCES, INCLUDING DEEP-WATER RESOURCES, OIL SANDS, TIGHT OIL,

NATURAL GAS LIQUIDS, AND BIOFUELS.  THE WORLD’S RESOURCE BASE IS SUFFICIENT TO

MEET PROJECTED DEMAND THROUGH 2040 AS TECHNOLOGY ADVANCES CONTINUE TO EXPAND

THE AVAILABILITY OF ECONOMIC SUPPLY OPTIONS. HOWEVER, ACCESS TO RESOURCES AND

TIMELY INVESTMENTS WILL REMAIN CRITICAL TO MEETING GLOBAL NEEDS WITH RELIABLE,

AFFORDABLE SUPPLIES.

NATURAL GAS IS A VERSATILE FUEL FOR A WIDE VARIETY OF APPLICATIONS, AND

IS EXPECTED TO BE THE FASTEST GROWING MAJOR FUEL SOURCE THROUGH 2040.  GLOBAL

DEMAND IS EXPECTED TO RISE ABOUT 65 PERCENT FROM 2010 TO 2040, WITH DEMAND

INCREASES IN MAJOR REGIONS AROUND THE WORLD REQUIRING NEW SOURCES OF SUPPLY.

HELPING MEET THESE NEEDS WILL BE SIGNIFICANT GROWTH IN SUPPLIES OF UNCONVENTIONAL

GAS – THE NATURAL GAS FOUND IN SHALE AND OTHER ROCK FORMATIONS THAT WAS ONCE

CONSIDERED UNECONOMIC TO PRODUCE.  BY 2040, UNCONVENTIONAL GAS IS LIKELY TO

APPROACH ONE-THIRD OF GLOBAL GAS SUPPLIES, UP FROM LESS THAN 15 PERCENT IN

2010.  GROWING NATURAL GAS DEMAND WILL ALSO STIMULATE SIGNIFICANT GROWTH IN THE

WORLDWIDE LIQUEFIED NATURAL GAS (LNG) MARKET, WHICH IS EXPECTED TO REACH ABOUT

15 PERCENT OF GLOBAL GAS DEMAND BY 2040.

THE WORLD’S ENERGY MIX IS HIGHLY DIVERSE AND WILL REMAIN SO THROUGH

2040. OIL IS EXPECTED TO REMAIN THE LARGEST SOURCE OF ENERGY WITH ITS SHARE

REMAINING CLOSE TO ONE-THIRD IN 2040.  COAL IS CURRENTLY THE SECOND LARGEST

SOURCE OF ENERGY, BUT IT IS LIKELY TO LOSE THAT POSITION TO NATURAL GAS BY

APPROXIMATELY 2025.  THE SHARE OF NATURAL GAS IS EXPECTED TO EXCEED 25 PERCENT

BY 2040, WHILE THE SHARE OF COAL FALLS TO LESS THAN 20 PERCENT. NUCLEAR POWER

IS PROJECTED TO GROW SIGNIFICANTLY, ALBEIT AT A SLOWER PACE THAN OTHERWISE

EXPECTED IN THE AFTERMATH OF THE FUKUSHIMA INCIDENT IN JAPAN FOLLOWING THE

EARTHQUAKE AND TSUNAMI IN MARCH 2011.  TOTAL RENEWABLE ENERGY IS LIKELY TO

REACH CLOSE TO 15 PERCENT OF TOTAL ENERGY BY 2040, INCLUDING BIOMASS, HYDRO AND

GEOTHERMAL AT A COMBINED SHARE OF ABOUT 11 PERCENT.  TOTAL ENERGY SUPPLIED FROM

WIND, SOLAR AND BIOFUELS IS EXPECTED TO INCREASE CLOSE TO 450 PERCENT FROM 2010

TO 2040, REACHING A COMBINED SHARE OF 3 TO 4 PERCENT OF WORLD ENERGY.

THE CORPORATION ANTICIPATES THAT THE WORLD’S AVAILABLE OIL AND GAS

RESOURCE BASE WILL GROW NOT ONLY FROM NEW DISCOVERIES, BUT ALSO FROM RESERVE

INCREASES IN PREVIOUSLY DISCOVERED FIELDS.  TECHNOLOGY WILL UNDERPIN THESE

INCREASES. THE COST TO DEVELOP AND SUPPLY THESE RESOURCES WILL BE SIGNIFICANT.

ACCORDING TO THE INTERNATIONAL ENERGY AGENCY, THE INVESTMENT REQUIRED TO MEET TOTAL

OIL AND GAS ENERGY NEEDS WORLDWIDE OVER THE PERIOD 2012-2035 WILL BE CLOSE TO

$19 TRILLION (MEASURED IN 2011 DOLLARS) OR CLOSE TO $800 BILLION PER YEAR ON

AVERAGE.

INTERNATIONAL ACCORDS AND UNDERLYING REGIONAL AND NATIONAL REGULATIONS

FOR GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION ARE EVOLVING WITH UNCERTAIN TIMING AND OUTCOME,

MAKING IT DIFFICULT TO PREDICT THEIR BUSINESS IMPACT.  EXXONMOBIL INCLUDES

ESTIMATES OF POTENTIAL COSTS RELATED TO POSSIBLE PUBLIC POLICIES COVERING

ENERGY-RELATED GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS IN ITS LONG-TERM ENERGY OUTLOOK, WHICH

IS USED FOR ASSESSING THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT AND IN ITS INVESTMENT

EVALUATIONS.

THE INFORMATION PROVIDED IN THE LONG-TERM BUSINESS OUTLOOK INCLUDES

EXXONMOBIL’S INTERNAL ESTIMATES AND FORECASTS BASED UPON INTERNAL DATA AND

ANALYSES AS WELL AS PUBLICLY AVAILABLE INFORMATION FROM EXTERNAL SOURCES

INCLUDING THE INTERNATIONAL ENERGY AGENCY.

UPSTREAM

EXXONMOBIL

CONTINUES TO MAINTAIN A DIVERSE PORTFOLIO OF EXPLORATION AND DEVELOPMENT

OPPORTUNITIES, WHICH ENABLES THE CORPORATION TO BE SELECTIVE, MAXIMIZING

SHAREHOLDER VALUE AND MITIGATING POLITICAL AND TECHNICAL RISKS. EXXONMOBIL’S

FUNDAMENTAL UPSTREAM BUSINESS STRATEGIES GUIDE OUR GLOBAL EXPLORATION,

DEVELOPMENT, PRODUCTION, AND GAS AND POWER MARKETING ACTIVITIES. THESE STRATEGIES

INCLUDE IDENTIFYING AND SELECTIVELY CAPTURING THE HIGHEST QUALITY

OPPORTUNITIES, EXERCISING A DISCIPLINED APPROACH TO INVESTING AND COST

MANAGEMENT, DEVELOPING AND APPLYING HIGH-IMPACT TECHNOLOGIES, MAXIMIZING THE

PROFITABILITY OF EXISTING OIL AND GAS PRODUCTION, AND CAPITALIZING ON GROWING

NATURAL GAS AND POWER MARKETS.   THESE STRATEGIES ARE UNDERPINNED BY A

RELENTLESS FOCUS ON OPERATIONAL EXCELLENCE, COMMITMENT TO INNOVATIVE

TECHNOLOGIES, DEVELOPMENT OF OUR EMPLOYEES, AND INVESTMENT IN THE COMMUNITIES

WITHIN WHICH WE OPERATE.

AS FUTURE DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS AND DRILLING ACTIVITIES BRING NEW

PRODUCTION ONLINE, THE CORPORATION EXPECTS A SHIFT IN THE GEOGRAPHIC MIX OF ITS

PRODUCTION VOLUMES BETWEEN NOW AND 2017. OIL AND NATURAL GAS OUTPUT FROM NORTH

AMERICA IS EXPECTED TO INCREASE OVER THE NEXT FIVE YEARS BASED ON CURRENT

CAPITAL ACTIVITY PLANS. CURRENTLY, THIS GROWTH AREA ACCOUNTS FOR 32 PERCENT OF

THE CORPORATION’S PRODUCTION. BY 2017, IT IS EXPECTED TO GENERATE ABOUT 35

PERCENT OF TOTAL VOLUMES. THE REMAINDER OF THE CORPORATION’S PRODUCTION IS

EXPECTED TO INCLUDE CONTRIBUTIONS FROM BOTH ESTABLISHED OPERATIONS AND NEW

PROJECTS AROUND THE GLOBE.

42

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL

CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

IN ADDITION TO AN EVOLVING GEOGRAPHIC MIX, WE EXPECT

THERE WILL ALSO BE CONTINUED CHANGE IN THE TYPE OF OPPORTUNITIES FROM WHICH

VOLUMES ARE PRODUCED. PRODUCTION FROM DIVERSE RESOURCE TYPES UTILIZING

SPECIALIZED TECHNOLOGIES SUCH AS ARCTIC TECHNOLOGY, DEEPWATER DRILLING AND

PRODUCTION SYSTEMS, HEAVY OIL AND OIL SANDS RECOVERY PROCESSES, UNCONVENTIONAL

GAS AND OIL PRODUCTION AND LNG IS EXPECTED TO GROW FROM ABOUT 45 PERCENT TO

AROUND 55 PERCENT OF THE CORPORATION’S OUTPUT BETWEEN NOW AND 2017. WE DO NOT

ANTICIPATE THAT THE EXPECTED CHANGE IN THE GEOGRAPHIC MIX OF PRODUCTION

VOLUMES, AND IN THE TYPES OF OPPORTUNITIES FROM WHICH VOLUMES WILL BE PRODUCED,

WILL HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE NATURE AND THE EXTENT OF THE RISKS DISCLOSED

IN ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS, OR RESULT IN A MATERIAL CHANGE IN OUR LEVEL OF UNIT

OPERATING EXPENSES. THE CORPORATION’S OVERALL VOLUME CAPACITY OUTLOOK, BASED ON

PROJECTS COMING ONSTREAM AS ANTICIPATED, IS FOR PRODUCTION CAPACITY TO GROW

OVER THE PERIOD 2013-2017. HOWEVER, ACTUAL VOLUMES WILL VARY FROM YEAR TO YEAR

DUE TO THE TIMING OF INDIVIDUAL PROJECT START-UPS AND OTHER CAPITAL ACTIVITIES,

OPERATIONAL OUTAGES, RESERVOIR PERFORMANCE, PERFORMANCE OF ENHANCED OIL

RECOVERY PROJECTS, REGULATORY CHANGES, ASSET SALES, WEATHER EVENTS, PRICE

EFFECTS UNDER PRODUCTION SHARING CONTRACTS AND OTHER FACTORS DESCRIBED IN ITEM

1A. RISK FACTORS. ENHANCED OIL RECOVERY PROJECTS EXTRACT HYDROCARBONS FROM

RESERVOIRS IN EXCESS OF THAT WHICH MAY BE PRODUCED THROUGH PRIMARY RECOVERY,

I.E., THROUGH PRESSURE DEPLETION OR NATURAL AQUIFER SUPPORT. THEY INCLUDE THE

INJECTION OF WATER, GASES OR CHEMICALS INTO A RESERVOIR TO PRODUCE HYDROCARBONS

OTHERWISE UNOBTAINABLE.

DOWNSTREAM

EXXONMOBIL’S

DOWNSTREAM IS A LARGE, DIVERSIFIED BUSINESS WITH REFINING, LOGISTICS, AND

MARKETING COMPLEXES AROUND THE WORLD. THE CORPORATION HAS A PRESENCE IN MATURE

MARKETS IN NORTH AMERICA AND EUROPE, AS WELL AS IN THE GROWING ASIA PACIFIC

REGION. EXXONMOBIL’S FUNDAMENTAL DOWNSTREAM BUSINESS STRATEGIES POSITION THE

COMPANY TO DELIVER LONG-TERM GROWTH IN SHAREHOLDER VALUE THAT IS SUPERIOR TO

COMPETITION ACROSS A RANGE OF MARKET CONDITIONS. THESE STRATEGIES INCLUDE

MAINTAINING BEST-IN-CLASS OPERATIONS IN ALL ASPECTS OF THE BUSINESS, MAXIMIZING

VALUE FROM LEADING-EDGE TECHNOLOGIES, CAPITALIZING ON INTEGRATION ACROSS

EXXONMOBIL BUSINESSES, SELECTIVELY INVESTING FOR RESILIENT, ADVANTAGED RETURNS,

LEADING THE INDUSTRY IN EFFICIENCY AND EFFECTIVENESS, AND PROVIDING QUALITY,

VALUED PRODUCTS AND SERVICES TO CUSTOMERS.

EXXONMOBIL HAS AN OWNERSHIP INTEREST IN 32 REFINERIES, LOCATED IN 17

COUNTRIES, WITH DISTILLATION CAPACITY OF 5.4 MILLION BARRELS PER DAY AND

LUBRICANT BASESTOCK MANUFACTURING CAPACITY OF 126 THOUSAND BARRELS PER DAY.

EXXONMOBIL’S FUELS AND LUBES MARKETING BUSINESSES HAVE SIGNIFICANT GLOBAL

REACH, WITH MULTIPLE CHANNELS TO MARKET SERVING A DIVERSE CUSTOMER BASE.  OUR

PORTFOLIO OF WORLD-RENOWNED BRANDS INCLUDES EXXON, MOBIL, ESSO, AND MOBIL 1.

THE DOWNSTREAM INDUSTRY ENVIRONMENT REMAINS CHALLENGING.  DEMAND

WEAKNESS AND OVERCAPACITY IN THE REFINING SECTOR WILL CONTINUE TO PUT PRESSURE

ON MARGINS.  IN THE NEAR TERM, WE SEE VARIABILITY IN REFINING MARGINS, WITH

SOME REGIONS SEEING STRONGER MARGINS AS REFINERIES RATIONALIZE. IN MARKETS LIKE

NORTH AMERICA, LOWER RAW MATERIAL AND ENERGY COSTS DRIVEN BY THE INCREASING

CRUDE AND NATURAL GAS PRODUCTION STRENGTHENED REFINING MARGINS IN SEVERAL

AREAS.

REFINING MARGINS ARE LARGELY DRIVEN BY DIFFERENCES IN COMMODITY PRICES

AND ARE A FUNCTION OF THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WHAT A REFINERY PAYS FOR ITS RAW

MATERIALS (PRIMARILY CRUDE OIL) AND THE MARKET PRICES FOR THE RANGE OF PRODUCTS

PRODUCED (PRIMARILY GASOLINE, HEATING OIL, DIESEL OIL, JET FUEL AND FUEL OIL).

CRUDE OIL AND MANY PRODUCTS ARE WIDELY TRADED WITH PUBLISHED PRICES, INCLUDING

THOSE QUOTED ON MULTIPLE EXCHANGES AROUND THE WORLD (E.G., NEW YORK MERCANTILE

EXCHANGE AND INTERCONTINENTAL EXCHANGE). PRICES FOR THESE COMMODITIES ARE

DETERMINED BY THE GLOBAL MARKETPLACE AND ARE INFLUENCED BY MANY FACTORS,

INCLUDING GLOBAL AND REGIONAL SUPPLY/DEMAND BALANCES, INVENTORY LEVELS,

REFINERY OPERATIONS, IMPORT/EXPORT BALANCES, CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS, SEASONAL DEMAND,

WEATHER AND POLITICAL CLIMATE.

EXXONMOBIL’S LONG-TERM OUTLOOK IS THAT REFINING MARGINS WILL REMAIN

WEAK AS COMPETITION IN THE INDUSTRY REMAINS INTENSE AND, IN THE NEAR TERM, NEW

CAPACITY ADDITIONS OUTPACE THE GROWTH IN GLOBAL DEMAND. ADDITIONALLY, AS DESCRIBED

IN MORE DETAIL IN ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS, PROPOSED CARBON POLICY AND OTHER

CLIMATE-RELATED REGULATIONS IN MANY COUNTRIES, AS WELL AS THE CONTINUED GROWTH

IN BIOFUELS MANDATES, COULD HAVE NEGATIVE IMPACTS ON THE REFINING BUSINESS.

IN THE RETAIL FUELS MARKETING BUSINESS, COMPETITION CONTINUES TO CAUSE

INFLATION-ADJUSTED MARGINS TO DECLINE. IN 2012, EXXONMOBIL PROGRESSED THE

TRANSITION OF THE DIRECT SERVED (I.E., DEALER, COMPANY-OPERATED) RETAIL NETWORK

IN THE U.S. TO A MORE CAPITAL-EFFICIENT BRANDED DISTRIBUTOR MODEL. THIS

TRANSITION WAS ANNOUNCED IN 2008 AND IS NEARING COMPLETION.

OUR LUBRICANTS BUSINESS CONTINUES TO GROW. EXXONMOBIL IS A MARKET

LEADER IN HIGH-VALUE SYNTHETIC LUBRICANTS, AND WE CONTINUE TO GROW OUR BUSINESS

IN KEY MARKETS SUCH AS CHINA, INDIA AND RUSSIA AT RATES CONSIDERABLY FASTER

THAN INDUSTRY.

THE DOWNSTREAM PORTFOLIO IS CONTINUALLY EVALUATED DURING ALL PARTS OF

THE BUSINESS CYCLE, AND NUMEROUS ASSET DIVESTMENTS HAVE BEEN MADE OVER THE PAST

DECADE. IN 2012, WE DIVESTED OUR DOWNSTREAM BUSINESSES IN ARGENTINA, URUGUAY,

PARAGUAY, CENTRAL AMERICA, MALAYSIA, AND SWITZERLAND. WE ALSO RESTRUCTURED AND

REDUCED OUR HOLDINGS IN JAPAN. WHEN INVESTING IN THE DOWNSTREAM, EXXONMOBIL

REMAINS FOCUSED ON SELECTIVE AND RESILIENT PROJECTS. THESE INVESTMENTS

CAPITALIZE ON THE CORPORATION’S WORLD-CLASS SCALE AND INTEGRATION, INDUSTRY

LEADING EFFICIENCY, LEADING-EDGE TECHNOLOGY AND RESPECTED BRANDS, ENABLING

EXXONMOBIL TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF ATTRACTIVE EMERGING GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES AROUND

THE GLOBE. IN 2012, THE COMPANY COMPLETED THE HYDROFINER CONVERSION PROJECT AT

THE FAWLEY, UNITED KINGDOM, REFINERY TO PRODUCE HIGHER-VALUE ULTRA-LOW SULFUR

DIESEL.

AT THE JURONG/PAC REFINERY IN SINGAPORE, CONSTRUCTION

ACTIVITIES TO BUILD A NEW DIESEL HYDROTREATER ARE EXPECTED TO COMPLETE IN 2013,

ADDING CAPACITY OF MORE THAN 2 MILLION GALLONS PER DAY OF ULTRA-LOW SULFUR

DIESEL TO MEET INCREASING DEMAND IN THE ASIA PACIFIC REGION. ADDITIONALLY,

CONSTRUCTION OF A LOWER SULFUR FUELS PROJECT AT THE JOINT SAUDI ARAMCO AND EXXONMOBIL

SAMREF REFINERY IN YANBU, SAUDI ARABIA IS ALSO UNDERWAY. THE PROJECT WILL

INCLUDE NEW GASOLINE AND EXPANDED DIESEL HYDROTREATING AND SULFUR RECOVERY

EQUIPMENT, AND COMPLETION IS EXPECTED BY THE END OF 2013. WE ARE ALSO EXPANDING

OUR SINGAPORE AND CHINA LUBE OIL BLENDING PLANTS TO SUPPORT FUTURE DEMAND

GROWTH IN THESE EMERGING MARKETS.

CHEMICAL

WORLDWIDE

PETROCHEMICAL DEMAND GREW MODESTLY IN 2012 WITH SUBSTANTIAL VARIATIONS IN

REGIONAL PERFORMANCE.  IN NORTH AMERICA, UNCONVENTIONAL NATURAL GAS CONTINUED

TO PROVIDE ADVANTAGED ETHANE FEEDSTOCK AND LOW COST ENERGY FOR STEAM CRACKERS

AND A FAVORABLE MARGIN ENVIRONMENT FOR INTEGRATED CHEMICAL PRODUCERS.  MARGINS

IN ASIA REMAINED LOW, WITH EXCESS ETHYLENE SUPPLY.  MARGINS AND VOLUMES

DECLINED IN EUROPE WITH THE WEAKER ECONOMY.  SPECIALTY PRODUCTS OVERALL

REPORTED FIRM GLOBAL DEMAND AND MARGINS.

EXXONMOBIL BENEFITED FROM CONTINUED OPERATIONAL EXCELLENCE AND A

BALANCED PORTFOLIO OF PRODUCTS. IN ADDITION TO BEING A WORLDWIDE SUPPLIER OF

COMMODITY PETROCHEMICAL PRODUCTS, EXXONMOBIL CHEMICAL ALSO HAS A NUMBER OF

LESS-CYCLICAL SPECIALTIES BUSINESS LINES, WHICH DELIVERED STRONG RESULTS IN

2012. CHEMICAL’S COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGES ARE DUE TO ITS BUSINESS MIX, BROAD

GEOGRAPHIC COVERAGE, INVESTMENT AND COST DISCIPLINE, INTEGRATION WITH

REFINERIES OR UPSTREAM GAS PROCESSING FACILITIES, SUPERIOR FEEDSTOCK

MANAGEMENT, LEADING PROPRIETARY TECHNOLOGY AND PRODUCT APPLICATION EXPERTISE.

IN 2012 EXXONMOBIL COMPLETED CONSTRUCTION OF THE SINGAPORE

PETROCHEMICAL EXPANSION PROJECT AND COMMENCED START-UP OPERATIONS AT ONE OF THE

WORLD’S LARGEST ETHYLENE STEAM CRACKERS, THE CENTERPIECE OF THE COMPANY’S

MULTI-BILLION DOLLAR EXPANSION AT THE COMPLEX.  POWERED BY A NEW 220-MEGAWATT

COGENERATION PLANT, THE EXPANSION ADDS 2.6 MILLION TONNES PER YEAR OF NEW

FINISHED PRODUCT CAPACITY.

AND A NET DEBT INCREASE IN CONTRAST WITH PRIOR YEAR DEBT REPURCHASES WERE

PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A HIGHER LEVEL OF PURCHASES OF EXXONMOBIL SHARES AND A

HIGHER LEVEL OF CAPITAL SPENDING. INCLUDED IN TOTAL CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS

AT YEAR-END 2011 WAS $0.4 BILLION OF RESTRICTED CASH. FOR ADDITIONAL DETAILS,

SEE THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS.

ALTHOUGH THE CORPORATION HAS ACCESS TO SIGNIFICANT CAPACITY OF

LONG-TERM AND SHORT-TERM LIQUIDITY, INTERNALLY GENERATED FUNDS COVER THE

MAJORITY OF ITS FINANCIAL REQUIREMENTS. CASH THAT MAY BE TEMPORARILY AVAILABLE

AS SURPLUS TO THE CORPORATION’S IMMEDIATE NEEDS IS CAREFULLY MANAGED THROUGH

COUNTERPARTY QUALITY AND INVESTMENT GUIDELINES TO ENSURE IT IS SECURE AND

READILY AVAILABLE TO MEET THE CORPORATION’S CASH REQUIREMENTS AND TO OPTIMIZE

RETURNS.

TO SUPPORT CASH FLOWS IN FUTURE PERIODS THE CORPORATION WILL NEED TO

CONTINUALLY FIND AND DEVELOP NEW FIELDS, AND CONTINUE TO DEVELOP AND APPLY NEW

TECHNOLOGIES AND RECOVERY PROCESSES TO EXISTING FIELDS, IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN OR

INCREASE PRODUCTION. AFTER A PERIOD OF PRODUCTION AT PLATEAU RATES, IT IS THE

NATURE OF OIL AND GAS FIELDS EVENTUALLY TO PRODUCE AT DECLINING RATES FOR THE

REMAINDER OF THEIR ECONOMIC LIFE. AVERAGED OVER ALL THE CORPORATION’S EXISTING

OIL AND GAS FIELDS AND WITHOUT NEW PROJECTS, EXXONMOBIL’S PRODUCTION IS

EXPECTED TO DECLINE AT AN AVERAGE OF APPROXIMATELY 3 PERCENT PER YEAR OVER THE

NEXT FEW YEARS. DECLINE RATES CAN VARY WIDELY BY INDIVIDUAL FIELD DUE TO A

NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE TYPE OF RESERVOIR, FLUID

PROPERTIES, RECOVERY MECHANISMS, WORK ACTIVITY, AND AGE OF THE FIELD.

FURTHERMORE, THE CORPORATION’S NET INTEREST IN PRODUCTION FOR INDIVIDUAL FIELDS

CAN VARY WITH PRICE AND CONTRACTUAL TERMS.

THE CORPORATION HAS LONG BEEN SUCCESSFUL AT OFFSETTING THE EFFECTS OF

NATURAL FIELD DECLINE THROUGH DISCIPLINED INVESTMENTS IN QUALITY OPPORTUNITIES

AND PROJECT EXECUTION. OVER THE LAST DECADE, THIS HAS RESULTED IN NET ANNUAL

ADDITIONS TO PROVED RESERVES THAT HAVE EXCEEDED THE AMOUNT PRODUCED. PROJECTS

ARE IN PROGRESS OR PLANNED TO INCREASE PRODUCTION CAPACITY. HOWEVER, THESE

VOLUME INCREASES ARE SUBJECT TO A VARIETY OF RISKS INCLUDING PROJECT START-UP

TIMING, OPERATIONAL OUTAGES, RESERVOIR PERFORMANCE, CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS

PRICES, WEATHER EVENTS, AND REGULATORY CHANGES. THE CORPORATION’S CASH FLOWS

ARE ALSO HIGHLY DEPENDENT ON CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS PRICES. PLEASE REFER TO

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS FOR A MORE COMPLETE DISCUSSION OF RISKS.

THE CORPORATION’S FINANCIAL STRENGTH ENABLES IT TO MAKE LARGE,

LONG-TERM CAPITAL EXPENDITURES. CAPITAL AND EXPLORATION EXPENDITURES IN 2012

WERE $39.8 BILLION, REFLECTING THE CORPORATION’S CONTINUED ACTIVE INVESTMENT

PROGRAM. THE CORPORATION ANTICIPATES AN INVESTMENT PROFILE OF ABOUT $38 BILLION

PER YEAR FOR THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS. ACTUAL SPENDING COULD VARY DEPENDING ON

THE PROGRESS OF INDIVIDUAL PROJECTS AND PROPERTY ACQUISITIONS.  THE CORPORATION

HAS A LARGE AND DIVERSE PORTFOLIO OF DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS AND EXPLORATION

OPPORTUNITIES, WHICH HELPS MITIGATE THE OVERALL POLITICAL AND TECHNICAL RISKS

OF THE CORPORATION’S UPSTREAM SEGMENT AND ASSOCIATED CASH FLOW. FURTHER, DUE TO

ITS FINANCIAL STRENGTH, DEBT CAPACITY AND DIVERSE PORTFOLIO OF OPPORTUNITIES,

THE RISK ASSOCIATED WITH FAILURE OR DELAY OF ANY SINGLE PROJECT WOULD NOT HAVE

A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE CORPORATION’S LIQUIDITY OR ABILITY TO GENERATE

SUFFICIENT CASH FLOWS FOR OPERATIONS AND ITS FIXED COMMITMENTS. THE PURCHASE

AND SALE OF OIL AND GAS PROPERTIES HAVE NOT HAD A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE

AMOUNT OR TIMING OF CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES.

THIS TABLE

EXCLUDES COMMODITY PURCHASE OBLIGATIONS (VOLUMETRIC COMMITMENTS BUT NO FIXED OR

MINIMUM PRICE) WHICH ARE RESOLD SHORTLY AFTER PURCHASE, EITHER IN AN ACTIVE,

HIGHLY LIQUID MARKET OR UNDER LONG-TERM, UNCONDITIONAL SALES CONTRACTS WITH

SIMILAR PRICING TERMS. EXAMPLES INCLUDE LONG-TERM, NONCANCELABLE LNG AND

NATURAL GAS PURCHASE COMMITMENTS AND COMMITMENTS TO PURCHASE REFINERY PRODUCTS

AT MARKET PRICES. INCLUSION OF SUCH COMMITMENTS WOULD NOT BE MEANINGFUL IN

ASSESSING LIQUIDITY AND CASH FLOW, BECAUSE THESE PURCHASES WILL BE OFFSET IN

THE SAME PERIODS BY CASH RECEIVED FROM THE RELATED SALES TRANSACTIONS. THE

TABLE ALSO EXCLUDES UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS TOTALING $7.7 BILLION AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2012, BECAUSE THE CORPORATION IS UNABLE TO MAKE REASONABLY

RELIABLE ESTIMATES OF THE TIMING OF CASH SETTLEMENTS WITH THE RESPECTIVE TAXING

AUTHORITIES. FURTHER DETAILS ON THE UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS CAN BE FOUND IN

NOTE 19, INCOME, SALES-BASED AND OTHER TAXES.

NOTES.

(1)   INCLUDES CAPITALIZED LEASE

OBLIGATIONS OF $431 MILLION.

(2)   THE AMOUNT DUE IN ONE YEAR IS

INCLUDED IN NOTES AND LOANS PAYABLE OF $3,653 MILLION.

(3)   THE FAIR VALUE OF ASSET

RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS, PRIMARILY UPSTREAM ASSET REMOVAL COSTS AT THE

COMPLETION OF FIELD LIFE.

(4)   THE AMOUNT BY WHICH THE

BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS EXCEEDED THE FAIR VALUE OF FUND ASSETS FOR CERTAIN U.S. AND

NON-U.S. PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT PLANS AT YEAR END. THE PAYMENTS BY

PERIOD INCLUDE EXPECTED CONTRIBUTIONS TO FUNDED PENSION PLANS IN 2013 AND

ESTIMATED BENEFIT PAYMENTS FOR UNFUNDED PLANS IN ALL YEARS.

(5)   MINIMUM COMMITMENTS FOR

OPERATING LEASES, SHOWN ON AN UNDISCOUNTED BASIS, COVER DRILLING EQUIPMENT,

TANKERS, SERVICE STATIONS AND OTHER PROPERTIES.

(6)   UNCONDITIONAL PURCHASE

OBLIGATIONS (UPOS) ARE THOSE LONG-TERM COMMITMENTS THAT ARE NONCANCELABLE OR

CANCELABLE ONLY UNDER CERTAIN CONDITIONS, AND THAT THIRD PARTIES HAVE USED TO

SECURE FINANCING FOR THE FACILITIES THAT WILL PROVIDE THE CONTRACTED GOODS OR

SERVICES. THE UNDISCOUNTED OBLIGATIONS OF $1,127 MILLION MAINLY PERTAIN TO

PIPELINE THROUGHPUT AGREEMENTS AND INCLUDE $584 MILLION OF OBLIGATIONS TO

EQUITY COMPANIES.

(7)   TAKE-OR-PAY OBLIGATIONS ARE

NONCANCELABLE, LONG-TERM COMMITMENTS FOR GOODS AND SERVICES OTHER THAN UPOS.

THE UNDISCOUNTED OBLIGATIONS OF $26,209 MILLION MAINLY PERTAIN TO MANUFACTURING

SUPPLY, PIPELINE AND TERMINALING AGREEMENTS AND INCLUDE $187 MILLION OF

OBLIGATIONS TO EQUITY COMPANIES.

(8)   FIRM COMMITMENTS RELATED TO

CAPITAL PROJECTS, SHOWN ON AN UNDISCOUNTED BASIS, TOTALED APPROXIMATELY $32.5

BILLION. THESE COMMITMENTS WERE PRIMARILY ASSOCIATED WITH UPSTREAM PROJECTS

OUTSIDE THE U.S., OF WHICH $18.4 BILLION WAS ASSOCIATED WITH PROJECTS IN CANADA,

AUSTRALIA, AFRICA AND MALAYSIA.  THE CORPORATION EXPECTS TO FUND THE MAJORITY

OF THESE PROJECTS THROUGH INTERNAL CASH FLOW.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL

CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

GUARANTEES

THE

CORPORATION AND CERTAIN OF ITS CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES WERE CONTINGENTLY

LIABLE AT DECEMBER 31, 2012, FOR GUARANTEES RELATING TO NOTES, LOANS AND

PERFORMANCE UNDER CONTRACTS (NOTE 16). WHERE GUARANTEES FOR ENVIRONMENTAL

REMEDIATION AND OTHER SIMILAR MATTERS DO NOT INCLUDE A STATED CAP, THE AMOUNTS

REFLECT MANAGEMENT’S ESTIMATE OF THE MAXIMUM POTENTIAL EXPOSURE. THESE GUARANTEES

ARE NOT REASONABLY LIKELY TO HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE CORPORATION’S FINANCIAL

CONDITION, CHANGES IN FINANCIAL CONDITION, REVENUES OR EXPENSES, RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS, LIQUIDITY, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES OR CAPITAL RESOURCES.

VIEWS THE CORPORATION’S FINANCIAL STRENGTH, AS EVIDENCED BY THE ABOVE FINANCIAL

RATIOS AND OTHER SIMILAR MEASURES, TO BE A COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE OF STRATEGIC

IMPORTANCE. THE CORPORATION’S SOUND FINANCIAL POSITION GIVES IT THE OPPORTUNITY

TO ACCESS THE WORLD’S CAPITAL MARKETS IN THE FULL RANGE OF MARKET CONDITIONS,

AND ENABLES THE CORPORATION TO TAKE ON LARGE, LONG-TERM CAPITAL COMMITMENTS IN

THE PURSUIT OF MAXIMIZING SHAREHOLDER VALUE.

LITIGATION AND OTHER CONTINGENCIES

AS DISCUSSED

IN NOTE 16, A VARIETY OF CLAIMS HAVE BEEN MADE AGAINST EXXONMOBIL AND CERTAIN

OF ITS CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES IN A NUMBER OF PENDING LAWSUITS. BASED ON A

CONSIDERATION OF ALL RELEVANT FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES, THE CORPORATION DOES NOT

BELIEVE THE ULTIMATE OUTCOME OF ANY CURRENTLY PENDING LAWSUIT AGAINST

EXXONMOBIL WILL HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT UPON THE CORPORATION’S

OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, OR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS TAKEN AS A WHOLE.

THERE ARE NO EVENTS OR UNCERTAINTIES BEYOND THOSE ALREADY INCLUDED IN REPORTED

FINANCIAL INFORMATION THAT WOULD INDICATE A MATERIAL CHANGE IN FUTURE OPERATING

RESULTS OR FINANCIAL CONDITION. REFER TO NOTE 16 FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON

CAPITAL AND

EXPLORATION EXPENDITURES IN 2012 WERE $39.8 BILLION, AS THE CORPORATION

CONTINUED TO PURSUE OPPORTUNITIES TO FIND AND PRODUCE NEW SUPPLIES OF OIL AND

NATURAL GAS TO MEET GLOBAL DEMAND FOR ENERGY. THE CORPORATION ANTICIPATES AN

INVESTMENT PROFILE OF ABOUT $38 BILLION PER YEAR FOR THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS.

ACTUAL SPENDING COULD VARY DEPENDING ON THE PROGRESS OF INDIVIDUAL PROJECTS AND

PROPERTY ACQUISITIONS.

UPSTREAM SPENDING OF $36.1 BILLION IN 2012 WAS UP 9 PERCENT FROM 2011,

REFLECTING INVESTMENTS IN THE GULF OF MEXICO AND CONTINUED PROGRESS ON

WORLD-CLASS PROJECTS IN CANADA, AUSTRALIA AND PAPUA NEW GUINEA. PROPERTY

ACQUISITION COSTS IN 2012 WERE COMPARABLE TO 2011. THE MAJORITY OF EXPENDITURES

ARE ON DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS, WHICH TYPICALLY TAKE TWO TO FOUR YEARS FROM THE

TIME OF RECORDING PROVED UNDEVELOPED RESERVES TO THE START OF PRODUCTION FROM

THOSE RESERVES. THE PERCENTAGE OF PROVED DEVELOPED RESERVES WAS 61 PERCENT OF

TOTAL PROVED RESERVES AT YEAR-END 2012, AND HAS BEEN OVER 60 PERCENT FOR THE

LAST FIVE YEARS, INDICATING THAT PROVED RESERVES ARE CONSISTENTLY MOVED FROM

UNDEVELOPED TO DEVELOPED STATUS. CAPITAL INVESTMENTS IN THE DOWNSTREAM TOTALED

$2.3 BILLION IN 2012, AN INCREASE OF $0.1 BILLION FROM 2011, MAINLY REFLECTING

HIGHER ENVIRONMENTAL AND ENERGY-RELATED REFINING PROJECT SPENDING. THE CHEMICAL

CAPITAL EXPENDITURES OF $1.4 BILLION WERE THE SAME LEVEL AS IN 2011 WITH HIGHER

INVESTMENTS IN THE U.S., SAUDI ARABIA AND CHINA OFFSETTING REDUCED SPENDING ON

THE SINGAPORE EXPANSION AS IT APPROACHES FULL START-UP.

HIGHER EARNINGS OFFSET BY THE LOWER EFFECTIVE TAX RATE.  THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE

WAS 44 PERCENT COMPARED TO 46 PERCENT IN THE PRIOR YEAR DUE TO A LOWER

EFFECTIVE TAX RATE ON DIVESTMENTS.  SALES-BASED AND ALL OTHER TAXES AND DUTIES

BILLION HIGHER THAN 2010, REFLECTING HIGHER PRE-TAX INCOME IN 2011. A HIGHER

SHARE OF PRE-TAX INCOME FROM THE UPSTREAM SEGMENT IN 2011 INCREASED THE

EFFECTIVE TAX RATE TO 46 PERCENT COMPARED TO 45 PERCENT IN 2010. SALES-BASED

AND ALL OTHER TAXES AND DUTIES OF $77.0 BILLION IN 2011 INCREASED $9.4 BILLION,

THROUGHOUT

EXXONMOBIL’S BUSINESSES, NEW AND ONGOING MEASURES ARE TAKEN TO PREVENT AND

MINIMIZE THE IMPACT OF OUR OPERATIONS ON AIR, WATER AND GROUND. THESE

INCLUDE A SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT IN REFINING INFRASTRUCTURE AND TECHNOLOGY TO

MANUFACTURE CLEAN FUELS AS WELL AS PROJECTS TO MONITOR AND REDUCE NITROGEN

OXIDE, SULFUR OXIDE AND GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS AND EXPENDITURES FOR ASSET

RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS. USING DEFINITIONS AND GUIDELINES ESTABLISHED BY THE AMERICAN

PETROLEUM INSTITUTE, EXXONMOBIL’S 2012 WORLDWIDE ENVIRONMENTAL EXPENDITURES FOR

ALL SUCH PREVENTATIVE AND REMEDIATION STEPS, INCLUDING EXXONMOBIL’S SHARE OF

EQUITY COMPANY EXPENDITURES, WERE ABOUT $5.5 BILLION. THE TOTAL COST FOR

SUCH ACTIVITIES IS EXPECTED TO HAVE A MODEST INCREASE IN 2013 AND 2014 (WITH

CAPITAL EXPENDITURES APPROXIMATELY 45 PERCENT OF THE TOTAL).

ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES

THE

CORPORATION ACCRUES ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES WHEN IT IS PROBABLE THAT

OBLIGATIONS HAVE BEEN INCURRED AND THE AMOUNTS CAN BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED.

THIS POLICY APPLIES TO ASSETS OR BUSINESSES CURRENTLY OWNED OR PREVIOUSLY

DISPOSED. EXXONMOBIL HAS ACCRUED LIABILITIES FOR PROBABLE ENVIRONMENTAL

REMEDIATION OBLIGATIONS AT VARIOUS SITES, INCLUDING MULTIPARTY SITES WHERE THE

U.S. ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY HAS IDENTIFIED EXXONMOBIL AS ONE OF THE

POTENTIALLY RESPONSIBLE PARTIES. THE INVOLVEMENT OF OTHER FINANCIALLY

RESPONSIBLE COMPANIES AT THESE MULTIPARTY SITES COULD MITIGATE EXXONMOBIL’S

ACTUAL JOINT AND SEVERAL LIABILITY EXPOSURE. AT PRESENT, NO INDIVIDUAL SITE IS

EXPECTED TO HAVE LOSSES MATERIAL TO EXXONMOBIL’S OPERATIONS OR FINANCIAL CONDITION.

CONSOLIDATED COMPANY PROVISIONS MADE IN 2012 FOR ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES WERE

$391 MILLION ($420 MILLION IN 2011) AND THE BALANCE SHEET REFLECTS ACCUMULATED

LIABILITIES OF $841 MILLION AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2012, AND $886 MILLION AS

OF DECEMBER 31, 2011.

CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES.

CRUDE OIL,

NATURAL GAS, PETROLEUM PRODUCT AND CHEMICAL PRICES HAVE FLUCTUATED IN RESPONSE

TO CHANGING MARKET FORCES. THE IMPACTS OF THESE PRICE FLUCTUATIONS ON EARNINGS

FROM UPSTREAM, DOWNSTREAM AND CHEMICAL OPERATIONS HAVE VARIED. IN THE UPSTREAM,

A $1 PER BARREL CHANGE IN THE WEIGHTED-AVERAGE REALIZED PRICE OF OIL

WOULD HAVE APPROXIMATELY A $350 MILLION ANNUAL AFTER-TAX EFFECT ON UPSTREAM

CONSOLIDATED PLUS EQUITY COMPANY EARNINGS. SIMILARLY, A $0.10 PER KCF CHANGE IN

THE WORLDWIDE AVERAGE GAS REALIZATION WOULD HAVE APPROXIMATELY A $200 MILLION

ANNUAL AFTER-TAX EFFECT ON UPSTREAM CONSOLIDATED PLUS EQUITY COMPANY EARNINGS.

FOR ANY GIVEN PERIOD, THE EXTENT OF ACTUAL BENEFIT OR DETRIMENT WILL BE

DEPENDENT ON THE PRICE MOVEMENTS OF INDIVIDUAL TYPES OF CRUDE OIL, TAXES AND

OTHER GOVERNMENT TAKE IMPACTS, PRICE ADJUSTMENT LAGS IN LONG-TERM GAS

CONTRACTS, AND CRUDE AND GAS PRODUCTION VOLUMES. ACCORDINGLY, CHANGES IN

BENCHMARK PRICES FOR CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS ONLY PROVIDE BROAD INDICATORS OF

CHANGES IN THE EARNINGS EXPERIENCED IN ANY PARTICULAR PERIOD.

IN THE VERY COMPETITIVE DOWNSTREAM AND CHEMICAL ENVIRONMENTS, EARNINGS

ARE PRIMARILY DETERMINED BY MARGIN CAPTURE RATHER THAN ABSOLUTE PRICE LEVELS OF

PRODUCTS SOLD. REFINING MARGINS ARE A FUNCTION OF THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WHAT A

REFINER PAYS FOR ITS RAW MATERIALS (PRIMARILY CRUDE OIL) AND THE MARKET PRICES

FOR THE RANGE OF PRODUCTS PRODUCED. THESE PRICES IN TURN DEPEND ON GLOBAL AND

REGIONAL SUPPLY/DEMAND BALANCES, INVENTORY LEVELS, REFINERY OPERATIONS,

IMPORT/EXPORT BALANCES AND WEATHER.

THE GLOBAL ENERGY MARKETS CAN GIVE RISE TO EXTENDED PERIODS IN WHICH

MARKET CONDITIONS ARE ADVERSE TO ONE OR MORE OF THE CORPORATION’S BUSINESSES.

SUCH CONDITIONS, ALONG WITH THE CAPITAL-INTENSIVE NATURE OF THE INDUSTRY AND

VERY LONG LEAD TIMES ASSOCIATED WITH MANY OF OUR PROJECTS, UNDERSCORE THE

IMPORTANCE OF MAINTAINING A STRONG FINANCIAL POSITION. MANAGEMENT VIEWS THE

CORPORATION’S FINANCIAL STRENGTH AS A COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE.

53

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL

CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

IN GENERAL, SEGMENT RESULTS ARE NOT DEPENDENT ON THE

ABILITY TO SELL AND/OR PURCHASE PRODUCTS TO/FROM OTHER SEGMENTS. INSTEAD, WHERE

SUCH SALES TAKE PLACE, THEY ARE THE RESULT OF EFFICIENCIES AND COMPETITIVE

ADVANTAGES OF INTEGRATED REFINERY/CHEMICAL COMPLEXES. ADDITIONALLY,

INTERSEGMENT SALES ARE AT MARKET-BASED PRICES. THE PRODUCTS BOUGHT AND SOLD

BETWEEN SEGMENTS CAN ALSO BE ACQUIRED IN WORLDWIDE MARKETS THAT HAVE

SUBSTANTIAL LIQUIDITY, CAPACITY AND TRANSPORTATION CAPABILITIES. ABOUT 35

PERCENT OF THE CORPORATION’S INTERSEGMENT SALES ARE CRUDE OIL PRODUCED BY THE

UPSTREAM AND SOLD TO THE DOWNSTREAM. OTHER INTERSEGMENT SALES INCLUDE THOSE

BETWEEN REFINERIES AND CHEMICAL PLANTS RELATED TO RAW MATERIALS, FEEDSTOCKS AND

FINISHED PRODUCTS.

ALTHOUGH PRICE LEVELS OF CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS MAY RISE OR FALL

SIGNIFICANTLY OVER THE SHORT TO MEDIUM TERM DUE TO POLITICAL EVENTS, OPEC

ACTIONS AND OTHER FACTORS, INDUSTRY ECONOMICS OVER THE LONG TERM WILL CONTINUE

TO BE DRIVEN BY MARKET SUPPLY AND DEMAND. ACCORDINGLY, THE CORPORATION TESTS

THE VIABILITY OF ALL OF ITS INVESTMENTS OVER A BROAD RANGE OF FUTURE PRICES.

THE CORPORATION’S ASSESSMENT IS THAT ITS OPERATIONS WILL CONTINUE TO BE

SUCCESSFUL IN A VARIETY OF MARKET CONDITIONS. THIS IS THE OUTCOME OF

DISCIPLINED INVESTMENT AND ASSET MANAGEMENT PROGRAMS.

THE CORPORATION HAS AN ACTIVE ASSET MANAGEMENT PROGRAM IN WHICH

UNDERPERFORMING ASSETS ARE EITHER IMPROVED TO ACCEPTABLE LEVELS OR CONSIDERED

FOR DIVESTMENT. THE ASSET MANAGEMENT PROGRAM INCLUDES A DISCIPLINED, REGULAR

REVIEW TO ENSURE THAT ALL ASSETS ARE CONTRIBUTING TO THE CORPORATION’S

STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES. THE RESULT IS AN EFFICIENT CAPITAL BASE, AND THE

CORPORATION HAS SELDOM HAD TO WRITE DOWN THE CARRYING VALUE OF ASSETS, EVEN

DURING PERIODS OF LOW COMMODITY PRICES.

RISK MANAGEMENT

THE CORPORATION’S

SIZE, STRONG CAPITAL STRUCTURE, GEOGRAPHIC DIVERSITY AND THE COMPLEMENTARY

NATURE OF THE UPSTREAM, DOWNSTREAM AND CHEMICAL BUSINESSES REDUCE THE

CORPORATION’S ENTERPRISE-WIDE RISK FROM CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES, CURRENCY

RATES AND COMMODITY PRICES. AS A RESULT, THE CORPORATION MAKES LIMITED USE OF

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS TO MITIGATE THE IMPACT OF SUCH CHANGES. WITH RESPECT TO

DERIVATIVES ACTIVITIES, THE CORPORATION BELIEVES THAT THERE ARE NO MATERIAL

MARKET OR CREDIT RISKS TO THE CORPORATION’S FINANCIAL POSITION, RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS OR LIQUIDITY AS A RESULT OF THE DERIVATIVES DESCRIBED IN NOTE 13.

THE CORPORATION DOES NOT ENGAGE IN SPECULATIVE DERIVATIVE ACTIVITIES OR

DERIVATIVE TRADING ACTIVITIES NOR DOES IT USE DERIVATIVES WITH LEVERAGED

FEATURES. CREDIT RISK ASSOCIATED WITH THE CORPORATION’S DERIVATIVE POSITION IS

MITIGATED BY SEVERAL FACTORS, INCLUDING THE QUALITY OF AND FINANCIAL LIMITS

PLACED ON DERIVATIVE COUNTERPARTIES. THE CORPORATION MAINTAINS A SYSTEM OF

CONTROLS THAT INCLUDES THE AUTHORIZATION, REPORTING AND MONITORING OF

DERIVATIVE ACTIVITY.

THE CORPORATION IS EXPOSED TO CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES, PRIMARILY ON

ITS SHORT-TERM DEBT AND THE PORTION OF LONG-TERM DEBT THAT CARRIES FLOATING

INTEREST RATES. THE IMPACT OF A 100-BASIS-POINT CHANGE IN INTEREST RATES

AFFECTING THE CORPORATION’S DEBT WOULD NOT BE MATERIAL TO EARNINGS, CASH FLOW

OR FAIR VALUE. ALTHOUGH THE CORPORATION ISSUES LONG-TERM DEBT FROM TIME TO TIME

AND MAINTAINS A COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAM, INTERNALLY GENERATED FUNDS ARE EXPECTED

TO COVER THE MAJORITY OF ITS NET NEAR-TERM FINANCIAL REQUIREMENTS. HOWEVER,

SOME JOINT-VENTURE PARTNERS ARE DEPENDENT ON THE CREDIT MARKETS, AND THEIR

FUNDING ABILITY MAY IMPACT THE DEVELOPMENT PACE OF JOINT-VENTURE PROJECTS.

THE CORPORATION CONDUCTS BUSINESS IN MANY FOREIGN CURRENCIES AND IS

SUBJECT TO EXCHANGE RATE RISK ON CASH FLOWS RELATED TO SALES, EXPENSES,

FINANCING AND INVESTMENT TRANSACTIONS. THE IMPACTS OF FLUCTUATIONS IN EXCHANGE

RATES ON EXXONMOBIL’S GEOGRAPHICALLY AND FUNCTIONALLY DIVERSE OPERATIONS ARE

VARIED AND OFTEN OFFSETTING IN AMOUNT. THE CORPORATION MAKES LIMITED USE OF

CURRENCY EXCHANGE CONTRACTS TO MITIGATE THE IMPACT OF CHANGES IN CURRENCY

VALUES, AND EXPOSURES RELATED TO THE CORPORATION’S LIMITED USE OF THE CURRENCY

EXCHANGE CONTRACTS ARE NOT MATERIAL.

INFLATION AND OTHER UNCERTAINTIES

THE GENERAL

RATE OF INFLATION IN MANY MAJOR COUNTRIES OF OPERATION HAS REMAINED MODERATE

OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS, AND THE ASSOCIATED IMPACT ON NON-ENERGY COSTS HAS

GENERALLY BEEN MITIGATED BY COST REDUCTIONS FROM EFFICIENCY AND PRODUCTIVITY

IMPROVEMENTS. INCREASED DEMAND FOR CERTAIN SERVICES AND MATERIALS HAS RESULTED

IN HIGHER OPERATING AND CAPITAL COSTS IN RECENT YEARS. THE CORPORATION WORKS TO

COUNTER UPWARD PRESSURE ON COSTS THROUGH ITS ECONOMIES OF SCALE IN GLOBAL

PROCUREMENT AND ITS EFFICIENT PROJECT MANAGEMENT PRACTICES.

54

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL

CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

THE

CORPORATION’S ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL REPORTING FAIRLY REFLECT ITS

STRAIGHTFORWARD BUSINESS MODEL INVOLVING THE EXTRACTING, REFINING AND MARKETING

OF HYDROCARBONS AND HYDROCARBON-BASED PRODUCTS. THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS IN CONFORMITY WITH U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES

(GAAP) REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS THAT AFFECT THE

REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS, LIABILITIES, REVENUES AND EXPENSES AND THE

DISCLOSURE OF CONTINGENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. THE CORPORATION’S ACCOUNTING

POLICIES ARE SUMMARIZED IN NOTE 1.

OIL AND GAS RESERVES

EVALUATIONS

OF OIL AND GAS RESERVES ARE IMPORTANT TO THE EFFECTIVE MANAGEMENT OF UPSTREAM

ASSETS. THEY ARE INTEGRAL TO MAKING INVESTMENT DECISIONS ABOUT OIL AND GAS

PROPERTIES SUCH AS WHETHER DEVELOPMENT SHOULD PROCEED. OIL AND GAS RESERVE

QUANTITIES ARE ALSO USED AS THE BASIS FOR CALCULATING UNIT-OF-PRODUCTION DEPRECIATION

RATES AND FOR EVALUATING IMPAIRMENT.

OIL AND GAS RESERVES INCLUDE BOTH PROVED AND UNPROVED

RESERVES. PROVED OIL AND GAS RESERVES ARE THOSE QUANTITIES OF OIL AND GAS,

WHICH, BY ANALYSIS OF GEOSCIENCE AND ENGINEERING DATA, CAN BE ESTIMATED WITH

REASONABLE CERTAINTY TO BE ECONOMICALLY PRODUCIBLE. UNPROVED RESERVES ARE THOSE

WITH LESS THAN REASONABLE CERTAINTY OF RECOVERABILITY AND INCLUDE PROBABLE

RESERVES. PROBABLE RESERVES ARE RESERVES THAT ARE MORE LIKELY TO BE RECOVERED

THAN NOT.

THE ESTIMATION OF PROVED RESERVES IS AN ONGOING

PROCESS BASED ON RIGOROUS TECHNICAL EVALUATIONS, COMMERCIAL AND MARKET

ASSESSMENT, AND DETAILED ANALYSIS OF WELL INFORMATION SUCH AS FLOW RATES AND

RESERVOIR PRESSURE DECLINES. THE ESTIMATION OF PROVED RESERVES IS CONTROLLED BY

THE CORPORATION THROUGH LONG-STANDING APPROVAL GUIDELINES. RESERVE CHANGES ARE

MADE WITHIN A WELL-ESTABLISHED, DISCIPLINED PROCESS DRIVEN BY SENIOR LEVEL

GEOSCIENCE AND ENGINEERING PROFESSIONALS, ASSISTED BY THE RESERVES TECHNICAL

OVERSIGHT GROUP WHICH HAS SIGNIFICANT TECHNICAL EXPERIENCE, CULMINATING IN

REVIEWS WITH AND APPROVAL BY SENIOR MANAGEMENT. NOTABLY, THE CORPORATION DOES

NOT USE SPECIFIC QUANTITATIVE RESERVE TARGETS TO DETERMINE COMPENSATION. KEY

FEATURES OF THE RESERVE ESTIMATION PROCESS ARE COVERED IN DISCLOSURE OF

RESERVES IN ITEM 2.

ALTHOUGH THE CORPORATION IS REASONABLY CERTAIN THAT

PROVED RESERVES WILL BE PRODUCED, THE TIMING AND AMOUNT RECOVERED CAN BE

AFFECTED BY A NUMBER OF FACTORS INCLUDING COMPLETION OF DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS,

RESERVOIR PERFORMANCE, REGULATORY APPROVALS AND SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN

LONG-TERM OIL AND GAS PRICE LEVELS.

PROVED RESERVES CAN BE FURTHER SUBDIVIDED INTO

DEVELOPED AND UNDEVELOPED RESERVES. THE PERCENTAGE OF PROVED DEVELOPED RESERVES

WAS 61 PERCENT OF TOTAL PROVED RESERVES AT YEAR-END 2012 (INCLUDING BOTH

CONSOLIDATED AND EQUITY COMPANY RESERVES), AND HAS BEEN OVER 60 PERCENT FOR THE

LAST FIVE YEARS, INDICATING THAT PROVED RESERVES ARE CONSISTENTLY MOVED FROM

UNDEVELOPED TO DEVELOPED STATUS.

REVISIONS CAN INCLUDE UPWARD OR DOWNWARD CHANGES IN

PREVIOUSLY ESTIMATED VOLUMES OF PROVED RESERVES FOR EXISTING FIELDS DUE TO THE

EVALUATION OR RE-EVALUATION OF (1) ALREADY AVAILABLE GEOLOGIC, RESERVOIR

OR PRODUCTION DATA, (2) NEW GEOLOGIC, RESERVOIR OR PRODUCTION DATA OR (3) CHANGES

IN PRICES AND YEAR-END COSTS THAT ARE USED IN THE ESTIMATION OF RESERVES.

REVISIONS CAN ALSO RESULT FROM SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY OR

PRODUCTION EQUIPMENT/FACILITY CAPACITY.

IMPACT

OF OIL AND GAS RESERVES ON DEPRECIATION.

THE CALCULATION OF UNIT-OF-PRODUCTION DEPRECIATION IS A CRITICAL ACCOUNTING

ESTIMATE THAT MEASURES THE DEPRECIATION OF UPSTREAM ASSETS. IT IS THE RATIO OF

ACTUAL VOLUMES PRODUCED TO TOTAL PROVED DEVELOPED RESERVES (THOSE PROVED

RESERVES RECOVERABLE THROUGH EXISTING WELLS WITH EXISTING EQUIPMENT AND

OPERATING METHODS), APPLIED TO THE ASSET COST. THE VOLUMES PRODUCED AND ASSET

COST ARE KNOWN AND, WHILE PROVED DEVELOPED RESERVES HAVE A HIGH PROBABILITY OF

RECOVERABILITY, THEY ARE BASED ON ESTIMATES THAT ARE SUBJECT TO SOME

VARIABILITY. WHILE THE REVISIONS THE CORPORATION HAS MADE IN THE PAST ARE AN

INDICATOR OF VARIABILITY, THEY HAVE HAD A VERY SMALL IMPACT ON THE

UNIT-OF-PRODUCTION RATES BECAUSE THEY HAVE BEEN SMALL COMPARED TO THE LARGE

RESERVES BASE.

IMPACT

OF OIL AND GAS RESERVES AND PRICES ON TESTING FOR IMPAIRMENT.

PROVED OIL AND GAS PROPERTIES HELD AND USED BY THE

CORPORATION ARE REVIEWED FOR IMPAIRMENT WHENEVER EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES

INDICATE THAT THE CARRYING AMOUNTS MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE. ASSETS ARE GROUPED

AT THE LOWEST LEVEL FOR WHICH THERE ARE IDENTIFIABLE CASH FLOWS THAT ARE

LARGELY INDEPENDENT OF THE CASH FLOWS OF OTHER GROUPS OF ASSETS.

THE CORPORATION ESTIMATES THE FUTURE UNDISCOUNTED CASH

FLOWS OF THE AFFECTED PROPERTIES TO JUDGE THE RECOVERABILITY OF CARRYING

AMOUNTS. IMPAIRMENT ANALYSES ARE GENERALLY BASED ON PROVED RESERVES. WHERE

PROBABLE RESERVES EXIST, AN APPROPRIATELY RISK-ADJUSTED AMOUNT OF THESE

RESERVES MAY BE INCLUDED IN THE IMPAIRMENT EVALUATION. AN ASSET GROUP WOULD BE

IMPAIRED IF ITS UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS WERE LESS THAN THE ASSET’S CARRYING

VALUE. IMPAIRMENTS ARE MEASURED BY THE AMOUNT BY WHICH THE CARRYING VALUE

EXCEEDS FAIR VALUE.

SIGNIFICANT UNPROVED PROPERTIES ARE ASSESSED FOR

IMPAIRMENT INDIVIDUALLY, AND VALUATION ALLOWANCES AGAINST THE CAPITALIZED COSTS

ARE RECORDED BASED ON THE ESTIMATED ECONOMIC CHANCE OF SUCCESS AND THE LENGTH

OF TIME THAT THE CORPORATION EXPECTS TO HOLD THE PROPERTIES. PROPERTIES THAT

ARE NOT INDIVIDUALLY SIGNIFICANT ARE AGGREGATED BY GROUPS AND AMORTIZED BASED

ON DEVELOPMENT RISK AND AVERAGE HOLDING PERIOD.

55

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL

CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

THE CORPORATION PERFORMS

ASSET VALUATION ANALYSES ON AN ONGOING BASIS AS A PART OF ITS ASSET MANAGEMENT

PROGRAM. THESE ANALYSES ASSIST THE CORPORATION IN ASSESSING WHETHER THE

CARRYING AMOUNTS OF ANY OF ITS ASSETS MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE. IN ADDITION TO

ESTIMATING OIL AND GAS RESERVE VOLUMES IN CONDUCTING THESE ANALYSES, IT IS ALSO

NECESSARY TO ESTIMATE FUTURE OIL AND GAS PRICES. POTENTIAL TRIGGER EVENTS FOR

IMPAIRMENT EVALUATION INCLUDE A SIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN CURRENT AND PROJECTED

RESERVE VOLUMES, AN ACCUMULATION OF PROJECT COSTS SIGNIFICANTLY IN EXCESS OF

THE AMOUNT ORIGINALLY EXPECTED, AND CURRENT PERIOD OPERATING LOSSES COMBINED

WITH A HISTORY AND FORECAST OF OPERATING OR CASH FLOW LOSSES.

IN GENERAL, THE CORPORATION DOES NOT VIEW TEMPORARILY

LOW PRICES OR MARGINS AS A TRIGGER EVENT FOR CONDUCTING THE IMPAIRMENT TESTS.

THE MARKETS FOR CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS HAVE A HISTORY OF SIGNIFICANT PRICE

VOLATILITY. ALTHOUGH PRICES WILL OCCASIONALLY DROP SIGNIFICANTLY, INDUSTRY

PRICES OVER THE LONG TERM WILL CONTINUE TO BE DRIVEN BY MARKET SUPPLY AND

DEMAND. ON THE SUPPLY SIDE, INDUSTRY PRODUCTION FROM MATURE FIELDS IS

DECLINING, BUT THIS IS BEING OFFSET BY PRODUCTION FROM NEW DISCOVERIES AND

FIELD DEVELOPMENTS. OPEC PRODUCTION POLICIES ALSO HAVE AN IMPACT ON WORLD OIL

SUPPLIES. THE DEMAND SIDE IS LARGELY A FUNCTION OF GLOBAL ECONOMIC GROWTH. THE

RELATIVE GROWTH/DECLINE IN SUPPLY VERSUS DEMAND WILL DETERMINE INDUSTRY PRICES

OVER THE LONG TERM, AND THESE CANNOT BE ACCURATELY PREDICTED.

ACCORDINGLY, ANY IMPAIRMENT TESTS THAT THE CORPORATION

PERFORMS MAKE USE OF THE CORPORATION’S PRICE ASSUMPTIONS DEVELOPED IN THE

ANNUAL PLANNING AND BUDGETING PROCESS FOR THE CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS

MARKETS, PETROLEUM PRODUCTS AND CHEMICALS. THESE ARE THE SAME PRICE ASSUMPTIONS

THAT ARE USED FOR CAPITAL INVESTMENT DECISIONS. VOLUMES ARE BASED ON FIELD

PRODUCTION PROFILES, WHICH ARE UPDATED ANNUALLY. CASH FLOW ESTIMATES FOR

IMPAIRMENT TESTING EXCLUDE THE EFFECTS OF DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS.

SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION REGARDING OIL AND GAS RESULTS

OF OPERATIONS, CAPITALIZED COSTS AND RESERVES IS PROVIDED FOLLOWING THE NOTES

TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. FUTURE PRICES USED FOR ANY IMPAIRMENT

TESTS WILL VARY FROM THE ONES USED IN THE SUPPLEMENTAL OIL AND GAS DISCLOSURE

AND COULD BE LOWER OR HIGHER FOR ANY GIVEN YEAR.

ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS

THE

CORPORATION INCURS RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS FOR CERTAIN ASSETS. THE FAIR VALUES

OF THESE OBLIGATIONS ARE RECORDED AS LIABILITIES ON A DISCOUNTED BASIS, WHICH

IS TYPICALLY AT THE TIME THE ASSETS ARE INSTALLED. IN THE ESTIMATION OF FAIR

VALUE, THE CORPORATION USES ASSUMPTIONS AND JUDGMENTS REGARDING SUCH FACTORS AS

THE EXISTENCE OF A LEGAL OBLIGATION FOR AN ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATION;

TECHNICAL ASSESSMENTS OF THE ASSETS; ESTIMATED AMOUNTS AND TIMING OF

SETTLEMENTS; DISCOUNT RATES; AND INFLATION RATES. ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS

ARE DISCLOSED IN NOTE 9 TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

SUSPENDED EXPLORATORY WELL COSTS

THE

CORPORATION CONTINUES CAPITALIZATION OF EXPLORATORY WELL COSTS WHEN THE WELL

HAS FOUND A SUFFICIENT QUANTITY OF RESERVES TO JUSTIFY ITS COMPLETION AS A

PRODUCING WELL AND THE CORPORATION IS MAKING SUFFICIENT PROGRESS ASSESSING THE

RESERVES AND THE ECONOMIC AND OPERATING VIABILITY OF THE PROJECT. EXPLORATORY

WELL COSTS NOT MEETING THESE CRITERIA ARE CHARGED TO EXPENSE. THE FACTS AND

CIRCUMSTANCES THAT SUPPORT CONTINUED CAPITALIZATION OF SUSPENDED WELLS AS OF

YEAR-END 2012 ARE DISCLOSED IN NOTE 10 TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

CONSOLIDATIONS

THE

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDE THE ACCOUNTS OF THOSE SUBSIDIARIES

THAT THE CORPORATION CONTROLS. THEY ALSO INCLUDE THE CORPORATION’S SHARE OF THE

UNDIVIDED INTEREST IN CERTAIN UPSTREAM ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. AMOUNTS REPRESENTING

THE CORPORATION’S INTEREST IN THE UNDERLYING NET ASSETS OF OTHER SIGNIFICANT

ENTITIES THAT IT DOES NOT CONTROL, BUT OVER WHICH IT EXERCISES SIGNIFICANT

INFLUENCE, ARE ACCOUNTED FOR USING THE EQUITY METHOD OF ACCOUNTING.

INVESTMENTS IN COMPANIES THAT ARE PARTIALLY OWNED BY

THE CORPORATION ARE INTEGRAL TO THE CORPORATION’S OPERATIONS. IN SOME CASES

THEY SERVE TO BALANCE WORLDWIDE RISKS, AND IN OTHERS THEY PROVIDE THE ONLY

AVAILABLE MEANS OF ENTRY INTO A PARTICULAR MARKET OR AREA OF INTEREST. THE OTHER

PARTIES WHO ALSO HAVE AN EQUITY INTEREST IN THESE COMPANIES ARE EITHER

INDEPENDENT THIRD PARTIES OR HOST GOVERNMENTS THAT SHARE IN THE BUSINESS

RESULTS ACCORDING TO THEIR OWNERSHIP. THE CORPORATION DOES NOT INVEST IN THESE

COMPANIES IN ORDER TO REMOVE LIABILITIES FROM ITS BALANCE SHEET. IN FACT, THE

CORPORATION HAS LONG BEEN ON RECORD SUPPORTING AN ALTERNATIVE ACCOUNTING METHOD

THAT WOULD REQUIRE EACH INVESTOR TO CONSOLIDATE ITS SHARE OF ALL ASSETS AND

LIABILITIES IN THESE PARTIALLY OWNED COMPANIES RATHER THAN ONLY ITS INTEREST IN

NET EQUITY. THIS METHOD OF ACCOUNTING FOR INVESTMENTS IN PARTIALLY-OWNED

COMPANIES IS NOT PERMITTED BY U.S. GAAP EXCEPT WHERE THE INVESTMENTS ARE IN THE

DIRECT OWNERSHIP OF A SHARE OF UPSTREAM ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. HOWEVER, FOR

PURPOSES OF CALCULATING RETURN ON AVERAGE CAPITAL EMPLOYED, WHICH IS NOT

COVERED BY U.S. GAAP STANDARDS, THE CORPORATION INCLUDES ITS SHARE OF DEBT OF

THESE PARTIALLY-OWNED COMPANIES IN THE DETERMINATION OF AVERAGE CAPITAL

EMPLOYED.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL

CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

PENSION BENEFITS

THE

CORPORATION AND ITS AFFILIATES SPONSOR OVER 100 DEFINED BENEFIT (PENSION) PLANS

IN ABOUT 50 COUNTRIES. PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS (NOTE 17)

PROVIDES DETAILS ON PENSION OBLIGATIONS, FUND ASSETS AND PENSION EXPENSE.

SOME OF THESE PLANS (PRIMARILY NON-U.S.) PROVIDE

PENSION BENEFITS THAT ARE PAID DIRECTLY BY THEIR SPONSORING AFFILIATES OUT OF

CORPORATE CASH FLOW RATHER THAN A SEPARATE PENSION FUND. BOOK RESERVES ARE

ESTABLISHED FOR THESE PLANS BECAUSE TAX CONVENTIONS AND REGULATORY PRACTICES DO

NOT ENCOURAGE ADVANCE FUNDING. THE PORTION OF THE PENSION COST ATTRIBUTABLE TO

EMPLOYEE SERVICE IS EXPENSED AS SERVICES ARE RENDERED. THE PORTION ATTRIBUTABLE

TO THE INCREASE IN PENSION OBLIGATIONS DUE TO THE PASSAGE OF TIME IS EXPENSED

OVER THE TERM OF THE OBLIGATIONS, WHICH ENDS WHEN ALL BENEFITS ARE PAID. THE

PRIMARY DIFFERENCE IN PENSION EXPENSE FOR UNFUNDED VERSUS FUNDED PLANS IS THAT

PENSION EXPENSE FOR FUNDED PLANS ALSO INCLUDES A CREDIT FOR THE EXPECTED

LONG-TERM RETURN ON FUND ASSETS.

FOR FUNDED PLANS, INCLUDING THOSE IN THE U.S., PENSION

OBLIGATIONS ARE FINANCED IN ADVANCE THROUGH SEGREGATED ASSETS OR INSURANCE

ARRANGEMENTS. THESE PLANS ARE MANAGED IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE REQUIREMENTS OF

GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORITIES AND MEET OR EXCEED REQUIRED FUNDING LEVELS AS MEASURED

BY RELEVANT ACTUARIAL AND GOVERNMENT STANDARDS AT THE MANDATED MEASUREMENT

DATES. IN DETERMINING LIABILITIES AND REQUIRED CONTRIBUTIONS, THESE STANDARDS

OFTEN REQUIRE APPROACHES AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT DIFFER FROM THOSE USED FOR ACCOUNTING

PURPOSES.

THE CORPORATION WILL CONTINUE TO MAKE CONTRIBUTIONS TO

THESE FUNDED PLANS AS NECESSARY. ALL DEFINED-BENEFIT PENSION OBLIGATIONS,

REGARDLESS OF THE FUNDING STATUS OF THE UNDERLYING PLANS, ARE FULLY SUPPORTED

BY THE FINANCIAL STRENGTH OF THE CORPORATION OR THE RESPECTIVE SPONSORING

AFFILIATE.

PENSION ACCOUNTING REQUIRES EXPLICIT ASSUMPTIONS

REGARDING, AMONG OTHERS, THE LONG-TERM EXPECTED EARNINGS RATE ON FUND ASSETS,

THE DISCOUNT RATE FOR THE BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS AND THE LONG-TERM RATE FOR FUTURE

SALARY INCREASES. PENSION ASSUMPTIONS ARE REVIEWED ANNUALLY BY OUTSIDE

ACTUARIES AND SENIOR MANAGEMENT. THESE ASSUMPTIONS ARE ADJUSTED AS APPROPRIATE

TO REFLECT CHANGES IN MARKET RATES AND OUTLOOK. THE LONG-TERM EXPECTED EARNINGS

RATE ON U.S. PENSION PLAN ASSETS IN 2012 WAS 7.25 PERCENT. THE 10‐YEAR

AND 20‐YEAR ACTUAL RETURNS ON U.S. PENSION PLAN ASSETS WERE BOTH 9 PERCENT.

THE CORPORATION ESTABLISHES THE LONG-TERM EXPECTED RATE OF RETURN BY DEVELOPING

A FORWARD-LOOKING, LONG-TERM RETURN ASSUMPTION FOR EACH PENSION FUND ASSET

CLASS, TAKING INTO ACCOUNT FACTORS SUCH AS THE EXPECTED REAL RETURN FOR THE

SPECIFIC ASSET CLASS AND INFLATION. A SINGLE, LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN IS THEN

CALCULATED AS THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE OF THE TARGET ASSET ALLOCATION PERCENTAGES AND

THE LONG-TERM RETURN ASSUMPTION FOR EACH ASSET CLASS. A WORLDWIDE REDUCTION OF

0.5 PERCENT IN THE LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN ON ASSETS WOULD INCREASE ANNUAL

PENSION EXPENSE BY APPROXIMATELY $150 MILLION BEFORE TAX.

DIFFERENCES BETWEEN ACTUAL RETURNS ON FUND ASSETS AND

THE LONG-TERM EXPECTED RETURN ARE NOT RECOGNIZED IN PENSION EXPENSE IN THE YEAR

THAT THE DIFFERENCE OCCURS. SUCH DIFFERENCES ARE DEFERRED, ALONG WITH OTHER

ACTUARIAL GAINS AND LOSSES, AND ARE AMORTIZED INTO PENSION EXPENSE OVER THE

EXPECTED REMAINING SERVICE LIFE OF EMPLOYEES.

LITIGATION CONTINGENCIES

A

VARIETY OF CLAIMS HAVE BEEN MADE AGAINST THE CORPORATION AND CERTAIN OF ITS

CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES IN A NUMBER OF PENDING LAWSUITS. MANAGEMENT HAS

REGULAR LITIGATION REVIEWS, INCLUDING UPDATES FROM CORPORATE AND OUTSIDE

COUNSEL, TO ASSESS THE NEED FOR ACCOUNTING RECOGNITION OR DISCLOSURE OF THESE

CONTINGENCIES. THE STATUS OF SIGNIFICANT CLAIMS IS SUMMARIZED IN NOTE 16.

THE CORPORATION ACCRUES AN UNDISCOUNTED LIABILITY FOR

THOSE CONTINGENCIES WHERE THE INCURRENCE OF A LOSS IS PROBABLE, AND THE AMOUNT

CAN BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED. THESE AMOUNTS ARE NOT REDUCED BY AMOUNTS THAT MAY

BE RECOVERED UNDER INSURANCE OR CLAIMS AGAINST THIRD PARTIES, BUT UNDISCOUNTED

RECEIVABLES FROM INSURERS OR OTHER THIRD PARTIES MAY BE ACCRUED SEPARATELY. THE

CORPORATION REVISES SUCH ACCRUALS IN LIGHT OF NEW INFORMATION. FOR

CONTINGENCIES WHERE AN UNFAVORABLE OUTCOME IS REASONABLY POSSIBLE AND WHICH ARE

SIGNIFICANT, THE CORPORATION DISCLOSES THE NATURE OF THE CONTINGENCY AND, WHERE

FEASIBLE, AN ESTIMATE OF THE POSSIBLE LOSS. FOR PURPOSES OF OUR LITIGATION

CONTINGENCY DISCLOSURES, “SIGNIFICANT” INCLUDES MATERIAL MATTERS AS WELL AS

OTHER ITEMS WHICH MANAGEMENT BELIEVES SHOULD BE DISCLOSED.

MANAGEMENT JUDGMENT IS REQUIRED RELATED TO CONTINGENT

LIABILITIES AND THE OUTCOME OF LITIGATION BECAUSE BOTH ARE DIFFICULT TO

PREDICT. HOWEVER, THE CORPORATION HAS BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN DEFENDING LITIGATION

IN THE PAST. PAYMENTS HAVE NOT HAD A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OPERATIONS OR FINANCIAL

CONDITION. IN THE CORPORATION’S EXPERIENCE, LARGE CLAIMS OFTEN DO NOT RESULT IN

LARGE AWARDS. LARGE AWARDS ARE OFTEN REVERSED OR SUBSTANTIALLY REDUCED AS A

RESULT OF APPEAL OR SETTLEMENT.

TAX CONTINGENCIES

THE

CORPORATION IS SUBJECT TO INCOME TAXATION IN MANY JURISDICTIONS AROUND THE

WORLD. SIGNIFICANT MANAGEMENT JUDGMENT IS REQUIRED IN THE ACCOUNTING FOR INCOME

TAX CONTINGENCIES AND TAX DISPUTES BECAUSE THE OUTCOMES ARE OFTEN DIFFICULT TO

PREDICT.

THE BENEFITS OF UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS

THAT THE CORPORATION HAS TAKEN OR EXPECTS TO TAKE IN ITS INCOME TAX RETURNS ARE

RECOGNIZED IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IF MANAGEMENT CONCLUDES THAT IT IS MORE

LIKELY THAN NOT THAT THE POSITION WILL BE SUSTAINED

57

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL

CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

WITH

THE TAX AUTHORITIES. FOR A POSITION THAT IS LIKELY TO BE SUSTAINED, THE BENEFIT

RECOGNIZED IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IS MEASURED AT THE LARGEST AMOUNT THAT

IS GREATER THAN 50 PERCENT LIKELY OF BEING REALIZED. A RESERVE IS ESTABLISHED

FOR THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A POSITION TAKEN OR EXPECTED TO BE TAKEN IN AN

INCOME TAX RETURN AND THE AMOUNT RECOGNIZED IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. THE

CORPORATION’S UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS AND A DESCRIPTION OF OPEN TAX YEARS ARE

SUMMARIZED IN NOTE 19.

FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION

THE

METHOD OF TRANSLATING THE FOREIGN CURRENCY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF THE

CORPORATION’S INTERNATIONAL SUBSIDIARIES INTO U.S. DOLLARS IS PRESCRIBED BY

GAAP. UNDER THESE PRINCIPLES, IT IS NECESSARY TO SELECT THE FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY

OF THESE SUBSIDIARIES. THE FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY IS THE CURRENCY OF THE PRIMARY

ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH THE SUBSIDIARY OPERATES. MANAGEMENT SELECTS THE

FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY AFTER EVALUATING THIS ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT.

FACTORS CONSIDERED BY MANAGEMENT WHEN DETERMINING THE

FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY FOR A SUBSIDIARY INCLUDE THE CURRENCY USED FOR CASH FLOWS

RELATED TO INDIVIDUAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES; THE RESPONSIVENESS OF SALES

PRICES TO CHANGES IN EXCHANGE RATES; THE HISTORY OF INFLATION IN THE COUNTRY;

WHETHER SALES ARE INTO LOCAL MARKETS OR EXPORTED; THE CURRENCY USED TO ACQUIRE

RAW MATERIALS, LABOR, SERVICES AND SUPPLIES; SOURCES OF FINANCING; AND

SIGNIFICANCE OF INTERCOMPANY TRANSACTIONS.

MANAGEMENT’S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL

REPORTING

MANAGEMENT, INCLUDING THE CORPORATION’S CHIEF

EXECUTIVE OFFICER, PRINCIPAL FINANCIAL OFFICER, AND PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING

OFFICER, IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ESTABLISHING AND MAINTAINING ADEQUATE INTERNAL

CONTROL OVER THE CORPORATION’S FINANCIAL REPORTING. MANAGEMENT CONDUCTED AN

EVALUATION OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

BASED ON CRITERIA ESTABLISHED IN

INTERNAL CONTROL – INTEGRATED

FRAMEWORK

ISSUED BY THE COMMITTEE OF SPONSORING ORGANIZATIONS OF THE

TREADWAY COMMISSION. BASED ON THIS EVALUATION, MANAGEMENT CONCLUDED THAT EXXON

MOBIL CORPORATION’S INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING WAS EFFECTIVE AS

OF DECEMBER 31, 2012.

PRICEWATERHOUSECOOPERS LLP, AN INDEPENDENT REGISTERED

PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM, AUDITED THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE CORPORATION’S INTERNAL

CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2012, AS STATED IN

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC

ACCOUNTING FIRM

TO THE SHAREHOLDERS OF EXXON MOBIL

CORPORATION.

IN OUR OPINION, THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED BALANCE

SHEETS AND THE RELATED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME, COMPREHENSIVE INCOME,

CHANGES IN EQUITY AND CASH FLOWS PRESENT FAIRLY, IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS, THE

FINANCIAL POSITION OF EXXON MOBIL CORPORATION AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES AT

DECEMBER 31, 2012, AND 2011, AND THE RESULTS OF THEIR OPERATIONS AND THEIR

CASH FLOWS FOR EACH OF THE THREE YEARS IN THE PERIOD ENDED DECEMBER 31,

2012, IN CONFORMITY WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED

STATES OF AMERICA. ALSO IN OUR OPINION, THE CORPORATION MAINTAINED, IN ALL

MATERIAL RESPECTS, EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2012, BASED ON CRITERIA ESTABLISHED IN

INTERNAL CONTROL –

INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK

ISSUED BY THE COMMITTEE OF SPONSORING ORGANIZATIONS OF

THE TREADWAY COMMISSION (COSO). THE CORPORATION’S MANAGEMENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR

THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, FOR MAINTAINING EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER

FINANCIAL REPORTING AND FOR ITS ASSESSMENT OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL

CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, INCLUDED IN THE ACCOMPANYING MANAGEMENT’S

REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING. OUR RESPONSIBILITY IS TO

EXPRESS OPINIONS ON THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND ON THE CORPORATION’S

INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING BASED ON OUR INTEGRATED AUDITS. WE

CONDUCTED OUR AUDITS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE STANDARDS OF THE PUBLIC COMPANY

ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BOARD (UNITED STATES). THOSE STANDARDS REQUIRE THAT WE

PLAN AND PERFORM THE AUDITS TO OBTAIN REASONABLE ASSURANCE ABOUT WHETHER THE

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE FREE OF MATERIAL MISSTATEMENT AND WHETHER EFFECTIVE

INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING WAS MAINTAINED IN ALL MATERIAL

RESPECTS. OUR AUDITS OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED EXAMINING, ON A TEST

BASIS, EVIDENCE SUPPORTING THE AMOUNTS AND DISCLOSURES IN THE FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS, ASSESSING THE ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES USED AND SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES

MADE BY MANAGEMENT, AND EVALUATING THE OVERALL FINANCIAL STATEMENT PRESENTATION.

OUR AUDIT OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING INCLUDED OBTAINING AN

UNDERSTANDING OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, ASSESSING THE RISK

THAT A MATERIAL WEAKNESS EXISTS, AND TESTING AND EVALUATING THE DESIGN AND

OPERATING EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL CONTROL BASED ON THE ASSESSED RISK. OUR

AUDITS ALSO INCLUDED PERFORMING SUCH OTHER PROCEDURES AS WE CONSIDERED

NECESSARY IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR AUDITS PROVIDE A REASONABLE

BASIS FOR OUR OPINIONS.

A COMPANY’S INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

IS A PROCESS DESIGNED TO PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING THE RELIABILITY

OF FINANCIAL REPORTING AND THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR EXTERNAL

PURPOSES IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES. A

COMPANY’S INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING INCLUDES THOSE POLICIES AND

PROCEDURES THAT (I) PERTAIN TO THE MAINTENANCE OF RECORDS THAT, IN

REASONABLE DETAIL, ACCURATELY AND FAIRLY REFLECT THE TRANSACTIONS AND

DISPOSITIONS OF THE ASSETS OF THE COMPANY; (II) PROVIDE REASONABLE

ASSURANCE THAT TRANSACTIONS ARE RECORDED AS NECESSARY TO PERMIT PREPARATION OF

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING

PRINCIPLES, AND THAT RECEIPTS AND EXPENDITURES OF THE COMPANY ARE BEING MADE

ONLY IN ACCORDANCE WITH AUTHORIZATIONS OF MANAGEMENT AND DIRECTORS OF THE

COMPANY; AND (III) PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING PREVENTION OR

TIMELY DETECTION OF UNAUTHORIZED ACQUISITION, USE, OR DISPOSITION OF THE

COMPANY’S ASSETS THAT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

BECAUSE OF ITS INHERENT LIMITATIONS, INTERNAL CONTROL

OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING MAY NOT PREVENT OR DETECT MISSTATEMENTS. ALSO,

PROJECTIONS OF ANY EVALUATION OF EFFECTIVENESS TO FUTURE PERIODS ARE SUBJECT TO

THE RISK THAT CONTROLS MAY BECOME INADEQUATE BECAUSE OF CHANGES IN CONDITIONS,

OR THAT THE DEGREE OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE POLICIES OR PROCEDURES MAY

DETERIORATE.

THE

INFORMATION IN THE NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IS AN INTEGRAL

PART OF THESE STATEMENTS.

65

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND

THE SUPPORTING AND SUPPLEMENTAL MATERIAL ARE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE

MANAGEMENT OF EXXON MOBIL CORPORATION.

THE CORPORATION’S PRINCIPAL BUSINESS IS ENERGY,

INVOLVING THE WORLDWIDE EXPLORATION, PRODUCTION, TRANSPORTATION AND SALE OF

CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS (UPSTREAM) AND THE MANUFACTURE, TRANSPORTATION AND

SALE OF PETROLEUM PRODUCTS (DOWNSTREAM). THE CORPORATION IS ALSO A MAJOR

WORLDWIDE MANUFACTURER AND MARKETER OF PETROCHEMICALS (CHEMICAL) AND

PARTICIPATES IN ELECTRIC POWER GENERATION (UPSTREAM).

THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN CONFORMITY

WITH U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES (GAAP) REQUIRES MANAGEMENT

TO MAKE ESTIMATES THAT AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS, LIABILITIES,

REVENUES AND EXPENSES AND THE DISCLOSURE OF CONTINGENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES.

ACTUAL RESULTS COULD DIFFER FROM THESE ESTIMATES. PRIOR YEARS’ DATA HAS BEEN

RECLASSIFIED IN CERTAIN CASES TO CONFORM TO THE 2012 PRESENTATION BASIS.

1. SUMMARY OF ACCOUNTING POLICIES

PRINCIPLES

OF CONSOLIDATION.

THE CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDE THE ACCOUNTS OF SUBSIDIARIES THE CORPORATION

CONTROLS. THEY ALSO INCLUDE THE CORPORATION’S SHARE OF THE UNDIVIDED INTEREST

IN CERTAIN UPSTREAM ASSETS AND LIABILITIES.

AMOUNTS REPRESENTING THE CORPORATION’S INTEREST IN

ENTITIES THAT IT DOES NOT CONTROL, BUT OVER WHICH IT EXERCISES SIGNIFICANT

INFLUENCE, ARE INCLUDED IN “INVESTMENTS, ADVANCES AND LONG-TERM RECEIVABLES.”

THE CORPORATION’S SHARE OF THE NET INCOME OF THESE COMPANIES IS INCLUDED IN THE

CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF INCOME CAPTION “INCOME FROM EQUITY AFFILIATES.”

MAJORITY OWNERSHIP IS NORMALLY THE INDICATOR OF

CONTROL THAT IS THE BASIS ON WHICH SUBSIDIARIES ARE CONSOLIDATED. HOWEVER,

CERTAIN FACTORS MAY INDICATE THAT A MAJORITY-OWNED INVESTMENT IS NOT CONTROLLED

AND THEREFORE SHOULD BE ACCOUNTED FOR USING THE EQUITY METHOD OF ACCOUNTING.

THESE FACTORS OCCUR WHERE THE MINORITY SHAREHOLDERS ARE GRANTED BY LAW OR BY

CONTRACT SUBSTANTIVE PARTICIPATING RIGHTS. THESE INCLUDE THE RIGHT TO APPROVE

OPERATING POLICIES, EXPENSE BUDGETS, FINANCING AND INVESTMENT PLANS, AND

MANAGEMENT COMPENSATION AND SUCCESSION PLANS.

THE CORPORATION’S SHARE OF THE CUMULATIVE FOREIGN

EXCHANGE TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENT FOR EQUITY METHOD INVESTMENTS IS REPORTED IN ACCUMULATED

OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME.

EVIDENCE OF LOSS IN VALUE THAT MIGHT INDICATE

IMPAIRMENT OF INVESTMENTS IN COMPANIES ACCOUNTED FOR ON THE EQUITY METHOD IS

ASSESSED TO DETERMINE IF SUCH EVIDENCE REPRESENTS A LOSS IN VALUE OF THE

CORPORATION’S INVESTMENT THAT IS OTHER THAN TEMPORARY. EXAMPLES OF KEY

INDICATORS INCLUDE A HISTORY OF OPERATING LOSSES, A NEGATIVE EARNINGS AND CASH

FLOW OUTLOOK, SIGNIFICANT DOWNWARD REVISIONS TO OIL AND GAS RESERVES, AND THE

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND PROSPECTS FOR THE INVESTEE’S BUSINESS SEGMENT OR

GEOGRAPHIC REGION. IF EVIDENCE OF AN OTHER THAN TEMPORARY LOSS IN FAIR VALUE

BELOW CARRYING AMOUNT IS DETERMINED, AN IMPAIRMENT IS RECOGNIZED. IN THE

ABSENCE OF MARKET PRICES FOR THE INVESTMENT, DISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS ARE USED TO

ASSESS FAIR VALUE.

REVENUE

RECOGNITION.

THE CORPORATION

GENERALLY SELLS CRUDE OIL, NATURAL GAS AND PETROLEUM AND CHEMICAL PRODUCTS

UNDER SHORT-TERM AGREEMENTS AT PREVAILING MARKET PRICES. IN SOME CASES (E.G.,

NATURAL GAS), PRODUCTS MAY BE SOLD UNDER LONG-TERM AGREEMENTS, WITH PERIODIC

PRICE ADJUSTMENTS. REVENUES ARE RECOGNIZED WHEN THE PRODUCTS ARE DELIVERED,

WHICH OCCURS WHEN THE CUSTOMER HAS TAKEN TITLE AND HAS ASSUMED THE RISKS AND

REWARDS OF OWNERSHIP, PRICES ARE FIXED OR DETERMINABLE AND COLLECTIBILITY IS

REASONABLY ASSURED.

REVENUES FROM THE PRODUCTION OF NATURAL GAS PROPERTIES

IN WHICH THE CORPORATION HAS AN INTEREST WITH OTHER PRODUCERS ARE RECOGNIZED ON

THE BASIS OF THE CORPORATION’S NET WORKING INTEREST. DIFFERENCES BETWEEN ACTUAL

PRODUCTION AND NET WORKING INTEREST VOLUMES ARE NOT SIGNIFICANT.

PURCHASES AND SALES OF INVENTORY WITH THE SAME

COUNTERPARTY THAT ARE ENTERED INTO IN CONTEMPLATION OF ONE ANOTHER ARE COMBINED

AND RECORDED AS EXCHANGES MEASURED AT THE BOOK VALUE OF THE ITEM SOLD.

SALES-BASED

TAXES.

THE CORPORATION REPORTS SALES,

EXCISE AND VALUE-ADDED TAXES ON SALES TRANSACTIONS ON A GROSS BASIS IN THE

CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF INCOME (INCLUDED IN BOTH REVENUES AND COSTS).

DERIVATIVE

INSTRUMENTS.

THE CORPORATION MAKES

LIMITED USE OF DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS. THE CORPORATION DOES NOT ENGAGE IN

SPECULATIVE DERIVATIVE ACTIVITIES OR DERIVATIVE TRADING ACTIVITIES, NOR DOES IT

USE DERIVATIVES WITH LEVERAGED FEATURES. WHEN THE CORPORATION DOES ENTER INTO

DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS, IT IS TO OFFSET EXPOSURES ASSOCIATED WITH INTEREST

RATES, FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES AND HYDROCARBON PRICES THAT ARISE FROM

EXISTING ASSETS, LIABILITIES AND FORECASTED TRANSACTIONS.

THE GAINS AND LOSSES RESULTING FROM CHANGES IN THE

FAIR VALUE OF DERIVATIVES ARE RECORDED IN INCOME. IN SOME CASES, THE

CORPORATION DESIGNATES DERIVATIVES AS FAIR VALUE HEDGES, IN WHICH CASE THE

GAINS AND LOSSES ARE OFFSET IN INCOME BY THE GAINS AND LOSSES ARISING FROM

CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE UNDERLYING HEDGED ITEM.

FAIR

VALUE.

FAIR VALUE IS THE PRICE THAT

WOULD BE RECEIVED TO SELL AN ASSET OR PAID TO TRANSFER A LIABILITY IN AN

ORDERLY TRANSACTION BETWEEN MARKET PARTICIPANTS. HIERARCHY LEVELS 1, 2 AND 3

ARE TERMS FOR THE PRIORITY OF INPUTS TO VALUATION TECHNIQUES USED TO MEASURE

FAIR VALUE. HIERARCHY LEVEL 1 INPUTS ARE QUOTED PRICES IN ACTIVE MARKETS FOR

IDENTICAL ASSETS OR LIABILITIES. HIERARCHY

66

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

LEVEL 2

INPUTS ARE INPUTS OTHER THAN QUOTED PRICES INCLUDED WITHIN LEVEL 1 THAT

ARE DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY OBSERVABLE FOR THE ASSET OR LIABILITY. HIERARCHY

LEVEL 3 INPUTS ARE INPUTS THAT ARE NOT OBSERVABLE IN THE MARKET.

INVENTORIES.

CRUDE OIL, PRODUCTS AND MERCHANDISE

INVENTORIES ARE CARRIED AT THE LOWER OF CURRENT MARKET VALUE OR COST (GENERALLY

DETERMINED UNDER THE LAST-IN, FIRST-OUT METHOD – LIFO). INVENTORY COSTS INCLUDE

EXPENDITURES AND OTHER CHARGES (INCLUDING DEPRECIATION) DIRECTLY AND INDIRECTLY

INCURRED IN BRINGING THE INVENTORY TO ITS EXISTING CONDITION AND LOCATION.

SELLING EXPENSES AND GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES ARE REPORTED AS PERIOD

COSTS AND EXCLUDED FROM INVENTORY COST. INVENTORIES OF MATERIALS AND SUPPLIES

ARE VALUED AT COST OR LESS.

PROPERTY,

PLANT AND EQUIPMENT.

DEPRECIATION,

DEPLETION AND AMORTIZATION, BASED ON COST LESS ESTIMATED SALVAGE VALUE OF THE

ASSET, ARE PRIMARILY DETERMINED UNDER EITHER THE UNIT-OF-PRODUCTION METHOD OR

THE STRAIGHT-LINE METHOD, WHICH IS BASED ON ESTIMATED ASSET SERVICE LIFE TAKING

OBSOLESCENCE INTO CONSIDERATION. MAINTENANCE AND REPAIRS, INCLUDING PLANNED

MAJOR MAINTENANCE, ARE EXPENSED AS INCURRED. MAJOR RENEWALS AND IMPROVEMENTS

ARE CAPITALIZED AND THE ASSETS REPLACED ARE RETIRED.

INTEREST COSTS INCURRED TO FINANCE EXPENDITURES DURING

THE CONSTRUCTION PHASE OF MULTIYEAR PROJECTS ARE CAPITALIZED AS PART OF THE

HISTORICAL COST OF ACQUIRING THE CONSTRUCTED ASSETS. THE PROJECT CONSTRUCTION

PHASE COMMENCES WITH THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE DETAILED ENGINEERING DESIGN AND

ENDS WHEN THE CONSTRUCTED ASSETS ARE READY FOR THEIR INTENDED USE. CAPITALIZED

INTEREST COSTS ARE INCLUDED IN PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT AND ARE

DEPRECIATED OVER THE SERVICE LIFE OF THE RELATED ASSETS.

THE CORPORATION USES THE “SUCCESSFUL EFFORTS” METHOD

TO ACCOUNT FOR ITS EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION ACTIVITIES. UNDER THIS METHOD,

COSTS ARE ACCUMULATED ON A FIELD-BY-FIELD BASIS WITH CERTAIN EXPLORATORY

EXPENDITURES AND EXPLORATORY DRY HOLES BEING EXPENSED AS INCURRED. COSTS OF

PRODUCTIVE WELLS AND DEVELOPMENT DRY HOLES ARE CAPITALIZED AND AMORTIZED ON THE

UNIT-OF-PRODUCTION METHOD.

THE CORPORATION CARRIES AS AN ASSET EXPLORATORY WELL

COSTS WHEN THE WELL HAS FOUND A SUFFICIENT QUANTITY OF RESERVES TO JUSTIFY ITS

COMPLETION AS A PRODUCING WELL AND WHERE THE CORPORATION IS MAKING SUFFICIENT PROGRESS

ASSESSING THE RESERVES AND THE ECONOMIC AND OPERATING VIABILITY OF THE PROJECT.

EXPLORATORY WELL COSTS NOT MEETING THESE CRITERIA ARE CHARGED TO EXPENSE. OTHER

EXPLORATORY EXPENDITURES, INCLUDING GEOPHYSICAL COSTS AND ANNUAL LEASE RENTALS,

ARE EXPENSED AS INCURRED.

ACQUISITION COSTS OF PROVED PROPERTIES ARE AMORTIZED

USING A UNIT-OF-PRODUCTION METHOD, COMPUTED ON THE BASIS OF TOTAL PROVED OIL

AND GAS RESERVES.

CAPITALIZED EXPLORATORY DRILLING AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS

ASSOCIATED WITH PRODUCTIVE DEPLETABLE EXTRACTIVE PROPERTIES ARE AMORTIZED USING

UNIT-OF-PRODUCTION RATES BASED ON THE AMOUNT OF PROVED DEVELOPED RESERVES OF

OIL, GAS AND OTHER MINERALS THAT ARE ESTIMATED TO BE RECOVERABLE FROM EXISTING

FACILITIES USING CURRENT OPERATING METHODS.

UNDER THE UNIT-OF-PRODUCTION METHOD, OIL AND GAS

VOLUMES ARE CONSIDERED PRODUCED ONCE THEY HAVE BEEN MEASURED THROUGH METERS AT

CUSTODY TRANSFER OR SALES TRANSACTION POINTS AT THE OUTLET VALVE ON THE LEASE

OR FIELD STORAGE TANK.

PRODUCTION COSTS ARE EXPENSED AS INCURRED. PRODUCTION

INVOLVES LIFTING THE OIL AND GAS TO THE SURFACE AND GATHERING, TREATING, FIELD

PROCESSING AND FIELD STORAGE OF THE OIL AND GAS. THE PRODUCTION FUNCTION

NORMALLY TERMINATES AT THE OUTLET VALVE ON THE LEASE OR FIELD PRODUCTION

STORAGE TANK. PRODUCTION COSTS ARE THOSE INCURRED TO OPERATE AND MAINTAIN THE

CORPORATION’S WELLS AND RELATED EQUIPMENT AND FACILITIES. THEY BECOME PART OF

THE COST OF OIL AND GAS PRODUCED. THESE COSTS, SOMETIMES REFERRED TO AS LIFTING

COSTS, INCLUDE SUCH ITEMS AS LABOR COSTS TO OPERATE THE WELLS AND RELATED

EQUIPMENT; REPAIR AND MAINTENANCE COSTS ON THE WELLS AND EQUIPMENT; MATERIALS,

SUPPLIES AND ENERGY COSTS REQUIRED TO OPERATE THE WELLS AND RELATED EQUIPMENT;

AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES RELATED TO THE PRODUCTION ACTIVITY.

PROVED OIL AND GAS PROPERTIES HELD AND USED BY THE

CORPORATION ARE REVIEWED FOR IMPAIRMENT WHENEVER EVENTS OR CHANGES IN

CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THAT THE CARRYING AMOUNTS MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE. ASSETS

ARE GROUPED AT THE LOWEST LEVEL FOR WHICH THERE ARE IDENTIFIABLE CASH FLOWS

THAT ARE LARGELY INDEPENDENT OF THE CASH FLOWS OF OTHER GROUPS OF ASSETS.

THE CORPORATION ESTIMATES THE FUTURE UNDISCOUNTED CASH

FLOWS OF THE AFFECTED PROPERTIES TO JUDGE THE RECOVERABILITY OF CARRYING

AMOUNTS. CASH FLOWS USED IN IMPAIRMENT EVALUATIONS ARE DEVELOPED USING ANNUALLY

UPDATED CORPORATE PLAN INVESTMENT EVALUATION ASSUMPTIONS FOR CRUDE OIL

COMMODITY PRICES, REFINING AND CHEMICAL MARGINS AND FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE

RATES. ANNUAL VOLUMES ARE BASED ON FIELD PRODUCTION PROFILES, WHICH ARE ALSO

UPDATED ANNUALLY. PRICES FOR NATURAL GAS AND OTHER PRODUCTS ARE BASED ON

CORPORATE PLAN ASSUMPTIONS DEVELOPED ANNUALLY BY MAJOR REGION AND ALSO FOR

INVESTMENT EVALUATION PURPOSES. CASH FLOW ESTIMATES FOR IMPAIRMENT TESTING EXCLUDE

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS.

IMPAIRMENT ANALYSES ARE GENERALLY BASED ON PROVED

RESERVES. WHERE PROBABLE RESERVES EXIST, AN APPROPRIATELY RISK-ADJUSTED AMOUNT

OF THESE RESERVES MAY BE INCLUDED IN THE IMPAIRMENT EVALUATION. AN ASSET GROUP

WOULD BE IMPAIRED IF THE UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS WERE LESS THAN ITS CARRYING

VALUE.  IMPAIRMENTS ARE MEASURED BY THE AMOUNT THE CARRYING VALUE EXCEEDS FAIR

VALUE.

SIGNIFICANT UNPROVED PROPERTIES ARE ASSESSED FOR

IMPAIRMENT INDIVIDUALLY, AND VALUATION ALLOWANCES AGAINST THE CAPITALIZED COSTS

ARE RECORDED BASED ON THE ESTIMATED ECONOMIC CHANCE OF SUCCESS AND THE LENGTH

OF TIME THAT THE CORPORATION EXPECTS TO HOLD THE PROPERTIES. PROPERTIES THAT

ARE NOT INDIVIDUALLY SIGNIFICANT ARE AGGREGATED BY GROUPS AND AMORTIZED BASED

ON DEVELOPMENT RISK AND AVERAGE HOLDING PERIOD. THE VALUATION ALLOWANCES ARE

REVIEWED AT LEAST ANNUALLY.

67

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

GAINS ON SALES OF PROVED

AND UNPROVED PROPERTIES ARE ONLY RECOGNIZED WHEN THERE IS NEITHER UNCERTAINTY

ABOUT THE RECOVERY OF COSTS APPLICABLE TO ANY INTEREST RETAINED NOR ANY

SUBSTANTIAL OBLIGATION FOR FUTURE PERFORMANCE BY THE CORPORATION.

LOSSES ON PROPERTIES SOLD ARE RECOGNIZED WHEN INCURRED

OR WHEN THE PROPERTIES ARE HELD FOR SALE AND THE FAIR VALUE OF THE PROPERTIES

IS LESS THAN THE CARRYING VALUE.

ASSET

RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS AND ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES.

THE CORPORATION INCURS RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS FOR

CERTAIN ASSETS. THE FAIR VALUES OF THESE OBLIGATIONS ARE RECORDED AS

LIABILITIES ON A DISCOUNTED BASIS, WHICH IS TYPICALLY AT THE TIME THE ASSETS

ARE INSTALLED. THE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THESE LIABILITIES ARE CAPITALIZED AS

PART OF THE RELATED ASSETS AND DEPRECIATED. OVER TIME, THE LIABILITIES ARE

ACCRETED FOR THE CHANGE IN THEIR PRESENT VALUE.

LIABILITIES FOR ENVIRONMENTAL COSTS ARE RECORDED WHEN

IT IS PROBABLE THAT OBLIGATIONS HAVE BEEN INCURRED AND THE AMOUNTS CAN BE

REASONABLY ESTIMATED. THESE LIABILITIES ARE NOT REDUCED BY POSSIBLE RECOVERIES

FROM THIRD PARTIES AND PROJECTED CASH EXPENDITURES ARE NOT DISCOUNTED.

FOREIGN

CURRENCY TRANSLATION.

THE CORPORATION

SELECTS THE FUNCTIONAL REPORTING CURRENCY FOR ITS INTERNATIONAL SUBSIDIARIES

BASED ON THE CURRENCY OF THE PRIMARY ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH EACH

SUBSIDIARY OPERATES.

DOWNSTREAM AND CHEMICAL OPERATIONS PRIMARILY USE THE

LOCAL CURRENCY. HOWEVER, THE U.S. DOLLAR IS USED IN COUNTRIES WITH A HISTORY OF

HIGH INFLATION (PRIMARILY IN LATIN AMERICA) AND SINGAPORE, WHICH PREDOMINANTLY

SELLS INTO THE U.S. DOLLAR EXPORT MARKET. UPSTREAM OPERATIONS WHICH ARE

RELATIVELY SELF-CONTAINED AND INTEGRATED WITHIN A PARTICULAR COUNTRY, SUCH AS

CANADA, THE UNITED KINGDOM, NORWAY AND CONTINENTAL EUROPE, USE THE LOCAL

CURRENCY. SOME UPSTREAM OPERATIONS, PRIMARILY IN ASIA AND AFRICA, USE THE U.S.

DOLLAR BECAUSE THEY PREDOMINANTLY SELL CRUDE AND NATURAL GAS PRODUCTION INTO

U.S. DOLLAR-DENOMINATED MARKETS.

FOR ALL OPERATIONS, GAINS OR LOSSES FROM REMEASURING

FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSACTIONS INTO THE FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY ARE INCLUDED IN

INCOME.

STOCK-BASED

PAYMENTS.

THE CORPORATION AWARDS

STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION TO EMPLOYEES IN THE FORM OF RESTRICTED STOCK AND

RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS. COMPENSATION EXPENSE IS MEASURED BY THE MARKET PRICE OF

THE RESTRICTED SHARES AT THE DATE OF GRANT AND IS RECOGNIZED IN THE INCOME

STATEMENT OVER THE REQUISITE SERVICE PERIOD OF EACH AWARD. SEE NOTE 15,

INCENTIVE PROGRAM, FOR FURTHER DETAILS.

2. ACCOUNTING CHANGES

CORPORATION DID NOT ADOPT AUTHORITATIVE GUIDANCE IN 2012 THAT HAD A MATERIAL

IMPACT ON THE CORPORATION’S FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

5. CASH FLOW INFORMATION

THE

CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS PROVIDES INFORMATION ABOUT CHANGES IN CASH

AND CASH EQUIVALENTS. HIGHLY LIQUID INVESTMENTS WITH MATURITIES OF THREE MONTHS

OR LESS WHEN ACQUIRED ARE CLASSIFIED AS CASH EQUIVALENTS.

THE “NET (GAIN) ON ASSET SALES” IN NET CASH PROVIDED

BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES ON THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS INCLUDES

BEFORE-TAX GAINS FROM THE JAPAN RESTRUCTURING, THE SALE OF AN UPSTREAM PROPERTY

IN ANGOLA, EXCHANGES OF UPSTREAM  PROPERTIES, THE SALE OF U.S. SERVICE STATIONS,

AND THE SALE OF THE DOWNSTREAM AFFILIATES IN MALAYSIA AND SWITZERLAND IN 2012;

FROM THE SALE OF SOME UPSTREAM CANADIAN, U.K. AND OTHER PRODUCING PROPERTIES

AND ASSETS, AND THE SALE OF U.S. SERVICE STATIONS IN 2011; AND FROM THE SALE OF

SOME UPSTREAM GULF OF MEXICO AND OTHER PRODUCING PROPERTIES, THE SALE OF U.S.

SERVICE STATIONS AND OTHER DOWNSTREAM ASSETS AND INVESTMENTS AND THE FORMATION

OF A CHEMICAL JOINT VENTURE IN 2010. THESE GAINS ARE REPORTED IN “OTHER INCOME”

ON THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF INCOME.

IN 2012, THE CORPORATION’S INTEREST IN A COST COMPANY

WAS REDEEMED.  AS PART OF THE REDEMPTION, A VARIABLE NOTE DUE IN 2035 ISSUED BY

MOBIL SERVICES (BAHAMAS) LTD. WAS ASSIGNED TO A CONSOLIDATED EXXONMOBIL

AFFILIATE.  THIS NOTE IS NO LONGER CLASSIFIED AS THIRD PARTY LONG-TERM DEBT.

THIS ASSIGNMENT DID NOT RESULT IN A “REDUCTION IN LONG-TERM DEBT” ON THE

STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS.

IN 2012, EXXONMOBIL COMPLETED ASSET EXCHANGES,

PRIMARILY NONCASH TRANSACTIONS, OF APPROXIMATELY $1 BILLION.  THIS AMOUNT IS

NOT INCLUDED IN THE “SALES OF SUBSIDIARIES, INVESTMENTS, AND PROPERTY, PLANT

AND EQUIPMENT” OR THE “ADDITIONS TO PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT” LINES ON THE

STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS.

IN 2011, INCLUDED IN “PROCEEDS ASSOCIATED WITH SALES

OF SUBSIDIARIES, PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT, AND SALES AND RETURNS OF

INVESTMENTS” IS A $3.6 BILLION DEPOSIT FOR AN ASSET THAT WAS SOLD IN 2012.

IN 2010, THE CORPORATION ACQUIRED ALL THE OUTSTANDING

7. EQUITY COMPANY

INFORMATION

THE

SUMMARIZED FINANCIAL INFORMATION BELOW INCLUDES AMOUNTS RELATED TO CERTAIN

LESS-THAN-MAJORITY-OWNED COMPANIES AND MAJORITY-OWNED SUBSIDIARIES WHERE

MINORITY SHAREHOLDERS POSSESS THE RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN SIGNIFICANT

MANAGEMENT DECISIONS (SEE NOTE 1). THESE COMPANIES ARE PRIMARILY ENGAGED

IN CRUDE PRODUCTION, NATURAL GAS PRODUCTION, NATURAL GAS MARKETING AND REFINING

OPERATIONS IN NORTH AMERICA; NATURAL GAS PRODUCTION, NATURAL GAS DISTRIBUTION

AND DOWNSTREAM OPERATIONS IN EUROPE; REFINING OPERATIONS, PETROCHEMICAL

MANUFACTURING, FUEL SALES AND POWER GENERATION IN ASIA; CRUDE PRODUCTION IN

KAZAKHSTAN; AND LIQUEFIED NATURAL GAS (LNG) OPERATIONS IN QATAR. ALSO INCLUDED

ARE SEVERAL REFINING, PETROCHEMICAL MANUFACTURING AND CHEMICAL VENTURES.

THE CORPORATION’S OWNERSHIP IN THESE VENTURES IS IN THE FORM OF SHARES IN

CORPORATE JOINT VENTURES AS WELL AS INTERESTS IN PARTNERSHIPS.

DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE COMPANY’S CARRYING VALUE OF AN EQUITY

INVESTMENT AND ITS UNDERLYING EQUITY IN THE NET ASSETS OF THE AFFILIATE ARE

ASSIGNED TO THE EXTENT PRACTICABLE TO SPECIFIC ASSETS AND LIABILITIES BASED ON

THE COMPANY’S ANALYSIS OF THE FACTORS GIVING RISE TO THE DIFFERENCE. THE

AMORTIZATION OF THIS DIFFERENCE, AS APPROPRIATE, IS INCLUDED IN “INCOME FROM

EQUITY AFFILIATES.”

ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS

THE

CORPORATION INCURS RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS FOR CERTAIN ASSETS. THE FAIR VALUES

OF THESE OBLIGATIONS ARE RECORDED AS LIABILITIES ON A DISCOUNTED BASIS, WHICH

IS TYPICALLY AT THE TIME THE ASSETS ARE INSTALLED. IN THE ESTIMATION OF FAIR

VALUE, THE CORPORATION USES ASSUMPTIONS AND JUDGMENTS REGARDING SUCH FACTORS AS

THE EXISTENCE OF A LEGAL OBLIGATION FOR AN ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATION;

TECHNICAL ASSESSMENTS OF THE ASSETS; ESTIMATED AMOUNTS AND TIMING OF SETTLEMENTS;

DISCOUNT RATES; AND INFLATION RATES. ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS INCURRED IN

THE CURRENT PERIOD WERE LEVEL 3 (UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS) FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS.

THE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THESE LIABILITIES ARE CAPITALIZED AS PART OF THE

RELATED ASSETS AND DEPRECIATED AS THE RESERVES ARE PRODUCED. OVER TIME, THE

LIABILITIES ARE ACCRETED FOR THE CHANGE IN THEIR PRESENT VALUE.

ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS FOR DOWNSTREAM AND

CHEMICAL FACILITIES GENERALLY BECOME FIRM AT THE TIME THE FACILITIES ARE

PERMANENTLY SHUT DOWN AND DISMANTLED. THESE OBLIGATIONS MAY INCLUDE THE COSTS

OF ASSET DISPOSAL AND ADDITIONAL SOIL REMEDIATION. HOWEVER, THESE SITES HAVE

INDETERMINATE LIVES BASED ON PLANS FOR CONTINUED OPERATIONS AND AS SUCH, THE

FAIR VALUE OF THE CONDITIONAL LEGAL OBLIGATIONS CANNOT BE MEASURED, SINCE IT IS

IMPOSSIBLE TO ESTIMATE THE FUTURE SETTLEMENT DATES OF SUCH OBLIGATIONS.

SUSPENDED EXPLORATORY WELL COSTS

THE

CORPORATION CONTINUES CAPITALIZATION OF EXPLORATORY WELL COSTS WHEN THE

WELL HAS FOUND A SUFFICIENT QUANTITY OF RESERVES TO JUSTIFY ITS COMPLETION AS A

PRODUCING WELL AND THE CORPORATION IS MAKING SUFFICIENT PROGRESS ASSESSING

THE RESERVES AND THE ECONOMIC AND OPERATING VIABILITY OF THE PROJECT. THE TERM

“PROJECT” AS USED IN THIS REPORT DOES NOT NECESSARILY HAVE THE SAME MEANING AS

UNDER SEC RULE 13Q-1 RELATING TO GOVERNMENT PAYMENT REPORTING. FOR EXAMPLE, A

SINGLE PROJECT FOR PURPOSES OF THE RULE MAY ENCOMPASS NUMEROUS PROPERTIES,

AGREEMENTS, INVESTMENTS, DEVELOPMENTS, PHASES, WORK EFFORTS, ACTIVITIES, AND

COMPONENTS, EACH OF WHICH WE MAY ALSO INFORMALLY DESCRIBE AS A “PROJECT.”

DERIVATIVE

INSTRUMENTS.

THE CORPORATION’S SIZE,

STRONG CAPITAL STRUCTURE, GEOGRAPHIC DIVERSITY AND THE COMPLEMENTARY NATURE OF

THE UPSTREAM, DOWNSTREAM AND CHEMICAL BUSINESSES REDUCE THE CORPORATION’S

ENTERPRISE-WIDE RISK FROM CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES, CURRENCY RATES AND

COMMODITY PRICES. AS A RESULT, THE CORPORATION MAKES LIMITED USE OF DERIVATIVES

TO MITIGATE THE IMPACT OF SUCH CHANGES. THE CORPORATION DOES NOT ENGAGE IN

SPECULATIVE DERIVATIVE ACTIVITIES OR DERIVATIVE TRADING ACTIVITIES NOR DOES IT

USE DERIVATIVES WITH LEVERAGED FEATURES. WHEN THE CORPORATION DOES ENTER INTO

DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS, IT IS TO OFFSET EXPOSURES ASSOCIATED WITH INTEREST

RATES, FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES AND HYDROCARBON PRICES THAT ARISE FROM

EXISTING ASSETS, LIABILITIES AND FORECASTED TRANSACTIONS.

THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS

OUTSTANDING AND RECORDED ON THE BALANCE SHEET WAS A NET ASSET OF $2 MILLION AT

YEAR-END 2012 AND A NET LIABILITY OF $3 MILLION AT YEAR-END 2011. ASSETS AND

LIABILITIES ASSOCIATED WITH DERIVATIVES ARE USUALLY RECORDED EITHER IN “OTHER

CURRENT ASSETS” OR “ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND ACCRUED LIABILITIES.”

THE CORPORATION’S FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT OF ITS

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS USE EITHER LEVEL 1 (OBSERVABLE QUOTED PRICES ON ACTIVE

EXCHANGES) OR LEVEL 2 (DERIVATIVES THAT ARE DETERMINED BY EITHER MARKET PRICES

ON AN ACTIVE MARKET FOR SIMILAR ASSETS OR BY PRICES QUOTED BY A BROKER OR OTHER

MARKET-CORROBORATED PRICES) INPUTS.

THE CORPORATION RECOGNIZED A BEFORE-TAX GAIN OR (LOSS)

RELATED TO DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS OF $(23) MILLION, $131 MILLION AND $221 MILLION

DURING 2012, 2011 AND 2010, RESPECTIVELY. INCOME STATEMENT EFFECTS ASSOCIATED

WITH DERIVATIVES ARE USUALLY RECORDED EITHER IN “SALES AND OTHER OPERATING REVENUE”

OR “CRUDE OIL AND PRODUCT PURCHASES.”

THE CORPORATION BELIEVES THERE ARE NO MATERIAL MARKET

OR CREDIT RISKS TO THE CORPORATION’S FINANCIAL POSITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

OR LIQUIDITY AS A RESULT OF THE DERIVATIVE ACTIVITIES DESCRIBED ABOVE.

NOT COUNT AGAINST THIS MAXIMUM LIMIT. THE 2003 INCENTIVE PROGRAM DOES NOT HAVE

A SPECIFIED TERM. NEW AWARDS MAY BE MADE UNTIL THE AVAILABLE SHARES ARE

DEPLETED, UNLESS THE BOARD TERMINATES THE PLAN EARLY. AT THE END OF 2012,

REMAINING SHARES AVAILABLE FOR AWARD UNDER THE 2003 INCENTIVE PROGRAM WERE 124,736

THOUSAND.

RESTRICTED

STOCK.

AWARDS TOTALING 10,017 THOUSAND,

10,533 THOUSAND, AND 10,648 THOUSAND (EXCLUDING XTO MERGER-RELATED GRANTS) OF

RESTRICTED (NONVESTED) COMMON STOCK AND RESTRICTED (NONVESTED) COMMON STOCK

UNITS WERE GRANTED IN 2012, 2011 AND 2010, RESPECTIVELY. COMPENSATION EXPENSE

FOR THESE AWARDS IS BASED ON THE PRICE OF THE STOCK AT THE DATE OF GRANT AND IS

RECOGNIZED IN INCOME OVER THE REQUISITE SERVICE PERIOD. THESE SHARES ARE ISSUED

TO EMPLOYEES FROM TREASURY STOCK. THE UNITS THAT ARE SETTLED IN CASH ARE

RECORDED AS LIABILITIES AND THEIR CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE ARE RECOGNIZED OVER THE

VESTING PERIOD. DURING THE APPLICABLE RESTRICTED PERIODS, THE SHARES MAY NOT BE

SOLD OR TRANSFERRED AND ARE SUBJECT TO FORFEITURE. THE MAJORITY OF THE AWARDS

HAVE GRADED VESTING PERIODS, WITH 50 PERCENT OF THE SHARES IN EACH AWARD

VESTING AFTER THREE YEARS AND THE REMAINING 50 PERCENT VESTING AFTER SEVEN

YEARS. AWARDS GRANTED TO A SMALL NUMBER OF SENIOR EXECUTIVES HAVE VESTING

PERIODS OF FIVE YEARS FOR 50 PERCENT OF THE AWARD AND OF 10 YEARS OR

RETIREMENT, WHICHEVER OCCURS LATER, FOR THE REMAINING 50 PERCENT OF THE AWARD.

ADDITIONALLY, IN 2010 LONG-TERM INCENTIVE AWARDS

TOTALING 4,206 THOUSAND SHARES OF RESTRICTED (NONVESTED) COMMON STOCK, WITH A

VALUE OF $250 MILLION, WERE GRANTED IN ASSOCIATION WITH THE XTO MERGER. THE

MAJORITY OF THESE AWARDS VEST OVER PERIODS OF UP TO THREE YEARS AFTER THE

INITIAL GRANT.

THE CORPORATION HAS PURCHASED SHARES IN THE OPEN

MARKET AND THROUGH NEGOTIATED TRANSACTIONS TO OFFSET SHARES ISSUED IN

CONJUNCTION WITH BENEFIT PLANS AND PROGRAMS. PURCHASES MAY BE DISCONTINUED AT

ANY TIME WITHOUT PRIOR NOTICE.

STOCK OPTIONS.

THE

CORPORATION HAS NOT GRANTED ANY STOCK OPTIONS UNDER THE 2003 INCENTIVE PROGRAM

AND ALL STOCK OPTIONS GRANTED UNDER THE PRIOR PROGRAM WERE EXERCISED BY THE END

OF 2011. IN 2010, THE CORPORATION GRANTED 12,393 THOUSAND OF CONVERTED XTO

STOCK OPTIONS WITH A GRANT-DATE FAIR VALUE OF $182 MILLION AS A RESULT OF THE

XTO MERGER. THESE STOCK OPTIONS GENERALLY VEST AND BECOME EXERCISABLE RATABLY

OVER A THREE-YEAR PERIOD, AND MAY INCLUDE A PROVISION FOR ACCELERATED VESTING

WHEN THE COMMON STOCK PRICE REACHES SPECIFIED LEVELS. SOME STOCK OPTION

TRANCHES VEST ONLY WHEN THE COMMON STOCK PRICE REACHES SPECIFIED LEVELS. THERE

WERE 2,355 THOUSAND STOCK OPTIONS, WITH AN AVERAGE EXERCISE PRICE OF $78.60,

OUTSTANDING AT DECEMBER 31, 2012.

CASH RECEIVED FROM STOCK OPTION EXERCISES WAS $193

MILLION, $924 MILLION AND $1,043 MILLION FOR 2012, 2011 AND 2010, RESPECTIVELY.

THE CASH TAX BENEFIT REALIZED FOR THE OPTIONS EXERCISED WAS $54 MILLION, $221

16. LITIGATION AND OTHER

CONTINGENCIES

LITIGATION.

A VARIETY OF CLAIMS HAVE BEEN MADE

AGAINST EXXONMOBIL AND CERTAIN OF ITS CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES IN A NUMBER OF

PENDING LAWSUITS. MANAGEMENT HAS REGULAR LITIGATION REVIEWS, INCLUDING UPDATES

FROM CORPORATE AND OUTSIDE COUNSEL, TO ASSESS THE NEED FOR ACCOUNTING

RECOGNITION OR DISCLOSURE OF THESE CONTINGENCIES. THE CORPORATION ACCRUES AN

UNDISCOUNTED LIABILITY FOR THOSE CONTINGENCIES WHERE THE INCURRENCE OF A LOSS

IS PROBABLE AND THE AMOUNT CAN BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED. IF A RANGE OF AMOUNTS

CAN BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED AND NO AMOUNT WITHIN THE RANGE IS A BETTER ESTIMATE

THAN ANY OTHER AMOUNT, THEN THE MINIMUM OF THE RANGE IS ACCRUED. THE

CORPORATION DOES NOT RECORD LIABILITIES WHEN THE LIKELIHOOD THAT THE LIABILITY

HAS BEEN INCURRED IS PROBABLE BUT THE AMOUNT CANNOT BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED OR

WHEN THE LIABILITY IS BELIEVED TO BE ONLY REASONABLY POSSIBLE OR REMOTE. FOR

CONTINGENCIES WHERE AN UNFAVORABLE OUTCOME IS REASONABLY POSSIBLE AND WHICH ARE

SIGNIFICANT, THE CORPORATION DISCLOSES THE NATURE OF THE CONTINGENCY AND, WHERE

FEASIBLE, AN ESTIMATE OF THE POSSIBLE LOSS. FOR PURPOSES OF OUR CONTINGENCY

DISCLOSURES, “SIGNIFICANT” INCLUDES MATERIAL MATTERS AS WELL AS OTHER MATTERS

WHICH MANAGEMENT BELIEVES SHOULD BE DISCLOSED. EXXONMOBIL WILL CONTINUE TO

DEFEND ITSELF VIGOROUSLY IN THESE MATTERS. BASED ON A CONSIDERATION OF ALL

RELEVANT FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES, THE CORPORATION DOES NOT BELIEVE THE ULTIMATE

OUTCOME OF ANY CURRENTLY PENDING LAWSUIT AGAINST EXXONMOBIL WILL HAVE A MATERIAL

ADVERSE EFFECT UPON THE CORPORATION’S OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, OR

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS TAKEN AS A WHOLE.

ON JUNE 30, 2011, A STATE DISTRICT COURT JURY IN

BALTIMORE COUNTY, MARYLAND RETURNED A VERDICT AGAINST EXXON MOBIL CORPORATION

IN

ALLISON, ET AL V. EXXON MOBIL CORPORATION,

A CASE INVOLVING AN

ACCIDENTAL 26,000 GALLON GASOLINE LEAK AT A SUBURBAN BALTIMORE SERVICE STATION.

THE VERDICT INCLUDED APPROXIMATELY $497 MILLION IN COMPENSATORY DAMAGES AND

APPROXIMATELY $1.0 BILLION IN PUNITIVE DAMAGES IN A FINDING THAT EXXONMOBIL

FRAUDULENTLY MISLED THE PLAINTIFF-RESIDENTS ABOUT THE EVENTS LEADING UP TO THE

LEAK, THE LEAK’S DISCOVERY, AND THE NATURE AND EXTENT OF ANY GROUNDWATER

CONTAMINATION. EXXONMOBIL BELIEVES THE VERDICT IS NOT JUSTIFIED BY THE EVIDENCE

AND THAT THE AMOUNT OF THE COMPENSATORY AWARD IS GROSSLY EXCESSIVE AND THE

IMPOSITION OF PUNITIVE DAMAGES IS IMPROPER AND UNCONSTITUTIONAL. THE TRIAL

COURT DENIED A POST-TRIAL MOTION THAT EXXONMOBIL FILED TO OVERTURN THE PUNITIVE

DAMAGES VERDICT AND ENTERED A FINAL JUDGMENT IN THE AMOUNT OF $1,488 MILLION.

EXXONMOBIL APPEALED THE VERDICT AND JUDGMENT. IN A PRIOR TRIAL INVOLVING THE

SAME LEAK AND DIFFERENT PLAINTIFFS, THE JURY AWARDED COMPENSATORY DAMAGES BUT REJECTED

THE PLAINTIFFS’ PUNITIVE DAMAGE CLAIMS. THOSE PLAINTIFFS DID NOT APPEAL THE

JURY’S DENIAL OF PUNITIVE DAMAGES. ON

FEBRUARY 9, 2012, THE MARYLAND COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS REVERSED IN PART

AND AFFIRMED IN PART THE TRIAL COURT'S DECISION ON COMPENSATORY DAMAGES IN THAT

CASE. THE MARYLAND COURT OF APPEALS GRANTED WRITS OF CERTIORARI TO BOTH PARTIES

IN RESPONSE TO THEIR SEPARATE PETITIONS SEEKING REVERSALS OF PORTIONS OF THE

COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS' DECISION. THE APPEALS IN BOTH OF THESE CASES WERE

CONSOLIDATED BEFORE THE MARYLAND COURT OF APPEALS AND ARGUMENTS WERE HELD ON

NOVEMBER 5, 2012. ON FEBRUARY 26, 2013, THE MARYLAND COURT OF APPEALS ISSUED

ITS OPINION IN THE CONSOLIDATED APPEAL. THE COURT UNANIMOUSLY REVERSED THE

FRAUD AND PUNITIVE DAMAGES JUDGMENT, AND ALSO REVERSED A MAJORITY OF THE COMPENSATORY

DAMAGE CLAIMS. THE COURT REMANDED A LIMITED NUMBER OF CLAIMS RELATED TO ALLEGED

PROPERTY DAMAGE FOR A NEW TRIAL.

OTHER

CONTINGENCIES.

THE CORPORATION AND

CERTAIN OF ITS CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES WERE CONTINGENTLY LIABLE AT DECEMBER

31, 2012, FOR GUARANTEES RELATING TO NOTES, LOANS AND PERFORMANCE UNDER

CONTRACTS. WHERE GUARANTEES FOR ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION AND OTHER SIMILAR

MATTERS DO NOT INCLUDE A STATED CAP, THE AMOUNTS REFLECT MANAGEMENT’S ESTIMATE

IN

ACCORDANCE WITH A NATIONALIZATION DECREE ISSUED BY VENEZUELA’S PRESIDENT IN

FEBRUARY 2007, BY MAY 1, 2007, A SUBSIDIARY OF THE VENEZUELAN NATIONAL OIL

COMPANY (PDVSA) ASSUMED THE OPERATORSHIP OF THE CERRO NEGRO HEAVY OIL PROJECT.

THIS PROJECT HAD BEEN OPERATED AND OWNED BY EXXONMOBIL AFFILIATES HOLDING A

41.67 PERCENT OWNERSHIP INTEREST IN THE PROJECT. THE DECREE ALSO REQUIRED

CONVERSION OF THE CERRO NEGRO PROJECT INTO A “MIXED ENTERPRISE” AND AN INCREASE

IN PDVSA’S OR ONE OF ITS AFFILIATE’S OWNERSHIP INTEREST IN THE PROJECT, WITH

THE STIPULATION THAT IF EXXONMOBIL REFUSED TO ACCEPT THE TERMS FOR THE

FORMATION OF THE MIXED ENTERPRISE WITHIN A SPECIFIED PERIOD OF TIME, THE

GOVERNMENT WOULD “DIRECTLY ASSUME THE ACTIVITIES” CARRIED OUT BY THE JOINT

VENTURE. EXXONMOBIL REFUSED TO ACCEDE TO THE TERMS PROFFERED BY THE GOVERNMENT,

AND ON JUNE 27, 2007, THE GOVERNMENT EXPROPRIATED EXXONMOBIL’S 41.67 PERCENT

INTEREST IN THE CERRO NEGRO PROJECT. EXXONMOBIL’S REMAINING NET BOOK INVESTMENT

IN CERRO NEGRO PRODUCING ASSETS IS ABOUT $750 MILLION.

ON SEPTEMBER 6, 2007, AFFILIATES OF EXXONMOBIL FILED A

REQUEST FOR ARBITRATION WITH THE INTERNATIONAL CENTRE FOR SETTLEMENT OF

INVESTMENT DISPUTES (ICSID) INVOKING ICSID JURISDICTION UNDER VENEZUELA’S

INVESTMENT LAW AND THE NETHERLANDS-VENEZUELA BILATERAL INVESTMENT TREATY. THE

ICSID TRIBUNAL ISSUED A DECISION ON JUNE 10, 2010, FINDING THAT IT HAD

JURISDICTION TO PROCEED ON THE BASIS OF THE NETHERLANDS-VENEZUELA BILATERAL

INVESTMENT TREATY. THE ICSID ARBITRATION PROCEEDING IS CONTINUING AND A HEARING

ON THE MERITS WAS HELD IN FEBRUARY 2012. AT THIS TIME, THE NET IMPACT OF THESE

MATTERS ON THE CORPORATION’S CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL RESULTS CANNOT BE

REASONABLY ESTIMATED. REGARDLESS, THE CORPORATION DOES NOT EXPECT THE

RESOLUTION TO HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT UPON THE CORPORATION’S OPERATIONS OR

FINANCIAL CONDITION.

AN AFFILIATE OF EXXONMOBIL IS ONE OF THE CONTRACTORS

UNDER A PRODUCTION SHARING CONTRACT (PSC) WITH THE NIGERIAN NATIONAL PETROLEUM

CORPORATION (NNPC) COVERING THE ERHA BLOCK LOCATED IN THE OFFSHORE WATERS OF

NIGERIA. EXXONMOBIL’S AFFILIATE IS THE OPERATOR OF THE BLOCK AND OWNS A

56.25 PERCENT INTEREST UNDER THE PSC. THE CONTRACTORS ARE IN DISPUTE WITH

NNPC REGARDING NNPC’S LIFTING OF CRUDE OIL IN EXCESS OF ITS ENTITLEMENT UNDER

THE TERMS OF THE PSC. IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE TERMS OF THE PSC, THE

CONTRACTORS INITIATED ARBITRATION IN ABUJA, NIGERIA, UNDER THE NIGERIAN

ARBITRATION AND CONCILIATION ACT. ON OCTOBER 24, 2011, A THREE-MEMBER

ARBITRAL TRIBUNAL ISSUED AN AWARD UPHOLDING THE CONTRACTORS’ POSITION IN ALL

MATERIAL RESPECTS AND AWARDING DAMAGES TO THE CONTRACTORS JOINTLY IN AN AMOUNT

OF APPROXIMATELY $1.8 BILLION PLUS $234 MILLION IN ACCRUED INTEREST. THE

CONTRACTORS PETITIONED A NIGERIAN FEDERAL COURT FOR ENFORCEMENT OF THE AWARD,

AND NNPC PETITIONED THE SAME COURT TO HAVE THE AWARD SET ASIDE.

ON MAY 22, 2012, THE COURT SET ASIDE THE

AWARD.  THE CONTRACTORS HAVE APPEALED THAT JUDGMENT.

AT THIS TIME, THE NET IMPACT OF THIS MATTER ON

THE CORPORATION’S CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL RESULTS CANNOT BE REASONABLY

ESTIMATED. HOWEVER, REGARDLESS OF THE OUTCOME OF ENFORCEMENT PROCEEDINGS,

THE CORPORATION DOES NOT EXPECT THE PROCEEDINGS TO HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT UPON

THE CORPORATION’S OPERATIONS OR FINANCIAL CONDITION.

FOR

2012 AND 2011, OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS PAID ARE NET OF $23 MILLION AND $29

MILLION OF MEDICARE SUBSIDY RECEIPTS, RESPECTIVELY.

FOR

U.S. PLANS, THE DISCOUNT RATE IS DETERMINED BY CONSTRUCTING A PORTFOLIO OF

HIGH-QUALITY, NONCALLABLE BONDS WITH CASH FLOWS THAT MATCH ESTIMATED OUTFLOWS

FOR BENEFIT PAYMENTS. FOR MAJOR NON-U.S. PLANS, THE DISCOUNT RATE IS

DETERMINED BY USING BOND PORTFOLIOS WITH AN AVERAGE MATURITY APPROXIMATING THAT

OF THE LIABILITIES OR SPOT YIELD CURVES, BOTH OF WHICH ARE CONSTRUCTED

USING HIGH-QUALITY, LOCAL-CURRENCY-DENOMINATED BONDS.

THE MEASUREMENT OF THE ACCUMULATED

POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATION ASSUMES AN INITIAL HEALTH CARE COST TREND

RATE OF 5.0 PERCENT THAT DECLINES TO 4.5 PERCENT BY 2015. A

ONE-PERCENTAGE-POINT INCREASE IN THE HEALTH CARE COST TREND RATE WOULD

INCREASE SERVICE AND INTEREST COST BY $74 MILLION AND THE POSTRETIREMENT

BENEFIT OBLIGATION BY $871 MILLION. A ONE-PERCENTAGE-POINT DECREASE IN THE

HEALTH CARE COST TREND RATE WOULD DECREASE SERVICE AND INTEREST COST BY $57

MILLION AND THE POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATION BY $700 MILLION.

THE

CORPORATION’S INVESTMENT STRATEGY FOR BENEFIT PLAN ASSETS REFLECTS A LONG-TERM

VIEW, A CAREFUL ASSESSMENT OF THE RISKS INHERENT IN VARIOUS ASSET CLASSES AND

BROAD DIVERSIFICATION TO REDUCE THE RISK OF THE PORTFOLIO. THE BENEFIT PLAN

ASSETS ARE PRIMARILY INVESTED IN PASSIVE EQUITY AND FIXED INCOME INDEX

FUNDS TO DIVERSIFY RISK WHILE MINIMIZING COSTS. THE EQUITY FUNDS HOLD

EXXONMOBIL STOCK ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO REPLICATE THE RELEVANT EQUITY

INDEX. THE FIXED INCOME FUNDS ARE LARGELY INVESTED IN HIGH-QUALITY CORPORATE

AND GOVERNMENT DEBT SECURITIES.

STUDIES ARE PERIODICALLY CONDUCTED TO ESTABLISH THE

PREFERRED TARGET ASSET ALLOCATION PERCENTAGES. THE TARGET ASSET ALLOCATION FOR

THE U.S. BENEFIT PLANS IS 50 PERCENT EQUITY SECURITIES AND 50 PERCENT DEBT

SECURITIES. THE TARGET ASSET ALLOCATION FOR THE NON-U.S. PLANS IN AGGREGATE IS 50

PERCENT EQUITY SECURITIES AND 50 PERCENT DEBT SECURITIES. THE EQUITY TARGETS

FOR THE U.S. AND NON-U.S. PLANS INCLUDE AN ALLOCATION TO PRIVATE EQUITY

PARTNERSHIPS THAT PRIMARILY FOCUS ON EARLY-STAGE VENTURE CAPITAL OF 5 PERCENT

AND 3 PERCENT, RESPECTIVELY.

THE FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT LEVELS ARE ACCOUNTING TERMS

THAT REFER TO DIFFERENT METHODS OF VALUING ASSETS. THE TERMS DO NOT REPRESENT

THE RELATIVE RISK OR CREDIT QUALITY OF AN INVESTMENT.

DISCLOSURES ABOUT SEGMENTS AND RELATED INFORMATION

THE

UPSTREAM, DOWNSTREAM AND CHEMICAL FUNCTIONS BEST DEFINE THE OPERATING SEGMENTS

OF THE BUSINESS THAT ARE REPORTED SEPARATELY. THE FACTORS USED TO IDENTIFY

THESE REPORTABLE SEGMENTS ARE BASED ON THE NATURE OF THE OPERATIONS THAT ARE

UNDERTAKEN BY EACH SEGMENT. THE UPSTREAM SEGMENT IS ORGANIZED AND OPERATES TO

EXPLORE FOR AND PRODUCE CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS. THE DOWNSTREAM SEGMENT IS

ORGANIZED AND OPERATES TO MANUFACTURE AND SELL PETROLEUM PRODUCTS. THE CHEMICAL

SEGMENT IS ORGANIZED AND OPERATES TO MANUFACTURE AND SELL PETROCHEMICALS. THESE

SEGMENTS ARE BROADLY UNDERSTOOD ACROSS THE PETROLEUM AND PETROCHEMICAL

INDUSTRIES.

THESE FUNCTIONS HAVE BEEN DEFINED AS THE OPERATING

SEGMENTS OF THE CORPORATION BECAUSE THEY ARE THE SEGMENTS (1) THAT ENGAGE

IN BUSINESS ACTIVITIES FROM WHICH REVENUES ARE EARNED AND EXPENSES ARE

INCURRED; (2) WHOSE OPERATING RESULTS ARE REGULARLY REVIEWED BY THE

CORPORATION’S CHIEF OPERATING DECISION MAKER TO MAKE DECISIONS ABOUT RESOURCES

TO BE ALLOCATED TO THE SEGMENT AND ASSESS ITS PERFORMANCE; AND (3) FOR

WHICH DISCRETE FINANCIAL INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE.

EARNINGS AFTER INCOME TAX INCLUDE TRANSFERS AT

ESTIMATED MARKET PRICES.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS.

THE CORPORATION IS SUBJECT TO INCOME TAXATION IN MANY

JURISDICTIONS AROUND THE WORLD. UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS REFLECT THE

DIFFERENCE BETWEEN POSITIONS TAKEN OR EXPECTED TO BE TAKEN ON INCOME TAX

RETURNS AND THE AMOUNTS RECOGNIZED IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. RESOLUTION OF

THE RELATED TAX POSITIONS THROUGH NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE RELEVANT TAX

AUTHORITIES OR THROUGH LITIGATION WILL TAKE MANY YEARS TO COMPLETE. IT IS

DIFFICULT TO PREDICT THE TIMING OF RESOLUTION FOR TAX POSITIONS SINCE SUCH

TIMING IS NOT ENTIRELY WITHIN THE CONTROL OF THE CORPORATION. IT IS REASONABLY

POSSIBLE THAT THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS COULD INCREASE BY UP

TO 25 PERCENT IN THE NEXT 12 MONTHS, WITH NO MATERIAL IMPACT ON NEAR-TERM

EARNINGS. GIVEN THE LONG TIME PERIODS INVOLVED IN RESOLVING TAX POSITIONS, THE

CORPORATION DOES NOT EXPECT THAT THE RECOGNITION OF UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS

WILL HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE CORPORATION’S EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE IN

ANY GIVEN YEAR.

RESTRUCTURING

ON JUNE 1, 2012, THE CORPORATION

COMPLETED THE RESTRUCTURING OF ITS DOWNSTREAM AND CHEMICAL HOLDINGS IN

JAPAN. UNDER THE RESTRUCTURING, TONENGENERAL

SEKIYU K. K. (TG), A CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARY OWNED 50 PERCENT BY

THE CORPORATION, PURCHASED FOR $3.9 BILLION THE CORPORATION’S SHARES OF A

WHOLLY-OWNED AFFILIATE IN JAPAN, EMG MARKETING GODO KAISHA (PREVIOUSLY KNOWN AS

EXXONMOBIL YUGEN KAISHA), WHICH RESULTED IN TG ACQUIRING APPROXIMATELY 200 MILLION

OF ITS SHARES OWNED BY THE CORPORATION ALONG WITH OTHER ASSETS. AS A RESULT OF

THE RESTRUCTURING, THE CORPORATION’S EFFECTIVE OWNERSHIP OF TG WAS REDUCED TO

APPROXIMATELY 22 PERCENT AND A NET GAIN OF $6.5 BILLION WAS RECOGNIZED.

THE GAIN IS INCLUDED IN “OTHER INCOME” PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AMOUNTS INCLUDED IN

“INCOME TAXES” AND “NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS.”

THE GAIN INCLUDES

$1.9 BILLION OF THE CORPORATION’S SHARE OF OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME RECYCLED

INTO EARNINGS (SEE NOTE 1 BELOW).  THE GAIN ALSO INCLUDES REMEASUREMENT OF TG’S

SHARES THAT THE CORPORATION CONTINUES TO OWN TO $0.7 BILLION, BASED ON TG’S

SHARE PRICE ON THE TOKYO STOCK EXCHANGE.  THE CORPORATION ACCOUNTS FOR ITS

THE AMOUNTS SHOWN FOR NET CAPITALIZED COSTS OF CONSOLIDATED

SUBSIDIARIES ARE $10,643 MILLION LESS AT YEAR-END 2012 AND $6,651 MILLION LESS

AT YEAR-END 2011 THAN THE AMOUNTS REPORTED AS INVESTMENTS IN PROPERTY, PLANT

AND EQUIPMENT FOR THE UPSTREAM IN NOTE 9. THIS IS DUE TO THE EXCLUSION

FROM CAPITALIZED COSTS OF CERTAIN TRANSPORTATION AND RESEARCH ASSETS AND ASSETS

RELATING TO LNG OPERATIONS. ASSETS RELATED TO OIL SANDS AND OIL SHALE

MINING OPERATIONS HAVE BEEN INCLUDED IN THE CAPITALIZED COSTS FOR 2012 AND 2011

IN ACCORDANCE WITH FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD RULES.

THE

AMOUNTS REPORTED AS COSTS INCURRED INCLUDE BOTH CAPITALIZED COSTS AND COSTS CHARGED

TO EXPENSE DURING THE YEAR. COSTS INCURRED ALSO INCLUDE NEW ASSET RETIREMENT

OBLIGATIONS ESTABLISHED IN THE CURRENT YEAR, AS WELL AS INCREASES OR DECREASES

TO THE ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATION RESULTING FROM CHANGES IN COST ESTIMATES OR

ABANDONMENT DATE. TOTAL CONSOLIDATED COSTS INCURRED IN 2012 WERE $31,146

MILLION, UP $392 MILLION FROM 2011, DUE PRIMARILY TO HIGHER EXPLORATION AND

DEVELOPMENT COSTS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER PROPERTY ACQUISITION COSTS. 2011

COSTS WERE $30,754 MILLION, DOWN $40,058 MILLION FROM 2010, DUE PRIMARILY TO

THE ABSENCE OF THE ACQUISITION OF XTO ENERGY INC. TOTAL EQUITY COMPANY COSTS

INCURRED IN 2012 WERE $1,404 MILLION, UP $178 MILLION FROM 2011, DUE PRIMARILY

TO HIGHER DEVELOPMENT COSTS.

OIL AND GAS RESERVES

THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION DESCRIBES CHANGES DURING THE

YEARS AND BALANCES OF PROVED OIL AND GAS RESERVES AT YEAR-END 2010, 2011, AND

2012.

THE DEFINITIONS USED ARE IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION’S RULE 4-10 (A) OF REGULATION S-X.

PROVED OIL AND GAS RESERVES ARE THOSE QUANTITIES OF

OIL AND GAS, WHICH, BY ANALYSIS OF GEOSCIENCE AND ENGINEERING DATA, CAN BE

ESTIMATED WITH REASONABLE CERTAINTY TO BE ECONOMICALLY PRODUCIBLE – FROM A

GIVEN DATE FORWARD, FROM KNOWN RESERVOIRS, AND UNDER EXISTING ECONOMIC

CONDITIONS, OPERATING METHODS AND GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS – PRIOR TO THE TIME AT

WHICH CONTRACTS PROVIDING THE RIGHT TO OPERATE EXPIRE, UNLESS EVIDENCE

INDICATES THAT RENEWAL IS REASONABLY CERTAIN. IN SOME CASES, SUBSTANTIAL NEW INVESTMENTS

IN ADDITIONAL WELLS AND RELATED FACILITIES WILL BE REQUIRED TO RECOVER THESE

PROVED RESERVES.

IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE

COMMISSION’S RULES, THE YEAR-END RESERVES VOLUMES AS WELL AS THE RESERVES

CHANGE CATEGORIES SHOWN IN THE FOLLOWING TABLES WERE CALCULATED USING AVERAGE

PRICES DURING THE 12-MONTH PERIOD PRIOR TO THE ENDING DATE OF THE PERIOD

COVERED BY THE REPORT, DETERMINED AS AN UNWEIGHTED ARITHMETIC AVERAGE OF THE

FIRST-DAY-OF-THE-MONTH PRICE FOR EACH MONTH WITHIN SUCH PERIOD. THESE RESERVES

QUANTITIES ARE ALSO USED IN CALCULATING UNIT-OF-PRODUCTION DEPRECIATION RATES

AND IN CALCULATING THE STANDARDIZED MEASURE OF DISCOUNTED NET CASH FLOW.

REVISIONS CAN INCLUDE UPWARD OR DOWNWARD CHANGES IN

PREVIOUSLY ESTIMATED VOLUMES OF PROVED RESERVES FOR EXISTING FIELDS DUE TO THE

EVALUATION OR RE-EVALUATION OF (1) ALREADY AVAILABLE GEOLOGIC, RESERVOIR

OR PRODUCTION DATA, (2) NEW GEOLOGIC, RESERVOIR OR PRODUCTION DATA OR

(3) CHANGES IN AVERAGE PRICES AND YEAR-END COSTS THAT ARE USED IN THE

ESTIMATION OF RESERVES. THIS CATEGORY CAN ALSO INCLUDE SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN

EITHER DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY OR PRODUCTION EQUIPMENT/FACILITY CAPACITY.

PROVED RESERVES INCLUDE 100 PERCENT OF EACH

MAJORITY-OWNED AFFILIATE’S PARTICIPATION IN PROVED RESERVES AND EXXONMOBIL’S

OWNERSHIP PERCENTAGE OF THE PROVED RESERVES OF EQUITY COMPANIES, BUT EXCLUDE

ROYALTIES AND QUANTITIES DUE OTHERS. GAS RESERVES EXCLUDE THE GASEOUS

EQUIVALENT OF LIQUIDS EXPECTED TO BE REMOVED FROM THE GAS ON LEASES, AT FIELD

FACILITIES AND AT GAS PROCESSING PLANTS. THESE LIQUIDS ARE INCLUDED IN NET

PROVED RESERVES OF CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS LIQUIDS.

IN THE PROVED RESERVES TABLES, CONSOLIDATED RESERVES

AND EQUITY COMPANY RESERVES ARE REPORTED SEPARATELY. HOWEVER, THE CORPORATION

DOES NOT VIEW EQUITY COMPANY RESERVES ANY DIFFERENTLY THAN THOSE FROM

CONSOLIDATED COMPANIES.

RESERVES REPORTED UNDER PRODUCTION SHARING AND OTHER

NONCONCESSIONARY AGREEMENTS ARE BASED ON THE ECONOMIC INTEREST AS DEFINED BY

THE SPECIFIC FISCAL TERMS IN THE AGREEMENT. THE PRODUCTION AND RESERVES THAT WE

REPORT FOR THESE TYPES OF ARRANGEMENTS TYPICALLY VARY INVERSELY WITH OIL AND

GAS PRICE CHANGES. AS OIL AND GAS PRICES INCREASE, THE CASH FLOW AND VALUE

RECEIVED BY THE COMPANY INCREASE; HOWEVER, THE PRODUCTION VOLUMES AND RESERVES

REQUIRED TO ACHIEVE THIS VALUE WILL TYPICALLY BE LOWER BECAUSE OF THE HIGHER

PRICES. WHEN PRICES DECREASE, THE OPPOSITE EFFECT GENERALLY OCCURS. THE

PERCENTAGE OF TOTAL LIQUIDS AND NATURAL GAS PROVED RESERVES (CONSOLIDATED

SUBSIDIARIES PLUS EQUITY COMPANIES) AT YEAR-END 2012 THAT WERE ASSOCIATED WITH

PRODUCTION SHARING CONTRACT ARRANGEMENTS WAS 12 PERCENT OF LIQUIDS, 8 PERCENT

OF NATURAL GAS AND 10 PERCENT ON AN OIL-EQUIVALENT BASIS (GAS CONVERTED TO

OIL-EQUIVALENT AT 6 BILLION CUBIC FEET = 1 MILLION BARRELS).

NET PROVED DEVELOPED RESERVES ARE THOSE VOLUMES THAT

ARE EXPECTED TO BE RECOVERED THROUGH EXISTING WELLS WITH EXISTING EQUIPMENT AND

OPERATING METHODS OR IN WHICH THE COST OF THE REQUIRED EQUIPMENT IS RELATIVELY

MINOR COMPARED TO THE COST OF A NEW WELL. NET PROVED UNDEVELOPED RESERVES ARE

THOSE VOLUMES THAT ARE EXPECTED TO BE RECOVERED FROM NEW WELLS ON UNDRILLED

ACREAGE, OR FROM EXISTING WELLS WHERE A RELATIVELY MAJOR EXPENDITURE IS

REQUIRED FOR RECOMPLETION.

CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS LIQUIDS AND NATURAL GAS

PRODUCTION QUANTITIES SHOWN ARE THE NET VOLUMES WITHDRAWN FROM EXXONMOBIL’S OIL

AND GAS RESERVES. THE NATURAL GAS QUANTITIES DIFFER FROM THE QUANTITIES OF GAS

DELIVERED FOR SALE BY THE PRODUCING FUNCTION AS REPORTED IN THE OPERATING

SUMMARY DUE TO VOLUMES CONSUMED OR FLARED AND INVENTORY CHANGES.

IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE

COMMISSION’S RULES, BITUMEN EXTRACTED THROUGH MINING ACTIVITIES AND

HYDROCARBONS FROM OTHER NON-TRADITIONAL RESOURCES ARE REPORTED AS OIL AND GAS

RESERVES BEGINNING IN 2009.

THE RULES IN 2009 ADOPTED A RELIABLE TECHNOLOGY

DEFINITION THAT PERMITS RESERVES TO BE ADDED BASED ON TECHNOLOGIES THAT HAVE

BEEN FIELD TESTED AND HAVE BEEN DEMONSTRATED TO PROVIDE REASONABLY CERTAIN

RESULTS WITH CONSISTENCY AND REPEATABILITY IN THE FORMATION BEING EVALUATED.

THE CHANGES BETWEEN 2011 YEAR-END PROVED RESERVES AND

2012 YEAR-END PROVED RESERVES REFLECT THE EXTENSIONS AND DISCOVERIES IN NORTH

AMERICA.

STANDARDIZED MEASURE OF DISCOUNTED

FUTURE CASH FLOWS

AS REQUIRED BY THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING

STANDARDS BOARD, THE STANDARDIZED MEASURE OF DISCOUNTED FUTURE NET CASH FLOWS

IS COMPUTED BY APPLYING FIRST-DAY-OF-THE-MONTH AVERAGE PRICES,

YEAR-END COSTS AND LEGISLATED TAX RATES AND A DISCOUNT FACTOR OF 10

PERCENT TO NET PROVED RESERVES. THE STANDARDIZED MEASURE INCLUDES COSTS

FOR FUTURE DISMANTLEMENT, ABANDONMENT AND REHABILITATION OBLIGATIONS.

THE CORPORATION BELIEVES THE STANDARDIZED MEASURE DOES NOT PROVIDE

A RELIABLE ESTIMATE OF THE CORPORATION’S EXPECTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS TO BE

OBTAINED FROM THE DEVELOPMENT AND PRODUCTION OF ITS OIL AND GAS PROPERTIES OR

OF THE VALUE OF ITS PROVED OIL AND GAS RESERVES. THE STANDARDIZED MEASURE IS

PREPARED ON THE BASIS OF CERTAIN PRESCRIBED ASSUMPTIONS INCLUDING

FIRST-DAY-OF-THE-MONTH AVERAGE PRICES, WHICH REPRESENT DISCRETE POINTS IN TIME

AND THEREFORE MAY CAUSE SIGNIFICANT VARIABILITY IN CASH FLOWS FROM YEAR TO YEAR

AS PRICES CHANGE.
