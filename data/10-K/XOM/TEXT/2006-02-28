ITEM 1.

BUSINESS.

EXXON MOBIL CORPORATION, FORMERLY NAMED EXXON CORPORATION, WAS INCORPORATED IN THE STATE OF NEW JERSEY IN 1882. ON NOVEMBER 30, 1999, MOBIL CORPORATION BECAME A WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARY OF EXXON CORPORATION, AND EXXON CHANGED ITS NAME TO

EXXON MOBIL CORPORATION.

DIVISIONS AND AFFILIATED COMPANIES OF

EXXONMOBIL OPERATE OR MARKET PRODUCTS IN THE UNITED STATES AND ABOUT 200 OTHER COUNTRIES AND TERRITORIES. THEIR PRINCIPAL BUSINESS IS ENERGY, INVOLVING EXPLORATION FOR, AND PRODUCTION OF, CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS, MANUFACTURE OF PETROLEUM PRODUCTS

AND TRANSPORTATION AND SALE OF CRUDE OIL, NATURAL GAS AND PETROLEUM PRODUCTS. EXXONMOBIL IS A MAJOR MANUFACTURER AND MARKETER OF COMMODITY PETROCHEMICALS, INCLUDING OLEFINS, AROMATICS, POLYETHYLENE AND POLYPROPYLENE PLASTICS AND A WIDE VARIETY OF

SPECIALTY PRODUCTS. EXXONMOBIL ALSO HAS INTERESTS IN ELECTRIC POWER GENERATION FACILITIES. AFFILIATES OF EXXONMOBIL CONDUCT EXTENSIVE RESEARCH PROGRAMS IN SUPPORT OF THESE BUSINESSES.

EXXON MOBIL CORPORATION HAS SEVERAL DIVISIONS AND HUNDREDS OF AFFILIATES, MANY WITH NAMES THAT INCLUDE

EXXONMOBIL, EXXON,

ESSO

OR

MOBIL

. FOR CONVENIENCE AND SIMPLICITY, IN THIS REPORT THE TERMS

EXXONMOBIL, EXXON, ESSO

AND

MOBIL

, AS WELL AS TERMS LIKE

CORPORATION, COMPANY, OUR, WE

AND

ITS

, ARE SOMETIMES USED AS ABBREVIATED

REFERENCES TO SPECIFIC AFFILIATES OR GROUPS OF AFFILIATES. THE PRECISE MEANING DEPENDS ON THE CONTEXT IN QUESTION.

THROUGHOUT EXXONMOBILS BUSINESSES, NEW AND ONGOING MEASURES ARE TAKEN TO PREVENT AND MINIMIZE THE IMPACT OF OUR OPERATIONS ON THE AIR, WATER AND

GROUND. THIS INCLUDES A SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT IN REFINING TECHNOLOGY TO MANUFACTURE LOW-SULFUR MOTOR FUELS AS WELL AS PROJECTS TO REDUCE NITROGEN OXIDE AND SULFUR OXIDE EMISSIONS. EXXONMOBILS 2005 WORLDWIDE ENVIRONMENTAL COSTS FOR ALL SUCH

PREVENTATIVE AND REMEDIATION STEPS WERE ABOUT $3.3 BILLION, OF WHICH $1.2 BILLION WERE CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND $2.1 BILLION WERE INCLUDED IN EXPENSES. THE TOTAL COST FOR SUCH ACTIVITIES IS EXPECTED TO REMAIN IN THIS RANGE IN 2006 AND 2007

(WITH CAPITAL EXPENDITURES APPROXIMATELY 35 PERCENT OF THE TOTAL).

OPERATING DATA AND INDUSTRY SEGMENT INFORMATION FOR THE CORPORATION ARE CONTAINED ON PAGES 30, 73, 74 AND 86; INFORMATION ON OIL AND GAS RESERVES IS CONTAINED ON PAGES 80 THROUGH 83 AND INFORMATION ON COMPANY-SPONSORED RESEARCH AND

DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES IS CONTAINED ON PAGE 58 OF THE FINANCIAL SECTION OF THIS REPORT.

THE NUMBER OF REGULAR EMPLOYEES WAS 83.7 THOUSAND, 85.9 THOUSAND AND 88.3 THOUSAND AT YEARS ENDED 2005, 2004 AND 2003, RESPECTIVELY. REGULAR EMPLOYEES ARE DEFINED AS ACTIVE EXECUTIVE, MANAGEMENT,

PROFESSIONAL, TECHNICAL AND WAGE EMPLOYEES WHO WORK FULL TIME OR PART TIME FOR THE CORPORATION AND ARE COVERED BY THE CORPORATIONS BENEFIT PLANS AND PROGRAMS. REGULAR EMPLOYEES DO NOT INCLUDE EMPLOYEES OF THE COMPANY-OPERATED RETAIL SITES

(CORS). THE NUMBER OF CORS EMPLOYEES WAS 22.4 THOUSAND, 19.3 THOUSAND AND 17.4 THOUSAND AT YEARS ENDED 2005, 2004 AND 2003, RESPECTIVELY.

EXXONMOBIL MAINTAINS A WEBSITE AT WWW.EXXONMOBIL.COM. OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K, QUARTERLY REPORTS ON FORM 10-Q, CURRENT REPORTS ON FORM

8-K AND ANY AMENDMENTS TO THOSE REPORTS FILED OR FURNISHED PURSUANT TO SECTION 13(A) OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934 ARE MADE AVAILABLE THROUGH OUR WEBSITE AS SOON AS REASONABLY PRACTICAL AFTER WE ELECTRONICALLY FILE OR FURNISH THE REPORTS TO

THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION. ALSO AVAILABLE ON THE CORPORATIONS WEBSITE ARE THE COMPANYS CORPORATE GOVERNANCE GUIDELINES AND CODE OF ETHICS AND BUSINESS CONDUCT, AS WELL AS THE CHARTERS OF THE AUDIT, COMPENSATION AND

NOMINATING COMMITTEES OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS. ALL OF THESE DOCUMENTS ARE AVAILABLE IN PRINT WITHOUT CHARGE TO SHAREHOLDERS WHO REQUEST THEM. INFORMATION ON OUR WEBSITE IS NOT INCORPORATED INTO THIS REPORT.

INDEX TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

ITEM 1A.

RISK FACTORS.

EXXONMOBILS FINANCIAL AND OPERATING RESULTS ARE SUBJECT TO A NUMBER OF FACTORS, MANY OF WHICH ARE NOT WITHIN THE COMPANYS CONTROL. THESE

FACTORS INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING.

INDUSTRY AND ECONOMIC

FACTORS.

THE OIL AND GAS BUSINESS IS FUNDAMENTALLY A COMMODITY BUSINESS. THIS MEANS THE OPERATIONS AND EARNINGS OF THE CORPORATION AND ITS AFFILIATES THROUGHOUT THE WORLD MAY BE SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTED BY CHANGES IN OIL,

GAS AND PETROCHEMICAL PRICES AND BY CHANGES IN MARGINS ON GASOLINE AND OTHER REFINED PRODUCTS. OIL, GAS, PETROCHEMICAL AND PRODUCT PRICES AND MARGINS IN TURN DEPEND ON LOCAL, REGIONAL AND GLOBAL EVENTS OR CONDITIONS THAT AFFECT SUPPLY AND DEMAND FOR

THE RELEVANT COMMODITY. THESE EVENTS OR CONDITIONS ARE GENERALLY NOT PREDICTABLE AND INCLUDE, AMONG OTHER THINGS.



GENERAL ECONOMIC GROWTH RATES AND THE OCCURRENCE OF ECONOMIC RECESSIONS;



THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW SUPPLY SOURCES;



ADHERENCE BY COUNTRIES TO OPEC QUOTAS;



SUPPLY DISRUPTIONS;



WEATHER, INCLUDING SEASONAL PATTERNS THAT AFFECT REGIONAL ENERGY DEMAND (SUCH AS THE DEMAND FOR HEATING OIL OR GAS IN WINTER) AS WELL AS SEVERE WEATHER EVENTS (SUCH AS HURRICANES)

THAT CAN DISRUPT SUPPLIES OR INTERRUPT THE OPERATION OF EXXONMOBIL FACILITIES;



TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES, INCLUDING ADVANCES IN EXPLORATION, PRODUCTION, REFINING AND PETROCHEMICAL MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY AND ADVANCES IN TECHNOLOGY RELATING TO ENERGY USAGE;



CHANGES IN DEMOGRAPHICS, INCLUDING POPULATION GROWTH RATES AND CONSUMER PREFERENCES; AND



THE COMPETITIVENESS OF ALTERNATIVE HYDROCARBON OR OTHER ENERGY SOURCES.

UNDER CERTAIN MARKET CONDITIONS, FACTORS THAT HAVE A POSITIVE IMPACT ON ONE SEGMENT OF OUR BUSINESS MAY HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON ANOTHER SEGMENT AND VICE VERSA.

COMPETITIVE FACTORS.

THE ENERGY

AND PETROCHEMICAL INDUSTRIES ARE HIGHLY COMPETITIVE. THERE IS COMPETITION WITHIN THE INDUSTRIES AND ALSO WITH OTHER INDUSTRIES IN SUPPLYING THE ENERGY, FUEL AND CHEMICAL NEEDS OF BOTH INDUSTRIAL AND INDIVIDUAL CONSUMERS. THE CORPORATION COMPETES

WITH OTHER FIRMS IN THE SALE OR PURCHASE OF NEEDED GOODS AND SERVICES IN MANY NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL MARKETS AND EMPLOYS ALL METHODS OF COMPETITION WHICH ARE LAWFUL AND APPROPRIATE FOR SUCH PURPOSES.

A KEY COMPONENT OF THE CORPORATIONS COMPETITIVE POSITION, PARTICULARLY

GIVEN THE COMMODITY-BASED NATURE OF MANY OF ITS BUSINESSES, IS EXXONMOBILS ABILITY TO MANAGE EXPENSES SUCCESSFULLY. THIS REQUIRES CONTINUOUS MANAGEMENT FOCUS ON REDUCING UNIT COSTS AND IMPROVING EFFICIENCY INCLUDING THROUGH TECHNOLOGY

IMPROVEMENTS, COST CONTROL, PRODUCTIVITY ENHANCEMENTS AND REGULAR REAPPRAISAL OF OUR ASSET PORTFOLIO AS DESCRIBED ELSEWHERE IN THIS REPORT.

POLITICAL FACTORS.

THE OPERATIONS AND EARNINGS OF THE CORPORATION AND ITS AFFILIATES THROUGHOUT THE WORLD HAVE BEEN, AND MAY

IN THE FUTURE BE, AFFECTED FROM TIME TO TIME IN VARYING DEGREE BY POLITICAL FACTORS INCLUDING.



POLITICAL INSTABILITY OR LACK OF WELL-ESTABLISHED AND RELIABLE LEGAL SYSTEMS IN AREAS WHERE THE CORPORATION OPERATES;



OTHER POLITICAL DEVELOPMENTS AND LAWS AND REGULATIONS (SUCH AS EXPROPRIATION OR FORCED DIVESTITURE OF ASSETS AND UNILATERAL CANCELLATION OR MODIFICATION OF CONTRACT TERMS, AS WELL

AS DE-REGULATION OF CERTAIN ENERGY MARKETS);



ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS;

2

TABLE OF CONTENTS

INDEX TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS



RESTRICTIONS ON EXPLORATION, PRODUCTION, IMPORTS AND EXPORTS;



RESTRICTIONS ON THE CORPORATIONS ABILITY TO DO BUSINESS WITH CERTAIN COUNTRIES, OR TO ENGAGE IN CERTAIN AREAS OF BUSINESS WITHIN A COUNTRY;



PRICE CONTROLS;



TAX OR ROYALTY INCREASES (INCLUDING RETROACTIVE CLAIMS);



WAR OR OTHER INTERNATIONAL CONFLICTS; AND



CIVIL UNREST.

BOTH THE LIKELIHOOD OF THESE OCCURRENCES AND THEIR OVERALL EFFECT UPON THE CORPORATION VARY GREATLY FROM COUNTRY TO COUNTRY AND ARE NOT PREDICTABLE. A KEY COMPONENT OF THE CORPORATIONS STRATEGY FOR MANAGING

POLITICAL RISK IS GEOGRAPHIC DIVERSIFICATION OF THE CORPORATIONS ASSETS AND OPERATIONS.

PROJECT FACTORS.

IN ADDITION TO SOME OF THE FACTORS CITED ABOVE, EXXONMOBILS RESULTS DEPEND UPON THE CORPORATIONS ABILITY TO DEVELOP AND OPERATE MAJOR PROJECTS AND FACILITIES

AS PLANNED. THE CORPORATIONS RESULTS WILL THEREFORE BE AFFECTED BY EVENTS OR CONDITIONS THAT IMPACT THE ADVANCEMENT, OPERATION, COST OR RESULTS OF SUCH PROJECTS OR FACILITIES, INCLUDING.



THE OUTCOME OF NEGOTIATIONS WITH CO-VENTURERS, GOVERNMENTS, SUPPLIERS, CUSTOMERS OR OTHERS (INCLUDING, FOR EXAMPLE, OUR ABILITY TO NEGOTIATE FAVORABLE LONG-TERM CONTRACTS WITH

CUSTOMERS, OR THE DEVELOPMENT OF RELIABLE SPOT MARKETS, THAT MAY BE NECESSARY TO SUPPORT THE DEVELOPMENT OF PARTICULAR PRODUCTION PROJECTS);



RESERVOIR PERFORMANCE AND NATURAL FIELD DECLINE;



CHANGES IN OPERATING CONDITIONS AND COSTS, INCLUDING COSTS OF THIRD PARTY EQUIPMENT OR SERVICES SUCH AS DRILLING RIGS AND SHIPPING;



SECURITY CONCERNS OR ACTS OF TERRORISM THAT THREATEN OR DISRUPT THE SAFE OPERATION OF COMPANY FACILITIES; AND



THE OCCURRENCE OF UNFORESEEN TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES (INCLUDING TECHNICAL PROBLEMS THAT MAY DELAY START-UP OR INTERRUPT PRODUCTION FROM AN UPSTREAM PROJECT OR THAT MAY LEAD TO

UNEXPECTED DOWNTIME OF REFINERIES OR PETROCHEMICAL PLANTS).

TABLE OF CONTENTS

INDEX TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

IN THE PRECEDING RESERVES INFORMATION, AND IN THE RESERVES TABLES ON PAGES 80 THROUGH 83 OF THE FINANCIAL

SECTION OF THIS REPORT, CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARY AND EQUITY COMPANY RESERVES ARE REPORTED SEPARATELY. HOWEVER, THE CORPORATION OPERATES ITS BUSINESS WITH THE SAME VIEWS OF EQUITY COMPANY RESERVES AS IT HAS FOR RESERVES FROM CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES.

THE CORPORATIONS OVERALL VOLUME CAPACITY OUTLOOK, BASED

ON PROJECTS COMING ON STREAM AS ANTICIPATED, IS FOR PRODUCTION CAPACITY TO GROW OVER THE PERIOD 2006-2010. HOWEVER, ACTUAL VOLUMES WILL VARY FROM YEAR TO YEAR DUE TO THE TIMING OF INDIVIDUAL PROJECT START-UPS, OPERATIONAL OUTAGES, RESERVOIR

PERFORMANCE, REGULATORY CHANGES, ASSET SALES, SEVERE WEATHER EVENTS, PRICE EFFECTS ON PRODUCTION SHARING CONTRACTS AND OTHER FACTORS AS DESCRIBED IN ITEM 1ARISK FACTORS OF THIS REPORT.

THE ESTIMATION OF PROVED RESERVES, WHICH IS BASED ON THE REQUIREMENT OF

REASONABLE CERTAINTY, IS AN ONGOING PROCESS BASED ON RIGOROUS TECHNICAL EVALUATIONS, COMMERCIAL AND MARKET ASSESSMENTS AND DETAILED ANALYSIS OF WELL INFORMATION SUCH AS FLOW RATES AND RESERVOIR PRESSURE DECLINES. FURTHERMORE, THE CORPORATION ONLY

RECORDS PROVED RESERVES FOR PROJECTS WHICH HAVE RECEIVED SIGNIFICANT FUNDING COMMITMENTS BY MANAGEMENT MADE TOWARD THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE RESERVES. ALTHOUGH THE CORPORATION IS REASONABLY CERTAIN THAT PROVED RESERVES WILL BE PRODUCED, THE TIMING AND

ULTIMATE RECOVERY CAN BE AFFECTED BY A NUMBER OF FACTORS INCLUDING COMPLETION OF DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS, RESERVOIR PERFORMANCE, REGULATORY APPROVALS AND SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN PROJECTIONS OF LONG TERM OIL AND GAS PRICE LEVELS.

2.    ESTIMATES OF TOTAL NET PROVED OIL AND GAS RESERVES FILED WITH

OTHER FEDERAL AGENCIES

DURING 2005, EXXONMOBIL FILED

PROVED RESERVES ESTIMATES WITH THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY ON FORMS EIA-23 AND EIA-28. THE INFORMATION ON FORM EIA-28 IS PRESENTED ON THE SAME BASIS AS THE REGISTRANTS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR 2004, WHICH SHOWS EXXONMOBILS NET

INTERESTS IN ALL LIQUIDS AND GAS RESERVE VOLUMES AND CHANGES THERETO FROM BOTH EXXONMOBIL-OPERATED PROPERTIES AND PROPERTIES OPERATED BY OTHERS. THE DATA ON FORM EIA-23, ALTHOUGH CONSISTENT WITH THE DATA ON FORM EIA-28, IS PRESENTED ON A

DIFFERENT BASIS, AND INCLUDES 100 PERCENT OF THE OIL AND GAS VOLUMES FROM EXXONMOBIL-OPERATED PROPERTIES ONLY, REGARDLESS OF THE COMPANYS NET INTEREST. IN ADDITION, FORM EIA-23 INFORMATION DOES NOT INCLUDE GAS PLANT LIQUIDS. THE

DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE OIL RESERVES AND GAS RESERVES REPORTED ON EIA-23 AND THOSE REPORTED IN THE REGISTRANTS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR 2004 EXCEEDS FIVE PERCENT.

3.    AVERAGE SALES PRICES AND PRODUCTION COSTS PER UNIT OF PRODUCTION

REFERENCE IS MADE TO PAGES 76 AND 77 OF THE FINANCIAL SECTION OF THIS

REPORT. AVERAGE SALES PRICES HAVE BEEN CALCULATED BY USING SALES QUANTITIES FROM THE CORPORATIONS OWN PRODUCTION AS THE DIVISOR. AVERAGE PRODUCTION COSTS HAVE BEEN COMPUTED BY USING NET PRODUCTION QUANTITIES FOR THE DIVISOR. THE VOLUMES OF

CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS LIQUIDS (NGL) PRODUCTION USED FOR THIS COMPUTATION ARE SHOWN IN THE RESERVES TABLE ON PAGE 81 OF THE FINANCIAL SECTION OF THIS REPORT. THE VOLUMES OF NATURAL GAS USED IN THE CALCULATION ARE THE PRODUCTION VOLUMES OF

NATURAL GAS AVAILABLE FOR SALE AND THUS ARE DIFFERENT FROM THOSE SHOWN IN THE RESERVES TABLE ON PAGE 82 OF THE FINANCIAL SECTION OF THIS REPORT DUE TO VOLUMES CONSUMED OR FLARED. THE VOLUMES OF NATURAL GAS WERE CONVERTED TO OIL-EQUIVALENT BARRELS

BASED ON A CONVERSION FACTOR OF SIX THOUSAND CUBIC FEET PER BARREL.

EXXONMOBILS INVESTMENT IN DEVELOPED AND UNDEVELOPED ACREAGE IS COMPRISED OF NUMEROUS CONCESSIONS, BLOCKS AND LEASES. THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH THE CORPORATION MAINTAINS

EXPLORATION AND/OR PRODUCTION RIGHTS TO THE ACREAGE ARE PROPERTY-SPECIFIC, CONTRACTUALLY DEFINED AND VARY SIGNIFICANTLY FROM PROPERTY TO PROPERTY. WORK PROGRAMS ARE DESIGNED TO ENSURE THAT THE EXPLORATION POTENTIAL OF ANY PROPERTY IS FULLY EVALUATED

BEFORE EXPIRATION. IN SOME INSTANCES, THE CORPORATION MAY ELECT TO RELINQUISH ACREAGE IN ADVANCE OF THE CONTRACTUAL EXPIRATION DATE IF THE EVALUATION PROCESS IS COMPLETE AND THERE IS NOT A BUSINESS BASIS FOR EXTENSION. IN CASES WHERE ADDITIONAL TIME

MAY BE REQUIRED TO FULLY EVALUATE ACREAGE, THE CORPORATION HAS GENERALLY BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN OBTAINING EXTENSIONS.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

INDEX TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

7.     SUMMARY OF ACREAGE TERMS IN KEY AREAS

UNITED STATES

OIL AND GAS LEASES HAVE AN EXPLORATION PERIOD RANGING FROM ONE TO TEN YEARS, AND A PRODUCTION PERIOD THAT NORMALLY REMAINS

IN EFFECT UNTIL PRODUCTION CEASES. IN SOME INSTANCES, A FEE INTEREST IS ACQUIRED WHERE BOTH THE SURFACE AND THE UNDERLYING MINERAL INTERESTS ARE OWNED OUTRIGHT.

CANADA

EXPLORATION PERMITS ARE GRANTED FOR VARYING PERIODS OF TIME WITH RENEWALS POSSIBLE. PRODUCTION LEASES ARE HELD AS LONG AS THERE IS PRODUCTION ON THE

LEASE. THE MAJORITY OF COLD LAKE LEASES WERE TAKEN FOR AN INITIAL 21-YEAR TERM IN 1968-1969 AND RENEWED FOR A SECOND 21-YEAR TERM IN 1989-1990. THE EXPLORATION ACREAGE IN EASTERN CANADA IS CURRENTLY HELD BY WORK COMMITMENTS OF VARIOUS AMOUNTS.

INFORMATION WITH REGARD TO MINING ACTIVITIES FOLLOWS

.

SYNCRUDE OPERATIONS

SYNCRUDE IS A JOINT-VENTURE ESTABLISHED TO RECOVER SHALLOW DEPOSITS OF TAR SANDS USING OPEN-PIT MINING METHODS, TO EXTRACT THE CRUDE BITUMEN, AND TO

PRODUCE A HIGH-QUALITY, LIGHT (32 DEGREE API), SWEET, SYNTHETIC CRUDE OIL. THE SYNCRUDE OPERATION, LOCATED NEAR FORT MCMURRAY, ALBERTA, CANADA, EXPLOITS A PORTION OF THE ATHABASCA OIL SANDS DEPOSIT. THE LOCATION IS READILY ACCESSIBLE BY PUBLIC ROAD.

THE PRODUCED SYNTHETIC CRUDE OIL IS SHIPPED FROM THE SYNCRUDE SITE TO EDMONTON, ALBERTA BY ALBERTA OIL SANDS PIPELINE LTD. SINCE START-UP IN 1978, SYNCRUDE HAS PRODUCED ABOUT 1.6 BILLION BARRELS OF SYNTHETIC CRUDE OIL. IMPERIAL OIL LIMITED IS THE

OWNER OF A 25 PERCENT INTEREST IN THE JOINT-VENTURE. EXXON MOBIL CORPORATION HAS A 69.6 PERCENT INTEREST IN IMPERIAL OIL LIMITED.

OPERATING LICENSE AND LEASES

SYNCRUDE HAS AN OPERATING LICENSE ISSUED BY THE PROVINCE OF ALBERTA WHICH IS EFFECTIVE UNTIL 2035. THIS LICENSE PERMITS SYNCRUDE TO MINE TAR SANDS AND

PRODUCE SYNTHETIC CRUDE OIL FROM APPROVED DEVELOPMENT AREAS ON TAR SANDS LEASES. SYNCRUDE HOLDS EIGHT TAR SANDS LEASES COVERING APPROXIMATELY 252,000 ACRES IN THE ATHABASCA OIL SANDS DEPOSIT WHICH WERE ISSUED BY THE PROVINCE OF ALBERTA. THE LEASES

ARE AUTOMATICALLY RENEWABLE AS LONG AS TAR SANDS OPERATIONS ARE ONGOING OR THE LEASES ARE PART OF AN APPROVED DEVELOPMENT PLAN. SYNCRUDE LEASES 10, 12, 17, 22 AND 34 (CONTAINING PROVEN RESERVES) AND LEASES 29, 30 AND 31 (CONTAINING NO PROVEN

RESERVES) ARE INCLUDED WITHIN A DEVELOPMENT PLAN APPROVED BY THE PROVINCE OF ALBERTA. THERE WERE NO KNOWN PREVIOUS COMMERCIAL OPERATIONS ON THESE LEASES PRIOR TO THE START-UP OF OPERATIONS IN 1978.

OPERATIONS, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT

OPERATIONS AT SYNCRUDE INVOLVE THREE MAIN PROCESSES: OPEN PIT MINING,

EXTRACTION OF CRUDE BITUMEN AND UPGRADING OF CRUDE BITUMEN INTO SYNTHETIC CRUDE OIL. IN THE BASE MINE (LEASE 17), THE MINING AND TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM USES DRAGLINES, BUCKETWHEEL RECLAIMERS AND BELT CONVEYORS. IN THE

17

TABLE OF CONTENTS

INDEX TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NORTH MINE (LEASES 17 AND 22) AND IN THE AURORA MINE (LEASES 10, 12 AND 34), TRUCK, SHOVEL AND HYDROTRANSPORT SYSTEMS ARE USED. PRODUCTION FROM THE AURORA

MINE COMMENCED IN 2000. THE EXTRACTION FACILITIES, WHICH SEPARATE CRUDE BITUMEN FROM SAND, ARE CAPABLE OF PROCESSING APPROXIMATELY 545,000 TONS OF TAR SANDS A DAY, PRODUCING 110 MILLION BARRELS OF CRUDE BITUMEN A YEAR. THIS REPRESENTS RECOVERY

CAPABILITY OF ABOUT 92 PERCENT OF THE CRUDE BITUMEN CONTAINED IN THE MINED TAR SANDS.

CRUDE BITUMEN EXTRACTED FROM TAR SANDS IS REFINED TO A MARKETABLE HYDROCARBON PRODUCT THROUGH A COMBINATION OF CARBON REMOVAL IN TWO LARGE, HIGH-TEMPERATURE, FLUID-COKING VESSELS AND BY HYDROGEN ADDITION IN

HIGH-TEMPERATURE, HIGH-PRESSURE, HYDROCRACKING VESSELS. THESE PROCESSES REMOVE CARBON AND SULFUR AND REFORMULATE THE CRUDE INTO A LOW VISCOSITY, LOW SULFUR, HIGH-QUALITY SYNTHETIC CRUDE OIL PRODUCT. IN 2005, THIS UPGRADING PROCESS YIELDED 0.853

BARRELS OF SYNTHETIC CRUDE OIL PER BARREL OF CRUDE BITUMEN. IN 2005 ABOUT 49 PERCENT OF THE SYNTHETIC CRUDE OIL WAS PROCESSED BY EDMONTON AREA REFINERIES AND THE REMAINING 51 PERCENT WAS PIPELINED TO REFINERIES IN EASTERN CANADA AND EXPORTED,

PRIMARILY TO THE UNITED STATES. ELECTRICITY IS PROVIDED TO SYNCRUDE BY A 270 MEGAWATT ELECTRICITY GENERATING PLANT AND AN 80 MEGAWATT ELECTRICITY GENERATING PLANT, BOTH LOCATED AT SYNCRUDE. THE GENERATING PLANTS ARE OWNED BY THE SYNCRUDE

PARTICIPANTS. IMPERIAL OIL LIMITEDS 25 PERCENT SHARE OF NET INVESTMENT IN PLANT, PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT, INCLUDING SURFACE MINING FACILITIES, TRANSPORTATION EQUIPMENT AND UPGRADING FACILITIES WAS ABOUT $2.8 BILLION AT YEAR END 2005.

SYNTHETIC CRUDE OIL RESERVES

THE CRUDE BITUMEN IS CONTAINED WITHIN THE UNCONSOLIDATED SANDS OF THE

MCMURRAY FORMATION. ORE BODIES ARE BURIED BENEATH 50 TO 150 FEET OF OVERBURDEN, HAVE BITUMEN GRADES RANGING FROM 4 TO 14 WEIGHT PERCENT AND ORE THICKNESS OF 115 TO 160 FEET. ESTIMATES OF SYNTHETIC CRUDE OIL RESERVES ARE BASED ON DETAILED GEOLOGICAL

AND ENGINEERING ASSESSMENTS OF IN-PLACE CRUDE BITUMEN VOLUME, THE MINING PLAN, HISTORICAL EXTRACTION RECOVERY AND UPGRADING YIELD FACTORS, INSTALLED PLANT OPERATING CAPACITY AND OPERATING APPROVAL LIMITS. THE IN-PLACE VOLUME, DEPTH AND GRADE ARE

ESTABLISHED THROUGH EXTENSIVE AND CLOSELY SPACED CORE DRILLING. PROVEN RESERVES INCLUDE THE OPERATING BASE AND NORTH MINES AND THE AURORA MINE. IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE APPROVED MINING PLAN, THERE ARE AN ESTIMATED 1,890 MILLION TONS OF EXTRACTABLE TAR

SANDS IN THE BASE AND NORTH MINES, WITH AN AVERAGE BITUMEN GRADE OF 10.6 WEIGHT PERCENT. IN ADDITION, AT THE AURORA MINE, THERE ARE AN ESTIMATED 4,485 MILLION TONS OF EXTRACTABLE TAR SANDS AT AN AVERAGE BITUMEN GRADE OF 11.2 WEIGHT PERCENT. AFTER

DEDUCTING ROYALTIES PAYABLE TO THE PROVINCE OF ALBERTA, IMPERIAL OIL LIMITED ESTIMATES THAT ITS 25 PERCENT NET SHARE OF PROVEN RESERVES AT YEAR END 2005 WAS EQUIVALENT TO 738 MILLION BARRELS OF SYNTHETIC CRUDE OIL.

IN 2001, THE SYNCRUDE OWNERS ENDORSED A FURTHER DEVELOPMENT OF THE SYNCRUDE

RESOURCE IN THE AREA AND EXPANSION OF THE UPGRADING FACILITIES. THE SYNCRUDE AURORA 2 AND UPGRADER EXPANSION 1 PROJECT ADDS A REMOTE MINING TRAIN AND EXPANDS THE CENTRAL PROCESSING AND UPGRADING PLANT. THE AURORA 2 MINING AND EXTRACTION DEVELOPMENT

BECAME FULLY OPERATIONAL IN 2004. THE UPGRADER EXPANSION WILL BE COMPLETED IN 2006. WHEN COMPLETED, THIS PROJECT WILL INCREASE PRODUCTION CAPACITY TO 350 THOUSAND BARRELS OF SYNTHETIC CRUDE OIL PER DAY (GROSS).

FREQUENTLY USED TERMS

LISTED BELOW ARE DEFINITIONS OF SEVERAL OF EXXONMOBILS KEY BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE

MEASURES. THESE DEFINITIONS ARE PROVIDED TO FACILITATE UNDERSTANDING OF THE TERMS AND THEIR CALCULATION.

CASH FLOW FROM OPERATIONS AND ASSET SALES

CASH FLOW FROM OPERATIONS AND ASSET SALES IS THE SUM OF THE NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES AND PROCEEDS FROM SALES OF SUBSIDIARIES,

INVESTMENTS AND PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT FROM THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS. THIS CASH FLOW IS THE TOTAL SOURCES OF CASH FROM BOTH OPERATING THE CORPORATIONS ASSETS AND FROM THE DIVESTING OF ASSETS. THE CORPORATION EMPLOYS A

LONG-STANDING AND REGULAR DISCIPLINED REVIEW PROCESS TO ENSURE THAT ALL ASSETS ARE CONTRIBUTING TO THE CORPORATIONS STRATEGIC AND FINANCIAL OBJECTIVES. ASSETS ARE DIVESTED WHEN THEY ARE NO LONGER MEETING THESE OBJECTIVES OR ARE WORTH

CONSIDERABLY MORE TO OTHERS. BECAUSE OF THE REGULAR NATURE OF THIS ACTIVITY, WE BELIEVE IT IS USEFUL FOR INVESTORS TO CONSIDER SALES PROCEEDS TOGETHER WITH CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES WHEN EVALUATING CASH AVAILABLE FOR INVESTMENT IN THE

BUSINESS AND FINANCING ACTIVITIES, INCLUDING SHAREHOLDER DISTRIBUTIONS.

CAPITAL EMPLOYED IS A MEASURE OF NET INVESTMENT. WHEN VIEWED FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF HOW THE CAPITAL IS USED BY THE BUSINESSES, IT INCLUDES EXXONMOBILS NET SHARE OF PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT AND OTHER ASSETS LESS LIABILITIES,

EXCLUDING BOTH SHORT-TERM AND LONG-TERM DEBT. WHEN VIEWED FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF THE SOURCES OF CAPITAL EMPLOYED IN TOTAL FOR THE CORPORATION, IT INCLUDES EXXONMOBILS SHARE OF TOTAL DEBT AND SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY. BOTH OF THESE VIEWS

INCLUDE EXXONMOBILS SHARE OF AMOUNTS APPLICABLE TO EQUITY COMPANIES, WHICH THE CORPORATION BELIEVES SHOULD BE INCLUDED TO PROVIDE A MORE COMPREHENSIVE MEASURE OF CAPITAL EMPLOYED.

RETURN ON AVERAGE CAPITAL EMPLOYED

RETURN ON AVERAGE CAPITAL EMPLOYED (ROCE) IS A PERFORMANCE MEASURE RATIO. FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF THE BUSINESS SEGMENTS, ROCE IS ANNUAL BUSINESS SEGMENT EARNINGS DIVIDED BY AVERAGE BUSINESS SEGMENT CAPITAL EMPLOYED

(AVERAGE OF BEGINNING AND END-OF-YEAR AMOUNTS). THESE SEGMENT EARNINGS INCLUDE EXXONMOBILS SHARE OF SEGMENT EARNINGS OF EQUITY COMPANIES, CONSISTENT WITH OUR CAPITAL EMPLOYED DEFINITION, AND EXCLUDE THE COST OF FINANCING. THE

CORPORATIONS TOTAL ROCE IS NET INCOME EXCLUDING THE AFTER-TAX COST OF FINANCING, DIVIDED BY TOTAL CORPORATE AVERAGE CAPITAL EMPLOYED. THE CORPORATION HAS CONSISTENTLY APPLIED ITS ROCE DEFINITION FOR MANY YEARS AND VIEWS IT AS THE BEST MEASURE

OF HISTORICAL CAPITAL PRODUCTIVITY IN OUR CAPITAL-INTENSIVE, LONG-TERM INDUSTRY, BOTH TO EVALUATE MANAGEMENTS PERFORMANCE AND TO DEMONSTRATE TO SHAREHOLDERS THAT CAPITAL HAS BEEN USED WISELY OVER THE LONG TERM. ADDITIONAL MEASURES, WHICH TEND

TO BE MORE CASH FLOW BASED, ARE USED FOR FUTURE INVESTMENT DECISIONS.

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS. ACTUAL FUTURE RESULTS, INCLUDING DEMAND GROWTH AND MIX; CAPACITY INCREASES; PRODUCTION GROWTH AND MIX; FINANCING SOURCES; THE RESOLUTION OF CONTINGENCIES; THE EFFECT OF CHANGES IN PRICES; INTEREST RATES AND OTHER MARKET

CONDITIONS; AND ENVIRONMENTAL AND CAPITAL EXPENDITURES COULD DIFFER MATERIALLY DEPENDING ON A NUMBER OF FACTORS, SUCH AS THE OUTCOME OF COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS; CHANGES IN THE SUPPLY OF AND DEMAND FOR CRUDE OIL, NATURAL GAS, AND PETROLEUM AND

PETROCHEMICAL PRODUCTS; AND OTHER FACTORS DISCUSSED HEREIN AND IN ITEM 1A OF EXXONMOBILS 2005 FORM 10-K.

OVERVIEW

THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF EXXONMOBILS FINANCIAL RESULTS, AS WELL AS THE ACCOMPANYING FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS AND RELATED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS TO WHICH THEY REFER, ARE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE MANAGEMENT OF EXXON MOBIL CORPORATION. THE CORPORATIONS ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL REPORTING FAIRLY REFLECT ITS STRAIGHTFORWARD

BUSINESS MODEL INVOLVING THE EXTRACTING, REFINING AND MARKETING OF HYDROCARBONS AND HYDROCARBON-BASED PRODUCTS. THE CORPORATIONS BUSINESS MODEL INVOLVES THE PRODUCTION (OR PURCHASE), MANUFACTURE AND SALE OF PHYSICAL PRODUCTS, AND ALL

COMMERCIAL ACTIVITIES ARE DIRECTLY IN SUPPORT OF THE UNDERLYING PHYSICAL MOVEMENT OF GOODS. OUR CONSISTENT, CONSERVATIVE APPROACH TO FINANCING THE CAPITAL-INTENSIVE NEEDS OF THE CORPORATION HAS HELPED EXXONMOBIL TO SUSTAIN THE TRIPLE-A

STATUS OF ITS LONG-TERM DEBT SECURITIES FOR 87 YEARS.

EXXONMOBIL, WITH ITS RESOURCE BASE, FINANCIAL STRENGTH, DISCIPLINED INVESTMENT

APPROACH AND TECHNOLOGY PORTFOLIO, IS WELL-POSITIONED TO PARTICIPATE IN SUBSTANTIAL INVESTMENTS TO DEVELOP NEW ENERGY SUPPLIES. WHILE COMMODITY PRICES REMAIN VOLATILE ON A SHORT-TERM BASIS DEPENDING ON SUPPLY AND DEMAND, EXXONMOBILS INVESTMENT

DECISIONS ARE BASED ON OUR LONG-TERM OUTLOOK, USING A DISCIPLINED APPROACH IN SELECTING AND PURSUING THE MOST ATTRACTIVE INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES. THE CORPORATE PLAN IS A FUNDAMENTAL ANNUAL MANAGEMENT PROCESS THAT IS THE BASIS FOR SETTING

RISK-ASSESSED NEAR-TERM OPERATING AND CAPITAL OBJECTIVES IN ADDITION TO PROVIDING THE LONGER-TERM ECONOMIC ASSUMPTIONS USED FOR INVESTMENT EVALUATION PURPOSES. VOLUMES ARE BASED ON INDIVIDUAL FIELD PRODUCTION PROFILES, WHICH ARE ALSO UPDATED

ANNUALLY. PRICES FOR CRUDE OIL, NATURAL GAS AND REFINED PRODUCTS ARE BASED ON CORPORATE PLAN ASSUMPTIONS DEVELOPED ANNUALLY BY MAJOR REGION AND USED FOR INVESTMENT EVALUATION PURPOSES. POTENTIAL INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES ARE TESTED OVER A WIDE RANGE

OF ECONOMIC SCENARIOS TO ESTABLISH THE RESILIENCY OF EACH OPPORTUNITY. ONCE INVESTMENTS ARE MADE, A REAPPRAISAL PROCESS IS COMPLETED TO ENSURE RELEVANT LESSONS ARE LEARNED AND IMPROVEMENTS ARE INCORPORATED INTO FUTURE PROJECTS. EXXONMOBIL VIEWS

RETURN ON CAPITAL EMPLOYED AS THE BEST MEASURE OF HISTORICAL CAPITAL PRODUCTIVITY.

BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT AND RISK ASSESSMENT

LONG-TERM BUSINESS OUTLOOK

BY 2030, THE WORLDS POPULATION IS EXPECTED GROW TO 8 BILLION, APPROXIMATELY 25 PERCENT HIGHER THAN TODAYS LEVEL. COINCIDENT WITH THIS POPULATION INCREASE, THE

CORPORATION EXPECTS WORLDWIDE ECONOMIC GROWTH TO AVERAGE JUST UNDER 3 PERCENT PER YEAR. THIS COMBINATION OF POPULATION AND ECONOMIC GROWTH SHOULD LEAD TO A PRIMARY ENERGY DEMAND INCREASE OF APPROXIMATELY 50 PERCENT BY 2030. THE VAST MAJORITY (80

PERCENT) OF THE INCREASE IS EXPECTED TO OCCUR IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES.

AS DEMAND RISES, ENERGY EFFICIENCY WILL BECOME INCREASINGLY

IMPORTANT, WITH THE PACE OF IMPROVEMENT LIKELY TO ACCELERATE. THIS ACCELERATED PACE IS THE OUTCOME OF EXPECTED IMPROVEMENTS IN PERSONAL TRANSPORTATION AND POWER GENERATION DRIVEN BY THE INTRODUCTION OF NEW TECHNOLOGIES, AS WELL AS A MYRIAD OF OTHER

IMPROVEMENTS WHICH SPAN THE RESIDENTIAL, COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL SECTORS.

FOSSIL FUELS, INCLUDING COAL, ARE EXPECTED TO REMAIN THE

PREDOMINANT ENERGY SOURCES WITH APPROXIMATELY 80 PERCENT SHARE OF TOTAL ENERGY. OIL AND GAS ALONE ARE EXPECTED TO BE ABOUT 60 PERCENT. THESE WELL-ESTABLISHED FUEL SOURCES ARE THE ONLY ONES WITH THE VERSATILITY AND SCALE TO MEET THE MAJORITY OF THE

WORLDS GROWING ENERGY NEEDS. NUCLEAR POWER WILL LIKELY BE A GROWING OPTION TO MEET ELECTRICITY NEEDS. ALTERNATIVE FUELS, SUCH AS SOLAR AND WIND POWER, WILL GROW RAPIDLY, UNDERPINNED BY GOVERNMENT SUBSIDIES AND MANDATES. BUT EVEN WITH

ASSUMPTIONS OF ROBUST 10 PERCENT PER YEAR GROWTH, SOLAR AND WIND ARE EXPECTED TO REPRESENT JUST 1 PERCENT OF THE TOTAL ENERGY PORTFOLIO BY 2030.

OIL DEMAND SHOULD GROW AT 1.4 PERCENT PER YEAR, PRIMARILY DUE TO THE INCREASING NUMBER OF LIGHT DUTY VEHICLES IN THE TRANSPORTATION SECTOR, PARTLY OFFSET BY IMPROVEMENTS IN FUEL EFFICIENCY.

NATURAL GAS AND COAL ARE BOTH EXPECTED TO GROW AT 1.8 PERCENT ANNUALLY DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY INCREASED NEED FOR ELECTRIC POWER GENERATION. THE CORPORATION EXPECTS THE LIQUEFIED NATURAL GAS (LNG) MARKET TO QUINTUPLE BY 2030, HELPING TO MEET RISING

IMPORT DEPENDENCY IN EUROPE, NORTH AMERICA AND ASIA. WITH EQUITY POSITIONS IN MANY OF THE LARGEST REMOTE GAS ACCUMULATIONS IN THE WORLD, THE CORPORATION IS POSITIONED TO BENEFIT FROM ITS TECHNOLOGY ADVANCES IN GAS LIQUEFACTION, TRANSPORTATION AND

REGASIFICATION THAT ENABLE DISTANT GAS SUPPLIES TO REACH MARKETS ECONOMICALLY.

THE CORPORATION EXPECTS THE WORLDS RESERVE

BASE TO GROW NOT ONLY FROM NEW DISCOVERIES, BUT ALSO FROM INCREASES TO KNOWN RESERVES. TECHNOLOGY WILL UNDERPIN THESE INCREASES. THE COST TO DEVELOP THESE RESERVES IS ALSO LARGE. ACCORDING TO THE INTERNATIONAL ENERGY AGENCY, THE INVESTMENT REQUIRED

TO MEET TOTAL OIL AND GAS ENERGY NEEDS WORLDWIDE THROUGH 2030 WILL BE ABOUT $200 BILLION PER YEAR, OR $5 TRILLION IN TOTAL.

UPSTREAM

EXXONMOBIL MAINTAINS THE LARGEST PORTFOLIO OF DEVELOPMENT AND EXPLORATION OPPORTUNITIES AMONG THE INTERNATIONAL OIL COMPANIES, WHICH ENABLES THE

SELECTIVITY REQUIRED TO OPTIMIZE TOTAL PROFITABILITY AND MITIGATE OVERALL POLITICAL AND TECHNICAL RISKS. AS FUTURE DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS BRING NEW PRODUCTION ON LINE, THE CORPORATION EXPECTS A SHIFT IN THE GEOGRAPHIC MIX OF ITS PRODUCTION VOLUMES

BETWEEN NOW AND 2010. OIL AND NATURAL GAS OUTPUT FROM WEST AFRICA, THE CASPIAN, THE MIDDLE EAST AND RUSSIA IS EXPECTED TO MORE THAN DOUBLE DURING THE NEXT FIVE YEARS BASED ON CURRENT CAPITAL PROJECT EXECUTION PLANS. CURRENTLY, THESE GROWTH AREAS

ACCOUNT FOR JUST OVER 25 PERCENT OF THE CORPORATIONS PRODUCTION. BY THE END OF THE DECADE, THEY ARE EXPECTED TO GENERATE ABOUT 50 PERCENT OF TOTAL VOLUMES. THE REMAINDER OF THE CORPORATIONS PRODUCTION IS EXPECTED TO BE SOURCED FROM

ESTABLISHED AREAS, INCLUDING EUROPE AND NORTH AMERICA.

32

TABLE OF CONTENTS

INDEX TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

IN ADDITION TO A CHANGING GEOGRAPHIC MIX, THERE WILL ALSO BE A CHANGE IN THE TYPE OF OPPORTUNITIES

FROM WHICH VOLUMES ARE PRODUCED. PRODUCTION USING ARCTIC TECHNOLOGY, DEEPWATER DRILLING AND PRODUCTION SYSTEMS, HEAVY OIL RECOVERY PROCESSES AND LNG IS EXPECTED TO GROW FROM 25 PERCENT TO 35 PERCENT OF THE CORPORATIONS OUTPUT BETWEEN NOW AND

2010. THE CORPORATIONS OVERALL VOLUME CAPACITY OUTLOOK, BASED ON PROJECTS COMING ON STREAM AS ANTICIPATED, IS FOR PRODUCTION CAPACITY TO GROW OVER THE PERIOD 2006-2010. HOWEVER, ACTUAL VOLUMES WILL VARY FROM YEAR TO YEAR DUE TO TIMING OF

INDIVIDUAL PROJECT START-UPS, OPERATIONAL OUTAGES, RESERVOIR PERFORMANCE, REGULATORY CHANGES, ASSET SALES, SEVERE WEATHER EVENTS, PRICE EFFECTS UNDER PRODUCTION SHARING CONTRACTS AND OTHER FACTORS DESCRIBED IN ITEM 1A OF EXXONMOBILS 2005

FORM 10-K.

DOWNSTREAM

THE DOWNSTREAM

INDUSTRY ENVIRONMENT REMAINS VERY COMPETITIVE. WHILE REFINING MARGINS IN 2005 WERE STRONG, OUR LONG-TERM REAL REFINING MARGINS HAVE DECLINED AT A RATE OF ABOUT 1 PERCENT PER YEAR OVER THE PAST 20 YEARS. THE INTENSE COMPETITION IN THE RETAIL FUELS

MARKET HAS SIMILARLY DRIVEN DOWN REAL MARGINS BY ABOUT 4 PERCENT PER YEAR. GLOBAL REFINING CAPACITY IS EXPECTED TO GROW AT ABOUT 1 TO 2 PERCENT PER YEAR THROUGH 2010 WITH ASIA PACIFIC EXPECTED TO GROW AT MORE THAN 3 PERCENT PER YEAR. EXXONMOBIL

ASSETS ARE WELL-POSITIONED TO SUPPLY THE GROWING DEMAND FOR PETROLEUM PRODUCTS AND OUR CONTINUOUS FOCUS ON MAKING OUR REFINERIES MORE EFFICIENT AND PRODUCTIVE HAS RESULTED IN SIGNIFICANT CAPACITY INCREASES TO HELP MEET GROWING DEMAND AT A FRACTION

OF THE COST OF BUILDING A NEW REFINERY. OUR CAPACITY GROWTH RATE OVER THE PAST 10 YEARS AT EXISTING FACILITIES HAS BEEN THE EQUIVALENT OF BUILDING A NEW MID-SIZED REFINERY EVERY 3 YEARS.

REFINING MARGINS ARE A FUNCTION OF THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WHAT A REFINERY PAYS FOR ITS RAW MATERIALS (PRIMARILY CRUDE OIL) AND THE MARKET PRICES FOR THE

RANGE OF PRODUCTS PRODUCED (PRIMARILY GASOLINE, HEATING OIL, JET FUEL AND FUEL OIL). CRUDE OIL AND MANY PRODUCTS ARE WIDELY TRADED WITH PUBLISHED PRICES, INCLUDING THOSE QUOTED ON MULTIPLE EXCHANGES AROUND THE WORLD (E.G., NEW YORK MERCANTILE

EXCHANGE AND INTERNATIONAL PETROLEUM EXCHANGE). PRICES FOR THESE COMMODITIES (CRUDE AND VARIOUS PRODUCTS) ARE DETERMINED BY THE GLOBAL MARKETPLACE AND ARE IMPACTED BY MANY FACTORS, INCLUDING GLOBAL AND REGIONAL SUPPLY/DEMAND BALANCES, INVENTORY

LEVELS, REFINERY OPERATIONS, IMPORT/EXPORT BALANCES, SEASONALITY AND WEATHER AND POLITICAL CLIMATE. THIS GLOBAL MARKET AND TRADE FLOW WAS PARTICULARLY EVIDENT FOLLOWING THE 2005 SUPPLY DISRUPTIONS IN THE UNITED STATES CAUSED BY HURRICANES KATRINA

AND RITA. FUEL PRICES INCREASED WHEN 25 PERCENT OF U.S. REFINING CAPACITY WAS SHUT DOWN. CONSUMERS REDUCED DEMAND, AND ADDITIONAL PRODUCT IMPORTS FLOWED INTO THE UNITED STATES. SUPPLY AND DEMAND CAME BACK INTO BALANCE QUICKLY, WITH AN ASSOCIATED

DECLINE IN PRICES.

THE OBJECTIVES OF EXXONMOBILS DOWNSTREAM STRATEGIES ARE TO POSITION THE CORPORATION TO BE THE INDUSTRY LEADER

UNDER A VARIETY OF MARKET CONDITIONS. THESE STRATEGIES INCLUDE MAINTAINING BEST-IN-CLASS OPERATIONS IN ALL ASPECTS OF THE BUSINESS, MAXIMIZING VALUE FROM LEADING-EDGE TECHNOLOGY, CAPITALIZING ON INTEGRATION WITH OTHER EXXONMOBIL BUSINESSES, AND

PROVIDING HIGH QUALITY, VALUED PRODUCTS AND SERVICES TO THE CORPORATIONS CUSTOMERS. EXXONMOBIL HAS AN OWNERSHIP INTEREST IN 45 REFINERIES, LOCATED IN 25 COUNTRIES, WITH DISTILLATION CAPACITY OF 6.4 MILLION BARRELS PER DAY AND LUBRICANT

BASESTOCK MANUFACTURING CAPACITY OF ABOUT 150 THOUSAND BARRELS PER DAY. EXXONMOBILS FUELS AND LUBES MARKETING BUSINESS PORTFOLIOS INCLUDE OPERATIONS IN OVER 150 COUNTRIES ON SIX CONTINENTS, SERVING A GLOBALLY DIVERSE CUSTOMER BASE. WORLD

CLASS SCALE AND INTEGRATION, INDUSTRY-LEADING EFFICIENCY, LEADING-EDGE TECHNOLOGY AND GLOBALLY RESPECTED BRANDS ENABLE EXXONMOBIL TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF ATTRACTIVE EMERGING-GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES AROUND THE GLOBE.

CHEMICAL

PETROCHEMICAL DEMAND CONTINUED TO BE SUPPORTED BY A STRONG

GLOBAL ECONOMY IN 2005, ALTHOUGH REDUCED PRODUCT AVAILABILITY AND DEMAND IN THE UNITED STATES IN THE AFTERMATH OF HURRICANES KATRINA AND RITA IMPACTED SALES VOLUMES. ASIAN DEMAND WAS STRONG, DRIVEN BY ECONOMIC AND INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION GROWTH.

EXXONMOBIL BENEFITED FROM CONTINUED STRONG RELIABILITY OF ITS OPERATIONS, AS WELL AS A PORTFOLIO OF PRODUCTS THAT INCLUDES MANY OF THE LARGEST-VOLUME AND HIGHEST-GROWTH PETROCHEMICALS IN THE GLOBAL ECONOMY. IN ADDITION TO BEING A WORLDWIDE SUPPLIER

OF PRIMARY PETROCHEMICAL PRODUCTS, CHEMICAL ALSO HAS A DIVERSE PORTFOLIO OF LESS-CYCLICAL BUSINESS LINES. CHEMICALS COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGES ARE ACHIEVED THROUGH ITS BUSINESS MIX, BROAD GEOGRAPHIC COVERAGE, INVESTMENT DISCIPLINE, INTEGRATION OF

CHEMICAL CAPACITY WITH LARGE REFINING COMPLEXES OR UPSTREAM GAS PROCESSING, OPERATIONAL EXCELLENCE, LEADING PROPRIETARY TECHNOLOGY AND PRODUCT APPLICATION EXPERTISE.

EARNINGS TOTALED $24,349 MILLION, INCLUDING $1,620 MILLION FROM A GAIN RELATED TO THE DUTCH GAS RESTRUCTURING. ABSENT THIS, UPSTREAM EARNINGS INCREASED $6,054 MILLION FROM 2004 DUE TO HIGHER LIQUIDS AND NATURAL GAS REALIZATIONS PARTLY OFFSET BY

LOWER PRODUCTION VOLUME. OIL EQUIVALENT PRODUCTION WAS DOWN 4 PERCENT VERSUS 2004 INCLUDING THE IMPACT OF HURRICANES KATRINA AND RITA, AS WELL AS DIVESTMENT AND ENTITLEMENT EFFECTS. EXCLUDING THESE IMPACTS, TOTAL OIL EQUIVALENT PRODUCTION DECREASED

BY 1 PERCENT. LIQUIDS PRODUCTION OF 2,523 KBD (THOUSANDS OF BARRELS DAILY) DECREASED BY 48 KBD FROM 2004. PRODUCTION INCREASES FROM NEW PROJECTS IN WEST AFRICA, THE NORTH SEA AND NORTH AMERICA WERE OFFSET BY NATURAL FIELD DECLINE IN MATURE AREAS,

THE IMPACT OF HURRICANES KATRINA AND RITA, AS WELL AS DIVESTMENT AND ENTITLEMENT EFFECTS. NATURAL GAS PRODUCTION OF 9,251 MCFD (MILLIONS OF CUBIC FEET DAILY) DECREASED 613 MCFD FROM 2004. HIGHER VOLUMES FROM PROJECTS IN QATAR, THE NORTH SEA AND

NORTH AMERICA WERE OFFSET BY MATURE FIELD DECLINE, THE IMPACT OF HURRICANES KATRINA AND RITA, MAINTENANCE ACTIVITY, LOWER EUROPEAN DEMAND, AS WELL AS ENTITLEMENT AND DIVESTMENT IMPACTS. IMPROVED EARNINGS FROM BOTH U.S. AND NON-U.S. UPSTREAM

OPERATIONS WERE DRIVEN BY HIGHER LIQUIDS AND NATURAL GAS REALIZATIONS, PARTLY OFFSET BY LOWER PRODUCTION VOLUMES. EARNINGS FROM U.S. UPSTREAM OPERATIONS FOR 2005 WERE $6,200 MILLION, AN INCREASE OF $1,252 MILLION. EARNINGS OUTSIDE THE U.S. FOR 2005,

INCLUDING THE $1,620 MILLION GAIN RELATED TO THE DUTCH GAS RESTRUCTURING, WERE $18,149 MILLION, AN INCREASE OF $6,422 MILLION.

2004

UPSTREAM EARNINGS OF $16,675 MILLION INCREASED $2,173 MILLION DUE TO HIGHER LIQUIDS AND NATURAL GAS REALIZATIONS. UPSTREAM EARNINGS FOR 2003 INCLUDED A $1,700 MILLION

TOTAL OIL-EQUIVALENT PRODUCTION WAS UP 3 PERCENT VERSUS 2003. LIQUIDS PRODUCTION OF 2,571 KBD INCREASED 55 KBD FROM 2003. PRODUCTION INCREASES IN WEST AFRICA AND NORWAY WERE PARTLY OFFSET BY NATURAL FIELD DECLINE IN MATURE AREAS, ENTITLEMENT EFFECTS

AND DIVESTMENT IMPACTS. NATURAL GAS PRODUCTION OF 9,864 MCFD IN 2004 COMPARED WITH 10,119 MCFD IN 2003. THE START-UP OF AN ADDITIONAL LNG TRAIN IN QATAR AND CONTRIBUTIONS FROM PROJECTS AND WORK PROGRAMS WERE MORE THAN OFFSET BY NATURAL FIELD

DECLINE, DIVESTMENT IMPACTS AND ENTITLEMENT EFFECTS. EARNINGS FROM U.S. UPSTREAM OPERATIONS FOR 2004 OF $4,948 MILLION WERE $1,043 MILLION HIGHER THAN 2003 DUE TO HIGHER REALIZATIONS PARTLY OFFSET BY LOWER PRODUCTION VOLUMES. EARNINGS OUTSIDE THE

U.S. FOR 2004 OF $11,727 MILLION WERE $1,130 MILLION HIGHER THAN 2003 DUE TO IMPROVED REALIZATIONS AND HIGHER PRODUCTION VOLUMES. EARNINGS OUTSIDE THE U.S. FOR 2003 INCLUDED A $1,700 MILLION FROM A GAIN ON THE TRANSFER OF SHARES IN RUHRGAS AG.

ARE DISCUSSED BELOW. FOR ADDITIONAL DETAILS, SEE THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS ON PAGE 51.

ALTHOUGH THE CORPORATION ISSUES LONG-TERM DEBT FROM TIME TO TIME AND MAINTAINS A REVOLVING COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAM, INTERNALLY GENERATED FUNDS COVER THE MAJORITY OF ITS FINANCIAL

REQUIREMENTS. THE MANAGEMENT OF CASH THAT MAY BE TEMPORARILY AVAILABLE AS SURPLUS TO THE CORPORATIONS IMMEDIATE NEEDS IS CAREFULLY CONTROLLED, BOTH TO OPTIMIZE RETURNS ON CASH BALANCES, AND TO ENSURE THAT IT IS SECURE AND READILY AVAILABLE TO

MEET THE CORPORATIONS CASH REQUIREMENTS AS THEY ARISE.

THE CORPORATION WILL NEED TO CONTINUALLY FIND AND DEVELOP NEW FIELDS, AND

CONTINUE TO DEVELOP AND APPLY NEW TECHNOLOGIES AND RECOVERY PROCESSES TO EXISTING FIELDS, IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN OR INCREASE PRODUCTION AND RESULTING CASH FLOWS IN FUTURE PERIODS. AFTER A PERIOD OF PRODUCTION AT PLATEAU RATES, IT IS THE NATURE OF OIL

AND GAS FIELDS EVENTUALLY TO PRODUCE AT DECLINING RATES FOR THE REMAINDER OF THEIR ECONOMIC LIFE. AVERAGED OVER ALL OUR EXISTING OIL AND GAS FIELDS AND WITHOUT NEW PROJECTS, EXXONMOBILS ENTITLEMENT PRODUCTION IS EXPECTED TO DECLINE AT

APPROXIMATELY SIX PERCENT PER YEAR THROUGH THE END OF THE DECADE, CONSISTENT WITH RECENT HISTORICAL PERFORMANCE. DECLINE RATES CAN VARY WIDELY BY INDIVIDUAL FIELD DUE TO A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE TYPE OF RESERVOIR,

FLUID PROPERTIES, RECOVERY MECHANISMS, AND AGE OF THE FIELD. FURTHERMORE, THE CORPORATIONS PRODUCTION ENTITLEMENTS FOR INDIVIDUAL FIELDS CAN VARY WITH PRICE AND CONTRACTUAL TERMS.

THE CORPORATION HAS LONG BEEN SUCCESSFUL AT OFFSETTING THE EFFECTS OF NATURAL FIELD DECLINE THROUGH DISCIPLINED INVESTMENTS AND ANTICIPATES SIMILAR

RESULTS IN THE FUTURE. PROJECTS ARE IN PROGRESS OR PLANNED TO INCREASE PRODUCTION CAPACITY. HOWEVER, THESE VOLUME INCREASES ARE SUBJECT TO A VARIETY OF RISKS INCLUDING PROJECT START-UP TIMING, OPERATIONAL OUTAGES, RESERVOIR PERFORMANCE, CRUDE OIL

AND NATURAL GAS PRICES, SEVERE WEATHER EVENTS, AND REGULATORY CHANGES. THE CORPORATIONS CASH FLOWS ARE ALSO HIGHLY DEPENDENT ON CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS PRICES.

THE CORPORATIONS FINANCIAL STRENGTH, AS EVIDENCED BY ITS AAA/AAA DEBT RATING, ENABLES IT TO MAKE LARGE, LONG-TERM CAPITAL EXPENDITURES. CAPITAL AND EXPLORATION EXPENDITURES IN 2005 WERE $17.7 BILLION, REFLECTING

THE CORPORATIONS CONTINUED ACTIVE INVESTMENT PROGRAM. THE CORPORATION EXPECTS SPENDING TO CONTINUE IN THIS RANGE FOR THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS, ALTHOUGH ACTUAL SPENDING COULD VARY DEPENDING ON PROGRESS OF INDIVIDUAL PROJECTS. THE CORPORATION HAS

A LARGE AND DIVERSE PORTFOLIO OF DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS AND EXPLORATION OPPORTUNITIES, WHICH HELPS MITIGATE THE OVERALL POLITICAL AND TECHNICAL RISKS OF THE CORPORATIONS UPSTREAM SEGMENT AND ASSOCIATED CASH FLOW. FURTHER, DUE TO ITS FINANCIAL

STRENGTH, DEBT CAPACITY AND DIVERSE PORTFOLIO OF OPPORTUNITIES, THE RISK ASSOCIATED WITH FAILURE OR DELAY OF ANY SINGLE PROJECT WOULD NOT HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE CORPORATIONS LIQUIDITY OR ABILITY TO GENERATE SUFFICIENT CASH FLOWS FOR

OPERATIONS AND ITS FIXED COMMITMENTS. THE PURCHASE AND SALE OF OIL AND GAS PROPERTIES HAVE NOT HAD A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE AMOUNT OR TIMING OF CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES.

CASH FLOW FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES

2005

CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES TOTALED $48.1 BILLION IN 2005, A $7.5 BILLION INCREASE FROM 2004. MAJOR SOURCES OF FUNDS WERE NET INCOME OF $36.1 BILLION, WHICH

INCREASED $10.8 BILLION, AND NON-CASH PROVISIONS OF $10.3 BILLION FOR DEPRECIATION AND DEPLETION. CONTRIBUTING TO THE INCREASED LEVEL OF CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES IN 2005 WAS THE NET TIMING EFFECT OF RECEIPTS OF NOTES AND ACCOUNTS

RECEIVABLE AND PAYMENTS OF ACCOUNTS AND OTHER PAYABLES IN A RISING PRICE ENVIRONMENT.

2004

CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES TOTALED $40.6 BILLION IN 2004, A $12.1 BILLION INCREASE FROM 2003. MAJOR SOURCES OF FUNDS WERE NET INCOME OF $25.3 BILLION, WHICH

INCREASED $3.8 BILLION, AND NON-CASH PROVISIONS OF $9.8 BILLION FOR DEPRECIATION AND DEPLETION. CONTRIBUTING TO THE INCREASED LEVEL OF CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES IN 2004 WAS $2.4 BILLION OF LOWER COMPANY CONTRIBUTIONS TO PENSION PLANS AND

$3.0 BILLION OF CASH RECEIVED RELATED TO THE U.S. TAX SETTLEMENT RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS IN 2003.

CASH FLOW FROM INVESTING ACTIVITIES

2005

CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES TOTALED $10.3 BILLION IN 2005,

$4.6 BILLION LOWER THAN 2004. IN 2004, THE CORPORATION PLEDGED $4.6 BILLION AS BOND COLLATERAL FOR A LITIGATION APPEAL (SEE 2004 COMMENTS BELOW). SPENDING FOR PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT INCREASED $1.9 BILLION. PROCEEDS FROM THE SALES OF

SUBSIDIARIES, INVESTMENTS AND PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT OF $6.0 BILLION IN 2005 INCREASED $3.3 BILLION, INCLUDING ALMOST $1.4 BILLION FROM THE SALE OF THE CORPORATIONS INTEREST IN SINOPEC.

2004

CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES TOTALED $14.9 BILLION IN

2004, $4.1 BILLION HIGHER THAN 2003. SPENDING FOR PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT DECREASED $0.9 BILLION. PROCEEDS FROM THE SALES OF SUBSIDIARIES, INVESTMENTS AND PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT IN 2004 INCREASED $0.5 BILLION TO $2.8 BILLION. AS

DISCUSSED IN NOTE 14 ON PAGE 68, INVESTING ACTIVITIES IN 2004 INCLUDED A PLEDGE BY THE CORPORATION OF $4.6 BILLION OF COLLATERAL CONSISTING OF CASH AND SHORT-TERM, HIGH-QUALITY SECURITIES TO THE ISSUER OF A LITIGATION-RELATED APPEAL BOND. THIS

COLLATERAL WAS REPORTED AS RESTRICTED CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS ON THE BALANCE SHEET.

2005

CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES WAS $26.9 BILLION, AN INCREASE

OF $8.6 BILLION FROM 2004, REFLECTING A HIGHER LEVEL OF PURCHASES OF EXXONMOBIL SHARES. DIVIDEND PAYMENTS ON COMMON SHARES INCREASED TO $1.14 PER SHARE FROM $1.06 PER SHARE AND TOTALED $7.2 BILLION, A PAYOUT OF 20 PERCENT. TOTAL CONSOLIDATED

SHORT-TERM AND LONG-TERM DEBT DECLINED $0.3 BILLION TO $8.0 BILLION AT YEAR-END 2005. SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY INCREASED $9.5 BILLION IN 2005, TO $111.2 BILLION, REFLECTING $36.1 BILLION OF NET INCOME PARTLY OFFSET BY DISTRIBUTIONS TO EXXONMOBIL

SHAREHOLDERS OF $7.2 BILLION OF DIVIDENDS AND $16.0 BILLION OF PURCHASES OF SHARES OF EXXONMOBIL STOCK TO REDUCE SHARES OUTSTANDING. SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY, AND NET ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, ALSO DECREASED $2.6 BILLION, REPRESENTING THE FOREIGN

EXCHANGE TRANSLATION EFFECTS OF WEAKER FOREIGN CURRENCIES AT THE END OF 2005 ON EXXONMOBILS OPERATIONS OUTSIDE THE U.S.

DURING 2005,

EXXON MOBIL CORPORATION PURCHASED 311 MILLION SHARES OF ITS COMMON STOCK FOR THE TREASURY AT A GROSS COST OF $18.2 BILLION. THESE PURCHASES WERE TO OFFSET SHARES ISSUED IN CONJUNCTION WITH COMPANY BENEFIT PLANS AND PROGRAMS AND TO REDUCE THE

NUMBER OF SHARES OUTSTANDING. SHARES OUTSTANDING WERE REDUCED 4.2 PERCENT FROM 6,401 MILLION AT THE END OF 2004 TO 6,133 MILLION AT THE END OF 2005. PURCHASES WERE MADE IN BOTH THE OPEN MARKET AND THROUGH NEGOTIATED TRANSACTIONS. PURCHASES

MAY BE INCREASED, DECREASED OR DISCONTINUED AT ANY TIME WITHOUT PRIOR NOTICE.

2004

CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES WAS $18.3 BILLION, AN INCREASE OF $3.5 BILLION FROM 2003, REFLECTING A HIGHER LEVEL OF PURCHASES OF EXXONMOBIL SHARES. DIVIDEND PAYMENTS ON COMMON SHARES INCREASED TO $1.06 PER SHARE

FROM $0.98 PER SHARE AND TOTALED $6.9 BILLION, A PAYOUT OF 27 PERCENT. TOTAL CONSOLIDATED SHORT-TERM AND LONG-TERM DEBT DECLINED $1.2 BILLION TO $8.3 BILLION AT YEAR-END 2004. SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY INCREASED $11.8 BILLION IN 2004 TO $101.7

BILLION, REFLECTING $25.3 BILLION OF NET INCOME PARTLY OFFSET BY DISTRIBUTIONS TO EXXONMOBIL SHAREHOLDERS OF $6.9 BILLION OF DIVIDENDS AND $8.0 BILLION OF PURCHASES OF SHARES OF EXXONMOBIL STOCK TO REDUCE SHARES OUTSTANDING. SHAREHOLDERS

EQUITY, AND NET ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, ALSO INCREASED $2.2 BILLION, REPRESENTING THE FOREIGN EXCHANGE TRANSLATION EFFECTS OF STRONGER FOREIGN CURRENCIES ON EXXONMOBILS OPERATIONS OUTSIDE THE U.S.

DURING 2004, EXXON MOBIL CORPORATION PURCHASED 218 MILLION SHARES OF ITS COMMON STOCK FOR THE TREASURY AT A GROSS COST OF $10.0 BILLION. THESE

PURCHASES WERE TO OFFSET SHARES ISSUED IN CONJUNCTION WITH COMPANY BENEFIT PLANS AND PROGRAMS AND TO REDUCE THE NUMBER OF SHARES OUTSTANDING. SHARES OUTSTANDING WERE REDUCED 2.5 PERCENT FROM 6,568 MILLION AT THE END OF 2003 TO

6,401 MILLION AT THE END OF 2004. PURCHASES WERE MADE IN BOTH THE OPEN MARKET AND THROUGH NEGOTIATED TRANSACTIONS.

PERTAIN TO TRANSPORTATION AND REFINING PURCHASES AND INCLUDE $2,008 MILLION OF OBLIGATIONS TO EQUITY COMPANIES. THE PRESENT VALUE OF THE TOTAL COMMITMENTS, EXCLUDING IMPUTED INTEREST OF $1,287 MILLION, TOTALED $4,724 MILLION.

(8)

FIRM COMMITMENTS RELATED TO CAPITAL PROJECTS, SHOWN ON AN UNDISCOUNTED BASIS, TOTALED APPROXIMATELY $7.6 BILLION. THESE COMMITMENTS WERE PREDOMINANTLY ASSOCIATED

WITH UPSTREAM PROJECTS OUTSIDE THE U.S., OF WHICH THE TWO LARGEST COMMITMENTS OUTSTANDING AT THE END OF 2005 WERE $1.9 BILLION AND $1.4 BILLION ASSOCIATED WITH THE DEVELOPMENT OF CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS RESOURCES IN MALAYSIA AND KAZAKHSTAN,

RESPECTIVELY. THE CORPORATION EXPECTS TO FUND THE MAJORITY OF THESE COMMITMENTS THROUGH INTERNAL CASH FLOW.

GUARANTEES

THE CORPORATION AND CERTAIN OF ITS CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES WERE CONTINGENTLY LIABLE AT DECEMBER 31, 2005, FOR $3,893 MILLION, PRIMARILY RELATING TO GUARANTEES FOR

NOTES, LOANS AND PERFORMANCE UNDER CONTRACTS (NOTE 14 ON PAGE 68). THIS INCLUDED $1,020 MILLION REPRESENTING GUARANTEES OF NON-U.S. EXCISE TAXES AND CUSTOMS DUTIES OF OTHER COMPANIES, ENTERED INTO AS A NORMAL BUSINESS PRACTICE, UNDER RECIPROCAL

ARRANGEMENTS. ALSO INCLUDED IN THIS AMOUNT WERE GUARANTEES BY CONSOLIDATED AFFILIATES OF $2,649 MILLION, REPRESENTING EXXONMOBILS SHARE OF OBLIGATIONS OF CERTAIN EQUITY COMPANIES. THE BELOW MENTIONED GUARANTEES ARE NOT REASONABLY LIKELY TO

HAVE A MATERIAL CURRENT OR FUTURE EFFECT ON THE CORPORATIONS FINANCIAL CONDITION, CHANGES IN FINANCIAL CONDITION, REVENUES OR EXPENSES, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, LIQUIDITY, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES OR CAPITAL RESOURCES.

MANAGEMENT VIEWS THE CORPORATIONS FINANCIAL STRENGTH, AS EVIDENCED BY THE ABOVE FINANCIAL RATIOS AND OTHER SIMILAR

MEASURES, TO BE A COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE OF STRATEGIC IMPORTANCE. THE CORPORATIONS SOUND FINANCIAL POSITION GIVES IT THE OPPORTUNITY TO ACCESS THE WORLDS CAPITAL MARKETS IN THE FULL RANGE OF MARKET CONDITIONS, AND ENABLES THE CORPORATION

TO TAKE ON LARGE, LONG-TERM CAPITAL COMMITMENTS IN THE PURSUIT OF MAXIMIZING SHAREHOLDER VALUE.

THE CORPORATION MAKES LIMITED USE OF

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS, WHICH ARE DISCUSSED IN RISK MANAGEMENT ON PAGE 41 AND NOTE 11 ON PAGE 62.

LITIGATION AND OTHER CONTINGENCIES

AS DISCUSSED IN NOTE 14 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS A NUMBER OF LAWSUITS, INCLUDING CLASS ACTIONS, WERE BROUGHT IN VARIOUS COURTS AGAINST EXXON MOBIL

CORPORATION AND CERTAIN OF ITS SUBSIDIARIES RELATING TO THE ACCIDENTAL RELEASE OF CRUDE OIL FROM THE TANKER EXXON VALDEZ IN 1989. THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE COMPENSATORY CLAIMS HAVE BEEN RESOLVED AND PAID. ALL OF THE PUNITIVE DAMAGE CLAIMS WERE

CONSOLIDATED IN THE CIVIL TRIAL THAT BEGAN IN 1994. THE FIRST JUDGMENT FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF ALASKA IN THE AMOUNT OF $5 BILLION WAS VACATED BY THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT AS BEING

EXCESSIVE UNDER THE CONSTITUTION. THE SECOND JUDGMENT IN THE AMOUNT OF $4 BILLION WAS VACATED BY THE NINTH CIRCUIT PANEL WITHOUT ARGUMENT AND SENT BACK FOR THE DISTRICT COURT TO RECONSIDER IN LIGHT OF THE RECENT U.S. SUPREME COURT DECISION IN

CAMPBELL V. STATE FARM

. THE MOST RECENT DISTRICT COURT JUDGMENT FOR PUNITIVE DAMAGES WAS FOR $4.5 BILLION PLUS INTEREST AND WAS ENTERED IN JANUARY 2004. EXXONMOBIL AND THE PLAINTIFFS HAVE APPEALED THIS DECISION TO THE NINTH CIRCUIT. THE

CORPORATION HAS POSTED A $5.4 BILLION LETTER OF CREDIT. ORAL ARGUMENTS WERE HELD BEFORE THE NINTH CIRCUIT ON JANUARY 27, 2006. MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT THE LIKELIHOOD OF THE JUDGMENT BEING UPHELD IS REMOTE. WHILE IT IS REASONABLY POSSIBLE THAT

A LIABILITY MAY HAVE BEEN INCURRED FROM THE EXXON VALDEZ GROUNDING, IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO PREDICT THE ULTIMATE OUTCOME OR TO REASONABLY ESTIMATE ANY SUCH POTENTIAL LIABILITY.

IN DECEMBER 2000, A JURY IN THE 15TH JUDICIAL CIRCUIT COURT OF MONTGOMERY COUNTY, ALABAMA, RETURNED A VERDICT AGAINST THE CORPORATION IN A DISPUTE OVER ROYALTIES IN THE

AMOUNT OF $88 MILLION IN COMPENSATORY DAMAGES AND $3.4 BILLION IN PUNITIVE DAMAGES IN THE CASE OF

EXXON CORPORATION V. STATE OF ALABAMA, ET AL

. THE VERDICT WAS UPHELD BY THE TRIAL COURT IN MAY 2001. IN DECEMBER 2002, THE ALABAMA SUPREME COURT

VACATED THE $3.5 BILLION JURY VERDICT. THE CASE WAS RETRIED AND IN NOVEMBER 2003, A STATE DISTRICT COURT JURY IN MONTGOMERY, ALABAMA, RETURNED A VERDICT AGAINST EXXON MOBIL CORPORATION. THE VERDICT INCLUDED $63.5 MILLION IN COMPENSATORY DAMAGES AND

$11.8 BILLION IN PUNITIVE DAMAGES. IN MARCH 2004, THE DISTRICT COURT JUDGE REDUCED THE AMOUNT OF PUNITIVE DAMAGES TO $3.5 BILLION. EXXONMOBIL BELIEVES THE JUDGMENT IS NOT JUSTIFIED BY THE EVIDENCE, THAT ANY PUNITIVE DAMAGE AWARD IS NOT JUSTIFIED BY

EITHER THE FACTS OR THE LAW, AND THAT THE AMOUNT OF THE AWARD IS GROSSLY EXCESSIVE AND UNCONSTITUTIONAL. EXXONMOBIL HAS APPEALED THE DECISION TO THE ALABAMA SUPREME COURT. MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT THE LIKELIHOOD OF THE JUDGMENT BEING UPHELD IS

REMOTE. WHILE IT IS REASONABLY POSSIBLE THAT A LIABILITY MAY HAVE BEEN INCURRED BY EXXONMOBIL FROM THIS DISPUTE OVER ROYALTIES, IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO PREDICT THE ULTIMATE OUTCOME OR TO REASONABLY ESTIMATE ANY SUCH POTENTIAL LIABILITY. IN MAY 2004,

THE CORPORATION POSTED A $4.5 BILLION SUPERSEDEAS BOND AS REQUIRED BY ALABAMA LAW TO STAY EXECUTION OF THE JUDGMENT PENDING APPEAL. THE CORPORATION HAS PLEDGED TO THE ISSUER OF THE BOND COLLATERAL CONSISTING OF CASH AND SHORT-TERM, HIGH-QUALITY

SECURITIES WITH AN AGGREGATE VALUE OF APPROXIMATELY $4.6 BILLION. THIS COLLATERAL IS REPORTED AS RESTRICTED CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET. UNDER THE TERMS OF THE PLEDGE AGREEMENT, THE CORPORATION IS ENTITLED TO RECEIVE

THE INCOME GENERATED FROM THE CASH AND SECURITIES AND TO MAKE INVESTMENT DECISIONS, BUT IS RESTRICTED FROM USING THE PLEDGED CASH AND SECURITIES FOR ANY OTHER PURPOSE UNTIL SUCH TIME THE BOND IS CANCELED.

IN 2001, A LOUISIANA STATE COURT JURY AWARDED COMPENSATORY DAMAGES OF $56 MILLION AND PUNITIVE DAMAGES OF $1 BILLION TO A

LANDOWNER FOR DAMAGE CAUSED BY A THIRD PARTY THAT LEASED THE PROPERTY FROM THE LANDOWNER. THE THIRD PARTY PROVIDED PIPE CLEANING AND STORAGE SERVICES FOR THE CORPORATION AND OTHER ENTITIES. THE LOUISIANA FOURTH CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS REDUCED THE

PUNITIVE DAMAGE AWARD TO $112 MILLION IN 2005. THE CORPORATION APPEALED THIS DECISION TO THE LOUISIANA SUPREME COURT AS IT CONTINUES TO BELIEVE THAT THESE JUDGMENTS SHOULD BE SUBSTANTIALLY REDUCED ON LEGAL AND CONSTITUTIONAL GROUNDS. WHILE IT IS

REASONABLY POSSIBLE THAT A LIABILITY MAY HAVE BEEN INCURRED, IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO PREDICT THE ULTIMATE OUTCOME OR TO REASONABLY ESTIMATE ANY SUCH POTENTIAL LIABILITY.

IN

ALLAPATTAH V. EXXON

, A JURY IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF

FLORIDA DETERMINED IN 2001 THAT A CLASS OF EXXON DEALERS BETWEEN MARCH 1983 AND AUGUST 1994 HAD BEEN OVERCHARGED FOR GASOLINE. IN JUNE 2003, THE ELEVENTH CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS AFFIRMED THE JUDGMENT AND IN MARCH 2004, DENIED A PETITION FOR

REHEARING EN BANC. IN OCTOBER 2004, THE U.S. SUPREME COURT GRANTED REVIEW AS TO WHETHER THE CLASS IN THE DISTRICT COURT JUDGMENT SHOULD INCLUDE MEMBERS THAT INDIVIDUALLY DO NOT SATISFY THE $50,000 MINIMUM AMOUNT-IN-CONTROVERSY REQUIREMENT IN FEDERAL

COURT. IN LIGHT OF THE SUPREME COURTS DECISION TO GRANT REVIEW OF ONLY PART OF EXXONMOBILS APPEAL, THE CORPORATION TOOK AN AFTER-TAX CHARGE OF $550 MILLION IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2004 REFLECTING THE ESTIMATED LIABILITY, AFTER

CONSIDERING POTENTIAL SET-OFFS AND DEFENSES FOR THE CLAIMS UNDER REVIEW BY THE SUPREME COURT. IN JUNE 2005, THE SUPREME COURT GRANTED THE DISTRICT COURT THE RIGHT TO HEAR THE CLAIMS OF ALL CLASS MEMBERS AND THE CORPORATION TOOK AN AFTER-TAX CHARGE

OF $200 MILLION. CLASS COUNSEL AND EXXONMOBIL ARE SEEKING COURT APPROVAL OF A SETTLEMENT OF $1,075 MILLION, PRE-TAX THAT WOULD ESSENTIALLY FINALIZE THE CORPORATIONS FINANCIAL OBLIGATION IN THE CASE; THIS OBLIGATION HAS BEEN FULLY ACCRUED. THE

TRIAL COURT HAS PRELIMINARILY APPROVED THE SETTLEMENT. NOTICE HAS BEEN ISSUED TO THE CLASS AND THE FINAL APPROVAL HEARING WILL OCCUR IN APRIL 2006.

TAX ISSUES FOR 1986 TO 1993 REMAIN PENDING BEFORE THE U.S. TAX COURT. THE ULTIMATE RESOLUTION OF THESE ISSUES IS NOT EXPECTED TO HAVE A MATERIALLY ADVERSE EFFECT UPON THE CORPORATIONS OPERATIONS OR FINANCIAL CONDITION.

BASED ON A CONSIDERATION OF ALL RELEVANT FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES, THE CORPORATION DOES NOT BELIEVE THE ULTIMATE OUTCOME OF ANY CURRENTLY PENDING LAWSUIT

AGAINST EXXONMOBIL WILL HAVE A MATERIALLY ADVERSE EFFECT UPON THE CORPORATIONS OPERATIONS OR FINANCIAL CONDITION. THERE ARE NO EVENTS OR UNCERTAINTIES KNOWN TO MANAGEMENT BEYOND THOSE ALREADY INCLUDED IN REPORTED FINANCIAL INFORMATION THAT

WOULD INDICATE A MATERIAL CHANGE IN FUTURE OPERATING RESULTS OR FINANCIAL CONDITION.

CAPITAL AND

EXPLORATION EXPENDITURES IN 2005 WERE $17.7 BILLION, REFLECTING THE CORPORATIONS CONTINUED ACTIVE INVESTMENT PROGRAM. THE CORPORATION EXPECTS SPENDING TO CONTINUE IN THIS RANGE FOR THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS. ACTUAL SPENDING COULD VARY DEPENDING

ON PROGRESS OF INDIVIDUAL PROJECTS.

UPSTREAM SPENDING WAS UP 24 PERCENT TO $14.5 BILLION IN 2005, FROM $11.7 BILLION IN 2004, AS A RESULT

OF HIGHER SPENDING IN GROWTH AREAS SUCH AS RUSSIA, THE CASPIAN, QATAR AND WEST AFRICA. IN ADDITION, SPENDING IN THE U.S., AUSTRALIA AND THE NORTH SEA WAS ALSO HIGHER. DURING THE PAST THREE YEARS, UPSTREAM CAPITAL AND EXPLORATION EXPENDITURES

AVERAGED $12.7 BILLION. THE MAJORITY OF THESE EXPENDITURES ARE ON MAJOR DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS, WHICH TYPICALLY TAKE TWO TO FOUR YEARS FROM THE TIME OF RECORDING PROVED UNDEVELOPED RESERVES TO THE START OF PRODUCTION FROM THOSE RESERVES. THE

PERCENTAGE OF PROVED DEVELOPED RESERVES HAS REMAINED RELATIVELY STABLE OVER THE PAST FIVE YEARS AT OVER 60 PERCENT OF TOTAL PROVED RESERVES, INDICATING THAT PROVED RESERVES ARE CONSISTENTLY MOVED FROM UNDEVELOPED TO DEVELOPED STATUS. CAPITAL AND

EXPLORATION EXPENDITURES ARE NOT TRACKED BY THE UNDEVELOPED AND DEVELOPED PROVED RESERVE CATEGORIES. CAPITAL INVESTMENTS IN THE DOWNSTREAM TOTALED $2.5 BILLION IN 2005, UP $0.1 BILLION FROM 2004. CHEMICAL CAPITAL EXPENDITURES WERE ESSENTIALLY

SHARE TRANSFER AND THE SETTLEMENT OF A U.S. TAX DISPUTE, THE EFFECTIVE RATE IN 2004 WAS SIMILAR TO 2003. DURING BOTH PERIODS, THE CORPORATION CONTINUED TO BENEFIT FROM THE FAVORABLE RESOLUTION OF OTHER TAX-RELATED ISSUES. EXCISE AND ALL OTHER TAXES

AND DUTIES OF $70.9 BILLION IN 2004 INCREASED $6.9 BILLION FROM 2003, REFLECTING HIGHER PRICES AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE EFFECTS.

ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS

THE FAIR VALUES OF ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS ARE RECORDED AS LIABILITIES ON A DISCOUNTED BASIS WHEN THEY ARE INCURRED, WHICH IS TYPICALLY AT THE TIME ASSETS ARE

INSTALLED, WITH AN OFFSETTING AMOUNT BOOKED AS ADDITIONS TO PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT ($165 MILLION FOR 2005). OVER TIME, THE LIABILITIES ARE ACCRETED FOR THE INCREASE IN THEIR PRESENT VALUE, WITH THIS EFFECT INCLUDED IN EXPENSES ($208 MILLION

IN 2005). PAYMENTS MADE FOR ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS IN 2005 WERE $193 MILLION, AND THE ENDING BALANCE OF THE OBLIGATIONS RECORDED ON THE BALANCE SHEET AT DECEMBER 31, 2005, TOTALED $3,568 MILLION.

THROUGHOUT EXXONMOBILS BUSINESSES, NEW AND ONGOING MEASURES ARE TAKEN TO PREVENT AND MINIMIZE THE IMPACT OF

OUR OPERATIONS ON THE AIR, WATER AND GROUND. THIS INCLUDES A SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT IN REFINING TECHNOLOGY TO MANUFACTURE LOW-SULFUR FUELS AS WELL AS PROJECTS TO REDUCE NITROGEN OXIDE AND SULFUR OXIDE EMISSIONS. EXXONMOBILS 2005 WORLDWIDE

ENVIRONMENTAL COSTS FOR ALL SUCH PREVENTATIVE AND REMEDIATION STEPS WERE ABOUT $3.3 BILLION, OF WHICH $1.2 BILLION WERE CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND $2.1 BILLION WERE INCLUDED IN EXPENSES. THE TOTAL COST FOR SUCH ACTIVITIES IS EXPECTED TO REMAIN IN THIS

RANGE IN 2006 AND 2007 (WITH CAPITAL EXPENDITURES APPROXIMATELY 35 PERCENT OF THE TOTAL).

THE CORPORATION ACCRUES LIABILITIES FOR

ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES WHEN IT IS PROBABLE THAT OBLIGATIONS HAVE BEEN INCURRED AND THE AMOUNTS CAN BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED. THIS POLICY APPLIES TO ASSETS OR BUSINESSES CURRENTLY OWNED OR PREVIOUSLY DISPOSED. EXXONMOBIL HAS ACCRUED LIABILITIES FOR

PROBABLE ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION OBLIGATIONS AT VARIOUS SITES, INCLUDING MULTIPARTY SITES WHERE THE U.S. ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY HAS IDENTIFIED EXXONMOBIL AS ONE OF THE POTENTIALLY RESPONSIBLE PARTIES. THE INVOLVEMENT OF OTHER FINANCIALLY

RESPONSIBLE COMPANIES AT THESE MULTIPARTY SITES MITIGATES EXXONMOBILS ACTUAL JOINT AND SEVERAL LIABILITY EXPOSURE. AT PRESENT, NO INDIVIDUAL SITE IS EXPECTED TO HAVE LOSSES MATERIAL TO EXXONMOBILS OPERATIONS OR FINANCIAL CONDITION.

PROVISIONS MADE IN 2005 FOR ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES WERE $487 MILLION ($340 MILLION IN 2004), INCLUDED IN THE $2.1 BILLION OF 2005 EXPENSES NOTED ABOVE, AND THE BALANCE SHEET REFLECTS ACCUMULATED LIABILITIES OF $849 MILLION AS OF DECEMBER 31,

CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES.

CRUDE OIL, NATURAL

GAS, PETROLEUM PRODUCT AND CHEMICAL PRICES HAVE FLUCTUATED IN RESPONSE TO CHANGING MARKET FORCES. THE IMPACTS OF THESE PRICE FLUCTUATIONS ON EARNINGS FROM UPSTREAM, DOWNSTREAM AND CHEMICAL OPERATIONS HAVE VARIED. IN THE UPSTREAM, BASED ON THE 2005

WORLDWIDE PRODUCTION LEVELS, A $1 PER BARREL CHANGE IN THE WEIGHTED-AVERAGE REALIZED PRICE OF OIL WOULD HAVE APPROXIMATELY A $400 MILLION ANNUAL AFTER-TAX EFFECT ON UPSTREAM CONSOLIDATED PLUS EQUITY COMPANY EARNINGS. SIMILARLY, A $0.10 PER KCF

CHANGE IN THE WORLDWIDE AVERAGE GAS REALIZATION WOULD HAVE APPROXIMATELY A $200 MILLION ANNUAL AFTER-TAX EFFECT ON UPSTREAM CONSOLIDATED PLUS EQUITY COMPANY EARNINGS. FOR ANY GIVEN PERIOD, THE EXTENT OF ACTUAL BENEFIT OR DETRIMENT WILL BE DEPENDENT

ON THE PRICE MOVEMENTS OF INDIVIDUAL TYPES OF CRUDE OIL, TAXES AND OTHER GOVERNMENT TAKE IMPACTS, PRICE ADJUSTMENT LAGS IN LONG-TERM GAS CONTRACTS, AND CRUDE AND GAS PRODUCTION VOLUMES. ACCORDINGLY, CHANGES IN BENCHMARK PRICES FOR CRUDE OIL AND

NATURAL GAS ONLY PROVIDE A BROAD INDICATOR OF CHANGES IN THE EARNINGS EXPERIENCED IN ANY PARTICULAR PERIOD.

IN THE VERY COMPETITIVE DOWNSTREAM AND CHEMICAL ENVIRONMENTS, EARNINGS ARE PRIMARILY DETERMINED BY MARGIN CAPTURE RATHER THAN ABSOLUTE PRICE LEVELS OF PRODUCTS SOLD. REFINING MARGINS ARE A

FUNCTION OF THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WHAT A REFINER PAYS FOR ITS RAW MATERIALS (PRIMARILY CRUDE OIL) AND THE MARKET PRICES FOR THE RANGE OF PRODUCTS PRODUCED. THESE PRICES IN TURN DEPEND ON GLOBAL AND REGIONAL SUPPLY/DEMAND BALANCES, INVENTORY LEVELS,

REFINERY OPERATIONS, IMPORT/EXPORT BALANCES AND WEATHER.

THE GLOBAL ENERGY MARKETS CAN GIVE RISE TO EXTENDED PERIODS IN WHICH MARKET

CONDITIONS ARE ADVERSE TO ONE OR MORE OF THE CORPORATIONS BUSINESSES. SUCH CONDITIONS, ALONG WITH THE CAPITAL-INTENSIVE NATURE OF THE INDUSTRY AND VERY LONG LEAD TIMES ASSOCIATED WITH MANY OF OUR PROJECTS, UNDERSCORE THE IMPORTANCE OF

MAINTAINING A STRONG FINANCIAL POSITION. MANAGEMENT VIEWS THE CORPORATIONS FINANCIAL STRENGTH, INCLUDING THE AAA AND AAA RATINGS OF ITS LONG-TERM DEBT SECURITIES BY STANDARD AND POORS AND MOODYS, AS A COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE.

IN GENERAL, SEGMENT RESULTS ARE NOT DEPENDENT ON THE ABILITY TO SELL AND/OR PURCHASE PRODUCTS TO/FROM OTHER SEGMENTS. INSTEAD, WHERE SUCH

SALES TAKE PLACE, THEY ARE THE RESULT OF EFFICIENCIES AND COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGES OF INTEGRATED REFINERY/CHEMICAL COMPLEXES. ADDITIONALLY, INTERSEGMENT SALES ARE MARKET-RELATED. THE PRODUCTS BOUGHT AND SOLD BETWEEN SEGMENTS CAN ALSO BE ACQUIRED IN

WORLDWIDE MARKETS THAT HAVE SUBSTANTIAL LIQUIDITY, CAPACITY AND TRANSPORTATION CAPABILITIES. ABOUT 40 PERCENT OF THE CORPORATIONS INTERSEGMENT SALES ARE CRUDE OIL PRODUCED BY THE UPSTREAM AND SOLD TO THE DOWNSTREAM. OTHER INTERSEGMENT SALES

INCLUDE THOSE BETWEEN REFINERIES AND CHEMICAL PLANTS RELATED TO RAW MATERIALS, FEEDSTOCKS AND FINISHED PRODUCTS.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

INDEX TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

ALTHOUGH PRICE LEVELS OF CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS MAY RISE OR FALL SIGNIFICANTLY OVER THE SHORT TO

MEDIUM TERM DUE TO POLITICAL EVENTS, OPEC ACTIONS AND OTHER FACTORS, INDUSTRY ECONOMICS OVER THE LONG TERM WILL CONTINUE TO BE DRIVEN BY MARKET SUPPLY AND DEMAND. ACCORDINGLY, THE CORPORATION TESTS THE VIABILITY OF ALL OF ITS ASSETS BASED ON

LONG-TERM PRICE PROJECTIONS. THE CORPORATIONS ASSESSMENT IS THAT ITS OPERATIONS WILL CONTINUE TO BE SUCCESSFUL IN A VARIETY OF MARKET CONDITIONS. THIS IS THE OUTCOME OF DISCIPLINED INVESTMENT AND ASSET MANAGEMENT PROGRAMS. INVESTMENT

OPPORTUNITIES ARE TESTED AGAINST A VARIETY OF MARKET CONDITIONS, INCLUDING LOW-PRICE SCENARIOS. AS A RESULT, INVESTMENTS THAT WOULD SUCCEED ONLY IN HIGHLY FAVORABLE PRICE ENVIRONMENTS ARE SCREENED OUT OF THE INVESTMENT PLAN.

THE CORPORATION HAS HAD AN ACTIVE ASSET MANAGEMENT PROGRAM IN WHICH UNDERPERFORMING ASSETS ARE EITHER IMPROVED TO ACCEPTABLE LEVELS OR CONSIDERED FOR

DIVESTMENT. THE ASSET MANAGEMENT PROGRAM INVOLVES A DISCIPLINED, REGULAR REVIEW TO ENSURE THAT ALL ASSETS ARE CONTRIBUTING TO THE CORPORATIONS STRATEGIC AND FINANCIAL OBJECTIVES. THE RESULT HAS BEEN THE CREATION OF A VERY EFFICIENT CAPITAL

BASE AND HAS MEANT THAT THE CORPORATION HAS SELDOM BEEN REQUIRED TO WRITE DOWN THE CARRYING VALUE OF ASSETS, EVEN DURING PERIODS OF LOW COMMODITY PRICES.

RISK MANAGEMENT

THE CORPORATIONS SIZE, STRONG CAPITAL STRUCTURE, GEOGRAPHIC DIVERSITY AND THE COMPLEMENTARY NATURE OF THE UPSTREAM,

DOWNSTREAM AND CHEMICAL BUSINESSES REDUCE THE CORPORATIONS ENTERPRISE WIDE RISK FROM CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES, CURRENCY RATES AND COMMODITY PRICES. AS A RESULT, THE CORPORATION MAKES LIMITED USE OF DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS TO MITIGATE THE

IMPACT OF SUCH CHANGES. THE CORPORATION DOES NOT ENGAGE IN SPECULATIVE DERIVATIVE ACTIVITIES OR DERIVATIVE TRADING ACTIVITIES NOR DOES IT USE DERIVATIVES WITH LEVERAGED FEATURES. THE CORPORATION MAINTAINS A SYSTEM OF CONTROLS THAT INCLUDES THE

AUTHORIZATION, REPORTING AND MONITORING OF DERIVATIVE ACTIVITY. THE CORPORATIONS LIMITED DERIVATIVE ACTIVITIES POSE NO MATERIAL CREDIT OR MARKET RISKS TO EXXONMOBILS OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL CONDITION OR LIQUIDITY. NOTE 11 ON PAGE 62

SUMMARIZES THE FAIR VALUE OF DERIVATIVES OUTSTANDING AT YEAR-END AND THE GAINS OR LOSSES THAT HAVE BEEN RECOGNIZED IN NET INCOME.

THE

CORPORATION IS EXPOSED TO CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES, PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF ITS SHORT-TERM DEBT AND LONG-TERM DEBT CARRYING FLOATING INTEREST RATES. THE IMPACT OF A 100-BASIS-POINT CHANGE IN INTEREST RATES AFFECTING THE CORPORATIONS DEBT

WOULD NOT BE MATERIAL TO EARNINGS, CASH FLOW OR FAIR VALUE. THE CORPORATIONS CASH BALANCES EXCEEDED TOTAL DEBT AT YEAR-END 2005 AND 2004.

THE CORPORATION CONDUCTS BUSINESS IN MANY FOREIGN CURRENCIES AND IS SUBJECT TO EXCHANGE RATE RISK ON CASH FLOWS RELATED TO SALES, EXPENSES, FINANCING AND INVESTMENT TRANSACTIONS. THE IMPACTS OF FLUCTUATIONS IN EXCHANGE RATES ON

EXXONMOBILS GEOGRAPHICALLY AND FUNCTIONALLY DIVERSE OPERATIONS ARE VARIED AND OFTEN OFFSETTING IN AMOUNT. THE CORPORATION MAKES LIMITED USE OF CURRENCY EXCHANGE CONTRACTS, COMMODITY FORWARDS, SWAPS AND FUTURES CONTRACTS TO MITIGATE THE IMPACT

OF CHANGES IN CURRENCY VALUES AND COMMODITY PRICES. EXPOSURES RELATED TO THE CORPORATIONS LIMITED USE OF THE ABOVE CONTRACTS ARE NOT MATERIAL.

INFLATION AND OTHER UNCERTAINTIES

THE GENERAL RATE OF INFLATION IN MOST MAJOR COUNTRIES OF OPERATION HAS BEEN RELATIVELY LOW IN RECENT

YEARS, AND THE ASSOCIATED IMPACT ON COSTS HAS BEEN COUNTERED BY COST REDUCTIONS FROM EFFICIENCY AND PRODUCTIVITY IMPROVEMENTS.

RECENTLY ISSUED STATEMENTS OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

SHARE-BASED PAYMENT

IN DECEMBER 2004, THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD (FASB) ISSUED A REVISED STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS NO. 123 (FAS 123R), SHARE-BASED

PAYMENT. FAS 123R REQUIRES COMPENSATION COSTS RELATED TO SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS TO BE RECOGNIZED IN THE INCOME STATEMENT OVER THE REQUISITE SERVICE PERIOD. THE AMOUNT OF THE COMPENSATION COST WILL BE MEASURED BASED ON THE GRANT-DATE FAIR VALUE

OF THE INSTRUMENT ISSUED. FAS 123R IS EFFECTIVE FOR THE CORPORATION AS OF JANUARY 1, 2006, FOR AWARDS GRANTED OR MODIFIED AFTER THAT DATE AND FOR AWARDS GRANTED PRIOR TO THAT DATE THAT HAVE NOT VESTED. IN 2003, THE CORPORATION ADOPTED A POLICY

OF EXPENSING ALL SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS THAT IS CONSISTENT WITH THE PROVISIONS OF FAS 123R, AND ALL PRIOR YEAR OUTSTANDING STOCK OPTION AWARDS HAVE VESTED. FAS 123R WILL THEREFORE NOT MATERIALLY CHANGE THE CORPORATIONS EXISTING ACCOUNTING

PRACTICES OR THE AMOUNT OF SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS.

THE CUMULATIVE COMPENSATION

EXPENSE ASSOCIATED WITH SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS MADE IN 2005, 2004 AND 2003 HAS BEEN RECOGNIZED IN THE INCOME STATEMENT USING THE NOMINAL VESTING PERIOD APPROACH. THE FULL COST OF AWARDS GIVEN TO EMPLOYEES WHO HAVE RETIRED BEFORE THE END OF

THE VESTING PERIOD HAS BEEN EXPENSED. THE USE OF A NON-SUBSTANTIVE VESTING PERIOD APPROACH BASED ON THE RETIREMENT ELIGIBILITY AGE, WOULD NOT BE SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT FROM THE NOMINAL VESTING PERIOD APPROACH. THE NON-SUBSTANTIVE

VESTING PERIOD APPROACH WILL BE APPLICABLE TO GRANTS MADE AFTER THE ADOPTION OF FAS 123R ON JANUARY 1, 2006.

ACCOUNTING FOR PURCHASES AND SALES OF

INVENTORY WITH THE SAME COUNTERPARTY

AT ITS SEPTEMBER 2005 MEETING, THE EMERGING ISSUES TASK FORCE (EITF) REACHED A CONSENSUS ON ISSUE NO. 04-13,

ACCOUNTING FOR PURCHASES AND SALES OF INVENTORY WITH THE SAME COUNTERPARTY. THIS ISSUE ADDRESSES THE QUESTION OF WHEN IT IS APPROPRIATE TO MEASURE PURCHASES AND SALES OF INVENTORY AT FAIR VALUE AND RECORD THEM IN COST OF SALES AND

REVENUES AND WHEN THEY SHOULD BE RECORDED AS EXCHANGES MEASURED AT THE BOOK VALUE OF THE ITEM SOLD. THE EITF CONCLUDED THAT PURCHASES AND SALES OF INVENTORY WITH THE SAME COUNTERPARTY THAT ARE ENTERED INTO IN CONTEMPLATION OF ONE ANOTHER SHOULD BE

COMBINED AND RECORDED AS EXCHANGES MEASURED AT THE BOOK VALUE OF THE ITEM SOLD.

THE CORPORATION RECORDS IN REVENUES CERTAIN CRUDE OIL,

NATURAL GAS, PETROLEUM PRODUCT AND CHEMICAL SALES WHERE THE CORPORATION CONTEMPORANEOUSLY NEGOTIATED PURCHASES WITH THE SAME COUNTERPARTY. THE PURCHASES ARE RECORDED IN CRUDE OIL AND PRODUCT PURCHASES. THESE TRANSACTIONS ARE COMMONLY CALLED

BUY/SELL TRANSACTIONS AND ARE USED TO ENSURE THAT THE RIGHT CRUDE OIL IS AVAILABLE TO THE CORPORATIONS REFINERIES AT THE RIGHT TIME AND THAT APPROPRIATE PRODUCTS ARE AVAILABLE

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

TO MEET CUSTOMER DEMAND. THE CORPORATIONS ACCOUNTING TREATMENT FOR THESE BUY/SELL TRANSACTIONS IS CONSISTENT WITH LONG STANDING INDUSTRY PRACTICE. THE EITF

CONSENSUS WILL RESULT IN THE CORPORATIONS ACCOUNTS SALES AND OTHER OPERATING REVENUE AND CRUDE OIL AND PRODUCT PURCHASES ON THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF INCOME BEING REDUCED BY ASSOCIATED AMOUNTS WITH NO IMPACT ON NET

INCOME. ALL OPERATING SEGMENTS WILL BE AFFECTED BY THIS CHANGE, BUT THE LARGEST IMPACTS ARE IN THE DOWNSTREAM. THE EITF CONSENSUS WILL BECOME EFFECTIVE BEGINNING NO LATER THAN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2006.

THE PURCHASE/SALE AMOUNTS INCLUDED IN REVENUE FOR 2005, 2004 AND 2003 ARE SHOWN IN NOTE 1 ON PAGE 52.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

THE CORPORATIONS ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL REPORTING FAIRLY REFLECT ITS STRAIGHTFORWARD

BUSINESS MODEL INVOLVING THE EXTRACTING, REFINING AND MARKETING OF HYDROCARBONS AND HYDROCARBON-BASED PRODUCTS. THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN CONFORMITY WITH U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES (GAAP) REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO

MAKE ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS THAT AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS, LIABILITIES, REVENUES AND EXPENSES AND THE DISCLOSURE OF CONTINGENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. THE FOLLOWING SUMMARY PROVIDES FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT THE CRITICAL ACCOUNTING

POLICIES AND THE JUDGMENTS THAT ARE MADE BY THE CORPORATION IN THE APPLICATION OF THOSE POLICIES.

OIL AND GAS RESERVES

EVALUATIONS OF OIL AND GAS RESERVES ARE IMPORTANT TO THE EFFECTIVE MANAGEMENT OF UPSTREAM ASSETS. THEY ARE INTEGRAL TO MAKING INVESTMENT DECISIONS ABOUT OIL AND GAS

PROPERTIES SUCH AS WHETHER DEVELOPMENT SHOULD PROCEED OR ENHANCED RECOVERY METHODS SHOULD BE UNDERTAKEN. OIL AND GAS RESERVE QUANTITIES ARE ALSO USED AS THE BASIS FOR CALCULATING UNIT-OF-PRODUCTION DEPRECIATION RATES AND FOR EVALUATING IMPAIRMENT.

OIL AND GAS RESERVES ARE DIVIDED BETWEEN PROVED AND UNPROVED RESERVES. PROVED RESERVES ARE THE ESTIMATED QUANTITIES OF CRUDE OIL, NATURAL GAS AND NATURAL GAS LIQUIDS THAT GEOLOGICAL AND ENGINEERING DATA DEMONSTRATE WITH REASONABLE CERTAINTY TO BE

RECOVERABLE IN FUTURE YEARS FROM KNOWN RESERVOIRS UNDER EXISTING ECONOMIC AND OPERATING CONDITIONS; I.E., PRICES AND COSTS AS OF THE DATE THE ESTIMATE IS MADE. UNPROVED RESERVES ARE THOSE WITH LESS THAN REASONABLE CERTAINTY OF RECOVERABILITY AND

INCLUDE PROBABLE RESERVES. PROBABLE RESERVES ARE RESERVES THAT ARE MORE LIKELY TO BE RECOVERED THAN NOT.

THE ESTIMATION OF PROVED

RESERVES, WHICH IS BASED ON THE REQUIREMENT OF REASONABLE CERTAINTY, IS AN ONGOING PROCESS BASED ON RIGOROUS TECHNICAL EVALUATIONS, COMMERCIAL AND MARKET ASSESSMENT, AND DETAILED ANALYSIS OF WELL INFORMATION SUCH AS FLOW RATES AND RESERVOIR PRESSURE

DECLINES. THE ESTIMATION OF PROVED RESERVES IS CONTROLLED BY THE CORPORATION THROUGH LONG-STANDING APPROVAL GUIDELINES. RESERVE CHANGES ARE MADE WITHIN A WELL-ESTABLISHED, DISCIPLINED PROCESS DRIVEN BY SENIOR LEVEL GEOSCIENCE AND ENGINEERING

PROFESSIONALS (ASSISTED BY A CENTRAL RESERVES GROUP WITH SIGNIFICANT TECHNICAL EXPERIENCE) CULMINATING IN REVIEWS WITH AND APPROVAL BY SENIOR MANAGEMENT. NOTABLY, NO EMPLOYEE IS COMPENSATED BASED ON THE LEVEL OF PROVED RESERVE BOOKINGS.

KEY FEATURES OF THE RESERVES ESTIMATION PROCESS INCLUDE.



RIGOROUS PEER-REVIEWED TECHNICAL EVALUATIONS AND ANALYSIS OF WELL AND FIELD PERFORMANCE INFORMATION (SUCH AS FLOW RATES AND RESERVOIR PRESSURE DECLINES), AND



A REQUIREMENT THAT MANAGEMENT MAKE SIGNIFICANT FUNDING COMMITMENTS TOWARD THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE RESERVES PRIOR TO BOOKING.

ALTHOUGH THE CORPORATION IS REASONABLY CERTAIN THAT PROVED RESERVES WILL BE PRODUCED, THE TIMING AND AMOUNT RECOVERED CAN BE AFFECTED BY A NUMBER OF

FACTORS INCLUDING COMPLETION OF DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS, RESERVOIR PERFORMANCE, REGULATORY APPROVALS AND SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN LONG-TERM OIL AND GAS PRICE LEVELS.

PROVED RESERVES CAN BE FURTHER SUBDIVIDED INTO DEVELOPED AND UNDEVELOPED RESERVES. THE PERCENTAGE OF PROVED DEVELOPED RESERVES HAS REMAINED RELATIVELY STABLE OVER THE PAST FIVE YEARS AT OVER 60 PERCENT OF TOTAL PROVED

RESERVES (INCLUDING BOTH CONSOLIDATED AND EQUITY COMPANY RESERVES), INDICATING THAT PROVED RESERVES ARE CONSISTENTLY MOVED FROM UNDEVELOPED TO DEVELOPED STATUS. OVER TIME, THESE UNDEVELOPED RESERVES WILL BE RECLASSIFIED TO THE DEVELOPED CATEGORY AS

NEW WELLS ARE DRILLED, EXISTING WELLS ARE RECOMPLETED AND/OR FACILITIES TO COLLECT AND DELIVER THE PRODUCTION FROM EXISTING AND FUTURE WELLS ARE INSTALLED. MAJOR DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS TYPICALLY TAKE TWO TO FOUR YEARS FROM THE TIME OF RECORDING PROVED

RESERVES TO THE START OF PRODUCTION FROM THESE RESERVES.

BASED ON REGULATORY GUIDANCE, THE CORPORATION HAS REPORTED 2004 AND 2005 RESERVES

ON THE BASIS OF DECEMBER 31 PRICES AND COSTS (YEAR-END PRICES).

THE USE OF YEAR-END

PRICES FOR RESERVES ESTIMATION INTRODUCES SHORT-TERM PRICE VOLATILITY INTO THE PROCESS SINCE ANNUAL ADJUSTMENTS ARE REQUIRED BASED ON PRICES OCCURRING ON A SINGLE DAY. THE CORPORATION BELIEVES THAT THIS APPROACH IS INCONSISTENT WITH THE LONG-TERM

NATURE OF THE UPSTREAM BUSINESS WHERE PRODUCTION FROM INDIVIDUAL PROJECTS OFTEN SPANS MULTIPLE DECADES. THE USE OF PRICES FROM A SINGLE DATE IS NOT RELEVANT TO THE INVESTMENT DECISIONS MADE BY THE CORPORATION AND ANNUAL VARIATIONS IN RESERVES BASED

ON SUCH YEAR-END PRICES ARE NOT OF CONSEQUENCE TO HOW THE BUSINESS IS ACTUALLY MANAGED.

REVISIONS CAN

INCLUDE UPWARD OR DOWNWARD CHANGES IN PREVIOUSLY ESTIMATED VOLUMES OF PROVED RESERVES FOR EXISTING FIELDS DUE TO THE EVALUATION OR RE-EVALUATION OF (1) ALREADY AVAILABLE GEOLOGIC, RESERVOIR OR PRODUCTION DATA, OR (2) NEW GEOLOGIC,

RESERVOIR OR PRODUCTION DATA, OR (3) CHANGES TO UNDERLYING PRICE ASSUMPTIONS USED IN THE DETERMINATION OF RESERVES. THIS CATEGORY CAN ALSO INCLUDE CHANGES ASSOCIATED WITH THE PERFORMANCE OF IMPROVED RECOVERY PROJECTS AND SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN

EITHER DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY OR PRODUCTION EQUIPMENT/FACILITY CAPACITY.

THE CORPORATION USES THE

SUCCESSFUL EFFORTS METHOD TO ACCOUNT FOR ITS EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION ACTIVITIES. UNDER THIS METHOD, COSTS ARE ACCUMULATED ON A FIELD-BY-FIELD BASIS WITH CERTAIN EXPLORATORY EXPENDITURES AND EXPLORATORY DRY HOLES BEING EXPENSED AS

INCURRED. COSTS OF PRODUCTIVE WELLS AND DEVELOPMENT DRY HOLES ARE CAPITALIZED AND AMORTIZED ON THE UNIT-OF-PRODUCTION METHOD FOR EACH FIELD. THE CORPORATION USES THIS ACCOUNTING POLICY INSTEAD OF THE FULL COST METHOD BECAUSE IT PROVIDES

A MORE TIMELY ACCOUNTING OF THE SUCCESS OR FAILURE OF THE

42

TABLE OF CONTENTS

INDEX TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

CORPORATIONS EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION ACTIVITIES. IF THE FULL COST METHOD WERE USED, ALL COSTS WOULD BE

CAPITALIZED AND DEPRECIATED ON A COUNTRY-BY-COUNTRY BASIS. THE CAPITALIZED COSTS WOULD BE SUBJECT TO AN IMPAIRMENT TEST BY COUNTRY. THE FULL COST METHOD WOULD TEND TO DELAY THE EXPENSE RECOGNITION OF UNSUCCESSFUL PROJECTS.

IMPACT OF OIL AND GAS RESERVES ON DEPRECIATION.

THE CALCULATION OF UNIT-OF-PRODUCTION DEPRECIATION IS A CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATE THAT MEASURES THE

DEPRECIATION OF UPSTREAM ASSETS. IT IS THE RATIO OF (1) ACTUAL VOLUMES PRODUCED TO (2) TOTAL PROVED DEVELOPED RESERVES (THOSE PROVED RESERVES RECOVERABLE THROUGH EXISTING WELLS WITH EXISTING EQUIPMENT AND OPERATING METHODS) APPLIED TO THE

(3) ASSET COST. THE VOLUMES PRODUCED AND ASSET COST ARE KNOWN AND, WHILE PROVED DEVELOPED RESERVES HAVE A HIGH PROBABILITY OF RECOVERABILITY, THEY ARE BASED ON ESTIMATES THAT ARE SUBJECT TO SOME VARIABILITY. THIS VARIABILITY HAS GENERALLY

RESULTED IN NET UPWARD REVISIONS OF PROVED RESERVES IN EXISTING FIELDS, AS MORE INFORMATION BECOMES AVAILABLE THROUGH RESEARCH AND ACTUAL PRODUCTION LEVELS. WHILE THE UPWARD REVISIONS THE CORPORATION HAS MADE IN THE PAST ARE AN INDICATOR OF

VARIABILITY, THEY HAVE HAD A VERY SMALL IMPACT ON THE UNIT-OF-PRODUCTION RATES BECAUSE THEY HAVE BEEN SMALL COMPARED TO THE LARGE RESERVES BASE.

IMPACT

OF OIL AND GAS RESERVES AND PRICES ON TESTING FOR IMPAIRMENT.

PROVED OIL AND GAS PROPERTIES HELD AND USED BY THE CORPORATION ARE REVIEWED FOR IMPAIRMENT WHENEVER EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THAT THE CARRYING AMOUNTS MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE.

ASSETS ARE GROUPED AT THE LOWEST LEVEL FOR WHICH THERE ARE IDENTIFIABLE CASH FLOWS THAT ARE LARGELY INDEPENDENT OF THE CASH FLOWS OF OTHER GROUPS OF ASSETS.

THE CORPORATION ESTIMATES THE FUTURE UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS OF THE AFFECTED PROPERTIES TO JUDGE THE RECOVERABILITY OF CARRYING AMOUNTS. IN GENERAL, ANALYSES ARE BASED ON PROVED RESERVES. WHERE PROBABLE RESERVES

EXIST, AN APPROPRIATELY RISK-ADJUSTED AMOUNT OF THESE RESERVES MAY BE INCLUDED IN THE IMPAIRMENT EVALUATION. AN ASSET WOULD BE IMPAIRED IF THE UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS WERE LESS THAN ITS CARRYING VALUE. IMPAIRMENTS ARE MEASURED BY THE AMOUNT BY WHICH

THE CARRYING VALUE EXCEEDS ITS FAIR VALUE.

THE CORPORATION PERFORMS ASSET VALUATION ANALYSES ON AN ONGOING BASIS AS A PART OF ITS ASSET

MANAGEMENT PROGRAM. THESE ANALYSES MONITOR THE PERFORMANCE OF ASSETS AGAINST CORPORATE OBJECTIVES. THEY ALSO ASSIST THE CORPORATION IN ASSESSING WHETHER THE CARRYING AMOUNTS OF ANY OF ITS ASSETS MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE. IN ADDITION TO ESTIMATING OIL

AND GAS RESERVE VOLUMES IN CONDUCTING THESE ANALYSES, IT IS ALSO NECESSARY TO ESTIMATE FUTURE OIL AND GAS PRICES. TRIGGER EVENTS FOR IMPAIRMENT EVALUATION INCLUDE A SIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN CURRENT AND PROJECTED PRICES OR RESERVE VOLUMES, AN

ACCUMULATION OF PROJECT COSTS SIGNIFICANTLY IN EXCESS OF THE AMOUNT ORIGINALLY EXPECTED, AND HISTORICAL AND CURRENT OPERATING LOSSES.

IN

GENERAL, THE CORPORATION DOES NOT VIEW TEMPORARILY LOW OIL PRICES AS A TRIGGER EVENT FOR CONDUCTING THE IMPAIRMENT TESTS. THE MARKETS FOR CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS HAVE A HISTORY OF SIGNIFICANT PRICE VOLATILITY. ALTHOUGH PRICES WILL OCCASIONALLY

DROP PRECIPITOUSLY, INDUSTRY PRICES OVER THE LONG TERM WILL CONTINUE TO BE DRIVEN BY MARKET SUPPLY AND DEMAND. ON THE SUPPLY SIDE, INDUSTRY PRODUCTION FROM MATURE FIELDS IS DECLINING, BUT THIS IS BEING OFFSET BY PRODUCTION FROM NEW DISCOVERIES AND

FIELD DEVELOPMENTS. OPEC PRODUCTION POLICIES ALSO HAVE AN IMPACT ON WORLD OIL SUPPLIES. THE DEMAND SIDE IS LARGELY A FUNCTION OF GLOBAL ECONOMIC GROWTH. THE RELATIVE GROWTH/DECLINE IN SUPPLY VERSUS DEMAND WILL DETERMINE INDUSTRY PRICES OVER THE LONG

TERM AND THESE CANNOT BE ACCURATELY PREDICTED. ACCORDINGLY, ANY IMPAIRMENT TESTS THAT THE CORPORATION PERFORMS MAKE USE OF THE CORPORATIONS LONG-TERM PRICE ASSUMPTIONS FOR THE CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS MARKETS, PETROLEUM PRODUCTS AND

CHEMICALS. THESE ARE THE SAME PRICE ASSUMPTIONS THAT ARE USED IN THE CORPORATIONS ANNUAL PLANNING AND BUDGETING PROCESSES AND ARE ALSO USED FOR CAPITAL INVESTMENT DECISIONS. THE CORPORATE PLAN IS A FUNDAMENTAL ANNUAL MANAGEMENT PROCESS THAT IS

THE BASIS FOR SETTING NEAR-TERM RISK-ASSESSED OPERATING AND CAPITAL OBJECTIVES IN ADDITION TO PROVIDING THE LONGER-TERM ECONOMIC ASSUMPTIONS USED FOR INVESTMENT EVALUATION PURPOSES. VOLUMES ARE BASED ON INDIVIDUAL FIELD PRODUCTION PROFILES, WHICH

ARE ALSO UPDATED ANNUALLY. PRICES FOR NATURAL GAS AND OTHER PRODUCTS ARE BASED ON CORPORATE PLAN ASSUMPTIONS DEVELOPED ANNUALLY BY MAJOR REGION AND USED FOR INVESTMENT EVALUATION PURPOSES. CASH FLOW ESTIMATES FOR IMPAIRMENT TESTING EXCLUDE THE USE

OF DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS.

SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION REGARDING OIL AND GAS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, CAPITALIZED COSTS AND RESERVES CAN BE

FOUND ON PAGES 76 TO 85. THE STANDARDIZED MEASURE OF DISCOUNTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS ON PAGES 84 AND 85 IS BASED ON THE YEAR-END 2005 PRICE APPLIED FOR ALL FUTURE YEARS, AS REQUIRED UNDER STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS NO. 69 (FAS

69). FUTURE PRICES USED FOR ANY IMPAIRMENT TESTS WILL VARY FROM THE ONE USED IN THE FAS 69 DISCLOSURE, AND COULD BE LOWER OR HIGHER FOR ANY GIVEN YEAR.

SUSPENDED EXPLORATORY WELL COSTS

THE CORPORATION CARRIES AS AN ASSET EXPLORATORY WELL COSTS WHEN THE WELL HAS FOUND A SUFFICIENT QUANTITY

OF RESERVES TO JUSTIFY ITS COMPLETION AS A PRODUCING WELL AND WHERE THE CORPORATION IS MAKING SUFFICIENT PROGRESS ASSESSING THE RESERVES AND THE ECONOMIC AND OPERATING VIABILITY OF THE PROJECT. EXPLORATORY WELL COSTS NOT MEETING THESE CRITERIA ARE

CHARGED TO EXPENSE. ASSESSING WHETHER A PROJECT HAS MADE SUFFICIENT PROGRESS IS A SUBJECTIVE AREA AND REQUIRES CAREFUL CONSIDERATION OF THE RELEVANT FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES. THE FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES THAT SUPPORT CONTINUED CAPITALIZATION OF

SUSPENDED WELLS AS OF YEAR-END 2005 ARE DISCLOSED IN NOTE 2 TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ON PAGE 55.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

CONSOLIDATIONS

THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

INCLUDE THE ACCOUNTS OF THOSE SIGNIFICANT SUBSIDIARIES THAT THE CORPORATION CONTROLS. THEY ALSO INCLUDE THE CORPORATIONS UNDIVIDED INTERESTS IN UPSTREAM ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. AMOUNTS REPRESENTING THE CORPORATIONS PERCENTAGE INTEREST IN

THE UNDERLYING NET ASSETS OF OTHER SIGNIFICANT AFFILIATES THAT IT DOES NOT CONTROL, BUT EXERCISES SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE, ARE INCLUDED IN INVESTMENTS AND ADVANCES; THE CORPORATIONS SHARE OF THE NET INCOME OF THESE COMPANIES IS

INCLUDED IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF INCOME CAPTION INCOME FROM EQUITY AFFILIATES. THE ACCOUNTING FOR THESE NONCONSOLIDATED COMPANIES IS REFERRED TO AS THE EQUITY METHOD OF ACCOUNTING.

MAJORITY OWNERSHIP IS NORMALLY THE INDICATOR OF CONTROL THAT IS THE BASIS ON WHICH SUBSIDIARIES ARE CONSOLIDATED. HOWEVER, CERTAIN FACTORS MAY INDICATE

THAT A MAJORITY-OWNED INVESTMENT IS NOT CONTROLLED AND THEREFORE SHOULD BE ACCOUNTED FOR USING THE EQUITY METHOD OF ACCOUNTING. THESE FACTORS OCCUR WHERE THE MINORITY SHAREHOLDERS ARE GRANTED BY LAW OR BY CONTRACT SUBSTANTIVE PARTICIPATING RIGHTS.

THESE INCLUDE THE RIGHT TO APPROVE OPERATING POLICIES, EXPENSE BUDGETS, FINANCING AND INVESTMENT PLANS AND MANAGEMENT COMPENSATION AND SUCCESSION PLANS.

THE CORPORATION CONSOLIDATES CERTAIN AFFILIATES IDENTIFIED AS VARIABLE-INTEREST ENTITIES IN WHICH IT HAS LESS THAN A MAJORITY OWNERSHIP, BECAUSE OF GUARANTEES OR OTHER ARRANGEMENTS THAT CREATE MAJORITY ECONOMIC

INTERESTS IN THOSE AFFILIATES THAT ARE GREATER THAN THE CORPORATIONS VOTING INTERESTS.

ADDITIONAL DISCLOSURES OF SUMMARY BALANCE

SHEET AND INCOME INFORMATION FOR THOSE SUBSIDIARIES ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER THE EQUITY METHOD OF ACCOUNTING CAN BE FOUND IN NOTE 6 ON PAGE 59. THE CORPORATION BELIEVES THIS TO BE IMPORTANT INFORMATION NECESSARY TO A FULL UNDERSTANDING OF THE

CORPORATIONS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

INVESTMENTS IN COMPANIES THAT ARE PARTIALLY OWNED BY THE CORPORATION ARE INTEGRAL TO THE

CORPORATIONS OPERATIONS. IN SOME CASES THEY SERVE TO BALANCE WORLDWIDE RISKS AND IN OTHERS THEY PROVIDE THE ONLY AVAILABLE MEANS OF ENTRY INTO A PARTICULAR MARKET OR AREA OF INTEREST. THE OTHER PARTIES WHO ALSO HAVE AN EQUITY INTEREST IN THESE

COMPANIES ARE EITHER INDEPENDENT THIRD PARTIES OR HOST GOVERNMENTS THAT SHARE IN THE BUSINESS RESULTS ACCORDING TO THEIR PERCENTAGE OWNERSHIP. THE CORPORATION DOES NOT INVEST IN THESE COMPANIES IN ORDER TO REMOVE LIABILITIES FROM ITS BALANCE SHEET.

IN FACT, THE CORPORATION HAS LONG BEEN ON RECORD SUPPORTING AN ALTERNATIVE ACCOUNTING METHOD THAT WOULD REQUIRE EACH INVESTOR TO CONSOLIDATE ITS PERCENTAGE SHARE OF ALL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES IN THESE PARTIALLY OWNED COMPANIES RATHER THAN ONLY ITS

PERCENTAGE IN THE NET EQUITY. THIS METHOD OF ACCOUNTING FOR INVESTMENTS IN PARTIALLY OWNED COMPANIES IS NOT PERMITTED BY GAAP EXCEPT WHERE THE INVESTMENTS ARE IN THE DIRECT OWNERSHIP OF A SHARE OF UPSTREAM ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. HOWEVER, FOR

PURPOSES OF CALCULATING RETURN ON AVERAGE CAPITAL EMPLOYED, WHICH IS NOT COVERED BY GAAP STANDARDS, THE CORPORATION INCLUDES ITS SHARE OF DEBT OF THESE PARTIALLY OWNED COMPANIES IN THE DETERMINATION OF AVERAGE CAPITAL EMPLOYED.

ANNUITY BENEFITS

THE CORPORATION AND ITS AFFILIATES

SPONSOR APPROXIMATELY 100 DEFINED-BENEFIT (PENSION) PLANS IN ABOUT 50 COUNTRIES. THE FUNDING ARRANGEMENT FOR EACH PLAN DEPENDS ON THE PREVAILING PRACTICES AND REGULATIONS OF THE COUNTRIES WHERE THE CORPORATION OPERATES. NOTE 15, PAGES 70 TO 73,

PROVIDES DETAILS ON PENSION OBLIGATIONS, FUND ASSETS AND PENSION EXPENSE.

SOME OF THESE PLANS (PRIMARILY NON-U.S.) PROVIDE PENSION

BENEFITS THAT ARE PAID DIRECTLY BY THEIR SPONSORING AFFILIATES OUT OF CORPORATE CASH FLOW RATHER THAN A SEPARATE PENSION FUND. BOOK RESERVES ARE ESTABLISHED FOR THESE PLANS BECAUSE TAX CONVENTIONS AND REGULATORY PRACTICES DO NOT ENCOURAGE ADVANCE

FUNDING. THE PORTION OF THE PENSION COST ATTRIBUTABLE TO EMPLOYEE SERVICE IS EXPENSED AS SERVICES ARE RENDERED. THE PORTION ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE INCREASE IN PENSION OBLIGATIONS DUE TO THE PASSAGE OF TIME IS EXPENSED OVER THE TERM OF THE OBLIGATIONS,

WHICH ENDS WHEN ALL BENEFITS ARE PAID. THE PRIMARY DIFFERENCE IN PENSION EXPENSE FOR UNFUNDED VERSUS FUNDED PLANS IS THAT PENSION EXPENSE FOR FUNDED PLANS ALSO INCLUDES A CREDIT FOR THE EXPECTED LONG-TERM RETURN ON FUND ASSETS.

FOR FUNDED PLANS, INCLUDING MANY IN THE U.S., PENSION OBLIGATIONS ARE FINANCED IN ADVANCE THROUGH SEGREGATED ASSETS OR INSURANCE ARRANGEMENTS. THESE

PLANS ARE MANAGED IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE REQUIREMENTS OF GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORITIES, AND MEET OR EXCEED REQUIRED FUNDING LEVELS AS MEASURED BY RELEVANT ACTUARIAL AND GOVERNMENT STANDARDS AT THE MANDATED MEASUREMENT DATES. IN DETERMINING LIABILITIES

AND REQUIRED CONTRIBUTIONS, THESE STANDARDS OFTEN REQUIRE APPROACHES AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT DIFFER FROM THOSE USED FOR ACCOUNTING PURPOSES.

THE CORPORATION WILL CONTINUE TO MAKE CONTRIBUTIONS TO THESE FUNDED PLANS AS NECESSARY. ALL DEFINED-BENEFIT PENSION OBLIGATIONS, REGARDLESS OF THE FUNDING STATUS OF THE UNDERLYING PLANS, ARE FULLY SUPPORTED BY THE FINANCIAL STRENGTH OF THE

CORPORATION OR THE RESPECTIVE SPONSORING AFFILIATE.

PENSION ACCOUNTING REQUIRES EXPLICIT ASSUMPTIONS REGARDING, AMONG OTHERS, THE

LONG-TERM EXPECTED EARNINGS RATE ON FUND ASSETS, THE DISCOUNT RATE FOR THE BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS, AND THE LONG-TERM RATE FOR FUTURE SALARY INCREASES. ALL THE PENSION ASSUMPTIONS ARE REVIEWED ANNUALLY BY OUTSIDE ACTUARIES AND SENIOR MANAGEMENT. THESE

ASSUMPTIONS ARE ADJUSTED ONLY AS APPROPRIATE TO REFLECT CHANGES IN MARKET RATES AND OUTLOOK. FOR EXAMPLE, THE LONG-TERM EXPECTED EARNINGS RATE ON U.S. PENSION PLAN ASSETS IN 2005 WAS 9.0 PERCENT. THIS COMPARES TO AN ACTUAL RATE OF RETURN OVER THE

PAST DECADE OF 11 PERCENT. THE CORPORATION ESTABLISHES THE LONG-TERM EXPECTED RATE OF RETURN BY DEVELOPING A FORWARD-LOOKING, LONG-TERM RETURN ASSUMPTION FOR EACH PENSION FUND ASSET CLASS, TAKING INTO ACCOUNT FACTORS SUCH AS THE EXPECTED REAL RETURN

FOR THE SPECIFIC ASSET CLASS AND INFLATION. A SINGLE, LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN IS THEN CALCULATED AS THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE OF THE TARGET ASSET ALLOCATION AND THE LONG-TERM RETURN ASSUMPTION FOR EACH ASSET CLASS. A WORLDWIDE REDUCTION OF 0.5 PERCENT

IN THE PENSION FUND EARNINGS RATE WOULD INCREASE ANNUAL PENSION EXPENSE BY APPROXIMATELY $95 MILLION BEFORE TAX.

44

TABLE OF CONTENTS

INDEX TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

DIFFERENCES BETWEEN ACTUAL RETURNS ON FUND ASSETS VERSUS THE LONG-TERM EXPECTED RETURN ARE NOT

RECORDED IN THE YEAR THAT THE DIFFERENCE OCCURS, BUT RATHER ARE AMORTIZED IN PENSION EXPENSE, ALONG WITH OTHER ACTUARIAL GAINS AND LOSSES, OVER THE EXPECTED REMAINING SERVICE LIFE OF EMPLOYEES.

LITIGATION AND OTHER CONTINGENCIES

A VARIETY OF CLAIMS HAVE BEEN

MADE AGAINST THE CORPORATION AND CERTAIN OF ITS CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES IN A NUMBER OF PENDING LAWSUITS AND TAX DISPUTES. THESE ARE SUMMARIZED ON PAGES 38 AND 39, AND ARE ALSO INCLUDED IN NOTE 14 ON PAGES 68 AND 69.

GAAP REQUIRES THAT LIABILITIES FOR CONTINGENCIES BE RECORDED WHEN IT IS PROBABLE THAT A LIABILITY HAS BEEN INCURRED BY THE DATE OF THE BALANCE SHEET AND

THAT THE AMOUNT CAN BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED. THESE AMOUNTS ARE NOT REDUCED BY AMOUNTS THAT MAY BE RECOVERED UNDER INSURANCE OR CLAIMS AGAINST THIRD PARTIES, BUT UNDISCOUNTED RECEIVABLES FROM INSURERS OR OTHER THIRD PARTIES MAY BE ACCRUED SEPARATELY.

THE CORPORATION REVISES SUCH ACCRUALS IN LIGHT OF NEW INFORMATION.

SIGNIFICANT MANAGEMENT JUDGMENT IS REQUIRED RELATED TO CONTINGENT

LIABILITIES AND THE OUTCOME OF LITIGATION BECAUSE BOTH ARE DIFFICULT TO PREDICT. HOWEVER, THE CORPORATION HAS BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN DEFENDING LITIGATION IN THE PAST. PAYMENTS HAVE NOT HAD A MATERIALLY ADVERSE EFFECT ON OPERATIONS OR FINANCIAL

CONDITION. IN THE CORPORATIONS EXPERIENCE, LARGE CLAIMS OFTEN DO NOT RESULT IN LARGE AWARDS. LARGE AWARDS ARE OFTEN REVERSED OR SUBSTANTIALLY REDUCED AS A RESULT OF APPEAL OR SETTLEMENT.

FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION

THE METHOD OF TRANSLATING THE FOREIGN

CURRENCY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF THE CORPORATIONS INTERNATIONAL SUBSIDIARIES INTO U.S. DOLLARS IS PRESCRIBED BY GAAP. UNDER THESE PRINCIPLES, IT IS NECESSARY TO SELECT THE FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY OF THESE SUBSIDIARIES. THE FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY IS

THE CURRENCY OF THE PRIMARY ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH THE SUBSIDIARY OPERATES. MANAGEMENT SELECTS THE FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY AFTER EVALUATING THIS ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT. DOWNSTREAM AND CHEMICAL OPERATIONS NORMALLY USE THE LOCAL CURRENCY, EXCEPT IN

HIGHLY INFLATIONARY COUNTRIES, PRIMARILY LATIN AMERICA, AS WELL AS IN SINGAPORE, WHICH USES THE U.S. DOLLAR, BECAUSE IT PREDOMINANTLY SELLS INTO THE U.S. DOLLAR EXPORT MARKET. UPSTREAM OPERATIONS ALSO USE THE LOCAL CURRENCY AS THE FUNCTIONAL

CURRENCY, EXCEPT WHERE CRUDE AND NATURAL GAS PRODUCTION IS PREDOMINANTLY SOLD IN THE EXPORT MARKET IN U.S. DOLLARS. THESE OPERATIONS, WHICH USE THE U.S. DOLLAR AS THEIR FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY, INCLUDE MALAYSIA, INDONESIA, ANGOLA, NIGERIA, EQUATORIAL

GUINEA, RUSSIA AND THE MIDDLE EAST.

FACTORS CONSIDERED BY MANAGEMENT WHEN DETERMINING THE FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY FOR A SUBSIDIARY INCLUDE.

THE CURRENCY USED FOR CASH FLOWS RELATED TO INDIVIDUAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES; THE RESPONSIVENESS OF SALES PRICES TO CHANGES IN EXCHANGE RATES; WHETHER SALES ARE INTO LOCAL MARKETS OR EXPORTED; THE CURRENCY USED TO ACQUIRE RAW MATERIALS, LABOR,

SERVICES AND SUPPLIES; SOURCES OF FINANCING; AND SIGNIFICANCE OF INTERCOMPANY TRANSACTIONS.

MANAGEMENTS REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

MANAGEMENT, INCLUDING THE CORPORATIONS CHIEF

EXECUTIVE OFFICER, PRINCIPAL FINANCIAL OFFICER, AND PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING OFFICER, IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ESTABLISHING AND MAINTAINING ADEQUATE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER THE CORPORATIONS FINANCIAL REPORTING. MANAGEMENT CONDUCTED AN EVALUATION OF THE

EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING BASED ON THE

INTERNAL CONTROL  INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK

ISSUED BY THE COMMITTEE OF SPONSORING ORGANIZATIONS OF THE TREADWAY COMMISSION. BASED ON THIS EVALUATION, MANAGEMENT

CONCLUDED THAT EXXON MOBIL CORPORATIONS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING WAS EFFECTIVE AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2005.

MANAGEMENTS ASSESSMENT OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2005, WAS AUDITED BY PRICEWATERHOUSECOOPERS LLP, AN INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM, AS STATED IN THEIR

REPORT WHICH IS INCLUDED HEREIN.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

TO THE SHAREHOLDERS OF EXXON MOBIL CORPORATION.

WE HAVE COMPLETED INTEGRATED AUDITS OF EXXON MOBIL CORPORATIONS 2005 AND 2004 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND OF ITS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2005, AND AN AUDIT OF

ITS 2003 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE STANDARDS OF THE PUBLIC COMPANY ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BOARD (UNITED STATES). OUR OPINIONS, BASED ON OUR AUDITS, ARE PRESENTED BELOW.

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

IN OUR OPINION, THE ACCOMPANYING

CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS AND THE RELATED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME, SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY AND CASH FLOWS APPEARING ON PAGES 48 TO 75 PRESENT FAIRLY, IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS, THE FINANCIAL POSITION OF EXXON MOBIL CORPORATION AND ITS

SUBSIDIARIES AT DECEMBER 31, 2005, AND 2004, AND THE RESULTS OF THEIR OPERATIONS AND THEIR CASH FLOWS FOR EACH OF THE THREE YEARS IN THE PERIOD ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2005, IN CONFORMITY WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE

UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE CORPORATIONS MANAGEMENT. OUR RESPONSIBILITY IS TO EXPRESS AN OPINION ON THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS BASED ON OUR AUDITS. WE CONDUCTED OUR AUDITS OF THESE

STATEMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE STANDARDS OF THE PUBLIC COMPANY ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BOARD (UNITED STATES). THOSE STANDARDS REQUIRE THAT WE PLAN AND PERFORM THE AUDIT TO OBTAIN REASONABLE ASSURANCE ABOUT WHETHER THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE FREE

OF MATERIAL MISSTATEMENT. AN AUDIT OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDES EXAMINING, ON A TEST BASIS, EVIDENCE SUPPORTING THE AMOUNTS AND DISCLOSURES IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, ASSESSING THE ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES USED AND SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES MADE BY

MANAGEMENT, AND EVALUATING THE OVERALL FINANCIAL STATEMENT PRESENTATION. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR AUDITS PROVIDE A REASONABLE BASIS FOR OUR OPINION.

AS DISCUSSED IN NOTE 8 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, THE CORPORATION CHANGED ITS METHOD OF ACCOUNTING FOR ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS IN 2003.

INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

ALSO, IN OUR OPINION, MANAGEMENTS ASSESSMENT, INCLUDED IN THE ACCOMPANYING MANAGEMENTS REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, THAT THE CORPORATION MAINTAINED EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER

FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2005, BASED ON CRITERIA ESTABLISHED IN

INTERNAL CONTROL  INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK

ISSUED BY THE COMMITTEE OF SPONSORING ORGANIZATIONS OF THE TREADWAY COMMISSION (COSO), IS FAIRLY STATED, IN ALL

MATERIAL RESPECTS, BASED ON THOSE CRITERIA. FURTHERMORE, IN OUR OPINION, THE CORPORATION MAINTAINED, IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS, EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2005, BASED ON CRITERIA ESTABLISHED IN

INTERNAL CONTROL  INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK

ISSUED BY THE COSO. THE CORPORATIONS MANAGEMENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR MAINTAINING EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AND FOR ITS ASSESSMENT OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL

CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING. OUR RESPONSIBILITY IS TO EXPRESS OPINIONS ON MANAGEMENTS ASSESSMENT AND ON THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE CORPORATIONS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING BASED ON OUR AUDIT. WE CONDUCTED OUR AUDIT OF

INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE STANDARDS OF THE PUBLIC COMPANY ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BOARD (UNITED STATES). THOSE STANDARDS REQUIRE THAT WE PLAN AND PERFORM THE AUDIT TO OBTAIN REASONABLE ASSURANCE ABOUT WHETHER

EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING WAS MAINTAINED IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS. AN AUDIT OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING INCLUDES OBTAINING AN UNDERSTANDING OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, EVALUATING

MANAGEMENTS ASSESSMENT, TESTING AND EVALUATING THE DESIGN AND OPERATING EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL CONTROL, AND PERFORMING SUCH OTHER PROCEDURES AS WE CONSIDER NECESSARY IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR AUDIT PROVIDES A REASONABLE

BASIS FOR OUR OPINIONS.

A COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING IS A PROCESS DESIGNED TO PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE

REGARDING THE RELIABILITY OF FINANCIAL REPORTING AND THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR EXTERNAL PURPOSES IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES. A COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING INCLUDES THOSE

POLICIES AND PROCEDURES THAT (I) PERTAIN TO THE MAINTENANCE OF RECORDS THAT, IN REASONABLE DETAIL, ACCURATELY AND FAIRLY REFLECT THE TRANSACTIONS AND DISPOSITIONS OF THE ASSETS OF THE COMPANY; (II) PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE THAT

TRANSACTIONS ARE RECORDED AS NECESSARY TO PERMIT PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES, AND THAT RECEIPTS AND EXPENDITURES OF THE COMPANY ARE BEING MADE ONLY IN ACCORDANCE WITH AUTHORIZATIONS

OF MANAGEMENT AND DIRECTORS OF THE COMPANY; AND (III) PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING PREVENTION OR TIMELY DETECTION OF UNAUTHORIZED ACQUISITION, USE OR DISPOSITION OF THE COMPANYS ASSETS THAT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE

TABLE OF CONTENTS

INDEX TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND THE SUPPORTING AND

SUPPLEMENTAL MATERIAL ARE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE MANAGEMENT OF EXXON MOBIL CORPORATION.

THE CORPORATIONS PRINCIPAL BUSINESS IS

ENERGY, INVOLVING THE WORLDWIDE EXPLORATION, PRODUCTION, TRANSPORTATION AND SALE OF CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS (UPSTREAM) AND THE MANUFACTURE, TRANSPORTATION AND SALE OF PETROLEUM PRODUCTS (DOWNSTREAM). THE CORPORATION IS ALSO A MAJOR WORLDWIDE

MANUFACTURER AND MARKETER OF PETROCHEMICALS (CHEMICAL), AND PARTICIPATES IN ELECTRIC POWER GENERATION (UPSTREAM).

THE PREPARATION OF

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN CONFORMITY WITH U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES (GAAP) REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO MAKE ESTIMATES THAT AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS, LIABILITIES, REVENUES AND EXPENSES AND THE DISCLOSURE OF CONTINGENT ASSETS

AND LIABILITIES. ACTUAL RESULTS COULD DIFFER FROM THESE ESTIMATES. CERTAIN RECLASSIFICATIONS TO PRIOR YEARS HAVE BEEN MADE TO CONFORM TO THE 2005 PRESENTATION.

1. SUMMARY OF ACCOUNTING POLICIES

PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION.

THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDE THE

ACCOUNTS OF THOSE SIGNIFICANT SUBSIDIARIES OWNED DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY WITH MORE THAN 50 PERCENT OF THE VOTING RIGHTS HELD BY THE CORPORATION, AND FOR WHICH OTHER SHAREHOLDERS DO NOT POSSESS THE RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN SIGNIFICANT MANAGEMENT

DECISIONS. THEY ALSO INCLUDE THE CORPORATIONS SHARE OF THE UNDIVIDED INTEREST IN UPSTREAM ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. ADDITIONALLY, THE CORPORATION CONSOLIDATES CERTAIN AFFILIATES IDENTIFIED AS VARIABLE-INTEREST ENTITIES IN WHICH IT HAS LESS THAN

A MAJORITY OWNERSHIP, BECAUSE OF GUARANTEES OR OTHER ARRANGEMENTS THAT CREATE MAJORITY ECONOMIC INTERESTS IN THOSE AFFILIATES THAT ARE GREATER THAN THE CORPORATIONS VOTING INTERESTS.

AMOUNTS REPRESENTING THE CORPORATIONS PERCENTAGE INTEREST IN THE UNDERLYING NET ASSETS OF OTHER SIGNIFICANT SUBSIDIARIES AND

LESS-THAN-MAJORITY-OWNED COMPANIES IN WHICH A SIGNIFICANT OWNERSHIP PERCENTAGE INTEREST IS HELD ARE INCLUDED IN INVESTMENTS AND ADVANCES; THE CORPORATIONS SHARE OF THE NET INCOME OF THESE COMPANIES IS INCLUDED IN THE CONSOLIDATED

STATEMENT OF INCOME CAPTION INCOME FROM EQUITY AFFILIATES. THE CORPORATIONS SHARE OF THE CUMULATIVE FOREIGN EXCHANGE TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENT FOR EQUITY METHOD INVESTMENTS IS REPORTED IN CONSOLIDATED SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY.

EVIDENCE OF LOSS IN VALUE THAT MIGHT INDICATE IMPAIRMENT OF INVESTMENTS IN COMPANIES ACCOUNTED FOR ON THE EQUITY METHOD IS ASSESSED TO DETERMINE IF SUCH EVIDENCE REPRESENTS A LOSS IN VALUE OF THE CORPORATIONS INVESTMENT THAT IS OTHER THAN

TEMPORARY. EXAMPLES OF KEY INDICATORS INCLUDE A HISTORY OF OPERATING LOSSES, A NEGATIVE EARNINGS AND CASH FLOW OUTLOOK, SIGNIFICANT DOWNWARD REVISIONS TO OIL AND GAS RESERVES, AND THE FINANCIAL CONDITION AND PROSPECTS FOR THE INVESTEES

BUSINESS SEGMENT OR GEOGRAPHIC REGION. IF EVIDENCE OF AN OTHER THAN TEMPORARY LOSS IN FAIR VALUE BELOW CARRYING AMOUNT IS DETERMINED, AN IMPAIRMENT IS RECOGNIZED. IN THE ABSENCE OF MARKET PRICES FOR THE INVESTMENT, DISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS ARE USED TO

ASSESS FAIR VALUE.

REVENUE RECOGNITION.

THE CORPORATION GENERALLY SELLS CRUDE OIL, NATURAL GAS AND PETROLEUM AND CHEMICAL PRODUCTS UNDER SHORT-TERM

AGREEMENTS AT PREVAILING MARKET PRICES. IN SOME CASES (E.G., NATURAL GAS), PRODUCTS MAY BE SOLD UNDER LONG-TERM AGREEMENTS, WITH PERIODIC PRICE ADJUSTMENTS. IN ALL CASES, REVENUES ARE RECOGNIZED WHEN THE PRODUCTS ARE DELIVERED, WHICH OCCURS WHEN THE

CUSTOMER HAS TAKEN TITLE AND HAS ASSUMED THE RISKS AND REWARDS OF OWNERSHIP, PRICES ARE FIXED OR DETERMINABLE AND COLLECTIBILITY IS REASONABLY ASSURED.

REVENUES FROM THE PRODUCTION OF NATURAL GAS PROPERTIES IN WHICH THE CORPORATION HAS AN INTEREST WITH OTHER PRODUCERS ARE RECOGNIZED ON THE BASIS OF THE CORPORATIONS NET WORKING INTEREST. DIFFERENCES BETWEEN

ACTUAL PRODUCTION AND NET WORKING INTEREST VOLUMES ARE NOT SIGNIFICANT.

AT ITS SEPTEMBER 2005 MEETING, THE EMERGING ISSUES TASK FORCE

(EITF) REACHED A CONSENSUS ON ISSUE NO. 04-13, ACCOUNTING FOR PURCHASES AND SALES OF INVENTORY WITH THE SAME COUNTERPARTY. THIS ISSUE ADDRESSES THE QUESTION OF WHEN IT IS APPROPRIATE TO MEASURE PURCHASES AND SALES OF INVENTORY AT

FAIR VALUE AND RECORD THEM IN COST OF SALES AND REVENUES AND WHEN THEY SHOULD BE RECORDED AS EXCHANGES MEASURED AT THE BOOK VALUE OF THE ITEM SOLD. THE EITF CONCLUDED THAT PURCHASES AND SALES OF INVENTORY WITH THE SAME COUNTERPARTY THAT ARE ENTERED

INTO IN CONTEMPLATION OF ONE ANOTHER SHOULD BE COMBINED AND RECORDED AS EXCHANGES MEASURED AT THE BOOK VALUE OF THE ITEM SOLD.

THE CORPORATION RECORDS IN REVENUES CERTAIN CRUDE OIL, NATURAL GAS, PETROLEUM PRODUCT AND CHEMICAL SALES WHERE THE CORPORATION CONTEMPORANEOUSLY NEGOTIATED PURCHASES WITH THE SAME

COUNTERPARTY. THE PURCHASES ARE RECORDED IN CRUDE OIL AND PRODUCT PURCHASES. THESE TRANSACTIONS ARE COMMONLY CALLED BUY/SELL TRANSACTIONS AND ARE USED TO ENSURE THAT THE RIGHT CRUDE OIL IS AVAILABLE TO THE CORPORATIONS REFINERIES

AT THE RIGHT TIME AND THAT APPROPRIATE PRODUCTS ARE AVAILABLE TO MEET CUSTOMER DEMAND. THE CORPORATIONS ACCOUNTING TREATMENT FOR THESE BUY/SELL TRANSACTIONS IS CONSISTENT WITH LONG STANDING INDUSTRY PRACTICE. THE EITF CONSENSUS WILL RESULT IN

THE CORPORATIONS ACCOUNTS SALES AND OTHER OPERATING REVENUE AND CRUDE OIL AND PRODUCT PURCHASES ON THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF INCOME BEING REDUCED BY ASSOCIATED AMOUNTS WITH NO IMPACT ON NET INCOME. ALL OPERATING

SEGMENTS WILL BE AFFECTED BY THIS CHANGE, BUT THE LARGEST IMPACTS ARE IN THE DOWNSTREAM. THE EITF CONSENSUS WILL BECOME EFFECTIVE, BEGINNING NO LATER THAN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2006.

THE PURCHASE/SALE AMOUNTS INCLUDED IN REVENUE FOR 2005, 2004 AND 2003 ARE SHOWN BELOW ALONG WITH TOTAL SALES AND OTHER OPERATING REVENUE TO

PROVIDE CONTEXT.

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS.

THE CORPORATION MAKES LIMITED USE OF DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS. THE CORPORATION DOES NOT

ENGAGE IN SPECULATIVE DERIVATIVE ACTIVITIES OR DERIVATIVE TRADING ACTIVITIES NOR DOES IT USE DERIVATIVES WITH LEVERAGED FEATURES. WHEN THE CORPORATION DOES ENTER INTO DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS, IT IS TO OFFSET EXPOSURES ASSOCIATED WITH INTEREST RATES,

FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES AND HYDROCARBON PRICES THAT ARISE FROM EXISTING ASSETS, LIABILITIES AND TRANSACTIONS.

THE GAINS AND LOSSES

RESULTING FROM CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF DERIVATIVES ARE RECORDED IN INCOME. IN SOME CASES, THE CORPORATION DESIGNATES DERIVATIVES AS FAIR VALUE HEDGES, IN WHICH CASE THE GAINS AND LOSSES ARE OFFSET IN INCOME BY THE GAINS AND LOSSES ARISING FROM

CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE UNDERLYING HEDGED ITEMS.

THE CORPORATION HAS CERTAIN LONG-TERM SALES AND PURCHASE CONTRACTS ENTERED INTO

IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS THAT ARE DEEMED TO BE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS. GAINS AND LOSSES ARISING FROM THESE CONTRACTS ARE CALCULATED BY THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE CONTRACT PRICES AND MARKET PRICES AND ARE RECOGNIZED IN INCOME.

INVENTORIES.

CRUDE OIL, PRODUCTS AND MERCHANDISE INVENTORIES ARE CARRIED AT THE LOWER OF CURRENT MARKET VALUE OR COST (GENERALLY DETERMINED UNDER THE LAST-IN,

FIRST-OUT METHOD  LIFO). INVENTORY COSTS INCLUDE EXPENDITURES AND OTHER CHARGES (INCLUDING DEPRECIATION) DIRECTLY AND INDIRECTLY INCURRED IN BRINGING THE INVENTORY TO ITS EXISTING CONDITION AND LOCATION. SELLING EXPENSES AND GENERAL AND

ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES ARE REPORTED AS PERIOD COSTS AND EXCLUDED FROM INVENTORY COST. INVENTORIES OF MATERIALS AND SUPPLIES ARE VALUED AT COST OR LESS.

PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT.

DEPRECIATION, DEPLETION AND AMORTIZATION, BASED ON COST LESS ESTIMATED SALVAGE VALUE OF THE ASSET, ARE PRIMARILY DETERMINED UNDER EITHER THE UNIT-OF-PRODUCTION METHOD OR THE STRAIGHT-LINE METHOD, WHICH

IS BASED ON ESTIMATED ASSET SERVICE LIFE TAKING OBSOLESCENCE INTO CONSIDERATION. MAINTENANCE AND REPAIRS, INCLUDING PLANNED MAJOR MAINTENANCE, ARE EXPENSED AS INCURRED. MAJOR RENEWALS AND IMPROVEMENTS ARE CAPITALIZED AND THE ASSETS REPLACED ARE

RETIRED.

THE CORPORATION USES THE SUCCESSFUL EFFORTS METHOD TO ACCOUNT FOR ITS EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION ACTIVITIES. UNDER

THIS METHOD, COSTS ARE ACCUMULATED ON A FIELD-BY-FIELD BASIS WITH CERTAIN EXPLORATORY EXPENDITURES AND EXPLORATORY DRY HOLES BEING EXPENSED AS INCURRED. COSTS OF PRODUCTIVE WELLS AND DEVELOPMENT DRY HOLES ARE CAPITALIZED AND AMORTIZED ON THE

UNIT-OF-PRODUCTION METHOD FOR EACH FIELD.

THE CORPORATION CARRIES AS AN ASSET EXPLORATORY WELL COSTS WHEN THE WELL HAS FOUND A SUFFICIENT

QUANTITY OF RESERVES TO JUSTIFY ITS COMPLETION AS A PRODUCING WELL AND WHERE THE CORPORATION IS MAKING SUFFICIENT PROGRESS ASSESSING THE RESERVES AND THE ECONOMIC AND OPERATING VIABILITY OF THE PROJECT. EXPLORATORY WELL COSTS NOT MEETING THESE

CRITERIA ARE CHARGED TO EXPENSE.

ACQUISITION COSTS OF PROVED PROPERTIES ARE AMORTIZED USING A UNIT-OF-PRODUCTION METHOD, COMPUTED ON THE

BASIS OF TOTAL PROVED OIL AND GAS RESERVES. SIGNIFICANT UNPROVED PROPERTIES ARE ASSESSED FOR IMPAIRMENT INDIVIDUALLY AND VALUATION ALLOWANCES AGAINST THE CAPITALIZED COSTS ARE RECORDED BASED ON THE ESTIMATED ECONOMIC CHANCE OF SUCCESS AND THE LENGTH

OF TIME THAT THE CORPORATION EXPECTS TO HOLD THE PROPERTIES. THE COST OF PROPERTIES THAT ARE NOT INDIVIDUALLY SIGNIFICANT ARE AGGREGATED BY GROUPS AND AMORTIZED OVER THE AVERAGE HOLDING PERIOD OF THE PROPERTIES OF THE GROUPS. THE VALUATION

ALLOWANCES ARE REVIEWED AT LEAST ANNUALLY. OTHER EXPLORATORY EXPENDITURES, INCLUDING GEOPHYSICAL COSTS, OTHER DRY HOLE COSTS AND ANNUAL LEASE RENTALS, ARE EXPENSED AS INCURRED.

UNIT-OF-PRODUCTION DEPRECIATION IS APPLIED TO PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT, INCLUDING CAPITALIZED EXPLORATORY DRILLING AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS, ASSOCIATED

WITH PRODUCTIVE DEPLETABLE EXTRACTIVE PROPERTIES, ALL IN THE UPSTREAM SEGMENT. UNIT-OF-PRODUCTION RATES ARE BASED ON THE AMOUNT OF PROVED DEVELOPED RESERVES OF OIL, GAS AND OTHER MINERALS THAT ARE ESTIMATED TO BE RECOVERABLE FROM EXISTING FACILITIES

USING CURRENT OPERATING METHODS. ADDITIONAL OIL AND GAS TO BE OBTAINED THROUGH THE APPLICATION OF IMPROVED RECOVERY TECHNIQUES IS INCLUDED WHEN, OR TO THE EXTENT THAT, THE REQUISITE COMMERCIAL-SCALE FACILITIES HAVE BEEN INSTALLED AND THE REQUIRED

WELLS HAVE BEEN DRILLED.

UNDER THE UNIT-OF-PRODUCTION METHOD, OIL AND GAS VOLUMES ARE CONSIDERED PRODUCED ONCE THEY HAVE BEEN MEASURED

THROUGH METERS AT CUSTODY TRANSFER OR SALES TRANSACTION POINTS AT THE OUTLET VALVE ON THE LEASE OR FIELD STORAGE TANK.

53

TABLE OF CONTENTS

INDEX TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

PRODUCTION COSTS ARE EXPENSED AS INCURRED. PRODUCTION INVOLVES LIFTING THE OIL AND GAS TO THE SURFACE AND GATHERING, TREATING, FIELD PROCESSING AND FIELD

STORAGE OF THE OIL AND GAS. THE PRODUCTION FUNCTION NORMALLY TERMINATES AT THE OUTLET VALVE ON THE LEASE OR FIELD PRODUCTION STORAGE TANK. PRODUCTION COSTS ARE THOSE INCURRED TO OPERATE AND MAINTAIN THE CORPORATIONS WELLS AND RELATED EQUIPMENT

AND FACILITIES. THEY BECOME PART OF THE COST OF OIL AND GAS PRODUCED. THESE COSTS, SOMETIMES REFERRED TO AS LIFTING COSTS, INCLUDE SUCH ITEMS AS LABOR COSTS TO OPERATE THE WELLS AND RELATED EQUIPMENT; REPAIR AND MAINTENANCE COSTS ON THE WELLS AND

EQUIPMENT; MATERIALS, SUPPLIES AND ENERGY COSTS REQUIRED TO OPERATE THE WELLS AND RELATED EQUIPMENT; AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES RELATED TO THE PRODUCTION ACTIVITY.

GAINS ON SALES OF PROVED AND UNPROVED PROPERTIES ARE ONLY RECOGNIZED WHEN THERE IS NO UNCERTAINTY ABOUT THE RECOVERY OF COSTS APPLICABLE TO ANY INTEREST RETAINED OR WHERE THERE IS NO SUBSTANTIAL OBLIGATION FOR FUTURE

PERFORMANCE BY THE CORPORATION. LOSSES ON PROPERTIES SOLD ARE RECOGNIZED WHEN INCURRED OR WHEN THE PROPERTIES ARE HELD FOR SALE AND THE FAIR VALUE OF THE PROPERTIES IS LESS THAN THE CARRYING VALUE.

PROVED OIL AND GAS PROPERTIES HELD AND USED BY THE CORPORATION ARE REVIEWED FOR IMPAIRMENT WHENEVER EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THAT THE

CARRYING AMOUNTS MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE. ASSETS ARE GROUPED AT THE LOWEST LEVEL FOR WHICH THERE ARE IDENTIFIABLE CASH FLOWS THAT ARE LARGELY INDEPENDENT OF THE CASH FLOWS OF OTHER GROUPS OF ASSETS.

THE CORPORATION ESTIMATES THE FUTURE UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS OF THE AFFECTED PROPERTIES TO JUDGE THE RECOVERABILITY OF CARRYING AMOUNTS. CASH FLOWS USED

IN IMPAIRMENT EVALUATIONS ARE DEVELOPED USING ANNUALLY UPDATED CORPORATE PLAN INVESTMENT EVALUATION ASSUMPTIONS FOR CRUDE OIL COMMODITY PRICES AND FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES. ANNUAL VOLUMES ARE BASED ON INDIVIDUAL FIELD PRODUCTION PROFILES,

WHICH ARE ALSO UPDATED ANNUALLY. PRICES FOR NATURAL GAS AND OTHER PRODUCTS ARE BASED ON CORPORATE PLAN ASSUMPTIONS DEVELOPED ANNUALLY BY MAJOR REGION AND ALSO FOR INVESTMENT EVALUATION PURPOSES. CASH FLOW ESTIMATES FOR IMPAIRMENT TESTING EXCLUDE

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS.

IMPAIRMENT ANALYSES ARE GENERALLY BASED ON PROVED RESERVES. WHERE PROBABLE RESERVES EXIST, AN APPROPRIATELY

RISK-ADJUSTED AMOUNT OF THESE RESERVES MAY BE INCLUDED IN THE IMPAIRMENT EVALUATION. IMPAIRMENTS ARE MEASURED BY THE AMOUNT THE CARRYING VALUE EXCEEDS THE FAIR VALUE.

ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS AND ENVIRONMENTAL COSTS.

THE CORPORATION INCURS RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS FOR ITS UPSTREAM ASSETS. THE FAIR VALUES OF THESE OBLIGATIONS ARE RECORDED AS LIABILITIES ON A DISCOUNTED

BASIS, WHICH IS TYPICALLY AT THE TIME THE ASSETS ARE INSTALLED. THE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THESE LIABILITIES ARE CAPITALIZED AS PART OF THE RELATED ASSETS AND DEPRECIATED AS THE RESERVES ARE PRODUCED. OVER TIME, THE LIABILITIES ARE ACCRETED FOR THE

CHANGE IN PRESENT VALUE. ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS ARE NOT RECORDED FOR DOWNSTREAM AND CHEMICAL FACILITIES, BECAUSE SUCH POTENTIAL OBLIGATIONS CANNOT BE MEASURED SINCE IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO ESTIMATE THE SETTLEMENT DATES.

LIABILITIES FOR ENVIRONMENTAL COSTS ARE RECORDED WHEN IT IS PROBABLE THAT OBLIGATIONS HAVE BEEN INCURRED AND THE AMOUNTS CAN BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED.

THESE LIABILITIES ARE NOT REDUCED BY POSSIBLE RECOVERIES FROM THIRD PARTIES, AND PROJECTED CASH EXPENDITURES ARE NOT DISCOUNTED.

FOREIGN CURRENCY

TRANSLATION.

THE FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY FOR TRANSLATING THE ACCOUNTS OF THE MAJORITY OF DOWNSTREAM AND CHEMICAL OPERATIONS OUTSIDE THE U.S. IS THE LOCAL CURRENCY. LOCAL CURRENCY IS ALSO USED FOR UPSTREAM OPERATIONS THAT ARE RELATIVELY

SELF-CONTAINED AND INTEGRATED WITHIN A PARTICULAR COUNTRY, SUCH AS IN CANADA, THE UNITED KINGDOM, NORWAY AND CONTINENTAL EUROPE. THE U.S. DOLLAR IS USED FOR OPERATIONS IN HIGHLY INFLATIONARY ECONOMIES, IN SINGAPORE, WHICH IS PREDOMINANTLY

EXPORT-ORIENTED, AND FOR SOME UPSTREAM OPERATIONS, PRIMARILY IN MALAYSIA, INDONESIA, ANGOLA, NIGERIA, EQUATORIAL GUINEA, RUSSIA AND THE MIDDLE EAST. FOR ALL OPERATIONS, GAINS OR LOSSES ON REMEASURING FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSACTIONS INTO FUNCTIONAL

CURRENCY ARE INCLUDED IN INCOME.

SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS.

EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2003, THE CORPORATION ADOPTED FOR ALL EMPLOYEE SHARE-BASED

AWARDS GRANTED AFTER THAT DATE, THE RECOGNITION PROVISIONS OF STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS NO. 123 (FAS 123), ACCOUNTING FOR SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION. IN ACCORDANCE WITH FAS 123, COMPENSATION EXPENSE FOR AWARDS

GRANTED ON OR AFTER JANUARY 1, 2003, HAVE BEEN MEASURED BY THE FAIR VALUE OF THE AWARD AT THE DATE OF GRANT AND RECOGNIZED OVER THE REQUISITE SERVICE PERIOD. THE FAIR VALUE OF AWARDS IN THE FORM OF RESTRICTED STOCK IS THE MARKET PRICE OF THE

STOCK. THE FAIR VALUE OF AWARDS IN THE FORM OF STOCK OPTIONS IS ESTIMATED USING AN OPTION-PRICING MODEL.

THE CORPORATION HAS RETAINED ITS PRIOR METHOD OF ACCOUNTING FOR SHARE-BASED AWARDS GRANTED BEFORE JANUARY 1, 2003. UNDER THIS METHOD, COMPENSATION EXPENSE FOR AWARDS GRANTED IN THE FORM

OF STOCK OPTIONS IS MEASURED AT THE INTRINSIC VALUE OF THE OPTIONS (THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE MARKET PRICE OF STOCK AND THE EXERCISE PRICE OF THE OPTIONS) ON THE DATE OF GRANT. SINCE THESE TWO PRICES ARE THE SAME ON THE DATE OF GRANT, NO

COMPENSATION EXPENSE HAS BEEN RECOGNIZED IN INCOME FOR THESE AWARDS. IN 2002, THE CORPORATION BEGAN ISSUING RESTRICTED STOCK AS SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION IN LIEU OF STOCK OPTIONS. COMPENSATION EXPENSE FOR THESE AWARDS IS BASED ON THE PRICE OF STOCK

WHEN IT IS GRANTED AND IS RECOGNIZED IN INCOME OVER THE REQUISITE SERVICE PERIOD, WHICH IS THE SAME METHOD OF ACCOUNTING AS UNDER FAS 123. THE NET INCOME PER SHARE FOR 2003 THROUGH 2005 WOULD BE UNCHANGED IF THE PROVISIONS OF FAS 123 HAD BEEN

ADOPTED FOR ALL PRIOR YEARS.

IN DECEMBER 2004, THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD (FASB) ISSUED A REVISED STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL

ACCOUNTING STANDARDS NO. 123 (FAS 123R), SHARE-BASED PAYMENT, WHICH WILL BECOME EFFECTIVE FOR THE CORPORATION AS OF JANUARY 1, 2006. ADOPTION OF FAS 123R WILL NOT MATERIALLY CHANGE THE CORPORATIONS EXISTING ACCOUNTING

PRACTICES OR THE AMOUNT OF SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS.

2. ACCOUNTING FOR SUSPENDED EXPLORATORY WELL COSTS

EFFECTIVE JULY 1, 2005, THE CORPORATION ADOPTED FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING

STANDARDS BOARD STAFF POSITION FAS 19-1 (FSP 19-1), ACCOUNTING FOR SUSPENDED WELL COSTS. FSP 19-1 AMENDED STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS NO. 19 (FAS 19), FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING AND REPORTING BY OIL AND GAS PRODUCING

COMPANIES, TO PERMIT THE CONTINUED CAPITALIZATION OF EXPLORATORY WELL COSTS BEYOND ONE YEAR IF (A) THE WELL FOUND A SUFFICIENT QUANTITY OF RESERVES TO JUSTIFY ITS COMPLETION AS A PRODUCING WELL AND (B) THE ENTITY IS MAKING SUFFICIENT

PROGRESS ASSESSING THE RESERVES AND THE ECONOMIC AND OPERATING VIABILITY OF THE PROJECT. THERE WERE NO CAPITALIZED EXPLORATORY WELL COSTS CHARGED TO EXPENSE UPON THE ADOPTION OF FSP 19-1.

PRIOR TO THE ADOPTION OF FSP 19-1, THE CORPORATION CARRIED AS AN ASSET THE COST OF DRILLING EXPLORATORY WELLS THAT FOUND SUFFICIENT QUANTITIES OF

RESERVES TO JUSTIFY THEIR COMPLETION AS PRODUCING WELLS IF THE REQUIRED CAPITAL EXPENDITURE WAS MADE AND DRILLING OF ADDITIONAL EXPLORATORY WELLS WAS UNDER WAY OR FIRMLY PLANNED FOR THE NEAR FUTURE. ONCE EXPLORATION ACTIVITIES DEMONSTRATED THAT

SUFFICIENT QUANTITIES OF COMMERCIALLY PRODUCIBLE RESERVES HAD BEEN DISCOVERED, CONTINUED CAPITALIZATION WAS DEPENDENT ON PROJECT REVIEWS, WHICH TOOK PLACE AT LEAST ANNUALLY, TO ENSURE THAT SATISFACTORY PROGRESS TOWARD ULTIMATE DEVELOPMENT OF THE

RESERVES WAS BEING ACHIEVED. EXPLORATORY WELL COSTS NOT MEETING THESE CRITERIA WERE CHARGED TO EXPENSE.

THE FOLLOWING TWO TABLES PROVIDE

DETAILS OF THE CHANGES IN THE BALANCE OF SUSPENDED EXPLORATORY WELL COSTS AS WELL AS AN AGING SUMMARY OF THOSE COSTS.

IN THE UPSTREAM SEGMENT, DEPRECIATION IS ON A UNIT-OF-PRODUCTION BASIS, SO DEPRECIABLE LIFE WILL VARY BY FIELD. IN

THE DOWNSTREAM SEGMENT, INVESTMENTS IN REFINERY AND LUBES BASESTOCK MANUFACTURING FACILITIES ARE GENERALLY DEPRECIATED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER A 25-YEAR LIFE AND SERVICE STATION BUILDINGS AND FIXED IMPROVEMENTS OVER A 20-YEAR LIFE. IN THE

CHEMICAL SEGMENT, INVESTMENTS IN PROCESS EQUIPMENT ARE GENERALLY DEPRECIATED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER A 20-YEAR LIFE.

ACCUMULATED

DEPRECIATION AND DEPLETION TOTALED $133,284 MILLION AT THE END OF 2005 AND $133,783 MILLION AT THE END OF 2004. INTEREST CAPITALIZED IN 2005, 2004 AND 2003 WAS $434 MILLION, $500 MILLION AND $490 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY.

ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS (AROS)

AS OF JANUARY 1, 2003, THE

CORPORATION ADOPTED FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS NO. 143 (FAS 143), ACCOUNTING FOR ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS. UNDER FAS 143, THE FAIR VALUES OF ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS ARE

RECORDED AS LIABILITIES ON A DISCOUNTED BASIS WHEN THEY ARE INCURRED, WHICH IS TYPICALLY AT THE TIME THE ASSETS ARE INSTALLED. AMOUNTS RECORDED FOR THE RELATED ASSETS WILL BE INCREASED BY THE AMOUNT OF THESE OBLIGATIONS. OVER TIME, THE LIABILITIES

WILL BE ACCRETED FOR THE CHANGE IN THEIR PRESENT VALUE AND THE INITIAL CAPITALIZED COSTS WILL BE DEPRECIATED OVER THE USEFUL LIVES OF THE RELATED ASSETS. ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS ARE NOT RECORDED FOR DOWNSTREAM AND CHEMICAL FACILITIES BECAUSE

SUCH POTENTIAL OBLIGATIONS CANNOT BE MEASURED SINCE IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO ESTIMATE THE SETTLEMENT DATES.

THE CUMULATIVE ADJUSTMENT FOR THE

CHANGE IN ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLE REPORTED IN 2003 WAS AFTER-TAX INCOME OF $550 MILLION.

11. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND DERIVATIVES

THE FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS IS DETERMINED BY REFERENCE TO VARIOUS

MARKET DATA AND OTHER VALUATION TECHNIQUES AS APPROPRIATE. LONG-TERM DEBT IS THE ONLY CATEGORY OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WHOSE FAIR VALUE DIFFERS MATERIALLY FROM THE RECORDED BOOK VALUE. THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF TOTAL LONG-TERM DEBT, INCLUDING

CAPITALIZED LEASE OBLIGATIONS, AT DECEMBER 31, 2005, AND 2004, WAS $7.0 BILLION AND $5.9 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY, AS COMPARED TO RECORDED BOOK VALUES OF $6.2 BILLION AND $5.0 BILLION.

THE CORPORATIONS SIZE, STRONG CAPITAL STRUCTURE, GEOGRAPHIC DIVERSITY AND THE COMPLEMENTARY NATURE OF THE UPSTREAM, DOWNSTREAM AND CHEMICAL

BUSINESSES REDUCE THE CORPORATIONS ENTERPRISE WIDE RISK FROM CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES, CURRENCY RATES AND COMMODITY PRICES. AS A RESULT, THE CORPORATION MAKES LIMITED USE OF DERIVATIVES TO MITIGATE THE IMPACT OF SUCH CHANGES. THE CORPORATION

DOES NOT ENGAGE IN SPECULATIVE DERIVATIVE ACTIVITIES OR DERIVATIVE TRADING ACTIVITIES NOR DOES IT USE DERIVATIVES WITH LEVERAGED FEATURES. THE CORPORATION MAINTAINS A SYSTEM OF CONTROLS THAT INCLUDES THE AUTHORIZATION, REPORTING AND MONITORING OF

DERIVATIVE ACTIVITY. THE CORPORATIONS LIMITED DERIVATIVE ACTIVITIES POSE NO MATERIAL CREDIT OR MARKET RISKS TO EXXONMOBILS OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL CONDITION OR LIQUIDITY.

THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUES OF DERIVATIVES OUTSTANDING AND RECORDED ON THE BALANCE SHEET ARE SHOWN IN THE TABLE BELOW. THIS IS THE AMOUNT THAT THE

CORPORATION WOULD HAVE PAID TO, OR RECEIVED FROM, THIRD PARTIES IF THESE DERIVATIVES HAD BEEN SETTLED IN THE OPEN MARKET. THE MAJORITY OF THE 2005 AMOUNT RESULTED FROM LONG-TERM U.K. GAS SALES AND PURCHASE CONTRACTS ENTERED INTO IN THE NORMAL COURSE

OF BUSINESS THAT ARE DEEMED TO BE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS. THE AMOUNTS REFLECT THE INCREASE IN U.K. MARKET GAS PRICES RELATIVE TO THE PRICES INCLUDED IN THE CONTRACTS. THESE CONTRACTS ARE EXPECTED TO BE SETTLED IN FULL BY PHYSICAL DELIVERY OF THE

UNDERLYING COMMODITY.

12. LONG-TERM DEBT

AT DECEMBER 31, 2005, LONG-TERM DEBT CONSISTED OF $6,014 MILLION DUE IN U.S. DOLLARS AND $206 MILLION

REPRESENTING THE U.S. DOLLAR EQUIVALENT AT YEAR-END EXCHANGE RATES OF AMOUNTS PAYABLE IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES. THESE AMOUNTS EXCLUDE THAT PORTION OF LONG-TERM DEBT, TOTALING $515 MILLION, WHICH MATURES WITHIN ONE YEAR AND IS INCLUDED IN CURRENT

LIABILITIES. THE AMOUNTS OF LONG-TERM DEBT MATURING, TOGETHER WITH SINKING FUND PAYMENTS REQUIRED, IN EACH OF THE FOUR YEARS AFTER DECEMBER 31, 2006, IN MILLIONS OF DOLLARS, ARE: 2007  $99, 2008  $284, 2009  $111 AND 2010

THE 2003 INCENTIVE PROGRAM PROVIDES FOR GRANTS OF STOCK OPTIONS, STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS (SARS),

RESTRICTED STOCK AND OTHER FORMS OF AWARD. AWARDS MAY BE GRANTED TO ELIGIBLE EMPLOYEES OF THE CORPORATION AND THOSE AFFILIATES AT LEAST 50 PERCENT OWNED. THE MAXIMUM NUMBER OF SHARES OF STOCK THAT MAY BE ISSUED UNDER THE 2003 INCENTIVE PROGRAM IS

220 MILLION. AWARDS THAT ARE FORFEITED OR EXPIRE, OR ARE SETTLED IN CASH, DO NOT COUNT AGAINST THIS MAXIMUM LIMIT. THE 2003 INCENTIVE PROGRAM DOES NOT HAVE A SPECIFIED TERM. NEW AWARDS MAY BE MADE UNTIL THE AVAILABLE SHARES ARE DEPLETED, UNLESS THE

BOARD TERMINATES THE PLAN EARLY. OUTSTANDING AWARDS ARE SUBJECT TO CERTAIN FORFEITURE PROVISIONS CONTAINED IN THE PROGRAM OR AWARD INSTRUMENT. SHARES AVAILABLE FOR GRANTING UNDER THE 2003 INCENTIVE PROGRAM WERE 188,928 THOUSAND AT THE END OF

2005.

AS UNDER EARLIER PROGRAMS, OPTIONS AND SARS MAY BE GRANTED AT PRICES NOT LESS THAN 100 PERCENT OF

MARKET VALUE ON THE DATE OF GRANT AND HAVE A MAXIMUM LIFE OF 10 YEARS. MOST OF THE OPTIONS AND SARS NORMALLY FIRST BECOME EXERCISABLE ONE YEAR FOLLOWING THE DATE OF GRANT. ALL REMAINING STOCK OPTIONS AND SARS OUTSTANDING WERE GRANTED PRIOR TO 2002.

LONG-TERM INCENTIVE AWARDS

TOTALING 11,071 THOUSAND, 11,374 THOUSAND AND 10,381 THOUSAND SHARES OF RESTRICTED (NONVESTED) COMMON STOCK AND RESTRICTED (NONVESTED) COMMON STOCK UNITS WERE GRANTED IN 2005, 2004 AND 2003, RESPECTIVELY. THESE SHARES ARE ISSUED TO

EMPLOYEES FROM TREASURY STOCK. THE TOTAL COMPENSATION EXPENSE IS RECOGNIZED OVER THE REQUISITE SERVICE PERIOD. THE UNITS THAT ARE SETTLED IN CASH ARE RECORDED AS LIABILITIES AND THEIR CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE ARE RECOGNIZED OVER THE VESTING PERIOD.

DURING THE APPLICABLE RESTRICTED PERIODS, THE SHARES MAY NOT BE SOLD OR TRANSFERRED AND ARE SUBJECT TO FORFEITURE. THE MAJORITY OF THE AWARDS HAVE GRADED VESTING PERIODS, WITH 50 PERCENT OF THE SHARES IN EACH AWARD VESTING AFTER THREE YEARS AND THE

REMAINING 50 PERCENT VESTING AFTER SEVEN YEARS. A SMALL NUMBER OF AWARDS GRANTED TO CERTAIN EMPLOYEES HAVE LONGER VESTING PERIODS. THE TABLE ON THE FOLLOWING PAGE PROVIDES ADDITIONAL DETAILS ON RESTRICTED STOCK AWARDS IN 2003, 2004, AND 2005.

14. LITIGATION AND OTHER CONTINGENCIES

LITIGATION

A VARIETY OF CLAIMS HAVE BEEN MADE AGAINST EXXONMOBIL AND CERTAIN OF ITS CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES IN A NUMBER OF PENDING LAWSUITS AND TAX DISPUTES. THE CORPORATION ACCRUES AN UNDISCOUNTED LIABILITY FOR THOSE

CONTINGENCIES WHERE THE INCURRENCE OF A LOSS IS PROBABLE AND THE AMOUNT CAN BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED. THE CORPORATION DOES NOT RECORD LIABILITIES WHEN THE LIKELIHOOD THAT THE LIABILITY HAS BEEN INCURRED IS PROBABLE BUT THE AMOUNT CANNOT BE REASONABLY

ESTIMATED, OR WHEN THE LIABILITY IS BELIEVED TO BE ONLY REASONABLY POSSIBLE OR REMOTE. EXXONMOBIL WILL CONTINUE TO DEFEND ITSELF VIGOROUSLY IN THESE MATTERS. BASED ON A CONSIDERATION OF ALL RELEVANT FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES, THE CORPORATION DOES NOT

BELIEVE THE ULTIMATE OUTCOME OF ANY CURRENTLY PENDING LAWSUIT AGAINST EXXONMOBIL WILL HAVE A MATERIALLY ADVERSE EFFECT UPON THE CORPORATIONS OPERATIONS OR FINANCIAL CONDITION.

A NUMBER OF LAWSUITS, INCLUDING CLASS ACTIONS,

WERE BROUGHT IN VARIOUS COURTS AGAINST EXXON MOBIL CORPORATION AND CERTAIN OF ITS SUBSIDIARIES RELATING TO THE ACCIDENTAL RELEASE OF CRUDE OIL FROM THE TANKER EXXON VALDEZ IN 1989. THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE COMPENSATORY CLAIMS HAVE BEEN RESOLVED AND

PAID. ALL OF THE PUNITIVE DAMAGE CLAIMS WERE CONSOLIDATED IN THE CIVIL TRIAL THAT BEGAN IN 1994. THE FIRST JUDGMENT FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF ALASKA IN THE AMOUNT OF $5 BILLION WAS VACATED BY THE UNITED STATES COURT

OF APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT AS BEING EXCESSIVE UNDER THE CONSTITUTION. THE SECOND JUDGMENT IN THE AMOUNT OF $4 BILLION WAS VACATED BY THE NINTH CIRCUIT PANEL WITHOUT ARGUMENT AND SENT BACK FOR THE DISTRICT COURT TO RECONSIDER IN LIGHT OF THE

RECENT U.S. SUPREME COURT DECISION IN

CAMPBELL V. STATE FARM

. THE MOST RECENT DISTRICT COURT JUDGMENT FOR PUNITIVE DAMAGES WAS FOR $4.5 BILLION PLUS INTEREST AND WAS ENTERED IN JANUARY 2004. EXXONMOBIL AND THE PLAINTIFFS HAVE APPEALED THIS

DECISION TO THE NINTH CIRCUIT. THE CORPORATION HAS POSTED A $5.4 BILLION LETTER OF CREDIT. ORAL ARGUMENTS WERE HELD BEFORE THE NINTH CIRCUIT ON JANUARY 27, 2006. MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT THE LIKELIHOOD OF THE JUDGMENT BEING UPHELD IS REMOTE.

WHILE IT IS REASONABLY POSSIBLE THAT A LIABILITY MAY HAVE BEEN INCURRED FROM THE EXXON VALDEZ GROUNDING,

68

TABLE OF CONTENTS

INDEX TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO PREDICT THE ULTIMATE OUTCOME OR TO REASONABLY ESTIMATE ANY SUCH POTENTIAL LIABILITY.

IN DECEMBER 2000, A JURY IN THE 15TH JUDICIAL CIRCUIT COURT OF MONTGOMERY COUNTY, ALABAMA, RETURNED A VERDICT AGAINST THE CORPORATION IN A DISPUTE OVER

ROYALTIES IN THE AMOUNT OF $88 MILLION IN COMPENSATORY DAMAGES AND $3.4 BILLION IN PUNITIVE DAMAGES IN THE CASE OF

EXXON CORPORATION V. STATE OF ALABAMA, ET AL

. THE VERDICT WAS UPHELD BY THE TRIAL COURT IN MAY 2001. IN DECEMBER 2002, THE

ALABAMA SUPREME COURT VACATED THE $3.5 BILLION JURY VERDICT. THE CASE WAS RETRIED AND IN NOVEMBER 2003, A STATE DISTRICT COURT JURY IN MONTGOMERY, ALABAMA, RETURNED A VERDICT AGAINST EXXON MOBIL CORPORATION. THE VERDICT INCLUDED $63.5 MILLION IN

COMPENSATORY DAMAGES AND $11.8 BILLION IN PUNITIVE DAMAGES. IN MARCH 2004, THE DISTRICT COURT JUDGE REDUCED THE AMOUNT OF PUNITIVE DAMAGES TO $3.5 BILLION. EXXONMOBIL BELIEVES THE JUDGMENT IS NOT JUSTIFIED BY THE EVIDENCE, THAT ANY PUNITIVE DAMAGE

AWARD IS NOT JUSTIFIED BY EITHER THE FACTS OR THE LAW, AND THAT THE AMOUNT OF THE AWARD IS GROSSLY EXCESSIVE AND UNCONSTITUTIONAL. EXXONMOBIL HAS APPEALED THE DECISION TO THE ALABAMA SUPREME COURT. MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT THE LIKELIHOOD OF THE

JUDGMENT BEING UPHELD IS REMOTE. WHILE IT IS REASONABLY POSSIBLE THAT A LIABILITY MAY HAVE BEEN INCURRED BY EXXONMOBIL FROM THIS DISPUTE OVER ROYALTIES, IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO PREDICT THE ULTIMATE OUTCOME OR TO REASONABLY ESTIMATE ANY SUCH POTENTIAL

LIABILITY. IN MAY 2004, THE CORPORATION POSTED A $4.5 BILLION SUPERSEDEAS BOND AS REQUIRED BY ALABAMA LAW TO STAY EXECUTION OF THE JUDGMENT PENDING APPEAL. THE CORPORATION HAS PLEDGED TO THE ISSUER OF THE BOND COLLATERAL CONSISTING OF CASH AND

SHORT-TERM, HIGH-QUALITY SECURITIES WITH AN AGGREGATE VALUE OF APPROXIMATELY $4.6 BILLION. THIS COLLATERAL IS REPORTED AS RESTRICTED CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET. UNDER THE TERMS OF THE PLEDGE AGREEMENT, THE

CORPORATION IS ENTITLED TO RECEIVE THE INCOME GENERATED FROM THE CASH AND SECURITIES AND TO MAKE INVESTMENT DECISIONS, BUT IS RESTRICTED FROM USING THE PLEDGED CASH AND SECURITIES FOR ANY OTHER PURPOSE UNTIL SUCH TIME THE BOND IS CANCELED.

IN 2001, A LOUISIANA STATE COURT JURY AWARDED COMPENSATORY DAMAGES OF $56 MILLION AND PUNITIVE DAMAGES OF $1 BILLION TO A LANDOWNER FOR

DAMAGE CAUSED BY A THIRD PARTY THAT LEASED THE PROPERTY FROM THE LANDOWNER. THE THIRD PARTY PROVIDED PIPE CLEANING AND STORAGE SERVICES FOR THE CORPORATION AND OTHER ENTITIES. THE LOUISIANA FOURTH CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS REDUCED THE PUNITIVE DAMAGE

AWARD TO $112 MILLION IN 2005. THE CORPORATION APPEALED THIS DECISION TO THE LOUISIANA SUPREME COURT AS IT CONTINUES TO BELIEVE THAT THESE JUDGMENTS SHOULD BE SUBSTANTIALLY REDUCED ON LEGAL AND CONSTITUTIONAL GROUNDS. WHILE IT IS REASONABLY POSSIBLE

THAT A LIABILITY MAY HAVE BEEN INCURRED, IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO PREDICT THE ULTIMATE OUTCOME OR TO REASONABLY ESTIMATE ANY SUCH POTENTIAL LIABILITY.

IN

ALLAPATTAH V. EXXON

, A JURY IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF FLORIDA DETERMINED IN 2001 THAT A CLASS OF EXXON DEALERS BETWEEN MARCH 1983 AND AUGUST 1994 HAD BEEN OVERCHARGED FOR GASOLINE. IN JUNE

2003, THE ELEVENTH CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS AFFIRMED THE JUDGMENT AND IN MARCH 2004, DENIED A PETITION FOR REHEARING EN BANC. IN OCTOBER 2004, THE U.S. SUPREME COURT GRANTED REVIEW AS TO WHETHER THE CLASS IN THE DISTRICT COURT JUDGMENT SHOULD

INCLUDE MEMBERS THAT INDIVIDUALLY DO NOT SATISFY THE $50,000 MINIMUM AMOUNT-IN-CONTROVERSY REQUIREMENT IN FEDERAL COURT. IN LIGHT OF THE SUPREME COURTS DECISION TO GRANT REVIEW OF ONLY PART OF EXXONMOBILS APPEAL, THE CORPORATION TOOK AN

AFTER-TAX CHARGE OF $550 MILLION IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2004 REFLECTING THE ESTIMATED LIABILITY, AFTER CONSIDERING POTENTIAL SET-OFFS AND DEFENSES FOR THE CLAIMS UNDER REVIEW BY THE SUPREME COURT. IN JUNE 2005, THE SUPREME COURT GRANTED THE

DISTRICT COURT THE RIGHT TO HEAR THE CLAIMS OF ALL CLASS MEMBERS AND THE CORPORATION TOOK AN AFTER-TAX CHARGE OF $200 MILLION. CLASS COUNSEL AND EXXONMOBIL ARE SEEKING COURT APPROVAL OF A SETTLEMENT OF $1,075 MILLION, PRE-TAX THAT WOULD ESSENTIALLY

FINALIZE THE CORPORATIONS FINANCIAL OBLIGATION IN THE CASE; THIS OBLIGATION HAS BEEN FULLY ACCRUED. THE TRIAL COURT HAS PRELIMINARILY APPROVED THE SETTLEMENT. NOTICE HAS BEEN ISSUED TO THE CLASS AND THE FINAL APPROVAL HEARING WILL OCCUR IN

APRIL 2006.

TAX ISSUES FOR 1986 TO 1993 REMAIN PENDING BEFORE THE U.S. TAX COURT. THE ULTIMATE RESOLUTION OF THESE ISSUES IS NOT EXPECTED

TO HAVE A MATERIALLY ADVERSE EFFECT UPON THE CORPORATIONS OPERATIONS OR FINANCIAL CONDITION.

OTHER CONTINGENCIES

THE CORPORATION AND CERTAIN OF ITS CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES WERE CONTINGENTLY LIABLE AT DECEMBER 31, 2005, FOR $3,893 MILLION, PRIMARILY RELATING TO GUARANTEES FOR

NOTES, LOANS AND PERFORMANCE UNDER CONTRACTS. THIS INCLUDED $1,020 MILLION REPRESENTING GUARANTEES OF NON-U.S. EXCISE TAXES AND CUSTOMS DUTIES OF OTHER COMPANIES, ENTERED INTO AS A NORMAL BUSINESS PRACTICE, UNDER RECIPROCAL ARRANGEMENTS. ALSO

INCLUDED IN THIS AMOUNT WERE GUARANTEES BY CONSOLIDATED AFFILIATES OF $2,649 MILLION, REPRESENTING EXXONMOBILS SHARE OF OBLIGATIONS OF CERTAIN EQUITY COMPANIES.

THE TERM BENEFIT OBLIGATION MEANS PROJECTED BENEFIT OBLIGATION AS DEFINED BY STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING

STANDARDS NO. 87 (FAS 87), EMPLOYERS ACCOUNTING FOR PENSIONS, FOR ANNUITY BENEFITS AND ACCUMULATED POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATION AS DEFINED BY FAS 106, EMPLOYERS ACCOUNTING FOR POSTRETIREMENT

BENEFITS OTHER THAN PENSIONS, FOR OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS.

FOR U.S. PLANS, THE DISCOUNT RATE IS DETERMINED BY

CONSTRUCTING A PORTFOLIO OF HIGH-QUALITY, NON-CALLABLE BONDS WITH CASH FLOWS THAT MATCH ESTIMATED OUTFLOWS FOR BENEFIT PAYMENTS. FOR MAJOR NON-U.S. PLANS, THE DISCOUNT RATE IS DETERMINED BY USING BOND PORTFOLIOS WITH AN AVERAGE MATURITY

APPROXIMATING THAT OF THE LIABILITIES OR SPOT YIELD CURVES, BOTH OF WHICH ARE CONSTRUCTED USING HIGH-QUALITY, LOCAL-CURRENCY-DENOMINATED BONDS.

THE

MEASUREMENT OF THE ACCUMULATED POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATION ASSUMES A HEALTH CARE COST TREND RATE OF 4.5 PERCENT FOR 2006 THAT DECLINES TO 2.5 PERCENT BY 2011. A ONE-PERCENTAGE-POINT INCREASE IN THE HEALTH CARE COST TREND RATE WOULD INCREASE

SERVICE AND INTEREST COST BY $32 MILLION AND THE POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATION BY $352 MILLION. A ONE-PERCENTAGE-POINT DECREASE IN THE HEALTH CARE COST TREND RATE WOULD DECREASE SERVICE AND INTEREST COST BY $26 MILLION AND THE POSTRETIREMENT

BENEFIT OBLIGATION BY $299 MILLION.

THE CORPORATION OFFERS A MEDICARE SUPPLEMENT PLAN TO MEDICARE-ELIGIBLE RETIREES THAT PROVIDES

PRESCRIPTION DRUG BENEFITS. ON DECEMBER 8, 2003, THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES SIGNED INTO LAW THE MEDICARE PRESCRIPTION DRUG, IMPROVEMENT AND MODERNIZATION ACT OF 2003 (THE ACT). THE ACT PROVIDES A FEDERAL SUBSIDY TO EMPLOYERS

SPONSORING RETIREE HEALTH CARE BENEFIT PLANS THAT PROVIDE A BENEFIT THAT IS AT LEAST ACTUARIALLY EQUIVALENT TO MEDICARE PART D. THE CORPORATION BELIEVES THAT ITS MEDICARE SUPPLEMENT PLAN IS AT LEAST ACTUARIALLY EQUIVALENT TO MEDICARE PART D BUT THAT

IT IS NOT A SIGNIFICANT EVENT FOR THE PLAN. ACCORDINGLY, THE CORPORATION RECOGNIZED THE EFFECTS OF THE ACT AT THE DECEMBER 31, 2004, MEASUREMENT DATE WHICH REDUCED THE YEAR-END 2004 BENEFIT OBLIGATION BY $383 MILLION AND THE 2005 NET BENEFIT

COST BY $57 MILLION.

THE DATA ON THE PRECEDING PAGE CONFORM WITH CURRENT ACCOUNTING STANDARDS THAT SPECIFY USE OF A

DISCOUNT RATE AT WHICH POSTRETIREMENT LIABILITIES COULD BE EFFECTIVELY SETTLED. THE DISCOUNT RATE FOR CALCULATING YEAR-END POSTRETIREMENT LIABILITIES IS BASED ON THE YEAR-END RATE OF INTEREST ON A PORTFOLIO OF HIGH-QUALITY BONDS. THE RETURN ON THE

ANNUITY FUNDS ACTUAL PORTFOLIO OF ASSETS HAS HISTORICALLY BEEN HIGHER THAN BONDS AS THE MAJORITY OF PENSION ASSETS ARE INVESTED IN EQUITIES, AS ILLUSTRATED IN THE TABLE BELOW, WHICH SHOWS ASSET ALLOCATION. THE U.S. LONG-TERM EXPECTED RATE OF

RETURN OF 9.0 PERCENT USED IN 2005 COMPARES TO AN ACTUAL RATE OF RETURN FOR THE U.S. ANNUITY FUND OVER THE PAST DECADE OF 11 PERCENT. THE CORPORATION ESTABLISHES THE LONG-TERM EXPECTED RATE OF RETURN FOR EACH PLAN BY DEVELOPING A FORWARD-LOOKING,

LONG-TERM RETURN ASSUMPTION FOR EACH ASSET CLASS, TAKING INTO ACCOUNT FACTORS SUCH AS THE EXPECTED REAL RETURN FOR THE SPECIFIC ASSET CLASS AND INFLATION. A SINGLE, LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN IS THEN CALCULATED AS THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE OF THE TARGET

ASSET ALLOCATION AND THE LONG-TERM RETURN ASSUMPTION FOR EACH ASSET CLASS.

THE CORPORATIONS INVESTMENT STRATEGY FOR BENEFIT PLAN ASSETS REFLECTS A LONG-TERM VIEW, A

CAREFUL ASSESSMENT OF THE RISKS INHERENT IN VARIOUS ASSET CLASSES AND BROAD DIVERSIFICATION TO REDUCE THE RISK OF THE PORTFOLIO. THE CORPORATION PRIMARILY INVESTS IN FUNDS THAT FOLLOW AN INDEX-BASED STRATEGY TO ACHIEVE ITS OBJECTIVES OF DIVERSIFYING

RISK WHILE MINIMIZING COSTS. THE FUNDS HOLD EXXONMOBIL STOCK ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO REPLICATE THE RELEVANT EQUITY INDEX. ASSET-LIABILITY STUDIES, OR SIMULATIONS OF THE INTERACTION OF CASH FLOWS ASSOCIATED WITH BOTH ASSETS AND LIABILITIES,

ARE PERIODICALLY USED TO ESTABLISH THE PREFERRED TARGET ASSET ALLOCATION. THE TARGET ASSET ALLOCATION FOR EQUITY SECURITIES OF 75 PERCENT FOR THE U.S. BENEFIT PLANS AND 67 PERCENT FOR NON-U.S. PLANS REFLECTS THE LONG-TERM NATURE OF THE LIABILITY.

THE BALANCE OF THE FUNDS IS LARGELY TARGETED TO DEBT SECURITIES.

INDEX TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

THE FUNDING LEVELS OF ALL QUALIFIED PLANS ARE IN COMPLIANCE WITH STANDARDS SET BY APPLICABLE LAW OR REGULATION. CERTAIN SMALLER U.S. PLANS AND A NUMBER OF

NON-U.S. PLANS ARE NOT FUNDED BECAUSE LOCAL TAX CONVENTIONS AND REGULATORY PRACTICES DO NOT ENCOURAGE FUNDING OF THESE PLANS. ALL DEFINED-BENEFIT PENSION OBLIGATIONS, REGARDLESS OF THE FUNDING STATUS OF THE UNDERLYING PLANS, ARE FULLY SUPPORTED BY

THE FINANCIAL STRENGTH OF THE CORPORATION OR THE RESPECTIVE SPONSORING AFFILIATE.

16. DISCLOSURES ABOUT SEGMENTS AND RELATED INFORMATION

THE UPSTREAM, DOWNSTREAM AND CHEMICAL FUNCTIONS BEST DEFINE THE

OPERATING SEGMENTS OF THE BUSINESS THAT ARE REPORTED SEPARATELY. THE FACTORS USED TO IDENTIFY THESE REPORTABLE SEGMENTS ARE BASED ON THE NATURE OF THE OPERATIONS THAT ARE UNDERTAKEN BY EACH SEGMENT. THE UPSTREAM SEGMENT IS ORGANIZED AND OPERATES TO

EXPLORE FOR AND PRODUCE CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS. THE DOWNSTREAM SEGMENT IS ORGANIZED AND OPERATES TO MANUFACTURE AND SELL PETROLEUM PRODUCTS. THE CHEMICAL SEGMENT IS ORGANIZED AND OPERATES TO MANUFACTURE AND SELL PETROCHEMICALS. THESE SEGMENTS ARE

BROADLY UNDERSTOOD ACROSS THE PETROLEUM AND PETROCHEMICAL INDUSTRIES.

THESE FUNCTIONS HAVE BEEN DEFINED AS THE OPERATING SEGMENTS OF THE

CORPORATION BECAUSE THEY ARE THE SEGMENTS (A) THAT ENGAGE IN BUSINESS ACTIVITIES FROM WHICH REVENUES ARE EARNED AND EXPENSES ARE INCURRED; (B) WHOSE OPERATING RESULTS ARE REGULARLY REVIEWED BY THE CORPORATIONS CHIEF OPERATING

DECISION MAKER TO MAKE DECISIONS ABOUT RESOURCES TO BE ALLOCATED TO THE SEGMENT AND ASSESS ITS PERFORMANCE; AND (C) FOR WHICH DISCRETE FINANCIAL INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE.

EARNINGS AFTER INCOME TAX INCLUDE SPECIAL ITEMS AND TRANSFERS ARE AT ESTIMATED MARKET PRICES. SPECIAL ITEMS INCLUDED IN 2005 AFTER-TAX EARNINGS ARE A

$1,620 MILLION GAIN IN NON-U.S. UPSTREAM FOR THE RESTRUCTURING OF A DUTCH GAS EQUITY COMPANY, A $390 MILLION GAIN IN NON-U.S. CHEMICAL RELATING TO JOINT VENTURE LITIGATION, GAINS OF $310 MILLION AND $150 MILLION IN NON-U.S. DOWNSTREAM AND NON-U.S.

CHEMICAL, RESPECTIVELY, FOR THE SINOPEC SHARE SALE AND A CHARGE OF $200 MILLION IN U.S. DOWNSTREAM RELATING TO THE ALLAPATTAH LAWSUIT PROVISION. U.S. DOWNSTREAM AFTER-TAX EARNINGS IN 2004 INCLUDED A CHARGE OF $550 MILLION RELATING TO ALLAPATTAH.

UPSTREAM EARNINGS IN 2003 INCLUDE $1,700 MILLION FROM A GAIN ON THE TRANSFER OF SHARES IN RUHRGAS AG, A GERMAN GAS TRANSMISSION COMPANY. ALL OTHER AFTER-TAX EARNINGS IN 2003 INCLUDE $2,230 MILLION RELATING TO THE POSITIVE SETTLEMENT OF A

LONG-RUNNING U.S. TAX DISPUTE. ALL OTHER AFTER-TAX EARNINGS IN 2003 ALSO INCLUDE A $550 MILLION POSITIVE IMPACT FOR THE REQUIRED ADOPTION OF FAS 143 RELATING TO ACCOUNTING FOR ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS.

INTEREST EXPENSE INCLUDES NON-DEBT RELATED INTEREST EXPENSE OF $369 MILLION, $529 MILLION AND $106 MILLION IN 2005, 2004 AND 2003, RESPECTIVELY. THE

INCREASE OF $423 MILLION FROM 2003 TO 2004 PRIMARILY REFLECTS THE INTEREST COMPONENT OF THE ALLAPATTAH LAWSUIT PROVISION. THE SUBSEQUENT DECREASE OF $160 MILLION IN 2005 REFLECTS A LOWER INTEREST COMPONENT FOR ALLAPATTAH.

THE OTHER SEGMENT INCLUDES CORPORATE AND FINANCING ACTIVITIES. THE INTEREST REVENUE AMOUNT RELATES TO INTEREST EARNED ON CASH DEPOSITS AND MARKETABLE

SECURITIES.

AVERAGE SALES PRICES HAVE BEEN CALCULATED BY USING SALES QUANTITIES FROM THE CORPORATIONS OWN

PRODUCTION AS THE DIVISOR. AVERAGE PRODUCTION COSTS HAVE BEEN COMPUTED BY USING NET PRODUCTION QUANTITIES FOR THE DIVISOR. THE VOLUMES OF CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS LIQUIDS (NGL) PRODUCTION USED FOR THIS COMPUTATION ARE SHOWN IN THE RESERVES TABLE ON

PAGE 81 OF THIS REPORT. THE VOLUMES FOR NATURAL GAS USED FOR THIS CALCULATION ARE THE PRODUCTION VOLUMES OF NATURAL GAS AVAILABLE FOR SALE AND THUS ARE DIFFERENT THAN THOSE SHOWN IN THE RESERVES TABLE ON PAGE 82 OF THIS REPORT DUE TO VOLUMES

CONSUMED OR FLARED. THE VOLUMES OF NATURAL GAS WERE CONVERTED TO OIL-EQUIVALENT BARRELS BASED ON A CONVERSION FACTOR OF SIX THOUSAND CUBIC FEET PER BARREL.

SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION ON OIL AND GAS EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION ACTIVITIES

(UNAUDITED)

OIL AND GAS RESERVES

THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION

DESCRIBES CHANGES DURING THE YEARS AND BALANCES OF PROVED OIL AND GAS RESERVES AT YEAR-END 2003, 2004 AND 2005.

THE DEFINITIONS USED ARE

IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSIONS RULE 4-10(A) OF REGULATION S-X, PARAGRAPHS (2) THROUGH (2)III, (3) AND (4).

PROVED OIL AND GAS RESERVES ARE THE ESTIMATED QUANTITIES OF CRUDE OIL, NATURAL GAS AND NATURAL GAS LIQUIDS THAT GEOLOGICAL AND ENGINEERING DATA DEMONSTRATE WITH REASONABLE CERTAINTY TO BE RECOVERABLE IN FUTURE YEARS

FROM KNOWN RESERVOIRS UNDER EXISTING ECONOMIC AND OPERATING CONDITIONS, I.E., PRICES AND COSTS AS OF THE DATE THE ESTIMATE IS MADE. PRICES INCLUDE CONSIDERATION OF CHANGES IN EXISTING PRICES PROVIDED ONLY BY CONTRACTUAL ARRANGEMENTS BUT NOT ON

ESCALATIONS BASED UPON FUTURE CONDITIONS. IN SOME CASES, SUBSTANTIAL NEW INVESTMENTS IN ADDITIONAL WELLS AND RELATED FACILITIES WILL BE REQUIRED TO RECOVER THESE PROVED RESERVES.

BASED ON REGULATORY GUIDANCE, THE CORPORATION BEGAN REPORTING PROVED RESERVES IN 2004 ON THE BASIS OF DECEMBER 31 PRICES AND COSTS (YEAR-END

PRICES).

THE USE OF YEAR-END PRICES FOR RESERVES ESTIMATION INTRODUCES SHORT-TERM PRICE VOLATILITY INTO THE PROCESS SINCE ANNUAL

ADJUSTMENTS ARE REQUIRED BASED ON PRICES OCCURRING ON A SINGLE DAY. THE CORPORATION BELIEVES THAT THIS APPROACH IS INCONSISTENT WITH THE LONG-TERM NATURE OF THE UPSTREAM BUSINESS WHERE PRODUCTION FROM INDIVIDUAL PROJECTS OFTEN SPANS MULTIPLE

DECADES. THE USE OF PRICES FROM A SINGLE DATE IS NOT RELEVANT TO THE INVESTMENT DECISIONS MADE BY THE CORPORATION AND ANNUAL VARIATIONS IN RESERVES BASED ON SUCH YEAR-END PRICES ARE NOT OF CONSEQUENCE TO HOW THE BUSINESS IS ACTUALLY MANAGED.

REVISIONS CAN INCLUDE UPWARD OR DOWNWARD CHANGES IN PREVIOUSLY ESTIMATED VOLUMES OF PROVED RESERVES FOR EXISTING FIELDS DUE TO THE

EVALUATION OR RE-EVALUATION OF (1) ALREADY AVAILABLE GEOLOGIC, RESERVOIR OR PRODUCTION DATA OR (2) NEW GEOLOGIC, RESERVOIR OR PRODUCTION DATA, OR (3) CHANGES TO UNDERLYING PRICE ASSUMPTIONS USED IN THE DETERMINATION OF RESERVES. THIS

CATEGORY CAN ALSO INCLUDE CHANGES ASSOCIATED WITH THE PERFORMANCE OF IMPROVED RECOVERY PROJECTS AND SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN EITHER DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY OR PRODUCTION EQUIPMENT/FACILITY CAPACITY.

PROVED RESERVES INCLUDE 100 PERCENT OF EACH MAJORITY-OWNED AFFILIATES PARTICIPATION IN PROVED RESERVES AND EXXONMOBILS OWNERSHIP PERCENTAGE

OF THE PROVED RESERVES OF EQUITY COMPANIES, BUT EXCLUDE ROYALTIES AND QUANTITIES DUE OTHERS. GAS RESERVES EXCLUDE THE GASEOUS EQUIVALENT OF LIQUIDS EXPECTED TO BE REMOVED FROM THE GAS ON LEASES, AT FIELD FACILITIES AND AT GAS PROCESSING PLANTS.

THESE LIQUIDS ARE INCLUDED IN NET PROVED RESERVES OF CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS LIQUIDS.

IN THE RESERVES TABLES ON PAGES 81 TO 83,

CONSOLIDATED RESERVES AND EQUITY RESERVES ARE REPORTED SEPARATELY. HOWEVER, THE CORPORATION DOES NOT VIEW EQUITY RESERVES ANY DIFFERENTLY THAN THOSE FROM CONSOLIDATED COMPANIES.

RESERVES REPORTED UNDER PRODUCTION SHARING AND OTHER NONCONCESSIONARY AGREEMENTS ARE BASED ON THE ECONOMIC INTEREST AS DEFINED BY THE SPECIFIC FISCAL

TERMS IN THE AGREEMENT. THE PERCENTAGE OF CONVENTIONAL LIQUIDS AND NATURAL GAS PROVED RESERVES (CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES PLUS EQUITY COMPANIES) AT YEAR-END 2005 THAT WERE ASSOCIATED WITH PRODUCTION SHARING CONTRACT ARRANGEMENTS WAS 17 PERCENT OF

LIQUIDS, 10 PERCENT OF NATURAL GAS AND 13 PERCENT ON AN OIL-EQUIVALENT BASIS (GAS CONVERTED TO OIL-EQUIVALENT AT 6 BILLION CUBIC FEET = 1 MILLION BARRELS).

NET PROVED DEVELOPED RESERVES ARE THOSE VOLUMES THAT ARE EXPECTED TO BE RECOVERED THROUGH EXISTING WELLS WITH EXISTING EQUIPMENT AND OPERATING METHODS. UNDEVELOPED RESERVES ARE THOSE VOLUMES THAT ARE EXPECTED TO BE

RECOVERED AS A RESULT OF FUTURE INVESTMENTS TO DRILL NEW WELLS, TO RECOMPLETE EXISTING WELLS AND/OR TO INSTALL FACILITIES TO COLLECT AND DELIVER THE PRODUCTION FROM EXISTING AND FUTURE WELLS.

CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS LIQUIDS AND NATURAL GAS PRODUCTION QUANTITIES SHOWN ARE THE NET VOLUMES WITHDRAWN FROM EXXONMOBILS OIL AND GAS RESERVES.

THE NATURAL GAS QUANTITIES DIFFER FROM THE QUANTITIES OF GAS DELIVERED FOR SALE BY THE PRODUCING FUNCTION AS REPORTED ON PAGE 86 DUE TO VOLUMES CONSUMED OR FLARED AND INVENTORY CHANGES.

RESERVES NOT INCLUDED ABOVE

IN ADDITION TO CONVENTIONAL LIQUIDS AND NATURAL GAS PROVED RESERVES, EXXONMOBIL HAS SIGNIFICANT INTERESTS IN PROVEN TAR

SANDS RESERVES IN CANADA ASSOCIATED WITH THE SYNCRUDE PROJECT. FOR INTERNAL MANAGEMENT PURPOSES, EXXONMOBIL VIEWS THESE RESERVES AND THEIR DEVELOPMENT AS AN INTEGRAL PART OF TOTAL UPSTREAM OPERATIONS. HOWEVER, FOR FINANCIAL REPORTING PURPOSES, THESE

RESERVES ARE REQUIRED TO BE REPORTED SEPARATELY FROM THE OIL AND GAS RESERVES.

THE TAR SANDS RESERVES ARE NOT CONSIDERED IN THE

STANDARDIZED MEASURE OF DISCOUNTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS FOR CONVENTIONAL OIL AND GAS RESERVES, WHICH IS FOUND ON PAGE 84.

STANDARDIZED MEASURE OF DISCOUNTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS

AS REQUIRED BY

THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD, THE STANDARDIZED MEASURE OF DISCOUNTED FUTURE NET CASH FLOWS IS COMPUTED BY APPLYING YEAR-END PRICES, COSTS AND LEGISLATED TAX RATES AND A DISCOUNT FACTOR OF 10 PERCENT TO NET PROVED RESERVES. THE

STANDARDIZED MEASURE INCLUDES COSTS FOR FUTURE DISMANTLEMENT, ABANDONMENT AND REHABILITATION OBLIGATIONS. THE CORPORATION BELIEVES THE STANDARDIZED MEASURE DOES NOT PROVIDE A RELIABLE ESTIMATE OF THE CORPORATIONS EXPECTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS TO

BE OBTAINED FROM THE DEVELOPMENT AND PRODUCTION OF ITS OIL AND GAS PROPERTIES OR OF THE VALUE OF ITS PROVED OIL AND GAS RESERVES. THE STANDARDIZED MEASURE IS PREPARED ON THE BASIS OF CERTAIN PRESCRIBED ASSUMPTIONS INCLUDING YEAR-END PRICES, WHICH

REPRESENT A SINGLE POINT IN TIME AND THEREFORE MAY CAUSE SIGNIFICANT VARIABILITY IN CASH FLOWS FROM YEAR TO YEAR AS PRICES CHANGE.
