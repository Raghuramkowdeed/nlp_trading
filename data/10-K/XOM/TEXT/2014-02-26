ITEM 1.

BUSINESS

EXXON MOBIL CORPORATION WAS INCORPORATED IN THE STATE

OF NEW JERSEY IN 1882. DIVISIONS AND AFFILIATED COMPANIES OF EXXONMOBIL OPERATE

OR MARKET PRODUCTS IN THE UNITED STATES AND MOST OTHER COUNTRIES OF THE WORLD.

THEIR PRINCIPAL BUSINESS IS ENERGY, INVOLVING EXPLORATION FOR, AND PRODUCTION

OF, CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS, MANUFACTURE OF PETROLEUM PRODUCTS AND

TRANSPORTATION AND SALE OF CRUDE OIL, NATURAL GAS AND PETROLEUM PRODUCTS.

EXXONMOBIL IS A MAJOR MANUFACTURER AND MARKETER OF COMMODITY PETROCHEMICALS,

INCLUDING OLEFINS, AROMATICS, POLYETHYLENE AND POLYPROPYLENE PLASTICS AND A

WIDE VARIETY OF SPECIALTY PRODUCTS. EXXONMOBIL ALSO HAS INTERESTS IN ELECTRIC

POWER GENERATION FACILITIES. AFFILIATES OF EXXONMOBIL CONDUCT EXTENSIVE

RESEARCH PROGRAMS IN SUPPORT OF THESE BUSINESSES.

EXXON MOBIL CORPORATION HAS SEVERAL DIVISIONS AND

HUNDREDS OF AFFILIATES, MANY WITH NAMES THAT INCLUDE

EXXONMOBIL

,

EXXON

,

ESSO, MOBIL

OR

XTO

. FOR CONVENIENCE AND SIMPLICITY, IN THIS

REPORT THE TERMS

EXXONMOBIL, EXXON, ESSO, MOBIL

AND

XTO

, AS WELL

AS TERMS LIKE

CORPORATION

,

COMPANY

,

OUR

,

WE

AND

ITS

,

ARE SOMETIMES USED AS ABBREVIATED REFERENCES TO SPECIFIC AFFILIATES OR GROUPS

OF AFFILIATES. THE PRECISE MEANING DEPENDS ON THE CONTEXT IN QUESTION.

THROUGHOUT EXXONMOBIL’S BUSINESSES, NEW AND ONGOING

MEASURES ARE TAKEN TO PREVENT AND MINIMIZE THE IMPACT OF OUR OPERATIONS ON AIR,

WATER AND GROUND. THESE INCLUDE A SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT IN REFINING

INFRASTRUCTURE AND TECHNOLOGY TO MANUFACTURE CLEAN FUELS AS WELL AS PROJECTS TO

MONITOR AND REDUCE NITROGEN OXIDE, SULFUR OXIDE, AND GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS AND

EXPENDITURES FOR ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS.  USING DEFINITIONS AND

GUIDELINES ESTABLISHED BY THE AMERICAN PETROLEUM INSTITUTE, EXXONMOBIL’S 2013

WORLDWIDE ENVIRONMENTAL EXPENDITURES FOR ALL SUCH PREVENTATIVE AND REMEDIATION

STEPS, INCLUDING EXXONMOBIL’S SHARE OF EQUITY COMPANY EXPENDITURES, WERE $6.0 BILLION,

OF WHICH $3.5 BILLION WERE INCLUDED IN EXPENSES WITH THE REMAINDER IN

CAPITAL EXPENDITURES. THE TOTAL COST FOR SUCH ACTIVITIES IS EXPECTED TO REMAIN

IN THIS RANGE IN 2014 AND 2015 (WITH CAPITAL EXPENDITURES APPROXIMATELY 45 PERCENT

OF THE TOTAL).

THE ENERGY AND PETROCHEMICAL INDUSTRIES ARE HIGHLY

COMPETITIVE. THERE IS COMPETITION WITHIN THE INDUSTRIES AND ALSO WITH OTHER

INDUSTRIES IN SUPPLYING THE ENERGY, FUEL AND CHEMICAL NEEDS OF BOTH INDUSTRIAL

AND INDIVIDUAL CONSUMERS. THE CORPORATION COMPETES WITH OTHER FIRMS IN THE SALE

OR PURCHASE OF NEEDED GOODS AND SERVICES IN MANY NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL

MARKETS AND EMPLOYS ALL METHODS OF COMPETITION WHICH ARE LAWFUL AND APPROPRIATE

FOR SUCH PURPOSES.

OPERATING DATA AND INDUSTRY SEGMENT INFORMATION FOR

THE CORPORATION ARE CONTAINED IN THE FINANCIAL SECTION OF THIS REPORT UNDER THE

FOLLOWING: “QUARTERLY INFORMATION”, “NOTE 18: DISCLOSURES ABOUT SEGMENTS

AND RELATED INFORMATION” AND “OPERATING SUMMARY”. INFORMATION ON OIL AND GAS

RESERVES IS CONTAINED IN THE “OIL AND GAS RESERVES” PART OF THE “SUPPLEMENTAL

INFORMATION ON OIL AND GAS EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION ACTIVITIES” PORTION OF

THE FINANCIAL SECTION OF THIS REPORT.

EXXONMOBIL HAS A LONG-STANDING COMMITMENT TO THE

DEVELOPMENT OF PROPRIETARY TECHNOLOGY. WE HAVE A WIDE ARRAY OF RESEARCH

PROGRAMS DESIGNED TO MEET THE NEEDS IDENTIFIED IN EACH OF OUR BUSINESS

SEGMENTS. INFORMATION ON COMPANY-SPONSORED RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT SPENDING IS

CONTAINED IN “NOTE 3: MISCELLANEOUS FINANCIAL INFORMATION” OF THE

FINANCIAL SECTION OF THIS REPORT. EXXONMOBIL HELD APPROXIMATELY 11 THOUSAND

ACTIVE PATENTS WORLDWIDE AT THE END OF 2013. FOR TECHNOLOGY LICENSED TO THIRD

PARTIES, REVENUES TOTALED APPROXIMATELY $195 MILLION IN 2013. ALTHOUGH

TECHNOLOGY IS AN IMPORTANT CONTRIBUTOR TO THE OVERALL OPERATIONS AND RESULTS OF

OUR COMPANY, THE PROFITABILITY OF EACH BUSINESS SEGMENT IS NOT DEPENDENT ON ANY

INDIVIDUAL PATENT, TRADE SECRET, TRADEMARK, LICENSE, FRANCHISE OR CONCESSION.

THE NUMBER OF REGULAR EMPLOYEES WAS 75.0 THOUSAND, 76.9

THOUSAND AND 82.1 THOUSAND AT YEARS ENDED 2013, 2012 AND 2011, RESPECTIVELY.

REGULAR EMPLOYEES ARE DEFINED AS ACTIVE EXECUTIVE, MANAGEMENT, PROFESSIONAL,

TECHNICAL AND WAGE EMPLOYEES WHO WORK FULL TIME OR PART TIME FOR THE

CORPORATION AND ARE COVERED BY THE CORPORATION’S BENEFIT PLANS AND PROGRAMS.

REGULAR EMPLOYEES DO NOT INCLUDE EMPLOYEES OF THE COMPANY-OPERATED RETAIL SITES

(CORS). THE NUMBER OF CORS EMPLOYEES WAS 9.8 THOUSAND, 11.1 THOUSAND AND 17.0

THOUSAND AT YEARS ENDED 2013, 2012 AND 2011, RESPECTIVELY.

1

ITEM 1A.       RISK

FACTORS

EXXONMOBIL’S FINANCIAL AND OPERATING

RESULTS ARE SUBJECT TO A VARIETY OF RISKS INHERENT IN THE GLOBAL OIL, GAS, AND

PETROCHEMICAL BUSINESSES. MANY OF THESE RISK FACTORS ARE NOT WITHIN THE

COMPANY’S CONTROL AND COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, OUR FINANCIAL AND

OPERATING RESULTS OR OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION. THESE RISK FACTORS INCLUDE.

SUPPLY AND DEMAND

THE OIL, GAS, AND PETROCHEMICAL BUSINESSES ARE

FUNDAMENTALLY COMMODITY BUSINESSES. THIS MEANS EXXONMOBIL’S OPERATIONS AND

EARNINGS MAY BE SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTED BY CHANGES IN OIL, GAS AND PETROCHEMICAL

PRICES AND BY CHANGES IN MARGINS ON REFINED PRODUCTS. OIL, GAS, PETROCHEMICAL

AND PRODUCT PRICES AND MARGINS IN TURN DEPEND ON LOCAL, REGIONAL AND GLOBAL

EVENTS OR CONDITIONS THAT AFFECT SUPPLY AND DEMAND FOR THE RELEVANT COMMODITY.

ECONOMIC CONDITIONS.

THE DEMAND FOR ENERGY AND PETROCHEMICALS CORRELATES CLOSELY WITH

GENERAL ECONOMIC GROWTH RATES. THE OCCURRENCE OF RECESSIONS OR OTHER PERIODS OF

LOW OR NEGATIVE ECONOMIC GROWTH WILL TYPICALLY HAVE A DIRECT ADVERSE IMPACT ON

OUR RESULTS. OTHER FACTORS THAT AFFECT GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS IN THE WORLD

OR IN A MAJOR REGION, SUCH AS CHANGES IN POPULATION GROWTH RATES, PERIODS OF

CIVIL UNREST, GOVERNMENT AUSTERITY PROGRAMS, OR CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE

FLUCTUATIONS, CAN ALSO IMPACT THE DEMAND FOR ENERGY AND PETROCHEMICALS.

SOVEREIGN DEBT DOWNGRADES, DEFAULTS, INABILITY TO ACCESS DEBT MARKETS DUE TO

CREDIT OR LEGAL CONSTRAINTS, LIQUIDITY CRISES, THE BREAKUP OR RESTRUCTURING OF

FISCAL, MONETARY, OR POLITICAL SYSTEMS SUCH AS THE EUROPEAN UNION, AND OTHER

EVENTS OR CONDITIONS THAT IMPAIR THE FUNCTIONING OF FINANCIAL MARKETS AND

INSTITUTIONS ALSO POSE RISKS TO EXXONMOBIL, INCLUDING RISKS TO THE SAFETY OF

OUR FINANCIAL ASSETS AND TO THE ABILITY OF OUR PARTNERS AND CUSTOMERS TO

FULFILL THEIR COMMITMENTS TO EXXONMOBIL.

OTHER DEMAND-RELATED FACTORS.

OTHER FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT THE DEMAND FOR OIL, GAS

AND PETROCHEMICALS, AND THEREFORE IMPACT OUR RESULTS, INCLUDE TECHNOLOGICAL

IMPROVEMENTS IN ENERGY EFFICIENCY; SEASONAL WEATHER PATTERNS, WHICH AFFECT THE

DEMAND FOR ENERGY ASSOCIATED WITH HEATING AND COOLING; INCREASED

COMPETITIVENESS OF ALTERNATIVE ENERGY SOURCES THAT HAVE SO FAR GENERALLY NOT

BEEN COMPETITIVE WITH OIL AND GAS WITHOUT THE BENEFIT OF GOVERNMENT SUBSIDIES

OR MANDATES; AND CHANGES IN TECHNOLOGY OR CONSUMER PREFERENCES THAT ALTER FUEL

CHOICES, SUCH AS TOWARD ALTERNATIVE FUELED VEHICLES.

OTHER SUPPLY-RELATED FACTORS.

COMMODITY PRICES AND MARGINS ALSO VARY DEPENDING ON A

NUMBER OF FACTORS AFFECTING SUPPLY. FOR EXAMPLE, INCREASED SUPPLY FROM THE

DEVELOPMENT OF NEW OIL AND GAS SUPPLY SOURCES AND TECHNOLOGIES TO ENHANCE

RECOVERY FROM EXISTING SOURCES TEND TO REDUCE COMMODITY PRICES TO THE EXTENT

SUCH SUPPLY INCREASES ARE NOT OFFSET BY COMMENSURATE GROWTH IN DEMAND. SIMILARLY,

INCREASES IN INDUSTRY REFINING OR PETROCHEMICAL MANUFACTURING CAPACITY TEND TO

REDUCE MARGINS ON THE AFFECTED PRODUCTS. WORLD OIL, GAS, AND PETROCHEMICAL

SUPPLY LEVELS CAN ALSO BE AFFECTED BY FACTORS THAT REDUCE AVAILABLE SUPPLIES,

SUCH AS ADHERENCE BY MEMBER COUNTRIES TO OPEC PRODUCTION QUOTAS AND THE

OCCURRENCE OF WARS, HOSTILE ACTIONS, NATURAL DISASTERS, DISRUPTIONS IN

COMPETITORS’ OPERATIONS, OR UNEXPECTED UNAVAILABILITY OF DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS

THAT MAY DISRUPT SUPPLIES. TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE CAN ALSO ALTER THE RELATIVE

COSTS FOR COMPETITORS TO FIND, PRODUCE, AND REFINE OIL AND GAS AND TO

MANUFACTURE PETROCHEMICALS.

OTHER MARKET FACTORS.

EXXONMOBIL’S BUSINESS RESULTS ARE ALSO EXPOSED TO

POTENTIAL NEGATIVE IMPACTS DUE TO CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES, INFLATION,

CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES, AND OTHER LOCAL OR REGIONAL MARKET CONDITIONS. WE

GENERALLY DO NOT USE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS TO HEDGE MARKET EXPOSURES.

GOVERNMENT AND POLITICAL FACTORS

EXXONMOBIL’S RESULTS CAN BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY

POLITICAL OR REGULATORY DEVELOPMENTS AFFECTING OUR OPERATIONS.

ACCESS LIMITATIONS.

A NUMBER OF COUNTRIES LIMIT ACCESS TO THEIR OIL AND GAS RESOURCES, OR

MAY PLACE RESOURCES OFF-LIMITS FROM DEVELOPMENT ALTOGETHER. RESTRICTIONS ON

FOREIGN INVESTMENT IN THE OIL AND GAS SECTOR TEND TO INCREASE IN TIMES OF HIGH

COMMODITY PRICES, WHEN NATIONAL GOVERNMENTS MAY HAVE LESS NEED OF OUTSIDE

SOURCES OF PRIVATE CAPITAL. MANY COUNTRIES ALSO RESTRICT THE IMPORT OR EXPORT

OF CERTAIN PRODUCTS BASED ON POINT OF ORIGIN.

RESTRICTIONS ON DOING BUSINESS.

AS A U.S. COMPANY, EXXONMOBIL IS SUBJECT TO LAWS

PROHIBITING U.S. COMPANIES FROM DOING BUSINESS IN CERTAIN COUNTRIES, OR

RESTRICTING THE KIND OF BUSINESS THAT MAY BE CONDUCTED. SUCH RESTRICTIONS MAY

PROVIDE A COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE TO OUR NON-U.S. COMPETITORS UNLESS THEIR OWN

HOME COUNTRIES IMPOSE COMPARABLE RESTRICTIONS.

LACK OF LEGAL CERTAINTY.

SOME COUNTRIES IN WHICH WE DO BUSINESS LACK

WELL-DEVELOPED LEGAL SYSTEMS, OR HAVE NOT YET ADOPTED CLEAR REGULATORY

FRAMEWORKS FOR OIL AND GAS DEVELOPMENT. LACK OF LEGAL CERTAINTY EXPOSES OUR

OPERATIONS TO INCREASED RISK OF ADVERSE OR UNPREDICTABLE ACTIONS BY GOVERNMENT

OFFICIALS, AND ALSO MAKES IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR US TO ENFORCE OUR CONTRACTS. IN

SOME CASES THESE RISKS CAN BE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AGREEMENTS TO ARBITRATE

DISPUTES IN AN INTERNATIONAL FORUM, BUT THE ADEQUACY OF THIS REMEDY MAY STILL

DEPEND ON THE LOCAL LEGAL SYSTEM TO ENFORCE AN AWARD.

2

REGULATORY AND LITIGATION RISKS.

EVEN IN COUNTRIES WITH WELL-DEVELOPED LEGAL

SYSTEMS WHERE EXXONMOBIL DOES BUSINESS, WE REMAIN EXPOSED TO CHANGES IN LAW

(INCLUDING CHANGES THAT RESULT FROM INTERNATIONAL TREATIES AND ACCORDS) THAT

COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS, SUCH AS.

·

INCREASES IN TAXES OR GOVERNMENT ROYALTY RATES

(INCLUDING RETROACTIVE CLAIMS);

·

PRICE CONTROLS;

·

CHANGES IN ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS OR OTHER LAWS

THAT INCREASE OUR COST OF COMPLIANCE OR REDUCE OR DELAY AVAILABLE BUSINESS

OPPORTUNITIES (INCLUDING CHANGES IN LAWS RELATED TO OFFSHORE DRILLING

OPERATIONS, WATER USE, OR HYDRAULIC FRACTURING);

·

ADOPTION OF REGULATIONS MANDATING THE USE OF

ALTERNATIVE FUELS OR UNCOMPETITIVE FUEL COMPONENTS;

·

ADOPTION OF GOVERNMENT PAYMENT TRANSPARENCY

REGULATIONS THAT COULD REQUIRE US TO DISCLOSE COMPETITIVELY SENSITIVE

COMMERCIAL INFORMATION, OR THAT COULD CAUSE US TO VIOLATE THE NON-DISCLOSURE

LAWS OF OTHER COUNTRIES; AND

·

GOVERNMENT ACTIONS TO CANCEL CONTRACTS,

RE-DENOMINATE THE OFFICIAL CURRENCY, RENOUNCE OR DEFAULT ON OBLIGATIONS,

RENEGOTIATE TERMS UNILATERALLY, OR EXPROPRIATE ASSETS.

LEGAL REMEDIES AVAILABLE TO COMPENSATE US FOR

EXPROPRIATION OR OTHER TAKINGS MAY BE INADEQUATE.

WE ALSO MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY THE OUTCOME OF

LITIGATION, ESPECIALLY IN COUNTRIES SUCH AS THE UNITED STATES IN WHICH VERY

LARGE AND UNPREDICTABLE PUNITIVE DAMAGE AWARDS MAY OCCUR, OR BY GOVERNMENT

ENFORCEMENT PROCEEDINGS ALLEGING NON-COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE LAWS OR

REGULATIONS.

SECURITY CONCERNS.

SUCCESSFUL OPERATION OF PARTICULAR FACILITIES OR PROJECTS MAY BE

DISRUPTED BY CIVIL UNREST, ACTS OF SABOTAGE OR TERRORISM, AND OTHER LOCAL

SECURITY CONCERNS. SUCH CONCERNS MAY REQUIRE US TO INCUR GREATER COSTS FOR

SECURITY OR TO SHUT DOWN OPERATIONS FOR A PERIOD OF TIME.

CLIMATE CHANGE AND GREENHOUSE GAS RESTRICTIONS.

DUE TO CONCERN OVER THE RISK OF CLIMATE CHANGE, A

NUMBER OF COUNTRIES HAVE ADOPTED, OR ARE CONSIDERING THE ADOPTION OF,

REGULATORY FRAMEWORKS TO REDUCE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS. THESE INCLUDE

ADOPTION OF CAP AND TRADE REGIMES, CARBON TAXES, RESTRICTIVE PERMITTING,

INCREASED EFFICIENCY STANDARDS, AND INCENTIVES OR MANDATES FOR RENEWABLE

ENERGY. THESE REQUIREMENTS COULD MAKE OUR PRODUCTS MORE EXPENSIVE, LENGTHEN

PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION TIMES, AND REDUCE DEMAND FOR HYDROCARBONS, AS WELL AS

SHIFT HYDROCARBON DEMAND TOWARD RELATIVELY LOWER-CARBON SOURCES SUCH AS NATURAL

GAS. CURRENT AND PENDING GREENHOUSE GAS REGULATIONS MAY ALSO INCREASE OUR

COMPLIANCE COSTS, SUCH AS FOR MONITORING OR SEQUESTERING EMISSIONS.

GOVERNMENT SPONSORSHIP OF ALTERNATIVE ENERGY.

MANY GOVERNMENTS ARE PROVIDING TAX ADVANTAGES AND

OTHER SUBSIDIES TO SUPPORT ALTERNATIVE ENERGY SOURCES OR ARE MANDATING THE USE

OF SPECIFIC FUELS OR TECHNOLOGIES. GOVERNMENTS ARE ALSO PROMOTING RESEARCH INTO

NEW TECHNOLOGIES TO REDUCE THE COST AND INCREASE THE SCALABILITY OF ALTERNATIVE

ENERGY SOURCES. WE ARE CONDUCTING OUR OWN RESEARCH EFFORTS INTO ALTERNATIVE

ENERGY, SUCH AS THROUGH SPONSORSHIP OF THE GLOBAL CLIMATE AND ENERGY PROJECT AT

STANFORD UNIVERSITY AND RESEARCH INTO LIQUID PRODUCTS FROM ALGAE AND BIOMASS

THAT CAN BE FURTHER CONVERTED TO TRANSPORTATION FUELS. OUR FUTURE RESULTS MAY

DEPEND IN PART ON THE SUCCESS OF OUR RESEARCH EFFORTS AND ON OUR ABILITY TO

ADAPT AND APPLY THE STRENGTHS OF OUR CURRENT BUSINESS MODEL TO PROVIDING THE ENERGY

PRODUCTS OF THE FUTURE IN A COST-COMPETITIVE MANNER. SEE “MANAGEMENT

EFFECTIVENESS” BELOW.

MANAGEMENT EFFECTIVENESS

IN ADDITION TO EXTERNAL ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL

FACTORS, OUR FUTURE BUSINESS RESULTS ALSO DEPEND ON OUR ABILITY TO MANAGE

SUCCESSFULLY THOSE FACTORS THAT ARE AT LEAST IN PART WITHIN OUR CONTROL. THE

EXTENT TO WHICH WE MANAGE THESE FACTORS WILL IMPACT OUR PERFORMANCE RELATIVE TO

COMPETITION. FOR PROJECTS IN WHICH WE ARE NOT THE OPERATOR, WE DEPEND ON THE

MANAGEMENT EFFECTIVENESS OF ONE OR MORE CO-VENTURERS WHOM WE DO NOT CONTROL.

EXPLORATION AND DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM.

OUR ABILITY TO MAINTAIN AND GROW OUR OIL AND GAS

PRODUCTION DEPENDS ON THE SUCCESS OF OUR EXPLORATION AND DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS.

AMONG OTHER FACTORS, WE MUST CONTINUOUSLY IMPROVE OUR ABILITY TO IDENTIFY THE

MOST PROMISING RESOURCE PROSPECTS AND APPLY OUR PROJECT MANAGEMENT EXPERTISE TO

BRING DISCOVERED RESOURCES ON LINE ON SCHEDULE AND WITHIN BUDGET.

PROJECT MANAGEMENT.

THE SUCCESS OF EXXONMOBIL’S UPSTREAM, DOWNSTREAM, AND CHEMICAL

BUSINESSES DEPENDS ON COMPLEX, LONG-TERM, CAPITAL INTENSIVE PROJECTS. THESE

PROJECTS IN TURN REQUIRE A HIGH DEGREE OF PROJECT MANAGEMENT EXPERTISE TO

MAXIMIZE EFFICIENCY. SPECIFIC FACTORS THAT CAN AFFECT THE PERFORMANCE OF MAJOR

PROJECTS INCLUDE OUR ABILITY TO: NEGOTIATE SUCCESSFULLY WITH JOINT VENTURERS,

PARTNERS, GOVERNMENTS, SUPPLIERS, CUSTOMERS, OR OTHERS; MODEL AND OPTIMIZE

RESERVOIR PERFORMANCE; DEVELOP MARKETS FOR PROJECT OUTPUTS, WHETHER THROUGH

LONG-TERM CONTRACTS OR THE DEVELOPMENT OF EFFECTIVE SPOT MARKETS; MANAGE

CHANGES IN OPERATING CONDITIONS AND COSTS, INCLUDING COSTS OF THIRD PARTY

EQUIPMENT OR SERVICES SUCH AS DRILLING RIGS AND SHIPPING; PREVENT, TO THE

EXTENT POSSIBLE, AND RESPOND EFFECTIVELY TO UNFORESEEN TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES

THAT COULD DELAY PROJECT STARTUP OR CAUSE UNSCHEDULED PROJECT DOWNTIME; AND

INFLUENCE THE PERFORMANCE OF PROJECT OPERATORS WHERE EXXONMOBIL DOES NOT

PERFORM THAT ROLE.

3

THE TERM “PROJECT” AS USED

IN THIS REPORT CAN REFER TO A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT ACTIVITIES AND DOES NOT

NECESSARILY HAVE THE SAME MEANING AS IN ANY GOVERNMENT PAYMENT TRANSPARENCY REPORTS.

OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCY.

AN IMPORTANT COMPONENT OF EXXONMOBIL’S COMPETITIVE

PERFORMANCE, ESPECIALLY GIVEN THE COMMODITY-BASED NATURE OF MANY OF OUR

BUSINESSES, IS OUR ABILITY TO OPERATE EFFICIENTLY, INCLUDING OUR ABILITY TO

MANAGE EXPENSES AND IMPROVE PRODUCTION YIELDS ON AN ONGOING BASIS. THIS

REQUIRES CONTINUOUS MANAGEMENT FOCUS, INCLUDING TECHNOLOGY IMPROVEMENTS, COST

CONTROL, PRODUCTIVITY ENHANCEMENTS, REGULAR REAPPRAISAL OF OUR ASSET PORTFOLIO,

AND THE RECRUITMENT, DEVELOPMENT AND RETENTION OF HIGH CALIBER EMPLOYEES.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT.

TO MAINTAIN OUR COMPETITIVE POSITION, ESPECIALLY IN

LIGHT OF THE TECHNOLOGICAL NATURE OF OUR BUSINESSES AND THE NEED FOR CONTINUOUS

EFFICIENCY IMPROVEMENT, EXXONMOBIL’S RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ORGANIZATIONS

MUST BE SUCCESSFUL AND ABLE TO ADAPT TO A CHANGING MARKET AND POLICY

ENVIRONMENT.

SAFETY, BUSINESS CONTROLS, AND ENVIRONMENTAL RISK

MANAGEMENT.

OUR RESULTS DEPEND ON

MANAGEMENT’S ABILITY TO MINIMIZE THE INHERENT RISKS OF OIL, GAS, AND

PETROCHEMICAL OPERATIONS, TO CONTROL EFFECTIVELY OUR BUSINESS ACTIVITIES AND TO

MINIMIZE THE POTENTIAL FOR HUMAN ERROR. WE APPLY RIGOROUS MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS

AND CONTINUOUS FOCUS TO WORKPLACE SAFETY AND TO AVOIDING SPILLS OR OTHER

ADVERSE ENVIRONMENTAL EVENTS. FOR EXAMPLE, WE WORK TO MINIMIZE SPILLS THROUGH A

COMBINED PROGRAM OF EFFECTIVE OPERATIONS INTEGRITY MANAGEMENT, ONGOING

UPGRADES, KEY EQUIPMENT REPLACEMENTS, AND COMPREHENSIVE INSPECTION AND

SURVEILLANCE. SIMILARLY, WE ARE IMPLEMENTING COST-EFFECTIVE NEW TECHNOLOGIES

AND ADOPTING NEW OPERATING PRACTICES TO REDUCE AIR EMISSIONS, NOT ONLY IN

RESPONSE TO GOVERNMENT REQUIREMENTS BUT ALSO TO ADDRESS COMMUNITY PRIORITIES.

WE ALSO MAINTAIN A DISCIPLINED FRAMEWORK OF INTERNAL CONTROLS AND APPLY A

CONTROLS MANAGEMENT SYSTEM FOR MONITORING COMPLIANCE WITH THIS FRAMEWORK.

SUBSTANTIAL LIABILITIES AND OTHER ADVERSE IMPACTS COULD RESULT IF OUR

MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS AND CONTROLS DO NOT FUNCTION AS INTENDED. THE ABILITY TO

INSURE AGAINST SUCH RISKS IS LIMITED BY THE CAPACITY OF THE APPLICABLE

INSURANCE MARKETS, WHICH MAY NOT BE SUFFICIENT.

BUSINESS RISKS ALSO INCLUDE THE RISK OF CYBERSECURITY

BREACHES. IF OUR SYSTEMS FOR PROTECTING AGAINST CYBERSECURITY RISKS PROVE NOT

TO BE SUFFICIENT, EXXONMOBIL COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED SUCH AS BY HAVING ITS

BUSINESS SYSTEMS COMPROMISED, ITS PROPRIETARY INFORMATION ALTERED, LOST OR

STOLEN, OR ITS BUSINESS OPERATIONS DISRUPTED.

PREPAREDNESS.

OUR OPERATIONS MAY BE DISRUPTED BY SEVERE WEATHER EVENTS, NATURAL DISASTERS,

HUMAN ERROR, AND SIMILAR EVENTS. FOR EXAMPLE, HURRICANES MAY DAMAGE OUR

OFFSHORE PRODUCTION FACILITIES OR COASTAL REFINING AND PETROCHEMICAL PLANTS IN

VULNERABLE AREAS. OUR ABILITY TO MITIGATE THE ADVERSE IMPACTS OF THESE EVENTS

DEPENDS IN PART UPON THE EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR RIGOROUS DISASTER PREPAREDNESS

AND RESPONSE PLANNING, AS WELL AS BUSINESS CONTINUITY PLANNING.

PROJECTIONS, ESTIMATES AND DESCRIPTIONS OF

EXXONMOBIL’S PLANS AND OBJECTIVES INCLUDED OR INCORPORATED IN ITEMS 1, 1A, 2, 7

AND 7A OF THIS REPORT ARE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS. ACTUAL FUTURE RESULTS,

IN THE PRECEDING RESERVES INFORMATION, CONSOLIDATED

SUBSIDIARY AND EQUITY COMPANY RESERVES ARE REPORTED SEPARATELY. HOWEVER, THE

CORPORATION OPERATES ITS BUSINESS WITH THE SAME VIEW OF EQUITY COMPANY RESERVES

AS IT HAS FOR RESERVES FROM CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES.

THE CORPORATION’S OVERALL VOLUME CAPACITY OUTLOOK,

BASED ON PROJECTS COMING ON STREAM AS ANTICIPATED, IS FOR PRODUCTION CAPACITY

TO GROW OVER THE PERIOD 2014-2018. HOWEVER, ACTUAL VOLUMES WILL VARY FROM YEAR

TO YEAR DUE TO THE TIMING OF INDIVIDUAL PROJECT START-UPS, OPERATIONAL OUTAGES,

RESERVOIR PERFORMANCE, REGULATORY CHANGES, ASSET SALES, WEATHER EVENTS, PRICE

EFFECTS ON PRODUCTION SHARING CONTRACTS AND OTHER FACTORS AS DESCRIBED IN ITEM

1A—RISK FACTORS OF THIS REPORT.

THE ESTIMATION OF PROVED RESERVES, WHICH IS BASED ON

THE REQUIREMENT OF REASONABLE CERTAINTY, IS AN ONGOING PROCESS BASED ON

RIGOROUS TECHNICAL EVALUATIONS, COMMERCIAL AND MARKET ASSESSMENTS AND DETAILED

ANALYSIS OF WELL AND RESERVOIR INFORMATION SUCH AS FLOW RATES AND RESERVOIR

PRESSURE DECLINES. FURTHERMORE, THE CORPORATION ONLY RECORDS PROVED RESERVES

FOR PROJECTS WHICH HAVE RECEIVED SIGNIFICANT FUNDING COMMITMENTS BY MANAGEMENT

MADE TOWARD THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE RESERVES. ALTHOUGH THE CORPORATION IS REASONABLY

CERTAIN THAT PROVED RESERVES WILL BE PRODUCED, THE TIMING AND AMOUNT RECOVERED

CAN BE AFFECTED BY A NUMBER OF FACTORS INCLUDING COMPLETION OF DEVELOPMENT

PROJECTS, RESERVOIR PERFORMANCE, REGULATORY APPROVALS AND SIGNIFICANT CHANGES

IN PROJECTIONS OF LONG-TERM OIL AND GAS PRICE LEVELS.

B. TECHNOLOGIES USED IN ESTABLISHING PROVED

RESERVES ADDITIONS IN 2013

ADDITIONS TO EXXONMOBIL’S PROVED RESERVES IN 2013 WERE

BASED ON ESTIMATES GENERATED THROUGH THE INTEGRATION OF AVAILABLE AND

APPROPRIATE GEOLOGICAL, ENGINEERING AND PRODUCTION DATA, UTILIZING

WELL-ESTABLISHED TECHNOLOGIES THAT HAVE BEEN DEMONSTRATED IN THE FIELD TO YIELD

REPEATABLE AND CONSISTENT RESULTS.

DATA USED IN THESE INTEGRATED ASSESSMENTS INCLUDED

INFORMATION OBTAINED DIRECTLY FROM THE SUBSURFACE VIA WELLBORES, SUCH AS WELL

LOGS, RESERVOIR CORE SAMPLES, FLUID SAMPLES, STATIC AND DYNAMIC PRESSURE

INFORMATION, PRODUCTION TEST DATA, AND SURVEILLANCE AND PERFORMANCE

INFORMATION. THE DATA UTILIZED ALSO INCLUDED SUBSURFACE INFORMATION OBTAINED

THROUGH INDIRECT MEASUREMENTS INCLUDING HIGH-QUALITY 2-D AND 3-D SEISMIC DATA,

CALIBRATED WITH AVAILABLE WELL CONTROL INFORMATION. THE TOOLS USED TO INTERPRET

THE DATA INCLUDED PROPRIETARY SEISMIC PROCESSING SOFTWARE, PROPRIETARY

RESERVOIR MODELING AND SIMULATION SOFTWARE, AND COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE DATA

ANALYSIS PACKAGES.

IN SOME CIRCUMSTANCES, WHERE APPROPRIATE ANALOG

RESERVOIRS WERE AVAILABLE, RESERVOIR PARAMETERS FROM THESE ANALOGS WERE USED TO

INCREASE THE QUALITY OF AND CONFIDENCE IN THE RESERVES ESTIMATES.

C. QUALIFICATIONS OF RESERVES

TECHNICAL OVERSIGHT GROUP AND INTERNAL CONTROLS OVER PROVED RESERVES

EXXONMOBIL HAS A DEDICATED GLOBAL RESERVES GROUP THAT PROVIDES

TECHNICAL OVERSIGHT AND IS SEPARATE FROM THE OPERATING ORGANIZATION. PRIMARY

RESPONSIBILITIES OF THIS GROUP INCLUDE OVERSIGHT OF THE RESERVES ESTIMATION

PROCESS FOR COMPLIANCE WITH SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (SEC) RULES AND

REGULATIONS, REVIEW OF ANNUAL CHANGES IN RESERVES ESTIMATES, AND THE REPORTING

OF EXXONMOBIL’S PROVED RESERVES. THIS GROUP ALSO MAINTAINS THE OFFICIAL COMPANY

RESERVES ESTIMATES FOR EXXONMOBIL’S PROVED RESERVES OF CRUDE AND NATURAL GAS

LIQUIDS, BITUMEN, SYNTHETIC OIL AND NATURAL GAS. IN ADDITION, THE GROUP

PROVIDES TRAINING TO PERSONNEL INVOLVED IN THE RESERVES ESTIMATION AND

REPORTING PROCESS WITHIN EXXONMOBIL AND ITS AFFILIATES. THE MANAGER OF THE

GLOBAL RESERVES GROUP HAS MORE THAN 30 YEARS OF EXPERIENCE IN RESERVOIR

ENGINEERING AND RESERVES ASSESSMENT AND HAS A DEGREE IN ENGINEERING.  HE IS AN

ACTIVE MEMBER OF THE SOCIETY OF PETROLEUM ENGINEERS (SPE) AND PREVIOUSLY SERVED

ON THE SPE OIL AND GAS RESERVES COMMITTEE. THE GROUP IS MANAGED BY AND STAFFED

WITH INDIVIDUALS THAT HAVE AN AVERAGE OF MORE THAN 20 YEARS OF TECHNICAL

EXPERIENCE IN THE PETROLEUM INDUSTRY, INCLUDING EXPERTISE IN THE CLASSIFICATION

AND CATEGORIZATION OF RESERVES UNDER THE SEC GUIDELINES. THIS GROUP INCLUDES

INDIVIDUALS WHO HOLD ADVANCED DEGREES IN EITHER ENGINEERING OR GEOLOGY. SEVERAL

MEMBERS OF THE GROUP HOLD PROFESSIONAL REGISTRATIONS IN THEIR FIELD OF

EXPERTISE, AND MEMBERS HAVE SERVED ON THE SPE OIL AND GAS RESERVES COMMITTEE.

THE GLOBAL RESERVES GROUP MAINTAINS A CENTRAL DATABASE

CONTAINING THE OFFICIAL COMPANY RESERVES ESTIMATES. APPROPRIATE CONTROLS,

INCLUDING LIMITATIONS ON DATABASE ACCESS AND UPDATE CAPABILITIES, ARE IN PLACE

TO ENSURE DATA INTEGRITY WITHIN THIS CENTRAL DATABASE.  AN ANNUAL REVIEW OF THE

SYSTEM’S CONTROLS IS PERFORMED BY INTERNAL AUDIT. KEY COMPONENTS OF THE

RESERVES ESTIMATION PROCESS INCLUDE TECHNICAL EVALUATIONS AND ANALYSIS OF WELL

AND FIELD PERFORMANCE AND A RIGOROUS PEER REVIEW. NO CHANGES MAY BE MADE TO THE

RESERVES ESTIMATES IN THE CENTRAL DATABASE, INCLUDING ADDITIONS OF ANY NEW

INITIAL RESERVES ESTIMATES OR SUBSEQUENT REVISIONS, UNLESS THESE CHANGES HAVE

BEEN THOROUGHLY REVIEWED AND EVALUATED BY DULY AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL WITHIN THE

OPERATING ORGANIZATION. IN ADDITION, CHANGES TO RESERVES ESTIMATES THAT EXCEED

CERTAIN THRESHOLDS REQUIRE FURTHER REVIEW AND APPROVAL OF THE APPROPRIATE LEVEL

OF MANAGEMENT WITHIN THE OPERATING ORGANIZATION BEFORE THE CHANGES MAY BE MADE

IN THE CENTRAL DATABASE. ENDORSEMENT BY THE GLOBAL RESERVES GROUP FOR ALL PROVED

RESERVES CHANGES IS A MANDATORY COMPONENT OF THIS REVIEW PROCESS. AFTER ALL

CHANGES ARE MADE, REVIEWS ARE HELD WITH SENIOR MANAGEMENT FOR FINAL

ENDORSEMENT.

2. PROVED

UNDEVELOPED RESERVES

AT YEAR-END 2013, APPROXIMATELY 8.5 BILLION

OIL-EQUIVALENT BARRELS (GOEB) OF EXXONMOBIL’S PROVED RESERVES WERE CLASSIFIED

AS PROVED UNDEVELOPED. THIS REPRESENTS 34 PERCENT OF THE 25.2 GOEB REPORTED IN

PROVED RESERVES. THIS COMPARES TO THE 9.9 GOEB OF PROVED UNDEVELOPED RESERVES

REPORTED AT THE END OF 2012. THE NET DECREASE IS PRIMARILY DUE TO PROJECT

STARTUPS IN CANADA AND KAZAKHSTAN. DURING THE YEAR, EXXONMOBIL CONDUCTED

DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES IN OVER 100 FIELDS THAT RESULTED IN THE TRANSFER OF

APPROXIMATELY 1.9 GOEB FROM PROVED UNDEVELOPED TO PROVED DEVELOPED RESERVES BY

YEAR-END. THE LARGEST TRANSFERS WERE RELATED TO KEARL INITIAL DEVELOPMENT

STARTUP AND NEW PAD STEAM INJECTION IN THE COLD LAKE FIELD IN CANADA, KASHAGAN

FIELD STARTUP IN KAZAKHSTAN AND THE GRONINGEN COMPRESSION ASSESSMENT IN THE

NETHERLANDS.

ONE OF EXXONMOBIL’S REQUIREMENTS FOR REPORTING PROVED

RESERVES IS THAT MANAGEMENT HAS MADE SIGNIFICANT FUNDING COMMITMENTS TOWARD THE

DEVELOPMENT OF THE RESERVES. EXXONMOBIL HAS A DISCIPLINED INVESTMENT STRATEGY

AND MANY MAJOR FIELDS REQUIRE LONG LEAD-TIME IN ORDER TO BE DEVELOPED.

DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS TYPICALLY TAKE TWO TO FOUR YEARS FROM THE TIME OF FIRST

RECORDING OF PROVED RESERVES TO THE START OF PRODUCTION OF THESE RESERVES.

HOWEVER, THE DEVELOPMENT TIME FOR LARGE AND COMPLEX PROJECTS CAN EXCEED FIVE YEARS.

DURING 2013, DISCOVERIES AND EXTENSIONS RELATED TO NEW PROJECTS ADDED

APPROXIMATELY 0.7 GOEB OF PROVED UNDEVELOPED RESERVES. THE LARGEST OF THESE

ADDITIONS WERE RELATED TO PLANNED DRILLING IN THE UNITED STATES AND UPPER ZAKUM

FIELD EXPANSION IN ABU DHABI. OVERALL, INVESTMENTS OF $25.3 BILLION WERE MADE

BY THE CORPORATION DURING 2013 TO PROGRESS THE DEVELOPMENT OF REPORTED PROVED

UNDEVELOPED RESERVES, INCLUDING $22.7 BILLION FOR OIL AND GAS PRODUCING

ACTIVITIES AND AN ADDITIONAL $2.6 BILLION FOR OTHER NON-OIL AND GAS PRODUCING

ACTIVITIES SUCH AS THE CONSTRUCTION OF SUPPORT INFRASTRUCTURE AND OTHER RELATED

FACILITIES THAT WERE UNDERTAKEN TO PROGRESS THE DEVELOPMENT OF PROVED

UNDEVELOPED RESERVES. THESE INVESTMENTS REPRESENTED 66 PERCENT OF THE $38.2 BILLION

IN TOTAL REPORTED UPSTREAM CAPITAL AND EXPLORATION EXPENDITURES.

PROVED UNDEVELOPED RESERVES IN AUSTRALIA, PAPUA NEW

GUINEA, THE UNITED STATES, KAZAKHSTAN, NIGERIA, AND THE NETHERLANDS HAVE

REMAINED UNDEVELOPED FOR FIVE YEARS OR MORE PRIMARILY DUE TO CONSTRAINTS ON THE

CAPACITY OF INFRASTRUCTURE, THE PACE OF CO-VENTURER/GOVERNMENT FUNDING, AS WELL

AS THE TIME REQUIRED TO COMPLETE DEVELOPMENT FOR VERY LARGE PROJECTS. THE

CORPORATION IS REASONABLY CERTAIN THAT THESE PROVED RESERVES WILL BE PRODUCED;

HOWEVER, THE TIMING AND AMOUNT RECOVERED CAN BE AFFECTED BY A NUMBER OF FACTORS

INCLUDING COMPLETION OF DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS, RESERVOIR PERFORMANCE, REGULATORY

APPROVALS, AND SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN LONG-TERM OIL AND GAS PRICE LEVELS. OF THE

PROVED UNDEVELOPED RESERVES THAT HAVE BEEN REPORTED FOR FIVE OR MORE YEARS, 91

PERCENT ARE CONTAINED IN THE AFOREMENTIONED COUNTRIES.  THE LARGEST OF THESE IS

RELATED TO LNG/GAS PROJECTS IN AUSTRALIA AND PAPUA NEW GUINEA, WHERE

CONSTRUCTION OF THE INITIAL DEVELOPMENT IS UNDER WAY. IN KAZAKHSTAN, THE PROVED

UNDEVELOPED RESERVES ARE RELATED TO THE REMAINDER OF THE INITIAL DEVELOPMENT OF

THE OFFSHORE KASHAGAN FIELD WHICH IS INCLUDED IN THE NORTH CASPIAN PRODUCTION

SHARING AGREEMENT AND THE TENGIZCHEVROIL JOINT VENTURE WHICH INCLUDES A

PRODUCTION LICENSE IN THE TENGIZ – KOROLEV FIELD COMPLEX. THE TENGIZCHEVROIL

JOINT VENTURE IS PRODUCING, AND PROVED UNDEVELOPED RESERVES WILL CONTINUE TO

MOVE TO PROVED DEVELOPED AS APPROVED DEVELOPMENT PHASES PROGRESS. IN THE

NETHERLANDS, THE GRONINGEN GAS FIELD HAS PROVED UNDEVELOPED RESERVES REPORTED

THAT ARE RELATED TO INSTALLATION OF FUTURE STAGES OF COMPRESSION. THESE

RESERVES WILL MOVE TO PROVED DEVELOPED WHEN THE ADDITIONAL STAGES OF

COMPRESSION ARE INSTALLED TO MAINTAIN FIELD DELIVERY PRESSURE.

EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION LICENSES FOR BOTH ONSHORE AND OFFSHORE AREAS ARE

ISSUED FOR A PERIOD AS EXPLICITLY DEFINED IN THE LICENSE. THE TERM IS BASED ON

THE PERIOD OF TIME NECESSARY TO PERFORM THE ACTIVITIES FOR WHICH THE LICENSE IS

ISSUED. LICENSE CONDITIONS ARE STIPULATED IN THE LICENSE AND ARE BASED ON THE

MINING LAW.

PRODUCTION RIGHTS GRANTED PRIOR TO JANUARY 1, 2003,

REMAIN SUBJECT TO THEIR EXISTING TERMS, AND DIFFER SLIGHTLY FOR ONSHORE AND

OFFSHORE AREAS. ONSHORE PRODUCTION LICENSES ISSUED PRIOR TO 1988 WERE

INDEFINITE; FROM 1988 THEY WERE ISSUED FOR A PERIOD AS EXPLICITLY DEFINED IN

THE LICENSE, RANGING FROM 35 TO 45 YEARS. OFFSHORE PRODUCTION LICENSES ISSUED

BEFORE 1976 WERE ISSUED FOR A FIXED PERIOD OF 40 YEARS; FROM 1976 THEY WERE AGAIN

ISSUED FOR A PERIOD AS EXPLICITLY DEFINED IN THE LICENSE, RANGING FROM 15 TO 40

YEARS.

NORWAY

LICENSES ISSUED PRIOR TO 1972 WERE FOR AN INITIAL

PERIOD OF SIX YEARS AND AN EXTENSION PERIOD OF 40 YEARS, WITH RELINQUISHMENT OF

AT LEAST ONE-FOURTH OF THE ORIGINAL AREA REQUIRED AT THE END OF THE SIXTH YEAR

AND ANOTHER ONE-FOURTH AT THE END OF THE NINTH YEAR. LICENSES ISSUED BETWEEN

1972 AND 1997 WERE FOR AN INITIAL PERIOD OF UP TO SIX YEARS (WITH EXTENSION OF

THE INITIAL PERIOD OF ONE YEAR AT A TIME UP TO TEN YEARS AFTER 1985), AND AN

EXTENSION PERIOD OF UP TO 30 YEARS, WITH RELINQUISHMENT OF AT LEAST ONE-HALF OF

THE ORIGINAL AREA REQUIRED AT THE END OF THE INITIAL PERIOD. LICENSES ISSUED

AFTER JULY 1, 1997, HAVE AN INITIAL PERIOD OF UP TO TEN YEARS AND A NORMAL

EXTENSION PERIOD OF UP TO 30 YEARS OR IN SPECIAL CASES OF UP TO 50 YEARS, AND

WITH RELINQUISHMENT OF AT LEAST ONE-HALF OF THE ORIGINAL AREA REQUIRED AT THE

END OF THE INITIAL PERIOD.

UNITED KINGDOM

ACREAGE TERMS ARE FIXED BY THE GOVERNMENT AND ARE

PERIODICALLY CHANGED. FOR EXAMPLE, MANY OF THE EARLY LICENSES ISSUED UNDER THE

FIRST FOUR LICENSING ROUNDS PROVIDED FOR AN INITIAL TERM OF SIX YEARS WITH

RELINQUISHMENT OF AT LEAST ONE-HALF OF THE ORIGINAL AREA AT THE END OF THE

INITIAL TERM, SUBJECT TO EXTENSION FOR A FURTHER 40 YEARS. AT THE END OF ANY

SUCH 40-YEAR TERM, LICENSES MAY CONTINUE IN PRODUCING AREAS UNTIL CESSATION OF

PRODUCTION; OR LICENSES MAY CONTINUE IN DEVELOPMENT AREAS FOR PERIODS AGREED ON

A CASE-BY-CASE BASIS UNTIL THEY BECOME PRODUCING AREAS; OR LICENSES TERMINATE

IN ALL OTHER AREAS. THE LICENSING REGIME WAS LAST UPDATED IN 2002, AND THE

MAJORITY OF LICENSES ISSUED HAVE AN INITIAL TERM OF FOUR YEARS WITH A SECOND

TERM EXTENSION OF FOUR YEARS AND A FINAL TERM OF 18 YEARS WITH A MANDATORY

RELINQUISHMENT OF 50 PERCENT OF THE ACREAGE AFTER THE INITIAL TERM AND OF ALL

ACREAGE THAT IS NOT COVERED BY A DEVELOPMENT PLAN AT THE END OF THE SECOND TERM.

AFRICA

ANGOLA

EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION ACTIVITIES ARE GOVERNED BY

PRODUCTION SHARING AGREEMENTS WITH AN INITIAL EXPLORATION TERM OF FOUR YEARS

AND AN OPTIONAL SECOND PHASE OF TWO TO THREE YEARS. THE PRODUCTION PERIOD IS

FOR 25 YEARS, AND AGREEMENTS GENERALLY PROVIDE FOR A NEGOTIATED EXTENSION.

CHAD

EXPLORATION PERMITS ARE ISSUED FOR A PERIOD OF FIVE

YEARS, AND ARE RENEWABLE FOR ONE OR TWO FURTHER FIVE-YEAR PERIODS. THE TERMS

AND CONDITIONS OF THE PERMITS, INCLUDING RELINQUISHMENT OBLIGATIONS, ARE

SPECIFIED IN A NEGOTIATED CONVENTION. THE PRODUCTION TERM IS FOR 30 YEARS AND

MAY BE EXTENDED AT THE DISCRETION OF THE GOVERNMENT.

EQUATORIAL GUINEA

EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION ACTIVITIES ARE GOVERNED BY

PRODUCTION SHARING CONTRACTS NEGOTIATED WITH THE STATE MINISTRY OF MINES,

INDUSTRY AND ENERGY. THE EXPLORATION PERIODS ARE FOR 10 TO 15 YEARS WITH LIMITED

RELINQUISHMENTS IN THE ABSENCE OF COMMERCIAL DISCOVERIES. THE PRODUCTION PERIOD

FOR CRUDE OIL IS 30 YEARS, WHILE THE PRODUCTION PERIOD FOR GAS IS 50 YEARS.

UNDER THE HYDROCARBONS LAW ENACTED IN 2006, THE EXPLORATION TERMS FOR NEW

PRODUCTION SHARING CONTRACTS ARE FOUR TO FIVE YEARS WITH A MAXIMUM OF TWO

ONE-YEAR EXTENSIONS, UNLESS THE MINISTRY AGREES OTHERWISE.

NIGERIA

EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION ACTIVITIES IN THE DEEPWATER

OFFSHORE AREAS ARE TYPICALLY GOVERNED BY PRODUCTION SHARING CONTRACTS (PSCS) WITH

THE NATIONAL OIL COMPANY, THE NIGERIAN NATIONAL PETROLEUM CORPORATION (NNPC).

NNPC HOLDS THE UNDERLYING OIL PROSPECTING LICENSE (OPL) AND ANY RESULTING OIL

MINING LEASE (OML). THE TERMS OF THE PSCS ARE GENERALLY 30 YEARS, INCLUDING A

TEN-YEAR EXPLORATION PERIOD (AN INITIAL EXPLORATION PHASE PLUS ONE OR TWO

OPTIONAL PERIODS) COVERED BY AN OPL. UPON COMMERCIAL DISCOVERY, AN OPL MAY BE

CONVERTED TO AN OML. PARTIAL RELINQUISHMENT IS REQUIRED UNDER THE PSC AT THE

END OF THE TEN-YEAR EXPLORATION PERIOD, AND OMLS HAVE A 20-YEAR PRODUCTION

PERIOD THAT MAY BE EXTENDED.

SOME EXPLORATION ACTIVITIES ARE CARRIED OUT IN

DEEPWATER BY JOINT VENTURES WITH LOCAL COMPANIES HOLDING INTERESTS IN AN OPL.

OPLS IN DEEPWATER OFFSHORE AREAS ARE VALID FOR TEN YEARS AND ARE NON-RENEWABLE,

WHILE IN ALL OTHER AREAS THE LICENSES ARE FOR FIVE YEARS AND ALSO ARE

NON-RENEWABLE. DEMONSTRATING A COMMERCIAL DISCOVERY IS THE BASIS FOR CONVERSION

OF AN OPL TO AN OML.

OMLS GRANTED PRIOR TO THE 1969 PETROLEUM ACT (I.E.,

UNDER THE MINERAL OILS ACT 1914, REPEALED BY THE 1969 PETROLEUM ACT) WERE FOR

30 YEARS ONSHORE AND 40 YEARS IN OFFSHORE AREAS AND HAVE BEEN RENEWED,

EFFECTIVE DECEMBER 1, 2008, FOR A FURTHER PERIOD OF 20 YEARS, WITH A FURTHER

RENEWAL OPTION OF 20 YEARS. OPERATIONS UNDER THESE PRE-1969 OMLS ARE CONDUCTED

UNDER A JOINT VENTURE AGREEMENT WITH NNPC RATHER THAN A PSC. IN 2000, A

MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING (MOU) WAS EXECUTED DEFINING COMMERCIAL TERMS

APPLICABLE TO EXISTING JOINT VENTURE OIL PRODUCTION. THE MOU MAY BE TERMINATED

ON ONE CALENDAR YEAR’S NOTICE.

OMLS GRANTED UNDER THE 1969 PETROLEUM ACT, WHICH

INCLUDE ALL DEEPWATER OMLS, HAVE A MAXIMUM TERM OF 20 YEARS WITHOUT DISTINCTION

FOR ONSHORE OR OFFSHORE LOCATION AND ARE RENEWABLE, UPON 12 MONTHS’ WRITTEN

NOTICE, FOR ANOTHER PERIOD OF 20 YEARS. OMLS NOT HELD BY NNPC ARE ALSO SUBJECT

TO A MANDATORY 50-PERCENT RELINQUISHMENT AFTER THE FIRST TEN YEARS OF THEIR

DURATION.

AZERBAIJAN

THE PRODUCTION SHARING AGREEMENT (PSA) FOR THE

DEVELOPMENT OF THE AZERI-CHIRAG-GUNASHLI FIELD IS ESTABLISHED FOR AN INITIAL

PERIOD OF 30 YEARS STARTING FROM THE PSA EXECUTION DATE IN 1994.

EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION ACTIVITIES IN INDONESIA ARE

GENERALLY GOVERNED BY COOPERATION CONTRACTS, USUALLY IN THE FORM OF A

PRODUCTION SHARING CONTRACT (PSC), NEGOTIATED WITH BPMIGAS, A GOVERNMENT AGENCY

ESTABLISHED IN 2002 TO MANAGE UPSTREAM OIL AND GAS ACTIVITIES. IN 2012, INDONESIA’S

CONSTITUTIONAL COURT RULED CERTAIN ARTICLES OF LAW RELATING TO BPMIGAS TO BE

UNCONSTITUTIONAL, BUT STATED THAT ALL EXISTING PSCS SIGNED WITH BPMIGAS SHOULD

REMAIN IN FORCE UNTIL THEIR EXPIRY, AND THE FUNCTIONS AND DUTIES PREVIOUSLY

PERFORMED BY BPMIGAS ARE TO BE CARRIED OUT BY THE RELEVANT MINISTRY OF THE

GOVERNMENT OF INDONESIA UNTIL THE PROMULGATION OF A NEW OIL AND GAS LAW. THE

CURRENT PSCS HAVE AN EXPLORATION PERIOD OF SIX YEARS, WHICH CAN BE EXTENDED UP

TO 10 YEARS, AND AN EXPLOITATION PERIOD OF 20 YEARS. PSCS GENERALLY REQUIRE THE

CONTRACTOR TO RELINQUISH 10 PERCENT TO 20 PERCENT OF THE CONTRACT AREA AFTER

THREE YEARS AND GENERALLY ALLOW THE CONTRACTOR TO RETAIN NO MORE THAN 50

PERCENT TO 80 PERCENT OF THE ORIGINAL CONTRACT AREA AFTER SIX YEARS, DEPENDING

ON THE ACREAGE AND TERMS.

IRAQ

PARTICIPATE IN THE DEVELOPMENT AND PRODUCTION ACTIVITIES OF THE WEST QURNA

PHASE I OIL AND GAS FIELD EFFECTIVE MARCH 1, 2010. THE TERM OF THE

OFFSHORE EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION ACTIVITIES ARE

GOVERNED BY A PRODUCTION SHARING AGREEMENT NEGOTIATED WITH THE REPUBLIC OF

KAZAKHSTAN. THE EXPLORATION PERIOD IS SIX YEARS FOLLOWED BY SEPARATE APPRAISAL

PRODUCTION SHARING CONTRACTS (PSCS) NEGOTIATED WITH THE NATIONAL OIL COMPANY.

THE MORE RECENT PSCS GOVERNING EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION ACTIVITIES HAVE AN

OVERALL TERM OF 24 TO 38 YEARS, DEPENDING ON WATER DEPTH, WITH POSSIBLE

EXTENSIONS TO THE EXPLORATION AND/OR DEVELOPMENT PERIODS. THE EXPLORATION

PERIOD IS FIVE TO SEVEN YEARS WITH THE POSSIBILITY OF EXTENSIONS, AFTER WHICH

TIME AREAS WITH NO COMMERCIAL DISCOVERIES WILL BE DEEMED RELINQUISHED. THE

DEVELOPMENT PERIOD IS FROM FOUR TO SIX YEARS FROM COMMERCIAL DISCOVERY, WITH

THE POSSIBILITY OF EXTENSIONS UNDER SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES. AREAS FROM WHICH

COMMERCIAL PRODUCTION HAS NOT STARTED BY THE END OF THE DEVELOPMENT PERIOD WILL

BE DEEMED RELINQUISHED IF NO EXTENSION IS GRANTED. ALL EXTENSIONS ARE SUBJECT

TO THE NATIONAL OIL COMPANY’S PRIOR WRITTEN APPROVAL. THE TOTAL PRODUCTION

PERIOD IS 15 TO 25 YEARS FROM FIRST COMMERCIAL LIFTING, NOT TO EXCEED THE

OVERALL TERM OF THE CONTRACT.

IN 2008, THE COMPANY REACHED AGREEMENT WITH THE

NATIONAL OIL COMPANY FOR A NEW PSC, WHICH WAS SUBSEQUENTLY SIGNED IN 2009.

UNDER THE NEW PSC, FROM 2008 UNTIL MARCH 31, 2012, THE COMPANY WAS ENTITLED TO

UNDERTAKE NEW DEVELOPMENT AND PRODUCTION ACTIVITIES IN OIL FIELDS UNDER AN

EXISTING PSC, SUBJECT TO NEW MINIMUM WORK AND SPENDING COMMITMENTS, INCLUDING

AN ENHANCED OIL RECOVERY PROJECT IN ONE OF THE OIL FIELDS. WHEN THE EXISTING

PSC EXPIRED ON MARCH 31, 2012, THE PRODUCING FIELDS COVERED BY THE EXISTING PSC

AUTOMATICALLY BECAME PART OF THE NEW PSC, WHICH HAS A 25-YEAR DURATION FROM

APRIL 2008.

EXTEND THROUGH 2040 AND INCLUDE AN EXPLORATION PERIOD THROUGH 2020, DEVELOPMENT

PLAN SUBMISSION WITHIN EIGHT YEARS OF A DISCOVERY AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES

WITHIN FIVE YEARS OF PLAN APPROVAL.  THE BLACK SEA EXPLORATION LICENSE EXTENDS

FREQUENTLY USED TERMS

LISTED BELOW ARE DEFINITIONS OF SEVERAL OF

EXXONMOBIL’S KEY BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE MEASURES. THESE DEFINITIONS

ARE PROVIDED TO FACILITATE UNDERSTANDING OF THE TERMS AND THEIR CALCULATION.

CASH FLOW FROM OPERATIONS AND ASSET SALES

CASH FLOW

FROM OPERATIONS AND ASSET SALES IS THE SUM OF THE NET CASH PROVIDED BY

OPERATING ACTIVITIES AND PROCEEDS ASSOCIATED WITH SALES OF SUBSIDIARIES,

PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT, AND SALES AND RETURNS OF INVESTMENTS FROM THE

CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS. THIS CASH FLOW REFLECTS THE TOTAL SOURCES

OF CASH FROM BOTH OPERATING THE CORPORATION’S ASSETS AND FROM THE DIVESTING OF

ASSETS. THE CORPORATION EMPLOYS A LONG-STANDING AND REGULAR DISCIPLINED REVIEW

PROCESS TO ENSURE THAT ALL ASSETS ARE CONTRIBUTING TO THE CORPORATION’S

STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES. ASSETS ARE DIVESTED WHEN THEY ARE NO LONGER MEETING THESE

OBJECTIVES OR ARE WORTH CONSIDERABLY MORE TO OTHERS. BECAUSE OF THE REGULAR

NATURE OF THIS ACTIVITY, WE BELIEVE IT IS USEFUL FOR INVESTORS TO CONSIDER

PROCEEDS ASSOCIATED WITH ASSET SALES TOGETHER WITH CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING

ACTIVITIES WHEN EVALUATING CASH AVAILABLE FOR INVESTMENT IN THE BUSINESS AND

FINANCING ACTIVITIES, INCLUDING SHAREHOLDER DISTRIBUTIONS.

RETURN ON AVERAGE CAPITAL EMPLOYED

RETURN ON

AVERAGE CAPITAL EMPLOYED (ROCE) IS A PERFORMANCE MEASURE RATIO. FROM THE

PERSPECTIVE OF THE BUSINESS SEGMENTS, ROCE IS ANNUAL BUSINESS SEGMENT EARNINGS

DIVIDED BY AVERAGE BUSINESS SEGMENT CAPITAL EMPLOYED (AVERAGE OF BEGINNING AND

END-OF-YEAR AMOUNTS). THESE SEGMENT EARNINGS INCLUDE EXXONMOBIL’S SHARE OF

SEGMENT EARNINGS OF EQUITY COMPANIES, CONSISTENT WITH OUR CAPITAL EMPLOYED

DEFINITION, AND EXCLUDE THE COST OF FINANCING. THE CORPORATION’S TOTAL ROCE IS

NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO EXXONMOBIL EXCLUDING THE AFTER-TAX COST OF

FINANCING, DIVIDED BY TOTAL CORPORATE AVERAGE CAPITAL EMPLOYED. THE CORPORATION

HAS CONSISTENTLY APPLIED ITS ROCE DEFINITION FOR MANY YEARS AND VIEWS IT AS THE

BEST MEASURE OF HISTORICAL CAPITAL PRODUCTIVITY IN OUR CAPITAL-INTENSIVE,

LONG-TERM INDUSTRY, BOTH TO EVALUATE MANAGEMENT’S PERFORMANCE AND TO

DEMONSTRATE TO SHAREHOLDERS THAT CAPITAL HAS BEEN USED WISELY OVER THE LONG

TERM. ADDITIONAL MEASURES, WHICH ARE MORE CASH FLOW BASED, ARE USED TO MAKE

INVESTMENT DECISIONS.

OVERVIEW

THE

FOLLOWING DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF EXXONMOBIL’S FINANCIAL RESULTS, AS WELL AS

THE ACCOMPANYING FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND RELATED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS TO WHICH THEY REFER, ARE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE

MANAGEMENT OF EXXON MOBIL CORPORATION. THE CORPORATION’S ACCOUNTING AND

FINANCIAL REPORTING FAIRLY REFLECT ITS STRAIGHTFORWARD BUSINESS MODEL INVOLVING

THE EXTRACTING, MANUFACTURING AND MARKETING OF HYDROCARBONS AND

HYDROCARBON-BASED PRODUCTS. THE CORPORATION’S BUSINESS MODEL INVOLVES THE

PRODUCTION (OR PURCHASE), MANUFACTURE AND SALE OF PHYSICAL PRODUCTS, AND ALL

COMMERCIAL ACTIVITIES ARE DIRECTLY IN SUPPORT OF THE UNDERLYING PHYSICAL

MOVEMENT OF GOODS.

EXXONMOBIL, WITH ITS RESOURCE BASE, FINANCIAL STRENGTH, DISCIPLINED

INVESTMENT APPROACH AND TECHNOLOGY PORTFOLIO, IS WELL-POSITIONED TO PARTICIPATE

IN SUBSTANTIAL INVESTMENTS TO DEVELOP NEW ENERGY SUPPLIES. WHILE COMMODITY

PRICES ARE VOLATILE ON A SHORT-TERM BASIS AND DEPEND ON SUPPLY AND DEMAND,

EXXONMOBIL’S INVESTMENT DECISIONS ARE BASED ON OUR LONG-TERM BUSINESS OUTLOOK,

USING A DISCIPLINED APPROACH IN SELECTING AND PURSUING THE MOST ATTRACTIVE

INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES. THE CORPORATE PLAN IS A FUNDAMENTAL ANNUAL MANAGEMENT

PROCESS THAT IS THE BASIS FOR SETTING NEAR-TERM OPERATING AND CAPITAL

OBJECTIVES IN ADDITION TO PROVIDING THE LONGER-TERM ECONOMIC ASSUMPTIONS USED

FOR INVESTMENT EVALUATION PURPOSES. VOLUMES ARE BASED ON INDIVIDUAL FIELD

PRODUCTION PROFILES, WHICH ARE ALSO UPDATED ANNUALLY. PRICE RANGES FOR CRUDE

OIL, NATURAL GAS, REFINED PRODUCTS, AND CHEMICAL PRODUCTS ARE BASED ON

CORPORATE PLAN ASSUMPTIONS DEVELOPED ANNUALLY BY MAJOR REGION AND ARE UTILIZED

FOR INVESTMENT EVALUATION PURPOSES. POTENTIAL INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES ARE

TESTED OVER A WIDE RANGE OF ECONOMIC SCENARIOS TO ESTABLISH THE RESILIENCY OF

EACH OPPORTUNITY. ONCE INVESTMENTS ARE MADE, A REAPPRAISAL PROCESS IS COMPLETED

TO ENSURE RELEVANT LESSONS ARE LEARNED AND IMPROVEMENTS ARE INCORPORATED INTO

FUTURE PROJECTS.

BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT AND RISK ASSESSMENT

LONG-TERM BUSINESS OUTLOOK

BY 2040, THE

WORLD’S POPULATION IS PROJECTED TO GROW TO APPROXIMATELY 8.8 BILLION

PEOPLE, OR CLOSE TO 2 BILLION MORE THAN IN 2010. COINCIDENT WITH THIS

POPULATION INCREASE, THE CORPORATION EXPECTS WORLDWIDE ECONOMIC GROWTH TO

AVERAGE CLOSE TO 3 PERCENT PER YEAR. AS ECONOMIES AND POPULATIONS GROW,

AND AS LIVING STANDARDS IMPROVE FOR BILLIONS OF PEOPLE, THE NEED FOR ENERGY

WILL CONTINUE TO RISE.  EVEN WITH SIGNIFICANT EFFICIENCY GAINS, GLOBAL ENERGY

DEMAND IS PROJECTED TO RISE BY ABOUT 35 PERCENT FROM 2010 TO 2040. THIS DEMAND

INCREASE IS EXPECTED TO BE CONCENTRATED IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES (I.E., THOSE

THAT ARE NOT MEMBER NATIONS OF THE ORGANISATION FOR ECONOMIC CO-OPERATION AND

DEVELOPMENT).

AS EXPANDING PROSPERITY DRIVES GLOBAL ENERGY DEMAND HIGHER, INCREASING

USE OF ENERGY-EFFICIENT AND LOWER-EMISSION FUELS, TECHNOLOGIES AND PRACTICES WILL

CONTINUE TO HELP SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE ENERGY CONSUMPTION AND EMISSIONS PER UNIT

OF ECONOMIC OUTPUT OVER TIME. SUBSTANTIAL EFFICIENCY GAINS ARE LIKELY IN ALL

KEY ASPECTS OF THE WORLD’S ECONOMY THROUGH 2040, AFFECTING ENERGY REQUIREMENTS

FOR TRANSPORTATION, POWER GENERATION, INDUSTRIAL APPLICATIONS, AND RESIDENTIAL

AND COMMERCIAL NEEDS.

ENERGY FOR TRANSPORTATION – INCLUDING CARS, TRUCKS, SHIPS, TRAINS AND

AIRPLANES – IS EXPECTED TO INCREASE BY ABOUT 40 PERCENT FROM 2010 TO 2040.

THE GLOBAL GROWTH IN TRANSPORTATION DEMAND IS LIKELY TO ACCOUNT FOR

APPROXIMATELY 70 PERCENT OF THE GROWTH IN LIQUID FUELS DEMAND OVER THIS

PERIOD. NEARLY ALL THE WORLD’S TRANSPORTATION FLEETS WILL CONTINUE TO RUN ON

LIQUID FUELS BECAUSE THEY ARE ABUNDANT, WIDELY AVAILABLE, EASY TO TRANSPORT,

AND PROVIDE A LARGE QUANTITY OF ENERGY IN SMALL VOLUMES.

DEMAND FOR ELECTRICITY AROUND THE WORLD IS LIKELY TO INCREASE

APPROXIMATELY 90 PERCENT BY 2040, LED BY GROWTH IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES.

CONSISTENT WITH THIS PROJECTION, POWER GENERATION IS EXPECTED TO REMAIN THE

LARGEST AND FASTEST-GROWING MAJOR SEGMENT OF GLOBAL ENERGY DEMAND. MEETING THE

EXPECTED GROWTH IN POWER DEMAND WILL REQUIRE A DIVERSE SET OF ENERGY SOURCES. NATURAL

GAS DEMAND IS LIKELY TO GROW MOST SIGNIFICANTLY AND BECOME THE LEADING SOURCE

OF GENERATED ELECTRICITY BY 2040, REFLECTING THE EFFICIENCY OF GAS-FIRED POWER

PLANTS.  TODAY, COAL HAS THE LARGEST FUEL SHARE IN THE POWER SECTOR, BUT ITS

SHARE IS LIKELY TO DECLINE SIGNIFICANTLY BY 2040 AS POLICIES ARE GRADUALLY

ADOPTED TO REDUCE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS INCLUDING THOSE RELATED TO LOCAL AIR

QUALITY AND GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS.  NUCLEAR POWER AND RENEWABLES, LED BY HYDROPOWER

AND WIND, ARE ALSO EXPECTED TO GROW SIGNIFICANTLY OVER THE PERIOD.

41

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL

CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

LIQUID FUELS PROVIDE THE LARGEST SHARE OF GLOBAL ENERGY

SUPPLIES TODAY DUE TO THEIR BROAD-BASED AVAILABILITY, AFFORDABILITY AND EASE OF

TRANSPORTATION, DISTRIBUTION AND STORAGE TO MEET CONSUMER NEEDS. BY 2040,

GLOBAL DEMAND FOR LIQUID FUELS IS EXPECTED TO GROW TO APPROXIMATELY 112 MILLION

BARRELS OF OIL‐EQUIVALENT PER DAY, AN INCREASE OF ABOUT 25 PERCENT

FROM 2010. THIS DEMAND WILL BE MET BY A WIDE VARIETY OF SOURCES. GLOBALLY, CONVENTIONAL

CRUDE PRODUCTION WILL LIKELY DECLINE SLIGHTLY THROUGH 2040. HOWEVER, THIS

DECLINE IS EXPECTED TO BE MORE THAN OFFSET BY RISING PRODUCTION FROM A WIDE

VARIETY OF EMERGING SUPPLY SOURCES – INCLUDING TIGHT OIL, DEEPWATER, OIL SANDS,

NATURAL GAS LIQUIDS AND BIOFUELS.  THE WORLD’S RESOURCE BASE IS SUFFICIENT TO

MEET PROJECTED DEMAND THROUGH 2040 AS TECHNOLOGY ADVANCES CONTINUE TO EXPAND

THE AVAILABILITY OF ECONOMIC SUPPLY OPTIONS. HOWEVER, ACCESS TO RESOURCES AND

TIMELY INVESTMENTS WILL REMAIN CRITICAL TO MEETING GLOBAL NEEDS WITH RELIABLE,

AFFORDABLE SUPPLIES.

NATURAL GAS IS A VERSATILE FUEL, SUITABLE FOR A WIDE VARIETY OF

APPLICATIONS, AND IS EXPECTED TO BE THE FASTEST GROWING MAJOR FUEL SOURCE

THROUGH 2040.  GLOBAL DEMAND IS EXPECTED TO RISE ABOUT 65 PERCENT FROM

2010 TO 2040, WITH DEMAND LIKELY TO INCREASE IN ALL MAJOR REGIONS OF THE WORLD.

HELPING MEET THESE NEEDS WILL BE SIGNIFICANT GROWTH IN SUPPLIES OF

UNCONVENTIONAL GAS – THE NATURAL GAS FOUND IN SHALE AND OTHER ROCK FORMATIONS

THAT WAS ONCE CONSIDERED UNECONOMIC TO PRODUCE.  ABOUT 65 PERCENT OF THE

GROWTH IN NATURAL GAS SUPPLIES IS EXPECTED TO BE FROM UNCONVENTIONAL SOURCES,

WHICH WILL ACCOUNT FOR ABOUT ONE-THIRD OF GLOBAL GAS SUPPLIES BY 2040.  GROWING

NATURAL GAS DEMAND WILL ALSO STIMULATE SIGNIFICANT GROWTH IN THE WORLDWIDE

LIQUEFIED NATURAL GAS (LNG) MARKET, WHICH IS EXPECTED TO REACH ABOUT 15 PERCENT

OF GLOBAL GAS DEMAND BY 2040.

THE WORLD’S ENERGY MIX IS HIGHLY DIVERSE AND WILL REMAIN SO THROUGH

2040. OIL IS EXPECTED TO REMAIN THE LARGEST SOURCE OF ENERGY WITH ITS SHARE

REMAINING CLOSE TO ONE-THIRD IN 2040.  COAL IS CURRENTLY THE SECOND LARGEST

SOURCE OF ENERGY, BUT IT IS LIKELY TO LOSE THAT POSITION TO NATURAL GAS BY

APPROXIMATELY 2025.  THE SHARE OF NATURAL GAS IS EXPECTED TO EXCEED 25 PERCENT

BY 2040, WHILE THE SHARE OF COAL FALLS TO LESS THAN 20 PERCENT. NUCLEAR

POWER IS PROJECTED TO GROW SIGNIFICANTLY, ALBEIT AT A SLOWER PACE THAN

OTHERWISE EXPECTED IN THE AFTERMATH OF THE FUKUSHIMA INCIDENT IN JAPAN

FOLLOWING THE EARTHQUAKE AND TSUNAMI IN MARCH 2011.  TOTAL RENEWABLE ENERGY IS

LIKELY TO REACH CLOSE TO 15 PERCENT OF TOTAL ENERGY BY 2040, WITH BIOMASS,

HYDRO AND GEOTHERMAL CONTRIBUTING A COMBINED SHARE OF ABOUT 11 PERCENT.

TOTAL ENERGY SUPPLIED FROM WIND, SOLAR AND BIOFUELS IS EXPECTED TO INCREASE

CLOSE TO 450 PERCENT FROM 2010 TO 2040, REACHING A COMBINED SHARE OF ABOUT

4 PERCENT OF WORLD ENERGY.

THE CORPORATION ANTICIPATES THAT THE WORLD’S AVAILABLE OIL AND GAS

RESOURCE BASE WILL GROW NOT ONLY FROM NEW DISCOVERIES, BUT ALSO FROM RESERVE

INCREASES IN PREVIOUSLY DISCOVERED FIELDS.  TECHNOLOGY WILL UNDERPIN THESE

INCREASES. THE COST TO DEVELOP AND SUPPLY THESE RESOURCES WILL BE SIGNIFICANT.

ACCORDING TO THE INTERNATIONAL ENERGY AGENCY, THE INVESTMENT REQUIRED TO MEET

TOTAL OIL AND GAS ENERGY NEEDS WORLDWIDE OVER THE PERIOD 2012‐2035 WILL

BE CLOSE TO $19 TRILLION (MEASURED IN 2011 DOLLARS) OR CLOSE TO $800 BILLION

PER YEAR ON AVERAGE.

INTERNATIONAL ACCORDS AND UNDERLYING REGIONAL AND NATIONAL REGULATIONS COVERING

GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS ARE EVOLVING WITH UNCERTAIN TIMING AND OUTCOME, MAKING

IT DIFFICULT TO PREDICT THEIR BUSINESS IMPACT.  EXXONMOBIL INCLUDES ESTIMATES

OF POTENTIAL COSTS RELATED TO POSSIBLE PUBLIC POLICIES COVERING ENERGY-RELATED

GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS IN ITS LONG-TERM OUTLOOK FOR ENERGY, WHICH IS USED FOR

ASSESSING THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT AND IN ITS INVESTMENT EVALUATIONS.

THE INFORMATION PROVIDED IN THE LONG-TERM BUSINESS OUTLOOK INCLUDES

EXXONMOBIL’S INTERNAL ESTIMATES AND FORECASTS BASED UPON INTERNAL DATA AND

ANALYSES AS WELL AS PUBLICLY AVAILABLE INFORMATION FROM EXTERNAL SOURCES

INCLUDING THE INTERNATIONAL ENERGY AGENCY.

UPSTREAM

EXXONMOBIL

CONTINUES TO MAINTAIN A DIVERSE PORTFOLIO OF EXPLORATION AND DEVELOPMENT

OPPORTUNITIES, WHICH ENABLES THE CORPORATION TO BE SELECTIVE, MAXIMIZING

SHAREHOLDER VALUE AND MITIGATING POLITICAL AND TECHNICAL RISKS. EXXONMOBIL’S

FUNDAMENTAL UPSTREAM BUSINESS STRATEGIES GUIDE OUR GLOBAL EXPLORATION,

DEVELOPMENT, PRODUCTION, AND GAS AND POWER MARKETING ACTIVITIES. THESE

STRATEGIES INCLUDE IDENTIFYING AND SELECTIVELY CAPTURING THE HIGHEST QUALITY

OPPORTUNITIES, EXERCISING A DISCIPLINED APPROACH TO INVESTING AND COST

MANAGEMENT, DEVELOPING AND APPLYING HIGH-IMPACT TECHNOLOGIES, MAXIMIZING THE

PROFITABILITY OF EXISTING OIL AND GAS PRODUCTION, AND CAPITALIZING ON GROWING

NATURAL GAS AND POWER MARKETS.   THESE STRATEGIES ARE UNDERPINNED BY A

RELENTLESS FOCUS ON OPERATIONAL EXCELLENCE, COMMITMENT TO INNOVATIVE

TECHNOLOGIES, DEVELOPMENT OF OUR EMPLOYEES, AND INVESTMENT IN THE COMMUNITIES

WITHIN WHICH WE OPERATE.

AS FUTURE DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS AND DRILLING ACTIVITIES BRING NEW

PRODUCTION ONLINE, THE CORPORATION EXPECTS A SHIFT IN THE GEOGRAPHIC MIX OF ITS

PRODUCTION VOLUMES BETWEEN NOW AND 2018. OIL EQUIVALENT PRODUCTION FROM NORTH

AMERICA IS EXPECTED TO INCREASE OVER THE NEXT FIVE YEARS BASED ON CURRENT

CAPITAL ACTIVITY PLANS. CURRENTLY, THIS GROWTH AREA ACCOUNTS FOR 32 PERCENT

OF THE CORPORATION’S PRODUCTION. BY 2018, IT IS EXPECTED TO GENERATE ABOUT 35 PERCENT

OF TOTAL VOLUMES. THE REMAINDER OF THE CORPORATION’S PRODUCTION IS EXPECTED TO

INCLUDE CONTRIBUTIONS FROM BOTH ESTABLISHED OPERATIONS AND NEW PROJECTS AROUND

THE GLOBE.

IN ADDITION TO AN EVOLVING GEOGRAPHIC MIX, WE EXPECT THERE WILL ALSO BE

CONTINUED CHANGE IN THE TYPE OF OPPORTUNITIES FROM WHICH VOLUMES ARE PRODUCED.

PRODUCTION FROM DIVERSE RESOURCE TYPES UTILIZING SPECIALIZED TECHNOLOGIES SUCH

AS ARCTIC TECHNOLOGY, DEEPWATER DRILLING AND PRODUCTION SYSTEMS, HEAVY OIL AND

OIL SANDS RECOVERY PROCESSES, UNCONVENTIONAL GAS AND OIL PRODUCTION AND

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL

CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

LNG IS EXPECTED TO GROW FROM ABOUT 45 PERCENT TO

AROUND 55 PERCENT OF THE CORPORATION’S OUTPUT BETWEEN NOW AND 2018. WE DO

NOT ANTICIPATE THAT THE EXPECTED CHANGE IN THE GEOGRAPHIC MIX OF PRODUCTION

VOLUMES, AND IN THE TYPES OF OPPORTUNITIES FROM WHICH VOLUMES WILL BE PRODUCED,

WILL HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE NATURE AND THE EXTENT OF THE RISKS DISCLOSED

IN ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS, OR RESULT IN A MATERIAL CHANGE IN OUR LEVEL OF UNIT

OPERATING EXPENSES. THE CORPORATION’S OVERALL VOLUME CAPACITY OUTLOOK, BASED ON

PROJECTS COMING ONSTREAM AS ANTICIPATED, IS FOR PRODUCTION CAPACITY TO GROW

OVER THE PERIOD 2014‐2018. HOWEVER, ACTUAL VOLUMES WILL VARY FROM YEAR TO

YEAR DUE TO THE TIMING OF INDIVIDUAL PROJECT START-UPS AND OTHER CAPITAL

ACTIVITIES, OPERATIONAL OUTAGES, RESERVOIR PERFORMANCE, PERFORMANCE OF ENHANCED

OIL RECOVERY PROJECTS, REGULATORY CHANGES, ASSET SALES, WEATHER EVENTS, PRICE

EFFECTS UNDER PRODUCTION SHARING CONTRACTS AND OTHER FACTORS DESCRIBED IN ITEM

1A. RISK FACTORS. ENHANCED OIL RECOVERY PROJECTS EXTRACT HYDROCARBONS FROM

RESERVOIRS IN EXCESS OF THAT WHICH MAY BE PRODUCED THROUGH PRIMARY RECOVERY,

I.E., THROUGH PRESSURE DEPLETION OR NATURAL AQUIFER SUPPORT. THEY INCLUDE THE

INJECTION OF WATER, GASES OR CHEMICALS INTO A RESERVOIR TO PRODUCE HYDROCARBONS

OTHERWISE UNOBTAINABLE.

DOWNSTREAM

EXXONMOBIL’S

DOWNSTREAM IS A LARGE, DIVERSIFIED BUSINESS WITH REFINING, LOGISTICS, AND

MARKETING COMPLEXES AROUND THE WORLD. THE CORPORATION HAS A PRESENCE IN MATURE

MARKETS IN NORTH AMERICA AND EUROPE, AS WELL AS IN THE GROWING ASIA PACIFIC

REGION. EXXONMOBIL’S FUNDAMENTAL DOWNSTREAM BUSINESS STRATEGIES POSITION THE

COMPANY TO DELIVER LONG-TERM GROWTH IN SHAREHOLDER VALUE THAT IS SUPERIOR TO

COMPETITION ACROSS A RANGE OF MARKET CONDITIONS. THESE STRATEGIES INCLUDE

MAINTAINING BEST‐IN‐CLASS OPERATIONS IN ALL ASPECTS OF THE

BUSINESS, MAXIMIZING VALUE FROM LEADING-EDGE TECHNOLOGIES, CAPITALIZING ON

INTEGRATION ACROSS EXXONMOBIL BUSINESSES, SELECTIVELY INVESTING FOR RESILIENT,

ADVANTAGED RETURNS, LEADING THE INDUSTRY IN EFFICIENCY AND EFFECTIVENESS, AND

PROVIDING QUALITY, VALUED PRODUCTS AND SERVICES TO CUSTOMERS.

EXXONMOBIL HAS AN OWNERSHIP INTEREST IN 31 REFINERIES, LOCATED IN 17

COUNTRIES, WITH DISTILLATION CAPACITY OF 5.3 MILLION BARRELS PER DAY AND

LUBRICANT BASESTOCK MANUFACTURING CAPACITY OF 126 THOUSAND BARRELS PER

DAY. EXXONMOBIL’S FUELS AND LUBES MARKETING BUSINESSES HAVE SIGNIFICANT GLOBAL

REACH, WITH MULTIPLE CHANNELS TO MARKET SERVING A DIVERSE CUSTOMER BASE.  OUR

PORTFOLIO OF WORLD-RENOWNED BRANDS INCLUDES

EXXON

AND

MOBIL 1.

THE DOWNSTREAM INDUSTRY ENVIRONMENT REMAINS CHALLENGING.  DEMAND

WEAKNESS AND OVERCAPACITY IN THE REFINING SECTOR WILL CONTINUE TO PUT PRESSURE

ON MARGINS.  IN THE NEAR TERM, WE SEE VARIABILITY IN REFINING MARGINS, WITH

SOME REGIONS SEEING STRONGER MARGINS AS REFINERIES RATIONALIZE. IN NORTH

AMERICA, LOWER RAW MATERIAL AND ENERGY COST DRIVEN BY INCREASING CRUDE OIL AND

NATURAL GAS PRODUCTION HAS STRENGTHENED REFINING MARGINS IN SEVERAL AREAS.

REFINING MARGINS ARE LARGELY DRIVEN BY DIFFERENCES IN COMMODITY PRICES

AND ARE A FUNCTION OF THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WHAT A REFINERY PAYS FOR ITS RAW

MATERIALS (PRIMARILY CRUDE OIL) AND THE MARKET PRICES FOR THE RANGE OF PRODUCTS

PRODUCED (PRIMARILY GASOLINE, HEATING OIL, DIESEL OIL, JET FUEL AND FUEL OIL).

CRUDE OIL AND MANY PRODUCTS ARE WIDELY TRADED WITH PUBLISHED PRICES, INCLUDING

THOSE QUOTED ON MULTIPLE EXCHANGES AROUND THE WORLD (E.G., NEW YORK MERCANTILE

EXCHANGE AND INTERCONTINENTAL EXCHANGE). PRICES FOR THESE COMMODITIES ARE

DETERMINED BY THE GLOBAL MARKETPLACE AND ARE INFLUENCED BY MANY FACTORS,

INCLUDING GLOBAL AND REGIONAL SUPPLY/DEMAND BALANCES, INVENTORY LEVELS, INDUSTRY

REFINERY OPERATIONS, IMPORT/EXPORT BALANCES, CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS, SEASONAL

DEMAND, WEATHER AND POLITICAL CLIMATE.

EXXONMOBIL’S LONG‐TERM OUTLOOK IS THAT INDUSTRY REFINING MARGINS

WILL REMAIN WEAK AS COMPETITION REMAINS INTENSE AND, IN THE NEAR TERM, NEW

CAPACITY ADDITIONS OUTPACE THE GROWTH IN GLOBAL DEMAND. ADDITIONALLY, AS

DESCRIBED IN MORE DETAIL IN ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS, PROPOSED CARBON POLICY AND

OTHER CLIMATE-RELATED REGULATIONS IN MANY COUNTRIES, AS WELL AS THE CONTINUED

GROWTH IN BIOFUELS MANDATES, COULD HAVE NEGATIVE IMPACTS ON THE REFINING

BUSINESS.  EXXONMOBIL’S INTEGRATION ACROSS THE VALUE CHAIN, FROM REFINING TO

MARKETING, ENHANCES OVERALL VALUE IN BOTH FUELS AND LUBRICANTS BUSINESSES.

IN THE RETAIL FUELS MARKETING BUSINESS, COMPETITION HAS CAUSED

INFLATION-ADJUSTED MARGINS TO DECLINE. IN 2013, EXXONMOBIL COMPLETED THE PREVIOUSLY

ANNOUNCED TRANSITION OF THE DIRECT SERVED (I.E., DEALER, COMPANY-OPERATED)

RETAIL NETWORK IN THE U.S. TO A MORE CAPITAL-EFFICIENT BRANDED DISTRIBUTOR

MODEL AND PROGRESSED THIS SAME MODEL IN PORTIONS OF EUROPE.  EXXONMOBIL IS

INCREASING INVESTMENT IN ITS FUELS BRANDS AND DEVELOPING MULTIPLE PROGRAMS THAT

WILL ENHANCE THE VALUE OF ITS CONSUMER RETAIL OFFER.  THE COMPANY’S LUBRICANTS

BUSINESS CONTINUES TO GROW, LEVERAGING WORLD-CLASS BRANDS AND INTEGRATION WITH

INDUSTRY-LEADING BASESTOCK REFINING CAPABILITY.  EXXONMOBIL REMAINS THE MARKET

LEADER IN THE HIGH‐VALUE SYNTHETIC LUBRICANTS SECTOR WHERE COMPETITION IS

INCREASING.

THE DOWNSTREAM PORTFOLIO IS CONTINUALLY EVALUATED DURING ALL PARTS OF

THE BUSINESS CYCLE, AND NUMEROUS ASSET DIVESTMENTS HAVE BEEN MADE OVER THE PAST

DECADE. WHEN INVESTING IN THE DOWNSTREAM, EXXONMOBIL REMAINS FOCUSED ON

SELECTIVE AND RESILIENT PROJECTS.  THESE INVESTMENTS CAPITALIZE ON THE

CORPORATION’S WORLD-CLASS SCALE AND INTEGRATION, INDUSTRY LEADING EFFICIENCY,

LEADING-EDGE TECHNOLOGY AND RESPECTED BRANDS, ENABLING EXXONMOBIL TO TAKE

ADVANTAGE OF ATTRACTIVE EMERGING GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES AROUND THE GLOBE.  IN 2013,

THE COMPANY COMPLETED A HYDROTREATER PROJECT AT THE SINGAPORE REFINERY TO

PRODUCE ULTRA‐LOW SULFUR DIESEL, AND A COGENERATION PROJECT AT THE AUGUSTA,

ITALY REFINERY TO IMPROVE ENERGY EFFICIENCY.  ADDITIONALLY, CONSTRUCTION OF A

LOWER SULFUR FUELS FACILITY AT THE JOINT SAUDI ARAMCO AND EXXONMOBIL SAMREF

REFINERY IN YANBU, SAUDI ARABIA IS NEARLY COMPLETE.  THE COMPANY IS ALSO

EXPANDING LUBRICANT BASESTOCK MANUFACTURING CAPACITY AT REFINERIES IN BAYTOWN,

CHEMICAL

WORLDWIDE

PETROCHEMICAL DEMAND GREW IN 2013, LED BY GROWING DEMAND FROM ASIA

MANUFACTURERS AND CONSUMERS.  NORTH AMERICA CONTINUED TO BENEFIT FROM ABUNDANT

SUPPLIES OF NATURAL GAS AND GAS LIQUIDS, PROVIDING BOTH LOW-COST FEEDSTOCK AND

ENERGY SAVINGS.  SPECIALTY PRODUCT MARGINS DECLINED REFLECTING SIGNIFICANT NEW

INDUSTRY CAPACITY FOLLOWING SEVERAL YEARS OF TIGHT SUPPLIES.

EXXONMOBIL SUSTAINED ITS COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE THROUGH CONTINUED

OPERATIONAL EXCELLENCE, INVESTMENT AND COST DISCIPLINE, A BALANCED PORTFOLIO OF

PRODUCTS, INTEGRATION WITH REFINING AND UPSTREAM OPERATIONS, ALL UNDERPINNED BY

PROPRIETARY TECHNOLOGY.

IN 2013 EXXONMOBIL STARTED UP THE SINGAPORE CHEMICAL EXPANSION PROJECT,

MORE THAN DOUBLING STEAM‐CRACKING CAPACITY AT THE SITE AND SIGNIFICANTLY

INCREASING PREMIUM AND SPECIALTY PRODUCTS CAPACITY.  SINGAPORE IS NOW

EXXONMOBIL’S LARGEST INTEGRATED PETROCHEMICAL COMPLEX.

STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS.

THE CORPORATION HAS ACCESS TO SIGNIFICANT CAPACITY OF LONG-TERM AND

SHORT-TERM LIQUIDITY.  INTERNALLY GENERATED FUNDS ARE EXPECTED TO COVER THE

MAJORITY OF FINANCIAL REQUIREMENTS, AND MAY BE SUPPLEMENTED BY LONG-TERM AND

SHORT-TERM DEBT, INCLUDING A REVOLVING COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAM.  THE

CORPORATION HAS COMMITTED LINES OF CREDIT OF $6.5 BILLION WHICH WERE UNUSED AS

OF DECEMBER 31, 2013.  CASH THAT MAY BE TEMPORARILY AVAILABLE AS SURPLUS TO THE

CORPORATION’S IMMEDIATE NEEDS IS CAREFULLY MANAGED THROUGH COUNTERPARTY QUALITY

AND INVESTMENT GUIDELINES TO ENSURE IT IS SECURE AND READILY AVAILABLE TO MEET

THE CORPORATION’S CASH REQUIREMENTS AND TO OPTIMIZE RETURNS.

TO SUPPORT CASH FLOWS IN FUTURE PERIODS THE CORPORATION WILL NEED TO

CONTINUALLY FIND AND DEVELOP NEW FIELDS, AND CONTINUE TO DEVELOP AND APPLY NEW

TECHNOLOGIES AND RECOVERY PROCESSES TO EXISTING FIELDS, IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN OR

INCREASE PRODUCTION. AFTER A PERIOD OF PRODUCTION AT PLATEAU RATES, IT IS THE

NATURE OF OIL AND GAS FIELDS EVENTUALLY TO PRODUCE AT DECLINING RATES FOR THE

REMAINDER OF THEIR ECONOMIC LIFE. AVERAGED OVER ALL THE CORPORATION’S EXISTING

OIL AND GAS FIELDS AND WITHOUT NEW PROJECTS, EXXONMOBIL’S PRODUCTION IS

EXPECTED TO DECLINE AT AN AVERAGE OF APPROXIMATELY 3 PERCENT PER YEAR OVER THE

NEXT FEW YEARS. DECLINE RATES CAN VARY WIDELY BY INDIVIDUAL FIELD DUE TO A

NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE TYPE OF RESERVOIR, FLUID

PROPERTIES, RECOVERY MECHANISMS, WORK ACTIVITY, AND AGE OF THE FIELD.

FURTHERMORE, THE CORPORATION’S NET INTEREST IN PRODUCTION FOR INDIVIDUAL FIELDS

CAN VARY WITH PRICE AND CONTRACTUAL TERMS.

THE CORPORATION HAS LONG BEEN SUCCESSFUL AT OFFSETTING THE EFFECTS OF

NATURAL FIELD DECLINE THROUGH DISCIPLINED INVESTMENTS IN QUALITY OPPORTUNITIES

AND PROJECT EXECUTION. OVER THE LAST DECADE, THIS HAS RESULTED IN NET ANNUAL

ADDITIONS TO PROVED RESERVES THAT HAVE EXCEEDED THE AMOUNT PRODUCED. PROJECTS

ARE IN PROGRESS OR PLANNED TO INCREASE PRODUCTION CAPACITY. HOWEVER, THESE

VOLUME INCREASES ARE SUBJECT TO A VARIETY OF RISKS INCLUDING PROJECT START-UP

TIMING, OPERATIONAL OUTAGES, RESERVOIR PERFORMANCE, CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS

PRICES, WEATHER EVENTS, AND REGULATORY CHANGES. THE CORPORATION’S CASH FLOWS

ARE ALSO HIGHLY DEPENDENT ON CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS PRICES. PLEASE REFER TO

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS FOR A MORE COMPLETE DISCUSSION OF RISKS.

THE CORPORATION’S FINANCIAL STRENGTH ENABLES IT TO MAKE LARGE,

LONG-TERM CAPITAL EXPENDITURES. CAPITAL AND EXPLORATION EXPENDITURES IN 2013

WERE $42.5 BILLION, REFLECTING THE CORPORATION’S CONTINUED ACTIVE INVESTMENT

PROGRAM. THE CORPORATION ANTICIPATES AN AVERAGE INVESTMENT PROFILE OF ABOUT $37

BILLION PER YEAR FOR THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS. ACTUAL SPENDING COULD VARY

DEPENDING ON THE PROGRESS OF INDIVIDUAL PROJECTS AND PROPERTY ACQUISITIONS.  THE

CORPORATION HAS A LARGE AND DIVERSE PORTFOLIO OF DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS AND

EXPLORATION OPPORTUNITIES, WHICH HELPS MITIGATE THE OVERALL POLITICAL AND

TECHNICAL RISKS OF THE CORPORATION’S UPSTREAM SEGMENT AND ASSOCIATED CASH FLOW.

FURTHER, DUE TO ITS FINANCIAL STRENGTH, DEBT CAPACITY AND DIVERSE PORTFOLIO OF

OPPORTUNITIES, THE RISK ASSOCIATED WITH FAILURE OR DELAY OF ANY SINGLE PROJECT

WOULD NOT HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE

48

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL

CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

CORPORATION’S

LIQUIDITY OR ABILITY TO GENERATE SUFFICIENT CASH FLOWS FOR OPERATIONS AND ITS

CASH FLOW FROM

FINANCING ACTIVITIES

2013

CASH USED IN

FINANCING ACTIVITIES WAS $15.5 BILLION IN 2013, $18.4 BILLION LOWER THAN 2012.

DIVIDEND PAYMENTS ON COMMON SHARES INCREASED TO $2.46 PER SHARE FROM $2.18 PER

SHARE AND TOTALED $10.9 BILLION, A PAY-OUT OF 33 PERCENT OF NET INCOME. TOTAL

DEBT INCREASED $11.1 BILLION TO $22.7 BILLION AT YEAR-END.

EXXONMOBIL SHARE OF EQUITY INCREASED $8.1 BILLION TO $174.0 BILLION.

THE ADDITION TO EQUITY FOR EARNINGS OF $32.6 BILLION WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY

REDUCTIONS FOR DISTRIBUTIONS TO EXXONMOBIL SHAREHOLDERS OF $10.9 BILLION OF

DIVIDENDS AND $15.0 BILLION OF PURCHASES OF SHARES OF EXXONMOBIL STOCK TO

REDUCE SHARES OUTSTANDING.

DURING 2013, EXXON MOBIL

CORPORATION PURCHASED 177 MILLION SHARES OF ITS COMMON STOCK FOR THE TREASURY

AT A GROSS COST OF $16.0 BILLION. THESE PURCHASES WERE TO REDUCE THE NUMBER OF

SHARES OUTSTANDING AND TO OFFSET SHARES ISSUED IN CONJUNCTION WITH COMPANY

BENEFIT PLANS AND PROGRAMS. SHARES OUTSTANDING WERE REDUCED BY 3.7 PERCENT FROM

4,502 MILLION TO 4,335 MILLION AT THE END OF 2013. PURCHASES WERE MADE IN BOTH

THE OPEN MARKET AND THROUGH NEGOTIATED TRANSACTIONS. PURCHASES MAY BE

INCREASED, DECREASED OR DISCONTINUED AT ANY TIME WITHOUT PRIOR NOTICE.

HIGHLY LIQUID MARKET OR UNDER LONG-TERM, UNCONDITIONAL SALES CONTRACTS WITH

SIMILAR PRICING TERMS. EXAMPLES INCLUDE LONG-TERM, NONCANCELABLE LNG AND

NATURAL GAS PURCHASE COMMITMENTS AND COMMITMENTS TO PURCHASE REFINERY PRODUCTS

AT MARKET PRICES. INCLUSION OF SUCH COMMITMENTS WOULD NOT BE MEANINGFUL IN

ASSESSING LIQUIDITY AND CASH FLOW, BECAUSE THESE PURCHASES WILL BE OFFSET IN

THE SAME PERIODS BY CASH RECEIVED FROM THE RELATED SALES TRANSACTIONS. THE

TABLE ALSO EXCLUDES UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS TOTALING $7.8 BILLION AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2013, BECAUSE THE CORPORATION IS UNABLE TO MAKE REASONABLY

RELIABLE ESTIMATES OF THE TIMING OF CASH SETTLEMENTS WITH THE RESPECTIVE TAXING

AUTHORITIES. FURTHER DETAILS ON THE UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS CAN BE FOUND IN

SECURE FINANCING FOR THE FACILITIES THAT WILL PROVIDE THE CONTRACTED GOODS OR

SERVICES. THE UNDISCOUNTED OBLIGATIONS OF $1,236 MILLION MAINLY PERTAIN TO

PIPELINE THROUGHPUT AGREEMENTS AND INCLUDE $457 MILLION OF OBLIGATIONS TO

EQUITY COMPANIES.

(7)   TAKE-OR-PAY OBLIGATIONS ARE

NONCANCELABLE, LONG-TERM COMMITMENTS FOR GOODS AND SERVICES OTHER THAN UPOS.

THE UNDISCOUNTED OBLIGATIONS OF $29,610 MILLION MAINLY PERTAIN TO PIPELINE, MANUFACTURING

SUPPLY AND TERMINALING AGREEMENTS.

(8)   FIRM COMMITMENTS RELATED TO

CAPITAL PROJECTS, SHOWN ON AN UNDISCOUNTED BASIS, TOTALED APPROXIMATELY $29.8

BILLION. THESE COMMITMENTS WERE PRIMARILY ASSOCIATED WITH UPSTREAM PROJECTS

OUTSIDE THE U.S., OF WHICH $16.3 BILLION WAS ASSOCIATED WITH PROJECTS IN CANADA,

AUSTRALIA, AFRICA, UNITED ARAB EMIRATES AND MALAYSIA.  THE CORPORATION EXPECTS

TO FUND THE MAJORITY OF THESE PROJECTS WITH INTERNALLY GENERATED FUNDS THAT MAY BE SUPPLEMENTED BY

LONG-TERM AND SHORT-TERM DEBT, INCLUDING A REVOLVING COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAM.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL

CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

GUARANTEES

THE

CORPORATION AND CERTAIN OF ITS CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES WERE CONTINGENTLY

LIABLE AT DECEMBER 31, 2013, FOR GUARANTEES RELATING TO NOTES, LOANS AND

PERFORMANCE UNDER CONTRACTS (NOTE 16). WHERE GUARANTEES FOR ENVIRONMENTAL

REMEDIATION AND OTHER SIMILAR MATTERS DO NOT INCLUDE A STATED CAP, THE AMOUNTS

REFLECT MANAGEMENT’S ESTIMATE OF THE MAXIMUM POTENTIAL EXPOSURE. THESE GUARANTEES

ARE NOT REASONABLY LIKELY TO HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE CORPORATION’S

FINANCIAL CONDITION, CHANGES IN FINANCIAL CONDITION, REVENUES OR EXPENSES,

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, LIQUIDITY, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES OR CAPITAL RESOURCES.

FINANCIAL STRENGTH

ON

DECEMBER 31, 2013, THE CORPORATION’S UNUSED SHORT-TERM COMMITTED LINES OF CREDIT

TOTALED APPROXIMATELY $5.9 BILLION (NOTE 6) AND UNUSED LONG-TERM COMMITTED

LINES OF CREDIT TOTALED APPROXIMATELY $0.6 BILLION (NOTE 14).

MANAGEMENT

VIEWS THE CORPORATION’S FINANCIAL STRENGTH, AS EVIDENCED BY THE ABOVE FINANCIAL

RATIOS AND OTHER SIMILAR MEASURES, TO BE A COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE OF STRATEGIC

IMPORTANCE. THE CORPORATION’S SOUND FINANCIAL POSITION GIVES IT THE OPPORTUNITY

TO ACCESS THE WORLD’S CAPITAL MARKETS IN THE FULL RANGE OF MARKET CONDITIONS,

AND ENABLES THE CORPORATION TO TAKE ON LARGE, LONG-TERM CAPITAL COMMITMENTS IN

THE PURSUIT OF MAXIMIZING SHAREHOLDER VALUE.

LITIGATION AND OTHER CONTINGENCIES

AS DISCUSSED

IN NOTE 16, A VARIETY OF CLAIMS HAVE BEEN MADE AGAINST EXXONMOBIL AND CERTAIN

OF ITS CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES IN A NUMBER OF PENDING LAWSUITS. BASED ON A

CONSIDERATION OF ALL RELEVANT FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES, THE CORPORATION DOES NOT

BELIEVE THE ULTIMATE OUTCOME OF ANY CURRENTLY PENDING LAWSUIT AGAINST

EXXONMOBIL WILL HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT UPON THE CORPORATION’S

OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, OR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS TAKEN AS A WHOLE.

THERE ARE NO EVENTS OR UNCERTAINTIES BEYOND THOSE ALREADY INCLUDED IN REPORTED

FINANCIAL INFORMATION THAT WOULD INDICATE A MATERIAL CHANGE IN FUTURE OPERATING

RESULTS OR FINANCIAL CONDITION. REFER TO NOTE 16 FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON

CAPITAL AND

EXPLORATION EXPENDITURES IN 2013 WERE $42.5 BILLION, INCLUDING $4.3 BILLION FOR

ACQUISITIONS, AS THE CORPORATION CONTINUED TO PURSUE OPPORTUNITIES TO FIND AND

PRODUCE NEW SUPPLIES OF OIL AND NATURAL GAS TO MEET GLOBAL DEMAND FOR ENERGY.

THE CORPORATION ANTICIPATES AN AVERAGE INVESTMENT PROFILE OF ABOUT $37 BILLION

PER YEAR FOR THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS. ACTUAL SPENDING COULD VARY DEPENDING ON

THE PROGRESS OF INDIVIDUAL PROJECTS AND PROPERTY ACQUISITIONS.

UPSTREAM SPENDING OF $38.2 BILLION IN 2013 WAS UP 6 PERCENT FROM 2012.

PROPERTY ACQUISITION COSTS IN THE UPSTREAM IN 2013 OF $4.2 BILLION WERE $1.2

BILLION HIGHER THAN IN 2012.  INVESTMENTS IN 2013 INCLUDED PROJECTS IN THE U.S.

GULF OF MEXICO AND ALASKA, EXPLORATION IN RUSSIA AND CONTINUED PROGRESS ON

WORLD-CLASS PROJECTS IN CANADA, AUSTRALIA AND PAPUA NEW GUINEA.  THE MAJORITY

OF EXPENDITURES ARE ON DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS, WHICH TYPICALLY TAKE TWO TO FOUR

YEARS FROM THE TIME OF RECORDING PROVED UNDEVELOPED RESERVES TO THE START OF

PRODUCTION FROM THOSE RESERVES. THE PERCENTAGE OF PROVED DEVELOPED RESERVES WAS

66 PERCENT OF TOTAL PROVED RESERVES AT YEAR-END 2013, AND HAS BEEN OVER 60

PERCENT FOR THE LAST TEN YEARS, INDICATING THAT PROVED RESERVES ARE CONSISTENTLY

MOVED FROM UNDEVELOPED TO DEVELOPED STATUS.

CAPITAL INVESTMENTS IN THE DOWNSTREAM TOTALED $2.4 BILLION IN 2013, AN

INCREASE OF $0.2 BILLION FROM 2012, MAINLY REFLECTING HIGHER REFINING MARGIN

IMPROVEMENT PROJECT SPENDING. THE CHEMICAL CAPITAL EXPENDITURES OF $1.8 BILLION

INCREASED $0.4 BILLION FROM 2012 WITH HIGHER INVESTMENTS IN THE U.S., SAUDI

ARABIA AND CHINA MORE THAN OFFSETTING REDUCED SPENDING ON THE COMPLETED

SINGAPORE CHEMICAL PLANT EXPANSION.

CURRENT AND DEFERRED, WAS $24.3 BILLION, $6.8 BILLION LOWER THAN 2012, WITH THE

IMPACT OF LOWER EARNINGS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE HIGHER EFFECTIVE TAX RATE.

THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE WAS 48 PERCENT COMPARED TO 44 PERCENT IN THE PRIOR YEAR

DUE TO THE ABSENCE OF FAVORABLE TAX IMPACTS ON DIVESTMENTS.  SALES-BASED AND

ALL OTHER TAXES AND DUTIES OF $67.0 BILLION IN 2013 DECREASED $4.3 BILLION

REFLECTING THE 2012 JAPAN RESTRUCTURING.

2012

INCOME, SALES-BASED

AND ALL OTHER TAXES AND DUTIES TOTALED $102.3 BILLION IN 2012, A DECREASE OF

$5.8 BILLION OR 5 PERCENT FROM 2011. INCOME TAX EXPENSE, BOTH CURRENT AND

DEFERRED, WAS $31.0 BILLION, FLAT WITH 2011, WITH THE IMPACT OF HIGHER EARNINGS

OFFSET BY THE LOWER EFFECTIVE TAX RATE.  THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE WAS 44 PERCENT

COMPARED TO 46 PERCENT IN THE PRIOR YEAR DUE TO A LOWER EFFECTIVE TAX RATE ON

DIVESTMENTS.  SALES-BASED AND ALL OTHER TAXES AND DUTIES OF $71.3 BILLION IN

2012 DECREASED $5.8 BILLION REFLECTING THE JAPAN RESTRUCTURING.

THROUGHOUT

EXXONMOBIL’S BUSINESSES, NEW AND ONGOING MEASURES ARE TAKEN TO PREVENT AND

MINIMIZE THE IMPACT OF OUR OPERATIONS ON AIR, WATER AND GROUND. THESE

INCLUDE A SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT IN REFINING INFRASTRUCTURE AND TECHNOLOGY TO

MANUFACTURE CLEAN FUELS AS WELL AS PROJECTS TO MONITOR AND REDUCE NITROGEN

OXIDE, SULFUR OXIDE AND GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS AND EXPENDITURES FOR ASSET

RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS. USING DEFINITIONS AND GUIDELINES ESTABLISHED BY THE AMERICAN

PETROLEUM INSTITUTE, EXXONMOBIL’S 2013 WORLDWIDE ENVIRONMENTAL EXPENDITURES FOR

ALL SUCH PREVENTATIVE AND REMEDIATION STEPS, INCLUDING EXXONMOBIL’S SHARE OF

EQUITY COMPANY EXPENDITURES, WERE ABOUT $6.0 BILLION. THE TOTAL COST

FOR SUCH ACTIVITIES IS EXPECTED TO REMAIN IN THIS RANGE IN 2014 AND 2015 (WITH

CAPITAL EXPENDITURES APPROXIMATELY 45 PERCENT OF THE TOTAL).

ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES

THE

CORPORATION ACCRUES ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES WHEN IT IS PROBABLE THAT

OBLIGATIONS HAVE BEEN INCURRED AND THE AMOUNTS CAN BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED.

THIS POLICY APPLIES TO ASSETS OR BUSINESSES CURRENTLY OWNED OR PREVIOUSLY

DISPOSED. EXXONMOBIL HAS ACCRUED LIABILITIES FOR PROBABLE ENVIRONMENTAL

REMEDIATION OBLIGATIONS AT VARIOUS SITES, INCLUDING MULTIPARTY SITES WHERE THE

U.S. ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY HAS IDENTIFIED EXXONMOBIL AS ONE OF THE

POTENTIALLY RESPONSIBLE PARTIES. THE INVOLVEMENT OF OTHER FINANCIALLY

RESPONSIBLE COMPANIES AT THESE MULTIPARTY SITES COULD MITIGATE EXXONMOBIL’S

ACTUAL JOINT AND SEVERAL LIABILITY EXPOSURE. AT PRESENT, NO INDIVIDUAL SITE IS

EXPECTED TO HAVE LOSSES MATERIAL TO EXXONMOBIL’S OPERATIONS OR FINANCIAL

CONDITION. CONSOLIDATED COMPANY PROVISIONS MADE IN 2013 FOR ENVIRONMENTAL

LIABILITIES WERE $321 MILLION ($391 MILLION IN 2012) AND THE BALANCE

SHEET REFLECTS ACCUMULATED LIABILITIES OF $773 MILLION AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2013, AND $841 MILLION AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2012.

CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES.

CRUDE OIL,

NATURAL GAS, PETROLEUM PRODUCT AND CHEMICAL PRICES HAVE FLUCTUATED IN RESPONSE

TO CHANGING MARKET FORCES. THE IMPACTS OF THESE PRICE FLUCTUATIONS ON EARNINGS

FROM UPSTREAM, DOWNSTREAM AND CHEMICAL OPERATIONS HAVE VARIED. IN THE UPSTREAM,

A $1 PER BARREL CHANGE IN THE WEIGHTED-AVERAGE REALIZED PRICE OF OIL

WOULD HAVE APPROXIMATELY A $350 MILLION ANNUAL AFTER-TAX EFFECT ON UPSTREAM

CONSOLIDATED PLUS EQUITY COMPANY EARNINGS. SIMILARLY, A $0.10 PER KCF CHANGE IN

THE WORLDWIDE AVERAGE GAS REALIZATION WOULD HAVE APPROXIMATELY A $175 MILLION

ANNUAL AFTER-TAX EFFECT ON UPSTREAM CONSOLIDATED PLUS EQUITY COMPANY EARNINGS.

FOR ANY GIVEN PERIOD, THE EXTENT OF ACTUAL BENEFIT OR DETRIMENT WILL BE

DEPENDENT ON THE PRICE MOVEMENTS OF INDIVIDUAL TYPES OF CRUDE OIL, TAXES AND

OTHER GOVERNMENT TAKE IMPACTS, PRICE ADJUSTMENT LAGS IN LONG-TERM GAS

CONTRACTS, AND CRUDE AND GAS PRODUCTION VOLUMES. ACCORDINGLY, CHANGES IN

BENCHMARK PRICES FOR CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS ONLY PROVIDE BROAD INDICATORS OF

CHANGES IN THE EARNINGS EXPERIENCED IN ANY PARTICULAR PERIOD.

IN THE VERY COMPETITIVE DOWNSTREAM AND CHEMICAL ENVIRONMENTS, EARNINGS

ARE PRIMARILY DETERMINED BY MARGIN CAPTURE RATHER THAN ABSOLUTE PRICE LEVELS OF

PRODUCTS SOLD. REFINING MARGINS ARE A FUNCTION OF THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WHAT A

REFINER PAYS FOR ITS RAW MATERIALS (PRIMARILY CRUDE OIL) AND THE MARKET PRICES

FOR THE RANGE OF PRODUCTS PRODUCED. THESE PRICES IN TURN DEPEND ON GLOBAL AND

REGIONAL SUPPLY/DEMAND BALANCES, INVENTORY LEVELS, REFINERY OPERATIONS,

IMPORT/EXPORT BALANCES AND WEATHER.

54

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL

CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

THE GLOBAL ENERGY MARKETS CAN

GIVE RISE TO EXTENDED PERIODS IN WHICH MARKET CONDITIONS ARE ADVERSE TO ONE OR

MORE OF THE CORPORATION’S BUSINESSES. SUCH CONDITIONS, ALONG WITH THE

CAPITAL-INTENSIVE NATURE OF THE INDUSTRY AND VERY LONG LEAD TIMES ASSOCIATED

WITH MANY OF OUR PROJECTS, UNDERSCORE THE IMPORTANCE OF MAINTAINING A STRONG

FINANCIAL POSITION. MANAGEMENT VIEWS THE CORPORATION’S FINANCIAL STRENGTH AS A

COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE.

IN GENERAL, SEGMENT RESULTS ARE NOT DEPENDENT ON THE ABILITY TO SELL

AND/OR PURCHASE PRODUCTS TO/FROM OTHER SEGMENTS. INSTEAD, WHERE SUCH SALES TAKE

PLACE, THEY ARE THE RESULT OF EFFICIENCIES AND COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGES OF

INTEGRATED REFINERY/CHEMICAL COMPLEXES. ADDITIONALLY, INTERSEGMENT SALES ARE AT

MARKET-BASED PRICES. THE PRODUCTS BOUGHT AND SOLD BETWEEN SEGMENTS CAN ALSO BE

ACQUIRED IN WORLDWIDE MARKETS THAT HAVE SUBSTANTIAL LIQUIDITY, CAPACITY AND

TRANSPORTATION CAPABILITIES. ABOUT 35 PERCENT OF THE CORPORATION’S INTERSEGMENT

SALES ARE CRUDE OIL PRODUCED BY THE UPSTREAM AND SOLD TO THE DOWNSTREAM. OTHER

INTERSEGMENT SALES INCLUDE THOSE BETWEEN REFINERIES AND CHEMICAL PLANTS RELATED

TO RAW MATERIALS, FEEDSTOCKS AND FINISHED PRODUCTS.

ALTHOUGH PRICE LEVELS OF CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS MAY RISE OR FALL

SIGNIFICANTLY OVER THE SHORT TO MEDIUM TERM DUE TO POLITICAL EVENTS, OPEC

ACTIONS AND OTHER FACTORS, INDUSTRY ECONOMICS OVER THE LONG TERM WILL CONTINUE

TO BE DRIVEN BY MARKET SUPPLY AND DEMAND. ACCORDINGLY, THE CORPORATION TESTS

THE VIABILITY OF ALL OF ITS INVESTMENTS OVER A BROAD RANGE OF FUTURE PRICES.

THE CORPORATION’S ASSESSMENT IS THAT ITS OPERATIONS WILL CONTINUE TO BE SUCCESSFUL

IN A VARIETY OF MARKET CONDITIONS. THIS IS THE OUTCOME OF DISCIPLINED

INVESTMENT AND ASSET MANAGEMENT PROGRAMS.

THE CORPORATION HAS AN ACTIVE ASSET MANAGEMENT PROGRAM IN WHICH

UNDERPERFORMING ASSETS ARE EITHER IMPROVED TO ACCEPTABLE LEVELS OR CONSIDERED

FOR DIVESTMENT. THE ASSET MANAGEMENT PROGRAM INCLUDES A DISCIPLINED, REGULAR

REVIEW TO ENSURE THAT ALL ASSETS ARE CONTRIBUTING TO THE CORPORATION’S

STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES. THE RESULT IS AN EFFICIENT CAPITAL BASE, AND THE

CORPORATION HAS SELDOM HAD TO WRITE DOWN THE CARRYING VALUE OF ASSETS, EVEN

DURING PERIODS OF LOW COMMODITY PRICES.

RISK MANAGEMENT

THE

CORPORATION’S SIZE, STRONG CAPITAL STRUCTURE, GEOGRAPHIC DIVERSITY AND THE

COMPLEMENTARY NATURE OF THE UPSTREAM, DOWNSTREAM AND CHEMICAL BUSINESSES REDUCE

THE CORPORATION’S ENTERPRISE-WIDE RISK FROM CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES, CURRENCY

RATES AND COMMODITY PRICES. AS A RESULT, THE CORPORATION MAKES LIMITED USE OF

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS TO MITIGATE THE IMPACT OF SUCH CHANGES. WITH RESPECT TO

DERIVATIVES ACTIVITIES, THE CORPORATION BELIEVES THAT THERE ARE NO MATERIAL

MARKET OR CREDIT RISKS TO THE CORPORATION’S FINANCIAL POSITION, RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS OR LIQUIDITY AS A RESULT OF THE DERIVATIVES DESCRIBED IN NOTE 13.

THE CORPORATION DOES NOT ENGAGE IN SPECULATIVE DERIVATIVE ACTIVITIES OR

DERIVATIVE TRADING ACTIVITIES NOR DOES IT USE DERIVATIVES WITH LEVERAGED

FEATURES. CREDIT RISK ASSOCIATED WITH THE CORPORATION’S DERIVATIVE POSITION IS

MITIGATED BY SEVERAL FACTORS, INCLUDING THE USE OF DERIVATIVE CLEARING EXCHANGES

AND THE QUALITY OF AND FINANCIAL LIMITS PLACED ON DERIVATIVE COUNTERPARTIES.

THE CORPORATION MAINTAINS A SYSTEM OF CONTROLS THAT INCLUDES THE AUTHORIZATION,

REPORTING AND MONITORING OF DERIVATIVE ACTIVITY.

THE CORPORATION IS EXPOSED TO CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES, PRIMARILY ON

ITS SHORT-TERM DEBT AND THE PORTION OF LONG-TERM DEBT THAT CARRIES FLOATING

INTEREST RATES. THE IMPACT OF A 100-BASIS-POINT CHANGE IN INTEREST RATES

AFFECTING THE CORPORATION’S DEBT WOULD NOT BE MATERIAL TO EARNINGS, CASH FLOW

OR FAIR VALUE. THE CORPORATION HAS ACCESS TO SIGNIFICANT CAPACITY OF LONG-TERM

AND SHORT-TERM LIQUIDITY. INTERNALLY GENERATED FUNDS ARE EXPECTED TO COVER THE

MAJORITY OF FINANCIAL REQUIREMENTS, AND MAY BE SUPPLEMENTED BY LONG-TERM AND

SHORT-TERM DEBT, INCLUDING A REVOLVING COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAM. SOME

JOINT-VENTURE PARTNERS ARE DEPENDENT ON THE CREDIT MARKETS, AND THEIR FUNDING

ABILITY MAY IMPACT THE DEVELOPMENT PACE OF JOINT-VENTURE PROJECTS.

THE CORPORATION CONDUCTS BUSINESS IN MANY FOREIGN CURRENCIES AND IS

SUBJECT TO EXCHANGE RATE RISK ON CASH FLOWS RELATED TO SALES, EXPENSES,

FINANCING AND INVESTMENT TRANSACTIONS. THE IMPACTS OF FLUCTUATIONS IN EXCHANGE

RATES ON EXXONMOBIL’S GEOGRAPHICALLY AND FUNCTIONALLY DIVERSE OPERATIONS ARE

VARIED AND OFTEN OFFSETTING IN AMOUNT. THE CORPORATION MAKES LIMITED USE OF

CURRENCY EXCHANGE CONTRACTS TO MITIGATE THE IMPACT OF CHANGES IN CURRENCY

VALUES, AND EXPOSURES RELATED TO THE CORPORATION’S LIMITED USE OF THE CURRENCY

EXCHANGE CONTRACTS ARE NOT MATERIAL.

INFLATION AND OTHER UNCERTAINTIES

THE GENERAL

RATE OF INFLATION IN MANY MAJOR COUNTRIES OF OPERATION HAS REMAINED MODERATE

OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS, AND THE ASSOCIATED IMPACT ON NON-ENERGY COSTS HAS

GENERALLY BEEN MITIGATED BY COST REDUCTIONS FROM EFFICIENCY AND PRODUCTIVITY

IMPROVEMENTS. INCREASED DEMAND FOR CERTAIN SERVICES AND MATERIALS HAS RESULTED

IN HIGHER OPERATING AND CAPITAL COSTS IN RECENT YEARS. THE CORPORATION WORKS TO

COUNTER UPWARD PRESSURE ON COSTS THROUGH ITS ECONOMIES OF SCALE IN GLOBAL

PROCUREMENT AND ITS EFFICIENT PROJECT MANAGEMENT PRACTICES.

55

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL

CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

THE

CORPORATION’S ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL REPORTING FAIRLY REFLECT ITS

STRAIGHTFORWARD BUSINESS MODEL INVOLVING THE EXTRACTING, REFINING AND MARKETING

OF HYDROCARBONS AND HYDROCARBON-BASED PRODUCTS. THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS IN CONFORMITY WITH U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES

(GAAP) REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS THAT AFFECT THE

REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS, LIABILITIES, REVENUES AND EXPENSES AND THE

DISCLOSURE OF CONTINGENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. THE CORPORATION’S ACCOUNTING

POLICIES ARE SUMMARIZED IN NOTE 1.

OIL AND GAS RESERVES

EVALUATIONS

OF OIL AND GAS RESERVES ARE IMPORTANT TO THE EFFECTIVE MANAGEMENT OF UPSTREAM

ASSETS. THEY ARE AN INTEGRAL PART OF INVESTMENT DECISIONS ABOUT OIL AND GAS

PROPERTIES SUCH AS WHETHER DEVELOPMENT SHOULD PROCEED. OIL AND GAS RESERVE

QUANTITIES ARE ALSO USED AS THE BASIS TO CALCULATE UNIT-OF-PRODUCTION

DEPRECIATION RATES AND TO EVALUATE IMPAIRMENT.

OIL AND GAS RESERVES INCLUDE BOTH PROVED AND UNPROVED RESERVES. PROVED

OIL AND GAS RESERVES ARE THOSE QUANTITIES OF OIL AND GAS, WHICH, BY ANALYSIS OF

GEOSCIENCE AND ENGINEERING DATA, CAN BE ESTIMATED WITH REASONABLE CERTAINTY TO

BE ECONOMICALLY PRODUCIBLE. UNPROVED RESERVES ARE THOSE WITH LESS THAN

REASONABLE CERTAINTY OF RECOVERABILITY AND INCLUDE PROBABLE RESERVES. PROBABLE

RESERVES ARE RESERVES THAT ARE MORE LIKELY TO BE RECOVERED THAN NOT.

THE ESTIMATION OF PROVED RESERVES IS AN ONGOING PROCESS BASED ON

RIGOROUS TECHNICAL EVALUATIONS, COMMERCIAL AND MARKET ASSESSMENT, AND DETAILED

ANALYSIS OF WELL INFORMATION SUCH AS FLOW RATES AND RESERVOIR PRESSURE

DECLINES. THE ESTIMATION OF PROVED RESERVES IS CONTROLLED BY THE CORPORATION

THROUGH LONG-STANDING APPROVAL GUIDELINES. RESERVE CHANGES ARE MADE WITHIN A

WELL-ESTABLISHED, DISCIPLINED PROCESS DRIVEN BY SENIOR LEVEL GEOSCIENCE AND

ENGINEERING PROFESSIONALS, ASSISTED BY THE RESERVES TECHNICAL OVERSIGHT GROUP

WHICH HAS SIGNIFICANT TECHNICAL EXPERIENCE, CULMINATING IN REVIEWS WITH AND

APPROVAL BY SENIOR MANAGEMENT. NOTABLY, THE CORPORATION DOES NOT USE SPECIFIC

QUANTITATIVE RESERVE TARGETS TO DETERMINE COMPENSATION. KEY FEATURES OF THE

RESERVE ESTIMATION PROCESS ARE COVERED IN DISCLOSURE OF RESERVES IN

ITEM 2.

ALTHOUGH THE CORPORATION IS REASONABLY CERTAIN THAT PROVED RESERVES

WILL BE PRODUCED, THE TIMING AND AMOUNT RECOVERED CAN BE AFFECTED BY A NUMBER

OF FACTORS INCLUDING COMPLETION OF DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS, RESERVOIR PERFORMANCE,

REGULATORY APPROVALS AND SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN LONG-TERM OIL AND GAS PRICE

LEVELS.

PROVED RESERVES CAN BE FURTHER SUBDIVIDED INTO DEVELOPED AND

UNDEVELOPED RESERVES. THE PERCENTAGE OF PROVED DEVELOPED RESERVES WAS 66

PERCENT OF TOTAL PROVED RESERVES AT YEAR-END 2013 (INCLUDING BOTH CONSOLIDATED

AND EQUITY COMPANY RESERVES), AND HAS BEEN OVER 60 PERCENT FOR THE LAST TEN

YEARS, INDICATING THAT PROVED RESERVES ARE CONSISTENTLY MOVED FROM UNDEVELOPED

TO DEVELOPED STATUS.

REVISIONS CAN INCLUDE UPWARD OR DOWNWARD CHANGES IN PREVIOUSLY

ESTIMATED VOLUMES OF PROVED RESERVES FOR EXISTING FIELDS DUE TO THE EVALUATION

OR RE-EVALUATION OF (1) ALREADY AVAILABLE GEOLOGIC, RESERVOIR OR

PRODUCTION DATA, (2) NEW GEOLOGIC, RESERVOIR OR PRODUCTION DATA OR

(3) CHANGES IN PRICES AND YEAR-END COSTS THAT ARE USED IN THE ESTIMATION

OF RESERVES. REVISIONS CAN ALSO RESULT FROM SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN DEVELOPMENT

STRATEGY OR PRODUCTION EQUIPMENT/FACILITY CAPACITY.

IMPACT OF

OIL AND GAS RESERVES ON DEPRECIATION.

THE CALCULATION OF UNIT-OF-PRODUCTION DEPRECIATION IS A CRITICAL ACCOUNTING

ESTIMATE THAT MEASURES THE DEPRECIATION OF UPSTREAM ASSETS. IT IS THE RATIO OF

ACTUAL VOLUMES PRODUCED TO TOTAL PROVED DEVELOPED RESERVES (THOSE PROVED

RESERVES RECOVERABLE THROUGH EXISTING WELLS WITH EXISTING EQUIPMENT AND

OPERATING METHODS), APPLIED TO THE ASSET COST. THE VOLUMES PRODUCED AND ASSET

COST ARE KNOWN AND, WHILE PROVED DEVELOPED RESERVES HAVE A HIGH PROBABILITY OF

RECOVERABILITY, THEY ARE BASED ON ESTIMATES THAT ARE SUBJECT TO SOME

VARIABILITY. WHILE THE REVISIONS THE CORPORATION HAS MADE IN THE PAST ARE AN

INDICATOR OF VARIABILITY, THEY HAVE HAD A VERY SMALL IMPACT ON THE

UNIT-OF-PRODUCTION RATES BECAUSE THEY HAVE BEEN SMALL COMPARED TO THE LARGE

RESERVES BASE.

IMPACT OF

OIL AND GAS RESERVES AND PRICES ON TESTING FOR IMPAIRMENT.

PROVED OIL AND GAS PROPERTIES HELD AND USED BY THE

CORPORATION ARE REVIEWED FOR IMPAIRMENT WHENEVER EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES

INDICATE THAT THE CARRYING AMOUNTS MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE. ASSETS ARE GROUPED

AT THE LOWEST LEVEL FOR WHICH THERE ARE IDENTIFIABLE CASH FLOWS THAT ARE

LARGELY INDEPENDENT OF THE CASH FLOWS OF OTHER GROUPS OF ASSETS.

THE CORPORATION ESTIMATES THE FUTURE UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS OF THE

AFFECTED PROPERTIES TO JUDGE THE RECOVERABILITY OF CARRYING AMOUNTS. IMPAIRMENT

ANALYSES ARE GENERALLY BASED ON PROVED RESERVES. WHERE PROBABLE RESERVES EXIST,

AN APPROPRIATELY RISK-ADJUSTED AMOUNT OF THESE RESERVES MAY BE INCLUDED IN THE

IMPAIRMENT EVALUATION. AN ASSET GROUP WOULD BE IMPAIRED IF ITS UNDISCOUNTED

CASH FLOWS WERE LESS THAN THE ASSET’S CARRYING VALUE. IMPAIRMENTS ARE MEASURED

BY THE AMOUNT BY WHICH THE CARRYING VALUE EXCEEDS FAIR VALUE.

SIGNIFICANT UNPROVED PROPERTIES ARE ASSESSED FOR IMPAIRMENT

INDIVIDUALLY, AND VALUATION ALLOWANCES AGAINST THE CAPITALIZED COSTS ARE

RECORDED BASED ON THE ESTIMATED ECONOMIC CHANCE OF SUCCESS AND THE LENGTH OF

TIME THAT THE CORPORATION EXPECTS TO HOLD THE PROPERTIES. PROPERTIES THAT ARE

NOT INDIVIDUALLY SIGNIFICANT ARE AGGREGATED BY GROUPS AND AMORTIZED BASED ON

DEVELOPMENT RISK AND AVERAGE HOLDING PERIOD.

56

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL

CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

THE CORPORATION PERFORMS ASSET VALUATION ANALYSES ON

AN ONGOING BASIS AS A PART OF ITS ASSET MANAGEMENT PROGRAM. THESE ANALYSES

ASSIST THE CORPORATION IN ASSESSING WHETHER THE CARRYING AMOUNTS OF ANY OF ITS

ASSETS MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE. IN ADDITION TO ESTIMATING OIL AND GAS RESERVE

VOLUMES IN CONDUCTING THESE ANALYSES, IT IS ALSO NECESSARY TO ESTIMATE FUTURE

OIL AND GAS PRICES. POTENTIAL TRIGGER EVENTS FOR IMPAIRMENT EVALUATION INCLUDE

A SIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN CURRENT AND PROJECTED RESERVE VOLUMES, AN

ACCUMULATION OF PROJECT COSTS SIGNIFICANTLY IN EXCESS OF THE AMOUNT ORIGINALLY

EXPECTED, AND CURRENT PERIOD OPERATING LOSSES COMBINED WITH A HISTORY AND

FORECAST OF OPERATING OR CASH FLOW LOSSES.

IN GENERAL, THE CORPORATION DOES NOT VIEW TEMPORARILY LOW PRICES OR

MARGINS AS A TRIGGER EVENT FOR CONDUCTING THE IMPAIRMENT TESTS. THE MARKETS FOR

CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS HAVE A HISTORY OF SIGNIFICANT PRICE VOLATILITY.

ALTHOUGH PRICES WILL OCCASIONALLY DROP SIGNIFICANTLY, INDUSTRY PRICES OVER THE

LONG TERM WILL CONTINUE TO BE DRIVEN BY MARKET SUPPLY AND DEMAND. ON THE SUPPLY

SIDE, INDUSTRY PRODUCTION FROM MATURE FIELDS IS DECLINING, BUT THIS IS BEING

OFFSET BY PRODUCTION FROM NEW DISCOVERIES AND FIELD DEVELOPMENTS. OPEC

PRODUCTION POLICIES ALSO HAVE AN IMPACT ON WORLD OIL SUPPLIES. THE DEMAND SIDE

IS LARGELY A FUNCTION OF GLOBAL ECONOMIC GROWTH. THE RELATIVE GROWTH/DECLINE IN

SUPPLY VERSUS DEMAND WILL DETERMINE INDUSTRY PRICES OVER THE LONG TERM, AND

THESE CANNOT BE ACCURATELY PREDICTED.

ACCORDINGLY, ANY IMPAIRMENT TESTS THAT THE CORPORATION PERFORMS MAKE

USE OF THE CORPORATION’S PRICE ASSUMPTIONS DEVELOPED IN THE ANNUAL PLANNING AND

BUDGETING PROCESS FOR THE CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS MARKETS, PETROLEUM PRODUCTS

AND CHEMICALS. THESE ARE THE SAME PRICE ASSUMPTIONS THAT ARE USED FOR CAPITAL

INVESTMENT DECISIONS. VOLUMES ARE BASED ON FIELD PRODUCTION PROFILES, WHICH ARE

UPDATED ANNUALLY. CASH FLOW ESTIMATES FOR IMPAIRMENT TESTING EXCLUDE THE

EFFECTS OF DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS.

SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION REGARDING OIL AND GAS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,

CAPITALIZED COSTS AND RESERVES IS PROVIDED FOLLOWING THE NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. FUTURE PRICES USED FOR ANY IMPAIRMENT TESTS WILL VARY

FROM THE ONES USED IN THE SUPPLEMENTAL OIL AND GAS DISCLOSURE AND COULD BE

LOWER OR HIGHER FOR ANY GIVEN YEAR.

ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS

THE

CORPORATION INCURS RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS FOR CERTAIN ASSETS. THE FAIR VALUES

OF THESE OBLIGATIONS ARE RECORDED AS LIABILITIES ON A DISCOUNTED BASIS, WHICH

IS TYPICALLY AT THE TIME THE ASSETS ARE INSTALLED. IN THE ESTIMATION OF FAIR

VALUE, THE CORPORATION USES ASSUMPTIONS AND JUDGMENTS REGARDING SUCH FACTORS AS

THE EXISTENCE OF A LEGAL OBLIGATION FOR AN ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATION;

TECHNICAL ASSESSMENTS OF THE ASSETS; ESTIMATED AMOUNTS AND TIMING OF

SETTLEMENTS; DISCOUNT RATES; AND INFLATION RATES. ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS

ARE DISCLOSED IN NOTE 9 TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

SUSPENDED EXPLORATORY WELL COSTS

THE

CORPORATION CONTINUES CAPITALIZATION OF EXPLORATORY WELL COSTS WHEN THE WELL

HAS FOUND A SUFFICIENT QUANTITY OF RESERVES TO JUSTIFY ITS COMPLETION AS A

PRODUCING WELL AND THE CORPORATION IS MAKING SUFFICIENT PROGRESS ASSESSING THE

RESERVES AND THE ECONOMIC AND OPERATING VIABILITY OF THE PROJECT. EXPLORATORY

WELL COSTS NOT MEETING THESE CRITERIA ARE CHARGED TO EXPENSE. THE FACTS AND

CIRCUMSTANCES THAT SUPPORT CONTINUED CAPITALIZATION OF SUSPENDED WELLS AT YEAR-END

ARE DISCLOSED IN NOTE 10 TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

CONSOLIDATIONS

THE

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDE THE ACCOUNTS OF THOSE SUBSIDIARIES

THAT THE CORPORATION CONTROLS. THEY ALSO INCLUDE THE CORPORATION’S SHARE OF THE

UNDIVIDED INTEREST IN CERTAIN UPSTREAM ASSETS, LIABILITIES, REVENUES AND

EXPENSES. AMOUNTS REPRESENTING THE CORPORATION’S INTEREST IN THE UNDERLYING NET

ASSETS OF OTHER SIGNIFICANT ENTITIES THAT IT DOES NOT CONTROL, BUT OVER WHICH

IT EXERCISES SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE, ARE ACCOUNTED FOR USING THE EQUITY METHOD

OF ACCOUNTING.

INVESTMENTS IN COMPANIES THAT ARE PARTIALLY OWNED BY

THE CORPORATION ARE INTEGRAL TO THE CORPORATION’S OPERATIONS. IN SOME CASES

THEY SERVE TO BALANCE WORLDWIDE RISKS, AND IN OTHERS THEY PROVIDE THE ONLY

AVAILABLE MEANS OF ENTRY INTO A PARTICULAR MARKET OR AREA OF INTEREST. THE

OTHER PARTIES WHO ALSO HAVE AN EQUITY INTEREST IN THESE COMPANIES ARE EITHER

INDEPENDENT THIRD PARTIES OR HOST GOVERNMENTS THAT SHARE IN THE BUSINESS

RESULTS ACCORDING TO THEIR OWNERSHIP. THE CORPORATION DOES NOT INVEST IN THESE

COMPANIES IN ORDER TO REMOVE LIABILITIES FROM ITS BALANCE SHEET. IN FACT, THE

CORPORATION HAS LONG BEEN ON RECORD SUPPORTING AN ALTERNATIVE ACCOUNTING METHOD

THAT WOULD REQUIRE EACH INVESTOR TO CONSOLIDATE ITS SHARE OF ALL ASSETS AND

LIABILITIES IN THESE PARTIALLY OWNED COMPANIES RATHER THAN ONLY ITS INTEREST IN

NET EQUITY. THIS METHOD OF ACCOUNTING FOR INVESTMENTS IN PARTIALLY-OWNED

COMPANIES IS NOT PERMITTED BY U.S. GAAP EXCEPT WHERE THE INVESTMENTS ARE IN THE

DIRECT OWNERSHIP OF A SHARE OF UPSTREAM ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. HOWEVER, FOR

PURPOSES OF CALCULATING RETURN ON AVERAGE CAPITAL EMPLOYED, WHICH IS NOT

COVERED BY U.S. GAAP STANDARDS, THE CORPORATION INCLUDES ITS SHARE OF DEBT OF

THESE PARTIALLY-OWNED COMPANIES IN THE DETERMINATION OF AVERAGE CAPITAL

EMPLOYED.

57

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL

CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

PENSION BENEFITS

THE

CORPORATION AND ITS AFFILIATES SPONSOR OVER 100 DEFINED BENEFIT (PENSION) PLANS

IN ABOUT 50 COUNTRIES. PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS (NOTE 17)

PROVIDES DETAILS ON PENSION OBLIGATIONS, FUND ASSETS AND PENSION EXPENSE.

SOME OF THESE PLANS (PRIMARILY NON-U.S.) PROVIDE

PENSION BENEFITS THAT ARE PAID DIRECTLY BY THEIR SPONSORING AFFILIATES OUT OF

CORPORATE CASH FLOW RATHER THAN A SEPARATE PENSION FUND. BOOK RESERVES ARE

ESTABLISHED FOR THESE PLANS BECAUSE TAX CONVENTIONS AND REGULATORY PRACTICES DO

NOT ENCOURAGE ADVANCE FUNDING. THE PORTION OF THE PENSION COST ATTRIBUTABLE TO

EMPLOYEE SERVICE IS EXPENSED AS SERVICES ARE RENDERED. THE PORTION ATTRIBUTABLE

TO THE INCREASE IN PENSION OBLIGATIONS DUE TO THE PASSAGE OF TIME IS EXPENSED OVER

THE TERM OF THE OBLIGATIONS, WHICH ENDS WHEN ALL BENEFITS ARE PAID. THE PRIMARY

DIFFERENCE IN PENSION EXPENSE FOR UNFUNDED VERSUS FUNDED PLANS IS THAT PENSION

EXPENSE FOR FUNDED PLANS ALSO INCLUDES A CREDIT FOR THE EXPECTED LONG-TERM

RETURN ON FUND ASSETS.

FOR FUNDED PLANS, INCLUDING THOSE IN THE U.S., PENSION

OBLIGATIONS ARE FINANCED IN ADVANCE THROUGH SEGREGATED ASSETS OR INSURANCE

ARRANGEMENTS. THESE PLANS ARE MANAGED IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE REQUIREMENTS OF

GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORITIES AND MEET OR EXCEED REQUIRED FUNDING LEVELS AS MEASURED

BY RELEVANT ACTUARIAL AND GOVERNMENT STANDARDS AT THE MANDATED MEASUREMENT

DATES. IN DETERMINING LIABILITIES AND REQUIRED CONTRIBUTIONS, THESE STANDARDS

OFTEN REQUIRE APPROACHES AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT DIFFER FROM THOSE USED FOR

ACCOUNTING PURPOSES.

THE CORPORATION WILL CONTINUE TO MAKE CONTRIBUTIONS TO

THESE FUNDED PLANS AS NECESSARY. ALL DEFINED-BENEFIT PENSION OBLIGATIONS,

REGARDLESS OF THE FUNDING STATUS OF THE UNDERLYING PLANS, ARE FULLY SUPPORTED

BY THE FINANCIAL STRENGTH OF THE CORPORATION OR THE RESPECTIVE SPONSORING

AFFILIATE.

PENSION ACCOUNTING REQUIRES EXPLICIT ASSUMPTIONS

REGARDING, AMONG OTHERS, THE LONG-TERM EXPECTED EARNINGS RATE ON FUND ASSETS,

THE DISCOUNT RATE FOR THE BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS AND THE LONG-TERM RATE FOR FUTURE

SALARY INCREASES. PENSION ASSUMPTIONS ARE REVIEWED ANNUALLY BY OUTSIDE

ACTUARIES AND SENIOR MANAGEMENT. THESE ASSUMPTIONS ARE ADJUSTED AS APPROPRIATE

TO REFLECT CHANGES IN MARKET RATES AND OUTLOOK. THE LONG-TERM EXPECTED EARNINGS

RATE ON U.S. PENSION PLAN ASSETS IN 2013 WAS 7.25 PERCENT. THE 10‐YEAR

AND 20‐YEAR ACTUAL RETURNS ON U.S. PENSION PLAN ASSETS WERE 7 PERCENT AND

9 PERCENT, RESPECTIVELY. THE CORPORATION ESTABLISHES THE LONG-TERM EXPECTED

RATE OF RETURN BY DEVELOPING A FORWARD-LOOKING, LONG-TERM RETURN ASSUMPTION FOR

EACH PENSION FUND ASSET CLASS, TAKING INTO ACCOUNT FACTORS SUCH AS THE EXPECTED

REAL RETURN FOR THE SPECIFIC ASSET CLASS AND INFLATION. A SINGLE, LONG-TERM

RATE OF RETURN IS THEN CALCULATED AS THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE OF THE TARGET ASSET

ALLOCATION PERCENTAGES AND THE LONG-TERM RETURN ASSUMPTION FOR EACH ASSET

CLASS. A WORLDWIDE REDUCTION OF 0.5 PERCENT IN THE LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN ON

ASSETS WOULD INCREASE ANNUAL PENSION EXPENSE BY APPROXIMATELY $150 MILLION

BEFORE TAX.

DIFFERENCES BETWEEN ACTUAL RETURNS ON FUND ASSETS AND

THE LONG-TERM EXPECTED RETURN ARE NOT RECOGNIZED IN PENSION EXPENSE IN THE YEAR

THAT THE DIFFERENCE OCCURS. SUCH DIFFERENCES ARE DEFERRED, ALONG WITH OTHER

ACTUARIAL GAINS AND LOSSES, AND ARE AMORTIZED INTO PENSION EXPENSE OVER THE

EXPECTED REMAINING SERVICE LIFE OF EMPLOYEES.

LITIGATION CONTINGENCIES

A

VARIETY OF CLAIMS HAVE BEEN MADE AGAINST THE CORPORATION AND CERTAIN OF ITS

CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES IN A NUMBER OF PENDING LAWSUITS. MANAGEMENT HAS REGULAR

LITIGATION REVIEWS, INCLUDING UPDATES FROM CORPORATE AND OUTSIDE COUNSEL, TO

ASSESS THE NEED FOR ACCOUNTING RECOGNITION OR DISCLOSURE OF THESE

CONTINGENCIES. THE STATUS OF SIGNIFICANT CLAIMS IS SUMMARIZED IN NOTE 16.

THE CORPORATION ACCRUES AN UNDISCOUNTED LIABILITY FOR

THOSE CONTINGENCIES WHERE THE INCURRENCE OF A LOSS IS PROBABLE, AND THE AMOUNT

CAN BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED. THESE AMOUNTS ARE NOT REDUCED BY AMOUNTS THAT MAY

BE RECOVERED UNDER INSURANCE OR CLAIMS AGAINST THIRD PARTIES, BUT UNDISCOUNTED

RECEIVABLES FROM INSURERS OR OTHER THIRD PARTIES MAY BE ACCRUED SEPARATELY. THE

CORPORATION REVISES SUCH ACCRUALS IN LIGHT OF NEW INFORMATION. FOR

CONTINGENCIES WHERE AN UNFAVORABLE OUTCOME IS REASONABLY POSSIBLE AND WHICH ARE

SIGNIFICANT, THE CORPORATION DISCLOSES THE NATURE OF THE CONTINGENCY AND, WHERE

FEASIBLE, AN ESTIMATE OF THE POSSIBLE LOSS. FOR PURPOSES OF OUR LITIGATION

CONTINGENCY DISCLOSURES, “SIGNIFICANT” INCLUDES MATERIAL MATTERS AS WELL AS

OTHER ITEMS WHICH MANAGEMENT BELIEVES SHOULD BE DISCLOSED.

MANAGEMENT JUDGMENT IS REQUIRED RELATED TO CONTINGENT

LIABILITIES AND THE OUTCOME OF LITIGATION BECAUSE BOTH ARE DIFFICULT TO

PREDICT. HOWEVER, THE CORPORATION HAS BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN DEFENDING LITIGATION

IN THE PAST. PAYMENTS HAVE NOT HAD A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OPERATIONS OR

FINANCIAL CONDITION. IN THE CORPORATION’S EXPERIENCE, LARGE CLAIMS OFTEN DO NOT

RESULT IN LARGE AWARDS. LARGE AWARDS ARE OFTEN REVERSED OR SUBSTANTIALLY

REDUCED AS A RESULT OF APPEAL OR SETTLEMENT.

TAX CONTINGENCIES

THE

CORPORATION IS SUBJECT TO INCOME TAXATION IN MANY JURISDICTIONS AROUND THE

WORLD. SIGNIFICANT MANAGEMENT JUDGMENT IS REQUIRED IN THE ACCOUNTING FOR INCOME

TAX CONTINGENCIES AND TAX DISPUTES BECAUSE THE OUTCOMES ARE OFTEN DIFFICULT TO

PREDICT.

THE BENEFITS OF UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS

THAT THE CORPORATION HAS TAKEN OR EXPECTS TO TAKE IN ITS INCOME TAX RETURNS ARE

RECOGNIZED IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IF MANAGEMENT CONCLUDES THAT IT IS MORE

LIKELY THAN NOT THAT THE POSITION WILL BE SUSTAINED

58

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL

CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

WITH

THE TAX AUTHORITIES. FOR A POSITION THAT IS LIKELY TO BE SUSTAINED, THE BENEFIT

RECOGNIZED IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IS MEASURED AT THE LARGEST AMOUNT THAT

IS GREATER THAN 50 PERCENT LIKELY OF BEING REALIZED. A RESERVE IS ESTABLISHED

FOR THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A POSITION TAKEN OR EXPECTED TO BE TAKEN IN AN

INCOME TAX RETURN AND THE AMOUNT RECOGNIZED IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. THE

CORPORATION’S UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS AND A DESCRIPTION OF OPEN TAX YEARS ARE

SUMMARIZED IN NOTE 19.

FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION

THE

METHOD OF TRANSLATING THE FOREIGN CURRENCY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF THE

CORPORATION’S INTERNATIONAL SUBSIDIARIES INTO U.S. DOLLARS IS PRESCRIBED BY

GAAP. UNDER THESE PRINCIPLES, IT IS NECESSARY TO SELECT THE FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY

OF THESE SUBSIDIARIES. THE FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY IS THE CURRENCY OF THE PRIMARY

ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH THE SUBSIDIARY OPERATES. MANAGEMENT SELECTS THE

FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY AFTER EVALUATING THIS ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT.

FACTORS CONSIDERED BY MANAGEMENT WHEN DETERMINING THE FUNCTIONAL

CURRENCY FOR A SUBSIDIARY INCLUDE THE CURRENCY USED FOR CASH FLOWS RELATED TO

INDIVIDUAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES; THE RESPONSIVENESS OF SALES PRICES TO

CHANGES IN EXCHANGE RATES; THE HISTORY OF INFLATION IN THE COUNTRY; WHETHER

SALES ARE INTO LOCAL MARKETS OR EXPORTED; THE CURRENCY USED TO ACQUIRE RAW

MATERIALS, LABOR, SERVICES AND SUPPLIES; SOURCES OF FINANCING; AND SIGNIFICANCE

OF INTERCOMPANY TRANSACTIONS.

MANAGEMENT’S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL

REPORTING

MANAGEMENT, INCLUDING THE CORPORATION’S CHIEF EXECUTIVE

OFFICER, PRINCIPAL FINANCIAL OFFICER, AND PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING OFFICER, IS

RESPONSIBLE FOR ESTABLISHING AND MAINTAINING ADEQUATE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER THE

CORPORATION’S FINANCIAL REPORTING. MANAGEMENT CONDUCTED AN EVALUATION OF THE

EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING BASED ON CRITERIA

ESTABLISHED IN

INTERNAL CONTROL – INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK (1992)

ISSUED BY THE COMMITTEE OF SPONSORING ORGANIZATIONS OF THE TREADWAY COMMISSION.

BASED ON THIS EVALUATION, MANAGEMENT CONCLUDED THAT EXXON MOBIL CORPORATION’S

INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING WAS EFFECTIVE AS OF DECEMBER 31,

2013.

PRICEWATERHOUSECOOPERS LLP, AN INDEPENDENT REGISTERED

PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM, AUDITED THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE CORPORATION’S INTERNAL

CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2013, AS STATED IN

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED

PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

TO THE SHAREHOLDERS OF EXXON MOBIL

CORPORATION.

IN OUR OPINION, THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED BALANCE

SHEETS AND THE RELATED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME, COMPREHENSIVE INCOME,

CHANGES IN EQUITY AND CASH FLOWS PRESENT FAIRLY, IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS, THE

FINANCIAL POSITION OF EXXON MOBIL CORPORATION AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES AT

DECEMBER 31, 2013, AND 2012, AND THE RESULTS OF THEIR OPERATIONS AND THEIR

CASH FLOWS FOR EACH OF THE THREE YEARS IN THE PERIOD ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2013,

IN CONFORMITY WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED

STATES OF AMERICA. ALSO IN OUR OPINION, THE CORPORATION MAINTAINED, IN ALL

MATERIAL RESPECTS, EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2013, BASED ON CRITERIA ESTABLISHED IN

INTERNAL CONTROL –

INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK (1992)

ISSUED BY THE COMMITTEE OF SPONSORING

ORGANIZATIONS OF THE TREADWAY COMMISSION (COSO). THE CORPORATION’S MANAGEMENT

IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, FOR MAINTAINING EFFECTIVE

INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AND FOR ITS ASSESSMENT OF THE

EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, INCLUDED IN THE

ACCOMPANYING MANAGEMENT’S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING.

OUR RESPONSIBILITY IS TO EXPRESS OPINIONS ON THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND ON

THE CORPORATION’S INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING BASED ON OUR

INTEGRATED AUDITS. WE CONDUCTED OUR AUDITS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE STANDARDS OF

THE PUBLIC COMPANY ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BOARD (UNITED STATES). THOSE STANDARDS

REQUIRE THAT WE PLAN AND PERFORM THE AUDITS TO OBTAIN REASONABLE ASSURANCE

ABOUT WHETHER THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE FREE OF MATERIAL MISSTATEMENT AND

WHETHER EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING WAS MAINTAINED IN

ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS. OUR AUDITS OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED

EXAMINING, ON A TEST BASIS, EVIDENCE SUPPORTING THE AMOUNTS AND DISCLOSURES IN

THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, ASSESSING THE ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES USED AND

SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES MADE BY MANAGEMENT, AND EVALUATING THE OVERALL FINANCIAL

STATEMENT PRESENTATION. OUR AUDIT OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

INCLUDED OBTAINING AN UNDERSTANDING OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL

REPORTING, ASSESSING THE RISK THAT A MATERIAL WEAKNESS EXISTS, AND TESTING AND

EVALUATING THE DESIGN AND OPERATING EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL CONTROL BASED ON

THE ASSESSED RISK. OUR AUDITS ALSO INCLUDED PERFORMING SUCH OTHER PROCEDURES AS

WE CONSIDERED NECESSARY IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR AUDITS

PROVIDE A REASONABLE BASIS FOR OUR OPINIONS.

A COMPANY’S INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

IS A PROCESS DESIGNED TO PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING THE RELIABILITY

OF FINANCIAL REPORTING AND THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR EXTERNAL

PURPOSES IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES. A

COMPANY’S INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING INCLUDES THOSE POLICIES AND

PROCEDURES THAT (I) PERTAIN TO THE MAINTENANCE OF RECORDS THAT, IN

REASONABLE DETAIL, ACCURATELY AND FAIRLY REFLECT THE TRANSACTIONS AND

DISPOSITIONS OF THE ASSETS OF THE COMPANY; (II) PROVIDE REASONABLE

ASSURANCE THAT TRANSACTIONS ARE RECORDED AS NECESSARY TO PERMIT PREPARATION OF

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING

PRINCIPLES, AND THAT RECEIPTS AND EXPENDITURES OF THE COMPANY ARE BEING MADE

ONLY IN ACCORDANCE WITH AUTHORIZATIONS OF MANAGEMENT AND DIRECTORS OF THE

COMPANY; AND (III) PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING PREVENTION OR

TIMELY DETECTION OF UNAUTHORIZED ACQUISITION, USE, OR DISPOSITION OF THE

COMPANY’S ASSETS THAT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

BECAUSE OF ITS INHERENT LIMITATIONS, INTERNAL CONTROL

OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING MAY NOT PREVENT OR DETECT MISSTATEMENTS. ALSO,

PROJECTIONS OF ANY EVALUATION OF EFFECTIVENESS TO FUTURE PERIODS ARE SUBJECT TO

THE RISK THAT CONTROLS MAY BECOME INADEQUATE BECAUSE OF CHANGES IN CONDITIONS,

OR THAT THE DEGREE OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE POLICIES OR PROCEDURES MAY

DETERIORATE.

THE

INFORMATION IN THE NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IS AN INTEGRAL

PART OF THESE STATEMENTS.

66

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND

THE SUPPORTING AND SUPPLEMENTAL MATERIAL ARE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE

MANAGEMENT OF EXXON MOBIL CORPORATION.

THE CORPORATION’S PRINCIPAL BUSINESS IS ENERGY,

INVOLVING THE WORLDWIDE EXPLORATION, PRODUCTION, TRANSPORTATION AND SALE OF

CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS (UPSTREAM) AND THE MANUFACTURE, TRANSPORTATION AND

SALE OF PETROLEUM PRODUCTS (DOWNSTREAM). THE CORPORATION IS ALSO A MAJOR

WORLDWIDE MANUFACTURER AND MARKETER OF PETROCHEMICALS (CHEMICAL) AND

PARTICIPATES IN ELECTRIC POWER GENERATION (UPSTREAM).

THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN CONFORMITY

WITH U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES (GAAP) REQUIRES MANAGEMENT

TO MAKE ESTIMATES THAT AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS, LIABILITIES,

REVENUES AND EXPENSES AND THE DISCLOSURE OF CONTINGENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES.

ACTUAL RESULTS COULD DIFFER FROM THESE ESTIMATES. PRIOR YEARS’ DATA HAS BEEN

RECLASSIFIED IN CERTAIN CASES TO CONFORM TO THE 2013 PRESENTATION BASIS.

1. SUMMARY OF ACCOUNTING POLICIES

PRINCIPLES

OF CONSOLIDATION.

THE CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDE THE ACCOUNTS OF SUBSIDIARIES THE CORPORATION

CONTROLS. THEY ALSO INCLUDE THE CORPORATION’S SHARE OF THE UNDIVIDED INTEREST

IN CERTAIN UPSTREAM ASSETS, LIABILITIES, REVENUES AND EXPENSES.

AMOUNTS REPRESENTING THE CORPORATION’S INTEREST IN

ENTITIES THAT IT DOES NOT CONTROL, BUT OVER WHICH IT EXERCISES SIGNIFICANT

INFLUENCE, ARE INCLUDED IN “INVESTMENTS, ADVANCES AND LONG-TERM RECEIVABLES.”

THE CORPORATION’S SHARE OF THE NET INCOME OF THESE COMPANIES IS INCLUDED IN THE

CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF INCOME CAPTION “INCOME FROM EQUITY AFFILIATES.”

MAJORITY OWNERSHIP IS NORMALLY THE INDICATOR OF

CONTROL THAT IS THE BASIS ON WHICH SUBSIDIARIES ARE CONSOLIDATED. HOWEVER,

CERTAIN FACTORS MAY INDICATE THAT A MAJORITY-OWNED INVESTMENT IS NOT CONTROLLED

AND THEREFORE SHOULD BE ACCOUNTED FOR USING THE EQUITY METHOD OF ACCOUNTING.

THESE FACTORS OCCUR WHERE THE MINORITY SHAREHOLDERS ARE GRANTED BY LAW OR BY

CONTRACT SUBSTANTIVE PARTICIPATING RIGHTS. THESE INCLUDE THE RIGHT TO APPROVE

OPERATING POLICIES, EXPENSE BUDGETS, FINANCING AND INVESTMENT PLANS, AND

MANAGEMENT COMPENSATION AND SUCCESSION PLANS.

THE CORPORATION’S SHARE OF THE CUMULATIVE FOREIGN

EXCHANGE TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENT FOR EQUITY METHOD INVESTMENTS IS REPORTED IN ACCUMULATED

OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME.

EVIDENCE OF LOSS IN VALUE THAT MIGHT INDICATE

IMPAIRMENT OF INVESTMENTS IN COMPANIES ACCOUNTED FOR ON THE EQUITY METHOD IS

ASSESSED TO DETERMINE IF SUCH EVIDENCE REPRESENTS A LOSS IN VALUE OF THE

CORPORATION’S INVESTMENT THAT IS OTHER THAN TEMPORARY. EXAMPLES OF KEY

INDICATORS INCLUDE A HISTORY OF OPERATING LOSSES, A NEGATIVE EARNINGS AND CASH

FLOW OUTLOOK, SIGNIFICANT DOWNWARD REVISIONS TO OIL AND GAS RESERVES, AND THE

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND PROSPECTS FOR THE INVESTEE’S BUSINESS SEGMENT OR

GEOGRAPHIC REGION. IF EVIDENCE OF AN OTHER THAN TEMPORARY LOSS IN FAIR VALUE

BELOW CARRYING AMOUNT IS DETERMINED, AN IMPAIRMENT IS RECOGNIZED. IN THE

ABSENCE OF MARKET PRICES FOR THE INVESTMENT, DISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS ARE USED TO

ASSESS FAIR VALUE.

REVENUE

RECOGNITION.

THE CORPORATION

GENERALLY SELLS CRUDE OIL, NATURAL GAS AND PETROLEUM AND CHEMICAL PRODUCTS

UNDER SHORT-TERM AGREEMENTS AT PREVAILING MARKET PRICES. IN SOME CASES (E.G.,

NATURAL GAS), PRODUCTS MAY BE SOLD UNDER LONG-TERM AGREEMENTS, WITH PERIODIC

PRICE ADJUSTMENTS. REVENUES ARE RECOGNIZED WHEN THE PRODUCTS ARE DELIVERED,

WHICH OCCURS WHEN THE CUSTOMER HAS TAKEN TITLE AND HAS ASSUMED THE RISKS AND

REWARDS OF OWNERSHIP, PRICES ARE FIXED OR DETERMINABLE AND COLLECTIBILITY IS

REASONABLY ASSURED.

REVENUES FROM THE PRODUCTION OF NATURAL GAS PROPERTIES

IN WHICH THE CORPORATION HAS AN INTEREST WITH OTHER PRODUCERS ARE RECOGNIZED ON

THE BASIS OF THE CORPORATION’S NET WORKING INTEREST. DIFFERENCES BETWEEN ACTUAL

PRODUCTION AND NET WORKING INTEREST VOLUMES ARE NOT SIGNIFICANT.

PURCHASES AND SALES OF INVENTORY WITH THE SAME

COUNTERPARTY THAT ARE ENTERED INTO IN CONTEMPLATION OF ONE ANOTHER ARE COMBINED

AND RECORDED AS EXCHANGES MEASURED AT THE BOOK VALUE OF THE ITEM SOLD.

SALES-BASED

TAXES.

THE CORPORATION REPORTS SALES,

EXCISE AND VALUE-ADDED TAXES ON SALES TRANSACTIONS ON A GROSS BASIS IN THE

CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF INCOME (INCLUDED IN BOTH REVENUES AND COSTS).

DERIVATIVE

INSTRUMENTS.

THE CORPORATION MAKES

LIMITED USE OF DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS. THE CORPORATION DOES NOT ENGAGE IN

SPECULATIVE DERIVATIVE ACTIVITIES OR DERIVATIVE TRADING ACTIVITIES, NOR DOES IT

USE DERIVATIVES WITH LEVERAGED FEATURES. WHEN THE CORPORATION DOES ENTER INTO DERIVATIVE

TRANSACTIONS, IT IS TO OFFSET EXPOSURES ASSOCIATED WITH INTEREST RATES, FOREIGN

CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES AND HYDROCARBON PRICES THAT ARISE FROM EXISTING ASSETS,

LIABILITIES AND FORECASTED TRANSACTIONS.

THE GAINS AND LOSSES RESULTING FROM CHANGES IN THE

FAIR VALUE OF DERIVATIVES ARE RECORDED IN INCOME. IN SOME CASES, THE

CORPORATION DESIGNATES DERIVATIVES AS FAIR VALUE HEDGES, IN WHICH CASE THE

GAINS AND LOSSES ARE OFFSET IN INCOME BY THE GAINS AND LOSSES ARISING FROM

CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE UNDERLYING HEDGED ITEM.

FAIR

VALUE.

FAIR VALUE IS THE PRICE THAT

WOULD BE RECEIVED TO SELL AN ASSET OR PAID TO TRANSFER A LIABILITY IN AN

ORDERLY TRANSACTION BETWEEN MARKET PARTICIPANTS. HIERARCHY LEVELS 1, 2 AND 3

ARE TERMS FOR THE PRIORITY OF INPUTS TO VALUATION TECHNIQUES USED TO MEASURE

FAIR VALUE. HIERARCHY LEVEL 1 INPUTS ARE QUOTED PRICES IN ACTIVE MARKETS FOR

IDENTICAL ASSETS OR LIABILITIES. HIERARCHY

67

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

LEVEL 2

INPUTS ARE INPUTS OTHER THAN QUOTED PRICES INCLUDED WITHIN LEVEL 1 THAT

ARE DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY OBSERVABLE FOR THE ASSET OR LIABILITY. HIERARCHY

LEVEL 3 INPUTS ARE INPUTS THAT ARE NOT OBSERVABLE IN THE MARKET.

INVENTORIES.

CRUDE OIL, PRODUCTS AND MERCHANDISE

INVENTORIES ARE CARRIED AT THE LOWER OF CURRENT MARKET VALUE OR COST (GENERALLY

DETERMINED UNDER THE LAST-IN, FIRST-OUT METHOD – LIFO). INVENTORY COSTS INCLUDE

EXPENDITURES AND OTHER CHARGES (INCLUDING DEPRECIATION) DIRECTLY AND INDIRECTLY

INCURRED IN BRINGING THE INVENTORY TO ITS EXISTING CONDITION AND LOCATION.

SELLING EXPENSES AND GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES ARE REPORTED AS PERIOD

COSTS AND EXCLUDED FROM INVENTORY COST. INVENTORIES OF MATERIALS AND SUPPLIES

ARE VALUED AT COST OR LESS.

PROPERTY,

PLANT AND EQUIPMENT.

DEPRECIATION,

DEPLETION AND AMORTIZATION, BASED ON COST LESS ESTIMATED SALVAGE VALUE OF THE

ASSET, ARE PRIMARILY DETERMINED UNDER EITHER THE UNIT-OF-PRODUCTION METHOD OR

THE STRAIGHT-LINE METHOD, WHICH IS BASED ON ESTIMATED ASSET SERVICE LIFE TAKING

OBSOLESCENCE INTO CONSIDERATION. MAINTENANCE AND REPAIRS, INCLUDING PLANNED

MAJOR MAINTENANCE, ARE EXPENSED AS INCURRED. MAJOR RENEWALS AND IMPROVEMENTS

ARE CAPITALIZED AND THE ASSETS REPLACED ARE RETIRED.

INTEREST COSTS INCURRED TO FINANCE EXPENDITURES DURING

THE CONSTRUCTION PHASE OF MULTIYEAR PROJECTS ARE CAPITALIZED AS PART OF THE

HISTORICAL COST OF ACQUIRING THE CONSTRUCTED ASSETS. THE PROJECT CONSTRUCTION

PHASE COMMENCES WITH THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE DETAILED ENGINEERING DESIGN AND

ENDS WHEN THE CONSTRUCTED ASSETS ARE READY FOR THEIR INTENDED USE. CAPITALIZED

INTEREST COSTS ARE INCLUDED IN PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT AND ARE

DEPRECIATED OVER THE SERVICE LIFE OF THE RELATED ASSETS.

THE CORPORATION USES THE “SUCCESSFUL EFFORTS” METHOD

TO ACCOUNT FOR ITS EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION ACTIVITIES. UNDER THIS METHOD,

COSTS ARE ACCUMULATED ON A FIELD-BY-FIELD BASIS WITH CERTAIN EXPLORATORY

EXPENDITURES AND EXPLORATORY DRY HOLES BEING EXPENSED AS INCURRED. COSTS OF

PRODUCTIVE WELLS AND DEVELOPMENT DRY HOLES ARE CAPITALIZED AND AMORTIZED ON THE

UNIT-OF-PRODUCTION METHOD.

THE CORPORATION CARRIES AS AN ASSET EXPLORATORY WELL

COSTS WHEN THE WELL HAS FOUND A SUFFICIENT QUANTITY OF RESERVES TO JUSTIFY ITS

COMPLETION AS A PRODUCING WELL AND WHERE THE CORPORATION IS MAKING SUFFICIENT

PROGRESS ASSESSING THE RESERVES AND THE ECONOMIC AND OPERATING VIABILITY OF THE

PROJECT. EXPLORATORY WELL COSTS NOT MEETING THESE CRITERIA ARE CHARGED TO

EXPENSE. OTHER EXPLORATORY EXPENDITURES, INCLUDING GEOPHYSICAL COSTS AND ANNUAL

LEASE RENTALS, ARE EXPENSED AS INCURRED.

ACQUISITION COSTS OF PROVED PROPERTIES ARE AMORTIZED

USING A UNIT-OF-PRODUCTION METHOD, COMPUTED ON THE BASIS OF TOTAL PROVED OIL

AND GAS RESERVES.

CAPITALIZED EXPLORATORY DRILLING AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS

ASSOCIATED WITH PRODUCTIVE DEPLETABLE EXTRACTIVE PROPERTIES ARE AMORTIZED USING

UNIT-OF-PRODUCTION RATES BASED ON THE AMOUNT OF PROVED DEVELOPED RESERVES OF

OIL, GAS AND OTHER MINERALS THAT ARE ESTIMATED TO BE RECOVERABLE FROM EXISTING

FACILITIES USING CURRENT OPERATING METHODS.

UNDER THE UNIT-OF-PRODUCTION METHOD, OIL AND GAS

VOLUMES ARE CONSIDERED PRODUCED ONCE THEY HAVE BEEN MEASURED THROUGH METERS AT

CUSTODY TRANSFER OR SALES TRANSACTION POINTS AT THE OUTLET VALVE ON THE LEASE

OR FIELD STORAGE TANK.

PRODUCTION INVOLVES LIFTING THE OIL AND GAS TO THE

SURFACE AND GATHERING, TREATING, FIELD PROCESSING AND FIELD STORAGE OF THE OIL

AND GAS. THE PRODUCTION FUNCTION NORMALLY TERMINATES AT THE OUTLET VALVE ON THE

LEASE OR FIELD PRODUCTION STORAGE TANK. PRODUCTION COSTS ARE THOSE INCURRED TO

OPERATE AND MAINTAIN THE CORPORATION’S WELLS AND RELATED EQUIPMENT AND

FACILITIES AND ARE EXPENSED AS INCURRED. THEY BECOME PART OF THE COST OF OIL

AND GAS PRODUCED. THESE COSTS, SOMETIMES REFERRED TO AS LIFTING COSTS, INCLUDE

SUCH ITEMS AS LABOR COSTS TO OPERATE THE WELLS AND RELATED EQUIPMENT; REPAIR

AND MAINTENANCE COSTS ON THE WELLS AND EQUIPMENT; MATERIALS, SUPPLIES AND

ENERGY COSTS REQUIRED TO OPERATE THE WELLS AND RELATED EQUIPMENT; AND

ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES RELATED TO THE PRODUCTION ACTIVITY.

PROVED OIL AND GAS PROPERTIES HELD AND USED BY THE

CORPORATION ARE REVIEWED FOR IMPAIRMENT WHENEVER EVENTS OR CHANGES IN

CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THAT THE CARRYING AMOUNTS MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE. ASSETS

ARE GROUPED AT THE LOWEST LEVEL FOR WHICH THERE ARE IDENTIFIABLE CASH FLOWS

THAT ARE LARGELY INDEPENDENT OF THE CASH FLOWS OF OTHER GROUPS OF ASSETS.

THE CORPORATION ESTIMATES THE FUTURE UNDISCOUNTED CASH

FLOWS OF THE AFFECTED PROPERTIES TO JUDGE THE RECOVERABILITY OF CARRYING

AMOUNTS. CASH FLOWS USED IN IMPAIRMENT EVALUATIONS ARE DEVELOPED USING ANNUALLY

UPDATED CORPORATE PLAN INVESTMENT EVALUATION ASSUMPTIONS FOR CRUDE OIL

COMMODITY PRICES, REFINING AND CHEMICAL MARGINS AND FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE

RATES. ANNUAL VOLUMES ARE BASED ON FIELD PRODUCTION PROFILES, WHICH ARE ALSO

UPDATED ANNUALLY. PRICES FOR NATURAL GAS AND OTHER PRODUCTS ARE BASED ON

CORPORATE PLAN ASSUMPTIONS DEVELOPED ANNUALLY BY MAJOR REGION AND ALSO FOR

INVESTMENT EVALUATION PURPOSES. CASH FLOW ESTIMATES FOR IMPAIRMENT TESTING

EXCLUDE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS.

IMPAIRMENT ANALYSES ARE GENERALLY BASED ON PROVED

RESERVES. WHERE PROBABLE RESERVES EXIST, AN APPROPRIATELY RISK-ADJUSTED AMOUNT

OF THESE RESERVES MAY BE INCLUDED IN THE IMPAIRMENT EVALUATION. AN ASSET GROUP

WOULD BE IMPAIRED IF THE UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS WERE LESS THAN ITS CARRYING

VALUE.  IMPAIRMENTS ARE MEASURED BY THE AMOUNT THE CARRYING VALUE EXCEEDS FAIR

VALUE.

SIGNIFICANT UNPROVED PROPERTIES ARE ASSESSED FOR

IMPAIRMENT INDIVIDUALLY, AND VALUATION ALLOWANCES AGAINST THE CAPITALIZED COSTS

ARE RECORDED BASED ON THE ESTIMATED ECONOMIC CHANCE OF SUCCESS AND THE LENGTH

OF TIME THAT THE CORPORATION EXPECTS TO HOLD THE PROPERTIES. PROPERTIES THAT

ARE NOT INDIVIDUALLY SIGNIFICANT ARE AGGREGATED BY GROUPS AND AMORTIZED BASED

ON DEVELOPMENT RISK AND AVERAGE HOLDING PERIOD. THE VALUATION ALLOWANCES ARE

REVIEWED AT LEAST ANNUALLY.

68

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

GAINS ON SALES OF PROVED

AND UNPROVED PROPERTIES ARE ONLY RECOGNIZED WHEN THERE IS NEITHER UNCERTAINTY

ABOUT THE RECOVERY OF COSTS APPLICABLE TO ANY INTEREST RETAINED NOR ANY

SUBSTANTIAL OBLIGATION FOR FUTURE PERFORMANCE BY THE CORPORATION.

LOSSES ON PROPERTIES SOLD ARE RECOGNIZED WHEN INCURRED

OR WHEN THE PROPERTIES ARE HELD FOR SALE AND THE FAIR VALUE OF THE PROPERTIES

IS LESS THAN THE CARRYING VALUE.

ASSET

RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS AND ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES.

THE CORPORATION INCURS RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS FOR

CERTAIN ASSETS. THE FAIR VALUES OF THESE OBLIGATIONS ARE RECORDED AS

LIABILITIES ON A DISCOUNTED BASIS, WHICH IS TYPICALLY AT THE TIME THE ASSETS

ARE INSTALLED. THE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THESE LIABILITIES ARE CAPITALIZED AS

PART OF THE RELATED ASSETS AND DEPRECIATED. OVER TIME, THE LIABILITIES ARE

ACCRETED FOR THE CHANGE IN THEIR PRESENT VALUE.

LIABILITIES FOR ENVIRONMENTAL COSTS ARE RECORDED WHEN

IT IS PROBABLE THAT OBLIGATIONS HAVE BEEN INCURRED AND THE AMOUNTS CAN BE

REASONABLY ESTIMATED. THESE LIABILITIES ARE NOT REDUCED BY POSSIBLE RECOVERIES

FROM THIRD PARTIES AND PROJECTED CASH EXPENDITURES ARE NOT DISCOUNTED.

FOREIGN

CURRENCY TRANSLATION.

THE CORPORATION

SELECTS THE FUNCTIONAL REPORTING CURRENCY FOR ITS INTERNATIONAL SUBSIDIARIES

BASED ON THE CURRENCY OF THE PRIMARY ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH EACH

SUBSIDIARY OPERATES.

DOWNSTREAM AND CHEMICAL OPERATIONS PRIMARILY USE THE

LOCAL CURRENCY. HOWEVER, THE U.S. DOLLAR IS USED IN COUNTRIES WITH A HISTORY OF

HIGH INFLATION (PRIMARILY IN LATIN AMERICA) AND SINGAPORE, WHICH PREDOMINANTLY

SELLS INTO THE U.S. DOLLAR EXPORT MARKET. UPSTREAM OPERATIONS WHICH ARE

RELATIVELY SELF-CONTAINED AND INTEGRATED WITHIN A PARTICULAR COUNTRY, SUCH AS

CANADA, THE UNITED KINGDOM, NORWAY AND CONTINENTAL EUROPE, USE THE LOCAL

CURRENCY. SOME UPSTREAM OPERATIONS, PRIMARILY IN ASIA AND AFRICA, USE THE U.S.

DOLLAR BECAUSE THEY PREDOMINANTLY SELL CRUDE AND NATURAL GAS PRODUCTION INTO

U.S. DOLLAR-DENOMINATED MARKETS.

FOR ALL OPERATIONS, GAINS OR LOSSES FROM REMEASURING

FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSACTIONS INTO THE FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY ARE INCLUDED IN

INCOME.

STOCK-BASED

PAYMENTS.

THE CORPORATION AWARDS

STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION TO EMPLOYEES IN THE FORM OF RESTRICTED STOCK AND

RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS. COMPENSATION EXPENSE IS MEASURED BY THE PRICE OF THE STOCK

AT THE DATE OF GRANT AND IS RECOGNIZED IN INCOME OVER THE REQUISITE SERVICE

PERIOD. SEE NOTE 15, INCENTIVE PROGRAM, FOR FURTHER DETAILS.

2. ACCOUNTING CHANGES

CORPORATION DID NOT ADOPT AUTHORITATIVE GUIDANCE IN 2013 THAT HAD A MATERIAL

IMPACT ON THE CORPORATION’S FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

INFORMATION

THE

CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS PROVIDES INFORMATION ABOUT CHANGES IN CASH

AND CASH EQUIVALENTS. HIGHLY LIQUID INVESTMENTS WITH MATURITIES OF THREE MONTHS

OR LESS WHEN ACQUIRED ARE CLASSIFIED AS CASH EQUIVALENTS.

THE “NET (GAIN) ON ASSET SALES” IN NET CASH PROVIDED

BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES ON THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS INCLUDES

BEFORE-TAX GAINS FROM THE SALE OF A PARTIAL INTEREST IN IRAQ, THE SALE OF

DOWNSTREAM AFFILIATES IN THE CARIBBEAN AND THE SALE OF SERVICE STATIONS IN

2013; THE JAPAN RESTRUCTURING, THE SALE OF AN UPSTREAM PROPERTY IN ANGOLA, EXCHANGES

OF UPSTREAM  PROPERTIES, THE SALE OF U.S. SERVICE STATIONS, AND THE SALE OF THE

DOWNSTREAM AFFILIATES IN MALAYSIA AND SWITZERLAND IN 2012; AND FROM THE SALE OF

SOME UPSTREAM CANADIAN, U.K. AND OTHER PRODUCING PROPERTIES AND ASSETS, AND THE

SALE OF U.S. SERVICE STATIONS IN 2011.  THESE GAINS ARE REPORTED IN “OTHER

INCOME” ON THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF INCOME.

IN 2012, THE CORPORATION’S INTEREST IN A COST COMPANY

WAS REDEEMED.  AS PART OF THE REDEMPTION, A VARIABLE NOTE DUE IN 2035 ISSUED BY

MOBIL SERVICES (BAHAMAS) LTD. WAS ASSIGNED TO A CONSOLIDATED EXXONMOBIL

AFFILIATE.  THIS NOTE IS NO LONGER CLASSIFIED AS THIRD PARTY LONG-TERM DEBT.

THIS ASSIGNMENT DID NOT RESULT IN A “REDUCTION IN LONG-TERM DEBT” ON THE

STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS.

IN 2012, EXXONMOBIL COMPLETED ASSET EXCHANGES,

PRIMARILY NONCASH TRANSACTIONS, OF APPROXIMATELY $1 BILLION.  THIS AMOUNT IS

NOT INCLUDED IN THE “SALES OF SUBSIDIARIES, INVESTMENTS, AND PROPERTY, PLANT

AND EQUIPMENT” OR THE “ADDITIONS TO PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT” LINES ON THE

STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS.

IN 2011, INCLUDED IN “PROCEEDS ASSOCIATED WITH SALES

OF SUBSIDIARIES, PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT, AND SALES AND RETURNS OF

INVESTMENTS” IS A $3.6 BILLION DEPOSIT FOR AN ASSET THAT WAS SOLD IN 2012.

7. EQUITY COMPANY

INFORMATION

THE

SUMMARIZED FINANCIAL INFORMATION BELOW INCLUDES AMOUNTS RELATED TO CERTAIN

LESS-THAN-MAJORITY-OWNED COMPANIES AND MAJORITY-OWNED SUBSIDIARIES WHERE

MINORITY SHAREHOLDERS POSSESS THE RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN SIGNIFICANT

MANAGEMENT DECISIONS (SEE NOTE 1).  THESE COMPANIES ARE PRIMARILY ENGAGED IN

OIL AND GAS EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION, NATURAL GAS MARKETING AND REFINING

OPERATIONS IN NORTH AMERICA; NATURAL GAS EXPLORATION, PRODUCTION AND

DISTRIBUTION, AND DOWNSTREAM OPERATIONS IN EUROPE; AND RESEARCH, EXPLORATION,

PRODUCTION, LIQUEFIED NATURAL GAS (LNG) OPERATIONS, REFINING OPERATIONS,

PETROCHEMICAL MANUFACTURING, FUEL SALES AND POWER GENERATION IN ASIA. ALSO

INCLUDED ARE SEVERAL REFINING, PETROCHEMICAL MANUFACTURING AND MARKETING

VENTURES.

THE CORPORATION’S OWNERSHIP IN THESE VENTURES IS

IN THE FORM OF SHARES IN CORPORATE JOINT VENTURES AS WELL AS INTERESTS IN

PARTNERSHIPS. DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE COMPANY’S CARRYING VALUE OF AN EQUITY

INVESTMENT AND ITS UNDERLYING EQUITY IN THE NET ASSETS OF THE AFFILIATE ARE

ASSIGNED TO THE EXTENT PRACTICABLE TO SPECIFIC ASSETS AND LIABILITIES BASED ON

THE COMPANY’S ANALYSIS OF THE FACTORS GIVING RISE TO THE DIFFERENCE.  THE

AMORTIZATION OF THIS DIFFERENCE, AS APPROPRIATE, IS INCLUDED IN “INCOME FROM

EQUITY AFFILIATES.”

THE SHARE OF TOTAL EQUITY COMPANY REVENUES FROM

SALES TO EXXONMOBIL CONSOLIDATED COMPANIES WAS 13 PERCENT, 16 PERCENT AND 19

PERCENT IN THE YEARS 2013, 2012 AND 2011, RESPECTIVELY.

IN 2013, THE CORPORATION AND ROSNEFT ESTABLISHED

VARIOUS ENTITIES TO CONDUCT EXPLORATION AND RESEARCH ACTIVITIES.  PERIODS OF

DISPROPORTIONATE FUNDING WILL RESULT IN THE CORPORATION RECOGNIZING, DURING THE

EARLY PHASES OF THE PROJECTS, AN INVESTMENT THAT IS LARGER THAN ITS EQUITY

SHARE OF THESE ENTITIES.  THESE JOINT VENTURES ARE CONSIDERED VARIABLE INTEREST

ENTITIES (VIES).  HOWEVER, SINCE THE CORPORATION IS NOT THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY

OF THESE ENTITIES THE JOINT VENTURES ARE REPORTED AS EQUITY COMPANIES.  THE

CORPORATION’S MAXIMUM EXPOSURE TO LOSS FROM THESE JOINT VENTURES IS LIMITED TO

ITS INVESTMENT OF $0.1 BILLION AND FIRM COMMITMENTS OF $1.1 BILLION AT DECEMBER

31, 2013.

ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS

THE

CORPORATION INCURS RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS FOR CERTAIN ASSETS. THE FAIR VALUES

OF THESE OBLIGATIONS ARE RECORDED AS LIABILITIES ON A DISCOUNTED BASIS, WHICH

IS TYPICALLY AT THE TIME THE ASSETS ARE INSTALLED. IN THE ESTIMATION OF FAIR

VALUE, THE CORPORATION USES ASSUMPTIONS AND JUDGMENTS REGARDING SUCH FACTORS AS

THE EXISTENCE OF A LEGAL OBLIGATION FOR AN ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATION;

TECHNICAL ASSESSMENTS OF THE ASSETS; ESTIMATED AMOUNTS AND TIMING OF

SETTLEMENTS; DISCOUNT RATES; AND INFLATION RATES. ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS

INCURRED IN THE CURRENT PERIOD WERE LEVEL 3 (UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS) FAIR VALUE

MEASUREMENTS. THE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THESE LIABILITIES ARE CAPITALIZED AS

PART OF THE RELATED ASSETS AND DEPRECIATED AS THE RESERVES ARE PRODUCED. OVER

TIME, THE LIABILITIES ARE ACCRETED FOR THE CHANGE IN THEIR PRESENT VALUE.

ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS FOR DOWNSTREAM AND

CHEMICAL FACILITIES GENERALLY BECOME FIRM AT THE TIME THE FACILITIES ARE

PERMANENTLY SHUT DOWN AND DISMANTLED. THESE OBLIGATIONS MAY INCLUDE THE COSTS

OF ASSET DISPOSAL AND ADDITIONAL SOIL REMEDIATION. HOWEVER, THESE SITES HAVE

INDETERMINATE LIVES BASED ON PLANS FOR CONTINUED OPERATIONS AND AS SUCH, THE

FAIR VALUE OF THE CONDITIONAL LEGAL OBLIGATIONS CANNOT BE MEASURED, SINCE IT IS

IMPOSSIBLE TO ESTIMATE THE FUTURE SETTLEMENT DATES OF SUCH OBLIGATIONS.

INSTRUMENTS AND DERIVATIVES

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS.

THE FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS IS DETERMINED

BY REFERENCE TO OBSERVABLE MARKET DATA AND OTHER VALUATION TECHNIQUES AS

APPROPRIATE. THE ONLY CATEGORY OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WHERE THE DIFFERENCE

BETWEEN FAIR VALUE AND RECORDED BOOK VALUE IS NOTABLE IS LONG-TERM DEBT. THE

ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF TOTAL LONG-TERM DEBT, EXCLUDING CAPITALIZED LEASE

OBLIGATIONS, WAS $6.8 BILLION AND $8.0 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2013, AND 2012,

RESPECTIVELY, AS COMPARED TO RECORDED BOOK VALUES OF $6.5 BILLION AND $7.5 BILLION

AT DECEMBER 31, 2013, AND 2012, RESPECTIVELY.

THE FAIR VALUE OF LONG-TERM DEBT BY

HIERARCHY LEVEL AT DECEMBER 31, 2013, IS: LEVEL 1 $5,756 MILLION; LEVEL 2 $967

MILLION; AND LEVEL 3 $64 MILLION.  LEVEL 1 REPRESENTS QUOTED PRICES IN ACTIVE

MARKETS.  LEVEL 2 INCLUDES DEBT WHOSE FAIR VALUE IS BASED UPON A PUBLICLY

MARKET INDICATORS IF AVAILABLE.

DERIVATIVE

INSTRUMENTS.

THE CORPORATION’S SIZE,

STRONG CAPITAL STRUCTURE, GEOGRAPHIC DIVERSITY AND THE COMPLEMENTARY NATURE OF

THE UPSTREAM, DOWNSTREAM AND CHEMICAL BUSINESSES REDUCE THE CORPORATION’S

ENTERPRISE-WIDE RISK FROM CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES, CURRENCY RATES AND COMMODITY

PRICES. AS A RESULT, THE CORPORATION MAKES LIMITED USE OF DERIVATIVES TO

MITIGATE THE IMPACT OF SUCH CHANGES. THE CORPORATION DOES NOT ENGAGE IN

SPECULATIVE DERIVATIVE ACTIVITIES OR DERIVATIVE TRADING ACTIVITIES NOR DOES IT

USE DERIVATIVES WITH LEVERAGED FEATURES. WHEN THE CORPORATION DOES ENTER INTO

DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS, IT IS TO OFFSET EXPOSURES ASSOCIATED WITH INTEREST

RATES, FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES AND HYDROCARBON PRICES THAT ARISE FROM

EXISTING ASSETS, LIABILITIES AND FORECASTED TRANSACTIONS.

THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS

OUTSTANDING AND RECORDED ON THE BALANCE SHEET WAS A NET ASSET OF $1 MILLION AT

YEAR-END 2013 AND A NET ASSET OF $2 MILLION AT YEAR-END 2012. ASSETS AND

LIABILITIES ASSOCIATED WITH DERIVATIVES ARE USUALLY RECORDED EITHER IN “OTHER

CURRENT ASSETS” OR “ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND ACCRUED LIABILITIES.”

THE CORPORATION’S FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT OF ITS

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS USE EITHER LEVEL 1 (OBSERVABLE QUOTED PRICES ON ACTIVE

EXCHANGES) OR LEVEL 2 (DERIVATIVES THAT ARE DETERMINED BY EITHER MARKET PRICES

ON AN ACTIVE MARKET FOR SIMILAR ASSETS OR BY PRICES QUOTED BY A BROKER OR OTHER

MARKET-CORROBORATED PRICES) INPUTS.

THE CORPORATION RECOGNIZED A BEFORE-TAX GAIN OR (LOSS)

RELATED TO DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS OF $(7) MILLION, $(23) MILLION AND $131 MILLION

DURING 2013, 2012 AND 2011, RESPECTIVELY. INCOME STATEMENT EFFECTS ASSOCIATED

WITH DERIVATIVES ARE USUALLY RECORDED EITHER IN “SALES AND OTHER OPERATING

REVENUE” OR “CRUDE OIL AND PRODUCT PURCHASES.”

THE CORPORATION BELIEVES THERE ARE NO MATERIAL MARKET

OR CREDIT RISKS TO THE CORPORATION’S FINANCIAL POSITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

OR LIQUIDITY AS A RESULT OF THE DERIVATIVE ACTIVITIES DESCRIBED ABOVE.

15. INCENTIVE PROGRAM

THE 2003 INCENTIVE PROGRAM PROVIDES FOR GRANTS OF

STOCK OPTIONS, STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS (SARS), RESTRICTED STOCK AND OTHER

FORMS OF AWARD. AWARDS MAY BE GRANTED TO ELIGIBLE EMPLOYEES OF THE CORPORATION

AND THOSE AFFILIATES AT LEAST 50 PERCENT OWNED. OUTSTANDING AWARDS ARE SUBJECT

TO CERTAIN FORFEITURE PROVISIONS CONTAINED IN THE PROGRAM OR AWARD INSTRUMENT.

OPTIONS AND SARS MAY BE GRANTED AT PRICES NOT LESS THAN 100 PERCENT OF MARKET

VALUE ON THE DATE OF GRANT AND HAVE A MAXIMUM LIFE OF 10 YEARS. THE MAXIMUM

NUMBER OF SHARES OF STOCK THAT MAY BE ISSUED UNDER THE 2003 INCENTIVE PROGRAM

IS 220 MILLION. AWARDS THAT ARE FORFEITED, EXPIRE OR ARE SETTLED IN CASH, DO

NOT COUNT AGAINST THIS MAXIMUM LIMIT. THE 2003 INCENTIVE PROGRAM DOES NOT HAVE

A SPECIFIED TERM. NEW AWARDS MAY BE MADE UNTIL THE AVAILABLE SHARES ARE

DEPLETED, UNLESS THE BOARD TERMINATES THE PLAN EARLY. AT THE END OF 2013,

REMAINING SHARES AVAILABLE FOR AWARD UNDER THE 2003 INCENTIVE PROGRAM WERE 117

MILLION.

AWARDS

TOTALING 9,729 THOUSAND, 10,017 THOUSAND, AND 10,533 THOUSAND OF

RESTRICTED (NONVESTED) COMMON STOCK AND RESTRICTED (NONVESTED) COMMON STOCK

UNITS WERE GRANTED IN 2013, 2012 AND 2011, RESPECTIVELY. COMPENSATION EXPENSE

FOR THESE AWARDS IS BASED ON THE PRICE OF THE STOCK AT THE DATE OF GRANT AND IS

RECOGNIZED IN INCOME OVER THE REQUISITE SERVICE PERIOD. SHARES FOR THESE AWARDS

ARE ISSUED TO EMPLOYEES FROM TREASURY STOCK. THE UNITS THAT ARE SETTLED IN CASH

ARE RECORDED AS LIABILITIES AND THEIR CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE ARE RECOGNIZED OVER

THE VESTING PERIOD. DURING THE APPLICABLE RESTRICTED PERIODS, THE SHARES AND

UNITS MAY NOT BE SOLD OR TRANSFERRED AND ARE SUBJECT TO FORFEITURE. THE

MAJORITY OF THE AWARDS HAVE GRADED VESTING PERIODS, WITH 50 PERCENT OF THE

SHARES AND UNITS IN EACH AWARD VESTING AFTER THREE YEARS AND THE REMAINING 50

PERCENT VESTING AFTER SEVEN YEARS. AWARDS GRANTED TO A SMALL NUMBER OF SENIOR

EXECUTIVES HAVE VESTING PERIODS OF FIVE YEARS FOR 50 PERCENT OF THE AWARD AND

OF 10 YEARS OR RETIREMENT, WHICHEVER OCCURS LATER, FOR THE REMAINING 50 PERCENT

OF THE AWARD.

THE CORPORATION HAS PURCHASED SHARES IN THE OPEN

MARKET AND THROUGH NEGOTIATED TRANSACTIONS TO OFFSET SHARES ISSUED IN

CONJUNCTION WITH BENEFIT PLANS AND PROGRAMS. PURCHASES MAY BE DISCONTINUED AT

16. LITIGATION AND

OTHER CONTINGENCIES

LITIGATION.

A VARIETY OF CLAIMS HAVE BEEN MADE

AGAINST EXXONMOBIL AND CERTAIN OF ITS CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES IN A NUMBER OF

PENDING LAWSUITS. MANAGEMENT HAS REGULAR LITIGATION REVIEWS, INCLUDING UPDATES

FROM CORPORATE AND OUTSIDE COUNSEL, TO ASSESS THE NEED FOR ACCOUNTING

RECOGNITION OR DISCLOSURE OF THESE CONTINGENCIES. THE CORPORATION ACCRUES AN

UNDISCOUNTED LIABILITY FOR THOSE CONTINGENCIES WHERE THE INCURRENCE OF A LOSS

IS PROBABLE AND THE AMOUNT CAN BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED. IF A RANGE OF AMOUNTS

CAN BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED AND NO AMOUNT WITHIN THE RANGE IS A BETTER ESTIMATE

THAN ANY OTHER AMOUNT, THEN THE MINIMUM OF THE RANGE IS ACCRUED. THE

CORPORATION DOES NOT RECORD LIABILITIES WHEN THE LIKELIHOOD THAT THE LIABILITY

HAS BEEN INCURRED IS PROBABLE BUT THE AMOUNT CANNOT BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED OR

WHEN THE LIABILITY IS BELIEVED TO BE ONLY REASONABLY POSSIBLE OR REMOTE. FOR

CONTINGENCIES WHERE AN UNFAVORABLE OUTCOME IS REASONABLY POSSIBLE AND WHICH ARE

SIGNIFICANT, THE CORPORATION DISCLOSES THE NATURE OF THE CONTINGENCY AND, WHERE

FEASIBLE, AN ESTIMATE OF THE POSSIBLE LOSS. FOR PURPOSES OF OUR CONTINGENCY

DISCLOSURES, “SIGNIFICANT” INCLUDES MATERIAL MATTERS AS WELL AS OTHER MATTERS

WHICH MANAGEMENT BELIEVES SHOULD BE DISCLOSED. EXXONMOBIL WILL CONTINUE TO

DEFEND ITSELF VIGOROUSLY IN THESE MATTERS. BASED ON A CONSIDERATION OF ALL

RELEVANT FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES, THE CORPORATION DOES NOT BELIEVE THE ULTIMATE

OUTCOME OF ANY CURRENTLY PENDING LAWSUIT AGAINST EXXONMOBIL WILL HAVE A

MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT UPON THE CORPORATION’S OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL CONDITION,

OR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS TAKEN AS A WHOLE.

OTHER

CONTINGENCIES.

THE CORPORATION AND

CERTAIN OF ITS CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES WERE CONTINGENTLY LIABLE AT DECEMBER

31, 2013, FOR GUARANTEES RELATING TO NOTES, LOANS AND PERFORMANCE UNDER

CONTRACTS. WHERE GUARANTEES FOR ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION AND OTHER SIMILAR

MATTERS DO NOT INCLUDE A STATED CAP, THE AMOUNTS REFLECT MANAGEMENT’S ESTIMATE

OF THE MAXIMUM POTENTIAL EXPOSURE.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

IN

ACCORDANCE WITH A NATIONALIZATION DECREE ISSUED BY VENEZUELA’S PRESIDENT IN

FEBRUARY 2007, BY MAY 1, 2007, A SUBSIDIARY OF THE VENEZUELAN NATIONAL OIL

COMPANY (PDVSA) ASSUMED THE OPERATORSHIP OF THE CERRO NEGRO HEAVY OIL PROJECT.

THIS PROJECT HAD BEEN OPERATED AND OWNED BY EXXONMOBIL AFFILIATES HOLDING A

41.67 PERCENT OWNERSHIP INTEREST IN THE PROJECT. THE DECREE ALSO REQUIRED

CONVERSION OF THE CERRO NEGRO PROJECT INTO A “MIXED ENTERPRISE” AND AN INCREASE

IN PDVSA’S OR ONE OF ITS AFFILIATE’S OWNERSHIP INTEREST IN THE PROJECT, WITH

THE STIPULATION THAT IF EXXONMOBIL REFUSED TO ACCEPT THE TERMS FOR THE FORMATION

OF THE MIXED ENTERPRISE WITHIN A SPECIFIED PERIOD OF TIME, THE GOVERNMENT WOULD

“DIRECTLY ASSUME THE ACTIVITIES” CARRIED OUT BY THE JOINT VENTURE. EXXONMOBIL

REFUSED TO ACCEDE TO THE TERMS PROFFERED BY THE GOVERNMENT, AND ON JUNE 27,

2007, THE GOVERNMENT EXPROPRIATED EXXONMOBIL’S 41.67 PERCENT INTEREST IN THE

CERRO NEGRO PROJECT. EXXONMOBIL’S REMAINING NET BOOK INVESTMENT IN CERRO NEGRO

PRODUCING ASSETS IS ABOUT $750 MILLION.

ON SEPTEMBER 6, 2007, AFFILIATES OF EXXONMOBIL FILED A

REQUEST FOR ARBITRATION WITH THE INTERNATIONAL CENTRE FOR SETTLEMENT OF

INVESTMENT DISPUTES (ICSID) INVOKING ICSID JURISDICTION UNDER VENEZUELA’S

INVESTMENT LAW AND THE NETHERLANDS-VENEZUELA BILATERAL INVESTMENT TREATY. THE

ICSID TRIBUNAL ISSUED A DECISION ON JUNE 10, 2010, FINDING THAT IT HAD

JURISDICTION TO PROCEED ON THE BASIS OF THE NETHERLANDS-VENEZUELA BILATERAL

INVESTMENT TREATY. THE ICSID ARBITRATION PROCEEDING IS CONTINUING AND A HEARING

ON THE MERITS WAS HELD IN FEBRUARY 2012. AT THIS TIME, THE NET IMPACT OF THESE

MATTERS ON THE CORPORATION’S CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL RESULTS CANNOT BE

REASONABLY ESTIMATED. REGARDLESS, THE CORPORATION DOES NOT EXPECT THE

RESOLUTION TO HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT UPON THE CORPORATION’S OPERATIONS OR

FINANCIAL CONDITION.

AN AFFILIATE OF EXXONMOBIL IS ONE OF THE CONTRACTORS

UNDER A PRODUCTION SHARING CONTRACT (PSC) WITH THE NIGERIAN NATIONAL PETROLEUM

CORPORATION (NNPC) COVERING THE ERHA BLOCK LOCATED IN THE OFFSHORE WATERS OF

NIGERIA. EXXONMOBIL’S AFFILIATE IS THE OPERATOR OF THE BLOCK AND OWNS A

56.25 PERCENT INTEREST UNDER THE PSC. THE CONTRACTORS ARE IN DISPUTE WITH

NNPC REGARDING NNPC’S LIFTING OF CRUDE OIL IN EXCESS OF ITS ENTITLEMENT UNDER

THE TERMS OF THE PSC. IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE TERMS OF THE PSC, THE

CONTRACTORS INITIATED ARBITRATION IN ABUJA, NIGERIA, UNDER THE NIGERIAN

ARBITRATION AND CONCILIATION ACT. ON OCTOBER 24, 2011, A THREE-MEMBER

ARBITRAL TRIBUNAL ISSUED AN AWARD UPHOLDING THE CONTRACTORS’ POSITION IN ALL

MATERIAL RESPECTS AND AWARDING DAMAGES TO THE CONTRACTORS JOINTLY IN AN AMOUNT

OF APPROXIMATELY $1.8 BILLION PLUS $234 MILLION IN ACCRUED INTEREST. THE

CONTRACTORS PETITIONED A NIGERIAN FEDERAL COURT FOR ENFORCEMENT OF THE AWARD,

AND NNPC PETITIONED THE SAME COURT TO HAVE THE AWARD SET ASIDE.

ON MAY 22, 2012, THE COURT SET ASIDE THE

AWARD.  THE CONTRACTORS HAVE APPEALED THAT JUDGMENT.

IN JUNE 2013, THE CONTRACTORS FILED A LAWSUIT

AGAINST NNPC IN THE NIGERIAN FEDERAL HIGH COURT IN ORDER TO PRESERVE THEIR

ABILITY TO SEEK ENFORCEMENT OF THE PSC IN THE COURTS IF NECESSARY. AT THIS TIME,

THE NET IMPACT OF THIS MATTER ON THE CORPORATION’S CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

RESULTS CANNOT BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED. HOWEVER, REGARDLESS OF THE OUTCOME

OF ENFORCEMENT PROCEEDINGS, THE CORPORATION DOES NOT EXPECT THE PROCEEDINGS TO

HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT UPON THE CORPORATION’S OPERATIONS OR FINANCIAL

CONDITION.

FOR

SELECTION OF THE DISCOUNT RATE FOR U.S. PLANS, SEVERAL SOURCES OF INFORMATION

ARE CONSIDERED, INCLUDING INTEREST RATE MARKET INDICATORS AND THE DISCOUNT RATE

DETERMINED BY CONSTRUCTING A PORTFOLIO OF HIGH-QUALITY, NONCALLABLE BONDS WITH

CASH FLOWS THAT MATCH ESTIMATED OUTFLOWS FOR BENEFIT PAYMENTS.  FOR MAJOR

NON-U.S. PLANS, THE DISCOUNT RATE IS DETERMINED BY USING BOND PORTFOLIOS

WITH AN AVERAGE MATURITY APPROXIMATING THAT OF THE LIABILITIES OR SPOT YIELD

CURVES, BOTH OF WHICH ARE CONSTRUCTED USING HIGH-QUALITY,

LOCAL-CURRENCY-DENOMINATED BONDS.

THE MEASUREMENT OF THE ACCUMULATED

POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATION ASSUMES A HEALTH CARE COST TREND RATE OF 4.5

PERCENT IN 2015 AND SUBSEQUENT YEARS. A ONE-PERCENTAGE-POINT INCREASE IN

THE HEALTH CARE COST TREND RATE WOULD INCREASE SERVICE AND INTEREST COST

BY $68 MILLION AND THE POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATION BY $734 MILLION. A

ONE-PERCENTAGE-POINT DECREASE IN THE HEALTH CARE COST TREND RATE WOULD DECREASE

SERVICE AND INTEREST COST BY $53 MILLION AND THE POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT

OBLIGATION BY $597 MILLION.

EXPECTED REAL RETURN FOR THE SPECIFIC ASSET CLASS AND INFLATION. A SINGLE,

LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN IS THEN CALCULATED AS THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE OF THE

TARGET ASSET ALLOCATION PERCENTAGES AND THE LONG-TERM RETURN ASSUMPTION FOR

EACH ASSET CLASS.

THE

CORPORATION’S INVESTMENT STRATEGY FOR BENEFIT PLAN ASSETS REFLECTS

A LONG-TERM VIEW, A CAREFUL ASSESSMENT OF THE RISKS INHERENT IN VARIOUS

ASSET CLASSES AND BROAD DIVERSIFICATION TO REDUCE THE RISK OF THE PORTFOLIO.

THE BENEFIT PLAN ASSETS ARE PRIMARILY INVESTED IN PASSIVE EQUITY AND

FIXED INCOME INDEX FUNDS TO DIVERSIFY RISK WHILE MINIMIZING COSTS. THE

EQUITY FUNDS HOLD EXXONMOBIL STOCK ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO REPLICATE

THE RELEVANT EQUITY INDEX. THE FIXED INCOME FUNDS ARE LARGELY INVESTED IN HIGH-QUALITY

CORPORATE AND GOVERNMENT DEBT SECURITIES.

STUDIES ARE PERIODICALLY CONDUCTED TO ESTABLISH THE

PREFERRED TARGET ASSET ALLOCATION PERCENTAGES. THE TARGET ASSET ALLOCATION FOR

THE U.S. BENEFIT PLANS IS 50 PERCENT EQUITY SECURITIES AND 50 PERCENT DEBT

SECURITIES. THE TARGET ASSET ALLOCATION FOR THE NON-U.S. PLANS IN AGGREGATE IS 49

PERCENT EQUITY SECURITIES AND 51 PERCENT DEBT SECURITIES. THE EQUITY TARGETS

FOR THE U.S. AND NON-U.S. PLANS INCLUDE AN ALLOCATION TO PRIVATE EQUITY

PARTNERSHIPS THAT PRIMARILY FOCUS ON EARLY-STAGE VENTURE CAPITAL OF 5 PERCENT

AND 3 PERCENT, RESPECTIVELY.

THE FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT LEVELS ARE ACCOUNTING TERMS

THAT REFER TO DIFFERENT METHODS OF VALUING ASSETS. THE TERMS DO NOT REPRESENT

THE RELATIVE RISK OR CREDIT QUALITY OF AN INVESTMENT.

DISCLOSURES ABOUT SEGMENTS AND RELATED INFORMATION

THE

UPSTREAM, DOWNSTREAM AND CHEMICAL FUNCTIONS BEST DEFINE THE OPERATING SEGMENTS

OF THE BUSINESS THAT ARE REPORTED SEPARATELY. THE FACTORS USED TO IDENTIFY

THESE REPORTABLE SEGMENTS ARE BASED ON THE NATURE OF THE OPERATIONS THAT ARE

UNDERTAKEN BY EACH SEGMENT. THE UPSTREAM SEGMENT IS ORGANIZED AND OPERATES TO

EXPLORE FOR AND PRODUCE CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS. THE DOWNSTREAM SEGMENT IS

ORGANIZED AND OPERATES TO MANUFACTURE AND SELL PETROLEUM PRODUCTS. THE CHEMICAL

SEGMENT IS ORGANIZED AND OPERATES TO MANUFACTURE AND SELL PETROCHEMICALS. THESE

SEGMENTS ARE BROADLY UNDERSTOOD ACROSS THE PETROLEUM AND PETROCHEMICAL

INDUSTRIES.

THESE FUNCTIONS HAVE BEEN DEFINED AS THE OPERATING

SEGMENTS OF THE CORPORATION BECAUSE THEY ARE THE SEGMENTS (1) THAT ENGAGE

IN BUSINESS ACTIVITIES FROM WHICH REVENUES ARE EARNED AND EXPENSES ARE

INCURRED; (2) WHOSE OPERATING RESULTS ARE REGULARLY REVIEWED BY THE

CORPORATION’S CHIEF OPERATING DECISION MAKER TO MAKE DECISIONS ABOUT RESOURCES

TO BE ALLOCATED TO THE SEGMENT AND ASSESS ITS PERFORMANCE; AND (3) FOR

WHICH DISCRETE FINANCIAL INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE.

EARNINGS AFTER INCOME TAX INCLUDE TRANSFERS AT

ESTIMATED MARKET PRICES.

91

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

IN CORPORATE AND FINANCING

ACTIVITIES, INTEREST REVENUE RELATES TO INTEREST EARNED ON CASH DEPOSITS AND

MARKETABLE SECURITIES. INTEREST EXPENSE INCLUDES NON-DEBT-RELATED INTEREST

EXPENSE OF $202 MILLION AND $165 MILLION IN 2012 AND 2011, RESPECTIVELY. FOR

2013, NON-DEBT-RELATED INTEREST EXPENSE WAS A NET CREDIT OF $123 MILLION,

PRIMARILY REFLECTING THE EFFECT OF CREDITS FROM THE FAVORABLE RESOLUTION OF

PRIOR YEAR TAX POSITIONS.

ON REMITTANCE OF THESE FUNDS ARE NOT EXPECTED TO BE MATERIAL.

95

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS.

THE CORPORATION IS SUBJECT TO INCOME TAXATION IN MANY

JURISDICTIONS AROUND THE WORLD. UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS REFLECT THE

DIFFERENCE BETWEEN POSITIONS TAKEN OR EXPECTED TO BE TAKEN ON INCOME TAX

RETURNS AND THE AMOUNTS RECOGNIZED IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. RESOLUTION OF

THE RELATED TAX POSITIONS THROUGH NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE RELEVANT TAX

AUTHORITIES OR THROUGH LITIGATION WILL TAKE MANY YEARS TO COMPLETE. IT IS

DIFFICULT TO PREDICT THE TIMING OF RESOLUTION FOR TAX POSITIONS SINCE SUCH

TIMING IS NOT ENTIRELY WITHIN THE CONTROL OF THE CORPORATION. IT IS REASONABLY

POSSIBLE THAT THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS COULD INCREASE BY UP

TO 20 PERCENT IN THE NEXT 12 MONTHS, WITH NO MATERIAL IMPACT ON NEAR-TERM

EARNINGS. GIVEN THE LONG TIME PERIODS INVOLVED IN RESOLVING TAX POSITIONS, THE

CORPORATION DOES NOT EXPECT THAT THE RECOGNITION OF UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS

WILL HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE CORPORATION’S EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE IN

ANY GIVEN YEAR.

OIL AND GAS EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION COSTS

THE AMOUNTS SHOWN FOR NET CAPITALIZED COSTS OF

CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES ARE $13,667 MILLION LESS AT YEAR-END 2013 AND $10,643

MILLION LESS AT YEAR-END 2012 THAN THE AMOUNTS REPORTED AS INVESTMENTS IN

PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT FOR THE UPSTREAM IN NOTE 9. THIS IS DUE

TO THE EXCLUSION FROM CAPITALIZED COSTS OF CERTAIN TRANSPORTATION AND

RESEARCH ASSETS AND ASSETS RELATING TO LNG OPERATIONS. ASSETS RELATED TO OIL

SANDS AND OIL SHALE MINING OPERATIONS ARE INCLUDED IN THE CAPITALIZED COSTS IN

ACCORDANCE WITH FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD RULES.

OIL AND GAS RESERVES

THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION DESCRIBES CHANGES DURING THE

YEARS AND BALANCES OF PROVED OIL AND GAS RESERVES AT YEAR-END 2011, 2012, AND

2013.

THE DEFINITIONS USED ARE IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION’S RULE 4-10 (A) OF REGULATION S-X.

PROVED OIL AND GAS RESERVES ARE THOSE QUANTITIES OF

OIL AND GAS, WHICH, BY ANALYSIS OF GEOSCIENCE AND ENGINEERING DATA, CAN BE

ESTIMATED WITH REASONABLE CERTAINTY TO BE ECONOMICALLY PRODUCIBLE – FROM A

GIVEN DATE FORWARD, FROM KNOWN RESERVOIRS, AND UNDER EXISTING ECONOMIC

CONDITIONS, OPERATING METHODS AND GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS – PRIOR TO THE TIME AT

WHICH CONTRACTS PROVIDING THE RIGHT TO OPERATE EXPIRE, UNLESS EVIDENCE

INDICATES THAT RENEWAL IS REASONABLY CERTAIN. IN SOME CASES, SUBSTANTIAL NEW

INVESTMENTS IN ADDITIONAL WELLS AND RELATED FACILITIES WILL BE REQUIRED TO

RECOVER THESE PROVED RESERVES.

IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE

COMMISSION’S RULES, THE YEAR-END RESERVES VOLUMES AS WELL AS THE RESERVES

CHANGE CATEGORIES SHOWN IN THE FOLLOWING TABLES WERE CALCULATED USING AVERAGE

PRICES DURING THE 12-MONTH PERIOD PRIOR TO THE ENDING DATE OF THE PERIOD

COVERED BY THE REPORT, DETERMINED AS AN UNWEIGHTED ARITHMETIC AVERAGE OF THE

FIRST-DAY-OF-THE-MONTH PRICE FOR EACH MONTH WITHIN SUCH PERIOD. THESE RESERVES

QUANTITIES ARE ALSO USED IN CALCULATING UNIT-OF-PRODUCTION DEPRECIATION RATES

AND IN CALCULATING THE STANDARDIZED MEASURE OF DISCOUNTED NET CASH FLOW.

REVISIONS CAN INCLUDE UPWARD OR DOWNWARD CHANGES IN

PREVIOUSLY ESTIMATED VOLUMES OF PROVED RESERVES FOR EXISTING FIELDS DUE TO THE

EVALUATION OR RE-EVALUATION OF (1) ALREADY AVAILABLE GEOLOGIC, RESERVOIR

OR PRODUCTION DATA, (2) NEW GEOLOGIC, RESERVOIR OR PRODUCTION DATA OR

(3) CHANGES IN AVERAGE PRICES AND YEAR-END COSTS THAT ARE USED IN THE ESTIMATION

OF RESERVES. THIS CATEGORY CAN ALSO INCLUDE SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN EITHER

DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY OR PRODUCTION EQUIPMENT/FACILITY CAPACITY.

PROVED RESERVES INCLUDE 100 PERCENT OF EACH

MAJORITY-OWNED AFFILIATE’S PARTICIPATION IN PROVED RESERVES AND EXXONMOBIL’S

OWNERSHIP PERCENTAGE OF THE PROVED RESERVES OF EQUITY COMPANIES, BUT EXCLUDE

ROYALTIES AND QUANTITIES DUE OTHERS. GAS RESERVES EXCLUDE THE GASEOUS

EQUIVALENT OF LIQUIDS EXPECTED TO BE REMOVED FROM THE GAS ON LEASES, AT FIELD

FACILITIES AND AT GAS PROCESSING PLANTS. THESE LIQUIDS ARE INCLUDED IN NET

PROVED RESERVES OF CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS LIQUIDS.

IN THE PROVED RESERVES TABLES, CONSOLIDATED RESERVES

AND EQUITY COMPANY RESERVES ARE REPORTED SEPARATELY. HOWEVER, THE CORPORATION

DOES NOT VIEW EQUITY COMPANY RESERVES ANY DIFFERENTLY THAN THOSE FROM

CONSOLIDATED COMPANIES.

RESERVES REPORTED UNDER PRODUCTION SHARING AND OTHER

NONCONCESSIONARY AGREEMENTS ARE BASED ON THE ECONOMIC INTEREST AS DEFINED BY

THE SPECIFIC FISCAL TERMS IN THE AGREEMENT. THE PRODUCTION AND RESERVES THAT WE

REPORT FOR THESE TYPES OF ARRANGEMENTS TYPICALLY VARY INVERSELY WITH OIL AND

GAS PRICE CHANGES. AS OIL AND GAS PRICES INCREASE, THE CASH FLOW AND VALUE

RECEIVED BY THE COMPANY INCREASE; HOWEVER, THE PRODUCTION VOLUMES AND RESERVES

REQUIRED TO ACHIEVE THIS VALUE WILL TYPICALLY BE LOWER BECAUSE OF THE HIGHER

PRICES. WHEN PRICES DECREASE, THE OPPOSITE EFFECT GENERALLY OCCURS. THE

PERCENTAGE OF TOTAL LIQUIDS AND NATURAL GAS PROVED RESERVES (CONSOLIDATED

SUBSIDIARIES PLUS EQUITY COMPANIES) AT YEAR-END 2013 THAT WERE ASSOCIATED WITH

PRODUCTION SHARING CONTRACT ARRANGEMENTS WAS 11 PERCENT OF LIQUIDS, 9 PERCENT

OF NATURAL GAS AND 10 PERCENT ON AN OIL-EQUIVALENT BASIS (GAS CONVERTED TO

OIL-EQUIVALENT AT 6 BILLION CUBIC FEET = 1 MILLION BARRELS).

NET PROVED DEVELOPED RESERVES ARE THOSE VOLUMES THAT

ARE EXPECTED TO BE RECOVERED THROUGH EXISTING WELLS WITH EXISTING EQUIPMENT AND

OPERATING METHODS OR IN WHICH THE COST OF THE REQUIRED EQUIPMENT IS RELATIVELY

MINOR COMPARED TO THE COST OF A NEW WELL. NET PROVED UNDEVELOPED RESERVES ARE

THOSE VOLUMES THAT ARE EXPECTED TO BE RECOVERED FROM NEW WELLS ON UNDRILLED

ACREAGE, OR FROM EXISTING WELLS WHERE A RELATIVELY MAJOR EXPENDITURE IS

REQUIRED FOR RECOMPLETION.

CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS LIQUIDS AND NATURAL GAS

PRODUCTION QUANTITIES SHOWN ARE THE NET VOLUMES WITHDRAWN FROM EXXONMOBIL’S OIL

AND GAS RESERVES. THE NATURAL GAS QUANTITIES DIFFER FROM THE QUANTITIES OF GAS

DELIVERED FOR SALE BY THE PRODUCING FUNCTION AS REPORTED IN THE OPERATING SUMMARY

DUE TO VOLUMES CONSUMED OR FLARED AND INVENTORY CHANGES.

THE CHANGES BETWEEN 2012 YEAR-END PROVED RESERVES AND

2013 YEAR-END PROVED RESERVES REFLECT THE EXTENSIONS AND DISCOVERIES IN THE

UNITED STATES AND THE MIDDLE EAST.

STANDARDIZED MEASURE OF DISCOUNTED

FUTURE CASH FLOWS

AS REQUIRED BY THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING

STANDARDS BOARD, THE STANDARDIZED MEASURE OF DISCOUNTED FUTURE NET CASH FLOWS

IS COMPUTED BY APPLYING FIRST-DAY-OF-THE-MONTH AVERAGE PRICES,

YEAR-END COSTS AND LEGISLATED TAX RATES AND A DISCOUNT FACTOR OF 10

PERCENT TO NET PROVED RESERVES. THE STANDARDIZED MEASURE INCLUDES COSTS

FOR FUTURE DISMANTLEMENT, ABANDONMENT AND REHABILITATION OBLIGATIONS.

THE CORPORATION BELIEVES THE STANDARDIZED MEASURE DOES NOT PROVIDE

A RELIABLE ESTIMATE OF THE CORPORATION’S EXPECTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS TO BE

OBTAINED FROM THE DEVELOPMENT AND PRODUCTION OF ITS OIL AND GAS PROPERTIES OR

OF THE VALUE OF ITS PROVED OIL AND GAS RESERVES. THE STANDARDIZED MEASURE IS

PREPARED ON THE BASIS OF CERTAIN PRESCRIBED ASSUMPTIONS INCLUDING

FIRST-DAY-OF-THE-MONTH AVERAGE PRICES, WHICH REPRESENT DISCRETE POINTS IN TIME

AND THEREFORE MAY CAUSE SIGNIFICANT VARIABILITY IN CASH FLOWS FROM YEAR TO YEAR

AS PRICES CHANGE.
