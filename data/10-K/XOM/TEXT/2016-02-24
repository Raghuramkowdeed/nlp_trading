ITEM 1.       BUSINESS

EXXON MOBIL CORPORATION WAS INCORPORATED IN THE STATE OF

NEW JERSEY IN 1882. DIVISIONS AND AFFILIATED COMPANIES OF EXXONMOBIL OPERATE OR

MARKET PRODUCTS IN THE UNITED STATES AND MOST OTHER COUNTRIES OF THE WORLD.

THEIR PRINCIPAL BUSINESS IS ENERGY, INVOLVING EXPLORATION FOR, AND PRODUCTION

OF, CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS, MANUFACTURE OF PETROLEUM PRODUCTS AND

TRANSPORTATION AND SALE OF CRUDE OIL, NATURAL GAS AND PETROLEUM PRODUCTS.

EXXONMOBIL IS A MAJOR MANUFACTURER AND MARKETER OF COMMODITY PETROCHEMICALS, INCLUDING

OLEFINS, AROMATICS, POLYETHYLENE AND POLYPROPYLENE PLASTICS AND A WIDE VARIETY OF

SPECIALTY PRODUCTS. AFFILIATES OF EXXONMOBIL CONDUCT EXTENSIVE RESEARCH

PROGRAMS IN SUPPORT OF THESE BUSINESSES.

EXXON MOBIL CORPORATION HAS SEVERAL DIVISIONS AND HUNDREDS

OF AFFILIATES, MANY WITH NAMES THAT INCLUDE

EXXONMOBIL

,

EXXON

,

ESSO,

MOBIL

OR

XTO

. FOR CONVENIENCE AND SIMPLICITY, IN THIS REPORT THE

TERMS

EXXONMOBIL, EXXON, ESSO, MOBIL

AND

XTO

, AS WELL AS TERMS

LIKE

CORPORATION

,

COMPANY

,

OUR

,

WE

AND

ITS

,

ARE SOMETIMES USED AS ABBREVIATED REFERENCES TO SPECIFIC AFFILIATES OR GROUPS

OF AFFILIATES. THE PRECISE MEANING DEPENDS ON THE CONTEXT IN QUESTION.

THROUGHOUT EXXONMOBIL’S BUSINESSES, NEW AND ONGOING

MEASURES ARE TAKEN TO PREVENT AND MINIMIZE THE IMPACT OF OUR OPERATIONS ON AIR,

WATER AND GROUND. THESE INCLUDE A SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT IN REFINING

INFRASTRUCTURE AND TECHNOLOGY TO MANUFACTURE CLEAN FUELS, AS WELL AS PROJECTS

TO MONITOR AND REDUCE NITROGEN OXIDE, SULFUR OXIDE AND GREENHOUSE GAS

EMISSIONS, AND EXPENDITURES FOR ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS. USING DEFINITIONS

AND GUIDELINES ESTABLISHED BY THE AMERICAN PETROLEUM INSTITUTE, EXXONMOBIL’S

2015 WORLDWIDE ENVIRONMENTAL EXPENDITURES FOR ALL SUCH PREVENTATIVE AND

REMEDIATION STEPS, INCLUDING EXXONMOBIL’S SHARE OF EQUITY COMPANY EXPENDITURES,

WERE $5.6 BILLION, OF WHICH $3.8 BILLION WERE INCLUDED IN EXPENSES

WITH THE REMAINDER IN CAPITAL EXPENDITURES. THE TOTAL COST FOR SUCH ACTIVITIES

IS EXPECTED TO DECREASE TO APPROXIMATELY $5 BILLION IN 2016 AND 2017,

MAINLY REFLECTING LOWER PROJECT ACTIVITY IN CANADA. CAPITAL EXPENDITURES ARE

EXPECTED TO ACCOUNT FOR APPROXIMATELY 30 PERCENT OF THE TOTAL.

THE ENERGY AND PETROCHEMICAL INDUSTRIES ARE HIGHLY

COMPETITIVE. THERE IS COMPETITION WITHIN THE INDUSTRIES AND ALSO WITH OTHER

INDUSTRIES IN SUPPLYING THE ENERGY, FUEL AND CHEMICAL NEEDS OF BOTH INDUSTRIAL

AND INDIVIDUAL CONSUMERS. THE CORPORATION COMPETES WITH OTHER FIRMS IN THE SALE

OR PURCHASE OF NEEDED GOODS AND SERVICES IN MANY NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL

MARKETS AND EMPLOYS ALL METHODS OF COMPETITION WHICH ARE LAWFUL AND APPROPRIATE

FOR SUCH PURPOSES.

OPERATING DATA AND INDUSTRY SEGMENT INFORMATION FOR THE

CORPORATION ARE CONTAINED IN THE FINANCIAL SECTION OF THIS REPORT UNDER THE

FOLLOWING: “QUARTERLY INFORMATION”, “NOTE 18: DISCLOSURES ABOUT SEGMENTS

AND RELATED INFORMATION” AND “OPERATING SUMMARY”. INFORMATION ON OIL AND GAS

RESERVES IS CONTAINED IN THE “OIL AND GAS RESERVES” PART OF THE “SUPPLEMENTAL

INFORMATION ON OIL AND GAS EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION ACTIVITIES” PORTION OF

THE FINANCIAL SECTION OF THIS REPORT.

EXXONMOBIL HAS A LONG‐STANDING COMMITMENT TO THE

DEVELOPMENT OF PROPRIETARY TECHNOLOGY. WE HAVE A WIDE ARRAY OF RESEARCH

PROGRAMS DESIGNED TO MEET THE NEEDS IDENTIFIED IN EACH OF OUR BUSINESS SEGMENTS.

INFORMATION ON COMPANY‐SPONSORED RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT SPENDING IS

CONTAINED IN “NOTE 3: MISCELLANEOUS FINANCIAL INFORMATION” OF THE

FINANCIAL SECTION OF THIS REPORT. EXXONMOBIL HELD APPROXIMATELY 11 THOUSAND

ACTIVE PATENTS WORLDWIDE AT THE END OF 2015. FOR TECHNOLOGY LICENSED TO THIRD

PARTIES, REVENUES TOTALED APPROXIMATELY $158 MILLION IN 2015. ALTHOUGH

TECHNOLOGY IS AN IMPORTANT CONTRIBUTOR TO THE OVERALL OPERATIONS AND RESULTS OF

OUR COMPANY, THE PROFITABILITY OF EACH BUSINESS SEGMENT IS NOT DEPENDENT ON ANY

INDIVIDUAL PATENT, TRADE SECRET, TRADEMARK, LICENSE, FRANCHISE OR CONCESSION.

THE NUMBER OF REGULAR EMPLOYEES WAS 73.5 THOUSAND, 75.3 THOUSAND,

AND 75.0 THOUSAND AT YEARS ENDED 2015, 2014 AND 2013, RESPECTIVELY.

REGULAR EMPLOYEES ARE DEFINED AS ACTIVE EXECUTIVE, MANAGEMENT, PROFESSIONAL,

TECHNICAL AND WAGE EMPLOYEES WHO WORK FULL TIME OR PART TIME FOR THE

CORPORATION AND ARE COVERED BY THE CORPORATION’S BENEFIT PLANS AND PROGRAMS.

REGULAR EMPLOYEES DO NOT INCLUDE EMPLOYEES OF THE COMPANY‐OPERATED RETAIL

SITES (CORS). THE NUMBER OF CORS EMPLOYEES WAS 2.1 THOUSAND, 8.4 THOUSAND,

AND 9.8 THOUSAND AT YEARS ENDED 2015, 2014 AND 2013, RESPECTIVELY. THE

DECREASE IN CORS EMPLOYEES REFLECTS THE MULTI‐YEAR TRANSITION OF THE COMPANY‐OPERATED

RETAIL NETWORK IN PORTIONS OF EUROPE TO A MORE CAPITAL‐EFFICIENT BRANDED

WHOLESALER MODEL.

INFORMATION CONCERNING THE SOURCE AND AVAILABILITY OF RAW

MATERIALS USED IN THE CORPORATION’S BUSINESS, THE EXTENT OF SEASONALITY IN THE

1

ITEM 1A.       RISK FACTORS

EXXONMOBIL’S FINANCIAL AND OPERATING

RESULTS ARE SUBJECT TO A VARIETY OF RISKS INHERENT IN THE GLOBAL OIL, GAS, AND

PETROCHEMICAL BUSINESSES. MANY OF THESE RISK FACTORS ARE NOT WITHIN THE

COMPANY’S CONTROL AND COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, OUR FINANCIAL AND

OPERATING RESULTS, OR OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION. THESE RISK FACTORS INCLUDE.

SUPPLY AND DEMAND

THE OIL, GAS, AND PETROCHEMICAL BUSINESSES ARE

FUNDAMENTALLY COMMODITY BUSINESSES. THIS MEANS EXXONMOBIL’S OPERATIONS AND

EARNINGS MAY BE SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTED BY CHANGES IN OIL, GAS, AND

PETROCHEMICAL PRICES AND BY CHANGES IN MARGINS ON REFINED PRODUCTS. OIL, GAS,

PETROCHEMICAL, AND PRODUCT PRICES AND MARGINS IN TURN DEPEND ON LOCAL, REGIONAL,

AND GLOBAL EVENTS OR CONDITIONS THAT AFFECT SUPPLY AND DEMAND FOR THE RELEVANT

COMMODITY. ANY MATERIAL DECLINE IN OIL OR NATURAL GAS PRICES COULD HAVE A

MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON CERTAIN OF THE COMPANY’S OPERATIONS, ESPECIALLY IN

THE UPSTREAM SEGMENT, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND PROVED RESERVES. ON THE OTHER

HAND, A MATERIAL INCREASE IN OIL OR NATURAL GAS PRICES COULD HAVE A MATERIAL

ADVERSE EFFECT ON CERTAIN OF THE COMPANY’S OPERATIONS, ESPECIALLY IN THE

DOWNSTREAM AND CHEMICAL SEGMENTS.

ECONOMIC CONDITIONS.

THE DEMAND FOR ENERGY AND PETROCHEMICALS CORRELATES CLOSELY WITH

GENERAL ECONOMIC GROWTH RATES. THE OCCURRENCE OF RECESSIONS OR OTHER PERIODS OF

LOW OR NEGATIVE ECONOMIC GROWTH WILL TYPICALLY HAVE A DIRECT ADVERSE IMPACT ON

OUR RESULTS. OTHER FACTORS THAT AFFECT GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS IN THE WORLD

OR IN A MAJOR REGION, SUCH AS CHANGES IN POPULATION GROWTH RATES, PERIODS OF

CIVIL UNREST, GOVERNMENT AUSTERITY PROGRAMS, OR CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE

FLUCTUATIONS, CAN ALSO IMPACT THE DEMAND FOR ENERGY AND PETROCHEMICALS.

SOVEREIGN DEBT DOWNGRADES, DEFAULTS, INABILITY TO ACCESS DEBT MARKETS DUE TO

CREDIT OR LEGAL CONSTRAINTS, LIQUIDITY CRISES, THE BREAKUP OR RESTRUCTURING OF

FISCAL, MONETARY, OR POLITICAL SYSTEMS SUCH AS THE EUROPEAN UNION, AND OTHER

EVENTS OR CONDITIONS THAT IMPAIR THE FUNCTIONING OF FINANCIAL MARKETS AND

INSTITUTIONS ALSO POSE RISKS TO EXXONMOBIL, INCLUDING RISKS TO THE SAFETY OF

OUR FINANCIAL ASSETS AND TO THE ABILITY OF OUR PARTNERS AND CUSTOMERS TO

FULFILL THEIR COMMITMENTS TO EXXONMOBIL.

OTHER DEMAND-RELATED FACTORS.

OTHER FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT THE DEMAND FOR OIL, GAS,

AND PETROCHEMICALS, AND THEREFORE IMPACT OUR RESULTS, INCLUDE TECHNOLOGICAL

IMPROVEMENTS IN ENERGY EFFICIENCY; SEASONAL WEATHER PATTERNS, WHICH AFFECT THE

DEMAND FOR ENERGY ASSOCIATED WITH HEATING AND COOLING; INCREASED

COMPETITIVENESS OF ALTERNATIVE ENERGY SOURCES THAT HAVE SO FAR GENERALLY NOT

BEEN COMPETITIVE WITH OIL AND GAS WITHOUT THE BENEFIT OF GOVERNMENT SUBSIDIES

OR MANDATES; AND CHANGES IN TECHNOLOGY OR CONSUMER PREFERENCES THAT ALTER FUEL

CHOICES, SUCH AS TOWARD ALTERNATIVE FUELED OR ELECTRIC VEHICLES.

OTHER SUPPLY-RELATED FACTORS.

COMMODITY PRICES AND MARGINS ALSO VARY DEPENDING ON A

NUMBER OF FACTORS AFFECTING SUPPLY. FOR EXAMPLE, INCREASED SUPPLY FROM THE

DEVELOPMENT OF NEW OIL AND GAS SUPPLY SOURCES AND TECHNOLOGIES TO ENHANCE

RECOVERY FROM EXISTING SOURCES TEND TO REDUCE COMMODITY PRICES TO THE EXTENT

SUCH SUPPLY INCREASES ARE NOT OFFSET BY COMMENSURATE GROWTH IN DEMAND.

SIMILARLY, INCREASES IN INDUSTRY REFINING OR PETROCHEMICAL MANUFACTURING

CAPACITY TEND TO REDUCE MARGINS ON THE AFFECTED PRODUCTS. WORLD OIL, GAS, AND

PETROCHEMICAL SUPPLY LEVELS CAN ALSO BE AFFECTED BY FACTORS THAT REDUCE

AVAILABLE SUPPLIES, SUCH AS ADHERENCE BY MEMBER COUNTRIES TO OPEC PRODUCTION

QUOTAS AND THE OCCURRENCE OF WARS, HOSTILE ACTIONS, NATURAL DISASTERS,

DISRUPTIONS IN COMPETITORS’ OPERATIONS, OR UNEXPECTED UNAVAILABILITY OF

DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS THAT MAY DISRUPT SUPPLIES. TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE CAN ALSO

ALTER THE RELATIVE COSTS FOR COMPETITORS TO FIND, PRODUCE, AND REFINE OIL AND

GAS AND TO MANUFACTURE PETROCHEMICALS.

OTHER MARKET FACTORS.

EXXONMOBIL’S BUSINESS RESULTS ARE ALSO EXPOSED TO

POTENTIAL NEGATIVE IMPACTS DUE TO CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES, INFLATION,

CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES, AND OTHER LOCAL OR REGIONAL MARKET CONDITIONS. WE

GENERALLY DO NOT USE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS TO HEDGE MARKET EXPOSURES.

GOVERNMENT AND POLITICAL FACTORS

EXXONMOBIL’S RESULTS CAN BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY

POLITICAL OR REGULATORY DEVELOPMENTS AFFECTING OUR OPERATIONS.

ACCESS LIMITATIONS.

A NUMBER OF COUNTRIES LIMIT ACCESS TO THEIR OIL AND GAS RESOURCES, OR

MAY PLACE RESOURCES OFF-LIMITS FROM DEVELOPMENT ALTOGETHER. RESTRICTIONS ON

FOREIGN INVESTMENT IN THE OIL AND GAS SECTOR TEND TO INCREASE IN TIMES OF HIGH

COMMODITY PRICES, WHEN NATIONAL GOVERNMENTS MAY HAVE LESS NEED OF OUTSIDE

SOURCES OF PRIVATE CAPITAL. MANY COUNTRIES ALSO RESTRICT THE IMPORT OR EXPORT

OF CERTAIN PRODUCTS BASED ON POINT OF ORIGIN.

RESTRICTIONS ON DOING BUSINESS.

EXXONMOBIL IS SUBJECT TO LAWS AND SANCTIONS IMPOSED

BY THE U.S. OR BY OTHER JURISDICTIONS WHERE WE DO BUSINESS THAT MAY PROHIBIT

EXXONMOBIL OR CERTAIN OF ITS AFFILIATES FROM DOING BUSINESS IN CERTAIN

COUNTRIES, OR RESTRICTING THE KIND OF BUSINESS THAT MAY BE CONDUCTED. SUCH

RESTRICTIONS MAY PROVIDE A COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE TO COMPETITORS WHO MAY NOT BE

SUBJECT TO COMPARABLE RESTRICTIONS.

LACK OF LEGAL CERTAINTY.

SOME COUNTRIES IN WHICH WE DO BUSINESS LACK

WELL-DEVELOPED LEGAL SYSTEMS, OR HAVE NOT YET ADOPTED CLEAR REGULATORY

FRAMEWORKS FOR OIL AND GAS DEVELOPMENT. LACK OF LEGAL CERTAINTY EXPOSES OUR

OPERATIONS TO INCREASED RISK OF ADVERSE OR UNPREDICTABLE ACTIONS BY GOVERNMENT

OFFICIALS, AND ALSO MAKES IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR US TO ENFORCE OUR CONTRACTS. IN

SOME CASES THESE RISKS CAN BE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AGREEMENTS TO ARBITRATE

DISPUTES IN AN INTERNATIONAL FORUM, BUT THE ADEQUACY OF THIS REMEDY MAY STILL

DEPEND ON THE LOCAL LEGAL SYSTEM TO ENFORCE AN AWARD.

2

REGULATORY AND LITIGATION RISKS.

EVEN IN COUNTRIES WITH WELL-DEVELOPED LEGAL

SYSTEMS WHERE EXXONMOBIL DOES BUSINESS, WE REMAIN EXPOSED TO CHANGES IN LAW

(INCLUDING CHANGES THAT RESULT FROM INTERNATIONAL TREATIES AND ACCORDS) THAT

COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS, SUCH AS.

·

INCREASES IN TAXES OR GOVERNMENT ROYALTY RATES

(INCLUDING RETROACTIVE CLAIMS);

·

PRICE CONTROLS;

·

CHANGES IN ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS OR OTHER LAWS

THAT INCREASE OUR COST OF COMPLIANCE OR REDUCE OR DELAY AVAILABLE BUSINESS

OPPORTUNITIES (INCLUDING CHANGES IN LAWS RELATED TO OFFSHORE DRILLING

OPERATIONS, WATER USE, OR HYDRAULIC FRACTURING);

·

ADOPTION OF REGULATIONS MANDATING THE USE OF

ALTERNATIVE FUELS OR UNCOMPETITIVE FUEL COMPONENTS;

·

ADOPTION OF GOVERNMENT PAYMENT TRANSPARENCY

REGULATIONS THAT COULD REQUIRE US TO DISCLOSE COMPETITIVELY SENSITIVE

COMMERCIAL INFORMATION, OR THAT COULD CAUSE US TO VIOLATE THE NON-DISCLOSURE

LAWS OF OTHER COUNTRIES; AND

·

GOVERNMENT ACTIONS TO CANCEL CONTRACTS,

RE-DENOMINATE THE OFFICIAL CURRENCY, RENOUNCE OR DEFAULT ON OBLIGATIONS,

RENEGOTIATE TERMS UNILATERALLY, OR EXPROPRIATE ASSETS.

LEGAL REMEDIES AVAILABLE TO COMPENSATE US FOR

EXPROPRIATION OR OTHER TAKINGS MAY BE INADEQUATE.

WE ALSO MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY THE OUTCOME OF

LITIGATION, ESPECIALLY IN COUNTRIES SUCH AS THE UNITED STATES IN WHICH VERY

LARGE AND UNPREDICTABLE PUNITIVE DAMAGE AWARDS MAY OCCUR, OR BY GOVERNMENT

ENFORCEMENT PROCEEDINGS ALLEGING NON-COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE LAWS OR

REGULATIONS.

SECURITY CONCERNS.

SUCCESSFUL OPERATION OF PARTICULAR FACILITIES OR PROJECTS MAY BE

DISRUPTED BY CIVIL UNREST, ACTS OF SABOTAGE OR TERRORISM, AND OTHER LOCAL

SECURITY CONCERNS. SUCH CONCERNS MAY REQUIRE US TO INCUR GREATER COSTS FOR

SECURITY OR TO SHUT DOWN OPERATIONS FOR A PERIOD OF TIME.

CLIMATE CHANGE AND GREENHOUSE GAS RESTRICTIONS.

DUE TO CONCERN OVER THE RISK OF CLIMATE CHANGE, A NUMBER

OF COUNTRIES HAVE ADOPTED, OR ARE CONSIDERING THE ADOPTION OF, REGULATORY

FRAMEWORKS TO REDUCE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS. THESE INCLUDE ADOPTION OF CAP

AND TRADE REGIMES, CARBON TAXES, RESTRICTIVE PERMITTING, INCREASED EFFICIENCY

STANDARDS, AND INCENTIVES OR MANDATES FOR RENEWABLE ENERGY. THESE REQUIREMENTS

COULD MAKE OUR PRODUCTS MORE EXPENSIVE, LENGTHEN PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION TIMES,

AND REDUCE DEMAND FOR HYDROCARBONS, AS WELL AS SHIFT HYDROCARBON DEMAND TOWARD

RELATIVELY LOWER-CARBON SOURCES SUCH AS NATURAL GAS. CURRENT AND PENDING

GREENHOUSE GAS REGULATIONS MAY ALSO INCREASE OUR COMPLIANCE COSTS, SUCH AS FOR

MONITORING OR SEQUESTERING EMISSIONS.

GOVERNMENT SPONSORSHIP OF ALTERNATIVE ENERGY.

MANY GOVERNMENTS ARE PROVIDING TAX ADVANTAGES AND

OTHER SUBSIDIES TO SUPPORT ALTERNATIVE ENERGY SOURCES OR ARE MANDATING THE USE

OF SPECIFIC FUELS OR TECHNOLOGIES. GOVERNMENTS ARE ALSO PROMOTING RESEARCH INTO

NEW TECHNOLOGIES TO REDUCE THE COST AND INCREASE THE SCALABILITY OF ALTERNATIVE

ENERGY SOURCES. WE ARE CONDUCTING OUR OWN RESEARCH EFFORTS INTO ALTERNATIVE

ENERGY, SUCH AS THROUGH SPONSORSHIP OF THE GLOBAL CLIMATE AND ENERGY PROJECT AT

STANFORD UNIVERSITY AND RESEARCH INTO LIQUID PRODUCTS FROM ALGAE AND BIOMASS

THAT CAN BE FURTHER CONVERTED TO TRANSPORTATION FUELS. OUR FUTURE RESULTS MAY

DEPEND IN PART ON THE SUCCESS OF OUR RESEARCH EFFORTS AND ON OUR ABILITY TO

ADAPT AND APPLY THE STRENGTHS OF OUR CURRENT BUSINESS MODEL TO PROVIDING THE ENERGY

PRODUCTS OF THE FUTURE IN A COST-COMPETITIVE MANNER. SEE “MANAGEMENT

EFFECTIVENESS” BELOW.

MANAGEMENT EFFECTIVENESS

IN ADDITION TO EXTERNAL ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL

FACTORS, OUR FUTURE BUSINESS RESULTS ALSO DEPEND ON OUR ABILITY TO MANAGE

SUCCESSFULLY THOSE FACTORS THAT ARE AT LEAST IN PART WITHIN OUR CONTROL. THE

EXTENT TO WHICH WE MANAGE THESE FACTORS WILL IMPACT OUR PERFORMANCE RELATIVE TO

COMPETITION. FOR PROJECTS IN WHICH WE ARE NOT THE OPERATOR, WE DEPEND ON THE

MANAGEMENT EFFECTIVENESS OF ONE OR MORE CO-VENTURERS WHOM WE DO NOT CONTROL.

EXPLORATION AND DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM.

OUR ABILITY TO MAINTAIN AND GROW OUR OIL AND GAS

PRODUCTION DEPENDS ON THE SUCCESS OF OUR EXPLORATION AND DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS.

AMONG OTHER FACTORS, WE MUST CONTINUOUSLY IMPROVE OUR ABILITY TO IDENTIFY THE

MOST PROMISING RESOURCE PROSPECTS AND APPLY OUR PROJECT MANAGEMENT EXPERTISE TO

BRING DISCOVERED RESOURCES ON LINE AS SCHEDULED AND WITHIN BUDGET.

PROJECT MANAGEMENT.

THE SUCCESS OF EXXONMOBIL’S UPSTREAM, DOWNSTREAM, AND CHEMICAL

BUSINESSES DEPENDS ON COMPLEX, LONG-TERM, CAPITAL INTENSIVE PROJECTS. THESE

PROJECTS IN TURN REQUIRE A HIGH DEGREE OF PROJECT MANAGEMENT EXPERTISE TO

MAXIMIZE EFFICIENCY. SPECIFIC FACTORS THAT CAN AFFECT THE PERFORMANCE OF MAJOR

PROJECTS INCLUDE OUR ABILITY TO: NEGOTIATE SUCCESSFULLY WITH JOINT VENTURERS,

PARTNERS, GOVERNMENTS, SUPPLIERS, CUSTOMERS, OR OTHERS; MODEL AND OPTIMIZE

RESERVOIR PERFORMANCE; DEVELOP MARKETS FOR PROJECT OUTPUTS, WHETHER THROUGH

LONG-TERM CONTRACTS OR THE DEVELOPMENT OF EFFECTIVE SPOT MARKETS; MANAGE

CHANGES IN OPERATING CONDITIONS AND COSTS, INCLUDING COSTS OF THIRD PARTY

EQUIPMENT OR SERVICES SUCH AS DRILLING RIGS AND SHIPPING; PREVENT, TO THE

EXTENT POSSIBLE, AND RESPOND EFFECTIVELY TO UNFORESEEN TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES

THAT COULD DELAY PROJECT STARTUP OR CAUSE UNSCHEDULED PROJECT DOWNTIME; AND

INFLUENCE THE PERFORMANCE OF PROJECT OPERATORS WHERE EXXONMOBIL DOES NOT

PERFORM THAT ROLE.

3

THE TERM “PROJECT” AS USED IN THIS REPORT CAN REFER TO

A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT ACTIVITIES AND DOES NOT NECESSARILY HAVE THE SAME

MEANING AS IN ANY GOVERNMENT PAYMENT TRANSPARENCY REPORTS.

OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCY.

AN IMPORTANT COMPONENT OF EXXONMOBIL’S COMPETITIVE

PERFORMANCE, ESPECIALLY GIVEN THE COMMODITY-BASED NATURE OF MANY OF OUR

BUSINESSES, IS OUR ABILITY TO OPERATE EFFICIENTLY, INCLUDING OUR ABILITY TO

MANAGE EXPENSES AND IMPROVE PRODUCTION YIELDS ON AN ONGOING BASIS. THIS

REQUIRES CONTINUOUS MANAGEMENT FOCUS, INCLUDING TECHNOLOGY IMPROVEMENTS, COST

CONTROL, PRODUCTIVITY ENHANCEMENTS, REGULAR REAPPRAISAL OF OUR ASSET PORTFOLIO,

AND THE RECRUITMENT, DEVELOPMENT, AND RETENTION OF HIGH CALIBER EMPLOYEES.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT.

TO MAINTAIN OUR COMPETITIVE POSITION, ESPECIALLY IN

LIGHT OF THE TECHNOLOGICAL NATURE OF OUR BUSINESSES AND THE NEED FOR CONTINUOUS

EFFICIENCY IMPROVEMENT, EXXONMOBIL’S RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ORGANIZATIONS

MUST BE SUCCESSFUL AND ABLE TO ADAPT TO A CHANGING MARKET AND POLICY

ENVIRONMENT, INCLUDING DEVELOPING TECHNOLOGIES TO HELP REDUCE GREENHOUSE GAS

EMISSIONS.

SAFETY, BUSINESS CONTROLS, AND ENVIRONMENTAL RISK

MANAGEMENT.

OUR RESULTS DEPEND ON

MANAGEMENT’S ABILITY TO MINIMIZE THE INHERENT RISKS OF OIL, GAS, AND

PETROCHEMICAL OPERATIONS, TO CONTROL EFFECTIVELY OUR BUSINESS ACTIVITIES, AND

TO MINIMIZE THE POTENTIAL FOR HUMAN ERROR. WE APPLY RIGOROUS MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS

AND CONTINUOUS FOCUS TO WORKPLACE SAFETY AND TO AVOIDING SPILLS OR OTHER

ADVERSE ENVIRONMENTAL EVENTS. FOR EXAMPLE, WE WORK TO MINIMIZE SPILLS THROUGH A

COMBINED PROGRAM OF EFFECTIVE OPERATIONS INTEGRITY MANAGEMENT, ONGOING

UPGRADES, KEY EQUIPMENT REPLACEMENTS, AND COMPREHENSIVE INSPECTION AND

SURVEILLANCE. SIMILARLY, WE ARE IMPLEMENTING COST-EFFECTIVE NEW TECHNOLOGIES

AND ADOPTING NEW OPERATING PRACTICES TO REDUCE AIR EMISSIONS, NOT ONLY IN

RESPONSE TO GOVERNMENT REQUIREMENTS BUT ALSO TO ADDRESS COMMUNITY PRIORITIES.

WE ALSO MAINTAIN A DISCIPLINED FRAMEWORK OF INTERNAL CONTROLS AND APPLY A

CONTROLS MANAGEMENT SYSTEM FOR MONITORING COMPLIANCE WITH THIS FRAMEWORK.

SUBSTANTIAL LIABILITIES AND OTHER ADVERSE IMPACTS COULD RESULT IF OUR

MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS AND CONTROLS DO NOT FUNCTION AS INTENDED. THE ABILITY TO

INSURE AGAINST SUCH RISKS IS LIMITED BY THE CAPACITY OF THE APPLICABLE

INSURANCE MARKETS, WHICH MAY NOT BE SUFFICIENT.

BUSINESS RISKS ALSO INCLUDE THE RISK OF CYBERSECURITY

BREACHES. IF OUR SYSTEMS FOR PROTECTING AGAINST CYBERSECURITY RISKS PROVE NOT

TO BE SUFFICIENT, EXXONMOBIL COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED SUCH AS BY HAVING ITS

BUSINESS SYSTEMS COMPROMISED, ITS PROPRIETARY INFORMATION ALTERED, LOST OR

STOLEN, OR ITS BUSINESS OPERATIONS DISRUPTED.

PREPAREDNESS.

OUR OPERATIONS MAY BE DISRUPTED BY SEVERE WEATHER EVENTS, NATURAL DISASTERS,

HUMAN ERROR, AND SIMILAR EVENTS. FOR EXAMPLE, HURRICANES MAY DAMAGE OUR

OFFSHORE PRODUCTION FACILITIES OR COASTAL REFINING AND PETROCHEMICAL PLANTS IN

VULNERABLE AREAS. OUR FACILITIES ARE DESIGNED, CONSTRUCTED, AND OPERATED TO

WITHSTAND A VARIETY OF EXTREME CLIMATIC AND OTHER CONDITIONS, WITH SAFETY

FACTORS BUILT IN TO COVER A NUMBER OF ENGINEERING UNCERTAINTIES, INCLUDING

THOSE ASSOCIATED WITH WAVE, WIND, AND CURRENT INTENSITY, MARINE ICE FLOW

PATTERNS, PERMAFROST STABILITY, STORM SURGE MAGNITUDE, TEMPERATURE EXTREMES,

EXTREME RAIN FALL EVENTS, AND EARTHQUAKES. OUR CONSIDERATION OF CHANGING

WEATHER CONDITIONS AND INCLUSION OF SAFETY FACTORS IN DESIGN COVERS THE

ENGINEERING UNCERTAINTIES THAT CLIMATE CHANGE AND OTHER EVENTS MAY POTENTIALLY

INTRODUCE. OUR ABILITY TO MITIGATE THE ADVERSE IMPACTS OF THESE EVENTS DEPENDS

IN PART UPON THE EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR ROBUST FACILITY ENGINEERING AS WELL AS

OUR RIGOROUS DISASTER PREPAREDNESS AND RESPONSE AND BUSINESS CONTINUITY

PLANNING.

PROJECTIONS, ESTIMATES, AND DESCRIPTIONS OF

EXXONMOBIL’S PLANS AND OBJECTIVES INCLUDED OR INCORPORATED IN ITEMS 1, 1A, 2, 7

AND 7A OF THIS REPORT ARE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS. ACTUAL FUTURE RESULTS,

INCLUDING PROJECT COMPLETION DATES, PRODUCTION RATES, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES,

A. SUMMARY OF OIL AND GAS RESERVES AT

YEAR-END 2015

THE TABLE BELOW SUMMARIZES THE OIL-EQUIVALENT PROVED

RESERVES IN EACH GEOGRAPHIC AREA AND BY PRODUCT TYPE FOR CONSOLIDATED

SUBSIDIARIES AND EQUITY COMPANIES. GAS IS CONVERTED TO AN OIL-EQUIVALENT BASIS

AT SIX MILLION CUBIC FEET PER ONE THOUSAND BARRELS. THE CORPORATION HAS

REPORTED PROVED RESERVES ON THE BASIS OF THE AVERAGE OF THE

FIRST-DAY-OF-THE-MONTH PRICE FOR EACH MONTH DURING THE LAST 12-MONTH PERIOD. WHEN

CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS PRICES ARE IN THE RANGE SEEN IN EARLY 2016 FOR AN

EXTENDED PERIOD OF TIME, UNDER THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION’S (SEC)

DEFINITION OF PROVED RESERVES, CERTAIN QUANTITIES OF OIL AND NATURAL GAS COULD

TEMPORARILY NOT QUALIFY AS PROVED RESERVES. UNDER THE TERMS OF CERTAIN

CONTRACTUAL ARRANGEMENTS OR GOVERNMENT ROYALTY REGIMES, LOWER PRICES CAN ALSO

INCREASE PROVED RESERVES ATTRIBUTABLE TO EXXONMOBIL. OTHERWISE, NO MAJOR

DISCOVERY OR OTHER FAVORABLE OR ADVERSE EVENT HAS OCCURRED SINCE DECEMBER 31,

2015, THAT WOULD CAUSE A SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN THE ESTIMATED PROVED RESERVES AS

OF THAT DATE.

IN THE PRECEDING RESERVES INFORMATION, CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARY AND

EQUITY COMPANY RESERVES ARE REPORTED SEPARATELY. HOWEVER, THE CORPORATION

OPERATES ITS BUSINESS WITH THE SAME VIEW OF EQUITY COMPANY RESERVES AS IT HAS

FOR RESERVES FROM CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES.

THE CORPORATION ANTICIPATES SEVERAL PROJECTS WILL COME

ONLINE OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS PROVIDING ADDITIONAL PRODUCTION CAPACITY.

HOWEVER, ACTUAL VOLUMES WILL VARY FROM YEAR TO YEAR DUE TO THE TIMING OF

INDIVIDUAL PROJECT START-UPS; OPERATIONAL OUTAGES; RESERVOIR PERFORMANCE;

PERFORMANCE OF ENHANCED OIL RECOVERY PROJECTS; REGULATORY CHANGES; THE IMPACT

OF FISCAL AND COMMERCIAL TERMS; ASSET SALES; WEATHER EVENTS; PRICE EFFECTS ON

PRODUCTION SHARING CONTRACTS; CHANGES IN THE AMOUNT AND TIMING OF CAPITAL

INVESTMENTS THAT MAY VARY DEPENDING ON THE OIL AND GAS PRICE ENVIRONMENT; AND

OTHER FACTORS DESCRIBED IN ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS.

THE ESTIMATION OF PROVED RESERVES, WHICH IS BASED ON THE

REQUIREMENT OF REASONABLE CERTAINTY, IS AN ONGOING PROCESS BASED ON RIGOROUS

TECHNICAL EVALUATIONS, COMMERCIAL AND MARKET ASSESSMENTS AND DETAILED ANALYSIS

OF WELL AND RESERVOIR INFORMATION SUCH AS FLOW RATES AND RESERVOIR PRESSURE

DECLINES. FURTHERMORE, THE CORPORATION ONLY RECORDS PROVED RESERVES FOR

PROJECTS WHICH HAVE RECEIVED SIGNIFICANT FUNDING COMMITMENTS BY MANAGEMENT MADE

TOWARD THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE RESERVES. ALTHOUGH THE CORPORATION IS REASONABLY

CERTAIN THAT PROVED RESERVES WILL BE PRODUCED, THE TIMING AND AMOUNT RECOVERED

CAN BE AFFECTED BY A NUMBER OF FACTORS INCLUDING COMPLETION OF DEVELOPMENT

PROJECTS, RESERVOIR PERFORMANCE, REGULATORY APPROVALS AND SIGNIFICANT CHANGES

IN PROJECTIONS OF LONG-TERM OIL AND NATURAL GAS PRICE LEVELS. IN ADDITION,

PROVED RESERVES COULD BE AFFECTED BY AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF LOW PRICES WHICH

COULD REDUCE THE LEVEL OF THE CORPORATION’S CAPITAL SPENDING AND ALSO IMPACT

OUR PARTNERS’ CAPACITY TO FUND THEIR SHARE OF JOINT PROJECTS.

WHEN CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS PRICES ARE IN THE RANGE SEEN

IN LATE 2015 AND EARLY 2016 FOR AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF TIME, UNDER THE SEC

DEFINITION OF PROVED RESERVES, CERTAIN QUANTITIES OF OIL AND NATURAL GAS, SUCH

AS OIL SANDS OPERATIONS IN CANADA AND NATURAL GAS OPERATIONS IN NORTH AMERICA

COULD TEMPORARILY NOT QUALIFY AS PROVED RESERVES. AMOUNTS THAT COULD BE

REQUIRED TO BE DE-BOOKED AS PROVED RESERVES ON AN SEC BASIS ARE SUBJECT TO

BEING RE-BOOKED AS PROVED RESERVES AT SOME POINT IN THE FUTURE WHEN PRICE

LEVELS RECOVER, COSTS DECLINE, OR OPERATING EFFICIENCIES OCCUR. UNDER THE TERMS

OF CERTAIN CONTRACTUAL ARRANGEMENTS OR GOVERNMENT ROYALTY REGIMES, LOWER PRICES

CAN ALSO INCREASE PROVED RESERVES ATTRIBUTABLE TO EXXONMOBIL. WE DO NOT EXPECT

ANY TEMPORARY CHANGES IN REPORTED PROVED RESERVES UNDER SEC DEFINITIONS TO

AFFECT THE OPERATION OF THE UNDERLYING PROJECTS OR TO ALTER OUR OUTLOOK FOR

FUTURE PRODUCTION VOLUMES.

B. TECHNOLOGIES USED IN

ESTABLISHING PROVED RESERVES ADDITIONS IN 2015

ADDITIONS TO EXXONMOBIL’S PROVED RESERVES IN 2015 WERE

BASED ON ESTIMATES GENERATED THROUGH THE INTEGRATION OF AVAILABLE AND APPROPRIATE

GEOLOGICAL, ENGINEERING AND PRODUCTION DATA, UTILIZING WELL-ESTABLISHED

TECHNOLOGIES THAT HAVE BEEN DEMONSTRATED IN THE FIELD TO YIELD REPEATABLE AND

CONSISTENT RESULTS.

DATA USED IN THESE INTEGRATED ASSESSMENTS INCLUDED

INFORMATION OBTAINED DIRECTLY FROM THE SUBSURFACE VIA WELLBORES, SUCH AS WELL

LOGS, RESERVOIR CORE SAMPLES, FLUID SAMPLES, STATIC AND DYNAMIC PRESSURE INFORMATION,

PRODUCTION TEST DATA, AND SURVEILLANCE AND PERFORMANCE INFORMATION. THE DATA

UTILIZED ALSO INCLUDED SUBSURFACE INFORMATION OBTAINED THROUGH INDIRECT

MEASUREMENTS INCLUDING HIGH-QUALITY 3-D AND 4-D SEISMIC DATA, CALIBRATED WITH

AVAILABLE WELL CONTROL INFORMATION. THE TOOLS USED TO INTERPRET THE DATA

INCLUDED PROPRIETARY SEISMIC PROCESSING SOFTWARE, PROPRIETARY RESERVOIR

MODELING AND SIMULATION SOFTWARE, AND COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE DATA ANALYSIS

PACKAGES.

IN SOME CIRCUMSTANCES, WHERE APPROPRIATE ANALOG RESERVOIRS

WERE AVAILABLE, RESERVOIR PARAMETERS FROM THESE ANALOGS WERE USED TO INCREASE

THE QUALITY OF AND CONFIDENCE IN THE RESERVES ESTIMATES.

C. QUALIFICATIONS OF

RESERVES TECHNICAL OVERSIGHT GROUP AND INTERNAL CONTROLS OVER PROVED RESERVES

EXXONMOBIL HAS A DEDICATED GLOBAL RESERVES GROUP THAT

PROVIDES TECHNICAL OVERSIGHT AND IS SEPARATE FROM THE OPERATING ORGANIZATION.

PRIMARY RESPONSIBILITIES OF THIS GROUP INCLUDE OVERSIGHT OF THE RESERVES

ESTIMATION PROCESS FOR COMPLIANCE WITH SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (SEC)

RULES AND REGULATIONS, REVIEW OF ANNUAL CHANGES IN RESERVES ESTIMATES, AND THE

REPORTING OF EXXONMOBIL’S PROVED RESERVES. THIS GROUP ALSO MAINTAINS THE

OFFICIAL COMPANY RESERVES ESTIMATES FOR EXXONMOBIL’S PROVED RESERVES OF CRUDE

AND NATURAL GAS LIQUIDS, BITUMEN, SYNTHETIC OIL AND NATURAL GAS. IN ADDITION,

THE GROUP PROVIDES TRAINING TO PERSONNEL INVOLVED IN THE RESERVES ESTIMATION

AND REPORTING PROCESS WITHIN EXXONMOBIL AND ITS AFFILIATES. THE MANAGER OF THE

GLOBAL RESERVES GROUP HAS MORE THAN 30 YEARS OF EXPERIENCE IN RESERVOIR ENGINEERING

AND RESERVES ASSESSMENT AND HAS A DEGREE IN ENGINEERING. HE IS AN ACTIVE MEMBER

OF THE SOCIETY OF PETROLEUM ENGINEERS (SPE) AND PREVIOUSLY SERVED ON THE SPE

OIL AND GAS RESERVES COMMITTEE. THE GROUP IS STAFFED WITH INDIVIDUALS THAT HAVE

AN AVERAGE OF MORE THAN 20 YEARS OF TECHNICAL EXPERIENCE IN THE PETROLEUM

INDUSTRY, INCLUDING EXPERTISE IN THE CLASSIFICATION AND CATEGORIZATION OF

RESERVES UNDER THE SEC GUIDELINES. THIS GROUP INCLUDES INDIVIDUALS WHO HOLD

ADVANCED DEGREES IN EITHER ENGINEERING OR GEOLOGY. SEVERAL MEMBERS OF THE GROUP

HOLD PROFESSIONAL REGISTRATIONS IN THEIR FIELD OF EXPERTISE, AND A MEMBER

CURRENTLY SERVES ON THE SPE OIL AND GAS RESERVES COMMITTEE.

6

THE GLOBAL RESERVES GROUP MAINTAINS A

CENTRAL DATABASE CONTAINING THE OFFICIAL COMPANY RESERVES ESTIMATES.

APPROPRIATE CONTROLS, INCLUDING LIMITATIONS ON DATABASE ACCESS AND UPDATE

CAPABILITIES, ARE IN PLACE TO ENSURE DATA INTEGRITY WITHIN THIS CENTRAL

DATABASE. AN ANNUAL REVIEW OF THE SYSTEM’S CONTROLS IS PERFORMED BY INTERNAL

AUDIT. KEY COMPONENTS OF THE RESERVES ESTIMATION PROCESS INCLUDE TECHNICAL

EVALUATIONS AND ANALYSIS OF WELL AND FIELD PERFORMANCE AND A RIGOROUS PEER

REVIEW. NO CHANGES MAY BE MADE TO THE RESERVES ESTIMATES IN THE CENTRAL

DATABASE, INCLUDING ADDITIONS OF ANY NEW INITIAL RESERVES ESTIMATES OR

SUBSEQUENT REVISIONS, UNLESS THESE CHANGES HAVE BEEN THOROUGHLY REVIEWED AND

EVALUATED BY DULY AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL WITHIN THE OPERATING ORGANIZATION. IN

ADDITION, CHANGES TO RESERVES ESTIMATES THAT EXCEED CERTAIN THRESHOLDS REQUIRE

FURTHER REVIEW AND APPROVAL OF THE APPROPRIATE LEVEL OF MANAGEMENT WITHIN THE

OPERATING ORGANIZATION BEFORE THE CHANGES MAY BE MADE IN THE CENTRAL DATABASE.

ENDORSEMENT BY THE GLOBAL RESERVES GROUP FOR ALL PROVED RESERVES CHANGES IS A

MANDATORY COMPONENT OF THIS REVIEW PROCESS. AFTER ALL CHANGES ARE MADE, REVIEWS

ARE HELD WITH SENIOR MANAGEMENT FOR FINAL ENDORSEMENT.

2.

PROVED UNDEVELOPED RESERVES

AT YEAR-END 2015, APPROXIMATELY 6.8 BILLION OIL-EQUIVALENT

BARRELS (GOEB) OF EXXONMOBIL’S PROVED RESERVES WERE CLASSIFIED AS PROVED

UNDEVELOPED. THIS REPRESENTS 27 PERCENT OF THE 24.8 GOEB REPORTED IN PROVED

RESERVES. THIS COMPARES TO THE 8.8 GOEB OF PROVED UNDEVELOPED RESERVES REPORTED

AT THE END OF 2014. DURING THE YEAR, EXXONMOBIL CONDUCTED DEVELOPMENT

ACTIVITIES IN OVER 100 FIELDS THAT RESULTED IN THE TRANSFER OF APPROXIMATELY

2.7 GOEB FROM PROVED UNDEVELOPED TO PROVED DEVELOPED RESERVES BY YEAR-END. THE

LARGEST TRANSFERS WERE RELATED TO KEARL EXPANSION PROJECT START-UP AND DRILLING

ACTIVITY IN THE UNITED STATES. MAINLY DUE TO LOW PRICES DURING 2015, THE

CORPORATION RECLASSIFIED APPROXIMATELY 1 GOEB OF PROVED UNDEVELOPED RESERVES,

PRIMARILY NATURAL GAS RESERVES IN THE UNITED STATES, WHICH NO LONGER MEET THE

SEC DEFINITION OF PROVED RESERVES.

ONE OF EXXONMOBIL’S REQUIREMENTS FOR REPORTING PROVED

RESERVES IS THAT MANAGEMENT HAS MADE SIGNIFICANT FUNDING COMMITMENTS TOWARD THE

DEVELOPMENT OF THE RESERVES. EXXONMOBIL HAS A DISCIPLINED INVESTMENT STRATEGY

AND MANY MAJOR FIELDS REQUIRE LONG LEAD-TIME IN ORDER TO BE DEVELOPED.

DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS TYPICALLY TAKE TWO TO FOUR YEARS FROM THE TIME OF

RECORDING PROVED UNDEVELOPED RESERVES TO THE START OF PRODUCTION. HOWEVER, THE

DEVELOPMENT TIME FOR LARGE AND COMPLEX PROJECTS CAN EXCEED FIVE YEARS. DURING

2015, EXTENSIONS AND PURCHASES PRIMARILY RELATED TO UNITED STATES

UNCONVENTIONAL AND ABU DHABI DRILLING ADDED APPROXIMATELY 1.7 GOEB OF PROVED

UNDEVELOPED RESERVES. OVERALL, INVESTMENTS OF $19.4 BILLION WERE MADE BY THE

CORPORATION DURING 2015 TO PROGRESS THE DEVELOPMENT OF REPORTED PROVED

UNDEVELOPED RESERVES, INCLUDING $17 BILLION FOR OIL AND GAS PRODUCING

ACTIVITIES AND AN ADDITIONAL $2.4 BILLION FOR OTHER NON-OIL AND GAS PRODUCING ACTIVITIES

SUCH AS THE CONSTRUCTION OF SUPPORT INFRASTRUCTURE AND OTHER RELATED

FACILITIES. THESE INVESTMENTS REPRESENTED 76 PERCENT OF THE $25.4 BILLION IN

TOTAL REPORTED UPSTREAM CAPITAL AND EXPLORATION EXPENDITURES.

PROVED UNDEVELOPED RESERVES IN AUSTRALIA, THE UNITED

STATES, KAZAKHSTAN, THE NETHERLANDS, QATAR, AND NIGERIA HAVE REMAINED

UNDEVELOPED FOR FIVE YEARS OR MORE PRIMARILY DUE TO CONSTRAINTS ON THE CAPACITY

OF INFRASTRUCTURE, THE PACE OF CO-VENTURER/GOVERNMENT FUNDING, AS WELL AS THE

TIME REQUIRED TO COMPLETE DEVELOPMENT FOR VERY LARGE PROJECTS. THE CORPORATION

IS REASONABLY CERTAIN THAT THESE PROVED RESERVES WILL BE PRODUCED; HOWEVER, THE

TIMING AND AMOUNT RECOVERED CAN BE AFFECTED BY A NUMBER OF FACTORS INCLUDING

COMPLETION OF DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS, RESERVOIR PERFORMANCE, REGULATORY

APPROVALS, AND SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN LONG-TERM OIL AND NATURAL GAS PRICE

LEVELS. OF THE PROVED UNDEVELOPED RESERVES THAT HAVE BEEN REPORTED FOR FIVE OR

MORE YEARS, 84 PERCENT ARE CONTAINED IN THE AFOREMENTIONED COUNTRIES. THE

LARGEST OF THESE IS RELATED TO LNG/GAS PROJECTS IN AUSTRALIA, WHERE

CONSTRUCTION OF THE GORGON LNG PROJECT IS UNDER WAY. IN KAZAKHSTAN, THE PROVED

UNDEVELOPED RESERVES ARE RELATED TO THE REMAINDER OF THE INITIAL DEVELOPMENT OF

THE OFFSHORE KASHAGAN FIELD WHICH IS INCLUDED IN THE NORTH CASPIAN PRODUCTION

SHARING AGREEMENT AND THE TENGIZCHEVROIL JOINT VENTURE WHICH INCLUDES A

PRODUCTION LICENSE IN THE TENGIZ – KOROLEV FIELD COMPLEX. THE TENGIZCHEVROIL

JOINT VENTURE IS PRODUCING, AND PROVED UNDEVELOPED RESERVES WILL CONTINUE TO

MOVE TO PROVED DEVELOPED AS APPROVED DEVELOPMENT PHASES PROGRESS. IN THE NETHERLANDS,

THE GRONINGEN GAS FIELD HAS PROVED UNDEVELOPED RESERVES RELATED TO INSTALLATION

OF FUTURE STAGES OF COMPRESSION. THESE RESERVES WILL MOVE TO PROVED DEVELOPED

WHEN THE ADDITIONAL STAGES OF COMPRESSION ARE INSTALLED TO MAINTAIN FIELD

DELIVERY PRESSURE.

AVERAGE PRODUCTION PRICES HAVE BEEN CALCULATED BY USING

SALES QUANTITIES FROM THE CORPORATION’S OWN PRODUCTION AS THE DIVISOR. AVERAGE

PRODUCTION COSTS HAVE BEEN COMPUTED BY USING NET PRODUCTION QUANTITIES FOR THE

DIVISOR. THE VOLUMES OF CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS LIQUIDS (NGL) PRODUCTION USED

FOR THIS COMPUTATION ARE SHOWN IN THE OIL AND GAS PRODUCTION TABLE IN SECTION

3.A. THE VOLUMES OF NATURAL GAS USED IN THE CALCULATION ARE THE PRODUCTION

VOLUMES OF NATURAL GAS AVAILABLE FOR SALE AND ARE ALSO SHOWN IN SECTION 3.A.

THE NATURAL GAS AVAILABLE FOR SALE VOLUMES ARE DIFFERENT FROM THOSE SHOWN IN

THE RESERVES TABLE IN THE “OIL AND GAS RESERVES” PART OF THE “SUPPLEMENTAL

INFORMATION ON OIL AND GAS EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION ACTIVITIES” PORTION OF

THE FINANCIAL SECTION OF THIS REPORT DUE TO VOLUMES CONSUMED OR FLARED. GAS IS

CONVERTED TO AN OIL-EQUIVALENT BASIS AT SIX MILLION CUBIC FEET PER ONE THOUSAND

EXXONMOBIL’S INVESTMENT IN DEVELOPED AND UNDEVELOPED ACREAGE

IS COMPRISED OF NUMEROUS CONCESSIONS, BLOCKS AND LEASES. THE TERMS AND

CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH THE CORPORATION MAINTAINS EXPLORATION AND/OR PRODUCTION

RIGHTS TO THE ACREAGE ARE PROPERTY-SPECIFIC, CONTRACTUALLY DEFINED AND VARY

SIGNIFICANTLY FROM PROPERTY TO PROPERTY. WORK PROGRAMS ARE DESIGNED TO ENSURE

THAT THE EXPLORATION POTENTIAL OF ANY PROPERTY IS FULLY EVALUATED BEFORE

EXPIRATION. IN SOME INSTANCES, THE CORPORATION MAY ELECT TO RELINQUISH ACREAGE

IN ADVANCE OF THE CONTRACTUAL EXPIRATION DATE IF THE EVALUATION PROCESS IS

COMPLETE AND THERE IS NOT A BUSINESS BASIS FOR EXTENSION. IN CASES WHERE

ADDITIONAL TIME MAY BE REQUIRED TO FULLY EVALUATE ACREAGE, THE CORPORATION HAS

GENERALLY BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN OBTAINING EXTENSIONS. THE SCHEDULED EXPIRATION OF

LEASES AND CONCESSIONS FOR UNDEVELOPED ACREAGE OVER THE NEXT THREE YEARS IS NOT

EXPECTED TO HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON THE CORPORATION.

18

D. SUMMARY OF ACREAGE TERMS

UNITED STATES

OIL AND GAS EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION RIGHTS ARE ACQUIRED

FROM MINERAL INTEREST OWNERS THROUGH A LEASE. MINERAL INTEREST OWNERS INCLUDE

THE FEDERAL AND STATE GOVERNMENTS, AS WELL AS PRIVATE MINERAL INTEREST OWNERS.

LEASES TYPICALLY HAVE AN EXPLORATION PERIOD RANGING FROM ONE TO TEN YEARS, AND

A PRODUCTION PERIOD THAT NORMALLY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL PRODUCTION CEASES.

UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES, A LEASE MAY BE HELD BEYOND ITS EXPLORATION TERM

EVEN IF PRODUCTION HAS NOT COMMENCED. IN SOME INSTANCES REGARDING PRIVATE

CANADA

EXPLORATION LICENSES OR LEASES IN ONSHORE AREAS ARE

ACQUIRED FOR VARYING PERIODS OF TIME WITH RENEWALS OR EXTENSIONS POSSIBLE.

THESE LICENSES OR LEASES ENTITLE THE HOLDER TO CONTINUE EXISTING LICENSES OR

LEASES UPON COMPLETING SPECIFIED WORK. IN GENERAL, THESE LICENSE AND LEASE

AGREEMENTS ARE HELD AS LONG AS THERE IS PRODUCTION ON THE LICENSES AND LEASES.

EXPLORATION LICENSES IN OFFSHORE EASTERN CANADA AND THE BEAUFORT SEA ARE HELD

BY WORK COMMITMENTS OF VARIOUS AMOUNTS AND RENTALS. THEY ARE VALID FOR A

MAXIMUM TERM OF NINE YEARS. PRODUCTION LICENSES IN THE OFFSHORE ARE VALID FOR

25 YEARS, WITH RIGHTS OF EXTENSION FOR CONTINUED PRODUCTION. SIGNIFICANT

DISCOVERY LICENSES IN THE OFFSHORE, RELATING TO CURRENTLY UNDEVELOPED

DISCOVERIES, DO NOT HAVE A DEFINITE TERM.

YEARS, DIVIDED INTO THREE POTENTIAL EXPLORATION PERIODS, WITH AN OPTIONAL

EXTENSION FOR UP TO ONE YEAR DEPENDING ON THE CLASSIFICATION OF THE AREA.

PURSUANT TO THE AMENDED LAW, THE PRODUCTION TERM FOR A CONVENTIONAL PRODUCTION

CONCESSION WOULD BE 25 YEARS, AND 35 YEARS FOR AN UNCONVENTIONAL CONCESSION,

WITH UNLIMITED TEN-YEAR EXTENSIONS POSSIBLE, ONCE A FIELD HAS BEEN DEVELOPED.

NETHERLANDS

UNDER THE MINING LAW, EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2003,

EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION LICENSES FOR BOTH ONSHORE AND OFFSHORE AREAS ARE

ISSUED FOR A PERIOD AS EXPLICITLY DEFINED IN THE LICENSE. THE TERM IS BASED ON

THE PERIOD OF TIME NECESSARY TO PERFORM THE ACTIVITIES FOR WHICH THE LICENSE IS

ISSUED. LICENSE CONDITIONS ARE STIPULATED IN THE LICENSE AND ARE BASED ON THE

MINING LAW.

PRODUCTION RIGHTS GRANTED PRIOR TO JANUARY 1, 2003, REMAIN

SUBJECT TO THEIR EXISTING TERMS, AND DIFFER SLIGHTLY FOR ONSHORE AND OFFSHORE

AREAS. ONSHORE PRODUCTION LICENSES ISSUED PRIOR TO 1988 WERE INDEFINITE; FROM

1988 THEY WERE ISSUED FOR A PERIOD AS EXPLICITLY DEFINED IN THE LICENSE,

RANGING FROM 35 TO 45 YEARS. OFFSHORE PRODUCTION LICENSES ISSUED BEFORE 1976

WERE ISSUED FOR A FIXED PERIOD OF 40 YEARS; FROM 1976 THEY WERE AGAIN ISSUED

FOR A PERIOD AS EXPLICITLY DEFINED IN THE LICENSE, RANGING FROM 15 TO 40 YEARS.

NORWAY

INITIAL PERIOD OF ONE YEAR AT A TIME UP TO TEN YEARS AFTER 1985), AND AN

EXTENSION PERIOD OF UP TO 30 YEARS, WITH RELINQUISHMENT OF AT LEAST ONE-HALF OF

WITH RELINQUISHMENT OF AT LEAST ONE-HALF OF THE ORIGINAL AREA REQUIRED AT THE

END OF THE INITIAL PERIOD.

UNITED

KINGDOM

ACREAGE TERMS ARE FIXED BY THE GOVERNMENT AND ARE

PERIODICALLY CHANGED. FOR EXAMPLE, MANY OF THE EARLY LICENSES ISSUED UNDER THE

FIRST FOUR LICENSING ROUNDS PROVIDED FOR AN INITIAL TERM OF SIX YEARS WITH

RELINQUISHMENT OF AT LEAST ONE-HALF OF THE ORIGINAL AREA AT THE END OF THE

INITIAL TERM, SUBJECT TO EXTENSION FOR A FURTHER 40 YEARS. AT THE END OF ANY

SUCH 40-YEAR TERM, LICENSES MAY CONTINUE IN PRODUCING AREAS UNTIL CESSATION OF

PRODUCTION; OR LICENSES MAY CONTINUE IN DEVELOPMENT AREAS FOR PERIODS AGREED ON

A CASE-BY-CASE BASIS UNTIL THEY BECOME PRODUCING AREAS; OR LICENSES TERMINATE

IN ALL OTHER AREAS. THE LICENSING REGIME WAS LAST UPDATED IN 2002, AND THE

MAJORITY OF LICENSES ISSUED HAVE AN INITIAL TERM OF FOUR YEARS WITH A SECOND

TERM EXTENSION OF FOUR YEARS AND A FINAL TERM OF 18 YEARS WITH A MANDATORY

RELINQUISHMENT OF 50 PERCENT OF THE ACREAGE AFTER THE INITIAL TERM AND OF ALL

ACREAGE THAT IS NOT COVERED BY A DEVELOPMENT PLAN AT THE END OF THE SECOND TERM.

AFRICA

ANGOLA

EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION ACTIVITIES ARE GOVERNED BY

PRODUCTION SHARING AGREEMENTS WITH AN INITIAL EXPLORATION TERM OF FOUR YEARS

AND AN OPTIONAL SECOND PHASE OF TWO TO THREE YEARS. THE PRODUCTION PERIOD IS

UP TO 50 YEARS AT THE DISCRETION OF THE GOVERNMENT.

EQUATORIAL GUINEA

EXPLORATION, DEVELOPMENT AND PRODUCTION ACTIVITIES ARE

GOVERNED BY PRODUCTION SHARING CONTRACTS (PSCS) NEGOTIATED WITH THE STATE

MINISTRY OF MINES, INDUSTRY AND ENERGY. A NEW PSC WAS SIGNED IN 2015; THE

INITIAL EXPLORATION PERIOD IS FIVE YEARS FOR OIL AND GAS, WITH MULTI-YEAR

EXTENSIONS AVAILABLE AT THE DISCRETION OF THE MINISTRY AND LIMITED

RELINQUISHMENTS IN THE ABSENCE OF COMMERCIAL DISCOVERIES. THE PRODUCTION PERIOD

FOR CRUDE OIL RANGES FROM 25 TO 30 YEARS, WHILE THE PRODUCTION PERIOD FOR

NATURAL GAS RANGES FROM 25 TO 50 YEARS.

NIGERIA

EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION ACTIVITIES IN THE DEEPWATER

OFFSHORE AREAS ARE TYPICALLY GOVERNED BY PRODUCTION SHARING CONTRACTS (PSCS)

WITH THE NATIONAL OIL COMPANY, THE NIGERIAN NATIONAL PETROLEUM CORPORATION

(NNPC). NNPC TYPICALLY HOLDS THE UNDERLYING OIL PROSPECTING LICENSE (OPL) AND

ANY RESULTING OIL MINING LEASE (OML). THE TERMS OF THE PSCS ARE GENERALLY 30

YEARS, INCLUDING A TEN-YEAR EXPLORATION PERIOD (AN INITIAL EXPLORATION PHASE

THAT CAN BE DIVIDED INTO MULTIPLE OPTIONAL PERIODS) COVERED BY AN OPL. UPON

COMMERCIAL DISCOVERY, AN OPL MAY BE CONVERTED TO AN OML. PARTIAL RELINQUISHMENT

IS REQUIRED UNDER THE PSC AT THE END OF THE TEN-YEAR EXPLORATION PERIOD, AND

OMLS HAVE A 20-YEAR PRODUCTION PERIOD THAT MAY BE EXTENDED.

SOME EXPLORATION ACTIVITIES ARE CARRIED OUT IN DEEPWATER BY

JOINT VENTURES WITH LOCAL COMPANIES HOLDING INTERESTS IN AN OPL. OPLS IN

DEEPWATER OFFSHORE AREAS ARE VALID FOR TEN YEARS, WHILE IN ALL OTHER AREAS THE

LICENSES ARE FOR FIVE YEARS. DEMONSTRATING A COMMERCIAL DISCOVERY IS THE BASIS

FOR CONVERSION OF AN OPL TO AN OML.

OMLS GRANTED PRIOR TO THE 1969 PETROLEUM ACT (I.E., UNDER

THE MINERAL OILS ACT 1914, REPEALED BY THE 1969 PETROLEUM ACT) WERE FOR 30

YEARS ONSHORE AND 40 YEARS IN OFFSHORE AREAS AND HAVE BEEN RENEWED, EFFECTIVE

DECEMBER 1, 2008, FOR A FURTHER PERIOD OF 20 YEARS, WITH A FURTHER RENEWAL

OPTION OF 20 YEARS. OPERATIONS UNDER THESE PRE-1969 OMLS ARE CONDUCTED UNDER A

JOINT VENTURE AGREEMENT WITH NNPC RATHER THAN A PSC. COMMERCIAL TERMS

APPLICABLE TO THE EXISTING JOINT VENTURE OIL PRODUCTION ARE DEFINED BY THE

PETROLEUM PROFITS TAX ACT.

OMLS GRANTED UNDER THE 1969 PETROLEUM ACT, WHICH INCLUDE

ALL DEEPWATER OMLS, HAVE A MAXIMUM TERM OF 20 YEARS WITHOUT DISTINCTION FOR

ONSHORE OR OFFSHORE LOCATION AND ARE RENEWABLE, UPON 12 MONTHS’ WRITTEN NOTICE,

FOR ANOTHER PERIOD OF 20 YEARS. OMLS NOT HELD BY NNPC ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO A

MANDATORY 50-PERCENT RELINQUISHMENT AFTER THE FIRST TEN YEARS OF THEIR DURATION.

ESTABLISHED IN 2002 TO MANAGE UPSTREAM OIL AND GAS ACTIVITIES. IN 2012,

INDONESIA’S CONSTITUTIONAL COURT RULED CERTAIN ARTICLES OF LAW RELATING TO

BPMIGAS TO BE UNCONSTITUTIONAL, BUT STATED THAT ALL EXISTING PSCS SIGNED WITH

BPMIGAS SHOULD REMAIN IN FORCE UNTIL THEIR EXPIRY, AND THE FUNCTIONS AND DUTIES

PREVIOUSLY PERFORMED BY BPMIGAS ARE TO BE CARRIED OUT BY THE RELEVANT MINISTRY

OF THE GOVERNMENT OF INDONESIA UNTIL THE PROMULGATION OF A NEW OIL AND GAS LAW.

BY PRESIDENTIAL DECREE, SKKMIGAS BECAME THE INTERIM SUCCESSOR TO BPMIGAS. THE

CURRENT PSCS HAVE AN EXPLORATION PERIOD OF SIX YEARS, WHICH CAN BE EXTENDED UP

TO 10 YEARS, AND AN EXPLOITATION PERIOD OF 20 YEARS. PSCS GENERALLY REQUIRE THE

CONTRACTOR TO RELINQUISH 10 PERCENT TO 20 PERCENT OF THE CONTRACT AREA AFTER

THREE YEARS AND GENERALLY ALLOW THE CONTRACTOR TO RETAIN NO MORE THAN 50

PERCENT TO 80 PERCENT OF THE ORIGINAL CONTRACT AREA AFTER SIX YEARS, DEPENDING

ON THE ACREAGE AND TERMS.

FREQUENTLY USED TERMS

LISTED BELOW ARE DEFINITIONS OF SEVERAL OF

EXXONMOBIL’S KEY BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE MEASURES. THESE DEFINITIONS

ARE PROVIDED TO FACILITATE UNDERSTANDING OF THE TERMS AND THEIR CALCULATION.

CASH FLOW FROM OPERATIONS AND ASSET SALES

CASH

FLOW FROM OPERATIONS AND ASSET SALES IS THE SUM OF THE NET CASH PROVIDED BY

OPERATING ACTIVITIES AND PROCEEDS ASSOCIATED WITH SALES OF SUBSIDIARIES,

PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT, AND SALES AND RETURNS OF INVESTMENTS FROM THE

CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS. THIS CASH FLOW REFLECTS THE TOTAL SOURCES

OF CASH FROM BOTH OPERATING THE CORPORATION’S ASSETS AND FROM THE DIVESTING OF

ASSETS. THE CORPORATION EMPLOYS A LONG-STANDING AND REGULAR DISCIPLINED REVIEW

PROCESS TO ENSURE THAT ALL ASSETS ARE CONTRIBUTING TO THE CORPORATION’S

STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES. ASSETS ARE DIVESTED WHEN THEY ARE NO LONGER MEETING THESE

OBJECTIVES OR ARE WORTH CONSIDERABLY MORE TO OTHERS. BECAUSE OF THE REGULAR

NATURE OF THIS ACTIVITY, WE BELIEVE IT IS USEFUL FOR INVESTORS TO CONSIDER

PROCEEDS ASSOCIATED WITH ASSET SALES TOGETHER WITH CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING

ACTIVITIES WHEN EVALUATING CASH AVAILABLE FOR INVESTMENT IN THE BUSINESS AND

FINANCING ACTIVITIES, INCLUDING SHAREHOLDER DISTRIBUTIONS.

AVERAGE CAPITAL EMPLOYED

RETURN

ON AVERAGE CAPITAL EMPLOYED (ROCE) IS A PERFORMANCE MEASURE RATIO. FROM THE

PERSPECTIVE OF THE BUSINESS SEGMENTS, ROCE IS ANNUAL BUSINESS SEGMENT EARNINGS

DIVIDED BY AVERAGE BUSINESS SEGMENT CAPITAL EMPLOYED (AVERAGE OF BEGINNING AND

END-OF-YEAR AMOUNTS). THESE SEGMENT EARNINGS INCLUDE EXXONMOBIL’S SHARE OF

SEGMENT EARNINGS OF EQUITY COMPANIES, CONSISTENT WITH OUR CAPITAL EMPLOYED

DEFINITION, AND EXCLUDE THE COST OF FINANCING. THE CORPORATION’S TOTAL ROCE IS

NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO EXXONMOBIL EXCLUDING THE AFTER-TAX COST OF

FINANCING, DIVIDED BY TOTAL CORPORATE AVERAGE CAPITAL EMPLOYED. THE CORPORATION

HAS CONSISTENTLY APPLIED ITS ROCE DEFINITION FOR MANY YEARS AND VIEWS IT AS THE

BEST MEASURE OF HISTORICAL CAPITAL PRODUCTIVITY IN OUR CAPITAL-INTENSIVE,

LONG-TERM INDUSTRY, BOTH TO EVALUATE MANAGEMENT’S PERFORMANCE AND TO

DEMONSTRATE TO SHAREHOLDERS THAT CAPITAL HAS BEEN USED WISELY OVER THE LONG

TERM. ADDITIONAL MEASURES, WHICH ARE MORE CASH FLOW BASED, ARE USED TO MAKE

INVESTMENT DECISIONS.

OVERVIEW

THE

FOLLOWING DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF EXXONMOBIL’S FINANCIAL RESULTS, AS WELL AS

THE ACCOMPANYING FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND RELATED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS TO WHICH THEY REFER, ARE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE

MANAGEMENT OF EXXON MOBIL CORPORATION. THE CORPORATION’S ACCOUNTING AND

FINANCIAL REPORTING FAIRLY REFLECT ITS STRAIGHTFORWARD BUSINESS MODEL INVOLVING

THE EXTRACTING, MANUFACTURING AND MARKETING OF HYDROCARBONS AND

HYDROCARBON-BASED PRODUCTS. THE CORPORATION’S BUSINESS MODEL INVOLVES THE

PRODUCTION (OR PURCHASE), MANUFACTURE AND SALE OF PHYSICAL PRODUCTS, AND ALL

COMMERCIAL ACTIVITIES ARE DIRECTLY IN SUPPORT OF THE UNDERLYING PHYSICAL

MOVEMENT OF GOODS.

EXXONMOBIL,

WITH ITS RESOURCE BASE, FINANCIAL STRENGTH, DISCIPLINED INVESTMENT APPROACH AND

TECHNOLOGY PORTFOLIO, IS WELL-POSITIONED TO PARTICIPATE IN SUBSTANTIAL

INVESTMENTS TO DEVELOP NEW ENERGY SUPPLIES. THE COMPANY’S INTEGRATED BUSINESS

MODEL, WITH SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS IN UPSTREAM, DOWNSTREAM AND CHEMICAL

SEGMENTS, REDUCES THE CORPORATION’S RISK FROM CHANGES IN COMMODITY PRICES. WHILE

COMMODITY PRICES ARE VOLATILE ON A SHORT-TERM BASIS AND DEPEND ON SUPPLY AND

DEMAND, EXXONMOBIL’S INVESTMENT DECISIONS ARE BASED ON OUR LONG-TERM BUSINESS

OUTLOOK, USING A DISCIPLINED APPROACH IN SELECTING AND PURSUING THE MOST

ATTRACTIVE INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES. THE CORPORATE PLAN IS A FUNDAMENTAL ANNUAL

MANAGEMENT PROCESS THAT IS THE BASIS FOR SETTING NEAR-TERM OPERATING AND

CAPITAL OBJECTIVES IN ADDITION TO PROVIDING THE LONGER-TERM ECONOMIC

ASSUMPTIONS USED FOR INVESTMENT EVALUATION PURPOSES. VOLUMES ARE BASED ON

INDIVIDUAL FIELD PRODUCTION PROFILES, WHICH ARE ALSO UPDATED ANNUALLY. PRICE

RANGES FOR CRUDE OIL, NATURAL GAS, REFINED PRODUCTS, AND CHEMICAL PRODUCTS ARE

BASED ON CORPORATE PLAN ASSUMPTIONS DEVELOPED ANNUALLY BY MAJOR REGION AND ARE

UTILIZED FOR INVESTMENT EVALUATION PURPOSES. POTENTIAL INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES

ARE EVALUATED OVER A WIDE RANGE OF ECONOMIC SCENARIOS TO ESTABLISH THE

RESILIENCY OF EACH OPPORTUNITY. ONCE INVESTMENTS ARE MADE, A REAPPRAISAL

PROCESS IS COMPLETED TO ENSURE RELEVANT LESSONS ARE LEARNED AND IMPROVEMENTS

ARE INCORPORATED INTO FUTURE PROJECTS.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

BUSINESS

ENVIRONMENT AND RISK ASSESSMENT

LONG-TERM BUSINESS OUTLOOK

BY

2040, THE WORLD’S POPULATION IS PROJECTED TO GROW TO APPROXIMATELY 9 BILLION

PEOPLE, OR ABOUT 1.8 BILLION MORE THAN IN 2014. COINCIDENT WITH THIS

POPULATION INCREASE, THE CORPORATION EXPECTS WORLDWIDE ECONOMIC GROWTH TO

AVERAGE CLOSE TO 3 PERCENT PER YEAR. AS ECONOMIES AND POPULATIONS GROW,

AND AS LIVING STANDARDS IMPROVE FOR BILLIONS OF PEOPLE, THE NEED FOR ENERGY

WILL CONTINUE TO RISE. EVEN WITH SIGNIFICANT EFFICIENCY GAINS, GLOBAL ENERGY

DEMAND IS PROJECTED TO RISE BY ABOUT 25 PERCENT FROM 2014 TO 2040. THIS

DEMAND INCREASE IS EXPECTED TO BE CONCENTRATED IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES (I.E.,

THOSE THAT ARE NOT MEMBER NATIONS OF THE ORGANISATION FOR ECONOMIC CO‐OPERATION

AND DEVELOPMENT).

AS

EXPANDING PROSPERITY DRIVES GLOBAL ENERGY DEMAND HIGHER, INCREASING USE OF

ENERGY‐EFFICIENT AND LOWER‐EMISSION FUELS, TECHNOLOGIES AND

PRACTICES WILL CONTINUE TO HELP SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE ENERGY CONSUMPTION AND

EMISSIONS PER UNIT OF ECONOMIC OUTPUT OVER TIME. SUBSTANTIAL EFFICIENCY GAINS

ARE LIKELY IN ALL KEY ASPECTS OF THE WORLD’S ECONOMY THROUGH 2040, AFFECTING

ENERGY REQUIREMENTS FOR TRANSPORTATION, POWER GENERATION, INDUSTRIAL

APPLICATIONS, AND RESIDENTIAL AND COMMERCIAL NEEDS.

ENERGY

FOR TRANSPORTATION – INCLUDING CARS, TRUCKS, SHIPS, TRAINS AND AIRPLANES – IS

EXPECTED TO INCREASE BY ABOUT 30 PERCENT FROM 2014 TO 2040. THE GROWTH IN

TRANSPORTATION ENERGY DEMAND IS LIKELY TO ACCOUNT FOR APPROXIMATELY 60 PERCENT

OF THE GROWTH IN LIQUID FUELS DEMAND WORLDWIDE OVER THIS PERIOD. NEARLY ALL THE

WORLD’S TRANSPORTATION FLEETS WILL CONTINUE TO RUN ON LIQUID FUELS, WHICH ARE

ABUNDANT, WIDELY AVAILABLE, EASY TO TRANSPORT, AND PROVIDE A LARGE QUANTITY OF

ENERGY IN SMALL VOLUMES.

DEMAND

FOR ELECTRICITY AROUND THE WORLD IS LIKELY TO INCREASE APPROXIMATELY

65 PERCENT FROM 2014 TO 2040, LED BY GROWTH IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES.

CONSISTENT WITH THIS PROJECTION, POWER GENERATION IS EXPECTED TO REMAIN THE

LARGEST AND FASTEST‐GROWING MAJOR SEGMENT OF GLOBAL ENERGY DEMAND.

MEETING THE EXPECTED GROWTH IN POWER DEMAND WILL REQUIRE A DIVERSE SET OF

ENERGY SOURCES. TODAY, COAL‐FIRED GENERATION PROVIDES ABOUT 40 PERCENT

OF THE WORLD’S ELECTRICITY, BUT BY 2040 ITS SHARE IS LIKELY TO DECLINE TO ABOUT

30 PERCENT, IN PART AS A RESULT OF POLICIES TO IMPROVE AIR QUALITY AND

REDUCE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS AND THE RISKS OF CLIMATE CHANGE. FROM 2014 TO

2040, THE AMOUNT OF ELECTRICITY GENERATED USING NATURAL GAS, NUCLEAR POWER, AND

RENEWABLES ARE ALL LIKELY TO DOUBLE. BY 2040, COAL, NATURAL GAS AND RENEWABLES

ARE PROJECTED TO BE GENERATING APPROXIMATELY THE SAME SHARE OF ELECTRICITY

WORLDWIDE, ALTHOUGH SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES WILL EXIST ACROSS REGIONS

REFLECTING A WIDE RANGE OF FACTORS INCLUDING THE COST AND AVAILABILITY OF

ENERGY TYPES.

LIQUID

FUELS PROVIDE THE LARGEST SHARE OF GLOBAL ENERGY SUPPLIES TODAY DUE TO THEIR

BROAD-BASED AVAILABILITY, AFFORDABILITY AND EASE OF TRANSPORTATION,

DISTRIBUTION AND STORAGE TO MEET CONSUMER NEEDS. BY 2040, GLOBAL DEMAND FOR

LIQUID FUELS IS PROJECTED TO GROW TO APPROXIMATELY 112 MILLION BARRELS OF

OIL‐EQUIVALENT PER DAY, AN INCREASE OF ABOUT 20 PERCENT FROM 2014.

GLOBALLY, CRUDE PRODUCTION FROM TRADITIONAL CONVENTIONAL SOURCES WILL LIKELY

DECREASE SLIGHTLY THROUGH 2040, WITH SIGNIFICANT DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITY MOSTLY

OFFSETTING NATURAL DECLINES FROM THESE FIELDS. HOWEVER, THIS DECREASE IS

EXPECTED TO BE MORE THAN OFFSET BY RISING PRODUCTION FROM A VARIETY OF EMERGING

SUPPLY SOURCES – INCLUDING TIGHT OIL, DEEPWATER, OIL SANDS, NATURAL GAS LIQUIDS

AND BIOFUELS. THE WORLD’S RESOURCE BASE IS SUFFICIENT TO MEET PROJECTED DEMAND

THROUGH 2040 AS TECHNOLOGY ADVANCES CONTINUE TO EXPAND THE AVAILABILITY OF

ECONOMIC SUPPLY OPTIONS. HOWEVER, ACCESS TO RESOURCES AND TIMELY INVESTMENTS

WILL REMAIN CRITICAL TO MEETING GLOBAL NEEDS WITH RELIABLE, AFFORDABLE SUPPLIES.

NATURAL

GAS IS A VERSATILE FUEL, SUITABLE FOR A WIDE VARIETY OF APPLICATIONS, AND IT IS

EXPECTED TO BE THE FASTEST-GROWING MAJOR FUEL SOURCE FROM 2014 TO 2040, MEETING

ABOUT 40 PERCENT OF GLOBAL ENERGY DEMAND GROWTH. GLOBAL NATURAL GAS DEMAND

IS EXPECTED TO RISE ABOUT 50 PERCENT FROM 2014 TO 2040, WITH ABOUT

45 PERCENT OF THAT INCREASE IN THE ASIA PACIFIC REGION. HELPING MEET THESE

NEEDS WILL BE SIGNIFICANT GROWTH IN SUPPLIES OF UNCONVENTIONAL GAS ‐ THE

NATURAL GAS FOUND IN SHALE AND OTHER ROCK FORMATIONS THAT WAS ONCE CONSIDERED

UNECONOMIC TO PRODUCE. IN TOTAL, ABOUT 60 PERCENT OF THE GROWTH IN NATURAL

GAS SUPPLIES IS EXPECTED TO BE FROM UNCONVENTIONAL SOURCES. HOWEVER, WE EXPECT

CONVENTIONALLY-PRODUCED NATURAL GAS TO REMAIN THE CORNERSTONE OF SUPPLY,

MEETING ABOUT TWO‐THIRDS OF GLOBAL DEMAND IN 2040. THE WORLDWIDE

LIQUEFIED NATURAL GAS (LNG) MARKET IS EXPECTED TO ALMOST TRIPLE BY 2040, WITH

MUCH OF THIS SUPPLY EXPECTED TO MEET RISING DEMAND IN ASIA PACIFIC.

THE

WORLD’S ENERGY MIX IS HIGHLY DIVERSE AND WILL REMAIN SO THROUGH 2040. OIL IS

EXPECTED TO REMAIN THE LARGEST SOURCE OF ENERGY WITH ITS SHARE REMAINING CLOSE

TO ONE‐THIRD IN 2040. COAL IS CURRENTLY THE SECOND LARGEST SOURCE OF

ENERGY, BUT IT IS LIKELY TO LOSE THAT POSITION TO NATURAL GAS IN THE 2025‐2030

TIMEFRAME. THE SHARE OF NATURAL GAS IS EXPECTED TO EXCEED 25 PERCENT BY

2040, WHILE THE SHARE OF COAL FALLS TO ABOUT 20 PERCENT. NUCLEAR POWER IS

PROJECTED TO GROW SIGNIFICANTLY, AS MANY NATIONS ARE LIKELY TO EXPAND NUCLEAR

CAPACITY TO ADDRESS RISING ELECTRICITY NEEDS AS WELL AS ENERGY SECURITY AND

ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES. TOTAL RENEWABLE ENERGY IS LIKELY TO REACH ABOUT

15 PERCENT OF TOTAL ENERGY BY 2040, WITH BIOMASS, HYDRO AND GEOTHERMAL

CONTRIBUTING A COMBINED SHARE OF MORE THAN 10 PERCENT. TOTAL ENERGY SUPPLIED

FROM WIND, SOLAR AND BIOFUELS IS EXPECTED TO INCREASE RAPIDLY, GROWING CLOSE TO

250 PERCENT FROM 2014 TO 2040, WHEN THEY WILL BE APPROACHING

4 PERCENT OF WORLD ENERGY.

THE

CORPORATION ANTICIPATES THAT THE WORLD’S AVAILABLE OIL AND GAS RESOURCE BASE

WILL GROW NOT ONLY FROM NEW DISCOVERIES, BUT ALSO FROM RESERVE INCREASES IN

PREVIOUSLY DISCOVERED FIELDS. TECHNOLOGY WILL UNDERPIN THESE INCREASES. THE

COST TO DEVELOP AND SUPPLY THESE RESOURCES WILL BE SIGNIFICANT. ACCORDING TO

THE INTERNATIONAL ENERGY AGENCY, THE INVESTMENT REQUIRED TO MEET OIL AND

NATURAL

41

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

GAS SUPPLY REQUIREMENTS WORLDWIDE OVER THE

PERIOD 2015‐2040 WILL BE ABOUT $25 TRILLION (MEASURED IN 2014

DOLLARS) OR APPROXIMATELY $1 TRILLION PER YEAR ON AVERAGE.

INTERNATIONAL

ACCORDS AND UNDERLYING REGIONAL AND NATIONAL REGULATIONS COVERING GREENHOUSE

GAS EMISSIONS CONTINUE TO EVOLVE WITH UNCERTAIN TIMING AND OUTCOME, MAKING IT

DIFFICULT TO PREDICT THEIR BUSINESS IMPACT. FOR MANY YEARS, THE CORPORATION HAS

TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT POLICIES ESTABLISHED TO REDUCE ENERGY‐RELATED

GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS IN ITS LONG-TERM

OUTLOOK FOR ENERGY

, WHICH IS

USED AS A FOUNDATION FOR ASSESSING THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT AND BUSINESS

STRATEGIES AND INVESTMENTS. THE CLIMATE ACCORD REACHED AT THE RECENT CONFERENCE

OF THE PARTIES (COP 21) IN PARIS SET MANY NEW GOALS, AND WHILE MANY

RELATED POLICIES ARE STILL EMERGING, THE

OUTLOOK FOR ENERGY

CONTINUES TO

ANTICIPATE THAT SUCH POLICIES WILL INCREASE THE COST OF CARBON DIOXIDE EMISSIONS

OVER TIME. FOR PURPOSES OF THE

OUTLOOK FOR ENERGY

, WE CONTINUE TO ASSUME

THAT GOVERNMENTS WILL ENACT POLICIES THAT IMPOSE RISING COSTS ON ENERGY‐RELATED

CO

2

EMISSIONS, WHICH WE ASSUME WILL REACH AN IMPLIED COST IN OECD NATIONS

OF ABOUT $80 PER TONNE IN 2040. CHINA AND OTHER LEADING NON‐OECD

NATIONS ARE EXPECTED TO TRAIL OECD POLICY INITIATIVES. NEVERTHELESS, AS PEOPLE AND

NATIONS LOOK FOR WAYS TO REDUCE RISKS OF GLOBAL CLIMATE CHANGE, THEY WILL

CONTINUE TO NEED PRACTICAL SOLUTIONS THAT DO NOT JEOPARDIZE THE AFFORDABILITY

OR RELIABILITY OF THE ENERGY THEY NEED. THUS, ALL PRACTICAL AND ECONOMICALLY

VIABLE ENERGY SOURCES, BOTH CONVENTIONAL AND UNCONVENTIONAL, WILL BE NEEDED TO

CONTINUE MEETING GLOBAL ENERGY NEEDS – BECAUSE OF THE SCALE OF WORLDWIDE ENERGY

DEMAND.

THE

INFORMATION PROVIDED IN THE LONG‐TERM BUSINESS OUTLOOK INCLUDES

EXXONMOBIL’S INTERNAL ESTIMATES AND FORECASTS BASED UPON INTERNAL DATA AND

ANALYSES AS WELL AS PUBLICLY AVAILABLE INFORMATION FROM EXTERNAL SOURCES

INCLUDING THE INTERNATIONAL ENERGY AGENCY.

UPSTREAM

EXXONMOBIL

CONTINUES TO MAINTAIN A DIVERSE PORTFOLIO OF EXPLORATION AND DEVELOPMENT

OPPORTUNITIES, WHICH ENABLES THE CORPORATION TO BE SELECTIVE, MAXIMIZING

SHAREHOLDER VALUE AND MITIGATING POLITICAL AND TECHNICAL RISKS. EXXONMOBIL’S

FUNDAMENTAL UPSTREAM BUSINESS STRATEGIES GUIDE OUR GLOBAL EXPLORATION,

DEVELOPMENT, PRODUCTION, AND GAS AND POWER MARKETING ACTIVITIES. THESE

STRATEGIES INCLUDE CAPTURING MATERIAL AND ACCRETIVE OPPORTUNITIES TO

CONTINUALLY HIGH-GRADE THE RESOURCE PORTFOLIO, EXERCISING A DISCIPLINED

APPROACH TO INVESTING AND COST MANAGEMENT, DEVELOPING AND APPLYING HIGH-IMPACT

TECHNOLOGIES, PURSUING PRODUCTIVITY AND EFFICIENCY GAINS, GROWING PROFITABLE

OIL AND GAS PRODUCTION, AND CAPITALIZING ON GROWING NATURAL GAS AND POWER

MARKETS. THESE STRATEGIES ARE UNDERPINNED BY A RELENTLESS FOCUS ON OPERATIONAL

EXCELLENCE, COMMITMENT TO INNOVATIVE TECHNOLOGIES, DEVELOPMENT OF OUR

EMPLOYEES, AND INVESTMENT IN THE COMMUNITIES WITHIN WHICH WE OPERATE.

AS

FUTURE DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS AND DRILLING ACTIVITIES BRING NEW PRODUCTION

ONLINE, THE CORPORATION EXPECTS A SHIFT IN THE GEOGRAPHIC MIX AND IN THE TYPE

OF OPPORTUNITIES FROM WHICH VOLUMES ARE PRODUCED. OIL EQUIVALENT PRODUCTION

FROM NORTH AMERICA IS EXPECTED TO INCREASE OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS BASED ON

CURRENT CAPITAL ACTIVITY PLANS, CONTRIBUTING OVER A THIRD OF TOTAL PRODUCTION. FURTHER,

THE PROPORTION OF OUR GLOBAL PRODUCTION FROM RESOURCE TYPES UTILIZING

SPECIALIZED TECHNOLOGIES SUCH AS ARCTIC, DEEPWATER, AND UNCONVENTIONAL DRILLING

AND PRODUCTION SYSTEMS, AS WELL AS LNG, IS ALSO EXPECTED TO GROW, BECOMING A

SLIGHT MAJORITY OF PRODUCTION IN THE NEXT FEW YEARS. WE DO NOT ANTICIPATE THAT

THE EXPECTED CHANGE IN THE GEOGRAPHIC MIX OF PRODUCTION VOLUMES, AND IN THE

TYPES OF OPPORTUNITIES FROM WHICH VOLUMES WILL BE PRODUCED, WILL HAVE A

MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE NATURE AND THE EXTENT OF THE RISKS DISCLOSED IN ITEM 1A.

RISK FACTORS, OR RESULT IN A MATERIAL CHANGE IN OUR LEVEL OF UNIT OPERATING

EXPENSES.

THE

CORPORATION ANTICIPATES SEVERAL PROJECTS WILL COME ONLINE OVER THE NEXT FEW

YEARS PROVIDING ADDITIONAL PRODUCTION CAPACITY. HOWEVER, ACTUAL VOLUMES WILL

VARY FROM YEAR TO YEAR DUE TO THE TIMING OF INDIVIDUAL PROJECT START-UPS;

OPERATIONAL OUTAGES; RESERVOIR PERFORMANCE; PERFORMANCE OF ENHANCED OIL RECOVERY

PROJECTS; REGULATORY CHANGES; THE IMPACT OF FISCAL AND COMMERCIAL TERMS; ASSET

SALES; WEATHER EVENTS; PRICE EFFECTS ON PRODUCTION SHARING CONTRACTS; CHANGES

IN THE AMOUNT AND TIMING OF CAPITAL INVESTMENTS THAT MAY VARY DEPENDING ON THE

OIL AND GAS PRICE ENVIRONMENT; AND OTHER FACTORS DESCRIBED IN ITEM 1A. RISK

FACTORS.

THE

UPSTREAM INDUSTRY ENVIRONMENT HAS BEEN CHALLENGED THROUGHOUT 2015 WITH ABUNDANT

CRUDE OIL SUPPLY CAUSING CRUDE OIL PRICES TO DECREASE TO LEVELS NOT SEEN SINCE

2004, WHILE NATURAL GAS PRICES REMAINED DEPRESSED. HOWEVER, CURRENT MARKET CONDITIONS

ARE NOT NECESSARILY INDICATIVE OF FUTURE CONDITIONS. THE MARKETS FOR CRUDE

OIL AND NATURAL GAS HAVE A HISTORY OF SIGNIFICANT PRICE

VOLATILITY. EXXONMOBIL BELIEVES PRICES OVER THE LONG TERM WILL CONTINUE TO

BE DRIVEN BY MARKET SUPPLY AND DEMAND, WITH THE DEMAND SIDE LARGELY BEING A

FUNCTION OF GLOBAL ECONOMIC GROWTH. ON THE SUPPLY SIDE, PRICES MAY BE

SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACTED BY POLITICAL EVENTS, THE ACTIONS OF OPEC AND OTHER LARGE

GOVERNMENT RESOURCE OWNERS, AND OTHER FACTORS. TO MANAGE THE RISKS ASSOCIATED

WITH PRICE, EXXONMOBIL EVALUATES ANNUAL PLANS AND ALL INVESTMENTS ACROSS A WIDE

RANGE OF PRICE SCENARIOS. THE CORPORATION’S ASSESSMENT IS THAT ITS OPERATIONS

WILL EXHIBIT STRONG PERFORMANCE OVER THE LONG TERM. THIS IS THE OUTCOME OF

DISCIPLINED INVESTMENT, COST MANAGEMENT, ASSET ENHANCEMENT PROGRAMS, AND

APPLICATION OF ADVANCED TECHNOLOGIES.

DOWNSTREAM

EXXONMOBIL’S

DOWNSTREAM IS A LARGE, DIVERSIFIED BUSINESS WITH REFINING, LOGISTICS, AND

MARKETING COMPLEXES AROUND THE WORLD. THE CORPORATION HAS A PRESENCE IN MATURE

MARKETS IN NORTH AMERICA AND EUROPE, AS WELL AS IN THE GROWING ASIA PACIFIC

REGION.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

EXXONMOBIL’S FUNDAMENTAL DOWNSTREAM

BUSINESS STRATEGIES COMPETITIVELY POSITION THE COMPANY ACROSS A RANGE OF MARKET

CONDITIONS. THESE STRATEGIES INCLUDE TARGETING BEST‐IN‐CLASS

OPERATIONS IN ALL ASPECTS OF THE BUSINESS, MAXIMIZING VALUE FROM ADVANCED

TECHNOLOGIES, CAPITALIZING ON INTEGRATION ACROSS EXXONMOBIL BUSINESSES,

SELECTIVELY INVESTING FOR RESILIENT, ADVANTAGED RETURNS, OPERATING EFFICIENTLY

AND EFFECTIVELY, AND PROVIDING QUALITY, VALUED AND DIFFERENTIATED PRODUCTS AND

SERVICES TO CUSTOMERS.

EXXONMOBIL’S

OPERATING RESULTS, AS NOTED IN ITEM 2. PROPERTIES, REFLECT 23 REFINERIES,

LOCATED IN 14 COUNTRIES, WITH DISTILLATION CAPACITY OF 5 MILLION

BARRELS PER DAY AND LUBRICANT BASESTOCK MANUFACTURING CAPACITY OF 136 THOUSAND

BARRELS PER DAY. EXXONMOBIL’S FUELS AND LUBES MARKETING BUSINESSES HAVE

SIGNIFICANT GLOBAL REACH, WITH MULTIPLE CHANNELS TO MARKET SERVING A DIVERSE

CUSTOMER BASE. OUR PORTFOLIO OF WORLD-RENOWNED BRANDS INCLUDES

EXXON

,

MOBIL

,

ESSO

AND

MOBIL 1.

THE

DOWNSTREAM INDUSTRY ENVIRONMENT IMPROVED IN 2015. GROWTH IN GLOBAL DEMAND,

STIMULATED BY LOWER PRICES FOR CRUDE OIL AND TRANSPORTATION FUELS, RESULTED IN

HIGHER REFINERY UTILIZATION AND MARGINS, PARTICULARLY IN EUROPE AND ASIA

PACIFIC. REFINERIES IN NORTH AMERICA CONTINUE TO BENEFIT FROM LOWER RAW

MATERIAL AND ENERGY COSTS DUE TO THE ABUNDANT SUPPLY OF CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS.

IN THE NEAR TERM, WE SEE VARIABILITY IN REFINING MARGINS, WITH SOME REGIONS

SEEING WEAKER MARGINS AS NEW CAPACITY ADDITIONS ARE EXPECTED TO OUTPACE GROWTH

IN GLOBAL DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS, WHICH CAN ALSO BE AFFECTED BY GLOBAL

ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND REGULATORY CHANGES.

REFINING

MARGINS ARE LARGELY DRIVEN BY DIFFERENCES IN COMMODITY PRICES AND ARE A FUNCTION

OF THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WHAT A REFINERY PAYS FOR ITS RAW MATERIALS (PRIMARILY

CRUDE OIL) AND THE MARKET PRICES FOR THE RANGE OF PRODUCTS PRODUCED (PRIMARILY

GASOLINE, HEATING OIL, DIESEL OIL, JET FUEL AND FUEL OIL). CRUDE OIL AND MANY

PRODUCTS ARE WIDELY TRADED WITH PUBLISHED PRICES, INCLUDING THOSE QUOTED ON

MULTIPLE EXCHANGES AROUND THE WORLD (E.G., NEW YORK MERCANTILE EXCHANGE AND

INTERCONTINENTAL EXCHANGE). PRICES FOR THESE COMMODITIES ARE DETERMINED BY THE

GLOBAL MARKETPLACE AND ARE INFLUENCED BY MANY FACTORS, INCLUDING GLOBAL AND

REGIONAL SUPPLY/DEMAND BALANCES, INVENTORY LEVELS, INDUSTRY REFINERY

OPERATIONS, IMPORT/EXPORT BALANCES, CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS, SEASONAL DEMAND,

WEATHER AND POLITICAL CLIMATE.

EXXONMOBIL’S

LONG‐TERM OUTLOOK IS THAT INDUSTRY REFINING MARGINS WILL REMAIN SUBJECT

TO INTENSE COMPETITION AS NEW CAPACITY ADDITIONS OUTPACE THE GROWTH IN GLOBAL

DEMAND. EXXONMOBIL’S INTEGRATION ACROSS THE VALUE CHAIN, FROM REFINING TO

MARKETING, ENHANCES OVERALL VALUE IN BOTH FUELS AND LUBRICANTS BUSINESSES.

AS

DESCRIBED IN MORE DETAIL IN ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS, PROPOSED CARBON POLICY AND

OTHER CLIMATE‐RELATED REGULATIONS IN MANY COUNTRIES, AS WELL AS THE

CONTINUED GROWTH IN BIOFUELS MANDATES, COULD HAVE NEGATIVE IMPACTS ON THE

DOWNSTREAM BUSINESS

IN

THE RETAIL FUELS MARKETING BUSINESS, COMPETITION HAS CAUSED INFLATION‐ADJUSTED

MARGINS TO DECLINE. IN 2015, EXXONMOBIL EXPANDED ITS BRANDED RETAIL SITE

NETWORK AND PROGRESSED THE MULTI‐YEAR TRANSITION OF THE DIRECT SERVED

(I.E., DEALER, COMPANY‐OPERATED) RETAIL NETWORK IN PORTIONS OF EUROPE TO

A MORE CAPITAL‐EFFICIENT BRANDED WHOLESALER MODEL. THE COMPANY’S

LUBRICANTS BUSINESS CONTINUES TO GROW, LEVERAGING WORLD‐CLASS BRANDS AND

INTEGRATION WITH INDUSTRY‐LEADING BASESTOCK REFINING CAPABILITY.

EXXONMOBIL REMAINS A MARKET LEADER IN THE HIGH‐VALUE SYNTHETIC LUBRICANTS

SECTOR, DESPITE INCREASING COMPETITION.

THE

DOWNSTREAM PORTFOLIO IS CONTINUALLY EVALUATED DURING ALL PARTS OF THE BUSINESS

CYCLE, AND NUMEROUS ASSET DIVESTMENTS HAVE BEEN MADE OVER THE PAST DECADE. IN

2015, THE COMPANY DIVESTED ITS 50 PERCENT SHARE OF CHALMETTE REFINING, LLC, AND

REACHED AN AGREEMENT FOR THE SALE OF THE REFINERY IN TORRANCE, CALIFORNIA, WITH

CHANGE-IN-CONTROL EXPECTED BY MID-2016. WHEN INVESTING IN THE DOWNSTREAM,

EXXONMOBIL REMAINS FOCUSED ON SELECTIVE AND RESILIENT PROJECTS. IN 2015,

CONSTRUCTION CONTINUED ON A NEW DELAYED COKER UNIT AT THE REFINERY IN ANTWERP,

BELGIUM, TO UPGRADE LOW‐VALUE BUNKER FUEL INTO HIGHER VALUE DIESEL

PRODUCTS. FUNDING WAS APPROVED FOR THE CONSTRUCTION OF A PROPRIETARY

HYDROCRACKER AT THE REFINERY IN ROTTERDAM, NETHERLANDS, TO PRODUCE HIGHER VALUE

ULTRA‐LOW SULFUR DIESEL AND GROUP II BASESTOCKS. THE COMPANY COMPLETED AN

EXPANSION OF LUBRICANT BASESTOCK CAPACITY AT THE REFINERY IN BAYTOWN, TEXAS.

FINISHED LUBRICANT PLANT EXPANSIONS IN CHINA AND FINLAND WERE COMPLETED, AND AN

EXPANSION IN SINGAPORE IS UNDERWAY TO SUPPORT DEMAND GROWTH FOR FINISHED

LUBRICANTS AND GREASES IN KEY MARKETS.

CHEMICAL

WORLDWIDE

PETROCHEMICAL DEMAND CONTINUED TO IMPROVE IN 2015, LED BY GROWING DEMAND FROM

ASIA PACIFIC MANUFACTURERS OF INDUSTRIAL AND CONSUMER PRODUCTS. NORTH AMERICA

CONTINUED TO BENEFIT FROM ABUNDANT SUPPLIES OF NATURAL GAS AND GAS LIQUIDS,

PROVIDING BOTH LOW‐COST FEEDSTOCK AND ENERGY. SPECIALTY PRODUCT MARGINS

IMPROVED IN 2015, BUT CONTINUED TO BE IMPACTED BY NEW INDUSTRY CAPACITY.

EXXONMOBIL

SUSTAINED ITS COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE THROUGH CONTINUED OPERATIONAL EXCELLENCE,

INVESTMENT AND COST DISCIPLINE, A BALANCED PORTFOLIO OF PRODUCTS, INTEGRATION

WITH REFINING AND UPSTREAM OPERATIONS, ALL UNDERPINNED BY PROPRIETARY

TECHNOLOGY.

IN

2015, WE NEARED COMPLETION OF THE SPECIALTY ELASTOMERS PROJECT AT OUR JOINT

VENTURE FACILITY IN AL-JUBAIL, SAUDI ARABIA. CONSTRUCTION CONTINUED ON A MAJOR

EXPANSION AT OUR TEXAS FACILITIES, INCLUDING A NEW WORLD-SCALE ETHANE CRACKER

AND POLYETHYLENE LINES, TO CAPITALIZE ON LOW-COST FEEDSTOCK AND ENERGY SUPPLIES

IN NORTH AMERICA AND TO MEET RAPIDLY GROWING DEMAND FOR PREMIUM POLYMERS.

CONSTRUCTION OF NEW HALOBUTYL RUBBER AND HYDROCARBON RESIN UNITS ALSO

PROGRESSED IN SINGAPORE TO FURTHER EXTEND OUR SPECIALTY PRODUCT CAPACITY IN

ASIA PACIFIC.

DESCRIPTIONS OF EXXONMOBIL’S VOLUMES RECONCILIATION FACTORS WHICH ARE PROVIDED

TO FACILITATE UNDERSTANDING OF THE TERMS.

ENTITLEMENTS - NET INTEREST

ARE CHANGES TO EXXONMOBIL’S SHARE OF

PRODUCTION VOLUMES CAUSED BY NON-OPERATIONAL CHANGES TO VOLUME-DETERMINING

FACTORS. THESE FACTORS CONSIST OF NET INTEREST CHANGES SPECIFIED IN PRODUCTION

SHARING CONTRACTS (PSCS) WHICH TYPICALLY OCCUR WHEN CUMULATIVE INVESTMENT

RETURNS OR PRODUCTION VOLUMES ACHIEVE DEFINED THRESHOLDS, CHANGES IN EQUITY

UPON ACHIEVING PAY-OUT IN PARTNER INVESTMENT CARRY SITUATIONS, EQUITY

REDETERMINATIONS AS SPECIFIED IN VENTURE AGREEMENTS, OR AS A RESULT OF THE

TERMINATION OR EXPIRY OF A CONCESSION. ONCE A NET INTEREST CHANGE HAS OCCURRED,

IT TYPICALLY WILL NOT BE REVERSED BY SUBSEQUENT EVENTS, SUCH AS LOWER CRUDE OIL

PRICES.

ENTITLEMENTS - PRICE, SPEND AND OTHER

ARE CHANGES TO EXXONMOBIL’S SHARE OF

PRODUCTION VOLUMES RESULTING FROM TEMPORARY CHANGES TO NON-OPERATIONAL

VOLUME-DETERMINING FACTORS. THESE FACTORS INCLUDE CHANGES IN OIL AND GAS PRICES

OR SPENDING LEVELS FROM ONE PERIOD TO ANOTHER. ACCORDING TO THE TERMS OF

CONTRACTUAL ARRANGEMENTS OR GOVERNMENT ROYALTY REGIMES, PRICE OR SPENDING

VARIABILITY CAN INCREASE OR DECREASE ROYALTY BURDENS AND/OR VOLUMES

ATTRIBUTABLE TO EXXONMOBIL. FOR EXAMPLE, AT HIGHER PRICES, FEWER BARRELS ARE

REQUIRED FOR EXXONMOBIL TO RECOVER ITS COSTS. THESE EFFECTS GENERALLY VARY FROM

PERIOD TO PERIOD WITH FIELD SPENDING PATTERNS OR MARKET PRICES FOR OIL AND

NATURAL GAS. SUCH FACTORS CAN ALSO INCLUDE OTHER TEMPORARY CHANGES IN NET

INTEREST AS DICTATED BY SPECIFIC PROVISIONS IN PRODUCTION AGREEMENTS.

QUOTAS

ARE CHANGES IN EXXONMOBIL’S ALLOWABLE PRODUCTION ARISING

DETAILS, SEE THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS.

THE

CORPORATION HAS ACCESS TO SIGNIFICANT CAPACITY OF LONG-TERM AND SHORT-TERM

LIQUIDITY. INTERNALLY GENERATED FUNDS ARE EXPECTED TO COVER THE MAJORITY OF

FINANCIAL REQUIREMENTS, SUPPLEMENTED BY LONG-TERM AND SHORT-TERM DEBT. ON

DECEMBER 31, 2015, THE CORPORATION HAD UNUSED COMMITTED SHORT-TERM LINES OF

CREDIT OF $6.0 BILLION AND UNUSED COMMITTED LONG-TERM LINES OF CREDIT OF $0.4

BILLION. CASH THAT MAY BE TEMPORARILY AVAILABLE AS SURPLUS TO THE CORPORATION’S

IMMEDIATE NEEDS IS CAREFULLY MANAGED THROUGH COUNTERPARTY QUALITY AND

INVESTMENT GUIDELINES TO ENSURE IT IS SECURE AND READILY AVAILABLE TO MEET THE

CORPORATION’S CASH REQUIREMENTS AND TO OPTIMIZE RETURNS.

TO

SUPPORT CASH FLOWS IN FUTURE PERIODS THE CORPORATION WILL NEED TO CONTINUALLY

FIND AND DEVELOP NEW FIELDS, AND CONTINUE TO DEVELOP AND APPLY NEW TECHNOLOGIES

AND RECOVERY PROCESSES TO EXISTING FIELDS, IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN OR INCREASE

PRODUCTION. AFTER A PERIOD OF PRODUCTION AT PLATEAU RATES, IT IS THE NATURE OF

OIL AND GAS FIELDS EVENTUALLY TO PRODUCE AT DECLINING RATES FOR THE REMAINDER

OF THEIR ECONOMIC LIFE. AVERAGED OVER ALL THE CORPORATION’S EXISTING OIL AND

GAS FIELDS AND WITHOUT NEW PROJECTS, EXXONMOBIL’S PRODUCTION IS EXPECTED TO

DECLINE AT AN AVERAGE OF APPROXIMATELY 3 PERCENT PER YEAR OVER THE NEXT FEW

YEARS. DECLINE RATES CAN VARY WIDELY BY INDIVIDUAL FIELD DUE TO A NUMBER OF

FACTORS, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE TYPE OF RESERVOIR, FLUID

PROPERTIES, RECOVERY MECHANISMS, WORK ACTIVITY, AND AGE OF THE FIELD.

FURTHERMORE, THE CORPORATION’S NET INTEREST IN PRODUCTION FOR INDIVIDUAL FIELDS

CAN VARY WITH PRICE AND THE IMPACT OF FISCAL AND COMMERCIAL TERMS.

THE

CORPORATION HAS LONG BEEN SUCCESSFUL AT OFFSETTING THE EFFECTS OF NATURAL FIELD

DECLINE THROUGH DISCIPLINED INVESTMENTS IN QUALITY OPPORTUNITIES AND PROJECT

EXECUTION. ON AVERAGE OVER THE LAST DECADE, THIS HAS RESULTED IN NET ANNUAL

ADDITIONS TO PROVED RESERVES THAT HAVE EXCEEDED THE AMOUNT PRODUCED. THE

CORPORATION ANTICIPATES SEVERAL PROJECTS WILL COME ONLINE OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS

PROVIDING ADDITIONAL PRODUCTION CAPACITY. HOWEVER, ACTUAL VOLUMES WILL VARY

FROM YEAR TO YEAR DUE TO THE TIMING OF INDIVIDUAL PROJECT START-UPS;

OPERATIONAL OUTAGES; RESERVOIR PERFORMANCE; PERFORMANCE OF ENHANCED OIL

RECOVERY PROJECTS; REGULATORY CHANGES; THE IMPACT OF FISCAL AND COMMERCIAL

TERMS; ASSET SALES; WEATHER EVENTS; PRICE EFFECTS ON PRODUCTION SHARING

CONTRACTS; AND CHANGES IN THE AMOUNT AND TIMING OF INVESTMENTS THAT MAY VARY

DEPENDING ON THE OIL AND GAS PRICE ENVIRONMENT. THE CORPORATION’S CASH FLOWS

ARE ALSO HIGHLY DEPENDENT ON CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS PRICES. PLEASE REFER TO

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS FOR A MORE COMPLETE DISCUSSION OF RISKS.

48

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

THE CORPORATION’S FINANCIAL STRENGTH

ENABLES IT TO MAKE LARGE, LONG-TERM CAPITAL EXPENDITURES. CAPITAL AND

EXPLORATION EXPENDITURES IN 2015 WERE $31.1 BILLION, REFLECTING THE

CORPORATION’S CONTINUED ACTIVE INVESTMENT PROGRAM. THE CORPORATION ANTICIPATES

AN INVESTMENT LEVEL OF $23.2 BILLION IN 2016. THE CORPORATION IS EMERGING FROM

SEVERAL YEARS OF HIGH CAPITAL EXPENDITURE LEVELS THAT SUPPORTED MAJOR

LONG-PLATEAU PRODUCTION PROJECTS COMING ON LINE. LOWER LEVELS OF CAPITAL

SPENDING OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS, PARTLY DUE TO COST SAVINGS AND CAPITAL

EFFICIENCIES, ARE NOT EXPECTED TO DELAY MAJOR PROJECT SCHEDULES NOR HAVE A

MATERIAL EFFECT ON OUR VOLUME CAPACITY OUTLOOK.

ACTUAL

SPENDING COULD VARY DEPENDING ON THE PROGRESS OF INDIVIDUAL PROJECTS AND

PROPERTY ACQUISITIONS. THE CORPORATION HAS A LARGE AND DIVERSE PORTFOLIO OF

DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS AND EXPLORATION OPPORTUNITIES, WHICH HELPS MITIGATE THE

OVERALL POLITICAL AND TECHNICAL RISKS OF THE CORPORATION’S UPSTREAM SEGMENT AND

ASSOCIATED CASH FLOW. FURTHER, DUE TO ITS FINANCIAL STRENGTH, DEBT CAPACITY AND

DIVERSE PORTFOLIO OF OPPORTUNITIES, THE RISK ASSOCIATED WITH FAILURE OR DELAY

OF ANY SINGLE PROJECT WOULD NOT HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE CORPORATION’S

LIQUIDITY OR ABILITY TO GENERATE SUFFICIENT CASH FLOWS FOR OPERATIONS AND ITS

FIXED COMMITMENTS.

CASH FLOW FROM

OPERATING ACTIVITIES

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

CASH FLOW FROM FINANCING ACTIVITIES

2015

CASH

USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES WAS $7.0 BILLION IN 2015, $10.9 BILLION LOWER THAN

2014. DIVIDEND PAYMENTS ON COMMON SHARES INCREASED TO $2.88 PER SHARE FROM

$2.70 PER SHARE AND TOTALED $12.1 BILLION, A PAY-OUT OF 75 PERCENT OF NET

INCOME. DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2015, THE CORPORATION ISSUED $8.0 BILLION

OF LONG-TERM DEBT. TOTAL DEBT INCREASED $9.6 BILLION TO $38.7 BILLION AT YEAR‐END.

EXXONMOBIL

SHARE OF EQUITY DECREASED $3.6 BILLION TO $170.8 BILLION. THE ADDITION TO

EQUITY FOR EARNINGS WAS $16.2 BILLION. THIS WAS OFFSET BY REDUCTIONS FOR

DISTRIBUTIONS TO EXXONMOBIL SHAREHOLDERS OF $15.1 BILLION, COMPOSED OF $12.1

BILLION IN DIVIDENDS AND $3.0 BILLION OF SHARE PURCHASES OF EXXONMOBIL STOCK TO

REDUCE SHARES OUTSTANDING. FOREIGN EXCHANGE TRANSLATION EFFECTS OF $8.2 BILLION

FOR THE STRONGER U.S. CURRENCY REDUCED EQUITY, WHILE A $3.6 BILLION CHANGE IN

THE FUNDED STATUS OF THE POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS RESERVES INCREASED EQUITY.

DURING 2015, EXXON MOBIL CORPORATION

PURCHASED 48 MILLION SHARES OF ITS COMMON STOCK FOR THE TREASURY AT A GROSS

COST OF $4.0 BILLION. THESE PURCHASES WERE TO REDUCE THE NUMBER OF SHARES

OUTSTANDING AND TO OFFSET SHARES ISSUED IN CONJUNCTION WITH COMPANY BENEFIT

PLANS AND PROGRAMS. SHARES OUTSTANDING WERE REDUCED BY 1.1 PERCENT FROM 4,201

MILLION TO 4,156 MILLION AT THE END OF 2015. PURCHASES WERE MADE IN BOTH THE

OPEN MARKET AND THROUGH NEGOTIATED TRANSACTIONS. PURCHASES MAY BE INCREASED,

DECREASED OR DISCONTINUED AT ANY TIME WITHOUT PRIOR NOTICE.

2014

CASH

USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES WAS $17.9 BILLION IN 2014, $2.4 BILLION HIGHER

THAN 2013. DIVIDEND PAYMENTS ON COMMON SHARES INCREASED TO $2.70 PER SHARE FROM

$2.46 PER SHARE AND TOTALED $11.6 BILLION, A PAY-OUT OF 36 PERCENT OF NET INCOME.

DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2014, THE CORPORATION ISSUED $5.5 BILLION OF

LONG-TERM DEBT. TOTAL DEBT INCREASED $6.4 BILLION TO $29.1 BILLION AT YEAR‐END.

EXXONMOBIL

SHARE OF EQUITY INCREASED $0.4 BILLION TO $174.4 BILLION. THE ADDITION TO

EQUITY FOR EARNINGS WAS $32.5 BILLION. THIS WAS OFFSET BY REDUCTIONS FOR

DISTRIBUTIONS TO EXXONMOBIL SHAREHOLDERS OF $23.6 BILLION, COMPOSED OF $11.6

BILLION IN DIVIDENDS AND $12.0 BILLION OF SHARE PURCHASES OF EXXONMOBIL STOCK

TO REDUCE SHARES OUTSTANDING. FOREIGN EXCHANGE TRANSLATION EFFECTS OF $5.1

BILLION FOR THE STRONGER U.S. CURRENCY AND A $3.1 BILLION CHANGE IN THE FUNDED

STATUS OF THE POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS RESERVES ALSO REDUCED EQUITY.

DURING 2014, EXXON MOBIL CORPORATION

PURCHASED 136 MILLION SHARES OF ITS COMMON STOCK FOR THE TREASURY AT A GROSS

COST OF $13.2 BILLION. THESE PURCHASES WERE TO REDUCE THE NUMBER OF SHARES

OUTSTANDING AND TO OFFSET SHARES ISSUED IN CONJUNCTION WITH COMPANY BENEFIT

PLANS AND PROGRAMS. SHARES OUTSTANDING WERE REDUCED BY 3.1 PERCENT FROM 4,335

MILLION TO 4,201 MILLION AT THE END OF 2014. PURCHASES WERE MADE IN BOTH THE

OPEN MARKET AND THROUGH NEGOTIATED TRANSACTIONS.

ACTIVE, HIGHLY LIQUID MARKET OR UNDER LONG-TERM, UNCONDITIONAL SALES CONTRACTS

WITH SIMILAR PRICING TERMS. EXAMPLES INCLUDE LONG-TERM, NONCANCELABLE LNG AND

NATURAL GAS PURCHASE COMMITMENTS AND COMMITMENTS TO PURCHASE REFINERY PRODUCTS

AT MARKET PRICES. INCLUSION OF SUCH COMMITMENTS WOULD NOT BE MEANINGFUL IN

ASSESSING LIQUIDITY AND CASH FLOW, BECAUSE THESE PURCHASES WILL BE OFFSET IN

THE SAME PERIODS BY CASH RECEIVED FROM THE RELATED SALES TRANSACTIONS. THE

TABLE ALSO EXCLUDES UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS TOTALING $9.4 BILLION AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2015, BECAUSE THE CORPORATION IS UNABLE TO MAKE REASONABLY

RELIABLE ESTIMATES OF THE TIMING OF CASH SETTLEMENTS WITH THE RESPECTIVE TAXING

AUTHORITIES. FURTHER DETAILS ON THE UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS CAN BE FOUND IN “NOTE

19: INCOME, SALES-BASED AND OTHER TAXES.”

NOTES.

(1)   INCLUDES CAPITALIZED LEASE

OBLIGATIONS OF $1,238 MILLION.

(2)   THE AMOUNT DUE IN ONE YEAR IS

INCLUDED IN NOTES AND LOANS PAYABLE OF $18,762 MILLION.

(3)   THE FAIR VALUE OF ASSET RETIREMENT

OBLIGATIONS, PRIMARILY UPSTREAM ASSET REMOVAL COSTS AT THE COMPLETION OF FIELD

LIFE.

(4)   THE AMOUNT BY WHICH THE BENEFIT

OBLIGATIONS EXCEEDED THE FAIR VALUE OF FUND ASSETS FOR CERTAIN U.S. AND

NON-U.S. PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT PLANS AT YEAR END. THE PAYMENTS BY

PERIOD INCLUDE EXPECTED CONTRIBUTIONS TO FUNDED PENSION PLANS IN 2016 AND

ESTIMATED BENEFIT PAYMENTS FOR UNFUNDED PLANS IN ALL YEARS.

(5)   MINIMUM COMMITMENTS FOR OPERATING

LEASES, SHOWN ON AN UNDISCOUNTED BASIS, COVER DRILLING EQUIPMENT, TANKERS,

SERVICE STATIONS AND OTHER PROPERTIES. TOTAL INCLUDES $1,621 MILLION RELATED TO

DRILLING RIGS AND RELATED EQUIPMENT.

(6)   UNCONDITIONAL PURCHASE OBLIGATIONS

(UPOS) ARE THOSE LONG-TERM COMMITMENTS THAT ARE NONCANCELABLE OR CANCELABLE

ONLY UNDER CERTAIN CONDITIONS, AND THAT THIRD PARTIES HAVE USED TO SECURE

FINANCING FOR THE FACILITIES THAT WILL PROVIDE THE CONTRACTED GOODS OR

SERVICES. THE UNDISCOUNTED OBLIGATIONS OF $936 MILLION MAINLY PERTAIN TO

PIPELINE THROUGHPUT AGREEMENTS AND INCLUDE $411 MILLION OF OBLIGATIONS TO

EQUITY COMPANIES.

(7)   TAKE-OR-PAY OBLIGATIONS ARE

NONCANCELABLE, LONG-TERM COMMITMENTS FOR GOODS AND SERVICES OTHER THAN UPOS.

THE UNDISCOUNTED OBLIGATIONS OF $24,870 MILLION MAINLY PERTAIN TO PIPELINE,

MANUFACTURING SUPPLY AND TERMINAL AGREEMENTS.

(8)   FIRM COMMITMENTS RELATED TO CAPITAL

PROJECTS, SHOWN ON AN UNDISCOUNTED BASIS, TOTALED APPROXIMATELY $15.2 BILLION.

THESE COMMITMENTS WERE PRIMARILY ASSOCIATED WITH UPSTREAM PROJECTS OUTSIDE THE

U.S., OF WHICH $8.0 BILLION WAS ASSOCIATED WITH PROJECTS IN AFRICA, UNITED ARAB

EMIRATES, CANADA, MALAYSIA, KAZAKHSTAN AND AUSTRALIA. THE CORPORATION EXPECTS

TO FUND THE MAJORITY OF THESE PROJECTS WITH I

NTERNALLY GENERATED FUNDS, SUPPLEMENTED BY

LONG-TERM AND SHORT-TERM DEBT.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

GUARANTEES

THE

CORPORATION AND CERTAIN OF ITS CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES WERE CONTINGENTLY

LIABLE AT DECEMBER 31, 2015, FOR GUARANTEES RELATING TO NOTES, LOANS AND

PERFORMANCE UNDER CONTRACTS (NOTE 16). WHERE GUARANTEES FOR ENVIRONMENTAL

REMEDIATION AND OTHER SIMILAR MATTERS DO NOT INCLUDE A STATED CAP, THE AMOUNTS

REFLECT MANAGEMENT’S ESTIMATE OF THE MAXIMUM POTENTIAL EXPOSURE. THESE GUARANTEES

ARE NOT REASONABLY LIKELY TO HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE CORPORATION’S

FINANCIAL CONDITION, CHANGES IN FINANCIAL CONDITION, REVENUES OR EXPENSES,

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, LIQUIDITY, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES OR CAPITAL RESOURCES.

FINANCIAL STRENGTH

ON

DECEMBER 31, 2015, THE CORPORATION’S UNUSED SHORT-TERM COMMITTED LINES OF CREDIT

TOTALED APPROXIMATELY $6.0 BILLION (NOTE 6) AND UNUSED LONG-TERM COMMITTED

LINES OF CREDIT TOTALED APPROXIMATELY $0.4 BILLION (NOTE 14). THE TABLE BELOW

SHOWS THE CORPORATION’S FIXED-CHARGE COVERAGE AND CONSOLIDATED DEBT-TO-CAPITAL

MANAGEMENT

VIEWS THE CORPORATION’S FINANCIAL STRENGTH, AS EVIDENCED BY THE ABOVE FINANCIAL

RATIOS AND OTHER SIMILAR MEASURES, TO BE A COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE OF STRATEGIC

IMPORTANCE. THE CORPORATION’S SOUND FINANCIAL POSITION GIVES IT THE OPPORTUNITY

TO ACCESS THE WORLD’S CAPITAL MARKETS IN THE FULL RANGE OF MARKET CONDITIONS,

AND ENABLES THE CORPORATION TO TAKE ON LARGE, LONG-TERM CAPITAL COMMITMENTS IN

THE PURSUIT OF MAXIMIZING SHAREHOLDER VALUE.

LITIGATION AND OTHER CONTINGENCIES

AS

DISCUSSED IN NOTE 16, A VARIETY OF CLAIMS HAVE BEEN MADE AGAINST EXXONMOBIL AND

CERTAIN OF ITS CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES IN A NUMBER OF PENDING LAWSUITS. BASED

ON A CONSIDERATION OF ALL RELEVANT FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES, THE CORPORATION

DOES NOT BELIEVE THE ULTIMATE OUTCOME OF ANY CURRENTLY PENDING LAWSUIT AGAINST

EXXONMOBIL WILL HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT UPON THE CORPORATION’S

OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, OR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS TAKEN AS A WHOLE.

THERE ARE NO EVENTS OR UNCERTAINTIES BEYOND THOSE ALREADY INCLUDED IN REPORTED

FINANCIAL INFORMATION THAT WOULD INDICATE A MATERIAL CHANGE IN FUTURE OPERATING

RESULTS OR FINANCIAL CONDITION. REFER TO NOTE 16 FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND OTHER CONTINGENCIES.

EXPLORATION EXPENSES INCLUDED.

CAPITAL

AND EXPLORATION EXPENDITURES IN 2015 WERE $31.1 BILLION, AS THE CORPORATION

CONTINUED TO PURSUE OPPORTUNITIES TO FIND AND PRODUCE NEW SUPPLIES OF OIL AND

NATURAL GAS TO MEET GLOBAL DEMAND FOR ENERGY. THE CORPORATION ANTICIPATES AN INVESTMENT

LEVEL OF $23.2 BILLION IN 2016. ACTUAL SPENDING COULD VARY DEPENDING ON THE

PROGRESS OF INDIVIDUAL PROJECTS AND PROPERTY ACQUISITIONS.

UPSTREAM

SPENDING OF $25.4 BILLION IN 2015 WAS DOWN 22 PERCENT FROM 2014, REFLECTING KEY

PROJECT START-UPS AND CAPITAL EFFICIENCIES. INVESTMENTS IN 2015 INCLUDED

PROJECTS IN THE U.S. GULF OF MEXICO AND ALASKA, U.S. ONSHORE DRILLING AND

CONTINUED PROGRESS ON WORLD-CLASS PROJECTS IN CANADA AND AUSTRALIA. THE

MAJORITY OF EXPENDITURES ARE ON DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS, WHICH TYPICALLY TAKE TWO

TO FOUR YEARS FROM THE TIME OF RECORDING PROVED UNDEVELOPED RESERVES TO THE

START OF PRODUCTION. THE PERCENTAGE OF PROVED DEVELOPED RESERVES WAS 73 PERCENT

OF TOTAL PROVED RESERVES AT YEAR-END 2015, AND HAS BEEN OVER 60 PERCENT FOR THE

LAST TEN YEARS.

CAPITAL

INVESTMENTS IN THE DOWNSTREAM TOTALED $2.6 BILLION IN 2015, A DECREASE OF $0.4

BILLION FROM 2014, MAINLY REFLECTING LOWER REFINING PROJECT SPENDING. THE

CHEMICAL CAPITAL EXPENDITURES OF $2.8 BILLION INCREASED $0.1 BILLION FROM 2014

WITH HIGHER INVESTMENTS IN THE U.S.

CURRENT AND DEFERRED, WAS $5.4 BILLION, $12.6 BILLION LOWER THAN 2014, AS A

RESULT OF LOWER EARNINGS AND A LOWER EFFECTIVE TAX RATE. THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE

WAS 34 PERCENT COMPARED TO 41 PERCENT IN THE PRIOR YEAR DUE PRIMARILY TO A

LOWER SHARE OF EARNINGS IN HIGHER TAX JURISDICTIONS. SALES-BASED AND ALL OTHER

TAXES AND DUTIES OF $52.5 BILLION IN 2015 DECREASED $12.4 BILLION AS A RESULT

OF LOWER SALES REALIZATIONS.

2014

INCOME,

SALES-BASED AND ALL OTHER TAXES AND DUTIES TOTALED $82.9 BILLION IN 2014, A

DECREASE OF $8.4 BILLION OR 9 PERCENT FROM 2013. INCOME TAX EXPENSE, BOTH

CURRENT AND DEFERRED, WAS $18.0 BILLION, $6.2 BILLION LOWER THAN 2013, AS A

RESULT OF A LOWER EFFECTIVE TAX RATE. THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE WAS 41 PERCENT

COMPARED TO 48 PERCENT IN THE PRIOR YEAR DUE PRIMARILY TO IMPACTS RELATED TO

THE CORPORATION’S ASSET MANAGEMENT PROGRAM AND FAVORABLE U.S. DEFERRED TAX

ITEMS. SALES-BASED AND ALL OTHER TAXES AND DUTIES OF $64.9 BILLION IN 2014

DECREASED $2.1 BILLION.

THROUGHOUT

EXXONMOBIL’S BUSINESSES, NEW AND ONGOING MEASURES ARE TAKEN TO PREVENT AND

MINIMIZE THE IMPACT OF OUR OPERATIONS ON AIR, WATER AND GROUND. THESE

INCLUDE A SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT IN REFINING INFRASTRUCTURE AND TECHNOLOGY TO

MANUFACTURE CLEAN FUELS, AS WELL AS PROJECTS TO MONITOR AND REDUCE

NITROGEN OXIDE, SULFUR OXIDE AND GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS, AND EXPENDITURES FOR

ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS. USING DEFINITIONS AND GUIDELINES ESTABLISHED BY

THE AMERICAN PETROLEUM INSTITUTE, EXXONMOBIL’S 2015 WORLDWIDE ENVIRONMENTAL

EXPENDITURES FOR ALL SUCH PREVENTATIVE AND REMEDIATION STEPS, INCLUDING

EXXONMOBIL’S SHARE OF EQUITY COMPANY EXPENDITURES, WERE $5.6 BILLION, OF

WHICH $3.8 BILLION WERE INCLUDED IN EXPENSES WITH THE REMAINDER IN CAPITAL

EXPENDITURES. THE TOTAL COST FOR SUCH ACTIVITIES IS EXPECTED TO DECREASE TO

APPROXIMATELY $5 BILLION IN 2016 AND 2017, MAINLY REFLECTING LOWER PROJECT

ACTIVITY IN CANADA. CAPITAL EXPENDITURES ARE EXPECTED TO ACCOUNT FOR APPROXIMATELY

30 PERCENT OF THE TOTAL.

ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES

THE

CORPORATION ACCRUES ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES WHEN IT IS PROBABLE THAT

OBLIGATIONS HAVE BEEN INCURRED AND THE AMOUNTS CAN BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED.

THIS POLICY APPLIES TO ASSETS OR BUSINESSES CURRENTLY OWNED OR PREVIOUSLY

DISPOSED. EXXONMOBIL HAS ACCRUED LIABILITIES FOR PROBABLE ENVIRONMENTAL

REMEDIATION OBLIGATIONS AT VARIOUS SITES, INCLUDING MULTIPARTY SITES WHERE THE

U.S. ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY HAS IDENTIFIED EXXONMOBIL AS ONE OF THE

POTENTIALLY RESPONSIBLE PARTIES. THE INVOLVEMENT OF OTHER FINANCIALLY

RESPONSIBLE COMPANIES AT THESE MULTIPARTY SITES COULD MITIGATE EXXONMOBIL’S

ACTUAL JOINT AND SEVERAL LIABILITY EXPOSURE. AT PRESENT, NO INDIVIDUAL SITE IS

EXPECTED TO HAVE LOSSES MATERIAL TO EXXONMOBIL’S OPERATIONS OR FINANCIAL

CONDITION. CONSOLIDATED COMPANY PROVISIONS MADE IN 2015 FOR ENVIRONMENTAL

LIABILITIES WERE $371 MILLION ($780 MILLION IN 2014) AND THE BALANCE

SHEET REFLECTS ACCUMULATED LIABILITIES OF $837 MILLION AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2015, AND $1,066 MILLION AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2014.

CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES.

CRUDE

OIL, NATURAL GAS, PETROLEUM PRODUCT AND CHEMICAL PRICES HAVE FLUCTUATED IN

RESPONSE TO CHANGING MARKET FORCES. THE IMPACTS OF THESE PRICE FLUCTUATIONS ON

EARNINGS FROM UPSTREAM, DOWNSTREAM AND CHEMICAL OPERATIONS HAVE VARIED. IN THE

UPSTREAM, A $1 PER BARREL CHANGE IN THE WEIGHTED-AVERAGE REALIZED

PRICE OF OIL WOULD HAVE APPROXIMATELY A $375 MILLION ANNUAL AFTER-TAX EFFECT ON

UPSTREAM CONSOLIDATED PLUS EQUITY COMPANY EARNINGS. SIMILARLY, A $0.10 PER KCF

CHANGE IN THE WORLDWIDE AVERAGE GAS REALIZATION WOULD HAVE APPROXIMATELY A $150

MILLION ANNUAL AFTER-TAX EFFECT ON UPSTREAM CONSOLIDATED PLUS EQUITY COMPANY

EARNINGS. FOR ANY GIVEN PERIOD, THE EXTENT OF ACTUAL BENEFIT OR DETRIMENT WILL

BE DEPENDENT ON THE PRICE MOVEMENTS OF INDIVIDUAL TYPES OF CRUDE OIL, TAXES AND

OTHER GOVERNMENT TAKE IMPACTS, PRICE ADJUSTMENT LAGS IN LONG-TERM GAS

CONTRACTS, AND CRUDE AND GAS PRODUCTION VOLUMES. ACCORDINGLY, CHANGES IN

BENCHMARK PRICES FOR CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS ONLY PROVIDE BROAD INDICATORS OF

CHANGES IN THE EARNINGS EXPERIENCED IN ANY PARTICULAR PERIOD.

IN

THE VERY COMPETITIVE DOWNSTREAM AND CHEMICAL ENVIRONMENTS, EARNINGS ARE

PRIMARILY DETERMINED BY MARGIN CAPTURE RATHER THAN ABSOLUTE PRICE LEVELS OF

PRODUCTS SOLD. REFINING MARGINS ARE A FUNCTION OF THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WHAT A

REFINER PAYS FOR ITS RAW MATERIALS (PRIMARILY CRUDE OIL) AND THE MARKET PRICES

FOR THE RANGE OF PRODUCTS PRODUCED. THESE PRICES IN TURN DEPEND ON GLOBAL AND

REGIONAL SUPPLY/DEMAND BALANCES, INVENTORY LEVELS, REFINERY OPERATIONS,

IMPORT/EXPORT BALANCES AND WEATHER.

54

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

THE GLOBAL

ENERGY MARKETS CAN GIVE RISE TO EXTENDED PERIODS IN WHICH MARKET CONDITIONS ARE

ADVERSE TO ONE OR MORE OF THE CORPORATION’S BUSINESSES. SUCH CONDITIONS, ALONG

WITH THE CAPITAL-INTENSIVE NATURE OF THE INDUSTRY AND VERY LONG LEAD TIMES

ASSOCIATED WITH MANY OF OUR PROJECTS, UNDERSCORE THE IMPORTANCE OF MAINTAINING

A STRONG FINANCIAL POSITION. MANAGEMENT VIEWS THE CORPORATION’S FINANCIAL

STRENGTH AS A COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE.

IN

GENERAL, SEGMENT RESULTS ARE NOT DEPENDENT ON THE ABILITY TO SELL AND/OR

PURCHASE PRODUCTS TO/FROM OTHER SEGMENTS. INSTEAD, WHERE SUCH SALES TAKE PLACE,

THEY ARE THE RESULT OF EFFICIENCIES AND COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGES OF INTEGRATED

REFINERY/CHEMICAL COMPLEXES. ADDITIONALLY, INTERSEGMENT SALES ARE AT

MARKET-BASED PRICES. THE PRODUCTS BOUGHT AND SOLD BETWEEN SEGMENTS CAN ALSO BE

ACQUIRED IN WORLDWIDE MARKETS THAT HAVE SUBSTANTIAL LIQUIDITY, CAPACITY AND

TRANSPORTATION CAPABILITIES. ABOUT 35 PERCENT OF THE CORPORATION’S INTERSEGMENT

SALES REPRESENT UPSTREAM PRODUCTION SOLD TO THE DOWNSTREAM. OTHER INTERSEGMENT

SALES INCLUDE THOSE BETWEEN REFINERIES AND CHEMICAL PLANTS RELATED TO RAW

MATERIALS, FEEDSTOCKS AND FINISHED PRODUCTS.

ALTHOUGH

PRICE LEVELS OF CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS MAY RISE OR FALL SIGNIFICANTLY OVER

THE SHORT TO MEDIUM TERM DUE TO GLOBAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, POLITICAL EVENTS, DECISIONS

BY OPEC AND OTHER MAJOR GOVERNMENT RESOURCE OWNERS AND OTHER FACTORS, INDUSTRY

ECONOMICS OVER THE LONG TERM WILL CONTINUE TO BE DRIVEN BY MARKET SUPPLY AND

DEMAND. ACCORDINGLY, THE CORPORATION EVALUATES THE VIABILITY OF ALL OF ITS

INVESTMENTS OVER A BROAD RANGE OF PRICES. THE CORPORATION’S ASSESSMENT IS THAT

ITS OPERATIONS WILL CONTINUE TO BE SUCCESSFUL OVER THE LONG TERM IN A VARIETY

OF MARKET CONDITIONS. THIS IS THE OUTCOME OF DISCIPLINED INVESTMENT AND ASSET

MANAGEMENT PROGRAMS.

THE

CORPORATION HAS AN ACTIVE ASSET MANAGEMENT PROGRAM IN WHICH UNDERPERFORMING

ASSETS ARE EITHER IMPROVED TO ACCEPTABLE LEVELS OR CONSIDERED FOR DIVESTMENT.

THE ASSET MANAGEMENT PROGRAM INCLUDES A DISCIPLINED, REGULAR REVIEW TO ENSURE

THAT ALL ASSETS ARE CONTRIBUTING TO THE CORPORATION’S STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES. THE

RESULT IS AN EFFICIENT CAPITAL BASE, AND THE CORPORATION HAS SELDOM HAD TO

WRITE DOWN THE CARRYING VALUE OF ASSETS, EVEN DURING PERIODS OF LOW COMMODITY

PRICES.

RISK MANAGEMENT

THE

CORPORATION’S SIZE, STRONG CAPITAL STRUCTURE, GEOGRAPHIC DIVERSITY AND THE

COMPLEMENTARY NATURE OF THE UPSTREAM, DOWNSTREAM AND CHEMICAL BUSINESSES REDUCE

THE CORPORATION’S ENTERPRISE-WIDE RISK FROM CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES, CURRENCY

RATES AND COMMODITY PRICES. AS A RESULT, THE CORPORATION MAKES LIMITED USE OF

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS TO MITIGATE THE IMPACT OF SUCH CHANGES. WITH RESPECT TO

DERIVATIVES ACTIVITIES, THE CORPORATION BELIEVES THAT THERE ARE NO MATERIAL

MARKET OR CREDIT RISKS TO THE CORPORATION’S FINANCIAL POSITION, RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS OR LIQUIDITY AS A RESULT OF THE DERIVATIVES DESCRIBED IN NOTE 13.

THE CORPORATION DOES NOT ENGAGE IN SPECULATIVE DERIVATIVE ACTIVITIES OR

DERIVATIVE TRADING ACTIVITIES NOR DOES IT USE DERIVATIVES WITH LEVERAGED FEATURES.

CREDIT RISK ASSOCIATED WITH THE CORPORATION’S DERIVATIVE POSITION IS MITIGATED

BY SEVERAL FACTORS, INCLUDING THE USE OF DERIVATIVE CLEARING EXCHANGES AND THE

QUALITY OF AND FINANCIAL LIMITS PLACED ON DERIVATIVE COUNTERPARTIES. THE

CORPORATION MAINTAINS A SYSTEM OF CONTROLS THAT INCLUDES THE AUTHORIZATION,

REPORTING AND MONITORING OF DERIVATIVE ACTIVITY.

THE

CORPORATION IS EXPOSED TO CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES, PRIMARILY ON ITS

SHORT-TERM DEBT AND THE PORTION OF LONG-TERM DEBT THAT CARRIES FLOATING

INTEREST RATES. THE IMPACT OF A 100-BASIS-POINT CHANGE IN INTEREST RATES

AFFECTING THE CORPORATION’S DEBT WOULD NOT BE MATERIAL TO EARNINGS, CASH FLOW

OR FAIR VALUE. THE CORPORATION HAS ACCESS TO SIGNIFICANT CAPACITY OF LONG-TERM

AND SHORT-TERM LIQUIDITY. INTERNALLY GENERATED FUNDS ARE EXPECTED TO COVER THE

MAJORITY OF FINANCIAL REQUIREMENTS, SUPPLEMENTED BY LONG-TERM AND SHORT-TERM

DEBT. SOME JOINT-VENTURE PARTNERS ARE DEPENDENT ON THE CREDIT MARKETS, AND

THEIR FUNDING ABILITY MAY IMPACT THE DEVELOPMENT PACE OF JOINT-VENTURE

PROJECTS.

THE

CORPORATION CONDUCTS BUSINESS IN MANY FOREIGN CURRENCIES AND IS SUBJECT TO

EXCHANGE RATE RISK ON CASH FLOWS RELATED TO SALES, EXPENSES, FINANCING AND

INVESTMENT TRANSACTIONS. THE IMPACTS OF FLUCTUATIONS IN EXCHANGE RATES ON EXXONMOBIL’S

GEOGRAPHICALLY AND FUNCTIONALLY DIVERSE OPERATIONS ARE VARIED AND OFTEN

OFFSETTING IN AMOUNT. THE CORPORATION MAKES LIMITED USE OF CURRENCY EXCHANGE

CONTRACTS TO MITIGATE THE IMPACT OF CHANGES IN CURRENCY VALUES, AND EXPOSURES

RELATED TO THE CORPORATION’S LIMITED USE OF THE CURRENCY EXCHANGE CONTRACTS ARE

NOT MATERIAL.

INFLATION AND OTHER UNCERTAINTIES

THE

GENERAL RATE OF INFLATION IN MANY MAJOR COUNTRIES OF OPERATION HAS REMAINED

MODERATE OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS, AND THE ASSOCIATED IMPACT ON NON-ENERGY COSTS

HAS GENERALLY BEEN MITIGATED BY COST REDUCTIONS FROM EFFICIENCY AND

PRODUCTIVITY IMPROVEMENTS. BEGINNING SEVERAL YEARS AGO, AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF

INCREASED DEMAND FOR CERTAIN SERVICES AND MATERIALS RESULTED IN HIGHER

OPERATING AND CAPITAL COSTS. MORE RECENTLY, MULTIPLE MARKET CHANGES, INCLUDING

GENERAL COMMODITY PRICE DECREASES, LOWER OIL PRICES AND REDUCED UPSTREAM INDUSTRY

ACTIVITY, HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO LOWER PRICES FOR OILFIELD SERVICES AND MATERIALS.

THE CORPORATION WORKS TO MINIMIZE COSTS IN ALL COMMODITY PRICE ENVIRONMENTS THROUGH

ITS ECONOMIES OF SCALE IN GLOBAL PROCUREMENT AND ITS EFFICIENT PROJECT

MANAGEMENT PRACTICES.

AND OTHER OPERATING REVENUE” ON THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF INCOME INCLUDES

SALES, EXCISE AND VALUE-ADDED TAXES ON SALES TRANSACTIONS. WHEN THE CORPORATION

ADOPTS THE STANDARD, REVENUE WILL EXCLUDE SALES-BASED TAXES COLLECTED ON BEHALF

OF THIRD PARTIES. THIS CHANGE IN REPORTING WILL NOT IMPACT EARNINGS.

THE

CORPORATION CONTINUES TO EVALUATE OTHER AREAS OF THE STANDARD AND ITS EFFECT ON

THE CORPORATION’S FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

THE

CORPORATION’S ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL REPORTING FAIRLY REFLECT ITS

STRAIGHTFORWARD BUSINESS MODEL INVOLVING THE EXTRACTING, REFINING AND MARKETING

OF HYDROCARBONS AND HYDROCARBON-BASED PRODUCTS. THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS IN CONFORMITY WITH U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES

(GAAP) REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS THAT AFFECT THE

REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS, LIABILITIES, REVENUES AND EXPENSES AND THE

DISCLOSURE OF CONTINGENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. THE CORPORATION’S ACCOUNTING

POLICIES ARE SUMMARIZED IN NOTE 1.

OIL AND GAS RESERVES

EVALUATIONS

OF OIL AND GAS RESERVES ARE IMPORTANT TO THE EFFECTIVE MANAGEMENT OF UPSTREAM

ASSETS. THEY ARE AN INTEGRAL PART OF INVESTMENT DECISIONS ABOUT OIL AND GAS

PROPERTIES SUCH AS WHETHER DEVELOPMENT SHOULD PROCEED. OIL AND GAS RESERVE

QUANTITIES ARE ALSO USED AS THE BASIS TO CALCULATE UNIT-OF-PRODUCTION

DEPRECIATION RATES AND TO EVALUATE IMPAIRMENT.

OIL

AND GAS RESERVES INCLUDE BOTH PROVED AND UNPROVED RESERVES. PROVED OIL AND GAS

RESERVES ARE THOSE QUANTITIES OF OIL AND GAS WHICH, BY ANALYSIS OF GEOSCIENCE

AND ENGINEERING DATA, CAN BE ESTIMATED WITH REASONABLE CERTAINTY TO BE

ECONOMICALLY PRODUCIBLE. UNPROVED RESERVES ARE THOSE WITH LESS THAN REASONABLE

CERTAINTY OF RECOVERABILITY AND INCLUDE PROBABLE RESERVES. PROBABLE RESERVES

ARE RESERVES THAT, TOGETHER WITH PROVED RESERVES, ARE AS LIKELY AS NOT TO BE

RECOVERED.

THE

ESTIMATION OF PROVED RESERVES IS AN ONGOING PROCESS BASED ON RIGOROUS TECHNICAL

EVALUATIONS, COMMERCIAL AND MARKET ASSESSMENT, AND DETAILED ANALYSIS OF WELL

INFORMATION SUCH AS FLOW RATES AND RESERVOIR PRESSURE DECLINES. THE ESTIMATION

OF PROVED RESERVES IS CONTROLLED BY THE CORPORATION THROUGH LONG-STANDING

APPROVAL GUIDELINES. RESERVE CHANGES ARE MADE WITHIN A WELL-ESTABLISHED,

DISCIPLINED PROCESS DRIVEN BY SENIOR LEVEL GEOSCIENCE AND ENGINEERING

PROFESSIONALS, ASSISTED BY THE RESERVES TECHNICAL OVERSIGHT GROUP WHICH HAS

SIGNIFICANT TECHNICAL EXPERIENCE, CULMINATING IN REVIEWS WITH AND APPROVAL BY

SENIOR MANAGEMENT. NOTABLY, THE CORPORATION DOES NOT USE SPECIFIC QUANTITATIVE

RESERVE TARGETS TO DETERMINE COMPENSATION. KEY FEATURES OF THE RESERVE

ESTIMATION PROCESS ARE COVERED IN DISCLOSURE OF RESERVES IN ITEM 2.

ALTHOUGH

THE CORPORATION IS REASONABLY CERTAIN THAT PROVED RESERVES WILL BE PRODUCED,

THE TIMING AND AMOUNT RECOVERED CAN BE AFFECTED BY A NUMBER OF FACTORS

INCLUDING COMPLETION OF DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS, RESERVOIR PERFORMANCE, REGULATORY

APPROVALS AND SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN LONG-TERM OIL AND GAS PRICE LEVELS.

PROVED

RESERVES CAN BE FURTHER SUBDIVIDED INTO DEVELOPED AND UNDEVELOPED RESERVES. THE

PERCENTAGE OF PROVED DEVELOPED RESERVES WAS 73 PERCENT OF TOTAL PROVED RESERVES

AT YEAR-END 2015 (INCLUDING BOTH CONSOLIDATED AND EQUITY COMPANY RESERVES), AND

HAS BEEN OVER 60 PERCENT FOR THE LAST TEN YEARS.

REVISIONS

CAN INCLUDE UPWARD OR DOWNWARD CHANGES IN PREVIOUSLY ESTIMATED VOLUMES OF

PROVED RESERVES FOR EXISTING FIELDS DUE TO THE EVALUATION OR RE-EVALUATION OF

(1) ALREADY AVAILABLE GEOLOGIC, RESERVOIR OR PRODUCTION DATA, (2) NEW

GEOLOGIC, RESERVOIR OR PRODUCTION DATA OR (3) CHANGES IN PRICES AND YEAR-END

COSTS THAT ARE USED IN THE ESTIMATION OF RESERVES. REVISIONS CAN ALSO RESULT FROM

SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY OR PRODUCTION EQUIPMENT/FACILITY

CAPACITY.

WHEN

CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS PRICES ARE IN THE RANGE SEEN IN LATE 2015 AND EARLY

2016 FOR AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF TIME, UNDER THE SEC DEFINITION OF PROVED

RESERVES, CERTAIN QUANTITIES OF OIL AND NATURAL GAS, SUCH AS OIL SANDS

OPERATIONS IN CANADA AND NATURAL GAS OPERATIONS IN NORTH AMERICA COULD

TEMPORARILY NOT QUALIFY AS PROVED RESERVES. AMOUNTS THAT COULD BE REQUIRED TO

BE DE-BOOKED AS PROVED RESERVES ON AN SEC BASIS ARE SUBJECT TO BEING RE-BOOKED

AS PROVED RESERVES AT SOME POINT IN THE FUTURE WHEN PRICE LEVELS RECOVER, COSTS

DECLINE, OR OPERATING EFFICIENCIES OCCUR. UNDER THE TERMS OF CERTAIN

CONTRACTUAL ARRANGEMENTS OR GOVERNMENT ROYALTY REGIMES, LOWER PRICES CAN ALSO

INCREASE PROVED RESERVES ATTRIBUTABLE TO EXXONMOBIL. WE DO NOT EXPECT ANY

TEMPORARY CHANGES IN REPORTED PROVED RESERVES UNDER SEC DEFINITIONS TO AFFECT

THE OPERATION OF THE UNDERLYING PROJECTS OR TO ALTER OUR OUTLOOK FOR FUTURE

PRODUCTION VOLUMES.

56

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

IMPACT OF OIL AND GAS RESERVES ON DEPRECIATION.

THE CALCULATION OF UNIT-OF-PRODUCTION DEPRECIATION IS

A CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATE THAT MEASURES THE DEPRECIATION OF UPSTREAM ASSETS.

IT IS THE RATIO OF ACTUAL VOLUMES PRODUCED TO TOTAL PROVED RESERVES OR PROVED

DEVELOPED RESERVES (THOSE PROVED RESERVES RECOVERABLE THROUGH EXISTING WELLS

WITH EXISTING EQUIPMENT AND OPERATING METHODS), APPLIED TO THE ASSET COST. IN

THE EVENT THAT THE UNIT-OF-PRODUCTION METHOD DOES NOT RESULT IN AN EQUITABLE

ALLOCATION OF COST OVER THE ECONOMIC LIFE OF AN UPSTREAM ASSET, AN ALTERNATIVE

SUCH AS THE STRAIGHT-LINE METHOD IS USED. THE VOLUMES PRODUCED AND ASSET COST

ARE KNOWN AND, WHILE PROVED RESERVES HAVE A HIGH PROBABILITY OF RECOVERABILITY

THEY ARE BASED ON ESTIMATES THAT ARE SUBJECT TO SOME VARIABILITY. WHILE THE

REVISIONS THE CORPORATION HAS MADE IN THE PAST ARE AN INDICATOR OF VARIABILITY,

THEY HAVE HAD A VERY SMALL IMPACT ON THE UNIT-OF-PRODUCTION RATES BECAUSE THEY

HAVE BEEN SMALL COMPARED TO THE LARGE RESERVES BASE.

IMPACT

OF OIL AND GAS RESERVES, PRICES AND MARGINS ON TESTING FOR IMPAIRMENT.

THE CORPORATION PERFORMS IMPAIRMENT ASSESSMENTS

WHENEVER EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THAT THE CARRYING AMOUNTS OF ITS

LONG-LIVED ASSETS (OR GROUP OF ASSETS) MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE THROUGH FUTURE

OPERATIONS OR DISPOSITION. ASSETS ARE GROUPED AT THE LOWEST LEVEL FOR WHICH

THERE ARE IDENTIFIABLE CASH FLOWS THAT ARE LARGELY INDEPENDENT OF THE CASH

FLOWS OF OTHER GROUPS OF ASSETS FOR THIS ASSESSMENT.

POTENTIAL

TRIGGER EVENTS FOR IMPAIRMENT EVALUATION INCLUDE.

·

A SIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN THE

MARKET PRICE OF A LONG-LIVED ASSET;

·

A SIGNIFICANT ADVERSE CHANGE IN

THE EXTENT OR MANNER IN WHICH AN ASSET IS BEING USED OR IN ITS PHYSICAL

CONDITION INCLUDING A SIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN CURRENT AND PROJECTED RESERVE

VOLUMES;

·

A SIGNIFICANT ADVERSE CHANGE IN

LEGAL FACTORS OR IN THE BUSINESS CLIMATE THAT COULD AFFECT THE VALUE, INCLUDING

AN ADVERSE ACTION OR ASSESSMENT BY A REGULATOR;

·

AN ACCUMULATION OF PROJECT COSTS

SIGNIFICANTLY IN EXCESS OF THE AMOUNT ORIGINALLY EXPECTED;

·

A CURRENT-PERIOD OPERATING LOSS

COMBINED WITH A HISTORY AND FORECAST OF OPERATING OR CASH FLOW LOSSES; AND

·

A CURRENT EXPECTATION THAT, MORE

LIKELY THAN NOT, A LONG-LIVED ASSET WILL BE SOLD OR OTHERWISE DISPOSED OF

SIGNIFICANTLY BEFORE THE END OF ITS PREVIOUSLY ESTIMATED USEFUL LIFE.

THE

CORPORATION PERFORMS ASSET VALUATION ANALYSES ON AN ONGOING BASIS AS A PART OF

ITS ASSET MANAGEMENT PROGRAM. THESE ANALYSES AND OTHER PROFITABILITY REVIEWS

ASSIST THE CORPORATION IN ASSESSING WHETHER THE CARRYING AMOUNTS OF ANY OF ITS

ASSETS MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE.

IN

GENERAL, THE CORPORATION DOES NOT VIEW TEMPORARILY LOW PRICES OR MARGINS AS A

TRIGGER EVENT FOR CONDUCTING IMPAIRMENT TESTS. THE MARKETS FOR CRUDE OIL,

NATURAL GAS AND PETROLEUM PRODUCTS HAVE A HISTORY OF SIGNIFICANT PRICE

VOLATILITY. ALTHOUGH PRICES WILL OCCASIONALLY DROP SIGNIFICANTLY, INDUSTRY

PRICES OVER THE LONG TERM WILL CONTINUE TO BE DRIVEN BY MARKET SUPPLY AND

DEMAND. ON THE SUPPLY SIDE, INDUSTRY PRODUCTION FROM MATURE FIELDS IS

DECLINING, BUT THIS IS BEING OFFSET BY PRODUCTION FROM NEW DISCOVERIES AND

FIELD DEVELOPMENTS. OPEC PRODUCTION POLICIES ALSO HAVE AN IMPACT ON WORLD OIL

SUPPLIES. THE DEMAND SIDE IS LARGELY A FUNCTION OF GLOBAL ECONOMIC GROWTH. THE

RELATIVE GROWTH/DECLINE IN SUPPLY VERSUS DEMAND WILL DETERMINE INDUSTRY PRICES

OVER THE LONG TERM, AND THESE CANNOT BE ACCURATELY PREDICTED.

IF

THERE WERE A TRIGGER EVENT, THE CORPORATION ESTIMATES THE FUTURE UNDISCOUNTED

CASH FLOWS OF THE AFFECTED PROPERTIES TO JUDGE THE RECOVERABILITY OF CARRYING

AMOUNTS. CASH FLOWS USED IN IMPAIRMENT EVALUATIONS ARE DEVELOPED USING

ESTIMATES FOR FUTURE CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS COMMODITY PRICES, REFINING AND

CHEMICAL MARGINS, AND FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES. VOLUMES ARE BASED ON

PROJECTED FIELD AND FACILITY PRODUCTION PROFILES, THROUGHPUT, OR SALES. THESE

EVALUATIONS MAKE USE OF THE CORPORATION’S PRICE, MARGIN, VOLUME, AND COST

ASSUMPTIONS DEVELOPED IN THE ANNUAL PLANNING AND BUDGETING PROCESS, AND ARE

CONSISTENT WITH THE CRITERIA MANAGEMENT USES TO EVALUATE INVESTMENT

OPPORTUNITIES. WHERE UNPROVED RESERVES EXIST, AN APPROPRIATELY RISK-ADJUSTED

AMOUNT OF THESE RESERVES MAY BE INCLUDED IN THE EVALUATION.

AN

ASSET GROUP WOULD BE IMPAIRED IF ITS UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS WERE LESS THAN THE

ASSET’S CARRYING VALUE. IMPAIRMENTS ARE MEASURED BY THE AMOUNT BY WHICH THE

CARRYING VALUE EXCEEDS FAIR VALUE. CASH FLOW ESTIMATES FOR IMPAIRMENT TESTING

EXCLUDE THE EFFECTS OF DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS.

IN

LIGHT OF CONTINUED WEAKNESS IN THE UPSTREAM INDUSTRY ENVIRONMENT IN LATE 2015,

THE CORPORATION UNDERTOOK AN EFFORT TO ASSESS ITS MAJOR LONG-LIVED ASSETS MOST

AT RISK FOR POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT. THE RESULTS OF THIS ASSESSMENT CONFIRM THE

ABSENCE OF A TRIGGER EVENT AND INDICATE THAT THE FUTURE UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS

ASSOCIATED WITH THESE ASSETS SUBSTANTIALLY EXCEED THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE

ASSETS. THE ASSESSMENT REFLECTS CRUDE AND NATURAL GAS PRICES THAT ARE GENERALLY

CONSISTENT WITH THE LONG-TERM PRICE FORECASTS PUBLISHED BY THIRD-PARTY INDUSTRY

EXPERTS. CRITICAL TO THE LONG-TERM RECOVERABILITY OF CERTAIN ASSETS IS THE

ASSUMPTION THAT EITHER BY SUPPLY AND DEMAND CHANGES, OR DUE TO GENERAL

INFLATION, PRICES WILL RISE IN THE FUTURE. SHOULD INCREASES IN LONG-TERM PRICES

NOT MATERIALIZE, CERTAIN OF THE CORPORATION’S ASSETS WILL BE AT RISK FOR

IMPAIRMENT. DUE TO THE INHERENT DIFFICULTY IN PREDICTING FUTURE COMMODITY

PRICES, AND THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN INDUSTRY PRICES AND COSTS, IT IS NOT

PRACTICABLE TO REASONABLY ESTIMATE A RANGE OF POTENTIAL FUTURE IMPAIRMENTS

RELATED TO THE CORPORATION’S LONG-LIVED ASSETS.

SIGNIFICANT

UNPROVED PROPERTIES ARE ASSESSED FOR IMPAIRMENT INDIVIDUALLY, AND VALUATION

ALLOWANCES AGAINST THE CAPITALIZED COSTS ARE RECORDED BASED ON THE ESTIMATED

ECONOMIC CHANCE OF SUCCESS AND THE LENGTH OF TIME THAT THE CORPORATION EXPECTS

TO HOLD THE

57

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

PROPERTIES. PROPERTIES THAT ARE NOT

INDIVIDUALLY SIGNIFICANT ARE AGGREGATED BY GROUPS AND AMORTIZED BASED ON

DEVELOPMENT RISK AND AVERAGE HOLDING PERIOD.

SUPPLEMENTAL

INFORMATION REGARDING OIL AND GAS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, CAPITALIZED COSTS AND

RESERVES IS PROVIDED FOLLOWING THE NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

FUTURE PRICES USED FOR ANY IMPAIRMENT TESTS WILL VARY FROM THE ONES USED IN THE

SUPPLEMENTAL OIL AND GAS DISCLOSURE AND COULD BE LOWER OR HIGHER FOR ANY GIVEN

YEAR.

INVENTORIES

CRUDE

OIL, PRODUCTS AND MERCHANDISE INVENTORIES ARE CARRIED AT THE LOWER OF CURRENT

MARKET VALUE OR COST (GENERALLY DETERMINED UNDER THE LAST-IN, FIRST-OUT METHOD

– LIFO). IF CRUDE OIL, NATURAL GAS, PETROLEUM PRODUCT AND CHEMICAL PRODUCT

PRICES CONTINUE IN THE RANGE SEEN IN EARLY 2016, THE CORPORATION COULD BE

SUBJECT TO A LOWER OF COST OR MARKET INVENTORY VALUATION ADJUSTMENT.

ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS

THE

CORPORATION INCURS RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS FOR CERTAIN ASSETS. THE FAIR VALUES

OF THESE OBLIGATIONS ARE RECORDED AS LIABILITIES ON A DISCOUNTED BASIS, WHICH

IS TYPICALLY AT THE TIME THE ASSETS ARE INSTALLED. IN THE ESTIMATION OF FAIR

VALUE, THE CORPORATION USES ASSUMPTIONS AND JUDGMENTS REGARDING SUCH FACTORS AS

THE EXISTENCE OF A LEGAL OBLIGATION FOR AN ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATION;

TECHNICAL ASSESSMENTS OF THE ASSETS; ESTIMATED AMOUNTS AND TIMING OF

SETTLEMENTS; DISCOUNT RATES; AND INFLATION RATES. ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS

ARE DISCLOSED IN NOTE 9 TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

SUSPENDED EXPLORATORY WELL COSTS

THE

CORPORATION CONTINUES CAPITALIZATION OF EXPLORATORY WELL COSTS WHEN THE WELL

HAS FOUND A SUFFICIENT QUANTITY OF RESERVES TO JUSTIFY ITS COMPLETION AS A

PRODUCING WELL AND THE CORPORATION IS MAKING SUFFICIENT PROGRESS ASSESSING THE

RESERVES AND THE ECONOMIC AND OPERATING VIABILITY OF THE PROJECT. EXPLORATORY

WELL COSTS NOT MEETING THESE CRITERIA ARE CHARGED TO EXPENSE. THE FACTS AND

CIRCUMSTANCES THAT SUPPORT CONTINUED CAPITALIZATION OF SUSPENDED WELLS AT YEAR-END

ARE DISCLOSED IN NOTE 10 TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

CONSOLIDATIONS

THE

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDE THE ACCOUNTS OF THOSE SUBSIDIARIES

THAT THE CORPORATION CONTROLS. THEY ALSO INCLUDE THE CORPORATION’S SHARE OF THE

UNDIVIDED INTEREST IN CERTAIN UPSTREAM ASSETS, LIABILITIES, REVENUES AND

EXPENSES. AMOUNTS REPRESENTING THE CORPORATION’S INTEREST IN THE UNDERLYING NET

ASSETS OF OTHER SIGNIFICANT ENTITIES THAT IT DOES NOT CONTROL, BUT OVER WHICH

IT EXERCISES SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE, ARE ACCOUNTED FOR USING THE EQUITY METHOD

OF ACCOUNTING.

INVESTMENTS

IN COMPANIES THAT ARE PARTIALLY OWNED BY THE CORPORATION ARE INTEGRAL TO THE

CORPORATION’S OPERATIONS. IN SOME CASES THEY SERVE TO BALANCE WORLDWIDE RISKS,

AND IN OTHERS THEY PROVIDE THE ONLY AVAILABLE MEANS OF ENTRY INTO A PARTICULAR

MARKET OR AREA OF INTEREST. THE OTHER PARTIES, WHO ALSO HAVE AN EQUITY INTEREST

IN THESE COMPANIES, ARE EITHER INDEPENDENT THIRD PARTIES OR HOST GOVERNMENTS

THAT SHARE IN THE BUSINESS RESULTS ACCORDING TO THEIR OWNERSHIP. THE

CORPORATION DOES NOT INVEST IN THESE COMPANIES IN ORDER TO REMOVE LIABILITIES

FROM ITS BALANCE SHEET. IN FACT, THE CORPORATION HAS LONG BEEN ON RECORD

SUPPORTING AN ALTERNATIVE ACCOUNTING METHOD THAT WOULD REQUIRE EACH INVESTOR TO

CONSOLIDATE ITS SHARE OF ALL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES IN THESE PARTIALLY-OWNED

COMPANIES RATHER THAN ONLY ITS INTEREST IN NET EQUITY. THIS METHOD OF

ACCOUNTING FOR INVESTMENTS IN PARTIALLY-OWNED COMPANIES IS NOT PERMITTED BY U.S.

GAAP EXCEPT WHERE THE INVESTMENTS ARE IN THE DIRECT OWNERSHIP OF A SHARE OF

UPSTREAM ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. HOWEVER, FOR PURPOSES OF CALCULATING RETURN ON

AVERAGE CAPITAL EMPLOYED, WHICH IS NOT COVERED BY U.S. GAAP STANDARDS, THE

CORPORATION INCLUDES ITS SHARE OF DEBT OF THESE PARTIALLY-OWNED COMPANIES IN

THE DETERMINATION OF AVERAGE CAPITAL EMPLOYED.

58

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

PENSION

BENEFITS

THE

CORPORATION AND ITS AFFILIATES SPONSOR ABOUT 100 DEFINED BENEFIT (PENSION)

PLANS IN OVER 40 COUNTRIES. THE PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS FOOTNOTE

(NOTE 17) PROVIDES DETAILS ON PENSION OBLIGATIONS, FUND ASSETS AND PENSION

EXPENSE.

SOME

OF THESE PLANS (PRIMARILY NON-U.S.) PROVIDE PENSION BENEFITS THAT ARE PAID

DIRECTLY BY THEIR SPONSORING AFFILIATES OUT OF CORPORATE CASH FLOW RATHER THAN

A SEPARATE PENSION FUND BECAUSE TAX CONVENTIONS AND REGULATORY PRACTICES DO NOT

ENCOURAGE ADVANCE FUNDING. BOOK RESERVES ARE ESTABLISHED FOR THESE PLANS. THE

PORTION OF THE PENSION COST ATTRIBUTABLE TO EMPLOYEE SERVICE IS EXPENSED AS SERVICES

ARE RENDERED. THE PORTION ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE INCREASE IN PENSION OBLIGATIONS

DUE TO THE PASSAGE OF TIME IS EXPENSED OVER THE TERM OF THE OBLIGATIONS, WHICH

ENDS WHEN ALL BENEFITS ARE PAID. THE PRIMARY DIFFERENCE IN PENSION EXPENSE FOR

UNFUNDED VERSUS FUNDED PLANS IS THAT PENSION EXPENSE FOR FUNDED PLANS ALSO

INCLUDES A CREDIT FOR THE EXPECTED LONG-TERM RETURN ON FUND ASSETS.

FOR

FUNDED PLANS, INCLUDING THOSE IN THE U.S., PENSION OBLIGATIONS ARE FINANCED IN

ADVANCE THROUGH SEGREGATED ASSETS OR INSURANCE ARRANGEMENTS. THESE PLANS ARE

MANAGED IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE REQUIREMENTS OF GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORITIES AND

MEET OR EXCEED REQUIRED FUNDING LEVELS AS MEASURED BY RELEVANT ACTUARIAL AND

GOVERNMENT STANDARDS AT THE MANDATED MEASUREMENT DATES. IN DETERMINING

LIABILITIES AND REQUIRED CONTRIBUTIONS, THESE STANDARDS OFTEN REQUIRE

APPROACHES AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT DIFFER FROM THOSE USED FOR ACCOUNTING PURPOSES.

THE

CORPORATION WILL CONTINUE TO MAKE CONTRIBUTIONS TO THESE FUNDED PLANS AS

NECESSARY. ALL DEFINED-BENEFIT PENSION OBLIGATIONS, REGARDLESS OF THE FUNDING

STATUS OF THE UNDERLYING PLANS, ARE FULLY SUPPORTED BY THE FINANCIAL STRENGTH

OF THE CORPORATION OR THE RESPECTIVE SPONSORING AFFILIATE.

PENSION

ACCOUNTING REQUIRES EXPLICIT ASSUMPTIONS REGARDING, AMONG OTHERS, THE LONG-TERM

EXPECTED EARNINGS RATE ON FUND ASSETS, THE DISCOUNT RATE FOR THE BENEFIT

OBLIGATIONS AND THE LONG-TERM RATE FOR FUTURE SALARY INCREASES. PENSION

ASSUMPTIONS ARE REVIEWED ANNUALLY BY OUTSIDE ACTUARIES AND SENIOR MANAGEMENT.

THESE ASSUMPTIONS ARE ADJUSTED AS APPROPRIATE TO REFLECT CHANGES IN MARKET

RATES AND OUTLOOK. THE LONG-TERM EXPECTED EARNINGS RATE ON U.S. PENSION PLAN

ASSETS IN 2015 WAS 7.00 PERCENT. THE 10‐YEAR AND 20‐YEAR ACTUAL

RETURNS ON U.S. PENSION PLAN ASSETS WERE 5 PERCENT AND 8 PERCENT, RESPECTIVELY.

THE CORPORATION ESTABLISHES THE LONG-TERM EXPECTED RATE OF RETURN BY DEVELOPING

A FORWARD-LOOKING, LONG-TERM RETURN ASSUMPTION FOR EACH PENSION FUND ASSET

CLASS, TAKING INTO ACCOUNT FACTORS SUCH AS THE EXPECTED REAL RETURN FOR THE

SPECIFIC ASSET CLASS AND INFLATION. A SINGLE, LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN IS THEN

CALCULATED AS THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE OF THE TARGET ASSET ALLOCATION PERCENTAGES

AND THE LONG-TERM RETURN ASSUMPTION FOR EACH ASSET CLASS. A WORLDWIDE REDUCTION

OF 0.5 PERCENT IN THE LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN ON ASSETS WOULD INCREASE ANNUAL PENSION

EXPENSE BY APPROXIMATELY $150 MILLION BEFORE TAX.

DIFFERENCES

BETWEEN ACTUAL RETURNS ON FUND ASSETS AND THE LONG-TERM EXPECTED RETURN ARE NOT

RECOGNIZED IN PENSION EXPENSE IN THE YEAR THAT THE DIFFERENCE OCCURS. SUCH

DIFFERENCES ARE DEFERRED, ALONG WITH OTHER ACTUARIAL GAINS AND LOSSES, AND ARE

AMORTIZED INTO PENSION EXPENSE OVER THE EXPECTED REMAINING SERVICE LIFE OF

EMPLOYEES.

LITIGATION CONTINGENCIES

A

VARIETY OF CLAIMS HAVE BEEN MADE AGAINST THE CORPORATION AND CERTAIN OF ITS

CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES IN A NUMBER OF PENDING LAWSUITS. MANAGEMENT HAS

REGULAR LITIGATION REVIEWS, INCLUDING UPDATES FROM CORPORATE AND OUTSIDE

COUNSEL, TO ASSESS THE NEED FOR ACCOUNTING RECOGNITION OR DISCLOSURE OF THESE

CONTINGENCIES. THE STATUS OF SIGNIFICANT CLAIMS IS SUMMARIZED IN NOTE 16.

THE

CORPORATION ACCRUES AN UNDISCOUNTED LIABILITY FOR THOSE CONTINGENCIES WHERE THE

INCURRENCE OF A LOSS IS PROBABLE, AND THE AMOUNT CAN BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED.

THESE AMOUNTS ARE NOT REDUCED BY AMOUNTS THAT MAY BE RECOVERED UNDER INSURANCE

OR CLAIMS AGAINST THIRD PARTIES, BUT UNDISCOUNTED RECEIVABLES FROM INSURERS OR

OTHER THIRD PARTIES MAY BE ACCRUED SEPARATELY. THE CORPORATION REVISES SUCH

ACCRUALS IN LIGHT OF NEW INFORMATION. FOR CONTINGENCIES WHERE AN UNFAVORABLE

OUTCOME IS REASONABLY POSSIBLE AND WHICH ARE SIGNIFICANT, THE CORPORATION

DISCLOSES THE NATURE OF THE CONTINGENCY AND, WHERE FEASIBLE, AN ESTIMATE OF THE

POSSIBLE LOSS. FOR PURPOSES OF OUR LITIGATION CONTINGENCY DISCLOSURES,

“SIGNIFICANT” INCLUDES MATERIAL MATTERS AS WELL AS OTHER ITEMS WHICH MANAGEMENT

BELIEVES SHOULD BE DISCLOSED.

MANAGEMENT

JUDGMENT IS REQUIRED RELATED TO CONTINGENT LIABILITIES AND THE OUTCOME OF

LITIGATION BECAUSE BOTH ARE DIFFICULT TO PREDICT. HOWEVER, THE CORPORATION HAS

BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN DEFENDING LITIGATION IN THE PAST. PAYMENTS HAVE NOT HAD A

MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OPERATIONS OR FINANCIAL CONDITION. IN THE

CORPORATION’S EXPERIENCE, LARGE CLAIMS OFTEN DO NOT RESULT IN LARGE AWARDS.

LARGE AWARDS ARE OFTEN REVERSED OR SUBSTANTIALLY REDUCED AS A RESULT OF APPEAL

OR SETTLEMENT.

59

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

TAX

CONTINGENCIES

THE

CORPORATION IS SUBJECT TO INCOME TAXATION IN MANY JURISDICTIONS AROUND THE

WORLD. SIGNIFICANT MANAGEMENT JUDGMENT IS REQUIRED IN THE ACCOUNTING FOR INCOME

TAX CONTINGENCIES AND TAX DISPUTES BECAUSE THE OUTCOMES ARE OFTEN DIFFICULT TO

PREDICT.

THE BENEFITS OF UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS

THAT THE CORPORATION HAS TAKEN OR EXPECTS TO TAKE IN ITS INCOME TAX RETURNS ARE

RECOGNIZED IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IF MANAGEMENT CONCLUDES THAT IT IS MORE

LIKELY THAN NOT THAT THE POSITION WILL BE SUSTAINED WITH THE TAX AUTHORITIES.

FOR A POSITION THAT IS LIKELY TO BE SUSTAINED, THE BENEFIT RECOGNIZED IN THE

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IS MEASURED AT THE LARGEST AMOUNT THAT IS GREATER THAN 50

PERCENT LIKELY OF BEING REALIZED. A RESERVE IS ESTABLISHED FOR THE DIFFERENCE

BETWEEN A POSITION TAKEN OR EXPECTED TO BE TAKEN IN AN INCOME TAX RETURN AND

THE AMOUNT RECOGNIZED IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. THE CORPORATION’S

UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS AND A DESCRIPTION OF OPEN TAX YEARS ARE SUMMARIZED IN

NOTE 19.

FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION

THE

METHOD OF TRANSLATING THE FOREIGN CURRENCY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF THE

CORPORATION’S INTERNATIONAL SUBSIDIARIES INTO U.S. DOLLARS IS PRESCRIBED BY

GAAP. UNDER THESE PRINCIPLES, IT IS NECESSARY TO SELECT THE FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY

OF THESE SUBSIDIARIES. THE FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY IS THE CURRENCY OF THE PRIMARY

ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH THE SUBSIDIARY OPERATES. MANAGEMENT SELECTS THE

FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY AFTER EVALUATING THIS ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT.

FACTORS

CONSIDERED BY MANAGEMENT WHEN DETERMINING THE FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY FOR A

SUBSIDIARY INCLUDE THE CURRENCY USED FOR CASH FLOWS RELATED TO INDIVIDUAL ASSETS

AND LIABILITIES; THE RESPONSIVENESS OF SALES PRICES TO CHANGES IN EXCHANGE

RATES; THE HISTORY OF INFLATION IN THE COUNTRY; WHETHER SALES ARE INTO LOCAL

MARKETS OR EXPORTED; THE CURRENCY USED TO ACQUIRE RAW MATERIALS, LABOR,

SERVICES AND SUPPLIES; SOURCES OF FINANCING; AND SIGNIFICANCE OF INTERCOMPANY

TRANSACTIONS.

MANAGEMENT’S

REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

MANAGEMENT, INCLUDING THE

CORPORATION’S CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, PRINCIPAL FINANCIAL OFFICER, AND PRINCIPAL

ACCOUNTING OFFICER, IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ESTABLISHING AND MAINTAINING ADEQUATE

INTERNAL CONTROL OVER THE CORPORATION’S FINANCIAL REPORTING. MANAGEMENT

CONDUCTED AN EVALUATION OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL

REPORTING BASED ON CRITERIA ESTABLISHED IN

INTERNAL CONTROL –

INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK (2013)

ISSUED BY THE COMMITTEE OF SPONSORING

ORGANIZATIONS OF THE TREADWAY COMMISSION. BASED ON THIS EVALUATION, MANAGEMENT

CONCLUDED THAT EXXON MOBIL CORPORATION’S INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL

REPORTING WAS EFFECTIVE AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2015.

PRICEWATERHOUSECOOPERS

TO THE SHAREHOLDERS OF EXXON

MOBIL CORPORATION.

IN OUR OPINION, THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED BALANCE

SHEETS AND THE RELATED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME, COMPREHENSIVE INCOME,

CHANGES IN EQUITY, AND CASH FLOWS PRESENT FAIRLY, IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS, THE

FINANCIAL POSITION OF EXXON MOBIL CORPORATION AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES AT

DECEMBER 31, 2015 AND 2014, AND THE RESULTS OF THEIR OPERATIONS AND THEIR

CASH FLOWS FOR EACH OF THE THREE YEARS IN THE PERIOD ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2015

IN CONFORMITY WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED

STATES OF AMERICA. ALSO IN OUR OPINION, THE CORPORATION MAINTAINED, IN ALL

MATERIAL RESPECTS, EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2015, BASED ON CRITERIA ESTABLISHED IN

INTERNAL CONTROL –

INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK (2013)

ISSUED BY THE COMMITTEE OF SPONSORING

ORGANIZATIONS OF THE TREADWAY COMMISSION (COSO). THE CORPORATION’S MANAGEMENT

IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, FOR MAINTAINING EFFECTIVE

INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AND FOR ITS ASSESSMENT OF THE

EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, INCLUDED IN THE

ACCOMPANYING MANAGEMENT’S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING.

OUR RESPONSIBILITY IS TO EXPRESS OPINIONS ON THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND ON

THE CORPORATION’S INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING BASED ON OUR

INTEGRATED AUDITS. WE CONDUCTED OUR AUDITS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE STANDARDS OF

THE PUBLIC COMPANY ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BOARD (UNITED STATES). THOSE STANDARDS

REQUIRE THAT WE PLAN AND PERFORM THE AUDITS TO OBTAIN REASONABLE ASSURANCE

ABOUT WHETHER THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE FREE OF MATERIAL MISSTATEMENT AND

WHETHER EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING WAS MAINTAINED IN

ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS. OUR AUDITS OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED

EXAMINING, ON A TEST BASIS, EVIDENCE SUPPORTING THE AMOUNTS AND DISCLOSURES IN

THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, ASSESSING THE ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES USED AND

SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES MADE BY MANAGEMENT, AND EVALUATING THE OVERALL FINANCIAL

STATEMENT PRESENTATION. OUR AUDIT OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

INCLUDED OBTAINING AN UNDERSTANDING OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL

REPORTING, ASSESSING THE RISK THAT A MATERIAL WEAKNESS EXISTS, AND TESTING AND

EVALUATING THE DESIGN AND OPERATING EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL CONTROL BASED ON

THE ASSESSED RISK. OUR AUDITS ALSO INCLUDED PERFORMING SUCH OTHER PROCEDURES AS

WE CONSIDERED NECESSARY IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR AUDITS

PROVIDE A REASONABLE BASIS FOR OUR OPINIONS.

A COMPANY’S INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING IS A

PROCESS DESIGNED TO PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING THE RELIABILITY OF

FINANCIAL REPORTING AND THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR EXTERNAL

PURPOSES IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES. A

COMPANY’S INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING INCLUDES THOSE POLICIES AND

PROCEDURES THAT (I) PERTAIN TO THE MAINTENANCE OF RECORDS THAT, IN

REASONABLE DETAIL, ACCURATELY AND FAIRLY REFLECT THE TRANSACTIONS AND

DISPOSITIONS OF THE ASSETS OF THE COMPANY; (II) PROVIDE REASONABLE

ASSURANCE THAT TRANSACTIONS ARE RECORDED AS NECESSARY TO PERMIT PREPARATION OF

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING

PRINCIPLES, AND THAT RECEIPTS AND EXPENDITURES OF THE COMPANY ARE BEING MADE

ONLY IN ACCORDANCE WITH AUTHORIZATIONS OF MANAGEMENT AND DIRECTORS OF THE COMPANY;

AND (III) PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING PREVENTION OR TIMELY

DETECTION OF UNAUTHORIZED ACQUISITION, USE, OR DISPOSITION OF THE COMPANY’S

ASSETS THAT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

BECAUSE OF ITS INHERENT LIMITATIONS, INTERNAL CONTROL OVER

FINANCIAL REPORTING MAY NOT PREVENT OR DETECT MISSTATEMENTS. ALSO, PROJECTIONS

OF ANY EVALUATION OF EFFECTIVENESS TO FUTURE PERIODS ARE SUBJECT TO THE RISK

THAT CONTROLS MAY BECOME INADEQUATE BECAUSE OF CHANGES IN CONDITIONS, OR THAT

THE DEGREE OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE POLICIES OR PROCEDURES MAY DETERIORATE.

THE

INFORMATION IN THE NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IS AN INTEGRAL

PART OF THESE STATEMENTS.

67

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS AND THE SUPPORTING AND SUPPLEMENTAL MATERIAL ARE THE RESPONSIBILITY

OF THE MANAGEMENT OF EXXON MOBIL CORPORATION.

THE

CORPORATION’S PRINCIPAL BUSINESS IS ENERGY, INVOLVING THE WORLDWIDE

EXPLORATION, PRODUCTION, TRANSPORTATION AND SALE OF CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS

(UPSTREAM) AND THE MANUFACTURE, TRANSPORTATION AND SALE OF PETROLEUM PRODUCTS

(DOWNSTREAM). THE CORPORATION IS ALSO A MAJOR WORLDWIDE MANUFACTURER AND

MARKETER OF PETROCHEMICALS (CHEMICAL).

THE

PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN CONFORMITY WITH U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED

ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES (GAAP) REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO MAKE ESTIMATES THAT AFFECT

THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS, LIABILITIES, REVENUES AND EXPENSES AND THE

DISCLOSURE OF CONTINGENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. ACTUAL RESULTS COULD DIFFER

FROM THESE ESTIMATES. PRIOR YEARS’ DATA HAS BEEN RECLASSIFIED IN CERTAIN CASES

TO CONFORM TO THE 2015 PRESENTATION BASIS.

1.

SUMMARY OF ACCOUNTING POLICIES

PRINCIPLES

OF CONSOLIDATION.

THE

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDE THE ACCOUNTS OF SUBSIDIARIES THE

CORPORATION CONTROLS. THEY ALSO INCLUDE THE CORPORATION’S SHARE OF THE

UNDIVIDED INTEREST IN CERTAIN UPSTREAM ASSETS, LIABILITIES, REVENUES AND

EXPENSES.

AMOUNTS

REPRESENTING THE CORPORATION’S INTEREST IN ENTITIES THAT IT DOES NOT CONTROL,

BUT OVER WHICH IT EXERCISES SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE, ARE INCLUDED IN

“INVESTMENTS, ADVANCES AND LONG-TERM RECEIVABLES.” THE CORPORATION’S SHARE OF

THE NET INCOME OF THESE COMPANIES IS INCLUDED IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF

INCOME CAPTION “INCOME FROM EQUITY AFFILIATES.”

MAJORITY

OWNERSHIP IS NORMALLY THE INDICATOR OF CONTROL THAT IS THE BASIS ON WHICH

SUBSIDIARIES ARE CONSOLIDATED. HOWEVER, CERTAIN FACTORS MAY INDICATE THAT A

MAJORITY-OWNED INVESTMENT IS NOT CONTROLLED AND THEREFORE SHOULD BE ACCOUNTED

FOR USING THE EQUITY METHOD OF ACCOUNTING. THESE FACTORS OCCUR WHERE THE

MINORITY SHAREHOLDERS ARE GRANTED BY LAW OR BY CONTRACT SUBSTANTIVE

PARTICIPATING RIGHTS. THESE INCLUDE THE RIGHT TO APPROVE OPERATING POLICIES,

EXPENSE BUDGETS, FINANCING AND INVESTMENT PLANS, AND MANAGEMENT COMPENSATION

AND SUCCESSION PLANS.

THE

CORPORATION’S SHARE OF THE CUMULATIVE FOREIGN EXCHANGE TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENT

FOR EQUITY METHOD INVESTMENTS IS REPORTED IN ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE

INCOME.

EVIDENCE

OF LOSS IN VALUE THAT MIGHT INDICATE IMPAIRMENT OF INVESTMENTS IN COMPANIES

ACCOUNTED FOR ON THE EQUITY METHOD IS ASSESSED TO DETERMINE IF SUCH EVIDENCE

REPRESENTS A LOSS IN VALUE OF THE CORPORATION’S INVESTMENT THAT IS OTHER THAN

TEMPORARY. EXAMPLES OF KEY INDICATORS INCLUDE A HISTORY OF OPERATING LOSSES,

NEGATIVE EARNINGS AND CASH FLOW OUTLOOK, SIGNIFICANT DOWNWARD REVISIONS TO OIL

AND GAS RESERVES, AND THE FINANCIAL CONDITION AND PROSPECTS FOR THE INVESTEE’S

BUSINESS SEGMENT OR GEOGRAPHIC REGION. IF EVIDENCE OF AN OTHER THAN TEMPORARY

LOSS IN FAIR VALUE BELOW CARRYING AMOUNT IS DETERMINED, AN IMPAIRMENT IS

RECOGNIZED. IN THE ABSENCE OF MARKET PRICES FOR THE INVESTMENT, DISCOUNTED CASH

FLOWS ARE USED TO ASSESS FAIR VALUE.

REVENUE RECOGNITION.

THE

CORPORATION GENERALLY SELLS CRUDE OIL, NATURAL GAS AND PETROLEUM AND CHEMICAL

PRODUCTS UNDER SHORT-TERM AGREEMENTS AT PREVAILING MARKET PRICES. IN SOME CASES

(E.G., NATURAL GAS), PRODUCTS MAY BE SOLD UNDER LONG-TERM AGREEMENTS, WITH

PERIODIC PRICE ADJUSTMENTS. REVENUES ARE RECOGNIZED WHEN THE PRODUCTS ARE

DELIVERED, WHICH OCCURS WHEN THE CUSTOMER HAS TAKEN TITLE AND HAS ASSUMED THE

RISKS AND REWARDS OF OWNERSHIP, PRICES ARE FIXED OR DETERMINABLE AND

COLLECTIBILITY IS REASONABLY ASSURED.

REVENUES

FROM THE PRODUCTION OF NATURAL GAS PROPERTIES IN WHICH THE CORPORATION HAS AN

INTEREST WITH OTHER PRODUCERS ARE RECOGNIZED ON THE BASIS OF THE CORPORATION’S

NET WORKING INTEREST. DIFFERENCES BETWEEN ACTUAL PRODUCTION AND NET WORKING

INTEREST VOLUMES ARE NOT SIGNIFICANT.

PURCHASES

AND SALES OF INVENTORY WITH THE SAME COUNTERPARTY THAT ARE ENTERED INTO IN

CONTEMPLATION OF ONE ANOTHER ARE COMBINED AND RECORDED AS EXCHANGES MEASURED AT

THE BOOK VALUE OF THE ITEM SOLD.

SALES-BASED TAXES.

THE

CORPORATION REPORTS SALES, EXCISE AND VALUE-ADDED TAXES ON SALES TRANSACTIONS

ON A GROSS BASIS IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF INCOME (INCLUDED IN BOTH

REVENUES AND COSTS).

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS.

THE

CORPORATION MAKES LIMITED USE OF DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS. THE CORPORATION DOES

NOT ENGAGE IN SPECULATIVE DERIVATIVE ACTIVITIES OR DERIVATIVE TRADING

ACTIVITIES, NOR DOES IT USE DERIVATIVES WITH LEVERAGED FEATURES. WHEN THE

CORPORATION DOES ENTER INTO DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS, IT IS TO OFFSET EXPOSURES

ASSOCIATED WITH INTEREST RATES, FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES AND HYDROCARBON

PRICES THAT ARISE FROM EXISTING ASSETS, LIABILITIES AND FORECASTED

TRANSACTIONS.

THE

GAINS AND LOSSES RESULTING FROM CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF DERIVATIVES ARE

RECORDED IN INCOME. IN SOME CASES, THE CORPORATION DESIGNATES DERIVATIVES AS

FAIR VALUE HEDGES, IN WHICH CASE THE GAINS AND LOSSES ARE OFFSET IN INCOME BY

THE GAINS AND LOSSES ARISING FROM CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE UNDERLYING

HEDGED ITEM.

FAIR VALUE.

FAIR VALUE IS THE

PRICE THAT WOULD BE RECEIVED TO SELL AN ASSET OR PAID TO TRANSFER A LIABILITY

IN AN ORDERLY TRANSACTION BETWEEN MARKET PARTICIPANTS. HIERARCHY LEVELS 1, 2

AND 3 ARE TERMS FOR THE PRIORITY OF INPUTS TO VALUATION TECHNIQUES USED TO

MEASURE FAIR VALUE. HIERARCHY LEVEL 1 INPUTS ARE QUOTED PRICES IN ACTIVE

MARKETS FOR IDENTICAL ASSETS OR LIABILITIES. HIERARCHY

68

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

LEVEL 2

INPUTS ARE INPUTS OTHER THAN QUOTED PRICES INCLUDED WITHIN LEVEL 1 THAT

ARE DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY OBSERVABLE FOR THE ASSET OR LIABILITY. HIERARCHY

LEVEL 3 INPUTS ARE INPUTS THAT ARE NOT OBSERVABLE IN THE MARKET.

INVENTORIES.

CRUDE OIL,

PRODUCTS AND MERCHANDISE INVENTORIES ARE CARRIED AT THE LOWER OF CURRENT MARKET

VALUE OR COST (GENERALLY DETERMINED UNDER THE LAST-IN, FIRST-OUT METHOD –

LIFO). INVENTORY COSTS INCLUDE EXPENDITURES AND OTHER CHARGES (INCLUDING

DEPRECIATION) DIRECTLY AND INDIRECTLY INCURRED IN BRINGING THE INVENTORY TO ITS

EXISTING CONDITION AND LOCATION. SELLING EXPENSES AND GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE

EXPENSES ARE REPORTED AS PERIOD COSTS AND EXCLUDED FROM INVENTORY COST.

INVENTORIES OF MATERIALS AND SUPPLIES ARE VALUED AT COST OR LESS.

PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT.

DEPRECIATION,

DEPLETION AND AMORTIZATION, BASED ON COST LESS ESTIMATED SALVAGE VALUE OF THE

ASSET, ARE PRIMARILY DETERMINED UNDER EITHER THE UNIT-OF-PRODUCTION METHOD OR

THE STRAIGHT-LINE METHOD, WHICH IS BASED ON ESTIMATED ASSET SERVICE LIFE TAKING

OBSOLESCENCE INTO CONSIDERATION. MAINTENANCE AND REPAIRS, INCLUDING PLANNED

MAJOR MAINTENANCE, ARE EXPENSED AS INCURRED. MAJOR RENEWALS AND IMPROVEMENTS

ARE CAPITALIZED AND THE ASSETS REPLACED ARE RETIRED.

THE

CORPORATION USES THE “SUCCESSFUL EFFORTS” METHOD TO ACCOUNT FOR ITS EXPLORATION

AND PRODUCTION ACTIVITIES. UNDER THIS METHOD, COSTS ARE ACCUMULATED ON A

FIELD-BY-FIELD BASIS. COSTS INCURRED TO PURCHASE, LEASE, OR OTHERWISE ACQUIRE A

PROPERTY (WHETHER UNPROVED OR PROVED) ARE CAPITALIZED WHEN INCURRED. EXPLORATORY

WELL COSTS ARE CARRIED AS AN ASSET WHEN THE WELL HAS FOUND A SUFFICIENT QUANTITY

OF RESERVES TO JUSTIFY ITS COMPLETION AS A PRODUCING WELL AND WHERE THE

CORPORATION IS MAKING SUFFICIENT PROGRESS ASSESSING THE RESERVES AND THE

ECONOMIC AND OPERATING VIABILITY OF THE PROJECT. EXPLORATORY WELL COSTS NOT

MEETING THESE CRITERIA ARE CHARGED TO EXPENSE. OTHER EXPLORATORY EXPENDITURES,

INCLUDING GEOPHYSICAL COSTS AND ANNUAL LEASE RENTALS, ARE EXPENSED AS INCURRED.

DEVELOPMENT COSTS, INCLUDING COSTS OF PRODUCTIVE WELLS AND DEVELOPMENT DRY

HOLES, ARE CAPITALIZED.

ACQUISITION COSTS OF PROVED PROPERTIES ARE AMORTIZED USING A

UNIT-OF-PRODUCTION METHOD, COMPUTED ON THE BASIS OF TOTAL PROVED OIL AND GAS

RESERVES.

CAPITALIZED EXPLORATORY

DRILLING AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH PRODUCTIVE DEPLETABLE EXTRACTIVE

PROPERTIES ARE AMORTIZED USING UNIT-OF-PRODUCTION RATES BASED ON THE AMOUNT OF

PROVED DEVELOPED RESERVES OF OIL, GAS AND OTHER MINERALS THAT ARE ESTIMATED TO

BE RECOVERABLE FROM EXISTING FACILITIES USING CURRENT OPERATING METHODS. UNDER

THE UNIT-OF-PRODUCTION METHOD, OIL AND GAS VOLUMES ARE CONSIDERED PRODUCED ONCE

THEY HAVE BEEN MEASURED THROUGH METERS AT CUSTODY TRANSFER OR SALES TRANSACTION

POINTS AT THE OUTLET VALVE ON THE LEASE OR FIELD STORAGE TANK. IN THE EVENT

THAT THE UNIT-OF-PRODUCTION METHOD DOES NOT RESULT IN AN EQUITABLE ALLOCATION

OF COST OVER THE ECONOMIC LIFE OF AN UPSTREAM ASSET, AN ALTERNATIVE SUCH AS THE

STRAIGHT-LINE METHOD IS USED.

PRODUCTION

INVOLVES LIFTING THE OIL AND GAS TO THE SURFACE AND GATHERING, TREATING, FIELD

PROCESSING AND FIELD STORAGE OF THE OIL AND GAS. THE PRODUCTION FUNCTION

NORMALLY TERMINATES AT THE OUTLET VALVE ON THE LEASE OR FIELD PRODUCTION

STORAGE TANK. PRODUCTION COSTS ARE THOSE INCURRED TO OPERATE AND MAINTAIN THE

CORPORATION’S WELLS AND RELATED EQUIPMENT AND FACILITIES AND ARE EXPENSED AS

INCURRED. THEY BECOME PART OF THE COST OF OIL AND GAS PRODUCED. THESE COSTS,

SOMETIMES REFERRED TO AS LIFTING COSTS, INCLUDE SUCH ITEMS AS LABOR COSTS TO

OPERATE THE WELLS AND RELATED EQUIPMENT; REPAIR AND MAINTENANCE COSTS ON THE

WELLS AND EQUIPMENT; MATERIALS, SUPPLIES AND ENERGY COSTS REQUIRED TO OPERATE

THE WELLS AND RELATED EQUIPMENT; AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES RELATED TO THE

PRODUCTION ACTIVITY.

THE

CORPORATION PERFORMS IMPAIRMENT ASSESSMENTS WHENEVER EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES

INDICATE THAT THE CARRYING AMOUNTS OF ITS LONG-LIVED ASSETS (OR GROUP OF

ASSETS) MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE THROUGH FUTURE OPERATIONS OR DISPOSITION. ASSETS

ARE GROUPED AT THE LOWEST LEVEL FOR WHICH THERE ARE IDENTIFIABLE CASH FLOWS

THAT ARE LARGELY INDEPENDENT OF THE CASH FLOWS OF OTHER GROUPS OF ASSETS FOR

THIS ASSESSMENT.

POTENTIAL

TRIGGER EVENTS FOR IMPAIRMENT EVALUATION INCLUDE.

·

A SIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN THE

MARKET PRICE OF A LONG-LIVED ASSET;

·

A SIGNIFICANT ADVERSE CHANGE IN

THE EXTENT OR MANNER IN WHICH AN ASSET IS BEING USED OR IN ITS PHYSICAL

CONDITION INCLUDING A SIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN CURRENT AND PROJECTED RESERVE

VOLUMES;

·

A SIGNIFICANT ADVERSE CHANGE IN

LEGAL FACTORS OR IN THE BUSINESS CLIMATE THAT COULD AFFECT THE VALUE, INCLUDING

AN ADVERSE ACTION OR ASSESSMENT BY A REGULATOR;

·

AN ACCUMULATION OF PROJECT COSTS

SIGNIFICANTLY IN EXCESS OF THE AMOUNT ORIGINALLY EXPECTED;

·

A CURRENT-PERIOD OPERATING LOSS

COMBINED WITH A HISTORY AND FORECAST OF OPERATING OR CASH FLOW LOSSES; AND

·

A CURRENT EXPECTATION THAT, MORE

LIKELY THAN NOT, A LONG-LIVED ASSET WILL BE SOLD OR OTHERWISE DISPOSED OF

SIGNIFICANTLY BEFORE THE END OF ITS PREVIOUSLY ESTIMATED USEFUL LIFE.

THE

CORPORATION PERFORMS ASSET VALUATION ANALYSES ON AN ONGOING BASIS AS A PART OF

ITS ASSET MANAGEMENT PROGRAM. THESE ANALYSES AND OTHER PROFITABILITY REVIEWS

ASSIST THE CORPORATION IN ASSESSING WHETHER THE CARRYING AMOUNTS OF ANY OF ITS

ASSETS MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE.

IN

GENERAL, THE CORPORATION DOES NOT VIEW TEMPORARILY LOW PRICES OR MARGINS AS A

TRIGGER EVENT FOR CONDUCTING IMPAIRMENT TESTS. THE MARKETS FOR CRUDE OIL,

NATURAL GAS AND PETROLEUM PRODUCTS, HAVE A HISTORY OF SIGNIFICANT PRICE

VOLATILITY. ALTHOUGH PRICES WILL OCCASIONALLY DROP SIGNIFICANTLY, INDUSTRY

PRICES OVER THE LONG TERM WILL CONTINUE TO BE DRIVEN BY MARKET SUPPLY AND

DEMAND.

69

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

ON THE SUPPLY SIDE, INDUSTRY PRODUCTION FROM MATURE

FIELDS IS DECLINING, BUT THIS IS BEING OFFSET BY PRODUCTION FROM NEW

DISCOVERIES AND FIELD DEVELOPMENTS. OPEC PRODUCTION POLICIES ALSO HAVE AN

IMPACT ON WORLD OIL SUPPLIES. THE DEMAND SIDE IS LARGELY A FUNCTION OF GLOBAL

ECONOMIC GROWTH. THE RELATIVE GROWTH/DECLINE IN SUPPLY VERSUS DEMAND WILL

DETERMINE INDUSTRY PRICES OVER THE LONG TERM, AND THESE CANNOT BE ACCURATELY

PREDICTED.

IF

THERE WERE A TRIGGER EVENT, THE CORPORATION ESTIMATES THE FUTURE UNDISCOUNTED

CASH FLOWS OF THE AFFECTED PROPERTIES TO JUDGE THE RECOVERABILITY OF CARRYING

AMOUNTS. CASH FLOWS USED IN IMPAIRMENT EVALUATIONS ARE DEVELOPED USING

ESTIMATES FOR FUTURE CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS COMMODITY PRICES, REFINING AND

CHEMICAL MARGINS, AND FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES. VOLUMES ARE BASED ON

PROJECTED FIELD AND FACILITY PRODUCTION PROFILES, THROUGHPUT, OR SALES. THESE

EVALUATIONS MAKE USE OF THE CORPORATION’S PRICE, MARGIN, VOLUME, AND COST

ASSUMPTIONS DEVELOPED IN THE ANNUAL PLANNING AND BUDGETING PROCESS, AND ARE

CONSISTENT WITH THE CRITERIA MANAGEMENT USES TO EVALUATE INVESTMENT

OPPORTUNITIES. WHERE UNPROVED RESERVES EXIST, AN APPROPRIATELY RISK-ADJUSTED

AMOUNT OF THESE RESERVES MAY BE INCLUDED IN THE EVALUATION.

AN

ASSET GROUP WOULD BE IMPAIRED IF ITS UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS WERE LESS THAN THE

ASSET’S CARRYING VALUE. IMPAIRMENTS ARE MEASURED BY THE AMOUNT BY WHICH THE

CARRYING VALUE EXCEEDS FAIR VALUE. CASH FLOW ESTIMATES FOR IMPAIRMENT TESTING

EXCLUDE THE EFFECTS OF DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS.

SIGNIFICANT

UNPROVED PROPERTIES ARE ASSESSED FOR IMPAIRMENT INDIVIDUALLY, AND VALUATION

ALLOWANCES AGAINST THE CAPITALIZED COSTS ARE RECORDED BASED ON THE ESTIMATED

ECONOMIC CHANCE OF SUCCESS AND THE LENGTH OF TIME THAT THE CORPORATION EXPECTS

TO HOLD THE PROPERTIES. PROPERTIES THAT ARE NOT INDIVIDUALLY SIGNIFICANT ARE

AGGREGATED BY GROUPS AND AMORTIZED BASED ON DEVELOPMENT RISK AND AVERAGE

HOLDING PERIOD.

GAINS

ON SALES OF PROVED AND UNPROVED PROPERTIES ARE ONLY RECOGNIZED WHEN THERE IS NEITHER

UNCERTAINTY ABOUT THE RECOVERY OF COSTS APPLICABLE TO ANY INTEREST RETAINED NOR

ANY SUBSTANTIAL OBLIGATION FOR FUTURE PERFORMANCE BY THE CORPORATION.

LOSSES

ON PROPERTIES SOLD ARE RECOGNIZED WHEN INCURRED OR WHEN THE PROPERTIES ARE HELD

FOR SALE AND THE FAIR VALUE OF THE PROPERTIES IS LESS THAN THE CARRYING VALUE.

INTEREST

COSTS INCURRED TO FINANCE EXPENDITURES DURING THE CONSTRUCTION PHASE OF

MULTIYEAR PROJECTS ARE CAPITALIZED AS PART OF THE HISTORICAL COST OF ACQUIRING

THE CONSTRUCTED ASSETS. THE PROJECT CONSTRUCTION PHASE COMMENCES WITH THE

DEVELOPMENT OF THE DETAILED ENGINEERING DESIGN AND ENDS WHEN THE CONSTRUCTED

ASSETS ARE READY FOR THEIR INTENDED USE. CAPITALIZED INTEREST COSTS ARE

INCLUDED IN PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT AND ARE DEPRECIATED OVER THE SERVICE

LIFE OF THE RELATED ASSETS.

ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS AND ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES.

THE CORPORATION INCURS RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS FOR

CERTAIN ASSETS. THE FAIR VALUES OF THESE OBLIGATIONS ARE RECORDED AS

LIABILITIES ON A DISCOUNTED BASIS, WHICH IS TYPICALLY AT THE TIME THE ASSETS

ARE INSTALLED. THE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THESE LIABILITIES ARE CAPITALIZED AS

PART OF THE RELATED ASSETS AND DEPRECIATED. OVER TIME, THE LIABILITIES ARE

ACCRETED FOR THE CHANGE IN THEIR PRESENT VALUE.

LIABILITIES

FOR ENVIRONMENTAL COSTS ARE RECORDED WHEN IT IS PROBABLE THAT OBLIGATIONS HAVE

BEEN INCURRED AND THE AMOUNTS CAN BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED. THESE LIABILITIES

ARE NOT REDUCED BY POSSIBLE RECOVERIES FROM THIRD PARTIES AND PROJECTED CASH

EXPENDITURES ARE NOT DISCOUNTED.

FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION.

THE

CORPORATION SELECTS THE FUNCTIONAL REPORTING CURRENCY FOR ITS INTERNATIONAL

SUBSIDIARIES BASED ON THE CURRENCY OF THE PRIMARY ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH

EACH SUBSIDIARY OPERATES.

DOWNSTREAM

AND CHEMICAL OPERATIONS PRIMARILY USE THE LOCAL CURRENCY. HOWEVER, THE U.S.

DOLLAR IS USED IN COUNTRIES WITH A HISTORY OF HIGH INFLATION (PRIMARILY IN

LATIN AMERICA) AND SINGAPORE, WHICH PREDOMINANTLY SELLS INTO THE U.S. DOLLAR

EXPORT MARKET. UPSTREAM OPERATIONS WHICH ARE RELATIVELY SELF-CONTAINED AND

INTEGRATED WITHIN A PARTICULAR COUNTRY, SUCH AS CANADA, THE UNITED KINGDOM,

NORWAY AND CONTINENTAL EUROPE, USE THE LOCAL CURRENCY. SOME UPSTREAM

OPERATIONS, PRIMARILY IN ASIA AND AFRICA, USE THE U.S. DOLLAR BECAUSE THEY

PREDOMINANTLY SELL CRUDE AND NATURAL GAS PRODUCTION INTO U.S.

DOLLAR-DENOMINATED MARKETS.

FOR

ALL OPERATIONS, GAINS OR LOSSES FROM REMEASURING FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSACTIONS

INTO THE FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY ARE INCLUDED IN INCOME.

STOCK-BASED PAYMENTS.

THE CORPORATION

AWARDS STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION TO EMPLOYEES IN THE FORM OF RESTRICTED STOCK

AND RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS. COMPENSATION EXPENSE IS MEASURED BY THE PRICE OF

THE STOCK AT THE DATE OF GRANT AND IS RECOGNIZED IN INCOME OVER THE REQUISITE

SERVICE PERIOD.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

2. ACCOUNTING CHANGES

THE

CORPORATION DID NOT ADOPT AUTHORITATIVE GUIDANCE IN 2015 THAT HAD A MATERIAL

IMPACT ON THE CORPORATION’S FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

IN

MAY 2014, THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD ISSUED A NEW STANDARD,

REVENUE

FROM CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS

. THE STANDARD ESTABLISHES A SINGLE REVENUE

RECOGNITION MODEL FOR ALL CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS, ELIMINATES INDUSTRY

SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS, AND EXPANDS DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS. THE STANDARD IS

REQUIRED TO BE ADOPTED BEGINNING JANUARY 1, 2018.

“SALES

AND OTHER OPERATING REVENUE” ON THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF INCOME INCLUDES

SALES, EXCISE AND VALUE-ADDED TAXES ON SALES TRANSACTIONS. WHEN THE CORPORATION

ADOPTS THE STANDARD, REVENUE WILL EXCLUDE SALES-BASED TAXES COLLECTED ON BEHALF

OF THIRD PARTIES. THIS CHANGE IN REPORTING WILL NOT IMPACT EARNINGS.

THE

CORPORATION CONTINUES TO EVALUATE OTHER AREAS OF THE STANDARD AND ITS EFFECT ON

THE CORPORATION’S FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

7. EQUITY COMPANY INFORMATION

THE

SUMMARIZED FINANCIAL INFORMATION BELOW INCLUDES AMOUNTS RELATED TO CERTAIN

LESS-THAN-MAJORITY-OWNED COMPANIES AND MAJORITY-OWNED SUBSIDIARIES WHERE

MINORITY SHAREHOLDERS POSSESS THE RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN SIGNIFICANT

MANAGEMENT DECISIONS (SEE NOTE 1). THESE COMPANIES ARE PRIMARILY ENGAGED IN OIL

AND GAS EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION, AND NATURAL GAS MARKETING IN NORTH AMERICA;

NATURAL GAS EXPLORATION, PRODUCTION AND DISTRIBUTION, AND DOWNSTREAM OPERATIONS

IN EUROPE; AND EXPLORATION, PRODUCTION, LIQUEFIED NATURAL GAS (LNG) OPERATIONS,

REFINING OPERATIONS, PETROCHEMICAL MANUFACTURING, AND FUEL SALES IN ASIA. ALSO

INCLUDED ARE SEVERAL REFINING, PETROCHEMICAL MANUFACTURING, AND MARKETING

VENTURES.

THE CORPORATION’S

OWNERSHIP IN THESE VENTURES IS IN THE FORM OF SHARES IN CORPORATE JOINT

VENTURES AS WELL AS INTERESTS IN PARTNERSHIPS. DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE

COMPANY’S CARRYING VALUE OF AN EQUITY INVESTMENT AND ITS UNDERLYING EQUITY IN

THE NET ASSETS OF THE AFFILIATE ARE ASSIGNED TO THE EXTENT PRACTICABLE TO

SPECIFIC ASSETS AND LIABILITIES BASED ON THE COMPANY’S ANALYSIS OF THE FACTORS

GIVING RISE TO THE DIFFERENCE. THE AMORTIZATION OF THIS DIFFERENCE, AS

APPROPRIATE, IS INCLUDED IN “INCOME FROM EQUITY AFFILIATES.”

THE

SHARE OF TOTAL EQUITY COMPANY REVENUES FROM SALES TO EXXONMOBIL

CONSOLIDATED COMPANIES WAS 15 PERCENT, 14 PERCENT AND 13 PERCENT IN THE YEARS

2015, 2014 AND 2013, RESPECTIVELY.

IN

2013 AND 2014, THE CORPORATION AND ROSNEFT ESTABLISHED VARIOUS ENTITIES TO

CONDUCT EXPLORATION AND RESEARCH ACTIVITIES. PERIODS OF DISPROPORTIONATE

FUNDING WILL RESULT IN THE CORPORATION RECOGNIZING, DURING THE EARLY PHASES OF

THE PROJECTS, AN INVESTMENT THAT IS LARGER THAN ITS EQUITY SHARE IN THESE

ENTITIES. THESE JOINT VENTURES ARE CONSIDERED VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES. HOWEVER,

SINCE THE CORPORATION IS NOT THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY OF THESE ENTITIES, THE

JOINT VENTURES ARE REPORTED AS EQUITY COMPANIES. IN 2014, THE EUROPEAN UNION

AND UNITED STATES IMPOSED SANCTIONS RELATING TO THE RUSSIAN ENERGY SECTOR. WITH

RESPECT TO THE FOREGOING, EACH JOINT VENTURE CONTINUES TO COMPLY WITH ALL APPLICABLE

LAWS, RULES AND REGULATIONS. THE CORPORATION'S MAXIMUM BEFORE-TAX EXPOSURE TO

LOSS FROM THESE JOINT VENTURES AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2015, IS $1.0 BILLION.

ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS

THE

CORPORATION INCURS RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS FOR CERTAIN ASSETS. THE FAIR VALUES

OF THESE OBLIGATIONS ARE RECORDED AS LIABILITIES ON A DISCOUNTED BASIS, WHICH

IS TYPICALLY AT THE TIME THE ASSETS ARE INSTALLED. IN THE ESTIMATION OF FAIR

VALUE, THE CORPORATION USES ASSUMPTIONS AND JUDGMENTS REGARDING SUCH FACTORS AS

THE EXISTENCE OF A LEGAL OBLIGATION FOR AN ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATION;

TECHNICAL ASSESSMENTS OF THE ASSETS; ESTIMATED AMOUNTS AND TIMING OF SETTLEMENTS;

DISCOUNT RATES; AND INFLATION RATES. ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS INCURRED IN

THE CURRENT PERIOD WERE LEVEL 3 FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS. THE COSTS ASSOCIATED

WITH THESE LIABILITIES ARE CAPITALIZED AS PART OF THE RELATED ASSETS AND

DEPRECIATED AS THE RESERVES ARE PRODUCED. OVER TIME, THE LIABILITIES ARE

ACCRETED FOR THE CHANGE IN THEIR PRESENT VALUE.

ASSET

RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS FOR DOWNSTREAM AND CHEMICAL FACILITIES GENERALLY BECOME

FIRM AT THE TIME THE FACILITIES ARE PERMANENTLY SHUT DOWN AND DISMANTLED. THESE

OBLIGATIONS MAY INCLUDE THE COSTS OF ASSET DISPOSAL AND ADDITIONAL SOIL

REMEDIATION. HOWEVER, THESE SITES HAVE INDETERMINATE LIVES BASED ON PLANS FOR

CONTINUED OPERATIONS AND AS SUCH, THE FAIR VALUE OF THE CONDITIONAL LEGAL

OBLIGATIONS CANNOT BE MEASURED, SINCE IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO ESTIMATE THE FUTURE

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

13. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND DERIVATIVES

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS.

THE FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

IS DETERMINED BY REFERENCE TO OBSERVABLE MARKET DATA AND OTHER VALUATION

TECHNIQUES AS APPROPRIATE. THE ONLY CATEGORY OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WHERE THE

DIFFERENCE BETWEEN FAIR VALUE AND RECORDED BOOK VALUE IS NOTABLE IS LONG-TERM

DEBT. THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF TOTAL LONG-TERM DEBT, EXCLUDING CAPITALIZED

LEASE OBLIGATIONS, WAS $18.9 BILLION AND $11.7 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2015,

AND 2014, RESPECTIVELY, AS COMPARED TO RECORDED BOOK VALUES OF $18.7 BILLION

AND $11.3 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2015, AND 2014, RESPECTIVELY. THE INCREASE IN

THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE AND BOOK VALUE OF LONG-TERM DEBT REFLECTS THE CORPORATION’S

ISSUANCE OF $8.0 BILLION OF LONG-TERM DEBT IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2015.

THE FAIR VALUE OF LONG-TERM DEBT BY

HIERARCHY LEVEL AT DECEMBER 31, 2015, IS: LEVEL 1 $18,584 MILLION; LEVEL 2 $208

MILLION; AND LEVEL 3 $62 MILLION.

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS.

THE CORPORATION’S SIZE, STRONG CAPITAL

STRUCTURE, GEOGRAPHIC DIVERSITY AND THE COMPLEMENTARY NATURE OF THE UPSTREAM,

DOWNSTREAM AND CHEMICAL BUSINESSES REDUCE THE CORPORATION’S ENTERPRISE-WIDE

RISK FROM CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES, CURRENCY RATES AND COMMODITY PRICES. AS A

RESULT, THE CORPORATION MAKES LIMITED USE OF DERIVATIVES TO MITIGATE THE IMPACT

OF SUCH CHANGES. THE CORPORATION DOES NOT ENGAGE IN SPECULATIVE DERIVATIVE

ACTIVITIES OR DERIVATIVE TRADING ACTIVITIES NOR DOES IT USE DERIVATIVES WITH

LEVERAGED FEATURES. WHEN THE CORPORATION DOES ENTER INTO DERIVATIVE

TRANSACTIONS, IT IS TO OFFSET EXPOSURES ASSOCIATED WITH INTEREST RATES, FOREIGN

CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES AND HYDROCARBON PRICES THAT ARISE FROM EXISTING ASSETS,

LIABILITIES AND FORECASTED TRANSACTIONS.

THE

ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS OUTSTANDING AND RECORDED ON THE

BALANCE SHEET WAS A NET ASSET OF $21 MILLION AT YEAR-END 2015 AND A NET ASSET

OF $75 MILLION AT YEAR-END 2014. ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ASSOCIATED WITH

DERIVATIVES ARE USUALLY RECORDED EITHER IN “OTHER CURRENT ASSETS” OR “ACCOUNTS

PAYABLE AND ACCRUED LIABILITIES.”

THE

CORPORATION’S FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT OF ITS DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS USE EITHER

LEVEL 1 OR LEVEL 2 INPUTS.

THE

CORPORATION RECOGNIZED A BEFORE-TAX GAIN OR (LOSS) RELATED TO DERIVATIVE

INSTRUMENTS OF $39 MILLION, $110 MILLION AND $(7) MILLION DURING 2015, 2014

AND 2013, RESPECTIVELY. INCOME STATEMENT EFFECTS ASSOCIATED WITH DERIVATIVES ARE

USUALLY RECORDED EITHER IN “SALES AND OTHER OPERATING REVENUE” OR “CRUDE OIL

AND PRODUCT PURCHASES.”

THE

CORPORATION BELIEVES THERE ARE NO MATERIAL MARKET OR CREDIT RISKS TO THE

CORPORATION’S FINANCIAL POSITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR LIQUIDITY AS A

RESULT OF THE DERIVATIVE ACTIVITIES DESCRIBED ABOVE.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

14. LONG-TERM DEBT

AT

DECEMBER 31, 2015, LONG-TERM DEBT CONSISTED OF $19,217 MILLION DUE

IN U.S. DOLLARS AND $708 MILLION REPRESENTING THE U.S. DOLLAR EQUIVALENT

AT YEAR-END EXCHANGE RATES OF AMOUNTS PAYABLE IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES. THESE

AMOUNTS EXCLUDE THAT PORTION OF LONG-TERM DEBT, TOTALING $558 MILLION, WHICH

MATURES WITHIN ONE YEAR AND IS INCLUDED IN CURRENT LIABILITIES. THE INCREASE IN

THE BOOK VALUE OF LONG-TERM DEBT REFLECTS THE CORPORATION’S ISSUANCE OF $8.0

BILLION OF LONG-TERM DEBT IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2015. THE AMOUNTS OF

LONG-TERM DEBT, INCLUDING CAPITALIZED LEASE OBLIGATIONS, MATURING IN EACH OF

THE FOUR YEARS AFTER DECEMBER 31, 2016, IN MILLIONS OF DOLLARS, ARE: 2017

– $2,959; 2018 – $2,967; 2019 – $2,374; AND 2020 – $1,602.

AT DECEMBER 31, 2015, THE CORPORATION’S UNUSED LONG-TERM CREDIT LINES WERE $0.4

BILLION.

15. INCENTIVE PROGRAM

THE 2003 INCENTIVE PROGRAM PROVIDES FOR GRANTS OF STOCK

OPTIONS, STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS (SARS), RESTRICTED STOCK AND OTHER FORMS OF

AWARD. AWARDS MAY BE GRANTED TO ELIGIBLE EMPLOYEES OF THE CORPORATION AND THOSE

AFFILIATES AT LEAST 50 PERCENT OWNED. OUTSTANDING AWARDS ARE SUBJECT TO CERTAIN

FORFEITURE PROVISIONS CONTAINED IN THE PROGRAM OR AWARD INSTRUMENT. OPTIONS AND

SARS MAY BE GRANTED AT PRICES NOT LESS THAN 100 PERCENT OF MARKET VALUE ON THE

DATE OF GRANT AND HAVE A MAXIMUM LIFE OF 10 YEARS. THE MAXIMUM NUMBER OF SHARES

OF STOCK THAT MAY BE ISSUED UNDER THE 2003 INCENTIVE PROGRAM IS 220 MILLION.

AWARDS THAT ARE FORFEITED, EXPIRE OR ARE SETTLED IN CASH, DO NOT COUNT AGAINST

THIS MAXIMUM LIMIT. THE 2003 INCENTIVE PROGRAM DOES NOT HAVE A SPECIFIED TERM.

NEW AWARDS MAY BE MADE UNTIL THE AVAILABLE SHARES ARE DEPLETED, UNLESS THE

BOARD TERMINATES THE PLAN EARLY. AT THE END OF 2015, REMAINING SHARES AVAILABLE

FOR AWARD UNDER THE 2003 INCENTIVE PROGRAM WERE 100

MILLION.

RESTRICTED

STOCK AND RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS.

AWARDS TOTALING 9,681 THOUSAND, 9,775 THOUSAND, AND 9,729 THOUSAND

OF RESTRICTED (NONVESTED) COMMON STOCK UNITS WERE GRANTED IN 2015, 2014 AND 2013,

RESPECTIVELY. COMPENSATION EXPENSE FOR THESE AWARDS IS BASED ON THE PRICE OF

THE STOCK AT THE DATE OF GRANT AND IS RECOGNIZED IN INCOME OVER THE REQUISITE

SERVICE PERIOD. SHARES FOR THESE AWARDS ARE ISSUED TO EMPLOYEES FROM TREASURY

STOCK. THE UNITS THAT ARE SETTLED IN CASH ARE RECORDED AS LIABILITIES AND THEIR

CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE ARE RECOGNIZED OVER THE VESTING PERIOD. DURING THE

APPLICABLE RESTRICTED PERIODS, THE SHARES AND UNITS MAY NOT BE SOLD OR TRANSFERRED

AND ARE SUBJECT TO FORFEITURE. THE MAJORITY OF THE AWARDS HAVE GRADED VESTING

PERIODS, WITH 50 PERCENT OF THE SHARES AND UNITS IN EACH AWARD VESTING AFTER

THREE YEARS AND THE REMAINING 50 PERCENT VESTING AFTER SEVEN YEARS. AWARDS

GRANTED TO A SMALL NUMBER OF SENIOR EXECUTIVES HAVE VESTING PERIODS OF FIVE

YEARS FOR 50 PERCENT OF THE AWARD AND OF 10 YEARS OR RETIREMENT, WHICHEVER

OCCURS LATER, FOR THE REMAINING 50 PERCENT OF THE AWARD.

THE

CORPORATION HAS PURCHASED SHARES IN THE OPEN MARKET AND THROUGH NEGOTIATED

TRANSACTIONS TO OFFSET SHARES ISSUED IN CONJUNCTION WITH BENEFIT PLANS AND

PROGRAMS. PURCHASES MAY BE DISCONTINUED AT ANY TIME WITHOUT PRIOR NOTICE.

16. LITIGATION AND OTHER CONTINGENCIES

LITIGATION.

A VARIETY OF CLAIMS HAVE

BEEN MADE AGAINST EXXONMOBIL AND CERTAIN OF ITS CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES IN A

NUMBER OF PENDING LAWSUITS. MANAGEMENT HAS REGULAR LITIGATION REVIEWS,

INCLUDING UPDATES FROM CORPORATE AND OUTSIDE COUNSEL, TO ASSESS THE NEED FOR ACCOUNTING

RECOGNITION OR DISCLOSURE OF THESE CONTINGENCIES. THE CORPORATION ACCRUES AN

UNDISCOUNTED LIABILITY FOR THOSE CONTINGENCIES WHERE THE INCURRENCE OF A LOSS

IS PROBABLE AND THE AMOUNT CAN BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED. IF A RANGE OF AMOUNTS

CAN BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED AND NO AMOUNT WITHIN THE RANGE IS A BETTER ESTIMATE

THAN ANY OTHER AMOUNT, THEN THE MINIMUM OF THE RANGE IS ACCRUED. THE

CORPORATION DOES NOT RECORD LIABILITIES WHEN THE LIKELIHOOD THAT THE LIABILITY

HAS BEEN INCURRED IS PROBABLE BUT THE AMOUNT CANNOT BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED OR

WHEN THE LIABILITY IS BELIEVED TO BE ONLY REASONABLY POSSIBLE OR REMOTE. FOR

CONTINGENCIES WHERE AN UNFAVORABLE OUTCOME IS REASONABLY POSSIBLE AND WHICH ARE

SIGNIFICANT, THE CORPORATION DISCLOSES THE NATURE OF THE CONTINGENCY AND, WHERE

FEASIBLE, AN ESTIMATE OF THE POSSIBLE LOSS. FOR PURPOSES OF OUR CONTINGENCY

DISCLOSURES, “SIGNIFICANT” INCLUDES MATERIAL MATTERS AS WELL AS OTHER MATTERS

WHICH MANAGEMENT BELIEVES SHOULD BE DISCLOSED. EXXONMOBIL WILL CONTINUE TO

DEFEND ITSELF VIGOROUSLY IN THESE MATTERS. BASED ON A CONSIDERATION OF ALL

RELEVANT FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES, THE CORPORATION DOES NOT BELIEVE THE ULTIMATE

OUTCOME OF ANY CURRENTLY PENDING LAWSUIT AGAINST EXXONMOBIL WILL HAVE A

MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT UPON THE CORPORATION’S OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL CONDITION,

OR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS TAKEN AS A WHOLE.

OTHER

CONTINGENCIES.

THE

CORPORATION AND CERTAIN OF ITS CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES WERE CONTINGENTLY

LIABLE AT DECEMBER 31, 2015, FOR GUARANTEES RELATING TO NOTES, LOANS

AND PERFORMANCE UNDER CONTRACTS. WHERE GUARANTEES FOR ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION

AND OTHER SIMILAR MATTERS DO NOT INCLUDE A STATED CAP, THE AMOUNTS REFLECT

MANAGEMENT’S ESTIMATE OF THE MAXIMUM POTENTIAL EXPOSURE.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

IN ACCORDANCE

WITH A NATIONALIZATION DECREE ISSUED BY VENEZUELA’S PRESIDENT IN FEBRUARY 2007,

BY MAY 1, 2007, A SUBSIDIARY OF THE VENEZUELAN NATIONAL OIL COMPANY (PDVSA)

ASSUMED THE OPERATORSHIP OF THE CERRO NEGRO HEAVY OIL PROJECT. THIS PROJECT HAD

BEEN OPERATED AND OWNED BY EXXONMOBIL AFFILIATES HOLDING A 41.67 PERCENT

OWNERSHIP INTEREST IN THE PROJECT. THE DECREE ALSO REQUIRED CONVERSION OF THE

CERRO NEGRO PROJECT INTO A “MIXED ENTERPRISE” AND AN INCREASE IN PDVSA’S OR ONE

OF ITS AFFILIATE’S OWNERSHIP INTEREST IN THE PROJECT, WITH THE STIPULATION THAT

IF EXXONMOBIL REFUSED TO ACCEPT THE TERMS FOR THE FORMATION OF THE MIXED

ENTERPRISE WITHIN A SPECIFIED PERIOD OF TIME, THE GOVERNMENT WOULD “DIRECTLY

ASSUME THE ACTIVITIES” CARRIED OUT BY THE JOINT VENTURE. EXXONMOBIL REFUSED TO

ACCEDE TO THE TERMS PROFFERED BY THE GOVERNMENT, AND ON JUNE 27, 2007, THE

GOVERNMENT EXPROPRIATED EXXONMOBIL’S 41.67 PERCENT INTEREST IN THE CERRO NEGRO

PROJECT.

ON SEPTEMBER 6, 2007, AFFILIATES OF

EXXONMOBIL FILED A REQUEST FOR ARBITRATION WITH THE INTERNATIONAL CENTRE FOR

SETTLEMENT OF INVESTMENT DISPUTES (ICSID). THE ICSID TRIBUNAL ISSUED A DECISION

ON JUNE 10, 2010, FINDING THAT IT HAD JURISDICTION TO PROCEED ON THE BASIS OF

THE NETHERLANDS-VENEZUELA BILATERAL INVESTMENT TREATY. ON OCTOBER 9, 2014, THE

ICSID TRIBUNAL ISSUED ITS FINAL AWARD FINDING IN FAVOR OF THE EXXONMOBIL AFFILIATES

AND AWARDING $1.6 BILLION AS OF THE DATE OF EXPROPRIATION, JUNE 27, 2007, AND

INTEREST FROM THAT DATE AT 3.25% COMPOUNDED ANNUALLY UNTIL THE DATE OF PAYMENT

IN FULL. THE TRIBUNAL ALSO NOTED THAT ONE OF THE CERRO NEGRO PROJECT AGREEMENTS

PROVIDES A MECHANISM TO PREVENT DOUBLE RECOVERY BETWEEN THE ICSID AWARD AND ALL

OR PART OF AN EARLIER AWARD OF $908 MILLION TO AN EXXONMOBIL AFFILIATE, MOBIL

CERRO NEGRO, LTD., AGAINST PDVSA AND A PDVSA AFFILIATE, PDVSA CN, IN AN

ARBITRATION UNDER THE RULES OF THE INTERNATIONAL CHAMBER OF COMMERCE.

ON

JUNE 12, 2015, THE TRIBUNAL REJECTED IN ITS ENTIRETY VENEZUELA’S OCTOBER 23,

2014, APPLICATION TO REVISE THE ICSID AWARD. THE TRIBUNAL ALSO LIFTED THE

ASSOCIATED STAY OF ENFORCEMENT THAT HAD BEEN ENTERED UPON THE FILING OF THE

APPLICATION TO REVISE.

STILL

PENDING IS VENEZUELA’S FEBRUARY 2, 2015, APPLICATION TO ICSID SEEKING ANNULMENT

OF THE ICSID AWARD. THAT APPLICATION ALLEGES THAT, IN ISSUING THE ICSID AWARD,

THE TRIBUNAL EXCEEDED ITS POWERS, FAILED TO STATE REASONS ON WHICH THE ICSID

AWARD WAS BASED, AND DEPARTED FROM A FUNDAMENTAL RULE OF PROCEDURE. A SEPARATE

STAY OF THE ICSID AWARD WAS ENTERED FOLLOWING THE FILING OF THE ANNULMENT

APPLICATION. ON JULY 7, 2015, THE ICSID COMMITTEE CONSIDERING THE ANNULMENT

APPLICATION HEARD ARGUMENTS FROM THE PARTIES ON WHETHER TO LIFT THE STAY OF THE

AWARD ASSOCIATED WITH THAT APPLICATION. ON JULY 28, 2015, THE COMMITTEE ISSUED

AN ORDER THAT WOULD LIFT THE STAY OF ENFORCEMENT UNLESS, WITHIN 30 DAYS,

VENEZUELA DELIVERED A COMMITMENT TO PAY THE AWARD IF THE APPLICATION TO ANNUL

IS DENIED. ON SEPTEMBER 17, 2015, THE COMMITTEE RULED THAT VENEZUELA HAD

COMPLIED WITH THE REQUIREMENT TO SUBMIT A WRITTEN COMMITMENT TO PAY THE AWARD

AND SO LEFT THE STAY OF ENFORCEMENT IN PLACE. A HEARING ON VENEZUELA’S APPLICATION

FOR ANNULMENT, PREVIOUSLY SCHEDULED FOR JANUARY 25-27, 2016, HAS BEEN

RESCHEDULED FOR MARCH 8-9, 2016.

THE

UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK ENTERED

JUDGMENT ON THE ICSID AWARD ON OCTOBER 10, 2014. MOTIONS FILED BY VENEZUELA TO

VACATE THAT JUDGMENT ON PROCEDURAL GROUNDS AND TO MODIFY THE JUDGMENT BY

REDUCING THE RATE OF INTEREST TO BE PAID ON THE ICSID AWARD FROM THE ENTRY OF

THE COURT’S JUDGMENT, UNTIL THE DATE OF PAYMENT, WERE DENIED ON FEBRUARY 13,

2015, AND MARCH 4, 2015, RESPECTIVELY. ON MARCH 9, 2015, VENEZUELA FILED A

NOTICE OF APPEAL OF THE COURT’S ACTIONS ON THE TWO MOTIONS. ORAL ARGUMENTS ON

THIS APPEAL WERE HELD BEFORE THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE SECOND

CIRCUIT ON JANUARY 7, 2016.

THE

DISTRICT COURT’S JUDGMENT ON THE ICSID AWARD IS CURRENTLY STAYED UNTIL SUCH

TIME AS ICSID’S STAY OF THE AWARD ENTERED FOLLOWING VENEZUELA’S FILING OF ITS

APPLICATION TO ANNUL HAS BEEN LIFTED. THE NET IMPACT OF THESE MATTERS ON THE

CORPORATION’S CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL RESULTS CANNOT BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED.

REGARDLESS, THE CORPORATION DOES NOT EXPECT THE RESOLUTION TO HAVE A MATERIAL

EFFECT UPON THE CORPORATION’S OPERATIONS OR FINANCIAL CONDITION.

AN

AFFILIATE OF EXXONMOBIL IS ONE OF THE CONTRACTORS UNDER A PRODUCTION SHARING

CONTRACT (PSC) WITH THE NIGERIAN NATIONAL PETROLEUM CORPORATION (NNPC) COVERING

THE ERHA BLOCK LOCATED IN THE OFFSHORE WATERS OF NIGERIA. EXXONMOBIL'S

AFFILIATE IS THE OPERATOR OF THE BLOCK AND OWNS A 56.25 PERCENT INTEREST UNDER

THE PSC. THE CONTRACTORS ARE IN DISPUTE WITH NNPC REGARDING NNPC'S LIFTING OF

CRUDE OIL IN EXCESS OF ITS ENTITLEMENT UNDER THE TERMS OF THE PSC. IN

ACCORDANCE WITH THE TERMS OF THE PSC, THE CONTRACTORS INITIATED ARBITRATION IN

ABUJA, NIGERIA, UNDER THE NIGERIAN ARBITRATION AND CONCILIATION ACT. ON OCTOBER

24, 2011, A THREE-MEMBER ARBITRAL TRIBUNAL ISSUED AN AWARD UPHOLDING THE CONTRACTORS'

POSITION IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS AND AWARDING DAMAGES TO THE CONTRACTORS

JOINTLY IN AN AMOUNT OF APPROXIMATELY $1.8 BILLION PLUS $234 MILLION IN ACCRUED

INTEREST. THE CONTRACTORS PETITIONED A NIGERIAN FEDERAL COURT FOR ENFORCEMENT

OF THE AWARD, AND NNPC PETITIONED THE SAME COURT TO HAVE THE AWARD SET ASIDE.

ON MAY 22, 2012, THE COURT SET ASIDE THE AWARD. THE CONTRACTORS APPEALED THAT

JUDGMENT TO THE COURT OF APPEAL, ABUJA JUDICIAL DIVISION. IN JUNE 2013, THE

CONTRACTORS FILED A LAWSUIT AGAINST NNPC IN THE NIGERIAN FEDERAL HIGH COURT IN

ORDER TO PRESERVE THEIR ABILITY TO SEEK ENFORCEMENT OF THE PSC IN THE COURTS IF

NECESSARY. IN OCTOBER 2014, THE CONTRACTORS FILED SUIT IN THE UNITED STATES

DISTRICT COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK TO ENFORCE, IF NECESSARY,

THE ARBITRATION AWARD AGAINST NNPC ASSETS RESIDING WITHIN THAT JURISDICTION.

NNPC HAS MOVED TO DISMISS THE LAWSUIT. PROCEEDINGS IN THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF

NEW YORK ARE CURRENTLY STAYED. AT THIS TIME, THE NET IMPACT OF THIS MATTER ON

THE CORPORATION'S CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL RESULTS CANNOT BE REASONABLY

ESTIMATED. HOWEVER, REGARDLESS OF THE OUTCOME OF ENFORCEMENT PROCEEDINGS, THE

CORPORATION DOES NOT EXPECT THE PROCEEDINGS TO HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT UPON THE

CORPORATION'S OPERATIONS OR FINANCIAL CONDITION.

FOR 2015 AND 2014, OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS PAID ARE

NET OF $15 MILLION AND $21 MILLION OF MEDICARE SUBSIDY RECEIPTS, RESPECTIVELY.

FOR SELECTION OF THE DISCOUNT RATE FOR

U.S. PLANS, SEVERAL SOURCES OF INFORMATION ARE CONSIDERED, INCLUDING INTEREST

RATE MARKET INDICATORS AND THE DISCOUNT RATE DETERMINED BY USE OF A YIELD CURVE

BASED ON HIGH-QUALITY, NONCALLABLE BONDS WITH CASH FLOWS THAT MATCH ESTIMATED

OUTFLOWS FOR BENEFIT PAYMENTS. FOR MAJOR NON-U.S. PLANS, THE DISCOUNT RATE IS

DETERMINED BY USING BOND PORTFOLIOS WITH AN AVERAGE MATURITY APPROXIMATING THAT

OF THE LIABILITIES OR SPOT YIELD CURVES, BOTH OF WHICH ARE CONSTRUCTED

USING HIGH-QUALITY, LOCAL-CURRENCY-DENOMINATED BONDS.

THE MEASUREMENT OF THE ACCUMULATED

POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATION ASSUMES A HEALTH CARE COST TREND RATE OF 4.5

PERCENT IN 2017 AND SUBSEQUENT YEARS. A ONE-PERCENTAGE-POINT INCREASE IN THE HEALTH

CARE COST TREND RATE WOULD INCREASE SERVICE AND INTEREST COST BY $88 MILLION

AND THE POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATION BY $963 MILLION. A ONE-PERCENTAGE-POINT

DECREASE IN THE HEALTH CARE COST TREND RATE WOULD DECREASE SERVICE AND INTEREST

COST BY $66 MILLION AND THE POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATION BY $764 MILLION.

THE LONG-TERM

EXPECTED RATE OF RETURN ON FUNDED ASSETS SHOWN BELOW IS ESTABLISHED FOR EACH

BENEFIT PLAN BY DEVELOPING A FORWARD-LOOKING, LONG-TERM RETURN ASSUMPTION FOR

EACH ASSET CLASS, TAKING INTO ACCOUNT FACTORS SUCH AS THE EXPECTED REAL

RETURN FOR THE SPECIFIC ASSET CLASS AND INFLATION. A SINGLE, LONG-TERM RATE OF

RETURN IS THEN CALCULATED AS THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE OF THE TARGET ASSET

ALLOCATION PERCENTAGES AND THE LONG-TERM RETURN ASSUMPTION FOR EACH ASSET CLASS.

THE CORPORATION’S INVESTMENT STRATEGY FOR

BENEFIT PLAN ASSETS REFLECTS A LONG-TERM VIEW, A CAREFUL ASSESSMENT OF THE

RISKS INHERENT IN VARIOUS ASSET CLASSES AND BROAD DIVERSIFICATION TO REDUCE THE

RISK OF THE PORTFOLIO. THE BENEFIT PLAN ASSETS ARE PRIMARILY INVESTED IN

PASSIVE EQUITY AND FIXED INCOME INDEX FUNDS TO DIVERSIFY RISK WHILE

MINIMIZING COSTS. THE EQUITY FUNDS HOLD EXXONMOBIL STOCK ONLY TO THE EXTENT

NECESSARY TO REPLICATE THE RELEVANT EQUITY INDEX. THE FIXED INCOME FUNDS ARE

LARGELY INVESTED IN HIGH-QUALITY CORPORATE AND GOVERNMENT DEBT SECURITIES.

STUDIES

ARE PERIODICALLY CONDUCTED TO ESTABLISH THE PREFERRED TARGET ASSET ALLOCATION

PERCENTAGES. THE TARGET ASSET ALLOCATION FOR THE U.S. BENEFIT PLANS AND THE MAJOR

NON-U.S. PLANS IS 40 PERCENT EQUITY SECURITIES AND 60 PERCENT DEBT SECURITIES.

THE EQUITY TARGETS FOR THE U.S. AND NON-U.S. PLANS INCLUDE AN ALLOCATION TO

PRIVATE EQUITY PARTNERSHIPS THAT PRIMARILY FOCUS ON EARLY-STAGE VENTURE CAPITAL

OF 5 PERCENT AND 3 PERCENT, RESPECTIVELY.

THE

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT LEVELS ARE ACCOUNTING TERMS THAT REFER TO DIFFERENT

METHODS OF VALUING ASSETS. THE TERMS DO NOT REPRESENT THE RELATIVE RISK OR

CREDIT QUALITY OF AN INVESTMENT.

18. DISCLOSURES ABOUT SEGMENTS AND RELATED

INFORMATION

THE

UPSTREAM, DOWNSTREAM AND CHEMICAL FUNCTIONS BEST DEFINE THE OPERATING SEGMENTS

OF THE BUSINESS THAT ARE REPORTED SEPARATELY. THE FACTORS USED TO IDENTIFY

THESE REPORTABLE SEGMENTS ARE BASED ON THE NATURE OF THE OPERATIONS THAT ARE

UNDERTAKEN BY EACH SEGMENT. THE UPSTREAM SEGMENT IS ORGANIZED AND OPERATES TO

EXPLORE FOR AND PRODUCE CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS. THE DOWNSTREAM SEGMENT IS

ORGANIZED AND OPERATES TO MANUFACTURE AND SELL PETROLEUM PRODUCTS. THE CHEMICAL

SEGMENT IS ORGANIZED AND OPERATES TO MANUFACTURE AND SELL PETROCHEMICALS. THESE

SEGMENTS ARE BROADLY UNDERSTOOD ACROSS THE PETROLEUM AND PETROCHEMICAL

INDUSTRIES.

THESE

FUNCTIONS HAVE BEEN DEFINED AS THE OPERATING SEGMENTS OF THE CORPORATION

BECAUSE THEY ARE THE SEGMENTS (1) THAT ENGAGE IN BUSINESS ACTIVITIES FROM

WHICH REVENUES ARE EARNED AND EXPENSES ARE INCURRED; (2) WHOSE OPERATING

RESULTS ARE REGULARLY REVIEWED BY THE CORPORATION’S CHIEF OPERATING DECISION

MAKER TO MAKE DECISIONS ABOUT RESOURCES TO BE ALLOCATED TO THE SEGMENT AND TO

ASSESS ITS PERFORMANCE; AND (3) FOR WHICH DISCRETE FINANCIAL INFORMATION

IS AVAILABLE.

EARNINGS

AFTER INCOME TAX INCLUDE TRANSFERS AT ESTIMATED MARKET PRICES.

93

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

IN CORPORATE AND FINANCING ACTIVITIES,

MARKETABLE SECURITIES. INTEREST EXPENSE INCLUDES NON-DEBT-RELATED

INTEREST EXPENSE OF $100 MILLION AND $129 MILLION IN 2015 AND 2014,

RESPECTIVELY. FOR 2013, NON-DEBT-RELATED INTEREST EXPENSE WAS A NET CREDIT OF

$123 MILLION, PRIMARILY REFLECTING THE EFFECT OF CREDITS FROM THE FAVORABLE

RESOLUTION OF PRIOR YEAR TAX POSITIONS.

THE CORPORATION HAD $51 BILLION OF

INDEFINITELY REINVESTED, UNDISTRIBUTED EARNINGS FROM SUBSIDIARY COMPANIES

OUTSIDE THE U.S. THAT WERE RETAINED TO FUND PRIOR AND FUTURE CAPITAL PROJECT

EXPENDITURES. DEFERRED TAXES HAVE NOT BEEN RECORDED FOR POTENTIAL FUTURE TAX

OBLIGATIONS AS THESE EARNINGS ARE EXPECTED TO BE INDEFINITELY REINVESTED FOR

THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2015, IT IS NOT PRACTICAL TO

ESTIMATE THE UNRECOGNIZED DEFERRED TAX LIABILITY ASSOCIATED WITH THESE EARNINGS

GIVEN THE FUTURE AVAILABILITY OF FOREIGN TAX CREDITS AND UNCERTAINTIES ABOUT THE

TIMING OF POTENTIAL REMITTANCES.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS.

THE CORPORATION IS SUBJECT TO INCOME

TAXATION IN MANY JURISDICTIONS AROUND THE WORLD. UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS

REFLECT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN POSITIONS TAKEN OR EXPECTED TO BE TAKEN ON

INCOME TAX RETURNS AND THE AMOUNTS RECOGNIZED IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. THE

FOLLOWING TABLE SUMMARIZES THE MOVEMENT IN UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS.

THE GROSS UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFIT

BALANCES SHOWN ABOVE ARE PREDOMINANTLY RELATED TO TAX POSITIONS THAT WOULD

REDUCE THE CORPORATION’S EFFECTIVE TAX RATE IF THE POSITIONS ARE FAVORABLY

RESOLVED. UNFAVORABLE RESOLUTION OF THESE TAX POSITIONS GENERALLY WOULD NOT

INCREASE THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE. THE 2015, 2014 AND 2013 CHANGES IN

UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS DID NOT HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE CORPORATION’S

NET INCOME.

RESOLUTION

OF THESE TAX POSITIONS THROUGH NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE RELEVANT TAX AUTHORITIES

OR THROUGH LITIGATION WILL TAKE MANY YEARS TO COMPLETE. IT IS DIFFICULT TO

PREDICT THE TIMING OF RESOLUTION FOR TAX POSITIONS SINCE SUCH TIMING IS NOT

ENTIRELY WITHIN THE CONTROL OF THE CORPORATION. IN THE UNITED STATES, THE

CORPORATION HAS VARIOUS U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX POSITIONS AT ISSUE WITH THE

INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE FOR TAX YEARS 2006-2011. UNFAVORABLE RESOLUTION OF

THESE ISSUES WOULD NOT HAVE A MATERIALLY ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE CORPORATION’S

NET INCOME OR LIQUIDITY. THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE HAS NOT COMPLETED ITS

AUDIT OF TAX YEARS AFTER 2011.

IT

IS REASONABLY POSSIBLE THAT THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS COULD

INCREASE BY UP TO 20 PERCENT IN THE NEXT 12 MONTHS, WITH NO MATERIAL IMPACT ON

THE CORPORATION’S NET INCOME.

THE CORPORATION

INCURRED $39 MILLION AND $42 MILLION IN INTEREST EXPENSE ON INCOME TAX RESERVES

EXPENSE WAS A CREDIT OF $207 MILLION, REFLECTING THE EFFECT OF CREDITS FROM THE

FAVORABLE RESOLUTION OF PRIOR YEAR TAX POSITIONS. THE RELATED INTEREST PAYABLE

BALANCES WERE $223 MILLION AND $205 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2015, AND 2014,

RESPECTIVELY.

OIL AND

GAS RESERVES

THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION DESCRIBES CHANGES DURING THE

YEARS AND BALANCES OF PROVED OIL AND GAS RESERVES AT YEAR-END 2013, 2014, AND

2015.

THE

DEFINITIONS USED ARE IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE

COMMISSION’S RULE 4-10 (A) OF REGULATION S-X.

PROVED

OIL AND GAS RESERVES ARE THOSE QUANTITIES OF OIL AND GAS, WHICH, BY ANALYSIS OF

GEOSCIENCE AND ENGINEERING DATA, CAN BE ESTIMATED WITH REASONABLE CERTAINTY TO

BE ECONOMICALLY PRODUCIBLE – FROM A GIVEN DATE FORWARD, FROM KNOWN RESERVOIRS,

AND UNDER EXISTING ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, OPERATING METHODS AND GOVERNMENT

REGULATIONS – PRIOR TO THE TIME AT WHICH CONTRACTS PROVIDING THE RIGHT TO

OPERATE EXPIRE, UNLESS EVIDENCE INDICATES THAT RENEWAL IS REASONABLY CERTAIN.

IN SOME CASES, SUBSTANTIAL NEW INVESTMENTS IN ADDITIONAL WELLS AND RELATED

FACILITIES WILL BE REQUIRED TO RECOVER THESE PROVED RESERVES.

IN

ACCORDANCE WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION’S (SEC) RULES, THE

YEAR-END RESERVES VOLUMES AS WELL AS THE RESERVES CHANGE CATEGORIES SHOWN IN

THE FOLLOWING TABLES WERE CALCULATED USING AVERAGE PRICES DURING THE 12-MONTH

PERIOD PRIOR TO THE ENDING DATE OF THE PERIOD COVERED BY THE REPORT, DETERMINED

AS AN UNWEIGHTED ARITHMETIC AVERAGE OF THE FIRST-DAY-OF-THE-MONTH PRICE FOR

EACH MONTH WITHIN SUCH PERIOD. THESE RESERVES QUANTITIES ARE ALSO USED IN

CALCULATING UNIT-OF-PRODUCTION DEPRECIATION RATES AND IN CALCULATING THE

STANDARDIZED MEASURE OF DISCOUNTED NET CASH FLOW.

REVISIONS

CAN INCLUDE UPWARD OR DOWNWARD CHANGES IN PREVIOUSLY ESTIMATED VOLUMES OF

PROVED RESERVES FOR EXISTING FIELDS DUE TO THE EVALUATION OR RE-EVALUATION OF

(1) ALREADY AVAILABLE GEOLOGIC, RESERVOIR OR PRODUCTION DATA, (2) NEW

GEOLOGIC, RESERVOIR OR PRODUCTION DATA OR (3) CHANGES IN AVERAGE PRICES

AND YEAR-END COSTS THAT ARE USED IN THE ESTIMATION OF RESERVES. THIS CATEGORY

CAN ALSO INCLUDE SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN EITHER DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY OR

PRODUCTION EQUIPMENT/FACILITY CAPACITY.

WHEN

CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS PRICES ARE IN THE RANGE SEEN IN LATE 2015 AND EARLY

2016 FOR AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF TIME, UNDER THE SEC DEFINITION OF PROVED

RESERVES, CERTAIN QUANTITIES OF OIL AND NATURAL GAS, SUCH AS OIL SANDS OPERATIONS

IN CANADA AND NATURAL GAS OPERATIONS IN NORTH AMERICA COULD TEMPORARILY NOT

QUALIFY AS PROVED RESERVES. AMOUNTS THAT COULD BE REQUIRED TO BE DE-BOOKED AS

PROVED RESERVES ON AN SEC BASIS ARE SUBJECT TO BEING RE-BOOKED AS PROVED

RESERVES AT SOME POINT IN THE FUTURE WHEN PRICE LEVELS RECOVER, COSTS DECLINE,

OR OPERATING EFFICIENCIES OCCUR. UNDER THE TERMS OF CERTAIN CONTRACTUAL

ARRANGEMENTS OR GOVERNMENT ROYALTY REGIMES, LOWER PRICES CAN ALSO INCREASE

PROVED RESERVES ATTRIBUTABLE TO EXXONMOBIL. WE DO NOT EXPECT ANY TEMPORARY

CHANGES IN REPORTED PROVED RESERVES UNDER SEC DEFINITIONS TO AFFECT THE

OPERATION OF THE UNDERLYING PROJECTS OR TO ALTER OUR OUTLOOK FOR FUTURE

PRODUCTION VOLUMES.

PROVED

RESERVES INCLUDE 100 PERCENT OF EACH MAJORITY-OWNED AFFILIATE’S PARTICIPATION

IN PROVED RESERVES AND EXXONMOBIL’S OWNERSHIP PERCENTAGE OF THE PROVED RESERVES

OF EQUITY COMPANIES, BUT EXCLUDE ROYALTIES AND QUANTITIES DUE OTHERS. GAS

RESERVES EXCLUDE THE GASEOUS EQUIVALENT OF LIQUIDS EXPECTED TO BE REMOVED FROM

THE GAS ON LEASES, AT FIELD FACILITIES AND AT GAS PROCESSING PLANTS. THESE

LIQUIDS ARE INCLUDED IN NET PROVED RESERVES OF CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS

LIQUIDS.

IN

THE PROVED RESERVES TABLES, CONSOLIDATED RESERVES AND EQUITY COMPANY RESERVES

ARE REPORTED SEPARATELY. HOWEVER, THE CORPORATION DOES NOT VIEW EQUITY COMPANY

RESERVES ANY DIFFERENTLY THAN THOSE FROM CONSOLIDATED COMPANIES.

RESERVES

REPORTED UNDER PRODUCTION SHARING AND OTHER NONCONCESSIONARY AGREEMENTS ARE

BASED ON THE ECONOMIC INTEREST AS DEFINED BY THE SPECIFIC FISCAL TERMS IN THE

AGREEMENT. THE PRODUCTION AND RESERVES THAT WE REPORT FOR THESE TYPES OF

ARRANGEMENTS TYPICALLY VARY INVERSELY WITH OIL AND GAS PRICE CHANGES. AS OIL

AND GAS PRICES INCREASE, THE CASH FLOW AND VALUE RECEIVED BY THE COMPANY

INCREASE; HOWEVER, THE PRODUCTION VOLUMES AND RESERVES REQUIRED TO ACHIEVE THIS

VALUE WILL TYPICALLY BE LOWER BECAUSE OF THE HIGHER PRICES. WHEN PRICES

DECREASE, THE OPPOSITE EFFECT GENERALLY OCCURS. THE PERCENTAGE OF TOTAL LIQUIDS

AND NATURAL GAS PROVED RESERVES (CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES PLUS EQUITY

COMPANIES) AT YEAR-END 2015 THAT WERE ASSOCIATED WITH PRODUCTION SHARING

CONTRACT ARRANGEMENTS WAS 10 PERCENT OF LIQUIDS, 10 PERCENT OF NATURAL GAS AND 10

PERCENT ON AN OIL-EQUIVALENT BASIS (GAS CONVERTED TO OIL-EQUIVALENT AT 6

BILLION CUBIC FEET = 1 MILLION BARRELS).

NET

PROVED DEVELOPED RESERVES ARE THOSE VOLUMES THAT ARE EXPECTED TO BE RECOVERED

THROUGH EXISTING WELLS WITH EXISTING EQUIPMENT AND OPERATING METHODS OR IN

WHICH THE COST OF THE REQUIRED EQUIPMENT IS RELATIVELY MINOR COMPARED TO THE

COST OF A NEW WELL. NET PROVED UNDEVELOPED RESERVES ARE THOSE VOLUMES THAT ARE

EXPECTED TO BE RECOVERED FROM NEW WELLS ON UNDRILLED ACREAGE, OR FROM EXISTING

WELLS WHERE A RELATIVELY MAJOR EXPENDITURE IS REQUIRED FOR RECOMPLETION.

CRUDE

OIL AND NATURAL GAS LIQUIDS AND NATURAL GAS PRODUCTION QUANTITIES SHOWN ARE THE

NET VOLUMES WITHDRAWN FROM EXXONMOBIL’S OIL AND GAS RESERVES. THE NATURAL GAS

QUANTITIES DIFFER FROM THE QUANTITIES OF GAS DELIVERED FOR SALE BY THE

PRODUCING FUNCTION AS REPORTED IN THE OPERATING SUMMARY DUE TO VOLUMES CONSUMED

OR FLARED AND INVENTORY CHANGES.

THE

CHANGES BETWEEN 2014 YEAR-END PROVED RESERVES AND 2015 YEAR-END PROVED RESERVES

PRIMARILY REFLECT EXTENSIONS AND PURCHASES IN THE UNITED STATES AND ASIA, AND

REVISIONS IN THE UNITED STATES AND CANADA. DUE TO LOW NATURAL GAS PRICES DURING

2015, THE CORPORATION RECLASSIFIED APPROXIMATELY 4,800 BILLION CUBIC FEET OF

NATURAL GAS RESERVES IN THE UNITED STATES WHICH NO LONGER MEET THE SEC

DEFINITION OF PROVED RESERVES.

STANDARDIZED MEASURE OF DISCOUNTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS

AS REQUIRED BY THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING

STANDARDS BOARD, THE STANDARDIZED MEASURE OF DISCOUNTED FUTURE NET CASH FLOWS

IS COMPUTED BY APPLYING FIRST-DAY-OF-THE-MONTH AVERAGE PRICES,

YEAR-END COSTS AND LEGISLATED TAX RATES AND A DISCOUNT FACTOR OF 10 PERCENT

TO NET PROVED RESERVES. THE STANDARDIZED MEASURE INCLUDES COSTS FOR

FUTURE DISMANTLEMENT, ABANDONMENT AND REHABILITATION OBLIGATIONS.

THE CORPORATION BELIEVES THE STANDARDIZED MEASURE DOES NOT PROVIDE

A RELIABLE ESTIMATE OF THE CORPORATION’S EXPECTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS TO BE

OBTAINED FROM THE DEVELOPMENT AND PRODUCTION OF ITS OIL AND GAS PROPERTIES OR

OF THE VALUE OF ITS PROVED OIL AND GAS RESERVES. THE STANDARDIZED MEASURE IS

PREPARED ON THE BASIS OF CERTAIN PRESCRIBED ASSUMPTIONS INCLUDING

FIRST-DAY-OF-THE-MONTH AVERAGE PRICES, WHICH REPRESENT DISCRETE POINTS IN TIME

AND THEREFORE MAY CAUSE SIGNIFICANT VARIABILITY IN CASH FLOWS FROM YEAR TO YEAR

AS PRICES CHANGE.
