ITEM 1.

BUSINESS.

EXXON MOBIL CORPORATION WAS INCORPORATED IN THE STATE OF NEW

JERSEY IN 1882. DIVISIONS AND AFFILIATED COMPANIES OF EXXONMOBIL OPERATE OR MARKET PRODUCTS IN THE UNITED STATES AND MOST OTHER COUNTRIES OF THE WORLD. THEIR PRINCIPAL BUSINESS IS ENERGY, INVOLVING EXPLORATION FOR, AND PRODUCTION OF, CRUDE OIL AND

NATURAL GAS, MANUFACTURE OF PETROLEUM PRODUCTS AND TRANSPORTATION AND SALE OF CRUDE OIL, NATURAL GAS AND PETROLEUM PRODUCTS. EXXONMOBIL IS A MAJOR MANUFACTURER AND MARKETER OF COMMODITY PETROCHEMICALS, INCLUDING OLEFINS, AROMATICS, POLYETHYLENE AND

POLYPROPYLENE PLASTICS AND A WIDE VARIETY OF SPECIALTY PRODUCTS. EXXONMOBIL ALSO HAS INTERESTS IN ELECTRIC POWER GENERATION FACILITIES. AFFILIATES OF EXXONMOBIL CONDUCT EXTENSIVE RESEARCH PROGRAMS IN SUPPORT OF THESE BUSINESSES.

EXXON MOBIL CORPORATION HAS SEVERAL DIVISIONS AND HUNDREDS OF

AFFILIATES, MANY WITH NAMES THAT INCLUDE

EXXONMOBIL, EXXON, ESSO

OR

MOBIL

. FOR CONVENIENCE AND SIMPLICITY, IN THIS REPORT THE TERMS

EXXONMOBIL, EXXON, ESSO

AND

MOBIL

, AS WELL AS TERMS LIKE

CORPORATION, COMPANY, OUR,

WE

AND

ITS

, ARE SOMETIMES USED AS ABBREVIATED REFERENCES TO SPECIFIC AFFILIATES OR GROUPS OF AFFILIATES. THE PRECISE MEANING DEPENDS ON THE CONTEXT IN QUESTION.

ON DECEMBER 13, 2009, EXXONMOBIL AND XTO ENERGY INC. ENTERED INTO AN AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER. UNDER THE TERMS OF THE

AGREEMENT, (I) EACH SHARE OF XTO ENERGY COMMON STOCK WILL BE CONVERTED INTO THE RIGHT TO RECEIVE 0.7098 SHARES OF COMMON STOCK OF THE CORPORATION (THE EXCHANGE RATIO) AND (II) ALL OUTSTANDING XTO ENERGY OPTIONS WILL BE CONVERTED INTO

OPTIONS TO PURCHASE SHARES OF COMMON STOCK OF THE CORPORATION, WITH THE NUMBER OF SHARES OF XTO ENERGY COMMON STOCK SUBJECT TO THE OPTION, AND THE OPTIONS EXERCISE PRICE, ADJUSTED BASED ON THE EXCHANGE RATIO. THE TRANSACTION INCLUDES XTO

ENERGY DEBT, WHICH WAS APPROXIMATELY $10.5 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2009. CONSUMMATION OF THE MERGER IS SUBJECT TO REGULATORY CLEARANCE, XTO ENERGY STOCKHOLDER APPROVAL, AND OTHER CUSTOMARY CONDITIONS.

THROUGHOUT EXXONMOBILS BUSINESSES, NEW AND ONGOING

MEASURES ARE TAKEN TO PREVENT AND MINIMIZE THE IMPACT OF OUR OPERATIONS ON AIR, WATER AND GROUND. THESE INCLUDE A SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT IN REFINING INFRASTRUCTURE AND TECHNOLOGY TO MANUFACTURE CLEAN FUELS AS WELL AS PROJECTS TO MONITOR AND REDUCE

NITROGEN OXIDE, SULFUR OXIDE, AND GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS AND EXPENDITURES FOR ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS. EXXONMOBILS 2009 WORLDWIDE ENVIRONMENTAL EXPENDITURES FOR ALL SUCH PREVENTATIVE AND REMEDIATION STEPS, INCLUDING EXXONMOBILS

SHARE OF EQUITY COMPANY EXPENDITURES, WERE ABOUT $5.1 BILLION, OF WHICH $2.5 BILLION WERE CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND $2.6 BILLION WERE INCLUDED IN EXPENSES. THE TOTAL COST FOR SUCH ACTIVITIES IS EXPECTED TO REMAIN IN THIS RANGE IN 2010 AND

2011 (WITH CAPITAL EXPENDITURES APPROXIMATELY 45 PERCENT OF THE TOTAL).

THE ENERGY AND PETROCHEMICAL INDUSTRIES ARE HIGHLY COMPETITIVE. THERE IS COMPETITION WITHIN THE INDUSTRIES AND ALSO WITH OTHER INDUSTRIES IN SUPPLYING THE ENERGY, FUEL AND CHEMICAL NEEDS OF BOTH

INDUSTRIAL AND INDIVIDUAL CONSUMERS. THE CORPORATION COMPETES WITH OTHER FIRMS IN THE SALE OR PURCHASE OF NEEDED GOODS AND SERVICES IN MANY NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL MARKETS AND EMPLOYS ALL METHODS OF COMPETITION WHICH ARE LAWFUL AND APPROPRIATE

FOR SUCH PURPOSES.

OPERATING DATA AND INDUSTRY

SEGMENT INFORMATION FOR THE CORPORATION ARE CONTAINED IN THE FINANCIAL SECTION OF THIS REPORT UNDER THE FOLLOWING: QUARTERLY INFORMATION, NOTE 17: DISCLOSURES ABOUT SEGMENTS AND RELATED INFORMATION AND OPERATING

SUMMARY. INFORMATION ON OIL AND GAS RESERVES IS CONTAINED IN THE OIL AND GAS RESERVES PART OF THE SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION ON OIL AND GAS EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION ACTIVITIES PORTION OF THE FINANCIAL SECTION OF THIS

REPORT.

SEGMENTS. INFORMATION ON COMPANY-SPONSORED RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT SPENDING IS CONTAINED IN NOTE 3: MISCELLANEOUS FINANCIAL INFORMATION OF THE FINANCIAL SECTION OF THIS REPORT.

EXXONMOBIL HELD APPROXIMATELY 11 THOUSAND ACTIVE PATENTS WORLDWIDE AT THE END OF 2009. FOR TECHNOLOGY LICENSED TO THIRD PARTIES, REVENUES TOTALED APPROXIMATELY $88 MILLION IN 2009. ALTHOUGH TECHNOLOGY IS AN IMPORTANT CONTRIBUTOR TO THE OVERALL

OPERATIONS AND RESULTS OF OUR COMPANY, THE PROFITABILITY OF EACH BUSINESS SEGMENT IS NOT DEPENDENT ON ANY INDIVIDUAL PATENT, TRADE SECRET, TRADEMARK, LICENSE, FRANCHISE OR CONCESSION.

THE NUMBER OF REGULAR EMPLOYEES WAS 80.7 THOUSAND, 79.9 THOUSAND AND 80.8 THOUSAND AT YEARS ENDED 2009, 2008

AND 2007, RESPECTIVELY. REGULAR EMPLOYEES ARE DEFINED AS ACTIVE EXECUTIVE, MANAGEMENT, PROFESSIONAL, TECHNICAL AND WAGE EMPLOYEES WHO WORK FULL TIME OR PART TIME FOR THE CORPORATION AND ARE COVERED BY THE CORPORATIONS BENEFIT PLANS AND

PROGRAMS. REGULAR EMPLOYEES DO NOT INCLUDE EMPLOYEES OF THE COMPANY-OPERATED RETAIL SITES (CORS). THE NUMBER OF CORS EMPLOYEES WAS 22.0 THOUSAND, 24.8 THOUSAND AND 26.3 THOUSAND AT YEARS ENDED 2009, 2008 AND 2007, RESPECTIVELY.

INFORMATION CONCERNING THE SOURCE AND AVAILABILITY OF RAW

MATERIALS USED IN THE CORPORATIONS BUSINESS, THE EXTENT OF SEASONALITY IN THE BUSINESS, THE POSSIBILITY OF RENEGOTIATION OF PROFITS OR TERMINATION OF CONTRACTS AT THE ELECTION OF GOVERNMENTS AND RISKS ATTENDANT TO FOREIGN OPERATIONS MAY BE

ITEM 1A.

RISK FACTORS.

EXXONMOBILS FINANCIAL AND OPERATING RESULTS ARE SUBJECT TO A VARIETY OF RISKS INHERENT IN THE GLOBAL OIL,

GAS, AND PETROCHEMICAL BUSINESSES. MANY OF THESE RISK FACTORS ARE NOT WITHIN THE COMPANYS CONTROL AND COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, OUR FINANCIAL AND OPERATING RESULTS OR OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION. WE DISCUSS SOME OF THESE RISKS IN MORE

DETAIL BELOW.

SUPPLY AND DEMAND.

THE OIL, GAS, AND PETROCHEMICAL BUSINESSES ARE FUNDAMENTALLY

COMMODITY BUSINESSES. THIS MEANS EXXONMOBILS OPERATIONS AND EARNINGS MAY BE SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTED BY CHANGES IN OIL, GAS AND PETROCHEMICAL PRICES AND BY CHANGES IN MARGINS ON REFINED PRODUCTS. OIL, GAS, PETROCHEMICAL AND PRODUCT PRICES AND

MARGINS IN TURN DEPEND ON LOCAL, REGIONAL AND GLOBAL EVENTS OR CONDITIONS THAT AFFECT SUPPLY AND DEMAND FOR THE RELEVANT COMMODITY.

ECONOMIC CONDITIONS.

THE DEMAND FOR ENERGY AND PETROCHEMICALS CORRELATES CLOSELY WITH GENERAL ECONOMIC

GROWTH RATES. THE OCCURRENCE OF RECESSIONS OR OTHER PERIODS OF LOW OR NEGATIVE ECONOMIC GROWTH WILL TYPICALLY HAVE A DIRECT ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR RESULTS. OTHER FACTORS THAT AFFECT GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS IN THE WORLD OR IN A MAJOR REGION, SUCH

AS CHANGES IN POPULATION GROWTH RATES OR PERIODS OF CIVIL UNREST, ALSO IMPACT THE DEMAND FOR ENERGY AND PETROCHEMICALS. ECONOMIC CONDITIONS THAT IMPAIR THE FUNCTIONING OF FINANCIAL MARKETS AND INSTITUTIONS ALSO POSE RISKS TO EXXONMOBIL, INCLUDING

RISKS TO THE SAFETY OF OUR FINANCIAL ASSETS AND TO THE ABILITY OF OUR PARTNERS AND CUSTOMERS TO FULFILL THEIR COMMITMENTS TO EXXONMOBIL.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

INDEX TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

OTHER DEMAND-RELATED FACTORS.

OTHER FACTORS THAT MAY

AFFECT THE DEMAND FOR OIL, GAS AND PETROCHEMICALS, AND THEREFORE IMPACT OUR RESULTS, INCLUDE TECHNOLOGICAL IMPROVEMENTS IN ENERGY

EFFICIENCY; SEASONAL WEATHER PATTERNS, WHICH AFFECT THE DEMAND FOR ENERGY ASSOCIATED WITH HEATING AND

COOLING; INCREASED COMPETITIVENESS OF ALTERNATIVE ENERGY SOURCES THAT HAVE SO FAR GENERALLY NOT BEEN COMPETITIVE WITH OIL AND GAS WITHOUT THE BENEFIT OF GOVERNMENT SUBSIDIES OR MANDATES; AND CHANGES IN TECHNOLOGY OR CONSUMER PREFERENCES THAT ALTER

FUEL CHOICES, SUCH AS TOWARD ALTERNATIVE FUELED VEHICLES.

OTHER SUPPLY-RELATED FACTORS.

COMMODITY PRICES AND MARGINS ALSO VARY DEPENDING ON A NUMBER OF FACTORS AFFECTING SUPPLY. FOR EXAMPLE, INCREASED SUPPLY FROM THE

DEVELOPMENT OF NEW OIL AND GAS SUPPLY SOURCES AND TECHNOLOGIES TO ENHANCE RECOVERY FROM EXISTING SOURCES TEND TO REDUCE COMMODITY PRICES TO THE EXTENT SUCH SUPPLY INCREASES ARE NOT OFFSET BY COMMENSURATE GROWTH IN DEMAND. SIMILARLY, INCREASES IN

INDUSTRY REFINING OR PETROCHEMICAL MANUFACTURING CAPACITY TEND TO REDUCE MARGINS ON THE AFFECTED PRODUCTS. WORLD OIL, GAS, AND PETROCHEMICAL SUPPLY LEVELS CAN ALSO BE AFFECTED BY FACTORS THAT REDUCE AVAILABLE SUPPLIES, SUCH AS ADHERENCE BY MEMBER

COUNTRIES TO OPEC PRODUCTION QUOTAS AND THE OCCURRENCE OF WARS, HOSTILE ACTIONS, OR NATURAL DISASTERS THAT MAY DISRUPT SUPPLIES. TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE CAN ALSO ALTER THE RELATIVE COSTS FOR COMPETITORS TO FIND, PRODUCE, AND REFINE OIL AND GAS AND TO

MANUFACTURE PETROCHEMICALS.

OTHER MARKET

FACTORS.

EXXONMOBILS BUSINESS RESULTS ARE ALSO EXPOSED TO POTENTIAL NEGATIVE IMPACTS DUE TO CHANGES IN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES, INTEREST RATES, INFLATION, AND OTHER LOCAL OR REGIONAL MARKET CONDITIONS. WE

GENERALLY DO NOT USE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS TO HEDGE MARKET EXPOSURES.

GOVERNMENT AND POLITICAL FACTORS.

EXXONMOBILS RESULTS CAN BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY POLITICAL OR REGULATORY DEVELOPMENTS AFFECTING OUR OPERATIONS.

ACCESS LIMITATIONS.

A NUMBER OF COUNTRIES LIMIT ACCESS TO THEIR OIL AND GAS RESOURCES, OR MAY PLACE

RESOURCES OFF-LIMITS FROM DEVELOPMENT ALTOGETHER. RESTRICTIONS ON FOREIGN INVESTMENT IN THE OIL AND GAS SECTOR TEND TO INCREASE IN TIMES OF HIGH COMMODITY PRICES, WHEN NATIONAL GOVERNMENTS MAY HAVE LESS NEED OF OUTSIDE SOURCES OF PRIVATE CAPITAL.

MANY COUNTRIES ALSO RESTRICT THE IMPORT OR EXPORT OF CERTAIN PRODUCTS BASED ON POINT OF ORIGIN.

RESTRICTIONS ON DOING BUSINESS.

AS A U.S. COMPANY, EXXONMOBIL IS SUBJECT TO LAWS PROHIBITING U.S.

COMPANIES FROM DOING BUSINESS IN CERTAIN COUNTRIES, OR RESTRICTING THE KIND OF BUSINESS THAT MAY BE CONDUCTED. SUCH RESTRICTIONS MAY PROVIDE A COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE TO OUR NON-U.S. COMPETITORS UNLESS THEIR OWN HOME COUNTRIES IMPOSE COMPARABLE

RESTRICTIONS.

LACK OF LEGAL

CERTAINTY.

SOME COUNTRIES IN WHICH WE DO BUSINESS LACK WELL-DEVELOPED LEGAL SYSTEMS, OR HAVE NOT YET ADOPTED CLEAR REGULATORY FRAMEWORKS FOR OIL AND GAS DEVELOPMENT. LACK OF LEGAL CERTAINTY EXPOSES OUR OPERATIONS TO

INCREASED RISK OF ADVERSE OR UNPREDICTABLE ACTIONS BY GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS, AND ALSO MAKES IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR US TO ENFORCE OUR CONTRACTS. IN SOME CASES THESE RISKS CAN BE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AGREEMENTS TO ARBITRATE DISPUTES IN AN INTERNATIONAL

FORUM, BUT THE ADEQUACY OF THIS REMEDY MAY STILL DEPEND ON THE LOCAL LEGAL SYSTEM TO ENFORCE AN AWARD.

REGULATORY AND LITIGATION RISKS.

EVEN IN COUNTRIES WITH WELL-DEVELOPED LEGAL SYSTEMS WHERE EXXONMOBIL

DOES BUSINESS, WE REMAIN EXPOSED TO CHANGES IN LAW (INCLUDING CHANGES THAT RESULT FROM INTERNATIONAL TREATIES AND ACCORDS) THAT COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS, SUCH AS INCREASES IN TAXES OR GOVERNMENT ROYALTY RATES (INCLUDING RETROACTIVE

CLAIMS); PRICE CONTROLS; CHANGES IN ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS OR OTHER LAWS THAT INCREASE OUR COST OF COMPLIANCE; ADOPTION OF REGULATIONS MANDATING THE USE OF ALTERNATIVE FUELS OR UNCOMPETITIVE FUEL COMPONENTS; GOVERNMENT ACTIONS TO CANCEL CONTRACTS

OR RENEGOTIATE TERMS UNILATERALLY; AND EXPROPRIATION. LEGAL REMEDIES AVAILABLE TO COMPENSATE US FOR

3

TABLE OF CONTENTS

INDEX TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

EXPROPRIATION OR OTHER TAKINGS MAY BE INADEQUATE. WE ALSO MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY THE OUTCOME OF LITIGATION OR OTHER LEGAL PROCEEDINGS, ESPECIALLY IN COUNTRIES SUCH AS THE UNITED STATES IN

WHICH VERY LARGE AND UNPREDICTABLE PUNITIVE DAMAGE AWARDS MAY OCCUR.

SECURITY CONCERNS.

SUCCESSFUL OPERATION OF PARTICULAR FACILITIES OR PROJECTS MAY BE DISRUPTED BY CIVIL UNREST, ACTS OF SABOTAGE OR TERRORISM, AND OTHER LOCAL SECURITY

CONCERNS. SUCH CONCERNS MAY REQUIRE US TO INCUR GREATER COSTS FOR SECURITY OR TO SHUT DOWN OPERATIONS FOR A PERIOD OF TIME.

CLIMATE CHANGE AND GREENHOUSE GAS RESTRICTIONS.

DUE TO CONCERN OVER THE RISK OF CLIMATE CHANGE, A NUMBER

OF COUNTRIES HAVE ADOPTED, OR ARE CONSIDERING THE ADOPTION OF, REGULATORY FRAMEWORKS TO REDUCE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS. THESE INCLUDE ADOPTION OF CAP AND TRADE REGIMES, CARBON TAXES, INCREASED EFFICIENCY STANDARDS, AND INCENTIVES OR MANDATES FOR

RENEWABLE ENERGY. THESE REQUIREMENTS COULD MAKE OUR PRODUCTS MORE EXPENSIVE AND REDUCE DEMAND FOR HYDROCARBONS, AS WELL AS SHIFTING HYDROCARBON DEMAND TOWARD RELATIVELY LOWER-CARBON SOURCES SUCH AS NATURAL GAS. CURRENT AND PENDING GREENHOUSE GAS

REGULATIONS MAY ALSO INCREASE OUR COMPLIANCE COSTS, SUCH AS FOR MONITORING OR SEQUESTERING EMISSIONS.

GOVERNMENT SPONSORSHIP OF ALTERNATIVE ENERGY.

MANY GOVERNMENTS ARE PROVIDING TAX ADVANTAGES AND OTHER

SUBSIDIES AND MANDATES TO MAKE ALTERNATIVE ENERGY SOURCES MORE COMPETITIVE AGAINST OIL AND GAS. GOVERNMENTS ARE ALSO PROMOTING RESEARCH INTO NEW TECHNOLOGIES TO REDUCE THE COST AND INCREASE THE SCALABILITY OF ALTERNATIVE ENERGY SOURCES. WE ARE

CONDUCTING OUR OWN RESEARCH EFFORTS INTO ALTERNATIVE ENERGY, SUCH AS THROUGH SPONSORSHIP OF THE GLOBAL CLIMATE AND ENERGY PROJECT AT STANFORD UNIVERSITY AND RESEARCH INTO HYDROGEN FUEL CELLS AND FUEL-PRODUCING ALGAE. OUR FUTURE RESULTS MAY DEPEND IN

PART ON THE SUCCESS OF OUR RESEARCH EFFORTS AND ON OUR ABILITY TO ADAPT AND APPLY THE STRENGTHS OF OUR CURRENT BUSINESS MODEL TO PROVIDING THE COMPETITIVE ENERGY PRODUCTS OF THE FUTURE. SEE MANAGEMENT EFFECTIVENESS BELOW.

MANAGEMENT EFFECTIVENESS.

IN ADDITION TO EXTERNAL ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL FACTORS, OUR

FUTURE BUSINESS RESULTS ALSO DEPEND ON OUR ABILITY TO MANAGE SUCCESSFULLY THOSE FACTORS THAT ARE AT LEAST IN PART WITHIN OUR CONTROL. THE EXTENT TO WHICH WE MANAGE THESE FACTORS WILL IMPACT OUR PERFORMANCE RELATIVE TO COMPETITION.

EXPLORATION AND DEVELOPMENT

PROGRAM.

OUR ABILITY TO MAINTAIN AND GROW OUR OIL AND GAS PRODUCTION DEPENDS ON THE SUCCESS OF OUR EXPLORATION AND DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS. AMONG OTHER FACTORS, WE MUST CONTINUOUSLY IMPROVE OUR ABILITY TO IDENTIFY THE MOST

PROMISING RESOURCE PROSPECTS AND APPLY OUR PROJECT MANAGEMENT EXPERTISE TO BRING DISCOVERED RESOURCES ON LINE ON SCHEDULE.

PROJECT MANAGEMENT.

THE SUCCESS OF EXXONMOBILS UPSTREAM, DOWNSTREAM, AND CHEMICAL BUSINESSES

DEPENDS ON COMPLEX, LONG-TERM, CAPITAL INTENSIVE PROJECTS. THESE PROJECTS IN TURN REQUIRE A HIGH DEGREE OF PROJECT MANAGEMENT EXPERTISE TO MAXIMIZE EFFICIENCY. SPECIFIC FACTORS THAT CAN AFFECT THE PERFORMANCE OF MAJOR PROJECTS INCLUDE OUR ABILITY

TO: NEGOTIATE SUCCESSFULLY WITH JOINT VENTURERS, PARTNERS, GOVERNMENTS, SUPPLIERS, CUSTOMERS, OR OTHERS; MODEL AND OPTIMIZE RESERVOIR PERFORMANCE; DEVELOP MARKETS FOR PROJECT OUTPUTS, WHETHER THROUGH LONG-TERM CONTRACTS OR THE DEVELOPMENT OF

EFFECTIVE SPOT MARKETS; MANAGE CHANGES IN OPERATING CONDITIONS AND COSTS, INCLUDING COSTS OF THIRD PARTY EQUIPMENT OR SERVICES SUCH AS DRILLING RIGS AND SHIPPING; PREVENT, TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE, AND RESPOND EFFECTIVELY TO UNFORESEEN TECHNICAL

DIFFICULTIES THAT COULD DELAY PROJECT STARTUP OR CAUSE UNSCHEDULED PROJECT DOWNTIME; AND INFLUENCE THE PERFORMANCE OF PROJECT OPERATORS WHERE EXXONMOBIL DOES NOT PERFORM THAT ROLE.

OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCY.

AN IMPORTANT COMPONENT OF EXXONMOBILS

COMPETITIVE PERFORMANCE, ESPECIALLY GIVEN THE COMMODITY-BASED NATURE OF MANY OF OUR BUSINESSES, IS OUR ABILITY TO OPERATE

4

TABLE OF CONTENTS

INDEX TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

EFFICIENTLY, INCLUDING OUR ABILITY TO MANAGE EXPENSES AND IMPROVE PRODUCTION YIELDS ON AN ONGOING BASIS. THIS REQUIRES CONTINUOUS MANAGEMENT FOCUS, INCLUDING TECHNOLOGY IMPROVEMENTS, COST

CONTROL, PRODUCTIVITY ENHANCEMENTS AND REGULAR REAPPRAISAL OF OUR ASSET PORTFOLIO.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT.

TO MAINTAIN OUR COMPETITIVE POSITION, ESPECIALLY IN LIGHT OF THE TECHNOLOGICAL NATURE OF OUR BUSINESSES AND THE NEED FOR CONTINUOUS

EFFICIENCY IMPROVEMENT, EXXONMOBILS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ORGANIZATIONS MUST BE SUCCESSFUL AND ABLE TO ADAPT TO A CHANGING MARKET AND POLICY ENVIRONMENT.

SAFETY, BUSINESS CONTROLS, AND ENVIRONMENTAL RISK MANAGEMENT.

OUR RESULTS

DEPEND ON MANAGEMENTS ABILITY TO MINIMIZE THE INHERENT RISKS OF OIL, GAS, AND PETROCHEMICAL OPERATIONS AND TO CONTROL EFFECTIVELY OUR BUSINESS ACTIVITIES. WE APPLY RIGOROUS MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS AND CONTINUOUS FOCUS TO WORKPLACE SAFETY AND TO

AVOIDING SPILLS OR OTHER ADVERSE ENVIRONMENTAL EVENTS. FOR EXAMPLE, WE WORK TO MINIMIZE SPILLS THROUGH A COMBINED PROGRAM OF EFFECTIVE OPERATIONS INTEGRITY MANAGEMENT, ONGOING UPGRADES, KEY EQUIPMENT REPLACEMENTS, AND COMPREHENSIVE INSPECTION AND

SURVEILLANCE. SIMILARLY, WE ARE IMPLEMENTING COST-EFFECTIVE NEW TECHNOLOGIES AND ADOPTING NEW OPERATING PRACTICES TO REDUCE AIR EMISSIONS, NOT ONLY IN RESPONSE TO GOVERNMENT REQUIREMENTS BUT ALSO TO ADDRESS COMMUNITY PRIORITIES. WE ALSO MAINTAIN A

DISCIPLINED FRAMEWORK OF INTERNAL CONTROLS AND APPLY A CONTROLS MANAGEMENT SYSTEM FOR MONITORING COMPLIANCE WITH THIS FRAMEWORK. SUBSTANTIAL LIABILITIES AND OTHER ADVERSE IMPACTS COULD RESULT IF OUR MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS AND CONTROLS DO NOT FUNCTION AS

INTENDED.

PREPAREDNESS.

OUR OPERATIONS MAY BE DISRUPTED BY SEVERE WEATHER EVENTS, NATURAL DISASTERS, AND SIMILAR EVENTS. FOR EXAMPLE, HURRICANES MAY DAMAGE OUR OFFSHORE PRODUCTION FACILITIES OR COASTAL REFINING

AND PETROCHEMICAL PLANTS IN VULNERABLE AREAS. OUR ABILITY TO MITIGATE THE ADVERSE IMPACTS OF THESE EVENTS DEPENDS IN PART UPON THE EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR RIGOROUS DISASTER PREPAREDNESS AND BUSINESS CONTINUITY PLANNING.

PROJECTIONS, ESTIMATES AND DESCRIPTIONS OF EXXONMOBILS

PLANS AND OBJECTIVES INCLUDED OR INCORPORATED IN ITEMS 1, 1A, 2, 7 AND 7A OF THIS REPORT ARE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS. ACTUAL FUTURE RESULTS, INCLUDING PROJECT COMPLETION DATES, PRODUCTION RATES, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, COSTS AND BUSINESS PLANS

TABLE OF CONTENTS

INDEX TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

IN THE PRECEDING RESERVES INFORMATION, CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARY AND EQUITY COMPANY RESERVES

ARE REPORTED SEPARATELY. HOWEVER, THE CORPORATION OPERATES ITS BUSINESS WITH THE SAME VIEW OF EQUITY COMPANY RESERVES AS IT HAS FOR RESERVES FROM CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES.

THE CORPORATIONS OVERALL VOLUME CAPACITY OUTLOOK, BASED ON PROJECTS COMING ON STREAM AS ANTICIPATED, IS

FOR PRODUCTION CAPACITY TO GROW OVER THE PERIOD 2010-2014. HOWEVER, ACTUAL VOLUMES WILL VARY FROM YEAR TO YEAR DUE TO THE TIMING OF INDIVIDUAL PROJECT START-UPS, OPERATIONAL OUTAGES, RESERVOIR PERFORMANCE, REGULATORY CHANGES, ASSET SALES, WEATHER

EVENTS, PRICE EFFECTS ON PRODUCTION SHARING CONTRACTS AND OTHER FACTORS AS DESCRIBED IN ITEM 1ARISK FACTORS OF THIS REPORT.

THE ESTIMATION OF PROVED RESERVES, WHICH IS BASED ON THE REQUIREMENT OF REASONABLE CERTAINTY, IS AN ONGOING PROCESS BASED ON RIGOROUS

TECHNICAL EVALUATIONS, COMMERCIAL AND MARKET ASSESSMENTS AND DETAILED ANALYSIS OF WELL INFORMATION SUCH AS FLOW RATES AND RESERVOIR PRESSURE DECLINES. FURTHERMORE, THE CORPORATION ONLY RECORDS PROVED RESERVES FOR PROJECTS WHICH HAVE RECEIVED

SIGNIFICANT FUNDING COMMITMENTS BY MANAGEMENT MADE TOWARD THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE RESERVES. ALTHOUGH THE CORPORATION IS REASONABLY CERTAIN THAT PROVED RESERVES WILL BE PRODUCED, THE TIMING AND AMOUNT RECOVERED CAN BE AFFECTED BY A NUMBER OF FACTORS

INCLUDING COMPLETION OF DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS, RESERVOIR PERFORMANCE, REGULATORY APPROVALS AND SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN PROJECTIONS OF LONG-TERM OIL AND GAS PRICE LEVELS.

B. TECHNOLOGIES USED IN ESTABLISHING PROVED RESERVES ADDITIONS IN 2009

ADDITIONS TO EXXONMOBILS PROVED RESERVES IN 2009 WERE

BASED ON ESTIMATES GENERATED THROUGH THE INTEGRATION OF AVAILABLE AND APPROPRIATE DATA, UTILIZING WELL ESTABLISHED TECHNOLOGIES THAT HAVE BEEN DEMONSTRATED IN THE FIELD TO YIELD REPEATABLE AND CONSISTENT RESULTS.

DATA USED IN THESE INTEGRATED ASSESSMENTS INCLUDED INFORMATION

OBTAINED DIRECTLY FROM THE SUBSURFACE VIA WELLBORES, SUCH AS WELL LOGS, RESERVOIR CORE SAMPLES, FLUID SAMPLES, STATIC AND DYNAMIC PRESSURE INFORMATION, PRODUCTION TEST DATA, AND SURVEILLANCE AND PERFORMANCE INFORMATION. THE DATA UTILIZED ALSO

INCLUDED SUBSURFACE INFORMATION OBTAINED THROUGH INDIRECT MEASUREMENTS INCLUDING HIGH-QUALITY 2-D AND 3-D SEISMIC DATA, CALIBRATED WITH AVAILABLE WELL CONTROL. WHERE APPLICABLE, SURFACE GEOLOGICAL INFORMATION WAS ALSO UTILIZED. THE TOOLS USED TO

INTERPRET THE DATA INCLUDED PROPRIETARY SEISMIC PROCESSING SOFTWARE, PROPRIETARY RESERVOIR MODELING AND SIMULATION SOFTWARE AND COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE DATA ANALYSIS PACKAGES.

IN SOME CIRCUMSTANCES, WHERE APPROPRIATE ANALOG RESERVOIRS WERE AVAILABLE, RESERVOIR PARAMETERS FROM THESE

ANALOGS WERE USED TO INCREASE THE QUALITY OF AND CONFIDENCE IN THE RESERVES ESTIMATES.

C. QUALIFICATIONS OF RESERVES TECHNICAL OVERSIGHT GROUP AND INTERNAL CONTROLS OVER PROVED RESERVES

EXXONMOBIL HAS A DEDICATED RESERVES TECHNICAL OVERSIGHT GROUP

THAT IS SEPARATE FROM THE OPERATING ORGANIZATION. PRIMARY RESPONSIBILITIES OF THIS GROUP INCLUDE OVERSIGHT OF THE RESERVES ESTIMATION PROCESS FOR COMPLIANCE WITH SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (SEC) RULES AND REGULATIONS, REVIEW OF ANNUAL

CHANGES IN RESERVES ESTIMATES, AND THE REPORTING OF EXXONMOBILS PROVED RESERVES. THIS GROUP ALSO MAINTAINS THE OFFICIAL COMPANY RESERVES ESTIMATES FOR EXXONMOBILS PROVED RESERVES OF CRUDE AND NATURAL GAS LIQUIDS, BITUMEN, SYNTHETIC OIL

AND NATURAL GAS. IN ADDITION, THE GROUP PROVIDES TRAINING TO PERSONNEL INVOLVED IN THE RESERVES ESTIMATION AND REPORTING PROCESS WITHIN EXXONMOBIL AND ITS AFFILIATES. THE GROUP IS MANAGED BY AND STAFFED WITH INDIVIDUALS THAT HAVE AN AVERAGE OF MORE

THAN 20 YEARS OF TECHNICAL EXPERIENCE IN THE PETROLEUM INDUSTRY, INCLUDING EXPERTISE IN THE CLASSIFICATION AND CATEGORIZATION OF RESERVES UNDER THE SEC GUIDELINES. THIS GROUP INCLUDES SEVERAL INDIVIDUALS WHO HOLD ADVANCED DEGREES IN EITHER

ENGINEERING OR GEOLOGY, AS WELL AS INDIVIDUALS WHO HOLD BACHELORS DEGREES IN VARIOUS TECHNICAL DISCIPLINES. SEVERAL MEMBERS OF THE GROUP HOLD PROFESSIONAL REGISTRATIONS IN THEIR FIELD OF EXPERTISE AND SEVERAL HAVE SERVED ON THE OIL AND GAS

RESERVES COMMITTEE OF THE SOCIETY OF PETROLEUM ENGINEERS.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

INDEX TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

THE RESERVES TECHNICAL OVERSIGHT GROUP MAINTAINS A CENTRAL COMPUTERIZED DATABASE CONTAINING

THE OFFICIAL COMPANY GLOBAL RESERVES ESTIMATES AND PRODUCTION DATA. APPROPRIATE CONTROLS, INCLUDING LIMITATIONS ON DATABASE ACCESS AND UPDATE CAPABILITIES, ARE IN PLACE TO ENSURE DATA INTEGRITY WITHIN THIS CENTRAL COMPUTERIZED DATABASE. AN ANNUAL

REVIEW OF THE SYSTEMS CONTROLS IS PERFORMED BY INTERNAL AUDIT. KEY COMPONENTS OF THE RESERVES ESTIMATION PROCESS INCLUDE TECHNICAL EVALUATIONS AND ANALYSIS OF WELL AND FIELD PERFORMANCE AND A RIGOROUS PEER REVIEW. NO CHANGES MAY BE MADE TO THE

RESERVES ESTIMATES IN THE CENTRAL DATABASE, INCLUDING ADDITIONS OF ANY NEW INITIAL RESERVES ESTIMATES OR SUBSEQUENT REVISIONS, UNLESS THESE CHANGES HAVE BEEN THOROUGHLY REVIEWED AND EVALUATED BY DULY AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL WITHIN THE OPERATING

ORGANIZATION. IN ADDITION, CHANGES TO RESERVES ESTIMATES THAT EXCEED CERTAIN THRESHOLDS REQUIRE FURTHER REVIEW AND APPROVAL OF THE APPROPRIATE LEVEL OF MANAGEMENT WITHIN THE OPERATING ORGANIZATION BEFORE THE CHANGES MAY BE MADE IN THE CENTRAL

DATABASE. ENDORSEMENT BY THE RESERVES TECHNICAL OVERSIGHT GROUP FOR ALL PROVED RESERVES CHANGES IS A MANDATORY COMPONENT OF THIS REVIEW PROCESS. AFTER ALL CHANGES ARE MADE, REVIEWS ARE HELD WITH SENIOR MANAGEMENT FOR FINAL ENDORSEMENT.

2.    PROVED UNDEVELOPED RESERVES

AT YEAR-END 2009, APPROXIMATELY 7.5 BILLION OIL-EQUIVALENT

BARRELS (GOEB) OF EXXONMOBILS PROVED RESERVES WERE CLASSIFIED AS PROVED UNDEVELOPED, WHICH REPRESENTED 33 PERCENT OF THE 23.0 GOEB REPORTED IN PROVED RESERVES. THIS COMPARES TO 38 PERCENT PROVED UNDEVELOPED REPORTED AT THE END OF 2008. THE NET

REDUCTION FROM 2008 IS REFLECTIVE OF OUR ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS ON MANY PROJECTS WORLDWIDE. THIS PERCENTAGE IS INCLUSIVE OF BOTH CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES AND EQUITY COMPANY RESERVES. SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS WAS MADE IN CONVERTING PROVED

UNDEVELOPED RESERVES INTO PROVED DEVELOPED RESERVES IN 2009. DURING THE YEAR, EXXONMOBIL COMPLETED DEVELOPMENT WORK IN OVER 100 FIELDS AND PARTICIPATED IN NUMEROUS MAJOR PROJECT START-UPS THAT RESULTED IN THE TRANSFER OF APPROXIMATELY 2.4 GOEB FROM

PROVED UNDEVELOPED TO PROVED DEVELOPED RESERVES BY YEAR-END. THIS REPRESENTED THE MOVEMENT OF 28 PERCENT OF THE PROVED UNDEVELOPED RESERVES INTO THE PROVED DEVELOPED CATEGORY OR AN AVERAGE TURNOVER TIME OF ABOUT FOUR YEARS. THE LARGEST

TRANSFERS WERE ASSOCIATED WITH TWO LIQUEFIED NATURAL GAS (LNG) TRAINS AND THE SECOND PHASE OF A DOMESTIC GAS SUPPLY PROJECT IN QATAR.

ONE OF EXXONMOBILS REQUIREMENTS FOR REPORTING PROVED RESERVES IS THAT MANAGEMENT HAS MADE SIGNIFICANT FUNDING COMMITMENTS TOWARD THE

DEVELOPMENT OF THE RESERVES. EXXONMOBIL HAS A DISCIPLINED INVESTMENT STRATEGY AND MANY MAJOR FIELDS REQUIRE A LONG LEAD-TIME IN ORDER TO BE DEVELOPED. DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS TYPICALLY TAKE TWO TO FOUR YEARS FROM THE TIME OF FIRST RECORDING OF PROVED

RESERVES TO THE START OF PRODUCTION OF THESE RESERVES. HOWEVER, THE DEVELOPMENT TIME FOR LARGE AND COMPLEX PROJECTS CAN EXCEED FIVE YEARS. DURING 2009, NEW APPROVED PROJECTS ADDED APPROXIMATELY 1.3 GOEB OF PROVED UNDEVELOPED RESERVES. THE LARGEST OF

THESE WERE THE GORGON LNG PROJECT IN AUSTRALIA AND THE PAPUA NEW GUINEA LNG PROJECT. OVERALL, INVESTMENTS OF $12.7 BILLION WERE MADE BY THE CORPORATION DURING 2009 TO PROGRESS THE DEVELOPMENT OF REPORTED PROVED UNDEVELOPED RESERVES, INCLUDING $11.6

BILLION FOR OIL AND GAS PRODUCING ACTIVITIES AND AN ADDITIONAL $1.1 BILLION FOR OTHER NON-OIL AND GAS PRODUCING ACTIVITIES SUCH AS THE CONSTRUCTION OF LNG TRAINS, TANKERS AND REGASIFICATION FACILITIES THAT WERE UNDERTAKEN TO PROGRESS THE DEVELOPMENT

OF PROVED UNDEVELOPED RESERVES. THESE INVESTMENTS REPRESENTED 61 PERCENT OF THE $20.7 BILLION IN TOTAL REPORTED UPSTREAM CAPITAL AND EXPLORATION EXPENDITURES.

PROVED UNDEVELOPED RESERVES IN THE UNITED STATES, KAZAKHSTAN, QATAR, NIGERIA, NETHERLANDS AND CANADA HAVE REMAINED UNDEVELOPED FOR FIVE

YEARS OR MORE PRIMARILY DUE TO CONSTRAINTS ON THE CAPACITY OF INFRASTRUCTURE AND THE PACE OF CO-VENTURERS/GOVERNMENT FUNDING, AS WELL AS THE TIME REQUIRED TO DEVELOP AND COMPLETE THE PROJECTS. THE CORPORATION IS REASONABLY CERTAIN THAT THESE PROVED

RESERVES WILL BE PRODUCED; HOWEVER, THE TIMING AND AMOUNT RECOVERED CAN BE AFFECTED BY A NUMBER OF FACTORS INCLUDING COMPLETION OF DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS, RESERVOIR PERFORMANCE AND REGULATORY APPROVALS. THE TWO LARGEST PROJECTS THAT HAVE BEEN REPORTED

WITH PROVED UNDEVELOPED RESERVES FOR FIVE OR MORE YEARS

ARE IN QATAR AND KAZAKHSTAN. IN QATAR, THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE RAS LAFFAN 3 TRAIN 7 LNG LIQUEFACTION TRAIN IS NOW COMPLETE. IN KAZAKHSTAN, EXXONMOBIL PARTICIPATES IN THE NORTH CASPIAN PRODUCTION

SHARING AGREEMENT, WHICH INCLUDES THE GIANT KASHAGAN FIELD LOCATED OFFSHORE IN THE CASPIAN SEA. PHASE 1 OF THE KASHAGAN FIELD IS CURRENTLY UNDER CONSTRUCTION AND INCLUDES AN OFFSHORE PRODUCTION AND SEPARATION HUB ON AN ARTIFICIAL ISLAND, SEVERAL

DRILLING ISLANDS, THREE ONSHORE OIL-STABILIZATION TRAINS, TWO ONSHORE GAS TREATMENT PLANTS AND AN ONSHORE SULFUR TREATMENT PLANT. EXXONMOBIL ALSO PARTICIPATES IN THE TENGIZCHEVROIL JOINT VENTURE IN KAZAKHSTAN WHICH INCLUDES A PRODUCTION LICENSE IN

THE TENGIZ FIELD, AND THE NEARBY KOROLEV FIELD. THE JOINT VENTURE IS PRODUCING AND PROVED UNDEVELOPED RESERVES WILL CONTINUE TO MOVE TO PROVED DEVELOPED AS APPROVED DEVELOPMENT PHASES PROGRESS.

RESOURCES EXTRACTED BY MINING TECHNOLOGIES

SYNCRUDE OPERATIONS

SYNCRUDE IS A JOINT VENTURE ESTABLISHED TO RECOVER SHALLOW DEPOSITS OF OIL SANDS USING OPEN-PIT MINING METHODS TO EXTRACT THE CRUDE BITUMEN, AND THEN UPGRADE IT TO PRODUCE A HIGH-QUALITY, LIGHT (32 DEGREES API), SWEET, SYNTHETIC CRUDE OIL.

IMPERIAL OIL LIMITED IS THE OWNER OF A 25 PERCENT INTEREST IN THE JOINT VENTURE. EXXON MOBIL CORPORATION HAS A 69.6 PERCENT INTEREST IN IMPERIAL OIL LIMITED. THE SYNCRUDE OPERATION, LOCATED NEAR FORT MCMURRAY, ALBERTA, CANADA, MINES A PORTION OF THE

ATHABASCA OIL SANDS DEPOSIT. SYNCRUDE JOINT VENTURE OWNERS HOLD EIGHT OIL SANDS LEASES COVERING ABOUT 250,000 ACRES IN THE ATHABASCA OIL SANDS DEPOSIT. SINCE STARTUP IN 1978, SYNCRUDE HAS PRODUCED ABOUT 2.0 BILLION BARRELS OF SYNTHETIC CRUDE OIL.

THE PRODUCED SYNTHETIC CRUDE OIL IS SHIPPED FROM THE SYNCRUDE SITE TO EDMONTON, ALBERTA, BY ALBERTA OIL SANDS PIPELINE LTD. IN 2009, SYNCRUDES NET PRODUCTION OF SYNTHETIC CRUDE OIL WAS ABOUT 259,000 BARRELS PER DAY AND GROSS PRODUCTION WAS

ABOUT 280,000 BARRELS PER DAY. THE COMPANYS SHARE OF NET PRODUCTION IN 2009 WAS ABOUT 65,000 BARRELS PER DAY. THERE ARE NO APPROVED PLANS FOR MAJOR FUTURE EXPANSION PROJECTS.

KEARL PROJECT

THE KEARL OIL SANDS PROJECT IS A JOINT VENTURE ESTABLISHED TO RECOVER SHALLOW DEPOSITS OF OIL SANDS USING

OPEN-PIT MINING METHODS TO EXTRACT THE CRUDE BITUMEN. IMPERIAL OIL LIMITED HOLDS A 70.96 PERCENT INTEREST IN THE JOINT VENTURE AND EXXONMOBIL CANADA PROPERTIES HOLDS THE OTHER 29.04 PERCENT. EXXON MOBIL CORPORATION HAS A 69.6 PERCENT INTEREST IN

IMPERIAL OIL LIMITED AND A 100 PERCENT INTEREST IN EXXONMOBIL CANADA PROPERTIES. THE KEARL PROJECT IS LOCATED APPROXIMATELY 40 MILES NORTH OF FORT MCMURRAY, ALBERTA, CANADA.

KEARL IS EXPECTED TO BE DEVELOPED IN PHASES. BITUMEN WILL BE EXTRACTED FROM OIL SANDS PRODUCED FROM OPEN-PIT

MINING OPERATIONS, AND PROCESSED THROUGH A BITUMEN EXTRACTION AND FROTH TREATMENT PLANT. THE PRODUCT, A BLEND OF BITUMEN AND DILUENT, IS PLANNED TO BE SHIPPED VIA PIPELINES FOR DISTRIBUTION TO NORTH AMERICAN MARKETS. DILUENT IS NATURAL GAS

CONDENSATE OR OTHER LIGHT HYDROCARBONS ADDED TO THE CRUDE BITUMEN TO FACILITATE TRANSPORTATION TO MARKET BY PIPELINE.

THE KEARL PROJECT RECEIVED APPROVALS FROM THE PROVINCE OF ALBERTA IN 2007 AND THE GOVERNMENT OF CANADA IN 2008. THE PROVINCE OF ALBERTA

ISSUED AN OPERATING AND CONSTRUCTION LICENSE IN 2008, WHICH PERMITS THE PROJECT TO MINE OIL SANDS AND PRODUCE BITUMEN FROM APPROVED DEVELOPMENT AREAS ON OIL SANDS LEASES. KEARL IS COMPRISED OF SIX OIL SANDS LEASES COVERING ABOUT 48,000 ACRES IN THE

ATHABASCA OIL SANDS DEPOSIT.

PRODUCTION FROM THE

FIRST PHASE IS EXPECTED TO BE AT AN INITIAL RATE OF APPROXIMATELY 110,000 GROSS BARRELS OF BITUMEN A DAY. ABOUT $2 BILLION HAS BEEN SPENT ON THE PROJECT THROUGH 2009. IN 2009, PIPELINE TRANSPORTATION AGREEMENTS WERE CONCLUDED, INFRASTRUCTURE

CONSTRUCTION CONTINUED AND MORE THAN HALF OF THE DETAILED ENGINEERING WAS COMPLETED.

REVISED TO INCLUDE OIL SANDS MINING ACREAGE.

EXXONMOBILS INVESTMENT IN DEVELOPED AND UNDEVELOPED ACREAGE IS COMPRISED OF NUMEROUS CONCESSIONS, BLOCKS AND LEASES. THE TERMS AND

CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH THE CORPORATION MAINTAINS EXPLORATION AND/OR PRODUCTION RIGHTS TO THE ACREAGE ARE PROPERTY-SPECIFIC, CONTRACTUALLY DEFINED AND VARY SIGNIFICANTLY FROM PROPERTY TO PROPERTY. WORK PROGRAMS ARE DESIGNED TO ENSURE THAT THE

EXPLORATION POTENTIAL OF ANY PROPERTY IS FULLY EVALUATED BEFORE EXPIRATION. IN SOME INSTANCES, THE CORPORATION MAY ELECT TO RELINQUISH ACREAGE IN ADVANCE OF THE CONTRACTUAL EXPIRATION DATE IF THE EVALUATION PROCESS IS COMPLETE AND THERE IS NOT A

BUSINESS BASIS FOR EXTENSION. IN CASES WHERE ADDITIONAL TIME MAY BE REQUIRED TO FULLY EVALUATE ACREAGE, THE CORPORATION HAS GENERALLY BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN OBTAINING EXTENSIONS.

D. SUMMARY OF ACREAGE TERMS

UNITED STATES

OIL AND GAS LEASES HAVE AN EXPLORATION PERIOD RANGING FROM ONE TO TEN YEARS, AND A PRODUCTION PERIOD THAT NORMALLY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL

PRODUCTION CEASES. UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES, A LEASE MAY BE HELD BEYOND ITS EXPLORATION TERM EVEN IF PRODUCTION HAS NOT COMMENCED. IN SOME INSTANCES, A FEE INTEREST IS ACQUIRED WHERE BOTH THE SURFACE AND THE UNDERLYING MINERAL

INTERESTS ARE OWNED OUTRIGHT.

CANADA / SOUTH AMERICA

CANADA

EXPLORATION PERMITS ARE GRANTED FOR VARYING PERIODS OF TIME

WITH RENEWALS POSSIBLE. EXPLORATION RIGHTS IN ONSHORE AREAS ACQUIRED FROM CANADIAN PROVINCES ENTITLE THE HOLDER TO OBTAIN LEASES UPON COMPLETING SPECIFIED WORK. PRODUCTION LEASES ARE HELD AS LONG AS THERE IS PRODUCTION ON THE LEASE. THE MAJORITY OF

COLD LAKE LEASES WERE TAKEN FOR AN INITIAL 21-YEAR TERM IN 1968-1969 AND RENEWED FOR A SECOND 21-YEAR TERM IN 1989-1990. THE EXPLORATION ACREAGE IN EASTERN CANADA AND THE BLOCK IN THE BEAUFORT SEA ACQUIRED IN 2007 ARE CURRENTLY HELD BY WORK

COMMITMENTS OF VARIOUS AMOUNTS.

EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION ACTIVITIES IN THE DEEPWATER OFFSHORE

AREAS ARE TYPICALLY GOVERNED BY PRODUCTION SHARING CONTRACTS (PSCS) WITH THE NATIONAL OIL COMPANY, THE NIGERIAN NATIONAL PETROLEUM CORPORATION (NNPC). NNPC HOLDS THE UNDERLYING OIL PROSPECTING LICENSE (OPL) AND ANY RESULTING OIL MINING LEASE (OML).

THE TERMS OF THE PSCS ARE GENERALLY 30 YEARS, INCLUDING A TEN-YEAR EXPLORATION PERIOD (AN INITIAL EXPLORATION PHASE PLUS ONE OR TWO OPTIONAL PERIODS) COVERED BY AN OPL. UPON COMMERCIAL DISCOVERY, AN OPL MAY BE CONVERTED TO AN OML. PARTIAL

RELINQUISHMENT IS REQUIRED UNDER THE PSC AT THE END OF THE TEN-YEAR EXPLORATION PERIOD, AND OMLS HAVE A 20-YEAR PRODUCTION PERIOD THAT MAY BE EXTENDED.

SOME EXPLORATION ACTIVITIES ARE CARRIED OUT IN DEEPWATER BY JOINT VENTURES WITH LOCAL COMPANIES HOLDING INTERESTS IN AN OPL. OPLS IN

DEEPWATER OFFSHORE AREAS ARE VALID FOR TEN YEARS AND ARE NON-

RENEWABLE, WHILE IN ALL OTHER AREAS THE LICENSES ARE FOR FIVE YEARS AND ALSO ARE NON-RENEWABLE. DEMONSTRATING A COMMERCIAL DISCOVERY IS THE BASIS FOR CONVERSION OF AN OPL TO AN OML.

OMLS GRANTED PRIOR TO THE 1969 PETROLEUM ACT (I.E., UNDER THE

MINERAL OILS ACT 1914, REPEALED BY THE 1969 PETROLEUM ACT) WERE FOR 30 YEARS ONSHORE AND 40 YEARS IN OFFSHORE AREAS AND HAVE BEEN RENEWED, EFFECTIVE DECEMBER 1, 2008, FOR A FURTHER PERIOD OF 20 YEARS, WITH A FURTHER RENEWAL OPTION OF 20 YEARS.

OPERATIONS UNDER THESE PRE-1969 OMLS ARE CONDUCTED UNDER A JOINT VENTURE AGREEMENT WITH NNPC RATHER THAN A PSC. IN 2000, A MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING (MOU) WAS EXECUTED DEFINING COMMERCIAL TERMS APPLICABLE TO EXISTING JOINT VENTURE OIL PRODUCTION.

THE MOU MAY BE TERMINATED ON ONE CALENDAR YEARS NOTICE.

OMLS GRANTED UNDER THE 1969 PETROLEUM ACT, WHICH INCLUDE ALL DEEPWATER OMLS, HAVE A MAXIMUM TERM OF 20 YEARS WITHOUT DISTINCTION FOR ONSHORE OR OFFSHORE LOCATION AND ARE RENEWABLE, UPON 12 MONTHS

WRITTEN NOTICE, FOR ANOTHER PERIOD OF 20 YEARS. OMLS NOT HELD BY NNPC ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO A MANDATORY 50-PERCENT RELINQUISHMENT AFTER THE FIRST TEN YEARS OF THEIR DURATION.

MINIMUM WORK AND SPENDING COMMITMENTS, INCLUDING AN ENHANCED OIL RECOVERY PROJECT IN ONE OF THE OIL FIELDS. WHEN THE EXISTING PSC EXPIRES ON MARCH 31, 2012, THE PRODUCING FIELDS COVERED BY THE EXISTING PSC WILL AUTOMATICALLY BECOME PART OF THE NEW

PSC, WHICH HAS A 25-YEAR DURATION FROM APRIL 2008.

AS INDICATED IN THE CERTIFICATIONS IN

EXHIBIT 31 OF THIS REPORT, THE CORPORATIONS CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, PRINCIPAL FINANCIAL OFFICER AND PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING OFFICER HAVE EVALUATED THE CORPORATIONS DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2009. BASED ON THAT

EVALUATION, THESE OFFICERS HAVE CONCLUDED THAT THE CORPORATIONS DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES ARE EFFECTIVE IN ENSURING THAT INFORMATION REQUIRED TO BE DISCLOSED BY THE CORPORATION IN THE REPORTS THAT IT FILES OR SUBMITS UNDER THE

SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934, AS AMENDED, IS ACCUMULATED AND COMMUNICATED TO THEM IN A MANNER THAT ALLOWS FOR TIMELY DECISIONS REGARDING REQUIRED DISCLOSURES AND ARE EFFECTIVE IN ENSURING THAT SUCH INFORMATION IS RECORDED, PROCESSED, SUMMARIZED

AND REPORTED WITHIN THE TIME PERIODS SPECIFIED IN THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSIONS RULES AND FORMS.

MANAGEMENTS REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

MANAGEMENT, INCLUDING THE CORPORATIONS CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, PRINCIPAL FINANCIAL OFFICER AND PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING

OFFICER, IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ESTABLISHING AND MAINTAINING ADEQUATE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER THE CORPORATIONS FINANCIAL REPORTING. MANAGEMENT CONDUCTED AN EVALUATION OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING BASED ON

CRITERIA ESTABLISHED IN INTERNAL CONTROL - INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK ISSUED BY THE COMMITTEE OF SPONSORING ORGANIZATIONS OF THE TREADWAY COMMISSION. BASED ON THIS EVALUATION, MANAGEMENT CONCLUDED THAT EXXON MOBIL CORPORATIONS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER

FINANCIAL REPORTING WAS EFFECTIVE AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2009.

PRICEWATERHOUSECOOPERS LLP, AN INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM, AUDITED THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE CORPORATIONS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2009, AS STATED IN THEIR REPORT INCLUDED IN

THE FINANCIAL SECTION OF THIS REPORT.

DIRECTORS, EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AND CORPORATE GOVERNANCE.

REFERENCE IS MADE TO THE FOLLOWING IN THE PROXY

INFORMATION SECTION OF THIS REPORT.



THE SECTION ENTITLED DIRECTOR INFORMATION;



THE PORTION ENTITLED SECTION 16(A) BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP REPORTING COMPLIANCE OF THE SECTION ENTITLED DIRECTOR AND EXECUTIVE

OFFICER STOCK OWNERSHIP; AND



THE PORTIONS ENTITLED DIRECTOR QUALIFICATIONS AND CODE OF ETHICS AND BUSINESS CONDUCT OF THE SECTION ENTITLED CORPORATE

GOVERNANCE.

THE BOARD HAS

APPOINTED AN AUDIT COMMITTEE. THE MEMBERS OF THE AUDIT COMMITTEE ARE: M. J. BOSKIN, L. R. FAULKNER AND S. S REINEMUND. THE BOARD HAS DETERMINED THAT ALL MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE ARE FINANCIALLY LITERATE WITHIN THE MEANING OF THE

NYSE STANDARDS, AND THAT ALL ARE AUDIT COMMITTEE FINANCIAL EXPERTS AS DEFINED IN THE SEC RULES.

THE PROCEDURES BY WHICH SHAREHOLDERS MAY RECOMMEND NOMINEES FOR CONSIDERATION BY THE BOARD AFFAIRS COMMITTEE AS DIRECTOR NOMINEES HAVE NOT

CHANGED MATERIALLY SINCE LAST YEAR.

ITEM 11.

EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION.

REFERENCE IS MADE TO THE SECTIONS ENTITLED DIRECTOR COMPENSATION, COMPENSATION COMMITTEE REPORT, COMPENSATION

DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS AND EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION TABLES OF THE PROXY INFORMATION SECTION OF THIS REPORT.

THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE DETERMINES WHETHER EXXONMOBILS COMPENSATION POLICIES AND PRACTICES COULD RESULT IN INAPPROPRIATE

RISK-TAKING. BASED ON ITS ASSESSMENT, THE COMMITTEE DOES NOT BELIEVE THAT EXXONMOBILS COMPENSATION POLICIES AND PRACTICES CREATE ANY MATERIAL ADVERSE RISKS FOR THE COMPANY FOR THE FOLLOWING REASONS.

INAPPROPRIATE RISK-TAKING IS DISCOURAGED BY REQUIRING SENIOR

EXECUTIVES TO HOLD A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF THEIR EQUITY INCENTIVE AWARD FOR THEIR ENTIRE CAREER AND BEYOND RETIREMENT. THESE LENGTHY HOLDING PERIODS ARE TAILORED TO OUR BUSINESS MODEL. THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE REQUIRES THAT THESE EQUITY GRANTS

WITH LONG HOLDING PERIODS COMPRISE 50 TO 70 PERCENT OF TOTAL COMPENSATION FOR NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AS DEPICTED ON PAGE 133 OF THE COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS, WHEREAS THE ANNUAL BONUS AWARD WAS ONLY ABOUT 10 PERCENT OF TOTAL

ANNUAL COMPENSATION IN 2009.

PAYOUT OF 50 PERCENT

OF THE ANNUAL BONUS IS DELAYED AND SUBJECT TO RISK OF FORFEITURE, WHICH IS A UNIQUE FEATURE OF THE ANNUAL BONUS PROGRAM RELATIVE TO MANY COMPARATOR COMPANIES AND FURTHER DISCOURAGES INAPPROPRIATE RISK-TAKING; THE TIMING OF THE DELAYED PAYOUT IS

DETERMINED BY EARNINGS PERFORMANCE.

EXECUTIVES

BELOW THE NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS PARTICIPATE IN THE SAME PLANS WHICH ARE ALSO REVIEWED BY THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE; THEREFORE, INAPPROPRIATE RISK-TAKING IS DISCOURAGED AT ALL LEVELS OF THE COMPANY THROUGH SIMILAR COMPENSATION DESIGN FEATURES AND

ALLOCATION OF AWARDS.

FINALLY, IT SHOULD ALSO BE

NOTED THAT A LARGE PERCENTAGE OF CAREER COMPENSATION FOR ALL EXECUTIVES AND EMPLOYEES IS IN THE FORM OF A DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION WHICH REQUIRES MANY YEARS OF DEDICATED SERVICE TO THE COMPANY TO HAVE MATERIAL VALUE AND IS BASED ON A STANDARD

RETIREMENT AGE OF 65, WITH EARLY RETIREMENT ELIGIBILITY AT AGE 55 WITH A MINIMUM OF 15 YEARS OF SERVICE. THIS IS ANOTHER DIMENSION OF TOTAL COMPENSATION THAT DISCOURAGES INAPPROPRIATE RISK-TAKING; INSTEAD, IT ENCOURAGES EXECUTIVES TO TAKE A

LONG-TERM VIEW WHEN MAKING BUSINESS DECISIONS AND TO FOCUS ON ACHIEVING SUSTAINABLE GROWTH FOR SHAREHOLDERS.

COMMITTEE. PRE-APPROVALS APPLY TO ENGAGEMENTS WITHIN A CATEGORY OF SERVICE, AND CANNOT BE TRANSFERRED BETWEEN CATEGORIES. IF FEES MIGHT OTHERWISE EXCEED PRE-APPROVED AMOUNTS FOR ANY CATEGORY OF PERMISSIBLE SERVICES, THE INCREMENTAL AMOUNTS MUST BE

REVIEWED AND PRE-APPROVED PRIOR TO COMMITMENT. THE COMPLETE TEXT OF THE AUDIT COMMITTEES PRE-APPROVAL POLICIES AND PROCEDURES IS POSTED ON THE CORPORATE GOVERNANCE SECTION OF EXXONMOBILS WEBSITE.

FREQUENTLY USED TERMS

LISTED BELOW ARE DEFINITIONS OF SEVERAL OF EXXONMOBILS KEY BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE MEASURES. THESE DEFINITIONS ARE PROVIDED TO FACILITATE

UNDERSTANDING OF THE TERMS AND THEIR CALCULATION.

CASH FLOW FROM OPERATIONS AND ASSET SALES

CASH FLOW FROM OPERATIONS AND ASSET SALES IS THE SUM OF THE NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES AND PROCEEDS FROM SALES OF SUBSIDIARIES, INVESTMENTS

AND PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT FROM THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS. THIS CASH FLOW REFLECTS THE TOTAL SOURCES OF CASH FROM BOTH OPERATING THE CORPORATIONS ASSETS AND FROM THE DIVESTING OF ASSETS. THE CORPORATION EMPLOYS A

LONG-STANDING AND REGULAR DISCIPLINED REVIEW PROCESS TO ENSURE THAT ALL ASSETS ARE CONTRIBUTING TO THE CORPORATIONS STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES. ASSETS ARE DIVESTED WHEN THEY ARE NO LONGER MEETING THESE OBJECTIVES OR ARE WORTH CONSIDERABLY MORE TO

OTHERS. BECAUSE OF THE REGULAR NATURE OF THIS ACTIVITY, WE BELIEVE IT IS USEFUL FOR INVESTORS TO CONSIDER SALES PROCEEDS TOGETHER WITH CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES WHEN EVALUATING CASH AVAILABLE FOR INVESTMENT IN THE BUSINESS AND FINANCING

ACTIVITIES, INCLUDING SHAREHOLDER DISTRIBUTIONS.

CAPITAL EMPLOYED IN TOTAL FOR THE CORPORATION, IT INCLUDES EXXONMOBILS SHARE OF TOTAL DEBT AND EQUITY. BOTH OF THESE VIEWS INCLUDE EXXONMOBILS SHARE OF AMOUNTS APPLICABLE TO EQUITY COMPANIES, WHICH THE CORPORATION BELIEVES SHOULD BE

INCLUDED TO PROVIDE A MORE COMPREHENSIVE MEASURE OF CAPITAL EMPLOYED.

CAPITAL EMPLOYED (AVERAGE OF BEGINNING AND END-OF-YEAR AMOUNTS). THESE SEGMENT EARNINGS INCLUDE EXXONMOBILS SHARE OF SEGMENT EARNINGS OF EQUITY COMPANIES, CONSISTENT WITH OUR CAPITAL EMPLOYED DEFINITION, AND EXCLUDE THE COST OF FINANCING. THE

CORPORATIONS TOTAL ROCE IS NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO EXXONMOBIL EXCLUDING THE AFTER-TAX COST OF FINANCING, DIVIDED BY TOTAL CORPORATE AVERAGE CAPITAL EMPLOYED. THE CORPORATION HAS CONSISTENTLY APPLIED ITS ROCE DEFINITION FOR MANY YEARS AND

VIEWS IT AS THE BEST MEASURE OF HISTORICAL CAPITAL PRODUCTIVITY IN OUR CAPITAL-INTENSIVE, LONG-TERM INDUSTRY, BOTH TO EVALUATE MANAGEMENTS PERFORMANCE AND TO DEMONSTRATE TO SHAREHOLDERS THAT CAPITAL HAS BEEN USED WISELY OVER THE LONG TERM.

ADDITIONAL MEASURES, WHICH ARE MORE CASH FLOW-BASED, ARE USED TO MAKE INVESTMENT DECISIONS.

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

STATEMENTS IN THIS DISCUSSION REGARDING EXPECTATIONS, PLANS AND FUTURE EVENTS OR CONDITIONS ARE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS. ACTUAL FUTURE RESULTS, INCLUDING DEMAND GROWTH AND ENERGY SOURCE MIX;

CAPACITY INCREASES; PRODUCTION GROWTH AND MIX; RATES OF FIELD DECLINE; FINANCING SOURCES; THE RESOLUTION OF CONTINGENCIES AND UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS; ENVIRONMENTAL AND CAPITAL EXPENDITURES; AND BENEFITS REALIZED FROM THE XTO ENERGY TRANSACTION

COULD DIFFER MATERIALLY DEPENDING ON A NUMBER OF FACTORS, SUCH AS CHANGES IN THE SUPPLY OF AND DEMAND FOR CRUDE OIL, NATURAL GAS, AND PETROLEUM AND PETROCHEMICAL PRODUCTS; THE OUTCOME OF COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS; POLITICAL OR REGULATORY EVENTS,

INCLUDING THE TIMING AND CONDITIONS OF CLEARANCE FOR THE XTO ENERGY TRANSACTION; OUR ABILITY TO INTEGRATE XTO ENERGYS BUSINESS WITH OUR OWN; AND OTHER FACTORS DISCUSSED HEREIN AND IN ITEM 1A OF EXXONMOBILS 2009 FORM 10-K.

OVERVIEW

THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF EXXONMOBILS FINANCIAL RESULTS, AS WELL AS THE ACCOMPANYING FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND RELATED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS TO WHICH THEY REFER, ARE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE

MANAGEMENT OF EXXON MOBIL CORPORATION. THE CORPORATIONS ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL REPORTING FAIRLY REFLECT ITS STRAIGHTFORWARD BUSINESS MODEL INVOLVING THE EXTRACTING, MANUFACTURING AND MARKETING OF HYDROCARBONS AND HYDROCARBON-BASED PRODUCTS.

THE CORPORATIONS BUSINESS MODEL INVOLVES THE PRODUCTION (OR PURCHASE), MANUFACTURE AND SALE OF PHYSICAL PRODUCTS, AND ALL COMMERCIAL ACTIVITIES ARE DIRECTLY IN SUPPORT OF THE UNDERLYING PHYSICAL MOVEMENT OF GOODS. OUR CONSISTENT, CONSERVATIVE

APPROACH TO FINANCING THE CAPITAL-INTENSIVE NEEDS OF THE CORPORATION HAS HELPED EXXONMOBIL TO SUSTAIN THE TRIPLE-A STATUS OF ITS LONG-TERM DEBT SECURITIES FOR 91 YEARS.

EXXONMOBIL, WITH ITS RESOURCE BASE, FINANCIAL STRENGTH, DISCIPLINED INVESTMENT APPROACH AND TECHNOLOGY PORTFOLIO, IS WELL-POSITIONED TO

PARTICIPATE IN SUBSTANTIAL INVESTMENTS TO DEVELOP NEW ENERGY SUPPLIES. WHILE COMMODITY PRICES ARE VOLATILE ON A SHORT-TERM BASIS AND DEPEND ON SUPPLY AND DEMAND, EXXONMOBILS INVESTMENT DECISIONS ARE BASED ON OUR LONG-TERM BUSINESS OUTLOOK,

USING A DISCIPLINED APPROACH IN SELECTING AND PURSUING THE MOST ATTRACTIVE INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES. THE CORPORATE PLAN IS A FUNDAMENTAL ANNUAL MANAGEMENT PROCESS THAT IS THE BASIS FOR SETTING NEAR-TERM OPERATING AND CAPITAL OBJECTIVES IN ADDITION

TO PROVIDING THE LONGER-TERM ECONOMIC ASSUMPTIONS USED FOR INVESTMENT EVALUATION PURPOSES. VOLUMES ARE BASED ON INDIVIDUAL FIELD PRODUCTION PROFILES, WHICH ARE ALSO UPDATED ANNUALLY. PRICES FOR CRUDE OIL, NATURAL GAS AND REFINED PRODUCTS ARE BASED

ON CORPORATE PLAN ASSUMPTIONS DEVELOPED ANNUALLY BY MAJOR REGION AND ARE UTILIZED FOR INVESTMENT EVALUATION PURPOSES. POTENTIAL INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES ARE TESTED OVER A WIDE RANGE OF ECONOMIC SCENARIOS TO ESTABLISH THE RESILIENCY OF EACH

OPPORTUNITY. ONCE INVESTMENTS ARE MADE, A REAPPRAISAL PROCESS IS COMPLETED TO ENSURE RELEVANT LESSONS ARE LEARNED AND IMPROVEMENTS ARE INCORPORATED INTO FUTURE PROJECTS.

BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT AND RISK ASSESSMENT

LONG-TERM BUSINESS

OUTLOOK

BY 2030, THE WORLDS POPULATION IS PROJECTED TO GROW TO APPROXIMATELY 8 BILLION PEOPLE, OR ABOUT 1.5 BILLION MORE THAN IN

2005. COINCIDENT WITH THIS POPULATION INCREASE, THE CORPORATION EXPECTS WORLDWIDE ECONOMIC GROWTH TO AVERAGE 2.7 PERCENT PER YEAR. THIS COMBINATION OF POPULATION AND ECONOMIC GROWTH IS EXPECTED TO LEAD TO AN INCREASE IN PRIMARY ENERGY DEMAND OF

ALMOST 35 PERCENT BY 2030 VERSUS 2005 EVEN WITH SUBSTANTIAL EFFICIENCY GAINS. THIS DEMAND INCREASE IS EXPECTED TO BE CONCENTRATED IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES.

AS ECONOMIC PROGRESS DRIVES DEMAND HIGHER, THE USE OF MORE ENERGY-EFFICIENT, LOWER-EMISSION TECHNOLOGIES AND PRACTICES WILL BECOME INCREASINGLY IMPORTANT, LEADING TO A SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER LEVEL OF ENERGY

CONSUMPTION AND EMISSIONS PER UNIT OF ECONOMIC OUTPUT BY 2030. EFFICIENCY GAINS WILL RESULT FROM ANTICIPATED IMPROVEMENTS IN THE TRANSPORTATION AND POWER GENERATION SECTORS, DRIVEN BY THE INTRODUCTION OF NEW TECHNOLOGIES, AS WELL AS MANY OTHER

IMPROVEMENTS THAT SPAN THE RESIDENTIAL, COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL SECTORS.

ENERGY FOR TRANSPORTATION  INCLUDING CARS,

TRUCKS, SHIPS, TRAINS AND AIRPLANES  IS EXPECTED TO INCREASE BY OVER 35 PERCENT FROM 2005 TO 2030. THE GLOBAL GROWTH IN TRANSPORTATION DEMAND WILL BE MET PRIMARILY BY OIL, WHICH IS EXPECTED TO PROVIDE ALMOST 95 PERCENT OF ALL TRANSPORTATION

FUEL BY 2030, DOWN FROM ABOUT 98 PERCENT IN 2005, AS BIOFUELS AND NATURAL GAS GAIN MARKET SHARE.

DEMAND FOR ELECTRICITY

AROUND THE WORLD WILL GROW SIGNIFICANTLY THROUGH 2030. CONSISTENT WITH THIS PROJECTION, POWER GENERATION WILL REMAIN THE LARGEST AND FASTEST-GROWING MAJOR SEGMENT OF GLOBAL ENERGY DEMAND. MEETING THE EXPECTED GROWTH IN POWER DEMAND WILL REQUIRE A

DIVERSE SET OF ENERGY SOURCES. COAL WILL RETAIN THE LARGEST SHARE. HOWEVER, NATURAL GAS, NUCLEAR AND RENEWABLES ARE ALL EXPECTED TO GAIN MARKET SHARE.

LIQUID FUELS PROVIDE THE LARGEST SHARE OF ENERGY SUPPLY TODAY DUE TO THEIR AVAILABILITY, AFFORDABILITY AND EASE OF TRANSPORT. BY 2030, GLOBAL DEMAND FOR LIQUIDS IS EXPECTED TO GROW TO APPROXIMATELY

104 MILLION BARRELS OF OIL-EQUIVALENT PER DAY OR CLOSE TO 25 PERCENT MORE THAN IN 2005. GLOBAL DEMAND FOR LIQUID FUELS WILL BE MET BY A WIDE VARIETY OF SOURCES. CONVENTIONAL NON-OPEC CRUDE AND CONDENSATE PRODUCTION IS EXPECTED TO REMAIN

RELATIVELY FLAT THROUGH 2030. HOWEVER, GROWTH IS EXPECTED FROM A NUMBER OF SUPPLY SOURCES, INCLUDING BIOFUELS, OIL SANDS AND NATURAL GAS LIQUIDS, AS WELL AS CRUDE OIL FROM OPEC COUNTRIES. WHILE THE WORLDS RESOURCE BASE IS SUFFICIENT TO MEET

PROJECTED DEMAND, ACCESS TO RESOURCES AND TIMELY INVESTMENTS WILL REMAIN CRITICAL TO MEETING GLOBAL NEEDS WITH RELIABLE, AFFORDABLE SUPPLIES.

INCREASES IN NATURAL GAS DEMAND IN NORTH AMERICA, EUROPE AND ASIA PACIFIC WILL REQUIRE NEW SOURCES OF SUPPLY. HELPING MEET THESE NEEDS WILL BE ADDITIONAL LOCAL SUPPLIES OF UNCONVENTIONAL NATURAL GAS

 THE RESULT OF RECENT IMPROVEMENTS IN TECHNOLOGIES USED TO TAP THESE HARD-TO-PRODUCE RESOURCES  AS WELL AS IMPORTS. THE GROWING NEED FOR NATURAL GAS IMPORTS WILL HAVE A DRAMATIC IMPACT ON THE WORLDWIDE LIQUEFIED NATURAL GAS (LNG) MARKET,

WHICH IS EXPECTED TO APPROXIMATELY TRIPLE IN VOLUME FROM 2005 TO 2030.

THE WORLDS ENERGY MIX IS HIGHLY DIVERSE AND WILL

REMAIN SO THROUGH 2030. OIL IS EXPECTED TO REMAIN THE LARGEST SOURCE OF ENERGY SUPPLY AT CLOSE TO 35 PERCENT. FROM 2005 TO 2030, NATURAL GAS IS EXPECTED TO GROW THE FASTEST OF THE FOSSIL FUELS AND OVERTAKE COAL AS THE SECOND-LARGEST ENERGY SOURCE.

NUCLEAR POWER IS PROJECTED TO GROW SIGNIFICANTLY, SURPASSING COAL IN TERMS OF ABSOLUTE GROWTH AND REACHING THE LEVEL OF BIOMASS AS THE FOURTH-LARGEST SOURCE OF ENERGY. HYDRO AND GEOTHERMAL WILL ALSO GROW, THOUGH REMAIN LIMITED BY THE AVAILABILITY OF

NATURAL SITES. WIND, SOLAR AND BIOFUELS ARE EXPECTED TO GROW AT CLOSE TO 10 PERCENT PER YEAR ON AVERAGE, THE HIGHEST GROWTH RATE OF ALL FUELS, AND ARE PROJECTED TO REACH APPROXIMATELY 2.5 PERCENT OF WORLD ENERGY BY 2030.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

INDEX TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

THE CORPORATION ANTICIPATES THAT THE WORLDS AVAILABLE OIL AND GAS RESOURCE BASE WILL

GROW NOT ONLY FROM NEW DISCOVERIES, BUT ALSO FROM RESERVE INCREASES IN PREVIOUSLY DISCOVERED FIELDS. TECHNOLOGY WILL UNDERPIN THESE INCREASES. THE COST TO DEVELOP AND SUPPLY THESE RESOURCES WILL BE SIGNIFICANT. ACCORDING TO THE INTERNATIONAL ENERGY

AGENCY, THE INVESTMENT REQUIRED TO MEET TOTAL OIL AND GAS ENERGY NEEDS WORLDWIDE THROUGH 2030 WILL BE CLOSE TO $480 BILLION PER YEAR ON AVERAGE, OR ABOUT $11.1 TRILLION (MEASURED IN 2009 DOLLARS) IN TOTAL OVER THE PERIOD 2008-2030. INTERNATIONAL

ACCORDS AND UNDERLYING REGIONAL AND NATIONAL REGULATIONS FOR GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION ARE EVOLVING WITH UNCERTAIN TIMING AND OUTCOME, MAKING IT DIFFICULT TO PREDICT THEIR BUSINESS IMPACT. EXXONMOBIL INCLUDES ESTIMATES OF POTENTIAL COSTS FOR

ENERGY-RELATED GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS IN ITS LONG-TERM ENERGY OUTLOOK, WHICH IS USED FOR ASSESSING THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT AND IN ITS INVESTMENT EVALUATIONS.

UPSTREAM

EXXONMOBIL CONTINUES TO MAINTAIN A LARGE PORTFOLIO OF EXPLORATION AND DEVELOPMENT

OPPORTUNITIES, WHICH ENABLES THE CORPORATION TO BE SELECTIVE, MAXIMIZING SHAREHOLDER VALUE AND MITIGATING POLITICAL AND TECHNICAL RISKS. EXXONMOBILS FUNDAMENTAL UPSTREAM BUSINESS STRATEGIES GUIDE OUR GLOBAL EXPLORATION, DEVELOPMENT,

PRODUCTION, AND GAS AND POWER MARKETING ACTIVITIES. THESE STRATEGIES INCLUDE IDENTIFYING AND SELECTIVELY PURSUING THE HIGHEST QUALITY EXPLORATION OPPORTUNITIES, INVESTING IN PROJECTS THAT DELIVER SUPERIOR RETURNS, MAXIMIZING PROFITABILITY OF

EXISTING OIL AND GAS PRODUCTION, AND CAPITALIZING ON GROWING NATURAL GAS AND POWER MARKETS. THESE STRATEGIES ARE UNDERPINNED BY A RELENTLESS FOCUS ON OPERATIONAL EXCELLENCE, COMMITMENT TO INNOVATIVE TECHNOLOGIES, DEVELOPMENT OF OUR EMPLOYEES AND

INVESTMENT IN THE COMMUNITIES IN WHICH WE OPERATE.

AS FUTURE DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS BRING NEW PRODUCTION ONLINE, THE

CORPORATION EXPECTS A SHIFT IN THE GEOGRAPHIC MIX OF ITS PRODUCTION VOLUMES BETWEEN NOW AND 2014. OIL AND NATURAL GAS OUTPUT FROM WEST AFRICA, THE CASPIAN REGION, THE MIDDLE EAST AND RUSSIA IS EXPECTED TO INCREASE OVER THE NEXT FIVE YEARS BASED ON

CURRENT CAPITAL PROJECT EXECUTION PLANS. CURRENTLY, THESE GROWTH AREAS ACCOUNT FOR 42 PERCENT OF THE CORPORATIONS PRODUCTION. BY 2014, THEY ARE EXPECTED TO GENERATE ABOUT 50 PERCENT OF TOTAL VOLUMES. THE REMAINDER OF THE CORPORATIONS

PRODUCTION IS EXPECTED TO BE SOURCED FROM ESTABLISHED AREAS, INCLUDING EUROPE, NORTH AMERICA AND ASIA PACIFIC.

IN ADDITION TO

AN EVOLVING GEOGRAPHIC MIX, THERE WILL ALSO BE CONTINUED CHANGE IN THE TYPE OF OPPORTUNITIES FROM WHICH VOLUMES ARE PRODUCED. PRODUCTION FROM DIVERSE RESOURCE TYPES UTILIZING SPECIALIZED TECHNOLOGIES SUCH AS ARCTIC TECHNOLOGY, DEEPWATER DRILLING AND

PRODUCTION SYSTEMS, HEAVY OIL RECOVERY PROCESSES, UNCONVENTIONAL GAS PRODUCTION AND LNG IS EXPECTED TO GROW FROM ABOUT 30 PERCENT TO OVER 40 PERCENT OF THE CORPORATIONS OUTPUT BETWEEN NOW AND 2014. WE DO NOT ANTICIPATE THAT THE EXPECTED CHANGE

IN THE GEOGRAPHIC MIX OF PRODUCTION VOLUMES, AND IN THE TYPES OF OPPORTUNITIES FROM WHICH VOLUMES WILL BE PRODUCED, WILL HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE NATURE AND THE EXTENT OF THE RISKS DISCLOSED IN ITEM 1A OF EXXONMOBILS 2009 FORM 10-K,

OR RESULT IN A MATERIAL CHANGE IN OUR LEVEL OF UNIT OPERATING EXPENSES. THE CORPORATIONS OVERALL VOLUME CAPACITY OUTLOOK, BASED ON PROJECTS COMING ONSTREAM AS ANTICIPATED, IS FOR PRODUCTION CAPACITY TO GROW OVER THE PERIOD 2010-2014. HOWEVER,

ACTUAL VOLUMES WILL VARY FROM YEAR TO YEAR DUE TO THE TIMING OF INDIVIDUAL PROJECT START-UPS, OPERATIONAL OUTAGES, RESERVOIR PERFORMANCE, PERFORMANCE OF ENHANCED OIL RECOVERY PROJECTS, REGULATORY CHANGES, ASSET SALES, WEATHER EVENTS, PRICE EFFECTS

UNDER PRODUCTION SHARING CONTRACTS AND OTHER FACTORS DESCRIBED IN ITEM 1A OF EXXONMOBILS 2009 FORM 10-K. ENHANCED OIL RECOVERY PROJECTS EXTRACT HYDROCARBONS FROM RESERVOIRS IN EXCESS OF THAT WHICH MAY BE PRODUCED THROUGH PRIMARY RECOVERY,

I.E., THROUGH PRESSURE DEPLETION OR NATURAL AQUIFER SUPPORT. THEY INCLUDE THE INJECTION OF WATER, GASES OR CHEMICALS INTO A RESERVOIR TO PRODUCE HYDROCARBONS OTHERWISE UNOBTAINABLE.

MERGER AGREEMENT

ON DECEMBER 13, 2009, EXXONMOBIL AND XTO ENERGY INC. (XTO) ENTERED

INTO AN AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (THE MERGER AGREEMENT). UNDER THE TERMS OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT, (I) EACH SHARE OF XTO COMMON STOCK WILL BE CONVERTED INTO THE RIGHT TO RECEIVE 0.7098 SHARES OF COMMON STOCK OF THE CORPORATION

(THE EXCHANGE RATIO) AND (II) ALL OUTSTANDING XTO OPTIONS WILL BE CONVERTED INTO OPTIONS TO PURCHASE SHARES OF COMMON STOCK OF THE CORPORATION, WITH THE NUMBER OF SHARES OF XTO COMMON STOCK SUBJECT TO THE OPTION, AND THE

OPTIONS EXERCISE PRICE, ADJUSTED BASED ON THE EXCHANGE RATIO. THE TRANSACTION INCLUDES XTO DEBT, WHICH WAS APPROXIMATELY $10.5 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2009.

XTOS REPORTED YEAR-END 2009 PROVED RESERVES OF 14.8 TRILLION CUBIC FEET OF NATURAL GAS EQUIVALENTS INCLUDE SHALE GAS, TIGHT GAS, COAL-BED METHANE AND SHALE OIL. THESE WILL COMPLEMENT

EXXONMOBILS HOLDINGS IN THE UNITED STATES, CANADA, GERMANY, POLAND AND ARGENTINA. XTOS RESOURCE BASE, TECHNICAL EXPERTISE AND HIGHLY SKILLED EMPLOYEES TOGETHER WITH EXXONMOBILS OPERATIONAL AND FINANCIAL STRENGTHS SHOULD ENABLE

DEVELOPMENT OF ADDITIONAL SUPPLIES OF UNCONVENTIONAL NATURAL GAS AND OIL RESOURCES.

CONSUMMATION OF THE MERGER IS SUBJECT TO

CUSTOMARY CONDITIONS, INCLUDING (I) THE ADOPTION OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT BY THE HOLDERS OF XTO COMMON STOCK, (II) THE ABSENCE OF ANY LAW OR ORDER PROHIBITING THE CLOSING, (III) THE EXPIRATION OR TERMINATION OF THE APPLICABLE

HART-SCOTT-RODINO WAITING PERIOD AND RECEIPT OF ANTITRUST CLEARANCE UNDER DUTCH COMPETITION LAWS, (IV) SUBJECT TO CERTAIN EXCEPTIONS, THE ACCURACY OF REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES AND PERFORMANCE OF COVENANTS, (V) THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE

REGISTRATION STATEMENT FOR THE COMMON STOCK OF THE CORPORATION BEING ISSUED IN THE MERGER AND (VI) THE DELIVERY OF CUSTOMARY OPINIONS FROM COUNSEL TO THE CORPORATION AND COUNSEL TO XTO THAT THE MERGER WILL QUALIFY AS A REORGANIZATION FOR

FEDERAL INCOME TAX PURPOSES.

THE CORPORATION AND XTO HAVE MADE CUSTOMARY REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES AND COVENANTS IN THE

MERGER AGREEMENT, INCLUDING, AMONG OTHERS, COVENANTS TO CONDUCT THEIR RESPECTIVE BUSINESSES IN THE ORDINARY COURSE CONSISTENT WITH PAST PRACTICE BETWEEN THE EXECUTION OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT AND CONSUMMATION OF THE MERGER. IN ADDITION, XTO HAS

COVENANTED (I) TO CAUSE A STOCKHOLDER MEETING TO BE HELD TO CONSIDER APPROVAL OF THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THE MERGER AGREEMENT, (II) SUBJECT TO CERTAIN EXCEPTIONS, FOR ITS BOARD OF DIRECTORS TO RECOMMEND APPROVAL BY ITS

STOCKHOLDERS OF THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THE MERGER AGREEMENT, (III) NOT TO SOLICIT PROPOSALS RELATING TO ALTERNATIVE BUSINESS COMBINATION TRANSACTIONS AND (IV) SUBJECT TO CERTAIN EXCEPTIONS, NOT TO ENTER INTO DISCUSSIONS

CONCERNING OR PROVIDE CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION IN CONNECTION WITH ALTERNATIVE BUSINESS COMBINATION TRANSACTIONS.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

ASSUMING THE MERGER IS APPROVED BY XTO STOCKHOLDERS AND IS CLEARED BY REGULATORY AUTHORITIES, THE TRANSACTION WILL BE

ACCOUNTED FOR AS A PURCHASE, WITH XTOS ASSETS AND LIABILITIES REFLECTED IN EXXONMOBILS BOOKS AT FAIR VALUE. THE TRANSACTION SHOULD BE ACCRETIVE TO EXXONMOBILS PRODUCTION GROWTH AND CASH FLOW. DEPENDING ON THE MARKET PRICE FOR GAS,

IT IS NOT LIKELY TO BE ACCRETIVE TO NEAR-TERM EARNINGS PER SHARE AND MAY BE DILUTIVE.

DOWNSTREAM

EXXONMOBILS DOWNSTREAM IS A LARGE, DIVERSIFIED BUSINESS WITH REFINING AND MARKETING COMPLEXES AROUND THE WORLD. THE CORPORATION HAS A STRONG PRESENCE

IN MATURE MARKETS IN NORTH AMERICA AND EUROPE, AS WELL AS THE GROWING ASIA PACIFIC REGION. EXXONMOBILS FUNDAMENTAL DOWNSTREAM BUSINESS STRATEGIES POSITION THE COMPANY TO DELIVER LONG-TERM GROWTH IN SHAREHOLDER VALUE THAT IS SUPERIOR TO

COMPETITION ACROSS A RANGE OF MARKET CONDITIONS. THESE STRATEGIES INCLUDE MAINTAINING BEST-IN-CLASS OPERATIONS IN ALL ASPECTS OF THE BUSINESS, MAXIMIZING VALUE FROM LEADING-EDGE TECHNOLOGIES, CAPITALIZING ON INTEGRATION WITH OTHER EXXONMOBIL

BUSINESSES, SELECTIVELY INVESTING FOR RESILIENT, ADVANTAGED RETURNS, LEADING THE INDUSTRY IN EFFICIENCY AND EFFECTIVENESS, AND PROVIDING QUALITY, VALUED PRODUCTS AND SERVICES TO CUSTOMERS.

EXXONMOBIL HAS AN OWNERSHIP INTEREST IN 37 REFINERIES, LOCATED IN 21 COUNTRIES, WITH DISTILLATION CAPACITY OF 6.3 MILLION BARRELS PER

DAY AND LUBRICANT BASESTOCK MANUFACTURING CAPACITY OF ABOUT 143 THOUSAND BARRELS PER DAY. EXXONMOBILS FUELS AND LUBES MARKETING BUSINESS PORTFOLIOS INCLUDE OPERATIONS AROUND THE WORLD, WITH MULTIPLE CHANNELS TO MARKET SERVING A GLOBALLY

DIVERSE CUSTOMER BASE.

THE DOWNSTREAM INDUSTRY ENVIRONMENT REMAINS VERY CHALLENGING. THE RECENT GLOBAL ECONOMIC RECESSION HAD

A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON THE GLOBAL DEMAND FOR REFINED PRODUCTS, AND THUS PUT CONSIDERABLE DOWNWARD PRESSURE ON WORLDWIDE REFINING MARGINS. FURTHER, IN PRIOR YEARS, THE INDUSTRY HAS EXPERIENCED A PERIOD OF ROBUST REFINING MARGINS, WHICH ENCOURAGED THE

CONSTRUCTION OF ADDITIONAL INDUSTRY CAPACITY. OVER THE PRIOR 20-YEAR PERIOD, INFLATION-ADJUSTED REFINING MARGINS HAVE BEEN FLAT, WITH THE RECENT PRIOR YEARS STRONGER MARGINS OFFSETTING THE LONGER-TERM TREND OF DECLINING MARGINS.

REFINING MARGINS ARE LARGELY DRIVEN BY DIFFERENCES IN COMMODITY PRICES AND ARE A FUNCTION OF THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WHAT A REFINERY PAYS FOR

ITS RAW MATERIALS (PRIMARILY CRUDE OIL) AND THE MARKET PRICES FOR THE RANGE OF PRODUCTS PRODUCED (PRIMARILY GASOLINE, HEATING OIL, DIESEL OIL, JET FUEL AND FUEL OIL). CRUDE OIL AND MANY PRODUCTS ARE WIDELY TRADED WITH PUBLISHED PRICES, INCLUDING

THOSE QUOTED ON MULTIPLE EXCHANGES AROUND THE WORLD (E.G., NEW YORK MERCANTILE EXCHANGE AND INTERCONTINENTAL EXCHANGE). PRICES FOR THESE COMMODITIES ARE DETERMINED BY THE GLOBAL MARKETPLACE AND ARE INFLUENCED BY MANY FACTORS, INCLUDING GLOBAL AND

REGIONAL SUPPLY/DEMAND BALANCES, INVENTORY LEVELS, REFINERY OPERATIONS, IMPORT/EXPORT BALANCES, CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS, SEASONAL DEMAND, WEATHER AND POLITICAL CLIMATE.

EXXONMOBILS LONG-TERM OUTLOOK CONTINUES TO BE THAT REFINING MARGINS WILL GENERALLY DECLINE AS COMPETITION IN THE REFINING INDUSTRY REMAINS INTENSE AND, IN THE NEAR TERM, NEW CAPACITY ADDITIONS

OUTPACE THE GROWTH IN GLOBAL DEMAND. ADDITIONALLY, AS DESCRIBED IN MORE DETAIL IN ITEM 1A OF EXXONMOBILS 2009 FORM 10-K, PROPOSED CARBON POLICY AND OTHER CLIMATE-RELATED REGULATIONS IN MANY COUNTRIES, AS WELL AS THE CONTINUED GROWTH IN

BIOFUELS MANDATES, COULD HAVE NEGATIVE IMPACTS ON THE REFINING BUSINESS.

IN THE RETAIL FUELS MARKETING BUSINESS, ONGOING

INTENSE COMPETITION CONTINUES TO DRIVE DOWN INFLATION-ADJUSTED MARGINS BY ABOUT 2 PERCENT PER YEAR. IN 2009, EXXONMOBIL PROGRESSED THE TRANSITION OF THE DIRECT SERVED (I.E., DEALER, COMPANY-OPERATED) RETAIL NETWORK IN THE U.S. TO A BRANDED

DISTRIBUTOR MODEL. THIS TRANSITION WAS ANNOUNCED IN 2008 AND WILL BE A MULTIYEAR PROCESS.

EXXONMOBIL TAKES A DISCIPLINED

APPROACH TO MANAGING THE DOWNSTREAM CAPITAL EMPLOYED. THE DOWNSTREAM PORTFOLIO IS CONTINUALLY EVALUATED DURING ALL PARTS OF THE BUSINESS CYCLE, AND NUMEROUS ASSET DIVESTMENTS HAVE BEEN MADE OVER THE PAST DECADE. WHEN INVESTING IN THE DOWNSTREAM,

EXXONMOBIL REMAINS FOCUSED ON SELECTIVE AND RESILIENT PROJECTS. THESE INVESTMENTS CAPITALIZE ON THE CORPORATIONS WORLD-CLASS SCALE AND INTEGRATION, INDUSTRY-LEADING EFFICIENCY, LEADING-EDGE TECHNOLOGY AND RESPECTED BRANDS, ENABLING EXXONMOBIL

TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF ATTRACTIVE EMERGING-GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES AROUND THE GLOBE. IN 2009, EXXONMOBIL COMPLETED COMMISSIONING NEW COGENERATION FACILITIES IN FUJIAN, CHINA, AND ANTWERP, BELGIUM, REPRESENTING A TOTAL OF 375 MEGAWATTS, THAT HELP IMPROVE

OUR REFINERY EFFICIENCY. ADDITIONALLY, EXXONMOBIL IS PROGRESSING WITH ANNOUNCED PLANS TO INVEST OVER $1 BILLION IN THREE REFINERIES TO INCREASE THE SUPPLY OF CLEANER-BURNING DIESEL BY ABOUT 140 THOUSAND BARRELS PER DAY. THE COMPANY WILL

CONSTRUCT NEW UNITS AND MODIFY EXISTING FACILITIES AT ITS BATON ROUGE, LA., BAYTOWN, TEXAS, AND ANTWERP, BELGIUM, REFINERIES. IN THE ASIA PACIFIC REGION, EXXONMOBIL AND ITS PARTNERS SINOPEC, FUJIAN PROVINCE AND SAUDI ARAMCO STARTED UP THE INTEGRATED

REFINING AND PETROCHEMICALS FACILITY IN FUJIAN PROVINCE, CHINA. THIS PROJECT EXPANDED THE EXISTING 80-THOUSAND-BARREL-PER-DAY REFINERY TO A 240-THOUSAND-BARREL-PER-DAY HIGH-CONVERSION FACILITY. ADDITIONALLY, THE PROJECT ENCOMPASSES A NEW WORLD-SCALE

INTEGRATED CHEMICAL PLANT. THE PARTNERSHIP ALSO INCLUDES A FUELS MARKETING JOINT VENTURE THAT INCLUDES OVER 750 RETAIL SITES AND A NETWORK OF DISTRIBUTION TERMINALS.

CHEMICAL

WORLDWIDE PETROCHEMICAL DEMAND CONTINUED TO BE WEAK IN THE FIRST HALF OF 2009,

DUE TO THE SOFT ECONOMY. DEMAND INCREASED IN THE SECOND HALF OF THE YEAR, REFLECTING IMPROVED ECONOMIC ACTIVITY, PARTICULARLY IN ASIA PACIFIC. INDUSTRY OPERATING RATES IMPROVED IN THE SECOND HALF OF THE YEAR ON STRONGER DEMAND AND WERE FURTHER

SUPPORTED BY INDUSTRY CAPACITY RATIONALIZATIONS AND DELAYS IN START-UP OF NEW CAPACITY. TIGHTER INDUSTRY SUPPLY/DEMAND BALANCES IN THE SECOND HALF OF THE YEAR SUPPORTED HIGHER PRODUCT PRICES AND IMPROVED INDUSTRY MARGINS.

EXXONMOBIL BENEFITED FROM CONTINUED OPERATIONAL EXCELLENCE AND A BALANCED PORTFOLIO OF PRODUCTS. IN ADDITION TO BEING A WORLDWIDE SUPPLIER

OF PRIMARY PETROCHEMICAL PRODUCTS, EXXONMOBIL CHEMICAL ALSO HAS A NUMBER OF LESS-CYCLICAL BUSINESS LINES. CHEMICALS COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGES ARE ACHIEVED THROUGH ITS BUSINESS MIX, BROAD GEOGRAPHIC COVERAGE, INVESTMENT DISCIPLINE, INTEGRATION OF

CHEMICAL CAPACITY WITH LARGE REFINERIES OR UPSTREAM GAS PROCESSING FACILITIES, ADVANTAGED FEEDSTOCK CAPABILITIES, LEADING PROPRIETARY TECHNOLOGY AND PRODUCT APPLICATION EXPERTISE.

BILLION AT THE END OF 2009, $20.7 BILLION LOWER THAN THE PRIOR YEAR, REFLECTING LOWER EARNINGS AND A HIGHER LEVEL OF CAPITAL SPENDING PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A LOWER LEVEL OF PURCHASES OF EXXONMOBIL SHARES.

CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS WERE $31.4 BILLION AT THE END OF 2008, $2.5 BILLION LOWER THAN THE PRIOR YEAR, REFLECTING $2.7 BILLION OF FOREIGN

EXCHANGE REDUCTIONS FROM THE STRENGTHENING OF THE U.S. DOLLAR IN 2008. CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING, INVESTING AND FINANCING ACTIVITIES ARE DISCUSSED BELOW. FOR ADDITIONAL DETAILS, SEE THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS.

ALTHOUGH THE CORPORATION COULD ISSUE LONG-TERM DEBT AND HAS ACCESS TO SHORT-TERM LIQUIDITY, INTERNALLY GENERATED FUNDS COVER THE MAJORITY OF

ITS FINANCIAL REQUIREMENTS. THE MANAGEMENT OF CASH THAT MAY BE TEMPORARILY AVAILABLE AS SURPLUS TO THE CORPORATIONS IMMEDIATE NEEDS IS CAREFULLY CONTROLLED TO ENSURE THAT IT IS SECURE AND READILY AVAILABLE TO MEET THE CORPORATIONS CASH

REQUIREMENTS AND TO OPTIMIZE RETURNS ON THE CASH BALANCES.

TO SUPPORT CASH FLOWS IN FUTURE PERIODS THE CORPORATION WILL NEED

TO CONTINUALLY FIND AND DEVELOP NEW FIELDS, AND CONTINUE TO DEVELOP AND APPLY NEW TECHNOLOGIES AND RECOVERY PROCESSES TO EXISTING FIELDS, IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN OR INCREASE PRODUCTION. AFTER A PERIOD OF PRODUCTION AT PLATEAU RATES, IT IS THE NATURE OF

OIL AND GAS FIELDS EVENTUALLY TO PRODUCE AT DECLINING RATES FOR THE REMAINDER OF THEIR ECONOMIC LIFE. AVERAGED OVER ALL THE CORPORATIONS EXISTING OIL AND GAS FIELDS AND WITHOUT NEW PROJECTS, EXXONMOBILS PRODUCTION IS EXPECTED TO DECLINE

AT AN AVERAGE OF APPROXIMATELY 5 PERCENT PER YEAR OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS. DECLINE RATES CAN VARY WIDELY BY INDIVIDUAL FIELD DUE TO A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE TYPE OF RESERVOIR, FLUID PROPERTIES, RECOVERY MECHANISMS,

WORK ACTIVITY, AND AGE OF THE FIELD. FURTHERMORE, THE CORPORATIONS NET INTEREST IN PRODUCTION FOR INDIVIDUAL FIELDS CAN VARY WITH PRICE AND CONTRACTUAL TERMS.

THE CORPORATION HAS LONG BEEN SUCCESSFUL AT OFFSETTING THE EFFECTS OF NATURAL FIELD DECLINE THROUGH DISCIPLINED INVESTMENTS IN QUALITY OPPORTUNITIES AND PROJECT EXECUTION. OVER THE LAST DECADE, THIS HAS

RESULTED IN NET ANNUAL ADDITIONS TO PROVED RESERVES THAT HAVE EXCEEDED THE AMOUNT PRODUCED. PROJECTS ARE IN PROGRESS OR PLANNED TO INCREASE PRODUCTION CAPACITY. HOWEVER, THESE VOLUME INCREASES ARE SUBJECT TO A VARIETY OF RISKS INCLUDING PROJECT

START-UP TIMING, OPERATIONAL OUTAGES, RESERVOIR PERFORMANCE, CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS PRICES, WEATHER EVENTS, AND REGULATORY CHANGES. THE CORPORATIONS CASH FLOWS ARE ALSO

TABLE OF CONTENTS

INDEX TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

HIGHLY DEPENDENT ON CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS PRICES. PLEASE REFER TO ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS FOR A MORE

COMPLETE DISCUSSION OF RISKS.

THE CORPORATIONS FINANCIAL STRENGTH, AS EVIDENCED BY ITS AAA/AAA DEBT RATING, ENABLES IT

TO MAKE LARGE, LONG-TERM CAPITAL EXPENDITURES. CAPITAL AND EXPLORATION EXPENDITURES IN 2009 WERE $27.1 BILLION, REFLECTING THE CORPORATIONS CONTINUED ACTIVE INVESTMENT PROGRAM. THE CORPORATION EXPECTS ANNUAL EXPENDITURES TO RANGE FROM $25

BILLION TO $30 BILLION FOR THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS. ACTUAL SPENDING COULD VARY DEPENDING ON THE PROGRESS OF INDIVIDUAL PROJECTS. THE CORPORATION HAS A LARGE AND DIVERSE PORTFOLIO OF DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS AND EXPLORATION OPPORTUNITIES, WHICH HELPS

MITIGATE THE OVERALL POLITICAL AND TECHNICAL RISKS OF THE CORPORATIONS UPSTREAM SEGMENT AND ASSOCIATED CASH FLOW. FURTHER, DUE TO ITS FINANCIAL STRENGTH, DEBT CAPACITY AND DIVERSE PORTFOLIO OF OPPORTUNITIES, THE RISK ASSOCIATED WITH FAILURE OR

DELAY OF ANY SINGLE PROJECT WOULD NOT HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE CORPORATIONS LIQUIDITY OR ABILITY TO GENERATE SUFFICIENT CASH FLOWS FOR OPERATIONS AND ITS FIXED COMMITMENTS. THE PURCHASE AND SALE OF OIL AND GAS PROPERTIES HAVE NOT HAD A

SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE AMOUNT OR TIMING OF CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES.

CASH FLOW FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES

2009

CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES

TOTALED $28.4 BILLION IN 2009, $31.3 BILLION LOWER THAN 2008. THE MAJOR SOURCE OF FUNDS WAS NET INCOME INCLUDING NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS OF $19.7 BILLION, ADJUSTED FOR THE NONCASH PROVISION OF $11.9 BILLION FOR DEPRECIATION AND DEPLETION, BOTH OF

WHICH DECLINED. PENSION FUND CONTRIBUTIONS IN 2009 OF $4.5 BILLION INCREASED FROM $1.0 BILLION IN 2008. THE NET EFFECTS OF CHANGES IN PRICES AND THE TIMING OF COLLECTION OF ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND OF PAYMENTS OF ACCOUNTS AND OTHER PAYABLES AND OF

INCOME TAXES PAYABLE REDUCED CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES IN 2009 COMPARED TO AN INCREASE IN 2008.

2008

CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES TOTALED $59.7 BILLION IN 2008, A $7.7 BILLION INCREASE FROM 2007. THE MAJOR SOURCE OF FUNDS WAS NET INCOME INCLUDING

NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS OF $46.9 BILLION, ADJUSTED FOR THE NONCASH PROVISION OF $12.4 BILLION FOR DEPRECIATION AND DEPLETION, BOTH OF WHICH INCREASED. THE NET EFFECTS OF LOWER PRICES AND THE TIMING OF COLLECTION OF ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND OF

PAYMENTS OF ACCOUNTS AND OTHER PAYABLES AND OF INCOME TAXES PAYABLE ADDED TO CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES.

CASH FLOW FROM

INVESTING ACTIVITIES

2009

CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES NETTED TO $22.4 BILLION IN 2009, $6.9 BILLION HIGHER THAN IN 2008. SPENDING FOR PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT OF $22.5 BILLION IN 2009 INCREASED $3.2 BILLION FROM 2008. PROCEEDS FROM THE SALES OF

SUBSIDIARIES, INVESTMENTS AND PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT OF $1.5 BILLION IN 2009 COMPARED TO $6.0 BILLION IN 2008, THE DECREASE REFLECTING THE ABSENCE OF THE SALE OF THE NATURAL GAS TRANSPORTATION BUSINESS IN GERMANY AND LOWER SALES OF DOWNSTREAM

ASSETS AND INVESTMENTS.

2008

CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES NETTED TO $15.5 BILLION IN 2008, $5.8 BILLION HIGHER THAN IN 2007. SPENDING FOR PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT OF $19.3 BILLION IN 2008 INCREASED $3.9 BILLION FROM 2007. PROCEEDS FROM THE SALES OF

SUBSIDIARIES, INVESTMENTS AND PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT OF $6.0 BILLION IN 2008 COMPARED TO $4.2 BILLION IN 2007, THE INCREASE REFLECTING THE SALE OF THE GERMAN NATURAL GAS TRANSPORTATION BUSINESS IN 2008. CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES IN

2008 WAS HIGHER DUE TO THE ABSENCE OF THE $4.6 BILLION POSITIVE CASH FLOW IN 2007 FROM THE RELEASE OF THE RESTRICTION ON THE RESTRICTED CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS. NET CASH USED FOR INVESTMENTS AND ADVANCES AND THE CHANGE IN MARKETABLE SECURITIES WAS

$1.0 BILLION LOWER IN 2008.

CASH FLOW FROM FINANCING ACTIVITIES

2009

CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES WAS $27.3 BILLION IN 2009, $16.7 BILLION LOWER THAN

2008, REFLECTING A LOWER LEVEL OF PURCHASES OF EXXONMOBIL SHARES. DIVIDEND PAYMENTS ON COMMON SHARES INCREASED TO $1.66 PER SHARE FROM $1.55 PER SHARE AND TOTALED $8.0 BILLION, A PAY-OUT OF 42 PERCENT. TOTAL CONSOLIDATED SHORT-TERM AND LONG-TERM

DEBT INCREASED $0.2 BILLION TO $9.6 BILLION AT YEAR-END 2009.

EXXONMOBIL SHARE OF EQUITY DECREASED $2.4 BILLION IN 2009, TO

$110.6 BILLION. THE ADDITION TO EQUITY FOR EARNINGS OF $19.3 BILLION WAS MORE THAN OFFSET BY REDUCTIONS FOR DISTRIBUTIONS TO EXXONMOBIL SHAREHOLDERS OF $8.0 BILLION OF DIVIDENDS AND $18.0 BILLION OF PURCHASES OF SHARES OF EXXONMOBIL STOCK TO REDUCE

SHARES OUTSTANDING. EQUITY, AND NET ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, INCREASED $3.3 BILLION, REPRESENTING THE FOREIGN EXCHANGE TRANSLATION EFFECTS OF GENERALLY STRONGER FOREIGN CURRENCIES AT THE END OF 2009 ON EXXONMOBILS OPERATIONS OUTSIDE THE UNITED

STATES. THE CHANGE IN THE FUNDED STATUS OF THE POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS RESERVES IN 2009 INCREASED EQUITY BY $1.2 BILLION.

DURING 2009, EXXON MOBIL CORPORATION PURCHASED 277 MILLION SHARES OF ITS COMMON STOCK FOR THE TREASURY AT A GROSS COST OF $19.7 BILLION. THESE PURCHASES WERE TO REDUCE THE NUMBER OF SHARES OUTSTANDING AND TO OFFSET SHARES ISSUED IN

CONJUNCTION WITH COMPANY BENEFIT PLANS AND PROGRAMS. SHARES OUTSTANDING WERE REDUCED BY 5.0 PERCENT FROM 4,976 MILLION AT THE END OF 2008 TO 4,727 MILLION AT THE END OF 2009. PURCHASES WERE MADE IN BOTH THE OPEN MARKET AND THROUGH

NEGOTIATED TRANSACTIONS. PURCHASES MAY BE INCREASED, DECREASED OR DISCONTINUED AT ANY TIME WITHOUT PRIOR NOTICE.

2008

CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES WAS $44.0 BILLION IN 2008, AN INCREASE OF $5.7 BILLION FROM 2007, REFLECTING A HIGHER LEVEL OF PURCHASES OF EXXONMOBIL

SHARES. DIVIDEND PAYMENTS ON COMMON SHARES INCREASED TO $1.55 PER SHARE FROM $1.37 PER SHARE AND TOTALED $8.1 BILLION, A PAY-OUT OF 18 PERCENT. TOTAL CONSOLIDATED SHORT-TERM AND LONG-TERM DEBT DECREASED $0.2 BILLION TO $9.4 BILLION AT YEAR-END 2008.

EXXONMOBIL SHARE OF EQUITY DECREASED $8.8 BILLION IN 2008, TO $113.0 BILLION. EARNINGS OF $45.2 BILLION, REDUCED BY

DISTRIBUTIONS TO EXXONMOBIL SHAREHOLDERS OF $8.1 BILLION OF DIVIDENDS AND $32.0 BILLION OF PURCHASES OF SHARES OF EXXONMOBIL STOCK TO REDUCE SHARES OUTSTANDING, ADDED TO EQUITY. EQUITY, AND NET ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, DECREASED $6.8 BILLION,

EXAMPLES INCLUDE LONG-TERM, NONCANCELABLE LNG AND NATURAL GAS PURCHASE COMMITMENTS AND COMMITMENTS TO PURCHASE REFINERY PRODUCTS AT MARKET PRICES. INCLUSION OF SUCH COMMITMENTS WOULD NOT BE MEANINGFUL IN ASSESSING LIQUIDITY AND CASH FLOW, BECAUSE

THESE PURCHASES WILL BE OFFSET IN THE SAME PERIODS BY CASH RECEIVED FROM THE RELATED SALES TRANSACTIONS. THE TABLE ALSO EXCLUDES UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS TOTALING $4.7 BILLION AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2009, BECAUSE THE CORPORATION IS UNABLE TO MAKE

REASONABLY RELIABLE ESTIMATES OF THE TIMING OF CASH SETTLEMENTS WITH THE RESPECTIVE TAXING AUTHORITIES. FURTHER DETAILS ON THE UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS CAN BE FOUND IN NOTE 18, INCOME, SALES-BASED AND OTHER TAXES.

THE CORPORATIONS FINANCIAL STRENGTH, AS EVIDENCED BY THE ABOVE FINANCIAL RATIOS AND OTHER SIMILAR MEASURES, TO BE A COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE OF STRATEGIC IMPORTANCE. THE CORPORATIONS SOUND FINANCIAL POSITION GIVES IT THE OPPORTUNITY TO

ACCESS THE WORLDS CAPITAL MARKETS IN THE FULL RANGE OF MARKET CONDITIONS, AND ENABLES THE CORPORATION TO TAKE ON LARGE, LONG-TERM CAPITAL COMMITMENTS IN THE PURSUIT OF MAXIMIZING SHAREHOLDER VALUE.

THE CORPORATION MAKES LIMITED USE OF DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS, WHICH ARE DISCUSSED IN NOTE 12.

LITIGATION AND OTHER CONTINGENCIES

LITIGATION

AS DISCUSSED IN NOTE 15, A NUMBER OF LAWSUITS, INCLUDING CLASS ACTIONS, WERE BROUGHT IN VARIOUS COURTS AGAINST

EXXON MOBIL CORPORATION AND CERTAIN OF ITS SUBSIDIARIES RELATING TO THE ACCIDENTAL RELEASE OF CRUDE OIL FROM THE TANKER EXXON VALDEZ IN 1989. ALL THE COMPENSATORY CLAIMS AND THE PUNITIVE DAMAGE AWARD HAVE BEEN PAID.

BASED ON A CONSIDERATION OF ALL RELEVANT FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES, THE CORPORATION DOES NOT BELIEVE THE ULTIMATE OUTCOME OF ANY CURRENTLY

PENDING LAWSUIT AGAINST EXXONMOBIL WILL HAVE A MATERIALLY ADVERSE EFFECT UPON THE CORPORATIONS OPERATIONS OR FINANCIAL CONDITION. THERE ARE NO EVENTS OR UNCERTAINTIES BEYOND THOSE ALREADY INCLUDED IN REPORTED FINANCIAL INFORMATION THAT WOULD

INDICATE A MATERIAL CHANGE IN FUTURE OPERATING RESULTS OR FINANCIAL CONDITION.

OTHER CONTINGENCIES

IN ACCORDANCE WITH A NATIONALIZATION DECREE ISSUED BY VENEZUELAS PRESIDENT IN FEBRUARY 2007, BY MAY 1, 2007, A SUBSIDIARY OF THE VENEZUELAN

NATIONAL OIL COMPANY (PDVSA) ASSUMED THE OPERATORSHIP OF THE CERRO NEGRO HEAVY OIL PROJECT. THIS PROJECT HAD BEEN OPERATED AND OWNED BY EXXONMOBIL AFFILIATES HOLDING A 41.67 PERCENT OWNERSHIP INTEREST IN THE PROJECT. THE DECREE ALSO REQUIRED

CONVERSION OF THE CERRO NEGRO PROJECT INTO A MIXED ENTERPRISE AND AN INCREASE IN PDVSAS OR ONE OF ITS AFFILIATES OWNERSHIP INTEREST IN THE PROJECT, WITH THE STIPULATION THAT IF EXXONMOBIL REFUSED TO ACCEPT THE TERMS FOR THE

FORMATION OF THE MIXED ENTERPRISE WITHIN A SPECIFIED PERIOD OF TIME, THE GOVERNMENT WOULD DIRECTLY ASSUME THE ACTIVITIES CARRIED OUT BY THE JOINT VENTURE. EXXONMOBIL REFUSED TO ACCEDE TO THE TERMS PROFFERED BY THE GOVERNMENT, AND ON

JUNE 27, 2007, THE GOVERNMENT EXPROPRIATED EXXONMOBILS 41.67 PERCENT INTEREST IN THE CERRO NEGRO PROJECT.

ON

SEPTEMBER 6, 2007, AFFILIATES OF EXXONMOBIL FILED A REQUEST FOR ARBITRATION WITH THE INTERNATIONAL CENTRE FOR SETTLEMENT OF INVESTMENT DISPUTES. AN AFFILIATE OF EXXONMOBIL HAS ALSO FILED AN ARBITRATION UNDER THE RULES OF THE INTERNATIONAL

CHAMBER OF COMMERCE AGAINST PDVSA AND A PDVSA AFFILIATE FOR BREACH OF THEIR CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS UNDER CERTAIN CERRO NEGRO PROJECT AGREEMENTS. BOTH ARBITRATION PROCEEDINGS CONTINUE. AT THIS TIME, THE NET IMPACT OF THIS MATTER ON THE

CORPORATIONS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL RESULTS CANNOT BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED. HOWEVER, THE CORPORATION DOES NOT EXPECT THE RESOLUTION TO HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT UPON THE CORPORATIONS OPERATIONS OR FINANCIAL CONDITION. EXXONMOBILS

REMAINING NET BOOK INVESTMENT IN CERRO NEGRO PRODUCING ASSETS IS ABOUT $750 MILLION.

AND EXPLORATION EXPENDITURES IN 2009 WERE $27.1 BILLION, REFLECTING THE CORPORATIONS CONTINUED ACTIVE INVESTMENT PROGRAM. THE CORPORATION EXPECTS ANNUAL EXPENDITURES TO RANGE FROM $25 BILLION TO $30 BILLION FOR THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS. ACTUAL

SPENDING COULD VARY DEPENDING ON THE PROGRESS OF INDIVIDUAL PROJECTS.

UPSTREAM SPENDING OF $20.7 BILLION IN 2009 WAS UP 5

PERCENT FROM 2008, MAINLY DUE TO INCREASED EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION DRILLING ACTIVITY. THE MAJORITY OF THESE EXPENDITURES ARE ON DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS, WHICH TYPICALLY TAKE TWO TO FOUR YEARS FROM THE TIME OF RECORDING PROVED UNDEVELOPED RESERVES TO

THE START OF PRODUCTION FROM THOSE RESERVES. THE PERCENTAGE OF PROVED DEVELOPED RESERVES WAS 67 PERCENT OF TOTAL PROVED RESERVES AT YEAR-END 2009, AND HAS BEEN OVER 60 PERCENT FOR THE LAST FIVE YEARS, INDICATING THAT PROVED RESERVES ARE

THROUGHOUT EXXONMOBILS BUSINESSES, NEW AND ONGOING MEASURES ARE TAKEN TO PREVENT AND MINIMIZE

THE IMPACT OF OUR OPERATIONS ON AIR, WATER AND GROUND. THESE INCLUDE A SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT IN REFINING INFRASTRUCTURE AND TECHNOLOGY TO MANUFACTURE CLEAN FUELS AS WELL AS PROJECTS TO MONITOR AND REDUCE NITROGEN OXIDE, SULFUR OXIDE AND GREENHOUSE

GAS EMISSIONS AND EXPENDITURES FOR ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS. EXXONMOBILS 2009 WORLDWIDE ENVIRONMENTAL EXPENDITURES FOR ALL SUCH PREVENTATIVE AND REMEDIATION STEPS, INCLUDING EXXONMOBILS SHARE OF EQUITY COMPANY EXPENDITURES, WERE

ABOUT $5.1 BILLION. THE TOTAL COST FOR SUCH ACTIVITIES IS EXPECTED TO REMAIN IN THIS RANGE IN 2010 AND 2011 (WITH CAPITAL EXPENDITURES APPROXIMATELY 45 PERCENT OF THE TOTAL).

ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES

THE CORPORATION ACCRUES ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES WHEN IT IS

PROBABLE THAT OBLIGATIONS HAVE BEEN INCURRED AND THE AMOUNTS CAN BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED. THIS POLICY APPLIES TO ASSETS OR BUSINESSES CURRENTLY OWNED OR PREVIOUSLY DISPOSED. EXXONMOBIL HAS ACCRUED LIABILITIES FOR PROBABLE ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION

OBLIGATIONS AT VARIOUS SITES, INCLUDING MULTIPARTY SITES WHERE THE U.S. ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY HAS IDENTIFIED EXXONMOBIL AS ONE OF THE POTENTIALLY RESPONSIBLE PARTIES. THE INVOLVEMENT OF OTHER FINANCIALLY RESPONSIBLE COMPANIES AT THESE

MULTIPARTY SITES COULD MITIGATE EXXONMOBILS ACTUAL JOINT AND SEVERAL LIABILITY EXPOSURE. AT PRESENT, NO INDIVIDUAL SITE IS EXPECTED TO HAVE LOSSES MATERIAL TO EXXONMOBILS OPERATIONS OR FINANCIAL CONDITION. CONSOLIDATED COMPANY PROVISIONS

MADE IN 2009 FOR ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES WERE $504 MILLION ($507 MILLION IN 2008) AND THE BALANCE SHEET REFLECTS ACCUMULATED LIABILITIES OF $943 MILLION AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2009, AND $884 MILLION AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2008.

ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS

THE FAIR

VALUES OF ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS ARE RECORDED AS LIABILITIES ON A DISCOUNTED BASIS WHEN THEY ARE INCURRED, WHICH IS TYPICALLY AT THE TIME ASSETS ARE INSTALLED, WITH AN OFFSETTING AMOUNT BOOKED AS ADDITIONS TO PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT

($156 MILLION FOR 2009). OVER TIME, THE LIABILITIES ARE ACCRETED FOR THE INCREASE IN THEIR PRESENT VALUE, WITH THIS EFFECT INCLUDED IN EXPENSES ($372 MILLION IN 2009). CONSOLIDATED COMPANY EXPENDITURES FOR ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS IN 2009 WERE

$448 MILLION AND THE ENDING BALANCE OF THE OBLIGATIONS RECORDED ON THE BALANCE SHEET AT DECEMBER 31, 2009, TOTALED $8,473 MILLION.

CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES.

CRUDE OIL,

NATURAL GAS, PETROLEUM PRODUCT AND CHEMICAL PRICES HAVE FLUCTUATED IN RESPONSE TO CHANGING MARKET FORCES. THE IMPACTS OF THESE PRICE FLUCTUATIONS ON EARNINGS FROM UPSTREAM, DOWNSTREAM AND CHEMICAL OPERATIONS HAVE VARIED. IN THE UPSTREAM, A $1 PER

BARREL CHANGE IN THE WEIGHTED-AVERAGE REALIZED PRICE OF OIL WOULD HAVE APPROXIMATELY A $375 MILLION ANNUAL AFTER-TAX EFFECT ON UPSTREAM CONSOLIDATED PLUS EQUITY COMPANY EARNINGS. SIMILARLY, A $0.10 PER KCF CHANGE IN THE WORLDWIDE AVERAGE GAS

REALIZATION WOULD HAVE APPROXIMATELY A $175 MILLION ANNUAL AFTER-TAX EFFECT ON UPSTREAM CONSOLIDATED PLUS EQUITY COMPANY EARNINGS. FOR ANY GIVEN PERIOD, THE EXTENT OF ACTUAL BENEFIT OR DETRIMENT WILL BE DEPENDENT ON THE PRICE MOVEMENTS OF INDIVIDUAL

TYPES OF CRUDE OIL, TAXES AND OTHER GOVERNMENT TAKE IMPACTS, PRICE ADJUSTMENT LAGS IN LONG-TERM GAS CONTRACTS, AND CRUDE AND GAS PRODUCTION VOLUMES. ACCORDINGLY, CHANGES IN BENCHMARK PRICES FOR CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS ONLY PROVIDE BROAD INDICATORS

OF CHANGES IN THE EARNINGS EXPERIENCED IN ANY PARTICULAR PERIOD.

IN THE VERY COMPETITIVE DOWNSTREAM AND CHEMICAL

ENVIRONMENTS, EARNINGS ARE PRIMARILY DETERMINED BY MARGIN CAPTURE RATHER THAN ABSOLUTE PRICE LEVELS OF PRODUCTS SOLD. REFINING MARGINS ARE A FUNCTION OF THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WHAT A REFINER PAYS FOR ITS RAW MATERIALS (PRIMARILY CRUDE OIL) AND THE

MARKET PRICES FOR THE RANGE OF PRODUCTS PRODUCED. THESE PRICES IN TURN DEPEND ON GLOBAL AND REGIONAL SUPPLY/DEMAND BALANCES, INVENTORY LEVELS, REFINERY OPERATIONS, IMPORT/EXPORT BALANCES AND WEATHER.

THE GLOBAL ENERGY MARKETS CAN GIVE RISE TO EXTENDED PERIODS IN WHICH MARKET CONDITIONS ARE ADVERSE TO ONE OR MORE OF THE CORPORATIONS

BUSINESSES. SUCH CONDITIONS, ALONG WITH THE CAPITAL-INTENSIVE NATURE OF THE INDUSTRY AND VERY LONG LEAD TIMES ASSOCIATED WITH MANY OF OUR PROJECTS, UNDERSCORE THE IMPORTANCE OF MAINTAINING A STRONG FINANCIAL POSITION. MANAGEMENT VIEWS THE

CORPORATIONS FINANCIAL STRENGTH, INCLUDING THE AAA AND AAA RATINGS OF ITS LONG-TERM DEBT SECURITIES BY STANDARD & POORS AND MOODYS, AS A COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE.

IN GENERAL, SEGMENT RESULTS ARE NOT DEPENDENT ON THE ABILITY TO SELL AND/OR PURCHASE PRODUCTS TO/FROM OTHER SEGMENTS. INSTEAD, WHERE SUCH

SALES TAKE PLACE, THEY ARE THE RESULT OF EFFICIENCIES AND COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGES OF INTEGRATED REFINERY/CHEMICAL COMPLEXES. ADDITIONALLY, INTERSEGMENT SALES ARE AT MARKET-BASED PRICES. THE PRODUCTS BOUGHT AND SOLD BETWEEN SEGMENTS CAN ALSO BE

ACQUIRED IN WORLDWIDE MARKETS THAT HAVE SUBSTANTIAL LIQUIDITY, CAPACITY AND TRANSPORTATION CAPABILITIES. ABOUT 40 PERCENT OF THE CORPORATIONS INTERSEGMENT SALES ARE CRUDE OIL PRODUCED BY THE UPSTREAM AND SOLD TO THE DOWNSTREAM.

OTHER INTERSEGMENT SALES INCLUDE THOSE BETWEEN REFINERIES AND CHEMICAL PLANTS RELATED TO RAW MATERIALS, FEEDSTOCKS AND FINISHED PRODUCTS.

ALTHOUGH PRICE LEVELS OF CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS MAY RISE OR FALL SIGNIFICANTLY OVER THE SHORT TO MEDIUM TERM DUE TO

POLITICAL EVENTS, OPEC ACTIONS AND OTHER FACTORS, INDUSTRY ECONOMICS OVER THE LONG TERM WILL CONTINUE TO BE DRIVEN BY MARKET SUPPLY AND DEMAND. ACCORDINGLY, THE CORPORATION TESTS THE VIABILITY OF ALL OF ITS INVESTMENTS OVER A BROAD RANGE OF FUTURE

PRICES. THE CORPORATIONS ASSESSMENT IS THAT ITS OPERATIONS WILL CONTINUE TO BE SUCCESSFUL IN A VARIETY OF MARKET CONDITIONS. THIS IS THE OUTCOME OF DISCIPLINED INVESTMENT AND ASSET MANAGEMENT PROGRAMS. INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES ARE TESTED

AGAINST A VARIETY OF MARKET CONDITIONS, INCLUDING LOW-PRICE SCENARIOS.

THE CORPORATION HAS AN ACTIVE ASSET MANAGEMENT PROGRAM

IN WHICH UNDERPERFORMING ASSETS ARE EITHER IMPROVED TO ACCEPTABLE LEVELS OR CONSIDERED FOR DIVESTMENT. THE ASSET MANAGEMENT PROGRAM INCLUDES A DISCIPLINED, REGULAR REVIEW TO ENSURE THAT ALL ASSETS ARE CONTRIBUTING TO THE CORPORATIONS STRATEGIC

OBJECTIVES. THE RESULT IS AN EFFICIENT CAPITAL BASE, AND THE CORPORATION HAS SELDOM HAD TO WRITE DOWN THE CARRYING VALUE OF ASSETS, EVEN DURING PERIODS OF LOW COMMODITY PRICES.

RISK MANAGEMENT

THE CORPORATIONS SIZE, STRONG CAPITAL STRUCTURE, GEOGRAPHIC

DIVERSITY AND THE COMPLEMENTARY NATURE OF THE UPSTREAM, DOWNSTREAM AND CHEMICAL BUSINESSES REDUCE THE CORPORATIONS ENTERPRISE-WIDE RISK FROM CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES, CURRENCY RATES AND COMMODITY PRICES. AS A RESULT, THE CORPORATION MAKES

LIMITED USE OF DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS TO MITIGATE THE IMPACT OF SUCH CHANGES. THE CORPORATION DOES NOT ENGAGE IN SPECULATIVE DERIVATIVE ACTIVITIES OR DERIVATIVE TRADING ACTIVITIES NOR DOES IT USE DERIVATIVES WITH LEVERAGED FEATURES. THE CORPORATION

MAINTAINS A SYSTEM OF CONTROLS THAT INCLUDES THE AUTHORIZATION, REPORTING AND MONITORING OF DERIVATIVE ACTIVITY. THE CORPORATIONS LIMITED DERIVATIVE ACTIVITIES POSE NO MATERIAL CREDIT OR MARKET RISKS TO EXXONMOBILS OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL

CONDITION OR LIQUIDITY. NOTE 12 SUMMARIZES THE FAIR VALUE OF DERIVATIVES OUTSTANDING AT YEAR END AND THE GAINS OR LOSSES THAT HAVE BEEN RECOGNIZED IN NET INCOME.

THE CORPORATION IS EXPOSED TO CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES, PRIMARILY ON ITS SHORT-TERM DEBT AND THE PORTION OF LONG-TERM DEBT THAT CARRIES FLOATING INTEREST RATES. THE IMPACT OF A 100-BASIS-POINT CHANGE IN

INTEREST RATES AFFECTING THE CORPORATIONS DEBT WOULD NOT BE MATERIAL TO EARNINGS, CASH FLOW OR FAIR VALUE. THE CORPORATIONS CASH BALANCES EXCEEDED TOTAL DEBT AT YEAR-END 2009 AND 2008. THE CORPORATION IS NOT DEPENDENT ON THE CREDIT

MARKETS TO FUND CURRENT OPERATIONS. HOWEVER, SOME JOINT-VENTURE PARTNERS ARE DEPENDENT ON THE CREDIT MARKETS, AND THEIR FUNDING ABILITY MAY IMPACT THE DEVELOPMENT PACE OF JOINT-VENTURE PROJECTS.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

INDEX TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

THE CORPORATION CONDUCTS BUSINESS IN MANY FOREIGN CURRENCIES AND IS SUBJECT TO EXCHANGE RATE RISK ON CASH FLOWS RELATED

TO SALES, EXPENSES, FINANCING AND INVESTMENT TRANSACTIONS. THE IMPACTS OF FLUCTUATIONS IN EXCHANGE RATES ON EXXONMOBILS GEOGRAPHICALLY AND FUNCTIONALLY DIVERSE OPERATIONS ARE VARIED AND OFTEN OFFSETTING IN AMOUNT. THE CORPORATION MAKES LIMITED

USE OF CURRENCY EXCHANGE CONTRACTS, COMMODITY FORWARDS, SWAPS AND FUTURES CONTRACTS TO MITIGATE THE IMPACT OF CHANGES IN CURRENCY VALUES AND COMMODITY PRICES. EXPOSURES RELATED TO THE CORPORATIONS LIMITED USE OF THE ABOVE CONTRACTS ARE NOT

MATERIAL.

INFLATION AND OTHER UNCERTAINTIES

THE GENERAL RATE OF INFLATION IN MANY MAJOR COUNTRIES OF OPERATION INCREASED IN 2008 BEFORE MODERATING IN 2009, AND THE ASSOCIATED IMPACT ON NON-ENERGY COSTS HAS GENERALLY BEEN MITIGATED BY COST

REDUCTIONS FROM EFFICIENCY AND PRODUCTIVITY IMPROVEMENTS. INCREASED DEMAND FOR CERTAIN SERVICES AND MATERIALS HAS RESULTED IN HIGHER OPERATING AND CAPITAL COSTS IN RECENT YEARS. THE CORPORATION WORKS TO COUNTER UPWARD PRESSURE ON COSTS THROUGH ITS

ECONOMIES OF SCALE IN GLOBAL PROCUREMENT AND ITS EFFICIENT PROJECT MANAGEMENT PRACTICES.

RECENTLY ISSUED

STATEMENTS OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

VARIABLE-INTEREST ENTITIES

IN 2009, THE FASB ISSUED AN ACCOUNTING STANDARD FOR VARIABLE-INTEREST ENTITIES (VIES), WHICH BECAME EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2010. THE STANDARD REQUIRES THE

ENTERPRISE TO QUALITATIVELY ASSESS IF IT IS THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY OF THE VIE AND, IF SO, THE VIE MUST BE CONSOLIDATED. THE CORPORATION DOES NOT EXPECT THE ADOPTION OF THIS STANDARD TO HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE CORPORATIONS FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

THE CORPORATIONS ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL REPORTING FAIRLY REFLECT ITS STRAIGHTFORWARD BUSINESS MODEL INVOLVING THE EXTRACTING, REFINING AND MARKETING OF HYDROCARBONS AND HYDROCARBON-BASED PRODUCTS.

THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN CONFORMITY WITH U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES (GAAP) REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS THAT AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS, LIABILITIES, REVENUES AND EXPENSES AND

THE DISCLOSURE OF CONTINGENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. THE FOLLOWING SUMMARY PROVIDES FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT THE CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND THE JUDGMENTS THAT ARE MADE BY THE CORPORATION IN THE APPLICATION OF THOSE POLICIES.

OIL AND GAS RESERVES

EVALUATIONS OF OIL

AND GAS RESERVES ARE IMPORTANT TO THE EFFECTIVE MANAGEMENT OF UPSTREAM ASSETS. THEY ARE INTEGRAL TO MAKING INVESTMENT DECISIONS ABOUT OIL AND GAS PROPERTIES SUCH AS WHETHER DEVELOPMENT SHOULD PROCEED. OIL AND GAS RESERVE QUANTITIES ARE ALSO USED AS

THE BASIS FOR CALCULATING UNIT-OF-PRODUCTION DEPRECIATION RATES AND FOR EVALUATING IMPAIRMENT. OIL AND GAS RESERVES INCLUDE BOTH PROVED AND UNPROVED RESERVES. CONSISTENT WITH THE DEFINITIONS IN THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSIONS AMENDED

RULE 4-10(A) OF REGULATION S-X, PROVED OIL AND GAS RESERVES ARE THOSE QUANTITIES OF OIL AND GAS, WHICH, BY ANALYSIS OF GEOSCIENCE AND ENGINEERING DATA, CAN BE ESTIMATED WITH REASONABLE CERTAINTY TO BE ECONOMICALLY PRODUCIBLE  FROM A GIVEN DATE

FORWARD, FROM KNOWN RESERVOIRS, AND UNDER EXISTING ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, OPERATING METHODS AND GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS  PRIOR TO THE TIME AT WHICH CONTRACTS PROVIDING THE RIGHT TO OPERATE EXPIRE, UNLESS EVIDENCE INDICATES THAT RENEWAL IS

REASONABLY CERTAIN. UNPROVED RESERVES ARE THOSE WITH LESS THAN REASONABLE CERTAINTY OF RECOVERABILITY AND INCLUDE PROBABLE RESERVES. PROBABLE RESERVES ARE RESERVES THAT ARE MORE LIKELY TO BE RECOVERED THAN NOT.

THE ESTIMATION OF PROVED RESERVES, WHICH IS BASED ON THE REQUIREMENT OF REASONABLE CERTAINTY, IS AN ONGOING PROCESS BASED ON RIGOROUS

TECHNICAL EVALUATIONS, COMMERCIAL AND MARKET ASSESSMENT, AND DETAILED ANALYSIS OF WELL INFORMATION SUCH AS FLOW RATES AND RESERVOIR PRESSURE DECLINES. THE ESTIMATION OF PROVED RESERVES IS CONTROLLED BY THE CORPORATION THROUGH LONG-STANDING APPROVAL

GUIDELINES. RESERVE CHANGES ARE MADE WITHIN A WELL-ESTABLISHED, DISCIPLINED PROCESS DRIVEN BY SENIOR LEVEL GEOSCIENCE AND ENGINEERING PROFESSIONALS, ASSISTED BY THE RESERVES TECHNICAL OVERSIGHT GROUP WHICH HAS SIGNIFICANT TECHNICAL EXPERIENCE,

CULMINATING IN REVIEWS WITH AND APPROVAL BY SENIOR MANAGEMENT. NOTABLY, THE CORPORATION DOES NOT USE SPECIFIC QUANTITATIVE RESERVE TARGETS TO DETERMINE COMPENSATION.

KEY FEATURES OF THE RESERVES ESTIMATION PROCESS INCLUDE.



RIGOROUS PEER-REVIEWED TECHNICAL EVALUATIONS AND ANALYSIS OF WELL AND FIELD PERFORMANCE INFORMATION (SUCH AS FLOW RATES AND RESERVOIR PRESSURE DECLINES) AND



A REQUIREMENT THAT MANAGEMENT MAKE SIGNIFICANT FUNDING COMMITMENTS TOWARD THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE RESERVES PRIOR TO REPORTING AS PROVED.

ALTHOUGH THE CORPORATION IS REASONABLY CERTAIN THAT PROVED RESERVES WILL BE PRODUCED, THE TIMING AND AMOUNT RECOVERED CAN BE AFFECTED BY A

NUMBER OF FACTORS INCLUDING COMPLETION OF DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS, RESERVOIR PERFORMANCE, REGULATORY APPROVALS AND SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN LONG-TERM OIL AND GAS PRICE LEVELS.

PROVED RESERVES CAN BE FURTHER SUBDIVIDED INTO DEVELOPED AND UNDEVELOPED RESERVES. THE PERCENTAGE OF PROVED DEVELOPED RESERVES WAS 67 PERCENT OF TOTAL PROVED RESERVES AT YEAR-END 2009 (INCLUDING BOTH

CONSOLIDATED AND EQUITY COMPANY RESERVES), AND HAS BEEN OVER 60 PERCENT FOR THE LAST FIVE YEARS, INDICATING THAT PROVED RESERVES ARE CONSISTENTLY MOVED FROM UNDEVELOPED TO DEVELOPED STATUS. OVER TIME, THESE UNDEVELOPED RESERVES WILL BE RECLASSIFIED

TO THE DEVELOPED CATEGORY AS NEW WELLS ARE DRILLED, EXISTING WELLS ARE RECOMPLETED AND/OR FACILITIES TO COLLECT AND DELIVER THE PRODUCTION FROM EXISTING AND FUTURE WELLS ARE INSTALLED. MAJOR DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS TYPICALLY TAKE TWO TO FOUR YEARS FROM

THE TIME OF RECORDING PROVED RESERVES TO THE START OF PRODUCTION FROM THESE RESERVES.

56

TABLE OF CONTENTS

INDEX TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

REVISIONS CAN INCLUDE UPWARD OR DOWNWARD CHANGES IN PREVIOUSLY ESTIMATED VOLUMES OF PROVED

RESERVES FOR EXISTING FIELDS DUE TO THE EVALUATION OR RE-EVALUATION OF (1) ALREADY AVAILABLE GEOLOGIC, RESERVOIR OR PRODUCTION DATA, (2) NEW GEOLOGIC, RESERVOIR OR PRODUCTION DATA OR (3) CHANGES IN PRICES AND COSTS THAT ARE USED IN

THE ESTIMATION OF RESERVES. THIS CATEGORY CAN ALSO INCLUDE SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN EITHER DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY OR PRODUCTION EQUIPMENT/FACILITY CAPACITY.

THE CORPORATION USES THE SUCCESSFUL EFFORTS METHOD TO ACCOUNT FOR ITS EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION ACTIVITIES. UNDER THIS METHOD, COSTS ARE ACCUMULATED ON A FIELD-BY-FIELD BASIS WITH CERTAIN

EXPLORATORY EXPENDITURES AND EXPLORATORY DRY HOLES BEING EXPENSED AS INCURRED. COSTS OF PRODUCTIVE WELLS AND DEVELOPMENT DRY HOLES ARE CAPITALIZED AND AMORTIZED ON THE UNIT-OF-PRODUCTION METHOD. THE CORPORATION USES THIS ACCOUNTING POLICY INSTEAD OF

THE FULL COST METHOD BECAUSE IT PROVIDES A MORE TIMELY ACCOUNTING OF THE SUCCESS OR FAILURE OF THE CORPORATIONS EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION ACTIVITIES. IF THE FULL COST METHOD WERE USED, ALL COSTS WOULD BE CAPITALIZED AND

DEPRECIATED ON A COUNTRY-BY-COUNTRY BASIS. THE CAPITALIZED COSTS WOULD BE SUBJECT TO AN IMPAIRMENT TEST BY COUNTRY. THE FULL COST METHOD WOULD TEND TO DELAY THE EXPENSE RECOGNITION OF UNSUCCESSFUL PROJECTS.

IMPACT OF OIL AND GAS RESERVES ON DEPRECIATION.

THE CALCULATION OF UNIT-OF-PRODUCTION DEPRECIATION IS A CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATE THAT MEASURES

THE DEPRECIATION OF UPSTREAM ASSETS. IT IS THE RATIO OF ACTUAL VOLUMES PRODUCED TO TOTAL PROVED DEVELOPED RESERVES (THOSE PROVED RESERVES RECOVERABLE THROUGH EXISTING WELLS WITH EXISTING EQUIPMENT AND OPERATING METHODS), APPLIED TO THE ASSET COST.

THE VOLUMES PRODUCED AND ASSET COST ARE KNOWN AND, WHILE PROVED DEVELOPED RESERVES HAVE A HIGH PROBABILITY OF RECOVERABILITY, THEY ARE BASED ON ESTIMATES THAT ARE SUBJECT TO SOME VARIABILITY. WHILE THE REVISIONS THE CORPORATION HAS MADE IN THE PAST

ARE AN INDICATOR OF VARIABILITY, THEY HAVE HAD A VERY SMALL IMPACT ON THE UNIT-OF-PRODUCTION RATES BECAUSE THEY HAVE BEEN SMALL COMPARED TO THE LARGE RESERVES BASE.

IMPACT OF OIL AND GAS RESERVES AND PRICES ON TESTING FOR IMPAIRMENT.

PROVED OIL AND GAS PROPERTIES HELD AND USED BY THE CORPORATION ARE REVIEWED FOR IMPAIRMENT WHENEVER EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES

INDICATE THAT THE CARRYING AMOUNTS MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE. ASSETS ARE GROUPED AT THE LOWEST LEVEL FOR WHICH THERE ARE IDENTIFIABLE CASH FLOWS THAT ARE LARGELY INDEPENDENT OF THE CASH FLOWS OF OTHER GROUPS OF ASSETS.

THE CORPORATION ESTIMATES THE FUTURE UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS OF THE AFFECTED PROPERTIES TO JUDGE THE RECOVERABILITY OF CARRYING AMOUNTS. IN

GENERAL, ANALYSES ARE BASED ON PROVED RESERVES. WHERE PROBABLE RESERVES EXIST, AN APPROPRIATELY RISK-ADJUSTED AMOUNT OF THESE RESERVES MAY BE INCLUDED IN THE IMPAIRMENT EVALUATION. AN ASSET WOULD BE IMPAIRED IF THE UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS WERE LESS

THAN ITS CARRYING VALUE. IMPAIRMENTS ARE MEASURED BY THE AMOUNT BY WHICH THE CARRYING VALUE EXCEEDS ITS FAIR VALUE.

THE

CORPORATION PERFORMS ASSET VALUATION ANALYSES ON AN ONGOING BASIS AS A PART OF ITS ASSET MANAGEMENT PROGRAM. THESE ANALYSES MONITOR THE PERFORMANCE OF ASSETS AGAINST CORPORATE OBJECTIVES. THEY ALSO ASSIST THE CORPORATION IN ASSESSING WHETHER THE

CARRYING AMOUNTS OF ANY OF ITS ASSETS MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE. IN ADDITION TO ESTIMATING OIL AND GAS RESERVE VOLUMES IN CONDUCTING THESE ANALYSES, IT IS ALSO NECESSARY TO ESTIMATE FUTURE OIL AND GAS PRICES. TRIGGER EVENTS FOR IMPAIRMENT EVALUATION

INCLUDE A SIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN CURRENT AND PROJECTED RESERVE VOLUMES, AN ACCUMULATION OF PROJECT COSTS SIGNIFICANTLY IN EXCESS OF THE AMOUNT ORIGINALLY EXPECTED, AND HISTORICAL AND FORECAST OPERATING LOSSES.

IN GENERAL, THE CORPORATION DOES NOT VIEW TEMPORARILY LOW OIL AND GAS PRICES AS A TRIGGER EVENT FOR CONDUCTING THE IMPAIRMENT TESTS. THE

MARKETS FOR CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS HAVE A HISTORY OF SIGNIFICANT PRICE VOLATILITY. ALTHOUGH PRICES WILL OCCASIONALLY DROP SIGNIFICANTLY, INDUSTRY PRICES OVER THE LONG TERM WILL CONTINUE TO BE DRIVEN BY MARKET SUPPLY AND DEMAND. ON THE SUPPLY

SIDE, INDUSTRY PRODUCTION FROM MATURE FIELDS IS DECLINING, BUT THIS IS BEING OFFSET BY PRODUCTION FROM NEW DISCOVERIES AND FIELD DEVELOPMENTS. OPEC PRODUCTION POLICIES ALSO HAVE AN IMPACT ON WORLD OIL SUPPLIES. THE DEMAND SIDE IS LARGELY A FUNCTION

OF GLOBAL ECONOMIC GROWTH. THE RELATIVE GROWTH/DECLINE IN SUPPLY VERSUS DEMAND WILL DETERMINE INDUSTRY PRICES OVER THE LONG TERM, AND THESE CANNOT BE ACCURATELY PREDICTED. ACCORDINGLY, ANY IMPAIRMENT TESTS THAT THE CORPORATION PERFORMS MAKE USE OF

THE CORPORATIONS PRICE ASSUMPTIONS DEVELOPED IN THE ANNUAL PLANNING AND BUDGETING PROCESS FOR THE CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS MARKETS, PETROLEUM PRODUCTS AND CHEMICALS. THESE ARE THE SAME PRICE ASSUMPTIONS THAT ARE USED FOR CAPITAL INVESTMENT

DECISIONS. VOLUMES ARE BASED ON INDIVIDUAL FIELD PRODUCTION PROFILES, WHICH ARE UPDATED ANNUALLY. CASH FLOW ESTIMATES FOR IMPAIRMENT TESTING EXCLUDE THE USE OF DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS.

SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION REGARDING OIL AND GAS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, CAPITALIZED COSTS AND RESERVES IS PROVIDED FOLLOWING THE NOTES

TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. FUTURE PRICES USED FOR ANY IMPAIRMENT TESTS WILL VARY FROM THE ONE USED IN THE SUPPLEMENTAL OIL AND GAS DISCLOSURE AND COULD BE LOWER OR HIGHER FOR ANY GIVEN YEAR.

SUSPENDED EXPLORATORY WELL COSTS

THE

CORPORATION CARRIES AS AN ASSET EXPLORATORY WELL COSTS WHEN THE WELL HAS FOUND A SUFFICIENT QUANTITY OF RESERVES TO JUSTIFY ITS COMPLETION AS A PRODUCING WELL AND WHERE THE CORPORATION IS MAKING SUFFICIENT PROGRESS ASSESSING THE RESERVES AND THE

ECONOMIC AND OPERATING VIABILITY OF THE PROJECT. EXPLORATORY WELL COSTS NOT MEETING THESE CRITERIA ARE CHARGED TO EXPENSE. ASSESSING WHETHER A PROJECT HAS MADE SUFFICIENT PROGRESS IS A SUBJECTIVE AREA AND REQUIRES CAREFUL CONSIDERATION OF THE

RELEVANT FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES. THE FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES THAT SUPPORT CONTINUED CAPITALIZATION OF SUSPENDED WELLS AS OF YEAR-END 2009 ARE DISCLOSED IN NOTE 9 TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

CONSOLIDATIONS

THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDE THE ACCOUNTS OF THOSE SUBSIDIARIES THAT THE CORPORATION CONTROLS. THEY ALSO INCLUDE THE CORPORATIONS SHARE OF THE UNDIVIDED INTEREST IN CERTAIN UPSTREAM

ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. AMOUNTS REPRESENTING THE CORPORATIONS PERCENTAGE INTEREST IN THE UNDERLYING NET ASSETS OF OTHER SIGNIFICANT AFFILIATES THAT IT DOES NOT CONTROL, BUT EXERCISES SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE, ARE INCLUDED IN INVESTMENTS,

ADVANCES AND LONG-TERM RECEIVABLES; THE CORPORATIONS SHARE OF THE NET INCOME OF THESE COMPANIES IS INCLUDED IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF INCOME CAPTION INCOME FROM EQUITY AFFILIATES. THE ACCOUNTING FOR THESE

NON-CONSOLIDATED COMPANIES IS REFERRED TO AS THE EQUITY METHOD OF ACCOUNTING.

MAJORITY OWNERSHIP IS NORMALLY THE INDICATOR OF

CONTROL THAT IS THE BASIS ON WHICH SUBSIDIARIES ARE CONSOLIDATED. HOWEVER, CERTAIN FACTORS MAY INDICATE THAT A MAJORITY-OWNED INVESTMENT IS NOT CONTROLLED AND THEREFORE SHOULD BE ACCOUNTED FOR USING THE EQUITY METHOD OF ACCOUNTING. THESE FACTORS

OCCUR WHERE THE MINORITY SHAREHOLDERS ARE GRANTED BY LAW OR BY CONTRACT SUBSTANTIVE PARTICIPATING RIGHTS. THESE INCLUDE THE RIGHT TO APPROVE OPERATING POLICIES, EXPENSE BUDGETS, FINANCING AND INVESTMENT PLANS AND MANAGEMENT COMPENSATION AND

SUCCESSION PLANS.

ADDITIONAL DISCLOSURES OF SUMMARY BALANCE SHEET AND INCOME INFORMATION FOR THOSE SUBSIDIARIES ACCOUNTED FOR

UNDER THE EQUITY METHOD OF ACCOUNTING CAN BE FOUND IN NOTE 6.

INVESTMENTS IN COMPANIES THAT ARE PARTIALLY OWNED BY THE

CORPORATION ARE INTEGRAL TO THE CORPORATIONS OPERATIONS. IN SOME CASES THEY SERVE TO BALANCE WORLDWIDE RISKS AND IN OTHERS THEY PROVIDE THE ONLY AVAILABLE MEANS OF ENTRY INTO A PARTICULAR MARKET OR AREA OF INTEREST. THE OTHER PARTIES WHO ALSO

HAVE AN EQUITY INTEREST IN THESE COMPANIES ARE EITHER INDEPENDENT THIRD PARTIES OR HOST GOVERNMENTS THAT SHARE IN THE BUSINESS RESULTS ACCORDING TO THEIR PERCENTAGE OWNERSHIP. THE CORPORATION DOES NOT INVEST IN THESE COMPANIES IN ORDER TO REMOVE

LIABILITIES FROM ITS BALANCE SHEET. IN FACT, THE CORPORATION HAS LONG BEEN ON RECORD SUPPORTING AN ALTERNATIVE ACCOUNTING METHOD THAT WOULD REQUIRE EACH INVESTOR TO CONSOLIDATE ITS PERCENTAGE SHARE OF ALL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES IN THESE PARTIALLY

OWNED COMPANIES RATHER THAN ONLY ITS PERCENTAGE IN THE NET EQUITY. THIS METHOD OF ACCOUNTING FOR INVESTMENTS IN PARTIALLY OWNED COMPANIES IS NOT PERMITTED BY GAAP EXCEPT WHERE THE INVESTMENTS ARE IN THE DIRECT OWNERSHIP OF A SHARE OF UPSTREAM ASSETS

AND LIABILITIES. HOWEVER, FOR PURPOSES OF CALCULATING RETURN ON AVERAGE CAPITAL EMPLOYED, WHICH IS NOT COVERED BY GAAP STANDARDS, THE CORPORATION INCLUDES ITS SHARE OF DEBT OF THESE PARTIALLY OWNED COMPANIES IN THE DETERMINATION OF AVERAGE CAPITAL

EMPLOYED.

PENSION BENEFITS

THE CORPORATION AND ITS AFFILIATES SPONSOR APPROXIMATELY 100 DEFINED BENEFIT (PENSION) PLANS IN ABOUT 50 COUNTRIES. THE FUNDING ARRANGEMENT FOR EACH PLAN DEPENDS ON THE PREVAILING PRACTICES AND REGULATIONS OF THE COUNTRIES WHERE THE

CORPORATION OPERATES. PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS (NOTE 16) PROVIDES DETAILS ON PENSION OBLIGATIONS, FUND ASSETS AND PENSION EXPENSE.

SOME OF THESE PLANS (PRIMARILY NON-U.S.) PROVIDE PENSION BENEFITS THAT ARE PAID DIRECTLY BY THEIR SPONSORING AFFILIATES OUT OF CORPORATE CASH FLOW RATHER THAN A SEPARATE PENSION FUND. BOOK RESERVES ARE

ESTABLISHED FOR THESE PLANS BECAUSE TAX CONVENTIONS AND REGULATORY PRACTICES DO NOT ENCOURAGE ADVANCE FUNDING. THE PORTION OF THE PENSION COST ATTRIBUTABLE TO EMPLOYEE SERVICE IS EXPENSED AS SERVICES ARE RENDERED. THE PORTION ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE

INCREASE IN PENSION OBLIGATIONS DUE TO THE PASSAGE OF TIME IS EXPENSED OVER THE TERM OF THE OBLIGATIONS, WHICH ENDS WHEN ALL BENEFITS ARE PAID. THE PRIMARY DIFFERENCE IN PENSION EXPENSE FOR UNFUNDED VERSUS FUNDED PLANS IS THAT PENSION EXPENSE FOR

FUNDED PLANS ALSO INCLUDES A CREDIT FOR THE EXPECTED LONG-TERM RETURN ON FUND ASSETS.

FOR FUNDED PLANS, INCLUDING THOSE IN

THE UNITED STATES, PENSION OBLIGATIONS ARE FINANCED IN ADVANCE THROUGH SEGREGATED ASSETS OR INSURANCE ARRANGEMENTS. THESE PLANS ARE MANAGED IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE REQUIREMENTS OF GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORITIES AND MEET OR EXCEED REQUIRED FUNDING LEVELS AS

MEASURED BY RELEVANT ACTUARIAL AND GOVERNMENT STANDARDS AT THE MANDATED MEASUREMENT DATES. IN DETERMINING LIABILITIES AND REQUIRED CONTRIBUTIONS, THESE STANDARDS OFTEN REQUIRE APPROACHES AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT DIFFER FROM THOSE USED FOR ACCOUNTING

PURPOSES.

THE CORPORATION WILL CONTINUE TO MAKE CONTRIBUTIONS TO THESE FUNDED PLANS AS NECESSARY. ALL DEFINED-BENEFIT PENSION

OBLIGATIONS, REGARDLESS OF THE FUNDING STATUS OF THE UNDERLYING PLANS, ARE FULLY SUPPORTED BY THE FINANCIAL STRENGTH OF THE CORPORATION OR THE RESPECTIVE SPONSORING AFFILIATE.

PENSION ACCOUNTING REQUIRES EXPLICIT ASSUMPTIONS REGARDING, AMONG OTHERS, THE LONG-TERM EXPECTED EARNINGS RATE ON FUND ASSETS, THE DISCOUNT

RATE FOR THE BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS AND THE LONG-TERM RATE FOR FUTURE SALARY INCREASES. PENSION ASSUMPTIONS ARE REVIEWED ANNUALLY BY OUTSIDE ACTUARIES AND SENIOR MANAGEMENT. THESE ASSUMPTIONS ARE ADJUSTED AS APPROPRIATE TO REFLECT CHANGES IN MARKET

RATES AND OUTLOOK. THE LONG-TERM EXPECTED EARNINGS RATE ON U.S. PENSION PLAN ASSETS IN 2009 WAS 8.0 PERCENT. THE 10-YEAR AND 20-YEAR ACTUAL RETURNS ON U.S. PENSION PLAN ASSETS ARE 3 PERCENT AND 9 PERCENT, RESPECTIVELY. THE CORPORATION ESTABLISHES

THE LONG-TERM EXPECTED RATE OF RETURN BY DEVELOPING A FORWARD-LOOKING, LONG-TERM RETURN ASSUMPTION FOR EACH PENSION FUND ASSET CLASS, TAKING INTO ACCOUNT FACTORS SUCH AS THE EXPECTED REAL RETURN

FOR THE SPECIFIC ASSET CLASS AND INFLATION. A SINGLE, LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN IS THEN CALCULATED AS THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE OF THE TARGET ASSET ALLOCATION AND THE LONG-TERM RETURN ASSUMPTION FOR

EACH ASSET CLASS. A WORLDWIDE REDUCTION OF 0.5 PERCENT IN THE LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN ON ASSETS WOULD INCREASE ANNUAL PENSION EXPENSE BY APPROXIMATELY $130 MILLION BEFORE TAX.

DIFFERENCES BETWEEN ACTUAL RETURNS ON FUND ASSETS AND THE LONG-TERM EXPECTED RETURN ARE NOT RECOGNIZED IN PENSION EXPENSE IN THE YEAR

THAT THE DIFFERENCE OCCURS. SUCH DIFFERENCES ARE DEFERRED, ALONG WITH OTHER ACTUARIAL GAINS AND LOSSES, AND ARE AMORTIZED INTO PENSION EXPENSE OVER THE EXPECTED REMAINING SERVICE LIFE OF EMPLOYEES.

LITIGATION CONTINGENCIES

A VARIETY OF

CLAIMS HAVE BEEN MADE AGAINST THE CORPORATION AND CERTAIN OF ITS CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES IN A NUMBER OF PENDING LAWSUITS. MANAGEMENT HAS REGULAR LITIGATION REVIEWS, INCLUDING UPDATES FROM CORPORATE AND OUTSIDE COUNSEL, TO ASSESS THE NEED FOR

ACCOUNTING RECOGNITION OR DISCLOSURE OF THESE CONTINGENCIES. THE STATUS OF SIGNIFICANT CLAIMS IS SUMMARIZED IN NOTE 15.

GAAP

REQUIRES THAT LIABILITIES FOR CONTINGENCIES BE RECORDED WHEN IT IS PROBABLE THAT A LIABILITY HAS BEEN INCURRED BY THE DATE OF THE BALANCE SHEET AND THAT THE AMOUNT CAN BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED. THESE AMOUNTS ARE NOT REDUCED BY AMOUNTS THAT MAY BE

RECOVERED UNDER INSURANCE OR CLAIMS AGAINST THIRD PARTIES, BUT UNDISCOUNTED RECEIVABLES FROM INSURERS OR OTHER THIRD PARTIES MAY BE ACCRUED SEPARATELY. THE CORPORATION REVISES SUCH ACCRUALS IN LIGHT OF NEW INFORMATION. FOR CONTINGENCIES WHERE AN

UNFAVORABLE OUTCOME IS REASONABLY POSSIBLE AND WHICH ARE SIGNIFICANT, THE CORPORATION DISCLOSES THE NATURE OF THE CONTINGENCY AND, WHERE FEASIBLE, AN ESTIMATE OF THE POSSIBLE LOSS.

SIGNIFICANT MANAGEMENT JUDGMENT IS REQUIRED RELATED TO CONTINGENT LIABILITIES AND THE OUTCOME OF LITIGATION BECAUSE BOTH ARE DIFFICULT TO

PREDICT. HOWEVER, THE CORPORATION HAS BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN DEFENDING LITIGATION IN THE PAST. PAYMENTS HAVE NOT HAD A MATERIALLY ADVERSE EFFECT ON OPERATIONS OR FINANCIAL CONDITION. IN THE CORPORATIONS EXPERIENCE, LARGE CLAIMS OFTEN DO NOT RESULT

IN LARGE AWARDS. LARGE AWARDS ARE OFTEN REVERSED OR SUBSTANTIALLY REDUCED AS A RESULT OF APPEAL OR SETTLEMENT.

TAX CONTINGENCIES

THE CORPORATION IS SUBJECT TO INCOME TAXATION IN MANY JURISDICTIONS AROUND THE WORLD. SIGNIFICANT MANAGEMENT JUDGMENT IS REQUIRED IN THE

ACCOUNTING FOR INCOME TAX CONTINGENCIES AND TAX DISPUTES BECAUSE THE OUTCOMES ARE OFTEN DIFFICULT TO PREDICT.

GAAP REQUIRES

RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT OF UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS THAT THE CORPORATION HAS TAKEN OR EXPECTS TO TAKE IN ITS INCOME TAX RETURNS. THE BENEFIT OF AN UNCERTAIN TAX POSITION CAN ONLY BE RECOGNIZED IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IF MANAGEMENT CONCLUDES

THAT IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT THE POSITION WILL BE SUSTAINED WITH THE TAX AUTHORITIES. FOR A POSITION THAT IS LIKELY TO BE SUSTAINED, THE BENEFIT RECOGNIZED IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IS MEASURED AT THE LARGEST AMOUNT THAT IS GREATER THAN 50

PERCENT LIKELY OF BEING REALIZED. A RESERVE IS ESTABLISHED FOR THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A POSITION TAKEN IN AN INCOME TAX RETURN AND THE AMOUNT RECOGNIZED IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. THE CORPORATIONS UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS AND A DESCRIPTION

OF OPEN TAX YEARS ARE SUMMARIZED IN NOTE 18.

FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION

THE METHOD OF TRANSLATING THE FOREIGN CURRENCY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF THE CORPORATIONS INTERNATIONAL SUBSIDIARIES INTO U.S. DOLLARS IS PRESCRIBED BY

GAAP. UNDER THESE PRINCIPLES, IT IS NECESSARY TO SELECT THE FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY OF THESE SUBSIDIARIES. THE FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY IS THE CURRENCY OF THE PRIMARY ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH THE SUBSIDIARY OPERATES. MANAGEMENT SELECTS THE FUNCTIONAL

CURRENCY AFTER EVALUATING THIS ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT. DOWNSTREAM AND CHEMICAL OPERATIONS USE THE LOCAL CURRENCY, EXCEPT IN COUNTRIES WITH A HISTORY OF HIGH INFLATION (PRIMARILY IN LATIN AMERICA) AND SINGAPORE, WHICH USES THE U.S. DOLLAR BECAUSE IT

PREDOMINANTLY SELLS INTO THE U.S. DOLLAR EXPORT MARKET. UPSTREAM OPERATIONS ALSO USE THE LOCAL CURRENCY AS THE FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY, EXCEPT WHERE CRUDE AND NATURAL GAS PRODUCTION IS PREDOMINANTLY SOLD IN THE EXPORT MARKET IN U.S. DOLLARS. UPSTREAM

OPERATIONS USING THE U.S. DOLLAR AS THEIR FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY ARE PRIMARILY IN ASIA, WEST AFRICA, RUSSIA AND THE MIDDLE EAST.

FACTORS CONSIDERED BY MANAGEMENT WHEN DETERMINING THE FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY FOR A SUBSIDIARY INCLUDE: THE CURRENCY USED FOR CASH FLOWS RELATED TO INDIVIDUAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES; THE RESPONSIVENESS OF SALES PRICES TO CHANGES IN EXCHANGE

RATES; THE HISTORY OF INFLATION IN THE COUNTRY; WHETHER SALES ARE INTO LOCAL MARKETS OR EXPORTED; THE CURRENCY USED TO ACQUIRE RAW MATERIALS, LABOR, SERVICES AND SUPPLIES; SOURCES OF FINANCING; AND SIGNIFICANCE OF INTERCOMPANY TRANSACTIONS.

STANDARDS OF THE PUBLIC COMPANY ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BOARD (UNITED STATES). THOSE STANDARDS REQUIRE THAT WE PLAN AND PERFORM THE AUDITS TO OBTAIN REASONABLE ASSURANCE ABOUT WHETHER THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE FREE OF MATERIAL MISSTATEMENT AND

WHETHER EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING WAS MAINTAINED IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS. OUR AUDITS OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED EXAMINING, ON A TEST BASIS, EVIDENCE SUPPORTING THE AMOUNTS AND DISCLOSURES IN THE FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS, ASSESSING THE ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES USED AND SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES MADE BY MANAGEMENT, AND EVALUATING THE OVERALL FINANCIAL STATEMENT PRESENTATION. OUR AUDIT OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING INCLUDED OBTAINING AN

UNDERSTANDING OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, ASSESSING THE RISK THAT A MATERIAL WEAKNESS EXISTS, AND TESTING AND EVALUATING THE DESIGN AND OPERATING EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL CONTROL BASED ON THE ASSESSED RISK. OUR AUDITS ALSO

INCLUDED PERFORMING SUCH OTHER PROCEDURES AS WE CONSIDERED NECESSARY IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR AUDITS PROVIDE A REASONABLE BASIS FOR OUR OPINIONS.

INDEX TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

A COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING IS A PROCESS DESIGNED TO PROVIDE REASONABLE

ASSURANCE REGARDING THE RELIABILITY OF FINANCIAL REPORTING AND THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR EXTERNAL PURPOSES IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES. A COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

INCLUDES THOSE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES THAT (I) PERTAIN TO THE MAINTENANCE OF RECORDS THAT, IN REASONABLE DETAIL, ACCURATELY AND FAIRLY REFLECT THE TRANSACTIONS AND DISPOSITIONS OF THE ASSETS OF THE COMPANY; (II) PROVIDE REASONABLE

ASSURANCE THAT TRANSACTIONS ARE RECORDED AS NECESSARY TO PERMIT PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES, AND THAT RECEIPTS AND EXPENDITURES OF THE COMPANY ARE BEING MADE ONLY IN ACCORDANCE WITH

AUTHORIZATIONS OF MANAGEMENT AND DIRECTORS OF THE COMPANY; AND (III) PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING PREVENTION OR TIMELY DETECTION OF UNAUTHORIZED ACQUISITION, USE, OR DISPOSITION OF THE COMPANYS ASSETS THAT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL

EFFECT ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

BECAUSE OF ITS INHERENT LIMITATIONS, INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING MAY NOT PREVENT OR DETECT

MISSTATEMENTS. ALSO, PROJECTIONS OF ANY EVALUATION OF EFFECTIVENESS TO FUTURE PERIODS ARE SUBJECT TO THE RISK THAT CONTROLS MAY BECOME INADEQUATE BECAUSE OF CHANGES IN CONDITIONS, OR THAT THE DEGREE OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE POLICIES OR PROCEDURES MAY

DETERIORATE.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

INDEX TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND THE SUPPORTING AND SUPPLEMENTAL MATERIAL ARE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE MANAGEMENT OF EXXON MOBIL

CORPORATION.

THE CORPORATIONS PRINCIPAL BUSINESS IS ENERGY, INVOLVING THE WORLDWIDE EXPLORATION, PRODUCTION,

TRANSPORTATION AND SALE OF CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS (UPSTREAM) AND THE MANUFACTURE, TRANSPORTATION AND SALE OF PETROLEUM PRODUCTS (DOWNSTREAM). THE CORPORATION IS ALSO A MAJOR WORLDWIDE MANUFACTURER AND MARKETER OF PETROCHEMICALS (CHEMICAL) AND

PARTICIPATES IN ELECTRIC POWER GENERATION (UPSTREAM).

THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN CONFORMITY WITH U.S.

GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES (GAAP) REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO MAKE ESTIMATES THAT AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS, LIABILITIES, REVENUES AND EXPENSES AND THE DISCLOSURE OF CONTINGENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. ACTUAL RESULTS COULD DIFFER

FROM THESE ESTIMATES. PRIOR YEARS DATA HAS BEEN RECLASSIFIED IN CERTAIN CASES TO CONFORM TO THE 2009 PRESENTATION BASIS.

SUBSEQUENT EVENTS HAVE BEEN EVALUATED THROUGH FEBRUARY

26, 2010, THE DATE THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS WERE ISSUED.

1. SUMMARY OF ACCOUNTING POLICIES

PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION.

THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDE THE ACCOUNTS OF THOSE SUBSIDIARIES OWNED DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY WITH MORE

THAN 50 PERCENT OF THE VOTING RIGHTS HELD BY THE CORPORATION AND FOR WHICH OTHER SHAREHOLDERS DO NOT POSSESS THE RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN SIGNIFICANT MANAGEMENT DECISIONS. THEY ALSO INCLUDE THE CORPORATIONS SHARE OF THE UNDIVIDED INTEREST IN

CERTAIN UPSTREAM ASSETS AND LIABILITIES.

AMOUNTS REPRESENTING THE CORPORATIONS PERCENTAGE INTEREST IN THE UNDERLYING

NET ASSETS OF OTHER SUBSIDIARIES AND LESS-THAN-MAJORITY-OWNED COMPANIES IN WHICH A SIGNIFICANT OWNERSHIP PERCENTAGE INTEREST IS HELD ARE INCLUDED IN INVESTMENTS, ADVANCES AND LONG-TERM RECEIVABLES; THE CORPORATIONS SHARE OF THE NET

INCOME OF THESE COMPANIES IS INCLUDED IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF INCOME CAPTION INCOME FROM EQUITY AFFILIATES. THE CORPORATIONS SHARE OF THE CUMULATIVE FOREIGN EXCHANGE TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENT FOR EQUITY METHOD INVESTMENTS IS

REPORTED IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF CHANGES IN EQUITY. EVIDENCE OF LOSS IN VALUE THAT MIGHT INDICATE IMPAIRMENT OF INVESTMENTS IN COMPANIES ACCOUNTED FOR ON THE EQUITY METHOD IS ASSESSED TO DETERMINE IF SUCH EVIDENCE REPRESENTS A LOSS IN VALUE

OF THE CORPORATIONS INVESTMENT THAT IS OTHER THAN TEMPORARY. EXAMPLES OF KEY INDICATORS INCLUDE A HISTORY OF OPERATING LOSSES, A NEGATIVE EARNINGS AND CASH FLOW OUTLOOK, SIGNIFICANT DOWNWARD REVISIONS TO OIL AND GAS RESERVES, AND THE FINANCIAL

CONDITION AND PROSPECTS FOR THE INVESTEES BUSINESS SEGMENT OR GEOGRAPHIC REGION. IF EVIDENCE OF AN OTHER THAN TEMPORARY LOSS IN FAIR VALUE BELOW CARRYING AMOUNT IS DETERMINED, AN IMPAIRMENT IS RECOGNIZED. IN THE ABSENCE OF MARKET PRICES FOR

THE INVESTMENT, DISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS ARE USED TO ASSESS FAIR VALUE.

REVENUE RECOGNITION.

THE CORPORATION GENERALLY SELLS CRUDE OIL,

NATURAL GAS AND PETROLEUM AND CHEMICAL PRODUCTS UNDER SHORT-TERM AGREEMENTS AT PREVAILING MARKET PRICES. IN SOME CASES (E.G., NATURAL GAS), PRODUCTS MAY BE SOLD UNDER LONG-TERM AGREEMENTS, WITH PERIODIC PRICE ADJUSTMENTS. IN ALL CASES, REVENUES ARE

RECOGNIZED WHEN THE PRODUCTS ARE DELIVERED, WHICH OCCURS WHEN THE CUSTOMER HAS TAKEN TITLE AND HAS ASSUMED THE RISKS AND REWARDS OF OWNERSHIP, PRICES ARE FIXED OR DETERMINABLE AND COLLECTIBILITY IS REASONABLY ASSURED.

REVENUES FROM THE PRODUCTION OF NATURAL GAS PROPERTIES IN WHICH THE CORPORATION HAS AN INTEREST WITH OTHER PRODUCERS ARE RECOGNIZED ON THE

BASIS OF THE CORPORATIONS NET WORKING INTEREST. DIFFERENCES BETWEEN ACTUAL PRODUCTION AND NET WORKING INTEREST VOLUMES ARE NOT SIGNIFICANT.

PURCHASES AND SALES OF INVENTORY WITH THE SAME COUNTERPARTY THAT ARE ENTERED INTO IN CONTEMPLATION OF ONE ANOTHER ARE COMBINED AND RECORDED AS EXCHANGES MEASURED AT THE BOOK VALUE OF THE ITEM SOLD.

SALES-BASED TAXES.

THE CORPORATION REPORTS SALES, EXCISE AND VALUE-ADDED TAXES ON SALES TRANSACTIONS ON A GROSS BASIS IN THE

CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF INCOME (INCLUDED IN BOTH REVENUES AND COSTS). THIS GROSS REPORTING BASIS IS FOOTNOTED ON THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF INCOME.

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS.

THE CORPORATION MAKES LIMITED USE OF DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS. THE CORPORATION DOES NOT ENGAGE IN SPECULATIVE DERIVATIVE ACTIVITIES OR DERIVATIVE TRADING ACTIVITIES NOR DOES

IT USE DERIVATIVES WITH LEVERAGED FEATURES. WHEN THE CORPORATION DOES ENTER INTO DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS, IT IS TO OFFSET EXPOSURES ASSOCIATED WITH INTEREST RATES, FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES AND HYDROCARBON PRICES THAT ARISE FROM EXISTING

ASSETS, LIABILITIES AND TRANSACTIONS.

THE GAINS AND LOSSES RESULTING FROM CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF DERIVATIVES ARE

RECORDED IN INCOME. IN SOME CASES, THE CORPORATION DESIGNATES DERIVATIVES AS FAIR VALUE HEDGES, IN WHICH CASE THE GAINS AND LOSSES ARE OFFSET IN INCOME BY THE GAINS AND LOSSES ARISING FROM CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE UNDERLYING HEDGED ITEMS.

INVENTORIES.

CRUDE OIL, PRODUCTS AND MERCHANDISE INVENTORIES ARE CARRIED AT THE LOWER OF CURRENT MARKET VALUE OR COST (GENERALLY

DETERMINED UNDER THE LAST-IN, FIRST-OUT METHOD  LIFO). INVENTORY COSTS INCLUDE EXPENDITURES AND OTHER CHARGES (INCLUDING DEPRECIATION) DIRECTLY AND INDIRECTLY INCURRED IN BRINGING THE INVENTORY TO ITS EXISTING CONDITION AND LOCATION. SELLING

EXPENSES AND GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES ARE REPORTED AS PERIOD COSTS AND EXCLUDED FROM INVENTORY COST. INVENTORIES OF MATERIALS AND SUPPLIES ARE VALUED AT COST OR LESS.

PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT.

DEPRECIATION, DEPLETION AND AMORTIZATION, BASED ON COST LESS ESTIMATED SALVAGE VALUE OF THE ASSET, ARE PRIMARILY DETERMINED UNDER EITHER THE UNIT-OF-PRODUCTION METHOD

OR THE STRAIGHT-LINE METHOD, WHICH IS BASED ON ESTIMATED ASSET SERVICE LIFE TAKING OBSOLESCENCE INTO CONSIDERATION. MAINTENANCE AND REPAIRS, INCLUDING PLANNED MAJOR MAINTENANCE, ARE EXPENSED AS INCURRED. MAJOR RENEWALS AND IMPROVEMENTS ARE

CAPITALIZED AND THE ASSETS REPLACED ARE RETIRED.

INTEREST COSTS INCURRED TO FINANCE EXPENDITURES DURING THE CONSTRUCTION

PHASE OF MULTIYEAR PROJECTS ARE CAPITALIZED AS PART OF THE HISTORICAL COST OF ACQUIRING THE CONSTRUCTED ASSETS. THE PROJECT CONSTRUCTION PHASE COMMENCES WITH THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE DETAILED ENGINEERING DESIGN AND ENDS WHEN THE CONSTRUCTED ASSETS ARE

READY FOR THEIR INTENDED USE. CAPITALIZED INTEREST COSTS ARE INCLUDED IN PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT AND ARE DEPRECIATED OVER THE SERVICE LIFE OF THE RELATED ASSETS.

THE CORPORATION USES THE SUCCESSFUL EFFORTS METHOD TO ACCOUNT FOR ITS EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION ACTIVITIES. UNDER THIS METHOD, COSTS ARE ACCUMULATED ON A FIELD-BY-FIELD BASIS WITH CERTAIN

EXPLORATORY EXPENDITURES AND EXPLORATORY DRY HOLES BEING EXPENSED AS INCURRED. COSTS OF PRODUCTIVE WELLS AND DEVELOPMENT DRY HOLES ARE CAPITALIZED AND AMORTIZED ON THE UNIT-OF-PRODUCTION METHOD.

THE CORPORATION CARRIES AS AN ASSET EXPLORATORY WELL COSTS WHEN THE WELL HAS FOUND A SUFFICIENT QUANTITY OF RESERVES TO JUSTIFY ITS

COMPLETION

TABLE OF CONTENTS

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

AS A PRODUCING WELL AND WHERE THE CORPORATION IS MAKING SUFFICIENT PROGRESS ASSESSING THE RESERVES AND THE ECONOMIC AND OPERATING VIABILITY OF THE PROJECT. EXPLORATORY WELL COSTS NOT MEETING

THESE CRITERIA ARE CHARGED TO EXPENSE.

ACQUISITION COSTS OF PROVED PROPERTIES ARE AMORTIZED USING A UNIT-OF-PRODUCTION

METHOD, COMPUTED ON THE BASIS OF TOTAL PROVED OIL AND GAS RESERVES. SIGNIFICANT UNPROVED PROPERTIES ARE ASSESSED FOR IMPAIRMENT INDIVIDUALLY AND VALUATION ALLOWANCES AGAINST THE CAPITALIZED COSTS ARE RECORDED BASED ON THE ESTIMATED ECONOMIC CHANCE

OF SUCCESS AND THE LENGTH OF TIME THAT THE CORPORATION EXPECTS TO HOLD THE PROPERTIES. THE COST OF PROPERTIES THAT ARE NOT INDIVIDUALLY SIGNIFICANT ARE AGGREGATED BY GROUPS AND AMORTIZED OVER THE AVERAGE HOLDING PERIOD OF THE PROPERTIES OF THE

GROUPS. THE VALUATION ALLOWANCES ARE REVIEWED AT LEAST ANNUALLY. OTHER EXPLORATORY EXPENDITURES, INCLUDING GEOPHYSICAL COSTS, OTHER DRY HOLE COSTS AND ANNUAL LEASE RENTALS, ARE EXPENSED AS INCURRED.

UNIT-OF-PRODUCTION DEPRECIATION IS APPLIED TO PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT, INCLUDING CAPITALIZED EXPLORATORY DRILLING AND DEVELOPMENT

COSTS, ASSOCIATED WITH PRODUCTIVE DEPLETABLE EXTRACTIVE PROPERTIES IN THE UPSTREAM SEGMENT. UNIT-OF-PRODUCTION RATES ARE BASED ON THE AMOUNT OF PROVED DEVELOPED RESERVES OF OIL, GAS AND OTHER MINERALS THAT ARE ESTIMATED TO BE RECOVERABLE FROM

EXISTING FACILITIES USING CURRENT OPERATING METHODS.

UNDER THE UNIT-OF-PRODUCTION METHOD, OIL AND GAS VOLUMES ARE CONSIDERED

PRODUCED ONCE THEY HAVE BEEN MEASURED THROUGH METERS AT CUSTODY TRANSFER OR SALES TRANSACTION POINTS AT THE OUTLET VALVE ON THE LEASE OR FIELD STORAGE TANK.

PRODUCTION COSTS ARE EXPENSED AS INCURRED. PRODUCTION INVOLVES LIFTING THE OIL AND GAS TO THE SURFACE AND GATHERING, TREATING, FIELD PROCESSING AND FIELD STORAGE OF THE OIL AND GAS. THE PRODUCTION

FUNCTION NORMALLY TERMINATES AT THE OUTLET VALVE ON THE LEASE OR FIELD PRODUCTION STORAGE TANK. PRODUCTION COSTS ARE THOSE INCURRED TO OPERATE AND MAINTAIN THE CORPORATIONS WELLS AND RELATED EQUIPMENT AND FACILITIES. THEY BECOME PART OF THE

COST OF OIL AND GAS PRODUCED. THESE COSTS, SOMETIMES REFERRED TO AS LIFTING COSTS, INCLUDE SUCH ITEMS AS LABOR COSTS TO OPERATE THE WELLS AND RELATED EQUIPMENT; REPAIR AND MAINTENANCE COSTS ON THE WELLS AND EQUIPMENT; MATERIALS, SUPPLIES AND ENERGY

COSTS REQUIRED TO OPERATE THE WELLS AND RELATED EQUIPMENT; AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES RELATED TO THE PRODUCTION ACTIVITY.

GAINS ON SALES OF PROVED AND UNPROVED PROPERTIES ARE ONLY RECOGNIZED WHEN THERE IS NO UNCERTAINTY ABOUT THE RECOVERY OF COSTS APPLICABLE TO ANY INTEREST RETAINED OR WHERE THERE IS NO SUBSTANTIAL OBLIGATION FOR FUTURE PERFORMANCE BY THE

CORPORATION. LOSSES ON PROPERTIES SOLD ARE RECOGNIZED WHEN INCURRED OR WHEN THE PROPERTIES ARE HELD FOR SALE AND THE FAIR VALUE OF THE PROPERTIES IS LESS THAN THE CARRYING VALUE.

PROVED OIL AND GAS PROPERTIES HELD AND USED BY THE CORPORATION ARE REVIEWED FOR IMPAIRMENT WHENEVER EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES

INDICATE THAT THE CARRYING AMOUNTS MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE. ASSETS ARE GROUPED AT THE LOWEST LEVEL FOR WHICH THERE ARE IDENTIFIABLE CASH FLOWS THAT ARE LARGELY INDEPENDENT OF THE CASH FLOWS OF OTHER GROUPS OF ASSETS.

THE CORPORATION ESTIMATES THE FUTURE UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS OF THE AFFECTED PROPERTIES TO JUDGE THE RECOVERABILITY OF CARRYING AMOUNTS.

CASH FLOWS USED IN IMPAIRMENT EVALUATIONS ARE DEVELOPED USING ANNUALLY UPDATED CORPORATE PLAN INVESTMENT EVALUATION ASSUMPTIONS FOR CRUDE OIL COMMODITY PRICES AND FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES. ANNUAL VOLUMES ARE BASED ON INDIVIDUAL FIELD

PRODUCTION PROFILES, WHICH ARE ALSO UPDATED ANNUALLY. PRICES FOR NATURAL GAS AND OTHER PRODUCTS ARE BASED ON CORPORATE PLAN ASSUMPTIONS DEVELOPED ANNUALLY BY MAJOR REGION AND ALSO FOR INVESTMENT EVALUATION PURPOSES. CASH FLOW ESTIMATES FOR

IMPAIRMENT TESTING EXCLUDE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS.

IMPAIRMENT ANALYSES ARE GENERALLY BASED ON PROVED RESERVES. WHERE PROBABLE

RESERVES EXIST, AN APPROPRIATELY RISK-ADJUSTED AMOUNT OF THESE RESERVES MAY BE INCLUDED IN THE IMPAIRMENT EVALUATION. IMPAIRMENTS ARE MEASURED BY THE AMOUNT THE CARRYING VALUE EXCEEDS THE FAIR VALUE.

ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS AND ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES.

THE CORPORATION INCURS RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS FOR CERTAIN ASSETS AT THE TIME THEY ARE

INSTALLED. THE FAIR VALUES OF THESE OBLIGATIONS ARE RECORDED AS LIABILITIES ON A DISCOUNTED BASIS. THE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THESE LIABILITIES ARE CAPITALIZED AS PART OF THE RELATED ASSETS AND DEPRECIATED. OVER TIME, THE LIABILITIES ARE ACCRETED FOR

THE CHANGE IN THEIR PRESENT VALUE.

LIABILITIES FOR ENVIRONMENTAL COSTS ARE RECORDED WHEN IT IS PROBABLE THAT OBLIGATIONS HAVE

BEEN INCURRED AND THE AMOUNTS CAN BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED. THESE LIABILITIES ARE NOT REDUCED BY POSSIBLE RECOVERIES FROM THIRD PARTIES AND PROJECTED CASH EXPENDITURES ARE NOT DISCOUNTED.

FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION.

THE CORPORATION SELECTS THE FUNCTIONAL REPORTING CURRENCY FOR ITS INTERNATIONAL SUBSIDIARIES BASED ON THE CURRENCY OF THE PRIMARY ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH EACH

SUBSIDIARY OPERATES. DOWNSTREAM AND CHEMICAL OPERATIONS PRIMARILY USE THE LOCAL CURRENCY. HOWEVER, THE U.S. DOLLAR IS USED IN COUNTRIES WITH A HISTORY OF HIGH INFLATION (PRIMARILY IN LATIN AMERICA) AND SINGAPORE, WHICH PREDOMINANTLY SELLS INTO THE

U.S. DOLLAR EXPORT MARKET. UPSTREAM OPERATIONS WHICH ARE RELATIVELY SELF-CONTAINED AND INTEGRATED WITHIN A PARTICULAR COUNTRY, SUCH AS CANADA, THE UNITED KINGDOM, NORWAY AND CONTINENTAL EUROPE, USE THE LOCAL CURRENCY. SOME UPSTREAM OPERATIONS,

PRIMARILY IN ASIA, WEST AFRICA, RUSSIA AND THE MIDDLE EAST, USE THE U.S. DOLLAR BECAUSE THEY PREDOMINANTLY SELL CRUDE AND NATURAL GAS PRODUCTION INTO U.S. DOLLAR-DENOMINATED MARKETS. FOR ALL OPERATIONS, GAINS OR LOSSES FROM REMEASURING FOREIGN

CURRENCY TRANSACTIONS INTO THE FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY ARE INCLUDED IN INCOME.

SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS.

THE CORPORATION AWARDS SHARE-BASED

COMPENSATION TO EMPLOYEES IN THE FORM OF RESTRICTED STOCK AND RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS. COMPENSATION EXPENSE IS MEASURED BY THE MARKET PRICE OF THE RESTRICTED SHARES AT THE DATE OF GRANT AND IS RECOGNIZED IN THE INCOME STATEMENT OVER THE REQUISITE

SERVICE PERIOD OF EACH AWARD. SEE NOTE 14, INCENTIVE PROGRAM, FOR FURTHER DETAILS.

2. ACCOUNTING CHANGES

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS.

EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2009, EXXONMOBIL ADOPTED THE AUTHORITATIVE GUIDANCE FOR FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS AS

THEY RELATE TO NONFINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES THAT ARE MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE ON A NONRECURRING BASIS. THE GUIDANCE DEFINES FAIR VALUE, ESTABLISHES A FRAMEWORK FOR MEASURING FAIR VALUE WHEN AN ENTITY IS REQUIRED TO USE A FAIR VALUE MEASURE FOR

RECOGNITION OR DISCLOSURE PURPOSES AND EXPANDS THE DISCLOSURES ABOUT FAIR VALUE MEASURES. THE ADOPTION DID NOT HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE CORPORATIONS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. THE CORPORATION PREVIOUSLY ADOPTED THE GUIDANCE AS IT RELATES TO

FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES THAT ARE MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE AND FOR NONFINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES THAT ARE MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE ON A RECURRING BASIS.

NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS.

EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2009, EXXONMOBIL ADOPTED THE AUTHORITATIVE GUIDANCE ON CONSOLIDATION AS IT RELATES TO NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS. THE GUIDANCE CHANGED THE

ACCOUNTING AND REPORTING

68

TABLE OF CONTENTS

INDEX TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

FOR MINORITY INTERESTS, WHICH WERE RECHARACTERIZED AS NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS AND CLASSIFIED AS A COMPONENT OF EQUITY. THE GUIDANCE REQUIRES RETROSPECTIVE ADOPTION OF THE PRESENTATION AND

DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS FOR EXISTING MINORITY INTERESTS. ALL OTHER REQUIREMENTS OF THE GUIDANCE WILL BE APPLIED PROSPECTIVELY. THE ADOPTION OF THE GUIDANCE DID NOT HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE CORPORATIONS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

BUSINESS COMBINATIONS.

EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2009, EXXONMOBIL ADOPTED THE AUTHORITATIVE GUIDANCE FOR BUSINESS COMBINATIONS. THIS GUIDANCE APPLIES

PROSPECTIVELY TO ALL TRANSACTIONS IN WHICH AN ENTITY OBTAINS CONTROL OF ONE OR MORE OTHER BUSINESSES. IN GENERAL, THE GUIDANCE REQUIRES THE ACQUIRING ENTITY IN A BUSINESS COMBINATION TO RECOGNIZE THE FAIR VALUE OF ALL ASSETS ACQUIRED AND LIABILITIES

ASSUMED IN THE TRANSACTION; ESTABLISHES THE ACQUISITION DATE AS THE FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT POINT; AND MODIFIES DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS. IT ALSO MODIFIES THE ACCOUNTING TREATMENT FOR TRANSACTION COSTS BY REQUIRING THAT THESE BE EXPENSED AS INCURRED.

THE ADOPTION OF THE GUIDANCE DID NOT HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE CORPORATIONS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

EARNINGS PER SHARE.

EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2009, EXXONMOBIL ADOPTED THE AUTHORITATIVE GUIDANCE FOR EARNINGS PER SHARE AS IT RELATES TO DETERMINING WHETHER INSTRUMENTS GRANTED IN SHARE-BASED PAYMENT TRANSACTIONS ARE PARTICIPATING SECURITIES. THE GUIDANCE REQUIRES

THAT ALL UNVESTED SHARE-BASED PAYMENT AWARDS THAT CONTAIN NONFORFEITABLE RIGHTS TO DIVIDENDS SHOULD BE INCLUDED IN THE BASIC EARNINGS PER SHARE (EPS) CALCULATION. PRIOR-YEAR EPS NUMBERS HAVE BEEN ADJUSTED RETROSPECTIVELY ON A CONSISTENT BASIS WITH

2009 REPORTING. THIS GUIDANCE DID NOT AFFECT THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL POSITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

OIL AND GAS RESERVES.

EFFECTIVE DECEMBER 31, 2009, EXXONMOBIL ADOPTED THE AUTHORITATIVE GUIDANCE FOR ESTIMATING AND DISCLOSING OIL AND GAS RESERVE QUANTITIES. YEAR-END 2009 PROVED RESERVE VOLUMES AS WELL AS THE 2009 RESERVE CHANGE CATEGORIES WERE CALCULATED

USING AVERAGE PRICES DURING THE 12-MONTH PERIOD. YEAR-END 2008 AND 2007 RESERVE VOLUMES WERE CALCULATED USING DECEMBER 31 PRICES. THE EFFECT ON UNIT-OF-PRODUCTION DEPRECIATION RATES OF USING 12-MONTH AVERAGE VERSUS DECEMBER 31 PRICES WILL

BE APPLIED PROSPECTIVELY COMMENCING IN 2010. ADDITIONALLY, THE DEFINITION OF OIL AND GAS PRODUCING ACTIVITIES HAS BEEN EXPANDED TO INCLUDE BITUMEN EXTRACTED THROUGH MINING ACTIVITIES AND HYDROCARBONS FROM OTHER NON-TRADITIONAL RESOURCES.

THE AMENDED RULES ALSO ADOPTED A RELIABLE TECHNOLOGY DEFINITION THAT PERMITS RESERVES TO BE ADDED BASED ON FIELD-TESTED TECHNOLOGIES. THE ADOPTION OF THIS GUIDANCE IS NOT EXPECTED TO HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE CORPORATIONS CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL POSITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

THE CORPORATION INCURS RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS FOR ITS

UPSTREAM ASSETS. THE FAIR VALUES OF THESE OBLIGATIONS ARE RECORDED AS LIABILITIES ON A DISCOUNTED BASIS, WHICH IS TYPICALLY AT THE TIME THE ASSETS ARE INSTALLED. THE CORPORATION USES ESTIMATES, ASSUMPTIONS AND JUDGMENTS REGARDING SUCH FACTORS AS THE

EXISTENCE OF A LEGAL OBLIGATION FOR AN ARO; TECHNICAL ASSESSMENTS OF THE ASSETS; ESTIMATED AMOUNTS AND TIMING OF SETTLEMENTS; THE CREDIT-ADJUSTED RISK-FREE RATE TO BE USED; AND INFLATION RATES. AROS INCURRED IN THE CURRENT PERIOD WERE LEVEL 3

(UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS) FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS. THE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THESE LIABILITIES ARE CAPITALIZED AS PART OF THE RELATED ASSETS AND DEPRECIATED AS THE RESERVES ARE PRODUCED. OVER TIME, THE LIABILITIES ARE ACCRETED FOR THE CHANGE IN THEIR

PRESENT VALUE. ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS FOR DOWNSTREAM AND CHEMICAL FACILITIES GENERALLY BECOME FIRM AT THE TIME THE FACILITIES ARE PERMANENTLY SHUT DOWN AND DISMANTLED. THESE OBLIGATIONS MAY INCLUDE THE COSTS OF ASSET DISPOSAL AND ADDITIONAL

SOIL REMEDIATION. HOWEVER, THESE SITES HAVE INDETERMINATE LIVES BASED ON PLANS FOR CONTINUED OPERATIONS AND AS SUCH, THE FAIR VALUE OF THE CONDITIONAL LEGAL OBLIGATIONS CANNOT BE MEASURED, SINCE IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO ESTIMATE THE FUTURE SETTLEMENT

DATES OF SUCH OBLIGATIONS.

12. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND DERIVATIVES

THE FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS IS DETERMINED BY REFERENCE TO VARIOUS MARKET DATA AND OTHER VALUATION TECHNIQUES AS APPROPRIATE. THE ESTIMATED FAIR

VALUE OF TOTAL LONG-TERM DEBT, INCLUDING CAPITALIZED LEASE OBLIGATIONS, AT DECEMBER 31, 2009, AND 2008, WAS $7.7 BILLION AND $7.6 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY, AS COMPARED TO RECORDED BOOK VALUES OF $7.1 BILLION AND $7.0 BILLION. THE FAIR VALUE

HIERARCHY FOR LONG-TERM DEBT IS PRIMARILY LEVEL 2 (OBSERVABLE INPUT).

THE CORPORATIONS SIZE, STRONG CAPITAL STRUCTURE,

GEOGRAPHIC DIVERSITY AND THE COMPLEMENTARY NATURE OF THE UPSTREAM, DOWNSTREAM AND CHEMICAL BUSINESSES REDUCE THE CORPORATIONS ENTERPRISE-WIDE RISK FROM CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES, CURRENCY RATES AND COMMODITY PRICES. AS A RESULT, THE

CORPORATION MAKES LIMITED USE OF DERIVATIVES TO MITIGATE THE IMPACT OF SUCH CHANGES. THE CORPORATION DOES NOT ENGAGE IN SPECULATIVE DERIVATIVE ACTIVITIES OR DERIVATIVE TRADING ACTIVITIES NOR DOES IT USE DERIVATIVES WITH LEVERAGED FEATURES. THE

CORPORATION MAINTAINS A SYSTEM OF CONTROLS THAT INCLUDES THE AUTHORIZATION, REPORTING AND MONITORING OF DERIVATIVE ACTIVITY. THE CORPORATIONS LIMITED DERIVATIVE ACTIVITIES POSE NO MATERIAL CREDIT OR MARKET RISKS TO EXXONMOBILS

OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL CONDITION OR LIQUIDITY.

THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF DERIVATIVES OUTSTANDING AND RECORDED ON THE BALANCE

SHEET WAS A NET PAYABLE OF $5 MILLION AT YEAR-END 2009 AND A NET RECEIVABLE OF $118 MILLION AT YEAR-END 2008. THIS IS THE AMOUNT THAT THE CORPORATION WOULD HAVE PAID TO, OR RECEIVED FROM, THIRD PARTIES IF THESE DERIVATIVES HAD BEEN SETTLED IN THE

OPEN MARKET. THE CORPORATION RECOGNIZED A BEFORE-TAX LOSS OF $60 MILLION AND A BEFORE-TAX GAIN OF $89 MILLION AND $66 MILLION RELATED TO DERIVATIVES DURING 2009, 2008 AND 2007, RESPECTIVELY.

THE FAIR VALUE OF DERIVATIVES OUTSTANDING AT YEAR-END 2009 AND LOSS RECOGNIZED DURING THE YEAR ARE IMMATERIAL IN RELATION TO THE

CORPORATIONS YEAR-END CASH BALANCE OF $10.7 BILLION, TOTAL ASSETS OF $233.3 BILLION OR NET INCOME FOR THE YEAR OF $19.3 BILLION.

13. LONG-TERM DEBT

AT DECEMBER 31, 2009, LONG-TERM DEBT CONSISTED OF $6,865 MILLION DUE IN U.S. DOLLARS AND $264 MILLION

REPRESENTING THE U.S. DOLLAR EQUIVALENT AT YEAR-END EXCHANGE RATES OF AMOUNTS PAYABLE IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES. THESE AMOUNTS EXCLUDE THAT PORTION OF LONG-TERM DEBT, TOTALING $348 MILLION, WHICH MATURES WITHIN ONE YEAR AND IS INCLUDED IN CURRENT

LIABILITIES. THE AMOUNTS OF LONG-TERM DEBT MATURING, TOGETHER WITH SINKING FUND PAYMENTS REQUIRED, IN EACH OF THE FOUR YEARS AFTER DECEMBER 31, 2010, IN MILLIONS OF DOLLARS, ARE: 2011  $344, 2012  $2,725, 2013  $160 AND 2014

 $302. AT DECEMBER 31, 2009, THE CORPORATIONS UNUSED LONG-TERM CREDIT LINES WERE NOT MATERIAL.

14. INCENTIVE

PROGRAM

THE 2003 INCENTIVE PROGRAM PROVIDES FOR GRANTS OF STOCK OPTIONS, STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS (SARS), RESTRICTED STOCK AND OTHER

FORMS OF AWARD. AWARDS MAY BE GRANTED TO ELIGIBLE EMPLOYEES OF THE CORPORATION AND THOSE AFFILIATES AT LEAST 50 PERCENT OWNED. OUTSTANDING AWARDS ARE SUBJECT TO CERTAIN FORFEITURE PROVISIONS CONTAINED IN THE PROGRAM OR AWARD INSTRUMENT. THE MAXIMUM

NUMBER OF SHARES OF STOCK THAT MAY BE ISSUED UNDER THE 2003 INCENTIVE PROGRAM IS 220 MILLION. AWARDS THAT ARE FORFEITED OR EXPIRE, OR ARE SETTLED IN CASH, DO NOT COUNT AGAINST THIS MAXIMUM LIMIT. THE 2003 INCENTIVE PROGRAM DOES NOT HAVE A SPECIFIED

TERM. NEW AWARDS MAY BE MADE UNTIL THE AVAILABLE SHARES ARE DEPLETED, UNLESS THE BOARD TERMINATES THE PLAN EARLY. AT THE END OF 2009, REMAINING SHARES AVAILABLE FOR AWARD UNDER THE 2003 INCENTIVE PROGRAM WERE 152,591 THOUSAND.

AS UNDER EARLIER PROGRAMS, OPTIONS AND SARS MAY BE GRANTED AT PRICES NOT LESS THAN 100 PERCENT OF MARKET VALUE ON THE DATE OF GRANT AND HAVE

A MAXIMUM LIFE OF 10 YEARS. MOST OF THE OPTIONS AND SARS NORMALLY FIRST BECOME EXERCISABLE ONE YEAR FOLLOWING THE DATE OF GRANT. ALL REMAINING STOCK OPTIONS AND SARS OUTSTANDING WERE GRANTED PRIOR TO 2002.

LONG-TERM INCENTIVE AWARDS TOTALING 10,133 THOUSAND, 10,116 THOUSAND AND 10,226 THOUSAND OF RESTRICTED (NONVESTED) COMMON

STOCK AND RESTRICTED (NONVESTED) COMMON STOCK UNITS WERE GRANTED IN 2009, 2008 AND 2007, RESPECTIVELY. THESE SHARES ARE ISSUED TO EMPLOYEES FROM TREASURY STOCK. THE TOTAL COMPENSATION EXPENSE IS RECOGNIZED OVER THE REQUISITE SERVICE PERIOD. THE

UNITS THAT ARE SETTLED IN CASH ARE RECORDED AS LIABILITIES AND THEIR CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE ARE RECOGNIZED OVER THE VESTING PERIOD. DURING THE APPLICABLE RESTRICTED PERIODS, THE SHARES MAY NOT BE SOLD OR TRANSFERRED AND ARE SUBJECT TO FORFEITURE. THE

MAJORITY OF THE AWARDS HAVE GRADED VESTING PERIODS, WITH 50 PERCENT OF THE SHARES IN EACH AWARD VESTING AFTER THREE YEARS AND THE REMAINING 50 PERCENT VESTING AFTER SEVEN YEARS. A SMALL NUMBER OF AWARDS GRANTED TO CERTAIN SENIOR EXECUTIVES HAVE

VESTING PERIODS OF FIVE YEARS FOR 50 PERCENT OF THE AWARD AND OF 10 YEARS OR RETIREMENT, WHICHEVER OCCURS LATER, FOR THE REMAINING 50 PERCENT OF THE AWARD.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

INDEX TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

THE CORPORATION HAS PURCHASED SHARES IN THE OPEN MARKET AND THROUGH NEGOTIATED TRANSACTIONS TO OFFSET SHARES

ISSUED IN CONJUNCTION WITH BENEFIT PLANS AND PROGRAMS. PURCHASES MAY BE DISCONTINUED AT ANY TIME WITHOUT PRIOR NOTICE.

IN

2002, THE CORPORATION BEGAN ISSUING RESTRICTED STOCK AS SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION IN LIEU OF STOCK OPTIONS. COMPENSATION EXPENSE FOR THESE AWARDS IS BASED ON THE PRICE OF THE STOCK AT THE DATE OF GRANT AND HAS BEEN RECOGNIZED IN INCOME OVER THE

REQUISITE SERVICE PERIOD. PRIOR TO 2002, THE CORPORATION ISSUED STOCK OPTIONS AS SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION AND SINCE THESE AWARDS VESTED PRIOR TO THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF CURRENT AUTHORITATIVE GUIDANCE, THEY CONTINUE TO BE ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER THE PRIOR

PRESCRIBED METHOD. UNDER THIS METHOD, COMPENSATION EXPENSE FOR AWARDS GRANTED IN THE FORM OF STOCK OPTIONS IS MEASURED AT THE INTRINSIC VALUE OF THE OPTIONS (THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE MARKET PRICE OF THE STOCK AND THE EXERCISE PRICE OF THE OPTIONS)

ON THE DATE OF GRANT. SINCE THESE TWO PRICES WERE THE SAME ON THE DATE OF GRANT, NO COMPENSATION EXPENSE HAS BEEN RECOGNIZED IN INCOME FOR THESE AWARDS.

THE FOLLOWING TABLES SUMMARIZE INFORMATION ABOUT RESTRICTED STOCK AND RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2009.

15. LITIGATION AND OTHER CONTINGENCIES

LITIGATION

A VARIETY OF CLAIMS HAVE BEEN MADE AGAINST EXXONMOBIL AND CERTAIN OF ITS CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES IN A NUMBER OF PENDING LAWSUITS.

MANAGEMENT HAS REGULAR LITIGATION REVIEWS, INCLUDING UPDATES FROM CORPORATE AND OUTSIDE COUNSEL, TO ASSESS THE NEED FOR ACCOUNTING RECOGNITION OR DISCLOSURE OF THESE CONTINGENCIES. THE CORPORATION ACCRUES AN UNDISCOUNTED LIABILITY FOR THOSE

CONTINGENCIES WHERE THE INCURRENCE OF A LOSS IS PROBABLE AND THE AMOUNT CAN BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED. IF A RANGE OF AMOUNTS CAN BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED AND NO AMOUNT WITHIN THE RANGE IS A BETTER ESTIMATE THAN ANY OTHER AMOUNT, THEN THE MINIMUM OF THE

RANGE IS ACCRUED. THE CORPORATION DOES NOT RECORD LIABILITIES WHEN THE LIKELIHOOD THAT THE LIABILITY HAS BEEN INCURRED IS PROBABLE BUT THE AMOUNT CANNOT BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED OR WHEN THE LIABILITY IS BELIEVED TO BE ONLY REASONABLY POSSIBLE OR

REMOTE. FOR CONTINGENCIES WHERE AN UNFAVORABLE OUTCOME IS REASONABLY POSSIBLE AND WHICH ARE SIGNIFICANT, THE CORPORATION DISCLOSES THE NATURE OF THE CONTINGENCY AND, WHERE FEASIBLE, AN ESTIMATE OF THE POSSIBLE LOSS. EXXONMOBIL WILL CONTINUE TO

DEFEND ITSELF VIGOROUSLY IN THESE MATTERS. BASED ON A CONSIDERATION OF ALL RELEVANT FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES, THE CORPORATION DOES NOT BELIEVE THE ULTIMATE OUTCOME OF ANY CURRENTLY PENDING LAWSUIT AGAINST EXXONMOBIL WILL HAVE A MATERIALLY ADVERSE

EFFECT UPON THE CORPORATIONS OPERATIONS OR FINANCIAL CONDITION.

A NUMBER OF LAWSUITS, INCLUDING CLASS ACTIONS, WERE

BROUGHT IN VARIOUS COURTS AGAINST EXXON MOBIL CORPORATION AND CERTAIN OF ITS SUBSIDIARIES RELATING TO THE ACCIDENTAL RELEASE OF CRUDE OIL FROM THE TANKER EXXON VALDEZ IN 1989. ALL THE COMPENSATORY CLAIMS AND THE PUNITIVE DAMAGE AWARD HAVE BEEN PAID.

OTHER CONTINGENCIES

IN ACCORDANCE WITH A NATIONALIZATION DECREE ISSUED BY VENEZUELAS PRESIDENT IN FEBRUARY 2007, BY MAY 1, 2007, A SUBSIDIARY OF THE VENEZUELAN NATIONAL OIL COMPANY (PDVSA) ASSUMED THE OPERATORSHIP OF THE CERRO NEGRO HEAVY OIL

PROJECT. THIS PROJECT HAD BEEN OPERATED AND OWNED BY EXXONMOBIL AFFILIATES HOLDING A 41.67 PERCENT OWNERSHIP INTEREST IN THE PROJECT. THE DECREE ALSO REQUIRED CONVERSION OF THE CERRO NEGRO PROJECT INTO A MIXED ENTERPRISE AND AN INCREASE

IN PDVSAS OR ONE OF ITS AFFILIATES OWNERSHIP INTEREST IN THE PROJECT, WITH THE STIPULATION THAT IF EXXONMOBIL REFUSED TO ACCEPT THE TERMS FOR THE FORMATION OF THE MIXED ENTERPRISE WITHIN A SPECIFIED PERIOD OF TIME, THE GOVERNMENT WOULD

DIRECTLY ASSUME THE ACTIVITIES CARRIED OUT BY THE JOINT VENTURE. EXXONMOBIL REFUSED TO ACCEDE TO THE TERMS PROFFERED BY THE GOVERNMENT, AND ON JUNE 27, 2007, THE GOVERNMENT EXPROPRIATED EXXONMOBILS 41.67 PERCENT INTEREST IN

THE CERRO NEGRO PROJECT.

ON SEPTEMBER 6, 2007, AFFILIATES OF EXXONMOBIL FILED A REQUEST FOR ARBITRATION WITH THE

INTERNATIONAL CENTRE FOR SETTLEMENT OF INVESTMENT DISPUTES. AN AFFILIATE OF EXXONMOBIL HAS ALSO FILED AN ARBITRATION UNDER THE RULES OF THE INTERNATIONAL CHAMBER OF COMMERCE AGAINST PDVSA AND A PDVSA AFFILIATE FOR BREACH OF THEIR CONTRACTUAL

OBLIGATIONS UNDER CERTAIN CERRO NEGRO PROJECT AGREEMENTS. BOTH ARBITRATION PROCEEDINGS CONTINUE. AT THIS TIME, THE NET IMPACT OF THIS MATTER ON THE CORPORATIONS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL RESULTS CANNOT BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED. HOWEVER, THE

CORPORATION DOES NOT EXPECT THE RESOLUTION TO HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT UPON THE CORPORATIONS OPERATIONS OR FINANCIAL CONDITION. EXXONMOBILS REMAINING NET BOOK INVESTMENT IN CERRO NEGRO PRODUCING ASSETS IS ABOUT $750 MILLION.

FOR 2009 AND 2008, OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS PAID ARE NET OF $28 MILLION AND $26 MILLION OF MEDICARE SUBSIDY RECEIPTS, RESPECTIVELY.

FOR U.S. PLANS, THE DISCOUNT RATE IS DETERMINED BY CONSTRUCTING A PORTFOLIO OF HIGH-QUALITY, NONCALLABLE BONDS WITH CASH

FLOWS THAT MATCH ESTIMATED OUTFLOWS FOR BENEFIT PAYMENTS. FOR MAJOR NON-U.S. PLANS, THE DISCOUNT RATE IS DETERMINED BY USING BOND PORTFOLIOS WITH AN AVERAGE MATURITY APPROXIMATING THAT OF THE LIABILITIES OR SPOT YIELD CURVES, BOTH OF WHICH ARE

CONSTRUCTED USING HIGH-QUALITY, LOCAL-CURRENCY-DENOMINATED BONDS.

THE MEASUREMENT OF THE ACCUMULATED POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT

OBLIGATION ASSUMES AN INITIAL HEALTH CARE COST TREND RATE OF 6.5 PERCENT THAT DECLINES TO 4.5 PERCENT BY 2015. A ONE-PERCENTAGE-POINT INCREASE IN THE HEALTH CARE COST TREND RATE WOULD INCREASE SERVICE AND INTEREST COST BY $50 MILLION AND THE

POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATION BY $532 MILLION. A ONE-PERCENTAGE-POINT DECREASE IN THE HEALTH CARE COST TREND RATE WOULD DECREASE SERVICE AND INTEREST COST BY $40 MILLION AND THE POST-RETIREMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATION BY $442 MILLION.

THE LONG-TERM EXPECTED RATE OF RETURN ON FUNDED ASSETS SHOWN BELOW IS ESTABLISHED FOR EACH BENEFIT PLAN

BY DEVELOPING A FORWARD-LOOKING, LONG-TERM RETURN ASSUMPTION FOR EACH ASSET CLASS, TAKING INTO ACCOUNT FACTORS SUCH AS THE EXPECTED REAL RETURN FOR THE SPECIFIC ASSET CLASS AND INFLATION.

A SINGLE, LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN IS THEN CALCULATED AS THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE OF THE TARGET ASSET ALLOCATION AND THE LONG-TERM RETURN ASSUMPTION FOR EACH

ASSET CLASS.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

INDEX TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

THE CORPORATIONS INVESTMENT STRATEGY FOR BENEFIT PLAN ASSETS REFLECTS A LONG-TERM VIEW, A CAREFUL

ASSESSMENT OF THE RISKS INHERENT IN VARIOUS ASSET CLASSES AND BROAD DIVERSIFICATION TO REDUCE THE RISK OF THE PORTFOLIO. THE BENEFIT PLAN ASSETS ARE PRIMARILY INVESTED IN PASSIVE EQUITY AND FIXED INCOME INDEX FUNDS TO DIVERSIFY RISK WHILE MINIMIZING

COSTS. THE EQUITY FUNDS HOLD EXXONMOBIL STOCK ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO REPLICATE THE RELEVANT EQUITY INDEX. THE FIXED INCOME FUNDS ARE LARGELY INVESTED IN HIGH-QUALITY CORPORATE AND GOVERNMENT DEBT SECURITIES.

STUDIES ARE PERIODICALLY CONDUCTED TO ESTABLISH THE PREFERRED TARGET ASSET ALLOCATION. THE TARGET ASSET ALLOCATION FOR THE U.S. BENEFIT

PLANS IS 60% EQUITY SECURITIES AND 40% DEBT SECURITIES. THE TARGET ASSET ALLOCATION FOR THE NON-U.S. PLANS IN AGGREGATE IS 56% EQUITIES, 41% DEBT AND 3% REAL ESTATE FUNDS. THE EQUITY TARGETS FOR THE U.S. AND NON-U.S. PLANS INCLUDE AN ALLOCATION TO

PRIVATE EQUITY PARTNERSHIPS THAT PRIMARILY FOCUS ON EARLY-STAGE VENTURE CAPITAL OF 5% AND 3%, RESPECTIVELY.

THE AUTHORITATIVE

GUIDANCE FOR FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS PROVIDES A FRAMEWORK FOR MEASURING FAIR VALUE. THE FRAMEWORK ESTABLISHES A THREE-LEVEL FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY BASED ON THE NATURE OF THE INFORMATION USED TO MEASURE FAIR VALUE. THE TERMS LEVEL 1,

LEVEL 2 AND LEVEL 3 ARE ACCOUNTING TERMS THAT REFER TO DIFFERENT METHODS OF VALUING ASSETS. THE TERMS DO NOT REPRESENT THE RELATIVE RISK OR CREDIT QUALITY OF AN INVESTMENT.

17. DISCLOSURES ABOUT SEGMENTS AND RELATED INFORMATION

THE UPSTREAM, DOWNSTREAM AND CHEMICAL FUNCTIONS BEST DEFINE THE OPERATING SEGMENTS OF THE BUSINESS THAT ARE REPORTED SEPARATELY. THE FACTORS USED TO IDENTIFY

THESE REPORTABLE SEGMENTS ARE BASED ON THE NATURE OF THE OPERATIONS THAT ARE UNDERTAKEN BY EACH SEGMENT. THE UPSTREAM SEGMENT IS ORGANIZED AND OPERATES TO EXPLORE FOR AND PRODUCE CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS. THE DOWNSTREAM SEGMENT IS ORGANIZED AND

OPERATES TO MANUFACTURE AND SELL PETROLEUM PRODUCTS. THE CHEMICAL SEGMENT IS ORGANIZED AND OPERATES TO MANUFACTURE AND SELL PETROCHEMICALS. THESE SEGMENTS ARE BROADLY UNDERSTOOD ACROSS THE PETROLEUM AND PETROCHEMICAL INDUSTRIES.

THESE FUNCTIONS HAVE BEEN DEFINED AS THE OPERATING SEGMENTS OF THE CORPORATION BECAUSE THEY ARE THE SEGMENTS (1) THAT ENGAGE IN

BUSINESS ACTIVITIES FROM WHICH REVENUES ARE EARNED AND EXPENSES ARE INCURRED; (2) WHOSE OPERATING RESULTS ARE REGULARLY REVIEWED BY THE CORPORATIONS CHIEF OPERATING DECISION MAKER TO MAKE DECISIONS ABOUT RESOURCES TO BE ALLOCATED TO THE

SEGMENT AND ASSESS ITS PERFORMANCE; AND (3) FOR WHICH DISCRETE FINANCIAL INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE.

EARNINGS AFTER INCOME

TAX INCLUDE SPECIAL ITEMS, AND TRANSFERS ARE AT ESTIMATED MARKET PRICES. EARNINGS FOR 2009 INCLUDED A SPECIAL CHARGE OF $140 MILLION IN THE CORPORATE AND FINANCING SEGMENT FOR INTEREST RELATED TO THE VALDEZ PUNITIVE DAMAGES AWARD. SPECIAL ITEMS

INCLUDED IN 2008 AFTER-TAX EARNINGS WERE A $1,620 MILLION GAIN IN NON-U.S. UPSTREAM ON THE SALE OF A NATURAL GAS TRANSPORTATION BUSINESS IN GERMANY AND SPECIAL CHARGES OF $460 MILLION IN THE CORPORATE AND FINANCING SEGMENT RELATED TO THE VALDEZ

LITIGATION. THERE WERE NO SPECIAL ITEMS IN 2007.

INTEREST EXPENSE INCLUDES NON-DEBT-RELATED INTEREST EXPENSE OF $500 MILLION,

$498 MILLION AND $290 MILLION IN 2009, 2008 AND 2007, RESPECTIVELY. HIGHER EXPENSES IN 2009 AND 2008 PRIMARILY REFLECT INTEREST PROVISIONS RELATED TO THE VALDEZ LITIGATION.

IN CORPORATE AND FINANCING ACTIVITIES, INTEREST REVENUE RELATES TO INTEREST EARNED ON CASH DEPOSITS AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES.

THE CORPORATION HAD $42 BILLION OF INDEFINITELY

REINVESTED, UNDISTRIBUTED EARNINGS FROM SUBSIDIARY COMPANIES OUTSIDE THE U.S. UNRECOGNIZED DEFERRED TAXES ON REMITTANCE OF THESE FUNDS ARE NOT EXPECTED TO BE MATERIAL.

UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS

EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2007, THE CORPORATION ADOPTED THE

AUTHORITATIVE GUIDANCE FOR ACCOUNTING FOR UNCERTAINTY IN INCOME TAXES. UPON THE ADOPTION OF THIS GUIDANCE, THE CORPORATION RECOGNIZED A TRANSITION GAIN OF $267 MILLION IN EQUITY. THE GAIN REFLECTED THE RECOGNITION OF SEVERAL REFUND CLAIMS, PARTLY

OFFSET BY INCREASED LIABILITY RESERVES.

THE CORPORATION IS SUBJECT TO INCOME TAXATION IN MANY JURISDICTIONS AROUND THE WORLD.

UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS REFLECT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN POSITIONS TAKEN OR EXPECTED TO BE TAKEN ON INCOME TAX RETURNS AND THE AMOUNTS RECOGNIZED IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. RESOLUTION OF THE RELATED TAX POSITIONS THROUGH NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE

RELEVANT TAX AUTHORITIES OR THROUGH LITIGATION WILL TAKE MANY YEARS TO COMPLETE. IT IS DIFFICULT TO PREDICT THE TIMING OF RESOLUTION FOR INDIVIDUAL TAX POSITIONS SINCE SUCH TIMING IS NOT ENTIRELY WITHIN THE CONTROL OF THE CORPORATION. HOWEVER, IT IS

REASONABLY POSSIBLE THAT RESOLUTIONS COULD BE REACHED WITH TAX JURISDICTIONS WITHIN THE NEXT 12 MONTHS THAT COULD RESULT IN A DECREASE OF UP TO 15 PERCENT IN THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS. GIVEN THE LONG TIME PERIODS INVOLVED IN

RESOLVING INDIVIDUAL TAX POSITIONS, THE CORPORATION DOES NOT EXPECT THAT THE RECOGNITION OF UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS WILL HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE CORPORATIONS EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE IN ANY GIVEN YEAR.

OIL AND GAS RESERVES

THE

FOLLOWING INFORMATION DESCRIBES CHANGES DURING THE YEARS AND BALANCES OF PROVED OIL AND GAS RESERVES AT YEAR-END 2007, 2008 AND 2009.

THE DEFINITIONS USED ARE IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSIONS AMENDED RULE 4-10 (A) OF REGULATION S-X.

PROVED OIL AND GAS RESERVES ARE THOSE QUANTITIES OF OIL AND GAS, WHICH, BY ANALYSIS OF GEOSCIENCE AND ENGINEERING DATA, CAN BE ESTIMATED WITH REASONABLE CERTAINTY TO BE ECONOMICALLY PRODUCIBLE  FROM

A GIVEN DATE FORWARD, FROM KNOWN RESERVOIRS, AND UNDER EXISTING ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, OPERATING METHODS AND GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS  PRIOR TO THE TIME AT WHICH CONTRACTS PROVIDING THE RIGHT TO OPERATE EXPIRE, UNLESS EVIDENCE INDICATES THAT

RENEWAL IS REASONABLY CERTAIN. IN SOME CASES, SUBSTANTIAL NEW INVESTMENTS IN ADDITIONAL WELLS AND RELATED FACILITIES WILL BE REQUIRED TO RECOVER THESE PROVED RESERVES.

IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSIONS AMENDED RULES, THE YEAR-END RESERVES VOLUMES FOR 2009 AS WELL AS THE RESERVES CHANGE CATEGORIES FOR 2009 SHOWN IN THE FOLLOWING TABLES WERE

CALCULATED USING AVERAGE PRICES DURING THE 12-MONTH PERIOD PRIOR TO THE ENDING DATE OF THE PERIOD COVERED BY THE REPORT, DETERMINED AS AN UNWEIGHTED ARITHMETIC AVERAGE OF THE FIRST-DAY-OF-THE-MONTH PRICE FOR EACH MONTH WITHIN SUCH PERIOD. THE

YEAR-END RESERVES VOLUMES FOR 2007 AND 2008 AS WELL AS THE RESERVES CHANGE CATEGORIES FOR 2007 AND 2008 SHOWN IN THE FOLLOWING TABLES WERE CALCULATED USING DECEMBER 31 PRICES AND COSTS. THESE RESERVES QUANTITIES ARE ALSO USED IN CALCULATING

UNIT-OF-PRODUCTION DEPRECIATION RATES AND IN CALCULATING THE STANDARDIZED MEASURE OF DISCOUNTED NET CASH FLOW.

REVISIONS CAN

INCLUDE UPWARD OR DOWNWARD CHANGES IN PREVIOUSLY ESTIMATED VOLUMES OF PROVED RESERVES FOR EXISTING FIELDS DUE TO THE EVALUATION OR RE-EVALUATION OF (1) ALREADY AVAILABLE GEOLOGIC, RESERVOIR OR PRODUCTION DATA, (2) NEW GEOLOGIC, RESERVOIR

OR PRODUCTION DATA OR (3) CHANGES IN AVERAGE PRICES AND YEAR-END COSTS THAT ARE USED IN THE ESTIMATION OF RESERVES. THIS CATEGORY CAN ALSO INCLUDE SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN EITHER DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY OR PRODUCTION EQUIPMENT/ FACILITY CAPACITY.

PROVED RESERVES INCLUDE 100 PERCENT OF EACH MAJORITY-OWNED AFFILIATES PARTICIPATION IN PROVED RESERVES AND

EXXONMOBILS OWNERSHIP PERCENTAGE OF THE PROVED RESERVES OF EQUITY COMPANIES, BUT EXCLUDE ROYALTIES AND QUANTITIES DUE OTHERS. GAS RESERVES EXCLUDE THE GASEOUS EQUIVALENT OF LIQUIDS EXPECTED TO BE REMOVED FROM THE GAS ON LEASES, AT FIELD

FACILITIES AND AT GAS PROCESSING PLANTS. THESE LIQUIDS ARE INCLUDED IN NET PROVED RESERVES OF CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS LIQUIDS.

IN THE PROVED RESERVES TABLES, CONSOLIDATED RESERVES AND EQUITY COMPANY RESERVES ARE REPORTED SEPARATELY. HOWEVER, THE CORPORATION DOES NOT VIEW EQUITY COMPANY RESERVES ANY DIFFERENTLY THAN THOSE FROM CONSOLIDATED COMPANIES.

RESERVES REPORTED UNDER PRODUCTION SHARING AND OTHER NONCONCESSIONARY AGREEMENTS ARE BASED ON THE ECONOMIC INTEREST AS DEFINED BY THE

SPECIFIC FISCAL TERMS IN THE AGREEMENT. THE PRODUCTION AND RESERVES THAT WE REPORT FOR THESE TYPES OF ARRANGEMENTS TYPICALLY VARY INVERSELY WITH OIL AND GAS PRICE CHANGES. AS OIL AND GAS PRICES INCREASE, THE CASH FLOW AND VALUE RECEIVED BY THE

COMPANY INCREASE; HOWEVER, THE PRODUCTION VOLUMES AND RESERVES REQUIRED TO ACHIEVE THIS VALUE WILL TYPICALLY BE LOWER BECAUSE OF THE HIGHER PRICES. WHEN PRICES DECREASE, THE OPPOSITE EFFECT GENERALLY OCCURS. THE PERCENTAGE OF TOTAL LIQUIDS AND

NATURAL GAS PROVED RESERVES (CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES PLUS EQUITY COMPANIES) AT YEAR-END 2009 THAT WERE ASSOCIATED WITH PRODUCTION SHARING CONTRACT ARRANGEMENTS WAS 17 PERCENT OF LIQUIDS, 13 PERCENT OF NATURAL GAS AND 15 PERCENT ON AN

OIL-EQUIVALENT BASIS (GAS CONVERTED TO OIL-EQUIVALENT AT 6 BILLION CUBIC FEET = 1 MILLION BARRELS).

NET PROVED DEVELOPED

RESERVES ARE THOSE VOLUMES THAT ARE EXPECTED TO BE RECOVERED THROUGH EXISTING WELLS WITH EXISTING EQUIPMENT AND OPERATING METHODS OR IN WHICH THE COST OF THE REQUIRED EQUIPMENT IS RELATIVELY MINOR COMPARED TO THE COST OF A NEW WELL. NET PROVED

UNDEVELOPED RESERVES ARE THOSE VOLUMES THAT ARE EXPECTED TO BE RECOVERED FROM NEW WELLS ON UNDRILLED ACREAGE, OR FROM EXISTING WELLS WHERE A RELATIVELY MAJOR EXPENDITURE IS REQUIRED FOR RECOMPLETION.

CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS LIQUIDS AND NATURAL GAS PRODUCTION QUANTITIES SHOWN ARE THE NET VOLUMES WITHDRAWN FROM EXXONMOBILS OIL AND

GAS RESERVES. THE NATURAL GAS QUANTITIES DIFFER FROM THE QUANTITIES OF GAS DELIVERED FOR SALE BY THE PRODUCING FUNCTION AS REPORTED IN THE OPERATING SUMMARY DUE TO VOLUMES CONSUMED OR FLARED AND INVENTORY CHANGES.

STANDARDIZED MEASURE OF DISCOUNTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS

AS REQUIRED BY THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD, THE STANDARDIZED MEASURE OF DISCOUNTED FUTURE NET CASH FLOWS WAS COMPUTED THROUGH 2008 BY APPLYING

YEAR-END PRICES, COSTS AND LEGISLATED TAX RATES AND A DISCOUNT FACTOR OF 10 PERCENT TO NET PROVED RESERVES. BEGINNING IN 2009, THE STANDARDIZED MEASURE OF DISCOUNTED FUTURE NET CASH FLOW IS COMPUTED BY APPLYING FIRST-DAY-OF-THE-MONTH AVERAGE PRICES,

YEAR-END COSTS AND LEGISLATED TAX RATES AND A DISCOUNT FACTOR OF 10 PERCENT TO PROVED RESERVES. THE STANDARDIZED MEASURE INCLUDES COSTS FOR FUTURE DISMANTLEMENT, ABANDONMENT AND REHABILITATION OBLIGATIONS. THE CORPORATION BELIEVES THE STANDARDIZED

MEASURE DOES NOT PROVIDE A RELIABLE ESTIMATE OF THE CORPORATIONS EXPECTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS TO BE OBTAINED FROM THE DEVELOPMENT AND PRODUCTION OF ITS OIL AND GAS PROPERTIES OR OF THE VALUE OF ITS PROVED OIL AND GAS RESERVES. THE STANDARDIZED

MEASURE IS PREPARED ON THE BASIS OF CERTAIN PRESCRIBED ASSUMPTIONS INCLUDING FIRST-DAY-OF-THE-MONTH AVERAGE PRICES, WHICH REPRESENT DISCRETE POINTS IN TIME AND THEREFORE MAY CAUSE SIGNIFICANT VARIABILITY IN CASH FLOWS FROM YEAR TO YEAR AS PRICES

CHANGE.

SPECIFIC ITEMS TO ASSESS MATERIALITY.

IN ASSESSING MATERIALITY FOR THIS PURPOSE, INFORMATION WILL BE CONSIDERED MATERIAL IF, IN LIGHT OF ALL

THE CIRCUMSTANCES, THERE IS A SUBSTANTIAL LIKELIHOOD A REASONABLE INVESTOR WOULD CONSIDER THE INFORMATION IMPORTANT IN DECIDING WHETHER TO BUY OR SELL EXXONMOBIL STOCK OR IN DECIDING HOW TO VOTE SHARES OF EXXONMOBIL STOCK. A DIRECTOR WILL ABSTAIN

FROM THE DECISION ON ANY TRANSACTIONS INVOLVING THAT DIRECTOR OR HIS OR HER IMMEDIATE FAMILY MEMBERS.

UNDER SEC RULES, CERTAIN TRANSACTIONS

ARE DEEMED NOT TO INVOLVE A MATERIAL INTEREST (INCLUDING TRANSACTIONS IN WHICH THE AMOUNT INVOLVED IN ANY 12-MONTH PERIOD IS LESS THAN $120,000 AND TRANSACTIONS WITH ENTITIES WHERE A RELATED PERSONS INTEREST IS LIMITED TO SERVICE AS A

NON-EMPLOYEE DIRECTOR). IN ADDITION BASED ON A CONSIDERATION OF EXXONMOBILS FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES, THE COMMITTEE WILL PRESUME THAT THE FOLLOWING TRANSACTIONS DO NOT INVOLVE A MATERIAL INTEREST FOR PURPOSES OF REPORTING UNDER SEC RULES.



TRANSACTIONS IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS WITH AN ENTITY FOR WHICH A RELATED PERSON SERVES AS AN EXECUTIVE OFFICER,

PROVIDED

(1) THE

AFFECTED DIRECTOR OR EXECUTIVE OFFICER DID NOT PARTICIPATE IN THE DECISION ON THE PART OF EXXONMOBIL TO ENTER INTO SUCH TRANSACTIONS; AND, (2) THE AMOUNT INVOLVED IN ANY RELATED CATEGORY OF TRANSACTIONS IN A 12-MONTH PERIOD IS LESS THAN 1

PERCENT OF THE ENTITYS GROSS REVENUES.



GRANTS OR MEMBERSHIP PAYMENTS IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS TO NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS,

PROVIDED

(1) THE AFFECTED DIRECTOR OR

EXECUTIVE OFFICER DID NOT PARTICIPATE IN THE DECISION ON THE PART OF EXXONMOBIL TO MAKE SUCH PAYMENTS; AND, (2) THE AMOUNT OF GENERAL-PURPOSE GRANTS IN A 12-MONTH PERIOD IS LESS THAN 1 PERCENT OF THE RECIPIENTS GROSS REVENUES.



PAYMENTS UNDER EXXONMOBIL PLANS AND ARRANGEMENTS THAT ARE AVAILABLE GENERALLY TO U.S. SALARIED EMPLOYEES (INCLUDING CONTRIBUTIONS UNDER THE EXXONMOBIL

FOUNDATIONS EDUCATIONAL AND CULTURAL MATCHING GIFT PROGRAMS AND PAYMENTS TO PROVIDERS UNDER EXXONMOBIL HEALTH CARE PLANS).



EMPLOYMENT BY EXXONMOBIL OF A FAMILY MEMBER OF AN EXECUTIVE OFFICER,

PROVIDED

THE EXECUTIVE OFFICER DOES NOT PARTICIPATE IN DECISIONS REGARDING

THE HIRING, PERFORMANCE EVALUATION, OR COMPENSATION OF THE FAMILY MEMBER.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

INDEX TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

TRANSACTIONS OR RELATIONSHIPS NOT COVERED BY THE ABOVE STANDARDS WILL BE ASSESSED BY THE COMMITTEE ON THE

BASIS OF THE SPECIFIC FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES.

THE FOLLOWING DISCLOSURES ARE MADE AS OF FEBRUARY 24, 2010, THE DATE OF THE MOST RECENT

BOARD AFFAIRS COMMITTEE REVIEW OF POTENTIAL RELATED PERSON TRANSACTIONS.

EXXONMOBIL AND ITS AFFILIATES HAVE ABOUT 81,000 EMPLOYEES AROUND THE

WORLD AND EMPLOYEES RELATED BY BIRTH OR MARRIAGE MAY BE FOUND AT ALL LEVELS OF THE ORGANIZATION. THE SPOUSE OF T.R. WALTERS, A VICE PRESIDENT OF THE CORPORATION, RETIRED FROM EXXONMOBIL IN 2009. EXCLUDING PENSION AND OTHER RETIREMENT-RELATED

DISTRIBUTIONS, HER PARTIAL-YEAR COMPENSATION WAS LESS THAN $120,000.

EXXONMOBIL EMPLOYEES DO NOT RECEIVE PREFERENTIAL TREATMENT BY REASON OF

BEING RELATED TO AN EXECUTIVE OFFICER, AND EXECUTIVE OFFICERS DO NOT PARTICIPATE IN HIRING, PERFORMANCE EVALUATION, OR COMPENSATION DECISIONS FOR FAMILY MEMBERS. EXXONMOBILS EMPLOYMENT GUIDELINES STATE: RELATIVES OF COMPANY EMPLOYEES MAY

BE EMPLOYED ON A NON-PREFERENTIAL BASIS. HOWEVER AN EMPLOYEE SHOULD NOT BE EMPLOYED BY OR ASSIGNED TO WORK UNDER THE DIRECT SUPERVISION OF A RELATIVE, OR TO REPORT TO A SUPERVISOR WHO IN TURN REPORTS TO A RELATIVE OF THE EMPLOYEE. ACCORDINGLY,

CONSISTENT WITH EXXONMOBILS RELATED PERSON TRANSACTION GUIDELINES, WE DO NOT CONSIDER THE RELATIONSHIP NOTED ABOVE TO BE MATERIAL WITHIN THE MEANING OF THE RELATED PERSON TRANSACTION DISCLOSURE RULES.

P.T. MULVA (VICE PRESIDENT AND CONTROLLER) HAS A BROTHER CURRENTLY SERVING AS CHAIRMAN AND CEO OF CONOCOPHILLIPS. AS IS THE CASE WITH MOST OTHER MAJOR

COMPANIES IN THE OIL AND GAS INDUSTRY, EXXONMOBIL HAS A VARIETY OF BUSINESS TRANSACTIONS WITH CONOCOPHILLIPS. THESE TRANSACTIONS INCLUDE ROUTINE PURCHASES AND SALES OF CRUDE OIL, PETROLEUM PRODUCTS, AND PIPELINE TRANSPORTATION CAPACITY. AFFILIATES

OF EXXONMOBIL AND CONOCOPHILLIPS HAVE JOINT OWNERSHIP OF A REFINERY IN GERMANY AND A NUMBER OF PIPELINES, TERMINALS, EMERGENCY RESPONSE COMPANIES, AND SERVICE COMPANIES, AND ALSO HAVE UNDIVIDED INTERESTS IN A VARIETY OF EXPLORATION, DEVELOPMENT, AND

PRODUCTION PROJECTS. ALL OF THESE TRANSACTIONS ARE ENTERED INTO IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS WITHOUT INFLUENCE FROM P.T. MULVA. NEITHER P.T. MULVA NOR, TO OUR KNOWLEDGE AFTER REASONABLE INQUIRY, HIS BROTHER, HAS ANY INTEREST IN THESE

TRANSACTIONS DIFFERENT FROM THE GENERAL INTEREST OF OTHER EMPLOYEES AND SHAREHOLDERS. ACCORDINGLY, CONSISTENT WITH EXXONMOBILS RELATED PERSON TRANSACTION GUIDELINES, WE DO NOT CONSIDER THESE TRANSACTIONS TO BE MATERIAL WITHIN THE MEANING OF

THE RELATED PERSON TRANSACTION DISCLOSURE RULES.

S.R. LASALA (RETIRED VICE PRESIDENT AND GENERAL TAX COUNSEL) HAS A SON WHO IS A PARTNER OF A

LAW FIRM THAT PERFORMS WORK FOR EXXONMOBIL. MR. LASALA IS NOT INVOLVED IN DECISIONS TO RETAIN THE FIRM, AND, THEREFORE, WE DO NOT CONSIDER THE RELATIONSHIP TO BE MATERIAL WITHIN THE MEANING OF THE RELATED PERSON TRANSACTION DISCLOSURE RULES.

S.J. GLASS, JR. (VICE PRESIDENT) HAS A BROTHER WHO IS A PARTNER OF A LAW FIRM THAT PERFORMS WORK FOR EXXONMOBIL. MR. GLASS IS NOT

INVOLVED IN DECISIONS TO RETAIN THE FIRM, AND, THEREFORE, WE DO NOT CONSIDER THE RELATIONSHIP TO BE MATERIAL WITHIN THE MEANING OF THE RELATED PERSON TRANSACTION DISCLOSURE RULES.

THE BOARD AFFAIRS COMMITTEE ALSO REVIEWED EXXONMOBILS ORDINARY COURSE BUSINESS WITH COMPANIES FOR WHICH NON-EMPLOYEE DIRECTORS SERVE AS EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AND DETERMINED THAT, IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE

CATEGORICAL STANDARDS DESCRIBED ABOVE, NONE OF THOSE MATTERS REPRESENT REPORTABLE RELATED PERSON TRANSACTIONS. SEE DIRECTOR INDEPENDENCE ON PAGE 109.

WE ARE NOT AWARE OF ANY RELATED PERSON TRANSACTION REQUIRED TO BE REPORTED UNDER APPLICABLE SEC RULES SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THE LAST FISCAL YEAR WHERE OUR POLICIES AND PROCEDURES DID NOT REQUIRE REVIEW,

OR WHERE SUCH POLICIES AND PROCEDURES WERE NOT FOLLOWED.

THE CORPORATIONS RELATED PERSON TRANSACTION GUIDELINES ARE INTENDED TO ASSIST

THE CORPORATION IN COMPLYING WITH ITS DISCLOSURE OBLIGATIONS UNDER SEC RULES. THESE PROCEDURES ARE IN ADDITION TO, NOT IN LIEU OF, THE CORPORATIONS CODE OF ETHICS AND BUSINESS CONDUCT.

DIRECTOR COMPENSATION

DIRECTOR COMPENSATION ELEMENTS ARE DESIGNED TO.

ENSURE ALIGNMENT WITH LONG-TERM SHAREHOLDER INTERESTS;



ENSURE THE COMPANY CAN ATTRACT AND RETAIN OUTSTANDING DIRECTOR CANDIDATES WHO MEET THE SELECTION CRITERIA OUTLINED IN THE GUIDELINES FOR SELECTION OF

NON-EMPLOYEE DIRECTORS, WHICH CAN BE FOUND ON THE CORPORATE GOVERNANCE SECTION OF OUR WEB SITE;



RECOGNIZE THE SUBSTANTIAL TIME COMMITMENTS NECESSARY TO OVERSEE THE AFFAIRS OF THE CORPORATION; AND,



SUPPORT THE INDEPENDENCE OF THOUGHT AND ACTION EXPECTED OF DIRECTORS.

NON-EMPLOYEE DIRECTOR COMPENSATION LEVELS ARE REVIEWED BY THE BOARD AFFAIRS COMMITTEE EACH YEAR, AND RESULTING RECOMMENDATIONS ARE PRESENTED TO THE FULL BOARD FOR APPROVAL. THE COMMITTEE USES AN

INDEPENDENT CONSULTANT, PEARL MEYER & PARTNERS, TO PROVIDE INFORMATION ON CURRENT DEVELOPMENTS AND PRACTICES IN DIRECTOR COMPENSATION. PEARL MEYER & PARTNERS IS THE SAME CONSULTANT RETAINED BY THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE TO ADVISE

ON EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION, BUT PERFORMS NO OTHER WORK FOR EXXONMOBIL.

EXXONMOBIL EMPLOYEES RECEIVE NO ADDITIONAL PAY FOR SERVING AS

DIRECTORS.

THE ANNUAL CASH RETAINER FOR NON-EMPLOYEE DIRECTORS IS $100,000 PER YEAR. CHAIRS OF THE AUDIT AND COMPENSATION COMMITTEES AND THE PRESIDING DIRECTOR

INDEX TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

AUDIT-RELATED FEES

THE AGGREGATE FEES FOR PWC AUDIT-RELATED SERVICES RENDERED TO EXXONMOBIL FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2009, WERE $5.4 MILLION (VERSUS $6.1 MILLION IN 2008). THESE SERVICES WERE MAINLY RELATED TO

ASSET DISPOSITIONS, BENEFIT PLAN AND JOINT VENTURE AUDITS, AND ATTESTATION PROCEDURES RELATED TO COST CERTIFICATIONS.

TAX FEES

THE AGGREGATE FEES FOR PWC TAX SERVICES RENDERED TO EXXONMOBIL FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2009, WERE $1.9 MILLION (VERSUS $4.0

MILLION FOR 2008). THESE SERVICES ARE DESCRIBED BELOW.



PWC ASSISTED VARIOUS EXXONMOBIL AFFILIATES WITH THE PREPARATION OF LOCAL TAX FILINGS AND RELATED TAX SERVICES. THESE FEES WERE $1.6 MILLION FOR 2009

(VERSUS $1.4 MILLION IN 2008).



PWC ALSO ASSISTED IN PREPARING TAX RETURNS FOR INDIVIDUAL EXXONMOBIL EXPATRIATE EMPLOYEES. THESE FEES WERE $0.3 MILLION FOR 2009 (VERSUS $2.6 MILLION

FOR 2008). THE TRANSITION OF TAX RETURN PREPARATION ASSISTANCE TO ANOTHER SERVICE PROVIDER IS UNDER WAY.

ALL OTHER FEES

THE AGGREGATE FEES FOR PWC SERVICES RENDERED TO EXXONMOBIL, OTHER THAN THE SERVICES DESCRIBED ABOVE UNDER AUDIT FEES,

AUDIT-RELATED FEES, AND TAX FEES, FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2009, WERE ZERO (ALSO ZERO IN 2008).

PWC

HAS BEEN EXXONMOBILS INDEPENDENT AUDITING FIRM FOR MANY YEARS, AND WE BELIEVE THEY ARE WELL-QUALIFIED FOR THE JOB. A PWC REPRESENTATIVE WILL BE AT THE ANNUAL MEETING TO ANSWER APPROPRIATE QUESTIONS AND TO MAKE A STATEMENT IF HE DESIRES.

COMPENSATION COMMITTEE REPORT

ANNUAL REPORT

ON FORM 10-K

OVERVIEW

PROVIDING ENERGY TO MEET THE WORLDS DEMANDS IS A COMPLEX BUSINESS. WE MEET THIS CHALLENGE BY TAKING A LONG-TERM VIEW RATHER THAN REACTING TO SHORT-TERM BUSINESS CYCLES. THE COMPENSATION PROGRAM OF

EXXONMOBIL ALIGNS WITH AND SUPPORTS THE LONG-TERM BUSINESS FUNDAMENTALS AND CORE BUSINESS STRATEGIES OUTLINED BELOW AND ILLUSTRATED IN THE MODEL ON PAGE 123.

BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT



LONG INVESTMENT HORIZONS;



LARGE CAPITAL INVESTMENTS;



WORLDWIDE DIVERSE RESOURCES AND MARKETS; AND,



COMMODITY-BASED, CYCLICAL PRODUCT PRICES.

KEY BUSINESS STRATEGIES



LONG-TERM GROWTH IN SHAREHOLDER VALUE;



DISCIPLINED, SELECTIVE, AND LONG-TERM FOCUS IN MAKING INVESTMENTS;



OPERATIONAL EXCELLENCE; AND,



INDUSTRY-LEADING RETURNS ON CAPITAL AND SUPERIOR CASH FLOW.

KEY ELEMENTS OF THE COMPENSATION PROGRAM

THE KEY ELEMENTS OF OUR

COMPENSATION PROGRAM AND STAFFING OBJECTIVES THAT SUPPORT THE BUSINESS FUNDAMENTALS AND STRATEGIES ARE.



LONG-TERM

CAREER ORIENTATION

WITH HIGH INDIVIDUAL PERFORMANCE STANDARDS (SEE PAGE 124);



BASE

SALARY

THAT REWARDS INDIVIDUAL EXPERIENCE AND PERFORMANCE (SEE PAGE 124);



ANNUAL

BONUS

GRANTS BASED ON BUSINESS PERFORMANCE, AS WELL AS INDIVIDUAL EXPERIENCE AND PERFORMANCE (SEE PAGES 124-125);



PAYMENT OF A LARGE PORTION OF EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION IN THE FORM OF

EQUITY

WITH LONG MANDATORY HOLDING PERIODS

THAT EXTEND BEYOND

RETIREMENT

(SEE PAGES 125-127); AND,



RETIREMENT

BENEFITS (PENSION AND SAVINGS PLANS) THAT PROVIDE FOR FINANCIAL SECURITY AFTER EMPLOYMENT (SEE PAGE 128).

OTHER SUPPORTING COMPENSATION AND STAFFING PRACTICES



EXECUTIVES ARE AT-WILL EMPLOYEES OF THE COMPANY. THEY

DO NOT HAVE EMPLOYMENT CONTRACTS

,

A SEVERANCE PROGRAM, OR ANY

BENEFITS TRIGGERED BY A CHANGE IN CONTROL.



A STRONG PROGRAM OF

MANAGEMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUCCESSION PLANNING

IS IN PLACE TO REINFORCE A CAREER ORIENTATION AND PROVIDE CONTINUITY

OF LEADERSHIP.



WE DO NOT BELIEVE THAT OUR COMPENSATION POLICIES AND PRACTICES CREATE ANY MATERIAL ADVERSE RISKS FOR THE COMPANY.

INAPPROPRIATE RISK-TAKING IS

DISCOURAGED

BY REQUIRING SENIOR EXECUTIVES TO HOLD A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF THEIR EQUITY INCENTIVE AWARD FOR THEIR ENTIRE CAREER

AND

BEYOND RETIREMENT. THESE LENGTHY HOLDING PERIODS ARE TAILORED TO OUR BUSINESS MODEL. FURTHERMORE,

PAYOUT OF 50 PERCENT OF THE ANNUAL BONUS IS DELAYED AND SUBJECT TO RISK OF FORFEITURE. THE TIMING OF THE PAYOUT IS DETERMINED BY EARNINGS PERFORMANCE.

121

TABLE OF CONTENTS

INDEX TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS



ALL U.S. EXECUTIVES, INCLUDING THE CEO, THE OTHER NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS, AND ABOUT 1,200 OTHER U.S. EXECUTIVES, PARTICIPATE IN

COMMON

PROGRAMS

(THE SAME SALARY, INCENTIVE, AND RETIREMENT PROGRAMS). WITHIN THESE PROGRAMS, THE COMPENSATION OF EXECUTIVES IS DIFFERENTIATED BASED ON INDIVIDUAL EXPERIENCE, LEVEL OF RESPONSIBILITY, AND PERFORMANCE ASSESSMENT.



NO TAX ASSISTANCE

IS PROVIDED BY THE COMPANY ON ANY ELEMENTS OF EXECUTIVE OFFICER COMPENSATION OR PERQUISITES OTHER THAN RELOCATION. THE

RELOCATION POLICY IS A BROAD-BASED PROGRAM THAT APPLIES TO ALL TRANSFERRED U.S. PROFESSIONAL AND EXECUTIVE EMPLOYEES.



SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNTS OF EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION ARE AT

RISK OF FORFEITURE

IN CASE OF DETRIMENTAL ACTIVITY, UNAPPROVED EARLY TERMINATION, OR

MATERIAL NEGATIVE RESTATEMENT OF FINANCIAL OR OPERATING RESULTS.



THE COMPANY

DOES NOT REPRICE EQUITY INCENTIVE AWARDS

. THE UTILIZATION OF RESTRICTED STOCK INSTEAD OF STOCK OPTIONS AND THE DETERMINATION

OF ANNUAL GRANTS ON A SHARE-DENOMINATED VERSUS PRICE BASIS HELP REINFORCE THIS PRACTICE.



EQUITY COMPENSATION IS NOT INCLUDED IN PENSION CALCULATIONS.

BUSINESS PERFORMANCE AND BASIS FOR COMPENSATION DECISIONS



COMPENSATION DECISIONS ARE BASED ON THE RESULTS ACHIEVED IN THE FOLLOWING AREAS OVER MULTIPLE YEAR PERIODS.



TOTAL SHAREHOLDER RETURN;



EARNINGS;



RETURN ON CAPITAL EMPLOYED;



CASH RETURNED TO SHAREHOLDERS;



SAFETY, HEALTH, AND ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE;



OPERATING PERFORMANCE OF THE UPSTREAM, DOWNSTREAM, AND CHEMICAL SEGMENTS;



BUSINESS CONTROLS; AND,



EFFECTIVENESS OF ACTIONS THAT SUPPORT THE LONG-TERM, STRATEGIC DIRECTION OF THE COMPANY.



THE

DECISION-MAKING PROCESS

WITH RESPECT TO COMPENSATION REQUIRES JUDGMENT, TAKING INTO ACCOUNT BUSINESS AND INDIVIDUAL PERFORMANCE AND

RESPONSIBILITY.

QUANTITATIVE TARGETS OR FORMULAS ARE NOT USED

TO ASSESS INDIVIDUAL PERFORMANCE OR DETERMINE THE AMOUNT OF COMPENSATION. THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE ASSESSES THE RESULTS DESCRIBED ABOVE AGAINST A BROAD RANGE OF GOALS AND

OBJECTIVES AND TAKES INTO CONSIDERATION MULTIPLE EXTERNAL FACTORS THAT INFLUENCE THESE RESULTS.

KEY CHANGES FOR NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS IN 2009



BONUS AWARDS TO THE NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS IN 2009 WERE REDUCED BY AMOUNTS RANGING FROM 32 TO 40 PERCENT VERSUS 2008.



EQUITY AWARDS WERE GRANTED IN THE FORM OF RESTRICTED STOCK IN 2009. THE NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS WERE GRANTED THE SAME NUMBER OF SHARES AS IN 2008,

EXCEPT FOR MR. DOLAN, WHOSE GRANT WAS INCREASED. THE GRANT DATE FAIR VALUE OF EACH RESTRICTED SHARE FOR THE 2009 GRANT WAS 4 PERCENT LOWER VERSUS 2008.

INDEX TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

KEY ELEMENTS OF THE COMPENSATION PROGRAM

CAREER ORIENTATION



IT IS OUR OBJECTIVE TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN FOR A CAREER THE BEST TALENT AVAILABLE.



IT TAKES A LONG PERIOD OF TIME AND A SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT TO DEVELOP THE EXPERIENCED EXECUTIVE TALENT NECESSARY TO SUCCEED IN THE OIL AND GAS

BUSINESS; SENIOR EXECUTIVES MUST HAVE EXPERIENCE WITH ALL PHASES OF THE BUSINESS CYCLE TO BE EFFECTIVE LEADERS.



CAREER ORIENTATION AMONG A DEDICATED AND HIGHLY SKILLED WORKFORCE, COMBINED WITH THE HIGHEST PERFORMANCE STANDARDS, CONTRIBUTES TO THE COMPANYS

LEADERSHIP IN THE INDUSTRY AND SERVES THE INTERESTS OF SHAREHOLDERS IN THE LONG TERM.



THE LONG COMPANY SERVICE OF EXECUTIVE OFFICERS REFLECTS THIS STRATEGY AT ALL LEVELS OF THE ORGANIZATION.



THE NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS HAVE CAREER SERVICE RANGING FROM 29 TO OVER 38 YEARS.



THE OTHER EXECUTIVE OFFICERS OF THE CORPORATION HAVE CAREER SERVICE RANGING FROM 28 TO OVER 38 YEARS.



CONSISTENT WITH OUR LONG-TERM CAREER ORIENTATION, HIGH-PERFORMING EXECUTIVES TYPICALLY EARN SUBSTANTIALLY HIGHER LEVELS OF COMPENSATION IN THE FINAL

YEARS OF THEIR CAREERS THAN IN THE EARLIER YEARS.



THIS PAY PRACTICE REINFORCES THE IMPORTANCE OF A LONG-TERM FOCUS IN MAKING DECISIONS THAT ARE KEY TO BUSINESS SUCCESS.



BECAUSE THE COMPENSATION PROGRAM EMPHASIZES INDIVIDUAL EXPERIENCE AND LONG-TERM PERFORMANCE, EXECUTIVES HOLDING SIMILAR POSITIONS MAY RECEIVE

SUBSTANTIALLY DIFFERENT LEVELS OF COMPENSATION.

SALARY



SALARIES PROVIDE EXECUTIVES WITH A BASE LEVEL OF INCOME.



THE LEVEL OF ANNUAL SALARY IS BASED ON THE EXECUTIVES RESPONSIBILITY, PERFORMANCE ASSESSMENT, AND CAREER EXPERIENCE.



SALARY DECISIONS DIRECTLY AFFECT THE LEVEL OF RETIREMENT BENEFITS SINCE SALARY IS INCLUDED IN RETIREMENT-BENEFIT FORMULAS. THE LEVEL OF RETIREMENT

BENEFITS IS, THEREFORE, PERFORMANCE-BASED LIKE OTHER ELEMENTS OF COMPENSATION.

BONUS



THE 2009 ANNUAL BONUS POOL WAS $139 MILLION VERSUS $232 MILLION IN 2008, A DECREASE OF 40 PERCENT. THIS REFLECTS THE COMBINED VALUE AT GRANT OF CASH

AND EARNINGS BONUS UNITS.



THE ANNUAL BONUS PROGRAM IS HIGHLY VARIABLE DEPENDING ON ANNUAL FINANCIAL AND OPERATING RESULTS.



THE SIZE OF THE ANNUAL BONUS POOL IS BASED ON THE ANNUAL EARNINGS OF THE COMPANY AND OTHER BUSINESS PERFORMANCE FACTORS AS DESCRIBED UNDER

BUSINESS RESULTS CONSIDERED ON PAGE 131.



IN SETTING THE SIZE OF THE ANNUAL BONUS POOL AND INDIVIDUAL EXECUTIVE AWARDS, THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE.



SECURES INPUT FROM THE CHAIRMAN ON THE PERFORMANCE OF THE COMPANY AND FROM THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEES EXTERNAL CONSULTANT REGARDING COMPENSATION

TRENDS ACROSS INDUSTRIES.

124

TABLE OF CONTENTS

INDEX TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS



USES JUDGMENT TO DETERMINE THE OVERALL SIZE OF THE ANNUAL BONUS POOL, TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION THE CYCLICAL NATURE AND LONG-TERM ORIENTATION OF THE

BUSINESS.



TO RECOGNIZE THE CYCLICAL NATURE OF THE COMMODITIES BUSINESS IN WHICH WE OPERATE AND THE LONG-TERM ORIENTATION OF OUR BUSINESS MODEL, THE ANNUAL BONUS

POOL AND INDIVIDUAL GRANTS ARE MANAGED TO RECOGNIZE ONLY A PORTION OF THE CHANGE IN ANNUAL EARNINGS PERFORMANCE BOTH ON THE UPSIDE AND DOWNSIDE. FOR EXAMPLE, WHEN EARNINGS INCREASE, THE FULL PERCENTAGE CHANGE IN EARNINGS IS NOT REFLECTED IN THE

BONUS POOL. THE SIZE OF THE INDIVIDUAL AWARDS WITHIN THE BONUS POOL IS DIFFERENTIATED AMONG PARTICIPANTS BASED ON INDIVIDUAL PERFORMANCE ASSESSMENTS, EXPERIENCE, AND LEVEL OF RESPONSIBILITY.



THE ANNUAL BONUS PROGRAM INCORPORATES UNIQUE ELEMENTS TO FURTHER REINFORCE RETENTION AND RECOGNIZE PERFORMANCE. AWARDS UNDER THIS PROGRAM ARE GENERALLY

DELIVERED AS.



EARNINGS BONUS UNITS ARE CASH AWARDS THAT ARE TIED TO FUTURE CUMULATIVE EARNINGS PER SHARE. EARNINGS BONUS UNITS PAY OUT WHEN A SPECIFIED LEVEL OF

CUMULATIVE EARNINGS PER SHARE IS ACHIEVED OR WITHIN THREE YEARS AT A REDUCED LEVEL.



FOR BONUS AWARDS GRANTED IN 2009, THE TRIGGER OR CUMULATIVE EARNINGS PER SHARE REQUIRED FOR PAYOUT OF THE DELAYED PORTION IS $5.75 PER UNIT, WHICH IS

THE SAME AS 2008.



IF CUMULATIVE EARNINGS PER SHARE DO NOT REACH $5.75 WITHIN THREE YEARS, THE DELAYED PORTION OF THE BONUS WOULD BE REDUCED TO AN AMOUNT EQUAL TO THE

NUMBER OF UNITS TIMES THE ACTUAL CUMULATIVE EARNINGS PER SHARE OVER THE PERIOD.



THE INTENT OF THE EARNINGS PER SHARE TRIGGER IS TO TIE THE TIMING OF THE BONUS PAYMENT TO THE RATE OF THE CORPORATIONS FUTURE EARNINGS AND NOT TO

DECREASE THE AMOUNT OF THE PAYMENT, ALTHOUGH IT IS AT RISK OF FORFEITURE AS DESCRIBED BELOW. THUS THE TRIGGER OF $5.75 IS INTENTIONALLY SET AT A LEVEL THAT IS EXPECTED TO BE ACHIEVED WITHIN THE THREE-YEAR PERIOD.



PRIOR TO PAYMENT, THE DELAYED PORTION OF A BONUS MAY BE FORFEITED IF THE EXECUTIVE LEAVES THE COMPANY BEFORE THE STANDARD RETIREMENT AGE, OR ENGAGES IN

ACTIVITY THAT IS DETRIMENTAL TO THE COMPANY.



CASH AND EARNINGS BONUS UNIT PAYMENTS ARE SUBJECT TO

RECOUPMEN

T

IN THE EVENT OF MATERIAL NEGATIVE RESTATEMENT OF THE

CORPORATIONS REPORTED FINANCIAL OR OPERATING RESULTS. EVEN THOUGH A RESTATEMENT IS UNLIKELY GIVEN EXXONMOBILS HIGH ETHICAL STANDARDS AND STRICT COMPLIANCE WITH ACCOUNTING AND OTHER REGULATIONS APPLICABLE TO PUBLIC COMPANIES, A RECOUPMENT

POLICY WAS APPROVED BY THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS TO REINFORCE THE WELL-UNDERSTOOD PHILOSOPHY THAT INCENTIVE AWARDS ARE AT RISK OF FORFEITURE AND THAT

HOW

WE ACHIEVE RESULTS IS AS IMPORTANT AS THE ACTUAL RESULTS.

EQUITY



EQUITY COMPENSATION ACCOUNTS FOR A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF TOTAL COMPENSATION TO ALIGN THE PERSONAL FINANCIAL INTERESTS OF EXECUTIVES WITH THE LONG-TERM

INTERESTS OF SHAREHOLDERS.



IT IS THE OBJECTIVE TO GRANT 50 TO 70 PERCENT OF A SENIOR EXECUTIVES TOTAL COMPENSATION IN THE FORM OF RESTRICTED STOCK AS MEASURED BY GRANT DATE

FAIR MARKET VALUE, AS DESCRIBED BEGINNING ON PAGE 133.



THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE MAKES GRANT DECISIONS ON A SHARE-DENOMINATED BASIS RATHER THAN A PRICE BASIS. THE COMMITTEE DOES NOT SUPPORT A PRACTICE OF

OFFSETTING THE LOSS OR GAIN OF PRIOR

125

TABLE OF CONTENTS

INDEX TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

RESTRICTED STOCK GRANTS BY THE VALUE OF CURRENT YEAR GRANTS. THIS PRACTICE WOULD MINIMIZE THE RISK/REWARD PROFILE OF EQUITY-BASED AWARDS AND UNDERMINE THE LONG-TERM VIEW THAT EXECUTIVES ARE

EXPECTED TO ADOPT.



THE CORPORATION ALSO COMPARES THE TOTAL VALUE OF RESTRICTED STOCK GRANTS AGAINST THE COMBINED VALUE OF ALL FORMS OF LONG TERM AWARDS BY COMPARATOR

COMPANIES THROUGH AN ANNUAL BENCHMARKING PROCESS, AND MAKES ADJUSTMENTS AS NECESSARY (SEE PAGE 129).

RATIONALE



GIVEN THE LONG-TERM ORIENTATION OF OUR BUSINESS, GRANTING EQUITY IN THE FORM OF RESTRICTED STOCK WITH LONG VESTING PROVISIONS KEEPS EXECUTIVES FOCUSED

ON THE FUNDAMENTAL PREMISE THAT DECISIONS MADE CURRENTLY AFFECT THE PERFORMANCE OF THE CORPORATION AND COMPANY STOCK MANY YEARS INTO THE FUTURE.



LONG RESTRICTED STOCK VESTING PERIODS THAT EXTEND BEYOND RETIREMENT SUPPORT A LONG-TERM RISK/REWARD PROFILE THAT ALIGNS WITH UNDERLYING BUSINESS

FUNDAMENTALS AND

DISCOURAGES INAPPROPRIATE RISK TAKING.



THE LONG RESTRICTION PERIODS REINFORCE THE COMPANYS FOCUS ON GROWING SHAREHOLDER VALUE OVER THE LONG TERM BY SUBJECTING A LARGE PERCENTAGE OF

EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION AND PERSONAL NET WORTH TO THE LONG-TERM RETURN ON EXXONMOBIL STOCK REALIZED BY SHAREHOLDERS.



RESTRICTED STOCK REMOVES EMPLOYEE DISCRETION ON THE SALE OF COMPANY-GRANTED STOCK HOLDINGS AND REINFORCES THE RETENTION OBJECTIVES OF THE COMPENSATION

PROGRAM.

RESTRICTION PERIODS



THE RESTRICTION PERIODS FOR EXXONMOBILS STOCK GRANTS TO THE MOST SENIOR EXECUTIVES ARE AMONG THE LONGEST OF PUBLIC COMPANIES.



50 PERCENT OF EACH GRANT IS RESTRICTED FOR FIVE YEARS; AND,



THE BALANCE IS RESTRICTED FOR 10 YEARS OR UNTIL RETIREMENT,

WHICHEVER IS LATER.



FOR THE MOST SENIOR EXECUTIVES, MORE THAN HALF OF THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF RESTRICTED STOCK

MAY NOT BE SOLD OR TRANSFERRED UNTIL AFTER THE EXECUTIVE

RETIRES.



THE RESTRICTED PERIOD FOR STOCK AWARDS IS NOT SUBJECT TO ACCELERATION, EXCEPT IN THE CASE OF DEATH.

FORFEITURE RISK AND HEDGING POLICY



RESTRICTED STOCK IS SUBJECT TO FORFEITURE IF AN EXECUTIVE.



LEAVES THE COMPANY BEFORE STANDARD RETIREMENT TIME (DEFINED AS AGE 65 FOR U.S. EMPLOYEES). IN THE EVENT OF EARLY RETIREMENT PRIOR TO THE AGE OF 65

(I.E., AGE 55 TO 64), THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE MUST APPROVE THE RETENTION OF AWARDS BY AN EXECUTIVE OFFICER.



ENGAGES IN ACTIVITY THAT IS DETRIMENTAL TO THE COMPANY, EVEN IF SUCH ACTIVITY OCCURS OR IS DISCOVERED AFTER RETIREMENT.



COMPANY POLICY PROHIBITS ALL EMPLOYEES, INCLUDING EXECUTIVES, FROM ENTERING INTO PUT OR CALL OPTIONS ON EXXONMOBIL COMMON STOCK OR FUTURES CONTRACTS ON

OIL OR GAS.

SHARE UTILIZATION



THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE ESTABLISHES A CEILING EACH YEAR FOR ANNUAL STOCK AWARDS. THE OVERALL NUMBER OF SHARES GRANTED IN THE RESTRICTED STOCK

PROGRAM IN 2009 REPRESENTS DILUTION OF 0.2 PERCENT, WHICH IS WELL BELOW THE AVERAGE OF THE OTHER LARGE U.S.-BASED COMPANIES BENCHMARKED FOR COMPENSATION AND INCENTIVE PROGRAM PURPOSES BASED ON HISTORICAL GRANT PATTERNS.



THE COMPANY HAS A LONG-ESTABLISHED PRACTICE OF PURCHASING SHARES IN THE MARKETPLACE TO ELIMINATE THE DILUTIVE EFFECT OF STOCK-BASED INCENTIVE AWARDS.

126

TABLE OF CONTENTS

INDEX TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

PRIOR STOCK PROGRAMS



ALL EQUITY AWARDS GRANTED SINCE 2003 ARE GRANTED UNDER THE CORPORATIONS 2003 INCENTIVE PROGRAM. ALL EQUITY-BASED AWARDS (INCLUDING STOCK OPTIONS

AND RESTRICTED STOCK) GRANTED PRIOR TO 2003 THAT REMAIN OUTSTANDING WERE GRANTED UNDER THE CORPORATIONS 1993 INCENTIVE PROGRAM (OTHER THAN AWARDS GRANTED BY MOBIL CORPORATION PRIOR TO THE MERGER). NO FURTHER GRANTS CAN BE MADE UNDER THE 1993

INCENTIVE PROGRAM.



PRIOR TO 2002, EXXONMOBIL GRANTED CAREER SHARES TO THE COMPANYS MOST SENIOR EXECUTIVES.



CAREER SHARES VEST THE YEAR FOLLOWING AN EXECUTIVES RETIREMENT AND ARE SUBJECT TO FORFEITURE ON SUBSTANTIALLY THE SAME TERMS AS CURRENT GRANTS OF RESTRICTED

STOCK. THE LONG VESTING PERIOD FURTHER ALIGNS THE PERSONAL FINANCIAL INTERESTS OF EXECUTIVES WITH THE LONG-TERM INTERESTS OF SHAREHOLDERS, AND HELPS EXXONMOBIL RETAIN SENIOR EXECUTIVES FOR THE DURATION OF THEIR CAREERS.



THE CORPORATION CEASED GRANTING CAREER SHARES IN 2002 WHEN THE CORPORATION BEGAN GRANTING RESTRICTED STOCK TO THE BROADER EXECUTIVE POPULATION IN LIEU OF STOCK OPTIONS.



RESTRICTED STOCK AND LONG MANDATORY HOLDING PERIODS ACHIEVE THE SAME OBJECTIVES AS CAREER SHARES, AND, THEREFORE, IT IS UNNECESSARY TO GRANT BOTH CAREER SHARES AND THE

CURRENT FORM OF RESTRICTED STOCK.



CAREER SHARES COULD BE GRANTED AGAIN IN THE FUTURE UNDER THE CORPORATIONS 2003 INCENTIVE PROGRAM, BUT THERE ARE NO CURRENT PLANS TO MAKE SUCH GRANTS.



BEFORE THE MERGER, MOBIL CORPORATION GRANTED RETENTION AWARDS UNDER THE FORMER MOBIL CORPORATION MANAGEMENT RETENTION PLAN. RETENTION AWARDS ARE STOCK

UNITS THAT SETTLE IN CASH IN A SINGLE LUMP SUM PAYMENT AS SOON AS PRACTICABLE AFTER RETIREMENT (TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE REQUIRED SIX-MONTH DELAY IN PAYMENT REQUIRED UNDER THE AMERICAN JOBS CREATION ACT OF 2004). MESSRS. CRAMER AND PRYOR HAVE

OUTSTANDING RETENTION AWARDS.

STOCK OWNERSHIP



THE TABLE BELOW SHOWS STOCK OWNERSHIP AS A MULTIPLE OF SALARY AND THE PERCENTAGE OF SHARES THAT ARE STILL SUBJECT TO RESTRICTIONS FOR THE NAMED

EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AND THE AVERAGE FOR ALL OTHER EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AS OF YEAR-END 2009. VALUATION FOR THIS PURPOSE IS BASED ON THE YEAR-END STOCK PRICE. THESE LEVELS OF OWNERSHIP ENSURE EXECUTIVE OFFICERS HAVE A SIGNIFICANT STAKE IN THE SUSTAINABLE

LONG-TERM SUCCESS OF THE CORPORATION.

RETIREMENT

COMMON PROGRAMS



SENIOR EXECUTIVES PARTICIPATE IN THE SAME TAX-QUALIFIED PENSION AND SAVINGS PLANS AS MOST OTHER U.S. EMPLOYEES. SENIOR EXECUTIVES ALSO PARTICIPATE IN

THE SAME NONQUALIFIED DEFINED BENEFIT AND DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLANS AS OTHER U.S. EXECUTIVES.



A KEY PRINCIPLE ON WHICH THE PENSION AND SAVINGS PROGRAMS ARE BASED IS COMMONALITY OF DESIGN FOR ALL EMPLOYEES, EXCEPT WHERE THE AMERICAN JOBS CREATION

ACT OF 2004 REQUIRES DELAYED TIMING OF NONQUALIFIED PLAN DISTRIBUTIONS FOR HIGHER-LEVEL EXECUTIVES. THE SAME PRINCIPLE OF COMMONALITY APPLIES TO THE COMPANY HEALTH CARE BENEFITS (SEE PAGE 146).

PENSION PLANS



THE TAX-QUALIFIED AND NONQUALIFIED PENSION PLANS, DESCRIBED IN MORE DETAIL BEGINNING ON PAGE 143, PROVIDE AN ANNUAL BENEFIT OF 1.6 PERCENT OF FINAL

AVERAGE PAY PER YEAR OF SERVICE, WITH AN OFFSET FOR SOCIAL SECURITY BENEFITS.



PAY FOR THE PURPOSE OF PENSION CALCULATIONS INCLUDES BASE SALARY AND BONUS BUT DOES NOT INCLUDE EQUITY COMPENSATION.



BONUS INCLUDES THE AMOUNTS THAT ARE PAID AT GRANT AND THE AMOUNTS DELAYED BY THE COMPANY, AS DESCRIBED BEGINNING ON PAGE 124.



THE PORTION OF ANNUAL BONUS SUBJECT TO DELAYED PAYMENT IS EXPECTED TO PAY OUT SUBJECT TO FORFEITURE PROVISIONS AND THEREFORE IS INCLUDED FOR PENSION

PURPOSES IN THE YEAR OF GRANT RATHER THAN THE YEAR OF PAYMENT, AS DESCRIBED ON PAGE 144.



PENSION BENEFITS ARE PAID UPON RETIREMENT AS FOLLOWS.



QUALIFIED PENSION PLAN BENEFITS ARE PAYABLE, AT THE ELECTION OF THE EMPLOYEE, IN A LUMP SUM OR IN ONE OF VARIOUS FORMS OF ANNUITY PAYMENTS.



NONQUALIFIED PENSION PLAN BENEFITS ARE PAID IN THE FORM OF AN EQUIVALENT LUMP SUM SIX MONTHS AFTER RETIREMENT.

QUALIFIED SAVINGS PLAN



THE QUALIFIED SAVINGS PLAN DESCRIBED ON PAGE 139 PERMITS EMPLOYEES TO MAKE PRE- OR POST-TAX CONTRIBUTIONS AND RECEIVE A COMPANY-MATCHING CONTRIBUTION

OF 7 PERCENT OF ELIGIBLE SALARY, SUBJECT TO INTERNAL REVENUE CODE (CODE) LIMITS ON THE AMOUNT OF PAY TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT AND THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF CONTRIBUTIONS.



TO RECEIVE THE COMPANY-MATCHING CONTRIBUTION, EMPLOYEES MUST CONTRIBUTE A MINIMUM OF 6 PERCENT OF SALARY.



QUALIFIED BENEFITS ARE PAYABLE IN A SINGLE LUMP SUM OR IN PARTIAL WITHDRAWALS AT ANY TIME AFTER RETIREMENT.



THE CODE GENERALLY REQUIRES DISTRIBUTIONS TO COMMENCE AFTER THE EMPLOYEE HAS ATTAINED AGE 70-1/2.

NONQUALIFIED SAVINGS PLAN



THE NONQUALIFIED SAVINGS PLAN DESCRIBED ON PAGES 139 AND 146 DOES NOT PERMIT EMPLOYEE CONTRIBUTIONS, BUT PROVIDES 7 PERCENT OF ELIGIBLE PAY TO RESTORE

MATCHING CONTRIBUTIONS THAT COULD NOT BE MADE TO THE QUALIFIED PLAN DUE TO CODE LIMITS.



THE NONQUALIFIED SAVINGS PLAN BALANCE IS PAID IN A SINGLE LUMP SUM SIX MONTHS AFTER RETIREMENT.

COMPENSATION COMMITTEE DECISIONS

THE COMMITTEE SETS THE COMPENSATION FOR THE NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AND CERTAIN OTHER SENIOR EXECUTIVES. THE FOLLOWING DESCRIBES THE BASIS ON WHICH THE

COMMITTEE MADE DECISIONS IN 2009.

ANALYTICAL TOOLS

TALLY SHEETS



A TALLY SHEET IS A MATRIX USED BY THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE THAT SHOWS THE INDIVIDUAL ELEMENTS OF COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS FOR EACH NAMED EXECUTIVE

OFFICER. THE TOTAL OF ALL COMPENSATION AND BENEFIT PLAN ELEMENTS IS INCLUDED TO REFLECT THE FULL EMPLOYMENT COSTS FOR EACH NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICER.



TALLY SHEETS WERE USED FOR THE FOLLOWING PRINCIPAL PURPOSES.



TO UNDERSTAND HOW DECISIONS ON EACH INDIVIDUAL ELEMENT OF COMPENSATION AFFECT TOTAL COMPENSATION FOR EACH SENIOR EXECUTIVE;



TO GAUGE TOTAL COMPENSATION FOR EACH SENIOR EXECUTIVE AGAINST PUBLICLY AVAILABLE DATA FOR SIMILAR POSITIONS AT COMPARATOR COMPANIES; AND,



TO CONFIRM THAT EQUITY COMPENSATION REPRESENTS A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF EACH SENIOR EXECUTIVES TOTAL COMPENSATION.

PENSION MODELING



A PENSION MODELING TOOL WAS USED TO DETERMINE HOW CURRENT COMPENSATION DECISIONS WOULD AFFECT PENSION VALUES UPON RETIREMENT.

BENCHMARKING



COMPENSATION IS BENCHMARKED ANNUALLY. THE PRIMARY BENCHMARK FOR THE NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS IS A SELECT GROUP OF LARGE COMPANIES ACROSS INDUSTRIES.



COMPARATOR COMPANIES



THE FOLLOWING CRITERIA ARE USED TO SELECT COMPARATOR COMPANIES.



U.S. COMPANIES;



INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS;



LARGE SCOPE AND COMPLEXITY;



CAPITAL INTENSIVE; AND,



PROVEN SUSTAINABILITY/PERMANENCE.

129

TABLE OF CONTENTS

INDEX TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS



THE 12 COMPANIES BENCHMARKED ARE LISTED BELOW. THE COMPARATOR GROUP INCLUDED THE SAME COMPANIES AS NOTED IN THE 2009 PROXY STATEMENT, EXCEPT THAT ALTRIA AND CITIGROUP

WERE REMOVED FROM THE OVERALL ANALYSIS. ALTRIA WAS REMOVED DUE TO THE REDUCTION IN THE SCOPE OF ITS OPERATIONS WHEN THE U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL BUSINESSES WERE SEPARATED THROUGH THE FORMATION OF PHILIP MORRIS INTERNATIONAL. CITIGROUP WAS REMOVED DUE

TO THE UNCERTAIN FUTURE REGARDING THE STABILITY OF ITS BUSINESS MODEL. THE CHANGES ALIGNED THE COMPARATOR GROUP MORE CLOSELY WITH EXXONMOBILS CURRENT BUSINESS CIRCUMSTANCES AND THE ABOVE SELECTION CRITERIA.

AT&T

BOEING

CHEVRON

CONOCOPHILLIPS

GENERAL ELECTRIC

HEWLETT-PACKARD

IBM

JOHNSON & JOHNSON

PFIZER

PROCTER

& GAMBLE

UNITED TECHNOLOGIES

VERIZON



IN THE UNITED STATES, ONLY CHEVRON AND CONOCOPHILLIPS HAVE THE SIZE, COMPLEXITY, AND GEOGRAPHIC SCOPE IN THE OIL AND GAS BUSINESS TO PROVIDE REASONABLE COMPARISONS.

OTHER SMALLER OIL COMPANIES IN THE UNITED STATES DO NOT HAVE THE INTERNATIONAL SCALE OR FUNCTIONAL INTEGRATION TO MAKE COMPARISONS MEANINGFUL FOR OUR SENIOR EXECUTIVES.



PRINCIPLES



CONSISTENT WITH THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEES PRACTICE OF USING WELL-INFORMED JUDGMENT RATHER THAN FORMULAS TO DETERMINE EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION, THE COMMITTEE DOES

NOT TARGET ANY PARTICULAR PERCENTILE AMONG COMPARATOR COMPANIES AT WHICH TO ALIGN COMPENSATION.



WHEN THE COMMITTEE CROSS-CHECKS COMPENSATION LEVELS AGAINST COMPARATOR COMPANIES, THE FOCUS IS ON A BROADER AND MORE FLEXIBLE ORIENTATION, GENERALLY A RANGE AROUND THE

MEDIAN OF COMPARATOR COMPANY COMPENSATION, WHICH PROVIDES THE ABILITY TO.



BETTER RESPOND TO CHANGING BUSINESS CONDITIONS;



MANAGE SALARIES BASED ON A CAREER ORIENTATION;



MINIMIZE THE POTENTIAL FOR AUTOMATIC RATCHETING-UP OF COMPENSATION THAT COULD OCCUR WITH AN INFLEXIBLE AND NARROW TARGET AMONG BENCHMARKED COMPANIES;

AND,



DIFFERENTIATE COMPENSATION BASED ON EXPERIENCE AND PERFORMANCE LEVELS AMONG EXECUTIVES.



THESE BENCHMARKING PRINCIPLES APPLY TO SALARIES AND THE ANNUAL INCENTIVE PROGRAM THAT INCLUDES BONUS AWARDS AND STOCK GRANTS.



FOR THE PURPOSE OF ITS ANALYSIS, THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE DOES NOT ADJUST FOR DIFFERENCES IN THE TYPES OR NATURE OF BUSINESSES. CONSIDERATION IS GIVEN, HOWEVER, TO

THE DIFFERENCES IN SIZE, SCOPE, AND COMPLEXITY AMONG EXXONMOBIL AND THE COMPARATOR COMPANIES. THIS IS ONE OF SEVERAL JUDGMENTAL FACTORS THE COMMITTEE CONSIDERS AND IS NOT BASED ON A FORMULA.



THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE USES AN INDEPENDENT CONSULTANT TO ASSIST IN THIS ANALYSIS.

PERFORMANCE MEASUREMENTS

DECISIONS MADE BY THE COMPENSATION

COMMITTEE IN 2009 WERE BASED ON THE COMPANYS OPERATING AND FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE, AS WELL AS INDIVIDUAL PERFORMANCE, EXPERIENCE AND LEVEL OF RESPONSIBILITY AS DESCRIBED BELOW.

130

TABLE OF CONTENTS

INDEX TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

BUSINESS RESULTS CONSIDERED

THE OPERATING AND FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE MEASUREMENTS LISTED BELOW AND THE COMPANYS CONTINUED MAINTENANCE OF SOUND BUSINESS CONTROLS AND A STRONG

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE ENVIRONMENT FORMED THE BASIS FOR THE SALARY AND INCENTIVE AWARD DECISIONS MADE BY THE COMMITTEE IN 2009. THE COMMITTEE CONSIDERED THE RESULTS IN THE AGGREGATE AND OVER MULTIPLE YEARS, IN RECOGNITION OF THE LONG-TERM NATURE OF

OUR BUSINESS.



EARNINGS OF $19.3 BILLION IN 2009, DOWN BY 57 PERCENT VERSUS 2008. FIVE-YEAR ANNUAL AVERAGE OF $36.1 BILLION.



TOTAL SHAREHOLDER RETURN WAS A NEGATIVE 12.6 PERCENT IN 2009 VERSUS THE S&P 500 OF 26.5 PERCENT. TEN-YEAR ANNUAL AVERAGE OF 7.7 PERCENT, VERSUS THE

S&P 500 OF NEGATIVE 1.0 PERCENT.



$26 BILLION DISTRIBUTED TO SHAREHOLDERS AS DIVIDENDS AND SHARE REPURCHASES IN 2009. $213 BILLION IN DIVIDENDS PLUS SHARE REPURCHASES SINCE THE

BEGINNING OF 2000. DIVIDEND PAYMENTS PER SHARE INCREASED FOR THE 27TH CONSECUTIVE YEAR.



STRONG RESULTS IN THE AREAS OF SAFETY, HEALTH, AND ENVIRONMENT. BEST-EVER LOST-TIME INCIDENT RATE FOR COMBINED EMPLOYEE AND CONTRACTOR WORKFORCE AND

LEADING THE INDUSTRY.



INDUSTRY-LEADING RETURN ON AVERAGE CAPITAL EMPLOYED OF 16.3 PERCENT, WITH A FIVE-YEAR AVERAGE OF 29.2 PERCENT.

PERFORMANCE ASSESSMENT PROCESS



THE ABOVE BUSINESS RESULTS FORM THE CONTEXT IN WHICH THE COMMITTEE ASSESSES THE INDIVIDUAL PERFORMANCE OF EACH SENIOR EXECUTIVE, TAKING INTO ACCOUNT

EXPERIENCE AND LEVEL OF RESPONSIBILITY.



DURING THE ANNUAL EXECUTIVE DEVELOPMENT REVIEW WITH THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS IN OCTOBER OF EACH YEAR, THE CEO REVIEWS THE PERFORMANCE OF THE MANAGEMENT

COMMITTEE AND ALL OFFICERS IN ACHIEVING RESULTS IN LINE WITH THE LONG-TERM BUSINESS STRATEGIES (SEE PAGE 121).



THE SAME LONG-TERM BUSINESS STRATEGIES AND RESULTS ARE KEY ELEMENTS IN THE ASSESSMENT OF THE CEOS PERFORMANCE BY THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE.



THE PERFORMANCE OF ALL OFFICERS IS ALSO ASSESSED BY THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS THROUGHOUT THE YEAR DURING SPECIFIC BUSINESS REVIEWS AND BOARD COMMITTEE

MEETINGS THAT PROVIDE REPORTS ON STRATEGY DEVELOPMENT; OPERATING AND FINANCIAL RESULTS; SAFETY, HEALTH, AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESULTS; BUSINESS CONTROLS; AND, OTHER AREAS PERTINENT TO THE GENERAL PERFORMANCE OF THE COMPANY.



THE COMMITTEE DOES NOT USE QUANTITATIVE TARGETS OR FORMULAS TO ASSESS EXECUTIVE PERFORMANCE OR DETERMINE COMPENSATION. THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE DOES

NOT ASSIGN WEIGHTS TO THE FACTORS CONSIDERED. FORMULA-BASED PERFORMANCE ASSESSMENTS AND COMPENSATION TYPICALLY REQUIRE EMPHASIS ON TWO OR THREE BUSINESS METRICS. FOR THE COMPANY TO BE AN INDUSTRY LEADER AND EFFECTIVELY MANAGE THE TECHNICAL

COMPLEXITY AND GLOBAL SCOPE OF EXXONMOBIL, THE MOST SENIOR EXECUTIVES MUST ADVANCE MULTIPLE STRATEGIES AND OBJECTIVES IN PARALLEL, VERSUS EMPHASIZING ONE OR TWO AT THE EXPENSE OF OTHERS THAT REQUIRE EQUAL ATTENTION.



AN EXECUTIVES PERFORMANCE MUST BE HIGH IN ALL KEY PERFORMANCE AREAS FOR THE EXECUTIVE TO RECEIVE AN OVERALL SUPERIOR EVALUATION. OUTSTANDING

PERFORMANCE IN ONE AREA WILL NOT CANCEL OUT POOR PERFORMANCE IN ANOTHER. FOR EXAMPLE.



A PROBLEM IN SAFETY, HEALTH, OR ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE IN A BUSINESS UNIT FOR WHICH THE EXECUTIVE IS RESPONSIBLE COULD RESULT IN AN EXECUTIVES INCENTIVE AWARD

BEING REDUCED EVEN THOUGH THE EXECUTIVES PERFORMANCE AGAINST FINANCIAL AND OTHER CRITERIA WAS SUPERIOR.

131

TABLE OF CONTENTS

INDEX TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS



A VIOLATION OF THE COMPANYS CODE OF BUSINESS CONDUCT COULD RESULT IN ELIMINATION OF AN EXECUTIVES INCENTIVE AWARD FOR THE YEAR, AS WELL AS TERMINATION OF

EMPLOYMENT AND/OR CANCELATION OF ALL PREVIOUSLY GRANTED AWARDS THAT HAVE NOT YET VESTED OR BEEN PAID.



THE MANAGEMENT COMMITTEE AND ALL OTHER EXECUTIVE OFFICERS ARE EXPECTED TO PERFORM AT THE HIGHEST LEVEL OR THEY ARE REPLACED. IF IT IS DETERMINED THAT

ANOTHER EXECUTIVE IS READY AND WOULD MAKE A STRONGER CONTRIBUTION THAN ONE OF THE CURRENT EXECUTIVE OFFICERS, A SUCCESSION PLAN IS IMPLEMENTED.



THE FACT THAT EXECUTIVES

DO NOT HAVE EMPLOYMENT CONTRACTS, SEVERANCE AGREEMENTS, OR CHANGE-IN-CONTROL ARRANGEMENTS

ELIMINATES ANY REAL OR

PERCEIVED SAFETY NET WITH RESPECT TO JOB SECURITY. THIS INCREASES THE RISK AND CONSEQUENCES TO THE INDIVIDUAL OF PERFORMANCE THAT DOES NOT MEET THE HIGHEST STANDARDS.

INDIVIDUAL EXPERIENCE AND RESPONSIBILITY

EXPERIENCE AND ASSIGNED RESPONSIBILITIES ARE FACTORS IN ASSESSING THE CONTRIBUTION OF INDIVIDUAL EXECUTIVES. THE CURRENT RESPONSIBILITIES, TENURE IN THE CURRENT JOB, AND RECENT PAST EXPERIENCE OF EACH

NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICER ARE DESCRIBED BELOW. REFER TO PAGE 136 FOR INFORMATION ON THE LEADERSHIP STRUCTURE OF THE COMPANY.

MR. PRYOR WAS PRESIDENT OF EXXONMOBIL REFINING & SUPPLY COMPANY SINCE 2004 BEFORE BECOMING PRESIDENT OF EXXONMOBIL CHEMICAL COMPANY IN 2008.

AS DISCUSSED ON PAGE 124, THE CAREER SERVICE FOR NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS RANGES FROM 29 TO OVER 38 YEARS.

PAY AWARDED TO NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS



WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF THE COMPENSATION PROGRAM STRUCTURE AND PERFORMANCE ASSESSMENT PROCESSES DESCRIBED ABOVE, THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE ALIGNED THE

VALUE OF 2009 INCENTIVE AWARDS AND 2010 SALARY ADJUSTMENTS WITH THE.



PERFORMANCE OF THE COMPANY;



INDIVIDUAL PERFORMANCE;



LONG-TERM STRATEGIC PLAN OF THE BUSINESS; AND,



ANNUAL COMPENSATION OF COMPARATOR COMPANIES.



THE COMMITTEES DECISIONS REFLECT JUDGMENT TAKING ALL FACTORS INTO CONSIDERATION, RATHER THAN APPLICATION OF FORMULAS OR TARGETS. THE COMMITTEE

APPROVED THE INDIVIDUAL ELEMENTS OF COMPENSATION AND THE TOTAL COMPENSATION AS SHOWN IN THE TABLES BEGINNING ON PAGE 136.

132

TABLE OF CONTENTS

INDEX TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

CEO



THE HIGHER LEVEL OF COMPENSATION FOR MR. TILLERSON, CEO, VERSUS THE OTHER NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS REFLECTS HIS GREATER LEVEL OF RESPONSIBILITY,

INCLUDING THE ULTIMATE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE PERFORMANCE OF THE CORPORATION AND OVERSIGHT OF THE OTHER SENIOR EXECUTIVES.

OTHER NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS



THE HIGHER LEVEL OF COMPENSATION FOR MR. HUMPHREYS, VERSUS THE OTHER NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS, REFLECTS HIS LEVEL OF RESPONSIBILITY AS SENIOR VICE

PRESIDENT AND TREASURER AND TENURE AS A MEMBER OF THE MANAGEMENT COMMITTEE. MR. HUMPHREYS REPORTS TO THE CEO.



THE COMPENSATION FOR THE OTHER NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS IS LOWER THAN THAT OF THE CEO AND MR. HUMPHREYS BASED ON COMBINED SALARY, BONUS, AND THE

ANNUAL STOCK GRANT (CALCULATED USING THE FAIR MARKET VALUE ON DATE OF GRANT). THIS OCCURS BECAUSE MR. DOLAN HAS SHORT TENURE AS SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT AND MESSRS. CRAMER AND PRYOR REPORT TO DESIGNATED MEMBERS OF THE MANAGEMENT COMMITTEE (CEO AND

SENIOR VICE PRESIDENTS).

COMPENSATION ALLOCATION



TO ACHIEVE ALIGNMENT WITH THE INTERESTS OF SHAREHOLDERS, IT IS THE OBJECTIVE THAT 50 TO 70 PERCENT OF ANNUAL TOTAL REMUNERATION BE IN THE FORM OF STOCK

WITH LONG HOLDING PERIODS AS DESCRIBED ON PAGE 125.



TO FURTHER TIE COMPENSATION TO THE PERFORMANCE OF THE BUSINESS, THE OBJECTIVE IS TO HAVE 10 TO 20 PERCENT OF ANNUAL TOTAL REMUNERATION IN THE FORM OF

VARIABLE ANNUAL BONUS AWARDS, WHICH ARE DESCRIBED BEGINNING ON PAGE 124.



SALARY REPRESENTS LESS THAN 10 PERCENT OF ANNUAL TOTAL REMUNERATION, WITH PENSION ACCRUALS AND OTHER FORMS OF COMPENSATION COMPRISING THE REMAINDER.



WHETHER AN EXECUTIVES TOTAL COMPENSATION IS NEAR, SUBSTANTIALLY BELOW, OR SUBSTANTIALLY ABOVE THE COMPARATOR GROUP MEDIAN IS A QUALITATIVE FACTOR

THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE CONSIDERS ALONG WITH EXPERIENCE, LEVEL OF RESPONSIBILITY, AND PERFORMANCE (SEE PAGE 130).



THE ALLOCATION OF COMPENSATION IN 2009 FOR THE CEO AND THE AVERAGE FOR THE OTHER NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS IS ILLUSTRATED IN THE CHART BELOW.

SALARY



THE CHANGES IN SALARY FOR THE NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS FROM THE PRIOR YEAR, AS SHOWN IN THE SUMMARY COMPENSATION TABLE PRIMARILY REFLECT

ADJUSTMENT TO THE COMPETITIVE POSITION OF THE BASE SALARY PROGRAM FOR ALL U.S. EXECUTIVES, TAKING INTO ACCOUNT INCREASED INDIVIDUAL EXPERIENCE AND LEVEL OF RESPONSIBILITY.

133

TABLE OF CONTENTS

INDEX TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

BONUS



ANNUAL BONUSES (CONSISTING OF CASH PLUS THE FULL VALUE OF EBU AWARDS) FOR THE NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS OTHER THAN MR. DOLAN WERE REDUCED 40

PERCENT COMPARED TO 2008. MR. DOLANS BONUS WAS REDUCED 32 PERCENT.



THE CHANGES PRIMARILY REFLECT A LOWER LEVEL OF COMPANY EARNINGS IN 2009.



THE RELATIVE DIFFERENCE IN MR. DOLANS BONUS COMPARED TO THE OTHER NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS REFLECTS HIS TRANSITION TO A HIGHER-LEVEL

POSITION. MR. DOLAN FIRST JOINED THE COMPANYS MANAGEMENT COMMITTEE IN 2008.

RESTRICTED STOCK



THE NUMBER OF SHARES GRANTED AS RESTRICTED STOCK IN 2009 TO EACH NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICER WAS THE SAME AS THEIR 2008 GRANT EXCEPT FOR MR. DOLAN,

WHOSE GRANT LEVEL WAS INCREASED.



THE GRANT DATE FAIR VALUE OF EACH RESTRICTED SHARE WAS 4 PERCENT LOWER IN 2009, IN LINE WITH THE LOWER STOCK PRICE ON THE 2009 GRANT DATE COMPARED TO

2008.



THE INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF SHARES GRANTED TO MR. DOLAN FROM 2008 REFLECTS HIS TRANSITION TO A HIGHER-LEVEL POSITION AS PREVIOUSLY NOTED.

OTHER COMPENSATION



THIS CATEGORY COMPRISES THE CHANGE IN PENSION VALUE AND ALL OTHER COMPENSATION AS SHOWN IN THE SUMMARY COMPENSATION TABLE.

AWARD TIMING



THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE GRANTS INCENTIVE AWARDS TO THE COMPANYS SENIOR EXECUTIVES AT THEIR REGULAR NOVEMBER MEETING, WHICH IS HELD EITHER THE

DAY OF OR THE DAY BEFORE THE REGULARLY SCHEDULED NOVEMBER BOARD OF DIRECTORS MEETING.



THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS MEETING IS SCHEDULED OVER A YEAR IN ADVANCE AND IS HELD ON THE LAST WEDNESDAY OF THE MONTH (OR ON TUESDAY IF THE LAST WEDNESDAY IMMEDIATELY

PRECEDES THANKSGIVING).



THIS FIRM TIMING OF AWARD GRANTS IS REINFORCED THROUGH A DECISION-MAKING PROCESS IN WHICH THE CORPORATION DOES NOT GRANT AWARDS BY WRITTEN CONSENT.



A COMMITTEE COMPRISING EXXONMOBILS CHAIRMAN AND SENIOR VICE PRESIDENTS GRANTS INCENTIVE AWARDS TO OTHER ELIGIBLE MANAGERIAL, PROFESSIONAL, AND

TECHNICAL EMPLOYEES, WITHIN THE PARAMETERS OF THE BONUS AND EQUITY AWARD CEILINGS APPROVED BY THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE. THE SCHEDULE OF THE NOVEMBER MEETING OF THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE AS DESCRIBED ABOVE DETERMINES WHEN THIS COMMITTEE MEETS TO

APPROVE THE ANNUAL INCENTIVE GRANTS FOR EMPLOYEES UNDER ITS PURVIEW.



THE COMPANY HAS NOT GRANTED STOCK OPTIONS SINCE 2001.



PREVIOUSLY GRANTED STOCK OPTIONS THAT REMAIN OUTSTANDING WERE GRANTED ON THE SAME ANNUAL SCHEDULE DESCRIBED ABOVE EXCEPT FOR GRANTS IN 1999. DUE TO THE

FACT THAT THE MERGER OF EXXON CORPORATION AND MOBIL CORPORATION CLOSED ON NOVEMBER 30 OF THAT YEAR, THE REGULAR ANNUAL GRANT MEETING DATE WAS MOVED TO DECEMBER 8. GRANTS TO OTHER MANAGERIAL, PROFESSIONAL, AND TECHNICAL EMPLOYEES WERE MADE

ON DECEMBER 8, AND ALSO TO ADDITIONAL GRANTEES ON APRIL 26, 2000, AFTER EMPLOYEE DATA FOR THE TWO COMPANIES HAD BEEN MORE FULLY INTEGRATED.



THE EXERCISE PRICE FOR EACH STOCK OPTION GRANT WAS THE AVERAGE OF THE HIGH AND LOW SALE PRICES REPORTED ON THE NYSE ON THE DATE OF THE GRANT MEETING.

134

TABLE OF CONTENTS

INDEX TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

TAX MATTERS



U.S. INCOME TAX LAW LIMITS THE AMOUNT EXXONMOBIL CAN DEDUCT FOR COMPENSATION PAID TO THE CEO AND THE OTHER THREE MOST HIGHLY PAID EXECUTIVES OTHER THAN

THE PRINCIPAL FINANCIAL OFFICER (PFO). PERFORMANCE-BASED COMPENSATION THAT MEETS INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE REQUIREMENTS IS NOT SUBJECT TO THIS LIMIT.



THE SHORT TERM AWARDS AND RESTRICTED STOCK GRANTS DESCRIBED ABOVE ARE INTENDED TO MEET THESE REQUIREMENTS SO THAT EXXONMOBIL CAN DEDUCT THE RELATED EXPENSES. UNDER THE

MATERIAL TERMS OF PERFORMANCE GOALS PREVIOUSLY APPROVED BY SHAREHOLDERS, THE CORPORATION MUST ACHIEVE POSITIVE NET INCOME (EARNINGS) IN ORDER TO MAKE ANY INCENTIVE AWARDS TO THE COVERED EXECUTIVES. IF POSITIVE EARNINGS ARE ACHIEVED, INDIVIDUAL

AWARDS TO THESE EXECUTIVES ARE SUBJECT TO A MAXIMUM CAP OF 0.2 PERCENT OF EARNINGS IN THE CASE OF SHORT TERM AWARDS, AND 0.5 PERCENT OF EARNINGS IN THE CASE OF LONG TERM AWARDS. RESTRICTED STOCK AWARDS TO THE COVERED EXECUTIVES FOR PURPOSES OF

SECTION 162(M) OF THE INTERNAL REVENUE CODE ARE ONLY MADE UNDER THE PERFORMANCE STOCK PROVISIONS OF THE 2003 INCENTIVE PROGRAM, WHICH INCLUDE THE SHAREHOLDER-APPROVED GOAL AND CAP. THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE HAS NO AUTHORITY TO

AMEND OR CHANGE THE SHAREHOLDER-APPROVED GOALS.



THESE TERMS HAVE BEEN ESTABLISHED TO MEET TAX REGULATIONS AND DO NOT REPRESENT THE ACTUAL OPERATIONAL GOALS WE EXPECT OUR SENIOR EXECUTIVES TO ACHIEVE.

ACTUAL AWARD LEVELS ARE DETERMINED BASED ON A SUBJECTIVE CONSIDERATION OF ALL THE FACTORS PREVIOUSLY DISCUSSED IN THIS REPORT AND HAVE BEEN SIGNIFICANTLY LESS THAN THE SHAREHOLDER-APPROVED CAPS.



SALARIES FOR SENIOR EXECUTIVES MAY BE SET AT LEVELS THAT EXCEED THE U.S. INCOME TAX LAW LIMITATION ON DEDUCTIBILITY. THE PRIMARY DRIVERS FOR DETERMINING THE AMOUNT AND

FORM OF EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION ARE THE RETENTION AND MOTIVATION OF SUPERIOR EXECUTIVE TALENT RATHER THAN THE INTERNAL REVENUE CODE.



IN 2005, THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE ELIMINATED THE ABILITY OF EXECUTIVES TO DEFER PAYMENT OF INCENTIVE AWARDS. NO ELEMENT OF COMPENSATION FOR

EXECUTIVES CAN BE DEFERRED PRIOR TO RETIREMENT.



TAX ASSISTANCE IS NOT PROVIDED BY THE COMPANY FOR EITHER THE SHORT TERM OR LONG TERM INCENTIVE AWARDS DISCUSSED ABOVE.



THE COMPANY HAS DESIGNED ALL NONQUALIFIED PENSION AND OTHER BENEFITS IN A MANNER INTENDED TO AVOID TAX PENALTIES THAT POTENTIALLY COULD BE IMPOSED ON

THE RECIPIENTS OF SUCH AMOUNTS BY SECTION 409A OF THE CODE BY FIXING THE FORM AND TIMING OF DISTRIBUTIONS TO ELIMINATE EXECUTIVE AND COMPANY DISCRETION.



THE ABOVE DISCUSSION OF TAX CONSEQUENCES IS BASED ON THE COMPANYS INTERPRETATION OF CURRENT TAX LAWS.



AS DISCUSSED IN ITEM 3, A PURPORTED SHAREHOLDER COMPLAINT HAS BEEN FILED ALLEGING, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THAT CERTAIN INCENTIVE COMPENSATION AWARDED TO

THE NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS IS NOT TAX DEDUCTIBLE BY THE COMPANY.

LEADERSHIP STRUCTURE



THE DISCLOSURE REGULATIONS RESULT IN A ROSTER OF NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS DIFFERENT FROM THE MOST SENIOR MANAGEMENT TEAM LEADING THE COMPANY, WHICH IS

REFERRED TO AS THE MANAGEMENT COMMITTEE. THE MANAGEMENT COMMITTEE COMPRISES THE FOLLOWING.



CHAIRMAN AND CEO: R.W. TILLERSON



SENIOR VICE PRESIDENTS WHO REPORT DIRECTLY TO THE CEO.



D.D. HUMPHREYS;



M.W. ALBERS;



M.J. DOLAN; AND,



A.P. SWIGER.



ALL MEMBERS OF THE MANAGEMENT COMMITTEE ARE SHOWN AS NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS EXCEPT FOR MESSRS. ALBERS AND SWIGER. CONSISTENT WITH OUR CAREER

ORIENTATION, WHICH IS SUPPORTED BY A CAREER-BASED COMPENSATION STRATEGY, THEIR INDIVIDUAL COMPENSATION LEVELS DO NOT CURRENTLY PLACE THEM AMONG THE NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS.



ALTHOUGH EACH MEMBER OF THE MANAGEMENT COMMITTEE IS RESPONSIBLE FOR SPECIFIC BUSINESS ACTIVITIES, TOGETHER THEY SHARE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE

PERFORMANCE OF THE COMPANY.

EMPLOYMENT ARRANGEMENTS

EXXONMOBILS COMPENSATION COMMITTEE BELIEVES SENIOR EXECUTIVES SHOULD BE AT WILL EMPLOYEES OF THE CORPORATION. ACCORDINGLY, THE CEO AND OTHER EXECUTIVE OFFICERS, INCLUDING THE OTHER

OFFICERS NAMED IN THESE TABLES,

DO NOT HAVE EMPLOYMENT CONTRACTS, SEVERANCE AGREEMENTS, OR CHANGE-IN-CONTROL ARRANGEMENTS

WITH THE COMPANY.

136

TABLE OF CONTENTS

INDEX TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

SALARY



EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2010, THE ANNUAL SALARY OF THE NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS INCREASED AS FOLLOWS: MR. TILLERSONS TO $2,207,000,

MR. HUMPHREYS TO $1,085,000, AND MR. PRYORS TO $955,000. EFFECTIVE APRIL 1, 2010, THE ANNUAL SALARY OF MR. DOLAN WILL INCREASE TO $935,000.



THE 2009 AND 2010 SALARY INCREASES REFLECT ADJUSTMENTS TO THE COMPETITIVE POSITION OF THE BASE SALARY PROGRAM FOR U.S. EXECUTIVES, TAKING INTO ACCOUNT

INDIVIDUAL EXPERIENCE AND LEVEL OF RESPONSIBILITY.



SALARY (TOGETHER WITH OTHER COMPENSATION RELATED TO FRINGE BENEFITS OR PERQUISITES) IS NOT DEDUCTIBLE BY THE CORPORATION TO THE EXTENT THAT IT EXCEEDS

$1 MILLION FOR ANY NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICER.

BONUS



AS DESCRIBED IN MORE DETAIL IN THE COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (CD&A), THE 2009 BONUS SHOWN WAS PAID HALF IN CASH AT THE TIME

OF GRANT. THE COMPANY DELAYS PAYMENT OF THE BALANCE UNTIL CUMULATIVE EARNINGS REACH $5.75 PER SHARE.



DELAYED BONUS AMOUNTS DO NOT EARN INTEREST.



THE BONUS AND THE STOCK AWARDS DESCRIBED BELOW ARE INTENDED TO MEET THE REQUIREMENTS OF SECTION 162(M) OF THE INTERNAL REVENUE CODE. SEE TAX

MATTERS ON PAGE 135.

STOCK AWARDS



IN ACCORDANCE WITH DISCLOSURE REGULATIONS, THE VALUATION OF STOCK AWARDS IN THIS TABLE REPRESENTS THE GRANT DATE FAIR VALUE WHICH IS EQUAL

TO THE NUMBER OF SHARES AWARDED TIMES THE GRANT PRICE, WHICH IS DEEMED TO BE THE AVERAGE OF THE HIGH AND LOW SALE PRICES ON THE NYSE ON THE GRANT DATE ($75.40 ON NOVEMBER 24, 2009; $78.24 ON NOVEMBER 25, 2008; AND $87.14 ON

NOVEMBER 28, 2007).



SEE THE NARRATIVE ACCOMPANYING THE GRANTS OF PLAN-BASED AWARDS TABLE FOR INFORMATION REGARDING THE TERMS OF RESTRICTED STOCK.



DIVIDENDS ON STOCK AWARDS ARE NOT SHOWN IN THE TABLE BECAUSE THOSE AMOUNTS ARE REFLECTED IN THE GRANT DATE FAIR VALUE.

CHANGE IN PENSION VALUE AND NONQUALIFIED DEFERRED COMPENSATION EARNINGS

THE AMOUNTS SHOWN IN THIS COLUMN IN THE SUMMARY COMPENSATION TABLE FOR YEARS 2009 AND 2008 REPRESENT THE CHANGE IN PENSION VALUE. FOR YEAR 2007, THE AMOUNT ALSO INCLUDES NONQUALIFIED DEFERRED

EARNINGS FOR MESSRS. TILLERSON, HUMPHREYS, AND CRAMER.

PENSION VALUE



THE CHANGE IN PENSION VALUE SHOWN IN THE TABLE FOR 2009 IS THE INCREASE BETWEEN YEAR-END 2008 AND YEAR-END 2009 IN THE PRESENT VALUE OF EACH

EXECUTIVES PENSION BENEFITS UNDER THE PLANS DESCRIBED IN MORE DETAIL IN THE TEXT FOLLOWING THE PENSION BENEFITS TABLE ON PAGE 143.



FOR EACH YEAR END, THE DATA REFLECT AN ANNUITY BEGINNING AT AGE 60 (OR CURRENT AGE IF OVER 60) EQUAL TO 1.6 PERCENT OF THE PARTICIPANTS COVERED

COMPENSATION MULTIPLIED BY YEAR-END SERVICE. THESE VALUES ARE CONVERTED TO LUMP SUMS USING THE PLANS APPLICABLE FACTORS AND THEN DISCOUNTED IN THE CASE OF EMPLOYEES UNDER AGE 60 TO PRESENT VALUES BASED ON THE TIME DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE

INDIVIDUALS AGE AT YEAR-END 2008 AND AGE 60 (AND AT YEAR-END 2009 AND AGE 60) USING THE INTEREST RATES FOR FINANCIAL REPORTING OF PENSION OBLIGATIONS AS OF EACH YEAR END. THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO YEAR-END AMOUNTS REPRESENTS THE ANNUAL

INCREASE IN THE VALUE OF THE PENSION SHOWN IN THE SUMMARY COMPENSATION TABLE.



THE LUMP SUM INTEREST RATE APPLIED FOR AN EMPLOYEE WHO WORKED THROUGH THE END OF 2008 WAS 4.25 PERCENT. THE LUMP SUM INTEREST RATE APPLIED FOR AN

EMPLOYEE WHO WORKED THROUGH THE END OF 2009 WAS 4 PERCENT.

137

TABLE OF CONTENTS

INDEX TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS



THE DISCOUNT RATE FOR DETERMINING THE PRESENT VALUE OF BENEFITS WAS 6.25 PERCENT AS OF YEAR-END 2008 AND 6 PERCENT AS OF YEAR-END 2009. THE REDUCTION

IN THE LUMP SUM INTEREST RATE AND THE DISCOUNT RATE RESULTS IN AN INCREASE IN THE PRESENT VALUE OF AGE 60 BENEFITS SHOWN FOR THE NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS.

NONQUALIFIED DEFERRED EARNINGS



THE PORTION OF ANNUAL EARNINGS ON EACH EXECUTIVES PRINCIPAL BALANCE UNDER THE CORPORATIONS NONQUALIFIED SUPPLEMENTAL SAVINGS PLAN THAT

EXCEEDS 120 PERCENT OF THE LONG-TERM APPLICABLE FEDERAL RATE, COMPOUNDED MONTHLY, AS PRESCRIBED UNDER SECTION 1274(D) OF THE INTERNAL REVENUE CODE, IS REQUIRED TO BE DISCLOSED. AS OF JANUARY 1, 2008, THE BASIS FOR THE INTEREST RATE DURING

THE TERM OF A PARTICIPANTS EMPLOYMENT WAS CHANGED FROM THE CITIBANK PRIME LENDING RATE TO 120 PERCENT OF THE LONG-TERM APPLICABLE FEDERAL RATE. AS A RESULT, REPORTABLE EARNINGS ON NONQUALIFIED DEFERRED COMPENSATION HAVE NOT BEEN INCURRED SINCE

2007.

ALL OTHER COMPENSATION

THE FOLLOWING TABLE BREAKS DOWN THE AMOUNTS INCLUDED IN THE ALL OTHER COMPENSATION COLUMN OF THE SUMMARY COMPENSATION TABLE. NOTE THE TABLE HAS BEEN CHANGED FROM LAST YEAR AS

FOLLOWS: REMOVED THE COLUMNS RELOCATION AND TAX ASSISTANCE SINCE THE NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS DID NOT HAVE ANY RELOCATION COSTS OR RECEIVE ANY TAX ASSISTANCE IN 2009.

LIFE INSURANCE



THE COMPANY OFFERS SENIOR EXECUTIVES TERM LIFE INSURANCE OR A COMPANY-PAID DEATH BENEFIT.



COVERAGE UNDER EITHER OPTION EQUALS FOUR TIMES BASE SALARY UNTIL AGE 65, AND A DECLINING MULTIPLE THEREAFTER UNTIL AGE 75, AT WHICH POINT THE MULTIPLE

REMAINS AT 2.5 TIMES SALARY.



FOR EXECUTIVES WITH LIFE INSURANCE COVERAGE, THE PREMIUM COST IN ANY YEAR DEPENDS ON OVERALL FINANCIAL AND MORTALITY EXPERIENCE UNDER THE GROUP POLICY.



FOR EXECUTIVES ELECTING THE DEATH BENEFIT, THERE IS NO CASH COST UNTIL THE EXECUTIVE DIES, AS BENEFITS ARE PAID DIRECTLY BY THE COMPANY.



THE AMOUNT SHOWN IS BASED ON INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE TABLES USED TO VALUE THE TERM COST OF SUCH COVERAGE. THIS VALUATION IS APPLIED SINCE THE ACTUAL

LIFE INSURANCE PREMIUM IS A SINGLE PAYMENT FOR A LARGE GROUP OF EXECUTIVES THAT DOES NOT REPRESENT THE COST OF INSURING ONE SPECIFIC INDIVIDUAL AND BECAUSE SEVERAL OF THE NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS HAVE ELECTED THE DEATH BENEFIT, THE LONG-TERM COST OF

WHICH IS COMPARABLE TO THE INSURANCE.



THE COMPANY ELIMINATED THE EXECUTIVE TERM LIFE INSURANCE AND COMPANY-PAID DEATH BENEFIT FOR ALL NEWLY ELIGIBLE EXECUTIVES AS OF OCTOBER 1, 2007,

AND RETAINED IT FOR ALL CURRENT PARTICIPANTS, INCLUDING THE NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS.

138

TABLE OF CONTENTS

INDEX TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

SAVINGS PLAN



THE AMOUNT SHOWN IS THE VALUE OF COMPANY-MATCHING CONTRIBUTIONS UNDER EXXONMOBILS TAX-QUALIFIED DEFINED CONTRIBUTION (401(K)) PLAN AND

COMPANY CREDITS UNDER THE RELATED NONQUALIFIED SUPPLEMENTAL PLAN. THE COMPANY CREDIT WAS PREVIOUSLY 6 PERCENT AND WAS INCREASED TO 7 PERCENT EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2008.



THE NONQUALIFIED SUPPLEMENTAL PLAN PROVIDES ALL AFFECTED EMPLOYEES WITH THE 7-PERCENT COMPANY CREDIT TO WHICH THEY WOULD OTHERWISE BE ENTITLED AS A

MATCHING CONTRIBUTION UNDER THE QUALIFIED PLAN BUT FOR LIMITATIONS UNDER THE INTERNAL REVENUE CODE. ALL AFFECTED EMPLOYEES PARTICIPATE IN THE NONQUALIFIED SUPPLEMENTAL PLAN ON THE SAME BASIS.



THE VALUE OF THE CREDITS TO THE NONQUALIFIED SUPPLEMENTAL PLAN IS ALSO DISCLOSED IN THE NONQUALIFIED DEFERRED COMPENSATION TABLE ON PAGE

145.

PERSONAL SECURITY



THE COMPANY PROVIDES SECURITY FOR ITS EMPLOYEES AS APPROPRIATE BASED ON AN ASSESSMENT OF RISK. THE ASSESSMENT INCLUDES CONSIDERATION OF THE

EMPLOYEES POSITION AND WORK LOCATION.



THE COMPANY DOES NOT CONSIDER ANY SUCH SECURITY COSTS TO BE PERSONAL BENEFITS SINCE THESE COSTS ARISE FROM THE NATURE OF THE EMPLOYEES EMPLOYMENT

BY THE COMPANY; HOWEVER, THE DISCLOSURE REGULATIONS REQUIRE CERTAIN SECURITY COSTS TO BE REPORTED AS PERSONAL BENEFITS.



THE AMOUNTS SHOWN IN THE TABLE INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING TYPES OF SECURITY-RELATED COSTS: SECURITY SYSTEMS AT EXECUTIVE RESIDENCES; SECURITY SERVICES AND

PERSONNEL (AT RESIDENCES AND/OR DURING PERSONAL TRAVEL); CAR AND PERSONAL SECURITY DRIVER; AND COMPANY MOBILE PHONES. COSTS OF SECURITY RELATING TO TRAVEL FOR BUSINESS PURPOSES ARE NOT INCLUDED.



CARS PROVIDED FOR SECURITY REASONS AND USED PRIMARILY FOR COMMUTING ARE VALUED BASED ON THE ANNUALIZED COST OF THE CAR PLUS MAINTENANCE AND FUEL.

REPORTED COSTS FOR RENTAL CARS UTILIZED DUE TO SECURITY CONCERNS DURING PERSONAL TRAVEL ARE THE ACTUAL INCREMENTAL COSTS.



FOR SECURITY PERSONNEL EMPLOYED BY THE COMPANY, THE COST IS THE ACTUAL INCREMENTAL COST OF EXPENSES INCURRED BY THE SECURITY PERSONNEL. TOTAL SALARY,

WAGES, AND BENEFITS FOR SECURITY PERSONNEL ARE NOT ALLOCATED BECAUSE THE COMPANY ALREADY INCURS THESE COSTS FOR BUSINESS PURPOSES.



FOR SECURITY CONTRACTORS, THE COST IS THE ACTUAL INCREMENTAL COST OF SUCH CONTRACTORS ASSOCIATED WITH THE EXECUTIVES PERSONAL TIME.



FOR MR. TILLERSON, THE AMOUNT SHOWN INCLUDES $27,440 FOR CAR AND $30,822 FOR RESIDENTIAL SECURITY. THE REMAINDER IS FOR MOBILE PHONES AND OTHER

COMMUNICATIONS EQUIPMENT FOR CONDUCTING BUSINESS IN A SECURE MANNER, AND COST OF SECURITY RELATING TO PERSONAL TRAVEL.

AIRCRAFT



INCREMENTAL COST FOR PERSONAL USE OF THE AIRCRAFT IS BASED ON DIRECT OPERATING COSTS (FUEL, AIRPORT FEES, INCREMENTAL PILOT COSTS, ETC.) AND DOES NOT

INCLUDE CAPITAL COSTS OF THE AIRCRAFT SINCE THE COMPANY ALREADY INCURS THESE CAPITAL COSTS FOR BUSINESS PURPOSES.



FOR SECURITY REASONS, THE BOARD REQUIRES THE CHAIRMAN AND CEO TO USE COMPANY AIRCRAFT FOR BOTH BUSINESS AND PERSONAL TRAVEL.



THE COMMITTEE CONSIDERS THESE COSTS TO BE NECESSARY, SECURITY-RELATED BUSINESS EXPENSES RATHER THAN PERQUISITES, BUT PER THE DISCLOSURE REGULATIONS, WE

REPORT THE INCREMENTAL COST OF AIRCRAFT USAGE FOR PERSONAL TRAVEL.

139

TABLE OF CONTENTS

INDEX TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

PROPERTIES



THE COMPANY OWNS OR LEASES VARIOUS VENUES FOR THE PURPOSE OF BUSINESS ENTERTAINMENT, INCLUDING BOXES AND SEASON TICKETS TO SPORTING EVENTS AND

RECREATION AND CONFERENCE RETREAT PROPERTIES. WHEN THESE VENUES ARE NOT OTHERWISE IN USE FOR BUSINESS ENTERTAINMENT, THE TICKETS AND PROPERTIES MAY BE AVAILABLE FOR USE BY COMPANY EXECUTIVES AND OTHER PERSONNEL.



THE TABLE SHOWS THE INCREMENTAL COST INCURRED FOR ANY PERSONAL USE OF THESE VENUES BY THE NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS.



COST FOR THIS PURPOSE IS BASED SOLELY ON INCREMENTAL OPERATING COSTS (CATERING, TRANSPORTATION, INCREMENTAL EMPLOYEE OR CONTRACTOR COSTS, ETC.) AND

DOES NOT INCLUDE ANNUAL OR CAPITAL COSTS OF THESE VENUES SINCE THE COMPANY ALREADY INCURS THESE COSTS FOR BUSINESS PURPOSES.

CAR



INCREMENTAL COST FOR PERSONAL USE OF COMPANY CAR BY EXECUTIVES OTHER THAN MR. TILLERSON (WHOSE CAR-RELATED EXPENSES ARE INCLUDED UNDER

PERSONAL SECURITY) IS BASED ON AN ASSUMED COST IN 2009 OF $0.55 PER MILE. DRIVER PERSONNEL COSTS ARE NOT ALLOCATED BECAUSE THE COMPANY ALREADY INCURS THESE COSTS FOR BUSINESS PURPOSES.

FINANCIAL PLANNING



THE COMPANY PROVIDES FINANCIAL PLANNING SERVICES TO SENIOR EXECUTIVES, WHICH INCLUDES TAX PREPARATION. THIS BENEFIT IS VALUED BASED ON THE ACTUAL

CHARGE FOR THE SERVICES.

THE AWARDS GRANTED IN 2009 ARE IN THE FORM OF RESTRICTED STOCK.

RESTRICTIONS AND FORFEITURE RISK



THESE GRANTS ARE RESTRICTED (1) FOR HALF THE SHARES, UNTIL FIVE YEARS AFTER THE GRANT DATE; AND, (2) FOR THE BALANCE, UNTIL 10 YEARS AFTER

THE GRANT DATE OR RETIREMENT, WHICHEVER OCCURS LATER. THESE RESTRICTED PERIODS ARE NOT SUBJECT TO ACCELERATION, EXCEPT UPON DEATH, AND THUS, SHARES MAY REMAIN SUBJECT TO RESTRICTION FOR MANY YEARS AFTER AN EXECUTIVES RETIREMENT.

PENSION PLAN



THE TAX-QUALIFIED PENSION PLAN PROVIDES A BENEFIT CALCULATED AS AN ANNUAL ANNUITY BEGINNING AT AGE 65 (THE PLANS NORMAL RETIREMENT AGE) EQUAL TO

1.6 PERCENT OF THE PARTICIPANTS FINAL AVERAGE SALARY MULTIPLIED BY YEARS OF CREDITED SERVICE, MINUS AN OFFSET FOR SOCIAL SECURITY BENEFITS.



FINAL AVERAGE SALARY IS THE AVERAGE OF THE HIGHEST 36 CONSECUTIVE MONTHS IN THE 10 YEARS OF SERVICE PRIOR TO RETIREMENT.



FINAL AVERAGE SALARY INCLUDED AND BENEFITS PAID ARE SUBJECT TO THE LIMITS ON COMPENSATION ($245,000 FOR 2009) AND BENEFITS PRESCRIBED UNDER THE INTERNAL REVENUE CODE.



THE BENEFIT IS AVAILABLE AS A LUMP SUM OR IN VARIOUS ANNUITY FORMS.



THE DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION ARRANGEMENTS (QUALIFIED AND NONQUALIFIED) HELP TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN EMPLOYEES AT ALL LEVELS OF THE CORPORATION.



THE DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLAN PROVIDES A STRONG INCENTIVE FOR EMPLOYEES TO STAY UNTIL RETIREMENT AGE.



THE PLAN USES FINAL AVERAGE PAY APPLIED TO ALL YEARS OF SERVICE, AND THUS, THE INCREASE IN PENSION VALUES IS GREATEST LATE IN CAREER, WHEN COMPENSATION

TENDS TO BE HIGHEST. THIS RETENTION FEATURE IS STRONG FOR HIGH PERFORMERS, WHOSE COMPENSATION INCREASES AS THEIR JOB RESPONSIBILITIES CONTINUE TO EXPAND THROUGHOUT THEIR CAREER, MAKING THEIR LEVEL OF RETIREMENT INCOME PERFORMANCE-BASED.

SUPPLEMENTAL PENSION PLAN



THE NONQUALIFIED SUPPLEMENTAL PENSION PLAN PROVIDES A BENEFIT CALCULATED AS AN ANNUITY ON SALARY ABOVE THE INTERNAL REVENUE CODE LIMIT.



IT IS CALCULATED AS AN ANNUAL ANNUITY BEGINNING AT AGE 65 EQUAL TO 1.6 PERCENT OF THE PARTICIPANTS FINAL AVERAGE SALARY OVER THE INTERNAL REVENUE

CODE LIMIT MULTIPLIED BY YEARS OF CREDITED SERVICE.



TO HELP MEET THE RETENTION AND PERFORMANCE OBJECTIVES DESCRIBED FOR U.S. SALARIED EMPLOYEES, THE SUPPLEMENTAL PENSION PLAN PROVIDES PENSION BENEFITS TO

THE EXTENT ANNUAL PAY EXCEEDS THE AMOUNT

143

TABLE OF CONTENTS

INDEX TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

THAT CAN BE CONSIDERED IN DETERMINING QUALIFIED PENSION BENEFITS ($245,000 FOR 2009, ADJUSTED EACH YEAR BASED ON INFLATION).



WITHOUT THE SUPPLEMENTAL PENSION PLAN, THE RETENTION POWER OF THE OVERALL PENSION PLAN WOULD BE GREATLY REDUCED FOR EMPLOYEES EARNING MORE THAN THAT

AMOUNT, SINCE THE INCREASE IN THEIR PENSION VALUES IN MID- TO LATE-CAREER WOULD BE BASED ON RELATIVELY FLAT FINAL AVERAGE PAY.

ADDITIONAL PAYMENTS PLAN



THE NONQUALIFIED ADDITIONAL PAYMENTS PLAN PROVIDES A BENEFIT CALCULATED AS AN ANNUAL ANNUITY BEGINNING AT AGE 65 EQUAL TO 1.6 PERCENT OF THE

PARTICIPANTS AVERAGE ANNUAL BONUS MULTIPLIED BY YEARS OF CREDITED SERVICE.



THE PLAN USES THE AVERAGE OF THE ANNUAL BONUS FOR THE THREE HIGHEST GRANTS OF THE LAST FIVE PRIOR TO RETIREMENT (INCLUDING THE PORTION OF THE ANNUAL BONUS THAT IS PAID

AT TIME OF GRANT AND THE PORTION THAT IS PAID ON A DELAYED BASIS AS DESCRIBED ON PAGE 128).



BENEFITS UNDER THE ADDITIONAL PAYMENTS PLAN ARE FORFEITED IF AN EMPLOYEE RESIGNS PRIOR TO COMPLETION OF 15 YEARS OF SERVICE AND ATTAINMENT OF AGE 55.

ALL OF THE NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS HAVE SATISFIED THESE CONDITIONS.



THE OBJECTIVE OF THE ADDITIONAL PAYMENTS PLAN IS TO SUPPORT RETENTION AND PERFORMANCE OBJECTIVES IN LIGHT OF THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEES PRACTICE

OF PUTTING HIGHER PERCENTAGES OF ANNUAL CASH COMPENSATION AT RISK AT HIGHER EXECUTIVE LEVELS.



THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE BELIEVES THAT EVEN THOUGH A LARGE PERCENTAGE OF ANNUAL CASH COMPENSATION IS DISCRETIONARY AND BASED ON CORPORATE BUSINESS

PERFORMANCE, IT SHOULD NOT BE EXCLUDED FROM THE PENSION CALCULATION. INCLUSION OF DISCRETIONARY BONUSES IN THE PENSION FORMULA STRENGTHENS THE PERFORMANCE BASIS OF SUCH BONUSES.



BY LIMITING BONUSES TO THOSE GRANTED IN THE FIVE YEARS PRIOR TO RETIREMENT, THERE IS A STRONG MOTIVATION FOR EXECUTIVES TO CONTINUE TO PERFORM AT A

HIGH LEVEL.



THE ADDITIONAL PAYMENTS PLAN IS DESIGNED TO BE A POWERFUL RETENTION TOOL, SINCE BENEFITS ARE FORFEITED IF THE EMPLOYEE RESIGNS PRIOR TO COMPLETION OF

15 YEARS OF SERVICE AND ATTAINMENT OF AGE 55. THE PLAN APPLIES ON THE SAME TERMS TO ALL U.S. SALARIED EMPLOYEES WHO RECEIVE A BONUS.

PRESENT VALUE PENSION CALCULATIONS



THE PRESENT VALUE OF ACCUMULATED BENEFITS SHOWN IN THE PENSION BENEFITS TABLE IS DETERMINED BY CONVERTING THE ANNUITY VALUES EARNED AS OF

YEAR END TO LUMP SUM VALUES PAYABLE AT AGE 60 (OR AT THE EMPLOYEES ACTUAL AGE, IF OLDER) USING THE MORTALITY TABLES AND INTEREST RATE (4 PERCENT) THAT WOULD APPLY TO A PARTICIPANT WHO WORKED THROUGH THE END OF 2009, AND RETIRED IN THE FIRST

QUARTER OF 2010.



THE ACTUAL LUMP SUM CONVERSION FACTORS THAT WILL APPLY WHEN EACH EXECUTIVE RETIRES COULD BE DIFFERENT. FOR EXECUTIVES WHO WERE NOT YET 60, THE PRESENT

VALUE AS OF YEAR-END 2009 OF EACH EXECUTIVES AGE 60 LUMP SUM IS DETERMINED USING A DISCOUNT RATE OF 6 PERCENT, THE RATE USED FOR VALUING PENSION OBLIGATIONS FOR PURPOSES OF THE CORPORATIONS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR 2009.

OTHER PLAN TERMS



ALL THREE PENSION PLANS REQUIRE ATTAINMENT OF AGE 55 AND COMPLETION OF 15 YEARS OF SERVICE TO BE ELIGIBLE FOR EARLY RETIREMENT. ALL NAMED EXECUTIVE

OFFICERS HAVE SATISFIED THIS REQUIREMENT.



THE NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS HAVE NOT RECEIVED ANY ADDITIONAL SERVICE CREDIT. ACTUAL SERVICE IS REFLECTED IN THE ABOVE TABLE.



THE EARLY RETIREMENT BENEFIT CONSISTS OF AN ANNUITY THAT IS UNDISCOUNTED FOR RETIREMENT AGES OF 60 YEARS OR OVER, WITH A DISCOUNT OF 5 PERCENT FOR EACH

YEAR UNDER AGE 60.

144

TABLE OF CONTENTS

INDEX TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS



IN ADDITION THE SOCIAL SECURITY OFFSET IS WAIVED FOR ANNUITY PAYMENTS SCHEDULED TO BE PAID PRIOR TO AGE 62.



BECAUSE EARLY RETIREMENT BENEFITS ARE SUBJECT TO A SMALLER DISCOUNT THAN A FULL ACTUARIAL EQUIVALENT DISCOUNT, THEY CAN BE MORE VALUABLE THAN THE

PRESENT VALUE OF THE EXECUTIVES EARNED NORMAL RETIREMENT AGE BENEFITS.



MESSRS. TILLERSON, DOLAN, AND CRAMER WERE ELIGIBLE FOR EARLY RETIREMENT PRIOR TO AGE 60 UNDER THE PLANS AS OF YEAR-END 2009.



THE TABLE BELOW SHOWS THE LUMP SUM EARLY RETIREMENT BENEFITS UNDER THE THREE PLANS FOR THE NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS WHO ARE UNDER AGE 60 AS OF YEAR-END

2009. THE LUMP SUM EARLY RETIREMENT BENEFITS FOR MESSRS. HUMPHREYS AND PRYOR AS OF YEAR-END 2009 ARE THE AMOUNTS SHOWN IN THE PENSION BENEFITS TABLE.

THE TABLE ABOVE SHOWS THE VALUE OF THE COMPANY CREDITS UNDER EXXONMOBILS NONQUALIFIED SUPPLEMENTAL SAVINGS PLAN. THE COMPANY CREDITS FOR 2009 ARE

ALSO INCLUDED IN THE SUMMARY COMPENSATION TABLE UNDER THE COLUMN LABELED ALL OTHER COMPENSATION.



THE AMOUNTS IN THE SUMMARY COMPENSATION TABLE INCLUDE BOTH COMPANY CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE TAX-QUALIFIED PLAN AND COMPANY CREDITS TO THE

NONQUALIFIED PLAN, WHEREAS THE REGISTRANT CONTRIBUTIONS IN THE TABLE ABOVE REPRESENT ONLY THE COMPANY CREDITS TO THE NONQUALIFIED PLAN.



THE AMOUNT OF COMPANY CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE TAX-QUALIFIED SAVINGS PLAN WAS LIMITED TO THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE CONTRIBUTION AND SALARY MAXIMUMS. FOR

THIS REASON, $17,150 WAS THE MAXIMUM COMPANY MATCH IN 2009 TO THE QUALIFIED SAVINGS PLAN.



THE AGGREGATE BALANCE AT THE LAST FISCAL YEAR END SHOWN ABOVE INCLUDES AMOUNTS REPORTED AS COMPANY CONTRIBUTIONS IN THE SUMMARY COMPENSATION

TABLE OF THE CURRENT STATEMENT AND IN PRIOR-YEAR PROXY STATEMENTS AS FOLLOWS: $580,090 FOR MR. TILLERSON; $170,300 FOR MR. HUMPHREYS; $42,000 FOR MR. DOLAN; $155,708 FOR MR. CRAMER; AND, $95,900 FOR MR. PRYOR.

145

TABLE OF CONTENTS

INDEX TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS



THE NONQUALIFIED SAVINGS PLAN PROVIDES EMPLOYEES WITH THE 7-PERCENT COMPANY-MATCHING CONTRIBUTION TO WHICH THEY WOULD OTHERWISE BE ENTITLED UNDER THE

QUALIFIED PLAN BUT FOR LIMITATIONS ON COVERED COMPENSATION AND TOTAL CONTRIBUTIONS UNDER THE INTERNAL REVENUE CODE.



ALL ELIGIBLE EMPLOYEES PARTICIPATE IN THE NONQUALIFIED PLAN ON THE SAME BASIS.



THE RATE AT WHICH THE NONQUALIFIED SAVINGS PLAN ACCOUNT BEARS INTEREST DURING THE TERM OF A PARTICIPANTS EMPLOYMENT IS 120 PERCENT OF THE LONG-TERM APPLICABLE

FEDERAL RATE.



THE TAX-QUALIFIED AND NONQUALIFIED SAVINGS PLANS ARE DESIGNED TO HELP ATTRACT AND RETAIN EMPLOYEES. THE MATCHING DESIGN IS INTENDED TO ENCOURAGE

EMPLOYEES TO CONTRIBUTE THEIR OWN FUNDS TO THE PLAN TO RECEIVE THE TAX BENEFITS AVAILABLE UNDER THE INTERNAL REVENUE CODE. THE SUPPLEMENTAL SAVINGS PLAN SERVES SIMILAR PURPOSES FOR SALARY OR CONTRIBUTIONS IN EXCESS OF THE INTERNAL REVENUE CODE

LIMITS REFERENCED ABOVE.

ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICES FOR RETIRED EMPLOYEE DIRECTORS



THE COMPANY PROVIDES CERTAIN ADMINISTRATIVE SUPPORT TO RETIRED EMPLOYEE DIRECTORS.



THE SUPPORT PROVIDED GENERALLY INVOLVES, BUT IS NOT LIMITED TO, ASSISTANCE WITH CORRESPONDENCE AND TRAVEL ARRANGEMENTS RELATING TO ACTIVITIES THE

RETIRED DIRECTORS ARE INVOLVED WITH THAT CONTINUE FROM THEIR EMPLOYMENT, SUCH AS BOARD POSITIONS WITH NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS. GIVEN THE NATURE OF THE SUPPORT PROVIDED, A RETIRED DIRECTORS SPOUSE MAY ALSO BENEFIT FROM THE SUPPORT PROVIDED.



THE COMPANY ALSO ALLOWS RETIRED EMPLOYEE DIRECTORS TO USE OTHERWISE VACANT OFFICE SPACE AT THE COMPANYS HEADQUARTERS.



IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO ESTIMATE THE FUTURE COST THAT MAY BE INCURRED BY THE COMPANY FOR PROVIDING THESE SERVICES TO MR. TILLERSON, WHO IS CURRENTLY

THE ONLY EMPLOYEE DIRECTOR.



THE AGGREGATE INCREMENTAL COST OF PROVIDING THESE SERVICES FOR ALL CURRENTLY COVERED PERSONS IS APPROXIMATELY $150,000 PER YEAR.



THIS AMOUNT REPRESENTS THE COMPENSATION AND BENEFIT COST FOR SUPPORT PERSONNEL ALLOCATED BASED ON THEIR ESTIMATED TIME DEDICATED TO PROVIDING THIS SERVICE, AS WELL AS

OTHER MISCELLANEOUS OFFICE SUPPORT COSTS.

HEALTH CARE BENEFITS



EXXONMOBIL DOES NOT PROVIDE ANY SPECIAL EXECUTIVE HEALTH CARE BENEFITS.



EXECUTIVES AND THEIR FAMILIES ARE ELIGIBLE TO PARTICIPATE IN THE COMPANYS HEALTH CARE PROGRAMS, INCLUDING MEDICAL, DENTAL, PRESCRIPTION DRUG, AND

VISION CARE, ON THE SAME BASIS AS ALL OTHER U.S. SALARIED EMPLOYEES.



THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THE PROGRAMS FOR BOTH CURRENT EMPLOYEES AND RETIREES DO NOT DISCRIMINATE IN SCOPE, TERMS, OR OPERATION IN FAVOR OF

EXECUTIVE OFFICERS.

UNUSED VACATION



ALL U.S. SALARIED EMPLOYEES ARE ENTITLED TO PAYMENT OF SALARY FOR ANY ACCUMULATED BUT UNUSED VACATION DAYS AT RETIREMENT OR OTHER TERMINATION OF

EMPLOYMENT.



PAYMENT FOR UNUSED VACATION IS INCLUDED IN FINAL PAYMENTS OF EARNED SALARY.

TERMINATION AND CHANGE IN CONTROL



EXXONMOBIL EXECUTIVE OFFICERS ARE NOT ENTITLED TO ANY ADDITIONAL PAYMENTS OR BENEFITS RELATING TO TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT OTHER THAN THE RETIREMENT

BENEFITS PREVIOUSLY DESCRIBED IN THE PRECEDING COMPENSATION TABLES AND NARRATIVE.



EXECUTIVES ARE AT-WILL EMPLOYEES OF THE COMPANY.

THEY DO NOT HAVE EMPLOYMENT CONTRACTS, A SEVERANCE PROGRAM, OR ANY BENEFITS

TRIGGERED BY A CHANGE IN CONTROL.



AS DISCUSSED IN GREATER DETAIL ABOVE, UNEXERCISED STOCK OPTIONS, UNVESTED RESTRICTED STOCK, AND ANY UNPAID PORTION OF AN ANNUAL BONUS ARE SUBJECT TO
