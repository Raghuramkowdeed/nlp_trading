ITEM 1.

BUSINESS.

EXXON MOBIL CORPORATION (EXXONMOBIL), FORMERLY NAMED EXXON CORPORATION, WAS INCORPORATED IN THE STATE OF NEW JERSEY IN 1882. ON NOVEMBER 30, 1999, MOBIL CORPORATION (MOBIL) BECAME A WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARY OF

EXXON CORPORATION (EXXON) AND EXXON CHANGED ITS NAME TO EXXON MOBIL CORPORATION.

DIVISIONS AND AFFILIATED COMPANIES OF EXXONMOBIL OPERATE OR MARKET PRODUCTS IN THE UNITED STATES AND ABOUT 200 OTHER COUNTRIES AND TERRITORIES. THEIR PRINCIPAL BUSINESS IS ENERGY, INVOLVING EXPLORATION

FOR, AND PRODUCTION OF, CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS, MANUFACTURE OF PETROLEUM PRODUCTS AND TRANSPORTATION AND SALE OF CRUDE OIL, NATURAL GAS AND PETROLEUM PRODUCTS. EXXONMOBIL IS A MAJOR MANUFACTURER AND MARKETER OF BASIC PETROCHEMICALS, INCLUDING

OLEFINS, AROMATICS, POLYETHYLENE AND POLYPROPYLENE PLASTICS AND A WIDE VARIETY OF SPECIALTY PRODUCTS. EXXONMOBIL ALSO HAS INTERESTS IN ELECTRIC POWER GENERATION FACILITIES. AFFILIATES OF EXXONMOBIL CONDUCT EXTENSIVE RESEARCH PROGRAMS IN SUPPORT OF

THESE BUSINESSES.

EXXON MOBIL CORPORATION HAS

SEVERAL DIVISIONS AND HUNDREDS OF AFFILIATES, MANY WITH NAMES THAT INCLUDE

EXXON

MOBIL, EXXON, ESSO

OR

MOBIL

. FOR CONVENIENCE AND SIMPLICITY, IN THIS REPORT THE TERMS

EXXONMOBIL, EXXON, ESSO

AND

MOBIL

, AS WELL AS

TERMS LIKE

CORPORATION, COMPANY, OUR, WE

AND

ITS

, ARE SOMETIMES USED AS ABBREVIATED REFERENCES TO SPECIFIC AFFILIATES OR GROUPS OF AFFILIATES. THE PRECISE MEANING DEPENDS ON THE CONTEXT IN QUESTION.

EXXONMOBILS WORLDWIDE ENVIRONMENTAL COSTS IN 2002

TOTALED $2,343 MILLION OF WHICH $1,054 MILLION WERE CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND $1,289 MILLION WERE OPERATING COSTS (INCLUDING $400 MILLION OF SITE RESTORATION AND ENVIRONMENTAL PROVISIONS). THESE COSTS WERE MOSTLY ASSOCIATED WITH AIR AND

WATER CONSERVATION. TOTAL COSTS FOR SUCH ACTIVITIES ARE EXPECTED TO INCREASE TO ABOUT $2.5 BILLION IN BOTH 2003 AND 2004 (WITH CAPITAL EXPENDITURES REPRESENTING ABOUT 50 PERCENT OF THE TOTAL). THE PROJECTED INCREASE IS PRIMARILY FOR

CAPITAL PROJECTS TO IMPLEMENT REFINING TECHNOLOGY TO MANUFACTURE LOW-SULFUR MOTOR FUELS IN MANY PARTS OF THE WORLD.

OPERATING DATA AND INDUSTRY SEGMENT INFORMATION FOR THE CORPORATION ARE CONTAINED ON PAGES 58, 59, 61 AND 67; INFORMATION ON OIL AND GAS

RESERVES IS CONTAINED ON PAGES 64 AND 65 AND INFORMATION ON COMPANY-SPONSORED RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES IS CONTAINED ON PAGE 45 OF THE FINANCIAL SECTION OF THIS REPORT. THE NUMBER OF REGULAR EMPLOYEES WAS 92.5 THOUSAND, 97.9 THOUSAND

FACTORS AFFECTING FUTURE

RESULTS

COMPETITIVE

FACTORS.

THE ENERGY AND PETROCHEMICAL INDUSTRIES ARE HIGHLY COMPETITIVE. THERE IS COMPETITION WITHIN THE INDUSTRIES AND ALSO WITH OTHER INDUSTRIES IN SUPPLYING THE ENERGY, FUEL AND CHEMICAL NEEDS OF INDUSTRY AND INDIVIDUAL

CONSUMERS. THE CORPORATION COMPETES WITH OTHER FIRMS IN THE SALE OR PURCHASE OF VARIOUS GOODS OR SERVICES IN MANY NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL MARKETS AND EMPLOYS ALL METHODS OF COMPETITION WHICH ARE LAWFUL AND APPROPRIATE FOR SUCH PURPOSES. A KEY

COMPONENT OF THE CORPORATIONS COMPETITIVE POSITION, PARTICULARLY GIVEN THE COMMODITY-BASED NATURE OF MANY OF ITS PRODUCTS, IS ITS ABILITY TO MANAGE OPERATING EXPENSES SUCCESSFULLY, WHICH REQUIRES CONTINUOUS MANAGEMENT FOCUS ON REDUCING UNIT

COSTS AND IMPROVING EFFICIENCY.

POLITICAL FACTORS.

THE OPERATIONS AND EARNINGS OF THE CORPORATION AND ITS AFFILIATES THROUGHOUT THE WORLD HAVE BEEN, AND MAY IN THE FUTURE BE, AFFECTED FROM TIME TO TIME IN VARYING DEGREE BY

1

TABLE OF CONTENTS

POLITICAL INSTABILITY AND BY OTHER POLITICAL DEVELOPMENTS AND LAWS AND REGULATIONS, SUCH AS FORCED DIVESTITURE OF ASSETS; RESTRICTIONS

ON PRODUCTION, IMPORTS AND EXPORTS; WAR OR OTHER INTERNATIONAL CONFLICTS; CIVIL UNREST AND LOCAL SECURITY CONCERNS THAT THREATEN THE SAFE OPERATION OF COMPANY FACILITIES; PRICE CONTROLS; TAX INCREASES AND RETROACTIVE TAX CLAIMS; EXPROPRIATION OF

PROPERTY; CANCELLATION OF CONTRACT RIGHTS; AND ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS. BOTH THE LIKELIHOOD OF SUCH OCCURRENCES AND THEIR OVERALL EFFECT UPON THE CORPORATION VARY GREATLY FROM COUNTRY TO COUNTRY AND ARE NOT PREDICTABLE.

INDUSTRY AND ECONOMIC

FACTORS.

THE OPERATIONS AND EARNINGS OF THE CORPORATION AND ITS AFFILIATES THROUGHOUT THE WORLD ARE AFFECTED BY LOCAL, REGIONAL AND GLOBAL EVENTS OR CONDITIONS THAT AFFECT SUPPLY AND DEMAND FOR OIL, NATURAL GAS, PETROLEUM

PRODUCTS, PETROCHEMICALS AND OTHER EXXONMOBIL PRODUCTS. THESE EVENTS OR CONDITIONS ARE GENERALLY NOT PREDICTABLE AND INCLUDE, AMONG OTHER THINGS, GENERAL ECONOMIC GROWTH RATES AND THE OCCURRENCE OF ECONOMIC RECESSIONS; THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW SUPPLY

SOURCES; ADHERENCE BY COUNTRIES TO OPEC QUOTAS; SUPPLY DISRUPTIONS; WEATHER, INCLUDING SEASONAL PATTERNS THAT AFFECT ENERGY DEMAND AND SEVERE WEATHER EVENTS THAT CAN DISRUPT OPERATIONS; TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES, INCLUDING ADVANCES IN EXPLORATION,

PRODUCTION, REFINING, AND PETROCHEMICAL MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY AND ADVANCES IN TECHNOLOGY RELATING TO ENERGY USAGE; CHANGES IN DEMOGRAPHICS, INCLUDING POPULATION GROWTH RATES AND CONSUMER PREFERENCES; AND THE COMPETITIVENESS OF ALTERNATIVE

HYDROCARBON OR OTHER ENERGY SOURCES OR PRODUCT SUBSTITUTES.

PROJECT FACTORS.

IN ADDITION TO THE FACTORS CITED ABOVE, THE ADVANCEMENT, COST AND RESULTS OF PARTICULAR EXXONMOBIL PROJECTS DEPEND ON THE OUTCOME OF NEGOTIATIONS WITH PARTNERS, GOVERNMENTS,

SUPPLIERS, CUSTOMERS OR OTHERS; CHANGES IN OPERATING CONDITIONS OR COSTS; AND THE OCCURRENCE OF UNFORESEEN TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES.

MARKET RISK FACTORS.

SEE PAGES 33 AND 34 OF THE FINANCIAL SECTION OF THIS REPORT FOR DISCUSSION OF THE

IMPACT OF MARKET RISKS, INFLATION AND OTHER UNCERTAINTIES.

PROJECTIONS, ESTIMATES AND DESCRIPTIONS OF EXXONMOBILS PLANS AND OBJECTIVES INCLUDED OR INCORPORATED IN ITEMS 1, 2, 7 AND 7A OF THIS REPORT ARE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS. ACTUAL FUTURE RESULTS, INCLUDING PROJECT

COMPLETION DATES, PRODUCTION RATES, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, COSTS AND BUSINESS PLANS COULD DIFFER MATERIALLY DUE TO, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE FACTORS DISCUSSED ABOVE AND ELSEWHERE IN THIS REPORT.

ON PAGES 62 THROUGH 67.

INFORMATION WITH REGARD TO OIL AND

GAS PRODUCING ACTIVITIES FOLLOWS.

1.

NET RESERVES OF CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS LIQUIDS (MILLIONS OF BARRELS) AND NATURAL GAS (BILLIONS OF CUBIC FEET) AT

YEAR-END 2002

ESTIMATED PROVED RESERVES ARE SHOWN ON PAGES 64 AND 65 OF THE FINANCIAL SECTION OF THIS REPORT. NO MAJOR DISCOVERY OR OTHER FAVORABLE OR ADVERSE EVENT HAS OCCURRED SINCE DECEMBER 31, 2002, THAT WOULD CAUSE A SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN THE

ESTIMATED PROVED RESERVES AS OF THAT DATE. FOR INFORMATION ON THE STANDARDIZED MEASURE OF DISCOUNTED FUTURE NET CASH FLOWS RELATING TO PROVED OIL AND GAS RESERVES, SEE PAGE 66 OF THE FINANCIAL SECTION OF THIS REPORT.

2

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE ESTIMATION

OF PROVED RESERVES IS AN ONGOING PROCESS BASED ON RIGOROUS TECHNICAL EVALUATIONS AND EXTRAPOLATIONS OF WELL INFORMATION SUCH AS FLOW RATES AND RESERVOIR PRESSURE DECLINES. IN CERTAIN DEEPWATER FIELDS, PROVED RESERVES ARE OCCASIONALLY RECORDED BEFORE

FLOW TESTS ARE CONDUCTED BECAUSE OF THE SAFETY AND COST IMPLICATIONS OF CONDUCTING THE TESTS. IN THOSE SITUATIONS, OTHER INDUSTRY ACCEPTED ANALYSES ARE USED SUCH AS INFORMATION FROM WELL LOGS, A THOROUGH PRESSURE AND FLUID SAMPLING PROGRAM,

CONVENTIONAL CORE DATA OBTAINED ACROSS THE ENTIRE RESERVOIR INTERVAL AND NEARBY ANALOG DATA. HISTORICALLY, PROVED RESERVES RECORDED USING THESE METHODS HAVE BEEN IMMATERIAL WHEN COMPARED TO THE CORPORATIONS TOTAL PROVED RESERVES AND HAVE ALSO

BEEN VALIDATED BY SUBSEQUENT FLOW TESTS OR ACTUAL PRODUCTION LEVELS. IN ADDITION, THE CORPORATION RECORDS PROVED RESERVES IN CONJUNCTION WITH SIGNIFICANT FUNDING COMMITMENTS MADE TOWARDS DEVELOPMENT OF THE RESERVES.

2.    ESTIMATES OF TOTAL NET PROVED OIL AND GAS

RESERVES FILED WITH OTHER FEDERAL AGENCIES

DURING 2002, EXXONMOBIL FILED PROVED RESERVES ESTIMATES WITH THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY ON FORMS EIA-23 AND EIA-28. THE INFORMATION ON FORM EIA-28 IS PRESENTED ON THE SAME BASIS AS THE REGISTRANTS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K

FOR 2001, WHICH SHOWS EXXONMOBILS NET INTERESTS IN ALL LIQUIDS AND GAS RESERVE VOLUMES AND CHANGES THERETO FROM BOTH EXXONMOBIL-OPERATED PROPERTIES AND PROPERTIES OPERATED BY OTHERS. THE DATA ON FORM EIA-23, ALTHOUGH CONSISTENT WITH THE DATA

ON FORM EIA-28, IS PRESENTED ON A DIFFERENT BASIS, AND INCLUDES 100 PERCENT OF THE OIL AND GAS VOLUMES FROM EXXONMOBIL-OPERATED PROPERTIES ONLY, REGARDLESS OF THE COMPANYS NET INTEREST. IN ADDITION, FORM EIA-23 INFORMATION DOES NOT

INCLUDE GAS PLANT LIQUIDS. THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE OIL AND GAS RESERVES REPORTED ON EIA-23 AND THOSE REPORTED IN THE REGISTRANTS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR 2001 EXCEEDS FIVE PERCENT.

3.    AVERAGE SALES PRICES AND PRODUCTION COSTS PER

UNIT OF PRODUCTION

REFERENCE IS MADE TO

PAGE 62 OF THE FINANCIAL SECTION OF THIS REPORT. AVERAGE SALES PRICES HAVE BEEN CALCULATED BY USING SALES QUANTITIES FROM OUR OWN PRODUCTION AS THE DIVISOR. AVERAGE PRODUCTION COSTS HAVE BEEN COMPUTED BY USING NET PRODUCTION QUANTITIES FOR THE

DIVISOR. THE VOLUMES OF CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS LIQUIDS (NGL) PRODUCTION USED FOR THIS COMPUTATION ARE SHOWN IN THE RESERVES TABLE ON PAGE 64 OF THE FINANCIAL SECTION OF THIS REPORT. THE NET PRODUCTION VOLUMES OF NATURAL GAS AVAILABLE FOR

SALE USED IN THIS CALCULATION ARE SHOWN ON PAGE 67 OF THE FINANCIAL SECTION OF THIS REPORT. THE VOLUMES OF NATURAL GAS WERE CONVERTED TO OIL-EQUIVALENT BARRELS BASED ON A CONVERSION FACTOR OF SIX THOUSAND CUBIC FEET PER BARREL.

7.    SUMMARY OF ACREAGE TERMS IN KEY AREAS

UNITED STATES

OIL AND GAS LEASES HAVE AN EXPLORATION PERIOD RANGING FROM ONE TO TEN YEARS, AND A PRODUCTION PERIOD THAT NORMALLY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL PRODUCTION CEASES. IN SOME INSTANCES, A FEE INTEREST IS ACQUIRED WHERE BOTH THE

SURFACE AND THE UNDERLYING MINERAL INTERESTS ARE OWNED OUTRIGHT.

CANADA

EXPLORATION

PERMITS ARE GRANTED FOR VARYING PERIODS OF TIME WITH RENEWALS POSSIBLE. PRODUCTION LEASES ARE HELD AS LONG AS THERE IS PRODUCTION ON THE LEASE. THE MAJORITY OF COLD LAKE LEASES WERE TAKEN FOR AN INITIAL 21-YEAR TERM IN 1968-1969 AND RENEWED FOR A

SECOND 21-YEAR TERM IN 1989-1990. THE EXPLORATION ACREAGE IN EASTERN CANADA IS CURRENTLY HELD BY WORK COMMITMENTS OF VARIOUS AMOUNTS.

EUROPE

FRANCE

EXPLORATION PERMITS ARE GRANTED FOR PERIODS OF THREE TO FIVE YEARS, AND ARE RENEWABLE UP TO TWO TIMES ACCOMPANIED BY SUBSTANTIAL ACREAGE

RELINQUISHMENTS: 50 PERCENT OF THE ACREAGE AT FIRST RENEWAL; 25 PERCENT OF THE REMAINING ACREAGE AT SECOND RENEWAL. A 1994 LAW REQUIRES A BIDDING PROCESS PRIOR TO GRANTING OF AN EXPLORATION PERMIT. UPON DISCOVERY OF COMMERCIAL HYDROCARBONS, A

PRODUCTION CONCESSION IS GRANTED FOR UP TO 50 YEARS, RENEWABLE IN PERIODS OF 25 YEARS EACH.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

GERMANY

EXPLORATION CONCESSIONS ARE GRANTED FOR AN INITIAL MAXIMUM PERIOD OF FIVE YEARS WITH POSSIBLE EXTENSIONS OF

UP TO THREE YEARS FOR AN INDEFINITE PERIOD. EXTENSIONS ARE SUBJECT TO SPECIFIC, MINIMUM WORK COMMITMENTS. PRODUCTION LICENSES ARE NORMALLY GRANTED FOR 20 TO 25 YEARS WITH MULTIPLE POSSIBLE EXTENSIONS AS LONG AS THERE IS PRODUCTION ON THE LICENSE.

ITALY

EXPLORATION PERMITS ARE AWARDED FOR A PERIOD OF SIX YEARS,

SUBJECT TO SPECIFIC, MINIMUM WORK COMMITMENTS (AN EXPLORATION WELL IS USUALLY INCLUDED). IF PERMIT OBLIGATIONS HAVE BEEN FULFILLED, THE TITLEHOLDER OF THE PERMIT IS ENTITLED TO TWO SUBSEQUENT EXTENSIONS OF THREE YEARS EACH. THE PROGRAM OF BOTH THE

FIRST AND SECOND EXTENSION PERIOD MUST INCLUDE THE DRILLING OF A FURTHER WELL. PRODUCTION LICENSES ARE AWARDED FOR A PERIOD OF 20 YEARS UPON DISCOVERY OF COMMERCIAL HYDROCARBONS. AFTER 15 YEARS, THE LICENSE HOLDER CAN APPLY FOR AN EXTENSION OF

TEN YEARS. AFTER SEVEN YEARS OF THE FIRST EXTENSION PERIOD, THE LICENSE HOLDER CAN APPLY FOR A FURTHER EXTENSION OF FIVE YEARS.

NETHERLANDS

UNDER THE NEW MINING LAW, EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2003, EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION LICENSES FOR BOTH ONSHORE AND OFFSHORE AREAS ARE ISSUED

FOR A PERIOD OF TIME NECESSARY TO PERFORM THE ACTIVITIES FOR WHICH THE LICENSE IS ISSUED. LICENSE CONDITIONS ARE STIPULATED IN THE MINING LAW.

EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION RIGHTS GRANTED PRIOR TO JANUARY 1, 2003 REMAIN SUBJECT TO THEIR EXISTING TERMS, AND DIFFER SLIGHTLY FOR ONSHORE

AND OFFSHORE AREAS.

ONSHORE:  EXPLORATION LICENSES WERE ISSUED FOR A PERIOD OF TIME NECESSARY TO PERFORM THE ACTIVITIES FOR WHICH THE LICENSE WAS ISSUED. PRODUCTION CONCESSIONS ARE GRANTED AFTER DISCOVERIES HAVE BEEN MADE, UNDER CONDITIONS

THAT ARE NEGOTIATED WITH THE GOVERNMENT. NORMALLY, THEY ARE FIELD-LIFE CONCESSIONS COVERING AN AREA DEFINED BY HYDROCARBON OCCURRENCES.

OFFSHORE: EXPLORATION LICENSES ISSUED BETWEEN 1976 AND 1996 WERE FOR A TEN-YEAR PERIOD, WITH RELINQUISHMENT OF ABOUT 50 PERCENT OF

THE ORIGINAL AREA REQUIRED AT THE END OF SIX YEARS. EXPLORATION LICENSES GRANTED AFTER THAT TIME WERE FOR A PERIOD OF TIME NECESSARY TO PERFORM THE ACTIVITIES FOR WHICH THE PERMIT WAS ISSUED. PRODUCTION LICENSES ARE NORMALLY ISSUED FOR A 40-YEAR

PERIOD.

NORWAY

LICENSES ISSUED PRIOR TO 1972 WERE FOR AN INITIAL PERIOD OF

SIX YEARS AND AN EXTENSION PERIOD OF 40 YEARS, WITH RELINQUISHMENT OF AT LEAST ONE-FOURTH OF THE ORIGINAL AREA REQUIRED AT THE END OF THE SIXTH YEAR AND ANOTHER ONE-FOURTH AT THE END OF THE NINTH YEAR. LICENSES ISSUED BETWEEN 1972 AND 1997 WERE

FOR AN INITIAL PERIOD OF UP TO TEN YEARS AND AN EXTENSION PERIOD OF UP TO 30 YEARS, WITH RELINQUISHMENT OF AT LEAST ONE-HALF OF THE ORIGINAL AREA REQUIRED AT THE END OF THE SIXTH YEAR. LICENSES ISSUED AFTER JULY 1, 1997 HAVE AN INITIAL PERIOD OF

FOUR TO TEN YEARS AND A NORMAL EXTENSION PERIOD OF UP TO 30 YEARS OR IN SPECIAL CASES OF UP TO 50 YEARS, AND WITH RELINQUISHMENT OF AT LEAST ONE-HALF OF THE ORIGINAL AREA REQUIRED AT THE END OF THE INITIAL PERIOD.

UNITED KINGDOM

ACREAGE TERMS ARE FIXED BY THE GOVERNMENT AND ARE

PERIODICALLY CHANGED. FOR EXAMPLE, THE REGULATIONS GOVERNING LICENSES ISSUED BETWEEN 1996 AND 1998 PROVIDED FOR AN INITIAL TERM OF THREE YEARS WITH POSSIBLE EXTENSIONS OF SIX, 15 AND 24 YEARS FOR A LICENSE PERIOD OF 45 MORE YEARS. AFTER THE SECOND

EXTENSION, THE LICENSE MUST BE SURRENDERED IN PART. LICENSES ISSUED IN 2002 AS PART OF THE 20TH LICENSING ROUND HAVE AN INITIAL TERM OF FOUR YEARS WITH A SECOND TERM EXTENSION OF FOUR YEARS. THERE IS A MANDATORY RELINQUISHMENT OF ALL ACREAGE THAT IS

NOT COVERED BY A DEVELOPMENT PLAN AT THE END OF THE SECOND TERM.

ASIA-PACIFIC

AUSTRALIA

ONSHORE:  ACREAGE TERMS ARE FIXED BY THE INDIVIDUAL STATE AND TERRITORY GOVERNMENTS. THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS VARY

SIGNIFICANTLY BETWEEN THE STATES AND TERRITORIES. EXPLORATION PERMITS ARE NORMALLY GRANTED FOR TWO TO SIX YEARS (IN SOME STATES THE RESPONSIBLE MINISTER FIXES THE TERM) WITH POSSIBLE RENEWALS AND RELINQUISHMENT. PRODUCTION LICENSES IN SOUTH

AUSTRALIA ARE GRANTED FOR AN UNLIMITED TERM, SUBJECT TO MEETING STIPULATED CONDITIONS IN THE LICENSE, INCLUDING PRODUCTION AND EXPENDITURE REQUIREMENTS. PRODUCTION LICENSES IN QUEENSLAND ARE GRANTED FOR VARYING PERIODS CONSISTENT WITH EXPECTED FIELD

LIVES, WITH RENEWALS ON A SIMILAR BASIS.

OFFSHORE:  EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION ACTIVITIES BEYOND THE THREE NAUTICAL MILE LIMIT ARE GOVERNED BY FEDERAL LEGISLATION APPLICABLE TO ALL EXXONMOBILS OFFSHORE ACREAGE. EXPLORATION PERMITS GRANTED BEFORE JANUARY 1,

2003 WERE ISSUED FOR SIX YEARS WITH THREE POSSIBLE FIVE-YEAR RENEWAL PERIODS. EXPLORATION PERMITS GRANTED AFTER THAT DATE ARE ISSUED FOR SIX YEARS WITH TWO POSSIBLE FIVE-YEAR RENEWAL PERIODS. A 50 PERCENT RELINQUISHMENT OF REMAINING AREA IS

MANDATORY AT THE END OF EACH RENEWAL PERIOD. RETENTION LEASES MAY BE GRANTED FOR RESOURCES THAT ARE NOT COMMERCIALLY VIABLE AT THE TIME OF APPLICATION, BUT ARE EXPECTED TO BECOME COMMERCIALLY VIABLE WITHIN 15 YEARS. THESE ARE GRANTED FOR PERIODS OF

FIVE YEARS AND RENEWALS MAY BE REQUESTED. PRIOR TO SEPTEMBER 1998, PRODUCTION LICENSES WERE GRANTED INITIALLY FOR 21 YEARS, WITH A FURTHER RENEWAL OF 21 YEARS AND THEREAFTER RENEWALS AT THE DISCRETION OF THE JOINT AUTHORITY, COMPRISING FEDERAL AND

STATE MINISTERS. EFFECTIVE FROM SEPTEMBER 1998, NEW PRODUCTION LICENSES ARE GRANTED INDEFINITELY, I.E., FOR THE LIFE OF THE FIELD (IF NO OPERATIONS FOR THE RECOVERY OF PETROLEUM HAVE BEEN CARRIED ON FOR FIVE YEARS, THE LICENSE MAY BE

TERMINATED).

INDONESIA

EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION ACTIVITIES IN INDONESIA ARE

GENERALLY GOVERNED BY COOPERATION CONTRACTS, USUALLY IN THE FORM OF A PRODUCTION SHARING CONTRACT, NEGOTIATED WITH THE NATIONAL OIL COMPANY. PURSUANT TO THE 2001 OIL AND GAS LAW, THE NATIONAL OIL COMPANYS ROLE AS MANAGER OF UPSTREAM ACTIVITIES

UNDER EXISTING AND FUTURE CONTRACTS WAS TRANSFERRED, EFFECTIVE JULY 16, 2002, TO AN UPSTREAM SUPERVISORY BODY (LEGALLY REFERRED TO AS THE BADAN PELAKSANA, COMMONLY KNOWN AS BPMIGAS). EXISTING COOPERATION CONTRACTS ARE IN THE PROCESS OF

BEING AMENDED TO REFLECT THE TRANSFER OF AUTHORITY TO BPMIGAS; HOWEVER, THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THE EXISTING CONTRACTS ARE NOT BEING CHANGED.

JAPAN

THE MINING LAW PROVIDES FOR THE GRANTING OF CONCESSIONS THAT CONVEY EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION RIGHTS. EXPLORATION RIGHTS ARE GRANTED FOR

AN INITIAL TWO-YEAR PERIOD, AND MAY BE EXTENDED FOR TWO TWO-YEAR PERIODS FOR GAS AND THREE TWO-YEAR PERIODS FOR OIL. PRODUCTION RIGHTS HAVE NO FIXED TERM AND CONTINUE UNTIL ABANDONMENT SO LONG AS THE RIGHTS HOLDER IS FULFILLING ITS OBLIGATIONS.

MALAYSIA

EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION ACTIVITIES ARE GOVERNED BY

PRODUCTION SHARING CONTRACTS NEGOTIATED WITH THE NATIONAL OIL COMPANY. THE MORE RECENT CONTRACTS HAVE AN OVERALL TERM OF 24 TO 38 YEARS WITH POSSIBLE EXTENSIONS TO THE EXPLORATION OR DEVELOPMENT PERIODS. THE EXPLORATION PERIOD IS FIVE TO SEVEN YEARS

WITH THE POSSIBILITY OF EXTENSIONS, AFTER WHICH TIME AREAS WITH NO COMMERCIAL DISCOVERIES MUST BE RELINQUISHED. THE DEVELOPMENT PERIOD IS FROM FOUR TO SIX YEARS FROM COMMERCIAL DISCOVERY, WITH THE POSSIBILITY OF EXTENSIONS UNDER SPECIAL

CIRCUMSTANCES. AREAS FROM WHICH COMMERCIAL PRODUCTION HAS NOT STARTED BY THE END OF THE DEVELOPMENT PERIOD MUST BE RELINQUISHED IF NO EXTENSION IS GRANTED. THE TOTAL PRODUCTION PERIOD IS 15 TO 25 YEARS FROM FIRST COMMERCIAL LIFTING, NOT TO EXCEED

THE OVERALL TERM OF THE CONTRACT.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

PAPUA NEW GUINEA

EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION ACTIVITIES ARE GOVERNED BY THE OIL AND GAS ACT. PETROLEUM PROSPECTING LICENSES ARE

GRANTED FOR AN INITIAL TERM OF SIX YEARS WITH A FIVE-YEAR EXTENSION POSSIBLE. GENERALLY, A 50 PERCENT RELINQUISHMENT OF THE LICENSE AREA IS REQUIRED AT THE END OF THE INITIAL SIX YEAR-TERM, IF EXTENDED. PETROLEUM DEVELOPMENT LICENSES ARE GRANTED FOR

AN INITIAL 25-YEAR PERIOD. AN EXTENSION OF UP TO 20 YEARS MAY BE GRANTED AT THE MINISTERS DISCRETION. PETROLEUM RETENTION LICENSES MAY BE GRANTED FOR GAS RESOURCES THAT ARE NOT COMMERCIALLY VIABLE AT THE TIME OF APPLICATION, BUT MAY BECOME

COMMERCIALLY VIABLE. PETROLEUM RETENTION LICENSES ARE GRANTED FOR FIVE-YEAR TERMS, AND MAY BE EXTENDED TWICE FOR A MAXIMUM RETENTION TIME OF 15 YEARS.

RUSSIA

ACREAGE TERMS ARE FIXED BY THE PRODUCTION SHARING AGREEMENT (PSA) EXECUTED IN 1996 BETWEEN THE RUSSIAN GOVERNMENT AND THE SAKHALIN I

CONSORTIUM, OF WHICH EXXONMOBIL IS THE OPERATOR. THE TERM OF THE PSA IS 20 YEARS FROM THE DECLARATION OF COMMERCIALITY, OR UNTIL 2021. THE TERM MAY BE EXTENDED THEREAFTER IN 10-YEAR INCREMENTS AS SPECIFIED IN THE PSA.

THAILAND

THE PETROLEUM ACT OF 1971 ALLOWS PRODUCTION UNDER

EXXONMOBILS CONCESSION FOR 30 YEARS (THROUGH 2021) WITH A POSSIBLE TEN-YEAR EXTENSION AT TERMS GENERALLY PREVALENT AT THE TIME.

AFRICA

ANGOLA

EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION ACTIVITIES ARE GOVERNED BY PRODUCTION SHARING AGREEMENTS WITH AN INITIAL EXPLORATION TERM OF FOUR YEARS AND AN

OPTIONAL SECOND PHASE OF TWO TO THREE YEARS. THE PRODUCTION PERIOD IS FOR 25 YEARS AND AGREEMENTS GENERALLY PROVIDE FOR A NEGOTIATED EXTENSION.

CAMEROON

EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION ACTIVITIES ARE GOVERNED BY VARIOUS AGREEMENTS NEGOTIATED WITH THE NATIONAL OIL COMPANY AND THE GOVERNMENT OF

CAMEROON. EXPLORATION PERMITS ARE GRANTED FOR TERMS FROM FOUR TO 16 YEARS AND ARE GENERALLY RENEWABLE FOR MULTIPLE PERIODS UP TO FOUR YEARS EACH. UPON COMMERCIAL DISCOVERY, MINING CONCESSIONS ARE ISSUED FOR A PERIOD OF 25 YEARS WITH ONE 25-YEAR

EXTENSION.

EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION ACTIVITIES IN

THE DEEPWATER OFFSHORE AREAS ARE TYPICALLY GOVERNED BY PRODUCTION SHARING CONTRACTS (PSCS) WITH THE NATIONAL OIL COMPANY. THE NATIONAL OIL COMPANY HOLDS THE UNDERLYING OIL PROSPECTING LICENSE (OPL) AND ANY RESULTING OIL MINING LEASE (OML). THE TERMS

OF THE PSCS ARE GENERALLY 30 YEARS, INCLUDING A TEN-YEAR EXPLORATION PERIOD (AN INITIAL EXPLORATION PHASE PLUS ONE OR TWO OPTIONAL PERIODS) COVERED BY AN OPL. UPON COMMERCIAL DISCOVERY, AN OPL MAY BE CONVERTED TO AN OML. PARTIAL RELINQUISHMENT IS

REQUIRED UNDER THE PSC AT THE END OF THE TEN-YEAR EXPLORATION PERIOD, AND OMLS HAVE A 20-YEAR PRODUCTION PERIOD THAT MAY BE EXTENDED.

SOME EXPLORATION ACTIVITIES ARE CARRIED OUT IN DEEPWATER BY JOINT VENTURES WITH INDIGENOUS COMPANIES HOLDING INTERESTS IN AN OPL. OPLS IN

DEEPWATER OFFSHORE AREAS ARE VALID FOR TEN YEARS AND ARE NON-RENEWABLE, WHILE IN ALL OTHER AREAS THE LICENSES ARE FOR FIVE YEARS AND ALSO ARE NON-RENEWABLE. DEMONSTRATING A COMMERCIAL DISCOVERY IS THE BASIS FOR CONVERSION OF AN OPL TO AN OML.

OMLS GRANTED PRIOR TO THE 1969 PETROLEUM ACT

(I.E., UNDER THE MINERALS OILS ACT 1914, REPEALED BY THE 1969 PETROLEUM ACT) WERE FOR 30 YEARS ONSHORE AND 40 YEARS IN OFFSHORE AREAS AND ARE RENEWABLE UPON 12 MONTHS WRITTEN NOTICE, FOR FURTHER PERIODS OF 30 AND 40 YEARS, RESPECTIVELY.

OMLS GRANTED UNDER THE 1969 PETROLEUM ACT, WHICH

INCLUDE ALL DEEPWATER OMLS, HAVE A MAXIMUM TERM OF 20 YEARS WITHOUT DISTINCTION FOR ONSHORE OR OFFSHORE LOCATION AND ARE RENEWABLE, UPON 12 MONTHS WRITTEN NOTICE, FOR ANOTHER PERIOD OF 20 YEARS. OMLS NOT HELD BY THE NATIONAL OIL COMPANY ARE

ALSO SUBJECT TO A MANDATORY 50 PERCENT RELINQUISHMENT AFTER THE FIRST TEN YEARS OF THEIR DURATION.

THE MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING (MOU) DEFINING COMMERCIAL TERMS APPLICABLE TO EXISTING OIL PRODUCTION WAS RENEGOTIATED AND EXECUTED IN

2000. THE MOU IS EFFECTIVE FOR A MINIMUM OF THREE YEARS WITH POSSIBLE EXTENSIONS ON MUTUAL AGREEMENT AND IS TERMINABLE ON ONE CALENDAR YEARS NOTICE.

SYNCRUDE OPERATIONS

SYNCRUDE IS A JOINT-VENTURE ESTABLISHED TO RECOVER SHALLOW

DEPOSITS OF TAR SANDS USING OPEN-PIT MINING METHODS, TO EXTRACT THE CRUDE BITUMEN, AND TO PRODUCE A HIGH-QUALITY, LIGHT (32 DEGREE API), SWEET, SYNTHETIC CRUDE OIL. THE SYNCRUDE OPERATION, LOCATED NEAR FORT MCMURRAY, ALBERTA, CANADA, EXPLOITS A

PORTION OF THE ATHABASCA OIL SANDS DEPOSIT. THE LOCATION IS READILY ACCESSIBLE BY PUBLIC ROAD. THE PRODUCED SYNTHETIC CRUDE OIL IS SHIPPED FROM THE SYNCRUDE SITE TO EDMONTON, ALBERTA BY ALBERTA OIL SANDS PIPELINE LTD. SINCE START-UP IN 1978,

SYNCRUDE HAS PRODUCED ABOUT 1.4 BILLION BARRELS OF SYNTHETIC CRUDE OIL. IMPERIAL OIL LIMITED IS THE OWNER OF A 25 PERCENT INTEREST IN THE JOINT-VENTURE. EXXON MOBIL CORPORATION HAS A 69.6 PERCENT INTEREST IN IMPERIAL OIL LIMITED.

OPERATING LICENSE AND LEASES

SYNCRUDE HAS AN OPERATING LICENSE ISSUED BY THE PROVINCE OF

ALBERTA WHICH IS EFFECTIVE UNTIL 2035. THIS LICENSE PERMITS SYNCRUDE TO MINE TAR SANDS AND PRODUCE SYNTHETIC CRUDE OIL FROM APPROVED DEVELOPMENT AREAS ON TAR SANDS LEASES. SYNCRUDE HOLDS EIGHT TAR SANDS LEASES COVERING APPROXIMATELY 252,000 ACRES IN

THE ATHABASCA OIL SANDS DEPOSIT. ISSUED BY THE PROVINCE OF ALBERTA, THE LEASES ARE AUTOMATICALLY RENEWABLE AS LONG AS TAR SANDS OPERATIONS ARE ONGOING OR THE LEASES ARE PART OF AN APPROVED DEVELOPMENT PLAN. SYNCRUDE LEASES 10, 12, 17, 22 AND 34

(CONTAINING PROVEN RESERVES) AND LEASES 29, 30 AND 31 (CONTAINING NO PROVEN RESERVES) ARE INCLUDED WITHIN A DEVELOPMENT PLAN APPROVED BY THE PROVINCE OF ALBERTAS DEPARTMENT OF RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT. THERE WERE NO KNOWN PREVIOUS COMMERCIAL

OPERATIONS ON THESE LEASES PRIOR TO THE START-UP OF OPERATIONS IN 1978.

OPERATIONS, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT

OPERATIONS AT SYNCRUDE INVOLVE THREE MAIN PROCESSES: OPEN PIT MINING, EXTRACTION OF CRUDE BITUMEN AND UPGRADING OF CRUDE BITUMEN INTO SYNTHETIC CRUDE OIL. IN THE BASE MINE (LEASE 17), THE MINING AND TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM USES

DRAGLINES, BUCKETWHEEL RECLAIMERS AND BELT CONVEYORS. IN THE NORTH MINE (LEASES 17 AND 22) AND IN THE AURORA MINE (LEASES 10, 12 AND 34), TRUCK, SHOVEL AND HYDROTRANSPORT SYSTEMS ARE USED. PRODUCTION FROM THE AURORA MINE COMMENCED IN 2000. THE

EXTRACTION FACILITIES, WHICH SEPARATES CRUDE BITUMEN FROM SAND, ARE CAPABLE OF PROCESSING APPROXIMATELY 545,000 TONS OF TAR SANDS A DAY, PRODUCING 110 MILLION BARRELS OF CRUDE BITUMEN A YEAR. THIS REPRESENTS RECOVERY CAPABILITY OF ABOUT 92 PERCENT

OF THE CRUDE BITUMEN CONTAINED IN THE MINED TAR SANDS.

CRUDE BITUMEN EXTRACTED FROM TAR SANDS IS REFINED TO A MARKETABLE HYDROCARBON PRODUCT THROUGH A COMBINATION OF CARBON REMOVAL IN TWO LARGE, HIGH-TEMPERATURE, FLUID-COKING VESSELS AND BY HYDROGEN ADDITION IN HIGH-TEMPERATURE,

HIGH-PRESSURE, HYDROCRACKING VESSELS. THESE PROCESSES REMOVE CARBON AND SULFUR AND REFORMULATE THE CRUDE INTO A LOW VISCOSITY, LOW SULFUR, HIGH-QUALITY SYNTHETIC CRUDE OIL PRODUCT. IN 2002, THIS UPGRADING PROCESS YIELDED 0.863 BARRELS OF SYNTHETIC

CRUDE OIL PER BARREL OF CRUDE BITUMEN. IN 2002 ABOUT 60 PERCENT OF THE SYNTHETIC CRUDE OIL WAS PROCESSED BY EDMONTON AREA REFINERIES AND THE REMAINING 40 PERCENT WAS PIPELINED TO REFINERIES IN EASTERN CANADA AND THE MID-WESTERN UNITED

STATES. ELECTRICITY IS PROVIDED TO SYNCRUDE BY A 270 MEGAWATT ELECTRICITY GENERATING PLANT AND AN 80 MEGAWATT ELECTRICITY GENERATING PLANT, BOTH LOCATED AT SYNCRUDE. THE GENERATING PLANTS

15

TABLE OF CONTENTS

ARE OWNED BY THE SYNCRUDE PARTICIPANTS. IMPERIAL OIL LIMITEDS 25 PERCENT SHARE OF NET INVESTMENT IN PLANT, PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT,

INCLUDING SURFACE MINING FACILITIES, TRANSPORTATION EQUIPMENT AND UPGRADING FACILITIES WAS ABOUT $1.0 BILLION AT YEAR END 2002.

SYNTHETIC CRUDE OIL RESERVES

THE CRUDE BITUMEN IS CONTAINED WITHIN THE UNCONSOLIDATED SANDS OF THE MCMURRAY FORMATION. ORE BODIES ARE BURIED BENEATH 50 TO 150 FEET OF

OVERBURDEN, HAVE BITUMEN GRADES RANGING FROM 4 TO 14 WEIGHT PERCENT AND ORE THICKNESS OF 115 TO 160 FEET. ESTIMATES OF SYNTHETIC CRUDE OIL RESERVES ARE BASED ON DETAILED GEOLOGICAL AND ENGINEERING ASSESSMENTS OF IN-PLACE CRUDE BITUMEN VOLUME,

THE MINING PLAN, HISTORICAL EXTRACTION RECOVERY AND UPGRADING YIELD FACTORS, INSTALLED PLANT OPERATING CAPACITY AND OPERATING APPROVAL LIMITS. THE IN-PLACE VOLUME, DEPTH AND GRADE ARE ESTABLISHED THROUGH EXTENSIVE AND CLOSELY SPACED CORE DRILLING.

PROVEN RESERVES INCLUDE THE OPERATING BASE AND NORTH MINES AND THE AURORA MINE. IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE APPROVED MINING PLAN, THERE ARE AN ESTIMATED 3,295 MILLION TONS OF EXTRACTABLE TAR SANDS IN THE BASE AND NORTH MINES, WITH AN AVERAGE BITUMEN

GRADE OF 10.4 WEIGHT PERCENT. IN ADDITION, AT THE AURORA MINE, THERE ARE AN ESTIMATED 4,050 MILLION TONS OF EXTRACTABLE TAR SANDS AT AN AVERAGE BITUMEN GRADE OF 11.3 WEIGHT PERCENT. AFTER DEDUCTING ROYALTIES PAYABLE TO THE PROVINCE OF ALBERTA,

IMPERIAL OIL LIMITED ESTIMATES THAT ITS 25 PERCENT NET SHARE OF PROVEN RESERVES AT YEAR END 2002 WAS EQUIVALENT TO 800 MILLION BARRELS OF SYNTHETIC CRUDE OIL.

IN 2001, THE SYNCRUDE OWNERS ENDORSED A FURTHER DEVELOPMENT OF THE SYNCRUDE RESOURCE IN THE AREA AND EXPANSION OF THE UPGRADING

FACILITIES. THE SYNCRUDE AURORA 2 AND UPGRADER EXPANSION 1 PROJECT ADDS A REMOTE MINING TRAIN AND EXPANDS THE CENTRAL PROCESSING AND UPGRADING PLANT. THIS EXPANSION WILL LEAD TO TOTAL PRODUCTION OF ABOUT 370 THOUSAND BARRELS OF SYNTHETIC CRUDE OIL

PER DAY (GROSS) WHEN COMPLETED.

ITEM 3.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.

EXXONMOBIL OIL CORPORATION (EMOC) HAS SETTLED A PREVIOUSLY-REPORTED MATTER RELATING TO CLAIMS ARISING FROM A 1991 OIL SPILL

FROM AN EMOC PIPELINE INTO THE SANTA CLARA RIVER IN CALIFORNIA. THE CONSENT DECREE IN THIS MATTER WAS APPROVED BY THE U.S. DISTRICT COURT, CENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA, ON OCTOBER 28, 2002, IN THE CASE CAPTIONED UNITED STATES OF AMERICA AND PEOPLE

OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA V. EXXONMOBIL OIL CORPORATION (FILED ON SEPTEMBER 20, 2002, ALONG WITH THE CONSENT DECREE AS SIGNED BY ALL THE PARTIES). ON DECEMBER 30, 2002, EMOC DISCHARGED ALL ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE CONSENT DECREE BY PAYING A TOTAL

OF $4,721,831 TO VARIOUS FEDERAL AND STATE AGENCIES. OF THIS AMOUNT, $850,000 WAS PAYMENT OF CIVIL PENALTIES TO THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE AND THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND GAME, AND THE OTHER AMOUNTS COVERED NATURAL RESOURCE DAMAGE

COMPENSATION, EXPENSE REIMBURSEMENT AND SUPPLEMENTAL ENVIRONMENTAL PROJECTS.

IN ANOTHER PREVIOUSLY-REPORTED MATTER, EMOC PREVAILED IN AN ARBITRATION PROCEEDING RELATING TO NOTICES OF VIOLATION (NOVS) ISSUED BY THE ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY REGARDING THE FORMER

MOBIL REFINERY IN PAULSBORO, NEW JERSEY. IN AUGUST 2002, THE ARBITRATORS HELD THAT THE COMPANY THAT PURCHASED THE REFINERY FROM EMOC WAS CONTRACTUALLY OBLIGATED UNDER THE PURCHASE AGREEMENT TO INDEMNIFY EMOC FOR ANY PENALTIES ARISING OUT OF THE

NOVS. WHILE THE NOVS REMAIN PENDING, THE PURCHASER WILL ASSUME THE DEFENSE OF THE MATTER AND WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY RESULTING PENALTIES. THE NOVS ALLEGE THAT PROJECTS UNDERTAKEN DURING 1998 AND 1992 TRIGGERED NEW SOURCE REVIEW PRE-CONSTRUCTION

PERMITTING AND POLLUTION CONTROL REQUIREMENTS.

THE LOUISIANA DEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY (LDEQ) ISSUED AN AIR COMPLIANCE ORDER AND NOTICE OF POTENTIAL PENALTY, RECEIVED ON DECEMBER 5, 2002, WITH RESPECT TO THE CORPORATIONS BATON ROUGE CHEMICAL PLANT. THE LDEQ

INITIATED THIS ENFORCEMENT ACTION IN RESPONSE TO THE FINDING THAT CERTAIN OFFSITE PIPING COMPONENTS WERE NOT CONTAINED IN THE PLANTS FUGITIVE EMISSIONS MONITORING PROGRAM, AS REQUIRED UNDER FEDERAL AND STATE CLEAN AIR LAWS. THE CORPORATION

INITIALLY IDENTIFIED THE ISSUE, MET WITH THE LDEQ, AND COMPLETED A MUTUALLY AGREEABLE COMPLIANCE PLAN PRIOR TO THE INITIATION OF THIS ACTION. NO SPECIFIC DEMAND FOR PENALTIES HAS BEEN MADE.

ALLEGES THAT EMOC FAILED TO CONDUCT TANK TIGHTNESS TESTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE APPLICABLE PETROLEUM BULK STORAGE LAW (UNDER THE ENVIRONMENTAL CONSERVATION LAW OF NEW YORK). THE NYSDEC SEEKS PENALTIES FOR ALL STATIONS IN AN AGGREGATE AMOUNT OF

TABLE OF CONTENTS

FREQUENTLY USED TERMS

LISTED BELOW

ARE DEFINITIONS OF SEVERAL OF EXXONMOBILS FREQUENTLY USED FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE MEASURES. THESE DEFINITIONS ARE PROVIDED TO FACILITATE UNDERSTANDING OF THE TERMS AND THEIR CALCULATION.

EARNINGS EXCLUDING MERGER EXPENSES, DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS AND OTHER

SPECIAL ITEMS

IN ADDITION TO REPORTING U.S. GENERALLY

ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES (GAAP) DEFINED NET INCOME, EXXONMOBIL ALSO PRESENTS A MEASURE OF EARNINGS THAT EXCLUDES MERGER EFFECTS, EARNINGS FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS AND OTHER QUANTIFIED SPECIAL ITEMS. EARNINGS EXCLUDING THE AFOREMENTIONED

ITEMS IS A NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE AND IS INCLUDED TO FACILITATE COMPARISONS OF BASE BUSINESS PERFORMANCE ACROSS PERIODS. A RECONCILIATION OF NET INCOME VERSUS EARNINGS EXCLUDING MERGER EFFECTS, DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS AND OTHER SPECIAL ITEMS IS

PROVIDED IN MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS ON PAGE 28.

EARNINGS PER SHARE AMOUNTS USE THE SAME AVERAGE COMMON SHARES OUTSTANDING AS USED FOR THE CALCULATION OF NET INCOME PER COMMON SHARE AND

NET INCOME PER COMMON SHARE  ASSUMING DILUTION.

OPERATING COSTS

OPERATING COSTS ARE THE

COMBINED TOTAL OF OPERATING, SELLING, GENERAL, ADMINISTRATIVE, EXPLORATION, DEPRECIATION AND DEPLETION EXPENSES FROM THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF INCOME AND EXXONMOBILS SHARE OF SIMILAR COSTS FOR EQUITY COMPANIES. OPERATING COSTS ARE THE

COSTS DURING THE PERIOD TO PRODUCE, MANUFACTURE, AND OTHERWISE PREPARE THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS FOR SALE  INCLUDING ENERGY COSTS, STAFFING, MAINTENANCE, AND OTHER COSTS TO EXPLORE FOR AND PRODUCE OIL AND GAS AND OPERATE REFINING AND

CHEMICAL PLANTS. DISTRIBUTION AND MARKETING EXPENSES ARE ALSO INCLUDED. OPERATING COSTS EXCLUDE THE COST OF RAW MATERIALS AND SEPARATELY REPORTED MERGER-RELATED EXPENSES. THESE EXPENSES ARE ON A BEFORE-TAX BASIS. WHILE EXXONMOBILS MANAGEMENT

IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL REVENUE AND EXPENSE ELEMENTS OF NET INCOME, PARTICULAR FOCUS IS PLACED ON MANAGING THE CONTROLLABLE ASPECTS OF THIS GROUP OF EXPENSES.

CASH FLOW FROM

OPERATIONS AND ASSET SALES

CASH FLOW FROM OPERATIONS AND

ASSET SALES IS THE SUM OF THE NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES AND PROCEEDS FROM SALES OF SUBSIDIARIES, INVESTMENTS AND PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT FROM THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS. THIS CASH FLOW IS THE TOTAL SOURCES OF CASH

FROM BOTH OPERATING THE COMPANYS ASSETS AND THE CASH FROM DIVESTING OF ASSETS. THE CORPORATION EMPLOYS A LONG-STANDING DISCIPLINED REGULAR REVIEW PROCESS TO ENSURE THAT ALL ASSETS ARE CONTRIBUTING TO THE COMPANYS STRATEGIC AND FINANCIAL

OBJECTIVES. ASSETS ARE DIVESTED WHEN THEY ARE NO LONGER MEETING THESE OBJECTIVES OR ARE WORTH CONSIDERABLY MORE TO OTHERS.

CAPITAL EMPLOYED

CAPITAL EMPLOYED IS A MEASURE OF NET INVESTMENT. WHEN VIEWED

FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF HOW THE CAPITAL IS USED BY THE BUSINESSES, IT INCLUDES EXXONMOBILS NET SHARE OF PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT AND OTHER ASSETS LESS LIABILITIES, EXCLUDING BOTH SHORT-TERM AND LONG-TERM DEBT. WHEN VIEWED FROM THE

PERSPECTIVE OF THE SOURCES OF CAPITAL EMPLOYED FOR THE TOTAL CORPORATION, IT INCLUDES EXXONMOBILS SHARE OF TOTAL DEBT AND SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY. BOTH OF THESE VIEWS INCLUDE EXXONMOBILS SHARE OF AMOUNTS APPLICABLE TO EQUITY COMPANIES,

WHICH WE BELIEVE SHOULD BE INCLUDED TO PROVIDE A MORE COMPREHENSIVE MEASURE OF CAPITAL EMPLOYED.

CAPITAL EMPLOYED

RETURN ON AVERAGE CAPITAL EMPLOYED (ROCE)

IS A PERFORMANCE MEASURE RATIO. FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF THE BUSINESS SEGMENTS, ROCE IS ANNUAL BUSINESS SEGMENT EARNINGS DIVIDED BY AVERAGE BUSINESS SEGMENT CAPITAL EMPLOYED (AVERAGE OF BEGINNING AND END OF YEAR AMOUNTS). THESE SEGMENT EARNINGS

INCLUDE EXXONMOBILS SHARE OF SEGMENT EARNINGS OF EQUITY COMPANIES, CONSISTENT WITH OUR CAPITAL EMPLOYED DEFINITION, AND EXCLUDE THE COST OF FINANCING. THE CORPORATIONS TOTAL ROCE IS NET INCOME EXCLUDING THE AFTER-TAX COST OF FINANCING,

DIVIDED BY TOTAL CORPORATE AVERAGE CAPITAL EMPLOYED. THE CORPORATION HAS CONSISTENTLY APPLIED ITS ROCE DEFINITION FOR MANY YEARS AND VIEWS IT AS THE BEST MEASURE OF HISTORICAL CAPITAL PRODUCTIVITY TO BOTH EVALUATE MANAGEMENTS PERFORMANCE AND

TO DEMONSTRATE TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS THAT THEIR CAPITAL HAS BEEN USED WISELY OVER THE LONG TERM. ADDITIONAL MEASURES, WHICH TEND TO BE MORE CASH FLOW BASED, ARE USED FOR FUTURE INVESTMENT DECISIONS.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

OVERVIEW

THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION AND

ANALYSIS OF EXXONMOBILS FINANCIAL RESULTS, AS WELL AS THE ACCOMPANYING FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND RELATED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS TO WHICH THEY REFER, ARE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE MANAGEMENT OF EXXON MOBIL CORPORATION. THE

CORPORATIONS ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL REPORTING FAIRLY REFLECT ITS STRAIGHTFORWARD BUSINESS MODEL INVOLVING THE EXTRACTING, REFINING AND MARKETING OF HYDROCARBONS AND HYDROCARBON-BASED PRODUCTS. THE CORPORATIONS BUSINESS MODEL INVOLVES

THE PRODUCTION (OR PURCHASE), MANUFACTURE AND SALE OF PHYSICAL PRODUCTS, AND ALL COMMERCIAL ACTIVITIES ARE DIRECTLY IN SUPPORT OF THE UNDERLYING PHYSICAL MOVEMENT OF GOODS.

THIS STRAIGHTFORWARD APPROACH EXTENDS TO THE FINANCING OF THE BUSINESS. IN EVALUATING BUSINESS OR INVESTMENT

OPPORTUNITIES, THE CORPORATION VIEWS AS ECONOMICALLY EQUIVALENT ANY DEBT OBLIGATION, WHETHER DISCLOSED ON THE FACE OF THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET, OR DISCLOSED AS OTHER DEBT-LIKE OBLIGATIONS IN NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, SUCH AS THOSE

SUMMARIZED IN THE TABLE ON PAGE 31. THIS CONSISTENT, CONSERVATIVE APPROACH TO FINANCING THE CAPITAL-INTENSIVE NEEDS OF THE CORPORATION HAS HELPED EXXONMOBIL TO SUSTAIN THE TRIPLE-A STATUS OF ITS LONG-TERM DEBT SECURITIES FOR 84 YEARS.

REVIEW OF 2002 RESULTS

NET INCOME WAS

$11,460 MILLION, A DECREASE OF $3,860 MILLION FROM 2001. EARNINGS EXCLUDING MERGER EFFECTS, DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS AND OTHER SPECIAL ITEMS WERE $11,501 MILLION, A DECREASE OF $4,027 MILLION FROM 2001. UPSTREAM (EXPLORATION, PRODUCTION AND POWER)

EARNINGS IN 2002 DECREASED PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER NATURAL GAS REALIZATIONS. UPSTREAM VOLUMES IN 2002, ON AN OIL-EQUIVALENT BASIS, WERE UP 1 PERCENT EXCLUDING THE IMPACT OF OPEC QUOTA RESTRICTIONS. DOWNSTREAM (REFINING AND MARKETING) EARNINGS

DECREASED SUBSTANTIALLY FROM 2001 REFLECTING SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER WORLDWIDE REFINING AND MARKETING MARGINS. CHEMICALS EARNINGS, EXCLUDING THE $175 MILLION OF EXTRAORDINARY GAINS ASSOCIATED WITH ASSET MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES RECORDED IN 2001, WERE $123

MILLION HIGHER REFLECTING INCREASED PRIME PRODUCT SALES ACROSS ALL REGIONS. MERGER IMPLEMENTATION ACTIVITIES IN 2002 REDUCED EARNINGS BY $275 MILLION. EARNINGS OF $449 MILLION ASSOCIATED WITH THE CHILEAN COPPER BUSINESS AND THE COLOMBIAN COAL

OPERATIONS, WHICH WERE SOLD IN 2002, ARE REPORTED AS DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS. THESE EARNINGS INCLUDE A GAIN ON SALE OF $400 MILLION. REVENUE FOR 2002 TOTALED $205 BILLION, DOWN 4 PERCENT FROM 2001.

EXCLUDING MERGER EXPENSES AND DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS, THE

COMBINED TOTAL OF OPERATING COSTS (INCLUDING OPERATING, SELLING, GENERAL, ADMINISTRATIVE, EXPLORATION, DEPRECIATION AND DEPLETION EXPENSES FROM THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF INCOME AND EXXONMOBILS SHARE OF SIMILAR COSTS FOR EQUITY COMPANIES)

IN 2002 WAS $43.2 BILLION, DOWN APPROXIMATELY $300 MILLION FROM 2001. COST INCREASES ASSOCIATED WITH NEW OPERATIONS AND HIGHER PENSION-RELATED EXPENSES WERE MORE THAN OFFSET BY LOWER ENERGY PRICES AND ADDITIONAL EFFICIENCY INITIATIVES CAPTURED IN

ALL BUSINESS LINES. THE IMPACT OF THESE INITIATIVES, INCLUDING THE CAPTURE OF MERGER EFFICIENCIES, REDUCED OPERATING COSTS BY $1.1 BILLION IN 2002, AND CUMULATIVELY BY $5 BILLION SINCE 1998. INTEREST EXPENSE IN 2002 WAS $398 MILLION COMPARED TO $293

MILLION IN 2001 PRIMARILY REFLECTING NON-DEBT ITEMS.

UPSTREAM

UPSTREAM EARNINGS TOTALED $9,598 MILLION INCLUDING A

SPECIAL CHARGE OF $215 MILLION RELATING TO THE IMPACT ON DEFERRED TAXES FROM THE UNITED KINGDOM SUPPLEMENTARY TAX ENACTED IN 2002. ABSENT THIS, UPSTREAM EARNINGS OF $9,813 MILLION DECREASED $923 MILLION PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER NATURAL GAS

REALIZATIONS, PARTICULARLY IN NORTH AMERICA, WHERE PRICES REACHED HISTORICAL HIGHS AT THE BEGINNING OF 2001. HIGHER CRUDE OIL REALIZATIONS PARTLY OFFSET DECLINES IN NATURAL GAS PRICES. OIL-EQUIVALENT PRODUCTION WAS UP 1 PERCENT VERSUS 2001 EXCLUDING

THE IMPACT OF OPEC QUOTA RESTRICTIONS. TOTAL ACTUAL OIL-EQUIVALENT PRODUCTION WAS FLAT AS THE RESUMPTION OF FULL PRODUCTION AT ARUN AND CONTRIBUTIONS FROM NEW PROJECTS AND WORK PROGRAMS OFFSET NATURAL FIELD DECLINES AND OPEC QUOTA RESTRICTIONS.

LIQUIDS PRODUCTION OF 2,496 KBD (THOUSANDS OF BARRELS DAILY) DECREASED 46 KBD FROM 2001. PRODUCTION INCREASES FROM NEW PROJECTS IN ANGOLA, CANADA, MALAYSIA AND VENEZUELA OFFSET NATURAL FIELD DECLINES IN MATURE AREAS. OPEC QUOTA RESTRICTIONS

INCREASED IN 2002. EXCLUDING THE EFFECT OF THESE RESTRICTIONS, LIQUIDS PRODUCTION WAS FLAT WITH 2001. WORLDWIDE NATURAL GAS PRODUCTION OF 10,452 MCFD (MILLIONS OF CUBIC FEET DAILY) IN 2002 COMPARED WITH 10,279 MCFD IN 2001. IMPROVEMENTS IN

ASIA-PACIFIC VOLUMES, MAINLY FROM THE RETURN TO FULL PRODUCTION LEVELS AT THE ARUN FIELD IN INDONESIA FOLLOWING LAST YEARS CURTAILMENTS DUE TO SECURITY CONCERNS, MORE THAN OFFSET LOWER WEATHER-RELATED DEMAND IN EUROPE AND NATURAL FIELD DECLINE

IN THE U.S. WEATHER-RELATED DEMAND IN EUROPE REDUCED TOTAL GAS VOLUMES BY ABOUT 1 PERCENT. EARNINGS FROM U.S. UPSTREAM OPERATIONS FOR 2002 WERE $2,524 MILLION, A DECREASE OF $1,409 MILLION. EXCLUDING THE $215 MILLION SPECIAL CHARGE RELATING TO THE

U.K. TAX RATE CHANGE REPORTED IN 2002, EARNINGS OUTSIDE THE U.S. WERE $7,289 MILLION, $486 MILLION HIGHER THAN LAST YEAR.

DOWNSTREAM

DOWNSTREAM EARNINGS OF $1,300 MILLION DECREASED BY $2,927 MILLION FROM A RECORD 2001, REFLECTING SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER REFINING MARGINS IN MOST GEOGRAPHICAL

AREAS, AND FURTHER WEAKNESS IN MARKETING MARGINS. IMPROVED REFINING OPERATIONS AND LOWER OPERATING EXPENSES PROVIDED A PARTIAL OFFSET TO THE MARGIN DECLINE. EARNINGS ALSO BENEFITED FROM A PLANNED REDUCTION IN INVENTORIES AS A RESULT OF OPTIMIZING

OPERATIONS AROUND THE WORLD. PETROLEUM PRODUCT SALES OF 7,757 KBD DECREASED 214 KBD FROM 2001, LARGELY RELATED TO REDUCED REFINERY RUNS DUE TO WEAK MARGINS AND LOWER DEMAND FOR DISTILLATES AND AVIATION FUELS. REFINERY THROUGHPUT WAS 5,481 KBD

COMPARED WITH 5,571 KBD IN 2001. U.S. DOWNSTREAM EARNINGS WERE $693 MILLION, DOWN $1,231 MILLION DUE TO WEAKER REFINING MARGINS. EARNINGS OUTSIDE THE U.S. OF $607 MILLION WERE $1,696 MILLION LOWER THAN 2001 DUE TO LOWER REFINING AND MARKETING

MARGINS.

CHEMICALS

EXCLUDING EXTRAORDINARY GAINS OF $175 MILLION RECORDED IN 2001, CHEMICALS

EARNINGS OF $830 MILLION FOR 2002 WERE $123 MILLION HIGHER THAN 2001. EARNINGS BENEFITED FROM RECORD PRIME PRODUCT SALES VOLUMES OF 26,925 KT (THOUSANDS OF METRIC TONS) WHICH WERE 4 PERCENT ABOVE 2001 REFLECTING CAPACITY ADDITIONS IN SINGAPORE AND

SAUDI ARABIA. WORLDWIDE CHEMICALS MARGINS REMAINED WEAK DURING 2002.

CORPORATE AND FINANCING

CORPORATE AND

FINANCING EXPENSES INCREASED $300 MILLION TO $442 MILLION, REFLECTING HIGHER PENSION EXPENSE AND LOWER INTEREST INCOME.

DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS

EARNINGS FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS TOTALED $449 MILLION, AN INCREASE OF $347 MILLION, PRIMARILY REFLECTING THE GAIN ON THE SALE OF ASSETS DURING THE

PERIOD.

DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

REVIEW OF 2001 RESULTS

NET INCOME IN

2001 WAS $15,320 MILLION, INCLUDING $215 MILLION OF EXTRAORDINARY GAINS, $525 MILLION OF MERGER COSTS AND $102 MILLION OF EARNINGS FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS. NET INCOME IN 2001 DECREASED $2,400 MILLION FROM 2000, WHICH BENEFITED FROM $810 MILLION

IN NET FAVORABLE MERGER EFFECTS INCLUDING GAINS FROM DIVESTMENTS REQUIRED AS A CONDITION OF REGULATORY APPROVAL OF THE MERGER AND $184 MILLION FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS. EARNINGS EXCLUDING MERGER EFFECTS, DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS AND OTHER SPECIAL

ITEMS WERE $15,528 MILLION, A DECREASE OF $1,198 MILLION FROM 2000. UPSTREAM (EXPLORATION, PRODUCTION AND POWER) EARNINGS IN 2001 DECLINED, FOLLOWING LOWER CRUDE OIL REALIZATIONS, WHICH ON AVERAGE WERE DOWN 18 PERCENT VERSUS 2000. UPSTREAM VOLUMES

IN 2001, ON AN OIL-EQUIVALENT BASIS, WERE UP 1 PERCENT EXCLUDING THE EFFECT OF REDUCED NATURAL GAS PRODUCTION OPERATIONS IN INDONESIA DUE TO SECURITY CONCERNS. DOWNSTREAM (REFINING AND MARKETING) EARNINGS IMPROVED FROM 2000, REFLECTING STRONGER U.S.

REFINING MARGINS AND IMPROVED MARKETING RESULTS OUTSIDE OF THE U.S. CHEMICALS EARNINGS DECLINED VERSUS 2000, AS LOWER PRODUCT REALIZATIONS AND WEAKENING DEMAND CONDITIONS PUT SIGNIFICANT PRESSURE ON COMMODITY MARGINS AND MORE THAN OFFSET THE $175

MILLION OF EXTRAORDINARY GAINS ASSOCIATED WITH ASSET MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES. PRIME PRODUCT SALES VOLUMES WERE 1 PERCENT HIGHER THAN 2000, REFLECTING CAPACITY ADDITIONS IN SINGAPORE AND SAUDI ARABIA. MERGER IMPLEMENTATION ACTIVITIES IN 2001 REDUCED

EARNINGS BY A NET $485 MILLION. GAINS FROM ASSET DIVESTITURES THAT WERE A CONDITION OF REGULATORY APPROVAL OF THE MERGER ADDED $40 MILLION TO EARNINGS, PARTLY OFFSETTING MERGER IMPLEMENTATION EXPENSES OF $525 MILLION. REVENUE FOR 2001 TOTALED $213

BILLION, DOWN 8 PERCENT FROM 2000.

EXCLUDING

MERGER EXPENSES AND DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS, THE COMBINED TOTAL OF OPERATING COSTS (INCLUDING OPERATING, SELLING, GENERAL, ADMINISTRATIVE, EXPLORATION, DEPRECIATION AND DEPLETION EXPENSES FROM THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF INCOME AND

EXXONMOBILS SHARE OF SIMILAR COSTS FOR EQUITY COMPANIES) IN 2001 WAS $43.5 BILLION, UP $600 MILLION FROM 2000. COST INCREASES ASSOCIATED WITH NEW OPERATIONS, HIGHER ENERGY COSTS AND HIGHER PENSION-RELATED EXPENSES WERE SUBSTANTIALLY OFFSET BY

THE FAVORABLE IMPACT OF CONTINUING EFFICIENCY INITIATIVES CARRIED OUT IN ALL BUSINESS LINES. THE IMPACT OF THESE INITIATIVES, INCLUDING THE CAPTURE OF MERGER EFFICIENCIES, REDUCED OPERATING COSTS BY $1.2 BILLION IN 2001, AND CUMULATIVELY BY $4

BILLION SINCE 1998. INTEREST EXPENSE IN 2001 WAS $293 MILLION COMPARED TO $589 MILLION IN 2000 REFLECTING LOWER DEBT LEVELS AND INTEREST RATES.

UPSTREAM

UPSTREAM EARNINGS OF $10,736 MILLION DECREASED $1,949 MILLION, OR 15 PERCENT FROM 2000S RECORD LEVEL, PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER CRUDE OIL PRICES. THE IMPACTS OF LOWER CRUDE REALIZATIONS AND HIGHER

EXPLORATION EXPENSES IN FUTURE GROWTH AREAS WERE PARTLY OFFSET BY HIGHER AVERAGE NATURAL GAS REALIZATIONS, PRINCIPALLY IN NORTH AMERICA AND EUROPE. U.S. AND CANADIAN NATURAL GAS PRICES REACHED HISTORICAL HIGHS EARLY IN 2001 BUT DROPPED THROUGH THE

REMAINDER OF THE YEAR. LIQUIDS PRODUCTION IN 2001 OF 2,542 KBD WAS DOWN SLIGHTLY FROM 2000, AS NATURAL FIELD DECLINES IN MATURE AREAS WERE LARGELY OFFSET BY NEW VOLUMES FROM WORK PROGRAMS AND NEW DEVELOPMENTS IN THE NORTH SEA, U.S., EQUATORIAL

GUINEA AND KAZAKHSTAN, SOME OF WHICH HAVE NOT YET REACHED FULL CAPACITY. ABSENT THE EFFECT OF REDUCED ARUN OPERATIONS IN INDONESIA DUE TO SECURITY CONCERNS, WORLDWIDE GAS PRODUCTION WAS UP ABOUT 2 PERCENT, WITH INCREASES IN EUROPE, AUSTRALIA, CANADA

AND QATAR. INCLUDING THE IMPACT OF LOWER INDONESIA VOLUMES, FULL-YEAR 2001 WORLDWIDE NATURAL GAS PRODUCTION OF 10,279 MCFD COMPARED WITH 10,343 MCFD IN 2000. COMBINED LIQUIDS AND GAS VOLUMES, ON AN OIL-EQUIVALENT BASIS, WERE UP 1 PERCENT EXCLUDING

THE EFFECT OF REDUCED NATURAL GAS PRODUCTION OPERATIONS IN INDONESIA. EARNINGS FROM U.S. UPSTREAM OPERATIONS WERE $3,933 MILLION, A DECREASE OF $609 MILLION. EARNINGS OUTSIDE THE U.S. WERE $6,803 MILLION, $1,340 MILLION LOWER THAN 2000.

DOWNSTREAM

DOWNSTREAM EARNINGS OF $4,227 MILLION WERE A RECORD AND IMPROVED 24 PERCENT

OVER 2000. RESULTS BENEFITED FROM HIGHER REFINING MARGINS EARLY IN THE YEAR, PARTICULARLY IN THE U.S., IMPROVED WORLDWIDE REFINING OPERATIONS AND HIGHER MARKETING MARGINS OUTSIDE THE U.S. REFINING MARGINS IN MOST AREAS PEAKED IN THE SECOND QUARTER

AND DECLINED DURING THE SECOND HALF OF 2001. EARNINGS ALSO BENEFITED FROM A PLANNED REDUCTION IN INVENTORIES AS A RESULT OF OPTIMIZING OPERATIONS AROUND THE WORLD. PETROLEUM PRODUCT SALES OF 7,971 KBD COMPARED WITH 7,993 KBD IN THE PRIOR YEAR.

EXCLUDING THE EFFECT OF THE REQUIRED MERGER-RELATED DIVESTMENTS IN 2000, VOLUMES WERE UP SLIGHTLY. REFINERY THROUGHPUT WAS 5,571 KBD COMPARED WITH 5,642 KBD IN 2000. U.S. DOWNSTREAM EARNINGS WERE $1,924 MILLION, UP $363 MILLION, REFLECTING STRONGER

REFINING MARGINS AND IMPROVED OPERATIONS. EARNINGS OUTSIDE THE U.S. OF $2,303 MILLION WERE $446 MILLION HIGHER THAN 2000. THE IMPROVEMENT WAS DRIVEN BY STRONGER MARKETING MARGINS, PARTLY OFFSET BY WEAKER EUROPEAN REFINING MARGINS.

CHEMICALS

CHEMICALS EARNINGS TOTALED $882 MILLION, INCLUDING $175 MILLION OF NET GAINS ON ASSET MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES. ABSENT THIS

SPECIAL ITEM, CHEMICALS EARNINGS WERE $707 MILLION, A DECREASE OF $454 MILLION FROM 2000. MOST OF THE REDUCTION OCCURRED IN THE U.S. AS LOWER PRODUCT REALIZATIONS AND WEAKENING DEMAND CONDITIONS PUT SIGNIFICANT PRESSURE ON COMMODITY MARGINS. PRIME

PRODUCT SALES VOLUMES OF 25,780 KT WERE 1 PERCENT ABOVE THE PRIOR YEARS RECORD LEVEL AS HIGHER SALES OUTSIDE THE U.S., REFLECTING CAPACITY ADDITIONS IN SINGAPORE AND SAUDI ARABIA, WERE PARTLY OFFSET BY LOWER SALES IN THE U.S. REFLECTING WEAKER

INDUSTRIAL DEMAND.

CORPORATE AND FINANCING

CORPORATE AND FINANCING EXPENSES DECREASED $396 MILLION TO $142 MILLION,

REFLECTING LOWER NET INTEREST COSTS DUE TO LOWER DEBT LEVELS AND HIGHER CASH BALANCES, ALONG WITH FAVORABLE FOREIGN EXCHANGE AND TAX EFFECTS.

DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS

EARNINGS FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS TOTALED $102 MILLION, A DECREASE OF $82 MILLION FROM 2000, REFLECTING LOWER COPPER PRICES.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

2002

CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING

ACTIVITIES TOTALED $21.3 BILLION, DOWN $1.6 BILLION FROM 2001. MAJOR SOURCES OF FUNDS WERE NET INCOME OF $11.5 BILLION AND NON-CASH PROVISIONS OF $8.3 BILLION FOR DEPRECIATION AND DEPLETION. THE ALL OTHER ITEMS  NET LINE IN CASH

FLOW FROM OPERATIONS INCLUDED $1.5 BILLION IN FUNDS RECEIVED FROM BEB ERDGAS UND ERDOEL GMBH (BEB), A GERMAN EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION COMPANY INDIRECTLY OWNED 50 PERCENT AND ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER THE EQUITY METHOD OF ACCOUNTING. THE

FUNDS WERE LOANED IN CONNECTION WITH A RESTRUCTURING THAT WILL ENABLE BEB TO TRANSFER ITS HOLDINGS IN RUHRGAS

30

TABLE OF CONTENTS

AG, A GERMAN GAS TRANSMISSION

COMPANY. IT IS ANTICIPATED THAT NET INCOME WILL BE RECOGNIZED IN 2003 UPON FINALIZATION OF REGULATORY REVIEWS AND COMPLETION OF THE TRANSFER OF THE RUHRGAS SHARES.

CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES TOTALED $9.8 BILLION, $1.6 BILLION HIGHER THAN 2001 AND INCLUDED INCREASED

SPENDING FOR PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT AND OTHER INVESTMENTS AND ADVANCES. PROCEEDS FROM THE SALES OF SUBSIDIARIES, INVESTMENTS AND PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT WERE $2.8 BILLION, INCLUDING THE DIVESTMENT OF COLOMBIAN COAL OPERATIONS AND THE

COMPANYS COPPER BUSINESS IN CHILE IN 2002.

CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES WAS $11.4 BILLION, DOWN $3.7 BILLION REFLECTING LOWER DEBT REDUCTIONS. DIVIDEND PAYMENTS ON COMMON SHARES INCREASED TO $0.92 PER SHARE FROM $0.91 PER SHARE AND TOTALED $6.2 BILLION, A PAYOUT OF 54

PERCENT. TOTAL CONSOLIDATED SHORT-TERM AND LONG-TERM DEBT WAS COMPARABLE AT $10.7 BILLION. SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY INCREASED BY $1.4 BILLION TO $74.6 BILLION.

DURING 2002, EXXON MOBIL CORPORATION PURCHASED 127 MILLION SHARES OF ITS COMMON STOCK FOR THE TREASURY AT A

GROSS COST OF $4.8 BILLION. THESE PURCHASES WERE TO OFFSET SHARES ISSUED IN CONJUNCTION WITH COMPANY BENEFIT PLANS AND PROGRAMS AND TO REDUCE THE NUMBER OF SHARES OUTSTANDING. SHARES OUTSTANDING WERE REDUCED FROM 6,809 MILLION AT THE END OF 2001 TO

6,700 MILLION AT THE END OF 2002. PURCHASES WERE MADE IN BOTH THE OPEN MARKET AND THROUGH NEGOTIATED TRANSACTIONS, AND MAY BE DISCONTINUED AT ANY TIME.

ALTHOUGH THE CORPORATION ISSUES LONG-TERM DEBT FROM TIME TO TIME AND MAINTAINS A REVOLVING COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAM, INTERNALLY GENERATED

FUNDS COVER THE MAJORITY OF ITS FINANCIAL REQUIREMENTS. THE MANAGEMENT OF CASH THAT MAY BE TEMPORARILY AVAILABLE AS SURPLUS TO THE CORPORATIONS IMMEDIATE NEEDS IS CAREFULLY CONTROLLED, BOTH TO OPTIMIZE RETURNS ON CASH BALANCES, AND TO ENSURE

ITS SECURE, READY AVAILABILITY TO MEET THE CORPORATIONS CASH REQUIREMENTS AS THEY ARISE.

2001

CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES TOTALED $22.9 BILLION, THE SAME LEVEL AS 2000. MAJOR SOURCES OF FUNDS WERE NET INCOME OF $15.3 BILLION AND NON-CASH PROVISIONS OF $7.8 BILLION FOR DEPRECIATION AND DEPLETION.

CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES TOTALED $8.2 BILLION, UP

$4.9 BILLION FROM 2000 DUE TO LOWER PROCEEDS FROM SALES OF SUBSIDIARIES, INVESTMENTS AND PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT RESULTING FROM THE ABSENCE OF THE ASSET DIVESTITURES IN 2000 THAT WERE REQUIRED AS A CONDITION OF THE REGULATORY APPROVAL OF THE

MERGER, AND DUE TO HIGHER ADDITIONS TO PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT.

CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES WAS $15.0 BILLION, UP $0.9 BILLION, DRIVEN BY HIGHER PURCHASES OF COMMON SHARES, OFFSET BY LOWER DEBT REDUCTIONS. DIVIDEND PAYMENTS ON COMMON SHARES INCREASED FROM $0.88 PER SHARE TO $0.91

PER SHARE AND TOTALED $6.3 BILLION, A PAYOUT OF 41 PERCENT. TOTAL CONSOLIDATED SHORT-TERM AND LONG-TERM DEBT DECLINED BY $2.6 BILLION TO $10.8 BILLION. SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY INCREASED BY $2.4 BILLION TO $73.2 BILLION.

DURING 2001, EXXON MOBIL CORPORATION PURCHASED 139 MILLION

SHARES OF ITS COMMON STOCK FOR THE TREASURY AT A GROSS COST OF $5.7 BILLION. THESE PURCHASES WERE TO OFFSET SHARES ISSUED IN CONJUNCTION WITH COMPANY BENEFIT PLANS AND PROGRAMS AND TO REDUCE THE NUMBER OF SHARES OUTSTANDING. SHARES OUTSTANDING WERE

REDUCED FROM 6,930 MILLION AT THE END OF 2000 TO 6,809 MILLION AT THE END OF 2001. PURCHASES WERE MADE IN BOTH THE OPEN MARKET AND THROUGH NEGOTIATED TRANSACTIONS, AND MAY BE DISCONTINUED AT ANY TIME.

LONG-TERM CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND OTHER COMMERCIAL COMMITMENTS

SET FORTH BELOW IS INFORMATION ABOUT THE CORPORATIONS

LONG-TERM CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND OTHER COMMERCIAL COMMITMENTS OUTSTANDING AT DECEMBER 31, 2002. IT BRINGS TOGETHER DATA FOR EASY REFERENCE FROM THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET AND FROM INDIVIDUAL NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. THIS

INFORMATION IS IMPORTANT IN UNDERSTANDING THE FINANCIAL POSITION OF THE CORPORATION. IN CONSIDERING THE ECONOMIC VIABILITY OF INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES, THE CORPORATION VIEWS ANY SOURCE OF FINANCING, WHETHER IT BE OPERATING LEASES, THIRD-PARTY

GUARANTEES OR EQUITY COMPANY DEBT, AS BEING ECONOMICALLY EQUIVALENT TO CONSOLIDATED DEBT OF THE CORPORATION.

OTHER COMMERCIAL COMMITMENTS

THE

CORPORATION AND CERTAIN OF ITS CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES WERE CONTINGENTLY LIABLE AT DECEMBER 31, 2002, FOR $3,038 MILLION, PRIMARILY RELATING TO GUARANTEES FOR NOTES, LOANS AND PERFORMANCE UNDER CONTRACTS (NOTE 17). THIS INCLUDED $986 MILLION

REPRESENTING GUARANTEES OF NON-U.S. EXCISE TAXES AND CUSTOMS DUTIES OF OTHER COMPANIES, ENTERED INTO AS A NORMAL BUSINESS PRACTICE, UNDER RECIPROCAL ARRANGEMENTS. ALSO INCLUDED IN THIS AMOUNT WERE GUARANTEES BY CONSOLIDATED AFFILIATES OF $1,621

MILLION, REPRESENTING EXXONMOBILS SHARE OF OBLIGATIONS OF CERTAIN EQUITY COMPANIES. THE ABOVE-MENTIONED GUARANTEES ARE NOT REASONABLY LIKELY TO HAVE A MATERIAL CURRENT OR FUTURE EFFECT ON THE CORPORATIONS FINANCIAL CONDITION, CHANGES IN

FINANCIAL CONDITION, REVENUES OR EXPENSES, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, LIQUIDITY, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES OR CAPITAL RESOURCES.

ON DECEMBER 31, 2002, UNUSED CREDIT LINES FOR SHORT-TERM FINANCING TOTALED APPROXIMATELY $4.2 BILLION (NOTE 7).

THE TABLE BELOW SHOWS THE CORPORATIONS FIXED CHARGE

COVERAGE AND CONSOLIDATED DEBT TO CAPITAL RATIOS. THE DATA DEMONSTRATE THE CORPORATIONS CREDITWORTHINESS. THROUGHOUT THIS PERIOD, THE CORPORATIONS LONG-TERM DEBT SECURITIES MAINTAINED THE TOP CREDIT RATING FROM BOTH STANDARD AND

MANAGEMENT VIEWS THE CORPORATIONS

FINANCIAL STRENGTH, AS EVIDENCED BY THE ABOVE FINANCIAL RATIOS AND OTHER SIMILAR MEASURES, TO BE A COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE OF STRATEGIC IMPORTANCE. THE CORPORATIONS SOUND FINANCIAL POSITION GIVES IT THE OPPORTUNITY TO ACCESS THE WORLDS

CAPITAL MARKETS IN THE FULL RANGE OF MARKET CONDITIONS, AND ENABLES THE CORPORATION TO TAKE ON LARGE, LONG-TERM CAPITAL COMMITMENTS IN THE PURSUIT OF MAXIMIZING SHAREHOLDER VALUE.

IN ADDITION TO THE ABOVE COMMITMENTS, THE CORPORATION MAKES LIMITED USE OF DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS, WHICH ARE

DISCUSSED IN RISK MANAGEMENT ON PAGE 34 AND NOTE 14 ON PAGE 49.

LITIGATION AND OTHER CONTINGENCIES

AS

DISCUSSED IN NOTE 17 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, A NUMBER OF LAWSUITS, INCLUDING CLASS ACTIONS, WERE BROUGHT IN VARIOUS COURTS AGAINST EXXON MOBIL CORPORATION AND CERTAIN OF ITS SUBSIDIARIES RELATING TO THE ACCIDENTAL RELEASE OF CRUDE

OIL FROM THE TANKER EXXON VALDEZ IN 1989. THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE CLAIMS HAVE BEEN RESOLVED LEAVING A FEW COMPENSATORY DAMAGES CASES TO BE RESOLVED. ALL OF THE PUNITIVE DAMAGE CLAIMS WERE CONSOLIDATED IN THE CIVIL TRIAL THAT BEGAN IN MAY 1994.

IN THAT TRIAL, ON SEPTEMBER 24, 1996, THE UNITED

STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF ALASKA ENTERED A JUDGMENT IN THE AMOUNT OF $5 BILLION IN PUNITIVE DAMAGES TO A CLASS COMPOSED OF ALL PERSONS AND ENTITIES WHO ASSERTED CLAIMS FOR PUNITIVE DAMAGES FROM THE CORPORATION AS A RESULT OF THE

EXXON VALDEZ GROUNDING. EXXONMOBIL APPEALED THE JUDGMENT. ON NOVEMBER 7, 2001, THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT VACATED THE PUNITIVE DAMAGE AWARD AS BEING EXCESSIVE UNDER THE CONSTITUTION AND REMANDED THE CASE TO THE DISTRICT

COURT FOR IT TO DETERMINE THE AMOUNT OF THE PUNITIVE DAMAGE AWARD CONSISTENT WITH THE NINTH CIRCUITS HOLDING. ON DECEMBER 6, 2002, THE DISTRICT COURT REDUCED THE PUNITIVE DAMAGES AWARD FROM $5 BILLION TO $4 BILLION. THIS CASE WILL RETURN TO

THE NINTH CIRCUIT FOR ITS DETERMINATION. THE CORPORATION HAS POSTED A $4.8 BILLION LETTER OF CREDIT. THE ULTIMATE COST TO THE CORPORATION FROM THE LAWSUITS ARISING FROM THE EXXON VALDEZ GROUNDING IS NOT POSSIBLE TO PREDICT AND MAY NOT BE RESOLVED

FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS.

ON DECEMBER 19, 2000, A

JURY IN MONTGOMERY COUNTY, ALABAMA, RETURNED A VERDICT AGAINST THE CORPORATION IN A CONTRACT DISPUTE OVER ROYALTIES IN THE AMOUNT OF $87.69 MILLION IN COMPENSATORY DAMAGES AND $3.42 BILLION IN PUNITIVE DAMAGES IN THE CASE OF EXXON CORPORATION V.

STATE OF ALABAMA, ET AL. THE VERDICT WAS UPHELD BY THE TRIAL COURT ON MAY 4, 2001. ON DECEMBER 20, 2002, THE ALABAMA SUPREME COURT VACATED THE $3.5 BILLION JURY VERDICT. THE DECISION SENDS THE CASE BACK TO A LOWER COURT FOR A NEW TRIAL. THE ULTIMATE

OUTCOME IS NOT EXPECTED TO HAVE A MATERIALLY ADVERSE EFFECT UPON THE CORPORATIONS OPERATIONS OR FINANCIAL CONDITION.

ON MAY 22, 2001, A STATE COURT JURY IN NEW ORLEANS, LOUISIANA, RETURNED A VERDICT AGAINST THE CORPORATION AND THREE OTHER ENTITIES IN A

CASE BROUGHT BY A LANDOWNER CLAIMING DAMAGE TO HIS PROPERTY. THE PROPERTY HAD BEEN LEASED BY THE LANDOWNER TO A COMPANY THAT PERFORMED PIPE CLEANING AND STORAGE SERVICES FOR CUSTOMERS, INCLUDING THE CORPORATION. THE JURY AWARDED THE PLAINTIFF $56

MILLION IN COMPENSATORY DAMAGES (90 PERCENT TO BE PAID BY THE CORPORATION) AND $1 BILLION IN PUNITIVE DAMAGES (ALL TO BE PAID BY THE CORPORATION). THE DAMAGE RELATED TO THE PRESENCE OF NATURALLY OCCURRING RADIOACTIVE MATERIAL (NORM) ON THE SITE

RESULTING FROM PIPE CLEANING OPERATIONS. THE AWARD HAS BEEN UPHELD AT THE TRIAL COURT. EXXONMOBIL HAS APPEALED THE JUDGMENT TO THE LOUISIANA FOURTH CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS AND BELIEVES THAT THE JUDGMENT SHOULD BE SET ASIDE OR SUBSTANTIALLY REDUCED

ON FACTUAL AND CONSTITUTIONAL GROUNDS. THE ULTIMATE OUTCOME IS NOT EXPECTED TO HAVE A MATERIALLY ADVERSE EFFECT UPON THE CORPORATIONS OPERATIONS OR FINANCIAL CONDITION.

THE U.S. TAX COURT HAS DECIDED THE ISSUE WITH RESPECT TO THE PRICING OF CRUDE OIL PURCHASED FROM SAUDI ARABIA

FOR THE YEARS 1979-1981 IN FAVOR OF THE CORPORATION. THIS DECISION IS SUBJECT TO APPEAL. CERTAIN OTHER ISSUES FOR THE YEARS 1979-1993 REMAIN PENDING BEFORE THE TAX COURT. THE ULTIMATE RESOLUTION OF THESE ISSUES AND SEVERAL OTHER TAX AND LEGAL

ISSUES, INCLUDING RESOLUTION OF TAX ISSUES RELATED TO THE GAS LIFTING IMBALANCE ALONG THE GERMAN/DUTCH BORDER, IS NOT EXPECTED TO HAVE A MATERIALLY ADVERSE EFFECT UPON THE CORPORATIONS OPERATIONS OR FINANCIAL CONDITION.

THERE ARE NO EVENTS OR UNCERTAINTIES KNOWN TO MANAGEMENT

BEYOND THOSE ALREADY INCLUDED IN REPORTED FINANCIAL INFORMATION THAT WOULD INDICATE A MATERIAL CHANGE IN FUTURE OPERATING RESULTS OR FINANCIAL CONDITION.

CAPITAL AND EXPLORATION EXPENDITURES

CAPITAL AND EXPLORATION EXPENDITURES IN 2002 WERE $14.0 BILLION, UP FROM $12.3 BILLION IN 2001, REFLECTING THE CORPORATIONS ACTIVE INVESTMENT PROGRAM.

UPSTREAM SPENDING WAS UP 18 PERCENT TO $10.4 BILLION IN 2002, FROM $8.8 BILLION IN 2001, AS A RESULT OF

HIGHER SPENDING ON MAJOR PROJECTS IN AFRICA, CANADA AND AZERBAIJAN, AND INCREASED DRILLING ACTIVITY. CAPITAL INVESTMENTS IN THE DOWNSTREAM TOTALED $2.4 BILLION IN 2002, UP $0.1 BILLION FROM 2001, PRIMARILY REFLECTING INCREASED INVESTMENTS REQUIRED

FOR

LOW-SULFUR MOTOR FUELS

PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER SPENDING ON BASE ACTIVITIES. CHEMICALS CAPITAL EXPENDITURES WERE $1.0 BILLION IN 2002, UP FROM $0.9 BILLION IN 2001, DUE TO THE ACQUISITION OF OUR JOINT VENTURE PARTNERS INTEREST IN ADVANCED ELASTOMERS SYSTEMS.

CAPITAL AND EXPLORATION EXPENDITURES IN THE U.S.

TOTALED $4.0 BILLION IN 2002, AN INCREASE OF $0.1 BILLION FROM 2001, REFLECTING HIGHER SPENDING IN CHEMICALS, PARTLY OFFSET BY LOWER SPENDING IN THE UPSTREAM. SPENDING OUTSIDE THE U.S. OF $10.0 BILLION IN 2002 WAS UP $1.6 BILLION FROM 2001,

REFLECTING HIGHER EXPENDITURES IN THE UPSTREAM AND DOWNSTREAM, PARTLY OFFSET BY LOWER EXPENDITURES IN CHEMICALS.

MERGER OF EXXON CORPORATION AND MOBIL CORPORATION

ON NOVEMBER 30, 1999, A WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARY OF EXXON CORPORATION (EXXON) MERGED WITH MOBIL CORPORATION (MOBIL) SO THAT MOBIL BECAME A WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARY OF EXXON (THE MERGER). AT THE SAME TIME, EXXON CHANGED ITS

NAME TO EXXON MOBIL CORPORATION (EXXONMOBIL).

AS

A CONDITION OF THE APPROVAL OF THE MERGER, THE U.S. FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION AND THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION REQUIRED THAT CERTAIN PROPERTY  PRIMARILY DOWNSTREAM, PIPELINE AND NATURAL GAS DISTRIBUTION ASSETS  BE DIVESTED. THE CARRYING VALUE

OF THESE ASSETS WAS APPROXIMATELY $3 BILLION AND BEFORE-TAX PROCEEDS WERE APPROXIMATELY $5 BILLION. NET AFTER-TAX GAINS OF $40 MILLION AND $1,730 MILLION WERE REPORTED IN 2001 AND 2000, RESPECTIVELY, AS EXTRAORDINARY ITEMS CONSISTENT WITH POOLING OF

INTERESTS ACCOUNTING REQUIREMENTS. THE DIVESTED PROPERTIES HISTORICALLY EARNED APPROXIMATELY $200 MILLION PER YEAR. THE MERGER WAS ACCOUNTED FOR AS A POOLING OF INTERESTS.

MERGER EXPENSES AND REORGANIZATION RESERVES

IN ASSOCIATION WITH THE MERGER BETWEEN EXXON AND MOBIL, $410 MILLION PRE-TAX ($275 MILLION AFTER-TAX), $748 MILLION PRE-TAX ($525 MILLION AFTER-TAX) AND $1,406 MILLION PRE-TAX ($920 MILLION AFTER-TAX) OF COSTS WERE RECORDED AS

MERGER-RELATED EXPENSES IN 2002, 2001 AND 2000, RESPECTIVELY. CHARGES INCLUDED SEPARATION EXPENSES RELATED TO WORKFORCE REDUCTIONS (APPROXIMATELY 8,200 EMPLOYEES AT YEAR-END 2002), PLUS IMPLEMENTATION AND MERGER CLOSING COSTS. THE SEPARATION RESERVE

BALANCE AT YEAR-END 2002 OF APPROXIMATELY $101 MILLION IS EXPECTED TO BE EXPENDED IN 2003. MERGER-RELATED EXPENSES FOR THE PERIOD 1999 TO 2002 CUMULATIVELY TOTAL APPROXIMATELY $3.2 BILLION PRE-TAX. PRE-TAX OPERATING SYNERGIES ASSOCIATED WITH THE

MERGER, INCLUDING COST SAVINGS, EFFICIENCY GAINS, AND REVENUE ENHANCEMENTS, HAVE CUMULATIVELY REACHED OVER $7 BILLION BY 2002. REFLECTING THE COMPLETION OF MERGER-RELATED ACTIVITIES, MERGER EXPENSES WILL NOT BE REPORTED IN 2003.

SITE RESTORATION AND OTHER ENVIRONMENTAL COSTS

OVER THE YEARS THE CORPORATION HAS ACCRUED PROVISIONS FOR ESTIMATED SITE RESTORATION COSTS TO BE INCURRED AT THE END OF THE OPERATING LIFE OF CERTAIN OF ITS FACILITIES AND PROPERTIES. IN ADDITION, THE CORPORATION ACCRUES PROVISIONS

FOR ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES IN THE MANY COUNTRIES IN WHICH IT DOES BUSINESS WHEN IT IS PROBABLE THAT OBLIGATIONS HAVE BEEN INCURRED AND THE AMOUNTS CAN BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED. THIS POLICY APPLIES TO ASSETS OR BUSINESSES CURRENTLY OWNED OR

PREVIOUSLY DISPOSED.

THE CORPORATION HAS ACCRUED

PROVISIONS FOR PROBABLE ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION OBLIGATIONS AT VARIOUS SITES, INCLUDING MULTI-PARTY SITES WHERE EXXONMOBIL HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED AS ONE OF THE POTENTIALLY RESPONSIBLE PARTIES BY THE U.S. ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY. THE

INVOLVEMENT OF OTHER FINANCIALLY RESPONSIBLE COMPANIES AT THESE MULTI-PARTY SITES MITIGATES EXXONMOBILS ACTUAL JOINT AND SEVERAL LIABILITY EXPOSURE. AT PRESENT, NO INDIVIDUAL SITE IS EXPECTED TO HAVE LOSSES MATERIAL TO EXXONMOBILS

OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL CONDITION OR LIQUIDITY.

CHARGES MADE AGAINST INCOME FOR SITE RESTORATION AND ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES WERE $400 MILLION IN 2002, $371 MILLION IN 2001 AND $311 MILLION IN 2000. AT THE END OF 2002, ACCUMULATED SITE RESTORATION AND ENVIRONMENTAL PROVISIONS,

AFTER REDUCTION FOR AMOUNTS PAID, AMOUNTED TO $3.9 BILLION. EXXONMOBIL BELIEVES THAT ANY COST IN EXCESS OF THE AMOUNTS ALREADY PROVIDED FOR IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS WOULD NOT HAVE A MATERIALLY ADVERSE EFFECT UPON THE CORPORATIONS

OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL CONDITION OR LIQUIDITY. THE METHODOLOGY FOR ACCOUNTING FOR SITE RESTORATION RESERVES WILL BE MODIFIED AS OF JANUARY 1, 2003 (SEE PAGES 34-35).

EXXONMOBILS WORLDWIDE ENVIRONMENTAL COSTS IN 2002 TOTALED $2,343 MILLION OF WHICH $1,054 MILLION WERE

CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND $1,289 MILLION WERE OPERATING COSTS (INCLUDING THE $400 MILLION OF SITE RESTORATION AND ENVIRONMENTAL PROVISIONS NOTED ABOVE). THESE COSTS WERE MOSTLY ASSOCIATED WITH AIR AND WATER CONSERVATION. TOTAL COSTS FOR SUCH

ACTIVITIES ARE EXPECTED TO INCREASE TO ABOUT $2.5 BILLION IN BOTH 2003 AND 2004 (WITH CAPITAL EXPENDITURES REPRESENTING ABOUT 50 PERCENT OF THE TOTAL). THE PROJECTED INCREASE IS PRIMARILY FOR CAPITAL PROJECTS TO IMPLEMENT REFINING TECHNOLOGY TO

MANUFACTURE LOW-SULFUR MOTOR FUELS IN MANY PARTS OF THE WORLD.

TAXES

2002

INCOME, EXCISE AND ALL OTHER TAXES AND DUTIES TOTALED $64.3 BILLION IN 2002,

A DECREASE OF $2.2 BILLION OR 3 PERCENT FROM 2001. INCOME TAX EXPENSE, BOTH CURRENT AND DEFERRED, WAS $6.5 BILLION COMPARED TO $9.0 BILLION IN 2001, REFLECTING LOWER PRE-TAX INCOME IN 2002. THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE OF 39.8 PERCENT IN 2002 COMPARED TO

39.3 PERCENT IN 2001. DURING 2002, THE COMPANY CONTINUED TO BENEFIT FROM FAVORABLE RESOLUTION OF TAX-RELATED ISSUES. EXCISE AND ALL OTHER TAXES AND DUTIES WERE $57.8 BILLION.

2001

INCOME, EXCISE AND ALL OTHER TAXES AND DUTIES TOTALED $66.5 BILLION IN 2001, A DECREASE OF $1.9 BILLION OR 3 PERCENT FROM 2000. INCOME TAX EXPENSE, BOTH

CURRENT AND DEFERRED, WAS $9.0 BILLION COMPARED TO $11.1 BILLION IN 2000, REFLECTING LOWER PRE-TAX INCOME IN 2001. THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE OF 39.3 PERCENT IN 2001 COMPARED TO 42.6 PERCENT IN 2000, BENEFITING FROM A HIGHER LEVEL OF FAVORABLY RESOLVED

TAX-RELATED ISSUES. EXCISE AND ALL OTHER TAXES AND DUTIES WERE $57.6 BILLION.

MARKET RISKS, INFLATION AND OTHER UNCERTAINTIES

IN THE PAST, CRUDE, NATURAL GAS, PETROLEUM PRODUCT AND CHEMICAL PRICES HAVE FLUCTUATED WIDELY IN RESPONSE TO CHANGING MARKET FORCES. THE IMPACTS OF THESE PRICE FLUCTUATIONS ON EARNINGS FROM UPSTREAM OPERATIONS, DOWNSTREAM OPERATIONS

AND CHEMICALS OPERATIONS HAVE BEEN VAR-

DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

IED, TENDING AT TIMES TO BE OFFSETTING. NONETHELESS, THE GLOBAL ENERGY MARKETS CAN GIVE RISE TO EXTENDED PERIODS IN WHICH MARKET CONDITIONS ARE ADVERSE TO ONE OR MORE OF THE CORPORATIONS BUSINESSES. SUCH CONDITIONS, ALONG WITH

THE CAPITAL-INTENSIVE NATURE OF THE INDUSTRY AND VERY LONG LEAD TIMES ASSOCIATED WITH MANY OF OUR PROJECTS, UNDERSCORE THE IMPORTANCE OF MAINTAINING A STRONG FINANCIAL POSITION. MANAGEMENT VIEWS THE CORPORATIONS FINANCIAL STRENGTH, INCLUDING

THE AAA AND AAA RATINGS OF ITS LONG-TERM DEBT SECURITIES BY STANDARD AND POORS AND MOODYS, AS A COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE.

ALTHOUGH PRICE LEVELS OF CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS MAY RISE OR FALL SIGNIFICANTLY OVER THE SHORT- TO MEDIUM TERM DUE TO POLITICAL EVENTS,

OPEC ACTIONS AND OTHER FACTORS, INDUSTRY PRICES OVER THE LONG TERM WILL CONTINUE TO BE DRIVEN BY MARKET SUPPLY AND DEMAND FUNDAMENTALS. ACCORDINGLY, THE CORPORATION TESTS THE VIABILITY OF ALL OF ITS ASSETS BASED ON LONG-TERM PRICE PROJECTIONS. THE

CORPORATIONS ASSESSMENT IS THAT ITS OPERATIONS WILL CONTINUE TO BE SUCCESSFUL IN A VARIETY OF MARKET CONDITIONS. THIS IS THE OUTCOME OF DISCIPLINED INVESTMENT AND ASSET MANAGEMENT PROGRAMS. INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES ARE TESTED AGAINST A VARIETY

OF MARKET CONDITIONS, INCLUDING LOW PRICE SCENARIOS. AS A RESULT, INVESTMENTS THAT WOULD SUCCEED ONLY IN HIGHLY FAVORABLE PRICE ENVIRONMENTS ARE SCREENED OUT OF THE INVESTMENT PLAN.

THE CORPORATION HAS HAD AN ACTIVE ASSET MANAGEMENT PROGRAM IN WHICH UNDER-PERFORMING ASSETS ARE EITHER

IMPROVED TO ACCEPTABLE LEVELS OR CONSIDERED FOR DIVESTMENT. THE ASSET MANAGEMENT PROGRAM INVOLVES A DISCIPLINED, REGULAR REVIEW TO ENSURE THAT ALL ASSETS ARE CONTRIBUTING TO THE CORPORATIONS STRATEGIC AND FINANCIAL OBJECTIVES. THE RESULT HAS

BEEN THE CREATION OF A VERY EFFICIENT CAPITAL BASE AND HAS MEANT THAT THE CORPORATION HAS SELDOM BEEN REQUIRED TO WRITE-DOWN THE CARRYING VALUE OF ASSETS, EVEN DURING PERIODS OF LOW COMMODITY PRICES.

RISK MANAGEMENT

THE CORPORATIONS SIZE, GEOGRAPHIC DIVERSITY AND THE COMPLEMENTARY

NATURE OF THE UPSTREAM, DOWNSTREAM AND CHEMICALS BUSINESSES MITIGATE THE CORPORATIONS RISK FROM CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES, CURRENCY RATES AND COMMODITY PRICES. THE CORPORATION RELIES ON THESE OPERATING ATTRIBUTES AND STRENGTHS TO REDUCE

ENTERPRISE-WIDE RISK. AS A RESULT, THE CORPORATION MAKES LIMITED USE OF DERIVATIVES TO OFFSET EXPOSURES ARISING FROM EXISTING TRANSACTIONS.

THE CORPORATION DOES NOT TRADE IN DERIVATIVES NOR DOES IT USE DERIVATIVES WITH LEVERAGE FEATURES. THE CORPORATION MAINTAINS A SYSTEM OF

CONTROLS THAT INCLUDES A POLICY COVERING THE AUTHORIZATION, REPORTING, AND MONITORING OF DERIVATIVE ACTIVITY. THE CORPORATIONS DERIVATIVE ACTIVITIES POSE NO MATERIAL CREDIT OR MARKET RISKS TO EXXONMOBILS OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL CONDITION

OR LIQUIDITY. INTEREST RATE, FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATE AND COMMODITY PRICE EXPOSURES ARISING FROM DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS UNDERTAKEN IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE CORPORATIONS POLICIES HAVE NOT BEEN SIGNIFICANT.

THE FAIR VALUE OF DERIVATIVES OUTSTANDING AND RECORDED ON THE

BALANCE SHEET WAS A NET RECEIVABLE OF $20 MILLION BEFORE-TAX AND A NET PAYABLE OF $50 MILLION BEFORE-TAX AT YEAR-END 2002 AND 2001, RESPECTIVELY. THIS IS THE AMOUNT THAT THE CORPORATION WOULD HAVE RECEIVED OR PAID TO THIRD PARTIES IF THESE

DERIVATIVES HAD BEEN SETTLED. THESE DERIVATIVE FAIR VALUES WERE SUBSTANTIALLY OFFSET BY THE FAIR VALUES OF THE UNDERLYING EXPOSURES BEING HEDGED. THE CORPORATION RECOGNIZED A BEFORE-TAX LOSS OF $35 MILLION AND A BEFORE-TAX GAIN OF $23 MILLION

RELATED TO DERIVATIVE ACTIVITY DURING 2002 AND 2001, RESPECTIVELY. THE LOSSES/GAINS INCLUDED THE OFFSETTING AMOUNTS FROM THE CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE OF THE ITEMS BEING HEDGED BY THE DERIVATIVES. THE FAIR VALUE OF DERIVATIVES OUTSTANDING AT YEAR-END

2002 AND LOSSES RECOGNIZED DURING THE YEAR ARE IMMATERIAL IN RELATION TO THE CORPORATIONS YEAR-END CASH BALANCE OF $7.2 BILLION, TOTAL ASSETS OF $152.6 BILLION, OR NET INCOME FOR THE YEAR OF $11.5 BILLION.

DEBT-RELATED INSTRUMENTS

THE CORPORATION IS EXPOSED TO CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES, PRIMARILY AS A

RESULT OF ITS SHORT-TERM DEBT AND LONG-TERM DEBT CARRYING FLOATING INTEREST RATES. THE CORPORATION MAKES LIMITED USE OF INTEREST RATE SWAP AGREEMENTS TO ADJUST THE RATIO OF FIXED AND FLOATING RATES IN THE DEBT PORTFOLIO. THE IMPACT OF A 100 BASIS

POINT CHANGE IN INTEREST RATES AFFECTING THE CORPORATIONS DEBT WOULD NOT BE MATERIAL TO EARNINGS, CASH FLOW OR FAIR VALUE.

FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE INSTRUMENTS

THE CORPORATION CONDUCTS BUSINESS IN MANY FOREIGN CURRENCIES AND IS SUBJECT TO FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE RISK ON CASH FLOWS RELATED TO SALES,

EXPENSES, FINANCING AND INVESTMENT TRANSACTIONS. THE IMPACTS OF FLUCTUATIONS IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES ON EXXONMOBILS GEOGRAPHICALLY DIVERSE OPERATIONS ARE VARIED AND OFTEN OFFSETTING IN AMOUNT. THE CORPORATION MAKES LIMITED USE OF

CURRENCY EXCHANGE CONTRACTS TO REDUCE THE RISK OF ADVERSE FOREIGN CURRENCY MOVEMENTS RELATED TO CERTAIN FOREIGN CURRENCY DEBT OBLIGATIONS. EXPOSURE FROM MARKET RATE FLUCTUATIONS RELATED TO THESE CONTRACTS IS NOT MATERIAL. AGGREGATE FOREIGN EXCHANGE

TRANSACTION GAINS AND LOSSES INCLUDED IN NET INCOME ARE DISCUSSED IN NOTE 5 ON PAGE 45.

COMMODITY INSTRUMENTS

THE

CORPORATION MAKES LIMITED USE OF COMMODITY FORWARDS, SWAPS AND FUTURES CONTRACTS OF SHORT DURATION TO MITIGATE THE RISK OF UNFAVORABLE PRICE MOVEMENTS ON CERTAIN CRUDE, NATURAL GAS AND PETROLEUM PRODUCT PURCHASES AND SALES. COMMODITY PRICE EXPOSURE

RELATED TO THESE CONTRACTS IS NOT MATERIAL.

INFLATION AND

OTHER UNCERTAINTIES

THE GENERAL RATE OF INFLATION IN MOST

MAJOR COUNTRIES OF OPERATION HAS BEEN RELATIVELY LOW IN RECENT YEARS, AND THE ASSOCIATED IMPACT ON OPERATING COSTS HAS BEEN COUNTERED BY COST REDUCTIONS FROM EFFICIENCY AND PRODUCTIVITY IMPROVEMENTS.

THE OPERATIONS AND EARNINGS OF THE CORPORATION AND ITS

AFFILIATES THROUGHOUT THE WORLD HAVE BEEN, AND MAY IN THE FUTURE BE, AFFECTED FROM TIME TO TIME IN VARYING DEGREE BY POLITICAL DEVELOPMENTS AND LAWS AND REGULATIONS, SUCH AS FORCED DIVESTITURE OF ASSETS; RESTRICTIONS ON PRODUCTION, IMPORTS AND

EXPORTS; PRICE CONTROLS; TAX INCREASES AND RETROACTIVE TAX CLAIMS; EXPROPRIATION OF PROPERTY; CANCELLATION OF CONTRACT RIGHTS AND ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS. BOTH THE LIKELIHOOD OF SUCH OCCURRENCES AND THEIR OVERALL EFFECT UPON THE CORPORATION VARY

GREATLY FROM COUNTRY TO COUNTRY AND ARE NOT PREDICTABLE.

RECENTLY ISSUED STATEMENTS OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

IN AUGUST 2001, THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD ISSUED STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS NO. 143 (FAS 143), ACCOUNTING FOR ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS. FAS 143 IS REQUIRED TO BE ADOPTED BY THE

CORPORATION NO LATER THAN JANUARY 1, 2003, AND ITS PRIMARY IMPACT WILL BE TO CHANGE THE METHOD OF ACCRUING FOR UPSTREAM SITE RESTORATION COSTS. THESE COSTS ARE CURRENTLY ACCRUED RATABLY OVER THE PRODUCTIVE LIVES OF THE ASSETS IN ACCORDANCE WITH

STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS NO. 19 (FAS 19), FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING AND REPORTING BY OIL AND GAS PRODUCING COMPANIES. AT THE END OF 2002, THE CUMULATIVE AMOUNT ACCRUED UNDER THIS POLICY WAS APPROXIMATELY

34

TABLE OF CONTENTS

$3.5 BILLION. UNDER FAS 143,

THE FAIR VALUE OF ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS WILL BE RECORDED AS LIABILITIES ON A DISCOUNTED BASIS WHEN THEY ARE INCURRED, WHICH ARE TYPICALLY AT THE TIME THE ASSETS ARE INSTALLED. AMOUNTS RECORDED FOR THE RELATED ASSETS WILL BE INCREASED BY THE

AMOUNT OF THESE OBLIGATIONS. OVER TIME THE LIABILITIES WILL BE ACCRETED FOR THE CHANGE IN THEIR PRESENT VALUE AND THE INITIAL CAPITALIZED COSTS WILL BE DEPRECIATED OVER THE USEFUL LIVES OF THE RELATED ASSETS.

THE CUMULATIVE ADJUSTMENT FOR THE CHANGE IN ACCOUNTING

PRINCIPLE WILL RESULT IN AFTER-TAX INCOME OF APPROXIMATELY $600 MILLION AS OF JANUARY 1, 2003. THIS ADJUSTMENT IS DUE TO THE DIFFERENCE IN THE METHOD OF ACCRUING SITE RESTORATION COSTS UNDER FAS 143 COMPARED WITH THE METHOD REQUIRED BY FAS 19, THE

ACCOUNTING STANDARD THAT THE CORPORATION HAS BEEN REQUIRED TO FOLLOW SINCE 1978. UNDER FAS 19, SITE RESTORATION COSTS ARE ACCRUED ON A UNIT-OF-PRODUCTION BASIS OF ACCOUNTING AS THE OIL AND GAS IS PRODUCED. THE FAS 19 METHOD MATCHES THE ACCRUALS WITH

THE REVENUES GENERATED FROM PRODUCTION AND RESULTS IN MOST OF THE COSTS BEING ACCRUED EARLY IN FIELD LIFE, WHEN PRODUCTION IS AT THE HIGHEST LEVEL. BECAUSE FAS 143 REQUIRES ACCRETION OF THE LIABILITY AS A RESULT OF THE PASSAGE OF TIME USING AN

INTEREST METHOD OF ALLOCATION, THE MAJORITY OF THE COSTS WILL BE ACCRUED TOWARDS THE END OF FIELD LIFE, WHEN PRODUCTION IS AT THE LOWEST LEVEL. THE CUMULATIVE INCOME ADJUSTMENT DESCRIBED ABOVE RESULTS FROM REVERSING THE HIGHER LIABILITY ACCUMULATED

UNDER FAS 19 IN ORDER TO ADJUST IT TO THE LOWER PRESENT VALUE AMOUNT RESULTING FROM TRANSITION TO FAS 143. THIS AMOUNT BEING REVERSED IN TRANSITION, WHICH WAS PREVIOUSLY CHARGED TO OPERATING EARNINGS UNDER FAS 19, WILL AGAIN BE CHARGED TO THOSE

EARNINGS UNDER FAS 143 IN FUTURE YEARS. BECAUSE OF THE LONG PERIODS OVER WHICH THESE COSTS WILL BE CHARGED, THE IMPACT ON FUTURE ANNUAL NET INCOME OF THESE INCREASED CHARGES WILL BE IMMATERIAL.

IN NOVEMBER 2002, THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD

ISSUED FASB INTERPRETATION NO. 45 (FIN 45), GUARANTORS ACCOUNTING AND DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS FOR GUARANTEES, INCLUDING INDIRECT GUARANTEES OF INDEBTEDNESS OF OTHERS. THIS INTERPRETATION IS EFFECTIVE FOR GUARANTEES ISSUED OR

MODIFIED AFTER DECEMBER 31, 2002 AND REQUIRES THAT A LIABILITY BE RECOGNIZED AT FAIR VALUE UPON ISSUANCE OF THE GUARANTEES. THE IMPACT OF FIN 45 ON THE CORPORATIONS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS WILL NOT BE MATERIAL.

IN JANUARY 2003, THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD

ISSUED FASB INTERPRETATION NO. 46 (FIN 46), CONSOLIDATION OF VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES. A DISCUSSION OF FIN 46 AND RELATED FINANCIAL STATEMENT IMPLICATIONS FOR THE CORPORATION IS INCLUDED IN NOTE 8 ON PAGE 46.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

THE

CORPORATIONS ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL REPORTING FAIRLY REFLECT ITS STRAIGHTFORWARD BUSINESS MODEL INVOLVING THE EXTRACTING, REFINING AND MARKETING OF HYDROCARBONS AND HYDROCARBON-BASED PRODUCTS. THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN

CONFORMITY WITH U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES (GAAP) REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS THAT AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS, LIABILITIES, REVENUES AND EXPENSES AND THE DISCLOSURE OF CONTINGENT ASSETS AND

LIABILITIES. THE FOLLOWING SUMMARY PROVIDES FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT THE CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND THE JUDGMENTS THAT ARE MADE BY THE CORPORATION IN THE APPLICATION OF THOSE POLICIES.

OIL AND GAS RESERVES

EVALUATIONS OF OIL AND GAS RESERVES ARE IMPORTANT TO THE EFFECTIVE MANAGEMENT

OF UPSTREAM ASSETS. THEY ARE INTEGRAL TO MAKING INVESTMENT DECISIONS ABOUT OIL AND GAS PROPERTIES SUCH AS WHETHER DEVELOPMENT SHOULD PROCEED OR ENHANCED RECOVERY METHODS SHOULD BE UNDERTAKEN. OIL AND GAS RESERVE QUANTITIES ARE ALSO USED AS THE BASIS

OF CALCULATING THE UNIT-OF-PRODUCTION RATES FOR DEPRECIATION AND EVALUATING FOR IMPAIRMENT. OIL AND GAS RESERVES ARE DIVIDED BETWEEN PROVED AND UNPROVED RESERVES. PROVED RESERVES ARE THE ESTIMATED QUANTITIES OF CRUDE OIL, NATURAL GAS AND NATURAL GAS

LIQUIDS THAT GEOLOGICAL AND ENGINEERING DATA DEMONSTRATE WITH REASONABLE CERTAINTY TO BE RECOVERABLE IN FUTURE YEARS FROM KNOWN RESERVOIRS UNDER EXISTING ECONOMIC AND OPERATING CONDITIONS, I.E., PRICES AND COSTS AS OF THE DATE THE ESTIMATE IS MADE.

UNPROVED RESERVES ARE THOSE WITH LESS THAN REASONABLE CERTAINTY OF RECOVERABILITY AND ARE CLASSIFIED AS EITHER PROBABLE OR POSSIBLE. PROBABLE RESERVES ARE RESERVES THAT ARE MORE LIKELY TO BE RECOVERED THAN NOT AND POSSIBLE RESERVES ARE LESS LIKELY

TO BE RECOVERED THAN NOT.

THE ESTIMATION OF

PROVED RESERVES IS AN ONGOING PROCESS BASED ON RIGOROUS TECHNICAL EVALUATIONS AND EXTRAPOLATIONS OF WELL INFORMATION SUCH AS FLOW RATES AND RESERVOIR PRESSURE DECLINES. IN CERTAIN DEEPWATER FIELDS, PROVED RESERVES ARE OCCASIONALLY RECORDED BEFORE

FLOW TESTS ARE CONDUCTED BECAUSE OF THE SAFETY AND COST IMPLICATIONS OF CONDUCTING THE TESTS. IN THOSE SITUATIONS, OTHER INDUSTRY ACCEPTED ANALYSES ARE USED SUCH AS INFORMATION FROM WELL LOGS, A THOROUGH PRESSURE AND FLUID SAMPLING PROGRAM,

CONVENTIONAL CORE DATA OBTAINED ACROSS THE ENTIRE RESERVOIR INTERVAL AND NEARBY ANALOG DATA. HISTORICALLY, PROVED RESERVES RECORDED USING THESE METHODS HAVE BEEN IMMATERIAL WHEN COMPARED TO THE CORPORATIONS TOTAL PROVED RESERVES AND HAVE ALSO

BEEN VALIDATED BY SUBSEQUENT FLOW TESTS OR ACTUAL PRODUCTION LEVELS. IN ADDITION, THE CORPORATION RECORDS PROVED RESERVES IN CONJUNCTION WITH SIGNIFICANT FUNDING COMMITMENTS MADE TOWARDS THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE RESERVES.

AT YEAR-END 2002, PROVED OIL AND GAS RESERVES WERE 21.1

BILLION OIL-EQUIVALENT BARRELS. THE CORPORATION ADDED 1.9 BILLION OIL-EQUIVALENT BARRELS TO PROVED RESERVES IN 2002, WHILE PRODUCING 1.6 BILLION OIL-EQUIVALENT BARRELS, REPLACING 120 PERCENT OF RESERVES PRODUCED, EXCLUDING SALES. WITH SALES

INCLUDED, THE CORPORATION REPLACED 119 PERCENT OF RESERVES PRODUCED. BOTH RESERVE REPLACEMENT PERCENTAGES EXCLUDE TAR SANDS. THIS IS THE NINTH CONSECUTIVE YEAR THAT THE CORPORATIONS RESERVES REPLACEMENT HAS EXCEEDED 100 PERCENT.

THE CORPORATION USES THE SUCCESSFUL EFFORTS METHOD

TO ACCOUNT FOR ITS EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION ACTIVITIES. UNDER THIS METHOD, COSTS ARE ACCUMULATED ON A FIELD-BY-FIELD BASIS WITH CERTAIN EXPLORATORY EXPENDITURES AND EXPLORATORY DRY HOLES BEING EXPENSED AS INCURRED. EXPLORATORY WELLS THAT FIND OIL

AND GAS IN AN AREA REQUIRING A MAJOR CAPITAL EXPENDITURE BEFORE PRODUCTION CAN BEGIN ARE EVALUATED ANNUALLY TO ENSURE THAT COMMERCIAL QUANTITIES OF RESERVES HAVE BEEN FOUND OR THAT ADDITIONAL EXPLORATION WORK IS UNDER WAY OR PLANNED. EXPLORATORY

WELL COSTS NOT MEETING EITHER OF THESE TESTS ARE CHARGED TO EXPENSE. COSTS OF PRODUCTIVE WELLS AND DEVELOPMENT DRY HOLES ARE CAPITALIZED AND AMORTIZED ON THE UNIT-OF-PRODUCTION METHOD FOR EACH FIELD. THE CORPORATION USES THIS ACCOUNTING POLICY

INSTEAD OF THE FULL COST METHOD BECAUSE IT PROVIDES A MORE TIMELY ACCOUNTING OF THE SUCCESS OR FAILURE OF THE CORPORATIONS EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION ACTIVITIES. IF THE FULL COST METHOD WERE USED, ALL COSTS WOULD BE CAPITALIZED AND

DEPRECIATED ON A COUNTRY BY-COUNTRY BASIS. THE CAPITALIZED COSTS WOULD BE SUBJECT TO AN IMPAIRMENT TEST BY COUNTRY. THE FULL COST METHOD WOULD TEND TO DELAY THE EXPENSE RECOGNITION OF UNSUCCESSFUL PROJECTS.

IMPACT OF OIL AND GAS RESERVES ON DEPRECIATION.

THE CALCULATION OF

UNIT-OF-PRODUCTION DEPRECIATION IS A CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATE THAT MEASURES THE DEPRECIATION OF UPSTREAM ASSETS. IT IS THE RATIO OF (1) ACTUAL VOLUMES PRODUCED TO (2) TOTAL PROVED DEVELOPED RESERVES (THOSE

MANAGEMENTS

DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

PROVED RESERVES RECOVERABLE THROUGH EXISTING WELLS WITH EXISTING EQUIPMENT AND OPERATING METHODS) APPLIED TO THE (3) ASSET COST. THE VOLUMES PRODUCED AND ASSET COST ARE KNOWN AND WHILE PROVED DEVELOPED RESERVES HAVE A HIGH

PROBABILITY OF RECOVERABILITY THEY ARE BASED ON ESTIMATES THAT ARE SUBJECT TO SOME VARIABILITY. THIS VARIABILITY HAS GENERALLY RESULTED IN NET UPWARD REVISIONS OF PROVED RESERVES IN EXISTING FIELDS, AS MORE INFORMATION BECOMES AVAILABLE THROUGH

RESEARCH AND PRODUCTION. REVISIONS HAVE AVERAGED 670 MILLION OIL-EQUIVALENT BARRELS PER YEAR OVER THE LAST FIVE YEARS, AND HAVE RESULTED FROM EFFECTIVE RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT AND THE APPLICATION OF NEW TECHNOLOGY. WHILE THE UPWARD REVISIONS THE

CORPORATION HAS MADE IN THE PAST ARE AN INDICATOR OF VARIABILITY, THEY HAVE HAD A VERY SMALL IMPACT ON THE UNIT-OF-PRODUCTION RATES BECAUSE THEY HAVE BEEN SMALL COMPARED TO THE LARGE RESERVES BASE.

IMPACT OF OIL AND GAS RESERVES AND PRICES ON TESTING FOR IMPAIRMENT.

OIL AND GAS PRODUCING PROPERTIES ARE REVIEWED FOR IMPAIRMENT WHENEVER EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THAT THE CARRYING AMOUNTS MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE. THE CORPORATION ESTIMATES THE FUTURE UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS OF THE AFFECTED

PROPERTIES TO JUDGE THE RECOVERABILITY OF CARRYING AMOUNTS. IN GENERAL, ANALYSES ARE BASED ON PROVED RESERVES, EXCEPT IN CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE IT IS PROBABLE THAT ADDITIONAL NON-PROVED RESERVES WILL BE DEVELOPED AND CONTRIBUTE TO CASH FLOWS IN THE

FUTURE.

THE CORPORATION PERFORMS ASSET VALUATION

ANALYSES ON AN ONGOING BASIS AS A PART OF ITS ASSET MANAGEMENT PROGRAM. THESE ANALYSES MONITOR THE PERFORMANCE OF ASSETS AGAINST CORPORATE OBJECTIVES. THEY ALSO ASSIST THE CORPORATION IN REVIEWING WHETHER THE CARRYING AMOUNTS OF ANY OF ITS ASSETS

MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE. IN ADDITION TO ESTIMATING OIL AND GAS RESERVE VOLUMES IN CONDUCTING THESE ANALYSES, IT IS ALSO NECESSARY TO ESTIMATE FUTURE OIL AND GAS PRICES.

IN GENERAL, THE CORPORATION DOES NOT VIEW TEMPORARILY LOW OIL PRICES AS A TRIGGER EVENT FOR CONDUCTING THE

IMPAIRMENT TESTS. THE MARKETS FOR CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS HAVE A HISTORY OF SIGNIFICANT PRICE VOLATILITY. ALTHOUGH PRICES WILL OCCASIONALLY DROP PRECIPITOUSLY, INDUSTRY PRICES OVER THE LONG TERM WILL CONTINUE TO BE DRIVEN BY MARKET SUPPLY AND

DEMAND FUNDAMENTALS. ACCORDINGLY, ANY IMPAIRMENT TESTS THAT THE CORPORATION PERFORMS MAKE USE OF THE CORPORATIONS LONG-TERM PRICE ASSUMPTIONS FOR THE CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS MARKETS. THESE ARE THE SAME PRICE ASSUMPTIONS THAT ARE USED IN THE

CORPORATIONS PLANNING AND BUDGETING PROCESSES AND ITS CAPITAL INVESTMENT DECISIONS. SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION REGARDING OIL AND GAS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, CAPITALIZED COSTS AND RESERVES CAN BE FOUND ON PAGES 62 TO 66.

CONSOLIDATIONS

THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDE THE ACCOUNTS OF THOSE

SIGNIFICANT SUBSIDIARIES THAT THE CORPORATION CONTROLS. THEY ALSO INCLUDE THE CORPORATIONS UNDIVIDED INTERESTS IN UPSTREAM ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. AMOUNTS REPRESENTING THE CORPORATIONS PERCENTAGE INTEREST IN THE UNDERLYING NET ASSETS OF

OTHER SIGNIFICANT AFFILIATES THAT IT DOES NOT CONTROL, BUT EXERCISES SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE, ARE INCLUDED IN INVESTMENTS AND ADVANCES; THE CORPORATIONS SHARE OF THE NET INCOME OF THESE COMPANIES IS INCLUDED IN THE CONSOLIDATED

STATEMENT OF INCOME CAPTION EARNINGS FROM EQUITY INTERESTS AND OTHER REVENUE. THE ACCOUNTING FOR THESE NON-CONSOLIDATED COMPANIES IS REFERRED TO AS THE EQUITY METHOD OF ACCOUNTING.

ADDITIONAL DISCLOSURES OF SUMMARY BALANCE SHEET AND INCOME

INFORMATION FOR THOSE SUBSIDIARIES ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER THE EQUITY METHOD OF ACCOUNTING CAN BE FOUND IN NOTE 8 ON PAGE 46. THE CORPORATION BELIEVES THIS TO BE IMPORTANT INFORMATION NECESSARY TO A FULL UNDERSTANDING OF THE CORPORATIONS FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS.

INVESTMENTS IN COMPANIES THAT ARE

PARTIALLY OWNED BY THE CORPORATION ARE INTEGRAL TO THE CORPORATIONS OPERATIONS. IN SOME CASES THEY SERVE TO BALANCE WORLDWIDE RISKS AND IN OTHERS THEY PROVIDE THE ONLY AVAILABLE MEANS OF ENTRY INTO A PARTICULAR MARKET OR AREA OF INTEREST. THE

OTHER PARTIES WHO ALSO HAVE AN EQUITY INTEREST IN THESE COMPANIES ARE EITHER INDEPENDENT THIRD PARTIES OR HOST GOVERNMENTS THAT SHARE IN THE BUSINESS RESULTS ACCORDING TO THEIR PERCENTAGE OWNERSHIP. THE CORPORATION DOES NOT INVEST IN THESE COMPANIES

IN ORDER TO REMOVE LIABILITIES FROM ITS BALANCE SHEET. IN FACT, THE CORPORATION HAS LONG BEEN ON RECORD SUPPORTING AN ALTERNATIVE ACCOUNTING METHOD THAT WOULD REQUIRE EACH INVESTOR TO CONSOLIDATE ITS PERCENTAGE SHARE OF ALL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES IN

THESE PARTIALLY OWNED COMPANIES RATHER THAN ONLY THE PERCENTAGE IN THE NET EQUITY. THIS METHOD OF ACCOUNTING FOR INVESTMENTS IN PARTIALLY OWNED COMPANIES IS NOT PERMITTED BY GAAP EXCEPT WHERE THE INVESTMENTS ARE IN THE DIRECT OWNERSHIP OF A SHARE IN

THE UPSTREAM ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. HOWEVER, FOR PURPOSES OF CALCULATING RETURN ON AVERAGE CAPITAL EMPLOYED, WHICH IS NOT COVERED BY GAAP STANDARDS, THE CORPORATION INCLUDES ITS SHARE OF DEBT OF THESE PARTIALLY OWNED COMPANIES IN THE DETERMINATION

OF AVERAGE CAPITAL EMPLOYED.

ANNUITY PLANS

THE CORPORATION AND ITS AFFILIATES SPONSOR OVER 100 DEFINED BENEFIT (PENSION)

PLANS IN MORE THAN 50 COUNTRIES. THE FUNDING ARRANGEMENT FOR EACH PLAN DEPENDS ON THE PREVAILING PRACTICES AND REGULATIONS OF THE COUNTRIES WHERE THE COMPANY OPERATES. NOTE 18, PAGES 57-58, PROVIDES DETAILS ON PENSION OBLIGATIONS, FUND ASSETS AND

PENSION EXPENSE.

SOME OF THESE PLANS (PRIMARILY

NON-U.S.) PROVIDE PENSION BENEFITS WHICH ARE PAID DIRECTLY BY THEIR SPONSORING AFFILIATES OUT OF CORPORATE CASH FLOW RATHER THAN A SEPARATE PENSION FUND. BOOK RESERVES ARE ESTABLISHED FOR THESE PLANS, BECAUSE TAX CONVENTIONS AND REGULATORY PRACTICES

DO NOT ENCOURAGE ADVANCE FUNDING. THE PORTION OF THE PENSION COST ATTRIBUTABLE TO EMPLOYEE SERVICE IS EXPENSED AS SERVICES ARE RENDERED. THE PORTION ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE INCREASE IN PENSION OBLIGATIONS DUE TO THE PASSAGE OF TIME IS EXPENSED OVER THE

TERM OF THE OBLIGATIONS, WHICH ENDS WHEN ALL BENEFITS ARE PAID. THE PRIMARY DIFFERENCE IN PENSION EXPENSE FOR UNFUNDED VERSUS FUNDED PLANS IS THAT PENSION EXPENSE FOR FUNDED PLANS ALSO INCLUDES A CREDIT FOR THE EXPECTED LONG-TERM RETURN ON FUND

ASSETS. THE CORPORATION USES THE FAIR VALUE OF PLAN ASSETS AT YEAR-END TO DETERMINE ITS ANNUAL PENSION EXPENSE AND DOES NOT USE A MOVING AVERAGE VALUE ALLOWED BY GAAP TO REDUCE THE VOLATILITY OF PENSION EXPENSE.

FOR FUNDED PLANS, INCLUDING MANY IN THE U.S., PENSION

OBLIGATIONS ARE FINANCED IN ADVANCE THROUGH SEGREGATED ASSETS OR INSURANCE ARRANGEMENTS. THESE PLANS ARE MANAGED IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE REQUIREMENTS OF GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORITIES, AND MEET OR EXCEED REQUIRED FUNDING LEVELS AS MEASURED BY RELEVANT

ACTUARIAL AND GOVERNMENT STANDARDS AT THE MANDATED MEASUREMENT DATES. IN DETERMINING LIABILITIES AND REQUIRED CONTRIBUTIONS, THESE STANDARDS OFTEN REQUIRE APPROACHES AND ASSUMPTIONS WHICH DIFFER FROM THOSE USED FOR ACCOUNTING PURPOSES. CONTRIBUTIONS

TO FUNDED PLANS TOTALED $969 MILLION IN 2002 (U.S. $460 MILLION, NON-U.S. $509 MILLION).

36

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE

CORPORATION WILL CONTINUE TO MAKE CONTRIBUTIONS TO THESE FUNDED PLANS AS NECESSARY. ALL DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION OBLIGATIONS, REGARDLESS OF THE FUNDING STATUS OF THE UNDERLYING PLANS, ARE FULLY SUPPORTED BY THE FINANCIAL STRENGTH OF THE CORPORATION

OR THE RESPECTIVE SPONSORING AFFILIATE.

PENSION

ACCOUNTING REQUIRES EXPLICIT ASSUMPTIONS REGARDING, AMONG OTHERS, THE LONG-TERM EXPECTED EARNINGS RATE ON FUND ASSETS, THE DISCOUNT RATE FOR THE BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS, AND THE LONG-TERM RATE FOR FUTURE SALARY INCREASES. ALL THE PENSION ASSUMPTIONS ARE

REVIEWED ANNUALLY BY OUTSIDE ACTUARIES AND SENIOR FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT. THESE ASSUMPTIONS ARE ADJUSTED ONLY AS APPROPRIATE TO REFLECT CHANGES IN MARKET RATES AND OUTLOOK. FOR EXAMPLE, THE LONG-TERM EXPECTED EARNINGS RATE ON U.S. PENSION PLAN ASSETS

HAS BEEN EVALUATED ANNUALLY, BUT WAS CHANGED ONLY TWICE IN THE PAST 15 YEARS, IN BOTH CASES DOWNWARD. THE EXPECTED EARNINGS RATE OF 9.5 PERCENT USED IN 2002 COMPARES TO ACTUAL RETURNS OF 10 PERCENT AND 11 PERCENT ACTUALLY ACHIEVED OVER THE LAST 10-

AND 20-YEAR PERIODS ENDING DECEMBER 31, 2002. BASED ON THE MOST RECENT FORWARD-LOOKING ANALYSIS, AN EXPECTED EARNINGS RATE OF 9.0 PERCENT WILL BE USED FOR THE U.S. PLANS IN 2003. A WORLDWIDE REDUCTION OF 0.5 PERCENT IN THE PENSION FUND EARNINGS RATE

WOULD INCREASE PENSION EXPENSE BY APPROXIMATELY $60 MILLION BEFORE-TAX.

DUE TO THE GENERAL DECLINE IN THE MARKET VALUE OF PENSION ASSETS AND IN INTEREST RATES, PENSION EXPENSE GREW FROM $451 MILLION IN 2001 (U.S. $145 MILLION, NON-U.S. $306 MILLION) TO $995 MILLION IN 2002 (U.S. $470 MILLION,

NON-U.S. $525 MILLION), AND IS EXPECTED TO FURTHER INCREASE IN 2003. UNDER U.S. GAAP, DIFFERENCES BETWEEN ACTUAL RETURNS ON FUND ASSETS VERSUS THE LONG-TERM EXPECTED RETURN ARE AMORTIZED IN PENSION EXPENSE, ALONG WITH OTHER ACTUARIAL GAINS AND

LOSSES, OVER THE EXPECTED REMAINING SERVICE LIFE OF EMPLOYEES.

LITIGATION AND OTHER CONTINGENCIES

CLAIMS FOR SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNTS HAVE BEEN MADE AGAINST EXXONMOBIL AND CERTAIN OF ITS CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES IN PENDING LAWSUITS AND TAX DISPUTES. THESE ARE SUMMARIZED ON PAGE 32, WITH A MORE EXTENSIVE DISCUSSION INCLUDED IN NOTE 17

ON PAGE 56.

THE GENERAL GUIDANCE PROVIDED BY

GAAP REQUIRES THAT LIABILITIES FOR CONTINGENCIES SHOULD BE RECORDED WHEN IT IS PROBABLE THAT A LIABILITY HAS BEEN INCURRED BEFORE THE DATE OF THE BALANCE SHEET AND THAT THE AMOUNT CAN BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED. SIGNIFICANT MANAGEMENT JUDGMENT IS

REQUIRED TO COMPLY WITH THIS GUIDANCE, AND IT INCLUDES MANAGEMENT REVIEWS WITH THE CORPORATIONS ATTORNEYS, TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION ALL OF THE RELEVANT FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES.

FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION

THE METHOD OF TRANSLATING THE FOREIGN CURRENCY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF THE CORPORATIONS INTERNATIONAL SUBSIDIARIES INTO

U.S. DOLLARS IS PRESCRIBED BY GAAP. UNDER THESE PRINCIPLES, IT IS NECESSARY TO SELECT THE FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY OF THESE SUBSIDIARIES. THE FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY IS THE CURRENCY OF THE PRIMARY ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH THE SUBSIDIARY OPERATES.

MANAGEMENT SELECTS THE FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY AFTER EVALUATING THIS ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT. DOWNSTREAM AND CHEMICALS OPERATIONS NORMALLY USE THE LOCAL CURRENCY, EXCEPT IN HIGHLY INFLATIONARY COUNTRIES, PRIMARILY LATIN AMERICA, AS WELL AS IN SINGAPORE,

WHICH USES THE U.S. DOLLAR, BECAUSE IT PREDOMINANTLY SELLS INTO THE U.S. DOLLAR EXPORT MARKET. UPSTREAM OPERATIONS ALSO USE THE LOCAL CURRENCY AS THE FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY, EXCEPT WHERE CRUDE AND NATURAL GAS PRODUCTION IS PREDOMINANTLY SOLD IN THE

EXPORT MARKET IN U.S. DOLLARS. THESE OPERATIONS, WHICH USE THE U.S. DOLLAR AS THEIR FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY, ARE IN MALAYSIA, INDONESIA, ANGOLA, NIGERIA, EQUATORIAL GUINEA AND THE MIDDLE EAST COUNTRIES.

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

STATEMENTS IN THIS DISCUSSION REGARDING EXPECTATIONS, PLANS AND FUTURE EVENTS OR CONDITIONS ARE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS. ACTUAL FUTURE RESULTS, INCLUDING PRODUCTION GROWTH; FINANCING SOURCES; THE RESOLUTION OF CONTINGENCIES; THE

EFFECT OF CHANGES IN PRICES; INTEREST RATES AND OTHER MARKET CONDITIONS; AND ENVIRONMENTAL AND CAPITAL EXPENDITURES COULD DIFFER MATERIALLY DEPENDING ON A NUMBER OF FACTORS, SUCH AS THE OUTCOME OF COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS; CHANGES IN THE SUPPLY OF

AND DEMAND FOR CRUDE OIL, NATURAL GAS, AND PETROLEUM AND PETROCHEMICAL PRODUCTS; AND OTHER FACTORS DISCUSSED ABOVE AND UNDER THE CAPTION FACTORS AFFECTING FUTURE RESULTS IN ITEM 1 OF EXXONMOBILS 2002 FORM 10-K.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION OF INTERNAL CONTROLS FOR FINANCIAL REPORTING

MANAGEMENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ESTABLISHING AND MAINTAINING ADEQUATE INTERNAL CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES FOR THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL REPORTS. ACCORDINGLY, COMPREHENSIVE PROCEDURES AND PRACTICES ARE IN

PLACE. THESE PROCEDURES AND PRACTICES ARE DESIGNED TO PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE THAT THE CORPORATIONS TRANSACTIONS ARE PROPERLY AUTHORIZED; THE CORPORATIONS ASSETS ARE SAFEGUARDED AGAINST UNAUTHORIZED OR IMPROPER USE; AND THE

CORPORATIONS TRANSACTIONS ARE PROPERLY RECORDED AND REPORTED TO PERMIT THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN CONFORMITY WITH U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES.

INTERNAL CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES FOR FINANCIAL REPORTING ARE REGULARLY REVIEWED BY MANAGEMENT AND BY THE

EXXONMOBIL INTERNAL AUDIT FUNCTION AND FINDINGS ARE SHARED WITH THE BOARD AUDIT COMMITTEE. IN ADDITION, PRICEWATERHOUSECOOPERS, THE CORPORATIONS INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANT, WHO REPORTS TO THE BOARD AUDIT COMMITTEE, CONSIDERS AND SELECTIVELY TESTS

INTERNAL CONTROLS IN PLANNING AND PERFORMING THEIR AUDITS. MANAGEMENTS REVIEW OF THE DESIGN AND OPERATION OF THESE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES IN 2002, INCLUDING REVIEW AS OF YEAR-END, DID NOT IDENTIFY ANY SIGNIFICANT DEFICIENCIES OR MATERIAL

WEAKNESSES, INCLUDING ANY DEFICIENCIES WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE CORPORATIONS ABILITY TO RECORD, PROCESS, SUMMARIZE AND REPORT FINANCIAL DATA.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND THE SUPPORTING AND SUPPLEMENTAL MATERIAL ARE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE MANAGEMENT OF EXXON MOBIL CORPORATION.

THE CORPORATIONS PRINCIPAL BUSINESS IS ENERGY, INVOLVING THE WORLDWIDE EXPLORATION, PRODUCTION, TRANSPORTATION AND SALE OF CRUDE OIL

AND NATURAL GAS (UPSTREAM) AND THE MANUFACTURE, TRANSPORTATION AND SALE OF PETROLEUM PRODUCTS (DOWNSTREAM). THE CORPORATION IS ALSO A MAJOR WORLDWIDE MANUFACTURER AND MARKETER OF PETROCHEMICALS (CHEMICALS), AND PARTICIPATES IN ELECTRIC POWER

GENERATION (UPSTREAM).

THE PREPARATION OF

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN CONFORMITY WITH U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO MAKE ESTIMATES THAT AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS, LIABILITIES, REVENUES AND EXPENSES AND THE DISCLOSURE OF CONTINGENT ASSETS AND

LIABILITIES. ACTUAL RESULTS COULD DIFFER FROM THESE ESTIMATES.

1. SUMMARY OF ACCOUNTING POLICIES

PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION.

THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDE THE ACCOUNTS OF THOSE SIGNIFICANT SUBSIDIARIES OWNED DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY WITH MORE THAN 50 PERCENT OF THE VOTING RIGHTS HELD BY THE CORPORATION, AND

FOR WHICH OTHER SHAREHOLDERS DO NOT POSSESS THE RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN SIGNIFICANT MANAGEMENT DECISIONS. THEY ALSO INCLUDE THE CORPORATIONS SHARE OF THE UNDIVIDED INTEREST IN UPSTREAM ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. AMOUNTS REPRESENTING THE

CORPORATIONS PERCENTAGE INTEREST IN THE UNDERLYING NET ASSETS OF OTHER SIGNIFICANT SUBSIDIARIES AND LESS THAN MAJORITY OWNED COMPANIES IN WHICH A SIGNIFICANT EQUITY OWNERSHIP INTEREST IS HELD, ARE INCLUDED IN INVESTMENTS AND

ADVANCES; THE CORPORATIONS SHARE OF THE NET INCOME OF THESE COMPANIES IS INCLUDED IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF INCOME CAPTION EARNINGS FROM EQUITY INTERESTS AND OTHER REVENUE.

INVESTMENTS IN OTHER COMPANIES, NONE OF WHICH IS SIGNIFICANT,

ARE GENERALLY INCLUDED IN INVESTMENTS AND ADVANCES AT COST OR LESS. DIVIDENDS FROM THESE COMPANIES ARE INCLUDED IN INCOME AS RECEIVED.

REVENUE RECOGNITION.

REVENUES ASSOCIATED WITH SALES OF CRUDE OIL, NATURAL GAS, PETROLEUM AND CHEMICAL PRODUCTS AND ALL OTHER ITEMS ARE RECORDED

WHEN TITLE PASSES TO THE CUSTOMER.

REVENUES FROM

THE PRODUCTION OF NATURAL GAS PROPERTIES IN WHICH THE CORPORATION HAS AN INTEREST WITH THE OTHER PRODUCERS ARE RECOGNIZED ON THE BASIS OF THE COMPANYS NET WORKING INTEREST. DIFFERENCES BETWEEN ACTUAL PRODUCTION AND NET WORKING INTEREST VOLUMES

ARE NOT SIGNIFICANT.

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS.

THE

CORPORATION MAKES LIMITED USE OF DERIVATIVES. DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS ARE NOT HELD FOR TRADING PURPOSES NOR DO THEY HAVE LEVERAGE FEATURES. WHEN THE CORPORATION DOES ENTER INTO DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS, IT IS TO OFFSET EXPOSURES ASSOCIATED WITH

INTEREST RATES, FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES AND HYDROCARBON PRICES. THE GAINS AND LOSSES RESULTING FROM THE CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE OF THESE INSTRUMENTS ARE RECORDED IN INCOME, EXCEPT WHEN THE INSTRUMENTS ARE DESIGNATED AS HEDGING THE CURRENCY

EXPOSURE OF NET INVESTMENTS IN FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES, IN WHICH CASE THEY ARE RECORDED IN THE CUMULATIVE FOREIGN EXCHANGE TRANSLATION ACCOUNT, AS PART OF SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY.

THE GAINS AND LOSSES ON DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS THAT ARE DESIGNATED AS FAIR VALUE HEDGES (I.E., THOSE HEDGING

THE EXPOSURE TO CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF AN ASSET OR A LIABILITY OR THE CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF A FIRM COMMITMENT), ARE OFFSET BY THE GAINS AND LOSSES FROM THE CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE OF THE HEDGED ITEMS, WHICH ARE ALSO RECOGNIZED IN INCOME.

MOST OF THESE DESIGNATED HEDGES ARE ENTERED INTO AT THE SAME TIME THAT THE HEDGED ITEMS ARE TRANSACTED, THEY ARE FULLY EFFECTIVE AND IN COMBINATION WITH THE OFFSETTING HEDGED ITEMS, THEY RESULT IN NO NET IMPACT ON INCOME. IN SOME SITUATIONS, THE

CORPORATION HAS CHOSEN NOT TO DESIGNATE CERTAIN IMMATERIAL DERIVATIVES USED FOR HEDGING ECONOMIC EXPOSURE AS HEDGES FOR ACCOUNTING PURPOSES DUE TO THE EXCESSIVE ADMINISTRATIVE EFFORT THAT WOULD BE REQUIRED TO ACCOUNT FOR THESE ITEMS AS HEDGING

TRANSACTIONS. THESE DERIVATIVES ARE RECORDED ON THE BALANCE SHEET AT FAIR VALUE AND THE GAINS AND LOSSES ARISING FROM CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE ARE RECOGNIZED IN INCOME. ALL DERIVATIVES ACTIVITY IS IMMATERIAL.

INVENTORIES.

CRUDE OIL, PRODUCTS AND MERCHANDISE INVENTORIES ARE

CARRIED AT THE LOWER OF CURRENT MARKET VALUE OR COST (GENERALLY DETERMINED UNDER THE LAST-IN, FIRST-OUT METHOD  LIFO). COSTS INCLUDE APPLICABLE PURCHASE COSTS AND OPERATING EXPENSES BUT NOT GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES OR RESEARCH AND

DEVELOPMENT COSTS. INVENTORIES OF MATERIALS AND SUPPLIES ARE VALUED AT COST OR LESS.

PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT.

DEPRECIATION, DEPLETION AND AMORTIZATION, BASED ON COST LESS ESTIMATED SALVAGE VALUE OF THE ASSET, ARE PRIMARILY DETERMINED UNDER EITHER THE UNIT-OF-PRODUCTION METHOD OR THE

STRAIGHT-LINE METHOD. UNIT-OF-PRODUCTION RATES ARE BASED ON OIL, GAS AND OTHER MINERAL RESERVES ESTIMATED TO BE RECOVERABLE FROM EXISTING FACILITIES. THE STRAIGHT-LINE METHOD OF DEPRECIATION IS BASED ON ESTIMATED ASSET SERVICE LIFE TAKING

OBSOLESCENCE INTO CONSIDERATION.

MAINTENANCE AND

REPAIRS ARE EXPENSED AS INCURRED. MAJOR RENEWALS AND IMPROVEMENTS ARE CAPITALIZED AND THE ASSETS REPLACED ARE RETIRED.

THE CORPORATIONS UPSTREAM ACTIVITIES ARE ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER THE SUCCESSFUL EFFORTS METHOD. UNDER THIS METHOD, COSTS OF

PRODUCTIVE WELLS AND DEVELOPMENT DRY HOLES, BOTH TANGIBLE AND INTANGIBLE, AS WELL AS PRODUCTIVE ACREAGE ARE CAPITALIZED AND AMORTIZED ON THE UNIT-OF-PRODUCTION METHOD. COSTS OF THAT PORTION OF UNDEVELOPED ACREAGE LIKELY TO BE UNPRODUCTIVE, BASED

LARGELY ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE, ARE AMORTIZED OVER THE PERIOD OF EXPLORATION. OTHER EXPLORATORY EXPENDITURES, INCLUDING GEOPHYSICAL COSTS, OTHER DRY HOLE COSTS AND ANNUAL LEASE RENTALS, ARE EXPENSED AS INCURRED. EXPLORATORY WELLS THAT FIND OIL AND

GAS IN AN AREA REQUIRING A MAJOR CAPITAL EXPENDITURE BEFORE PRODUCTION CAN BEGIN ARE EVALUATED ANNUALLY TO ASSURE THAT COMMERCIAL QUANTITIES OF RESERVES HAVE BEEN FOUND OR THAT ADDITIONAL EXPLORATION WORK IS UNDER WAY OR PLANNED. EXPLORATORY WELL

COSTS NOT MEETING EITHER OF THESE TESTS ARE CHARGED TO EXPENSE.

OIL, GAS AND OTHER PROPERTIES HELD AND USED BY THE CORPORATION ARE REVIEWED FOR IMPAIRMENT WHENEVER EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THAT THE CARRYING AMOUNTS MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE. THE CORPORATION ESTIMATES THE FUTURE

UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS OF THE AFFECTED PROPERTIES TO JUDGE THE RECOVERABILITY OF CARRYING AMOUNTS. IN GENERAL, ANALYSES ARE BASED ON PROVED RESERVES, EXCEPT IN CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE IT IS PROBABLE THAT ADDITIONAL NON-PROVED RESERVES WILL BE DEVELOPED

AND CONTRIBUTE TO CASH FLOWS IN THE FUTURE.

SITE RESTORATION

AND ENVIRONMENTAL CONSERVATION COSTS.

SITE RESTORATION COSTS THAT MAY BE INCURRED BY THE CORPORATION AT THE END OF THE OPERATING LIFE OF CERTAIN OF ITS FACILITIES AND PROPERTIES ARE RESERVED RATABLY OVER THE ASSETS PRODUCTIVE LIFE.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

LIABILITIES FOR

ENVIRONMENTAL CONSERVATION ARE RECORDED WHEN IT IS PROBABLE THAT OBLIGATIONS HAVE BEEN INCURRED AND THE AMOUNTS CAN BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED. THESE LIABILITIES ARE NOT REDUCED BY POSSIBLE RECOVERIES FROM THIRD PARTIES, AND PROJECTED CASH EXPENDITURES

ARE NOT DISCOUNTED.

FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION.

THE

FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY FOR TRANSLATING THE ACCOUNTS OF THE MAJORITY OF DOWNSTREAM AND CHEMICAL OPERATIONS OUTSIDE THE U.S. IS THE LOCAL CURRENCY. LOCAL CURRENCY IS ALSO USED FOR UPSTREAM OPERATIONS THAT ARE RELATIVELY SELF-CONTAINED AND

INTEGRATED WITHIN A PARTICULAR COUNTRY, SUCH AS IN CANADA, THE UNITED KINGDOM, NORWAY AND CONTINENTAL EUROPE. THE U.S. DOLLAR IS USED FOR OPERATIONS IN HIGHLY INFLATIONARY ECONOMIES, IN SINGAPORE WHICH IS PREDOMINANTLY EXPORT ORIENTED AND FOR SOME

UPSTREAM OPERATIONS, PRIMARILY IN MALAYSIA, INDONESIA, ANGOLA, NIGERIA, EQUATORIAL GUINEA AND THE MIDDLE EAST COUNTRIES. FOR ALL OPERATIONS, GAINS OR LOSSES ON REMEASURING FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSACTIONS INTO FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY ARE INCLUDED IN

INCOME.

STOCK OPTION ACCOUNTING.

EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2003, THE CORPORATION WILL ADOPT FOR ALL EMPLOYEE STOCK-BASED AWARDS GRANTED AFTER THAT DATE, THE RECOGNITION PROVISIONS OF STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS NO. 123 (FAS 123), ACCOUNTING FOR STOCK-BASED

COMPENSATION. IN ACCORDANCE WITH FAS 123, COMPENSATION EXPENSE FOR FUTURE AWARDS WILL BE MEASURED BY THE FAIR VALUE OF THE AWARD AT THE DATE OF GRANT AND RECOGNIZED OVER THE VESTING PERIOD. THE FAIR VALUE OF AWARDS IN THE FORM OF RESTRICTED

STOCK IS THE MARKET PRICE OF THE STOCK. THE FAIR VALUE OF AWARDS IN THE FORM OF STOCK OPTIONS IS ESTIMATED USING AN OPTION-PRICING MODEL.

AS PERMITTED BY FAS 123, THE CORPORATION HAS RETAINED ITS PRIOR METHOD OF ACCOUNTING FOR STOCK-BASED AWARDS GRANTED BEFORE JANUARY 1,

2003. UNDER THIS METHOD, COMPENSATION EXPENSE FOR AWARDS GRANTED IN THE FORM OF STOCK OPTIONS IS MEASURED AT THE INTRINSIC VALUE OF THE OPTIONS (THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE MARKET PRICE OF STOCK AND THE EXERCISE PRICE OF THE OPTIONS) ON THE DATE OF

GRANT. SINCE THESE TWO PRICES ARE THE SAME ON THE DATE OF GRANT, NO COMPENSATION EXPENSE WAS RECOGNIZED IN INCOME FOR THESE AWARDS. ADDITIONALLY, COMPENSATION EXPENSE FOR AWARDS GRANTED IN THE FORM OF RESTRICTED STOCK IS BASED ON THE PRICE OF THE

STOCK WHEN IT IS GRANTED AND IS RECOGNIZED OVER THE VESTING PERIOD, WHICH IS THE SAME METHOD OF ACCOUNTING AS UNDER FAS 123.

IF THE PROVISIONS OF FAS 123 HAD BEEN ADOPTED FOR ALL PRIOR YEARS, THE IMPACT ON COMPENSATION EXPENSE, NET INCOME, AND NET INCOME PER

SHARE WOULD HAVE BEEN AS FOLLOWS.

THE PRO

FORMA AMOUNTS THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN REPORTED IF FAS 123 HAD BEEN IN EFFECT FOR ALL YEARS ARE BASED ON THE FAIR VALUE OF STOCK-BASED AWARDS GRANTED FOR EACH OF THOSE YEARS AND RECOGNIZED OVER THE VESTING PERIOD. IN 2002, THE STOCK-BASED AWARDS WERE IN

THE FORM OF RESTRICTED COMMON STOCK AND RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS, AND THE FAIR VALUE IS BASED ON THE PRICE OF THE STOCK AT THE DATE OF GRANT, WHICH WAS $34.64. NO STOCK OPTION AWARDS WERE MADE IN 2002. IN 2001 AND 2000, THE STOCK-BASED AWARDS WERE

PRIMARILY STOCK OPTIONS AND THE FAIR VALUES WERE ESTIMATED USING AN OPTION-PRICING MODEL. THE AVERAGE FAIR VALUE FOR EACH STOCK OPTION GRANTED DURING 2001 AND 2000 WAS $6.89 AND $10.18, RESPECTIVELY. THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE ASSUMPTIONS USED TO

DETERMINE THESE AMOUNTS FOR 2001 AND 2000, RESPECTIVELY, WERE: RISK-FREE INTEREST RATES OF 4.6 PERCENT AND 5.5 PERCENT; EXPECTED LIFE OF 6 YEARS AND VOLATILITY OF 16 PERCENT FOR BOTH YEARS; AND A DIVIDEND YIELD OF 2.5 PERCENT AND 2.0 PERCENT.

2. EXTRAORDINARY ITEM

NET INCOME FOR

2001 INCLUDED NET AFTER-TAX GAINS FROM ASSET MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES IN THE CHEMICALS SEGMENT AND REGULATORY REQUIRED ASSET DIVESTITURES IN THE AMOUNT OF $215 MILLION (INCLUDING AN INCOME TAX CREDIT OF $21 MILLION), OR $0.03 PER COMMON SHARE. NET

INCOME FOR 2000 INCLUDED NET AFTER-TAX GAINS FROM REGULATORY REQUIRED ASSET DIVESTITURES IN THE AMOUNT OF $1,730 MILLION (NET OF $308 MILLION OF INCOME TAXES), OR $0.25 PER COMMON SHARE. THESE NET AFTER-TAX GAINS WERE REPORTED AS EXTRAORDINARY ITEMS

ACCORDING TO ACCOUNTING REQUIREMENTS FOR BUSINESS COMBINATIONS ACCOUNTED FOR AS POOLING OF INTERESTS.

3. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS

IN 2002,

THE COPPER BUSINESS IN CHILE AND THE COAL OPERATIONS IN COLOMBIA WERE SOLD. EARNINGS OF THESE BUSINESSES ARE REPORTED AS DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS FOR ALL YEARS PRESENTED IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF INCOME. INCOME TAXES RELATED TO DISCONTINUED

OPERATIONS WERE: 2002  $41 MILLION, 2001  $47 MILLION AND 2000  $16 MILLION. INCLUDED IN DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS FOR 2002 ARE GAINS ON THE DISPOSITIONS OF $400 MILLION, NET OF TAX. THE ASSETS THAT WERE SOLD WERE PRIMARILY PROPERTY,

PLANT AND EQUIPMENT IN THE AMOUNT OF $1.3 BILLION. REVENUES OF THESE OPERATIONS WERE NOT MATERIAL. THESE BUSINESSES WERE HISTORICALLY REPORTED IN THE ALL OTHER COLUMN IN THE SEGMENT DISCLOSURES LOCATED IN NOTE 19 ON PAGES 58 AND 59.

4. MERGER EXPENSES AND REORGANIZATION RESERVES

ON NOVEMBER 30, 1999, A WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARY OF EXXON CORPORATION (EXXON) MERGED WITH MOBIL CORPORATION (MOBIL) SO THAT MOBIL BECAME A WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARY OF EXXON (THE MERGER). AT THE SAME TIME, EXXON CHANGED ITS

NAME TO EXXON MOBIL CORPORATION (EXXONMOBIL).

AS

A CONDITION OF THE APPROVAL OF THE MERGER, THE U.S. FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION AND THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION REQUIRED THAT CERTAIN PROPERTY  PRIMARILY DOWNSTREAM, PIPELINE AND NATURAL GAS DISTRIBUTION ASSETS  BE DIVESTED. THE CARRYING VALUE

OF THESE ASSETS WAS APPROXIMATELY $3 BILLION AND NET AFTER-TAX GAINS OF $40 MILLION AND $1,730 MILLION WERE REPORTED AS EXTRAORDINARY ITEMS IN 2001 AND 2000, RESPECTIVELY. THE DIVESTED PROPERTIES HISTORICALLY EARNED APPROXIMATELY $200 MILLION PER

YEAR.

IN ASSOCIATION WITH THE MERGER, $410

MILLION PRE-TAX ($275 MILLION AFTER-TAX), $748 MILLION PRE-TAX ($525 MILLION AFTER-TAX) AND $1,406 MILLION PRE-TAX ($920 MILLION AFTER-TAX) OF COSTS WERE RECORDED AS MERGER-RELATED EXPENSES IN 2002, 2001 AND 2000, RESPECTIVELY. CUMULATIVE CHARGES

FOR THE PERIOD 1999 TO 2002 OF $3,189 MILLION INCLUDED SEPARATION EXPENSES OF APPROXIMATELY $1,460 MILLION RELATED TO WORKFORCE REDUCTIONS (APPROXIMATELY 8,200 EMPLOYEES AT YEAR-END 2002), PLUS IMPLEMENTATION COSTS AND MERGER CLOSING COSTS.

REFLECTING THE COMPLETION OF MERGER-RELATED ACTIVITIES, MERGER EXPENSES WILL NOT BE REPORTED IN 2003.

THE SEPARATION RESERVE BALANCE AT YEAR-END 2002 OF APPROXIMATELY $101 MILLION IS EXPECTED TO BE EXPENDED IN 2003.

THE FOLLOWING TABLE SUMMARIZES THE ACTIVITY IN THE

REORGANIZATION RESERVES. THE 2000 OPENING BALANCE REPRESENTS ACCRUALS FOR PROVISIONS TAKEN IN PRIOR YEARS.

GAINS OF $159 MILLION, $238 MILLION AND $175 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE COMBINED EFFECTS OF LIFO INVENTORY ACCUMULATIONS AND DRAW-DOWNS. THE AGGREGATE REPLACEMENT COST OF INVENTORIES WAS ESTIMATED TO EXCEED THEIR LIFO CARRYING VALUES

BY $6.8 BILLION AND $4.2 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2002 AND 2001, RESPECTIVELY.

6. CASH FLOW INFORMATION

THE

CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS PROVIDES INFORMATION ABOUT CHANGES IN CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS. HIGHLY LIQUID INVESTMENTS WITH MATURITIES OF THREE MONTHS OR LESS WHEN ACQUIRED ARE CLASSIFIED AS CASH EQUIVALENTS.

IN 2002, THE ALL OTHER ITEMS  NET LINE IN

CASH FLOW FROM OPERATIONS INCLUDED $1.5 BILLION IN FUNDS RECEIVED FROM BEB ERDGAS UND ERDOEL GMBH (BEB), A GERMAN EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION COMPANY INDIRECTLY OWNED 50 PERCENT AND ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER THE EQUITY METHOD OF ACCOUNTING. THE

FUNDS WERE LOANED IN CONNECTION WITH A RESTRUCTURING THAT WILL ENABLE BEB TO TRANSFER ITS HOLDINGS IN RUHRGAS AG, A GERMAN GAS TRANSMISSION COMPANY. IT IS ANTICIPATED THAT NET INCOME WILL BE RECOGNIZED IN 2003 UPON FINALIZATION OF REGULATORY REVIEWS

AND COMPLETION OF THE TRANSFER OF THE RUHRGAS SHARES.

(A) EQUITY COMPANY

REVENUES FOR PRIOR YEARS HAVE BEEN ADJUSTED ON A COMPARABLE BASIS TO CONFORM TO THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD EMERGING ISSUES TASK FORCE CONSENSUS IN ISSUE NO. 02-3 REGARDING THE REPORTING OF REVENUES ON CERTAIN ENERGY CONTRACTS. THIS

CHANGE IN ACCOUNTING DOES NOT AFFECT NET INCOME.

IN JANUARY 2003, THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD ISSUED INTERPRETATION NO. 46 (FIN 46), CONSOLIDATION OF VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES, WHICH PROVIDES GUIDANCE ON WHEN CERTAIN ENTITIES SHOULD BE CONSOLIDATED OR THE

INTERESTS IN THOSE ENTITIES SHOULD BE DISCLOSED BY ENTERPRISES THAT DO NOT CONTROL THEM THROUGH MAJORITY VOTING INTEREST. UNDER FIN 46, ENTITIES ARE REQUIRED TO BE CONSOLIDATED BY ENTERPRISES THAT LACK MAJORITY VOTING INTEREST WHEN EQUITY INVESTORS

OF THOSE ENTITIES HAVE INSIGNIFICANT CAPITAL AT RISK OR THEY LACK VOTING RIGHTS, THE OBLIGATION TO ABSORB EXPECTED LOSSES, OR THE RIGHT TO RECEIVE EXPECTED RETURNS. ENTITIES IDENTIFIED WITH THESE CHARACTERISTICS ARE CALLED VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES

AND THE INTERESTS THAT ENTERPRISES HAVE IN THESE ENTITIES ARE CALLED VARIABLE INTERESTS. THESE INTERESTS CAN DERIVE FROM CERTAIN GUARANTEES, LEASES, LOANS, OR OTHER ARRANGEMENTS THAT RESULT IN RISKS AND REWARDS THAT ARE DISPROPORTIONATE TO THE

VOTING INTERESTS IN THE ENTITIES.

THE PROVISIONS

OF FIN 46 MUST BE IMMEDIATELY APPLIED FOR VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES CREATED AFTER JANUARY 31, 2003. FOR VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES CREATED BEFORE FEBRUARY 1, 2003, FIN 46 MUST BE ADOPTED IN THE FIRST REPORTING PERIOD BEGINNING AFTER JUNE 15, 2003.

IN ORDER TO COMPLY WITH THE PROVISIONS OF FIN

46, THE CORPORATION IS REVIEWING ITS FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS TO IDENTIFY ANY THAT MIGHT QUALIFY AS VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES. THERE IS A REASONABLE POSSIBILITY THAT CERTAIN JOINT VENTURES IN WHICH THE CORPORATION HAS AN INTEREST MIGHT BE VARIABLE

INTEREST ENTITIES. SUMMARIZED FINANCIAL DATA FOR THESE ENTITIES ARE A PART OF THE DATA IN THE ABOVE TABLES. THESE JOINT VENTURES ARE OPERATING ENTITIES AND THE OTHER EQUITY INVESTORS ARE THIRD PARTIES INDEPENDENT FROM THE CORPORATION. THE

CORPORATIONS SHARE OF NET INCOME OF THESE ENTITIES IS INCLUDED IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF INCOME. THE VARIABLE INTERESTS ARISE PRIMARILY BECAUSE OF CERTAIN GUARANTEES EXTENDED BY THE CORPORATION TO THE JOINT VENTURES, WHICH ARE INCLUDED

IN THE DISCLOSURE OF GUARANTEES INCLUDED IN NOTE 17 ON PAGE 56.

THE CORPORATION DOES NOT EXPECT ANY IMPACT ON NET INCOME IF IT IS REQUIRED TO CONSOLIDATE ANY OF THESE POSSIBLE VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES BECAUSE IT ALREADY IS RECORDING ITS SHARE OF NET INCOME OF THESE ENTITIES. THE IMPACT TO THE

BALANCE SHEET WOULD BE AN INCREASE IN ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ESTIMATED TO BE LESS THAN 1 PERCENT OF TOTAL ASSETS. HOWEVER, THERE WOULD BE NO CHANGE TO THE CALCULATION OF RETURN ON AVERAGE CAPITAL EMPLOYED BECAUSE THE CORPORATION ALREADY INCLUDES ITS

SHARE OF JOINT VENTURE DEBT IN THE DETERMINATION OF AVERAGE CAPITAL EMPLOYED.

12. EMPLOYEE STOCK OWNERSHIP PLANS

IN 1989, THE EXXON AND MOBIL EMPLOYEE STOCK OWNERSHIP PLAN TRUSTS BORROWED $1,000 MILLION AND $800 MILLION RESPECTIVELY TO FINANCE THE PURCHASE OF SHARES OF EXXON AND MOBIL STOCK. THE TRUSTS WERE MERGED IN LATE 1999 TO CREATE THE

EXXONMOBIL LEVERAGED EMPLOYEE STOCK OWNERSHIP TRUST (EXXONMOBIL LESOP). THE EXXONMOBIL LESOP IS A CONSTITUENT PART OF THE EXXONMOBIL SAVINGS PLAN, WHICH, EFFECTIVE FEBRUARY 8, 2002, IS AN EMPLOYEE STOCK OWNERSHIP PLAN IN ITS ENTIRETY.

EMPLOYEES ELIGIBLE TO PARTICIPATE IN THE EXXONMOBIL SAVINGS

PLAN MAY ELECT TO PARTICIPATE IN THE EXXONMOBIL LESOP. CORPORATE CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE PLAN AND DIVIDENDS ARE USED TO MAKE PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST PAYMENTS ON THE REMAINING EXXONMOBIL LESOP NOTES ($65 MILLION OUTSTANDING AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2002, WHICH

WILL BE FULLY REPAID IN 2003). AS CORPORATE CONTRIBUTIONS AND DIVIDENDS ARE CREDITED, COMMON SHARES ARE ALLOCATED TO PARTICIPANTS PLAN ACCOUNTS. THE CORPORATIONS CONTRIBUTION TO THE EXXONMOBIL LESOP, REPRESENTING THE AMOUNT BY WHICH DEBT

SERVICE EXCEEDED DIVIDENDS ON SHARES HELD BY THE EXXONMOBIL LESOP, WAS $86 MILLION, $58 MILLION AND $15 MILLION IN 2002, 2001 AND 2000, RESPECTIVELY.

ACCOUNTING FOR THE PLANS HAS FOLLOWED THE PRINCIPLES THAT WERE IN EFFECT FOR THE RESPECTIVE PLANS WHEN THEY WERE ESTABLISHED. THE AMOUNT

OF COMPENSATION EXPENSE RELATED TO THE PLANS AND RECORDED BY THE CORPORATION DURING THE PERIODS WAS $122 MILLION IN 2002, $83 MILLION IN 2001 AND $13 MILLION IN 2000. THE EXXONMOBIL LESOP TRUST HELD 98 MILLION SHARES OF EXXONMOBIL COMMON STOCK AT

THE END OF 2002 AND 104.2 MILLION SHARES AT THE END OF 2001.

ON MAY 30, 2001, THE

COMPANYS BOARD OF DIRECTORS APPROVED A TWO-FOR-ONE STOCK SPLIT OF COMMON STOCK FOR SHAREHOLDERS OF RECORD ON JUNE 20, 2001. THE AUTHORIZED COMMON STOCK WAS INCREASED FROM 4.5 BILLION SHARES WITHOUT PAR VALUE TO 9 BILLION SHARES WITHOUT PAR

VALUE, AND THE ISSUED SHARES WERE SPLIT ON A TWO-FOR-ONE BASIS ON JUNE 20, 2001.

IN 1989, $1,800 MILLION OF BENEFIT RELATED BALANCES WERE RECORDED AS DEBT AND AS A REDUCTION TO SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY, REPRESENTING EXXON AND MOBIL GUARANTEED BORROWINGS BY THE EXXON LESOP TO

PURCHASE EXXON CLASS A PREFERRED STOCK AND THE MOBIL LESOP TO PURCHASE MOBIL CLASS B PREFERRED STOCK. ALL PREFERRED SHARES WERE CONVERTED TO EXXONMOBIL COMMON STOCK BY YEAR-END 1999. AS COMMON SHARES ARE EARNED BY EMPLOYEES AND THE DEBT IS REPAID,

THE BENEFIT PLAN RELATED BALANCES ARE BEING REDUCED.

14. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND DERIVATIVES

THE FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS IS DETERMINED BY REFERENCE TO VARIOUS MARKET DATA AND OTHER VALUATION TECHNIQUES AS APPROPRIATE. LONG-TERM DEBT IS THE ONLY CATEGORY OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WHOSE FAIR VALUE DIFFERS MATERIALLY

FROM THE RECORDED BOOK VALUE. THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF TOTAL LONG-TERM DEBT, INCLUDING CAPITALIZED LEASE OBLIGATIONS, AT DECEMBER 31, 2002 AND 2001, WAS $7.8 BILLION AND $7.9 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY, AS COMPARED TO RECORDED BOOK VALUES OF $6.7

BILLION AND $7.1 BILLION.

THE CORPORATIONS

SIZE, GEOGRAPHIC DIVERSITY AND THE COMPLEMENTARY NATURE OF THE UPSTREAM, DOWNSTREAM AND CHEMICALS BUSINESSES MITIGATE THE CORPORATIONS RISK FROM CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES, CURRENCY RATES AND COMMODITY PRICES. THE CORPORATION RELIES ON THESE

OPERATING ATTRIBUTES AND STRENGTHS TO REDUCE ENTERPRISE-WIDE RISK. AS A RESULT, THE CORPORATION MAKES LIMITED USE OF DERIVATIVES TO OFFSET EXPOSURES ARISING FROM EXISTING TRANSACTIONS.

THE CORPORATION DOES NOT TRADE IN DERIVATIVES NOR DOES IT USE DERIVATIVES WITH LEVERAGED FEATURES. THE

CORPORATION MAINTAINS A SYSTEM OF CONTROLS THAT INCLUDES A POLICY COVERING THE AUTHORIZATION, REPORTING AND MONITORING OF DERIVATIVE ACTIVITY. THE CORPORATIONS DERIVATIVE ACTIVITIES POSE NO MATERIAL CREDIT OR MARKET RISKS TO EXXONMOBILS

OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL CONDITION OR LIQUIDITY. INTEREST RATE, FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATE AND COMMODITY PRICE EXPOSURES ARISING FROM DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS UNDERTAKEN IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE CORPORATIONS POLICIES HAVE NOT BEEN SIGNIFICANT.

THE FAIR VALUE OF DERIVATIVES OUTSTANDING AND RECORDED ON THE

BALANCE SHEET WAS A NET RECEIVABLE OF $20 MILLION AND A NET PAYABLE OF $50 MILLION AT YEAR-END 2002 AND 2001, RESPECTIVELY. THIS IS THE AMOUNT THAT THE CORPORATION WOULD HAVE RECEIVED OR PAID TO THIRD PARTIES IF THESE DERIVATIVES HAD BEEN SETTLED.

THESE DERIVATIVE FAIR VALUES WERE SUBSTANTIALLY OFFSET BY THE FAIR VALUES OF THE UNDERLYING EXPOSURES BEING HEDGED. THE CORPORATION RECOGNIZED A LOSS OF $35 MILLION AND A GAIN OF $23 MILLION RELATED TO DERIVATIVE ACTIVITY DURING 2002 AND 2001,

RESPECTIVELY. THE LOSSES/GAINS INCLUDED THE OFFSETTING AMOUNTS FROM THE CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE OF THE ITEMS BEING HEDGED BY THE DERIVATIVES.

15. LONG-TERM DEBT

AT DECEMBER 31,

2002, LONG-TERM DEBT CONSISTED OF $5,985 MILLION DUE IN U.S. DOLLARS AND $670 MILLION REPRESENTING THE U.S. DOLLAR EQUIVALENT AT YEAR-END EXCHANGE RATES OF AMOUNTS PAYABLE IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES. THESE AMOUNTS EXCLUDE THAT PORTION OF LONG-TERM DEBT,

TOTALING $884 MILLION, WHICH MATURES WITHIN ONE YEAR AND IS INCLUDED IN CURRENT LIABILITIES. THE AMOUNTS OF LONG-TERM DEBT MATURING, TOGETHER WITH SINKING FUND PAYMENTS REQUIRED, IN EACH OF THE FOUR YEARS AFTER DECEMBER 31, 2003, IN MILLIONS OF

DOLLARS, ARE: 2004  $2,499, 2005  $345, 2006  $132 AND 2007 $89. CERTAIN OF THE BORROWINGS DESCRIBED MAY FROM TIME TO TIME BE ASSIGNED TO OTHER EXXONMOBIL AFFILIATES. AT DECEMBER 31, 2002, THE CORPORATIONS UNUSED

LONG-TERM CREDIT LINES WERE NOT MATERIAL.

THE

TOTAL OUTSTANDING BALANCE OF DEFEASED DEBT AT YEAR-END 2002 WAS $196 MILLION. SUMMARIZED LONG-TERM BORROWINGS AT YEAR-END 2002 AND 2001 WERE AS SHOWN IN THE ADJACENT TABLE.

17. LITIGATION AND OTHER CONTINGENCIES

A NUMBER OF LAWSUITS, INCLUDING CLASS ACTIONS, WERE BROUGHT IN VARIOUS COURTS AGAINST EXXON MOBIL CORPORATION AND CERTAIN OF ITS SUBSIDIARIES RELATING TO THE ACCIDENTAL RELEASE OF CRUDE OIL FROM THE TANKER EXXON VALDEZ IN 1989. THE

VAST MAJORITY OF THE CLAIMS HAVE BEEN RESOLVED LEAVING A FEW COMPENSATORY DAMAGES CASES TO BE RESOLVED. ALL OF THE PUNITIVE DAMAGE CLAIMS WERE CONSOLIDATED IN THE CIVIL TRIAL THAT BEGAN IN MAY 1994.

IN THAT TRIAL, ON SEPTEMBER 24, 1996, THE UNITED STATES

DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF ALASKA ENTERED A JUDGMENT IN THE AMOUNT OF $5 BILLION IN PUNITIVE DAMAGES TO A CLASS COMPOSED OF ALL PERSONS AND ENTITIES WHO ASSERTED CLAIMS FOR PUNITIVE DAMAGES FROM THE CORPORATION AS A RESULT OF THE EXXON

VALDEZ GROUNDING. EXXONMOBIL APPEALED THE JUDGMENT. ON NOVEMBER 7, 2001, THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT VACATED THE PUNITIVE DAMAGE AWARD AS BEING EXCESSIVE UNDER THE CONSTITUTION AND REMANDED THE CASE TO THE DISTRICT COURT

FOR IT TO DETERMINE THE AMOUNT OF THE PUNITIVE DAMAGE AWARD CONSISTENT WITH THE NINTH CIRCUITS HOLDING. ON DECEMBER 6, 2002, THE DISTRICT COURT REDUCED THE PUNITIVE DAMAGES AWARD FROM $5 BILLION TO $4 BILLION. THIS CASE WILL RETURN TO THE

NINTH CIRCUIT FOR ITS DETERMINATION. THE CORPORATION HAS POSTED A $4.8 BILLION LETTER OF CREDIT.

ON JANUARY 29, 1997, A SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT WAS CONCLUDED RESOLVING ALL REMAINING MATTERS BETWEEN THE CORPORATION AND VARIOUS INSURERS ARISING FROM THE VALDEZ ACCIDENT. UNDER TERMS OF THIS SETTLEMENT,

EXXONMOBIL RECEIVED $480 MILLION. FINAL INCOME STATEMENT RECOGNITION OF THIS SETTLEMENT CONTINUES TO BE DEFERRED IN VIEW OF UNCERTAINTY REGARDING THE ULTIMATE COST TO THE CORPORATION OF THE VALDEZ ACCIDENT.

THE ULTIMATE COST TO EXXONMOBIL FROM THE LAWSUITS ARISING FROM

THE EXXON VALDEZ GROUNDING IS NOT POSSIBLE TO PREDICT AND MAY NOT BE RESOLVED FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS.

A DISPUTE WITH A DUTCH AFFILIATE CONCERNING AN OVERLIFT OF NATURAL GAS BY A GERMAN AFFILIATE WAS RESOLVED BY PAYMENTS BY THE GERMAN

AFFILIATE PURSUANT TO AN ARBITRATION AWARD. THE GERMAN AFFILIATE HAD PAID ROYALTIES ON THE EXCESS GAS AND RECOVERED THE ROYALTIES IN 2001. THE ONLY SUBSTANTIVE ISSUE REMAINING IS THE TAXES PAYABLE ON THE FINAL COMPENSATION FOR THE OVERLIFT.

RESOLUTION OF THIS ISSUE WILL NOT HAVE A MATERIALLY ADVERSE EFFECT UPON THE CORPORATIONS OPERATIONS OR FINANCIAL CONDITION.

ON DECEMBER 19, 2000, A JURY IN MONTGOMERY COUNTY, ALABAMA, RETURNED A VERDICT AGAINST THE CORPORATION IN A CONTRACT DISPUTE OVER

ROYALTIES IN THE AMOUNT OF $87.69 MILLION IN COMPENSATORY DAMAGES AND $3.42 BILLION IN PUNITIVE DAMAGES IN THE CASE OF EXXON CORPORATION V. STATE OF ALABAMA, ET AL. THE VERDICT WAS UPHELD BY THE TRIAL COURT ON MAY 4, 2001. ON DECEMBER 20, 2002, THE

ALABAMA SUPREME COURT VACATED THE $3.5 BILLION JURY VERDICT. THE DECISION SENDS THE CASE BACK TO A LOWER COURT FOR A NEW TRIAL. THE ULTIMATE OUTCOME IS NOT EXPECTED TO HAVE A MATERIALLY ADVERSE EFFECT UPON THE CORPORATIONS OPERATIONS OR

FINANCIAL CONDITION.

ON MAY 22, 2001, A STATE

COURT JURY IN NEW ORLEANS, LOUISIANA, RETURNED A VERDICT AGAINST THE CORPORATION AND THREE OTHER ENTITIES IN A CASE BROUGHT BY A LANDOWNER CLAIMING DAMAGE TO HIS PROPERTY. THE PROPERTY HAD BEEN LEASED BY THE LANDOWNER TO A COMPANY THAT PERFORMED

PIPE CLEANING AND STORAGE SERVICES FOR CUSTOMERS, INCLUDING THE CORPORATION. THE JURY AWARDED THE PLAINTIFF $56 MILLION IN COMPENSATORY DAMAGES (90 PERCENT TO BE PAID BY THE CORPORATION) AND $1 BILLION IN PUNITIVE DAMAGES (ALL TO BE PAID BY THE

CORPORATION). THE DAMAGE RELATED TO THE PRESENCE OF NATURALLY OCCURRING RADIOACTIVE MATERIAL (NORM) ON THE SITE RESULTING FROM PIPE CLEANING OPERATIONS. THE AWARD HAS BEEN UPHELD AT THE TRIAL COURT. EXXONMOBIL HAS APPEALED THE JUDGMENT TO THE

LOUISIANA FOURTH CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS AND BELIEVES THAT THE JUDGMENT SHOULD BE SET ASIDE OR SUBSTANTIALLY REDUCED ON FACTUAL AND CONSTITUTIONAL GROUNDS. THE ULTIMATE OUTCOME IS NOT EXPECTED TO HAVE A MATERIALLY ADVERSE EFFECT UPON THE

CORPORATIONS OPERATIONS OR FINANCIAL CONDITION.

THE U.S. TAX COURT HAS DECIDED THE ISSUE WITH RESPECT TO THE PRICING OF CRUDE OIL PURCHASED FROM SAUDI ARABIA FOR THE YEARS 1979-1981 IN FAVOR OF THE CORPORATION. THIS DECISION IS SUBJECT TO APPEAL. CERTAIN OTHER ISSUES FOR THE YEARS

1979-1993 REMAIN PENDING BEFORE THE TAX COURT. THE ULTIMATE RESOLUTION OF THESE ISSUES IS NOT EXPECTED TO HAVE A MATERIALLY ADVERSE EFFECT UPON THE CORPORATIONS OPERATIONS OR FINANCIAL CONDITION.

CLAIMS FOR SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNTS HAVE BEEN MADE AGAINST

EXXONMOBIL AND CERTAIN OF ITS CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES IN OTHER PENDING LAWSUITS, THE OUTCOME OF WHICH IS NOT EXPECTED TO HAVE A MATERIALLY ADVERSE EFFECT UPON THE CORPORATIONS OPERATIONS OR FINANCIAL CONDITION.

THE CORPORATION AND CERTAIN OF ITS CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES

WERE CONTINGENTLY LIABLE AT DECEMBER 31, 2002, FOR $3,038 MILLION, PRIMARILY RELATING TO GUARANTEES FOR NOTES, LOANS AND PERFORMANCE UNDER CONTRACTS. THIS INCLUDED $986 MILLION REPRESENTING GUARANTEES OF NON-U.S. EXCISE TAXES AND CUSTOMS DUTIES OF

OTHER COMPANIES, ENTERED INTO AS A NORMAL BUSINESS PRACTICE, UNDER RECIPROCAL ARRANGEMENTS. ALSO INCLUDED IN THIS AMOUNT WERE GUARANTEES BY CONSOLIDATED AFFILIATES OF $1,621 MILLION, REPRESENTING EXXONMOBILS SHARE OF OBLIGATIONS OF CERTAIN

EQUITY COMPANIES.

ADDITIONALLY, THE CORPORATION AND ITS AFFILIATES HAVE NUMEROUS LONG-TERM SALES AND PURCHASE COMMITMENTS IN THEIR VARIOUS BUSINESS ACTIVITIES, ALL OF WHICH ARE EXPECTED TO BE FULFILLED

WITH NO ADVERSE CONSEQUENCES MATERIAL TO THE CORPORATIONS OPERATIONS OR FINANCIAL CONDITION. THE PRESENT VALUE OF UNCONDITIONAL PURCHASE OBLIGATIONS WAS $2,463 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2002. ON AN UNDISCOUNTED BASIS, INCLUDING IMPUTED INTEREST

OF $1,186 MILLION, THESE COMMITMENTS TOTALED $3,649 MILLION. UNCONDITIONAL PURCHASE OBLIGATIONS AS DEFINED BY ACCOUNTING STANDARDS ARE THOSE LONG-TERM COMMITMENTS THAT ARE NONCANCELABLE OR CANCELABLE ONLY UNDER CERTAIN CONDITIONS, AND THAT THIRD

PARTIES HAVE USED TO SECURE FINANCING FOR THE FACILITIES THAT WILL PROVIDE THE CONTRACTED GOODS OR SERVICES.

THE OPERATIONS AND EARNINGS OF THE CORPORATION AND ITS AFFILIATES THROUGHOUT THE WORLD HAVE BEEN, AND MAY IN THE FUTURE BE, AFFECTED FROM

TIME TO TIME IN VARYING DEGREE BY POLITICAL DEVELOPMENTS AND LAWS AND REGULATIONS, SUCH AS FORCED DIVESTITURE OF ASSETS; RESTRICTIONS ON PRODUCTION, IMPORTS AND EXPORTS; PRICE CONTROLS; TAX INCREASES AND RETROACTIVE TAX CLAIMS; EXPROPRIATION OF

PROPERTY; CANCELLATION OF CONTRACT RIGHTS AND ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS. BOTH THE LIKELIHOOD OF SUCH OCCURRENCES AND THEIR OVERALL EFFECT UPON THE CORPORATION VARY GREATLY FROM COUNTRY TO COUNTRY AND ARE NOT PREDICTABLE.

AS A RESULT OF LOSSES ON

PLAN ASSETS DRIVEN BY THE DOWNTURN IN WORLDWIDE EQUITY MARKETS AND DECREASES IN THE DISCOUNT RATE USED TO VALUE THE PENSION LIABILITY, INCREASES TO THE ADDITIONAL MINIMUM PENSION LIABILITY ADJUSTMENT RESULTED IN AFTER-TAX CHARGES OF $2,425 MILLION

AND $225 MILLION TO THE ACCUMULATED OTHER NONOWNER CHANGES IN EQUITY ACCOUNT INCLUDED IN SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET IN 2002 AND 2001, RESPECTIVELY. THIS ADJUSTMENT IS REQUIRED SO THAT THE

PENSION LIABILITY RECORDED ON THE CORPORATIONS BOOKS IS AT LEAST EQUAL TO THE UNFUNDED ACCUMULATED BENEFIT OBLIGATION FOR EACH PENSION PLAN.

THE DATA ON THE PRECEDING PAGE CONFORM WITH CURRENT ACCOUNTING STANDARDS THAT SPECIFY USE OF A DISCOUNT RATE AT WHICH POSTRETIREMENT

LIABILITIES COULD BE EFFECTIVELY SETTLED. THE DISCOUNT RATE FOR CALCULATING YEAR-END POSTRETIREMENT LIABILITIES IS BASED ON THE YEAR-END RATE OF INTEREST ON HIGH QUALITY BONDS. THE RETURN ON THE ANNUITY FUNDS ACTUAL PORTFOLIO OF ASSETS HAS

HISTORICALLY BEEN HIGHER THAN BONDS AS THE MAJORITY OF PENSION ASSETS ARE INVESTED IN EQUITIES. THE EXPECTED U.S. EARNINGS RATE OF 9.5 PER CENT USED IN 2002 COMPARES TO AN ACTUAL RATE EARNED IN THE U.S. OVER THE PAST DECADE OF 10 PERCENT. BASED ON

THE MOST RECENT FORWARD-LOOKING ANALYSIS, AN EXPECTED EARNINGS RATE OF 9.0 PERCENT WILL BE USED FOR THE U.S. PLANS IN 2003.

ALL FUNDED U.S. PLANS ARE FULLY FUNDED IN 2002 UNDER THE STANDARDS SET BY THE DEPARTMENT OF LABOR AND THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE. THE

CORPORATION WILL CONTINUE TO MAKE CONTRIBUTIONS AS NECESSARY TO MAINTAIN THE FULLY FUNDED STATUS OF THESE PLANS ACCORDING TO THOSE STANDARDS. CONTRIBUTIONS TO U.S. PLANS TOTALED $460 MILLION IN 2002 AND CONTRIBUTIONS TO NON-U.S. PLANS TOTALED $509

MILLION. CERTAIN SMALLER U.S. PLANS AND A NUMBER OF NON-U.S. PLANS ARE NOT FUNDED BECAUSE LOCAL TAX CONVENTIONS AND REGULATORY PRACTICES DO NOT ENCOURAGE FUNDING OF THESE PLANS. BOOK RESERVES HAVE BEEN ESTABLISHED FOR THESE PLANS TO PROVIDE FOR

FUTURE BENEFIT PAYMENTS. ALL DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION OBLIGATIONS, REGARDLESS OF THE FUNDING STATUS OF THE UNDERLYING PLANS, ARE FULLY SUPPORTED BY THE FINANCIAL STRENGTH OF THE CORPORATION OR THE RESPECTIVE SPONSORING AFFILIATE.

19. DISCLOSURES ABOUT SEGMENTS AND RELATED INFORMATION

THE FUNCTIONAL SEGMENTATION OF OPERATIONS REFLECTED ON PAGE 59 IS CONSISTENT WITH EXXONMOBILS INTERNAL REPORTING. EARNINGS INCLUDE SPECIAL ITEMS AND TRANSFERS ARE AT ESTIMATED MARKET PRICES. CONSISTENT WITH A CHANGE IN

INTERNAL ORGANIZATION IN 2002, EARNINGS FROM THE ELECTRIC POWER BUSINESS, PREVIOUSLY REPORTED IN THE OTHER SEGMENT, ARE NOW SHOWN WITHIN NON-U.S. UPSTREAM. EARNINGS FROM THE DIVESTED COAL AND MINERALS BUSINESSES ARE SHOWN AS DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS

AND ARE INCLUDED WITHIN THE OTHER SEGMENT. CORRESPONDING ITEMS OF SEGMENT INFORMATION HAVE BEEN REVISED FOR ALL EARLIER PERIODS SHOWN ON PAGE 59. IN ADDITION TO DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS, THE OTHER SEGMENT INCLUDES CORPORATE AND FINANCING ACTIVITIES,

MERGER EXPENSES AND EXTRAORDINARY GAINS FROM REQUIRED ASSET DIVESTITURES. THE INTEREST REVENUE AMOUNT RELATES TO INTEREST EARNED ON CASH DEPOSITS AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES. INTEREST EXPENSE INCLUDES NON-DEBT RELATED INTEREST EXPENSE OF $207 MILLION,

$105 MILLION AND $142 MILLION IN 2002, 2001 AND 2000, RESPECTIVELY. NON-U.S. UPSTREAM AFTER-TAX EARNINGS IN 2002 INCLUDE A SPECIAL CHARGE OF $215 MILLION REFLECTING THE IMPACT ON DEFERRED TAXES FROM THE 10 PERCENT SUPPLEMENTARY TAX ENACTED IN THE

UNITED KINGDOM IN JULY 2002.

OIL

AND GAS RESERVES

THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION DESCRIBES

CHANGES DURING THE YEARS AND BALANCES OF PROVED OIL AND GAS RESERVES AT YEAR-END 2000, 2001 AND 2002.

THE DEFINITIONS USED ARE IN ACCORDANCE WITH APPLICABLE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION REGULATIONS.

PROVED OIL AND GAS RESERVES ARE THE ESTIMATED QUANTITIES OF

CRUDE OIL, NATURAL GAS AND NATURAL GAS LIQUIDS WHICH GEOLOGICAL AND ENGINEERING DATA DEMONSTRATE WITH REASONABLE CERTAINTY TO BE RECOVERABLE IN FUTURE YEARS FROM KNOWN RESERVOIRS UNDER EXISTING ECONOMIC AND OPERATING CONDITIONS, I.E., PRICES AND

COSTS AS OF THE DATE THE ESTIMATE IS MADE. PRICES INCLUDE CONSIDERATION OF CHANGES IN EXISTING PRICES PROVIDED ONLY BY CONTRACTUAL ARRANGEMENTS, BUT NOT ON ESCALATIONS BASED UPON FUTURE CONDITIONS. IN SOME CASES, SUBSTANTIAL NEW INVESTMENTS IN

ADDITIONAL WELLS AND RELATED FACILITIES WILL BE REQUIRED TO RECOVER THESE PROVED RESERVES. IN CERTAIN DEEPWATER FIELDS, PROVED RESERVES ARE OCCASIONALLY RECORDED BEFORE FLOW TESTS ARE CONDUCTED BECAUSE OF THE SAFETY AND COST IMPLICATIONS OF

CONDUCTING THE TESTS. IN THOSE SITUATIONS, OTHER INDUSTRY ACCEPTED ANALYSES ARE USED. HISTORICALLY, PROVED RESERVES RECORDED USING THESE METHODS HAVE BEEN IMMATERIAL WHEN COMPARED TO THE CORPORATIONS TOTAL PROVED RESERVES AND HAVE ALSO BEEN

VALIDATED BY SUBSEQUENT FLOW TESTS OR ACTUAL PRODUCTION LEVELS.

PROVED RESERVES INCLUDE 100 PERCENT OF EACH MAJORITY OWNED AFFILIATES PARTICIPATION IN PROVED RESERVES AND EXXONMOBILS OWNERSHIP PERCENTAGE OF THE PROVED RESERVES OF EQUITY COMPANIES, BUT EXCLUDE ROYALTIES AND QUANTITIES

DUE OTHERS. GAS RESERVES EXCLUDE THE GASEOUS EQUIVALENT OF LIQUIDS EXPECTED TO BE REMOVED FROM THE GAS ON LEASES, AT FIELD FACILITIES AND AT GAS PROCESSING PLANTS. THESE LIQUIDS ARE INCLUDED IN NET PROVED RESERVES OF CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS

LIQUIDS.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

NET PROVED

DEVELOPED RESERVES ARE THOSE VOLUMES WHICH ARE EXPECTED TO BE RECOVERED THROUGH EXISTING WELLS WITH EXISTING EQUIPMENT AND OPERATING METHODS. UNDEVELOPED RESERVES ARE THOSE VOLUMES WHICH ARE EXPECTED TO BE RECOVERED AS A RESULT OF FUTURE INVESTMENTS

TO DRILL NEW WELLS, TO RECOMPLETE EXISTING WELLS AND/OR TO INSTALL FACILITIES TO COLLECT AND DELIVER THE PRODUCTION FROM EXISTING AND FUTURE WELLS.

RESERVES ATTRIBUTABLE TO CERTAIN OIL AND GAS DISCOVERIES WERE NOT CONSIDERED PROVED AS OF YEAR-END 2002 DUE TO GEOLOGICAL, TECHNOLOGICAL

OR ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTIES AND THEREFORE ARE NOT INCLUDED IN THE TABULATION.

CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS LIQUIDS AND NATURAL GAS PRODUCTION QUANTITIES SHOWN ARE THE NET VOLUMES WITHDRAWN FROM EXXONMOBILS OIL AND GAS RESERVES. THE NATURAL GAS QUANTITIES DIFFER FROM THE

QUANTITIES OF GAS DELIVERED FOR SALE BY THE PRODUCING FUNCTION AS REPORTED ON PAGE 67 DUE TO VOLUMES CONSUMED OR FLARED AND INVENTORY CHANGES. SUCH QUANTITIES AMOUNTED TO APPROXIMATELY 392 BILLION CUBIC FEET IN 2000, 406 BILLION CUBIC FEET IN 2001

AND 420 BILLION CUBIC FEET IN 2002.

INFORMATION ON CANADIAN TAR SANDS PROVEN RESERVES NOT INCLUDED ABOVE

IN ADDITION TO CONVENTIONAL LIQUIDS AND NATURAL GAS PROVED RESERVES,

EXXONMOBIL HAS SIGNIFICANT INTERESTS IN PROVEN TAR SANDS RESERVES IN CANADA ASSOCIATED WITH THE SYNCRUDE PROJECT. FOR INTERNAL MANAGEMENT PURPOSES, EXXONMOBIL VIEWS THESE RESERVES AND THEIR DEVELOPMENT AS AN INTEGRAL PART OF TOTAL UPSTREAM

OPERATIONS. HOWEVER, U.S. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION REGULATIONS DEFINE THESE RESERVES AS MINING RELATED AND NOT A PART OF CONVENTIONAL OIL AND GAS RESERVES.

THE TAR SANDS RESERVES ARE NOT CONSIDERED IN THE STANDARDIZED MEASURE OF DISCOUNTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS FOR

CONVENTIONAL OIL AND GAS RESERVES, WHICH IS FOUND ON PAGE 66.

STANDARDIZED MEASURE OF DISCOUNTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS

AS REQUIRED BY THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD, THE STANDARDIZED MEASURE OF DISCOUNTED FUTURE NET CASH FLOWS IS COMPUTED BY APPLYING YEAR-END PRICES, COSTS AND LEGISLATED TAX RATES AND A DISCOUNT FACTOR OF 10 PERCENT TO NET

PROVED RESERVES. THE CORPORATION BELIEVES THE STANDARDIZED MEASURE IS NOT MEANINGFUL AND MAY BE MISLEADING, DUE TO A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING SIGNIFICANT VARIABILITY IN CASH FLOWS DUE TO CHANGES IN YEAR-END PRICES.
