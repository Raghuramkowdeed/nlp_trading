PART I

ITEM 1.  BUSINESS.

EXXON MOBIL CORPORATION ("EXXONMOBIL"), FORMERLY NAMED EXXON CORPORATION,

WAS INCORPORATED IN THE STATE OF NEW JERSEY IN 1882. ON NOVEMBER 30, 1999,

MOBIL CORPORATION ("MOBIL") BECAME A WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARY OF EXXON

CORPORATION ("EXXON") AND EXXON CHANGED ITS NAME TO EXXON MOBIL CORPORATION.

DIVISIONS AND AFFILIATED COMPANIES OF EXXONMOBIL OPERATE OR MARKET PRODUCTS

IN THE UNITED STATES AND ABOUT 200 OTHER COUNTRIES AND TERRITORIES. THEIR

PRINCIPAL BUSINESS IS ENERGY, INVOLVING EXPLORATION FOR, AND PRODUCTION OF,

CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS, MANUFACTURE OF PETROLEUM PRODUCTS AND TRANSPORTATION

AND SALE OF CRUDE OIL, NATURAL GAS AND PETROLEUM PRODUCTS. EXXONMOBIL IS A

MAJOR MANUFACTURER AND MARKETER OF BASIC PETROCHEMICALS, INCLUDING OLEFINS,

AROMATICS, POLYETHYLENE AND POLYPROPYLENE PLASTICS AND A WIDE VARIETY OF

SPECIALTY PRODUCTS. EXXONMOBIL IS ENGAGED IN EXPLORATION FOR, AND MINING AND

SALE OF COAL, COPPER AND OTHER MINERALS. EXXONMOBIL ALSO HAS INTERESTS IN

ELECTRIC POWER GENERATION FACILITIES. AFFILIATES OF EXXONMOBIL CONDUCT

EXTENSIVE RESEARCH PROGRAMS IN SUPPORT OF THESE BUSINESSES.

EXXON MOBIL CORPORATION HAS SEVERAL DIVISIONS AND HUNDREDS OF AFFILIATES,

MANY WITH NAMES THAT INCLUDE EXXONMOBIL, EXXON, ESSO OR MOBIL. FOR CONVENIENCE

AND SIMPLICITY, IN THIS REPORT THE TERMS EXXONMOBIL, EXXON, ESSO AND MOBIL, AS

WELL AS TERMS LIKE CORPORATION, COMPANY, OUR, WE AND ITS, ARE SOMETIMES USED AS

ABBREVIATED REFERENCES TO SPECIFIC AFFILIATES OR GROUPS OF AFFILIATES. THE

PRECISE MEANING DEPENDS ON THE CONTEXT IN QUESTION.

IN 2001, THE CORPORATION SPENT $1,782 MILLION (OF WHICH $505 MILLION WERE

CAPITAL EXPENDITURES) ON ENVIRONMENTAL PROJECTS AND EXPENSES WORLDWIDE, MOSTLY

DEALING WITH AIR AND WATER CONSERVATION. TOTAL EXPENDITURES FOR SUCH ACTIVITIES

ARE EXPECTED TO BE ABOUT $2.5 BILLION IN BOTH 2002 AND 2003 (WITH CAPITAL

EXPENDITURES REPRESENTING ABOUT 50 PERCENT OF THE TOTAL). THE PROJECTED

INCREASE IS PRIMARILY FOR CAPITAL PROJECTS TO IMPLEMENT REFINING TECHNOLOGY TO

MANUFACTURE LOW-SULFUR MOTOR FUELS IN MANY PARTS OF THE WORLD.

OPERATING DATA AND INDUSTRY SEGMENT INFORMATION FOR THE CORPORATION ARE

CONTAINED ON PAGES 55, 56 AND 62; INFORMATION ON OIL AND GAS RESERVES IS

CONTAINED ON PAGES 59 AND 60 AND INFORMATION ON COMPANY-SPONSORED RESEARCH AND

DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES IS CONTAINED ON PAGE 40 OF THE FINANCIAL SECTION OF THIS

REPORT.

FACTORS AFFECTING FUTURE RESULTS

--------------------------------

COMPETITIVE FACTORS:  THE ENERGY AND PETROCHEMICAL INDUSTRIES ARE HIGHLY

COMPETITIVE. THERE IS COMPETITION WITHIN THE INDUSTRIES AND ALSO WITH OTHER

INDUSTRIES IN SUPPLYING THE ENERGY, FUEL AND CHEMICAL NEEDS OF INDUSTRY AND

INDIVIDUAL CONSUMERS. THE CORPORATION COMPETES WITH OTHER FIRMS IN THE SALE OR

PURCHASE OF VARIOUS GOODS OR SERVICES IN MANY NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL

MARKETS AND EMPLOYS ALL METHODS OF COMPETITION WHICH ARE LAWFUL AND APPROPRIATE

FOR SUCH PURPOSES. A KEY COMPONENT OF THE CORPORATION'S COMPETITIVE POSITION,

PARTICULARLY GIVEN THE COMMODITY-BASED NATURE OF MANY OF ITS PRODUCTS, IS ITS

ABILITY TO MANAGE OPERATING EXPENSES SUCCESSFULLY, WHICH REQUIRES CONTINUOUS

MANAGEMENT FOCUS ON REDUCING UNIT COSTS AND IMPROVING EFFICIENCY.

POLITICAL FACTORS:  THE OPERATIONS AND EARNINGS OF THE CORPORATION AND ITS

AFFILIATES THROUGHOUT THE WORLD HAVE BEEN, AND MAY IN THE FUTURE BE, AFFECTED

FROM TIME TO TIME IN VARYING DEGREE BY POLITICAL INSTABILITY AND BY OTHER

POLITICAL DEVELOPMENTS AND LAWS AND REGULATIONS, SUCH AS FORCED DIVESTITURE OF

ASSETS; RESTRICTIONS ON PRODUCTION, IMPORTS AND EXPORTS; WAR OR OTHER

INTERNATIONAL CONFLICTS; CIVIL UNREST AND LOCAL SECURITY CONCERNS THAT THREATEN

THE SAFE OPERATION OF COMPANY FACILITIES; PRICE CONTROLS; TAX INCREASES AND

RETROACTIVE TAX CLAIMS; EXPROPRIATION OF PROPERTY; CANCELLATION OF

1

CONTRACT RIGHTS; AND ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS. BOTH THE LIKELIHOOD OF SUCH

OCCURRENCES AND THEIR OVERALL EFFECT UPON THE CORPORATION VARY GREATLY FROM

COUNTRY TO COUNTRY AND ARE NOT PREDICTABLE.

INDUSTRY AND ECONOMIC FACTORS:  THE OPERATIONS AND EARNINGS OF THE

CORPORATION AND ITS AFFILIATES THROUGHOUT THE WORLD ARE AFFECTED BY LOCAL,

REGIONAL AND GLOBAL EVENTS OR CONDITIONS THAT AFFECT SUPPLY AND DEMAND FOR OIL,

NATURAL GAS, PETROLEUM PRODUCTS, PETROCHEMICALS AND OTHER EXXONMOBIL PRODUCTS.

THESE EVENTS OR CONDITIONS ARE GENERALLY NOT PREDICTABLE AND INCLUDE, AMONG

OTHER THINGS, GENERAL ECONOMIC GROWTH RATES AND THE OCCURRENCE OF ECONOMIC

RECESSIONS; THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW SUPPLY SOURCES; ADHERENCE BY COUNTRIES TO

OPEC QUOTAS; SUPPLY DISRUPTIONS; WEATHER, INCLUDING SEASONAL PATTERNS THAT

AFFECT ENERGY DEMAND AND SEVERE WEATHER EVENTS THAT CAN DISRUPT OPERATIONS;

TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES, INCLUDING ADVANCES IN EXPLORATION, PRODUCTION,

REFINING, AND PETROCHEMICAL MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY AND ADVANCES IN TECHNOLOGY

RELATING TO ENERGY USAGE; CHANGES IN DEMOGRAPHICS, INCLUDING POPULATION GROWTH

RATES AND CONSUMER PREFERENCES; AND THE COMPETITIVENESS OF ALTERNATIVE ENERGY

SOURCES OR PRODUCT SUBSTITUTES.

PROJECT FACTORS:  IN ADDITION TO THE FACTORS CITED ABOVE, THE ADVANCEMENT,

COST AND RESULTS OF PARTICULAR EXXONMOBIL PROJECTS DEPEND ON THE OUTCOME OF

NEGOTIATIONS WITH PARTNERS, GOVERNMENTS, SUPPLIERS, CUSTOMERS OR OTHERS;

CHANGES IN OPERATING CONDITIONS OR COSTS; AND THE OCCURRENCE OF UNFORESEEN

TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES.

MARKET RISK FACTORS:  SEE PAGES 29 AND 30 OF THE FINANCIAL SECTION OF THIS

REPORT FOR DISCUSSION OF THE IMPACT OF MARKET RISKS, INFLATION AND OTHER

UNCERTAINTIES.

PROJECTIONS, ESTIMATES AND DESCRIPTIONS OF EXXONMOBIL'S PLANS AND OBJECTIVES

INCLUDED OR INCORPORATED IN ITEMS 1, 2, 7 AND 7A OF THIS REPORT ARE

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS. ACTUAL FUTURE RESULTS, INCLUDING PROJECT COMPLETION

DATES, PRODUCTION RATES, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, COSTS AND BUSINESS PLANS COULD

DIFFER MATERIALLY DUE TO, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE FACTORS DISCUSSED ABOVE AND

ELSEWHERE IN THIS REPORT.

ITEM 2.  PROPERTIES.

PART OF THE INFORMATION IN RESPONSE TO THIS ITEM AND TO THE SECURITIES

EXCHANGE ACT INDUSTRY GUIDE 2 IS CONTAINED IN THE FINANCIAL SECTION OF THIS

REPORT IN NOTE 10, WHICH NOTE APPEARS ON PAGE 42, AND ON PAGES 57 THROUGH 62.

INFORMATION WITH REGARD TO OIL AND GAS PRODUCING ACTIVITIES FOLLOWS.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

1.  NET RESERVES OF CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS LIQUIDS (MILLIONS OF BARRELS) AND

NATURAL GAS (BILLIONS OF CUBIC FEET) AT YEAR-END 2001

ESTIMATED PROVED RESERVES ARE SHOWN ON PAGES 59 AND 60 OF THE FINANCIAL

SECTION OF THIS REPORT. NO MAJOR DISCOVERY OR OTHER FAVORABLE OR ADVERSE EVENT

HAS OCCURRED SINCE DECEMBER 31, 2001, THAT WOULD CAUSE A SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN

THE ESTIMATED PROVED RESERVES AS OF THAT DATE. FOR INFORMATION ON THE

STANDARDIZED MEASURE OF DISCOUNTED FUTURE NET CASH FLOWS RELATING TO PROVED OIL

AND GAS RESERVES, SEE PAGE 61 OF THE FINANCIAL SECTION OF THIS REPORT.

2.  ESTIMATES OF TOTAL NET PROVED OIL AND GAS RESERVES FILED WITH OTHER FEDERAL

AGENCIES

DURING 2001, EXXONMOBIL FILED PROVED RESERVES ESTIMATES WITH THE U.S.

DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY ON FORMS EIA-23 AND EIA-28. THE INFORMATION ON FORM EIA-28

IS PRESENTED ON THE SAME BASIS AS THE REGISTRANT'S ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K

FOR 2000, WHICH SHOWS EXXONMOBIL'S NET INTERESTS IN ALL LIQUIDS AND GAS RESERVE

VOLUMES AND CHANGES THERETO FROM BOTH EXXONMOBIL-OPERATED PROPERTIES AND

PROPERTIES OPERATED BY OTHERS. THE DATA ON FORM EIA-23, ALTHOUGH CONSISTENT

WITH THE DATA ON

2

FORM EIA-28, IS PRESENTED ON A DIFFERENT BASIS, AND INCLUDES 100 PERCENT OF THE

OIL AND GAS VOLUMES FROM EXXONMOBIL-OPERATED PROPERTIES ONLY, REGARDLESS OF THE

COMPANY'S NET INTEREST. IN ADDITION, FORM EIA-23 INFORMATION DOES NOT INCLUDE

GAS PLANT LIQUIDS. THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE OIL RESERVES REPORTED ON EIA-23

AND THOSE REPORTED IN THE REGISTRANT'S ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR 2000

EXCEEDS FIVE PERCENT. THE DIFFERENCE IN GAS RESERVES DID NOT EXCEED FIVE

PERCENT.

3.  AVERAGE SALES PRICES AND PRODUCTION COSTS PER UNIT OF PRODUCTION

REFERENCE IS MADE TO PAGE 57 OF THE FINANCIAL SECTION OF THIS REPORT.

AVERAGE SALES PRICES HAVE BEEN CALCULATED BY USING SALES QUANTITIES FROM OUR

OWN PRODUCTION AS THE DIVISOR. AVERAGE PRODUCTION COSTS HAVE BEEN COMPUTED BY

USING NET PRODUCTION QUANTITIES FOR THE DIVISOR. THE VOLUMES OF CRUDE OIL AND

NATURAL GAS LIQUIDS (NGL) PRODUCTION USED FOR THIS COMPUTATION ARE SHOWN IN THE

RESERVES TABLE ON PAGE 59 OF THE FINANCIAL SECTION OF THIS REPORT. THE NET

PRODUCTION VOLUMES OF NATURAL GAS AVAILABLE FOR SALE USED IN THIS CALCULATION

ARE SHOWN ON PAGE 62 OF THE FINANCIAL SECTION OF THIS REPORT. THE VOLUMES OF

NATURAL GAS WERE CONVERTED TO OIL-EQUIVALENT BARRELS BASED ON A CONVERSION

FACTOR OF SIX THOUSAND CUBIC FEET PER BARREL.

7.  SUMMARY OF ACREAGE TERMS IN KEY AREAS

UNITED STATES

OIL AND GAS LEASES HAVE AN EXPLORATION PERIOD RANGING FROM ONE TO TEN YEARS,

AND A PRODUCTION PERIOD THAT NORMALLY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL PRODUCTION

CEASES. IN SOME INSTANCES, A "FEE INTEREST" IS ACQUIRED WHERE BOTH THE SURFACE

AND THE UNDERLYING MINERAL INTERESTS ARE OWNED OUTRIGHT.

CANADA

EXPLORATION PERMITS ARE GRANTED FOR VARYING PERIODS OF TIME WITH RENEWALS

POSSIBLE. PRODUCTION LEASES ARE HELD AS LONG AS THERE IS PRODUCTION ON THE

LEASE. THE MAJORITY OF COLD LAKE LEASES WERE TAKEN FOR AN INITIAL 21-YEAR TERM

IN 1968-1969 AND RENEWED FOR A SECOND 21-YEAR TERM IN 1989-1990. THE

EXPLORATION ACREAGE IN EASTERN CANADA IS CURRENTLY HELD BY WORK COMMITMENTS OF

VARIOUS AMOUNTS.

EUROPE

FRANCE

EXPLORATION PERMITS ARE GRANTED FOR PERIODS OF THREE TO FIVE YEARS, AND ARE

RENEWABLE UP TO TWO TIMES ACCOMPANIED BY SUBSTANTIAL ACREAGE RELINQUISHMENTS.

50 PERCENT OF THE ACREAGE AT FIRST RENEWAL; 25 PERCENT OF THE REMAINING ACREAGE

AT SECOND RENEWAL. A 1994 LAW REQUIRES A BIDDING PROCESS PRIOR TO GRANTING OF

AN EXPLORATION PERMIT. UPON DISCOVERY OF COMMERCIAL HYDROCARBONS, A PRODUCTION

CONCESSION IS GRANTED FOR UP TO 50 YEARS, RENEWABLE IN PERIODS OF 25 YEARS EACH.

GERMANY

EXPLORATION CONCESSIONS ARE GRANTED FOR AN INITIAL MAXIMUM PERIOD OF FIVE

YEARS WITH POSSIBLE EXTENSIONS OF UP TO THREE YEARS FOR AN INDEFINITE PERIOD.

ENTITLED TO TWO SUBSEQUENT EXTENSIONS OF THREE YEARS EACH. THE PROGRAM OF BOTH

THE FIRST AND SECOND EXTENSION PERIOD MUST INCLUDE THE DRILLING OF A FURTHER

WELL. PRODUCTION LICENSES ARE AWARDED FOR A PERIOD OF 20 YEARS UPON DISCOVERY

OF COMMERCIAL HYDROCARBONS. AFTER 15 YEARS, THE LICENSE HOLDER CAN APPLY FOR AN

EXTENSION OF TEN YEARS. AFTER SEVEN YEARS OF THE FIRST EXTENSION PERIOD, THE

LICENSE HOLDER CAN APPLY FOR A FURTHER EXTENSION.

4

NETHERLANDS

ONSHORE: PERMITS ARE ISSUED FOR A PERIOD OF TIME NECESSARY TO PERFORM THE

ACTIVITIES FOR WHICH THE PERMIT IS ISSUED. PRODUCTION CONCESSIONS ARE GRANTED

AFTER DISCOVERIES HAVE BEEN MADE, UNDER CONDITIONS THAT ARE NEGOTIATED WITH THE

GOVERNMENT. NORMALLY, THEY ARE FIELD-LIFE CONCESSIONS COVERING AN AREA DEFINED

BY HYDROCARBON OCCURRENCES.

OFFSHORE: PROSPECTING LICENSES ISSUED PRIOR TO MARCH 1976 WERE FOR A 15-YEAR

PERIOD, WITH RELINQUISHMENT OF ABOUT 50 PERCENT OF THE ORIGINAL AREA REQUIRED

AT THE END OF TEN YEARS. PROSPECTING LICENSES ISSUED BETWEEN 1976 AND 1996 WERE

FOR A TEN-YEAR PERIOD, WITH RELINQUISHMENT OF ABOUT 50 PERCENT OF THE ORIGINAL

AREA REQUIRED AT THE END OF SIX YEARS. CURRENT LICENSES ARE FOR A PERIOD OF

TIME NECESSARY TO PERFORM THE ACTIVITIES FOR WHICH THE PERMIT IS ISSUED. FOR

COMMERCIAL DISCOVERIES WITHIN A PROSPECTING LICENSE, A PRODUCTION LICENSE IS

NORMALLY ISSUED FOR A 40-YEAR PERIOD.

NORWAY

LICENSES ISSUED PRIOR TO 1972 WERE FOR AN INITIAL PERIOD OF SIX YEARS AND AN

EXTENSION PERIOD OF 40 YEARS, WITH RELINQUISHMENT OF AT LEAST ONE-FOURTH OF THE

ORIGINAL AREA REQUIRED AT THE END OF THE SIXTH YEAR AND ANOTHER ONE-FOURTH AT

THE END OF THE NINTH YEAR. LICENSES ISSUED BETWEEN 1972 AND 1997 WERE FOR AN

INITIAL PERIOD OF UP TO TEN YEARS AND AN EXTENSION PERIOD OF UP TO 30 YEARS,

WITH RELINQUISHMENT OF AT LEAST ONE-HALF OF THE ORIGINAL AREA REQUIRED AT THE

END OF THE SIXTH YEAR. LICENSES ISSUED AFTER JULY 1, 1997 HAVE AN INITIAL

PERIOD OF FOUR TO TEN YEARS AND A NORMAL EXTENSION PERIOD OF UP TO 30 YEARS OR

IN SPECIAL CASES OF UP TO 50 YEARS, AND WITH RELINQUISHMENT OF AT LEAST

ONE-HALF OF THE ORIGINAL AREA REQUIRED AT THE END OF THE INITIAL PERIOD.

UNITED KINGDOM

ACREAGE TERMS ARE FIXED BY THE GOVERNMENT AND ARE PERIODICALLY CHANGED. FOR

EXAMPLE, THE REGULATIONS GOVERNING LICENSES ISSUED BETWEEN 1996 AND 1998

PROVIDED FOR AN INITIAL TERM OF THREE YEARS WITH POSSIBLE EXTENSIONS OF SIX, 15

AND 24 YEARS FOR A LICENSE PERIOD OF 45 MORE YEARS. AFTER THE SECOND EXTENSION,

THE LICENSE MUST BE SURRENDERED IN PART. IN RECENT LICENSING ROUNDS, THE

INITIAL TERM HAS GENERALLY BEEN FOR SIX YEARS. AFTER POSSIBLE SURRENDER OF

ACREAGE, THE LICENSE MAY CONTINUE FOR 30 MORE YEARS.

ASIA-PACIFIC

AUSTRALIA

ONSHORE: ACREAGE TERMS ARE FIXED BY THE INDIVIDUAL STATE AND TERRITORY

GOVERNMENTS. THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS VARY SIGNIFICANTLY BETWEEN THE STATES

AND TERRITORIES. EXPLORATION PERMITS ARE NORMALLY GRANTED FOR A TERM OF TWO TO

SIX YEARS (IN SOME STATES THE PETROLEUM MINISTER FIXES THE TERM) WITH POSSIBLE

RENEWALS AND RELINQUISHMENT. PRODUCTION LICENSES IN SOUTH AUSTRALIA ARE GRANTED

FOR AN INITIAL TERM OF 21 YEARS, WITH SUBSEQUENT RENEWALS, EACH FOR 21 YEARS,

FOR THE FULL AREA. PRODUCTION LICENSES IN QUEENSLAND ARE GRANTED FOR VARYING

PERIODS CONSISTENT WITH EXPECTED FIELD LIVES, WITH RENEWALS ON A SIMILAR BASIS.

OFFSHORE: ACREAGE TERMS ARE FIXED BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT BEYOND THE THREE

NAUTICAL MILE LIMIT OFFSHORE (APPLYING TO ALL OF EXXONMOBIL'S OFFSHORE

ACREAGE), IN MOST CASES BY LEGISLATION, BUT IN SOME CASES BY THE JOINT

AUTHORITY (COMPOSED OF FEDERAL AND STATE MINISTERS) AT THE TIME OF GRANT.

EXPLORATION PERMITS ARE GRANTED FOR SIX YEARS WITH POSSIBLE RENEWALS OF

FIVE-YEAR PERIODS. A 50 PERCENT RELINQUISHMENT OF REMAINING AREA IS MANDATORY

AT THE END OF EACH RENEWAL PERIOD. RETENTION LEASES MAY BE GRANTED FOR

RESOURCES THAT ARE NOT COMMERCIALLY VIABLE AT THE TIME OF APPLICATION, BUT ARE

EXPECTED TO BECOME COMMERCIALLY VIABLE WITHIN 15 YEARS. THESE ARE GRANTED FOR

PERIODS OF FIVE YEARS

5

AND RENEWALS MAY BE REQUESTED. PRIOR TO SEPTEMBER 1998, PRODUCTION LICENSES

WERE GRANTED INITIALLY FOR 21 YEARS, WITH A FURTHER RENEWAL OF 21 YEARS AND

THEREAFTER RENEWALS AT THE DISCRETION OF THE JOINT AUTHORITY. EFFECTIVE

SEPTEMBER 1998, NEW PRODUCTION LICENSES ARE TO BE GRANTED "INDEFINITELY", I.E.,

FOR THE LIFE OF THE FIELD (IF NO OPERATIONS FOR THE RECOVERY OF PETROLEUM HAVE

BEEN CARRIED ON FOR FIVE YEARS, THE LICENSE MAY BE TERMINATED).

INDONESIA

EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION ACTIVITIES IN INDONESIA ARE GENERALLY GOVERNED BY

COOPERATION CONTRACTS, USUALLY IN THE FORM OF A PRODUCTION SHARING CONTRACT,

NEGOTIATED WITH THE NATIONAL OIL COMPANY. HOWEVER, EFFECTIVE NOVEMBER 23, 2001,

PURSUANT TO THE NEW OIL AND GAS LAW, THE NATIONAL OIL COMPANY'S ROLE AS MANAGER

OF UPSTREAM ACTIVITIES UNDER EXISTING AND FUTURE CONTRACTS WILL BE TRANSFERRED

TO AN UPSTREAM REGULATORY BODY (STILL TO BE ESTABLISHED) REPORTING TO THE

MINISTER OF ENERGY AND MINERAL RESOURCES. EXISTING COOPERATION CONTRACTS WILL

BE AMENDED TO REFLECT THE TRANSFER OF AUTHORITY TO THE UPSTREAM REGULATORY

BODY; HOWEVER, THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THE EXISTING CONTRACTS WILL REMAIN

UNCHANGED. FUTURE COOPERATION CONTRACTS WILL BE ENTERED INTO WITH THE UPSTREAM

REGULATORY BODY. REGULATIONS ARE BEING DEVELOPED TO IMPLEMENT THE NEW LAW.

MALAYSIA

EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION ACTIVITIES ARE GOVERNED BY PRODUCTION SHARING

CONTRACTS NEGOTIATED WITH THE NATIONAL OIL COMPANY. THE MORE RECENT CONTRACTS

HAVE AN OVERALL TERM OF 24 TO 37 YEARS WITH POSSIBLE EXTENSIONS TO THE

EXPLORATION OR DEVELOPMENT PERIODS. THE EXPLORATION PERIOD IS FIVE TO SEVEN

YEARS WITH THE POSSIBILITY OF EXTENSIONS, AFTER WHICH TIME AREAS WITH NO

COMMERCIAL DISCOVERIES MUST BE RELINQUISHED. THE DEVELOPMENT PERIOD IS FOUR TO

FIVE YEARS FROM COMMERCIAL DISCOVERY, WITH THE POSSIBILITY OF EXTENSIONS UNDER

SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES. AREAS FROM WHICH COMMERCIAL PRODUCTION HAS NOT STARTED

BY THE END OF THE DEVELOPMENT PERIOD MUST BE RELINQUISHED IF NO EXTENSION IS

GRANTED. THE TOTAL PRODUCTION PERIOD IS 15 TO 25 YEARS FROM FIRST COMMERCIAL

LIFTING, NOT TO EXCEED THE OVERALL TERM OF THE CONTRACT.

PAPUA NEW GUINEA

EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION ACTIVITIES ARE GOVERNED BY THE OIL AND GAS ACT.

EXPLORATION LICENSES ARE GRANTED FOR AN INITIAL TERM OF SIX YEARS WITH A

FIVE-YEAR EXTENSION POSSIBLE. GENERALLY, A 50 PERCENT RELINQUISHMENT OF THE

LICENSE AREA IS REQUIRED AT THE END OF THE INITIAL SIX-YEAR TERM, IF EXTENDED.

PRODUCTION LICENSES ARE GRANTED FOR AN INITIAL 25-YEAR PERIOD. AN EXTENSION OF

UP TO 20 YEARS MAY BE GRANTED AT THE MINISTER'S DISCRETION. PETROLEUM RETENTION

LICENSES MAY BE GRANTED FOR GAS RESOURCES THAT ARE NOT COMMERCIALLY VIABLE AT

THE TIME OF APPLICATION, BUT THAT MAY BECOME COMMERCIALLY VIABLE. THESE

LICENSES ARE GRANTED FOR FIVE-YEAR TERMS, AND MAY BE EXTENDED TWICE FOR A

MAXIMUM RETENTION TIME OF 15 YEARS.

THAILAND

THE PETROLEUM ACT OF 1972 ALLOWS PRODUCTION UNDER EXXONMOBIL'S CONCESSION

FOR 30 YEARS (THROUGH 2021) WITH A POSSIBLE TEN-YEAR EXTENSION AT TERMS

GENERALLY PREVALENT AT THE TIME.

AFRICA

ANGOLA

EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION ACTIVITIES ARE GOVERNED BY PRODUCTION SHARING

AGREEMENTS WITH AN INITIAL EXPLORATION TERM OF FOUR YEARS AND AN OPTIONAL

SECOND PHASE OF TWO TO THREE YEARS. THE PRODUCTION PERIOD IS FOR 25 YEARS AND

AGREEMENTS GENERALLY PROVIDE FOR A NEGOTIATED EXTENSION.

6

CAMEROON

EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION ACTIVITIES ARE GOVERNED BY AGREEMENTS NEGOTIATED

WITH THE NATIONAL OIL COMPANY. THE CONCESSIONS HAVE VARIOUS AGREEMENTS WITH

REGARD TO LICENSE EXTENSION, TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR THE EXPLORATION AND

PRODUCTION PHASE.

CHAD

EXPLORATION PERMITS ARE ISSUED FOR A PERIOD OF FIVE YEARS, AND ARE RENEWABLE

FOR TWO FURTHER FIVE-YEAR PERIODS. THE PRODUCTION TERM IS FOR 30 YEARS.

EQUATORIAL GUINEA

EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION ACTIVITIES ARE GOVERNED BY PRODUCTION SHARING

CONTRACTS NEGOTIATED WITH THE STATE MINISTRY OF MINES AND ENERGY. THE

EXPLORATION TERM IS FOR TEN TO 15 YEARS WITH LIMITED RELINQUISHMENTS IN THE

ABSENCE OF COMMERCIAL DISCOVERIES. THE PRODUCTION PERIOD FOR CRUDE OIL IS

30 YEARS WHILE THE PRODUCTION PERIOD FOR GAS IS 50 YEARS.

NIGERIA

EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION ACTIVITIES IN THE DEEPWATER OFFSHORE AREAS ARE

TYPICALLY GOVERNED BY PRODUCTION SHARING CONTRACTS (PSCS) WITH THE NATIONAL OIL

COMPANY. THE NATIONAL OIL COMPANY HOLDS THE UNDERLYING OIL PROSPECTING LICENSE

(OPL) AND ANY RESULTING OIL MINING LEASE (OML). THE TERMS OF THE PSCS ARE

GENERALLY 30 YEARS, INCLUDING A TEN-YEAR EXPLORATION PERIOD (SIX-YEAR INITIAL

EXPLORATION PHASE PLUS A FOUR-YEAR OPTIONAL PERIOD) COVERED BY AN OPL. UPON

COMMERCIAL DISCOVERY, AN OPL MAY BE CONVERTED TO AN OML. PARTIAL RELINQUISHMENT

IS REQUIRED AT THE END OF THE TEN-YEAR EXPLORATION PERIOD, AND OMLS HAVE A

20-YEAR PRODUCTION PERIOD THAT MAY BE EXTENDED.

SOME EXPLORATION ACTIVITIES ARE CARRIED OUT IN DEEPWATER BY JOINT VENTURES

WITH INDIGENOUS COMPANIES HOLDING INTERESTS IN AN OPL. OPLS IN DEEPWATER

OFFSHORE AREAS ARE VALID FOR TEN YEARS AND ARE NON-RENEWABLE, WHILE IN ALL

OTHER AREAS THE LICENSES ARE FOR FIVE YEARS AND ALSO ARE NON-RENEWABLE.

DEMONSTRATING A COMMERCIAL DISCOVERY IS THE BASIS FOR CONVERSION OF AN OPL TO

INFORMATION WITH REGARD TO MINING ACTIVITIES FOLLOWS.

----------------------------------------------------

SYNCRUDE OPERATIONS

SYNCRUDE IS A JOINT-VENTURE ESTABLISHED TO RECOVER SHALLOW DEPOSITS OF TAR

SANDS USING OPEN-PIT MINING METHODS, TO EXTRACT THE CRUDE BITUMEN, AND TO

PRODUCE A HIGH-QUALITY, LIGHT (32 DEGREE API), SWEET, SYNTHETIC CRUDE OIL. THE

SYNCRUDE OPERATION, LOCATED NEAR FORT MCMURRAY, ALBERTA, CANADA, EXPLOITS A

PORTION OF THE ATHABASCA OIL SANDS DEPOSIT. THE LOCATION IS READILY ACCESSIBLE

BY PUBLIC ROAD. THE PRODUCED SYNTHETIC CRUDE OIL IS SHIPPED FROM THE SYNCRUDE

SITE TO EDMONTON, ALBERTA IN THE ALBERTA OIL SANDS PIPELINE OWNED BY THE

PEMBINA OIL SANDS PIPELINE LIMITED PARTNERSHIP. SINCE START-UP IN 1978,

SYNCRUDE HAS PRODUCED ABOUT 1.3 BILLION BARRELS OF SYNTHETIC CRUDE OIL.

IMPERIAL OIL LIMITED IS THE OWNER OF A 25 PERCENT INTEREST IN THE

JOINT-VENTURE. EXXON MOBIL CORPORATION HAS A 69.6 PERCENT INTEREST IN IMPERIAL

OIL LIMITED.

OPERATING LICENSE AND LEASES

SYNCRUDE HAS AN OPERATING LICENSE ISSUED BY THE PROVINCE OF ALBERTA WHICH IS

EFFECTIVE UNTIL 2035. THIS LICENSE PERMITS SYNCRUDE TO MINE TAR SANDS AND

PRODUCE SYNTHETIC CRUDE OIL FROM APPROVED DEVELOPMENT AREAS ON TAR SANDS

LEASES. SYNCRUDE HOLDS EIGHT TAR SANDS LEASES COVERING APPROXIMATELY 255,000

ACRES IN THE ATHABASCA OIL SANDS DEPOSIT. ISSUED BY THE PROVINCE OF ALBERTA,

THE LEASES ARE AUTOMATICALLY RENEWABLE AS LONG AS TAR SANDS OPERATIONS ARE

ONGOING OR THE LEASES ARE PART OF AN APPROVED DEVELOPMENT PLAN. SYNCRUDE LEASES

10, 12, 17, 22 AND 34 (CONTAINING PROVEN RESERVES) AND LEASES 29, 30 AND 31

(CONTAINING NO PROVEN RESERVES) ARE INCLUDED WITHIN A DEVELOPMENT PLAN APPROVED

BY THE PROVINCE OF ALBERTA'S DEPARTMENT OF RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT. THERE WERE NO

KNOWN PREVIOUS COMMERCIAL OPERATIONS ON THESE LEASES PRIOR TO THE START-UP OF

OPERATIONS IN 1978.

OPERATIONS, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT

OPERATIONS AT SYNCRUDE INVOLVE THREE MAIN PROCESSES: OPEN PIT MINING,

EXTRACTION OF CRUDE BITUMEN AND UPGRADING OF CRUDE BITUMEN INTO SYNTHETIC CRUDE

OIL. IN THE BASE MINE (LEASE 17), THE MINING AND TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM USES

DRAGLINES, BUCKETWHEEL RECLAIMERS AND BELT CONVEYORS. IN THE NORTH MINE (LEASES

17 AND 22) AND IN THE AURORA MINE (LEASES 10, 12 AND 34) TRUCK, SHOVEL AND

HYDROTRANSPORT SYSTEMS ARE USED. PRODUCTION FROM THE AURORA MINE COMMENCED IN

2000. THE EXTRACTION FACILITIES, WHICH SEPARATE CRUDE BITUMEN FROM SAND, ARE

CAPABLE OF PROCESSING APPROXIMATELY 545,000 TONS OF TAR SANDS A DAY, PRODUCING

110 MILLION BARRELS OF CRUDE BITUMEN A YEAR. THIS REPRESENTS RECOVERY

CAPABILITY OF ABOUT 92 PERCENT OF THE CRUDE BITUMEN CONTAINED IN THE MINED TAR

SANDS.

CRUDE BITUMEN EXTRACTED FROM TAR SANDS IS REFINED TO A MARKETABLE

HYDROCARBON PRODUCT THROUGH A COMBINATION OF CARBON REMOVAL IN TWO LARGE,

HIGH-TEMPERATURE, FLUID-COKING VESSELS AND BY HYDROGEN

14

ADDITION IN HIGH-TEMPERATURE, HIGH-PRESSURE, HYDROCRACKING VESSELS. THESE

PROCESSES REMOVE CARBON AND SULFUR AND REFORMULATE THE CRUDE INTO A LOW

VISCOSITY, LOW SULFUR, HIGH-QUALITY SYNTHETIC CRUDE OIL PRODUCT. IN 2001, THIS

UPGRADING PROCESS YIELDED 0.845 BARRELS OF SYNTHETIC CRUDE OIL PER BARREL OF

CRUDE BITUMEN. ABOUT TWO-THIRDS OF THE SYNTHETIC CRUDE OIL IS PROCESSED BY

EDMONTON AREA REFINERIES AND THE REMAINING ONE-THIRD IS PIPELINED TO REFINERIES

IN EASTERN CANADA AND THE MID-WESTERN UNITED STATES. ELECTRICITY IS PROVIDED TO

SYNCRUDE BY A 270 MEGAWATT ELECTRICITY GENERATING PLANT AND AN 80 MEGAWATT

ELECTRICITY GENERATING PLANT, BOTH LOCATED AT SYNCRUDE. THE GENERATING PLANTS

ARE OWNED BY THE SYNCRUDE PARTICIPANTS. IMPERIAL OIL LIMITED'S 25 PERCENT SHARE

OF NET INVESTMENT IN PLANT, PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT, INCLUDING SURFACE MINING

FACILITIES, TRANSPORTATION EQUIPMENT AND UPGRADING FACILITIES WAS $750 MILLION

AT YEAR END 2001.

SYNTHETIC CRUDE OIL RESERVES

THE CRUDE BITUMEN IS CONTAINED WITHIN THE UNCONSOLIDATED SANDS OF THE

MCMURRAY FORMATION. ORE BODIES ARE BURIED BENEATH 50 TO 150 FEET OF OVERBURDEN,

HAVE BITUMEN GRADES RANGING FROM 4 TO 14 WEIGHT PERCENT AND ORE THICKNESS OF

115 TO 160 FEET. ESTIMATES OF SYNTHETIC CRUDE OIL RESERVES ARE BASED ON

DETAILED GEOLOGICAL AND ENGINEERING ASSESSMENTS OF IN-PLACE CRUDE BITUMEN

VOLUME, THE MINING PLAN, HISTORICAL EXTRACTION RECOVERY AND UPGRADING YIELD

FACTORS, INSTALLED PLANT OPERATING CAPACITY AND OPERATING APPROVAL LIMITS. THE

IN-PLACE VOLUME, DEPTH AND GRADE ARE ESTABLISHED THROUGH EXTENSIVE AND CLOSELY

SPACED CORE DRILLING. PROVEN RESERVES INCLUDE THE OPERATING BASE AND NORTH

MINES AND THE AURORA MINE. IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE APPROVED MINING PLAN, THERE

ARE AN ESTIMATED 3,500 MILLION TONS OF EXTRACTABLE TAR SANDS IN THE BASE AND

NORTH MINES, WITH AN AVERAGE BITUMEN GRADE OF 10.4 WEIGHT PERCENT. IN ADDITION,

AT THE AURORA MINE, THERE ARE AN ESTIMATED 4,090 MILLION TONS OF EXTRACTABLE

TAR SANDS AT AN AVERAGE BITUMEN GRADE OF 11.3 WEIGHT PERCENT. AFTER DEDUCTING

ROYALTIES PAYABLE TO THE PROVINCE OF ALBERTA, IMPERIAL OIL LIMITED ESTIMATES

THAT ITS 25 PERCENT NET SHARE OF PROVEN RESERVES AT YEAR END 2001 WAS

EQUIVALENT TO 821 MILLION BARRELS OF SYNTHETIC CRUDE OIL.

IN 2001, THE SYNCRUDE OWNERS ENDORSED A FURTHER DEVELOPMENT OF THE SYNCRUDE

RESOURCE IN THE AREA AND EXPANSION OF THE UPGRADING FACILITIES. THE SYNCRUDE

AURORA 2 AND UPGRADER EXPANSION 1 PROJECT ADDS A REMOTE MINING DEVELOPMENT AND

EXPANDS THE CENTRAL PROCESSING AND UPGRADING PLANT. THIS EXPANSION INCREASES

PROVEN SYNCRUDE RESERVES BY 230 MILLION BARRELS AND WILL LEAD TO TOTAL

PRODUCTION OF ABOUT 370 THOUSAND BARRELS OF SYNTHETIC CRUDE OIL PER DAY (GROSS)

WHEN COMPLETED.

ITEM 3.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.

ON DECEMBER 20, 2001, THE U.S. ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY ("EPA")

ISSUED A NOTICE OF VIOLATION ("NOV") REGARDING THE CORPORATION'S BEAUMONT,

TEXAS REFINERY, ALLEGING THAT THE CORPORATION FAILED TO OBTAIN PREVENTION OF

SIGNIFICANT DETERIORATION PERMITS RELATING TO TURNAROUND PROJECTS AT THE

REFINERY THAT ALLEGEDLY RESULTED IN SIGNIFICANT NET EMISSION INCREASES OF

NITROGEN OXIDES AND SULFUR OXIDES.

ON DECEMBER 20, 2001, THE EPA ISSUED AN NOV FOR A REFINERY IN CHALMETTE,

LOUISIANA THAT IS OPERATED AND 50 PERCENT-OWNED BY WHOLLY OWNED SUBSIDIARIES OF

THE CORPORATION. THE EPA ALLEGES SEVERAL VIOLATIONS OF THE CLEAN AIR ACT AT THE

REFINERY, INCLUDING FAILURE TO PROPERLY MONITOR FUGITIVE EMISSIONS LEAKS AT THE

ISOMERIZATION AND REFORMER UNITS, FAILURE TO MAINTAIN AIR POLLUTION CONTROL

EQUIPMENT ON A SEPARATOR, AND BURNING FUEL GAS WITH ELEVATED HYDROGEN SULFIDE

CONCENTRATIONS IN TWO HEATERS.

ALTHOUGH THE EPA HAS NOT YET MADE A DEMAND FOR SPECIFIC FINES OR PENALTIES

IN EITHER OF THE NOVS DESCRIBED ABOVE, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE EPA COULD SEEK

PENALTIES IN EXCESS OF $100,000.

THE NEW MEXICO ENVIRONMENT DEPARTMENT ("NMED") HAS ISSUED A COMPLIANCE ORDER

REQUIRING COMPLIANCE AND ASSESSING A CIVIL PENALTY WITH RESPECT TO ALLEGED

VIOLATIONS OF IMPLEMENTING REGULATIONS OF THE NEW MEXICO AIR QUALITY CONTROL

ACT AT THE MOBIL PIPE LINE COMPANY'S TANK BATTERY STATION IN BUCKEYE, NEW

MEXICO. THE ALLEGED VIOLATIONS INCLUDE A FAILURE TO INSTALL A CONTROL DEVICE ON

A STORAGE TANK, FAILURE TO OBTAIN A PERMIT PRIOR TO CONSTRUCTION OF A STORAGE

TANK, AND FAILURE TO TEST, MONITOR, REPORT AND KEEP RECORDS FOR A STORAGE TANK.

PURSUANT TO THE ORDER, ISSUED ON JUNE 13, 2001, THE NMED IS SEEKING A CIVIL

PENALTY OF $231,120. MOBIL PIPE LINE COMPANY HAS APPEALED THIS ORDER, AND THE

HEARING HAS BEEN POSTPONED INDEFINITELY PENDING THE STATUS OF SETTLEMENT

DISCUSSIONS. SETTLEMENT DISCUSSIONS WITH THE NMED TO RESOLVE THIS MATTER ARE

ONGOING.

FINANCIAL REPORTING FAIRLY REFLECT ITS STRAIGHTFORWARD BUSINESS MODEL INVOLVING

THE EXTRACTING, REFINING AND MARKETING OF HYDROCARBONS AND HYDROCARBON-BASED

PRODUCTS. THE CORPORATION'S BUSINESS MODEL INVOLVES THE PRODUCTION (OR

PURCHASE), MANUFACTURE AND SALE OF PHYSICAL PRODUCTS, AND ALL COMMERCIAL

ACTIVITIES ARE DIRECTLY IN SUPPORT OF THE UNDERLYING PHYSICAL MOVEMENT OF GOODS.

THIS STRAIGHTFORWARD APPROACH EXTENDS TO THE FINANCING OF THE BUSINESS. IN

EVALUATING BUSINESS OR INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES, THE CORPORATION VIEWS AS

ECONOMICALLY EQUIVALENT ANY DEBT OBLIGATION, WHETHER DISCLOSED ON THE FACE OF

THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET, OR DISCLOSED AS OTHER DEBT-LIKE OBLIGATIONS IN

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, SUCH AS THOSE SUMMARIZED IN THE TABLE ON PAGE

26. THIS CONSISTENT, CONSERVATIVE APPROACH TO FINANCING THE CAPITAL-INTENSIVE

NEEDS OF THE CORPORATION HAS HELPED EXXONMOBIL TO SUSTAIN THE "TRIPLE-A" STATUS

OF ITS LONG-TERM DEBT SECURITIES FOR MORE THAN EIGHTY YEARS.

REVIEW OF 2001 RESULTS

EARNINGS EXCLUDING MERGER EFFECTS AND SPECIAL ITEMS WERE $15,630 MILLION, A

DECREASE OF $1,280 MILLION FROM 2000. NET INCOME IN 2001 WAS $15,320 MILLION,

INCLUDING $215 MILLION OF EXTRAORDINARY GAINS AND $525 MILLION OF MERGER COSTS,

A DECREASE OF $2,400 MILLION FROM 2000, WHICH BENEFITED FROM $810 MILLION IN NET

FAVORABLE MERGER EFFECTS INCLUDING GAINS FROM DIVESTMENTS REQUIRED AS A

CONDITION OF REGULATORY APPROVAL OF THE MERGER. UPSTREAM (EXPLORATION AND

PRODUCTION) EARNINGS IN 2001 DECLINED, FOLLOWING LOWER CRUDE OIL REALIZATIONS,

WHICH ON AVERAGE WERE DOWN 18 PERCENT VERSUS 2000. UPSTREAM VOLUMES IN 2001, ON

AN OIL EQUIVALENT BASIS, WERE UP 1 PERCENT EXCLUDING THE EFFECT OF REDUCED

NATURAL GAS PRODUCTION OPERATIONS IN INDONESIA DUE TO SECURITY CONCERNS.

DOWNSTREAM (REFINING AND MARKETING) EARNINGS IMPROVED FROM 2000, REFLECTING

STRONGER U.S. REFINING MARGINS AND IMPROVED MARKETING RESULTS OUTSIDE OF THE

U.S. CHEMICALS EARNINGS DECLINED VERSUS 2000, AS LOWER PRODUCT REALIZATIONS AND

WEAKENING DEMAND CONDITIONS PUT SIGNIFICANT PRESSURE ON COMMODITY MARGINS AND

MORE THAN OFFSET THE $175 MILLION OF EXTRAORDINARY GAINS ASSOCIATED WITH ASSET

MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES. PRIME PRODUCT SALES VOLUMES WERE 1 PERCENT HIGHER THAN

2000, REFLECTING CAPACITY ADDITIONS IN SINGAPORE AND SAUDI ARABIA. MERGER

IMPLEMENTATION ACTIVITIES IN 2001 REDUCED EARNINGS BY A NET $485 MILLION. GAINS

FROM ASSET DIVESTITURES THAT WERE A CONDITION OF REGULATORY APPROVAL OF THE

MERGER ADDED $40 MILLION TO EARNINGS, PARTLY OFFSETTING MERGER IMPLEMENTATION

EXPENSES OF $525 MILLION. REVENUE FOR 2001 TOTALED $213 BILLION, DOWN 8 PERCENT

FROM 2000.

EXCLUDING MERGER EXPENSES, THE COMBINED TOTAL OF OPERATING COSTS (INCLUDING

OPERATING, SELLING, GENERAL, ADMINISTRATIVE, EXPLORATION, DEPRECIATION AND

DEPLETION EXPENSES FROM THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF INCOME AND EXXONMOBIL'S

SHARE OF SIMILAR COSTS FOR EQUITY COMPANIES) IN 2001 WAS $44.0 BILLION, UP $400

MILLION FROM 2000. COST INCREASES ASSOCIATED WITH NEW OPERATIONS, HIGHER ENERGY

COSTS AND HIGHER PENSION-RELATED EXPENSES WERE SUBSTANTIALLY OFFSET BY THE

FAVORABLE IMPACT OF CONTINUING EFFICIENCY INITIATIVES CARRIED OUT IN ALL

BUSINESS LINES. THE IMPACT OF THESE INITIATIVES, INCLUDING THE CAPTURE OF MERGER

SYNERGIES, REDUCED OPERATING COSTS BY $1.2 BILLION IN 2001, AND CUMULATIVELY BY

$4 BILLION SINCE 1998. INTEREST EXPENSE IN 2001 WAS $293 MILLION COMPARED TO

$589 MILLION IN 2000 REFLECTING LOWER DEBT LEVELS AND INTEREST RATES.

UPSTREAM

UPSTREAM EARNINGS OF $10,429 MILLION DECREASED $1,940 MILLION, OR 16 PERCENT

FROM LAST YEAR'S RECORD LEVEL, PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER CRUDE OIL PRICES. THE

IMPACTS OF LOWER CRUDE REALIZATIONS AND HIGHER EXPLORATION EXPENSES IN FUTURE

GROWTH AREAS WERE PARTLY OFFSET BY HIGHER AVERAGE NATURAL GAS REALIZATIONS,

PRINCIPALLY IN NORTH AMERICA AND EUROPE. U.S. AND CANADIAN NATURAL GAS PRICES

REACHED HISTORICAL HIGHS EARLY IN 2001 BUT DROPPED THROUGH THE REMAINDER OF THE

YEAR. LIQUIDS PRODUCTION IN 2001 OF 2,542 KBD (THOUSANDS OF BARRELS DAILY) WAS

DOWN SLIGHTLY FROM 2000, AS NATURAL FIELD DECLINES IN MATURE AREAS WERE LARGELY

OFFSET BY NEW VOLUMES FROM WORK PROGRAMS AND NEW DEVELOPMENTS IN THE NORTH SEA,

U.S., EQUATORIAL GUINEA AND KAZAKHSTAN, SOME OF WHICH HAVE NOT YET REACHED FULL

CAPACITY. ABSENT THE EFFECT OF REDUCED ARUN OPERATIONS IN INDONESIA DUE TO

SECURITY CONCERNS, WORLDWIDE GAS PRODUCTION WAS UP ABOUT 2 PERCENT, WITH

INCREASES IN EUROPE, AUSTRALIA, CANADA AND QATAR. INCLUDING THE IMPACT OF LOWER

INDONESIA VOLUMES, FULL-YEAR 2001 WORLDWIDE NATURAL GAS PRODUCTION OF 10,279

MCFD (MILLIONS OF CUBIC FEET DAILY) COMPARED WITH 10,343 MCFD IN 2000. COMBINED

LIQUIDS AND GAS VOLUMES, ON AN OIL EQUIVALENT BASIS, WERE UP 1 PERCENT EXCLUDING

THE EFFECT OF REDUCED NATURAL GAS PRODUCTION OPERATIONS IN INDONESIA. EARNINGS

FROM U.S. UPSTREAM OPERATIONS WERE $3,932 MILLION, A DECREASE OF $613 MILLION.

EARNINGS OUTSIDE THE U.S. WERE $6,497 MILLION, $1,327 MILLION LOWER THAN 2000.

DOWNSTREAM

DOWNSTREAM EARNINGS OF $4,227 MILLION WERE A RECORD AND IMPROVED 24 PERCENT OVER

2000. RESULTS BENEFITED FROM HIGHER REFINING MARGINS EARLY IN THE YEAR,

PARTICULARLY IN THE U.S., IMPROVED WORLDWIDE REFINING OPERATIONS AND HIGHER

MARKETING MARGINS OUTSIDE THE U.S. REFINING MARGINS IN MOST AREAS PEAKED IN THE

SECOND QUARTER AND DECLINED DURING THE SECOND HALF OF 2001. EARNINGS ALSO

BENEFITED FROM A PLANNED REDUCTION IN INVENTORIES AS A RESULT OF OPTIMIZING

OPERATIONS AROUND THE WORLD. PETROLEUM PRODUCT SALES OF 7,971 KBD COMPARED WITH

7,993 KBD IN THE PRIOR YEAR. EXCLUDING THE EFFECT OF THE REQUIRED MERGER RELATED

DIVESTMENTS IN 2000, VOLUMES WERE UP SLIGHTLY. REFINERY THROUGHPUT WAS 5,571 KBD

COMPARED WITH 5,642 KBD IN 2000. U.S. DOWNSTREAM EARNINGS WERE $1,924 MILLION,

UP $363 MILLION, REFLECTING STRONGER REFINING MARGINS AND IMPROVED OPERATIONS.

EARNINGS OUTSIDE THE U.S. OF $2,303 MILLION WERE $446 MILLION HIGHER THAN 2000.

THE IMPROVEMENT WAS DRIVEN BY STRONGER MARKETING MARGINS, PARTLY OFFSET BY

WEAKER EUROPEAN REFINING MARGINS.

CHEMICALS

CHEMICALS EARNINGS TOTALED $882 MILLION, INCLUDING $175 MILLION OF NET GAINS ON

ASSET MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES. ABSENT THIS SPECIAL ITEM, CHEMICALS EARNINGS WERE

$707 MILLION, A DECREASE OF $454 MILLION FROM 2000. MOST OF THE REDUCTION

OCCURRED IN THE U.S. AS LOWER PRODUCT REALIZATIONS AND WEAKENING DEMAND

CONDITIONS PUT SIGNIFICANT PRESSURE ON

24

COMMODITY MARGINS. RECORD PRIME PRODUCT SALES VOLUMES OF 25,780 KT (THOUSANDS OF

METRIC TONS) WERE 1 PERCENT ABOVE THE PRIOR YEAR'S RECORD LEVEL AS HIGHER SALES

OUTSIDE THE U.S., REFLECTING CAPACITY ADDITIONS IN SINGAPORE AND SAUDI ARABIA,

WERE PARTLY OFFSET BY LOWER SALES IN THE U.S. REFLECTING WEAKER INDUSTRIAL

DEMAND.

OTHER OPERATIONS

EARNINGS FROM OTHER OPERATING SEGMENTS TOTALED $489 MILLION, A DECREASE OF $62

MILLION FROM 2000, REFLECTING LOWER COPPER PRICES.

CORPORATE AND FINANCING

CORPORATE AND FINANCING EXPENSES DECREASED $367 MILLION TO $222 MILLION,

REFLECTING LOWER NET INTEREST COSTS DUE TO LOWER DEBT LEVELS AND HIGHER CASH

BALANCES, ALONG WITH FAVORABLE FOREIGN EXCHANGE AND TAX EFFECTS.

REVIEW OF 2000 RESULTS

EARNINGS EXCLUDING MERGER EFFECTS AND SPECIAL ITEMS WERE $16,910 MILLION, AN

INCREASE OF $8,530 MILLION FROM 1999. NET INCOME IN 2000 OF $17,720 MILLION,

INCLUDING NET FAVORABLE MERGER EFFECTS OF $810 MILLION, INCREASED $9,810 MILLION

FROM 1999. UPSTREAM EARNINGS BENEFITED FROM HIGHER CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS

REALIZATIONS, WHICH ON AVERAGE WERE UP ABOUT 60 PERCENT AND 45 PERCENT,

RESPECTIVELY, VERSUS 1999. EXCLUDING THE EFFECTS OF LOWER ENTITLEMENTS CAUSED BY

HIGHER CRUDE PRICES, LIQUIDS PRODUCTION WAS 3 PERCENT HIGHER THAN 1999.

DOWNSTREAM EARNINGS IMPROVED FROM THE VERY DEPRESSED RESULTS IN 1999, DRIVEN BY

STRONGER WORLDWIDE REFINING MARGINS AND BETTER REFINING OPERATIONS. HOWEVER,

DOWNSTREAM PROFITABILITY WAS RESTRAINED BY DIFFICULTIES IN RECOVERING THE

SIGNIFICANT INCREASES IN RAW MATERIAL COSTS THAT OCCURRED OVER MUCH OF THE YEAR.

MERGER IMPLEMENTATION ACTIVITIES IN 2000 ADDED A NET $810 MILLION TO NET INCOME,

REFLECTING $1,730 MILLION OF EXTRAORDINARY GAINS FROM ASSET DIVESTITURES THAT

WERE A CONDITION OF REGULATORY APPROVAL OF THE MERGER. THESE GAINS MORE THAN

OFFSET MERGER IMPLEMENTATION EXPENSES OF $920 MILLION. RESULTS IN 1999 INCLUDED

$470 MILLION OF NET CHARGES FOR SPECIAL ITEMS, PRIMARILY MERGER EXPENSES WITH

OTHER SPECIAL ITEMS ESSENTIALLY OFFSETTING. REVENUE FOR 2000 TOTALED $233

BILLION, UP 25 PERCENT FROM 1999, AND THE COST OF CRUDE OIL AND PRODUCT

PURCHASES INCREASED BY 41 PERCENT, BOTH INFLUENCED BY HIGHER PRICES.

EXCLUDING MERGER EXPENSES, THE COMBINED TOTAL OF OPERATING COSTS (INCLUDING

OPERATING, SELLING, GENERAL, ADMINISTRATIVE, EXPLORATION, DEPRECIATION AND

DEPLETION EXPENSES FROM THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF INCOME AND EXXONMOBIL'S

SHARE OF SIMILAR COSTS FOR EQUITY COMPANIES) IN 2000 WAS $43.6 BILLION, DOWN

ABOUT $700 MILLION FROM 1999. THE IMPACT OF EFFICIENCY INITIATIVES, INCLUDING

THE CAPTURE OF MERGER SYNERGIES, REDUCED OPERATING COSTS BY $1.6 BILLION.

INTEREST EXPENSE IN 2000 WAS $589 MILLION COMPARED TO $695 MILLION IN 1999 AS

THE EFFECT OF LOWER DEBT LEVELS WAS PARTLY OFFSET BY HIGHER INTEREST RATES.

UPSTREAM

UPSTREAM EARNINGS OF $12,369 MILLION WERE A RECORD AND INCREASED DUE TO HIGHER

CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS REALIZATIONS, UP ABOUT 60 PERCENT AND 45 PERCENT,

RESPECTIVELY. LIQUIDS PRODUCTION OF 2,553 KBD INCREASED FROM 2,517 KBD IN 1999.

EXCLUDING THE EFFECTS OF LOWER ENTITLEMENTS CAUSED BY HIGHER CRUDE PRICES,

LIQUIDS PRODUCTION WAS 3 PERCENT HIGHER THAN 1999, MAINLY REFLECTING NEW

PRODUCTION FROM FIELDS IN THE NORTH SEA AND VENEZUELA AND INCREASED PRODUCTION

FROM EASTERN CANADA AND ALASKA. THESE INCREASES MORE THAN OFFSET THE EFFECTS OF

NATURAL FIELD DECLINES. NATURAL GAS PRODUCTION OF 10,343 MCFD WAS ABOUT THE SAME

AS 1999 REFLECTING HIGHER PRODUCTION IN EASTERN CANADA, EUROPE AND QATAR, OFFSET

BY LOWER PRODUCTION IN INDONESIA. EXCLUDING ENTITLEMENT IMPACTS, NATURAL GAS

PRODUCTION INCREASED ABOUT 1 PERCENT. LOWER EXPLORATION EXPENSES ALSO BENEFITED

2000 UPSTREAM EARNINGS. EARNINGS FROM U.S. UPSTREAM OPERATIONS WERE $4,545

MILLION, AN INCREASE OF $2,703 MILLION FROM 1999. EARNINGS OUTSIDE THE U.S. WERE

$7,824 MILLION, $3,899 MILLION HIGHER THAN LAST YEAR, EXCLUDING A $141 MILLION

DEFERRED TAX BENEFIT AND A $22 MILLION PROPERTY WRITE-OFF IN 1999.

DOWNSTREAM

DOWNSTREAM EARNINGS OF $3,418 MILLION IMPROVED OVER $2 BILLION FROM THE VERY

DEPRESSED RESULTS IN 1999, DRIVEN BY STRONGER WORLDWIDE REFINING MARGINS AND

BETTER REFINING OPERATIONS. EARNINGS ALSO BENEFITED FROM A PLANNED REDUCTION IN

INVENTORIES AS A RESULT OF MERGING EXXON AND MOBIL OPERATIONS AROUND THE WORLD.

PETROLEUM PRODUCT SALES OF 7,993 KBD COMPARED WITH 8,887 KBD IN 1999. THE

DECREASE REFLECTED THE EFFECTS OF THE REQUIRED DIVESTITURE OF MOBIL'S EUROPEAN

FUELS JOINT VENTURE AND OF U.S. MARKETING AND REFINING ASSETS, AS WELL AS LOWER

SUPPLY SALES IN ASIA-PACIFIC RESULTING FROM THE LOW MARGIN ENVIRONMENT. REFINERY

THROUGHPUT WAS 5,642 KBD COMPARED WITH 5,977 KBD IN 1999. EXCLUDING THE EFFECTS

OF THE DIVESTMENTS, REFINERY THROUGHPUT IN 2000 WAS AT THE SAME LEVEL AS 1999

AND PETROLEUM PRODUCT SALES WERE DOWN ABOUT 4 PERCENT. EARNINGS FROM U.S.

DOWNSTREAM OPERATIONS WERE $1,561 MILLION, UP $984 MILLION FROM THE DEPRESSED

RESULTS OF 1999, REFLECTING STRONGER REFINING MARGINS AND IMPROVED OPERATIONS,

PARTLY OFFSET BY WEAKER MARKETING MARGINS. EARNINGS OUTSIDE THE U.S. OF $1,857

MILLION WERE $1,087 MILLION HIGHER THAN 1999 AFTER EXCLUDING SPECIAL CHARGES IN

1999 IN JAPAN OF $80 MILLION FOR NON-MERGER RELATED RESTRUCTURING OF DOWNSTREAM

OPERATIONS AND A $40 MILLION WRITE-OFF ASSOCIATED WITH THE CANCELLATION OF A

POWER PROJECT. THE IMPROVEMENT WAS DRIVEN BY STRONGER EUROPEAN AND TO A MUCH

LESSER EXTENT SOUTHEAST ASIAN REFINING MARGINS AND IMPROVED REFINING OPERATIONS,

PARTLY OFFSET BY WEAKER MARKETING MARGINS.

CHEMICALS

CHEMICALS EARNINGS TOTALED $1,161 MILLION COMPARED WITH $1,354 MILLION IN 1999.

PRIME PRODUCT SALES VOLUMES OF 25,637 KT WERE UP 354 KT. THE DECLINE IN EARNINGS

WAS DRIVEN BY HIGHER FEEDSTOCK AND ENERGY COSTS AND UNFAVORABLE FOREIGN EXCHANGE

EFFECTS.

OTHER OPERATIONS

EARNINGS FROM OTHER OPERATING SEGMENTS TOTALED $551 MILLION, AN INCREASE OF $125

MILLION FROM 1999, REFLECTING RECORD COPPER AND COAL SALES, HIGHER COPPER

PRICES, LOWER OPERATING EXPENSES AND FAVORABLE FOREIGN EXCHANGE EFFECTS, PARTLY

OFFSET BY LOWER COAL PRICES.

CORPORATE AND FINANCING

CORPORATE AND FINANCING EXPENSES OF $589 MILLION COMPARED WITH $514 MILLION IN

1999. THE INCREASE RESULTED FROM UNFAVORABLE FOREIGN EXCHANGE EFFECTS AND LOWER

TAX-RELATED BENEFITS, PARTLY OFFSET BY A REDUCTION IN ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES AS

A RESULT OF COMBINING EXXON AND MOBIL HEADQUARTERS OPERATIONS. THE EFFECT OF

LOWER DEBT LEVELS WAS PARTLY OFFSET BY HIGHER INTEREST RATES DURING THE YEAR.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

IN 2001, CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES TOTALED $22.9 BILLION, THE SAME

LEVEL AS 2000. MAJOR SOURCES OF FUNDS WERE NET INCOME OF $15.3 BILLION AND

NON-CASH PROVISIONS OF $7.9 BILLION FOR DEPRECIATION AND DEPLETION.

CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES TOTALED $8.2 BILLION, UP $4.9 BILLION

FROM 2000 DUE TO LOWER PROCEEDS FROM SALES OF SUBSIDIARIES, INVESTMENTS AND

PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT RESULTING FROM THE ABSENCE OF THE ASSET

DIVESTITURES IN 2000 THAT WERE REQUIRED AS A CONDITION OF THE REGULATORY

APPROVAL OF THE MERGER, AND DUE TO HIGHER ADDITIONS TO PROPERTY, PLANT AND

EQUIPMENT.

CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES WAS $15.0 BILLION, UP $0.9 BILLION,

DRIVEN BY HIGHER PURCHASES OF COMMON SHARES, OFFSET BY LOWER DEBT REDUCTIONS.

DIVIDEND PAYMENTS ON COMMON SHARES INCREASED FROM $0.88 PER SHARE TO $0.91 PER

SHARE AND TOTALED $6.3 BILLION, A PAYOUT OF 41 PERCENT. TOTAL CONSOLIDATED

SHORT-TERM AND LONG-TERM DEBT DECLINED BY $2.6 BILLION TO $10.8 BILLION.

SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY INCREASED BY $2.4 BILLION TO $73.2 BILLION.

DURING 2001, EXXON MOBIL CORPORATION PURCHASED 139 MILLION SHARES OF ITS

COMMON STOCK FOR THE TREASURY AT A GROSS COST OF $5,721 MILLION. THESE PURCHASES

WERE TO OFFSET SHARES ISSUED IN CONJUNCTION WITH COMPANY BENEFIT PLANS AND

PROGRAMS AND TO REDUCE THE NUMBER OF SHARES OUTSTANDING. SHARES OUTSTANDING WERE

REDUCED FROM 6,930 MILLION AT THE END OF 2000 TO 6,809 MILLION AT THE END OF

2001. PURCHASES WERE MADE IN BOTH THE OPEN MARKET AND THROUGH NEGOTIATED

TRANSACTIONS, AND MAY BE DISCONTINUED AT ANY TIME.

IN 2000, CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES TOTALED $22.9 BILLION, UP

$7.9 BILLION FROM 1999. MAJOR SOURCES OF FUNDS WERE NET INCOME OF $17.7 BILLION

AND NON-CASH PROVISIONS OF $8.1 BILLION FOR DEPRECIATION AND DEPLETION.

CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES TOTALED $3.3 BILLION, DOWN $7.7 BILLION

FROM 1999 DUE TO HIGHER PROCEEDS FROM SALES OF SUBSIDIARIES, INVESTMENTS AND

PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT RESULTING FROM ASSET DIVESTITURES THAT WERE

REQUIRED AS A CONDITION OF THE REGULATORY APPROVAL OF THE MERGER, AND DUE TO

LOWER ADDITIONS TO PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT.

CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES WAS $14.2 BILLION, UP $9.4 BILLION,

DRIVEN BY DEBT REDUCTIONS IN THE CURRENT YEAR VERSUS DEBT INCREASES IN 1999,

ALONG WITH HIGHER PURCHASES OF COMMON SHARES. DIVIDEND PAYMENTS ON COMMON SHARES

INCREASED FROM $0.844 PER SHARE TO $0.880 PER SHARE AND TOTALED $6.1 BILLION, A

PAYOUT OF 35 PERCENT. TOTAL CONSOLIDATED SHORT-TERM AND LONG-TERM DEBT DECLINED

BY $5.6 BILLION TO $13.4 BILLION. SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY INCREASED BY $7.3 BILLION

TO $70.8 BILLION.

PRIOR TO THE MERGER, THE CORPORATION PURCHASED SHARES OF ITS COMMON STOCK

FOR THE TREASURY. CONSISTENT WITH POOLING ACCOUNTING REQUIREMENTS, THIS

REPURCHASE PROGRAM WAS TERMINATED EFFECTIVE WITH THE CLOSE OF THE EXXONMOBIL

MERGER ON NOVEMBER 30, 1999. ON AUGUST 1, 2000, THE CORPORATION ANNOUNCED ITS

INTENTION TO PURCHASE SHARES OF ITS COMMON STOCK. DURING 2000, EXXON MOBIL

CORPORATION PURCHASED 54 MILLION SHARES OF ITS COMMON STOCK FOR THE TREASURY AT

A GROSS COST OF $2,352 MILLION. THESE PURCHASES WERE TO OFFSET SHARES ISSUED IN

CONJUNCTION WITH COMPANY BENEFIT PLANS AND PROGRAMS AND TO REDUCE THE NUMBER OF

SHARES OUTSTANDING. SHARES OUTSTANDING WERE REDUCED FROM 6,955 MILLION AT THE

END OF 1999 TO 6,930 MILLION AT THE END OF 2000. PURCHASES WERE MADE IN BOTH THE

OPEN MARKET AND THROUGH NEGOTIATED TRANSACTIONS.

ALTHOUGH THE CORPORATION ISSUES LONG-TERM DEBT FROM TIME TO TIME AND

MAINTAINS A REVOLVING COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAM, INTERNALLY GENERATED FUNDS COVER

THE MAJORITY OF ITS FINANCIAL REQUIREMENTS. THE MANAGEMENT OF CASH THAT MAY BE

TEMPORARILY AVAILABLE AS SURPLUS TO THE CORPORATIONS IMMEDIATE NEEDS IS

CAREFULLY CONTROLLED, BOTH TO OPTIMIZE RETURNS ON CASH BALANCES, AND TO ENSURE

ITS SECURE, READY AVAILABILITY TO MEET THE CORPORATIONS' CASH REQUIREMENTS AS

THEY ARISE.

LONG-TERM CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND

GAS RESOURCES IN MALAYSIA. THE CORPORATION EXPECTS TO FUND THE MAJORITY OF THESE

COMMITMENTS THROUGH INTERNAL CASH FLOW.

OTHER COMMERCIAL COMMITMENTS

THE CORPORATION AND CERTAIN OF ITS CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES WERE CONTINGENTLY

LIABLE AT DECEMBER 31, 2001, FOR $3,921 MILLION, PRIMARILY RELATING TO

GUARANTEES FOR NOTES, LOANS AND PERFORMANCE UNDER CONTRACTS (NOTE 17). THIS

INCLUDED $672 MILLION REPRESENTING GUARANTEES OF NON-U.S. EXCISE TAXES AND

CUSTOMS DUTIES OF OTHER COMPANIES, ENTERED INTO AS A NORMAL BUSINESS PRACTICE,

UNDER RECIPROCAL ARRANGEMENTS. ALSO INCLUDED IN THIS AMOUNT WERE GUARANTEES BY

CONSOLIDATED AFFILIATES OF $1,641 MILLION, REPRESENTING EXXONMOBIL'S SHARE OF

OBLIGATIONS OF CERTAIN EQUITY COMPANIES.

ON DECEMBER 31, 2001, UNUSED CREDIT LINES FOR SHORT-TERM FINANCING TOTALED

APPROXIMATELY $5.3 BILLION (NOTE 7).

THE TABLE BELOW SHOWS THE CORPORATION'S FIXED CHARGE COVERAGE AND

CONSOLIDATED DEBT TO CAPITAL RATIOS. THE DATA DEMONSTRATE THE CORPORATIONS

MANAGEMENT VIEWS THE CORPORATION'S FINANCIAL STRENGTH, AS EVIDENCED BY THE

ABOVE FINANCIAL RATIOS AND OTHER SIMILAR MEASURES, TO BE A COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE

OF STRATEGIC IMPORTANCE. THE CORPORATION'S SOUND FINANCIAL POSITION GIVES IT THE

OPPORTUNITY TO ACCESS THE WORLD'S CAPITAL MARKETS IN THE FULL RANGE OF MARKET

CONDITIONS, AND ENABLES THE CORPORATION TO TAKE ON LARGE, LONG-TERM CAPITAL

COMMITMENTS IN THE PURSUIT OF MAXIMIZING SHAREHOLDER VALUE.

IN ADDITION TO THE ABOVE COMMITMENTS, THE CORPORATION MAKES LIMITED USE OF

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS, WHICH ARE DISCUSSED IN RISK MANAGEMENT ON PAGE 29 AND

NOTE 14 ON PAGE 44.

LITIGATION AND OTHER CONTINGENCIES

AS DISCUSSED IN NOTE 17 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, A NUMBER OF

LAWSUITS, INCLUDING CLASS ACTIONS, WERE BROUGHT IN VARIOUS COURTS AGAINST EXXON

MOBIL CORPORATION AND CERTAIN OF ITS SUBSIDIARIES RELATING TO THE ACCIDENTAL

RELEASE OF CRUDE OIL FROM THE TANKER EXXON VALDEZ IN 1989. THE VAST MAJORITY OF

THE CLAIMS HAVE BEEN RESOLVED LEAVING A FEW COMPENSATORY DAMAGES CASES TO BE

TRIED. ALL OF THE PUNITIVE DAMAGE CLAIMS WERE CONSOLIDATED IN THE CIVIL TRIAL

THAT BEGAN IN MAY 1994.

IN THAT TRIAL, ON SEPTEMBER 24, 1996, THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR

THE DISTRICT OF ALASKA ENTERED A JUDGMENT IN THE AMOUNT OF $5.058 BILLION. THE

DISTRICT COURT AWARDED APPROXIMATELY $19.6 MILLION IN COMPENSATORY DAMAGES TO

FISHER PLAINTIFFS, $38 MILLION IN PREJUDGMENT INTEREST ON THE COMPENSATORY

DAMAGES AND $5 BILLION IN PUNITIVE DAMAGES TO A CLASS COMPOSED OF ALL PERSONS

AND ENTITIES WHO ASSERTED CLAIMS FOR PUNITIVE DAMAGES FROM THE CORPORATION AS A

RESULT OF THE EXXON VALDEZ GROUNDING. THE DISTRICT COURT ALSO ORDERED THAT THESE

AWARDS SHALL BEAR INTEREST FROM AND AFTER ENTRY OF THE JUDGMENT. THE DISTRICT

COURT STAYED EXECUTION ON THE JUDGMENT PENDING APPEAL BASED ON A $6.75 BILLION

LETTER OF CREDIT POSTED BY THE CORPORATION. EXXONMOBIL APPEALED THE JUDGMENT. ON

NOVEMBER 7, 2001, THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT

VACATED THE PUNITIVE DAMAGE AWARD AS BEING EXCESSIVE UNDER THE CONSTITUTION AND

REMANDED THE CASE TO THE DISTRICT COURT FOR IT TO DETERMINE THE AMOUNT OF THE

PUNITIVE DAMAGE AWARD CONSISTENT WITH THE NINTH CIRCUIT'S HOLDING. THE NINTH

CIRCUIT UPHELD THE COMPENSATORY DAMAGE AWARD WHICH HAS BEEN PAID. THE LETTER OF

CREDIT WAS TERMINATED ON FEBRUARY 1, 2002. THE ULTIMATE COST TO THE CORPORATION

FROM THE LAWSUITS ARISING FROM THE EXXON VALDEZ GROUNDING IS NOT POSSIBLE TO

PREDICT AND MAY NOT BE RESOLVED FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS.

ON DECEMBER 19, 2000, A JURY IN MONTGOMERY COUNTY, ALABAMA, RETURNED A

VERDICT AGAINST THE CORPORATION IN A CONTRACT DISPUTE OVER ROYALTIES IN THE

AMOUNT OF $87.69 MILLION IN COMPENSATORY DAMAGES AND $3.42 BILLION IN PUNITIVE

DAMAGES IN THE CASE OF EXXON CORPORATION V. STATE OF ALABAMA, ET AL. THE VERDICT

WAS UPHELD BY THE TRIAL COURT ON MAY 4, 2001. EXXONMOBIL HAS APPEALED THE

JUDGMENT AND BELIEVES IT SHOULD BE SET ASIDE OR SUBSTANTIALLY REDUCED ON FACTUAL

AND CONSTITUTIONAL GROUNDS. THE ULTIMATE OUTCOME IS NOT EXPECTED TO HAVE A

MATERIALLY ADVERSE EFFECT UPON THE CORPORATION'S OPERATIONS OR FINANCIAL

CONDITION.

ON MAY 22, 2001, A STATE COURT JURY IN NEW ORLEANS, LOUISIANA, RETURNED A

VERDICT AGAINST THE CORPORATION AND THREE OTHER ENTITIES IN A CASE BROUGHT BY A

LANDOWNER CLAIMING DAMAGE TO HIS PROPERTY. THE PROPERTY HAD BEEN LEASED BY THE

LANDOWNER TO A COMPANY THAT PERFORMED PIPE CLEANING AND STORAGE SERVICES FOR

CUSTOMERS, INCLUDING THE CORPORATION. THE JURY AWARDED THE PLAINTIFF $56 MILLION

IN COMPENSATORY DAMAGES (90 PERCENT TO BE PAID BY THE CORPORATION) AND $1

BILLION IN PUNITIVE DAMAGES (ALL TO BE PAID BY THE CORPORATION). THE DAMAGE

RELATED TO THE PRESENCE OF NATURALLY OCCURRING RADIOACTIVE MATERIAL (NORM) ON

THE SITE RESULTING FROM PIPE CLEANING OPERATIONS. THE AWARD HAS BEEN UPHELD AT

THE TRIAL COURT. EXXONMOBIL WILL APPEAL THE JUDGMENT TO THE LOUISIANA FOURTH

CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS AND BELIEVES THAT THE JUDGMENT SHOULD BE SET ASIDE OR

SUBSTANTIALLY REDUCED ON FACTUAL AND CONSTITUTIONAL GROUNDS. THE ULTIMATE

OUTCOME IS NOT EXPECTED TO HAVE A MATERIALLY ADVERSE EFFECT UPON THE

CORPORATION'S OPERATIONS OR FINANCIAL CONDITION.

THE U.S. TAX COURT HAS DECIDED THE ISSUE WITH RESPECT TO THE PRICING OF

CRUDE OIL PURCHASED FROM SAUDI ARABIA FOR THE YEARS 1979-1981 IN FAVOR OF THE

CORPORATION. THIS DECISION IS SUBJECT TO APPEAL. CERTAIN OTHER ISSUES FOR THE

YEARS 1979-1993 REMAIN PENDING BEFORE THE TAX COURT. THE ULTIMATE RESOLUTION OF

THESE ISSUES AND SEVERAL OTHER TAX AND LEGAL ISSUES, INCLUDING RESOLUTION OF TAX

ISSUES RELATED TO THE GAS LIFTING IMBALANCE ALONG THE GERMAN/DUTCH BORDER, IS

NOT EXPECTED TO HAVE A MATERIALLY ADVERSE EFFECT UPON THE CORPORATION'S

OPERATIONS OR FINANCIAL CONDITION.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS

THERE ARE NO EVENTS OR UNCERTAINTIES KNOWN TO MANAGEMENT BEYOND THOSE

ALREADY INCLUDED IN REPORTED FINANCIAL INFORMATION THAT WOULD INDICATE A

MATERIAL CHANGE IN FUTURE OPERATING RESULTS OR FINANCIAL CONDITION.

CAPITAL AND EXPLORATION EXPENDITURES

CAPITAL AND EXPLORATION EXPENDITURES IN 2001 WERE $12.3 BILLION, UP FROM $11.2

BILLION IN 2000, REFLECTING THE CORPORATION'S ACTIVE INVESTMENT PROGRAM.

UPSTREAM SPENDING WAS UP 27 PERCENT TO $8.8 BILLION IN 2001, FROM $6.9

BILLION IN 2000, AS A RESULT OF HIGHER SPENDING ON MAJOR PROJECTS IN AFRICA, THE

NORTH SEA, AND CANADA, AND INCREASED DRILLING ACTIVITY. CAPITAL INVESTMENTS IN

THE DOWNSTREAM TOTALED $2.3 BILLION IN 2001, DOWN $0.3 BILLION FROM 2000,

PRIMARILY REFLECTING TIMING OF INVESTMENTS IN CHINA PARTLY OFFSET BY INCREASED

SPENDING IN THE RETAIL BUSINESSES. CHEMICALS CAPITAL EXPENDITURES WERE $0.9

BILLION IN 2001, DOWN FROM $1.5 BILLION IN 2000, DUE TO THE COMPLETION OF MAJOR

PROJECTS IN SINGAPORE AND SAUDI ARABIA, AND TIMING OF INVESTMENT IN CHINA.

CAPITAL AND EXPLORATION EXPENDITURES IN THE U.S. TOTALED $3.9 BILLION IN

2001, AN INCREASE OF $0.6 BILLION FROM 2000, REFLECTING HIGHER SPENDING IN BOTH

THE UPSTREAM AND CHEMICALS, PARTLY OFFSET BY LOWER SPENDING IN THE DOWNSTREAM.

SPENDING OUTSIDE THE U.S. OF $8.4 BILLION IN 2001 WAS UP $0.5 BILLION FROM 2000,

REFLECTING HIGHER EXPENDITURES IN THE UPSTREAM, PARTLY OFFSET BY LOWER

EXPENDITURES IN THE DOWNSTREAM AND CHEMICALS.

MERGER OF EXXON CORPORATION AND MOBIL CORPORATION

ON NOVEMBER 30, 1999, A WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARY OF EXXON CORPORATION (EXXON)

MERGED WITH MOBIL CORPORATION (MOBIL) SO THAT MOBIL BECAME A WHOLLY-OWNED

SUBSIDIARY OF EXXON (THE "MERGER"). AT THE SAME TIME, EXXON CHANGED ITS NAME TO

EXXON MOBIL CORPORATION (EXXONMOBIL). UNDER THE TERMS OF THE AGREEMENT,

APPROXIMATELY 1.0 BILLION SHARES OF EXXONMOBIL COMMON STOCK WERE ISSUED IN

EXCHANGE FOR ALL THE OUTSTANDING SHARES OF MOBIL COMMON STOCK BASED UPON AN

EXCHANGE RATIO OF 1.32015. FOLLOWING THE EXCHANGE, FORMER SHAREHOLDERS OF EXXON

OWNED APPROXIMATELY 70 PERCENT OF THE CORPORATION, WHILE FORMER MOBIL

SHAREHOLDERS OWNED APPROXIMATELY 30 PERCENT OF THE CORPORATION. EACH OUTSTANDING

SHARE OF MOBIL PREFERRED STOCK WAS CONVERTED INTO ONE SHARE OF A NEW CLASS OF

EXXONMOBIL PREFERRED STOCK.

AS A RESULT OF THE MERGER, THE ACCOUNTS OF CERTAIN DOWNSTREAM AND CHEMICALS

OPERATIONS JOINTLY CONTROLLED BY THE COMBINING COMPANIES HAVE BEEN INCLUDED IN

THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. THESE OPERATIONS WERE PREVIOUSLY

ACCOUNTED FOR BY EXXON AND MOBIL AS SEPARATE COMPANIES USING THE EQUITY METHOD

OF ACCOUNTING.

THE MERGER WAS ACCOUNTED FOR AS A POOLING OF INTERESTS. ACCORDINGLY, THE

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GIVE RETROACTIVE EFFECT TO THE MERGER, WITH

ALL PERIODS PRESENTED AS IF EXXON AND MOBIL HAD ALWAYS BEEN COMBINED.

AS A CONDITION OF THE APPROVAL OF THE MERGER, THE U.S. FEDERAL TRADE

COMMISSION AND THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION REQUIRED THAT CERTAIN PROPERTY PRIMARILY

DOWNSTREAM, PIPELINE AND NATURAL GAS DISTRIBUTION ASSETS BE DIVESTED. THE

CARRYING VALUE OF THESE ASSETS WAS APPROXIMATELY $3 BILLION AND BEFORE-TAX

PROCEEDS WERE APPROXIMATELY $5 BILLION. NET AFTER-TAX GAINS OF $40 MILLION AND

$1,730 MILLION WERE REPORTED IN 2001 AND 2000, RESPECTIVELY, AS EXTRAORDINARY

ITEMS CONSISTENT WITH POOLING OF INTERESTS ACCOUNTING REQUIREMENTS. THE DIVESTED

PROPERTIES HISTORICALLY EARNED APPROXIMATELY $200 MILLION PER YEAR.

MERGER EXPENSES AND REORGANIZATION RESERVES

IN ASSOCIATION WITH THE MERGER BETWEEN EXXON AND MOBIL, $748 MILLION PRE-TAX

($525 MILLION AFTER-TAX), $1,406 MILLION PRE-TAX ($920 MILLION AFTER-TAX) AND

$625 MILLION PRE-TAX ($469 MILLION AFTER-TAX) OF COSTS WERE RECORDED AS

MERGER-RELATED EXPENSES IN 2001, 2000 AND 1999, RESPECTIVELY. CHARGES INCLUDED

SEPARATION EXPENSES RELATED TO WORKFORCE REDUCTIONS (APPROXIMATELY 8,000

EMPLOYEES AT YEAR-END 2001), PLUS IMPLEMENTATION AND MERGER CLOSING COSTS. THE

SEPARATION RESERVE BALANCE AT YEAR-END 2001 OF APPROXIMATELY $197 MILLION IS

EXPECTED TO BE EXPENDED IN 2002. MERGER-RELATED EXPENSES ARE EXPECTED TO GROW TO

APPROXIMATELY $2.9 BILLION PRE-TAX ON A CUMULATIVE BASIS BY THE END OF 2002.

PRE-TAX OPERATING SYNERGIES ASSOCIATED WITH THE MERGER, WHICH ARE ON TRACK WITH

EXPECTATIONS, INCLUDING COST SAVINGS, EFFICIENCY GAINS, AND REVENUE

ENHANCEMENTS, ARE EXPECTED TO REACH APPROXIMATELY $7 BILLION PER YEAR BY 2002.

IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 1999, THE CORPORATION RECORDED A $120 MILLION

AFTER-TAX CHARGE FOR THE NON-MERGER RELATED REORGANIZATION OF JAPANESE

DOWNSTREAM OPERATIONS IN ITS WHOLLY-OWNED ESSO SEKIYU K.K. AND 50.1 PERCENT

OWNED GENERAL SEKIYU K.K. AFFILIATES. THE REORGANIZATION RESULTED IN THE

REDUCTION OF APPROXIMATELY 700 ADMINISTRATIVE, FINANCIAL, LOGISTICS AND

MARKETING SERVICE EMPLOYEE POSITIONS. THE JAPANESE AFFILIATES RECORDED A

COMBINED CHARGE OF $216 MILLION (BEFORE-TAX) TO SELLING, GENERAL AND

ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES FOR THE EMPLOYEE RELATED COSTS. SUBSTANTIALLY ALL CASH

EXPENDITURES ANTICIPATED IN THE RESTRUCTURING PROVISION WERE PAID IN 1999.

GENERAL SEKIYU ALSO RECORDED A $211 MILLION (BEFORE-TAX) CHARGE TO DEPRECIATION

AND DEPLETION FOR THE WRITE-OFF OF COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE CANCELLATION OF A

POWER PLANT PROJECT AT THE KAWASAKI TERMINAL. WORKFORCE REDUCTION SAVINGS

ASSOCIATED WITH THIS REORGANIZATION ARE APPROXIMATELY $50 MILLION PER YEAR

AFTER-TAX.

THE FOLLOWING TABLE SUMMARIZES THE ACTIVITY IN THE REORGANIZATION RESERVES.

SITE RESTORATION AND OTHER ENVIRONMENTAL COSTS

OVER THE YEARS THE CORPORATION HAS ACCRUED PROVISIONS FOR ESTIMATED SITE

RESTORATION COSTS TO BE INCURRED AT THE END OF THE OPERATING LIFE OF CERTAIN OF

ITS FACILITIES AND PROPERTIES. IN ADDITION, THE CORPORATION ACCRUES PROVISIONS

FOR ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES IN THE MANY COUNTRIES IN WHICH IT DOES BUSINESS

WHEN IT IS PROBABLE THAT OBLIGATIONS HAVE BEEN INCURRED AND THE AMOUNTS CAN BE

REASONABLY ESTIMATED. THIS POLICY APPLIES TO ASSETS OR BUSINESSES CURRENTLY

OWNED OR PREVIOUSLY DISPOSED.

THE CORPORATION HAS ACCRUED PROVISIONS FOR PROBABLE ENVIRONMENTAL

REMEDIATION OBLIGATIONS AT VARIOUS SITES, INCLUDING MULTI-PARTY SITES WHERE

EXXONMOBIL HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED AS ONE OF THE POTENTIALLY RESPONSIBLE PARTIES BY

THE U.S. ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY. THE INVOLVEMENT OF OTHER FINANCIALLY

RESPONSIBLE COMPANIES AT THESE MULTI-PARTY SITES MITIGATES EXXONMOBILS ACTUAL

JOINT AND SEVERAL LIABILITY EXPOSURE. AT PRESENT, NO INDIVIDUAL SITE IS EXPECTED

TO HAVE LOSSES MATERIAL TO EXXONMOBIL'S OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL CONDITION OR

LIQUIDITY.

CHARGES MADE AGAINST INCOME FOR SITE RESTORATION AND ENVIRONMENTAL

LIABILITIES WERE $371 MILLION IN 2001, $311 MILLION IN 2000 AND $219 MILLION IN

1999. AT THE END OF 2001, ACCUMULATED SITE RESTORATION AND ENVIRONMENTAL

PROVISIONS, AFTER REDUCTION FOR AMOUNTS PAID, AMOUNTED TO $3.7 BILLION.

EXXONMOBIL BELIEVES THAT ANY COST IN EXCESS OF THE AMOUNTS ALREADY PROVIDED FOR

IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS WOULD NOT HAVE A MATERIALLY ADVERSE EFFECT UPON THE

CORPORATION'S OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL CONDITION OR LIQUIDITY.

EXXONMOBIL'S WORLDWIDE ENVIRONMENTAL COSTS IN 2001 TOTALED $1,782 MILLION

OF WHICH $505 MILLION WERE CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND $1,277 MILLION WERE

OPERATING COSTS (INCLUDING THE $371 MILLION OF SITE RESTORATION AND

ENVIRONMENTAL PROVISIONS NOTED ABOVE). THESE COSTS WERE MOSTLY ASSOCIATED WITH

AIR AND WATER CONSERVATION. TOTAL COSTS FOR SUCH ACTIVITIES ARE EXPECTED TO

INCREASE TO ABOUT $2.5 BILLION IN BOTH 2002 AND 2003 (WITH CAPITAL EXPENDITURES

REPRESENTING ABOUT 50 PERCENT OF THE TOTAL). THE PROJECTED INCREASE IS PRIMARILY

FOR CAPITAL PROJECTS TO IMPLEMENT REFINING TECHNOLOGY TO MANUFACTURE LOW-SULFUR

MOTOR FUELS IN MANY PARTS OF THE WORLD.

TAXES

INCOME, EXCISE AND ALL OTHER TAXES AND DUTIES TOTALED $66.6 BILLION IN 2001, A

DECREASE OF $1.8 BILLION OR 3 PERCENT FROM 2000. INCOME TAX EXPENSE, BOTH

CURRENT AND DEFERRED, WAS $9.0 BILLION COMPARED TO $11.1 BILLION IN 2000,

REFLECTING LOWER PRE-TAX INCOME IN 2001. THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE OF 39.3 PERCENT

IN 2001 COMPARED TO 42.4 PERCENT IN 2000, BENEFITING FROM A HIGHER LEVEL OF

FAVORABLY RESOLVED TAX-RELATED ISSUES. EXCISE AND ALL OTHER TAXES AND DUTIES

WERE $57.6 BILLION.

INCOME, EXCISE AND ALL OTHER TAXES AND DUTIES TOTALED $68.4 BILLION IN

2000, AN INCREASE OF $6.9 BILLION OR 11 PERCENT FROM 1999. INCOME TAX EXPENSE,

BOTH CURRENT AND DEFERRED, WAS $11.1 BILLION COMPARED TO $3.2 BILLION IN 1999,

REFLECTING HIGHER PRE-TAX INCOME IN 2000. THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE INCREASED FROM

31.8 PERCENT IN 1999 TO 42.4 PERCENT IN 2000 AS A RESULT OF A LARGER SHARE OF

TOTAL EARNINGS COMING FROM THE MORE HIGHLY TAXED NON-U.S. UPSTREAM SEGMENT AND

LOWER BENEFITS FROM RESOLUTION OF TAX-RELATED ISSUES. EXCISE AND ALL OTHER TAXES

AND DUTIES DECREASED $1.0 BILLION TO $57.3 BILLION.

MARKET RISKS, INFLATION AND OTHER UNCERTAINTIES

IN THE PAST, CRUDE, NATURAL GAS, PETROLEUM PRODUCT AND CHEMICAL PRICES HAVE

FLUCTUATED WIDELY IN RESPONSE TO CHANGING MARKET FORCES. THE IMPACTS OF THESE

PRICE FLUCTUATIONS ON EARNINGS FROM UPSTREAM OPERATIONS, DOWNSTREAM OPERATIONS

AND CHEMICALS OPERATIONS HAVE BEEN VARIED, TENDING AT TIMES TO BE OFFSETTING.

NONETHELESS, THE GLOBAL ENERGY MARKETS CAN GIVE RISE TO EXTENDED PERIODS IN

WHICH MARKET CONDITIONS ARE ADVERSE TO ONE OR MORE OF THE CORPORATION'S

BUSINESSES. SUCH CONDITIONS, ALONG WITH THE CAPITAL INTENSIVE NATURE OF THE

INDUSTRY AND VERY LONG LEAD TIMES ASSOCIATED WITH MANY OF OUR PROJECTS,

UNDERSCORE THE IMPORTANCE OF MAINTAINING A STRONG FINANCIAL POSITION. MANAGEMENT

VIEWS THE CORPORATION'S FINANCIAL STRENGTH, INCLUDING THE AAA AND AAA RATINGS OF

ITS LONG-TERM DEBT SECURITIES BY STANDARD AND POOR'S AND MOODY'S, AS A

COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE.

ALTHOUGH PRICE LEVELS OF CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS WILL OCCASIONALLY SPIKE

UPWARDS OR DROP PRECIPITOUSLY, INDUSTRY PRICES OVER THE LONG TERM WILL CONTINUE

TO BE DRIVEN BY MARKET SUPPLY AND DEMAND FUNDAMENTALS. ACCORDINGLY, THE

CORPORATION TESTS THE VIABILITY OF ITS OIL AND GAS OPERATIONS BASED ON LONG-TERM

PRICE PROJECTIONS. THE CORPORATION'S ASSESSMENT IS THAT ITS OPERATIONS WILL

CONTINUE TO BE SUCCESSFUL IN A VARIETY OF MARKET CONDITIONS. THIS IS THE OUTCOME

OF DISCIPLINED INVESTMENT AND ASSET MANAGEMENT PROGRAMS. INVESTMENT

OPPORTUNITIES ARE TESTED AGAINST A VARIETY OF MARKET CONDITIONS, INCLUDING LOW

PRICE SCENARIOS. AS A RESULT, INVESTMENTS THAT WOULD SUCCEED ONLY IN HIGHLY

FAVORABLE PRICE ENVIRONMENTS ARE SCREENED OUT OF THE INVESTMENT PLAN.

THE CORPORATION HAS HAD AN ACTIVE ASSET MANAGEMENT PROGRAM IN WHICH

UNDER-PERFORMING ASSETS ARE EITHER IMPROVED TO ACCEPTABLE LEVELS OR CONSIDERED

FOR DIVESTMENT. THE ASSET MANAGEMENT PROGRAM INVOLVES A DISCIPLINED, REGULAR

REVIEW TO ENSURE THAT ALL ASSETS ARE CONTRIBUTING TO THE CORPORATION'S STRATEGIC

AND FINANCIAL OBJECTIVES. THE RESULT HAS BEEN THE CREATION OF A VERY EFFICIENT

CAPITAL BASE AND HAS MEANT THAT THE CORPORATION HAS SELDOM BEEN REQUIRED TO

WRITE-DOWN THE CARRYING VALUE OF ASSETS, EVEN DURING PERIODS OF LOW COMMODITY

PRICES.

RISK MANAGEMENT

THE CORPORATION'S SIZE, GEOGRAPHIC DIVERSITY AND THE COMPLEMENTARY NATURE OF THE

UPSTREAM, DOWNSTREAM AND CHEMICALS BUSINESSES MITIGATE THE CORPORATION'S RISK

FROM CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES, CURRENCY RATES AND COMMODITY PRICES. THE

CORPORATION RELIES ON THESE OPERATING ATTRIBUTES AND STRENGTHS TO REDUCE

ENTERPRISE-WIDE RISK. AS A RESULT, THE CORPORATION MAKES LIMITED USE OF

DERIVATIVES TO OFFSET EXPOSURES ARISING FROM EXISTING TRANSACTIONS.

THE CORPORATION DOES NOT TRADE IN DERIVATIVES NOR DOES IT USE DERIVATIVES

WITH LEVERAGE FEATURES. THE CORPORATION MAINTAINS A SYSTEM OF CONTROLS THAT

INCLUDES A POLICY COVERING THE AUTHORIZATION, REPORTING, AND MONITORING OF

DERIVATIVE ACTIVITY. THE CORPORATION'S DERIVATIVE ACTIVITIES POSE NO MATERIAL

CREDIT OR MARKET RISKS TO EXXONMOBIL'S OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL CONDITION OR

LIQUIDITY. INTEREST RATE, FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATE AND COMMODITY PRICE EXPOSURES

ARISING FROM DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS UNDERTAKEN IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE

CORPORATION'S POLICIES HAVE NOT BEEN SIGNIFICANT.

29

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS

THE FAIR VALUE OF DERIVATIVES OUTSTANDING AND RECORDED ON THE BALANCE SHEET

AT DECEMBER 31, 2001 WAS $50 MILLION BEFORE-TAX. THIS IS THE AMOUNT THAT THE

CORPORATION WOULD HAVE HAD TO PAY TO THIRD PARTIES IF THESE DERIVATIVES HAD BEEN

SETTLED AT YEAR-END. THESE DERIVATIVE FAIR VALUES WERE SUBSTANTIALLY OFFSET BY

THE FAIR VALUES OF THE UNDERLYING EXPOSURES BEING HEDGED. DURING 2001, THE

CORPORATION RECOGNIZED A BEFORE-TAX GAIN OF $23 MILLION RELATED TO DERIVATIVE

ACTIVITY. THIS GAIN INCLUDED THE OFFSETTING AMOUNTS FROM THE CHANGES IN FAIR

VALUE OF THE ITEMS BEING HEDGED BY THE DERIVATIVES. THE FAIR VALUE OF

DERIVATIVES OUTSTANDING AT YEAR-END AND GAINS RECOGNIZED DURING THE YEAR ARE

IMMATERIAL IN RELATION TO THE CORPORATION'S YEAR-END CASH BALANCE OF $6.5

BILLION, TOTAL ASSETS OF $143.2 BILLION, OR NET INCOME FOR THE YEAR OF $15.3

BILLION.

DEBT-RELATED INSTRUMENTS

THE CORPORATION IS EXPOSED TO CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES, PRIMARILY AS A RESULT

OF ITS SHORT-TERM DEBT AND LONG-TERM DEBT CARRYING FLOATING INTEREST RATES. THE

CORPORATION MAKES LIMITED USE OF INTEREST RATE SWAP AGREEMENTS TO ADJUST THE

RATIO OF FIXED AND FLOATING RATES IN THE DEBT PORTFOLIO. THE IMPACT OF A 100

BASIS POINT CHANGE IN INTEREST RATES AFFECTING THE CORPORATION'S DEBT WOULD NOT

BE MATERIAL TO EARNINGS, CASH FLOW OR FAIR VALUE.

FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE INSTRUMENTS

THE CORPORATION CONDUCTS BUSINESS IN MANY FOREIGN CURRENCIES AND IS SUBJECT TO

FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE RISK ON CASH FLOWS RELATED TO SALES, EXPENSES,

FINANCING AND INVESTMENT TRANSACTIONS. THE IMPACTS OF FLUCTUATIONS IN FOREIGN

CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES ON EXXONMOBIL'S GEOGRAPHICALLY DIVERSE OPERATIONS ARE

VARIED AND OFTEN OFFSETTING IN AMOUNT. THE CORPORATION MAKES LIMITED USE OF

CURRENCY EXCHANGE CONTRACTS TO REDUCE THE RISK OF ADVERSE FOREIGN CURRENCY

MOVEMENTS RELATED TO CERTAIN FOREIGN CURRENCY DEBT OBLIGATIONS. EXPOSURE FROM

MARKET RATE FLUCTUATIONS RELATED TO THESE CONTRACTS IS NOT MATERIAL. AGGREGATE

FOREIGN EXCHANGE TRANSACTION GAINS AND LOSSES INCLUDED IN NET INCOME ARE

DISCUSSED IN NOTE 5 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

COMMODITY INSTRUMENTS

THE CORPORATION MAKES LIMITED USE OF COMMODITY FORWARDS, SWAPS AND FUTURES

CONTRACTS OF SHORT DURATION TO MITIGATE THE RISK OF UNFAVORABLE PRICE MOVEMENTS

ON CERTAIN CRUDE, NATURAL GAS AND PETROLEUM PRODUCT PURCHASES AND SALES.

COMMODITY PRICE EXPOSURE RELATED TO THESE CONTRACTS IS NOT MATERIAL.

INFLATION AND OTHER UNCERTAINTIES

THE GENERAL RATE OF INFLATION IN MOST MAJOR COUNTRIES OF OPERATION HAS BEEN

RELATIVELY LOW IN RECENT YEARS, AND THE ASSOCIATED IMPACT ON OPERATING COSTS HAS

BEEN COUNTERED BY COST REDUCTIONS FROM EFFICIENCY AND PRODUCTIVITY IMPROVEMENTS.

THE OPERATIONS AND EARNINGS OF THE CORPORATION AND ITS AFFILIATES

THROUGHOUT THE WORLD HAVE BEEN, AND MAY IN THE FUTURE BE, AFFECTED FROM TIME TO

TIME IN VARYING DEGREE BY POLITICAL DEVELOPMENTS AND LAWS AND REGULATIONS, SUCH

AS FORCED DIVESTITURE OF ASSETS; RESTRICTIONS ON PRODUCTION; IMPORTS AND

EXPORTS; PRICE CONTROLS; TAX INCREASES AND RETROACTIVE TAX CLAIMS; EXPROPRIATION

OF PROPERTY; CANCELLATION OF CONTRACT RIGHTS AND ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS. BOTH

THE LIKELIHOOD OF SUCH OCCURRENCES AND THEIR OVERALL EFFECT UPON THE CORPORATION

VARY GREATLY FROM COUNTRY TO COUNTRY AND ARE NOT PREDICTABLE.

RECENTLY ISSUED STATEMENTS

OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

IN JUNE 2001, THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD ISSUED STATEMENTS OF

FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS NO. 141 (FAS 141), "BUSINESS COMBINATIONS", AND

NO. 142 (FAS 142), "GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS". UNDER FAS 141, THE

POOLING OF INTERESTS METHOD OF ACCOUNTING IS NO LONGER PERMITTED AND THE

PURCHASE METHOD MUST BE USED FOR BUSINESS COMBINATIONS INITIATED AFTER JUNE 30,

2001. UNDER FAS 142, WHICH WILL BE EFFECTIVE FOR THE CORPORATION BEGINNING

JANUARY 1, 2002, GOODWILL AND CERTAIN INTANGIBLES WILL NO LONGER BE AMORTIZED

BUT WILL BE SUBJECT TO ANNUAL IMPAIRMENT TESTS. THE EFFECT OF ADOPTION OF THE

NEW STANDARDS ON THE CORPORATION'S FINANCIAL STATEMENTS WILL BE NEGLIGIBLE.

IN AUGUST 2001, THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD ISSUED STATEMENT

OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS NO. 143 (FAS 143), "ACCOUNTING FOR ASSET

RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS". FAS 143 IS REQUIRED TO BE ADOPTED BY THE CORPORATION NO

LATER THAN JANUARY 1, 2003 AND ITS PRIMARY IMPACT WILL BE TO CHANGE THE METHOD

OF ACCRUING FOR UPSTREAM SITE RESTORATION COSTS. THESE COSTS ARE CURRENTLY

ACCRUED RATABLY OVER THE PRODUCTIVE LIVES OF THE ASSETS. AT THE END OF 2001 THE

CUMULATIVE AMOUNT ACCRUED UNDER THIS POLICY WAS APPROXIMATELY $3.2 BILLION.

UNDER FAS 143, THE FAIR VALUE OF ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS WILL BE RECORDED

AS LIABILITIES WHEN THEY ARE INCURRED, WHICH ARE TYPICALLY AT THE TIME THE

ASSETS ARE INSTALLED. AMOUNTS RECORDED FOR THE RELATED ASSETS WILL BE INCREASED

BY THE AMOUNT OF THESE OBLIGATIONS. OVER TIME THE LIABILITIES WILL BE ACCRUED

FOR THE CHANGE IN THEIR PRESENT VALUE AND THE INITIAL CAPITALIZED COSTS WILL BE

DEPRECIATED OVER THE USEFUL LIVES OF THE RELATED ASSETS. THE CORPORATION IS

EVALUATING THE IMPACT OF ADOPTING FAS 143.

IN AUGUST 2001, THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD ISSUED STATEMENT

OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS NO. 144 (FAS 144), "ACCOUNTING FOR THE

IMPAIRMENT OR DISPOSAL OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS". FAS 144 IS REQUIRED TO BE ADOPTED

PROSPECTIVELY BY THE CORPORATION NO LATER THAN JANUARY 1, 2002. FAS 144

SUPERCEDES PREVIOUS GUIDANCE RELATED TO THE IMPAIRMENT OR DISPOSAL OF LONG-LIVED

ASSETS. FOR LONG-LIVED ASSETS TO BE HELD AND USED, IT RESOLVES CERTAIN

IMPLEMENTATION ISSUES OF THE FORMER STANDARDS, BUT RETAINS THE BASIC

REQUIREMENTS OF RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT OF IMPAIRMENT LOSSES. FOR LONG-LIVED

ASSETS TO BE DISPOSED OF BY SALE, IT BROADENS THE DEFINITION OF THOSE DISPOSALS

THAT SHOULD BE REPORTED SEPARATELY AS DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS. THERE IS NO

IMPACT ON THE CORPORATION OF ADOPTING FAS 144, EXCEPT THAT FUTURE SALES OF

LONG-LIVED ASSETS MAY BE REQUIRED TO BE PRESENTED AS DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS,

WHICH WOULD BE A DIFFERENT PRESENTATION THAN UNDER PREVIOUS ACCOUNTING

STANDARDS.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

THE CORPORATION'S ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL REPORTING FAIRLY REFLECT ITS

STRAIGHTFORWARD BUSINESS MODEL INVOLVING THE EXTRACTING, REFINING AND MARKETING

OF HYDROCARBONS AND HYDROCARBON-BASED PRODUCTS. THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS IN CONFORMITY WITH U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES

(GAAP) REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS THAT AFFECT THE

REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS, LIABILITIES, REVENUES AND EXPENSES AND THE

DISCLOSURE OF CONTINGENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. THE FOLLOWING SUMMARY PROVIDES

FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT THE CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND SHOULD BE READ IN

CONJUNCTION WITH NOTE 1 ON PAGE 38.

30

PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION

THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDE THE ACCOUNTS OF THOSE SIGNIFICANT

SUBSIDIARIES THAT THE CORPORATION CONTROLS. THEY ALSO INCLUDE THE CORPORATION'S

UNDIVIDED INTERESTS IN UPSTREAM ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. AMOUNTS REPRESENTING THE

CORPORATION'S PERCENTAGE INTEREST IN THE UNDERLYING NET ASSETS OF OTHER

SIGNIFICANT AFFILIATES THAT IT DOES NOT CONTROL, BUT EXERCISES SIGNIFICANT

INFLUENCE, ARE INCLUDED IN "INVESTMENTS AND ADVANCES"; THE CORPORATION'S SHARE

OF THE NET INCOME OF THESE COMPANIES IS INCLUDED IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT

OF INCOME CAPTION "EARNINGS FROM EQUITY INTERESTS AND OTHER REVENUE". THE

ACCOUNTING FOR THESE NON-CONSOLIDATED COMPANIES IS REFERRED TO AS THE EQUITY

METHOD OF ACCOUNTING.

ADDITIONAL DISCLOSURES OF SUMMARY BALANCE SHEET AND INCOME INFORMATION FOR

THOSE SUBSIDIARIES ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER THE EQUITY METHOD OF ACCOUNTING CAN BE

FOUND IN NOTE 8 ON PAGE 41. THE CORPORATION BELIEVES THIS TO BE IMPORTANT

INFORMATION NECESSARY TO A FULL UNDERSTANDING OF THE CORPORATION'S FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS.

INVESTMENTS IN COMPANIES THAT ARE PARTIALLY OWNED BY THE CORPORATION ARE

INTEGRAL TO THE CORPORATION'S OPERATION'S. IN SOME CASES THEY SERVE TO BALANCE

WORLDWIDE RISKS AND IN OTHERS THEY PROVIDE THE ONLY AVAILABLE MEANS OF ENTRY

INTO A PARTICULAR MARKET OR AREA OF INTEREST. THE OTHER PARTIES WHO ALSO HAVE AN

EQUITY INTEREST IN THESE COMPANIES ARE EITHER INDEPENDENT THIRD PARTIES OR HOST

GOVERNMENTS THAT SHARE IN THE BUSINESS RESULTS ACCORDING TO THEIR PERCENTAGE

OWNERSHIP. THE CORPORATION DOES NOT INVEST IN THESE COMPANIES IN ORDER TO REMOVE

LIABILITIES FROM ITS BALANCE SHEET. IN FACT, THE CORPORATION HAS LONG BEEN ON

RECORD SUPPORTING AN ALTERNATIVE ACCOUNTING METHOD THAT WOULD REQUIRE EACH

INVESTOR TO CONSOLIDATE ITS PERCENTAGE SHARE OF ALL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES IN

THESE PARTIALLY OWNED COMPANIES RATHER THAN ONLY THE PERCENTAGE IN THE NET

EQUITY. THIS METHOD OF ACCOUNTING FOR INVESTMENTS IN PARTIALLY OWNED COMPANIES

IS NOT PERMITTED BY GAAP EXCEPT WHERE THE INVESTMENTS ARE IN THE UNDIVIDED

INTERESTS IN UPSTREAM ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. HOWEVER, FOR PURPOSES OF

CALCULATING RETURN ON AVERAGE CAPITAL EMPLOYED, WHICH IS NOT COVERED BY GAAP

STANDARDS, THE CORPORATION INCLUDES ITS SHARE OF DEBT OF THESE PARTIALLY OWNED

COMPANIES IN THE DETERMINATION OF AVERAGE CAPITAL EMPLOYED.

REVENUE RECOGNITION

REVENUES ASSOCIATED WITH SALES OF CRUDE OIL, NATURAL GAS, PETROLEUM AND CHEMICAL

PRODUCTS AND ALL OTHER ITEMS ARE RECORDED WHEN TITLE PASSES TO THE CUSTOMER.

THE CORPORATION DOES NOT ENGAGE IN ARRANGEMENTS WHEREBY THE CORPORATION HAS

ONGOING RELATIONSHIPS WITH ITS BUYERS THAT REQUIRE IT TO REPURCHASE ITS PRODUCTS

OR PROVIDE BUYERS WITH THE RIGHT OF RETURN. AS A RESULT, THE RECOGNITION OF

REVENUES IS STRAIGHTFORWARD.

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS

AS DISCUSSED ON PAGE 29, THE CORPORATION MAKES LIMITED USE OF DERIVATIVES.

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS ARE NOT HELD FOR TRADING PURPOSES NOR DO THEY HAVE

LEVERAGE FEATURES. THE CORPORATION'S SIZE, GEOGRAPHIC DIVERSITY AND THE

COMPLEMENTARY NATURE OF THE UPSTREAM, DOWNSTREAM, AND CHEMICALS BUSINESSES

MITIGATE THE CORPORATION'S RISK FROM CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES, CURRENCY RATES,

AND COMMODITY PRICES, REDUCING THE CORPORATION'S NEED FOR DERIVATIVES TO MANAGE

BUSINESS RISK.

BECAUSE OF THEIR LIMITED USE, ACCOUNTING POLICIES FOR DERIVATIVES DO NOT

IMPACT INFORMATION THAT IS SIGNIFICANT OR CRITICAL TO AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE

CORPORATION'S FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

INVENTORIES

CRUDE OIL, PRODUCTS AND MERCHANDISE ARE CARRIED AT THE LOWER OF CURRENT MARKET

VALUE OR COST (GENERALLY DETERMINED UNDER THE LAST-IN, FIRST-OUT METHOD - LIFO).

THERE ARE OTHER ACCEPTABLE METHODS OF ACCOUNTING FOR INVENTORY SUCH AS

FIRST-IN, FIRST-OUT OR AVERAGE COST. THE CORPORATION USES THE LIFO METHOD

BECAUSE IT CHARGES EACH SALE WITH THE COST OF THE MOST RECENTLY PURCHASED

INVENTORY. AS SUCH, THE PROFIT RECOGNIZED ON THESE SALES IS BASED ON THE LATEST

COST STRUCTURE AND GENERALLY RESULTS IN A BETTER MATCHING OF COSTS AND REVENUES.

PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT

THE CORPORATION'S EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION ACTIVITIES ARE ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER

THE "SUCCESSFUL EFFORTS" METHOD. DEPRECIATION, DEPLETION AND AMORTIZATION, BASED

ON COST LESS ESTIMATED SALVAGE VALUE OF THE ASSET, ARE PRIMARILY DETERMINED

UNDER EITHER THE UNIT-OF-PRODUCTION METHOD OR THE STRAIGHT-LINE METHOD.

UNIT-OF-PRODUCTION RATES ARE BASED ON OIL, GAS AND MINERAL RESERVES ESTIMATED TO

BE RECOVERABLE FROM EXISTING FACILITIES. THE STRAIGHT-LINE METHOD IS BASED ON

ESTIMATED ASSET SERVICE LIFE TAKING OBSOLESCENCE INTO CONSIDERATION. THE SERVICE

LIVES OF REFINERY AND CHEMICALS COMPONENTS GENERALLY EXTEND TO 25 AND 20 YEARS,

RESPECTIVELY, AND REFLECT THE CORPORATION'S LONG-TERM COMMITMENT TO EFFECTIVE

ASSET OPTIMIZATION.

UNDER THE "SUCCESSFUL EFFORTS" METHOD, COSTS ARE ACCUMULATED ON A

FIELD-BY-FIELD BASIS WITH CERTAIN EXPLORATORY EXPENDITURES AND EXPLORATORY DRY

HOLES BEING EXPENSED AS INCURRED. EXPLORATORY WELLS THAT FIND OIL AND GAS IN AN

AREA REQUIRING A MAJOR CAPITAL EXPENDITURE BEFORE PRODUCTION CAN BEGIN ARE

EVALUATED ANNUALLY TO ENSURE THAT COMMERCIAL QUANTITIES OF RESERVES HAVE BEEN

FOUND OR THAT ADDITIONAL EXPLORATION WORK IS UNDERWAY OR PLANNED. COSTS OF

PRODUCTIVE WELLS AND DEVELOPMENT DRY HOLES ARE CAPITALIZED AND AMORTIZED ON THE

UNIT-OF-PRODUCTION METHOD FOR EACH FIELD. THE CORPORATION USES THIS ACCOUNTING

POLICY INSTEAD OF THE "FULL COST" METHOD BECAUSE IT PROVIDES A MORE TIMELY

ACCOUNTING OF THE SUCCESS OR FAILURE OF THE CORPORATION'S EXPLORATION AND

PRODUCTION ACTIVITIES. IF THE FULL COST METHOD WERE USED, ALL COSTS WOULD BE

CAPITALIZED AND DEPRECIATED ON A COUNTRY-BY-COUNTRY BASIS. THE CAPITALIZED COSTS

WOULD BE SUBJECT TO AN IMPAIRMENT TEST BY COUNTRY. THE FULL COST METHOD WOULD

TEND TO DELAY THE EXPENSE RECOGNITION OF UNSUCCESSFUL PROJECTS.

OIL, GAS AND OTHER PROPERTIES HELD AND USED BY THE CORPORATION ARE REVIEWED

FOR IMPAIRMENT WHENEVER EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THAT THE

CARRYING AMOUNTS MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE. THE CORPORATION ESTIMATES THE FUTURE

UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS OF THE AFFECTED PROPERTIES TO JUDGE THE RECOVERABILITY

OF CARRYING AMOUNTS. IN GENERAL, ANALYSES ARE BASED ON PROVED RESERVES, EXCEPT

IN CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE IT IS PROBABLE THAT ADDITIONAL RESOURCES WILL BE

DEVELOPED AND CONTRIBUTE TO CASH FLOWS IN THE FUTURE.

EVALUATIONS OF OIL AND GAS RESERVES ARE IMPORTANT TO THE EFFECTIVE

MANAGEMENT OF UPSTREAM ASSETS. THEY ARE INTEGRAL TO MAKING INVESTMENT DECISIONS

ABOUT OIL AND GAS PROPERTIES SUCH AS WHETHER DEVELOP-

31

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS

MENT SHOULD PROCEED OR ENHANCED RECOVERY METHODS SHOULD BE UNDERTAKEN. PROVED

OIL AND GAS RESERVE QUANTITIES ARE ALSO USED AS THE BASIS OF CALCULATING THE

UNIT-OF-PRODUCTION RATES FOR DEPRECIATION AND EVALUATING FOR IMPAIRMENT. THESE

RESERVES ARE THE ESTIMATED QUANTITIES OF CRUDE OIL, NATURAL GAS AND NATURAL GAS

LIQUIDS THAT GEOLOGICAL AND ENGINEERING DATA DEMONSTRATE WITH REASONABLE

CERTAINTY TO BE RECOVERABLE IN FUTURE YEARS FROM KNOWN RESERVOIRS UNDER EXISTING

ECONOMIC AND OPERATING CONDITIONS, I.E., PRICES AND COSTS AS OF THE DATE THE

ESTIMATE IS MADE. THE ESTIMATION OF RESERVES IS AN ONGOING PROCESS BASED ON

RIGOROUS TECHNICAL EVALUATIONS AND EXTRAPOLATIONS OF WELL INFORMATION SUCH AS

FLOW RATES AND RESERVOIR PRESSURE DECLINES.

SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION ON OIL AND GAS EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION

ACTIVITIES CAN BE FOUND ON PAGES 57 TO 61. INCLUDED IN THAT SECTION ON PAGE 60

IS INFORMATION ON CANADIAN TAR SANDS PROVEN RESERVES. THIS INFORMATION IS SHOWN

SEPARATELY FROM THE CONVENTIONAL LIQUIDS AND NATURAL GAS PROVED RESERVES. FOR

INTERNAL MANAGEMENT PURPOSES, THE CORPORATION DOES NOT VIEW THESE RESERVES

SEPARATELY, BUT INSTEAD CONSIDERS THEM AND THEIR DEVELOPMENT AS AN INTEGRAL PART

OF TOTAL UPSTREAM OPERATIONS. REFINING TAR SANDS RESERVES PRODUCES THE SAME

PETROLEUM PRODUCTS THAT ARE PRODUCED FROM REFINING CONVENTIONAL OIL AND GAS

RESERVES. HOWEVER, U.S. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION REGULATIONS DEFINE

THESE TAR SANDS RESERVES AS MINING RESERVES AND NOT A PART OF CONVENTIONAL OIL

AND GAS RESERVES.

SITE RESTORATION AND ENVIRONMENTAL CONSERVATION COSTS

SITE RESTORATION COSTS THAT MAY BE INCURRED BY THE CORPORATION AT THE END OF THE

OPERATING LIFE OF CERTAIN OF ITS FACILITIES AND PROPERTIES ARE ACCRUED RATABLY

OVER THE ASSET'S PRODUCTIVE LIFE. LIABILITIES FOR ENVIRONMENTAL CONSERVATION ARE

RECORDED WHEN IT IS PROBABLE THAT OBLIGATIONS HAVE BEEN INCURRED AND THE AMOUNTS

CAN BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED.

THE NECESSITY OF RECORDING LIABILITIES FOR THESE COSTS IS PRESCRIBED BY

GAAP. ESTIMATING THE PROBABILITY OF WHETHER OBLIGATIONS HAVE BEEN INCURRED AND

THE AMOUNTS THAT SHOULD BE RECORDED REQUIRES SIGNIFICANT MANAGEMENT JUDGMENT.

THIS JUDGMENT IS BASED ON EXTENSIVE COST AND ENGINEERING STUDIES USING THE

LATEST AVAILABLE TECHNOLOGY.

FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION

THE "FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY" FOR TRANSLATING THE ACCOUNTS OF THE MAJORITY OF

DOWNSTREAM AND CHEMICALS OPERATIONS OUTSIDE THE U.S. IS THE LOCAL CURRENCY.

LOCAL CURRENCY IS ALSO USED FOR UPSTREAM OPERATIONS THAT ARE RELATIVELY

SELF-CONTAINED AND INTEGRATED WITHIN A PARTICULAR COUNTRY. THE U.S. DOLLAR IS

USED FOR OPERATIONS IN HIGHLY INFLATIONARY ECONOMIES AND CERTAIN OTHER

COUNTRIES.

THE METHOD OF TRANSLATING THE FOREIGN CURRENCY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF THE

CORPORATIONS INTERNATIONAL SUBSIDIARIES INTO U.S. DOLLARS IS PRESCRIBED BY GAAP.

UNDER THESE PRINCIPLES, IT IS NECESSARY TO SELECT THE FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY OF

THESE SUBSIDIARIES. THE FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY IS THE CURRENCY OF THE PRIMARY

ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH THE SUBSIDIARY OPERATES. MANAGEMENT SELECTS THE

FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY AFTER EVALUATING THIS ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT. DOWNSTREAM AND

CHEMICALS OPERATIONS NORMALLY USE THE LOCAL CURRENCY, EXCEPT IN HIGHLY

INFLATIONARY COUNTRIES, PRIMARILY LATIN AMERICA, AS WELL AS IN SINGAPORE, WHICH

USES THE U.S. DOLLAR, BECAUSE IT PREDOMINANTLY SELLS INTO THE U.S. DOLLAR EXPORT

MARKET. UPSTREAM OPERATIONS ALSO USE THE LOCAL CURRENCY AS THE FUNCTIONAL

CURRENCY, EXCEPT WHERE CRUDE AND NATURAL GAS PRODUCTION IS PREDOMINANTLY SOLD IN

THE EXPORT MARKET IN U.S. DOLLARS. THESE OPERATIONS, WHICH USE THE U.S. DOLLAR

AS THEIR FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY, ARE IN MALAYSIA, INDONESIA, NIGERIA, EQUATORIAL

GUINEA AND THE MIDDLE EAST COUNTRIES.

LITIGATION AND OTHER CONTINGENCIES

CLAIMS FOR SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNTS HAVE BEEN MADE AGAINST EXXONMOBIL AND CERTAIN OF

ITS CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES IN PENDING LAWSUITS AND TAX DISPUTES. THESE ARE

SUMMARIZED ON PAGE 27, WITH A MORE EXTENSIVE DISCUSSION INCLUDED IN NOTE 17 ON

PAGE 51.

THE GENERAL GUIDANCE PROVIDED BY GAAP REQUIRES THAT LIABILITIES FOR

CONTINGENCIES SHOULD BE RECORDED WHEN IT IS PROBABLE THAT A LIABILITY HAS BEEN

INCURRED BEFORE THE DATE OF THE BALANCE SHEET AND THAT THE AMOUNT CAN BE

REASONABLY ESTIMATED. SIGNIFICANT MANAGEMENT JUDGMENT IS REQUIRED TO COMPLY WITH

THIS GUIDANCE, AND IT INCLUDES MANAGEMENT REVIEWS WITH THE CORPORATION'S

ATTORNEYS, TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION ALL OF THE RELEVANT FACTS AND

CIRCUMSTANCES.

CONDITIONS ARE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS. ACTUAL FUTURE RESULTS, INCLUDING

MERGER EXPENSES AND SYNERGIES; FINANCING SOURCES; THE RESOLUTION OF

CONTINGENCIES; THE EFFECT OF CHANGES IN PRICES; INTEREST RATES AND OTHER MARKET

DEPENDING ON A NUMBER OF FACTORS, SUCH AS THE OUTCOME OF COMMERCIAL

NEGOTIATIONS; CHANGES IN THE SUPPLY OF AND DEMAND FOR CRUDE OIL, NATURAL GAS,

AND PETROLEUM AND PETROCHEMICAL PRODUCTS; AND OTHER FACTORS DISCUSSED ABOVE AND

UNDER THE CAPTION "FACTORS AFFECTING FUTURE RESULTS" IN ITEM 1 OF EXXONMOBIL'S

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND THE SUPPORTING AND

SUPPLEMENTAL MATERIAL ARE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE MANAGEMENT OF EXXON MOBIL

CORPORATION.

THE CORPORATION'S PRINCIPAL BUSINESS IS ENERGY, INVOLVING THE WORLDWIDE

EXPLORATION, PRODUCTION, TRANSPORTATION AND SALE OF CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS

(UPSTREAM) AND THE MANUFACTURE, TRANSPORTATION AND SALE OF PETROLEUM PRODUCTS

(DOWNSTREAM). THE CORPORATION IS ALSO A MAJOR WORLDWIDE MANUFACTURER AND

MARKETER OF PETROCHEMICALS AND PARTICIPATES IN COAL AND MINERALS MINING AND

ELECTRIC POWER GENERATION.

THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN CONFORMITY WITH GENERALLY

ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO MAKE ESTIMATES THAT AFFECT

THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS, LIABILITIES, REVENUES AND EXPENSES AND THE

DISCLOSURE OF CONTINGENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. ACTUAL RESULTS COULD DIFFER

FROM THESE ESTIMATES.

1. SUMMARY OF ACCOUNTING POLICIES

PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION. THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDE THE

ACCOUNTS OF THOSE SIGNIFICANT SUBSIDIARIES OWNED DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY WITH

MORE THAN 50 PERCENT OF THE VOTING RIGHTS HELD BY THE CORPORATION, AND FOR WHICH

OTHER SHAREHOLDERS DO NOT POSSESS THE RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN SIGNIFICANT

MANAGEMENT DECISIONS. THEY ALSO INCLUDE THE CORPORATION'S SHARE OF THE UNDIVIDED

INTEREST IN UPSTREAM ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. AMOUNTS REPRESENTING THE

CORPORATION'S PERCENTAGE INTEREST IN THE UNDERLYING NET ASSETS OF OTHER

SIGNIFICANT SUBSIDIARIES AND LESS THAN MAJORITY OWNED COMPANIES IN WHICH A

SIGNIFICANT EQUITY OWNERSHIP INTEREST IS HELD, ARE INCLUDED IN "INVESTMENTS AND

ADVANCES"; THE CORPORATION'S SHARE OF THE NET INCOME OF THESE COMPANIES IS

INCLUDED IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF INCOME CAPTION "EARNINGS FROM EQUITY

INTERESTS AND OTHER REVENUE."

INVESTMENTS IN OTHER COMPANIES, NONE OF WHICH IS SIGNIFICANT, ARE GENERALLY

INCLUDED IN "INVESTMENTS AND ADVANCES" AT COST OR LESS. DIVIDENDS FROM THESE

COMPANIES ARE INCLUDED IN INCOME AS RECEIVED.

REVENUE RECOGNITION. REVENUES ASSOCIATED WITH SALES OF CRUDE OIL, NATURAL GAS,

PETROLEUM AND CHEMICAL PRODUCTS AND ALL OTHER ITEMS ARE RECORDED WHEN TITLE

PASSES TO THE CUSTOMER.

REVENUES FROM THE PRODUCTION OF NATURAL GAS PROPERTIES IN WHICH THE

CORPORATION HAS AN INTEREST WITH THE OTHER PRODUCERS ARE RECOGNIZED ON THE BASIS

OF THE COMPANY'S NET WORKING INTEREST. DIFFERENCES BETWEEN ACTUAL PRODUCTION AND

NET WORKING INTEREST VOLUMES ARE NOT SIGNIFICANT.

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS. THE CORPORATION MAKES LIMITED USE OF DERIVATIVES.

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS ARE NOT HELD FOR TRADING PURPOSES NOR DO THEY HAVE

LEVERAGE FEATURES. WHEN THE CORPORATION DOES ENTER INTO DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS,

IT IS TO OFFSET EXPOSURES ASSOCIATED WITH INTEREST RATES, FOREIGN CURRENCY

EXCHANGE RATES AND HYDROCARBON PRICES. THE GAINS AND LOSSES RESULTING FROM THE

CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE OF THESE INSTRUMENTS ARE RECORDED IN INCOME, EXCEPT WHEN

THE INSTRUMENTS ARE DESIGNATED AS HEDGING THE CURRENCY EXPOSURE OF NET

INVESTMENTS IN FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES, IN WHICH CASE THEY ARE RECORDED IN THE

CUMULATIVE FOREIGN EXCHANGE TRANSLATION ACCOUNT, AS PART OF SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY.

THE GAINS AND LOSSES ON DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS THAT ARE DESIGNATED AS FAIR

VALUE HEDGES (I.E., THOSE HEDGING THE EXPOSURE TO CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF

AN ASSET OR A LIABILITY OR THE CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF A FIRM COMMITMENT),

ARE OFFSET BY THE GAINS AND LOSSES FROM THE CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE OF THE HEDGED

ITEMS, WHICH ARE ALSO RECOGNIZED IN INCOME. MOST OF THESE DESIGNATED HEDGES ARE

ENTERED INTO AT THE SAME TIME THAT THE HEDGED ITEMS ARE TRANSACTED, THEY ARE

FULLY EFFECTIVE AND IN COMBINATION WITH THE OFFSETTING HEDGED ITEMS, THEY RESULT

IN NO NET IMPACT ON INCOME. IN SOME SITUATIONS, THE CORPORATION HAS CHOSEN NOT

TO DESIGNATE CERTAIN IMMATERIAL DERIVATIVES USED FOR HEDGING ECONOMIC EXPOSURE

AS HEDGES FOR ACCOUNTING PURPOSES DUE TO THE EXCESSIVE ADMINISTRATIVE EFFORT

THAT WOULD BE REQUIRED TO ACCOUNT FOR THESE ITEMS AS HEDGING TRANSACTIONS. THESE

DERIVATIVES ARE RECORDED ON THE BALANCE SHEET AT FAIR VALUE AND THE GAINS AND

LOSSES ARISING FROM CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE ARE RECOGNIZED IN INCOME. ALL

DERIVATIVES ACTIVITY IS IMMATERIAL.

INVENTORIES. CRUDE OIL, PRODUCTS AND MERCHANDISE INVENTORIES ARE CARRIED AT THE

LOWER OF CURRENT MARKET VALUE OR COST (GENERALLY DETERMINED UNDER THE LAST-IN,

FIRST-OUT METHOD - LIFO). COSTS INCLUDE APPLICABLE PURCHASE COSTS AND OPERATING

EXPENSES BUT NOT GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES OR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

COSTS. INVENTORIES OF MATERIALS AND SUPPLIES ARE VALUED AT COST OR LESS.

PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT. DEPRECIATION, DEPLETION AND AMORTIZATION, BASED

ON COST LESS ESTIMATED SALVAGE VALUE OF THE ASSET, ARE PRIMARILY DETERMINED

UNDER EITHER THE UNIT-OF-PRODUCTION METHOD OR THE STRAIGHT-LINE METHOD.

UNIT-OF-PRODUCTION RATES ARE BASED ON OIL, GAS AND OTHER MINERAL RESERVES

ESTIMATED TO BE RECOVERABLE FROM EXISTING FACILITIES. THE STRAIGHT-LINE METHOD

OF DEPRECIATION IS BASED ON ESTIMATED ASSET SERVICE LIFE TAKING OBSOLESCENCE

INTO CONSIDERATION.

MAINTENANCE AND REPAIRS ARE EXPENSED AS INCURRED. MAJOR RENEWALS AND

IMPROVEMENTS ARE CAPITALIZED AND THE ASSETS REPLACED ARE RETIRED.

THE CORPORATION'S UPSTREAM ACTIVITIES ARE ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER THE

"SUCCESSFUL EFFORTS" METHOD. UNDER THIS METHOD, COSTS OF PRODUCTIVE WELLS AND

DEVELOPMENT DRY HOLES, BOTH TANGIBLE AND INTANGIBLE, AS WELL AS PRODUCTIVE

ACREAGE ARE CAPITALIZED AND AMORTIZED ON THE UNIT-OF-PRODUCTION METHOD. COSTS OF

THAT PORTION OF UNDEVELOPED ACREAGE LIKELY TO BE UNPRODUCTIVE, BASED LARGELY ON

HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE, ARE AMORTIZED OVER THE PERIOD OF EXPLORATION. OTHER

EXPLORATORY EXPENDITURES, INCLUDING GEOPHYSICAL COSTS, OTHER DRY HOLE COSTS AND

ANNUAL LEASE RENTALS, ARE EXPENSED AS INCURRED. EXPLORATORY WELLS THAT FIND OIL

AND GAS IN AN AREA REQUIRING A MAJOR CAPITAL EXPENDITURE BEFORE PRODUCTION CAN

BEGIN ARE EVALUATED ANNUALLY TO ASSURE THAT COMMERCIAL QUANTITIES OF RESERVES

HAVE BEEN FOUND OR THAT ADDITIONAL EXPLORATION WORK IS UNDERWAY OR PLANNED.

EXPLORATORY WELL COSTS NOT MEETING EITHER OF THESE TESTS ARE CHARGED TO EXPENSE.

OIL, GAS AND OTHER PROPERTIES HELD AND USED BY THE CORPORATION ARE REVIEWED

FOR IMPAIRMENT WHENEVER EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THAT THE

CARRYING AMOUNTS MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE. THE CORPORATION ESTIMATES THE FUTURE

UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS OF THE AFFECTED PROPERTIES TO JUDGE THE RECOVERABILITY

OF CARRYING AMOUNTS. IN GENERAL, ANALYSES ARE BASED ON PROVED RESERVES, EXCEPT

IN CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE IT IS PROBABLE THAT ADDITIONAL RESOURCES WILL BE

DEVELOPED AND CONTRIBUTE TO CASH FLOWS IN THE FUTURE.

SITE RESTORATION AND ENVIRONMENTAL CONSERVATION COSTS. SITE RESTORATION COSTS

THAT MAY BE INCURRED BY THE CORPORATION AT THE END OF THE OPERATING LIFE OF

CERTAIN OF ITS FACILITIES AND PROPERTIES ARE RESERVED RATABLY OVER THE ASSET'S

PRODUCTIVE LIFE.

38

LIABILITIES FOR ENVIRONMENTAL CONSERVATION ARE RECORDED WHEN IT IS PROBABLE

THAT OBLIGATIONS HAVE BEEN INCURRED AND THE AMOUNTS CAN BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED.

THESE LIABILITIES ARE NOT REDUCED BY POSSIBLE RECOVERIES FROM THIRD PARTIES, AND

PROJECTED CASH EXPENDITURES ARE NOT DISCOUNTED.

FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION. THE "FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY" FOR TRANSLATING THE

ACCOUNTS OF THE MAJORITY OF DOWNSTREAM AND CHEMICAL OPERATIONS OUTSIDE THE U.S.

IS THE LOCAL CURRENCY. LOCAL CURRENCY IS ALSO USED FOR UPSTREAM OPERATIONS THAT

ARE RELATIVELY SELF-CONTAINED AND INTEGRATED WITHIN A PARTICULAR COUNTRY, SUCH

AS IN CANADA, THE UNITED KINGDOM, NORWAY AND CONTINENTAL EUROPE. THE U.S. DOLLAR

IS USED FOR OPERATIONS IN HIGHLY INFLATIONARY ECONOMIES, IN SINGAPORE WHICH IS

PREDOMINANTLY EXPORT ORIENTED AND FOR SOME UPSTREAM OPERATIONS, PRIMARILY IN

MALAYSIA, INDONESIA, NIGERIA, EQUATORIAL GUINEA AND THE MIDDLE EAST COUNTRIES.

FOR ALL OPERATIONS, GAINS OR LOSSES ON REMEASURING FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSACTIONS

INTO FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY ARE INCLUDED IN INCOME.

2. EXTRAORDINARY ITEM AND ACCOUNTING CHANGE

NET INCOME FOR 2001 INCLUDED NET AFTER-TAX GAINS FROM ASSET MANAGEMENT

ACTIVITIES IN THE CHEMICALS SEGMENT AND REGULATORY REQUIRED ASSET DIVESTITURES

IN THE AMOUNT OF $215 MILLION (INCLUDING AN INCOME TAX CREDIT OF $21 MILLION),

OR $0.03 PER COMMON SHARE. NET INCOME FOR 2000 INCLUDED NET AFTER-TAX GAINS FROM

REGULATORY REQUIRED ASSET DIVESTITURES IN THE AMOUNT OF $1,730 MILLION (NET $308

MILLION OF INCOME TAXES), OR $0.25 PER COMMON SHARE. THESE NET AFTER-TAX GAINS

WERE REPORTED AS EXTRAORDINARY ITEMS ACCORDING TO ACCOUNTING REQUIREMENTS FOR

BUSINESS COMBINATIONS ACCOUNTED FOR AS POOLING OF INTERESTS.

AS OF JANUARY 1, 2001, EXXONMOBIL ADOPTED FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

BOARD STATEMENT NO. 133 (FAS 133), "ACCOUNTING FOR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND

HEDGING ACTIVITIES" AS AMENDED BY STATEMENTS NO. 137 AND 138. THIS STATEMENT

REQUIRES THAT ALL DERIVATIVES BE RECOGNIZED AS EITHER ASSETS OR LIABILITIES IN

THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND BE MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE. SINCE THE CORPORATION

MAKES LIMITED USE OF DERIVATIVES, THE EFFECT OF ADOPTION OF FAS 133 ON THE

CORPORATION'S OPERATIONS OR FINANCIAL CONDITION WAS NEGLIGIBLE.

3. MERGER OF EXXON CORPORATION AND MOBIL CORPORATION

ON NOVEMBER 30, 1999, A WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARY OF EXXON CORPORATION (EXXON)

MERGED WITH MOBIL CORPORATION (MOBIL) SO THAT MOBIL BECAME A WHOLLY-OWNED

SUBSIDIARY OF EXXON (THE "MERGER"). AT THE SAME TIME, EXXON CHANGED ITS NAME TO

EXXON MOBIL CORPORATION (EXXONMOBIL). UNDER THE TERMS OF THE AGREEMENT,

APPROXIMATELY 1.0 BILLION SHARES OF EXXONMOBIL COMMON STOCK WERE ISSUED IN

EXCHANGE FOR ALL THE OUTSTANDING SHARES OF MOBIL COMMON STOCK BASED UPON AN

EXCHANGE RATIO OF 1.32015. FOLLOWING THE EXCHANGE, FORMER SHAREHOLDERS OF EXXON

OWNED APPROXIMATELY 70 PERCENT OF THE CORPORATION, WHILE FORMER MOBIL

SHAREHOLDERS OWNED APPROXIMATELY 30 PERCENT OF THE CORPORATION. EACH OUTSTANDING

SHARE OF MOBIL PREFERRED STOCK WAS CONVERTED INTO ONE SHARE OF A NEW CLASS OF

EXXONMOBIL PREFERRED STOCK.

AS A RESULT OF THE MERGER, THE ACCOUNTS OF CERTAIN DOWNSTREAM AND CHEMICALS

OPERATIONS JOINTLY CONTROLLED BY THE COMBINING COMPANIES HAVE BEEN INCLUDED IN

THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. THESE OPERATIONS WERE PREVIOUSLY

ACCOUNTED FOR BY EXXON AND MOBIL AS SEPARATE COMPANIES USING THE EQUITY METHOD

OF ACCOUNTING.

THE MERGER WAS ACCOUNTED FOR AS A POOLING OF INTERESTS. ACCORDINGLY, THE

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GIVE RETROACTIVE EFFECT TO THE MERGER, WITH

ALL PERIODS PRESENTED AS IF EXXON AND MOBIL HAD ALWAYS BEEN COMBINED. CERTAIN

RECLASSIFICATIONS HAVE BEEN MADE TO CONFORM THE PRESENTATION OF EXXON AND MOBIL.

AS A CONDITION OF THE APPROVAL OF THE MERGER, THE U.S. FEDERAL TRADE

COMMISSION AND THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION REQUIRED THAT CERTAIN PROPERTY --

PRIMARILY DOWNSTREAM, PIPELINE AND NATURAL GAS DISTRIBUTION ASSETS -- BE

DIVESTED. THE CARRYING VALUE OF THESE ASSETS WAS APPROXIMATELY $3 BILLION AND

NET AFTER-TAX GAINS OF $40 MILLION AND $1,730 MILLION WERE REPORTED AS

EXTRAORDINARY ITEMS IN 2001 AND 2000, RESPECTIVELY. THE DIVESTED PROPERTIES

HISTORICALLY EARNED APPROXIMATELY $200 MILLION PER YEAR.

4. MERGER EXPENSES AND REORGANIZATION RESERVES

IN ASSOCIATION WITH THE MERGER, $748 MILLION PRE-TAX ($525 MILLION

AFTER-TAX), $1,406 MILLION PRE-TAX ($920 MILLION AFTER-TAX), AND $625 MILLION

PRE-TAX ($469 MILLION AFTER-TAX) OF COSTS WERE RECORDED AS MERGER-RELATED

12. EMPLOYEE STOCK OWNERSHIP PLANS

IN 1989, THE EXXON LEVERAGED EMPLOYEE STOCK OWNERSHIP PLAN (EXXON LESOP) TRUST

BORROWED $1,000 MILLION UNDER THE TERMS OF NOTES GUARANTEED BY EXXON. THE EXXON

LESOP TRUST USED THE PROCEEDS OF THE BORROWING TO PURCHASE SHARES OF EXXON'S

CONVERTIBLE CLASS A PREFERRED STOCK. THE FINAL EXXON LESOP NOTE WAS REPAID IN

1999. BY YEAR-END 1999, ALL REMAINING SHARES OF EXXON CLASS A PREFERRED STOCK

WERE CONVERTED TO EXXONMOBIL COMMON SHARES.

IN 1989, THE MOBIL OIL CORPORATION EMPLOYEE STOCK OWNERSHIP PLAN (MOBIL

LESOP) TRUST BORROWED $800 MILLION UNDER THE TERMS OF NOTES AND DEBENTURES

GUARANTEED BY MOBIL. THE TRUST USED THE PROCEEDS OF THE BORROWING TO PURCHASE

SHARES OF MOBIL'S SERIES B CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK WHICH UPON THE MERGER

WERE CONVERTED INTO SHARES OF EXXONMOBIL CLASS B PREFERRED STOCK WITH SIMILAR

TERMS. BY YEAR-END 1999, ALL REMAINING SHARES OF CLASS B PREFERRED STOCK WERE

CONVERTED TO EXXONMOBIL COMMON SHARES.

THE EXXON LESOP AND MOBIL LESOP WERE MERGED IN LATE 1999 TO CREATE THE

EXXONMOBIL LESOP. THE EXXONMOBIL LESOP IS A CONSTITUENT PART OF THE EXXONMOBIL

SAVINGS PLAN WHICH, EFFECTIVE FEBRUARY 8, 2002, IS AN EMPLOYEE STOCK OWNERSHIP

PLAN IN ITS ENTIRETY. EMPLOYEES ELIGIBLE TO PARTICIPATE IN THE EXXONMOBIL

SAVINGS PLAN MAY ELECT TO PARTICIPATE IN THE EXXONMOBIL LESOP. CORPORATE

CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE PLAN AND DIVIDENDS ARE USED TO MAKE PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST

PAYMENTS ON THE EXXONMOBIL LESOP TRUST NOTES. AS CORPORATE CONTRIBUTIONS AND

DIVIDENDS ARE CREDITED, COMMON SHARES ARE ALLOCATED TO PARTICIPANTS' PLAN

ACCOUNTS. THE CORPORATION'S CONTRIBUTION TO THE EXXONMOBIL LESOP, REPRESENTING

THE AMOUNT BY WHICH DEBT SERVICE EXCEEDED DIVIDENDS ON SHARES HELD BY THE

EXXONMOBIL LESOP, WAS $58 MILLION, $15 MILLION, AND $19 MILLION IN 2001, 2000

AND 1999, RESPECTIVELY.

ACCOUNTING FOR THE PLANS HAS FOLLOWED THE PRINCIPLES THAT WERE IN EFFECT

FOR THE RESPECTIVE PLANS WHEN THEY WERE ESTABLISHED. THE AMOUNT OF COMPENSATION

EXPENSE RELATED TO THE PLANS AND RECORDED BY THE CORPORATION DURING THE PERIODS

WAS $83 MILLION IN 2001, $13 MILLION IN 2000, AND $5 MILLION IN 1999. THE

EXXONMOBIL LESOP TRUST HELD 104.2 MILLION SHARES OF EXXONMOBIL COMMON STOCK AT

THE END OF 2001 AND 109.2 MILLION SHARES AT THE END OF 2000.

SHARES. UNDER THE TERMS OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT, APPROXIMATELY 1.0 BILLION

SHARES OF EXXONMOBIL COMMON STOCK WERE ISSUED IN EXCHANGE FOR ALL OF THE

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

14. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND DERIVATIVES

THE FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS IS DETERMINED BY REFERENCE TO VARIOUS

MARKET DATA AND OTHER VALUATION TECHNIQUES AS APPROPRIATE. LONG-TERM DEBT IS THE

ONLY CATEGORY OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WHOSE FAIR VALUE DIFFERS MATERIALLY FROM

THE RECORDED BOOK VALUE. THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF TOTAL LONG-TERM DEBT,

INCLUDING CAPITALIZED LEASE OBLIGATIONS, AT DECEMBER 31, 2001 AND 2000, WAS $7.9

BILLION AND $8.0 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY, AS COMPARED TO RECORDED BOOK VALUES OF

$7.1 BILLION AND $7.3 BILLION.

THE CORPORATION'S SIZE, GEOGRAPHIC DIVERSITY AND THE COMPLEMENTARY NATURE

OF THE UPSTREAM, DOWNSTREAM AND CHEMICALS BUSINESSES MITIGATE THE CORPORATION'S

RISK FROM CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES, CURRENCY RATES AND COMMODITY PRICES. THE

CORPORATION RELIES ON THESE OPERATING ATTRIBUTES AND STRENGTHS TO REDUCE

ENTERPRISE-WIDE RISK. AS A RESULT, THE CORPORATION MAKES LIMITED USE OF

DERIVATIVES TO OFFSET EXPOSURES ARISING FROM EXISTING TRANSACTIONS.

THE CORPORATION DOES NOT TRADE IN DERIVATIVES NOR DOES IT USE DERIVATIVES

WITH LEVERAGED FEATURES. THE CORPORATION MAINTAINS A SYSTEM OF CONTROLS THAT

INCLUDES A POLICY COVERING THE AUTHORIZATION, REPORTING AND MONITORING OF

DERIVATIVE ACTIVITY. THE CORPORATION'S DERIVATIVE ACTIVITIES POSE NO MATERIAL

CREDIT OR MARKET RISKS TO EXXONMOBIL'S OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL CONDITION OR

LIQUIDITY. INTEREST RATE, FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATE AND COMMODITY PRICE EXPOSURES

ARISING FROM DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS UNDERTAKEN IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE

CORPORATION'S POLICIES HAVE NOT BEEN SIGNIFICANT.

THE FAIR VALUE OF DERIVATIVES OUTSTANDING AND RECORDED ON THE BALANCE SHEET

AT DECEMBER 31, 2001 WAS $50 MILLION BEFORE-TAX. THIS IS THE AMOUNT THAT THE

CORPORATION WOULD HAVE HAD TO PAY TO THIRD PARTIES IF THESE DERIVATIVES HAD BEEN

SETTLED AT YEAR-END. THESE DERIVATIVE FAIR VALUES WERE SUBSTANTIALLY OFFSET BY

THE FAIR VALUES OF THE UNDERLYING EXPOSURES BEING HEDGED. DURING 2001, THE

CORPORATION RECOGNIZED A BEFORE-TAX GAIN OF $23 MILLION RELATED TO DERIVATIVE

ACTIVITY. THIS GAIN INCLUDED THE OFFSETTING AMOUNTS FROM THE CHANGES IN FAIR

VALUE OF THE ITEMS BEING HEDGED BY THE DERIVATIVES.

15. LONG-TERM DEBT

AT DECEMBER 31, 2001, LONG-TERM DEBT CONSISTED OF $6,465 MILLION DUE IN U.S.

DOLLARS AND $634 MILLION REPRESENTING THE U.S. DOLLAR EQUIVALENT AT YEAR-END

EXCHANGE RATES OF AMOUNTS PAYABLE IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES. THESE AMOUNTS EXCLUDE

THAT PORTION OF LONG-TERM DEBT, TOTALING $339 MILLION, WHICH MATURES WITHIN ONE

YEAR AND IS INCLUDED IN CURRENT LIABILITIES. THE AMOUNTS OF LONG-TERM DEBT

MATURING, TOGETHER WITH SINKING FUND PAYMENTS REQUIRED, IN EACH OF THE FOUR

YEARS AFTER DECEMBER 31, 2002, IN MILLIONS OF DOLLARS, ARE: 2003 - $880, 2004 -

$2,176, 2005 - $328 AND 2006 - $114. CERTAIN OF THE BORROWINGS DESCRIBED MAY

FROM TIME TO TIME BE ASSIGNED TO OTHER EXXONMOBIL AFFILIATES. AT DECEMBER 31,

2001, THE CORPORATION'S UNUSED LONG-TERM CREDIT LINES WERE NOT MATERIAL.

THE TOTAL OUTSTANDING BALANCE OF DEFEASED DEBT AT YEAR-END 2001 WAS $408

MILLION. SUMMARIZED LONG-TERM BORROWINGS AT YEAR-END 2001 AND 2000 WERE AS SHOWN

IN THE ADJACENT TABLE.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

16. INCENTIVE PROGRAM

THE 1993 INCENTIVE PROGRAM PROVIDES FOR GRANTS OF STOCK OPTIONS, STOCK

APPRECIATION RIGHTS (SARS), RESTRICTED STOCK AND OTHER FORMS OF AWARD. AWARDS

MAY BE GRANTED OVER A 10-YEAR PERIOD TO ELIGIBLE EMPLOYEES OF THE CORPORATION

AND THOSE AFFILIATES AT LEAST 50 PERCENT OWNED. THE NUMBER OF SHARES OF STOCK

WHICH MAY BE AWARDED EACH YEAR UNDER THE 1993 INCENTIVE PROGRAM MAY NOT EXCEED

SEVEN TENTHS OF ONE PERCENT (0.7%) OF THE TOTAL NUMBER OF SHARES OF COMMON STOCK

OF THE CORPORATION OUTSTANDING (EXCLUDING SHARES HELD BY THE CORPORATION) ON

DECEMBER 31 OF THE PRECEDING YEAR. IF THE TOTAL NUMBER OF SHARES EFFECTIVELY

GRANTED IN ANY YEAR IS LESS THAN THE MAXIMUM NUMBER OF SHARES ALLOWABLE, THE

BALANCE MAY BE CARRIED OVER THEREAFTER. OUTSTANDING AWARDS ARE SUBJECT TO

CERTAIN FORFEITURE PROVISIONS CONTAINED IN THE PROGRAM OR AWARD INSTRUMENT.

OPTIONS AND SARS MAY BE GRANTED AT PRICES NOT LESS THAN 100 PERCENT OF

MARKET VALUE ON THE DATE OF GRANT AND HAVE A MAXIMUM LIFE OF 10 YEARS. MOST OF

THE OPTIONS AND SARS NORMALLY FIRST BECOME EXERCISABLE ONE YEAR FOLLOWING THE

DATE OF GRANT.

ON THE CLOSING OF THE MERGER ON NOVEMBER 30, 1999, OUTSTANDING OPTIONS AND

SARS GRANTED BY MOBIL UNDER ITS 1995 INCENTIVE COMPENSATION AND STOCK OWNERSHIP

PLAN AND PRIOR PLANS WERE ASSUMED BY EXXONMOBIL AND CONVERTED INTO RIGHTS TO

ACQUIRE EXXONMOBIL COMMON STOCK WITH ADJUSTMENTS TO REFLECT THE EXCHANGE RATIO.

NO FURTHER AWARDS MAY BE GRANTED UNDER THE FORMER MOBIL PLANS.

SHARES AVAILABLE FOR GRANTING UNDER THE 1993 INCENTIVE PROGRAM WERE 133,115

THOUSAND AT THE BEGINNING OF 2001 AND 98,668 THOUSAND AT THE END OF 2001. AT

DECEMBER 31, 2000 AND 2001, RESPECTIVELY, 2,438 THOUSAND AND 2,559 THOUSAND

SHARES OF RESTRICTED COMMON STOCK WERE OUTSTANDING.

STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS NO. 123, "ACCOUNTING FOR

STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION," WAS IMPLEMENTED IN JANUARY 1996. AS PERMITTED BY THE

STANDARD, EXXONMOBIL RETAINED ITS PRIOR METHOD OF ACCOUNTING FOR STOCK

COMPENSATION. IF THE PROVISIONS OF STATEMENT NO. 123 HAD BEEN ADOPTED, NET

INCOME AND EARNINGS PER SHARE (ON BOTH A BASIC AND DILUTED BASIS) WOULD HAVE

BEEN REDUCED BY $285 MILLION, OR $0.04 PER SHARE IN 2001; $296 MILLION, OR $0.04

PER SHARE IN 2000 AND $149 MILLION, OR $0.02 PER SHARE IN 1999. FOR THE

EXXONMOBIL PLAN, THE AVERAGE FAIR VALUE OF EACH OPTION GRANTED DURING 2001, 2000

AND 1999 WAS $6.89, $10.18 AND $9.85, RESPECTIVELY. THE FAIR VALUE WAS ESTIMATED

AT THE GRANT DATE USING AN OPTION-PRICING MODEL WITH THE FOLLOWING WEIGHTED

AVERAGE ASSUMPTIONS FOR 2001, 2000 AND 1999, RESPECTIVELY: RISK-FREE INTEREST

RATES OF 4.6 PERCENT, 5.5 PERCENT AND 6.2 PERCENT; EXPECTED LIFE OF 6 YEARS FOR

ALL YEARS; VOLATILITY OF 16 PERCENT, 16 PERCENT AND 15 PERCENT AND A DIVIDEND

YIELD OF 2.5 PERCENT, 2.0 PERCENT AND 2.1 PERCENT. FOR THE MOBIL PLANS, THE

AVERAGE FAIR VALUE OF EACH MOBIL OPTION GRANTED DURING 1999 WAS $8.51. THE FAIR

VALUE WAS ESTIMATED AT THE GRANT DATE USING AN OPTION-PRICING MODEL WITH THE

FOLLOWING WEIGHTED AVERAGE ASSUMPTIONS FOR 1999: RISK-FREE INTEREST RATE OF 5.2

PERCENT; EXPECTED LIFE OF 5 YEARS; VOLATILITY OF 20 PERCENT AND A DIVIDEND YIELD

OF 2.7 PERCENT.

17. LITIGATION AND OTHER CONTINGENCIES

A NUMBER OF LAWSUITS, INCLUDING CLASS ACTIONS, WERE BROUGHT IN VARIOUS COURTS

AGAINST EXXON MOBIL CORPORATION AND CERTAIN OF ITS SUBSIDIARIES RELATING TO THE

ACCIDENTAL RELEASE OF CRUDE OIL FROM THE TANKER EXXON VALDEZ IN 1989. THE VAST

MAJORITY OF THE CLAIMS HAVE BEEN RESOLVED LEAVING A FEW COMPENSATORY DAMAGES

CASES TO BE TRIED. ALL OF THE PUNITIVE DAMAGE CLAIMS WERE CONSOLIDATED IN THE

CIVIL TRIAL THAT BEGAN IN MAY 1994.

IN THAT TRIAL, ON SEPTEMBER 24, 1996, THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR

THE DISTRICT OF ALASKA ENTERED A JUDGMENT IN THE AMOUNT OF $5.058 BILLION. THE

DISTRICT COURT AWARDED APPROXIMATELY $19.6 MILLION IN COMPENSATORY DAMAGES TO

FISHER PLAINTIFFS, $38 MILLION IN PREJUDGMENT INTEREST ON THE COMPENSATORY

DAMAGES AND $5 BILLION IN PUNITIVE DAMAGES TO A CLASS COMPOSED OF ALL PERSONS

AND ENTITIES WHO ASSERTED CLAIMS FOR PUNITIVE DAMAGES FROM THE CORPORATION AS A

RESULT OF THE EXXON VALDEZ GROUNDING. THE DISTRICT COURT ALSO ORDERED THAT THESE

AWARDS SHALL BEAR INTEREST FROM AND AFTER ENTRY OF THE JUDGMENT. THE DISTRICT

COURT STAYED EXECUTION ON THE JUDGMENT PENDING APPEAL BASED ON A $6.75 BILLION

LETTER OF CREDIT POSTED BY THE CORPORATION. EXXONMOBIL APPEALED THE JUDGMENT. ON

NOVEMBER 7, 2001, THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT

VACATED THE PUNITIVE DAMAGE AWARD AS BEING EXCESSIVE UNDER THE CONSTITUTION AND

REMANDED THE CASE TO THE DISTRICT COURT FOR IT TO DETERMINE THE AMOUNT OF THE

PUNITIVE DAMAGE AWARD CONSISTENT WITH THE NINTH CIRCUIT'S HOLDING. THE NINTH

CIRCUIT UPHELD THE COMPENSATORY DAMAGE AWARD WHICH HAS BEEN PAID. THE LETTER OF

CREDIT WAS TERMINATED ON FEBRUARY 1, 2002.

ON JANUARY 29, 1997, A SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT WAS CONCLUDED RESOLVING ALL

REMAINING MATTERS BETWEEN THE CORPORATION AND VARIOUS INSURERS ARISING FROM THE

VALDEZ ACCIDENT. UNDER TERMS OF THIS SETTLEMENT, EXXONMOBIL RECEIVED $480

MILLION. FINAL INCOME STATEMENT RECOGNITION OF THIS SETTLEMENT CONTINUES TO BE

DEFERRED IN VIEW OF UNCERTAINTY REGARDING THE ULTIMATE COST TO THE CORPORATION

OF THE VALDEZ ACCIDENT.

THE ULTIMATE COST TO EXXONMOBIL FROM THE LAWSUITS ARISING FROM THE EXXON

VALDEZ GROUNDING IS NOT POSSIBLE TO PREDICT AND MAY NOT BE RESOLVED FOR A NUMBER

OF YEARS.

UNDER THE OCTOBER 8, 1991, CIVIL AGREEMENT AND CONSENT DECREES WITH THE

U.S. AND ALASKA GOVERNMENTS, THE CORPORATION MADE THE FINAL PAYMENT OF $70

MILLION IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2001. THIS PAYMENT, ALONG WITH PRIOR PAYMENTS,

WAS CHARGED AGAINST THE PROVISION THAT WAS PREVIOUSLY ESTABLISHED TO COVER THE

COSTS OF THE SETTLEMENT.

A DISPUTE WITH A DUTCH AFFILIATE CONCERNING AN OVERLIFT OF NATURAL GAS BY A

GERMAN AFFILIATE WAS RESOLVED BY PAYMENTS BY THE GERMAN AFFILIATE PURSUANT TO AN

ARBITRATION AWARD. THE GERMAN AFFILIATE HAD PAID ROYALTIES ON THE EXCESS GAS AND

RECOVERED THE ROYALTIES IN 2001. THE ONLY SUBSTANTIVE ISSUE REMAINING IS THE

TAXES PAYABLE ON THE FINAL COMPENSATION FOR THE OVERLIFT. RESOLUTION OF THIS

ISSUE WILL NOT HAVE A MATERIALLY ADVERSE EFFECT UPON THE CORPORATION'S

OPERATIONS OR FINANCIAL CONDITION.

ON DECEMBER 19, 2000, A JURY IN MONTGOMERY COUNTY, ALABAMA, RETURNED A

VERDICT AGAINST THE CORPORATION IN A CONTRACT DISPUTE OVER ROYALTIES IN THE

AMOUNT OF $87.69 MILLION IN COMPENSATORY DAMAGES AND $3.42 BILLION IN PUNITIVE

DAMAGES IN THE CASE OF EXXON CORPORATION V. STATE OF ALABAMA, ET AL. THE VERDICT

WAS UPHELD BY THE TRIAL COURT ON MAY 4, 2001. EXXONMOBIL HAS APPEALED THE

JUDGMENT AND BELIEVES THAT IT SHOULD BE SET ASIDE OR SUBSTANTIALLY REDUCED ON

FACTUAL AND CONSTITUTIONAL GROUNDS. THE ULTIMATE OUTCOME IS NOT EXPECTED TO HAVE

A MATERIALLY ADVERSE EFFECT UPON THE CORPORATION'S OPERATIONS OR FINANCIAL

CONDITION.

ON MAY 22, 2001, A STATE COURT JURY IN NEW ORLEANS, LOUISIANA, RETURNED A

VERDICT AGAINST THE CORPORATION AND THREE OTHER ENTITIES IN A CASE BROUGHT BY A

LANDOWNER CLAIMING DAMAGE TO HIS PROPERTY. THE PROPERTY HAD BEEN LEASED BY THE

LANDOWNER TO A COMPANY THAT PERFORMED PIPE CLEANING AND STORAGE SERVICES FOR

CUSTOMERS, INCLUDING THE CORPORATION. THE JURY AWARDED THE PLAINTIFF $56 MILLION

IN COMPENSATORY DAMAGES (90 PERCENT TO BE PAID BY THE CORPORATION) AND $1

BILLION IN PUNITIVE DAMAGES (ALL TO BE PAID BY THE CORPORATION). THE DAMAGE

RELATED TO THE PRESENCE OF NATURALLY OCCURRING RADIOACTIVE MATERIAL (NORM) ON

THE SITE RESULTING FROM PIPE CLEANING OPERATIONS. THE AWARD HAS BEEN UPHELD AT

THE TRIAL COURT. EXXONMOBIL WILL APPEAL THE JUDGMENT TO THE LOUISIANA FOURTH

CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS AND BELIEVES THAT THE JUDGMENT SHOULD BE SET ASIDE OR

SUBSTANTIALLY REDUCED ON FACTUAL AND CONSTITUTIONAL GROUNDS. THE ULTIMATE

OUTCOME IS NOT EXPECTED TO HAVE A MATERIALLY ADVERSE EFFECT UPON THE

CORPORATION'S OPERATIONS OR FINANCIAL CONDITION.

THE U.S. TAX COURT HAS DECIDED THE ISSUE WITH RESPECT TO THE PRICING OF

CRUDE OIL PURCHASED FROM SAUDI ARABIA FOR THE YEARS 1979-1981 IN FAVOR OF THE

CORPORATION. THIS DECISION IS SUBJECT TO APPEAL. CERTAIN OTHER ISSUES FOR THE

YEARS 1979-1993 REMAIN PENDING BEFORE THE TAX COURT. THE ULTIMATE RESOLUTION OF

THESE ISSUES IS NOT EXPECTED TO HAVE A MATERIALLY ADVERSE EFFECT UPON THE

CORPORATION'S OPERATIONS OR FINANCIAL CONDITION.

CLAIMS FOR SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNTS HAVE BEEN MADE AGAINST EXXONMOBIL AND

CERTAIN OF ITS CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES IN OTHER PENDING LAWSUITS, THE OUTCOME

OF WHICH IS NOT EXPECTED TO HAVE A MATERIALLY ADVERSE EFFECT UPON THE

CORPORATION'S OPERATIONS OR FINANCIAL CONDITION.

THE CORPORATION AND CERTAIN OF ITS CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES WERE

CONTINGENTLY LIABLE AT DECEMBER 31, 2001, FOR $3,921 MILLION, PRIMARILY RELATING

TO GUARANTEES FOR NOTES, LOANS AND PERFORMANCE UNDER CONTRACTS. THIS INCLUDED

$672 MILLION REPRESENTING GUARANTEES OF NON-U.S. EXCISE TAXES AND CUSTOMS DUTIES

OF OTHER COMPANIES, ENTERED INTO AS A NORMAL BUSINESS PRACTICE, UNDER RECIPROCAL

ARRANGEMENTS. ALSO INCLUDED IN THIS AMOUNT WERE GUARANTEES BY CONSOLIDATED

AFFILIATES OF $1,641 MILLION, REPRESENTING EXXONMOBIL'S SHARE OF OBLIGATIONS OF

CERTAIN EQUITY COMPANIES.

ADDITIONALLY, THE CORPORATION AND ITS AFFILIATES HAVE NUMEROUS LONG-TERM

SALES AND PURCHASE COMMITMENTS IN THEIR VARIOUS BUSINESS ACTIVITIES, ALL OF

WHICH ARE EXPECTED TO BE FULFILLED WITH NO ADVERSE CONSEQUENCES MATERIAL TO THE

CORPORATION'S OPERATIONS OR FINANCIAL CONDITION. THE PRESENT VALUE OF

UNCONDITIONAL PURCHASE OBLIGATIONS WAS $1,296 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2001. ON

AN UNDISCOUNTED BASIS, INCLUDING IMPUTED INTEREST OF $733 MILLION, THESE

COMMITMENTS TOTALED $2,029 MILLION. UNCONDITIONAL PURCHASE OBLIGATIONS AS

DEFINED BY ACCOUNTING STANDARDS ARE THOSE LONG-TERM COMMITMENTS THAT ARE

NONCANCELABLE OR CANCELABLE ONLY UNDER CERTAIN CONDITIONS, AND THAT THIRD

PARTIES HAVE USED TO SECURE FINANCING FOR THE FACILITIES THAT WILL PROVIDE THE

CONTRACTED GOODS OR SERVICES.

THE OPERATIONS AND EARNINGS OF THE CORPORATION AND ITS AFFILIATES

THROUGHOUT THE WORLD HAVE BEEN, AND MAY IN THE FUTURE BE, AFFECTED FROM TIME TO

TIME IN VARYING DEGREE BY POLITICAL DEVELOPMENTS AND LAWS AND REGULATIONS, SUCH

AS FORCED DIVESTITURE OF ASSETS; RESTRICTIONS ON PRODUCTION, IMPORTS AND

EXPORTS; PRICE CONTROLS; TAX INCREASES AND RETROACTIVE TAX CLAIMS; EXPROPRIATION

OF PROPERTY; CANCELLATION OF CONTRACT RIGHTS AND ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS. BOTH

THE LIKELIHOOD OF SUCH OCCURRENCES AND THEIR OVERALL EFFECT UPON THE CORPORATION

VARY GREATLY FROM COUNTRY TO COUNTRY AND ARE NOT PREDICTABLE.

A DISCOUNT RATE AT WHICH POSTRETIREMENT LIABILITIES COULD BE EFFECTIVELY

SETTLED. THE DISCOUNT RATE FOR CALCULATING YEAR-END POSTRETIREMENT LIABILITIES

IS BASED ON THE YEAR-END RATE OF INTEREST ON HIGH QUALITY BONDS. THE RETURN ON

THE ANNUITY FUND'S ACTUAL PORTFOLIO OF ASSETS HAS HISTORICALLY BEEN HIGHER THAN

BONDS AS THE MAJORITY OF PENSION ASSETS ARE INVESTED IN EQUITIES. THE ACTUAL

RATE EARNED IN THE U.S. OVER THE PAST DECADE HAS BEEN 12 PERCENT. ALL FUNDED

U.S. PLANS ARE FULLY FUNDED IN 2001 UNDER THE STANDARDS SET BY THE DEPARTMENT OF

LABOR AND THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE. THE CORPORATION WILL CONTINUE TO MAKE

CONTRIBUTIONS AS NECESSARY TO MAINTAIN THE FULLY FUNDED STATUS OF THESE PLANS

ACCORDING TO THOSE STANDARDS. CERTAIN SMALLER U.S. PLANS AND A NUMBER OF

NON-U.S. PLANS ARE NOT FUNDED BECAUSE LOCAL TAX CONVENTIONS AND REGULATORY

PRACTICES DO NOT ENCOURAGE FUNDING OF THESE PLANS. BOOK RESERVES HAVE BEEN

ESTABLISHED FOR THESE PLANS TO PROVIDE FOR FUTURE BENEFIT PAYMENTS. ALL DEFINED

BENEFIT PENSION OBLIGATIONS, REGARDLESS OF THE FUNDING STATUS OF THE UNDERLYING

PLANS, ARE FULLY SUPPORTED BY THE FINANCIAL STRENGTH OF THE CORPORATION OR THE

RESPECTIVE SPONSORING AFFILIATE.
