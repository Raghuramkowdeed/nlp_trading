item1.  business
exxon mobil corporation was incorporated in the state of
new jersey in 1882. divisions and affiliated companies of exxonmobil operate or
market products in the united states and most other countries of the world.
their principal business is energy, involving exploration for, and production
of, crude oil and natural gas, manufacture of petroleum products and
transportation and sale of crude oil, natural gas and petroleum products.
exxonmobil is a major manufacturer and marketer of commodity petrochemicals, including
olefins, aromatics, polyethylene and polypropylene plastics and a wide variety of
specialty products. affiliates of exxonmobil conduct extensive research
programs in support of these businesses.
exxon mobil corporation has several
divisions and hundreds of affiliates, many with names that include exxonmobil,
exxon, esso, mobil or xto. for convenience and simplicity,
in this report the terms exxonmobil, exxon, esso, mobil and xto,
as well as terms like corporation, company, our, we
and its, are sometimes used as abbreviated references to specific
affiliates or groups of affiliates. the precise meaning depends on the context
in question.
throughout exxonmobils businesses, new
and ongoing measures are taken to prevent and minimize the impact of our
operations on air, water and ground. these include a significant investment in
refining infrastructure and technology to manufacture clean fuels, as well as
projects to monitor and reduce nitrogen oxide, sulfur oxide and greenhouse gas
emissions, and expenditures for asset retirement obligations. using definitions
and guidelines established by the american petroleum institute, exxonmobils
2014 worldwide environmental expenditures for all such preventative and
remediation steps, including exxonmobils share of equity company expenditures,
were $6.2billion, of which $3.5billion were included in expenses
with the remainder in capital expenditures. the total cost for such activities
is expected to remain in this range in 2015 and 2016 (with capital expenditures
approximately 40percent of the total).
the energy and petrochemical industries
are highly competitive. there is competition within the industries and also
with other industries in supplying the energy, fuel and chemical needs of both
industrial and individual consumers. the corporation competes with other firms
in the sale or purchase of needed goods and services in many national and international
markets and employs all methods of competition which are lawful and appropriate
for such purposes.
operating data and industry segment
information for the corporation are contained in the financial section of this
report under the following: quarterly information, note18: disclosures
about segments and related information and operating summary. information on
oil and gas reserves is contained in the oil and gas reserves part of the
supplemental information on oil and gas exploration and production activities
portion of the financial section of this report.
exxonmobil has a longstanding
commitment to the development of proprietary technology. we have a wide array
of research programs designed to meet the needs identified in each of our
business segments. information on company-sponsored research and development
spending is contained in note3: miscellaneous financial information of
the financial section of this report. exxonmobil held approximately 11thousand
active patents worldwide at the end of 2014. for technology licensed to third
parties, revenues totaled approximately $148million in 2014. although
technology is an important contributor to the overall operations and results of
our company, the profitability of each business segment is not dependent on any
individual patent, trade secret, trademark, license, franchise or concession.
the number of regular employees was 75.3thousand,
75.0thousand, and 76.9thousand at years ended 2014, 2013 and 2012,
respectively. regular employees are defined as active executive, management,
professional, technical and wage employees who work full time or part time for
the corporation and are covered by the corporations benefit plans and
programs. regular employees do not include employees of the company-operated retail
sites (cors). the number of cors employees was 8.4thousand, 9.8thousand,
and 11.1thousand at years ended 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
information concerning the source and
availability of raw materials used in the corporations business, the extent of
seasonality in the business, the possibility of renegotiation of profits or
termination of contracts at the election of governments and risks attendant to
foreign operations may be found in item 1arisk factors and item
2properties in this report.
exxonmobil maintains a website at
exxonmobil.com. our annual report on form10-k, quarterly reports on
form10-q, current reports on form 8-k and any amendments to those reports
filed or furnished pursuant to section13(a) of the securities exchange
act of 1934 are made available through our website as soon as reasonably practical
after we electronically file or furnish the reports to the securities and
exchange commission. also available on the corporations website are the
companys corporate governance guidelines and code of ethics and business
conduct, as well as the charters of the audit, compensation and nominating
committees of the board of directors. information on our website is not
incorporated into this report.
item1a. risk factors
exxonmobils financial and operating
results are subject to a variety of risks inherent in the global oil, gas, and
petrochemical businesses. many of these risk factors are not within the
companys control and could adversely affect our business, our financial and
operating results or our financial condition. these risk factors include:
supply and demand
the oil, gas, and petrochemical businesses are
fundamentally commodity businesses. this means exxonmobils operations and
earnings may be significantly affected by changes in oil, gas and petrochemical
prices and by changes in margins on refined products. oil, gas, petrochemical
and product prices and margins in turn depend on local, regional and global
events or conditions that affect supply and demand for the relevant commodity.
economic conditions. the demand for energy and petrochemicals correlates closely with
general economic growth rates. the occurrence of recessions or other periods of
low or negative economic growth will typically have a direct adverse impact on
our results. other factors that affect general economic conditions in the world
or in a major region, such as changes in population growth rates, periods of
civil unrest, government austerity programs, or currency exchange rate
fluctuations, can also impact the demand for energy and petrochemicals.
sovereign debt downgrades, defaults, inability to access debt markets due to
credit or legal constraints, liquidity crises, the breakup or restructuring of
fiscal, monetary, or political systems such as the european union, and other
events or conditions that impair the functioning of financial markets and
institutions also pose risks to exxonmobil, including risks to the safety of
our financial assets and to the ability of our partners and customers to
fulfill their commitments to exxonmobil.
other demand-related factors. other factors that may affect the demand for oil, gas
and petrochemicals, and therefore impact our results, include technological
improvements in energy efficiency; seasonal weather patterns, which affect the
demand for energy associated with heating and cooling; increased
competitiveness of alternative energy sources that have so far generally not
been competitive with oil and gas without the benefit of government subsidies
or mandates; and changes in technology or consumer preferences that alter fuel
choices, such as toward alternative fueled vehicles.
other supply-related factors. commodity prices and margins also vary depending on a
number of factors affecting supply. for example, increased supply from the
development of new oil and gas supply sources and technologies to enhance
recovery from existing sources tend to reduce commodity prices to the extent such
supply increases are not offset by commensurate growth in demand. similarly,
increases in industry refining or petrochemical manufacturing capacity tend to
reduce margins on the affected products. world oil, gas, and petrochemical
supply levels can also be affected by factors that reduce available supplies,
such as adherence by member countries to opec production quotas and the
occurrence of wars, hostile actions, natural disasters, disruptions in
competitors operations, or unexpected unavailability of distribution channels
that may disrupt supplies. technological change can also alter the relative
costs for competitors to find, produce, and refine oil and gas and to
manufacture petrochemicals.
other market factors. exxonmobils business results are also exposed to
potential negative impacts due to changes in interest rates, inflation,
currency exchange rates, and other local or regional market conditions. we
generally do not use financial instruments to hedge market exposures.
government and political factors
exxonmobils results can be adversely affected by
political or regulatory developments affecting our operations.
access limitations. a number of countries limit access to their oil and gas resources, or
may place resources off-limits from development altogether. restrictions on
foreign investment in the oil and gas sector tend to increase in times of high
commodity prices, when national governments may have less need of outside
sources of private capital. many countries also restrict the import or export
of certain products based on point of origin.
restrictions on doing business. exxonmobil is subject to laws and sanctions imposed
by the u.s. or by other jurisdictions where we do business that may prohibit
exxonmobil or certain of its affiliates from doing business in certain
countries, or restricting the kind of business that may be conducted. such
restrictions may provide a competitive advantage to competitors who may not be
subject to comparable restrictions.
lack of legal certainty. some countries in which we do business lack
well-developed legal systems, or have not yet adopted clear regulatory
frameworks for oil and gas development. lack of legal certainty exposes our
operations to increased risk of adverse or unpredictable actions by government
officials, and also makes it more difficult for us to enforce our contracts. in
some cases these risks can be partially offset by agreements to arbitrate
disputes in an international forum, but the adequacy of this remedy may still
depend on the local legal system to enforce an award.
regulatory and litigation risks.even in countries with well-developed legal
systems where exxonmobil does business, we remain exposed to changes in law
(including changes that result from international treaties and accords) that
could adversely affect our results, such as:
increases in taxes or government royalty rates
(including retroactive claims);
price controls;
changes in environmental regulations or other laws
that increase our cost of compliance or reduce or delay available business
opportunities (including changes in laws related to offshore drilling
operations, water use, or hydraulic fracturing);
adoption of regulations mandating the use of
alternative fuels or uncompetitive fuel components;
adoption of government payment transparency
regulations that could require us to disclose competitively sensitive
commercial information, or that could cause us to violate the non-disclosure
laws of other countries; and
government actions to cancel contracts,
re-denominate the official currency, renounce or default on obligations,
renegotiate terms unilaterally, or expropriate assets.
legal remedies available to compensate us for
expropriation or other takings may be inadequate.
we also may be adversely affected by the outcome of
litigation, especially in countries such as the united states in which very
large and unpredictable punitive damage awards may occur, or by government
enforcement proceedings alleging non-compliance with applicable laws or
regulations.
security concerns. successful operation of particular facilities or projects may be
disrupted by civil unrest, acts of sabotage or terrorism, and other local
security concerns. such concerns may require us to incur greater costs for
security or to shut down operations for a period of time.
climate change and greenhouse gas restrictions. due to concern over the risk of climate change, a
number of countries have adopted, or are considering the adoption of,
regulatory frameworks to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. these include
adoption of cap and trade regimes, carbon taxes, restrictive permitting,
increased efficiency standards, and incentives or mandates for renewable
energy. these requirements could make our products more expensive, lengthen
project implementation times, and reduce demand for hydrocarbons, as well as
shift hydrocarbon demand toward relatively lower-carbon sources such as natural
gas. current and pending greenhouse gas regulations may also increase our
compliance costs, such as for monitoring or sequestering emissions.
government sponsorship of alternative energy. many governments are providing tax advantages and
other subsidies to support alternative energy sources or are mandating the use
of specific fuels or technologies. governments are also promoting research into
new technologies to reduce the cost and increase the scalability of alternative
energy sources. we are conducting our own research efforts into alternative
energy, such as through sponsorship of the global climate and energy project at
stanford university and research into liquid products from algae and biomass
that can be further converted to transportation fuels. our future results may
depend in part on the success of our research efforts and on our ability to
adapt and apply the strengths of our current business model to providing the energy
products of the future in a cost-competitive manner. see management
effectiveness below.
management effectiveness
in addition to external economic and political
factors, our future business results also depend on our ability to manage
successfully those factors that are at least in part within our control. the
extent to which we manage these factors will impact our performance relative to
competition. for projects in which we are not the operator, we depend on the
management effectiveness of one or more co-venturers whom we do not control.
exploration and development program. our ability to maintain and grow our oil and gas
production depends on the success of our exploration and development efforts.
among other factors, we must continuously improve our ability to identify the
most promising resource prospects and apply our project management expertise to
bring discovered resources on line on schedule and within budget.
project management. the success of exxonmobils upstream, downstream, and chemical
businesses depends on complex, long-term, capital intensive projects. these
projects in turn require a high degree of project management expertise to
maximize efficiency. specific factors that can affect the performance of major
projects include our ability to: negotiate successfully with joint venturers,
partners, governments, suppliers, customers, or others; model and optimize
reservoir performance; develop markets for project outputs, whether through long-term
contracts or the development of effective spot markets; manage changes in
operating conditions and costs, including costs of third party equipment or
services such as drilling rigs and shipping; prevent, to the extent possible,
and respond effectively to unforeseen technical difficulties that could delay
project startup or cause unscheduled project downtime; and influence the
performance of project operators where exxonmobil does not perform that role.
the term project as used
in this report can refer to a variety of different activities and does not
necessarily have the same meaning as in any government payment transparency
reports.
operational efficiency. an important component of exxonmobils competitive
performance, especially given the commodity-based nature of many of our
businesses, is our ability to operate efficiently, including our ability to
manage expenses and improve production yields on an ongoing basis. this
requires continuous management focus, including technology improvements, cost
control, productivity enhancements, regular reappraisal of our asset portfolio,
and the recruitment, development and retention of high caliber employees.
research and development. to maintain our competitive position, especially in
light of the technological nature of our businesses and the need for continuous
efficiency improvement, exxonmobils research and development organizations
must be successful and able to adapt to a changing market and policy
environment.
safety, business controls, and environmental risk
management. our results depend on
managements ability to minimize the inherent risks of oil, gas, and
petrochemical operations, to control effectively our business activities and to
minimize the potential for human error. we apply rigorous management systems
and continuous focus to workplace safety and to avoiding spills or other
adverse environmental events. for example, we work to minimize spills through a
combined program of effective operations integrity management, ongoing
upgrades, key equipment replacements, and comprehensive inspection and
surveillance. similarly, we are implementing cost-effective new technologies
and adopting new operating practices to reduce air emissions, not only in
response to government requirements but also to address community priorities.
we also maintain a disciplined framework of internal controls and apply a
controls management system for monitoring compliance with this framework.
substantial liabilities and other adverse impacts could result if our management
systems and controls do not function as intended. the ability to insure against
such risks is limited by the capacity of the applicable insurance markets,
which may not be sufficient.
business risks also include the risk of cybersecurity
breaches. if our systems for protecting against cybersecurity risks prove not
to be sufficient, exxonmobil could be adversely affected such as by having its
business systems compromised, its proprietary information altered, lost or
stolen, or its business operations disrupted.
preparedness.
our operations may be disrupted by severe weather events, natural disasters,
human error, and similar events. for example, hurricanes may damage our
offshore production facilities or coastal refining and petrochemical plants in
vulnerable areas. our ability to mitigate the adverse impacts of these events
depends in part upon the effectiveness of our rigorous disaster preparedness
and response planning, as well as business continuity planning.
projections, estimates and descriptions of
exxonmobils plans and objectives included or incorporated in items 1, 1a, 2, 7
and 7a of this report are forward-looking statements. actual future results,
including project completion dates, production rates, capital expenditures,
costs and business plans could differ materially due to, among other things,
the factors discussed above and elsewhere in this report.

cubic feet of natural gas.
in the preceding reserves information, consolidated subsidiary and
equity company reserves are reported separately. however, the corporation
operates its business with the same view of equity company reserves as it has
for reserves from consolidated subsidiaries.
the corporations overall volume capacity
outlook, based on projects coming on stream as anticipated, is for production
capacity to grow over the coming years. however, actual volumes will vary from
year to year due to the timing of individual project start-ups, operational
outages, reservoir performance, regulatory changes, the impact of fiscal and
commercial terms, asset sales, weather events, price effects on production sharing
contracts and other factors as described in item 1arisk factors of this
report.
the estimation of proved reserves, which
is based on the requirement of reasonable certainty, is an ongoing process
based on rigorous technical evaluations, commercial and market assessments and
detailed analysis of well and reservoir information such as flow rates and
reservoir pressure declines. furthermore, the corporation only records proved
reserves for projects which have received significant funding commitments by
management made toward the development of the reserves. although the
corporation is reasonably certain that proved reserves will be produced, the
timing and amount recovered can be affected by a number of factors including
completion of development projects, reservoir performance, regulatory approvals
and significant changes in projections of long-term oil and gas price levels.
b. technologies used in
establishing proved reserves additions in 2014
additions to exxonmobils proved reserves in 2014 were
based on estimates generated through the integration of available and appropriate
geological, engineering and production data, utilizing well-established
technologies that have been demonstrated in the field to yield repeatable and
consistent results.
data used in these integrated assessments
included information obtained directly from the subsurface via wellbores, such
as well logs, reservoir core samples, fluid samples, static and dynamic
pressure information, production test data, and surveillance and performance
information. the data utilized also included subsurface information obtained
through indirect measurements including high-quality 3-d and 4-d seismic data,
calibrated with available well control information. the tools used to interpret
the data included proprietary seismic processing software, proprietary
reservoir modeling and simulation software, and commercially available data
analysis packages.
in some circumstances, where appropriate
analog reservoirs were available, reservoir parameters from these analogs were
used to increase the quality of and confidence in the reserves estimates.
c. qualifications of
reserves technical oversight group and internal controls over proved reserves
exxonmobil has a dedicated global reserves group that
provides technical oversight and is separate from the operating organization.
primary responsibilities of this group include oversight of the reserves
estimation process for compliance with securities and exchange commission (sec)
rules and regulations, review of annual changes in reserves estimates, and the
reporting of exxonmobils proved reserves. this group also maintains the
official company reserves estimates for exxonmobils proved reserves of crude
and natural gas liquids, bitumen, synthetic oil and natural gas. in addition,
the group provides training to personnel involved in the reserves estimation
and reporting process within exxonmobil and its affiliates. the manager of the
global reserves group has more than 30 years of experience in reservoir
engineering and reserves assessment and has a degree in engineering. he is an
active member of the society of petroleum engineers (spe) and previously served
on the spe oil and gas reserves committee. the group is managed by and staffed
with individuals that have an average of more than 20 years of technical
experience in the petroleum industry, including expertise in the classification
and categorization of reserves under the sec guidelines. this group includes
individuals who hold advanced degrees in either engineering or geology. several
members of the group hold professional registrations in their field of expertise,
and members have served on the spe oil and gas reserves committee.
the global reserves group maintains a
central database containing the official company reserves estimates.
appropriate controls, including limitations on database access and update
capabilities, are in place to ensure data integrity within this central
database. an annual review of the systems controls is performed by internal
audit. key components of the reserves estimation process include technical
evaluations and analysis of well and field performance and a rigorous peer
review. no changes may be made to the reserves estimates in the central
database, including additions of any new initial reserves estimates or
subsequent revisions, unless these changes have been thoroughly reviewed and
evaluated by duly authorized personnel within the operating organization. in
addition, changes to reserves estimates that exceed certain thresholds require
further review and approval of the appropriate level of management within the
operating organization before the changes may be made in the central database.
endorsement by the global reserves group for all proved reserves changes is a
mandatory component of this review process. after all changes are made, reviews
are held with senior management for final endorsement.
2. proved undeveloped reserves
at year-end 2014, approximately 8.8 billion oil-equivalent
barrels (goeb) of exxonmobils proved reserves were classified as proved
undeveloped. this represents 35 percent of the 25.3 goeb reported in proved
reserves. this compares to the 8.5 goeb of proved undeveloped reserves reported
at the end of 2013. during the year, exxonmobil conducted development
activities in over 100 fields that resulted in the transfer of approximately
0.8 goeb from proved undeveloped to proved developed reserves by year-end. the
largest transfers were related to papua new guinea (png) lng start-up and
drilling activity in the united states.
one of exxonmobils requirements for
reporting proved reserves is that management has made significant funding
commitments toward the development of the reserves. exxonmobil has a
disciplined investment strategy and many major fields require long lead-time in
order to be developed. development projects typically take two to four years
from the time of recording proved undeveloped reserves to the start of
production. however, the development time for large and complex projects can
exceed five years. during 2014, discoveries and extensions related to new
projects added approximately 0.6 goeb of proved undeveloped reserves. the
largest of these additions were related to planned drilling in the united
states and project funding in angola, russia and kazakhstan. overall,
investments of $24.2 billion were made by the corporation during 2014 to
progress the development of reported proved undeveloped reserves, including $22.4
billion for oil and gas producing activities and an additional $1.8 billion for
other non-oil and gas producing activities such as the construction of support
infrastructure and other related facilities. these investments represented 74
percent of the $32.7 billion in total reported upstream capital and exploration
expenditures.
proved undeveloped reserves in australia,
the united states, kazakhstan, nigeria, and the netherlands have remained
undeveloped for five years or more primarily due to constraints on the capacity
of infrastructure, the pace of co-venturer/government funding, as well as the time
required to complete development for very large projects. the corporation is
reasonably certain that these proved reserves will be produced; however, the
timing and amount recovered can be affected by a number of factors including
completion of development projects, reservoir performance, regulatory
approvals, and significant changes in long-term oil and gas price levels. of
the proved undeveloped reserves that have been reported for five or more years,
84 percent are contained in the aforementioned countries. the largest of these
is related to lng/gas projects in australia, where construction of the gorgon
lng project is under way. in kazakhstan, the proved undeveloped reserves are
related to the remainder of the initial development of the offshore kashagan
field which is included in the north caspian production sharing agreement and
the tengizchevroil joint venture which includes a production license in the
tengiz  korolev field complex. the tengizchevroil joint venture is producing,
and proved undeveloped reserves will continue to move to proved developed as
approved development phases progress. in the netherlands, the groningen gas
field has proved undeveloped reserves reported that are related to installation
of future stages of compression. these reserves will move to proved developed
when the additional stages of compression are installed to maintain field
delivery pressure.

average production prices have been calculated by using
sales quantities from the corporations own production as the divisor. average
production costs have been computed by using net production quantities for the
divisor. the volumes of crude oil and natural gas liquids (ngl) production used
for this computation are shown in the oil and gas production table in section
3.a. the volumes of natural gas used in the calculation are the production
volumes of natural gas available for sale and are also shown in section 3.a.
the natural gas available for sale volumes are different from those shown in
the reserves table in the oil and gas reserves part of the supplemental
information on oil and gas exploration and production activities portion of
the financial section of this report due to volumes consumed or flared. gas is
converted to an oil-equivalent basis at six million cubic feet per one thousand
barrels.

b. exploratory and development activities regarding oil and gas
resources extracted by mining technologies
syncrude operations. syncrude is a joint venture established to
recover shallow deposits of oil sands using open-pit mining methods to extract
the crude bitumen, and then upgrade it to produce a high-quality, light (32
degrees api), sweet, synthetic crude oil. imperial oil limited is the owner of
a 25 percent interest in the joint venture. exxon mobil corporation has a 69.6
percent interest in imperial oil limited. in 2014, the companys share of net
production of synthetic crude oil was about 60 thousand barrels per day and
share of net acreage was about 63thousand acres in the athabasca oil
sands deposit.
kearl project. the kearl project is a joint venture
established to recover shallow deposits of oil sands using open-pit mining
methods to extract the crude bitumen. imperial oil limited holds a 70.96
percent interest in the joint venture and exxonmobil canada properties holds
the other 29.04 percent. exxon mobil corporation has a 69.6 percent interest in
imperial oil limited and a 100 percent interest in exxonmobil canada
properties. kearl is comprised of six oil sands leases covering about 48
thousand acres in the athabasca oil sands deposit.
the kearl project is located approximately
40 miles north of fort mcmurray, alberta, canada. bitumen is extracted from oil
sands produced from open-pit mining operations, and processed through a bitumen
extraction and froth treatment train. the product, a blend of bitumen and
diluent, is shipped to our refineries and to other third parties. diluent is
natural gas condensate or other light hydrocarbons added to the crude bitumen
to facilitate transportation by pipeline. during 2014, average net production
at kearl was 66 thousand barrels per day. the kearl expansion project was
essentially complete at the end of 2014, and the commissioning of facilities
commenced in preparation for start-up.

exxonmobil sells crude oil and natural gas
from its producing operations under a variety of contractual obligations, some
of which may specify the delivery of a fixed and determinable quantity for
periods longer than one year. exxonmobil also enters into natural gas sales
contracts where the source of the natural gas used to fulfill the contract can
be a combination of our own production and the spot market. worldwide, we are
contractually committed to deliver approximately 18 million barrels of oil and
2,800 billion cubic feet of natural gas for the period from 2015 through 2017.
we expect to fulfill the majority of these delivery commitments with production
from our proved developed reserves. any remaining commitments will be fulfilled
with production from our proved undeveloped reserves and spot market purchases
as necessary.

note: year-end 2013 gross developed and
undeveloped acreage in canada/south america was restated.
exxonmobils investment in developed and undeveloped
acreage is comprised of numerous concessions, blocks and leases. the terms and
conditions under which the corporation maintains exploration and/or production
rights to the acreage are property-specific, contractually defined and vary
significantly from property to property. work programs are designed to ensure
that the exploration potential of any property is fully evaluated before
expiration. in some instances, the corporation may elect to relinquish acreage
in advance of the contractual expiration date if the evaluation process is
complete and there is not a business basis for extension. in cases where
additional time may be required to fully evaluate acreage, the corporation has
generally been successful in obtaining extensions. the scheduled expiration of
leases and concessions for undeveloped acreage over the next three years is not
expected to have a material adverse impact on the corporation.
d. summary of acreage terms
united states
oil and gas leases have an exploration period ranging from
one to ten years, and a production period that normally remains in effect until
production ceases. under certain circumstances, a lease may be held beyond its
exploration term even if production has not commenced. in some instances, a
fee interest is acquired where both the surface and the underlying mineral
interests are owned outright.
canada/south
america
canada
exploration licenses or leases in onshore areas are
acquired for varying periods of time with renewals or extensions possible.
these licenses or leases entitle the holder to continue existing licenses or
leases upon completing specified work. in general, these license and lease agreements
are held as long as there is production on the licenses and leases. exploration
licenses in offshore eastern canada and the beaufort sea are held by work
commitments of various amounts and rentals. they are valid for a maximum term
of nine years. production licenses in the offshore are valid for 25 years, with
rights of extension for continued production. significant discovery licenses in
the offshore, relating to currently undeveloped discoveries, do not have a
definite term.
argentina
the federal hydrocarbon law was amended in december 2014.
the onshore concession terms granted prior to the amendment are up to six
years, divided into three potential exploration periods, with an optional
extension for up to one year depending on the classification of the area.
pursuant to the amended law, the production term for a conventional production
concession would be 25 years, and 35 years for an unconventional concession,
with unlimited ten-year extensions possible, once a field has been developed.
europe
germany
exploration concessions are granted for an initial maximum
period of five years, with an unlimited number of extensions of up to three
years each. extensions are subject to specific, minimum work commitments.
production licenses are normally granted for 20 to 25 years with multiple
possible extensions as long as there is production on the license.
netherlands
under the mining law, effective january 1, 2003,
exploration and production licenses for both onshore and offshore areas are
issued for a period as explicitly defined in the license. the term is based on
the period of time necessary to perform the activities for which the license is
issued. license conditions are stipulated in the license and are based on the
mining law.
production rights granted prior to january
1, 2003, remain subject to their existing terms, and differ slightly for
onshore and offshore areas. onshore production licenses issued prior to 1988
were indefinite; from 1988 they were issued for a period as explicitly defined
in the license, ranging from 35 to 45 years. offshore production licenses
issued before 1976 were issued for a fixed period of 40 years; from 1976 they
were again issued for a period as explicitly defined in the license, ranging
from 15 to 40 years.
norway
licenses issued prior to 1972 were for an initial period of
six years and an extension period of 40 years, with relinquishment of at least
one-fourth of the original area required at the end of the sixth year and
another one-fourth at the end of the ninth year. licenses issued between 1972
and 1997 were for an initial period of up to six years (with extension of the
initial period of one year at a time up to ten years after 1985), and an
extension period of up to 30 years, with relinquishment of at least one-half of
the original area required at the end of the initial period. licenses issued
after july 1, 1997, have an initial period of up to ten years and a normal
extension period of up to 30 years or in special cases of up to 50 years, and
with relinquishment of at least one-half of the original area required at the
end of the initial period.
united
kingdom
acreage terms are fixed by the government and are
periodically changed. for example, many of the early licenses issued under the
first four licensing rounds provided for an initial term of six years with
relinquishment of at least one-half of the original area at the end of the
initial term, subject to extension for a further 40 years. at the end of any
such 40-year term, licenses may continue in producing areas until cessation of
production; or licenses may continue in development areas for periods agreed on
a case-by-case basis until they become producing areas; or licenses terminate
in all other areas. the licensing regime was last updated in 2002, and the
majority of licenses issued have an initial term of four years with a second
term extension of four years and a final term of 18 years with a mandatory
relinquishment of 50 percent of the acreage after the initial term and of all
acreage that is not covered by a development plan at the end of the second term.
africa
angola
exploration and production activities are governed by
production sharing agreements with an initial exploration term of four years
and an optional second phase of two to three years. the production period is
for 25 years, and agreements generally provide for a negotiated extension.
chad
exploration permits are issued for a period of five years,
and are renewable for one or two further five-year periods. the terms and
conditions of the permits, including relinquishment obligations, are specified
in a negotiated convention. the production term is for 30 years and may be
extended at the discretion of the government.
equatorial guinea
exploration and production activities are governed by
production sharing contracts negotiated with the state ministry of mines,
industry and energy. the exploration periods are for 10 to 15 years with
limited relinquishments in the absence of commercial discoveries. the
production period for crude oil is 30 years, while the production period for
gas is 50 years. under the hydrocarbons law enacted in 2006, the exploration
terms for new production sharing contracts are four to five years with a
maximum of two one-year extensions, unless the ministry agrees otherwise.
nigeria
exploration and production activities in the deepwater
offshore areas are typically governed by production sharing contracts (pscs)
with the national oil company, the nigerian national petroleum corporation (nnpc).
nnpc holds the underlying oil prospecting license (opl) and any resulting oil
mining lease (oml). the terms of the pscs are generally 30 years, including a
ten-year exploration period (an initial exploration phase that can be divided
into multiple optional periods) covered by an opl. upon commercial discovery,
an opl may be converted to an oml. partial relinquishment is required under the
psc at the end of the ten-year exploration period, and omls have a 20-year
production period that may be extended.
some exploration activities are carried
out in deepwater by joint ventures with local companies holding interests in an
opl. opls in deepwater offshore areas are valid for ten years, while in all
other areas the licenses are for five years. demonstrating a commercial
discovery is the basis for conversion of an opl to an oml.
omls granted prior to the 1969 petroleum
act (i.e., under the mineral oils act 1914, repealed by the 1969 petroleum act)
were for 30 years onshore and 40 years in offshore areas and have been renewed,
effective december 1, 2008, for a further period of 20 years, with a further
renewal option of 20 years. operations under these pre-1969 omls are conducted
under a joint venture agreement with nnpc rather than a psc. commercial terms
applicable to the existing joint venture oil production are defined by the
petroleum profits tax act.
omls granted under the 1969 petroleum act,
which include all deepwater omls, have a maximum term of 20 years without
distinction for onshore or offshore location and are renewable, upon 12 months
written notice, for another period of 20 years. omls not held by nnpc are also
subject to a mandatory 50-percent relinquishment after the first ten years of
their duration.
asia
azerbaijan
the production sharing agreement (psa) for the development
of the azeri-chirag-gunashli field is established for an initial period of 30
years starting from the psa execution date in 1994.
other exploration and production
activities are governed by psas negotiated with the national oil company of
azerbaijan. the exploration period consists of three or four years with the
possibility of a one to three-year extension. the production period, which
includes development, is for 25 years or 35 years with the possibility of one
or two five-year extensions.
indonesia
exploration and production activities in indonesia are
generally governed by cooperation contracts, usually in the form of a
production sharing contract (psc), negotiated with bpmigas, a government agency
established in 2002 to manage upstream oil and gas activities. in 2012,
indonesias constitutional court ruled certain articles of law relating to
bpmigas to be unconstitutional, but stated that all existing pscs signed with
bpmigas should remain in force until their expiry, and the functions and duties
previously performed by bpmigas are to be carried out by the relevant ministry
of the government of indonesia until the promulgation of a new oil and gas law.
by presidential decree, skkmigas became the interim successor to bpmigas. the
current pscs have an exploration period of six years, which can be extended up
to 10 years, and an exploitation period of 20 years. pscs generally require the
contractor to relinquish 10 percent to 20 percent of the contract area after
three years and generally allow the contractor to retain no more than 50
percent to 80 percent of the original contract area after six years, depending
on the acreage and terms.
iraq
development and production activities in the state-owned
oil and gas fields are governed by contracts with regional oil companies of the
iraqi ministry of oil. an exxonmobil affiliate entered into a contract with
south oil company of the iraqi ministry of oil for the rights to participate in
the development and production activities of the west qurna phasei oil
and gas field effective march 1, 2010. the term of the contract is 20 years
with the right to extend for five years. the contract provides for cost
recovery plus per-barrel fees for incremental production above specified levels.
exploration and production activities in
the kurdistan region of iraq are governed by production sharing contracts
negotiated with the regional government of kurdistan in 2011. the exploration
term is for five years with the possibility of two-year extensions. the
production period is 20 years with the right to extend for five years.
kazakhstan
onshore exploration and production activities are governed
by the production license, exploration license and joint venture agreements
negotiated with the republic of kazakhstan. existing production operations have
a 40-year production period that commenced in 1993.
offshore exploration and production
activities are governed by a production sharing agreement negotiated with the
republic of kazakhstan. the exploration period is six years followed by
separate appraisal periods for each discovery. the production period for each
discovery, which includes development, is for 20 years from the date of declaration
of commerciality with the possibility of two ten-year extensions.
malaysia
production activities are governed by production sharing
contracts (pscs) negotiated with the national oil company. the pscs have terms
ranging up to 29 years. all extensions are subject to the national oil
companys prior written approval. the total production period is 15 to 29
years, depending on the date of the execution of the contract and the date of
first commercial lifting.
qatar
the state of qatar grants gas production development
project rights to develop and supply gas from the offshore north field to
permit the economic development and production of gas reserves sufficient to
satisfy the gas and lng sales obligations of these projects.
republic of yemen
the jannah production sharing agreement has a development
period extending 20 years from first commercial declaration, which was made in
june 1995.
russia
terms for exxonmobils sakhalin acreage are fixed by the
production sharing agreement (psa) that became effective in 1996 between the
russian government and the sakhalin-1 consortium, of which exxonmobil is the
operator. the term of the psa is 20 years from the declaration of commerciality,
which would be 2021. the term may be extended thereafter in ten-year increments
as specified in the psa.
exploration and production activities in
the kara, laptev, chukchi and black seas are governed by joint venture
agreements concluded with rosneft in 2013 and 2014 that cover certain of
rosnefts offshore licenses. the kara sea licenses covered by the joint venture
agreements concluded in 2013 extend through 2040 and include an exploration
period through 2020. additional licenses in the kara, laptev and chukchi seas
covered by the joint venture agreements concluded in 2014 extend through 2043
and include an exploration period through 2023. the kara, laptev and chukchi
sea licenses require development plan submission within eight years of a
discovery and development activities within five years of plan approval. the
black sea exploration license extends through 2017 and a discovery is the basis
for obtaining a license for production. refer to the relevant portion of note
7: equity company information of the financial section of this report for
additional information on the corporations participation in rosneft joint
venture activities.
thailand
the petroleum act of 1971 allows production under
exxonmobils concession for 30 years with a ten-year extension at terms
generally prevalent at the time.
united arab emirates
exploration and production activities for the major onshore
oil fields in the emirate of abu dhabi were governed by a 75-year oil
concession agreement executed in 1939, which expired in january 2014. an
interest in the development and production activities of the upper zakum field,
a major offshore field, was acquired effective as of january 2006, for a term
expiring march 2026, and in 2013 the governing agreements were extended to
2041.
australia/oceania
australia
exploration and production activities conducted offshore in
commonwealth waters are governed by federal legislation. exploration permits
are granted for an initial term of six years with two possible five-year
renewal periods. retention leases may be granted for resources that are not
commercially viable at the time of application, but are expected to become
commercially viable within 15 years. these are granted for periods of five
years and renewals may be requested. prior to july 1998, production licenses
were granted initially for 21 years, with a further renewal of 21 years and
thereafter indefinitely, i.e., for the life of the field. effective from july
1998, new production licenses are granted indefinitely. in each case, a
production license may be terminated if no production operations have been
carried on for five years.
papua new guinea
exploration and production activities are governed by the
oil and gas act. petroleum prospecting licenses are granted for an initial term

proceedings
regarding
the discussions between chalmette refining llc (crllc), owner of the chalmette
refinery (operated by exxonmobil oil corporation), and the louisiana department
of environmental quality (ldeq) to resolve self-reported deviations from
refinery operations and relating to certain clean air act title v permit
conditions, limits and other requirements reported in the corporations form
10-q for the second quarter of 2012, on november 14, 2014, crllc received a
consolidated compliance order and notice of potential penalty (cco/nopp) from
ldeq covering the deviations between 2009 and 2010. crllc and ldeq have entered
a dispute resolution agreement, which suspends enforcement of the cco/nopp
while negotiations are ongoing.
regarding allegations raised by ldeq concerning the april
28, 2012, discharge of crude oil from the exxonmobil pipeline companys (empco)
north line pipeline near torbert in pointe coupee parish, louisiana, previously
reported in the corporations forms 10-q for the third quarter of 2013 and the
third quarter of 2014, on december 9, 2014, ldeq notified empco that it was
seeking a penalty assessment of $471,000 related to the discharge. empco has
timely requested an adjudicatory hearing on disputed issues of fact and law
related to the proposed penalty assessment.
with respect to the enforcement action filed by the united
states, on behalf of the united states environmental protection agency (usepa),
and the state of arkansas, on behalf of the arkansas department of
environmental quality, against empco related to the discharge of crude oil from
the pegasus pipeline in mayflower, faulkner county, arkansas, previously

frequently used terms
listed below are definitions of several of
exxonmobils key business and financial performance measures. these definitions
are provided to facilitate understanding of the terms and their calculation.
cash flow from operations and asset sales
cash
flow from operations and asset sales is the sum of the net cash provided by
operating activities and proceeds associated with sales of subsidiaries,
property, plant and equipment, and sales and returns of investments from the
consolidated statement of cash flows. this cash flow reflects the total sources
of cash from both operating the corporations assets and from the divesting of
assets. the corporation employs a long-standing and regular disciplined review
process to ensure that all assets are contributing to the corporations
strategic objectives. assets are divested when they are no longer meeting these
objectives or are worth considerably more to others. because of the regular
nature of this activity, we believe it is useful for investors to consider
proceeds associated with asset sales together with cash provided by operating
activities when evaluating cash available for investment in the business and
financing activities, including shareholder distributions.

how the capital is used by the businesses, it includes exxonmobils net share
of property, plant and equipment and other assets less liabilities, excluding
both short-term and long-term debt. when viewed from the perspective of the
sources of capital employed in total for the corporation, it includes
exxonmobils share of total debt and equity. both of these views include
exxonmobils share of amounts applicable to equity companies, which the
corporation believes should be included to provide a more comprehensive measure
of capital employed.

return on
average capital employed
return
on average capital employed (roce) is a performance measure ratio. from the
perspective of the business segments, roce is annual business segment earnings
divided by average business segment capital employed (average of beginning and
end-of-year amounts). these segment earnings include exxonmobils share of
segment earnings of equity companies, consistent with our capital employed
definition, and exclude the cost of financing. the corporations total roce is
net income attributable to exxonmobil excluding the after-tax cost of
financing, divided by total corporate average capital employed. the corporation
has consistently applied its roce definition for many years and views it as the
best measure of historical capital productivity in our capital-intensive,
long-term industry, both to evaluate managements performance and to
demonstrate to shareholders that capital has been used wisely over the long
term. additional measures, which are more cash flow based, are used to make
investment decisions.

overview
the
following discussion and analysis of exxonmobils financial results, as well as
the accompanying financial statements and related notes to consolidated
financial statements to which they refer, are the responsibility of the
management of exxon mobil corporation. the corporations accounting and
financial reporting fairly reflect its straightforward business model involving
the extracting, manufacturing and marketing of hydrocarbons and
hydrocarbon-based products. the corporations business model involves the
production (or purchase), manufacture and sale of physical products, and all
commercial activities are directly in support of the underlying physical
movement ofgoods.
exxonmobil, with its resource base, financial strength,
disciplined investment approach and technology portfolio, is well-positioned to
participate in substantial investments to develop new energy supplies. while
commodity prices are volatile on a short-term basis and depend on supply and
demand, exxonmobils investment decisions are based on our long-term business
outlook, using a disciplined approach in selecting and pursuing the most
attractive investment opportunities. the corporate plan is a fundamental annual
management process that is the basis for setting near-term operating and
capital objectives in addition to providing the longer-term economic
assumptions used for investment evaluation purposes. volumes are based on
individual field production profiles, which are also updated annually. price
ranges for crude oil, natural gas, refined products, and chemical products are
based on corporate plan assumptions developed annually by major region and are utilized
for investment evaluation purposes. potential investment opportunities are evaluated
over a wide range of economic scenarios to establish the resiliency of each
opportunity. once investments are made, a reappraisal process is completed to
ensure relevant lessons are learned and improvements are incorporated into
future projects.
business environment and risk assessment
long-term business outlook
by
2040, the worlds population is projected to grow to approximately 9billion
people, or about 2billion more than in 2010. coincident with this
population increase, the corporation expects worldwide economic growth to
average close to 3percent per year. as economies and populations grow,
and as living standards improve for billions of people, the need for energy
will continue to rise. even with significant efficiency gains, global energy
demand is projected to rise by about 35percent from 2010 to 2040. this
demand increase is expected to be concentrated in developing countries (i.e.,
those that are not member nations of the organisation for economic co-operation
and development).
as expanding prosperity drives global energy demand higher,
increasing use of energy-efficient and lower-emission fuels, technologies and
practices will continue to help significantly reduce energy consumption and
emissions per unit of economic output over time. substantial efficiency gains are
likely in all key aspects of the worlds economy through 2040, affecting energy
requirements for transportation, power generation, industrial applications, and
residential and commercial needs.
energy for transportation  including cars, trucks, ships,
trains and airplanes  is expected to increase by about 40percent from
2010 to 2040. the growth in transportation energy demand is likely to account
for approximately 60percent of the growth in liquid fuels demand worldwide
over this period. nearly all the worlds transportation fleets will continue to
run on liquid fuels, which are abundant, widely available, easy to transport,
and provide a large quantity of energy in small volumes.
demand for electricity around the world is likely to
increase approximately 85percent by 2040, led by growth in developing
countries. consistent with this projection, power generation is expected to
remain the largest and fastest-growing major segment of global energy demand.
meeting the expected growth in power demand will require a diverse set of
energy sources. natural gas demand is likely to grow most significantly and
become the leading source of generated electricity by 2040, reflecting the
efficiency of gas-fired power plants. today, coal has the largest fuel share in
the power sector, but its share is likely to decline significantly by 2040 as
policies are gradually adopted to reduce environmental impacts including those
related to local air quality and greenhouse gas emissions. nuclear power and
renewables, led by hydropower and wind, are also expected to grow significantly
over the period.
managements discussion and analysis of
financial condition and results of operations
liquid fuels provide the largest share of global
energy supplies today due to their broad-based availability, affordability and
ease of transportation, distribution and storage to meet consumer needs. by
2040, global demand for liquid fuels is expected to grow to approximately 115million
barrels of oilequivalent per day, an increase of almost 30percent
from 2010. globally, crude production from traditional conventional sources
will likely decrease slightly through 2040, with significant development
activity mostly offsetting natural declines from these fields. however, this
decrease is expected to be more than offset by rising production from a variety
of emerging supply sources  including tight oil, deepwater, oil sands, natural
gas liquids and biofuels. the worlds resource base is sufficient to meet
projected demand through 2040 as technology advances continue to expand the
availability of economic supply options. however, access to resources and
timely investments will remain critical to meeting global needs with reliable,
affordable supplies.
natural gas is a versatile fuel, suitable for a wide
variety of applications, and is expected to be the fastest growing major fuel
source through 2040. global demand is expected to rise about 65percent
from 2010 to 2040, with about half of that increase in the asia pacific region.
helping meet these needs will be significant growth in supplies of
unconventional gas  the natural gas found in shale and other rock formations
that was once considered uneconomic to produce. about two-thirds of the growth
in natural gas supplies is expected to be from unconventional sources, which
will account for close to 35percent of global gas supplies by 2040. the
worldwide liquefied natural gas (lng) market is expected to more than triple by
2040, stimulated by growing natural gas demand.
the worlds energy mix is highly diverse and will remain so
through 2040. oil is expected to remain the largest source of energy with its
share remaining close to one-third in 2040. coal is currently the second
largest source of energy, but it is likely to lose that position to natural gas
in the 2025-2030 timeframe. the share of natural gas is expected to exceed 25percent
by 2040, while the share of coal falls to less than 20percent. nuclear
power is projected to grow significantly, as many nations expand nuclear
capacity to address rising electricity needs as well as energy security and
environmental issues. total renewable energy is likely to reach about 15percent
of total energy by 2040, with biomass, hydro and geothermal contributing a
combined share of more than 10percent. total energy supplied from wind,
solar and biofuels is expected to increase close to 450percent from 2010
to 2040, when they will be approaching 4percent of world energy.
the corporation anticipates that the worlds available oil
and gas resource base will grow not only from new discoveries, but also from
reserve increases in previously discovered fields. technology will underpin
these increases. the cost to develop and supply these resources will be
significant. according to the international energy agency, the investment
required to meet total oil and gas energy needs worldwide over the period 20142040
will be about $28trillion (measured in 2013 dollars) or more than $1trillion
per year on average.
international accords and underlying regional and national
regulations covering greenhouse gas emissions are evolving with uncertain
timing and outcome, making it difficult to predict their business impact.
exxonmobil includes estimates of potential costs related to possible public
policies covering energy-related greenhouse gas emissions in its long-term outlook
for energy, which is used as a foundation for assessing the business
environment and in its investment evaluations.
the information provided in the long-term business outlook
includes exxonmobils internal estimates and forecasts based upon internal data
and analyses as well as publicly available information from external sources
including the international energy agency.
upstream
exxonmobil
continues to maintain a diverse portfolio of exploration and development
opportunities, which enables the corporation to be selective, maximizing
shareholder value and mitigating political and technical risks. exxonmobils
fundamental upstream business strategies guide our global exploration,
development, production, and gas and power marketing activities. these
strategies include capturing material and accretive opportunities to
continually high-grade the resource portfolio, exercising a disciplined
approach to investing and cost management, developing and applying high-impact
technologies, pursuing productivity and efficiency gains, growing profitable
oil and gas production, and capitalizing on growing natural gas and power
markets. these strategies are underpinned by a relentless focus on operational
excellence, commitment to innovative technologies, development of our
employees, and investment in the communities within which we operate.
as future development projects and drilling activities
bring new production online, the corporation expects a shift in the geographic
mix and in the type of opportunities from which volumes are produced. oil equivalent
production from north america is expected to increase over the next several
years based on current capital activity plans, contributing over a third of
total production. further, the proportion of our global production from resource
types utilizing specialized technologies such as arctic, deepwater, and
unconventional drilling and production systems, as well as lng, is also expected
to grow, becoming a slight majority of production in the next few years. we do
not anticipate that the expected change in the geographic mix of production
volumes, and in the types of opportunities from which volumes will be produced,
will have a material impact on the
managements discussion and analysis of
financial condition and results of operations
nature and the
extent of the risks disclosed in item 1a. risk factors, or result in a material
change in our level of unit operating expenses.
the corporations overall volume capacity outlook, based on
projects coming onstream as anticipated, is for production capacity to grow over
the next few years. however, actual volumes will vary from year to year due to
the timing of individual project start-ups and other capital activities,
operational outages, reservoir performance, performance of enhanced oil
recovery projects, regulatory changes, the impact of fiscal and commercial
terms, asset sales, weather events, price effects on production sharing
contracts and other factors described in item 1a. risk factors. enhanced oil
recovery projects extract hydrocarbons from reservoirs in excess of that which
may be produced through primary recovery, i.e., through pressure depletion or
natural aquifer support. they include the injection of water, gases or chemicals
into a reservoir to produce hydrocarbons otherwise unobtainable.
the markets for crude oil and natural gas have a history of
significant price volatility. after some years of relatively stable prices, the
end of 2014 saw crude prices drop to levels not seen since 2009. exxonmobil
believes prices over the long term will continue to be driven by market supply
and demand, with the demand side largely being a function of global economic
growth. to manage the risks associated with price, exxonmobil evaluates annual
plans and all investments across a wide range of price scenarios. the
corporations assessment is that its operations will continue to be successful
in a variety of market conditions. this is the outcome of disciplined
investment, cost management, and asset enhancement programs.
downstream
exxonmobils
downstream is a large, diversified business with refining, logistics, and
marketing complexes around the world. the corporation has a presence in mature
markets in north america and europe, as well as in the growing asia pacific
region. exxonmobils fundamental downstream business strategies position the
company to deliver long-term growth in shareholder value that is superior to
competition across a range of market conditions. these strategies include targeting
bestinclass operations in all aspects of the business, maximizing
value from advanced technologies, capitalizing on integration across exxonmobil
businesses, selectively investing for resilient, advantaged returns, operating
efficiently and effectively, and providing quality, valued products and
services to customers.
exxonmobil has an ownership interest in 30 refineries,
located in 17countries, with distillation capacity of 5.2million

barrels per day. exxonmobils fuels and lubes marketing businesses have significant
global reach, with multiple channels to market serving a diverse customer base.
our portfolio of world-renowned brands includes exxon, mobil, esso
and mobil1.
the downstream industry environment remains challenging. demand
weakness and overcapacity in the refining sector will continue to increase
competitive pressure. in the near term, we see variability in refining margins,
with some regions seeing weaker margins as new capacity additions outpace
global demand. in north america, lower raw material and energy cost driven by
increasing crude oil and natural gas production has strengthened refining
margins over the past few years.
refining margins are largely driven by differences in
commodity prices and are a function of the difference between what a refinery
pays for its raw materials (primarily crude oil) and the market prices for the
range of products produced (primarily gasoline, heating oil, diesel oil, jet
fuel and fuel oil). crude oil and many products are widely traded with
published prices, including those quoted on multiple exchanges around the world
(e.g., new york mercantile exchange and intercontinental exchange). prices for
these commodities are determined by the global marketplace and are influenced
by many factors, including global and regional supply/demand balances,
inventory levels, industry refinery operations, import/export balances,
currency fluctuations, seasonal demand, weather and political climate.
exxonmobils longterm outlook is that industry refining
margins will remain subject to intense competition as, in the near term, new
capacity additions outpace the growth in global demand. additionally, as
described in more detail in item 1a. risk factors, proposed carbon policy and
other climate-related regulations in many countries, as well as the continued
growth in biofuels mandates, could have negative impacts on the refining
business. exxonmobils integration across the value chain, from refining to
marketing, enhances overall value in both fuels and lubricants businesses.
in the retail fuels marketing business, competition has
caused inflation-adjusted margins to decline. in 2014, exxonmobil expanded its
branded retail site network in the u.s. and progressed the multiyear
transition of the direct served (i.e., dealer, companyoperated) retail
network in portions of europe to a more capitalefficient branded
distributor model. exxonmobil is increasing investment in its fuels brands and
developing multiple programs that will enhance the value of its consumer retail
offer. the companys lubricants business continues to grow, leveraging
world-class brands and integration with industryleading basestock
refining capability. exxonmobil remains a market leader in the highvalue
synthetic lubricants sector where competition is increasing.
the downstream portfolio is continually evaluated during all
parts of the business cycle, and numerous asset divestments have been made over
the past decade. when investing in the downstream, exxonmobil remains focused
on selective and resilient
managements discussion and analysis of
financial condition and results of operations
projects. these investments
capitalize on the corporations worldclass scale and integration, demonstrated
efficiency, advanced technology and respected brands, enabling exxonmobil to
take advantage of attractive emerging growth opportunities around the globe. in
2014, the company commissioned the clean fuels project at the joint saudi
aramco and exxonmobil samref refinery in yanbu, saudi arabia, to produce low
sulfur gasoline and ultralow sulfur diesel. construction started on a
new delayed coker unit at the refinery in antwerp, belgium, to upgrade
low-value bunker fuel into highvalue diesel products. the company also
completed an expansion of lube basestock capacity at the refinery in singapore,
and neared completion on a lube basestock expansion in baytown, texas. a
finished lubricant plant expansion in tianjin, china, was completed and
additional lubricant plant expansions in china, singapore, finland, and the
u.s. are underway to support demand growth for finished lubricants and greases
in key markets.
chemical
worldwide
petrochemical demand continued to improve in 2014, led by growing demand from
asia pacific manufacturers of industrial and consumer products. north america
continued to benefit from abundant supplies of natural gas and gas liquids,
providing both low-cost feedstock and energy savings. specialty product margins
declined reflecting significant new industry capacity.
exxonmobil sustained its competitive advantage through
continued operational excellence, investment and cost discipline, a balanced
portfolio of products, integration with refining and upstream operations, all
underpinned by proprietary technology.
in 2014, exxonmobil began construction of a major expansion
at our texas facilities, including a new world-scale ethane cracker and
polyethylene lines, to capitalize on low-cost feedstock and energy supplies in
north america and meet rapidly growing demand for premium polymers.
construction of new halobutyl rubber and hydrocarbon resin units also started
in singapore to further extend our specialty product capacity in asia. at the
joint venture facility in al-jubail, saudi arabia, construction continued on
the specialty elastomers project that is expected to start-up in 2015.

listed below are
descriptions of exxonmobils volumes reconciliation factors which are provided
to facilitate understanding of the terms.
entitlements - net interest are changes to exxonmobils share of
production volumes caused by non-operational changes to volume-determining
factors. these factors consist of net interest changes specified in production
sharing contracts (pscs) which typically occur when cumulative investment
returns or production volumes achieve defined thresholds, changes in equity
upon achieving pay-out in partner investment carry situations, equity
redeterminations as specified in venture agreements, or as a result of the
termination or expiry of a concession. once a net interest change has occurred,
it typically will not be reversed by subsequent events, such as lower crude oil
prices.
entitlements - price, spend and other are changes to exxonmobils share of
production volumes resulting from temporary changes to non-operational
volume-determining factors. these factors include changes in oil and gas prices
or spending levels from one period to another. according to the terms of
contractual arrangements or government royalty regimes, price or spending
variability can increase or decrease royalty burdens and/or volumes
attributable to exxonmobil. for example, at higher prices, fewer barrels are
required for exxonmobil to recover its costs. these effects generally vary from
period to period with field spending patterns or market prices for oil and
natural gas. such factors can also include other temporary changes in net
interest as dictated by specific provisions in production agreements.
quotas are changes in exxonmobils allowable production arising
from production constraints imposed by countries which are members of the
organization of the petroleum exporting countries (opec). volumes reported in
this category would have been readily producible in the absence of the quota.
divestments are reductions in exxonmobils production
arising from commercial arrangements to fully or partially reduce equity in a
field or asset in exchange for financial or other economic consideration.
growth and other factors comprise all other operational
and non-operational factors not covered by the above definitions that may
affect volumes attributable to exxonmobil. such factors include, but are not
limited to, production enhancements from project and work program activities,
acquisitions including additions from asset exchanges, downtime, market demand,
natural field decline, and any fiscal or commercial terms that do not affect
entitlements.

cash and cash equivalents were $4.7 billion at the end of 2014, $0.3 billion
lower than the prior year. the major sources of funds in 2014 were net income
including noncontrolling interests of $33.6 billion, the adjustment for the
noncash provision of $17.3 billion for depreciation and depletion, a net debt
increase of $7.0 billion and collection of advances of $3.3 billion. the major
uses of funds included spending for additions to property, plant and equipment
of $33.0 billion, the purchase of shares of exxonmobil stock of $13.2 billion,
dividends to shareholders of $11.6 billion and a change in working capital,
excluding cash and debt, of $4.9 billion. included in total cash and cash equivalents
at year-end 2014 was $42 million of restricted cash.
total cash and cash equivalents were $4.9 billion at the
end of 2013, $5.0 billion lower than the prior year. the major sources of funds
in 2013 were net income including noncontrolling interests of $33.4 billion,
the adjustment for the noncash provision of $17.2 billion for depreciation and
depletion, and a net debt increase of $11.6 billion. the major uses of funds
included spending for additions to property, plant and equipment of $33.7
billion, the purchase of exxonmobil stock of $16.0 billion, dividends to
shareholders of $10.9 billion and a change in working capital, excluding cash
and debt, of $4.7 billion. included in total cash and cash equivalents at
year-end 2013 was $0.3 billion of restricted cash. for additional details, see
the consolidated statement of cash flows.
the corporation has access to significant capacity of long-term
and short-term liquidity. internally generated funds are expected to cover the
majority of financial requirements, supplemented by long-term and short-term
debt. on december 31, 2014, the corporation had unused committed short-term
lines of credit of $6.3 billion and unused committed long-term lines of credit
of $0.5 billion. cash that may be temporarily available as surplus to the
corporations immediate needs is carefully managed through counterparty quality
and investment guidelines to ensure it is secure and readily available to meet
the corporations cash requirements and to optimize returns.
to support cash flows in future periods the corporation
will need to continually find and develop new fields, and continue to develop
and apply new technologies and recovery processes to existing fields, in order
to maintain or increase production. after a period of production at plateau
rates, it is the nature of oil and gas fields eventually to produce at
declining rates for the remainder of their economic life. averaged over all the
corporations existing oil and gas fields and without new projects, exxonmobils
production is expected to decline at an average of approximately 3 percent per
year over the next few years. decline rates can vary widely by individual field
due to a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the type of
reservoir, fluid properties, recovery mechanisms, work activity, and age of the
field. furthermore, the corporations net interest in production for individual
fields can vary with price and the impact of fiscal and commercial terms.
the corporation has long been successful at offsetting the
effects of natural field decline through disciplined investments in quality
opportunities and project execution. over the last decade, this has resulted in
net annual additions to proved reserves that have exceeded the amount produced.
projects are in progress or planned to increase production capacity. however,
these volume increases are subject to a variety of risks including project
start-up timing, operational outages, reservoir performance, the impact of
fiscal and commercial terms, crude oil and natural gas prices, weather events,
and regulatory changes. the corporations cash flows are also highly dependent
on crude oil and natural gas prices. please refer to item1a. risk factors
for a more complete discussion of risks.
the corporations financial strength enables it to make large,
long-term capital expenditures. capital and exploration expenditures in 2014
were $38.5 billion, reflecting the corporations continued active investment
program. the corporation anticipates an average investment profile of about $34
billion per year for the next few years. actual
spending could vary depending on the progress of individual projects and
property acquisitions. the corporation has a large and diverse portfolio of
managements discussion and analysis of
financial condition and results of operations
development projects and exploration opportunities, which
helps mitigate the overall political and technical risks of the corporations
upstream segment and associated cash flow. further, due to its financial
strength, debt capacity and diverse portfolio of opportunities, the risk
associated with failure or delay of any single project would not have a
significant impact on the corporations liquidity or ability to generate
sufficient cash flows for operations and its fixed commitments. the purchase
and sale of oil and gas properties have not had a significant impact on the
amount or timing of cash flows from operating activities.
cash flow from
operating activities
cash provided by operating activities
totaled $45.1 billion in 2014, $0.2 billion higher than 2013. the major source

was $17.3 billion, up $0.1 billion from the prior year. the adjustment for net
gains on asset sales was $3.2 billion compared to an adjustment of $1.8 billion
in 2013. changes in operational working capital, excluding cash and debt,
decreased cash in 2014 by $4.9 billion.

$2.46 per share and totaled $11.6 billion, a pay-out of 36 percent of net income.
during the first quarter of 2014, the corporation issued $5.5 billion of
long-term debt. total debt increased $6.4 billion to $29.1 billion at yearend.
exxonmobil share of equity increased $0.4 billion to $174.4
billion. the addition to equity for earnings was $32.5 billion. this was offset
by reductions for distributions to exxonmobil shareholders of $23.6 billion, composed
of $11.6 billion in dividends and $12.0 billion of share purchases of exxonmobil
stock to reduce shares outstanding. foreign exchange translation effects of
$5.1 billion for the stronger u.s. currency and a $3.1 billion change in the
funded status of the postretirement benefits reserves also reduced equity.
during 2014, exxon
mobil corporation purchased 136 million shares of its common stock for the
treasury at a gross cost of $13.2 billion. these purchases were to reduce the
number of shares outstanding and to offset shares issued in conjunction with
company benefit plans and programs. shares outstanding were reduced by 3.1
percent from 4,335 million to 4,201 million at the end of 2014. purchases were
made in both the open market and through negotiated transactions. purchases may
be increased, decreased or discontinued at any time without prior notice.

this
table excludes commodity purchase obligations (volumetric commitments but no
fixed or minimum price) which are resold shortly after purchase, either in an
active, highly liquid market or under long-term, unconditional sales contracts
with similar pricing terms. examples include long-term, noncancelable lng and
natural gas purchase commitments and commitments to purchase refinery products
at market prices. inclusion of such commitments would not be meaningful in
assessing liquidity and cash flow, because these purchases will be offset in
the same periods by cash received from the related sales transactions. the
table also excludes unrecognized tax benefits totaling $9.0 billion as of
december31, 2014, because the corporation is unable to make reasonably
reliable estimates of the timing of cash settlements with the respective taxing
authorities. further details on the unrecognized tax benefits can be found in
note 19, income, sales-based and other taxes.
notes:
(1) includes capitalized lease
obligations of $375 million.
(2) the amount due in one year is
included in notes and loans payable of $17,468 million.
(3) the fair value of asset retirement
obligations, primarily upstream asset removal costs at the completion of field
life.
(4) the amount by which the benefit
obligations exceeded the fair value of fund assets for certain u.s. and
non-u.s. pension and other postretirement plans at year end. the payments by
period include expected contributions to funded pension plans in 2015 and
estimated benefit payments for unfunded plans in all years.
(5) minimum commitments for operating
leases, shown on an undiscounted basis, cover drilling equipment, tankers,
service stations and other properties.
(6) unconditional purchase obligations
(upos) are those long-term commitments that are noncancelable or cancelable
only under certain conditions, and that third parties have used to secure
financing for the facilities that will provide the contracted goods or
services. the undiscounted obligations of $1,095 million mainly pertain to
pipeline throughput agreements and include $433 million of obligations to
equity companies.
(7) take-or-pay obligations are
noncancelable, long-term commitments for goods and services other than upos.
the undiscounted obligations of $27,709 million mainly pertain to pipeline,
manufacturing supply and terminal agreements.
(8) firm commitments related to capital
projects, shown on an undiscounted basis, totaled approximately $25.6 billion.
these commitments were primarily associated with upstream projects outside the
u.s., of which $13.9 billion was associated with projects in africa, canada, australia,
united arab emirates, malaysia and kazakhstan. the corporation expects to fund
the majority of these projects with internally generated funds, supplemented by long-term and
short-term debt.

guarantees
the
corporation and certain of its consolidated subsidiaries were contingently
liable at december31, 2014, for guarantees relating to notes, loans and
performance under contracts (note 16). where guarantees for environmental
remediation and other similar matters do not include a stated cap, the amounts
reflect managements estimate of the maximum potential exposure. these guarantees
are not reasonably likely to have a material effect on the corporations
financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses,
results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.

views the corporations financial strength, as evidenced by the above financial
ratios and other similar measures, to be a competitive advantage of strategic
importance. the corporations sound financial position gives it the opportunity
to access the worlds capital markets in the full range of market conditions,
and enables the corporation to take on large, long-term capital commitments in
the pursuit of maximizing shareholder value.
litigation and other contingencies
as
discussed in note 16, a variety of claims have been made against exxonmobil and
certain of its consolidated subsidiaries in a number of pending lawsuits. based
on a consideration of all relevant facts and circumstances, the corporation
does not believe the ultimate outcome of any currently pending lawsuit against
exxonmobil will have a material adverse effect upon the corporations
operations, financial condition, or financial statements taken as a whole.
there are no events or uncertainties beyond those already included in reported
financial information that would indicate a material change in future operating
results or financial condition. refer to note 16 for additional information on
legal proceedings and other contingencies.

of about $34 billion per year for the next few years. actual spending could
vary depending on the progress of individual projects and property
acquisitions.
upstream spending of $32.7 billion in 2014 was down 14
percent from 2013, reflecting the absence of $4.2 billion of property
acquisition costs in 2013. investments in 2014 included projects in the u.s.
gulf of mexico, u.s. onshore drilling, exploration in russia and continued
progress on world-class projects in canada and australia. the majority of
expenditures are on development projects, which typically take two to four
years from the time of recording proved undeveloped reserves to the start of
production. the percentage of proved developed reserves was 65 percent of total
proved reserves at year-end 2014, and has been over 60 percent for the last ten
years, indicating that proved reserves are consistently moved from undeveloped
to developed status.
capital investments in the downstream totaled $3.0 billion

throughout
exxonmobils businesses, new and ongoing measures aretaken to prevent and
minimize the impact of our operations on air,water and ground. these
include a significant investment in refining infrastructure and technology to
manufacture clean fuels, as well asprojects to monitor and reduce
nitrogen oxide, sulfur oxide and greenhouse gas emissions, and expenditures for
asset retirement obligations. using definitions and guidelines established by
the american petroleum institute, exxonmobils 2014 worldwide environmental
expenditures for all such preventative and remediation steps, including
exxonmobils share of equity company expenditures, were about
$6.2billion. thetotal cost for such activities is expected to
remain in this range in 2015 and 2016 (with capital expenditures approximately
40percent of the total).
environmental liabilities
the
corporation accrues environmental liabilities when it is probable that
obligations have been incurred and the amounts can be reasonably estimated.
this policy applies to assets or businesses currently owned or previously
disposed. exxonmobil has accrued liabilities for probable environmental
remediation obligations at various sites, including multiparty sites where the
u.s. environmental protection agency has identified exxonmobil as one of the
potentially responsible parties. the involvement of other financially
responsible companies at these multiparty sites could mitigate exxonmobils
actual joint and several liability exposure. at present, no individual site is
expected to have losses material to exxonmobils operations or financial
condition. consolidated company provisions made in 2014 for environmental
liabilities were $780million ($321million in 2013) and the balance
sheet reflects accumulated liabilities of $1,066million as of
december31, 2014, and $773million as of december31, 2013.

crude
oil, natural gas, petroleum product and chemical prices have fluctuated in
response to changing market forces. the impacts of these price fluctuations on
earnings from upstream, downstream and chemical operations have varied. in the
upstream, a $1perbarrel change in the weighted-average realized price
of oil would have approximately a $350 million annual after-tax effect on
upstream consolidated plus equity company earnings. similarly, a $0.10 per kcf
change in the worldwide average gas realization would have approximately a $175
million annual after-tax effect on upstream consolidated plus equity company
earnings. for any given period, the extent of actual benefit or detriment will
be dependent on the price movements of individual types of crude oil, taxes and
other government take impacts, price adjustment lags in long-term gas
contracts, and crude and gas production volumes. accordingly, changes in
benchmark prices for crude oil and natural gas only provide broad indicators of
changes in the earnings experienced in any particular period.
in the very competitive downstream and chemical
environments, earnings are primarily determined by margin capture rather than
absolute price levels of products sold. refining margins are a function of the
difference between what a refiner pays for its raw materials (primarily crude
oil) and the market prices for the range of products produced. these prices in
turn depend on global and regional supply/demand balances, inventory levels,
refinery operations, import/export balances and weather.
managements discussion and analysis of
financial condition and results of operations
the global energy markets can give rise to extended periods in
which market conditions are adverse to one or more of the corporations
businesses. such conditions, along with the capital-intensive nature of the
industry and very long lead times associated with many of our projects,
underscore the importance of maintaining a strong financial position.
management views the corporations financial strength as a competitive
advantage.
in general, segment results are not dependent on the
ability to sell and/or purchase products to/from other segments. instead, where
such sales take place, they are the result of efficiencies and competitive
advantages of integrated refinery/chemical complexes. additionally,
intersegment sales are at market-based prices. the products bought and sold
between segments can also be acquired in worldwide markets that have
substantial liquidity, capacity and transportation capabilities. about 35
percent of the corporations intersegment sales represent upstream production
sold to the downstream. other intersegment sales include those between
refineries and chemical plants related to raw materials, feedstocks and
finished products.
although price levels of crude oil and natural gas may rise
or fall significantly over the short to medium term due to political events,
opec actions and other factors, industry economics over the long term will
continue to be driven by market supply and demand. accordingly, the corporation
evaluates the viability of all of its investments over a broad range of future
prices. the corporations assessment is that its operations will continue to be
successful in a variety of market conditions. this is the outcome of
disciplined investment and asset management programs.
the corporation has an active asset management program in
which underperforming assets are either improved to acceptable levels or
considered for divestment. the asset management program includes a disciplined,
regular review to ensure that all assets are contributing to the corporations
strategic objectives. the result is an efficient capital base, and the
corporation has seldom had to write down the carrying value of assets, even
during periods of low commodity prices.
risk management
the
corporations size, strong capital structure, geographic diversity and the
complementary nature of the upstream, downstream and chemical businesses reduce
the corporations enterprise-wide risk from changes in interest rates, currency
rates and commodity prices. as a result, the corporation makes limited use of
derivative instruments to mitigate the impact of such changes. with respect to
derivatives activities, the corporation believes that there are no material
market or credit risks to the corporations financial position, results of
operations or liquidity as a result of the derivatives described in note 13.
the corporation does not engage in speculative derivative activities or
derivative trading activities nor does it use derivatives with leveraged
features. credit risk associated with the corporations derivative position is
mitigated by several factors, including the use of derivative clearing exchanges
and the quality of and financial limits placed on derivative counterparties.
the corporation maintains a system of controls that includes the authorization,
reporting and monitoring of derivative activity.
the corporation is exposed to changes in interest rates,
primarily on its short-term debt and the portion of long-term debt that carries
floating interest rates. the impact of a 100-basis-point change in interest
rates affecting the corporations debt would not be material to earnings, cash
flow or fair value. the corporation has access to significant capacity of
long-term and short-term liquidity. internally generated funds are expected to
cover the majority of financial requirements, supplemented by long-term and
short-term debt. some joint-venture partners are dependent on the credit
markets, and their funding ability may impact the development pace of
joint-venture projects.
the corporation conducts business in many foreign
currencies and is subject to exchange rate risk on cash flows related to sales,
expenses, financing and investment transactions. the impacts of fluctuations in
exchange rates on exxonmobils geographically and functionally diverse
operations are varied and often offsetting in amount. the corporation makes
limited use of currency exchange contracts to mitigate the impact of changes in
currency values, and exposures related to the corporations limited use of the
currency exchange contracts are not material.
inflation and other uncertainties
the general
rate of inflation in many major countries of operation has remained moderate
over the past few years, and the associated impact on non-energy costs has
generally been mitigated by cost reductions from efficiency and productivity
improvements. increased demand for certain services and materials has resulted
in higher operating and capital costs in recent years. the corporation works to
minimize costs in all commodity price environments through its economies of
scale in global procurement and its efficient project management practices.
managements discussion and analysis of
financial condition and results of operations
recently
issued accounting standards
in
may 2014, the financial accounting standards board issued a new standard, revenue
from contracts with customers. the standard establishes a single revenue
recognition model for all contracts with customers, eliminates industry
specific requirements, and expands disclosure requirements. the standard is
required to be adopted beginning january 1, 2017. exxonmobil is evaluating the
standard and its effect on the corporations financial statements.
critical accounting estimates
the
corporations accounting and financial reporting fairly reflect its
straightforward business model involving the extracting, refining and marketing
of hydrocarbons and hydrocarbon-based products. the preparation of financial
statements in conformity with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles
(gaap) requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the
reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and the
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. the corporations accounting
policies are summarized in note 1.
oil and gas reserves
evaluations
of oil and gas reserves are important to the effective management of upstream
assets. they are an integral part of investment decisions about oil and gas
properties such as whether development should proceed. oil and gas reserve
quantities are also used as the basis to calculate unit-of-production
depreciation rates and to evaluate impairment.
oil and gas reserves include both proved and unproved
reserves. proved oil and gas reserves are those quantities of oil and gas which,
by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with
reasonable certainty to be economically producible. unproved reserves are those
with less than reasonable certainty of recoverability and include probable
reserves. probable reserves are reserves that are more likely to be recovered
than not.
the estimation of proved reserves is an ongoing process
based on rigorous technical evaluations, commercial and market assessment, and
detailed analysis of well information such as flow rates and reservoir pressure
declines. the estimation of proved reserves is controlled by the corporation
through long-standing approval guidelines. reserve changes are made within a
well-established, disciplined process driven by senior level geoscience and
engineering professionals, assisted by the reserves technical oversight group
which has significant technical experience, culminating in reviews with and
approval by senior management. notably, the corporation does not use specific quantitative
reserve targets to determine compensation. key features of the reserve
estimation process are covered in disclosure of reserves in item2.
although the corporation is reasonably certain that proved
reserves will be produced, the timing and amount recovered can be affected by a
number of factors including completion of development projects, reservoir
performance, regulatory approvals and significant changes in long-term oil and
gas price levels.
proved reserves can be further subdivided into developed
and undeveloped reserves. the percentage of proved developed reserves was 65
percent of total proved reserves at year-end 2014 (including both consolidated
and equity company reserves), and has been over 60 percent for the last ten
years, indicating that proved reserves are consistently moved from undeveloped
to developed status.
revisions can include upward or downward changes in
previously estimated volumes of proved reserves for existing fields due to the
evaluation or re-evaluation of (1)already available geologic, reservoir
or production data, (2)new geologic, reservoir or production data or
(3)changes in prices and year-end costs that are used in the estimation
of reserves. revisions can also result from significant changes in development
strategy or production equipment/facility capacity.
impact
of oil and gas reserves on depreciation. the calculation of unit-of-production depreciation is a critical
accounting estimate that measures the depreciation of upstream assets. it is
the ratio of actual volumes produced to total proved reserves or proved
developed reserves (those proved reserves recoverable through existing wells
with existing equipment and operating methods), applied to the asset cost. the
volumes produced and asset cost are known and, while proved reserves have a
high probability of recoverability, they are based on estimates that are
subject to some variability. while the revisions the corporation has made in
the past are an indicator of variability, they have had a very small impact on
the unit-of-production rates because they have been small compared to the large
reserves base.
impact
of oil and gas reserves and prices on testing for impairment. proved oil and gas properties held and
used by the corporation are reviewed for impairment whenever events or
circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable. assets
are grouped at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows
that are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets.
the corporation estimates the future undiscounted cash
flows of the affected properties to judge the recoverability of carrying
amounts. impairment analyses are generally based on proved reserves. where
probable reserves exist, an appropriately risk-
managements discussion and analysis of
financial condition and results of operations
adjusted
amount of these reserves may be included in the impairment evaluation. an asset
group would be impaired if its undiscounted cash flows were less than the
assets carrying value. impairments are measured by the amount by which the
carrying value exceeds fair value.
significant unproved properties are assessed for impairment
individually, and valuation allowances against the capitalized costs are
recorded based on the estimated economic chance of success and the length of
time that the corporation expects to hold the properties. properties that are
not individually significant are aggregated by groups and amortized based on
development risk and average holding period.
the corporation performs asset valuation analyses on an
ongoing basis as a part of its asset management program. these analyses assist
the corporation in assessing whether the carrying amounts of any of its assets
may not be recoverable. in addition to estimating oil and gas reserve volumes
in conducting these analyses, it is also necessary to estimate future oil and
gas prices. potential trigger events for impairment evaluation include a
significant decrease in current and projected reserve volumes, an accumulation
of project costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected, and
current period operating losses combined with a history and forecast of operating
or cash flow losses.
in general, the corporation does not view temporarily low prices
or margins as a trigger event for conducting the impairment tests. the markets
for crude oil and natural gas have a history of significant price volatility.
although prices will occasionally drop significantly, industry prices over the
long term will continue to be driven by market supply and demand. on the supply
side, industry production from mature fields is declining, but this is being
offset by production from new discoveries and field developments. opec
production policies also have an impact on world oil supplies. the demand side
is largely a function of global economic growth. the relative growth/decline in
supply versus demand will determine industry prices over the long term, and
these cannot be accurately predicted.
accordingly, any impairment tests that the corporation
performs make use of the corporations price assumptions developed in the
annual planning and budgeting process for the crude oil and natural gas
markets, petroleum products and chemicals. these are the same price assumptions
that are used for capital investment decisions. volumes are based on field
production profiles, which are updated annually. cash flow estimates for impairment
testing exclude the effects of derivative instruments.
supplemental information regarding oil and gas results of
operations, capitalized costs and reserves is provided following the notes to
consolidated financial statements. future prices used for any impairment tests
will vary from the ones used in the supplemental oil and gas disclosure and
could be lower or higher for any given year.
asset retirement obligations
the
corporation incurs retirement obligations for certain assets. the fair values
of these obligations are recorded as liabilities on a discounted basis, which
is typically at the time the assets are installed. in the estimation of fair
value, the corporation uses assumptions and judgments regarding such factors as
the existence of a legal obligation for an asset retirement obligation;
technical assessments of the assets; estimated amounts and timing of
settlements; discount rates; and inflation rates. asset retirement obligations
are disclosed in note 9 to the financial statements.
suspended exploratory well costs
the
corporation continues capitalization of exploratory well costs when the well
has found a sufficient quantity of reserves to justify its completion as a
producing well and the corporation is making sufficient progress assessing the
reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project. exploratory
well costs not meeting these criteria are charged to expense. the facts and
circumstances that support continued capitalization of suspended wells at year-end
are disclosed in note 10 to the financial statements.
consolidations
the
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of those subsidiaries
that the corporation controls. they also include the corporations share of the
undivided interest in certain upstream assets, liabilities, revenues and
expenses. amounts representing the corporations interest in the underlying net
assets of other significant entities that it does not control, but over which
it exercises significant influence, are accounted for using the equity method
of accounting.
investments in companies that are partially owned by the
corporation are integral to the corporations operations. in some cases they
serve to balance worldwide risks, and in others they provide the only available
means of entry into a particular market or area of interest. the other parties
who also have an equity interest in these companies are either independent
third parties or host governments that share in the business results according
to their ownership. the corporation does not invest in these companies in order
to remove liabilities from its balance sheet. in fact, the corporation has long
been on record supporting an
managements discussion and analysis of
financial condition and results of operations
alternative accounting
method that would require each investor to consolidate its share of all assets
and liabilities in these partially-owned companies rather than only its interest
in net equity. this method of accounting for investments in partially-owned
companies is not permitted by u.s. gaap except where the investments are in the
direct ownership of a share of upstream assets and liabilities. however, for
purposes of calculating return on average capital employed, which is not
covered by u.s. gaap standards, the corporation includes its share of debt of
these partially-owned companies in the determination of average capital
employed.
pension benefits
the
corporation and its affiliates sponsor about 100 defined benefit (pension)
plans in over 40 countries. the pension and other postretirement benefits footnote
(note 17) provides details on pension obligations, fund assets and pension
expense.
some of these plans (primarily non-u.s.) provide pension
benefits that are paid directly by their sponsoring affiliates out of corporate
cash flow rather than a separate pension fund. book reserves are established
for these plans because tax conventions and regulatory practices do not
encourage advance funding. the portion of the pension cost attributable to employee
service is expensed as services are rendered. the portion attributable to the
increase in pension obligations due to the passage of time is expensed over the
term of the obligations, which ends when all benefits are paid. the primary
difference in pension expense for unfunded versus funded plans is that pension
expense for funded plans also includes a credit for the expected long-term
return on fund assets.
for funded plans, including those in the u.s., pension
obligations are financed in advance through segregated assets or insurance
arrangements. these plans are managed in compliance with the requirements of
governmental authorities and meet or exceed required funding levels as measured
by relevant actuarial and government standards at the mandated measurement
dates. in determining liabilities and required contributions, these standards
often require approaches and assumptions that differ from those used for
accounting purposes.
the corporation will continue to make contributions to
these funded plans as necessary. all defined-benefit pension obligations,
regardless of the funding status of the underlying plans, are fully supported
by the financial strength of the corporation or the respective sponsoring
affiliate.
pension accounting requires explicit assumptions regarding,
among others, the long-term expected earnings rate on fund assets, the discount
rate for the benefit obligations and the long-term rate for future salary
increases. pension assumptions are reviewed annually by outside actuaries and
senior management. these assumptions are adjusted as appropriate to reflect
changes in market rates and outlook. the long-term expected earnings rate on
u.s. pension plan assets in 2014 was 7.25 percent. the 10year and 20year
actual returns on u.s. pension plan assets were 7 percent and 10 percent,
respectively. the corporation establishes the long-term expected rate of return
by developing a forward-looking, long-term return assumption for each pension
fund asset class, taking into account factors such as the expected real return
for the specific asset class and inflation. a single, long-term rate of return
is then calculated as the weighted average of the target asset allocation
percentages and the long-term return assumption for each asset class. a
worldwide reduction of 0.5 percent in the long-term rate of return on assets
would increase annual pension expense by approximately $170 million before tax.
differences between actual returns on fund assets and the
long-term expected return are not recognized in pension expense in the year
that the difference occurs. such differences are deferred, along with other
actuarial gains and losses, and are amortized into pension expense over the
expected remaining service life of employees.
litigation contingencies
a
variety of claims have been made against the corporation and certain of its
consolidated subsidiaries in a number of pending lawsuits. management has
regular litigation reviews, including updates from corporate and outside
counsel, to assess the need for accounting recognition or disclosure of these
contingencies. the status of significant claims is summarized in note 16.
the corporation accrues an undiscounted liability for those
contingencies where the incurrence of a loss is probable, and the amount can be
reasonably estimated. these amounts are not reduced by amounts that may be
recovered under insurance or claims against third parties, but undiscounted
receivables from insurers or other third parties may be accrued separately. the
corporation revises such accruals in light of new information. for
contingencies where an unfavorable outcome is reasonably possible and which are
significant, the corporation discloses the nature of the contingency and, where
feasible, an estimate of the possible loss. for purposes of our litigation
contingency disclosures, significant includes material matters as well as
other items which management believes should be disclosed.
management judgment is required related to contingent
liabilities and the outcome of litigation because both are difficult to predict.
however, the corporation has been successful in defending litigation in the
past. payments have not had a material
managements discussion and analysis of
financial condition and results of operations
adverse effect
on operations or financial condition. in the corporations experience, large
claims often do not result in large awards. large awards are often reversed or
substantially reduced as a result of appeal or settlement.
tax contingencies
the
corporation is subject to income taxation in many jurisdictions around the
world. significant management judgment is required in the accounting for income
tax contingencies and tax disputes because the outcomes are often difficult to
predict.
the benefits of
uncertain tax positions that the corporation has taken or expects to take in
its income tax returns are recognized in the financial statements if management
concludes that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained
with the tax authorities. for a position that is likely to be sustained, the
benefit recognized in the financial statements is measured at the largest
amount that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized. a reserve is
established for the difference between a position taken or expected to be taken
in an income tax return and the amount recognized in the financial statements.
the corporations unrecognized tax benefits and a description of open tax years
are summarized in note 19.
foreign currency translation
the
method of translating the foreign currency financial statements ofthe
corporations international subsidiaries into u.s. dollars is prescribed by
gaap. under these principles, it is necessary to select the functional currency
of these subsidiaries. the functional currency is the currency of the primary
economic environment in which the subsidiary operates. management selects the
functional currency after evaluating this economic environment.
factors considered by management when determining the
functional currency for a subsidiary include the currency used for cash flows
related to individual assets and liabilities; the responsiveness of sales
prices to changes in exchange rates; the history of inflation in the country;
whether sales are into local markets or exported; the currency used to acquire
raw materials, labor, services and supplies; sources of financing; and
significance of intercompany transactions.
managements
report on internal control over financial reporting
management, including the
corporations chief executive officer, principal financial officer, and principal
accounting officer, is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate
internal control over the corporations financial reporting. management
conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of internal control over financial
reporting based on criteria established in internal control
integrated framework (2013) issued by the committee of sponsoring
organizations of the treadway commission. based on this evaluation, management
concluded that exxon mobil corporations internal control over financial
reporting was effective as of december31, 2014.
pricewaterhousecoopers llp, an independent registered

report of independent registered public accounting firm
to the shareholders of exxon
mobil corporation:
in our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance
sheets and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income,
changes in equity and cash flows present fairly, in all material respects, the
financial position of exxon mobil corporation and its subsidiaries at
december31, 2014 and 2013, and the results of their operations and their
cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended december31, 2014
in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united
states of america. also in our opinion, the corporation maintained, in all
material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of
december31, 2014, based on criteria established in internal control
integrated framework (2013) issued by the committee of sponsoring
organizations of the treadway commission (coso). the corporations management
is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective
internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the
effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the
accompanying managements report on internal control over financial reporting.
our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements and on
the corporations internal control over financial reporting based on our
integrated audits. we conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of
the public company accounting oversight board (united states). those standards
require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether
effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all
material respects. our audits of the financial statements included examining,
on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. our audit of internal control over financial reporting included
obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting,
assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating
the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed
risk. our audits also included performing such other procedures as we
considered necessary in the circumstances. we believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinions.
a companys internal control over financial reporting is a
process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external
purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. a
companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and
procedures that (i)pertain to the maintenance of records that, in
reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and
dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii)provide reasonable
assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made
only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the
company; and (iii)provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or
timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. also, projections
of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk

notes to consolidated financial statements
the accompanying consolidated financial
statements and the supporting and supplemental material are the responsibility
of the management of exxon mobil corporation.
the corporations principal business is energy, involving
the worldwide exploration, production, transportation and sale of crude oil and
natural gas (upstream) and the manufacture, transportation and sale of
petroleum products (downstream). the corporation is also a major worldwide
manufacturer and marketer of petrochemicals (chemical).
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with
u.s. generally accepted accounting principles (gaap) requires management to
make estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities,
revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities.
actual results could differ from these estimates. prior years data has been
reclassified in certain cases to conform to the 2014 presentation basis.
1. summary of accounting policies
principles of consolidation. the consolidated financial statements
include the accounts of subsidiaries the corporation controls. they also
include the corporations share of the undivided interest in certain upstream
assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses.
amounts representing the corporations interest in entities
that it does not control, but over which it exercises significant influence,
are included in investments, advances and long-term receivables. the
corporations share of the net income of these companies is included in the
consolidated statement of income caption income from equity affiliates.
majority ownership is normally the indicator of control
that is the basis on which subsidiaries are consolidated. however, certain
factors may indicate that a majority-owned investment is not controlled and
therefore should be accounted for using the equity method of accounting. these
factors occur where the minority shareholders are granted by law or by contract
substantive participating rights. these include the right to approve operating
policies, expense budgets, financing and investment plans, and management
compensation and succession plans.
the corporations share of the cumulative foreign exchange
translation adjustment for equity method investments is reported in accumulated
other comprehensive income.
evidence of loss in value that might indicate impairment of
investments in companies accounted for on the equity method is assessed to
determine if such evidence represents a loss in value of the corporations
investment that is other than temporary. examples of key indicators include a
history of operating losses, negative earnings and cash flow outlook,
significant downward revisions to oil and gas reserves, and the financial
condition and prospects for the investees business segment or geographic
region. if evidence of an other than temporary loss in fair value below
carrying amount is determined, an impairment is recognized. in the absence of
market prices for the investment, discounted cash flows are used to assess fair
value.
revenue recognition. the corporation generally sells crude oil, natural gas and
petroleum and chemical products under short-term agreements at prevailing
market prices. in some cases (e.g., natural gas), products may be sold under
long-term agreements, with periodic price adjustments. revenues are recognized
when the products are delivered, which occurs when the customer has taken title
and has assumed the risks and rewards of ownership, prices are fixed or
determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured.
revenues from the production of natural gas properties in
which the corporation has an interest with other producers are recognized on
the basis of the corporations net working interest. differences between actual
production and net working interest volumes are not significant.
purchases and sales of inventory with the same counterparty
that are entered into in contemplation of one another are combined and recorded
as exchanges measured at the book value of the item sold.
sales-based taxes. the corporation reports sales, excise and value-added taxes on
sales transactions on a gross basis in the consolidated statement of income
(included in both revenues and costs).
derivative instruments. the corporation makes limited use of derivative
instruments. the corporation does not engage in speculative derivative
activities or derivative trading activities, nor does it use derivatives with
leveraged features. when the corporation does enter into derivative
transactions, it is to offset exposures associated with interest rates, foreign
currency exchange rates and hydrocarbon prices that arise from existing assets,
liabilities and forecasted transactions.
the gains and losses resulting from changes in the fair
value of derivatives are recorded in income. in some cases, the corporation
designates derivatives as fair value hedges, in which case the gains and losses
are offset in income by the gains and losses arising from changes in the fair
value of the underlying hedged item.
fair value. fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or
paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market
participants. hierarchy levels 1, 2 and 3 are terms for the priority of inputs
to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. hierarchy level 1 inputs
are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
hierarchy
notes to consolidated financial statements
level2 inputs are inputs other than
quoted prices included within level1 that are directly or indirectly
observable for the asset or liability. hierarchy level3 inputs are inputs
that are not observable in the market.
inventories. crude oil, products and merchandise inventories are carried at the
lower of current market value or cost (generally determined under the last-in,
first-out method  lifo). inventory costs include expenditures and other
charges (including depreciation) directly and indirectly incurred in bringing
the inventory to its existing condition and location. selling expenses and
general and administrative expenses are reported as period costs and excluded
from inventory cost. inventories of materials and supplies are valued at cost
or less.
property, plant and equipment. depreciation, depletion and amortization,
based on cost less estimated salvage value of the asset, are primarily
determined under either the unit-of-production method or the straight-line
method, which is based on estimated asset service life taking obsolescence into
consideration. maintenance and repairs, including planned major maintenance,
are expensed as incurred. major renewals and improvements are capitalized and
the assets replaced are retired.
the corporation uses the successful efforts method to
account for its exploration and production activities. under this method, costs
are accumulated on a field-by-field basis. costs incurred to purchase, lease,
or otherwise acquire a property (whether unproved or proved) are capitalized
when incurred. exploratory well costs are carried as an asset when the well has
found a sufficient quantity of reserves to justify its completion as a
producing well and where the corporation is making sufficient progress
assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project.
exploratory well costs not meeting these criteria are charged to expense. other
exploratory expenditures, including geophysical costs and annual lease rentals,
are expensed as incurred. development costs including costs of productive wells
and development dry holes are capitalized.
acquisition costs of proved properties are amortized using
a unit-of-production method, computed on the basis of total proved oil and gas
reserves. capitalized exploratory drilling and development costs associated
with productive depletable extractive properties are amortized using
unit-of-production rates based on the amount of proved developed reserves of
oil, gas and other minerals that are estimated to be recoverable from existing
facilities using current operating methods. under the unit-of-production
method, oil and gas volumes are considered produced once they have been
measured through meters at custody transfer or sales transaction points at the
outlet valve on the lease or field storage tank.
production involves lifting the oil and gas to the surface
and gathering, treating, field processing and field storage of the oil and gas.
the production function normally terminates at the outlet valve on the lease or
field production storage tank. production costs are those incurred to operate
and maintain the corporations wells and related equipment and facilities and
are expensed as incurred. they become part of the cost of oil and gas produced.
these costs, sometimes referred to as lifting costs, include such items as
labor costs to operate the wells and related equipment; repair and maintenance
costs on the wells and equipment; materials, supplies and energy costs required
to operate the wells and related equipment; and administrative expenses related
to the production activity.
proved oil and gas properties held and used by the
corporation are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable. assets
are grouped at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows
that are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets.
the corporation estimates the future undiscounted cash
flows of the affected properties to judge the recoverability of carrying
amounts. cash flows used in impairment evaluations are developed using annually
updated corporate plan investment evaluation assumptions for crude oil and
natural gas commodity prices, refining and chemical margins and foreign
currency exchange rates. annual volumes are based on field production profiles,
which are also updated annually. prices for other petroleum and chemical products
are based on corporate plan assumptions developed annually by major region and
also for investment evaluation purposes. cash flow estimates for impairment
testing exclude derivative instruments.
impairment analyses are generally based on proved reserves.
where probable reserves exist, an appropriately risk-adjusted amount of these
reserves may be included in the impairment evaluation. an asset group would be
impaired if the undiscounted cash flows were less than its carrying value. impairments
are measured by the amount the carrying value exceeds fair value.
significant unproved properties are assessed for impairment
individually, and valuation allowances against the capitalized costs are
recorded based on the estimated economic chance of success and the length of
time that the corporation expects to hold the properties. properties that are
not individually significant are aggregated by groups and amortized based on
development risk and average holding period. the valuation allowances are
reviewed at least annually.
gains on sales of proved and unproved properties are only
recognized when there is neither uncertainty about the recovery of costs
applicable to any interest retained nor any substantial obligation for future
performance by the corporation.
losses on properties sold are recognized when incurred or
when the properties are held for sale and the fair value of the properties is
less than the carrying value.
notes to consolidated financial statements
interest costs incurred to finance
expenditures during the construction phase of multiyear projects are
capitalized as part of the historical cost of acquiring the constructed assets.
the project construction phase commences with the development of the detailed
engineering design and ends when the constructed assets are ready for their
intended use. capitalized interest costs are included in property, plant and
equipment and are depreciated over the service life of the related assets.
asset retirement obligations and environmental liabilities.
thecorporation
incurs retirement obligations for certain assets. the fair values of these
obligations are recorded as liabilities on a discounted basis, which is
typically at the time the assets are installed. the costs associated with these
liabilities are capitalized as part of the related assets and depreciated. over
time, the liabilities are accreted for the change in their present value.
liabilities for environmental costs are recorded when it is
probable that obligations have been incurred and the amounts can be reasonably
estimated. these liabilities are not reduced by possible recoveries from third
parties and projected cash expenditures are not discounted.
foreign currency translation. the corporation selects the functional
reporting currency for its international subsidiaries based on the currency of
the primary economic environment in which each subsidiary operates.
downstream and chemical operations primarily use the local
currency. however, the u.s. dollar is used in countries with a history of high
inflation (primarily in latin america) and singapore, which predominantly sells
into the u.s. dollar export market. upstream operations which are relatively
self-contained and integrated within a particular country, such as canada, the
united kingdom, norway and continental europe, use the local currency. some
upstream operations, primarily in asia and africa, use the u.s. dollar because
they predominantly sell crude and natural gas production into u.s.
dollar-denominated markets.
for all operations, gains or losses from remeasuring
foreign currency transactions into the functional currency are included in
income.
stock-based payments. the corporation awards stock-based compensation to
employees in the form of restricted stock and restricted stock units.
compensation expense is measured by the price of the stock at the date of grant
and is recognized in income over the requisite service period.
2. accounting changes
the
corporation did not adopt authoritative guidance in 2014 that had a material
impact on the corporations financial statements.
in may 2014, the financial accounting standards board issued a new
standard, revenue from contracts with customers. the standard
establishes a single revenue recognition model for all contracts with
customers, eliminates industry specific requirements, and expands disclosure
requirements. the standard is required to be adopted beginning january 1, 2017.
exxonmobil is evaluating the standard and its effect on the corporations
financial statements.
3. miscellaneous financial information
research
and development expenses totaled $971 million in 2014, $1,044 million in 2013
and $1,042 million in 2012.
net income included before-tax aggregate foreign exchange
transaction losses of $225 million, and gains of $155 million and $159 million in
2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
in 2014, 2013 and 2012, net income included gains of $187
million, $282 million and $328 million, respectively, attributable to the
combined effects of lifo inventory accumulations and drawdowns. the aggregate
replacement cost of inventories was estimated to exceed their lifo carrying
values by $10.6 billion and $21.2 billion at december31, 2014, and 2013,

5. cash flow information
the
consolidated statement of cash flows provides information about changes in cash
and cash equivalents. highly liquid investments with maturities of three months
or less when acquired are classified as cash equivalents.
for 2014, the net (gain) on asset sales on the
consolidated statement of cash flows includes before-tax gains from the sale of
hong kong power operations, additional proceeds related to the 2013 sale of a
partial interest in iraq, the sale of downstream affiliates in the caribbean
and the sale or exchange of upstream properties in the u.s., canada, and
malaysia. for 2013, the amount includes before-tax gains from the sale of a
partial interest in iraq, the sale of downstream affiliates in the caribbean
and the sale of service stations. for 2012, the amount includes before-tax
gains related to the japan restructuring, the sale of an upstream property in
angola, exchanges of upstream properties, the sale of u.s. service stations and
the sale of downstream affiliates in malaysia and switzerland. these gains are
reported in other income on the consolidated statement of income.
in 2014, exxonmobil completed asset exchanges, primarily
non-cash transactions, of approximately $1.2 billion. this amount is not
included in the sales of subsidiaries, investments, and property, plant and
equipment or the additions to property, plant and equipment lines on the
statement of cash flows.
in 2012, the corporations interest in a cost company was
redeemed. as part of the redemption, a variable note due in 2035 issued by
mobil services (bahamas) ltd. was assigned to a consolidated exxonmobil
affiliate. this note is no longer classified as third party long-term debt.
this assignment did not result in a reduction in long-term debt on the
statement of cash flows.
in 2012, exxonmobil completed asset exchanges, primarily
noncash transactions, of approximately $1 billion. this amount is not included
in the sales of subsidiaries, investments, and property, plant and equipment
or the additions to property, plant and equipment lines on the statement of
cash flows.

respectively.
notes to consolidated financial statements
7. equity company information
the
summarized financial information below includes amounts related to certain
less-than-majority-owned companies and majority-owned subsidiaries where
minority shareholders possess the right to participate in significant
management decisions (see note 1). these companies are primarily engaged in oil
and gas exploration and production, natural gas marketing, and refining
operations in north america; natural gas exploration, production and
distribution, and downstream operations in europe; and exploration, production,
liquefied natural gas (lng) operations, refining operations, petrochemical
manufacturing, and fuel sales in asia. also included are several refining,
petrochemical manufacturing, and marketing ventures.
thecorporations ownership in these ventures is in
the form of shares in corporate joint ventures as well as interests in
partnerships. differences between the companys carrying value of an equity
investment and its underlying equity in the net assets of the affiliate are
assigned to the extent practicable to specific assets and liabilities based on
the companys analysis of the factors giving rise to the difference. the
amortization of this difference, as appropriate, is included in income from
equity affiliates.
the shareof total equity company revenues from sales
to exxonmobil consolidated companies was 14 percent, 13 percent and 16 percent
in the years 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
in 2013 and 2014, the corporation and rosneft established
various entities to conduct exploration and research activities. periods of
disproportionate funding will result in the corporation recognizing, during the
early phases of the projects, an investment that is larger than its equity
share in these entities. these joint ventures are considered variable interest
entities. however, since the corporation is not the primary beneficiary of
these entities, the joint ventures are reported as equity companies. in 2014,
the european union and united states imposed sanctions relating to the russian
energy sector. in compliance with the sanctions and all general and specific
licenses, prohibited activities involving offshore russia in the black sea,
arctic regions, and onshore western siberia have been wound down. the
corporation's maximum exposure to loss from these joint ventures as of december
31, 2014, is $1.0 billion.

in the upstream segment, depreciation is
generally on a unit-of-production basis, so depreciable life will vary by
field. in the downstream segment, investments in refinery and lubes basestock
manufacturing facilities are generally depreciated on a straight-line basis
over a 25-year life and service station buildings and fixed improvements over a
20-year life. in the chemical segment, investments in process equipment are
generally depreciated on a straight-line basis over a 20-year life.
accumulated depreciation and depletion totaled $194,121
million at the end of 2014 and $190,867 million at the end of 2013. interest
capitalized in 2014, 2013 and 2012 was $344 million, $309 million and $506
million, respectively.
asset retirement obligations
the
corporation incurs retirement obligations for certain assets. the fair values
of these obligations are recorded as liabilities on a discounted basis, which
is typically at the time the assets are installed. in the estimation of fair
value, the corporation uses assumptions and judgments regarding such factors as
the existence of a legal obligation for an asset retirement obligation;
technical assessments of the assets; estimated amounts and timing of
settlements; discount rates; and inflation rates. asset retirement obligations
incurred in the current period were level 3 fair value measurements. the costs
associated with these liabilities are capitalized as part of the related assets
and depreciated as the reserves are produced. over time, the liabilities are
accreted for the change in their present value.
asset retirement obligations for downstream and chemical
facilities generally become firm at the time the facilities are permanently
shut down and dismantled. these obligations may include the costs of asset
disposal and additional soil remediation. however, these sites have
indeterminate lives based on plans for continued operations and as such, the
fair value of the conditional legal obligations cannot be measured, since it is
impossible to estimate the future settlement dates of such obligations.

10. accounting for suspended exploratory
well costs
the
corporation continues capitalization of exploratory well costs whenthe
well has found a sufficient quantity of reserves to justify its completion as a
producing well and the corporationis making sufficient progress assessing
the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project. the term
project as used in this report can refer to a variety of different activities
and does not necessarily have the same meaning as in any government payment
transparency reports.
the following two tables provide details of the changes in
the balance of suspended exploratory well costs as well as an aging summary of
those costs.

13. financial instruments and derivatives
financial instruments. the fair value of financial instruments
is determined by reference to observable market data and other valuation
techniques as appropriate. the only category of financial instruments where the
difference between fair value and recorded book value is notable is long-term
debt. the estimated fair value of total long-term debt, excluding capitalized
lease obligations, was $11.7 billion and $6.8 billion at december 31, 2014, and
2013, respectively, as compared to recorded book values of $11.3 billion and $6.5
billion at december 31, 2014, and 2013, respectively. the increase in the
estimated fair value and book value of long-term debt reflects the
corporations issuance of $5,500 million of long-term debt in the first quarter
of 2014.
the fair value of long-term debt by
hierarchy level at december 31, 2014, is: level 1 $11,036 million; level 2 $561
million; and level 3 $63 million.
derivative instruments. the corporations size, strong capital
structure, geographic diversity and the complementary nature of the upstream,
downstream and chemical businesses reduce the corporations enterprise-wide
risk from changes in interest rates, currency rates and commodity prices. as a
result, the corporation makes limited use of derivatives to mitigate the impact
of such changes. the corporation does not engage in speculative derivative
activities or derivative trading activities nor does it use derivatives with
leveraged features. when the corporation does enter into derivative
transactions, it is to offset exposures associated with interest rates, foreign
currency exchange rates and hydrocarbon prices that arise from existing assets,
liabilities and forecasted transactions.
the estimated fair value of derivative instruments
outstanding and recorded on the balance sheet was a net asset of $75 million at
year-end 2014 and a net asset of $1 million at year-end 2013. assets and
liabilities associated with derivatives are usually recorded either in other
current assets or accounts payable and accrued liabilities.
the corporations fair value measurement of its derivative
instruments use either level 1 or level 2 inputs.
the corporation recognized a before-tax gain or (loss)
related to derivative instruments of $110 million, $(7) million and $(23)million
during 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. income statement effects associated
with derivatives are usually recorded either in sales and other operating
revenue or crude oil and product purchases.
the corporation believes there are no material market or
credit risks to the corporations financial position, results of operations or
liquidity as a result of the derivative activities described above.
notes to consolidated financial statements
14. long-term debt
at december31,
2014, long-term debt consisted of $11,341 million due inu.s. dollars and $312
million representing the u.s. dollar equivalent at year-end exchange rates of
amounts payable in foreign currencies. these amounts exclude that portion of
long-term debt, totaling $770 million, which matures within one year and is
included in current liabilities. the increase in the book value of long-term
debt reflects the corporations issuance of $5,500 million of long-term debt in
the first quarter of 2014. the amounts of long-term debt maturing in each of
the four years after december31, 2015, in millions of dollars, are: 2016
$537; 2017$2,993; 2018$872; and 2019$2,353.
at december 31, 2014, the corporations unused long-term credit lines were $0.5
billion.

15. incentive program
the 2003 incentive program provides for grants of stock
options, stock appreciation rights (sars), restricted stock and other forms of
award. awards may be granted to eligible employees of the corporation and those
affiliates at least 50 percent owned. outstanding awards are subject to certain
forfeiture provisions contained in the program or award instrument. options and
sars may be granted at prices not less than 100 percent of market value on the
date of grant and have a maximum life of 10 years. the maximum number of shares
of stock that may be issued under the 2003 incentive program is 220 million.
awards that are forfeited, expire or are settled in cash, do not count against
this maximum limit. the 2003 incentive program does not have a specified term.
new awards may be made until the available shares are depleted, unless the
board terminates the plan early. at the end of 2014, remaining shares available
for award under the 2003 incentive program were 108 million.
restricted
stock and restricted stock units. awards totaling 9,775 thousand, 9,729 thousand, and 10,017 thousand
of restricted (nonvested) common stock and restricted (nonvested) common stock
units were granted in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. compensation expense
for these awards is based on the price of the stock at the date of grant and is
recognized in income over the requisite service period. shares for these awards
are issued to employees from treasury stock. the units that are settled in cash
are recorded as liabilities and their changes in fair value are recognized over
the vesting period. during the applicable restricted periods, the shares and
units may not be sold or transferred and are subject to forfeiture. the
majority of the awards have graded vesting periods, with 50 percent of the
shares and units in each award vesting after three years and the remaining 50
percent vesting after seven years. awards granted to a small number of senior
executives have vesting periods of five years for 50 percent of the award and
of 10 years or retirement, whichever occurs later, for the remaining 50 percent
of the award.
the corporation has purchased shares in the open market and
through negotiated transactions to offset shares issued in conjunction with
benefit plans and programs. purchases may be discontinued at any time without
prior notice.

16. litigation and other contingencies
litigation.
a variety of claims have
been made against exxonmobil and certain of its consolidated subsidiaries in a
number of pending lawsuits. management has regular litigation reviews,
including updates from corporate and outside counsel, to assess the need for
accounting recognition or disclosure of these contingencies. the corporation
accrues an undiscounted liability for those contingencies where the incurrence
of a loss is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. if a range of
amounts can be reasonably estimated and no amount within the range is a better
estimate than any other amount, then the minimum of the range is accrued. the
corporation does not record liabilities when the likelihood that the liability
has been incurred is probable but the amount cannot be reasonably estimated or
when the liability is believed to be only reasonably possible or remote. for
contingencies where an unfavorable outcome is reasonably possible and which are
significant, the corporation discloses the nature of the contingency and, where
feasible, an estimate of the possible loss. for purposes of our contingency
disclosures, significant includes material matters as well as other matters
which management believes should be disclosed. exxonmobil will continue to
defend itself vigorously in these matters. based on a consideration of all
relevant facts and circumstances, the corporation does not believe the ultimate
outcome of any currently pending lawsuit against exxonmobil will have a
material adverse effect upon the corporations operations, financial condition,
or financial statements taken as a whole.
other
contingencies. the corporation
and certain of its consolidated subsidiaries were contingently liable at
december31,2014, for guarantees relating to notes, loans and
performance under contracts. where guarantees for environmental remediation and
other similar matters do not include a stated cap, the amounts reflect
managements estimate of the maximum potential exposure.

additionally,
the corporation and its affiliates have numerous long-term sales and purchase
commitments in their various business activities, all of which are expected to
be fulfilled with no adverse consequences material to the corporations
operations or financial condition. unconditional purchase obligations as
defined by accounting standards are those long-term commitments that are

notes to consolidated financial statements
in accordance with a nationalization
decree issued by venezuelas president in february 2007, by may 1, 2007, a
subsidiary of the venezuelan national oil company (pdvsa) assumed the operatorship
of the cerro negro heavy oil project. this project had been operated and owned
by exxonmobil affiliates holding a 41.67 percent ownership interest in the
project. the decree also required conversion of the cerro negro project into a
mixed enterprise and an increase in pdvsas or one of its affiliates
ownership interest in the project, with the stipulation that if exxonmobil
refused to accept the terms for the formation of the mixed enterprise within a
specified period of time, the government would directly assume the activities
carried out by the joint venture. exxonmobil refused to accede to the terms
proffered by the government, and on june 27, 2007, the government expropriated
exxonmobils 41.67 percent interest in the cerro negro project.
on september 6,
2007, affiliates of exxonmobil filed a request for arbitration with the
international centre for settlement of investment disputes (icsid) invoking
icsid jurisdiction under venezuelas investment law and the
netherlands-venezuela bilateral investment treaty. the icsid tribunal issued a
decision on june 10, 2010, finding that it had jurisdiction to proceed on the
basis of the netherlands-venezuela bilateral investment treaty. on october 9,
2014, the icsid tribunal issued its final award finding in favor of the
exxonmobil affiliates and awarding $1.6 billion as of the date of
expropriation, june 27, 2007, and interest from that date at 3.25% compounded
annually until the date of payment in full. the tribunal also noted that one of
the cerro negro project agreements provides a mechanism to prevent double
recovery between the icsid award and all or part of an earlier award of $908
million to an exxonmobil affiliate, mobil cerro negro, ltd., against pdvsa and
a pdvsa affiliate, pdvsa cn, in an arbitration under the rules of the
international chamber of commerce (icc). following the favorable icsid decision in the fourth
quarter of 2014, exxonmobil recognized earnings of $269 million, net of the
remaining asset value, for the proceeds received from the earlier icc award.
judgment was
entered on the icsid award by the united states district court for the southern
district of new york on october 10, 2014. a motion to vacate that judgment on
procedural grounds was filed by the republic of venezuela on october 14, 2014,
which was denied by the court. thereafter, the republic of venezuela filed a
motion to modify the judgment by reducing the rate of interest to be paid on
the icsid award from the entry of the courts judgment, until the date of
payment.
on october 23,
2014, the republic of venezuela filed with icsid an application to revise the
icsid award such that it requires repayment of the value of the icc award to
pdvsa at the same time as payment is made to the exxonmobil affiliates for the
icsid award and that provision be made for interest on the amount to be repaid.
thereafter, pursuant to icsid arbitration rules, the icsid award was stayed
pending further action of the tribunal. on october27,2014,
exxonmobil filed a response with icsid that contests the application for
revision of that award on both factual and jurisdictional grounds. on february
2, 2015, the republic of venezuela filed an application to annul the icsid
award. the application alleges that, in issuing the icsid award, the tribunal
exceeded its powers, failed to state reasons on which the icsid award was
based, and departed from a fundamental rule of procedure. upon registration of
the application with icsid on february 9, 2015, a further stay of the icsid
award was entered.
the federal
court in new york has stayed its judgment until such time as the stays of the
icsid award entered following the government of venezuelas filing of its two
applications have been lifted. the net impact of these matters on the
corporations consolidated financial results cannot be reasonably estimated.
regardless, the corporation does not expect the resolution to have a material
effect upon the corporations operations or financial condition.
an affiliate of exxonmobil is one of the
contractors under a production sharing contract (psc) with the nigerian
national petroleum corporation (nnpc) covering the erha block located in the
offshore waters of nigeria. exxonmobil's affiliate is the operator of the block
and owns a 56.25 percent interest under the psc. the contractors are in dispute
with nnpc regarding nnpc's lifting of crude oil in excess of its entitlement
under the terms of the psc. in accordance with the terms of the psc, the
contractors initiated arbitration in abuja, nigeria, under the nigerian
arbitration and conciliation act. on october24, 2011, a three-member
arbitral tribunal issued an award upholding the contractors' position in all
material respects and awarding damages to the contractors jointly in an amount
of approximately $1.8 billion plus $234 million in accrued interest. the contractors
petitioned a nigerian federal court for enforcement of the award, and nnpc
petitioned the same court to have the award set aside. on may 22, 2012, the
court set aside the award. the contractors have appealed that judgment. in june
2013, the contractors filed a lawsuit against nnpc in the nigerian federal high
court in order to preserve their ability to seek enforcement of the psc in the
courts if necessary. in october 2014, the contractors filed suit in the united
states district court for the southern district of new york to enforce, if
necessary, the arbitration award against nnpc assets residing within that
jurisdiction. at this time, the net impact of this matter on the corporation's
consolidated financial results cannot be reasonably estimated. however,
regardless of the outcome of enforcement proceedings, the corporation does not
expect the proceedings to have a material effect upon the corporation's
operations or financial condition.

payments for funded and unfunded plans.
(2) for 2014 and 2013, other postretirement benefits paid are
net of $21 million and $20 million of medicare subsidy receipts, respectively.
for selection of the discount rate for
u.s. plans, several sources of information are considered, including interest
rate market indicators and the discount rate determined by use of a yield curve
based on high-quality, noncallable bonds with cash flows that match estimated
outflows for benefit payments. for major non-u.s. plans, the discount rate is
determined by using bond portfolios with an average maturity approximating that
of the liabilities or spot yield curves, both of which areconstructed
using high-quality, local-currency-denominated bonds.
the measurement
of the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation assumes a health care cost
trend rate of 4.5 percent in 2016 and subsequent years. a one-percentage-point
increase in the health care cost trend rate would increase service and interest
cost by $91 million and the postretirement benefit obligation by $1,070
million. a one-percentage-point decrease in the health care cost trend rate
would decrease service and interest cost by $69 million and the postretirement
benefit obligation by $844 million.

the funding levels of all qualified
pension plans are in compliance withstandards set by applicable law or
regulation. as shown in the table below, certain smaller u.s. pension plans and
a number of non-u.s. pension plans are not funded because local tax conventions
andregulatory practices do not encourage funding of these plans. all
defined benefit pension obligations, regardless of the funding status
ofthe underlying plans, are fully supported by the financial strength
ofthe corporation or the respective sponsoring affiliate.

the long-term
expected rate of return on funded assets shown below is established for each
benefit plan by developing a forward-looking, long-term return assumption for
each asset class, taking into account factorssuch as the expected real
return for the specific asset class and inflation. a single, long-term rate of
return is then calculated as the weighted average of the target asset
allocation percentages and the long-term return assumption for each asset class.

the corporations investment strategy for
benefit plan assets reflects along-term view, a careful assessment of the
risks inherent in various asset classes and broad diversification to reduce the
risk of the portfolio. the benefit plan assets are primarily invested in
passive equity and fixedincome index funds to diversify risk while
minimizing costs. the equity funds hold exxonmobil stock only to the extent
necessary to replicate the relevant equity index. the fixed income funds are
largely invested in high-quality corporate and government debt securities.
studies are periodically conducted to establish the
preferred target asset allocation percentages. the target asset allocation for
the u.s. benefit plans and for the non-u.s. plans in aggregate is 40 percent
equity securities and 60 percent debt securities. the equity targets for the
u.s. and non-u.s. plans include an allocation to private equity partnerships
that primarily focus on early-stage venture capital of 5 percent and 3 percent,
respectively.
the fair value measurement levels are accounting terms that

18. disclosures about segments and related
information
the
upstream, downstream and chemical functions best define the operating segments
of the business that are reported separately. the factors used to identify
these reportable segments are based on the nature of the operations that are
undertaken by each segment. the upstream segment is organized and operates to
explore for and produce crude oil and natural gas. the downstream segment is
organized and operates to manufacture and sell petroleum products. the chemical
segment is organized and operates to manufacture and sell petrochemicals. these
segments are broadly understood across the petroleum and petrochemical
industries.
these functions have been defined as the operating segments
of the corporation because they are the segments (1)that engage in
business activities from which revenues are earned and expenses are incurred;
(2)whose operating results are regularly reviewed by the corporations
chief operating decision maker to make decisions about resources to be
allocated to the segment and to assess its performance; and (3)for which
discrete financial information is available.
earnings after income tax include transfers at estimated
market prices.
notes to consolidated financial statements
in corporate and financing activities,
interest revenue relates to interest earned on cash deposits and marketable
securities. interest expense includes non-debt-related interest expense of $129
million and $202 million in 2014 and 2012, respectively. for 2013,
non-debt-related interest expense was a net credit of $123 million, primarily
reflecting the effect of credits from the favorable resolution of prior year
tax positions.

unrecognized tax benefits. the corporation is subject to income
taxation in many jurisdictions around the world. unrecognized tax benefits
reflect the difference between positions taken or expected to be taken on
income tax returns and the amounts recognized in the financial statements. the

the gross unrecognized tax benefit
balances shown above are predominantly related to tax positions that would
reduce the corporations effective tax rate if the positions are favorably
resolved. unfavorable resolution of these tax positions generally would not
increase the effective tax rate. the 2014, 2013 and 2012 changes in
unrecognized tax benefits did not have a material effect on the corporations
net income.
resolution of these tax positions through negotiations with
the relevant tax authorities or through litigation will take many years to
complete. it is difficult to predict the timing of resolution for tax positions
since such timing is not entirely within the control of the corporation. it is
reasonably possible that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits could
increase by up to 30percent in the next 12 months, with no material
impact on the corporations net income.

years that remain subject to examination by major tax jurisdiction:

the corporation classifies interest on
income tax-related balances as interest expense or interest income and
classifies tax-related penalties as operating expense.
the corporation incurred $42 million in interest expense on
income tax reserves in 2014. for 2013, the corporations net interest expense
was a credit of $207 million, reflecting the effect of credits from the
favorable resolution of prior year tax positions. the corporation incurred $46
million in interest expense in 2012. the related interest payable balances were
$205 million and $156 million at december31, 2014, and 2013,
respectively.

the amounts shown for net capitalized costs of consolidated
subsidiaries are $12,856 million less at year-end 2014 and $13,667 million less
at year-end 2013 than the amounts reported as investments in property, plant
and equipment for the upstream in note9. this is due tothe exclusion
from capitalized costs of certain transportation and research assets and assets
relating to lng operations. assets related tooil sands and oil shale
mining operations are included in the capitalized costs in accordance with

the
amounts reported as costs incurred include both capitalized costs and costs
charged to expense during the year. costs incurred also include new asset
retirement obligations established in the current year, as well as increases or
decreases to the asset retirement obligation resulting from changes in cost
estimates or abandonment date. total consolidated costs incurred in 2014 were $29,115
million, down $4,508 million from 2013, due primarily to lower property
acquisition costs and development costs. in 2013 costs were $33,623 million, up
$2,477 million from 2012, due primarily to higher property acquisition costs
partially offset by lower exploration costs. total equity company costs
incurred in 2014 were $2,677 million, up $335 million from 2013, due primarily
to exploration costs.

oil and
gas reserves
the following information describes changes during the
years and balances of proved oil and gas reserves at year-end 2012, 2013, and
2014.
the definitions used are in accordance with the securities
and exchange commissions rule 4-10 (a)of regulation s-x.
proved oil and gas reserves are those quantities of oil and
gas, which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated
with reasonable certainty to be economically producible  from a given date
forward, from known reservoirs, and under existing economic conditions,
operating methods and government regulations  prior to the time at which
contracts providing the right to operate expire, unless evidence indicates that
renewal is reasonably certain. in some cases, substantial new investments in
additional wells and related facilities will be required to recover these
proved reserves.
in accordance with the securities and exchange commissions
rules, the year-end reserves volumes as well as the reserves change categories
shown in the following tables were calculated using average prices during the
12-month period prior to the ending date of the period covered by the report,
determined as an unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month
price for each month within such period. these reserves quantities are also
used in calculating unit-of-production depreciation rates and in calculating
the standardized measure of discounted net cash flow.
revisions can include upward or downward changes in
previously estimated volumes of proved reserves for existing fields due to the
evaluation or re-evaluation of (1)already available geologic, reservoir
or production data, (2)new geologic, reservoir or production data or
(3)changes in average prices and year-end costs that are used in the
estimation of reserves. this category can also include significant changes in
either development strategy or production equipment/facility capacity.
proved reserves include 100 percent of each majority-owned
affiliates participation in proved reserves and exxonmobils ownership
percentage of the proved reserves of equity companies, but exclude royalties
and quantities due others. gas reserves exclude the gaseous equivalent of
liquids expected to be removed from the gas on leases, at field facilities and
at gas processing plants. these liquids are included in net proved reserves of
crude oil and natural gas liquids.
in the proved reserves tables, consolidated reserves and
equity company reserves are reported separately. however, the corporation does
not view equity company reserves any differently than those from consolidated
companies.
reserves reported under production sharing and other
nonconcessionary agreements are based on the economic interest as defined by
the specific fiscal terms in the agreement. the production and reserves that we
report for these types of arrangements typically vary inversely with oil and
gas price changes. as oil and gas prices increase, the cash flow and value
received by the company increase; however, the production volumes and reserves
required to achieve this value will typically be lower because of the higher
prices. when prices decrease, the opposite effect generally occurs. the
percentage of total liquids and natural gas proved reserves (consolidated
subsidiaries plus equity companies) at year-end 2014 that were associated with
production sharing contract arrangements was 11 percent of liquids, 9 percent
of natural gas and 10 percent on an oil-equivalent basis (gas converted to
oil-equivalent at 6 billion cubic feet = 1million barrels).
net proved developed reserves are those volumes that are
expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and
operating methods or in which the cost of the required equipment is relatively
minor compared to the cost of a new well. net proved undeveloped reserves are
those volumes that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled
acreage, or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is
required for recompletion.
crude oil and natural gas liquids and natural gas
production quantities shown are the net volumes withdrawn from exxonmobils oil
and gas reserves. the natural gas quantities differ from the quantities of gas
delivered for sale by the producing function as reported in the operating
summary due to volumes consumed or flared and inventory changes.
the changes, between 2013 year-end proved reserves and 2014
year-end proved reserves, primarily reflect the revisions, extensions and
discoveries in canada and the united states.

standardized measure of discounted future cash flows
as required by the financial accounting
standards board, the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows
is computed by applying first-day-of-the-month average prices,
year-endcosts and legislated tax rates and a discount factor of 10 percent
tonet proved reserves. the standardized measure includes costs for
futuredismantlement, abandonment and rehabilitation obligations.
thecorporation believes the standardized measure does not provide
areliable estimate of the corporations expected future cash flows to be
obtained from the development and production of its oil and gas properties or
of the value of its proved oil and gas reserves. the standardized measure is
prepared on the basis of certain prescribed assumptions including
first-day-of-the-month average prices, which represent discrete points in time
and therefore may cause significant variability in cash flows from year to year
as prices change.
