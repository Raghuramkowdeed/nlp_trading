ITEM 1.       BUSINESS

EXXON MOBIL CORPORATION WAS INCORPORATED IN THE STATE OF

NEW JERSEY IN 1882. DIVISIONS AND AFFILIATED COMPANIES OF EXXONMOBIL OPERATE OR

MARKET PRODUCTS IN THE UNITED STATES AND MOST OTHER COUNTRIES OF THE WORLD.

THEIR PRINCIPAL BUSINESS IS ENERGY, INVOLVING EXPLORATION FOR, AND PRODUCTION

OF, CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS, MANUFACTURE OF PETROLEUM PRODUCTS AND

TRANSPORTATION AND SALE OF CRUDE OIL, NATURAL GAS AND PETROLEUM PRODUCTS.

EXXONMOBIL IS A MAJOR MANUFACTURER AND MARKETER OF COMMODITY PETROCHEMICALS, INCLUDING

OLEFINS, AROMATICS, POLYETHYLENE AND POLYPROPYLENE PLASTICS AND A WIDE VARIETY OF

SPECIALTY PRODUCTS. AFFILIATES OF EXXONMOBIL CONDUCT EXTENSIVE RESEARCH

PROGRAMS IN SUPPORT OF THESE BUSINESSES.

EXXON MOBIL CORPORATION HAS SEVERAL

DIVISIONS AND HUNDREDS OF AFFILIATES, MANY WITH NAMES THAT INCLUDE

EXXONMOBIL

,

EXXON

,

ESSO, MOBIL

OR

XTO

. FOR CONVENIENCE AND SIMPLICITY,

IN THIS REPORT THE TERMS

EXXONMOBIL, EXXON, ESSO, MOBIL

AND

XTO

,

AS WELL AS TERMS LIKE

CORPORATION

,

COMPANY

,

OUR

,

WE

AND

ITS

, ARE SOMETIMES USED AS ABBREVIATED REFERENCES TO SPECIFIC

AFFILIATES OR GROUPS OF AFFILIATES. THE PRECISE MEANING DEPENDS ON THE CONTEXT

IN QUESTION.

THROUGHOUT EXXONMOBIL’S BUSINESSES, NEW

AND ONGOING MEASURES ARE TAKEN TO PREVENT AND MINIMIZE THE IMPACT OF OUR

OPERATIONS ON AIR, WATER AND GROUND. THESE INCLUDE A SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT IN

REFINING INFRASTRUCTURE AND TECHNOLOGY TO MANUFACTURE CLEAN FUELS, AS WELL AS

PROJECTS TO MONITOR AND REDUCE NITROGEN OXIDE, SULFUR OXIDE AND GREENHOUSE GAS

EMISSIONS, AND EXPENDITURES FOR ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS. USING DEFINITIONS

AND GUIDELINES ESTABLISHED BY THE AMERICAN PETROLEUM INSTITUTE, EXXONMOBIL’S

2014 WORLDWIDE ENVIRONMENTAL EXPENDITURES FOR ALL SUCH PREVENTATIVE AND

REMEDIATION STEPS, INCLUDING EXXONMOBIL’S SHARE OF EQUITY COMPANY EXPENDITURES,

WERE $6.2 BILLION, OF WHICH $3.5 BILLION WERE INCLUDED IN EXPENSES

WITH THE REMAINDER IN CAPITAL EXPENDITURES. THE TOTAL COST FOR SUCH ACTIVITIES

IS EXPECTED TO REMAIN IN THIS RANGE IN 2015 AND 2016 (WITH CAPITAL EXPENDITURES

APPROXIMATELY 40 PERCENT OF THE TOTAL).

THE ENERGY AND PETROCHEMICAL INDUSTRIES

ARE HIGHLY COMPETITIVE. THERE IS COMPETITION WITHIN THE INDUSTRIES AND ALSO

WITH OTHER INDUSTRIES IN SUPPLYING THE ENERGY, FUEL AND CHEMICAL NEEDS OF BOTH

INDUSTRIAL AND INDIVIDUAL CONSUMERS. THE CORPORATION COMPETES WITH OTHER FIRMS

IN THE SALE OR PURCHASE OF NEEDED GOODS AND SERVICES IN MANY NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL

MARKETS AND EMPLOYS ALL METHODS OF COMPETITION WHICH ARE LAWFUL AND APPROPRIATE

FOR SUCH PURPOSES.

OPERATING DATA AND INDUSTRY SEGMENT

INFORMATION FOR THE CORPORATION ARE CONTAINED IN THE FINANCIAL SECTION OF THIS

REPORT UNDER THE FOLLOWING: “QUARTERLY INFORMATION”, “NOTE 18: DISCLOSURES

ABOUT SEGMENTS AND RELATED INFORMATION” AND “OPERATING SUMMARY”. INFORMATION ON

OIL AND GAS RESERVES IS CONTAINED IN THE “OIL AND GAS RESERVES” PART OF THE

“SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION ON OIL AND GAS EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION ACTIVITIES”

EXXONMOBIL HAS A LONG‐STANDING

COMMITMENT TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF PROPRIETARY TECHNOLOGY. WE HAVE A WIDE ARRAY

OF RESEARCH PROGRAMS DESIGNED TO MEET THE NEEDS IDENTIFIED IN EACH OF OUR

BUSINESS SEGMENTS. INFORMATION ON COMPANY-SPONSORED RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

SPENDING IS CONTAINED IN “NOTE 3: MISCELLANEOUS FINANCIAL INFORMATION” OF

THE FINANCIAL SECTION OF THIS REPORT. EXXONMOBIL HELD APPROXIMATELY 11 THOUSAND

ACTIVE PATENTS WORLDWIDE AT THE END OF 2014. FOR TECHNOLOGY LICENSED TO THIRD

PARTIES, REVENUES TOTALED APPROXIMATELY $148 MILLION IN 2014. ALTHOUGH

TECHNOLOGY IS AN IMPORTANT CONTRIBUTOR TO THE OVERALL OPERATIONS AND RESULTS OF

OUR COMPANY, THE PROFITABILITY OF EACH BUSINESS SEGMENT IS NOT DEPENDENT ON ANY

INDIVIDUAL PATENT, TRADE SECRET, TRADEMARK, LICENSE, FRANCHISE OR CONCESSION.

THE NUMBER OF REGULAR EMPLOYEES WAS 75.3 THOUSAND,

75.0 THOUSAND, AND 76.9 THOUSAND AT YEARS ENDED 2014, 2013 AND 2012,

RESPECTIVELY. REGULAR EMPLOYEES ARE DEFINED AS ACTIVE EXECUTIVE, MANAGEMENT,

PROFESSIONAL, TECHNICAL AND WAGE EMPLOYEES WHO WORK FULL TIME OR PART TIME FOR

THE CORPORATION AND ARE COVERED BY THE CORPORATION’S BENEFIT PLANS AND

PROGRAMS. REGULAR EMPLOYEES DO NOT INCLUDE EMPLOYEES OF THE COMPANY-OPERATED RETAIL

SITES (CORS). THE NUMBER OF CORS EMPLOYEES WAS 8.4 THOUSAND, 9.8 THOUSAND,

AND 11.1 THOUSAND AT YEARS ENDED 2014, 2013 AND 2012, RESPECTIVELY.

INFORMATION CONCERNING THE SOURCE AND

AVAILABILITY OF RAW MATERIALS USED IN THE CORPORATION’S BUSINESS, THE EXTENT OF

1

ITEM 1A.       RISK FACTORS

EXXONMOBIL’S FINANCIAL AND OPERATING

RESULTS ARE SUBJECT TO A VARIETY OF RISKS INHERENT IN THE GLOBAL OIL, GAS, AND

PETROCHEMICAL BUSINESSES. MANY OF THESE RISK FACTORS ARE NOT WITHIN THE

COMPANY’S CONTROL AND COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, OUR FINANCIAL AND

OPERATING RESULTS OR OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION. THESE RISK FACTORS INCLUDE.

SUPPLY AND DEMAND

THE OIL, GAS, AND PETROCHEMICAL BUSINESSES ARE

FUNDAMENTALLY COMMODITY BUSINESSES. THIS MEANS EXXONMOBIL’S OPERATIONS AND

EARNINGS MAY BE SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTED BY CHANGES IN OIL, GAS AND PETROCHEMICAL

PRICES AND BY CHANGES IN MARGINS ON REFINED PRODUCTS. OIL, GAS, PETROCHEMICAL

AND PRODUCT PRICES AND MARGINS IN TURN DEPEND ON LOCAL, REGIONAL AND GLOBAL

EVENTS OR CONDITIONS THAT AFFECT SUPPLY AND DEMAND FOR THE RELEVANT COMMODITY.

ECONOMIC CONDITIONS.

THE DEMAND FOR ENERGY AND PETROCHEMICALS CORRELATES CLOSELY WITH

GENERAL ECONOMIC GROWTH RATES. THE OCCURRENCE OF RECESSIONS OR OTHER PERIODS OF

LOW OR NEGATIVE ECONOMIC GROWTH WILL TYPICALLY HAVE A DIRECT ADVERSE IMPACT ON

OUR RESULTS. OTHER FACTORS THAT AFFECT GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS IN THE WORLD

OR IN A MAJOR REGION, SUCH AS CHANGES IN POPULATION GROWTH RATES, PERIODS OF

CIVIL UNREST, GOVERNMENT AUSTERITY PROGRAMS, OR CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE

FLUCTUATIONS, CAN ALSO IMPACT THE DEMAND FOR ENERGY AND PETROCHEMICALS.

SOVEREIGN DEBT DOWNGRADES, DEFAULTS, INABILITY TO ACCESS DEBT MARKETS DUE TO

CREDIT OR LEGAL CONSTRAINTS, LIQUIDITY CRISES, THE BREAKUP OR RESTRUCTURING OF

FISCAL, MONETARY, OR POLITICAL SYSTEMS SUCH AS THE EUROPEAN UNION, AND OTHER

EVENTS OR CONDITIONS THAT IMPAIR THE FUNCTIONING OF FINANCIAL MARKETS AND

INSTITUTIONS ALSO POSE RISKS TO EXXONMOBIL, INCLUDING RISKS TO THE SAFETY OF

OUR FINANCIAL ASSETS AND TO THE ABILITY OF OUR PARTNERS AND CUSTOMERS TO

FULFILL THEIR COMMITMENTS TO EXXONMOBIL.

OTHER DEMAND-RELATED FACTORS.

OTHER FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT THE DEMAND FOR OIL, GAS

AND PETROCHEMICALS, AND THEREFORE IMPACT OUR RESULTS, INCLUDE TECHNOLOGICAL

IMPROVEMENTS IN ENERGY EFFICIENCY; SEASONAL WEATHER PATTERNS, WHICH AFFECT THE

DEMAND FOR ENERGY ASSOCIATED WITH HEATING AND COOLING; INCREASED

COMPETITIVENESS OF ALTERNATIVE ENERGY SOURCES THAT HAVE SO FAR GENERALLY NOT

BEEN COMPETITIVE WITH OIL AND GAS WITHOUT THE BENEFIT OF GOVERNMENT SUBSIDIES

OR MANDATES; AND CHANGES IN TECHNOLOGY OR CONSUMER PREFERENCES THAT ALTER FUEL

CHOICES, SUCH AS TOWARD ALTERNATIVE FUELED VEHICLES.

OTHER SUPPLY-RELATED FACTORS.

COMMODITY PRICES AND MARGINS ALSO VARY DEPENDING ON A

NUMBER OF FACTORS AFFECTING SUPPLY. FOR EXAMPLE, INCREASED SUPPLY FROM THE

DEVELOPMENT OF NEW OIL AND GAS SUPPLY SOURCES AND TECHNOLOGIES TO ENHANCE

RECOVERY FROM EXISTING SOURCES TEND TO REDUCE COMMODITY PRICES TO THE EXTENT SUCH

SUPPLY INCREASES ARE NOT OFFSET BY COMMENSURATE GROWTH IN DEMAND. SIMILARLY,

INCREASES IN INDUSTRY REFINING OR PETROCHEMICAL MANUFACTURING CAPACITY TEND TO

REDUCE MARGINS ON THE AFFECTED PRODUCTS. WORLD OIL, GAS, AND PETROCHEMICAL

SUPPLY LEVELS CAN ALSO BE AFFECTED BY FACTORS THAT REDUCE AVAILABLE SUPPLIES,

SUCH AS ADHERENCE BY MEMBER COUNTRIES TO OPEC PRODUCTION QUOTAS AND THE

OCCURRENCE OF WARS, HOSTILE ACTIONS, NATURAL DISASTERS, DISRUPTIONS IN

COMPETITORS’ OPERATIONS, OR UNEXPECTED UNAVAILABILITY OF DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS

THAT MAY DISRUPT SUPPLIES. TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE CAN ALSO ALTER THE RELATIVE

COSTS FOR COMPETITORS TO FIND, PRODUCE, AND REFINE OIL AND GAS AND TO

MANUFACTURE PETROCHEMICALS.

OTHER MARKET FACTORS.

EXXONMOBIL’S BUSINESS RESULTS ARE ALSO EXPOSED TO

POTENTIAL NEGATIVE IMPACTS DUE TO CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES, INFLATION,

CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES, AND OTHER LOCAL OR REGIONAL MARKET CONDITIONS. WE

GENERALLY DO NOT USE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS TO HEDGE MARKET EXPOSURES.

GOVERNMENT AND POLITICAL FACTORS

EXXONMOBIL’S RESULTS CAN BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY

POLITICAL OR REGULATORY DEVELOPMENTS AFFECTING OUR OPERATIONS.

ACCESS LIMITATIONS.

A NUMBER OF COUNTRIES LIMIT ACCESS TO THEIR OIL AND GAS RESOURCES, OR

MAY PLACE RESOURCES OFF-LIMITS FROM DEVELOPMENT ALTOGETHER. RESTRICTIONS ON

FOREIGN INVESTMENT IN THE OIL AND GAS SECTOR TEND TO INCREASE IN TIMES OF HIGH

COMMODITY PRICES, WHEN NATIONAL GOVERNMENTS MAY HAVE LESS NEED OF OUTSIDE

SOURCES OF PRIVATE CAPITAL. MANY COUNTRIES ALSO RESTRICT THE IMPORT OR EXPORT

OF CERTAIN PRODUCTS BASED ON POINT OF ORIGIN.

RESTRICTIONS ON DOING BUSINESS.

EXXONMOBIL IS SUBJECT TO LAWS AND SANCTIONS IMPOSED

BY THE U.S. OR BY OTHER JURISDICTIONS WHERE WE DO BUSINESS THAT MAY PROHIBIT

EXXONMOBIL OR CERTAIN OF ITS AFFILIATES FROM DOING BUSINESS IN CERTAIN

COUNTRIES, OR RESTRICTING THE KIND OF BUSINESS THAT MAY BE CONDUCTED. SUCH

RESTRICTIONS MAY PROVIDE A COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE TO COMPETITORS WHO MAY NOT BE

SUBJECT TO COMPARABLE RESTRICTIONS.

LACK OF LEGAL CERTAINTY.

SOME COUNTRIES IN WHICH WE DO BUSINESS LACK

WELL-DEVELOPED LEGAL SYSTEMS, OR HAVE NOT YET ADOPTED CLEAR REGULATORY

FRAMEWORKS FOR OIL AND GAS DEVELOPMENT. LACK OF LEGAL CERTAINTY EXPOSES OUR

OPERATIONS TO INCREASED RISK OF ADVERSE OR UNPREDICTABLE ACTIONS BY GOVERNMENT

OFFICIALS, AND ALSO MAKES IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR US TO ENFORCE OUR CONTRACTS. IN

SOME CASES THESE RISKS CAN BE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AGREEMENTS TO ARBITRATE

DISPUTES IN AN INTERNATIONAL FORUM, BUT THE ADEQUACY OF THIS REMEDY MAY STILL

DEPEND ON THE LOCAL LEGAL SYSTEM TO ENFORCE AN AWARD.

2

REGULATORY AND LITIGATION RISKS.

EVEN IN COUNTRIES WITH WELL-DEVELOPED LEGAL

SYSTEMS WHERE EXXONMOBIL DOES BUSINESS, WE REMAIN EXPOSED TO CHANGES IN LAW

(INCLUDING CHANGES THAT RESULT FROM INTERNATIONAL TREATIES AND ACCORDS) THAT

COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS, SUCH AS.

·

INCREASES IN TAXES OR GOVERNMENT ROYALTY RATES

(INCLUDING RETROACTIVE CLAIMS);

·

PRICE CONTROLS;

·

CHANGES IN ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS OR OTHER LAWS

THAT INCREASE OUR COST OF COMPLIANCE OR REDUCE OR DELAY AVAILABLE BUSINESS

OPPORTUNITIES (INCLUDING CHANGES IN LAWS RELATED TO OFFSHORE DRILLING

OPERATIONS, WATER USE, OR HYDRAULIC FRACTURING);

·

ADOPTION OF REGULATIONS MANDATING THE USE OF

ALTERNATIVE FUELS OR UNCOMPETITIVE FUEL COMPONENTS;

·

ADOPTION OF GOVERNMENT PAYMENT TRANSPARENCY

REGULATIONS THAT COULD REQUIRE US TO DISCLOSE COMPETITIVELY SENSITIVE

COMMERCIAL INFORMATION, OR THAT COULD CAUSE US TO VIOLATE THE NON-DISCLOSURE

LAWS OF OTHER COUNTRIES; AND

·

GOVERNMENT ACTIONS TO CANCEL CONTRACTS,

RE-DENOMINATE THE OFFICIAL CURRENCY, RENOUNCE OR DEFAULT ON OBLIGATIONS,

RENEGOTIATE TERMS UNILATERALLY, OR EXPROPRIATE ASSETS.

LEGAL REMEDIES AVAILABLE TO COMPENSATE US FOR

EXPROPRIATION OR OTHER TAKINGS MAY BE INADEQUATE.

WE ALSO MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY THE OUTCOME OF

LITIGATION, ESPECIALLY IN COUNTRIES SUCH AS THE UNITED STATES IN WHICH VERY

LARGE AND UNPREDICTABLE PUNITIVE DAMAGE AWARDS MAY OCCUR, OR BY GOVERNMENT

ENFORCEMENT PROCEEDINGS ALLEGING NON-COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE LAWS OR

REGULATIONS.

SECURITY CONCERNS.

SUCCESSFUL OPERATION OF PARTICULAR FACILITIES OR PROJECTS MAY BE

DISRUPTED BY CIVIL UNREST, ACTS OF SABOTAGE OR TERRORISM, AND OTHER LOCAL

SECURITY CONCERNS. SUCH CONCERNS MAY REQUIRE US TO INCUR GREATER COSTS FOR

SECURITY OR TO SHUT DOWN OPERATIONS FOR A PERIOD OF TIME.

CLIMATE CHANGE AND GREENHOUSE GAS RESTRICTIONS.

DUE TO CONCERN OVER THE RISK OF CLIMATE CHANGE, A

NUMBER OF COUNTRIES HAVE ADOPTED, OR ARE CONSIDERING THE ADOPTION OF,

REGULATORY FRAMEWORKS TO REDUCE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS. THESE INCLUDE

ADOPTION OF CAP AND TRADE REGIMES, CARBON TAXES, RESTRICTIVE PERMITTING,

INCREASED EFFICIENCY STANDARDS, AND INCENTIVES OR MANDATES FOR RENEWABLE

ENERGY. THESE REQUIREMENTS COULD MAKE OUR PRODUCTS MORE EXPENSIVE, LENGTHEN

PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION TIMES, AND REDUCE DEMAND FOR HYDROCARBONS, AS WELL AS

SHIFT HYDROCARBON DEMAND TOWARD RELATIVELY LOWER-CARBON SOURCES SUCH AS NATURAL

GAS. CURRENT AND PENDING GREENHOUSE GAS REGULATIONS MAY ALSO INCREASE OUR

COMPLIANCE COSTS, SUCH AS FOR MONITORING OR SEQUESTERING EMISSIONS.

GOVERNMENT SPONSORSHIP OF ALTERNATIVE ENERGY.

MANY GOVERNMENTS ARE PROVIDING TAX ADVANTAGES AND

OTHER SUBSIDIES TO SUPPORT ALTERNATIVE ENERGY SOURCES OR ARE MANDATING THE USE

OF SPECIFIC FUELS OR TECHNOLOGIES. GOVERNMENTS ARE ALSO PROMOTING RESEARCH INTO

NEW TECHNOLOGIES TO REDUCE THE COST AND INCREASE THE SCALABILITY OF ALTERNATIVE

ENERGY SOURCES. WE ARE CONDUCTING OUR OWN RESEARCH EFFORTS INTO ALTERNATIVE

ENERGY, SUCH AS THROUGH SPONSORSHIP OF THE GLOBAL CLIMATE AND ENERGY PROJECT AT

STANFORD UNIVERSITY AND RESEARCH INTO LIQUID PRODUCTS FROM ALGAE AND BIOMASS

THAT CAN BE FURTHER CONVERTED TO TRANSPORTATION FUELS. OUR FUTURE RESULTS MAY

DEPEND IN PART ON THE SUCCESS OF OUR RESEARCH EFFORTS AND ON OUR ABILITY TO

ADAPT AND APPLY THE STRENGTHS OF OUR CURRENT BUSINESS MODEL TO PROVIDING THE ENERGY

PRODUCTS OF THE FUTURE IN A COST-COMPETITIVE MANNER. SEE “MANAGEMENT

EFFECTIVENESS” BELOW.

MANAGEMENT EFFECTIVENESS

IN ADDITION TO EXTERNAL ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL

FACTORS, OUR FUTURE BUSINESS RESULTS ALSO DEPEND ON OUR ABILITY TO MANAGE

SUCCESSFULLY THOSE FACTORS THAT ARE AT LEAST IN PART WITHIN OUR CONTROL. THE

EXTENT TO WHICH WE MANAGE THESE FACTORS WILL IMPACT OUR PERFORMANCE RELATIVE TO

COMPETITION. FOR PROJECTS IN WHICH WE ARE NOT THE OPERATOR, WE DEPEND ON THE

MANAGEMENT EFFECTIVENESS OF ONE OR MORE CO-VENTURERS WHOM WE DO NOT CONTROL.

EXPLORATION AND DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM.

OUR ABILITY TO MAINTAIN AND GROW OUR OIL AND GAS

PRODUCTION DEPENDS ON THE SUCCESS OF OUR EXPLORATION AND DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS.

AMONG OTHER FACTORS, WE MUST CONTINUOUSLY IMPROVE OUR ABILITY TO IDENTIFY THE

MOST PROMISING RESOURCE PROSPECTS AND APPLY OUR PROJECT MANAGEMENT EXPERTISE TO

BRING DISCOVERED RESOURCES ON LINE ON SCHEDULE AND WITHIN BUDGET.

PROJECT MANAGEMENT.

THE SUCCESS OF EXXONMOBIL’S UPSTREAM, DOWNSTREAM, AND CHEMICAL

BUSINESSES DEPENDS ON COMPLEX, LONG-TERM, CAPITAL INTENSIVE PROJECTS. THESE

PROJECTS IN TURN REQUIRE A HIGH DEGREE OF PROJECT MANAGEMENT EXPERTISE TO

MAXIMIZE EFFICIENCY. SPECIFIC FACTORS THAT CAN AFFECT THE PERFORMANCE OF MAJOR

PROJECTS INCLUDE OUR ABILITY TO: NEGOTIATE SUCCESSFULLY WITH JOINT VENTURERS,

PARTNERS, GOVERNMENTS, SUPPLIERS, CUSTOMERS, OR OTHERS; MODEL AND OPTIMIZE

RESERVOIR PERFORMANCE; DEVELOP MARKETS FOR PROJECT OUTPUTS, WHETHER THROUGH LONG-TERM

CONTRACTS OR THE DEVELOPMENT OF EFFECTIVE SPOT MARKETS; MANAGE CHANGES IN

OPERATING CONDITIONS AND COSTS, INCLUDING COSTS OF THIRD PARTY EQUIPMENT OR

SERVICES SUCH AS DRILLING RIGS AND SHIPPING; PREVENT, TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE,

AND RESPOND EFFECTIVELY TO UNFORESEEN TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES THAT COULD DELAY

PROJECT STARTUP OR CAUSE UNSCHEDULED PROJECT DOWNTIME; AND INFLUENCE THE

PERFORMANCE OF PROJECT OPERATORS WHERE EXXONMOBIL DOES NOT PERFORM THAT ROLE.

3

THE TERM “PROJECT” AS USED

IN THIS REPORT CAN REFER TO A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT ACTIVITIES AND DOES NOT

NECESSARILY HAVE THE SAME MEANING AS IN ANY GOVERNMENT PAYMENT TRANSPARENCY

REPORTS.

OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCY.

AN IMPORTANT COMPONENT OF EXXONMOBIL’S COMPETITIVE

PERFORMANCE, ESPECIALLY GIVEN THE COMMODITY-BASED NATURE OF MANY OF OUR

BUSINESSES, IS OUR ABILITY TO OPERATE EFFICIENTLY, INCLUDING OUR ABILITY TO

MANAGE EXPENSES AND IMPROVE PRODUCTION YIELDS ON AN ONGOING BASIS. THIS

REQUIRES CONTINUOUS MANAGEMENT FOCUS, INCLUDING TECHNOLOGY IMPROVEMENTS, COST

CONTROL, PRODUCTIVITY ENHANCEMENTS, REGULAR REAPPRAISAL OF OUR ASSET PORTFOLIO,

AND THE RECRUITMENT, DEVELOPMENT AND RETENTION OF HIGH CALIBER EMPLOYEES.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT.

TO MAINTAIN OUR COMPETITIVE POSITION, ESPECIALLY IN

LIGHT OF THE TECHNOLOGICAL NATURE OF OUR BUSINESSES AND THE NEED FOR CONTINUOUS

EFFICIENCY IMPROVEMENT, EXXONMOBIL’S RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ORGANIZATIONS

MUST BE SUCCESSFUL AND ABLE TO ADAPT TO A CHANGING MARKET AND POLICY

ENVIRONMENT.

SAFETY, BUSINESS CONTROLS, AND ENVIRONMENTAL RISK

MANAGEMENT.

OUR RESULTS DEPEND ON

MANAGEMENT’S ABILITY TO MINIMIZE THE INHERENT RISKS OF OIL, GAS, AND

PETROCHEMICAL OPERATIONS, TO CONTROL EFFECTIVELY OUR BUSINESS ACTIVITIES AND TO

MINIMIZE THE POTENTIAL FOR HUMAN ERROR. WE APPLY RIGOROUS MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS

AND CONTINUOUS FOCUS TO WORKPLACE SAFETY AND TO AVOIDING SPILLS OR OTHER

ADVERSE ENVIRONMENTAL EVENTS. FOR EXAMPLE, WE WORK TO MINIMIZE SPILLS THROUGH A

COMBINED PROGRAM OF EFFECTIVE OPERATIONS INTEGRITY MANAGEMENT, ONGOING

UPGRADES, KEY EQUIPMENT REPLACEMENTS, AND COMPREHENSIVE INSPECTION AND

SURVEILLANCE. SIMILARLY, WE ARE IMPLEMENTING COST-EFFECTIVE NEW TECHNOLOGIES

AND ADOPTING NEW OPERATING PRACTICES TO REDUCE AIR EMISSIONS, NOT ONLY IN

RESPONSE TO GOVERNMENT REQUIREMENTS BUT ALSO TO ADDRESS COMMUNITY PRIORITIES.

WE ALSO MAINTAIN A DISCIPLINED FRAMEWORK OF INTERNAL CONTROLS AND APPLY A

CONTROLS MANAGEMENT SYSTEM FOR MONITORING COMPLIANCE WITH THIS FRAMEWORK.

SUBSTANTIAL LIABILITIES AND OTHER ADVERSE IMPACTS COULD RESULT IF OUR MANAGEMENT

SYSTEMS AND CONTROLS DO NOT FUNCTION AS INTENDED. THE ABILITY TO INSURE AGAINST

SUCH RISKS IS LIMITED BY THE CAPACITY OF THE APPLICABLE INSURANCE MARKETS,

WHICH MAY NOT BE SUFFICIENT.

BUSINESS RISKS ALSO INCLUDE THE RISK OF CYBERSECURITY

BREACHES. IF OUR SYSTEMS FOR PROTECTING AGAINST CYBERSECURITY RISKS PROVE NOT

TO BE SUFFICIENT, EXXONMOBIL COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED SUCH AS BY HAVING ITS

BUSINESS SYSTEMS COMPROMISED, ITS PROPRIETARY INFORMATION ALTERED, LOST OR

STOLEN, OR ITS BUSINESS OPERATIONS DISRUPTED.

PREPAREDNESS.

OUR OPERATIONS MAY BE DISRUPTED BY SEVERE WEATHER EVENTS, NATURAL DISASTERS,

HUMAN ERROR, AND SIMILAR EVENTS. FOR EXAMPLE, HURRICANES MAY DAMAGE OUR

OFFSHORE PRODUCTION FACILITIES OR COASTAL REFINING AND PETROCHEMICAL PLANTS IN

VULNERABLE AREAS. OUR ABILITY TO MITIGATE THE ADVERSE IMPACTS OF THESE EVENTS

DEPENDS IN PART UPON THE EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR RIGOROUS DISASTER PREPAREDNESS

AND RESPONSE PLANNING, AS WELL AS BUSINESS CONTINUITY PLANNING.

PROJECTIONS, ESTIMATES AND DESCRIPTIONS OF

EXXONMOBIL’S PLANS AND OBJECTIVES INCLUDED OR INCORPORATED IN ITEMS 1, 1A, 2, 7

AND 7A OF THIS REPORT ARE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS. ACTUAL FUTURE RESULTS,

IN THE PRECEDING RESERVES INFORMATION, CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARY AND

EQUITY COMPANY RESERVES ARE REPORTED SEPARATELY. HOWEVER, THE CORPORATION

OPERATES ITS BUSINESS WITH THE SAME VIEW OF EQUITY COMPANY RESERVES AS IT HAS

FOR RESERVES FROM CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES.

THE CORPORATION’S OVERALL VOLUME CAPACITY

OUTLOOK, BASED ON PROJECTS COMING ON STREAM AS ANTICIPATED, IS FOR PRODUCTION

CAPACITY TO GROW OVER THE COMING YEARS. HOWEVER, ACTUAL VOLUMES WILL VARY FROM

YEAR TO YEAR DUE TO THE TIMING OF INDIVIDUAL PROJECT START-UPS, OPERATIONAL

OUTAGES, RESERVOIR PERFORMANCE, REGULATORY CHANGES, THE IMPACT OF FISCAL AND

COMMERCIAL TERMS, ASSET SALES, WEATHER EVENTS, PRICE EFFECTS ON PRODUCTION SHARING

CONTRACTS AND OTHER FACTORS AS DESCRIBED IN ITEM 1A—RISK FACTORS OF THIS

REPORT.

THE ESTIMATION OF PROVED RESERVES, WHICH

IS BASED ON THE REQUIREMENT OF REASONABLE CERTAINTY, IS AN ONGOING PROCESS

BASED ON RIGOROUS TECHNICAL EVALUATIONS, COMMERCIAL AND MARKET ASSESSMENTS AND

DETAILED ANALYSIS OF WELL AND RESERVOIR INFORMATION SUCH AS FLOW RATES AND

RESERVOIR PRESSURE DECLINES. FURTHERMORE, THE CORPORATION ONLY RECORDS PROVED

RESERVES FOR PROJECTS WHICH HAVE RECEIVED SIGNIFICANT FUNDING COMMITMENTS BY

MANAGEMENT MADE TOWARD THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE RESERVES. ALTHOUGH THE

CORPORATION IS REASONABLY CERTAIN THAT PROVED RESERVES WILL BE PRODUCED, THE

TIMING AND AMOUNT RECOVERED CAN BE AFFECTED BY A NUMBER OF FACTORS INCLUDING

COMPLETION OF DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS, RESERVOIR PERFORMANCE, REGULATORY APPROVALS

AND SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN PROJECTIONS OF LONG-TERM OIL AND GAS PRICE LEVELS.

B. TECHNOLOGIES USED IN

ESTABLISHING PROVED RESERVES ADDITIONS IN 2014

ADDITIONS TO EXXONMOBIL’S PROVED RESERVES IN 2014 WERE

BASED ON ESTIMATES GENERATED THROUGH THE INTEGRATION OF AVAILABLE AND APPROPRIATE

GEOLOGICAL, ENGINEERING AND PRODUCTION DATA, UTILIZING WELL-ESTABLISHED

TECHNOLOGIES THAT HAVE BEEN DEMONSTRATED IN THE FIELD TO YIELD REPEATABLE AND

CONSISTENT RESULTS.

DATA USED IN THESE INTEGRATED ASSESSMENTS

INCLUDED INFORMATION OBTAINED DIRECTLY FROM THE SUBSURFACE VIA WELLBORES, SUCH

AS WELL LOGS, RESERVOIR CORE SAMPLES, FLUID SAMPLES, STATIC AND DYNAMIC

PRESSURE INFORMATION, PRODUCTION TEST DATA, AND SURVEILLANCE AND PERFORMANCE

INFORMATION. THE DATA UTILIZED ALSO INCLUDED SUBSURFACE INFORMATION OBTAINED

THROUGH INDIRECT MEASUREMENTS INCLUDING HIGH-QUALITY 3-D AND 4-D SEISMIC DATA,

CALIBRATED WITH AVAILABLE WELL CONTROL INFORMATION. THE TOOLS USED TO INTERPRET

THE DATA INCLUDED PROPRIETARY SEISMIC PROCESSING SOFTWARE, PROPRIETARY

RESERVOIR MODELING AND SIMULATION SOFTWARE, AND COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE DATA

ANALYSIS PACKAGES.

IN SOME CIRCUMSTANCES, WHERE APPROPRIATE

ANALOG RESERVOIRS WERE AVAILABLE, RESERVOIR PARAMETERS FROM THESE ANALOGS WERE

USED TO INCREASE THE QUALITY OF AND CONFIDENCE IN THE RESERVES ESTIMATES.

C. QUALIFICATIONS OF

RESERVES TECHNICAL OVERSIGHT GROUP AND INTERNAL CONTROLS OVER PROVED RESERVES

EXXONMOBIL HAS A DEDICATED GLOBAL RESERVES GROUP THAT

PROVIDES TECHNICAL OVERSIGHT AND IS SEPARATE FROM THE OPERATING ORGANIZATION.

PRIMARY RESPONSIBILITIES OF THIS GROUP INCLUDE OVERSIGHT OF THE RESERVES

ESTIMATION PROCESS FOR COMPLIANCE WITH SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (SEC)

RULES AND REGULATIONS, REVIEW OF ANNUAL CHANGES IN RESERVES ESTIMATES, AND THE

REPORTING OF EXXONMOBIL’S PROVED RESERVES. THIS GROUP ALSO MAINTAINS THE

OFFICIAL COMPANY RESERVES ESTIMATES FOR EXXONMOBIL’S PROVED RESERVES OF CRUDE

AND NATURAL GAS LIQUIDS, BITUMEN, SYNTHETIC OIL AND NATURAL GAS. IN ADDITION,

THE GROUP PROVIDES TRAINING TO PERSONNEL INVOLVED IN THE RESERVES ESTIMATION

AND REPORTING PROCESS WITHIN EXXONMOBIL AND ITS AFFILIATES. THE MANAGER OF THE

GLOBAL RESERVES GROUP HAS MORE THAN 30 YEARS OF EXPERIENCE IN RESERVOIR

ENGINEERING AND RESERVES ASSESSMENT AND HAS A DEGREE IN ENGINEERING. HE IS AN

ACTIVE MEMBER OF THE SOCIETY OF PETROLEUM ENGINEERS (SPE) AND PREVIOUSLY SERVED

ON THE SPE OIL AND GAS RESERVES COMMITTEE. THE GROUP IS MANAGED BY AND STAFFED

WITH INDIVIDUALS THAT HAVE AN AVERAGE OF MORE THAN 20 YEARS OF TECHNICAL

EXPERIENCE IN THE PETROLEUM INDUSTRY, INCLUDING EXPERTISE IN THE CLASSIFICATION

AND CATEGORIZATION OF RESERVES UNDER THE SEC GUIDELINES. THIS GROUP INCLUDES

INDIVIDUALS WHO HOLD ADVANCED DEGREES IN EITHER ENGINEERING OR GEOLOGY. SEVERAL

MEMBERS OF THE GROUP HOLD PROFESSIONAL REGISTRATIONS IN THEIR FIELD OF EXPERTISE,

AND MEMBERS HAVE SERVED ON THE SPE OIL AND GAS RESERVES COMMITTEE.

THE GLOBAL RESERVES GROUP MAINTAINS A

CENTRAL DATABASE CONTAINING THE OFFICIAL COMPANY RESERVES ESTIMATES.

APPROPRIATE CONTROLS, INCLUDING LIMITATIONS ON DATABASE ACCESS AND UPDATE

CAPABILITIES, ARE IN PLACE TO ENSURE DATA INTEGRITY WITHIN THIS CENTRAL

DATABASE. AN ANNUAL REVIEW OF THE SYSTEM’S CONTROLS IS PERFORMED BY INTERNAL

AUDIT. KEY COMPONENTS OF THE RESERVES ESTIMATION PROCESS INCLUDE TECHNICAL

EVALUATIONS AND ANALYSIS OF WELL AND FIELD PERFORMANCE AND A RIGOROUS PEER

REVIEW. NO CHANGES MAY BE MADE TO THE RESERVES ESTIMATES IN THE CENTRAL

DATABASE, INCLUDING ADDITIONS OF ANY NEW INITIAL RESERVES ESTIMATES OR

SUBSEQUENT REVISIONS, UNLESS THESE CHANGES HAVE BEEN THOROUGHLY REVIEWED AND

EVALUATED BY DULY AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL WITHIN THE OPERATING ORGANIZATION. IN

ADDITION, CHANGES TO RESERVES ESTIMATES THAT EXCEED CERTAIN THRESHOLDS REQUIRE

FURTHER REVIEW AND APPROVAL OF THE APPROPRIATE LEVEL OF MANAGEMENT WITHIN THE

OPERATING ORGANIZATION BEFORE THE CHANGES MAY BE MADE IN THE CENTRAL DATABASE.

ENDORSEMENT BY THE GLOBAL RESERVES GROUP FOR ALL PROVED RESERVES CHANGES IS A

MANDATORY COMPONENT OF THIS REVIEW PROCESS. AFTER ALL CHANGES ARE MADE, REVIEWS

ARE HELD WITH SENIOR MANAGEMENT FOR FINAL ENDORSEMENT.

2. PROVED UNDEVELOPED RESERVES

AT YEAR-END 2014, APPROXIMATELY 8.8 BILLION OIL-EQUIVALENT

BARRELS (GOEB) OF EXXONMOBIL’S PROVED RESERVES WERE CLASSIFIED AS PROVED

UNDEVELOPED. THIS REPRESENTS 35 PERCENT OF THE 25.3 GOEB REPORTED IN PROVED

RESERVES. THIS COMPARES TO THE 8.5 GOEB OF PROVED UNDEVELOPED RESERVES REPORTED

AT THE END OF 2013. DURING THE YEAR, EXXONMOBIL CONDUCTED DEVELOPMENT

ACTIVITIES IN OVER 100 FIELDS THAT RESULTED IN THE TRANSFER OF APPROXIMATELY

0.8 GOEB FROM PROVED UNDEVELOPED TO PROVED DEVELOPED RESERVES BY YEAR-END. THE

LARGEST TRANSFERS WERE RELATED TO PAPUA NEW GUINEA (PNG) LNG START-UP AND

DRILLING ACTIVITY IN THE UNITED STATES.

ONE OF EXXONMOBIL’S REQUIREMENTS FOR

REPORTING PROVED RESERVES IS THAT MANAGEMENT HAS MADE SIGNIFICANT FUNDING

COMMITMENTS TOWARD THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE RESERVES. EXXONMOBIL HAS A

DISCIPLINED INVESTMENT STRATEGY AND MANY MAJOR FIELDS REQUIRE LONG LEAD-TIME IN

ORDER TO BE DEVELOPED. DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS TYPICALLY TAKE TWO TO FOUR YEARS

FROM THE TIME OF RECORDING  PROVED UNDEVELOPED RESERVES TO THE START OF

PRODUCTION. HOWEVER, THE DEVELOPMENT TIME FOR LARGE AND COMPLEX PROJECTS CAN

EXCEED FIVE YEARS. DURING 2014, DISCOVERIES AND EXTENSIONS RELATED TO NEW

PROJECTS ADDED APPROXIMATELY 0.6 GOEB OF PROVED UNDEVELOPED RESERVES. THE

LARGEST OF THESE ADDITIONS WERE RELATED TO PLANNED DRILLING IN THE UNITED

STATES AND PROJECT FUNDING IN ANGOLA, RUSSIA AND KAZAKHSTAN. OVERALL,

INVESTMENTS OF $24.2 BILLION WERE MADE BY THE CORPORATION DURING 2014 TO

PROGRESS THE DEVELOPMENT OF REPORTED PROVED UNDEVELOPED RESERVES, INCLUDING $22.4

BILLION FOR OIL AND GAS PRODUCING ACTIVITIES AND AN ADDITIONAL $1.8 BILLION FOR

OTHER NON-OIL AND GAS PRODUCING ACTIVITIES SUCH AS THE CONSTRUCTION OF SUPPORT

INFRASTRUCTURE AND OTHER RELATED FACILITIES. THESE INVESTMENTS REPRESENTED 74

PERCENT OF THE $32.7 BILLION IN TOTAL REPORTED UPSTREAM CAPITAL AND EXPLORATION

EXPENDITURES.

PROVED UNDEVELOPED RESERVES IN AUSTRALIA,

THE UNITED STATES, KAZAKHSTAN, NIGERIA, AND THE NETHERLANDS HAVE REMAINED

UNDEVELOPED FOR FIVE YEARS OR MORE PRIMARILY DUE TO CONSTRAINTS ON THE CAPACITY

OF INFRASTRUCTURE, THE PACE OF CO-VENTURER/GOVERNMENT FUNDING, AS WELL AS THE TIME

REQUIRED TO COMPLETE DEVELOPMENT FOR VERY LARGE PROJECTS. THE CORPORATION IS

REASONABLY CERTAIN THAT THESE PROVED RESERVES WILL BE PRODUCED; HOWEVER, THE

TIMING AND AMOUNT RECOVERED CAN BE AFFECTED BY A NUMBER OF FACTORS INCLUDING

COMPLETION OF DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS, RESERVOIR PERFORMANCE, REGULATORY

APPROVALS, AND SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN LONG-TERM OIL AND GAS PRICE LEVELS. OF

THE PROVED UNDEVELOPED RESERVES THAT HAVE BEEN REPORTED FOR FIVE OR MORE YEARS,

84 PERCENT ARE CONTAINED IN THE AFOREMENTIONED COUNTRIES. THE LARGEST OF THESE

IS RELATED TO LNG/GAS PROJECTS IN AUSTRALIA, WHERE CONSTRUCTION OF THE GORGON

LNG PROJECT IS UNDER WAY. IN KAZAKHSTAN, THE PROVED UNDEVELOPED RESERVES ARE

RELATED TO THE REMAINDER OF THE INITIAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE OFFSHORE KASHAGAN

FIELD WHICH IS INCLUDED IN THE NORTH CASPIAN PRODUCTION SHARING AGREEMENT AND

THE TENGIZCHEVROIL JOINT VENTURE WHICH INCLUDES A PRODUCTION LICENSE IN THE

TENGIZ – KOROLEV FIELD COMPLEX. THE TENGIZCHEVROIL JOINT VENTURE IS PRODUCING,

AND PROVED UNDEVELOPED RESERVES WILL CONTINUE TO MOVE TO PROVED DEVELOPED AS

APPROVED DEVELOPMENT PHASES PROGRESS. IN THE NETHERLANDS, THE GRONINGEN GAS

FIELD HAS PROVED UNDEVELOPED RESERVES REPORTED THAT ARE RELATED TO INSTALLATION

OF FUTURE STAGES OF COMPRESSION. THESE RESERVES WILL MOVE TO PROVED DEVELOPED

WHEN THE ADDITIONAL STAGES OF COMPRESSION ARE INSTALLED TO MAINTAIN FIELD

DELIVERY PRESSURE.

40 MILES NORTH OF FORT MCMURRAY, ALBERTA, CANADA. BITUMEN IS EXTRACTED FROM OIL

SANDS PRODUCED FROM OPEN-PIT MINING OPERATIONS, AND PROCESSED THROUGH A BITUMEN

EXTRACTION AND FROTH TREATMENT TRAIN. THE PRODUCT, A BLEND OF BITUMEN AND

DILUENT, IS SHIPPED TO OUR REFINERIES AND TO OTHER THIRD PARTIES. DILUENT IS

NATURAL GAS CONDENSATE OR OTHER LIGHT HYDROCARBONS ADDED TO THE CRUDE BITUMEN

TO FACILITATE TRANSPORTATION BY PIPELINE. DURING 2014, AVERAGE NET PRODUCTION

AT KEARL WAS 66 THOUSAND BARRELS PER DAY. THE KEARL EXPANSION PROJECT WAS

EXXONMOBIL’S INVESTMENT IN DEVELOPED AND UNDEVELOPED

ACREAGE IS COMPRISED OF NUMEROUS CONCESSIONS, BLOCKS AND LEASES. THE TERMS AND

CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH THE CORPORATION MAINTAINS EXPLORATION AND/OR PRODUCTION

RIGHTS TO THE ACREAGE ARE PROPERTY-SPECIFIC, CONTRACTUALLY DEFINED AND VARY

SIGNIFICANTLY FROM PROPERTY TO PROPERTY. WORK PROGRAMS ARE DESIGNED TO ENSURE

THAT THE EXPLORATION POTENTIAL OF ANY PROPERTY IS FULLY EVALUATED BEFORE

EXPIRATION. IN SOME INSTANCES, THE CORPORATION MAY ELECT TO RELINQUISH ACREAGE

IN ADVANCE OF THE CONTRACTUAL EXPIRATION DATE IF THE EVALUATION PROCESS IS

COMPLETE AND THERE IS NOT A BUSINESS BASIS FOR EXTENSION. IN CASES WHERE

ADDITIONAL TIME MAY BE REQUIRED TO FULLY EVALUATE ACREAGE, THE CORPORATION HAS

GENERALLY BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN OBTAINING EXTENSIONS. THE SCHEDULED EXPIRATION OF

LEASES AND CONCESSIONS FOR UNDEVELOPED ACREAGE OVER THE NEXT THREE YEARS IS NOT

EXPECTED TO HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON THE CORPORATION.

18

D. SUMMARY OF ACREAGE TERMS

UNITED STATES

OIL AND GAS LEASES HAVE AN EXPLORATION PERIOD RANGING FROM

ONE TO TEN YEARS, AND A PRODUCTION PERIOD THAT NORMALLY REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL

PRODUCTION CEASES. UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES, A LEASE MAY BE HELD BEYOND ITS

EXPLORATION TERM EVEN IF PRODUCTION HAS NOT COMMENCED. IN SOME INSTANCES, A

“FEE INTEREST” IS ACQUIRED WHERE BOTH THE SURFACE AND THE UNDERLYING MINERAL

INTERESTS ARE OWNED OUTRIGHT.

CANADA / SOUTH

AMERICA

CANADA

EXPLORATION LICENSES OR LEASES IN ONSHORE AREAS ARE

ACQUIRED FOR VARYING PERIODS OF TIME WITH RENEWALS OR EXTENSIONS POSSIBLE.

THESE LICENSES OR LEASES ENTITLE THE HOLDER TO CONTINUE EXISTING LICENSES OR

LEASES UPON COMPLETING SPECIFIED WORK. IN GENERAL, THESE LICENSE AND LEASE AGREEMENTS

ARE HELD AS LONG AS THERE IS PRODUCTION ON THE LICENSES AND LEASES. EXPLORATION

LICENSES IN OFFSHORE EASTERN CANADA AND THE BEAUFORT SEA ARE HELD BY WORK

COMMITMENTS OF VARIOUS AMOUNTS AND RENTALS. THEY ARE VALID FOR A MAXIMUM TERM

OF NINE YEARS. PRODUCTION LICENSES IN THE OFFSHORE ARE VALID FOR 25 YEARS, WITH

RIGHTS OF EXTENSION FOR CONTINUED PRODUCTION. SIGNIFICANT DISCOVERY LICENSES IN

THE OFFSHORE, RELATING TO CURRENTLY UNDEVELOPED DISCOVERIES, DO NOT HAVE A

DEFINITE TERM.

ARGENTINA

THE FEDERAL HYDROCARBON LAW WAS AMENDED IN DECEMBER 2014.

THE ONSHORE CONCESSION TERMS GRANTED PRIOR TO THE AMENDMENT ARE UP TO SIX

YEARS, DIVIDED INTO THREE POTENTIAL EXPLORATION PERIODS, WITH AN OPTIONAL

EXTENSION FOR UP TO ONE YEAR DEPENDING ON THE CLASSIFICATION OF THE AREA.

PURSUANT TO THE AMENDED LAW, THE PRODUCTION TERM FOR A CONVENTIONAL PRODUCTION

CONCESSION WOULD BE 25 YEARS, AND 35 YEARS FOR AN UNCONVENTIONAL CONCESSION,

WITH UNLIMITED TEN-YEAR EXTENSIONS POSSIBLE, ONCE A FIELD HAS BEEN DEVELOPED.

EUROPE

GERMANY

EXPLORATION CONCESSIONS ARE GRANTED FOR AN INITIAL MAXIMUM

PERIOD OF FIVE YEARS, WITH AN UNLIMITED NUMBER OF EXTENSIONS OF UP TO THREE

YEARS EACH. EXTENSIONS ARE SUBJECT TO SPECIFIC, MINIMUM WORK COMMITMENTS.

PRODUCTION LICENSES ARE NORMALLY GRANTED FOR 20 TO 25 YEARS WITH MULTIPLE

POSSIBLE EXTENSIONS AS LONG AS THERE IS PRODUCTION ON THE LICENSE.

NETHERLANDS

UNDER THE MINING LAW, EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2003,

EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION LICENSES FOR BOTH ONSHORE AND OFFSHORE AREAS ARE

ISSUED FOR A PERIOD AS EXPLICITLY DEFINED IN THE LICENSE. THE TERM IS BASED ON

THE PERIOD OF TIME NECESSARY TO PERFORM THE ACTIVITIES FOR WHICH THE LICENSE IS

ISSUED. LICENSE CONDITIONS ARE STIPULATED IN THE LICENSE AND ARE BASED ON THE

MINING LAW.

PRODUCTION RIGHTS GRANTED PRIOR TO JANUARY

1, 2003, REMAIN SUBJECT TO THEIR EXISTING TERMS, AND DIFFER SLIGHTLY FOR

ONSHORE AND OFFSHORE AREAS. ONSHORE PRODUCTION LICENSES ISSUED PRIOR TO 1988

WERE INDEFINITE; FROM 1988 THEY WERE ISSUED FOR A PERIOD AS EXPLICITLY DEFINED

IN THE LICENSE, RANGING FROM 35 TO 45 YEARS. OFFSHORE PRODUCTION LICENSES

ACREAGE TERMS ARE FIXED BY THE GOVERNMENT AND ARE

PERIODICALLY CHANGED. FOR EXAMPLE, MANY OF THE EARLY LICENSES ISSUED UNDER THE

FIRST FOUR LICENSING ROUNDS PROVIDED FOR AN INITIAL TERM OF SIX YEARS WITH

RELINQUISHMENT OF AT LEAST ONE-HALF OF THE ORIGINAL AREA AT THE END OF THE

INITIAL TERM, SUBJECT TO EXTENSION FOR A FURTHER 40 YEARS. AT THE END OF ANY

PRODUCTION; OR LICENSES MAY CONTINUE IN DEVELOPMENT AREAS FOR PERIODS AGREED ON

A CASE-BY-CASE BASIS UNTIL THEY BECOME PRODUCING AREAS; OR LICENSES TERMINATE

IN ALL OTHER AREAS. THE LICENSING REGIME WAS LAST UPDATED IN 2002, AND THE

MAJORITY OF LICENSES ISSUED HAVE AN INITIAL TERM OF FOUR YEARS WITH A SECOND

TERM EXTENSION OF FOUR YEARS AND A FINAL TERM OF 18 YEARS WITH A MANDATORY

RELINQUISHMENT OF 50 PERCENT OF THE ACREAGE AFTER THE INITIAL TERM AND OF ALL

EQUATORIAL GUINEA

EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION ACTIVITIES ARE GOVERNED BY

PRODUCTION SHARING CONTRACTS NEGOTIATED WITH THE STATE MINISTRY OF MINES,

INDUSTRY AND ENERGY. THE EXPLORATION PERIODS ARE FOR 10 TO 15 YEARS WITH

NIGERIA

EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION ACTIVITIES IN THE DEEPWATER

OFFSHORE AREAS ARE TYPICALLY GOVERNED BY PRODUCTION SHARING CONTRACTS (PSCS)

WITH THE NATIONAL OIL COMPANY, THE NIGERIAN NATIONAL PETROLEUM CORPORATION (NNPC).

NNPC HOLDS THE UNDERLYING OIL PROSPECTING LICENSE (OPL) AND ANY RESULTING OIL

MINING LEASE (OML). THE TERMS OF THE PSCS ARE GENERALLY 30 YEARS, INCLUDING A

TEN-YEAR EXPLORATION PERIOD (AN INITIAL EXPLORATION PHASE THAT CAN BE DIVIDED

INTO MULTIPLE OPTIONAL PERIODS) COVERED BY AN OPL. UPON COMMERCIAL DISCOVERY,

AN OPL MAY BE CONVERTED TO AN OML. PARTIAL RELINQUISHMENT IS REQUIRED UNDER THE

PSC AT THE END OF THE TEN-YEAR EXPLORATION PERIOD, AND OMLS HAVE A 20-YEAR

PRODUCTION PERIOD THAT MAY BE EXTENDED.

SOME EXPLORATION ACTIVITIES ARE CARRIED

OUT IN DEEPWATER BY JOINT VENTURES WITH LOCAL COMPANIES HOLDING INTERESTS IN AN

OPL. OPLS IN DEEPWATER OFFSHORE AREAS ARE VALID FOR TEN YEARS, WHILE IN ALL

OTHER AREAS THE LICENSES ARE FOR FIVE YEARS. DEMONSTRATING A COMMERCIAL

DISCOVERY IS THE BASIS FOR CONVERSION OF AN OPL TO AN OML.

OMLS GRANTED PRIOR TO THE 1969 PETROLEUM

ACT (I.E., UNDER THE MINERAL OILS ACT 1914, REPEALED BY THE 1969 PETROLEUM ACT)

WERE FOR 30 YEARS ONSHORE AND 40 YEARS IN OFFSHORE AREAS AND HAVE BEEN RENEWED,

EFFECTIVE DECEMBER 1, 2008, FOR A FURTHER PERIOD OF 20 YEARS, WITH A FURTHER

RENEWAL OPTION OF 20 YEARS. OPERATIONS UNDER THESE PRE-1969 OMLS ARE CONDUCTED

UNDER A JOINT VENTURE AGREEMENT WITH NNPC RATHER THAN A PSC. COMMERCIAL TERMS

APPLICABLE TO THE EXISTING JOINT VENTURE OIL PRODUCTION ARE DEFINED BY THE

PETROLEUM PROFITS TAX ACT.

OMLS GRANTED UNDER THE 1969 PETROLEUM ACT,

WHICH INCLUDE ALL DEEPWATER OMLS, HAVE A MAXIMUM TERM OF 20 YEARS WITHOUT

DISTINCTION FOR ONSHORE OR OFFSHORE LOCATION AND ARE RENEWABLE, UPON 12 MONTHS’

WRITTEN NOTICE, FOR ANOTHER PERIOD OF 20 YEARS. OMLS NOT HELD BY NNPC ARE ALSO

SUBJECT TO A MANDATORY 50-PERCENT RELINQUISHMENT AFTER THE FIRST TEN YEARS OF

THEIR DURATION.

ESTABLISHED IN 2002 TO MANAGE UPSTREAM OIL AND GAS ACTIVITIES. IN 2012,

INDONESIA’S CONSTITUTIONAL COURT RULED CERTAIN ARTICLES OF LAW RELATING TO

BPMIGAS TO BE UNCONSTITUTIONAL, BUT STATED THAT ALL EXISTING PSCS SIGNED WITH

BPMIGAS SHOULD REMAIN IN FORCE UNTIL THEIR EXPIRY, AND THE FUNCTIONS AND DUTIES

PREVIOUSLY PERFORMED BY BPMIGAS ARE TO BE CARRIED OUT BY THE RELEVANT MINISTRY

OF THE GOVERNMENT OF INDONESIA UNTIL THE PROMULGATION OF A NEW OIL AND GAS LAW.

BY PRESIDENTIAL DECREE, SKKMIGAS BECAME THE INTERIM SUCCESSOR TO BPMIGAS. THE

CURRENT PSCS HAVE AN EXPLORATION PERIOD OF SIX YEARS, WHICH CAN BE EXTENDED UP

TO 10 YEARS, AND AN EXPLOITATION PERIOD OF 20 YEARS. PSCS GENERALLY REQUIRE THE

CONTRACTOR TO RELINQUISH 10 PERCENT TO 20 PERCENT OF THE CONTRACT AREA AFTER

THREE YEARS AND GENERALLY ALLOW THE CONTRACTOR TO RETAIN NO MORE THAN 50

PERCENT TO 80 PERCENT OF THE ORIGINAL CONTRACT AREA AFTER SIX YEARS, DEPENDING

ON THE ACREAGE AND TERMS.

FREQUENTLY USED TERMS

LISTED BELOW ARE DEFINITIONS OF SEVERAL OF

EXXONMOBIL’S KEY BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE MEASURES. THESE DEFINITIONS

ARE PROVIDED TO FACILITATE UNDERSTANDING OF THE TERMS AND THEIR CALCULATION.

CASH FLOW FROM OPERATIONS AND ASSET SALES

CASH

FLOW FROM OPERATIONS AND ASSET SALES IS THE SUM OF THE NET CASH PROVIDED BY

OPERATING ACTIVITIES AND PROCEEDS ASSOCIATED WITH SALES OF SUBSIDIARIES,

PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT, AND SALES AND RETURNS OF INVESTMENTS FROM THE

CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS. THIS CASH FLOW REFLECTS THE TOTAL SOURCES

OF CASH FROM BOTH OPERATING THE CORPORATION’S ASSETS AND FROM THE DIVESTING OF

ASSETS. THE CORPORATION EMPLOYS A LONG-STANDING AND REGULAR DISCIPLINED REVIEW

PROCESS TO ENSURE THAT ALL ASSETS ARE CONTRIBUTING TO THE CORPORATION’S

STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES. ASSETS ARE DIVESTED WHEN THEY ARE NO LONGER MEETING THESE

OBJECTIVES OR ARE WORTH CONSIDERABLY MORE TO OTHERS. BECAUSE OF THE REGULAR

NATURE OF THIS ACTIVITY, WE BELIEVE IT IS USEFUL FOR INVESTORS TO CONSIDER

PROCEEDS ASSOCIATED WITH ASSET SALES TOGETHER WITH CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING

ACTIVITIES WHEN EVALUATING CASH AVAILABLE FOR INVESTMENT IN THE BUSINESS AND

FINANCING ACTIVITIES, INCLUDING SHAREHOLDER DISTRIBUTIONS.

AVERAGE CAPITAL EMPLOYED

RETURN

ON AVERAGE CAPITAL EMPLOYED (ROCE) IS A PERFORMANCE MEASURE RATIO. FROM THE

PERSPECTIVE OF THE BUSINESS SEGMENTS, ROCE IS ANNUAL BUSINESS SEGMENT EARNINGS

DIVIDED BY AVERAGE BUSINESS SEGMENT CAPITAL EMPLOYED (AVERAGE OF BEGINNING AND

END-OF-YEAR AMOUNTS). THESE SEGMENT EARNINGS INCLUDE EXXONMOBIL’S SHARE OF

SEGMENT EARNINGS OF EQUITY COMPANIES, CONSISTENT WITH OUR CAPITAL EMPLOYED

DEFINITION, AND EXCLUDE THE COST OF FINANCING. THE CORPORATION’S TOTAL ROCE IS

NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO EXXONMOBIL EXCLUDING THE AFTER-TAX COST OF

FINANCING, DIVIDED BY TOTAL CORPORATE AVERAGE CAPITAL EMPLOYED. THE CORPORATION

HAS CONSISTENTLY APPLIED ITS ROCE DEFINITION FOR MANY YEARS AND VIEWS IT AS THE

BEST MEASURE OF HISTORICAL CAPITAL PRODUCTIVITY IN OUR CAPITAL-INTENSIVE,

LONG-TERM INDUSTRY, BOTH TO EVALUATE MANAGEMENT’S PERFORMANCE AND TO

DEMONSTRATE TO SHAREHOLDERS THAT CAPITAL HAS BEEN USED WISELY OVER THE LONG

TERM. ADDITIONAL MEASURES, WHICH ARE MORE CASH FLOW BASED, ARE USED TO MAKE

INVESTMENT DECISIONS.

OVERVIEW

THE

FOLLOWING DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF EXXONMOBIL’S FINANCIAL RESULTS, AS WELL AS

THE ACCOMPANYING FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND RELATED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS TO WHICH THEY REFER, ARE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE

MANAGEMENT OF EXXON MOBIL CORPORATION. THE CORPORATION’S ACCOUNTING AND

FINANCIAL REPORTING FAIRLY REFLECT ITS STRAIGHTFORWARD BUSINESS MODEL INVOLVING

THE EXTRACTING, MANUFACTURING AND MARKETING OF HYDROCARBONS AND

HYDROCARBON-BASED PRODUCTS. THE CORPORATION’S BUSINESS MODEL INVOLVES THE

PRODUCTION (OR PURCHASE), MANUFACTURE AND SALE OF PHYSICAL PRODUCTS, AND ALL

COMMERCIAL ACTIVITIES ARE DIRECTLY IN SUPPORT OF THE UNDERLYING PHYSICAL

MOVEMENT OF GOODS.

EXXONMOBIL, WITH ITS RESOURCE BASE, FINANCIAL STRENGTH,

DISCIPLINED INVESTMENT APPROACH AND TECHNOLOGY PORTFOLIO, IS WELL-POSITIONED TO

PARTICIPATE IN SUBSTANTIAL INVESTMENTS TO DEVELOP NEW ENERGY SUPPLIES. WHILE

COMMODITY PRICES ARE VOLATILE ON A SHORT-TERM BASIS AND DEPEND ON SUPPLY AND

DEMAND, EXXONMOBIL’S INVESTMENT DECISIONS ARE BASED ON OUR LONG-TERM BUSINESS

OUTLOOK, USING A DISCIPLINED APPROACH IN SELECTING AND PURSUING THE MOST

ATTRACTIVE INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES. THE CORPORATE PLAN IS A FUNDAMENTAL ANNUAL

MANAGEMENT PROCESS THAT IS THE BASIS FOR SETTING NEAR-TERM OPERATING AND

CAPITAL OBJECTIVES IN ADDITION TO PROVIDING THE LONGER-TERM ECONOMIC

ASSUMPTIONS USED FOR INVESTMENT EVALUATION PURPOSES. VOLUMES ARE BASED ON

INDIVIDUAL FIELD PRODUCTION PROFILES, WHICH ARE ALSO UPDATED ANNUALLY. PRICE

RANGES FOR CRUDE OIL, NATURAL GAS, REFINED PRODUCTS, AND CHEMICAL PRODUCTS ARE

BASED ON CORPORATE PLAN ASSUMPTIONS DEVELOPED ANNUALLY BY MAJOR REGION AND ARE UTILIZED

FOR INVESTMENT EVALUATION PURPOSES. POTENTIAL INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES ARE EVALUATED

OVER A WIDE RANGE OF ECONOMIC SCENARIOS TO ESTABLISH THE RESILIENCY OF EACH

OPPORTUNITY. ONCE INVESTMENTS ARE MADE, A REAPPRAISAL PROCESS IS COMPLETED TO

ENSURE RELEVANT LESSONS ARE LEARNED AND IMPROVEMENTS ARE INCORPORATED INTO

FUTURE PROJECTS.

BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT AND RISK ASSESSMENT

LONG-TERM BUSINESS OUTLOOK

BY

2040, THE WORLD’S POPULATION IS PROJECTED TO GROW TO APPROXIMATELY 9 BILLION

PEOPLE, OR ABOUT 2 BILLION MORE THAN IN 2010. COINCIDENT WITH THIS

POPULATION INCREASE, THE CORPORATION EXPECTS WORLDWIDE ECONOMIC GROWTH TO

AVERAGE CLOSE TO 3 PERCENT PER YEAR. AS ECONOMIES AND POPULATIONS GROW,

AND AS LIVING STANDARDS IMPROVE FOR BILLIONS OF PEOPLE, THE NEED FOR ENERGY

WILL CONTINUE TO RISE. EVEN WITH SIGNIFICANT EFFICIENCY GAINS, GLOBAL ENERGY

DEMAND IS PROJECTED TO RISE BY ABOUT 35 PERCENT FROM 2010 TO 2040. THIS

DEMAND INCREASE IS EXPECTED TO BE CONCENTRATED IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES (I.E.,

THOSE THAT ARE NOT MEMBER NATIONS OF THE ORGANISATION FOR ECONOMIC CO-OPERATION

AND DEVELOPMENT).

AS EXPANDING PROSPERITY DRIVES GLOBAL ENERGY DEMAND HIGHER,

INCREASING USE OF ENERGY-EFFICIENT AND LOWER-EMISSION FUELS, TECHNOLOGIES AND

PRACTICES WILL CONTINUE TO HELP SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE ENERGY CONSUMPTION AND

EMISSIONS PER UNIT OF ECONOMIC OUTPUT OVER TIME. SUBSTANTIAL EFFICIENCY GAINS ARE

LIKELY IN ALL KEY ASPECTS OF THE WORLD’S ECONOMY THROUGH 2040, AFFECTING ENERGY

REQUIREMENTS FOR TRANSPORTATION, POWER GENERATION, INDUSTRIAL APPLICATIONS, AND

RESIDENTIAL AND COMMERCIAL NEEDS.

ENERGY FOR TRANSPORTATION – INCLUDING CARS, TRUCKS, SHIPS,

TRAINS AND AIRPLANES – IS EXPECTED TO INCREASE BY ABOUT 40 PERCENT FROM

2010 TO 2040. THE GROWTH IN TRANSPORTATION ENERGY DEMAND IS LIKELY TO ACCOUNT

FOR APPROXIMATELY 60 PERCENT OF THE GROWTH IN LIQUID FUELS DEMAND WORLDWIDE

OVER THIS PERIOD. NEARLY ALL THE WORLD’S TRANSPORTATION FLEETS WILL CONTINUE TO

RUN ON LIQUID FUELS, WHICH ARE ABUNDANT, WIDELY AVAILABLE, EASY TO TRANSPORT,

AND PROVIDE A LARGE QUANTITY OF ENERGY IN SMALL VOLUMES.

DEMAND FOR ELECTRICITY AROUND THE WORLD IS LIKELY TO

INCREASE APPROXIMATELY 85 PERCENT BY 2040, LED BY GROWTH IN DEVELOPING

COUNTRIES. CONSISTENT WITH THIS PROJECTION, POWER GENERATION IS EXPECTED TO

REMAIN THE LARGEST AND FASTEST-GROWING MAJOR SEGMENT OF GLOBAL ENERGY DEMAND.

MEETING THE EXPECTED GROWTH IN POWER DEMAND WILL REQUIRE A DIVERSE SET OF

ENERGY SOURCES. NATURAL GAS DEMAND IS LIKELY TO GROW MOST SIGNIFICANTLY AND

BECOME THE LEADING SOURCE OF GENERATED ELECTRICITY BY 2040, REFLECTING THE

EFFICIENCY OF GAS-FIRED POWER PLANTS. TODAY, COAL HAS THE LARGEST FUEL SHARE IN

THE POWER SECTOR, BUT ITS SHARE IS LIKELY TO DECLINE SIGNIFICANTLY BY 2040 AS

POLICIES ARE GRADUALLY ADOPTED TO REDUCE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS INCLUDING THOSE

RELATED TO LOCAL AIR QUALITY AND GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS. NUCLEAR POWER AND

RENEWABLES, LED BY HYDROPOWER AND WIND, ARE ALSO EXPECTED TO GROW SIGNIFICANTLY

OVER THE PERIOD.

41

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

LIQUID FUELS PROVIDE THE LARGEST SHARE OF GLOBAL

ENERGY SUPPLIES TODAY DUE TO THEIR BROAD-BASED AVAILABILITY, AFFORDABILITY AND

EASE OF TRANSPORTATION, DISTRIBUTION AND STORAGE TO MEET CONSUMER NEEDS. BY

2040, GLOBAL DEMAND FOR LIQUID FUELS IS EXPECTED TO GROW TO APPROXIMATELY 115 MILLION

BARRELS OF OIL‐EQUIVALENT PER DAY, AN INCREASE OF ALMOST 30 PERCENT

FROM 2010. GLOBALLY, CRUDE PRODUCTION FROM TRADITIONAL CONVENTIONAL SOURCES

WILL LIKELY DECREASE SLIGHTLY THROUGH 2040, WITH SIGNIFICANT DEVELOPMENT

ACTIVITY MOSTLY OFFSETTING NATURAL DECLINES FROM THESE FIELDS. HOWEVER, THIS

DECREASE IS EXPECTED TO BE MORE THAN OFFSET BY RISING PRODUCTION FROM A VARIETY

OF EMERGING SUPPLY SOURCES – INCLUDING TIGHT OIL, DEEPWATER, OIL SANDS, NATURAL

GAS LIQUIDS AND BIOFUELS. THE WORLD’S RESOURCE BASE IS SUFFICIENT TO MEET

PROJECTED DEMAND THROUGH 2040 AS TECHNOLOGY ADVANCES CONTINUE TO EXPAND THE

AVAILABILITY OF ECONOMIC SUPPLY OPTIONS. HOWEVER, ACCESS TO RESOURCES AND

TIMELY INVESTMENTS WILL REMAIN CRITICAL TO MEETING GLOBAL NEEDS WITH RELIABLE,

AFFORDABLE SUPPLIES.

NATURAL GAS IS A VERSATILE FUEL, SUITABLE FOR A WIDE

VARIETY OF APPLICATIONS, AND IS EXPECTED TO BE THE FASTEST GROWING MAJOR FUEL

SOURCE THROUGH 2040. GLOBAL DEMAND IS EXPECTED TO RISE ABOUT 65 PERCENT

FROM 2010 TO 2040, WITH ABOUT HALF OF THAT INCREASE IN THE ASIA PACIFIC REGION.

HELPING MEET THESE NEEDS WILL BE SIGNIFICANT GROWTH IN SUPPLIES OF

UNCONVENTIONAL GAS – THE NATURAL GAS FOUND IN SHALE AND OTHER ROCK FORMATIONS

THAT WAS ONCE CONSIDERED UNECONOMIC TO PRODUCE. ABOUT TWO-THIRDS OF THE GROWTH

IN NATURAL GAS SUPPLIES IS EXPECTED TO BE FROM UNCONVENTIONAL SOURCES, WHICH

WILL ACCOUNT FOR CLOSE TO 35 PERCENT OF GLOBAL GAS SUPPLIES BY 2040. THE

WORLDWIDE LIQUEFIED NATURAL GAS (LNG) MARKET IS EXPECTED TO MORE THAN TRIPLE BY

2040, STIMULATED BY GROWING NATURAL GAS DEMAND.

THE WORLD’S ENERGY MIX IS HIGHLY DIVERSE AND WILL REMAIN SO

THROUGH 2040. OIL IS EXPECTED TO REMAIN THE LARGEST SOURCE OF ENERGY WITH ITS

SHARE REMAINING CLOSE TO ONE-THIRD IN 2040. COAL IS CURRENTLY THE SECOND

LARGEST SOURCE OF ENERGY, BUT IT IS LIKELY TO LOSE THAT POSITION TO NATURAL GAS

IN THE 2025-2030 TIMEFRAME. THE SHARE OF NATURAL GAS IS EXPECTED TO EXCEED 25 PERCENT

BY 2040, WHILE THE SHARE OF COAL FALLS TO LESS THAN 20 PERCENT. NUCLEAR

POWER IS PROJECTED TO GROW SIGNIFICANTLY, AS MANY NATIONS EXPAND NUCLEAR

CAPACITY TO ADDRESS RISING ELECTRICITY NEEDS AS WELL AS ENERGY SECURITY AND

ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES. TOTAL RENEWABLE ENERGY IS LIKELY TO REACH ABOUT 15 PERCENT

OF TOTAL ENERGY BY 2040, WITH BIOMASS, HYDRO AND GEOTHERMAL CONTRIBUTING A

COMBINED SHARE OF MORE THAN 10 PERCENT. TOTAL ENERGY SUPPLIED FROM WIND,

SOLAR AND BIOFUELS IS EXPECTED TO INCREASE CLOSE TO 450 PERCENT FROM 2010

TO 2040, WHEN THEY WILL BE APPROACHING 4 PERCENT OF WORLD ENERGY.

THE CORPORATION ANTICIPATES THAT THE WORLD’S AVAILABLE OIL

AND GAS RESOURCE BASE WILL GROW NOT ONLY FROM NEW DISCOVERIES, BUT ALSO FROM

RESERVE INCREASES IN PREVIOUSLY DISCOVERED FIELDS. TECHNOLOGY WILL UNDERPIN

THESE INCREASES. THE COST TO DEVELOP AND SUPPLY THESE RESOURCES WILL BE

SIGNIFICANT. ACCORDING TO THE INTERNATIONAL ENERGY AGENCY, THE INVESTMENT

REQUIRED TO MEET TOTAL OIL AND GAS ENERGY NEEDS WORLDWIDE OVER THE PERIOD 2014‐2040

WILL BE ABOUT $28 TRILLION (MEASURED IN 2013 DOLLARS) OR MORE THAN $1 TRILLION

PER YEAR ON AVERAGE.

INTERNATIONAL ACCORDS AND UNDERLYING REGIONAL AND NATIONAL

REGULATIONS COVERING GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS ARE EVOLVING WITH UNCERTAIN

TIMING AND OUTCOME, MAKING IT DIFFICULT TO PREDICT THEIR BUSINESS IMPACT.

EXXONMOBIL INCLUDES ESTIMATES OF POTENTIAL COSTS RELATED TO POSSIBLE PUBLIC

POLICIES COVERING ENERGY-RELATED GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS IN ITS LONG-TERM

OUTLOOK

FOR ENERGY

, WHICH IS USED AS A FOUNDATION FOR ASSESSING THE BUSINESS

ENVIRONMENT AND IN ITS INVESTMENT EVALUATIONS.

THE INFORMATION PROVIDED IN THE LONG-TERM BUSINESS OUTLOOK

INCLUDES EXXONMOBIL’S INTERNAL ESTIMATES AND FORECASTS BASED UPON INTERNAL DATA

AND ANALYSES AS WELL AS PUBLICLY AVAILABLE INFORMATION FROM EXTERNAL SOURCES

UPSTREAM

EXXONMOBIL

CONTINUES TO MAINTAIN A DIVERSE PORTFOLIO OF EXPLORATION AND DEVELOPMENT

OPPORTUNITIES, WHICH ENABLES THE CORPORATION TO BE SELECTIVE, MAXIMIZING

SHAREHOLDER VALUE AND MITIGATING POLITICAL AND TECHNICAL RISKS. EXXONMOBIL’S

FUNDAMENTAL UPSTREAM BUSINESS STRATEGIES GUIDE OUR GLOBAL EXPLORATION,

DEVELOPMENT, PRODUCTION, AND GAS AND POWER MARKETING ACTIVITIES. THESE

STRATEGIES INCLUDE CAPTURING MATERIAL AND ACCRETIVE OPPORTUNITIES TO

CONTINUALLY HIGH-GRADE THE RESOURCE PORTFOLIO, EXERCISING A DISCIPLINED

APPROACH TO INVESTING AND COST MANAGEMENT, DEVELOPING AND APPLYING HIGH-IMPACT

TECHNOLOGIES, PURSUING PRODUCTIVITY AND EFFICIENCY GAINS, GROWING PROFITABLE

OIL AND GAS PRODUCTION, AND CAPITALIZING ON GROWING NATURAL GAS AND POWER

MARKETS. THESE STRATEGIES ARE UNDERPINNED BY A RELENTLESS FOCUS ON OPERATIONAL

EXCELLENCE, COMMITMENT TO INNOVATIVE TECHNOLOGIES, DEVELOPMENT OF OUR

EMPLOYEES, AND INVESTMENT IN THE COMMUNITIES WITHIN WHICH WE OPERATE.

AS FUTURE DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS AND DRILLING ACTIVITIES

BRING NEW PRODUCTION ONLINE, THE CORPORATION EXPECTS A SHIFT IN THE GEOGRAPHIC

MIX AND IN THE TYPE OF OPPORTUNITIES FROM WHICH VOLUMES ARE PRODUCED. OIL EQUIVALENT

PRODUCTION FROM NORTH AMERICA IS EXPECTED TO INCREASE OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL

YEARS BASED ON CURRENT CAPITAL ACTIVITY PLANS, CONTRIBUTING OVER A THIRD OF

TOTAL PRODUCTION. FURTHER, THE PROPORTION OF OUR GLOBAL PRODUCTION FROM RESOURCE

TYPES UTILIZING SPECIALIZED TECHNOLOGIES SUCH AS ARCTIC, DEEPWATER, AND

UNCONVENTIONAL DRILLING AND PRODUCTION SYSTEMS, AS WELL AS LNG, IS ALSO EXPECTED

TO GROW, BECOMING A SLIGHT MAJORITY OF PRODUCTION IN THE NEXT FEW YEARS. WE DO

NOT ANTICIPATE THAT THE EXPECTED CHANGE IN THE GEOGRAPHIC MIX OF PRODUCTION

VOLUMES, AND IN THE TYPES OF OPPORTUNITIES FROM WHICH VOLUMES WILL BE PRODUCED,

WILL HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE

THE CORPORATION’S OVERALL VOLUME CAPACITY OUTLOOK, BASED ON

PROJECTS COMING ONSTREAM AS ANTICIPATED, IS FOR PRODUCTION CAPACITY TO GROW OVER

THE NEXT FEW YEARS. HOWEVER, ACTUAL VOLUMES WILL VARY FROM YEAR TO YEAR DUE TO

THE TIMING OF INDIVIDUAL PROJECT START-UPS AND OTHER CAPITAL ACTIVITIES,

OPERATIONAL OUTAGES, RESERVOIR PERFORMANCE, PERFORMANCE OF ENHANCED OIL

RECOVERY PROJECTS, REGULATORY CHANGES, THE IMPACT OF FISCAL AND COMMERCIAL

TERMS, ASSET SALES, WEATHER EVENTS, PRICE EFFECTS ON PRODUCTION SHARING

CONTRACTS AND OTHER FACTORS DESCRIBED IN ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS. ENHANCED OIL

RECOVERY PROJECTS EXTRACT HYDROCARBONS FROM RESERVOIRS IN EXCESS OF THAT WHICH

MAY BE PRODUCED THROUGH PRIMARY RECOVERY, I.E., THROUGH PRESSURE DEPLETION OR

NATURAL AQUIFER SUPPORT. THEY INCLUDE THE INJECTION OF WATER, GASES OR CHEMICALS

INTO A RESERVOIR TO PRODUCE HYDROCARBONS OTHERWISE UNOBTAINABLE.

THE MARKETS FOR CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS HAVE A HISTORY OF

SIGNIFICANT PRICE VOLATILITY. AFTER SOME YEARS OF RELATIVELY STABLE PRICES, THE

END OF 2014 SAW CRUDE PRICES DROP TO LEVELS NOT SEEN SINCE 2009. EXXONMOBIL

BELIEVES PRICES OVER THE LONG TERM WILL CONTINUE TO BE DRIVEN BY MARKET SUPPLY

AND DEMAND, WITH THE DEMAND SIDE LARGELY BEING A FUNCTION OF GLOBAL ECONOMIC

GROWTH. TO MANAGE THE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH PRICE, EXXONMOBIL EVALUATES ANNUAL

PLANS AND ALL INVESTMENTS ACROSS A WIDE RANGE OF PRICE SCENARIOS. THE

CORPORATION’S ASSESSMENT IS THAT ITS OPERATIONS WILL CONTINUE TO BE SUCCESSFUL

IN A VARIETY OF MARKET CONDITIONS. THIS IS THE OUTCOME OF DISCIPLINED

INVESTMENT, COST MANAGEMENT, AND ASSET ENHANCEMENT PROGRAMS.

DOWNSTREAM

EXXONMOBIL’S

DOWNSTREAM IS A LARGE, DIVERSIFIED BUSINESS WITH REFINING, LOGISTICS, AND

MARKETING COMPLEXES AROUND THE WORLD. THE CORPORATION HAS A PRESENCE IN MATURE

MARKETS IN NORTH AMERICA AND EUROPE, AS WELL AS IN THE GROWING ASIA PACIFIC

REGION. EXXONMOBIL’S FUNDAMENTAL DOWNSTREAM BUSINESS STRATEGIES POSITION THE

COMPANY TO DELIVER LONG-TERM GROWTH IN SHAREHOLDER VALUE THAT IS SUPERIOR TO

COMPETITION ACROSS A RANGE OF MARKET CONDITIONS. THESE STRATEGIES INCLUDE TARGETING

BEST‐IN‐CLASS OPERATIONS IN ALL ASPECTS OF THE BUSINESS, MAXIMIZING

VALUE FROM ADVANCED TECHNOLOGIES, CAPITALIZING ON INTEGRATION ACROSS EXXONMOBIL

BUSINESSES, SELECTIVELY INVESTING FOR RESILIENT, ADVANTAGED RETURNS, OPERATING

EFFICIENTLY AND EFFECTIVELY, AND PROVIDING QUALITY, VALUED PRODUCTS AND

SERVICES TO CUSTOMERS.

EXXONMOBIL HAS AN OWNERSHIP INTEREST IN 30 REFINERIES,

LOCATED IN 17 COUNTRIES, WITH DISTILLATION CAPACITY OF 5.2 MILLION

BARRELS PER DAY AND LUBRICANT BASESTOCK MANUFACTURING CAPACITY OF 131 THOUSAND

BARRELS PER DAY. EXXONMOBIL’S FUELS AND LUBES MARKETING BUSINESSES HAVE SIGNIFICANT

GLOBAL REACH, WITH MULTIPLE CHANNELS TO MARKET SERVING A DIVERSE CUSTOMER BASE.

OUR PORTFOLIO OF WORLD-RENOWNED BRANDS INCLUDES

EXXON

AND

MOBIL 1.

THE DOWNSTREAM INDUSTRY ENVIRONMENT REMAINS CHALLENGING. DEMAND

WEAKNESS AND OVERCAPACITY IN THE REFINING SECTOR WILL CONTINUE TO INCREASE

COMPETITIVE PRESSURE. IN THE NEAR TERM, WE SEE VARIABILITY IN REFINING MARGINS,

WITH SOME REGIONS SEEING WEAKER MARGINS AS NEW CAPACITY ADDITIONS OUTPACE

GLOBAL DEMAND. IN NORTH AMERICA, LOWER RAW MATERIAL AND ENERGY COST DRIVEN BY

INCREASING CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS PRODUCTION HAS STRENGTHENED REFINING

MARGINS OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS.

REFINING MARGINS ARE LARGELY DRIVEN BY DIFFERENCES IN

COMMODITY PRICES AND ARE A FUNCTION OF THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WHAT A REFINERY

PAYS FOR ITS RAW MATERIALS (PRIMARILY CRUDE OIL) AND THE MARKET PRICES FOR THE

RANGE OF PRODUCTS PRODUCED (PRIMARILY GASOLINE, HEATING OIL, DIESEL OIL, JET

FUEL AND FUEL OIL). CRUDE OIL AND MANY PRODUCTS ARE WIDELY TRADED WITH

PUBLISHED PRICES, INCLUDING THOSE QUOTED ON MULTIPLE EXCHANGES AROUND THE WORLD

(E.G., NEW YORK MERCANTILE EXCHANGE AND INTERCONTINENTAL EXCHANGE). PRICES FOR

THESE COMMODITIES ARE DETERMINED BY THE GLOBAL MARKETPLACE AND ARE INFLUENCED

BY MANY FACTORS, INCLUDING GLOBAL AND REGIONAL SUPPLY/DEMAND BALANCES,

INVENTORY LEVELS, INDUSTRY REFINERY OPERATIONS, IMPORT/EXPORT BALANCES,

CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS, SEASONAL DEMAND, WEATHER AND POLITICAL CLIMATE.

EXXONMOBIL’S LONG‐TERM OUTLOOK IS THAT INDUSTRY REFINING

MARGINS WILL REMAIN SUBJECT TO INTENSE COMPETITION AS, IN THE NEAR TERM, NEW

CAPACITY ADDITIONS OUTPACE THE GROWTH IN GLOBAL DEMAND. ADDITIONALLY, AS

DESCRIBED IN MORE DETAIL IN ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS, PROPOSED CARBON POLICY AND

OTHER CLIMATE-RELATED REGULATIONS IN MANY COUNTRIES, AS WELL AS THE CONTINUED

GROWTH IN BIOFUELS MANDATES, COULD HAVE NEGATIVE IMPACTS ON THE REFINING

BUSINESS. EXXONMOBIL’S INTEGRATION ACROSS THE VALUE CHAIN, FROM REFINING TO

MARKETING, ENHANCES OVERALL VALUE IN BOTH FUELS AND LUBRICANTS BUSINESSES.

IN THE RETAIL FUELS MARKETING BUSINESS, COMPETITION HAS

CAUSED INFLATION-ADJUSTED MARGINS TO DECLINE. IN 2014, EXXONMOBIL EXPANDED ITS

BRANDED RETAIL SITE NETWORK IN THE U.S. AND PROGRESSED THE MULTI‐YEAR

TRANSITION OF THE DIRECT SERVED (I.E., DEALER, COMPANY‐OPERATED) RETAIL

NETWORK IN PORTIONS OF EUROPE TO A MORE CAPITAL‐EFFICIENT BRANDED

DISTRIBUTOR MODEL. EXXONMOBIL IS INCREASING INVESTMENT IN ITS FUELS BRANDS AND

DEVELOPING MULTIPLE PROGRAMS THAT WILL ENHANCE THE VALUE OF ITS CONSUMER RETAIL

OFFER. THE COMPANY’S LUBRICANTS BUSINESS CONTINUES TO GROW, LEVERAGING

WORLD-CLASS BRANDS AND INTEGRATION WITH INDUSTRY‐LEADING BASESTOCK

REFINING CAPABILITY. EXXONMOBIL REMAINS A MARKET LEADER IN THE HIGH‐VALUE

SYNTHETIC LUBRICANTS SECTOR WHERE COMPETITION IS INCREASING.

THE DOWNSTREAM PORTFOLIO IS CONTINUALLY EVALUATED DURING ALL

PARTS OF THE BUSINESS CYCLE, AND NUMEROUS ASSET DIVESTMENTS HAVE BEEN MADE OVER

THE PAST DECADE. WHEN INVESTING IN THE DOWNSTREAM, EXXONMOBIL REMAINS FOCUSED

ON SELECTIVE AND RESILIENT

PROJECTS. THESE INVESTMENTS

CAPITALIZE ON THE CORPORATION’S WORLD‐CLASS SCALE AND INTEGRATION, DEMONSTRATED

EFFICIENCY, ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY AND RESPECTED BRANDS, ENABLING EXXONMOBIL TO

TAKE ADVANTAGE OF ATTRACTIVE EMERGING GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES AROUND THE GLOBE. IN

2014, THE COMPANY COMMISSIONED THE CLEAN FUELS PROJECT AT THE JOINT SAUDI

ARAMCO AND EXXONMOBIL SAMREF REFINERY IN YANBU, SAUDI ARABIA, TO PRODUCE LOW

SULFUR GASOLINE AND ULTRA‐LOW SULFUR DIESEL. CONSTRUCTION STARTED ON A

NEW DELAYED COKER UNIT AT THE REFINERY IN ANTWERP, BELGIUM, TO UPGRADE

LOW-VALUE BUNKER FUEL INTO HIGH‐VALUE DIESEL PRODUCTS. THE COMPANY ALSO

COMPLETED AN EXPANSION OF LUBE BASESTOCK CAPACITY AT THE REFINERY IN SINGAPORE,

AND NEARED COMPLETION ON A LUBE BASESTOCK EXPANSION IN BAYTOWN, TEXAS. A

FINISHED LUBRICANT PLANT EXPANSION IN TIANJIN, CHINA, WAS COMPLETED AND

ADDITIONAL LUBRICANT PLANT EXPANSIONS IN CHINA, SINGAPORE, FINLAND, AND THE

U.S. ARE UNDERWAY TO SUPPORT DEMAND GROWTH FOR FINISHED LUBRICANTS AND GREASES

IN KEY MARKETS.

CHEMICAL

WORLDWIDE

PETROCHEMICAL DEMAND CONTINUED TO IMPROVE IN 2014, LED BY GROWING DEMAND FROM

ASIA PACIFIC MANUFACTURERS OF INDUSTRIAL AND CONSUMER PRODUCTS. NORTH AMERICA

CONTINUED TO BENEFIT FROM ABUNDANT SUPPLIES OF NATURAL GAS AND GAS LIQUIDS,

PROVIDING BOTH LOW-COST FEEDSTOCK AND ENERGY SAVINGS. SPECIALTY PRODUCT MARGINS

DECLINED REFLECTING SIGNIFICANT NEW INDUSTRY CAPACITY.

EXXONMOBIL SUSTAINED ITS COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE THROUGH

CONTINUED OPERATIONAL EXCELLENCE, INVESTMENT AND COST DISCIPLINE, A BALANCED

PORTFOLIO OF PRODUCTS, INTEGRATION WITH REFINING AND UPSTREAM OPERATIONS, ALL

UNDERPINNED BY PROPRIETARY TECHNOLOGY.

IN 2014, EXXONMOBIL BEGAN CONSTRUCTION OF A MAJOR EXPANSION

AT OUR TEXAS FACILITIES, INCLUDING A NEW WORLD-SCALE ETHANE CRACKER AND

POLYETHYLENE LINES, TO CAPITALIZE ON LOW-COST FEEDSTOCK AND ENERGY SUPPLIES IN

NORTH AMERICA AND MEET RAPIDLY GROWING DEMAND FOR PREMIUM POLYMERS.

CONSTRUCTION OF NEW HALOBUTYL RUBBER AND HYDROCARBON RESIN UNITS ALSO STARTED

IN SINGAPORE TO FURTHER EXTEND OUR SPECIALTY PRODUCT CAPACITY IN ASIA. AT THE

JOINT VENTURE FACILITY IN AL-JUBAIL, SAUDI ARABIA, CONSTRUCTION CONTINUED ON

THE SPECIALTY ELASTOMERS PROJECT THAT IS EXPECTED TO START-UP IN 2015.

YEAR-END 2013 WAS $0.3 BILLION OF RESTRICTED CASH. FOR ADDITIONAL DETAILS, SEE

THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS.

THE CORPORATION HAS ACCESS TO SIGNIFICANT CAPACITY OF LONG-TERM

AND SHORT-TERM LIQUIDITY. INTERNALLY GENERATED FUNDS ARE EXPECTED TO COVER THE

MAJORITY OF FINANCIAL REQUIREMENTS, SUPPLEMENTED BY LONG-TERM AND SHORT-TERM

DEBT. ON DECEMBER 31, 2014, THE CORPORATION HAD UNUSED COMMITTED SHORT-TERM

LINES OF CREDIT OF $6.3 BILLION AND UNUSED COMMITTED LONG-TERM LINES OF CREDIT

OF $0.5 BILLION. CASH THAT MAY BE TEMPORARILY AVAILABLE AS SURPLUS TO THE

CORPORATION’S IMMEDIATE NEEDS IS CAREFULLY MANAGED THROUGH COUNTERPARTY QUALITY

AND INVESTMENT GUIDELINES TO ENSURE IT IS SECURE AND READILY AVAILABLE TO MEET

THE CORPORATION’S CASH REQUIREMENTS AND TO OPTIMIZE RETURNS.

TO SUPPORT CASH FLOWS IN FUTURE PERIODS THE CORPORATION

WILL NEED TO CONTINUALLY FIND AND DEVELOP NEW FIELDS, AND CONTINUE TO DEVELOP

AND APPLY NEW TECHNOLOGIES AND RECOVERY PROCESSES TO EXISTING FIELDS, IN ORDER

TO MAINTAIN OR INCREASE PRODUCTION. AFTER A PERIOD OF PRODUCTION AT PLATEAU

RATES, IT IS THE NATURE OF OIL AND GAS FIELDS EVENTUALLY TO PRODUCE AT

DECLINING RATES FOR THE REMAINDER OF THEIR ECONOMIC LIFE. AVERAGED OVER ALL THE

CORPORATION’S EXISTING OIL AND GAS FIELDS AND WITHOUT NEW PROJECTS, EXXONMOBIL’S

PRODUCTION IS EXPECTED TO DECLINE AT AN AVERAGE OF APPROXIMATELY 3 PERCENT PER

YEAR OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS. DECLINE RATES CAN VARY WIDELY BY INDIVIDUAL FIELD

DUE TO A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE TYPE OF

RESERVOIR, FLUID PROPERTIES, RECOVERY MECHANISMS, WORK ACTIVITY, AND AGE OF THE

FIELD. FURTHERMORE, THE CORPORATION’S NET INTEREST IN PRODUCTION FOR INDIVIDUAL

FIELDS CAN VARY WITH PRICE AND THE IMPACT OF FISCAL AND COMMERCIAL TERMS.

THE CORPORATION HAS LONG BEEN SUCCESSFUL AT OFFSETTING THE

EFFECTS OF NATURAL FIELD DECLINE THROUGH DISCIPLINED INVESTMENTS IN QUALITY

OPPORTUNITIES AND PROJECT EXECUTION. OVER THE LAST DECADE, THIS HAS RESULTED IN

NET ANNUAL ADDITIONS TO PROVED RESERVES THAT HAVE EXCEEDED THE AMOUNT PRODUCED.

PROJECTS ARE IN PROGRESS OR PLANNED TO INCREASE PRODUCTION CAPACITY. HOWEVER,

THESE VOLUME INCREASES ARE SUBJECT TO A VARIETY OF RISKS INCLUDING PROJECT

START-UP TIMING, OPERATIONAL OUTAGES, RESERVOIR PERFORMANCE, THE IMPACT OF

FISCAL AND COMMERCIAL TERMS, CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS PRICES, WEATHER EVENTS,

AND REGULATORY CHANGES. THE CORPORATION’S CASH FLOWS ARE ALSO HIGHLY DEPENDENT

ON CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS PRICES. PLEASE REFER TO ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS

FOR A MORE COMPLETE DISCUSSION OF RISKS.

THE CORPORATION’S FINANCIAL STRENGTH ENABLES IT TO MAKE LARGE,

LONG-TERM CAPITAL EXPENDITURES. CAPITAL AND EXPLORATION EXPENDITURES IN 2014

WERE $38.5 BILLION, REFLECTING THE CORPORATION’S CONTINUED ACTIVE INVESTMENT

PROGRAM. THE CORPORATION ANTICIPATES AN AVERAGE INVESTMENT PROFILE OF ABOUT $34

BILLION

PER YEAR FOR THE NEXT FEW YEARS. ACTUAL

SPENDING COULD VARY DEPENDING ON THE PROGRESS OF INDIVIDUAL PROJECTS AND

PROPERTY ACQUISITIONS. THE CORPORATION HAS A LARGE AND DIVERSE PORTFOLIO OF

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS AND EXPLORATION OPPORTUNITIES, WHICH

HELPS MITIGATE THE OVERALL POLITICAL AND TECHNICAL RISKS OF THE CORPORATION’S

UPSTREAM SEGMENT AND ASSOCIATED CASH FLOW. FURTHER, DUE TO ITS FINANCIAL

STRENGTH, DEBT CAPACITY AND DIVERSE PORTFOLIO OF OPPORTUNITIES, THE RISK

ASSOCIATED WITH FAILURE OR DELAY OF ANY SINGLE PROJECT WOULD NOT HAVE A

SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE CORPORATION’S LIQUIDITY OR ABILITY TO GENERATE

SUFFICIENT CASH FLOWS FOR OPERATIONS AND ITS FIXED COMMITMENTS. THE PURCHASE

AND SALE OF OIL AND GAS PROPERTIES HAVE NOT HAD A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE

AMOUNT OR TIMING OF CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES.

TOTALED $45.1 BILLION IN 2014, $0.2 BILLION HIGHER THAN 2013. THE MAJOR SOURCE

OF FUNDS WAS NET INCOME INCLUDING NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS OF $33.6 BILLION, AN

INCREASE OF $0.2 BILLION. THE NONCASH PROVISION FOR DEPRECIATION AND DEPLETION

WAS $17.3 BILLION, UP $0.1 BILLION FROM THE PRIOR YEAR. THE ADJUSTMENT FOR NET

GAINS ON ASSET SALES WAS $3.2 BILLION COMPARED TO AN ADJUSTMENT OF $1.8 BILLION

IN 2013. CHANGES IN OPERATIONAL WORKING CAPITAL, EXCLUDING CASH AND DEBT,

DECREASED CASH IN 2014 BY $4.9 BILLION.

2013

CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES

TOTALED $44.9 BILLION IN 2013, $11.3 BILLION LOWER THAN 2012. THE MAJOR SOURCE

OF FUNDS WAS NET INCOME INCLUDING NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS OF $33.4 BILLION, A

DECREASE OF $14.2 BILLION. THE NONCASH PROVISION OF $17.2 BILLION FOR

DEPRECIATION AND DEPLETION WAS HIGHER THAN 2012. THE ADJUSTMENT FOR NET GAINS

ON ASSET SALES WAS $1.8 BILLION COMPARED TO AN ADJUSTMENT OF $13.0 BILLION IN

2012. CHANGES IN OPERATIONAL WORKING CAPITAL, EXCLUDING CASH AND DEBT,

DECREASED CASH IN 2013 BY $4.7 BILLION.

CASH FLOW FROM

INVESTING ACTIVITIES

2014

CASH USED IN INVESTMENT ACTIVITIES NETTED TO $27.0 BILLION

IN 2014, $7.2 BILLION LOWER THAN 2013. SPENDING FOR PROPERTY, PLANT AND

EQUIPMENT OF $33.0 BILLION DECREASED $0.7 BILLION FROM 2013. PROCEEDS

ASSOCIATED WITH SALES OF SUBSIDIARIES, PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT, AND SALES

AND RETURNS OF INVESTMENTS OF $4.0 BILLION COMPARED TO $2.7 BILLION IN 2013.

ADDITIONAL INVESTMENTS AND ADVANCES WERE $2.8 BILLION LOWER IN 2014, WHILE

COLLECTION OF ADVANCES WAS $2.2 BILLION HIGHER IN 2014.

2013

CASH USED IN INVESTMENT ACTIVITIES NETTED TO $34.2 BILLION

IN 2013, $8.6 BILLION HIGHER THAN 2012. SPENDING FOR PROPERTY, PLANT AND

EQUIPMENT OF $33.7 BILLION DECREASED $0.6 BILLION FROM 2012. PROCEEDS

ASSOCIATED WITH SALES OF SUBSIDIARIES, PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT, AND SALES

AND RETURNS OF INVESTMENTS OF $2.7 BILLION COMPARED TO $7.7 BILLION IN 2012.

ADDITIONAL INVESTMENTS AND ADVANCES WERE $3.8 BILLION HIGHER IN 2013.

CASH FLOW FROM

FINANCING ACTIVITIES

2014

CASH

USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES WAS $17.9 BILLION IN 2014, $2.4 BILLION HIGHER

THAN 2013. DIVIDEND PAYMENTS ON COMMON SHARES INCREASED TO $2.70 PER SHARE FROM

$2.46 PER SHARE AND TOTALED $11.6 BILLION, A PAY-OUT OF 36 PERCENT OF NET INCOME.

DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2014, THE CORPORATION ISSUED $5.5 BILLION OF

LONG-TERM DEBT. TOTAL DEBT INCREASED $6.4 BILLION TO $29.1 BILLION AT YEAR‐END.

EXXONMOBIL SHARE OF EQUITY INCREASED $0.4 BILLION TO $174.4

BILLION. THE ADDITION TO EQUITY FOR EARNINGS WAS $32.5 BILLION. THIS WAS OFFSET

BY REDUCTIONS FOR DISTRIBUTIONS TO EXXONMOBIL SHAREHOLDERS OF $23.6 BILLION, COMPOSED

OF $11.6 BILLION IN DIVIDENDS AND $12.0 BILLION OF SHARE PURCHASES OF EXXONMOBIL

STOCK TO REDUCE SHARES OUTSTANDING. FOREIGN EXCHANGE TRANSLATION EFFECTS OF

$5.1 BILLION FOR THE STRONGER U.S. CURRENCY AND A $3.1 BILLION CHANGE IN THE

FUNDED STATUS OF THE POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS RESERVES ALSO REDUCED EQUITY.

DURING 2014, EXXON

MOBIL CORPORATION PURCHASED 136 MILLION SHARES OF ITS COMMON STOCK FOR THE

TREASURY AT A GROSS COST OF $13.2 BILLION. THESE PURCHASES WERE TO REDUCE THE

NUMBER OF SHARES OUTSTANDING AND TO OFFSET SHARES ISSUED IN CONJUNCTION WITH

COMPANY BENEFIT PLANS AND PROGRAMS. SHARES OUTSTANDING WERE REDUCED BY 3.1

PERCENT FROM 4,335 MILLION TO 4,201 MILLION AT THE END OF 2014. PURCHASES WERE

MADE IN BOTH THE OPEN MARKET AND THROUGH NEGOTIATED TRANSACTIONS. PURCHASES MAY

BE INCREASED, DECREASED OR DISCONTINUED AT ANY TIME WITHOUT PRIOR NOTICE.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

2013

CASH

USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES WAS $15.5 BILLION IN 2013, $18.4 BILLION LOWER

THAN 2012. DIVIDEND PAYMENTS ON COMMON SHARES INCREASED TO $2.46 PER SHARE FROM

$2.18 PER SHARE AND TOTALED $10.9 BILLION, A PAY-OUT OF 33 PERCENT OF NET

INCOME. TOTAL DEBT INCREASED $11.1 BILLION TO $22.7 BILLION AT YEAR‐END.

EXXONMOBIL SHARE OF EQUITY INCREASED $8.1 BILLION TO $174.0

BILLION. THE ADDITION TO EQUITY FOR EARNINGS OF $32.6 BILLION WAS PARTIALLY

OFFSET BY REDUCTIONS FOR DISTRIBUTIONS TO EXXONMOBIL SHAREHOLDERS OF $10.9

BILLION OF DIVIDENDS AND $15.0 BILLION OF PURCHASES OF SHARES OF EXXONMOBIL

STOCK TO REDUCE SHARES OUTSTANDING.

DURING 2013, EXXON

MOBIL CORPORATION PURCHASED 177 MILLION SHARES OF ITS COMMON STOCK FOR THE

TREASURY AT A GROSS COST OF $16.0 BILLION. THESE PURCHASES WERE TO REDUCE THE

NUMBER OF SHARES OUTSTANDING AND TO OFFSET SHARES ISSUED IN CONJUNCTION WITH

COMPANY BENEFIT PLANS AND PROGRAMS. SHARES OUTSTANDING WERE REDUCED BY 3.7

PERCENT FROM 4,502 MILLION TO 4,335 MILLION AT THE END OF 2013. PURCHASES WERE

MADE IN BOTH THE OPEN MARKET AND THROUGH NEGOTIATED TRANSACTIONS.

FIXED OR MINIMUM PRICE) WHICH ARE RESOLD SHORTLY AFTER PURCHASE, EITHER IN AN

ACTIVE, HIGHLY LIQUID MARKET OR UNDER LONG-TERM, UNCONDITIONAL SALES CONTRACTS

WITH SIMILAR PRICING TERMS. EXAMPLES INCLUDE LONG-TERM, NONCANCELABLE LNG AND

NATURAL GAS PURCHASE COMMITMENTS AND COMMITMENTS TO PURCHASE REFINERY PRODUCTS

AT MARKET PRICES. INCLUSION OF SUCH COMMITMENTS WOULD NOT BE MEANINGFUL IN

ASSESSING LIQUIDITY AND CASH FLOW, BECAUSE THESE PURCHASES WILL BE OFFSET IN

THE SAME PERIODS BY CASH RECEIVED FROM THE RELATED SALES TRANSACTIONS. THE

TABLE ALSO EXCLUDES UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS TOTALING $9.0 BILLION AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2014, BECAUSE THE CORPORATION IS UNABLE TO MAKE REASONABLY

RELIABLE ESTIMATES OF THE TIMING OF CASH SETTLEMENTS WITH THE RESPECTIVE TAXING

AUTHORITIES. FURTHER DETAILS ON THE UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS CAN BE FOUND IN

NOTE 19, INCOME, SALES-BASED AND OTHER TAXES.

NOTES.

(1)   INCLUDES CAPITALIZED LEASE

OBLIGATIONS OF $375 MILLION.

(2)   THE AMOUNT DUE IN ONE YEAR IS

INCLUDED IN NOTES AND LOANS PAYABLE OF $17,468 MILLION.

(3)   THE FAIR VALUE OF ASSET RETIREMENT

OBLIGATIONS, PRIMARILY UPSTREAM ASSET REMOVAL COSTS AT THE COMPLETION OF FIELD

LIFE.

(4)   THE AMOUNT BY WHICH THE BENEFIT

OBLIGATIONS EXCEEDED THE FAIR VALUE OF FUND ASSETS FOR CERTAIN U.S. AND

NON-U.S. PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT PLANS AT YEAR END. THE PAYMENTS BY

PERIOD INCLUDE EXPECTED CONTRIBUTIONS TO FUNDED PENSION PLANS IN 2015 AND

ESTIMATED BENEFIT PAYMENTS FOR UNFUNDED PLANS IN ALL YEARS.

(5)   MINIMUM COMMITMENTS FOR OPERATING

LEASES, SHOWN ON AN UNDISCOUNTED BASIS, COVER DRILLING EQUIPMENT, TANKERS,

SERVICE STATIONS AND OTHER PROPERTIES.

(6)   UNCONDITIONAL PURCHASE OBLIGATIONS

(UPOS) ARE THOSE LONG-TERM COMMITMENTS THAT ARE NONCANCELABLE OR CANCELABLE

ONLY UNDER CERTAIN CONDITIONS, AND THAT THIRD PARTIES HAVE USED TO SECURE

FINANCING FOR THE FACILITIES THAT WILL PROVIDE THE CONTRACTED GOODS OR

SERVICES. THE UNDISCOUNTED OBLIGATIONS OF $1,095 MILLION MAINLY PERTAIN TO

PIPELINE THROUGHPUT AGREEMENTS AND INCLUDE $433 MILLION OF OBLIGATIONS TO

EQUITY COMPANIES.

(7)   TAKE-OR-PAY OBLIGATIONS ARE

NONCANCELABLE, LONG-TERM COMMITMENTS FOR GOODS AND SERVICES OTHER THAN UPOS.

THE UNDISCOUNTED OBLIGATIONS OF $27,709 MILLION MAINLY PERTAIN TO PIPELINE,

MANUFACTURING SUPPLY AND TERMINAL AGREEMENTS.

(8)   FIRM COMMITMENTS RELATED TO CAPITAL

PROJECTS, SHOWN ON AN UNDISCOUNTED BASIS, TOTALED APPROXIMATELY $25.6 BILLION.

THESE COMMITMENTS WERE PRIMARILY ASSOCIATED WITH UPSTREAM PROJECTS OUTSIDE THE

U.S., OF WHICH $13.9 BILLION WAS ASSOCIATED WITH PROJECTS IN AFRICA, CANADA, AUSTRALIA,

UNITED ARAB EMIRATES, MALAYSIA AND KAZAKHSTAN. THE CORPORATION EXPECTS TO FUND

THE MAJORITY OF THESE PROJECTS WITH I

NTERNALLY GENERATED FUNDS, SUPPLEMENTED BY LONG-TERM AND

SHORT-TERM DEBT.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

GUARANTEES

THE

CORPORATION AND CERTAIN OF ITS CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES WERE CONTINGENTLY

LIABLE AT DECEMBER 31, 2014, FOR GUARANTEES RELATING TO NOTES, LOANS AND

PERFORMANCE UNDER CONTRACTS (NOTE 16). WHERE GUARANTEES FOR ENVIRONMENTAL

REMEDIATION AND OTHER SIMILAR MATTERS DO NOT INCLUDE A STATED CAP, THE AMOUNTS

REFLECT MANAGEMENT’S ESTIMATE OF THE MAXIMUM POTENTIAL EXPOSURE. THESE GUARANTEES

ARE NOT REASONABLY LIKELY TO HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE CORPORATION’S

FINANCIAL CONDITION, CHANGES IN FINANCIAL CONDITION, REVENUES OR EXPENSES,

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, LIQUIDITY, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES OR CAPITAL RESOURCES.

FINANCIAL STRENGTH

ON

DECEMBER 31, 2014, THE CORPORATION’S UNUSED SHORT-TERM COMMITTED LINES OF CREDIT

TOTALED APPROXIMATELY $6.3 BILLION (NOTE 6) AND UNUSED LONG-TERM COMMITTED LINES

OF CREDIT TOTALED APPROXIMATELY $0.5 BILLION (NOTE 14). THE TABLE BELOW SHOWS

THE CORPORATION’S FIXED-CHARGE COVERAGE AND CONSOLIDATED DEBT-TO-CAPITAL

MANAGEMENT

VIEWS THE CORPORATION’S FINANCIAL STRENGTH, AS EVIDENCED BY THE ABOVE FINANCIAL

RATIOS AND OTHER SIMILAR MEASURES, TO BE A COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE OF STRATEGIC

IMPORTANCE. THE CORPORATION’S SOUND FINANCIAL POSITION GIVES IT THE OPPORTUNITY

TO ACCESS THE WORLD’S CAPITAL MARKETS IN THE FULL RANGE OF MARKET CONDITIONS,

AND ENABLES THE CORPORATION TO TAKE ON LARGE, LONG-TERM CAPITAL COMMITMENTS IN

THE PURSUIT OF MAXIMIZING SHAREHOLDER VALUE.

LITIGATION AND OTHER CONTINGENCIES

AS

DISCUSSED IN NOTE 16, A VARIETY OF CLAIMS HAVE BEEN MADE AGAINST EXXONMOBIL AND

CERTAIN OF ITS CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES IN A NUMBER OF PENDING LAWSUITS. BASED

ON A CONSIDERATION OF ALL RELEVANT FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES, THE CORPORATION

DOES NOT BELIEVE THE ULTIMATE OUTCOME OF ANY CURRENTLY PENDING LAWSUIT AGAINST

EXXONMOBIL WILL HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT UPON THE CORPORATION’S

OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, OR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS TAKEN AS A WHOLE.

THERE ARE NO EVENTS OR UNCERTAINTIES BEYOND THOSE ALREADY INCLUDED IN REPORTED

FINANCIAL INFORMATION THAT WOULD INDICATE A MATERIAL CHANGE IN FUTURE OPERATING

RESULTS OR FINANCIAL CONDITION. REFER TO NOTE 16 FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND OTHER CONTINGENCIES.

CAPITAL

AND EXPLORATION EXPENDITURES IN 2014 WERE $38.5 BILLION, DOWN 9 PERCENT FROM

2013 DUE PRIMARILY TO THE ABSENCE OF THE $3.1 BILLION CELTIC EXPLORATION LTD.

ACQUISITION IN 2013. THE CORPORATION ANTICIPATES AN AVERAGE INVESTMENT PROFILE

OF ABOUT $34 BILLION PER YEAR FOR THE NEXT FEW YEARS. ACTUAL SPENDING COULD

VARY DEPENDING ON THE PROGRESS OF INDIVIDUAL PROJECTS AND PROPERTY

ACQUISITIONS.

UPSTREAM SPENDING OF $32.7 BILLION IN 2014 WAS DOWN 14

PERCENT FROM 2013, REFLECTING THE ABSENCE OF $4.2 BILLION OF PROPERTY

ACQUISITION COSTS IN 2013. INVESTMENTS IN 2014 INCLUDED PROJECTS IN THE U.S.

GULF OF MEXICO, U.S. ONSHORE DRILLING, EXPLORATION IN RUSSIA AND CONTINUED

PROGRESS ON WORLD-CLASS PROJECTS IN CANADA AND AUSTRALIA. THE MAJORITY OF

EXPENDITURES ARE ON DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS, WHICH TYPICALLY TAKE TWO TO FOUR

YEARS FROM THE TIME OF RECORDING PROVED UNDEVELOPED RESERVES TO THE START OF

PRODUCTION. THE PERCENTAGE OF PROVED DEVELOPED RESERVES WAS 65 PERCENT OF TOTAL

PROVED RESERVES AT YEAR-END 2014, AND HAS BEEN OVER 60 PERCENT FOR THE LAST TEN

YEARS, INDICATING THAT PROVED RESERVES ARE CONSISTENTLY MOVED FROM UNDEVELOPED

TO DEVELOPED STATUS.

CAPITAL INVESTMENTS IN THE DOWNSTREAM TOTALED $3.0 BILLION

IN 2014, AN INCREASE OF $0.6 BILLION FROM 2013, MAINLY REFLECTING HIGHER SPENDING

ON CRUDE OIL TRANSPORTATION INFRASTRUCTURE. THE CHEMICAL CAPITAL EXPENDITURES

OF $2.7 BILLION INCREASED $0.9 BILLION FROM 2013 WITH HIGHER INVESTMENTS IN THE

CURRENT AND DEFERRED, WAS $18.0 BILLION, $6.2 BILLION LOWER THAN 2013, AS A

RESULT OF A LOWER EFFECTIVE TAX RATE. THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE WAS 41 PERCENT

COMPARED TO 48 PERCENT IN THE PRIOR YEAR DUE PRIMARILY TO IMPACTS RELATED TO

THE CORPORATION’S ASSET MANAGEMENT PROGRAM AND FAVORABLE U.S. DEFERRED TAX

ITEMS. SALES-BASED AND ALL OTHER TAXES AND DUTIES OF $64.9 BILLION IN 2014

DECREASED $2.1 BILLION.

2013

INCOME,

SALES-BASED AND ALL OTHER TAXES AND DUTIES TOTALED $91.2 BILLION IN 2013, A

DECREASE OF $11.1 BILLION OR 11 PERCENT FROM 2012. INCOME TAX EXPENSE, BOTH

CURRENT AND DEFERRED, WAS $24.3 BILLION, $6.8 BILLION LOWER THAN 2012, WITH THE

IMPACT OF LOWER EARNINGS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE HIGHER EFFECTIVE TAX RATE. THE

EFFECTIVE TAX RATE WAS 48 PERCENT COMPARED TO 44 PERCENT IN THE PRIOR YEAR DUE

TO THE ABSENCE OF FAVORABLE TAX IMPACTS ON DIVESTMENTS. SALES-BASED AND ALL

OTHER TAXES AND DUTIES OF $67.0 BILLION IN 2013 DECREASED $4.3 BILLION

REFLECTING THE 2012 JAPAN RESTRUCTURING.

THROUGHOUT

EXXONMOBIL’S BUSINESSES, NEW AND ONGOING MEASURES ARE TAKEN TO PREVENT AND

MINIMIZE THE IMPACT OF OUR OPERATIONS ON AIR, WATER AND GROUND. THESE

INCLUDE A SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT IN REFINING INFRASTRUCTURE AND TECHNOLOGY TO

MANUFACTURE CLEAN FUELS, AS WELL AS PROJECTS TO MONITOR AND REDUCE

NITROGEN OXIDE, SULFUR OXIDE AND GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS, AND EXPENDITURES FOR

ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS. USING DEFINITIONS AND GUIDELINES ESTABLISHED BY

THE AMERICAN PETROLEUM INSTITUTE, EXXONMOBIL’S 2014 WORLDWIDE ENVIRONMENTAL

EXPENDITURES FOR ALL SUCH PREVENTATIVE AND REMEDIATION STEPS, INCLUDING

EXXONMOBIL’S SHARE OF EQUITY COMPANY EXPENDITURES, WERE ABOUT

$6.2 BILLION. THE TOTAL COST FOR SUCH ACTIVITIES IS EXPECTED TO

REMAIN IN THIS RANGE IN 2015 AND 2016 (WITH CAPITAL EXPENDITURES APPROXIMATELY

40 PERCENT OF THE TOTAL).

ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES

THE

CORPORATION ACCRUES ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES WHEN IT IS PROBABLE THAT

OBLIGATIONS HAVE BEEN INCURRED AND THE AMOUNTS CAN BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED.

THIS POLICY APPLIES TO ASSETS OR BUSINESSES CURRENTLY OWNED OR PREVIOUSLY

DISPOSED. EXXONMOBIL HAS ACCRUED LIABILITIES FOR PROBABLE ENVIRONMENTAL

REMEDIATION OBLIGATIONS AT VARIOUS SITES, INCLUDING MULTIPARTY SITES WHERE THE

U.S. ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY HAS IDENTIFIED EXXONMOBIL AS ONE OF THE

POTENTIALLY RESPONSIBLE PARTIES. THE INVOLVEMENT OF OTHER FINANCIALLY

RESPONSIBLE COMPANIES AT THESE MULTIPARTY SITES COULD MITIGATE EXXONMOBIL’S

ACTUAL JOINT AND SEVERAL LIABILITY EXPOSURE. AT PRESENT, NO INDIVIDUAL SITE IS

EXPECTED TO HAVE LOSSES MATERIAL TO EXXONMOBIL’S OPERATIONS OR FINANCIAL

CONDITION. CONSOLIDATED COMPANY PROVISIONS MADE IN 2014 FOR ENVIRONMENTAL

LIABILITIES WERE $780 MILLION ($321 MILLION IN 2013) AND THE BALANCE

SHEET REFLECTS ACCUMULATED LIABILITIES OF $1,066 MILLION AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2014, AND $773 MILLION AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2013.

CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES.

CRUDE

OIL, NATURAL GAS, PETROLEUM PRODUCT AND CHEMICAL PRICES HAVE FLUCTUATED IN

RESPONSE TO CHANGING MARKET FORCES. THE IMPACTS OF THESE PRICE FLUCTUATIONS ON

EARNINGS FROM UPSTREAM, DOWNSTREAM AND CHEMICAL OPERATIONS HAVE VARIED. IN THE

UPSTREAM, A $1 PER BARREL CHANGE IN THE WEIGHTED-AVERAGE REALIZED PRICE

OF OIL WOULD HAVE APPROXIMATELY A $350 MILLION ANNUAL AFTER-TAX EFFECT ON

UPSTREAM CONSOLIDATED PLUS EQUITY COMPANY EARNINGS. SIMILARLY, A $0.10 PER KCF

CHANGE IN THE WORLDWIDE AVERAGE GAS REALIZATION WOULD HAVE APPROXIMATELY A $175

MILLION ANNUAL AFTER-TAX EFFECT ON UPSTREAM CONSOLIDATED PLUS EQUITY COMPANY

EARNINGS. FOR ANY GIVEN PERIOD, THE EXTENT OF ACTUAL BENEFIT OR DETRIMENT WILL

BE DEPENDENT ON THE PRICE MOVEMENTS OF INDIVIDUAL TYPES OF CRUDE OIL, TAXES AND

OTHER GOVERNMENT TAKE IMPACTS, PRICE ADJUSTMENT LAGS IN LONG-TERM GAS

CONTRACTS, AND CRUDE AND GAS PRODUCTION VOLUMES. ACCORDINGLY, CHANGES IN

BENCHMARK PRICES FOR CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS ONLY PROVIDE BROAD INDICATORS OF

CHANGES IN THE EARNINGS EXPERIENCED IN ANY PARTICULAR PERIOD.

IN THE VERY COMPETITIVE DOWNSTREAM AND CHEMICAL

ENVIRONMENTS, EARNINGS ARE PRIMARILY DETERMINED BY MARGIN CAPTURE RATHER THAN

ABSOLUTE PRICE LEVELS OF PRODUCTS SOLD. REFINING MARGINS ARE A FUNCTION OF THE

DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WHAT A REFINER PAYS FOR ITS RAW MATERIALS (PRIMARILY CRUDE

OIL) AND THE MARKET PRICES FOR THE RANGE OF PRODUCTS PRODUCED. THESE PRICES IN

TURN DEPEND ON GLOBAL AND REGIONAL SUPPLY/DEMAND BALANCES, INVENTORY LEVELS,

REFINERY OPERATIONS, IMPORT/EXPORT BALANCES AND WEATHER.

54

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

THE GLOBAL ENERGY MARKETS CAN GIVE RISE TO EXTENDED PERIODS IN

WHICH MARKET CONDITIONS ARE ADVERSE TO ONE OR MORE OF THE CORPORATION’S

BUSINESSES. SUCH CONDITIONS, ALONG WITH THE CAPITAL-INTENSIVE NATURE OF THE

INDUSTRY AND VERY LONG LEAD TIMES ASSOCIATED WITH MANY OF OUR PROJECTS,

UNDERSCORE THE IMPORTANCE OF MAINTAINING A STRONG FINANCIAL POSITION.

MANAGEMENT VIEWS THE CORPORATION’S FINANCIAL STRENGTH AS A COMPETITIVE

ADVANTAGE.

IN GENERAL, SEGMENT RESULTS ARE NOT DEPENDENT ON THE

ABILITY TO SELL AND/OR PURCHASE PRODUCTS TO/FROM OTHER SEGMENTS. INSTEAD, WHERE

SUCH SALES TAKE PLACE, THEY ARE THE RESULT OF EFFICIENCIES AND COMPETITIVE

ADVANTAGES OF INTEGRATED REFINERY/CHEMICAL COMPLEXES. ADDITIONALLY,

INTERSEGMENT SALES ARE AT MARKET-BASED PRICES. THE PRODUCTS BOUGHT AND SOLD

BETWEEN SEGMENTS CAN ALSO BE ACQUIRED IN WORLDWIDE MARKETS THAT HAVE

SUBSTANTIAL LIQUIDITY, CAPACITY AND TRANSPORTATION CAPABILITIES. ABOUT 35

PERCENT OF THE CORPORATION’S INTERSEGMENT SALES REPRESENT UPSTREAM PRODUCTION

SOLD TO THE DOWNSTREAM. OTHER INTERSEGMENT SALES INCLUDE THOSE BETWEEN

REFINERIES AND CHEMICAL PLANTS RELATED TO RAW MATERIALS, FEEDSTOCKS AND

FINISHED PRODUCTS.

ALTHOUGH PRICE LEVELS OF CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS MAY RISE

OR FALL SIGNIFICANTLY OVER THE SHORT TO MEDIUM TERM DUE TO POLITICAL EVENTS,

OPEC ACTIONS AND OTHER FACTORS, INDUSTRY ECONOMICS OVER THE LONG TERM WILL

CONTINUE TO BE DRIVEN BY MARKET SUPPLY AND DEMAND. ACCORDINGLY, THE CORPORATION

EVALUATES THE VIABILITY OF ALL OF ITS INVESTMENTS OVER A BROAD RANGE OF FUTURE

PRICES. THE CORPORATION’S ASSESSMENT IS THAT ITS OPERATIONS WILL CONTINUE TO BE

SUCCESSFUL IN A VARIETY OF MARKET CONDITIONS. THIS IS THE OUTCOME OF

DISCIPLINED INVESTMENT AND ASSET MANAGEMENT PROGRAMS.

THE CORPORATION HAS AN ACTIVE ASSET MANAGEMENT PROGRAM IN

WHICH UNDERPERFORMING ASSETS ARE EITHER IMPROVED TO ACCEPTABLE LEVELS OR

CONSIDERED FOR DIVESTMENT. THE ASSET MANAGEMENT PROGRAM INCLUDES A DISCIPLINED,

REGULAR REVIEW TO ENSURE THAT ALL ASSETS ARE CONTRIBUTING TO THE CORPORATION’S

STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES. THE RESULT IS AN EFFICIENT CAPITAL BASE, AND THE

CORPORATION HAS SELDOM HAD TO WRITE DOWN THE CARRYING VALUE OF ASSETS, EVEN

DURING PERIODS OF LOW COMMODITY PRICES.

RISK MANAGEMENT

THE

CORPORATION’S SIZE, STRONG CAPITAL STRUCTURE, GEOGRAPHIC DIVERSITY AND THE

COMPLEMENTARY NATURE OF THE UPSTREAM, DOWNSTREAM AND CHEMICAL BUSINESSES REDUCE

THE CORPORATION’S ENTERPRISE-WIDE RISK FROM CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES, CURRENCY

RATES AND COMMODITY PRICES. AS A RESULT, THE CORPORATION MAKES LIMITED USE OF

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS TO MITIGATE THE IMPACT OF SUCH CHANGES. WITH RESPECT TO

DERIVATIVES ACTIVITIES, THE CORPORATION BELIEVES THAT THERE ARE NO MATERIAL

MARKET OR CREDIT RISKS TO THE CORPORATION’S FINANCIAL POSITION, RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS OR LIQUIDITY AS A RESULT OF THE DERIVATIVES DESCRIBED IN NOTE 13.

THE CORPORATION DOES NOT ENGAGE IN SPECULATIVE DERIVATIVE ACTIVITIES OR

DERIVATIVE TRADING ACTIVITIES NOR DOES IT USE DERIVATIVES WITH LEVERAGED

FEATURES. CREDIT RISK ASSOCIATED WITH THE CORPORATION’S DERIVATIVE POSITION IS

MITIGATED BY SEVERAL FACTORS, INCLUDING THE USE OF DERIVATIVE CLEARING EXCHANGES

AND THE QUALITY OF AND FINANCIAL LIMITS PLACED ON DERIVATIVE COUNTERPARTIES.

THE CORPORATION MAINTAINS A SYSTEM OF CONTROLS THAT INCLUDES THE AUTHORIZATION,

REPORTING AND MONITORING OF DERIVATIVE ACTIVITY.

THE CORPORATION IS EXPOSED TO CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES,

PRIMARILY ON ITS SHORT-TERM DEBT AND THE PORTION OF LONG-TERM DEBT THAT CARRIES

FLOATING INTEREST RATES. THE IMPACT OF A 100-BASIS-POINT CHANGE IN INTEREST

RATES AFFECTING THE CORPORATION’S DEBT WOULD NOT BE MATERIAL TO EARNINGS, CASH

FLOW OR FAIR VALUE. THE CORPORATION HAS ACCESS TO SIGNIFICANT CAPACITY OF

LONG-TERM AND SHORT-TERM LIQUIDITY. INTERNALLY GENERATED FUNDS ARE EXPECTED TO

COVER THE MAJORITY OF FINANCIAL REQUIREMENTS, SUPPLEMENTED BY LONG-TERM AND

SHORT-TERM DEBT. SOME JOINT-VENTURE PARTNERS ARE DEPENDENT ON THE CREDIT

MARKETS, AND THEIR FUNDING ABILITY MAY IMPACT THE DEVELOPMENT PACE OF

JOINT-VENTURE PROJECTS.

THE CORPORATION CONDUCTS BUSINESS IN MANY FOREIGN

CURRENCIES AND IS SUBJECT TO EXCHANGE RATE RISK ON CASH FLOWS RELATED TO SALES,

EXPENSES, FINANCING AND INVESTMENT TRANSACTIONS. THE IMPACTS OF FLUCTUATIONS IN

EXCHANGE RATES ON EXXONMOBIL’S GEOGRAPHICALLY AND FUNCTIONALLY DIVERSE

OPERATIONS ARE VARIED AND OFTEN OFFSETTING IN AMOUNT. THE CORPORATION MAKES

LIMITED USE OF CURRENCY EXCHANGE CONTRACTS TO MITIGATE THE IMPACT OF CHANGES IN

CURRENCY VALUES, AND EXPOSURES RELATED TO THE CORPORATION’S LIMITED USE OF THE

CURRENCY EXCHANGE CONTRACTS ARE NOT MATERIAL.

INFLATION AND OTHER UNCERTAINTIES

THE GENERAL

RATE OF INFLATION IN MANY MAJOR COUNTRIES OF OPERATION HAS REMAINED MODERATE

OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS, AND THE ASSOCIATED IMPACT ON NON-ENERGY COSTS HAS

GENERALLY BEEN MITIGATED BY COST REDUCTIONS FROM EFFICIENCY AND PRODUCTIVITY

IMPROVEMENTS. INCREASED DEMAND FOR CERTAIN SERVICES AND MATERIALS HAS RESULTED

IN HIGHER OPERATING AND CAPITAL COSTS IN RECENT YEARS. THE CORPORATION WORKS TO

MINIMIZE COSTS IN ALL COMMODITY PRICE ENVIRONMENTS THROUGH ITS ECONOMIES OF

SCALE IN GLOBAL PROCUREMENT AND ITS EFFICIENT PROJECT MANAGEMENT PRACTICES.

55

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

RECENTLY

ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

IN

MAY 2014, THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD ISSUED A NEW STANDARD,

REVENUE

FROM CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS

. THE STANDARD ESTABLISHES A SINGLE REVENUE

RECOGNITION MODEL FOR ALL CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS, ELIMINATES INDUSTRY

SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS, AND EXPANDS DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS. THE STANDARD IS

REQUIRED TO BE ADOPTED BEGINNING JANUARY 1, 2017. EXXONMOBIL IS EVALUATING THE

STANDARD AND ITS EFFECT ON THE CORPORATION’S FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

THE

CORPORATION’S ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL REPORTING FAIRLY REFLECT ITS

STRAIGHTFORWARD BUSINESS MODEL INVOLVING THE EXTRACTING, REFINING AND MARKETING

OF HYDROCARBONS AND HYDROCARBON-BASED PRODUCTS. THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS IN CONFORMITY WITH U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES

(GAAP) REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS THAT AFFECT THE

REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS, LIABILITIES, REVENUES AND EXPENSES AND THE

DISCLOSURE OF CONTINGENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. THE CORPORATION’S ACCOUNTING

POLICIES ARE SUMMARIZED IN NOTE 1.

OIL AND GAS RESERVES

EVALUATIONS

OF OIL AND GAS RESERVES ARE IMPORTANT TO THE EFFECTIVE MANAGEMENT OF UPSTREAM

ASSETS. THEY ARE AN INTEGRAL PART OF INVESTMENT DECISIONS ABOUT OIL AND GAS

PROPERTIES SUCH AS WHETHER DEVELOPMENT SHOULD PROCEED. OIL AND GAS RESERVE

QUANTITIES ARE ALSO USED AS THE BASIS TO CALCULATE UNIT-OF-PRODUCTION

DEPRECIATION RATES AND TO EVALUATE IMPAIRMENT.

OIL AND GAS RESERVES INCLUDE BOTH PROVED AND UNPROVED

RESERVES. PROVED OIL AND GAS RESERVES ARE THOSE QUANTITIES OF OIL AND GAS WHICH,

BY ANALYSIS OF GEOSCIENCE AND ENGINEERING DATA, CAN BE ESTIMATED WITH

REASONABLE CERTAINTY TO BE ECONOMICALLY PRODUCIBLE. UNPROVED RESERVES ARE THOSE

WITH LESS THAN REASONABLE CERTAINTY OF RECOVERABILITY AND INCLUDE PROBABLE

RESERVES. PROBABLE RESERVES ARE RESERVES THAT ARE MORE LIKELY TO BE RECOVERED

THAN NOT.

THE ESTIMATION OF PROVED RESERVES IS AN ONGOING PROCESS

BASED ON RIGOROUS TECHNICAL EVALUATIONS, COMMERCIAL AND MARKET ASSESSMENT, AND

DETAILED ANALYSIS OF WELL INFORMATION SUCH AS FLOW RATES AND RESERVOIR PRESSURE

DECLINES. THE ESTIMATION OF PROVED RESERVES IS CONTROLLED BY THE CORPORATION

THROUGH LONG-STANDING APPROVAL GUIDELINES. RESERVE CHANGES ARE MADE WITHIN A

WELL-ESTABLISHED, DISCIPLINED PROCESS DRIVEN BY SENIOR LEVEL GEOSCIENCE AND

ENGINEERING PROFESSIONALS, ASSISTED BY THE RESERVES TECHNICAL OVERSIGHT GROUP

WHICH HAS SIGNIFICANT TECHNICAL EXPERIENCE, CULMINATING IN REVIEWS WITH AND

APPROVAL BY SENIOR MANAGEMENT. NOTABLY, THE CORPORATION DOES NOT USE SPECIFIC QUANTITATIVE

RESERVE TARGETS TO DETERMINE COMPENSATION. KEY FEATURES OF THE RESERVE

ESTIMATION PROCESS ARE COVERED IN DISCLOSURE OF RESERVES IN ITEM 2.

ALTHOUGH THE CORPORATION IS REASONABLY CERTAIN THAT PROVED

RESERVES WILL BE PRODUCED, THE TIMING AND AMOUNT RECOVERED CAN BE AFFECTED BY A

NUMBER OF FACTORS INCLUDING COMPLETION OF DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS, RESERVOIR

PERFORMANCE, REGULATORY APPROVALS AND SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN LONG-TERM OIL AND

GAS PRICE LEVELS.

PROVED RESERVES CAN BE FURTHER SUBDIVIDED INTO DEVELOPED

AND UNDEVELOPED RESERVES. THE PERCENTAGE OF PROVED DEVELOPED RESERVES WAS 65

PERCENT OF TOTAL PROVED RESERVES AT YEAR-END 2014 (INCLUDING BOTH CONSOLIDATED

AND EQUITY COMPANY RESERVES), AND HAS BEEN OVER 60 PERCENT FOR THE LAST TEN

YEARS, INDICATING THAT PROVED RESERVES ARE CONSISTENTLY MOVED FROM UNDEVELOPED

TO DEVELOPED STATUS.

REVISIONS CAN INCLUDE UPWARD OR DOWNWARD CHANGES IN

PREVIOUSLY ESTIMATED VOLUMES OF PROVED RESERVES FOR EXISTING FIELDS DUE TO THE

EVALUATION OR RE-EVALUATION OF (1) ALREADY AVAILABLE GEOLOGIC, RESERVOIR

OR PRODUCTION DATA, (2) NEW GEOLOGIC, RESERVOIR OR PRODUCTION DATA OR

(3) CHANGES IN PRICES AND YEAR-END COSTS THAT ARE USED IN THE ESTIMATION

OF RESERVES. REVISIONS CAN ALSO RESULT FROM SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN DEVELOPMENT

STRATEGY OR PRODUCTION EQUIPMENT/FACILITY CAPACITY.

IMPACT

OF OIL AND GAS RESERVES ON DEPRECIATION.

THE CALCULATION OF UNIT-OF-PRODUCTION DEPRECIATION IS A CRITICAL

ACCOUNTING ESTIMATE THAT MEASURES THE DEPRECIATION OF UPSTREAM ASSETS. IT IS

THE RATIO OF ACTUAL VOLUMES PRODUCED TO TOTAL PROVED RESERVES OR PROVED

DEVELOPED RESERVES (THOSE PROVED RESERVES RECOVERABLE THROUGH EXISTING WELLS

WITH EXISTING EQUIPMENT AND OPERATING METHODS), APPLIED TO THE ASSET COST. THE

VOLUMES PRODUCED AND ASSET COST ARE KNOWN AND, WHILE PROVED RESERVES HAVE A

HIGH PROBABILITY OF RECOVERABILITY, THEY ARE BASED ON ESTIMATES THAT ARE

SUBJECT TO SOME VARIABILITY. WHILE THE REVISIONS THE CORPORATION HAS MADE IN

THE PAST ARE AN INDICATOR OF VARIABILITY, THEY HAVE HAD A VERY SMALL IMPACT ON

THE UNIT-OF-PRODUCTION RATES BECAUSE THEY HAVE BEEN SMALL COMPARED TO THE LARGE

RESERVES BASE.

IMPACT

OF OIL AND GAS RESERVES AND PRICES ON TESTING FOR IMPAIRMENT.

PROVED OIL AND GAS PROPERTIES HELD AND

USED BY THE CORPORATION ARE REVIEWED FOR IMPAIRMENT WHENEVER EVENTS OR

CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THAT THE CARRYING AMOUNTS MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE. ASSETS

ARE GROUPED AT THE LOWEST LEVEL FOR WHICH THERE ARE IDENTIFIABLE CASH FLOWS

THAT ARE LARGELY INDEPENDENT OF THE CASH FLOWS OF OTHER GROUPS OF ASSETS.

THE CORPORATION ESTIMATES THE FUTURE UNDISCOUNTED CASH

FLOWS OF THE AFFECTED PROPERTIES TO JUDGE THE RECOVERABILITY OF CARRYING

AMOUNTS. IMPAIRMENT ANALYSES ARE GENERALLY BASED ON PROVED RESERVES. WHERE

PROBABLE RESERVES EXIST, AN APPROPRIATELY RISK-

56

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

ADJUSTED

AMOUNT OF THESE RESERVES MAY BE INCLUDED IN THE IMPAIRMENT EVALUATION. AN ASSET

GROUP WOULD BE IMPAIRED IF ITS UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS WERE LESS THAN THE

ASSET’S CARRYING VALUE. IMPAIRMENTS ARE MEASURED BY THE AMOUNT BY WHICH THE

CARRYING VALUE EXCEEDS FAIR VALUE.

SIGNIFICANT UNPROVED PROPERTIES ARE ASSESSED FOR IMPAIRMENT

INDIVIDUALLY, AND VALUATION ALLOWANCES AGAINST THE CAPITALIZED COSTS ARE

RECORDED BASED ON THE ESTIMATED ECONOMIC CHANCE OF SUCCESS AND THE LENGTH OF

TIME THAT THE CORPORATION EXPECTS TO HOLD THE PROPERTIES. PROPERTIES THAT ARE

NOT INDIVIDUALLY SIGNIFICANT ARE AGGREGATED BY GROUPS AND AMORTIZED BASED ON

DEVELOPMENT RISK AND AVERAGE HOLDING PERIOD.

THE CORPORATION PERFORMS ASSET VALUATION ANALYSES ON AN

ONGOING BASIS AS A PART OF ITS ASSET MANAGEMENT PROGRAM. THESE ANALYSES ASSIST

THE CORPORATION IN ASSESSING WHETHER THE CARRYING AMOUNTS OF ANY OF ITS ASSETS

MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE. IN ADDITION TO ESTIMATING OIL AND GAS RESERVE VOLUMES

IN CONDUCTING THESE ANALYSES, IT IS ALSO NECESSARY TO ESTIMATE FUTURE OIL AND

GAS PRICES. POTENTIAL TRIGGER EVENTS FOR IMPAIRMENT EVALUATION INCLUDE A

SIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN CURRENT AND PROJECTED RESERVE VOLUMES, AN ACCUMULATION

OF PROJECT COSTS SIGNIFICANTLY IN EXCESS OF THE AMOUNT ORIGINALLY EXPECTED, AND

CURRENT PERIOD OPERATING LOSSES COMBINED WITH A HISTORY AND FORECAST OF OPERATING

OR CASH FLOW LOSSES.

IN GENERAL, THE CORPORATION DOES NOT VIEW TEMPORARILY LOW PRICES

OR MARGINS AS A TRIGGER EVENT FOR CONDUCTING THE IMPAIRMENT TESTS. THE MARKETS

FOR CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS HAVE A HISTORY OF SIGNIFICANT PRICE VOLATILITY.

ALTHOUGH PRICES WILL OCCASIONALLY DROP SIGNIFICANTLY, INDUSTRY PRICES OVER THE

LONG TERM WILL CONTINUE TO BE DRIVEN BY MARKET SUPPLY AND DEMAND. ON THE SUPPLY

SIDE, INDUSTRY PRODUCTION FROM MATURE FIELDS IS DECLINING, BUT THIS IS BEING

OFFSET BY PRODUCTION FROM NEW DISCOVERIES AND FIELD DEVELOPMENTS. OPEC

PRODUCTION POLICIES ALSO HAVE AN IMPACT ON WORLD OIL SUPPLIES. THE DEMAND SIDE

IS LARGELY A FUNCTION OF GLOBAL ECONOMIC GROWTH. THE RELATIVE GROWTH/DECLINE IN

SUPPLY VERSUS DEMAND WILL DETERMINE INDUSTRY PRICES OVER THE LONG TERM, AND

THESE CANNOT BE ACCURATELY PREDICTED.

ACCORDINGLY, ANY IMPAIRMENT TESTS THAT THE CORPORATION

PERFORMS MAKE USE OF THE CORPORATION’S PRICE ASSUMPTIONS DEVELOPED IN THE

ANNUAL PLANNING AND BUDGETING PROCESS FOR THE CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS

MARKETS, PETROLEUM PRODUCTS AND CHEMICALS. THESE ARE THE SAME PRICE ASSUMPTIONS

THAT ARE USED FOR CAPITAL INVESTMENT DECISIONS. VOLUMES ARE BASED ON FIELD

PRODUCTION PROFILES, WHICH ARE UPDATED ANNUALLY. CASH FLOW ESTIMATES FOR IMPAIRMENT

TESTING EXCLUDE THE EFFECTS OF DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS.

SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION REGARDING OIL AND GAS RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS, CAPITALIZED COSTS AND RESERVES IS PROVIDED FOLLOWING THE NOTES TO

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. FUTURE PRICES USED FOR ANY IMPAIRMENT TESTS

WILL VARY FROM THE ONES USED IN THE SUPPLEMENTAL OIL AND GAS DISCLOSURE AND

COULD BE LOWER OR HIGHER FOR ANY GIVEN YEAR.

ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS

THE

CORPORATION INCURS RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS FOR CERTAIN ASSETS. THE FAIR VALUES

OF THESE OBLIGATIONS ARE RECORDED AS LIABILITIES ON A DISCOUNTED BASIS, WHICH

IS TYPICALLY AT THE TIME THE ASSETS ARE INSTALLED. IN THE ESTIMATION OF FAIR

VALUE, THE CORPORATION USES ASSUMPTIONS AND JUDGMENTS REGARDING SUCH FACTORS AS

THE EXISTENCE OF A LEGAL OBLIGATION FOR AN ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATION;

TECHNICAL ASSESSMENTS OF THE ASSETS; ESTIMATED AMOUNTS AND TIMING OF

SETTLEMENTS; DISCOUNT RATES; AND INFLATION RATES. ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS

ARE DISCLOSED IN NOTE 9 TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

SUSPENDED EXPLORATORY WELL COSTS

THE

CORPORATION CONTINUES CAPITALIZATION OF EXPLORATORY WELL COSTS WHEN THE WELL

HAS FOUND A SUFFICIENT QUANTITY OF RESERVES TO JUSTIFY ITS COMPLETION AS A

PRODUCING WELL AND THE CORPORATION IS MAKING SUFFICIENT PROGRESS ASSESSING THE

RESERVES AND THE ECONOMIC AND OPERATING VIABILITY OF THE PROJECT. EXPLORATORY

WELL COSTS NOT MEETING THESE CRITERIA ARE CHARGED TO EXPENSE. THE FACTS AND

CIRCUMSTANCES THAT SUPPORT CONTINUED CAPITALIZATION OF SUSPENDED WELLS AT YEAR-END

ARE DISCLOSED IN NOTE 10 TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

CONSOLIDATIONS

THE

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDE THE ACCOUNTS OF THOSE SUBSIDIARIES

THAT THE CORPORATION CONTROLS. THEY ALSO INCLUDE THE CORPORATION’S SHARE OF THE

UNDIVIDED INTEREST IN CERTAIN UPSTREAM ASSETS, LIABILITIES, REVENUES AND

EXPENSES. AMOUNTS REPRESENTING THE CORPORATION’S INTEREST IN THE UNDERLYING NET

ASSETS OF OTHER SIGNIFICANT ENTITIES THAT IT DOES NOT CONTROL, BUT OVER WHICH

IT EXERCISES SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE, ARE ACCOUNTED FOR USING THE EQUITY METHOD

OF ACCOUNTING.

INVESTMENTS IN COMPANIES THAT ARE PARTIALLY OWNED BY THE

CORPORATION ARE INTEGRAL TO THE CORPORATION’S OPERATIONS. IN SOME CASES THEY

SERVE TO BALANCE WORLDWIDE RISKS, AND IN OTHERS THEY PROVIDE THE ONLY AVAILABLE

MEANS OF ENTRY INTO A PARTICULAR MARKET OR AREA OF INTEREST. THE OTHER PARTIES

WHO ALSO HAVE AN EQUITY INTEREST IN THESE COMPANIES ARE EITHER INDEPENDENT

THIRD PARTIES OR HOST GOVERNMENTS THAT SHARE IN THE BUSINESS RESULTS ACCORDING

TO THEIR OWNERSHIP. THE CORPORATION DOES NOT INVEST IN THESE COMPANIES IN ORDER

TO REMOVE LIABILITIES FROM ITS BALANCE SHEET. IN FACT, THE CORPORATION HAS LONG

BEEN ON RECORD SUPPORTING AN

57

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

ALTERNATIVE ACCOUNTING

METHOD THAT WOULD REQUIRE EACH INVESTOR TO CONSOLIDATE ITS SHARE OF ALL ASSETS

AND LIABILITIES IN THESE PARTIALLY-OWNED COMPANIES RATHER THAN ONLY ITS INTEREST

IN NET EQUITY. THIS METHOD OF ACCOUNTING FOR INVESTMENTS IN PARTIALLY-OWNED

COMPANIES IS NOT PERMITTED BY U.S. GAAP EXCEPT WHERE THE INVESTMENTS ARE IN THE

DIRECT OWNERSHIP OF A SHARE OF UPSTREAM ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. HOWEVER, FOR

PURPOSES OF CALCULATING RETURN ON AVERAGE CAPITAL EMPLOYED, WHICH IS NOT

COVERED BY U.S. GAAP STANDARDS, THE CORPORATION INCLUDES ITS SHARE OF DEBT OF

THESE PARTIALLY-OWNED COMPANIES IN THE DETERMINATION OF AVERAGE CAPITAL

EMPLOYED.

PENSION BENEFITS

THE

CORPORATION AND ITS AFFILIATES SPONSOR ABOUT 100 DEFINED BENEFIT (PENSION)

PLANS IN OVER 40 COUNTRIES. THE PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS FOOTNOTE

(NOTE 17) PROVIDES DETAILS ON PENSION OBLIGATIONS, FUND ASSETS AND PENSION

EXPENSE.

SOME OF THESE PLANS (PRIMARILY NON-U.S.) PROVIDE PENSION

BENEFITS THAT ARE PAID DIRECTLY BY THEIR SPONSORING AFFILIATES OUT OF CORPORATE

CASH FLOW RATHER THAN A SEPARATE PENSION FUND. BOOK RESERVES ARE ESTABLISHED

FOR THESE PLANS BECAUSE TAX CONVENTIONS AND REGULATORY PRACTICES DO NOT

ENCOURAGE ADVANCE FUNDING. THE PORTION OF THE PENSION COST ATTRIBUTABLE TO EMPLOYEE

SERVICE IS EXPENSED AS SERVICES ARE RENDERED. THE PORTION ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE

INCREASE IN PENSION OBLIGATIONS DUE TO THE PASSAGE OF TIME IS EXPENSED OVER THE

TERM OF THE OBLIGATIONS, WHICH ENDS WHEN ALL BENEFITS ARE PAID. THE PRIMARY

DIFFERENCE IN PENSION EXPENSE FOR UNFUNDED VERSUS FUNDED PLANS IS THAT PENSION

EXPENSE FOR FUNDED PLANS ALSO INCLUDES A CREDIT FOR THE EXPECTED LONG-TERM

RETURN ON FUND ASSETS.

FOR FUNDED PLANS, INCLUDING THOSE IN THE U.S., PENSION

OBLIGATIONS ARE FINANCED IN ADVANCE THROUGH SEGREGATED ASSETS OR INSURANCE

ARRANGEMENTS. THESE PLANS ARE MANAGED IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE REQUIREMENTS OF

GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORITIES AND MEET OR EXCEED REQUIRED FUNDING LEVELS AS MEASURED

BY RELEVANT ACTUARIAL AND GOVERNMENT STANDARDS AT THE MANDATED MEASUREMENT

DATES. IN DETERMINING LIABILITIES AND REQUIRED CONTRIBUTIONS, THESE STANDARDS

OFTEN REQUIRE APPROACHES AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT DIFFER FROM THOSE USED FOR

ACCOUNTING PURPOSES.

THE CORPORATION WILL CONTINUE TO MAKE CONTRIBUTIONS TO

THESE FUNDED PLANS AS NECESSARY. ALL DEFINED-BENEFIT PENSION OBLIGATIONS,

REGARDLESS OF THE FUNDING STATUS OF THE UNDERLYING PLANS, ARE FULLY SUPPORTED

BY THE FINANCIAL STRENGTH OF THE CORPORATION OR THE RESPECTIVE SPONSORING

AFFILIATE.

PENSION ACCOUNTING REQUIRES EXPLICIT ASSUMPTIONS REGARDING,

AMONG OTHERS, THE LONG-TERM EXPECTED EARNINGS RATE ON FUND ASSETS, THE DISCOUNT

RATE FOR THE BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS AND THE LONG-TERM RATE FOR FUTURE SALARY

INCREASES. PENSION ASSUMPTIONS ARE REVIEWED ANNUALLY BY OUTSIDE ACTUARIES AND

SENIOR MANAGEMENT. THESE ASSUMPTIONS ARE ADJUSTED AS APPROPRIATE TO REFLECT

CHANGES IN MARKET RATES AND OUTLOOK. THE LONG-TERM EXPECTED EARNINGS RATE ON

U.S. PENSION PLAN ASSETS IN 2014 WAS 7.25 PERCENT. THE 10‐YEAR AND 20‐YEAR

ACTUAL RETURNS ON U.S. PENSION PLAN ASSETS WERE 7 PERCENT AND 10 PERCENT,

RESPECTIVELY. THE CORPORATION ESTABLISHES THE LONG-TERM EXPECTED RATE OF RETURN

BY DEVELOPING A FORWARD-LOOKING, LONG-TERM RETURN ASSUMPTION FOR EACH PENSION

FUND ASSET CLASS, TAKING INTO ACCOUNT FACTORS SUCH AS THE EXPECTED REAL RETURN

FOR THE SPECIFIC ASSET CLASS AND INFLATION. A SINGLE, LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN

IS THEN CALCULATED AS THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE OF THE TARGET ASSET ALLOCATION

PERCENTAGES AND THE LONG-TERM RETURN ASSUMPTION FOR EACH ASSET CLASS. A

WORLDWIDE REDUCTION OF 0.5 PERCENT IN THE LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN ON ASSETS

WOULD INCREASE ANNUAL PENSION EXPENSE BY APPROXIMATELY $170 MILLION BEFORE TAX.

DIFFERENCES BETWEEN ACTUAL RETURNS ON FUND ASSETS AND THE

LONG-TERM EXPECTED RETURN ARE NOT RECOGNIZED IN PENSION EXPENSE IN THE YEAR

THAT THE DIFFERENCE OCCURS. SUCH DIFFERENCES ARE DEFERRED, ALONG WITH OTHER

ACTUARIAL GAINS AND LOSSES, AND ARE AMORTIZED INTO PENSION EXPENSE OVER THE

EXPECTED REMAINING SERVICE LIFE OF EMPLOYEES.

LITIGATION CONTINGENCIES

A

VARIETY OF CLAIMS HAVE BEEN MADE AGAINST THE CORPORATION AND CERTAIN OF ITS

CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES IN A NUMBER OF PENDING LAWSUITS. MANAGEMENT HAS

REGULAR LITIGATION REVIEWS, INCLUDING UPDATES FROM CORPORATE AND OUTSIDE

COUNSEL, TO ASSESS THE NEED FOR ACCOUNTING RECOGNITION OR DISCLOSURE OF THESE

CONTINGENCIES. THE STATUS OF SIGNIFICANT CLAIMS IS SUMMARIZED IN NOTE 16.

THE CORPORATION ACCRUES AN UNDISCOUNTED LIABILITY FOR THOSE

CONTINGENCIES WHERE THE INCURRENCE OF A LOSS IS PROBABLE, AND THE AMOUNT CAN BE

REASONABLY ESTIMATED. THESE AMOUNTS ARE NOT REDUCED BY AMOUNTS THAT MAY BE

RECOVERED UNDER INSURANCE OR CLAIMS AGAINST THIRD PARTIES, BUT UNDISCOUNTED

RECEIVABLES FROM INSURERS OR OTHER THIRD PARTIES MAY BE ACCRUED SEPARATELY. THE

CORPORATION REVISES SUCH ACCRUALS IN LIGHT OF NEW INFORMATION. FOR

CONTINGENCIES WHERE AN UNFAVORABLE OUTCOME IS REASONABLY POSSIBLE AND WHICH ARE

SIGNIFICANT, THE CORPORATION DISCLOSES THE NATURE OF THE CONTINGENCY AND, WHERE

FEASIBLE, AN ESTIMATE OF THE POSSIBLE LOSS. FOR PURPOSES OF OUR LITIGATION

CONTINGENCY DISCLOSURES, “SIGNIFICANT” INCLUDES MATERIAL MATTERS AS WELL AS

OTHER ITEMS WHICH MANAGEMENT BELIEVES SHOULD BE DISCLOSED.

MANAGEMENT JUDGMENT IS REQUIRED RELATED TO CONTINGENT

LIABILITIES AND THE OUTCOME OF LITIGATION BECAUSE BOTH ARE DIFFICULT TO PREDICT.

HOWEVER, THE CORPORATION HAS BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN DEFENDING LITIGATION IN THE

PAST. PAYMENTS HAVE NOT HAD A MATERIAL

58

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

ADVERSE EFFECT

ON OPERATIONS OR FINANCIAL CONDITION. IN THE CORPORATION’S EXPERIENCE, LARGE

CLAIMS OFTEN DO NOT RESULT IN LARGE AWARDS. LARGE AWARDS ARE OFTEN REVERSED OR

SUBSTANTIALLY REDUCED AS A RESULT OF APPEAL OR SETTLEMENT.

TAX CONTINGENCIES

THE

CORPORATION IS SUBJECT TO INCOME TAXATION IN MANY JURISDICTIONS AROUND THE

WORLD. SIGNIFICANT MANAGEMENT JUDGMENT IS REQUIRED IN THE ACCOUNTING FOR INCOME

TAX CONTINGENCIES AND TAX DISPUTES BECAUSE THE OUTCOMES ARE OFTEN DIFFICULT TO

PREDICT.

THE BENEFITS OF

UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS THAT THE CORPORATION HAS TAKEN OR EXPECTS TO TAKE IN

ITS INCOME TAX RETURNS ARE RECOGNIZED IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IF MANAGEMENT

CONCLUDES THAT IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT THE POSITION WILL BE SUSTAINED

WITH THE TAX AUTHORITIES. FOR A POSITION THAT IS LIKELY TO BE SUSTAINED, THE

BENEFIT RECOGNIZED IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IS MEASURED AT THE LARGEST

AMOUNT THAT IS GREATER THAN 50 PERCENT LIKELY OF BEING REALIZED. A RESERVE IS

ESTABLISHED FOR THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A POSITION TAKEN OR EXPECTED TO BE TAKEN

IN AN INCOME TAX RETURN AND THE AMOUNT RECOGNIZED IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

THE CORPORATION’S UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS AND A DESCRIPTION OF OPEN TAX YEARS

ARE SUMMARIZED IN NOTE 19.

FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION

THE

METHOD OF TRANSLATING THE FOREIGN CURRENCY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF THE

CORPORATION’S INTERNATIONAL SUBSIDIARIES INTO U.S. DOLLARS IS PRESCRIBED BY

GAAP. UNDER THESE PRINCIPLES, IT IS NECESSARY TO SELECT THE FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY

OF THESE SUBSIDIARIES. THE FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY IS THE CURRENCY OF THE PRIMARY

ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH THE SUBSIDIARY OPERATES. MANAGEMENT SELECTS THE

FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY AFTER EVALUATING THIS ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT.

FACTORS CONSIDERED BY MANAGEMENT WHEN DETERMINING THE

FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY FOR A SUBSIDIARY INCLUDE THE CURRENCY USED FOR CASH FLOWS

RELATED TO INDIVIDUAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES; THE RESPONSIVENESS OF SALES

PRICES TO CHANGES IN EXCHANGE RATES; THE HISTORY OF INFLATION IN THE COUNTRY;

WHETHER SALES ARE INTO LOCAL MARKETS OR EXPORTED; THE CURRENCY USED TO ACQUIRE

RAW MATERIALS, LABOR, SERVICES AND SUPPLIES; SOURCES OF FINANCING; AND

SIGNIFICANCE OF INTERCOMPANY TRANSACTIONS.

MANAGEMENT’S

REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

MANAGEMENT, INCLUDING THE

CORPORATION’S CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, PRINCIPAL FINANCIAL OFFICER, AND PRINCIPAL

ACCOUNTING OFFICER, IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ESTABLISHING AND MAINTAINING ADEQUATE

INTERNAL CONTROL OVER THE CORPORATION’S FINANCIAL REPORTING. MANAGEMENT

CONDUCTED AN EVALUATION OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL

REPORTING BASED ON CRITERIA ESTABLISHED IN

INTERNAL CONTROL –

INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK (2013)

ISSUED BY THE COMMITTEE OF SPONSORING

ORGANIZATIONS OF THE TREADWAY COMMISSION. BASED ON THIS EVALUATION, MANAGEMENT

CONCLUDED THAT EXXON MOBIL CORPORATION’S INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL

REPORTING WAS EFFECTIVE AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2014.

PRICEWATERHOUSECOOPERS LLP, AN INDEPENDENT REGISTERED

PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM, AUDITED THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE CORPORATION’S INTERNAL

CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2014, AS STATED IN

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

TO THE SHAREHOLDERS OF EXXON

MOBIL CORPORATION.

IN OUR OPINION, THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED BALANCE

SHEETS AND THE RELATED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME, COMPREHENSIVE INCOME,

CHANGES IN EQUITY AND CASH FLOWS PRESENT FAIRLY, IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS, THE

FINANCIAL POSITION OF EXXON MOBIL CORPORATION AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES AT

DECEMBER 31, 2014 AND 2013, AND THE RESULTS OF THEIR OPERATIONS AND THEIR

CASH FLOWS FOR EACH OF THE THREE YEARS IN THE PERIOD ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2014

IN CONFORMITY WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED

STATES OF AMERICA. ALSO IN OUR OPINION, THE CORPORATION MAINTAINED, IN ALL

MATERIAL RESPECTS, EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2014, BASED ON CRITERIA ESTABLISHED IN

INTERNAL CONTROL –

INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK (2013)

ISSUED BY THE COMMITTEE OF SPONSORING

ORGANIZATIONS OF THE TREADWAY COMMISSION (COSO). THE CORPORATION’S MANAGEMENT

IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, FOR MAINTAINING EFFECTIVE

INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AND FOR ITS ASSESSMENT OF THE

EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, INCLUDED IN THE

ACCOMPANYING MANAGEMENT’S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING.

OUR RESPONSIBILITY IS TO EXPRESS OPINIONS ON THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND ON

THE CORPORATION’S INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING BASED ON OUR

INTEGRATED AUDITS. WE CONDUCTED OUR AUDITS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE STANDARDS OF

THE PUBLIC COMPANY ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BOARD (UNITED STATES). THOSE STANDARDS

REQUIRE THAT WE PLAN AND PERFORM THE AUDITS TO OBTAIN REASONABLE ASSURANCE ABOUT

WHETHER THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE FREE OF MATERIAL MISSTATEMENT AND WHETHER

EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING WAS MAINTAINED IN ALL

MATERIAL RESPECTS. OUR AUDITS OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED EXAMINING,

ON A TEST BASIS, EVIDENCE SUPPORTING THE AMOUNTS AND DISCLOSURES IN THE

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, ASSESSING THE ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES USED AND SIGNIFICANT

ESTIMATES MADE BY MANAGEMENT, AND EVALUATING THE OVERALL FINANCIAL STATEMENT

PRESENTATION. OUR AUDIT OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING INCLUDED

OBTAINING AN UNDERSTANDING OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING,

ASSESSING THE RISK THAT A MATERIAL WEAKNESS EXISTS, AND TESTING AND EVALUATING

THE DESIGN AND OPERATING EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL CONTROL BASED ON THE ASSESSED

RISK. OUR AUDITS ALSO INCLUDED PERFORMING SUCH OTHER PROCEDURES AS WE

CONSIDERED NECESSARY IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR AUDITS PROVIDE A

REASONABLE BASIS FOR OUR OPINIONS.

A COMPANY’S INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING IS A

PROCESS DESIGNED TO PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING THE RELIABILITY OF

FINANCIAL REPORTING AND THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR EXTERNAL

PURPOSES IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES. A

COMPANY’S INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING INCLUDES THOSE POLICIES AND

PROCEDURES THAT (I) PERTAIN TO THE MAINTENANCE OF RECORDS THAT, IN

REASONABLE DETAIL, ACCURATELY AND FAIRLY REFLECT THE TRANSACTIONS AND

DISPOSITIONS OF THE ASSETS OF THE COMPANY; (II) PROVIDE REASONABLE

ASSURANCE THAT TRANSACTIONS ARE RECORDED AS NECESSARY TO PERMIT PREPARATION OF

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING

PRINCIPLES, AND THAT RECEIPTS AND EXPENDITURES OF THE COMPANY ARE BEING MADE

ONLY IN ACCORDANCE WITH AUTHORIZATIONS OF MANAGEMENT AND DIRECTORS OF THE

COMPANY; AND (III) PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING PREVENTION OR

TIMELY DETECTION OF UNAUTHORIZED ACQUISITION, USE, OR DISPOSITION OF THE

COMPANY’S ASSETS THAT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

BECAUSE OF ITS INHERENT LIMITATIONS, INTERNAL CONTROL OVER

FINANCIAL REPORTING MAY NOT PREVENT OR DETECT MISSTATEMENTS. ALSO, PROJECTIONS

OF ANY EVALUATION OF EFFECTIVENESS TO FUTURE PERIODS ARE SUBJECT TO THE RISK

THAT CONTROLS MAY BECOME INADEQUATE BECAUSE OF CHANGES IN CONDITIONS, OR THAT

THE DEGREE OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE POLICIES OR PROCEDURES MAY DETERIORATE.

THE

INFORMATION IN THE NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IS AN INTEGRAL

PART OF THESE STATEMENTS.

66

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS AND THE SUPPORTING AND SUPPLEMENTAL MATERIAL ARE THE RESPONSIBILITY

OF THE MANAGEMENT OF EXXON MOBIL CORPORATION.

THE CORPORATION’S PRINCIPAL BUSINESS IS ENERGY, INVOLVING

THE WORLDWIDE EXPLORATION, PRODUCTION, TRANSPORTATION AND SALE OF CRUDE OIL AND

NATURAL GAS (UPSTREAM) AND THE MANUFACTURE, TRANSPORTATION AND SALE OF

PETROLEUM PRODUCTS (DOWNSTREAM). THE CORPORATION IS ALSO A MAJOR WORLDWIDE

MANUFACTURER AND MARKETER OF PETROCHEMICALS (CHEMICAL).

THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN CONFORMITY WITH

U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES (GAAP) REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO

MAKE ESTIMATES THAT AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS, LIABILITIES,

REVENUES AND EXPENSES AND THE DISCLOSURE OF CONTINGENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES.

ACTUAL RESULTS COULD DIFFER FROM THESE ESTIMATES. PRIOR YEARS’ DATA HAS BEEN

RECLASSIFIED IN CERTAIN CASES TO CONFORM TO THE 2014 PRESENTATION BASIS.

1. SUMMARY OF ACCOUNTING POLICIES

PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION.

THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

INCLUDE THE ACCOUNTS OF SUBSIDIARIES THE CORPORATION CONTROLS. THEY ALSO

INCLUDE THE CORPORATION’S SHARE OF THE UNDIVIDED INTEREST IN CERTAIN UPSTREAM

ASSETS, LIABILITIES, REVENUES AND EXPENSES.

AMOUNTS REPRESENTING THE CORPORATION’S INTEREST IN ENTITIES

THAT IT DOES NOT CONTROL, BUT OVER WHICH IT EXERCISES SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE,

ARE INCLUDED IN “INVESTMENTS, ADVANCES AND LONG-TERM RECEIVABLES.” THE

CORPORATION’S SHARE OF THE NET INCOME OF THESE COMPANIES IS INCLUDED IN THE

CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF INCOME CAPTION “INCOME FROM EQUITY AFFILIATES.”

MAJORITY OWNERSHIP IS NORMALLY THE INDICATOR OF CONTROL

THAT IS THE BASIS ON WHICH SUBSIDIARIES ARE CONSOLIDATED. HOWEVER, CERTAIN

FACTORS MAY INDICATE THAT A MAJORITY-OWNED INVESTMENT IS NOT CONTROLLED AND

THEREFORE SHOULD BE ACCOUNTED FOR USING THE EQUITY METHOD OF ACCOUNTING. THESE

FACTORS OCCUR WHERE THE MINORITY SHAREHOLDERS ARE GRANTED BY LAW OR BY CONTRACT

SUBSTANTIVE PARTICIPATING RIGHTS. THESE INCLUDE THE RIGHT TO APPROVE OPERATING

POLICIES, EXPENSE BUDGETS, FINANCING AND INVESTMENT PLANS, AND MANAGEMENT

COMPENSATION AND SUCCESSION PLANS.

THE CORPORATION’S SHARE OF THE CUMULATIVE FOREIGN EXCHANGE

TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENT FOR EQUITY METHOD INVESTMENTS IS REPORTED IN ACCUMULATED

OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME.

EVIDENCE OF LOSS IN VALUE THAT MIGHT INDICATE IMPAIRMENT OF

INVESTMENTS IN COMPANIES ACCOUNTED FOR ON THE EQUITY METHOD IS ASSESSED TO

DETERMINE IF SUCH EVIDENCE REPRESENTS A LOSS IN VALUE OF THE CORPORATION’S

INVESTMENT THAT IS OTHER THAN TEMPORARY. EXAMPLES OF KEY INDICATORS INCLUDE A

HISTORY OF OPERATING LOSSES, NEGATIVE EARNINGS AND CASH FLOW OUTLOOK,

SIGNIFICANT DOWNWARD REVISIONS TO OIL AND GAS RESERVES, AND THE FINANCIAL

CONDITION AND PROSPECTS FOR THE INVESTEE’S BUSINESS SEGMENT OR GEOGRAPHIC

REGION. IF EVIDENCE OF AN OTHER THAN TEMPORARY LOSS IN FAIR VALUE BELOW

CARRYING AMOUNT IS DETERMINED, AN IMPAIRMENT IS RECOGNIZED. IN THE ABSENCE OF

MARKET PRICES FOR THE INVESTMENT, DISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS ARE USED TO ASSESS FAIR

VALUE.

REVENUE RECOGNITION.

THE CORPORATION GENERALLY SELLS CRUDE OIL, NATURAL GAS AND

PETROLEUM AND CHEMICAL PRODUCTS UNDER SHORT-TERM AGREEMENTS AT PREVAILING

MARKET PRICES. IN SOME CASES (E.G., NATURAL GAS), PRODUCTS MAY BE SOLD UNDER

LONG-TERM AGREEMENTS, WITH PERIODIC PRICE ADJUSTMENTS. REVENUES ARE RECOGNIZED

WHEN THE PRODUCTS ARE DELIVERED, WHICH OCCURS WHEN THE CUSTOMER HAS TAKEN TITLE

AND HAS ASSUMED THE RISKS AND REWARDS OF OWNERSHIP, PRICES ARE FIXED OR

DETERMINABLE AND COLLECTIBILITY IS REASONABLY ASSURED.

REVENUES FROM THE PRODUCTION OF NATURAL GAS PROPERTIES IN

WHICH THE CORPORATION HAS AN INTEREST WITH OTHER PRODUCERS ARE RECOGNIZED ON

THE BASIS OF THE CORPORATION’S NET WORKING INTEREST. DIFFERENCES BETWEEN ACTUAL

PRODUCTION AND NET WORKING INTEREST VOLUMES ARE NOT SIGNIFICANT.

PURCHASES AND SALES OF INVENTORY WITH THE SAME COUNTERPARTY

THAT ARE ENTERED INTO IN CONTEMPLATION OF ONE ANOTHER ARE COMBINED AND RECORDED

AS EXCHANGES MEASURED AT THE BOOK VALUE OF THE ITEM SOLD.

SALES-BASED TAXES.

THE CORPORATION REPORTS SALES, EXCISE AND VALUE-ADDED TAXES ON

SALES TRANSACTIONS ON A GROSS BASIS IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF INCOME

(INCLUDED IN BOTH REVENUES AND COSTS).

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS.

THE CORPORATION MAKES LIMITED USE OF DERIVATIVE

INSTRUMENTS. THE CORPORATION DOES NOT ENGAGE IN SPECULATIVE DERIVATIVE

ACTIVITIES OR DERIVATIVE TRADING ACTIVITIES, NOR DOES IT USE DERIVATIVES WITH

LEVERAGED FEATURES. WHEN THE CORPORATION DOES ENTER INTO DERIVATIVE

TRANSACTIONS, IT IS TO OFFSET EXPOSURES ASSOCIATED WITH INTEREST RATES, FOREIGN

CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES AND HYDROCARBON PRICES THAT ARISE FROM EXISTING ASSETS,

LIABILITIES AND FORECASTED TRANSACTIONS.

THE GAINS AND LOSSES RESULTING FROM CHANGES IN THE FAIR

VALUE OF DERIVATIVES ARE RECORDED IN INCOME. IN SOME CASES, THE CORPORATION

DESIGNATES DERIVATIVES AS FAIR VALUE HEDGES, IN WHICH CASE THE GAINS AND LOSSES

ARE OFFSET IN INCOME BY THE GAINS AND LOSSES ARISING FROM CHANGES IN THE FAIR

VALUE OF THE UNDERLYING HEDGED ITEM.

FAIR VALUE.

FAIR VALUE IS THE PRICE THAT WOULD BE RECEIVED TO SELL AN ASSET OR

PAID TO TRANSFER A LIABILITY IN AN ORDERLY TRANSACTION BETWEEN MARKET

PARTICIPANTS. HIERARCHY LEVELS 1, 2 AND 3 ARE TERMS FOR THE PRIORITY OF INPUTS

TO VALUATION TECHNIQUES USED TO MEASURE FAIR VALUE. HIERARCHY LEVEL 1 INPUTS

ARE QUOTED PRICES IN ACTIVE MARKETS FOR IDENTICAL ASSETS OR LIABILITIES.

HIERARCHY

67

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

LEVEL 2 INPUTS ARE INPUTS OTHER THAN

QUOTED PRICES INCLUDED WITHIN LEVEL 1 THAT ARE DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY

OBSERVABLE FOR THE ASSET OR LIABILITY. HIERARCHY LEVEL 3 INPUTS ARE INPUTS

THAT ARE NOT OBSERVABLE IN THE MARKET.

INVENTORIES.

CRUDE OIL, PRODUCTS AND MERCHANDISE INVENTORIES ARE CARRIED AT THE

LOWER OF CURRENT MARKET VALUE OR COST (GENERALLY DETERMINED UNDER THE LAST-IN,

FIRST-OUT METHOD – LIFO). INVENTORY COSTS INCLUDE EXPENDITURES AND OTHER

CHARGES (INCLUDING DEPRECIATION) DIRECTLY AND INDIRECTLY INCURRED IN BRINGING

THE INVENTORY TO ITS EXISTING CONDITION AND LOCATION. SELLING EXPENSES AND

GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES ARE REPORTED AS PERIOD COSTS AND EXCLUDED

FROM INVENTORY COST. INVENTORIES OF MATERIALS AND SUPPLIES ARE VALUED AT COST

OR LESS.

PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT.

DEPRECIATION, DEPLETION AND AMORTIZATION,

BASED ON COST LESS ESTIMATED SALVAGE VALUE OF THE ASSET, ARE PRIMARILY

DETERMINED UNDER EITHER THE UNIT-OF-PRODUCTION METHOD OR THE STRAIGHT-LINE

METHOD, WHICH IS BASED ON ESTIMATED ASSET SERVICE LIFE TAKING OBSOLESCENCE INTO

CONSIDERATION. MAINTENANCE AND REPAIRS, INCLUDING PLANNED MAJOR MAINTENANCE,

ARE EXPENSED AS INCURRED. MAJOR RENEWALS AND IMPROVEMENTS ARE CAPITALIZED AND

THE ASSETS REPLACED ARE RETIRED.

THE CORPORATION USES THE “SUCCESSFUL EFFORTS” METHOD TO

ACCOUNT FOR ITS EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION ACTIVITIES. UNDER THIS METHOD, COSTS

ARE ACCUMULATED ON A FIELD-BY-FIELD BASIS. COSTS INCURRED TO PURCHASE, LEASE,

OR OTHERWISE ACQUIRE A PROPERTY (WHETHER UNPROVED OR PROVED) ARE CAPITALIZED

WHEN INCURRED. EXPLORATORY WELL COSTS ARE CARRIED AS AN ASSET WHEN THE WELL HAS

FOUND A SUFFICIENT QUANTITY OF RESERVES TO JUSTIFY ITS COMPLETION AS A

PRODUCING WELL AND WHERE THE CORPORATION IS MAKING SUFFICIENT PROGRESS

ASSESSING THE RESERVES AND THE ECONOMIC AND OPERATING VIABILITY OF THE PROJECT.

EXPLORATORY WELL COSTS NOT MEETING THESE CRITERIA ARE CHARGED TO EXPENSE. OTHER

EXPLORATORY EXPENDITURES, INCLUDING GEOPHYSICAL COSTS AND ANNUAL LEASE RENTALS,

ARE EXPENSED AS INCURRED. DEVELOPMENT COSTS INCLUDING COSTS OF PRODUCTIVE WELLS

AND DEVELOPMENT DRY HOLES ARE CAPITALIZED.

ACQUISITION COSTS OF PROVED PROPERTIES ARE AMORTIZED USING

A UNIT-OF-PRODUCTION METHOD, COMPUTED ON THE BASIS OF TOTAL PROVED OIL AND GAS

RESERVES. CAPITALIZED EXPLORATORY DRILLING AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS ASSOCIATED

WITH PRODUCTIVE DEPLETABLE EXTRACTIVE PROPERTIES ARE AMORTIZED USING

UNIT-OF-PRODUCTION RATES BASED ON THE AMOUNT OF PROVED DEVELOPED RESERVES OF

OIL, GAS AND OTHER MINERALS THAT ARE ESTIMATED TO BE RECOVERABLE FROM EXISTING

FACILITIES USING CURRENT OPERATING METHODS. UNDER THE UNIT-OF-PRODUCTION

METHOD, OIL AND GAS VOLUMES ARE CONSIDERED PRODUCED ONCE THEY HAVE BEEN

MEASURED THROUGH METERS AT CUSTODY TRANSFER OR SALES TRANSACTION POINTS AT THE

OUTLET VALVE ON THE LEASE OR FIELD STORAGE TANK.

PRODUCTION INVOLVES LIFTING THE OIL AND GAS TO THE SURFACE

AND GATHERING, TREATING, FIELD PROCESSING AND FIELD STORAGE OF THE OIL AND GAS.

THE PRODUCTION FUNCTION NORMALLY TERMINATES AT THE OUTLET VALVE ON THE LEASE OR

FIELD PRODUCTION STORAGE TANK. PRODUCTION COSTS ARE THOSE INCURRED TO OPERATE

AND MAINTAIN THE CORPORATION’S WELLS AND RELATED EQUIPMENT AND FACILITIES AND

ARE EXPENSED AS INCURRED. THEY BECOME PART OF THE COST OF OIL AND GAS PRODUCED.

THESE COSTS, SOMETIMES REFERRED TO AS LIFTING COSTS, INCLUDE SUCH ITEMS AS

LABOR COSTS TO OPERATE THE WELLS AND RELATED EQUIPMENT; REPAIR AND MAINTENANCE

COSTS ON THE WELLS AND EQUIPMENT; MATERIALS, SUPPLIES AND ENERGY COSTS REQUIRED

TO OPERATE THE WELLS AND RELATED EQUIPMENT; AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES RELATED

TO THE PRODUCTION ACTIVITY.

PROVED OIL AND GAS PROPERTIES HELD AND USED BY THE

CORPORATION ARE REVIEWED FOR IMPAIRMENT WHENEVER EVENTS OR CHANGES IN

CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THAT THE CARRYING AMOUNTS MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE. ASSETS

ARE GROUPED AT THE LOWEST LEVEL FOR WHICH THERE ARE IDENTIFIABLE CASH FLOWS

THAT ARE LARGELY INDEPENDENT OF THE CASH FLOWS OF OTHER GROUPS OF ASSETS.

THE CORPORATION ESTIMATES THE FUTURE UNDISCOUNTED CASH

FLOWS OF THE AFFECTED PROPERTIES TO JUDGE THE RECOVERABILITY OF CARRYING

AMOUNTS. CASH FLOWS USED IN IMPAIRMENT EVALUATIONS ARE DEVELOPED USING ANNUALLY

UPDATED CORPORATE PLAN INVESTMENT EVALUATION ASSUMPTIONS FOR CRUDE OIL AND

NATURAL GAS COMMODITY PRICES, REFINING AND CHEMICAL MARGINS AND FOREIGN

CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES. ANNUAL VOLUMES ARE BASED ON FIELD PRODUCTION PROFILES,

WHICH ARE ALSO UPDATED ANNUALLY. PRICES FOR OTHER PETROLEUM AND CHEMICAL PRODUCTS

ARE BASED ON CORPORATE PLAN ASSUMPTIONS DEVELOPED ANNUALLY BY MAJOR REGION AND

ALSO FOR INVESTMENT EVALUATION PURPOSES. CASH FLOW ESTIMATES FOR IMPAIRMENT

TESTING EXCLUDE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS.

IMPAIRMENT ANALYSES ARE GENERALLY BASED ON PROVED RESERVES.

WHERE PROBABLE RESERVES EXIST, AN APPROPRIATELY RISK-ADJUSTED AMOUNT OF THESE

RESERVES MAY BE INCLUDED IN THE IMPAIRMENT EVALUATION. AN ASSET GROUP WOULD BE

IMPAIRED IF THE UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS WERE LESS THAN ITS CARRYING VALUE. IMPAIRMENTS

ARE MEASURED BY THE AMOUNT THE CARRYING VALUE EXCEEDS FAIR VALUE.

SIGNIFICANT UNPROVED PROPERTIES ARE ASSESSED FOR IMPAIRMENT

INDIVIDUALLY, AND VALUATION ALLOWANCES AGAINST THE CAPITALIZED COSTS ARE

RECORDED BASED ON THE ESTIMATED ECONOMIC CHANCE OF SUCCESS AND THE LENGTH OF

TIME THAT THE CORPORATION EXPECTS TO HOLD THE PROPERTIES. PROPERTIES THAT ARE

NOT INDIVIDUALLY SIGNIFICANT ARE AGGREGATED BY GROUPS AND AMORTIZED BASED ON

DEVELOPMENT RISK AND AVERAGE HOLDING PERIOD. THE VALUATION ALLOWANCES ARE

REVIEWED AT LEAST ANNUALLY.

GAINS ON SALES OF PROVED AND UNPROVED PROPERTIES ARE ONLY

RECOGNIZED WHEN THERE IS NEITHER UNCERTAINTY ABOUT THE RECOVERY OF COSTS

APPLICABLE TO ANY INTEREST RETAINED NOR ANY SUBSTANTIAL OBLIGATION FOR FUTURE

PERFORMANCE BY THE CORPORATION.

LOSSES ON PROPERTIES SOLD ARE RECOGNIZED WHEN INCURRED OR

WHEN THE PROPERTIES ARE HELD FOR SALE AND THE FAIR VALUE OF THE PROPERTIES IS

LESS THAN THE CARRYING VALUE.

68

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

INTEREST COSTS INCURRED TO FINANCE

EXPENDITURES DURING THE CONSTRUCTION PHASE OF MULTIYEAR PROJECTS ARE

CAPITALIZED AS PART OF THE HISTORICAL COST OF ACQUIRING THE CONSTRUCTED ASSETS.

THE PROJECT CONSTRUCTION PHASE COMMENCES WITH THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE DETAILED

ENGINEERING DESIGN AND ENDS WHEN THE CONSTRUCTED ASSETS ARE READY FOR THEIR

INTENDED USE. CAPITALIZED INTEREST COSTS ARE INCLUDED IN PROPERTY, PLANT AND

EQUIPMENT AND ARE DEPRECIATED OVER THE SERVICE LIFE OF THE RELATED ASSETS.

ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS AND ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES.

THE CORPORATION

INCURS RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS FOR CERTAIN ASSETS. THE FAIR VALUES OF THESE

OBLIGATIONS ARE RECORDED AS LIABILITIES ON A DISCOUNTED BASIS, WHICH IS

TYPICALLY AT THE TIME THE ASSETS ARE INSTALLED. THE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THESE

LIABILITIES ARE CAPITALIZED AS PART OF THE RELATED ASSETS AND DEPRECIATED. OVER

TIME, THE LIABILITIES ARE ACCRETED FOR THE CHANGE IN THEIR PRESENT VALUE.

LIABILITIES FOR ENVIRONMENTAL COSTS ARE RECORDED WHEN IT IS

PROBABLE THAT OBLIGATIONS HAVE BEEN INCURRED AND THE AMOUNTS CAN BE REASONABLY

ESTIMATED. THESE LIABILITIES ARE NOT REDUCED BY POSSIBLE RECOVERIES FROM THIRD

PARTIES AND PROJECTED CASH EXPENDITURES ARE NOT DISCOUNTED.

FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION.

THE CORPORATION SELECTS THE FUNCTIONAL

REPORTING CURRENCY FOR ITS INTERNATIONAL SUBSIDIARIES BASED ON THE CURRENCY OF

THE PRIMARY ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH EACH SUBSIDIARY OPERATES.

DOWNSTREAM AND CHEMICAL OPERATIONS PRIMARILY USE THE LOCAL

CURRENCY. HOWEVER, THE U.S. DOLLAR IS USED IN COUNTRIES WITH A HISTORY OF HIGH

INFLATION (PRIMARILY IN LATIN AMERICA) AND SINGAPORE, WHICH PREDOMINANTLY SELLS

INTO THE U.S. DOLLAR EXPORT MARKET. UPSTREAM OPERATIONS WHICH ARE RELATIVELY

SELF-CONTAINED AND INTEGRATED WITHIN A PARTICULAR COUNTRY, SUCH AS CANADA, THE

UNITED KINGDOM, NORWAY AND CONTINENTAL EUROPE, USE THE LOCAL CURRENCY. SOME

UPSTREAM OPERATIONS, PRIMARILY IN ASIA AND AFRICA, USE THE U.S. DOLLAR BECAUSE

THEY PREDOMINANTLY SELL CRUDE AND NATURAL GAS PRODUCTION INTO U.S.

DOLLAR-DENOMINATED MARKETS.

FOR ALL OPERATIONS, GAINS OR LOSSES FROM REMEASURING

FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSACTIONS INTO THE FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY ARE INCLUDED IN

INCOME.

STOCK-BASED PAYMENTS.

THE CORPORATION AWARDS STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION TO

EMPLOYEES IN THE FORM OF RESTRICTED STOCK AND RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS.

COMPENSATION EXPENSE IS MEASURED BY THE PRICE OF THE STOCK AT THE DATE OF GRANT

AND IS RECOGNIZED IN INCOME OVER THE REQUISITE SERVICE PERIOD.

2. ACCOUNTING CHANGES

THE

CORPORATION DID NOT ADOPT AUTHORITATIVE GUIDANCE IN 2014 THAT HAD A MATERIAL

IMPACT ON THE CORPORATION’S FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

IN MAY 2014, THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD ISSUED A NEW

STANDARD,

REVENUE FROM CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS

. THE STANDARD

ESTABLISHES A SINGLE REVENUE RECOGNITION MODEL FOR ALL CONTRACTS WITH

CUSTOMERS, ELIMINATES INDUSTRY SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS, AND EXPANDS DISCLOSURE

REQUIREMENTS. THE STANDARD IS REQUIRED TO BE ADOPTED BEGINNING JANUARY 1, 2017.

EXXONMOBIL IS EVALUATING THE STANDARD AND ITS EFFECT ON THE CORPORATION’S

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

3. MISCELLANEOUS FINANCIAL INFORMATION

RESEARCH

AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES TOTALED $971 MILLION IN 2014, $1,044 MILLION IN 2013

5. CASH FLOW INFORMATION

THE

CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS PROVIDES INFORMATION ABOUT CHANGES IN CASH

AND CASH EQUIVALENTS. HIGHLY LIQUID INVESTMENTS WITH MATURITIES OF THREE MONTHS

OR LESS WHEN ACQUIRED ARE CLASSIFIED AS CASH EQUIVALENTS.

FOR 2014, THE “NET (GAIN) ON ASSET SALES” ON THE

CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS INCLUDES BEFORE-TAX GAINS FROM THE SALE OF

HONG KONG POWER OPERATIONS, ADDITIONAL PROCEEDS RELATED TO THE 2013 SALE OF A

PARTIAL INTEREST IN IRAQ, THE SALE OF DOWNSTREAM AFFILIATES IN THE CARIBBEAN

AND THE SALE OR EXCHANGE OF UPSTREAM PROPERTIES IN THE U.S., CANADA, AND

MALAYSIA. FOR 2013, THE AMOUNT INCLUDES BEFORE-TAX GAINS FROM THE SALE OF A

PARTIAL INTEREST IN IRAQ, THE SALE OF DOWNSTREAM AFFILIATES IN THE CARIBBEAN

AND THE SALE OF SERVICE STATIONS. FOR 2012, THE AMOUNT INCLUDES BEFORE-TAX

GAINS RELATED TO THE JAPAN RESTRUCTURING, THE SALE OF AN UPSTREAM PROPERTY IN

ANGOLA, EXCHANGES OF UPSTREAM PROPERTIES, THE SALE OF U.S. SERVICE STATIONS AND

THE SALE OF DOWNSTREAM AFFILIATES IN MALAYSIA AND SWITZERLAND. THESE GAINS ARE

REPORTED IN “OTHER INCOME” ON THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF INCOME.

IN 2014, EXXONMOBIL COMPLETED ASSET EXCHANGES, PRIMARILY

NON-CASH TRANSACTIONS, OF APPROXIMATELY $1.2 BILLION. THIS AMOUNT IS NOT

INCLUDED IN THE “SALES OF SUBSIDIARIES, INVESTMENTS, AND PROPERTY, PLANT AND

EQUIPMENT” OR THE “ADDITIONS TO PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT” LINES ON THE

STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS.

IN 2012, THE CORPORATION’S INTEREST IN A COST COMPANY WAS

REDEEMED. AS PART OF THE REDEMPTION, A VARIABLE NOTE DUE IN 2035 ISSUED BY

MOBIL SERVICES (BAHAMAS) LTD. WAS ASSIGNED TO A CONSOLIDATED EXXONMOBIL

AFFILIATE. THIS NOTE IS NO LONGER CLASSIFIED AS THIRD PARTY LONG-TERM DEBT.

THIS ASSIGNMENT DID NOT RESULT IN A “REDUCTION IN LONG-TERM DEBT” ON THE

STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS.

IN 2012, EXXONMOBIL COMPLETED ASSET EXCHANGES, PRIMARILY

NONCASH TRANSACTIONS, OF APPROXIMATELY $1 BILLION. THIS AMOUNT IS NOT INCLUDED

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

7. EQUITY COMPANY INFORMATION

THE

SUMMARIZED FINANCIAL INFORMATION BELOW INCLUDES AMOUNTS RELATED TO CERTAIN

LESS-THAN-MAJORITY-OWNED COMPANIES AND MAJORITY-OWNED SUBSIDIARIES WHERE

MINORITY SHAREHOLDERS POSSESS THE RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN SIGNIFICANT

MANAGEMENT DECISIONS (SEE NOTE 1). THESE COMPANIES ARE PRIMARILY ENGAGED IN OIL

AND GAS EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION, NATURAL GAS MARKETING, AND REFINING

OPERATIONS IN NORTH AMERICA; NATURAL GAS EXPLORATION, PRODUCTION AND

DISTRIBUTION, AND DOWNSTREAM OPERATIONS IN EUROPE; AND EXPLORATION, PRODUCTION,

LIQUEFIED NATURAL GAS (LNG) OPERATIONS, REFINING OPERATIONS, PETROCHEMICAL

MANUFACTURING, AND FUEL SALES IN ASIA. ALSO INCLUDED ARE SEVERAL REFINING,

PETROCHEMICAL MANUFACTURING, AND MARKETING VENTURES.

THE CORPORATION’S OWNERSHIP IN THESE VENTURES IS IN

THE FORM OF SHARES IN CORPORATE JOINT VENTURES AS WELL AS INTERESTS IN

PARTNERSHIPS. DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE COMPANY’S CARRYING VALUE OF AN EQUITY

INVESTMENT AND ITS UNDERLYING EQUITY IN THE NET ASSETS OF THE AFFILIATE ARE

ASSIGNED TO THE EXTENT PRACTICABLE TO SPECIFIC ASSETS AND LIABILITIES BASED ON

THE COMPANY’S ANALYSIS OF THE FACTORS GIVING RISE TO THE DIFFERENCE. THE

AMORTIZATION OF THIS DIFFERENCE, AS APPROPRIATE, IS INCLUDED IN “INCOME FROM

EQUITY AFFILIATES.”

THE SHARE OF TOTAL EQUITY COMPANY REVENUES FROM SALES

TO EXXONMOBIL CONSOLIDATED COMPANIES WAS 14 PERCENT, 13 PERCENT AND 16 PERCENT

IN THE YEARS 2014, 2013 AND 2012, RESPECTIVELY.

IN 2013 AND 2014, THE CORPORATION AND ROSNEFT ESTABLISHED

VARIOUS ENTITIES TO CONDUCT EXPLORATION AND RESEARCH ACTIVITIES. PERIODS OF

DISPROPORTIONATE FUNDING WILL RESULT IN THE CORPORATION RECOGNIZING, DURING THE

EARLY PHASES OF THE PROJECTS, AN INVESTMENT THAT IS LARGER THAN ITS EQUITY

SHARE IN THESE ENTITIES. THESE JOINT VENTURES ARE CONSIDERED VARIABLE INTEREST

ENTITIES. HOWEVER, SINCE THE CORPORATION IS NOT THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY OF

THESE ENTITIES, THE JOINT VENTURES ARE REPORTED AS EQUITY COMPANIES. IN 2014,

THE EUROPEAN UNION AND UNITED STATES IMPOSED SANCTIONS RELATING TO THE RUSSIAN

ENERGY SECTOR. IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE SANCTIONS AND ALL GENERAL AND SPECIFIC

LICENSES, PROHIBITED ACTIVITIES INVOLVING OFFSHORE RUSSIA IN THE BLACK SEA,

ARCTIC REGIONS, AND ONSHORE WESTERN SIBERIA HAVE BEEN WOUND DOWN. THE

CORPORATION'S MAXIMUM EXPOSURE TO LOSS FROM THESE JOINT VENTURES AS OF DECEMBER

31, 2014, IS $1.0 BILLION.

ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS

THE

CORPORATION INCURS RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS FOR CERTAIN ASSETS. THE FAIR VALUES

OF THESE OBLIGATIONS ARE RECORDED AS LIABILITIES ON A DISCOUNTED BASIS, WHICH

IS TYPICALLY AT THE TIME THE ASSETS ARE INSTALLED. IN THE ESTIMATION OF FAIR

VALUE, THE CORPORATION USES ASSUMPTIONS AND JUDGMENTS REGARDING SUCH FACTORS AS

THE EXISTENCE OF A LEGAL OBLIGATION FOR AN ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATION;

TECHNICAL ASSESSMENTS OF THE ASSETS; ESTIMATED AMOUNTS AND TIMING OF

SETTLEMENTS; DISCOUNT RATES; AND INFLATION RATES. ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS

INCURRED IN THE CURRENT PERIOD WERE LEVEL 3 FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS. THE COSTS

ASSOCIATED WITH THESE LIABILITIES ARE CAPITALIZED AS PART OF THE RELATED ASSETS

AND DEPRECIATED AS THE RESERVES ARE PRODUCED. OVER TIME, THE LIABILITIES ARE

ACCRETED FOR THE CHANGE IN THEIR PRESENT VALUE.

ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS FOR DOWNSTREAM AND CHEMICAL

FACILITIES GENERALLY BECOME FIRM AT THE TIME THE FACILITIES ARE PERMANENTLY

SHUT DOWN AND DISMANTLED. THESE OBLIGATIONS MAY INCLUDE THE COSTS OF ASSET

DISPOSAL AND ADDITIONAL SOIL REMEDIATION. HOWEVER, THESE SITES HAVE

INDETERMINATE LIVES BASED ON PLANS FOR CONTINUED OPERATIONS AND AS SUCH, THE

FAIR VALUE OF THE CONDITIONAL LEGAL OBLIGATIONS CANNOT BE MEASURED, SINCE IT IS

IMPOSSIBLE TO ESTIMATE THE FUTURE SETTLEMENT DATES OF SUCH OBLIGATIONS.

13. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND DERIVATIVES

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS.

THE FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

IS DETERMINED BY REFERENCE TO OBSERVABLE MARKET DATA AND OTHER VALUATION

TECHNIQUES AS APPROPRIATE. THE ONLY CATEGORY OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WHERE THE

DIFFERENCE BETWEEN FAIR VALUE AND RECORDED BOOK VALUE IS NOTABLE IS LONG-TERM

DEBT. THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF TOTAL LONG-TERM DEBT, EXCLUDING CAPITALIZED

LEASE OBLIGATIONS, WAS $11.7 BILLION AND $6.8 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2014, AND

2013, RESPECTIVELY, AS COMPARED TO RECORDED BOOK VALUES OF $11.3 BILLION AND $6.5

BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2014, AND 2013, RESPECTIVELY. THE INCREASE IN THE

ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE AND BOOK VALUE OF LONG-TERM DEBT REFLECTS THE

CORPORATION’S ISSUANCE OF $5,500 MILLION OF LONG-TERM DEBT IN THE FIRST QUARTER

OF 2014.

THE FAIR VALUE OF LONG-TERM DEBT BY

HIERARCHY LEVEL AT DECEMBER 31, 2014, IS: LEVEL 1 $11,036 MILLION; LEVEL 2 $561

MILLION; AND LEVEL 3 $63 MILLION.

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS.

THE CORPORATION’S SIZE, STRONG CAPITAL

STRUCTURE, GEOGRAPHIC DIVERSITY AND THE COMPLEMENTARY NATURE OF THE UPSTREAM,

DOWNSTREAM AND CHEMICAL BUSINESSES REDUCE THE CORPORATION’S ENTERPRISE-WIDE

RISK FROM CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES, CURRENCY RATES AND COMMODITY PRICES. AS A

RESULT, THE CORPORATION MAKES LIMITED USE OF DERIVATIVES TO MITIGATE THE IMPACT

OF SUCH CHANGES. THE CORPORATION DOES NOT ENGAGE IN SPECULATIVE DERIVATIVE

ACTIVITIES OR DERIVATIVE TRADING ACTIVITIES NOR DOES IT USE DERIVATIVES WITH

LEVERAGED FEATURES. WHEN THE CORPORATION DOES ENTER INTO DERIVATIVE

TRANSACTIONS, IT IS TO OFFSET EXPOSURES ASSOCIATED WITH INTEREST RATES, FOREIGN

CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES AND HYDROCARBON PRICES THAT ARISE FROM EXISTING ASSETS,

LIABILITIES AND FORECASTED TRANSACTIONS.

THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS

OUTSTANDING AND RECORDED ON THE BALANCE SHEET WAS A NET ASSET OF $75 MILLION AT

YEAR-END 2014 AND A NET ASSET OF $1 MILLION AT YEAR-END 2013. ASSETS AND

LIABILITIES ASSOCIATED WITH DERIVATIVES ARE USUALLY RECORDED EITHER IN “OTHER

CURRENT ASSETS” OR “ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND ACCRUED LIABILITIES.”

THE CORPORATION’S FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT OF ITS DERIVATIVE

INSTRUMENTS USE EITHER LEVEL 1 OR LEVEL 2 INPUTS.

THE CORPORATION RECOGNIZED A BEFORE-TAX GAIN OR (LOSS)

RELATED TO DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS OF $110 MILLION, $(7) MILLION AND $(23) MILLION

DURING 2014, 2013 AND 2012, RESPECTIVELY. INCOME STATEMENT EFFECTS ASSOCIATED

WITH DERIVATIVES ARE USUALLY RECORDED EITHER IN “SALES AND OTHER OPERATING

REVENUE” OR “CRUDE OIL AND PRODUCT PURCHASES.”

THE CORPORATION BELIEVES THERE ARE NO MATERIAL MARKET OR

CREDIT RISKS TO THE CORPORATION’S FINANCIAL POSITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR

LIQUIDITY AS A RESULT OF THE DERIVATIVE ACTIVITIES DESCRIBED ABOVE.

14. LONG-TERM DEBT

AT DECEMBER 31,

2014, LONG-TERM DEBT CONSISTED OF $11,341 MILLION DUE IN U.S. DOLLARS AND $312

MILLION REPRESENTING THE U.S. DOLLAR EQUIVALENT AT YEAR-END EXCHANGE RATES OF

AMOUNTS PAYABLE IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES. THESE AMOUNTS EXCLUDE THAT PORTION OF

LONG-TERM DEBT, TOTALING $770 MILLION, WHICH MATURES WITHIN ONE YEAR AND IS

INCLUDED IN CURRENT LIABILITIES. THE INCREASE IN THE BOOK VALUE OF LONG-TERM

DEBT REFLECTS THE CORPORATION’S ISSUANCE OF $5,500 MILLION OF LONG-TERM DEBT IN

THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2014. THE AMOUNTS OF LONG-TERM DEBT MATURING IN EACH OF

THE FOUR YEARS AFTER DECEMBER 31, 2015, IN MILLIONS OF DOLLARS, ARE: 2016

– $537; 2017 – $2,993; 2018 – $872; AND 2019 – $2,353.

AT DECEMBER 31, 2014, THE CORPORATION’S UNUSED LONG-TERM CREDIT LINES WERE $0.5

BILLION.

15. INCENTIVE PROGRAM

THE 2003 INCENTIVE PROGRAM PROVIDES FOR GRANTS OF STOCK

OPTIONS, STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS (SARS), RESTRICTED STOCK AND OTHER FORMS OF

AWARD. AWARDS MAY BE GRANTED TO ELIGIBLE EMPLOYEES OF THE CORPORATION AND THOSE

AFFILIATES AT LEAST 50 PERCENT OWNED. OUTSTANDING AWARDS ARE SUBJECT TO CERTAIN

FORFEITURE PROVISIONS CONTAINED IN THE PROGRAM OR AWARD INSTRUMENT. OPTIONS AND

SARS MAY BE GRANTED AT PRICES NOT LESS THAN 100 PERCENT OF MARKET VALUE ON THE

DATE OF GRANT AND HAVE A MAXIMUM LIFE OF 10 YEARS. THE MAXIMUM NUMBER OF SHARES

OF STOCK THAT MAY BE ISSUED UNDER THE 2003 INCENTIVE PROGRAM IS 220 MILLION.

AWARDS THAT ARE FORFEITED, EXPIRE OR ARE SETTLED IN CASH, DO NOT COUNT AGAINST

THIS MAXIMUM LIMIT. THE 2003 INCENTIVE PROGRAM DOES NOT HAVE A SPECIFIED TERM.

NEW AWARDS MAY BE MADE UNTIL THE AVAILABLE SHARES ARE DEPLETED, UNLESS THE

BOARD TERMINATES THE PLAN EARLY. AT THE END OF 2014, REMAINING SHARES AVAILABLE

FOR AWARD UNDER THE 2003 INCENTIVE PROGRAM WERE 108

MILLION.

RESTRICTED

STOCK AND RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS.

AWARDS TOTALING 9,775 THOUSAND, 9,729 THOUSAND, AND 10,017 THOUSAND

OF RESTRICTED (NONVESTED) COMMON STOCK AND RESTRICTED (NONVESTED) COMMON STOCK

UNITS WERE GRANTED IN 2014, 2013 AND 2012, RESPECTIVELY. COMPENSATION EXPENSE

FOR THESE AWARDS IS BASED ON THE PRICE OF THE STOCK AT THE DATE OF GRANT AND IS

RECOGNIZED IN INCOME OVER THE REQUISITE SERVICE PERIOD. SHARES FOR THESE AWARDS

ARE ISSUED TO EMPLOYEES FROM TREASURY STOCK. THE UNITS THAT ARE SETTLED IN CASH

ARE RECORDED AS LIABILITIES AND THEIR CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE ARE RECOGNIZED OVER

THE VESTING PERIOD. DURING THE APPLICABLE RESTRICTED PERIODS, THE SHARES AND

UNITS MAY NOT BE SOLD OR TRANSFERRED AND ARE SUBJECT TO FORFEITURE. THE

MAJORITY OF THE AWARDS HAVE GRADED VESTING PERIODS, WITH 50 PERCENT OF THE

SHARES AND UNITS IN EACH AWARD VESTING AFTER THREE YEARS AND THE REMAINING 50

PERCENT VESTING AFTER SEVEN YEARS. AWARDS GRANTED TO A SMALL NUMBER OF SENIOR

EXECUTIVES HAVE VESTING PERIODS OF FIVE YEARS FOR 50 PERCENT OF THE AWARD AND

OF 10 YEARS OR RETIREMENT, WHICHEVER OCCURS LATER, FOR THE REMAINING 50 PERCENT

OF THE AWARD.

THE CORPORATION HAS PURCHASED SHARES IN THE OPEN MARKET AND

THROUGH NEGOTIATED TRANSACTIONS TO OFFSET SHARES ISSUED IN CONJUNCTION WITH

BENEFIT PLANS AND PROGRAMS. PURCHASES MAY BE DISCONTINUED AT ANY TIME WITHOUT

PRIOR NOTICE.

16. LITIGATION AND OTHER CONTINGENCIES

LITIGATION.

A VARIETY OF CLAIMS HAVE

BEEN MADE AGAINST EXXONMOBIL AND CERTAIN OF ITS CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES IN A

NUMBER OF PENDING LAWSUITS. MANAGEMENT HAS REGULAR LITIGATION REVIEWS,

INCLUDING UPDATES FROM CORPORATE AND OUTSIDE COUNSEL, TO ASSESS THE NEED FOR

ACCOUNTING RECOGNITION OR DISCLOSURE OF THESE CONTINGENCIES. THE CORPORATION

ACCRUES AN UNDISCOUNTED LIABILITY FOR THOSE CONTINGENCIES WHERE THE INCURRENCE

OF A LOSS IS PROBABLE AND THE AMOUNT CAN BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED. IF A RANGE OF

AMOUNTS CAN BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED AND NO AMOUNT WITHIN THE RANGE IS A BETTER

ESTIMATE THAN ANY OTHER AMOUNT, THEN THE MINIMUM OF THE RANGE IS ACCRUED. THE

CORPORATION DOES NOT RECORD LIABILITIES WHEN THE LIKELIHOOD THAT THE LIABILITY

HAS BEEN INCURRED IS PROBABLE BUT THE AMOUNT CANNOT BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED OR

WHEN THE LIABILITY IS BELIEVED TO BE ONLY REASONABLY POSSIBLE OR REMOTE. FOR

CONTINGENCIES WHERE AN UNFAVORABLE OUTCOME IS REASONABLY POSSIBLE AND WHICH ARE

SIGNIFICANT, THE CORPORATION DISCLOSES THE NATURE OF THE CONTINGENCY AND, WHERE

FEASIBLE, AN ESTIMATE OF THE POSSIBLE LOSS. FOR PURPOSES OF OUR CONTINGENCY

DISCLOSURES, “SIGNIFICANT” INCLUDES MATERIAL MATTERS AS WELL AS OTHER MATTERS

WHICH MANAGEMENT BELIEVES SHOULD BE DISCLOSED. EXXONMOBIL WILL CONTINUE TO

DEFEND ITSELF VIGOROUSLY IN THESE MATTERS. BASED ON A CONSIDERATION OF ALL

RELEVANT FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES, THE CORPORATION DOES NOT BELIEVE THE ULTIMATE

OUTCOME OF ANY CURRENTLY PENDING LAWSUIT AGAINST EXXONMOBIL WILL HAVE A

MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT UPON THE CORPORATION’S OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL CONDITION,

OR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS TAKEN AS A WHOLE.

OTHER

CONTINGENCIES.

THE CORPORATION

AND CERTAIN OF ITS CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES WERE CONTINGENTLY LIABLE AT

DECEMBER 31, 2014, FOR GUARANTEES RELATING TO NOTES, LOANS AND

PERFORMANCE UNDER CONTRACTS. WHERE GUARANTEES FOR ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION AND

OTHER SIMILAR MATTERS DO NOT INCLUDE A STATED CAP, THE AMOUNTS REFLECT

MANAGEMENT’S ESTIMATE OF THE MAXIMUM POTENTIAL EXPOSURE.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

IN ACCORDANCE WITH A NATIONALIZATION

DECREE ISSUED BY VENEZUELA’S PRESIDENT IN FEBRUARY 2007, BY MAY 1, 2007, A

SUBSIDIARY OF THE VENEZUELAN NATIONAL OIL COMPANY (PDVSA) ASSUMED THE OPERATORSHIP

OF THE CERRO NEGRO HEAVY OIL PROJECT. THIS PROJECT HAD BEEN OPERATED AND OWNED

BY EXXONMOBIL AFFILIATES HOLDING A 41.67 PERCENT OWNERSHIP INTEREST IN THE

PROJECT. THE DECREE ALSO REQUIRED CONVERSION OF THE CERRO NEGRO PROJECT INTO A

“MIXED ENTERPRISE” AND AN INCREASE IN PDVSA’S OR ONE OF ITS AFFILIATE’S

OWNERSHIP INTEREST IN THE PROJECT, WITH THE STIPULATION THAT IF EXXONMOBIL

REFUSED TO ACCEPT THE TERMS FOR THE FORMATION OF THE MIXED ENTERPRISE WITHIN A

SPECIFIED PERIOD OF TIME, THE GOVERNMENT WOULD “DIRECTLY ASSUME THE ACTIVITIES”

CARRIED OUT BY THE JOINT VENTURE. EXXONMOBIL REFUSED TO ACCEDE TO THE TERMS

PROFFERED BY THE GOVERNMENT, AND ON JUNE 27, 2007, THE GOVERNMENT EXPROPRIATED

EXXONMOBIL’S 41.67 PERCENT INTEREST IN THE CERRO NEGRO PROJECT.

ON SEPTEMBER 6,

2007, AFFILIATES OF EXXONMOBIL FILED A REQUEST FOR ARBITRATION WITH THE

INTERNATIONAL CENTRE FOR SETTLEMENT OF INVESTMENT DISPUTES (ICSID) INVOKING

ICSID JURISDICTION UNDER VENEZUELA’S INVESTMENT LAW AND THE

NETHERLANDS-VENEZUELA BILATERAL INVESTMENT TREATY. THE ICSID TRIBUNAL ISSUED A

DECISION ON JUNE 10, 2010, FINDING THAT IT HAD JURISDICTION TO PROCEED ON THE

BASIS OF THE NETHERLANDS-VENEZUELA BILATERAL INVESTMENT TREATY. ON OCTOBER 9,

2014, THE ICSID TRIBUNAL ISSUED ITS FINAL AWARD FINDING IN FAVOR OF THE

EXXONMOBIL AFFILIATES AND AWARDING $1.6 BILLION AS OF THE DATE OF

EXPROPRIATION, JUNE 27, 2007, AND INTEREST FROM THAT DATE AT 3.25% COMPOUNDED

ANNUALLY UNTIL THE DATE OF PAYMENT IN FULL. THE TRIBUNAL ALSO NOTED THAT ONE OF

THE CERRO NEGRO PROJECT AGREEMENTS PROVIDES A MECHANISM TO PREVENT DOUBLE

RECOVERY BETWEEN THE ICSID AWARD AND ALL OR PART OF AN EARLIER AWARD OF $908

MILLION TO AN EXXONMOBIL AFFILIATE, MOBIL CERRO NEGRO, LTD., AGAINST PDVSA AND

A PDVSA AFFILIATE, PDVSA CN, IN AN ARBITRATION UNDER THE RULES OF THE

INTERNATIONAL CHAMBER OF COMMERCE (ICC).

FOLLOWING THE FAVORABLE ICSID DECISION IN THE FOURTH

QUARTER OF 2014, EXXONMOBIL RECOGNIZED EARNINGS OF $269 MILLION, NET OF THE

REMAINING ASSET VALUE, FOR THE PROCEEDS RECEIVED FROM THE EARLIER ICC AWARD.

JUDGMENT WAS

ENTERED ON THE ICSID AWARD BY THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN

DISTRICT OF NEW YORK ON OCTOBER 10, 2014. A MOTION TO VACATE THAT JUDGMENT ON

PROCEDURAL GROUNDS WAS FILED BY THE REPUBLIC OF VENEZUELA ON OCTOBER 14, 2014,

WHICH WAS DENIED BY THE COURT. THEREAFTER, THE REPUBLIC OF VENEZUELA FILED A

MOTION TO MODIFY THE JUDGMENT BY REDUCING THE RATE OF INTEREST TO BE PAID ON

THE ICSID AWARD FROM THE ENTRY OF THE COURT’S JUDGMENT, UNTIL THE DATE OF

PAYMENT.

ON OCTOBER 23,

2014, THE REPUBLIC OF VENEZUELA FILED WITH ICSID AN APPLICATION TO REVISE THE

ICSID AWARD SUCH THAT IT REQUIRES REPAYMENT OF THE VALUE OF THE ICC AWARD TO

PDVSA AT THE SAME TIME AS PAYMENT IS MADE TO THE EXXONMOBIL AFFILIATES FOR THE

ICSID AWARD AND THAT PROVISION BE MADE FOR INTEREST ON THE AMOUNT TO BE REPAID.

THEREAFTER, PURSUANT TO ICSID ARBITRATION RULES, THE ICSID AWARD WAS STAYED

PENDING FURTHER ACTION OF THE TRIBUNAL. ON OCTOBER 27, 2014,

EXXONMOBIL FILED A RESPONSE WITH ICSID THAT CONTESTS THE APPLICATION FOR

REVISION OF THAT AWARD ON BOTH FACTUAL AND JURISDICTIONAL GROUNDS. ON FEBRUARY

2, 2015, THE REPUBLIC OF VENEZUELA FILED AN APPLICATION TO ANNUL THE ICSID

AWARD. THE APPLICATION ALLEGES THAT, IN ISSUING THE ICSID AWARD, THE TRIBUNAL

EXCEEDED ITS POWERS, FAILED TO STATE REASONS ON WHICH THE ICSID AWARD WAS

BASED, AND DEPARTED FROM A FUNDAMENTAL RULE OF PROCEDURE. UPON REGISTRATION OF

THE APPLICATION WITH ICSID ON FEBRUARY 9, 2015, A FURTHER STAY OF THE ICSID

AWARD WAS ENTERED.

THE FEDERAL

COURT IN NEW YORK HAS STAYED ITS JUDGMENT UNTIL SUCH TIME AS THE STAYS OF THE

ICSID AWARD ENTERED FOLLOWING THE GOVERNMENT OF VENEZUELA’S FILING OF ITS TWO

APPLICATIONS HAVE BEEN LIFTED. THE NET IMPACT OF THESE MATTERS ON THE

CORPORATION’S CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL RESULTS CANNOT BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED.

REGARDLESS, THE CORPORATION DOES NOT EXPECT THE RESOLUTION TO HAVE A MATERIAL

EFFECT UPON THE CORPORATION’S OPERATIONS OR FINANCIAL CONDITION.

AN AFFILIATE OF EXXONMOBIL IS ONE OF THE

CONTRACTORS UNDER A PRODUCTION SHARING CONTRACT (PSC) WITH THE NIGERIAN

NATIONAL PETROLEUM CORPORATION (NNPC) COVERING THE ERHA BLOCK LOCATED IN THE

OFFSHORE WATERS OF NIGERIA. EXXONMOBIL'S AFFILIATE IS THE OPERATOR OF THE BLOCK

AND OWNS A 56.25 PERCENT INTEREST UNDER THE PSC. THE CONTRACTORS ARE IN DISPUTE

WITH NNPC REGARDING NNPC'S LIFTING OF CRUDE OIL IN EXCESS OF ITS ENTITLEMENT

UNDER THE TERMS OF THE PSC. IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE TERMS OF THE PSC, THE

CONTRACTORS INITIATED ARBITRATION IN ABUJA, NIGERIA, UNDER THE NIGERIAN

ARBITRATION AND CONCILIATION ACT. ON OCTOBER 24, 2011, A THREE-MEMBER

ARBITRAL TRIBUNAL ISSUED AN AWARD UPHOLDING THE CONTRACTORS' POSITION IN ALL

MATERIAL RESPECTS AND AWARDING DAMAGES TO THE CONTRACTORS JOINTLY IN AN AMOUNT

OF APPROXIMATELY $1.8 BILLION PLUS $234 MILLION IN ACCRUED INTEREST. THE CONTRACTORS

PETITIONED A NIGERIAN FEDERAL COURT FOR ENFORCEMENT OF THE AWARD, AND NNPC

PETITIONED THE SAME COURT TO HAVE THE AWARD SET ASIDE. ON MAY 22, 2012, THE

COURT SET ASIDE THE AWARD. THE CONTRACTORS HAVE APPEALED THAT JUDGMENT. IN JUNE

2013, THE CONTRACTORS FILED A LAWSUIT AGAINST NNPC IN THE NIGERIAN FEDERAL HIGH

COURT IN ORDER TO PRESERVE THEIR ABILITY TO SEEK ENFORCEMENT OF THE PSC IN THE

COURTS IF NECESSARY. IN OCTOBER 2014, THE CONTRACTORS FILED SUIT IN THE UNITED

STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK TO ENFORCE, IF

NECESSARY, THE ARBITRATION AWARD AGAINST NNPC ASSETS RESIDING WITHIN THAT

JURISDICTION. AT THIS TIME, THE NET IMPACT OF THIS MATTER ON THE CORPORATION'S

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL RESULTS CANNOT BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED. HOWEVER,

REGARDLESS OF THE OUTCOME OF ENFORCEMENT PROCEEDINGS, THE CORPORATION DOES NOT

EXPECT THE PROCEEDINGS TO HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT UPON THE CORPORATION'S

OPERATIONS OR FINANCIAL CONDITION.

FOR SELECTION OF THE DISCOUNT RATE FOR

U.S. PLANS, SEVERAL SOURCES OF INFORMATION ARE CONSIDERED, INCLUDING INTEREST

RATE MARKET INDICATORS AND THE DISCOUNT RATE DETERMINED BY USE OF A YIELD CURVE

BASED ON HIGH-QUALITY, NONCALLABLE BONDS WITH CASH FLOWS THAT MATCH ESTIMATED

OUTFLOWS FOR BENEFIT PAYMENTS. FOR MAJOR NON-U.S. PLANS, THE DISCOUNT RATE IS

DETERMINED BY USING BOND PORTFOLIOS WITH AN AVERAGE MATURITY APPROXIMATING THAT

OF THE LIABILITIES OR SPOT YIELD CURVES, BOTH OF WHICH ARE CONSTRUCTED

USING HIGH-QUALITY, LOCAL-CURRENCY-DENOMINATED BONDS.

THE MEASUREMENT

OF THE ACCUMULATED POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATION ASSUMES A HEALTH CARE COST

TREND RATE OF 4.5 PERCENT IN 2016 AND SUBSEQUENT YEARS. A ONE-PERCENTAGE-POINT

INCREASE IN THE HEALTH CARE COST TREND RATE WOULD INCREASE SERVICE AND INTEREST

COST BY $91 MILLION AND THE POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATION BY $1,070

MILLION. A ONE-PERCENTAGE-POINT DECREASE IN THE HEALTH CARE COST TREND RATE

WOULD DECREASE SERVICE AND INTEREST COST BY $69 MILLION AND THE POSTRETIREMENT

BENEFIT OBLIGATION BY $844 MILLION.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

THE FUNDING LEVELS OF ALL QUALIFIED

PENSION PLANS ARE IN COMPLIANCE WITH STANDARDS SET BY APPLICABLE LAW OR

REGULATION. AS SHOWN IN THE TABLE BELOW, CERTAIN SMALLER U.S. PENSION PLANS AND

A NUMBER OF NON-U.S. PENSION PLANS ARE NOT FUNDED BECAUSE LOCAL TAX CONVENTIONS

AND REGULATORY PRACTICES DO NOT ENCOURAGE FUNDING OF THESE PLANS. ALL

DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION OBLIGATIONS, REGARDLESS OF THE FUNDING STATUS

OF THE UNDERLYING PLANS, ARE FULLY SUPPORTED BY THE FINANCIAL STRENGTH

OF THE CORPORATION OR THE RESPECTIVE SPONSORING AFFILIATE.

THE LONG-TERM

EXPECTED RATE OF RETURN ON FUNDED ASSETS SHOWN BELOW IS ESTABLISHED FOR EACH

BENEFIT PLAN BY DEVELOPING A FORWARD-LOOKING, LONG-TERM RETURN ASSUMPTION FOR

EACH ASSET CLASS, TAKING INTO ACCOUNT FACTORS SUCH AS THE EXPECTED REAL

RETURN FOR THE SPECIFIC ASSET CLASS AND INFLATION. A SINGLE, LONG-TERM RATE OF

RETURN IS THEN CALCULATED AS THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE OF THE TARGET ASSET

ALLOCATION PERCENTAGES AND THE LONG-TERM RETURN ASSUMPTION FOR EACH ASSET CLASS.

THE CORPORATION’S INVESTMENT STRATEGY FOR

BENEFIT PLAN ASSETS REFLECTS A LONG-TERM VIEW, A CAREFUL ASSESSMENT OF THE

RISKS INHERENT IN VARIOUS ASSET CLASSES AND BROAD DIVERSIFICATION TO REDUCE THE

RISK OF THE PORTFOLIO. THE BENEFIT PLAN ASSETS ARE PRIMARILY INVESTED IN

PASSIVE EQUITY AND FIXED INCOME INDEX FUNDS TO DIVERSIFY RISK WHILE

MINIMIZING COSTS. THE EQUITY FUNDS HOLD EXXONMOBIL STOCK ONLY TO THE EXTENT

NECESSARY TO REPLICATE THE RELEVANT EQUITY INDEX. THE FIXED INCOME FUNDS ARE

LARGELY INVESTED IN HIGH-QUALITY CORPORATE AND GOVERNMENT DEBT SECURITIES.

STUDIES ARE PERIODICALLY CONDUCTED TO ESTABLISH THE

PREFERRED TARGET ASSET ALLOCATION PERCENTAGES. THE TARGET ASSET ALLOCATION FOR

THE U.S. BENEFIT PLANS AND FOR THE NON-U.S. PLANS IN AGGREGATE IS 40 PERCENT

EQUITY SECURITIES AND 60 PERCENT DEBT SECURITIES. THE EQUITY TARGETS FOR THE

U.S. AND NON-U.S. PLANS INCLUDE AN ALLOCATION TO PRIVATE EQUITY PARTNERSHIPS

THAT PRIMARILY FOCUS ON EARLY-STAGE VENTURE CAPITAL OF 5 PERCENT AND 3 PERCENT,

RESPECTIVELY.

THE FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT LEVELS ARE ACCOUNTING TERMS THAT

REFER TO DIFFERENT METHODS OF VALUING ASSETS. THE TERMS DO NOT REPRESENT THE

RELATIVE RISK OR CREDIT QUALITY OF AN INVESTMENT.

18. DISCLOSURES ABOUT SEGMENTS AND RELATED

INFORMATION

THE

UPSTREAM, DOWNSTREAM AND CHEMICAL FUNCTIONS BEST DEFINE THE OPERATING SEGMENTS

OF THE BUSINESS THAT ARE REPORTED SEPARATELY. THE FACTORS USED TO IDENTIFY

THESE REPORTABLE SEGMENTS ARE BASED ON THE NATURE OF THE OPERATIONS THAT ARE

UNDERTAKEN BY EACH SEGMENT. THE UPSTREAM SEGMENT IS ORGANIZED AND OPERATES TO

EXPLORE FOR AND PRODUCE CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS. THE DOWNSTREAM SEGMENT IS

ORGANIZED AND OPERATES TO MANUFACTURE AND SELL PETROLEUM PRODUCTS. THE CHEMICAL

SEGMENT IS ORGANIZED AND OPERATES TO MANUFACTURE AND SELL PETROCHEMICALS. THESE

SEGMENTS ARE BROADLY UNDERSTOOD ACROSS THE PETROLEUM AND PETROCHEMICAL

INDUSTRIES.

THESE FUNCTIONS HAVE BEEN DEFINED AS THE OPERATING SEGMENTS

OF THE CORPORATION BECAUSE THEY ARE THE SEGMENTS (1) THAT ENGAGE IN

BUSINESS ACTIVITIES FROM WHICH REVENUES ARE EARNED AND EXPENSES ARE INCURRED;

(2) WHOSE OPERATING RESULTS ARE REGULARLY REVIEWED BY THE CORPORATION’S

CHIEF OPERATING DECISION MAKER TO MAKE DECISIONS ABOUT RESOURCES TO BE

ALLOCATED TO THE SEGMENT AND TO ASSESS ITS PERFORMANCE; AND (3) FOR WHICH

DISCRETE FINANCIAL INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE.

EARNINGS AFTER INCOME TAX INCLUDE TRANSFERS AT ESTIMATED

MARKET PRICES.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

IN CORPORATE AND FINANCING ACTIVITIES,

SECURITIES. INTEREST EXPENSE INCLUDES NON-DEBT-RELATED INTEREST EXPENSE OF $129

MILLION AND $202 MILLION IN 2014 AND 2012, RESPECTIVELY. FOR 2013,

NON-DEBT-RELATED INTEREST EXPENSE WAS A NET CREDIT OF $123 MILLION, PRIMARILY

REFLECTING THE EFFECT OF CREDITS FROM THE FAVORABLE RESOLUTION OF PRIOR YEAR

TAX POSITIONS.

THE GROSS UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFIT

BALANCES SHOWN ABOVE ARE PREDOMINANTLY RELATED TO TAX POSITIONS THAT WOULD

REDUCE THE CORPORATION’S EFFECTIVE TAX RATE IF THE POSITIONS ARE FAVORABLY

RESOLVED. UNFAVORABLE RESOLUTION OF THESE TAX POSITIONS GENERALLY WOULD NOT

INCREASE THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE. THE 2014, 2013 AND 2012 CHANGES IN

UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS DID NOT HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE CORPORATION’S

NET INCOME.

RESOLUTION OF THESE TAX POSITIONS THROUGH NEGOTIATIONS WITH

THE RELEVANT TAX AUTHORITIES OR THROUGH LITIGATION WILL TAKE MANY YEARS TO

COMPLETE. IT IS DIFFICULT TO PREDICT THE TIMING OF RESOLUTION FOR TAX POSITIONS

SINCE SUCH TIMING IS NOT ENTIRELY WITHIN THE CONTROL OF THE CORPORATION. IT IS

REASONABLY POSSIBLE THAT THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS COULD

INCREASE BY UP TO 30 PERCENT IN THE NEXT 12 MONTHS, WITH NO MATERIAL

IMPACT ON THE CORPORATION’S NET INCOME.

OIL AND

GAS RESERVES

THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION DESCRIBES CHANGES DURING THE

YEARS AND BALANCES OF PROVED OIL AND GAS RESERVES AT YEAR-END 2012, 2013, AND

2014.

THE DEFINITIONS USED ARE IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE SECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION’S RULE 4-10 (A) OF REGULATION S-X.

PROVED OIL AND GAS RESERVES ARE THOSE QUANTITIES OF OIL AND

GAS, WHICH, BY ANALYSIS OF GEOSCIENCE AND ENGINEERING DATA, CAN BE ESTIMATED

WITH REASONABLE CERTAINTY TO BE ECONOMICALLY PRODUCIBLE – FROM A GIVEN DATE

FORWARD, FROM KNOWN RESERVOIRS, AND UNDER EXISTING ECONOMIC CONDITIONS,

OPERATING METHODS AND GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS – PRIOR TO THE TIME AT WHICH

CONTRACTS PROVIDING THE RIGHT TO OPERATE EXPIRE, UNLESS EVIDENCE INDICATES THAT

RENEWAL IS REASONABLY CERTAIN. IN SOME CASES, SUBSTANTIAL NEW INVESTMENTS IN

ADDITIONAL WELLS AND RELATED FACILITIES WILL BE REQUIRED TO RECOVER THESE

PROVED RESERVES.

IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION’S

RULES, THE YEAR-END RESERVES VOLUMES AS WELL AS THE RESERVES CHANGE CATEGORIES

SHOWN IN THE FOLLOWING TABLES WERE CALCULATED USING AVERAGE PRICES DURING THE

12-MONTH PERIOD PRIOR TO THE ENDING DATE OF THE PERIOD COVERED BY THE REPORT,

DETERMINED AS AN UNWEIGHTED ARITHMETIC AVERAGE OF THE FIRST-DAY-OF-THE-MONTH

PRICE FOR EACH MONTH WITHIN SUCH PERIOD. THESE RESERVES QUANTITIES ARE ALSO

USED IN CALCULATING UNIT-OF-PRODUCTION DEPRECIATION RATES AND IN CALCULATING

THE STANDARDIZED MEASURE OF DISCOUNTED NET CASH FLOW.

REVISIONS CAN INCLUDE UPWARD OR DOWNWARD CHANGES IN

PREVIOUSLY ESTIMATED VOLUMES OF PROVED RESERVES FOR EXISTING FIELDS DUE TO THE

EVALUATION OR RE-EVALUATION OF (1) ALREADY AVAILABLE GEOLOGIC, RESERVOIR

OR PRODUCTION DATA, (2) NEW GEOLOGIC, RESERVOIR OR PRODUCTION DATA OR

(3) CHANGES IN AVERAGE PRICES AND YEAR-END COSTS THAT ARE USED IN THE

ESTIMATION OF RESERVES. THIS CATEGORY CAN ALSO INCLUDE SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN

EITHER DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY OR PRODUCTION EQUIPMENT/FACILITY CAPACITY.

PROVED RESERVES INCLUDE 100 PERCENT OF EACH MAJORITY-OWNED

AFFILIATE’S PARTICIPATION IN PROVED RESERVES AND EXXONMOBIL’S OWNERSHIP

PERCENTAGE OF THE PROVED RESERVES OF EQUITY COMPANIES, BUT EXCLUDE ROYALTIES

AND QUANTITIES DUE OTHERS. GAS RESERVES EXCLUDE THE GASEOUS EQUIVALENT OF

LIQUIDS EXPECTED TO BE REMOVED FROM THE GAS ON LEASES, AT FIELD FACILITIES AND

AT GAS PROCESSING PLANTS. THESE LIQUIDS ARE INCLUDED IN NET PROVED RESERVES OF

CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS LIQUIDS.

IN THE PROVED RESERVES TABLES, CONSOLIDATED RESERVES AND

EQUITY COMPANY RESERVES ARE REPORTED SEPARATELY. HOWEVER, THE CORPORATION DOES

NOT VIEW EQUITY COMPANY RESERVES ANY DIFFERENTLY THAN THOSE FROM CONSOLIDATED

COMPANIES.

RESERVES REPORTED UNDER PRODUCTION SHARING AND OTHER

NONCONCESSIONARY AGREEMENTS ARE BASED ON THE ECONOMIC INTEREST AS DEFINED BY

THE SPECIFIC FISCAL TERMS IN THE AGREEMENT. THE PRODUCTION AND RESERVES THAT WE

REPORT FOR THESE TYPES OF ARRANGEMENTS TYPICALLY VARY INVERSELY WITH OIL AND

GAS PRICE CHANGES. AS OIL AND GAS PRICES INCREASE, THE CASH FLOW AND VALUE

RECEIVED BY THE COMPANY INCREASE; HOWEVER, THE PRODUCTION VOLUMES AND RESERVES

REQUIRED TO ACHIEVE THIS VALUE WILL TYPICALLY BE LOWER BECAUSE OF THE HIGHER

PRICES. WHEN PRICES DECREASE, THE OPPOSITE EFFECT GENERALLY OCCURS. THE

PERCENTAGE OF TOTAL LIQUIDS AND NATURAL GAS PROVED RESERVES (CONSOLIDATED

SUBSIDIARIES PLUS EQUITY COMPANIES) AT YEAR-END 2014 THAT WERE ASSOCIATED WITH

PRODUCTION SHARING CONTRACT ARRANGEMENTS WAS 11 PERCENT OF LIQUIDS, 9 PERCENT

OF NATURAL GAS AND 10 PERCENT ON AN OIL-EQUIVALENT BASIS (GAS CONVERTED TO

OIL-EQUIVALENT AT 6 BILLION CUBIC FEET = 1 MILLION BARRELS).

NET PROVED DEVELOPED RESERVES ARE THOSE VOLUMES THAT ARE

EXPECTED TO BE RECOVERED THROUGH EXISTING WELLS WITH EXISTING EQUIPMENT AND

OPERATING METHODS OR IN WHICH THE COST OF THE REQUIRED EQUIPMENT IS RELATIVELY

MINOR COMPARED TO THE COST OF A NEW WELL. NET PROVED UNDEVELOPED RESERVES ARE

THOSE VOLUMES THAT ARE EXPECTED TO BE RECOVERED FROM NEW WELLS ON UNDRILLED

ACREAGE, OR FROM EXISTING WELLS WHERE A RELATIVELY MAJOR EXPENDITURE IS

REQUIRED FOR RECOMPLETION.

CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS LIQUIDS AND NATURAL GAS

PRODUCTION QUANTITIES SHOWN ARE THE NET VOLUMES WITHDRAWN FROM EXXONMOBIL’S OIL

AND GAS RESERVES. THE NATURAL GAS QUANTITIES DIFFER FROM THE QUANTITIES OF GAS

DELIVERED FOR SALE BY THE PRODUCING FUNCTION AS REPORTED IN THE OPERATING

SUMMARY DUE TO VOLUMES CONSUMED OR FLARED AND INVENTORY CHANGES.

THE CHANGES, BETWEEN 2013 YEAR-END PROVED RESERVES AND 2014

YEAR-END PROVED RESERVES, PRIMARILY REFLECT THE REVISIONS, EXTENSIONS AND

DISCOVERIES IN CANADA AND THE UNITED STATES.

STANDARDIZED MEASURE OF DISCOUNTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS

AS REQUIRED BY THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING

STANDARDS BOARD, THE STANDARDIZED MEASURE OF DISCOUNTED FUTURE NET CASH FLOWS

IS COMPUTED BY APPLYING FIRST-DAY-OF-THE-MONTH AVERAGE PRICES,

YEAR-END COSTS AND LEGISLATED TAX RATES AND A DISCOUNT FACTOR OF 10 PERCENT

TO NET PROVED RESERVES. THE STANDARDIZED MEASURE INCLUDES COSTS FOR

FUTURE DISMANTLEMENT, ABANDONMENT AND REHABILITATION OBLIGATIONS.

THE CORPORATION BELIEVES THE STANDARDIZED MEASURE DOES NOT PROVIDE

A RELIABLE ESTIMATE OF THE CORPORATION’S EXPECTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS TO BE

OBTAINED FROM THE DEVELOPMENT AND PRODUCTION OF ITS OIL AND GAS PROPERTIES OR

OF THE VALUE OF ITS PROVED OIL AND GAS RESERVES. THE STANDARDIZED MEASURE IS

PREPARED ON THE BASIS OF CERTAIN PRESCRIBED ASSUMPTIONS INCLUDING

FIRST-DAY-OF-THE-MONTH AVERAGE PRICES, WHICH REPRESENT DISCRETE POINTS IN TIME

AND THEREFORE MAY CAUSE SIGNIFICANT VARIABILITY IN CASH FLOWS FROM YEAR TO YEAR

AS PRICES CHANGE.
