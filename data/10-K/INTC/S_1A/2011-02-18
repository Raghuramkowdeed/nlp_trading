ITEM 1A.

RISK

FACTORS

FLUCTUATIONS

IN DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS MAY HARM OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS AND

ARE DIFFICULT TO FORECAST.

IF DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS FLUCTUATES, OUR REVENUE AND

PROFITABILITY COULD BE HARMED. IMPORTANT FACTORS THAT COULD

CAUSE DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS TO FLUCTUATE INCLUDE.



CHANGES IN BUSINESS AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, INCLUDING DOWNTURNS

IN THE SEMICONDUCTOR INDUSTRY

AND/OR

THE

OVERALL ECONOMY;



CHANGES IN CONSUMER CONFIDENCE CAUSED BY CHANGES IN MARKET

CONDITIONS, INCLUDING CHANGES IN THE CREDIT MARKET, EXPECTATIONS

FOR INFLATION, UNEMPLOYMENT LEVELS, AND ENERGY OR OTHER

COMMODITY PRICES;



CHANGES IN THE LEVEL OF CUSTOMERS COMPONENTS INVENTORIES;



COMPETITIVE PRESSURES, INCLUDING PRICING PRESSURES, FROM

COMPANIES THAT HAVE COMPETING PRODUCTS, CHIP ARCHITECTURES,

MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGIES, AND MARKETING PROGRAMS;



CHANGES IN CUSTOMER PRODUCT NEEDS;



STRATEGIC ACTIONS TAKEN BY OUR COMPETITORS; AND



MARKET ACCEPTANCE OF OUR PRODUCTS.

IF PRODUCT DEMAND DECREASES, OUR MANUFACTURING OR ASSEMBLY AND

TEST CAPACITY COULD BE UNDERUTILIZED, AND WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO

RECORD AN IMPAIRMENT ON OUR LONG-LIVED ASSETS, INCLUDING

FACILITIES AND EQUIPMENT AS WELL AS INTANGIBLE ASSETS, WHICH

WOULD INCREASE OUR EXPENSES. IN ADDITION, IF PRODUCT DEMAND

DECREASES OR WE FAIL TO FORECAST DEMAND ACCURATELY, WE COULD BE

REQUIRED TO WRITE OFF INVENTORY OR RECORD EXCESS CAPACITY

CHARGES, WHICH WOULD HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON OUR GROSS MARGIN.

FACTORY-PLANNING DECISIONS MAY SHORTEN THE USEFUL LIVES OF

LONG-LIVED ASSETS, INCLUDING FACILITIES AND EQUIPMENT, AND CAUSE

US TO ACCELERATE DEPRECIATION. IN THE LONG TERM, IF PRODUCT

DEMAND INCREASES, WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO ADD MANUFACTURING OR

ASSEMBLY AND TEST CAPACITY FAST ENOUGH TO MEET MARKET DEMAND.

THESE CHANGES IN DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS, AND CHANGES IN OUR

CUSTOMERS PRODUCT NEEDS, COULD HAVE A VARIETY OF NEGATIVE

EFFECTS ON OUR COMPETITIVE POSITION AND OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS,

AND, IN CERTAIN CASES, MAY REDUCE OUR REVENUE, INCREASE OUR

COSTS, LOWER OUR GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE, OR REQUIRE US TO

RECOGNIZE IMPAIRMENTS OF OUR ASSETS.

THE

SEMICONDUCTOR INDUSTRY AND OUR OPERATIONS ARE CHARACTERIZED BY A

HIGH PERCENTAGE OF COSTS THAT ARE FIXED OR DIFFICULT TO REDUCE

IN THE SHORT TERM, AND BY PRODUCT DEMAND THAT IS HIGHLY VARIABLE

AND SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT DOWNTURNS THAT MAY HARM OUR BUSINESS,

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

THE SEMICONDUCTOR INDUSTRY AND OUR OPERATIONS ARE CHARACTERIZED

BY HIGH COSTS, SUCH AS THOSE RELATED TO FACILITY CONSTRUCTION

AND EQUIPMENT, R&D, AND EMPLOYMENT AND TRAINING OF A HIGHLY

SKILLED WORKFORCE, THAT ARE EITHER FIXED OR DIFFICULT TO REDUCE

IN THE SHORT TERM. AT THE SAME TIME, DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS IS

HIGHLY VARIABLE AND THERE HAVE BEEN DOWNTURNS, OFTEN IN

CONNECTION WITH MATURING PRODUCT CYCLES AND GENERAL ECONOMIC

MARKET CONDITIONS. THESE DOWNTURNS HAVE BEEN CHARACTERIZED BY

REDUCED PRODUCT DEMAND, MANUFACTURING OVERCAPACITY AND RESULTING

EXCESS CAPACITY CHARGES, HIGH INVENTORY LEVELS, AND LOWER

AVERAGE SELLING PRICES. THE COMBINATION OF THESE FACTORS MAY

CAUSE OUR REVENUE, GROSS MARGIN, CASH FLOW, AND PROFITABILITY TO

VARY SIGNIFICANTLY IN BOTH THE SHORT AND LONG TERM.

WE

OPERATE IN INTENSELY COMPETITIVE INDUSTRIES, AND OUR FAILURE TO

RESPOND QUICKLY TO TECHNOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENTS AND INCORPORATE

NEW FEATURES INTO OUR PRODUCTS COULD HARM OUR ABILITY TO

COMPETE.

WE OPERATE IN INTENSELY COMPETITIVE INDUSTRIES THAT EXPERIENCE

RAPID TECHNOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENTS, CHANGES IN INDUSTRY STANDARDS,

CHANGES IN CUSTOMER REQUIREMENTS, AND FREQUENT NEW PRODUCT

INTRODUCTIONS AND IMPROVEMENTS. IF WE ARE UNABLE TO RESPOND

QUICKLY AND SUCCESSFULLY TO THESE DEVELOPMENTS, WE MAY LOSE OUR

COMPETITIVE POSITION, AND OUR PRODUCTS OR TECHNOLOGIES MAY

BECOME UNCOMPETITIVE OR OBSOLETE. AS NEW COMPUTING MARKET

SEGMENTS EMERGE, SUCH AS NETBOOKS, HANDHELDS, TABLETS, AND

CONSUMER ELECTRONICS DEVICES, WE FACE NEW SOURCES OF

COMPETITION, AND CUSTOMERS THAT HAVE DIFFERENT REQUIREMENTS THAN

CUSTOMERS IN OUR TRADITIONAL PC BUSINESS. TO BE SUCCESSFUL, WE

NEED TO CULTIVATE NEW INDUSTRY RELATIONSHIPS IN THESE MARKET

SEGMENTS. AS THE NUMBER AND VARIETY OF INTERNET-CONNECTED

DEVICES INCREASE, WE NEED TO IMPROVE THE COST, ENERGY

EFFICIENCY, AND SECURITY FUNCTIONALITY OF OUR MICROPROCESSORS TO

SUCCEED IN THESE NEW MARKET SEGMENTS. IN ADDITION, WE NEED TO

FOCUS ON THE ACQUISITION AND DEVELOPMENT OF OUR SOFTWARE

CAPABILITIES IN ORDER TO PROVIDE CUSTOMERS WITH COMPLETE

COMPUTING SOLUTIONS.

TO COMPETE SUCCESSFULLY, WE MUST MAINTAIN A SUCCESSFUL R&D

EFFORT, DEVELOP NEW PRODUCTS AND PRODUCTION PROCESSES, AND

IMPROVE OUR EXISTING PRODUCTS AND PROCESSES AT THE SAME PACE OR

AHEAD OF OUR COMPETITORS. OUR R&D EFFORTS ARE AIMED AT

SOLVING INCREASINGLY COMPLEX PROBLEMS, AND WE DO NOT EXPECT THAT

ALL OF OUR PROJECTS WILL BE SUCCESSFUL. IF OUR R&D EFFORTS

ARE UNSUCCESSFUL, OUR FUTURE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COULD BE

MATERIALLY HARMED. WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO DEVELOP AND MARKET

THESE NEW PRODUCTS SUCCESSFULLY, THE PRODUCTS WE INVEST IN AND

DEVELOP MAY NOT BE WELL RECEIVED BY CUSTOMERS, AND PRODUCTS

DEVELOPED AND NEW TECHNOLOGIES OFFERED BY OTHERS MAY AFFECT

DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS. THESE TYPES OF EVENTS COULD HAVE A

VARIETY OF NEGATIVE EFFECTS ON OUR COMPETITIVE POSITION AND OUR

FINANCIAL RESULTS, SUCH AS REDUCING OUR REVENUE, INCREASING OUR

COSTS, LOWERING OUR GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE, AND REQUIRING US TO

RECOGNIZE IMPAIRMENTS ON OUR ASSETS.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

LITIGATION

OR REGULATORY PROCEEDINGS COULD HARM OUR BUSINESS.

WE MAY BE SUBJECT TO LEGAL CLAIMS OR REGULATORY MATTERS

INVOLVING STOCKHOLDER, CONSUMER, COMPETITION, AND OTHER ISSUES

ON A GLOBAL BASIS. AS DESCRIBED IN NOTE 29.

CONTINGENCIES IN PART II, ITEM 8 OF THIS FORM

10-K,

WE ARE

CURRENTLY ENGAGED IN A NUMBER OF LITIGATION AND REGULATORY

MATTERS. LITIGATION AND REGULATORY PROCEEDINGS ARE SUBJECT TO

INHERENT UNCERTAINTIES, AND UNFAVORABLE RULINGS COULD OCCUR. AN

UNFAVORABLE RULING COULD INCLUDE MONETARY DAMAGES OR, IN CASES

FOR WHICH INJUNCTIVE RELIEF IS SOUGHT, AN INJUNCTION PROHIBITING

US FROM MANUFACTURING OR SELLING ONE OR MORE PRODUCTS,

PRECLUDING PARTICULAR BUSINESS PRACTICES, OR REQUIRING OTHER

REMEDIES, SUCH AS COMPULSORY LICENSING OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY.

IF WE WERE TO RECEIVE AN UNFAVORABLE RULING IN A MATTER, OUR

BUSINESS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COULD BE MATERIALLY HARMED.

FLUCTUATIONS

IN THE MIX OF PRODUCTS SOLD MAY HARM OUR FINANCIAL

RESULTS.

BECAUSE OF THE WIDE PRICE DIFFERENCES AMONG AND WITHIN NOTEBOOK,

NETBOOK, TABLET, DESKTOP, AND SERVER MICROPROCESSORS, THE MIX

AND TYPES OF PERFORMANCE CAPABILITIES OF MICROPROCESSORS SOLD

AFFECT THE AVERAGE SELLING PRICE OF OUR PRODUCTS AND HAVE A

SUBSTANTIAL IMPACT ON OUR REVENUE AND GROSS MARGIN. OUR

FINANCIAL RESULTS ALSO DEPEND IN PART ON THE MIX OF OTHER

PRODUCTS THAT WE SELL, SUCH AS CHIPSETS, FLASH MEMORY, AND OTHER

SEMICONDUCTOR PRODUCTS. IN ADDITION, MORE RECENTLY INTRODUCED

PRODUCTS TEND TO HAVE HIGHER ASSOCIATED COSTS BECAUSE OF INITIAL

OVERALL DEVELOPMENT AND PRODUCTION RAMP. FLUCTUATIONS IN THE MIX

AND TYPES OF OUR PRODUCTS MAY ALSO AFFECT THE EXTENT TO WHICH WE

ARE ABLE TO RECOVER THE FIXED COSTS AND INVESTMENTS ASSOCIATED

WITH A PARTICULAR PRODUCT, AND AS A RESULT CAN HARM OUR

FINANCIAL RESULTS.

OUR

GLOBAL OPERATIONS SUBJECT US TO RISKS THAT MAY HARM OUR RESULTS

OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

WE HAVE SALES OFFICES, R&D, MANUFACTURING, AND ASSEMBLY AND

TEST FACILITIES IN MANY COUNTRIES, AND SOME BUSINESS ACTIVITIES

MAY BE CONCENTRATED IN ONE OR MORE GEOGRAPHIC AREAS. AS A

RESULT, WE ARE SUBJECT TO RISKS THAT MAY LIMIT OUR ABILITY TO

MANUFACTURE, ASSEMBLE AND TEST, DESIGN, DEVELOP, OR SELL

PRODUCTS IN PARTICULAR COUNTRIES OR ON A GEOGRAPHIC BASIS, WHICH

COULD HARM OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION,

INCLUDING.



SECURITY CONCERNS, SUCH AS ARMED CONFLICT AND CIVIL OR MILITARY

UNREST, CRIME, POLITICAL INSTABILITY, AND TERRORIST ACTIVITY;



HEALTH CONCERNS;



NATURAL DISASTERS;



INEFFICIENT AND LIMITED INFRASTRUCTURE AND DISRUPTIONS, SUCH AS

LARGE-SCALE OUTAGES OR INTERRUPTIONS OF SERVICE FROM UTILITIES,

TRANSPORTATION, OR TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROVIDERS AND SUPPLY CHAIN

INTERRUPTIONS;



RESTRICTIONS ON OUR OPERATIONS BY GOVERNMENTS SEEKING TO SUPPORT

LOCAL INDUSTRIES, NATIONALIZATION OF OUR OPERATIONS, AND

RESTRICTIONS ON OUR ABILITY TO REPATRIATE EARNINGS;



DIFFERING EMPLOYMENT PRACTICES AND LABOR ISSUES;



LOCAL BUSINESS AND CULTURAL FACTORS THAT DIFFER FROM OUR NORMAL

STANDARDS AND PRACTICES, INCLUDING BUSINESS PRACTICES THAT WE

ARE PROHIBITED FROM ENGAGING IN BY THE FOREIGN CORRUPT PRACTICES

ACT AND OTHER ANTI-CORRUPTION LAWS AND REGULATIONS; AND



REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS AND PROHIBITIONS THAT DIFFER AMONG

JURISDICTIONS.

VIOLATIONS OF THESE LAWS AND REGULATIONS COULD RESULT IN FINES;

CRIMINAL SANCTIONS AGAINST US, OUR OFFICERS, OR OUR EMPLOYEES;

PROHIBITIONS ON THE CONDUCT OF OUR BUSINESS; AND DAMAGE TO OUR

REPUTATION. ALTHOUGH WE HAVE IMPLEMENTED POLICIES, CONTROLS, AND

PROCEDURES DESIGNED TO ENSURE COMPLIANCE WITH THESE LAWS, OUR

EMPLOYEES, CONTRACTORS, OR AGENTS MAY VIOLATE OUR POLICIES.

IN ADDITION, ALTHOUGH SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR PRODUCTS ARE SOLD

IN U.S. DOLLARS, WE INCUR A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF CERTAIN TYPES

OF EXPENSES, SUCH AS PAYROLL, UTILITIES, TAX, AND MARKETING

EXPENSES, AS WELL AS CONDUCT CERTAIN INVESTING AND FINANCING

ACTIVITIES, IN LOCAL CURRENCIES. OUR HEDGING PROGRAMS REDUCE,

BUT DO NOT ENTIRELY ELIMINATE, THE IMPACT OF CURRENCY EXCHANGE

RATE MOVEMENTS; THEREFORE, FLUCTUATIONS IN EXCHANGE RATES COULD

HARM OUR RESULTS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. IN ADDITION, CHANGES

IN TARIFF AND IMPORT REGULATIONS AND IN U.S. AND

NON-U.S.

MONETARY POLICIES MAY HARM OUR RESULTS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

BY INCREASING OUR EXPENSES AND REDUCING OUR REVENUE. VARYING TAX

RATES IN DIFFERENT JURISDICTIONS COULD HARM OUR RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION BY INCREASING OUR OVERALL TAX

RATE.

WE MAINTAIN A PROGRAM OF INSURANCE COVERAGE FOR VARIOUS TYPES OF

PROPERTY, CASUALTY, AND OTHER RISKS. WE PLACE OUR INSURANCE

COVERAGE WITH VARIOUS CARRIERS IN NUMEROUS JURISDICTIONS.

HOWEVER, THERE IS A RISK THAT ONE OR MORE OF OUR INSURANCE

PROVIDERS MAY BE UNABLE TO PAY A CLAIM. THE TYPES AND AMOUNTS OF

INSURANCE THAT WE OBTAIN VARY FROM TIME TO TIME AND FROM

LOCATION TO LOCATION, DEPENDING ON AVAILABILITY, COST, AND OUR

DECISIONS WITH RESPECT TO RISK RETENTION. THE POLICIES ARE

SUBJECT TO DEDUCTIBLES AND EXCLUSIONS THAT RESULT IN OUR

RETENTION OF A LEVEL OF RISK ON A SELF-INSURANCE BASIS. LOSSES

NOT COVERED BY INSURANCE MAY BE SUBSTANTIAL, WHICH COULD HARM

OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

FAILURE

TO MEET OUR PRODUCTION TARGETS, RESULTING IN UNDERSUPPLY OR

OVERSUPPLY OF PRODUCTS, MAY HARM OUR BUSINESS AND RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS.

PRODUCTION OF INTEGRATED CIRCUITS IS A COMPLEX PROCESS.

DISRUPTIONS IN THIS PROCESS CAN RESULT FROM INTERRUPTIONS IN OUR

PROCESSES, ERRORS, AND DIFFICULTIES IN OUR DEVELOPMENT AND

IMPLEMENTATION OF NEW PROCESSES; DEFECTS IN MATERIALS;

DISRUPTIONS IN OUR SUPPLY OF MATERIALS OR RESOURCES; AND

DISRUPTIONS AT OUR FABRICATION AND ASSEMBLY AND TEST FACILITIES

DUE TO, FOR EXAMPLE, ACCIDENTS, MAINTENANCE ISSUES, OR UNSAFE

WORKING CONDITIONSALL OF WHICH COULD AFFECT THE TIMING OF

PRODUCTION RAMPS AND YIELDS. WE MAY NOT BE SUCCESSFUL OR

EFFICIENT IN DEVELOPING OR IMPLEMENTING NEW PRODUCTION

PROCESSES. THE OCCURRENCE OF ANY OF THE FOREGOING MAY RESULT IN

OUR FAILURE TO MEET OR INCREASE PRODUCTION AS DESIRED, RESULTING

IN HIGHER COSTS OR SUBSTANTIAL DECREASES IN YIELDS, WHICH COULD

AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO PRODUCE SUFFICIENT VOLUME TO MEET SPECIFIC

PRODUCT DEMAND. THE UNAVAILABILITY OR REDUCED AVAILABILITY OF

CERTAIN PRODUCTS COULD MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT TO DELIVER

COMPUTING PLATFORMS. THE OCCURRENCE OF ANY OF THESE EVENTS COULD

HARM OUR BUSINESS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

WE MAY

HAVE DIFFICULTIES OBTAINING THE RESOURCES OR PRODUCTS WE NEED

FOR MANUFACTURING, ASSEMBLING AND TESTING OUR PRODUCTS, OR

OPERATING OTHER ASPECTS OF OUR BUSINESS, WHICH COULD HARM OUR

ABILITY TO MEET DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS AND MAY INCREASE OUR

COSTS.

WE HAVE THOUSANDS OF SUPPLIERS PROVIDING VARIOUS MATERIALS THAT

WE USE IN THE PRODUCTION OF OUR PRODUCTS AND OTHER ASPECTS OF

OUR BUSINESS, AND WE SEEK, WHERE POSSIBLE, TO HAVE SEVERAL

SOURCES OF SUPPLY FOR ALL OF THOSE MATERIALS. HOWEVER, WE MAY

RELY ON A SINGLE OR A LIMITED NUMBER OF SUPPLIERS, OR UPON

SUPPLIERS IN A SINGLE COUNTRY, FOR THESE MATERIALS. THE

INABILITY OF SUCH SUPPLIERS TO DELIVER ADEQUATE SUPPLIES OF

PRODUCTION MATERIALS OR OTHER SUPPLIES COULD DISRUPT OUR

PRODUCTION PROCESSES OR COULD MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR US TO

IMPLEMENT OUR BUSINESS STRATEGY. IN ADDITION, PRODUCTION COULD

BE DISRUPTED BY THE UNAVAILABILITY OF THE RESOURCES USED IN

PRODUCTION, SUCH AS WATER, SILICON, ELECTRICITY, GASES, AND

OTHER MATERIALS. FUTURE ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS COULD RESTRICT

THE SUPPLY OR INCREASE THE COST OF CERTAIN OF THE MATERIALS THAT

WE CURRENTLY USE IN OUR BUSINESS. ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS ALSO

MAY MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT TO OBTAIN PERMITS TO BUILD OR MODIFY

ADDITIONAL MANUFACTURING CAPACITY TO MEET DEMAND. THE

UNAVAILABILITY OR REDUCED AVAILABILITY OF THE MATERIALS OR

RESOURCES THAT WE USE IN OUR BUSINESS MAY REQUIRE US TO REDUCE

PRODUCTION OF PRODUCTS OR MAY REQUIRE US TO INCUR ADDITIONAL

COSTS IN ORDER TO OBTAIN AN ADEQUATE SUPPLY OF THOSE MATERIALS

OR RESOURCES. THE OCCURRENCE OF ANY OF THESE EVENTS COULD HARM

OUR BUSINESS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

COSTS

RELATED TO PRODUCT DEFECTS AND ERRATA MAY HARM OUR RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS AND BUSINESS.

COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH UNEXPECTED PRODUCT DEFECTS AND ERRATA

(DEVIATIONS FROM PUBLISHED SPECIFICATIONS) DUE TO, FOR EXAMPLE,

UNANTICIPATED PROBLEMS IN OUR DESIGN AND MANUFACTURING

PROCESSES, COULD INCLUDE.



WRITING OFF THE VALUE OF INVENTORY OF SUCH PRODUCTS;



DISPOSING OF PRODUCTS THAT CANNOT BE FIXED;



RECALLING SUCH PRODUCTS THAT HAVE BEEN SHIPPED TO CUSTOMERS;



PROVIDING PRODUCT REPLACEMENTS FOR, OR MODIFICATIONS TO, SUCH

PRODUCTS; AND



DEFENDING AGAINST LITIGATION RELATED TO SUCH PRODUCTS.

THESE COSTS COULD BE SUBSTANTIAL AND MAY THEREFORE INCREASE OUR

EXPENSES AND LOWER OUR GROSS MARGIN. IN ADDITION, OUR REPUTATION

WITH OUR CUSTOMERS OR USERS OF OUR PRODUCTS COULD BE DAMAGED AS

A RESULT OF SUCH PRODUCT DEFECTS AND ERRATA, AND THE DEMAND FOR

OUR PRODUCTS COULD BE REDUCED. THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF PRODUCT

DEFECTS

AND/OR

ERRATA COULD CAUSE CUSTOMERS TO PURCHASE PRODUCTS FROM OUR

COMPETITORS AS A RESULT OF ANTICIPATED SHORTAGES OF INTEL

COMPONENTS OR FOR OTHER REASONS. THESE FACTORS COULD HARM OUR

FINANCIAL RESULTS AND THE PROSPECTS FOR OUR BUSINESS.

WE MAY

BE SUBJECT TO CLAIMS OF INFRINGEMENT OF THIRD-PARTY INTELLECTUAL

PROPERTY RIGHTS, WHICH COULD HARM OUR BUSINESS.

THIRD PARTIES MAY ASSERT AGAINST US OR OUR CUSTOMERS ALLEGED

PATENT, COPYRIGHT, TRADEMARK, OR OTHER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

RIGHTS TO TECHNOLOGIES THAT ARE IMPORTANT TO OUR BUSINESS. WE

ARE CURRENTLY ENGAGED IN A NUMBER OF LITIGATION MATTERS

INVOLVING INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS. WE MAY BE SUBJECT TO

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY INFRINGEMENT CLAIMS FROM CERTAIN

INDIVIDUALS AND COMPANIES, INCLUDING THOSE WHO HAVE ACQUIRED

PATENT PORTFOLIOS FOR THE SOLE PURPOSE OF ASSERTING SUCH CLAIMS

AGAINST OTHER COMPANIES. ANY CLAIMS THAT OUR PRODUCTS OR

PROCESSES INFRINGE THE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS OF OTHERS,

REGARDLESS OF THE MERIT OR RESOLUTION OF SUCH CLAIMS, COULD

CAUSE US TO INCUR SIGNIFICANT COSTS IN RESPONDING TO, DEFENDING,

AND RESOLVING SUCH CLAIMS, AND MAY DIVERT THE EFFORTS AND

ATTENTION OF OUR MANAGEMENT AND TECHNICAL PERSONNEL FROM OUR

BUSINESS. AS A RESULT OF SUCH INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY INFRINGEMENT

CLAIMS, WE COULD BE REQUIRED OR OTHERWISE DECIDE THAT IT IS

APPROPRIATE TO.



PAY THIRD-PARTY INFRINGEMENT CLAIMS;



DISCONTINUE MANUFACTURING, USING, OR SELLING PARTICULAR PRODUCTS

SUBJECT TO INFRINGEMENT CLAIMS;



DISCONTINUE USING THE TECHNOLOGY OR PROCESSES SUBJECT TO

INFRINGEMENT CLAIMS;



DEVELOP OTHER TECHNOLOGY NOT SUBJECT TO INFRINGEMENT CLAIMS,

WHICH COULD BE TIME-CONSUMING AND COSTLY OR MAY NOT BE POSSIBLE;

OR



LICENSE TECHNOLOGY FROM THE THIRD PARTY CLAIMING INFRINGEMENT,

WHICH LICENSE MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE ON COMMERCIALLY REASONABLE

TERMS.

THE OCCURRENCE OF ANY OF THE FOREGOING COULD RESULT IN

UNEXPECTED EXPENSES OR REQUIRE US TO RECOGNIZE AN IMPAIRMENT OF

OUR ASSETS, WHICH WOULD REDUCE THE VALUE OF OUR ASSETS AND

INCREASE EXPENSES. IN ADDITION, IF WE ALTER OR DISCONTINUE OUR

PRODUCTION OF AFFECTED ITEMS, OUR REVENUE COULD BE HARMED.

WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO ENFORCE OR PROTECT OUR INTELLECTUAL

PROPERTY RIGHTS, WHICH MAY HARM OUR ABILITY TO COMPETE AND HARM

OUR BUSINESS.

OUR ABILITY TO ENFORCE OUR PATENTS, COPYRIGHTS, SOFTWARE

LICENSES, AND OTHER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS IS SUBJECT TO

GENERAL LITIGATION RISKS, AS WELL AS UNCERTAINTY AS TO THE

ENFORCEABILITY OF OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS IN VARIOUS

COUNTRIES. WHEN WE SEEK TO ENFORCE OUR RIGHTS, WE ARE OFTEN

SUBJECT TO CLAIMS THAT THE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHT IS

INVALID, IS OTHERWISE NOT ENFORCEABLE, OR IS LICENSED TO THE

PARTY AGAINST WHOM WE ARE ASSERTING A CLAIM. IN ADDITION, OUR

ASSERTION OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS OFTEN RESULTS IN THE

OTHER PARTY SEEKING TO ASSERT ALLEGED INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

RIGHTS OF ITS OWN OR ASSERT OTHER CLAIMS AGAINST US, WHICH COULD

HARM OUR BUSINESS. IF WE ARE NOT ULTIMATELY SUCCESSFUL IN

DEFENDING OURSELVES AGAINST THESE CLAIMS IN LITIGATION, WE MAY

NOT BE ABLE TO SELL A PARTICULAR PRODUCT OR FAMILY OF PRODUCTS

DUE TO AN INJUNCTION, OR WE MAY HAVE TO LICENSE THE TECHNOLOGY

OR PAY DAMAGES THAT COULD, IN TURN, HARM OUR RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS. IN ADDITION, GOVERNMENTS MAY ADOPT REGULATIONS, AND

GOVERNMENTS OR COURTS MAY RENDER DECISIONS, REQUIRING COMPULSORY

LICENSING OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY TO OTHERS, OR GOVERNMENTS MAY

REQUIRE THAT PRODUCTS MEET SPECIFIED STANDARDS THAT SERVE TO

FAVOR LOCAL COMPANIES. OUR INABILITY TO ENFORCE OUR INTELLECTUAL

PROPERTY RIGHTS UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES MAY HARM OUR

COMPETITIVE POSITION AND OUR BUSINESS.

WE MAY

BE SUBJECT TO INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY THEFT OR MISUSE, WHICH COULD

RESULT IN THIRD-PARTY CLAIMS AND HARM OUR BUSINESS AND RESULTS

OF OPERATIONS.

WE REGULARLY FACE ATTEMPTS BY OTHERS TO GAIN UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS

THROUGH THE INTERNET TO OUR INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS, SUCH

AS WHEN THEY MASQUERADE AS AUTHORIZED USERS OR SURREPTITIOUSLY

INTRODUCE SOFTWARE. THESE ATTEMPTS, WHICH MIGHT BE THE RESULT OF

INDUSTRIAL OR OTHER ESPIONAGE, OR ACTIONS BY HACKERS SEEKING TO

HARM THE COMPANY, ITS PRODUCTS, OR END USERS, ARE SOMETIMES

SUCCESSFUL. WE SEEK TO DETECT AND INVESTIGATE THESE SECURITY

INCIDENTS AND TO PREVENT THEIR RECURRENCE, BUT IN SOME CASES WE

MIGHT BE UNAWARE OF AN INCIDENT OR ITS MAGNITUDE AND EFFECTS.

THE THEFT OR UNAUTHORIZED USE OR PUBLICATION OF OUR TRADE

SECRETS AND OTHER CONFIDENTIAL BUSINESS INFORMATION AS A RESULT

OF SUCH AN INCIDENT COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR COMPETITIVE

POSITION AND REDUCE MARKETPLACE ACCEPTANCE OF OUR PRODUCTS; THE

VALUE OF OUR INVESTMENT IN R&D, PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT, AND

MARKETING COULD BE REDUCED; AND THIRD PARTIES MIGHT ASSERT

AGAINST US OR OUR CUSTOMERS CLAIMS RELATED TO RESULTING LOSSES

OF CONFIDENTIAL OR PROPRIETARY INFORMATION OR END-USER DATA, OR

SYSTEM RELIABILITY. OUR BUSINESS COULD BE SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT

DISRUPTION, AND WE COULD SUFFER MONETARY AND OTHER LOSSES,

INCLUDING THE COST OF PRODUCT RECALLS AND RETURNS AND

REPUTATIONAL HARM, IN THE EVENT OF SUCH INCIDENTS AND CLAIMS.

OUR

LICENSES WITH OTHER COMPANIES AND OUR PARTICIPATION IN INDUSTRY

INITIATIVES MAY ALLOW OTHER COMPANIES, INCLUDING OUR

COMPETITORS, TO USE OUR PATENT RIGHTS.

COMPANIES IN THE SEMICONDUCTOR INDUSTRY OFTEN RELY ON THE

ABILITY TO LICENSE PATENTS FROM EACH OTHER IN ORDER TO COMPETE.

MANY OF OUR COMPETITORS HAVE BROAD LICENSES OR CROSS-LICENSES

WITH US, AND UNDER CURRENT CASE LAW, SOME OF THE LICENSES MAY

PERMIT THESE COMPETITORS TO PASS OUR PATENT RIGHTS ON TO OTHERS.

IF ONE OF THESE LICENSEES BECOMES A FOUNDRY, OUR COMPETITORS

MIGHT BE ABLE TO AVOID OUR PATENT RIGHTS IN MANUFACTURING

COMPETING PRODUCTS. IN ADDITION, OUR PARTICIPATION IN INDUSTRY

INITIATIVES MAY REQUIRE US TO LICENSE OUR PATENTS TO OTHER

COMPANIES THAT ADOPT CERTAIN INDUSTRY STANDARDS OR

SPECIFICATIONS, EVEN WHEN SUCH ORGANIZATIONS DO NOT ADOPT

STANDARDS OR SPECIFICATIONS PROPOSED BY US. AS A RESULT, OUR

PATENTS IMPLICATED BY OUR PARTICIPATION IN INDUSTRY INITIATIVES

MIGHT NOT BE AVAILABLE FOR US TO ENFORCE AGAINST OTHERS WHO

MIGHT OTHERWISE BE DEEMED TO BE INFRINGING THOSE PATENTS, OUR

COSTS OF ENFORCING OUR LICENSES OR PROTECTING OUR PATENTS MAY

INCREASE, AND THE VALUE OF OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY MAY BE

IMPAIRED.

WE

INVEST IN COMPANIES FOR STRATEGIC REASONS AND MAY NOT REALIZE A

RETURN ON OUR INVESTMENTS.

WE MAKE INVESTMENTS IN COMPANIES AROUND THE WORLD TO FURTHER OUR

STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES AND SUPPORT OUR KEY BUSINESS INITIATIVES.

SUCH INVESTMENTS INCLUDE EQUITY OR DEBT INSTRUMENTS OF PUBLIC OR

PRIVATE COMPANIES, AND MANY OF THESE INSTRUMENTS ARE

NON-MARKETABLE AT THE TIME OF OUR INITIAL INVESTMENT. THESE

COMPANIES RANGE FROM EARLY-STAGE COMPANIES THAT ARE OFTEN STILL

DEFINING THEIR STRATEGIC DIRECTION TO MORE MATURE COMPANIES WITH

ESTABLISHED REVENUE STREAMS AND BUSINESS MODELS. THE SUCCESS OF

THESE COMPANIES IS DEPENDENT ON PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT, MARKET

ACCEPTANCE, OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCY, AND OTHER KEY BUSINESS

FACTORS. THE COMPANIES IN WHICH WE INVEST MAY FAIL BECAUSE THEY

MAY NOT BE ABLE TO SECURE ADDITIONAL FUNDING, OBTAIN FAVORABLE

INVESTMENT TERMS FOR FUTURE FINANCINGS, OR PARTICIPATE IN

LIQUIDITY EVENTS SUCH AS PUBLIC OFFERINGS, MERGERS, AND PRIVATE

SALES. IF ANY OF THESE PRIVATE COMPANIES FAIL, WE COULD LOSE ALL

OR PART OF OUR INVESTMENT IN THAT COMPANY. IF WE DETERMINE THAT

AN

OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY

DECLINE IN THE FAIR VALUE EXISTS FOR AN EQUITY OR DEBT

INVESTMENT IN A PUBLIC OR PRIVATE COMPANY IN WHICH WE HAVE

INVESTED, WE WRITE DOWN THE INVESTMENT TO ITS FAIR VALUE AND

RECOGNIZE THE RELATED WRITE-DOWN AS AN INVESTMENT LOSS. WE ALSO

HAVE SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS IN COMPANIES IN THE FLASH MEMORY

MARKET SEGMENT, AND DECLINES IN THIS MARKET SEGMENT OR CHANGES

IN MANAGEMENTS PLANS WITH RESPECT TO OUR INVESTMENTS IN

THIS MARKET SEGMENT COULD RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT IMPAIRMENT

CHARGES, IMPACTING GAINS (LOSSES) ON EQUITY METHOD INVESTMENTS,

NET AND GAINS (LOSSES) ON OTHER EQUITY INVESTMENTS, NET.

WHEN THE STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES OF AN INVESTMENT HAVE BEEN

ACHIEVED, OR IF THE INVESTMENT OR BUSINESS DIVERGES FROM OUR

STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES, WE MAY DECIDE TO DISPOSE OF THE

INVESTMENT. WE MAY INCUR LOSSES ON THE DISPOSAL OF OUR

NON-MARKETABLE INVESTMENTS. ADDITIONALLY, FOR CASES IN WHICH WE

ARE REQUIRED UNDER EQUITY METHOD ACCOUNTING TO RECOGNIZE A

PROPORTIONATE SHARE OF ANOTHER COMPANYS INCOME OR LOSS,

SUCH INCOME OR LOSS MAY IMPACT OUR EARNINGS. GAINS OR LOSSES

FROM EQUITY SECURITIES COULD VARY FROM EXPECTATIONS DEPENDING ON

GAINS OR LOSSES REALIZED ON THE SALE OR EXCHANGE OF SECURITIES,

GAINS OR LOSSES FROM EQUITY METHOD INVESTMENTS, AND IMPAIRMENT

CHARGES FOR EQUITY AND OTHER INVESTMENTS.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

OUR

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COULD VARY AS A RESULT OF THE METHODS,

ESTIMATES, AND JUDGMENTS THAT WE USE IN APPLYING OUR ACCOUNTING

POLICIES.

THE METHODS, ESTIMATES, AND JUDGMENTS THAT WE USE IN APPLYING

OUR ACCOUNTING POLICIES HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON OUR RESULTS

OF OPERATIONS (SEE CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES IN

PART II, ITEM 7 OF THIS FORM

10-K).

SUCH

METHODS, ESTIMATES, AND JUDGMENTS ARE, BY THEIR NATURE, SUBJECT

TO SUBSTANTIAL RISKS, UNCERTAINTIES, AND ASSUMPTIONS, AND

FACTORS MAY ARISE OVER TIME THAT LEAD US TO CHANGE OUR METHODS,

ESTIMATES, AND JUDGMENTS. CHANGES IN THOSE METHODS, ESTIMATES,

AND JUDGMENTS COULD SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS.

DECISIONS

ABOUT THE SCOPE OF OPERATIONS OF OUR BUSINESS COULD AFFECT OUR

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

CHANGES IN THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT COULD LEAD TO CHANGES IN OUR

DECISIONS ABOUT THE SCOPE OF OPERATIONS OF OUR BUSINESS, AND

THESE CHANGES COULD RESULT IN RESTRUCTURING AND ASSET IMPAIRMENT

CHARGES. FACTORS THAT COULD AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND

FINANCIAL CONDITION WITH REGARD TO CHANGING THE SCOPE OF OUR

OPERATIONS INCLUDE.



TIMING AND EXECUTION OF PLANS AND PROGRAMS THAT MAY BE SUBJECT

TO LOCAL LABOR LAW REQUIREMENTS, INCLUDING CONSULTATION WITH

APPROPRIATE WORK COUNCILS;



CHANGES IN ASSUMPTIONS RELATED TO SEVERANCE AND POSTRETIREMENT

COSTS;



FUTURE DIVESTITURES;



NEW BUSINESS INITIATIVES AND CHANGES IN PRODUCT ROADMAP,

DEVELOPMENT, AND MANUFACTURING;



CHANGES IN EMPLOYMENT LEVELS AND TURNOVER RATES;



CHANGES IN PRODUCT DEMAND AND THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT; AND



CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF CERTAIN LONG-LIVED ASSETS.

OUR

ACQUISITIONS, DIVESTITURES, AND OTHER TRANSACTIONS COULD DISRUPT

OUR ONGOING BUSINESS AND HARM OUR RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS.

IN PURSUING OUR BUSINESS STRATEGY, WE ROUTINELY CONDUCT

DISCUSSIONS, EVALUATE OPPORTUNITIES, AND ENTER INTO AGREEMENTS

REGARDING POSSIBLE INVESTMENTS, ACQUISITIONS, DIVESTITURES, AND

OTHER TRANSACTIONS, SUCH AS JOINT VENTURES. ACQUISITIONS AND

OTHER TRANSACTIONS INVOLVE SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES AND RISKS,

INCLUDING RISKS THAT.



WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO IDENTIFY SUITABLE OPPORTUNITIES AT TERMS

ACCEPTABLE TO US;



THE TRANSACTION MAY NOT ADVANCE OUR BUSINESS STRATEGY;



WE MAY NOT REALIZE A SATISFACTORY RETURN ON THE INVESTMENT WE

MAKE;



WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO RETAIN KEY PERSONNEL OF THE ACQUIRED

BUSINESS;



WE MAY EXPERIENCE DIFFICULTY IN INTEGRATING NEW EMPLOYEES,

BUSINESS SYSTEMS, AND TECHNOLOGY;



ACQUIRED BUSINESSES MAY NOT HAVE ADEQUATE CONTROLS, PROCESSES,

AND PROCEDURES TO ENSURE COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS AND REGULATIONS

GLOBALLY, AND OUR DUE DILIGENCE PROCESS MAY NOT IDENTIFY

COMPLIANCE ISSUES OR OTHER LIABILITIES THAT ARE IN EXISTENCE AT

THE TIME OF OUR ACQUISITION;



WE MAY HAVE DIFFICULTY ENTERING INTO NEW MARKET SEGMENTS IN

WHICH WE ARE NOT EXPERIENCED; OR



WE MAY BE UNABLE TO RETAIN THE CUSTOMERS AND PARTNERS OF

ACQUIRED BUSINESSES FOLLOWING THE ACQUISITION.

WHEN WE DECIDE TO SELL ASSETS OR A BUSINESS, WE MAY ENCOUNTER

DIFFICULTY IN FINDING OR COMPLETING DIVESTITURE OPPORTUNITIES OR

ALTERNATIVE EXIT STRATEGIES ON ACCEPTABLE TERMS IN A TIMELY

MANNER, AND THE AGREED TERMS AND FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS COULD BE

RENEGOTIATED DUE TO CHANGES IN BUSINESS OR MARKET CONDITIONS.

THESE CIRCUMSTANCES COULD DELAY THE ACCOMPLISHMENT OF OUR

STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES OR CAUSE US TO INCUR ADDITIONAL EXPENSES

WITH RESPECT TO BUSINESSES THAT WE WANT TO DISPOSE OF, OR WE MAY

DISPOSE OF A BUSINESS AT A PRICE OR ON TERMS THAT ARE LESS

FAVORABLE THAN WE HAD ANTICIPATED, RESULTING IN A LOSS ON THE

TRANSACTION.

IF WE DO ENTER INTO AGREEMENTS WITH RESPECT TO ACQUISITIONS,

DIVESTITURES, OR OTHER TRANSACTIONS, WE MAY FAIL TO COMPLETE

THEM DUE TO FACTORS SUCH AS.



FAILURE TO OBTAIN REQUIRED REGULATORY OR OTHER APPROVALS;



INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY OR OTHER LITIGATION; OR



DIFFICULTIES THAT WE OR OTHER PARTIES MAY ENCOUNTER IN OBTAINING

FINANCING FOR THE TRANSACTION.

IN

ORDER TO COMPETE, WE MUST ATTRACT, RETAIN, AND MOTIVATE KEY

EMPLOYEES, AND OUR FAILURE TO DO SO COULD HARM OUR RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS.

IN ORDER TO COMPETE, WE MUST ATTRACT, RETAIN, AND MOTIVATE

EXECUTIVES AND OTHER KEY EMPLOYEES. HIRING AND RETAINING

QUALIFIED EXECUTIVES, SCIENTISTS, ENGINEERS, TECHNICAL STAFF,

AND SALES REPRESENTATIVES ARE CRITICAL TO OUR BUSINESS, AND

COMPETITION FOR EXPERIENCED EMPLOYEES IN THE SEMICONDUCTOR

INDUSTRY CAN BE INTENSE. TO HELP ATTRACT, RETAIN, AND MOTIVATE

QUALIFIED EMPLOYEES, WE USE SHARE-BASED INCENTIVE AWARDS SUCH AS

NON-VESTED SHARE UNITS (RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS) AND EMPLOYEE

STOCK OPTIONS. IF THE VALUE OF SUCH STOCK AWARDS DOES NOT

APPRECIATE AS MEASURED BY THE PERFORMANCE OF THE PRICE OF OUR

COMMON STOCK, OR IF OUR SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION OTHERWISE

CEASES TO BE VIEWED AS A VALUABLE BENEFIT, OUR ABILITY TO

ATTRACT, RETAIN, AND MOTIVATE EMPLOYEES COULD BE WEAKENED, WHICH

COULD HARM OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

OUR

FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH APPLICABLE ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND

REGULATIONS WORLDWIDE COULD HARM OUR BUSINESS AND RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS.

THE MANUFACTURING AND ASSEMBLING AND TESTING OF OUR PRODUCTS

REQUIRE THE USE OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS THAT ARE SUBJECT TO A

BROAD ARRAY OF EHS LAWS AND REGULATIONS. OUR FAILURE TO COMPLY

WITH ANY OF THOSE APPLICABLE LAWS OR REGULATIONS COULD RESULT IN.



REGULATORY PENALTIES, FINES, AND LEGAL LIABILITIES;



SUSPENSION OF PRODUCTION;



ALTERATION OF OUR FABRICATION AND ASSEMBLY AND TEST PROCESSES;

AND



CURTAILMENT OF OUR OPERATIONS OR SALES.

IN ADDITION, OUR FAILURE TO MANAGE THE USE, TRANSPORTATION,

EMISSIONS, DISCHARGE, STORAGE, RECYCLING, OR DISPOSAL OF

HAZARDOUS MATERIALS COULD SUBJECT US TO INCREASED COSTS OR

FUTURE LIABILITIES. EXISTING AND FUTURE ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND

REGULATIONS COULD ALSO REQUIRE US TO ACQUIRE POLLUTION ABATEMENT

OR REMEDIATION EQUIPMENT, MODIFY OUR PRODUCT DESIGNS, OR INCUR

OTHER EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH SUCH LAWS AND REGULATIONS. MANY

NEW MATERIALS THAT WE ARE EVALUATING FOR USE IN OUR OPERATIONS

MAY BE SUBJECT TO REGULATION UNDER EXISTING OR FUTURE

ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS THAT MAY RESTRICT OUR USE OF

ONE OR MORE OF SUCH MATERIALS IN OUR MANUFACTURING, ASSEMBLY AND

TEST PROCESSES, OR PRODUCTS. ANY OF THESE RESTRICTIONS COULD

HARM OUR BUSINESS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS BY INCREASING OUR

EXPENSES OR REQUIRING US TO ALTER OUR MANUFACTURING AND ASSEMBLY

AND TEST PROCESSES.

CLIMATE

CHANGE POSES BOTH REGULATORY AND PHYSICAL RISKS THAT COULD HARM

OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR AFFECT THE WAY WE CONDUCT OUR

BUSINESS.

IN ADDITION TO THE POSSIBLE DIRECT ECONOMIC IMPACT THAT CLIMATE

CHANGE COULD HAVE ON US, CLIMATE CHANGE MITIGATION PROGRAMS AND

REGULATIONS CAN INCREASE OUR COSTS. FOR EXAMPLE, THE COST OF

PERFLUOROCOMPOUNDS (PFCS), A GAS THAT WE USE IN MANUFACTURING,

COULD INCREASE OVER TIME UNDER SOME CLIMATE-CHANGE-FOCUSED

EMISSIONS TRADING PROGRAMS THAT MAY BE IMPOSED BY GOVERNMENT

REGULATION. IF THE USE OF PFCS IS PROHIBITED, WE WOULD NEED TO

OBTAIN SUBSTITUTE MATERIALS THAT MAY COST MORE OR BE LESS

AVAILABLE FOR OUR MANUFACTURING OPERATIONS. IN ADDITION, AIR

QUALITY PERMIT REQUIREMENTS FOR OUR MANUFACTURING OPERATIONS

COULD BECOME MORE BURDENSOME AND CAUSE DELAYS IN OUR ABILITY TO

MODIFY OR BUILD ADDITIONAL MANUFACTURING CAPACITY. UNDER THE

RECENTLY ADOPTED GREENHOUSE GAS REGULATIONS IN THE U.S., MANY OF

OUR MANUFACTURING FACILITIES WILL BECOME MAJOR

SOURCES UNDER THE CLEAN AIR ACT IN 2011. AT A MINIMUM, THIS

CHANGE IN STATUS WILL RESULT IN SOME UNCERTAINTY AS THE EPA

ADOPTS GUIDANCE ON IMPLEMENTATION OF ITS GREENHOUSE GAS

REGULATIONS. DUE TO THE DYNAMIC NATURE OF OUR SEMICONDUCTOR

MANUFACTURING OPERATIONS, IT IS LIKELY THESE NEW REGULATIONS

WILL RESULT IN INCREASED COSTS FOR OUR U.S. OPERATIONS. THESE

COST INCREASES COULD BE ASSOCIATED WITH NEW AIR POLLUTION

CONTROL REQUIREMENTS, AND INCREASED OR NEW MONITORING,

RECORDKEEPING, AND REPORTING OF GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS. WE

ALSO SEE THE POTENTIAL FOR HIGHER ENERGY COSTS DRIVEN BY CLIMATE

CHANGE REGULATIONS. OUR COSTS COULD INCREASE IF UTILITY

COMPANIES PASS ON THEIR COSTS, SUCH AS THOSE ASSOCIATED WITH

CARBON TAXES, EMISSION CAP AND TRADE PROGRAMS, OR RENEWABLE

PORTFOLIO STANDARDS. WHILE WE MAINTAIN BUSINESS RECOVERY PLANS

THAT ARE INTENDED TO ALLOW US TO RECOVER FROM NATURAL DISASTERS

OR OTHER EVENTS THAT CAN BE DISRUPTIVE TO OUR BUSINESS, WE

CANNOT BE SURE THAT OUR PLANS WILL FULLY PROTECT US FROM ALL

SUCH DISASTERS OR EVENTS. MANY OF OUR OPERATIONS ARE LOCATED IN

SEMI-ARID REGIONS, SUCH AS ISRAEL AND THE SOUTHWESTERN U.S. SOME

SCENARIOS PREDICT THAT THESE REGIONS MAY BECOME EVEN MORE

VULNERABLE TO PROLONGED DROUGHTS DUE TO CLIMATE CHANGE.

CHANGES

IN OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE MAY HARM OUR RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS.

A NUMBER OF FACTORS MAY INCREASE OUR FUTURE EFFECTIVE TAX RATES,
