ITEM 1A.   RISK FACTORS

FLUCTUATIONS IN DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS MAY ADVERSELY

AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS.

IF DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS FLUCTUATES, OUR REVENUE AND GROSS

MARGIN COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED. IMPORTANT FACTORS THAT COULD

CAUSE DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS TO FLUCTUATE INCLUDE.



CHANGES IN CUSTOMER PRODUCT NEEDS;



CHANGES IN THE LEVEL OF CUSTOMERS INVENTORY;



CHANGES IN BUSINESS AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, INCLUDING A

DOWNTURN IN THE SEMICONDUCTOR INDUSTRY;



COMPETITIVE PRESSURES FROM COMPANIES THAT HAVE COMPETING

PRODUCTS, CHIP ARCHITECTURES AND MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGIES;



STRATEGIC ACTIONS TAKEN BY OUR COMPETITORS; AND



MARKET ACCEPTANCE OF OUR PRODUCTS.

IF DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS IS REDUCED, OUR MANUFACTURING AND/OR

ASSEMBLY AND TEST CAPACITY COULD BE UNDER-UTILIZED, AND WE MAY

BE REQUIRED TO RECORD AN IMPAIRMENT ON OUR LONG-LIVED ASSETS

INCLUDING FACILITIES AND EQUIPMENT, AS WELL AS INTANGIBLE

ASSETS, WHICH WOULD INCREASE OUR EXPENSES. IN ADDITION, FACTORY

PLANNING DECISIONS MAY CAUSE US TO RECORD ACCELERATED

DEPRECIATION. IN THE LONG TERM, IF DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS

INCREASES, WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO ADD MANUFACTURING AND/OR

ASSEMBLY AND TEST CAPACITY FAST ENOUGH TO MEET MARKET DEMAND.

THESE CHANGES IN DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS, AND CHANGES IN OUR

CUSTOMERS PRODUCT NEEDS, COULD HAVE A VARIETY OF NEGATIVE

EFFECTS ON OUR COMPETITIVE POSITION AND OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS,

AND, IN CERTAIN CASES, MAY REDUCE OUR REVENUE, INCREASE OUR

COSTS, LOWER OUR GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE, OR REQUIRE US TO

RECOGNIZE AND RECORD IMPAIRMENTS OF OUR ASSETS.

THE SEMICONDUCTOR INDUSTRY AND OUR OPERATIONS ARE

CHARACTERIZED BY A HIGH PERCENTAGE OF COSTS THAT ARE FIXED OR

OTHERWISE DIFFICULT TO REDUCE IN THE SHORT TERM, AND BY PRODUCT

DEMAND THAT IS HIGHLY VARIABLE AND IS SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT

DOWNTURNS THAT MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

THE SEMICONDUCTOR INDUSTRY AND OUR OPERATIONS ARE CHARACTERIZED

BY HIGH COSTS, SUCH AS THOSE RELATED TO FACILITY CONSTRUCTION

AND EQUIPMENT, RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, AND EMPLOYMENT AND

TRAINING OF A HIGHLY SKILLED WORKFORCE, THAT ARE EITHER FIXED OR

DIFFICULT TO REDUCE IN THE SHORT TERM. AT THE SAME TIME, DEMAND

FOR OUR PRODUCTS IS HIGHLY VARIABLE AND HAS EXPERIENCED

DOWNTURNS, OFTEN IN CONNECTION WITH MATURING PRODUCT CYCLES AND

DOWNTURNS IN GENERAL ECONOMIC MARKET CONDITIONS. THESE DOWNTURNS

HAVE BEEN CHARACTERIZED BY REDUCED PRODUCT DEMAND, MANUFACTURING

OVERCAPACITY, HIGH INVENTORY LEVELS AND DECREASED AVERAGE

SELLING PRICES. THE COMBINATION OF THESE FACTORS MAY CAUSE OUR

REVENUE, GROSS MARGIN, CASH FLOW AND PROFITABILITY TO VARY

SIGNIFICANTLY BOTH IN THE SHORT TERM AND OVER THE LONG TERM.

WE OPERATE IN INTENSELY COMPETITIVE INDUSTRIES, AND OUR

FAILURE TO RESPOND QUICKLY TO TECHNOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENTS AND

INCORPORATE NEW FEATURES INTO OUR PRODUCTS COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE

EFFECT ON OUR ABILITY TO COMPETE.

WE OPERATE IN INTENSELY COMPETITIVE INDUSTRIES THAT EXPERIENCE

RAPID TECHNOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENTS, CHANGES IN INDUSTRY STANDARDS,

CHANGES IN CUSTOMER REQUIREMENTS, AND FREQUENT NEW PRODUCT

INTRODUCTIONS AND IMPROVEMENTS. IF WE ARE UNABLE TO RESPOND

QUICKLY AND SUCCESSFULLY TO THESE DEVELOPMENTS, WE MAY LOSE OUR

COMPETITIVE POSITION, AND OUR PRODUCTS OR TECHNOLOGIES MAY

BECOME UNCOMPETITIVE OR OBSOLETE. TO COMPETE SUCCESSFULLY, WE

MUST MAINTAIN A SUCCESSFUL R&D EFFORT, DEVELOP NEW PRODUCTS

AND PRODUCTION PROCESSES, AND IMPROVE OUR EXISTING PRODUCTS AND

PROCESSES AT THE SAME PACE OR AHEAD OF OUR COMPETITORS. WE MAY

NOT BE ABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY DEVELOP AND MARKET THESE NEW

PRODUCTS; THE PRODUCTS WE INVEST IN AND DEVELOP MAY NOT BE WELL

RECEIVED BY CUSTOMERS; AND PRODUCTS DEVELOPED AND NEW

TECHNOLOGIES OFFERED BY OTHERS MAY AFFECT THE DEMAND FOR OUR

PRODUCTS. THESE TYPES OF EVENTS COULD HAVE A VARIETY OF NEGATIVE

EFFECTS ON OUR COMPETITIVE POSITION AND OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS,

SUCH AS REDUCING OUR REVENUE, INCREASING OUR COSTS, LOWERING OUR

GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE, AND REQUIRING US TO RECOGNIZE AND

RECORD IMPAIRMENTS OF OUR ASSETS.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

FLUCTUATIONS IN THE MIX OF PRODUCTS SOLD MAY ADVERSELY

AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS.

BECAUSE OF THE WIDE PRICE DIFFERENCES AMONG MOBILE, DESKTOP AND

SERVER MICROPROCESSORS, THE MIX AND TYPES OF PERFORMANCE

CAPABILITIES OF MICROPROCESSORS SOLD AFFECT THE AVERAGE SELLING

PRICE OF OUR PRODUCTS AND HAVE A SUBSTANTIAL IMPACT ON OUR

REVENUE. OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS ALSO DEPEND IN PART ON THE MIX OF

OTHER PRODUCTS WE SELL, SUCH AS CHIPSETS, FLASH MEMORY AND OTHER

SEMICONDUCTOR PRODUCTS. IN ADDITION, MORE RECENTLY INTRODUCED

PRODUCTS TEND TO HAVE HIGHER ASSOCIATED COSTS BECAUSE OF INITIAL

OVERALL DEVELOPMENT COSTS AND HIGHER

START-UP

COSTS.

FLUCTUATIONS IN THE MIX AND TYPES OF OUR PRODUCTS MAY ALSO

AFFECT THE EXTENT TO WHICH WE ARE ABLE TO RECOVER OUR FIXED

COSTS AND INVESTMENTS THAT ARE ASSOCIATED WITH A PARTICULAR

PRODUCT, AND AS A RESULT CAN NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR FINANCIAL

RESULTS.

OUR GLOBAL OPERATIONS SUBJECT US TO RISKS THAT MAY

NEGATIVELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL

CONDITION.

WE HAVE SALES OFFICES AND RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT,

MANUFACTURING, AND ASSEMBLY AND TEST FACILITIES IN MANY

COUNTRIES, AND AS A RESULT, WE ARE SUBJECT TO RISKS ASSOCIATED

WITH DOING BUSINESS GLOBALLY. OUR GLOBAL OPERATIONS MAY BE

SUBJECT TO RISKS THAT MAY LIMIT OUR ABILITY TO MANUFACTURE,

ASSEMBLE AND TEST, DESIGN, DEVELOP OR SELL PRODUCTS IN

PARTICULAR COUNTRIES, WHICH COULD IN TURN HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT

ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION, INCLUDING.



HEALTH CONCERNS;



NATURAL DISASTERS;



INEFFICIENT AND LIMITED INFRASTRUCTURE AND DISRUPTIONS, SUCH AS

LARGE-SCALE OUTAGES OR INTERRUPTIONS OF SERVICE FROM UTILITIES

OR TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROVIDERS AND SUPPLY CHAIN INTERRUPTIONS;



DIFFERING EMPLOYMENT PRACTICES AND LABOR ISSUES;



LOCAL BUSINESS AND CULTURAL FACTORS THAT DIFFER FROM OUR NORMAL

STANDARDS AND PRACTICES;



REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS AND PROHIBITIONS THAT DIFFER BETWEEN

JURISDICTIONS;



SECURITY CONCERNS, INCLUDING CRIME, POLITICAL INSTABILITY,

TERRORIST ACTIVITY, ARMED CONFLICT AND CIVIL OR MILITARY

UNREST; AND



RESTRICTIONS ON OUR OPERATIONS BY GOVERNMENTS SEEKING TO SUPPORT

LOCAL INDUSTRIES, NATIONALIZATION OF OUR OPERATIONS AND

RESTRICTIONS ON OUR ABILITY TO REPATRIATE EARNINGS.

IN ADDITION, ALTHOUGH MOST OF OUR PRODUCTS ARE PRICED AND PAID

FOR IN U.S. DOLLARS, A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF CERTAIN TYPES

OF EXPENSES, SUCH AS PAYROLL, UTILITIES, TAX AND MARKETING

EXPENSES, ARE PAID IN LOCAL CURRENCIES. FLUCTUATIONS IN THE RATE

OF EXCHANGE BETWEEN THE U.S. DOLLAR AND THE CURRENCIES OF

OTHER COUNTRIES IN WHICH WE CONDUCT BUSINESS, AND CHANGES IN

CURRENCY CONTROLS WITH RESPECT TO SUCH COUNTRIES, COULD

NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR BUSINESS, OPERATING RESULTS AND FINANCIAL

CONDITION BY RESULTING IN LOWER REVENUE OR INCREASED EXPENSES IN

SUCH COUNTRIES. IN ADDITION, CHANGES IN TARIFF AND IMPORT

REGULATIONS AND TO U.S. AND

NON-U.S.

MONETARY

POLICIES MAY ALSO NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR REVENUE IN THOSE

AFFECTED COUNTRIES. VARYING TAX RATES IN DIFFERENT JURISDICTIONS

COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR OVERALL TAX RATE.

FAILURE TO MEET OUR PRODUCTION TARGETS, RESULTING IN

UNDERSUPPLY OR OVERSUPPLY OF PRODUCTS, MAY ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR

BUSINESS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

MANUFACTURING AND ASSEMBLY AND TEST OF INTEGRATED CIRCUITS IS A

COMPLEX PROCESS. DISRUPTIONS IN THIS PROCESS CAN RESULT FROM

DIFFICULTIES IN OUR DEVELOPMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION OF NEW

PROCESSES, ERRORS AND INTERRUPTIONS IN THE PROCESSES, DEFECTS IN

MATERIALS AND DISRUPTIONS IN OUR SUPPLY OF MATERIALS OR

RESOURCES, ALL OF WHICH COULD AFFECT THE TIMING OF PRODUCTION

RAMPS AND YIELDS. FURTHERMORE, WE MAY NOT BE SUCCESSFUL OR

EFFICIENT IN DEVELOPING OR IMPLEMENTING NEW PRODUCTION

PROCESSES. THE OCCURRENCE OF ANY OF THE FOREGOING MAY RESULT IN

OUR FAILURE TO INCREASE PRODUCTION AS DESIRED, RESULTING IN

HIGHER COSTS OR SUBSTANTIAL DECREASES IN YIELDS, WHICH COULD

IMPACT OUR ABILITY TO PRODUCE SUFFICIENT VOLUME TO MEET SPECIFIC

PRODUCT DEMAND. FURTHERMORE, THE UNAVAILABILITY OR REDUCED

AVAILABILITY OF CERTAIN PRODUCTS COULD MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT TO

IMPLEMENT OUR PLATFORM STRATEGY. WE MAY ALSO EXPERIENCE

INCREASES IN YIELDS. A SUBSTANTIAL INCREASE IN YIELDS COULD

RESULT IN HIGHER INVENTORY LEVELS AND THE POSSIBILITY OF

RESULTING EXCESS CAPACITY CHARGES AS WE SLOW PRODUCTION TO

REDUCE INVENTORY LEVELS. IN ADDITION, HIGHER YIELDS, AS WELL AS

OTHER FACTORS, CAN DECREASE OVERALL UNIT COSTS AND MAY CAUSE US

TO REVALUE OUR EXISTING INVENTORY ON CERTAIN PRODUCTS TO THEIR

LOWER REPLACEMENT COST, WHICH WOULD IMPACT OUR GROSS MARGIN IN

THE QUARTERS IN WHICH THIS REVALUATION OCCURS. THE OCCURRENCE OF

ANY OF THESE EVENTS COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR BUSINESS AND

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

WE MAY HAVE DIFFICULTIES OBTAINING THE RESOURCES OR

PRODUCTS WE NEED FOR MANUFACTURING OR ASSEMBLING OUR PRODUCTS OR

OPERATING OTHER ASPECTS OF OUR BUSINESS, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY

AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO MEET DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS AND MAY

INCREASE OUR COSTS.

WE HAVE THOUSANDS OF SUPPLIERS PROVIDING VARIOUS MATERIALS THAT

WE USE IN PRODUCTION OF OUR PRODUCTS AND OTHER ASPECTS OF OUR

BUSINESS, AND WE SEEK, WHERE POSSIBLE, TO HAVE SEVERAL SOURCES

OF SUPPLY FOR ALL OF THESE MATERIALS. HOWEVER, WE MAY RELY ON A

SINGLE OR A LIMITED NUMBER OF SUPPLIERS, OR UPON SUPPLIERS IN A

SINGLE COUNTRY, FOR THESE MATERIALS. THE INABILITY OF SUCH

SUPPLIERS TO DELIVER ADEQUATE SUPPLIES OF PRODUCTION MATERIALS

OR OTHER SUPPLIES COULD DISRUPT OUR PRODUCTION PROCESS OR COULD

MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR US TO IMPLEMENT OUR PLATFORM

STRATEGY. IN ADDITION, PRODUCTION COULD BE DISRUPTED BY THE

UNAVAILABILITY OF THE RESOURCES USED IN PRODUCTION SUCH AS

WATER, SILICON, ELECTRICITY AND GASES. THE UNAVAILABILITY OR

REDUCED AVAILABILITY OF THE MATERIALS OR RESOURCES WE USE IN OUR

BUSINESS MAY REQUIRE US TO REDUCE PRODUCTION OF PRODUCTS OR MAY

REQUIRE US TO INCUR ADDITIONAL COSTS IN ORDER TO OBTAIN AN

ADEQUATE SUPPLY OF THESE MATERIALS OR RESOURCES. THE OCCURRENCE

OF ANY OF THESE EVENTS COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR BUSINESS AND

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

COSTS RELATED TO PRODUCT DEFECTS AND ERRATA MAY HAVE AN

ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND BUSINESS.

COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH UNEXPECTED PRODUCT DEFECTS AND ERRATA

(DEVIATIONS FROM PUBLISHED SPECIFICATIONS) INCLUDE, FOR EXAMPLE,

THE COSTS OF.



WRITING DOWN THE VALUE OF INVENTORY OF DEFECTIVE PRODUCTS;



DISPOSING OF DEFECTIVE PRODUCTS THAT CANNOT BE FIXED;



RECALLING DEFECTIVE PRODUCTS THAT HAVE BEEN SHIPPED TO CUSTOMERS;



PROVIDING PRODUCT REPLACEMENTS FOR OR MODIFICATIONS TO DEFECTIVE

PRODUCTS; AND



DEFENDING AGAINST LITIGATION RELATED TO DEFECTIVE PRODUCTS.

THESE COSTS COULD BE SUBSTANTIAL AND MAY THEREFORE INCREASE OUR

EXPENSES AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR GROSS MARGIN. IN ADDITION, OUR

REPUTATION WITH OUR CUSTOMERS OR END USERS OF OUR PRODUCTS COULD

BE DAMAGED AS A RESULT OF SUCH PRODUCT DEFECTS AND ERRATA, AND

THE DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS COULD BE REDUCED. THESE FACTORS

COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS AND THE PROSPECTS

FOR OUR BUSINESS.

WE MAY BE SUBJECT TO CLAIMS OF INFRINGEMENT OF THIRD-PARTY

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR

BUSINESS.

FROM TIME TO TIME, THIRD PARTIES MAY ASSERT AGAINST US OR OUR

CUSTOMERS ALLEGED PATENT, COPYRIGHT, TRADEMARK AND OTHER

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS TO TECHNOLOGIES THAT ARE IMPORTANT

TO OUR BUSINESS. WE MAY BE SUBJECT TO INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

INFRINGEMENT CLAIMS FROM CERTAIN INDIVIDUALS AND COMPANIES WHO

HAVE ACQUIRED PATENT PORTFOLIOS FOR THE SOLE PURPOSE OF

ASSERTING SUCH CLAIMS AGAINST OTHER COMPANIES. ANY CLAIMS THAT

OUR PRODUCTS OR PROCESSES INFRINGE THE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

RIGHTS OF OTHERS, REGARDLESS OF THE MERIT OR RESOLUTION OF SUCH

CLAIMS, COULD CAUSE US TO INCUR SIGNIFICANT COSTS IN RESPONDING

TO, DEFENDING AND RESOLVING SUCH CLAIMS, AND MAY DIVERT THE

EFFORTS AND ATTENTION OF OUR MANAGEMENT AND TECHNICAL PERSONNEL

AWAY FROM OUR BUSINESS. AS A RESULT OF SUCH INTELLECTUAL

PROPERTY INFRINGEMENT CLAIMS, WE COULD BE REQUIRED TO.



PAY THIRD-PARTY INFRINGEMENT CLAIMS;



DISCONTINUE MANUFACTURING, USING OR SELLING THE INFRINGING

PRODUCTS;



DISCONTINUE USING THE INFRINGING TECHNOLOGY OR PROCESSES;



DEVELOP NON-INFRINGING TECHNOLOGY, WHICH COULD BE TIME-CONSUMING

AND COSTLY OR MAY NOT BE POSSIBLE; OR



LICENSE TECHNOLOGY FROM THE THIRD PARTY CLAIMING INFRINGEMENT,

WHICH LICENSE MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE ON COMMERCIALLY REASONABLE

TERMS OR AT ALL.

THE OCCURRENCE OF ANY OF THE FOREGOING COULD RESULT IN

UNEXPECTED EXPENSES OR REQUIRE US TO RECOGNIZE AN IMPAIRMENT OF

OUR ASSETS, WHICH WOULD REDUCE THE VALUE OF OUR ASSETS AND

INCREASE EXPENSES. IN ADDITION, IF WE ALTER OR DISCONTINUE OUR

PRODUCTION OF AFFECTED ITEMS, OUR REVENUE COULD BE NEGATIVELY

IMPACTED.

WE MAY BE SUBJECT TO LITIGATION PROCEEDINGS THAT COULD

ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS.

IN ADDITION TO THE LITIGATION RISKS MENTIONED ABOVE, WE MAY BE

SUBJECT TO LEGAL CLAIMS OR REGULATORY MATTERS INVOLVING

STOCKHOLDER, CONSUMER, ANTITRUST AND OTHER ISSUES. AS DESCRIBED

IN LEGAL PROCEEDINGS IN PART I, ITEM 3 OF

THIS FORM 10-K, WE ARE CURRENTLY ENGAGED IN A NUMBER OF

LITIGATION MATTERS. LITIGATION IS SUBJECT TO INHERENT

UNCERTAINTIES, AND UNFAVORABLE RULINGS COULD OCCUR. AN

UNFAVORABLE RULING COULD INCLUDE MONEY DAMAGES OR, IN CASES FOR

WHICH INJUNCTIVE RELIEF IS SOUGHT, AN INJUNCTION PROHIBITING

INTEL FROM MANUFACTURING OR SELLING ONE OR MORE PRODUCTS. WERE

AN UNFAVORABLE RULING TO OCCUR, THERE EXISTS THE POSSIBILITY OF

A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON BUSINESS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

FOR THE PERIOD IN WHICH THE RULING OCCURRED OR FUTURE PERIODS.

WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO ENFORCE OR PROTECT OUR INTELLECTUAL

PROPERTY RIGHTS, WHICH MAY HARM OUR ABILITY TO COMPETE AND

ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS.

OUR ABILITY TO ENFORCE OUR PATENTS, COPYRIGHTS, SOFTWARE

LICENSES AND OTHER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY IS SUBJECT TO GENERAL

LITIGATION RISKS, AS WELL AS UNCERTAINTY AS TO THE

ENFORCEABILITY OF OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS IN VARIOUS

COUNTRIES. WHEN WE SEEK TO ENFORCE OUR RIGHTS, WE ARE OFTEN

SUBJECT TO CLAIMS THAT THE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHT IS

INVALID, IS OTHERWISE NOT ENFORCEABLE OR IS LICENSED TO THE

PARTY AGAINST WHOM WE ARE ASSERTING A CLAIM. IN ADDITION, OUR

ASSERTION OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS OFTEN RESULTS IN THE

OTHER PARTY SEEKING TO ASSERT ALLEGED INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

RIGHTS OF ITS OWN AGAINST US, WHICH MAY ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR

BUSINESS IN THE MANNER DISCUSSED ABOVE. IF WE ARE NOT ULTIMATELY

SUCCESSFUL IN DEFENDING OURSELVES AGAINST THESE CLAIMS IN

LITIGATION, WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO SELL A PARTICULAR PRODUCT OR

FAMILY OF PRODUCTS, DUE TO AN INJUNCTION, OR WE MAY HAVE TO PAY

MATERIAL AMOUNTS OF DAMAGES, WHICH COULD IN TURN NEGATIVELY

AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. IN ADDITION, GOVERNMENTS MAY

ADOPT REGULATIONS OR COURTS MAY RENDER DECISIONS REQUIRING

COMPULSORY LICENSING OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY TO OTHERS, OR

GOVERNMENTS MAY REQUIRE THAT PRODUCTS MEET SPECIFIED STANDARDS

THAT SERVE TO FAVOR LOCAL COMPANIES. OUR INABILITY TO ENFORCE

OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES MAY

NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR COMPETITIVE POSITION AND OUR BUSINESS.

20

TABLE OF CONTENTS

OUR LICENSES WITH OTHER COMPANIES AND OUR PARTICIPATION IN

INDUSTRY INITIATIVES MAY ALLOW OTHER COMPANIES, INCLUDING

COMPETITORS, TO USE OUR PATENT RIGHTS.

COMPANIES IN THE SEMICONDUCTOR INDUSTRY OFTEN RELY ON THE

ABILITY TO LICENSE PATENTS FROM EACH OTHER IN ORDER TO COMPETE.

MANY OF OUR COMPETITORS HAVE BROAD LICENSES OR CROSS-LICENSES

WITH US, AND UNDER CURRENT CASE LAW, SOME OF THESE LICENSES MAY

PERMIT THESE COMPETITORS TO PASS OUR PATENT RIGHTS ON TO OTHERS.

IF ONE OF THESE LICENSEES BECOMES A FOUNDRY, OUR COMPETITORS

MIGHT BE ABLE TO AVOID OUR PATENT RIGHTS IN MANUFACTURING

COMPETING PRODUCTS. IN ADDITION, OUR PARTICIPATION IN INDUSTRY

INITIATIVES MAY REQUIRE US TO LICENSE OUR PATENTS TO OTHER

COMPANIES THAT ADOPT CERTAIN INDUSTRY STANDARDS OR

SPECIFICATIONS, EVEN WHEN SUCH ORGANIZATIONS DO NOT ADOPT

STANDARDS OR SPECIFICATIONS PROPOSED BY US. AS A RESULT, OUR

PATENTS IMPLICATED BY OUR PARTICIPATION IN INDUSTRY INITIATIVES

MIGHT NOT BE AVAILABLE FOR US TO ENFORCE AGAINST OTHERS WHO

MIGHT OTHERWISE BE DEEMED TO BE INFRINGING THOSE PATENTS, OUR

COSTS OF ENFORCING OUR LICENSES OR PROTECTING OUR PATENTS MAY

INCREASE, AND THE VALUE OF OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY MAY BE

IMPAIRED.

IN ORDER TO COMPETE, WE MUST ATTRACT, RETAIN AND MOTIVATE

KEY EMPLOYEES, AND OUR FAILURE TO DO SO COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE

EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

IN ORDER TO COMPETE, WE MUST ATTRACT, RETAIN AND MOTIVATE

EXECUTIVES AND OTHER KEY EMPLOYEES, INCLUDING THOSE IN

MANAGERIAL, TECHNICAL, SALES, MARKETING AND SUPPORT POSITIONS.

HIRING AND RETAINING QUALIFIED EXECUTIVES, SCIENTISTS,

ENGINEERS, TECHNICAL STAFF AND SALES REPRESENTATIVES ARE

CRITICAL TO OUR BUSINESS, AND COMPETITION FOR EXPERIENCED

EMPLOYEES IN THE SEMICONDUCTOR INDUSTRY CAN BE INTENSE. TO

ATTRACT, RETAIN AND MOTIVATE QUALIFIED EMPLOYEES, WE RELY

HEAVILY ON STOCK-BASED INCENTIVE AWARDS SUCH AS EMPLOYEE STOCK

OPTIONS AND RESTRICTED STOCK. IF THE VALUE OF SUCH STOCK AWARDS

DOES NOT APPRECIATE AS MEASURED BY THE PERFORMANCE OF THE PRICE

OF OUR COMMON STOCK AND/OR IF OUR OTHER STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION

OTHERWISE CEASES TO BE VIEWED AS A VALUABLE BENEFIT, OUR ABILITY

TO ATTRACT, RETAIN AND MOTIVATE OUR EMPLOYEES COULD BE ADVERSELY

IMPACTED, WHICH COULD NEGATIVELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS AND/OR REQUIRE US TO INCREASE THE AMOUNT WE EXPEND ON

CASH AND OTHER FORMS OF COMPENSATION. IN ADDITION, OUR ADOPTION

OF STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS (SFAS)

NO. 123 (REVISED 2004), SHARE-BASED PAYMENT,

DURING OUR FIRST QUARTER OF 2006 WILL RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT

ADDITIONAL COMPENSATION EXPENSE COMPARED TO PRIOR PERIODS.

OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COULD VARY AS A RESULT OF THE

METHODS, ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS WE USE IN APPLYING OUR

ACCOUNTING POLICIES.

THE METHODS, ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS WE USE IN APPLYING OUR

ACCOUNTING POLICIES HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON OUR RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS (SEE CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES IN

PART II, ITEM 7 OF THIS

FORM

10-K).

SUCH

METHODS, ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS ARE, BY THEIR NATURE, SUBJECT

TO SUBSTANTIAL RISKS, UNCERTAINTIES AND ASSUMPTIONS, AND FACTORS

MAY ARISE OVER TIME THAT LEAD US TO CHANGE OUR METHODS,

ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS. CHANGES IN THOSE METHODS, ESTIMATES AND

JUDGMENTS COULD SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

IN PARTICULAR, BEGINNING IN OUR FIRST QUARTER OF 2006, THE

CALCULATION OF SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE UNDER

SFAS NO. 123(R) WILL REQUIRE US TO USE VALUATION

METHODOLOGIES (WHICH WERE NOT DEVELOPED FOR USE IN VALUING

EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTIONS) AND A NUMBER OF ASSUMPTIONS, ESTIMATES

AND CONCLUSIONS REGARDING MATTERS SUCH AS EXPECTED FORFEITURES,

EXPECTED VOLATILITY OF OUR SHARE PRICE, THE EXPECTED DIVIDEND

RATE WITH RESPECT TO OUR COMMON STOCK AND THE EXERCISE BEHAVIOR

OF OUR EMPLOYEES. FURTHERMORE, THERE ARE NO MEANS, UNDER

APPLICABLE ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES, TO COMPARE AND ADJUST OUR

EXPENSE IF AND WHEN WE LEARN OF ADDITIONAL INFORMATION THAT MAY

AFFECT THE ESTIMATES THAT WE PREVIOUSLY MADE, WITH THE EXCEPTION

OF CHANGES IN EXPECTED FORFEITURES OF SHARE-BASED AWARDS.

FACTORS MAY ARISE OVER TIME THAT LEAD US TO CHANGE OUR ESTIMATES

AND ASSUMPTIONS WITH RESPECT TO FUTURE SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION

ARRANGEMENTS, RESULTING IN VARIABILITY IN OUR SHARE-BASED

COMPENSATION EXPENSE OVER TIME. CHANGES IN FORECASTED

SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE COULD IMPACT OUR GROSS MARGIN

PERCENTAGE; RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES; MARKETING,

GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES; AND OUR TAX RATE.

OUR FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH APPLICABLE ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS

AND REGULATIONS WORLDWIDE COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR BUSINESS

AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

THE MANUFACTURE, ASSEMBLY AND TESTING OF OUR PRODUCTS REQUIRE

THE USE OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS THAT ARE SUBJECT TO A BROAD ARRAY

OF ENVIRONMENTAL, HEALTH AND SAFETY LAWS AND REGULATIONS. OUR

FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH ANY OF THESE APPLICABLE LAWS OR

REGULATIONS COULD RESULT IN.



REGULATORY PENALTIES, FINES AND LEGAL LIABILITIES;



SUSPENSION OF PRODUCTION;



ALTERATION OF OUR FABRICATION AND ASSEMBLY AND TEST

PROCESSES; OR



CURTAILMENT OF OUR OPERATIONS OR SALES.

IN ADDITION, OUR FAILURE TO PROPERLY MANAGE THE USE,

TRANSPORTATION, EMISSION, DISCHARGE, STORAGE, RECYCLING OR

DISPOSAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS COULD SUBJECT US TO INCREASED

COSTS OR FUTURE LIABILITIES. EXISTING AND FUTURE ENVIRONMENTAL

LAWS AND REGULATIONS COULD ALSO REQUIRE US TO ACQUIRE POLLUTION

ABATEMENT OR REMEDIATION EQUIPMENT, MODIFY OUR PRODUCT DESIGNS

OR INCUR OTHER EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH SUCH LAWS AND

REGULATIONS. MANY NEW MATERIALS THAT WE ARE EVALUATING FOR USE

IN OUR OPERATIONS MAY BE SUBJECT TO REGULATION UNDER EXISTING OR

FUTURE ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS THAT MAY RESTRICT OUR

USE OF CERTAIN MATERIALS IN OUR MANUFACTURING, ASSEMBLY AND TEST

PROCESSES OR PRODUCTS. ANY OF THESE CONSEQUENCES COULD ADVERSELY

IMPACT OUR BUSINESS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS BY INCREASING OUR

EXPENSES AND/OR REQUIRING US TO ALTER OUR MANUFACTURING

PROCESSES.

21

TABLE OF CONTENTS

CHANGES IN OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE MAY HAVE AN ADVERSE

EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

OUR FUTURE EFFECTIVE TAX RATES MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY A

NUMBER OF FACTORS INCLUDING.



THE JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH PROFITS ARE DETERMINED TO BE EARNED

AND TAXED;



THE REPATRIATION OF

NON-U.S.

EARNINGS

FOR WHICH WE HAVE NOT PREVIOUSLY PROVIDED FOR U.S. TAXES;



ADJUSTMENTS TO ESTIMATED TAXES UPON FINALIZATION OF VARIOUS TAX

RETURNS;



INCREASES IN EXPENSES NOT DEDUCTIBLE FOR TAX PURPOSES, INCLUDING

WRITE-OFFS OF ACQUIRED IN-PROCESS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT AND

IMPAIRMENT OF GOODWILL IN CONNECTION WITH ACQUISITIONS;



CHANGES IN AVAILABLE TAX CREDITS;



CHANGES IN SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE;



CHANGES IN THE VALUATION OF OUR DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND

LIABILITIES;



CHANGES IN TAX LAWS OR THE INTERPRETATION OF SUCH TAX

LAWS; AND



THE RESOLUTION OF ISSUES ARISING FROM TAX AUDITS WITH VARIOUS

TAX AUTHORITIES.

ANY SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN OUR FUTURE EFFECTIVE TAX RATES COULD

ADVERSELY IMPACT NET INCOME FOR FUTURE PERIODS.

IN ADDITION, THE U.S. INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE (IRS) AND

OTHER TAX AUTHORITIES REGULARLY EXAMINE OUR INCOME TAX RETURNS.

THE IRS HAS ISSUED FORMAL ASSESSMENTS RELATED TO AMOUNTS

REFLECTED ON CERTAIN OF OUR TAX RETURNS AS A TAX BENEFIT FOR OUR

EXPORT SALES (SEE NOTE 18: CONTINGENCIES IN

PART II, ITEM 8 OF THIS

FORM

10-K).

OUR

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COULD BE ADVERSELY IMPACTED IF THESE

ASSESSMENTS OR ANY OTHER ASSESSMENTS RESULTING FROM THE

EXAMINATION OF OUR INCOME TAX RETURNS BY THE IRS OR OTHER TAXING

AUTHORITIES ARE NOT RESOLVED IN OUR FAVOR.

WE INVEST IN COMPANIES FOR STRATEGIC REASONS AND MAY NOT

REALIZE A RETURN ON OUR INVESTMENTS.

WE MAKE INVESTMENTS IN COMPANIES AROUND THE WORLD TO FURTHER OUR

STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES AND SUPPORT OUR KEY BUSINESS INITIATIVES.

SUCH INVESTMENTS INCLUDE INVESTMENTS IN EQUITY SECURITIES OF

PUBLIC COMPANIES AND INVESTMENTS IN NON-MARKETABLE EQUITY

SECURITIES OF PRIVATE COMPANIES, WHICH RANGE FROM EARLY-STAGE

COMPANIES THAT ARE OFTEN STILL DEFINING THEIR STRATEGIC

DIRECTION TO MORE MATURE COMPANIES WHOSE PRODUCTS OR

TECHNOLOGIES MAY DIRECTLY SUPPORT AN INTEL PRODUCT OR

INITIATIVE. THE SUCCESS OF THESE COMPANIES (OR LACK THEREOF) IS

DEPENDENT ON PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT, MARKET ACCEPTANCE, OPERATIONAL

EFFICIENCY AND OTHER KEY BUSINESS SUCCESS FACTORS. THE PRIVATE

COMPANIES IN WHICH WE INVEST MAY FAIL BECAUSE THEY MAY NOT BE

ABLE TO SECURE ADDITIONAL FUNDING, OBTAIN FAVORABLE INVESTMENT

TERMS FOR FUTURE FINANCINGS OR TAKE ADVANTAGE OF LIQUIDITY

EVENTS, SUCH AS INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERINGS, MERGERS AND PRIVATE

SALES. IF ANY OF THESE PRIVATE COMPANIES FAIL, WE COULD LOSE ALL

OR PART OF OUR INVESTMENT IN THAT COMPANY. IN ADDITION, IF WE

DETERMINE THAT AN OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY DECLINE IN THE FAIR VALUE

EXISTS FOR THE EQUITY SECURITIES OF THE PUBLIC AND PRIVATE

COMPANIES IN WHICH WE INVEST, WE WRITE DOWN THE INVESTMENT TO

ITS FAIR VALUE AND RECORD THE RELATED WRITE-DOWN AS AN

INVESTMENT LOSS. FURTHERMORE, WHEN THE STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES OF

AN INVESTMENT HAVE BEEN ACHIEVED, OR IF THE INVESTMENT OR

BUSINESS DIVERGES FROM OUR STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES, WE MAY DECIDE

TO DISPOSE OF THE INVESTMENT. OUR INVESTMENTS IN NON-MARKETABLE

EQUITY SECURITIES OF PRIVATE COMPANIES ARE NOT LIQUID, AND WE

MAY NOT BE ABLE TO DISPOSE OF THESE INVESTMENTS ON FAVORABLE

TERMS OR AT ALL. THE OCCURRENCE OF ANY OF THESE EVENTS COULD

NEGATIVELY AFFECT OUR NET INCOME AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.
