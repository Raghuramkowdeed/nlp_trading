RISK FACTORS

THE FOLLOWING RISKS COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, AND THE TRADING PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK COULD DECLINE. THESE RISK FACTORS DO NOT IDENTIFY ALL RISKS THAT WE FACE; OUR OPERATIONS COULD ALSO BE AFFECTED BY FACTORS THAT ARE NOT PRESENTLY KNOWN TO US OR THAT WE CURRENTLY CONSIDER TO BE IMMATERIAL TO OUR OPERATIONS. DUE TO RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES, KNOWN AND UNKNOWN, OUR PAST FINANCIAL RESULTS MAY NOT BE A RELIABLE INDICATOR OF FUTURE PERFORMANCE, AND HISTORICAL TRENDS SHOULD NOT BE USED TO ANTICIPATE RESULTS OR TRENDS IN FUTURE PERIODS. REFER ALSO TO THE OTHER INFORMATION SET FORTH IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K, INCLUDING "MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS" AND OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND THE RELATED NOTES.

CHANGES IN PRODUCT DEMAND CAN ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS.

DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS IS VARIABLE AND HARD TO PREDICT.

CHANGES

IN THE DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS MAY REDUCE OUR REVENUE, INCREASE OUR COSTS, LOWER OUR GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE, OR REQUIRE US TO WRITE DOWN THE VALUE OF OUR ASSETS. OUR PLATFORM PRODUCTS ARE USED ACROSS DIFFERENT MARKET SEGMENTS, AND DEMAND FOR OUR PLATFORMS MAY VARY WITHIN OR AMONG OUR CLIENT COMPUTING, DATA CENTER, INTERNET OF THINGS, AND OTHER MARKET SEGMENTS. IT IS DIFFICULT TO ANTICIPATE THE IMPACT OF THESE CHANGES, AS DEMAND MAY INCREASE IN ONE OR MORE MARKET SEGMENTS WHILE DECREASING IN OTHERS. IMPORTANT FACTORS THAT COULD LEAD TO VARIATION IN THE DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS INCLUDE CHANGES IN.



BUSINESS CONDITIONS, INCLUDING DOWNTURNS IN THE COMPUTING INDUSTRY, OR IN THE GLOBAL OR REGIONAL ECONOMIES;



CONSUMER CONFIDENCE OR INCOME LEVELS CAUSED BY CHANGES IN MARKET CONDITIONS, INCLUDING CHANGES IN GOVERNMENT BORROWING, TAXATION, OR SPENDING POLICIES; THE CREDIT MARKET; OR EXPECTED INFLATION, EMPLOYMENT, AND ENERGY OR OTHER COMMODITY PRICES;



THE LEVEL OF OUR CUSTOMERS INVENTORIES;



COMPETITIVE AND PRICING PRESSURES, INCLUDING ACTIONS TAKEN BY COMPETITORS;



CUSTOMER PRODUCT NEEDS;



MARKET ACCEPTANCE AND INDUSTRY SUPPORT OF OUR NEW AND MATURING PRODUCTS; AND



THE TECHNOLOGY SUPPLY CHAIN, INCLUDING SUPPLY CONSTRAINTS CAUSED BY NATURAL DISASTERS OR OTHER EVENTS.

WE FACE SIGNIFICANT COMPETITION.

THE

INDUSTRY IN WHICH WE OPERATE IS HIGHLY COMPETITIVE AND SUBJECT TO RAPID TECHNOLOGICAL AND MARKET DEVELOPMENTS, CHANGES IN INDUSTRY STANDARDS, CHANGES IN CUSTOMER NEEDS, AND FREQUENT PRODUCT INTRODUCTIONS AND IMPROVEMENTS. IF WE DO NOT ANTICIPATE AND RESPOND TO THESE DEVELOPMENTS, OUR COMPETITIVE POSITION MAY WEAKEN, AND OUR PRODUCTS OR TECHNOLOGIES MIGHT BE UNCOMPETITIVE OR OBSOLETE. ADDITIONALLY, A NUMBER OF BUSINESS COMBINATIONS, INCLUDING MERGERS, ASSET ACQUISITIONS AND STRATEGIC PARTNERSHIPS, IN THE SEMICONDUCTOR INDUSTRY HAVE OCCURRED OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS, AND MORE COULD OCCUR IN THE FUTURE. CONSOLIDATION IN THE INDUSTRY COULD LEAD TO FEWER CUSTOMERS, PARTNERS OR SUPPLIERS, ANY OF WHICH COULD NEGATIVELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS.

IN RECENT YEARS, OUR BUSINESS FOCUS HAS EXPANDED AND NOW INCLUDES THE DESIGN AND PRODUCTION OF PLATFORMS AND OTHER PRODUCTS FOR THE DATA CENTER, INTERNET OF THINGS, AND MEMORY MARKET SEGMENTS, INCLUDING FPGA PRODUCTS, CONNECTIVITY PRODUCTS, AND A NUMBER OF OTHER PRODUCTS AND SERVICES FOR A WIDE RANGE OF CONNECTED DEVICES. AS A RESULT, WE FACE NEW SOURCES OF COMPETITION, INCLUDING, IN CERTAIN OF THESE MARKET SEGMENTS, FROM INCUMBENT COMPETITORS WITH ESTABLISHED CUSTOMER BASES AND GREATER BRAND RECOGNITION. TO BE SUCCESSFUL, WE NEED TO CULTIVATE NEW INDUSTRY RELATIONSHIPS WITH CUSTOMERS AND PARTNERS IN THESE MARKET SEGMENTS. IN ADDITION, WE MUST CONTINUALLY IMPROVE THE COST, INTEGRATION, AND ENERGY EFFICIENCY OF OUR PRODUCTS, AS WELL AS EXPAND OUR SOFTWARE CAPABILITIES TO PROVIDE CUSTOMERS WITH COMPREHENSIVE COMPUTING SOLUTIONS. DESPITE OUR ONGOING EFFORTS, THERE IS NO GUARANTEE THAT WE WILL ACHIEVE OR MAINTAIN CONSUMER AND MARKET DEMAND OR ACCEPTANCE FOR OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES IN THESE VARIOUS MARKET SEGMENTS.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

TO COMPETE SUCCESSFULLY, WE MUST MAINTAIN A SUCCESSFUL R&D EFFORT, DEVELOP NEW PRODUCTS AND PRODUCTION PROCESSES, AND IMPROVE OUR EXISTING PRODUCTS AND PROCESSES AHEAD OF COMPETITORS. FOR EXAMPLE, WE INVEST SUBSTANTIALLY IN OUR NETWORK OF MANUFACTURING AND ASSEMBLY AND TEST FACILITIES, INCLUDING THE CONSTRUCTION OF NEW FABRICATION FACILITIES TO SUPPORT SMALLER TRANSISTOR GEOMETRIES AND LARGER WAFERS. OUR R&D EFFORTS ARE CRITICAL TO OUR SUCCESS AND ARE AIMED AT SOLVING COMPLEX PROBLEMS, AND WE DO NOT EXPECT ALL OF OUR PROJECTS TO BE SUCCESSFUL. WE MAY BE UNABLE TO DEVELOP AND MARKET NEW PRODUCTS SUCCESSFULLY, AND THE PRODUCTS WE INVEST IN AND DEVELOP MAY NOT BE WELL-RECEIVED BY CUSTOMERS. OUR R&D INVESTMENTS MAY NOT GENERATE SIGNIFICANT OPERATING INCOME OR CONTRIBUTE TO OUR FUTURE OPERATING RESULTS FOR SEVERAL YEARS, AND SUCH CONTRIBUTIONS MAY NOT MEET OUR EXPECTATIONS OR EVEN COVER THE COSTS OF SUCH INVESTMENTS. ADDITIONALLY, THE PRODUCTS AND TECHNOLOGIES OFFERED BY OTHERS MAY AFFECT DEMAND FOR, OR PRICING OF, OUR PRODUCTS.

IF WE ARE NOT ABLE TO COMPETE EFFECTIVELY, OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS WILL BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED, INCLUDING INCREASED COSTS AND REDUCED REVENUE AND GROSS MARGIN, AND WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO ACCELERATE THE WRITE-DOWN OF THE VALUE OF CERTAIN ASSETS.

CHANGES IN THE MIX OF PRODUCTS SOLD MAY HARM OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS.

OUR PRICING AND MARGINS VARY ACROSS OUR PRODUCTS AND MARKET SEGMENTS DUE TO DIFFERENCES IN PRODUCT FEATURES OR MANUFACTURING COSTS. FOR EXAMPLE, OUR PLATFORM PRODUCT OFFERINGS RANGE FROM LOWER-PRICED AND ENTRY-LEVEL PLATFORMS, SUCH AS THOSE BASED ON INTEL QUARK OR INTEL ATOM PROCESSORS, TO HIGHER-END PLATFORMS BASED ON INTEL XEON PROCESSORS. IF DEMAND SHIFTS FROM OUR HIGHER-PRICED TO LOWER-PRICED PLATFORMS IN ANY OF OUR MARKET SEGMENTS, OUR GROSS MARGIN AND REVENUE WOULD DECREASE. IN ADDITION, WHEN PRODUCTS ARE INTRODUCED, THEY TEND TO HAVE HIGHER COSTS BECAUSE OF INITIAL DEVELOPMENT COSTS AND LOWER PRODUCTION VOLUMES RELATIVE TO THE PREVIOUS PRODUCT GENERATION, WHICH CAN IMPACT GROSS MARGIN.

WE OPERATE GLOBALLY AND ARE SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT RISKS IN MANY JURISDICTIONS.

GLOBAL OR REGIONAL CONDITIONS MAY HARM OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS.

WE HAVE MANUFACTURING, ASSEMBLY AND TEST, R&D, SALES, AND OTHER OPERATIONS IN MANY COUNTRIES, AND SOME OF OUR BUSINESS ACTIVITIES MAY BE CONCENTRATED IN ONE OR MORE GEOGRAPHIC AREAS. MOREOVER, SALES OUTSIDE THE U.S. ACCOUNTED FOR APPROXIMATELY

78%

OF OUR REVENUE FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED

DECEMBER 31, 2016

. AS A RESULT, OUR OPERATIONS AND OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS, INCLUDING OUR ABILITY TO MANUFACTURE, ASSEMBLE AND TEST, DESIGN, DEVELOP, OR SELL PRODUCTS, MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY A NUMBER OF FACTORS OUTSIDE OF OUR CONTROL, INCLUDING.



GLOBAL AND LOCAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS;



GEOPOLITICAL AND SECURITY ISSUES, SUCH AS ARMED CONFLICT AND CIVIL OR MILITARY UNREST, CRIME, POLITICAL INSTABILITY, HUMAN RIGHTS CONCERNS, AND TERRORIST ACTIVITY;



NATURAL DISASTERS, PUBLIC HEALTH ISSUES, AND OTHER CATASTROPHIC EVENTS;



INEFFICIENT INFRASTRUCTURE AND OTHER DISRUPTIONS, SUCH AS SUPPLY CHAIN INTERRUPTIONS AND LARGE-SCALE OUTAGES OR UNRELIABLE PROVISION OF SERVICES FROM UTILITIES, TRANSPORTATION, DATA HOSTING, OR TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROVIDERS;



GOVERNMENT RESTRICTIONS ON, OR NATIONALIZATION OF OUR OPERATIONS IN ANY COUNTRY, OR RESTRICTIONS ON OUR ABILITY TO REPATRIATE EARNINGS FROM A PARTICULAR COUNTRY;



DIFFERING EMPLOYMENT PRACTICES AND LABOR ISSUES;



FORMAL OR INFORMAL IMPOSITION OF NEW OR REVISED EXPORT AND/OR IMPORT AND DOING-BUSINESS REGULATIONS, INCLUDING TRADE SANCTIONS AND TARIFFS, WHICH COULD BE CHANGED WITHOUT NOTICE;



INEFFECTIVE LEGAL PROTECTION OF OUR IP RIGHTS IN CERTAIN COUNTRIES;



LOCAL BUSINESS AND CULTURAL FACTORS THAT DIFFER FROM OUR NORMAL STANDARDS AND PRACTICES; AND



INCREASED UNCERTAINTY REGARDING SOCIAL, POLITICAL, IMMIGRATION AND TRADE POLICIES IN THE U.S. AND ABROAD, SUCH AS RECENT U.S. LEGISLATION AND POLICIES AND THE UNITED KINGDOM'S REFERENDUM TO WITHDRAW FROM THE EUROPEAN UNION ("BREXIT").

WE ARE SUBJECT TO LAWS AND REGULATIONS WORLDWIDE, WHICH MAY DIFFER AMONG JURISDICTIONS, AFFECTING OUR OPERATIONS IN AREAS INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO: IP OWNERSHIP AND INFRINGEMENT; TAX; IMPORT AND EXPORT REQUIREMENTS; ANTI-CORRUPTION; FOREIGN EXCHANGE CONTROLS AND CASH REPATRIATION RESTRICTIONS; DATA PRIVACY REQUIREMENTS; ANTI-COMPETITION; ADVERTISING; EMPLOYMENT; PRODUCT REGULATIONS; ENVIRONMENT, HEALTH, AND SAFETY REQUIREMENTS; AND CONSUMER LAWS. COMPLIANCE WITH SUCH REQUIREMENTS MAY BE ONEROUS AND EXPENSIVE, AND MAY OTHERWISE IMPACT OUR BUSINESS OPERATIONS NEGATIVELY. ALTHOUGH WE HAVE POLICIES, CONTROLS, AND PROCEDURES DESIGNED TO HELP ENSURE COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE LAWS, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT OUR EMPLOYEES, CONTRACTORS, SUPPLIERS, AND/OR AGENTS WILL NOT VIOLATE SUCH LAWS OR OUR POLICIES. VIOLATIONS OF THESE LAWS AND REGULATIONS COULD RESULT IN FINES; CRIMINAL SANCTIONS AGAINST US, OUR OFFICERS, OR OUR EMPLOYEES; PROHIBITIONS ON THE CONDUCT OF OUR BUSINESS; AND DAMAGE TO OUR REPUTATION.

WE MAY BE AFFECTED BY FLUCTUATIONS IN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES.

WE ARE POTENTIALLY EXPOSED TO ADVERSE AS WELL AS BENEFICIAL MOVEMENTS IN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES. ALTHOUGH MOST OF OUR SALES OCCUR IN U.S. DOLLARS, EXPENSES MAY BE PAID IN LOCAL CURRENCIES. AN INCREASE IN THE VALUE OF THE DOLLAR COULD INCREASE THE REAL COST TO OUR CUSTOMERS OF OUR PRODUCTS IN THOSE MARKETS OUTSIDE THE U.S. WHERE WE SELL IN DOLLARS, AND A WEAKENED DOLLAR COULD INCREASE THE COST OF EXPENSES SUCH AS PAYROLL, UTILITIES, TAX, AND MARKETING EXPENSES, AS WELL AS OVERSEAS CAPITAL EXPENDITURES. WE ALSO CONDUCT CERTAIN INVESTING AND FINANCING ACTIVITIES IN LOCAL CURRENCIES. OUR HEDGING PROGRAMS REDUCE, BUT DO NOT ELIMINATE, THE IMPACT OF CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE MOVEMENTS; THEREFORE, CHANGES IN EXCHANGE RATES COULD HARM OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

CATASTROPHIC EVENTS OR GEOPOLITICAL CONDITIONS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL RESULTS.

OUR OPERATIONS OR SYSTEMS COULD BE DISRUPTED BY NATURAL DISASTERS; INDUSTRIAL ACCIDENTS; GEOPOLITICAL CONDITIONS; TERRORIST ACTIVITY; PUBLIC HEALTH ISSUES; CYBERSECURITY INCIDENTS; INTERRUPTIONS OF SERVICE FROM UTILITIES, TRANSPORTATION, OR TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROVIDERS; OR OTHER CATASTROPHIC EVENTS. SUCH EVENTS COULD MAKE IT DIFFICULT OR IMPOSSIBLE TO MANUFACTURE OR DELIVER PRODUCTS TO OUR CUSTOMERS, RECEIVE PRODUCTION MATERIALS FROM OUR SUPPLIERS, OR PERFORM CRITICAL FUNCTIONS, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR REVENUE AND REQUIRE SIGNIFICANT RECOVERY TIME AND EXPENDITURES TO RESUME OPERATIONS. WHILE WE MAINTAIN BUSINESS RECOVERY PLANS THAT ARE INTENDED TO ENABLE US TO RECOVER FROM NATURAL DISASTERS OR OTHER EVENTS THAT CAN BE DISRUPTIVE TO OUR BUSINESS, SOME OF OUR SYSTEMS ARE NOT FULLY REDUNDANT AND WE CANNOT BE SURE THAT OUR PLANS WILL FULLY PROTECT US FROM ALL SUCH DISRUPTIONS.

WE MAINTAIN A PROGRAM OF INSURANCE COVERAGE FOR A VARIETY OF PROPERTY, CASUALTY, AND OTHER RISKS. THE TYPES AND AMOUNTS OF INSURANCE WE OBTAIN VARY DEPENDING ON AVAILABILITY, COST, AND DECISIONS WITH RESPECT TO RISK RETENTION. SOME OF OUR POLICIES HAVE LARGE DEDUCTIBLES AND BROAD EXCLUSIONS. IN ADDITION, ONE OR MORE OF OUR INSURANCE PROVIDERS MAY BE UNABLE OR UNWILLING TO PAY A CLAIM. LOSSES NOT COVERED BY INSURANCE MAY BE LARGE, WHICH COULD HARM OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

WE ARE VULNERABLE TO PRODUCT AND MANUFACTURING-RELATED RISKS.

DUE TO THE VARIABILITY IN DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS AND THE COMPLEXITY OF OUR MANUFACTURING OPERATIONS, WE MAY BE UNABLE TO TIMELY RESPOND TO FLUCTUATIONS IN DEMAND.

OUR OPERATIONS HAVE HIGH COSTS THAT ARE EITHER FIXED OR DIFFICULT TO REDUCE IN THE SHORT TERM, INCLUDING OUR COSTS RELATED TO MANUFACTURING, SUCH AS FACILITY CONSTRUCTION AND EQUIPMENT, R&D, AND THE EMPLOYMENT AND TRAINING OF A HIGHLY SKILLED WORKFORCE. IF PRODUCT DEMAND DECREASES OR WE FAIL TO FORECAST DEMAND ACCURATELY, WE COULD BE REQUIRED TO WRITE OFF INVENTORY OR RECORD EXCESS CAPACITY CHARGES, WHICH WOULD LOWER OUR GROSS MARGIN. OUR MANUFACTURING OR ASSEMBLY AND TEST CAPACITY COULD BE UNDERUTILIZED, AND WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO WRITE DOWN OUR LONG-LIVED ASSETS, WHICH WOULD INCREASE OUR EXPENSES. FACTORY-PLANNING DECISIONS MAY SHORTEN THE USEFUL LIVES OF FACILITIES AND EQUIPMENT AND CAUSE US TO ACCELERATE DEPRECIATION.

CONVERSELY, IF PRODUCT DEMAND INCREASES, WE MAY BE UNABLE TO ADD CAPACITY FAST ENOUGH TO MEET MARKET DEMAND. OUR REVENUE AND GROSS MARGIN CAN ALSO BE AFFECTED BY THE TIMING OF OUR PRODUCT INTRODUCTIONS AND RELATED EXPENSES, INCLUDING MARKETING EXPENSES.

WE ARE SUBJECT TO RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE DEVELOPMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION OF NEW MANUFACTURING PROCESS TECHNOLOGY.

WE MAY NOT BE SUCCESSFUL OR EFFICIENT IN DEVELOPING OR IMPLEMENTING NEW PRODUCTION PROCESSES. PRODUCTION OF INTEGRATED CIRCUITS IS A COMPLEX PROCESS. WE ARE CONTINUALLY ENGAGED IN THE TRANSITION FROM OUR EXISTING PROCESS TO THE NEXT-GENERATION PROCESS TECHNOLOGY. THIS CONSISTENT INNOVATION INVOLVES SIGNIFICANT EXPENSE AND CARRIES INHERENT RISKS, INCLUDING DIFFICULTIES IN DESIGNING AND DEVELOPING NEXT-GENERATION PROCESS TECHNOLOGIES, DEVELOPMENT AND PRODUCTION TIMING DELAYS, LOWER THAN ANTICIPATED MANUFACTURING YIELDS, AND PRODUCT DEFECTS AND ERRATA. DISRUPTIONS IN THE PRODUCTION PROCESS CAN ALSO RESULT FROM ERRORS, DEFECTS IN MATERIALS, DELAYS IN OBTAINING OR REVISING OPERATING PERMITS AND LICENSES, INTERRUPTION IN OUR SUPPLY OF MATERIALS OR RESOURCES, AND DISRUPTIONS AT OUR FABRICATION AND ASSEMBLY AND TEST FACILITIES DUE TO ACCIDENTS, MAINTENANCE ISSUES, OR UNSAFE WORKING CONDITIONSALL OF WHICH COULD AFFECT THE TIMING OF PRODUCTION RAMPS AND YIELDS. PRODUCTION ISSUES CAN LEAD TO INCREASED COSTS AND MAY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO MEET PRODUCT DEMAND, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR BUSINESS AND THE RESULTS FROM OPERATIONS.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

WE FACE SUPPLY CHAIN RISKS.

THOUSANDS OF SUPPLIERS PROVIDE MATERIALS AND EQUIPMENT THAT WE USE IN PRODUCTION AND OTHER ASPECTS OF OUR BUSINESS. WHERE POSSIBLE, WE SEEK TO HAVE SEVERAL SOURCES OF SUPPLY FOR ALL OF THOSE MATERIALS. HOWEVER, FOR CERTAIN MATERIALS, WE MAY RELY ON A SINGLE OR A LIMITED NUMBER OF SUPPLIERS, OR UPON SUPPLIERS IN A SINGLE LOCATION. IN ADDITION, CONSOLIDATION AMONG SUPPLIERS COULD IMPACT THE NATURE, QUALITY, AVAILABILITY, AND PRICING OF THE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES AVAILABLE TO US. THE INABILITY OF SUPPLIERS TO DELIVER ADEQUATE SUPPLIES OF PRODUCTION MATERIALS OR OTHER SUPPLIES COULD DISRUPT OUR PRODUCTION PROCESSES OR MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR US TO IMPLEMENT OUR BUSINESS STRATEGY. PRODUCTION COULD BE DISRUPTED BY THE UNAVAILABILITY OF RESOURCES USED IN PRODUCTION, SUCH AS WATER, SILICON, ELECTRICITY, GASES, AND OTHER MATERIALS. THE UNAVAILABILITY OR REDUCED AVAILABILITY OF MATERIALS OR RESOURCES MAY REQUIRE US TO REDUCE PRODUCTION OR INCUR ADDITIONAL COSTS, WHICH COULD HARM OUR BUSINESS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. OUR MANUFACTURING OPERATIONS AND ABILITY TO MEET PRODUCT DEMAND MAY ALSO BE IMPACTED BY IP OR OTHER LITIGATION BETWEEN OUR SUPPLIERS, WHERE AN INJUNCTION AGAINST INTEL OR A SUPPLIER COULD INTERRUPT THE AVAILABILITY OF GOODS OR SERVICES SUPPLIED TO INTEL BY OTHERS.

WE ALSO RELY ON THIRD-PARTY PROVIDERS TO MANUFACTURE AND ASSEMBLE AND TEST CERTAIN COMPONENTS OR PRODUCTS, PARTICULARLY THOSE RELATED TO NETWORKING, MOBILE AND COMMUNICATIONS, PROGRAMMABLE SEMICONDUCTOR SOLUTIONS, AND NAND FLASH MEMORY. IF ANY OF THESE THIRD PARTIES ARE UNABLE TO PERFORM THESE SERVICES ON A TIMELY OR COST-EFFECTIVE BASIS, WE MAY ENCOUNTER SUPPLY DELAYS OR DISRUPTIONS THAT COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS.

IN ADDITION, THERE ARE REGULATORY AND OTHER REQUIREMENTS, RESTRICTIONS, AND REQUESTS FROM VARIOUS CONSTITUENCIES REGARDING SOURCING PRACTICES AND SUPPLIER CONDUCT, WITH A TREND TOWARD EXPANDING THE SCOPE OF MATERIALS AND LOCATIONS WHERE MATERIALS ORIGINATE, REGULATING SUPPLIER BEHAVIORS, AND INCREASING THE REQUIRED DISCLOSURES REGARDING SUCH MATTERS BY PUBLIC COMPANIES. INCREASED REGULATION AND PUBLIC PRESSURE IN THIS AREA WOULD CAUSE OUR COMPLIANCE COSTS TO INCREASE AND COULD NEGATIVELY AFFECT OUR REPUTATION GIVEN THAT WE USE MANY MATERIALS IN THE MANUFACTURING OF OUR PRODUCTS AND RELY ON MANY SUPPLIERS TO PROVIDE THESE MATERIALS, BUT DO NOT DIRECTLY CONTROL THEIR PROCUREMENT OR EMPLOYMENT PRACTICES.

WE ARE SUBJECT TO THE RISKS OF PRODUCT DEFECTS, ERRATA OR OTHER PRODUCT ISSUES.

PRODUCT DEFECTS AND ERRATA (DEVIATIONS FROM PUBLISHED SPECIFICATIONS) MAY RESULT FROM PROBLEMS IN OUR PRODUCT DESIGN OR OUR MANUFACTURING AND ASSEMBLY AND TEST PROCESSES. COMPONENTS AND PRODUCTS WE PURCHASE OR LICENSE FROM THIRD-PARTY SUPPLIERS, OR ATTAIN THROUGH ACQUISITIONS, MAY ALSO CONTAIN DEFECTS. WE COULD FACE RISKS IF PRODUCTS THAT WE DESIGN, MANUFACTURE OR SELL, OR THAT INCLUDE OUR TECHNOLOGY, CAUSE PERSONAL INJURY OR PROPERTY DAMAGE, EVEN WHERE THE CAUSE IS UNRELATED TO PRODUCT DEFECTS OR ERRATA. THESE RISKS MAY INCREASE AS OUR PRODUCTS ARE INTRODUCED INTO NEW DEVICES, MARKETS, TECHNOLOGIES, OR APPLICATIONS THROUGH THE INTERNET OF THINGS, INCLUDING WEARABLES, DRONES AND TRANSPORTATION, AND INDUSTRIAL AND CONSUMER USES. COSTS FROM DEFECTS, ERRATA, OR OTHER PRODUCT ISSUES COULD INCLUDE.



WRITING OFF SOME OR ALL OF THE VALUE OF INVENTORY;



RECALLING PRODUCTS THAT HAVE BEEN SHIPPED;



PROVIDING PRODUCT REPLACEMENTS OR MODIFICATIONS;



REIMBURSING CUSTOMERS FOR CERTAIN COSTS THEY INCUR;



DEFENDING AGAINST LITIGATION AND/OR PAYING RESULTING DAMAGES; AND



PAYING FINES IMPOSED BY REGULATORY AGENCIES.

THESE COSTS COULD BE LARGE AND MAY INCREASE EXPENSES AND LOWER GROSS MARGIN, AND RESULT IN DELAY OR LOSS OF REVENUE. ANY PRODUCT DEFECTS, ERRATA, OR OTHER ISSUES COULD ALSO DAMAGE OUR REPUTATION, NEGATIVELY AFFECT PRODUCT DEMAND, DELAY PRODUCT RELEASES, OR RESULT IN LEGAL LIABILITY. THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF PRODUCT DEFECTS OR ERRATA COULD CAUSE CUSTOMERS TO PURCHASE PRODUCTS FROM COMPETITORS AS A RESULT OF POSSIBLE SHORTAGES OF OUR COMPONENTS OR FOR OTHER REASONS. ANY OF THESE OCCURRENCES COULD HARM OUR BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL RESULTS. IN ADDITION, ALTHOUGH WE MAINTAIN LIABILITY INSURANCE, OUR COVERAGE HAS CERTAIN EXCLUSIONS AND/OR MAY NOT ADEQUATELY COVER LIABILITIES INCURRED. OUR INSURANCE PROVIDERS MAY BE UNABLE OR UNWILLING TO PAY A CLAIM, AND LOSSES NOT COVERED BY INSURANCE COULD BE LARGE, WHICH COULD HARM OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION.

WE ARE SUBJECT TO RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS.

THE MANUFACTURING AND ASSEMBLY AND TEST OF OUR PRODUCTS REQUIRE THE USE OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS THAT ARE SUBJECT TO A BROAD ARRAY OF ENVIRONMENTAL, HEALTH, AND SAFETY LAWS AND REGULATIONS. OUR FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH THESE LAWS OR REGULATIONS COULD RESULT IN.



REGULATORY PENALTIES, FINES, AND LEGAL LIABILITIES;



SUSPENSION OF PRODUCTION;



ALTERATION OF OUR MANUFACTURING AND ASSEMBLY AND TEST PROCESSES;



REPUTATIONAL CHALLENGES; AND



RESTRICTIONS ON OUR OPERATIONS OR SALES.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

OUR FAILURE TO MANAGE THE USE, TRANSPORTATION, EMISSIONS, DISCHARGE, STORAGE, RECYCLING, OR DISPOSAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS COULD LEAD TO INCREASED COSTS OR FUTURE LIABILITIES. OUR ABILITY TO EXPAND OR MODIFY OUR MANUFACTURING CAPABILITY IN THE FUTURE MAY BE IMPEDED BY ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS, SUCH AS AIR QUALITY AND WASTEWATER REQUIREMENTS. ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS COULD ALSO REQUIRE US TO ACQUIRE POLLUTION ABATEMENT OR REMEDIATION EQUIPMENT, MODIFY PRODUCT DESIGNS, OR INCUR OTHER EXPENSES. MANY NEW MATERIALS THAT WE ARE EVALUATING FOR USE IN OUR OPERATIONS MAY BE SUBJECT TO REGULATION UNDER ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS. THESE RESTRICTIONS COULD HARM OUR BUSINESS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS BY INCREASING OUR EXPENSES OR REQUIRING US TO ALTER MANUFACTURING AND ASSEMBLY AND TEST PROCESSES.

CLIMATE CHANGE MAY ALSO POSE REGULATORY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RISKS THAT COULD HARM OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND AFFECT THE WAY WE CONDUCT BUSINESS. FOR EXAMPLE, CLIMATE CHANGE REGULATION COULD RESULT IN INCREASED MANUFACTURING COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH AIR POLLUTION CONTROL REQUIREMENTS, AND INCREASED OR NEW MONITORING, RECORDKEEPING, AND REPORTING OF GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS. WE ALSO SEE THE POTENTIAL FOR HIGHER ENERGY COSTS DRIVEN BY CLIMATE CHANGE REGULATIONS IF, FOR EXAMPLE, UTILITY COMPANIES PASS ON THEIR COSTS TO THEIR CUSTOMERS. FURTHERMORE, MANY OF OUR OPERATIONS ARE LOCATED IN SEMI-ARID REGIONS THAT MAY BECOME INCREASINGLY VULNERABLE TO PROLONGED DROUGHTS DUE TO CLIMATE CHANGE. OUR FABRICATION FACILITIES REQUIRE SIGNIFICANT WATER USE AND, WHILE WE RECYCLE AND REUSE A PORTION OF THE WATER USED, WE MAY HAVE DIFFICULTIES OBTAINING SUFFICIENT WATER TO FULFILL OUR OPERATIONAL NEEDS DUE THE LACK OF AVAILABLE INFRASTRUCTURE.

WE ARE SUBJECT TO IP RISKS AND RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH LITIGATION AND REGULATORY PROCEEDINGS.

WE MAY BE UNABLE TO ENFORCE OR PROTECT OUR IP RIGHTS.

WE REGARD OUR PATENTS, COPYRIGHTS, TRADE SECRETS, AND OTHER IP RIGHTS AS IMPORTANT TO THE SUCCESS OF OUR BUSINESS. WE RELY ON IP LAW AS WELL AS CONFIDENTIALITY AND LICENSING AGREEMENTS WITH OUR CUSTOMERS, EMPLOYEES, TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT PARTNERS, AND OTHERS TO PROTECT OUR IP RIGHTS. OUR ABILITY TO ENFORCE THESE RIGHTS IS SUBJECT TO GENERAL LITIGATION RISKS, AS WELL AS UNCERTAINTY AS TO THE ENFORCEABILITY OF OUR IP RIGHTS IN VARIOUS COUNTRIES. WHEN WE SEEK TO ENFORCE OUR RIGHTS, WE MAY BE SUBJECT TO CLAIMS THAT THE IP RIGHTS ARE INVALID, NOT ENFORCEABLE, OR LICENSED TO THE OPPOSING PARTY. OUR ASSERTION OF IP RIGHTS MAY RESULT IN THE OTHER PARTY SEEKING TO ASSERT CLAIMS AGAINST US, WHICH COULD HARM OUR BUSINESS. GOVERNMENTS MAY ADOPT REGULATIONSAND GOVERNMENTS OR COURTS MAY RENDER DECISIONSREQUIRING COMPULSORY LICENSING OF IP RIGHTS, OR GOVERNMENTS MAY REQUIRE PRODUCTS TO MEET STANDARDS THAT SERVE TO FAVOR LOCAL COMPANIES. OUR INABILITY TO ENFORCE OUR IP RIGHTS UNDER ANY OF THESE CIRCUMSTANCES MAY HARM OUR COMPETITIVE POSITION AND BUSINESS. IN ADDITION, THE THEFT OR UNAUTHORIZED USE OR PUBLICATION OF OUR TRADE SECRETS AND OTHER CONFIDENTIAL BUSINESS INFORMATION COULD HARM OUR COMPETITIVE POSITION AND REDUCE ACCEPTANCE OF OUR PRODUCTS; AS A RESULT, THE VALUE OF OUR INVESTMENT IN R&D, PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT, AND MARKETING COULD BE REDUCED.

OUR LICENSES WITH OTHER COMPANIES AND PARTICIPATION IN INDUSTRY INITIATIVES MAY ALLOW COMPETITORS TO USE OUR PATENT RIGHTS.

COMPANIES IN OUR INDUSTRY OFTEN BILATERALLY LICENSE PATENTS BETWEEN EACH OTHER TO SETTLE DISPUTES OR AS PART OF BUSINESS AGREEMENTS. OUR COMPETITORS MAY HAVE LICENSES TO OUR PATENTS, AND UNDER CURRENT CASE LAW, SOME OF THE LICENSES MAY EXHAUST OUR PATENT RIGHTS AS TO LICENSED PRODUCT SALES UNDER SOME CIRCUMSTANCES. OUR PARTICIPATION IN INDUSTRY STANDARDS ORGANIZATIONS OR WITH OTHER INDUSTRY INITIATIVES MAY REQUIRE US TO LICENSE OUR PATENTS TO COMPANIES THAT ADOPT INDUSTRY-STANDARD SPECIFICATIONS. DEPENDING ON THE RULES OF THE ORGANIZATION, WE MIGHT HAVE TO GRANT THESE LICENSES TO OUR PATENTS FOR LITTLE OR NO COST, AND AS A RESULT, WE MAY BE UNABLE TO ENFORCE CERTAIN PATENTS AGAINST OTHERS, OUR COSTS OF ENFORCING OUR LICENSES OR PROTECTING OUR PATENTS MAY INCREASE, AND THE VALUE OF OUR IP RIGHTS MAY BE IMPAIRED.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THIRD PARTIES MAY ASSERT CLAIMS BASED ON IP RIGHTS AGAINST US OR OUR PRODUCTS, WHICH COULD HARM OUR BUSINESS.

WE MAY FACE CLAIMS BASED ON IP RIGHTS FROM INDIVIDUALS AND COMPANIES, INCLUDING THOSE WHO HAVE ACQUIRED PATENT PORTFOLIOS TO ASSERT CLAIMS AGAINST OTHER COMPANIES. WE ARE NORMALLY ENGAGED IN A NUMBER OF LITIGATION MATTERS INVOLVING IP RIGHTS. CLAIMS THAT OUR PRODUCTS OR PROCESSES INFRINGE THE IP RIGHTS OF OTHERS, WHETHER OR NOT MERITORIOUS, COULD CAUSE US TO INCUR LARGE COSTS TO RESPOND TO, DEFEND, AND RESOLVE, AND THEY MAY DIVERT THE EFFORTS AND ATTENTION OF MANAGEMENT AND TECHNICAL PERSONNEL. IN ADDITION, WE MAY FACE CLAIMS BASED ON THE THEFT OR UNAUTHORIZED USE OR DISCLOSURE OF THIRD-PARTY TRADE SECRETS AND OTHER CONFIDENTIAL BUSINESS INFORMATION OR END-USER DATA THAT WE OBTAIN IN CONDUCTING OUR BUSINESS. ANY SUCH INCIDENTS AND CLAIMS COULD SEVERELY DISRUPT OUR BUSINESS, AND WE COULD SUFFER LOSSES, INCLUDING THE COST OF PRODUCT RECALLS AND RETURNS, AND REPUTATIONAL HARM. FURTHERMORE, WE HAVE AGREED TO INDEMNIFY CUSTOMERS FOR CERTAIN IP RIGHTS CLAIMS AGAINST THEM. AS A RESULT OF IP RIGHTS CLAIMS, WE COULD.



PAY MONETARY DAMAGES, INCLUDING PAYMENTS TO SATISFY INDEMNIFICATION OBLIGATIONS;



STOP MANUFACTURING, USING, SELLING, OFFERING TO SELL, OR IMPORTING PRODUCTS OR TECHNOLOGY SUBJECT TO CLAIMS;



DEVELOP OTHER PRODUCTS OR TECHNOLOGY NOT SUBJECT TO CLAIMS, WHICH COULD BE TIME-CONSUMING OR COSTLY; AND/OR



ENTER INTO SETTLEMENT AND LICENSE AGREEMENTS, WHICH AGREEMENTS MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE ON COMMERCIALLY REASONABLE TERMS.

THESE IP RIGHTS CLAIMS COULD HARM OUR COMPETITIVE POSITION, RESULT IN EXPENSES, OR REQUIRE US TO IMPAIR OUR ASSETS. IF WE ALTER OR STOP PRODUCTION OF AFFECTED ITEMS, OUR REVENUE COULD BE HARMED.

WE RELY ON ACCESS TO THIRD-PARTY IP, WHICH MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE TO US ON COMMERCIALLY REASONABLE TERMS OR AT ALL.

MANY OF OUR PRODUCTS INCLUDE THIRD-PARTY IP AND/OR IMPLEMENT INDUSTRY STANDARDS, WHICH MAY REQUIRE LICENSES FROM THIRD PARTIES. BASED ON PAST EXPERIENCE AND INDUSTRY PRACTICE, WE BELIEVE SUCH LICENSES GENERALLY CAN BE OBTAINED ON COMMERCIALLY REASONABLE TERMS. HOWEVER, THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT THE NECESSARY LICENSES CAN BE OBTAINED ON ACCEPTABLE TERMS OR AT ALL. FAILURE TO OBTAIN THE RIGHT TO USE THIRD-PARTY IP, OR TO USE SUCH IP ON COMMERCIALLY REASONABLE TERMS, COULD PRECLUDE US FROM SELLING CERTAIN PRODUCTS OR OTHERWISE HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS.

WE ARE SUBJECT TO THE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH LITIGATION AND REGULATORY PROCEEDINGS.

WE MAY FACE LEGAL CLAIMS OR REGULATORY MATTERS INVOLVING STOCKHOLDER, CONSUMER, COMPETITION, AND OTHER ISSUES ON A GLOBAL BASIS. AS DESCRIBED IN "

NOTE 20: COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

" IN PART II, ITEM 8 OF THIS FORM 10-K, WE ARE ENGAGED IN A NUMBER OF LITIGATION AND REGULATORY MATTERS. LITIGATION AND REGULATORY PROCEEDINGS ARE INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN, AND ADVERSE RULINGS COULD OCCUR, INCLUDING MONETARY DAMAGES, OR AN INJUNCTION STOPPING US FROM MANUFACTURING OR SELLING CERTAIN PRODUCTS, ENGAGING IN CERTAIN BUSINESS PRACTICES, OR REQUIRING OTHER REMEDIES, SUCH AS COMPULSORY LICENSING OF PATENTS. AN UNFAVORABLE OUTCOME MAY RESULT IN A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR BUSINESS, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL POSITION, AND OVERALL TRENDS. IN ADDITION, REGARDLESS OF THE OUTCOME, LITIGATION CAN BE COSTLY, TIME-CONSUMING, DISRUPTIVE TO OUR OPERATIONS, AND DISTRACTING TO MANAGEMENT.

WE MUST ATTRACT, RETAIN, AND MOTIVATE KEY EMPLOYEES.

TO BE COMPETITIVE, WE MUST ATTRACT, RETAIN, AND MOTIVATE EXECUTIVES AND OTHER KEY EMPLOYEES. HIRING AND RETAINING QUALIFIED EXECUTIVES, SCIENTISTS, ENGINEERS, TECHNICAL STAFF, AND SALES REPRESENTATIVES ARE CRITICAL TO OUR BUSINESS, AND COMPETITION FOR EXPERIENCED EMPLOYEES CAN BE INTENSE. TO HELP ATTRACT, RETAIN, AND MOTIVATE QUALIFIED EMPLOYEES, WE USE SHARE-BASED AND OTHER PERFORMANCE-BASED INCENTIVE AWARDS SUCH AS RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS (RSUS) AND CASH BONUSES. ALSO KEY TO OUR EMPLOYEE HIRING AND RETENTION IS OUR ABILITY TO BUILD AND MAINTAIN AN INCLUSIVE BUSINESS CULTURE AND BE VIEWED AS AN EMPLOYER OF CHOICE. IF OUR SHARE-BASED OR OTHER COMPENSATION PROGRAMS AND WORKPLACE CULTURE CEASE TO BE VIEWED AS COMPETITIVE, OUR ABILITY TO ATTRACT, RETAIN, AND MOTIVATE EMPLOYEES COULD BE WEAKENED, WHICH COULD HARM OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

WE ARE SUBJECT TO CYBERSECURITY AND PRIVACY RISKS.

THIRD PARTIES ATTEMPT TO GAIN UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS TO OUR NETWORK, PRODUCTS, SERVICES, AND INFRASTRUCTURE.

WE REGULARLY FACE ATTEMPTS BY OTHERS TO GAIN UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS THROUGH THE INTERNET OR TO INTRODUCE MALICIOUS SOFTWARE TO OUR INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY (IT) SYSTEMS. ADDITIONALLY, MALICIOUS HACKERS MAY ATTEMPT TO GAIN UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS AND CORRUPT THE PROCESSES OF HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE PRODUCTS THAT WE MANUFACTURE AND SERVICES WE PROVIDE. DUE TO THE WIDESPREAD USE OF OUR PRODUCTS AND THE HIGH PROFILE OF OUR COMMERCIAL SECURITY PRODUCTS, WE OR OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES ARE A FREQUENT TARGET OF COMPUTER HACKERS AND ORGANIZATIONS THAT INTEND TO SABOTAGE, TAKE CONTROL OF, OR OTHERWISE CORRUPT OUR MANUFACTURING OR OTHER PROCESSES, PRODUCTS, AND SERVICES. WE ARE ALSO A TARGET OF MALICIOUS ATTACKERS WHO ATTEMPT TO GAIN ACCESS TO OUR NETWORK OR DATA CENTERS OR THOSE OF OUR CUSTOMERS OR END USERS; STEAL PROPRIETARY INFORMATION RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS, PRODUCTS, EMPLOYEES, AND CUSTOMERS; OR INTERRUPT OUR SYSTEMS AND SERVICES OR THOSE OF OUR CUSTOMERS OR OTHERS. WE BELIEVE SUCH ATTEMPTS ARE INCREASING IN NUMBER AND IN TECHNICAL SOPHISTICATION. FROM TIME TO TIME, WE ENCOUNTER INTRUSIONS OR UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS TO OUR NETWORK, PRODUCTS, SERVICES, OR INFRASTRUCTURE. TO DATE, NONE HAVE RESULTED IN ANY MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT TO OUR BUSINESS OR OPERATIONS. IN SOME INSTANCES, WE, OUR CUSTOMERS, AND THE USERS OF OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES MIGHT BE UNAWARE OF AN INCIDENT OR ITS MAGNITUDE AND EFFECTS. WHILE WE SEEK TO DETECT AND INVESTIGATE ALL UNAUTHORIZED ATTEMPTS AND ATTACKS AGAINST OUR NETWORK, PRODUCTS, AND SERVICES, AND TO PREVENT THEIR RECURRENCE WHERE PRACTICABLE THROUGH CHANGES TO OUR INTERNAL PROCESSES AND TOOLS AND/OR CHANGES OR PATCHES TO OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, WE REMAIN POTENTIALLY VULNERABLE TO ADDITIONAL KNOWN OR UNKNOWN THREATS. SUCH INCIDENTS, WHETHER SUCCESSFUL OR UNSUCCESSFUL, COULD RESULT IN OUR INCURRING SIGNIFICANT COSTS RELATED TO, FOR EXAMPLE, REBUILDING INTERNAL SYSTEMS, REDUCED INVENTORY VALUE, PROVIDING MODIFICATIONS TO OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, DEFENDING AGAINST LITIGATION, RESPONDING TO REGULATORY INQUIRIES OR ACTIONS, PAYING DAMAGES, OR TAKING OTHER REMEDIAL STEPS WITH RESPECT TO THIRD PARTIES. IN ADDITION, THESE THREATS ARE CONSTANTLY EVOLVING, THEREBY INCREASING THE DIFFICULTY OF SUCCESSFULLY DEFENDING AGAINST THEM OR IMPLEMENTING ADEQUATE PREVENTATIVE MEASURES. PUBLICITY ABOUT VULNERABILITIES AND ATTEMPTED OR SUCCESSFUL INCURSIONS COULD DAMAGE OUR REPUTATION WITH CUSTOMERS OR USERS, AND REDUCE DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES.

WE MAY BE SUBJECT TO THEFT, LOSS, OR MISUSE OF PERSONAL DATA ABOUT OUR EMPLOYEES, CUSTOMERS, OR OTHER THIRD PARTIES, WHICH COULD INCREASE OUR EXPENSES, DAMAGE OUR REPUTATION, OR RESULT IN LEGAL OR REGULATORY PROCEEDINGS.

THE THEFT, LOSS, OR MISUSE OF PERSONAL DATA COLLECTED, USED, STORED, OR TRANSFERRED BY US TO RUN OUR BUSINESS COULD RESULT IN SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED SECURITY COSTS OR COSTS RELATED TO DEFENDING LEGAL CLAIMS. GLOBAL PRIVACY LEGISLATION, ENFORCEMENT, AND POLICY ACTIVITY IN THIS AREA ARE RAPIDLY EXPANDING AND CREATING A COMPLEX REGULATORY COMPLIANCE ENVIRONMENT. COSTS TO COMPLY WITH AND IMPLEMENT THESE PRIVACY-RELATED AND DATA PROTECTION MEASURES COULD BE SIGNIFICANT. IN ADDITION, EVEN OUR INADVERTENT FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH FEDERAL, STATE, OR INTERNATIONAL PRIVACY-RELATED OR DATA PROTECTION LAWS AND REGULATIONS COULD RESULT IN PROCEEDINGS AGAINST US BY GOVERNMENTAL ENTITIES OR OTHERS.

WE ARE SUBJECT TO RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH TRANSACTIONS.

WE INVEST IN COMPANIES FOR STRATEGIC REASONS AND MAY NOT REALIZE A RETURN ON OUR INVESTMENTS.

WE MAKE INVESTMENTS IN PUBLIC AND PRIVATE COMPANIES AROUND THE WORLD TO FURTHER OUR STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES AND SUPPORT KEY BUSINESS INITIATIVES. MANY OF THE INSTRUMENTS IN WHICH WE INVEST ARE NON-MARKETABLE AT THE TIME OF OUR INITIAL INVESTMENT. COMPANIES IN WHICH WE INVEST RANGE FROM EARLY-STAGE COMPANIES STILL DEFINING THEIR STRATEGIC DIRECTION TO MATURE COMPANIES WITH ESTABLISHED REVENUE STREAMS AND BUSINESS MODELS. THE SUCCESS OF OUR INVESTMENT IN ANY COMPANY IS TYPICALLY DEPENDENT ON THE AVAILABILITY TO THE COMPANY OF ADDITIONAL FUNDING ON FAVORABLE TERMS, OR A LIQUIDITY EVENT, SUCH AS A PUBLIC OFFERING OR ACQUISITION. IF ANY OF THE COMPANIES IN WHICH WE INVEST FAIL, WE COULD LOSE ALL OR PART OF OUR INVESTMENT.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

OUR ACQUISITIONS, DIVESTITURES, AND OTHER TRANSACTIONS COULD FAIL TO ACHIEVE STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES, DISRUPT OUR ONGOING BUSINESS, AND HARM OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

IN PURSUING

OUR BUSINESS STRATEGY, WE ROUTINELY CONDUCT DISCUSSIONS, EVALUATE OPPORTUNITIES, AND ENTER INTO AGREEMENTS FOR POSSIBLE ACQUISITIONS, DIVESTITURES, AND OTHER TRANSACTIONS, SUCH AS JOINT VENTURES. GIVEN THAT OUR RESOURCES ARE LIMITED, OUR DECISION TO PURSUE A TRANSACTION HAS OPPORTUNITY COSTS; ACCORDINGLY, IF WE PURSUE A PARTICULAR TRANSACTION, WE MAY NEED TO FORGO THE PROSPECT OF ENTERING INTO OTHER TRANSACTIONS THAT COULD HELP US ACHIEVE OUR STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES. IN ADDITION TO OPPORTUNITY COSTS, THESE TRANSACTIONS INVOLVE LARGE CHALLENGES AND RISKS, INCLUDING RISKS THAT.



THE TRANSACTION MAY NOT ADVANCE OUR BUSINESS STRATEGY;



WE MAY BE UNABLE TO IDENTIFY OPPORTUNITIES ON TERMS ACCEPTABLE TO US;



WE MAY NOT REALIZE A SATISFACTORY RETURN;



WE MAY EXPERIENCE DISRUPTION OF OUR ONGOING OPERATIONS;



WE MAY BE UNABLE TO RETAIN KEY PERSONNEL;



WE MAY EXPERIENCE DIFFICULTY IN INTEGRATING NEW EMPLOYEES, BUSINESS SYSTEMS, AND TECHNOLOGY;



ACQUIRED BUSINESSES MAY NOT HAVE ADEQUATE CONTROLS, PROCESSES, AND PROCEDURES TO ENSURE COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS AND REGULATIONS, AND OUR DUE DILIGENCE PROCESS MAY NOT IDENTIFY COMPLIANCE ISSUES OR OTHER LIABILITIES;



WE MAY HAVE DIFFICULTY ENTERING NEW MARKET SEGMENTS;



WE MAY BE UNABLE TO RETAIN THE CUSTOMERS AND PARTNERS OF ACQUIRED BUSINESSES; AND/OR



THERE MAY BE UNKNOWN, UNDERESTIMATED, AND/OR UNDISCLOSED COMMITMENTS OR LIABILITIES.

WHEN WE DECIDE TO SELL ASSETS OR A BUSINESS, WE MAY HAVE DIFFICULTY SELLING ON ACCEPTABLE TERMS IN A TIMELY MANNER, AND THE AGREED-UPON TERMS AND FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS COULD BE RENEGOTIATED DUE TO CHANGES IN BUSINESS OR MARKET CONDITIONS. THESE CIRCUMSTANCES COULD DELAY THE ACHIEVEMENT OF OUR STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES OR CAUSE US TO INCUR ADDITIONAL EXPENSE, OR WE MAY SELL A BUSINESS AT A PRICE OR ON TERMS THAT ARE LESS FAVORABLE THAN WE HAD ANTICIPATED, RESULTING IN A LOSS ON THE TRANSACTION.

IF WE DO ENTER INTO AGREEMENTS WITH RESPECT TO ACQUISITIONS, DIVESTITURES, OR OTHER TRANSACTIONS, WE MAY FAIL TO COMPLETE THEM DUE TO FACTORS SUCH AS.



FAILURE TO OBTAIN REGULATORY OR OTHER APPROVALS;



IP DISPUTES OR OTHER LITIGATION; OR



DIFFICULTIES OBTAINING FINANCING FOR THE TRANSACTION.

WE ARE SUBJECT TO SALES-RELATED RISKS.

WE FACE RISKS RELATED TO SALES THROUGH DISTRIBUTORS AND OTHER THIRD PARTIES.

WE SELL A SIGNIFICANT PORTION

OF OUR PRODUCTS THROUGH THIRD PARTIES SUCH AS DISTRIBUTORS, VALUE-ADDED RESELLERS, AND CHANNEL PARTNERS (COLLECTIVELY REFERRED TO AS DISTRIBUTORS) AS WELL AS OEMS, ODMS AND INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDERS. WE DEPEND ON MANY DISTRIBUTORS TO HELP US CREATE END CUSTOMER DEMAND, PROVIDE TECHNICAL SUPPORT AND OTHER VALUE-ADDED SERVICES TO CUSTOMERS, FILL CUSTOMER ORDERS, AND STOCK OUR PRODUCTS. WE MAY RELY ON ONE OR MORE KEY DISTRIBUTORS FOR A PRODUCT, AND A MATERIAL CHANGE IN OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH ONE OR MORE OF THESE DISTRIBUTORS OR THEIR FAILURE TO PERFORM AS EXPECTED COULD REDUCE OUR REVENUE. OUR ABILITY TO ADD OR REPLACE DISTRIBUTORS FOR SOME OF OUR PRODUCTS MAY BE LIMITED. IN ADDITION, OUR DISTRIBUTORS' EXPERTISE IN THE DETERMINATION AND STOCKING OF ACCEPTABLE INVENTORY LEVELS FOR SOME OF OUR PRODUCTS MAY NOT BE EASILY TRANSFERABLE TO A NEW DISTRIBUTOR; AS A RESULT, END CUSTOMERS MAY BE HESITANT TO ACCEPT THE ADDITION OR REPLACEMENT OF A DISTRIBUTOR. USING THIRD PARTIES FOR DISTRIBUTION EXPOSES US TO MANY RISKS, INCLUDING COMPETITIVE PRESSURE, CONCENTRATION, CREDIT RISK, AND COMPLIANCE RISKS. DISTRIBUTORS AND OTHER THIRD PARTIES MAY SELL PRODUCTS THAT COMPETE WITH OUR PRODUCTS, AND WE MAY NEED TO PROVIDE FINANCIAL AND OTHER INCENTIVES TO FOCUS THEM ON THE SALE OF OUR PRODUCTS. THEY MAY FACE FINANCIAL DIFFICULTIES, INCLUDING BANKRUPTCY, WHICH COULD HARM OUR COLLECTION OF ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND FINANCIAL RESULTS. VIOLATIONS OF THE FOREIGN CORRUPT PRACTICES ACT OR SIMILAR LAWS BY DISTRIBUTORS OR OTHER THIRD-PARTY INTERMEDIARIES COULD HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR BUSINESS. FAILURE TO MANAGE RISKS RELATED TO OUR USE OF DISTRIBUTORS AND OTHER THIRD PARTIES MAY REDUCE SALES, INCREASE EXPENSES, AND WEAKEN OUR COMPETITIVE POSITION.

U.S. GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS ARE SUBJECT TO OVERSIGHT, INCLUDING SPECIAL RULES ON ACCOUNTING, IP RIGHTS, EXPENSES, REVIEWS, INFORMATION HANDLING, AND SECURITY. FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH THESE RULES COULD RESULT IN CIVIL AND CRIMINAL PENALTIES AND SANCTIONS, INCLUDING TERMINATION OF CONTRACTS, FINES, AND SUSPENSIONS, OR DEBARMENT FROM FUTURE U.S. GOVERNMENT BUSINESS.

OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COULD VARY AS A RESULT OF THE METHODS, ESTIMATES, AND JUDGMENTS THAT WE USE IN APPLYING ACCOUNTING POLICIES.

THE METHODS, ESTIMATES, AND JUDGMENTS USED IN APPLYING ACCOUNTING POLICIES ARE SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT RISKS, UNCERTAINTIES, ASSUMPTIONS, AND CHANGES THAT COULD AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL POSITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. FOR MORE INFORMATION, SEE "CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES" IN PART II, ITEM 7 AND "NOTE 2: ACCOUNTING POLICIES" IN PART II, ITEM 8 OF THIS FORM 10-K.

CHANGES IN OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE MAY REDUCE OUR NET INCOME.

A NUMBER OF FACTORS MAY INCREASE OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATES, WHICH COULD REDUCE OUR NET INCOME, INCLUDING.

THE RESOLUTION OF ISSUES ARISING FROM TAX AUDITS;



CHANGES IN THE VALUATION OF OUR DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, AND IN DEFERRED TAX VALUATION ALLOWANCES;

WORKFORCE RESTRUCTURING ACTIONS MAY BE DISRUPTIVE TO OUR OPERATIONS AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS.

IN RESPONSE TO THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT AND TO ACCOMPLISH OUR STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES, WE HAVE ANNOUNCED RESTRUCTURINGS OF OUR OPERATIONS AND HAVE MADE OTHER ADJUSTMENTS TO OUR WORKFORCE. WE MAY PURSUE SIMILAR ACTIONS IN THE FUTURE, AND SUCH WORKFORCE CHANGES CAN RESULT IN RESTRUCTURING CHARGES IN ADDITION TO THOSE DESCRIBED IN "

NOTE 7: RESTRUCTURING AND OTHER CHARGES

" IN PART II, ITEM 8 OF THIS FORM 10-K. ANY SUCH WORKFORCE CHANGES CAN ALSO TEMPORARILY REDUCE WORKFORCE PRODUCTIVITY, WHICH COULD BE DISRUPTIVE TO OUR BUSINESS AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. IN ADDITION, IF OUR RESTRUCTURINGS ARE PERCEIVED NEGATIVELY, OUR CORPORATE REPUTATION AND ABILITY TO ATTRACT EMPLOYEES COULD SUFFER. MOREOVER, WE MAY NOT ACHIEVE OR SUSTAIN THE EXPECTED COST SAVINGS OR OTHER BENEFITS OF OUR RESTRUCTURING PLANS, OR DO SO WITHIN THE EXPECTED TIME FRAME.

ADDITIONAL FACTORS THAT COULD CAUSE ACTUAL RESULTS TO DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM OUR EXPECTATIONS WITH REGARD TO OUR RESTRUCTURING ACTIVITY INCLUDE.



TIMING AND EXECUTION OF PLANS AND PROGRAMS THAT MAY BE SUBJECT TO LOCAL LABOR LAW REQUIREMENTS, INCLUDING CONSULTATION WITH APPROPRIATE WORKS COUNCILS;

THERE ARE INHERENT LIMITATIONS ON THE EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR CONTROLS.

WE DO NOT EXPECT THAT OUR DISCLOSURE CONTROLS OR OUR INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING WILL PREVENT OR DETECT ALL ERRORS AND ALL FRAUD. A CONTROL SYSTEM, NO MATTER HOW WELL-DESIGNED AND OPERATED, CAN PROVIDE ONLY REASONABLE, NOT ABSOLUTE, ASSURANCE THAT THE CONTROL SYSTEMS OBJECTIVES WILL BE MET. THE DESIGN OF A CONTROL SYSTEM MUST REFLECT THE FACT THAT RESOURCE CONSTRAINTS EXIST, AND THE BENEFITS OF CONTROLS MUST BE CONSIDERED RELATIVE TO THEIR COSTS. FURTHER, BECAUSE OF THE INHERENT LIMITATIONS IN ALL CONTROL SYSTEMS, NO EVALUATION OF CONTROLS CAN PROVIDE ABSOLUTE ASSURANCE THAT MISSTATEMENTS DUE TO ERROR OR FRAUD WILL NOT OCCUR OR THAT ALL CONTROL ISSUES AND INSTANCES OF FRAUD, IF ANY, HAVE BEEN DETECTED. THE DESIGN OF ANY SYSTEM OF CONTROLS IS BASED IN PART ON CERTAIN ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT THE LIKELIHOOD OF FUTURE EVENTS, AND THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT ANY DESIGN WILL SUCCEED IN ACHIEVING ITS STATED GOALS UNDER ALL POTENTIAL FUTURE CONDITIONS. PROJECTIONS OF ANY EVALUATION OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF CONTROLS TO FUTURE PERIODS ARE SUBJECT TO RISKS. OVER TIME, CONTROLS MAY BECOME INADEQUATE DUE TO CHANGES IN CONDITIONS OR DETERIORATION IN THE DEGREE OF COMPLIANCE WITH POLICIES OR PROCEDURES. IF OUR CONTROLS BECOME INADEQUATE, WE COULD FAIL TO MEET OUR FINANCIAL REPORTING OBLIGATIONS, OUR REPUTATION MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED, OUR BUSINESS AND OPERATING RESULTS COULD BE HARMED, AND THE MARKET PRICE OF OUR STOCK COULD DECLINE.
