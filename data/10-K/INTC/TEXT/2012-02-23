COMPETITION

OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS, THE NUMBER AND VARIETY OF COMPUTING DEVICES HAVE EXPANDED RAPIDLY, CREATING A CONNECTED COMPUTING LANDSCAPE THAT EXTENDS FROM THE LARGEST SUPERCOMPUTERS AND DATA CENTERS TO THE SMALLEST

MOBILE AND EMBEDDED DEVICES. THERE ARE FREQUENT PRODUCT INTRODUCTIONS, AND THESE PRODUCTS ARE BECOMING INCREASINGLY CAPABLE. THE COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT IN THE COMPUTING INDUSTRY IS IN A CONSTANT STATE OF FLUX, AS CUSTOMERS AND COLLABORATORS IN ONE

PART OF OUR BUSINESS CAN QUICKLY BECOME COMPETITORS IN ANOTHER. NEW MARKET SEGMENTS CAN EMERGE RAPIDLY. WE ARE FOCUSED ON OUR STRATEGY TO EXPAND INTO MARKET SEGMENTS BEYOND OUR TRADITIONAL PC AND SERVER BUSINESSESINCLUDING CONSUMER ELECTRONICS

DEVICES, EMBEDDED APPLICATIONS, SMARTPHONES, AND TABLETSWHERE WE FACE SEVERAL INCUMBENT SUPPLIERS.

ONE OF OUR IMPORTANT COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGES IS

THE COMBINATION OF OUR NETWORK OF MANUFACTURING AND ASSEMBLY AND TEST FACILITIES WITH OUR GLOBAL ARCHITECTURE DESIGN TEAMS. THIS NETWORK ENABLES US TO HAVE MORE DIRECT CONTROL OVER OUR PROCESSES, QUALITY CONTROL, PRODUCT COST, PRODUCTION TIMING,

PERFORMANCE, AND OTHER FACTORS. MOST OF OUR COMPETITORS RELY ON THIRD-PARTY FOUNDRIES AND SUBCONTRACTORS SUCH AS TAIWAN SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING COMPANY, LTD. OR GLOBALFOUNDRIES INC. FOR THEIR MANUFACTURING AND ASSEMBLY AND TEST NEEDS.

OUR PROCESS TECHNOLOGY LEADERSHIP ALLOWS US TO SHRINK THE SIZE OF OUR TRANSISTORS, OPTIMIZING POWER AND PERFORMANCE CHARACTERISTICS AND IMPROVING OUR

ABILITY TO ADD MORE TRANSISTORS AND FEATURES. THIS LEADS TO MORE POWERFUL, ENERGY-EFFICIENT MICROPROCESSORS. WE BELIEVE THAT AS THE NEED FOR COMPUTING POWER IN SMARTPHONES AND TABLETS GROWS, OUR ABILITY TO ADD TRANSISTORS WILL BECOME AN IMPORTANT

COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE FOR OUR OFFERINGS IN THOSE MARKET SEGMENTS.

OUR PLATFORMS PRIMARILY COMPETE BASED ON PERFORMANCE, ENERGY EFFICIENCY, INNOVATIVE

DESIGN AND FEATURES, PRICE, QUALITY AND RELIABILITY, BRAND RECOGNITION, AND AVAILABILITY. OTHER IMPORTANT COMPETITIVE FACTORS INCLUDE DEVELOPMENT OF

THE SOFTWARE ECOSYSTEM, SECURITY, CONNECTIVITY, AND COMPATIBILITY WITH OTHER DEVICES IN THE COMPUTING CONTINUUM. THE ABILITY OF OUR ARCHITECTURE TO SUPPORT MULTIPLE OPERATING SYSTEMS, INCLUDING

LEGACY ENVIRONMENTS BASED ON X86, IS AN ADVANTAGE IN OFFERING OEM CUSTOMERS OPERATING SYSTEM CHOICES. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR PLATFORM STRATEGY TO INTEGRATE MULTIPLE HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE TECHNOLOGIES GIVES US A SIGNIFICANT COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE.

FOR MANY YEARS, ADVANCED MICRO DEVICES, INC. (AMD) HAS BEEN OUR PRIMARY COMPETITOR IN THE MARKET SEGMENTS FOR PLATFORMS USED IN NOTEBOOKS AND DESKTOPS.

AMD ALSO COMPETES WITH US IN THE SERVER MARKET SEGMENT ALONG WITH INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS MACHINES CORPORATION (IBM) AND ORACLE CORPORATION. COMPANIES OFFERING ARM LIMITED (ARM) BASED DESIGNS ARE ALSO ATTEMPTING TO EXPAND INTO THE NOTEBOOK, DESKTOP,

AND SERVER MARKET SEGMENTS. IN ADDITION, OUR PLATFORMS WITH INTEGRATED GRAPHICS AND CHIPSETS COMPETE WITH NVIDIA CORPORATIONS GRAPHICS PROCESSORS; NVIDIA HAS SHIFTED SOME OF THE WORKLOAD TRADITIONALLY PERFORMED BY THE MICROPROCESSOR TO ITS

GRAPHICS PROCESSOR.

COMPANIES USING ARM OR MIPS TECHNOLOGIES, INC. (MIPS) BASED DESIGNS ARE OUR PRIMARY COMPETITORS IN THE CONSUMER ELECTRONICS DEVICES

AND EMBEDDED APPLICATIONS MARKET SEGMENTS. IN SMARTPHONES AND TABLETS, WE FACE ESTABLISHED COMPETITORS SUCH AS QUALCOMM INCORPORATED, NVIDIA, AND TEXAS INSTRUMENTS INCORPORATED, WHICH DELIVER SOC SOLUTIONS BASED ON THE ARM ARCHITECTURE AND

COMPLEMENTARY WIRELESS TECHNOLOGIES, AS WELL AS COMPANIES THAT INCORPORATE SOC SOLUTIONS THAT THEY MANUFACTURE. THE PRIMARY COMPETITOR FOR MCAFEES FAMILY OF SECURITY PRODUCTS AND SERVICES IS SYMANTEC CORPORATION.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2011, A SUBSTANTIAL MAJORITY OF OUR MICROPROCESSORS WERE MANUFACTURED ON 300-MILLIMETER (MM)

WAFERS USING OUR 32NM PROCESS TECHNOLOGY. IN THE SECOND HALF OF 2011, WE BEGAN MANUFACTURING MICROPROCESSORS USING OUR 22NM PROCESS TECHNOLOGY. AS WE MOVE TO EACH SUCCEEDING GENERATION OF MANUFACTURING PROCESS TECHNOLOGY, WE INCUR SIGNIFICANT

START-UP COSTS TO PREPARE EACH FACTORY FOR MANUFACTURING. HOWEVER, CONTINUING TO ADVANCE OUR PROCESS TECHNOLOGY PROVIDES BENEFITS THAT WE BELIEVE JUSTIFY THESE COSTS. THE BENEFITS OF MOVING TO EACH SUCCEEDING GENERATION OF MANUFACTURING PROCESS

TECHNOLOGY CAN INCLUDE USING LESS SPACE PER TRANSISTOR, REDUCING HEAT OUTPUT FROM EACH TRANSISTOR, AND INCREASING THE NUMBER OF INTEGRATED FEATURES ON EACH CHIP. THESE ADVANCEMENTS CAN RESULT IN MICROPROCESSORS THAT ARE HIGHER PERFORMING, CONSUME

LESS POWER, AND COST LESS TO MANUFACTURE. IN ADDITION, WITH EACH SHIFT TO A NEW PROCESS TECHNOLOGY, WE ARE ABLE TO PRODUCE MORE MICROPROCESSORS PER SQUARE FOOT OF OUR WAFER FABRICATION FACILITIES. THE COSTS TO DEVELOP OUR PROCESS TECHNOLOGY ARE

SIGNIFICANTLY LESS THAN ADDING CAPACITY BY BUILDING ADDITIONAL WAFER FABRICATION FACILITIES USING OLDER PROCESS TECHNOLOGY.

WE USE THIRD-PARTY

MANUFACTURING COMPANIES (FOUNDRIES) TO MANUFACTURE WAFERS FOR CERTAIN COMPONENTS, INCLUDING NETWORKING AND COMMUNICATIONS PRODUCTS. IN ADDITION, WE PRIMARILY USE SUBCONTRACTORS TO MANUFACTURE BOARD-LEVEL PRODUCTS AND SYSTEMS, AND PURCHASE CERTAIN

COMMUNICATIONS NETWORKING PRODUCTS AND MOBILE PHONE COMPONENTS FROM EXTERNAL VENDORS PRIMARILY IN THE ASIA-PACIFIC REGION.

FOLLOWING THE MANUFACTURING

PROCESS, THE MAJORITY OF OUR COMPONENTS ARE SUBJECT TO ASSEMBLY AND TEST. WE PERFORM OUR COMPONENTS ASSEMBLY AND TEST AT FACILITIES IN MALAYSIA, CHINA, COSTA RICA, AND VIETNAM. TO AUGMENT CAPACITY, WE USE SUBCONTRACTORS TO PERFORM ASSEMBLY OF

CERTAIN PRODUCTS, PRIMARILY CHIPSETS AND NETWORKING AND COMMUNICATIONS PRODUCTS. IN ADDITION, WE USE SUBCONTRACTORS TO PERFORM ASSEMBLY AND TEST OF OUR MOBILE PHONE COMPONENTS.

OUR NAND FLASH MEMORY PRODUCTS ARE MANUFACTURED BY IMFT AND IMFS USING 20NM, 25NM, 34NM, OR 50NM PROCESS TECHNOLOGY, AND ASSEMBLY AND TEST OF THESE PRODUCTS IS PERFORMED BY MICRON TECHNOLOGY, INC. AND OTHER

EXTERNAL SUBCONTRACTORS. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION, SEE NOTE 11: EQUITY METHOD AND COST METHOD INVESTMENTS IN PART II, ITEM 8 OF THIS FORM 10-K.

OUR EMPLOYMENT PRACTICES ARE CONSISTENT WITH, AND WE EXPECT OUR SUPPLIERS AND SUBCONTRACTORS TO ABIDE BY, LOCAL COUNTRY LAW. IN ADDITION, WE IMPOSE A MINIMUM EMPLOYEE AGE REQUIREMENT AS WELL AS PROGRESSIVE

ENVIRONMENTAL, HEALTH, AND SAFETY (EHS) REQUIREMENTS, REGARDLESS OF LOCAL LAW.

WE HAVE THOUSANDS OF SUPPLIERS, INCLUDING SUBCONTRACTORS, PROVIDING OUR VARIOUS MATERIALS AND SERVICE NEEDS. WE SET

EXPECTATIONS FOR SUPPLIER PERFORMANCE AND REINFORCE THOSE EXPECTATIONS WITH PERIODIC ASSESSMENTS. WE COMMUNICATE THOSE EXPECTATIONS TO OUR SUPPLIERS REGULARLY AND WORK WITH THEM TO IMPLEMENT IMPROVEMENTS WHEN NECESSARY. WE SEEK, WHERE POSSIBLE, TO

HAVE SEVERAL SOURCES OF SUPPLY FOR ALL OF THESE MATERIALS AND RESOURCES, BUT WE MAY RELY ON A SINGLE OR LIMITED NUMBER OF SUPPLIERS, OR UPON SUPPLIERS IN A SINGLE COUNTRY. IN THOSE CASES, WE DEVELOP AND IMPLEMENT PLANS AND ACTIONS TO REDUCE THE

EXPOSURE THAT WOULD RESULT FROM A DISRUPTION IN SUPPLY. WE HAVE ENTERED INTO LONG-TERM CONTRACTS WITH CERTAIN SUPPLIERS TO ENSURE A PORTION OF OUR SILICON SUPPLY.

OUR PRODUCTS ARE TYPICALLY PRODUCED AT MULTIPLE INTEL FACILITIES AT VARIOUS SITES AROUND THE WORLD, OR BY SUBCONTRACTORS THAT HAVE MULTIPLE FACILITIES. HOWEVER, SOME PRODUCTS ARE PRODUCED IN ONLY ONE INTEL OR

SUBCONTRACTOR FACILITY, AND WE SEEK TO IMPLEMENT ACTION PLANS TO REDUCE THE EXPOSURE THAT WOULD RESULT FROM A DISRUPTION AT ANY SUCH FACILITY. SEE RISK FACTORS IN PART I, ITEM 1A OF THIS FORM 10-K.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

WE ARE COMMITTED

TO INVESTING IN WORLD-CLASS TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT, PARTICULARLY IN THE DESIGN AND MANUFACTURE OF INTEGRATED CIRCUITS. RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT (R&D) EXPENDITURES WERE $8.4 BILLION IN 2011 ($6.6 BILLION IN 2010 AND $5.7 BILLION IN

2009).

OUR R&D ACTIVITIES ARE DIRECTED TOWARD DEVELOPING THE TECHNOLOGY INNOVATIONS (SUCH AS THREE-DIMENSIONAL TRI-GATE AND HI-K METAL GATE

TRANSISTOR TECHNOLOGIES) THAT WE BELIEVE WILL DELIVER OUR NEXT GENERATION OF PRODUCTS, WHICH WILL IN TURN ENABLE NEW FORM FACTORS AND USAGE MODELS FOR BUSINESSES AND CONSUMERS. OUR R&D ACTIVITIES RANGE FROM DESIGNING AND DEVELOPING NEW PRODUCTS

AND MANUFACTURING PROCESSES TO RESEARCHING FUTURE TECHNOLOGIES AND PRODUCTS.

WE ARE FOCUSING OUR R&D EFFORTS ON ADVANCED COMPUTING TECHNOLOGIES,

DEVELOPING NEW MICROARCHITECTURES, ADVANCING OUR SILICON MANUFACTURING PROCESS TECHNOLOGY, DELIVERING THE NEXT GENERATION OF MICROPROCESSORS AND CHIPSETS, IMPROVING OUR PLATFORM INITIATIVES, AND DEVELOPING SOFTWARE SOLUTIONS AND TOOLS TO SUPPORT OUR

TECHNOLOGIES. OUR R&D EFFORTS ENABLE NEW LEVELS OF PERFORMANCE AND ADDRESS AREAS SUCH AS ENERGY EFFICIENCY, SECURITY, SCALABILITY FOR MULTI-CORE ARCHITECTURES, SYSTEM MANAGEABILITY, AND EASE OF USE. WE CONTINUE TO MAKE SIGNIFICANT R&D

INVESTMENTS IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF SOCS TO ENABLE GROWTH IN AREAS SUCH AS SMARTPHONES, TABLETS, AND EMBEDDED APPLICATIONS. IN ADDITION, WE CONTINUE TO MAKE SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS IN WIRELESS TECHNOLOGIES, GRAPHICS, AND HIGH-PERFORMANCE COMPUTING.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

AS PART OF OUR R&D EFFORTS, WE PLAN TO INTRODUCE A NEW MICROARCHITECTURE FOR OUR NOTEBOOK, ULTRABOOK SYSTEM,

DESKTOP, AND INTEL XEON PROCESSORS APPROXIMATELY EVERY TWO YEARS AND RAMP THE NEXT GENERATION OF SILICON PROCESS TECHNOLOGY IN THE INTERVENING YEARS. WE REFER TO THIS AS OUR TICK-TOCK TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT CADENCE. IN 2011, WE STARTED

MANUFACTURING PRODUCTS (FORMERLY CODE NAMED IVY BRIDGE) USING OUR NEW 22NM THREE-DIMENSIONAL TRI-GATE TRANSISTOR PROCESS TECHNOLOGY (22NM PROCESS TECHNOLOGY). THIS TECHNOLOGY IS THE FIRST TO USE A THREE-DIMENSIONAL TRANSISTOR DESIGN, WHICH IS

EXPECTED TO IMPROVE PERFORMANCE

AND ENERGY EFFICIENCY COMPARED TO THE EXISTING TWO-DIMENSIONAL TRANSISTOR STRUCTURE, AND SIGNIFICANTLY DECREASES THE POWER TARGETS FOR NOTEBOOK PROCESSORS. WE EXPECT TO BEGIN MANUFACTURING

PRODUCTS USING A NEW MICROARCHITECTURE USING OUR 22NM PROCESS TECHNOLOGY IN 2012. WE ARE CURRENTLY DEVELOPING 14NM PROCESS TECHNOLOGY, OUR NEXT-GENERATION PROCESS TECHNOLOGY, AND EXPECT TO BEGIN MANUFACTURING PRODUCTS USING THAT TECHNOLOGY IN 2013.

OUR LEADERSHIP IN SILICON TECHNOLOGY HAS ENABLED US TO MAKE MOORES LAW A REALITY. MOORES LAW PREDICTED THAT TRANSISTOR DENSITY ON INTEGRATED CIRCUITS WOULD DOUBLE ABOUT EVERY TWO YEARS.

OUR LEADERSHIP IN SILICON TECHNOLOGY HAS ALSO HELPED EXPAND ON THE ADVANCES ANTICIPATED BY MOORES LAW BY

BRINGING NEW CAPABILITIES INTO SILICON AND PRODUCING NEW PRODUCTS OPTIMIZED FOR A WIDER VARIETY OF APPLICATIONS. WE HAVE ACCELERATED THE INTEL ATOM PROCESSOR-BASED SOC ROADMAP FOR NETBOOKS, SMARTPHONES, TABLETS, AND OTHER DEVICES, FROM 32NM THROUGH

22NM TO 14NM WITHIN THREE SUCCESSIVE YEARS. INTEL ATOM PROCESSORS WILL EVENTUALLY BE ON THE SAME PROCESS TECHNOLOGY AS OUR LEADING-EDGE PRODUCTS. WE EXPECT THAT THIS ACCELERATION WILL RESULT IN A SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN TRANSISTOR LEAKAGE, LOWER

ACTIVE POWER, AND AN INCREASE IN TRANSISTOR DENSITY TO ENABLE MORE POWERFUL SMARTPHONES, TABLETS, AND NETBOOKS WITH MORE FEATURES AND LONGER BATTERY LIFE.

OUR R&D MODEL IS BASED ON A GLOBAL ORGANIZATION THAT EMPHASIZES A COLLABORATIVE APPROACH TO IDENTIFYING AND DEVELOPING NEW TECHNOLOGIES, LEADING STANDARDS INITIATIVES, AND INFLUENCING REGULATORY POLICIES TO

ACCELERATE THE ADOPTION OF NEW TECHNOLOGIES, INCLUDING JOINT PATHFINDING CONDUCTED BETWEEN RESEARCHERS AT INTEL LABS AND OUR BUSINESS GROUPS. WE CENTRALLY MANAGE KEY CROSS-BUSINESS GROUP PRODUCT INITIATIVES TO ALIGN AND PRIORITIZE OUR R&D

ACTIVITIES ACROSS THESE GROUPS. IN ADDITION, WE MAY AUGMENT OUR R&D ACTIVITIES BY INVESTING IN COMPANIES OR ENTERING INTO AGREEMENTS WITH COMPANIES THAT HAVE SIMILAR R&D FOCUS AREAS, AS WELL AS DIRECTLY PURCHASING INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

RIGHTS (IP) APPLICABLE TO OUR R&D INITIATIVES.

EMPLOYEES

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2011, WE HAD 100,100 EMPLOYEES WORLDWIDE (82,500 AS OF DECEMBER 25, 2010), WITH APPROXIMATELY 55% OF THOSE EMPLOYEES LOCATED IN THE U.S. (55% AS OF DECEMBER 25, 2010). THE MAJORITY

OF THE INCREASE IN EMPLOYEES WAS DUE TO EMPLOYEES HIRED AS A RESULT OF THE ACQUISITIONS OF MCAFEE AND THE WLS BUSINESS OF INFINEON.

SALES AND MARKETING

CUSTOMERS

WE SELL OUR PRODUCTS

PRIMARILY TO OEMS AND ODMS. ODMS PROVIDE DESIGN AND/OR MANUFACTURING SERVICES TO BRANDED AND UNBRANDED PRIVATE-LABEL RESELLERS. IN ADDITION, WE SELL OUR PRODUCTS TO OTHER MANUFACTURERS, INCLUDING MAKERS OF A WIDE RANGE OF INDUSTRIAL AND

COMMUNICATIONS EQUIPMENT. OUR CUSTOMERS ALSO INCLUDE THOSE WHO BUY PC COMPONENTS AND OUR OTHER PRODUCTS THROUGH DISTRIBUTOR, RESELLER, RETAIL, AND OEM CHANNELS THROUGHOUT THE WORLD.

OUR WORLDWIDE RESELLER SALES CHANNEL CONSISTS OF THOUSANDS OF INDIRECT CUSTOMERSSYSTEMS BUILDERS THAT PURCHASE INTEL MICROPROCESSORS AND OTHER PRODUCTS FROM OUR DISTRIBUTORS. WE HAVE A BOXED PROCESSOR

PROGRAM THAT ALLOWS DISTRIBUTORS TO SELL INTEL MICROPROCESSORS IN SMALL QUANTITIES TO THESE SYSTEMS-BUILDER CUSTOMERS; BOXED PROCESSORS ARE ALSO AVAILABLE IN DIRECT RETAIL OUTLETS.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

IN 2011, HEWLETT-PACKARD COMPANY ACCOUNTED FOR 19% OF OUR NET REVENUE (21% IN 2010 AND 2009) AND DELL INC. ACCOUNTED

FOR 15% OF OUR NET REVENUE (17% IN 2010 AND 2009). NO OTHER CUSTOMER ACCOUNTED FOR MORE THAN 10% OF OUR NET REVENUE. FOR INFORMATION ABOUT REVENUE AND OPERATING INCOME BY OPERATING SEGMENT, AND REVENUE FROM UNAFFILIATED CUSTOMERS BY GEOGRAPHIC

REGION/COUNTRY, SEE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN PART II, ITEM 7 AND NOTE 30: OPERATING SEGMENT AND GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION IN PART II, ITEM 8 OF THIS FORM 10-K.

SALES ARRANGEMENTS

OUR PRODUCTS ARE

SOLD THROUGH SALES OFFICES THROUGHOUT THE WORLD. SALES OF OUR PRODUCTS ARE TYPICALLY MADE VIA PURCHASE ORDER ACKNOWLEDGMENTS THAT CONTAIN STANDARD TERMS AND CONDITIONS COVERING MATTERS SUCH AS PRICING, PAYMENT TERMS, AND WARRANTIES, AS WELL AS

INDEMNITIES FOR ISSUES SPECIFIC TO OUR PRODUCTS, SUCH AS PATENT AND COPYRIGHT INDEMNITIES. FROM TIME TO TIME, WE MAY ENTER INTO ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS WITH CUSTOMERS COVERING, FOR EXAMPLE, CHANGES FROM OUR STANDARD TERMS AND CONDITIONS, NEW PRODUCT

DEVELOPMENT AND MARKETING, PRIVATE-LABEL BRANDING, AND OTHER MATTERS. MOST OF OUR SALES ARE MADE USING ELECTRONIC AND WEB-BASED PROCESSES THAT ALLOW THE CUSTOMER TO REVIEW INVENTORY AVAILABILITY AND TRACK THE PROGRESS OF SPECIFIC GOODS ORDERED.

PRICING ON PARTICULAR PRODUCTS MAY VARY BASED ON VOLUMES ORDERED AND OTHER FACTORS. WE ALSO OFFER DISCOUNTS, REBATES, AND OTHER INCENTIVES TO CUSTOMERS TO INCREASE ACCEPTANCE OF OUR PRODUCTS AND TECHNOLOGY.

OUR PRODUCTS ARE TYPICALLY SHIPPED UNDER TERMS THAT TRANSFER TITLE TO THE CUSTOMER, EVEN IN ARRANGEMENTS FOR WHICH THE RECOGNITION OF REVENUE AND RELATED COSTS OF

SALES IS DEFERRED. OUR STANDARD TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF SALE TYPICALLY PROVIDE THAT PAYMENT IS DUE AT A LATER DATE, GENERALLY 30 DAYS AFTER SHIPMENT OR DELIVERY. OUR CREDIT DEPARTMENT SETS ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND SHIPPING LIMITS FOR INDIVIDUAL

CUSTOMERS TO CONTROL CREDIT RISK TO INTEL ARISING FROM OUTSTANDING ACCOUNT BALANCES. WE ASSESS CREDIT RISK THROUGH QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE ANALYSIS, AND FROM THIS ANALYSIS, WE ESTABLISH CREDIT LIMITS AND DETERMINE WHETHER WE WILL USE ONE OR

MORE CREDIT SUPPORT DEVICES, SUCH AS A THIRD-PARTY GUARANTEE OR STANDBY LETTER OF CREDIT, OR CREDIT INSURANCE. CREDIT LOSSES MAY STILL BE INCURRED DUE TO BANKRUPTCY, FRAUD, OR OTHER FAILURE OF THE CUSTOMER TO PAY. FOR INFORMATION ABOUT OUR ALLOWANCE

FOR DOUBTFUL RECEIVABLES, SEE SCHEDULE IIVALUATION AND QUALIFYING ACCOUNTS IN PART IV OF THIS FORM 10-K.

MOST OF OUR

SALES TO DISTRIBUTORS ARE MADE UNDER AGREEMENTS ALLOWING FOR PRICE PROTECTION ON UNSOLD MERCHANDISE AND A RIGHT OF RETURN ON STIPULATED QUANTITIES OF UNSOLD MERCHANDISE. UNDER THE PRICE PROTECTION PROGRAM, WE GIVE DISTRIBUTORS CREDITS FOR THE

DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE ORIGINAL PRICE PAID AND THE CURRENT PRICE THAT WE OFFER. ON MOST PRODUCTS, THERE IS NO

CONTRACTUAL LIMIT ON THE AMOUNT OF PRICE PROTECTION, NOR IS THERE A LIMIT ON THE TIME HORIZON UNDER WHICH PRICE PROTECTION IS GRANTED. THE RIGHT OF RETURN GRANTED GENERALLY CONSISTS OF A STOCK

ROTATION PROGRAM IN WHICH DISTRIBUTORS ARE ABLE TO EXCHANGE CERTAIN PRODUCTS BASED ON THE NUMBER OF QUALIFIED PURCHASES MADE BY THE DISTRIBUTOR. WE HAVE THE OPTION TO GRANT CREDIT FOR, REPAIR, OR REPLACE DEFECTIVE PRODUCTS, AND THERE IS NO

CONTRACTUAL LIMIT ON THE AMOUNT OF CREDIT THAT MAY BE GRANTED TO A DISTRIBUTOR FOR DEFECTIVE PRODUCTS.

DISTRIBUTION

DISTRIBUTORS TYPICALLY HANDLE A WIDE VARIETY OF PRODUCTS, INCLUDING THOSE THAT COMPETE WITH OUR PRODUCTS, AND FILL ORDERS FOR MANY CUSTOMERS.

WE ALSO UTILIZE THIRD-PARTY SALES REPRESENTATIVES WHO GENERALLY DO NOT OFFER DIRECTLY COMPETITIVE PRODUCTS BUT MAY CARRY COMPLEMENTARY ITEMS MANUFACTURED BY OTHERS. SALES REPRESENTATIVES DO NOT MAINTAIN A PRODUCT INVENTORY; INSTEAD, THEIR CUSTOMERS

PLACE ORDERS DIRECTLY WITH US OR THROUGH DISTRIBUTORS. WE HAVE SEVERAL DISTRIBUTION WAREHOUSES THAT ARE LOCATED IN CLOSE PROXIMITY TO KEY CUSTOMERS.

BACKLOG

OVER TIME, OUR LARGER CUSTOMERS HAVE GENERALLY MOVED TO LEAN-INVENTORY OR

JUST-IN-TIME OPERATIONS RATHER THAN MAINTAINING LARGER INVENTORIES OF OUR PRODUCTS. WE HAVE ARRANGEMENTS WITH THESE CUSTOMERS TO SEEK TO QUICKLY FILL ORDERS FROM REGIONAL WAREHOUSES. AS A RESULT, OUR MANUFACTURING PRODUCTION IS BASED ON ESTIMATES

AND ADVANCE NON-BINDING COMMITMENTS FROM CUSTOMERS AS TO FUTURE PURCHASES. OUR ORDER BACKLOG AS OF ANY PARTICULAR DATE IS A MIX OF THESE COMMITMENTS AND SPECIFIC FIRM ORDERS THAT ARE MADE PRIMARILY PURSUANT TO STANDARD PURCHASE ORDERS FOR DELIVERY

OF PRODUCTS. ONLY A SMALL PORTION OF OUR ORDERS IS NON-CANCELABLE, AND THE DOLLAR AMOUNT ASSOCIATED WITH THE NON-CANCELABLE PORTION IS NOT SIGNIFICANT.

SEASONAL TRENDS

OUR PLATFORM SALES GENERALLY HAVE FOLLOWED A SEASONAL TREND.

HISTORICALLY, OUR SALES HAVE BEEN HIGHER IN THE SECOND HALF OF THE YEAR THAN IN THE FIRST HALF OF THE YEAR, ACCELERATING IN THE THIRD QUARTER AND PEAKING IN THE FOURTH QUARTER. CONSUMER AND BUSINESS PURCHASES OF PCS HAVE HISTORICALLY BEEN HIGHER IN

THE SECOND HALF OF THE YEAR.

PROCESSOR BRANDS.

WE PROMOTE BRAND AWARENESS AND GENERATE DEMAND THROUGH OUR OWN DIRECT MARKETING AS WELL AS CO-MARKETING PROGRAMS. OUR DIRECT

MARKETING ACTIVITIES INCLUDE TELEVISION, PRINT, AND INTERNET ADVERTISING, AS WELL AS PRESS RELATIONS, CONSUMER AND TRADE EVENTS, AND INDUSTRY AND CONSUMER COMMUNICATIONS. WE MARKET TO CONSUMER AND BUSINESS AUDIENCES, AND FOCUS ON BUILDING AWARENESS

AND GENERATING DEMAND FOR INCREASED PERFORMANCE, IMPROVED ENERGY EFFICIENCY, AND OTHER CAPABILITIES SUCH AS INTERNET CONNECTIVITY AND SECURITY.

PURCHASES BY CUSTOMERS OFTEN ALLOW THEM TO PARTICIPATE IN COOPERATIVE ADVERTISING AND MARKETING PROGRAMS SUCH AS THE INTEL INSIDE

®

PROGRAM. THIS PROGRAM BROADENS THE REACH OF OUR BRANDS BEYOND THE SCOPE OF OUR OWN DIRECT MARKETING. THROUGH THE INTEL INSIDE PROGRAM, CERTAIN CUSTOMERS ARE LICENSED

TO PLACE INTEL LOGOS ON COMPUTING DEVICES CONTAINING OUR MICROPROCESSORS AND PROCESSOR TECHNOLOGIES, AND TO USE OUR BRANDS IN THEIR MARKETING ACTIVITIES. THE PROGRAM INCLUDES A MARKET DEVELOPMENT COMPONENT THAT ACCRUES FUNDS BASED ON PURCHASES AND

PARTIALLY REIMBURSES THE OEMS FOR MARKETING ACTIVITIES FOR PRODUCTS FEATURING INTEL BRANDS, SUBJECT TO THE OEMS MEETING DEFINED CRITERIA. THESE MARKETING ACTIVITIES PRIMARILY INCLUDE TELEVISION, PRINT, AND INTERNET MARKETING. WE HAVE ALSO ENTERED

INTO JOINT MARKETING ARRANGEMENTS WITH CERTAIN CUSTOMERS.

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS AND LICENSING

IP THAT APPLIES TO OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES INCLUDES PATENTS, COPYRIGHTS, TRADE SECRETS, TRADEMARKS, AND MASKWORK RIGHTS. WE MAINTAIN A PROGRAM TO PROTECT OUR

INVESTMENT IN TECHNOLOGY BY ATTEMPTING TO ENSURE RESPECT FOR OUR IP. THE EXTENT OF THE LEGAL PROTECTION GIVEN TO DIFFERENT TYPES OF IP VARIES UNDER DIFFERENT COUNTRIES LEGAL SYSTEMS. WE INTEND TO LICENSE OUR IP WHERE WE CAN OBTAIN ADEQUATE

CONSIDERATION. SEE COMPETITION EARLIER IN THIS SECTION, RISK FACTORS IN PART I, ITEM 1A, AND NOTE 29: CONTINGENCIES IN PART II, ITEM 8 OF THIS FORM 10-K.

WE HAVE OBTAINED PATENTS IN THE U.S. AND OTHER COUNTRIES. WHILE OUR PATENTS ARE AN IMPORTANT ELEMENT OF OUR SUCCESS, OUR BUSINESS AS A WHOLE IS NOT SIGNIFICANTLY

DEPENDENT ON ANY ONE PATENT. BECAUSE OF THE FAST PACE OF INNOVATION AND

PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT, AND THE COMPARATIVE PACE OF GOVERNMENTS PATENTING PROCESSES, OUR PRODUCTS ARE OFTEN OBSOLETE BEFORE THE PATENTS RELATED TO THEM EXPIRE, AND MAY SOMETIMES BE OBSOLETE

BEFORE THE PATENTS RELATED TO THEM ARE EVEN GRANTED. AS WE EXPAND OUR PRODUCTS INTO NEW INDUSTRIES, WE ALSO SEEK TO EXTEND OUR PATENT DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS TO PATENT SUCH PRODUCTS. ESTABLISHED COMPETITORS IN EXISTING AND NEW INDUSTRIES, AS WELL AS

COMPANIES THAT PURCHASE AND ENFORCE PATENTS AND OTHER IP, MAY ALREADY HAVE PATENTS COVERING SIMILAR PRODUCTS. THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO OBTAIN PATENTS COVERING OUR OWN PRODUCTS, OR THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO OBTAIN LICENSES FROM

OTHER COMPANIES ON FAVORABLE TERMS OR AT ALL.

THE SOFTWARE THAT WE DISTRIBUTE, INCLUDING SOFTWARE EMBEDDED IN OUR COMPONENT-LEVEL AND SYSTEM-LEVEL

PRODUCTS, IS ENTITLED TO COPYRIGHT PROTECTION. TO DISTINGUISH INTEL PRODUCTS FROM OUR COMPETITORS PRODUCTS, WE HAVE OBTAINED TRADEMARKS AND TRADE NAMES FOR OUR PRODUCTS, AND WE MAINTAIN COOPERATIVE ADVERTISING PROGRAMS WITH CUSTOMERS TO

PROMOTE OUR BRANDS AND TO IDENTIFY PRODUCTS CONTAINING GENUINE INTEL COMPONENTS. WE ALSO PROTECT DETAILS ABOUT OUR PROCESSES, PRODUCTS, AND STRATEGIES AS TRADE SECRETS, KEEPING CONFIDENTIAL THE INFORMATION THAT WE BELIEVE PROVIDES US WITH A

COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE.

IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2011, WE ENTERED INTO A LONG-TERM PATENT CROSS-LICENSE AGREEMENT WITH NVIDIA. UNDER THE AGREEMENT, WE

RECEIVED A LICENSE TO ALL OF NVIDIAS PATENTS WITH A CAPTURE PERIOD THAT RUNS THROUGH MARCH 2017 WHILE NVIDIA PRODUCTS ARE LICENSED TO OUR PATENTS, SUBJECT TO EXCLUSIONS FOR X86 PRODUCTS, CERTAIN CHIPSETS, AND CERTAIN FLASH MEMORY TECHNOLOGY

PRODUCTS.

COMPLIANCE WITH ENVIRONMENTAL, HEALTH, AND SAFETY REGULATIONS

OUR COMPLIANCE EFFORTS FOCUS ON MONITORING REGULATORY AND RESOURCE TRENDS AND SETTING COMPANY-WIDE PERFORMANCE TARGETS FOR KEY RESOURCES AND EMISSIONS. THESE

TARGETS ADDRESS SEVERAL PARAMETERS, INCLUDING PRODUCT DESIGN; CHEMICAL, ENERGY, AND WATER USE; WASTE RECYCLING; THE SOURCE OF CERTAIN MINERALS USED IN OUR PRODUCTS; CLIMATE CHANGE; AND EMISSIONS.

INTEL FOCUSES ON REDUCING NATURAL RESOURCE USE, THE SOLID AND CHEMICAL WASTE BY-PRODUCTS OF OUR MANUFACTURING PROCESSES, AND THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT OF OUR

PRODUCTS. WE CURRENTLY USE A VARIETY OF MATERIALS IN OUR MANUFACTURING PROCESS THAT HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO ADVERSELY IMPACT THE ENVIRONMENT AND ARE SUBJECT TO A VARIETY OF EHS LAWS AND REGULATIONS. OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS, WE HAVE

SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED THE USE OF LEAD AND HALOGENATED FLAME RETARDANTS IN OUR PRODUCTS AND MANUFACTURING PROCESSES.

10

TABLE OF CONTENTS

WE WORK WITH THE U.S. ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY (EPA), NON-GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS, OEMS, AND RETAILERS TO

HELP MANAGE E-WASTE (WHICH INCLUDES ELECTRONIC PRODUCTS NEARING THE END OF THEIR USEFUL LIVES) AND PROMOTE RECYCLING. THE EUROPEAN UNION REQUIRES PRODUCERS OF CERTAIN ELECTRICAL AND ELECTRONIC EQUIPMENT TO DEVELOP PROGRAMS THAT ALLOW CONSUMERS TO

RETURN PRODUCTS FOR RECYCLING. MANY STATES IN THE U.S. HAVE SIMILAR E-WASTE TAKE-BACK LAWS. ALTHOUGH THESE LAWS ARE TYPICALLY TARGETED AT THE END ELECTRONIC PRODUCT AND NOT THE COMPONENT PRODUCTS THAT INTEL MANUFACTURES, THE INCONSISTENCY OF

MANY E-WASTE TAKE-BACK LAWS AND THE LACK OF LOCAL E-WASTE MANAGEMENT OPTIONS IN MANY AREAS POSE A CHALLENGE FOR OUR COMPLIANCE EFFORTS.

INTEL IS AN

INDUSTRY LEADER IN EFFORTS TO BUILD ETHICAL SOURCING OF MINERALS FOR OUR PRODUCTS. INTEL HAS PARTNERED WITH THE U.S. STATE DEPARTMENT AND THE U.S. AGENCY FOR INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT TO CREATE PILOT PROGRAMS THAT WOULD ALLOW FOR TRACKING AND

TRACING OF OUR SOURCE MATERIALS, IN PARTICULAR THOSE MINERALS SOURCED FROM THE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF THE CONGO. IN 2012, INTEL WILL CONTINUE TO WORK TO ESTABLISH A CONFLICT-FREE SUPPLY CHAIN FOR OUR COMPANY AND OUR INDUSTRY. INTELS GOAL

FOR 2012 IS TO VERIFY THAT THE TANTALUM WE USE IN OUR MICROPROCESSORS IS CONFLICT-FREE, AND OUR GOAL FOR 2013 IS TO MANUFACTURE THE WORLDS FIRST VERIFIED, CONFLICT-FREE MICROPROCESSOR.

INTEL SEEKS TO REDUCE OUR GLOBAL GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS BY INVESTING IN ENERGY CONSERVATION PROJECTS IN OUR FACTORIES AND WORKING WITH SUPPLIERS TO IMPROVE ENERGY EFFICIENCY. WE TAKE A HOLISTIC APPROACH TO POWER

MANAGEMENT, ADDRESSING THE CHALLENGE AT THE SILICON, PACKAGE, CIRCUIT, MICRO/MACRO ARCHITECTURE, PLATFORM, AND SOFTWARE LEVELS. WE RECOGNIZE THAT CLIMATE CHANGE MAY CAUSE GENERAL ECONOMIC RISK. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ON THE RISKS OF CLIMATE CHANGE,

SEE RISK FACTORS IN PART I, ITEM 1A OF THIS FORM 10-K. WE SEE THE POTENTIAL FOR HIGHER ENERGY COSTS DRIVEN BY CLIMATE CHANGE REGULATIONS. THIS COULD INCLUDE ITEMS APPLIED TO UTILITIES THAT ARE PASSED ALONG TO CUSTOMERS, SUCH AS

CARBON TAXES OR COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH OBTAINING PERMITS FOR OUR U.S. MANUFACTURING OPERATIONS, EMISSION CAP AND TRADE PROGRAMS, OR RENEWABLE PORTFOLIO STANDARDS.

WE ARE COMMITTED TO SUSTAINABILITY AND TAKE A LEADERSHIP POSITION IN PROMOTING VOLUNTARY ENVIRONMENTAL INITIATIVES AND WORKING PROACTIVELY WITH GOVERNMENTS, ENVIRONMENTAL GROUPS, AND INDUSTRY TO PROMOTE GLOBAL

ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY. WE BELIEVE THAT TECHNOLOGY WILL BE FUNDAMENTAL TO FINDING SOLUTIONS TO THE WORLDS ENVIRONMENTAL CHALLENGES, AND WE ARE JOINING FORCES WITH INDUSTRY, BUSINESS, AND GOVERNMENTS TO FIND AND PROMOTE WAYS THAT

TECHNOLOGY CAN BE USED AS A TOOL TO COMBAT CLIMATE CHANGE.

WE HAVE BEEN PURCHASING WIND POWER AND OTHER FORMS OF RENEWABLE ENERGY AT SOME OF OUR MAJOR SITES FOR SEVERAL YEARS.

WE PURCHASE RENEWABLE ENERGY CERTIFICATES UNDER A MULTI-YEAR CONTRACT. THE PURCHASE HAS PLACED INTEL AT THE TOP OF THE EPAS GREEN POWER PARTNERSHIP FOR THE PAST FOUR YEARS AND WAS INTENDED TO HELP STIMULATE THE MARKET FOR GREEN POWER, LEADING

TO ADDITIONAL GENERATING CAPACITY AND, ULTIMATELY, LOWER COSTS.

RISK FACTORS

CHANGES

IN PRODUCT DEMAND MAY HARM OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS AND ARE HARD TO PREDICT.

IF PRODUCT DEMAND DECREASES, OUR REVENUE AND PROFIT COULD BE HARMED.

IMPORTANT FACTORS THAT COULD CAUSE DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS TO DECREASE INCLUDE CHANGES IN.



BUSINESS CONDITIONS, INCLUDING DOWNTURNS IN THE COMPUTING INDUSTRY, REGIONAL ECONOMIES, AND THE OVERALL ECONOMY;



CONSUMER CONFIDENCE OR INCOME LEVELS CAUSED BY CHANGES IN MARKET CONDITIONS, INCLUDING CHANGES IN GOVERNMENT BORROWING, TAXATION, OR SPENDING POLICIES; THE

CREDIT MARKET; OR EXPECTED INFLATION, EMPLOYMENT, AND ENERGY OR OTHER COMMODITY PRICES;



THE LEVEL OF CUSTOMERS INVENTORIES;



COMPETITIVE AND PRICING PRESSURES, INCLUDING ACTIONS TAKEN BY COMPETITORS;



CUSTOMER PRODUCT NEEDS;



MARKET ACCEPTANCE OF OUR PRODUCTS AND MATURING PRODUCT CYCLES; AND



THE HIGH-TECHNOLOGY SUPPLY CHAIN, INCLUDING SUPPLY CONSTRAINTS CAUSED BY NATURAL DISASTERS OR OTHER EVENTS.

OUR OPERATIONS HAVE HIGH COSTS, SUCH AS THOSE RELATED TO FACILITY CONSTRUCTION AND EQUIPMENT, R&D, AND EMPLOYMENT AND TRAINING OF A HIGHLY SKILLED WORKFORCE,

THAT ARE EITHER FIXED OR DIFFICULT TO REDUCE IN THE SHORT TERM. AT THE SAME TIME, DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS IS HIGHLY VARIABLE. IF PRODUCT DEMAND DECREASES OR WE FAIL TO FORECAST DEMAND ACCURATELY, WE COULD BE REQUIRED TO WRITE OFF INVENTORY OR RECORD

EXCESS CAPACITY CHARGES, WHICH WOULD LOWER OUR GROSS MARGIN. OUR MANUFACTURING OR ASSEMBLY AND TEST CAPACITY COULD BE UNDERUTILIZED, AND WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO WRITE DOWN OUR LONG-LIVED ASSETS, WHICH WOULD INCREASE OUR EXPENSES. FACTORY-PLANNING

DECISIONS MAY SHORTEN THE USEFUL LIVES OF FACILITIES AND EQUIPMENT AND CAUSE US TO ACCELERATE DEPRECIATION. IF PRODUCT DEMAND INCREASES, WE MAY BE UNABLE TO ADD CAPACITY FAST ENOUGH TO MEET MARKET DEMAND. THESE CHANGES IN PRODUCT DEMAND, AND CHANGES

IN OUR CUSTOMERS PRODUCT NEEDS, COULD NEGATIVELY AFFECT OUR COMPETITIVE POSITION AND MAY REDUCE OUR REVENUE, INCREASE OUR COSTS, LOWER OUR GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE, OR REQUIRE US TO WRITE DOWN OUR ASSETS.

WE OPERATE IN HIGHLY COMPETITIVE INDUSTRIES, AND OUR FAILURE TO ANTICIPATE AND RESPOND TO TECHNOLOGICAL AND MARKET DEVELOPMENTS COULD HARM OUR

ABILITY TO COMPETE.

WE OPERATE IN HIGHLY COMPETITIVE INDUSTRIES THAT EXPERIENCE RAPID TECHNOLOGICAL AND MARKET DEVELOPMENTS, CHANGES IN INDUSTRY

STANDARDS, CHANGES IN CUSTOMER NEEDS, AND FREQUENT PRODUCT INTRODUCTIONS AND IMPROVEMENTS. IF WE ARE UNABLE TO ANTICIPATE AND RESPOND TO THESE DEVELOPMENTS, WE MAY WEAKEN OUR COMPETITIVE POSITION, AND OUR PRODUCTS OR TECHNOLOGIES MAY BE

UNCOMPETITIVE OR OBSOLETE. AS COMPUTING MARKET SEGMENTS EMERGE, SUCH AS NETBOOKS, SMARTPHONES, TABLETS, AND CONSUMER ELECTRONICS DEVICES, WE FACE NEW SOURCES OF COMPETITION AND CUSTOMERS WITH DIFFERENT NEEDS THAN CUSTOMERS IN OUR PC BUSINESS. TO BE

SUCCESSFUL, WE NEED TO CULTIVATE NEW INDUSTRY RELATIONSHIPS IN THESE MARKET SEGMENTS. AS THE NUMBER AND VARIETY OF

INTERNET-CONNECTED DEVICES INCREASE, WE NEED TO IMPROVE THE COST, CONNECTIVITY, ENERGY EFFICIENCY, AND SECURITY OF OUR PLATFORMS TO SUCCEED IN THESE NEW MARKET SEGMENTS. AND WE NEED TO EXPAND OUR

SOFTWARE CAPABILITIES IN ORDER TO PROVIDE CUSTOMERS WITH COMPLETE COMPUTING SOLUTIONS.

TO COMPETE SUCCESSFULLY, WE MUST MAINTAIN A SUCCESSFUL R&D

EFFORT, DEVELOP NEW PRODUCTS AND PRODUCTION PROCESSES, AND IMPROVE OUR EXISTING PRODUCTS AND PROCESSES AHEAD OF COMPETITORS. OUR R&D EFFORTS ARE CRITICAL TO OUR SUCCESS AND ARE AIMED AT SOLVING COMPLEX PROBLEMS, AND WE DO NOT EXPECT THAT ALL OF

OUR PROJECTS WILL BE SUCCESSFUL. WE MAY BE UNABLE TO DEVELOP AND MARKET NEW PRODUCTS SUCCESSFULLY, THE PRODUCTS WE INVEST IN AND DEVELOP MAY NOT BE WELL RECEIVED BY CUSTOMERS, AND PRODUCTS AND TECHNOLOGIES OFFERED BY OTHERS MAY AFFECT DEMAND FOR OUR

PRODUCTS. THESE TYPES OF EVENTS COULD NEGATIVELY AFFECT OUR COMPETITIVE POSITION AND MAY REDUCE REVENUE, INCREASE COSTS, LOWER GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE, OR REQUIRE US TO IMPAIR OUR ASSETS.

CHANGES IN THE MIX OF PRODUCTS SOLD MAY HARM OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS.

BECAUSE OF THE WIDE

PRICE DIFFERENCES IN NOTEBOOK, NETBOOK, SMARTPHONE, TABLET, DESKTOP, AND SERVER MICROPROCESSORS, THE MIX OF MICROPROCESSORS SOLD AFFECTS THE AVERAGE SELLING PRICES OF OUR PRODUCTS AND HAS A LARGE IMPACT ON OUR REVENUE AND GROSS MARGIN. OUR FINANCIAL

RESULTS ALSO DEPEND ON THE MIX OF OTHER PRODUCTS THAT WE SELL, SUCH AS CHIPSETS, FLASH MEMORY, AND OTHER SEMICONDUCTOR PRODUCTS. MORE RECENTLY INTRODUCED PRODUCTS TEND TO HAVE HIGHER COSTS BECAUSE OF INITIAL DEVELOPMENT AND PRODUCTION, AND CHANGES

IN THE MIX OF PRODUCTS SOLD MAY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO RECOVER OUR FIXED COSTS AND PRODUCT INVESTMENTS.

OUR GLOBAL OPERATIONS

SUBJECT US TO RISKS THAT MAY HARM OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

WE HAVE SALES OFFICES, R&D, MANUFACTURING, ASSEMBLY AND

TEST FACILITIES, AND OTHER FACILITIES IN MANY COUNTRIES, AND SOME BUSINESS ACTIVITIES MAY BE CONCENTRATED IN ONE OR MORE GEOGRAPHIC AREAS. AS A RESULT, OUR ABILITY TO MANUFACTURE, ASSEMBLE AND TEST, DESIGN, DEVELOP, OR SELL PRODUCTS MAY BE AFFECTED

BY.



SECURITY CONCERNS, SUCH AS ARMED CONFLICT AND CIVIL OR MILITARY UNREST, CRIME, POLITICAL INSTABILITY, AND TERRORIST ACTIVITY;



NATURAL DISASTERS AND HEALTH CONCERNS;



INEFFICIENT AND LIMITED INFRASTRUCTURE AND DISRUPTIONS, SUCH AS SUPPLY CHAIN INTERRUPTIONS AND LARGE-SCALE OUTAGES OR INTERRUPTIONS OF SERVICE FROM UTILITIES,

TRANSPORTATION, OR TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROVIDERS;



RESTRICTIONS ON OUR OPERATIONS BY GOVERNMENTS SEEKING TO SUPPORT LOCAL INDUSTRIES, NATIONALIZATION OF OUR OPERATIONS, AND RESTRICTIONS ON OUR ABILITY TO

REPATRIATE EARNINGS;



DIFFERING EMPLOYMENT PRACTICES AND LABOR ISSUES; AND



LOCAL BUSINESS AND CULTURAL FACTORS THAT DIFFER FROM OUR NORMAL STANDARDS AND PRACTICES, INCLUDING BUSINESS PRACTICES THAT WE ARE PROHIBITED FROM ENGAGING IN BY

THE FOREIGN CORRUPT PRACTICES ACT (FCPA) AND OTHER ANTI-CORRUPTION LAWS AND REGULATIONS.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

LEGAL AND REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS DIFFER AMONG JURISDICTIONS WORLDWIDE. VIOLATIONS OF THESE LAWS AND REGULATIONS

COULD RESULT IN FINES; CRIMINAL SANCTIONS AGAINST US, OUR OFFICERS, OR OUR EMPLOYEES; PROHIBITIONS ON THE CONDUCT OF OUR BUSINESS; AND DAMAGE TO OUR REPUTATION. ALTHOUGH WE HAVE POLICIES, CONTROLS, AND PROCEDURES DESIGNED TO ENSURE COMPLIANCE WITH

THESE LAWS, OUR EMPLOYEES, CONTRACTORS, OR AGENTS MAY VIOLATE OUR POLICIES.

ALTHOUGH MOST OF OUR SALES OCCUR IN U.S. DOLLARS, EXPENSES SUCH AS PAYROLL,

UTILITIES, TAX, AND MARKETING EXPENSES MAY BE PAID IN LOCAL CURRENCIES. WE ALSO CONDUCT CERTAIN INVESTING AND FINANCING ACTIVITIES IN LOCAL CURRENCIES. OUR HEDGING PROGRAMS REDUCE, BUT DO NOT ELIMINATE, THE IMPACT OF CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE

MOVEMENTS; THEREFORE, CHANGES IN EXCHANGE RATES COULD HARM OUR RESULTS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. CHANGES IN TARIFF AND IMPORT REGULATIONS AND IN U.S. AND NON-U.S. MONETARY POLICIES MAY HARM OUR RESULTS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION BY INCREASING OUR

EXPENSES AND REDUCING REVENUE. VARYING TAX RATES IN DIFFERENT JURISDICTIONS COULD HARM OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION BY INCREASING OUR OVERALL TAX RATE.

WE MAINTAIN A PROGRAM OF INSURANCE COVERAGE FOR A VARIETY OF PROPERTY, CASUALTY, AND OTHER RISKS. WE PLACE OUR INSURANCE COVERAGE WITH MULTIPLE CARRIERS IN NUMEROUS JURISDICTIONS. HOWEVER, ONE OR MORE OF OUR

INSURANCE PROVIDERS MAY BE UNABLE OR UNWILLING TO PAY A CLAIM. THE TYPES AND AMOUNTS OF INSURANCE WE OBTAIN VARY DEPENDING ON AVAILABILITY, COST, AND DECISIONS WITH RESPECT TO RISK RETENTION. THE POLICIES HAVE DEDUCTIBLES AND EXCLUSIONS THAT RESULT

IN US RETAINING A LEVEL OF SELF-INSURANCE. LOSSES NOT COVERED BY INSURANCE MAY BE LARGE, WHICH COULD HARM OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

FAILURE TO MEET OUR PRODUCTION TARGETS, RESULTING IN UNDERSUPPLY OR OVERSUPPLY OF PRODUCTS, MAY HARM OUR BUSINESS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

PRODUCTION OF INTEGRATED CIRCUITS IS A COMPLEX PROCESS. DISRUPTIONS IN THIS PROCESS CAN RESULT FROM ERRORS; DIFFICULTIES IN OUR DEVELOPMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION OF

NEW PROCESSES; DEFECTS IN MATERIALS; DISRUPTIONS IN OUR SUPPLY OF MATERIALS OR RESOURCES; AND DISRUPTIONS AT OUR FABRICATION AND ASSEMBLY AND TEST FACILITIES DUE TO ACCIDENTS, MAINTENANCE ISSUES, OR UNSAFE WORKING CONDITIONSALL OF WHICH COULD

AFFECT THE TIMING OF PRODUCTION RAMPS AND YIELDS. WE MAY NOT BE SUCCESSFUL OR EFFICIENT IN DEVELOPING OR IMPLEMENTING NEW PRODUCTION PROCESSES. PRODUCTION ISSUES MAY RESULT IN OUR FAILURE TO MEET OR INCREASE PRODUCTION AS DESIRED, RESULTING IN

HIGHER COSTS OR LARGE DECREASES IN YIELDS, WHICH COULD AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO PRODUCE SUFFICIENT VOLUME TO MEET PRODUCT DEMAND. THE UNAVAILABILITY OR REDUCED AVAILABILITY OF PRODUCTS COULD MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT TO DELIVER COMPUTING PLATFORMS. THE

OCCURRENCE OF THESE EVENTS COULD HARM OUR BUSINESS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

WE MAY HAVE DIFFICULTIES OBTAINING THE RESOURCES OR PRODUCTS WE NEED FOR MANUFACTURING,

ASSEMBLING AND TESTING OUR PRODUCTS, OR OPERATING OTHER ASPECTS OF OUR BUSINESS, WHICH COULD HARM OUR ABILITY TO MEET DEMAND AND INCREASE OUR COSTS.

WE HAVE THOUSANDS OF SUPPLIERS PROVIDING MATERIALS THAT WE USE IN PRODUCTION AND OTHER ASPECTS OF OUR BUSINESS, AND WE SEEK, WHERE POSSIBLE, TO HAVE SEVERAL SOURCES OF SUPPLY FOR ALL OF THOSE MATERIALS. HOWEVER, WE

MAY RELY ON A SINGLE OR A LIMITED NUMBER OF SUPPLIERS, OR UPON SUPPLIERS IN A SINGLE LOCATION, FOR THESE MATERIALS. THE INABILITY OF SUPPLIERS TO DELIVER ADEQUATE SUPPLIES OF PRODUCTION MATERIALS OR OTHER SUPPLIES COULD DISRUPT OUR PRODUCTION

PROCESSES OR MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR US TO IMPLEMENT OUR BUSINESS STRATEGY. PRODUCTION COULD BE DISRUPTED BY THE UNAVAILABILITY OF RESOURCES USED IN PRODUCTION, SUCH AS WATER, SILICON, ELECTRICITY, GASES, AND OTHER MATERIALS. FUTURE ENVIRONMENTAL

REGULATIONS COULD RESTRICT THE SUPPLY OR INCREASE THE COST OF MATERIALS THAT WE USE IN OUR BUSINESS AND MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT TO OBTAIN PERMITS TO BUILD OR MODIFY MANUFACTURING CAPACITY TO MEET DEMAND. THE UNAVAILABILITY OR REDUCED AVAILABILITY OF

MATERIALS OR RESOURCES MAY REQUIRE US TO REDUCE PRODUCTION OR INCUR ADDITIONAL COSTS. THE OCCURRENCE OF THESE EVENTS COULD HARM OUR BUSINESS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

COSTS RELATED TO PRODUCT DEFECTS AND ERRATA MAY HARM OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND BUSINESS.

COSTS OF PRODUCT DEFECTS AND ERRATA (DEVIATIONS FROM PUBLISHED SPECIFICATIONS) DUE TO, FOR EXAMPLE, PROBLEMS IN OUR DESIGN AND MANUFACTURING PROCESSES, COULD INCLUDE.



WRITING OFF THE VALUE OF INVENTORY;



DISPOSING OF PRODUCTS THAT CANNOT BE FIXED;



RECALLING PRODUCTS THAT HAVE BEEN SHIPPED;



PROVIDING PRODUCT REPLACEMENTS OR MODIFICATIONS; AND



DEFENDING AGAINST LITIGATION.

THESE COSTS

COULD BE LARGE AND MAY INCREASE EXPENSES AND LOWER GROSS MARGIN. OUR REPUTATION WITH CUSTOMERS OR END USERS COULD BE DAMAGED AS A RESULT OF PRODUCT DEFECTS AND ERRATA, AND PRODUCT DEMAND COULD BE REDUCED. THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF PRODUCT DEFECTS AND

ERRATA COULD CAUSE CUSTOMERS TO PURCHASE PRODUCTS FROM COMPETITORS AS A RESULT OF POSSIBLE SHORTAGES OF INTEL COMPONENTS OR FOR OTHER REASONS. THESE FACTORS COULD HARM OUR BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL RESULTS.

THIRD PARTIES MAY ATTEMPT TO BREACH OUR NETWORK SECURITY, WHICH COULD DAMAGE OUR REPUTATION AND

FINANCIAL RESULTS.

WE REGULARLY FACE ATTEMPTS BY OTHERS TO GAIN UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS THROUGH THE INTERNET OR INTRODUCE MALICIOUS SOFTWARE TO OUR

IT SYSTEMS. THESE ATTEMPTSWHICH MIGHT BE THE RESULT OF INDUSTRIAL OR OTHER ESPIONAGE, OR ACTIONS BY HACKERS SEEKING TO HARM THE COMPANY, ITS PRODUCTS, OR END USERSARE SOMETIMES SUCCESSFUL. IN PART BECAUSE OF THE HIGH PROFILE OF OUR

MCAFEE SUBSIDIARY IN THE NETWORK AND SYSTEM PROTECTION BUSINESS, WE MIGHT BECOME A TARGET OF COMPUTER HACKERS WHO CREATE VIRUSES TO SABOTAGE OR OTHERWISE ATTACK OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. HACKERS MIGHT ATTEMPT TO PENETRATE OUR NETWORK SECURITY AND

GAIN ACCESS TO OUR NETWORK AND OUR DATA CENTERS, STEAL PROPRIETARY INFORMATION, INCLUDING PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION, OR INTERRUPT OUR INTERNAL SYSTEMS AND SERVICES. WE SEEK TO DETECT AND INVESTIGATE THESE SECURITY INCIDENTS AND TO PREVENT

THEIR RECURRENCE, BUT IN SOME CASES WE MIGHT BE UNAWARE OF AN INCIDENT OR ITS MAGNITUDE AND EFFECTS.

THIRD PARTIES MAY CLAIM

INFRINGEMENT OF IP, WHICH COULD HARM OUR BUSINESS.

WE MAY FACE IP INFRINGEMENT CLAIMS FROM INDIVIDUALS AND COMPANIES, INCLUDING THOSE WHO HAVE

ACQUIRED PATENT PORTFOLIOS TO ASSERT CLAIMS AGAINST OTHER COMPANIES. WE ARE ENGAGED IN A NUMBER OF LITIGATION MATTERS INVOLVING IP. CLAIMS THAT OUR PRODUCTS OR PROCESSES INFRINGE THE IP OF OTHERS COULD CAUSE US TO INCUR LARGE COSTS TO RESPOND TO,

DEFEND, AND RESOLVE THE CLAIMS, AND MAY DIVERT THE EFFORTS AND ATTENTION OF MANAGEMENT AND TECHNICAL PERSONNEL. AS A RESULT OF IP INFRINGEMENT CLAIMS, WE COULD.



PAY INFRINGEMENT CLAIMS;



STOP MANUFACTURING, USING, OR SELLING PRODUCTS OR TECHNOLOGY SUBJECT TO INFRINGEMENT CLAIMS;



DEVELOP OTHER PRODUCTS OR TECHNOLOGY NOT SUBJECT TO INFRINGEMENT CLAIMS, WHICH COULD BE TIME-CONSUMING AND COSTLY OR MAY NOT BE POSSIBLE; OR



LICENSE TECHNOLOGY FROM THE PARTY CLAIMING INFRINGEMENT, WHICH LICENSE MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE ON COMMERCIALLY REASONABLE TERMS.

THESE ACTIONS COULD HARM OUR COMPETITIVE POSITION, RESULT IN EXPENSES, OR REQUIRE US TO IMPAIR OUR ASSETS. IF WE ALTER OR STOP PRODUCTION OF AFFECTED ITEMS, OUR

REVENUE COULD BE HARMED.

WE MAY BE UNABLE TO ENFORCE OR PROTECT OUR IP, WHICH MAY HARM OUR ABILITY TO COMPETE AND HARM OUR

BUSINESS.

OUR ABILITY TO ENFORCE OUR PATENTS, COPYRIGHTS, SOFTWARE LICENSES, AND OTHER IP IS SUBJECT TO GENERAL LITIGATION RISKS, AS WELL AS

UNCERTAINTY AS TO THE ENFORCEABILITY OF OUR IP IN VARIOUS COUNTRIES. WHEN WE SEEK TO ENFORCE OUR RIGHTS, WE ARE OFTEN SUBJECT TO CLAIMS THAT THE IP IS INVALID, NOT ENFORCEABLE, OR LICENSED TO THE OPPOSING PARTY. OUR ASSERTION OF IP OFTEN RESULTS IN

THE OTHER PARTY SEEKING TO ASSERT CLAIMS AGAINST US,

WHICH COULD HARM OUR BUSINESS. GOVERNMENTS MAY ADOPT REGULATIONSAND GOVERNMENTS OR COURTS MAY RENDER DECISIONSREQUIRING COMPULSORY LICENSING OF IP, OR GOVERNMENTS MAY REQUIRE PRODUCTS

TO MEET STANDARDS THAT SERVE TO FAVOR LOCAL COMPANIES. OUR INABILITY TO ENFORCE OUR IP UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES MAY HARM OUR COMPETITIVE POSITION AND BUSINESS.

WE MAY BE SUBJECT TO IP THEFT OR MISUSE, WHICH COULD RESULT IN CLAIMS AND HARM OUR BUSINESS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

THE THEFT OR UNAUTHORIZED USE OR PUBLICATION OF OUR TRADE SECRETS AND OTHER CONFIDENTIAL BUSINESS INFORMATION COULD HARM OUR COMPETITIVE POSITION AND REDUCE ACCEPTANCE OF OUR PRODUCTS; THE VALUE OF OUR INVESTMENT

IN R&D, PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT, AND MARKETING COULD BE REDUCED; AND THIRD PARTIES MIGHT MAKE CLAIMS RELATED TO LOSSES OF CONFIDENTIAL OR PROPRIETARY INFORMATION OR END-USER DATA, OR SYSTEM RELIABILITY. THESE INCIDENTS AND CLAIMS COULD SEVERELY

DISRUPT OUR BUSINESS, AND WE COULD SUFFER LOSSES, INCLUDING THE COST OF PRODUCT RECALLS AND RETURNS AND REPUTATIONAL HARM.

OUR

LICENSES WITH OTHER COMPANIES AND PARTICIPATION IN INDUSTRY INITIATIVES MAY ALLOW COMPETITORS TO USE OUR PATENT RIGHTS.

COMPANIES IN THE

COMPUTING INDUSTRY OFTEN BILATERALLY LICENSE PATENTS BETWEEN EACH OTHER TO SETTLE DISPUTES OR AS PART OF BUSINESS AGREEMENTS BETWEEN THEM. OUR COMPETITORS MAY HAVE LICENSES TO OUR PATENTS, AND UNDER CURRENT CASE LAW, SOME OF THE LICENSES MAY PERMIT

THESE COMPETITORS TO PASS OUR PATENT RIGHTS ON TO OTHERS UNDER SOME CIRCUMSTANCES. OUR PARTICIPATION IN INDUSTRY STANDARDS ORGANIZATIONS OR WITH OTHER INDUSTRY INITIATIVES MAY REQUIRE US TO LICENSE OUR PATENTS TO COMPANIES THAT ADOPT

INDUSTRY-STANDARD SPECIFICATIONS. DEPENDING ON THE RULES OF THE ORGANIZATION, WE MIGHT HAVE TO GRANT THESE LICENSES TO OUR PATENTS FOR LITTLE OR NO COST, AND AS A RESULT, WE MAY BE UNABLE TO ENFORCE CERTAIN PATENTS AGAINST OTHERS, OUR COSTS OF

ENFORCING OUR LICENSES OR PROTECTING OUR PATENTS MAY INCREASE, AND THE VALUE OF OUR IP MAY BE IMPAIRED.

LITIGATION OR REGULATORY

PROCEEDINGS COULD HARM OUR BUSINESS.

WE MAY FACE LEGAL CLAIMS OR REGULATORY MATTERS INVOLVING STOCKHOLDER, CONSUMER, COMPETITION, AND OTHER

ISSUES ON A GLOBAL BASIS. AS DESCRIBED IN NOTE 29: CONTINGENCIES IN PART II, ITEM 8 OF THIS FORM 10-K, WE ARE ENGAGED IN A NUMBER OF LITIGATION AND REGULATORY MATTERS. LITIGATION AND REGULATORY PROCEEDINGS ARE INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN,

AND ADVERSE RULINGS COULD OCCUR, INCLUDING MONETARY DAMAGES, OR AN INJUNCTION STOPPING US FROM MANUFACTURING OR SELLING PRODUCTS, ENGAGING IN BUSINESS PRACTICES, OR REQUIRING OTHER REMEDIES, SUCH AS COMPULSORY LICENSING OF PATENTS.

WE FACE RISKS RELATED TO SALES THROUGH DISTRIBUTORS AND OTHER THIRD PARTIES.

WE SELL A PORTION OF OUR PRODUCTS THROUGH THIRD PARTIES SUCH AS DISTRIBUTORS, VALUE-ADDED RESELLERS, OEMS, INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDERS, AND

CHANNEL PARTNERS (COLLECTIVELY REFERRED TO AS DISTRIBUTORS). USING THIRD PARTIES FOR DISTRIBUTION EXPOSES US TO MANY RISKS, INCLUDING COMPETITIVE PRESSURE, CONCENTRATION, CREDIT RISK, AND COMPLIANCE RISKS. DISTRIBUTORS MAY SELL PRODUCTS THAT COMPETE

WITH OUR PRODUCTS, AND WE MAY NEED TO PROVIDE FINANCIAL AND OTHER INCENTIVES TO FOCUS DISTRIBUTORS ON THE SALE OF OUR PRODUCTS. WE MAY RELY ON ONE OR MORE KEY DISTRIBUTORS FOR A PRODUCT, AND THE LOSS OF THESE DISTRIBUTORS COULD REDUCE OUR REVENUE.

DISTRIBUTORS MAY FACE FINANCIAL DIFFICULTIES, INCLUDING BANKRUPTCY, WHICH COULD HARM OUR COLLECTION OF ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND FINANCIAL RESULTS. VIOLATIONS OF FCPA OR SIMILAR LAWS BY DISTRIBUTORS OR OTHER THIRD-PARTY INTERMEDIARIES COULD HAVE A

MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR BUSINESS. FAILING TO MANAGE RISKS RELATED TO OUR USE OF DISTRIBUTORS MAY REDUCE SALES, INCREASE EXPENSES, AND WEAKEN OUR COMPETITIVE POSITION.

WE FACE RISKS RELATED TO SALES TO GOVERNMENT ENTITIES.

WE DERIVE A PORTION OF OUR

REVENUE FROM SALES TO GOVERNMENT ENTITIES AND THEIR RESPECTIVE AGENCIES. GOVERNMENT DEMAND AND PAYMENT FOR OUR PRODUCTS MAY BE AFFECTED BY PUBLIC SECTOR BUDGETARY CYCLES AND FUNDING AUTHORIZATIONS. GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS ARE SUBJECT TO OVERSIGHT,

INCLUDING SPECIAL RULES ON ACCOUNTING, EXPENSES, REVIEWS, AND SECURITY. FAILING TO COMPLY WITH THESE RULES COULD RESULT IN CIVIL AND CRIMINAL PENALTIES AND SANCTIONS, INCLUDING TERMINATION OF CONTRACTS, FINES AND SUSPENSIONS, OR DEBARMENT FROM

FUTURE GOVERNMENT BUSINESS.

WE INVEST IN COMPANIES FOR STRATEGIC REASONS AND MAY NOT REALIZE A RETURN ON OUR INVESTMENTS.

WE MAKE INVESTMENTS IN COMPANIES AROUND THE WORLD TO FURTHER STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES AND SUPPORT KEY BUSINESS INITIATIVES. THESE INVESTMENTS

INCLUDE EQUITY OR DEBT INSTRUMENTS OF PUBLIC OR PRIVATE COMPANIES, AND MANY OF THESE INSTRUMENTS ARE NON-MARKETABLE AT THE TIME OF OUR INITIAL INVESTMENT. COMPANIES RANGE FROM EARLY-STAGE COMPANIES THAT ARE STILL DEFINING THEIR STRATEGIC DIRECTION

TO MORE MATURE COMPANIES WITH ESTABLISHED REVENUE STREAMS AND BUSINESS MODELS. THE COMPANIES IN WHICH WE INVEST MAY FAIL BECAUSE THEY MAY BE UNABLE TO SECURE ADDITIONAL FUNDING, OBTAIN FAVORABLE TERMS FOR FUTURE FINANCINGS, OR PARTICIPATE IN

LIQUIDITY EVENTS SUCH AS PUBLIC OFFERINGS, MERGERS, AND PRIVATE SALES. IF ANY OF THESE PRIVATE COMPANIES FAIL, WE COULD LOSE ALL OR PART OF OUR INVESTMENT. IF WE DETERMINE THAT AN OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY DECLINE IN THE FAIR VALUE EXISTS FOR AN

INVESTMENT, WE WRITE DOWN THE INVESTMENT TO ITS FAIR VALUE AND RECOGNIZE A LOSS. WE HAVE LARGE INVESTMENTS IN THE FLASH MEMORY MARKET SEGMENT, AND DECLINES IN THIS MARKET SEGMENT OR CHANGES IN MANAGEMENTS PLANS WITH RESPECT TO OUR INVESTMENTS

IN THIS MARKET SEGMENT COULD RESULT IN LARGE IMPAIRMENT CHARGES, IMPACTING GAINS (LOSSES) ON EQUITY INVESTMENTS, NET.

WHEN THE STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES OF AN INVESTMENT HAVE BEEN ACHIEVED, OR IF THE INVESTMENT OR BUSINESS DIVERGES FROM OUR

STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES, WE MAY DECIDE TO DISPOSE OF THE INVESTMENT. WE MAY INCUR LOSSES ON THE DISPOSAL OF NON-MARKETABLE INVESTMENTS. FOR CASES IN WHICH WE ARE REQUIRED UNDER EQUITY METHOD ACCOUNTING TO RECOGNIZE A PROPORTIONATE SHARE OF ANOTHER

COMPANYS INCOME OR LOSS, SUCH INCOME OR LOSS MAY IMPACT EARNINGS. GAINS OR LOSSES FROM EQUITY SECURITIES COULD VARY FROM EXPECTATIONS, DEPENDING ON GAINS OR LOSSES REALIZED ON THE SALE OR EXCHANGE OF SECURITIES, GAINS OR LOSSES FROM EQUITY

INVESTMENTS, AND IMPAIRMENT CHARGES FOR EQUITY AND OTHER INVESTMENTS.

OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COULD VARY AS A RESULT OF THE

METHODS, ESTIMATES, AND JUDGMENTS THAT WE USE IN APPLYING ACCOUNTING POLICIES.

THE METHODS, ESTIMATES, AND JUDGMENTS THAT WE USE IN APPLYING

ACCOUNTING POLICIES HAVE A LARGE IMPACT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION, SEE CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES IN PART II, ITEM 7 OF THIS FORM 10-K. THESE METHODS, ESTIMATES, AND JUDGMENTS ARE SUBJECT TO LARGE

RISKS, UNCERTAINTIES, AND ASSUMPTIONS, AND CHANGES COULD AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

CHANGES IN OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE MAY

HARM OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

A NUMBER OF FACTORS MAY INCREASE OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATES, WHICH COULD REDUCE OUR NET INCOME, INCLUDING.



THE JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH PROFITS ARE DETERMINED TO BE EARNED AND TAXED;



THE RESOLUTION OF ISSUES ARISING FROM TAX AUDITS;



CHANGES IN THE VALUATION OF OUR DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, AND IN DEFERRED TAX VALUATION ALLOWANCES;



ADJUSTMENTS TO INCOME TAXES UPON FINALIZATION OF TAX RETURNS;



INCREASES IN EXPENSES NOT DEDUCTIBLE FOR TAX PURPOSES, INCLUDING WRITE-OFFS OF ACQUIRED IN-PROCESS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT AND IMPAIRMENTS OF GOODWILL;



CHANGES IN AVAILABLE TAX CREDITS;



CHANGES IN TAX LAWS OR THEIR INTERPRETATION, INCLUDING CHANGES IN THE U.S. TO THE TAXATION OF FOREIGN INCOME AND EXPENSES;



CHANGES IN U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES; AND



OUR DECISION TO REPATRIATE NON-U.S. EARNINGS FOR WHICH WE HAVE NOT PREVIOUSLY PROVIDED FOR U.S. TAXES.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

DECISIONS ABOUT THE SCOPE OF OPERATIONS OF OUR BUSINESS COULD AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

CHANGES IN THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT COULD LEAD TO CHANGES IN THE SCOPE OF OUR OPERATIONS, RESULTING IN RESTRUCTURING

AND ASSET IMPAIRMENT CHARGES. FACTORS THAT COULD AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION DUE TO A CHANGE IN THE SCOPE OF OUR OPERATIONS INCLUDE.



TIMING AND EXECUTION OF PLANS AND PROGRAMS SUBJECT TO LOCAL LABOR LAW REQUIREMENTS, INCLUDING CONSULTATION WITH WORK COUNCILS;



CHANGES IN ASSUMPTIONS RELATED TO SEVERANCE AND POSTRETIREMENT COSTS;



DIVESTITURES;



NEW BUSINESS INITIATIVES AND CHANGES IN PRODUCT ROADMAP, DEVELOPMENT, AND MANUFACTURING;



CHANGES IN EMPLOYMENT LEVELS AND TURNOVER RATES;



CHANGES IN PRODUCT DEMAND AND THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT; AND



CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS.

OUR ACQUISITIONS, DIVESTITURES, AND OTHER TRANSACTIONS COULD DISRUPT OUR ONGOING BUSINESS AND HARM OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

IN PURSUING OUR BUSINESS STRATEGY, WE ROUTINELY CONDUCT DISCUSSIONS, EVALUATE OPPORTUNITIES, AND ENTER INTO AGREEMENTS FOR POSSIBLE INVESTMENTS, ACQUISITIONS, DIVESTITURES, AND OTHER TRANSACTIONS, SUCH AS JOINT

VENTURES. ACQUISITIONS AND OTHER TRANSACTIONS INVOLVE LARGE CHALLENGES AND RISKS, INCLUDING RISKS THAT.



WE MAY BE UNABLE TO IDENTIFY OPPORTUNITIES ON TERMS ACCEPTABLE TO US;



THE TRANSACTION MAY NOT ADVANCE OUR BUSINESS STRATEGY;



WE MAY NOT REALIZE A SATISFACTORY RETURN;



WE MAY BE UNABLE TO RETAIN KEY PERSONNEL;



WE MAY EXPERIENCE DIFFICULTY IN INTEGRATING NEW EMPLOYEES, BUSINESS SYSTEMS, AND TECHNOLOGY;



ACQUIRED BUSINESSES MAY NOT HAVE ADEQUATE CONTROLS, PROCESSES, AND PROCEDURES TO ENSURE COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS AND REGULATIONS, AND OUR DUE DILIGENCE PROCESS MAY

NOT IDENTIFY COMPLIANCE ISSUES OR OTHER LIABILITIES;



WE MAY HAVE DIFFICULTY ENTERING NEW MARKET SEGMENTS; OR



WE MAY BE UNABLE TO RETAIN THE CUSTOMERS AND PARTNERS OF ACQUIRED BUSINESSES.

WHEN WE DECIDE TO SELL ASSETS OR A BUSINESS, WE MAY HAVE DIFFICULTY SELLING ON ACCEPTABLE TERMS IN A TIMELY MANNER,

AND THE AGREED TERMS AND FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS COULD BE RENEGOTIATED DUE TO CHANGES IN BUSINESS OR MARKET CONDITIONS. THESE CIRCUMSTANCES COULD DELAY THE ACHIEVEMENT OF OUR STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES OR CAUSE US TO INCUR ADDED EXPENSE, OR WE MAY SELL A

BUSINESS AT A PRICE OR ON TERMS THAT ARE LESS FAVORABLE THAN WE HAD ANTICIPATED, RESULTING IN A LOSS ON THE TRANSACTION.

IF WE DO ENTER INTO AGREEMENTS

WITH RESPECT TO ACQUISITIONS, DIVESTITURES, OR OTHER TRANSACTIONS, WE MAY FAIL TO COMPLETE THEM DUE TO FACTORS SUCH AS.



FAILURE TO OBTAIN REGULATORY OR OTHER APPROVALS;



IP DISPUTES OR OTHER LITIGATION; OR



DIFFICULTIES OBTAINING FINANCING FOR THE TRANSACTION.

OUR FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS COULD HARM OUR BUSINESS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

THE MANUFACTURING AND ASSEMBLING AND TESTING OF OUR PRODUCTS REQUIRE THE USE OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS THAT ARE SUBJECT TO A BROAD ARRAY OF EHS LAWS AND REGULATIONS. OUR FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH THESE LAWS OR

REGULATIONS COULD RESULT IN.



REGULATORY PENALTIES, FINES, AND LEGAL LIABILITIES;



SUSPENSION OF PRODUCTION;



ALTERATION OF OUR FABRICATION AND ASSEMBLY AND TEST PROCESSES; AND



RESTRICTIONS ON OUR OPERATIONS OR SALES.

OUR

FAILURE TO MANAGE THE USE, TRANSPORTATION, EMISSIONS, DISCHARGE, STORAGE, RECYCLING, OR DISPOSAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS COULD LEAD TO INCREASED COSTS OR FUTURE LIABILITIES. ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS COULD ALSO REQUIRE US TO ACQUIRE

POLLUTION ABATEMENT OR REMEDIATION EQUIPMENT, MODIFY PRODUCT DESIGNS, OR INCUR OTHER EXPENSES. MANY NEW MATERIALS THAT WE ARE EVALUATING FOR USE IN OUR OPERATIONS MAY BE SUBJECT TO REGULATION UNDER ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS. THESE

RESTRICTIONS COULD HARM OUR BUSINESS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS BY INCREASING OUR EXPENSES OR REQUIRING US TO ALTER MANUFACTURING AND ASSEMBLY AND TEST PROCESSES.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

CLIMATE CHANGE POSES BOTH REGULATORY AND PHYSICAL RISKS THAT COULD HARM OUR RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS AND AFFECT THE WAY WE CONDUCT BUSINESS.

IN ADDITION TO THE POSSIBLE DIRECT ECONOMIC IMPACT THAT CLIMATE CHANGE COULD HAVE ON US,

CLIMATE CHANGE MITIGATION PROGRAMS AND REGULATIONS CAN INCREASE OUR COSTS. THE COST OF PERFLUOROCOMPOUNDS (PFCS)A GAS THAT WE USE IN MANUFACTURINGCOULD INCREASE UNDER SOME CLIMATE-CHANGE-FOCUSED EMISSIONS TRADING PROGRAMS THAT MAY BE

IMPOSED BY REGULATION. IF THE USE OF PFCS IS PROHIBITED, WE WOULD NEED TO OBTAIN SUBSTITUTE MATERIALS THAT MAY COST MORE OR BE LESS AVAILABLE FOR OUR MANUFACTURING OPERATIONS. AIR-QUALITY PERMIT REQUIREMENTS FOR OUR MANUFACTURING OPERATIONS COULD

BECOME MORE BURDENSOME AND CAUSE DELAYS IN OUR ABILITY TO MODIFY OR BUILD ADDITIONAL MANUFACTURING CAPACITY. UNDER RECENTLY ADOPTED GREENHOUSE GAS REGULATIONS IN THE U.S., MANY OF OUR MANUFACTURING FACILITIES HAVE BECOME MAJOR SOURCES

UNDER THE CLEAN AIR ACT. AT A MINIMUM, THIS CHANGE IN STATUS RESULTS IN SOME UNCERTAINTY AS THE EPA ADOPTS GUIDANCE ON ITS GREENHOUSE GAS REGULATIONS. DUE TO THE DYNAMIC NATURE OF OUR OPERATIONS, IT IS LIKELY THAT THESE REGULATIONS WILL RESULT IN

INCREASED COSTS FOR OUR U.S. OPERATIONS. THESE COST INCREASES COULD BE ASSOCIATED WITH NEW AIR POLLUTION CONTROL REQUIREMENTS, AND INCREASED OR NEW MONITORING, RECORDKEEPING, AND REPORTING OF GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS.

WE ALSO SEE THE POTENTIAL FOR HIGHER ENERGY COSTS DRIVEN BY CLIMATE CHANGE REGULATIONS. OUR COSTS COULD INCREASE IF UTILITY COMPANIES PASS ON THEIR COSTS, SUCH AS THOSE ASSOCIATED WITH CARBON

TAXES, EMISSION CAP AND TRADE PROGRAMS, OR RENEWABLE PORTFOLIO STANDARDS. WHILE WE MAINTAIN BUSINESS RECOVERY PLANS THAT ARE INTENDED TO ALLOW US TO RECOVER FROM NATURAL DISASTERS OR OTHER EVENTS THAT CAN BE DISRUPTIVE TO OUR BUSINESS, WE CANNOT BE

SURE THAT OUR PLANS WILL FULLY PROTECT US FROM ALL SUCH DISASTERS OR EVENTS. MANY OF OUR OPERATIONS ARE LOCATED IN SEMI-ARID REGIONS, SUCH AS ISRAEL AND THE SOUTHWESTERN U.S. SOME SCENARIOS PREDICT THAT THESE REGIONS MAY BECOME EVEN MORE VULNERABLE

TO PROLONGED DROUGHTS DUE TO CLIMATE CHANGE.

A NUMBER OF FACTORS COULD LOWER INTEREST AND OTHER, NET, HARMING OUR RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS.

FACTORS THAT COULD LOWER INTEREST AND OTHER, NET IN OUR INCOME STATEMENTS INCLUDE CHANGES IN FIXED-INCOME, EQUITY, AND CREDIT

MARKETS; FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES; INTEREST RATES; CREDIT STANDING OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT COUNTERPARTIES; OUR CASH AND INVESTMENT BALANCES; AND OUR INDEBTEDNESS.

2011 WAS OUR MOST PROFITABLE YEAR, WITH RECORD REVENUE, OPERATING INCOME, NET INCOME, AND EARNINGS PER SHARE. REVENUE

OF $54.0 BILLION WAS UP $10.4 BILLION, OR 24% FROM A YEAR AGO, AND WAS OUR SECOND YEAR IN A ROW WITH REVENUE GROWING OVER 20%. WE SAW GROWTH IN 2011 IN BOTH OUR CLIENT BUSINESS AND OUR DATA CENTER BUSINESS. OUR CLIENT BUSINESS IS BENEFITING AS

RISING INCOMES INCREASE THE AFFORDABILITY OF PCS IN EMERGING MARKETS. OUR DATA CENTER BUSINESS IS BENEFITING AS THE INCREASING NUMBER OF DEVICES THAT COMPUTE AND CONNECT TO THE INTERNET DRIVES THE BUILD-OUT OF THE CLOUD INFRASTRUCTURE. ADDITIONALLY,

WE COMPLETED THE ACQUISITIONS OF MCAFEE AND THE WLS BUSINESS OF INFINEON IN 2011, WHICH COMBINED CONTRIBUTED APPROXIMATELY $3.6 BILLION TO OUR REVENUE GROWTH. OUR 2011 GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE WAS DOWN 2.8 PERCENTAGE POINTS COMPARED TO

2010. THE DECLINE

WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY THE INCREASE IN START-UP COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH 22NM FACTORIES AS WELL AS THE IMPACT OF ACQUISITIONS. THESE DECLINES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY GROWTH IN OUR PLATFORM

BUSINESS.

OUR FOURTH QUARTER REVENUE OF $13.9 BILLION WAS DOWN $346 MILLION FROM THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2011. THE FLOODS IN THAILAND AND THE RESULTING

HARD DISK DRIVE SUPPLY SHORTAGE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED OUR FOURTH QUARTER REVENUE AS OUR CUSTOMERS REDUCED INVENTORIES ACROSS THE SUPPLY CHAIN. WE EXPECT THE SHORTAGE OF HARD DISK DRIVES TO CONTINUE TO IMPACT OUR BUSINESS IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2012.

COMPARED TO THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2011, OUR FOURTH QUARTER GROSS MARGIN WAS UP 1.1 PERCENTAGE POINTS AS A RESULT OF LOWER MANUFACTURING COSTS (PLATFORM UNIT COSTS AND OTHER COST OF SALES), PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER PLATFORM WRITE-OFFS.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

(CONTINUED)

OUR STRONG FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE DURING 2011 HAS ALLOWED US TO MAKE SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS IN OUR BUSINESS AS WELL

AS INCREASE THE RETURN OF CASH TO OUR STOCKHOLDERS THROUGH COMMON STOCK REPURCHASES AND DIVIDENDS. FOR 2011, WE GENERATED A RECORD $21.0 BILLION OF CASH FROM OPERATIONS AND ENDED THE QUARTER WITH AN INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO OF $14.8 BILLION,

CONSISTING OF CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS, SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS, AND MARKETABLE DEBT INSTRUMENTS INCLUDED IN TRADING ASSETS. DURING 2011, WE ISSUED $5.0 BILLION OF SENIOR UNSECURED NOTES, PRIMARILY TO REPURCHASE SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK;

REPURCHASED $14.1 BILLION OF COMMON STOCK THROUGH OUR COMMON STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM; PURCHASED $10.8 BILLION IN CAPITAL ASSETS; SPENT $8.7 BILLION ON ACQUISITIONS; AND RETURNED $4.1 BILLION TO STOCKHOLDERS THROUGH DIVIDENDS. IN JANUARY

2012, THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS DECLARED A CASH DIVIDEND OF $0.21 PER COMMON SHARE FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2012.

LOOKING AHEAD TO

2012, WE BELIEVE THAT THE EMERGING MARKET, THE DATA CENTER, AND ENTERPRISE TRENDS THAT DROVE OUR REVENUE IN 2011 WILL CONTINUE TO DRIVE OUR BUSINESS IN 2012. IN ADDITION, WE HAVE A STRONG PRODUCT AND TECHNOLOGY PIPELINE COMING TO MARKET WITH THE

RAMP OF ULTRABOOK SYSTEMS WITH THE LAUNCH OF OUR 22NM PROCESS TECHNOLOGY MICROPROCESSORS (CODE NAMED IVY BRIDGE), THE LAUNCH OF OUR NEW SERVER PLATFORM (CODE NAMED ROMLEY), SECURITY, AND INTEL PROCESSOR-POWERED SMARTPHONES

AND TABLETS. FOR 2012, WE ARE ALSO FORECASTING A GROSS MARGIN INCREASE OF 1.5 PERCENTAGE POINTS, TO 64%. WE EXPECT LOWER START-UP COSTS, NO IMPACT FROM THE INTEL

®

6 SERIES EXPRESS CHIPSET DESIGN ISSUE, AND HIGHER PLATFORM REVENUE. THESE INCREASES TO GROSS MARGIN ARE EXPECTED TO BE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER PLATFORM UNIT COSTS

AS WE RAMP IVY BRIDGE. WE ARE FORECASTING AN INCREASE IN OUR INVESTMENT IN R&D OF APPROXIMATELY $1.8 BILLION AS WE MAKE INCREMENTAL INVESTMENT IN TECHNOLOGIES FOR ULTRABOOK SYSTEMS, DATA CENTERS, SMARTPHONES, AND TABLETS. ADDITIONALLY, WE ARE

MAKING INVESTMENTS IN CORE CAPABILITIES SUCH AS SECURITY, SOCS, AND EXTENDING OUR PROCESS TECHNOLOGY LEADERSHIP. WE ARE FORECASTING AN INCREASE IN CAPITAL SPENDING TO $12.5 BILLION, WHICH IS $1.7 BILLION HIGHER THAN IN 2011, AS WE BUILD THE

WORLDS FIRST HIGH-VOLUME MANUFACTURING FACTORIES FOR 14NM PROCESS TECHNOLOGY. WE BELIEVE THAT THIS CONTINUED INVESTMENT WILL ALLOW OUR PROCESS TECHNOLOGY AND MANUFACTURING ADVANTAGE TO CONTINUE TO EXTEND IN 2012, ENABLING A LEADERSHIP PRODUCT

PORTFOLIO.

OUR BUSINESS OUTLOOK FOR 2012 INCLUDES OUR CURRENT EXPECTATIONS FOR REVENUE, GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE, SPENDING, AND CAPITAL EXPENDITURES. WE

WILL KEEP OUR MOST CURRENT BUSINESS OUTLOOK PUBLICLY AVAILABLE ON OUR INVESTOR RELATIONS WEB SITE AT

WWW.INTC.COM

. THIS BUSINESS OUTLOOK IS NOT INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE INTO THIS FORM 10-K. WE EXPECT THAT OUR CORPORATE REPRESENTATIVES WILL,

FROM TIME TO TIME, MEET PUBLICLY OR PRIVATELY WITH INVESTORS AND OTHERS, AND MAY REITERATE THE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS CONTAINED IN BUSINESS OUTLOOK OR IN THIS FORM 10-K. THE PUBLIC CAN

CONTINUE TO RELY ON THE BUSINESS OUTLOOK PUBLISHED ON THE WEB SITE AS REPRESENTING OUR CURRENT EXPECTATIONS ON MATTERS COVERED, UNLESS WE PUBLISH A NOTICE STATING OTHERWISE. THE STATEMENTS IN

BUSINESS OUTLOOK AND FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS IN THIS FORM 10-K ARE SUBJECT TO REVISION DURING THE COURSE OF THE YEAR IN OUR QUARTERLY EARNINGS RELEASES AND SEC FILINGS AND AT OTHER TIMES.

THE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS IN BUSINESS OUTLOOK WILL BE EFFECTIVE THROUGH THE CLOSE OF BUSINESS ON MARCH 16, 2012 UNLESS UPDATED EARLIER. FROM THE CLOSE OF

BUSINESS ON MARCH 16, 2012 UNTIL OUR QUARTERLY EARNINGS RELEASE IS PUBLISHED, PRESENTLY SCHEDULED FOR APRIL 17, 2012, WE WILL OBSERVE A QUIET PERIOD. DURING THE QUIET PERIOD, BUSINESS OUTLOOK AND OTHER FORWARD-LOOKING

STATEMENTS FIRST PUBLISHED IN OUR FORM 8-K FILED ON JANUARY 19, 2012, AND OTHER FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS DISCLOSED IN THE COMPANYS NEWS RELEASES AND FILINGS WITH THE SEC, AS REITERATED OR UPDATED AS APPLICABLE IN THIS FORM 10-K,

SHOULD BE CONSIDERED HISTORICAL, SPEAKING AS OF PRIOR TO THE QUIET PERIOD ONLY AND NOT SUBJECT TO UPDATE. DURING THE QUIET PERIOD, OUR REPRESENTATIVES WILL NOT COMMENT ON OUR BUSINESS OUTLOOK OR OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS OR EXPECTATIONS. THE EXACT

TIMING AND DURATION OF THE ROUTINE QUIET PERIOD, AND ANY OTHERS THAT WE UTILIZE FROM TIME TO TIME, MAY VARY AT OUR DISCRETION.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

THE METHODS,

ESTIMATES, AND JUDGMENTS THAT WE USE IN APPLYING OUR ACCOUNTING POLICIES HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE RESULTS THAT WE REPORT IN OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. SOME OF OUR ACCOUNTING POLICIES REQUIRE US TO MAKE DIFFICULT AND SUBJECTIVE

JUDGMENTS, OFTEN AS A RESULT OF THE NEED TO MAKE ESTIMATES REGARDING MATTERS THAT ARE INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN. OUR MOST CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES INCLUDE.



THE VALUATION OF NON-MARKETABLE EQUITY INVESTMENTS AND THE DETERMINATION OF OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENTS, WHICH IMPACT GAINS (LOSSES) ON EQUITY INVESTMENTS,

NET WHEN WE RECORD IMPAIRMENTS;



THE ASSESSMENT OF RECOVERABILITY OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS (PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT; GOODWILL; AND IDENTIFIED INTANGIBLES), WHICH IMPACTS GROSS MARGIN OR

OPERATING EXPENSES WHEN WE RECORD ASSET IMPAIRMENTS OR ACCELERATE THEIR DEPRECIATION OR AMORTIZATION;



THE RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT OF CURRENT AND DEFERRED INCOME TAXES (INCLUDING THE MEASUREMENT OF UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS), WHICH IMPACT OUR PROVISION FOR

TAXES;



THE VALUATION OF INVENTORY, WHICH IMPACTS GROSS MARGIN; AND



THE RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT OF LOSS CONTINGENCIES, WHICH IMPACT GROSS MARGIN OR OPERATING EXPENSES WHEN WE RECOGNIZE A LOSS CONTINGENCY, REVISE THE ESTIMATE

FOR A LOSS CONTINGENCY, OR RECORD AN ASSET IMPAIRMENT.

BELOW, WE DISCUSS THESE POLICIES FURTHER, AS WELL AS THE ESTIMATES AND

JUDGMENTS INVOLVED.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

(CONTINUED)

NON-MARKETABLE EQUITY INVESTMENTS

WE REGULARLY INVEST IN NON-MARKETABLE EQUITY INSTRUMENTS OF PRIVATE COMPANIES, WHICH RANGE FROM EARLY-STAGE COMPANIES THAT ARE OFTEN STILL DEFINING THEIR STRATEGIC

DIRECTION TO MORE MATURE COMPANIES WITH ESTABLISHED REVENUE STREAMS AND BUSINESS MODELS. THE CARRYING VALUE OF OUR NON-MARKETABLE EQUITY INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO, EXCLUDING EQUITY DERIVATIVES, TOTALED $2.8 BILLION AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2011 ($2.6

BILLION AS OF DECEMBER 25, 2010). APPROXIMATELY HALF OF THIS BALANCE AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2011 WAS CONCENTRATED IN COMPANIES IN THE FLASH MEMORY MARKET SEGMENT. OUR FLASH MEMORY MARKET SEGMENT INVESTMENTS INCLUDE OUR INVESTMENT IN IMFT AND

IMFS OF $1.3 BILLION ($1.5 BILLION AS OF DECEMBER 25, 2010). FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION, SEE NOTE 11: EQUITY METHOD AND COST METHOD INVESTMENTS IN PART II, ITEM 8 OF THIS FORM 10-K.

OUR NON-MARKETABLE EQUITY INVESTMENTS ARE RECORDED USING THE COST METHOD OR THE EQUITY METHOD OF ACCOUNTING, DEPENDING ON THE FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES OF EACH

INVESTMENT. OUR NON-MARKETABLE EQUITY INVESTMENTS ARE CLASSIFIED WITHIN OTHER LONG-TERM ASSETS ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS.

NON-MARKETABLE

EQUITY INVESTMENTS ARE INHERENTLY RISKY, AND THEIR SUCCESS IS DEPENDENT ON PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT, MARKET ACCEPTANCE, OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCY, THE ABILITY OF THE INVESTEE COMPANIES TO RAISE ADDITIONAL FUNDS IN FINANCIAL MARKETS THAT CAN BE VOLATILE, AND

OTHER KEY BUSINESS FACTORS. THE COMPANIES COULD FAIL OR NOT BE ABLE TO RAISE ADDITIONAL FUNDS WHEN NEEDED, OR THEY MAY RECEIVE LOWER VALUATIONS WITH LESS FAVORABLE INVESTMENT TERMS THAN PREVIOUS FINANCINGS. THESE EVENTS COULD CAUSE OUR INVESTMENTS

TO BECOME IMPAIRED. IN ADDITION, FINANCIAL MARKET VOLATILITY COULD NEGATIVELY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO REALIZE VALUE IN OUR INVESTMENTS THROUGH LIQUIDITY EVENTS SUCH AS INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERINGS, MERGERS, AND PRIVATE SALES. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT

OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO RISKS, SEE RISK FACTORS IN PART I, ITEM 1A OF THIS FORM 10-K.

WE DETERMINE THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR

NON-MARKETABLE EQUITY INVESTMENTS PORTFOLIO QUARTERLY FOR DISCLOSURE PURPOSES; HOWEVER, THE INVESTMENTS ARE RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE ONLY IF AN IMPAIRMENT CHARGE IS RECOGNIZED. WE DETERMINE THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR NON-MARKETABLE EQUITY INVESTMENTS USING

THE MARKET AND INCOME APPROACHES. THE MARKET APPROACH INCLUDES THE USE OF FINANCIAL METRICS AND RATIOS OF COMPARABLE PUBLIC COMPANIES, SUCH AS PROJECTED REVENUE, EARNINGS, AND COMPARABLE PERFORMANCE MULTIPLES. THE SELECTION OF

COMPARABLE COMPANIES REQUIRES MANAGEMENT JUDGMENT AND IS BASED ON A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING COMPARABLE COMPANIES SIZES, GROWTH RATES, INDUSTRIES, DEVELOPMENT STAGES, AND OTHER RELEVANT

FACTORS. THE INCOME APPROACH INCLUDES THE USE OF A DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW MODEL, WHICH MAY INCLUDE ONE OR MULTIPLE DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW SCENARIOS AND REQUIRES THE FOLLOWING SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES FOR THE INVESTEE: REVENUE; EXPENSES, CAPITAL SPENDING,

AND OTHER COSTS; AND DISCOUNT RATES BASED ON THE RISK PROFILE OF COMPARABLE COMPANIES. ESTIMATES OF REVENUE, EXPENSES, CAPITAL SPENDING, AND OTHER COSTS ARE DEVELOPED USING AVAILABLE MARKET, HISTORICAL, AND FORECAST DATA. THE VALUATION OF OUR

NON-MARKETABLE EQUITY INVESTMENTS ALSO TAKES INTO ACCOUNT VARIABLES SUCH AS CONDITIONS REFLECTED IN THE CAPITAL MARKETS, RECENT FINANCING ACTIVITIES BY THE INVESTEES, THE INVESTEES CAPITAL STRUCTURES, THE TERMS OF THE INVESTEES ISSUED

INTERESTS, AND THE LACK OF MARKETABILITY OF THE INVESTMENTS.

FOR NON-MARKETABLE EQUITY INVESTMENTS, THE MEASUREMENT OF FAIR VALUE REQUIRES SIGNIFICANT

JUDGMENT AND INCLUDES QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE ANALYSIS OF IDENTIFIED EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES THAT IMPACT THE FAIR VALUE OF THE INVESTMENT, SUCH AS.



THE INVESTEES REVENUE AND EARNINGS TRENDS RELATIVE TO PRE-DEFINED MILESTONES AND OVERALL BUSINESS PROSPECTS;



THE TECHNOLOGICAL FEASIBILITY OF THE INVESTEES PRODUCTS AND TECHNOLOGIES;



THE GENERAL MARKET CONDITIONS IN THE INVESTEES INDUSTRY OR GEOGRAPHIC AREA, INCLUDING ADVERSE REGULATORY OR ECONOMIC CHANGES;



FACTORS RELATED TO THE INVESTEES ABILITY TO REMAIN IN BUSINESS, SUCH AS THE INVESTEES LIQUIDITY, DEBT RATIOS, AND THE RATE AT WHICH THE INVESTEE IS

USING ITS CASH; AND



THE INVESTEES RECEIPT OF ADDITIONAL FUNDING AT A LOWER VALUATION.

IF THE FAIR VALUE OF AN INVESTMENT IS BELOW OUR CARRYING VALUE, WE DETERMINE IF THE INVESTMENT IS OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARILY IMPAIRED BASED ON OUR QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE ANALYSIS, WHICH INCLUDES ASSESSING THE

SEVERITY AND DURATION OF THE IMPAIRMENT AND THE LIKELIHOOD OF RECOVERY BEFORE DISPOSAL. IF THE INVESTMENT IS CONSIDERED TO BE OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARILY IMPAIRED, WE WRITE DOWN THE INVESTMENT TO ITS FAIR VALUE. IMPAIRMENTS OF NON-MARKETABLE EQUITY

INVESTMENTS WERE $63 MILLION IN 2011. OVER THE PAST 12 QUARTERS, INCLUDING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2011, IMPAIRMENTS OF NON-MARKETABLE EQUITY INVESTMENTS RANGED FROM $8 MILLION TO $79 MILLION PER QUARTER.

LONG-LIVED ASSETS

PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT

WE ASSESS PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT FOR IMPAIRMENT WHEN

EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THAT THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE ASSETS OR THE ASSET GROUPING MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE. FACTORS THAT WE CONSIDER IN DECIDING WHEN TO PERFORM AN IMPAIRMENT REVIEW INCLUDE SIGNIFICANT UNDER-PERFORMANCE OF A

BUSINESS OR PRODUCT LINE IN RELATION TO EXPECTATIONS, SIGNIFICANT NEGATIVE INDUSTRY OR ECONOMIC TRENDS, AND SIGNIFICANT CHANGES OR PLANNED CHANGES IN OUR USE OF THE ASSETS. WE MEASURE THE RECOVERABILITY OF ASSETS THAT WILL CONTINUE TO BE USED IN OUR

OPERATIONS BY COMPARING THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE ASSET GROUPING TO OUR ESTIMATE OF THE RELATED TOTAL FUTURE UNDISCOUNTED NET CASH FLOWS. IF AN ASSET GROUPINGS CARRYING VALUE IS NOT RECOVERABLE THROUGH THE RELATED UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS, THE

ASSET GROUPING IS CONSIDERED TO BE IMPAIRED. THE IMPAIRMENT IS MEASURED BY COMPARING THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE ASSET GROUPINGS CARRYING VALUE AND ITS FAIR VALUE. PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT IS CONSIDERED A NON-FINANCIAL ASSET AND IS

RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE ONLY IF AN IMPAIRMENT CHARGE IS RECOGNIZED.

IMPAIRMENTS ARE DETERMINED FOR GROUPS OF ASSETS RELATED TO THE LOWEST LEVEL OF

IDENTIFIABLE INDEPENDENT CASH FLOWS. DUE TO OUR ASSET USAGE MODEL AND THE INTERCHANGEABLE NATURE OF OUR SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING CAPACITY, WE MUST MAKE SUBJECTIVE JUDGMENTS IN DETERMINING THE INDEPENDENT CASH FLOWS THAT CAN BE RELATED TO SPECIFIC

ASSET GROUPINGS. IN ADDITION, AS WE MAKE MANUFACTURING PROCESS CONVERSIONS AND OTHER FACTORY PLANNING DECISIONS, WE MUST MAKE SUBJECTIVE JUDGMENTS REGARDING THE REMAINING USEFUL LIVES OF ASSETS, PRIMARILY PROCESS-SPECIFIC SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING

TOOLS AND BUILDING IMPROVEMENTS. WHEN WE DETERMINE THAT THE USEFUL LIVES OF ASSETS ARE SHORTER THAN WE HAD ORIGINALLY ESTIMATED, WE ACCELERATE THE RATE OF DEPRECIATION OVER THE ASSETS NEW, SHORTER USEFUL LIVES. OVER THE PAST 12 QUARTERS,

INCLUDING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2011, IMPAIRMENTS AND ACCELERATED DEPRECIATION OF PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT RANGED FROM $10 MILLION TO $75 MILLION PER QUARTER.

GOODWILL

GOODWILL IS RECORDED WHEN THE PURCHASE PRICE PAID FOR AN ACQUISITION EXCEEDS THE

ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF THE NET IDENTIFIED TANGIBLE AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS ACQUIRED. GOODWILL IS ALLOCATED TO OUR REPORTING UNITS BASED ON RELATIVE FAIR VALUE OF THE FUTURE BENEFIT OF THE PURCHASED OPERATIONS TO OUR EXISTING BUSINESS UNITS AS WELL AS

THE ACQUIRED BUSINESS UNIT. REPORTING UNITS MAY BE OPERATING SEGMENTS AS A WHOLE OR AN OPERATION ONE LEVEL BELOW AN OPERATING SEGMENT, REFERRED TO AS A COMPONENT. OUR REPORTING UNITS ARE CONSISTENT WITH THE OPERATING SEGMENTS IDENTIFIED IN

NOTE 30: OPERATING SEGMENT AND GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION IN PART II, ITEM 8 OF THIS FORM 10-K.

WE PERFORM AN ANNUAL IMPAIRMENT ASSESSMENT IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF EACH YEAR, OR MORE FREQUENTLY IF INDICATORS OF

POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT EXIST, TO DETERMINE WHETHER IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT THE FAIR VALUE OF A REPORTING UNIT IN WHICH GOODWILL RESIDES IS LESS THAN ITS CARRYING VALUE. FOR REPORTING UNITS IN WHICH THIS ASSESSMENT CONCLUDES THAT IT IS MORE

LIKELY THAN NOT THAT THE FAIR VALUE IS MORE THAN ITS CARRYING VALUE, GOODWILL IS NOT CONSIDERED IMPAIRED AND WE ARE NOT REQUIRED TO PERFORM THE TWO-STEP GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT TEST. QUALITATIVE FACTORS CONSIDERED IN THIS ASSESSMENT INCLUDE INDUSTRY AND

MARKET CONSIDERATIONS, OVERALL FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE, AND OTHER RELEVANT EVENTS AND FACTORS AFFECTING THE REPORTING UNIT.

FOR REPORTING UNITS IN WHICH

THE IMPAIRMENT ASSESSMENT CONCLUDES THAT IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT THE FAIR VALUE IS LESS THAN ITS CARRYING VALUE, WE PERFORM THE FIRST STEP OF THE GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT TEST, WHICH COMPARES THE FAIR VALUE OF THE REPORTING UNIT TO ITS CARRYING

VALUE. IF THE FAIR VALUE OF THE REPORTING UNIT EXCEEDS THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE NET ASSETS ASSIGNED TO THAT UNIT, GOODWILL IS NOT CONSIDERED IMPAIRED AND WE ARE NOT REQUIRED TO PERFORM FURTHER TESTING. IF THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE NET ASSETS

ASSIGNED TO THE REPORTING UNIT EXCEEDS THE FAIR VALUE OF THE REPORTING UNIT, THEN WE MUST PERFORM THE SECOND STEP OF THE GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT TEST IN ORDER TO DETERMINE THE IMPLIED FAIR VALUE OF THE REPORTING UNITS GOODWILL. IF, DURING THIS

SECOND STEP, WE DETERMINE THAT THE CARRYING VALUE OF A REPORTING UNITS GOODWILL EXCEEDS ITS IMPLIED FAIR VALUE, WE WOULD RECORD AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS EQUAL TO THE DIFFERENCE.

DETERMINING THE FAIR VALUE OF A REPORTING UNIT INVOLVES THE USE OF SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS. OUR GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT TEST USES A WEIGHTING OF BOTH THE INCOME AND MARKET METHODS TO ESTIMATE THE

REPORTING UNITS FAIR VALUE. THE INCOME METHOD IS BASED ON A DISCOUNTED FUTURE CASH FLOW APPROACH THAT USES THE FOLLOWING REPORTING UNIT ESTIMATES: REVENUE, BASED ON ASSUMED MARKET SEGMENT GROWTH RATES AND INTELS ASSUMED MARKET SEGMENT

SHARE; ESTIMATED COSTS; AND APPROPRIATE DISCOUNT RATES BASED ON THE REPORTING UNITS WEIGHTED AVERAGE COST OF CAPITAL AS DETERMINED BY CONSIDERING THE OBSERVABLE WEIGHTED AVERAGE COST OF CAPITAL OF COMPARABLE COMPANIES. OUR ESTIMATES OF MARKET

SEGMENT GROWTH, OUR MARKET SEGMENT SHARE, AND COSTS ARE BASED ON HISTORICAL DATA, VARIOUS INTERNAL ESTIMATES, AND A VARIETY OF EXTERNAL SOURCES, AND ARE DEVELOPED AS PART OF OUR ROUTINE LONG-RANGE PLANNING PROCESS. THE SAME ESTIMATES ARE ALSO USED

IN PLANNING FOR OUR LONG-TERM MANUFACTURING AND ASSEMBLY AND TEST CAPACITY NEEDS AS PART OF OUR CAPITAL BUDGETING PROCESS, AND FOR BOTH LONG-TERM AND SHORT-TERM BUSINESS PLANNING AND FORECASTING. WE TEST THE REASONABLENESS OF THE INPUTS AND OUTCOMES

OF OUR DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW ANALYSIS AGAINST AVAILABLE COMPARABLE MARKET DATA. THE MARKET METHOD IS BASED ON FINANCIAL MULTIPLES OF COMPARABLE COMPANIES AND APPLIES A CONTROL PREMIUM. THE REPORTING UNITS CARRYING VALUE REPRESENTS THE

ASSIGNMENT OF VARIOUS ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, EXCLUDING CERTAIN CORPORATE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, SUCH AS CASH, INVESTMENTS, AND DEBT.

26

TABLE OF CONTENTS

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

(CONTINUED)

DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF EACH OF THE PRIOR THREE FISCAL YEARS, WE COMPLETED OUR ANNUAL IMPAIRMENT ASSESSMENTS,

AND IMPAIRMENT TESTS WHEN NECESSARY, AND CONCLUDED THAT GOODWILL WAS NOT IMPAIRED IN ANY OF THESE YEARS.

IDENTIFIED INTANGIBLES

WE MAKE JUDGMENTS ABOUT THE RECOVERABILITY OF PURCHASED FINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS WHENEVER EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THAT AN

IMPAIRMENT MAY EXIST. RECOVERABILITY OF FINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS IS MEASURED BY COMPARING THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF THE ASSET TO THE FUTURE UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS THAT THE ASSET IS EXPECTED TO GENERATE. WE REVIEW INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE

ASSETS FOR IMPAIRMENT QUARTERLY AND WHENEVER EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THAT THE CARRYING VALUE MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE. RECOVERABILITY OF INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS IS MEASURED BY COMPARING THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF THE ASSET

TO THE FUTURE DISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS THAT THE ASSET IS EXPECTED TO GENERATE. IF IT IS DETERMINED THAT AN INDIVIDUAL ASSET IS IMPAIRED, THE AMOUNT OF ANY IMPAIRMENT IS MEASURED AS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE CARRYING VALUE AND THE FAIR VALUE OF THE

IMPAIRED ASSET.

THE ASSUMPTIONS AND ESTIMATES USED TO DETERMINE FUTURE VALUES AND REMAINING USEFUL LIVES OF OUR INTANGIBLE AND OTHER LONG-LIVED ASSETS

ARE COMPLEX AND SUBJECTIVE. THEY CAN BE AFFECTED BY VARIOUS FACTORS, INCLUDING EXTERNAL FACTORS SUCH AS INDUSTRY AND ECONOMIC TRENDS, AND INTERNAL FACTORS SUCH AS CHANGES IN OUR BUSINESS STRATEGY AND OUR FORECASTS FOR SPECIFIC PRODUCT LINES. BASED

ON OUR IMPAIRMENT REVIEWS OF OUR INTANGIBLE ASSETS, WE RECOGNIZED IMPAIRMENT CHARGES OF APPROXIMATELY $10 MILLION IN 2011 AND NO IMPAIRMENT CHARGES IN THE PRIOR TWO FISCAL YEARS.

INCOME TAXES

WE MUST MAKE ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS IN DETERMINING THE PROVISION FOR

TAXES FOR FINANCIAL STATEMENT PURPOSES. THESE ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS OCCUR IN THE CALCULATION OF TAX CREDITS, BENEFITS, AND DEDUCTIONS, AND IN THE CALCULATION OF CERTAIN TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES THAT ARISE FROM DIFFERENCES IN THE TIMING OF

RECOGNITION OF REVENUE AND EXPENSE FOR TAX AND FINANCIAL STATEMENT PURPOSES, AS WELL AS THE INTEREST AND PENALTIES RELATED TO UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS. SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN THESE ESTIMATES MAY RESULT IN AN INCREASE OR DECREASE TO OUR TAX PROVISION

IN A SUBSEQUENT PERIOD.

WE MUST ASSESS THE LIKELIHOOD THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO RECOVER OUR DEFERRED TAX ASSETS. IF RECOVERY IS NOT LIKELY, WE MUST

INCREASE OUR PROVISION FOR TAXES BY RECORDING A VALUATION ALLOWANCE AGAINST THE DEFERRED TAX ASSETS THAT WE ESTIMATE WILL NOT ULTIMATELY BE RECOVERABLE. WE BELIEVE THAT WE WILL ULTIMATELY RECOVER THE DEFERRED TAX ASSETS RECORDED ON OUR CONSOLIDATED

BALANCE SHEETS. HOWEVER, SHOULD THERE BE A CHANGE IN OUR ABILITY TO RECOVER OUR DEFERRED TAX ASSETS, OUR

TAX PROVISION WOULD INCREASE IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH WE DETERMINED THAT THE RECOVERY WAS NOT LIKELY. RECOVERY OF A PORTION OF OUR DEFERRED TAX ASSETS IS IMPACTED BY MANAGEMENTS PLANS WITH

RESPECT TO HOLDING OR DISPOSING OF CERTAIN INVESTMENTS; THEREFORE, CHANGES IN MANAGEMENTS PLANS WITH RESPECT TO HOLDING OR DISPOSING OF INVESTMENTS COULD AFFECT OUR FUTURE PROVISION FOR TAXES.

THE CALCULATION OF OUR TAX LIABILITIES INVOLVES DEALING WITH UNCERTAINTIES IN THE APPLICATION OF COMPLEX TAX REGULATIONS. WE RECOGNIZE LIABILITIES FOR UNCERTAIN

TAX POSITIONS BASED ON A TWO-STEP PROCESS. THE FIRST STEP IS TO EVALUATE THE TAX POSITION FOR RECOGNITION BY DETERMINING IF THE WEIGHT OF AVAILABLE EVIDENCE INDICATES THAT IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT THE POSITION WILL BE SUSTAINED ON AUDIT,

INCLUDING RESOLUTION OF RELATED APPEALS OR LITIGATION PROCESSES, IF ANY. IF WE DETERMINE THAT A TAX POSITION WILL MORE LIKELY THAN NOT BE SUSTAINED ON AUDIT, THE SECOND STEP REQUIRES US TO ESTIMATE AND MEASURE THE TAX BENEFIT AS THE LARGEST AMOUNT

THAT IS MORE THAN 50% LIKELY TO BE REALIZED UPON ULTIMATE SETTLEMENT. IT IS INHERENTLY DIFFICULT AND SUBJECTIVE TO ESTIMATE SUCH AMOUNTS, AS WE HAVE TO DETERMINE THE PROBABILITY OF VARIOUS POSSIBLE OUTCOMES. WE RE-EVALUATE THESE UNCERTAIN TAX

POSITIONS ON A QUARTERLY BASIS. THIS EVALUATION IS BASED ON FACTORS SUCH AS CHANGES IN FACTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES, CHANGES IN TAX LAW, NEW AUDIT ACTIVITY, AND EFFECTIVELY SETTLED ISSUES. DETERMINING WHETHER AN UNCERTAIN TAX POSITION IS EFFECTIVELY

SETTLED REQUIRES JUDGMENT. SUCH A CHANGE IN RECOGNITION OR MEASUREMENT WOULD RESULT IN THE RECOGNITION OF A TAX BENEFIT OR AN ADDITIONAL CHARGE TO THE TAX PROVISION.

INVENTORY

THE VALUATION OF INVENTORY REQUIRES US TO ESTIMATE OBSOLETE OR EXCESS

INVENTORY AS WELL AS INVENTORY THAT IS NOT OF SALEABLE QUALITY. THE DETERMINATION OF OBSOLETE OR EXCESS INVENTORY REQUIRES US TO ESTIMATE THE FUTURE DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS. THE ESTIMATE OF FUTURE DEMAND IS COMPARED TO WORK-IN-PROCESS AND FINISHED

GOODS INVENTORY LEVELS TO DETERMINE THE AMOUNT, IF ANY, OF OBSOLETE OR EXCESS INVENTORY. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2011, WE HAD TOTAL WORK-IN-PROCESS INVENTORY OF $1.7 BILLION AND TOTAL FINISHED GOODS INVENTORY OF $1.8 BILLION. THE DEMAND FORECAST IS

INCLUDED IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF OUR SHORT-TERM MANUFACTURING PLANS TO ENABLE CONSISTENCY BETWEEN INVENTORY VALUATION AND BUILD DECISIONS. PRODUCT-SPECIFIC FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES REVIEWED IN THE INVENTORY VALUATION PROCESS INCLUDE A REVIEW OF THE

CUSTOMER BASE, THE STAGE OF THE PRODUCT LIFE CYCLE OF OUR PRODUCTS, CONSUMER CONFIDENCE, AND CUSTOMER ACCEPTANCE OF OUR PRODUCTS, AS WELL AS AN ASSESSMENT OF THE SELLING PRICE IN RELATION TO THE PRODUCT COST. IF OUR DEMAND FORECAST FOR SPECIFIC

PRODUCTS IS GREATER THAN ACTUAL DEMAND AND WE FAIL TO REDUCE MANUFACTURING OUTPUT ACCORDINGLY, WE COULD BE REQUIRED TO WRITE OFF INVENTORY, WHICH WOULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR GROSS MARGIN.

27

TABLE OF CONTENTS

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

(CONTINUED)

IN ORDER TO DETERMINE WHAT COSTS CAN BE INCLUDED IN THE VALUATION OF INVENTORY, WE MUST DETERMINE NORMAL CAPACITY AT

OUR MANUFACTURING AND ASSEMBLY AND TEST FACILITIES, BASED ON HISTORICAL LOADINGS COMPARED TO TOTAL AVAILABLE CAPACITY. IF THE FACTORY LOADINGS ARE BELOW THE ESTABLISHED NORMAL CAPACITY LEVEL, A PORTION OF OUR MANUFACTURING OVERHEAD COSTS WOULD NOT

BE INCLUDED IN THE COST OF INVENTORY, AND THEREFORE WOULD BE RECOGNIZED AS COST OF SALES IN THAT PERIOD, WHICH WOULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR GROSS MARGIN. WE REFER TO THESE COSTS AS EXCESS CAPACITY CHARGES. OVER THE PAST 12 QUARTERS, EXCESS CAPACITY

CHARGES RANGED FROM ZERO TO $680 MILLION PER QUARTER.

LOSS CONTINGENCIES

WE ARE SUBJECT TO VARIOUS LEGAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDINGS AND ASSERTED AND POTENTIAL CLAIMS, ACCRUALS RELATED TO REPAIR OR REPLACEMENT OF PARTS IN CONNECTION

WITH PRODUCT ERRATA, AS WELL AS PRODUCT WARRANTIES AND POTENTIAL ASSET IMPAIRMENTS (LOSS CONTINGENCIES) THAT ARISE IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS. AN ESTIMATED LOSS FROM SUCH CONTINGENCIES IS RECOGNIZED AS A CHARGE TO INCOME IF IT IS

PROBABLE THAT A LIABILITY HAS BEEN INCURRED AND THE AMOUNT OF THE LOSS CAN BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED. DISCLOSURE OF A LOSS CONTINGENCY IS REQUIRED IF THERE IS AT LEAST A REASONABLE POSSIBILITY THAT A LOSS HAS BEEN INCURRED. THE OUTCOMES OF

LEGAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDINGS AND CLAIMS, AND THE ESTIMATION OF PRODUCT WARRANTIES AND ASSET IMPAIRMENTS, ARE SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT UNCERTAINTY. SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT IS REQUIRED IN

BOTH THE DETERMINATION OF PROBABILITY AND THE DETERMINATION AS TO WHETHER A LOSS IS REASONABLY ESTIMABLE. WITH RESPECT TO ESTIMATING THE LOSSES ASSOCIATED WITH REPAIRING AND REPLACING PARTS IN CONNECTION WITH PRODUCT ERRATA, WE MAKE JUDGMENTS WITH

RESPECT TO CUSTOMER RETURN RATES, COSTS TO REPAIR OR REPLACE PARTS, AND WHERE THE PRODUCT IS IN OUR CUSTOMERS MANUFACTURING PROCESS. AT LEAST QUARTERLY, WE REVIEW THE STATUS OF EACH SIGNIFICANT MATTER, AND WE MAY REVISE OUR ESTIMATES. THESE

REVISIONS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL POSITION.

GEOGRAPHIC BREAKDOWN OF REVENUE

OUR NET REVENUE FOR 2011, WHICH INCLUDED 53 WEEKS, INCREASED $10.4 BILLION, OR 24%, COMPARED TO 2010, WHICH INCLUDED

52 WEEKS. THE INCREASE WAS DUE TO SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER PLATFORM (MICROPROCESSOR AND CHIPSET) AVERAGE SELLING PRICES AND, TO A LESSER EXTENT, SLIGHTLY HIGHER PLATFORM UNIT SALES. REVENUE FROM INTEL MOBILE COMMUNICATIONS (FORMERLY THE WLS BUSINESS OF

INFINEON) AND MCAFEE CONTRIBUTED $3.6 BILLION TO 2011 REVENUE. REVENUE IN THE AMERICAS, EUROPE, ASIA-PACIFIC, AND JAPAN REGIONS INCREASED BY 31%, 24%, 23%, AND 13%, RESPECTIVELY, COMPARED TO 2010.

OUR OVERALL GROSS MARGIN DOLLARS FOR 2011 INCREASED $5.3 BILLION, OR 18%, COMPARED TO 2010. THE INCREASE WAS

PRIMARILY DUE TO SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER REVENUE FROM OUR EXISTING BUSINESS AS WELL AS OUR ACQUIRED BUSINESS. THE INCREASE WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY APPROXIMATELY $1.0 BILLION OF HIGHER START-UP COSTS COMPARED TO 2010. THE AMORTIZATION OF

ACQUISITION-RELATED INTANGIBLES RESULTED IN A $482 MILLION REDUCTION TO OUR OVERALL GROSS MARGIN DOLLARS IN 2011, COMPARED TO $65 MILLION IN 2010, PRIMARILY DUE TO THE ACQUISITIONS OF MCAFEE AND THE WLS BUSINESS OF INFINEON.

OUR OVERALL GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE DECREASED TO 62.5% IN 2011 FROM 65.3% IN 2010. THE DECREASE IN GROSS MARGIN

PERCENTAGE WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE DECREASE IN THE PC CLIENT GROUP AND, TO A LESSER EXTENT, THE GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE DECREASE IN THE OTHER INTEL ARCHITECTURE OPERATING SEGMENTS. WE DERIVED A SUBSTANTIAL MAJORITY

OF OUR OVERALL GROSS MARGIN DOLLARS IN 2011, AND MOST OF OUR OVERALL GROSS MARGIN DOLLARS IN 2010, FROM THE SALE OF PLATFORMS IN THE PC CLIENT GROUP AND DATA CENTER GROUP OPERATING SEGMENTS.

OUR NET REVENUE FOR 2010 INCREASED $8.5 BILLION, OR 24%, COMPARED TO 2009. THE INCREASE WAS DUE TO SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER PLATFORM UNIT SALES AND, TO A LESSER EXTENT, HIGHER PLATFORM AVERAGE SELLING PRICES. REVENUE

IN THE JAPAN, ASIA-PACIFIC, AMERICAS, AND EUROPE REGIONS INCREASED BY 31%, 29%, 21%, AND 6%, RESPECTIVELY, COMPARED TO 2009.

OUR

OVERALL GROSS MARGIN DOLLARS FOR 2010 INCREASED $8.9 BILLION, OR 46%, COMPARED TO 2009. THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER REVENUE. TO A LESSER EXTENT, EXCESS CAPACITY CHARGES RECORDED IN 2009 OF $1.1 BILLION AND LOWER PLATFORM

UNIT COSTS CONTRIBUTED TO THE INCREASE IN GROSS MARGIN DOLLARS FOR 2010 COMPARED TO 2009. THESE INCREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY CHARGES RECORDED IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2010 TO REPAIR AND REPLACE MATERIALS AND SYSTEMS IMPACTED BY A DESIGN ISSUE

RELATED TO OUR INTEL

ISSUE IN PART II, ITEM 8 OF THIS FORM 10-K.

OUR OVERALL GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE INCREASED TO 65.3% IN 2010 FROM 55.7% IN 2009. THE INCREASE

IN GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE INCREASE IN THE PC CLIENT GROUP OPERATING SEGMENT AND, TO A LESSER EXTENT, GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE INCREASES IN THE DATA CENTER GROUP, THE OTHER INTEL ARCHITECTURE

OPERATING SEGMENTS, AND THE NON-VOLATILE MEMORY SOLUTIONS GROUP. WE DERIVED MOST OF OUR OVERALL GROSS MARGIN DOLLARS IN 2010 AND 2009 FROM THE SALE OF PLATFORMS IN THE PC CLIENT GROUP AND DATA CENTER GROUP OPERATING SEGMENTS.

NET REVENUE FOR THE PCCG OPERATING SEGMENT INCREASED BY $5.1 BILLION, OR 17%, IN 2011 COMPARED TO 2010. PLATFORMS WITHIN PCCG

INCLUDE THOSE DESIGNED FOR THE NOTEBOOK AND DESKTOP COMPUTING MARKET SEGMENTS. THE INCREASE IN REVENUE WAS DUE TO HIGHER NOTEBOOK PLATFORM UNIT SALES AND HIGHER NOTEBOOK PLATFORM AVERAGE SELLING PRICES. TO A LESSER EXTENT, HIGHER DESKTOP PLATFORM

AVERAGE SELLING PRICES AND SLIGHTLY HIGHER DESKTOP PLATFORM UNIT SALES ALSO CONTRIBUTED TO THE INCREASE.

OPERATING INCOME INCREASED BY $1.8 BILLION IN

2011 COMPARED TO 2010. THE INCREASE IN OPERATING INCOME WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER REVENUE. THE INCREASE WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY APPROXIMATELY $960 MILLION OF HIGHER START-UP COSTS. HIGHER OPERATING EXPENSES, PLATFORM UNIT COSTS, AND

INVENTORY WRITE-OFFS COMPARED TO 2010 ALSO CONTRIBUTED TO THE OFFSET.

FOR 2010, NET REVENUE FOR THE PCCG OPERATING SEGMENT INCREASED BY $5.4 BILLION,

OR 22%, IN 2010 COMPARED TO 2009. SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER NOTEBOOK PLATFORM UNIT SALES WERE THE PRIMARY DRIVER FOR THE INCREASE IN REVENUE. TO A LESSER EXTENT, HIGHER DESKTOP PLATFORM UNIT SALES AND SLIGHTLY HIGHER NOTEBOOK PLATFORM AVERAGE SELLING

PRICES ALSO CONTRIBUTED TO THE INCREASE.

OPERATING INCOME INCREASED BY $5.5 BILLION IN 2010 COMPARED TO 2009. THE INCREASE IN

OPERATING INCOME WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER REVENUE. DURING 2009, PCCG RECOGNIZED APPROXIMATELY $1.0 BILLION OF EXCESS CAPACITY CHARGES. ADDITIONALLY, LOWER PLATFORM UNIT COSTS IN 2010 CONTRIBUTED TO THE INCREASE IN OPERATING INCOME.

THESE IMPACTS WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY CHARGES RECORDED IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2010 TO REPAIR AND REPLACE MATERIALS AND SYSTEMS IMPACTED BY A DESIGN ISSUE RELATED TO OUR INTEL

NET REVENUE FOR THE OTHER IA OPERATING SEGMENTS INCREASED BY $2.0 BILLION, OR 64%, IN 2011 COMPARED TO 2010. THE INCREASE WAS

PRIMARILY DUE TO IMC REVENUE, AN OPERATING SEGMENT FORMED FROM THE ACQUISITION OF THE WLS BUSINESS OF INFINEON IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2011. TO A LESSER EXTENT, SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER EMBEDDED PLATFORM UNIT SALES WITHIN ISG ALSO CONTRIBUTED TO THE

INCREASE. THESE INCREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER NETBOOK PLATFORM UNIT SALES WITHIN NTG.

OPERATING RESULTS FOR THE OTHER IA

OPERATING SEGMENTS DECREASED BY $847 MILLION FROM AN OPERATING INCOME OF $270 MILLION IN 2010 TO AN OPERATING LOSS OF $577 MILLION IN 2011. THE DECLINE IN OPERATING RESULTS WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER OPERATING EXPENSES WITHIN EACH OF THE OTHER IA

OPERATING SEGMENTS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER REVENUE.

FOR 2010, NET REVENUE FOR THE OTHER IA OPERATING SEGMENTS INCREASED BY $372 MILLION, OR 14%, IN

2010 COMPARED TO 2009. THE INCREASE WAS DUE TO SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER EMBEDDED PLATFORM UNIT SALES WITHIN ISG.

OPERATING RESULTS FOR THE OTHER IA

OPERATING SEGMENTS INCREASED BY $315 MILLION, FROM AN OPERATING LOSS OF $45 MILLION IN 2009 TO AN OPERATING INCOME OF $270 MILLION IN 2010. THE INCREASE IN OPERATING RESULTS WAS DUE TO HIGHER REVENUE AND LOWER NETBOOK PLATFORM UNIT COSTS WITHIN NTG.

TO A LESSER EXTENT, LOWER EMBEDDED PLATFORM UNIT COSTS WITHIN ISG ALSO CONTRIBUTED TO THE INCREASE. THESE INCREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER OPERATING EXPENSES IN NTG AND ISG.

NET REVENUE FOR THE SOFTWARE AND SERVICES OPERATING SEGMENTS INCREASED BY $1.6 BILLION IN 2011 COMPARED TO 2010. THE INCREASE WAS

DUE TO REVENUE FROM MCAFEE, WHICH WAS ACQUIRED DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2011. DUE TO THE REVALUATION OF MCAFEES HISTORIC DEFERRED REVENUE TO FAIR VALUE, WE EXCLUDED $204 MILLION OF REVENUE THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN REPORTED IN 2011 IF

MCAFEES DEFERRED REVENUE HAD NOT BEEN WRITTEN DOWN DUE TO THE ACQUISITION.

THE OPERATING LOSS FOR THE SOFTWARE AND SERVICES OPERATING SEGMENTS DECREASED BY $143 MILLION IN 2011 COMPARED TO

2010. THE DECREASE WAS DUE TO HIGHER REVENUE, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER OPERATING EXPENSE ACROSS EACH OF THE SOFTWARE AND SERVICES OPERATING SEGMENTS. DUE TO THE REVALUATION OF MCAFEES HISTORIC DEFERRED REVENUE TO FAIR VALUE AT THE TIME OF

ACQUISITION, WE EXCLUDED REVENUE AND ASSOCIATED COSTS THAT WOULD HAVE INCREASED OPERATING RESULTS BY $190 MILLION IN 2011.

FOR 2010, NET REVENUE FOR THE

SOFTWARE AND SERVICES OPERATING SEGMENTS INCREASED BY $149 MILLION IN 2010 COMPARED TO 2009. THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER REVENUE FROM THE WIND RIVER SOFTWARE GROUP. WE ACQUIRED WIND RIVER SYSTEMS, INC. DURING THE THIRD

QUARTER OF 2009.

THE OPERATING LOSS FOR THE SOFTWARE AND SERVICES OPERATING SEGMENTS INCREASED BY $75 MILLION IN 2010 COMPARED TO 2009. THE INCREASE IN

OPERATING LOSSES WAS DUE TO HIGHER OPERATING EXPENSES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER REVENUE WITHIN THE WIND RIVER SOFTWARE GROUP.

OVERALL PROCESS DEVELOPMENT COSTS DUE TO THE TRANSITION TO MANUFACTURING START-UP COSTS RELATED TO OUR 22NM PROCESS TECHNOLOGY WERE MOSTLY OFFSET BY HIGHER PROCESS DEVELOPMENT COSTS DUE TO R&D OF OUR NEXT-GENERATION 14NM PROCESS TECHNOLOGY. THE

INCREASE IN 2010 COMPARED TO 2009 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER PROFIT-DEPENDENT COMPENSATION, AN INCREASE IN EMPLOYEES, AND HIGHER PROCESS DEVELOPMENT COSTS AS WE TRANSITIONED FROM MANUFACTURING START-UP COSTS RELATED TO OUR 32NM PROCESS TECHNOLOGY

TO R&D OF OUR 22NM PROCESS TECHNOLOGY.

INCREASED $1.4 BILLION, OR 22%, IN 2011 COMPARED TO 2010, AND DECREASED $1.6 BILLION, OR 20%, IN 2010 COMPARED TO 2009. THE INCREASE IN 2011

COMPARED TO 2010 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE EXPENSES OF MCAFEE AND IMC, HIGHER COMPENSATION EXPENSES BASED ON AN INCREASE IN EMPLOYEES, AND HIGHER ADVERTISING EXPENSES (INCLUDING COOPERATIVE

ADVERTISING EXPENSES). THE DECREASE IN 2010 COMPARED TO 2009 WAS DUE TO THE 2009 CHARGE OF $1.447 BILLION INCURRED AS A RESULT OF THE FINE IMPOSED BY THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION (EC) AND THE $1.25 BILLION PAYMENT TO AMD IN 2009 AS PART OF A SETTLEMENT

AGREEMENT. THESE DECREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER ADVERTISING EXPENSES (INCLUDING COOPERATIVE ADVERTISING EXPENSES), HIGHER PROFIT-DEPENDENT COMPENSATION, AND, TO A LESSER EXTENT, EXPENSES RELATED TO OUR WIND RIVER SOFTWARE GROUP OPERATING

SEGMENT AND AN EXPENSE OF $100 MILLION RECOGNIZED DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2010 DUE TO A PATENT CROSS-LICENSE AGREEMENT THAT WE ENTERED INTO WITH NVIDIA IN JANUARY 2011 (SEE NOTE 17: IDENTIFIED INTANGIBLE ASSETS IN PART II,

ITEM 8 OF THIS FORM 10-K).

MERGER TRANSACTIONS, LOWER IMPAIRMENT CHARGES, AND LOWER EQUITY METHOD LOSSES COMPARED TO 2009.

NET GAINS ON EQUITY INVESTMENTS FOR 2011 INCLUDED A

GAIN OF $150 MILLION ON THE SALE OF SHARES IN VMWARE, INC. DURING 2010, WE RECOGNIZED A GAIN OF $181 MILLION ON THE INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERING OF SMART TECHNOLOGIES, INC. AND SUBSEQUENT PARTIAL SALE OF OUR SHARES IN THE SECONDARY OFFERING. WE ALSO

RECOGNIZED A GAIN OF $91 MILLION ON THE SALE OF OUR OWNERSHIP INTEREST IN NUMONYX B.V., AND A GAIN OF $67 MILLION ON THE SALE OF SHARES IN MICRON IN 2010.

NET GAINS (LOSSES) ON EQUITY INVESTMENTS ALSO INCLUDED OUR PROPORTIONATE SHARE OF THE INCOME OR LOSS FROM CLEARWIRE COMMUNICATIONS, LLC (CLEARWIRE LLC) ($145 MILLION LOSS IN 2011, $116 MILLION LOSS IN 2010, AND $27

MILLION LOSS IN 2009) AND NUMONYX ($42 MILLION GAIN IN 2010 AND $31 MILLION LOSS IN 2009). THE EQUITY METHOD LOSSES RECOGNIZED IN 2011 REDUCED OUR CARRYING VALUE IN CLEARWIRE LLC TO ZERO. WE DO NOT EXPECT TO RECOGNIZE ADDITIONAL EQUITY METHOD LOSSES

FOR CLEARWIRE LLC IN THE FUTURE. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION, SEE NOTE 11: EQUITY METHOD AND COST METHOD INVESTMENTS IN PART II, ITEM 8 OF THIS FORM 10-K.

INTEREST AND OTHER, NET INCREASED IN 2011 COMPARED TO 2010, PRIMARILY DUE TO A $164 MILLION GAIN RECOGNIZED UPON

FORMATION OF THE INTEL-GE CARE INNOVATIONS, LLC JOINT VENTURE DURING 2011. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION, SEE NOTE 11: EQUITY METHOD AND COST METHOD INVESTMENTS, IN PART II, ITEM 8 OF THIS FORM 10-K. THE GAIN WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE

RECOGNITION OF $41 MILLION OF INTEREST EXPENSE IN 2011 COMPARED TO ZERO IN 2010 AND LOWER INTEREST INCOME IN 2011 COMPARED TO 2010 AS A RESULT OF LOWER AVERAGE INVESTMENT BALANCES. WE RECOGNIZED INTEREST EXPENSE IN 2011 DUE TO THE ISSUANCE OF $5.0

BILLION AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL OF SENIOR UNSECURED NOTES IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2011.

INTEREST AND OTHER, NET WAS LOWER IN 2010 COMPARED TO 2009 ON LOWER

INTEREST INCOME. INTEREST INCOME WAS LOWER AS A RESULT OF LOWER AVERAGE INTEREST RATES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER AVERAGE INVESTMENT BALANCES. THE AVERAGE INTEREST RATE EARNED DURING 2010 DECREASED BY APPROXIMATELY 0.5 PERCENTAGE POINTS COMPARED TO

2009. IN ADDITION, LOWER FAIR VALUE GAINS ON OUR TRADING ASSETS (ZERO IN 2010 AND $70 MILLION IN 2009) WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER EXCHANGE RATE LOSSES (ZERO IN 2010 AND $40 MILLION IN 2009). EXCHANGE RATE LOSSES IN 2009 WERE DUE TO EURO EXPOSURE

RELATED TO OUR EURO-DENOMINATED LIABILITY FOR THE EC FINE OF $1.447 BILLION IN 2009. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ON THE EC FINE, SEE NOTE 29: CONTINGENCIES IN PART II, ITEM 8 OF THIS FORM 10-K.

OPERATING ACTIVITIES

CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES IS NET INCOME ADJUSTED FOR CERTAIN NON-CASH ITEMS AND CHANGES IN CERTAIN ASSETS AND LIABILITIES.

FOR 2011 COMPARED TO 2010, THE $4.3 BILLION INCREASE IN CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES WAS DUE TO ADJUSTMENTS FOR NON-CASH ITEMS AND HIGHER NET INCOME. THE ADJUSTMENTS FOR NON-CASH ITEMS WERE HIGHER FOR 2011

COMPARED TO 2010 PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION OF INTANGIBLES, AS WELL AS INCREASES IN NON-ACQUISITION-RELATED DEFERRED TAX LIABILITIES AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2011 COMPARED TO DECEMBER 25, 2010. INCOME TAXES PAID, NET

OF REFUNDS, IN 2011 COMPARED TO 2010 WERE $1.3 BILLION LOWER, LARGELY DUE TO THE TAX BENEFIT OF DEPRECIATING 100% OF ASSETS PLACED IN SERVICE IN THE UNITED STATES IN 2011.

CHANGES IN ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2011 COMPARED TO DECEMBER 25, 2010 INCLUDED THE FOLLOWING.



INCOME TAXES PAYABLE INCREASED AND INCOME TAXES RECEIVABLE DECREASED DUE TO TIMING OF PAYMENTS.



ACCOUNTS PAYABLE INCREASED DUE TO BUSINESS GROWTH AS WELL AS AN INCREASE IN CAPITAL SPENDING.



ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE INCREASED DUE TO HIGHER REVENUE IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2011.

FOR 2011, OUR TWO LARGEST CUSTOMERS ACCOUNTED FOR 34% OF OUR NET REVENUE (38% IN 2010 AND 2009), WITH ONE OF THESE CUSTOMERS ACCOUNTING FOR 19% OF OUR NET REVENUE (21% IN 2010 AND 2009), AND ANOTHER CUSTOMER

ACCOUNTING FOR 15% OF OUR NET REVENUE (17% IN 2010 AND 2009). THESE TWO LARGEST CUSTOMERS ACCOUNTED FOR 32% OF OUR ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2011 (44% AS OF DECEMBER 25, 2010).

FOR 2010 COMPARED TO 2009, THE $5.5 BILLION INCREASE IN CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES WAS DUE TO HIGHER NET

INCOME, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY ADJUSTMENTS FOR NON-CASH ITEMS. INCOME TAXES PAID, NET OF REFUNDS, IN 2010 COMPARED TO 2009 WERE $3.7 BILLION HIGHER, PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER INCOME BEFORE TAXES IN 2010.

INVESTING ACTIVITIES

INVESTING CASH

FLOWS CONSIST PRIMARILY OF CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, INVESTMENT PURCHASES, SALES, MATURITIES, AND DISPOSALS, AS WELL AS CASH USED FOR ACQUISITIONS.

CASH

USED FOR INVESTING ACTIVITIES DECREASED SLIGHTLY IN 2011 COMPARED TO 2010. A DECREASE DUE TO NET MATURITIES AND SALES OF AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE INVESTMENTS IN 2011, AS COMPARED TO NET PURCHASES OF AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE INVESTMENTS IN 2010, WAS OFFSET BY

HIGHER CASH PAID FOR ACQUISITIONS, OF WHICH THE SUBSTANTIAL MAJORITY WAS FOR OUR ACQUISITION OF MCAFEE IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2011, AND AN INCREASE IN CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AS WE BUILD AND EQUIP OUR 22NM PROCESS TECHNOLOGY MANUFACTURING CAPACITY.

OUR CAPITAL EXPENDITURES WERE $10.8 BILLION IN 2011 ($5.2 BILLION IN 2010 AND $4.5 BILLION IN 2009) DUE TO EXPANDING OUR NETWORK OF FABRICATION FACILITIES TO INCLUDE AN ADDITIONAL LARGE-SCALE FABRICATION FACILITY AS WELL AS BRINGING OUR 22NM PROCESS

TECHNOLOGY MANUFACTURING CAPACITY ONLINE IN 2011.

THE INCREASE IN CASH USED FOR INVESTING ACTIVITIES IN 2010 COMPARED TO 2009 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO AN

INCREASE IN NET PURCHASES OF AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE INVESTMENTS AND, TO A LESSER EXTENT, HIGHER CAPITAL EXPENDITURES. THESE INCREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECREASE IN NET PURCHASES OF TRADING ASSETS AND LOWER CASH PAID FOR ACQUISITIONS.

FINANCING ACTIVITIES

FINANCING CASH FLOWS CONSIST PRIMARILY OF REPURCHASES OF COMMON STOCK, PAYMENT OF DIVIDENDS TO STOCKHOLDERS, ISSUANCE AND REPAYMENT OF LONG-TERM DEBT, AND PROCEEDS FROM THE SALE OF SHARES THROUGH EMPLOYEE EQUITY

INCENTIVE PLANS.

THE INCREASE IN CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES IN 2011 COMPARED TO 2010 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER REPURCHASES OF COMMON STOCK

UNDER OUR AUTHORIZED COMMON STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE ISSUANCE OF LONG-TERM DEBT IN 2011 AND HIGHER PROCEEDS FROM THE SALE OF SHARES THROUGH EMPLOYEE EQUITY INCENTIVE PLANS. WE HAVE AN ONGOING AUTHORIZATION, SINCE OCTOBER

2005, AS AMENDED, FROM OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS TO REPURCHASE UP TO $45 BILLION IN SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK IN OPEN MARKET OR NEGOTIATED TRANSACTIONS. THIS AMOUNT INCLUDES $20 BILLION OF INCREASES IN THE AUTHORIZATION LIMIT APPROVED BY OUR

BOARD OF DIRECTORS IN 2011. DURING 2011, WE REPURCHASED $14.1 BILLION OF COMMON STOCK UNDER OUR AUTHORIZED COMMON STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM COMPARED TO $1.5 BILLION IN 2010. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2011, $10.1 BILLION REMAINED AVAILABLE FOR

REPURCHASE UNDER THE EXISTING REPURCHASE AUTHORIZATION LIMIT. WE BASE OUR LEVEL OF COMMON STOCK REPURCHASES ON INTERNAL CASH MANAGEMENT DECISIONS, AND THIS LEVEL MAY FLUCTUATE. PROCEEDS FROM THE SALE OF SHARES THROUGH EMPLOYEE EQUITY INCENTIVE PLANS

TOTALED $2.0 BILLION IN 2011 COMPARED TO $587 MILLION IN 2010. OUR TOTAL DIVIDEND PAYMENTS WERE $4.1 BILLION IN 2011 COMPARED TO $3.5 BILLION IN 2010 AS A RESULT OF INCREASES IN QUARTERLY CASH DIVIDENDS PER COMMON SHARE. WE HAVE PAID A CASH DIVIDEND

IN EACH OF THE PAST 77 QUARTERS. IN JANUARY 2012, OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS DECLARED A CASH DIVIDEND OF $0.21 PER COMMON SHARE FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2012. THE DIVIDEND IS PAYABLE ON MARCH 1, 2012 TO STOCKHOLDERS OF RECORD ON FEBRUARY 7,

2012.

THE INCREASE IN CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES IN 2010 COMPARED TO 2009 WAS DUE TO THE ISSUANCE OF LONG-TERM DEBT IN 2009.

LIQUIDITY

CASH GENERATED BY

OPERATIONS IS OUR PRIMARY SOURCE OF LIQUIDITY. WE MAINTAIN A DIVERSE PORTFOLIO THAT WE CONTINUOUSLY ANALYZE BASED ON ISSUER, INDUSTRY, AND COUNTRY. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2011, CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS, SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS, AND MARKETABLE DEBT

INSTRUMENTS INCLUDED IN TRADING ASSETS TOTALED $14.8 BILLION ($21.5 BILLION AS OF

DECEMBER 25, 2010). IN ADDITION TO THE $14.8 BILLION, WE HAVE $1.8 BILLION IN LOANS RECEIVABLE AND OTHER LONG-TERM INVESTMENTS THAT WE INCLUDE WHEN ASSESSING OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO.

SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR INVESTMENTS IN DEBT INSTRUMENTS ARE WITH A/A2 OR BETTER RATED ISSUERS, AND A MAJORITY OF THE ISSUERS ARE RATED AA-/AA3 OR BETTER. AS CERTAIN COUNTRIES IN EUROPE ARE EXPERIENCING ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTY, WE CONTINUE TO MONITOR

THE CREDIT QUALITY OF OUR EUROPEAN SOVEREIGN AND NON-SOVEREIGN DEBT INVESTMENTS. THE CREDIT QUALITY OF OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO WITHIN THE EUROPEAN REGION REMAINS HIGH, WITH SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR SOVEREIGN DEBT INVESTMENTS WITH AA-/AA3 OR BETTER

RATED ISSUERS, AND MOST OF THE NON-SOVEREIGN DEBT ISSUERS RATED A/A2 OR BETTER. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2011, OUR TOTAL INVESTMENTS LOCATED IN SPAIN, ITALY, IRELAND, GREECE, AND PORTUGAL WERE APPROXIMATELY $50 MILLION, ALL OF WHICH MATURES IN 2012.

WE HAVE $1 MILLION IN UNREALIZED LOSSES RELATED TO THESE INVESTMENTS. THESE COUNTRIES HAVE EXPERIENCED SIGNIFICANT ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTY AND CREDIT DOWNGRADES, SO WE WILL ONLY MAKE INVESTMENTS IN THESE COUNTRIES IN THE FUTURE IF THEIR RISK PROFILE

MEETS OUR INVESTMENT OBJECTIVES.

OUR COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAM PROVIDES ANOTHER POTENTIAL SOURCE OF LIQUIDITY. WE HAVE AN ONGOING AUTHORIZATION FROM OUR

BOARD OF DIRECTORS TO BORROW UP TO $3.0 BILLION, INCLUDING THROUGH THE ISSUANCE OF COMMERCIAL PAPER. MAXIMUM BORROWINGS UNDER OUR COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAM DURING 2011 WERE $1.4 BILLION, AND $200 MILLION OF COMMERCIAL PAPER REMAINED OUTSTANDING AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2011. OUR COMMERCIAL PAPER WAS RATED A-1+ BY STANDARD & POORS AND P-1 BY MOODYS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2011. WE ALSO HAVE AN AUTOMATIC SHELF REGISTRATION STATEMENT ON FILE WITH THE SEC PURSUANT TO WHICH WE MAY

OFFER AN UNSPECIFIED AMOUNT OF DEBT, EQUITY, AND OTHER SECURITIES. IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2011, WE UTILIZED THIS SHELF REGISTRATION STATEMENT AND ISSUED $5.0 BILLION AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL OF SENIOR UNSECURED NOTES. THESE NOTES WERE ISSUED PRIMARILY

TO REPURCHASE SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK PURSUANT TO OUR COMMON STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM, AND FOR GENERAL CORPORATE PURPOSES. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ON THE TERMS OF THE NOTES, SEE NOTE 21: BORROWINGS IN PART II, ITEM 8 OF THIS FORM

10-K.

WE BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE THE FINANCIAL RESOURCES NEEDED TO MEET BUSINESS REQUIREMENTS FOR THE NEXT 12 MONTHS, INCLUDING CAPITAL EXPENDITURES FOR

WORLDWIDE MANUFACTURING AND ASSEMBLY AND TEST; WORKING CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS; AND POTENTIAL DIVIDENDS, COMMON STOCK REPURCHASES, AND ACQUISITIONS OR STRATEGIC INVESTMENTS.

FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

WHEN DETERMINING FAIR VALUE, WE CONSIDER THE PRINCIPAL OR MOST ADVANTAGEOUS MARKET IN WHICH WE WOULD TRANSACT, AND WE CONSIDER ASSUMPTIONS THAT MARKET PARTICIPANTS WOULD USE WHEN PRICING THE ASSET OR LIABILITY. FOR

FURTHER INFORMATION, SEE FAIR VALUE IN NOTE 2: ACCOUNTING POLICIES IN PART II, ITEM 8 OF THIS FORM 10-K.

CREDIT RISK IS

FACTORED INTO THE VALUATION OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS THAT WE MEASURE AND RECORD AT FAIR VALUE. WHEN FAIR VALUE IS DETERMINED USING PRICING MODELS, SUCH AS A DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW MODEL, THE ISSUERS CREDIT RISK OR INTELS CREDIT RISK IS

FACTORED INTO THE CALCULATION OF THE FAIR VALUE, AS APPROPRIATE.

MARKETABLE DEBT INSTRUMENTS

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2011, OUR ASSETS MEASURED AND RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE ON A RECURRING BASIS INCLUDED $15.1 BILLION OF MARKETABLE DEBT INSTRUMENTS. OF THESE

INSTRUMENTS, $6.1 BILLION WAS CLASSIFIED AS LEVEL 1, $8.7 BILLION AS LEVEL 2, AND $218 MILLION AS LEVEL 3.

OUR BALANCE OF MARKETABLE DEBT INSTRUMENTS

THAT ARE MEASURED AND RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE ON A RECURRING BASIS AND CLASSIFIED AS LEVEL 1 WAS CLASSIFIED AS SUCH DUE TO THE USE OF OBSERVABLE MARKET PRICES FOR IDENTICAL SECURITIES THAT ARE TRADED IN ACTIVE MARKETS. MANAGEMENT JUDGMENT WAS

REQUIRED TO DETERMINE THE LEVELS FOR THE FREQUENCY OF TRANSACTIONS THAT SHOULD BE MET FOR A MARKET TO BE CONSIDERED ACTIVE. OUR ASSESSMENT OF AN ACTIVE MARKET FOR OUR MARKETABLE DEBT INSTRUMENTS GENERALLY TAKES INTO CONSIDERATION THE NUMBER OF DAYS

EACH INDIVIDUAL INSTRUMENT TRADES OVER A SPECIFIED PERIOD.

OF THE $8.7 BILLION BALANCE OF MARKETABLE DEBT INSTRUMENTS MEASURED AND RECORDED AT FAIR

VALUE ON A RECURRING BASIS AND CLASSIFIED AS LEVEL 2, APPROXIMATELY 60% OF THE BALANCE WAS

CLASSIFIED AS LEVEL 2 DUE TO THE USE OF A DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW MODEL AND APPROXIMATELY 40% DUE TO THE USE OF NON-BINDING MARKET CONSENSUS PRICES THAT WERE CORROBORATED WITH OBSERVABLE MARKET

DATA.

OUR MARKETABLE DEBT INSTRUMENTS THAT ARE MEASURED AND RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE ON A RECURRING BASIS AND CLASSIFIED AS LEVEL 3 WERE CLASSIFIED AS

SUCH DUE TO THE LACK OF OBSERVABLE MARKET DATA TO CORROBORATE EITHER THE NON-BINDING MARKET CONSENSUS PRICES OR THE NON-BINDING BROKER QUOTES. WHEN OBSERVABLE MARKET DATA IS NOT AVAILABLE, WE CORROBORATE OUR FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS USING NON-BINDING

MARKET CONSENSUS PRICES AND NON-BINDING BROKER QUOTES FROM A SECOND SOURCE.

LOANS RECEIVABLE

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2011, OUR ASSETS MEASURED AND RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE ON A RECURRING BASIS INCLUDED $748 MILLION OF LOANS RECEIVABLE. ALL OF THESE

SECURITIES WERE CLASSIFIED AS LEVEL 2, AS THE FAIR VALUE IS DETERMINED USING A DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW MODEL WITH ALL SIGNIFICANT INPUTS DERIVED FROM OR CORROBORATED WITH OBSERVABLE MARKET DATA.

MARKETABLE EQUITY SECURITIES

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2011, OUR ASSETS MEASURED AND

RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE ON A RECURRING BASIS INCLUDED $562 MILLION OF MARKETABLE EQUITY SECURITIES. MOST OF THESE SECURITIES WERE CLASSIFIED AS LEVEL 1 BECAUSE THE VALUATIONS WERE BASED ON QUOTED PRICES FOR IDENTICAL SECURITIES IN ACTIVE MARKETS. OUR

ASSESSMENT OF AN ACTIVE MARKET FOR OUR MARKETABLE EQUITY SECURITIES GENERALLY TAKES INTO CONSIDERATION THE NUMBER OF DAYS THAT EACH INDIVIDUAL EQUITY SECURITY TRADES OVER A SPECIFIED PERIOD.

CAPITAL PURCHASE OBLIGATIONS REPRESENT COMMITMENTS FOR THE CONSTRUCTION OR PURCHASE OF PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT.

THEY WERE NOT RECORDED AS LIABILITIES ON OUR CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2011, AS WE HAD NOT YET RECEIVED THE RELATED GOODS OR TAKEN TITLE TO THE PROPERTY.

2

OTHER PURCHASE OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS INCLUDE PAYMENTS DUE UNDER VARIOUS TYPES OF LICENSES AND AGREEMENTS TO

PURCHASE GOODS OR SERVICES, AS WELL AS PAYMENTS DUE UNDER NON-CONTINGENT FUNDING OBLIGATIONS. FUNDING OBLIGATIONS INCLUDE, FOR EXAMPLE, AGREEMENTS TO FUND VARIOUS PROJECTS WITH OTHER COMPANIES.

3

AMOUNTS REPRESENT PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST CASH PAYMENTS OVER THE LIFE OF THE DEBT OBLIGATIONS, INCLUDING ANTICIPATED

INTEREST PAYMENTS THAT ARE NOT RECORDED ON OUR CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET. ANY FUTURE SETTLEMENT OF CONVERTIBLE DEBT WOULD IMPACT OUR CASH PAYMENTS.

4

WE ARE UNABLE TO RELIABLY ESTIMATE THE TIMING OF FUTURE PAYMENTS RELATED TO UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS; THEREFORE, $165

MILLION OF LONG-TERM INCOME TAXES PAYABLE HAS BEEN EXCLUDED FROM THE PRECEDING TABLE. HOWEVER, LONG-TERM INCOME TAXES PAYABLE, RECORDED ON OUR CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET, INCLUDED THESE UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS, REDUCED BY THE ASSOCIATED FEDERAL

DEDUCTION FOR STATE TAXES AND U.S. TAX CREDITS ARISING FROM NON-U.S. INCOME TAXES.

5

AMOUNTS REPRESENT FUTURE CASH PAYMENTS TO SATISFY OTHER LONG-TERM LIABILITIES RECORDED ON OUR CONSOLIDATED BALANCE

SHEET, INCLUDING THE SHORT-TERM PORTION OF THESE LONG-TERM LIABILITIES. EXPECTED REQUIRED CONTRIBUTIONS TO OUR U.S. AND NON-U.S. PENSION PLANS AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS OF $65 MILLION TO BE MADE DURING 2012 ARE ALSO INCLUDED; HOWEVER,

FUNDING PROJECTIONS BEYOND 2012 ARE NOT PRACTICAL TO ESTIMATE.

6

TOTAL EXCLUDES CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS ALREADY RECORDED ON OUR CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET AS CURRENT LIABILITIES

EXCEPT FOR THE SHORT-TERM PORTIONS OF LONG-TERM DEBT OBLIGATIONS AND OTHER LONG-TERM LIABILITIES.

CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS FOR PURCHASES OF GOODS OR SERVICES INCLUDE AGREEMENTS THAT ARE ENFORCEABLE AND LEGALLY

BINDING ON INTEL AND THAT SPECIFY ALL SIGNIFICANT TERMS, INCLUDING FIXED OR MINIMUM QUANTITIES TO BE PURCHASED; FIXED, MINIMUM, OR VARIABLE PRICE PROVISIONS; AND THE APPROXIMATE TIMING OF THE TRANSACTION. FOR OBLIGATIONS WITH CANCELLATION

PROVISIONS, THE AMOUNTS INCLUDED IN THE PRECEDING TABLE WERE LIMITED TO THE NON-CANCELABLE PORTION OF THE AGREEMENT TERMS OR THE MINIMUM CANCELLATION FEE.

WE HAVE ENTERED INTO CERTAIN AGREEMENTS FOR THE PURCHASE OF RAW MATERIALS THAT SPECIFY MINIMUM PRICES AND QUANTITIES BASED ON A PERCENTAGE OF THE TOTAL AVAILABLE

MARKET OR BASED ON A PERCENTAGE OF OUR FUTURE PURCHASING REQUIREMENTS. DUE TO THE UNCERTAINTY OF THE FUTURE MARKET AND OUR FUTURE

PURCHASING REQUIREMENTS, AS WELL AS THE NON-BINDING NATURE OF THESE AGREEMENTS, OBLIGATIONS UNDER THESE AGREEMENTS ARE NOT INCLUDED IN THE PRECEDING TABLE. OUR PURCHASE ORDERS FOR OTHER PRODUCTS

ARE BASED ON OUR CURRENT MANUFACTURING NEEDS AND ARE FULFILLED BY OUR VENDORS WITHIN SHORT TIME HORIZONS. IN ADDITION, SOME OF OUR PURCHASE ORDERS REPRESENT AUTHORIZATIONS TO PURCHASE RATHER THAN BINDING AGREEMENTS.

CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS THAT ARE CONTINGENT UPON THE ACHIEVEMENT OF CERTAIN MILESTONES ARE NOT INCLUDED IN THE PRECEDING TABLE. THESE OBLIGATIONS INCLUDE

MILESTONE-BASED CO-MARKETING AGREEMENTS, CONTINGENT FUNDING/PAYMENT OBLIGATIONS, AND MILESTONE-BASED EQUITY INVESTMENT FUNDING. THESE ARRANGEMENTS ARE NOT CONSIDERED CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS UNTIL THE MILESTONE IS MET BY THE THIRD PARTY.

FOR THE MAJORITY OF RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS GRANTED, THE NUMBER OF SHARES ISSUED ON THE DATE THE RESTRICTED STOCK

UNITS VEST IS NET OF THE MINIMUM STATUTORY WITHHOLDING REQUIREMENTS THAT WE PAY IN CASH TO THE APPROPRIATE TAXING AUTHORITIES ON BEHALF OF OUR EMPLOYEES. THE OBLIGATION TO PAY THE RELEVANT TAXING AUTHORITY IS NOT INCLUDED IN THE PRECEDING TABLE, AS

THE AMOUNT IS CONTINGENT UPON CONTINUED EMPLOYMENT. IN ADDITION, THE AMOUNT OF THE OBLIGATION IS UNKNOWN, AS IT IS BASED IN PART ON THE MARKET PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK WHEN THE AWARDS VEST.

CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS WITH REGARD TO OUR INVESTMENT IN IMFT/IMFS ARE NOT INCLUDED IN THE PRECEDING TABLE. WE ARE CURRENTLY COMMITTED TO PURCHASING 49% OF IMFTS AND 22% OF IMFSS PRODUCTION OUTPUT AND

PRODUCTION-RELATED SERVICES. WE ALSO HAVE SEVERAL AGREEMENTS WITH MICRON RELATED TO IP, AND R&D FUNDING RELATED TO NON-VOLATILE MEMORY MANUFACTURING. THE OBLIGATION TO PURCHASE OUR PROPORTION OF

IMFT/IMFSS INVENTORY WAS APPROXIMATELY $125 MILLION AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2011. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION, SEE NOTE 11: EQUITY METHOD AND COST METHOD INVESTMENTS IN

PART II, ITEM 8 OF THIS FORM 10-K.

THE EXPECTED TIMING OF PAYMENTS OF THE OBLIGATIONS ABOVE IS ESTIMATED BASED ON CURRENT INFORMATION.

TIMING OF PAYMENTS AND ACTUAL AMOUNTS PAID MAY BE DIFFERENT, DEPENDING ON THE TIME OF RECEIPT OF GOODS OR SERVICES, OR CHANGES TO AGREED-UPON AMOUNTS FOR SOME OBLIGATIONS.

OFF-BALANCE-SHEET ARRANGEMENTS

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2011, WE DID NOT HAVE ANY SIGNIFICANT

OFF-BALANCE-SHEET ARRANGEMENTS, AS DEFINED IN ITEM 303(A)(4)(II) OF SEC REGULATION S-K.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

ITEM 7A.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

WE USE DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS PRIMARILY TO MANAGE CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE AND INTEREST RATE RISK, AND, TO A LESSER EXTENT, EQUITY MARKET RISK. ALL OF THE POTENTIAL CHANGES NOTED BELOW ARE BASED ON

SENSITIVITY ANALYSES PERFORMED ON OUR FINANCIAL POSITIONS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2011 AND DECEMBER 25, 2010. ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER MATERIALLY.

CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES

IN GENERAL, WE ECONOMICALLY HEDGE CURRENCY RISKS OF

NON-U.S.-DOLLAR-DENOMINATED INVESTMENTS IN DEBT INSTRUMENTS AND LOANS RECEIVABLE WITH CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS OR CURRENCY INTEREST RATE SWAPS. GAINS AND LOSSES ON THESE NON-U.S.-CURRENCY INVESTMENTS WOULD GENERALLY BE OFFSET BY CORRESPONDING

LOSSES AND GAINS ON THE RELATED HEDGING INSTRUMENTS, RESULTING IN AN INSIGNIFICANT NET EXPOSURE TO LOSS.

SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR REVENUE IS TRANSACTED

IN U.S. DOLLARS. HOWEVER, A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF OUR OPERATING EXPENDITURES AND CAPITAL PURCHASES IS INCURRED IN OR EXPOSED TO OTHER CURRENCIES, PRIMARILY THE JAPANESE YEN, THE EURO, THE ISRAELI SHEKEL, AND THE CHINESE YUAN. WE HAVE ESTABLISHED

BALANCE SHEET AND FORECASTED TRANSACTION CURRENCY RISK MANAGEMENT PROGRAMS TO PROTECT AGAINST FLUCTUATIONS IN FAIR VALUE AND THE VOLATILITY OF FUTURE CASH FLOWS CAUSED BY CHANGES IN EXCHANGE RATES. WE GENERALLY UTILIZE CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS IN

THESE HEDGING PROGRAMS. OUR HEDGING PROGRAMS REDUCE, BUT DO NOT ALWAYS ENTIRELY ELIMINATE, THE IMPACT OF CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE MOVEMENTS. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION, SEE RISK FACTORS IN PART I, ITEM 1A OF THIS FORM 10-K. WE CONSIDERED

THE HISTORICAL TRENDS IN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES AND DETERMINED THAT IT WAS REASONABLY POSSIBLE THAT A WEIGHTED AVERAGE ADVERSE CHANGE OF 20% IN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES COULD BE EXPERIENCED IN THE NEAR TERM. SUCH AN ADVERSE CHANGE, AFTER TAKING INTO

ACCOUNT BALANCE SHEET HEDGES ONLY AND OFFSETTING RECORDED MONETARY ASSET AND LIABILITY POSITIONS, WOULD HAVE RESULTED IN AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON INCOME BEFORE TAXES OF LESS THAN $40 MILLION AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2011 (LESS THAN $35 MILLION AS OF

DECEMBER 25, 2010).

INTEREST RATES

WE GENERALLY HEDGE INTEREST RATE RISKS OF FIXED-RATE DEBT INSTRUMENTS WITH INTEREST RATE SWAPS. GAINS AND LOSSES ON THESE INVESTMENTS WOULD GENERALLY BE OFFSET BY CORRESPONDING LOSSES AND GAINS ON THE RELATED

HEDGING INSTRUMENTS, RESULTING IN AN INSIGNIFICANT NET EXPOSURE TO INTEREST RATE LOSS.

WE ARE EXPOSED TO INTEREST RATE RISK RELATED TO OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO AND INDEBTEDNESS. OUR INDEBTEDNESS INCLUDES

OUR DEBT ISSUANCES AND THE LIABILITY ASSOCIATED WITH A LONG-TERM PATENT CROSS-LICENSE AGREEMENT WITH NVIDIA. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION, SEE NOTE 17: IDENTIFIED INTANGIBLE ASSETS IN PART II, ITEM 8 OF THIS FORM 10-K. THE PRIMARY

OBJECTIVE OF OUR INVESTMENTS IN DEBT INSTRUMENTS IS TO PRESERVE PRINCIPAL WHILE MAXIMIZING YIELDS, WHICH GENERALLY TRACK THE U.S.-DOLLAR THREE-MONTH LIBOR. A HYPOTHETICAL DECREASE IN INTEREST RATES OF 1.0% WOULD HAVE RESULTED IN AN INCREASE IN THE

FAIR VALUE OF OUR INDEBTEDNESS OF APPROXIMATELY $900 MILLION AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2011 (AN INCREASE OF APPROXIMATELY $250 MILLION AS OF DECEMBER 25, 2010). THE SIGNIFICANT INCREASE FROM DECEMBER 25, 2010 IS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY THE

INCLUSION OF THE $5.0 BILLION OF SENIOR UNSECURED NOTES ISSUED IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2011. A HYPOTHETICAL DECREASE IN INTEREST RATES OF UP TO 1.0%, AFTER TAKING INTO ACCOUNT INVESTMENT HEDGES, WOULD HAVE RESULTED IN AN INCREASE IN THE FAIR VALUE

OF OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO OF APPROXIMATELY $20 MILLION AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2011 (AN INCREASE OF APPROXIMATELY $15 MILLION AS OF DECEMBER 25, 2010). THE FLUCTUATIONS IN FAIR VALUE OF OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO AND INDEBTEDNESS REFLECT ONLY

THE DIRECT IMPACT OF THE CHANGE IN INTEREST RATES. OTHER ECONOMIC VARIABLES, SUCH AS EQUITY MARKET FLUCTUATIONS AND CHANGES IN RELATIVE CREDIT RISK, COULD RESULT IN A SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER DECLINE IN THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR NET INVESTMENT POSITION. FOR

FURTHER INFORMATION ON HOW CREDIT RISK IS FACTORED INTO THE VALUATION OF OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO AND DEBT ISSUANCES, SEE NOTE 5: FAIR VALUE IN PART II, ITEM 8 OF THIS FORM 10-K.

EQUITY PRICES

OUR MARKETABLE EQUITY

INVESTMENTS INCLUDE MARKETABLE EQUITY SECURITIES AND EQUITY DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS SUCH AS WARRANTS AND OPTIONS. TO THE EXTENT THAT OUR MARKETABLE EQUITY SECURITIES HAVE STRATEGIC VALUE, WE TYPICALLY DO NOT ATTEMPT TO REDUCE OR ELIMINATE OUR EQUITY

MARKET EXPOSURE THROUGH HEDGING ACTIVITIES; HOWEVER, FOR OUR INVESTMENTS IN STRATEGIC EQUITY DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS, WE MAY ENTER INTO TRANSACTIONS TO REDUCE OR ELIMINATE THE EQUITY MARKET RISKS. FOR SECURITIES THAT WE NO LONGER CONSIDER STRATEGIC,

WE EVALUATE LEGAL, MARKET, AND ECONOMIC FACTORS IN OUR DECISION ON THE TIMING OF DISPOSAL AND WHETHER IT IS POSSIBLE AND APPROPRIATE TO HEDGE THE EQUITY MARKET RISK.

WE HOLD DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS THAT SEEK TO OFFSET CHANGES IN LIABILITIES RELATED TO THE EQUITY MARKET RISKS OF CERTAIN DEFERRED COMPENSATION ARRANGEMENTS. THE GAINS AND LOSSES FROM CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE OF THESE

DERIVATIVES ARE DESIGNED TO OFFSET THE GAINS AND LOSSES ON THE RELATED LIABILITIES, RESULTING IN AN INSIGNIFICANT NET EXPOSURE TO LOSS.

41

TABLE OF CONTENTS

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2011, THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR MARKETABLE EQUITY INVESTMENTS AND OUR EQUITY DERIVATIVE

INSTRUMENTS, INCLUDING HEDGING POSITIONS, WAS $585 MILLION ($1.5 BILLION AS OF DECEMBER 25, 2010). OUR MARKETABLE EQUITY INVESTMENT IN IMAGINATION TECHNOLOGIES GROUP PLC WAS CARRIED AT A TOTAL FAIR MARKET VALUE OF $327 MILLION, OR 56% OF OUR

MARKETABLE EQUITY PORTFOLIO, AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2011. OUR MARKETABLE EQUITY METHOD INVESTMENTS ARE EXCLUDED FROM OUR ANALYSIS, AS THE CARRYING VALUE DOES NOT FLUCTUATE BASED ON MARKET PRICE CHANGES UNLESS AN OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENT IS

DEEMED NECESSARY. TO DETERMINE REASONABLY POSSIBLE DECREASES IN THE MARKET VALUE OF OUR MARKETABLE EQUITY INVESTMENTS, WE ANALYZED THE EXPECTED MARKET PRICE SENSITIVITY OF OUR MARKETABLE EQUITY INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO. ASSUMING A LOSS OF 45% IN MARKET

PRICES, AND AFTER REFLECTING THE IMPACT OF HEDGES AND OFFSETTING POSITIONS, THE AGGREGATE VALUE OF OUR MARKETABLE EQUITY INVESTMENTS COULD DECREASE BY APPROXIMATELY $265 MILLION, BASED ON THE VALUE AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2011 (A DECREASE IN VALUE

OF APPROXIMATELY $365 MILLION, BASED ON THE VALUE AS OF DECEMBER 25, 2010 USING AN ASSUMED LOSS OF 40%).

MANY OF THE SAME FACTORS THAT COULD RESULT IN AN ADVERSE MOVEMENT OF EQUITY MARKET PRICES AFFECT OUR NON-MARKETABLE

EQUITY INVESTMENTS, ALTHOUGH WE CANNOT ALWAYS QUANTIFY THE IMPACT DIRECTLY. FINANCIAL MARKETS ARE VOLATILE, WHICH COULD NEGATIVELY AFFECT THE PROSPECTS OF THE COMPANIES WE INVEST IN, THEIR ABILITY TO RAISE ADDITIONAL CAPITAL, AND THE LIKELIHOOD OF

OUR BEING ABLE TO REALIZE VALUE IN OUR INVESTMENTS THROUGH LIQUIDITY EVENTS SUCH AS INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERINGS, MERGERS, AND PRIVATE SALES. THESE TYPES OF INVESTMENTS INVOLVE A GREAT DEAL OF RISK, AND THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT ANY SPECIFIC

COMPANY WILL GROW OR BECOME SUCCESSFUL; CONSEQUENTLY, WE COULD LOSE ALL OR PART OF OUR INVESTMENT. OUR NON-MARKETABLE EQUITY INVESTMENTS, EXCLUDING INVESTMENTS ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER THE EQUITY METHOD, HAD A CARRYING AMOUNT OF $1.1 BILLION AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2011 ($872 MILLION AS OF DECEMBER 25, 2010). AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2011, THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF OUR NON-MARKETABLE EQUITY METHOD INVESTMENTS WAS $1.6 BILLION ($1.8 BILLION AS OF DECEMBER 25, 2010). APPROXIMATELY HALF OF

THE TOTAL NON-MARKETABLE EQUITY INVESTMENTS BALANCE AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2011 WAS CONCENTRATED IN OUR IMFT/IMFS INVESTMENT OF $1.3 BILLION ($1.5 BILLION AS OF DECEMBER 25, 2010).

TABLE OF CONTENTS

INTEL CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 1: BASIS OF PRESENTATION

WE HAVE A 52- OR 53-WEEK FISCAL YEAR THAT ENDS ON THE LAST SATURDAY IN DECEMBER. FISCAL YEAR 2011 WAS A 53-WEEK YEAR. FISCAL YEARS 2010 AND 2009

WERE 52-WEEK YEARS. OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDE THE ACCOUNTS OF INTEL CORPORATION AND OUR WHOLLY OWNED SUBSIDIARIES. INTERCOMPANY ACCOUNTS AND TRANSACTIONS HAVE BEEN ELIMINATED. WE USE THE EQUITY METHOD TO ACCOUNT FOR EQUITY

INVESTMENTS IN INSTANCES IN WHICH WE OWN COMMON STOCK OR SIMILAR INTERESTS AND HAVE THE ABILITY TO EXERCISE SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE, BUT NOT CONTROL, OVER THE INVESTEE.

IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2011, WE COMPLETED THE ACQUISITION OF MCAFEE, INC. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION, SEE NOTE 14: ACQUISITIONS. CERTAIN OF THE OPERATIONS ACQUIRED FROM MCAFEE HAVE A FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY

OTHER THAN THE U.S. DOLLAR. AS A RESULT, TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENTS HAVE BEEN RECORDED THROUGH ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS) BEGINNING IN 2011. PRIOR TO THE ACQUISITION OF MCAFEE, THE U.S. DOLLAR WAS THE FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY FOR INTEL

AND ALL OF OUR SUBSIDIARIES; THEREFORE, WE DO NOT HAVE A TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENT RECORDED THROUGH ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS) FOR FISCAL YEARS 2010 AND 2009.

NOTE 2: ACCOUNTING POLICIES

USE OF ESTIMATES

THE PREPARATION OF CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN CONFORMITY WITH U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES REQUIRES US TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND

JUDGMENTS THAT AFFECT THE AMOUNTS REPORTED IN OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND THE ACCOMPANYING NOTES. THE ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES THAT REQUIRE OUR MOST SIGNIFICANT, DIFFICULT, AND SUBJECTIVE JUDGMENTS INCLUDE.



THE VALUATION OF NON-MARKETABLE EQUITY INVESTMENTS AND THE DETERMINATION OF OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENTS;



THE ASSESSMENT OF RECOVERABILITY OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS (PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT; GOODWILL; AND IDENTIFIED INTANGIBLES);



THE RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT OF CURRENT AND DEFERRED INCOME TAXES (INCLUDING THE MEASUREMENT OF UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS);



THE VALUATION OF INVENTORY; AND



THE RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT OF LOSS CONTINGENCIES.

THE ACTUAL RESULTS THAT WE EXPERIENCE MAY DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM OUR ESTIMATES.

FAIR VALUE

FAIR VALUE IS THE PRICE THAT WOULD BE RECEIVED FROM SELLING AN ASSET OR PAID TO TRANSFER A LIABILITY IN AN ORDERLY TRANSACTION BETWEEN MARKET PARTICIPANTS AT THE MEASUREMENT DATE. WHEN DETERMINING FAIR VALUE, WE

CONSIDER THE PRINCIPAL OR MOST ADVANTAGEOUS MARKET IN WHICH WE WOULD TRANSACT, AND WE CONSIDER ASSUMPTIONS THAT MARKET PARTICIPANTS WOULD USE WHEN PRICING THE ASSET OR LIABILITY. OUR FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE MEASURED AND RECORDED AT FAIR

VALUE, EXCEPT FOR EQUITY METHOD INVESTMENTS, COST METHOD INVESTMENTS, COST METHOD LOANS RECEIVABLE, AND MOST OF OUR LIABILITIES.

FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY

THE THREE LEVELS OF

INPUTS THAT MAY BE USED TO MEASURE FAIR VALUE ARE AS FOLLOWS.

LEVEL 1.

QUOTED PRICES IN ACTIVE MARKETS FOR IDENTICAL ASSETS OR

LIABILITIES.

LEVEL 2.

OBSERVABLE INPUTS OTHER THAN LEVEL 1 PRICES, SUCH AS QUOTED PRICES FOR SIMILAR ASSETS OR LIABILITIES, QUOTED

PRICES IN MARKETS WITH INSUFFICIENT VOLUME OR INFREQUENT TRANSACTIONS (LESS ACTIVE MARKETS), OR MODEL-DERIVED VALUATIONS IN WHICH ALL SIGNIFICANT INPUTS ARE OBSERVABLE OR CAN BE DERIVED PRINCIPALLY FROM OR CORROBORATED WITH OBSERVABLE MARKET DATA

FOR SUBSTANTIALLY THE FULL TERM OF THE ASSETS OR LIABILITIES. LEVEL 2 INPUTS ALSO INCLUDE NON-BINDING MARKET CONSENSUS PRICES THAT CAN BE CORROBORATED WITH OBSERVABLE MARKET DATA, AS WELL AS QUOTED PRICES THAT WERE ADJUSTED FOR SECURITY-SPECIFIC

RESTRICTIONS.

LEVEL 3.

UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS TO THE VALUATION METHODOLOGY THAT ARE SIGNIFICANT TO THE MEASUREMENT OF THE FAIR VALUE OF

ASSETS OR LIABILITIES. LEVEL 3 INPUTS ALSO INCLUDE NON-BINDING MARKET CONSENSUS PRICES OR NON-BINDING BROKER QUOTES THAT WE WERE UNABLE TO CORROBORATE WITH OBSERVABLE MARKET DATA.

FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION OF FAIR VALUE, SEE NOTE 5: FAIR VALUE AND NOTE 22: RETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS.

TRADING ASSETS

MARKETABLE DEBT INSTRUMENTS ARE GENERALLY DESIGNATED AS TRADING ASSETS WHEN THE INTEREST RATE OR FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATE RISK IS ECONOMICALLY HEDGED AT INCEPTION WITH A RELATED DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENT OR WHEN THE

MARKETABLE DEBT INSTRUMENT IS USED TO ECONOMICALLY HEDGE FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATE RISK FROM THE REMEASUREMENT OF INTERCOMPANY LOANS. INVESTMENTS DESIGNATED AS TRADING ASSETS ARE REPORTED AT FAIR VALUE. THE GAINS OR LOSSES OF THESE INVESTMENTS ARISING

FROM CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE DUE TO INTEREST RATE AND CURRENCY MARKET FLUCTUATIONS AND CREDIT MARKET VOLATILITY, OFFSET BY LOSSES OR GAINS ON THE RELATED DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND INTERCOMPANY LOANS, ARE RECORDED IN INTEREST AND OTHER, NET. WE ALSO

DESIGNATE CERTAIN FLOATING-RATE SECURITIZED FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, PRIMARILY ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES, AS TRADING ASSETS.

AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE INVESTMENTS

WE

CONSIDER ALL LIQUID AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE DEBT INSTRUMENTS WITH ORIGINAL MATURITIES FROM THE DATE OF PURCHASE OF APPROXIMATELY THREE MONTHS OR LESS TO BE CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS. AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE DEBT INSTRUMENTS WITH ORIGINAL MATURITIES AT THE

DATE OF PURCHASE GREATER THAN APPROXIMATELY THREE MONTHS AND REMAINING MATURITIES OF LESS THAN ONE YEAR ARE CLASSIFIED AS SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS. AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE DEBT INSTRUMENTS WITH REMAINING MATURITIES BEYOND ONE YEAR ARE CLASSIFIED AS OTHER

LONG-TERM INVESTMENTS.

INVESTMENTS THAT WE DESIGNATE AS AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE ARE REPORTED AT FAIR VALUE, WITH UNREALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES, NET OF TAX,

RECORDED IN ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS), EXCEPT AS NOTED IN THE OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENT SECTION BELOW. WE DETERMINE THE COST OF THE INVESTMENT SOLD BASED ON AN AVERAGE COST BASIS AT THE INDIVIDUAL SECURITY

LEVEL. OUR AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE INVESTMENTS INCLUDE.



MARKETABLE DEBT INSTRUMENTS

WHEN THE INTEREST RATE AND FOREIGN CURRENCY RISKS ARE NOT HEDGED AT INCEPTION OF THE INVESTMENT OR WHEN OUR CRITERIA FOR

DESIGNATION AS TRADING ASSETS ARE NOT MET. WE GENERALLY HOLD THESE DEBT INSTRUMENTS TO GENERATE A RETURN COMMENSURATE WITH THE U.S.-DOLLAR THREE-MONTH LIBOR. WE RECORD THE INTEREST INCOME AND REALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES ON THE SALE OF THESE

INSTRUMENTS IN INTEREST AND OTHER, NET.



MARKETABLE EQUITY SECURITIES

WHEN THERE ARE BARRIERS TO MITIGATING EQUITY MARKET RISK THROUGH THE SALE OR USE OF DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AT THE TIME OF

ORIGINAL CLASSIFICATION AND THERE IS NO PLAN TO SELL THE INVESTMENT AT THE TIME OF ORIGINAL CLASSIFICATION. WE ACQUIRE THESE EQUITY INVESTMENTS FOR THE PROMOTION OF BUSINESS AND STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES. TO THE EXTENT THAT THESE INVESTMENTS CONTINUE TO

HAVE STRATEGIC VALUE, WE TYPICALLY DO NOT ATTEMPT TO REDUCE OR ELIMINATE THE EQUITY MARKET RISKS THROUGH HEDGING ACTIVITIES. WE RECORD THE REALIZED GAINS OR LOSSES ON THE SALE OR EXCHANGE OF MARKETABLE EQUITY SECURITIES IN GAINS (LOSSES) ON EQUITY

INVESTMENTS, NET.

NON-MARKETABLE AND OTHER EQUITY INVESTMENTS

OUR NON-MARKETABLE EQUITY AND OTHER EQUITY INVESTMENTS ARE INCLUDED IN OTHER LONG-TERM ASSETS. WE ACCOUNT FOR NON-MARKETABLE EQUITY AND OTHER EQUITY INVESTMENTS

FOR WHICH WE DO NOT HAVE CONTROL OVER THE INVESTEE AS.



EQUITY METHOD INVESTMENTS

WHEN WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO EXERCISE SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE, BUT NOT CONTROL, OVER THE INVESTEE. OUR PROPORTIONATE SHARE OF THE

INCOME OR LOSS IS RECOGNIZED ON A ONE-QUARTER LAG AND IS RECORDED IN GAINS (LOSSES) ON EQUITY INVESTMENTS, NET. EQUITY METHOD INVESTMENTS INCLUDE MARKETABLE AND NON-MARKETABLE INVESTMENTS.



NON-MARKETABLE COST METHOD INVESTMENTS

WHEN THE EQUITY METHOD DOES NOT APPLY. WE RECORD THE REALIZED GAINS OR LOSSES ON THE SALE OF NON-MARKETABLE COST

METHOD INVESTMENTS IN GAINS (LOSSES) ON EQUITY INVESTMENTS, NET.

49

TABLE OF CONTENTS

INTEL CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENT

OUR AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE INVESTMENTS AND NON-MARKETABLE AND OTHER EQUITY INVESTMENTS ARE SUBJECT TO A PERIODIC IMPAIRMENT REVIEW. INVESTMENTS ARE CONSIDERED IMPAIRED

WHEN THE FAIR VALUE IS BELOW THE INVESTMENTS ADJUSTED COST BASIS. IMPAIRMENTS AFFECT EARNINGS AS FOLLOWS.



MARKETABLE DEBT INSTRUMENTS

WHEN THE FAIR VALUE IS BELOW AMORTIZED COST AND WE INTEND TO SELL THE INSTRUMENT, IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT WE WILL BE

REQUIRED TO SELL THE INSTRUMENT BEFORE RECOVERY OF ITS AMORTIZED COST BASIS, OR WE DO NOT EXPECT TO RECOVER THE ENTIRE AMORTIZED COST BASIS OF THE INSTRUMENT (THAT IS, A CREDIT LOSS EXISTS). WHEN WE DO NOT EXPECT TO RECOVER THE ENTIRE AMORTIZED COST

BASIS OF THE INSTRUMENT, OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENTS ARE SEPARATED INTO AMOUNTS REPRESENTING CREDIT LOSSES, WHICH ARE RECOGNIZED IN INTEREST AND OTHER, NET, AND AMOUNTS RELATED TO ALL OTHER FACTORS, WHICH ARE RECOGNIZED IN OTHER COMPREHENSIVE

INCOME (LOSS).



MARKETABLE EQUITY SECURITIES

BASED ON THE SPECIFIC FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES PRESENT AT THE TIME OF ASSESSMENT, WHICH INCLUDE THE CONSIDERATION OF GENERAL

MARKET CONDITIONS, THE DURATION AND EXTENT TO WHICH THE FAIR VALUE IS BELOW COST, AND OUR ABILITY AND INTENT TO HOLD THE INVESTMENT FOR A SUFFICIENT PERIOD OF TIME TO ALLOW FOR RECOVERY IN VALUE IN THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. WE ALSO CONSIDER SPECIFIC

ADVERSE CONDITIONS RELATED TO THE FINANCIAL HEALTH OF, AND BUSINESS OUTLOOK FOR, THE INVESTEE, WHICH MAY INCLUDE INDUSTRY AND SECTOR PERFORMANCE, CHANGES IN TECHNOLOGY, OPERATIONAL AND FINANCING CASH FLOW FACTORS, AND CHANGES IN THE INVESTEES

CREDIT RATING. WE RECORD OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENT CHARGES ON MARKETABLE EQUITY SECURITIES AND MARKETABLE EQUITY METHOD INVESTMENTS IN GAINS (LOSSES) ON EQUITY INVESTMENTS, NET.



NON-MARKETABLE EQUITY INVESTMENTS

BASED ON OUR ASSESSMENT OF THE SEVERITY AND DURATION OF THE IMPAIRMENT, AND QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS,

INCLUDING.



THE INVESTEES REVENUE AND EARNINGS TRENDS RELATIVE TO PRE-DEFINED MILESTONES AND OVERALL BUSINESS PROSPECTS;



THE TECHNOLOGICAL FEASIBILITY OF THE INVESTEES PRODUCTS AND TECHNOLOGIES;



THE GENERAL MARKET CONDITIONS IN THE INVESTEES INDUSTRY OR GEOGRAPHIC AREA, INCLUDING ADVERSE REGULATORY OR ECONOMIC CHANGES;



FACTORS RELATED TO THE INVESTEES ABILITY TO REMAIN IN BUSINESS, SUCH AS THE INVESTEES LIQUIDITY, DEBT RATIOS, AND THE RATE AT WHICH THE INVESTEE IS

USING ITS CASH; AND



THE INVESTEES RECEIPT OF ADDITIONAL FUNDING AT A LOWER VALUATION.

WE RECORD OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENT CHARGES FOR NON-MARKETABLE COST METHOD INVESTMENTS AND

EQUITY METHOD INVESTMENTS IN GAINS (LOSSES) ON EQUITY INVESTMENTS, NET.

DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

OUR PRIMARY OBJECTIVE FOR HOLDING DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS IS TO MANAGE CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE AND INTEREST RATE RISK, AND, TO A LESSER EXTENT, EQUITY

MARKET RISK AND COMMODITY PRICE RISK. OUR DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS ARE RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE AND ARE INCLUDED IN OTHER CURRENT ASSETS, OTHER LONG-TERM ASSETS, OTHER ACCRUED LIABILITIES, OR OTHER LONG-TERM LIABILITIES.

OUR ACCOUNTING POLICIES FOR DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS ARE BASED ON WHETHER THEY MEET THE CRITERIA FOR DESIGNATION AS A CASH FLOW HEDGE. A DESIGNATED HEDGE

OF THE EXPOSURE TO VARIABILITY IN THE FUTURE FOREIGN CURRENCY EQUIVALENT CASH FLOWS OF A FORECASTED TRANSACTION IS REFERRED TO AS A CASH FLOW HEDGE. THE CRITERIA FOR DESIGNATING A DERIVATIVE AS A CASH FLOW HEDGE INCLUDE THE ASSESSMENT OF THE

INSTRUMENTS EFFECTIVENESS IN RISK REDUCTION, MATCHING OF THE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENT TO ITS UNDERLYING TRANSACTION, AND THE ASSESSMENT OF THE PROBABILITY THAT THE UNDERLYING TRANSACTION WILL OCCUR. FOR DERIVATIVES WITH CASH FLOW HEDGE ACCOUNTING

DESIGNATION, WE REPORT THE AFTER-TAX GAIN OR LOSS FROM THE EFFECTIVE PORTION OF THE HEDGE AS A COMPONENT OF ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS) AND RECLASSIFY IT INTO EARNINGS IN THE SAME PERIOD OR PERIODS IN WHICH THE HEDGED TRANSACTION

AFFECTS EARNINGS, AND IN THE SAME LINE ITEM ON THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME AS THE IMPACT OF THE HEDGED TRANSACTION. DERIVATIVES THAT WE DESIGNATE AS CASH FLOW HEDGES ARE CLASSIFIED IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS IN THE SAME

SECTION AS THE UNDERLYING ITEM, PRIMARILY WITHIN CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES.

WE RECOGNIZE GAINS AND LOSSES FROM CHANGES IN FAIR VALUES OF

DERIVATIVES THAT ARE NOT DESIGNATED AS HEDGES FOR ACCOUNTING PURPOSES IN THE LINE ITEM ON THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME MOST CLOSELY ASSOCIATED WITH THE RELATED EXPOSURES, PRIMARILY IN INTEREST AND OTHER, NET AND GAINS (LOSSES) ON EQUITY

INVESTMENTS, NET. AS PART OF OUR STRATEGIC INVESTMENT PROGRAM, WE ALSO ACQUIRE EQUITY DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS, SUCH AS EQUITY CONVERSION RIGHTS ASSOCIATED WITH DEBT INSTRUMENTS, THAT WE DO NOT DESIGNATE AS HEDGING INSTRUMENTS. WE RECOGNIZE THE GAINS

OR LOSSES FROM CHANGES IN FAIR VALUES OF THESE EQUITY DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS IN GAINS (LOSSES) ON EQUITY INVESTMENTS, NET. GAINS AND LOSSES FROM DERIVATIVES NOT DESIGNATED AS HEDGES ARE CLASSIFIED IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS WITHIN

CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

INTEL CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

MEASUREMENT OF EFFECTIVENESS



EFFECTIVENESS FOR FORWARDS

IS GENERALLY MEASURED BY COMPARING THE CUMULATIVE CHANGE IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE HEDGE CONTRACT WITH THE CUMULATIVE CHANGE IN

THE FAIR VALUE OF THE FORECASTED CASH FLOWS OF THE HEDGED ITEM. FOR CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS USED IN CASH FLOW HEDGING STRATEGIES RELATED TO CAPITAL PURCHASES, FORWARD POINTS ARE EXCLUDED, AND EFFECTIVENESS IS MEASURED USING SPOT RATES TO VALUE

BOTH THE HEDGE CONTRACT AND THE HEDGED ITEM. FOR CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS USED IN CASH FLOW HEDGING STRATEGIES RELATED TO OPERATING EXPENDITURES, FORWARD POINTS ARE INCLUDED AND EFFECTIVENESS IS MEASURED USING FORWARD RATES TO VALUE BOTH THE HEDGE

CONTRACT AND THE HEDGED ITEM.



EFFECTIVENESS FOR OPTIONS

IS GENERALLY MEASURED BY COMPARING THE CUMULATIVE CHANGE IN THE INTRINSIC VALUE OF THE HEDGE CONTRACT WITH THE CUMULATIVE CHANGE

IN THE INTRINSIC VALUE OF AN OPTION INSTRUMENT REPRESENTING THE HEDGED RISKS IN THE HEDGED ITEM. TIME VALUE IS EXCLUDED AND EFFECTIVENESS IS MEASURED USING SPOT RATES TO VALUE BOTH THE HEDGE CONTRACT AND THE HEDGED ITEM.



EFFECTIVENESS FOR INTEREST RATE SWAPS AND COMMODITY SWAPS

IS GENERALLY MEASURED BY COMPARING THE CUMULATIVE CHANGE IN FAIR VALUE OF THE SWAP WITH THE

CUMULATIVE CHANGE IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE HEDGED ITEM.

IF A CASH FLOW HEDGE IS DISCONTINUED BECAUSE IT IS NO LONGER PROBABLE THAT

THE ORIGINAL HEDGED TRANSACTION WILL OCCUR AS PREVIOUSLY ANTICIPATED, THE CUMULATIVE UNREALIZED GAIN OR LOSS ON THE RELATED DERIVATIVE IS RECLASSIFIED FROM ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS) INTO EARNINGS. SUBSEQUENT GAINS OR LOSSES ON

THE RELATED DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENT ARE RECOGNIZED IN INTEREST AND OTHER, NET IN EACH PERIOD UNTIL THE INSTRUMENT MATURES, IS TERMINATED, IS RE-DESIGNATED AS A QUALIFIED CASH FLOW HEDGE, OR IS SOLD. INEFFECTIVE PORTIONS OF CASH FLOW HEDGES, AS WELL AS

AMOUNTS EXCLUDED FROM THE ASSESSMENT OF EFFECTIVENESS, ARE RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS IN INTEREST AND OTHER, NET. FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION OF OUR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND RISK MANAGEMENT PROGRAMS, SEE NOTE 8: DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL

WE MAY ENTER INTO SECURITIES LENDING AGREEMENTS WITH FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, GENERALLY TO FACILITATE HEDGING AND CERTAIN INVESTMENT TRANSACTIONS. SELECTED SECURITIES MAY BE LOANED, SECURED BY COLLATERAL IN THE FORM

OF CASH OR SECURITIES. THE LOANED SECURITIES CONTINUE TO BE CARRIED AS INVESTMENT ASSETS ON OUR CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS. CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENT COLLATERAL IS RECORDED AS AN ASSET WITH A CORRESPONDING LIABILITY. FOR LENDING AGREEMENTS

COLLATERALIZED BY OTHER SECURITIES, WE DO NOT RECORD THE COLLATERAL AS AN ASSET OR A LIABILITY, UNLESS THE COLLATERAL IS REPLEDGED.

LOANS RECEIVABLE

WE MAKE LOANS TO

THIRD PARTIES THAT ARE CLASSIFIED WITHIN OTHER CURRENT ASSETS OR OTHER LONG-TERM ASSETS. WE MAY ELECT THE FAIR VALUE OPTION FOR LOANS WHEN THE INTEREST RATE OR FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATE RISK IS ECONOMICALLY HEDGED AT INCEPTION WITH A RELATED DERIVATIVE

INSTRUMENT. WE RECORD THE GAINS OR LOSSES ON THESE LOANS ARISING FROM CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE DUE TO INTEREST RATE, CURRENCY, AND COUNTERPARTY CREDIT CHANGES, MOSTLY OFFSET BY LOSSES OR GAINS ON THE RELATED DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS, IN INTEREST AND

OTHER, NET. LOANS THAT ARE DENOMINATED IN U.S. DOLLARS AND HAVE A FLOATING-RATE COUPON ARE CARRIED AT AMORTIZED COST. WE MEASURE INTEREST INCOME FOR ALL LOANS RECEIVABLE USING THE INTEREST METHOD, WHICH IS BASED ON THE EFFECTIVE YIELD OF THE LOANS

RATHER THAN THE STATED COUPON RATE. FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION OF OUR LOANS RECEIVABLE, SEE NOTE 5: FAIR VALUE.

WE COMPUTE DEPRECIATION FOR FINANCIAL REPORTING PURPOSES USING THE STRAIGHT-LINE METHOD. SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR DEPRECIABLE

PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT ASSETS ARE DEPRECIATED OVER THE FOLLOWING ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES: MACHINERY AND EQUIPMENT, 2 TO 4 YEARS; BUILDINGS, 4 TO 25 YEARS.

WE CAPITALIZE A SUBSTANTIAL MAJORITY OF INTEREST ON BORROWINGS RELATED TO ELIGIBLE CAPITAL EXPENDITURES. CAPITALIZED INTEREST IS ADDED TO THE COST OF QUALIFIED ASSETS AND AMORTIZED OVER THE ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES

OF THE ASSETS. WE RECORD CAPITAL-RELATED GOVERNMENT GRANTS EARNED AS A REDUCTION TO PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT.

GOODWILL

WE RECORD GOODWILL WHEN THE PURCHASE PRICE OF AN ACQUISITION EXCEEDS THE FAIR VALUE OF THE NET TANGIBLE AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS AS OF THE DATE OF

ACQUISITION, ASSIGNING THE GOODWILL TO OUR APPLICABLE REPORTING UNITS BASED ON THE RELATIVE EXPECTED FAIR VALUE PROVIDED BY THE ACQUISITION. WE PERFORM A QUARTERLY REVIEW OF GOODWILL FOR INDICATORS OF IMPAIRMENT. DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF EACH

YEAR, WE PERFORM AN IMPAIRMENT ASSESSMENT FOR EACH REPORTING UNIT, AND IMPAIRMENT TESTS USING A FAIR VALUE APPROACH WHEN NECESSARY. THE REPORTING UNITS CARRYING VALUE USED IN AN IMPAIRMENT TEST REPRESENTS THE ASSIGNMENT OF VARIOUS ASSETS AND

LIABILITIES, EXCLUDING CERTAIN CORPORATE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, SUCH AS CASH, INVESTMENTS, AND DEBT. FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION OF GOODWILL, SEE NOTE 16: GOODWILL.

IDENTIFIED INTANGIBLE ASSETS

LICENSED TECHNOLOGY ASSETS ARE GENERALLY AMORTIZED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THE PERIODS OF BENEFIT. WE AMORTIZE ALL ACQUISITION-RELATED INTANGIBLE ASSETS THAT ARE SUBJECT TO AMORTIZATION OVER THE ESTIMATED

USEFUL LIFE BASED ON ECONOMIC BENEFIT. ACQUISITION-RELATED IN-PROCESS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ASSETS REPRESENT THE FAIR VALUE OF INCOMPLETE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS THAT HAD NOT REACHED TECHNOLOGICAL FEASIBILITY AS OF THE DATE OF

ACQUISITION AND ARE INITIALLY CLASSIFIED AS OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS THAT ARE NOT SUBJECT TO AMORTIZATION. ASSETS RELATED TO PROJECTS THAT HAVE BEEN COMPLETED ARE TRANSFERRED FROM OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS TO

ACQUISITION-RELATED DEVELOPED TECHNOLOGY, AND ARE SUBJECT TO AMORTIZATION, WHILE ASSETS RELATED TO PROJECTS THAT HAVE BEEN ABANDONED ARE IMPAIRED. IN THE QUARTER FOLLOWING THE PERIOD IN WHICH IDENTIFIED INTANGIBLE ASSETS BECOME FULLY

AMORTIZED, THE FULLY AMORTIZED BALANCES ARE REMOVED FROM THE GROSS ASSET AND ACCUMULATED AMORTIZATION AMOUNTS.

WE PERFORM A QUARTERLY REVIEW OF IDENTIFIED INTANGIBLE ASSETS TO DETERMINE IF FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THAT THE USEFUL LIFE

IS SHORTER THAN WE HAD ORIGINALLY ESTIMATED OR THAT THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF ASSETS MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE. IF SUCH FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES EXIST, WE ASSESS RECOVERABILITY BY COMPARING THE PROJECTED UNDISCOUNTED NET CASH FLOWS ASSOCIATED WITH THE

RELATED ASSET OR GROUP OF ASSETS OVER THEIR REMAINING LIVES AGAINST THEIR RESPECTIVE CARRYING AMOUNTS. IMPAIRMENTS, IF ANY, ARE BASED ON THE EXCESS OF THE CARRYING AMOUNT OVER THE FAIR VALUE OF THOSE ASSETS. IF THE USEFUL LIFE IS SHORTER THAN

ORIGINALLY ESTIMATED, WE ACCELERATE THE RATE OF AMORTIZATION AND AMORTIZE THE REMAINING CARRYING VALUE OVER THE NEW SHORTER USEFUL LIFE.

PRODUCT WARRANTY

THE VAST MAJORITY OF OUR PRODUCTS ARE SOLD WITH A LIMITED WARRANTY ON PRODUCT QUALITY AND A LIMITED INDEMNIFICATION FOR CUSTOMERS AGAINST INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS (IP) INFRINGEMENT CLAIMS RELATED TO OUR

PRODUCTS. THE ACCRUAL AND THE RELATED EXPENSE FOR KNOWN PRODUCT WARRANTY ISSUES WERE NOT SIGNIFICANT DURING THE PERIODS PRESENTED. DUE TO PRODUCT TESTING, THE SHORT TIME TYPICALLY BETWEEN PRODUCT SHIPMENT AND THE DETECTION AND CORRECTION OF PRODUCT

FAILURES, AND THE HISTORICAL RATE OF PAYMENTS ON INDEMNIFICATION CLAIMS, THE ACCRUAL AND RELATED EXPENSE FOR ESTIMATED INCURRED BUT UNIDENTIFIED ISSUES WERE NOT SIGNIFICANT DURING THE PERIODS PRESENTED.

REVENUE RECOGNITION

WE RECOGNIZE

NET PRODUCT REVENUE WHEN THE EARNINGS PROCESS IS COMPLETE, AS EVIDENCED BY AN AGREEMENT WITH THE CUSTOMER, TRANSFER OF TITLE, AND ACCEPTANCE, IF APPLICABLE, AS WELL AS FIXED PRICING AND PROBABLE COLLECTIBILITY. WE RECORD PRICING ALLOWANCES,

INCLUDING DISCOUNTS BASED ON CONTRACTUAL ARRANGEMENTS WITH CUSTOMERS, WHEN WE RECOGNIZE REVENUE AS A REDUCTION TO BOTH ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND NET REVENUE. BECAUSE OF FREQUENT SALES PRICE REDUCTIONS AND RAPID TECHNOLOGY OBSOLESCENCE IN THE INDUSTRY,

WE DEFER PRODUCT REVENUE AND RELATED COSTS OF SALES FROM SALES MADE TO DISTRIBUTORS UNDER AGREEMENTS ALLOWING PRICE PROTECTION OR RIGHT OF RETURN UNTIL THE DISTRIBUTORS SELL THE MERCHANDISE. THE RIGHT OF RETURN GRANTED GENERALLY CONSISTS OF A STOCK

ROTATION PROGRAM IN WHICH DISTRIBUTORS ARE ABLE TO EXCHANGE CERTAIN PRODUCTS BASED ON THE NUMBER OF QUALIFIED PURCHASES MADE BY THE DISTRIBUTOR. UNDER THE PRICE PROTECTION PROGRAM, WE GIVE DISTRIBUTORS CREDITS FOR THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE ORIGINAL

PRICE PAID AND THE CURRENT PRICE THAT WE OFFER. WE RECORD THE NET DEFERRED INCOME FROM PRODUCT SALES TO DISTRIBUTORS ON OUR BALANCE SHEET AS DEFERRED INCOME ON SHIPMENTS TO DISTRIBUTORS. WE INCLUDE SHIPPING CHARGES BILLED TO CUSTOMERS IN NET

REVENUE, AND INCLUDE THE RELATED SHIPPING COSTS IN COST OF SALES.

REVENUE FROM LICENSE AGREEMENTS WITH OUR MCAFEE BUSINESS GENERALLY INCLUDES SERVICE

AND SUPPORT AGREEMENTS FOR WHICH THE RELATED REVENUE IS DEFERRED AND RECOGNIZED RATABLY OVER THE PERFORMANCE PERIOD. REVENUE DERIVED FROM ONLINE SUBSCRIPTION PRODUCTS IS DEFERRED AND RECOGNIZED RATABLY OVER THE PERFORMANCE PERIOD. PROFESSIONAL

SERVICES REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED AS SERVICES ARE PERFORMED OR, IF REQUIRED, UPON CUSTOMER ACCEPTANCE. FOR ARRANGEMENTS WITH MULTIPLE

ELEMENTS, INCLUDING SOFTWARE LICENSES, MAINTENANCE, AND/OR SERVICES, REVENUE IS ALLOCATED ACROSS THE SEPARATELY IDENTIFIED DELIVERABLES AND MAY BE RECOGNIZED OR DEFERRED. WHEN VENDOR-SPECIFIC

OBJECTIVE EVIDENCE (VSOE) DOES NOT EXIST FOR UNDELIVERED ELEMENTS SUCH AS MAINTENANCE AND SUPPORT, THE ENTIRE ARRANGEMENT FEE IS RECOGNIZED RATABLY OVER THE PERFORMANCE PERIOD. DIRECT COSTS, SUCH AS COSTS RELATED TO REVENUE-SHARING AND ROYALTY

ARRANGEMENTS ASSOCIATED WITH LICENSE ARRANGEMENTS, AS WELL AS COMPONENT COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH PRODUCT REVENUE, ARE DEFERRED AND AMORTIZED OVER THE SAME PERIOD THAT THE RELATED REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED.

SALES OF SOFTWARE THROUGH OUR WIND RIVER SOFTWARE GROUP ARE MADE THROUGH TERM LICENSES THAT ARE GENERALLY 12 MONTHS IN LENGTH, OR PERPETUAL LICENSES. REVENUE IS

GENERALLY DEFERRED AND RECOGNIZED RATABLY OVER THE COURSE OF THE LICENSE.

ADVERTISING

COOPERATIVE ADVERTISING PROGRAMS REIMBURSE CUSTOMERS FOR MARKETING ACTIVITIES FOR CERTAIN OF OUR PRODUCTS, SUBJECT TO DEFINED CRITERIA. WE ACCRUE COOPERATIVE

ADVERTISING OBLIGATIONS AND RECORD THE COSTS AT THE SAME TIME THAT THE RELATED REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED. WE RECORD COOPERATIVE ADVERTISING COSTS AS MARKETING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES TO THE EXTENT THAT AN ADVERTISING BENEFIT SEPARATE FROM

THE REVENUE TRANSACTION CAN BE IDENTIFIED AND THE FAIR VALUE OF THAT ADVERTISING BENEFIT RECEIVED IS DETERMINABLE. WE RECORD ANY EXCESS IN CASH PAID OVER THE FAIR VALUE OF THE ADVERTISING BENEFIT RECEIVED AS A REDUCTION IN REVENUE. ADVERTISING

COSTS, INCLUDING DIRECT MARKETING COSTS, RECORDED WITHIN MARKETING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES WERE $2.1 BILLION IN 2011 ($1.8 BILLION IN 2010 AND $1.4 BILLION IN 2009).

EMPLOYEE EQUITY INCENTIVE PLANS

WE HAVE EMPLOYEE EQUITY INCENTIVE PLANS, WHICH ARE

DESCRIBED MORE FULLY IN NOTE 24: EMPLOYEE EQUITY INCENTIVE PLANS. WE USE THE STRAIGHT-LINE ATTRIBUTION METHOD TO RECOGNIZE SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION OVER THE SERVICE PERIOD OF THE AWARD. UPON EXERCISE, CANCELLATION, FORFEITURE, OR

EXPIRATION OF STOCK OPTIONS, OR UPON VESTING OR FORFEITURE OF RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS, WE ELIMINATE DEFERRED TAX ASSETS FOR OPTIONS AND RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS WITH MULTIPLE VESTING DATES FOR EACH VESTING PERIOD ON A FIRST-IN, FIRST-OUT BASIS AS IF

EACH VESTING PERIOD WERE A SEPARATE AWARD.

NOTE 3: ACCOUNTING CHANGES

2011

IN THE FIRST

QUARTER OF 2011, WE ADOPTED NEW STANDARDS FOR REVENUE RECOGNITION WITH MULTIPLE DELIVERABLES. THESE NEW STANDARDS CHANGE THE DETERMINATION OF WHETHER THE INDIVIDUAL DELIVERABLES INCLUDED IN A MULTIPLE-ELEMENT ARRANGEMENT MAY BE TREATED AS SEPARATE

UNITS FOR ACCOUNTING PURPOSES. ADDITIONALLY, THESE NEW STANDARDS MODIFY THE METHOD BY WHICH REVENUE IS ALLOCATED TO THE SEPARATELY IDENTIFIED DELIVERABLES. THE ADOPTION OF THESE NEW STANDARDS DID NOT HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON OUR CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2011, WE ADOPTED NEW STANDARDS THAT REMOVE CERTAIN TANGIBLE PRODUCTS AND ASSOCIATED SOFTWARE FROM THE

SCOPE OF THE SOFTWARE REVENUE RECOGNITION GUIDANCE. THE ADOPTION OF THESE NEW STANDARDS DID NOT HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2011, WE ADOPTED AMENDED STANDARDS THAT SIMPLIFY HOW ENTITIES TEST GOODWILL FOR IMPAIRMENT. THESE AMENDED STANDARDS PERMIT AN ASSESSMENT OF QUALITATIVE FACTORS TO DETERMINE WHETHER IT IS

MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT THE FAIR VALUE OF A REPORTING UNIT IN WHICH GOODWILL RESIDES IS LESS THAN ITS CARRYING VALUE. FOR REPORTING UNITS IN WHICH THIS ASSESSMENT CONCLUDES THAT IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT THE FAIR VALUE IS MORE THAN ITS

CARRYING VALUE, THESE AMENDED STANDARDS ELIMINATE THE REQUIREMENT TO PERFORM GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT TESTING. THE ADOPTION OF THESE AMENDED STANDARDS DID NOT HAVE AN IMPACT ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

2010

IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2010, WE

ADOPTED NEW STANDARDS FOR DETERMINING WHETHER TO CONSOLIDATE A VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITY. THESE NEW STANDARDS ELIMINATED A MANDATORY QUANTITATIVE APPROACH IN FAVOR OF A QUALITATIVE ANALYSIS, AND REQUIRE AN ONGOING REASSESSMENT. THE ADOPTION OF THESE

NEW STANDARDS DID NOT IMPACT OUR CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME OR BALANCE SHEETS.

NOTE 4: RECENT ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

IN MAY 2011, THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD (FASB) ISSUED AMENDED STANDARDS TO ACHIEVE A CONSISTENT DEFINITION OF FAIR VALUE AND

COMMON REQUIREMENTS FOR MEASUREMENT OF AND DISCLOSURE ABOUT FAIR VALUE BETWEEN U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES AND INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL REPORTING STANDARDS. FOR ASSETS AND LIABILITIES CATEGORIZED AS LEVEL 3 AND RECOGNIZED AT FAIR

VALUE, THESE AMENDED STANDARDS REQUIRE DISCLOSURE OF QUANTITATIVE INFORMATION ABOUT UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS, A DESCRIPTION OF THE VALUATION PROCESSES USED BY THE ENTITY, AND A QUALITATIVE DISCUSSION ABOUT THE SENSITIVITY OF THE MEASUREMENTS. IN

ADDITION, THESE AMENDED STANDARDS REQUIRE THAT WE DISCLOSE THE LEVEL IN THE FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY FOR FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS DISCLOSED AT FAIR VALUE BUT NOT RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE. THESE NEW STANDARDS ARE EFFECTIVE FOR US BEGINNING IN THE FIRST

QUARTER OF 2012; EARLY ADOPTION OF THESE STANDARDS IS PROHIBITED. WE DO NOT EXPECT THESE NEW STANDARDS TO SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

IN 2011, THE FASB ISSUED AMENDED STANDARDS TO INCREASE THE PROMINENCE OF ITEMS REPORTED IN OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME. THESE AMENDMENTS ELIMINATE THE OPTION TO PRESENT COMPONENTS OF OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME AS

PART OF THE STATEMENT OF CHANGES IN STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY AND REQUIRE THAT ALL CHANGES IN STOCKHOLDERS EQUITYEXCEPT INVESTMENTS BY, AND DISTRIBUTIONS TO, OWNERSBE PRESENTED EITHER IN A SINGLE CONTINUOUS STATEMENT OF

COMPREHENSIVE INCOME OR IN TWO SEPARATE BUT CONSECUTIVE STATEMENTS. THESE NEW STANDARDS ARE EFFECTIVE FOR US BEGINNING IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2012 AND ARE TO BE APPLIED RETROSPECTIVELY. THESE AMENDED STANDARDS WILL IMPACT THE PRESENTATION OF OTHER

COMPREHENSIVE INCOME BUT WILL NOT IMPACT OUR FINANCIAL POSITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

MARKETABLE DEBT INSTRUMENTS

MARKETABLE DEBT INSTRUMENTS INCLUDE INSTRUMENTS SUCH AS COMMERCIAL PAPER, CORPORATE BONDS, GOVERNMENT BONDS, BANK DEPOSITS, ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES, MUNICIPAL BONDS, AND MONEY MARKET FUND DEPOSITS. WHEN WE USE

OBSERVABLE MARKET PRICES FOR IDENTICAL SECURITIES THAT ARE TRADED IN LESS ACTIVE MARKETS, WE CLASSIFY OUR MARKETABLE DEBT INSTRUMENTS AS LEVEL 2. WHEN OBSERVABLE MARKET PRICES FOR IDENTICAL SECURITIES ARE NOT AVAILABLE, WE PRICE OUR MARKETABLE DEBT

INSTRUMENTS USING NON-BINDING MARKET CONSENSUS PRICES THAT ARE CORROBORATED WITH OBSERVABLE MARKET DATA; QUOTED MARKET PRICES FOR SIMILAR INSTRUMENTS; OR PRICING MODELS, SUCH AS A DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW MODEL, WITH ALL SIGNIFICANT INPUTS DERIVED FROM

OR CORROBORATED WITH OBSERVABLE MARKET DATA. NON-BINDING MARKET CONSENSUS PRICES ARE BASED ON THE PROPRIETARY VALUATION MODELS OF PRICING PROVIDERS OR BROKERS. THESE VALUATION MODELS INCORPORATE A NUMBER OF INPUTS,

INCLUDING NON-BINDING AND BINDING BROKER QUOTES; OBSERVABLE MARKET PRICES FOR IDENTICAL OR SIMILAR SECURITIES; AND THE INTERNAL ASSUMPTIONS OF PRICING PROVIDERS OR BROKERS THAT USE OBSERVABLE

MARKET INPUTS AND, TO A LESSER DEGREE, UNOBSERVABLE MARKET INPUTS. WE CORROBORATE NON-BINDING MARKET CONSENSUS PRICES WITH OBSERVABLE MARKET DATA USING STATISTICAL MODELS WHEN OBSERVABLE MARKET DATA EXISTS. THE DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW MODEL USES

OBSERVABLE MARKET INPUTS, SUCH AS LIBOR-BASED YIELD CURVES, CURRENCY SPOT AND FORWARD RATES, AND CREDIT RATINGS.

OUR MARKETABLE DEBT INSTRUMENTS THAT

ARE CLASSIFIED AS LEVEL 3 ARE CLASSIFIED AS SUCH DUE TO THE LACK OF OBSERVABLE MARKET DATA TO CORROBORATE EITHER THE NON-BINDING MARKET CONSENSUS PRICES OR THE NON-BINDING BROKER QUOTES. WHEN OBSERVABLE MARKET DATA IS NOT AVAILABLE, WE CORROBORATE

OUR FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS USING NON-BINDING MARKET CONSENSUS PRICES AND NON-BINDING BROKER QUOTES FROM A SECOND SOURCE.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

INTEL CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

FOR ALL PERIODS PRESENTED, GAINS AND LOSSES (REALIZED AND UNREALIZED) INCLUDED IN EARNINGS WERE PRIMARILY REPORTED

OUTSIDE OF OPERATING INCOME. DURING 2010, WE TRANSFERRED CORPORATE BONDS FROM LEVEL 3 TO LEVEL 2 DUE TO IMPROVED AVAILABILITY OF OBSERVABLE MARKET DATA AND NON-BINDING MARKET CONSENSUS PRICES TO VALUE OR CORROBORATE THE VALUE OF THESE INSTRUMENTS.

OUR POLICY IS TO REFLECT TRANSFERS IN AND TRANSFERS OUT AT THE BEGINNING OF THE QUARTER IN WHICH A CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES RESULTED IN THE TRANSFER.

FAIR VALUE OPTION FOR FINANCIAL ASSETS/LIABILITIES

WE ELECTED THE FAIR VALUE OPTION FOR

LOANS MADE TO THIRD PARTIES WHEN THE INTEREST RATE OR FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATE RISK WAS HEDGED AT INCEPTION WITH A RELATED DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENT. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2011, THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR LOANS RECEIVABLE FOR WHICH WE ELECTED THE FAIR VALUE

OPTION DID NOT SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFER FROM THE CONTRACTUAL PRINCIPAL BALANCE BASED ON THE CONTRACTUAL CURRENCY. THESE LOANS RECEIVABLE ARE CLASSIFIED WITHIN OTHER CURRENT ASSETS AND OTHER LONG-TERM ASSETS. FAIR VALUE IS DETERMINED USING A DISCOUNTED

CASH FLOW MODEL WITH ALL SIGNIFICANT INPUTS DERIVED FROM OR CORROBORATED WITH OBSERVABLE MARKET DATA. GAINS AND LOSSES FROM CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE ON THE LOANS RECEIVABLE AND RELATED DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS, AS WELL AS INTEREST INCOME, ARE RECORDED IN

INTEREST AND OTHER, NET. FOR ALL YEARS PRESENTED, CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR LOANS RECEIVABLE WERE LARGELY OFFSET BY CHANGES IN THE RELATED DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS, RESULTING IN AN INSIGNIFICANT NET IMPACT ON OUR CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF

INCOME. GAINS AND LOSSES ATTRIBUTABLE TO CHANGES IN CREDIT RISK ARE DETERMINED USING OBSERVABLE CREDIT DEFAULT SPREADS FOR THE ISSUER OR COMPARABLE COMPANIES AND WERE INSIGNIFICANT FOR ALL YEARS PRESENTED. WE DID NOT ELECT THE FAIR VALUE OPTION FOR

LOANS WHEN THE INTEREST RATE OR FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATE RISK WAS NOT HEDGED AT INCEPTION WITH A RELATED DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENT.

WE ELECTED THIS FAIR VALUE

OPTION FOR THE BONDS ISSUED IN 2007 BY THE INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY OF THE CITY OF CHANDLER, ARIZONA (2007 ARIZONA BONDS). IN CONNECTION WITH THE 2007 ARIZONA BONDS, WE ENTERED INTO A TOTAL RETURN SWAP AGREEMENT THAT EFFECTIVELY CONVERTS THE

FIXED-RATE OBLIGATION ON THE BONDS TO A FLOATING U.S.-DOLLAR LIBOR-BASED RATE. AS A RESULT, CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THIS DEBT ARE LARGELY OFFSET BY CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE TOTAL RETURN SWAP AGREEMENT, WITHOUT THE NEED TO APPLY HEDGE

ACCOUNTING PROVISIONS. THE 2007 ARIZONA BONDS ARE INCLUDED IN LONG-TERM DEBT. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2011 AND DECEMBER 25, 2010, NO OTHER INSTRUMENTS WERE SIMILAR TO THE 2007 ARIZONA BONDS FOR WHICH WE ELECTED FAIR VALUE TREATMENT.

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2011, THE FAIR VALUE OF THE 2007 ARIZONA BONDS DID NOT SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFER FROM THE CONTRACTUAL PRINCIPAL BALANCE. THE FAIR VALUE OF THE

2007 ARIZONA BONDS WAS DETERMINED USING INPUTS THAT ARE OBSERVABLE IN THE MARKET OR THAT CAN BE DERIVED FROM OR CORROBORATED WITH OBSERVABLE MARKET DATA, AS WELL AS UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS THAT WERE

SIGNIFICANT TO THE FAIR VALUE. GAINS AND LOSSES ON THE 2007 ARIZONA BONDS AND THE RELATED TOTAL RETURN SWAP ARE RECORDED IN INTEREST AND OTHER, NET. WE CAPITALIZE A PORTION OF THE INTEREST

ASSOCIATED WITH THE 2007 ARIZONA BONDS. WE ADD CAPITALIZED INTEREST TO THE COST OF QUALIFIED ASSETS AND AMORTIZE IT OVER THE ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES OF THE ASSETS. THE REMAINING INTEREST ASSOCIATED WITH THE 2007 ARIZONA BONDS IS RECORDED AS INTEREST

EXPENSE IN INTEREST AND OTHER, NET.

ASSETS MEASURED AND RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE ON A NON-RECURRING BASIS

OUR NON-MARKETABLE EQUITY INVESTMENTS AND NON-FINANCIAL ASSETS, SUCH AS INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT, ARE RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE ONLY IF AN

IMPAIRMENT CHARGE IS RECOGNIZED. DURING 2011, WE RECOGNIZED $62 MILLION OF IMPAIRMENT CHARGES ON NON-MARKETABLE EQUITY INVESTMENTS HELD AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2011 ($121 MILLION OF IMPAIRMENT CHARGES DURING 2010 FOR NON-MARKETABLE EQUITY

INVESTMENTS HELD AS OF DECEMBER 25, 2010 AND $187 MILLION OF IMPAIRMENT CHARGES DURING 2009 FOR NON-MARKETABLE EQUITY INVESTMENTS HELD AS OF DECEMBER 26, 2009). THE FAIR VALUE OF THE NON-MARKETABLE EQUITY INVESTMENTS AT THE TIME OF

IMPAIRMENT WAS $69 MILLION DURING THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2011 ($128 MILLION DURING THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 25, 2010 AND $211 MILLION DURING THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 26, 2009). ALL OF THESE ASSETS WERE CATEGORIZED AS LEVEL 3 IN THE

FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY.

A PORTION OF OUR NON-MARKETABLE EQUITY INVESTMENTS WAS MEASURED AND RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE DUE TO EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES THAT

SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACTED THE FAIR VALUE OF THOSE INVESTMENTS, RESULTING IN OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENT CHARGES. WE CLASSIFIED THESE MEASUREMENTS AS LEVEL 3, AS WE USED UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS TO THE VALUATION METHODOLOGIES THAT WERE SIGNIFICANT TO THE

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS, AND THE VALUATIONS REQUIRED MANAGEMENT JUDGMENT DUE TO THE ABSENCE OF QUOTED MARKET PRICES. WE DETERMINE THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR NON-MARKETABLE EQUITY INVESTMENTS USING THE MARKET AND INCOME APPROACHES. THE MARKET APPROACH

INCLUDES THE USE OF FINANCIAL METRICS AND RATIOS OF COMPARABLE PUBLIC COMPANIES. THE SELECTION OF COMPARABLE COMPANIES REQUIRES MANAGEMENT JUDGMENT AND IS BASED ON A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING COMPARABLE COMPANIES SIZES, GROWTH RATES,

INDUSTRIES, DEVELOPMENT STAGES, AND OTHER RELEVANT FACTORS. THE INCOME APPROACH INCLUDES THE USE OF A DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW MODEL, WHICH REQUIRES THE FOLLOWING SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES FOR THE INVESTEE: REVENUE, COSTS, AND DISCOUNT RATES BASED ON THE

RISK PROFILE OF COMPARABLE COMPANIES. ESTIMATES OF REVENUES AND COSTS ARE DEVELOPED USING AVAILABLE MARKET, HISTORICAL, AND FORECAST DATA. THE VALUATION OF THESE NON-MARKETABLE EQUITY INVESTMENTS ALSO TAKES INTO ACCOUNT VARIABLES SUCH AS CONDITIONS

REFLECTED IN THE CAPITAL MARKETS, RECENT FINANCING ACTIVITIES BY THE INVESTEES, THE INVESTEES CAPITAL STRUCTURE, THE TERMS OF THE INVESTEES ISSUED INTERESTS, AND THE LACK OF MARKETABILITY OF THE INVESTMENTS.

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2011 AND DECEMBER 25, 2010, THE UNREALIZED LOSS POSITION OF OUR NON-MARKETABLE EQUITY

INVESTMENTS WAS NOT SIGNIFICANT.

OUR MARKETABLE EQUITY METHOD INVESTMENTS ARE PRIMARILY MADE UP OF OUR OWNERSHIP INTEREST IN SMART TECHNOLOGIES, INC.

THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR OWNERSHIP INTEREST IN OUR MARKETABLE EQUITY METHOD INVESTMENTS WAS BASED ON THE QUOTED CLOSING STOCK PRICES AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2011 AND DECEMBER 25, 2010.

THE CARRYING AMOUNT AND FAIR VALUE OF LOANS RECEIVABLE EXCLUDE LOANS MEASURED AND RECORDED AT A FAIR VALUE OF $748 MILLION AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2011 ($642 MILLION AS OF DECEMBER 25, 2010). THE CARRYING

AMOUNT AND FAIR VALUE OF LONG-TERM DEBT EXCLUDE LONG-TERM DEBT MEASURED AND RECORDED AT A FAIR VALUE OF $131 MILLION AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2011 ($128 MILLION AS OF DECEMBER 25, 2010). SHORT-TERM DEBT INCLUDES OUR COMMERCIAL PAPER OUTSTANDING

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2011, AND THE CARRYING AMOUNT AND FAIR VALUE EXCLUDE DRAFTS PAYABLE.

THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR LOANS RECEIVABLE IS DETERMINED USING

A DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW MODEL, WITH ALL SIGNIFICANT INPUTS DERIVED FROM OR CORROBORATED WITH OBSERVABLE MARKET DATA. THE CREDIT QUALITY OF OUR LOANS RECEIVABLE REMAINS HIGH, WITH CREDIT RATINGS OF BBB+/BAA1 OR BETTER AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2011. THE

FAIR VALUE OF OUR LONG-TERM DEBT IS DETERMINED USING THIRD-PARTY MARKET PRICES AND DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW MODELS THAT TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION VARIABLES SUCH AS CREDIT-RATING CHANGES AND INTEREST RATE CHANGES.

THE NVIDIA CORPORATION CROSS-LICENSE AGREEMENT LIABILITY IN THE PRECEDING TABLE WAS INCURRED AS A RESULT OF ENTERING INTO A LONG-TERM PATENT CROSS-LICENSE

AGREEMENT WITH NVIDIA IN JANUARY 2011. WE AGREED TO MAKE PAYMENTS TO NVIDIA OVER SIX YEARS. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ON THE PAYMENT TERMS AND

RECOGNITION OF LICENSED TECHNOLOGY INTANGIBLE ASSETS, SEE NOTE 17: IDENTIFIED INTANGIBLE ASSETS. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2011, THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF THE LIABILITY ARISING FROM THE

AGREEMENT WAS CLASSIFIED WITHIN OTHER ACCRUED LIABILITIES AND OTHER LONG-TERM LIABILITIES, AS APPLICABLE. THE FAIR VALUE IS DETERMINED USING A DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW MODEL, WITH ALL SIGNIFICANT INPUTS DERIVED FROM OR CORROBORATED WITH OBSERVABLE

MARKET DATA.

NET LOSSES ON MARKETABLE EQUITY SECURITIES CLASSIFIED AS TRADING ASSETS STILL HELD AT THE REPORTING DATE, EXCLUDING THE IMPACTS OF THE RELATED

DERIVATIVES, WERE $14 MILLION IN 2010.

IN 2010, WE SOLD OUR OWNERSHIP IN NUMONYX B.V. TO MICRON TECHNOLOGY, INC. THE MICRON COMMON STOCK THAT WE

RECEIVED IN THE TRANSACTION WAS CLASSIFIED AS MARKETABLE EQUITY SECURITIES WITHIN TRADING ASSETS. DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2011, WE SOLD OUR REMAINING SHARES IN MICRON.

WE SOLD AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE INVESTMENTS FOR PROCEEDS OF $9.1 BILLION IN 2011 ($475 MILLION IN 2010 AND

$192 MILLION IN 2009). SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE PROCEEDS IN 2011 WERE FROM DEBT INVESTMENTS THAT WERE PRIMARILY USED TO FUND OUR ACQUISITION OF MCAFEE. THE GROSS REALIZED GAINS ON SALES OF AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE INVESTMENTS WERE $268 MILLION

IN 2011 ($160 MILLION IN 2010 AND $43 MILLION IN 2009) AND WERE PRIMARILY RELATED TO OUR SALES OF MARKETABLE EQUITY SECURITIES. GAINS ON THIRD-PARTY MERGER TRANSACTIONS DURING 2011 WERE INSIGNIFICANT (INSIGNIFICANT IN 2010 AND $56 MILLION

IN 2009).

IMPAIRMENT CHARGES RECOGNIZED ON AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE INVESTMENTS WERE $73 MILLION IN 2011 (INSIGNIFICANT IN 2010 AND 2009). GROSS REALIZED

LOSSES RECOGNIZED ON AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE INVESTMENTS WERE INSIGNIFICANT IN 2011 ($13 MILLION IN 2010 AND $64 MILLION IN 2009). WE HAD PREVIOUSLY RECOGNIZED OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENTS TOTALING $34 MILLION DURING 2008 AND 2009 ON THE INVESTMENTS

THAT WERE SOLD IN 2009.

NOTE 8: DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

OUR PRIMARY OBJECTIVE FOR HOLDING DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS IS TO MANAGE CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE RISK AND INTEREST RATE RISK, AND, TO A

LESSER EXTENT, EQUITY MARKET RISK AND COMMODITY PRICE RISK. WE CURRENTLY DO NOT HOLD DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS FOR THE PURPOSE OF MANAGING CREDIT RISK SINCE WE LIMIT THE AMOUNT OF CREDIT EXPOSURE TO ANY ONE COUNTERPARTY AND GENERALLY ENTER INTO

DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS WITH HIGH-CREDIT-QUALITY COUNTERPARTIES.

CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE RISK

WE ARE EXPOSED TO CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE RISK AND GENERALLY HEDGE OUR EXPOSURES WITH CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS, CURRENCY INTEREST RATE SWAPS, OR CURRENCY OPTIONS. SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR REVENUE IS TRANSACTED IN

U.S. DOLLARS. HOWEVER, A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF OUR OPERATING EXPENDITURES AND CAPITAL PURCHASES ARE INCURRED IN OR EXPOSED TO OTHER CURRENCIES, PRIMARILY THE JAPANESE YEN, THE EURO, THE ISRAELI SHEKEL, AND THE CHINESE YUAN. WE HAVE ESTABLISHED

BALANCE SHEET AND FORECASTED TRANSACTION CURRENCY RISK MANAGEMENT PROGRAMS TO PROTECT AGAINST FLUCTUATIONS IN FAIR VALUE AND THE VOLATILITY OF THE FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY EQUIVALENT OF FUTURE CASH FLOWS CAUSED BY CHANGES IN EXCHANGE RATES. OUR

NON-U.S.-DOLLAR-DENOMINATED INVESTMENTS IN DEBT INSTRUMENTS AND LOANS RECEIVABLE ARE GENERALLY HEDGED WITH OFFSETTING CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS OR CURRENCY INTEREST RATE SWAPS. THESE PROGRAMS REDUCE, BUT DO NOT ENTIRELY ELIMINATE, THE IMPACT OF

CURRENCY EXCHANGE MOVEMENTS.

OUR CURRENCY RISK MANAGEMENT PROGRAMS INCLUDE.



CURRENCY DERIVATIVES WITH CASH FLOW HEDGE ACCOUNTING DESIGNATION

THAT UTILIZE CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS AND CURRENCY OPTIONS TO HEDGE EXPOSURES TO THE

VARIABILITY IN THE U.S.-DOLLAR EQUIVALENT OF ANTICIPATED NON-U.S.-DOLLAR-DENOMINATED CASH FLOWS. THESE INSTRUMENTS GENERALLY MATURE WITHIN 12 MONTHS. FOR THESE DERIVATIVES, WE REPORT THE AFTER-TAX GAIN OR LOSS FROM THE EFFECTIVE PORTION OF THE

HEDGE AS A COMPONENT OF ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS) AND RECLASSIFY IT INTO EARNINGS IN THE SAME PERIOD OR PERIODS IN WHICH THE HEDGED TRANSACTION AFFECTS EARNINGS, AND IN THE SAME LINE ITEM ON THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME

AS THE IMPACT OF THE HEDGED TRANSACTION.



CURRENCY DERIVATIVES WITHOUT HEDGE ACCOUNTING DESIGNATION

THAT UTILIZE CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS OR CURRENCY INTEREST RATE SWAPS TO ECONOMICALLY HEDGE

THE FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY EQUIVALENT CASH FLOWS OF RECOGNIZED MONETARY ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, NON-U.S.-DOLLAR-DENOMINATED DEBT INSTRUMENTS CLASSIFIED AS TRADING ASSETS, AND HEDGES OF NON-U.S.-DOLLAR-DENOMINATED LOANS RECEIVABLE RECOGNIZED AT FAIR

VALUE. THE MAJORITY OF THESE INSTRUMENTS MATURE WITHIN 12 MONTHS. CHANGES IN THE FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY EQUIVALENT CASH FLOWS OF THE UNDERLYING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE APPROXIMATELY OFFSET BY THE CHANGES IN FAIR VALUES OF THE RELATED DERIVATIVES. WE

RECORD NET GAINS OR LOSSES IN THE LINE ITEM ON THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME MOST CLOSELY ASSOCIATED WITH THE RELATED EXPOSURES, PRIMARILY IN INTEREST AND OTHER, NET, EXCEPT FOR EQUITY-RELATED GAINS OR LOSSES, WHICH WE PRIMARILY RECORD IN

GAINS (LOSSES) ON EQUITY INVESTMENTS, NET.

INTEREST RATE RISK

OUR PRIMARY OBJECTIVE FOR HOLDING INVESTMENTS IN DEBT INSTRUMENTS IS TO PRESERVE PRINCIPAL WHILE MAXIMIZING YIELDS. WE GENERALLY SWAP THE RETURNS ON OUR INVESTMENTS IN FIXED-RATE DEBT INSTRUMENTS WITH REMAINING

MATURITIES LONGER THAN SIX MONTHS INTO U.S.-DOLLAR THREE-MONTH LIBOR-BASED RETURNS, UNLESS MANAGEMENT SPECIFICALLY APPROVES OTHERWISE. THESE SWAPS ARE SETTLED AT VARIOUS INTEREST PAYMENT TIMES INVOLVING CASH PAYMENTS AT EACH INTEREST AND PRINCIPAL

PAYMENT DATE, WITH THE MAJORITY OF THE CONTRACTS HAVING QUARTERLY PAYMENTS.

OUR INTEREST RATE RISK MANAGEMENT PROGRAMS INCLUDE.



INTEREST RATE DERIVATIVES WITH CASH FLOW HEDGE ACCOUNTING DESIGNATION

THAT UTILIZE INTEREST RATE SWAP AGREEMENTS TO MODIFY THE INTEREST CHARACTERISTICS OF

DEBT INSTRUMENTS. FOR THESE DERIVATIVES, WE REPORT THE AFTER-TAX GAIN OR LOSS FROM THE EFFECTIVE PORTION OF THE HEDGE AS A COMPONENT OF ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS) AND RECLASSIFY IT INTO EARNINGS IN THE SAME PERIOD OR PERIODS IN

WHICH THE HEDGED TRANSACTION AFFECTS EARNINGS, AND IN THE SAME LINE ITEM ON THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME AS THE IMPACT OF THE HEDGED TRANSACTION.



INTEREST RATE DERIVATIVES WITHOUT HEDGE ACCOUNTING DESIGNATION

THAT UTILIZE INTEREST RATE SWAPS AND CURRENCY INTEREST RATE SWAPS IN ECONOMIC HEDGING

TRANSACTIONS, INCLUDING HEDGES OF NON-U.S.-DOLLAR-DENOMINATED DEBT INSTRUMENTS CLASSIFIED AS TRADING ASSETS AND HEDGES OF NON-U.S.-DOLLAR-DENOMINATED LOANS RECEIVABLE RECOGNIZED AT FAIR VALUE. FLOATING INTEREST RATES ON THE SWAPS ARE RESET ON A

QUARTERLY BASIS. CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE OF THE DEBT INSTRUMENTS CLASSIFIED AS TRADING ASSETS AND HEDGES OF LOANS RECEIVABLE RECOGNIZED AT FAIR VALUE ARE GENERALLY OFFSET BY CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE OF THE RELATED DERIVATIVES, BOTH OF WHICH ARE RECORDED

IN INTEREST AND OTHER, NET.

EQUITY MARKET RISK

OUR MARKETABLE INVESTMENTS INCLUDE MARKETABLE EQUITY SECURITIES AND EQUITY DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS. TO THE EXTENT THAT OUR MARKETABLE EQUITY SECURITIES HAVE

STRATEGIC VALUE, WE TYPICALLY DO NOT ATTEMPT TO REDUCE OR ELIMINATE OUR EQUITY MARKET EXPOSURE THROUGH HEDGING ACTIVITIES. WE MAY ENTER INTO TRANSACTIONS TO REDUCE OR ELIMINATE THE EQUITY MARKET RISKS FOR OUR INVESTMENTS IN STRATEGIC EQUITY

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS. FOR SECURITIES THAT WE NO LONGER CONSIDER STRATEGIC, WE EVALUATE LEGAL, MARKET, AND ECONOMIC FACTORS IN OUR DECISION ON THE TIMING OF DISPOSAL AND WHETHER IT IS POSSIBLE AND APPROPRIATE TO HEDGE THE EQUITY MARKET RISK. OUR

EQUITY MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT PROGRAM INCLUDES EQUITY DERIVATIVES WITHOUT HEDGE ACCOUNTING DESIGNATION THAT UTILIZE WARRANTS, EQUITY OPTIONS, OR OTHER EQUITY DERIVATIVES. WE RECOGNIZE CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF SUCH DERIVATIVES IN GAINS (LOSSES)

ON EQUITY INVESTMENTS, NET.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

WE ALSO UTILIZE TOTAL RETURN SWAPS TO OFFSET CHANGES IN LIABILITIES RELATED TO THE EQUITY MARKET RISKS OF CERTAIN

DEFERRED COMPENSATION ARRANGEMENTS. GAINS AND LOSSES FROM CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE OF THESE TOTAL RETURN SWAPS ARE GENERALLY OFFSET BY THE GAINS AND LOSSES ON THE RELATED LIABILITIES, WHICH ARE BOTH RECORDED IN COST OF SALES AND OPERATING EXPENSES. THE

DEFERRED COMPENSATION LIABILITIES WERE $700 MILLION AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2011 ($646 MILLION AS OF DECEMBER 25, 2010) AND ARE INCLUDED IN OTHER ACCRUED LIABILITIES.

IN 2010, WE SOLD OUR OWNERSHIP INTEREST IN NUMONYX TO MICRON FOR CONSIDERATION CONSISTING OF SHARES OF MICRON. WE ALSO ENTERED INTO EQUITY OPTION TRANSACTIONS THAT ECONOMICALLY HEDGED A PORTION OF THE OWNERSHIP

INTEREST IN MICRON THAT WE ACQUIRED. IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2011, WE SOLD OUR REMAINING OWNERSHIP INTEREST IN MICRON AND THE RELATED EQUITY OPTIONS MATURED.

COMMODITY PRICE RISK

WE OPERATE FACILITIES THAT CONSUME COMMODITIES AND HAVE

ESTABLISHED FORECASTED TRANSACTION RISK MANAGEMENT PROGRAMS TO PROTECT AGAINST FLUCTUATIONS IN FAIR VALUE AND THE VOLATILITY OF FUTURE CASH FLOWS CAUSED BY CHANGES IN COMMODITY PRICES, SUCH AS THOSE FOR NATURAL GAS. THESE PROGRAMS REDUCE, BUT DO NOT

ALWAYS ENTIRELY ELIMINATE, THE IMPACT OF COMMODITY PRICE MOVEMENTS.

OUR COMMODITY PRICE RISK MANAGEMENT PROGRAM INCLUDES COMMODITY DERIVATIVES WITH

CASH FLOW HEDGE ACCOUNTING DESIGNATION THAT UTILIZE COMMODITY SWAP CONTRACTS TO HEDGE FUTURE CASH FLOW EXPOSURES TO THE VARIABILITY IN COMMODITY PRICES. THESE INSTRUMENTS GENERALLY MATURE WITHIN 12 MONTHS. FOR THESE DERIVATIVES, WE REPORT THE

AFTER-TAX GAIN (LOSS) FROM THE EFFECTIVE PORTION OF THE HEDGE AS A COMPONENT OF ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS) AND RECLASSIFY IT INTO EARNINGS IN THE SAME PERIOD OR PERIODS IN WHICH THE HEDGED TRANSACTION AFFECTS EARNINGS, AND IN THE

NOTE 9: CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS THAT POTENTIALLY SUBJECT US TO CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK CONSIST PRINCIPALLY OF INVESTMENTS IN DEBT INSTRUMENTS,

DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, LOANS RECEIVABLE, AND TRADE RECEIVABLES. WE ENTER INTO MASTER NETTING ARRANGEMENTS WITH COUNTERPARTIES WHEN POSSIBLE TO MITIGATE CREDIT RISK IN DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS. A MASTER NETTING ARRANGEMENT MAY ALLOW

COUNTERPARTIES TO NET SETTLE AMOUNTS OWED TO EACH OTHER AS A RESULT OF MULTIPLE, SEPARATE DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS. FOR PRESENTATION ON OUR CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS, WE DO NOT OFFSET FAIR VALUE AMOUNTS RECOGNIZED FOR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS UNDER

MASTER NETTING ARRANGEMENTS.

WE GENERALLY PLACE INVESTMENTS WITH HIGH-CREDIT-QUALITY COUNTERPARTIES AND, BY POLICY, LIMIT THE AMOUNT OF CREDIT EXPOSURE

TO ANY ONE COUNTERPARTY BASED ON OUR ANALYSIS OF THAT COUNTERPARTYS RELATIVE CREDIT STANDING. SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR INVESTMENTS IN DEBT INSTRUMENTS ARE WITH A/A2 OR BETTER RATED ISSUERS, AND A MAJORITY OF THE ISSUERS ARE RATED AA-/AA3 OR

BETTER. OUR INVESTMENT POLICY REQUIRES SUBSTANTIALLY ALL INVESTMENTS WITH ORIGINAL MATURITIES AT THE TIME OF INVESTMENT OF UP TO SIX MONTHS TO BE RATED AT LEAST A-2/P-2 BY STANDARD & POORS/MOODYS, AND SPECIFIES A HIGHER MINIMUM

RATING FOR INVESTMENTS WITH LONGER MATURITIES. FOR INSTANCE, INVESTMENTS WITH MATURITIES OF GREATER THAN THREE YEARS REQUIRE A MINIMUM RATING OF AA-/AA3 AT THE TIME OF INVESTMENT. GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS IMPOSED ON INVESTMENT ALTERNATIVES OF OUR

NON-U.S. SUBSIDIARIES, OR THE ABSENCE OF A RATED COUNTERPARTIES IN CERTAIN COUNTRIES, RESULT IN SOME MINOR EXCEPTIONS. CREDIT-RATING CRITERIA FOR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS ARE SIMILAR TO THOSE FOR OTHER INVESTMENTS. DUE TO MASTER NETTING

ARRANGEMENTS, THE AMOUNTS SUBJECT TO CREDIT RISK RELATED TO

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS ARE GENERALLY LIMITED TO THE AMOUNTS, IF ANY, BY WHICH THE COUNTERPARTYS OBLIGATIONS EXCEED OUR OBLIGATIONS WITH THAT COUNTERPARTY. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2011, THE

TOTAL CREDIT EXPOSURE TO ANY SINGLE COUNTERPARTY, EXCLUDING U.S. TREASURY SECURITIES, DID NOT EXCEED $750 MILLION. WE OBTAIN AND SECURE AVAILABLE COLLATERAL FROM COUNTERPARTIES AGAINST OBLIGATIONS, INCLUDING SECURITIES LENDING TRANSACTIONS,

WHEN WE DEEM IT APPROPRIATE.

A SUBSTANTIAL MAJORITY OF OUR TRADE RECEIVABLES ARE DERIVED FROM SALES TO ORIGINAL EQUIPMENT MANUFACTURERS AND ORIGINAL

DESIGN MANUFACTURERS. WE ALSO HAVE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE DERIVED FROM SALES TO INDUSTRIAL AND RETAIL DISTRIBUTORS. OUR TWO LARGEST CUSTOMERS ACCOUNTED FOR 34% OF NET REVENUE FOR 2011 AND 38% OF NET REVENUE FOR 2010 AND 2009. ADDITIONALLY, THESE TWO

LARGEST CUSTOMERS ACCOUNTED FOR 32% OF OUR ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2011 AND 44% OF OUR ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AS OF DECEMBER 25, 2010. WE BELIEVE THAT THE RECEIVABLE BALANCES FROM THESE LARGEST CUSTOMERS DO NOT REPRESENT A

SIGNIFICANT CREDIT RISK BASED ON CASH FLOW FORECASTS, BALANCE SHEET ANALYSIS, AND PAST COLLECTION EXPERIENCE.

WE HAVE ADOPTED CREDIT POLICIES AND

STANDARDS INTENDED TO ACCOMMODATE INDUSTRY GROWTH AND INHERENT RISK. WE BELIEVE THAT CREDIT RISKS ARE MODERATED BY THE FINANCIAL STABILITY OF OUR MAJOR CUSTOMERS. WE ASSESS CREDIT RISK THROUGH QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE ANALYSIS, AND FROM THIS

ANALYSIS, WE ESTABLISH CREDIT LIMITS AND DETERMINE WHETHER WE WILL SEEK TO USE ONE OR MORE CREDIT SUPPORT DEVICES, SUCH AS OBTAINING A THIRD-PARTY GUARANTEE OR STANDBY LETTER OF CREDIT, OR OBTAINING CREDIT INSURANCE.

IMFT/IMFS

MICRON AND INTEL FORMED IM FLASH TECHNOLOGIES, LLC (IMFT) AND IM FLASH SINGAPORE, LLP (IMFS) TO MANUFACTURE NAND FLASH MEMORY PRODUCTS FOR MICRON AND INTEL. THE CARRYING VALUE OF OUR INVESTMENT IN IMFT/IMFS WAS

$1.3 BILLION AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2011 ($1.5 BILLION AS OF DECEMBER 25, 2010) AND IS CLASSIFIED WITHIN OTHER LONG-TERM ASSETS. IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2011, WE MADE AN ADDITIONAL INVESTMENT OF $131 MILLION IN IMFS. THE IMFS FABRICATION

FACILITY BEGAN INITIAL PRODUCTION IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2011. IMFT AND IMFS ARE EACH GOVERNED BY A BOARD OF MANAGERS, WITH MICRON AND INTEL INITIALLY APPOINTING AN EQUAL NUMBER OF MANAGERS TO EACH OF THE BOARDS. THE NUMBER OF MANAGERS APPOINTED

BY EACH PARTY ADJUSTS DEPENDING ON THE PARTIES OWNERSHIP INTERESTS. AS A RESULT OF OUR OVERALL NET REDUCTION OF OUR OWNERSHIP INTEREST IN IMFS, MICRON NOW APPOINTS THE MAJORITY OF THE MANAGERS ON THE IMFS BOARD. THROUGH OUR REMAINING MANAGERS

ON THE IMFS BOARD, WE CONTINUE TO HAVE SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE OVER THE OPERATIONS OF IMFS, AND THEREFORE CONTINUE TO ACCOUNT FOR OUR INTERESTS USING THE EQUITY METHOD OF ACCOUNTING. THESE VENTURES ARE EXPECTED TO OPERATE UNTIL 2016 BUT ARE SUBJECT TO

EARLIER TERMINATION UNDER CERTAIN TERMS AND CONDITIONS.

THESE JOINT VENTURES ARE VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES. ALL COSTS OF THE JOINT VENTURES WILL BE PASSED ON TO MICRON AND

INTEL THROUGH OUR PURCHASE AGREEMENTS. IMFT AND IMFS ARE DEPENDENT UPON MICRON AND INTEL FOR ANY ADDITIONAL CASH REQUIREMENTS. OUR KNOWN MAXIMUM EXPOSURE TO LOSS APPROXIMATED THE CARRYING VALUE OF OUR INVESTMENT BALANCE IN IMFT/IMFS AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2011. EXCEPT FOR THE AMOUNT DUE TO IMFT/IMFS FOR PRODUCT PURCHASES AND SERVICES, WE DID NOT HAVE ANY ADDITIONAL LIABILITIES RECOGNIZED ON OUR CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS IN CONNECTION WITH OUR INTERESTS IN THESE JOINT VENTURES AS

OF DECEMBER 31, 2011. FUTURE CASH CALLS COULD INCREASE OUR INVESTMENT BALANCE AND THE RELATED EXPOSURE TO LOSS. POTENTIAL FUTURE LOSSES COULD BE HIGHER THAN THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF OUR INVESTMENT, AS INTEL AND MICRON ARE LIABLE FOR OTHER FUTURE

OPERATING COSTS OR OBLIGATIONS OF IMFT/IMFS. FINALLY, AS WE ARE CURRENTLY COMMITTED TO PURCHASING 49% OF IMFTS AND 22% OF IMFSS PRODUCTION OUTPUT AND PRODUCTION-RELATED SERVICES, WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO PURCHASE PRODUCTS AT A COST IN

EXCESS OF REALIZABLE VALUE. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2011, OUR CONTRACTUAL COMMITMENT TO PURCHASE PRODUCT OUTPUT AND FUND PRODUCTION-RELATED SERVICES FROM IMFS ADJUSTS TO CHANGES IN OUR OWNERSHIP PERCENTAGE ON AN EIGHT-MONTH LAG.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

OUR PORTION OF IMFT/IMFS COSTS, PRIMARILY RELATED TO PRODUCT PURCHASES AND PRODUCTION-RELATED SERVICES, WAS

APPROXIMATELY $985 MILLION DURING 2011 (APPROXIMATELY $795 MILLION DURING 2010 AND APPROXIMATELY $755 MILLION DURING 2009). THE AMOUNT DUE TO IMFT/IMFS FOR PRODUCT PURCHASES AND SERVICES PROVIDED WAS APPROXIMATELY $125 MILLION AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2011 (APPROXIMATELY $105 MILLION AS OF DECEMBER 25, 2010). DURING 2011, $263 MILLION WAS RETURNED TO INTEL BY IMFT/IMFS, WHICH IS REFLECTED AS A RETURN OF EQUITY METHOD INVESTMENT WITHIN INVESTING ACTIVITIES ON THE

CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS ($199 MILLION DURING 2010 AND $449 MILLION DURING 2009). IN 2010, IMFT INCREASED ITS CAPITAL EXPENDITURES COMPARED TO 2009. THE CASH USED FOR THOSE CAPITAL EXPENDITURES REDUCED THE AMOUNT OF CASH PROVIDED BY

IMFT TO US AS A RETURN OF EQUITY METHOD INVESTMENT IN 2010. COSTS THAT INTEL AND MICRON HAVE INCURRED FOR PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT AND PROCESS DEVELOPMENT RELATED TO IMFT/IMFS ARE GENERALLY SPLIT EVENLY BETWEEN INTEL AND MICRON AND ARE GENERALLY

CLASSIFIED IN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT.

UNDER THE ACCOUNTING STANDARDS FOR CONSOLIDATING VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES, THE CONSOLIDATING INVESTOR IS THE

ENTITY WITH THE POWER TO DIRECT THE ACTIVITIES OF THE VENTURE THAT MOST SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT THE VENTURES ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE AND WITH THE OBLIGATION TO ABSORB LOSSES OR THE RIGHT TO RECEIVE BENEFITS FROM THE VENTURE THAT COULD POTENTIALLY BE

SIGNIFICANT TO THE VENTURE. WE HAVE DETERMINED THAT WE DO NOT HAVE BOTH OF THESE CHARACTERISTICS AND, THEREFORE, WE ACCOUNT FOR OUR INTERESTS USING THE EQUITY METHOD OF ACCOUNTING.

INTEL-GE CARE INNOVATIONS, LLC

IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2011, INTEL AND GENERAL ELECTRIC

COMPANY (GE) FORMED AN EQUALLY OWNED JOINT VENTURE, INTEL-GE CARE INNOVATIONS, LLC (CARE INNOVATIONS), IN THE HEALTHCARE INDUSTRY THAT FOCUSES ON INDEPENDENT LIVING AND DELIVERY OF HEALTH-RELATED SERVICES VIA TELECOMMUNICATIONS. THE COMPANY WAS

FORMED BY COMBINING ASSETS OF GE HEALTHCARES HOME HEALTH DIVISION AND INTELS DIGITAL HEALTH GROUP. AS A RESULT OF THE FORMATION OF CARE INNOVATIONS, WE RECOGNIZED A GAIN OF $164 MILLION IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2011 THAT IS RECORDED IN

INTEREST AND OTHER, NET.

CARE INNOVATIONS IS DEPENDENT UPON INTEL AND GE FOR ANY ADDITIONAL CASH REQUIREMENTS AND, THEREFORE, IS A VARIABLE INTEREST

ENTITY. OUR KNOWN MAXIMUM EXPOSURE TO LOSS APPROXIMATED THE CARRYING VALUE OF OUR INVESTMENT BALANCE IN CARE INNOVATIONS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2011. IN ADDITION TO THE POTENTIAL LOSS OF OUR EXISTING INVESTMENT, OUR ACTUAL LOSSES COULD BE HIGHER,

AS WE ARE LIABLE TO CONTRIBUTE ADDITIONAL FUTURE FUNDING UP TO $38 MILLION IF CARE INNOVATIONS MEETS ESTABLISHED MILESTONES.

INTEL AND GE EQUALLY SHARE THE POWER TO DIRECT ALL OF CARE INNOVATIONS ACTIVITIES THAT MOST SIGNIFICANTLY

IMPACT ITS ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE. AS A RESULT, WE ACCOUNT FOR OUR INTERESTS IN CARE INNOVATIONS UNDER THE EQUITY METHOD OF ACCOUNTING.

TABLET MARKET SEGMENTS. DUE TO THE FORMATION OF THIS NEW OPERATING SEGMENT, GOODWILL WAS TRANSFERRED FROM OUR PC CLIENT GROUP TO OUR NETBOOK AND TABLET GROUP AS SHOWN IN THE PRECEDING TABLE. OUR NETBOOK AND TABLET GROUP IS INCLUDED IN THE OTHER

INTEL ARCHITECTURE OPERATING SEGMENTS CATEGORY IN THE PRECEDING TABLE.

DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2011, WE COMPLETED THE ACQUISITION OF MCAFEE. THE GOODWILL RECOGNIZED FROM THIS

ACQUISITION WAS ALLOCATED BETWEEN THE MCAFEE OPERATING SEGMENT AND THE PC CLIENT GROUP BASED ON THE RELATIVE EXPECTED FAIR VALUE PROVIDED BY THE ACQUISITION, WHICH REFLECTED THE ESTIMATED SYNERGISTIC VALUE GENERATED WITHIN THE PC CLIENT GROUP FROM

INCORPORATING MCAFEES SECURITY EXPERTISE, REPUTATION, AND CUSTOMER BASE. THE GOODWILL RECOGNIZED FROM OUR OTHER ACQUISITIONS DURING 2011 WAS ALLOCATED TO MCAFEE, THE SOFTWARE AND SERVICES GROUP, INTEL MOBILE COMMUNICATIONS, THE DATA CENTER

GROUP, THE ULTRA-MOBILITY GROUP, AND THE PC CLIENT GROUP. MCAFEE AND THE SOFTWARE AND SERVICES GROUP ARE INCLUDED IN THE SOFTWARE AND SERVICES OPERATING SEGMENTS CATEGORY IN THE PRECEDING TABLE, WHILE INTEL MOBILE COMMUNICATIONS AND THE

ULTRA-MOBILITY GROUP ARE INCLUDED IN THE OTHER INTEL ARCHITECTURE OPERATING SEGMENTS CATEGORY. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT OUR ACQUISITIONS DURING 2011, SEE NOTE 14: ACQUISITIONS.

AS A RESULT OF OUR ACQUISITION OF MCAFEE DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2011, WE RECORDED $3.6 BILLION OF IDENTIFIED

INTANGIBLE ASSETS. IN ADDITION, AS A RESULT OF OUR OTHER ACQUISITIONS DURING 2011, WE RECORDED $1.4 BILLION OF IDENTIFIED INTANGIBLE ASSETS, THE SUBSTANTIAL MAJORITY OF WHICH WAS FROM THE ACQUISITION OF THE WLS BUSINESS OF INFINEON. FOR FURTHER

INFORMATION ABOUT IDENTIFIED INTANGIBLE ASSETS RECORDED AS A RESULT OF ACQUISITIONS DURING 2011, SEE NOTE 14: ACQUISITIONS.

IN JANUARY 2011,

WE ENTERED INTO A LONG-TERM PATENT CROSS-LICENSE AGREEMENT WITH NVIDIA. UNDER THE AGREEMENT, WE RECEIVED A LICENSE TO ALL OF NVIDIAS PATENTS WITH A CAPTURE PERIOD THAT RUNS THROUGH MARCH 2017 WHILE NVIDIA PRODUCTS ARE LICENSED TO OUR PATENTS,

SUBJECT TO EXCLUSIONS FOR X86 PRODUCTS, CERTAIN CHIPSETS, AND CERTAIN FLASH MEMORY TECHNOLOGY PRODUCTS. THE AGREEMENT ALSO INCLUDED SETTLEMENT OF THE EXISTING LITIGATION BETWEEN THE COMPANIES AS WELL AS BROAD MUTUAL GENERAL RELEASES. WE AGREED TO

MAKE PAYMENTS TOTALING $1.5 BILLION TO NVIDIA OVER SIX YEARS ($300 MILLION IN EACH OF JANUARY 2011, 2012, AND 2013; AND $200 MILLION IN EACH OF JANUARY 2014, 2015, AND 2016), WHICH

RESULTED IN A LIABILITY TOTALING APPROXIMATELY $1.4 BILLION, ON A DISCOUNTED BASIS. IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2010, WE RECOGNIZED AN EXPENSE OF $100 MILLION RELATED TO THE LITIGATION SETTLEMENT.

IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2011, WE RECOGNIZED THE REMAINING AMOUNT OF $1.3 BILLION AS LICENSED TECHNOLOGY, WHICH WILL BE AMORTIZED INTO COST OF SALES OVER ITS ESTIMATED USEFUL LIFE OF 17 YEARS. THE INITIAL RECOGNITION OF THE INTANGIBLE ASSET AND

ASSOCIATED LIABILITY FOR FUTURE PAYMENTS TO NVIDIA IS TREATED AS A NON-CASH TRANSACTION AND, THEREFORE, HAS NO IMPACT ON OUR CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS. FUTURE PAYMENTS WILL BE TREATED AS CASH USED FOR FINANCING ACTIVITIES. AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2011, THE REMAINING LIABILITY OF $1.2 BILLION IS CLASSIFIED WITHIN OTHER ACCRUED LIABILITIES AND OTHER LONG-TERM LIABILITIES, BASED ON THE EXPECTED TIMING OF THE UNDERLYING PAYMENTS.

AS A RESULT OF OUR ACQUISITIONS IN 2010, WE RECORDED ACQUISITION-RELATED DEVELOPED TECHNOLOGY FOR $37 MILLION WITH LIVES OF FOUR YEARS, AND ADDITIONS TO

ACQUISITION-RELATED CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIPS OF $58 MILLION WITH A WEIGHTED AVERAGE LIFE OF SEVEN YEARS. IN ADDITION, WE ACQUIRED OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS FOR $104 MILLION IN 2010 THAT ARE NOT SUBJECT TO AMORTIZATION.

NOTE 20: CHIPSET DESIGN ISSUE

IN JANUARY 2011, AS PART OF OUR ONGOING QUALITY ASSURANCE PROCEDURES, WE IDENTIFIED A DESIGN ISSUE WITH THE INTEL

®

6 SERIES EXPRESS CHIPSET FAMILY (FORMERLY CODE NAMED COUGAR POINT). THE ISSUE AFFECTED CHIPSETS SOLD IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF

2010 AND JANUARY 2011. WE SUBSEQUENTLY IMPLEMENTED A SILICON FIX, AND BEGAN SHIPPING THE UPDATED VERSION OF THE AFFECTED CHIPSET IN FEBRUARY 2011. WE ESTIMATE THAT THE TOTAL COST TO REPAIR AND REPLACE AFFECTED MATERIALS AND SYSTEMS, LOCATED WITH

CUSTOMERS AND IN THE MARKET, WILL BE $733 MILLION. WE RECORDED A CHARGE OF $311 MILLION IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2010, WHICH COMPRISED $67 MILLION IN PRODUCT COSTS FOR THE AFFECTED CHIPSETS AND $244 MILLION TO ESTABLISH A PRODUCT ACCRUAL FOR THIS

ISSUE. WE RECOGNIZED A CHARGE OF $343 MILLION IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2011, PRIMARILY RELATED TO AN ADDITIONAL PRODUCT ACCRUAL FOR THE ESTIMATED COSTS TO REPAIR AND REPLACE AFFECTED MATERIALS AND SYSTEMS ASSOCIATED WITH PRODUCTS SOLD SUBSEQUENT TO

DECEMBER 25, 2010. IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2011, WE RECOGNIZED AN ADDITIONAL $79 MILLION CHARGE AS WE FINALIZED AGREEMENTS WITH CUSTOMERS FOR REIMBURSEMENT TO REPAIR AND REPLACE AFFECTED MATERIALS AND SYSTEMS. WE DO NOT EXPECT TO HAVE ANY

BOTH THE 2009 AND 2005 DEBENTURES HAVE A CONTINGENT INTEREST COMPONENT THAT REQUIRES US TO PAY INTEREST BASED ON

CERTAIN THRESHOLDS AND FOR CERTAIN EVENTS, COMMENCING ON AUGUST 1, 2019 FOR THE 2009 DEBENTURES. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2011, WE HAVE NOT MET ANY OF THE THRESHOLDS AND EVENTS RELATED TO THE 2005 DEBENTURES. THE FAIR VALUES OF THE RELATED

EMBEDDED DERIVATIVES WERE $10 MILLION AND ZERO AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2011 FOR THE 2009 AND 2005 DEBENTURES, RESPECTIVELY ($12 MILLION AND $19 MILLION AS OF DECEMBER 25, 2010 FOR THE 2009 AND 2005 DEBENTURES, RESPECTIVELY).

BOTH THE 2009 AND 2005 DEBENTURES ARE CONVERTIBLE, SUBJECT TO CERTAIN CONDITIONS, INTO SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK. HOLDERS CAN SURRENDER THE 2009 DEBENTURES FOR

CONVERSION IF THE CLOSING PRICE OF INTEL COMMON STOCK HAS BEEN AT LEAST 130% OF THE CONVERSION PRICE THEN IN EFFECT FOR AT LEAST 20 TRADING DAYS DURING THE 30 CONSECUTIVE TRADING-DAY PERIOD ENDING ON THE LAST TRADING DAY OF THE PRECEDING FISCAL

QUARTER. HOLDERS CAN SURRENDER THE 2005 DEBENTURES FOR CONVERSION AT ANY TIME. WE WILL SETTLE ANY CONVERSION OR REPURCHASE OF THE 2009 DEBENTURES IN CASH UP TO THE FACE VALUE, AND ANY AMOUNT IN EXCESS OF FACE VALUE WILL BE SETTLED IN CASH OR STOCK

AT OUR OPTION. HOWEVER, WE CAN SETTLE ANY CONVERSION OR REPURCHASE OF THE 2005 DEBENTURES IN CASH OR STOCK AT OUR OPTION. ON OR AFTER AUGUST 5, 2019, WE CAN REDEEM, FOR CASH, ALL OR PART OF THE 2009 DEBENTURES FOR THE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT,

PLUS ANY ACCRUED AND UNPAID INTEREST, IF THE CLOSING PRICE OF INTEL COMMON STOCK HAS BEEN AT LEAST 150% OF THE CONVERSION PRICE THEN IN EFFECT FOR AT LEAST 20 TRADING DAYS DURING ANY 30

CONSECUTIVE TRADING-DAY PERIOD PRIOR TO THE DATE ON WHICH WE PROVIDE NOTICE OF REDEMPTION. ON OR AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2012, WE CAN REDEEM, FOR CASH, ALL OR PART OF THE 2005 DEBENTURES FOR THE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT, PLUS ANY ACCRUED AND UNPAID

INTEREST, IF THE CLOSING PRICE OF INTEL COMMON STOCK HAS BEEN AT LEAST 130% OF THE CONVERSION PRICE THEN IN EFFECT FOR AT LEAST 20 TRADING DAYS DURING ANY 30 CONSECUTIVE TRADING-DAY PERIOD PRIOR TO THE DATE ON WHICH WE PROVIDE NOTICE OF REDEMPTION.

IF CERTAIN EVENTS OCCUR IN THE FUTURE, THE INDENTURES GOVERNING THE 2009 AND 2005 DEBENTURES PROVIDE THAT EACH HOLDER OF THE DEBENTURES CAN, FOR A PRE-DEFINED PERIOD OF TIME, REQUIRE US TO REPURCHASE THE HOLDERS DEBENTURES FOR THE PRINCIPAL

AMOUNT PLUS ANY ACCRUED AND UNPAID INTEREST. BOTH THE 2009 AND 2005 DEBENTURES ARE SUBORDINATED IN RIGHT OF PAYMENT TO ANY EXISTING AND FUTURE SENIOR DEBT AND TO THE OTHER LIABILITIES OF OUR SUBSIDIARIES. WE HAVE CONCLUDED THAT BOTH THE 2009 AND

2005 DEBENTURES ARE NOT CONVENTIONAL CONVERTIBLE DEBT INSTRUMENTS AND THAT THE EMBEDDED STOCK CONVERSION OPTIONS QUALIFY AS DERIVATIVES. IN ADDITION, WE HAVE CONCLUDED THAT THE EMBEDDED CONVERSION OPTIONS WOULD BE CLASSIFIED IN STOCKHOLDERS

ARIZONA BONDS

IN 2007, WE GUARANTEED REPAYMENT OF PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST ON BONDS ISSUED BY THE INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY OF THE CITY OF CHANDLER, ARIZONA, WHICH CONSTITUTE AN UNSECURED GENERAL OBLIGATION FOR INTEL. THE

AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF THE BONDS ISSUED IN DECEMBER 2007 IS $125 MILLION, AND THE BONDS BEAR INTEREST AT A FIXED RATE OF 5.3%. THE 2007 ARIZONA BONDS ARE SUBJECT TO MANDATORY TENDER, AT OUR OPTION, ON ANY INTEREST PAYMENT DATE BEGINNING

ON OR AFTER DECEMBER 1, 2012 UNTIL THEIR FINAL MATURITY ON DECEMBER 1, 2037. UPON SUCH TENDER, WE CAN RE-MARKET THE BONDS AS EITHER FIXED-RATE BONDS FOR A SPECIFIED PERIOD OR AS VARIABLE-RATE BONDS UNTIL THEIR FINAL MATURITY. WE ALSO

ENTERED INTO A TOTAL RETURN SWAP AGREEMENT THAT EFFECTIVELY CONVERTS THE FIXED-RATE OBLIGATION ON THE BONDS TO A FLOATING U.S.-DOLLAR LIBOR-BASED RATE. WE HAVE ELECTED TO ACCOUNT FOR THE 2007 ARIZONA BONDS AT FAIR VALUE. FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION, SEE

NOTE 22: RETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS

RETIREMENT CONTRIBUTION PLANS

WE PROVIDE TAX-QUALIFIED RETIREMENT CONTRIBUTION PLANS FOR THE BENEFIT OF ELIGIBLE EMPLOYEES, FORMER EMPLOYEES, AND RETIREES IN THE U.S. AND CERTAIN OTHER COUNTRIES. THE PLANS ARE DESIGNED TO PROVIDE EMPLOYEES WITH

AN ACCUMULATION OF FUNDS FOR RETIREMENT ON A TAX-DEFERRED BASIS. EMPLOYEES HIRED PRIOR TO JANUARY 1, 2011 ARE ELIGIBLE FOR THE U.S. INTEL RETIREMENT CONTRIBUTION PLAN, WHILE EMPLOYEES HIRED ON OR AFTER JANUARY 1, 2011 RECEIVE DISCRETIONARY

EMPLOYER CONTRIBUTIONS IN THE INTEL 401(K) SAVINGS PLAN. OUR CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER (CEO) DETERMINES THE ANNUAL DISCRETIONARY EMPLOYER CONTRIBUTION AMOUNTS FOR THE U.S. INTEL RETIREMENT CONTRIBUTION PLAN AND THE INTEL 401(K) SAVINGS PLAN UNDER

DELEGATION OF AUTHORITY FROM OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS, PURSUANT TO THE TERMS OF THE PLANS. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2011, 68% OF OUR U.S. INTEL RETIREMENT CONTRIBUTION PLAN ASSETS WERE INVESTED IN EQUITIES, 25% WERE INVESTED IN FIXED-INCOME

INSTRUMENTS, AND 7% WERE INVESTED IN REAL ASSETS. THESE ASSETS ARE MANAGED BY EXTERNAL INVESTMENT MANAGERS. THE DISCRETIONARY EMPLOYER CONTRIBUTIONS MADE TO THE INTEL 401(K) SAVINGS PLAN ARE PARTICIPANT DIRECTED.

FOR THE BENEFIT OF ELIGIBLE U.S. EMPLOYEES, WE ALSO PROVIDE A NON-TAX-QUALIFIED SUPPLEMENTAL DEFERRED COMPENSATION PLAN FOR CERTAIN HIGHLY COMPENSATED

EMPLOYEES. THIS PLAN IS DESIGNED TO PERMIT CERTAIN DISCRETIONARY EMPLOYER CONTRIBUTIONS AND TO PERMIT EMPLOYEE DEFERRAL OF A PORTION OF COMPENSATION IN ADDITION TO THEIR INTEL 401(K) SAVINGS PLAN DEFERRALS. THIS PLAN IS UNFUNDED.

WE EXPENSED $340 MILLION FOR THE QUALIFIED AND NON-QUALIFIED U.S. RETIREMENT CONTRIBUTION PLANS IN 2011 ($319

MILLION IN 2010 AND $260 MILLION IN 2009). IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2012, WE FUNDED $320 MILLION FOR THE 2011 CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE QUALIFIED U.S. RETIREMENT CONTRIBUTION PLANS.

PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS

U.S. PENSION

BENEFITS.

FOR EMPLOYEES HIRED PRIOR TO JANUARY 1, 2011, WE PROVIDE A TAX-QUALIFIED DEFINED-BENEFIT PENSION PLAN, THE U.S. INTEL MINIMUM PENSION PLAN, FOR THE BENEFIT OF ELIGIBLE EMPLOYEES, FORMER EMPLOYEES, AND RETIREES IN THE

U.S. THE U.S. INTEL MINIMUM PENSION PLAN BENEFIT IS DETERMINED BY A PARTICIPANTS YEARS OF SERVICE AND FINAL AVERAGE COMPENSATION (TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE PARTICIPANTS SOCIAL SECURITY WAGE BASE). THE PLAN GENERATES A MINIMUM PENSION

BENEFIT IF THE PARTICIPANTS U.S. INTEL MINIMUM PENSION PLAN BENEFIT EXCEEDS THE ANNUITIZED VALUE OF HIS OR HER U.S. INTEL RETIREMENT CONTRIBUTION PLAN BENEFIT. IF PARTICIPANT BALANCES IN THE U.S. INTEL RETIREMENT CONTRIBUTION PLAN DO NOT GROW

SUFFICIENTLY, THE PROJECTED BENEFIT OBLIGATION OF THE U.S. INTEL MINIMUM PENSION PLAN COULD INCREASE SIGNIFICANTLY.

NON-U.S. PENSION

BENEFITS.

WE ALSO PROVIDE DEFINED-BENEFIT PENSION PLANS IN CERTAIN OTHER COUNTRIES. CONSISTENT WITH THE REQUIREMENTS OF LOCAL LAW, WE DEPOSIT FUNDS FOR CERTAIN PLANS WITH INSURANCE COMPANIES, WITH THIRD-PARTY TRUSTEES, OR INTO

GOVERNMENT-MANAGED ACCOUNTS, AND/OR ACCRUE FOR THE UNFUNDED PORTION OF THE OBLIGATION.

U.S. POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL BENEFITS.

UPON

RETIREMENT, ELIGIBLE U.S. EMPLOYEES ARE CREDITED WITH A DEFINED DOLLAR AMOUNT, BASED ON YEARS OF SERVICE, INTO A U.S. SHELTERED EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT MEDICAL ACCOUNT (SERMA). IN 2010, WE APPROVED A PLAN AMENDMENT, EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2011,

TO EXPAND USE OF THESE CREDITS TO PAY ALL OR A PORTION OF THE COST TO PURCHASE COVERAGE IN THE RETIREES CHOICE OF MEDICAL PLAN. PRIOR TO 2011, THESE CREDITS COULD ONLY BE USED TO PAY ALL OR A PORTION OF THE COST TO PURCHASE COVERAGE IN AN

INTEL-SPONSORED MEDICAL PLAN. IF THE AVAILABLE CREDITS ARE NOT SUFFICIENT TO PAY THE ENTIRE COST OF THE COVERAGE, THE REMAINING COST IS THE RETIREES RESPONSIBILITY.

FUNDING POLICY.

OUR PRACTICE IS TO FUND THE VARIOUS PENSION PLANS AND THE U.S. POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL BENEFITS PLAN IN AMOUNTS SUFFICIENT TO MEET THE MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS OF U.S. FEDERAL LAWS

AND REGULATIONS OR APPLICABLE LOCAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS. ADDITIONAL FUNDING MAY BE PROVIDED AS DEEMED APPROPRIATE. DEPENDING ON THE DESIGN OF THE PLAN, LOCAL CUSTOMS, AND MARKET CIRCUMSTANCES, THE LIABILITIES OF A PLAN MAY EXCEED QUALIFIED PLAN

ASSETS.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

FOR THE U.S. PLANS, WE DEVELOPED THE DISCOUNT RATE BY CALCULATING THE BENEFIT PAYMENT STREAMS BY YEAR TO

DETERMINE WHEN BENEFIT PAYMENTS WILL BE DUE. WE THEN MATCHED THE BENEFIT PAYMENT STREAMS BY YEAR TO THE AA CORPORATE BOND RATES TO MATCH THE TIMING AND AMOUNT OF THE EXPECTED BENEFIT PAYMENTS AND DISCOUNTED BACK TO THE MEASUREMENT DATE TO DETERMINE

THE APPROPRIATE DISCOUNT RATE. FOR THE NON-U.S. PLANS, WE USED TWO APPROACHES TO DEVELOP THE DISCOUNT RATE. IN CERTAIN COUNTRIES, WE USED A MODEL CONSISTING OF A THEORETICAL BOND PORTFOLIO FOR WHICH THE TIMING AND AMOUNT OF CASH FLOWS

APPROXIMATED THE ESTIMATED BENEFIT PAYMENTS OF OUR PENSION PLANS. IN OTHER COUNTRIES, WE ANALYZED CURRENT MARKET LONG-TERM BOND RATES AND MATCHED THE BOND MATURITY WITH THE AVERAGE DURATION OF THE PENSION LIABILITIES. THE EXPECTED LONG-TERM RATE OF

RETURN ON PLAN

ASSETS ASSUMPTIONS TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION BOTH DURATION AND RISK OF THE INVESTMENT PORTFOLIOS, AND ARE DEVELOPED THROUGH CONSENSUS AND BUILDING-BLOCK METHODOLOGIES. THE CONSENSUS METHODOLOGY

INCLUDES UNADJUSTED ESTIMATES BY THE FUND MANAGER ON FUTURE MARKET EXPECTATIONS BY BROAD ASSET CLASSES AND GEOGRAPHY. THE BUILDING-BLOCK APPROACH DETERMINES THE RATES OF RETURN IMPLIED BY HISTORICAL RISK PREMIUMS ACROSS ASSET CLASSES. IN ADDITION,

WE ANALYZED RATES OF RETURN RELEVANT TO THE COUNTRY WHERE EACH PLAN IS IN EFFECT AND THE INVESTMENTS APPLICABLE TO THE PLAN, EXPECTATIONS OF FUTURE RETURNS, LOCAL ACTUARIAL PROJECTIONS, AND THE PROJECTED LONG-TERM RATES OF RETURN FROM EXTERNAL

INVESTMENT MANAGERS. THE EXPECTED LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS SHOWN FOR THE NON-U.S. PLAN ASSETS IS WEIGHTED TO REFLECT EACH COUNTRYS RELATIVE PORTION OF THE NON-U.S. PLAN ASSETS.

U.S. PENSION PLAN ASSETS

IN GENERAL, THE INVESTMENT STRATEGY FOR U.S. INTEL MINIMUM PENSION PLAN ASSETS IS TO MAXIMIZE RISK-ADJUSTED RETURNS, TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION THE INVESTMENT HORIZON AND EXPECTED VOLATILITY, TO ENSURE THAT

THERE ARE SUFFICIENT ASSETS AVAILABLE TO PAY PENSION BENEFITS AS THEY COME DUE. THE ALLOCATION TO EACH ASSET CLASS WILL FLUCTUATE WITH MARKET

CONDITIONS, SUCH AS VOLATILITY AND LIQUIDITY CONCERNS, AND WILL TYPICALLY BE REBALANCED WHEN OUTSIDE THE TARGET RANGES, WHICH ARE 80% TO 90% FOR FIXED-INCOME DEBT INSTRUMENT INVESTMENTS AND 10%

TO 20% FOR HEDGE FUND INVESTMENTS. THE EXPECTED LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN FOR THE U.S. INTEL MINIMUM PENSION PLAN ASSETS IS 5.0%.

THE GLOBAL BOND FUNDS TARGET ALLOCATION IS APPROXIMATELY 30% OF ASSETS IN GOVERNMENT AND HIGH-QUALITY CORPORATE

BONDS AND ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES TO MITIGATE RISKS RELATED TO DEFLATION, 15% IN GLOBAL INFLATION-INDEXED BONDS TO PROVIDE PROTECTION FROM INFLATION, AND ANOTHER 15% IN INTERNATIONAL GOVERNMENT AND CORPORATE BONDS. THE RESIDUAL 40% OF THE FUND IS

ALLOCATED TO OPPORTUNISTIC BOND INVESTMENTS, WHICH ARE USED TO ENHANCE RETURN AND PROVIDE DIVERSIFICATION. SUCH OPPORTUNISTIC BOND INVESTMENTS INCLUDE EMERGING MARKET DEBT INSTRUMENTS WITH UN-HEDGED CURRENCY EXPOSURE, HIGH-YIELD INVESTMENTS, ASSET-

AND MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES, AND CORPORATE CREDIT. GOVERNMENT BONDS INCLUDE BONDS ISSUED OR DEEMED TO BE GUARANTEED BY GOVERNMENT ENTITIES. GOVERNMENT BONDS INCLUDE INSTRUMENTS SUCH AS NON-U.S. GOVERNMENT BONDS, U.S. TREASURY SECURITIES, AND U.S.

AGENCY SECURITIES. WE CLASSIFIED ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES IN

THE GLOBAL BOND FUND AS LEVEL 3, AS WE HAVE USED UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS TO THE VALUATIONS THAT WERE SIGNIFICANT TO THE FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS. THE MAJORITY OF THE INCREASE IN ASSET-BACKED

SECURITIES IN 2011 REPRESENTS CURRENT-YEAR PURCHASES.

NON-U.S. PLAN ASSETS

THE INVESTMENTS OF THE NON-U.S. PLANS ARE MANAGED BY INSURANCE COMPANIES, THIRD-PARTY TRUSTEES, OR PENSION FUNDS, CONSISTENT WITH REGULATIONS OR MARKET PRACTICE OF THE COUNTRY WHERE THE ASSETS ARE INVESTED.

THE INVESTMENT MANAGER MAKES INVESTMENT DECISIONS WITHIN THE GUIDELINES SET BY INTEL OR LOCAL REGULATIONS. THE INVESTMENT MANAGER EVALUATES PERFORMANCE BY COMPARING THE ACTUAL RATE OF RETURN TO THE RETURN ON OTHER SIMILAR ASSETS. INVESTMENTS MANAGED

BY QUALIFIED INSURANCE COMPANIES OR PENSION FUNDS UNDER

STANDARD CONTRACTS FOLLOW LOCAL REGULATIONS, AND WE ARE NOT ACTIVELY INVOLVED IN THEIR INVESTMENT STRATEGIES. FOR THE ASSETS THAT WE HAVE DISCRETION TO SET INVESTMENT GUIDELINES, THE ASSETS ARE

INVESTED IN DEVELOPED COUNTRY EQUITIES AND FIXED-INCOME DEBT INSTRUMENTS, EITHER THROUGH INDEX FUNDS OR DIRECT INVESTMENT. IN GENERAL, THE INVESTMENT STRATEGY IS DESIGNED TO ACCUMULATE A DIVERSIFIED PORTFOLIO AMONG MARKETS, ASSET CLASSES, OR

INDIVIDUAL SECURITIES IN ORDER TO REDUCE MARKET RISK AND ASSURE THAT THE PENSION ASSETS ARE AVAILABLE TO PAY BENEFITS AS THEY COME DUE. THE AVERAGE EXPECTED LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN FOR THE NON-U.S. PLAN ASSETS IS 5.8%.

U.S. POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL PLAN ASSETS

IN GENERAL, THE INVESTMENT STRATEGY FOR U.S. POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL BENEFITS PLAN ASSETS IS TO PRIMARILY INVEST IN LIQUID ASSETS DUE TO THE LEVEL OF EXPECTED

FUTURE BENEFIT PAYMENTS. THE EXPECTED LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN FOR THE U.S. POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL BENEFITS PLAN ASSETS IS 3.0%. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2011, ALL OF THE U.S. POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL BENEFITS PLAN ASSETS WERE INVESTED IN A MONEY

MARKET FUND AND WERE MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE USING LEVEL 1 INPUTS.

CONCENTRATIONS OF RISK

WE MANAGE A VARIETY OF RISKS, INCLUDING MARKET, CREDIT, AND LIQUIDITY RISKS, ACROSS OUR PLAN ASSETS THROUGH OUR INVESTMENT MANAGERS. WE DEFINE A CONCENTRATION OF

RISK AS AN UNDIVERSIFIED EXPOSURE TO ONE OF THE AFOREMENTIONED RISKS THAT

INCREASES THE EXPOSURE OF THE LOSS OF PLAN ASSETS UNNECESSARILY. WE MONITOR EXPOSURE TO SUCH RISKS IN BOTH THE U.S. AND NON-U.S. PLANS BY MONITORING THE MAGNITUDE OF THE RISK IN EACH PLAN AND

DIVERSIFYING OUR EXPOSURE TO SUCH RISKS ACROSS A VARIETY OF INSTRUMENTS, MARKETS, AND COUNTERPARTIES. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2011, WE DID NOT HAVE CONCENTRATIONS OF RISK IN ANY SINGLE ENTITY, MANAGER, COUNTERPARTY, SECTOR, INDUSTRY, OR COUNTRY.

FUNDING EXPECTATIONS

UNDER APPLICABLE LAW FOR THE U.S. INTEL MINIMUM PENSION PLAN AND THE U.S. POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL BENEFITS PLAN, WE ARE NOT REQUIRED TO MAKE ANY CONTRIBUTIONS

NOTE 24: EMPLOYEE EQUITY INCENTIVE PLANS

OUR EQUITY INCENTIVE PLANS ARE BROAD-BASED, LONG-TERM PROGRAMS INTENDED TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN TALENTED EMPLOYEES AND ALIGN STOCKHOLDER AND

EMPLOYEE INTERESTS.

IN MAY 2011, STOCKHOLDERS APPROVED AN EXTENSION OF THE 2006 EQUITY INCENTIVE PLAN (THE 2006 PLAN). STOCKHOLDERS APPROVED

168 MILLION ADDITIONAL SHARES FOR ISSUANCE, INCREASING THE TOTAL SHARES OF COMMON STOCK AVAILABLE FOR ISSUANCE AS EQUITY AWARDS TO EMPLOYEES AND NON-EMPLOYEE DIRECTORS TO 596 MILLION SHARES. THE APPROVAL ALSO EXTENDED THE EXPIRATION DATE

OF THE 2006 PLAN TO JUNE 2014. THE MAXIMUM SHARES TO BE AWARDED AS NON-VESTED SHARES (RESTRICTED STOCK) OR NON-VESTED SHARE UNITS (RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS) WAS INCREASED TO 394 MILLION SHARES. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2011, 307 MILLION

SHARES REMAINED AVAILABLE FOR FUTURE GRANT UNDER THE 2006 PLAN. WE MAY ASSUME THE EQUITY INCENTIVE PLANS AND THE OUTSTANDING EQUITY AWARDS OF CERTAIN ACQUIRED COMPANIES. ONCE THEY ARE ASSUMED, WE DO NOT GRANT ADDITIONAL SHARES UNDER THOSE PLANS.

IN CONNECTION WITH OUR COMPLETED ACQUISITIONS OF MCAFEE AND WIND RIVER SYSTEMS, WE ASSUMED THEIR EQUITY INCENTIVE PLANS AND ISSUED REPLACEMENT AWARDS IN

2011 AND 2009, RESPECTIVELY. THE STOCK OPTIONS AND RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS ISSUED GENERALLY RETAIN THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THE RESPECTIVE PLANS UNDER WHICH THEY WERE ORIGINALLY GRANTED.

IN MAY 2009, STOCKHOLDERS APPROVED AN EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTION EXCHANGE PROGRAM (OPTION EXCHANGE) TO GIVE EMPLOYEES (NOT LISTED OFFICERS) THE OPPORTUNITY TO EXCHANGE ELIGIBLE STOCK OPTIONS FOR A LESSER NUMBER OF NEW

STOCK OPTIONS THAT HAVE APPROXIMATELY THE SAME FAIR VALUE AS THE OPTIONS SURRENDERED, AS OF THE DATE OF THE EXCHANGE. THE OPTION EXCHANGE COMMENCED ON SEPTEMBER 28, 2009 AND EXPIRED ON OCTOBER 30, 2009. ELIGIBLE OPTIONS INCLUDED STOCK

OPTIONS GRANTED UNDER ANY INTEL STOCK OPTION OR EQUITY INCENTIVE PLAN BETWEEN OCTOBER 1, 2000 AND SEPTEMBER 28, 2008 THAT HAD AN EXERCISE PRICE ABOVE $20.83, WHICH WAS THE 52-WEEK CLOSING-PRICE HIGH AS OF OCTOBER 30, 2009. A TOTAL OF

217 MILLION ELIGIBLE STOCK OPTIONS WERE TENDERED AND CANCELLED IN EXCHANGE FOR 83 MILLION NEW STOCK OPTIONS GRANTED. THE NEW STOCK OPTIONS HAVE AN EXERCISE PRICE OF $19.04, WHICH IS EQUAL TO THE MARKET PRICE OF INTEL COMMON STOCK (DEFINED

AS THE AVERAGE OF THE HIGH AND LOW TRADING PRICES) ON OCTOBER 30, 2009. THE NEW STOCK OPTIONS WERE ISSUED UNDER THE 2006 PLAN AND ARE SUBJECT TO ITS TERMS AND CONDITIONS. THE NEW STOCK OPTIONS VEST IN EQUAL ANNUAL INCREMENTS OVER A FOUR-YEAR

PERIOD FROM THE DATE OF GRANT AND WILL EXPIRE SEVEN YEARS FROM THE GRANT DATE. USING THE BLACK-SCHOLES OPTION PRICING MODEL, WE DETERMINED THAT THE FAIR VALUE OF THE SURRENDERED STOCK OPTIONS ON A GRANT-BY-GRANT BASIS WAS APPROXIMATELY EQUAL, AS OF

THE DATE OF THE EXCHANGE, TO THE FAIR VALUE OF THE ELIGIBLE STOCK OPTIONS EXCHANGED, RESULTING IN INSIGNIFICANT INCREMENTAL SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION.

WE ISSUE RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS WITH BOTH A MARKET CONDITION AND A SERVICE CONDITION (MARKET-BASED RESTRICTED STOCK

UNITS), REFERRED TO IN OUR 2011 PROXY STATEMENT AS OUTPERFORMANCE STOCK UNITS, TO A SMALL GROUP OF SENIOR OFFICERS AND NON-EMPLOYEE DIRECTORS. FOR MARKET-BASED RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS ISSUED IN 2011, THE NUMBER OF SHARES OF INTEL COMMON STOCK TO BE

RECEIVED AT VESTING WILL RANGE FROM 50% TO 200% OF THE TARGET AMOUNT, BASED ON TOTAL STOCKHOLDER RETURN (TSR) ON INTEL COMMON STOCK MEASURED AGAINST THE BENCHMARK TSR OF A PEER GROUP OVER A THREE-YEAR PERIOD. TSR IS A MEASURE OF STOCK PRICE

APPRECIATION PLUS ANY DIVIDENDS PAID IN THIS PERFORMANCE PERIOD. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2011, THERE WERE 4 MILLION MARKET-BASED RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS OUTSTANDING. THESE MARKET-BASED RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS ACCRUE DIVIDEND EQUIVALENTS AND

GENERALLY VEST THREE YEARS AND ONE MONTH FROM THE GRANT DATE.

EQUITY AWARDS GRANTED TO EMPLOYEES IN 2011 UNDER OUR EQUITY INCENTIVE PLANS GENERALLY VEST

OVER 4 YEARS FROM THE DATE OF GRANT, AND OPTIONS EXPIRE 7 YEARS FROM THE DATE OF GRANT, WITH THE EXCEPTION OF MARKET-BASED RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS, A SMALL NUMBER OF RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS GRANTED TO EXECUTIVE-LEVEL EMPLOYEES, AND REPLACEMENT AWARDS

RELATED TO ACQUISITIONS.

THE 2006 STOCK PURCHASE PLAN ALLOWS ELIGIBLE EMPLOYEES TO PURCHASE SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK AT 85% OF THE VALUE OF OUR COMMON

STOCK ON SPECIFIC DATES. IN MAY 2011, STOCKHOLDERS APPROVED AN EXTENSION OF THE 2006 STOCK PURCHASE PLAN. STOCKHOLDERS APPROVED 133 MILLION ADDITIONAL SHARES FOR ISSUANCE, INCREASING THE TOTAL SHARES OF COMMON STOCK AVAILABLE FOR ISSUANCE TO

373 MILLION SHARES. THE APPROVAL ALSO EXTENDED THE EXPIRATION DATE OF THE 2006 STOCK PURCHASE PLAN TO AUGUST 2016. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2011, 254 MILLION SHARES WERE AVAILABLE FOR ISSUANCE UNDER THE 2006 STOCK PURCHASE PLAN.

SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION

SHARE-BASED

COMPENSATION RECOGNIZED IN 2011 WAS $1.1 BILLION ($917 MILLION IN 2010 AND $889 MILLION IN 2009).

ON A QUARTERLY BASIS, WE ASSESS CHANGES TO OUR

ESTIMATE OF EXPECTED EQUITY AWARD FORFEITURES BASED ON OUR REVIEW OF RECENT FORFEITURE ACTIVITY AND EXPECTED FUTURE EMPLOYEE TURNOVER. WE RECOGNIZE THE EFFECT OF ADJUSTMENTS MADE TO THE FORFEITURE RATES, IF ANY, IN THE PERIOD THAT WE CHANGE THE

FORFEITURE ESTIMATE. THE EFFECT OF FORFEITURE ADJUSTMENTS IN 2011, 2010, AND 2009 WAS NOT SIGNIFICANT.

THE TOTAL SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION COST

CAPITALIZED AS PART OF INVENTORY AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2011 WAS $38 MILLION ($48 MILLION AS OF DECEMBER 25, 2010 AND $33 MILLION AS OF DECEMBER 26, 2009). DURING 2011, THE TAX BENEFIT THAT WE REALIZED FOR THE TAX DEDUCTION FROM

SHARE-BASED AWARDS TOTALED $327 MILLION ($266 MILLION IN 2010 AND $119 MILLION IN 2009).

WE BASE THE EXPECTED VOLATILITY ON IMPLIED VOLATILITY BECAUSE WE HAVE DETERMINED THAT IMPLIED VOLATILITY IS MORE REFLECTIVE OF

MARKET CONDITIONS AND A BETTER INDICATOR OF EXPECTED VOLATILITY THAN HISTORICAL VOLATILITY. PRIOR TO 2011, WE USED THE SIMPLIFIED METHOD OF CALCULATING EXPECTED LIFE DUE TO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES IN THE VESTING TERMS AND CONTRACTUAL LIFE OF CURRENT

OPTION GRANTS COMPARED TO OUR HISTORICAL GRANTS. IN 2011, WE BEGAN USING HISTORICAL OPTION EXERCISE DATA AS THE BASIS FOR DETERMINING EXPECTED LIFE, AS WE BELIEVE WE HAVE SUFFICIENT HISTORICAL DATA TO PROVIDE A REASONABLE BASIS UPON WHICH TO

ESTIMATE THE EXPECTED LIFE INPUT FOR VALUING OPTIONS USING THE BLACK-SCHOLES MODEL.

STOCK PURCHASE PLAN

APPROXIMATELY 70% OF OUR EMPLOYEES WERE PARTICIPATING IN OUR STOCK PURCHASE PLAN AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2011. EMPLOYEES PURCHASED

18.5 MILLION SHARES IN 2011 FOR $318 MILLION UNDER THE 2006 STOCK PURCHASE PLAN (17.2 MILLION SHARES FOR $281 MILLION IN 2010 AND 30.9 MILLION SHARES FOR $344 MILLION IN 2009). AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2011, THERE WAS $13 MILLION IN

UNRECOGNIZED COMPENSATION COSTS RELATED TO RIGHTS TO ACQUIRE COMMON STOCK UNDER OUR STOCK PURCHASE PLAN. WE EXPECT TO RECOGNIZE THOSE COSTS OVER A PERIOD OF APPROXIMATELY ONE AND A HALF MONTHS.

NOTE 25: COMMON STOCK REPURCHASES

COMMON STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM

WE HAVE AN ONGOING AUTHORIZATION, SINCE OCTOBER 2005, AS AMENDED, FROM OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS TO REPURCHASE UP TO $45 BILLION IN SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK IN OPEN MARKET OR NEGOTIATED TRANSACTIONS. THIS

AMOUNT INCLUDES $20 BILLION OF INCREASES IN THE AUTHORIZATION LIMIT APPROVED BY OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS IN 2011. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2011, $10.1 BILLION REMAINED AVAILABLE FOR REPURCHASE UNDER THE EXISTING REPURCHASE AUTHORIZATION LIMIT.

DURING 2011, WE REPURCHASED 642.3 MILLION SHARES OF COMMON STOCK AT A COST OF $14.1 BILLION. DURING 2010, WE REPURCHASED 70.3 MILLION SHARES OF COMMON STOCK AT A COST OF $1.5 BILLION. WE UTILIZED THE

MAJORITY OF THE PROCEEDS FROM THE ISSUANCE OF THE 2009 DEBENTURES TO REPURCHASE 88.2 MILLION SHARES AT A COST OF $1.7 BILLION DURING 2009 (FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ON THE ISSUANCE OF THE 2009

DEBENTURES, SEE NOTE 21: BORROWINGS). WE HAVE REPURCHASED 4.1 BILLION SHARES AT A COST OF $84 BILLION SINCE THE PROGRAM BEGAN IN 1990.

RESTRICTED STOCK UNIT WITHHOLDINGS

WE ISSUE RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS AS PART OF OUR

EQUITY INCENTIVE PLANS. FOR THE MAJORITY OF RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS GRANTED, THE NUMBER OF SHARES ISSUED ON THE DATE THE RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS VEST IS NET OF THE MINIMUM STATUTORY WITHHOLDING REQUIREMENTS THAT WE PAY IN CASH TO THE APPROPRIATE

TAXING AUTHORITIES ON BEHALF OF OUR EMPLOYEES. DURING 2011, WE WITHHELD 10.3 MILLION SHARES (10.1 MILLION SHARES DURING 2010 AND 5.8 MILLION SHARES DURING 2009) TO SATISFY $207 MILLION ($236 MILLION DURING 2010 AND $92 MILLION DURING 2009)

OF EMPLOYEES TAX OBLIGATIONS. ALTHOUGH SHARES WITHHELD ARE NOT ISSUED, THEY ARE TREATED AS COMMON STOCK REPURCHASES IN OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, AS THEY REDUCE THE NUMBER OF SHARES THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN ISSUED UPON VESTING.

WE COMPUTED OUR BASIC EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE USING NET INCOME AVAILABLE TO COMMON STOCKHOLDERS AND THE WEIGHTED

AVERAGE NUMBER OF COMMON SHARES OUTSTANDING DURING THE PERIOD. WE COMPUTED DILUTED EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE USING NET INCOME AVAILABLE TO COMMON STOCKHOLDERS AND THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE NUMBER OF COMMON SHARES OUTSTANDING PLUS POTENTIALLY DILUTIVE

COMMON SHARES OUTSTANDING DURING THE PERIOD. NET INCOME AVAILABLE TO PARTICIPATING SECURITIES WAS INSIGNIFICANT FOR ALL PERIODS PRESENTED.

POTENTIALLY

DILUTIVE COMMON SHARES FROM EMPLOYEE INCENTIVE PLANS ARE DETERMINED BY APPLYING THE TREASURY STOCK METHOD TO THE ASSUMED EXERCISE OF OUTSTANDING STOCK OPTIONS, THE ASSUMED VESTING OF OUTSTANDING RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS, AND THE ASSUMED ISSUANCE OF

COMMON STOCK UNDER THE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN. POTENTIALLY DILUTIVE COMMON SHARES ARE DETERMINED BY APPLYING THE IF-CONVERTED METHOD FOR THE 2005 DEBENTURES. HOWEVER, AS OUR 2009 DEBENTURES REQUIRE SETTLEMENT OF THE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF THE DEBT IN CASH

UPON CONVERSION, WITH THE CONVERSION PREMIUM PAID IN CASH OR STOCK AT OUR OPTION, POTENTIALLY DILUTIVE COMMON SHARES FOR THE 2009 DEBENTURES ARE DETERMINED BY APPLYING THE TREASURY STOCK METHOD. FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION ON THE SPECIFIC CONVERSION

FEATURES OF OUR 2005 AND 2009 DEBENTURES, SEE NOTE 21: BORROWINGS.

FOR 2011, WE EXCLUDED 90 MILLION OUTSTANDING WEIGHTED AVERAGE STOCK OPTIONS (161 MILLION IN 2010 AND

486 MILLION IN 2009) FROM THE CALCULATION OF DILUTED EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE BECAUSE THE EXERCISE PRICES OF THESE STOCK OPTIONS WERE GREATER THAN OR EQUAL TO THE AVERAGE MARKET VALUE OF THE COMMON SHARES. THESE OPTIONS COULD BE INCLUDED IN

THE CALCULATION IN THE FUTURE IF THE AVERAGE MARKET VALUE OF THE COMMON SHARES INCREASES AND IS GREATER THAN THE EXERCISE PRICE OF THE OPTIONS. IN 2011, WE INCLUDED OUR 2009 DEBENTURES IN THE CALCULATION OF DILUTED EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE BECAUSE

THE AVERAGE MARKET PRICE WAS ABOVE THE CONVERSION PRICE. IN 2010 AND 2009, WE EXCLUDED THE 2009 DEBENTURES FROM THE CALCULATION OF DILUTED EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE BECAUSE THE CONVERSION OPTION OF THE DEBENTURES WAS ANTI-DILUTIVE, AND WE COULD

POTENTIALLY EXCLUDE THE 2009 DEBENTURES AGAIN IN THE FUTURE IF THE AVERAGE MARKET PRICE IS BELOW THE CONVERSION PRICE.

INCOME IN CERTAIN FOREIGN COUNTRIES IS FULLY EXEMPT FROM INCOME TAXES FOR A LIMITED PERIOD OF TIME DUE TO ELIGIBLE

ACTIVITIES AND CERTAIN CAPITAL INVESTMENT ACTIONS. THESE FULL TAX EXEMPTIONS EXPIRE AT VARIOUS DATES THROUGH 2020; HOWEVER, THE EXEMPTIONS IN CERTAIN COUNTRIES ARE ELIGIBLE FOR RENEWAL. IN 2011, THE TAX BENEFIT ATTRIBUTABLE TO TAX HOLIDAYS WAS $554

MILLION WITH A $0.10 IMPACT ON DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE. THE TAX HOLIDAY BENEFITS FOR 2010 AND 2009 WERE $256 MILLION ($0.04 PER DILUTED SHARE) AND $115 MILLION ($0.02 PER DILUTED SHARE), RESPECTIVELY.

DURING 2011, NET INCOME TAX DEFICIENCIES ATTRIBUTABLE TO EQUITY-BASED COMPENSATION TRANSACTIONS THAT WERE ALLOCATED

TO STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY TOTALED $18 MILLION (NET BENEFITS OF $40 MILLION IN 2010 AND NET DEFICIENCIES OF $41 MILLION IN 2009).

NON-CURRENT DEFERRED TAX ASSETS ARE INCLUDED WITHIN OTHER LONG-TERM ASSETS ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS.

THE VALUATION ALLOWANCE IS BASED ON OUR ASSESSMENT THAT IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT CERTAIN DEFERRED TAX ASSETS WILL NOT BE REALIZED IN THE

FORESEEABLE FUTURE. THE VALUATION ALLOWANCE AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2011 INCLUDED ALLOWANCES RELATED TO UNREALIZED STATE CREDIT CARRYFORWARDS OF $215 MILLION AND MATTERS RELATED TO OUR NON-U.S. SUBSIDIARIES OF $158 MILLION.

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2011, OUR FEDERAL, STATE, AND FOREIGN NET OPERATING LOSS CARRYFORWARDS FOR INCOME TAX PURPOSES WERE APPROXIMATELY $317 MILLION, $320

MILLION, AND $793 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. THE MAJORITY OF THE FOREIGN NET OPERATING LOSS CARRYFORWARDS HAVE NO EXPIRATION DATE. THE REMAINING FOREIGN AS WELL AS THE U.S. FEDERAL AND STATE NET OPERATING LOSS CARRYFORWARDS EXPIRE AT VARIOUS DATES

THROUGH 2032. A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF THE NET OPERATING LOSS CARRYFORWARDS IN THE U.S. RELATES TO ACQUISITIONS AND, AS A RESULT, IS LIMITED IN THE AMOUNT THAT CAN BE RECOGNIZED IN ANY ONE YEAR. THE FOREIGN NET OPERATING LOSS CARRYFORWARDS INCLUDE

$491 MILLION THAT IS NOT LIKELY TO BE RECOVERED AND HAS BEEN REDUCED BY A VALUATION ALLOWANCE.

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2011, WE HAD NOT RECOGNIZED U.S. DEFERRED INCOME TAXES ON A CUMULATIVE TOTAL OF

$14.2 BILLION OF UNDISTRIBUTED EARNINGS FOR CERTAIN NON-U.S. SUBSIDIARIES AND $2.8 BILLION OF OTHER BASIS DIFFERENCES OF OUR INVESTMENTS IN CERTAIN NON-U.S. SUBSIDIARIES PRIMARILY RELATED TO MCAFEE. DETERMINING THE UNRECOGNIZED DEFERRED

TAX LIABILITY RELATED TO INVESTMENTS IN THESE NON-U.S. SUBSIDIARIES THAT ARE INDEFINITELY REINVESTED IS NOT PRACTICABLE. WE CURRENTLY INTEND TO INDEFINITELY REINVEST THOSE EARNINGS AND OTHER BASIS DIFFERENCES IN OPERATIONS OUTSIDE THE U.S.

LONG-TERM INCOME TAXES PAYABLE OF $165 MILLION AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2011 ($190 MILLION AS OF DECEMBER 25, 2010), WITHIN OTHER LONG-TERM

LIABILITIES, INCLUDES UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS, REDUCED BY THE ASSOCIATED FEDERAL DEDUCTION FOR STATE TAXES AND NON-U.S. TAX CREDITS, AND MAY ALSO INCLUDE OTHER LONG-TERM TAX LIABILITIES THAT ARE NOT UNCERTAIN BUT HAVE NOT YET BEEN PAID.

DURING 2011, WE SETTLED AND EFFECTIVELY SETTLED MATTERS WITH THE U.S. INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE AND CERTAIN STATE TAX

AUTHORITIES RELATED TO TAX POSITIONS TAKEN DURING PRIOR PERIODS. THE RESULT OF THE SETTLEMENTS, EFFECTIVE SETTLEMENTS, AND RESULTING REMEASUREMENTS WAS A REDUCTION OF $63 MILLION IN THE BALANCE OF OUR GROSS UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS ($73 MILLION IN

2010, $526 MILLION IN 2009), $61 MILLION OF WHICH RESULTED IN A TAX BENEFIT FOR 2011 ($48 MILLION FOR 2010, $366 MILLION FOR 2009).

IF THE REMAINING

BALANCE OF $212 MILLION OF UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2011 ($216 MILLION AS OF DECEMBER 25, 2010) WERE REALIZED IN A FUTURE PERIOD, IT WOULD RESULT IN A TAX BENEFIT OF $92 MILLION AND A REDUCTION IN THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE

($124 MILLION AS OF DECEMBER 25, 2010).

DURING ALL YEARS PRESENTED, WE RECOGNIZED INTEREST AND PENALTIES RELATED TO UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS

WITHIN THE PROVISION FOR TAXES ON THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME. IN 2011, WE RECOGNIZED AN EXPENSE OF $24 MILLION, PRIMARILY DUE TO THE ACCRUAL OF INTEREST AND PENALTIES RELATED TO FOREIGN UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS. IN 2009, WE RECOGNIZED A

NET BENEFIT OF $62 MILLION, PRIMARILY DUE TO THE REVERSAL OF ACCRUED INTEREST AND PENALTIES RELATED TO SETTLED AND EFFECTIVELY SETTLED MATTERS DESCRIBED ABOVE (INSIGNIFICANT FOR 2010). AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2011, WE HAD $90 MILLION OF ACCRUED

INTEREST AND PENALTIES RELATED TO UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS ($49 MILLION AS OF DECEMBER 25, 2010).

ALTHOUGH THE TIMING OF THE RESOLUTION AND/OR

CLOSURE ON AUDITS IS HIGHLY UNCERTAIN, IT IS REASONABLY POSSIBLE THAT THE BALANCE OF GROSS UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS COULD SIGNIFICANTLY CHANGE IN THE NEXT 12 MONTHS. HOWEVER, GIVEN THE NUMBER OF YEARS REMAINING SUBJECT TO EXAMINATION AND THE NUMBER

OF MATTERS BEING EXAMINED, WE ARE UNABLE TO ESTIMATE THE FULL RANGE OF POSSIBLE ADJUSTMENTS TO THE BALANCE OF GROSS UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS.

WE FILE

U.S. FEDERAL, U.S. STATE, AND NON-U.S. TAX RETURNS. FOR U.S. STATE AND NON-U.S. TAX RETURNS, WE ARE GENERALLY NO LONGER SUBJECT TO TAX EXAMINATIONS FOR YEARS PRIOR TO 2001. FOR U.S. FEDERAL TAX RETURNS, WE ARE NO LONGER SUBJECT TO TAX EXAMINATION

FOR YEARS PRIOR TO 2008.

NOTE 29: CONTINGENCIES

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

WE ARE CURRENTLY A PARTY TO VARIOUS LEGAL PROCEEDINGS, INCLUDING THOSE NOTED IN THIS SECTION. WHILE MANAGEMENT PRESENTLY BELIEVES THAT THE ULTIMATE OUTCOME OF THESE

PROCEEDINGS, INDIVIDUALLY AND IN THE AGGREGATE, WILL NOT MATERIALLY HARM THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL POSITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, CASH FLOWS, OR OVERALL TRENDS, LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND RELATED GOVERNMENT INVESTIGATIONS ARE SUBJECT TO INHERENT

UNCERTAINTIES, AND UNFAVORABLE RULINGS OR OTHER EVENTS COULD OCCUR. UNFAVORABLE RESOLUTIONS COULD INCLUDE SUBSTANTIAL MONETARY DAMAGES, AND IN MATTERS FOR WHICH INJUNCTIVE RELIEF OR OTHER CONDUCT REMEDIES ARE SOUGHT, AN INJUNCTION OR OTHER ORDER

PROHIBITING US FROM SELLING ONE OR MORE PRODUCTS AT ALL OR IN PARTICULAR WAYS, PRECLUDING PARTICULAR BUSINESS PRACTICES, OR REQUIRING OTHER REMEDIES SUCH AS COMPULSORY LICENSING OF IP. WERE UNFAVORABLE FINAL OUTCOMES TO OCCUR, THERE EXISTS THE

POSSIBILITY OF A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR BUSINESS, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL POSITION, AND OVERALL TRENDS. IT IS ALSO POSSIBLE THAT WE COULD CONCLUDE IT IS IN THE BEST INTERESTS OF OUR STOCKHOLDERS, EMPLOYEES, AND CUSTOMERS TO SETTLE

ONE OR MORE SUCH MATTERS, AND ANY SUCH SETTLEMENT COULD INCLUDE SUBSTANTIAL PAYMENTS; HOWEVER, WE HAVE NOT REACHED THIS CONCLUSION WITH RESPECT TO ANY PARTICULAR MATTER AT THIS TIME.

A NUMBER OF PROCEEDINGS GENERALLY HAVE CHALLENGED AND CONTINUE TO CHALLENGE CERTAIN OF OUR COMPETITIVE PRACTICES. THE ALLEGATIONS IN THESE PROCEEDINGS VARY AND ARE DESCRIBED IN MORE DETAIL IN THE FOLLOWING

PARAGRAPHS, BUT IN GENERAL CONTEND THAT WE IMPROPERLY CONDITION PRICE REBATES AND OTHER DISCOUNTS ON OUR MICROPROCESSORS ON EXCLUSIVE OR NEAR-EXCLUSIVE DEALING BY SOME OF OUR CUSTOMERS; CLAIM THAT OUR SOFTWARE COMPILER BUSINESS UNFAIRLY PREFERS

INTEL MICROPROCESSORS OVER COMPETING MICROPROCESSORS AND THAT, THROUGH THE USE OF OUR COMPILER AND OTHER MEANS, WE HAVE CAUSED INACCURATE AND MISLEADING BENCHMARK RESULTS CONCERNING OUR MICROPROCESSORS TO BE DISSEMINATED; ALLEGE THAT WE UNFAIRLY

CONTROLLED THE CONTENT AND TIMING OF RELEASE OF VARIOUS STANDARD COMPUTER INTERFACES DEVELOPED BY INTEL IN COOPERATION WITH OTHER INDUSTRY PARTICIPANTS; AND ACCUSE US OF ENGAGING IN VARIOUS ACTS OF IMPROPER COMPETITIVE ACTIVITY IN

COMPETING AGAINST WHAT IS REFERRED TO AS GENERAL-PURPOSE GRAPHICS PROCESSING UNITS, INCLUDING CERTAIN LICENSING PRACTICES AND OUR ACTIONS IN CONNECTION WITH DEVELOPING AND DISCLOSING POTENTIALLY

COMPETITIVE TECHNOLOGY.

WE BELIEVE THAT WE COMPETE LAWFULLY AND THAT OUR MARKETING, BUSINESS, IP, AND OTHER CHALLENGED PRACTICES BENEFIT OUR CUSTOMERS

AND OUR STOCKHOLDERS, AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO CONDUCT A VIGOROUS DEFENSE IN THESE PROCEEDINGS. WHILE WE HAVE SETTLED SOME OF THESE MATTERS, THE DISTRACTIONS CAUSED BY CHALLENGES TO OUR CONDUCT FROM THE REMAINING MATTERS ARE UNDESIRABLE, AND THE

LEGAL AND OTHER COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH DEFENDING AND RESOLVING OUR POSITION HAVE BEEN AND CONTINUE TO BE SIGNIFICANT. WE ASSUME THAT THESE CHALLENGES COULD CONTINUE FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS AND MAY REQUIRE THE INVESTMENT OF SUBSTANTIAL ADDITIONAL

MANAGEMENT TIME AND SUBSTANTIAL FINANCIAL RESOURCES TO EXPLAIN AND DEFEND OUR POSITION.

GOVERNMENT COMPETITION MATTERS AND RELATED

CONSUMER CLASS ACTIONS

IN 2001, THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION (EC) COMMENCED AN INVESTIGATION REGARDING CLAIMS BY ADVANCED MICRO DEVICES, INC. (AMD)

THAT WE USED UNFAIR BUSINESS PRACTICES TO PERSUADE CUSTOMERS TO BUY OUR MICROPROCESSORS. WE HAVE RECEIVED NUMEROUS REQUESTS FOR INFORMATION AND DOCUMENTS FROM THE EC, AND WE HAVE RESPONDED TO EACH OF THOSE REQUESTS. THE EC ISSUED A STATEMENT OF

OBJECTIONS IN JULY 2007 AND HELD A HEARING ON THAT STATEMENT IN MARCH 2008. THE EC ISSUED A SUPPLEMENTAL STATEMENT OF OBJECTIONS IN JULY 2008.

IN MAY

2009, THE EC ISSUED A DECISION FINDING THAT WE HAD VIOLATED ARTICLE 82 OF THE EC TREATY AND ARTICLE 54 OF THE EUROPEAN ECONOMIC AREA AGREEMENT. IN GENERAL, THE EC FOUND THAT WE VIOLATED ARTICLE 82 (LATER RENUMBERED AS ARTICLE 102 BY A NEW TREATY) BY

OFFERING ALLEGED CONDITIONAL REBATES AND PAYMENTS THAT REQUIRED OUR CUSTOMERS TO PURCHASE ALL OR MOST OF THEIR X86 MICROPROCESSORS FROM US. THE EC ALSO FOUND THAT WE VIOLATED ARTICLE 82 BY MAKING ALLEGED PAYMENTS TO PREVENT SALES

OF SPECIFIC RIVAL PRODUCTS. THE EC IMPOSED A FINE IN THE AMOUNT OF



1.06 BILLION ($1.447 BILLION AS OF MAY 2009), WHICH WE

SUBSEQUENTLY PAID DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2009, AND ALSO ORDERED US TO IMMEDIATELY BRING TO AN END THE INFRINGEMENT REFERRED TO IN THE EC DECISION. IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2009, WE RECORDED THE RELATED CHARGE WITHIN MARKETING,

GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE. WE STRONGLY DISAGREE WITH THE ECS DECISION, AND WE APPEALED THE DECISION TO THE COURT OF FIRST INSTANCE (WHICH HAS BEEN RENAMED THE GENERAL COURT) IN JULY 2009. THE EC FILED AN ANSWER TO OUR REPLY BRIEF IN NOVEMBER

2010. THE COURTS DECISION, AFTER ORAL ARGUMENT, IS EXPECTED IN LATE 2012 OR EARLY 2013.

THE EC DECISION EXCEEDS 500 PAGES AND DOES NOT CONTAIN

SPECIFIC DIRECTION ON WHETHER OR HOW WE SHOULD MODIFY OUR BUSINESS PRACTICES. INSTEAD, THE DECISION STATES THAT WE SHOULD CEASE AND DESIST FROM FURTHER CONDUCT THAT, IN THE ECS

OPINION, WOULD VIOLATE APPLICABLE LAW. WE HAVE TAKEN STEPS, WHICH ARE SUBJECT TO THE ECS ONGOING REVIEW, TO COMPLY WITH THAT DECISION PENDING APPEAL. WE OPENED DISCUSSIONS WITH THE EC TO

BETTER UNDERSTAND THE DECISION AND TO EXPLAIN CHANGES TO OUR BUSINESS PRACTICES. BASED ON OUR CURRENT UNDERSTANDING AND EXPECTATIONS, WE DO NOT BELIEVE THAT ANY SUCH CHANGES WILL BE MATERIAL TO OUR FINANCIAL POSITION, RESULTS, OR CASH FLOWS.

IN JUNE 2005, WE RECEIVED AN INQUIRY FROM THE KOREA FAIR TRADE COMMISSION (KFTC) REQUESTING DOCUMENTS FROM OUR KOREAN SUBSIDIARY RELATED TO

MARKETING AND REBATE PROGRAMS THAT WE ENTERED INTO WITH KOREAN PC MANUFACTURERS. IN FEBRUARY 2006, THE KFTC INITIATED AN INSPECTION OF DOCUMENTS AT OUR OFFICES IN KOREA. IN SEPTEMBER 2007, THE KFTC SERVED ON US AN EXAMINATION REPORT ALLEGING THAT

SALES TO TWO CUSTOMERS DURING PARTS OF 20022005 VIOLATED KOREAS MONOPOLY REGULATION AND FAIR TRADE ACT. IN DECEMBER 2007, WE SUBMITTED OUR WRITTEN RESPONSE TO THE KFTC. IN FEBRUARY 2008, THE KFTCS EXAMINER SUBMITTED A WRITTEN REPLY

TO OUR RESPONSE. IN MARCH 2008, WE SUBMITTED A FURTHER RESPONSE. IN APRIL 2008, WE PARTICIPATED IN A PRE-HEARING CONFERENCE BEFORE THE KFTC, AND WE PARTICIPATED IN FORMAL HEARINGS IN MAY AND JUNE 2008. IN JUNE 2008, THE KFTC ANNOUNCED ITS INTENT TO

FINE US APPROXIMATELY $25 MILLION FOR PROVIDING DISCOUNTS TO SAMSUNG ELECTRONICS CO., LTD. AND TRIGEM COMPUTER INC. IN NOVEMBER 2008, THE KFTC ISSUED A FINAL WRITTEN DECISION CONCLUDING THAT OUR DISCOUNTS HAD VIOLATED KOREAN ANTITRUST LAW AND

IMPOSING A FINE ON US OF APPROXIMATELY $20 MILLION, WHICH WE PAID IN JANUARY 2009. IN DECEMBER 2008, WE APPEALED THIS DECISION BY FILING A LAWSUIT IN THE SEOUL HIGH COURT SEEKING TO OVERTURN THE KFTCS DECISION. WE EXPECT A DECISION FROM THE

COURT IN 2012.

IN NOVEMBER 2009, THE STATE OF NEW YORK FILED A LAWSUIT AGAINST US IN THE U.S. DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE. THE LAWSUIT

ALLEGED THAT WE VIOLATED FEDERAL ANTITRUST LAWS; THE NEW YORK DONNELLY ACT, WHICH PROHIBITS CONTRACTS OR AGREEMENTS TO MONOPOLIZE; AND THE NEW YORK EXECUTIVE LAW, WHICH PROSCRIBES UNDERLYING VIOLATIONS OF FEDERAL AND STATE ANTITRUST LAWS. THE

LAWSUIT ALLEGED THAT WE ENGAGED IN A SYSTEMATIC WORLDWIDE CAMPAIGN OF ILLEGAL, EXCLUSIONARY CONDUCT TO MAINTAIN MONOPOLY POWER AND PRICES IN THE MARKET FOR X86 MICROPROCESSORS THROUGH THE USE OF VARIOUS ALLEGED ACTIONS, INCLUDING EXCLUSIVE OR

NEAR-EXCLUSIVE AGREEMENTS FROM LARGE COMPUTER MAKERS IN EXCHANGE FOR LOYALTY PAYMENTS AND BRIBES, AND OTHER ALLEGED THREATS AND RETALIATION. NEW YORK CLAIMED THAT OUR ALLEGED ACTIONS HARMED NEW YORK CONSUMERS, COMPETITION,

AND INNOVATION. THE COMPLAINT SOUGHT A DECLARATION THAT OUR ALLEGED ACTIONS VIOLATED FEDERAL AND NEW YORK ANTITRUST LAWS AND NEW YORK EXECUTIVE LAW; AN INJUNCTION TO PREVENT FURTHER ALLEGED UNLAWFUL ACTS; DAMAGES IN AN AMOUNT TO BE PROVEN AT TRIAL

BASED ON ALLEGED OVERCHARGES ON PURCHASES OF COMPUTERS CONTAINING INTEL MICROPROCESSORS BY NEW YORK STATE AGENCIES AND NON-STATE ENTITIES, AS WELL AS BY INDIVIDUAL NEW YORK CONSUMERS, TREBLED AS PROVIDED FOR BY LAW UNDER THE SHERMAN

ACT OR DONNELLY ACT, RESTITUTION, AND DISGORGEMENT; $1 MILLION IN CIVIL PENALTIES FOR ALLEGED VIOLATIONS OF THE DONNELLY ACT; AND ATTORNEYS FEES AND COSTS. WE DISAGREED WITH THE STATE

OF NEW YORKS ALLEGATIONS AND CLAIMS, AND NOTED THAT WE INTENDED TO CONDUCT A VIGOROUS DEFENSE OF THE LAWSUIT. WE FILED OUR ANSWER IN JANUARY 2010.

IN DECEMBER 2010, THE STATE OF NEW YORK REQUESTED THE COURTS PERMISSION TO AMEND ITS COMPLAINT TO EXPAND THE SCOPE OF PARTIES COVERED BY ITS DONNELLY ACT AND

EXECUTIVE LAW CLAIMS TO INCLUDE SMALL AND MEDIUM BUSINESSES OPERATING WITHIN THE STATE OF NEW YORK. WE OPPOSED THAT REQUEST, AND IN MAY 2011, THE COURT DENIED THE STATE OF NEW YORK PERMISSION TO AMEND ITS COMPLAINT. IN MAY 2011, WE FILED THREE

MOTIONS: THE FIRST SEEKING PARTIAL SUMMARY JUDGMENT ON ANY CLAIMS FOR DAMAGES UNDER THE SHERMAN ACT BASED ON PURCHASES OF COMPUTERS CONTAINING INTEL MICROPROCESSORS NOT MADE WITHIN FOUR YEARS OF THE FILING OF THE COMPLAINT, AND ANY CLAIMS FOR

DAMAGES UNDER THE DONNELLY ACT AND EXECUTIVE LAW BASED ON PURCHASES NOT MADE WITHIN THREE YEARS OF THE FILING OF THE COMPLAINT; THE SECOND SEEKING DISMISSAL OF ALL CLAIMS BROUGHT ON BEHALF OF NON-STATE OF NEW YORK PUBLIC ENTITIES ON THE GROUND THAT

THE STATE OF NEW YORK DID NOT OBTAIN PROPER REQUESTS TO REPRESENT THEM; AND THE THIRD SEEKING JUDGMENT ON THE PLEADINGS ON THE GROUND THAT THE STATE OF NEW YORK COULD NOT RECOVER DAMAGES ON BEHALF OF NEW YORK CONSUMERS FOR CERTAIN CLAIMS. THE COURT

GRANTED EACH OF THESE MOTIONS IN DECEMBER 2011. THESE RULINGS GREATLY REDUCED THE SCOPE OF THE NEW YORK ATTORNEY GENERALS LAWSUIT. IN ADDITION, IN OCTOBER 2011, WE FILED TWO OTHER MOTIONS FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT AND A MOTION SEEKING TO EXCLUDE

THE OPINIONS AND TESTIMONY OF NEW YORKS ECONOMIC EXPERT. WE SOUGHT SUMMARY JUDGMENT ON THE GROUNDS THAT EACH OF NEW YORKS CLAIMS LACKED LEGAL MERIT BECAUSE OUR DISCOUNTED PRICES CHALLENGED IN THE LAWSUIT WERE LAWFUL AND THAT NEW YORK

COULD NOT ESTABLISH ANTITRUST INJURY BECAUSE, AMONG OTHER THINGS, IT HAD NO EVIDENCE OF ANY HARM TO COMPETITION FROM OUR ALLEGED ACTIONS.

IN FEBRUARY

2012, WE ANNOUNCED A SETTLEMENT OF THE LAWSUIT. THE AGREEMENT, WHICH FOLLOWED THE COURTS DECEMBER 2011 RULINGS IN INTELS FAVOR, EXPRESSLY STATES THAT INTEL DOES NOT ADMIT EITHER ANY VIOLATION OF LAW OR THAT THE ALLEGATIONS IN THE

COMPLAINT ARE TRUE, AND IT CALLS FOR NO CHANGES TO THE WAY INTEL DOES BUSINESS. THE AGREEMENT INCLUDES A PAYMENT OF $6.5 MILLION FROM INTEL THAT IS INTENDED ONLY TO COVER SOME OF THE COSTS INCURRED BY THE STATE OF NEW YORK IN THE LITIGATION. NEW

YORK AGREED TO DISMISS ITS ACTION WITH PREJUDICE, CLOSE ANY PENDING INVESTIGATIONS ARISING OUT OF THE ALLEGATIONS OF THE COMPLAINT AND THOSE PREVIOUSLY INVESTIGATED BY THE FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION, AND PROVIDE A RELEASE OF CLAIMS AGAINST INTEL AND A

COVENANT NOT TO SUE. NEW YORK ALSO AGREED TO SEEK AND OBTAIN SEPARATE RELEASES FROM NON-STATE ENTITIES THAT RECEIVE ANY PORTION OF THE SETTLEMENT FUND.

AT LEAST 82 SEPARATE CLASS ACTIONS HAVE BEEN FILED IN THE U.S. DISTRICT COURTS FOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF

CALIFORNIA, SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA, DISTRICT OF IDAHO, DISTRICT OF NEBRASKA, DISTRICT OF NEW MEXICO, DISTRICT OF MAINE, AND DISTRICT OF DELAWARE, AS WELL AS IN VARIOUS CALIFORNIA, KANSAS, AND TENNESSEE STATE COURTS. THESE ACTIONS GENERALLY

REPEAT THE ALLEGATIONS MADE IN A NOW-SETTLED LAWSUIT FILED AGAINST INTEL BY AMD IN JUNE 2005 IN THE U.S. DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE (AMD LITIGATION). LIKE THE AMD LITIGATION, THESE CLASS-ACTION SUITS ALLEGE THAT INTEL ENGAGED IN

VARIOUS ACTIONS IN VIOLATION OF THE SHERMAN ACT AND OTHER LAWS BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, PROVIDING DISCOUNTS AND REBATES TO OUR MANUFACTURER AND DISTRIBUTOR CUSTOMERS CONDITIONED ON EXCLUSIVE OR NEAR-EXCLUSIVE DEALINGS THAT ALLEGEDLY UNFAIRLY

INTERFERED WITH AMDS ABILITY TO SELL ITS MICROPROCESSORS, INTERFERING WITH CERTAIN AMD PRODUCT LAUNCHES, AND INTERFERING WITH AMDS PARTICIPATION IN CERTAIN INDUSTRY STANDARDS-SETTING GROUPS. THE CLASS ACTIONS ALLEGE VARIOUS CONSUMER

INJURIES, INCLUDING THAT CONSUMERS IN VARIOUS STATES HAVE BEEN INJURED BY PAYING HIGHER PRICES FOR COMPUTERS CONTAINING OUR MICROPROCESSORS. WE DISPUTE THE CLASS-ACTION CLAIMS AND INTEND TO DEFEND THE LAWSUITS VIGOROUSLY.

ALL OF THE FEDERAL CLASS ACTIONS AND THE KANSAS AND TENNESSEE STATE COURT CLASS ACTIONS HAVE BEEN TRANSFERRED BY THE MULTIDISTRICT LITIGATION PANEL TO THE U.S.

DISTRICT COURT IN DELAWARE FOR ALL PRE-TRIAL PROCEEDINGS AND DISCOVERY (MDL PROCEEDINGS). THE DELAWARE DISTRICT COURT HAS APPOINTED A SPECIAL MASTER TO ADDRESS ISSUES IN THE MDL PROCEEDINGS, AS ASSIGNED BY THE COURT. IN JANUARY 2010, THE PLAINTIFFS

IN THE DELAWARE ACTION FILED A MOTION FOR SANCTIONS FOR OUR ALLEGED FAILURE TO PRESERVE EVIDENCE. THIS MOTION LARGELY COPIES A MOTION PREVIOUSLY FILED BY AMD IN THE AMD LITIGATION, WHICH HAS SETTLED. THE PLAINTIFFS IN THE MDL PROCEEDINGS ALSO MOVED

FOR CERTIFICATION OF A CLASS OF MEMBERS WHO PURCHASED CERTAIN PCS CONTAINING PRODUCTS SOLD BY INTEL. IN JULY 2010, THE SPECIAL MASTER ISSUED A REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION (CLASS REPORT) DENYING THE MOTION TO CERTIFY A CLASS. THE MDL PLAINTIFFS FILED

OBJECTIONS TO THE SPECIAL MASTERS CLASS REPORT, AND A HEARING ON THESE OBJECTIONS WAS HELD IN MARCH 2011. THE DELAWARE DISTRICT COURT HAS NOT YET RULED ON THOSE OBJECTIONS. ALL CALIFORNIA CLASS ACTIONS HAVE BEEN CONSOLIDATED IN THE SUPERIOR

COURT OF CALIFORNIA IN SANTA CLARA COUNTY. THE PLAINTIFFS IN THE CALIFORNIA ACTIONS HAVE MOVED FOR CLASS CERTIFICATION, WHICH WE ARE IN THE PROCESS OF OPPOSING. AT OUR REQUEST, THE COURT IN THE CALIFORNIA ACTIONS HAS AGREED TO DELAY RULING ON THIS

MOTION UNTIL AFTER THE DELAWARE DISTRICT COURT RULES ON THE SIMILAR MOTION IN THE MDL PROCEEDINGS. BASED ON THE PROCEDURAL POSTURE AND THE NATURE OF THE CASES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE FACT THAT THE SPECIAL MASTERS CLASS REPORT IS ON

REVIEW IN THE DELAWARE DISTRICT COURT, WE ARE UNABLE TO MAKE A REASONABLE ESTIMATE OF THE POTENTIAL LOSS OR RANGE OF LOSSES, IF ANY, ARISING FROM THESE MATTERS.

LEHMAN MATTER

IN NOVEMBER 2009, REPRESENTATIVES OF THE LEHMAN BROTHERS OTC DERIVATIVES INC. (LOTC) BANKRUPTCY ESTATE ADVISED US INFORMALLY THAT THE ESTATE WAS CONSIDERING A CLAIM AGAINST US ARISING FROM A 2008 CONTRACT BETWEEN

INTEL AND LOTC. UNDER THE TERMS OF THE 2008 CONTRACT, INTEL PREPAID $1.0 BILLION TO LOTC, IN EXCHANGE FOR WHICH LOTC WAS REQUIRED TO PURCHASE AND DELIVER TO INTEL THE NUMBER OF SHARES OF INTEL COMMON STOCK THAT COULD BE PURCHASED FOR $1.0 BILLION AT

THE DISCOUNTED VOLUME-WEIGHTED AVERAGE PRICE SPECIFIED IN THE CONTRACT FOR THE PERIOD SEPTEMBER 2, 2008 TO SEPTEMBER 26, 2008. LOTCS PERFORMANCE UNDER THE CONTRACT WAS SECURED BY $1.0 BILLION OF CASH COLLATERAL. UNDER THE TERMS OF

THE CONTRACT, LOTC WAS OBLIGATED TO DELIVER APPROXIMATELY 50 MILLION SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK TO US ON SEPTEMBER 29, 2008. LOTC FAILED TO DELIVER ANY SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK, AND WE EXERCISED OUR RIGHT TO SETOFF AGAINST THE $1.0

BILLION COLLATERAL. LOTC HAS NOT INITIATED ANY ACTION AGAINST US TO DATE, BUT IN FEBRUARY 2010, LOTC SERVED A SUBPOENA ON US IN CONNECTION WITH THIS TRANSACTION. IN OCTOBER 2010, LOTC DEMANDED THAT INTEL PAY IT AT LEAST $417 MILLION. IN

SEPTEMBER 2010, WE ENTERED INTO AN AGREEMENT WITH LOTC THAT TOLLED ANY APPLICABLE STATUTES OF LIMITATIONS FOR 90 DAYS AND PRECLUDED THE PARTIES FROM COMMENCING ANY FORMAL PROCEEDINGS TO PROSECUTE ANY CLAIMS AGAINST EACH OTHER IN ANY FORUM DURING

THAT PERIOD. THE TOLLING AGREEMENT WITH LOTC WAS EXTENDED SEVERAL TIMES, BUT LAPSED IN JUNE 2011. WE CONTINUE TO BELIEVE THAT WE ACTED APPROPRIATELY UNDER OUR AGREEMENT WITH LOTC, AND WE INTEND TO DEFEND ANY CLAIM TO THE CONTRARY. NO COMPLAINT HAS

BEEN FILED AND WE ARE IN THE EARLY STAGES OF EVALUATING THIS DISPUTE, AND ACCORDINGLY ARE UNABLE TO MAKE A REASONABLE ESTIMATE OF THE POTENTIAL LOSS OR RANGE OF LOSSES, IF ANY, ARISING FROM THIS MATTER.

FRANK T. SHUM V. INTEL CORPORATION, JEAN-MARC VERDIELL, AND LIGHTLOGIC, INC.

WE ACQUIRED LIGHTLOGIC, INC. IN MAY 2001. FRANK SHUM SUBSEQUENTLY SUED US, LIGHTLOGIC, AND LIGHTLOGICS FOUNDER, JEAN-MARC VERDIELL, CLAIMING THAT MUCH OF LIGHTLOGICS IP IS BASED ON ALLEGED INVENTIONS

THAT SHUM CONCEIVED WHILE HE AND VERDIELL WERE PARTNERS AT RADIANCE DESIGN, INC. SHUM HAS ALLEGED CLAIMS FOR FRAUD, BREACH OF FIDUCIARY DUTY, FRAUDULENT CONCEALMENT, AND BREACH OF CONTRACT. SHUM ALSO SEEKS ALLEGED CORRECTION OF INVENTORSHIP OF SEVEN

PATENTS ACQUIRED BY US AS PART OF THE LIGHTLOGIC ACQUISITION. IN JANUARY 2005, THE U.S. DISTRICT COURT FOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA DENIED SHUMS INVENTORSHIP CLAIM, AND THEREAFTER GRANTED OUR MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT ON

SHUMS REMAINING CLAIMS. IN AUGUST 2007, THE U.S. COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE FEDERAL CIRCUIT VACATED THE DISTRICT COURTS RULINGS AND REMANDED THE CASE FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS. IN OCTOBER 2008, THE DISTRICT COURT GRANTED OUR MOTION FOR

SUMMARY JUDGMENT ON SHUMS CLAIMS FOR BREACH OF FIDUCIARY DUTY AND FRAUDULENT CONCEALMENT, BUT DENIED OUR

MOTION ON SHUMS REMAINING CLAIMS. A JURY TRIAL ON SHUMS REMAINING CLAIMS TOOK PLACE IN NOVEMBER AND DECEMBER 2008. IN PRE-TRIAL PROCEEDINGS AND AT TRIAL, SHUM REQUESTED MONETARY

DAMAGES AGAINST THE DEFENDANTS IN AMOUNTS RANGING FROM $31 MILLION TO $931 MILLION, AND HIS FINAL REQUEST TO THE JURY WAS FOR AS MUCH AS $175 MILLION. FOLLOWING DELIBERATIONS, THE JURY WAS UNABLE TO REACH A VERDICT ON MOST OF THE CLAIMS. WITH

RESPECT TO SHUMS CLAIM THAT HE IS THE PROPER INVENTOR ON CERTAIN LIGHTLOGIC PATENTS NOW ASSIGNED TO US, THE JURY AGREED WITH SHUM ON SOME OF THOSE CLAIMS AND WAS UNABLE TO REACH A VERDICT REGARDING THE REMAINING CLAIMS. IN APRIL 2009, THE

COURT GRANTED DEFENDANTS MOTIONS FOR JUDGMENT AS A MATTER OF LAW. SHUM APPEALED THAT RULING TO THE U.S. COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE FEDERAL CIRCUIT, WHICH HEARD ORAL ARGUMENTS IN AUGUST 2010 AND AFFIRMED THE TRIAL COURTS ORDERS IN FAVOR OF

INTEL IN DECEMBER 2010. IN JANUARY 2011, SHUM PETITIONED THE FEDERAL CIRCUIT FOR A RE-HEARING AND RE-HEARING EN BANC. IN FEBRUARY 2011, THE FEDERAL CIRCUIT DENIED SHUMS REQUEST. SHUM PETITIONED THE U.S. SUPREME COURT FOR REVIEW IN MAY 2011,

AND WE FILED OUR RESPONSE IN AUGUST 2011. THE U.S. SUPREME COURT DENIED CERTIORARI IN OCTOBER 2011, ENDING THE MATTER.

THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND

STOCKHOLDERS OF INTEL CORPORATION

WE HAVE AUDITED THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS OF INTEL CORPORATION AS OF DECEMBER 31,

2011 AND DECEMBER 25, 2010, AND THE RELATED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME, STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY, AND CASH FLOWS FOR EACH OF THE THREE YEARS IN THE PERIOD ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2011. OUR AUDITS ALSO INCLUDED THE FINANCIAL STATEMENT

SCHEDULE LISTED IN THE INDEX AT PART IV, ITEM 15. THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SCHEDULE ARE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE COMPANYS MANAGEMENT. OUR RESPONSIBILITY IS TO EXPRESS AN OPINION ON THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SCHEDULE BASED

ON OUR AUDITS.

WE CONDUCTED OUR AUDITS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE STANDARDS OF THE PUBLIC COMPANY ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BOARD (UNITED STATES). THOSE

STANDARDS REQUIRE THAT WE PLAN AND PERFORM THE AUDIT TO OBTAIN REASONABLE ASSURANCE ABOUT WHETHER THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE FREE OF MATERIAL MISSTATEMENT. AN AUDIT INCLUDES EXAMINING, ON A TEST BASIS, EVIDENCE SUPPORTING THE AMOUNTS AND

DISCLOSURES IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. AN AUDIT ALSO INCLUDES ASSESSING THE ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES USED AND SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES MADE BY MANAGEMENT, AS WELL AS EVALUATING THE OVERALL FINANCIAL STATEMENT PRESENTATION. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR AUDITS

PROVIDE A REASONABLE BASIS FOR OUR OPINION.

IN OUR OPINION, THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS REFERRED TO ABOVE PRESENT FAIRLY, IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS, THE

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL POSITION OF INTEL CORPORATION AT DECEMBER 31, 2011 AND DECEMBER 25, 2010, AND THE CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF ITS OPERATIONS AND ITS CASH FLOWS FOR EACH OF THE THREE YEARS IN THE PERIOD ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2011, IN

REPORT OF ERNST & YOUNG LLP, INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND

STOCKHOLDERS OF INTEL CORPORATION

WE HAVE AUDITED INTEL CORPORATIONS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF DECEMBER 31,

2011, BASED ON CRITERIA ESTABLISHED IN INTERNAL CONTROLINTEGRATED FRAMEWORK ISSUED BY THE COMMITTEE OF SPONSORING ORGANIZATIONS OF THE TREADWAY COMMISSION (THE COSO CRITERIA). INTEL CORPORATIONS MANAGEMENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR MAINTAINING

EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, AND FOR ITS ASSESSMENT OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING INCLUDED IN THE ACCOMPANYING MANAGEMENT REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING. OUR

RESPONSIBILITY IS TO EXPRESS AN OPINION ON THE COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING BASED ON OUR AUDIT.

WE CONDUCTED OUR AUDIT IN

ACCORDANCE WITH THE STANDARDS OF THE PUBLIC COMPANY ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BOARD (UNITED STATES). THOSE STANDARDS REQUIRE THAT WE PLAN AND PERFORM THE AUDIT TO OBTAIN REASONABLE ASSURANCE ABOUT WHETHER EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL

REPORTING WAS MAINTAINED IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS. OUR AUDIT INCLUDED OBTAINING AN UNDERSTANDING OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, ASSESSING THE RISK THAT A MATERIAL WEAKNESS EXISTS, TESTING AND EVALUATING THE DESIGN AND OPERATING

EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL CONTROL BASED ON THE ASSESSED RISK, AND PERFORMING SUCH OTHER PROCEDURES AS WE CONSIDERED NECESSARY IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR AUDIT PROVIDES A REASONABLE BASIS FOR OUR OPINION.

A COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING IS A PROCESS DESIGNED TO PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING THE RELIABILITY OF FINANCIAL REPORTING

AND THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR EXTERNAL PURPOSES IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES. A COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING INCLUDES THOSE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES THAT (1) PERTAIN TO

THE MAINTENANCE OF RECORDS THAT, IN REASONABLE DETAIL, ACCURATELY AND FAIRLY REFLECT THE TRANSACTIONS AND DISPOSITIONS OF THE ASSETS OF THE COMPANY; (2) PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE THAT TRANSACTIONS ARE RECORDED AS NECESSARY TO PERMIT

PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES, AND THAT RECEIPTS AND EXPENDITURES OF THE COMPANY ARE BEING MADE ONLY IN ACCORDANCE WITH AUTHORIZATIONS OF MANAGEMENT AND DIRECTORS OF THE COMPANY; AND

(3) PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING PREVENTION OR TIMELY DETECTION OF UNAUTHORIZED ACQUISITION, USE, OR DISPOSITION OF THE COMPANYS ASSETS THAT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

BECAUSE OF ITS INHERENT LIMITATIONS, INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING MAY NOT PREVENT OR DETECT MISSTATEMENTS. ALSO, PROJECTIONS OF ANY EVALUATION OF

EFFECTIVENESS TO FUTURE PERIODS ARE SUBJECT TO THE RISK THAT CONTROLS MAY BECOME INADEQUATE BECAUSE OF CHANGES IN CONDITIONS, OR THAT THE DEGREE OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE POLICIES OR PROCEDURES MAY DETERIORATE.

IN OUR OPINION, INTEL CORPORATION MAINTAINED, IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS, EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2011, BASED ON

THE COSO CRITERIA.

WE ALSO HAVE AUDITED, IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE STANDARDS OF THE PUBLIC COMPANY ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BOARD (UNITED STATES), THE 2011

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF INTEL CORPORATION AND OUR REPORT DATED FEBRUARY 23, 2012 EXPRESSED AN UNQUALIFIED OPINION THEREON.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

EVALUATION OF DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

BASED ON MANAGEMENTS EVALUATION (WITH THE PARTICIPATION OF OUR CEO AND CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER (CFO)), AS OF THE END OF THE PERIOD COVERED BY THIS REPORT, OUR CEO AND CFO HAVE CONCLUDED THAT OUR DISCLOSURE

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES (AS DEFINED IN RULES 13A-15(E) AND 15D-15(E) UNDER THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934, AS AMENDED (THE EXCHANGE ACT)), ARE EFFECTIVE TO PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE THAT INFORMATION REQUIRED TO BE DISCLOSED BY US IN REPORTS

THAT WE FILE OR SUBMIT UNDER THE EXCHANGE ACT IS RECORDED, PROCESSED, SUMMARIZED, AND REPORTED WITHIN THE TIME PERIODS SPECIFIED IN U.S. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (SEC) RULES AND FORMS, AND IS ACCUMULATED AND COMMUNICATED TO MANAGEMENT,

INCLUDING OUR PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND PRINCIPAL FINANCIAL OFFICER, AS APPROPRIATE, TO ALLOW TIMELY DECISIONS REGARDING REQUIRED DISCLOSURE.

CHANGES IN INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

THERE WERE NO CHANGES TO OUR INTERNAL

CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING (AS DEFINED IN RULES 13A-15(F) AND 15D-15(F) UNDER THE EXCHANGE ACT) THAT OCCURRED DURING THE PERIOD COVERED BY THIS REPORT THAT HAVE MATERIALLY AFFECTED, OR ARE REASONABLY LIKELY TO MATERIALLY AFFECT, OUR INTERNAL

CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING.

MANAGEMENT REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

OUR MANAGEMENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ESTABLISHING AND MAINTAINING ADEQUATE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING (AS DEFINED IN RULES 13A-15(F) AND 15D-15(F)

UNDER THE EXCHANGE ACT) TO PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING THE RELIABILITY OF OUR FINANCIAL REPORTING AND THE PREPARATION OF CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR EXTERNAL PURPOSES IN ACCORDANCE WITH U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING

PRINCIPLES.

MANAGEMENT ASSESSED OUR INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2011, THE END OF OUR FISCAL YEAR. MANAGEMENT

BASED ITS ASSESSMENT ON CRITERIA ESTABLISHED IN INTERNAL CONTROLINTEGRATED FRAMEWORK ISSUED BY THE COMMITTEE OF SPONSORING ORGANIZATIONS OF THE TREADWAY COMMISSION. MANAGEMENTS ASSESSMENT INCLUDED EVALUATION OF ELEMENTS SUCH AS THE

DESIGN AND OPERATING EFFECTIVENESS OF KEY FINANCIAL REPORTING CONTROLS, PROCESS DOCUMENTATION, ACCOUNTING POLICIES, AND OUR OVERALL CONTROL ENVIRONMENT.

BASED ON OUR ASSESSMENT, MANAGEMENT HAS CONCLUDED THAT OUR INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING WAS EFFECTIVE AS OF THE END OF THE FISCAL YEAR TO PROVIDE

REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING THE RELIABILITY OF FINANCIAL REPORTING AND THE PREPARATION OF CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR EXTERNAL REPORTING PURPOSES IN ACCORDANCE WITH U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES. WE REVIEWED THE RESULTS

OF MANAGEMENTS ASSESSMENT WITH THE AUDIT COMMITTEE OF OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS.

OUR INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM, ERNST &

YOUNG LLP, INDEPENDENTLY ASSESSED THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, AS STATED IN THEIR ATTESTATION REPORT, WHICH IS INCLUDED AT THE END OF PART II, ITEM 8 OF THIS FORM 10-K.

INHERENT LIMITATIONS ON EFFECTIVENESS OF CONTROLS

OUR MANAGEMENT, INCLUDING THE CEO AND CFO, DOES NOT EXPECT THAT OUR DISCLOSURE CONTROLS OR OUR INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING WILL PREVENT OR DETECT ALL ERRORS AND ALL FRAUD. A CONTROL SYSTEM, NO MATTER

HOW WELL DESIGNED AND OPERATED, CAN PROVIDE ONLY REASONABLE, NOT ABSOLUTE, ASSURANCE THAT THE CONTROL SYSTEMS OBJECTIVES WILL BE MET. THE DESIGN OF A CONTROL SYSTEM MUST REFLECT THE FACT THAT THERE ARE RESOURCE CONSTRAINTS, AND THE BENEFITS OF

CONTROLS MUST BE CONSIDERED RELATIVE TO THEIR COSTS. FURTHER, BECAUSE OF THE INHERENT LIMITATIONS IN ALL CONTROL SYSTEMS, NO EVALUATION OF CONTROLS CAN PROVIDE ABSOLUTE ASSURANCE THAT MISSTATEMENTS DUE TO ERROR OR FRAUD WILL NOT OCCUR OR THAT ALL

CONTROL ISSUES AND INSTANCES OF FRAUD, IF ANY, HAVE BEEN DETECTED. THE DESIGN OF ANY SYSTEM OF CONTROLS IS BASED IN PART ON CERTAIN ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT THE LIKELIHOOD OF FUTURE EVENTS, AND THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT ANY DESIGN WILL SUCCEED IN

ACHIEVING ITS STATED GOALS UNDER ALL POTENTIAL FUTURE CONDITIONS. PROJECTIONS OF ANY EVALUATION OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF CONTROLS TO FUTURE PERIODS ARE SUBJECT TO RISKS. OVER TIME, CONTROLS MAY BECOME INADEQUATE BECAUSE OF CHANGES IN CONDITIONS OR

DETERIORATION IN THE DEGREE OF COMPLIANCE WITH POLICIES OR PROCEDURES.
