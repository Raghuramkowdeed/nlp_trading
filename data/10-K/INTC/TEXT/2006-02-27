TABLE OF CONTENTS

A

MICROPROCESSOR

IS THE CENTRAL PROCESSING UNIT

(CPU) OF A COMPUTER SYSTEM. IT PROCESSES SYSTEM DATA AND

CONTROLS OTHER DEVICES IN THE SYSTEM, ACTING AS THE

BRAINS OF THE COMPUTER. ONE INDICATOR OF A

MICROPROCESSORS PERFORMANCE IS ITS CLOCK SPEED, THE RATE

AT WHICH ITS INTERNAL LOGIC OPERATES, WHICH IS MEASURED IN UNITS

OF HERTZ, OR CYCLES PROCESSED PER SECOND. ONE MEGAHERTZ (MHZ)

EQUALS ONE MILLION CYCLES PROCESSED PER SECOND, AND ONE

GIGAHERTZ (GHZ) EQUALS ONE BILLION CYCLES PROCESSED PER SECOND.

AS COMPUTERS CONTINUE TO SUPPORT MORE USAGE MODELS, OTHER

FACTORS ARE INCREASINGLY IMPORTANT TO OVERALL PLATFORM

PERFORMANCE. FOR EXAMPLE, MICROPROCESSORS HAVE HISTORICALLY

CONTAINED ONLY ONE PROCESSOR CORE. RECENTLY, WE HAVE STARTED

OFFERING DUAL-CORE MICROPROCESSORS, SUCH AS THE

INTEL

®

CORE

TM

DUO PROCESSOR AND THE INTEL

PENTIUM

®

D PROCESSOR, WHICH CONTAIN TWO PROCESSOR CORES AND DELIVER MORE

CAPABILITIES IN THE FORM OF HIGHER SYSTEM THROUGHPUT AND

SIMULTANEOUS MANAGEMENT OF ACTIVITIES WHILE BALANCING POWER

REQUIREMENTS. OTHER EXAMPLES OF FACTORS THAT ARE INCREASINGLY

IMPORTANT TO OVERALL PLATFORM PERFORMANCE INCLUDE THE AMOUNT AND

TYPE OF MEMORY STORAGE, THE SPEED OF MEMORY ACCESS, THE

MICROARCHITECTURE DESIGN OF THE CPU AND THE SPEED OF

COMMUNICATION BETWEEN THE CPU AND THE CHIPSET. A FASTER BUS, FOR

EXAMPLE, ALLOWS FOR FASTER DATA TRANSFER INTO AND OUT OF THE

PROCESSOR, ENABLING INCREASED PERFORMANCE. A BUS CARRIES DATA

BETWEEN PARTS OF THE SYSTEM. A COMMON WAY TO CATEGORIZE

MICROPROCESSOR DESIGN ARCHITECTURES IS BY THE NUMBER OF BITS

(THE SMALLEST UNIT OF INFORMATION ON A MACHINE) THAT THE

PROCESSOR CAN HANDLE AT ONE TIME. MICROPROCESSORS CURRENTLY ARE

DESIGNED TO PROCESS 32 BITS OR 64 BITS OF INFORMATION AT ONE

TIME. MICROPROCESSORS WITH

64-BIT

PROCESSING

CAPABILITY CAN ADDRESS SIGNIFICANTLY MORE MEMORY THAN

32-BIT

MICROPROCESSORS.

THE

INTEL

®

CORE

TM

,

INTEL

®

PENTIUM

®

,

INTEL

®

CELERON

XEON

®

BRANDED PRODUCTS ARE BASED ON OUR

32-BIT

ARCHITECTURE

(IA-32),

WHILE

INTEL

®

ITANIUM

®

BRANDED PRODUCTS ARE BASED ON OUR

64-BIT

ARCHITECTURE.

ANOTHER WAY TO PROVIDE

64-BIT

PROCESSING

CAPABILITY IS FOR PROCESSORS BASED ON

32-BIT

ARCHITECTURE TO

HAVE

64-BIT

ADDRESS

EXTENSIONS. RECENT PRODUCT INTRODUCTIONS FROM OUR PENTIUM,

CELERON AND INTEL XEON PRODUCT FAMILIES ARE TYPICALLY EQUIPPED

WITH

INTEL

®

EXTENDED MEMORY 64 TECHNOLOGY

(INTEL

®

EM64T), WHICH PROVIDES

64-BIT

ADDRESS

EXTENSIONS, SUPPORTING BOTH

32-BIT

AND

64-BIT

SOFTWARE

APPLICATIONS. THE MEMORY STORAGE ON A CHIP IS MEASURED IN BYTES

(8 BITS), WITH 1,024 BYTES EQUALING A KILOBYTE (KB),

1.049 MILLION BYTES EQUALING A MEGABYTE (MB) AND

1.074 BILLION BYTES EQUALING A GIGABYTE (GB). CACHE IS A

MEMORY THAT CAN BE LOCATED DIRECTLY ON THE MICROPROCESSOR,

PERMITTING QUICKER ACCESS TO FREQUENTLY USED DATA AND

INSTRUCTIONS. SOME OF OUR MICROPROCESSORS HAVE ADDITIONAL LEVELS

OF CACHE, SECOND-LEVEL (L2) CACHE AND THIRD-LEVEL (L3) CACHE, TO

OFFER HIGHER LEVELS OF PERFORMANCE.

OTHER MICROPROCESSOR CAPABILITIES CAN ALSO ENHANCE SYSTEM

PERFORMANCE OR USER EXPERIENCE BY RUNNING SOFTWARE MORE

EFFICIENTLY. FOR EXAMPLE, WE OFFER MICROPROCESSORS WITH

INTELS HT TECHNOLOGY, WHICH ALLOWS EACH PROCESSOR CORE TO

PROCESS TWO THREADS OF INSTRUCTIONS SIMULTANEOUSLY. THIS

CAPABILITY CAN PROVIDE BENEFITS IN ONE OF TWO WAYS: IT HELPS TO

RUN MULTITHREADED SOFTWARE, WHICH IS DESIGNED TO

EXECUTE DIFFERENT PARTS OF A PROGRAM SIMULTANEOUSLY, OR IT HELPS

TO RUN MULTIPLE SOFTWARE PROGRAMS SIMULTANEOUSLY IN A

MULTITASKING ENVIRONMENT. OTHER TECHNOLOGIES INCLUDE INTEL AMT,

WHICH ALLOWS INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY MANAGERS TO DIAGNOSE, FIX

AND PROTECT ENABLED SYSTEMS THAT ARE PLUGGED IN AND CONNECTED TO

A NETWORK, EVEN IF A COMPUTER IS TURNED OFF OR HAS A FAILED HARD

DRIVE OR OPERATING SYSTEM; AND INTEL VIRTUALIZATION TECHNOLOGY,

WHICH ENABLES INCREASED UTILIZATION OF SERVERS AND ESTABLISHES A

MANAGEMENT PARTITION THAT PROVIDES INCREASED SECURITY AND

MANAGEMENT CAPABILITIES. TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THESE

TECHNOLOGIES, A COMPUTER SYSTEM MUST HAVE A MICROPROCESSOR THAT

SUPPORTS THE TECHNOLOGY, A CHIPSET AND BIOS (BASIC INPUT/OUTPUT

SYSTEM) THAT USE THE TECHNOLOGY, AND SOFTWARE THAT IS OPTIMIZED

FOR THE TECHNOLOGY. PERFORMANCE ALSO WILL VARY DEPENDING ON THE

SYSTEM HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE USED.

OUR MICROPROCESSOR SALES GENERALLY HAVE FOLLOWED A SEASONAL

TREND; HOWEVER, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THIS TREND WILL

CONTINUE. HISTORICALLY, OUR SALES OF MICROPROCESSORS HAVE BEEN

HIGHER IN THE SECOND HALF OF THE YEAR THAN IN THE FIRST HALF OF

THE YEAR. CONSUMER PURCHASES OF PCS HAVE BEEN HIGHER IN THE

SECOND HALF OF THE YEAR, PRIMARILY DUE TO

BACK-TO

-SCHOOL AND

HOLIDAY DEMAND. IN ADDITION, TECHNOLOGY PURCHASES FROM

BUSINESSES HAVE TENDED TO BE HIGHER IN THE SECOND HALF OF THE

YEAR.

THE

CHIPSET

OPERATES AS THE PCS NERVOUS

SYSTEM, SENDING DATA BETWEEN THE MICROPROCESSOR AND INPUT,

DISPLAY AND STORAGE DEVICES, SUCH AS THE KEYBOARD, MOUSE,

MONITOR, HARD DRIVE, AND CD OR DVD DRIVE. CHIPSETS PERFORM

ESSENTIAL LOGIC FUNCTIONS, SUCH AS BALANCING THE PERFORMANCE OF

THE SYSTEM AND REMOVING BOTTLENECKS. CHIPSETS ALSO EXTEND THE

GRAPHICS, AUDIO, VIDEO AND OTHER CAPABILITIES OF MANY SYSTEMS

BASED ON OUR MICROPROCESSORS. FINALLY, CHIPSETS CONTROL THE

ACCESS BETWEEN THE CPU AND MAIN MEMORY. WE OFFER CHIPSETS

COMPATIBLE WITH A VARIETY OF INDUSTRY-ACCEPTED BUS

SPECIFICATIONS, SUCH AS THE ACCELERATED GRAPHICS PORT

(AGP) SPECIFICATION, THE PERIPHERAL COMPONENTS INTERCONNECT

(PCI) LOCAL BUS SPECIFICATION AND THE PCI EXPRESS* LOCAL

BUS SPECIFICATION. PCI EXPRESS SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASES THE DATA

TRANSFER RATE OF THE ORIGINAL PCI SPECIFICATION, THEREBY

IMPROVING THE GRAPHICS AND INPUT/OUTPUT BANDWIDTH AND ENABLING

AN IMPROVED MULTIMEDIA EXPERIENCE. OUR CUSTOMERS ALSO WANT

MEMORY ARCHITECTURE ALTERNATIVES, AND AS A RESULT, WE OFFER

CHIPSETS SUPPORTING DOUBLE DATA RATE (DDR) AND DDR2

(SECOND-GENERATION, FASTER DDR MEMORY), DYNAMIC RANDOM ACCESS

MEMORY (DRAM) AND SYNCHRONOUS DRAM (SDRAM).

A

MOTHERBOARD

IS THE PRINCIPAL BOARD WITHIN A SYSTEM. A

MOTHERBOARD HAS CONNECTORS FOR ATTACHING DEVICES TO THE BUS, AND

TYPICALLY CONTAINS THE CPU, MEMORY AND THE CHIPSET. WE OFFER

MOTHERBOARD PRODUCTS DESIGNED FOR OUR MICROPROCESSORS AND

CHIPSETS, THEREBY PROVIDING A MORE COMPLETE RANGE OF SOLUTIONS

FOR OUR CUSTOMERS LOOKING FOR

INTEL

®

ARCHITECTURE-BASED SOLUTIONS. BOARD-LEVEL PRODUCTS GIVE OUR OEM

CUSTOMERS FLEXIBILITY BY ENABLING THEM TO BUY AT THE BOARD LEVEL

RATHER THAN ONLY AT THE COMPONENT LEVEL.

FLASH MEMORY

IS A SPECIALIZED TYPE OF MEMORY COMPONENT

USED TO STORE USER DATA AND PROGRAM CODE; IT RETAINS THIS

INFORMATION EVEN WHEN THE POWER IS OFF AND PROVIDES FASTER

ACCESS TO DATA THAN TRADITIONAL HARD DRIVES. FLASH MEMORY HAS NO

MOVING PARTS, UNLIKE DATA THAT IS STORED ON DEVICES SUCH AS

RAPIDLY SPINNING HARD DRIVES, ALLOWING FLASH MEMORY TO BE MORE

TOLERANT OF BUMPS AND SHOCKS. A COMMON MEASURE OF FLASH

PERFORMANCE IS THE DENSITY OF THE PRODUCT. DENSITY REFERS TO THE

AMOUNT OF INFORMATION THE PRODUCT IS CAPABLE OF STORING. FLASH

MEMORY IS BASED ON EITHER NOR OR NAND ARCHITECTURES. NOR FLASH

MEMORY, WITH ITS FAST READ CAPABILITIES, HAS

TRADITIONALLY BEEN USED TO STORE EXECUTABLE CODE. WE OFFER NOR

FLASH MEMORY PRODUCTS FOR ADVANCED MOBILE PHONE DESIGNS. OUR NOR

FLASH MEMORY IS ALSO USED IN THE EMBEDDED MARKET SEGMENT AND IS

FOUND IN VARIOUS APPLICATIONS, INCLUDING SET-TOP BOXES,

NETWORKING PRODUCTS AND OTHER DEVICES INCLUDING DVD PLAYERS AND

DSL AND CABLE MODEMS. NAND FLASH MEMORY IS SLOWER IN READING

DATA BUT FASTER IN WRITING DATA, AND HAS TRADITIONALLY BEEN USED

IN PRODUCTS THAT EITHER REQUIRED LARGE STORAGE CAPACITY OR FAST

WRITE APPLICATIONS, SUCH AS DIGITAL AUDIO PLAYERS (INCLUDING MP3

PLAYERS), AS WELL AS MEMORY CARDS AND DIGITAL CAMERAS. WE BEGAN

SELLING NAND FLASH MEMORY PRODUCTS IN FEBRUARY 2006. OUR NAND

FLASH MEMORY PRODUCTS ARE MANUFACTURED BY IM FLASH TECHNOLOGIES,

LLC (IMFT), A COMPANY WE FORMED WITH MICRON TECHNOLOGY, INC. IN

JANUARY 2006. FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION OF OUR EQUITY INVESTMENT IN

IMFT, SEE NOTE 16: VENTURE IN PART II,

INCREASED SPEED AND SIGNAL TRANSMISSION DISTANCE (COMMONLY

REFERRED TO AS REACH). GIGABIT ETHERNET NETWORKS

ALLOW THE TRANSMISSION OF ONE BILLION INDIVIDUAL BITS OF

INFORMATION PER SECOND, AND 10-GIGABIT ETHERNET NETWORKS

TRANSMIT 10 BILLION BITS OF INFORMATION PER SECOND. BY

CONTRAST, FAST ETHERNET NETWORKS TRANSMIT 100 MILLION BITS

OF INFORMATION PER SECOND (MBPS, OR MEGABITS PER SECOND). OUR

WIRELESS CONNECTIVITY PRODUCTS ARE BASED ON EITHER THE 802.11 OR

802.16 INDUSTRY STANDARD. THE 802.11 COMMUNICATION STANDARD

REFERS TO A FAMILY OF SPECIFICATIONS COMMONLY KNOWN AS WIFI

TECHNOLOGY. THESE SPECIFICATIONS DESCRIBE THE BANDWIDTH AND

FREQUENCY OF THE

OVER-THE

-AIR INTERFACE

BETWEEN A WIRELESS CLIENT AND A BASE STATION, OR BETWEEN TWO

WIRELESS CLIENTS. 802.11A, 802.11B AND 802.11G ARE THREE

DIFFERENT 802.11 SPECIFICATIONS. COMPARED TO PRODUCTS BASED ON

802.11B, PRODUCTS BASED ON 802.11A AND 802.11G SUPPORT A FASTER

EXCHANGE OF DATA. PRODUCTS BASED ON 802.11G ALSO HAVE A LONGER

RANGE THAN THOSE BASED ON 802.11A AND ALLOW FOR IMPROVED

COMPATIBILITY WITH CERTAIN NETWORKS. WE ALSO HAVE DEVELOPED AND

ARE DEVELOPING WIRELESS CONNECTIVITY SOLUTIONS FOR NETWORKS

BASED ON THE 802.16 INDUSTRY STANDARD, COMMONLY KNOWN AS WIMAX,

WHICH IS SHORT FOR WORLDWIDE INTEROPERABILITY FOR MICROWAVE

ACCESS. WIMAX IS A STANDARDS-BASED WIRELESS TECHNOLOGY PROVIDING

HIGH-SPEED, LAST-MILE BROADBAND CONNECTIVITY THAT MAKES IT

POSSIBLE TO WIRELESSLY CONNECT NETWORKS UP TO SEVERAL MILES

APART. THE CURRENT VERSIONS OF OUR WIMAX PRODUCTS ARE USED IN

HIGH-SPEED, FIXED WIRELESS BROADBAND NETWORKS.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

AS OF YEAR-END 2005, THE MAJORITY OF OUR MICROPROCESSORS WERE

MANUFACTURED ON 300MM WAFERS USING OUR 90-NANOMETER PROCESS

TECHNOLOGY. IN 2005, WE BEGAN MANUFACTURING MICROPROCESSORS ON

OUR 65-NANOMETER PROCESS TECHNOLOGY, THE NEXT GENERATION BEYOND

OUR 90-NANOMETER PROCESS TECHNOLOGY. AS WE MOVE TO EACH

SUCCEEDING GENERATION OF MANUFACTURING PROCESS TECHNOLOGY, WE

INCUR SIGNIFICANT

START-UP

COSTS TO GET

EACH FACTORY READY FOR HIGH-VOLUME MANUFACTURING. HOWEVER,

CONTINUING TO ADVANCE OUR PROCESS TECHNOLOGY PROVIDES ADDED

BENEFITS THAT WE BELIEVE JUSTIFY THESE COSTS. THESE BENEFITS CAN

INCLUDE UTILIZING LESS SPACE PER TRANSISTOR, WHICH ENABLES US TO

PUT MORE TRANSISTORS ON AN EQUIVALENT SIZE CHIP, DECREASING THE

SIZE OF THE CHIP OR ALLOWING US TO OFFER AN INCREASED NUMBER OF

INTEGRATED FEATURES. THESE ADVANCEMENTS CAN RESULT IN HIGHER

PERFORMING MICROPROCESSORS, PRODUCTS THAT CONSUME LESS POWER

AND/OR PRODUCTS THAT COST LESS TO MANUFACTURE. TO AUGMENT

CAPACITY IN THE U.S. AND INTERNATIONALLY, WE USE THIRD-PARTY

MANUFACTURING COMPANIES (FOUNDRIES) TO MANUFACTURE WAFERS

FOR CERTAIN COMPONENTS, INCLUDING NETWORKING AND COMMUNICATIONS

PRODUCTS.

IN JANUARY 2006, WE FORMED IMFT, A NAND FLASH MEMORY

MANUFACTURING COMPANY, WITH MICRON. IMFT MANUFACTURES FOR INTEL

AND MICRON, AND WE CURRENTLY PURCHASE 49% OF THE

PART II, ITEM 8 OF THIS

FORM

10-K.

WE PRIMARILY USE SUBCONTRACTORS TO MANUFACTURE BOARD-LEVEL

PRODUCTS AND SYSTEMS, AND PURCHASE CERTAIN COMMUNICATIONS

NETWORKING PRODUCTS FROM EXTERNAL VENDORS, PRIMARILY IN THE

ASIA-PACIFIC REGION. WE ALSO MANUFACTURE MICROPROCESSOR- AND

NETWORKING-RELATED BOARD-LEVEL PRODUCTS, PRIMARILY IN MALAYSIA.

FOLLOWING MANUFACTURE, THE MAJORITY OF OUR COMPONENTS ARE

SUBJECT TO ASSEMBLY IN SEVERAL TYPES OF PACKAGING, AND TO

TESTING. WE PERFORM A SUBSTANTIAL MAJORITY OF OUR COMPONENTS

ASSEMBLY AND TEST AT FACILITIES IN MALAYSIA, CHINA, THE

PHILIPPINES AND COSTA RICA. WE PLAN TO CONTINUE TO INVEST IN NEW

ASSEMBLY AND TEST TECHNOLOGIES AND FACILITIES TO KEEP PACE WITH

OUR MICROPROCESSOR, CHIPSET, FLASH MEMORY AND COMMUNICATIONS

TECHNOLOGY IMPROVEMENTS. TO AUGMENT CAPACITY, WE USE

SUBCONTRACTORS TO PERFORM ASSEMBLY OF CERTAIN PRODUCTS,

PRIMARILY FLASH MEMORY, CHIPSETS, AND NETWORKING AND

COMMUNICATIONS PRODUCTS. ASSEMBLY AND TEST OF NAND FLASH MEMORY

PRODUCTS MANUFACTURED BY IMFT IN 2006 IS PERFORMED BY MICRON.

OUR PERFORMANCE EXPECTATIONS FOR BUSINESS INTEGRITY; ETHICS; AND

ENVIRONMENTAL, HEALTH AND SAFETY COMPLIANCE ARE THE SAME

REGARDLESS OF WHETHER OUR SUPPLIER AND SUBCONTRACTOR OPERATIONS

ARE BASED IN THE U.S. OR ELSEWHERE. OUR EMPLOYMENT

PRACTICES ARE CONSISTENT WITH, AND WE EXPECT OUR SUPPLIERS AND

SUBCONTRACTORS TO ABIDE BY, LOCAL COUNTRY LAW. IN ADDITION, WE

IMPOSE A MINIMUM EMPLOYEE AGE REQUIREMENT REGARDLESS OF LOCAL

LAW.

WE HAVE THOUSANDS OF SUPPLIERS, INCLUDING SUBCONTRACTORS,

PROVIDING OUR VARIOUS MATERIALS AND SERVICE NEEDS. WE SET

EXPECTATIONS FOR SUPPLIER PERFORMANCE AND REINFORCE THOSE

EXPECTATIONS WITH PERIODIC ASSESSMENTS. WE COMMUNICATE THOSE

EXPECTATIONS TO OUR SUPPLIERS REGULARLY AND WORK WITH THEM TO

IMPLEMENT IMPROVEMENTS WHEN NECESSARY. WE SEEK, WHERE POSSIBLE,

TO HAVE SEVERAL SOURCES OF SUPPLY FOR ALL OF THESE MATERIALS AND

RESOURCES, BUT WE MAY RELY ON A SINGLE OR LIMITED NUMBER OF

SUPPLIERS, OR UPON SUPPLIERS IN A SINGLE COUNTRY. IN THOSE

CASES, WE DEVELOP AND IMPLEMENT PLANS AND ACTIONS TO REDUCE THE

EXPOSURE THAT WOULD RESULT FROM A DISRUPTION IN SUPPLY.

OUR PRODUCTS TYPICALLY ARE PRODUCED AT MULTIPLE INTEL FACILITIES

AT VARIOUS SITES AROUND THE WORLD, OR BY SUBCONTRACTORS WHO HAVE

MULTIPLE FACILITIES. HOWEVER, SOME PRODUCTS ARE PRODUCED IN ONLY

ONE INTEL OR SUBCONTRACTOR FACILITY, AND WE SEEK TO IMPLEMENT

ACTIONS AND PLANS TO REDUCE THE EXPOSURE THAT WOULD RESULT FROM

A DISRUPTION AT ANY SUCH FACILITY. ON A WORLDWIDE BASIS, WE

REGULARLY REVIEW OUR KEY INFRASTRUCTURE, SYSTEMS, SERVICES AND

SUPPLIERS, BOTH INTERNALLY AND EXTERNALLY, TO SEEK TO IDENTIFY

SIGNIFICANT VULNERABILITIES AS WELL AS AREAS OF POTENTIAL

BUSINESS IMPACT IF A DISRUPTIVE EVENT WERE TO OCCUR. ONCE A

VULNERABILITY IS IDENTIFIED, WE ASSESS THE RISKS, AND AS WE

CONSIDER IT TO BE APPROPRIATE, WE INITIATE ACTIONS INTENDED TO

REDUCE THE RISKS AND THEIR POTENTIAL IMPACT. HOWEVER, THERE CAN

BE NO ASSURANCE THAT WE HAVE IDENTIFIED ALL SIGNIFICANT RISKS OR

THAT WE CAN MITIGATE ALL IDENTIFIED RISKS WITH REASONABLE

EFFORT. SEE RISK FACTORS IN PART I,

IN OUR RETENTION OF A LEVEL OF RISK ON A SELF-INSURANCE BASIS.

THE TYPES AND AMOUNTS OF INSURANCE OBTAINED VARY FROM TIME TO

TIME AND FROM LOCATION TO LOCATION DEPENDING ON AVAILABILITY,

COST AND OUR DECISIONS WITH RESPECT TO RISK RETENTION. OUR

WORLDWIDE RISK AND INSURANCE PROGRAMS ARE REGULARLY EVALUATED TO

SEEK TO OBTAIN THE MOST FAVORABLE TERMS AND CONDITIONS.

TECHNOLOGIES THAT WILL ENABLE AN ADVANCED WIRELESS PLATFORM,

INCLUDING 802.16 PRODUCTS (WIMAX). ADDITIONALLY, WE CONTINUE TO

INVEST IN NEW PACKAGING AND TESTING PROCESSES, AS WELL AS

IMPROVING EXISTING PRODUCTS AND REDUCING MANUFACTURING COSTS.

WE HAVE AN AGREEMENT WITH MICRON FOR JOINT DEVELOPMENT OF NAND

FLASH MEMORY TECHNOLOGIES. COSTS INCURRED BY INTEL AND MICRON

FOR PROCESS DEVELOPMENT ARE GENERALLY SPLIT EVENLY. AS THE OWNER

OF THE PRODUCT DESIGNS, INTEL ASSUMES THE COST FOR PRODUCT

DEVELOPMENT. INTEL LICENSES CERTAIN PRODUCT DESIGNS TO MICRON ON

A ROYALTY-BEARING BASIS.

WE DO NOT EXPECT THAT ALL OF OUR RESEARCH AND PRODUCT

DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS WILL RESULT IN PRODUCTS THAT ARE ULTIMATELY

RELEASED FOR SALE. WE MAY TERMINATE RESEARCH AND/OR PRODUCT

DEVELOPMENT BEFORE COMPLETION OR DECIDE NOT TO MANUFACTURE AND

SELL A DEVELOPED PRODUCT FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS. FOR EXAMPLE,

WE MAY DECIDE THAT A PRODUCT MIGHT NOT BE SUFFICIENTLY

COMPETITIVE IN THE RELEVANT MARKET SEGMENT, OR FOR TECHNOLOGICAL

OR MARKETING REASONS, WE MAY DECIDE TO OFFER A DIFFERENT PRODUCT

INSTEAD.

OUR R&D MODEL IS BASED ON A GLOBAL ORGANIZATION THAT

EMPHASIZES A COLLABORATIVE APPROACH IN IDENTIFYING AND

DEVELOPING NEW TECHNOLOGIES, LEADING STANDARDS INITIATIVES AND

INFLUENCING REGULATORY POLICY TO ACCELERATE THE ADOPTION OF NEW

TECHNOLOGIES. OUR R&D INITIATIVES ARE PERFORMED BY VARIOUS

BUSINESS GROUPS WITHIN THE COMPANY, AND WE ALIGN AND PRIORITIZE

THESE INITIATIVES ACROSS THESE BUSINESS GROUPS. WE ALSO WORK

WITH A WORLDWIDE NETWORK OF ACADEMIC AND INDUSTRY RESEARCHERS,

SCIENTISTS AND ENGINEERS IN THE COMPUTING AND COMMUNICATIONS

FIELDS. OUR NETWORK OF TECHNOLOGY PROFESSIONALS ALLOWS US, AS

WELL AS OTHERS IN OUR INDUSTRY, TO BENEFIT FROM DEVELOPMENT

INITIATIVES IN A VARIETY OF AREAS, EVENTUALLY LEADING TO

INNOVATIVE TECHNOLOGIES FOR USERS. WE BELIEVE THAT WE ARE WELL

POSITIONED IN THE TECHNOLOGY INDUSTRY TO HELP DRIVE INNOVATION,

FOSTER COLLABORATION AND PROMOTE INDUSTRY STANDARDS THAT WILL

YIELD INNOVATIVE AND IMPROVED TECHNOLOGIES FOR USERS.

WE PERFORM A SUBSTANTIAL MAJORITY OF OUR RESEARCH AND

DEVELOPMENT OF SEMICONDUCTOR COMPONENTS AND OTHER PRODUCTS IN

THE U.S. OUTSIDE THE U.S., WE HAVE BEEN INCREASING OUR

PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT, AND WE HAVE ACTIVITIES AT VARIOUS

LOCATIONS, INCLUDING ISRAEL, CHINA, INDIA, RUSSIA AND MALAYSIA.

WE ALSO MAINTAIN R&D FACILITIES IN THE U.S. FOCUSED ON

DEVELOPING AND IMPROVING MANUFACTURING PROCESSES, AS WELL AS

FACILITIES IN THE U.S., MALAYSIA AND THE PHILIPPINES DEDICATED

TO IMPROVEMENTS IN ASSEMBLY AND TEST PROCESSES.

EMPLOYEES

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2005, WE EMPLOYED APPROXIMATELY 99,900

PEOPLE WORLDWIDE, WITH MORE THAN 50% OF THESE EMPLOYEES LOCATED

IN THE U.S.

SALES AND MARKETING

MOST OF OUR PRODUCTS ARE SOLD OR LICENSED THROUGH SALES OFFICES

LOCATED NEAR MAJOR CONCENTRATIONS OF USERS, THROUGHOUT THE

AMERICAS, ASIA-PACIFIC, EUROPE AND JAPAN. OUR BUSINESS RELIES ON

CONTINUED SALES GROWTH IN BOTH MATURE AND EMERGING MARKETS.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

SALES OF OUR PRODUCTS ARE TYPICALLY MADE VIA PURCHASE ORDERS

THAT CONTAIN STANDARD TERMS AND CONDITIONS COVERING MATTERS SUCH

AS PRICING, PAYMENT TERMS AND WARRANTIES, AS WELL AS INDEMNITIES

FOR ISSUES SPECIFIC TO OUR PRODUCTS, SUCH AS PATENT AND

COPYRIGHT INDEMNITIES. FROM TIME TO TIME, WE MAY ENTER INTO

ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS WITH CUSTOMERS COVERING, FOR EXAMPLE,

CHANGES FROM OUR STANDARD TERMS AND CONDITIONS, NEW PRODUCT

DEVELOPMENT AND MARKETING, PRIVATE-LABEL BRANDING AND OTHER

MATTERS. MOST OF OUR SALES ARE MADE USING ELECTRONIC AND

WEB-BASED PROCESSES THAT ALLOW THE CUSTOMER TO REVIEW INVENTORY

AVAILABILITY AND TRACK THE PROGRESS OF SPECIFIC GOODS UNDER

ORDER. PRICING ON PARTICULAR PRODUCTS MAY VARY BASED ON VOLUMES

ORDERED AND OTHER FACTORS.

WE SELL OUR PRODUCTS TO OEMS AND ODMS. ODMS PROVIDE DESIGN

AND/OR MANUFACTURING SERVICES TO BRANDED AND UNBRANDED

PRIVATE-LABEL RESELLERS. WE ALSO SELL OUR PRODUCTS TO INDUSTRIAL

AND RETAIL DISTRIBUTORS. IN 2005, DELL INC. ACCOUNTED FOR

APPROXIMATELY 19% OF OUR TOTAL SALES, AND HEWLETT-PACKARD

COMPANY ACCOUNTED FOR APPROXIMATELY 16% OF OUR TOTAL SALES. NO

OTHER CUSTOMER ACCOUNTED FOR MORE THAN 10% OF OUR TOTAL REVENUE.

TYPICALLY, DISTRIBUTORS HANDLE A WIDE VARIETY OF PRODUCTS,

INCLUDING THOSE THAT COMPETE WITH OUR PRODUCTS, AND FILL ORDERS

FOR MANY CUSTOMERS. MOST OF OUR SALES TO DISTRIBUTORS ARE MADE

UNDER AGREEMENTS ALLOWING FOR PRICE PROTECTION ON UNSOLD

MERCHANDISE AND A RIGHT OF RETURN ON STIPULATED QUANTITIES OF

UNSOLD MERCHANDISE. WE ALSO UTILIZE THIRD-PARTY SALES

REPRESENTATIVES WHO GENERALLY DO NOT OFFER DIRECTLY COMPETITIVE

PRODUCTS BUT MAY CARRY COMPLEMENTARY ITEMS MANUFACTURED BY

OTHERS. SALES REPRESENTATIVES DO NOT MAINTAIN A PRODUCT

INVENTORY; INSTEAD, THEIR CUSTOMERS PLACE ORDERS DIRECTLY WITH

US OR THROUGH DISTRIBUTORS.

OUR WORLDWIDE RESELLER SALES CHANNEL CONSISTS OF THOUSANDS OF

INDIRECT CUSTOMERS WHO ARE SYSTEMS BUILDERS AND

PURCHASE INTEL MICROPROCESSORS AND OTHER PRODUCTS FROM OUR

DISTRIBUTORS. THESE SYSTEMS BUILDERS RECEIVE VARIOUS LEVELS OF

TECHNICAL AND MARKETING SERVICES AND SUPPORT DIRECTLY FROM

INTEL. WE HAVE A BOXED PROCESSOR PROGRAM THAT ALLOWS

DISTRIBUTORS TO SELL INTEL MICROPROCESSORS IN SMALL QUANTITIES

TO THESE SYSTEMS-BUILDER CUSTOMERS; BOXED PROCESSORS ARE ALSO

MADE AVAILABLE IN DIRECT RETAIL OUTLETS.

THE INTEL CORPORATE AND PRODUCT BRAND IDENTITIES WERE REVAMPED

IN EARLY 2006 TO SIGNAL INTELS NEW BUSINESS STRATEGY TO

DELIVER CUSTOMER-FOCUSED PLATFORM SOLUTIONS. THE CHANGES INCLUDE

A NEW INTEL LOGO, TAGLINE (INTEL. LEAP

AHEAD.

TM

)

AND SIGNATURE SOUND. OUR PLATFORM SOLUTIONS BRANDS, WHICH

INTEGRATE PROCESSORS WITH OTHER INNOVATIVE HARDWARE AND

SOFTWARE, INCLUDE INTEL CENTRINO MOBILE TECHNOLOGY AND INTEL

VIIV TECHNOLOGY. THE ITANIUM, INTEL XEON, INTEL CORE, PENTIUM,

AND INTEL CELERON TRADEMARKS MAKE UP OUR PROCESSOR BRANDS. WE

PROMOTE BRAND AWARENESS AND GENERATE DEMAND THROUGH OUR OWN

DIRECT MARKETING AS WELL AS CO-MARKETING PROGRAMS. OUR DIRECT

MARKETING ACTIVITIES INCLUDE TELEVISION, PRINT AND WEB-BASED

ADVERTISING, AS WELL AS PRESS RELATIONS, CONSUMER AND TRADE

EVENTS, AND INDUSTRY AND CONSUMER COMMUNICATIONS. CURRENTLY, OUR

DIRECT MARKETING TO THE CONSUMER FOCUSES ON DIGITAL HOME

ENTERTAINMENT AND BUILDING AWARENESS AND DEMAND FOR NEW USAGE

MODELS AND CAPABILITIES. FOR BUSINESSES, OUR MARKETING TO LARGE

ENTERPRISES AND SMALL TO MID-SIZE ORGANIZATIONS FOCUSES ON

DELIVERY OF PRODUCTS AND TECHNOLOGIES DESIGNED FOR PERFORMANCE

PER WATT, RELIABILITY, MANAGEABILITY AND SECURITY.

PURCHASES BY CUSTOMERS OFTEN ALLOW THEM TO PARTICIPATE IN

COOPERATIVE ADVERTISING AND MARKETING PROGRAMS SUCH AS THE INTEL

INSIDE

®

PROGRAM. THROUGH THE INTEL INSIDE PROGRAM, CERTAIN CUSTOMERS ARE

LICENSED TO PLACE INTEL LOGOS ON COMPUTERS CONTAINING OUR

MICROPROCESSORS AND OUR OTHER TECHNOLOGY, AND TO USE OUR BRANDS

IN MARKETING ACTIVITIES. THE PROGRAM INCLUDES A MARKET

DEVELOPMENT COMPONENT THAT ACCRUES FUNDS BASED ON PURCHASES AND

PARTIALLY REIMBURSES THE OEMS FOR MARKETING ACTIVITIES FOR

PRODUCTS FEATURING INTEL BRANDS, SUBJECT TO THE OEMS MEETING

DEFINED CRITERIA. THIS PROGRAM BROADENS THE REACH OF OUR BRANDS

BEYOND THE SCOPE OF OUR OWN DIRECT ADVERTISING.

OUR PRODUCTS ARE TYPICALLY SHIPPED UNDER TERMS THAT TRANSFER

TITLE TO THE CUSTOMER, EVEN IN ARRANGEMENTS FOR WHICH THE

RECOGNITION OF REVENUE ON THE SALE IS DEFERRED. OUR STANDARD

TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF SALE TYPICALLY PROVIDE THAT PAYMENT IS

DUE AT A LATER DATE, GENERALLY 30 DAYS AFTER SHIPMENT,

DELIVERY OR THE CUSTOMERS USE OF THE PRODUCT. OUR CREDIT

DEPARTMENT SETS ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND SHIPPING LIMITS FOR

INDIVIDUAL CUSTOMERS FOR THE PURPOSE OF CONTROLLING CREDIT RISK

TO INTEL ARISING FROM OUTSTANDING ACCOUNT BALANCES. WE ASSESS

CREDIT RISK THROUGH QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE ANALYSIS, AND

FROM THIS ANALYSIS, WE ESTABLISH CREDIT LIMITS AND DETERMINE

WHETHER WE WILL SEEK TO USE ONE OR MORE CREDIT SUPPORT DEVICES,

SUCH AS OBTAINING SOME FORM OF THIRD-PARTY GUARANTY OR STANDBY

LETTER OF CREDIT, OR OBTAINING CREDIT INSURANCE FOR ALL OR A

PORTION OF THE ACCOUNT BALANCE. CREDIT LOSSES MAY STILL BE

INCURRED DUE TO BANKRUPTCY, FRAUD OR OTHER FAILURE OF THE

CUSTOMER TO PAY. SEE SCHEDULE IIVALUATION AND

TABLE OF CONTENTS

BACKLOG

WE DO NOT BELIEVE THAT A BACKLOG AS OF ANY PARTICULAR DATE IS

INDICATIVE OF FUTURE RESULTS. OUR SALES ARE MADE PRIMARILY

PURSUANT TO STANDARD PURCHASE ORDERS FOR DELIVERY OF STANDARD

PRODUCTS. WE HAVE SOME AGREEMENTS THAT GIVE A CUSTOMER THE RIGHT

TO PURCHASE A SPECIFIC NUMBER OF PRODUCTS DURING A SPECIFIED

TIME PERIOD. ALTHOUGH THESE AGREEMENTS DO NOT GENERALLY OBLIGATE

THE CUSTOMER TO PURCHASE ANY PARTICULAR NUMBER OF SUCH PRODUCTS,

SOME OF THESE AGREEMENTS DO CONTAIN BILLBACK CLAUSES. UNDER

THESE CLAUSES, CUSTOMERS WHO DO NOT PURCHASE THE FULL VOLUME

AGREED UPON ARE LIABLE FOR BILLBACK ON PREVIOUS SHIPMENTS UP TO

THE PRICE APPROPRIATE FOR THE QUANTITY ACTUALLY PURCHASED. AS A

MATTER OF INDUSTRY PRACTICE, BILLBACK CLAUSES ARE DIFFICULT TO

ENFORCE. THE QUANTITIES ACTUALLY PURCHASED BY THE CUSTOMER, AS

WELL AS THE SHIPMENT SCHEDULES, ARE FREQUENTLY REVISED DURING

THE AGREEMENT TERM TO REFLECT CHANGES IN THE CUSTOMERS

NEEDS. IN LIGHT OF INDUSTRY PRACTICE AND OUR EXPERIENCE, WE DO

NOT BELIEVE THAT SUCH AGREEMENTS ARE MEANINGFUL FOR DETERMINING

BACKLOG AMOUNTS. ONLY A SMALL PORTION OF OUR ORDER BACKLOG IS

NON-CANCELABLE, AND THE DOLLAR AMOUNT ASSOCIATED WITH THE

NON-CANCELABLE PORTION IS NOT SIGNIFICANT.

COMPETITION

OUR PRODUCTS COMPETE PRIMARILY ON THE BASIS OF PERFORMANCE,

FEATURES, QUALITY, BRAND RECOGNITION, PRICE AND AVAILABILITY.

OUR ABILITY TO COMPETE DEPENDS ON OUR ABILITY TO PROVIDE

INNOVATIVE PRODUCTS AND WORLDWIDE SUPPORT FOR OUR CUSTOMERS,

INCLUDING PROVIDING ENHANCED PERFORMANCE PER WATT, REDUCED HEAT

OUTPUT AND INTEGRATED SOLUTIONS. IN ADDITION TO OUR VARIOUS

COMPUTING, NETWORKING AND COMMUNICATIONS PRODUCTS, WE OFFER

TECHNOLOGY PLATFORM SOLUTIONS THAT INCORPORATE OUR VARIOUS

COMPONENTS, WHICH BRING TOGETHER A COLLECTION OF TECHNOLOGIES

THAT WE BELIEVE CREATE A BETTER END-USER SOLUTION THAN IF THE

INGREDIENTS WERE USED SEPARATELY.

THE SEMICONDUCTOR INDUSTRY IS CHARACTERIZED BY RAPID ADVANCES IN

TECHNOLOGY AND NEW PRODUCT INTRODUCTIONS. AS UNIT VOLUMES GROW,

PRODUCTION EXPERIENCE IS ACCUMULATED AND COSTS DECREASE, FURTHER

COMPETITION DEVELOPS, AND AS A RESULT, PRICES DECLINE. THE LIFE

CYCLE OF OUR PRODUCTS IS VERY SHORT, SOMETIMES LESS THAN A YEAR.

OUR ABILITY TO COMPETE DEPENDS ON OUR ABILITY TO IMPROVE OUR

PRODUCTS AND PROCESSES FASTER THAN OUR COMPETITORS, ANTICIPATE

CHANGING CUSTOMER REQUIREMENTS, AND DEVELOP AND LAUNCH NEW

PRODUCTS, WHILE REDUCING OUR COSTS. WHEN WE BELIEVE IT IS

APPROPRIATE, WE WILL TAKE VARIOUS STEPS, INCLUDING INTRODUCING

NEW PRODUCTS AND PLATFORM SOLUTIONS, DISCONTINUING OLDER

PRODUCTS, REDUCING PRICES, AND OFFERING REBATES AND OTHER

INCENTIVES, TO INCREASE ACCEPTANCE OF OUR LATEST PRODUCTS AND TO

BE COMPETITIVE WITHIN EACH RELEVANT MARKET SEGMENT. OUR PRODUCTS

COMPETE WITH PRODUCTS DEVELOPED FOR SIMILAR OR RIVAL

ARCHITECTURES AND WITH PRODUCTS BASED ON THE SAME OR RIVAL

TECHNOLOGY STANDARDS. WE CANNOT PREDICT WHICH COMPETING

TECHNOLOGY STANDARDS WILL BECOME THE PREVAILING STANDARDS IN THE

MARKET SEGMENTS IN WHICH WE COMPETE.

MANY COMPANIES COMPETE WITH US IN THE VARIOUS COMPUTING,

NETWORKING AND COMMUNICATIONS MARKET SEGMENTS, AND ARE ENGAGED

IN THE SAME BASIC FIELDS OF ACTIVITY, INCLUDING RESEARCH AND

DEVELOPMENT. WORLDWIDE, THESE COMPETITORS RANGE IN SIZE FROM

LARGE ESTABLISHED MULTINATIONAL COMPANIES WITH MULTIPLE PRODUCT

LINES TO SMALLER COMPANIES AND NEW ENTRANTS TO THE MARKETPLACE

THAT COMPETE IN SPECIALIZED MARKET SEGMENTS. IN SOME CASES, OUR

COMPETITORS ARE ALSO OUR CUSTOMERS AND/OR SUPPLIERS. PRODUCT

OFFERINGS MAY CROSS OVER INTO MULTIPLE PRODUCT CATEGORIES,

OFFERING US NEW OPPORTUNITIES BUT ALSO RESULTING IN MORE

COMPETITORS. IN MARKET SEGMENTS WHERE OUR COMPETITORS HAVE

ESTABLISHED PRODUCTS AND BRAND RECOGNITION, IT MAY BE DIFFICULT

FOR US TO COMPETE AGAINST THEM.

WE BELIEVE THAT OUR NETWORK OF MANUFACTURING FACILITIES AND

ASSEMBLY AND TEST FACILITIES GIVES US A COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE.

THIS NETWORK ENABLES US TO HAVE MORE DIRECT CONTROL OVER OUR

PROCESSES, QUALITY CONTROL, PRODUCT COST, VOLUME AND TIMING OF

PRODUCTION, AND OTHER FACTORS. THESE TYPES OF FACILITIES ARE

VERY EXPENSIVE, AND MANY OF OUR COMPETITORS DO NOT OWN SUCH

FACILITIES, BECAUSE THEY CANNOT AFFORD TO DO SO OR BECAUSE THEIR

BUSINESS MODELS INVOLVE THE USE OF THIRD-PARTY FACILITIES FOR

MANUFACTURING AND ASSEMBLY AND TEST. THESE FABLESS

SEMICONDUCTOR COMPANIES INCLUDE BROADCOM CORPORATION,

NVIDIA CORPORATION, QUALCOMM INCORPORATED AND VIA TECHNOLOGIES,

INC. (VIA). SOME OF OUR COMPETITORS OWN PORTIONS OF SUCH

FACILITIES THROUGH INVESTMENT OR JOINT-VENTURE ARRANGEMENTS WITH

OTHER COMPANIES. THERE IS A GROUP OF THIRD-PARTY MANUFACTURING

COMPANIES (FOUNDRIES) AND ASSEMBLY AND TEST SUBCONTRACTORS THAT

OFFER THEIR SERVICES TO COMPANIES WITHOUT OWNED FACILITIES OR

COMPANIES NEEDING ADDITIONAL CAPACITY. THESE FOUNDRIES AND

SUBCONTRACTORS MAY ALSO OFFER TO OUR COMPETITORS INTELLECTUAL

PROPERTY, DESIGN SERVICES, AND OTHER GOODS AND SERVICES.

COMPETITORS WHO OUTSOURCE THEIR MANUFACTURING AND ASSEMBLY AND

TEST OPERATIONS CAN SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE THEIR CAPITAL

EXPENDITURES.

12

TABLE OF CONTENTS

WE PLAN TO CONTINUE TO CULTIVATE NEW BUSINESSES AND WORK WITH

THE COMPUTING AND COMMUNICATIONS INDUSTRIES THROUGH STANDARDS

BODIES, TRADE ASSOCIATIONS, OEMS, ODMS, AND INDEPENDENT SOFTWARE

AND OPERATING SYSTEM VENDORS TO ALIGN THE INDUSTRY TO OFFER

PRODUCTS THAT TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE LATEST MARKET TRENDS AND

USAGE MODELS. THESE EFFORTS INCLUDE HELPING TO CREATE THE

INFRASTRUCTURE FOR WIRELESS NETWORK CONNECTIVITY. WE ARE ALSO

WORKING WITH THESE INDUSTRIES TO DEVELOP SOFTWARE APPLICATIONS

AND OPERATING SYSTEMS THAT TAKE ADVANTAGE OF OUR PLATFORMS. WE

FREQUENTLY PARTICIPATE IN INDUSTRY INITIATIVES DESIGNED TO

DISCUSS AND AGREE UPON TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS AND OTHER

ASPECTS OF TECHNOLOGIES THAT COULD BE ADOPTED AS STANDARDS BY

STANDARDS-SETTING ORGANIZATIONS. IN ADDITION, WE WORK

COLLABORATIVELY WITH OTHER COMPANIES TO PROTECT DIGITAL CONTENT

AND THE CONSUMER BY DEVELOPING CONTENT PROTECTION SPECIFICATIONS

SUCH AS THE DIGITAL TRANSMISSION CONTENT PROTECTION (DTCP)

SPECIFICATION. DTCP DEFINES A SECURE PROTOCOL FOR PROTECTING

AUDIO AND VIDEO ENTERTAINMENT CONTENT FROM ILLEGAL COPYING,

INTERCEPTING AND TAMPERING AS IT MOVES ACROSS DIGITAL INTERFACES

SUCH AS UNIVERSAL SERIAL BUS (USB) AND

IP-BASED

HOME NETWORKS.

OUR COMPETITORS MAY ALSO PARTICIPATE IN THE SAME INITIATIVES AND

SPECIFICATION DEVELOPMENT, AND OUR PARTICIPATION DOES NOT ENSURE

THAT ANY STANDARDS OR SPECIFICATIONS ADOPTED BY THESE

ORGANIZATIONS WILL BE CONSISTENT WITH OUR PRODUCT PLANNING. WE

CONTINUOUSLY EVALUATE ALL OF OUR PRODUCT OFFERINGS AND THE

TIMING OF THEIR INTRODUCTION, TAKING INTO ACCOUNT FACTORS SUCH

AS CUSTOMER REQUIREMENTS AND AVAILABILITY OF INFRASTRUCTURE TO

TAKE ADVANTAGE OF PRODUCT PERFORMANCE AND MATURITY OF

APPLICATIONS SOFTWARE FOR EACH TYPE OF PRODUCT IN THE RELEVANT

MARKET SEGMENTS.

COMPANIES IN THE SEMICONDUCTOR INDUSTRY OFTEN RELY ON THE

ABILITY TO LICENSE PATENTS FROM EACH OTHER IN ORDER TO COMPETE

IN TODAYS MARKETS. MANY OF OUR COMPETITORS HAVE BROAD

CROSS-LICENSES OR LICENSES WITH US, AND UNDER CURRENT CASE LAW,

SOME SUCH LICENSES MAY PERMIT THESE COMPETITORS TO PASS OUR

PATENT RIGHTS ON TO OTHERS. IF ONE OF THESE LICENSEES BECOMES A

FOUNDRY, OUR COMPETITORS MIGHT BE ABLE TO AVOID OUR PATENT

RIGHTS IN MANUFACTURING COMPETING PRODUCTS. IN ADDITION TO

LICENSING OUR PATENTS TO COMPETITORS, WE PARTICIPATE IN SOME

INDUSTRY ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE ENGAGED IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF

STANDARDS OR SPECIFICATIONS AND MAY REQUIRE US TO LICENSE OUR

PATENTS TO OTHER COMPANIES THAT ADOPT SUCH INDUSTRY STANDARDS OR

SPECIFICATIONS, EVEN WHEN SUCH ORGANIZATIONS DO NOT ADOPT THE

STANDARDS OR SPECIFICATIONS PROPOSED BY INTEL. ANY INTEL PATENTS

IMPLICATED BY OUR PARTICIPATION IN SUCH INITIATIVES MIGHT NOT,

IN SOME SITUATIONS, BE AVAILABLE FOR US TO ENFORCE AGAINST

OTHERS WHO MIGHT BE INFRINGING THOSE PATENTS.

WE CONTINUE TO BE LARGELY DEPENDENT ON THE SUCCESS OF OUR

MICROPROCESSOR BUSINESS. MANY OF OUR COMPETITORS, INCLUDING

ADVANCED MICRO DEVICES, INC. (AMD), OUR PRIMARY MICROPROCESSOR

COMPETITOR, MARKET SOFTWARE-COMPATIBLE PRODUCTS THAT COMPETE

WITH INTEL ARCHITECTURE-BASED PROCESSORS. WE ALSO FACE

COMPETITION FROM COMPANIES OFFERING RIVAL MICROPROCESSOR

DESIGNS, SUCH AS INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS MACHINES CORPORATION

(IBM), WHICH IS JOINTLY DEVELOPING A RIVAL ARCHITECTURE DESIGN

WITH SONY CORPORATION AND TOSHIBA CORPORATION. OUR DESKTOP

PROCESSORS COMPETE WITH PRODUCTS OFFERED BY AMD, IBM AND VIA,

AMONG OTHERS. OUR MOBILE MICROPROCESSOR PRODUCTS COMPETE WITH

PRODUCTS OFFERED BY AMD, IBM, TRANSMETA CORPORATION AND VIA,

AMONG OTHERS. OUR SERVER PROCESSORS COMPETE WITH

SOFTWARE-COMPATIBLE PRODUCTS OFFERED BY AMD AND WITH PRODUCTS

BASED ON RIVAL ARCHITECTURES, INCLUDING THOSE OFFERED BY IBM AND

SUN MICROSYSTEMS, INC.

OUR CHIPSETS COMPETE IN THE VARIOUS MARKET SEGMENTS AGAINST

DIFFERENT TYPES OF CHIPSETS THAT SUPPORT EITHER OUR

MICROPROCESSOR PRODUCTS OR RIVAL MICROPROCESSOR PRODUCTS.

COMPETING CHIPSETS ARE PRODUCED BY COMPANIES SUCH AS ATI

TECHNOLOGIES, INC., BROADCOM, NVIDIA, SILICON INTEGRATED SYSTEMS

CORPORATION (SIS) AND VIA. WE ALSO COMPETE WITH COMPANIES

OFFERING GRAPHICS COMPONENTS AND OTHER SPECIAL-PURPOSE PRODUCTS

USED IN THE DESKTOP, MOBILE AND SERVER MARKET SEGMENTS. ONE

ASPECT OF OUR BUSINESS MODEL IS TO INCORPORATE IMPROVED

PERFORMANCE AND ADVANCED PROPERTIES INTO OUR MICROPROCESSORS AND

CHIPSETS, THE DEMAND FOR WHICH MAY INCREASINGLY BE AFFECTED BY

COMPETITION FROM COMPANIES, SUCH AS ATI AND NVIDIA, WHOSE

BUSINESS MODELS ARE BASED ON INCORPORATING PERFORMANCE INTO

DEDICATED CHIPSETS AND OTHER COMPONENTS, SUCH AS GRAPHICS

CONTROLLERS.

OUR NOR FLASH MEMORY PRODUCTS CURRENTLY COMPETE WITH THE

PRODUCTS OF OTHER COMPANIES, SUCH AS SAMSUNG ELECTRONICS CO.,

LTD., SPANSION INC., AND STMICROELECTRONICS NV. THE MEGABIT

DEMAND OF THE PRODUCTS THAT MAKE USE OF FLASH MEMORY IS

INCREASING, AND OUR NOR FLASH MEMORY PRODUCTS FACE INCREASED

COMPETITION FROM COMPANIES THAT MANUFACTURE NAND FLASH MEMORY

PRODUCTS, AS OEMS LOOK FOR OPPORTUNITIES TO USE NAND FLASH

MEMORY PRODUCTS WITH ADDITIONAL RANDOM ACCESS MEMORY OR IN

COMBINATION WITH NOR FLASH MEMORY FOR EXECUTABLE-CODE

APPLICATIONS. IN JANUARY 2006, WE FORMED IMFT, A NAND FLASH

MEMORY MANUFACTURING COMPANY, WITH MICRON THAT MAY PROVIDE US

WITH MORE COMPETITIVE OPPORTUNITIES WITH REGARD TO NAND FLASH

MEMORY PRODUCTS. SEE NOTE 16: VENTURE IN

PART II, ITEM 8 OF THIS

FORM

10-K.

WE ALSO OFFER PRODUCTS DESIGNED FOR WIRED AND WIRELESS

CONNECTIVITY; FOR THE COMMUNICATIONS INFRASTRUCTURE, INCLUDING

NETWORK PROCESSORS; AND FOR NETWORKED STORAGE. THESE PRODUCTS

CURRENTLY COMPETE AGAINST OFFERINGS FROM COMPANIES SUCH AS

APPLIED MICRO CIRCUITS CORPORATION, AMD, BROADCOM, FREESCALE

SEMICONDUCTOR, INC., IBM, MARVELL TECHNOLOGY GROUP LTD., NMS

COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION, OPNEXT, INC. AND SUN MICROSYSTEMS.

ACQUISITIONS AND STRATEGIC INVESTMENTS

DURING 2005, WE COMPLETED THREE ACQUISITIONS QUALIFYING AS

BUSINESS COMBINATIONS IN EXCHANGE FOR AGGREGATE NET CASH

CONSIDERATION OF $177 MILLION, PLUS CERTAIN LIABILITIES.

ALSO DURING 2005, WE ACQUIRED A DEVELOPMENT-STAGE OPERATION THAT

RESULTED IN THE RECORDING OF

WORKFORCE-IN

-PLACE OF

$20 MILLION. AN ACQUISITION OF A DEVELOPMENT-STAGE

OPERATION DOES NOT QUALIFY AS A BUSINESS COMBINATION. DURING

2004, WE COMPLETED ONE ACQUISITION QUALIFYING AS A BUSINESS

COMBINATION IN EXCHANGE FOR NET CASH CONSIDERATION OF

APPROXIMATELY $33 MILLION, PLUS CERTAIN LIABILITIES. IN

ADDITION, WE ENTERED INTO CERTAIN ARRANGEMENTS IN 2004 RELATED

TO THE HIRING OF A GROUP OF EMPLOYEES THAT RESULTED IN THE

RECORDING OF AN INTANGIBLE ASSET FOR

WORKFORCE-IN

-PLACE OF

$28 MILLION.

WE MAKE EQUITY INVESTMENTS IN COMPANIES AROUND THE WORLD TO

FURTHER OUR STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES AND SUPPORT OUR KEY BUSINESS

INITIATIVES, INCLUDING INVESTMENTS THROUGH OUR INTEL CAPITAL

PROGRAM. WE GENERALLY FOCUS ON INVESTING IN COMPANIES AND

INITIATIVES TO STIMULATE GROWTH IN THE DIGITAL ECONOMY, CREATE

NEW BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES FOR INTEL AND EXPAND GLOBAL MARKETS

FOR OUR PRODUCTS. THE INVESTMENTS MAY SUPPORT, AMONG OTHER

THINGS, INTEL PRODUCT INITIATIVES, EMERGING TRENDS IN THE

TECHNOLOGY INDUSTRY OR WORLDWIDE INTERNET DEPLOYMENT. WE INVEST

IN COMPANIES THAT DEVELOP SOFTWARE, HARDWARE OR SERVICES

SUPPORTING OUR TECHNOLOGIES. OUR CURRENT INVESTMENT FOCUS AREAS

INCLUDE HELPING TO ENABLE MOBILE WIRELESS DEVICES, ADVANCE THE

DIGITAL HOME, ENHANCE THE DIGITAL ENTERPRISE, ADVANCE

HIGH-PERFORMANCE COMMUNICATIONS INFRASTRUCTURES AND DEVELOP THE

NEXT GENERATION OF SILICON PRODUCTION TECHNOLOGIES. OUR FOCUS

AREAS TEND TO DEVELOP AND CHANGE OVER TIME DUE TO RAPID

ADVANCEMENTS IN TECHNOLOGY. MANY OF OUR INVESTMENTS ARE IN

PRIVATE COMPANIES, INCLUDING DEVELOPMENT-STAGE COMPANIES WITH

LITTLE OR NO REVENUE FROM CURRENT PRODUCT OFFERINGS. IN JANUARY

2006, INTEL FORMED IMFT, A NAND FLASH MEMORY MANUFACTURING

COMPANY, WITH MICRON. INTEL INVESTED $1.2 BILLION IN RETURN

FOR 49% OF THE EQUITY OF IMFT. SEE NOTE 16.

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND LICENSING

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS THAT APPLY TO OUR VARIOUS PRODUCTS

AND SERVICES INCLUDE PATENTS, COPYRIGHTS, TRADE SECRETS,

TRADEMARKS AND MASKWORK RIGHTS. WE MAINTAIN AN ACTIVE PROGRAM TO

PROTECT OUR INVESTMENT IN TECHNOLOGY BY ATTEMPTING TO ENSURE

RESPECT FOR OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS. THE EXTENT OF THE

LEGAL PROTECTION GIVEN TO DIFFERENT TYPES OF INTELLECTUAL

PROPERTY RIGHTS VARIES UNDER DIFFERENT COUNTRIES LEGAL

SYSTEMS. WE INTEND TO LICENSE OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS

WE HAVE FILED AND OBTAINED A NUMBER OF PATENTS IN THE U.S. AND

ABROAD. WHILE OUR PATENTS ARE AN IMPORTANT ELEMENT OF OUR

SUCCESS, OUR BUSINESS AS A WHOLE IS NOT MATERIALLY DEPENDENT ON

ANY ONE PATENT. WE AND OTHER COMPANIES IN THE COMPUTING,

TELECOMMUNICATIONS AND RELATED HIGH-TECHNOLOGY FIELDS TYPICALLY

APPLY FOR AND RECEIVE, IN THE AGGREGATE, TENS OF THOUSANDS OF

OVERLAPPING PATENTS ANNUALLY IN THE U.S. AND OTHER COUNTRIES. WE

BELIEVE THAT THE DURATION OF THE APPLICABLE PATENTS WE ARE

GRANTED IS ADEQUATE RELATIVE TO THE EXPECTED LIVES OF OUR

PRODUCTS. BECAUSE OF THE FAST PACE OF INNOVATION AND PRODUCT

DEVELOPMENT, OUR PRODUCTS ARE OFTEN OBSOLETE BEFORE THE PATENTS

RELATED TO THEM EXPIRE, AND SOMETIMES ARE OBSOLETE BEFORE THE

PATENTS RELATED TO THEM ARE EVEN GRANTED. AS WE EXPAND OUR

PRODUCT OFFERINGS INTO NEW INDUSTRIES, SUCH AS CONSUMER

ELECTRONICS, WE ALSO SEEK TO EXTEND OUR PATENT DEVELOPMENT

EFFORTS TO PATENT SUCH PRODUCT OFFERINGS. ESTABLISHED

COMPETITORS IN EXISTING AND NEW INDUSTRIES, AS WELL AS COMPANIES

THAT PURCHASE AND ENFORCE PATENTS AND OTHER INTELLECTUAL

PROPERTY, MAY ALREADY HAVE PATENTS COVERING SIMILAR PRODUCTS.

THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO OBTAIN PATENTS

COVERING OUR OWN PRODUCTS, OR THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO OBTAIN

LICENSES FROM SUCH COMPANIES ON FAVORABLE TERMS OR AT ALL.

THE LARGE MAJORITY OF THE SOFTWARE WE DISTRIBUTE, INCLUDING

SOFTWARE EMBEDDED IN OUR COMPONENT AND SYSTEM-LEVEL PRODUCTS, IS

ENTITLED TO COPYRIGHT PROTECTION. IN MOST CIRCUMSTANCES, WE

REQUIRE OUR CUSTOMERS TO ENTER INTO A SOFTWARE LICENSE BEFORE WE

PROVIDE THEM WITH THAT SOFTWARE.

TO DISTINGUISH INTEL PRODUCTS FROM OUR COMPETITORS

PRODUCTS, WE HAVE OBTAINED CERTAIN TRADEMARKS AND TRADE NAMES

FOR OUR PRODUCTS, AND WE MAINTAIN COOPERATIVE ADVERTISING

PROGRAMS WITH CERTAIN CUSTOMERS TO PROMOTE OUR BRANDS AND

IDENTIFY PRODUCTS CONTAINING GENUINE INTEL COMPONENTS.

WE ALSO PROTECT CERTAIN DETAILS ABOUT OUR PROCESSES, PRODUCTS

AND STRATEGIES AS TRADE SECRETS, KEEPING CONFIDENTIAL THE

INFORMATION THAT WE BELIEVE PROVIDES US WITH A COMPETITIVE

ADVANTAGE. WE HAVE ONGOING PROGRAMS DESIGNED TO MAINTAIN THE

CONFIDENTIALITY OF SUCH INFORMATION.

COMPLIANCE WITH ENVIRONMENTAL, HEALTH AND SAFETY

REGULATIONS

INTEL IS COMMITTED TO ACHIEVING HIGH STANDARDS OF ENVIRONMENTAL

QUALITY AND PRODUCT SAFETY, AND STRIVES TO PROVIDE A SAFE AND

HEALTHY WORKPLACE FOR OUR EMPLOYEES, OUR CONTRACTORS AND THE

COMMUNITIES IN WHICH WE DO BUSINESS. WE HAVE ENVIRONMENTAL,

HEALTH AND SAFETY (EHS) POLICIES AND EXPECTATIONS THAT ARE

APPLIED TO OUR GLOBAL OPERATIONS. EACH OF INTELS WORLDWIDE

MANUFACTURING AND ASSEMBLY AND TEST SITES IS REGISTERED TO THE

INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATION FOR STANDARDIZATION (ISO) 14001

ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT SYSTEM STANDARD, WHICH REQUIRES THAT A

BROAD RANGE OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT PROCESSES AND POLICIES

BE IN PLACE TO CONTINUALLY IMPROVE ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE,

MAINTAIN COMPLIANCE WITH ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS AND

COMMUNICATE EFFECTIVELY WITH INTERESTED STAKEHOLDERS.

INTELS INTERNAL ENVIRONMENTAL AUDITING PROGRAM INCLUDES

NOT ONLY COMPLIANCE COMPONENTS, BUT ALSO MODULES ON BUSINESS

RISK, ENVIRONMENTAL EXCELLENCE AND MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS. WE HAVE

INTERNAL PROCESSES THAT FOCUS ON MINIMIZING AND PROPERLY

MANAGING HAZARDOUS MATERIALS USED IN OUR FACILITIES AND

PRODUCTS. WE MONITOR REGULATORY AND RESOURCE TRENDS AND SET

COMPANY-WIDE SHORT- AND LONG-TERM PERFORMANCE TARGETS FOR KEY

RESOURCES AND EMISSIONS. THESE TARGETS ADDRESS SEVERAL

PARAMETERS, INCLUDING ENERGY AND WATER USE, CLIMATE CHANGE,

WASTE RECYCLING AND EMISSIONS. INTEL REMAINS ON TRACK TO ACHIEVE

OUR VOLUNTARY COMMITMENT TO REDUCE EMISSIONS OF CERTAIN GLOBAL

WARMING GASES USED IN MANUFACTURING BY 10% FROM 1995 LEVELS BY

2010. DUE TO INTELS INCREASE IN MANUFACTURING SINCE 1995,

THIS WILL EQUATE TO AN ACTUAL REDUCTION IN 2010 OF MORE THAN 90%

FROM WHAT INTEL WOULD HAVE EMITTED WITHOUT THE VOLUNTARY

REDUCTION. WE ALSO CONTINUE TO TAKE SEVERAL ACTIONS TO FURTHER

OUR GLOBAL ENERGY REDUCTION GOAL, SUCH AS INVESTING IN ENERGY

CONSERVATION PROJECTS IN OUR FACTORIES AND WORKING WITH

SUPPLIERS OF MANUFACTURING TOOLS TO IMPROVE ENERGY EFFICIENCY.

WE EXPECT THAT THESE ACTIONS WILL RESULT IN ENERGY COST SAVINGS

AND IMPROVED EFFICIENCY IN THE USE OF ELECTRICITY, NATURAL GAS

AND WATER. IN ADDITION, WE HAVE ADOPTED WATER NEEDS AND REUSE

STRATEGIES THAT ALIGN WITH LOCAL COMMUNITY EXPECTATIONS

REGARDLESS OF WHERE WE OPERATE. AS SUCH, WE CONTINUE TO EMPLOY

WATER USE REDUCTION STRATEGIES THAT SEEK TO OPTIMIZE THE BALANCE

BETWEEN ULTRA-PURE WATER NEEDS AND REUSE OPTIONS FOR INDUSTRIAL

WATER.

AS MOORES LAW DRIVES INCREASING COMPUTING POWER YEAR AFTER

YEAR, MANAGING THE POWER CONSUMPTION OF THE PC BECOMES AN

INCREASING CHALLENGE. INTEL HAS BEEN A LEADER IN DEVELOPING

INNOVATIVE SOLUTIONS TO ADDRESS AND RESOLVE POWER CHALLENGES. TO

BE SUCCESSFUL, INTEL HAS TAKEN A HOLISTIC APPROACH TO POWER

MANAGEMENT, ADDRESSING THE CHALLENGE AT ALL LEVELS, INCLUDING

THE SILICON, PACKAGE, CIRCUIT, MICRO/MACRO ARCHITECTURE,

PLATFORM AND SOFTWARE LEVELS. A FEW EXAMPLES INCLUDE NOVEL

TRANSISTOR AND CHIP DESIGNS SUCH AS STRAINED SILICON AND SLEEP

TRANSISTORS, ENHANCED INTEL

SPEEDSTEP

®

TECHNOLOGY FOR MOBILE AND DESKTOP PLATFORMS, AND DEMAND BASED

SWITCHING (DBS) TECHNOLOGY FOR SERVER PLATFORMS.

THE MANUFACTURE AND ASSEMBLY AND TESTING OF INTEL PRODUCTS

REQUIRES THE USE OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS THAT ARE SUBJECT TO A

BROAD ARRAY OF EHS LAWS AND REGULATIONS. INTEL ACTIVELY MONITORS

THE HAZARDOUS MATERIALS THAT ARE USED IN THE MANUFACTURE AND

ASSEMBLY AND TESTING OF OUR PRODUCTS, PARTICULARLY MATERIALS

THAT END UP IN THE FINAL PRODUCT. INTEL HAS DEVELOPED SPECIFIC

RESTRICTIONS ON THE CONTENT OF CERTAIN HAZARDOUS MATERIALS IN

OUR PRODUCTS, AS WELL AS THOSE OF OUR SUPPLIERS AND OUTSOURCED

MANUFACTURERS AND SUBCONTRACTORS. INTELS EFFORTS TO REDUCE

HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES IN OUR PRODUCTS HAS POSITIONED US WELL TO

MEET THE VARIOUS ENVIRONMENTAL RESTRICTIONS ON PRODUCT CONTENT

THROUGHOUT THE WORLD, SUCH AS THE RESTRICTION ON HAZARDOUS

SUBSTANCES (ROHS) DIRECTIVE IN THE EUROPEAN UNION (EU). THE ROHS

DIRECTIVE ELIMINATES MOST USES OF LEAD, CADMIUM,

HEXAVALENT-CHROMIUM, MERCURY AND CERTAIN FIRE RETARDANTS IN

ELECTRONICS PUT ON THE MARKET AFTER JULY 1, 2006. INTEL

PUBLISHED ITS LEAD-FREE PRODUCT ROADMAP IN APRIL 2004, AND WE

ALREADY MANUFACTURE AND SHIP MANY PRODUCTS THAT ARE ROHS

COMPLIANT (E.G., FLASH MEMORY PRODUCTS; MOBILE, DESKTOP, AND

SERVER CPUS; CHIPSETS; NETWORK INTERFACE CARDS; WIRELESS CARDS;

AND ROHS COMPLIANT PLATFORMS). INTELS ROADMAP IS DESIGNED

TO ENABLE ALL INTEL PRODUCTS SOLD INTO THE EU TO BE ROHS

COMPLIANT BEFORE JULY 1, 2006. THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA ALSO

HAS ADOPTED RESTRICTIONS ON THE USE OF CERTAIN MATERIALS IN

ELECTRONIC PRODUCTS THAT ARE INTENDED TO HARMONIZE WITH THE EU

ROHS DIRECTIVE. THOSE RESTRICTIONS GO INTO EFFECT IN 2007. OTHER

U.S. STATES ARE CONSIDERING SIMILAR LEGISLATION. SIMILARLY,

CHINA HAS PROMULGATED USE RESTRICTIONS ON THE SAME SUBSTANCES AS

THE EU ROHS DIRECTIVE. CHINA HAS NOT YET DEFINED EITHER THE

SCOPE OF AFFECTED PRODUCTS OR AN EFFECTIVE DATE OF THE

REGULATION. INTEL IS WORKING WITH CHINAS MINISTRY OF

INFORMATION INDUSTRY TO PROMOTE CONSISTENCY BETWEEN CHINAS

USE RESTRICTIONS AND THE EU ROHS DIRECTIVE.

AS INTEL CONTINUES TO ADVANCE PROCESS TECHNOLOGY, THE MATERIALS,

TECHNOLOGIES AND PRODUCTS THEMSELVES BECOME INCREASINGLY

COMPLEX. OUR EVALUATIONS OF NEW MATERIALS FOR USE IN R&D,

MANUFACTURING, AND ASSEMBLY AND TEST TAKE INTO ACCOUNT EHS

CONSIDERATIONS AND ARE A COMPONENT OF INTELS DESIGN FOR

EHS PROCESSES. COMPLIANCE WITH THESE COMPLEX LAWS AND

REGULATIONS, AS WELL AS INTERNAL VOLUNTARY PROGRAMS, IS

INTEGRATED INTO OUR MANUFACTURING AND ASSEMBLY AND TEST

PROCESSES. TO OUR KNOWLEDGE, COMPLIANCE WITH THESE LAWS AND

REGULATIONS HAS HAD NO MATERIAL EFFECT ON OUR OPERATIONS.

INTEL IS COMMITTED TO THE PROTECTION OF HUMAN RIGHTS AND THE

ENVIRONMENT THROUGHOUT ITS SUPPLY CHAIN. INTEL EXPECTS SUPPLIERS

TO UNDERSTAND AND FULLY COMPLY WITH ALL APPLICABLE

INTERNATIONAL, NATIONAL, STATE AND LOCAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS,

INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ALL EHS AND RELATED LAWS AND

REGULATIONS. IN ADDITION, SUPPLIERS ARE EXPECTED TO ABIDE BY ALL

INTEL RULES; MAINTAIN PROGRESSIVE EMPLOYMENT PRACTICES; AND

COMPLY WITH ALL APPLICABLE LAWS INCLUDING, AT A MINIMUM, THOSE

COVERING NON-DISCRIMINATION IN THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF

EMPLOYMENT, CHILD LABOR, MINIMUM WAGES, EMPLOYEE BENEFITS AND

WORK HOURS.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE IS TYPICALLY DEFINED AS THE SYSTEM THAT

ALLOCATES DUTIES AND AUTHORITY AMONG A COMPANYS

STOCKHOLDERS, BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND MANAGEMENT. THE

STOCKHOLDERS ELECT THE BOARD AND VOTE ON EXTRAORDINARY MATTERS;

THE BOARD IS THE COMPANYS GOVERNING BODY, RESPONSIBLE FOR

HIRING, OVERSEEING AND EVALUATING MANAGEMENT, PARTICULARLY THE

CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER (CEO); AND MANAGEMENT RUNS THE

COMPANYS

DAY-TO

-DAY OPERATIONS.

THE BOARD BELIEVES THAT THERE SHOULD BE A SUBSTANTIAL MAJORITY

OF INDEPENDENT DIRECTORS ON THE BOARD. THE BOARD ALSO BELIEVES

THAT IT IS USEFUL AND APPROPRIATE TO HAVE MEMBERS OF MANAGEMENT,

INCLUDING THE CEO, AS DIRECTORS.

THE CURRENT BOARD MEMBERS INCLUDE NINE INDEPENDENT DIRECTORS AND

TWO MEMBERS OF INTELS SENIOR MANAGEMENT. THE BOARD MEMBERS

ARE CRAIG R. BARRETT, INTELS CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD;

AMBASSADOR CHARLENE BARSHEFSKY, SENIOR INTERNATIONAL PARTNER AT

THE WILMER CUTLER PICKERING HALE AND DORR LLP LAW FIRM; E. JOHN

P. BROWNE, GROUP CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF BP PLC; D. JAMES GUZY,

CHAIRMAN OF ARBOR COMPANY; REED E. HUNDT, PRINCIPAL, CHARLES

ROSS PARTNERS, LLC; PAUL S. OTELLINI, INTELS CHIEF

EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND PRESIDENT; JAMES D. PLUMMER, JOHN M. FLUKE

PROFESSOR OF ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING, FREDERICK E. TERMAN DEAN OF

THE SCHOOL OF ENGINEERING, STANFORD UNIVERSITY; DAVID S.

POTTRUCK, CHAIRMAN AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER OF RED EAGLE

VENTURES, INC. AND CHAIRMAN OF EOS AIRLINES; JANE E. SHAW,

RETIRED CHAIRMAN AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER OF AEROGEN, INC.;

JOHN L. THORNTON, PROFESSOR AND DIRECTOR OF GLOBAL LEADERSHIP AT

TSINGHUA UNIVERSITY, BEIJING, CHINA; AND DAVID B. YOFFIE, MAX

AND DORIS STARR PROFESSOR OF INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS

ADMINISTRATION, HARVARD BUSINESS SCHOOL. THE BOARD ALSO HAS ONE

DIRECTOR EMERITUS, GORDON E. MOORE, WHO MAY PARTICIPATE IN BOARD

MEETINGS BUT DOES NOT VOTE.

DIRECTOR CHANGES IN 2005.

AT THE 2005 ANNUAL MEETING,

ANDREW S. GROVE RETIRED FROM THE BOARD. CRAIG R. BARRETT

SUCCEEDED DR. GROVE AS CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD, AND PAUL S.

OTELLINI SUCCEEDED DR. BARRETT AS CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER.

IN JULY 2005, THE BOARD ELECTED JAMES D. PLUMMER TO THE BOARD.

ADOPTION OF MAJORITY VOTE STANDARD FOR ELECTION OF

DIRECTORS.

ON JANUARY 18, 2006, THE BOARD APPROVED AN

AMENDMENT TO ARTICLE III, SECTION 1 OF INTELS

BYLAWS TO REQUIRE DIRECTORS TO BE ELECTED BY A MAJORITY OF THE

VOTES CAST WITH RESPECT TO SUCH DIRECTOR IN UNCONTESTED

ELECTIONS (NUMBER OF SHARES VOTED FOR A DIRECTOR

MUST EXCEED THE NUMBER OF VOTES CAST AGAINST THAT DIRECTOR). IN

A CONTESTED ELECTION (A SITUATION IN WHICH THE NUMBER OF

NOMINEES EXCEEDS THE NUMBER OF DIRECTORS TO BE ELECTED), THE

STANDARD FOR ELECTION OF DIRECTORS WILL BE A PLURALITY OF THE

SHARES REPRESENTED IN PERSON OR BY PROXY AT ANY SUCH MEETING AND

ENTITLED TO VOTE ON THE ELECTION OF DIRECTORS. IF A NOMINEE WHO

IS SERVING AS A DIRECTOR IS NOT ELECTED AT THE ANNUAL MEETING,

UNDER DELAWARE LAW THE DIRECTOR WOULD CONTINUE TO SERVE ON THE

BOARD AS A HOLDOVER DIRECTOR. HOWEVER, UNDER OUR

BYLAWS, ANY DIRECTOR WHO FAILS TO BE ELECTED MUST OFFER TO

TENDER HIS OR HER RESIGNATION TO THE BOARD. THE CORPORATE

GOVERNANCE AND NOMINATING COMMITTEE WOULD THEN MAKE A

RECOMMENDATION TO THE BOARD WHETHER TO ACCEPT OR REJECT THE

RESIGNATION, OR WHETHER OTHER ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN. THE BOARD

WILL ACT ON THE CORPORATE GOVERNANCE AND NOMINATING

COMMITTEES RECOMMENDATION AND PUBLICLY DISCLOSE ITS

DECISION AND THE RATIONALE BEHIND IT WITHIN 90 DAYS FROM

THE DATE THE ELECTION RESULTS ARE CERTIFIED. THE DIRECTOR WHO

TENDERS HIS OR HER RESIGNATION WILL NOT PARTICIPATE IN THE

BOARDS DECISION. IF A NOMINEE WHO WAS NOT ALREADY SERVING

AS A DIRECTOR IS NOT ELECTED AT THE ANNUAL MEETING, UNDER

DELAWARE LAW THAT NOMINEE WOULD NOT BECOME A DIRECTOR AND WOULD

NOT CONTINUE TO SERVE ON THE BOARD AS A HOLDOVER

DIRECTOR. IN 2006, ALL NOMINEES FOR THE ELECTION OF

DIRECTORS ARE CURRENTLY SERVING ON THE BOARD.

FOR MORE INFORMATION ON OUR CORPORATE GOVERNANCE, PLEASE SEE THE

SECTIONS OF OUR PROXY STATEMENT FOR OUR 2006 ANNUAL

STOCKHOLDERS MEETING UNDER THE HEADINGS THE BOARD,

BOARD COMMITTEES AND MEETINGS AND CORPORATE

GOVERNANCE GUIDELINES, WHICH ARE INCORPORATED HEREIN BY

TABLE OF CONTENTS

ITEM 1A.   RISK FACTORS

FLUCTUATIONS IN DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS MAY ADVERSELY

AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS.

IF DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS FLUCTUATES, OUR REVENUE AND GROSS

MARGIN COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED. IMPORTANT FACTORS THAT COULD

CAUSE DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS TO FLUCTUATE INCLUDE.



CHANGES IN CUSTOMER PRODUCT NEEDS;



CHANGES IN THE LEVEL OF CUSTOMERS INVENTORY;



CHANGES IN BUSINESS AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, INCLUDING A

DOWNTURN IN THE SEMICONDUCTOR INDUSTRY;



COMPETITIVE PRESSURES FROM COMPANIES THAT HAVE COMPETING

PRODUCTS, CHIP ARCHITECTURES AND MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGIES;



STRATEGIC ACTIONS TAKEN BY OUR COMPETITORS; AND



MARKET ACCEPTANCE OF OUR PRODUCTS.

IF DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS IS REDUCED, OUR MANUFACTURING AND/OR

ASSEMBLY AND TEST CAPACITY COULD BE UNDER-UTILIZED, AND WE MAY

BE REQUIRED TO RECORD AN IMPAIRMENT ON OUR LONG-LIVED ASSETS

INCLUDING FACILITIES AND EQUIPMENT, AS WELL AS INTANGIBLE

ASSETS, WHICH WOULD INCREASE OUR EXPENSES. IN ADDITION, FACTORY

PLANNING DECISIONS MAY CAUSE US TO RECORD ACCELERATED

DEPRECIATION. IN THE LONG TERM, IF DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS

INCREASES, WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO ADD MANUFACTURING AND/OR

ASSEMBLY AND TEST CAPACITY FAST ENOUGH TO MEET MARKET DEMAND.

THESE CHANGES IN DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS, AND CHANGES IN OUR

CUSTOMERS PRODUCT NEEDS, COULD HAVE A VARIETY OF NEGATIVE

EFFECTS ON OUR COMPETITIVE POSITION AND OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS,

AND, IN CERTAIN CASES, MAY REDUCE OUR REVENUE, INCREASE OUR

COSTS, LOWER OUR GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE, OR REQUIRE US TO

RECOGNIZE AND RECORD IMPAIRMENTS OF OUR ASSETS.

THE SEMICONDUCTOR INDUSTRY AND OUR OPERATIONS ARE

CHARACTERIZED BY A HIGH PERCENTAGE OF COSTS THAT ARE FIXED OR

OTHERWISE DIFFICULT TO REDUCE IN THE SHORT TERM, AND BY PRODUCT

DEMAND THAT IS HIGHLY VARIABLE AND IS SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT

DOWNTURNS THAT MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

THE SEMICONDUCTOR INDUSTRY AND OUR OPERATIONS ARE CHARACTERIZED

BY HIGH COSTS, SUCH AS THOSE RELATED TO FACILITY CONSTRUCTION

AND EQUIPMENT, RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, AND EMPLOYMENT AND

TRAINING OF A HIGHLY SKILLED WORKFORCE, THAT ARE EITHER FIXED OR

DIFFICULT TO REDUCE IN THE SHORT TERM. AT THE SAME TIME, DEMAND

FOR OUR PRODUCTS IS HIGHLY VARIABLE AND HAS EXPERIENCED

DOWNTURNS, OFTEN IN CONNECTION WITH MATURING PRODUCT CYCLES AND

DOWNTURNS IN GENERAL ECONOMIC MARKET CONDITIONS. THESE DOWNTURNS

HAVE BEEN CHARACTERIZED BY REDUCED PRODUCT DEMAND, MANUFACTURING

OVERCAPACITY, HIGH INVENTORY LEVELS AND DECREASED AVERAGE

SELLING PRICES. THE COMBINATION OF THESE FACTORS MAY CAUSE OUR

REVENUE, GROSS MARGIN, CASH FLOW AND PROFITABILITY TO VARY

SIGNIFICANTLY BOTH IN THE SHORT TERM AND OVER THE LONG TERM.

WE OPERATE IN INTENSELY COMPETITIVE INDUSTRIES, AND OUR

FAILURE TO RESPOND QUICKLY TO TECHNOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENTS AND

INCORPORATE NEW FEATURES INTO OUR PRODUCTS COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE

EFFECT ON OUR ABILITY TO COMPETE.

WE OPERATE IN INTENSELY COMPETITIVE INDUSTRIES THAT EXPERIENCE

RAPID TECHNOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENTS, CHANGES IN INDUSTRY STANDARDS,

CHANGES IN CUSTOMER REQUIREMENTS, AND FREQUENT NEW PRODUCT

INTRODUCTIONS AND IMPROVEMENTS. IF WE ARE UNABLE TO RESPOND

QUICKLY AND SUCCESSFULLY TO THESE DEVELOPMENTS, WE MAY LOSE OUR

COMPETITIVE POSITION, AND OUR PRODUCTS OR TECHNOLOGIES MAY

BECOME UNCOMPETITIVE OR OBSOLETE. TO COMPETE SUCCESSFULLY, WE

MUST MAINTAIN A SUCCESSFUL R&D EFFORT, DEVELOP NEW PRODUCTS

AND PRODUCTION PROCESSES, AND IMPROVE OUR EXISTING PRODUCTS AND

PROCESSES AT THE SAME PACE OR AHEAD OF OUR COMPETITORS. WE MAY

NOT BE ABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY DEVELOP AND MARKET THESE NEW

PRODUCTS; THE PRODUCTS WE INVEST IN AND DEVELOP MAY NOT BE WELL

RECEIVED BY CUSTOMERS; AND PRODUCTS DEVELOPED AND NEW

TECHNOLOGIES OFFERED BY OTHERS MAY AFFECT THE DEMAND FOR OUR

PRODUCTS. THESE TYPES OF EVENTS COULD HAVE A VARIETY OF NEGATIVE

EFFECTS ON OUR COMPETITIVE POSITION AND OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS,

SUCH AS REDUCING OUR REVENUE, INCREASING OUR COSTS, LOWERING OUR

GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE, AND REQUIRING US TO RECOGNIZE AND

RECORD IMPAIRMENTS OF OUR ASSETS.

18

TABLE OF CONTENTS

FLUCTUATIONS IN THE MIX OF PRODUCTS SOLD MAY ADVERSELY

AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS.

BECAUSE OF THE WIDE PRICE DIFFERENCES AMONG MOBILE, DESKTOP AND

SERVER MICROPROCESSORS, THE MIX AND TYPES OF PERFORMANCE

CAPABILITIES OF MICROPROCESSORS SOLD AFFECT THE AVERAGE SELLING

PRICE OF OUR PRODUCTS AND HAVE A SUBSTANTIAL IMPACT ON OUR

REVENUE. OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS ALSO DEPEND IN PART ON THE MIX OF

OTHER PRODUCTS WE SELL, SUCH AS CHIPSETS, FLASH MEMORY AND OTHER

SEMICONDUCTOR PRODUCTS. IN ADDITION, MORE RECENTLY INTRODUCED

PRODUCTS TEND TO HAVE HIGHER ASSOCIATED COSTS BECAUSE OF INITIAL

OVERALL DEVELOPMENT COSTS AND HIGHER

START-UP

COSTS.

FLUCTUATIONS IN THE MIX AND TYPES OF OUR PRODUCTS MAY ALSO

AFFECT THE EXTENT TO WHICH WE ARE ABLE TO RECOVER OUR FIXED

COSTS AND INVESTMENTS THAT ARE ASSOCIATED WITH A PARTICULAR

PRODUCT, AND AS A RESULT CAN NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR FINANCIAL

RESULTS.

OUR GLOBAL OPERATIONS SUBJECT US TO RISKS THAT MAY

NEGATIVELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL

CONDITION.

WE HAVE SALES OFFICES AND RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT,

MANUFACTURING, AND ASSEMBLY AND TEST FACILITIES IN MANY

COUNTRIES, AND AS A RESULT, WE ARE SUBJECT TO RISKS ASSOCIATED

WITH DOING BUSINESS GLOBALLY. OUR GLOBAL OPERATIONS MAY BE

SUBJECT TO RISKS THAT MAY LIMIT OUR ABILITY TO MANUFACTURE,

ASSEMBLE AND TEST, DESIGN, DEVELOP OR SELL PRODUCTS IN

PARTICULAR COUNTRIES, WHICH COULD IN TURN HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT

ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION, INCLUDING.



HEALTH CONCERNS;



NATURAL DISASTERS;



INEFFICIENT AND LIMITED INFRASTRUCTURE AND DISRUPTIONS, SUCH AS

LARGE-SCALE OUTAGES OR INTERRUPTIONS OF SERVICE FROM UTILITIES

OR TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROVIDERS AND SUPPLY CHAIN INTERRUPTIONS;



DIFFERING EMPLOYMENT PRACTICES AND LABOR ISSUES;



LOCAL BUSINESS AND CULTURAL FACTORS THAT DIFFER FROM OUR NORMAL

STANDARDS AND PRACTICES;



REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS AND PROHIBITIONS THAT DIFFER BETWEEN

JURISDICTIONS;



SECURITY CONCERNS, INCLUDING CRIME, POLITICAL INSTABILITY,

TERRORIST ACTIVITY, ARMED CONFLICT AND CIVIL OR MILITARY

UNREST; AND



RESTRICTIONS ON OUR OPERATIONS BY GOVERNMENTS SEEKING TO SUPPORT

LOCAL INDUSTRIES, NATIONALIZATION OF OUR OPERATIONS AND

RESTRICTIONS ON OUR ABILITY TO REPATRIATE EARNINGS.

IN ADDITION, ALTHOUGH MOST OF OUR PRODUCTS ARE PRICED AND PAID

FOR IN U.S. DOLLARS, A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF CERTAIN TYPES

OF EXPENSES, SUCH AS PAYROLL, UTILITIES, TAX AND MARKETING

EXPENSES, ARE PAID IN LOCAL CURRENCIES. FLUCTUATIONS IN THE RATE

OF EXCHANGE BETWEEN THE U.S. DOLLAR AND THE CURRENCIES OF

OTHER COUNTRIES IN WHICH WE CONDUCT BUSINESS, AND CHANGES IN

CURRENCY CONTROLS WITH RESPECT TO SUCH COUNTRIES, COULD

NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR BUSINESS, OPERATING RESULTS AND FINANCIAL

CONDITION BY RESULTING IN LOWER REVENUE OR INCREASED EXPENSES IN

SUCH COUNTRIES. IN ADDITION, CHANGES IN TARIFF AND IMPORT

REGULATIONS AND TO U.S. AND

NON-U.S.

MONETARY

POLICIES MAY ALSO NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR REVENUE IN THOSE

AFFECTED COUNTRIES. VARYING TAX RATES IN DIFFERENT JURISDICTIONS

COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR OVERALL TAX RATE.

FAILURE TO MEET OUR PRODUCTION TARGETS, RESULTING IN

UNDERSUPPLY OR OVERSUPPLY OF PRODUCTS, MAY ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR

BUSINESS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

MANUFACTURING AND ASSEMBLY AND TEST OF INTEGRATED CIRCUITS IS A

COMPLEX PROCESS. DISRUPTIONS IN THIS PROCESS CAN RESULT FROM

DIFFICULTIES IN OUR DEVELOPMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION OF NEW

PROCESSES, ERRORS AND INTERRUPTIONS IN THE PROCESSES, DEFECTS IN

MATERIALS AND DISRUPTIONS IN OUR SUPPLY OF MATERIALS OR

RESOURCES, ALL OF WHICH COULD AFFECT THE TIMING OF PRODUCTION

RAMPS AND YIELDS. FURTHERMORE, WE MAY NOT BE SUCCESSFUL OR

EFFICIENT IN DEVELOPING OR IMPLEMENTING NEW PRODUCTION

PROCESSES. THE OCCURRENCE OF ANY OF THE FOREGOING MAY RESULT IN

OUR FAILURE TO INCREASE PRODUCTION AS DESIRED, RESULTING IN

HIGHER COSTS OR SUBSTANTIAL DECREASES IN YIELDS, WHICH COULD

IMPACT OUR ABILITY TO PRODUCE SUFFICIENT VOLUME TO MEET SPECIFIC

PRODUCT DEMAND. FURTHERMORE, THE UNAVAILABILITY OR REDUCED

AVAILABILITY OF CERTAIN PRODUCTS COULD MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT TO

IMPLEMENT OUR PLATFORM STRATEGY. WE MAY ALSO EXPERIENCE

INCREASES IN YIELDS. A SUBSTANTIAL INCREASE IN YIELDS COULD

RESULT IN HIGHER INVENTORY LEVELS AND THE POSSIBILITY OF

RESULTING EXCESS CAPACITY CHARGES AS WE SLOW PRODUCTION TO

REDUCE INVENTORY LEVELS. IN ADDITION, HIGHER YIELDS, AS WELL AS

OTHER FACTORS, CAN DECREASE OVERALL UNIT COSTS AND MAY CAUSE US

TO REVALUE OUR EXISTING INVENTORY ON CERTAIN PRODUCTS TO THEIR

LOWER REPLACEMENT COST, WHICH WOULD IMPACT OUR GROSS MARGIN IN

THE QUARTERS IN WHICH THIS REVALUATION OCCURS. THE OCCURRENCE OF

ANY OF THESE EVENTS COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR BUSINESS AND

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

WE MAY HAVE DIFFICULTIES OBTAINING THE RESOURCES OR

PRODUCTS WE NEED FOR MANUFACTURING OR ASSEMBLING OUR PRODUCTS OR

OPERATING OTHER ASPECTS OF OUR BUSINESS, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY

AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO MEET DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS AND MAY

INCREASE OUR COSTS.

WE HAVE THOUSANDS OF SUPPLIERS PROVIDING VARIOUS MATERIALS THAT

WE USE IN PRODUCTION OF OUR PRODUCTS AND OTHER ASPECTS OF OUR

BUSINESS, AND WE SEEK, WHERE POSSIBLE, TO HAVE SEVERAL SOURCES

OF SUPPLY FOR ALL OF THESE MATERIALS. HOWEVER, WE MAY RELY ON A

SINGLE OR A LIMITED NUMBER OF SUPPLIERS, OR UPON SUPPLIERS IN A

SINGLE COUNTRY, FOR THESE MATERIALS. THE INABILITY OF SUCH

SUPPLIERS TO DELIVER ADEQUATE SUPPLIES OF PRODUCTION MATERIALS

OR OTHER SUPPLIES COULD DISRUPT OUR PRODUCTION PROCESS OR COULD

MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR US TO IMPLEMENT OUR PLATFORM

STRATEGY. IN ADDITION, PRODUCTION COULD BE DISRUPTED BY THE

UNAVAILABILITY OF THE RESOURCES USED IN PRODUCTION SUCH AS

WATER, SILICON, ELECTRICITY AND GASES. THE UNAVAILABILITY OR

REDUCED AVAILABILITY OF THE MATERIALS OR RESOURCES WE USE IN OUR

BUSINESS MAY REQUIRE US TO REDUCE PRODUCTION OF PRODUCTS OR MAY

REQUIRE US TO INCUR ADDITIONAL COSTS IN ORDER TO OBTAIN AN

ADEQUATE SUPPLY OF THESE MATERIALS OR RESOURCES. THE OCCURRENCE

OF ANY OF THESE EVENTS COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR BUSINESS AND

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

19

TABLE OF CONTENTS

COSTS RELATED TO PRODUCT DEFECTS AND ERRATA MAY HAVE AN

ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND BUSINESS.

COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH UNEXPECTED PRODUCT DEFECTS AND ERRATA

(DEVIATIONS FROM PUBLISHED SPECIFICATIONS) INCLUDE, FOR EXAMPLE,

THE COSTS OF.



WRITING DOWN THE VALUE OF INVENTORY OF DEFECTIVE PRODUCTS;



DISPOSING OF DEFECTIVE PRODUCTS THAT CANNOT BE FIXED;



RECALLING DEFECTIVE PRODUCTS THAT HAVE BEEN SHIPPED TO CUSTOMERS;



PROVIDING PRODUCT REPLACEMENTS FOR OR MODIFICATIONS TO DEFECTIVE

PRODUCTS; AND



DEFENDING AGAINST LITIGATION RELATED TO DEFECTIVE PRODUCTS.

THESE COSTS COULD BE SUBSTANTIAL AND MAY THEREFORE INCREASE OUR

EXPENSES AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR GROSS MARGIN. IN ADDITION, OUR

REPUTATION WITH OUR CUSTOMERS OR END USERS OF OUR PRODUCTS COULD

BE DAMAGED AS A RESULT OF SUCH PRODUCT DEFECTS AND ERRATA, AND

THE DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS COULD BE REDUCED. THESE FACTORS

COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS AND THE PROSPECTS

FOR OUR BUSINESS.

WE MAY BE SUBJECT TO CLAIMS OF INFRINGEMENT OF THIRD-PARTY

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR

BUSINESS.

FROM TIME TO TIME, THIRD PARTIES MAY ASSERT AGAINST US OR OUR

CUSTOMERS ALLEGED PATENT, COPYRIGHT, TRADEMARK AND OTHER

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS TO TECHNOLOGIES THAT ARE IMPORTANT

TO OUR BUSINESS. WE MAY BE SUBJECT TO INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

INFRINGEMENT CLAIMS FROM CERTAIN INDIVIDUALS AND COMPANIES WHO

HAVE ACQUIRED PATENT PORTFOLIOS FOR THE SOLE PURPOSE OF

ASSERTING SUCH CLAIMS AGAINST OTHER COMPANIES. ANY CLAIMS THAT

OUR PRODUCTS OR PROCESSES INFRINGE THE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

RIGHTS OF OTHERS, REGARDLESS OF THE MERIT OR RESOLUTION OF SUCH

CLAIMS, COULD CAUSE US TO INCUR SIGNIFICANT COSTS IN RESPONDING

TO, DEFENDING AND RESOLVING SUCH CLAIMS, AND MAY DIVERT THE

EFFORTS AND ATTENTION OF OUR MANAGEMENT AND TECHNICAL PERSONNEL

AWAY FROM OUR BUSINESS. AS A RESULT OF SUCH INTELLECTUAL

PROPERTY INFRINGEMENT CLAIMS, WE COULD BE REQUIRED TO.



PAY THIRD-PARTY INFRINGEMENT CLAIMS;



DISCONTINUE MANUFACTURING, USING OR SELLING THE INFRINGING

PRODUCTS;



DISCONTINUE USING THE INFRINGING TECHNOLOGY OR PROCESSES;



DEVELOP NON-INFRINGING TECHNOLOGY, WHICH COULD BE TIME-CONSUMING

AND COSTLY OR MAY NOT BE POSSIBLE; OR



LICENSE TECHNOLOGY FROM THE THIRD PARTY CLAIMING INFRINGEMENT,

WHICH LICENSE MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE ON COMMERCIALLY REASONABLE

TERMS OR AT ALL.

THE OCCURRENCE OF ANY OF THE FOREGOING COULD RESULT IN

UNEXPECTED EXPENSES OR REQUIRE US TO RECOGNIZE AN IMPAIRMENT OF

OUR ASSETS, WHICH WOULD REDUCE THE VALUE OF OUR ASSETS AND

INCREASE EXPENSES. IN ADDITION, IF WE ALTER OR DISCONTINUE OUR

PRODUCTION OF AFFECTED ITEMS, OUR REVENUE COULD BE NEGATIVELY

IMPACTED.

WE MAY BE SUBJECT TO LITIGATION PROCEEDINGS THAT COULD

ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS.

IN ADDITION TO THE LITIGATION RISKS MENTIONED ABOVE, WE MAY BE

SUBJECT TO LEGAL CLAIMS OR REGULATORY MATTERS INVOLVING

STOCKHOLDER, CONSUMER, ANTITRUST AND OTHER ISSUES. AS DESCRIBED

IN LEGAL PROCEEDINGS IN PART I, ITEM 3 OF

THIS FORM 10-K, WE ARE CURRENTLY ENGAGED IN A NUMBER OF

LITIGATION MATTERS. LITIGATION IS SUBJECT TO INHERENT

UNCERTAINTIES, AND UNFAVORABLE RULINGS COULD OCCUR. AN

UNFAVORABLE RULING COULD INCLUDE MONEY DAMAGES OR, IN CASES FOR

WHICH INJUNCTIVE RELIEF IS SOUGHT, AN INJUNCTION PROHIBITING

INTEL FROM MANUFACTURING OR SELLING ONE OR MORE PRODUCTS. WERE

AN UNFAVORABLE RULING TO OCCUR, THERE EXISTS THE POSSIBILITY OF

A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON BUSINESS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

FOR THE PERIOD IN WHICH THE RULING OCCURRED OR FUTURE PERIODS.

WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO ENFORCE OR PROTECT OUR INTELLECTUAL

PROPERTY RIGHTS, WHICH MAY HARM OUR ABILITY TO COMPETE AND

ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS.

OUR ABILITY TO ENFORCE OUR PATENTS, COPYRIGHTS, SOFTWARE

LICENSES AND OTHER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY IS SUBJECT TO GENERAL

LITIGATION RISKS, AS WELL AS UNCERTAINTY AS TO THE

ENFORCEABILITY OF OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS IN VARIOUS

COUNTRIES. WHEN WE SEEK TO ENFORCE OUR RIGHTS, WE ARE OFTEN

SUBJECT TO CLAIMS THAT THE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHT IS

INVALID, IS OTHERWISE NOT ENFORCEABLE OR IS LICENSED TO THE

PARTY AGAINST WHOM WE ARE ASSERTING A CLAIM. IN ADDITION, OUR

ASSERTION OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS OFTEN RESULTS IN THE

OTHER PARTY SEEKING TO ASSERT ALLEGED INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

RIGHTS OF ITS OWN AGAINST US, WHICH MAY ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR

BUSINESS IN THE MANNER DISCUSSED ABOVE. IF WE ARE NOT ULTIMATELY

SUCCESSFUL IN DEFENDING OURSELVES AGAINST THESE CLAIMS IN

LITIGATION, WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO SELL A PARTICULAR PRODUCT OR

FAMILY OF PRODUCTS, DUE TO AN INJUNCTION, OR WE MAY HAVE TO PAY

MATERIAL AMOUNTS OF DAMAGES, WHICH COULD IN TURN NEGATIVELY

AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. IN ADDITION, GOVERNMENTS MAY

ADOPT REGULATIONS OR COURTS MAY RENDER DECISIONS REQUIRING

COMPULSORY LICENSING OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY TO OTHERS, OR

GOVERNMENTS MAY REQUIRE THAT PRODUCTS MEET SPECIFIED STANDARDS

THAT SERVE TO FAVOR LOCAL COMPANIES. OUR INABILITY TO ENFORCE

OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES MAY

NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR COMPETITIVE POSITION AND OUR BUSINESS.

20

TABLE OF CONTENTS

OUR LICENSES WITH OTHER COMPANIES AND OUR PARTICIPATION IN

INDUSTRY INITIATIVES MAY ALLOW OTHER COMPANIES, INCLUDING

COMPETITORS, TO USE OUR PATENT RIGHTS.

COMPANIES IN THE SEMICONDUCTOR INDUSTRY OFTEN RELY ON THE

ABILITY TO LICENSE PATENTS FROM EACH OTHER IN ORDER TO COMPETE.

MANY OF OUR COMPETITORS HAVE BROAD LICENSES OR CROSS-LICENSES

WITH US, AND UNDER CURRENT CASE LAW, SOME OF THESE LICENSES MAY

PERMIT THESE COMPETITORS TO PASS OUR PATENT RIGHTS ON TO OTHERS.

IF ONE OF THESE LICENSEES BECOMES A FOUNDRY, OUR COMPETITORS

MIGHT BE ABLE TO AVOID OUR PATENT RIGHTS IN MANUFACTURING

COMPETING PRODUCTS. IN ADDITION, OUR PARTICIPATION IN INDUSTRY

INITIATIVES MAY REQUIRE US TO LICENSE OUR PATENTS TO OTHER

COMPANIES THAT ADOPT CERTAIN INDUSTRY STANDARDS OR

SPECIFICATIONS, EVEN WHEN SUCH ORGANIZATIONS DO NOT ADOPT

STANDARDS OR SPECIFICATIONS PROPOSED BY US. AS A RESULT, OUR

PATENTS IMPLICATED BY OUR PARTICIPATION IN INDUSTRY INITIATIVES

MIGHT NOT BE AVAILABLE FOR US TO ENFORCE AGAINST OTHERS WHO

MIGHT OTHERWISE BE DEEMED TO BE INFRINGING THOSE PATENTS, OUR

COSTS OF ENFORCING OUR LICENSES OR PROTECTING OUR PATENTS MAY

INCREASE, AND THE VALUE OF OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY MAY BE

IMPAIRED.

IN ORDER TO COMPETE, WE MUST ATTRACT, RETAIN AND MOTIVATE

KEY EMPLOYEES, AND OUR FAILURE TO DO SO COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE

EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

IN ORDER TO COMPETE, WE MUST ATTRACT, RETAIN AND MOTIVATE

EXECUTIVES AND OTHER KEY EMPLOYEES, INCLUDING THOSE IN

MANAGERIAL, TECHNICAL, SALES, MARKETING AND SUPPORT POSITIONS.

HIRING AND RETAINING QUALIFIED EXECUTIVES, SCIENTISTS,

ENGINEERS, TECHNICAL STAFF AND SALES REPRESENTATIVES ARE

CRITICAL TO OUR BUSINESS, AND COMPETITION FOR EXPERIENCED

EMPLOYEES IN THE SEMICONDUCTOR INDUSTRY CAN BE INTENSE. TO

ATTRACT, RETAIN AND MOTIVATE QUALIFIED EMPLOYEES, WE RELY

HEAVILY ON STOCK-BASED INCENTIVE AWARDS SUCH AS EMPLOYEE STOCK

OPTIONS AND RESTRICTED STOCK. IF THE VALUE OF SUCH STOCK AWARDS

DOES NOT APPRECIATE AS MEASURED BY THE PERFORMANCE OF THE PRICE

OF OUR COMMON STOCK AND/OR IF OUR OTHER STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION

OTHERWISE CEASES TO BE VIEWED AS A VALUABLE BENEFIT, OUR ABILITY

TO ATTRACT, RETAIN AND MOTIVATE OUR EMPLOYEES COULD BE ADVERSELY

IMPACTED, WHICH COULD NEGATIVELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS AND/OR REQUIRE US TO INCREASE THE AMOUNT WE EXPEND ON

CASH AND OTHER FORMS OF COMPENSATION. IN ADDITION, OUR ADOPTION

OF STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS (SFAS)

NO. 123 (REVISED 2004), SHARE-BASED PAYMENT,

DURING OUR FIRST QUARTER OF 2006 WILL RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT

ADDITIONAL COMPENSATION EXPENSE COMPARED TO PRIOR PERIODS.

OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COULD VARY AS A RESULT OF THE

METHODS, ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS WE USE IN APPLYING OUR

ACCOUNTING POLICIES.

THE METHODS, ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS WE USE IN APPLYING OUR

ACCOUNTING POLICIES HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON OUR RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS (SEE CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES IN

PART II, ITEM 7 OF THIS

FORM

10-K).

SUCH

METHODS, ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS ARE, BY THEIR NATURE, SUBJECT

TO SUBSTANTIAL RISKS, UNCERTAINTIES AND ASSUMPTIONS, AND FACTORS

MAY ARISE OVER TIME THAT LEAD US TO CHANGE OUR METHODS,

ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS. CHANGES IN THOSE METHODS, ESTIMATES AND

JUDGMENTS COULD SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

IN PARTICULAR, BEGINNING IN OUR FIRST QUARTER OF 2006, THE

CALCULATION OF SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE UNDER

SFAS NO. 123(R) WILL REQUIRE US TO USE VALUATION

METHODOLOGIES (WHICH WERE NOT DEVELOPED FOR USE IN VALUING

EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTIONS) AND A NUMBER OF ASSUMPTIONS, ESTIMATES

AND CONCLUSIONS REGARDING MATTERS SUCH AS EXPECTED FORFEITURES,

EXPECTED VOLATILITY OF OUR SHARE PRICE, THE EXPECTED DIVIDEND

RATE WITH RESPECT TO OUR COMMON STOCK AND THE EXERCISE BEHAVIOR

OF OUR EMPLOYEES. FURTHERMORE, THERE ARE NO MEANS, UNDER

APPLICABLE ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES, TO COMPARE AND ADJUST OUR

EXPENSE IF AND WHEN WE LEARN OF ADDITIONAL INFORMATION THAT MAY

AFFECT THE ESTIMATES THAT WE PREVIOUSLY MADE, WITH THE EXCEPTION

OF CHANGES IN EXPECTED FORFEITURES OF SHARE-BASED AWARDS.

FACTORS MAY ARISE OVER TIME THAT LEAD US TO CHANGE OUR ESTIMATES

AND ASSUMPTIONS WITH RESPECT TO FUTURE SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION

ARRANGEMENTS, RESULTING IN VARIABILITY IN OUR SHARE-BASED

COMPENSATION EXPENSE OVER TIME. CHANGES IN FORECASTED

SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE COULD IMPACT OUR GROSS MARGIN

PERCENTAGE; RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES; MARKETING,

GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES; AND OUR TAX RATE.

OUR FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH APPLICABLE ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS

AND REGULATIONS WORLDWIDE COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR BUSINESS

AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

THE MANUFACTURE, ASSEMBLY AND TESTING OF OUR PRODUCTS REQUIRE

THE USE OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS THAT ARE SUBJECT TO A BROAD ARRAY

OF ENVIRONMENTAL, HEALTH AND SAFETY LAWS AND REGULATIONS. OUR

FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH ANY OF THESE APPLICABLE LAWS OR

REGULATIONS COULD RESULT IN.



REGULATORY PENALTIES, FINES AND LEGAL LIABILITIES;



SUSPENSION OF PRODUCTION;



ALTERATION OF OUR FABRICATION AND ASSEMBLY AND TEST

PROCESSES; OR



CURTAILMENT OF OUR OPERATIONS OR SALES.

IN ADDITION, OUR FAILURE TO PROPERLY MANAGE THE USE,

TRANSPORTATION, EMISSION, DISCHARGE, STORAGE, RECYCLING OR

DISPOSAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS COULD SUBJECT US TO INCREASED

COSTS OR FUTURE LIABILITIES. EXISTING AND FUTURE ENVIRONMENTAL

LAWS AND REGULATIONS COULD ALSO REQUIRE US TO ACQUIRE POLLUTION

ABATEMENT OR REMEDIATION EQUIPMENT, MODIFY OUR PRODUCT DESIGNS

OR INCUR OTHER EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH SUCH LAWS AND

REGULATIONS. MANY NEW MATERIALS THAT WE ARE EVALUATING FOR USE

IN OUR OPERATIONS MAY BE SUBJECT TO REGULATION UNDER EXISTING OR

FUTURE ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS THAT MAY RESTRICT OUR

USE OF CERTAIN MATERIALS IN OUR MANUFACTURING, ASSEMBLY AND TEST

PROCESSES OR PRODUCTS. ANY OF THESE CONSEQUENCES COULD ADVERSELY

IMPACT OUR BUSINESS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS BY INCREASING OUR

EXPENSES AND/OR REQUIRING US TO ALTER OUR MANUFACTURING

PROCESSES.

21

TABLE OF CONTENTS

CHANGES IN OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE MAY HAVE AN ADVERSE

EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

OUR FUTURE EFFECTIVE TAX RATES MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY A

NUMBER OF FACTORS INCLUDING.



THE JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH PROFITS ARE DETERMINED TO BE EARNED

AND TAXED;



THE REPATRIATION OF

NON-U.S.

EARNINGS

FOR WHICH WE HAVE NOT PREVIOUSLY PROVIDED FOR U.S. TAXES;



ADJUSTMENTS TO ESTIMATED TAXES UPON FINALIZATION OF VARIOUS TAX

RETURNS;



INCREASES IN EXPENSES NOT DEDUCTIBLE FOR TAX PURPOSES, INCLUDING

WRITE-OFFS OF ACQUIRED IN-PROCESS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT AND

IMPAIRMENT OF GOODWILL IN CONNECTION WITH ACQUISITIONS;



CHANGES IN AVAILABLE TAX CREDITS;



CHANGES IN SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE;



CHANGES IN THE VALUATION OF OUR DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND

LIABILITIES;



CHANGES IN TAX LAWS OR THE INTERPRETATION OF SUCH TAX

LAWS; AND



THE RESOLUTION OF ISSUES ARISING FROM TAX AUDITS WITH VARIOUS

TAX AUTHORITIES.

ANY SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN OUR FUTURE EFFECTIVE TAX RATES COULD

ADVERSELY IMPACT NET INCOME FOR FUTURE PERIODS.

IN ADDITION, THE U.S. INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE (IRS) AND

OTHER TAX AUTHORITIES REGULARLY EXAMINE OUR INCOME TAX RETURNS.

THE IRS HAS ISSUED FORMAL ASSESSMENTS RELATED TO AMOUNTS

REFLECTED ON CERTAIN OF OUR TAX RETURNS AS A TAX BENEFIT FOR OUR

EXPORT SALES (SEE NOTE 18: CONTINGENCIES IN

PART II, ITEM 8 OF THIS

FORM

10-K).

OUR

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COULD BE ADVERSELY IMPACTED IF THESE

ASSESSMENTS OR ANY OTHER ASSESSMENTS RESULTING FROM THE

EXAMINATION OF OUR INCOME TAX RETURNS BY THE IRS OR OTHER TAXING

AUTHORITIES ARE NOT RESOLVED IN OUR FAVOR.

WE INVEST IN COMPANIES FOR STRATEGIC REASONS AND MAY NOT

REALIZE A RETURN ON OUR INVESTMENTS.

WE MAKE INVESTMENTS IN COMPANIES AROUND THE WORLD TO FURTHER OUR

STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES AND SUPPORT OUR KEY BUSINESS INITIATIVES.

SUCH INVESTMENTS INCLUDE INVESTMENTS IN EQUITY SECURITIES OF

PUBLIC COMPANIES AND INVESTMENTS IN NON-MARKETABLE EQUITY

SECURITIES OF PRIVATE COMPANIES, WHICH RANGE FROM EARLY-STAGE

COMPANIES THAT ARE OFTEN STILL DEFINING THEIR STRATEGIC

DIRECTION TO MORE MATURE COMPANIES WHOSE PRODUCTS OR

TECHNOLOGIES MAY DIRECTLY SUPPORT AN INTEL PRODUCT OR

INITIATIVE. THE SUCCESS OF THESE COMPANIES (OR LACK THEREOF) IS

DEPENDENT ON PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT, MARKET ACCEPTANCE, OPERATIONAL

EFFICIENCY AND OTHER KEY BUSINESS SUCCESS FACTORS. THE PRIVATE

COMPANIES IN WHICH WE INVEST MAY FAIL BECAUSE THEY MAY NOT BE

ABLE TO SECURE ADDITIONAL FUNDING, OBTAIN FAVORABLE INVESTMENT

TERMS FOR FUTURE FINANCINGS OR TAKE ADVANTAGE OF LIQUIDITY

EVENTS, SUCH AS INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERINGS, MERGERS AND PRIVATE

SALES. IF ANY OF THESE PRIVATE COMPANIES FAIL, WE COULD LOSE ALL

OR PART OF OUR INVESTMENT IN THAT COMPANY. IN ADDITION, IF WE

DETERMINE THAT AN OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY DECLINE IN THE FAIR VALUE

EXISTS FOR THE EQUITY SECURITIES OF THE PUBLIC AND PRIVATE

COMPANIES IN WHICH WE INVEST, WE WRITE DOWN THE INVESTMENT TO

ITS FAIR VALUE AND RECORD THE RELATED WRITE-DOWN AS AN

INVESTMENT LOSS. FURTHERMORE, WHEN THE STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES OF

AN INVESTMENT HAVE BEEN ACHIEVED, OR IF THE INVESTMENT OR

BUSINESS DIVERGES FROM OUR STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES, WE MAY DECIDE

TO DISPOSE OF THE INVESTMENT. OUR INVESTMENTS IN NON-MARKETABLE

EQUITY SECURITIES OF PRIVATE COMPANIES ARE NOT LIQUID, AND WE

MAY NOT BE ABLE TO DISPOSE OF THESE INVESTMENTS ON FAVORABLE

TERMS OR AT ALL. THE OCCURRENCE OF ANY OF THESE EVENTS COULD

NEGATIVELY AFFECT OUR NET INCOME AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

A. TAX MATTERS

IN CONNECTION WITH THE IRSS REGULAR EXAMINATION OF

INTELS TAX RETURNS FOR THE YEARS 1999 AND 2000, THE IRS

FORMALLY ASSESSED IN EARLY 2005 CERTAIN ADJUSTMENTS TO THE

AMOUNTS REFLECTED BY US ON THOSE RETURNS AS A TAX BENEFIT FOR

EXPORT SALES. ALSO IN 2005, THE IRS FORMALLY ASSESSED SIMILAR

ADJUSTMENTS TO THE AMOUNTS REFLECTED BY US FOR THE YEARS 2001

AND 2002 AS A TAX BENEFIT FOR EXPORT SALES. WE DO NOT AGREE WITH

THESE ADJUSTMENTS AND HAVE APPEALED THE ASSESSMENTS. IF THE IRS

PREVAILS IN ITS POSITION, OUR FEDERAL INCOME TAX DUE FOR 1999

THROUGH 2002 WOULD INCREASE BY APPROXIMATELY $1.0 BILLION,

PLUS INTEREST. THE IRS MAY MAKE SIMILAR CLAIMS FOR YEARS

SUBSEQUENT TO 2002 IN FUTURE AUDITS, AND IF THE IRS PREVAILS,

INCOME TAX DUE FOR 2003 THROUGH 2005 WOULD INCREASE BY

APPROXIMATELY $1.2 BILLION, PLUS INTEREST.

ALTHOUGH THE FINAL RESOLUTION OF THE ADJUSTMENTS IS UNCERTAIN,

BASED ON CURRENTLY AVAILABLE INFORMATION, MANAGEMENT BELIEVES

THAT THE ULTIMATE OUTCOME WILL NOT HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE

EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL POSITION, CASH FLOWS OR OVERALL TRENDS

IN RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. THERE IS THE POSSIBILITY OF A MATERIAL

ADVERSE IMPACT ON THE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OF THE PERIOD IN

WHICH THE MATTER IS ULTIMATELY RESOLVED, IF IT IS RESOLVED

UNFAVORABLY, OR IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH AN UNFAVORABLE OUTCOME

BECOMES PROBABLE AND REASONABLY ESTIMABLE.

UNFAVORABLE RULINGS COULD OCCUR. AN UNFAVORABLE RULING COULD

INCLUDE MONEY DAMAGES OR, IN CASES FOR WHICH INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

IS SOUGHT, AN INJUNCTION PROHIBITING INTEL FROM SELLING ONE OR

STATE COURTS. ALL THE FEDERAL CLASS ACTIONS HAVE BEEN

CONSOLIDATED BY THE MULTIDISTRICT LITIGATION PANEL TO THE

DISTRICT OF DELAWARE. ALL CALIFORNIA CLASS ACTIONS HAVE BEEN

CONSOLIDATED TO THE SUPERIOR COURT OF CALIFORNIA IN

SANTA CLARA COUNTY. INTEL DISPUTES AMDS CLAIMS AND

THE CLASS-ACTION CLAIMS, AND INTENDS TO DEFEND THE LAWSUITS

VIGOROUSLY.

INTEL IS ALSO SUBJECT TO CERTAIN ANTITRUST REGULATORY INQUIRIES.

IN 2001, THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION COMMENCED AN INVESTIGATION

REGARDING CLAIMS BY AMD THAT INTEL USED UNFAIR BUSINESS

PRACTICES TO PERSUADE CLIENTS TO BUY INTEL MICROPROCESSORS. IN

JUNE 2005, INTEL RECEIVED AN INQUIRY FROM THE KOREA FAIR TRADE

COMMISSION REQUESTING DOCUMENTS FROM INTELS KOREAN

SUBSIDIARY RELATED TO MARKETING AND REBATE PROGRAMS THAT INTEL

ENTERED INTO WITH KOREAN PC MANUFACTURERS. INTEL IS COOPERATING

WITH THESE AGENCIES IN THEIR INVESTIGATIONS AND EXPECTS THAT

CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (MD&A) WITH INTELS

OVERALL STRATEGY AND THE STRATEGY FOR OUR MAJOR OPERATING

SEGMENTS TO GIVE THE READER AN OVERVIEW OF THE GOALS OF OUR

BUSINESS AND THE DIRECTION IN WHICH OUR BUSINESS AND PRODUCTS

ARE MOVING. THE STRATEGY SECTION IS FOLLOWED BY A DISCUSSION OF

THE CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES THAT WE BELIEVE ARE IMPORTANT

TO UNDERSTANDING THE ASSUMPTIONS AND JUDGMENTS INCORPORATED IN

OUR REPORTED FINANCIAL RESULTS. WE THEN DISCUSS OUR RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS FOR 2005 COMPARED TO 2004, AND FOR 2004 COMPARED TO

2003, BEGINNING WITH AN OVERVIEW. FOLLOWING THE ANALYSIS OF OUR

RESULTS, WE PROVIDE AN ANALYSIS OF CHANGES IN OUR BALANCE SHEET

AND CASH FLOWS, AND DISCUSS OUR FINANCIAL COMMITMENTS IN THE

SECTIONS ENTITLED FINANCIAL CONDITION,

CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND OFF-BALANCE-SHEET

ARRANGEMENTS. WE THEN CONCLUDE THIS MD&A WITH OUR

BUSINESS OUTLOOK SECTION, DISCUSSING OUR OUTLOOK FOR 2006.

THIS MD&A SHOULD BE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE OTHER

SECTIONS OF THIS

FORM

10-K,

INCLUDING PART I, ITEM 1: BUSINESS;

PART II, ITEM 6: SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA;

AND PART II, ITEM 8: FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND

SUPPLEMENTARY DATA. THE VARIOUS SECTIONS OF THIS MD&A

CONTAIN A NUMBER OF FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS, ALL OF WHICH ARE

BASED ON OUR CURRENT EXPECTATIONS AND COULD BE AFFECTED BY THE

UNCERTAINTIES AND RISK FACTORS DESCRIBED THROUGHOUT THIS FILING

AND PARTICULARLY IN PART I, ITEM 1A: RISK

FACTORS AND THE BUSINESS OUTLOOK SECTION. OUR ACTUAL

RESULTS MAY DIFFER MATERIALLY, AND THESE FORWARD-LOOKING

STATEMENTS DO NOT REFLECT THE POTENTIAL IMPACT OF ANY

DIVESTITURES, MERGERS, ACQUISITIONS OR OTHER BUSINESS

COMBINATIONS THAT HAD NOT BEEN COMPLETED AS OF FEBRUARY 22,

2006.

STRATEGY

OUR GOAL IS TO BE THE PREEMINENT PROVIDER OF SILICON CHIPS AND

PLATFORM SOLUTIONS TO THE WORLDWIDE DIGITAL ECONOMY. AS PART OF

OUR OVERALL STRATEGY TO COMPETE IN EACH RELEVANT MARKET SEGMENT,

WE USE OUR CORE COMPETENCIES IN THE DESIGN AND MANUFACTURE OF

INTEGRATED CIRCUITS, AS WELL AS OUR FINANCIAL RESOURCES, GLOBAL

PRESENCE AND BRAND RECOGNITION. OUR PRIMARY FOCUS IS ON

DEVELOPING ADVANCED INTEGRATED SILICON TECHNOLOGY SOLUTIONS.

OUR STRATEGY FOCUSES ON TAKING CUSTOMER NEEDS INTO ACCOUNT IN

DEVELOPING THE NEXT GENERATION OF PRODUCTS AND PLATFORMS THAT

WILL ENABLE NEW FORM FACTORS AND NEW USAGE MODELS FOR BUSINESSES

AND CONSUMERS. WE BELIEVE THAT THE END USERS OF COMPUTING AND

COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEMS AND DEVICES WANT PRODUCTS BASED ON

PLATFORM SOLUTIONS. WE DEFINE A PLATFORM AS A COLLECTION OF

TECHNOLOGIES THAT ARE DESIGNED TO WORK TOGETHER TO PROVIDE A

BETTER END-USER SOLUTION THAN IF THE INGREDIENTS WERE USED

SEPARATELY. OUR PLATFORMS CONSIST OF STANDARDS AND INITIATIVES

SUCH AS WIFI AND WIMAX; HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE THAT MAY INCLUDE

TECHNOLOGIES SUCH AS HT TECHNOLOGY, INTEL VIRTUALIZATION

TECHNOLOGY AND INTEL AMT; AND SERVICES. IN DEVELOPING OUR

PLATFORMS, WE MAY INCLUDE INGREDIENTS SOLD BY OTHER COMPANIES.

THE SUCCESS OF OUR STRATEGY TO OFFER PLATFORM SOLUTIONS IS

DEPENDENT ON OUR ABILITY TO SELECT AND INCORPORATE INGREDIENTS

THAT CUSTOMERS VALUE, AND TO MARKET THE PLATFORMS EFFECTIVELY.

WE ALSO BELIEVE THAT USERS OF COMPUTING AND COMMUNICATIONS

SYSTEMS AND DEVICES WANT IMPROVED OVERALL PERFORMANCE AND/OR

IMPROVED PERFORMANCE PER WATT. IMPROVED OVERALL PERFORMANCE CAN

INCLUDE FASTER PROCESSING PERFORMANCE AND/OR OTHER IMPROVED

CAPABILITIES SUCH AS MULTITHREADING AND/OR MULTITASKING, AND

IMPROVED CONNECTIVITY, SECURITY, MANAGEABILITY, RELIABILITY,

EASE OF USE AND/OR INTEROPERABILITY AMONG DEVICES. IMPROVED

PERFORMANCE PER WATT INVOLVES BALANCING THE ADDITION OF THESE

TYPES OF IMPROVED PERFORMANCE FACTORS WITH THE POWER CONSUMPTION

OF THE PLATFORM. LOWER POWER CONSUMPTION MAY REDUCE SYSTEM HEAT

OUTPUT, PROVIDE POWER SAVINGS, AND REDUCE THE TOTAL COST OF

OWNERSHIP FOR THE END USER. IT IS OUR GOAL TO INCORPORATE THESE

IMPROVEMENTS IN OUR VARIOUS PRODUCTS AND PLATFORMS TO MEET

END-USER DEMANDS. IN LINE WITH THESE EFFORTS, WE ARE FOCUSING

OUR EFFORTS ON DUAL-CORE MICROPROCESSORS. DUAL-CORE

MICROPROCESSORS CONTAIN TWO PROCESSOR CORES, RATHER THAN JUST

ONE PROCESSOR CORE, WHICH ENABLES IMPROVED MULTITASKING WITH

IMPROVED PERFORMANCE PER WATT.

WE MAKE EQUITY INVESTMENTS IN COMPANIES AROUND THE WORLD TO

FURTHER OUR STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES AND SUPPORT OUR KEY BUSINESS

INITIATIVES, INCLUDING INVESTMENTS THROUGH OUR INTEL CAPITAL

PROGRAM. WE GENERALLY FOCUS ON INVESTING IN COMPANIES AND

INITIATIVES TO STIMULATE GROWTH IN THE DIGITAL ECONOMY, CREATE

NEW BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES FOR INTEL AND EXPAND GLOBAL MARKETS

FOR OUR PRODUCTS. THE INVESTMENTS MAY SUPPORT, AMONG OTHER

THINGS, INTEL PRODUCT INITIATIVES, EMERGING TRENDS IN THE

TECHNOLOGY INDUSTRY OR WORLDWIDE INTERNET DEPLOYMENT. WE INVEST

IN COMPANIES THAT DEVELOP SOFTWARE, HARDWARE OR SERVICES

SUPPORTING OUR TECHNOLOGIES. OUR CURRENT INVESTMENT FOCUS AREAS

INCLUDE HELPING TO ENABLE MOBILE WIRELESS DEVICES, ADVANCE THE

DIGITAL HOME, ENHANCE THE DIGITAL ENTERPRISE, ADVANCE

HIGH-PERFORMANCE COMMUNICATIONS INFRASTRUCTURES AND DEVELOP THE

NEXT GENERATION OF SILICON PRODUCTION TECHNOLOGIES. OUR FOCUS

AREAS TEND TO DEVELOP AND CHANGE OVER TIME DUE TO RAPID

ADVANCEMENTS IN TECHNOLOGY.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL

CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

(CONTINUED)

WE PLAN TO CONTINUE TO CULTIVATE NEW BUSINESSES AND WORK WITH

THE COMPUTING, COMMUNICATIONS AND CONSUMER ELECTRONICS

INDUSTRIES THROUGH STANDARDS BODIES, TRADE ASSOCIATIONS, OEMS,

ODMS, AND INDEPENDENT SOFTWARE AND OPERATING SYSTEM VENDORS, TO

ENCOURAGE THE INDUSTRY TO OFFER PRODUCTS THAT TAKE ADVANTAGE OF

THE LATEST MARKET TRENDS AND USAGE MODELS. THESE EFFORTS INCLUDE

HELPING TO EXPAND THE INFRASTRUCTURE FOR WIRELESS CONNECTIVITY,

INCLUDING WIRELESS BROADBAND. WE ALSO PROVIDE DEVELOPMENT TOOLS

AND SUPPORT TO HELP SOFTWARE DEVELOPERS CREATE SOFTWARE

APPLICATIONS AND OPERATING SYSTEMS THAT TAKE ADVANTAGE OF OUR

PLATFORM SOLUTIONS. WE FREQUENTLY PARTICIPATE IN INDUSTRY

INITIATIVES DESIGNED TO DISCUSS AND AGREE UPON TECHNICAL

SPECIFICATIONS AND OTHER ASPECTS OF TECHNOLOGIES THAT COULD BE

ADOPTED AS STANDARDS BY STANDARDS-SETTING ORGANIZATIONS. IN

ADDITION, WE WORK COLLABORATIVELY WITH OTHER COMPANIES TO

PROTECT DIGITAL CONTENT AND THE CONSUMER.

DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2005, WE REORGANIZED OUR OPERATING

SEGMENTS TO BRING ALL MAJOR PRODUCT GROUPS IN LINE WITH OUR

STRATEGY TO DESIGN AND DELIVER TECHNOLOGY PLATFORMS. OUR

OPERATING SEGMENTS AFTER THE FIRST-QUARTER REORGANIZATION

INCLUDED THE DIGITAL ENTERPRISE GROUP, THE MOBILITY GROUP, THE

DIGITAL HOME GROUP, THE DIGITAL HEALTH GROUP AND THE CHANNEL

PLATFORMS GROUP. IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2005, WE ADDED THE

FLASH MEMORY GROUP. THE FLASH MEMORY GROUP OFFERS NOR FLASH

MEMORY PRODUCTS, WHICH WERE PREVIOUSLY REPORTED WITHIN THE

MOBILITY GROUP OPERATING SEGMENT, AND BEGINNING IN 2006, ALSO

OFFERS NAND FLASH MEMORY PRODUCTS THAT WE PURCHASE FROM IMFT.

DIGITAL ENTERPRISE GROUP

THE DIGITAL ENTERPRISE GROUP DESIGNS AND DELIVERS COMPUTING AND

COMMUNICATIONS PLATFORMS FOR BUSINESSES AND SERVICE PROVIDERS.

DEG PRODUCTS ARE INCORPORATED INTO DESKTOP COMPUTERS, THE

INFRASTRUCTURE FOR THE INTERNET AND ENTERPRISE COMPUTING

SERVERS. DEG PLATFORMS FOR BUSINESSES ARE DESIGNED TO INCREASE

EMPLOYEE PRODUCTIVITY AND REDUCE TOTAL COST OF OWNERSHIP. WE

DEVELOP THESE PLATFORMS BASED ON OUR PROCESSORS, CHIPSETS,

BOARD-LEVEL PRODUCTS, WIRED CONNECTIVITY PRODUCTS, AND PRODUCTS

FOR NETWORK AND SERVER STORAGE. THE PROCESSORS OFFERED BY DEG

ARE DESIGNED FOR VARIOUS MARKET SEGMENTS, AND INCLUDE

MICROPROCESSORS THAT ARE OPTIMIZED FOR USE IN THE DESKTOP AND

SERVER COMPUTING MARKET SEGMENTS, AND PRODUCTS DESIGNED FOR THE

COMMUNICATIONS INFRASTRUCTURE, INCLUDING NETWORK PROCESSORS AND

EMBEDDED MICROPROCESSORS. ALTHOUGH DEGS STRATEGIC FOCUS IS

ON BUSINESS PLATFORM SOLUTIONS, THE GROUP ALSO OFFERS PRODUCTS

MARKETED TO THE CONSUMER DESKTOP COMPUTING MARKET SEGMENT.

CONSUMER DESKTOP PLATFORMS THAT ARE DESIGNED AND MARKETED

SPECIFICALLY FOR THE DIGITAL HOME ARE OFFERED BY THE DIGITAL

HOME GROUP.

OUR STRATEGY FOR THE DESKTOP COMPUTING MARKET SEGMENT IS TO

INTRODUCE PLATFORMS WITH IMPROVED PERFORMANCE PER WATT, TAILORED

TO THE NEEDS OF DIFFERENT MARKET SEGMENTS USING A TIERED

BRANDING APPROACH. FOR DESKTOP PERFORMANCE PLATFORMS, WE OFFER

THE INTEL PENTIUM 4 PROCESSOR SUPPORTING

HT TECHNOLOGY, AND THE INTEL PENTIUM D PROCESSOR. IN

ADDITION, CURRENT VERSIONS OF THE INTEL CORE DUO PROCESSOR THAT

WERE ORIGINALLY DESIGNED FOR MOBILE FORM FACTORS ARE ALSO

AVAILABLE FOR SMALL DESKTOP FORM FACTORS. FOR VALUE DESKTOP

PLATFORMS, WE OFFER THE INTEL CELERON PROCESSOR AND THE INTEL

CELERON D PROCESSOR, WHICH ARE DESIGNED TO MEET THE CORE

COMPUTING NEEDS AND AFFORDABILITY REQUIREMENTS OF

VALUE-CONSCIOUS PC USERS. WE ALSO OFFER CHIPSETS DESIGNED AND

OPTIMIZED FOR USE IN DESKTOP PLATFORMS.

OUR STRATEGY FOR THE ENTERPRISE COMPUTING MARKET SEGMENT IS TO

PROVIDE COMPETITIVE PRICE FOR PERFORMANCE IN PLATFORMS THAT

INCREASE END-USER VALUE IN THE AREAS OF POWER MANAGEMENT,

SECURITY, AND MANAGEABILITY FOR ENTRY-LEVEL TO HIGH-END SERVERS

AND WORKSTATIONS. OUR INTEL XEON PROCESSOR FAMILY OF PRODUCTS

SUPPORTS A RANGE OF ENTRY-LEVEL TO HIGH-END TECHNICAL AND

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

THE METHODS, ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS WE USE IN APPLYING OUR

ACCOUNTING POLICIES HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE RESULTS WE

REPORT IN OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, WHICH WE DISCUSS UNDER THE

HEADING RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOLLOWING THIS SECTION

OF OUR MD&A. SOME OF OUR ACCOUNTING POLICIES REQUIRE US TO

MAKE DIFFICULT AND SUBJECTIVE JUDGMENTS, OFTEN AS A RESULT OF

THE NEED TO MAKE ESTIMATES OF MATTERS THAT ARE INHERENTLY

UNCERTAIN. OUR MOST CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES INCLUDE THE

VALUATION OF NON-MARKETABLE EQUITY SECURITIES, WHICH IMPACTS NET

GAINS (LOSSES) ON EQUITY SECURITIES WHEN WE RECORD IMPAIRMENTS;

RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT OF CURRENT AND DEFERRED INCOME TAX

ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, WHICH IMPACT OUR TAX PROVISION;

ASSESSMENT OF RECOVERABILITY OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS, WHICH

PRIMARILY IMPACTS GROSS MARGIN WHEN WE IMPAIR MANUFACTURING

ASSETS OR ACCELERATE THEIR DEPRECIATION; AND VALUATION OF

INVENTORY, WHICH IMPACTS GROSS MARGIN. BELOW, WE DISCUSS THESE

POLICIES FURTHER, AS WELL AS THE ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS

INVOLVED. WE ALSO HAVE OTHER POLICIES THAT WE CONSIDER KEY

ACCOUNTING POLICIES, SUCH AS POLICIES FOR REVENUE RECOGNITION,

INCLUDING THE DEFERRAL OF REVENUE ON SALES TO DISTRIBUTORS;

HOWEVER, THESE POLICIES TYPICALLY DO NOT REQUIRE US TO MAKE

ESTIMATES OR JUDGMENTS THAT ARE DIFFICULT OR SUBJECTIVE.

NON-MARKETABLE EQUITY SECURITIES

WE TYPICALLY INVEST IN NON-MARKETABLE EQUITY SECURITIES OF

PRIVATE COMPANIES, WHICH RANGE FROM EARLY-STAGE COMPANIES THAT

ARE OFTEN STILL DEFINING THEIR STRATEGIC DIRECTION TO MORE

MATURE COMPANIES WHOSE PRODUCTS OR TECHNOLOGIES MAY DIRECTLY

SUPPORT AN INTEL PRODUCT OR INITIATIVE. AT DECEMBER 31,

2005, THE CARRYING VALUE OF OUR PORTFOLIO OF STRATEGIC

INVESTMENTS IN NON-MARKETABLE EQUITY SECURITIES, EXCLUDING

EQUITY DERIVATIVES, TOTALED $561 MILLION ($507 MILLION

AT DECEMBER 25, 2004).

INVESTMENTS IN NON-MARKETABLE EQUITY SECURITIES ARE INHERENTLY

RISKY, AND A NUMBER OF THESE COMPANIES ARE LIKELY TO FAIL. THEIR

SUCCESS (OR LACK THEREOF) IS DEPENDENT ON PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT,

MARKET ACCEPTANCE, OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCY AND OTHER KEY BUSINESS

SUCCESS FACTORS. IN ADDITION, DEPENDING ON THEIR FUTURE

PROSPECTS, THEY MAY NOT BE ABLE TO RAISE ADDITIONAL FUNDS WHEN

NEEDED OR THEY MAY RECEIVE LOWER VALUATIONS, WITH LESS FAVORABLE

INVESTMENT TERMS THAN IN PREVIOUS FINANCINGS, AND THE

INVESTMENTS WOULD LIKELY BECOME IMPAIRED.

WE REVIEW OUR INVESTMENTS QUARTERLY FOR INDICATORS OF

IMPAIRMENT; HOWEVER, FOR NON-MARKETABLE EQUITY SECURITIES, THE

IMPAIRMENT ANALYSIS REQUIRES SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT TO IDENTIFY

EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES THAT WOULD LIKELY HAVE A SIGNIFICANT

ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE FAIR VALUE OF THE INVESTMENT. THE

INDICATORS THAT WE USE TO IDENTIFY THOSE EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES

INCLUDE (A) THE INVESTEES REVENUE AND EARNINGS TRENDS

RELATIVE TO PREDEFINED MILESTONES AND OVERALL BUSINESS

PROSPECTS, (B) THE TECHNOLOGICAL FEASIBILITY OF THE

INVESTEES PRODUCTS AND TECHNOLOGIES, (C) THE GENERAL

MARKET CONDITIONS IN THE INVESTEES INDUSTRY OR GEOGRAPHIC

AREA, INCLUDING ADVERSE REGULATORY OR ECONOMIC CHANGES,

(D) FACTORS RELATED TO THE INVESTEES ABILITY TO

REMAIN IN BUSINESS, SUCH AS THE INVESTEES LIQUIDITY, DEBT

RATIOS AND THE RATE AT WHICH THE INVESTEE IS USING ITS CASH, AND

(E) THE INVESTEES RECEIPT OF ADDITIONAL FUNDING AT A

LOWER VALUATION.

INVESTMENTS IDENTIFIED AS HAVING AN INDICATOR OF IMPAIRMENT ARE

SUBJECT TO FURTHER ANALYSIS TO DETERMINE IF THE INVESTMENT IS

OTHER THAN TEMPORARILY IMPAIRED, IN WHICH CASE WE WRITE THE

INVESTMENT DOWN TO ITS IMPAIRED VALUE. WHEN AN INVESTEE IS NOT

CONSIDERED VIABLE FROM A FINANCIAL OR TECHNOLOGICAL POINT OF

VIEW, WE WRITE DOWN THE ENTIRE INVESTMENT SINCE WE CONSIDER THE

ESTIMATED FAIR MARKET VALUE TO BE NOMINAL. IF AN INVESTEE

OBTAINS ADDITIONAL FUNDING AT A VALUATION LOWER THAN OUR

CARRYING AMOUNT OR REQUIRES A NEW ROUND OF EQUITY FUNDING TO

STAY IN OPERATION AND THE NEW FUNDING DOES NOT APPEAR IMMINENT,

WE PRESUME THAT THE INVESTMENT IS OTHER THAN TEMPORARILY

IMPAIRED, UNLESS SPECIFIC FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE

OTHERWISE. IMPAIRMENTS OF INVESTMENTS IN OUR PORTFOLIO OF

NON-MARKETABLE EQUITY SECURITIES WERE APPROXIMATELY

$103 MILLION IN 2005 ($115 MILLION IN 2004 AND

$319 MILLION IN 2003).

INCOME TAXES

WE MUST MAKE CERTAIN ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS IN DETERMINING

INCOME TAX EXPENSE FOR FINANCIAL STATEMENT PURPOSES. THESE

ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS OCCUR IN THE CALCULATION OF TAX CREDITS,

TAX BENEFITS, AND DEDUCTIONS SUCH AS THE TAX BENEFIT FOR EXPORT

SALES AND IN THE CALCULATION OF CERTAIN TAX ASSETS AND

LIABILITIES, WHICH ARISE FROM DIFFERENCES IN THE TIMING OF

RECOGNITION OF REVENUE AND EXPENSE FOR TAX AND FINANCIAL

STATEMENT PURPOSES. SIGNIFICANT CHANGES TO THESE ESTIMATES MAY

RESULT IN AN INCREASE OR DECREASE TO OUR TAX PROVISION IN A

SUBSEQUENT PERIOD.

WE MUST ASSESS THE LIKELIHOOD THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO RECOVER

OUR DEFERRED TAX ASSETS. IF RECOVERY IS NOT LIKELY, WE MUST

INCREASE OUR PROVISION FOR TAXES BY RECORDING A VALUATION

ALLOWANCE AGAINST THE DEFERRED TAX ASSETS THAT WE ESTIMATE WILL

NOT ULTIMATELY BE RECOVERABLE. WE BELIEVE THAT A SUBSTANTIAL

MAJORITY OF THE DEFERRED TAX ASSETS RECORDED ON OUR BALANCE

SHEET WILL ULTIMATELY BE RECOVERED. HOWEVER, SHOULD THERE BE A

CHANGE IN OUR ABILITY TO RECOVER OUR DEFERRED TAX ASSETS, OUR

TAX PROVISION WOULD INCREASE IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH WE

DETERMINED THAT THE RECOVERY WAS NOT LIKELY.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL

CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

(CONTINUED)

IN ADDITION, THE CALCULATION OF OUR TAX LIABILITIES INVOLVES

DEALING WITH UNCERTAINTIES IN THE APPLICATION OF COMPLEX TAX

REGULATIONS. WE RECOGNIZE LIABILITIES FOR ANTICIPATED TAX AUDIT

ISSUES IN THE U.S. AND OTHER TAX JURISDICTIONS BASED ON OUR

ESTIMATE OF WHETHER, AND THE EXTENT TO WHICH, ADDITIONAL TAX

PAYMENTS ARE PROBABLE. IF WE ULTIMATELY DETERMINE THAT PAYMENT

OF THESE AMOUNTS IS UNNECESSARY, WE REVERSE THE LIABILITY AND

RECOGNIZE A TAX BENEFIT DURING THE PERIOD IN WHICH WE DETERMINE

THAT THE LIABILITY IS NO LONGER NECESSARY. WE RECORD AN

ADDITIONAL CHARGE IN OUR PROVISION FOR TAXES IN THE PERIOD IN

WHICH WE DETERMINE THAT THE RECORDED TAX LIABILITY IS LESS THAN

WE EXPECT THE ULTIMATE ASSESSMENT TO BE. FOR A DISCUSSION OF

CURRENT TAX MATTERS, SEE NOTE 10: PROVISION FOR

TAXES AND NOTE 18: CONTINGENCIES IN

PART II, ITEM 8 OF THIS

FORM

10-K.

LONG-LIVED ASSETS

WE ASSESS THE IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS WHEN EVENTS OR

CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THAT THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE

ASSETS OR THE ASSET GROUPING MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE. FACTORS

THAT WE CONSIDER IN DECIDING WHEN TO PERFORM AN IMPAIRMENT

REVIEW INCLUDE SIGNIFICANT UNDER-PERFORMANCE OF A BUSINESS OR

PRODUCT LINE IN RELATION TO EXPECTATIONS, SIGNIFICANT NEGATIVE

INDUSTRY OR ECONOMIC TRENDS, AND SIGNIFICANT CHANGES OR PLANNED

CHANGES IN OUR USE OF THE ASSETS. RECOVERABILITY OF ASSETS THAT

WILL CONTINUE TO BE USED IN OUR OPERATIONS IS MEASURED BY

COMPARING THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF THE ASSET GROUPING TO OUR

ESTIMATE OF THE RELATED TOTAL FUTURE NET CASH FLOWS. IF AN ASSET

GROUPINGS CARRYING VALUE IS NOT RECOVERABLE THROUGH THE

RELATED CASH FLOWS, THE ASSET GROUPING IS CONSIDERED TO BE

IMPAIRED. THE IMPAIRMENT IS MEASURED BY THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN

THE ASSET GROUPINGS CARRYING AMOUNT AND ITS FAIR VALUE,

BASED ON THE BEST INFORMATION AVAILABLE, INCLUDING MARKET PRICES

OR DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW ANALYSIS.

IMPAIRMENTS OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS ARE DETERMINED FOR GROUPS OF

ASSETS RELATED TO THE LOWEST LEVEL OF IDENTIFIABLE INDEPENDENT

CASH FLOWS. DUE TO OUR ASSET USAGE MODEL AND THE INTERCHANGEABLE

NATURE OF OUR SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING CAPACITY, WE MUST MAKE

SUBJECTIVE JUDGMENTS IN DETERMINING THE INDEPENDENT CASH FLOWS

THAT CAN BE RELATED TO SPECIFIC ASSET GROUPINGS. IN ADDITION, AS

WE MAKE MANUFACTURING PROCESS CONVERSIONS AND OTHER FACTORY

PLANNING DECISIONS, WE MUST MAKE SUBJECTIVE JUDGMENTS REGARDING

THE REMAINING USEFUL LIVES OF ASSETS, PRIMARILY PROCESS-SPECIFIC

SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING TOOLS AND BUILDING IMPROVEMENTS.

WHEN WE DETERMINE THAT THE USEFUL LIVES OF ASSETS ARE SHORTER

THAN WE HAD ORIGINALLY ESTIMATED, AND THERE ARE SUFFICIENT CASH

FLOWS TO SUPPORT THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE ASSETS, WE ACCELERATE

THE RATE OF DEPRECIATION CHARGES IN ORDER TO FULLY DEPRECIATE

THE ASSETS OVER THEIR NEW SHORTER USEFUL LIVES. IMPAIRMENTS AND

ACCELERATED DEPRECIATION OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS WERE APPROXIMATELY

$20 MILLION IN 2005 (APPROXIMATELY $50 MILLION IN 2004

AND $220 MILLION IN 2003).

INVENTORY

THE VALUATION OF INVENTORY REQUIRES US TO ESTIMATE OBSOLETE OR

EXCESS INVENTORY AS WELL AS INVENTORY THAT IS NOT OF SALEABLE

QUALITY. THE DETERMINATION OF OBSOLETE OR EXCESS INVENTORY

REQUIRES US TO ESTIMATE THE FUTURE DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS

WITHIN SPECIFIC TIME HORIZONS, GENERALLY SIX MONTHS OR LESS. THE

ESTIMATES OF FUTURE DEMAND THAT WE USE IN THE VALUATION OF

INVENTORY ARE THE SAME AS THOSE USED IN OUR PUBLISHED REVENUE

FORECASTS AND ARE ALSO CONSISTENT WITH THE ESTIMATES USED IN OUR

SHORT-TERM MANUFACTURING PLANS. IF OUR DEMAND FORECAST FOR

SPECIFIC PRODUCTS IS GREATER THAN ACTUAL DEMAND AND WE FAIL TO

REDUCE MANUFACTURING OUTPUT ACCORDINGLY, WE COULD BE REQUIRED TO

WRITE DOWN ADDITIONAL INVENTORY, WHICH WOULD HAVE A NEGATIVE

IMPACT ON OUR GROSS MARGIN.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

OVERVIEW

2005 WAS A YEAR OF MANY NOTABLE ACCOMPLISHMENTS FOR INTEL. WE

EXPERIENCED OUR THIRD YEAR OF DOUBLE-DIGIT GROWTH IN ANNUAL

REVENUE, GROSS MARGIN DOLLARS, OPERATING PROFIT AND NET INCOME.

THE MAJORITY OF THE GROWTH DURING 2005 WAS DUE TO THE SUCCESS OF

OUR NOTEBOOK COMPUTING PLATFORMS. OUR FINANCIAL POSITION REMAINS

STRONG, AND WE GENERATED $14.8 BILLION IN CASH FLOWS FROM

OPERATIONS IN 2005. WE WERE ABLE TO RETURN A TOTAL OF

$12.6 BILLION TO STOCKHOLDERS THROUGH OUR HIGHEST LEVEL OF

STOCK REPURCHASES AND DIVIDENDS IN OUR COMPANYS HISTORY.

WE ALSO UNDERWENT THE LARGEST REORGANIZATION IN OUR

COMPANYS HISTORY, WHICH

RE-ALIGNED

OUR COMPANY

AROUND PLATFORM SOLUTIONS, AND WE EMBARKED ON A MASSIVE

REBRANDING EFFORT. WHILE THE FIRST HALF WAS STRONG, OUR RESULTS

FOR THE SECOND HALF WERE LOWER THAN SEASONAL. OUR RESULTS FOR

THE FOURTH QUARTER WERE LOWER THAN EXPECTED, PRIMARILY DUE TO

THE STRONG COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE.

IN 2006, WE ARE PLANNING FOR FURTHER GROWTH IN REVENUE AND GROSS

MARGIN DOLLARS, ALTHOUGH WE EXPECT THIS GROWTH TO BE TEMPERED

SOMEWHAT FROM THE GROWTH RATES OF RECENT YEARS DUE TO THE

EXPECTATION OF SOME PRICING PRESSURE AND A SUSTAINED COMPETITIVE

LANDSCAPE. HOWEVER, WITH THE INTRODUCTION OF COMPELLING NEW

PLATFORMS AND A STRONG PROCESSOR ROADMAP, WE BELIEVE THAT WE ARE

POSITIONED WELL FOR FUTURE GROWTH. OUR NEW PLATFORMS INCLUDE THE

RECENTLY INTRODUCED INTEL CENTRINO DUO MOBILE TECHNOLOGY AND OUR

NEW PLATFORM BRAND FOR THE DIGITAL HOME, INTEL VIIV TECHNOLOGY.

WE ALSO EXPECT TO LAUNCH A NEW MICROARCHITECTURE IN THE SECOND

HALF OF 2006 THAT WE BELIEVE WILL DELIVER

PERFORMANCE-PER

-WATT

LEADERSHIP IN THE DESKTOP, MOBILE AND SERVER MARKET SEGMENTS. IN

ADDITION, WE ARE FOCUSING ON NEW BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES,

INCLUDING THE INTRODUCTION OF INTEL MICROPROCESSOR-BASED SYSTEMS

BY APPLE COMPUTER, INC., AND OUR ENTRANCE INTO THE NAND FLASH

MEMORY MARKET THROUGH IMFT, THE VENTURE WE FORMED IN JANUARY

2006 WITH MICRON. WE ANTICIPATE THAT A FAST RAMP OF OUR

DUAL-CORE MICROPROCESSOR PRODUCTS ON OUR INDUSTRY-LEADING

65-NANOMETER

PROCESS

TECHNOLOGY WILL ENABLE AND ENHANCE THESE GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES.

THE RAMP OF OUR

65-NANOMETER

MICROPROCESSOR PRODUCTS WILL ALSO ENABLE INCREASED CHIPSET

CAPACITY AS WE TRANSITION OUR CHIPSET PRODUCTION TO OUR

90-NANOMETER

PROCESS

TECHNOLOGY.

OUR NET REVENUE FOR 2005 WAS $38.8 BILLION, AN INCREASE OF

$4.6 BILLION, OR 13.5%, COMPARED TO 2004. THIS INCREASE WAS

PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER REVENUE FROM SALES OF MOBILE

MICROPROCESSORS AND HIGHER CHIPSET REVENUE. FISCAL YEAR 2005 WAS

A

53-WEEK

FISCAL YEAR

IN CONTRAST TO FISCAL YEAR 2004, WHICH WAS A

52-WEEK

FISCAL YEAR.

OUR ASIA-PACIFIC REGIONS REVENUE WAS APPROXIMATELY 50% OF

OUR TOTAL REVENUE IN 2005 AND CONTINUES TO BE OUR FASTEST

GROWING REGION, INCREASING 26% COMPARED TO 2004 AND REFLECTING

THE MOVEMENT OF MORE OF OUR CUSTOMERS PC SUPPLY CHAINS TO

ASIA. THIS MOVEMENT IN THE SUPPLY CHAIN HAS NEGATIVELY AFFECTED

OUR SALES IN THE AMERICAS REGION, WHICH DECREASED 5% COMPARED TO

2004. JAPAN REVENUE INCREASED 19% AND EUROPE REVENUE INCREASED

6% DURING 2005 COMPARED TO 2004. WE CONTINUED TO SEE GROWTH IN

BOTH MATURE AND EMERGING MARKETS.

OVERALL GROSS MARGIN DOLLARS FOR 2005 WERE $23.0 BILLION,

AN INCREASE OF $3.3 BILLION, OR 17%, COMPARED TO 2004. OUR

OVERALL GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE INCREASED TO 59.4% IN 2005 FROM

57.7% IN 2004. THE OVERALL GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE WAS

POSITIVELY AFFECTED BY A MIX SHIFT OF OUR TOTAL REVENUE TO THE

MOBILITY GROUP, WHICH HAS A HIGHER GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE. THE

GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGES FOR THE DIGITAL ENTERPRISE GROUP AND

FLASH MEMORY GROUP WERE HIGHER AND THE GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE

FOR THE MOBILITY GROUP WAS LOWER IN 2005 COMPARED TO 2004. AS A

RESULT OF A LITIGATION SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT WITH MICROUNITY, WE

RECORDED A $140 MILLION CHARGE TO COST OF SALES IN 2005, OF

WHICH $110 MILLION WAS ALLOCATED TO THE DIGITAL ENTERPRISE

GROUP AND $30 MILLION WAS ALLOCATED TO THE MOBILITY GROUP.

THE 2004 GROSS MARGIN WAS AFFECTED BY A LITIGATION SETTLEMENT

WITH INTERGRAPH IN WHICH WE RECORDED A $162 MILLION CHARGE

TO COST OF SALES, OF WHICH $120 MILLION WAS ALLOCATED TO

THE DIGITAL ENTERPRISE GROUP AND $42 MILLION WAS ALLOCATED

TO THE MOBILITY GROUP. SEE BUSINESS OUTLOOK LATER IN THIS

SECTION FOR A DISCUSSION OF GROSS MARGIN EXPECTATIONS.

OUR NET REVENUE FOR 2004 WAS $34.2 BILLION, AN INCREASE OF

$4.1 BILLION, OR 13.5%, COMPARED TO 2003. THIS INCREASE WAS

PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER NET REVENUE FROM SALES OF

MICROPROCESSORS IN THE DIGITAL ENTERPRISE GROUP AND THE MOBILITY

GROUP OPERATING SEGMENTS.

IN 2004, OUR ASIA-PACIFIC REGIONS REVENUE MADE UP THE

LARGEST PORTION OF OUR TOTAL REVENUE AND INCREASED 26%,

REFLECTING BOTH GROWTH IN LOCAL CONSUMPTION AND MOVEMENT OF MORE

OF THE PRODUCTION FOR OUR CUSTOMERS PC SUPPLY CHAINS TO

ASIA. THIS MOVEMENT IN THE SUPPLY CHAIN NEGATIVELY AFFECTED THE

AMERICAS REGION, WITH A DECREASE IN REVENUE OF 5% IN 2004

COMPARED TO 2003. JAPAN REVENUE INCREASED 15%, AND THE EUROPE

REGIONS REVENUE INCREASED 13% IN 2004 COMPARED TO 2003.

OVERALL GROSS MARGIN DOLLARS FOR 2004 WERE $19.7 BILLION,

AN INCREASE OF $2.7 BILLION, OR 16%, COMPARED TO 2003. OUR

OVERALL GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE INCREASED TO 57.7% IN 2004 FROM

56.7% IN 2003. AS A RESULT OF A LITIGATION SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT

WITH INTERGRAPH, WE RECORDED A $162 MILLION CHARGE TO COST

OF SALES IN 2004. THE GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE FOR THE DIGITAL

ENTERPRISE GROUP OPERATING SEGMENT WAS HIGHER THAN IN 2003, AND

THE GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGES FOR THE MOBILITY GROUP AND FLASH

MEMORY GROUP OPERATING SEGMENTS WERE APPROXIMATELY FLAT COMPARED

TO 2003.

REVENUE FOR THE DEG OPERATING SEGMENT WAS APPROXIMATELY FLAT

COMPARED TO 2004. REVENUE FROM SALES OF MICROPROCESSORS WAS

APPROXIMATELY FLAT, WITH SLIGHTLY HIGHER UNIT SALES BEING OFFSET

BY SLIGHTLY LOWER AVERAGE SELLING PRICES. REVENUE FROM SALES OF

SERVER MICROPROCESSORS IN 2005 WAS NEGATIVELY AFFECTED BY THE

HIGHLY COMPETITIVE SERVER MARKET. CHIPSETS, MOTHERBOARD AND

OTHER REVENUE WAS HIGHER, PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER AVERAGE

SELLING PRICES OF CHIPSETS. MICROPROCESSORS WITHIN DEG INCLUDE

MICROPROCESSORS DESIGNED FOR THE DESKTOP AND ENTERPRISE

COMPUTING MARKET SEGMENTS, PREVIOUSLY INCLUDED WITHIN THE FORMER

INTEL ARCHITECTURE BUSINESS OPERATING SEGMENT, AS WELL AS

EMBEDDED MICROPROCESSORS. REVENUE FROM NETWORK PROCESSORS, WHICH

ARE BASED ON OUR INTEL XSCALE TECHNOLOGY, IS INCLUDED IN OTHER

REVENUE ABOVE.

OPERATING INCOME WAS ALSO APPROXIMATELY FLAT, AT

$9.0 BILLION IN 2005 COMPARED TO $8.85 BILLION IN

2004. THE OPERATING INCOME FOR DEG WAS POSITIVELY AFFECTED BY

LOWER MICROPROCESSOR UNIT COSTS AND HIGHER CHIPSET REVENUE.

THESE IMPROVEMENTS WERE OFFSET BY APPROXIMATELY

$380 MILLION OF HIGHER

START-UP

COSTS IN 2005,

PRIMARILY RELATED TO OUR

65-NANOMETER

PROCESS

TECHNOLOGY. PRODUCTS BASED ON OUR

65-NANOMETER

PROCESS

TECHNOLOGY BEGAN SHIPPING IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2005.

ALTHOUGH REVENUE WAS FLAT, OPERATING EXPENSES INCREASED IN 2005,

WHICH NEGATIVELY AFFECTED OPERATING INCOME. BOTH PERIODS WERE

NEGATIVELY AFFECTED BY LITIGATION SETTLEMENT AGREEMENTS. RESULTS

FOR 2005 INCLUDED A CHARGE RELATED TO A SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT

WITH MICROUNITY, AND RESULTS FOR 2004 INCLUDED A CHARGE RELATED

TO A SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT WITH INTERGRAPH.

FOR 2004, REVENUE FOR THE DEG OPERATING SEGMENT INCREASED BY

$1.7 BILLION, OR 7%, COMPARED TO 2003. THE INCREASE IN DEG

REVENUE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER UNIT SALES OF

MICROPROCESSORS AND MOTHERBOARDS. THE INCREASE WAS PARTIALLY

OFFSET BY LOWER AVERAGE SELLING PRICES FOR MICROPROCESSORS

DESIGNED FOR DESKTOP PLATFORMS, AND LOWER CHIPSET REVENUE. WE

RAMPED OUR

90-NANOMETER

PROCESS TECHNOLOGY IN 2004 AND EXITED THE YEAR WITH THE MAJORITY

OF MICROPROCESSORS SHIPPED BY THE DEG OPERATING SEGMENT BEING

MANUFACTURED ON THIS TECHNOLOGY.

OPERATING INCOME INCREASED TO $8.85 BILLION IN 2004

COMPARED TO $8.0 BILLION IN 2003. THE INCREASE WAS

PRIMARILY DUE TO THE IMPACT OF HIGHER REVENUE AND LOWER UNIT

COSTS FOR MICROPROCESSORS, AS WELL AS APPROXIMATELY

$160 MILLION OF LOWER MANUFACTURING

START-UP

COSTS. THESE

INCREASES IN OPERATING INCOME WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER

OPERATING EXPENSES, LOWER CHIPSET REVENUE AND THE NEGATIVE

IMPACT OF REDUCING THE CARRYING VALUE OF ENDING CHIPSET

INVENTORY TO LOWER CURRENT REPLACEMENT COSTS. IN ADDITION, WE

RECORDED A CHARGE IN 2004 RELATED TO A SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT WITH

INTERGRAPH.

$1,743

REVENUE FOR THE MG OPERATING SEGMENT INCREASED BY

$4.15 BILLION, OR 59%, IN 2005 COMPARED TO 2004. THIS

INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER REVENUE FROM

SALES OF MICROPROCESSORS, WHICH INCREASED $3.0 BILLION, OR

54%, IN 2005 COMPARED TO 2004, REFLECTING THE CONTINUED GROWTH

IN THE NOTEBOOK MARKET SEGMENT. INCREASED USE OF MICROPROCESSORS

DESIGNED SPECIFICALLY FOR MOBILE PLATFORMS IN NOTEBOOK COMPUTERS

ALSO CONTRIBUTED TO THE HIGHER REVENUE. THE HIGHER REVENUE FROM

SALES OF MICROPROCESSORS WAS DUE TO SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER UNIT

SALES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER AVERAGE SELLING PRICES,

PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER UNIT SALES OF THE CELERON M PROCESSOR,

OUR VALUE MOBILE PROCESSOR. REVENUE FROM SALES OF CHIPSETS AND

WIRELESS CONNECTIVITY PRODUCTS ALSO INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY IN

2005 COMPARED TO 2004, PRIMARILY DUE TO THE SUCCESS OF INTEL

CENTRINO MOBILE TECHNOLOGY. REVENUE FROM APPLICATION PROCESSORS,

WHICH ARE BASED ON INTEL XSCALE TECHNOLOGY, INCREASED DUE TO

GROWTH IN DATA-ENABLED CELLULAR PHONES, AND IS INCLUDED IN

CHIPSET, MOTHERBOARD AND OTHER REVENUE ABOVE.

OPERATING INCOME INCREASED TO $5.3 BILLION IN 2005 FROM

$2.8 BILLION IN 2004. THE SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN OPERATING

INCOME WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER REVENUE. IN ADDITION,

OPERATING EXPENSES FOR THE MG OPERATING SEGMENT DID NOT INCREASE

AS FAST AS REVENUE, AND MICROPROCESSOR UNIT COSTS WERE LOWER.

THESE INCREASES IN OPERATING INCOME WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY

APPROXIMATELY $170 MILLION OF HIGHER

START-UP

COSTS IN 2005,

PRIMARILY RELATED TO OUR

65-NANOMETER

PROCESS

TECHNOLOGY. PRODUCTS BASED ON OUR

65-NANOMETER

PROCESS

TECHNOLOGY BEGAN SHIPPING IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2005.

FOR 2004, REVENUE FOR THE MG OPERATING SEGMENT INCREASED BY

$1.9 BILLION, OR 37%, COMPARED TO 2003. THE INCREASE IN MG

REVENUE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO SUBSTANTIALLY HIGHER UNIT SALES OF

MICROPROCESSORS DESIGNED FOR NOTEBOOKS. THE INCREASE IN REVENUE

WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE SUCCESS OF OUR INTEL CENTRINO MOBILE

TECHNOLOGY PLATFORM, WHICH ALSO RESULTED IN HIGHER SALES OF

MOBILE CHIPSET PRODUCTS AND WIRELESS CONNECTIVITY PRODUCTS. WE

RAMPED OUR

90-NANOMETER

PROCESS TECHNOLOGY IN 2004 AND EXITED THE YEAR WITH THE MAJORITY

OF MICROPROCESSORS SHIPPED BY THE MG OPERATING SEGMENT BEING

MANUFACTURED ON THIS TECHNOLOGY.

OPERATING INCOME INCREASED TO $2.8 BILLION IN 2004 COMPARED

TO $1.7 BILLION IN 2003. THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO

THE IMPACT OF HIGHER REVENUE AND LOWER UNIT COSTS FOR

MICROPROCESSORS. THESE INCREASES IN OPERATING INCOME WERE

PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER OPERATING EXPENSES.

BY LOWER AVERAGE SELLING PRICES. OPERATING LOSS REMAINED

APPROXIMATELY FLAT IN 2005 AT $154 MILLION, COMPARED TO

$149 MILLION IN 2004. THE OPERATING LOSS WAS POSITIVELY

ALSO INCLUDE THE RESULTS OF SALES OF NAND FLASH MEMORY PRODUCTS.

FOR 2004, REVENUE FOR THE FMG OPERATING SEGMENT INCREASED

$677 MILLION, OR 42%, COMPARED TO 2003. THE INCREASE IN FMG

REVENUE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER UNIT SALES. OPERATING LOSS

REMAINED APPROXIMATELY FLAT IN 2004 AT $149 MILLION,

COMPARED TO $152 MILLION IN 2003. THE OPERATING LOSS WAS

POSITIVELY AFFECTED BY HIGHER REVENUE, AS WELL AS APPROXIMATELY

$100 MILLION FROM LOWER INVENTORY WRITE-OFFS FOR FLASH

MEMORY PRODUCTS DUE TO IMPROVED DEMAND AND SALES OF NOR FLASH

MEMORY INVENTORY THAT HAD BEEN PREVIOUSLY WRITTEN DOWN. THIS

POSITIVE EFFECT WAS OFFSET BY HIGHER UNIT COSTS FOR FLASH MEMORY

PRODUCTS, AS WE SOLD HIGHER DENSITY PRODUCTS, AND BY THE IMPACT

OF REDUCING THE CARRYING VALUE OF ENDING INVENTORY TO LOWER

OFFSET BY LOWER EXPENSES RELATED TO DEVELOPMENT FOR OUR

NEXT-GENERATION

65-NANOMETER

MANUFACTURING PROCESS TECHNOLOGY. IN ADDITION, FISCAL YEAR 2005

INCLUDED 53 WEEKS IN CONTRAST TO 52 WEEKS IN 2004. THE

INCREASE IN 2004 COMPARED TO 2003 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER

EXPENSES RELATED TO DEVELOPMENT OF MANUFACTURING PROCESS

65-NANOMETER

PROCESS ON

300MM WAFERS, AND HIGHER EXPENSES FOR PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT

PROGRAMS, AS WELL AS HIGHER PROFIT-DEPENDENT COMPENSATION

INCREASED $381 MILLION, OR 9%, IN 2004 COMPARED TO 2003.

THE INCREASE IN 2005 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER MARKETING

PROGRAM SPENDING, HIGHER HEADCOUNT AND HIGHER PROFIT-DEPENDENT

COMPENSATION EXPENSES AS WELL AS THE EXTRA WORK WEEK. THE

INCREASE IN 2004 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER COOPERATIVE

ADVERTISING EXPENSES (AS A RESULT OF HIGHER REVENUE FROM SALES

OF MICROPROCESSORS IN THE DEG AND MG OPERATING SEGMENTS, AND

BECAUSE OUR CUSTOMERS USED A HIGHER PERCENTAGE OF THEIR

AVAILABLE INTEL INSIDE PROGRAM FUNDS) AND INCREASED

PROFIT-DEPENDENT COMPENSATION EXPENSES. IN ADDITION, THE

INCREASE WAS DUE TO HIGHER MARKETING EXPENSES FROM ADDITIONAL

MARKETING PROGRAMS AND INCREASED ADVERTISING EXPENSES.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ALONG WITH MARKETING, GENERAL AND

ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES WERE 28% OF NET REVENUE IN 2005 AND

2004, AND 29% OF NET REVENUE IN 2003.

AMORTIZATION OF ACQUISITION-RELATED INTANGIBLES AND COSTS WAS

$126 MILLION IN 2005 ($179 MILLION IN 2004 AND

$301 MILLION IN 2003). THE DECREASED AMORTIZATION EACH YEAR

COMPARED TO THE PREVIOUS YEAR WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO A PORTION OF

THE INTANGIBLES RELATED TO PRIOR ACQUISITIONS BECOMING FULLY

AMORTIZED.

DURING 2005 AND 2004, WE COMPLETED ANNUAL REVIEWS AND CONCLUDED

THAT GOODWILL WAS NOT IMPAIRED IN EITHER YEAR. DURING 2003,

UNDER THE FORMER REPORTING UNIT STRUCTURE, WE FOUND INDICATORS

OF IMPAIRMENT OF GOODWILL AND RECORDED A

NON-CASH

IMPAIRMENT

CHARGE OF $611 MILLION, WHICH WAS INCLUDED AS A COMPONENT

OF OPERATING INCOME IN THE ALL OTHER CATEGORY FOR

SEGMENT REPORTING PURPOSES. UNDER THE FORMER REPORTING

STRUCTURE, THE WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS BUSINESS UNIT HAD NOT

PERFORMED AS MANAGEMENT HAD EXPECTED. IT BECAME APPARENT THAT

THE BUSINESS WAS EXPECTED TO GROW MORE SLOWLY THAN HAD

PREVIOUSLY BEEN PROJECTED. A SLOWER-THAN-EXPECTED ROLLOUT OF

PRODUCTS AND SLOWER-THAN-EXPECTED CUSTOMER ACCEPTANCE OF THE

REPORTING UNITS PRODUCTS IN THE CELLULAR BASEBAND

PROCESSOR BUSINESS, AS WELL AS A DELAY IN THE TRANSITION TO

NEXT-GENERATION PHONE NETWORKS, HAD PUSHED OUT THE FORECASTS FOR

SALES INTO HIGH-END DATA CELL PHONES. THESE FACTORS RESULTED IN

LOWER GROWTH EXPECTATIONS FOR THE REPORTING UNIT AND TRIGGERED

THE GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT. ALSO DURING 2003, THE GOODWILL RELATED

TO ONE OF OUR SEED BUSINESSES, INCLUDED IN THE ALL

OTHER CATEGORY, WAS IMPAIRED.

LOSSES ON EQUITY SECURITIES, NET FOR 2005 WERE $45 MILLION

COMPARED TO $2 MILLION FOR 2004. THE NET LOSS FOR 2005

INCLUDED IMPAIRMENTS OF $208 MILLION, PRIMARILY DUE TO A

$105 MILLION IMPAIRMENT CHARGE ON OUR INVESTMENT IN MICRON.

THE IMPAIRMENT WAS PRINCIPALLY BASED ON OUR ASSESSMENT DURING

THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2005 OF MICRONS FINANCIAL RESULTS

AND THE FACT THAT THE MARKET PRICE OF MICRONS STOCK HAD

BEEN BELOW OUR COST BASIS FOR AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF TIME, AS

WELL AS THE COMPETITIVE PRICING ENVIRONMENT FOR DRAM PRODUCTS.

THE NET LOSS FOR 2004 INCLUDED IMPAIRMENTS OF APPROXIMATELY

$117 MILLION, PRIMARILY ON NON-MARKETABLE EQUITY

SECURITIES. GAINS ON EQUITY TRANSACTIONS OF $163 MILLION

LARGELY OFFSET THE IMPAIRMENTS FOR 2005 ($115 MILLION FOR

2004).

LOSSES ON EQUITY SECURITIES, NET FOR 2004 WERE $2 MILLION

COMPARED TO $283 MILLION FOR 2003. THE IMPROVEMENT WAS

PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY LOWER IMPAIRMENT CHARGES ON INVESTMENTS,

PARTICULARLY ON NON-MARKETABLE EQUITY SECURITIES

($117 MILLION FOR 2004 AND $319 MILLION FOR 2003). THE

DECREASE IN THE IMPAIRMENT CHARGES IN 2004 REFLECTED THE

DECREASE IN THE TOTAL CARRYING AMOUNT OF THE NON-MARKETABLE

EQUITY INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO THAT HAD OCCURRED OVER THE PREVIOUS

COUPLE OF YEARS. BOTH PERIODS HAD GAINS ON EQUITY TRANSACTIONS

THAT OFFSET IMPAIRMENTS.

INTEREST AND OTHER, NET INCREASED TO $565 MILLION IN 2005

COMPARED TO $289 MILLION IN 2004, REFLECTING HIGHER

INTEREST INCOME AS A RESULT OF HIGHER INTEREST RATES. INTEREST

AND OTHER, NET INCREASED TO $289 MILLION IN 2004 COMPARED

TO $192 MILLION IN 2003, REFLECTING HIGHER INTEREST INCOME

AS A RESULT OF HIGHER AVERAGE INVESTMENT BALANCES AND HIGHER

INTEREST RATES. INTEREST AND OTHER, NET FOR 2004 ALSO INCLUDED

APPROXIMATELY $60 MILLION OF GAINS ASSOCIATED WITH

TERMINATING FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS FOR MANUFACTURING FACILITIES

AND EQUIPMENT IN IRELAND.

OUR EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE WAS 31.3% IN 2005 (27.8% IN 2004

AND 24.2% IN 2003). THE RATE FOR 2005 INCLUDED AN INCREASE TO

THE TAX PROVISION OF APPROXIMATELY $265 MILLION AS A RESULT

OF THE DECISION TO REPATRIATE FOREIGN EARNINGS UNDER THE

AMERICAN JOBS CREATION ACT OF 2004 (THE JOBS ACT), WHICH WAS

PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE REVERSAL OF PREVIOUSLY ACCRUED ITEMS.

THE TAX RATE FOR 2004 INCLUDED A $195 MILLION REDUCTION TO

THE TAX PROVISION, PRIMARILY FROM ADDITIONAL BENEFITS FOR EXPORT

SALES ALONG WITH STATE TAX BENEFITS FOR DIVESTITURES, AS WELL AS

THE REVERSAL OF PREVIOUSLY ACCRUED TAXES, PRIMARILY RELATED TO

THE CLOSING OF A STATE INCOME TAX AUDIT. THE RATE FOR 2003

INCLUDED A $758 MILLION REDUCTION TO THE TAX PROVISION

RELATED TO DIVESTITURES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE NON-DEDUCTIBLE

GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT CHARGE.

FINANCIAL CONDITION

OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION REMAINS STRONG. AT DECEMBER 31,

2005, CASH, SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS AND FIXED INCOME DEBT

INSTRUMENTS INCLUDED IN TRADING ASSETS TOTALED

$12.4 BILLION, DOWN FROM $16.8 BILLION AT

DECEMBER 25, 2004. AT DECEMBER 31, 2005, TOTAL

SHORT-TERM AND LONG-TERM DEBT WAS $2.4 BILLION AND

REPRESENTED 6.7% OF STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY (AT

DECEMBER 25, 2004, TOTAL DEBT WAS $904 MILLION AND

REPRESENTED 2.3% OF STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY).

CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES IS NET INCOME ADJUSTED FOR

CERTAIN NON-CASH ITEMS AND CHANGES IN ASSETS AND LIABILITIES.

FOR 2005, CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES WAS

$14.8 BILLION, COMPARED TO $13.1 BILLION IN 2004 AND

$11.5 BILLION IN 2003. IN 2005 COMPARED TO 2004, THE

MAJORITY OF THE INCREASE IN CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING

ACTIVITIES WAS FROM MATURITIES OF TRADING ASSETS IN EXCESS OF

PURCHASES AND HIGHER NET INCOME. IN 2004 COMPARED TO 2003, THE

MAJORITY OF THE INCREASE IN CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING

ACTIVITIES WAS DUE TO HIGHER NET INCOME. INCOME TAXES PAYABLE

INCREASED COMPARED TO 2004 DUE TO TIMING OF ESTIMATED PAYMENTS

AND THE IMPACT OF REPATRIATION UNDER THE JOBS ACT. ACCOUNTS

RECEIVABLE INCREASED IN 2005 COMPARED TO 2004, PRIMARILY DUE TO

HIGHER REVENUE AND A HIGHER PROPORTION OF SALES OCCURRING AT THE

END OF THE FOURTH QUARTER. ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE WAS APPROXIMATELY

FLAT IN 2004 COMPARED TO 2003. FOR 2005, OUR TWO LARGEST

CUSTOMERS ACCOUNTED FOR 35% OF NET REVENUE, WITH ONE OF THESE

CUSTOMERS ACCOUNTING FOR 19% OF REVENUE AND ANOTHER CUSTOMER

ACCOUNTING FOR 16%. FOR 2004, OUR TWO LARGEST CUSTOMERS

ACCOUNTED FOR 35% OF NET REVENUE (34% OF NET REVENUE FOR 2003).

ADDITIONALLY, THESE TWO LARGEST CUSTOMERS ACCOUNTED FOR 42% OF

NET ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AT DECEMBER 31, 2005 (34% AT

DECEMBER 25, 2004 AND 31% AT DECEMBER 27, 2003).

INVENTORIES IN 2005 INCREASED COMPARED TO 2004 LEVELS, PRIMARILY

DUE TO RAMPING OF NEW PRODUCTS. INVENTORIES WERE APPROXIMATELY

FLAT IN 2004 COMPARED TO 2003 LEVELS.

INVESTING CASH FLOWS CONSIST PRIMARILY OF CAPITAL EXPENDITURES,

THE PROCEEDS FROM INVESTMENT MATURITIES AND PAYMENT FOR

INVESTMENTS ACQUIRED. WE USED $6.4 BILLION IN NET CASH FOR

INVESTING ACTIVITIES DURING 2005, COMPARED TO $5.0 BILLION

DURING 2004 AND $7.1 BILLION DURING 2003. THE HIGHER CASH

USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES IN 2005 COMPARED TO 2004 RESULTED

FROM CAPITAL SPENDING, PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY INVESTMENTS IN

65-NANOMETER PRODUCTION EQUIPMENT. CAPITAL SPENDING WAS

$5.8 BILLION IN 2005 ($3.8 BILLION IN 2004 AND

$3.7 BILLION IN 2003). CAPITAL SPENDING FOR 2006 IS

EXPECTED TO BE $6.9 BILLION, PLUS OR MINUS

$200 MILLION, PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY INVESTMENTS IN 300MM,

45-NANOMETER PRODUCTION EQUIPMENT. DURING 2005, WE ALSO PAID

$191 MILLION IN CASH FOR ACQUISITIONS, NET OF CASH

ACQUIRED. OTHER INVESTING ACTIVITIES INCLUDED INTELLECTUAL

PROPERTY ASSETS ACQUIRED AS A RESULT OF A SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT

WITH MICROUNITY FOR $160 MILLION. THE HIGHER NET PURCHASES

OF AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE INVESTMENTS IN 2004 COMPARED TO 2005 WERE

DUE TO IMPROVED CORPORATE CREDIT PROFILES THAT FACILITATED A

SLIGHT SHIFT IN OUR PORTFOLIO OF INVESTMENTS IN DEBT SECURITIES

TO LONGER TERM MATURITIES. THE HIGHER CASH USED IN INVESTING

ACTIVITIES IN 2003 COMPARED TO 2004 ALSO RESULTED FROM HIGHER

NET PURCHASES OF AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE INVESTMENTS DUE TO IMPROVED

CORPORATE CREDIT PROFILES THAT FACILITATED A SLIGHT SHIFT IN OUR

PORTFOLIO OF INVESTMENTS IN DEBT SECURITIES TO LONGER TERM

MATURITIES THAT YEAR.

FINANCING CASH FLOWS CONSIST PRIMARILY OF REPURCHASES AND

RETIREMENT OF COMMON STOCK, PAYMENT OF DIVIDENDS TO STOCKHOLDERS

AND ADDITIONS TO LONG-TERM DEBT. WE USED $9.5 BILLION IN

NET CASH FOR FINANCING ACTIVITIES IN 2005 COMPARED TO

$7.7 BILLION IN 2004 AND $3.9 BILLION IN 2003. DURING

2005, OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS AMENDED THE COMPANYS ONGOING

AUTHORIZATION TO REPURCHASE UP TO $25 BILLION IN SHARES OF

INTELS COMMON STOCK IN OPEN MARKET OR NEGOTIATED

TRANSACTIONS, AND IN 2005 WE PURCHASED 418 MILLION SHARES

OF COMMON STOCK FOR $10.6 BILLION (301 MILLION SHARES

FOR $7.5 BILLION IN 2004 AND 176 MILLION SHARES FOR

$4.0 BILLION IN 2003). AT DECEMBER 31, 2005,

$21.9 BILLION REMAINED AVAILABLE FOR REPURCHASE UNDER

EXISTING REPURCHASE AUTHORIZATIONS. PAYMENT OF DIVIDENDS WAS

$2.0 BILLION IN 2005 ($1.0 BILLION IN 2004 AND

$524 MILLION IN 2003) DUE TO AN INCREASE IN THE QUARTERLY

CASH DIVIDEND FROM $0.04 PER SHARE TO $0.08 PER SHARE

EFFECTIVE BEGINNING IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2005. ON

JANUARY 19, 2006, OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS DECLARED A CASH

DIVIDEND OF $0.10 PER SHARE EFFECTIVE THE FIRST QUARTER OF

2006. THE DIVIDEND IS PAYABLE ON MARCH 1, 2006 TO

STOCKHOLDERS OF RECORD ON FEBRUARY 7, 2006. ADDITIONS TO

LONG-TERM DEBT INCLUDED $1.6 BILLION IN PROCEEDS FROM THE

ISSUANCE OF 2.95% JUNIOR SUBORDINATED CONVERTIBLE DEBENTURES

(THE DEBENTURES) DUE 2035. THE PROCEEDS FROM THE DEBENTURES ARE

AVAILABLE FOR GENERAL CORPORATE PURPOSES, AS WELL AS TO PURCHASE

SHARES OF INTEL COMMON STOCK. ADDITIONS TO LONG-TERM DEBT ALSO

INCLUDED $160 MILLION IN 4.375% BONDS ISSUED BY THE

INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY OF THE CITY OF CHANDLER,

ARIZONA (THE ARIZONA BONDS) DUE 2035. THE PROCEEDS FROM THE

ISSUANCE OF THE ARIZONA BONDS WILL BE USED TO FINANCE THE COSTS

OF ACQUISITION, CONSTRUCTION AND INSTALLATION OF CERTAIN

INDUSTRIAL SEWAGE AND WASTEWATER TREATMENT FACILITIES AND SOLID

WASTE DISPOSAL FACILITIES AS PART OF OUR SEMICONDUCTOR

MANUFACTURING PLANT LOCATED IN THE CITY OF CHANDLER, ARIZONA.

FINANCING SOURCES OF CASH DURING 2005 ALSO INCLUDED

$1.2 BILLION IN PROCEEDS FROM THE SALE OF SHARES PURSUANT

TO EMPLOYEE EQUITY INCENTIVE PLANS ($894 MILLION IN 2004

AND $967 MILLION IN 2003).

DURING JANUARY 2006, MICRON AND INTEL FORMED IMFT. AS PART OF

THE INITIAL CAPITAL CONTRIBUTION TO IMFT, INTEL PAID

$500 MILLION IN CASH IN JANUARY 2006, ISSUED

$581 MILLION IN NOTES, AND OWES AN ADDITIONAL

$115 MILLION IN CASH IN EXCHANGE FOR A 49% INTEREST IN IMFT.

EMPLOYEE EQUITY INCENTIVE PLANS

OUR EQUITY INCENTIVE PROGRAMS ARE BROAD-BASED, LONG-TERM

RETENTION PROGRAMS THAT ARE INTENDED TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN

TALENTED EMPLOYEES AND ALIGN STOCKHOLDER AND EMPLOYEE INTERESTS.

UNDER THE 2004 EQUITY INCENTIVE PLAN (THE 2004 PLAN),

240 MILLION SHARES OF COMMON STOCK WERE MADE AVAILABLE FOR

ISSUANCE DURING THE TWO-YEAR PERIOD ENDING JUNE 30, 2006.

IN MAY 2005, WE OBTAINED STOCKHOLDER APPROVAL TO EXTEND THE TERM

OF THE 2004 PLAN BY ONE YEAR, TO JUNE 30, 2007, AND TO MAKE

AN ADDITIONAL 130 MILLION SHARES OF COMMON STOCK AVAILABLE

FOR ISSUANCE AS EQUITY AWARDS TO EMPLOYEES AND NON-EMPLOYEE

DIRECTORS.

OUR GOAL HAS BEEN TO KEEP THE POTENTIAL INCREMENTAL DILUTION

RELATED TO OUR EQUITY INCENTIVE PROGRAMS TO A LONG-TERM AVERAGE

OF LESS THAN 2% ANNUALLY. THE DILUTION PERCENTAGE IS CALCULATED

USING THE NEW OPTION GRANTS FOR THE YEAR, NET OF OPTIONS

CANCELLED DUE TO EMPLOYEES LEAVING THE COMPANY AND EXPIRED

OPTIONS, DIVIDED BY THE TOTAL OUTSTANDING SHARES AT THE

BUSINESS OUTLOOK

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES

IN ADDITION TO DISCLOSING FINANCIAL RESULTS CALCULATED IN

ACCORDANCE WITH U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING

PRINCIPLES (GAAP), THE FORECASTS BELOW CONTAIN NON-GAAP

FINANCIAL MEASURES THAT EXCLUDE THE EFFECTS OF SHARE-BASED

COMPENSATION EXPENSE AND THE REQUIREMENTS OF

SFAS NO. 123(R). COMMENCING WITH OUR FIRST QUARTER OF

2006, WE WILL INCLUDE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES OF OUR

FINANCIAL RESULTS FOR THE REPORTING PERIOD THAT EXCLUDE THE

INCOME STATEMENT EFFECTS OF SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION AND THE

EFFECTS OF SFAS NO. 123(R) UPON THE NUMBER OF DILUTED

SHARES USED IN CALCULATING NON-GAAP EARNINGS PER SHARE. FOR

FURTHER DISCUSSION ON THE REQUIREMENTS OF

SFAS NO. 123(R), SEE RECENT ACCOUNTING

PRONOUNCEMENTS WITHIN NOTE 2: ACCOUNTING

POLICIES IN PART II, ITEM 8 OF THIS

FORM

10-K.

THE

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES DISCLOSED SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED A

SUBSTITUTE FOR, OR SUPERIOR TO, FINANCIAL MEASURES CALCULATED IN

ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP, AND THE FINANCIAL RESULTS CALCULATED IN

ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP AND RECONCILIATIONS TO THOSE FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS SHOULD BE CAREFULLY EVALUATED. THE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL

MEASURES USED BY US MAY BE CALCULATED DIFFERENTLY FROM, AND

THEREFORE MAY NOT BE COMPARABLE TO, SIMILARLY TITLED MEASURES

USED BY OTHER COMPANIES.

WE WILL APPLY THE MODIFIED PROSPECTIVE METHOD OF ADOPTION OF

SFAS NO. 123(R), UNDER WHICH THE EFFECTS OF

SFAS NO. 123(R) WILL BE REFLECTED IN OUR GAAP

FINANCIAL STATEMENT PRESENTATIONS FOR AND AFTER THE FIRST

QUARTER OF 2006, BUT WILL NOT BE REFLECTED IN RESULTS FOR PRIOR

PERIODS. GROSS MARGIN, EXPENSES (RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT AND

MARKETING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE), OPERATING INCOME, INCOME

TAXES, NET INCOME AND EARNINGS PER SHARE ARE THE PRIMARY

FINANCIAL MEASURES THAT MANAGEMENT USES FOR PLANNING AND

FORECASTING FUTURE PERIODS AFFECTED BY SHARED-BASED

COMPENSATION. BECAUSE MANAGEMENT WILL CONTINUE TO REVIEW THESE

FINANCIAL MEASURES CALCULATED WITHOUT TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE

EFFECTS OF THE NEW REQUIREMENTS UNDER SFAS NO. 123(R),

UPON IMPLEMENTATION OF SFAS NO. 123(R) THESE FINANCIAL

MEASURES ARE TREATED AS NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES

UNDER SEC RULES. MANAGEMENT USES THE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES

FOR INTERNAL MANAGERIAL PURPOSES, INCLUDING AS A MEANS TO

COMPARE

PERIOD-TO

-PERIOD

RESULTS ON BOTH A SEGMENT BASIS AND CONSOLIDATED BASIS, AND AS A

MEANS TO EVALUATE OUR RESULTS ON A CONSOLIDATED BASIS COMPARED

TO THOSE OF OTHER COMPANIES. IN ADDITION, MANAGEMENT USES

CERTAIN OF THESE MEASURES WHEN PUBLICLY PROVIDING

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS ON EXPECTATIONS REGARDING FUTURE

CONSOLIDATED-BASIS FINANCIAL RESULTS.

OUR SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION PROGRAMS ARE ESTABLISHED AND

MANAGED ON A CORPORATE-WIDE BASIS, INCLUDING SPECIFICATION OF

GRANT TYPES AND AMOUNT RANGES FOR EMPLOYEES BY CATEGORY AND

GRADE. FOLLOWING IMPLEMENTATION OF SFAS NO. 123(R),

SEGMENT MANAGERS WILL NOT BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR SHARE-BASED

COMPENSATION CHARGES IMPACTING THEIR BUSINESS UNITS

OPERATING INCOME (LOSS), AND ACCORDINGLY SHARE-BASED

COMPENSATION CHARGES WILL BE EXCLUDED FROM OUR MEASURE OF

SEGMENT PROFITABILITY (OPERATING INCOME). THEREFORE, THE REVIEW

OF SEGMENT RESULTS BY MANAGEMENT AND THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS WILL

EXCLUDE SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION.

ADDITIONALLY, MANAGEMENT AND THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS WILL

CONTINUE TO COMPARE OUR HISTORICAL CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS (REVENUE; GROSS MARGIN; RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT;

MARKETING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES; OPERATING

INCOME; NET INCOME; AND EARNINGS PER SHARE), EXCLUDING

SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION, TO FINANCIAL INFORMATION PREPARED ON

THE SAME BASIS DURING OUR BUDGET AND PLANNING PROCESS, TO ASSESS

THE BUSINESS AND TO COMPARE CONSOLIDATED RESULTS TO THE

OBJECTIVES IDENTIFIED BY US. OUR BUDGET AND PLANNING PROCESS

COMMENCES WITH A SEGMENT-LEVEL EVALUATION WHICH, AS NOTED

ABOVE, EXCLUDES SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION AND CULMINATES

WITH THE PREPARATION OF A CONSOLIDATED ANNUAL AND/OR QUARTERLY

BUDGET THAT INCLUDES THESE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES (GROSS

MARGIN; RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES; MARKETING, GENERAL

AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES; OPERATING INCOME; INCOME TAX

EXPENSE; NET INCOME; AND EARNINGS PER SHARE). THIS BUDGET, ONCE

FINALIZED AND APPROVED, SERVES AS THE BASIS FOR ALLOCATION OF

RESOURCES AND MANAGEMENT OF OPERATIONS. WHILE SHARE-BASED

COMPENSATION IS A SIGNIFICANT EXPENSE AFFECTING OUR RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS, MANAGEMENT EXCLUDES SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION FROM

OUR CONSOLIDATED BUDGET AND PLANNING PROCESS TO FACILITATE

PERIOD-TO

-PERIOD

COMPARISONS AND TO ASSESS CHANGES IN GROSS MARGIN DOLLAR, NET

INCOME AND EARNINGS PER SHARE TARGETS IN RELATION TO CHANGES IN

FORECASTED REVENUE.

PROFIT-DEPENDENT CASH-INCENTIVE PAY TO EMPLOYEES, INCLUDING

SENIOR MANAGEMENT, ALSO IS CALCULATED USING FORMULAE THAT

INCORPORATE OUR ANNUAL RESULTS (OPERATING INCOME AND/OR EARNINGS

PER SHARE) EXCLUDING SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE. FOR

EXAMPLE, FOR 2006 THE EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION CASH INCENTIVE PLAN

FORMULA MEASURES EARNINGS PER SHARE AS THE GREATER OF OUR

OPERATING INCOME OR OUR NET INCOME DIVIDED BY WEIGHTED AVERAGE

DILUTED COMMON SHARES OUTSTANDING, IN BOTH CASES EXCLUDING THE

EFFECTS OF SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION.

WE DISCLOSE THIS INFORMATION TO THE PUBLIC TO ENABLE INVESTORS

TO MORE EASILY ASSESS OUR PERFORMANCE ON THE SAME BASIS APPLIED

BY MANAGEMENT AND TO EASE COMPARISON ON BOTH A GAAP AND NON-GAAP

BASIS AMONG OTHER COMPANIES THAT SEPARATELY IDENTIFY SHARE-BASED

COMPENSATION EXPENSES. IN PARTICULAR, AS WE BEGIN TO APPLY

SFAS NO. 123(R), WE BELIEVE THAT IT IS USEFUL TO

INVESTORS TO UNDERSTAND HOW THE EXPENSES AND OTHER ADJUSTMENTS

ASSOCIATED WITH THE APPLICATION OF SFAS NO. 123(R) ARE

BEING REFLECTED ON OUR INCOME STATEMENTS.

ALTHOUGH THESE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES ADJUST EXPENSE AND

DILUTED SHARE ITEMS TO EXCLUDE THE ACCOUNTING TREATMENT OF

SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION, THEY SHOULD NOT BE VIEWED AS A PRO

FORMA PRESENTATION REFLECTING THE ELIMINATION OF THE UNDERLYING

SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION PROGRAMS, AS THOSE PROGRAMS ARE AN

IMPORTANT ELEMENT OF OUR COMPENSATION STRUCTURE, AND GAAP

INDICATE THAT ALL FORMS OF SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS SHOULD BE VALUED

AND INCLUDED AS APPROPRIATE IN RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. MANAGEMENT

TAKES INTO CONSIDERATION THIS ASPECT OF THE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL

MEASURES BY EVALUATING THE DILUTIVE EFFECT OF OUR SHARE-BASED

COMPENSATION ARRANGEMENTS ON OUR BASIC AND DILUTED EARNINGS PER

SHARE CALCULATIONS AND BY REVIEWING OTHER QUANTITATIVE AND

2006 OUTLOOK

OUR FUTURE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND THE OTHER FORWARD-LOOKING

STATEMENTS CONTAINED IN THIS FILING, INCLUDING THIS MD&A,

INVOLVE A NUMBER OF RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES IN PARTICULAR,

THE STATEMENTS REGARDING OUR GOALS AND STRATEGIES, NEW PRODUCT

INTRODUCTIONS, PLANS TO CULTIVATE NEW BUSINESSES, FUTURE

ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, REVENUE, PRICING, GROSS MARGIN AND COSTS,

CAPITAL SPENDING, DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION, RESEARCH AND

DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES, POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT OF INVESTMENTS, THE

TAX RATE, AND PENDING TAX AND LEGAL PROCEEDINGS. OUR FUTURE

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS MAY ALSO BE AFFECTED BY THE AMOUNT, TYPE,

AND VALUATION OF THE SHARE-BASED AWARDS GRANTED AS WELL AS THE

AMOUNT OF AWARDS FORFEITED DUE TO EMPLOYEE TURNOVER. IN ADDITION

TO THE VARIOUS IMPORTANT FACTORS DISCUSSED ABOVE, A NUMBER OF

OTHER FACTORS COULD CAUSE ACTUAL RESULTS TO DIFFER MATERIALLY

FROM OUR EXPECTATIONS. SEE THE RISKS DESCRIBED IN RISK

FACTORS IN PART I, ITEM 1A OF THIS

FORM

AND

ELSEWHERE IN THIS

FORM

REVENUE FOR 2006 IS EXPECTED TO BE 6% TO 9% HIGHER THAN THE

TOTAL IN 2005 OF $38.8 BILLION. OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS,

PARTICULARLY OUR REVENUE, ARE SUBSTANTIALLY DEPENDENT ON SALES

OF MICROPROCESSORS. REVENUE IS PARTLY A FUNCTION OF THE MIX OF

TYPES AND PERFORMANCE CAPABILITIES OF MICROPROCESSORS SOLD, AS

WELL AS THE MIX OF CHIPSETS, FLASH MEMORY AND OTHER

SEMICONDUCTOR PRODUCTS SOLD, ALL OF WHICH ARE DIFFICULT TO

FORECAST. BECAUSE OF THE WIDE PRICE DIFFERENCES AMONG MOBILE,

DESKTOP AND SERVER MICROPROCESSORS, THE MIX OF TYPES AND

PERFORMANCE LEVELS OF MICROPROCESSORS SOLD AFFECTS THE AVERAGE

SELLING PRICE THAT WE WILL REALIZE AND HAS A LARGE IMPACT ON OUR

REVENUE AND GROSS MARGIN. MICROPROCESSOR REVENUE IS ALSO

DEPENDENT ON THE AVAILABILITY OF OTHER PARTS OF THE PLATFORM,

INCLUDING CHIPSETS, MOTHERBOARDS, OPERATING SYSTEM SOFTWARE AND

APPLICATION SOFTWARE. REVENUE IS ALSO SUBJECT TO DEMAND

FLUCTUATIONS AND THE IMPACT OF ECONOMIC CONDITIONS IN VARIOUS

GEOGRAPHIC REGIONS.

OUR GROSS MARGIN EXPECTATION FOR 2006 IS 57% PLUS OR MINUS A FEW

POINTS. EXCLUDING THE EFFECTS OF SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION OF

APPROXIMATELY 1%, OUR GROSS MARGIN EXPECTATION FOR 2006 IS 58%,

PLUS OR MINUS A FEW POINTS. ON A GAAP BASIS, THE 57% MIDPOINT IS

LOWER COMPARED TO OUR 2005 GROSS MARGIN OF 59.4%. IN ADDITION TO

THE RECOGNITION OF SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION, WE WILL BEGIN TO

RECOGNIZE

START-UP

COSTS RELATED TO IMFT IN 2006. WE ALSO EXPECT HIGHER UNIT COSTS

AND SLIGHTLY LOWER AVERAGE SELLING PRICES FOR MICROPROCESSORS.

WE EXPECT THESE NEGATIVE EFFECTS TO OUR MARGIN IN 2006 TO BE

PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER

START-UP

COSTS ON

MICROPROCESSORS AND CHIPSETS.

OUR GROSS MARGIN VARIES PRIMARILY WITH REVENUE LEVELS.

VARIABILITY OF OTHER FACTORS WILL ALSO CONTINUE TO AFFECT COST

OF SALES AND THE GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE, INCLUDING VARIATIONS

IN INVENTORY VALUATION, SUCH AS VARIATIONS RELATED TO THE TIMING

OF QUALIFYING PRODUCTS FOR SALE; UNIT COSTS AND YIELD ISSUES

ASSOCIATED WITH PRODUCTION AT OUR FACTORIES; EXCESS OR OBSOLETE

INVENTORY; TIMING AND EXECUTION OF THE PRODUCTION RAMP AND

ASSOCIATED COSTS, INCLUDING START-UP COSTS; MANUFACTURING OR

ASSEMBLY AND TEST CAPACITY UTILIZATION; THE REUSABILITY OF

FACTORY EQUIPMENT; IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS, INCLUDING

MANUFACTURING, ASSEMBLY AND TEST, AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS; AND THE

VALUATION OF STOCK OPTIONS AND OTHER EQUITY AWARDS, WHICH

AFFECTS THE AMOUNT OF SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION INCLUDED IN COST

OF SALES.

WE HAVE SIGNIFICANTLY EXPANDED OUR SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING

AND ASSEMBLY AND TEST CAPACITY OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS, AND WE

CONTINUE TO PLAN CAPACITY BASED ON THE ASSUMED CONTINUED SUCCESS

OF OUR OVERALL STRATEGY AND THE ACCEPTANCE OF OUR PRODUCTS IN

SPECIFIC MARKET SEGMENTS. WE CURRENTLY EXPECT THAT CAPITAL

SPENDING IN 2006 WILL BE APPROXIMATELY $6.9 BILLION, PLUS

OR MINUS $200 MILLION, COMPARED TO $5.8 BILLION IN

2005. MOST OF THE PROJECTED INCREASE WILL BE SPENT ON

CONSTRUCTION AND CAPITAL EQUIPMENT RELATED TO OUR

NEXT-GENERATION, 45-NANOMETER PROCESS TECHNOLOGY. THIS

CAPITAL-SPENDING PLAN IS DEPENDENT ON EXPECTATIONS REGARDING

PRODUCTION EFFICIENCIES AND DELIVERY TIMES OF VARIOUS MACHINERY

AND EQUIPMENT, AND CONSTRUCTION SCHEDULES. IF THE DEMAND FOR OUR

PRODUCTS DOES NOT GROW AND CONTINUES TO MOVE TOWARD HIGHER

PERFORMANCE PRODUCTS IN THE VARIOUS MARKET SEGMENTS, REVENUE AND

GROSS MARGIN WOULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED, MANUFACTURING AND/OR

ASSEMBLY AND TEST CAPACITY WOULD BE UNDER-UTILIZED, AND THE RATE

OF CAPITAL SPENDING COULD BE REDUCED. WE COULD BE REQUIRED TO

RECORD AN IMPAIRMENT OF OUR MANUFACTURING OR ASSEMBLY AND TEST

EQUIPMENT AND/OR FACILITIES, OR FACTORY PLANNING DECISIONS MAY

CAUSE US TO RECORD ACCELERATED DEPRECIATION. HOWEVER, IN THE

LONG TERM, REVENUE AND GROSS MARGIN MAY ALSO BE AFFECTED IF WE

DO NOT ADD CAPACITY FAST ENOUGH TO MEET MARKET DEMAND.

DEPRECIATION FOR 2006 IS EXPECTED TO BE APPROXIMATELY

$4.7 BILLION, PLUS OR MINUS $100 MILLION, COMPARED TO

$4.3 BILLION IN 2005.

OUR INDUSTRY IS CHARACTERIZED BY VERY SHORT PRODUCT LIFE CYCLES,

AND OUR CONTINUED SUCCESS IS DEPENDENT ON TECHNOLOGICAL

ADVANCEMENT, INCLUDING DEVELOPING AND IMPLEMENTING NEW PROCESSES

AND STRATEGIC PRODUCTS FOR SPECIFIC MARKET SEGMENTS. WE CONSIDER

IT IMPERATIVE TO MAINTAIN A STRONG RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

PROGRAM, AND OUR SPENDING FOR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT IN 2006

IS EXPECTED TO BE APPROXIMATELY $6.5 BILLION, COMPARED TO

$5.1 BILLION IN 2005. EXCLUDING THE EFFECTS OF SHARE-BASED

COMPENSATION OF APPROXIMATELY $500 MILLION, SPENDING FOR

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT IN 2006 IS EXPECTED TO BE APPROXIMATELY

$6.0 BILLION.

OUR SPENDING FOR MARKETING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES

IN 2006 IS EXPECTED TO BE APPROXIMATELY $6.6 BILLION,

COMPARED TO $5.7 BILLION IN 2005. EXCLUDING THE EFFECTS OF

SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION OF APPROXIMATELY $600 MILLION,

SPENDING FOR MARKETING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE IN 2006 IS

EXPECTED TO BE APPROXIMATELY $6.0 BILLION. EXPENSES,

PARTICULARLY CERTAIN MARKETING AND COMPENSATION EXPENSES, VARY

DEPENDING ON THE LEVEL OF DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS AND THE LEVEL

OF REVENUE AND PROFIT.

BASED ON ACQUISITIONS COMPLETED THROUGH FEBRUARY 22, 2006,

WE EXPECT AMORTIZATION OF ACQUISITION-RELATED INTANGIBLES AND

COSTS TO BE APPROXIMATELY $40 MILLION IN 2006.

AT THE END OF 2005, WE HELD NON-MARKETABLE EQUITY SECURITIES

WITH A CARRYING VALUE OF $561 MILLION. OUR NON-MARKETABLE

EQUITY SECURITIES INCLUDE INVESTMENTS THROUGH OUR INTEL CAPITAL

PROGRAM. THE PROGRAM SEEKS TO INVEST IN COMPANIES AND BUSINESSES

THAT CAN SUCCEED AND HAVE AN IMPACT ON THEIR MARKET SEGMENT.

WHEN THE STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES OF AN INVESTMENT HAVE BEEN

ACHIEVED, OR IF THE INVESTMENT OR BUSINESS DIVERGES FROM OUR

STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES, WE MAY DECIDE TO DISPOSE OF THE

INVESTMENT. HOWEVER, OUR INVESTMENTS IN NON-MARKETABLE EQUITY

SECURITIES ARE NOT LIQUID, AND THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT WE

WILL BE ABLE TO DISPOSE OF THESE INVESTMENTS ON FAVORABLE TERMS

OR AT ALL.

WE EXPECT OUR TAX RATE TO BE APPROXIMATELY 32% FOR 2006,

COMPARED TO 31.3% IN 2005. THE ESTIMATED EFFECTIVE TAX RATE IS

BASED ON TAX LAW IN EFFECT AT DECEMBER 31, 2005 AND CURRENT

EXPECTED INCOME, AND ASSUMES THAT WE WILL CONTINUE TO RECEIVE

THE TAX BENEFIT FOR EXPORT SALES. SEE NOTE 10.

PROVISION FOR TAXES AND NOTE 18.

CONTINGENCIES IN PART II, ITEM 8 OF THIS

FORM

10-K.

THE TAX

RATE MAY ALSO BE AFFECTED BY THE CLOSING OF ACQUISITIONS OR

DIVESTITURES; THE JURISDICTION IN WHICH PROFITS ARE DETERMINED

TO BE EARNED AND TAXED; CHANGES IN ESTIMATES OF CREDITS,

BENEFITS AND DEDUCTIONS, INCLUDING CHANGES IN THE DEDUCTIONS

RELATED TO SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION; THE RESOLUTION OF ISSUES

ARISING FROM TAX AUDITS WITH VARIOUS TAX AUTHORITIES; AND THE

ABILITY TO REALIZE DEFERRED TAX ASSETS.

WE BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE THE PRODUCT OFFERINGS, FACILITIES,

PERSONNEL, AND COMPETITIVE AND FINANCIAL RESOURCES FOR CONTINUED

BUSINESS SUCCESS, BUT FUTURE REVENUE, COSTS, GROSS MARGIN AND

PROFITS ARE ALL INFLUENCED BY A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING

THOSE DISCUSSED ABOVE, ALL OF WHICH ARE INHERENTLY DIFFICULT TO

FORECAST.

STATUS OF BUSINESS OUTLOOK

ITEM 7A.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

WE ARE EXPOSED TO FINANCIAL MARKET RISKS, INCLUDING CHANGES IN

CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES, INTEREST RATES AND MARKETABLE EQUITY

SECURITY PRICES. TO MITIGATE THESE RISKS, WE MAY UTILIZE

DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, AMONG OTHER STRATEGIES. WE DO

NOT USE DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS FOR SPECULATIVE

PURPOSES. ALL OF THE POTENTIAL CHANGES NOTED BELOW ARE BASED ON

SENSITIVITY ANALYSES PERFORMED ON OUR FINANCIAL POSITIONS AT

DECEMBER 31, 2005 AND DECEMBER 25, 2004. ACTUAL

RESULTS MAY DIFFER MATERIALLY.

CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES

WE GENERALLY HEDGE CURRENCY RISKS OF

NON-U.S.

-DOLLAR-DENOMINATED

INVESTMENTS IN DEBT SECURITIES WITH OFFSETTING CURRENCY

BORROWINGS, CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS OR CURRENCY INTEREST RATE

SWAPS. GAINS AND LOSSES ON THESE

NON-U.S.

-CURRENCY

INVESTMENTS WOULD GENERALLY BE OFFSET BY CORRESPONDING LOSSES

AND GAINS ON THE RELATED HEDGING INSTRUMENTS, RESULTING IN

NEGLIGIBLE NET EXPOSURE.

A SUBSTANTIAL MAJORITY OF OUR REVENUE, EXPENSE AND CAPITAL

PURCHASING ACTIVITIES ARE TRANSACTED IN U.S. DOLLARS.

HOWEVER, WE DO INCUR CERTAIN OPERATING COSTS IN OTHER

CURRENCIES, PRIMARILY THE EURO AND CERTAIN OTHER EUROPEAN AND

ASIAN CURRENCIES. TO PROTECT AGAINST REDUCTIONS IN VALUE AND THE

VOLATILITY OF FUTURE CASH FLOWS CAUSED BY CHANGES IN CURRENCY

EXCHANGE RATES, WE HAVE ESTABLISHED BALANCE SHEET AND FORECASTED

TRANSACTION RISK MANAGEMENT PROGRAMS. CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS

AND CURRENCY OPTIONS ARE GENERALLY UTILIZED IN THESE HEDGING

PROGRAMS. OUR HEDGING PROGRAMS REDUCE, BUT DO NOT ALWAYS

ENTIRELY ELIMINATE, THE IMPACT OF CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE

MOVEMENTS. WE CONSIDERED THE HISTORICAL TRENDS IN CURRENCY

EXCHANGE RATES AND DETERMINED THAT IT WAS REASONABLY POSSIBLE

THAT ADVERSE CHANGES IN EXCHANGE RATES OF 20% FOR ALL CURRENCIES

COULD BE EXPERIENCED IN THE NEAR TERM. SUCH ADVERSE CHANGES,

AFTER TAKING INTO ACCOUNT HEDGES AND OFFSETTING POSITIONS, WOULD

HAVE RESULTED IN AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON INCOME BEFORE TAXES OF

LESS THAN $30 MILLION AT THE END OF 2005 AND 2004.

INTEREST RATES

THE PRIMARY OBJECTIVE OF OUR INVESTMENTS IN DEBT SECURITIES IS

TO PRESERVE PRINCIPAL WHILE MAXIMIZING YIELDS, WITHOUT

SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASING RISK. TO ACHIEVE THIS OBJECTIVE, THE

RETURNS ON OUR INVESTMENTS IN FIXED-RATE DEBT SECURITIES ARE

GENERALLY BASED ON THREE-MONTH LIBOR, OR, IF LONGER TERM, ARE

GENERALLY SWAPPED TO U.S. DOLLAR LIBOR-BASED RETURNS. IN

ADDITION TO INVESTMENTS, IN 2005 WE ISSUED ADDITIONAL DEBT. WE

CONSIDERED THE HISTORICAL VOLATILITY OF THE INTEREST RATES

EXPERIENCED IN PRIOR YEARS AND THE DURATION OF OUR INVESTMENT

PORTFOLIO AND DEBT ISSUANCES, AND DETERMINED THAT IT WAS

REASONABLY POSSIBLE THAT AN ADVERSE CHANGE OF 80 BASIS

POINTS (0.80%), APPROXIMATELY 18% OF THE RATE AT THE END OF

2005, COULD BE EXPERIENCED IN THE NEAR TERM. A HYPOTHETICAL

0.80% INCREASE IN INTEREST RATES, AFTER TAKING INTO ACCOUNT

HEDGES AND OFFSETTING POSITIONS, WOULD HAVE RESULTED IN A

DECREASE IN THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR NET INVESTMENT POSITION OF

APPROXIMATELY $10 MILLION AND $20 MILLION AS OF THE

END OF 2005 AND 2004, RESPECTIVELY.

MARKETABLE EQUITY SECURITY PRICES

WE HAVE A PORTFOLIO OF STRATEGIC EQUITY INVESTMENTS THAT

INCLUDES MARKETABLE STRATEGIC EQUITY SECURITIES AND DERIVATIVE

EQUITY INSTRUMENTS SUCH AS WARRANTS AND OPTIONS, AS WELL AS

NON-MARKETABLE EQUITY INVESTMENTS, WHICH ARE DISCUSSED FURTHER

BELOW. WE INVEST IN COMPANIES THAT DEVELOP SOFTWARE, HARDWARE OR

SERVICES SUPPORTING OUR TECHNOLOGIES. THESE INVESTMENTS HELP

ADVANCE OUR OVERALL GOAL TO BE THE PREEMINENT PROVIDER OF

SILICON CHIPS AND PLATFORM SOLUTIONS TO THE WORLDWIDE DIGITAL

ECONOMY. OUR CURRENT INVESTMENT FOCUS AREAS INCLUDE HELPING TO

ENABLE MOBILE WIRELESS DEVICES, ADVANCE THE DIGITAL HOME,

ENHANCE THE DIGITAL ENTERPRISE, ADVANCE HIGH-PERFORMANCE

COMMUNICATIONS INFRASTRUCTURES AND DEVELOP THE NEXT GENERATION

OF SILICON PRODUCTION TECHNOLOGIES. OUR FOCUS AREAS TEND TO

DEVELOP AND CHANGE OVER TIME DUE TO RAPID ADVANCEMENTS IN THE

TECHNOLOGY FIELD.

OUR TOTAL MARKETABLE PORTFOLIO INCLUDES MARKETABLE STRATEGIC

EQUITY SECURITIES AS WELL AS MARKETABLE EQUITY SECURITIES

CLASSIFIED AS TRADING ASSETS. TO THE EXTENT THAT OUR MARKETABLE

PORTFOLIO OF INVESTMENTS CONTINUES TO HAVE STRATEGIC VALUE, WE

TYPICALLY DO NOT ATTEMPT TO REDUCE OR ELIMINATE OUR MARKET

EXPOSURE. FOR SECURITIES THAT WE NO LONGER CONSIDER STRATEGIC,

WE EVALUATE LEGAL, MARKET AND ECONOMIC FACTORS IN OUR DECISION

ON THE TIMING OF DISPOSAL AND WHETHER IT IS POSSIBLE AND

APPROPRIATE TO HEDGE THE EQUITY MARKET RISK. WE MAY OR MAY NOT

ENTER INTO TRANSACTIONS TO REDUCE OR ELIMINATE THE MARKET RISKS

OF OUR INVESTMENTS IN STRATEGIC EQUITY DERIVATIVES, INCLUDING

WARRANTS.

THE MARKETABLE EQUITY SECURITIES INCLUDED IN TRADING ASSETS, AS

WELL AS CERTAIN EQUITY DERIVATIVES, ARE HELD TO GENERATE RETURNS

THAT GENERALLY OFFSET CHANGES IN LIABILITIES RELATED TO THE

EQUITY MARKET RISK OF CERTAIN DEFERRED COMPENSATION

ARRANGEMENTS. THE GAINS AND LOSSES FROM CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE OF

THESE EQUITY SECURITIES ARE GENERALLY OFFSET BY THE GAINS AND

LOSSES ON THE RELATED LIABILITIES, RESULTING IN A NET EXPOSURE

OF LESS THAN $10 MILLION AS OF BOTH DECEMBER 31, 2005

AND DECEMBER 25, 2004, ASSUMING A REASONABLY POSSIBLE

DECLINE IN MARKET PRICES OF APPROXIMATELY 11% IN THE NEAR TERM.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2005, THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR PORTFOLIO OF

MARKETABLE STRATEGIC EQUITY INVESTMENTS AND EQUITY DERIVATIVE

INSTRUMENTS, INCLUDING HEDGING POSITIONS, WAS $574 MILLION

($662 MILLION AS OF DECEMBER 25, 2004). TO ASSESS THE

MARKET PRICE SENSITIVITY OF THESE EQUITY SECURITIES, WE ANALYZED

THE HISTORICAL MOVEMENTS OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS OF

HIGH-TECHNOLOGY STOCK INDICES THAT WE CONSIDERED APPROPRIATE.

HOWEVER, OUR MARKETABLE STRATEGIC EQUITY PORTFOLIO IS

SUBSTANTIALLY CONCENTRATED IN ONE COMPANY AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2005, WHICH WILL AFFECT THE PORTFOLIOS

PRICE VOLATILITY. WE CURRENTLY HAVE AN INVESTMENT IN MICRON WITH

A FAIR VALUE OF $451 MILLION, OR 79% OF THE TOTAL

MARKETABLE STRATEGIC EQUITY PORTFOLIO VALUE INCLUDING EQUITY

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AT DECEMBER 31, 2005. DURING 2005,

WE RECOGNIZED AN IMPAIRMENT CHARGE OF $105 MILLION RELATED

TO OUR INVESTMENT IN MICRON REFLECTING THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN

THE COST BASIS OF THE INVESTMENT AND THE PRICE OF MICRONS

STOCK AT THE END OF THE SECOND QUARTER. THE IMPAIRMENT WAS

PRINCIPALLY BASED ON OUR ASSESSMENT DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF

2005 OF MICRONS FINANCIAL RESULTS AND THE FACT THAT THE

MARKET PRICE OF MICRONS STOCK HAD BEEN BELOW OUR COST

BASIS FOR AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF TIME, AS WELL AS THE COMPETITIVE

PRICING ENVIRONMENT FOR DRAM PRODUCTS. THE INVESTMENT IN MICRON

IS PART OF OUR STRATEGY TO SUPPORT THE DEVELOPMENT AND SUPPLY OF

DRAM PRODUCTS. BASED ON THE ANALYSIS OF THE HIGH-TECHNOLOGY

STOCK INDICES AND THE HISTORICAL VOLATILITY OF MICRONS

STOCK, WE ESTIMATED THAT IT WAS REASONABLY POSSIBLE THAT THE

PRICES OF THE STOCKS IN OUR MARKETABLE STRATEGIC EQUITY

PORTFOLIO COULD EXPERIENCE A LOSS OF 40% IN THE NEAR TERM (45%

AS OF THE END OF 2004). THE ASSUMED LOSS PERCENTAGE USED IN 2005

WAS LOWER THAN THE ASSUMED LOSS PERCENTAGE IN 2004 DUE TO THE

DIFFERENCES IN THE CONCENTRATIONS OF INVESTMENTS AT THE END OF

EACH YEAR. THIS ESTIMATE IS NOT NECESSARILY INDICATIVE OF FUTURE

PERFORMANCE, AND ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER MATERIALLY.

ASSUMING A LOSS OF 40% IN MARKET PRICES, AND AFTER REFLECTING

THE IMPACT OF HEDGES AND OFFSETTING POSITIONS, OUR MARKETABLE

STRATEGIC EQUITY PORTFOLIO COULD DECREASE IN VALUE BY

APPROXIMATELY $245 MILLION, BASED ON THE VALUE OF THE

PORTFOLIO AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2005 (A DECREASE IN VALUE OF

APPROXIMATELY $300 MILLION, BASED ON THE VALUE OF THE

PORTFOLIO AS OF DECEMBER 25, 2004 USING AN ASSUMED LOSS OF

45%). AT DECEMBER 25, 2004, OUR MARKETABLE STRATEGIC EQUITY

PORTFOLIO WAS SUBSTANTIALLY CONCENTRATED IN TWO COMPANIES. THE

FAIR VALUE OF OUR INVESTMENT IN MICRON WAS APPROXIMATELY

$400 MILLION, OR 60% OF THE TOTAL MARKETABLE PORTFOLIO

VALUE INCLUDING EQUITY DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AT

DECEMBER 25, 2004. IN ADDITION, THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR

INVESTMENT IN ELPIDA MEMORY, INC. WAS APPROXIMATELY

$212 MILLION, OR 32% OF THE PORTFOLIO AT DECEMBER 25,

2004. WE SOLD OUR INVESTMENT IN ELPIDA DURING 2005.

NON-MARKETABLE EQUITY SECURITIES

OUR STRATEGIC INVESTMENTS IN NON-MARKETABLE EQUITY SECURITIES

ARE AFFECTED BY MANY OF THE SAME FACTORS THAT COULD RESULT IN AN

ADVERSE MOVEMENT OF EQUITY MARKET PRICES, ALTHOUGH THE IMPACT

CANNOT BE DIRECTLY QUANTIFIED. SUCH A MOVEMENT AND THE

UNDERLYING ECONOMIC CONDITIONS WOULD NEGATIVELY AFFECT THE

PROSPECTS OF THE COMPANIES WE INVEST IN, THEIR ABILITY TO RAISE

ADDITIONAL CAPITAL AND THE LIKELIHOOD OF OUR BEING ABLE TO

REALIZE OUR INVESTMENTS THROUGH LIQUIDITY EVENTS SUCH AS INITIAL

PUBLIC OFFERINGS, MERGERS OR PRIVATE SALES. THESE TYPES OF

INVESTMENTS INVOLVE A GREAT DEAL OF RISK, AND THERE CAN BE NO

ASSURANCE THAT ANY SPECIFIC COMPANY WILL GROW OR BECOME

SUCCESSFUL; CONSEQUENTLY, WE COULD LOSE ALL OR PART OF OUR

INVESTMENT. AT DECEMBER 31, 2005, OUR STRATEGIC INVESTMENTS

IN NON-MARKETABLE EQUITY SECURITIES HAD A CARRYING AMOUNT OF

$561 MILLION ($507 MILLION AS OF DECEMBER 25,

2004). THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF THESE INVESTMENTS APPROXIMATED

FAIR VALUE AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2005 AND DECEMBER 24,

2004. NO INVESTMENT IN OUR NON-MARKETABLE EQUITY SECURITIES

PORTFOLIO WAS INDIVIDUALLY SIGNIFICANT AS OF DECEMBER 31,

2005 OR DECEMBER 25, 2004.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 1: BASIS OF PRESENTATION

INTEL CORPORATION HAS A 52- OR

53-WEEK

FISCAL YEAR

THAT ENDS ON THE LAST SATURDAY IN DECEMBER. FISCAL YEAR 2005, A

53-WEEK

YEAR, ENDED ON

DECEMBER 31, 2005. FISCAL YEAR 2004 WAS A

52-WEEK

YEAR THAT ENDED

ON DECEMBER 25, AND FISCAL YEAR 2003, ALSO A

52-WEEK

YEAR, ENDED ON

DECEMBER 27. THE NEXT

53-WEEK

YEAR WILL END

ON DECEMBER 31, 2011.

THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDE THE ACCOUNTS OF

INTEL AND ITS WHOLLY OWNED SUBSIDIARIES. INTERCOMPANY ACCOUNTS

AND TRANSACTIONS HAVE BEEN ELIMINATED. EQUITY INVESTMENTS OVER

WHICH THE COMPANY EXERCISES SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE BUT DOES NOT

HAVE CONTROL AND EQUITY INVESTMENTS IN VARIABLE INTEREST

ENTITIES FOR WHICH THE COMPANY IS NOT THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY

ARE ACCOUNTED FOR USING THE EQUITY METHOD. THE UNITED STATES

(U.S.) DOLLAR IS THE FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY FOR THE COMPANY,

AND THEREFORE THERE IS NO TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENT RECORDED

THROUGH ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME. MONETARY

ACCOUNTS DENOMINATED IN

NON-U.S.

CURRENCIES,

SUCH AS CASH OR PAYABLES TO VENDORS, HAVE BEEN REMEASURED TO THE

U.S. DOLLAR.

NOTE 2: ACCOUNTING POLICIES

USE OF ESTIMATES

THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN CONFORMITY WITH

U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES REQUIRES

MANAGEMENT TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS THAT AFFECT THE

AMOUNTS REPORTED IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND ACCOMPANYING

NOTES. THE ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES THAT REQUIRE MANAGEMENTS

MOST SIGNIFICANT, DIFFICULT AND SUBJECTIVE JUDGMENTS INCLUDE THE

VALUATION OF NON-MARKETABLE EQUITY SECURITIES; THE RECOGNITION

AND MEASUREMENT OF CURRENT AND DEFERRED INCOME TAX ASSETS AND

LIABILITIES; THE ASSESSMENT OF RECOVERABILITY OF LONG-LIVED

ASSETS; AND THE VALUATION OF INVENTORY. THE ACTUAL RESULTS

EXPERIENCED BY THE COMPANY MAY DIFFER FROM MANAGEMENTS

ESTIMATES.

CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS

HIGHLY LIQUID DEBT SECURITIES WITH INSIGNIFICANT INTEREST RATE

RISK AND WITH ORIGINAL MATURITIES FROM THE DATE OF PURCHASE OF

GENERALLY THREE MONTHS OR LESS ARE CLASSIFIED AS CASH AND CASH

EQUIVALENTS.

INVESTMENTS

TRADING ASSETS.

TRADING ASSETS ARE STATED AT FAIR VALUE,

WITH GAINS OR LOSSES RESULTING FROM CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE

RECOGNIZED CURRENTLY IN EARNINGS. THE COMPANY MAY ELECT TO

CLASSIFY A PORTION OF ITS MARKETABLE DEBT SECURITIES AS TRADING

ASSETS. FOR THESE DEBT INSTRUMENTS, GAINS OR LOSSES FROM CHANGES

IN FAIR VALUE DUE TO INTEREST RATE AND CURRENCY MARKET

FLUCTUATIONS, OFFSET BY LOSSES OR GAINS ON RELATED DERIVATIVES,

ARE INCLUDED IN INTEREST AND OTHER, NET. ALSO INCLUDED IN

TRADING ASSETS IS A MARKETABLE EQUITY PORTFOLIO HELD TO GENERATE

RETURNS THAT SEEK TO OFFSET CHANGES IN LIABILITIES RELATED TO

THE EQUITY MARKET RISK OF CERTAIN DEFERRED COMPENSATION

ARRANGEMENTS. GAINS OR LOSSES FROM CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE OF

THESE EQUITY SECURITIES, OFFSET BY LOSSES OR GAINS ON THE

RELATED LIABILITIES, ARE INCLUDED IN INTEREST AND OTHER, NET.

THE COMPANY ALSO USES FIXED-INCOME INVESTMENTS AND DERIVATIVE

INSTRUMENTS TO SEEK TO OFFSET THE REMAINING PORTION OF THE

CHANGES IN THE DEFERRED COMPENSATION LIABILITIES. IN ADDITION, A

PORTION OF THE COMPANYS MARKETABLE EQUITY SECURITIES MAY

FROM TIME TO TIME BE CLASSIFIED AS TRADING ASSETS, IF THE

COMPANY NO LONGER DEEMS THE INVESTMENTS TO BE STRATEGIC IN

NATURE AT THE TIME OF TRADING ASSET DESIGNATION, AND HAS THE

ABILITY AND INTENT TO MITIGATE EQUITY MARKET RISK THROUGH SALE

OR THE USE OF DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS. FOR THESE MARKETABLE

EQUITY SECURITIES, GAINS OR LOSSES FROM CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE,

PRIMARILY OFFSET BY LOSSES OR GAINS ON RELATED DERIVATIVE

INSTRUMENTS, ARE INCLUDED IN GAINS (LOSSES) ON EQUITY

SECURITIES, NET.

AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE INVESTMENTS.

INVESTMENTS DESIGNATED AS

AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE INCLUDE MARKETABLE DEBT AND EQUITY

SECURITIES. INVESTMENTS DESIGNATED AS AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE ARE

REPORTED AT FAIR VALUE, WITH UNREALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES, NET OF

TAX, RECORDED IN ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME. THE

COST OF SECURITIES SOLD IS BASED ON THE SPECIFIC IDENTIFICATION

METHOD. REALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES ON THE SALE OF DEBT SECURITIES

ARE RECORDED IN INTEREST AND OTHER, NET. REALIZED GAINS OR

LOSSES ON THE SALE OR EXCHANGE OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND DECLINES

IN VALUE JUDGED TO BE OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY ARE RECORDED IN GAINS

(LOSSES) ON EQUITY SECURITIES, NET.

DEBT SECURITIES WITH ORIGINAL MATURITIES GREATER THAN

APPROXIMATELY THREE MONTHS AND REMAINING MATURITIES LESS THAN

ONE YEAR ARE CLASSIFIED AS SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS. DEBT

SECURITIES WITH REMAINING MATURITIES GREATER THAN ONE YEAR ARE

CLASSIFIED AS LONG-TERM INVESTMENTS.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

INTEL CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

THE COMPANY ACQUIRES CERTAIN EQUITY INVESTMENTS FOR THE

PROMOTION OF BUSINESS AND STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES, AND TO THE

EXTENT THAT THESE INVESTMENTS CONTINUE TO HAVE STRATEGIC VALUE,

THE COMPANY TYPICALLY DOES NOT ATTEMPT TO REDUCE OR ELIMINATE

THE INHERENT EQUITY MARKET RISKS THROUGH HEDGING ACTIVITIES. THE

MARKETABLE PORTION OF THESE INVESTMENTS IS INCLUDED IN

MARKETABLE STRATEGIC EQUITY SECURITIES.

NON-MARKETABLE EQUITY SECURITIES AND OTHER INVESTMENTS.

NON-MARKETABLE EQUITY SECURITIES AND OTHER INVESTMENTS ARE

ACCOUNTED FOR AT HISTORICAL COST OR, IF INTEL HAS SIGNIFICANT

INFLUENCE OVER THE INVESTEE, USING THE EQUITY METHOD OF

ACCOUNTING. INTELS PROPORTIONATE SHARE OF INCOME OR LOSSES

FROM INVESTMENTS ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER THE EQUITY METHOD, AND ANY

GAIN OR LOSS ON DISPOSAL, ARE RECORDED IN INTEREST AND OTHER,

NET. GAINS OR LOSSES ON THE SALE OR EXCHANGE OF ALL OTHER

NON-MARKETABLE EQUITY SECURITIES ARE RECORDED IN GAINS (LOSSES)

ON EQUITY SECURITIES, NET. NON-MARKETABLE EQUITY SECURITIES AND

OTHER INVESTMENTS ARE INCLUDED IN OTHER ASSETS, EXCEPT FOR COST

BASIS LOAN PARTICIPATION NOTES, WHICH ARE CLASSIFIED AS

SHORT-TERM AND OTHER LONG-TERM INVESTMENTS.

OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENT.

ALL OF THE

COMPANYS AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE INVESTMENTS, NON-MARKETABLE

EQUITY SECURITIES AND OTHER INVESTMENTS ARE SUBJECT TO A

PERIODIC IMPAIRMENT REVIEW. INVESTMENTS ARE CONSIDERED TO BE

IMPAIRED WHEN A DECLINE IN FAIR VALUE IS JUDGED TO BE

OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY. THIS DETERMINATION REQUIRES SIGNIFICANT

JUDGMENT. MARKETABLE EQUITY SECURITIES ARE EVALUATED FOR

IMPAIRMENT IF THE DECLINE IN FAIR VALUE BELOW COST BASIS IS

SIGNIFICANT AND/OR HAS LASTED FOR AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF TIME.

THE EVALUATION INTEL USES TO DETERMINE WHETHER TO IMPAIR A

MARKETABLE EQUITY SECURITY IS BASED ON THE SPECIFIC FACTS AND

CIRCUMSTANCES PRESENT AT THAT TIME, AND INCLUDES THE

CONSIDERATION OF GENERAL MARKET CONDITIONS, THE DURATION AND

EXTENT TO WHICH THE FAIR VALUE IS LESS THAN COST, AND THE

COMPANYS INTENT AND ABILITY TO HOLD THE INVESTMENT FOR A

SUFFICIENT PERIOD OF TIME TO ALLOW FOR RECOVERY. THE COMPANY

ALSO CONSIDERS SPECIFIC ADVERSE CONDITIONS RELATED TO THE

FINANCIAL HEALTH OF AND BUSINESS OUTLOOK FOR THE INVESTEE,

INCLUDING INDUSTRY AND SECTOR PERFORMANCE, CHANGES IN

TECHNOLOGY, OPERATIONAL AND FINANCING CASH FLOW FACTORS, AND

RATING AGENCY ACTIONS. FOR NON-MARKETABLE EQUITY SECURITIES, THE

IMPAIRMENT ANALYSIS REQUIRES THE IDENTIFICATION OF EVENTS OR

CIRCUMSTANCES THAT WOULD LIKELY HAVE A SIGNIFICANT ADVERSE

EFFECT ON THE FAIR VALUE OF THE INVESTMENT. THE INDICATORS THAT

INTEL USES TO IDENTIFY THOSE EVENTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES INCLUDE

THE INVESTEES REVENUE AND EARNINGS TRENDS RELATIVE TO

PRE-DEFINED MILESTONES AND OVERALL BUSINESS PROSPECTS; THE

TECHNOLOGICAL FEASIBILITY OF THE INVESTEES PRODUCTS AND

TECHNOLOGIES; THE GENERAL MARKET CONDITIONS IN THE

INVESTEES INDUSTRY OR GEOGRAPHIC AREA, INCLUDING ADVERSE

REGULATORY OR ECONOMIC CHANGES; FACTORS RELATED TO THE

INVESTEES ABILITY TO REMAIN IN BUSINESS, SUCH AS THE

INVESTEES LIQUIDITY, DEBT RATIOS AND THE RATE AT WHICH THE

INVESTEE IS USING ITS CASH; AND THE INVESTEES RECEIPT OF

ADDITIONAL FUNDING AT A LOWER VALUATION. INVESTMENTS IDENTIFIED

AS HAVING AN INDICATOR OF IMPAIRMENT ARE SUBJECT TO FURTHER

ANALYSIS TO DETERMINE IF THE INVESTMENT IS OTHER THAN

TEMPORARILY IMPAIRED, IN WHICH CASE THE INVESTMENT IS WRITTEN

DOWN TO ITS IMPAIRED VALUE. WHEN AN INVESTEE IS NOT CONSIDERED

VIABLE FROM A FINANCIAL OR TECHNOLOGICAL POINT OF VIEW, THE

ENTIRE INVESTMENT IS WRITTEN DOWN, SINCE THE ESTIMATED FAIR

MARKET VALUE IS CONSIDERED TO BE NOMINAL. IF AN INVESTEE OBTAINS

ADDITIONAL FUNDING AT A VALUATION LOWER THAN INTELS

CARRYING AMOUNT OR REQUIRES A NEW ROUND OF EQUITY FUNDING TO

STAY IN OPERATION, AND THE NEW FUNDING DOES NOT APPEAR IMMINENT,

IT IS PRESUMED THAT THE INVESTMENT IS OTHER THAN TEMPORARILY

IMPAIRED, UNLESS SPECIFIC FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE

OTHERWISE. ONCE A DECLINE IN FAIR VALUE IS DETERMINED TO BE

OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY, AN IMPAIRMENT CHARGE IS RECORDED IN GAINS

(LOSSES) ON EQUITY SECURITIES, NET AND A NEW COST BASIS IN THE

INVESTMENT IS ESTABLISHED.

SECURITIES LENDING

FROM TIME TO TIME, THE COMPANY ENTERS INTO SECURITIES LENDING

AGREEMENTS WITH FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, GENERALLY TO FACILITATE

HEDGING AND CERTAIN INVESTMENT TRANSACTIONS. SELECTED SECURITIES

MAY BE LOANED, SECURED BY COLLATERAL IN THE FORM OF CASH OR

SECURITIES. THE LOANED SECURITIES CONTINUE TO BE CARRIED AS

INVESTMENT ASSETS ON THE BALANCE SHEET. CASH COLLATERAL IS

RECORDED AS AN ASSET WITH A CORRESPONDING LIABILITY. FOR LENDING

AGREEMENTS COLLATERALIZED BY SECURITIES, THE COLLATERAL IS NOT

RECORDED AS AN ASSET OR A LIABILITY, UNLESS THE COLLATERAL IS

REPLEDGED.

FAIR VALUES OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

THE CARRYING VALUE OF CASH EQUIVALENTS APPROXIMATES FAIR VALUE

DUE TO THE SHORT PERIOD OF TIME TO MATURITY. FAIR VALUES OF

SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS, TRADING ASSETS, LONG-TERM INVESTMENTS,

MARKETABLE STRATEGIC EQUITY SECURITIES, CERTAIN NON-MARKETABLE

INVESTMENTS, SHORT-TERM DEBT, LONG-TERM DEBT, SWAPS, CURRENCY

FORWARD CONTRACTS, CURRENCY OPTIONS, EQUITY OPTIONS AND WARRANTS

ARE BASED ON QUOTED MARKET PRICES OR PRICING MODELS USING

CURRENT MARKET DATA. DEBT SECURITIES ARE GENERALLY VALUED USING

DISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS IN A YIELD-CURVE MODEL BASED ON LIBOR.

EQUITY OPTIONS AND WARRANTS ARE PRICED USING AN OPTION PRICING

MODEL. FOR THE COMPANYS PORTFOLIO OF NON-MARKETABLE EQUITY

SECURITIES, MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE

PORTFOLIO APPROXIMATES THE FAIR VALUE AT DECEMBER 31, 2005

AND DECEMBER 25, 2004. THIS ESTIMATE TAKES INTO ACCOUNT THE

MARKET MOVEMENTS OF THE EQUITY AND VENTURE CAPITAL MARKETS, THE

IMPAIRMENT ANALYSES PERFORMED AND THE RELATED IMPAIRMENTS

RECORDED OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS. ALL OF THE COMPANYS

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS ARE RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE EXCEPT FOR

NON-MARKETABLE INVESTMENTS, INCLUDING COST BASIS LOAN

PARTICIPATION NOTES, AND DEBT. MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT THE

DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUES AND CARRYING

VALUES OF THESE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WERE NOT SIGNIFICANT AT

DECEMBER 31, 2005 AND DECEMBER 25, 2004. ESTIMATED

FAIR VALUES ARE MANAGEMENTS ESTIMATES; HOWEVER, WHEN THERE

IS NO READILY AVAILABLE MARKET, THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUES MAY

NOT NECESSARILY REPRESENT THE AMOUNTS THAT COULD BE REALIZED IN

A CURRENT TRANSACTION, AND THESE FAIR VALUES COULD CHANGE

SIGNIFICANTLY.

DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

THE COMPANYS PRIMARY OBJECTIVE FOR HOLDING DERIVATIVE

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS IS TO MANAGE CURRENCY, INTEREST RATE AND

SOME EQUITY MARKET RISKS. THE COMPANYS DERIVATIVE

INSTRUMENTS ARE RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE AND ARE INCLUDED IN OTHER

CURRENT ASSETS, OTHER ASSETS OR OTHER ACCRUED LIABILITIES.

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS RECORDED AS ASSETS TOTALED

$87 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2005 ($117 MILLION AT

DECEMBER 25, 2004). DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS RECORDED AS

LIABILITIES TOTALED $65 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2005

($179 MILLION AT DECEMBER 25, 2004). THE

COMPANYS ACCOUNTING POLICIES FOR CERTAIN OF THESE

INSTRUMENTS ARE BASED ON WHETHER THEY MEET THE COMPANYS

CRITERIA FOR DESIGNATION AS CASH FLOW OR FAIR VALUE HEDGES. A

HEDGE OF THE EXPOSURE TO VARIABILITY IN THE CASH FLOWS OF AN

ASSET OR A LIABILITY, OR OF A FORECASTED TRANSACTION, IS

REFERRED TO AS A CASH FLOW HEDGE. A DESIGNATED HEDGE OF THE

EXPOSURE TO CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE OF AN ASSET OR A LIABILITY, OR

OF AN UNRECOGNIZED FIRM COMMITMENT, IS REFERRED TO AS A FAIR

VALUE HEDGE. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2005, THE COMPANY DID NOT

HAVE ANY FAIR VALUE HEDGES. THE CRITERIA FOR DESIGNATING A

DERIVATIVE AS A HEDGE INCLUDE THE INSTRUMENTS

EFFECTIVENESS IN RISK REDUCTION, MATCHING OF THE DERIVATIVE

INSTRUMENT TO ITS UNDERLYING TRANSACTION AND THE PROBABILITY OF

OCCURRENCE OF THE UNDERLYING TRANSACTION. GAINS AND LOSSES FROM

CHANGES IN FAIR VALUES OF DERIVATIVES THAT ARE NOT DESIGNATED AS

HEDGES FOR ACCOUNTING PURPOSES ARE RECOGNIZED CURRENTLY IN

EARNINGS, AND GENERALLY OFFSET CHANGES IN THE VALUES OF RELATED

ASSETS OR LIABILITIES.

AS PART OF ITS STRATEGIC INVESTMENT PROGRAM, THE COMPANY ALSO

ACQUIRES EQUITY DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS, SUCH AS WARRANTS AND

EQUITY CONVERSION RIGHTS ASSOCIATED WITH DEBT INSTRUMENTS, WHICH

ARE NOT DESIGNATED AS HEDGING INSTRUMENTS. THE GAINS OR LOSSES

FROM CHANGES IN FAIR VALUES OF THESE EQUITY DERIVATIVES ARE

RECOGNIZED IN GAINS (LOSSES) ON EQUITY SECURITIES, NET.

CURRENCY RISK.

THE COMPANY TRANSACTS BUSINESS IN VARIOUS

CURRENCIES OTHER THAN THE U.S. DOLLAR, PRIMARILY THE EURO

AND CERTAIN OTHER EUROPEAN AND ASIAN CURRENCIES. THE COMPANY HAS

ESTABLISHED BALANCE SHEET AND FORECASTED TRANSACTION RISK

MANAGEMENT PROGRAMS TO PROTECT AGAINST FLUCTUATIONS IN FAIR

VALUE AND VOLATILITY OF FUTURE CASH FLOWS CAUSED BY CHANGES IN

EXCHANGE RATES. THE FORECASTED TRANSACTION RISK MANAGEMENT

PROGRAM INCLUDES ANTICIPATED TRANSACTIONS SUCH AS OPERATING

COSTS AND CAPITAL PURCHASES. THE COMPANY USES CURRENCY FORWARD

CONTRACTS, CURRENCY OPTIONS, CURRENCY INTEREST RATE SWAPS, AND

CURRENCY INVESTMENTS AND BORROWINGS IN THESE RISK MANAGEMENT

PROGRAMS. THESE PROGRAMS REDUCE, BUT DO NOT ALWAYS ENTIRELY

ELIMINATE, THE IMPACT OF CURRENCY EXCHANGE MOVEMENTS.

CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS AND CURRENCY OPTIONS THAT ARE USED TO

HEDGE EXPOSURES TO VARIABILITY IN THE

U.S.-DOLLAR

EQUIVALENT

OF ANTICIPATED

NON-U.S.-DOLLAR

-DENOMINATED

CASH FLOWS ARE DESIGNATED AS CASH FLOW HEDGES. THE DURATIONS OF

THESE INSTRUMENTS ARE GENERALLY LESS THAN 12 MONTHS. FOR

THESE DERIVATIVES, THE AFTER-TAX GAIN OR LOSS FROM THE EFFECTIVE

PORTION OF THE HEDGE IS REPORTED AS A COMPONENT OF OTHER

COMPREHENSIVE INCOME IN STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY AND IS

RECLASSIFIED INTO EARNINGS IN THE SAME PERIOD OR PERIODS IN

WHICH THE HEDGED TRANSACTION AFFECTS EARNINGS, AND WITHIN THE

SAME INCOME STATEMENT LINE ITEM AS THE IMPACT OF THE HEDGED

TRANSACTION.

CURRENCY INTEREST RATE SWAPS AND CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS ARE

USED TO OFFSET THE CURRENCY RISK OF INVESTMENTS IN

NON-U.S.-DOLLAR

-DENOMINATED

DEBT SECURITIES CLASSIFIED AS TRADING ASSETS, AS WELL AS OTHER

ASSETS AND LIABILITIES DENOMINATED IN VARIOUS CURRENCIES. THE

DURATIONS OF THESE INSTRUMENTS ARE GENERALLY LESS THAN

12 MONTHS, EXCEPT FOR DERIVATIVES HEDGING CERTAIN LONG-TERM

EQUITY-RELATED INVESTMENTS, WHICH ARE GENERALLY FIVE YEARS OR

LESS. CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE OF THE UNDERLYING ASSETS AND

LIABILITIES ARE GENERALLY OFFSET BY THE CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE OF

THE RELATED DERIVATIVES, WITH THE RESULTING NET GAIN OR LOSS, IF

ANY, RECORDED IN INTEREST AND OTHER, NET OR GAINS (LOSSES) ON

EQUITY SECURITIES, NET.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

INTEREST RATE RISK.

THE COMPANYS PRIMARY OBJECTIVE

FOR HOLDING INVESTMENTS IN DEBT SECURITIES IS TO PRESERVE

PRINCIPAL WHILE MAXIMIZING YIELDS WITHOUT SIGNIFICANTLY

INCREASING RISK. TO ACHIEVE THIS OBJECTIVE, THE RETURNS ON THE

COMPANYS INVESTMENTS IN FIXED-RATE DEBT SECURITIES ARE

GENERALLY BASED ON THREE-MONTH LIBOR OR, IF LONGER TERM, ARE

GENERALLY SWAPPED TO U.S. DOLLAR LIBOR-BASED RETURNS, USING

INTEREST RATE SWAPS AND CURRENCY INTEREST RATE SWAPS IN

TRANSACTIONS THAT ARE NOT DESIGNATED AS HEDGES FOR ACCOUNTING

PURPOSES. THE FLOATING INTEREST RATES ON THE SWAPS ARE RESET ON

A MONTHLY, QUARTERLY OR SEMIANNUAL BASIS. CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE

OF THE DEBT SECURITIES CLASSIFIED AS TRADING ASSETS ARE

GENERALLY OFFSET BY CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE OF THE RELATED

DERIVATIVES, RESULTING IN NEGLIGIBLE NET IMPACT RECORDED IN

INTEREST AND OTHER, NET.

THE COMPANY MAY ALSO ENTER INTO INTEREST RATE SWAP AGREEMENTS TO

MODIFY THE INTEREST CHARACTERISTICS OF A PORTION OF ITS

OUTSTANDING LONG-TERM DEBT. THESE TRANSACTIONS WOULD LIKELY BE

DESIGNATED AS FAIR VALUE HEDGES. THE GAINS OR LOSSES FROM THE

CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE OF THE INTEREST RATE SWAPS, AS WELL AS THE

OFFSETTING CHANGE IN THE HEDGED FAIR VALUE OF THE LONG-TERM

DEBT, WOULD BE RECOGNIZED IN INTEREST EXPENSE.

EQUITY MARKET RISK.

THE COMPANY MAY ENTER INTO

TRANSACTIONS DESIGNATED AS FAIR VALUE HEDGES USING EQUITY

OPTIONS, SWAPS OR FORWARD CONTRACTS TO HEDGE THE EQUITY MARKET

RISK OF MARKETABLE SECURITIES IN ITS PORTFOLIO OF STRATEGIC

EQUITY INVESTMENTS ONCE THE SECURITIES ARE NO LONGER CONSIDERED

TO HAVE STRATEGIC VALUE. THE GAIN OR LOSS FROM THE CHANGE IN

FAIR VALUE OF THESE EQUITY DERIVATIVES, AS WELL AS THE

OFFSETTING CHANGE IN HEDGED FAIR VALUE OF THE UNDERLYING EQUITY

SECURITIES, WOULD BE RECOGNIZED CURRENTLY IN GAINS (LOSSES) ON

EQUITY SECURITIES, NET. THE COMPANY MAY USE EQUITY DERIVATIVES

IN TRANSACTIONS NOT DESIGNATED AS HEDGES TO OFFSET THE CHANGE IN

FAIR VALUE OF CERTAIN EQUITY SECURITIES CLASSIFIED AS TRADING

ASSETS. THE COMPANY MAY OR MAY NOT ENTER INTO TRANSACTIONS TO

REDUCE OR ELIMINATE THE MARKET RISKS OF ITS INVESTMENTS IN

STRATEGIC EQUITY DERIVATIVES, INCLUDING WARRANTS.

MEASUREMENT OF EFFECTIVENESS OF HEDGE RELATIONSHIPS.

FOR

MOST CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS, EFFECTIVENESS IS MEASURED BY

COMPARING THE CUMULATIVE CHANGE IN THE HEDGE CONTRACT WITH THE

CUMULATIVE CHANGE IN THE HEDGED ITEM. FOR CURRENCY FORWARD

CONTRACTS USED IN CASH FLOW HEDGING STRATEGIES RELATED TO

LONG-TERM CAPITAL PURCHASES, FORWARD POINTS ARE EXCLUDED AND

EFFECTIVENESS IS MEASURED USING SPOT RATES TO VALUE BOTH THE

HEDGE CONTRACT AND THE HEDGED ITEM. FOR CURRENCY OPTIONS AND

EQUITY OPTIONS ACCOUNTED FOR AS CASH FLOW HEDGES, EFFECTIVENESS

IS MEASURED BY COMPARING THE CUMULATIVE CHANGE IN THE HEDGE

CONTRACT WITH THE CUMULATIVE CHANGE IN THE HEDGED ITEM. FOR

CURRENCY OPTIONS AND EQUITY OPTIONS ACCOUNTED FOR AS FAIR VALUE

HEDGES, TIME VALUE IS EXCLUDED AND EFFECTIVENESS IS MEASURED

BASED ON SPOT RATES TO VALUE BOTH THE HEDGE CONTRACT AND THE

HEDGED ITEM. FOR INTEREST RATE SWAPS, EFFECTIVENESS IS MEASURED

BY COMPARING THE CHANGE IN FAIR VALUE OF THE HEDGED ITEM WITH

THE CHANGE IN FAIR VALUE OF THE INTEREST RATE SWAP.

ANY INEFFECTIVE PORTION OF THE HEDGES, AS WELL AS AMOUNTS

EXCLUDED FROM THE ASSESSMENT OF EFFECTIVENESS, ARE RECOGNIZED

CURRENTLY IN EARNINGS WITHIN THE SAME INCOME STATEMENT LINE ITEM

AS THE UNDERLYING HEDGED TRANSACTION. IF A CASH FLOW HEDGE WERE

TO BE DISCONTINUED BECAUSE IT IS NOT PROBABLE THAT THE ORIGINAL

HEDGED TRANSACTION WILL OCCUR AS ANTICIPATED, THE UNREALIZED

GAIN OR LOSS ON THE RELATED DERIVATIVE WOULD BE RECLASSIFIED

INTO EARNINGS. SUBSEQUENT GAINS OR LOSSES ON THE RELATED

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENT WOULD BE RECOGNIZED IN INCOME IN EACH

PERIOD UNTIL THE INSTRUMENT MATURES, IS TERMINATED, IS

RE-DESIGNATED AS A QUALIFIED HEDGE OR IS SOLD.

FOR ALL PERIODS PRESENTED, THE PORTION OF HEDGING

INSTRUMENTS GAINS OR LOSSES EXCLUDED FROM THE ASSESSMENT

OF EFFECTIVENESS AND THE INEFFECTIVE PORTIONS OF HEDGES HAD AN

INSIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON EARNINGS FOR BOTH CASH FLOW AND FAIR

VALUE HEDGES. FOR ALL PERIODS PRESENTED, THERE WAS NO

SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FROM DISCONTINUED

CASH FLOW HEDGES AS A RESULT OF FORECASTED TRANSACTIONS THAT DID

NOT OCCUR. FOR 2005, $38 MILLION OF NET DEFERRED GAINS WERE

RECLASSIFIED FROM ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME TO COST

OF SALES OR OPERATING EXPENSE RELATED TO THE COMPANYS

NON-U.S.

CURRENCY

CAPITAL PURCHASE HEDGING PROGRAM AND OPERATING COST HEDGING

PROGRAM ($8 MILLION IN 2004 AND $1 MILLION IN 2003).

THE COMPANY ESTIMATES THAT LESS THAN $10 MILLION OF NET

DERIVATIVE LOSSES INCLUDED IN OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME WILL BE

RECLASSIFIED INTO EARNINGS WITHIN THE NEXT 12 MONTHS.

INVENTORIES

INVENTORY COST IS COMPUTED ON A CURRENTLY ADJUSTED STANDARD

BASIS (WHICH APPROXIMATES ACTUAL COST ON AN AVERAGE OR

FIRST-IN,

FIRST-OUT

BASIS). INVENTORY IS DETERMINED TO BE SALEABLE BASED ON A DEMAND

FORECAST WITHIN A SPECIFIC TIME HORIZON, GENERALLY SIX MONTHS OR

LESS. INVENTORY IN EXCESS OF SALEABLE AMOUNTS IS NOT VALUED AND

THE REMAINING INVENTORY IS VALUED AT THE LOWER OF COST OR

MACHINERY AND EQUIPMENT, 24 YEARS; BUILDINGS,

440 YEARS. REVIEWS ARE REGULARLY PERFORMED IF FACTS

AND CIRCUMSTANCES EXIST WHICH INDICATE THAT THE CARRYING AMOUNT

OF ASSETS MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE OR THAT THE USEFUL LIFE IS

SHORTER THAN ORIGINALLY ESTIMATED. THE COMPANY ASSESSES THE

RECOVERABILITY OF ITS ASSETS HELD FOR USE BY COMPARING THE

PROJECTED UNDISCOUNTED NET CASH FLOWS ASSOCIATED WITH THE

RELATED ASSET OR GROUP OF ASSETS OVER THEIR REMAINING LIVES

AGAINST THEIR RESPECTIVE CARRYING AMOUNTS. IMPAIRMENT, IF ANY,

IS BASED ON THE EXCESS OF THE CARRYING AMOUNT OVER THE FAIR

VALUE OF THOSE ASSETS. IF ASSETS ARE DETERMINED TO BE

RECOVERABLE, BUT THE USEFUL LIVES ARE SHORTER THAN ORIGINALLY

ESTIMATED, THE NET BOOK VALUE OF THE ASSETS IS DEPRECIATED OVER

THE NEWLY DETERMINED REMAINING USEFUL LIVES.

GOODWILL

GOODWILL IS RECORDED WHEN THE PURCHASE PRICE OF AN ACQUISITION

EXCEEDS THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF THE NET IDENTIFIED TANGIBLE

AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS ACQUIRED. THE COMPANY PERFORMS AN

IMPAIRMENT REVIEW FOR EACH REPORTING UNIT USING A FAIR VALUE

APPROACH. REPORTING UNITS MAY BE OPERATING SEGMENTS AS A WHOLE

OR AN OPERATION ONE LEVEL BELOW AN OPERATING SEGMENT, REFERRED

TO AS A COMPONENT. IN DETERMINING THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE

REPORTING UNIT, AN ALLOCATION OF THE COMPANYS

MANUFACTURING AND ASSEMBLY AND TEST ASSETS MUST BE MADE BECAUSE

OF THE INTERCHANGEABLE NATURE OF THE COMPANYS

MANUFACTURING AND ASSEMBLY AND TEST CAPACITY. THIS ALLOCATION IS

BASED ON EACH REPORTING UNITS RELATIVE PERCENTAGE

UTILIZATION OF THE MANUFACTURING AND ASSEMBLY AND TEST ASSETS.

FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION OF GOODWILL, SEE NOTE 14.

GOODWILL.

IDENTIFIED INTANGIBLE ASSETS

ACQUISITION-RELATED INTANGIBLES INCLUDE DEVELOPED TECHNOLOGY AND

26 YEARS. ALSO

INCLUDED IN ACQUISITION-RELATED

INTANGIBLES IS

COMBINATIONS. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY ASSETS PRIMARILY REPRESENT

RIGHTS ACQUIRED UNDER TECHNOLOGY LICENSES AND ARE AMORTIZED OVER

THE PERIODS OF BENEFIT, RANGING FROM

210 YEARS,

GENERALLY ON A STRAIGHT-LINE

BASIS. ALL IDENTIFIED

INTANGIBLE ASSETS ARE CLASSIFIED WITHIN OTHER ASSETS ON THE

BALANCE SHEET. IN THE QUARTER FOLLOWING THE PERIOD IN WHICH

IDENTIFIED INTANGIBLE ASSETS BECOME FULLY AMORTIZED, THE FULLY

AMORTIZED BALANCES ARE REMOVED FROM THE GROSS ASSET AND

ACCUMULATED AMORTIZATION AMOUNTS.

THE COMPANY PERFORMS A QUARTERLY REVIEW OF ITS IDENTIFIED

INTANGIBLE ASSETS TO DETERMINE IF FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES EXIST

WHICH INDICATE THAT THE USEFUL LIFE IS SHORTER THAN ORIGINALLY

ESTIMATED OR THAT THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF ASSETS MAY NOT BE

RECOVERABLE. IF SUCH FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES DO EXIST, THE

COMPANY ASSESSES THE RECOVERABILITY OF IDENTIFIED INTANGIBLE

ASSETS BY COMPARING THE PROJECTED UNDISCOUNTED NET CASH FLOWS

ASSOCIATED WITH THE RELATED ASSET OR GROUP OF ASSETS OVER THEIR

REMAINING LIVES AGAINST THEIR RESPECTIVE CARRYING AMOUNTS.

IMPAIRMENT, IF ANY, IS BASED ON THE EXCESS OF THE CARRYING

AMOUNT OVER THE FAIR VALUE OF THOSE ASSETS.

PRODUCT WARRANTY

THE COMPANY GENERALLY SELLS PRODUCTS WITH A LIMITED WARRANTY OF

PRODUCT QUALITY AND A LIMITED INDEMNIFICATION OF CUSTOMERS

AGAINST INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY INFRINGEMENT CLAIMS RELATED TO THE

COMPANYS PRODUCTS. THE COMPANY ACCRUES FOR KNOWN WARRANTY

AND INDEMNIFICATION ISSUES IF A LOSS IS PROBABLE AND CAN BE

REASONABLY ESTIMATED, AND ACCRUES FOR ESTIMATED INCURRED BUT

UNIDENTIFIED ISSUES BASED ON HISTORICAL ACTIVITY. THE ACCRUAL

AND THE RELATED EXPENSE FOR KNOWN ISSUES WERE NOT SIGNIFICANT

DURING THE PERIODS PRESENTED. DUE TO PRODUCT TESTING AND THE

SHORT TIME TYPICALLY BETWEEN PRODUCT SHIPMENT AND THE DETECTION

AND CORRECTION OF PRODUCT FAILURES, AND CONSIDERING THE

HISTORICAL RATE OF PAYMENTS ON INDEMNIFICATION CLAIMS, THE

ACCRUAL AND RELATED EXPENSE FOR ESTIMATED INCURRED BUT

UNIDENTIFIED ISSUES WERE NOT SIGNIFICANT DURING THE PERIODS

PRESENTED.

REVENUE RECOGNITION

THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES NET REVENUE WHEN THE EARNINGS PROCESS IS

COMPLETE, AS EVIDENCED BY AN AGREEMENT WITH THE CUSTOMER,

TRANSFER OF TITLE AND ACCEPTANCE, IF APPLICABLE, AS WELL AS

FIXED PRICING AND PROBABLE COLLECTIBILITY. PRICING ALLOWANCES,

INCLUDING DISCOUNTS BASED ON CONTRACTUAL ARRANGEMENTS WITH

CUSTOMERS, ARE RECORDED WHEN REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED AS A

REDUCTION TO BOTH ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND REVENUE. BECAUSE OF

FREQUENT SALES PRICE REDUCTIONS AND RAPID TECHNOLOGY

OBSOLESCENCE IN THE INDUSTRY, SALES MADE TO DISTRIBUTORS UNDER

AGREEMENTS ALLOWING PRICE PROTECTION AND/OR RIGHT OF RETURN ARE

DEFERRED UNTIL THE DISTRIBUTORS SELL THE MERCHANDISE. SHIPPING

CHARGES BILLED TO CUSTOMERS ARE INCLUDED IN NET REVENUE, AND THE

RELATED SHIPPING COSTS ARE INCLUDED IN COST OF SALES.

ADVERTISING

COOPERATIVE ADVERTISING PROGRAMS REIMBURSE CUSTOMERS FOR

MARKETING ACTIVITIES FOR CERTAIN OF THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS,

SUBJECT TO DEFINED CRITERIA. COOPERATIVE ADVERTISING OBLIGATIONS

ARE ACCRUED AND THE COSTS EXPENSED AT THE SAME TIME THE RELATED

REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED. ALL OTHER ADVERTISING COSTS ARE EXPENSED

AS INCURRED. COOPERATIVE ADVERTISING EXPENSES ARE RECORDED AS

MARKETING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE TO THE EXTENT THAT

AN ADVERTISING BENEFIT SEPARATE FROM THE REVENUE TRANSACTION CAN

BE IDENTIFIED AND THE CASH PAID DOES NOT EXCEED THE FAIR VALUE

OF THAT ADVERTISING BENEFIT RECEIVED. ANY EXCESS OF CASH PAID

OVER THE FAIR VALUE OF THE ADVERTISING BENEFIT RECEIVED IS

RECORDED AS A REDUCTION IN REVENUE. ADVERTISING EXPENSE WAS

$2.6 BILLION IN 2005 ($2.1 BILLION IN 2004 AND

$1.8 BILLION IN 2003).

EMPLOYEE EQUITY INCENTIVE PLANS

THE COMPANY HAS EMPLOYEE EQUITY INCENTIVE PLANS, WHICH ARE

DESCRIBED MORE FULLY IN NOTE 11: EMPLOYEE EQUITY

INCENTIVE PLANS. DURING THE THREE YEARS ENDED

DECEMBER 31, 2005, THE COMPANY ACCOUNTED FOR ITS EQUITY

INCENTIVE PLANS UNDER THE INTRINSIC VALUE RECOGNITION AND

MEASUREMENT PRINCIPLES OF ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES BOARD (APB)

OPINION NO. 25, ACCOUNTING FOR STOCK ISSUED TO

EMPLOYEES, AND RELATED INTERPRETATIONS. THE EXERCISE PRICE

OF OPTIONS IS EQUAL TO THE MARKET PRICE OF INTEL COMMON STOCK

(DEFINED AS THE AVERAGE OF THE HIGH AND LOW TRADING PRICES

REPORTED BY THE NASDAQ STOCK MARKET*) ON THE DATE OF GRANT.

ACCORDINGLY, NO SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION, OTHER THAN

INSIGNIFICANT AMOUNTS OF ACQUISITION-RELATED SHARE-BASED

COMPENSATION, WAS RECOGNIZED IN NET INCOME.

THE TABLE BELOW ILLUSTRATES THE EFFECT ON NET INCOME AND

EARNINGS PER SHARE AS IF THE COMPANY HAD APPLIED THE FAIR VALUE

RECOGNITION PROVISIONS OF STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING

STANDARDS (SFAS) NO. 123, ACCOUNTING FOR STOCK-BASED

COMPENSATION, TO OPTIONS GRANTED UNDER THE COMPANYS

EQUITY INCENTIVE PLANS AND RIGHTS TO ACQUIRE STOCK GRANTED UNDER

THE COMPANYS STOCK PARTICIPATION PLAN. FOR PURPOSES OF

THIS PRO FORMA DISCLOSURE, THE VALUE OF THE OPTIONS AND RIGHTS

TO ACQUIRE STOCK GRANTED UNDER THE COMPANYS STOCK

PARTICIPATION PLAN ARE ESTIMATED USING A BLACK-SCHOLES OPTION

PRICING MODEL AND AMORTIZED RATABLY OVER THE VESTING PERIODS.

BECAUSE THE ESTIMATED VALUE IS DETERMINED AS OF THE DATE OF

GRANT, THE ACTUAL VALUE ULTIMATELY REALIZED BY THE EMPLOYEE MAY

BE SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT.

IN LIGHT OF STAFF ACCOUNTING BULLETIN (SAB) 107 OF THE

U.S. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (SEC), ISSUED IN

THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2005, THE COMPANY REEVALUATED THE

ASSUMPTIONS USED TO ESTIMATE THE VALUE OF EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTIONS

GRANTED. MANAGEMENT DETERMINED THAT IMPLIED VOLATILITY IS MORE

REFLECTIVE OF MARKET CONDITIONS AND A BETTER INDICATOR OF

EXPECTED VOLATILITY THAN HISTORICAL VOLATILITY. ADDITIONALLY, IN

2005, THE COMPANY BEGAN USING THE SIMPLIFIED CALCULATION OF

EXPECTED LIFE, DESCRIBED IN SAB 107, DUE TO CHANGES IN THE

VESTING TERMS AND CONTRACTUAL LIFE OF CURRENT OPTION GRANTS

COMPARED TO THE COMPANYS HISTORICAL GRANTS. MANAGEMENT

BELIEVES THAT THIS CALCULATION PROVIDES A REASONABLE ESTIMATE OF

EXPECTED LIFE FOR THE COMPANYS EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTIONS. NO

ADJUSTMENTS TO THE 2004 AND 2003 INPUT ASSUMPTIONS HAVE BEEN

MADE.

RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

IN DECEMBER 2004, THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD

(FASB) ISSUED SFAS NO. 123(R).

SFAS NO. 123(R) REQUIRES EMPLOYEE SHARE-BASED EQUITY

AWARDS TO BE ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER THE FAIR VALUE METHOD, AND

ELIMINATES THE ABILITY TO ACCOUNT FOR THESE INSTRUMENTS UNDER

THE INTRINSIC VALUE METHOD PRESCRIBED BY APB OPINION NO. 25

AND ALLOWED UNDER THE ORIGINAL PROVISIONS OF

SFAS NO. 123. SFAS NO. 123(R) REQUIRES THE

USE OF AN OPTION PRICING MODEL FOR ESTIMATING FAIR VALUE, WHICH

IS THEN AMORTIZED TO EXPENSE OVER THE SERVICE PERIODS. IF THE

COMPANY HAD APPLIED THE PROVISIONS OF SFAS NO. 123(R)

TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR 2005, NET INCOME WOULD HAVE BEEN

REDUCED BY APPROXIMATELY $1.3 BILLION.

SFAS NO. 123(R) ALLOWS FOR EITHER PROSPECTIVE

RECOGNITION OF COMPENSATION EXPENSE OR RETROSPECTIVE

RECOGNITION. IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2006, THE COMPANY BEGAN TO

APPLY THE PROSPECTIVE RECOGNITION METHOD AND IMPLEMENTED THE

PROVISIONS OF SFAS

NO. 123(R).

THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE NUMBER OF COMMON SHARES OUTSTANDING DURING

THE PERIOD. DILUTED EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE IS COMPUTED USING

NET INCOME AND THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE NUMBER OF COMMON SHARES

OUTSTANDING AND POTENTIALLY DILUTIVE COMMON SHARES OUTSTANDING

DURING THE PERIOD. POTENTIALLY DILUTIVE COMMON SHARES INCLUDE

THE ASSUMED EXERCISE OF STOCK OPTIONS USING THE TREASURY STOCK

METHOD, AS WELL AS THE ASSUMED CONVERSION OF DEBT USING THE

IF-CONVERTED METHOD. THE IF-CONVERTED METHOD ALSO REQUIRES THAT

NET INCOME BE ADJUSTED FOR THE INTEREST EXPENSE FROM CONVERTIBLE

DEBT, NET OF TAX, RECOGNIZED IN THE INCOME STATEMENT IN THE

PERIOD. IN 2005, INTEREST EXPENSE RELATED TO CONVERTIBLE DEBT

WAS CAPITALIZED, ALTHOUGH INSIGNIFICANT. THE ABOVE CALCULATIONS

ARE PRESCRIBED BY SFAS NO. 128, EARNINGS PER

SHARE.

FOR 2005, 372 MILLION OF THE COMPANYS OUTSTANDING

STOCK OPTIONS WERE EXCLUDED FROM THE CALCULATION OF DILUTED

EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE BECAUSE THE EXERCISE PRICES OF THESE

STOCK OPTIONS WERE GREATER THAN OR EQUAL TO THE AVERAGE MARKET

VALUE OF THE COMMON SHARES, AND THEREFORE THEIR INCLUSION WOULD

HAVE BEEN ANTI-DILUTIVE (357 MILLION IN 2004 AND

418 MILLION IN 2003). THESE OPTIONS COULD BE DILUTIVE IN

THE FUTURE IF THE AVERAGE MARKET VALUE OF THE COMMON SHARES

INCREASES AND IS GREATER THAN THE EXERCISE PRICE OF THESE

OPTIONS. THE DILUTIVE EFFECT OF CONVERTIBLE DEBT IN 2005 WAS

MINIMIZED BY THE TIMING OF THE RELATED DEBT ISSUANCE. SEE

NOTE 5: BORROWINGS.

NOTE 4.

COMMON STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM

THE COMPANY HAS AN ONGOING AUTHORIZATION, AS AMENDED IN NOVEMBER

2005, FROM THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS TO REPURCHASE UP TO

$25 BILLION IN SHARES OF INTELS COMMON STOCK IN OPEN

MARKET OR NEGOTIATED TRANSACTIONS. THE RECENT AUTHORIZATION

INCLUDES THE REMAINING SHARES AVAILABLE FOR REPURCHASE UNDER

PREVIOUS AUTHORIZATIONS, WHICH WERE EXPRESSED AS SHARE AMOUNTS.

DURING 2005, THE COMPANY REPURCHASED 418 MILLION SHARES OF

COMMON STOCK AT A COST OF $10.6 BILLION (301 MILLION

SHARES AT A COST OF $7.5 BILLION DURING 2004 AND

176 MILLION SHARES AT A COST OF $4.0 BILLION DURING

2003). SINCE THE PROGRAM BEGAN IN 1990, THE COMPANY HAS

REPURCHASED AND RETIRED 2.6 BILLION SHARES AT A COST OF

APPROXIMATELY $52 BILLION. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2005,

$21.9 BILLION REMAINED AVAILABLE FOR REPURCHASE UNDER THE

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

IN DECEMBER 2005, THE COMPANY ISSUED $1.6 BILLION OF 2.95%

JUNIOR SUBORDINATED CONVERTIBLE DEBENTURES (THE DEBENTURES) DUE

2035. THE DEBENTURES ARE INITIALLY CONVERTIBLE, SUBJECT TO

CERTAIN CONDITIONS, INTO SHARES OF THE COMPANYS COMMON

STOCK AT A CONVERSION RATE OF 31.7162 SHARES OF COMMON

STOCK PER $1,000 PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF DEBENTURES, REPRESENTING AN

INITIAL EFFECTIVE CONVERSION PRICE OF APPROXIMATELY

$31.53 PER SHARE OF COMMON STOCK. HOLDERS MAY SURRENDER THE

DEBENTURES FOR CONVERSION AT ANY TIME. THE CONVERSION RATE WILL

BE SUBJECT TO ADJUSTMENT FOR CERTAIN EVENTS OUTLINED IN THE

INDENTURE GOVERNING THE DEBENTURES BUT WILL NOT BE ADJUSTED FOR

ACCRUED INTEREST. IN ADDITION, THE CONVERSION RATE WILL INCREASE

FOR A HOLDER WHO ELECTS TO CONVERT THE DEBENTURES IN CONNECTION

WITH CERTAIN CHANGES. THE DEBENTURES, WHICH PAY A FIXED RATE OF

INTEREST SEMIANNUALLY BEGINNING ON JUNE 15, 2006, HAVE A

CONTINGENT INTEREST COMPONENT THAT WILL REQUIRE THE COMPANY TO

PAY INTEREST BASED ON CERTAIN THRESHOLDS AND FOR CERTAIN EVENTS

COMMENCING ON DECEMBER 15, 2010, AS OUTLINED IN THE

INDENTURE GOVERNING THE DEBENTURES. THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT OF

CONTINGENT INTEREST THAT WILL ACCRUE IS 0.40% PER YEAR. THE

FAIR VALUE OF THE RELATED EMBEDDED DERIVATIVES WAS NOT

SIGNIFICANT AT DECEMBER 31, 2005. THE COMPANY MAY SETTLE

ANY CONVERSIONS OF THE DEBENTURES IN CASH OR STOCK AT THE

COMPANYS OPTION. ON OR AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2012, THE

COMPANY MAY REDEEM ALL OR PART OF THE DEBENTURES FOR THE

PRINCIPAL AMOUNT PLUS ANY ACCRUED AND UNPAID INTEREST IF THE

CLOSING PRICE OF THE COMPANYS COMMON STOCK HAS BEEN AT

LEAST 130% OF THE CONVERSION PRICE THEN IN EFFECT FOR AT LEAST

20 TRADING DAYS DURING ANY 30 CONSECUTIVE TRADING-DAY PERIOD

PRIOR TO THE DATE ON WHICH THE COMPANY PROVIDES NOTICE OF

REDEMPTION. IF CERTAIN CHANGE EVENTS OCCUR IN THE FUTURE, THE

INDENTURE PROVIDES THAT EACH HOLDER OF THE DEBENTURES MAY, FOR A

PRE-DEFINED PERIOD OF TIME, REQUIRE THE COMPANY TO REPURCHASE

THE HOLDERS DEBENTURES FOR THE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT PLUS ANY

ACCRUED AND UNPAID INTEREST. THE COMPANY MAY PAY THE REPURCHASE

PRICE IN CASH OR IN SHARES OF THE COMPANYS COMMON STOCK.

IN ADDITION, ON OR PRIOR TO JUNE 12, 2006, THE COMPANY MAY

REDEEM ALL OR PART OF THE DEBENTURES FOR CASH AT A PREMIUM IF

CERTAIN U.S. FEDERAL TAX LEGISLATION, REGULATIONS OR RULES

ARE ENACTED OR ARE ISSUED. THE DEBENTURES ARE SUBORDINATED IN

RIGHT OF PAYMENT TO THE COMPANYS EXISTING AND FUTURE

SENIOR DEBT AND TO THE OTHER LIABILITIES OF THE COMPANYS

SUBSIDIARIES. THE DEBENTURES WILL BE USED TO PROVIDE FUNDS FOR

GENERAL CORPORATE PURPOSES. THE COMPANY MAY ALSO USE A PORTION

OF THE PROCEEDS TO PURCHASE SHARES OF INTEL COMMON STOCK.

THE COMPANY HAS GUARANTEED REPAYMENT OF PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST

ON BONDS ISSUED BY THE INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY OF THE

CITY OF CHANDLER, ARIZONA (THE ARIZONA BONDS), WHICH CONSTITUTE

AN UNSECURED GENERAL OBLIGATION OF THE COMPANY. THE AGGREGATE

PRINCIPAL AMOUNT, INCLUDING PREMIUM, OF THE ARIZONA BONDS ISSUED

DECEMBER 2005 IS $160 MILLION DUE 2035, AND THE BONDS WILL

BEAR INTEREST AT A FIXED RATE OF 4.375% UNTIL 2010. THE ARIZONA

BONDS ARE SUBJECT TO MANDATORY TENDER ON NOVEMBER 30, 2010,

AT WHICH TIME, AT THE COMPANYS OPTION, THE BONDS CAN BE

RE-MARKETED AS EITHER FIXED-RATE BONDS FOR A PERIOD OF A

SPECIFIED DURATION OR AS VARIABLE-RATE BONDS UNTIL THEIR FINAL

MATURITY ON DECEMBER 1, 2035. THE PROCEEDS FROM THE

ISSUANCE OF THESE BONDS WILL BE USED TO PROVIDE FUNDS TO FINANCE

THE COSTS OF ACQUISITION, CONSTRUCTION AND INSTALLATION OF

CERTAIN INDUSTRIAL SEWAGE AND WASTEWATER TREATMENT FACILITIES

AND SOLID WASTE DISPOSAL FACILITIES AS PART OF THE

COMPANYS SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING PLANT LOCATED IN THE

CITY OF CHANDLER, ARIZONA.

THE COMPANY HAS EURO BORROWINGS MADE IN CONNECTION WITH THE

FINANCING OF MANUFACTURING FACILITIES AND EQUIPMENT IN IRELAND.

THE COMPANY INVESTED THE PROCEEDS IN EURO-DENOMINATED LOAN

PARTICIPATION NOTES OF SIMILAR MATURITY TO HEDGE CURRENCY AND

INTEREST RATE EXPOSURES. DURING 2005, THE COMPANY RETIRED

APPROXIMATELY $280 MILLION OF THE EURO BORROWINGS

(APPROXIMATELY $270 MILLION DURING 2004) PRIOR TO THEIR

MATURITY DATES THROUGH THE SIMULTANEOUS SETTLEMENT OF AN

EQUIVALENT AMOUNT OF INVESTMENTS IN LOAN PARTICIPATION NOTES

(SEE NOTE 8: INTEREST AND OTHER, NET).

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2005, AGGREGATE DEBT MATURITIES WERE AS

FOLLOWS: 2006$18 MILLION; 2007$20 MILLION;

2008$97 MILLION; 2009$20 MILLION;

2010$184 MILLION; AND

NET GAINS (LOSSES) FOR THE PERIOD ON FIXED-INCOME DEBT

INSTRUMENTS CLASSIFIED AS TRADING ASSETS STILL HELD AT THE

REPORTING DATE WERE $(47) MILLION IN 2005 ($80 MILLION

THE RELATED DERIVATIVES WERE $52 MILLION IN 2005

($(77) MILLION IN 2004 AND $(192) MILLION IN 2003).

THESE AMOUNTS WERE INCLUDED IN INTEREST AND OTHER, NET IN THE

CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME.

CERTAIN EQUITY SECURITIES WITHIN THE TRADING ASSET PORTFOLIO ARE

MAINTAINED TO GENERATE RETURNS THAT SEEK TO OFFSET CHANGES IN

LIABILITIES RELATED TO THE EQUITY MARKET RISK OF CERTAIN

DEFERRED COMPENSATION ARRANGEMENTS. THESE DEFERRED COMPENSATION

LIABILITIES WERE $316 MILLION IN 2005 ($458 MILLION IN

2004), AND ARE INCLUDED IN OTHER ACCRUED LIABILITIES ON THE

CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS. THE DECREASE IN 2005 WAS PRIMARILY

RELATED TO AN AMENDMENT OF THE COMPANYS

U.S. DEFINED-BENEFIT PLAN, WHICH RESULTED IN A TRANSFER OF

DEFERRED COMPENSATION LIABILITIES TO THE PLAN (SEE

NOTE 12: RETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS). NET GAINS

FOR THE PERIOD ON EQUITY SECURITIES OFFSETTING DEFERRED

COMPENSATION ARRANGEMENTS STILL HELD AT THE REPORTING DATE WERE

($29 MILLION IN 2004 AND $52 MILLION IN 2003).

PRIOR TO 2004, THE COMPANY HELD CERTAIN OTHER MARKETABLE EQUITY

SECURITIES THAT WERE INCLUDED IN TRADING ASSETS. NET GAINS FOR

THE PERIOD ON THESE EQUITY SECURITY TRADING ASSETS STILL HELD AT

THE REPORTING DATE WERE $77 MILLION IN 2003. NET LOSSES ON

THE RELATED DERIVATIVES WERE $84 MILLION IN 2003. THESE

GAINS AND LOSSES WERE INCLUDED WITHIN LOSSES ON EQUITY

THE DURATION OF THE UNREALIZED LOSSES ON AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE

INVESTMENTS AT DECEMBER 31, 2005 AND DECEMBER 25, 2004

DID NOT EXCEED 12 MONTHS. THE COMPANYS UNREALIZED

LOSSES OF $51 MILLION ON INVESTMENTS IN MARKETABLE

STRATEGIC EQUITY SECURITIES AT DECEMBER 25, 2004 RELATED

PRIMARILY TO THE COMPANYS INVESTMENT IN MICRON TECHNOLOGY,

INC. THE UNREALIZED LOSSES WERE DUE TO MARKET-PRICE MOVEMENTS.

MANAGEMENT DOES NOT BELIEVE THAT ANY OF THE UNREALIZED LOSSES

REPRESENTED AN OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENT BASED ON ITS

EVALUATION OF AVAILABLE EVIDENCE AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2005

AND DECEMBER 25, 2004. HOWEVER, DURING 2005, THE COMPANY

TOOK AN IMPAIRMENT CHARGE ON ITS INVESTMENT IN MICRON FOR

$105 MILLION REFLECTING THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE COST

BASIS OF THE INVESTMENT AND THE PRICE OF MICRONS STOCK AT

THE END OF THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2005. THE IMPAIRMENT WAS

PRINCIPALLY BASED ON MANAGEMENTS ASSESSMENT OF

MICRONS FINANCIAL RESULTS AND THE FACT THAT THE MARKET

PRICE OF MICRONS STOCK HAD BEEN BELOW THE COMPANYS

COST BASIS FOR AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF TIME, AS WELL AS THE

COMPETITIVE PRICING ENVIRONMENT FOR DYNAMIC RANDOM ACCESS MEMORY

(DRAM) PRODUCTS. THE INVESTMENT IN MICRON IS PART OF THE

COMPANYS STRATEGY TO SUPPORT THE DEVELOPMENT AND SUPPLY OF

DRAM PRODUCTS.

THE COMPANY SOLD AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE SECURITIES WITH A FAIR VALUE

AT THE DATE OF SALE OF $1.7 BILLION IN 2005

($1.1 BILLION IN 2004 AND $865 MILLION IN 2003). THE

GROSS REALIZED GAINS ON THESE SALES TOTALED $96 MILLION IN

2005 ($52 MILLION IN 2004 AND $16 MILLION IN 2003).

FOR ALL PERIODS PRESENTED, GROSS REALIZED LOSSES ON SALES, AND

GAINS ON SHARES EXCHANGED IN THIRD-PARTY MERGER TRANSACTIONS

WERE INSIGNIFICANT. THE COMPANY RECOGNIZED IMPAIRMENT LOSSES ON

AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE INVESTMENTS OF $105 MILLION IN 2005

NOTE 7: CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS THAT POTENTIALLY SUBJECT THE COMPANY TO

CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK CONSIST PRINCIPALLY OF INVESTMENTS

IN DEBT SECURITIES, DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND TRADE

RECEIVABLES.

INTEL GENERALLY PLACES ITS INVESTMENTS WITH HIGH-CREDIT-QUALITY

COUNTERPARTIES AND, BY POLICY, LIMITS THE AMOUNT OF CREDIT

EXPOSURE TO ANY ONE COUNTERPARTY BASED ON INTELS ANALYSIS

OF THAT COUNTERPARTYS RELATIVE CREDIT STANDING.

INVESTMENTS IN DEBT SECURITIES WITH ORIGINAL MATURITIES OF

GREATER THAN SIX MONTHS CONSIST PRIMARILY OF A AND A2 OR BETTER

RATED FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND COUNTERPARTIES. INVESTMENTS WITH

ORIGINAL MATURITIES OF UP TO SIX MONTHS CONSIST PRIMARILY OF

A-1

AND

P-1

OR BETTER RATED

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND COUNTERPARTIES. GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS

IMPOSED ON INVESTMENT ALTERNATIVES OF INTELS

NON-U.S.

SUBSIDIARIES,

OR THE ABSENCE OF A AND A2 RATED COUNTERPARTIES IN CERTAIN

COUNTRIES, RESULT IN SOME MINOR EXCEPTIONS, WHICH ARE REVIEWED

AND APPROVED ANNUALLY BY THE FINANCE COMMITTEE OF THE BOARD OF

DIRECTORS. CREDIT RATING CRITERIA FOR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS ARE

SIMILAR TO THOSE FOR INVESTMENTS. THE AMOUNTS SUBJECT TO CREDIT

RISK RELATED TO DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS ARE GENERALLY LIMITED TO

THE AMOUNTS, IF ANY, BY WHICH A COUNTERPARTYS OBLIGATIONS

EXCEED THE OBLIGATIONS OF INTEL WITH THAT COUNTERPARTY. AT

DECEMBER 31, 2005, THE TOTAL CREDIT EXPOSURE TO ANY SINGLE

COUNTERPARTY DID NOT EXCEED $365 MILLION. INTELS

PRACTICE IS TO OBTAIN AND SECURE AVAILABLE COLLATERAL FROM

COUNTERPARTIES AGAINST OBLIGATIONS, INCLUDING SECURITIES LENDING

TRANSACTIONS, WHENEVER INTEL DEEMS APPROPRIATE.

THE MAJORITY OF THE COMPANYS TRADE RECEIVABLES ARE DERIVED

FROM SALES TO ORIGINAL EQUIPMENT MANUFACTURERS AND ORIGINAL

DESIGN MANUFACTURERS OF COMPUTER SYSTEMS, CELLULAR HANDSETS AND

HANDHELD COMPUTING DEVICES, AND NETWORKING AND COMMUNICATIONS

EQUIPMENT. THE COMPANY ALSO HAS ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE DERIVED FROM

SALES TO INDUSTRIAL AND RETAIL DISTRIBUTORS. THE COMPANYS

TWO LARGEST CUSTOMERS ACCOUNTED FOR 35% OF NET REVENUE FOR 2005

AND 2004, AND 34% OF NET REVENUE FOR 2003. AT DECEMBER 31,

2005, THE TWO LARGEST CUSTOMERS ACCOUNTED FOR 42% OF NET

ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE (34% OF NET ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AT

DECEMBER 25, 2004). MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT THE RECEIVABLE

BALANCES FROM THESE LARGEST CUSTOMERS DO NOT REPRESENT A

SIGNIFICANT CREDIT RISK BASED ON CASH FLOW FORECASTS, BALANCE

SHEET ANALYSIS AND PAST COLLECTION EXPERIENCE.

THE COMPANY HAS ADOPTED CREDIT POLICIES AND STANDARDS INTENDED

TO ACCOMMODATE INDUSTRY GROWTH AND INHERENT RISK. MANAGEMENT

BELIEVES THAT CREDIT RISKS ARE MODERATED BY THE FINANCIAL

STABILITY OF THE COMPANYS END CUSTOMERS AND DIVERSE

GEOGRAPHIC SALES AREAS. TO ASSESS THE CREDIT RISK OF

COUNTERPARTIES, A QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE ANALYSIS IS

PERFORMED. FROM THIS ANALYSIS, CREDIT LIMITS ARE ESTABLISHED AND

A DETERMINATION IS MADE AS TO WHETHER ONE OR MORE CREDIT SUPPORT

DEVICES, SUCH AS OBTAINING SOME FORM OF THIRD-PARTY GUARANTEE OR

STANDBY LETTER OF CREDIT, OR OBTAINING CREDIT INSURANCE, FOR ALL

OR A PORTION OF THE ACCOUNT BALANCE IS NECESSARY.

THE AMERICAN JOBS CREATION ACT OF 2004 (THE JOBS ACT) CREATED A

TEMPORARY INCENTIVE FOR U.S. CORPORATIONS TO REPATRIATE

ACCUMULATED INCOME EARNED ABROAD BY PROVIDING AN 85%

DIVIDENDS-RECEIVED DEDUCTION FOR CERTAIN DIVIDENDS FROM

CONTROLLED

NON-U.S.

CORPORATIONS.

DURING 2005, THE COMPANYS CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND

BOARD OF DIRECTORS APPROVED A DOMESTIC REINVESTMENT PLAN, UNDER

WHICH THE COMPANY REPATRIATED $6.2 BILLION IN EARNINGS

OUTSIDE THE U.S. PURSUANT TO THE JOBS ACT. THE COMPANY

RECORDED ADDITIONAL TAX EXPENSE IN 2005 OF APPROXIMATELY

$265 MILLION ($0.04 PER COMMON SHARE, ASSUMING

DILUTION) RELATED TO THIS DECISION TO REPATRIATE

NON-U.S.

EARNINGS.

THIS REPATRIATION INCREASED THE COMPANYS EFFECTIVE RATE

FOR 2005 BY APPROXIMATELY 2.1 PERCENTAGE POINTS, TO 31.3%.

THE MAJORITY OF THIS INCREASE, 1.8%, IS REFLECTED AS A SEPARATE

LINE ITEM IN THE RATE RECONCILIATION TABLE ABOVE, REPRESENTING

THE RATE EFFECT OF THE REPATRIATION OF PRIOR YEARS

PERMANENTLY REINVESTED EARNINGS. THE REMAINDER REPRESENTS THE

RATE EFFECT OF THE REPATRIATION OF THE CURRENT YEARS

INTEL CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

DURING 2004, IN CONNECTION WITH PREPARING AND FILING ITS 2003

FEDERAL TAX RETURN AND PREPARING ITS STATE TAX RETURNS, THE

COMPANY REDUCED ITS 2004 TAX PROVISION BY $195 MILLION.

THIS REDUCTION IN THE 2004 TAX PROVISION WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY

TAX BENEFITS FOR EXPORT SALES AND STATE TAX BENEFITS FOR

DIVESTITURES THAT EXCEEDED THE AMOUNTS ORIGINALLY ESTIMATED IN

CONNECTION WITH THE 2003 PROVISION. ALSO DURING 2004, THE

COMPANY REVERSED PREVIOUSLY ACCRUED TAXES RELATED PRIMARILY TO

THE CLOSING OF A STATE INCOME TAX AUDIT THAT REDUCED THE TAX

PROVISION FOR 2004 BY $62 MILLION.

THE COMPANY REDUCED ITS TAX PROVISION FOR 2003 BY APPROXIMATELY

$758 MILLION DUE TO THE TAX BENEFITS RELATED TO THE SALE OF

CERTAIN BUSINESSES AND ASSETS THROUGH THE SALE OF STOCK OF

ACQUIRED COMPANIES (SEE NOTE 13: ACQUISITIONS AND

DIVESTITURES).

THE U.S. INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE (IRS) FORMALLY ASSESSED

CERTAIN ADJUSTMENTS TO THE AMOUNTS REFLECTED BY THE COMPANY IN

ITS TAX RETURNS FOR THE YEARS 1999 THROUGH 2002. SEE

NOTE 18: CONTINGENCIES FOR A DISCUSSION OF

THESE MATTERS.

DEFERRED INCOME TAXES REFLECT THE NET TAX EFFECTS OF TEMPORARY

DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF ASSETS AND

LIABILITIES FOR FINANCIAL REPORTING PURPOSES AND THE AMOUNTS FOR

INCOME TAX PURPOSES. SIGNIFICANT COMPONENTS OF THE

COMPANYS DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AT FISCAL

DURING 2004, THE COMPANY RECLASSIFIED $445 MILLION FROM

DEFERRED TAX LIABILITIES TO COMMON STOCK AND CAPITAL STOCK IN

EXCESS OF PAR VALUE. THE BALANCE SHEET RECLASSIFICATION

REPRESENTED THE TAX BENEFIT ATTRIBUTABLE TO CERTAIN PRIOR-YEAR

STOCK OPTION EXERCISES BY

NON-U.S.

EMPLOYEES

AND HAD NO IMPACT ON THE ACCOMPANYING STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS.

U.S. INCOME TAXES WERE NOT PROVIDED FOR ON A CUMULATIVE

TOTAL OF APPROXIMATELY $3.7 BILLION OF UNDISTRIBUTED

NON-U.S.

SUBSIDIARIES.

DETERMINATION OF THE AMOUNT OF UNRECOGNIZED DEFERRED TAX

LIABILITY FOR TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES RELATED TO INVESTMENTS IN

THESE

NON-U.S.

THAT ARE ESSENTIALLY PERMANENT IN DURATION IS NOT PRACTICABLE.

THE COMPANY CURRENTLY INTENDS TO REINVEST THESE EARNINGS IN

OPERATIONS OUTSIDE THE U.S.

NOTE 11: EMPLOYEE EQUITY INCENTIVE PLANS

STOCK OPTION PLANS

UNDER THE 2004 EQUITY INCENTIVE PLAN (THE 2004 PLAN), OPTIONS TO

PURCHASE SHARES MAY BE GRANTED TO ALL EMPLOYEES AND NON-EMPLOYEE

CORPORATION 1984 STOCK OPTION PLAN EXPIRED IN MAY 2004, AND THE

INTEL CORPORATION 1997 STOCK OPTION PLAN WAS TERMINATED UPON

STOCKHOLDER APPROVAL OF THE 2004 PLAN. AS OF DECEMBER 31,

2005, SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE COMPANYS EMPLOYEES WERE

PARTICIPATING IN ONE OF THE STOCK OPTION PLANS. OPTIONS GRANTED

BY THE COMPANY UNDER THE 2004 PLAN GENERALLY EXPIRE SEVEN YEARS

HAS A STOCK PARTICIPATION PLAN UNDER WHICH ELIGIBLE EMPLOYEES

MAY PURCHASE SHARES OF INTELS COMMON STOCK AT 85% OF THE

AVERAGE OF THE HIGH AND LOW STOCK PRICE REPORTED ON THE NASDAQ

STOCK MARKET AT SPECIFIC, PREDETERMINED DATES. APPROXIMATELY 70%

OF THE COMPANYS EMPLOYEES WERE PARTICIPATING IN THE STOCK

PARTICIPATION PLAN AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2005. OF THE

944 MILLION SHARES AUTHORIZED TO BE ISSUED UNDER THE PLAN,

47.9 MILLION SHARES REMAINED AVAILABLE FOR ISSUANCE AT

DECEMBER 31, 2005. EMPLOYEES PURCHASED 19.6 MILLION

SHARES IN 2005 (18.4 MILLION IN 2004 AND 23.8 MILLION

IN 2003) FOR $387 MILLION ($367 MILLION IN 2004 AND

$328 MILLION IN 2003).

NOTE 12.

RETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS

PROFIT SHARING PLANS

THE COMPANY PROVIDES TAX-QUALIFIED PROFIT SHARING RETIREMENT

PLANS FOR THE BENEFIT OF ELIGIBLE EMPLOYEES, FORMER EMPLOYEES

AND RETIREES IN THE U.S. AND CERTAIN OTHER COUNTRIES. THE PLANS

ARE DESIGNED TO PROVIDE EMPLOYEES WITH AN ACCUMULATION OF FUNDS

FOR RETIREMENT ON A TAX-DEFERRED BASIS AND PROVIDE FOR ANNUAL

DISCRETIONARY EMPLOYER CONTRIBUTIONS. AMOUNTS TO BE CONTRIBUTED

TO THE U.S. PROFIT SHARING PLAN ARE DETERMINED BY THE CHIEF

EXECUTIVE OFFICER OF THE COMPANY UNDER DELEGATION OF AUTHORITY

FROM THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS, PURSUANT TO THE TERMS OF THE PROFIT

SHARING PLAN. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2005, APPROXIMATELY 90% OF

THE ASSETS OF THE U.S. PROFIT SHARING PLAN HAD BEEN

ALLOCATED TO DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL EQUITY INDEX FUNDS AND

APPROXIMATELY 10% HAD BEEN ALLOCATED TO A FIXED INCOME FUND. ALL

ASSETS ARE MANAGED BY AN OUTSIDE FUND MANAGER, CONSISTENT WITH

THE INVESTMENT POLICY.

THE COMPANY ALSO PROVIDES A NON-QUALIFIED PROFIT SHARING

RETIREMENT PLAN (SERPLUS) FOR THE BENEFIT OF ELIGIBLE EMPLOYEES

IN THE U.S. THIS PLAN IS DESIGNED TO PERMIT CERTAIN

DISCRETIONARY EMPLOYER CONTRIBUTIONS AND TO PERMIT EMPLOYEE

DEFERRAL OF A PORTION OF SALARIES IN EXCESS OF CERTAIN TAX

LIMITS AND DEFERRAL OF BONUSES. THIS PLAN IS UNFUNDED.

THE COMPANY EXPENSED $355 MILLION FOR THE QUALIFIED AND

NON-QUALIFIED U.S. PROFIT SHARING RETIREMENT PLANS IN 2005

($323 MILLION IN 2004 AND $302 MILLION IN 2003). THE

COMPANY EXPECTS TO FUND APPROXIMATELY $320 MILLION FOR THE

2005 CONTRIBUTION TO THE U.S. QUALIFIED PROFIT SHARING PLAN

AND LESS THAN $10 MILLION FOR SERPLUS.

CONTRIBUTIONS MADE BY THE COMPANY TO THE U.S. PROFIT

SHARING PLAN ON BEHALF OF THE EMPLOYEES VEST BASED ON THE

EMPLOYEES YEARS OF SERVICE. VESTING BEGINS AFTER THREE

YEARS OF SERVICE IN 20% ANNUAL INCREMENTS UNTIL THE EMPLOYEE IS

100% VESTED AFTER SEVEN YEARS, OR EARLIER IF THE EMPLOYEE

REACHES AGE 60.

PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS

U.S. PENSION BENEFITS.

THE COMPANY PROVIDES A

TAX-QUALIFIED DEFINED-BENEFIT PENSION PLAN FOR THE BENEFIT OF

ELIGIBLE EMPLOYEES AND RETIREES IN THE U.S. THE PLAN

PROVIDES FOR A MINIMUM PENSION BENEFIT THAT IS DETERMINED BY A

PARTICIPANTS YEARS OF SERVICE AND FINAL AVERAGE

COMPENSATION (TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE PARTICIPANTS SOCIAL

SECURITY WAGE BASE), REDUCED BY THE PARTICIPANTS BALANCE

IN THE PROFIT SHARING PLAN. IF THE PENSION BENEFIT EXCEEDS THE

PARTICIPANTS BALANCE IN THE PROFIT SHARING PLAN, THE

PARTICIPANT WILL RECEIVE A COMBINATION OF PENSION AND PROFIT

SHARING AMOUNTS EQUAL TO THE PENSION BENEFIT. HOWEVER, THE

PARTICIPANT WILL RECEIVE ONLY THE BENEFIT FROM THE PROFIT

SHARING PLAN IF THAT BENEFIT IS GREATER THAN THE VALUE OF THE

PENSION BENEFIT. THE U.S. DEFINED-BENEFIT PLANS

PROJECTED BENEFIT OBLIGATION ASSUMES FUTURE CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE

PROFIT SHARING PLAN, AND IF THE COMPANY DOES NOT CONTINUE TO

CONTRIBUTE TO OR SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCES CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE

PROFIT SHARING PLAN, THE U.S. DEFINED-BENEFIT PLAN

PROJECTED BENEFIT OBLIGATION COULD INCREASE SIGNIFICANTLY.

HISTORICALLY, THE COMPANY HAS CONTRIBUTED 8% TO 12.5% OF

PARTICIPANTS ELIGIBLE COMPENSATION TO THE PROFIT SHARING

PLAN ON AN ANNUAL BASIS. THE BENEFIT OBLIGATION AND RELATED

ASSETS UNDER THIS PLAN HAVE BEEN MEASURED AS OF

NOVEMBER 30, 2005.

IN 2005, THE COMPANY RECEIVED A FAVORABLE DETERMINATION LETTER

FROM THE IRS APPROVING AN AMENDMENT TO THE

U.S. DEFINED-BENEFIT PLAN THAT WAS FILED DURING 2004.

EFFECTIVE FOR THE PLAN YEAR ENDED 2005, THE AMENDMENT ALLOWS FOR

A PORTION OF THE SERPLUS LIABILITY TO BE INCLUDED WITH THE

U.S. DEFINED-BENEFIT PLAN UNDER SECTION 415 OF THE

INTERNAL REVENUE CODE. THE AMENDMENT INCREASED THE PROJECTED

BENEFIT OBLIGATION AND ACCUMULATED BENEFIT OBLIGATION BY

APPROXIMATELY $199 MILLION. THE COMPANY HAS FUNDED THE

U.S. DEFINED-BENEFIT PLAN RELATED TO THIS AMENDMENT IN

ACCORDANCE WITH APPLICABLE FUNDING LAWS IN 2005, AND THIS HAS

BEEN REFLECTED AS EMPLOYER CONTRIBUTIONS IN THE CHANGE IN PLAN

ASSETS TABLE BELOW.

NON-U.S.

PENSION

BENEFITS.

THE COMPANY ALSO PROVIDES DEFINED-BENEFIT PENSION

PLANS IN CERTAIN OTHER COUNTRIES. CONSISTENT WITH THE

REQUIREMENTS OF LOCAL LAW, THE COMPANY DEPOSITS FUNDS FOR

CERTAIN OF THESE PLANS WITH INSURANCE COMPANIES, THIRD-PARTY

TRUSTEES, OR INTO GOVERNMENT-MANAGED ACCOUNTS, AND/OR ACCRUES

FOR THE UNFUNDED PORTION OF THE OBLIGATION. THE ASSUMPTIONS USED

IN CALCULATING THE OBLIGATION FOR THE

NON-U.S.

PLANS

DEPEND ON THE LOCAL ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT. THE BENEFIT

OBLIGATIONS AND RELATED ASSETS UNDER THESE PLANS HAVE BEEN

MEASURED AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2005.

POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL BENEFITS.

UPON RETIREMENT,

ELIGIBLE U.S. EMPLOYEES ARE CREDITED WITH A DEFINED DOLLAR

AMOUNT BASED ON YEARS OF SERVICE. THESE CREDITS CAN BE USED TO

PAY ALL OR A PORTION OF THE COST TO PURCHASE COVERAGE IN AN

INTEL-SPONSORED MEDICAL PLAN. IF THE AVAILABLE CREDITS ARE NOT

SUFFICIENT TO PAY THE ENTIRE COST OF THE COVERAGE, THE REMAINING

COST IS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE RETIREE.

FUNDING POLICY.

THE COMPANYS PRACTICE IS TO FUND

THE VARIOUS PENSION PLANS IN AMOUNTS AT LEAST SUFFICIENT TO MEET

THE MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS OF U.S. FEDERAL LAWS AND

REGULATIONS OR APPLICABLE LOCAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS. THE ASSETS

OF THE VARIOUS PLANS ARE INVESTED IN CORPORATE EQUITIES,

CORPORATE DEBT SECURITIES, GOVERNMENT SECURITIES AND OTHER

INSTITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENTS. THE PORTFOLIO OF EACH PLAN DEPENDS

ON PLAN DESIGN AND APPLICABLE LOCAL LAWS. DEPENDING ON THE

DESIGN OF THE PLAN, LOCAL CUSTOM AND MARKET CIRCUMSTANCES, THE

MINIMUM LIABILITIES OF A PLAN MAY EXCEED QUALIFIED PLAN ASSETS.

THE COMPANY ACCRUES FOR ALL SUCH LIABILITIES.

FOR THE U.S. PLAN, THE DISCOUNT RATE WAS DEVELOPED BY

CALCULATING THE BENEFIT PAYMENT STREAMS BY YEAR TO DETERMINE

WHEN BENEFIT PAYMENTS WILL BE DUE. THE BENEFIT PAYMENT STREAMS

WERE THEN MATCHED BY YEAR TO U.S. TREASURY ZERO COUPON

STRIPS TO MATCH THE TIMING AND AMOUNT OF THE EXPECTED BENEFIT

PAYMENTS. THE COMPANY ADJUSTED THE ZERO COUPON RATE BY A

HISTORICAL CREDIT RISK SPREAD, AND DISCOUNTED IT BACK TO THE

MEASUREMENT DATE TO DETERMINE THE APPROPRIATE DISCOUNT RATE. FOR

THE

NON-U.S.

PLANS,

THE DISCOUNT RATE WAS DEVELOPED BY ANALYZING LONG-TERM BOND

RATES AND MATCHING THE BOND MATURITY WITH THE AVERAGE DURATION

OF THE PENSION LIABILITIES. SEVERAL FACTORS ARE CONSIDERED IN

DEVELOPING THE ASSET RETURN ASSUMPTIONS FOR THE U.S. AND

NON-U.S.

PLANS.

THE COMPANY ANALYZED RATES OF RETURN RELEVANT TO THE COUNTRY

WHERE EACH PLAN IS IN EFFECT AND THE INVESTMENTS APPLICABLE TO

THE PLAN. ADDITIONAL ANALYSIS WAS PERFORMED IN ORDER TO REFLECT

EXPECTATIONS OF FUTURE RETURNS. THE COMPANY ANALYZED LOCAL

ACTUARIAL PROJECTIONS AS WELL AS THE PROJECTED RATES OF RETURN

FROM INVESTMENT MANAGERS. THE EXPECTED LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN

SHOWN FOR THE

NON-U.S.

NOTE 13: ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES

BUSINESS COMBINATIONS

ALL OF THE COMPANYS ACQUISITIONS THAT QUALIFIED AS

BUSINESS COMBINATIONS HAVE BEEN ACCOUNTED FOR USING THE PURCHASE

METHOD OF ACCOUNTING. CONSIDERATION INCLUDES THE CASH PAID AND

THE VALUE OF ANY OPTIONS ASSUMED, LESS ANY CASH ACQUIRED, AND

EXCLUDES CONTINGENT EMPLOYEE COMPENSATION PAYABLE IN CASH AND

ANY DEBT ASSUMED. THE COMPANY ACCOUNTS FOR THE INTRINSIC VALUE

OF STOCK OPTIONS ASSUMED RELATED TO FUTURE SERVICES AS UNEARNED

COMPENSATION WITHIN STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY.

DURING 2005, THE COMPANY COMPLETED THREE ACQUISITIONS QUALIFYING

AS BUSINESS COMBINATIONS IN EXCHANGE FOR AGGREGATE NET CASH

CONSIDERATION OF $177 MILLION, PLUS CERTAIN LIABILITIES.

MOST OF THIS CONSIDERATION WAS ALLOCATED TO GOODWILL AND RELATED

TO BUSINESSES WITHIN THE ALL OTHER CATEGORY FOR

SEGMENT REPORTING PURPOSES. DURING 2004, THE COMPANY COMPLETED

ONE ACQUISITION QUALIFYING AS A BUSINESS COMBINATION IN EXCHANGE

FOR NET CASH CONSIDERATION OF APPROXIMATELY $33 MILLION,

PLUS CERTAIN LIABILITIES. THE COMPANY ALSO COMPLETED ONE

ACQUISITION IN 2003 QUALIFYING AS A BUSINESS COMBINATION IN

EXCHANGE FOR NET CASH CONSIDERATION OF $21 MILLION, PLUS

CERTAIN LIABILITIES. THE OPERATING RESULTS SINCE THE DATE OF

ACQUISITION OF THE BUSINESSES ACQUIRED ARE INCLUDED IN THE

SEGMENT THAT COMPLETED THE ACQUISITION.

DEVELOPMENT-STAGE OPERATIONS

AN ACQUISITION OF A DEVELOPMENT-STAGE OPERATION DOES NOT QUALIFY

AS A BUSINESS COMBINATION UNDER SFAS NO. 141,

BUSINESS COMBINATIONS, AND PURCHASE CONSIDERATION

FOR SUCH AN ACQUISITION IS NOT ALLOCATED TO GOODWILL.

WORKFORCE-IN

-PLACE

QUALIFIES AS AN IDENTIFIED INTANGIBLE ASSET FOR AN ACQUISITION

OF A DEVELOPMENT-STAGE OPERATION.

DURING 2005, THE COMPANY ACQUIRED A DEVELOPMENT-STAGE OPERATION

IN EXCHANGE FOR TOTAL NET CASH CONSIDERATION OF

$19 MILLION, WHICH RESULTED IN THE RECORDING OF

WORKFORCE-IN

-PLACE OF

$20 MILLION. DURING 2004, THERE WERE NO ACQUISITIONS

QUALIFYING AS DEVELOPMENT-STAGE OPERATIONS. DURING 2003, THE

COMPANY ACQUIRED A DEVELOPMENT-STAGE OPERATION IN EXCHANGE FOR

TOTAL NET CASH CONSIDERATION OF APPROXIMATELY $40 MILLION,

ALL OF WHICH WAS ALLOCATED TO

WORKFORCE-IN

-PLACE. THE

OPERATING RESULTS OF THESE ACQUISITIONS ARE INCLUDED IN THE

SEGMENT COMPLETING THE ACQUISITION, AS APPROPRIATE, FOR SEGMENT

REPORTING PURPOSES.

DIVESTITURES

DURING 2003, THE COMPANY RECOGNIZED APPROXIMATELY

$758 MILLION IN TAX BENEFITS RELATED TO SALES OF THE STOCK

OF CERTAIN PREVIOUSLY ACQUIRED COMPANIES, PRIMARILY DSP

COMMUNICATIONS, INC. (DSP), DIALOGIC CORPORATION AND XIRCOM,

INC. A NET BENEFIT OF APPROXIMATELY $420 MILLION WAS

RECOGNIZED ON THE DIVESTITURE OF A PORTION OF THE INTELLECTUAL

PROPERTY ASSETS OF DSP, THROUGH THE SALE OF THE STOCK OF DSP. A

BENEFIT OF APPROXIMATELY $200 MILLION WAS RECOGNIZED ON THE

DIVESTITURE OF A PORTION OF THE ASSETS, PRIMARILY REAL ESTATE,

OF DIALOGIC, THROUGH THE SALE OF THE STOCK OF DIALOGIC, AND A

BENEFIT OF APPROXIMATELY $125 MILLION WAS RECOGNIZED

RELATED TO THE SALE OF A WIRELESS WAN BUSINESS, THROUGH THE SALE

OF THE STOCK OF XIRCOM. THE PRE-TAX GAINS AND LOSSES ON THESE

SALES FOR FINANCIAL STATEMENT OR BOOK PURPOSES WERE NOT

SIGNIFICANT. THE COMPANY WAS ABLE TO RECOGNIZE TAX LOSSES

BECAUSE THE TAX BASIS IN THE ENTITIES EXCEEDED THE BOOK BASIS,

AS THE GOODWILL ALLOCATED TO THE TRANSACTIONS FOR FINANCIAL

STATEMENT PURPOSES WAS LESS THAN THE AMOUNT THE COMPANY COULD

EFFECTIVELY DEDUCT FOR TAX PURPOSES.

NOTE 14: GOODWILL

DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2005, THE COMPANY REORGANIZED ITS

BUSINESS GROUPS TO BRING ALL MAJOR PRODUCT GROUPS IN LINE WITH

THE COMPANYS STRATEGY TO DESIGN AND DELIVER TECHNOLOGY

PLATFORMS (SEE NOTE 19: OPERATING SEGMENT AND

GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION). DUE TO THIS REORGANIZATION OF THE

COMPANYS BUSINESS GROUPS DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2005,

GOODWILL WAS ALLOCATED TO THE NEW REPORTING UNITS BASED ON THE

ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF EACH BUSINESS GROUP WITHIN ITS ORIGINAL

REPORTING UNIT RELATIVE TO THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF THAT

REPORTING UNIT. IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2005, THE COMPANY ADDED

THE FLASH MEMORY GROUP (FMG). AS THE FLASH PRODUCTS GROUP WAS A

SEPARATE REPORTING UNIT IN MG, WITH NO GOODWILL ASSIGNED, THE

TRANSFER OF THE FLASH PRODUCTS GROUP TO FMG DID NOT CHANGE THE

GOODWILL RECORDED WITHIN THE OPERATING SEGMENTS. THE MAJORITY OF

THE ALL OTHER CATEGORY GOODWILL IS INCLUDED IN THE

DIGITAL HOME GROUP OPERATING SEGMENT, WHICH IS ALSO A REPORTING

UNIT.

DURING 2005, THE COMPANY COMPLETED THREE ACQUISITIONS FOR TOTAL

PURCHASE CONSIDERATION, NET OF CASH ACQUIRED, OF

$177 MILLION, PLUS LIABILITIES ASSUMED, WHICH RESULTED IN

GOODWILL OF $165 MILLION. THE OPERATING RESULTS OF THE

ACQUIRED COMPANIES HAVE BEEN REPORTED IN THE ALL

OTHER CATEGORY FROM THE DATE OF ACQUISITION.

DURING 2005 AND 2004, THE COMPANY COMPLETED ITS ANNUAL REVIEWS

AND CONCLUDED THAT GOODWILL WAS NOT IMPAIRED IN EITHER YEAR.

DURING 2003, UNDER THE FORMER REPORTING UNIT STRUCTURE, THE

COMPANY FOUND INDICATORS OF IMPAIRMENT OF GOODWILL AND RECORDED

A NON-CASH IMPAIRMENT CHARGE OF $611 MILLION, WHICH WAS

INCLUDED AS A COMPONENT OF OPERATING INCOME IN THE ALL

OTHER CATEGORY FOR SEGMENT REPORTING PURPOSES. UNDER THE

FORMER REPORTING STRUCTURE, THE WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS BUSINESS

UNIT HAD NOT PERFORMED AS MANAGEMENT HAD EXPECTED. IT BECAME

APPARENT THAT THE BUSINESS WAS EXPECTED TO GROW MORE SLOWLY THAN

HAD PREVIOUSLY BEEN PROJECTED. A SLOWER-THAN-EXPECTED ROLLOUT OF

PRODUCTS AND SLOWER-THAN-EXPECTED CUSTOMER ACCEPTANCE OF THE

REPORTING UNITS PRODUCTS IN THE CELLULAR BASEBAND

PROCESSOR BUSINESS, AS WELL AS A DELAY IN THE TRANSITION TO

NEXT-GENERATION PHONE NETWORKS, HAD PUSHED OUT THE FORECASTS FOR

SALES INTO HIGH-END DATA CELL PHONES. THESE FACTORS RESULTED IN

LOWER GROWTH EXPECTATIONS FOR THE REPORTING UNIT AND TRIGGERED

THE GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT. ALSO DURING 2003, THE GOODWILL RELATED

TO ONE OF THE COMPANYS SMALL SEED BUSINESSES, INCLUDED IN

THE ALL OTHER CATEGORY, WAS IMPAIRED.

INTERGRAPH A TOTAL OF $225 MILLION, AND INTERGRAPH AGREED

TO DISMISS CERTAIN PENDING LITIGATION, GRANTED LICENSE RIGHTS IN

FAVOR OF INTEL AND INTELS CUSTOMERS, AND COVENANTED NOT TO

SUE ANY INTEL CUSTOMER FOR PRODUCTS THAT INCLUDE AN INTEL

MICROPROCESSOR, INTEL CHIPSET AND INTEL MOTHERBOARD. AS A RESULT

OF THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT, INTEL RECORDED A $162 MILLION

INTEL CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

IMFT IS A VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITY AS DEFINED BY FASB

INTERPRETATION NO. 46(R), CONSOLIDATION OF VARIABLE

INTEREST ENTITIES (FIN 46), BECAUSE ALL POSITIVE AND

NEGATIVE VARIANCES IN IMFTS COST STRUCTURE ARE PASSED ON

TO INTEL AND MICRON THROUGH THEIR PURCHASE AGREEMENT WITH IMFT.

MICRON AND INTEL ARE CONSIDERED RELATED PARTIES UNDER THE

PROVISIONS OF FIN 46, AND INTEL HAS DETERMINED THAT INTEL

IS NOT THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY OF IMFT. ACCORDINGLY, INTEL WILL

ACCOUNT FOR ITS INTEREST IN IMFT USING THE EQUITY METHOD OF

ACCOUNTING. INTELS MAXIMUM EXPOSURE TO LOSS AS A RESULT OF

ITS INVOLVEMENT WITH IMFT IS $1.2 BILLION AS OF JANUARY

2006, WHICH REPRESENTS INTELS INITIAL INVESTMENT.

INTELS INVESTMENT IN IMFT WILL BE CLASSIFIED IN OTHER

ASSETS ON THE BALANCE SHEET.

CONCURRENT WITH THE FORMATION OF IMFT, INTEL PAID MICRON

$270 MILLION FOR PRODUCT DESIGNS DEVELOPED BY MICRON AS

WELL AS CERTAIN OTHER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY. INTEL OWNS THE

RIGHTS WITH RESPECT TO ALL PRODUCT DESIGNS AND WILL LICENSE THE

DESIGNS TO MICRON. MICRON PAID INTEL $40 MILLION TO LICENSE

THESE INITIAL PRODUCT DESIGNS AND WILL PAY ADDITIONAL ROYALTIES

ON NEW PRODUCT DESIGNS. INTEL HAS REFLECTED ITS NET INVESTMENT

IN THIS TECHNOLOGY OF $230 MILLION AS AN IDENTIFIED

INTANGIBLE ASSET. THE IDENTIFIED INTANGIBLE ASSET WILL BE

AMORTIZED INTO COST OF SALES OVER ITS EXPECTED FIVE-YEAR LIFE.

COSTS INCURRED BY INTEL AND MICRON FOR PRODUCT AND PROCESS

DEVELOPMENT RELATED TO IMFT ARE GENERALLY SPLIT EVENLY BETWEEN

INTEL AND MICRON AND WILL BE CLASSIFIED AS RESEARCH AND

DEVELOPMENT.

ADDITIONALLY, INTEL HAS ENTERED INTO A LONG-TERM SUPPLY

AGREEMENT WITH APPLE COMPUTER, INC. TO SUPPLY A SIGNIFICANT

PORTION OF THE NAND FLASH MEMORY OUTPUT THAT INTEL WILL PURCHASE

FROM IMFT THROUGH DECEMBER 31, 2010. IN JANUARY 2006, APPLE

PRE-PAID $250 MILLION TO INTEL THAT WILL BE APPLIED TO

PURCHASES OF NAND FLASH MEMORY BY APPLE BEGINNING IN 2008.

NOTE 17: COMMITMENTS

THE COMPANY LEASES A PORTION OF ITS CAPITAL EQUIPMENT AND

CERTAIN OF ITS FACILITIES UNDER OPERATING LEASES THAT EXPIRE AT

VARIOUS DATES THROUGH 2021. ADDITIONALLY, THE COMPANY LEASES

PORTIONS OF ITS LAND THAT EXPIRE AT VARIOUS DATES THROUGH 2059.

RENTAL EXPENSE WAS $150 MILLION IN 2005 ($136 MILLION

IN 2004 AND $149 MILLION IN 2003). MINIMUM RENTAL

COMMITMENTS UNDER ALL NON-CANCELABLE LEASES WITH AN INITIAL TERM

IN EXCESS OF ONE YEAR ARE PAYABLE AS FOLLOWS.

FLAT AT $2.7 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2005 COMPARED TO

$2.8 BILLION AT DECEMBER 25, 2004. THESE CAPITAL

PURCHASE OBLIGATIONS RELATE PRIMARILY TO CAPITAL EQUIPMENT FOR

MANUFACTURING PROCESS TECHNOLOGY. OTHER COMMITMENTS AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2005 TOTALED $448 MILLION. OTHER

COMMITMENTS INCLUDE PAYMENTS DUE UNDER VARIOUS TYPES OF LICENSES

AND NON-CONTINGENT FUNDING OBLIGATIONS. FUNDING OBLIGATIONS

INCLUDE, FOR EXAMPLE, AGREEMENTS TO FUND VARIOUS PROJECTS WITH

OTHER COMPANIES. IN ADDITION, IN JANUARY 2006, THE COMPANY

ENTERED INTO VARIOUS CONTRACTUAL COMMITMENTS RELATED TO THE IMFT

VENTURE WITH MICRON (SEE NOTE 16: VENTURE).

NOTE 18: CONTINGENCIES

TAX MATTERS

IN CONNECTION WITH THE IRSS REGULAR EXAMINATION OF

INTELS TAX RETURNS FOR THE YEARS 1999 AND 2000, THE IRS

FORMALLY ASSESSED IN EARLY 2005 CERTAIN ADJUSTMENTS TO THE

AMOUNTS REFLECTED BY INTEL ON THOSE RETURNS AS A TAX BENEFIT FOR

ITS EXPORT SALES. ALSO IN 2005, THE IRS FORMALLY ASSESSED

SIMILAR ADJUSTMENTS TO THE AMOUNTS REFLECTED BY INTEL FOR THE

YEARS 2001 AND 2002 AS A TAX BENEFIT FOR EXPORT SALES. THE

COMPANY DOES NOT AGREE WITH THESE ADJUSTMENTS AND HAS APPEALED

THE ASSESSMENTS. IF THE IRS PREVAILS IN ITS POSITION,

INTELS FEDERAL INCOME TAX DUE FOR 1999 THROUGH 2002 WOULD

INCREASE BY APPROXIMATELY $1.0 BILLION, PLUS INTEREST. THE

IRS MAY MAKE SIMILAR CLAIMS FOR YEARS SUBSEQUENT TO 2002 IN

FUTURE AUDITS, AND IF THE IRS PREVAILS, INCOME TAX DUE FOR 2003

THROUGH 2005 WOULD INCREASE BY APPROXIMATELY $1.2 BILLION,

PLUS INTEREST.

ALTHOUGH THE FINAL RESOLUTION OF THE ADJUSTMENTS IS UNCERTAIN,

BASED ON CURRENTLY AVAILABLE INFORMATION, MANAGEMENT BELIEVES

THAT THE ULTIMATE OUTCOME WILL NOT HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE

EFFECT ON THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL POSITION, CASH FLOWS OR

OVERALL TRENDS IN RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. THERE IS THE

POSSIBILITY OF A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON THE RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS OF THE PERIOD IN WHICH THE MATTER IS ULTIMATELY

RESOLVED, IF IT IS RESOLVED UNFAVORABLY, OR IN THE PERIOD IN

WHICH AN UNFAVORABLE OUTCOME BECOMES PROBABLE AND REASONABLY

ESTIMABLE.

REGARDING CLAIMS BY AMD THAT INTEL USED UNFAIR BUSINESS

PRACTICES TO PERSUADE CLIENTS TO BUY INTEL MICROPROCESSORS. IN

JUNE 2005, INTEL RECEIVED AN INQUIRY FROM THE KOREA FAIR TRADE

COMMISSION REQUESTING DOCUMENTS FROM INTELS KOREAN

SUBSIDIARY RELATED TO MARKETING AND REBATE PROGRAMS THAT INTEL

ENTERED INTO WITH KOREAN PC MANUFACTURERS. INTEL IS COOPERATING

WITH THESE AGENCIES IN THEIR INVESTIGATIONS AND EXPECTS THAT

THESE MATTERS WILL BE ACCEPTABLY RESOLVED.

IN MARCH 2004, MICROUNITY, INC. FILED SUIT AGAINST INTEL AND

DELL INC. IN THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF TEXAS. MICROUNITY CLAIMED

THAT

INTEL

®

PENTIUM

®

III

,

PENTIUM

®

PENTIUM

®

AND

ITANIUM

®

2

PROCESSORS INFRINGED SEVEN MICROUNITY PATENTS, AND THAT CERTAIN

INTEL CHIPSETS INFRINGED ONE MICROUNITY PATENT. MICROUNITY

SOUGHT AN INJUNCTION, UNSPECIFIED DAMAGES AND ATTORNEYS

FEES AGAINST BOTH INTEL AND DELL. IN OCTOBER 2005, MICROUNITY

AND INTEL ENTERED INTO A LICENSE AGREEMENT WHEREBY INTEL AGREED

TO PAY MICROUNITY $300 MILLION FOR A

PAID-UP

LICENSE TO ALL

MICROUNITY PATENTS AND FOR CERTAIN OTHER RIGHTS INCLUDING RIGHTS

ON BEHALF OF INTEL CUSTOMERS. UNDER THE AGREEMENT, MICROUNITY

DISMISSED ALL CLAIMS IN THE LAWSUIT AGAINST INTEL AND DELL WITH

PREJUDICE.

IN JUNE 2002, VARIOUS PLAINTIFFS FILED A LAWSUIT IN THE THIRD

JUDICIAL CIRCUIT COURT, MADISON COUNTY, ILLINOIS, AGAINST INTEL,

GATEWAY INC., HEWLETT-PACKARD COMPANY AND HPDIRECT, INC.,

ALLEGING THAT THE DEFENDANTS ADVERTISEMENTS AND STATEMENTS

MISLED THE PUBLIC BY SUPPRESSING AND CONCEALING THE ALLEGED

MATERIAL FACT THAT SYSTEMS CONTAINING INTEL PENTIUM 4 PROCESSORS

ARE LESS POWERFUL AND SLOWER THAN SYSTEMS CONTAINING INTEL

PENTIUM

III

PROCESSORS

AND A COMPETITORS MICROPROCESSORS. IN JULY 2004, THE COURT

CERTIFIED AGAINST INTEL AN ILLINOIS-ONLY CLASS OF CERTAIN

END-USE PURCHASERS OF CERTAIN PENTIUM 4 PROCESSORS OR COMPUTERS

CONTAINING SUCH MICROPROCESSORS. THE COURT DENIED

PLAINTIFFS MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION OF THIS RULING. IN

JANUARY 2005, THE COURT GRANTED A MOTION FILED JOINTLY BY THE

PLAINTIFFS AND INTEL THAT STAYED THE PROCEEDINGS IN THE TRIAL

COURT PENDING APPELLATE REVIEW OF THE COURTS CLASS

CERTIFICATION ORDER. THE PLAINTIFFS SEEK UNSPECIFIED DAMAGES AND

ATTORNEYS FEES AND COSTS. INTEL DISPUTES THE

PLAINTIFFS CLAIMS AND INTENDS TO DEFEND THE LAWSUIT

VIGOROUSLY.

THE COMPANY IS CURRENTLY A PARTY TO VARIOUS CLAIMS AND LEGAL

PROCEEDINGS, INCLUDING THOSE NOTED ABOVE. IF MANAGEMENT BELIEVES

THAT A LOSS ARISING FROM THESE MATTERS IS PROBABLE AND CAN

REASONABLY BE ESTIMATED, THE COMPANY RECORDS THE AMOUNT OF THE

LOSS, OR THE MINIMUM ESTIMATED LIABILITY WHEN THE LOSS IS

ESTIMATED USING A RANGE, AND NO POINT WITHIN THE RANGE IS MORE

PROBABLE THAN ANOTHER. AS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION BECOMES

AVAILABLE, ANY POTENTIAL LIABILITY RELATED TO THESE MATTERS IS

ASSESSED AND THE ESTIMATES ARE REVISED, IF NECESSARY. BASED ON

CURRENTLY AVAILABLE INFORMATION, MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT THE

ULTIMATE OUTCOME OF THESE MATTERS, INDIVIDUALLY AND IN THE

AGGREGATE, WILL NOT HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE

COMPANYS FINANCIAL POSITION, CASH FLOWS OR OVERALL TRENDS

IN RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. HOWEVER, LITIGATION IS SUBJECT TO

INHERENT UNCERTAINTIES, AND UNFAVORABLE RULINGS COULD OCCUR. AN

UNFAVORABLE RULING COULD INCLUDE MONETARY DAMAGES OR, IN CASES

WHERE INJUNCTIVE RELIEF IS SOUGHT, AN INJUNCTION PROHIBITING

INTEL FROM SELLING ONE OR MORE PRODUCTS. IF AN UNFAVORABLE

RULING WERE TO OCCUR, THERE EXISTS THE POSSIBILITY OF A MATERIAL

ADVERSE IMPACT ON THE BUSINESS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE

PERIOD IN WHICH THE RULING OCCURS, OR FUTURE PERIODS.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

NOTE 19: OPERATING SEGMENT AND GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION

DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2005, THE COMPANY REORGANIZED ITS

OPERATING SEGMENTS TO BRING ALL MAJOR PRODUCT GROUPS IN LINE

WITH THE COMPANYS STRATEGY TO DESIGN AND DELIVER

TECHNOLOGY PLATFORMS. THE OPERATING SEGMENTS AFTER THE

FIRST-QUARTER

REORGANIZATION INCLUDED THE DIGITAL ENTERPRISE GROUP, THE

MOBILITY GROUP, THE DIGITAL HOME GROUP, THE DIGITAL HEALTH GROUP

AND THE CHANNEL PLATFORMS GROUP. IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2005,

THE COMPANY ADDED THE FLASH MEMORY GROUP. THE DIGITAL ENTERPRISE

GROUP AND THE MOBILITY GROUP ARE REPORTABLE OPERATING SEGMENTS.

THE FLASH MEMORY GROUP, DIGITAL HOME GROUP, DIGITAL HEALTH GROUP

AND CHANNEL PLATFORMS GROUP OPERATING SEGMENTS DO NOT MEET THE

QUANTITATIVE THRESHOLDS FOR REPORTABLE SEGMENTS AS DEFINED BY

SFAS NO. 131, DISCLOSURES ABOUT SEGMENTS OF AN

ENTERPRISE AND RELATED INFORMATION. HOWEVER, THE FLASH

MEMORY GROUP IS REPORTED SEPARATELY, AS MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT

THIS INFORMATION IS USEFUL TO THE READER. THE DIGITAL HOME

GROUP, DIGITAL HEALTH GROUP AND CHANNEL PLATFORMS GROUP

OPERATING SEGMENTS ARE INCLUDED WITHIN THE ALL OTHER

CATEGORY. ALL

PRIOR-PERIOD

AMOUNTS

HAVE BEEN ADJUSTED RETROSPECTIVELY TO REFLECT THE NEW

ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE AND CERTAIN MINOR REORGANIZATIONS

EFFECTED THROUGH THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2005.

THE CHIEF OPERATING DECISION MAKER (CODM), AS DEFINED BY

SFAS NO. 131, IS THE COMPANYS PRESIDENT AND

CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER (CEO), PAUL S. OTELLINI. THE CODM

ALLOCATES RESOURCES TO AND ASSESSES THE PERFORMANCE OF EACH

OPERATING SEGMENT USING INFORMATION ABOUT ITS REVENUE AND

OPERATING INCOME (LOSS) BEFORE INTEREST AND TAXES.

THE DIGITAL ENTERPRISE GROUP OPERATING SEGMENTS PRODUCTS

INCLUDE MICROPROCESSORS AND RELATED CHIPSETS AND MOTHERBOARDS

DESIGNED FOR THE DESKTOP (INCLUDING CONSUMER DESKTOP) AND

ENTERPRISE COMPUTING MARKET SEGMENTS, COMMUNICATIONS

INFRASTRUCTURE COMPONENTS SUCH AS NETWORK PROCESSORS AND

EMBEDDED MICROPROCESSORS, WIRED CONNECTIVITY DEVICES, AND

PRODUCTS FOR NETWORK AND SERVER STORAGE. THE MOBILITY GROUP

OPERATING SEGMENTS PRODUCTS INCLUDE MICROPROCESSORS AND

RELATED CHIPSETS DESIGNED FOR THE NOTEBOOK COMPUTING MARKET

SEGMENT, WIRELESS CONNECTIVITY PRODUCTS, AND APPLICATION AND

CELLULAR BASEBAND PROCESSORS USED IN CELLULAR HANDSETS AND

HANDHELD COMPUTING DEVICES. THE FLASH MEMORY GROUP OPERATING

SEGMENTS PRODUCTS INCLUDE NOR FLASH MEMORY PRODUCTS

DESIGNED FOR CELLULAR PHONES AND EMBEDDED FORM FACTORS SUCH AS

SET-TOP BOXES, NETWORKING PRODUCTS, AND OTHER DEVICES INCLUDING

DVD PLAYERS AND DSL AND CABLE MODEMS. BEGINNING IN 2006, THE

FLASH MEMORY GROUPS PRODUCTS WILL ALSO INCLUDE NAND FLASH

MEMORY PRODUCTS MANUFACTURED BY IMFT. REVENUE FOR THE ALL

OTHER CATEGORY PRIMARILY CONSISTS OF MICROPROCESSORS AND

RELATED CHIPSETS SOLD BY THE DIGITAL HOME GROUP.

IN ADDITION TO THESE OPERATING SEGMENTS, THE COMPANY HAS SALES

AND MARKETING, MANUFACTURING, FINANCE AND ADMINISTRATION GROUPS.

EXPENSES OF THESE GROUPS ARE GENERALLY ALLOCATED TO THE

OPERATING SEGMENTS AND ARE INCLUDED IN THE OPERATING RESULTS

REPORTED BELOW. IN ADDITION TO THE OPERATING RESULTS FOR THE

DIGITAL HOME GROUP, DIGITAL HEALTH GROUP AND CHANNEL PLATFORMS

GROUP OPERATING SEGMENTS, THE ALL OTHER CATEGORY

INCLUDES CERTAIN CORPORATE-LEVEL OPERATING EXPENSES, INCLUDING A

PORTION OF PROFIT-DEPENDENT BONUS AND OTHER EXPENSES NOT

ALLOCATED TO THE OPERATING SEGMENTS. ALL OTHER ALSO

INCLUDES THE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OF SEED BUSINESSES THAT

SUPPORT THE COMPANYS INITIATIVES. FINALLY, ALL

OTHER INCLUDES ACQUISITION-RELATED COSTS, INCLUDING

AMORTIZATION AND ANY IMPAIRMENTS OF ACQUISITION-RELATED

INTANGIBLES AND GOODWILL, AND CHARGES FOR PURCHASED IN-PROCESS

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT. IN 2003, ACQUISITION-RELATED COSTS

INCLUDED A GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT CHARGE OF $611 MILLION FOR

THE REMAINING GOODWILL BALANCE RELATED TO THE FORMER WIRELESS

COMMUNICATIONS AND COMPUTING GROUP OPERATING SEGMENT.

THE COMPANY DOES NOT IDENTIFY OR ALLOCATE ASSETS BY OPERATING

SEGMENT, NOR DOES THE CODM EVALUATE OPERATING SEGMENTS USING

DISCRETE ASSET INFORMATION. OPERATING SEGMENTS DO NOT RECORD

INTERSEGMENT REVENUE, AND, ACCORDINGLY, THERE IS NONE TO BE

REPORTED. THE COMPANY DOES NOT ALLOCATE INTEREST AND OTHER

INCOME, INTEREST EXPENSE OR TAXES TO OPERATING SEGMENTS.

ALTHOUGH THE CODM USES OPERATING INCOME TO EVALUATE THE

SEGMENTS, OPERATING COSTS INCLUDED IN ONE SEGMENT MAY BENEFIT

OTHER SEGMENTS. EXCEPT AS DISCUSSED ABOVE, THE ACCOUNTING

POLICIES FOR SEGMENT REPORTING ARE THE SAME AS FOR THE COMPANY

AS A WHOLE.

THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND STOCKHOLDERS, INTEL

CORPORATION

WE HAVE AUDITED THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS OF

INTEL CORPORATION AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2005 AND

DECEMBER 25, 2004, AND THE RELATED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS

OF INCOME, STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY, AND CASH FLOWS FOR EACH OF

THE THREE YEARS IN THE PERIOD ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2005. OUR

AUDITS ALSO INCLUDED THE FINANCIAL STATEMENT SCHEDULE LISTED IN

THE INDEX AT PART IV, ITEM 15. THESE FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS AND SCHEDULE ARE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE

COMPANYS MANAGEMENT. OUR RESPONSIBILITY IS TO EXPRESS AN

OPINION ON THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SCHEDULE BASED ON OUR

AUDITS.

WE CONDUCTED OUR AUDITS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE STANDARDS OF THE

PUBLIC COMPANY ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BOARD (UNITED STATES). THOSE

STANDARDS REQUIRE THAT WE PLAN AND PERFORM THE AUDIT TO OBTAIN

REASONABLE ASSURANCE ABOUT WHETHER THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE

FREE OF MATERIAL MISSTATEMENT. AN AUDIT INCLUDES EXAMINING, ON A

TEST BASIS, EVIDENCE SUPPORTING THE AMOUNTS AND DISCLOSURES IN

THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. AN AUDIT ALSO INCLUDES ASSESSING THE

ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES USED AND SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES MADE BY

MANAGEMENT, AS WELL AS EVALUATING THE OVERALL FINANCIAL

STATEMENT PRESENTATION. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR AUDITS PROVIDE A

REASONABLE BASIS FOR OUR OPINION.

IN OUR OPINION, THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS REFERRED TO ABOVE

PRESENT FAIRLY, IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS, THE CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL POSITION OF INTEL CORPORATION AT DECEMBER 31,

2005 AND DECEMBER 25, 2004, AND THE CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF

ITS OPERATIONS AND ITS CASH FLOWS FOR EACH OF THE THREE YEARS IN

THE PERIOD ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2005, IN CONFORMITY WITH U.S.

GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES. ALSO, IN OUR OPINION,

THE RELATED FINANCIAL STATEMENT SCHEDULE, WHEN CONSIDERED IN

REPORT OF ERNST & YOUNG LLP, INDEPENDENT REGISTERED

PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND STOCKHOLDERS, INTEL

CORPORATION

WE HAVE AUDITED MANAGEMENTS ASSESSMENT, INCLUDED IN THE

ACCOMPANYING MANAGEMENT REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER

FINANCIAL REPORTING, THAT INTEL CORPORATION MAINTAINED EFFECTIVE

INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2005, BASED ON CRITERIA ESTABLISHED IN

INTERNAL CONTROLINTEGRATED FRAMEWORK ISSUED BY THE

COMMITTEE OF SPONSORING ORGANIZATIONS OF THE TREADWAY COMMISSION

(THE COSO CRITERIA). INTEL CORPORATIONS MANAGEMENT IS

RESPONSIBLE FOR MAINTAINING EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER

FINANCIAL REPORTING AND FOR ITS ASSESSMENT OF THE EFFECTIVENESS

OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING. OUR RESPONSIBILITY

IS TO EXPRESS AN OPINION ON MANAGEMENTS ASSESSMENT AND AN

OPINION ON THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE COMPANYS INTERNAL

CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING BASED ON OUR AUDIT.

WE CONDUCTED OUR AUDIT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE STANDARDS OF THE

PUBLIC COMPANY ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BOARD (UNITED STATES). THOSE

STANDARDS REQUIRE THAT WE PLAN AND PERFORM THE AUDIT TO OBTAIN

REASONABLE ASSURANCE ABOUT WHETHER EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL

OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING WAS MAINTAINED IN ALL MATERIAL

RESPECTS. OUR AUDIT INCLUDED OBTAINING AN UNDERSTANDING OF

INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, EVALUATING

MANAGEMENTS ASSESSMENT, TESTING AND EVALUATING THE DESIGN

AND OPERATING EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL CONTROL, AND PERFORMING

SUCH OTHER PROCEDURES AS WE CONSIDERED NECESSARY IN THE

CIRCUMSTANCES. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR AUDIT PROVIDES A REASONABLE

BASIS FOR OUR OPINION.

A COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING IS A

PROCESS DESIGNED TO PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING THE

RELIABILITY OF FINANCIAL REPORTING AND THE PREPARATION OF

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR EXTERNAL PURPOSES IN ACCORDANCE WITH

GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES. A COMPANYS

INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING INCLUDES THOSE

POLICIES AND PROCEDURES THAT (1) PERTAIN TO THE MAINTENANCE

OF RECORDS THAT, IN REASONABLE DETAIL, ACCURATELY AND FAIRLY

REFLECT THE TRANSACTIONS AND DISPOSITIONS OF THE ASSETS OF THE

COMPANY; (2) PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE THAT TRANSACTIONS

ARE RECORDED AS NECESSARY TO PERMIT PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING

PRINCIPLES, AND THAT RECEIPTS AND EXPENDITURES OF THE COMPANY

ARE BEING MADE ONLY IN ACCORDANCE WITH AUTHORIZATIONS OF

MANAGEMENT AND DIRECTORS OF THE COMPANY; AND (3) PROVIDE

REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING PREVENTION OR TIMELY DETECTION OF

UNAUTHORIZED ACQUISITION, USE, OR DISPOSITION OF THE

COMPANYS ASSETS THAT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

BECAUSE OF ITS INHERENT LIMITATIONS, INTERNAL CONTROL OVER

FINANCIAL REPORTING MAY NOT PREVENT OR DETECT MISSTATEMENTS.

ALSO, PROJECTIONS OF ANY EVALUATION OF EFFECTIVENESS TO FUTURE

PERIODS ARE SUBJECT TO THE RISK THAT CONTROLS MAY BECOME

INADEQUATE BECAUSE OF CHANGES IN CONDITIONS, OR THAT THE DEGREE

OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE POLICIES OR PROCEDURES MAY DETERIORATE.

IN OUR OPINION, MANAGEMENTS ASSESSMENT THAT INTEL

CORPORATION MAINTAINED EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL

REPORTING AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2005, IS FAIRLY STATED, IN ALL

MATERIAL RESPECTS, BASED ON THE COSO CRITERIA. ALSO, IN OUR

OPINION, INTEL CORPORATION MAINTAINED, IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS,

EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2005, BASED ON THE COSO CRITERIA.

WE ALSO HAVE AUDITED, IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE STANDARDS OF THE

PUBLIC COMPANY ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BOARD (UNITED STATES), THE

2005 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF INTEL CORPORATION AND

OUR REPORT DATED FEBRUARY 21, 2006 EXPRESSED AN UNQUALIFIED

OPINION THEREON.

EVALUATION OF DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

WE CONDUCTED AN EVALUATION OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE DESIGN

AND OPERATION OF OUR DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND

PROCEDURES (DISCLOSURE CONTROLS) AS OF THE END OF THE

PERIOD COVERED BY THIS

FORM

10-K.

THE

CONTROLS EVALUATION WAS CONDUCTED UNDER THE SUPERVISION AND WITH

THE PARTICIPATION OF MANAGEMENT, INCLUDING OUR CEO AND CFO.

DISCLOSURE CONTROLS ARE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES DESIGNED TO

REASONABLY ASSURE THAT INFORMATION REQUIRED TO BE DISCLOSED IN

OUR REPORTS FILED UNDER THE EXCHANGE ACT, SUCH AS THIS

FORM

10-K,

IS

RECORDED, PROCESSED, SUMMARIZED AND REPORTED WITHIN THE TIME

PERIODS SPECIFIED IN THE SECS RULES AND FORMS. DISCLOSURE

CONTROLS ARE ALSO DESIGNED TO REASONABLY ASSURE THAT SUCH

INFORMATION IS ACCUMULATED AND COMMUNICATED TO OUR MANAGEMENT,

INCLUDING THE CEO AND CFO, AS APPROPRIATE TO ALLOW TIMELY

DECISIONS REGARDING REQUIRED DISCLOSURE. OUR QUARTERLY

EVALUATION OF DISCLOSURE CONTROLS INCLUDES AN EVALUATION OF SOME

COMPONENTS OF OUR INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, AND

INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING IS ALSO SEPARATELY

EVALUATED ON AN ANNUAL BASIS FOR PURPOSES OF PROVIDING THE

MANAGEMENT REPORT WHICH IS SET FORTH BELOW.

THE EVALUATION OF OUR DISCLOSURE CONTROLS INCLUDED A REVIEW OF

THE CONTROLS OBJECTIVES AND DESIGN, THE COMPANYS

IMPLEMENTATION OF THE CONTROLS AND THEIR EFFECT ON THE

INFORMATION GENERATED FOR USE IN THIS

FORM

10-K.

IN THE

COURSE OF THE CONTROLS EVALUATION, WE REVIEWED IDENTIFIED DATA

ERRORS, CONTROL PROBLEMS OR ACTS OF FRAUD AND SOUGHT TO CONFIRM

THAT APPROPRIATE CORRECTIVE ACTIONS, INCLUDING PROCESS

IMPROVEMENTS, WERE BEING UNDERTAKEN. THIS TYPE OF EVALUATION IS

PERFORMED ON A QUARTERLY BASIS SO THAT THE CONCLUSIONS OF

MANAGEMENT, INCLUDING THE CEO AND CFO, CONCERNING THE

EFFECTIVENESS OF THE DISCLOSURE CONTROLS CAN BE REPORTED IN OUR

PERIODIC REPORTS ON

FORM

10-Q

AND

FORM

10-K.

MANY OF

THE COMPONENTS OF OUR DISCLOSURE CONTROLS ARE ALSO EVALUATED ON

AN ONGOING BASIS BY OUR INTERNAL AUDIT DEPARTMENT AND BY OTHER

PERSONNEL IN OUR FINANCE AND ENTERPRISE SERVICES ORGANIZATION.

THE OVERALL GOALS OF THESE VARIOUS EVALUATION ACTIVITIES ARE TO

MONITOR OUR DISCLOSURE CONTROLS, AND TO MODIFY THEM AS

NECESSARY. OUR INTENT IS TO MAINTAIN THE DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AS

DYNAMIC SYSTEMS THAT CHANGE AS CONDITIONS WARRANT.

BASED UPON THE CONTROLS EVALUATION, OUR CEO AND CFO HAVE

CONCLUDED THAT, AS OF THE END OF THE PERIOD COVERED BY THIS

FORM

10-K,

OUR

DISCLOSURE CONTROLS WERE EFFECTIVE TO PROVIDE REASONABLE

ASSURANCE THAT INFORMATION REQUIRED TO BE DISCLOSED IN OUR

EXCHANGE ACT REPORTS IS RECORDED, PROCESSED, SUMMARIZED AND

REPORTED WITHIN THE TIME PERIODS SPECIFIED BY THE SEC, AND THAT

MATERIAL INFORMATION RELATED TO INTEL AND ITS CONSOLIDATED

SUBSIDIARIES IS MADE KNOWN TO MANAGEMENT, INCLUDING THE CEO AND

CFO, PARTICULARLY DURING THE PERIOD WHEN OUR PERIODIC REPORTS

ARE BEING PREPARED.

MANAGEMENT REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL

REPORTING

OUR MANAGEMENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ESTABLISHING AND MAINTAINING

ADEQUATE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING TO PROVIDE

REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING THE RELIABILITY OF OUR FINANCIAL

REPORTING AND THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR

EXTERNAL PURPOSES IN ACCORDANCE WITH U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED

ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES. INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

INCLUDES THOSE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES THAT (I) PERTAIN TO

THE MAINTENANCE OF RECORDS THAT IN REASONABLE DETAIL ACCURATELY

AND FAIRLY REFLECT THE TRANSACTIONS AND DISPOSITIONS OF THE

ASSETS OF THE COMPANY; (II) PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE

THAT TRANSACTIONS ARE RECORDED AS NECESSARY TO PERMIT

PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH U.S.

GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES, AND THAT RECEIPTS AND

EXPENDITURES OF THE COMPANY ARE BEING MADE ONLY IN ACCORDANCE

WITH AUTHORIZATIONS OF MANAGEMENT AND DIRECTORS OF THE COMPANY;

AND (III) PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING PREVENTION

OR TIMELY DETECTION OF UNAUTHORIZED ACQUISITION, USE OR

DISPOSITION OF THE COMPANYS ASSETS THAT COULD HAVE A

MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

MANAGEMENT ASSESSED OUR INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL

REPORTING AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2005, THE END OF OUR FISCAL

YEAR. MANAGEMENT BASED ITS ASSESSMENT ON CRITERIA ESTABLISHED IN

INTERNAL CONTROLINTEGRATED FRAMEWORK ISSUED BY THE

COMMITTEE OF SPONSORING ORGANIZATIONS OF THE TREADWAY

COMMISSION. MANAGEMENTS ASSESSMENT INCLUDED EVALUATION OF

SUCH ELEMENTS AS THE DESIGN AND OPERATING EFFECTIVENESS OF KEY

FINANCIAL REPORTING CONTROLS, PROCESS DOCUMENTATION, ACCOUNTING

POLICIES AND OUR OVERALL CONTROL ENVIRONMENT. THIS ASSESSMENT IS

SUPPORTED BY TESTING AND MONITORING PERFORMED BY BOTH OUR

INTERNAL AUDIT ORGANIZATION AND OUR FINANCE AND ENTERPRISE

SERVICES ORGANIZATION.

BASED ON OUR ASSESSMENT, MANAGEMENT HAS CONCLUDED THAT OUR

INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING WAS EFFECTIVE AS OF

THE END OF THE FISCAL YEAR TO PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE

REGARDING THE RELIABILITY OF FINANCIAL REPORTING AND THE

PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR EXTERNAL REPORTING

PURPOSES IN ACCORDANCE WITH U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING

PRINCIPLES. WE REVIEWED THE RESULTS OF MANAGEMENTS

ASSESSMENT WITH THE AUDIT COMMITTEE OF OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS.

IN ADDITION, ON A QUARTERLY BASIS WE EVALUATE ANY CHANGES TO OUR

INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING TO DETERMINE IF

MATERIAL CHANGES OCCURRED.

OUR INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM,

ERNST & YOUNG LLP, AUDITED MANAGEMENTS ASSESSMENT

AND INDEPENDENTLY ASSESSED THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE

COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING.

ERNST & YOUNG HAS ISSUED AN ATTESTATION REPORT

CONCURRING WITH MANAGEMENTS ASSESSMENT, WHICH IS INCLUDED

AT THE END OF PART II, ITEM 8 OF THIS

FORM

10-K.

INHERENT LIMITATIONS ON EFFECTIVENESS OF CONTROLS

THE COMPANYS MANAGEMENT, INCLUDING THE CEO AND CFO, DOES

NOT EXPECT THAT OUR DISCLOSURE CONTROLS OR OUR INTERNAL CONTROL

OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING WILL PREVENT OR DETECT ALL ERROR AND

ALL FRAUD. A CONTROL SYSTEM, NO MATTER HOW WELL DESIGNED AND

OPERATED, CAN PROVIDE ONLY REASONABLE, NOT ABSOLUTE, ASSURANCE

THAT THE CONTROL SYSTEMS OBJECTIVES WILL BE MET. THE

DESIGN OF A CONTROL SYSTEM MUST REFLECT THE FACT THAT THERE ARE

RESOURCE CONSTRAINTS, AND THE BENEFITS OF CONTROLS MUST BE

CONSIDERED RELATIVE TO THEIR COSTS. FURTHER, BECAUSE OF THE

INHERENT LIMITATIONS IN ALL CONTROL SYSTEMS, NO EVALUATION OF

CONTROLS CAN PROVIDE ABSOLUTE ASSURANCE THAT MISSTATEMENTS DUE

TO ERROR OR FRAUD WILL NOT OCCUR OR THAT ALL CONTROL ISSUES AND

INSTANCES OF FRAUD, IF ANY, WITHIN THE COMPANY HAVE BEEN

DETECTED. THESE INHERENT LIMITATIONS INCLUDE THE REALITIES THAT

JUDGMENTS IN DECISION-MAKING CAN BE FAULTY AND THAT BREAKDOWNS

CAN OCCUR BECAUSE OF SIMPLE ERROR OR MISTAKE. CONTROLS CAN ALSO

BE CIRCUMVENTED BY THE INDIVIDUAL ACTS OF SOME PERSONS, BY

COLLUSION OF TWO OR MORE PEOPLE, OR BY MANAGEMENT OVERRIDE OF

THE CONTROLS. THE DESIGN OF ANY SYSTEM OF CONTROLS IS BASED IN

PART ON CERTAIN ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT THE LIKELIHOOD OF FUTURE

EVENTS, AND THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT ANY DESIGN WILL

SUCCEED IN ACHIEVING ITS STATED GOALS UNDER ALL POTENTIAL FUTURE

CONDITIONS. PROJECTIONS OF ANY EVALUATION OF CONTROLS

EFFECTIVENESS TO FUTURE PERIODS ARE SUBJECT TO RISKS. OVER TIME,

CONTROLS MAY BECOME INADEQUATE BECAUSE OF CHANGES IN CONDITIONS

OR DETERIORATION IN THE DEGREE OF COMPLIANCE WITH POLICIES OR

PROCEDURES.
