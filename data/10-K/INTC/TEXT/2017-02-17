ITEM 1.

BUSINESS

COMPANY OVERVIEW

WE ARE A WORLD LEADER IN THE DESIGN AND MANUFACTURING OF ESSENTIAL PRODUCTS AND TECHNOLOGIES THAT POWER THE CLOUD AND AN INCREASINGLY SMART, CONNECTED WORLD. INTEL DELIVERS COMPUTER, NETWORKING, AND COMMUNICATIONS PLATFORMS TO A BROAD SET OF CUSTOMERS INCLUDING ORIGINAL EQUIPMENT MANUFACTURERS (OEMS), ORIGINAL DESIGN MANUFACTURERS (ODMS), CLOUD AND COMMUNICATIONS SERVICE PROVIDERS, AS WELL AS INDUSTRIAL, COMMUNICATIONS AND AUTOMOTIVE EQUIPMENT MANUFACTURERS. WE ARE EXPANDING THE BOUNDARIES OF TECHNOLOGY THROUGH OUR RELENTLESS PURSUIT OF MOORE’S LAW AND COMPUTING BREAKTHROUGHS THAT MAKE AMAZING EXPERIENCES POSSIBLE. WE WERE INCORPORATED IN CALIFORNIA IN 1968 AND REINCORPORATED IN DELAWARE IN 1989.

COMPANY STRATEGY

OUR VISION IS IF IT IS SMART AND CONNECTED, IT IS BEST WITH INTEL

®

. AS A RESULT, OUR STRATEGY IS TO DRIVE A "VIRTUOUS CYCLE OF GROWTH" THAT ENABLES THE EXPANSION OF THE DATA CENTER AS WELL AS THE PROLIFERATION OF SMART, CONNECTED THINGS AND DEVICES, WHILE CONTINUING TO FUEL TECHNOLOGY WITH THE ECONOMICS OF MOORE'S LAW.

PEOPLE ARE EXPERIENCING A DRAMATIC SHIFT IN THEIR RELATIONSHIP TO TECHNOLOGY AS THINGS AND DEVICES BECOME INCREASINGLY CONNECTED TO EACH OTHER AND THE CLOUD, MERGING THE DIGITAL AND PHYSICAL WORLDS. COMPUTING IS BECOMING PERVASIVE EVERYWHERE AND IN EVERYTHING. THE VIRTUOUS CYCLE OF GROWTH LEVERAGES INTEL'S CORE ASSETS TO POWER THE CLOUD AND DRIVE THE INCREASINGLY SMART AND CONNECTED WORLD.

VIRTUOUS CYCLE OF GROWTH

OUR BUSINESSES ACROSS THE CLOUD AND DATA CENTER, THROUGH THINGS AND DEVICES, ARE ACCELERATED BY MEMORY AND FIELD-PROGRAMMABLE GATE ARRAY (FPGA) TECHNOLOGIES—ALL OF WHICH ARE BOUND TOGETHER BY CONNECTIVITY AND ENHANCED BY THE ECONOMICS OF MOORE'S LAW. WE FURTHER TRANSFORM THESE TECHNOLOGIES TO DELIVER COMPELLING USER EXPERIENCES.

•

THE CLOUD AND DATA CENTER.

WE BELIEVE THAT THE MOST IMPORTANT TREND SHAPING THE FUTURE OF THE SMART AND CONNECTED WORLD IS THE CLOUD. WE DESIGN AND OPTIMIZE OUR PRODUCTS TO DELIVER INDUSTRY LEADING PERFORMANCE AND BEST IN CLASS TOTAL COST OF OWNERSHIP FOR CLOUD WORKLOADS. INTEL IS ADDING NEW PRODUCTS AND FEATURES TO OUR PORTFOLIO TO ADDRESS EMERGING, HIGH GROWTH WORKLOADS SUCH AS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE, MEDIA, AND 5G.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

•

THINGS AND DEVICES.

THINGS AND DEVICES ENCOMPASS ALL SMART DEVICES, INCLUDING PCS, SENSORS, CONSOLES, AND OTHER EDGE DEVICES THAT ARE CONNECTED TO THE CLOUD. WHEN A "THING" IS CONNECTED TO THE CLOUD, THE DATA IT CAPTURES CAN BE MEASURED IN REAL TIME AND ACCESSED VIRTUALLY FROM ANYWHERE. WE WILL CONTINUE TO DELIVER LEADERSHIP, PERFORMANCE, AND INNOVATION IN PCS. IN OUR INTERNET OF THINGS BUSINESS, WE FOCUS OUR INVESTMENTS ON AREAS WHERE WE SEE GROWTH POTENTIAL, SUCH AS THE AUTONOMOUS VEHICLE, INDUSTRIAL, AND RETAIL MARKET SEGMENTS.

•

MEMORY AND PROGRAMMABLE SOLUTIONS.

ADVANCEMENTS IN MEMORY TECHNOLOGY AND PROGRAMMABLE SOLUTIONS, SUCH AS FPGAS, MAKE POSSIBLE ENTIRELY NEW CLASSES OF PRODUCTS FOR THE DATA CENTER AND INTERNET OF THINGS. THE NEED FOR FASTER STORAGE AND GREATER MEMORY CAPACITY UNLOCKS VALUE IN THE CLOUD AS THE DEMAND TO AUTOMATE AND ANALYZE EXPONENTIAL QUANTITIES OF DATA INCREASES. FPGAS CAN EFFICIENTLY MANAGE THE CHANGING WORKLOAD DEMANDS OF NEXT-GENERATION DATA CENTERS AND OFFER THE FLEXIBILITY FOR USERS TO CHANGE THEIR WORKLOADS REAL-TIME. FPGAS ARE ALSO USED IN A WIDE RANGE OF OTHER APPLICATIONS, SUCH AS MACHINE LEARNING AND ADVANCED DRIVER ASSISTANCE SYSTEMS.

•

CONNECTIVITY.

AS THE CONNECTIVITY TECHNOLOGIES CONTINUE TO EVOLVE, MORE THINGS AND DEVICES ARE ABLE TO CONNECT WITH EACH OTHER AND THE CLOUD. THE ABILITY TO CONNECT, AND TO DERIVE ACTIONABLE INSIGHTS FROM MASSIVE AMOUNTS OF DATA BRINGS NEW EXPERIENCES TO OUR DAILY LIVES AND TRANSFORMS BUSINESSES.

•

MOORE'S LAW.

OUR CO-FOUNDER GORDON MOORE PREDICTED, IN WHAT IS KNOWN AS MOORE'S LAW, THAT TRANSISTOR DENSITY ON INTEGRATED CIRCUITS WOULD DOUBLE ABOUT EVERY TWO YEARS. INTEL’S ADVANCEMENT OF MOORE’S LAW HAS DRIVEN SIGNIFICANT COMPUTING POWER GROWTH AND INCREASINGLY BETTER ECONOMICS AND PRICING. WE WILL CONTINUE TO HARNESS THE VALUE OF MOORE'S LAW BY ENABLING NEW DEVICES WITH HIGHER FUNCTIONALITY AND COMPLEXITY WHILE CONTROLLING POWER, COST, AND SIZE.

LEVERAGING OUR CORE ASSETS ENHANCES OUR STRATEGY AND PROVIDES US WITH THE SCALE, CAPACITY, AND GLOBAL REACH TO ESTABLISH NEW TECHNOLOGIES AND RESPOND TO CUSTOMERS’ NEEDS QUICKLY. OUR CORE ASSETS INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING.

•

SILICON AND MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY LEADERSHIP.

WE HAVE LONG BEEN THE LEADER IN SILICON MANUFACTURING PROCESS TECHNOLOGY AND WE AIM TO CONTINUE OUR LEAD THROUGH INVESTMENT AND INNOVATION IN THIS CRITICAL AREA. UNLIKE MANY OTHER SEMICONDUCTOR COMPANIES, WE PRIMARILY MANUFACTURE OUR PRODUCTS IN OUR OWN MANUFACTURING FACILITIES, WHICH ENABLES US TO OPTIMIZE PERFORMANCE, SHORTEN OUR TIME-TO-MARKET, AND SCALE NEW PRODUCTS MORE RAPIDLY. WE BELIEVE THIS COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE WILL BE EXTENDED IN THE FUTURE AS THE COSTS TO BUILD LEADING-EDGE FABRICATION FACILITIES INCREASE OVER TIME.

•

ARCHITECTURE AND PLATFORMS.

WE ARE ABLE TO SHARE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY ACROSS OUR PLATFORMS AND OPERATING SEGMENTS, WHICH REDUCES OUR COSTS AND PROVIDES A HIGHER RETURN ON CAPITAL IN OUR GROWTH MARKET SEGMENTS. THE COMBINATION OF OUR SHARED INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY PORTFOLIO AND OUR INTERCHANGEABLE MANUFACTURING ASSETS ALLOWS US TO SEAMLESSLY SHIFT OUR PRODUCTION CAPABILITIES TO RESPOND TO MARKET DEMAND. WE CONTINUE TO INVEST IN IMPROVING INTEL ARCHITECTURE AND PRODUCT PLATFORMS TO DELIVER INCREASED VALUE TO OUR CUSTOMERS AND EXPAND THE CAPABILITIES OF THE ARCHITECTURE IN ADJACENT MARKET SEGMENTS.

•

SOFTWARE AND SERVICES.

WE OFFER SOFTWARE AND SERVICES THAT PROVIDE SOLUTIONS THROUGH A COMBINATION OF HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE FOR CONSUMER AND CORPORATE ENVIRONMENTS AND THAT ASSIST SOFTWARE DEVELOPERS IN CREATING SOFTWARE APPLICATIONS THAT TAKE ADVANTAGE OF OUR PLATFORMS.

•

CUSTOMER ORIENTATION.

WE FOCUS ON PROVIDING COMPELLING USER EXPERIENCES BY DEVELOPING OUR NEXT GENERATION OF PRODUCTS BASED ON CUSTOMER NEEDS AND EXPECTATIONS. IN TURN, OUR PRODUCTS HELP ENABLE THE DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT OF NEW USER EXPERIENCES, FORM FACTORS, AND USAGE MODELS. WE OFFER PLATFORMS THAT INCORPORATE VARIOUS COMPONENTS AND CAPABILITIES DESIGNED AND CONFIGURED TO WORK TOGETHER TO PROVIDE AN OPTIMIZED SOLUTION THAT CUSTOMERS CAN EASILY INTEGRATE INTO THEIR PRODUCTS.

•

ACQUISITIONS AND STRATEGIC INVESTMENTS.

WE INVEST IN COMPANIES AROUND THE WORLD THAT WE BELIEVE WILL FURTHER OUR STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES, STIMULATE GROWTH IN THE DIGITAL ECONOMY, CREATE NEW BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES FOR INTEL, AND GENERATE FINANCIAL RETURNS. OUR INVESTMENTS TAKE DIFFERENT FORMS, INCLUDING ACQUISITION OF COMPANIES TO FURTHER ADVANCE OUR STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES, WHICH IS EXEMPLIFIED BY OUR ACQUISITION OF ALTERA CORPORATION (ALTERA) IN Q1 2016. THROUGH THE ALTERA ACQUISITION, WE ARE ABLE TO COMBINE PROGRAMMABLE SOLUTIONS WITH OUR LEADING-EDGE PRODUCTS AND MANUFACTURING PROCESS TO ENABLE NEW CLASSES OF PRODUCTS FOR THE DATA CENTER AND INTERNET OF THINGS MARKET SEGMENTS.

OUR R&D ACTIVITIES ARE DIRECTED TOWARD THE DELIVERY OF SOLUTIONS CONSISTING OF HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE PLATFORMS AND SUPPORTING SERVICES ACROSS A WIDE RANGE OF COMPUTING DEVICES. WE ARE FOCUSED ON DEVELOPING THE TECHNOLOGY INNOVATIONS THAT WE BELIEVE WILL DELIVER OUR NEXT GENERATION OF PRODUCTS, WHICH WILL IN TURN ENABLE NEW FORM FACTORS AND USAGE MODELS FOR BUSINESSES AND CONSUMERS. WE FOCUS OUR R&D EFFORTS ON ADVANCED COMPUTING TECHNOLOGIES, DEVELOPING NEW MICROARCHITECTURES, ADVANCING OUR SILICON MANUFACTURING PROCESS TECHNOLOGY, DELIVERING THE NEXT GENERATION OF PLATFORMS, IMPROVING OUR PLATFORM INITIATIVES, DEVELOPING NEW SOLUTIONS IN EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES (INCLUDING MEMORY AND THE INTERNET OF THINGS), AND DEVELOPING SOFTWARE SOLUTIONS AND TOOLS. OUR R&D EFFORTS ARE INTENDED TO ENABLE NEW LEVELS OF PERFORMANCE AND ADDRESS AREAS SUCH AS ENERGY EFFICIENCY, SYSTEM-LEVEL INTEGRATION, SECURITY, SCALABILITY FOR MULTI-CORE ARCHITECTURES, SYSTEM MANAGEABILITY, AND EASE OF USE.

AS PART OF OUR R&D EFFORTS, WE PLAN TO INTRODUCE NEW MICROARCHITECTURES FOR OUR VARIOUS PRODUCTS ON A REGULAR CADENCE. WE EXPECT TO LENGTHEN THE AMOUNT OF TIME WE WILL UTILIZE OUR 14NM AND OUR NEXT-GENERATION 10NM PROCESS TECHNOLOGIES WITH MULTIPLE WAVES OF PRODUCT OFFERINGS, FURTHER OPTIMIZING OUR TECHNOLOGIES WHILE MEETING THE YEARLY MARKET CADENCE FOR PRODUCT INTRODUCTIONS.

ADVANCES IN OUR SILICON TECHNOLOGY HAVE ENABLED US TO CONTINUE MAKING MOORE’S LAW A REALITY. IN 2014, WE BEGAN MANUFACTURING OUR 5TH GENERATION INTEL CORE PROCESSOR FAMILY USING OUR 14 NM PROCESS TECHNOLOGY. IN 2015, WE RELEASED A NEW MICROARCHITECTURE (OUR 6TH GENERATION INTEL CORE PROCESSOR FAMILY), USING OUR 14NM PROCESS TECHNOLOGY. WE ENHANCED THE 14NM PROCESS ON OUR 7TH GENERATION INTEL CORE PROCESSOR FAMILY IN 2016 AND PLAN TO FURTHER OPTIMIZE OUR TECHNOLOGIES WITH THE UPCOMING 8TH GENERATION INTEL CORE PROCESSOR FAMILY IN 2017. WE CONTINUE TO MAKE PROGRESS ON DEVELOPING OUR NEXT-GENERATION 10NM MANUFACTURING PROCESS TECHNOLOGY.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

WE HAVE CONTINUED EXPANDING ON THE ADVANCES ANTICIPATED BY MOORE’S LAW BY BRINGING NEW CAPABILITIES INTO SILICON AND PRODUCING NEW PRODUCTS OPTIMIZED FOR A WIDER VARIETY OF APPLICATIONS. WE EXPECT THAT THESE ADVANCES WILL RESULT IN A SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN TRANSISTOR LEAKAGE, LOWER ACTIVE POWER, AND AN INCREASE IN TRANSISTOR DENSITY. THESE ADVANCES IN OUR PROCESS TECHNOLOGIES WILL ENABLE NEW CLASSES OF PRODUCTS, FROM SMART AND CONNECTED THINGS AND DEVICES TO HIGH PERFORMANCE SYSTEMS THAT POWER DATA CENTERS. FOR INSTANCE, WE OFFER THE INTEL

JOULETM COMPUTE MODULE, A HIGH-PERFORMANCE SYSTEM-ON-MODULE DESIGNED TO ENABLE DEVELOPERS AND ENTREPRENEURS TO GO FROM CONCEPT TO PROTOTYPE TO PRODUCTION IN LESS TIME AND AT LOWER COST THAN WITH TRADITIONAL SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT.

WITH OUR CONTINUED FOCUS ON SILICON AND MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY LEADERSHIP, WE ENTERED INTO A SERIES OF AGREEMENTS WITH ASML HOLDING N.V. (ASML) IN 2012, CERTAIN OF WHICH WERE AMENDED IN 2014 TO FURTHER DEFINE THE COMMERCIAL TERMS BETWEEN THE PARTIES. THESE AMENDED AGREEMENTS, IN WHICH INTEL AGREED TO PROVIDE R&D FUNDING OVER FIVE YEARS, ARE INTENDED TO ACCELERATE THE DEVELOPMENT OF EXTREME ULTRAVIOLET (EUV) LITHOGRAPHY PROJECTS AND DEEP ULTRAVIOLET IMMERSION LITHOGRAPHY PROJECTS, INCLUDING GENERIC DEVELOPMENTS APPLICABLE TO BOTH 300MM AND 450MM.

OUR R&D ACTIVITIES INCLUDE INITIATIVES THAT FURTHER ENHANCE OUR PLATFORM SOLUTIONS, FOR EXAMPLE.

•

THE DEVELOPMENT OF MULTI-MODE LTE* AND 5G TECHNOLOGY, WHICH BRINGS CONNECTIVITY CAPABILITY TO SMART AND CONNECTED DEVICES AND WILL POWER THE 5G NETWORK INFRASTRUCTURE;

•

MEMORY TECHNOLOGY INNOVATION WITH 3D XPOINTTM AND 3D NAND TECHNOLOGIES, WHICH ENABLES HIGHER DENSITY AND HIGH PERFORMANCE STORAGE AND SYSTEM MEMORY SOLUTIONS;

•

INTEGRATION OF FPGA TECHNOLOGY, WHICH ENABLES NEW CLASSES OF PRODUCTS FOR THE DATA CENTER AND INTERNET OF THINGS MARKET SEGMENTS; AND

•

OTHER INITIATIVES, SUCH AS LEADING-EDGE FOUNDRY PLATFORMS, ECOSYSTEM PARTNER DEVELOPMENT, GRAPHICS, AND HIGH-PERFORMANCE COMPUTING.

OUR R&D MODEL IS BASED ON A GLOBAL ORGANIZATION THAT EMPHASIZES A COLLABORATIVE APPROACH TO IDENTIFYING AND DEVELOPING NEW TECHNOLOGIES, LEADING STANDARDS INITIATIVES, AND INFLUENCING REGULATORY POLICIES TO ACCELERATE THE ADOPTION OF NEW TECHNOLOGIES, INCLUDING JOINT PATHFINDING CONDUCTED BETWEEN RESEARCHERS AT INTEL LABS AND OUR BUSINESS GROUPS. WE CENTRALLY MANAGE KEY CROSS-BUSINESS GROUP PRODUCT INITIATIVES TO ALIGN AND PRIORITIZE OUR R&D ACTIVITIES ACROSS THESE GROUPS. IN ADDITION, WE MAY AUGMENT OUR R&D ACTIVITIES BY INVESTING IN COMPANIES OR ENTERING INTO AGREEMENTS WITH COMPANIES THAT HAVE SIMILAR R&D FOCUS AREAS, AS WELL AS DIRECTLY PURCHASING OR LICENSING TECHNOLOGY APPLICABLE TO OUR R&D INITIATIVES. TO DRIVE INNOVATION AND GAIN EFFICIENCIES, WE INTEND TO UTILIZE OUR INVESTMENTS IN INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND R&D ACROSS OUR MARKET SEGMENTS.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

SALES ARRANGEMENTS

OUR PRODUCTS ARE SOLD THROUGH SALES OFFICES THROUGHOUT THE WORLD. SALES OF OUR PRODUCTS ARE FREQUENTLY MADE VIA PURCHASE ORDER ACKNOWLEDGMENTS THAT CONTAIN STANDARD TERMS AND CONDITIONS COVERING MATTERS SUCH AS PRICING, PAYMENT TERMS, AND WARRANTIES, AS WELL AS INDEMNITIES FOR ISSUES SPECIFIC TO OUR PRODUCTS, SUCH AS PATENT AND COPYRIGHT INDEMNITIES. FROM TIME TO TIME, WE MAY ENTER INTO ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS WITH CUSTOMERS COVERING, FOR EXAMPLE, CHANGES FROM OUR STANDARD TERMS AND CONDITIONS, NEW PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT AND MARKETING, PRIVATE-LABEL BRANDING, AND OTHER MATTERS. OUR SALES ARE ROUTINELY MADE USING ELECTRONIC AND WEB-BASED PROCESSES THAT ALLOW THE CUSTOMER TO REVIEW INVENTORY AVAILABILITY AND TRACK THE PROGRESS OF SPECIFIC GOODS ORDERED. PRICING ON PARTICULAR PRODUCTS MAY VARY BASED ON VOLUMES ORDERED AND OTHER FACTORS. WE ALSO OFFER DISCOUNTS, REBATES, AND OTHER INCENTIVES TO CUSTOMERS TO INCREASE ACCEPTANCE OF OUR PRODUCTS AND TECHNOLOGY.

OUR PRODUCTS ARE GENERALLY SHIPPED UNDER TERMS THAT TRANSFER TITLE TO THE CUSTOMER, EVEN IN ARRANGEMENTS FOR WHICH THE RECOGNITION OF REVENUE AND RELATED COST OF SALES IS DEFERRED. OUR STANDARD TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF SALE TYPICALLY PROVIDE THAT PAYMENT IS DUE AT A LATER DATE, USUALLY 30 DAYS AFTER SHIPMENT OR DELIVERY.

WE ASSESS CREDIT RISK THROUGH QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE ANALYSIS. FROM THIS ANALYSIS, WE ESTABLISH SHIPPING AND CREDIT LIMITS, AND DETERMINE WHETHER WE WILL SEEK TO USE ONE OR MORE CREDIT SUPPORT PROTECTION DEVICES, SUCH AS OBTAINING A PARENT GUARANTEE, STANDBY LETTER OF CREDIT, OR CREDIT INSURANCE.

CREDIT LOSSES MAY STILL BE INCURRED DUE TO BANKRUPTCY, FRAUD, OR OTHER FAILURE OF THE CUSTOMER TO PAY.

OUR SALES TO DISTRIBUTORS ARE TYPICALLY MADE UNDER AGREEMENTS ALLOWING FOR PRICE PROTECTION ON UNSOLD MERCHANDISE AND A RIGHT OF RETURN ON STIPULATED QUANTITIES OF UNSOLD MERCHANDISE. UNDER THE PRICE PROTECTION PROGRAM, WE GIVE DISTRIBUTORS CREDITS FOR THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE ORIGINAL PRICE PAID AND THE CURRENT PRICE THAT WE OFFER. OUR PRODUCTS TYPICALLY HAVE NO CONTRACTUAL LIMIT ON THE AMOUNT OF PRICE PROTECTION, NOR IS THERE A LIMIT ON THE TIME HORIZON UNDER WHICH PRICE PROTECTION IS GRANTED. THE RIGHT OF RETURN GRANTED GENERALLY CONSISTS OF A STOCK ROTATION PROGRAM IN WHICH DISTRIBUTORS ARE ABLE TO EXCHANGE CERTAIN PRODUCTS BASED ON THE NUMBER OF QUALIFIED PURCHASES MADE BY THE DISTRIBUTOR.

DISTRIBUTION

DISTRIBUTORS TYPICALLY HANDLE A WIDE VARIETY OF PRODUCTS, INCLUDING THOSE THAT COMPETE WITH OUR PRODUCTS, AND FILL ORDERS FOR MANY CUSTOMERS. CUSTOMERS MAY PLACE ORDERS DIRECTLY WITH US OR THROUGH DISTRIBUTORS. WE HAVE SEVERAL DISTRIBUTION WAREHOUSES THAT ARE LOCATED IN PROXIMITY TO KEY CUSTOMERS.

BACKLOG

OVER TIME, OUR LARGER CUSTOMERS HAVE GENERALLY MOVED TO LEAN-INVENTORY OR JUST-IN-TIME OPERATIONS RATHER THAN MAINTAINING LARGER INVENTORIES OF OUR PRODUCTS. AS OUR CUSTOMERS CONTINUE TO LOWER THEIR INVENTORIES, OUR PROCESSES TO FULFILL THEIR ORDERS HAVE EVOLVED TO MEET THEIR NEEDS. AS A RESULT, OUR MANUFACTURING PRODUCTION IS BASED ON ESTIMATES AND ADVANCE NON-BINDING COMMITMENTS FROM CUSTOMERS AS TO FUTURE PURCHASES. OUR ORDER BACKLOG AS OF ANY PARTICULAR DATE IS A MIX OF THESE COMMITMENTS AND SPECIFIC FIRM ORDERS THAT ARE PRIMARILY MADE PURSUANT TO STANDARD PURCHASE ORDERS FOR DELIVERY OF PRODUCTS. ONLY A SMALL PORTION OF OUR ORDERS ARE NON-CANCELABLE, AND THE DOLLAR AMOUNT ASSOCIATED WITH THE NON-CANCELABLE PORTION IS NOT SIGNIFICANT.

SEASONAL TRENDS

HISTORICALLY, OUR NET REVENUE HAS TYPICALLY BEEN HIGHER IN THE SECOND HALF OF THE YEAR THAN IN THE FIRST HALF OF THE YEAR, ACCELERATING IN THE THIRD QUARTER AND PEAKING IN THE FOURTH QUARTER.

MARKETING

OUR GLOBAL MARKETING OBJECTIVES ARE TO BUILD A STRONG, WELL-KNOWN INTEL CORPORATE BRAND THAT CONNECTS WITH BUSINESSES AND CONSUMERS, AND TO OFFER A LIMITED NUMBER OF MEANINGFUL AND VALUABLE BRANDS IN OUR PORTFOLIO TO AID BUSINESSES AND CONSUMERS IN MAKING INFORMED CHOICES ABOUT TECHNOLOGY PURCHASES.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

WE PROMOTE BRAND AWARENESS AND PREFERENCE, AND GENERATE DEMAND THROUGH OUR OWN DIRECT MARKETING AS WELL AS THROUGH CO-MARKETING PROGRAMS. OUR DIRECT MARKETING ACTIVITIES PRIMARILY INCLUDE ADVERTISING THROUGH DIGITAL AND SOCIAL MEDIA AND TELEVISION, AS WELL AS CONSUMER AND TRADE EVENTS, INDUSTRY AND CONSUMER COMMUNICATIONS, AND PRESS RELATIONS. WE MARKET TO CONSUMER AND BUSINESS AUDIENCES, AND FOCUS ON BUILDING AWARENESS AND GENERATING DEMAND FOR NEW FORM FACTORS SUCH AS ALL-IN-ONE DEVICES AND 2 IN 1 SYSTEMS POWERED BY INTEL. OUR KEY MESSAGING FOCUSES ON INCREASED PERFORMANCE, IMPROVED ENERGY EFFICIENCY, AND OTHER CAPABILITIES SUCH AS CONNECTIVITY AND COMMUNICATIONS.

PURCHASES BY CUSTOMERS OFTEN ALLOW THEM TO PARTICIPATE IN COOPERATIVE ADVERTISING AND MARKETING PROGRAMS SUCH AS THE INTEL INSIDE

BRANDS, SUBJECT TO CUSTOMERS MEETING DEFINED CRITERIA. THESE MARKETING ACTIVITIES PRIMARILY INCLUDE ADVERTISING THROUGH DIGITAL AND SOCIAL MEDIA AND TELEVISION, AS WELL AS PRESS RELATIONS. WE HAVE ALSO ENTERED INTO JOINT MARKETING ARRANGEMENTS WITH CERTAIN CUSTOMERS.

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS AND LICENSING

INTEL OWNS SIGNIFICANT INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY (IP) AND RELATED IP RIGHTS AROUND THE WORLD THAT RELATE TO OUR PRODUCTS, SERVICES, R&D, AND OTHER ACTIVITIES AND ASSETS. OUR IP PORTFOLIO INCLUDES PATENTS, COPYRIGHTS, TRADE SECRETS, TRADEMARKS, TRADE DRESS RIGHTS, AND MASKWORK RIGHTS. WE ACTIVELY SEEK TO PROTECT OUR GLOBAL IP RIGHTS AND TO DETER UNAUTHORIZED USE OF OUR IP AND OTHER ASSETS. SUCH EFFORTS CAN BE DIFFICULT, HOWEVER, PARTICULARLY IN COUNTRIES THAT PROVIDE LESS PROTECTION TO IP RIGHTS AND IN THE ABSENCE OF HARMONIZED INTERNATIONAL IP STANDARDS. WHILE OUR IP RIGHTS ARE IMPORTANT TO OUR SUCCESS, OUR BUSINESS AS A WHOLE IS NOT SIGNIFICANTLY DEPENDENT ON ANY SINGLE PATENT, COPYRIGHT, OR OTHER IP RIGHT.

WE HAVE OBTAINED PATENTS IN THE U.S. AND OTHER COUNTRIES. BECAUSE OF THE FAST PACE OF INNOVATION AND PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT, AND THE COMPARATIVE PACE OF GOVERNMENTS’ PATENTING PROCESSES, OUR PRODUCTS ARE OFTEN OBSOLETE BEFORE THE PATENTS RELATED TO THEM EXPIRE; IN SOME CASES, OUR PRODUCTS MAY BE OBSOLETE BEFORE THE PATENTS RELATED TO THEM ARE GRANTED. AS WE EXPAND OUR PRODUCTS INTO NEW INDUSTRIES, WE ALSO SEEK TO EXTEND OUR PATENT DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS TO PATENT SUCH PRODUCTS. IN ADDITION TO DEVELOPING PATENTS BASED ON OUR OWN R&D EFFORTS, WE PURCHASE PATENTS FROM THIRD PARTIES TO SUPPLEMENT OUR PATENT PORTFOLIO. ESTABLISHED COMPETITORS IN EXISTING AND NEW INDUSTRIES, AS WELL AS COMPANIES THAT PURCHASE AND ENFORCE PATENTS AND OTHER IP, MAY ALREADY HAVE PATENTS COVERING SIMILAR PRODUCTS. THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO OBTAIN PATENTS COVERING OUR OWN PRODUCTS, OR THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO OBTAIN LICENSES FROM OTHER COMPANIES ON FAVORABLE TERMS OR AT ALL.

THE SOFTWARE THAT WE DISTRIBUTE, INCLUDING SOFTWARE EMBEDDED IN OUR COMPONENT-LEVEL AND PLATFORM PRODUCTS, IS ENTITLED TO COPYRIGHT AND OTHER IP PROTECTION. TO DISTINGUISH OUR PRODUCTS FROM OUR COMPETITORS’ PRODUCTS, WE HAVE OBTAINED TRADEMARKS AND TRADE NAMES FOR OUR PRODUCTS, AND WE MAINTAIN COOPERATIVE ADVERTISING PROGRAMS WITH CUSTOMERS TO PROMOTE OUR BRANDS AND TO IDENTIFY PRODUCTS CONTAINING GENUINE INTEL COMPONENTS. WE ALSO PROTECT DETAILS ABOUT OUR PROCESSES, PRODUCTS, AND STRATEGIES AS TRADE SECRETS, KEEPING CONFIDENTIAL THE INFORMATION THAT WE BELIEVE PROVIDES US WITH A COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE.

CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY AND SUSTAINABILITY

WE HAVE A LONG HISTORY OF LEADERSHIP IN CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY AND SET AMBITIOUS GOALS AND DRIVE IMPROVEMENTS IN KEY FOCUS AREAS OF ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY, SUPPLY CHAIN RESPONSIBILITY, DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION, AND SOCIAL IMPACT.

WE ARE COMMITTED TO ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY AND TAKE A LEADERSHIP POSITION IN PROMOTING VOLUNTARY ENVIRONMENTAL INITIATIVES BY WORKING PROACTIVELY WITH GOVERNMENTS, ENVIRONMENTAL GROUPS, AND INDUSTRY. TO MINIMIZE THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT OF OUR GLOBAL MANUFACTURING OPERATIONS, WE INVEST IN CONSERVATION PROJECTS AND SET COMPANY-WIDE ENVIRONMENTAL TARGETS, SEEKING TO DRIVE REDUCTIONS IN GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS, ENERGY USE, WATER USE, AND WASTE GENERATION. FOR THE PAST NINE YEARS, WE HAVE BEEN THE LARGEST VOLUNTARY CORPORATE PURCHASER OF GREEN POWER IN THE U.S. ACCORDING TO THE U.S. ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY, HELPING TO STIMULATE THE MARKET FOR GREEN POWER AND REDUCE ENERGY COSTS. WE SEEK TO REDUCE THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT OF OUR PRODUCTS THROUGH PRODUCT ECOLOGY AND E-WASTE INITIATIVES AND BY DESIGNING PRODUCTS WITH IMPROVED ENERGY-EFFICIENT PERFORMANCE, WHICH HELPS US MEET CUSTOMER NEEDS AND IDENTIFY MARKET EXPANSION OPPORTUNITIES. WE BELIEVE THAT TECHNOLOGY WILL BE FUNDAMENTAL TO FINDING SOLUTIONS TO THE WORLD’S ENVIRONMENTAL CHALLENGES, AND WE ARE JOINING FORCES WITH OTHERS TO FIND AND PROMOTE WAYS THAT TECHNOLOGY CAN BE USED AS A TOOL TO ADDRESS CLIMATE CHANGE AND WATER CONSERVATION.

WE ARE COMMITTED TO ADVANCING SUPPLY CHAIN RESPONSIBILITY, AS WE BELIEVE THIS CREATES VALUE BY REDUCING RISK, IMPROVING PRODUCT QUALITY, AND RAISING THE OVERALL PERFORMANCE OF OUR SUPPLIERS. OUR EFFORTS ARE DESIGNED TO PROTECT VULNERABLE WORKERS THROUGHOUT THE GLOBAL SUPPLY CHAIN AND INCLUDE SETTING CLEAR SUPPLIER EXPECTATIONS, INVESTING IN ASSESSMENTS, AUDITS, AND CAPABILITY-BUILDING PROGRAMS, AND COLLECTIVELY ADDRESSING ISSUES THROUGH OUR LEADERSHIP IN THE ELECTRONIC INDUSTRY CITIZENSHIP COALITION (EICC). WE HAVE ALSO LED THE INDUSTRY ON THE CONFLICT MINERALS ISSUE AND HAVE WORKED EXTENSIVELY SINCE 2008 TO PUT IN PLACE PROCESSES AND SYSTEMS TO DEVELOP ETHICAL SOURCING OF TIN, TANTALUM, TUNGSTEN, AND GOLD FOR INTEL AND TO PREVENT PROFITS FROM THE SALE OF THOSE MINERALS FROM FUNDING CONFLICT IN THE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF THE CONGO (DRC) AND ADJOINING COUNTRIES. SINCE 2013, WE HAVE MANUFACTURED MICROPROCESSORS THAT ARE DRC CONFLICT-FREE FOR TANTALUM, TIN, TUNGSTEN, AND GOLD. WE CONTINUE OUR WORK TO ESTABLISH RESPONSIBLE MINERAL SUPPLY CHAINS FOR OUR COMPANY AS WELL AS OUR INDUSTRY.

DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION ARE INTEGRAL PARTS OF OUR CORPORATE STRATEGY AND VISION. WE BELIEVE THAT INVESTING IN TRAINING, DIVERSITY, BENEFITS PROGRAMS, AND EDUCATION HELPS US TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN A TALENTED WORKFORCE. IN 2015, INTEL SET A GOAL TO ACHIEVE FULL REPRESENTATION OF WOMEN AND UNDERREPRESENTED MINORITIES IN OUR U.S. WORKFORCE BY 2020, REFLECTING TALENT AVAILABLE IN THE MARKETPLACE. WE PLAN TO SPEND $300 MILLION TO SUPPORT THIS GOAL AND ACCELERATE DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION—NOT JUST AT INTEL, BUT ACROSS THE TECHNOLOGY INDUSTRY AT LARGE.

WE AND THE INTEL FOUNDATION, A CHARITABLE ORGANIZATION, ADVANCE SOCIAL IMPACT INITIATIVES AND COLLABORATIVE ENGAGEMENTS TO EMPOWER THE NEXT GENERATION OF INNOVATORS AND EXPAND ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY FOR YOUNG PEOPLE AROUND THE WORLD THROUGH PROGRAMS THAT INCREASE ACCESS TO TECHNOLOGY SKILLS AND PROVIDE HANDS-ON INNOVATION EXPERIENCES. OUR SOCIAL IMPACT INITIATIVES BUILD TRUST WITH KEY STAKEHOLDERS, SUPPORT OUR LONG-TERM TALENT AND DIVERSITY OBJECTIVES, AND SUPPORT EXPANSION OF FUTURE MARKET OPPORTUNITIES.

RISK FACTORS

THE FOLLOWING RISKS COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, AND THE TRADING PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK COULD DECLINE. THESE RISK FACTORS DO NOT IDENTIFY ALL RISKS THAT WE FACE; OUR OPERATIONS COULD ALSO BE AFFECTED BY FACTORS THAT ARE NOT PRESENTLY KNOWN TO US OR THAT WE CURRENTLY CONSIDER TO BE IMMATERIAL TO OUR OPERATIONS. DUE TO RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES, KNOWN AND UNKNOWN, OUR PAST FINANCIAL RESULTS MAY NOT BE A RELIABLE INDICATOR OF FUTURE PERFORMANCE, AND HISTORICAL TRENDS SHOULD NOT BE USED TO ANTICIPATE RESULTS OR TRENDS IN FUTURE PERIODS. REFER ALSO TO THE OTHER INFORMATION SET FORTH IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K, INCLUDING "MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS" AND OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND THE RELATED NOTES.

CHANGES IN PRODUCT DEMAND CAN ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS.

DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS IS VARIABLE AND HARD TO PREDICT.

CHANGES

IN THE DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS MAY REDUCE OUR REVENUE, INCREASE OUR COSTS, LOWER OUR GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE, OR REQUIRE US TO WRITE DOWN THE VALUE OF OUR ASSETS. OUR PLATFORM PRODUCTS ARE USED ACROSS DIFFERENT MARKET SEGMENTS, AND DEMAND FOR OUR PLATFORMS MAY VARY WITHIN OR AMONG OUR CLIENT COMPUTING, DATA CENTER, INTERNET OF THINGS, AND OTHER MARKET SEGMENTS. IT IS DIFFICULT TO ANTICIPATE THE IMPACT OF THESE CHANGES, AS DEMAND MAY INCREASE IN ONE OR MORE MARKET SEGMENTS WHILE DECREASING IN OTHERS. IMPORTANT FACTORS THAT COULD LEAD TO VARIATION IN THE DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS INCLUDE CHANGES IN.

•

BUSINESS CONDITIONS, INCLUDING DOWNTURNS IN THE COMPUTING INDUSTRY, OR IN THE GLOBAL OR REGIONAL ECONOMIES;

•

CONSUMER CONFIDENCE OR INCOME LEVELS CAUSED BY CHANGES IN MARKET CONDITIONS, INCLUDING CHANGES IN GOVERNMENT BORROWING, TAXATION, OR SPENDING POLICIES; THE CREDIT MARKET; OR EXPECTED INFLATION, EMPLOYMENT, AND ENERGY OR OTHER COMMODITY PRICES;

•

THE LEVEL OF OUR CUSTOMERS’ INVENTORIES;

•

COMPETITIVE AND PRICING PRESSURES, INCLUDING ACTIONS TAKEN BY COMPETITORS;

•

CUSTOMER PRODUCT NEEDS;

•

MARKET ACCEPTANCE AND INDUSTRY SUPPORT OF OUR NEW AND MATURING PRODUCTS; AND

•

THE TECHNOLOGY SUPPLY CHAIN, INCLUDING SUPPLY CONSTRAINTS CAUSED BY NATURAL DISASTERS OR OTHER EVENTS.

WE FACE SIGNIFICANT COMPETITION.

THE

INDUSTRY IN WHICH WE OPERATE IS HIGHLY COMPETITIVE AND SUBJECT TO RAPID TECHNOLOGICAL AND MARKET DEVELOPMENTS, CHANGES IN INDUSTRY STANDARDS, CHANGES IN CUSTOMER NEEDS, AND FREQUENT PRODUCT INTRODUCTIONS AND IMPROVEMENTS. IF WE DO NOT ANTICIPATE AND RESPOND TO THESE DEVELOPMENTS, OUR COMPETITIVE POSITION MAY WEAKEN, AND OUR PRODUCTS OR TECHNOLOGIES MIGHT BE UNCOMPETITIVE OR OBSOLETE. ADDITIONALLY, A NUMBER OF BUSINESS COMBINATIONS, INCLUDING MERGERS, ASSET ACQUISITIONS AND STRATEGIC PARTNERSHIPS, IN THE SEMICONDUCTOR INDUSTRY HAVE OCCURRED OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS, AND MORE COULD OCCUR IN THE FUTURE. CONSOLIDATION IN THE INDUSTRY COULD LEAD TO FEWER CUSTOMERS, PARTNERS OR SUPPLIERS, ANY OF WHICH COULD NEGATIVELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS.

IN RECENT YEARS, OUR BUSINESS FOCUS HAS EXPANDED AND NOW INCLUDES THE DESIGN AND PRODUCTION OF PLATFORMS AND OTHER PRODUCTS FOR THE DATA CENTER, INTERNET OF THINGS, AND MEMORY MARKET SEGMENTS, INCLUDING FPGA PRODUCTS, CONNECTIVITY PRODUCTS, AND A NUMBER OF OTHER PRODUCTS AND SERVICES FOR A WIDE RANGE OF CONNECTED DEVICES. AS A RESULT, WE FACE NEW SOURCES OF COMPETITION, INCLUDING, IN CERTAIN OF THESE MARKET SEGMENTS, FROM INCUMBENT COMPETITORS WITH ESTABLISHED CUSTOMER BASES AND GREATER BRAND RECOGNITION. TO BE SUCCESSFUL, WE NEED TO CULTIVATE NEW INDUSTRY RELATIONSHIPS WITH CUSTOMERS AND PARTNERS IN THESE MARKET SEGMENTS. IN ADDITION, WE MUST CONTINUALLY IMPROVE THE COST, INTEGRATION, AND ENERGY EFFICIENCY OF OUR PRODUCTS, AS WELL AS EXPAND OUR SOFTWARE CAPABILITIES TO PROVIDE CUSTOMERS WITH COMPREHENSIVE COMPUTING SOLUTIONS. DESPITE OUR ONGOING EFFORTS, THERE IS NO GUARANTEE THAT WE WILL ACHIEVE OR MAINTAIN CONSUMER AND MARKET DEMAND OR ACCEPTANCE FOR OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES IN THESE VARIOUS MARKET SEGMENTS.

15

TABLE OF CONTENTS

TO COMPETE SUCCESSFULLY, WE MUST MAINTAIN A SUCCESSFUL R&D EFFORT, DEVELOP NEW PRODUCTS AND PRODUCTION PROCESSES, AND IMPROVE OUR EXISTING PRODUCTS AND PROCESSES AHEAD OF COMPETITORS. FOR EXAMPLE, WE INVEST SUBSTANTIALLY IN OUR NETWORK OF MANUFACTURING AND ASSEMBLY AND TEST FACILITIES, INCLUDING THE CONSTRUCTION OF NEW FABRICATION FACILITIES TO SUPPORT SMALLER TRANSISTOR GEOMETRIES AND LARGER WAFERS. OUR R&D EFFORTS ARE CRITICAL TO OUR SUCCESS AND ARE AIMED AT SOLVING COMPLEX PROBLEMS, AND WE DO NOT EXPECT ALL OF OUR PROJECTS TO BE SUCCESSFUL. WE MAY BE UNABLE TO DEVELOP AND MARKET NEW PRODUCTS SUCCESSFULLY, AND THE PRODUCTS WE INVEST IN AND DEVELOP MAY NOT BE WELL-RECEIVED BY CUSTOMERS. OUR R&D INVESTMENTS MAY NOT GENERATE SIGNIFICANT OPERATING INCOME OR CONTRIBUTE TO OUR FUTURE OPERATING RESULTS FOR SEVERAL YEARS, AND SUCH CONTRIBUTIONS MAY NOT MEET OUR EXPECTATIONS OR EVEN COVER THE COSTS OF SUCH INVESTMENTS. ADDITIONALLY, THE PRODUCTS AND TECHNOLOGIES OFFERED BY OTHERS MAY AFFECT DEMAND FOR, OR PRICING OF, OUR PRODUCTS.

IF WE ARE NOT ABLE TO COMPETE EFFECTIVELY, OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS WILL BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED, INCLUDING INCREASED COSTS AND REDUCED REVENUE AND GROSS MARGIN, AND WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO ACCELERATE THE WRITE-DOWN OF THE VALUE OF CERTAIN ASSETS.

CHANGES IN THE MIX OF PRODUCTS SOLD MAY HARM OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS.

OUR PRICING AND MARGINS VARY ACROSS OUR PRODUCTS AND MARKET SEGMENTS DUE TO DIFFERENCES IN PRODUCT FEATURES OR MANUFACTURING COSTS. FOR EXAMPLE, OUR PLATFORM PRODUCT OFFERINGS RANGE FROM LOWER-PRICED AND ENTRY-LEVEL PLATFORMS, SUCH AS THOSE BASED ON INTEL QUARK OR INTEL ATOM PROCESSORS, TO HIGHER-END PLATFORMS BASED ON INTEL XEON PROCESSORS. IF DEMAND SHIFTS FROM OUR HIGHER-PRICED TO LOWER-PRICED PLATFORMS IN ANY OF OUR MARKET SEGMENTS, OUR GROSS MARGIN AND REVENUE WOULD DECREASE. IN ADDITION, WHEN PRODUCTS ARE INTRODUCED, THEY TEND TO HAVE HIGHER COSTS BECAUSE OF INITIAL DEVELOPMENT COSTS AND LOWER PRODUCTION VOLUMES RELATIVE TO THE PREVIOUS PRODUCT GENERATION, WHICH CAN IMPACT GROSS MARGIN.

WE OPERATE GLOBALLY AND ARE SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT RISKS IN MANY JURISDICTIONS.

GLOBAL OR REGIONAL CONDITIONS MAY HARM OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS.

WE HAVE MANUFACTURING, ASSEMBLY AND TEST, R&D, SALES, AND OTHER OPERATIONS IN MANY COUNTRIES, AND SOME OF OUR BUSINESS ACTIVITIES MAY BE CONCENTRATED IN ONE OR MORE GEOGRAPHIC AREAS. MOREOVER, SALES OUTSIDE THE U.S. ACCOUNTED FOR APPROXIMATELY

78%

OF OUR REVENUE FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED

DECEMBER 31, 2016

. AS A RESULT, OUR OPERATIONS AND OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS, INCLUDING OUR ABILITY TO MANUFACTURE, ASSEMBLE AND TEST, DESIGN, DEVELOP, OR SELL PRODUCTS, MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY A NUMBER OF FACTORS OUTSIDE OF OUR CONTROL, INCLUDING.

•

GLOBAL AND LOCAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS;

•

GEOPOLITICAL AND SECURITY ISSUES, SUCH AS ARMED CONFLICT AND CIVIL OR MILITARY UNREST, CRIME, POLITICAL INSTABILITY, HUMAN RIGHTS CONCERNS, AND TERRORIST ACTIVITY;

•

NATURAL DISASTERS, PUBLIC HEALTH ISSUES, AND OTHER CATASTROPHIC EVENTS;

•

INEFFICIENT INFRASTRUCTURE AND OTHER DISRUPTIONS, SUCH AS SUPPLY CHAIN INTERRUPTIONS AND LARGE-SCALE OUTAGES OR UNRELIABLE PROVISION OF SERVICES FROM UTILITIES, TRANSPORTATION, DATA HOSTING, OR TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROVIDERS;

•

GOVERNMENT RESTRICTIONS ON, OR NATIONALIZATION OF OUR OPERATIONS IN ANY COUNTRY, OR RESTRICTIONS ON OUR ABILITY TO REPATRIATE EARNINGS FROM A PARTICULAR COUNTRY;

•

DIFFERING EMPLOYMENT PRACTICES AND LABOR ISSUES;

•

FORMAL OR INFORMAL IMPOSITION OF NEW OR REVISED EXPORT AND/OR IMPORT AND DOING-BUSINESS REGULATIONS, INCLUDING TRADE SANCTIONS AND TARIFFS, WHICH COULD BE CHANGED WITHOUT NOTICE;

•

INEFFECTIVE LEGAL PROTECTION OF OUR IP RIGHTS IN CERTAIN COUNTRIES;

•

LOCAL BUSINESS AND CULTURAL FACTORS THAT DIFFER FROM OUR NORMAL STANDARDS AND PRACTICES; AND

•

INCREASED UNCERTAINTY REGARDING SOCIAL, POLITICAL, IMMIGRATION AND TRADE POLICIES IN THE U.S. AND ABROAD, SUCH AS RECENT U.S. LEGISLATION AND POLICIES AND THE UNITED KINGDOM'S REFERENDUM TO WITHDRAW FROM THE EUROPEAN UNION ("BREXIT").

WE ARE SUBJECT TO LAWS AND REGULATIONS WORLDWIDE, WHICH MAY DIFFER AMONG JURISDICTIONS, AFFECTING OUR OPERATIONS IN AREAS INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO: IP OWNERSHIP AND INFRINGEMENT; TAX; IMPORT AND EXPORT REQUIREMENTS; ANTI-CORRUPTION; FOREIGN EXCHANGE CONTROLS AND CASH REPATRIATION RESTRICTIONS; DATA PRIVACY REQUIREMENTS; ANTI-COMPETITION; ADVERTISING; EMPLOYMENT; PRODUCT REGULATIONS; ENVIRONMENT, HEALTH, AND SAFETY REQUIREMENTS; AND CONSUMER LAWS. COMPLIANCE WITH SUCH REQUIREMENTS MAY BE ONEROUS AND EXPENSIVE, AND MAY OTHERWISE IMPACT OUR BUSINESS OPERATIONS NEGATIVELY. ALTHOUGH WE HAVE POLICIES, CONTROLS, AND PROCEDURES DESIGNED TO HELP ENSURE COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE LAWS, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT OUR EMPLOYEES, CONTRACTORS, SUPPLIERS, AND/OR AGENTS WILL NOT VIOLATE SUCH LAWS OR OUR POLICIES. VIOLATIONS OF THESE LAWS AND REGULATIONS COULD RESULT IN FINES; CRIMINAL SANCTIONS AGAINST US, OUR OFFICERS, OR OUR EMPLOYEES; PROHIBITIONS ON THE CONDUCT OF OUR BUSINESS; AND DAMAGE TO OUR REPUTATION.

WE MAY BE AFFECTED BY FLUCTUATIONS IN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES.

WE ARE POTENTIALLY EXPOSED TO ADVERSE AS WELL AS BENEFICIAL MOVEMENTS IN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES. ALTHOUGH MOST OF OUR SALES OCCUR IN U.S. DOLLARS, EXPENSES MAY BE PAID IN LOCAL CURRENCIES. AN INCREASE IN THE VALUE OF THE DOLLAR COULD INCREASE THE REAL COST TO OUR CUSTOMERS OF OUR PRODUCTS IN THOSE MARKETS OUTSIDE THE U.S. WHERE WE SELL IN DOLLARS, AND A WEAKENED DOLLAR COULD INCREASE THE COST OF EXPENSES SUCH AS PAYROLL, UTILITIES, TAX, AND MARKETING EXPENSES, AS WELL AS OVERSEAS CAPITAL EXPENDITURES. WE ALSO CONDUCT CERTAIN INVESTING AND FINANCING ACTIVITIES IN LOCAL CURRENCIES. OUR HEDGING PROGRAMS REDUCE, BUT DO NOT ELIMINATE, THE IMPACT OF CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE MOVEMENTS; THEREFORE, CHANGES IN EXCHANGE RATES COULD HARM OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

CATASTROPHIC EVENTS OR GEOPOLITICAL CONDITIONS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL RESULTS.

OUR OPERATIONS OR SYSTEMS COULD BE DISRUPTED BY NATURAL DISASTERS; INDUSTRIAL ACCIDENTS; GEOPOLITICAL CONDITIONS; TERRORIST ACTIVITY; PUBLIC HEALTH ISSUES; CYBERSECURITY INCIDENTS; INTERRUPTIONS OF SERVICE FROM UTILITIES, TRANSPORTATION, OR TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROVIDERS; OR OTHER CATASTROPHIC EVENTS. SUCH EVENTS COULD MAKE IT DIFFICULT OR IMPOSSIBLE TO MANUFACTURE OR DELIVER PRODUCTS TO OUR CUSTOMERS, RECEIVE PRODUCTION MATERIALS FROM OUR SUPPLIERS, OR PERFORM CRITICAL FUNCTIONS, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR REVENUE AND REQUIRE SIGNIFICANT RECOVERY TIME AND EXPENDITURES TO RESUME OPERATIONS. WHILE WE MAINTAIN BUSINESS RECOVERY PLANS THAT ARE INTENDED TO ENABLE US TO RECOVER FROM NATURAL DISASTERS OR OTHER EVENTS THAT CAN BE DISRUPTIVE TO OUR BUSINESS, SOME OF OUR SYSTEMS ARE NOT FULLY REDUNDANT AND WE CANNOT BE SURE THAT OUR PLANS WILL FULLY PROTECT US FROM ALL SUCH DISRUPTIONS.

WE MAINTAIN A PROGRAM OF INSURANCE COVERAGE FOR A VARIETY OF PROPERTY, CASUALTY, AND OTHER RISKS. THE TYPES AND AMOUNTS OF INSURANCE WE OBTAIN VARY DEPENDING ON AVAILABILITY, COST, AND DECISIONS WITH RESPECT TO RISK RETENTION. SOME OF OUR POLICIES HAVE LARGE DEDUCTIBLES AND BROAD EXCLUSIONS. IN ADDITION, ONE OR MORE OF OUR INSURANCE PROVIDERS MAY BE UNABLE OR UNWILLING TO PAY A CLAIM. LOSSES NOT COVERED BY INSURANCE MAY BE LARGE, WHICH COULD HARM OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

WE ARE VULNERABLE TO PRODUCT AND MANUFACTURING-RELATED RISKS.

DUE TO THE VARIABILITY IN DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS AND THE COMPLEXITY OF OUR MANUFACTURING OPERATIONS, WE MAY BE UNABLE TO TIMELY RESPOND TO FLUCTUATIONS IN DEMAND.

OUR OPERATIONS HAVE HIGH COSTS THAT ARE EITHER FIXED OR DIFFICULT TO REDUCE IN THE SHORT TERM, INCLUDING OUR COSTS RELATED TO MANUFACTURING, SUCH AS FACILITY CONSTRUCTION AND EQUIPMENT, R&D, AND THE EMPLOYMENT AND TRAINING OF A HIGHLY SKILLED WORKFORCE. IF PRODUCT DEMAND DECREASES OR WE FAIL TO FORECAST DEMAND ACCURATELY, WE COULD BE REQUIRED TO WRITE OFF INVENTORY OR RECORD EXCESS CAPACITY CHARGES, WHICH WOULD LOWER OUR GROSS MARGIN. OUR MANUFACTURING OR ASSEMBLY AND TEST CAPACITY COULD BE UNDERUTILIZED, AND WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO WRITE DOWN OUR LONG-LIVED ASSETS, WHICH WOULD INCREASE OUR EXPENSES. FACTORY-PLANNING DECISIONS MAY SHORTEN THE USEFUL LIVES OF FACILITIES AND EQUIPMENT AND CAUSE US TO ACCELERATE DEPRECIATION.

CONVERSELY, IF PRODUCT DEMAND INCREASES, WE MAY BE UNABLE TO ADD CAPACITY FAST ENOUGH TO MEET MARKET DEMAND. OUR REVENUE AND GROSS MARGIN CAN ALSO BE AFFECTED BY THE TIMING OF OUR PRODUCT INTRODUCTIONS AND RELATED EXPENSES, INCLUDING MARKETING EXPENSES.

WE ARE SUBJECT TO RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE DEVELOPMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION OF NEW MANUFACTURING PROCESS TECHNOLOGY.

WE MAY NOT BE SUCCESSFUL OR EFFICIENT IN DEVELOPING OR IMPLEMENTING NEW PRODUCTION PROCESSES. PRODUCTION OF INTEGRATED CIRCUITS IS A COMPLEX PROCESS. WE ARE CONTINUALLY ENGAGED IN THE TRANSITION FROM OUR EXISTING PROCESS TO THE NEXT-GENERATION PROCESS TECHNOLOGY. THIS CONSISTENT INNOVATION INVOLVES SIGNIFICANT EXPENSE AND CARRIES INHERENT RISKS, INCLUDING DIFFICULTIES IN DESIGNING AND DEVELOPING NEXT-GENERATION PROCESS TECHNOLOGIES, DEVELOPMENT AND PRODUCTION TIMING DELAYS, LOWER THAN ANTICIPATED MANUFACTURING YIELDS, AND PRODUCT DEFECTS AND ERRATA. DISRUPTIONS IN THE PRODUCTION PROCESS CAN ALSO RESULT FROM ERRORS, DEFECTS IN MATERIALS, DELAYS IN OBTAINING OR REVISING OPERATING PERMITS AND LICENSES, INTERRUPTION IN OUR SUPPLY OF MATERIALS OR RESOURCES, AND DISRUPTIONS AT OUR FABRICATION AND ASSEMBLY AND TEST FACILITIES DUE TO ACCIDENTS, MAINTENANCE ISSUES, OR UNSAFE WORKING CONDITIONS—ALL OF WHICH COULD AFFECT THE TIMING OF PRODUCTION RAMPS AND YIELDS. PRODUCTION ISSUES CAN LEAD TO INCREASED COSTS AND MAY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO MEET PRODUCT DEMAND, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR BUSINESS AND THE RESULTS FROM OPERATIONS.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

WE FACE SUPPLY CHAIN RISKS.

THOUSANDS OF SUPPLIERS PROVIDE MATERIALS AND EQUIPMENT THAT WE USE IN PRODUCTION AND OTHER ASPECTS OF OUR BUSINESS. WHERE POSSIBLE, WE SEEK TO HAVE SEVERAL SOURCES OF SUPPLY FOR ALL OF THOSE MATERIALS. HOWEVER, FOR CERTAIN MATERIALS, WE MAY RELY ON A SINGLE OR A LIMITED NUMBER OF SUPPLIERS, OR UPON SUPPLIERS IN A SINGLE LOCATION. IN ADDITION, CONSOLIDATION AMONG SUPPLIERS COULD IMPACT THE NATURE, QUALITY, AVAILABILITY, AND PRICING OF THE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES AVAILABLE TO US. THE INABILITY OF SUPPLIERS TO DELIVER ADEQUATE SUPPLIES OF PRODUCTION MATERIALS OR OTHER SUPPLIES COULD DISRUPT OUR PRODUCTION PROCESSES OR MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR US TO IMPLEMENT OUR BUSINESS STRATEGY. PRODUCTION COULD BE DISRUPTED BY THE UNAVAILABILITY OF RESOURCES USED IN PRODUCTION, SUCH AS WATER, SILICON, ELECTRICITY, GASES, AND OTHER MATERIALS. THE UNAVAILABILITY OR REDUCED AVAILABILITY OF MATERIALS OR RESOURCES MAY REQUIRE US TO REDUCE PRODUCTION OR INCUR ADDITIONAL COSTS, WHICH COULD HARM OUR BUSINESS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. OUR MANUFACTURING OPERATIONS AND ABILITY TO MEET PRODUCT DEMAND MAY ALSO BE IMPACTED BY IP OR OTHER LITIGATION BETWEEN OUR SUPPLIERS, WHERE AN INJUNCTION AGAINST INTEL OR A SUPPLIER COULD INTERRUPT THE AVAILABILITY OF GOODS OR SERVICES SUPPLIED TO INTEL BY OTHERS.

WE ALSO RELY ON THIRD-PARTY PROVIDERS TO MANUFACTURE AND ASSEMBLE AND TEST CERTAIN COMPONENTS OR PRODUCTS, PARTICULARLY THOSE RELATED TO NETWORKING, MOBILE AND COMMUNICATIONS, PROGRAMMABLE SEMICONDUCTOR SOLUTIONS, AND NAND FLASH MEMORY. IF ANY OF THESE THIRD PARTIES ARE UNABLE TO PERFORM THESE SERVICES ON A TIMELY OR COST-EFFECTIVE BASIS, WE MAY ENCOUNTER SUPPLY DELAYS OR DISRUPTIONS THAT COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS.

IN ADDITION, THERE ARE REGULATORY AND OTHER REQUIREMENTS, RESTRICTIONS, AND REQUESTS FROM VARIOUS CONSTITUENCIES REGARDING SOURCING PRACTICES AND SUPPLIER CONDUCT, WITH A TREND TOWARD EXPANDING THE SCOPE OF MATERIALS AND LOCATIONS WHERE MATERIALS ORIGINATE, REGULATING SUPPLIER BEHAVIORS, AND INCREASING THE REQUIRED DISCLOSURES REGARDING SUCH MATTERS BY PUBLIC COMPANIES. INCREASED REGULATION AND PUBLIC PRESSURE IN THIS AREA WOULD CAUSE OUR COMPLIANCE COSTS TO INCREASE AND COULD NEGATIVELY AFFECT OUR REPUTATION GIVEN THAT WE USE MANY MATERIALS IN THE MANUFACTURING OF OUR PRODUCTS AND RELY ON MANY SUPPLIERS TO PROVIDE THESE MATERIALS, BUT DO NOT DIRECTLY CONTROL THEIR PROCUREMENT OR EMPLOYMENT PRACTICES.

WE ARE SUBJECT TO THE RISKS OF PRODUCT DEFECTS, ERRATA OR OTHER PRODUCT ISSUES.

PRODUCT DEFECTS AND ERRATA (DEVIATIONS FROM PUBLISHED SPECIFICATIONS) MAY RESULT FROM PROBLEMS IN OUR PRODUCT DESIGN OR OUR MANUFACTURING AND ASSEMBLY AND TEST PROCESSES. COMPONENTS AND PRODUCTS WE PURCHASE OR LICENSE FROM THIRD-PARTY SUPPLIERS, OR ATTAIN THROUGH ACQUISITIONS, MAY ALSO CONTAIN DEFECTS. WE COULD FACE RISKS IF PRODUCTS THAT WE DESIGN, MANUFACTURE OR SELL, OR THAT INCLUDE OUR TECHNOLOGY, CAUSE PERSONAL INJURY OR PROPERTY DAMAGE, EVEN WHERE THE CAUSE IS UNRELATED TO PRODUCT DEFECTS OR ERRATA. THESE RISKS MAY INCREASE AS OUR PRODUCTS ARE INTRODUCED INTO NEW DEVICES, MARKETS, TECHNOLOGIES, OR APPLICATIONS THROUGH THE INTERNET OF THINGS, INCLUDING WEARABLES, DRONES AND TRANSPORTATION, AND INDUSTRIAL AND CONSUMER USES. COSTS FROM DEFECTS, ERRATA, OR OTHER PRODUCT ISSUES COULD INCLUDE.

•

WRITING OFF SOME OR ALL OF THE VALUE OF INVENTORY;

•

RECALLING PRODUCTS THAT HAVE BEEN SHIPPED;

•

PROVIDING PRODUCT REPLACEMENTS OR MODIFICATIONS;

•

REIMBURSING CUSTOMERS FOR CERTAIN COSTS THEY INCUR;

•

DEFENDING AGAINST LITIGATION AND/OR PAYING RESULTING DAMAGES; AND

•

PAYING FINES IMPOSED BY REGULATORY AGENCIES.

THESE COSTS COULD BE LARGE AND MAY INCREASE EXPENSES AND LOWER GROSS MARGIN, AND RESULT IN DELAY OR LOSS OF REVENUE. ANY PRODUCT DEFECTS, ERRATA, OR OTHER ISSUES COULD ALSO DAMAGE OUR REPUTATION, NEGATIVELY AFFECT PRODUCT DEMAND, DELAY PRODUCT RELEASES, OR RESULT IN LEGAL LIABILITY. THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF PRODUCT DEFECTS OR ERRATA COULD CAUSE CUSTOMERS TO PURCHASE PRODUCTS FROM COMPETITORS AS A RESULT OF POSSIBLE SHORTAGES OF OUR COMPONENTS OR FOR OTHER REASONS. ANY OF THESE OCCURRENCES COULD HARM OUR BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL RESULTS. IN ADDITION, ALTHOUGH WE MAINTAIN LIABILITY INSURANCE, OUR COVERAGE HAS CERTAIN EXCLUSIONS AND/OR MAY NOT ADEQUATELY COVER LIABILITIES INCURRED. OUR INSURANCE PROVIDERS MAY BE UNABLE OR UNWILLING TO PAY A CLAIM, AND LOSSES NOT COVERED BY INSURANCE COULD BE LARGE, WHICH COULD HARM OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION.

WE ARE SUBJECT TO RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS.

THE MANUFACTURING AND ASSEMBLY AND TEST OF OUR PRODUCTS REQUIRE THE USE OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS THAT ARE SUBJECT TO A BROAD ARRAY OF ENVIRONMENTAL, HEALTH, AND SAFETY LAWS AND REGULATIONS. OUR FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH THESE LAWS OR REGULATIONS COULD RESULT IN.

•

REGULATORY PENALTIES, FINES, AND LEGAL LIABILITIES;

•

SUSPENSION OF PRODUCTION;

•

ALTERATION OF OUR MANUFACTURING AND ASSEMBLY AND TEST PROCESSES;

•

REPUTATIONAL CHALLENGES; AND

•

RESTRICTIONS ON OUR OPERATIONS OR SALES.

18

TABLE OF CONTENTS

OUR FAILURE TO MANAGE THE USE, TRANSPORTATION, EMISSIONS, DISCHARGE, STORAGE, RECYCLING, OR DISPOSAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS COULD LEAD TO INCREASED COSTS OR FUTURE LIABILITIES. OUR ABILITY TO EXPAND OR MODIFY OUR MANUFACTURING CAPABILITY IN THE FUTURE MAY BE IMPEDED BY ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS, SUCH AS AIR QUALITY AND WASTEWATER REQUIREMENTS. ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS COULD ALSO REQUIRE US TO ACQUIRE POLLUTION ABATEMENT OR REMEDIATION EQUIPMENT, MODIFY PRODUCT DESIGNS, OR INCUR OTHER EXPENSES. MANY NEW MATERIALS THAT WE ARE EVALUATING FOR USE IN OUR OPERATIONS MAY BE SUBJECT TO REGULATION UNDER ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS. THESE RESTRICTIONS COULD HARM OUR BUSINESS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS BY INCREASING OUR EXPENSES OR REQUIRING US TO ALTER MANUFACTURING AND ASSEMBLY AND TEST PROCESSES.

CLIMATE CHANGE MAY ALSO POSE REGULATORY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RISKS THAT COULD HARM OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND AFFECT THE WAY WE CONDUCT BUSINESS. FOR EXAMPLE, CLIMATE CHANGE REGULATION COULD RESULT IN INCREASED MANUFACTURING COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH AIR POLLUTION CONTROL REQUIREMENTS, AND INCREASED OR NEW MONITORING, RECORDKEEPING, AND REPORTING OF GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS. WE ALSO SEE THE POTENTIAL FOR HIGHER ENERGY COSTS DRIVEN BY CLIMATE CHANGE REGULATIONS IF, FOR EXAMPLE, UTILITY COMPANIES PASS ON THEIR COSTS TO THEIR CUSTOMERS. FURTHERMORE, MANY OF OUR OPERATIONS ARE LOCATED IN SEMI-ARID REGIONS THAT MAY BECOME INCREASINGLY VULNERABLE TO PROLONGED DROUGHTS DUE TO CLIMATE CHANGE. OUR FABRICATION FACILITIES REQUIRE SIGNIFICANT WATER USE AND, WHILE WE RECYCLE AND REUSE A PORTION OF THE WATER USED, WE MAY HAVE DIFFICULTIES OBTAINING SUFFICIENT WATER TO FULFILL OUR OPERATIONAL NEEDS DUE THE LACK OF AVAILABLE INFRASTRUCTURE.

WE ARE SUBJECT TO IP RISKS AND RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH LITIGATION AND REGULATORY PROCEEDINGS.

WE MAY BE UNABLE TO ENFORCE OR PROTECT OUR IP RIGHTS.

WE REGARD OUR PATENTS, COPYRIGHTS, TRADE SECRETS, AND OTHER IP RIGHTS AS IMPORTANT TO THE SUCCESS OF OUR BUSINESS. WE RELY ON IP LAW AS WELL AS CONFIDENTIALITY AND LICENSING AGREEMENTS WITH OUR CUSTOMERS, EMPLOYEES, TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT PARTNERS, AND OTHERS TO PROTECT OUR IP RIGHTS. OUR ABILITY TO ENFORCE THESE RIGHTS IS SUBJECT TO GENERAL LITIGATION RISKS, AS WELL AS UNCERTAINTY AS TO THE ENFORCEABILITY OF OUR IP RIGHTS IN VARIOUS COUNTRIES. WHEN WE SEEK TO ENFORCE OUR RIGHTS, WE MAY BE SUBJECT TO CLAIMS THAT THE IP RIGHTS ARE INVALID, NOT ENFORCEABLE, OR LICENSED TO THE OPPOSING PARTY. OUR ASSERTION OF IP RIGHTS MAY RESULT IN THE OTHER PARTY SEEKING TO ASSERT CLAIMS AGAINST US, WHICH COULD HARM OUR BUSINESS. GOVERNMENTS MAY ADOPT REGULATIONS—AND GOVERNMENTS OR COURTS MAY RENDER DECISIONS—REQUIRING COMPULSORY LICENSING OF IP RIGHTS, OR GOVERNMENTS MAY REQUIRE PRODUCTS TO MEET STANDARDS THAT SERVE TO FAVOR LOCAL COMPANIES. OUR INABILITY TO ENFORCE OUR IP RIGHTS UNDER ANY OF THESE CIRCUMSTANCES MAY HARM OUR COMPETITIVE POSITION AND BUSINESS. IN ADDITION, THE THEFT OR UNAUTHORIZED USE OR PUBLICATION OF OUR TRADE SECRETS AND OTHER CONFIDENTIAL BUSINESS INFORMATION COULD HARM OUR COMPETITIVE POSITION AND REDUCE ACCEPTANCE OF OUR PRODUCTS; AS A RESULT, THE VALUE OF OUR INVESTMENT IN R&D, PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT, AND MARKETING COULD BE REDUCED.

OUR LICENSES WITH OTHER COMPANIES AND PARTICIPATION IN INDUSTRY INITIATIVES MAY ALLOW COMPETITORS TO USE OUR PATENT RIGHTS.

COMPANIES IN OUR INDUSTRY OFTEN BILATERALLY LICENSE PATENTS BETWEEN EACH OTHER TO SETTLE DISPUTES OR AS PART OF BUSINESS AGREEMENTS. OUR COMPETITORS MAY HAVE LICENSES TO OUR PATENTS, AND UNDER CURRENT CASE LAW, SOME OF THE LICENSES MAY EXHAUST OUR PATENT RIGHTS AS TO LICENSED PRODUCT SALES UNDER SOME CIRCUMSTANCES. OUR PARTICIPATION IN INDUSTRY STANDARDS ORGANIZATIONS OR WITH OTHER INDUSTRY INITIATIVES MAY REQUIRE US TO LICENSE OUR PATENTS TO COMPANIES THAT ADOPT INDUSTRY-STANDARD SPECIFICATIONS. DEPENDING ON THE RULES OF THE ORGANIZATION, WE MIGHT HAVE TO GRANT THESE LICENSES TO OUR PATENTS FOR LITTLE OR NO COST, AND AS A RESULT, WE MAY BE UNABLE TO ENFORCE CERTAIN PATENTS AGAINST OTHERS, OUR COSTS OF ENFORCING OUR LICENSES OR PROTECTING OUR PATENTS MAY INCREASE, AND THE VALUE OF OUR IP RIGHTS MAY BE IMPAIRED.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THIRD PARTIES MAY ASSERT CLAIMS BASED ON IP RIGHTS AGAINST US OR OUR PRODUCTS, WHICH COULD HARM OUR BUSINESS.

WE MAY FACE CLAIMS BASED ON IP RIGHTS FROM INDIVIDUALS AND COMPANIES, INCLUDING THOSE WHO HAVE ACQUIRED PATENT PORTFOLIOS TO ASSERT CLAIMS AGAINST OTHER COMPANIES. WE ARE NORMALLY ENGAGED IN A NUMBER OF LITIGATION MATTERS INVOLVING IP RIGHTS. CLAIMS THAT OUR PRODUCTS OR PROCESSES INFRINGE THE IP RIGHTS OF OTHERS, WHETHER OR NOT MERITORIOUS, COULD CAUSE US TO INCUR LARGE COSTS TO RESPOND TO, DEFEND, AND RESOLVE, AND THEY MAY DIVERT THE EFFORTS AND ATTENTION OF MANAGEMENT AND TECHNICAL PERSONNEL. IN ADDITION, WE MAY FACE CLAIMS BASED ON THE THEFT OR UNAUTHORIZED USE OR DISCLOSURE OF THIRD-PARTY TRADE SECRETS AND OTHER CONFIDENTIAL BUSINESS INFORMATION OR END-USER DATA THAT WE OBTAIN IN CONDUCTING OUR BUSINESS. ANY SUCH INCIDENTS AND CLAIMS COULD SEVERELY DISRUPT OUR BUSINESS, AND WE COULD SUFFER LOSSES, INCLUDING THE COST OF PRODUCT RECALLS AND RETURNS, AND REPUTATIONAL HARM. FURTHERMORE, WE HAVE AGREED TO INDEMNIFY CUSTOMERS FOR CERTAIN IP RIGHTS CLAIMS AGAINST THEM. AS A RESULT OF IP RIGHTS CLAIMS, WE COULD.

•

PAY MONETARY DAMAGES, INCLUDING PAYMENTS TO SATISFY INDEMNIFICATION OBLIGATIONS;

•

STOP MANUFACTURING, USING, SELLING, OFFERING TO SELL, OR IMPORTING PRODUCTS OR TECHNOLOGY SUBJECT TO CLAIMS;

•

DEVELOP OTHER PRODUCTS OR TECHNOLOGY NOT SUBJECT TO CLAIMS, WHICH COULD BE TIME-CONSUMING OR COSTLY; AND/OR

•

ENTER INTO SETTLEMENT AND LICENSE AGREEMENTS, WHICH AGREEMENTS MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE ON COMMERCIALLY REASONABLE TERMS.

THESE IP RIGHTS CLAIMS COULD HARM OUR COMPETITIVE POSITION, RESULT IN EXPENSES, OR REQUIRE US TO IMPAIR OUR ASSETS. IF WE ALTER OR STOP PRODUCTION OF AFFECTED ITEMS, OUR REVENUE COULD BE HARMED.

WE RELY ON ACCESS TO THIRD-PARTY IP, WHICH MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE TO US ON COMMERCIALLY REASONABLE TERMS OR AT ALL.

MANY OF OUR PRODUCTS INCLUDE THIRD-PARTY IP AND/OR IMPLEMENT INDUSTRY STANDARDS, WHICH MAY REQUIRE LICENSES FROM THIRD PARTIES. BASED ON PAST EXPERIENCE AND INDUSTRY PRACTICE, WE BELIEVE SUCH LICENSES GENERALLY CAN BE OBTAINED ON COMMERCIALLY REASONABLE TERMS. HOWEVER, THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT THE NECESSARY LICENSES CAN BE OBTAINED ON ACCEPTABLE TERMS OR AT ALL. FAILURE TO OBTAIN THE RIGHT TO USE THIRD-PARTY IP, OR TO USE SUCH IP ON COMMERCIALLY REASONABLE TERMS, COULD PRECLUDE US FROM SELLING CERTAIN PRODUCTS OR OTHERWISE HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS.

WE ARE SUBJECT TO THE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH LITIGATION AND REGULATORY PROCEEDINGS.

WE MAY FACE LEGAL CLAIMS OR REGULATORY MATTERS INVOLVING STOCKHOLDER, CONSUMER, COMPETITION, AND OTHER ISSUES ON A GLOBAL BASIS. AS DESCRIBED IN "

NOTE 20: COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

" IN PART II, ITEM 8 OF THIS FORM 10-K, WE ARE ENGAGED IN A NUMBER OF LITIGATION AND REGULATORY MATTERS. LITIGATION AND REGULATORY PROCEEDINGS ARE INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN, AND ADVERSE RULINGS COULD OCCUR, INCLUDING MONETARY DAMAGES, OR AN INJUNCTION STOPPING US FROM MANUFACTURING OR SELLING CERTAIN PRODUCTS, ENGAGING IN CERTAIN BUSINESS PRACTICES, OR REQUIRING OTHER REMEDIES, SUCH AS COMPULSORY LICENSING OF PATENTS. AN UNFAVORABLE OUTCOME MAY RESULT IN A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR BUSINESS, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL POSITION, AND OVERALL TRENDS. IN ADDITION, REGARDLESS OF THE OUTCOME, LITIGATION CAN BE COSTLY, TIME-CONSUMING, DISRUPTIVE TO OUR OPERATIONS, AND DISTRACTING TO MANAGEMENT.

WE MUST ATTRACT, RETAIN, AND MOTIVATE KEY EMPLOYEES.

TO BE COMPETITIVE, WE MUST ATTRACT, RETAIN, AND MOTIVATE EXECUTIVES AND OTHER KEY EMPLOYEES. HIRING AND RETAINING QUALIFIED EXECUTIVES, SCIENTISTS, ENGINEERS, TECHNICAL STAFF, AND SALES REPRESENTATIVES ARE CRITICAL TO OUR BUSINESS, AND COMPETITION FOR EXPERIENCED EMPLOYEES CAN BE INTENSE. TO HELP ATTRACT, RETAIN, AND MOTIVATE QUALIFIED EMPLOYEES, WE USE SHARE-BASED AND OTHER PERFORMANCE-BASED INCENTIVE AWARDS SUCH AS RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS (RSUS) AND CASH BONUSES. ALSO KEY TO OUR EMPLOYEE HIRING AND RETENTION IS OUR ABILITY TO BUILD AND MAINTAIN AN INCLUSIVE BUSINESS CULTURE AND BE VIEWED AS AN EMPLOYER OF CHOICE. IF OUR SHARE-BASED OR OTHER COMPENSATION PROGRAMS AND WORKPLACE CULTURE CEASE TO BE VIEWED AS COMPETITIVE, OUR ABILITY TO ATTRACT, RETAIN, AND MOTIVATE EMPLOYEES COULD BE WEAKENED, WHICH COULD HARM OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

WE ARE SUBJECT TO CYBERSECURITY AND PRIVACY RISKS.

THIRD PARTIES ATTEMPT TO GAIN UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS TO OUR NETWORK, PRODUCTS, SERVICES, AND INFRASTRUCTURE.

WE REGULARLY FACE ATTEMPTS BY OTHERS TO GAIN UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS THROUGH THE INTERNET OR TO INTRODUCE MALICIOUS SOFTWARE TO OUR INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY (IT) SYSTEMS. ADDITIONALLY, MALICIOUS HACKERS MAY ATTEMPT TO GAIN UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS AND CORRUPT THE PROCESSES OF HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE PRODUCTS THAT WE MANUFACTURE AND SERVICES WE PROVIDE. DUE TO THE WIDESPREAD USE OF OUR PRODUCTS AND THE HIGH PROFILE OF OUR COMMERCIAL SECURITY PRODUCTS, WE OR OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES ARE A FREQUENT TARGET OF COMPUTER HACKERS AND ORGANIZATIONS THAT INTEND TO SABOTAGE, TAKE CONTROL OF, OR OTHERWISE CORRUPT OUR MANUFACTURING OR OTHER PROCESSES, PRODUCTS, AND SERVICES. WE ARE ALSO A TARGET OF MALICIOUS ATTACKERS WHO ATTEMPT TO GAIN ACCESS TO OUR NETWORK OR DATA CENTERS OR THOSE OF OUR CUSTOMERS OR END USERS; STEAL PROPRIETARY INFORMATION RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS, PRODUCTS, EMPLOYEES, AND CUSTOMERS; OR INTERRUPT OUR SYSTEMS AND SERVICES OR THOSE OF OUR CUSTOMERS OR OTHERS. WE BELIEVE SUCH ATTEMPTS ARE INCREASING IN NUMBER AND IN TECHNICAL SOPHISTICATION. FROM TIME TO TIME, WE ENCOUNTER INTRUSIONS OR UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS TO OUR NETWORK, PRODUCTS, SERVICES, OR INFRASTRUCTURE. TO DATE, NONE HAVE RESULTED IN ANY MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT TO OUR BUSINESS OR OPERATIONS. IN SOME INSTANCES, WE, OUR CUSTOMERS, AND THE USERS OF OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES MIGHT BE UNAWARE OF AN INCIDENT OR ITS MAGNITUDE AND EFFECTS. WHILE WE SEEK TO DETECT AND INVESTIGATE ALL UNAUTHORIZED ATTEMPTS AND ATTACKS AGAINST OUR NETWORK, PRODUCTS, AND SERVICES, AND TO PREVENT THEIR RECURRENCE WHERE PRACTICABLE THROUGH CHANGES TO OUR INTERNAL PROCESSES AND TOOLS AND/OR CHANGES OR PATCHES TO OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, WE REMAIN POTENTIALLY VULNERABLE TO ADDITIONAL KNOWN OR UNKNOWN THREATS. SUCH INCIDENTS, WHETHER SUCCESSFUL OR UNSUCCESSFUL, COULD RESULT IN OUR INCURRING SIGNIFICANT COSTS RELATED TO, FOR EXAMPLE, REBUILDING INTERNAL SYSTEMS, REDUCED INVENTORY VALUE, PROVIDING MODIFICATIONS TO OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, DEFENDING AGAINST LITIGATION, RESPONDING TO REGULATORY INQUIRIES OR ACTIONS, PAYING DAMAGES, OR TAKING OTHER REMEDIAL STEPS WITH RESPECT TO THIRD PARTIES. IN ADDITION, THESE THREATS ARE CONSTANTLY EVOLVING, THEREBY INCREASING THE DIFFICULTY OF SUCCESSFULLY DEFENDING AGAINST THEM OR IMPLEMENTING ADEQUATE PREVENTATIVE MEASURES. PUBLICITY ABOUT VULNERABILITIES AND ATTEMPTED OR SUCCESSFUL INCURSIONS COULD DAMAGE OUR REPUTATION WITH CUSTOMERS OR USERS, AND REDUCE DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES.

WE MAY BE SUBJECT TO THEFT, LOSS, OR MISUSE OF PERSONAL DATA ABOUT OUR EMPLOYEES, CUSTOMERS, OR OTHER THIRD PARTIES, WHICH COULD INCREASE OUR EXPENSES, DAMAGE OUR REPUTATION, OR RESULT IN LEGAL OR REGULATORY PROCEEDINGS.

THE THEFT, LOSS, OR MISUSE OF PERSONAL DATA COLLECTED, USED, STORED, OR TRANSFERRED BY US TO RUN OUR BUSINESS COULD RESULT IN SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED SECURITY COSTS OR COSTS RELATED TO DEFENDING LEGAL CLAIMS. GLOBAL PRIVACY LEGISLATION, ENFORCEMENT, AND POLICY ACTIVITY IN THIS AREA ARE RAPIDLY EXPANDING AND CREATING A COMPLEX REGULATORY COMPLIANCE ENVIRONMENT. COSTS TO COMPLY WITH AND IMPLEMENT THESE PRIVACY-RELATED AND DATA PROTECTION MEASURES COULD BE SIGNIFICANT. IN ADDITION, EVEN OUR INADVERTENT FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH FEDERAL, STATE, OR INTERNATIONAL PRIVACY-RELATED OR DATA PROTECTION LAWS AND REGULATIONS COULD RESULT IN PROCEEDINGS AGAINST US BY GOVERNMENTAL ENTITIES OR OTHERS.

WE ARE SUBJECT TO RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH TRANSACTIONS.

WE INVEST IN COMPANIES FOR STRATEGIC REASONS AND MAY NOT REALIZE A RETURN ON OUR INVESTMENTS.

WE MAKE INVESTMENTS IN PUBLIC AND PRIVATE COMPANIES AROUND THE WORLD TO FURTHER OUR STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES AND SUPPORT KEY BUSINESS INITIATIVES. MANY OF THE INSTRUMENTS IN WHICH WE INVEST ARE NON-MARKETABLE AT THE TIME OF OUR INITIAL INVESTMENT. COMPANIES IN WHICH WE INVEST RANGE FROM EARLY-STAGE COMPANIES STILL DEFINING THEIR STRATEGIC DIRECTION TO MATURE COMPANIES WITH ESTABLISHED REVENUE STREAMS AND BUSINESS MODELS. THE SUCCESS OF OUR INVESTMENT IN ANY COMPANY IS TYPICALLY DEPENDENT ON THE AVAILABILITY TO THE COMPANY OF ADDITIONAL FUNDING ON FAVORABLE TERMS, OR A LIQUIDITY EVENT, SUCH AS A PUBLIC OFFERING OR ACQUISITION. IF ANY OF THE COMPANIES IN WHICH WE INVEST FAIL, WE COULD LOSE ALL OR PART OF OUR INVESTMENT.

21

TABLE OF CONTENTS

OUR ACQUISITIONS, DIVESTITURES, AND OTHER TRANSACTIONS COULD FAIL TO ACHIEVE STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES, DISRUPT OUR ONGOING BUSINESS, AND HARM OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

IN PURSUING

OUR BUSINESS STRATEGY, WE ROUTINELY CONDUCT DISCUSSIONS, EVALUATE OPPORTUNITIES, AND ENTER INTO AGREEMENTS FOR POSSIBLE ACQUISITIONS, DIVESTITURES, AND OTHER TRANSACTIONS, SUCH AS JOINT VENTURES. GIVEN THAT OUR RESOURCES ARE LIMITED, OUR DECISION TO PURSUE A TRANSACTION HAS OPPORTUNITY COSTS; ACCORDINGLY, IF WE PURSUE A PARTICULAR TRANSACTION, WE MAY NEED TO FORGO THE PROSPECT OF ENTERING INTO OTHER TRANSACTIONS THAT COULD HELP US ACHIEVE OUR STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES. IN ADDITION TO OPPORTUNITY COSTS, THESE TRANSACTIONS INVOLVE LARGE CHALLENGES AND RISKS, INCLUDING RISKS THAT.

•

THE TRANSACTION MAY NOT ADVANCE OUR BUSINESS STRATEGY;

•

WE MAY BE UNABLE TO IDENTIFY OPPORTUNITIES ON TERMS ACCEPTABLE TO US;

•

WE MAY NOT REALIZE A SATISFACTORY RETURN;

•

WE MAY EXPERIENCE DISRUPTION OF OUR ONGOING OPERATIONS;

•

WE MAY BE UNABLE TO RETAIN KEY PERSONNEL;

•

WE MAY EXPERIENCE DIFFICULTY IN INTEGRATING NEW EMPLOYEES, BUSINESS SYSTEMS, AND TECHNOLOGY;

•

ACQUIRED BUSINESSES MAY NOT HAVE ADEQUATE CONTROLS, PROCESSES, AND PROCEDURES TO ENSURE COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS AND REGULATIONS, AND OUR DUE DILIGENCE PROCESS MAY NOT IDENTIFY COMPLIANCE ISSUES OR OTHER LIABILITIES;

•

WE MAY HAVE DIFFICULTY ENTERING NEW MARKET SEGMENTS;

•

WE MAY BE UNABLE TO RETAIN THE CUSTOMERS AND PARTNERS OF ACQUIRED BUSINESSES; AND/OR

•

THERE MAY BE UNKNOWN, UNDERESTIMATED, AND/OR UNDISCLOSED COMMITMENTS OR LIABILITIES.

WHEN WE DECIDE TO SELL ASSETS OR A BUSINESS, WE MAY HAVE DIFFICULTY SELLING ON ACCEPTABLE TERMS IN A TIMELY MANNER, AND THE AGREED-UPON TERMS AND FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS COULD BE RENEGOTIATED DUE TO CHANGES IN BUSINESS OR MARKET CONDITIONS. THESE CIRCUMSTANCES COULD DELAY THE ACHIEVEMENT OF OUR STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES OR CAUSE US TO INCUR ADDITIONAL EXPENSE, OR WE MAY SELL A BUSINESS AT A PRICE OR ON TERMS THAT ARE LESS FAVORABLE THAN WE HAD ANTICIPATED, RESULTING IN A LOSS ON THE TRANSACTION.

IF WE DO ENTER INTO AGREEMENTS WITH RESPECT TO ACQUISITIONS, DIVESTITURES, OR OTHER TRANSACTIONS, WE MAY FAIL TO COMPLETE THEM DUE TO FACTORS SUCH AS.

•

FAILURE TO OBTAIN REGULATORY OR OTHER APPROVALS;

•

IP DISPUTES OR OTHER LITIGATION; OR

•

DIFFICULTIES OBTAINING FINANCING FOR THE TRANSACTION.

WE ARE SUBJECT TO SALES-RELATED RISKS.

WE FACE RISKS RELATED TO SALES THROUGH DISTRIBUTORS AND OTHER THIRD PARTIES.

WE SELL A SIGNIFICANT PORTION

OF OUR PRODUCTS THROUGH THIRD PARTIES SUCH AS DISTRIBUTORS, VALUE-ADDED RESELLERS, AND CHANNEL PARTNERS (COLLECTIVELY REFERRED TO AS DISTRIBUTORS) AS WELL AS OEMS, ODMS AND INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDERS. WE DEPEND ON MANY DISTRIBUTORS TO HELP US CREATE END CUSTOMER DEMAND, PROVIDE TECHNICAL SUPPORT AND OTHER VALUE-ADDED SERVICES TO CUSTOMERS, FILL CUSTOMER ORDERS, AND STOCK OUR PRODUCTS. WE MAY RELY ON ONE OR MORE KEY DISTRIBUTORS FOR A PRODUCT, AND A MATERIAL CHANGE IN OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH ONE OR MORE OF THESE DISTRIBUTORS OR THEIR FAILURE TO PERFORM AS EXPECTED COULD REDUCE OUR REVENUE. OUR ABILITY TO ADD OR REPLACE DISTRIBUTORS FOR SOME OF OUR PRODUCTS MAY BE LIMITED. IN ADDITION, OUR DISTRIBUTORS' EXPERTISE IN THE DETERMINATION AND STOCKING OF ACCEPTABLE INVENTORY LEVELS FOR SOME OF OUR PRODUCTS MAY NOT BE EASILY TRANSFERABLE TO A NEW DISTRIBUTOR; AS A RESULT, END CUSTOMERS MAY BE HESITANT TO ACCEPT THE ADDITION OR REPLACEMENT OF A DISTRIBUTOR. USING THIRD PARTIES FOR DISTRIBUTION EXPOSES US TO MANY RISKS, INCLUDING COMPETITIVE PRESSURE, CONCENTRATION, CREDIT RISK, AND COMPLIANCE RISKS. DISTRIBUTORS AND OTHER THIRD PARTIES MAY SELL PRODUCTS THAT COMPETE WITH OUR PRODUCTS, AND WE MAY NEED TO PROVIDE FINANCIAL AND OTHER INCENTIVES TO FOCUS THEM ON THE SALE OF OUR PRODUCTS. THEY MAY FACE FINANCIAL DIFFICULTIES, INCLUDING BANKRUPTCY, WHICH COULD HARM OUR COLLECTION OF ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND FINANCIAL RESULTS. VIOLATIONS OF THE FOREIGN CORRUPT PRACTICES ACT OR SIMILAR LAWS BY DISTRIBUTORS OR OTHER THIRD-PARTY INTERMEDIARIES COULD HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR BUSINESS. FAILURE TO MANAGE RISKS RELATED TO OUR USE OF DISTRIBUTORS AND OTHER THIRD PARTIES MAY REDUCE SALES, INCREASE EXPENSES, AND WEAKEN OUR COMPETITIVE POSITION.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

WE FACE RISKS RELATED TO BUSINESS TRANSACTIONS WITH U.S. GOVERNMENT ENTITIES.

WE RECEIVE PROCEEDS FROM SERVICES AND PRODUCTS WE PROVIDE TO THE U.S. GOVERNMENT. U.S. GOVERNMENT DEMAND AND PAYMENT MAY BE AFFECTED BY PUBLIC SECTOR BUDGETARY CYCLES AND FUNDING AUTHORIZATIONS. U.S. GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS ARE SUBJECT TO OVERSIGHT, INCLUDING SPECIAL RULES ON ACCOUNTING, IP RIGHTS, EXPENSES, REVIEWS, INFORMATION HANDLING, AND SECURITY. FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH THESE RULES COULD RESULT IN CIVIL AND CRIMINAL PENALTIES AND SANCTIONS, INCLUDING TERMINATION OF CONTRACTS, FINES, AND SUSPENSIONS, OR DEBARMENT FROM FUTURE U.S. GOVERNMENT BUSINESS.

OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COULD VARY AS A RESULT OF THE METHODS, ESTIMATES, AND JUDGMENTS THAT WE USE IN APPLYING ACCOUNTING POLICIES.

THE METHODS, ESTIMATES, AND JUDGMENTS USED IN APPLYING ACCOUNTING POLICIES ARE SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT RISKS, UNCERTAINTIES, ASSUMPTIONS, AND CHANGES THAT COULD AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL POSITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. FOR MORE INFORMATION, SEE "CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES" IN PART II, ITEM 7 AND "NOTE 2: ACCOUNTING POLICIES" IN PART II, ITEM 8 OF THIS FORM 10-K.

CHANGES IN OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE MAY REDUCE OUR NET INCOME.

A NUMBER OF FACTORS MAY INCREASE OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATES, WHICH COULD REDUCE OUR NET INCOME, INCLUDING.

•

CHANGES IN JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH OUR PROFITS ARE DETERMINED TO BE EARNED AND TAXED;

•

THE RESOLUTION OF ISSUES ARISING FROM TAX AUDITS;

•

CHANGES IN THE VALUATION OF OUR DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, AND IN DEFERRED TAX VALUATION ALLOWANCES;

•

ADJUSTMENTS TO INCOME TAXES UPON FINALIZATION OF TAX RETURNS;

•

INCREASES IN EXPENSES NOT DEDUCTIBLE FOR TAX PURPOSES, INCLUDING IMPAIRMENTS OF GOODWILL;

•

CHANGES IN AVAILABLE TAX CREDITS;

•

CHANGES IN TAX LAWS OR THEIR INTERPRETATION, INCLUDING CHANGES IN THE U.S. TO THE TAXATION OF MANUFACTURING ENTERPRISES AND OF NON-U.S. INCOME AND EXPENSES;

•

CHANGES IN U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES; AND

•

OUR DECISION TO REPATRIATE NON-U.S. EARNINGS FOR WHICH WE HAVE NOT PREVIOUSLY PROVIDED FOR U.S. TAXES.

WE MAY HAVE FLUCTUATIONS IN THE AMOUNT AND FREQUENCY OF OUR STOCK REPURCHASES.

THE AMOUNT, TIMING, AND EXECUTION OF OUR STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM MAY FLUCTUATE BASED ON OUR PRIORITIES FOR THE USE OF CASH FOR OTHER PURPOSES—SUCH AS INVESTING IN OUR BUSINESS, INCLUDING OPERATIONAL SPENDING, CAPITAL SPENDING, AND ACQUISITIONS, AND RETURNING CASH TO OUR STOCKHOLDERS AS DIVIDEND PAYMENTS—AND BECAUSE OF CHANGES IN CASH FLOWS AND CHANGES IN TAX LAWS.

WORKFORCE RESTRUCTURING ACTIONS MAY BE DISRUPTIVE TO OUR OPERATIONS AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS.

IN RESPONSE TO THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT AND TO ACCOMPLISH OUR STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES, WE HAVE ANNOUNCED RESTRUCTURINGS OF OUR OPERATIONS AND HAVE MADE OTHER ADJUSTMENTS TO OUR WORKFORCE. WE MAY PURSUE SIMILAR ACTIONS IN THE FUTURE, AND SUCH WORKFORCE CHANGES CAN RESULT IN RESTRUCTURING CHARGES IN ADDITION TO THOSE DESCRIBED IN "

NOTE 7: RESTRUCTURING AND OTHER CHARGES

" IN PART II, ITEM 8 OF THIS FORM 10-K. ANY SUCH WORKFORCE CHANGES CAN ALSO TEMPORARILY REDUCE WORKFORCE PRODUCTIVITY, WHICH COULD BE DISRUPTIVE TO OUR BUSINESS AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. IN ADDITION, IF OUR RESTRUCTURINGS ARE PERCEIVED NEGATIVELY, OUR CORPORATE REPUTATION AND ABILITY TO ATTRACT EMPLOYEES COULD SUFFER. MOREOVER, WE MAY NOT ACHIEVE OR SUSTAIN THE EXPECTED COST SAVINGS OR OTHER BENEFITS OF OUR RESTRUCTURING PLANS, OR DO SO WITHIN THE EXPECTED TIME FRAME.

ADDITIONAL FACTORS THAT COULD CAUSE ACTUAL RESULTS TO DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM OUR EXPECTATIONS WITH REGARD TO OUR RESTRUCTURING ACTIVITY INCLUDE.

•

TIMING AND EXECUTION OF PLANS AND PROGRAMS THAT MAY BE SUBJECT TO LOCAL LABOR LAW REQUIREMENTS, INCLUDING CONSULTATION WITH APPROPRIATE WORKS COUNCILS;

•

ASSUMPTIONS RELATED TO SEVERANCE, POST-RETIREMENT, AND RELOCATION COSTS;

•

FUTURE ACQUISITIONS, DISPOSITIONS, OR INVESTMENTS;

•

NEW BUSINESS INITIATIVES AND CHANGES IN PRODUCT ROADMAP, DEVELOPMENT, AND MANUFACTURING; AND/OR

•

ASSUMPTIONS RELATED TO COST SAVINGS, PRODUCT DEMAND, AND OPERATING EFFICIENCIES.

THERE ARE INHERENT LIMITATIONS ON THE EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR CONTROLS.

WE DO NOT EXPECT THAT OUR DISCLOSURE CONTROLS OR OUR INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING WILL PREVENT OR DETECT ALL ERRORS AND ALL FRAUD. A CONTROL SYSTEM, NO MATTER HOW WELL-DESIGNED AND OPERATED, CAN PROVIDE ONLY REASONABLE, NOT ABSOLUTE, ASSURANCE THAT THE CONTROL SYSTEM’S OBJECTIVES WILL BE MET. THE DESIGN OF A CONTROL SYSTEM MUST REFLECT THE FACT THAT RESOURCE CONSTRAINTS EXIST, AND THE BENEFITS OF CONTROLS MUST BE CONSIDERED RELATIVE TO THEIR COSTS. FURTHER, BECAUSE OF THE INHERENT LIMITATIONS IN ALL CONTROL SYSTEMS, NO EVALUATION OF CONTROLS CAN PROVIDE ABSOLUTE ASSURANCE THAT MISSTATEMENTS DUE TO ERROR OR FRAUD WILL NOT OCCUR OR THAT ALL CONTROL ISSUES AND INSTANCES OF FRAUD, IF ANY, HAVE BEEN DETECTED. THE DESIGN OF ANY SYSTEM OF CONTROLS IS BASED IN PART ON CERTAIN ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT THE LIKELIHOOD OF FUTURE EVENTS, AND THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT ANY DESIGN WILL SUCCEED IN ACHIEVING ITS STATED GOALS UNDER ALL POTENTIAL FUTURE CONDITIONS.

2016 HAS BEEN A TRANSFORMATIVE YEAR FOR INTEL. WE HAVE MADE STRIDES TO MOVE FROM A PC CENTRIC COMPANY TO ONE THAT IS POWERING THE CLOUD AND BILLIONS OF SMART, CONNECTED DEVICES.

WE ARE BUILDING ON OUR STRONG POSITION IN CLIENT COMPUTING AND ARE INVESTING FOR GROWTH IN THE DATA CENTER, INTERNET OF THINGS MARKET SEGMENTS, AND DISRUPTIVE DIFFERENTIATED MEMORY TECHNOLOGY. TO ACCELERATE OUR TRANSFORMATION, IN

Q2 2016

, WE ANNOUNCED THE 2016 RESTRUCTURING PROGRAM, WHICH IS ON TRACK TO REDUCE OUR HEADCOUNT AND GENERATE SAVINGS.

WE ARE REALLOCATING THESE SAVINGS TO OUR GROWTH SEGMENTS, SUCH AS THE DATA CENTER AND INTERNET OF THINGS, AND ARE CONTINUING TO INVEST IN AREAS THAT EXTEND OUR LEADERSHIP IN MOORE'S LAW AND EXPAND MARKET OPPORTUNITIES IN AREAS SUCH AS MEMORY AND AUTONOMOUS DRIVING.

IN Q1 2016, WE COMPLETED THE ACQUISITION OF ALTERA, A GLOBAL SEMICONDUCTOR COMPANY THAT DESIGNS AND SELLS PROGRAMMABLE SEMICONDUCTORS AND RELATED PRODUCTS, AND SUBSEQUENTLY FORMED PSG. WE HAVE WORKED TO INTEGRATE ALTERA THROUGHOUT 2016 AND THE BUSINESS CONTINUES TO DELIVER NEW PRODUCTS AND TO GROW. IN SEPTEMBER 2016, TO FURTHER ACCELERATE OUR TRANSFORMATION AND FOCUS OUR BUSINESS ON CORE STRATEGIC AREAS, WE ANNOUNCED THE PLANNED DIVESTITURE OF ISECG.

OUR BUSINESS OUTLOOK FOR

Q1 2017

AND FULL YEAR

2017

INCLUDES, WHERE APPLICABLE, OUR CURRENT EXPECTATIONS FOR REVENUE, GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE, SPENDING (R&D PLUS MG&A), AND CAPITAL EXPENDITURES.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

THE METHODS, ESTIMATES, AND JUDGMENTS THAT WE USE IN APPLYING OUR ACCOUNTING POLICIES HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON OUR FINANCIAL POSITION AND THE RESULTS THAT WE REPORT IN OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. SOME OF THESE POLICIES REQUIRE US TO MAKE SUBJECTIVE ESTIMATES AND APPLY JUDGMENT REGARDING MATTERS THAT ARE INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN.

OUR MOST CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES INCLUDE.

•

THE VALUATION OF INVENTORY, WHICH IMPACTS GROSS MARGIN;

•

THE DETERMINATION OF USEFUL LIVES FOR OUR PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT AND THE TIMING OF WHEN DEPRECIATION SHOULD BEGIN, WHICH IMPACTS OUR GROSS MARGIN, R&D EXPENSES, AND TO A LESSER EXTENT MG&A EXPENSES;

•

THE DETERMINATION OF OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENTS FOR NON-MARKETABLE EQUITY INVESTMENTS REQUIRES THE USE OF ESTIMATES ABOUT THEIR VALUATIONS, WHICH IMPACTS GAINS OR LOSSES ON EQUITY INVESTMENTS, NET;

•

THE VALUATION AND THE ALLOCATION OF PURCHASE PRICE PAID FOR ASSETS ACQUIRED AND LIABILITIES ASSUMED IN CONNECTION WITH OUR ACQUISITIONS, WHICH IMPACTS OUR GROSS MARGIN AND OPERATING EXPENSES IN PERIODS SUBSEQUENT TO THE ACQUISITION;

•

THE EVALUATION OF RECOVERABILITY OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS (PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT; IDENTIFIED INTANGIBLES; AND GOODWILL), WHICH IMPACTS GROSS MARGIN OR OPERATING EXPENSES WHEN WE RECORD IMPAIRMENTS OR ACCELERATE THEIR DEPRECIATION OR AMORTIZATION;

•

THE RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT OF CURRENT AND DEFERRED INCOME TAXES (INCLUDING THE MEASUREMENT OF UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS), WHICH IMPACT OUR PROVISION FOR TAXES AS WELL AS TAX-RELATED ASSETS AND LIABILITIES; AND

•

THE RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT OF LOSS CONTINGENCIES, WHICH IMPACT GROSS MARGIN OR OPERATING EXPENSES WHEN WE RECOGNIZE A LOSS CONTINGENCY, REVISE THE ESTIMATE FOR A LOSS CONTINGENCY, OR RECORD AN ASSET IMPAIRMENT.

OPERATING ACTIVITIES

CASH

PROVIDED BY

OPERATING ACTIVITIES IS NET INCOME ADJUSTED FOR CERTAIN NON-CASH ITEMS AND CHANGES IN ASSETS AND LIABILITIES.

FOR

2016

COMPARED TO

2015

, THE

$2.8 BILLION

INCREASE

IN CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES WAS DUE TO ADJUSTMENTS FOR NON-CASH ITEMS AND CHANGES IN WORKING CAPITAL, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER NET INCOME. THE ADJUSTMENTS FOR NON-CASH ITEMS WERE HIGHER IN 2016 PRIMARILY DUE TO RESTRUCTURING AND OTHER CHARGES AND THE CHANGE IN DEFERRED TAXES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER DEPRECIATION EXPENSE. INCOME TAXES PAID, NET OF REFUNDS, IN

2016

COMPARED TO

2015

WERE

$2.6 BILLION

LOWER

DUE TO BONUS DEPRECIATION ON CAPITAL ASSETS PLACED IN SERVICE, AS WELL AS TIMING OF CERTAIN TAX PAYMENTS AND REFUNDS.

FOR

2015

COMPARED TO

2014

, THE

$1.4 BILLION

DECREASE

IN CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES WAS DUE TO CHANGES IN WORKING CAPITAL, ADJUSTMENTS FOR NON-CASH ITEMS, AND LOWER NET INCOME. THE ADJUSTMENTS FOR NON-CASH ITEMS WERE LOWER DUE PRIMARILY TO DEFERRED TAXES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER DEPRECIATION.

INVESTING ACTIVITIES

INVESTING CASH FLOWS CONSIST PRIMARILY OF CAPITAL EXPENDITURES; INVESTMENT PURCHASES, SALES, MATURITIES, AND DISPOSALS; AND PROCEEDS FROM DIVESTITURES AND CASH USED FOR ACQUISITIONS. OUR CAPITAL EXPENDITURES WERE

$9.6 BILLION

IN

2016

(

$7.3 BILLION

IN

2015

AND

$10.1 BILLION

IN

2014

).

THE

INCREASE

IN CASH USED FOR INVESTING ACTIVITIES IN

2016

COMPARED TO

2015

WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO OUR COMPLETED ACQUISITION OF ALTERA, NET PURCHASES OF TRADING ASSETS IN

2016

COMPARED TO NET SALES OF TRADING ASSETS IN

2015

, AND HIGHER CAPITAL EXPENDITURES IN 2016. THIS INCREASE WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER INVESTMENTS IN NON-MARKETABLE EQUITY INVESTMENTS AND COLLECTION OF LOANS RECEIVABLE AND REVERSE REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS.

THE

DECREASE

IN CASH USED FOR INVESTING ACTIVITIES IN

2015

COMPARED TO

2014

WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO CASH GENERATED BY NET TRADING ASSET ACTIVITY AND LOWER CAPITAL EXPENDITURES DURING

2015

. THIS ACTIVITY WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY NET AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE ACTIVITY (WHICH WAS CASH FLOW NEUTRAL IN

2015

COMPARED TO A SOURCE OF CASH IN

2014

) AND HIGHER INVESTMENTS IN NON-MARKETABLE EQUITY INVESTMENTS DURING

2015.

FINANCING ACTIVITIES

FINANCING CASH FLOWS CONSIST PRIMARILY OF REPURCHASES OF COMMON STOCK, PAYMENT OF DIVIDENDS TO STOCKHOLDERS, ISSUANCE AND REPAYMENT OF SHORT-TERM AND LONG-TERM DEBT, AND PROCEEDS FROM THE SALE OF SHARES OF COMMON STOCK THROUGH EMPLOYEE EQUITY INCENTIVE PLANS.

CASH WAS

USED FOR

FINANCING ACTIVITIES IN

2016

COMPARED TO CASH PROVIDED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES IN

2015

, PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER PROCEEDS FROM DEBT ISSUANCES AND THE REPAYMENT OF

$1.5 BILLION

OF DEBT IN 2016. THESE AMOUNTS WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY REPAYMENT OF COMMERCIAL PAPER IN

2015

AND FEWER REPURCHASES OF COMMON STOCK UNDER OUR AUTHORIZED STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM.

WE HAVE AN ONGOING AUTHORIZATION, ORIGINALLY APPROVED BY OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS IN 2005, AND SUBSEQUENTLY AMENDED, TO REPURCHASE UP TO

$65.0 BILLION

IN SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK IN THE OPEN MARKET OR NEGOTIATED TRANSACTIONS. DURING

2016

, WE REPURCHASED

$2.6 BILLION

OF COMMON STOCK UNDER OUR AUTHORIZED COMMON STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM, COMPARED TO

$3.0 BILLION

IN

2015

. AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2016

,

$6.8 BILLION

REMAINED AVAILABLE FOR REPURCHASING COMMON STOCK UNDER THE EXISTING REPURCHASE AUTHORIZATION LIMIT. WE BASE OUR LEVEL OF COMMON STOCK REPURCHASES ON INTERNAL CASH MANAGEMENT DECISIONS, AND THIS LEVEL MAY FLUCTUATE. PROCEEDS FROM THE SALE OF COMMON STOCK THROUGH EMPLOYEE EQUITY INCENTIVE PLANS TOTALED

$1.1 BILLION

IN

2016

COMPARED TO

$866 MILLION

IN

2015

. OUR TOTAL DIVIDEND PAYMENTS WERE

$4.9 BILLION

IN

2016

COMPARED TO

$4.6 BILLION

IN

2015

. WE HAVE PAID A CASH DIVIDEND IN EACH OF THE PAST

97

QUARTERS. IN JANUARY

2017

, OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS DECLARED A CASH DIVIDEND OF

$0.26

PER SHARE OF COMMON STOCK FOR Q1

2017

. THE DIVIDEND IS PAYABLE ON MARCH 1,

2017

TO STOCKHOLDERS OF RECORD ON FEBRUARY 7,

2017.

CASH WAS PROVIDED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES IN

2015

COMPARED TO CASH USED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES IN

2014

, PRIMARILY DUE TO THE ISSUANCE OF LONG-TERM DEBT IN

2015

AND FEWER REPURCHASES OF COMMON STOCK UNDER OUR AUTHORIZED STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM IN

2015

COMPARED TO

2014

. THIS ACTIVITY WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER PROCEEDS FROM THE SALES OF COMMON STOCK IN

2015

AND REPAYMENTS OF SHORT-TERM DEBT IN

2015

COMPARED TO BORROWINGS IN

2014.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)

LIQUIDITY

CASH GENERATED BY OPERATIONS IS OUR PRIMARY SOURCE OF LIQUIDITY. WE MAINTAIN A DIVERSE INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO THAT WE CONTINUALLY ANALYZE BASED ON ISSUER, INDUSTRY, AND COUNTRY. WHEN ASSESSING OUR SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY WE INCLUDE INVESTMENTS AS SHOWN IN THE LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES TABLE.

SUBSTANTIALLY ALL

OF OUR INVESTMENTS IN DEBT INSTRUMENTS AND FINANCING RECEIVABLES ARE IN INVESTMENT-GRADE SECURITIES.

OTHER POTENTIAL SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY INCLUDE OUR COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAM AND OUR AUTOMATIC SHELF REGISTRATION STATEMENT ON FILE WITH THE SEC, PURSUANT TO WHICH WE MAY OFFER AN UNSPECIFIED AMOUNT OF DEBT, EQUITY, AND OTHER SECURITIES. UNDER OUR COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAM, WE HAVE AN ONGOING AUTHORIZATION FROM OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS TO BORROW UP TO

$5.0 BILLION.

NO

COMMERCIAL PAPER REMAINED OUTSTANDING AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2016

. ON DECEMBER 21, 2015, WE ENTERED INTO A SHORT-TERM CREDIT FACILITY TO BORROW UP TO

$5.0 BILLION

TO FACILITATE THE SETTLEMENT OF OUR ACQUISITION OF ALTERA. UNDER THIS CREDIT FACILITY WE BORROWED

$4.0 BILLION

, AND THE FACILITY WAS CLOSED IN JANUARY 2016. IN Q2 2016, WE ISSUED

$2.8 BILLION

AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF SENIOR UNSECURED NOTES TO REFINANCE EXISTING INDEBTEDNESS, INCLUDING OUR

1.95%

SENIOR NOTES DUE

2016

AND A PORTION OF OUR

1.35%

SENIOR NOTES DUE

2017.

AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2016

,

$13.6 BILLION

OF OUR

$17.1 BILLION

OF CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS, SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS, AND TRADING ASSETS WAS HELD BY OUR NON-U.S. SUBSIDIARIES. OF THE

$13.6 BILLION

HELD BY OUR NON-U.S. SUBSIDIARIES, APPROXIMATELY

$1.5 BILLION

WAS AVAILABLE FOR USE IN THE U.S. WITHOUT INCURRING ADDITIONAL U.S. INCOME TAXES IN EXCESS OF THE AMOUNTS ALREADY ACCRUED IN OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2016

. THE REMAINING AMOUNT OF NON-U.S. CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS, SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS, AND TRADING ASSETS HAS BEEN INDEFINITELY REINVESTED AND, THEREFORE, NO U.S. CURRENT OR DEFERRED TAXES HAVE BEEN ACCRUED. THIS AMOUNT IS EARMARKED FOR NEAR-TERM INVESTMENT IN OUR OPERATIONS OUTSIDE THE U.S. AND FUTURE ACQUISITIONS OF NON-U.S. ENTITIES. WE BELIEVE OUR U.S. SOURCES OF CASH AND LIQUIDITY ARE SUFFICIENT TO MEET OUR BUSINESS NEEDS IN THE U.S., AND DO NOT EXPECT THAT WE WILL NEED TO REPATRIATE THE FUNDS WE HAVE DESIGNATED AS INDEFINITELY REINVESTED OUTSIDE THE U.S. UNDER CURRENT TAX LAWS, SHOULD OUR PLANS CHANGE AND WE WERE TO CHOOSE TO REPATRIATE SOME OR ALL OF THE FUNDS WE HAVE DESIGNATED AS INDEFINITELY REINVESTED OUTSIDE THE U.S., SUCH AMOUNTS WOULD BE SUBJECT TO U.S. INCOME TAXES AND APPLICABLE NON-U.S. INCOME AND WITHHOLDING TAXES.

WE BELIEVE WE HAVE SUFFICIENT FINANCIAL RESOURCES TO MEET OUR BUSINESS REQUIREMENTS IN THE NEXT 12 MONTHS, INCLUDING CAPITAL EXPENDITURES FOR WORLDWIDE MANUFACTURING AND ASSEMBLY AND TEST; WORKING CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS; AND POTENTIAL DIVIDENDS, COMMON STOCK REPURCHASES, ACQUISITIONS, AND STRATEGIC INVESTMENTS.

CAPITAL PURCHASE OBLIGATIONS REPRESENT COMMITMENTS FOR THE CONSTRUCTION OR PURCHASE OF PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT. THEY WERE NOT RECORDED AS LIABILITIES ON OUR CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2016

, AS WE HAD NOT YET RECEIVED THE RELATED GOODS OR TAKEN TITLE TO THE PROPERTY.

2

OTHER PURCHASE OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS INCLUDE PAYMENTS DUE UNDER VARIOUS TYPES OF LICENSES AND AGREEMENTS TO PURCHASE GOODS OR SERVICES, AS WELL AS PAYMENTS DUE UNDER NON-CONTINGENT FUNDING OBLIGATIONS.

3

AMOUNTS REPRESENT PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST CASH PAYMENTS OVER THE LIFE OF THE DEBT OBLIGATIONS, INCLUDING ANTICIPATED INTEREST PAYMENTS THAT ARE NOT RECORDED ON OUR CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS. DEBT OBLIGATIONS ARE

CLASSIFIED BASED ON THEIR STATED MATURITY DATE, REGARDLESS OF THEIR CLASSIFICATION ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET

S. ANY FUTURE SETTLEMENT OF CONVERTIBLE DEBT WOULD IMPACT OUR CASH PAYMENTS.

4

WE ARE UNABLE TO RELIABLY ESTIMATE THE TIMING OF FUTURE PAYMENTS RELATED TO UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS; THEREFORE,

$125 MILLION

OF LONG-TERM INCOME TAXES PAYABLE HAS BEEN EXCLUDED FROM THE PRECEDING TABLE. HOWEVER, LONG-TERM INCOME TAXES PAYABLE, RECORDED ON OUR CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS, INCLUDED THESE UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS, REDUCED BY THE ASSOCIATED FEDERAL DEDUCTION FOR STATE TAXES AND U.S. TAX CREDITS ARISING FROM NON-U.S. INCOME TAXES.

5

AMOUNTS REPRESENT FUTURE CASH PAYMENTS TO SATISFY OTHER LONG-TERM LIABILITIES RECORDED ON OUR CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS, INCLUDING THE SHORT-TERM PORTION OF THESE LONG-TERM LIABILITIES. EXPECTED REQUIRED CONTRIBUTIONS TO OUR U.S. AND NON-U.S. PENSION PLANS AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS OF

$36 MILLION

TO BE MADE DURING

2017

ARE ALSO INCLUDED; HOWEVER, FUNDING PROJECTIONS BEYOND

2017

ARE NOT PRACTICABLE TO ESTIMATE. DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS ARE EXCLUDED FROM THE PRECEDING TABLE, AS THEY DO NOT REPRESENT THE AMOUNTS THAT MAY ULTIMATELY BE PAID.

6

TOTAL EXCLUDES CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS ALREADY RECORDED ON OUR CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS AS CURRENT LIABILITIES, EXCEPT FOR THE SHORT-TERM PORTIONS OF LONG-TERM DEBT OBLIGATIONS AND OTHER LONG-TERM LIABILITIES.

THE EXPECTED TIMING OF PAYMENTS OF THE OBLIGATIONS IN THE PRECEDING TABLE IS ESTIMATED BASED ON CURRENT INFORMATION. TIMING OF PAYMENTS AND ACTUAL AMOUNTS PAID MAY BE DIFFERENT, DEPENDING ON THE TIME OF RECEIPT OF GOODS OR SERVICES, OR CHANGES TO AGREED-UPON AMOUNTS FOR SOME OBLIGATIONS.

CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS FOR PURCHASES OF GOODS OR SERVICES INCLUDED IN "OTHER PURCHASE OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS" IN THE PRECEDING TABLE INCLUDE AGREEMENTS THAT ARE ENFORCEABLE AND LEGALLY BINDING ON INTEL AND THAT SPECIFY ALL SIGNIFICANT TERMS, INCLUDING FIXED OR MINIMUM QUANTITIES TO BE PURCHASED; FIXED, MINIMUM, OR VARIABLE PRICE PROVISIONS; AND THE APPROXIMATE TIMING OF THE TRANSACTION. FOR OBLIGATIONS WITH CANCELLATION PROVISIONS, THE AMOUNTS INCLUDED IN THE PRECEDING TABLE WERE LIMITED TO THE NON-CANCELABLE PORTION OF THE AGREEMENT TERMS OR THE MINIMUM CANCELLATION FEE.

WE HAVE ENTERED INTO CERTAIN AGREEMENTS FOR THE PURCHASE OF RAW MATERIALS THAT SPECIFY MINIMUM PRICES AND QUANTITIES BASED ON A PERCENTAGE OF THE TOTAL AVAILABLE MARKET OR BASED ON A PERCENTAGE OF OUR FUTURE PURCHASING REQUIREMENTS. DUE TO THE UNCERTAINTY OF THE FUTURE MARKET AND OUR FUTURE PURCHASING REQUIREMENTS, AS WELL AS THE NON-BINDING NATURE OF THESE AGREEMENTS, OBLIGATIONS UNDER THESE AGREEMENTS HAVE BEEN EXCLUDED FROM THE PRECEDING TABLE. OUR PURCHASE ORDERS FOR OTHER PRODUCTS ARE BASED ON OUR CURRENT MANUFACTURING NEEDS AND ARE FULFILLED BY OUR VENDORS WITHIN SHORT TIME HORIZONS. IN ADDITION, SOME OF OUR PURCHASE ORDERS REPRESENT AUTHORIZATIONS TO PURCHASE RATHER THAN BINDING AGREEMENTS.

CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS THAT ARE CONTINGENT UPON THE ACHIEVEMENT OF CERTAIN MILESTONES HAVE BEEN EXCLUDED FROM THE PRECEDING TABLE. THESE OBLIGATIONS INCLUDE MILESTONE-BASED CO-MARKETING AGREEMENTS, CONTINGENT FUNDING OR PAYMENT OBLIGATIONS, AND MILESTONE-BASED EQUITY INVESTMENT FUNDING (EXCLUDING INVESTMENT FUNDING THAT IS PENDING REGULATORY APPROVAL). THESE ARRANGEMENTS ARE NOT CONSIDERED CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS UNTIL THE MILESTONE IS MET BY THE COUNTERPARTY. AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2016

, ASSUMING THAT ALL FUTURE MILESTONES ARE MET, EXCLUDING THE ASML MILESTONES MENTIONED BELOW, THE ADDITIONAL REQUIRED PAYMENTS WOULD BE APPROXIMATELY

$694 MILLION.

DURING 2012, WE ENTERED INTO A SERIES OF AGREEMENTS WITH

ASML INTENDED TO ACCELERATE THE DEVELOPMENT OF EUV LITHOGRAPHY, CERTAIN OF WHICH WERE AMENDED IN 2014. UNDER THE AMENDED AGREEMENTS,

INTEL AGREED TO PROVIDE R&D FUNDING TOTALING

€829 MILLION

OVER FIVE YEARS AND COMMITTED TO ADVANCE PURCHASE ORDERS FOR A SPECIFIED NUMBER OF TOOLS FROM ASML.

OUR REMAINING OBLIGATION, CONTINGENT UPON ASML ACHIEVING CERTAIN MILESTONES, IS APPROXIMATELY

€193 MILLION

, OR

$202 MILLION

, AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2016

. AS OUR OBLIGATION IS CONTINGENT UPON ASML ACHIEVING CERTAIN MILESTONES, WE HAVE EXCLUDED THIS OBLIGATION FROM

THE PRECEDING TABLE.

FOR THE MAJORITY OF RSUS GRANTED, THE NUMBER OF SHARES OF COMMON STOCK ISSUED ON THE DATE THE RSUS VEST IS NET OF THE MINIMUM STATUTORY WITHHOLDING REQUIREMENTS THAT WE PAY IN CASH TO THE APPROPRIATE TAXING AUTHORITIES ON BEHALF OF OUR EMPLOYEES.

THE OBLIGATION TO PAY THE RELEVANT TAXING AUTHORITY IS EXCLUDED FROM THE PRECEDING TABLE, AS THE AMOUNT IS CONTINGENT UPON CONTINUED EMPLOYMENT. IN ADDITION, THE AMOUNT OF THE OBLIGATION IS UNKNOWN, AS IT IS BASED IN PART ON THE MARKET PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK WHEN THE AWARDS VEST.

DURING 2014, WE ENTERED INTO A SERIES OF AGREEMENTS WITH TSINGHUA UNIGROUP LTD. (TSINGHUA UNIGROUP), AN OPERATING SUBSIDIARY OF TSINGHUA HOLDINGS CO. LTD., TO, AMONG OTHER THINGS, JOINTLY DEVELOP INTEL ARCHITECTURE- AND COMMUNICATIONS-BASED SOLUTIONS FOR PHONES. SUBJECT TO REGULATORY APPROVALS AND OTHER CLOSING CONDITIONS, WE HAVE ALSO AGREED TO INVEST UP TO

9.0 BILLION

CHINESE YUAN (APPROXIMATELY

$1.5 BILLION

AS OF THE DATE OF THE AGREEMENT) FOR A MINORITY STAKE OF APPROXIMATELY

20%

OF BEIJING UNISPREADTRUM TECHNOLOGY LTD. (UNISPREADTRUM). DURING 2015, WE INVESTED

$966 MILLION

TO COMPLETE THE FIRST PHASE OF THE EQUITY INVESTMENT. THE SECOND PHASE OF THE INVESTMENT WILL REQUIRE ADDITIONAL FUNDING OF APPROXIMATELY

$500 MILLION

; HOWEVER, AS OUR OBLIGATION IS CONTINGENT UPON REGULATORY APPROVALS AND OTHER CLOSING CONDITIONS, IT HAS BEEN EXCLUDED FROM THE PRECEDING TABLE.

OFF-BALANCE-SHEET ARRANGEMENTS

AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2016

, WE DID NOT HAVE ANY SIGNIFICANT OFF-BALANCE-SHEET ARRANGEMENTS, AS DEFINED IN ITEM 303(A)(4)(II) OF SEC REGULATION S-K.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

ITEM 7A.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

WE ARE AFFECTED BY CHANGES IN CURRENCY EXCHANGE AND INTEREST RATES, AS WELL AS EQUITY AND COMMODITY PRICES. OUR RISK MANAGEMENT PROGRAMS REDUCE, BUT MAY NOT ENTIRELY ELIMINATE, THE IMPACT OF THESE RISKS. ALL OF THE FOLLOWING POTENTIAL CHANGES ARE BASED ON SENSITIVITY ANALYSES PERFORMED ON OUR FINANCIAL POSITIONS AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2016

AND

DECEMBER 26, 2015

. ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER MATERIALLY.

CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES

WE ARE EXPOSED TO CURRENCY EXCHANGE RISKS OF NON-U.S.-DOLLAR-DENOMINATED INVESTMENTS IN DEBT INSTRUMENTS AND LOANS RECEIVABLE, AND MAY ECONOMICALLY HEDGE THIS RISK WITH FOREIGN CURRENCY CONTRACTS, SUCH AS CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS OR CURRENCY INTEREST RATE SWAPS. GAINS OR LOSSES ON THESE NON-U.S.-CURRENCY INVESTMENTS ARE GENERALLY OFFSET BY CORRESPONDING LOSSES OR GAINS ON THE RELATED HEDGING INSTRUMENTS. WE ARE EXPOSED TO CURRENCY EXCHANGE RISKS FROM OUR NON-U.S.-DOLLAR-DENOMINATED DEBT INDEBTEDNESS AND MAY USE FOREIGN CURRENCY CONTRACTS DESIGNATED AS CASH FLOW HEDGES TO MANAGE THIS RISK.

SUBSTANTIALLY ALL

OF OUR REVENUE IS TRANSACTED IN U.S. DOLLARS. HOWEVER, A

SIGNIFICANT

PORTION OF OUR OPERATING EXPENDITURES AND CAPITAL PURCHASES ARE INCURRED IN OTHER CURRENCIES,

PRIMARILY THE EURO, THE JAPANESE YEN, THE ISRAELI SHEKEL, AND THE CHINESE YUAN

. WE HAVE ESTABLISHED CURRENCY RISK MANAGEMENT PROGRAMS TO PROTECT AGAINST CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH NON-U.S. DOLLAR FORECASTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS AND EXISTING NON-U.S. DOLLAR MONETARY ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. WE MAY ALSO HEDGE CURRENCY RISK ARISING FROM FUNDING OF FOREIGN CURRENCY-DENOMINATED FUTURE INVESTMENTS. WE MAY UTILIZE FOREIGN CURRENCY CONTRACTS, SUCH AS CURRENCY FORWARD OR OPTION CONTRACTS IN THESE HEDGING PROGRAMS. WE CONSIDERED THE HISTORICAL TRENDS IN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES AND DETERMINED THAT IT WAS REASONABLY POSSIBLE THAT A WEIGHTED AVERAGE ADVERSE CHANGE OF

20%

IN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES COULD BE EXPERIENCED IN THE NEAR TERM. SUCH AN ADVERSE CHANGE, AFTER TAKING INTO ACCOUNT BALANCE SHEET HEDGES ONLY AND OFFSETTING RECORDED MONETARY ASSET AND LIABILITY POSITIONS, WOULD HAVE RESULTED IN AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON INCOME BEFORE TAXES OF LESS THAN

$80 MILLION

AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2016

(LESS THAN

$75 MILLION

AS OF

DECEMBER 26, 2015

).

INTEREST RATES

WE ARE EXPOSED TO INTEREST RATE RISK RELATED TO OUR FIXED-RATE INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO AND OUTSTANDING DEBT. THE PRIMARY OBJECTIVE OF OUR INVESTMENT POLICY IS TO PRESERVE PRINCIPAL AND THE FINANCIAL FLEXIBILITY TO FUND OUR BUSINESS WHILE MAXIMIZING YIELDS, WHICH GENERALLY TRACK THE U.S. DOLLAR THREE-MONTH LIBOR. WE GENERALLY ENTER INTO INTEREST RATE CONTRACTS TO CONVERT THE RETURNS ON OUR FIXED-RATE DEBT INVESTMENT WITH REMAINING MATURITIES LONGER THAN SIX MONTHS INTO U.S. DOLLAR THREE-MONTH LIBOR-BASED RETURNS. WE MAY ENTER INTO SWAPS TO CONVERT FIXED-RATE COUPON PAYMENTS INTO FLOATING-RATE COUPON PAYMENTS FOR OUR EXISTING INDEBTEDNESS. GAINS OR LOSSES ON THESE INSTRUMENTS ARE GENERALLY OFFSET BY CORRESPONDING LOSSES OR GAINS ON THE RELATED HEDGING INSTRUMENTS.

A HYPOTHETICAL DECREASE IN BENCHMARK INTEREST RATES OF UP TO

1.0%

, AFTER TAKING INTO ACCOUNT INVESTMENT HEDGES, WOULD HAVE RESULTED IN AN INCREASE IN THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO OF APPROXIMATELY

$100 MILLION

AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2016

(AN INCREASE OF APPROXIMATELY

$15 MILLION

AS OF

DECEMBER 26, 2015

). AFTER TAKING INTO ACCOUNT INTEREST RATE AND CURRENCY SWAPS, A HYPOTHETICAL DECREASE IN INTEREST RATES OF UP TO

1.0%

WOULD HAVE RESULTED IN AN INCREASE IN THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR INDEBTEDNESS OF APPROXIMATELY

$1.3 BILLION

AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2016

(AN INCREASE OF APPROXIMATELY

$1.6 BILLION

AS OF

DECEMBER 26, 2015

). THE FLUCTUATIONS IN FAIR VALUE OF OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO AND INDEBTEDNESS REFLECT ONLY THE DIRECT IMPACT OF THE CHANGE IN INTEREST RATES. OTHER ECONOMIC VARIABLES, SUCH AS EQUITY MARKET FLUCTUATIONS AND CHANGES IN RELATIVE CREDIT RISK, COULD RESULT IN A SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER FLUCTUATION IN THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR NET INVESTMENT POSITION.

EQUITY PRICES

OUR INVESTMENTS INCLUDE MARKETABLE EQUITY SECURITIES AND EQUITY DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS. WE TYPICALLY DO NOT ATTEMPT TO REDUCE OR ELIMINATE OUR EQUITY MARKET EXPOSURE THROUGH HEDGING ACTIVITIES AT THE INCEPTION OF OUR INVESTMENTS. BEFORE WE ENTER INTO HEDGE ARRANGEMENTS, WE EVALUATE LEGAL, MARKET, AND ECONOMIC FACTORS, AS WELL AS THE EXPECTED TIMING OF DISPOSAL, TO DETERMINE WHETHER HEDGING IS APPROPRIATE. OUR EQUITY MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT PROGRAM MAY INCLUDE EQUITY DERIVATIVES WITH OR WITHOUT HEDGE ACCOUNTING DESIGNATION THAT UTILIZE WARRANTS, EQUITY OPTIONS, OR OTHER EQUITY DERIVATIVES.

WE ALSO UTILIZE TOTAL RETURN SWAPS TO OFFSET CHANGES IN LIABILITIES RELATED TO THE EQUITY MARKET RISKS OF CERTAIN DEFERRED COMPENSATION ARRANGEMENTS. GAINS OR LOSSES FROM CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE OF THESE TOTAL RETURN SWAPS ARE GENERALLY OFFSET BY THE LOSSES OR GAINS ON THE RELATED LIABILITIES.

47

TABLE OF CONTENTS

AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2016

, THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR MARKETABLE EQUITY INVESTMENTS AND OUR EQUITY DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS, INCLUDING HEDGING POSITIONS, WAS

$6.2 BILLION

(

$6.0 BILLION

AS OF

DECEMBER 26, 2015

).

SUBSTANTIALLY ALL

OF OUR MARKETABLE EQUITY INVESTMENTS PORTFOLIO AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2016

WAS CONCENTRATED IN OUR INVESTMENT IN ASML OF

$6.1 BILLION

(

$5.7 BILLION

AS OF

DECEMBER 26, 2015

). OUR MARKETABLE EQUITY METHOD INVESTMENTS ARE EXCLUDED FROM OUR ANALYSIS, AS THE CARRYING VALUE DOES NOT FLUCTUATE BASED ON MARKET PRICE CHANGES UNLESS AN OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENT IS DEEMED NECESSARY. TO DETERMINE REASONABLY POSSIBLE DECREASES IN THE MARKET VALUE OF OUR MARKETABLE EQUITY INVESTMENTS, WE HAVE ANALYZED THE HISTORICAL MARKET PRICE SENSITIVITY OF OUR MARKETABLE EQUITY INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO. ASSUMING A DECLINE OF

30%

IN MARKET PRICES, AND AFTER REFLECTING THE IMPACT OF HEDGES AND OFFSETTING POSITIONS, THE AGGREGATE VALUE OF OUR MARKETABLE EQUITY INVESTMENTS COULD DECREASE BY APPROXIMATELY

$1.9 BILLION

, BASED ON THE VALUE AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2016

(A DECREASE IN VALUE OF APPROXIMATELY

$1.8 BILLION

, BASED ON THE VALUE AS OF

DECEMBER 26, 2015

USING AN ASSUMED DECLINE OF

30%

).

MANY OF THE SAME FACTORS THAT COULD RESULT IN AN ADVERSE MOVEMENT OF EQUITY MARKET PRICES AFFECT OUR NON-MARKETABLE EQUITY INVESTMENTS, ALTHOUGH WE CANNOT ALWAYS QUANTIFY THE IMPACT DIRECTLY. FINANCIAL MARKETS ARE VOLATILE, WHICH COULD NEGATIVELY AFFECT THE PROSPECTS OF THE COMPANIES WE INVEST IN, THEIR ABILITY TO RAISE ADDITIONAL CAPITAL, AND THE LIKELIHOOD OF OUR ABILITY TO REALIZE VALUE IN OUR INVESTMENTS THROUGH LIQUIDITY EVENTS SUCH AS INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERINGS, MERGERS, AND PRIVATE SALES. THESE TYPES OF INVESTMENTS INVOLVE A GREAT DEAL OF RISK, AND THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT ANY SPECIFIC COMPANY WILL GROW OR BECOME SUCCESSFUL; CONSEQUENTLY, WE COULD LOSE ALL OR PART OF OUR INVESTMENT. OUR NON-MARKETABLE COST METHOD EQUITY INVESTMENTS HAD A CARRYING AMOUNT OF

$3.1 BILLION

AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2016

(

$2.9 BILLION

AS OF

DECEMBER 26, 2015

) AND INCLUDED OUR INVESTMENT IN UNISPREADTRUM AND CLOUDERA, INC. (CLOUDERA) OF

$966 MILLION

AND

$454 MILLION

, RESPECTIVELY (

$966 MILLION

AND

$454 MILLION

FOR UNISPREADTRUM AND CLOUDERA, RESPECTIVELY, AS OF

DECEMBER 26, 2015

). THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF OUR NON-MARKETABLE EQUITY METHOD INVESTMENTS WAS

$1.3 BILLION

AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2016

(

$1.6 BILLION

AS OF

DECEMBER 26, 2015

).

A SUBSTANTIAL MAJORITY

OF OUR NON-MARKETABLE EQUITY METHOD INVESTMENTS BALANCE AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2016

WAS CONCENTRATED IN OUR IMFT AND CLOUDERA INVESTMENTS OF

$849 MILLION

AND

$225 MILLION

, RESPECTIVELY (

$872 MILLION

AND

$256 MILLION

FOR IMFT AND CLOUDERA, RESPECTIVELY, AS OF

DECEMBER 26, 2015

).

COMMODITY PRICE RISK

ALTHOUGH WE OPERATE FACILITIES THAT CONSUME COMMODITIES, WE ARE NOT DIRECTLY AFFECTED BY COMMODITY PRICE RISK TO A MATERIAL DEGREE. WE HAVE ESTABLISHED FORECASTED TRANSACTION RISK MANAGEMENT PROGRAMS TO PROTECT AGAINST FLUCTUATIONS IN COMMODITY PRICES. WE MAY USE COMMODITY DERIVATIVES CONTRACTS, SUCH AS COMMODITY SWAPS, IN THESE HEDGING PROGRAMS. IN ADDITION, WE HAVE SOURCING PLANS IN PLACE FOR OUR KEY COMMODITIES THAT MITIGATE THE RISK OF A POTENTIAL SUPPLIER CONCENTRATION.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND STOCKHOLDERS OF INTEL CORPORATION

WE HAVE AUDITED INTEL CORPORATION’S INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2016

, BASED ON CRITERIA ESTABLISHED IN INTERNAL CONTROL—INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK ISSUED BY THE COMMITTEE OF SPONSORING ORGANIZATIONS OF THE TREADWAY COMMISSION (

2013 FRAMEWORK

) (THE COSO CRITERIA). INTEL CORPORATION’S MANAGEMENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR MAINTAINING EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, AND FOR ITS ASSESSMENT OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING INCLUDED IN THE ACCOMPANYING MANAGEMENT REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING. OUR RESPONSIBILITY IS TO EXPRESS AN OPINION ON THE COMPANY’S INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING BASED ON OUR AUDIT.

WE CONDUCTED OUR AUDIT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE STANDARDS OF THE PUBLIC COMPANY ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BOARD (UNITED STATES). THOSE STANDARDS REQUIRE THAT WE PLAN AND PERFORM THE AUDIT TO OBTAIN REASONABLE ASSURANCE ABOUT WHETHER EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING WAS MAINTAINED IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS. OUR AUDIT INCLUDED OBTAINING AN UNDERSTANDING OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, ASSESSING THE RISK THAT A MATERIAL WEAKNESS EXISTS, TESTING AND EVALUATING THE DESIGN AND OPERATING EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL CONTROL BASED ON THE ASSESSED RISK, AND PERFORMING SUCH OTHER PROCEDURES AS WE CONSIDERED NECESSARY IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR AUDIT PROVIDES A REASONABLE BASIS FOR OUR OPINION.

A COMPANY’S INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING IS A PROCESS DESIGNED TO PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING THE RELIABILITY OF FINANCIAL REPORTING AND THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR EXTERNAL PURPOSES IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES. A COMPANY’S INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING INCLUDES THOSE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES THAT (1) PERTAIN TO THE MAINTENANCE OF RECORDS THAT, IN REASONABLE DETAIL, ACCURATELY AND FAIRLY REFLECT THE TRANSACTIONS AND DISPOSITIONS OF THE ASSETS OF THE COMPANY; (2) PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE THAT TRANSACTIONS ARE RECORDED AS NECESSARY TO PERMIT PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES, AND THAT RECEIPTS AND EXPENDITURES OF THE COMPANY ARE BEING MADE ONLY IN ACCORDANCE WITH AUTHORIZATIONS OF MANAGEMENT AND DIRECTORS OF THE COMPANY; AND (3) PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING PREVENTION OR TIMELY DETECTION OF UNAUTHORIZED ACQUISITION, USE, OR DISPOSITION OF THE COMPANY’S ASSETS THAT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

BECAUSE OF ITS INHERENT LIMITATIONS, INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING MAY NOT PREVENT OR DETECT MISSTATEMENTS. ALSO, PROJECTIONS OF ANY EVALUATION OF EFFECTIVENESS TO FUTURE PERIODS ARE SUBJECT TO THE RISK THAT CONTROLS MAY BECOME INADEQUATE BECAUSE OF CHANGES IN CONDITIONS, OR THAT THE DEGREE OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE POLICIES OR PROCEDURES MAY DETERIORATE.

IN OUR OPINION, INTEL CORPORATION MAINTAINED, IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS, EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2016

, BASED ON THE COSO CRITERIA.

WE ALSO HAVE AUDITED, IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE STANDARDS OF THE PUBLIC COMPANY ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BOARD (UNITED STATES), THE

2016

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF INTEL CORPORATION AND OUR REPORT DATED

FEBRUARY 17, 2017

, EXPRESSED AN UNQUALIFIED OPINION THEREON.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

INTEL CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 1: BASIS OF PRESENTATION

WE HAVE A 52- OR 53-WEEK FISCAL YEAR THAT ENDS ON THE LAST SATURDAY IN DECEMBER. FISCAL YEAR

2016

WAS A 53-WEEK FISCAL YEAR, AND THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2016 WAS A 14-WEEK QUARTER. FISCAL YEARS

2015

AND

2014

WERE 52-WEEK YEARS. OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDE THE ACCOUNTS OF INTEL CORPORATION (INTEL) AND OUR SUBSIDIARIES. WE HAVE ELIMINATED INTERCOMPANY ACCOUNTS AND TRANSACTIONS. WE HAVE RECLASSIFIED CERTAIN PRIOR PERIOD AMOUNTS TO CONFORM TO CURRENT PERIOD PRESENTATION.

USE OF ESTIMATES

THE PREPARATION OF CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN CONFORMITY WITH U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES (U.S. GAAP) REQUIRES US TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS THAT AFFECT THE AMOUNTS REPORTED IN OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND THE ACCOMPANYING NOTES. THE ACTUAL RESULTS THAT WE EXPERIENCE MAY DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM OUR ESTIMATES.

DURING OUR 2015 ANNUAL ASSESSMENT OF THE USEFUL LIVES OF OUR PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT, WE DETERMINED THAT THE ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES OF MACHINERY AND EQUIPMENT IN OUR WAFER FABRICATION FACILITIES SHOULD BE INCREASED FROM

4

TO

5

YEARS BASED ON THE LENGTHENING OF THE PROCESS TECHNOLOGY CADENCE RESULTING IN LONGER NODE TRANSITIONS ON BOTH 14 NANOMETER (NM) AND 10NM PRODUCTS. WE HAVE ALSO INCREASED THE RE-USE OF MACHINERY AND TOOLS ACROSS EACH GENERATION OF PROCESS TECHNOLOGY. THIS CHANGE IN ESTIMATE WAS APPLIED PROSPECTIVELY, EFFECTIVE AT THE BEGINNING OF 2016. DURING

2016

, THIS CHANGE INCREASED OUR OPERATING INCOME BY APPROXIMATELY

$1.3 BILLION

, OUR NET INCOME BY APPROXIMATELY

$950 MILLION

, AND OUR DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE BY APPROXIMATELY

$0.19.

NOTE 2: ACCOUNTING POLICIES

REVENUE RECOGNITION

WE RECOGNIZE NET PRODUCT REVENUE WHEN THE EARNINGS PROCESS IS COMPLETE, AS EVIDENCED BY AN AGREEMENT, DELIVERY HAS OCCURRED, PRICING IS DEEMED FIXED, AND COLLECTION IS CONSIDERED PROBABLE. WE RECORD PRICING ALLOWANCES, INCLUDING DISCOUNTS BASED ON CONTRACTUAL ARRANGEMENTS WITH CUSTOMERS, WHEN WE RECOGNIZE REVENUE AS A REDUCTION TO BOTH ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND NET REVENUE. BECAUSE OF FREQUENT SALES PRICE REDUCTIONS AND RAPID TECHNOLOGY OBSOLESCENCE IN OUR INDUSTRY, WE DEFER PRODUCT REVENUE AND RELATED COSTS OF SALES FROM COMPONENT SALES MADE TO DISTRIBUTORS UNDER AGREEMENTS ALLOWING PRICE PROTECTION OR RIGHT OF RETURN UNTIL THE DISTRIBUTORS SELL THE MERCHANDISE. THE RIGHT OF RETURN GRANTED GENERALLY CONSISTS OF A STOCK ROTATION PROGRAM IN WHICH DISTRIBUTORS ARE ABLE TO EXCHANGE CERTAIN PRODUCTS BASED ON THE NUMBER OF QUALIFIED PURCHASES MADE BY THE DISTRIBUTOR. UNDER THE PRICE PROTECTION PROGRAM, WE GIVE DISTRIBUTORS CREDITS FOR THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE ORIGINAL PRICE PAID AND THE CURRENT PRICE THAT WE OFFER. WE INCLUDE SHIPPING CHARGES BILLED TO CUSTOMERS IN NET REVENUE, AND INCLUDE THE RELATED SHIPPING COSTS IN COST OF SALES.

REVENUE FROM LICENSE AGREEMENTS ON OUR MCAFEE PRODUCTS GENERALLY INCLUDES SERVICE AND SUPPORT AGREEMENTS FOR WHICH THE RELATED REVENUE IS DEFERRED AND RECOGNIZED RATABLY OVER THE PERFORMANCE PERIOD IN WHICH SERVICES ARE PROVIDED. REVENUE DERIVED FROM ONLINE SUBSCRIPTION PRODUCTS IS DEFERRED AND RECOGNIZED RATABLY OVER THE PERFORMANCE PERIOD. PROFESSIONAL SERVICES REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED AS SERVICES ARE PERFORMED OR, IF REQUIRED, UPON CUSTOMER ACCEPTANCE. FOR ARRANGEMENTS WITH MULTIPLE ELEMENTS, INCLUDING SOFTWARE LICENSES, MAINTENANCE, AND/OR SERVICES, REVENUE IS ALLOCATED ACROSS THE SEPARATELY IDENTIFIED DELIVERABLES AND MAY BE RECOGNIZED OR DEFERRED. WHEN VENDOR-SPECIFIC OBJECTIVE EVIDENCE DOES NOT EXIST FOR UNDELIVERED ELEMENTS SUCH AS MAINTENANCE AND SUPPORT, THE ENTIRE ARRANGEMENT FEE IS RECOGNIZED RATABLY OVER THE PERFORMANCE PERIOD. DIRECT COSTS, SUCH AS COSTS RELATED TO REVENUE-SHARING AND ROYALTY ARRANGEMENTS ASSOCIATED WITH LICENSE ARRANGEMENTS, AS WELL AS COMPONENT COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH PRODUCT REVENUE AND SALES COMMISSIONS, ARE DEFERRED AND RECOGNIZED OVER THE SAME PERIOD THAT THE RELATED REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED.

INTEL CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

INVENTORIES

WE COMPUTE INVENTORY COST ON A FIRST-IN, FIRST-OUT BASIS. WE APPLY JUDGMENT IN THE VALUATION OF OUR INVENTORY WHICH INCLUDES THE FOLLOWING CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES.

INTEL HAS A PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT LIFE CYCLE THAT CORRESPONDS WITH SUBSTANTIVE ENGINEERING MILESTONES. THESE ENGINEERING MILESTONES ARE REGULARLY AND CONSISTENTLY APPLIED IN ASSESSING THE POINT AT WHICH OUR ACTIVITIES, AND ASSOCIATED COSTS, CHANGE IN NATURE FROM RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT (R&D) TO COST OF SALES. THIS IMPACTS THE TIMING OF WHEN MANUFACTURING COSTS CAN BE CAPITALIZED AS INVENTORY. FOR A PRODUCT TO BE MANUFACTURED IN HIGH VOLUMES AND SOLD TO OUR CUSTOMERS UNDER OUR STANDARD WARRANTY, IT MUST MEET OUR RIGOROUS TECHNICAL QUALITY SPECIFICATIONS. THIS MILESTONE IS KNOWN AS PRODUCT RELEASE QUALIFICATION (PRQ). WE HAVE IDENTIFIED PRQ AS THE POINT AT WHICH THE COSTS INCURRED TO MANUFACTURE OUR PRODUCTS ARE INCLUDED IN THE VALUATION OF INVENTORY. PRIOR TO PRQ, COSTS THAT DO NOT MEET THE CRITERIA FOR R&D ARE INCLUDED IN COST OF SALES IN THE PERIOD INCURRED. IF THE POINT AT WHICH WE ESTIMATE THAT INVENTORY MEETS PRQ CRITERIA CHANGES IN THE FUTURE, THE TIMING AND RECOGNITION OF THE MANUFACTURING COSTS WOULD SHIFT BETWEEN R&D AND COSTS OF SALES.

TO DETERMINE WHICH MANUFACTURING OVERHEAD COSTS CAN BE INCLUDED IN THE VALUATION OF INVENTORY, WE MUST DETERMINE WHAT NORMAL CAPACITY LEVELS ARE AT OUR MANUFACTURING AND ASSEMBLY AND TEST FACILITIES, BASED ON HISTORICAL LOADINGS COMPARED TO TOTAL AVAILABLE CAPACITY. IF THE FACTORY LOADINGS ARE BELOW THE ESTABLISHED NORMAL CAPACITY LEVEL, A PORTION OF OUR MANUFACTURING OVERHEAD COSTS WOULD NOT BE INCLUDED IN THE COST OF INVENTORY; THEREFORE, IT WOULD BE RECOGNIZED AS COST OF SALES IN THAT PERIOD, WHICH WOULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR GROSS MARGIN. WE REFER TO THESE COSTS AS EXCESS CAPACITY CHARGES.

INVENTORY IS VALUED AT THE LOWER OF COST OR MARKET, BASED UPON ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT FUTURE DEMAND AND MARKET CONDITIONS. PRODUCT-SPECIFIC FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES REVIEWED IN THE INVENTORY VALUATION PROCESS INCLUDE A REVIEW OF OUR CUSTOMER BASE, THE STAGE OF THE PRODUCT LIFE CYCLE OF OUR PRODUCTS, AND AN ASSESSMENT OF SELLING PRICE IN RELATION TO PRODUCT COST. INVENTORY RESERVES

INCREASED

BY APPROXIMATELY

$270 MILLION

IN

2016

COMPARED TO

2015.

THE VALUATION OF INVENTORY ALSO REQUIRES US TO ESTIMATE OBSOLETE AND EXCESS INVENTORY, AS WELL AS INVENTORY THAT IS NOT OF SALEABLE QUALITY. THE DEMAND FORECAST IS UTILIZED IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF OUR SHORT-TERM MANUFACTURING PLANS TO ENABLE CONSISTENCY BETWEEN INVENTORY VALUATIONS AND BUILD DECISIONS. THE ESTIMATE OF FUTURE DEMAND IS COMPARED TO WORK-IN-PROCESS AND FINISHED GOODS INVENTORY LEVELS TO DETERMINE THE AMOUNT, IF ANY, OF OBSOLETE OR EXCESS INVENTORY. IF OUR DEMAND FORECAST FOR SPECIFIC PRODUCTS IS GREATER THAN ACTUAL DEMAND AND WE FAIL TO REDUCE MANUFACTURING OUTPUT ACCORDINGLY, WE COULD BE REQUIRED TO WRITE OFF INVENTORY, WHICH WOULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR GROSS MARGIN.

PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT

WE COMPUTE DEPRECIATION USING THE STRAIGHT-LINE METHOD OVER THE ESTIMATED USEFUL LIFE OF THE ASSETS AND WE CAPITALIZE INTEREST ON BORROWINGS RELATED TO ELIGIBLE CAPITAL EXPENDITURES. CAPITALIZED INTEREST IS ADDED TO THE COST OF QUALIFIED ASSETS AND DEPRECIATED TOGETHER WITH THAT ASSET COST. WE RECORD CAPITAL-RELATED GOVERNMENT GRANTS EARNED AS A REDUCTION TO PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT.

WE APPLY JUDGMENT IN THE VALUATION OF OUR PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT, WHICH INCLUDES THE FOLLOWING CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES.

•

THE ESTIMATED ECONOMIC USEFUL LIVES OF OUR PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT CAN MATERIALLY IMPACT OUR DEPRECIATION EXPENSE. ACCORDINGLY, AT LEAST ANNUALLY, WE EVALUATE THE PERIOD OVER WHICH WE EXPECT TO RECOVER THE ECONOMIC VALUE OF THESE ASSETS, CONSIDERING FACTORS SUCH AS THE PROCESS TECHNOLOGY CADENCE BETWEEN NODE TRANSITIONS AND RE-USE OF MACHINERY AND TOOLS ACROSS EACH GENERATION OF PROCESS TECHNOLOGY. WE HAD A CHANGE IN ESTIMATE IN 2016 RELATED TO THE USEFUL LIVES OF MACHINERY AND EQUIPMENT IN OUR WAFER FABRICATION FACILITIES. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION, SEE "

NOTE 1: BASIS OF PRESENTATION

."

AS WE MAKE MANUFACTURING PROCESS CONVERSIONS AND OTHER FACTORY PLANNING DECISIONS, WE USE ASSUMPTIONS INVOLVING THE USE OF MANAGEMENT JUDGMENTS REGARDING THE REMAINING USEFUL LIVES OF ASSETS, PRIMARILY PROCESS-SPECIFIC SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING TOOLS AND BUILDING IMPROVEMENTS. WHEN WE DETERMINE THAT THE USEFUL LIVES OF ASSETS ARE SHORTER THAN WE HAD ORIGINALLY ESTIMATED, WE ACCELERATE THE RATE OF DEPRECIATION TO REFLECT THE ASSETS’ NEW, SHORTER USEFUL LIVES.

WE ASSESS PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT FOR IMPAIRMENT WHEN EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THAT THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE ASSETS OR THE ASSET GROUPING MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE. FACTORS THAT WE CONSIDER IN DECIDING WHEN TO PERFORM AN IMPAIRMENT REVIEW INCLUDE SIGNIFICANT UNDER-PERFORMANCE OF A BUSINESS OR PRODUCT LINE IN RELATION TO EXPECTATIONS, SIGNIFICANT NEGATIVE INDUSTRY OR ECONOMIC TRENDS, AND SIGNIFICANT CHANGES OR PLANNED CHANGES IN OUR USE OF THE ASSETS. WE MEASURE THE RECOVERABILITY OF ASSETS THAT WE WILL CONTINUE TO USE IN OUR OPERATIONS BY COMPARING THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE ASSET GROUPING TO OUR ESTIMATE OF THE RELATED TOTAL FUTURE UNDISCOUNTED NET CASH FLOWS ARISING FROM THE USE OF THAT ASSET GROUPING. IF AN ASSET GROUPING CARRYING VALUE IS NOT RECOVERABLE THROUGH THE RELATED UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS, THE ASSET GROUPING IS CONSIDERED TO BE IMPAIRED. WE MEASURE THE IMPAIRMENT BY COMPARING THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE ASSET GROUPING CARRYING VALUE AND ITS FAIR VALUE.

•

WE HAVE CERTAIN FACILITIES, INCLUDED WITHIN CONSTRUCTION IN PROGRESS, BEING HELD IN A SAFE STATE AND NOT CURRENTLY IN USE THAT WE HAVE PLANS TO PLACE INTO SERVICE AT A FUTURE DATE. THE TIME AT WHICH THESE ASSETS ARE PLACED INTO SERVICE DEPENDS ON OUR EXISTING MANUFACTURING CAPACITY, MARKET DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS, AND WHERE WE ARE IN THE TRANSITION OF PRODUCTS ON OUR ROADMAP. MANAGEMENT MAKES JUDGMENTS ABOUT THE TIMING OF WHEN THESE FACILITIES WILL BE READIED FOR THEIR INTENDED USE AND PLACED INTO SERVICE FOR THE MANUFACTURING OF OUR PRODUCTS. DEPRECIATION IS NOT RECOGNIZED ON THESE ASSETS AND THEY ARE NOT ELIGIBLE FOR CAPITALIZED INTEREST WHEN CONSTRUCTION IS ON HOLD.

FAIR VALUE

FAIR VALUE IS THE PRICE THAT WOULD BE RECEIVED FROM SELLING AN ASSET OR PAID TO TRANSFER A LIABILITY IN AN ORDERLY TRANSACTION BETWEEN MARKET PARTICIPANTS AT THE MEASUREMENT DATE. WHEN DETERMINING FAIR VALUE, WE CONSIDER THE PRINCIPAL OR MOST ADVANTAGEOUS MARKET IN WHICH WE WOULD TRANSACT, AND WE CONSIDER ASSUMPTIONS THAT MARKET PARTICIPANTS WOULD USE WHEN PRICING THE ASSET OR LIABILITY. OUR FINANCIAL ASSETS ARE MEASURED AND RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE, EXCEPT FOR COST METHOD INVESTMENTS, COST METHOD LOANS RECEIVABLE, EQUITY METHOD INVESTMENTS, GRANTS RECEIVABLE, AND REVERSE REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS WITH ORIGINAL MATURITIES GREATER THAN THREE MONTHS.

THE THREE LEVELS OF INPUTS THAT MAY BE USED TO MEASURE FAIR VALUE ARE.

•

LEVEL 1.

QUOTED PRICES IN ACTIVE MARKETS FOR IDENTICAL ASSETS OR LIABILITIES. WE EVALUATE SECURITY-SPECIFIC MARKET DATA WHEN DETERMINING WHETHER A MARKET IS ACTIVE.

•

LEVEL 2.

OBSERVABLE INPUTS OTHER THAN LEVEL 1 PRICES, SUCH AS QUOTED PRICES FOR SIMILAR ASSETS OR LIABILITIES, QUOTED PRICES IN LESS ACTIVE MARKETS, OR MODEL-DERIVED VALUATIONS. ALL SIGNIFICANT INPUTS USED IN OUR VALUATIONS, SUCH AS DISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS, ARE OBSERVABLE OR CAN BE DERIVED PRINCIPALLY FROM OR CORROBORATED WITH OBSERVABLE MARKET DATA FOR SUBSTANTIALLY THE FULL TERM OF THE ASSETS OR LIABILITIES. WE USE LIBOR-BASED YIELD CURVES, CURRENCY SPOT AND FORWARD RATES, AND CREDIT RATINGS AS SIGNIFICANT INPUTS IN OUR VALUATIONS. LEVEL 2 INPUTS ALSO INCLUDE NON-BINDING MARKET CONSENSUS PRICES AS WELL AS QUOTED PRICES THAT WERE ADJUSTED FOR SECURITY-SPECIFIC RESTRICTIONS. WHEN WE USE NON-BINDING MARKET CONSENSUS PRICES, WE CORROBORATE THEM WITH QUOTED MARKET PRICES FOR SIMILAR INSTRUMENTS OR COMPARE THEM TO OUTPUT FROM INTERNALLY DEVELOPED PRICING MODELS SUCH AS A DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW MODELS.

•

LEVEL 3.

UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS TO THE VALUATION METHODOLOGY THAT ARE SIGNIFICANT TO THE MEASUREMENT OF THE FAIR VALUE OF ASSETS OR LIABILITIES. WE MONITOR AND REVIEW THE INPUTS AND RESULTS OF THESE VALUATION MODELS TO HELP ENSURE THE FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS ARE REASONABLE AND CONSISTENT WITH MARKET EXPERIENCE IN SIMILAR ASSET CLASSES. LEVEL 3 INPUTS ALSO INCLUDE NON-BINDING MARKET CONSENSUS PRICES OR NON-BINDING BROKER QUOTES THAT WE WERE UNABLE TO CORROBORATE WITH OBSERVABLE MARKET DATA.

OUR POLICY IS TO REFLECT TRANSFERS BETWEEN THE FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY LEVELS AT THE BEGINNING OF THE PERIOD.

CASH EQUIVALENTS

WE CONSIDER ALL HIGHLY LIQUID DEBT INVESTMENTS WITH ORIGINAL MATURITIES FROM THE DATE OF PURCHASE OF THREE MONTHS OR LESS AS CASH EQUIVALENTS. CASH EQUIVALENTS CAN INCLUDE INVESTMENTS SUCH AS CORPORATE DEBT, FINANCIAL INSTITUTION INSTRUMENTS, GOVERNMENT DEBT, AND REVERSE REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS.

TRADING ASSETS

MARKETABLE DEBT INSTRUMENTS ARE GENERALLY DESIGNATED AS TRADING ASSETS WHEN A MARKET RISK IS ECONOMICALLY HEDGED AT INCEPTION WITH A RELATED DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENT, OR WHEN THE MARKETABLE DEBT INSTRUMENT ITSELF IS USED TO ECONOMICALLY HEDGE CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE RISK FROM REMEASUREMENT. INVESTMENTS DESIGNATED AS TRADING ASSETS ARE REPORTED AT FAIR VALUE. THE GAINS OR LOSSES ON THESE INVESTMENTS ARISING FROM CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE DUE TO INTEREST RATE AND CURRENCY MARKET FLUCTUATIONS AND CREDIT MARKET VOLATILITY, LARGELY OFFSET BY LOSSES OR GAINS ON THE RELATED DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND BALANCE SHEET REMEASUREMENT, ARE RECORDED IN INTEREST AND OTHER, NET. WE ALSO DESIGNATE CERTAIN FLOATING-RATE SECURITIZED FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, PRIMARILY ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES, AS TRADING ASSETS.

AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE INVESTMENTS

AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE INVESTMENTS ARE CLASSIFIED WITHIN CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS, SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS, OR LONG-TERM INVESTMENTS BASED ON THE REMAINING MATURITY OF THE INVESTMENT.

INVESTMENTS DESIGNATED AS AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE ARE REPORTED AT FAIR VALUE, WITH UNREALIZED GAINS OR LOSSES, NET OF TAX, RECORDED IN ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS), EXCEPT AS NOTED IN THE "OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENT" SECTION. WE DETERMINE THE COST OF THE INVESTMENT SOLD BASED ON AN AVERAGE COST BASIS AT THE INDIVIDUAL SECURITY LEVEL. OUR AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE INVESTMENTS INCLUDE.

MARKETABLE EQUITY SECURITIES

WHEN THERE IS NO PLAN TO SELL OR HEDGE THE INVESTMENT AT THE TIME OF ORIGINAL CLASSIFICATION. WE ACQUIRE THESE EQUITY INVESTMENTS TO PROMOTE BUSINESS AND STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES. WE RECORD THE REALIZED GAINS OR LOSSES ON THE SALE OR EXCHANGE OF MARKETABLE EQUITY SECURITIES IN GAINS (LOSSES) ON EQUITY INVESTMENTS, NET.

NON-MARKETABLE AND OTHER EQUITY INVESTMENTS

WE REGULARLY INVEST IN NON-MARKETABLE EQUITY INSTRUMENTS OF PRIVATE COMPANIES, WHICH RANGE FROM EARLY-STAGE COMPANIES THAT ARE OFTEN STILL DEFINING THEIR STRATEGIC DIRECTION TO MORE MATURE COMPANIES WITH ESTABLISHED REVENUE STREAMS AND BUSINESS MODELS.

EQUITY METHOD INVESTMENTS

WHEN WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO EXERCISE SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE, BUT NOT CONTROL, OVER THE INVESTEE. EQUITY METHOD INVESTMENTS INCLUDE MARKETABLE AND NON-MARKETABLE INVESTMENTS. OUR PROPORTIONATE SHARE OF THE INCOME OR LOSS IS RECOGNIZED ON A ONE-QUARTER LAG AND IS RECORDED IN GAINS (LOSSES) ON EQUITY INVESTMENTS, NET.

•

NON-MARKETABLE COST METHOD INVESTMENTS

WHEN THE EQUITY METHOD DOES NOT APPLY.

SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT IS REQUIRED TO IDENTIFY WHETHER AN IMPAIRMENT EXISTS IN THE VALUATION OF OUR NON-MARKETABLE EQUITY INVESTMENTS PORTFOLIO, AND THEREFORE WE CONSIDER THIS A CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATE. OUR QUARTERLY ANALYSIS CONSIDERS BOTH QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE FACTORS THAT MAY HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE INVESTEE'S FAIR VALUE. QUALITATIVE ANALYSIS OF OUR INVESTMENTS INVOLVES UNDERSTANDING THE FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE AND NEAR-TERM PROSPECTS OF THE INVESTEE, CHANGES IN GENERAL MARKET CONDITIONS IN THE INVESTEE’S INDUSTRY OR GEOGRAPHIC AREA, AND THE MANAGEMENT AND GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE OF THE INVESTEE. QUANTITATIVE ASSESSMENTS OF THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR INVESTMENTS ARE DEVELOPED USING THE MARKET AND INCOME APPROACHES. THE MARKET APPROACH INCLUDES THE USE OF COMPARABLE FINANCIAL METRICS OF PRIVATE AND PUBLIC COMPANIES AND RECENT FINANCING ROUNDS. THE INCOME APPROACH INCLUDES THE USE OF A DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW MODEL, WHICH REQUIRES SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES REGARDING THE INVESTEES' REVENUE, COSTS, AND DISCOUNT RATES. OUR ASSESSMENT OF THESE FACTORS IN DETERMINING WHETHER AN IMPAIRMENT EXISTS COULD CHANGE IN THE FUTURE DUE TO NEW DEVELOPMENTS OR CHANGES IN APPLIED ASSUMPTIONS.

DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

OUR PRIMARY OBJECTIVE FOR HOLDING DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS IS TO MANAGE CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE RISK AND INTEREST RATE RISK, AND, TO A LESSER EXTENT, EQUITY MARKET RISK, COMMODITY PRICE RISK, AND CREDIT RISK.

WE MAY ENTER INTO MASTER NETTING ARRANGEMENTS TO MITIGATE CREDIT RISK IN DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS BY PERMITTING NET SETTLEMENT OF TRANSACTIONS WITH THE SAME COUNTERPARTY.

A MASTER NETTING ARRANGEMENT MAY ALLOW COUNTERPARTIES TO NET SETTLE AMOUNTS OWED TO EACH OTHER AS A RESULT OF MULTIPLE, SEPARATE DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS. WE MAY ALSO ENTER INTO COLLATERAL SECURITY ARRANGEMENTS WITH CERTAIN OF OUR COUNTERPARTIES TO EXCHANGE CASH COLLATERAL WHEN THE NET FAIR VALUE OF CERTAIN DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS FLUCTUATES FROM CONTRACTUALLY ESTABLISHED THRESHOLDS. FOR PRESENTATION ON OUR CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS, WE DO NOT OFFSET FAIR VALUE AMOUNTS RECOGNIZED FOR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS UNDER MASTER NETTING ARRANGEMENTS. OUR DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS ARE PRESENTED AT FAIR VALUE ON A GROSS BASIS AND ARE INCLUDED IN OTHER CURRENT ASSETS, OTHER LONG-TERM ASSETS, OTHER ACCRUED LIABILITIES, OR OTHER LONG-TERM LIABILITIES.

THE AFTER-TAX GAINS OR LOSSES FROM THE EFFECTIVE PORTION OF A CASH FLOW HEDGE IS REPORTED AS A COMPONENT OF ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS) AND RECLASSIFIED INTO EARNINGS IN THE SAME PERIOD OR PERIODS IN WHICH THE HEDGED TRANSACTION AFFECTS EARNINGS, AND IN THE SAME LINE ITEM ON THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME AS THE IMPACT OF THE HEDGE TRANSACTION. FOR FOREIGN CURRENCY CONTRACTS HEDGING OUR CAPITAL PURCHASES, FORWARD POINTS ARE EXCLUDED FROM THE HEDGE EFFECTIVENESS ASSESSMENT. FOR OPTIONS, TIME VALUE IS GENERALLY EXCLUDED FROM THE HEDGE EFFECTIVENESS ASSESSMENT. INEFFECTIVE PORTIONS OF CASH FLOW HEDGES, AS WELL AS AMOUNTS EXCLUDED FROM THE HEDGE EFFECTIVENESS ASSESSMENT, ARE RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS IN INTEREST AND OTHER, NET. IF THE CASH FLOW HEDGE TRANSACTIONS BECOME PROBABLE NOT TO OCCUR, THE CORRESPONDING AMOUNTS DEFERRED IN ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS) WOULD BE IMMEDIATELY RECLASSIFIED TO INTEREST AND OTHER, NET. THESE DERIVATIVES ARE CLASSIFIED IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS IN THE SAME SECTION AS THE UNDERLYING ITEM.

FAIR VALUE HEDGES

WE MAY USE INTEREST RATE CONTRACTS, SUCH AS INTEREST RATE SWAPS, TO HEDGE AGAINST CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE ON CERTAIN OF OUR FIXED-RATE INDEBTEDNESS ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE CHANGES IN THE BENCHMARK INTEREST RATE. THE GAINS OR LOSSES ON THESE HEDGES, AS WELL AS THE OFFSETTING LOSSES OR GAINS RELATED TO THE CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE UNDERLYING HEDGED ITEM ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE HEDGED RISK, ARE RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS IN THE CURRENT PERIOD, PRIMARILY IN INTEREST AND OTHER, NET. THESE DERIVATIVES ARE CLASSIFIED IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS IN THE SAME SECTION AS THE UNDERLYING ITEM, PRIMARILY WITHIN CASH FLOWS FROM FINANCING ACTIVITIES.

NON-DESIGNATED HEDGES

WE MAY USE FOREIGN CURRENCY CONTRACTS TO ECONOMICALLY HEDGE THE FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY EQUIVALENT CASH FLOWS OF RECOGNIZED MONETARY ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, NON-U.S.-DOLLAR-DENOMINATED DEBT INSTRUMENTS CLASSIFIED AS TRADING ASSETS, AND NON-U.S.-DOLLAR-DENOMINATED LOANS RECEIVABLES RECOGNIZED AT FAIR VALUE. WE MAY ALSO USE INTEREST RATE CONTRACTS TO HEDGE INTEREST RATE RISK RELATED TO OUR U.S.-DOLLAR-DENOMINATED FIXED-RATE DEBT INSTRUMENTS CLASSIFIED AS TRADING ASSETS.

THE CHANGE IN FAIR VALUE OF THESE DERIVATIVES IS RECORDED THROUGH EARNINGS IN THE LINE ITEM ON THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME TO WHICH THE DERIVATIVES MOST CLOSELY RELATE, PRIMARILY IN INTEREST AND OTHER, NET. CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE UNDERLYING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ASSOCIATED WITH THE HEDGED RISK ARE GENERALLY OFFSET BY THE CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE RELATED DERIVATIVES.

WE MAY USE TOTAL RETURN SWAPS TO OFFSET CHANGES IN LIABILITIES RELATED TO THE EQUITY MARKET RISKS OF CERTAIN DEFERRED COMPENSATION ARRANGEMENTS. GAINS OR LOSSES FROM CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE OF TOTAL RETURN SWAPS ARE GENERALLY OFFSET BY THE LOSSES OR GAINS ON THE RELATED DEFERRED COMPENSATION LIABILITIES, BOTH OF WHICH ARE RECORDED IN COST OF SALES AND OPERATING EXPENSES. DEFERRED COMPENSATION LIABILITIES ARE INCLUDED IN OTHER ACCRUED LIABILITIES.

WE MAY USE WARRANTS, EQUITY OPTIONS, OR OTHER EQUITY DERIVATIVES AS PART OF OUR EQUITY MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT PROGRAM. WE RECOGNIZE CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF SUCH DERIVATIVES IN GAINS (LOSSES) ON EQUITY INVESTMENTS, NET.

THESE TYPES OF DERIVATIVES ARE EITHER CLASSIFIED IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS WITHIN CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES OR INVESTING ACTIVITIES, DEPENDING ON THE ACTIVITY THE EXPOSURE IS MOST CLOSELY ASSOCIATED WITH.

SECURITIES LENDING

WE MAY ENTER INTO SECURITIES LENDING AGREEMENTS WITH FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, GENERALLY TO FACILITATE HEDGING AND CERTAIN INVESTMENT AND FINANCING TRANSACTIONS. SELECTED SECURITIES MAY BE LOANED, SECURED BY COLLATERAL IN THE FORM OF CASH OR SECURITIES. THE LOANED SECURITIES CONTINUE TO BE CARRIED AS INVESTMENT ASSETS ON OUR CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS. FOR LENDING AGREEMENTS COLLATERALIZED BY CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS, COLLATERAL IS RECORDED AS AN ASSET WITH A CORRESPONDING LIABILITY. FOR LENDING AGREEMENTS COLLATERALIZED BY OTHER SECURITIES, WE DO NOT RECORD THE COLLATERAL AS AN ASSET OR A LIABILITY, UNLESS THE COLLATERAL IS REPLEDGED.

LOANS RECEIVABLE

WE MAY ENTER INTO LOAN TRANSACTIONS WITH THIRD PARTIES. THESE LOANS ARE CLASSIFIED WITHIN OTHER CURRENT ASSETS OR OTHER LONG-TERM ASSETS. WE MAY ELECT THE FAIR VALUE OPTION WHEN THE INTEREST RATE OR FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE RISK IS ECONOMICALLY HEDGED AT THE INCEPTION OF THE LOAN WITH A RELATED DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENT. WHEN THE FAIR VALUE OPTION IS NOT ELECTED, THE LOANS ARE CARRIED AT AMORTIZED COST. WE MEASURE INTEREST INCOME FOR ALL LOANS RECEIVABLE USING THE INTEREST METHOD, WHICH IS BASED ON THE EFFECTIVE YIELD OF THE LOANS RATHER THAN THE STATED COUPON RATE.

CREDIT RISK

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS THAT POTENTIALLY SUBJECT US TO CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK CONSIST PRINCIPALLY OF INVESTMENTS IN DEBT INSTRUMENTS, DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, LOANS RECEIVABLE, REVERSE REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS, AND TRADE RECEIVABLES.

WE MAY ENTER INTO MASTER NETTING ARRANGEMENTS TO MITIGATE CREDIT RISK IN DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS BY PERMITTING NET SETTLEMENT OF TRANSACTIONS WITH THE SAME COUNTERPARTY.

WE GENERALLY PLACE INVESTMENTS WITH HIGH-CREDIT-QUALITY COUNTERPARTIES AND, BY POLICY, WE LIMIT THE AMOUNT OF CREDIT EXPOSURE TO ANY ONE COUNTERPARTY BASED ON OUR ANALYSIS OF THAT COUNTERPARTY’S RELATIVE CREDIT STANDING. AS REQUIRED PER OUR INVESTMENT POLICY,

SUBSTANTIALLY ALL

OF OUR INVESTMENTS IN DEBT INSTRUMENTS AND FINANCING RECEIVABLES ARE IN INVESTMENT-GRADE INSTRUMENTS. CREDIT-RATING CRITERIA FOR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS ARE SIMILAR TO THOSE FOR OTHER INVESTMENTS. DUE TO MASTER NETTING ARRANGEMENTS, THE AMOUNTS SUBJECT TO CREDIT RISK RELATED TO DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS ARE GENERALLY LIMITED TO THE AMOUNTS, IF ANY, BY WHICH THE COUNTERPARTY’S OBLIGATIONS EXCEED OUR OBLIGATIONS WITH THAT COUNTERPARTY. AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2016

, OUR TOTAL CREDIT EXPOSURE TO ANY SINGLE COUNTERPARTY, EXCLUDING MONEY MARKET FUNDS INVESTED IN U.S. TREASURY AND U.S. AGENCY SECURITIES AND REVERSE REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS COLLATERALIZED BY TREASURY AND AGENCY SECURITIES, DID NOT EXCEED

$700 MILLION

. TO FURTHER REDUCE CREDIT RISK, WE OBTAIN AND SECURE AVAILABLE COLLATERAL FROM COUNTERPARTIES AGAINST OBLIGATIONS, INCLUDING SECURITIES LENDING TRANSACTIONS, WHEN WE DEEM IT APPROPRIATE.

A SUBSTANTIAL MAJORITY

OF OUR TRADE RECEIVABLES ARE DERIVED FROM SALES TO ORIGINAL EQUIPMENT MANUFACTURERS AND ORIGINAL DESIGN MANUFACTURERS. WE ALSO HAVE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE DERIVED FROM SALES TO INDUSTRIAL AND COMMUNICATIONS EQUIPMENT MANUFACTURERS IN THE COMPUTING AND COMMUNICATIONS INDUSTRIES. WE BELIEVE THAT THE NET ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE BALANCES FROM OUR THREE LARGEST CUSTOMERS (

31%

IN

2016

) DO NOT REPRESENT A SIGNIFICANT CREDIT RISK, BASED ON CASH FLOW FORECASTS, BALANCE SHEET ANALYSIS, AND PAST COLLECTION EXPERIENCE. FOR MORE INFORMATION ABOUT THE CUSTOMERS THAT REPRESENT OUR ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE BALANCE, SEE "

NOTE 4: OPERATING SEGMENTS AND GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION

" IN PART II, ITEM 8 OF THIS FORM 10-K.

WE HAVE ADOPTED CREDIT POLICIES AND STANDARDS INTENDED TO ACCOMMODATE INDUSTRY GROWTH AND INHERENT RISK. WE BELIEVE THAT CREDIT RISKS ARE MODERATED BY THE FINANCIAL STABILITY OF OUR MAJOR CUSTOMERS.

WE ASSESS CREDIT RISK THROUGH QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE ANALYSIS. FROM THIS ANALYSIS, WE ESTABLISH SHIPPING AND CREDIT LIMITS, AND DETERMINE WHETHER WE WILL SEEK TO USE ONE OR MORE CREDIT SUPPORT PROTECTION DEVICES, SUCH AS OBTAINING A PARENT GUARANTEE, STANDBY LETTER OF CREDIT, OR CREDIT INSURANCE.

BUSINESS COMBINATIONS

WE ALLOCATE THE PURCHASE PRICE PAID FOR ASSETS ACQUIRED AND LIABILITIES ASSUMED IN CONNECTION WITH OUR ACQUISITIONS BASED ON THEIR ESTIMATED FAIR VALUES AT THE TIME OF ACQUISITION. WE CONSIDER THIS A CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATE BECAUSE IT INVOLVES A NUMBER OF ASSUMPTIONS, ESTIMATES, AND JUDGMENTS THAT COULD MATERIALLY AFFECT THE TIMING OR AMOUNTS RECOGNIZED IN OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. THE MOST SUBJECTIVE AREAS INCLUDE DETERMINING THE FAIR VALUE OF THE FOLLOWING.

•

INTANGIBLE ASSETS, INCLUDING VALUATION METHODOLOGY, ESTIMATIONS OF FUTURE CASH FLOWS, AND DISCOUNT RATES, AS WELL AS THE ESTIMATED USEFUL LIFE OF THE INTANGIBLE ASSETS;

•

DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS, AND TAX-RELATED VALUATION ALLOWANCES, WHICH ARE INITIALLY ESTIMATED AS OF THE ACQUISITION DATE;

•

INVENTORY; PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT; PRE-EXISTING LIABILITIES OR LEGAL CLAIMS; DEFERRED REVENUE; AND CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION, EACH AS MAY BE APPLICABLE; AND

•

GOODWILL AS MEASURED AS THE EXCESS OF CONSIDERATION TRANSFERRED OVER THE NET OF THE ACQUISITION DATE FAIR VALUES OF THE ASSETS ACQUIRED AND THE LIABILITIES ASSUMED.

OUR ASSUMPTIONS AND ESTIMATES ARE BASED UPON COMPARABLE MARKET DATA AND INFORMATION OBTAINED FROM OUR MANAGEMENT AND THE MANAGEMENT OF THE ACQUIRED COMPANIES. WE ALLOCATE GOODWILL TO THE REPORTING UNITS OF THE BUSINESS THAT ARE EXPECTED TO BENEFIT FROM THE BUSINESS COMBINATION.

GOODWILL

APPLICATION OF THE GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT TEST IS CONSIDERED A CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATE, INCLUDING THE IDENTIFICATION OF REPORTING UNITS, ASSIGNMENT OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES TO REPORTING UNITS, ASSIGNMENT OF GOODWILL TO REPORTING UNITS, AND DETERMINATION OF FAIR VALUE FOR EACH REPORTING UNIT.

WE PERFORM AN ANNUAL IMPAIRMENT ASSESSMENT OF GOODWILL IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF EACH YEAR, OR MORE FREQUENTLY IF INDICATORS OF POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT EXIST, WHICH INCLUDES EVALUATING QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE FACTORS TO ASSESS THE LIKELIHOOD OF AN IMPAIRMENT OF A REPORTING UNIT’S GOODWILL. THE REPORTING UNIT’S CARRYING VALUE USED IN AN IMPAIRMENT TEST REPRESENTS THE ASSIGNMENT OF VARIOUS ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, EXCLUDING CERTAIN CORPORATE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, SUCH AS CASH, INVESTMENTS, AND DEBT. FOR REPORTING UNITS IN WHICH THIS ASSESSMENT CONCLUDES THAT IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT THE FAIR VALUE IS MORE THAN ITS CARRYING VALUE, GOODWILL IS NOT CONSIDERED IMPAIRED AND WE ARE NOT REQUIRED TO PERFORM THE TWO-STEP GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT TEST.

QUALITATIVE FACTORS CONSIDERED IN THIS ASSESSMENT INCLUDE INDUSTRY AND MARKET CONSIDERATIONS, OVERALL FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE, AND OTHER RELEVANT EVENTS AND FACTORS AFFECTING THE REPORTING UNIT. ADDITIONALLY, AS PART OF THIS ASSESSMENT, WE MAY PERFORM A QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS TO SUPPORT THE QUALITATIVE FACTORS ABOVE BY APPLYING SENSITIVITIES TO ASSUMPTIONS AND INPUTS USED IN MEASURING A REPORTING UNIT’S FAIR VALUE. FOR REPORTING UNITS IN WHICH THE IMPAIRMENT ASSESSMENT CONCLUDES THAT IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT THE FAIR VALUE IS LESS THAN ITS CARRYING VALUE, WE PERFORM THE FIRST STEP OF THE GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT TEST, WHICH COMPARES THE FAIR VALUE OF THE REPORTING UNIT TO ITS CARRYING VALUE. IF THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE NET ASSETS ASSIGNED TO THE REPORTING UNIT EXCEEDS THE FAIR VALUE OF THE REPORTING UNIT, THEN WE MUST PERFORM THE SECOND STEP OF THE GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT TEST TO DETERMINE THE IMPLIED FAIR VALUE OF THE REPORTING UNIT’S GOODWILL.

OUR GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT TEST CONSIDERS BOTH THE INCOME METHOD AND THE MARKET METHOD TO ESTIMATE A REPORTING UNIT’S FAIR VALUE. THE INCOME METHOD IS BASED ON A DISCOUNTED FUTURE CASH FLOW APPROACH THAT USES THE FOLLOWING MAJOR ASSUMPTIONS AND INPUTS: REVENUE, BASED ON ASSUMED MARKET SEGMENT GROWTH RATES AND OUR ASSUMED MARKET SEGMENT SHARE; ESTIMATED COSTS; AND APPROPRIATE DISCOUNT RATES BASED ON A REPORTING UNIT'S WEIGHTED AVERAGE COST OF CAPITAL AS DETERMINED BY CONSIDERING THE OBSERVABLE WEIGHTED AVERAGE COST OF CAPITAL OF COMPARABLE COMPANIES. OUR ESTIMATES OF MARKET SEGMENT GROWTH, OUR MARKET SEGMENT SHARE, AND COSTS ARE BASED ON HISTORICAL DATA, VARIOUS INTERNAL ESTIMATES, AND A VARIETY OF EXTERNAL SOURCES. THE SAME ESTIMATES ARE ALSO USED IN OUR BUSINESS PLANNING AND FORECASTING PROCESS. WE TEST THE REASONABLENESS OF THE INPUTS AND OUTCOMES OF OUR DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW ANALYSIS AGAINST AVAILABLE COMPARABLE MARKET DATA. THE MARKET METHOD IS BASED ON FINANCIAL MULTIPLES AND TRANSACTION PRICES OF COMPARABLE COMPANIES. ALTHOUGH THERE WERE NO SPECIFIC QUALITATIVE INDICATORS OF IMPAIRMENT FOR OUR REPORTING UNITS, WE ELECTED TO PERFORM A STEP 1 IMPAIRMENT TEST IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF

2016

. THESE REPORTING UNITS WERE ALL DEEMED TO HAVE FAIR VALUES THAT SUBSTANTIALLY EXCEEDED THEIR CARRYING VALUE.

UPON ANY REORGANIZATION OF OUR OPERATING SEGMENTS, WE RE-EVALUATE OUR REPORTING UNITS AND, IF NECESSARY, REASSIGN GOODWILL USING A RELATIVE FAIR VALUE APPROACH.

IDENTIFIED INTANGIBLE ASSETS

WE AMORTIZE ALL ACQUISITION-RELATED INTANGIBLE ASSETS THAT ARE SUBJECT TO AMORTIZATION OVER THEIR ESTIMATED USEFUL LIFE BASED ON ECONOMIC BENEFIT. ACQUISITION-RELATED IN-PROCESS R&D ASSETS REPRESENT THE FAIR VALUE OF INCOMPLETE R&D PROJECTS THAT HAD NOT REACHED TECHNOLOGICAL FEASIBILITY AS OF THE DATE OF ACQUISITION; INITIALLY, THESE ARE CLASSIFIED AS "IN-PROCESS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT" THAT ARE NOT SUBJECT TO AMORTIZATION. ONCE THESE R&D PROJECTS ARE COMPLETED, THE ASSET BALANCES ARE TRANSFERRED FROM "IN-PROCESS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT" TO "ACQUISITION-RELATED DEVELOPED TECHNOLOGY" AND ARE SUBJECT TO AMORTIZATION FROM THIS POINT FORWARD. THE ASSET BALANCES RELATING TO PROJECTS THAT ARE ABANDONED AFTER ACQUISITION ARE IMPAIRED AND EXPENSED TO R&D.

WE PERFORM A QUARTERLY REVIEW OF SIGNIFICANT FINITE–LIVED IDENTIFIED INTANGIBLE ASSETS TO DETERMINE WHETHER FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THAT THE USEFUL LIFE IS SHORTER THAN WE HAD ORIGINALLY ESTIMATED OR THAT THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF ASSETS MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE. WE CONSIDER THE ASSUMPTIONS AND ESTIMATES USED TO DETERMINE FUTURE VALUES AND REMAINING USEFUL LIVES OF OUR INTANGIBLE AND OTHER LONG-LIVED ASSETS A CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATE. THEY CAN BE AFFECTED BY VARIOUS FACTORS, INCLUDING EXTERNAL FACTORS SUCH AS INDUSTRY AND ECONOMIC TRENDS, AND INTERNAL FACTORS SUCH AS CHANGES IN OUR BUSINESS STRATEGY AND OUR FORECASTS FOR SPECIFIC PRODUCT LINES.

OUR ANNUAL IMPAIRMENT ASSESSMENT OCCURS IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF EACH YEAR FOR INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS, OR MORE FREQUENTLY IF INDICATORS OF POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT EXIST, TO DETERMINE WHETHER IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE ASSETS MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE. IF NECESSARY, A QUANTITATIVE IMPAIRMENT TEST IS PERFORMED TO COMPARE THE FAIR VALUE OF THE INDEFINITE–LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSET WITH ITS CARRYING VALUE. IMPAIRMENTS, IF ANY, ARE BASED ON THE EXCESS OF THE CARRYING AMOUNT OVER THE FAIR VALUE OF THOSE ASSETS.

UPON EXERCISE, CANCELLATION, FORFEITURE, OR EXPIRATION OF STOCK OPTIONS, OR UPON VESTING OR FORFEITURE OF RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS (RSUS), WE ELIMINATE DEFERRED TAX ASSETS FOR OPTIONS AND RSUS WITH MULTIPLE VESTING DATES FOR EACH VESTING PERIOD ON A FIRST-IN, FIRST-OUT BASIS AS IF EACH VESTING PERIOD WERE A SEPARATE AWARD.

INCOME TAXES

WE COMPUTE THE PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES USING THE ASSET AND LIABILITY METHOD, UNDER WHICH DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE RECOGNIZED FOR THE EXPECTED FUTURE TAX CONSEQUENCES OF TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE FINANCIAL REPORTING AND TAX BASES OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, AND FOR OPERATING LOSSES AND TAX CREDIT CARRYFORWARDS. WE MEASURE DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES USING THE CURRENTLY ENACTED TAX RATES THAT APPLY TO TAXABLE INCOME IN EFFECT FOR THE YEARS IN WHICH THOSE TAX ASSETS ARE EXPECTED TO BE REALIZED OR SETTLED.

WE APPLY JUDGMENT IN THE RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT OF CURRENT AND DEFERRED INCOME TAXES WHICH INCLUDES THE FOLLOWING CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES. WE ASSESS THE LIKELIHOOD THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO RECOVER OUR DEFERRED TAX ASSETS. IF RECOVERY IS NOT LIKELY, WE MUST INCREASE OUR PROVISION FOR TAXES BY RECORDING A VALUATION ALLOWANCE AGAINST THE DEFERRED TAX ASSETS THAT WE ESTIMATE WILL NOT ULTIMATELY BE RECOVERABLE. WE BELIEVE THAT WE WILL ULTIMATELY RECOVER THE DEFERRED TAX ASSETS RECORDED ON OUR CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS. RECOVERY OF A PORTION OF OUR DEFERRED TAX ASSETS IS IMPACTED BY MANAGEMENT’S PLANS WITH RESPECT TO HOLDING OR DISPOSING OF CERTAIN INVESTMENTS; THEREFORE, CHANGES IN MANAGEMENT’S PLANS WITH RESPECT TO HOLDING OR DISPOSING OF INVESTMENTS COULD AFFECT OUR FUTURE PROVISION FOR TAXES.

WE USE A TWO-STEP PROCESS TO RECOGNIZE LIABILITIES FOR UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS. THE FIRST STEP IS TO EVALUATE THE TAX POSITION FOR RECOGNITION BY DETERMINING WHETHER, BASED ON THE TECHNICAL MERITS OF THE POSITION, THE WEIGHT OF AVAILABLE EVIDENCE INDICATES THAT IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT THE POSITION WILL BE SUSTAINED ON EXAMINATION BY THE TAXING AUTHORITIES, INCLUDING RESOLUTION OF RELATED APPEALS OR LITIGATION PROCESSES, IF ANY. IF WE DETERMINE THAT A TAX POSITION WILL MORE LIKELY THAN NOT BE SUSTAINED ON EXAMINATION, THE SECOND STEP REQUIRES US TO ESTIMATE AND MEASURE THE TAX BENEFIT AS THE LARGEST AMOUNT THAT IS MORE THAN

50%

LIKELY TO BE REALIZED UPON ULTIMATE SETTLEMENT. WE CONSIDER MANY FACTORS WHEN EVALUATING AND ESTIMATING OUR TAX POSITIONS AND TAX BENEFITS, WHICH MAY REQUIRE PERIODIC ADJUSTMENTS AND MAY NOT ACCURATELY FORECAST ACTUAL OUTCOMES. WE RECOGNIZE INTEREST AND PENALTIES RELATED TO UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS WITHIN THE PROVISION FOR TAXES ON THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME. DETERMINING WHETHER AN UNCERTAIN TAX POSITION IS EFFECTIVELY SETTLED REQUIRES JUDGMENT. SUCH A CHANGE IN RECOGNITION OR MEASUREMENT WOULD RESULT IN THE RECOGNITION OF A TAX BENEFIT OR AN ADDITIONAL CHARGE TO THE TAX PROVISION.

WE HAVE NOT RECOGNIZED U.S. DEFERRED INCOME TAXES ON CERTAIN UNDISTRIBUTED NON-U.S. EARNINGS BECAUSE WE PLAN TO INDEFINITELY REINVEST SUCH EARNINGS OUTSIDE THE U.S. REMITTANCES OF NON-U.S. EARNINGS ARE BASED ON ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS OF PROJECTED CASH FLOW NEEDS, AS WELL AS THE WORKING CAPITAL AND INVESTMENT REQUIREMENTS OF OUR NON-U.S. AND U.S. OPERATIONS. MATERIAL CHANGES IN OUR ESTIMATES OF CASH, WORKING CAPITAL, AND INVESTMENT NEEDS IN VARIOUS JURISDICTIONS COULD REQUIRE REPATRIATION OF INDEFINITELY REINVESTED NON-U.S. EARNINGS, WHICH WOULD BE SUBJECT TO U.S. INCOME TAXES AND APPLICABLE NON-U.S. INCOME AND WITHHOLDING TAXES.

LOSS CONTINGENCIES

WE ARE SUBJECT TO LOSS CONTINGENCIES, INCLUDING VARIOUS LEGAL AND REGULATORY PROCEEDINGS, ASSERTED AND POTENTIAL CLAIMS, LIABILITIES RELATED TO REPAIR OR REPLACEMENT OF PARTS IN CONNECTION WITH PRODUCT DEFECTS, AS WELL AS PRODUCT WARRANTIES AND POTENTIAL ASSET IMPAIRMENTS THAT ARISE IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS. AN ESTIMATED LOSS FROM SUCH CONTINGENCIES IS RECOGNIZED AS A CHARGE TO INCOME IF IT IS PROBABLE THAT A LIABILITY HAS BEEN INCURRED AND THE AMOUNT OF THE LOSS CAN BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED. JUDGMENT IS REQUIRED IN BOTH THE DETERMINATION OF PROBABILITY AND THE DETERMINATION AS TO WHETHER A LOSS IS REASONABLY ESTIMABLE AS A CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATE. WE REVIEW THE STATUS OF EACH SIGNIFICANT MATTER QUARTERLY AND WE MAY REVISE OUR ESTIMATES.

NOTE 3: RECENT ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

ACCOUNTING STANDARDS ADOPTED

STANDARD/DESCRIPTION

EFFECTIVE DATE AND ADOPTION CONSIDERATIONS

EFFECT ON FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OR OTHER SIGNIFICANT MATTERS

INCOME TAXES - BALANCE SHEET CLASSIFICATION OF DEFERRED TAXES

. THIS AMENDED STANDARD REQUIRES THAT WE CLASSIFY ALL DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AS NON-CURRENT ON THE BALANCE SHEET INSTEAD OF SEPARATING DEFERRED TAXES INTO CURRENT AND NON-CURRENT.

THIS AMENDED STANDARD WAS EARLY ADOPTED IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2016 ON A RETROSPECTIVE BASIS.

AS A RESULT OF THE ADOPTION, WE MADE THE FOLLOWING ADJUSTMENTS TO THE CONSOLIDATED 2015 BALANCE SHEET: A $2.0 BILLION DECREASE TO CURRENT DEFERRED TAX ASSETS, A $430 MILLION INCREASE TO NON-CURRENT DEFERRED TAX ASSETS, A $21 MILLION DECREASE TO CURRENT DEFERRED TAX LIABILITIES, AND A DECREASE OF $1.6 BILLION TO NON-CURRENT DEFERRED TAX LIABILITIES.

ACCOUNTING STANDARDS NOT YET ADOPTED

STANDARD/DESCRIPTION

EFFECTIVE DATE AND ADOPTION CONSIDERATIONS

EFFECT ON FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OR OTHER SIGNIFICANT MATTERS

REVENUE RECOGNITION - CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS.

THIS STANDARD WAS ISSUED TO ACHIEVE A CONSISTENT APPLICATION OF REVENUE RECOGNITION WITHIN THE U.S., RESULTING IN A SINGLE REVENUE MODEL TO BE APPLIED BY REPORTING COMPANIES UNDER U.S. GAAP. UNDER THE NEW MODEL, RECOGNITION OF REVENUE OCCURS WHEN A CUSTOMER OBTAINS CONTROL OF PROMISED GOODS OR SERVICES IN AN AMOUNT THAT REFLECTS THE CONSIDERATION TO WHICH THE ENTITY EXPECTS TO BE ENTITLED IN EXCHANGE FOR THOSE GOODS OR SERVICES. IN ADDITION, THE NEW STANDARD REQUIRES THAT REPORTING COMPANIES DISCLOSE THE NATURE, AMOUNT, TIMING, AND UNCERTAINTY OF REVENUE AND CASH FLOWS ARISING FROM CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS.

EFFECTIVE IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2018.

WE PLAN TO ADOPT THE STANDARD RETROSPECTIVELY WITH THE CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF INITIALLY APPLYING IT RECOGNIZED AT THE DATE OF INITIAL APPLICATION ("MODIFIED RETROSPECTIVE" APPROACH).

OUR ASSESSMENT HAS IDENTIFIED A CHANGE IN REVENUE RECOGNITION TIMING ON OUR COMPONENT SALES MADE TO DISTRIBUTORS. WE EXPECT TO RECOGNIZE REVENUE WHEN WE DELIVER TO THE DISTRIBUTOR RATHER THAN DEFERRING RECOGNITION UNTIL THE DISTRIBUTOR SELLS THE COMPONENTS.

ON THE DATE OF INITIAL APPLICATION, WE WILL REMOVE THE DEFERRED NET REVENUE ON COMPONENT SALES MADE TO DISTRIBUTORS THROUGH A CUMULATIVE ADJUSTMENT TO RETAINED EARNINGS. WE EXPECT THE REVENUE DEFERRAL, HISTORICALLY RECOGNIZED IN THE FOLLOWING PERIOD, TO BE OFFSET BY THE ACCELERATION OF REVENUE RECOGNITION AS CONTROL OF THE PRODUCT TRANSFERS TO OUR CUSTOMER.

OUR ASSESSMENT HAS ALSO IDENTIFIED A CHANGE IN EXPENSE RECOGNITION TIMING RELATED TO PAYMENTS WE MAKE TO OUR CUSTOMERS FOR DISTINCT SERVICES THEY PERFORM AS PART OF COOPERATIVE ADVERTISING PROGRAMS. WE EXPECT TO RECOGNIZE THE EXPENSE FOR COOPERATIVE ADVERTISING IN THE PERIOD THE MARKETING ACTIVITIES OCCUR. WE CURRENTLY RECOGNIZE THE EXPENSE IN THE PERIOD THE CUSTOMER IS ENTITLED TO PARTICIPATE IN THE PROGRAM, WHICH COINCIDES WITH THE PERIOD OF SALE.

ON THE DATE OF INITIAL ADOPTION, WE WILL CAPITALIZE THE EXPENSE OF COOPERATIVE ADVERTISING NOT PERFORMED THROUGH A CUMULATIVE ADJUSTMENT TO RETAINED EARNINGS. WE EXPECT THE RECOGNITION OF CAPITALIZED ADVERTISING TO OFFSET THE DECELERATION IN EXPENSE RECOGNITION UNTIL THE MARKETING SERVICES ARE PERFORMED.

WE WILL CONTINUE OUR ASSESSMENT, OPERATE PARALLEL SYSTEMS AND PROCESSES, AS WELL AS FINALIZE OUR EVALUATION OF ANY CHANGES TO OUR ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND DISCLOSURES. THIS EXCLUDES OUR PLANNED DIVESTITURE OF INTEL SECURITY GROUP (ISECG).

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS - RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT.

REQUIRES CHANGES TO THE ACCOUNTING FOR FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS THAT PRIMARILY AFFECT EQUITY INVESTMENTS, FINANCIAL LIABILITIES MEASURED USING THE FAIR VALUE OPTION, AND THE PRESENTATION AND DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS FOR SUCH INSTRUMENTS.

EFFECTIVE IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2018.

CERTAIN ELEMENTS OF THE NEW STANDARD ARE REQUIRED TO BE ADOPTED USING A MODIFIED-RETROSPECTIVE APPROACH THROUGH A CUMULATIVE-EFFECT ADJUSTMENT TO THE BALANCE SHEET AS OF THE BEGINNING OF THE FISCAL YEAR OF ADOPTION. OTHER ELEMENTS WILL BE ADOPTED PROSPECTIVELY.

WE EXPECT MARKETABLE EQUITY SECURITIES, PREVIOUSLY CLASSIFIED AS AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE EQUITY INVESTMENTS, TO BE MEASURED AND RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE AND ALL UNREALIZED GAINS OR LOSSES PREVIOUSLY RECORDED IN ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS) WILL BE RECORDED IN EARNINGS.

WE ARE CONTINUING TO ASSESS THE OVERALL IMPACTS OF THE NEW STANDARD, INCLUDING THE IMPACT TO OUR SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES WITH REGARD TO NON-MARKETABLE EQUITY SECURITIES CLASSIFIED AS COST METHOD INVESTMENTS.

INCOME TAXES - INTRA-ENTITY ASSET TRANSFERS OTHER THAN INVENTORY

. THIS ACCOUNTING STANDARD UPDATE IS AIMED AT RECOGNIZING THE INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES OF INTRA-ENTITY TRANSFERS OF ASSETS OTHER THAN INVENTORY WHEN THEY OCCUR. THIS REMOVES THE EXCEPTION TO POSTPONE RECOGNITION UNTIL THE ASSET HAS BEEN SOLD TO AN OUTSIDE PARTY.

EFFECTIVE IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2018.

THE STANDARD UPDATE IS REQUIRED TO BE APPLIED ON A MODIFIED RETROSPECTIVE BASIS THROUGH A CUMULATIVE-EFFECT ADJUSTMENT TO THE BALANCE SHEET AS OF THE BEGINNING OF THE FISCAL YEAR OF ADOPTION.

WE HAVE NOT YET DETERMINED THE IMPACT OF THE NEW STANDARD.

LEASES

. THIS NEW LEASE ACCOUNTING STANDARD REQUIRES THAT WE RECOGNIZE LEASE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ON THE BALANCE SHEET.

EFFECTIVE IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019.

THE NEW STANDARD MUST BE ADOPTED USING A MODIFIED RETROSPECTIVE TRANSITION THAT INCLUDES CERTAIN OPTIONAL PRACTICAL EXPEDIENTS.

WE EXPECT THE VALUATION OF RIGHT OF USE ASSETS AND LEASE LIABILITIES, PREVIOUSLY DESCRIBED AS OPERATING LEASES, TO BE THE PRESENT VALUE OF OUR FORECASTED FUTURE LEASE COMMITMENTS. WE ARE CONTINUING TO ASSESS THE OVERALL IMPACTS OF THE NEW STANDARD, INCLUDING THE DISCOUNT RATE TO BE APPLIED IN THESE VALUATIONS.

THE CHIEF OPERATING DECISION MAKER (CODM) IS OUR CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER (CEO). THE CODM ALLOCATES RESOURCES TO AND ASSESSES THE PERFORMANCE OF EACH OPERATING SEGMENT USING INFORMATION ABOUT ITS REVENUE AND OPERATING INCOME (LOSS).

WE MANAGE OUR BUSINESS ACTIVITIES PRIMARILY BASED ON A PRODUCT SEGMENTATION BASIS. WE DERIVE A SUBSTANTIAL MAJORITY OF OUR REVENUE FROM PLATFORMS, WHICH IS OUR PRINCIPAL PRODUCT AND SOURCE OF REVENUE ACROSS OUR CCG, DCG, AND IOTG OPERATING SEGMENTS.

CCG AND DCG ARE OUR REPORTABLE OPERATING SEGMENTS. IOTG, NSG, ISECG, AND PSG DO NOT MEET THE QUANTITATIVE THRESHOLDS TO QUALIFY AS REPORTABLE OPERATING SEGMENTS; HOWEVER, WE HAVE ELECTED TO DISCLOSE THE RESULTS OF THESE NON-REPORTABLE OPERATING SEGMENTS. THE NTG OPERATING SEGMENT DOES NOT MEET THE QUANTITATIVE THRESHOLDS TO QUALIFY AS A REPORTABLE SEGMENT AND NTG RESULTS ARE INCLUDED WITHIN THE "ALL OTHER" CATEGORY.

WE HAVE SALES AND MARKETING, MANUFACTURING, ENGINEERING, FINANCE, AND ADMINISTRATION GROUPS. EXPENSES FOR THESE GROUPS ARE GENERALLY ALLOCATED TO THE OPERATING SEGMENTS.

THE "ALL OTHER" CATEGORY INCLUDES REVENUE AND EXPENSES SUCH AS.

INTEL CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

THE CODM DOES NOT EVALUATE OPERATING SEGMENTS USING DISCRETE ASSET INFORMATION. BASED ON THE INTERCHANGEABLE NATURE OF OUR MANUFACTURING AND ASSEMBLY AND TEST ASSETS, MOST OF THE RELATED DEPRECIATION EXPENSE IS NOT DIRECTLY IDENTIFIABLE WITHIN OUR OPERATING SEGMENTS, AS IT IS INCLUDED IN OVERHEAD COST POOLS AND SUBSEQUENTLY ABSORBED INTO INVENTORY AS EACH PRODUCT PASSES THROUGH OUR MANUFACTURING PROCESS. AS OUR PRODUCTS ARE THEN SOLD ACROSS MULTIPLE OPERATING SEGMENTS, IT IS IMPRACTICABLE TO DETERMINE THE TOTAL DEPRECIATION EXPENSE INCLUDED AS A COMPONENT OF EACH OPERATING SEGMENT’S OPERATING INCOME (LOSS) RESULTS. OPERATING SEGMENTS DO NOT RECORD INTER-SEGMENT REVENUE. WE DO NOT ALLOCATE GAINS AND LOSSES FROM EQUITY INVESTMENTS, INTEREST AND OTHER INCOME, OR TAXES TO OPERATING SEGMENTS. ALTHOUGH THE CODM USES OPERATING INCOME TO EVALUATE THE SEGMENTS, OPERATING COSTS INCLUDED IN ONE SEGMENT MAY BENEFIT OTHER SEGMENTS. EXCEPT FOR THESE DIFFERENCES, THE ACCOUNTING POLICIES FOR SEGMENT REPORTING ARE THE SAME AS FOR INTEL AS A WHOLE.

POTENTIALLY DILUTIVE SHARES OF COMMON STOCK FROM EMPLOYEE INCENTIVE PLANS ARE DETERMINED BY APPLYING THE TREASURY STOCK METHOD TO THE ASSUMED EXERCISE OF OUTSTANDING STOCK OPTIONS, THE ASSUMED VESTING OF OUTSTANDING RSUS, AND THE ASSUMED ISSUANCE OF COMMON STOCK UNDER THE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN. POTENTIALLY DILUTIVE SHARES OF COMMON STOCK FOR OUR 2005 DEBENTURES ARE DETERMINED BY APPLYING THE IF-CONVERTED METHOD. HOWEVER, AS OUR 2009 DEBENTURES REQUIRE SETTLEMENT OF THE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF THE DEBT IN CASH UPON CONVERSION, WITH THE CONVERSION PREMIUM PAID IN CASH OR STOCK AT OUR OPTION, POTENTIALLY DILUTIVE SHARES OF COMMON STOCK ARE DETERMINED BY APPLYING THE TREASURY STOCK METHOD.

IN ALL YEARS PRESENTED,

POTENTIALLY DILUTIVE SECURITIES WHOSE EFFECT WOULD HAVE BEEN ANTIDILUTIVE ARE INSIGNIFICANT AND ARE EXCLUDED FROM THE COMPUTATION OF DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE.

IN ALL YEARS PRESENTED, WE

INCLUDED

OUR 2009 DEBENTURES IN THE CALCULATION OF DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE OF COMMON STOCK BECAUSE THE AVERAGE MARKET PRICE WAS ABOVE THE CONVERSION PRICE. WE COULD POTENTIALLY EXCLUDE THE 2009 DEBENTURES IN THE FUTURE IF THE AVERAGE MARKET PRICE IS BELOW THE CONVERSION PRICE.

THE MAJORITY OF THE

IN OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE IN

2016

COMPARED TO

2015

WAS DRIVEN BY

ONE-TIME ITEMS AND OUR 2015 DECISION TO INDEFINITELY REINVEST SOME OF OUR PRIOR YEARS' NON-U.S. EARNINGS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER PROPORTION OF OUR INCOME IN LOWER TAX JURISDICTIONS.

MOST OF THE

DECREASE

IN OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE IN

2015

COMPARED TO

2014

WAS DRIVEN BY

ONE-TIME ITEMS, A HIGHER PROPORTION OF OUR INCOME FROM LOWER TAX JURISDICTIONS, AND OUR DECISION TO INDEFINITELY REINVEST CERTAIN PRIOR YEARS' NON-U.S. EARNINGS, WHICH POSITIVELY IMPACTED OUR EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE.

INCOME IN CERTAIN NON-U.S. COUNTRIES IS FULLY EXEMPT FROM INCOME TAXES FOR A LIMITED PERIOD OF TIME DUE TO ELIGIBLE ACTIVITIES AND CERTAIN CAPITAL INVESTMENT ACTIONS. THESE FULL TAX EXEMPTIONS EXPIRE AT VARIOUS DATES THROUGH

2023

OUR TAX POLICY IS TO COMPLY WITH THE LAWS, REGULATIONS, AND FILING REQUIREMENTS OF ALL JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH WE CONDUCT BUSINESS. WE REGULARLY ENGAGE IN DISCUSSIONS AND NEGOTIATIONS WITH TAX AUTHORITIES REGARDING TAX MATTERS IN VARIOUS JURISDICTIONS. ALTHOUGH THE TIMING OF THE RESOLUTIONS AND/OR CLOSURES OF AUDITS IS HIGHLY UNCERTAIN, IT IS REASONABLY POSSIBLE THAT CERTAIN U.S. FEDERAL AND NON-U.S. TAX AUDITS MAY BE CONCLUDED WITHIN THE NEXT 12 MONTHS, WHICH COULD SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE OR DECREASE THE BALANCE OF OUR GROSS UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS. HOWEVER, THE ESTIMATED IMPACT OF INCOME TAX EXPENSE AND NET INCOME IS NOT EXPECTED TO BE SIGNIFICANT.

WE FILE FEDERAL, STATE, AND NON-U.S. TAX RETURNS. FOR NON-U.S. TAX RETURNS, WE ARE GENERALLY NO LONGER SUBJECT TO TAX EXAMINATIONS FOR YEARS PRIOR TO

2002

. FOR FEDERAL AND STATE TAX RETURNS, WE ARE NO LONGER SUBJECT TO TAX EXAMINATION FOR YEARS PRIOR TO

2004

. WE HAVE FILED PETITIONS BEFORE THE U.S. TAX COURT RELATING TO THE TREATMENT OF STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE IN AN INTER-COMPANY COST-SHARING TRANSACTION FOR CERTAIN PRE-ACQUISITION ALTERA TAX YEARS; THE OUTCOME OF THOSE APPEALS IS PENDING IN THE U.S. COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT.

IM FLASH TECHNOLOGIES, LLC

SINCE THE INCEPTION OF IM FLASH TECHNOLOGIES, LLC (IMFT) IN 2006, MICRON TECHNOLOGY, INC. (MICRON) AND INTEL HAVE JOINTLY DEVELOPED NAND FLASH MEMORY AND, MOST RECENTLY, 3D XPOINT TECHNOLOGY PRODUCTS. INTEL ALSO PURCHASES JOINTLY DEVELOPED PRODUCTS DIRECTLY FROM MICRON UNDER CERTAIN SUPPLY AGREEMENTS.

THE IMFT OPERATING AGREEMENT, MOST RECENTLY AMENDED IN JANUARY 2016, CONTINUES THROUGH 2024 UNLESS EARLIER TERMINATED UNDER CERTAIN TERMS AND CONDITIONS, AND PROVIDES FOR CERTAIN BUY-SELL RIGHTS OF THE JOINT VENTURE. INTEL HAS THE RIGHT TO CAUSE MICRON TO BUY OUR INTEREST IN IMFT. IF WE EXERCISE THIS RIGHT, MICRON WOULD SET THE CLOSING DATE OF THE TRANSACTION WITHIN TWO YEARS FOLLOWING SUCH ELECTION AND COULD ELECT TO RECEIVE FINANCING FROM US FOR ONE TO TWO YEARS. SUBSEQUENT TO OUR PUT RIGHT, AND COMMENCING IN JANUARY 2019, MICRON HAS THE RIGHT TO CALL OUR INTEREST IN IMFT WITH THE CLOSING DATE TO BE EFFECTIVE WITHIN ONE YEAR.

IMFT IS A VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITY, AND ALL COSTS OF IMFT ARE PASSED ON TO MICRON AND INTEL THROUGH SALE OF PRODUCTS OR SERVICES IN PROPORTIONAL SHARE OF OWNERSHIP. OUR PORTION OF IMFT COSTS, PRIMARILY RELATED TO PRODUCT PURCHASES AND PRODUCTION-RELATED SERVICES, WAS APPROXIMATELY

$400 MILLION

IN

2016

(APPROXIMATELY

$400 MILLION

IN

2015

AND APPROXIMATELY

$400 MILLION

IN

2014

). THE AMOUNT DUE TO IMFT FOR PRODUCT PURCHASES AND SERVICES PROVIDED WAS APPROXIMATELY

$95 MILLION

AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2016

(APPROXIMATELY

$20 MILLION

AS OF

DECEMBER 26, 2015

). IMFT RETURNED

$71 MILLION

TO INTEL IN

2016

, WHICH IS REFLECTED WITHIN INVESTING ACTIVITIES ON THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS (

NONE

IN

2015

AND

$6 MILLION

IN

2014

).

IMFT DEPENDS ON MICRON AND INTEL FOR ANY ADDITIONAL CASH NEEDS. OUR KNOWN MAXIMUM EXPOSURE TO LOSS APPROXIMATED THE CARRYING VALUE OF OUR INVESTMENT BALANCE IN IMFT, WHICH WAS

$849 MILLION

AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2016

. EXCEPT FOR THE AMOUNT DUE TO IMFT FOR PRODUCT PURCHASES AND PRODUCTION-RELATED SERVICES, WE DID NOT HAVE ANY ADDITIONAL LIABILITIES RECOGNIZED ON OUR CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS IN CONNECTION WITH OUR INTERESTS IN THIS JOINT VENTURE AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2016

. OUR POTENTIAL FUTURE LOSSES COULD BE HIGHER THAN THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF OUR INVESTMENT, AS INTEL AND MICRON ARE LIABLE FOR OTHER FUTURE OPERATING COSTS OR OBLIGATIONS OF IMFT. FUTURE CASH CALLS COULD ALSO INCREASE OUR INVESTMENT BALANCE AND THE RELATED EXPOSURE TO LOSS. IN ADDITION, BECAUSE WE ARE CURRENTLY COMMITTED TO PURCHASING

49%

OF IMFT’S PRODUCTION OUTPUT AND PRODUCTION-RELATED SERVICES, WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO PURCHASE PRODUCTS AT A COST IN EXCESS OF REALIZABLE VALUE.

WE HAVE DETERMINED THAT WE DO NOT HAVE THE CHARACTERISTICS OF A CONSOLIDATING INVESTOR IN THE VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITY AND, THEREFORE, WE ACCOUNT FOR OUR INTEREST IN IMFT USING THE EQUITY METHOD OF ACCOUNTING.

CLOUDERA, INC.

OUR INVESTMENT IN CLOUDERA, INC. (CLOUDERA) IS ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER THE EQUITY AND COST METHODS OF ACCOUNTING BASED ON THE RIGHTS ASSOCIATED WITH DIFFERENT INSTRUMENTS WE OWN, AND IS CLASSIFIED WITHIN OTHER LONG-TERM ASSETS. THE CARRYING VALUE OF OUR EQUITY METHOD INVESTMENT WAS

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION, SEE "

DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2016, WE ELECTED TO SEPARATELY DISCLOSE THE RESULTS OF ISECG AND DETERMINED SSG WAS NO LONGER AN OPERATING SEGMENT; ACCORDINGLY, ITS GOODWILL WAS RE-ALLOCATED TO OTHER OPERATING SEGMENTS BASED ON THE RELATIVE FAIR VALUE. ADDITIONALLY, WE FORMED NTG, WHICH INCLUDES PRODUCTS DESIGNED FOR WEARABLES, CAMERAS, DRONES, AND OTHER MARKET SEGMENTS. THE SUBSTANTIAL MAJORITY OF GOODWILL UNDER "ALL OTHER" IS ATTRIBUTABLE TO NTG, THE REMAINDER OF WHICH IS UNALLOCATED FROM ACQUISITIONS COMPLETED IN 2016. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION, SEE "

EMPLOYEES HIRED ON OR AFTER JANUARY 1, 2011 RECEIVE DISCRETIONARY EMPLOYER CONTRIBUTIONS IN THE INTEL 401(K) SAVINGS PLAN, WHICH ARE PARTICIPANT-DIRECTED. OUR CEO DETERMINES THE ANNUAL DISCRETIONARY EMPLOYER CONTRIBUTION AMOUNTS FOR THE U.S. INTEL RETIREMENT CONTRIBUTION PLAN AND THE INTEL 401(K) SAVINGS PLAN UNDER DELEGATION OF AUTHORITY FROM OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS, PURSUANT TO THE TERMS OF THE PLANS. EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2015, THE U.S. INTEL RETIREMENT CONTRIBUTION PLAN ASSETS AND FUTURE DISCRETIONARY EMPLOYER CONTRIBUTIONS ARE PARTICIPANT-DIRECTED.

FOR THE BENEFIT OF ELIGIBLE U.S. EMPLOYEES, WE ALSO PROVIDE A NON-TAX-QUALIFIED SUPPLEMENTAL DEFERRED COMPENSATION PLAN FOR CERTAIN HIGHLY COMPENSATED EMPLOYEES. THIS PLAN IS DESIGNED TO PERMIT CERTAIN DISCRETIONARY EMPLOYER CONTRIBUTIONS AND TO PERMIT EMPLOYEES TO DEFER A PORTION OF COMPENSATION IN ADDITION TO THEIR INTEL 401(K) SAVINGS PLAN DEFERRALS. THIS PLAN IS UNFUNDED.

WE EXPENSED

$326 MILLION

FOR THE QUALIFIED AND NON-QUALIFIED U.S. RETIREMENT CONTRIBUTION PLANS IN

2016

(

$337 MILLION

IN

2015

AND

$286 MILLION

IN

2014

). IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF

2017

, WE FUNDED

$314 MILLION

FOR THE

2016

CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE QUALIFIED U.S. RETIREMENT CONTRIBUTION PLANS.

PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS

U.S. PENSION BENEFITS.

FOR EMPLOYEES HIRED PRIOR TO JANUARY 1, 2011, WE PROVIDE A TAX-QUALIFIED DEFINED-BENEFIT PENSION PLAN, THE U.S. INTEL MINIMUM PENSION PLAN, FOR ELIGIBLE EMPLOYEES, FORMER EMPLOYEES, AND RETIREES IN THE U.S. BEGINNING ON JANUARY 1, 2015, FUTURE BENEFIT ACCRUALS IN THE U.S. INTEL MINIMUM PENSION PLAN WERE FROZEN TO ALL EMPLOYEES AT OR ABOVE A SPECIFIC GRADE LEVEL, AND GENERALLY COVERING ALL HIGHLY COMPENSATED EMPLOYEES IN THE PLAN. BEGINNING IN 2016, THE IMPACTED EMPLOYEES RECEIVED DISCRETIONARY EMPLOYER CONTRIBUTIONS IN THE INTEL 401(K) SAVINGS PLAN, INSTEAD OF THE U.S. INTEL RETIREMENT CONTRIBUTION PLAN. THIS CHANGE WAS CONTINGENT ON RECEIVING A FAVORABLE PRIVATE LETTER RULING FROM THE U.S. INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE (IRS), WHICH WE RECEIVED IN OCTOBER 2014. AS A RESULT, OUR PROJECTED BENEFIT OBLIGATION WAS REDUCED BY

$1.1 BILLION

IN 2014, MOST OF WHICH WAS ALSO INCLUDED AS A CHANGE IN ACTUARIAL VALUATION ON THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF COMPREHENSIVE INCOME.

THE U.S. INTEL MINIMUM PENSION PLAN BENEFIT IS DETERMINED BY A PARTICIPANT’S YEARS OF SERVICE AND FINAL AVERAGE COMPENSATION, AS DEFINED BY THE PLAN DOCUMENT. THE PLAN GENERATES A MINIMUM PENSION BENEFIT IF THE PARTICIPANT'S U.S. INTEL MINIMUM PENSION PLAN BENEFIT EXCEEDS THE ANNUITIZED VALUE OF THE EMPLOYEE'S U.S. INTEL RETIREMENT CONTRIBUTION PLAN BENEFIT. IF PARTICIPANT BALANCES IN THE U.S. INTEL RETIREMENT CONTRIBUTION PLAN DO NOT GROW SUFFICIENTLY, THE PROJECTED BENEFIT OBLIGATION OF THE U.S. INTEL MINIMUM PENSION PLAN COULD INCREASE SIGNIFICANTLY. CONSISTENT WITH APPLICABLE LAW, ASSETS OF THE U.S. INTEL MINIMUM PENSION PLAN ARE HELD IN TRUST, SOLELY FOR THE BENEFIT OF PLAN PARTICIPANTS, AND ARE NOT AVAILABLE FOR GENERAL CORPORATE PURPOSES.

NON-U.S. PENSION BENEFITS.

WE ALSO PROVIDE DEFINED-BENEFIT PENSION PLANS IN CERTAIN OTHER COUNTRIES, MOST SIGNIFICANTLY IRELAND, GERMANY, AND ISRAEL. CONSISTENT WITH THE REQUIREMENTS OF LOCAL LAW, WE DEPOSIT FUNDS FOR CERTAIN PLANS WITH INSURANCE COMPANIES, WITH THIRD-PARTY TRUSTEES, OR INTO GOVERNMENT-MANAGED ACCOUNTS, AND/OR ACCRUE FOR THE UNFUNDED PORTION OF THE OBLIGATION.

U.S. POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL BENEFITS.

UPON RETIREMENT, ELIGIBLE U.S. EMPLOYEES WHO WERE HIRED PRIOR TO JANUARY 1, 2014 ARE CREDITED WITH A DEFINED DOLLAR AMOUNT, BASED ON YEARS OF SERVICE, INTO A U.S. SHELTERED EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT MEDICAL ACCOUNT (SERMA). THESE CREDITS CAN BE USED TO PAY ALL OR A PORTION OF THE COST TO PURCHASE COVERAGE IN THE RETIREE’S CHOICE OF MEDICAL PLAN. IF THE AVAILABLE CREDITS ARE NOT SUFFICIENT TO PAY THE ENTIRE COST OF THE COVERAGE, THE REMAINING COST IS THE RETIREE’S RESPONSIBILITY. EMPLOYEES HIRED ON OR AFTER JANUARY 1, 2014 ARE NOT ELIGIBLE TO EARN A SERMA BENEFIT.

FUNDING POLICY.

OUR PRACTICE IS TO FUND THE VARIOUS PENSION PLANS IN AMOUNTS SUFFICIENT TO MEET THE MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS OF APPLICABLE LOCAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS. ADDITIONAL FUNDING MAY BE PROVIDED AS DEEMED APPROPRIATE. FUNDING FOR THE U.S. POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL BENEFITS PLAN IS DISCRETIONARY UNDER APPLICABLE LAWS AND REGULATIONS; ADDITIONAL FUNDING MAY BE PROVIDED AS DEEMED APPROPRIATE. DEPENDING ON THE DESIGN OF THE PLAN, LOCAL CUSTOMS, AND MARKET CIRCUMSTANCES, THE LIABILITIES OF A PLAN MAY EXCEED QUALIFIED PLAN ASSETS.

WE USE A CORRIDOR APPROACH TO AMORTIZE ACTUARIAL GAINS AND LOSSES. UNDER THIS APPROACH, NET ACTUARIAL GAINS OR LOSSES IN EXCESS OF 10% OF THE LARGER OF THE PROJECTED BENEFIT OBLIGATION OR THE FAIR VALUE OF PLAN ASSETS ARE AMORTIZED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS. THE PERIOD OF AMORTIZATION IS THE AVERAGE REMAINING SERVICE OF ACTIVE PARTICIPANTS WHO ARE EXPECTED TO RECEIVE BENEFITS UNDER THE PLANS.

FOR THE U.S. PLANS, WE DEVELOPED THE DISCOUNT RATE BY CALCULATING THE BENEFIT PAYMENT STREAMS BY YEAR TO DETERMINE WHEN BENEFIT PAYMENTS WILL BE DUE. WE THEN MATCHED THE BENEFIT PAYMENT STREAMS BY YEAR TO THE AA CORPORATE BOND RATES TO MATCH THE TIMING AND AMOUNT OF THE EXPECTED BENEFIT PAYMENTS, AND DISCOUNTED BACK TO THE MEASUREMENT DATE TO DETERMINE THE APPROPRIATE DISCOUNT RATE. FOR THE NON-U.S. PLANS, WE USED TWO APPROACHES TO DEVELOP THE DISCOUNT RATE. IN CERTAIN COUNTRIES, WE USED A MODEL CONSISTING OF A THEORETICAL BOND PORTFOLIO FOR WHICH THE TIMING AND AMOUNT OF CASH FLOWS APPROXIMATED THE ESTIMATED BENEFIT PAYMENTS OF OUR PENSION PLANS. IN OTHER COUNTRIES, WE ANALYZED CURRENT MARKET LONG-TERM BOND RATES AND MATCHED THE BOND MATURITY WITH THE AVERAGE DURATION OF THE PENSION LIABILITIES.

WE ESTABLISH THE LONG-TERM EXPECTED RATE OF RETURN BY DEVELOPING A FORWARD-LOOKING, LONG-TERM RETURN ASSUMPTION FOR EACH PENSION FUND ASSET CLASS, TAKING INTO ACCOUNT FACTORS SUCH AS THE EXPECTED REAL RETURN FOR THE SPECIFIC ASSET CLASS AND INFLATION. A SINGLE, LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN IS THEN CALCULATED AS THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE OF THE TARGET ASSET ALLOCATION PERCENTAGES AND THE LONG-TERM RETURN ASSUMPTION FOR EACH ASSET CLASS.

THE ALLOCATION TO EACH ASSET CLASS WILL FLUCTUATE WITH MARKET CONDITIONS, SUCH AS VOLATILITY AND LIQUIDITY CONCERNS, AND WILL TYPICALLY BE REBALANCED WHEN OUTSIDE THE TARGET RANGES, WHICH WERE

CONCENTRATIONS OF RISK

WE MANAGE A VARIETY OF RISKS, INCLUDING CREDIT, LIQUIDITY, AND MARKET RISKS, ACROSS OUR PLAN ASSETS THROUGH OUR INVESTMENT MANAGERS. WE DEFINE A CONCENTRATION OF RISK AS AN UNDIVERSIFIED EXPOSURE TO ONE OF THE AFOREMENTIONED RISKS THAT UNNECESSARILY INCREASES THE EXPOSURE TO A LOSS OF PLAN ASSETS. WE MONITOR EXPOSURE TO SUCH RISKS IN BOTH THE U.S. AND NON-U.S. PLANS BY MONITORING THE MAGNITUDE OF THE RISK IN EACH PLAN AND DIVERSIFYING OUR EXPOSURE TO SUCH RISKS ACROSS A VARIETY OF COUNTERPARTIES, INSTRUMENTS, AND MARKETS.

NOTE 19: EMPLOYEE EQUITY INCENTIVE PLANS

OUR EQUITY INCENTIVE PLANS ARE BROAD-BASED, LONG-TERM PROGRAMS INTENDED TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN TALENTED EMPLOYEES AND ALIGN STOCKHOLDER AND EMPLOYEE INTERESTS.

UNDER THE 2006 EQUITY INCENTIVE PLAN (THE 2006 PLAN),

753 MILLION

SHARES OF COMMON STOCK ARE AUTHORIZED FOR ISSUANCE AS EQUITY AWARDS TO EMPLOYEES AND NON-EMPLOYEE DIRECTORS THROUGH JUNE 2018. AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2016

,

216.5 MILLION

SHARES OF COMMON STOCK REMAINED AVAILABLE FOR ISSUANCE UNDER THE 2006 PLAN.

IN CONNECTION WITH OUR COMPLETED ACQUISITION OF ALTERA IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2016, WE ASSUMED TWO EQUITY INCENTIVE PLANS WITH OUTSTANDING UNVESTED STOCK OPTIONS AND RSUS. THE ASSUMED STOCK OPTIONS AND RSUS GENERALLY RETAINED THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH THEY WERE ORIGINALLY GRANTED. WE WILL NOT GRANT ADDITIONAL SHARES UNDER THESE ASSUMED PLANS.

WE GRANT RSUS WITH BOTH A MARKET CONDITION AND A SERVICE CONDITION (MARKET-BASED RSUS), REFERRED TO IN OUR PROXY STATEMENT AS OUTPERFORMANCE STOCK UNITS (OSUS), TO A GROUP OF SENIOR OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, AND NON-EMPLOYEE DIRECTORS. FOR OSUS GRANTED IN

2016

, THE NUMBER OF SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK TO BE RECEIVED AT VESTING WILL RANGE FROM

0%

TO

200%

OF THE TARGET AMOUNT, BASED ON TOTAL STOCKHOLDER RETURN (TSR) ON OUR COMMON STOCK MEASURED AGAINST THE BENCHMARK TSR OF A PEER GROUP OVER A

THREE

-YEAR PERIOD. TSR IS A MEASURE OF STOCK PRICE APPRECIATION PLUS ANY DIVIDENDS PAID IN THIS PERFORMANCE PERIOD. AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2016

,

6.7 MILLION

OSUS WERE OUTSTANDING. THESE OSUS ACCRUE DIVIDEND EQUIVALENTS AND GENERALLY VEST THREE YEARS AND ONE MONTH FROM THE GRANT DATE. RSU AND OPTION AWARDS GENERALLY VEST OVER

FOUR

YEARS FROM THE GRANT DATE. STOCK OPTIONS GENERALLY EXPIRE

SEVEN

YEARS FROM THE DATE OF GRANT.

THE 2006 STOCK PURCHASE PLAN ALLOWS ELIGIBLE EMPLOYEES TO PURCHASE SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK AT

85%

OF THE VALUE OF OUR COMMON STOCK ON SPECIFIC DATES. UNDER THE 2006 STOCK PURCHASE PLAN,

373 MILLION

SHARES OF COMMON STOCK ARE AUTHORIZED FOR ISSUANCE THROUGH AUGUST 2021. AS OF

GOVERNMENT COMPETITION MATTERS AND CONSUMER CLASS ACTIONS

IN 2001, THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION (EC) COMMENCED AN INVESTIGATION REGARDING CLAIMS BY ADVANCED MICRO DEVICES, INC. (AMD) THAT WE USED UNFAIR BUSINESS PRACTICES TO PERSUADE CUSTOMERS TO BUY OUR MICROPROCESSORS. WE RECEIVED NUMEROUS REQUESTS FOR INFORMATION AND DOCUMENTS FROM THE EC AND WE RESPONDED TO EACH OF THOSE REQUESTS. THE EC ISSUED A STATEMENT OF OBJECTIONS IN JULY 2007 AND HELD A HEARING ON THAT STATEMENT IN MARCH 2008. THE EC ISSUED A SUPPLEMENTAL STATEMENT OF OBJECTIONS IN JULY 2008. IN MAY 2009, THE EC ISSUED A DECISION FINDING THAT WE HAD VIOLATED ARTICLE 82 OF THE EC TREATY AND ARTICLE 54 OF THE EUROPEAN ECONOMIC AREA AGREEMENT. IN GENERAL, THE EC FOUND THAT WE VIOLATED ARTICLE 82 (LATER RENUMBERED AS ARTICLE 102 BY A NEW TREATY) BY OFFERING ALLEGED "CONDITIONAL REBATES AND PAYMENTS" THAT REQUIRED OUR CUSTOMERS TO PURCHASE ALL OR MOST OF THEIR X86 MICROPROCESSORS FROM US. THE EC ALSO FOUND THAT WE VIOLATED ARTICLE 82 BY MAKING ALLEGED "PAYMENTS TO PREVENT SALES OF SPECIFIC RIVAL PRODUCTS." THE EC IMPOSED A FINE IN THE AMOUNT OF

€1.1 BILLION

(

$1.4 BILLION

AS OF MAY 2009), WHICH WE SUBSEQUENTLY PAID DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2009, AND ORDERED US TO "IMMEDIATELY BRING TO AN END THE INFRINGEMENT REFERRED TO IN" THE EC DECISION.

THE EC DECISION CONTAINED NO SPECIFIC DIRECTION ON WHETHER OR HOW WE SHOULD MODIFY OUR BUSINESS PRACTICES. INSTEAD, THE DECISION STATED THAT WE SHOULD "CEASE AND DESIST" FROM FURTHER CONDUCT THAT, IN THE EC'S OPINION, WOULD VIOLATE APPLICABLE LAW. WE TOOK STEPS, WHICH ARE SUBJECT TO THE EC'S ONGOING REVIEW, TO COMPLY WITH THAT DECISION PENDING APPEAL. WE HAD DISCUSSIONS WITH THE EC TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE DECISION AND TO EXPLAIN CHANGES TO OUR BUSINESS PRACTICES.

WE APPEALED THE EC DECISION TO THE COURT OF FIRST INSTANCE (WHICH HAS BEEN RENAMED THE GENERAL COURT) IN JULY 2009. THE HEARING OF OUR APPEAL TOOK PLACE IN JULY 2012. IN JUNE 2014, THE GENERAL COURT REJECTED OUR APPEAL IN ITS ENTIRETY. IN AUGUST 2014, WE FILED AN APPEAL WITH THE EUROPEAN COURT OF JUSTICE. IN NOVEMBER 2014, INTERVENER ASSOCIATION FOR COMPETITIVE TECHNOLOGIES FILED COMMENTS IN SUPPORT OF INTEL’S GROUNDS OF APPEAL. THE EC AND INTERVENERS FILED BRIEFS IN NOVEMBER 2014, WE FILED A REPLY IN FEBRUARY 2015, AND THE EC FILED A REJOINDER IN APRIL 2015. THE COURT OF JUSTICE HELD ORAL ARGUMENT IN JUNE 2016. IN OCTOBER 2016, ADVOCATE GENERAL WAHL, AN ADVISOR TO THE COURT OF JUSTICE, ISSUED A NON-BINDING ADVISORY OPINION WHICH FAVORED INTEL ON A NUMBER OF GROUNDS, WITH THE 25-JUDGE GRAND CHAMBER’S DECISION EXPECTED IN THE FIRST HALF OF 2017.

AT LEAST 82 SEPARATE CLASS-ACTION LAWSUITS WERE FILED IN THE U.S. DISTRICT COURTS FOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA, SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA, DISTRICT OF IDAHO, DISTRICT OF NEBRASKA, DISTRICT OF NEW MEXICO, DISTRICT OF MAINE, AND DISTRICT OF DELAWARE, AS WELL AS IN VARIOUS CALIFORNIA, KANSAS, AND TENNESSEE STATE COURTS. THESE ACTIONS GENERALLY REPEAT THE ALLEGATIONS MADE IN A NOW-SETTLED LAWSUIT FILED AGAINST US BY AMD IN JUNE 2005 IN THE U.S. DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE (AMD LITIGATION). LIKE THE AMD LITIGATION, THESE CLASS-ACTION LAWSUITS ALLEGE THAT WE ENGAGED IN VARIOUS ACTIONS IN VIOLATION OF THE SHERMAN ACT AND OTHER LAWS BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS: PROVIDING DISCOUNTS AND REBATES TO OUR MANUFACTURER AND DISTRIBUTOR CUSTOMERS CONDITIONED ON EXCLUSIVE OR NEAR-EXCLUSIVE DEALING THAT ALLEGEDLY UNFAIRLY INTERFERED WITH AMD'S ABILITY TO SELL ITS MICROPROCESSORS; INTERFERING WITH CERTAIN AMD PRODUCT LAUNCHES; AND INTERFERING WITH AMD'S PARTICIPATION IN CERTAIN INDUSTRY STANDARDS-SETTING GROUPS. THE CLASS ACTIONS ALLEGE VARIOUS CONSUMER INJURIES, INCLUDING THAT CONSUMERS IN VARIOUS STATES HAVE BEEN INJURED BY PAYING HIGHER PRICES FOR COMPUTERS CONTAINING OUR MICROPROCESSORS.

ALL OF THE FEDERAL AND STATE CLASS ACTIONS OTHER THAN THE CALIFORNIA CLASS ACTIONS WERE TRANSFERRED BY THE MULTIDISTRICT LITIGATION PANEL TO THE U.S. DISTRICT COURT IN DELAWARE FOR ALL PRE-TRIAL PROCEEDINGS AND DISCOVERY (MDL PROCEEDINGS). THE DELAWARE DISTRICT COURT APPOINTED A SPECIAL MASTER TO ADDRESS ISSUES IN THE MDL PROCEEDINGS, AS ASSIGNED BY THE COURT. IN JULY 2010, THE SPECIAL MASTER DENIED THE MDL PLAINTIFFS' MOTION TO CERTIFY A CLASS OF MEMBERS WHO PURCHASED CERTAIN PERSONAL COMPUTERS CONTAINING PRODUCTS SOLD BY US. IN JULY 2014, THE DISTRICT COURT AFFIRMED THE SPECIAL MASTER'S RULING AND ISSUED AN ORDER DENYING THE MDL PLAINTIFFS' MOTION FOR CLASS CERTIFICATION. IN AUGUST 2014, PLAINTIFFS FILED A PETITION FOR INTERLOCUTORY APPEAL OF THE DISTRICT COURT'S DECISION WITH THE U.S. COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE THIRD CIRCUIT, WHICH THE THIRD CIRCUIT DENIED IN OCTOBER 2014. IN DECEMBER 2014, WE FILED A MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT ON THE CLAIMS OF THE REMAINING INDIVIDUAL PLAINTIFFS. WE SUBSEQUENTLY NEGOTIATED A SETTLEMENT OF THE CLAIMS AND THE CASE WAS DISMISSED IN SEPTEMBER 2015.

ALL CALIFORNIA CLASS ACTIONS WERE CONSOLIDATED IN THE SUPERIOR COURT OF CALIFORNIA IN SANTA CLARA COUNTY. IN MARCH 2008, THE PLAINTIFFS IN THE CALIFORNIA ACTIONS MOVED FOR CLASS CERTIFICATION, WHICH WE OPPOSED. IN FEBRUARY 2015, THE COURT GRANTED PLAINTIFFS' REQUEST FOR LEAVE TO RETAIN A NEW EXPERT AND TO AMEND THEIR PREVIOUS MOTION FOR CLASS CERTIFICATION. IN MARCH 2016, THE COURT DENIED PLAINTIFFS’ AMENDED CLASS CERTIFICATION MOTION, AND PLAINTIFFS FILED A MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION. THE PARTIES SUBSEQUENTLY AGREED TO SETTLE THE CASE, AND THE LAWSUIT WAS DISMISSED IN JULY 2016.

IN OCTOBER 2015, THE COURT STAYED THE IBEW LAWSUIT FOR SIX MONTHS PENDING FURTHER DEVELOPMENTS IN THE CALIFORNIA CASE. IN MARCH 2016, INTEL AND IBEW ENTERED INTO A STIPULATED DISMISSAL PURSUANT TO WHICH IBEW DISMISSED ITS COMPLAINT BUT MAY RE-FILE UPON THE WITHDRAWAL OR FINAL RESOLUTION OF THE APPEAL IN THE PRSSL CALIFORNIA SHAREHOLDER DERIVATIVE LITIGATION.

IN APRIL 2016, JOHN ESPOSITO FILED A SHAREHOLDER DERIVATIVE ACTION IN THE SUPERIOR COURT OF CALIFORNIA IN SANTA CLARA COUNTY AGAINST INTEL, CURRENT MEMBERS OF OUR BOARD, AND CERTAIN FORMER OFFICERS AND EMPLOYEES. ESPOSITO MADE A DEMAND ON OUR BOARD IN 2013 TO INVESTIGATE WHETHER OUR OFFICERS OR DIRECTORS SHOULD BE SUED FOR THEIR PARTICIPATION IN THE EVENTS DESCRIBED IN IN RE HIGH TECH EMPLOYEE ANTITRUST LITIGATION. IN NOVEMBER 2015, OUR BOARD DECIDED NOT TO TAKE FURTHER ACTION ON ESPOSITO’S DEMAND BASED ON THE RECOMMENDATION OF THE AUDIT COMMITTEE OF THE BOARD AFTER ITS INVESTIGATION OF RELEVANT FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES. ESPOSITO SEEKS TO SET ASIDE SUCH DECISION, AND ALLEGES THAT THE BOARD WAS NOT DISINTERESTED IN MAKING THAT DECISION AND THAT THE INVESTIGATION WAS INADEQUATE. IN AUGUST 2016, INTEL FILED A MOTION TO DISMISS ESPOSITO’S COMPLAINT. IN NOVEMBER 2016, THE COURT GRANTED INTEL’S MOTION TO DISMISS THE CASE, WITHOUT LEAVE TO AMEND. ESPOSITO MAY APPEAL THIS DECISION.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

EVALUATION OF DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

BASED ON MANAGEMENT’S EVALUATION (WITH THE PARTICIPATION OF OUR CEO AND CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER (CFO)), AS OF THE END OF THE PERIOD COVERED BY THIS REPORT, OUR CEO AND CFO HAVE CONCLUDED THAT OUR DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES (AS DEFINED IN RULES 13A-15(E) AND 15D-15(E) UNDER THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934, AS AMENDED (THE EXCHANGE ACT)), ARE EFFECTIVE TO PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE THAT INFORMATION REQUIRED TO BE DISCLOSED BY US IN REPORTS THAT WE FILE OR SUBMIT UNDER THE EXCHANGE ACT IS RECORDED, PROCESSED, SUMMARIZED, AND REPORTED WITHIN THE TIME PERIODS SPECIFIED IN U.S. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (SEC) RULES AND FORMS, AND IS ACCUMULATED AND COMMUNICATED TO MANAGEMENT, INCLUDING OUR PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND PRINCIPAL FINANCIAL OFFICER, AS APPROPRIATE, TO ALLOW TIMELY DECISIONS REGARDING REQUIRED DISCLOSURE.

CHANGES IN INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

THERE WERE NO CHANGES TO OUR INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING (AS DEFINED IN RULES 13A-15(F) AND 15D-15(F) UNDER THE EXCHANGE ACT) THAT OCCURRED DURING THE QUARTER ENDED

DECEMBER 31, 2016

THAT HAVE MATERIALLY AFFECTED, OR ARE REASONABLY LIKELY TO MATERIALLY AFFECT, OUR INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING.

MANAGEMENT REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

OUR MANAGEMENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ESTABLISHING AND MAINTAINING ADEQUATE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING (AS DEFINED IN RULES 13A-15(F) AND 15D-15(F) UNDER THE EXCHANGE ACT) TO PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING THE RELIABILITY OF OUR FINANCIAL REPORTING AND THE PREPARATION OF CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR EXTERNAL PURPOSES IN ACCORDANCE WITH U.S. GAAP.

MANAGEMENT ASSESSED OUR INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2016

, THE END OF OUR FISCAL YEAR. MANAGEMENT BASED ITS ASSESSMENT ON CRITERIA ESTABLISHED IN INTERNAL CONTROL—INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK ISSUED BY THE COMMITTEE OF SPONSORING ORGANIZATIONS OF THE TREADWAY COMMISSION (

2013 FRAMEWORK

). MANAGEMENT’S ASSESSMENT INCLUDED EVALUATION OF ELEMENTS SUCH AS THE DESIGN AND OPERATING EFFECTIVENESS OF KEY FINANCIAL REPORTING CONTROLS, PROCESS DOCUMENTATION, ACCOUNTING POLICIES, AND OUR OVERALL CONTROL ENVIRONMENT.

BASED ON THIS ASSESSMENT, MANAGEMENT HAS CONCLUDED THAT OUR INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING WAS EFFECTIVE AS OF THE END OF THE FISCAL YEAR TO PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING THE RELIABILITY OF FINANCIAL REPORTING AND THE PREPARATION OF CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR EXTERNAL REPORTING PURPOSES IN ACCORDANCE WITH U.S. GAAP. WE REVIEWED THE RESULTS OF MANAGEMENT’S ASSESSMENT WITH THE AUDIT COMMITTEE OF OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS.

OUR INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM, ERNST & YOUNG LLP, INDEPENDENTLY ASSESSED THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE COMPANY’S INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, AS STATED IN THE FIRM’S ATTESTATION REPORT, WHICH IS INCLUDED WITHIN PART II, ITEM 8 OF THIS FORM 10-K.

INHERENT LIMITATIONS ON EFFECTIVENESS OF CONTROLS

OUR MANAGEMENT, INCLUDING THE CEO AND CFO, DOES NOT EXPECT THAT OUR DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES OR OUR INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING WILL PREVENT OR DETECT ALL ERRORS AND ALL FRAUD. A CONTROL SYSTEM, NO MATTER HOW WELL-DESIGNED AND OPERATED, CAN PROVIDE ONLY REASONABLE, NOT ABSOLUTE, ASSURANCE THAT THE CONTROL SYSTEM’S OBJECTIVES WILL BE MET. THE DESIGN OF A CONTROL SYSTEM MUST REFLECT THE FACT THAT THERE ARE RESOURCE CONSTRAINTS, AND THE BENEFITS OF CONTROLS MUST BE CONSIDERED RELATIVE TO THEIR COSTS. FURTHER, BECAUSE OF THE INHERENT LIMITATIONS IN ALL CONTROL SYSTEMS, NO EVALUATION OF CONTROLS CAN PROVIDE ABSOLUTE ASSURANCE THAT MISSTATEMENTS DUE TO ERROR OR FRAUD WILL NOT OCCUR OR THAT ALL CONTROL ISSUES AND INSTANCES OF FRAUD, IF ANY, HAVE BEEN DETECTED. THE DESIGN OF ANY SYSTEM OF CONTROLS IS BASED IN PART ON CERTAIN ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT THE LIKELIHOOD OF FUTURE EVENTS, AND THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT ANY DESIGN WILL SUCCEED IN ACHIEVING ITS STATED GOALS UNDER ALL POTENTIAL FUTURE CONDITIONS.
