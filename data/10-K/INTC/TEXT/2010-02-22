TABLE OF CONTENTS

PRODUCTS

WE DESIGN AND MANUFACTURE

COMPUTING AND COMMUNICATIONS COMPONENTS, SUCH AS

MICROPROCESSORS, CHIPSETS, MOTHERBOARDS, AND WIRELESS AND WIRED

CONNECTIVITY PRODUCTS, AS WELL AS PLATFORMS THAT INCORPORATE

THESE COMPONENTS. WE STRIVE TO OPTIMIZE THE OVERALL PERFORMANCE

IMPROVEMENTS OF OUR PRODUCTS BY BALANCING INCREASED PERFORMANCE

CAPABILITIES WITH IMPROVED ENERGY EFFICIENCY. INCREASED

PERFORMANCE CAN INCLUDE FASTER PROCESSING PERFORMANCE AND OTHER

IMPROVED CAPABILITIES, SUCH AS MULTITHREADING AND MULTITASKING.

PERFORMANCE CAN ALSO BE IMPROVED THROUGH ENHANCED CONNECTIVITY,

STORAGE, SECURITY, MANAGEABILITY, UTILIZATION, RELIABILITY, EASE

OF USE, AND INTEROPERABILITY AMONG DEVICES. IMPROVED ENERGY

EFFICIENCY IS ACHIEVED BY LOWERING POWER CONSUMPTION IN RELATION

TO PERFORMANCE CAPABILITIES, WHICH MAY EXTEND UTILIZATION TIME

FOR BATTERY-POWERED FORM FACTORS AND REDUCE SYSTEM HEAT OUTPUT,

THEREBY PROVIDING POWER SAVINGS AND REDUCING THE TOTAL COST OF

OWNERSHIP.

WE OFFER PRODUCTS AT VARIOUS

LEVELS OF INTEGRATION, TO ALLOW OUR CUSTOMERS FLEXIBILITY IN

CREATING COMPUTING AND COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEMS. THE SUBSTANTIAL

MAJORITY OF OUR REVENUE IS FROM THE SALE OF MICROPROCESSORS AND

CHIPSETS.

COMPONENTS

MICROPROCESSORS

A MICROPROCESSORTHE CENTRAL

PROCESSING UNIT (CPU) OF A COMPUTER SYSTEMPROCESSES SYSTEM

DATA AND CONTROLS OTHER DEVICES IN THE SYSTEM, ACTING AS THE

BRAINS OF THE COMPUTER. WE OFFER MICROPROCESSORS

WITH ONE OR MULTIPLE PROCESSOR CORES DESIGNED FOR NOTEBOOKS,

NETBOOKS, DESKTOPS, SERVERS, WORKSTATIONS, STORAGE PRODUCTS,

EMBEDDED APPLICATIONS, COMMUNICATIONS PRODUCTS, CONSUMER

ELECTRONICS DEVICES, AND HANDHELDS. THE FOLLOWING ARE

CHARACTERISTICS OF OUR MICROPROCESSORS.



MULTI-CORE MICROPROCESSORS CONTAIN

TWO OR MORE PROCESSOR CORES, WHICH CAN ENABLE IMPROVED

MULTITASKING AND ENERGY-EFFICIENT PERFORMANCE BY DISTRIBUTING

COMPUTING TASKS ACROSS MULTIPLE CORES.



CACHE IS MEMORY THAT CAN BE

LOCATED DIRECTLY ON THE MICROPROCESSOR. INCORPORATING ADDITIONAL

AMOUNTS

AND/OR

LEVELS OF CACHE CAN ENABLE HIGHER PERFORMANCE BY PERMITTING

QUICKER ACCESS TO FREQUENTLY USED DATA AND INSTRUCTIONS.



SOME OF OUR MICROPROCESSORS ALSO

INCLUDE AN INTEGRATED MEMORY CONTROLLER OR AN INTEGRATED MEMORY

CONTROLLER AND INTEGRATED GRAPHICS FUNCTIONALITY. BOTH AN

INTEGRATED MEMORY CONTROLLER AND INTEGRATED GRAPHICS

FUNCTIONALITY CAN INCREASE THE SPEED AT WHICH DATA IS

TRANSFERRED BETWEEN SYSTEM COMPONENTS.

MOST OF OUR MICROPROCESSORS ARE

BASED ON THE LATEST GENERATION

INTEL

®

CORE

TM

MICROARCHITECTURE AND ARE MANUFACTURED USING OUR

45-NANOMETER

(NM) HI-K METAL GATE SILICON PROCESS TECHNOLOGY (45NM PROCESS

TECHNOLOGY) OR OUR 32NM SECOND-GENERATION HI-K METAL GATE

SILICON PROCESS TECHNOLOGY (32NM PROCESS TECHNOLOGY). THESE

TECHNOLOGIES ARE THE FIRST TO USE HI-K METAL GATE TRANSISTORS,

WHICH INCREASE PERFORMANCE WHILE SIMULTANEOUSLY REDUCING THE

LEAKAGE OF CURRENTS. MICROARCHITECTURE REFERS TO THE LAYOUT,

DENSITY, AND LOGICAL DESIGN OF A MICROPROCESSOR. THE LATEST

GENERATION INTEL CORE MICROARCHITECTURE INCORPORATES FEATURES

DESIGNED TO INCREASE PERFORMANCE AND ENERGY EFFICIENCY, SUCH AS.



INTEL

®

TURBO BOOST TECHNOLOGY

, WHICH INCREASES PROCESSOR

FREQUENCY WHEN APPLICATIONS DEMAND MORE PERFORMANCE; AND



INTEL

®

HYPER-THREADING TECHNOLOGY

, WHICH ALLOWS EACH PROCESSOR

CORE TO PROCESS TWO SOFTWARE TASKS OR THREADS SIMULTANEOUSLY.

WE ALSO OFFER, AND ARE CONTINUING

TO DEVELOP, SYSTEM ON CHIP (SOC) PRODUCTS THAT INTEGRATE OUR

CORE PROCESSING FUNCTIONALITIES WITH OTHER SYSTEM COMPONENTS,

SUCH AS GRAPHICS, AUDIO, AND VIDEO, ONTO A SINGLE CHIP TO FORM A

PURPOSE-BUILT SOLUTION. SOC PRODUCTS ARE DESIGNED TO PROVIDE

IMPROVED PERFORMANCE DUE TO HIGHER INTEGRATION, LOWER POWER

CONSUMPTION, AND SMALLER FORM FACTORS.

CHIPSETS

THE CHIPSET OPERATES AS THE

NERVOUS SYSTEM IN A PC OR OTHER COMPUTING DEVICE,

SENDING DATA BETWEEN THE MICROPROCESSOR AND INPUT, DISPLAY, AND

STORAGE DEVICES, SUCH AS THE KEYBOARD, MOUSE, MONITOR, HARD

DRIVE OR SOLID-STATE DRIVE, AND CD, DVD, OR BLU-RAY* DRIVE. WE

OFFER CHIPSETS DESIGNED FOR NOTEBOOKS, NETBOOKS, DESKTOPS,

SERVERS, WORKSTATIONS, STORAGE PRODUCTS, EMBEDDED APPLICATIONS,

COMMUNICATIONS PRODUCTS, CONSUMER ELECTRONICS DEVICES, AND

HANDHELDS. CHIPSETS EXTEND THE AUDIO, VIDEO, AND OTHER

CAPABILITIES OF MANY SYSTEMS AND PERFORM ESSENTIAL LOGIC

FUNCTIONS, SUCH AS BALANCING THE PERFORMANCE OF THE SYSTEM AND

REMOVING BOTTLENECKS. SOME CHIPSETS MAY ALSO INCLUDE GRAPHICS

FUNCTIONALITY OR GRAPHICS FUNCTIONALITY AND A MEMORY CONTROLLER,

FOR USE WITH OUR MICROPROCESSORS THAT DO NOT INTEGRATE THOSE

SYSTEM COMPONENTS.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

MOTHERBOARDS

WE OFFER MOTHERBOARD PRODUCTS

DESIGNED FOR OUR DESKTOP, SERVER, AND WORKSTATION PLATFORMS. A

MOTHERBOARD IS THE PRINCIPAL BOARD WITHIN A SYSTEM, AND

TYPICALLY CONTAINS THE MICROPROCESSOR, CHIPSET, MEMORY, AND

OTHER COMPONENTS. THE MOTHERBOARD ALSO HAS CONNECTORS FOR

ATTACHING DEVICES TO THE BUS, WHICH IS THE SUBSYSTEM THAT

TRANSFERS DATA BETWEEN VARIOUS COMPONENTS OF A COMPUTER.

WIRELESS

AND WIRED CONNECTIVITY

WE OFFER WIRELESS AND WIRED

CONNECTIVITY PRODUCTS, INCLUDING NETWORK ADAPTERS AND EMBEDDED

WIRELESS CARDS, BASED ON INDUSTRY-STANDARD PROTOCOLS USED TO

TRANSLATE AND TRANSMIT DATA ACROSS NETWORKS. WIRELESS

CONNECTIVITY PRODUCTS BASED ON WIFI TECHNOLOGY ALLOW USERS TO

WIRELESSLY CONNECT TO HIGH-SPEED LOCAL AREA NETWORKS, TYPICALLY

WITHIN A CLOSE RANGE. WE HAVE ALSO DEVELOPED WIRELESS

CONNECTIVITY PRODUCTS FOR BOTH MOBILE AND FIXED NETWORKS BASED

ON WIMAX, A STANDARDS-BASED WIRELESS TECHNOLOGY PROVIDING

HIGH-SPEED BROADBAND CONNECTIVITY THAT CAN LINK USERS AND

NETWORKS UP TO SEVERAL MILES APART.

PLATFORMS

A PLATFORM TYPICALLY INCLUDES A

MICROPROCESSOR, CHIPSET, AND ENABLING SOFTWARE, AND MAY INCLUDE

ADDITIONAL HARDWARE, SERVICES, AND SUPPORT. IN DEVELOPING OUR

PLATFORMS, WE MAY INCLUDE COMPONENTS MADE BY OTHER COMPANIES.

PLATFORMS BASED ON OUR LATEST GENERATION INTEL CORE

MICROARCHITECTURE USING OUR 32NM PROCESS TECHNOLOGY INTEGRATE A

MEMORY CONTROLLER AND GRAPHICS FUNCTIONALITY INTO EACH

MICROPROCESSOR, AND CONNECT THE MICROPROCESSOR AND OTHER

COMPONENTS WITH A HIGH-SPEED INTERCONNECT. WE REFER TO CERTAIN

PLATFORM BRANDS WITHIN OUR PRODUCT OFFERINGS AS PROCESSOR

TECHNOLOGIES.

MICROPROCESSOR

AND PLATFORM TECHNOLOGIES

WE OFFER FEATURES TO IMPROVE

MICROPROCESSOR AND PLATFORM CAPABILITIES THAT CAN ENHANCE SYSTEM

PERFORMANCE AND USER EXPERIENCE. FOR EXAMPLE, WE OFFER

TECHNOLOGIES THAT CAN HELP INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY MANAGERS

MAINTAIN, MANAGE, AND PROTECT ENABLED SYSTEMS THAT ARE PLUGGED

INTO A POWER SOURCE AND CONNECTED TO A NETWORK, EVEN IF A

COMPUTER IS TURNED OFF OR HAS A FAILED HARD DRIVE OR OPERATING

SYSTEM. ADDITIONAL FEATURES CAN ENABLE VIRTUALIZATION, IN WHICH

A SINGLE COMPUTER SYSTEM CAN FUNCTION AS MULTIPLE VIRTUAL

SYSTEMS BY RUNNING MULTIPLE OPERATING SYSTEMS AND APPLICATIONS.

VIRTUALIZATION CAN CONSOLIDATE WORKLOADS AND PROVIDE INCREASED

SECURITY AND MANAGEMENT CAPABILITIES. TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THESE

AND OTHER FEATURES THAT WE OFFER, A COMPUTER SYSTEM MUST HAVE A

MICROPROCESSOR THAT SUPPORTS A CHIPSET AND BIOS (BASIC

INPUT/OUTPUT SYSTEM) THAT USE THE TECHNOLOGY, AND SOFTWARE THAT

IS OPTIMIZED FOR THE TECHNOLOGY. PERFORMANCE WILL VARY DEPENDING

ON THE SYSTEM HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE USED.

OUR 65NM PROCESS TECHNOLOGY IN LATE 2010 OR EARLY 2011.

AS OF DECEMBER 26, 2009, THE

SUBSTANTIAL MAJORITY OF OUR MICROPROCESSORS WERE MANUFACTURED ON

300MM WAFERS USING OUR 45NM PROCESS TECHNOLOGY. IN THE SECOND

HALF OF 2009, WE BEGAN MANUFACTURING MICROPROCESSORS USING OUR

32NM PROCESS TECHNOLOGY. AS WE MOVE TO EACH SUCCEEDING

GENERATION OF MANUFACTURING PROCESS TECHNOLOGY, WE INCUR

SIGNIFICANT

START-UP

COSTS TO PREPARE EACH FACTORY FOR MANUFACTURING. HOWEVER,

CONTINUING TO ADVANCE OUR PROCESS TECHNOLOGY PROVIDES BENEFITS

THAT WE BELIEVE JUSTIFY THESE COSTS. THE BENEFITS OF MOVING TO

EACH SUCCEEDING GENERATION OF MANUFACTURING PROCESS TECHNOLOGY

CAN INCLUDE USING LESS SPACE PER TRANSISTOR, REDUCING HEAT

OUTPUT FROM EACH TRANSISTOR,

AND/OR

INCREASING THE NUMBER OF INTEGRATED FEATURES ON EACH CHIP. THESE

ADVANCEMENTS CAN RESULT IN MICROPROCESSORS THAT ARE HIGHER

PERFORMING, CONSUME LESS POWER,

AND/OR

COST

LESS TO MANUFACTURE.

WE USE THIRD-PARTY MANUFACTURING

COMPANIES (FOUNDRIES) TO MANUFACTURE WAFERS FOR CERTAIN

COMPONENTS, INCLUDING NETWORKING AND COMMUNICATIONS PRODUCTS. IN

ADDITION, WE PRIMARILY USE SUBCONTRACTORS TO MANUFACTURE

BOARD-LEVEL PRODUCTS AND SYSTEMS, AND PURCHASE CERTAIN

COMMUNICATIONS NETWORKING PRODUCTS FROM EXTERNAL VENDORS IN THE

ASIA-PACIFIC REGION.

OUR NAND FLASH MEMORY PRODUCTS ARE

MANUFACTURED BY IMFT, A NAND FLASH MEMORY MANUFACTURING COMPANY

THAT WE FORMED WITH MICRON TECHNOLOGY, INC. OUR NAND FLASH

MEMORY PRODUCTS ARE MANUFACTURED BY IMFT USING 34NM OR 50NM

PROCESS TECHNOLOGY, AND WE EXPECT TO OFFER NAND FLASH MEMORY

PRODUCTS USING 25NM PROCESS TECHNOLOGY DURING THE SECOND QUARTER

BEGIN PRODUCTION IN THE SECOND HALF OF 2010. TO AUGMENT

CAPACITY, WE USE SUBCONTRACTORS TO PERFORM ASSEMBLY OF CERTAIN

PRODUCTS, PRIMARILY CHIPSETS AND NETWORKING AND COMMUNICATIONS

PRODUCTS.

OUR EMPLOYMENT PRACTICES ARE

CONSISTENT WITH, AND WE EXPECT OUR SUPPLIERS AND SUBCONTRACTORS

TO ABIDE BY, LOCAL COUNTRY LAW. IN ADDITION, WE IMPOSE A MINIMUM

EMPLOYEE AGE REQUIREMENT AS WELL AS PROGRESSIVE EHS

REQUIREMENTS, REGARDLESS OF LOCAL LAW.

WE HAVE THOUSANDS OF SUPPLIERS,

INCLUDING SUBCONTRACTORS, PROVIDING OUR VARIOUS MATERIALS AND

SERVICE NEEDS. WE SET EXPECTATIONS FOR SUPPLIER PERFORMANCE AND

REINFORCE THOSE EXPECTATIONS WITH PERIODIC ASSESSMENTS. WE

COMMUNICATE THOSE EXPECTATIONS TO OUR SUPPLIERS REGULARLY AND

WORK WITH THEM TO IMPLEMENT IMPROVEMENTS WHEN NECESSARY. WE

SEEK, WHERE POSSIBLE, TO HAVE SEVERAL SOURCES OF SUPPLY FOR ALL

OF THESE MATERIALS AND RESOURCES, BUT WE MAY RELY ON A SINGLE OR

LIMITED NUMBER OF SUPPLIERS, OR UPON SUPPLIERS IN A SINGLE

COUNTRY. IN THOSE CASES, WE DEVELOP AND IMPLEMENT PLANS AND

ACTIONS TO REDUCE THE EXPOSURE THAT WOULD RESULT FROM A

DISRUPTION IN SUPPLY. WE HAVE ENTERED INTO LONG-TERM CONTRACTS

WITH CERTAIN SUPPLIERS TO ENSURE A PORTION OF OUR SILICON SUPPLY.

OUR PRODUCTS ARE TYPICALLY

PRODUCED AT MULTIPLE INTEL FACILITIES AT VARIOUS SITES AROUND

THE WORLD, OR BY SUBCONTRACTORS WHO HAVE MULTIPLE FACILITIES.

HOWEVER, SOME PRODUCTS ARE PRODUCED IN ONLY ONE INTEL OR

SUBCONTRACTOR FACILITY, AND WE SEEK TO IMPLEMENT ACTIONS AND

PLANS TO REDUCE THE EXPOSURE THAT WOULD RESULT FROM A DISRUPTION

AT ANY SUCH FACILITY. SEE RISK FACTORS IN PART I,

RESEARCH

AND DEVELOPMENT

WE ARE COMMITTED TO INVESTING IN

WORLD-CLASS TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT, PARTICULARLY IN THE DESIGN

AND MANUFACTURE OF INTEGRATED CIRCUITS. RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

(R&D) EXPENDITURES IN 2009 WERE $5.7 BILLION ($5.7 BILLION

IN 2008 AND $5.8 BILLION IN 2007).

OUR R&D ACTIVITIES ARE

DIRECTED TOWARD DEVELOPING THE TECHNOLOGY INNOVATIONS THAT WE

BELIEVE WILL DELIVER OUR NEXT GENERATION OF PRODUCTS AND

PLATFORMS, WHICH WILL IN TURN ENABLE NEW FORM FACTORS AND NEW

USAGE MODELS FOR BUSINESSES AND CONSUMERS. OUR R&D

ACTIVITIES RANGE FROM DESIGNING AND DEVELOPING PRODUCTS, TO

DEVELOPING AND REFINING MANUFACTURING PROCESSES, TO RESEARCHING

FUTURE TECHNOLOGIES AND PRODUCTS.

WE ARE FOCUSING OUR R&D

EFFORTS ON ADVANCED COMPUTING TECHNOLOGIES, DEVELOPING NEW

MICROARCHITECTURES, ADVANCING OUR SILICON MANUFACTURING PROCESS

TECHNOLOGY, DELIVERING THE NEXT GENERATION OF MICROPROCESSORS

AND CHIPSETS, IMPROVING OUR PLATFORM INITIATIVES, AND DEVELOPING

SOFTWARE SOLUTIONS AND TOOLS TO SUPPORT OUR TECHNOLOGIES. OUR

R&D EFFORTS ENABLE NEW LEVELS OF PERFORMANCE AND ADDRESS

AREAS SUCH AS ENERGY EFFICIENCY, SCALABILITY FOR MULTI-CORE

ARCHITECTURES, SYSTEM MANAGEABILITY AND SECURITY, AND EASE OF

USE. WE CONTINUE TO MAKE SIGNIFICANT R&D INVESTMENTS IN THE

DEVELOPMENT OF SOCS TO ENABLE GROWTH IN AREAS SUCH AS HANDHELDS

(INCLUDING MIDS AND SMARTPHONES), EMBEDDED APPLICATIONS, AND

CONSUMER ELECTRONICS. IN ADDITION, WE CONTINUE TO MAKE

SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS IN GRAPHICS AND WIRELESS TECHNOLOGIES.

AS PART OF OUR R&D EFFORTS,

WE PLAN TO INTRODUCE A NEW MICROARCHITECTURE FOR OUR NOTEBOOK,

DESKTOP, AND INTEL XEON PROCESSORS APPROXIMATELY EVERY TWO YEARS

AND RAMP THE NEXT GENERATION OF SILICON PROCESS TECHNOLOGY IN

THE INTERVENING YEARS. WE REFER TO THIS AS OUR

TICK-TOCK TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT CADENCE. IN 2009,

WE STARTED MANUFACTURING MICROPROCESSORS USING OUR NEW 32NM

SECOND-GENERATION HI-K METAL GATE SILICON PROCESS TECHNOLOGY,

AND WE EXPECT TO INTRODUCE A NEW MICROARCHITECTURE USING OUR

32NM PROCESS TECHNOLOGY IN 2010. WE ARE CURRENTLY DEVELOPING

22NM PROCESS TECHNOLOGY, OUR NEXT-GENERATION PROCESS TECHNOLOGY,

AND EXPECT TO BEGIN MANUFACTURING PRODUCTS USING THAT TECHNOLOGY

IN 2011. OUR LEADERSHIP IN SILICON TECHNOLOGY HAS ENABLED US TO

MAKE MOORES LAW A REALITY. MOORES LAW

PREDICTED THAT TRANSISTOR DENSITY ON INTEGRATED CIRCUITS WOULD

DOUBLE ABOUT EVERY TWO YEARS. OUR LEADERSHIP IN SILICON

TECHNOLOGY HAS ALSO HELPED EXPAND ON THE ADVANCES ANTICIPATED BY

MOORES LAW BY BRINGING NEW CAPABILITIES INTO SILICON AND

PRODUCING NEW PRODUCTS AND PLATFORMS OPTIMIZED FOR A WIDER

VARIETY OF APPLICATIONS.

OUR R&D MODEL IS BASED ON A

GLOBAL ORGANIZATION THAT EMPHASIZES A COLLABORATIVE APPROACH TO

IDENTIFYING AND DEVELOPING NEW TECHNOLOGIES, LEADING STANDARDS

INITIATIVES, AND INFLUENCING REGULATORY POLICIES TO ACCELERATE

THE ADOPTION OF NEW TECHNOLOGIES. OUR R&D INITIATIVES ARE

PERFORMED BY VARIOUS BUSINESS GROUPS WITHIN THE COMPANY, AND WE

CENTRALLY MANAGE KEY CROSS-BUSINESS GROUP PRODUCT INITIATIVES TO

ALIGN AND PRIORITIZE OUR R&D ACTIVITIES ACROSS THESE

GROUPS. IN ADDITION, WE MAY AUGMENT OUR R&D INITIATIVES BY

INVESTING IN COMPANIES OR ENTERING INTO AGREEMENTS WITH

COMPANIES THAT HAVE SIMILAR R&D FOCUS AREAS. FOR EXAMPLE,

WE HAVE AN AGREEMENT WITH MICRON FOR JOINT DEVELOPMENT OF NAND

FLASH MEMORY TECHNOLOGIES.

SALES

ARRANGEMENTS

OUR PRODUCTS ARE SOLD OR LICENSED

THROUGH SALES OFFICES THROUGHOUT THE WORLD. SALES OF OUR

PRODUCTS ARE TYPICALLY MADE VIA PURCHASE ORDERS THAT CONTAIN

STANDARD TERMS AND CONDITIONS COVERING MATTERS SUCH AS PRICING,

PAYMENT TERMS, AND WARRANTIES, AS WELL AS INDEMNITIES FOR ISSUES

SPECIFIC TO OUR PRODUCTS, SUCH AS PATENT AND COPYRIGHT

INDEMNITIES. FROM TIME TO TIME, WE MAY ENTER INTO ADDITIONAL

AGREEMENTS WITH CUSTOMERS COVERING, FOR EXAMPLE, CHANGES FROM

OUR STANDARD TERMS AND CONDITIONS, NEW PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT AND

MARKETING, PRIVATE-LABEL BRANDING, AND OTHER MATTERS. MOST OF

OUR SALES ARE MADE USING ELECTRONIC AND WEB-BASED PROCESSES THAT

ALLOW THE CUSTOMER TO REVIEW INVENTORY AVAILABILITY AND TRACK

THE PROGRESS OF SPECIFIC GOODS ORDERED. PRICING ON PARTICULAR

PRODUCTS MAY VARY BASED ON VOLUMES ORDERED AND OTHER FACTORS. WE

ALSO OFFER DISCOUNTS, REBATES, AND OTHER INCENTIVES TO CUSTOMERS

TO INCREASE ACCEPTANCE OF OUR PRODUCTS AND TECHNOLOGY.

OUR PRODUCTS ARE TYPICALLY SHIPPED

UNDER TERMS THAT TRANSFER TITLE TO THE CUSTOMER, EVEN IN

ARRANGEMENTS FOR WHICH THE RECOGNITION OF REVENUE AND RELATED

COSTS OF SALES IS DEFERRED. OUR STANDARD TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF

SALE TYPICALLY PROVIDE THAT PAYMENT IS DUE AT A LATER DATE,

GENERALLY 30 DAYS AFTER SHIPMENT OR DELIVERY. OUR CREDIT

DEPARTMENT SETS ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND SHIPPING LIMITS FOR

INDIVIDUAL CUSTOMERS TO CONTROL CREDIT RISK TO INTEL ARISING

FROM OUTSTANDING ACCOUNT BALANCES. WE ASSESS CREDIT RISK THROUGH

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE ANALYSIS, AND FROM THIS ANALYSIS,

WE ESTABLISH CREDIT LIMITS AND DETERMINE WHETHER WE WILL SEEK TO

USE ONE OR MORE CREDIT SUPPORT DEVICES, SUCH AS OBTAINING SOME

FORM OF THIRD-PARTY GUARANTY OR STANDBY LETTER OF CREDIT, OR

OBTAINING CREDIT INSURANCE FOR ALL OR A PORTION OF THE ACCOUNT

BALANCE IF NECESSARY. CREDIT LOSSES MAY STILL BE INCURRED DUE TO

BANKRUPTCY, FRAUD, OR OTHER FAILURE OF THE CUSTOMER TO PAY. FOR

INFORMATION ABOUT OUR ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL RECEIVABLES, SEE

SCHEDULE IIVALUATION AND QUALIFYING ACCOUNTS

IN PART IV OF THIS FORM

MOST OF OUR SALES TO DISTRIBUTORS

ARE MADE UNDER AGREEMENTS ALLOWING FOR PRICE PROTECTION ON

UNSOLD MERCHANDISE AND A RIGHT OF RETURN ON STIPULATED

QUANTITIES OF UNSOLD MERCHANDISE. UNDER THE PRICE PROTECTION

PROGRAM, WE GIVE DISTRIBUTORS CREDITS FOR THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN

THE ORIGINAL PRICE PAID AND THE CURRENT PRICE THAT WE OFFER. ON

MOST PRODUCTS, THERE IS NO CONTRACTUAL LIMIT ON THE AMOUNT OF

PRICE PROTECTION, NOR IS THERE A LIMIT ON THE TIME HORIZON UNDER

WHICH PRICE PROTECTION IS GRANTED. THE RIGHT OF RETURN GRANTED

GENERALLY CONSISTS OF A STOCK ROTATION PROGRAM IN WHICH

DISTRIBUTORS ARE ABLE TO EXCHANGE CERTAIN PRODUCTS BASED ON THE

NUMBER OF QUALIFIED PURCHASES MADE BY THE DISTRIBUTOR. ALTHOUGH

WE HAVE THE OPTION TO GRANT CREDIT FOR, REPAIR, OR REPLACE

DEFECTIVE PRODUCTS, THERE IS NO CONTRACTUAL LIMIT ON THE AMOUNT

OF CREDIT GRANTED TO A DISTRIBUTOR.

DISTRIBUTION

TYPICALLY, DISTRIBUTORS HANDLE A

WIDE VARIETY OF PRODUCTS, INCLUDING THOSE THAT COMPETE WITH OUR

PRODUCTS, AND FILL ORDERS FOR MANY CUSTOMERS. WE ALSO UTILIZE

THIRD-PARTY SALES REPRESENTATIVES WHO GENERALLY DO NOT OFFER

DIRECTLY COMPETITIVE PRODUCTS BUT MAY CARRY COMPLEMENTARY ITEMS

MANUFACTURED BY OTHERS. SALES REPRESENTATIVES DO NOT MAINTAIN A

PRODUCT INVENTORY; INSTEAD, THEIR CUSTOMERS PLACE ORDERS

DIRECTLY WITH US OR THROUGH DISTRIBUTORS. SEVERAL DISTRIBUTION

WAREHOUSES ARE LOCATED IN CLOSE PROXIMITY TO KEY CUSTOMERS.

BACKLOG

WE DO NOT BELIEVE THAT BACKLOG AS

OF ANY PARTICULAR DATE IS MEANINGFUL, AS OUR SALES ARE MADE

PRIMARILY PURSUANT TO STANDARD PURCHASE ORDERS FOR DELIVERY OF

PRODUCTS. ONLY A SMALL PORTION OF OUR ORDERS IS NON-CANCELABLE,

AND THE DOLLAR AMOUNT ASSOCIATED WITH THE NON-CANCELABLE PORTION

IS NOT SIGNIFICANT.

SEASONAL

TRENDS

OUR MICROPROCESSOR SALES GENERALLY

HAVE FOLLOWED A SEASONAL TREND. HISTORICALLY, OUR SALES HAVE

BEEN HIGHER IN THE SECOND HALF OF THE YEAR THAN IN THE FIRST

HALF OF THE YEAR. CONSUMER PURCHASES OF PCS HAVE HISTORICALLY

BEEN HIGHER IN THE SECOND HALF OF THE YEAR, PRIMARILY DUE TO

BACK-TO-SCHOOL

AND HOLIDAY DEMAND. IN ADDITION, PURCHASES FROM BUSINESSES HAVE

ALSO HISTORICALLY TENDED TO BE HIGHER IN THE SECOND HALF OF THE

YEAR.

MARKETING

OUR CORPORATE MARKETING OBJECTIVES

ARE TO BUILD A STRONG INTEL CORPORATE BRAND THAT CONNECTS WITH

CONSUMERS, AND HAVE A LIMITED NUMBER OF MEANINGFUL AND VALUABLE

BRANDS IN OUR PORTFOLIO TO AID BUSINESSES AND CONSUMERS IN

MAKING INFORMED CHOICES AND TO MAKE TECHNOLOGY PURCHASE

DECISIONS EASIER FOR THEM. THE INTEL CORE PROCESSOR FAMILY AND

THE INTEL ATOM, INTEL PENTIUM, INTEL CELERON, INTEL XEON, AND

INTEL ITANIUM TRADEMARKS MAKE UP OUR PROCESSOR BRANDS.

WE PROMOTE BRAND AWARENESS AND

GENERATE DEMAND THROUGH OUR OWN DIRECT MARKETING AS WELL AS

CO-MARKETING PROGRAMS. OUR DIRECT MARKETING ACTIVITIES INCLUDE

TELEVISION, PRINT, AND WEB-BASED ADVERTISING, AS WELL AS PRESS

RELATIONS, CONSUMER AND TRADE EVENTS, AND INDUSTRY AND CONSUMER

COMMUNICATIONS. WE MARKET TO CONSUMER AND BUSINESS AUDIENCES,

AND FOCUS ON BUILDING AWARENESS AND GENERATING DEMAND FOR

INCREASED PERFORMANCE, POWER EFFICIENCY, AND NEW CAPABILITIES.

PURCHASES BY CUSTOMERS OFTEN ALLOW

THEM TO PARTICIPATE IN COOPERATIVE ADVERTISING AND MARKETING

PROGRAMS SUCH AS THE INTEL

INSIDE

PROGRAM. THIS PROGRAM BROADENS THE REACH OF OUR BRANDS BEYOND

THE SCOPE OF OUR OWN DIRECT ADVERTISING. THROUGH THE INTEL

INSIDE PROGRAM, CERTAIN CUSTOMERS ARE LICENSED TO PLACE INTEL

LOGOS ON COMPUTERS CONTAINING OUR MICROPROCESSORS AND PROCESSOR

TECHNOLOGIES, AND TO USE OUR BRANDS IN MARKETING ACTIVITIES. THE

PROGRAM INCLUDES A MARKET DEVELOPMENT COMPONENT THAT ACCRUES

FUNDS BASED ON PURCHASES AND PARTIALLY REIMBURSES THE OEMS FOR

MARKETING ACTIVITIES FOR PRODUCTS FEATURING INTEL BRANDS,

SUBJECT TO THE OEMS MEETING DEFINED CRITERIA. THESE MARKETING

ACTIVITIES PRIMARILY INCLUDE TELEVISION, PRINT, AND AN INCREASED

FOCUS ON WEB-BASED MARKETING. WE HAVE ALSO ENTERED INTO JOINT

MARKETING ARRANGEMENTS WITH CERTAIN CUSTOMERS.

COMPETITION

THE SEMICONDUCTOR INDUSTRY IS

DYNAMIC, CHARACTERIZED BY RAPID ADVANCES IN TECHNOLOGY AND

FREQUENT PRODUCT INTRODUCTIONS. AS UNIT VOLUMES OF A PRODUCT

GROW, PRODUCTION EXPERIENCE IS ACCUMULATED AND COSTS TYPICALLY

DECREASE, FURTHER COMPETITION DEVELOPS, AND PRICES DECLINE. THE

LIFE CYCLE OF OUR PRODUCTS IS VERY SHORT, SOMETIMES LESS THAN A

YEAR. THESE SHORT PRODUCT LIFE CYCLES AND OTHER FACTORS LEAD TO

FREQUENT NEGOTIATIONS WITH OUR OEM CUSTOMERS, WHICH TYPICALLY

ARE LARGE, SOPHISTICATED BUYERS WHO ARE ALSO OPERATING IN VERY

COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENTS. OUR ABILITY TO COMPETE DEPENDS ON OUR

ABILITY TO NAVIGATE THIS ENVIRONMENT, BY IMPROVING OUR PRODUCTS

AND PROCESSES FASTER THAN OUR COMPETITORS, ANTICIPATING CHANGING

CUSTOMER REQUIREMENTS, DEVELOPING AND LAUNCHING NEW PRODUCTS AND

PLATFORMS, PRICING OUR PRODUCTS COMPETITIVELY, AND REDUCING

AVERAGE UNIT COSTS. SEE RISK FACTORS IN PART I, ITEM

1A OF THIS FORM

OUR PRODUCTS COMPETE PRIMARILY

BASED ON PERFORMANCE, FEATURES, PRICE, QUALITY, RELIABILITY,

BRAND RECOGNITION, AND AVAILABILITY. WE ARE FOCUSED ON OFFERING

INNOVATIVE PRODUCTS AND WORLDWIDE SUPPORT FOR OUR CUSTOMERS AT

COMPETITIVE PRICES, INCLUDING PROVIDING IMPROVED

ENERGY-EFFICIENT PERFORMANCE, ENHANCED SECURITY, MANAGEABILITY,

AND INTEGRATED SOLUTIONS. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR PLATFORM STRATEGY

PROVIDES US WITH A COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE. WE OFFER PLATFORMS

TABLE OF CONTENTS

WE BELIEVE THAT OUR NETWORK OF

MANUFACTURING FACILITIES AND ASSEMBLY AND TEST FACILITIES GIVES

US A COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE. THIS NETWORK ENABLES US TO HAVE MORE

DIRECT CONTROL OVER OUR PROCESSES, QUALITY CONTROL, PRODUCT

COST, VOLUME, TIMING OF PRODUCTION, AND OTHER FACTORS. THESE

FACILITIES REQUIRE SIGNIFICANT UP-FRONT CAPITAL SPENDING AND

THEREFORE MAKE IT DIFFICULT FOR US TO REDUCE OUR COSTS IN THE

SHORT-TERM. MANY OF OUR COMPETITORS DO NOT OWN SUCH FACILITIES

BECAUSE THEY MAY NOT BE ABLE TO AFFORD TO DO SO OR BECAUSE THEIR

BUSINESS MODELS INVOLVE THE USE OF THIRD-PARTY FOUNDRIES AND

ASSEMBLY AND TEST SUBCONTRACTORS FOR MANUFACTURING AND ASSEMBLY

AND TEST. THE THIRD-PARTY FOUNDRIES AND SUBCONTRACTORS MAY ALSO

OFFER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, DESIGN SERVICES, AND OTHER GOODS

AND SERVICES TO OUR COMPETITORS. THESE FABLESS

SEMICONDUCTOR COMPANIES INCLUDE BROADCOM CORPORATION,

NVIDIA CORPORATION, QUALCOMM INCORPORATED, AND VIA TECHNOLOGIES,

INC. (VIA). SOME OF OUR COMPETITORS OWN PORTIONS OF SUCH

FACILITIES THROUGH INVESTMENT OR JOINT-VENTURE ARRANGEMENTS WITH

OTHER COMPANIES.

WE PLAN TO CONTINUE TO CULTIVATE

NEW BUSINESSES AND WORK WITH THE COMPUTING AND COMMUNICATIONS

INDUSTRIES THROUGH STANDARDS BODIES, TRADE ASSOCIATIONS, OEMS,

ODMS, AND INDEPENDENT SOFTWARE AND OPERATING SYSTEM VENDORS TO

HELP ALIGN THE INDUSTRY TO OFFER PRODUCTS THAT TAKE ADVANTAGE OF

THE LATEST MARKET TRENDS AND USAGE MODELS. WE FREQUENTLY

PARTICIPATE IN INDUSTRY INITIATIVES DESIGNED TO DISCUSS AND

AGREE UPON TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS AND OTHER ASPECTS OF

TECHNOLOGIES THAT COULD BE ADOPTED AS STANDARDS BY

STANDARDS-SETTING ORGANIZATIONS. OUR COMPETITORS MAY ALSO

PARTICIPATE IN THE SAME INITIATIVES AND SPECIFICATION

DEVELOPMENT. OUR PARTICIPATION DOES NOT ENSURE THAT ANY

STANDARDS OR SPECIFICATIONS ADOPTED BY THESE ORGANIZATIONS WILL

BE CONSISTENT WITH OUR PRODUCT PLANNING.

MICROPROCESSORS

WE CONTINUE TO BE LARGELY

DEPENDENT ON THE SUCCESS OF OUR MICROPROCESSOR BUSINESS. OUR

ABILITY TO COMPETE DEPENDS ON OUR ABILITY TO DELIVER NEW

MICROPROCESSOR PRODUCTS WITH INCREASED PERFORMANCE CAPABILITIES

AND IMPROVED ENERGY-EFFICIENT PERFORMANCE AT COMPETITIVE PRICES.

SOME OF OUR MICROPROCESSOR COMPETITORS, SUCH AS ADVANCED MICRO

DEVICES, INC. (AMD), MARKET SOFTWARE-COMPATIBLE PRODUCTS THAT

COMPETE WITH OUR PROCESSORS. WE ALSO FACE COMPETITION FROM

COMPANIES OFFERING RIVAL ARCHITECTURE DESIGNS, SUCH AS CELL

BROADBAND ENGINE ARCHITECTURE DEVELOPED JOINTLY BY INTERNATIONAL

BUSINESS MACHINES CORPORATION (IBM), SONY CORPORATION, AND

TOSHIBA CORPORATION; POWER ARCHITECTURE* OFFERED BY IBM; ARM*

ARCHITECTURE DEVELOPED BY ARM LIMITED; AND SCALABLE PROCESSOR

ARCHITECTURE (SPARC*) OFFERED BY SUN MICROSYSTEMS, INC. (A

SUBSIDIARY OF ORACLE CORPORATION). IN ADDITION, NVIDIA IS

SEEKING TO POSITION ITS GRAPHICS PROCESSORS TO COMPETE WITH

MICROPROCESSORS, BY SHIFTING SOME OF A MICROPROCESSORS

WORKLOAD TO ITS GRAPHICS PROCESSOR.

WHILE AMD HAS BEEN OUR PRIMARY

COMPETITOR IN THE MARKET SEGMENTS FOR MICROPROCESSORS USED IN

NOTEBOOKS, DESKTOPS, AND SERVERS, QUALCOMM AND OTHER COMPANIES

USING ARM-BASED DESIGNS ARE OUR PRIMARY COMPETITORS IN THE

GROWING MARKET SEGMENT FOR MICROPROCESSORS USED IN HANDHELDS,

INCLUDING SMARTPHONES AND MIDS. OUR ABILITY TO COMPETE WITH

QUALCOMM AND OTHER COMPETITORS IN THIS MARKET SEGMENT DEPENDS ON

OUR ABILITY TO DESIGN AND PRODUCE HIGH-PERFORMANCE,

ENERGY-EFFICIENT MICROPROCESSORS AT COMPETITIVE PRICES. IT ALSO

REQUIRES US TO DEVELOP A SOFTWARE ECOSYSTEM THAT APPEALS TO END

USERS AND SOFTWARE DEVELOPERS. WE HAVE TAKEN A NUMBER OF STEPS

TO BUILD THIS SOFTWARE ECOSYSTEM, INCLUDING DEVELOPING THE

MOBLIN

TM

-BASED

OPERATING SYSTEM AND SUBSEQUENTLY COMBINING IT WITH NOKIA

WE HAVE FILED AND OBTAINED A

NUMBER OF PATENTS IN THE U.S. AND OTHER COUNTRIES. WHILE OUR

PATENTS ARE AN IMPORTANT ELEMENT OF OUR SUCCESS, OUR BUSINESS AS

A WHOLE IS NOT SIGNIFICANTLY DEPENDENT ON ANY ONE PATENT. WE AND

OTHER COMPANIES IN THE COMPUTING, TELECOMMUNICATIONS, AND

RELATED HIGH-TECHNOLOGY FIELDS TYPICALLY APPLY FOR AND RECEIVE,

IN THE AGGREGATE, TENS OF THOUSANDS OF OVERLAPPING PATENTS

ANNUALLY IN THE U.S. AND OTHER COUNTRIES. WE BELIEVE THAT THE

DURATION OF THE APPLICABLE PATENTS THAT WE ARE GRANTED IS

ADEQUATE RELATIVE TO THE EXPECTED LIVES OF OUR PRODUCTS. BECAUSE

OF THE FAST PACE OF INNOVATION AND PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT, OUR

PRODUCTS ARE OFTEN OBSOLETE BEFORE THE PATENTS RELATED TO THEM

EXPIRE, AND SOMETIMES ARE OBSOLETE BEFORE THE PATENTS RELATED TO

THEM ARE EVEN GRANTED. AS WE EXPAND OUR PRODUCT OFFERINGS INTO

NEW INDUSTRIES, WE ALSO SEEK TO EXTEND OUR PATENT DEVELOPMENT

EFFORTS TO PATENT SUCH PRODUCT OFFERINGS. ESTABLISHED

COMPETITORS IN EXISTING AND NEW INDUSTRIES, AS WELL AS COMPANIES

THAT PURCHASE AND ENFORCE PATENTS AND OTHER INTELLECTUAL

PROPERTY, MAY ALREADY HAVE PATENTS COVERING SIMILAR PRODUCTS.

THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO OBTAIN PATENTS

COVERING OUR OWN PRODUCTS, OR THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO OBTAIN

LICENSES FROM SUCH COMPANIES ON FAVORABLE TERMS OR AT ALL.

THE MAJORITY OF THE SOFTWARE THAT

WE DISTRIBUTE, INCLUDING SOFTWARE EMBEDDED IN OUR COMPONENT- AND

SYSTEM-LEVEL PRODUCTS, IS ENTITLED TO COPYRIGHT PROTECTION. TO

DISTINGUISH INTEL PRODUCTS FROM OUR COMPETITORS PRODUCTS,

WE HAVE OBTAINED CERTAIN TRADEMARKS AND TRADE NAMES FOR OUR

PRODUCT DESIGN; CHEMICAL, ENERGY, AND WATER USE; CLIMATE CHANGE;

WASTE RECYCLING; AND EMISSIONS.

12

TABLE OF CONTENTS

INTEL FOCUSES ON REDUCING NATURAL

RESOURCE USE, THE SOLID AND CHEMICAL WASTE BY-PRODUCTS OF OUR

MANUFACTURING PROCESSES, AND THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT OF OUR

PRODUCTS. WE CURRENTLY USE A VARIETY OF MATERIALS IN OUR

MANUFACTURING PROCESS THAT HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO ADVERSELY

IMPACT THE ENVIRONMENT AND ARE SUBJECT TO A VARIETY OF EHS LAWS

AND REGULATIONS. FOR EXAMPLE, LEAD AND HALOGENATED MATERIALS

(SUCH AS CERTAIN FLAME RETARDANTS AND PLASTICS) HAVE BEEN USED

BY THE ELECTRONICS INDUSTRY FOR DECADES. FINDING SUITABLE

REPLACEMENTS HAS BEEN A TECHNICAL CHALLENGE FOR THE INDUSTRY,

AND WE HAVE WORKED FOR YEARS WITH OUR SUPPLIERS AND OTHERS IN

THE INDUSTRY TO DEVELOP LEAD-FREE AND HALOGEN-FREE SOLUTIONS.

WE WORK WITH THE U.S.

ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY (EPA), NON-GOVERNMENTAL

ORGANIZATIONS, OEMS, AND RETAILERS TO HELP MANAGE

E-WASTE

(WHICH INCLUDES ELECTRONIC PRODUCTS NEARING THE END OF THEIR

USEFUL LIVES) AND PROMOTE RECYCLING. THE EUROPEAN UNION (EU)

REQUIRES PRODUCERS OF CERTAIN ELECTRICAL AND ELECTRONIC

EQUIPMENT TO DEVELOP PROGRAMS THAT ALLOW CONSUMERS TO RETURN

PRODUCTS FOR RECYCLING. MANY STATES IN THE U.S. HAVE SIMILAR

E-WASTE

TAKE-BACK LAWS. THE INCONSISTENCY OF MANY

E-WASTE

TAKE-BACK LAWS AND THE LACK OF LOCAL

E-WASTE

MANAGEMENT OPTIONS IN MANY AREAS POSE A CHALLENGE FOR OUR

COMPLIANCE EFFORTS. TO MITIGATE THESE PROBLEMS, WE COMMUNICATE

WITH OUR DISTRIBUTORS TO DETERMINE AVAILABLE OPTIONS FOR

COMPLYING WITH

E-WASTE

LAWS.

INTEL SEEKS TO REDUCE OUR GLOBAL

GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS BY INVESTING IN ENERGY CONSERVATION

PROJECTS IN OUR FACTORIES AND WORKING WITH SUPPLIERS TO IMPROVE

ENERGY EFFICIENCY. WE TAKE A HOLISTIC APPROACH TO POWER

MANAGEMENT, ADDRESSING THE CHALLENGE AT THE SILICON, PACKAGE,

CIRCUIT, MICRO/MACRO ARCHITECTURE, PLATFORM, AND SOFTWARE

LEVELS. WE RECOGNIZE THAT CLIMATE CHANGE MAY CAUSE GENERAL

ECONOMIC RISK. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ON THE RISKS OF CLIMATE

CHANGE, SEE RISK FACTORS IN PART I, ITEM 1A OF THIS

FORM

10-K.

WE ROUTINELY MONITOR ENERGY COSTS TO UNDERSTAND THE LONG-RANGE

IMPACTS THAT RISING COSTS MAY HAVE ON OUR BUSINESS. WE SEE THE

POTENTIAL FOR HIGHER ENERGY COSTS DRIVEN BY CLIMATE CHANGE

REGULATIONS. THIS COULD INCLUDE ITEMS APPLIED TO UTILITIES THAT

ARE PASSED ALONG TO CUSTOMERS, SUCH AS CARBON TAXES OR COSTS

ASSOCIATED WITH EMISSION CAP AND TRADE PROGRAMS OR RENEWABLE

PORTFOLIO STANDARDS. IN PARTICULAR, REGULATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH

THE WESTERN CLIMATE INITIATIVE COULD HAVE AN IMPACT ON OUR

COMPANY, BECAUSE A NUMBER OF OUR LARGE MANUFACTURING FACILITIES

ARE LOCATED IN THE WESTERN U.S. PROPOSED REGULATIONS BY THE EPA

COULD IMPACT OUR ABILITY TO OBTAIN MODIFICATIONS IN A TIMELY

MANNER FOR EXISTING AIR PERMITS AT OUR MANUFACTURING FACILITIES

IN THE U.S. SIMILARLY, OUR OPERATIONS IN IRELAND ARE ALREADY

SUBJECT TO THE EUS MANDATORY CAP AND TRADE SCHEME FOR

GLOBAL-WARMING EMISSIONS. ALL OF OUR SITES ALSO MAY BE IMPACTED

BY UTILITY PROGRAMS DIRECTED BY LEGISLATION OR REGULATORY OR

OTHER PRESSURES THAT ARE TARGETED TO PASS COSTS THROUGH TO USERS.

WE MAINTAIN BUSINESS RECOVERY

PLANS THAT ARE INTENDED TO ENSURE OUR ABILITY TO RECOVER FROM

NATURAL DISASTERS OR OTHER EVENTS THAT CAN BE DISRUPTIVE TO OUR

BUSINESS. MANY OF OUR OPERATIONS ARE LOCATED IN SEMI-ARID

REGIONS, SUCH AS ISRAEL AND THE SOUTHWESTERN U.S. SOME CLIMATE

CHANGE SCENARIOS PREDICT THAT SUCH REGIONS CAN BECOME EVEN MORE

VULNERABLE TO PROLONGED DROUGHTS. WE HAVE HAD AN AGGRESSIVE

WATER CONSERVATION PROGRAM IN PLACE FOR MANY YEARS. WE BELIEVE

THAT OUR WATER CONSERVATION AND RECOVERY PROGRAMS WILL HELP

REDUCE OUR RISK IF WATER AVAILABILITY BECOMES MORE CONSTRAINED

IN THE FUTURE. WE FURTHER MAINTAIN LONG-RANGE PLANS TO IDENTIFY

POTENTIAL FUTURE WATER CONSERVATION ACTIONS THAT WE CAN TAKE.

WE ARE COMMITTED TO SUSTAINABILITY

AND TAKE A LEADERSHIP POSITION IN PROMOTING VOLUNTARY

ENVIRONMENTAL INITIATIVES AND WORKING PROACTIVELY WITH

GOVERNMENTS, ENVIRONMENTAL GROUPS, AND INDUSTRY TO PROMOTE

GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY. WE BELIEVE THAT TECHNOLOGY

WILL BE FUNDAMENTAL TO FINDING SOLUTIONS TO THE WORLDS

ENVIRONMENTAL CHALLENGES, AND WE ARE JOINING FORCES WITH

INDUSTRY, BUSINESS, AND GOVERNMENTS TO FIND AND PROMOTE WAYS

THAT TECHNOLOGY CAN BE USED AS A TOOL TO COMBAT CLIMATE CHANGE.

FOR SEVERAL YEARS, WE HAVE BEEN

EVALUATING GREEN DESIGN STANDARDS AND INCORPORATING

GREEN BUILDING CONCEPTS AND PRACTICES INTO THE CONSTRUCTION OF

OUR BUILDINGS. WE ARE IN THE PROCESS OF OBTAINING LEADERSHIP IN

ENERGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL DESIGN (LEED) CERTIFICATION FOR AN

OFFICE BUILDING UNDER CONSTRUCTION IN ISRAEL AND A NEWLY

CONSTRUCTED FABRICATION BUILDING IN ARIZONA. WE HAVE BEEN

PURCHASING WIND POWER AND OTHER FORMS OF RENEWABLE ENERGY AT

SOME OF OUR MAJOR SITES FOR SEVERAL YEARS. AT THE BEGINNING OF

2008, WE ANNOUNCED PLANS TO PURCHASE RENEWABLE ENERGY

CERTIFICATES UNDER A MULTI-YEAR CONTRACT. THE PURCHASE PLACED

INTEL AT THE TOP OF THE EPAS GREEN POWER PARTNERSHIP FOR

2008 AND 2009. THE PURCHASE WAS INTENDED TO HELP STIMULATE THE

MARKET FOR GREEN POWER, LEADING TO ADDITIONAL GENERATING

CAPACITY AND, ULTIMATELY, LOWER COSTS.

RISK

FACTORS

FLUCTUATIONS

IN DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS MAY HARM OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS AND

ARE DIFFICULT TO FORECAST.

IF DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS

FLUCTUATES AS A RESULT OF ECONOMIC CONDITIONS OR FOR OTHER

REASONS, OUR REVENUE AND PROFITABILITY COULD BE HARMED.

IMPORTANT FACTORS THAT COULD CAUSE DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS TO

FLUCTUATE INCLUDE.



CHANGES IN BUSINESS AND ECONOMIC

CONDITIONS, INCLUDING DOWNTURNS IN THE SEMICONDUCTOR INDUSTRY

AND/OR

THE

OVERALL ECONOMY;



CHANGES IN CONSUMER CONFIDENCE

CAUSED BY CHANGES IN MARKET CONDITIONS, INCLUDING CHANGES IN THE

CREDIT MARKET, EXPECTATIONS FOR INFLATION, AND ENERGY PRICES;



CHANGES IN THE LEVEL OF

CUSTOMERS COMPONENTS INVENTORIES;



COMPETITIVE PRESSURES, INCLUDING

PRICING PRESSURES, FROM COMPANIES THAT HAVE COMPETING PRODUCTS,

CHIP ARCHITECTURES, MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGIES, AND MARKETING

PROGRAMS;



CHANGES IN CUSTOMER PRODUCT NEEDS;



STRATEGIC ACTIONS TAKEN BY OUR

COMPETITORS; AND



MARKET ACCEPTANCE OF OUR PRODUCTS.

IF PRODUCT DEMAND DECREASES, OUR

MANUFACTURING OR ASSEMBLY AND TEST CAPACITY COULD BE

UNDERUTILIZED, AND WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO RECORD AN IMPAIRMENT ON

OUR LONG-LIVED ASSETS, INCLUDING FACILITIES AND EQUIPMENT AS

WELL AS INTANGIBLE ASSETS, WHICH WOULD INCREASE OUR EXPENSES. IN

ADDITION, IF PRODUCT DEMAND DECREASES OR WE FAIL TO FORECAST

DEMAND ACCURATELY, WE COULD BE REQUIRED TO WRITE OFF INVENTORY

OR RECORD UNDERUTILIZATION CHARGES, WHICH WOULD HAVE A NEGATIVE

IMPACT ON OUR GROSS MARGIN. FACTORY-PLANNING DECISIONS MAY

SHORTEN THE USEFUL LIVES OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS, INCLUDING

FACILITIES AND EQUIPMENT, AND CAUSE US TO ACCELERATE

DEPRECIATION. IN THE LONG TERM, IF PRODUCT DEMAND INCREASES, WE

MAY NOT BE ABLE TO ADD MANUFACTURING OR ASSEMBLY AND TEST

CAPACITY FAST ENOUGH TO MEET MARKET DEMAND. THESE CHANGES IN

DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS, AND CHANGES IN OUR CUSTOMERS

PRODUCT NEEDS, COULD HAVE A VARIETY OF NEGATIVE EFFECTS ON OUR

COMPETITIVE POSITION AND OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS, AND, IN CERTAIN

CASES, MAY REDUCE OUR REVENUE, INCREASE OUR COSTS, LOWER OUR

GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE, OR REQUIRE US TO RECOGNIZE IMPAIRMENTS

OF OUR ASSETS.

LITIGATION

OR REGULATORY PROCEEDINGS COULD HARM OUR BUSINESS.

WE MAY BE SUBJECT TO LEGAL CLAIMS

OR REGULATORY MATTERS INVOLVING STOCKHOLDER, CONSUMER,

COMPETITION, AND OTHER ISSUES ON A GLOBAL BASIS. AS DESCRIBED IN

NOTE 28: CONTINGENCIES IN PART II, ITEM 8 OF THIS

FORM

10-K,

WE ARE CURRENTLY ENGAGED IN A NUMBER OF LITIGATION AND

REGULATORY MATTERS, PARTICULARLY WITH RESPECT TO COMPETITION.

LITIGATION AND REGULATORY PROCEEDINGS ARE SUBJECT TO INHERENT

UNCERTAINTIES, AND UNFAVORABLE RULINGS COULD OCCUR. AN

UNFAVORABLE RULING COULD INCLUDE MONETARY DAMAGES OR, IN CASES

FOR WHICH INJUNCTIVE RELIEF IS SOUGHT, AN INJUNCTION PROHIBITING

US FROM MANUFACTURING OR SELLING ONE OR MORE PRODUCTS,

PRECLUDING PARTICULAR BUSINESS PRACTICES, OR REQUIRING OTHER

REMEDIES, SUCH AS COMPULSORY LICENSING OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY.

IF WE WERE TO RECEIVE AN UNFAVORABLE RULING IN A MATTER, OUR

BUSINESS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COULD BE MATERIALLY HARMED.

THE

SEMICONDUCTOR INDUSTRY AND OUR OPERATIONS ARE CHARACTERIZED BY A

HIGH PERCENTAGE OF COSTS THAT ARE FIXED OR DIFFICULT TO REDUCE

IN THE SHORT TERM, AND BY PRODUCT DEMAND THAT IS HIGHLY VARIABLE

AND SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT DOWNTURNS THAT MAY HARM OUR BUSINESS,

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

THE SEMICONDUCTOR INDUSTRY AND OUR

OPERATIONS ARE CHARACTERIZED BY HIGH COSTS, SUCH AS THOSE

RELATED TO FACILITY CONSTRUCTION AND EQUIPMENT, R&D, AND

EMPLOYMENT AND TRAINING OF A HIGHLY SKILLED WORKFORCE, THAT ARE

EITHER FIXED OR DIFFICULT TO REDUCE IN THE SHORT TERM. AT THE

SAME TIME, DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS IS HIGHLY VARIABLE AND THERE

HAVE BEEN DOWNTURNS, OFTEN IN CONNECTION WITH MATURING PRODUCT

CYCLES AS WELL AS DOWNTURNS IN GENERAL ECONOMIC MARKET

CONDITIONS. THESE DOWNTURNS HAVE BEEN CHARACTERIZED BY REDUCED

PRODUCT DEMAND, MANUFACTURING OVERCAPACITY AND RESULTING

UNDERUTILIZATION CHARGES, HIGH INVENTORY LEVELS, AND LOWER

AVERAGE SELLING PRICES. THE COMBINATION OF THESE FACTORS MAY

CAUSE OUR REVENUE, GROSS MARGIN, CASH FLOW, AND PROFITABILITY TO

VARY SIGNIFICANTLY IN BOTH THE SHORT AND LONG TERM.

15

TABLE OF CONTENTS

WE

OPERATE IN INTENSELY COMPETITIVE INDUSTRIES, AND OUR FAILURE TO

RESPOND QUICKLY TO TECHNOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENTS AND INCORPORATE

NEW FEATURES INTO OUR PRODUCTS COULD HARM OUR ABILITY TO

COMPETE.

WE OPERATE IN INTENSELY

COMPETITIVE INDUSTRIES THAT EXPERIENCE RAPID TECHNOLOGICAL

DEVELOPMENTS, CHANGES IN INDUSTRY STANDARDS, CHANGES IN CUSTOMER

REQUIREMENTS, AND FREQUENT NEW PRODUCT INTRODUCTIONS AND

IMPROVEMENTS. IF WE ARE UNABLE TO RESPOND QUICKLY AND

SUCCESSFULLY TO THESE DEVELOPMENTS, WE MAY LOSE OUR COMPETITIVE

POSITION, AND OUR PRODUCTS OR TECHNOLOGIES MAY BECOME

UNCOMPETITIVE OR OBSOLETE. TO COMPETE SUCCESSFULLY, WE MUST

MAINTAIN A SUCCESSFUL R&D EFFORT, DEVELOP NEW PRODUCTS AND

PRODUCTION PROCESSES, AND IMPROVE OUR EXISTING PRODUCTS AND

PROCESSES AT THE SAME PACE OR AHEAD OF OUR COMPETITORS. OUR

R&D EFFORTS ARE AIMED AT SOLVING INCREASINGLY COMPLEX

PROBLEMS, AND WE DO NOT EXPECT THAT ALL OF OUR PROJECTS WILL BE

SUCCESSFUL. IF OUR R&D EFFORTS ARE UNSUCCESSFUL, OUR FUTURE

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COULD BE MATERIALLY HARMED. WE MAY NOT BE

ABLE TO DEVELOP AND MARKET THESE NEW PRODUCTS SUCCESSFULLY, THE

PRODUCTS WE INVEST IN AND DEVELOP MAY NOT BE WELL RECEIVED BY

CUSTOMERS, AND PRODUCTS DEVELOPED AND NEW TECHNOLOGIES OFFERED

BY OTHERS MAY AFFECT DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS. THESE TYPES OF

EVENTS COULD HAVE A VARIETY OF NEGATIVE EFFECTS ON OUR

COMPETITIVE POSITION AND OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS, SUCH AS REDUCING

OUR REVENUE, INCREASING OUR COSTS, LOWERING OUR GROSS MARGIN

PERCENTAGE, AND REQUIRING US TO RECOGNIZE IMPAIRMENTS ON OUR

ASSETS.

WE

INVEST IN COMPANIES FOR STRATEGIC REASONS AND MAY NOT REALIZE A

RETURN ON OUR INVESTMENTS.

WE MAKE INVESTMENTS IN COMPANIES

AROUND THE WORLD TO FURTHER OUR STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES AND SUPPORT

OUR KEY BUSINESS INITIATIVES. SUCH INVESTMENTS INCLUDE EQUITY OR

DEBT INSTRUMENTS OF PUBLIC OR PRIVATE COMPANIES, AND MANY OF

THESE INSTRUMENTS ARE NON-MARKETABLE AT THE TIME OF OUR INITIAL

INVESTMENT. THESE COMPANIES RANGE FROM EARLY-STAGE COMPANIES

THAT ARE OFTEN STILL DEFINING THEIR STRATEGIC DIRECTION TO MORE

MATURE COMPANIES WITH ESTABLISHED REVENUE STREAMS AND BUSINESS

MODELS. THE SUCCESS OF THESE COMPANIES IS DEPENDENT ON PRODUCT

DEVELOPMENT, MARKET ACCEPTANCE, OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCY, AND

OTHER KEY BUSINESS FACTORS. THE COMPANIES IN WHICH WE INVEST MAY

FAIL BECAUSE THEY MAY NOT BE ABLE TO SECURE ADDITIONAL FUNDING,

OBTAIN FAVORABLE INVESTMENT TERMS FOR FUTURE FINANCINGS, OR TAKE

ADVANTAGE OF LIQUIDITY EVENTS SUCH AS PUBLIC OFFERINGS, MERGERS,

AND PRIVATE SALES. IF ANY OF THESE PRIVATE COMPANIES FAIL, WE

COULD LOSE ALL OR PART OF OUR INVESTMENT IN THAT COMPANY. IF WE

DETERMINE THAT AN

OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY

DECLINE IN THE FAIR VALUE EXISTS FOR AN EQUITY OR DEBT

INVESTMENT IN A PUBLIC OR PRIVATE COMPANY IN WHICH WE HAVE

INVESTED, WE WRITE DOWN THE INVESTMENT TO ITS FAIR VALUE AND

RECOGNIZE THE RELATED

WRITE-DOWN

AS AN INVESTMENT LOSS. WE HAVE SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS IN

COMPANIES IN THE FLASH MEMORY MARKET SEGMENT, AND DECLINES IN

THIS MARKET SEGMENT OR CHANGES IN MANAGEMENTS PLANS WITH

RESPECT TO OUR INVESTMENTS IN THIS MARKET SEGMENT COULD RESULT

IN SIGNIFICANT IMPAIRMENT CHARGES, IMPACTING GAINS (LOSSES) ON

EQUITY METHOD INVESTMENTS AND GAINS (LOSSES) ON OTHER EQUITY

INVESTMENTS.

FURTHERMORE, WHEN THE STRATEGIC

OBJECTIVES OF AN INVESTMENT HAVE BEEN ACHIEVED, OR IF THE

INVESTMENT OR BUSINESS DIVERGES FROM OUR STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES,

WE MAY DECIDE TO DISPOSE OF THE INVESTMENT. OUR NON-MARKETABLE

EQUITY INVESTMENTS IN PRIVATE COMPANIES ARE NOT LIQUID, AND WE

MAY NOT BE ABLE TO DISPOSE OF THESE INVESTMENTS ON FAVORABLE

TERMS OR AT ALL. THE OCCURRENCE OF ANY OF THESE EVENTS COULD

HARM OUR RESULTS. ADDITIONALLY, FOR CASES IN WHICH WE ARE

REQUIRED UNDER EQUITY METHOD ACCOUNTING TO RECOGNIZE A

PROPORTIONATE SHARE OF ANOTHER COMPANYS INCOME OR LOSS,

SUCH INCOME OR LOSS MAY IMPACT OUR EARNINGS. GAINS OR LOSSES

FROM EQUITY SECURITIES COULD VARY FROM EXPECTATIONS DEPENDING ON

GAINS OR LOSSES REALIZED ON THE SALE OR EXCHANGE OF SECURITIES,

GAINS OR LOSSES FROM EQUITY METHOD INVESTMENTS, AND IMPAIRMENT

CHARGES RELATED TO DEBT INSTRUMENTS AS WELL AS EQUITY AND OTHER

INVESTMENTS.

OUR

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COULD VARY AS A RESULT OF THE METHODS,

ESTIMATES, AND JUDGMENTS THAT WE USE IN APPLYING OUR ACCOUNTING

POLICIES.

THE METHODS, ESTIMATES, AND

JUDGMENTS THAT WE USE IN APPLYING OUR ACCOUNTING POLICIES HAVE A

SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (SEE

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES IN PART II, ITEM 7 OF

THIS FORM

10-K).

SUCH

METHODS, ESTIMATES, AND JUDGMENTS ARE, BY THEIR NATURE, SUBJECT

TO SUBSTANTIAL RISKS, UNCERTAINTIES, AND ASSUMPTIONS, AND

FACTORS MAY ARISE OVER TIME THAT LEAD US TO CHANGE OUR METHODS,

ESTIMATES, AND JUDGMENTS. CHANGES IN THOSE METHODS, ESTIMATES,

AND JUDGMENTS COULD SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS.

FLUCTUATIONS

IN THE MIX OF PRODUCTS SOLD MAY HARM OUR FINANCIAL

RESULTS.

BECAUSE OF THE WIDE PRICE

DIFFERENCES AMONG AND WITHIN NOTEBOOK, NETBOOK, DESKTOP, AND

SERVER MICROPROCESSORS, THE MIX AND TYPES OF PERFORMANCE

CAPABILITIES OF MICROPROCESSORS SOLD AFFECT THE AVERAGE SELLING

PRICE OF OUR PRODUCTS AND HAVE A SUBSTANTIAL IMPACT ON OUR

REVENUE AND GROSS MARGIN. OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS ALSO DEPEND IN

PART ON THE MIX OF OTHER PRODUCTS THAT WE SELL, SUCH AS

CHIPSETS, FLASH MEMORY, AND OTHER SEMICONDUCTOR PRODUCTS. IN

ADDITION, MORE RECENTLY INTRODUCED PRODUCTS TEND TO HAVE HIGHER

ASSOCIATED COSTS BECAUSE OF INITIAL OVERALL DEVELOPMENT AND

PRODUCTION RAMP. FLUCTUATIONS IN THE MIX AND TYPES OF OUR

PRODUCTS MAY ALSO AFFECT THE EXTENT TO WHICH WE ARE ABLE TO

RECOVER THE FIXED COSTS AND INVESTMENTS ASSOCIATED WITH A

PARTICULAR PRODUCT, AND AS A RESULT CAN HARM OUR FINANCIAL

RESULTS.

16

TABLE OF CONTENTS

OUR

GLOBAL OPERATIONS SUBJECT US TO RISKS THAT MAY HARM OUR RESULTS

OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

WE HAVE SALES OFFICES, R&D,

MANUFACTURING, AND ASSEMBLY AND TEST FACILITIES IN MANY

COUNTRIES, AND AS A RESULT, WE ARE SUBJECT TO RISKS THAT MAY

LIMIT OUR ABILITY TO MANUFACTURE, ASSEMBLE AND TEST, DESIGN,

DEVELOP, OR SELL PRODUCTS IN PARTICULAR COUNTRIES, WHICH COULD,

IN TURN, HARM OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION,

INCLUDING.



SECURITY CONCERNS, SUCH AS ARMED

CONFLICT AND CIVIL OR MILITARY UNREST, CRIME, POLITICAL

INSTABILITY, AND TERRORIST ACTIVITY;



HEALTH CONCERNS;



NATURAL DISASTERS;



INEFFICIENT AND LIMITED

INFRASTRUCTURE AND DISRUPTIONS, SUCH AS LARGE-SCALE OUTAGES OR

INTERRUPTIONS OF SERVICE FROM UTILITIES OR TELECOMMUNICATIONS

PROVIDERS AND SUPPLY CHAIN INTERRUPTIONS;



DIFFERING EMPLOYMENT PRACTICES AND

LABOR ISSUES;



LOCAL BUSINESS AND CULTURAL

FACTORS THAT DIFFER FROM OUR NORMAL STANDARDS AND PRACTICES;



REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS AND

PROHIBITIONS THAT DIFFER BETWEEN JURISDICTIONS; AND



RESTRICTIONS ON OUR OPERATIONS BY

GOVERNMENTS SEEKING TO SUPPORT LOCAL INDUSTRIES, NATIONALIZATION

OF OUR OPERATIONS, AND RESTRICTIONS ON OUR ABILITY TO REPATRIATE

EARNINGS.

IN ADDITION, ALTHOUGH

SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR PRODUCTS ARE SOLD IN U.S. DOLLARS, WE

INCUR A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF CERTAIN TYPES OF EXPENSES, SUCH AS

PAYROLL, UTILITIES, TAX, AND MARKETING EXPENSES, AS WELL AS

CONDUCT CERTAIN INVESTING AND FINANCING ACTIVITIES, IN LOCAL

CURRENCIES. OUR HEDGING PROGRAMS REDUCE, BUT DO NOT ENTIRELY

ELIMINATE, THE IMPACT OF CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE MOVEMENTS, AND

THEREFORE FLUCTUATIONS IN EXCHANGE RATES COULD HARM OUR RESULTS

OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. IN ADDITION, CHANGES IN

TARIFF AND IMPORT REGULATIONS AND IN U.S. AND

NON-U.S.

MONETARY POLICIES MAY HARM OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND

FINANCIAL CONDITION BY INCREASING OUR EXPENSES AND REDUCING OUR

REVENUE. VARYING TAX RATES IN DIFFERENT JURISDICTIONS COULD HARM

OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION BY INCREASING

OUR OVERALL TAX RATE.

WE MAINTAIN A PROGRAM OF INSURANCE

COVERAGE FOR VARIOUS TYPES OF PROPERTY, CASUALTY, AND OTHER

RISKS. WE PLACE OUR INSURANCE COVERAGE WITH VARIOUS CARRIERS IN

NUMEROUS JURISDICTIONS. HOWEVER, THERE IS A RISK THAT ONE OR

MORE OF OUR INSURANCE PROVIDERS MAY BE UNABLE TO PAY A CLAIM.

THE TYPES AND AMOUNTS OF INSURANCE THAT WE OBTAIN VARY FROM TIME

TO TIME AND FROM LOCATION TO LOCATION, DEPENDING ON

AVAILABILITY, COST, AND OUR DECISIONS WITH RESPECT TO RISK

RETENTION. THE POLICIES ARE SUBJECT TO DEDUCTIBLES AND

EXCLUSIONS THAT RESULT IN OUR RETENTION OF A LEVEL OF RISK ON A

SELF-INSURANCE BASIS. LOSSES NOT COVERED BY INSURANCE MAY BE

SUBSTANTIAL AND MAY INCREASE OUR EXPENSES, WHICH COULD HARM OUR

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

FAILURE

TO MEET OUR PRODUCTION TARGETS, RESULTING IN UNDERSUPPLY OR

OVERSUPPLY OF PRODUCTS, MAY HARM OUR BUSINESS AND RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS.

PRODUCTION OF INTEGRATED CIRCUITS

IS A COMPLEX PROCESS. DISRUPTIONS IN THIS PROCESS CAN RESULT

FROM INTERRUPTIONS IN OUR PROCESSES, ERRORS, AND DIFFICULTIES IN

OUR DEVELOPMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION OF NEW PROCESSES; DEFECTS IN

MATERIALS; DISRUPTIONS IN OUR SUPPLY OF MATERIALS OR RESOURCES;

AND DISRUPTIONS AT OUR FABRICATION AND ASSEMBLY AND TEST

FACILITIES DUE TO, FOR EXAMPLE, ACCIDENTS, MAINTENANCE ISSUES,

OR UNSAFE WORKING CONDITIONSALL OF WHICH COULD AFFECT THE

TIMING OF PRODUCTION RAMPS AND YIELDS. WE MAY NOT BE SUCCESSFUL

OR EFFICIENT IN DEVELOPING OR IMPLEMENTING NEW PRODUCTION

PROCESSES. THE OCCURRENCE OF ANY OF THE FOREGOING MAY RESULT IN

OUR FAILURE TO MEET OR INCREASE PRODUCTION AS DESIRED, RESULTING

IN HIGHER COSTS OR SUBSTANTIAL DECREASES IN YIELDS, WHICH COULD

AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO PRODUCE SUFFICIENT VOLUME TO MEET SPECIFIC

PRODUCT DEMAND. THE UNAVAILABILITY OR REDUCED AVAILABILITY OF

CERTAIN PRODUCTS COULD MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT TO IMPLEMENT OUR

PLATFORM STRATEGY. WE MAY ALSO EXPERIENCE INCREASES IN YIELDS. A

SUBSTANTIAL INCREASE IN YIELDS COULD RESULT IN HIGHER INVENTORY

LEVELS AND THE POSSIBILITY OF RESULTING UNDERUTILIZATION CHARGES

AS WE SLOW PRODUCTION TO REDUCE INVENTORY LEVELS. THE OCCURRENCE

OF ANY OF THESE EVENTS COULD HARM OUR BUSINESS AND RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS.

WE MAY

HAVE DIFFICULTIES OBTAINING THE RESOURCES OR PRODUCTS WE NEED

FOR MANUFACTURING, ASSEMBLING AND TESTING OUR PRODUCTS, OR

OPERATING OTHER ASPECTS OF OUR BUSINESS, WHICH COULD HARM OUR

ABILITY TO MEET DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS AND MAY INCREASE OUR

COSTS.

WE HAVE THOUSANDS OF SUPPLIERS

PROVIDING VARIOUS MATERIALS THAT WE USE IN THE PRODUCTION OF OUR

PRODUCTS AND OTHER ASPECTS OF OUR BUSINESS, AND WE SEEK, WHERE

POSSIBLE, TO HAVE SEVERAL SOURCES OF SUPPLY FOR ALL OF THOSE

MATERIALS. HOWEVER, WE MAY RELY ON A SINGLE OR A LIMITED NUMBER

OF SUPPLIERS, OR UPON SUPPLIERS IN A SINGLE COUNTRY, FOR THESE

MATERIALS. THE INABILITY OF SUCH SUPPLIERS TO DELIVER ADEQUATE

SUPPLIES OF PRODUCTION MATERIALS OR OTHER SUPPLIES COULD DISRUPT

OUR PRODUCTION PROCESSES OR COULD MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR US

TO IMPLEMENT OUR BUSINESS STRATEGY. IN ADDITION, PRODUCTION

COULD BE DISRUPTED BY THE UNAVAILABILITY OF THE RESOURCES USED

IN PRODUCTION, SUCH AS WATER, SILICON, ELECTRICITY, AND GASES.

FUTURE ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS COULD RESTRICT THE SUPPLY OR

INCREASE THE COST OF CERTAIN OF THE MATERIALS THAT WE CURRENTLY

USE IN OUR BUSINESS. THE UNAVAILABILITY OR REDUCED AVAILABILITY

OF THE MATERIALS OR RESOURCES THAT WE USE IN OUR BUSINESS MAY

REQUIRE US TO REDUCE PRODUCTION OF PRODUCTS OR MAY REQUIRE US TO

INCUR ADDITIONAL COSTS IN ORDER TO OBTAIN AN ADEQUATE SUPPLY OF

THOSE MATERIALS OR RESOURCES. THE OCCURRENCE OF ANY OF THESE

EVENTS COULD HARM OUR BUSINESS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

17

TABLE OF CONTENTS

COSTS

RELATED TO PRODUCT DEFECTS AND ERRATA MAY HARM OUR RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS AND BUSINESS.

COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH UNEXPECTED

PRODUCT DEFECTS AND ERRATA (DEVIATIONS FROM PUBLISHED

SPECIFICATIONS) DUE TO, FOR EXAMPLE, UNANTICIPATED PROBLEMS IN

OUR MANUFACTURING PROCESSES, INCLUDE.



WRITING OFF THE VALUE OF INVENTORY

OF DEFECTIVE PRODUCTS;



DISPOSING OF DEFECTIVE PRODUCTS

THAT CANNOT BE FIXED;



RECALLING DEFECTIVE PRODUCTS THAT

HAVE BEEN SHIPPED TO CUSTOMERS;



PROVIDING PRODUCT REPLACEMENTS

FOR, OR MODIFICATIONS TO, DEFECTIVE PRODUCTS; AND/OR



DEFENDING AGAINST LITIGATION

RELATED TO DEFECTIVE PRODUCTS.

THESE COSTS COULD BE SUBSTANTIAL

AND MAY THEREFORE INCREASE OUR EXPENSES AND LOWER OUR GROSS

MARGIN. IN ADDITION, OUR REPUTATION WITH OUR CUSTOMERS OR USERS

OF OUR PRODUCTS COULD BE DAMAGED AS A RESULT OF SUCH PRODUCT

DEFECTS AND ERRATA, AND THE DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS COULD BE

REDUCED. THESE FACTORS COULD HARM OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS AND THE

PROSPECTS FOR OUR BUSINESS.

WE MAY

BE SUBJECT TO CLAIMS OF INFRINGEMENT OF THIRD-PARTY INTELLECTUAL

PROPERTY RIGHTS, WHICH COULD HARM OUR BUSINESS.

THIRD PARTIES MAY ASSERT AGAINST

US OR OUR CUSTOMERS ALLEGED PATENT, COPYRIGHT, TRADEMARK, OR

OTHER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS TO TECHNOLOGIES THAT ARE

IMPORTANT TO OUR BUSINESS. AS DESCRIBED IN NOTE 28.

CONTINGENCIES IN PART II, ITEM 8 OF THIS FORM

10-K,

WE ARE

CURRENTLY ENGAGED IN A NUMBER OF LITIGATION MATTERS INVOLVING

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS. WE MAY BE SUBJECT TO INTELLECTUAL

PROPERTY INFRINGEMENT CLAIMS FROM CERTAIN INDIVIDUALS AND

COMPANIES WHO HAVE ACQUIRED PATENT PORTFOLIOS FOR THE SOLE

PURPOSE OF ASSERTING SUCH CLAIMS AGAINST OTHER COMPANIES. ANY

CLAIMS THAT OUR PRODUCTS OR PROCESSES INFRINGE THE INTELLECTUAL

PROPERTY RIGHTS OF OTHERS, REGARDLESS OF THE MERIT OR RESOLUTION

OF SUCH CLAIMS, COULD CAUSE US TO INCUR SIGNIFICANT COSTS IN

RESPONDING TO, DEFENDING, AND RESOLVING SUCH CLAIMS, AND MAY

DIVERT THE EFFORTS AND ATTENTION OF OUR MANAGEMENT AND TECHNICAL

PERSONNEL FROM OUR BUSINESS. AS A RESULT OF SUCH INTELLECTUAL

PROPERTY INFRINGEMENT CLAIMS, WE COULD BE REQUIRED OR OTHERWISE

DECIDE THAT IT IS APPROPRIATE TO.



PAY THIRD-PARTY INFRINGEMENT

CLAIMS;



DISCONTINUE MANUFACTURING, USING,

OR SELLING PARTICULAR PRODUCTS SUBJECT TO INFRINGEMENT CLAIMS;



DISCONTINUE USING THE TECHNOLOGY

OR PROCESSES SUBJECT TO INFRINGEMENT CLAIMS;



DEVELOP OTHER TECHNOLOGY NOT

SUBJECT TO INFRINGEMENT CLAIMS, WHICH COULD BE TIME-CONSUMING

AND COSTLY OR MAY NOT BE POSSIBLE; AND/OR



LICENSE TECHNOLOGY FROM THE THIRD

PARTY CLAIMING INFRINGEMENT, WHICH LICENSE MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE

ON COMMERCIALLY REASONABLE TERMS.

THE OCCURRENCE OF ANY OF THE

FOREGOING COULD RESULT IN UNEXPECTED EXPENSES OR REQUIRE US TO

RECOGNIZE AN IMPAIRMENT OF OUR ASSETS, WHICH WOULD REDUCE THE

VALUE OF OUR ASSETS AND INCREASE EXPENSES. IN ADDITION, IF WE

ALTER OR DISCONTINUE OUR PRODUCTION OF AFFECTED ITEMS, OUR

REVENUE COULD BE HARMED.

WE MAY

NOT BE ABLE TO ENFORCE OR PROTECT OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

RIGHTS, WHICH MAY HARM OUR ABILITY TO COMPETE AND HARM OUR

BUSINESS.

OUR ABILITY TO ENFORCE OUR

PATENTS, COPYRIGHTS, SOFTWARE LICENSES, AND OTHER INTELLECTUAL

PROPERTY RIGHTS IS SUBJECT TO GENERAL LITIGATION RISKS, AS WELL

AS UNCERTAINTY AS TO THE ENFORCEABILITY OF OUR INTELLECTUAL

PROPERTY RIGHTS IN VARIOUS COUNTRIES. WHEN WE SEEK TO ENFORCE

OUR RIGHTS, WE ARE OFTEN SUBJECT TO CLAIMS THAT THE INTELLECTUAL

PROPERTY RIGHT IS INVALID, IS OTHERWISE NOT ENFORCEABLE, OR IS

LICENSED TO THE PARTY AGAINST WHOM WE ARE ASSERTING A CLAIM. IN

ADDITION, OUR ASSERTION OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS OFTEN

RESULTS IN THE OTHER PARTY SEEKING TO ASSERT ALLEGED

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS OF ITS OWN OR ASSERT OTHER CLAIMS

AGAINST US, WHICH COULD HARM OUR BUSINESS. IF WE ARE NOT

ULTIMATELY SUCCESSFUL IN DEFENDING OURSELVES AGAINST THESE

CLAIMS IN LITIGATION, WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO SELL A PARTICULAR

PRODUCT OR FAMILY OF PRODUCTS DUE TO AN INJUNCTION, OR WE MAY

HAVE TO PAY DAMAGES THAT COULD, IN TURN, HARM OUR RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS. IN ADDITION, GOVERNMENTS MAY ADOPT REGULATIONS, AND

GOVERNMENTS OR COURTS MAY RENDER DECISIONS, REQUIRING COMPULSORY

LICENSING OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY TO OTHERS, OR GOVERNMENTS MAY

REQUIRE THAT PRODUCTS MEET SPECIFIED STANDARDS THAT SERVE TO

FAVOR LOCAL COMPANIES. OUR INABILITY TO ENFORCE OUR INTELLECTUAL

PROPERTY RIGHTS UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES MAY HARM OUR

COMPETITIVE POSITION AND OUR BUSINESS.

WE MAY

BE SUBJECT TO INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY THEFT OR MISUSE, WHICH COULD

RESULT IN THIRD-PARTY CLAIMS AND HARM OUR BUSINESS AND RESULTS

WE REGULARLY FACE ATTEMPTS BY

OTHERS TO GAIN UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS THROUGH THE INTERNET TO OUR

INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS BY, FOR EXAMPLE, MASQUERADING AS

AUTHORIZED USERS OR SURREPTITIOUS INTRODUCTION OF SOFTWARE.

THESE ATTEMPTS, WHICH MIGHT BE THE RESULT OF INDUSTRIAL OR OTHER

ESPIONAGE, OR ACTIONS BY HACKERS SEEKING TO HARM THE COMPANY,

ITS PRODUCTS, OR END USERS, ARE SOMETIMES SUCCESSFUL. ONE RECENT

AND SOPHISTICATED INCIDENT OCCURRED IN JANUARY 2010 AROUND THE

SAME TIME AS THE RECENTLY PUBLICIZED SECURITY INCIDENT REPORTED

BY GOOGLE. WE SEEK TO DETECT AND INVESTIGATE THESE SECURITY

INCIDENTS AND TO PREVENT THEIR RECURRENCE, BUT IN SOME CASES WE

MIGHT BE UNAWARE OF AN INCIDENT OR ITS MAGNITUDE AND EFFECTS.

THE THEFT AND/OR UNAUTHORIZED USE OR PUBLICATION OF OUR TRADE

SECRETS AND OTHER CONFIDENTIAL BUSINESS INFORMATION AS A RESULT

OF SUCH AN INCIDENT COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR COMPETITIVE

POSITION AND REDUCE MARKETPLACE ACCEPTANCE OF OUR PRODUCTS; THE

VALUE OF OUR INVESTMENT IN R&D, PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT, AND

MARKETING COULD BE REDUCED; AND THIRD PARTIES MIGHT ASSERT

AGAINST US OR OUR CUSTOMERS CLAIMS RELATED TO RESULTING LOSSES

OF CONFIDENTIAL OR PROPRIETARY INFORMATION OR END-USER DATA

AND/OR SYSTEM RELIABILITY. OUR BUSINESS COULD BE SUBJECT TO

SIGNIFICANT DISRUPTION, AND WE COULD SUFFER MONETARY AND OTHER

LOSSES, INCLUDING THE COST OF PRODUCT RECALLS AND RETURNS AND

REPUTATIONAL HARM, IN THE EVENT OF SUCH INCIDENTS AND CLAIMS.

OUR

LICENSES WITH OTHER COMPANIES AND OUR PARTICIPATION IN INDUSTRY

INITIATIVES MAY ALLOW OTHER COMPANIES, INCLUDING OUR

COMPETITORS, TO USE OUR PATENT RIGHTS.

COMPANIES IN THE SEMICONDUCTOR

INDUSTRY OFTEN RELY ON THE ABILITY TO LICENSE PATENTS FROM EACH

OTHER IN ORDER TO COMPETE. MANY OF OUR COMPETITORS HAVE BROAD

LICENSES OR CROSS-LICENSES WITH US, AND UNDER CURRENT CASE LAW,

SOME OF THE LICENSES MAY PERMIT THESE COMPETITORS TO PASS OUR

PATENT RIGHTS ON TO OTHERS. IF ONE OF THESE LICENSEES BECOMES A

FOUNDRY, OUR COMPETITORS MIGHT BE ABLE TO AVOID OUR PATENT

RIGHTS IN MANUFACTURING COMPETING PRODUCTS. IN ADDITION, OUR

PARTICIPATION IN INDUSTRY INITIATIVES MAY REQUIRE US TO LICENSE

OUR PATENTS TO OTHER COMPANIES THAT ADOPT CERTAIN INDUSTRY

STANDARDS OR SPECIFICATIONS, EVEN WHEN SUCH ORGANIZATIONS DO NOT

ADOPT STANDARDS OR SPECIFICATIONS PROPOSED BY US. AS A RESULT,

OUR PATENTS IMPLICATED BY OUR PARTICIPATION IN INDUSTRY

INITIATIVES MIGHT NOT BE AVAILABLE FOR US TO ENFORCE AGAINST

OTHERS WHO MIGHT OTHERWISE BE DEEMED TO BE INFRINGING THOSE

PATENTS, OUR COSTS OF ENFORCING OUR LICENSES OR PROTECTING OUR

PATENTS MAY INCREASE, AND THE VALUE OF OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

MAY BE IMPAIRED.

DECISIONS

ABOUT THE SCOPE OF OPERATIONS OF OUR BUSINESS COULD AFFECT OUR

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

CHANGES IN THE BUSINESS

ENVIRONMENT COULD LEAD TO CHANGES IN OUR DECISIONS ABOUT THE

SCOPE OF OPERATIONS OF OUR BUSINESS, AND THESE CHANGES COULD

RESULT IN RESTRUCTURING AND ASSET IMPAIRMENT CHARGES. FACTORS

THAT COULD CAUSE ACTUAL RESULTS TO DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM OUR

EXPECTATIONS WITH REGARD TO CHANGING THE SCOPE OF OUR OPERATIONS

INCLUDE.



TIMING AND EXECUTION OF PLANS AND

PROGRAMS THAT MAY BE SUBJECT TO LOCAL LABOR LAW REQUIREMENTS,

INCLUDING CONSULTATION WITH APPROPRIATE WORK COUNCILS;



CHANGES IN ASSUMPTIONS RELATED TO

SEVERANCE AND POSTRETIREMENT COSTS;



FUTURE DIVESTITURES;



NEW BUSINESS INITIATIVES AND

CHANGES IN PRODUCT ROADMAP, DEVELOPMENT, AND MANUFACTURING;



CHANGES IN EMPLOYMENT LEVELS AND

TURNOVER RATES;



CHANGES IN PRODUCT DEMAND AND THE

BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT; AND



CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF

CERTAIN LONG-LIVED ASSETS.

OUR

ACQUISITIONS, DIVESTITURES, AND OTHER TRANSACTIONS COULD DISRUPT

OUR ONGOING BUSINESS AND HARM OUR RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS.

IN PURSUING OUR BUSINESS STRATEGY,

WE ROUTINELY CONDUCT DISCUSSIONS, EVALUATE OPPORTUNITIES, AND

ENTER INTO AGREEMENTS REGARDING POSSIBLE INVESTMENTS,

ACQUISITIONS, DIVESTITURES, AND OTHER TRANSACTIONS, SUCH AS

JOINT VENTURES. ACQUISITIONS AND OTHER TRANSACTIONS INVOLVE

SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES AND RISKS, INCLUDING RISKS THAT.



WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO IDENTIFY

SUITABLE OPPORTUNITIES AT TERMS ACCEPTABLE TO US;



THE TRANSACTION MAY NOT ADVANCE

OUR BUSINESS STRATEGY;



WE MAY NOT REALIZE A SATISFACTORY

RETURN ON THE INVESTMENT WE MAKE;



WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO RETAIN KEY

PERSONNEL OF THE ACQUIRED BUSINESS; OR



WE MAY EXPERIENCE DIFFICULTY IN

INTEGRATING NEW EMPLOYEES, BUSINESS SYSTEMS, AND TECHNOLOGY.

WHEN WE DECIDE TO SELL ASSETS OR A

BUSINESS, WE MAY ENCOUNTER DIFFICULTY IN FINDING OR COMPLETING

DIVESTITURE OPPORTUNITIES OR ALTERNATIVE EXIT STRATEGIES ON

ACCEPTABLE TERMS IN A TIMELY MANNER, AND THE AGREED TERMS AND

FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS COULD BE RENEGOTIATED DUE TO CHANGES IN

BUSINESS OR MARKET CONDITIONS. THESE CIRCUMSTANCES COULD DELAY

THE ACCOMPLISHMENT OF OUR STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES OR CAUSE US TO

INCUR ADDITIONAL EXPENSES WITH RESPECT TO BUSINESSES THAT WE

WANT TO DISPOSE OF, OR WE MAY DISPOSE OF A BUSINESS AT A PRICE

OR ON TERMS THAT ARE LESS FAVORABLE THAN WE HAD ANTICIPATED,

RESULTING IN A LOSS ON THE TRANSACTION.

19

TABLE OF CONTENTS

IF WE DO ENTER INTO AGREEMENTS

WITH RESPECT TO ACQUISITIONS, DIVESTITURES, OR OTHER

TRANSACTIONS, WE MAY FAIL TO COMPLETE THEM DUE TO.



FAILURE TO OBTAIN REQUIRED

REGULATORY OR OTHER APPROVALS;



INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY OR OTHER

LITIGATION;



DIFFICULTIES THAT WE OR OTHER

PARTIES MAY ENCOUNTER IN OBTAINING FINANCING FOR THE

TRANSACTION; OR



OTHER FACTORS.

FURTHER, ACQUISITIONS,

DIVESTITURES, AND OTHER TRANSACTIONS REQUIRE SUBSTANTIAL

MANAGEMENT RESOURCES AND HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO DIVERT OUR

ATTENTION FROM OUR EXISTING BUSINESS. THESE FACTORS COULD HARM

OUR BUSINESS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

IN

ORDER TO COMPETE, WE MUST ATTRACT, RETAIN, AND MOTIVATE KEY

EMPLOYEES, AND OUR FAILURE TO DO SO COULD HARM OUR RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS.

IN ORDER TO COMPETE, WE MUST

ATTRACT, RETAIN, AND MOTIVATE EXECUTIVES AND OTHER KEY

EMPLOYEES. HIRING AND RETAINING QUALIFIED EXECUTIVES,

SCIENTISTS, ENGINEERS, TECHNICAL STAFF, AND SALES

REPRESENTATIVES ARE CRITICAL TO OUR BUSINESS, AND COMPETITION

FOR EXPERIENCED EMPLOYEES IN THE SEMICONDUCTOR INDUSTRY CAN BE

INTENSE. TO HELP ATTRACT, RETAIN, AND MOTIVATE QUALIFIED

EMPLOYEES, WE USE SHARE-BASED INCENTIVE AWARDS SUCH AS EMPLOYEE

STOCK OPTIONS AND NON-VESTED SHARE UNITS (RESTRICTED STOCK

UNITS). IF THE VALUE OF SUCH STOCK AWARDS DOES NOT APPRECIATE AS

MEASURED BY THE PERFORMANCE OF THE PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK, OR

IF OUR SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION OTHERWISE CEASES TO BE VIEWED AS

A VALUABLE BENEFIT, OUR ABILITY TO ATTRACT, RETAIN, AND MOTIVATE

EMPLOYEES COULD BE WEAKENED, WHICH COULD HARM OUR RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS.

OUR

FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH APPLICABLE ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND

REGULATIONS WORLDWIDE COULD HARM OUR BUSINESS AND RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS.

THE MANUFACTURING AND ASSEMBLING

AND TESTING OF OUR PRODUCTS REQUIRE THE USE OF HAZARDOUS

MATERIALS THAT ARE SUBJECT TO A BROAD ARRAY OF EHS LAWS AND

REGULATIONS. OUR FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH ANY OF THOSE APPLICABLE

LAWS OR REGULATIONS COULD RESULT IN.



REGULATORY PENALTIES, FINES, AND

LEGAL LIABILITIES;



SUSPENSION OF PRODUCTION;



ALTERATION OF OUR FABRICATION AND

ASSEMBLY AND TEST PROCESSES; AND



CURTAILMENT OF OUR OPERATIONS OR

SALES.

IN ADDITION, OUR FAILURE TO MANAGE

THE USE, TRANSPORTATION, EMISSIONS, DISCHARGE, STORAGE,

RECYCLING, OR DISPOSAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS COULD SUBJECT US

TO INCREASED COSTS OR FUTURE LIABILITIES. EXISTING AND FUTURE

ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS COULD ALSO REQUIRE US TO

ACQUIRE POLLUTION ABATEMENT OR REMEDIATION EQUIPMENT, MODIFY OUR

PRODUCT DESIGNS, OR INCUR OTHER EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH SUCH

LAWS AND REGULATIONS. MANY NEW MATERIALS THAT WE ARE EVALUATING

FOR USE IN OUR OPERATIONS MAY BE SUBJECT TO REGULATION UNDER

EXISTING OR FUTURE ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS THAT MAY

RESTRICT OUR USE OF ONE OR MORE OF SUCH MATERIALS IN OUR

MANUFACTURING, ASSEMBLY AND TEST PROCESSES, OR PRODUCTS. ANY OF

THESE RESTRICTIONS COULD HARM OUR BUSINESS AND RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS BY INCREASING OUR EXPENSES OR REQUIRING US TO ALTER

OUR MANUFACTURING AND ASSEMBLY AND TEST PROCESSES.

CLIMATE

CHANGE POSES BOTH REGULATORY AND PHYSICAL RISKS THAT COULD HARM

OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR AFFECT THE WAY WE CONDUCT OUR

BUSINESS.

IN ADDITION TO THE POSSIBLE DIRECT

ECONOMIC IMPACT THAT CLIMATE CHANGE COULD HAVE ON US, CLIMATE

CHANGE MITIGATION PROGRAMS AND REGULATIONS CAN INCREASE OUR

COSTS. FOR EXAMPLE, THE COST OF PERFLUOROCOMPOUNDS (PFCS), A GAS

THAT WE USE IN OUR MANUFACTURING, COULD INCREASE OVER TIME UNDER

SOME CLIMATE-CHANGE-FOCUSED EMISSIONS TRADING PROGRAMS THAT MAY

BE IMPOSED BY GOVERNMENT REGULATION. IF THE USE OF PFCS IS

PROHIBITED, WE WOULD NEED TO OBTAIN SUBSTITUTE MATERIALS THAT

MAY COST MORE OR BE LESS AVAILABLE FOR OUR MANUFACTURING

OPERATIONS. IN ADDITION, AIR QUALITY PERMIT REQUIREMENTS FOR OUR

MANUFACTURING OPERATIONS COULD BECOME MORE BURDENSOME AND CAUSE

DELAYS IN OUR ABILITY TO MODIFY OUR FACILITIES. WE ALSO SEE THE

POTENTIAL FOR HIGHER ENERGY COSTS DRIVEN BY CLIMATE CHANGE

REGULATIONS. OUR COSTS COULD INCREASE IF UTILITY COMPANIES PASS

ON THEIR COSTS, SUCH AS THOSE ASSOCIATED WITH CARBON TAXES,

EMISSION CAP AND TRADE PROGRAMS, OR RENEWABLE PORTFOLIO

STANDARDS. WHILE WE MAINTAIN BUSINESS RECOVERY PLANS THAT ARE

INTENDED TO ALLOW US TO RECOVER FROM NATURAL DISASTERS OR OTHER

EVENTS THAT CAN BE DISRUPTIVE TO OUR BUSINESS, WE CANNOT BE SURE

THAT OUR PLANS WILL FULLY PROTECT US FROM ALL SUCH DISASTERS OR

EVENTS. MANY OF OUR OPERATIONS ARE LOCATED IN SEMI-ARID REGIONS,

SUCH AS ISRAEL AND THE SOUTHWESTERN U.S. SOME SCENARIOS PREDICT

THAT THESE REGIONS MAY BECOME EVEN MORE VULNERABLE TO PROLONGED

DROUGHTS DUE TO CLIMATE CHANGE.

DIGITAL ECONOMY. OUR PRIMARY COMPONENT-LEVEL PRODUCTS INCLUDE

MICROPROCESSORS, CHIPSETS, AND FLASH MEMORY. TO BETTER ALIGN OUR

MAJOR PRODUCT GROUPS AROUND THE CORE COMPETENCIES OF INTEL

ARCHITECTURE AND OUR MANUFACTURING OPERATIONS, WE COMPLETED THE

REORGANIZATION OF OUR BUSINESS IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2009.

DEEPEST RECESSIONS IN OUR HISTORY AND EMERGED FROM IT WITH

BETTER PRODUCTS AND TECHNOLOGY IN A STRENGTHENING MARKET.

COMPARED TO THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2008, REVENUE WAS DOWN 26% IN

THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2009, WITH THE SECOND AND THIRD QUARTERS

DOWN 15% AND 8%, RESPECTIVELY, COMPARED TO THE SECOND AND THIRD

QUARTERS OF 2008. HOWEVER, OUR FOURTH QUARTER RESULTS REFLECTED

A STRENGTHENING DEMAND ACROSS ALL REGIONS AND ALL PRODUCT

CATEGORIES, DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY THE NOTEBOOK MARKET SEGMENT.

FOURTH QUARTER REVENUE OF $10.6 BILLION WAS UP 13% COMPARED TO

THE THIRD QUARTER, NEARLY TWICE THE SEASONAL AVERAGE, AND UP 28%

COMPARED TO THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2008.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

MANAGEMENTS

DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)

THE LAUNCH OF OUR MICROPROCESSOR

PRODUCTS USING 32NM PROCESS TECHNOLOGY WAS STRONG IN THE FOURTH

QUARTER AND WAS ONE OF THE CONTRIBUTORS TO THE INCREASE IN OUR

OVERALL MICROPROCESSOR AVERAGE SELLING PRICES COMPARED TO THE

THIRD QUARTER. OUR SERVER PRODUCTS ALSO HAD A STRONG QUARTER,

AND WE SAW A DEMAND SHIFT TOWARD HIGHER END PRODUCTS, WHICH ALSO

CONTRIBUTED TO THE INCREASE IN OUR AVERAGE SELLING PRICES.

DESPITE THESE FOURTH QUARTER INCREASES, OUR MICROPROCESSOR

AVERAGE SELLING PRICES IN 2009 WERE LOWER THAN IN 2008, DRIVEN

PRIMARILY BY DECREASES IN AVERAGE SELLING PRICES IN THE NOTEBOOK

AND DESKTOP MARKET SEGMENTS.

WITH THE LAUNCH OF OUR 32NM

PRODUCTS AND FOURTH QUARTER RECORD SHIPMENTS OF MICROPROCESSOR

UNITS, WE ARE ENTERING 2010 IN A STRONG COMPETITIVE POSITION AS

WE CONTINUE DELIVERING IMPROVEMENTS IN OUR PRODUCT OFFERINGS

THROUGH THE TICK-TOCK MANUFACTURING PROCESS

TECHNOLOGY AND PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT CADENCE. ADDITIONALLY, OUR

INTEL ATOM PROCESSORS AND RELATED CHIPSETS CONTINUE THEIR STRONG

RAMP, WITH REVENUE HAVING INCREASED NEARLY $900 MILLION IN 2009

COMPARED TO 2008.

WE BELIEVE OUR TOTAL INVENTORY

LEVELS OF $2.9 BILLION, THOUGH UP COMPARED TO THE THIRD QUARTER

OF 2009, ARE APPROPRIATE BASED ON OUR FORECASTS. WE BELIEVE THAT

OEM COMPONENT INVENTORIES ARE ROUGHLY FLAT COMPARED TO THE THIRD

QUARTER AND BELOW LEVELS AT THE END OF 2008. ADDITIONALLY, OUR

DISTRIBUTORS INVENTORIES ARE DOWN COMPARED TO THE THIRD

QUARTER.

OUR FOURTH QUARTER GROSS MARGIN

PERCENTAGE OF 64.7% SET A NEW QUARTERLY RECORD. THE FOURTH

QUARTER GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE COMPARED TO THE THIRD QUARTER

WAS POSITIVELY IMPACTED BY LOWER INVENTORY WRITE-OFFS, HIGHER

MICROPROCESSOR AVERAGE SELLING PRICES AND UNIT SALES, THE LACK

OF EXCESS CAPACITY CHARGES, AND IMPROVING UNIT COSTS. IN THE

FIRST QUARTER OF 2010, WE EXPECT OUR GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE TO

DECREASE DUE TO HIGHER UNIT COSTS AS WE CONTINUE TO RAMP OUR

32NM PRODUCTS, AS WELL AS SEASONALLY LOWER MICROPROCESSOR UNIT

SALES AND LOWER MICROPROCESSOR AVERAGE SELLING PRICES.

IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2009, WE

MADE A $1.25 BILLION PAYMENT TO AMD AS PART OF A SETTLEMENT TO

END ALL OUTSTANDING LITIGATION BETWEEN THE COMPANIES, INCLUDING

ANTITRUST LITIGATION AND CROSS-LICENSE PATENT DISPUTES. ALSO IN

THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2009, THE NEW YORK ATTORNEY GENERAL AND

THE U.S. FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION FILED ANTITRUST SUITS AGAINST

INTEL. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ON OUR LITIGATION MATTERS, SEE

NOTE 28: CONTINGENCIES IN PART II, ITEM 8 OF THIS

FORM

10-K.

FROM A FINANCIAL CONDITION

PERSPECTIVE, WE ENDED 2009 WITH AN INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO OF $13.9

BILLION, CONSISTING OF CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS, DEBT

INSTRUMENTS INCLUDED IN TRADING ASSETS, AND SHORT-TERM

INVESTMENTS. DURING 2009, WE GENERATED $11.2 BILLION IN CASH

FROM OPERATIONS DESPITE PAYING THE 1.06 BILLION ($1.447

BILLION) EUROPEAN COMMISSION FINE RECORDED IN THE SECOND QUARTER

OF 2009, AND THE AMD SETTLEMENT RECORDED IN THE FOURTH QUARTER

OF 2009. DURING 2009, WE ISSUED $2.0 BILLION OF CONVERTIBLE DEBT

AND UTILIZED THE PROCEEDS FROM THE CONVERTIBLE DEBT TO

REPURCHASE $1.7 BILLION OF COMMON STOCK THROUGH OUR COMMON STOCK

REPURCHASE PROGRAM. IN ADDITION, DURING 2009 WE RETURNED $3.1

BILLION TO STOCKHOLDERS THROUGH DIVIDENDS. IN JANUARY 2010, OUR

BOARD OF DIRECTORS DECLARED A DIVIDEND OF $0.1575 PER COMMON

SHARE FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2010, AN INCREASE OF 12.5%

COMPARED TO OUR FOURTH QUARTER DIVIDEND.

IN FEBRUARY 2010, WE SIGNED A

DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT WITH MICRON AND NUMONYX UNDER WHICH MICRON

AGREED TO ACQUIRE NUMONYX IN AN

ALL-STOCK

TRANSACTION. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION, SEE NOTE 11.

OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)

STRATEGY

OUR GOAL IS TO BE THE PREEMINENT

PROVIDER OF SEMICONDUCTOR CHIPS AND PLATFORMS FOR THE WORLDWIDE

DIGITAL ECONOMY. AS PART OF OUR OVERALL STRATEGY TO COMPETE IN

EACH RELEVANT MARKET SEGMENT, WE USE OUR CORE COMPETENCIES IN

THE DESIGN AND MANUFACTURE OF INTEGRATED CIRCUITS, AS WELL AS

OUR FINANCIAL RESOURCES, GLOBAL PRESENCE, BRAND RECOGNITION, AND

SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT. WE BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE THE SCALE,

CAPACITY, AND GLOBAL REACH TO ESTABLISH NEW TECHNOLOGIES AND

RESPOND TO CUSTOMERS NEEDS QUICKLY.

SOME OF OUR KEY FOCUS AREAS ARE

LISTED BELOW.



CUSTOMER

ORIENTATION.

OUR

STRATEGY FOCUSES ON DEVELOPING OUR NEXT GENERATION OF PRODUCTS

BASED ON THE NEEDS AND EXPECTATIONS OF OUR CUSTOMERS. IN TURN,

OUR PRODUCTS HELP ENABLE THE DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT OF NEW FORM

FACTORS AND USAGE MODELS FOR BUSINESSES AND CONSUMERS. WE OFFER

PLATFORMS THAT INCORPORATE VARIOUS COMPONENTS DESIGNED AND

CONFIGURED TO WORK TOGETHER TO PROVIDE AN OPTIMIZED COMPUTING

SOLUTION COMPARED TO COMPONENTS THAT ARE USED SEPARATELY.



ARCHITECTURE AND

PLATFORMS.

WE

ARE FOCUSING ON IMPROVED ENERGY-EFFICIENT PERFORMANCE FOR

COMPUTING AND COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEMS AND DEVICES. IMPROVED

ENERGY-EFFICIENT PERFORMANCE INVOLVES BALANCING IMPROVED

PERFORMANCE WITH LOWER POWER CONSUMPTION. WE CONTINUE TO DEVELOP

MULTI-CORE MICROPROCESSORS WITH AN INCREASING NUMBER OF CORES,

WHICH ENABLE IMPROVED MULTITASKING AND ENERGY EFFICIENCY. IN

ADDITION, TO MEET THE DEMANDS OF NEW AND EVOLVING NETBOOK,

CONSUMER ELECTRONICS, AND VARIOUS EMBEDDED MARKET SEGMENTS, WE

OFFER AND ARE CONTINUING TO DEVELOP SOC PRODUCTS THAT ARE

DESIGNED TO PROVIDE IMPROVED PERFORMANCE DUE TO HIGHER

INTEGRATION, LOWER POWER CONSUMPTION, AND SMALLER FORM FACTORS.



SILICON AND MANUFACTURING

TECHNOLOGY

LEADERSHIP.

OUR

STRATEGY FOR DEVELOPING MICROPROCESSORS WITH IMPROVED

PERFORMANCE IS TO SYNCHRONIZE THE INTRODUCTION OF A NEW

MICROARCHITECTURE WITH IMPROVEMENTS IN SILICON PROCESS

TECHNOLOGY. WE PLAN TO INTRODUCE A NEW MICROARCHITECTURE

APPROXIMATELY EVERY TWO YEARS AND RAMP THE NEXT GENERATION OF

SILICON PROCESS TECHNOLOGY IN THE INTERVENING YEARS. THIS

COORDINATED SCHEDULE ALLOWS US TO DEVELOP AND INTRODUCE NEW

PRODUCTS BASED ON A COMMON MICROARCHITECTURE QUICKLY, WITHOUT

WAITING FOR THE NEXT GENERATION OF SILICON PROCESS TECHNOLOGY.

WE REFER TO THIS AS OUR TICK-TOCK TECHNOLOGY

DEVELOPMENT CADENCE. IN KEEPING WITH THIS CADENCE, WE EXPECT TO

INTRODUCE A NEW MICROARCHITECTURE USING OUR 32NM PROCESS

TECHNOLOGY IN 2010.



STRATEGIC

INVESTMENTS.

WE

MAKE INVESTMENTS IN COMPANIES AROUND THE WORLD THAT WE BELIEVE

WILL GENERATE FINANCIAL RETURNS, FURTHER OUR STRATEGIC

OBJECTIVES, AND SUPPORT OUR KEY BUSINESS INITIATIVES. OUR

INVESTMENTS, INCLUDING THOSE MADE THROUGH OUR INTEL CAPITAL

PROGRAM, GENERALLY FOCUS ON INVESTING IN COMPANIES AND

INITIATIVES TO STIMULATE GROWTH IN THE DIGITAL ECONOMY, CREATE

NEW BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES FOR INTEL, AND EXPAND GLOBAL MARKETS

FOR OUR PRODUCTS. OUR CURRENT INVESTMENTS PRIMARILY FOCUS ON THE

FOLLOWING AREAS: ADVANCING FLASH MEMORY PRODUCTS, ENABLING

MOBILE WIRELESS DEVICES, ADVANCING THE DIGITAL HOME, ENHANCING

THE DIGITAL ENTERPRISE, ADVANCING HIGH-PERFORMANCE

COMMUNICATIONS INFRASTRUCTURES, AND DEVELOPING THE NEXT

GENERATION OF SILICON PROCESS TECHNOLOGIES.



BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT AND

SOFTWARE.

WE

BELIEVE THAT WE ARE WELL POSITIONED IN THE TECHNOLOGY INDUSTRY

TO HELP DRIVE INNOVATION, FOSTER COLLABORATION, AND PROMOTE

INDUSTRY STANDARDS THAT WILL YIELD INNOVATION AND IMPROVED

TECHNOLOGIES FOR USERS. WE PLAN TO CONTINUE TO CULTIVATE NEW

BUSINESSES AND WORK TO ENCOURAGE THE INDUSTRY TO OFFER PRODUCTS

THAT TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE LATEST MARKET TRENDS AND USAGE

MODELS. WE FREQUENTLY PARTICIPATE IN INDUSTRY INITIATIVES

DESIGNED TO DISCUSS AND AGREE UPON TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS AND

OTHER ASPECTS OF TECHNOLOGIES THAT COULD BE ADOPTED AS STANDARDS

BY STANDARDS-SETTING ORGANIZATIONS. THROUGH OUR SOFTWARE AND

SERVICES GROUP, WE HELP ENABLE AND ADVANCE THE COMPUTING

ECOSYSTEM BY PROVIDING DEVELOPMENT TOOLS AND SUPPORT TO HELP

SOFTWARE DEVELOPERS CREATE SOFTWARE APPLICATIONS AND OPERATING

SYSTEMS THAT TAKE ADVANTAGE OF OUR PLATFORMS. LASTLY, WE BELIEVE

THAT THE SOFTWARE EXPERTISE OF OUR WIND RIVER SOFTWARE GROUP IN

THE EMBEDDED AND HANDHELD MARKET SEGMENTS WILL EXPEDITE OUR

GROWTH STRATEGY IN THESE MARKET SEGMENTS.

WE BELIEVE THAT THE PROLIFERATION

OF THE INTERNET, INCLUDING USER DEMAND FOR PREMIUM CONTENT AND

RICH MEDIA, DRIVES THE NEED FOR GREATER PERFORMANCE IN PCS AND

SERVERS. OLDER PCS ARE INCREASINGLY INCAPABLE OF HANDLING THE

TASKS THAT BUSINESSES AND INDIVIDUAL CONSUMERS DEMAND, SUCH AS

STREAMING VIDEO, WEB CONFERENCING, ONLINE GAMING, AND OTHER

MEMORY-INTENSIVE APPLICATIONS. AS THESE TASKS BECOME EVEN MORE

DEMANDING AND REQUIRE MORE COMPUTING POWER, WE BELIEVE THAT

BUSINESSES AND INDIVIDUAL CONSUMERS WILL NEED AND WANT TO BUY

NEW PCS. WE ALSO BELIEVE THAT INCREASED INTERNET TRAFFIC AND THE

INCREASING USE OF CLOUD COMPUTING, IN WHICH A GROUP OF LINKED

SERVERS PROVIDE A VARIETY OF APPLICATIONS AND DATA TO USERS OVER

THE INTERNET, CREATE A NEED FOR GREATER SERVER INFRASTRUCTURE,

INCLUDING SERVER PRODUCTS OPTIMIZED FOR ENERGY-EFFICIENT

PERFORMANCE AND VIRTUALIZATION.

MANAGEMENTS

DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)

WE BELIEVE THAT THE TREND OF

MOBILE MICROPROCESSOR UNIT GROWTH OUTPACING THE GROWTH IN

DESKTOP MICROPROCESSOR UNITS WILL CONTINUE AND THAT THE DEMAND

FOR MOBILE MICROPROCESSORS WILL RESULT IN THE INCREASED

DEVELOPMENT OF PRODUCTS WITH FORM FACTORS AND USES THAT REQUIRE

LOW-POWER

MICROPROCESSORS. WE ALSO BELIEVE THAT THESE PRODUCTS WILL RESULT

IN DEMAND THAT IS INCREMENTAL TO THAT OF MICROPROCESSORS

DESIGNED FOR NOTEBOOK AND DESKTOP COMPUTERS, AS A GROWING NUMBER

OF HOUSEHOLDS HAVE MULTIPLE DEVICES FOR DIFFERENT COMPUTING

FUNCTIONS. OUR SILICON AND MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY LEADERSHIP

ALLOWS US TO DEVELOP LOW-POWER MICROPROCESSORS FOR THESE AND

OTHER NEW USES AND FORM FACTORS. WE BELIEVE THAT INTEL ATOM

PROCESSORS GIVE US THE ABILITY TO EXTEND INTEL ARCHITECTURE AND

DRIVE GROWTH IN NEW MARKET SEGMENTS, INCLUDING A GROWING NUMBER

OF PRODUCTS THAT REQUIRE PROCESSORS SPECIFICALLY DESIGNED FOR

EMBEDDED APPLICATIONS, HANDHELDS, CONSUMER ELECTRONICS DEVICES,

AND NETBOOKS. WE EXPECT THAT OUR INTEL ATOM DEVELOPER PROGRAM

WILL SPUR NEW APPLICATIONS THAT RUN ON PRODUCTS USING INTEL ATOM

PROCESSORS, WHICH WILL EXPEDITE OUR GROWTH STRATEGY IN THESE NEW

MARKET SEGMENTS. THE COMMON ELEMENTS FOR PRODUCTS IN THESE NEW

MARKET SEGMENTS ARE LOW POWER CONSUMPTION AND THE ABILITY TO

ACCESS THE INTERNET.

WE ARE ALSO FOCUSING ON THE

DEVELOPMENT OF A NEW HIGHLY SCALABLE, MANY-CORE ARCHITECTURE

AIMED AT PARALLEL PROCESSING, THE SIMULTANEOUS USE OF MULTIPLE

CORES TO EXECUTE A COMPUTING TASK. THIS ARCHITECTURE WILL

INITIALLY BE USED AS A SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT PLATFORM FOR

GRAPHICS AND THROUGHPUT COMPUTING (THE NEED FOR LARGE AMOUNTS OF

COMPUTING PERFORMANCE CONSISTENTLY OVER A LONG PERIOD OF TIME).

OVER TIME, THIS ARCHITECTURE MAY BE UTILIZED IN THE DEVELOPMENT

OF PRODUCTS FOR SCIENTIFIC AND PROFESSIONAL WORKSTATIONS AS WELL

AS HIGH-PERFORMANCE COMPUTING APPLICATIONS.

IN ADDITION, WE OFFER, AND ARE

CONTINUING TO DEVELOP, ADVANCED NAND FLASH MEMORY PRODUCTS,

FOCUSING ON SYSTEM-LEVEL SOLUTIONS FOR INTEL ARCHITECTURE

PLATFORMS SUCH AS SOLID-STATE DRIVES. IN SUPPORT OF OUR STRATEGY

TO PROVIDE ADVANCED FLASH MEMORY PRODUCTS, WE CONTINUE TO FOCUS

ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF INNOVATIVE PRODUCTS DESIGNED TO ADDRESS

THE NEEDS OF CUSTOMERS FOR RELIABLE, NON-VOLATILE, LOW-COST,

HIGH-DENSITY

MEMORY.

STRATEGY

BY MAJOR MARKET SEGMENT

THE STRATEGY FOR OUR

PC

CLIENT GROUP

OPERATING SEGMENT IS TO OFFER PRODUCTS THAT

ARE INCORPORATED INTO NOTEBOOK, NETBOOK, AND DESKTOP COMPUTERS

FOR CONSUMERS AND BUSINESSES. OUR STRATEGY FOR THE NOTEBOOK

COMPUTING MARKET SEGMENT IS TO OFFER NOTEBOOK PC PRODUCTS

DESIGNED TO IMPROVE PERFORMANCE, BATTERY LIFE, AND WIRELESS

CONNECTIVITY, AS WELL AS TO ALLOW FOR THE DESIGN OF SMALLER,

LIGHTER, AND THINNER FORM FACTORS. WE ARE ALSO INCREASING OUR

FOCUS ON NOTEBOOK PRODUCTS DESIGNED TO OFFER TECHNOLOGIES THAT

PROVIDE INCREASED MANAGEABILITY AND SECURITY, AND WE CONTINUE TO

INVEST IN THE BUILD-OUT OF WIMAX. OUR STRATEGY FOR THE NETBOOK

COMPUTING MARKET SEGMENT IS TO OFFER PRODUCTS THAT ENABLE

AFFORDABLE, INTERNET-FOCUSED DEVICES WITH SMALL FORM FACTORS.

OUR STRATEGY FOR THE DESKTOP COMPUTING MARKET SEGMENT IS TO

OFFER PRODUCTS THAT PROVIDE INCREASED MANAGEABILITY, SECURITY,

AND ENERGY-EFFICIENT PERFORMANCE WHILE LOWERING TOTAL COST OF

OWNERSHIP FOR BUSINESSES. FOR CONSUMERS IN THE DESKTOP COMPUTING

MARKET SEGMENT, WE ALSO FOCUS ON THE DESIGN OF COMPONENTS FOR

HIGH-END ENTHUSIAST PCS AND MAINSTREAM PCS WITH RICH AUDIO AND

VIDEO CAPABILITIES.

THE STRATEGY FOR OUR

DATA

CENTER GROUP

OPERATING SEGMENT IS TO OFFER PRODUCTS THAT

PROVIDE LEADING PERFORMANCE, ENERGY-EFFICIENCY, AND

VIRTUALIZATION TECHNOLOGY FOR SERVER, WORKSTATION, AND STORAGE

PLATFORMS. WE ARE ALSO INCREASING OUR FOCUS ON PRODUCTS DESIGNED

CRITICAL

ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

THE METHODS, ESTIMATES, AND

JUDGMENTS THAT WE USE IN APPLYING OUR ACCOUNTING POLICIES HAVE A

SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE RESULTS THAT WE REPORT IN OUR

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. SOME OF OUR ACCOUNTING

POLICIES REQUIRE US TO MAKE DIFFICULT AND SUBJECTIVE JUDGMENTS,

OFTEN AS A RESULT OF THE NEED TO MAKE ESTIMATES REGARDING

MATTERS THAT ARE INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN. OUR MOST CRITICAL

ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES INCLUDE.



THE VALUATION OF NON-MARKETABLE

EQUITY INVESTMENTS AND THE DETERMINATION OF

OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY

IMPAIRMENTS, WHICH IMPACT GAINS (LOSSES) ON EQUITY METHOD

INVESTMENTS, NET, OR GAINS (LOSSES) ON OTHER EQUITY INVESTMENTS,

NET WHEN WE RECORD IMPAIRMENTS;



THE ASSESSMENT OF RECOVERABILITY

OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS, WHICH PRIMARILY IMPACTS GROSS MARGIN OR

OPERATING EXPENSES WHEN WE RECORD ASSET IMPAIRMENTS OR

ACCELERATE THEIR DEPRECIATION;



THE RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT OF

CURRENT AND DEFERRED INCOME TAXES (INCLUDING THE MEASUREMENT OF

UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS), WHICH IMPACT OUR PROVISION FOR TAXES;

AND



THE VALUATION OF INVENTORY, WHICH

IMPACTS GROSS MARGIN.

BELOW, WE DISCUSS THESE POLICIES

FURTHER, AS WELL AS THE ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS INVOLVED.

NON-MARKETABLE

EQUITY INVESTMENTS

WE REGULARLY INVEST IN

NON-MARKETABLE EQUITY INSTRUMENTS OF PRIVATE COMPANIES, WHICH

RANGE FROM EARLY-STAGE COMPANIES THAT ARE OFTEN STILL DEFINING

THEIR STRATEGIC DIRECTION TO MORE MATURE COMPANIES WITH

ESTABLISHED REVENUE STREAMS AND BUSINESS MODELS. THE CARRYING

VALUE OF OUR NON-MARKETABLE EQUITY INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO,

EXCLUDING EQUITY DERIVATIVES, TOTALED $3.4 BILLION AS OF

DECEMBER 26, 2009 ($4.1 BILLION AS OF DECEMBER 27, 2008). THE

MAJORITY OF THIS BALANCE AS OF DECEMBER 26, 2009 WAS

CONCENTRATED IN COMPANIES IN THE FLASH MEMORY MARKET SEGMENT.

OUR FLASH MEMORY MARKET SEGMENT INVESTMENTS INCLUDE OUR

INVESTMENT IN IMFT AND IM FLASH SINGAPORE, LLP (IMFS) OF $1.6

BILLION ($2.1 BILLION AS OF DECEMBER 27, 2008). FOR FURTHER

INFORMATION, SEE NOTE 11: NON-MARKETABLE EQUITY

INVESTMENTS IN PART II, ITEM 8 OF THIS FORM

10-K.

OUR NON-MARKETABLE EQUITY

INVESTMENTS ARE RECORDED USING ADJUSTED COST BASIS OR THE EQUITY

METHOD OF ACCOUNTING, DEPENDING ON THE FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES

OF EACH INVESTMENT (SEE NOTE 2: ACCOUNTING POLICIES

IN PART II, ITEM 8 OF THIS FORM

10-K).

OUR

NON-MARKETABLE EQUITY INVESTMENTS ARE CLASSIFIED IN OTHER

LONG-TERM ASSETS ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS.

NON-MARKETABLE EQUITY INVESTMENTS

ARE INHERENTLY RISKY, AND A NUMBER OF THE COMPANIES IN WHICH WE

INVEST COULD FAIL. THEIR SUCCESS IS DEPENDENT ON PRODUCT

DEVELOPMENT, MARKET ACCEPTANCE, OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCY, AND

OTHER KEY BUSINESS FACTORS. DEPENDING ON THEIR FUTURE PROSPECTS,

THE COMPANIES MAY NOT BE ABLE TO RAISE ADDITIONAL FUNDS WHEN THE

FUNDS ARE NEEDED OR THEY MAY RECEIVE LOWER VALUATIONS, WITH LESS

FAVORABLE INVESTMENT TERMS THAN IN PREVIOUS FINANCINGS, AND OUR

INVESTMENTS WOULD LIKELY BECOME IMPAIRED. ADDITIONALLY,

FINANCIAL MARKETS AND CREDIT MARKETS ARE VOLATILE, WHICH COULD

NEGATIVELY AFFECT THE PROSPECTS OF THE COMPANIES WE INVEST IN,

THEIR ABILITY TO RAISE ADDITIONAL CAPITAL, AND THE LIKELIHOOD OF

OUR BEING ABLE TO REALIZE VALUE IN OUR INVESTMENTS THROUGH

LIQUIDITY EVENTS SUCH AS INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERINGS, MERGERS, AND

PRIVATE SALES. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT OUR INVESTMENT

PORTFOLIO RISKS, SEE RISK FACTORS IN PART I, ITEM 1A

OF THIS FORM

10-K.

WE DETERMINE THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR

NON-MARKETABLE EQUITY INVESTMENTS QUARTERLY FOR DISCLOSURE

PURPOSES; HOWEVER, THE INVESTMENTS ARE RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE

ONLY WHEN AN IMPAIRMENT CHARGE IS RECOGNIZED. WE DETERMINE THE

FAIR VALUE OF OUR NON-MARKETABLE EQUITY INVESTMENTS USING THE

MARKET AND INCOME APPROACHES. THE MARKET APPROACH INCLUDES THE

USE OF FINANCIAL METRICS AND RATIOS OF COMPARABLE PUBLIC

COMPANIES, SUCH AS PROJECTED REVENUES, EARNINGS, AND COMPARABLE

PERFORMANCE MULTIPLES. THE SELECTION OF COMPARABLE COMPANIES

REQUIRES MANAGEMENT JUDGMENT AND IS BASED ON A NUMBER OF

FACTORS, INCLUDING COMPARABLE COMPANIES SIZES, GROWTH

RATES, INDUSTRIES, DEVELOPMENT STAGES, AND OTHER RELEVANT

FACTORS. THE INCOME APPROACH INCLUDES THE USE OF A DISCOUNTED

CASH FLOW MODEL, WHICH MAY INCLUDE ONE OR MULTIPLE DISCOUNTED

CASH FLOW SCENARIOS AND REQUIRES THE FOLLOWING SIGNIFICANT

ESTIMATES FOR THE INVESTEE: REVENUE, BASED ON ASSUMED MARKET

SEGMENT SIZE AND ASSUMED MARKET SEGMENT SHARE; EXPENSES, CAPITAL

SPENDING, AND OTHER COSTS; AND DISCOUNT RATES BASED ON THE RISK

PROFILE OF COMPARABLE COMPANIES. ESTIMATES OF MARKET SEGMENT

SIZE, MARKET SEGMENT SHARE, EXPENSES, CAPITAL SPENDING, AND

OTHER COSTS ARE DEVELOPED BY THE INVESTEE

AND/OR

INTEL

USING HISTORICAL DATA AND AVAILABLE MARKET DATA. THE VALUATION

OF OUR NON-MARKETABLE INVESTMENTS ALSO TAKES INTO ACCOUNT

VARIABLES SUCH AS CONDITIONS REFLECTED IN THE CAPITAL MARKETS,

RECENT FINANCING ACTIVITIES BY THE INVESTEES, THE

INVESTEES CAPITAL STRUCTURE, AND DIFFERENCES IN SENIORITY

AND RIGHTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE INVESTEES CAPITAL.

29

TABLE OF CONTENTS

MANAGEMENTS

DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)

FOR NON-MARKETABLE EQUITY

INVESTMENTS, THE MEASUREMENT OF FAIR VALUE REQUIRES SIGNIFICANT

JUDGMENT AND INCLUDES QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE ANALYSIS OF

IDENTIFIED EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES THAT IMPACT THE FAIR VALUE OF

THE INVESTMENT, SUCH AS.



THE INVESTEES REVENUE AND

EARNINGS TRENDS RELATIVE TO PRE-DEFINED MILESTONES AND OVERALL

BUSINESS PROSPECTS;



THE TECHNOLOGICAL FEASIBILITY OF

THE INVESTEES PRODUCTS AND TECHNOLOGIES;



THE GENERAL MARKET CONDITIONS IN

THE INVESTEES INDUSTRY OR GEOGRAPHIC AREA, INCLUDING

ADVERSE REGULATORY OR ECONOMIC CHANGES;



FACTORS RELATED TO THE

INVESTEES ABILITY TO REMAIN IN BUSINESS, SUCH AS THE

INVESTEES LIQUIDITY, DEBT RATIOS, AND THE RATE AT WHICH

THE INVESTEE IS USING ITS CASH; AND



THE INVESTEES RECEIPT OF

ADDITIONAL FUNDING AT A LOWER VALUATION.

IF THE FAIR VALUE OF AN INVESTMENT

IS BELOW OUR CARRYING VALUE, WE DETERMINE IF THE INVESTMENT IS

OTHER THAN TEMPORARILY IMPAIRED BASED ON OUR QUANTITATIVE AND

QUALITATIVE ANALYSIS, WHICH INCLUDES ASSESSING THE SEVERITY AND

DURATION OF THE IMPAIRMENT AND THE LIKELIHOOD OF RECOVERY BEFORE

DISPOSAL. IF THE INVESTMENT IS CONSIDERED TO BE OTHER THAN

TEMPORARILY IMPAIRED, WE WRITE DOWN THE INVESTMENT TO ITS FAIR

VALUE. IMPAIRMENTS OF NON-MARKETABLE EQUITY INVESTMENTS WERE

$221 MILLION IN 2009. OVER THE PAST 12 QUARTERS, INCLUDING THE

FOURTH QUARTER OF 2009, IMPAIRMENTS OF NON-MARKETABLE EQUITY

INVESTMENTS RANGED FROM $11 MILLION TO $896 MILLION PER QUARTER.

THIS RANGE INCLUDED IMPAIRMENTS OF $896 MILLION DURING THE

FOURTH QUARTER OF 2008, PRIMARILY RELATED TO A $762 MILLION

IMPAIRMENT CHARGE ON OUR INVESTMENT IN CLEARWIRE COMMUNICATIONS,

LLC (CLEARWIRE LLC).

IMFT/IMFS

IMFT AND IMFS ARE VARIABLE

INTEREST ENTITIES THAT ARE DESIGNED TO MANUFACTURE AND SELL NAND

PRODUCTS TO INTEL AND MICRON AT MANUFACTURING COST. WE DETERMINE

THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR INVESTMENT IN IMFT/IMFS USING THE INCOME

APPROACH BASED ON A WEIGHTED AVERAGE OF MULTIPLE DISCOUNTED CASH

FLOW SCENARIOS OF OUR NAND SOLUTIONS GROUP BUSINESS, WHICH

REQUIRES THE USE OF UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS. UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS

THAT REQUIRE US TO MAKE OUR MOST DIFFICULT AND SUBJECTIVE

JUDGMENTS ARE THE ESTIMATES FOR PROJECTED REVENUE AND DISCOUNT

RATE. CHANGES IN MANAGEMENT ESTIMATES FOR THESE UNOBSERVABLE

INPUTS HAVE THE MOST SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON THE FAIR VALUE

DETERMINATION. WE DID NOT HAVE AN

OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY

IMPAIRMENT ON OUR INVESTMENT IN IMFT/IMFS IN 2009, 2008, OR

2007. IT IS REASONABLY POSSIBLE THAT THE ESTIMATES USED IN THE

FAIR VALUE DETERMINATION COULD CHANGE IN THE NEAR TERM, WHICH

COULD RESULT IN AN IMPAIRMENT OF OUR INVESTMENT.

LONG-LIVED

ASSETS

WE ASSESS THE IMPAIRMENT OF

LONG-LIVED ASSETS WHEN EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES

INDICATE THAT THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE ASSETS OR THE ASSET

GROUPING MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE. FACTORS THAT WE CONSIDER IN

DECIDING WHEN TO PERFORM AN IMPAIRMENT REVIEW INCLUDE

SIGNIFICANT UNDER-PERFORMANCE OF A BUSINESS OR PRODUCT LINE IN

RELATION TO EXPECTATIONS, SIGNIFICANT NEGATIVE INDUSTRY OR

ECONOMIC TRENDS, AND SIGNIFICANT CHANGES OR PLANNED CHANGES IN

OUR USE OF THE ASSETS. WE MEASURE THE RECOVERABILITY OF ASSETS

THAT WILL CONTINUE TO BE USED IN OUR OPERATIONS BY COMPARING THE

CARRYING VALUE OF THE ASSET GROUPING TO OUR ESTIMATE OF THE

RELATED TOTAL FUTURE UNDISCOUNTED NET CASH FLOWS. IF AN ASSET

GROUPINGS CARRYING VALUE IS NOT RECOVERABLE THROUGH THE

RELATED UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS, THE ASSET GROUPING IS

CONSIDERED TO BE IMPAIRED. THE IMPAIRMENT IS MEASURED BY

COMPARING THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE ASSET GROUPINGS

CARRYING VALUE AND ITS FAIR VALUE. FAIR VALUE IS THE PRICE THAT

WOULD BE RECEIVED FROM SELLING AN ASSET IN AN ORDERLY

TRANSACTION BETWEEN MARKET PARTICIPANTS AT THE MEASUREMENT DATE.

LONG-LIVED

ASSETS SUCH AS GOODWILL; INTANGIBLE ASSETS; AND PROPERTY, PLANT

AND EQUIPMENT ARE CONSIDERED NON-FINANCIAL ASSETS, AND ARE

RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE ONLY WHEN AN IMPAIRMENT CHARGE IS

RECOGNIZED.

IMPAIRMENTS OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS

ARE DETERMINED FOR GROUPS OF ASSETS RELATED TO THE LOWEST LEVEL

OF IDENTIFIABLE INDEPENDENT CASH FLOWS. DUE TO OUR ASSET USAGE

MODEL AND THE INTERCHANGEABLE NATURE OF OUR SEMICONDUCTOR

MANUFACTURING CAPACITY, WE MUST MAKE SUBJECTIVE JUDGMENTS IN

DETERMINING THE INDEPENDENT CASH FLOWS THAT CAN BE RELATED TO

SPECIFIC ASSET GROUPINGS. IN ADDITION, AS WE MAKE MANUFACTURING

PROCESS CONVERSIONS AND OTHER FACTORY PLANNING DECISIONS, WE

MUST MAKE SUBJECTIVE JUDGMENTS REGARDING THE REMAINING USEFUL

LIVES OF ASSETS, PRIMARILY PROCESS-SPECIFIC SEMICONDUCTOR

MANUFACTURING TOOLS AND BUILDING IMPROVEMENTS. WHEN WE DETERMINE

THAT THE USEFUL LIVES OF ASSETS ARE SHORTER THAN WE HAD

ORIGINALLY ESTIMATED, WE ACCELERATE THE RATE OF DEPRECIATION

OVER THE ASSETS NEW, SHORTER USEFUL LIVES. OVER THE PAST

12 QUARTERS, INCLUDING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2009, IMPAIRMENTS

AND ACCELERATED DEPRECIATION OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS RANGED FROM

$40 MILLION TO $300 MILLION PER QUARTER. FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION

ON THESE ASSET IMPAIRMENT CHARGES, SEE NOTE 19.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

MANAGEMENTS

DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)

INCOME

TAXES

WE MUST MAKE ESTIMATES AND

JUDGMENTS IN DETERMINING INCOME TAX EXPENSE FOR FINANCIAL

STATEMENT PURPOSES. THESE ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS OCCUR IN THE

CALCULATION OF TAX CREDITS, BENEFITS, AND DEDUCTIONS, AND IN THE

CALCULATION OF CERTAIN TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES THAT ARISE

FROM DIFFERENCES IN THE TIMING OF RECOGNITION OF REVENUE AND

EXPENSE FOR TAX AND FINANCIAL STATEMENT PURPOSES, AS WELL AS THE

INTEREST AND PENALTIES RELATED TO UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS.

SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN THESE ESTIMATES MAY RESULT IN AN INCREASE

OR DECREASE TO OUR TAX PROVISION IN A SUBSEQUENT PERIOD.

WE MUST ASSESS THE LIKELIHOOD THAT

WE WILL BE ABLE TO RECOVER OUR DEFERRED TAX ASSETS. IF RECOVERY

IS NOT LIKELY, WE MUST INCREASE OUR PROVISION FOR TAXES BY

RECORDING A VALUATION ALLOWANCE AGAINST THE DEFERRED TAX ASSETS

THAT WE ESTIMATE WILL NOT ULTIMATELY BE RECOVERABLE. WE BELIEVE

THAT WE WILL ULTIMATELY RECOVER A MAJORITY OF THE DEFERRED TAX

ASSETS RECORDED ON OUR CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS. HOWEVER,

SHOULD THERE BE A CHANGE IN OUR ABILITY TO RECOVER OUR DEFERRED

TAX ASSETS, OUR TAX PROVISION WOULD INCREASE IN THE PERIOD IN

WHICH WE DETERMINED THAT THE RECOVERY WAS NOT LIKELY. RECOVERY

OF A PORTION OF OUR DEFERRED TAX ASSETS IS IMPACTED BY

MANAGEMENTS PLANS WITH RESPECT TO HOLDING OR DISPOSING OF

CERTAIN INVESTMENTS; THEREFORE, CHANGES IN MANAGEMENTS

PLANS WITH RESPECT TO HOLDING OR DISPOSING OF INVESTMENTS COULD

AFFECT OUR FUTURE PROVISION FOR TAXES.

THE CALCULATION OF OUR TAX

LIABILITIES INVOLVES DEALING WITH UNCERTAINTIES IN THE

APPLICATION OF COMPLEX TAX REGULATIONS. WE RECOGNIZE LIABILITIES

FOR UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS BASED ON A TWO-STEP PROCESS. THE

FIRST STEP IS TO EVALUATE THE TAX POSITION FOR RECOGNITION BY

DETERMINING IF THE WEIGHT OF AVAILABLE EVIDENCE INDICATES THAT

IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT THE POSITION WILL BE SUSTAINED

ON AUDIT, INCLUDING RESOLUTION OF RELATED APPEALS OR LITIGATION

PROCESSES, IF ANY. IF WE DETERMINE THAT A TAX POSITION WILL MORE

LIKELY THAN NOT BE SUSTAINED ON AUDIT, THE SECOND STEP REQUIRES

US TO ESTIMATE AND MEASURE THE TAX BENEFIT AS THE LARGEST AMOUNT

THAT IS MORE THAN 50% LIKELY TO BE REALIZED UPON ULTIMATE

SETTLEMENT. IT IS INHERENTLY DIFFICULT AND SUBJECTIVE TO

ESTIMATE SUCH AMOUNTS, AS WE HAVE TO DETERMINE THE PROBABILITY

OF VARIOUS POSSIBLE OUTCOMES. WE

RE-EVALUATE

THESE UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS ON A QUARTERLY BASIS. THIS

EVALUATION IS BASED ON FACTORS SUCH AS CHANGES IN FACTS OR

CIRCUMSTANCES, CHANGES IN TAX LAW, NEW AUDIT ACTIVITY, AND

EFFECTIVELY SETTLED ISSUES. DETERMINING WHETHER AN UNCERTAIN TAX

POSITION IS EFFECTIVELY SETTLED REQUIRES JUDGMENT. SUCH A CHANGE

IN RECOGNITION OR MEASUREMENT WOULD RESULT IN THE RECOGNITION OF

A TAX BENEFIT OR AN ADDITIONAL CHARGE TO THE TAX PROVISION.

INVENTORY

THE VALUATION OF INVENTORY

REQUIRES US TO ESTIMATE OBSOLETE OR EXCESS INVENTORY AS WELL AS

INVENTORY THAT IS NOT OF SALEABLE QUALITY. THE DETERMINATION OF

OBSOLETE OR EXCESS INVENTORY REQUIRES US TO ESTIMATE THE FUTURE

DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS. THE ESTIMATE OF FUTURE DEMAND IS

COMPARED TO

WORK-IN-PROCESS

AND FINISHED GOODS INVENTORY LEVELS TO DETERMINE THE AMOUNT, IF

ANY, OF OBSOLETE OR EXCESS INVENTORY. AS OF DECEMBER 26, 2009,

WE HAD TOTAL

WORK-IN-PROCESS

INVENTORY OF $1,469 MILLION AND TOTAL FINISHED GOODS INVENTORY

OF $1,029 MILLION. THE DEMAND FORECAST IS INCLUDED IN THE

DEVELOPMENT OF OUR SHORT-TERM MANUFACTURING PLANS TO ENABLE

CONSISTENCY BETWEEN INVENTORY VALUATION AND BUILD DECISIONS.

PRODUCT-SPECIFIC FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES REVIEWED IN THE

INVENTORY VALUATION PROCESS INCLUDE A REVIEW OF THE CUSTOMER

BASE, THE STAGE OF THE PRODUCT LIFE CYCLE OF OUR PRODUCTS,

CONSUMER CONFIDENCE, AND CUSTOMER ACCEPTANCE OF OUR PRODUCTS, AS

WELL AS AN ASSESSMENT OF THE SELLING PRICE IN RELATION TO THE

PRODUCT COST. IF OUR DEMAND FORECAST FOR SPECIFIC PRODUCTS IS

GREATER THAN ACTUAL DEMAND AND WE FAIL TO REDUCE MANUFACTURING

OUTPUT ACCORDINGLY, WE COULD BE REQUIRED TO WRITE OFF INVENTORY,

WHICH WOULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR GROSS MARGIN.

IN ORDER TO DETERMINE WHAT COSTS

CAN BE INCLUDED IN THE VALUATION OF INVENTORY, WE MUST DETERMINE

NORMAL CAPACITY AT OUR MANUFACTURING AND ASSEMBLY AND TEST

FACILITIES, BASED ON HISTORICAL LOADINGS OF WAFERS COMPARED TO

TOTAL AVAILABLE CAPACITY. IF THE FACTORY LOADINGS ARE BELOW THE

ESTABLISHED NORMAL CAPACITY LEVEL, A PORTION OF OUR

MANUFACTURING OVERHEAD COSTS WOULD NOT BE INCLUDED IN THE COST

OF INVENTORY, AND THEREFORE WOULD BE RECOGNIZED AS COST OF SALES

IN THAT PERIOD, WHICH WOULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR GROSS MARGIN.

WE REFER TO THESE COSTS AS EXCESS CAPACITY CHARGES. OVER THE

PAST 12 QUARTERS, EXCESS CAPACITY CHARGES RANGED FROM ZERO TO

$680 MILLION PER QUARTER.

BREAKDOWN OF REVENUE

OUR NET REVENUE FOR 2009 DECREASED

7% COMPARED TO 2008. AVERAGE SELLING PRICES FOR MICROPROCESSORS

AND CHIPSETS DECREASED AND MICROPROCESSOR AND CHIPSET UNIT SALES

INCREASED, COMPARED TO 2008, PRIMARILY DUE TO THE RAMP OF INTEL

ATOM PROCESSORS AND CHIPSETS, WHICH GENERALLY HAVE LOWER AVERAGE

SELLING PRICES THAN OUR OTHER MICROPROCESSOR AND CHIPSET

PRODUCTS. REVENUE FROM THE SALE OF NOR FLASH MEMORY PRODUCTS AND

COMMUNICATIONS PRODUCTS DECLINED $740 MILLION, PRIMARILY AS A

RESULT OF BUSINESS DIVESTITURES. ADDITIONALLY, AN INCREASE IN

REVENUE FROM THE SALE OF NAND FLASH MEMORY PRODUCTS WAS MOSTLY

OFFSET BY A DECREASE IN REVENUE FROM THE SALE OF WIRELESS

CONNECTIVITY PRODUCTS.

REVENUE IN THE ASIA-PACIFIC REGION

INCREASED 2% COMPARED TO 2008, WHILE REVENUE IN THE EUROPE,

JAPAN, AND AMERICAS REGIONS DECREASED BY 26%, 15%, AND 4%,

RESPECTIVELY, COMPARED TO 2008.

OUR OVERALL GROSS MARGIN DOLLARS

FOR 2009 DECREASED $1.3 BILLION, OR 6%, COMPARED TO 2008. OUR

OVERALL GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE INCREASED SLIGHTLY TO 55.7% IN

2009 FROM 55.5% IN 2008. THE SLIGHT INCREASE IN GROSS MARGIN

PERCENTAGE WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE GROSS MARGIN

PERCENTAGE INCREASES IN THE NAND SOLUTIONS GROUP AND DATA CENTER

GROUP OPERATING SEGMENTS OFFSET BY THE GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE

DECREASE IN THE PC CLIENT GROUP OPERATING SEGMENT. WE DERIVED A

SUBSTANTIAL MAJORITY OF OUR OVERALL GROSS MARGIN DOLLARS IN

2009, AND MOST OF OUR OVERALL GROSS MARGIN DOLLARS IN 2008, FROM

THE SALES OF MICROPROCESSORS IN THE PC CLIENT GROUP AND DATA

CENTER GROUP OPERATING SEGMENTS. SEE BUSINESS

OUTLOOK FOR A DISCUSSION OF GROSS MARGIN EXPECTATIONS.

OUR NET REVENUE FOR 2008 DECREASED

2% COMPARED TO 2007. HIGHER REVENUE FROM THE SALE OF

MICROPROCESSORS AND CHIPSETS WAS MORE THAN OFFSET BY THE IMPACTS

OF DIVESTITURES AND LOWER REVENUE FROM THE SALE OF MOTHERBOARDS.

REVENUE FROM THE SALE OF NOR FLASH MEMORY AND CELLULAR BASEBAND

PRODUCTS DECLINED $1.7 BILLION, PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF

DIVESTITURE OF THESE BUSINESSES. REVENUE IN THE AMERICAS REGION

DECREASED 4% IN 2008 COMPARED TO 2007. REVENUE IN THE

ASIA-PACIFIC, EUROPE, AND JAPAN REGIONS REMAINED APPROXIMATELY

FLAT IN 2008 COMPARED TO 2007.

OUR OVERALL GROSS MARGIN DOLLARS

FOR 2008 WERE $20.8 BILLION, AN INCREASE OF $940 MILLION, OR 5%,

COMPARED TO 2007. OUR OVERALL GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE INCREASED

TO 55.5% IN 2008 FROM 51.9% IN 2007. THE INCREASE IN GROSS

MARGIN PERCENTAGE WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE GROSS MARGIN

PERCENTAGE INCREASE IN THE PC CLIENT GROUP OPERATING SEGMENT

AND, TO A LESSER EXTENT, THE GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE INCREASE IN

THE DATA CENTER GROUP OPERATING SEGMENT. IN ADDITION, OUR GROSS

MARGIN PERCENTAGE INCREASED DUE TO THE DIVESTITURE OF OUR NOR

FLASH MEMORY BUSINESS. WE DERIVED MOST OF OUR OVERALL GROSS

MARGIN DOLLARS IN 2008 AND 2007 FROM THE SALE OF MICROPROCESSORS

IN THE PC CLIENT GROUP AND DATA CENTER GROUP OPERATING SEGMENTS.

2008. MICROPROCESSORS AND CHIPSETS WITHIN PCCG INCLUDE THOSE

DESIGNED FOR THE NOTEBOOK, NETBOOK, AND DESKTOP COMPUTING MARKET

SEGMENTS. THE DECREASE IN MICROPROCESSOR REVENUE WAS PRIMARILY

DUE TO LOWER NOTEBOOK MICROPROCESSOR AVERAGE SELLING PRICES, AND

LOWER DESKTOP MICROPROCESSOR UNIT SALES AND AVERAGE SELLING

PRICES. THESE DECREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A SIGNIFICANT

INCREASE IN NETBOOK MICROPROCESSOR UNIT SALES DUE TO THE RAMP OF

INTEL ATOM PROCESSORS. THE DECREASE IN CHIPSET, MOTHERBOARD, AND

OTHER REVENUE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER CHIPSET AVERAGE SELLING

PRICES AND LOWER UNIT SALES OF WIRELESS CONNECTIVITY PRODUCTS,

PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER CHIPSET UNIT SALES.

OPERATING INCOME DECREASED BY $1.8

BILLION, OR 19%, IN 2009 COMPARED TO 2008. THE DECREASE WAS

PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER REVENUE AND APPROXIMATELY $810 MILLION OF

HIGHER FACTORY UNDERUTILIZATION CHARGES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY

LOWER CHIPSET AND MICROPROCESSOR UNIT COSTS.

FOR 2008, NET REVENUE FOR THE PCCG

OPERATING SEGMENT INCREASED SLIGHTLY BY $836 MILLION, OR 3%,

COMPARED TO 2007. THE INCREASE IN MICROPROCESSOR REVENUE WAS

PRIMARILY DUE TO SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER NOTEBOOK MICROPROCESSOR

UNIT SALES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER NOTEBOOK

MICROPROCESSOR AVERAGE SELLING PRICES. IN ADDITION, LOWER

DESKTOP MICROPROCESSOR UNIT SALES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE

RAMP OF INTEL ATOM PROCESSORS. THE INCREASE IN CHIPSET,

MOTHERBOARD, AND OTHER REVENUE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER

CHIPSET UNIT SALES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER DESKTOP

MOTHERBOARD UNIT SALES.

OPERATING INCOME INCREASED BY $884

MILLION, OR 10%, IN 2008 COMPARED TO 2007. THE INCREASE IN

OPERATING INCOME WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER MICROPROCESSOR AND

CHIPSET UNIT COSTS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER DESKTOP

MICROPROCESSOR AND CHIPSET REVENUE AND HIGHER OPERATING

EXPENSES. IN ADDITION, APPROXIMATELY $230 MILLION OF LOWER

START-UP

COSTS WERE OFFSET BY SALES IN 2007 OF DESKTOP MICROPROCESSORS

THAT HAD PREVIOUSLY BEEN WRITTEN OFF, AND HIGHER WRITE-OFFS OF

DESKTOP MICROPROCESSOR INVENTORY IN 2008.

COLORADO. AS A RESULT OF PLACING THE FACILITY FOR SALE, IN 2006

WE RECORDED A $214 MILLION IMPAIRMENT CHARGE TO WRITE DOWN TO

FAIR VALUE THE LAND, BUILDING, AND EQUIPMENT. WE INCURRED $54

MILLION IN ADDITIONAL ASSET IMPAIRMENT CHARGES AS A RESULT OF

MARKET CONDITIONS RELATED TO THE COLORADO SPRINGS FACILITY

DURING 2007 AND ADDITIONAL CHARGES IN 2008. WE SOLD THE COLORADO

SPRINGS FACILITY IN 2009.

IN ADDITION, DURING 2007 WE

RECORDED LAND AND BUILDING WRITE-DOWNS RELATED TO CERTAIN

MILLION IN ASSET IMPAIRMENT CHARGES RELATED TO ASSETS THAT WE

SOLD IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE DIVESTITURE OF OUR NOR FLASH MEMORY

BUSINESS IN 2007 AND AN ADDITIONAL $275 MILLION IN 2008. WE

DETERMINED THE IMPAIRMENT CHARGES BASED ON THE FAIR VALUE, LESS

SELLING COSTS, THAT WE EXPECTED TO RECEIVE UPON COMPLETION OF

THE DIVESTITURE IN 2007, AND DETERMINED THE IMPAIRMENT CHARGES

USING THE REVISED FAIR VALUE OF THE EQUITY AND NOTE RECEIVABLE

IMPAIRMENT CHARGES. THE 2006 EFFICIENCY PLAN IS COMPLETE.

FROM THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2006

THROUGH 2009, WE INCURRED A TOTAL OF $1.6 BILLION IN

RESTRUCTURING AND ASSET IMPAIRMENT CHARGES RELATED TO THIS

PROGRAM. THESE CHARGES INCLUDED A TOTAL OF $686 MILLION RELATED

TO EMPLOYEE SEVERANCE AND BENEFIT ARRANGEMENTS FOR 11,300

EMPLOYEES. A SUBSTANTIAL MAJORITY OF THESE EMPLOYEE ACTIONS

AFFECTED EMPLOYEES WITHIN MANUFACTURING, INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY,

AND MARKETING. THE RESTRUCTURING AND ASSET IMPAIRMENT CHARGES

ALSO INCLUDED $896 MILLION IN ASSET IMPAIRMENT CHARGES.

WE ESTIMATE THAT THE TOTAL

EMPLOYEE SEVERANCE AND BENEFIT CHARGES INCURRED AS PART OF THE

2006 EFFICIENCY PROGRAM RESULT IN GROSS ANNUAL SAVINGS OF

APPROXIMATELY $1.1 BILLION. WE ARE REALIZING THESE SAVINGS

WITHIN MARKETING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE; COST OF SALES; AND

R&D.

AMORTIZATION OF

ACQUISITION-RELATED

BILLION WITH NO ASSOCIATED TAX BENEFIT. IN ADDITION, OUR 2008

EFFECTIVE TAX RATE WAS NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY THE RECOGNITION OF

A VALUATION ALLOWANCE ON OUR DEFERRED TAX ASSETS DUE TO THE

UNCERTAINTY OF REALIZING TAX BENEFITS RELATED TO IMPAIRMENTS OF

OUR EQUITY INVESTMENTS.

OUR EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE

INCREASED IN 2008 COMPARED TO 2007, PRIMARILY DUE TO THE

RECOGNITION OF A VALUATION ALLOWANCE ON OUR DEFERRED TAX ASSETS

DUE TO THE UNCERTAINTY OF REALIZING TAX BENEFITS RELATED TO

IMPAIRMENTS OF OUR EQUITY INVESTMENTS. IN ADDITION, THE RATE

INCREASED IN 2008 COMPARED TO 2007, DUE TO THE REVERSAL OF

PREVIOUSLY ACCRUED TAXES OF $481 MILLION (INCLUDING $50 MILLION

OF ACCRUED INTEREST) RELATED TO SETTLEMENTS WITH THE U.S.

INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE (IRS) IN THE FIRST AND SECOND QUARTERS

OF 2007.

OPERATING

ACTIVITIES

CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING

ACTIVITIES IS NET INCOME ADJUSTED FOR CERTAIN NON-CASH ITEMS AND

CHANGES IN CERTAIN ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. FOR 2009 COMPARED TO

2008, THE $244 MILLION INCREASE IN CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING

ACTIVITIES WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO CHANGES IN ASSETS AND

LIABILITIES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER NET INCOME. INCOME TAXES

PAID, NET OF REFUNDS IN 2009 COMPARED TO 2008 WERE

$3.1 BILLION LOWER ON LOWER INCOME BEFORE TAXES AND TIMING

OF PAYMENTS.

CHANGES IN ASSETS AND LIABILITIES

FOR 2009 COMPARED TO 2008 INCLUDED THE FOLLOWING.



INVENTORIES

DECREASED DUE TO LOWER

CHIPSET AND RAW MATERIALS INVENTORY.



ACCOUNTS PAYABLE

DECREASED DUE TO TIMING

OF PAYMENTS, DESPITE HIGHER PRODUCTION SPENDING.



ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE

INCREASED DUE TO HIGHER

REVENUE AND A HIGHER PROPORTION OF SALES AT THE END OF THE

FOURTH QUARTER OF 2009.



ACCRUED COMPENSATION AND

BENEFITS

INCREASED DUE

TO HIGHER ACCRUED PROFIT-DEPENDENT COMPENSATION.

FOR 2009 AND 2008, OUR TWO LARGEST

CUSTOMERS ACCOUNTED FOR 38% OF OUR NET REVENUE, WITH ONE OF

THESE CUSTOMERS ACCOUNTING FOR 21% OF OUR NET REVENUE IN 2009

(20% IN 2008), AND ANOTHER CUSTOMER ACCOUNTING FOR 17% OF OUR

NET REVENUE IN 2009 (18% IN 2008). THESE TWO LARGEST CUSTOMERS

ACCOUNTED FOR 41% OF OUR ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AS OF DECEMBER 26,

2009 AND DECEMBER 27, 2008.

FOR 2008 COMPARED TO 2007, THE

$1.7 BILLION DECREASE IN CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES

WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE $1.7 BILLION DECREASE IN NET INCOME,

WHILE TOTAL ADJUSTMENTS TO RECONCILE NET INCOME TO CASH PROVIDED

BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES, INCLUDING NET CHANGES IN ASSETS AND

LIABILITIES, WERE APPROXIMATELY FLAT. EFFECTIVE 2008, CASH FLOWS

RELATED TO MARKETABLE DEBT INSTRUMENTS CLASSIFIED AS TRADING

ASSETS ARE INCLUDED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES.

INVESTING

ACTIVITIES

INVESTING CASH FLOWS CONSIST

PRIMARILY OF CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, NET INVESTMENT PURCHASES,

MATURITIES, DISPOSALS, AND CASH USED FOR ACQUISITIONS.

THE INCREASE IN CASH USED FOR

INVESTING ACTIVITIES IN 2009 COMPARED TO 2008 WAS PRIMARILY DUE

TO AN INCREASE IN NET PURCHASES OF

AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE

INVESTMENTS AND TRADING ASSETS, AND HIGHER CASH PAID FOR

ACQUISITIONS. THESE INCREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A

DECREASE IN INVESTMENTS IN NON-MARKETABLE EQUITY INVESTMENTS.

OUR INVESTMENTS IN NON-MARKETABLE EQUITY INVESTMENTS IN 2008

INCLUDED $1.0 BILLION FOR AN OWNERSHIP INTEREST IN CLEARWIRE LLC.

OUR CAPITAL EXPENDITURES WERE $4.5

BILLION IN 2009 ($5.2 BILLION IN 2008 AND $5.0 BILLION IN 2007).

CAPITAL EXPENDITURES FOR 2010 ARE CURRENTLY EXPECTED TO BE

HIGHER THAN OUR 2009 EXPENDITURES AND ARE EXPECTED TO BE FUNDED

BY CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES.

THE DECREASE IN CASH USED IN

INVESTING ACTIVITIES IN 2008 COMPARED TO 2007 WAS PRIMARILY DUE

TO A DECREASE IN PURCHASES OF

AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE

DEBT INVESTMENTS. IN ADDITION, THE RELATED CASH FLOWS FOR

MARKETABLE DEBT INSTRUMENTS CLASSIFIED AS TRADING ASSETS WERE

INCLUDED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES FOR 2008, AND PREVIOUSLY THEY

HAD BEEN INCLUDED IN OPERATING ACTIVITIES.

FINANCING

ACTIVITIES

FINANCING CASH FLOWS CONSIST

PRIMARILY OF REPURCHASES AND RETIREMENT OF COMMON STOCK, PAYMENT

OF DIVIDENDS TO STOCKHOLDERS, ISSUANCE OF LONG-TERM DEBT, AND

PROCEEDS FROM THE SALE OF SHARES THROUGH EMPLOYEE EQUITY

INCENTIVE PLANS.

42

TABLE OF CONTENTS

MANAGEMENTS

DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)

THE DECREASE IN CASH USED IN

FINANCING ACTIVITIES IN 2009 COMPARED TO 2008 WAS PRIMARILY DUE

TO A DECREASE IN REPURCHASES AND RETIREMENT OF COMMON STOCK AND

THE ISSUANCE OF LONG-TERM DEBT, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER

PROCEEDS FROM SALES OF SHARES THROUGH EMPLOYEE EQUITY INCENTIVE

PLANS. WE USED THE MAJORITY OF THE PROCEEDS FROM THE 2009

ISSUANCE OF LONG-TERM DEBT TO REPURCHASE AND RETIRE COMMON

STOCK. DURING 2009, WE REPURCHASED $1.8 BILLION OF COMMON STOCK

COMPARED TO $7.2 BILLION IN 2008. AS OF DECEMBER 26, 2009, $5.7

BILLION REMAINED AVAILABLE FOR REPURCHASE UNDER THE EXISTING

REPURCHASE AUTHORIZATION OF $25 BILLION. WE BASE OUR LEVEL OF

COMMON STOCK REPURCHASES ON INTERNAL CASH MANAGEMENT DECISIONS,

AND THIS LEVEL MAY FLUCTUATE. PROCEEDS FROM THE SALE OF SHARES

THROUGH EMPLOYEE EQUITY INCENTIVE PLANS TOTALED $400 MILLION IN

2009 COMPARED TO $1.1 BILLION IN 2008 AS A RESULT OF A LOWER

VOLUME OF EMPLOYEE EXERCISES OF STOCK OPTIONS. OUR TOTAL

DIVIDEND PAYMENTS IN 2009 REMAINED FLAT FROM 2008 AT $3.1

BILLION. WE HAVE PAID A CASH DIVIDEND IN EACH OF THE PAST 69

QUARTERS. IN JANUARY 2010, OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS DECLARED A

CASH DIVIDEND OF $0.1575 PER COMMON SHARE FOR THE FIRST QUARTER

OF 2010. THE DIVIDEND IS PAYABLE ON MARCH 1, 2010 TO

STOCKHOLDERS OF RECORD ON FEBRUARY 7, 2010.

THE HIGHER CASH USED IN FINANCING

ACTIVITIES IN 2008 COMPARED TO 2007 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO AN

INCREASE IN REPURCHASES AND RETIREMENT OF COMMON STOCK, AND

LOWER PROCEEDS FROM THE SALE OF SHARES PURSUANT TO EMPLOYEE

EQUITY INCENTIVE PLANS.

LIQUIDITY

CASH GENERATED BY OPERATIONS IS

USED AS OUR PRIMARY SOURCE OF LIQUIDITY. AS OF DECEMBER 26,

2009, CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS, DEBT INSTRUMENTS INCLUDED IN

TRADING ASSETS, AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS TOTALED $13.9

BILLION. IN ADDITION TO THE $13.9 BILLION, WE HAVE $4.5 BILLION

IN LOANS RECEIVABLE AND OTHER LONG-TERM INVESTMENTS THAT WE

INCLUDE WHEN ASSESSING OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO.

THE CREDIT QUALITY OF OUR

INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO REMAINS HIGH, WITH CREDIT-RELATED

OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY

IMPAIRMENT LOSSES ON OUR

AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE

DEBT INSTRUMENTS LIMITED TO LESS THAN $55 MILLION CUMULATIVELY

SINCE THE BEGINNING OF 2008. IN ADDITION, WE CONTINUE TO BE ABLE

TO INVEST IN HIGH-CREDIT-QUALITY INVESTMENTS. SUBSTANTIALLY ALL

OF OUR INVESTMENTS IN DEBT INSTRUMENTS ARE WITH A/A2 OR BETTER

RATED ISSUERS, AND A SUBSTANTIAL MAJORITY OF THE ISSUERS ARE

RATED AA-/AA3 OR BETTER.

AS OF DECEMBER 26, 2009,

CUMULATIVE UNREALIZED GAINS, NET OF CORRESPONDING HEDGING

ACTIVITIES, RELATED TO DEBT INSTRUMENTS CLASSIFIED AS TRADING

ASSETS, AND CUMULATIVE UNREALIZED GAINS RELATED TO DEBT

INSTRUMENTS CLASSIFIED AS AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE, WERE

INSIGNIFICANT. AS OF DECEMBER 27, 2008, OUR CUMULATIVE

UNREALIZED LOSSES, NET OF CORRESPONDING HEDGING ACTIVITIES,

RELATED TO DEBT INSTRUMENTS CLASSIFIED AS TRADING ASSETS WERE

$145 MILLION. AS OF DECEMBER 27, 2008, OUR CUMULATIVE UNREALIZED

LOSSES RELATED TO DEBT INSTRUMENTS CLASSIFIED AS

AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE

WERE $215 MILLION.

OUR COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAM

PROVIDES ANOTHER POTENTIAL SOURCE OF LIQUIDITY. WE HAVE AN

ONGOING AUTHORIZATION FROM OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS TO BORROW UP

TO $3.0 BILLION, INCLUDING THROUGH THE ISSUANCE OF COMMERCIAL

PAPER. MAXIMUM BORROWINGS UNDER OUR COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAM

DURING 2009 WERE $610 MILLION, ALTHOUGH NO COMMERCIAL PAPER

REMAINED OUTSTANDING AS OF DECEMBER 26, 2009. OUR COMMERCIAL

PAPER WAS RATED

A-1+

BY

STANDARD & POORS AND

P-1

BY

MOODYS AS OF DECEMBER 26, 2009. WE ALSO HAVE AN AUTOMATIC

SHELF REGISTRATION STATEMENT ON FILE WITH THE SEC PURSUANT TO

WHICH WE MAY OFFER AN UNSPECIFIED AMOUNT OF DEBT, EQUITY, AND

OTHER SECURITIES.

WE BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE THE

FINANCIAL RESOURCES NEEDED TO MEET BUSINESS REQUIREMENTS FOR THE

NEXT 12 MONTHS, INCLUDING CAPITAL EXPENDITURES FOR WORLDWIDE

MANUFACTURING AND ASSEMBLY AND TEST, WORKING CAPITAL

REQUIREMENTS, AND POTENTIAL DIVIDENDS, COMMON STOCK REPURCHASES,

AND ACQUISITIONS OR STRATEGIC INVESTMENTS.

FAIR

VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

FAIR VALUE IS THE PRICE THAT WOULD

BE RECEIVED FROM SELLING AN ASSET OR PAID TO TRANSFER A

LIABILITY IN AN ORDERLY TRANSACTION BETWEEN MARKET PARTICIPANTS

AT THE MEASUREMENT DATE. WHEN DETERMINING FAIR VALUE, WE

CONSIDER THE PRINCIPAL OR MOST ADVANTAGEOUS MARKET IN WHICH WE

WOULD TRANSACT, AND WE CONSIDER ASSUMPTIONS THAT MARKET

PARTICIPANTS WOULD USE WHEN PRICING THE ASSET OR LIABILITY. SEE

NOTE 5: FAIR VALUE IN PART II, ITEM 8 OF THIS FORM

10-K.

CREDIT RISK IS FACTORED INTO THE

VALUATION OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS THAT WE MEASURE AND RECORD AT

FAIR VALUE ON A RECURRING BASIS. WHEN FAIR VALUE IS DETERMINED

USING OBSERVABLE MARKET PRICES, THE CREDIT RISK IS INCORPORATED

INTO THE MARKET PRICE OF THE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT. WHEN FAIR

VALUE IS DETERMINED USING PRICING MODELS, SUCH AS A DISCOUNTED

CASH FLOW MODEL, THE ISSUERS CREDIT RISK

AND/OR

INTELS CREDIT RISK IS FACTORED INTO THE CALCULATION OF THE

FAIR VALUE, AS APPROPRIATE.

MARKETABLE

DEBT INSTRUMENTS

AS OF DECEMBER 26, 2009, OUR

ASSETS MEASURED AND RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE ON A RECURRING BASIS

INCLUDED $17.5 BILLION OF MARKETABLE DEBT INSTRUMENTS. OF THESE

INSTRUMENTS, $657 MILLION WAS CLASSIFIED AS LEVEL 1, $15.8

BILLION AS LEVEL 2, AND $1.1 BILLION AS LEVEL 3.

WHEN AVAILABLE, WE USE OBSERVABLE

MARKET PRICES FOR IDENTICAL SECURITIES TO VALUE OUR MARKETABLE

DEBT INSTRUMENTS. IF OBSERVABLE MARKET PRICES ARE NOT AVAILABLE,

WE USE NON-BINDING MARKET CONSENSUS PRICES THAT WE SEEK TO

CORROBORATE WITH OBSERVABLE MARKET DATA, IF AVAILABLE, OR

UNOBSERVABLE MARKET DATA. WHEN PRICES FROM MULTIPLE SOURCES ARE

AVAILABLE FOR A GIVEN INSTRUMENT, WE USE OBSERVABLE MARKET

QUOTES TO PRICE OUR INSTRUMENTS, IN LIEU OF PRICES FROM OTHER

SOURCES.

OUR BALANCE OF MARKETABLE DEBT

INSTRUMENTS THAT ARE MEASURED AND RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE ON A

RECURRING BASIS AND CLASSIFIED AS LEVEL 1 WAS CLASSIFIED AS SUCH

DUE TO THE USAGE OF OBSERVABLE MARKET PRICES FOR IDENTICAL

SECURITIES THAT ARE TRADED IN ACTIVE MARKETS. MARKETABLE DEBT

INSTRUMENTS IN THIS CATEGORY GENERALLY INCLUDE CERTAIN OF OUR

CORPORATE BONDS, GOVERNMENT BONDS, AND MONEY MARKET FUND

DEPOSITS. MANAGEMENT JUDGMENT WAS REQUIRED TO DETERMINE THE

LEVELS AT WHICH SUFFICIENT VOLUME AND FREQUENCY OF TRANSACTIONS

ARE MET FOR A MARKET TO BE CONSIDERED ACTIVE. OUR ASSESSMENT OF

AN ACTIVE MARKET FOR OUR MARKETABLE DEBT INSTRUMENTS GENERALLY

TAKES INTO CONSIDERATION ACTIVITY DURING EACH WEEK OF THE

ONE-MONTH PERIOD PRIOR TO THE VALUATION DATE OF EACH INDIVIDUAL

INSTRUMENT, INCLUDING THE NUMBER OF DAYS EACH INDIVIDUAL

INSTRUMENT TRADES AND THE AVERAGE WEEKLY TRADING VOLUME IN

RELATION TO THE TOTAL OUTSTANDING AMOUNT OF THE ISSUED

INSTRUMENT.

APPROXIMATELY 10% OF OUR BALANCE

OF MARKETABLE DEBT INSTRUMENTS THAT ARE MEASURED AND RECORDED AT

FAIR VALUE ON A RECURRING BASIS AND CLASSIFIED AS LEVEL 2 WAS

CLASSIFIED AS SUCH DUE TO THE USAGE OF OBSERVABLE MARKET PRICES

FOR IDENTICAL SECURITIES THAT ARE TRADED IN LESS ACTIVE MARKETS.

WHEN OBSERVABLE MARKET PRICES FOR IDENTICAL SECURITIES ARE NOT

AVAILABLE, WE PRICE OUR MARKETABLE DEBT INSTRUMENTS USING

NON-BINDING

MARKET CONSENSUS PRICES THAT ARE CORROBORATED WITH OBSERVABLE

MARKET DATA; QUOTED MARKET PRICES FOR SIMILAR INSTRUMENTS; OR

PRICING MODELS, SUCH AS A DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW MODEL, WITH ALL

SIGNIFICANT INPUTS DERIVED FROM OR CORROBORATED WITH OBSERVABLE

MARKET DATA.

NON-BINDING

MARKET CONSENSUS PRICES ARE BASED ON THE PROPRIETARY VALUATION

MODELS OF PRICING PROVIDERS OR BROKERS. THESE VALUATION MODELS

INCORPORATE A NUMBER OF INPUTS, INCLUDING NON-BINDING AND

BINDING BROKER QUOTES; OBSERVABLE MARKET PRICES FOR IDENTICAL

AND/OR

SIMILAR SECURITIES; AND THE INTERNAL ASSUMPTIONS OF PRICING

PROVIDERS OR BROKERS THAT USE OBSERVABLE MARKET INPUTS AND, TO A

LESSER DEGREE, UNOBSERVABLE MARKET INPUTS. WE CORROBORATE THE

NON-BINDING MARKET CONSENSUS PRICES WITH OBSERVABLE MARKET DATA

USING STATISTICAL MODELS WHEN OBSERVABLE MARKET DATA EXISTS. THE

DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW MODEL USES OBSERVABLE MARKET INPUTS, SUCH

AS LIBOR-BASED YIELD CURVES, CURRENCY SPOT AND FORWARD RATES,

AND CREDIT RATINGS. APPROXIMATELY 40% OF OUR BALANCE OF

MARKETABLE DEBT INSTRUMENTS THAT ARE MEASURED AND RECORDED AT

FAIR VALUE ON A RECURRING BASIS AND CLASSIFIED AS LEVEL 2 WAS

CLASSIFIED AS SUCH DUE TO THE USAGE OF NON-BINDING MARKET

CONSENSUS PRICES THAT ARE CORROBORATED WITH OBSERVABLE MARKET

DATA, AND APPROXIMATELY 50% DUE TO THE USAGE OF A DISCOUNTED

CASH FLOW MODEL. MARKETABLE DEBT INSTRUMENTS CLASSIFIED AS LEVEL

2 GENERALLY INCLUDE COMMERCIAL PAPER, BANK TIME DEPOSITS,

MUNICIPAL BONDS, CERTAIN OF OUR MONEY MARKET FUND DEPOSITS, AND

A MAJORITY OF CORPORATE BONDS AND GOVERNMENT BONDS.

OUR MARKETABLE DEBT INSTRUMENTS

THAT ARE MEASURED AND RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE ON A RECURRING

BASIS AND CLASSIFIED AS LEVEL 3 WERE CLASSIFIED AS SUCH DUE TO

THE LACK OF OBSERVABLE MARKET DATA TO CORROBORATE EITHER THE

NON-BINDING MARKET CONSENSUS PRICES OR THE NON-BINDING BROKER

QUOTES. WHEN OBSERVABLE MARKET DATA IS NOT AVAILABLE, WE

CORROBORATE THE NON-BINDING MARKET CONSENSUS PRICES AND

NON-BINDING BROKER QUOTES USING UNOBSERVABLE DATA, IF AVAILABLE.

MARKETABLE DEBT INSTRUMENTS IN THIS CATEGORY GENERALLY INCLUDE

ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES AND CERTAIN OF OUR CORPORATE BONDS. ALL

OF OUR INVESTMENTS IN ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES WERE CLASSIFIED AS

LEVEL 3, AND SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THEM WERE VALUED USING

NON-BINDING MARKET CONSENSUS PRICES THAT WE WERE NOT ABLE TO

CORROBORATE WITH OBSERVABLE MARKET DATA DUE TO THE LACK OF

TRANSPARENCY IN THE MARKET FOR ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES.

EQUITY

SECURITIES

AS OF DECEMBER 26, 2009, OUR

PORTFOLIO OF ASSETS MEASURED AND RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE ON A

RECURRING BASIS INCLUDED $773 MILLION OF MARKETABLE EQUITY

SECURITIES. OF THESE SECURITIES, $676 MILLION WAS CLASSIFIED AS

LEVEL 1 BECAUSE THE VALUATIONS WERE BASED ON QUOTED PRICES FOR

IDENTICAL SECURITIES IN ACTIVE MARKETS. OUR ASSESSMENT OF AN

ACTIVE MARKET FOR OUR MARKETABLE EQUITY SECURITIES GENERALLY

TAKES INTO CONSIDERATION ACTIVITY DURING EACH WEEK OF THE

ONE-MONTH PERIOD PRIOR TO THE VALUATION DATE FOR EACH INDIVIDUAL

SECURITY, INCLUDING THE NUMBER OF DAYS EACH INDIVIDUAL EQUITY

SECURITY TRADES AND THE AVERAGE WEEKLY TRADING VOLUME IN

RELATION TO THE TOTAL OUTSTANDING SHARES OF THAT SECURITY. THE

REMAINING MARKETABLE EQUITY SECURITIES OF $97 MILLION WERE

CLASSIFIED AS LEVEL 2 BECAUSE THEIR VALUATIONS WERE EITHER BASED

ON QUOTED PRICES FOR IDENTICAL SECURITIES IN LESS ACTIVE MARKETS

OR ADJUSTED FOR SECURITY-SPECIFIC RESTRICTIONS.

WERE NOT RECORDED AS LIABILITIES ON OUR CONSOLIDATED BALANCE

SHEETS AS OF DECEMBER 26, 2009, AS WE HAD NOT YET RECEIVED THE

RELATED GOODS OR TAKEN TITLE TO THE PROPERTY. CAPITAL PURCHASE

OBLIGATIONS DECREASED FROM $2.9 BILLION AS OF DECEMBER 27, 2008

TO $1.8 BILLION AS OF DECEMBER 26, 2009, PRIMARILY DUE TO THE

TIMING OF THE RAMP OF OUR LATEST SILICON PROCESS TECHNOLOGY.

2

OTHER PURCHASE OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS INCLUDE PAYMENTS

DUE UNDER VARIOUS TYPES OF LICENSES AND AGREEMENTS TO PURCHASE

RAW MATERIALS OR OTHER GOODS, AS WELL AS PAYMENTS DUE UNDER

NON-CONTINGENT FUNDING OBLIGATIONS. FUNDING OBLIGATIONS INCLUDE,

FOR EXAMPLE, AGREEMENTS TO FUND VARIOUS PROJECTS WITH OTHER

COMPANIES.

3

AMOUNTS REPRESENT PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST CASH PAYMENTS OVER

THE LIFE OF THE DEBT OBLIGATIONS, INCLUDING ANTICIPATED INTEREST

PAYMENTS THAT ARE NOT RECORDED ON OUR CONSOLIDATED BALANCE

SHEETS. ANY FUTURE SETTLEMENT OF CONVERTIBLE DEBT WOULD IMPACT

OUR CASH PAYMENTS.

4

WE ARE UNABLE TO RELIABLY ESTIMATE THE TIMING OF FUTURE

PAYMENTS RELATED TO UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS; THEREFORE, $193

MILLION OF LONG-TERM INCOME TAXES PAYABLE HAS BEEN EXCLUDED FROM

THE TABLE ABOVE. HOWEVER, LONG-TERM INCOME TAXES PAYABLE,

INCLUDED ON OUR CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS, INCLUDED THESE

UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS, REDUCED BY THE ASSOCIATED FEDERAL

DEDUCTION FOR STATE TAXES AND U.S. TAX CREDITS ARISING FROM

NON-U.S.

INCOME.

5

AMOUNTS REPRESENT FUTURE CASH PAYMENTS TO SATISFY OTHER

LONG-TERM LIABILITIES RECORDED ON OUR CONSOLIDATED BALANCE

SHEETS, INCLUDING THE SHORT-TERM PORTION OF THESE LONG-TERM

LIABILITIES. EXPECTED CONTRIBUTIONS TO OUR U.S. AND

NON-U.S.

PENSION PLANS AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS OF $60

MILLION TO BE MADE DURING 2010 ARE ALSO INCLUDED; HOWEVER,

FUNDING PROJECTIONS BEYOND 2010 ARE NOT PRACTICAL TO

ESTIMATE.

6

TOTAL GENERALLY EXCLUDES CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS ALREADY

RECORDED ON OUR CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS AS CURRENT

LIABILITIES.

CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS FOR

PURCHASES OF GOODS OR SERVICES GENERALLY INCLUDE AGREEMENTS THAT

ARE ENFORCEABLE AND LEGALLY BINDING ON INTEL AND THAT SPECIFY

ALL SIGNIFICANT TERMS, INCLUDING FIXED OR MINIMUM QUANTITIES TO

BE PURCHASED; FIXED, MINIMUM, OR VARIABLE PRICE PROVISIONS; AND

THE APPROXIMATE TIMING OF THE TRANSACTION. THE TABLE ABOVE ALSO

INCLUDES AGREEMENTS TO PURCHASE RAW MATERIALS THAT HAVE

CANCELLATION PROVISIONS REQUIRING LITTLE OR NO PAYMENT. THE

AMOUNTS UNDER SUCH CONTRACTS ARE INCLUDED IN THE TABLE ABOVE

BECAUSE MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT CANCELLATION OF THESE CONTRACTS

IS UNLIKELY AND EXPECTS TO MAKE FUTURE CASH PAYMENTS ACCORDING

TO THE CONTRACT TERMS OR IN SIMILAR AMOUNTS FOR SIMILAR

MATERIALS. FOR OTHER OBLIGATIONS WITH CANCELLATION PROVISIONS,

THE AMOUNTS INCLUDED IN THE TABLE ABOVE WERE LIMITED TO THE

NON-CANCELABLE PORTION OF THE AGREEMENT TERMS

AND/OR

THE

MINIMUM CANCELLATION FEE.

WE HAVE ENTERED INTO CERTAIN

AGREEMENTS FOR THE PURCHASE OF RAW MATERIALS OR OTHER GOODS THAT

SPECIFY MINIMUM PRICES AND QUANTITIES BASED ON A PERCENTAGE OF

THE TOTAL AVAILABLE MARKET OR BASED ON A PERCENTAGE OF OUR

FUTURE PURCHASING REQUIREMENTS. DUE TO THE UNCERTAINTY OF THE

FUTURE MARKET AND OUR FUTURE PURCHASING REQUIREMENTS,

OBLIGATIONS UNDER THESE AGREEMENTS ARE NOT INCLUDED IN THE TABLE

ABOVE. WE ESTIMATE OUR OBLIGATION UNDER THESE AGREEMENTS AS OF

DECEMBER 26, 2009 TO BE APPROXIMATELY AS FOLLOWS: LESS THAN ONE

YEAR$364 MILLION; ONE TO THREE YEARS$3 MILLION; MORE

THAN THREE YEARSZERO. OUR PURCHASE ORDERS FOR OTHER

PRODUCTS ARE BASED ON OUR CURRENT MANUFACTURING NEEDS AND ARE

FULFILLED BY OUR VENDORS WITHIN SHORT TIME HORIZONS. IN

ADDITION, SOME OF OUR PURCHASE ORDERS REPRESENT AUTHORIZATIONS

TO PURCHASE RATHER THAN BINDING AGREEMENTS.

CONTINGENT UPON THE ACHIEVEMENT OF CERTAIN MILESTONES ARE NOT

INCLUDED IN THE TABLE ABOVE. THESE OBLIGATIONS INCLUDE

CONTINGENT FUNDING/PAYMENT OBLIGATIONS AND MILESTONE-BASED

EQUITY INVESTMENT FUNDING. THESE ARRANGEMENTS ARE NOT CONSIDERED

CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS UNTIL THE MILESTONE IS MET BY THE THIRD

PARTY. ASSUMING THAT ALL FUTURE MILESTONES ARE MET, ADDITIONAL

REQUIRED PAYMENTS RELATED TO THESE OBLIGATIONS WERE NOT

SIGNIFICANT AS OF DECEMBER 26, 2009.

FOR THE MAJORITY OF RESTRICTED

STOCK UNITS GRANTED, THE NUMBER OF SHARES ISSUED ON THE DATE THE

RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS VEST IS NET OF THE MINIMUM STATUTORY

WITHHOLDING REQUIREMENTS THAT WE PAY IN CASH TO THE APPROPRIATE

TAXING AUTHORITIES ON BEHALF OF OUR EMPLOYEES. THE OBLIGATION TO

PAY THE RELATIVE TAXING AUTHORITY IS NOT INCLUDED IN THE TABLE

ABOVE, AS THE AMOUNT IS CONTINGENT UPON CONTINUED EMPLOYMENT. IN

ADDITION, THE AMOUNT OF THE OBLIGATION IS UNKNOWN, AS IT IS

BASED IN PART ON THE MARKET PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK WHEN THE

AWARDS VEST.

WE HAVE A CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATION

TO PURCHASE THE OUTPUT OF IMFT IN PROPORTION TO OUR INVESTMENTS,

49% AS OF DECEMBER 26, 2009. WE ALSO HAVE SEVERAL AGREEMENTS

WITH MICRON RELATED TO INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS, AND

R&D FUNDING RELATED TO NAND FLASH MANUFACTURING AND IMFT.

THE OBLIGATION TO PURCHASE OUR PROPORTION OF IMFTS

THE EXPECTED TIMING OF PAYMENTS OF

THE OBLIGATIONS ABOVE ARE ESTIMATES BASED ON CURRENT

INFORMATION. TIMING OF PAYMENTS AND ACTUAL AMOUNTS PAID MAY BE

DIFFERENT, DEPENDING ON THE TIME OF RECEIPT OF GOODS OR

SERVICES, OR CHANGES TO

AGREED-UPON

AMOUNTS FOR SOME OBLIGATIONS.

OFF-BALANCE-SHEET

ARRANGEMENTS

AS OF DECEMBER 26, 2009, WITH THE

EXCEPTION OF A GUARANTEE FOR THE REPAYMENT OF $275 MILLION IN

PRINCIPAL OF THE PAYMENT OBLIGATIONS OF NUMONYX UNDER ITS SENIOR

CREDIT FACILITY, AS WELL AS ACCRUED UNPAID INTEREST, EXPENSES OF

THE LENDERS, AND PENALTIES, WE DID NOT HAVE ANY SIGNIFICANT

OFF-BALANCE-SHEET ARRANGEMENTS, AS DEFINED IN ITEM 303(A)(4)(II)

OF SEC REGULATION

S-K.

IN

FEBRUARY 2010, WE SIGNED A DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT WITH MICRON AND

NUMONYX UNDER WHICH MICRON AGREED TO ACQUIRE NUMONYX IN AN

ALL-STOCK TRANSACTION. THE SENIOR CREDIT FACILITY THAT IS

SUPPORTED BY INTELS GUARANTEE IS EXPECTED TO BE REPAID IN

FULL FOLLOWING THE CLOSING OF THIS TRANSACTION. SEE NOTE

QUANTITATIVE

AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

WE USE DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL

INSTRUMENTS PRIMARILY TO MANAGE CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE AND

INTEREST RATE RISK, AND TO A LESSER EXTENT, EQUITY MARKET AND

COMMODITY PRICE RISK. ALL OF THE POTENTIAL CHANGES NOTED BELOW

ARE BASED ON SENSITIVITY ANALYSES PERFORMED ON OUR FINANCIAL

POSITIONS AS OF DECEMBER 26, 2009 AND DECEMBER 27, 2008. ACTUAL

RESULTS MAY DIFFER MATERIALLY.

CURRENCY

EXCHANGE RATES

WE GENERALLY HEDGE CURRENCY RISKS

OF

NON-U.S.-DOLLAR-DENOMINATED

INVESTMENTS IN DEBT INSTRUMENTS AND LOANS RECEIVABLE WITH

OFFSETTING CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS, CURRENCY OPTIONS, OR

CURRENCY INTEREST RATE SWAPS. GAINS AND LOSSES ON THESE

NON-U.S.-CURRENCY

INVESTMENTS WOULD GENERALLY BE OFFSET BY CORRESPONDING LOSSES

AND GAINS ON THE RELATED HEDGING INSTRUMENTS, RESULTING IN A

NEGLIGIBLE NET EXPOSURE TO LOSS.

SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR REVENUE

AND A MAJORITY OF OUR EXPENSE AND CAPITAL PURCHASING ACTIVITIES

ARE TRANSACTED IN U.S. DOLLARS. HOWEVER, CERTAIN OPERATING

EXPENDITURES AND CAPITAL PURCHASES ARE INCURRED IN OR EXPOSED TO

OTHER CURRENCIES, PRIMARILY THE JAPANESE YEN, THE EURO, AND THE

ISRAELI SHEKEL. WE HAVE ESTABLISHED BALANCE SHEET AND FORECASTED

TRANSACTION CURRENCY RISK MANAGEMENT PROGRAMS TO PROTECT AGAINST

FLUCTUATIONS IN FAIR VALUE AND THE VOLATILITY OF FUTURE CASH

FLOWS CAUSED BY CHANGES IN EXCHANGE RATES. WE GENERALLY UTILIZE

CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS AND, TO A LESSER EXTENT, CURRENCY

OPTIONS IN THESE HEDGING PROGRAMS. OUR HEDGING PROGRAMS REDUCE,

BUT DO NOT ALWAYS ENTIRELY ELIMINATE, THE IMPACT OF CURRENCY

EXCHANGE RATE MOVEMENTS (SEE RISK FACTORS IN PART I,

ITEM 1A OF THIS FORM

10-K).

WE

CONSIDERED THE HISTORICAL TRENDS IN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES AND

DETERMINED THAT IT WAS REASONABLY POSSIBLE THAT A WEIGHTED

AVERAGE ADVERSE CHANGE OF 20% IN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES COULD

BE EXPERIENCED IN THE NEAR TERM. SUCH AN ADVERSE CHANGE, AFTER

TAKING INTO ACCOUNT HEDGES AND OFFSETTING POSITIONS, WOULD HAVE

RESULTED IN AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON INCOME BEFORE TAXES OF LESS

THAN $40 MILLION AS OF DECEMBER 26, 2009 (LESS THAN $55 MILLION

AS OF DECEMBER 27, 2008).

INTEREST

RATES

WE ARE EXPOSED TO INTEREST RATE

RISK RELATED TO OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO AND DEBT ISSUANCES. THE

PRIMARY OBJECTIVE OF OUR INVESTMENTS IN DEBT INSTRUMENTS IS TO

PRESERVE PRINCIPAL WHILE MAXIMIZING YIELDS. TO ACHIEVE THIS

OBJECTIVE, THE RETURNS ON OUR INVESTMENTS IN DEBT INSTRUMENTS

ARE GENERALLY BASED ON THE

U.S.-DOLLAR

THREE-MONTH LIBOR. A HYPOTHETICAL DECREASE IN INTEREST RATES OF

1.0% WOULD HAVE RESULTED IN AN INCREASE IN THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR

DEBT ISSUANCES OF APPROXIMATELY $205 MILLION AS OF DECEMBER 26,

2009 (AN INCREASE OF APPROXIMATELY $150 MILLION AS OF DECEMBER

27, 2008). A HYPOTHETICAL DECREASE IN INTEREST RATES OF UP TO

1.0% WOULD HAVE RESULTED IN AN INCREASE IN THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR

INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO OF APPROXIMATELY $10 MILLION AS OF DECEMBER

26, 2009 (AN INCREASE OF APPROXIMATELY $15 MILLION AS OF

DECEMBER 27, 2008). THESE HYPOTHETICAL DECREASES IN INTEREST

RATES, AFTER TAKING INTO ACCOUNT HEDGES AND OFFSETTING

POSITIONS, WOULD HAVE RESULTED IN A DECREASE IN THE FAIR VALUE

OF OUR NET INVESTMENT POSITION OF APPROXIMATELY $195 MILLION AS

OF DECEMBER 26, 2009 AND $135 MILLION AS OF DECEMBER 27, 2008.

THE FLUCTUATIONS IN FAIR VALUE OF OUR DEBT ISSUANCES AND

INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO REFLECT ONLY THE DIRECT IMPACT OF THE

CHANGE IN INTEREST RATES. OTHER ECONOMIC VARIABLES, SUCH AS

EQUITY MARKET FLUCTUATIONS AND CHANGES IN RELATIVE CREDIT RISK,

COULD RESULT IN A SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER DECLINE IN OUR NET

INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ON HOW CREDIT RISK

IS FACTORED INTO THE VALUATION OF OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO AND

DEBT ISSUANCES, SEE FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL

INSTRUMENTS IN PART II, ITEM 7 OF THIS FORM

10-K.

EQUITY

PRICES

OUR MARKETABLE EQUITY INVESTMENTS

INCLUDE MARKETABLE EQUITY SECURITIES AND EQUITY DERIVATIVE

INSTRUMENTS SUCH AS WARRANTS AND OPTIONS. TO THE EXTENT THAT OUR

MARKETABLE EQUITY SECURITIES HAVE STRATEGIC VALUE, WE TYPICALLY

DO NOT ATTEMPT TO REDUCE OR ELIMINATE OUR EQUITY MARKET EXPOSURE

THROUGH HEDGING ACTIVITIES; HOWEVER, FOR OUR INVESTMENTS IN

STRATEGIC EQUITY DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS, INCLUDING WARRANTS, WE

MAY ENTER INTO TRANSACTIONS TO REDUCE OR ELIMINATE THE EQUITY

MARKET RISKS. FOR SECURITIES THAT WE NO LONGER CONSIDER

STRATEGIC, WE EVALUATE LEGAL, MARKET, AND ECONOMIC FACTORS IN

OUR DECISION ON THE TIMING OF DISPOSAL AND WHETHER IT IS

POSSIBLE AND APPROPRIATE TO HEDGE THE EQUITY MARKET RISK.

WE HOLD DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS

THAT SEEK TO OFFSET CHANGES IN LIABILITIES RELATED TO THE EQUITY

MARKET RISKS OF CERTAIN DEFERRED COMPENSATION ARRANGEMENTS. THE

GAINS AND LOSSES FROM CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE OF THESE DERIVATIVES

ARE DESIGNED TO OFFSET THE GAINS AND LOSSES ON THE RELATED

LIABILITIES, RESULTING IN AN INSIGNIFICANT NET EXPOSURE TO LOSS.

47

TABLE OF CONTENTS

AS OF DECEMBER 26, 2009, THE FAIR

VALUE OF OUR MARKETABLE EQUITY SECURITIES AND OUR EQUITY

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS, INCLUDING HEDGING POSITIONS, WAS $805

MILLION ($362 MILLION AS OF DECEMBER 27, 2008). OUR MARKETABLE

EQUITY SECURITIES INCLUDE OUR INVESTMENTS IN CLEARWIRE

CORPORATION AND MICRON, CARRIED AT A FAIR MARKET VALUE OF $250

MILLION AND $148 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, AS OF DECEMBER 26, 2009.

TO DETERMINE REASONABLY POSSIBLE DECREASES IN THE MARKET VALUE

OF OUR MARKETABLE EQUITY INVESTMENTS, WE ANALYZED THE EXPECTED

MARKET PRICE SENSITIVITY OF OUR MARKETABLE EQUITY INVESTMENT

PORTFOLIO. ASSUMING A LOSS OF 50% IN MARKET PRICES, AND AFTER

REFLECTING THE IMPACT OF HEDGES AND OFFSETTING POSITIONS, THE

AGGREGATE VALUE OF OUR MARKETABLE EQUITY INVESTMENTS COULD

DECREASE BY APPROXIMATELY $405 MILLION, BASED ON THE VALUE AS OF

DECEMBER 26, 2009 (A DECREASE IN VALUE OF APPROXIMATELY $220

MILLION, BASED ON THE VALUE AS OF DECEMBER 27, 2008 USING AN

ASSUMED LOSS OF 60%). THE DECREASE IN THE ASSUMED LOSS

PERCENTAGE FROM DECEMBER 27, 2008 TO DECEMBER 26, 2009 IS DUE TO

LOWER EXPECTED OVERALL EQUITY MARKET VOLATILITY.

MANY OF THE SAME FACTORS THAT

COULD RESULT IN AN ADVERSE MOVEMENT OF EQUITY MARKET PRICES

AFFECT OUR NON-MARKETABLE EQUITY INVESTMENTS, ALTHOUGH WE CANNOT

ALWAYS QUANTIFY THE IMPACT DIRECTLY. FINANCIAL MARKETS AND

CREDIT MARKETS ARE VOLATILE, WHICH COULD NEGATIVELY AFFECT THE

PROSPECTS OF THE COMPANIES WE INVEST IN, THEIR ABILITY TO RAISE

ADDITIONAL CAPITAL, AND THE LIKELIHOOD OF OUR BEING ABLE TO

REALIZE VALUE IN OUR INVESTMENTS THROUGH LIQUIDITY EVENTS SUCH

AS INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERINGS, MERGERS, AND PRIVATE SALES. THESE

TYPES OF INVESTMENTS INVOLVE A GREAT DEAL OF RISK, AND THERE CAN

BE NO ASSURANCE THAT ANY SPECIFIC COMPANY WILL GROW OR BECOME

SUCCESSFUL; CONSEQUENTLY, WE COULD LOSE ALL OR PART OF OUR

INVESTMENT. OUR NON-MARKETABLE EQUITY INVESTMENTS, EXCLUDING

INVESTMENTS ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER THE EQUITY METHOD, HAD A

CARRYING AMOUNT OF $939 MILLION AS OF DECEMBER 26, 2009 ($1.0

BILLION AS OF DECEMBER 27, 2008). AS OF DECEMBER 26, 2009, THE

CARRYING AMOUNT OF OUR NON-MARKETABLE EQUITY METHOD INVESTMENTS

WAS $2.5 BILLION ($3.0 BILLION AS OF DECEMBER 27, 2008). A

SUBSTANTIAL MAJORITY OF THIS BALANCE AS OF DECEMBER 26, 2009 WAS

CONCENTRATED IN COMPANIES IN THE FLASH MEMORY MARKET SEGMENT.

OUR FLASH MEMORY MARKET SEGMENT INVESTMENTS INCLUDE OUR

INVESTMENT OF $1.6 BILLION IN IMFT/IMFS ($2.1 BILLION AS OF

DECEMBER 27, 2008) AND $453 MILLION IN NUMONYX ($484 MILLION AS

OF DECEMBER 27, 2008).

IN FEBRUARY 2010, WE SIGNED A

DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT WITH MICRON AND NUMONYX UNDER WHICH MICRON

AGREED TO ACQUIRE NUMONYX IN AN ALL-STOCK TRANSACTION. THE VALUE

OF THE MICRON COMMON STOCK THAT WE WOULD RECEIVE UPON THE

CLOSING OF THE TRANSACTION IS SUBJECT TO EQUITY MARKET RISK. FOR

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 1.

BASIS OF PRESENTATION

WE HAVE A 52- OR 53-WEEK FISCAL

YEAR THAT ENDS ON THE LAST SATURDAY IN DECEMBER. FISCAL YEARS

2009, 2008, AND 2007 WERE ALL 52-WEEK YEARS. OUR CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDE THE ACCOUNTS OF INTEL CORPORATION

AND OUR WHOLLY OWNED SUBSIDIARIES. INTERCOMPANY ACCOUNTS AND

TRANSACTIONS HAVE BEEN ELIMINATED. WE USE THE EQUITY METHOD TO

ACCOUNT FOR EQUITY INVESTMENTS IN INSTANCES IN WHICH WE OWN

COMMON STOCK OR SIMILAR INTERESTS, AND HAVE THE ABILITY TO

EXERCISE SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE, BUT NOT CONTROL, OVER THE

INVESTEE. THE U.S. DOLLAR IS THE FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY FOR INTEL

AND OUR SUBSIDIARIES; THEREFORE, WE DO NOT HAVE A TRANSLATION

ADJUSTMENT RECORDED THROUGH ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE

INCOME (LOSS).

CUSTOMER CREDIT BALANCES ARE

INCLUDED IN OTHER ACCRUED LIABILITIES AND WERE $293 MILLION AS

OF DECEMBER 26, 2009 ($447 MILLION AS OF DECEMBER 27, 2008).

WE HAVE EVALUATED SUBSEQUENT

EVENTS THROUGH THE DATE THAT THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS WERE

ISSUED ON FEBRUARY 22, 2010.

ESTIMATES

THE PREPARATION OF CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN CONFORMITY WITH U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED

ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES REQUIRES US TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND

JUDGMENTS THAT AFFECT THE AMOUNTS REPORTED IN OUR CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND THE ACCOMPANYING NOTES. THE ACCOUNTING

ESTIMATES THAT REQUIRE OUR MOST SIGNIFICANT, DIFFICULT, AND

SUBJECTIVE JUDGMENTS INCLUDE.



THE VALUATION OF NON-MARKETABLE

EQUITY INVESTMENTS AND THE DETERMINATION OF

OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY

IMPAIRMENTS;



THE ASSESSMENT OF RECOVERABILITY

OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS;



THE RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT OF

CURRENT AND DEFERRED INCOME TAXES (INCLUDING THE MEASUREMENT OF

UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS); AND



THE VALUATION OF INVENTORY.

THE ACTUAL RESULTS THAT WE

EXPERIENCE MAY DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM OUR ESTIMATES.

TRADING

ASSETS

MARKETABLE DEBT INSTRUMENTS ARE

DESIGNATED AS TRADING ASSETS WHEN THE INTEREST RATE OR FOREIGN

EXCHANGE RATE RISK IS HEDGED AT INCEPTION WITH A RELATED

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENT. INVESTMENTS DESIGNATED AS TRADING ASSETS

ARE REPORTED AT FAIR VALUE. THE GAINS OR LOSSES OF THESE

INVESTMENTS ARISING FROM CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE DUE TO INTEREST

RATE AND CURRENCY MARKET FLUCTUATIONS AND CREDIT MARKET

VOLATILITY, OFFSET BY LOSSES OR GAINS ON THE RELATED DERIVATIVE

INSTRUMENTS, ARE RECORDED IN INTEREST AND OTHER, NET. WE ALSO

DESIGNATE CERTAIN FLOATING-RATE SECURITIZED FINANCIAL

INSTRUMENTS, PRIMARILY ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES PURCHASED AFTER

DECEMBER 30, 2006, AS TRADING ASSETS.

DURING 2009, WE SOLD OUR EQUITY

SECURITIES OFFSETTING DEFERRED COMPENSATION AND ENTERED INTO

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS THAT SEEK TO OFFSET CHANGES IN

LIABILITIES RELATED TO THESE DEFERRED COMPENSATION ARRANGEMENTS.

GAINS OR LOSSES FROM CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE OF THESE EQUITY

SECURITIES WERE OFFSET AGAINST LOSSES OR GAINS ON THE RELATED

LIABILITIES AND INCLUDED IN INTEREST AND OTHER, NET. SEE

NOTE 8: DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS FOR FURTHER

INFORMATION ON OUR EQUITY MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT PROGRAMS.

AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE

CASH EQUIVALENTS.

AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE

DEBT INSTRUMENTS WITH ORIGINAL MATURITIES AT THE DATE OF

PURCHASE GREATER THAN APPROXIMATELY THREE MONTHS AND REMAINING

DERIVATIVE

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

OUR PRIMARY OBJECTIVE FOR HOLDING

DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS IS TO MANAGE CURRENCY EXCHANGE

RATE AND INTEREST RATE RISK, AND TO A LESSER EXTENT, EQUITY

MARKET AND COMMODITY PRICE RISK. OUR DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL

INSTRUMENTS ARE RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE AND ARE INCLUDED IN OTHER

CURRENT ASSETS, OTHER LONG-TERM ASSETS, OTHER ACCRUED

LIABILITIES, OR OTHER LONG-TERM LIABILITIES.

OUR ACCOUNTING POLICIES FOR

DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS ARE BASED ON WHETHER THEY MEET

THE CRITERIA FOR DESIGNATION AS CASH FLOW OR FAIR VALUE HEDGES.

A DESIGNATED HEDGE OF THE EXPOSURE TO VARIABILITY IN THE FUTURE

CASH FLOWS OF AN ASSET OR A LIABILITY, OR OF A FORECASTED

TRANSACTION, IS REFERRED TO AS A CASH FLOW HEDGE. A DESIGNATED

HEDGE OF THE EXPOSURE TO CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE OF AN ASSET OR A

LIABILITY, OR OF AN UNRECOGNIZED FIRM COMMITMENT, IS REFERRED TO

AS A FAIR VALUE HEDGE. THE CRITERIA FOR DESIGNATING A DERIVATIVE

AS A HEDGE INCLUDE THE ASSESSMENT OF THE INSTRUMENTS

EFFECTIVENESS IN RISK REDUCTION, MATCHING OF THE DERIVATIVE

INSTRUMENT TO ITS UNDERLYING TRANSACTION, AND THE ASSESSMENT OF

THE PROBABILITY THAT THE UNDERLYING TRANSACTION WILL OCCUR. FOR

DERIVATIVES WITH CASH FLOW HEDGE ACCOUNTING DESIGNATION, WE

REPORT THE AFTER-TAX GAIN OR LOSS FROM THE EFFECTIVE PORTION OF

THE HEDGE AS A COMPONENT OF ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE

INCOME (LOSS) AND RECLASSIFY IT INTO EARNINGS IN THE SAME PERIOD

OR PERIODS IN WHICH THE HEDGED TRANSACTION AFFECTS EARNINGS, AND

WITHIN THE SAME LINE ITEM ON THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF

OPERATIONS AS THE IMPACT OF THE HEDGED TRANSACTION. FOR

DERIVATIVES WITH FAIR VALUE HEDGE ACCOUNTING DESIGNATION, WE

RECOGNIZE GAINS OR LOSSES FROM THE CHANGE IN FAIR VALUE OF THESE

DERIVATIVES, AS WELL AS THE OFFSETTING CHANGE IN THE FAIR VALUE

OF THE UNDERLYING HEDGED ITEM, IN EARNINGS. DERIVATIVES THAT WE

DESIGNATE AS HEDGES ARE CLASSIFIED IN THE CONSOLIDATED

STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS IN THE SAME SECTION AS THE UNDERLYING

ITEM, PRIMARILY WITHIN CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES.

WE RECOGNIZE GAINS AND LOSSES FROM

CHANGES IN FAIR VALUES OF DERIVATIVES THAT ARE NOT DESIGNATED AS

HEDGES FOR ACCOUNTING PURPOSES WITHIN THE LINE ITEM ON THE

CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS MOST CLOSELY ASSOCIATED

WITH THE ECONOMIC UNDERLYING, PRIMARILY IN INTEREST AND OTHER,

NET. AS PART OF OUR STRATEGIC INVESTMENT PROGRAM, WE ALSO

ACQUIRE EQUITY DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS, SUCH AS WARRANTS AND

EQUITY CONVERSION RIGHTS ASSOCIATED WITH DEBT INSTRUMENTS, THAT

WE DO NOT DESIGNATE AS HEDGING INSTRUMENTS. WE RECOGNIZE THE

GAINS OR LOSSES FROM CHANGES IN FAIR VALUES OF THESE EQUITY

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS IN GAINS (LOSSES) ON OTHER EQUITY

INVESTMENTS, NET. GAINS AND LOSSES FROM DERIVATIVES NOT

DESIGNATED AS HEDGES ARE CLASSIFIED IN CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING

ACTIVITIES.

MEASUREMENT

OF EFFECTIVENESS



EFFECTIVENESS FOR FORWARDS

IS GENERALLY MEASURED

BY COMPARING THE CUMULATIVE CHANGE IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE

HEDGE CONTRACT WITH THE CUMULATIVE CHANGE IN THE PRESENT VALUE

OF THE FORECASTED CASH FLOWS OF THE HEDGED ITEM. FOR CURRENCY

FORWARD CONTRACTS USED IN CASH FLOW HEDGING STRATEGIES RELATED

TO CAPITAL PURCHASES, FORWARD POINTS ARE EXCLUDED, AND

EFFECTIVENESS IS MEASURED USING SPOT RATES TO VALUE BOTH THE

HEDGE CONTRACT AND THE HEDGED ITEM. FOR CURRENCY FORWARD

CONTRACTS USED IN CASH FLOW HEDGING STRATEGIES RELATED TO

OPERATING EXPENDITURES, FORWARD POINTS ARE INCLUDED AND

EFFECTIVENESS IS MEASURED USING FORWARD RATES TO VALUE BOTH THE

HEDGE CONTRACT AND THE HEDGED ITEM.



EFFECTIVENESS FOR CURRENCY

OPTIONS AND EQUITY OPTIONS WITH HEDGE ACCOUNTING DESIGNATION

IS GENERALLY MEASURED

BY COMPARING THE CUMULATIVE CHANGE IN THE INTRINSIC VALUE OF THE

HEDGE CONTRACT WITH THE CUMULATIVE CHANGE IN THE INTRINSIC VALUE

OF AN OPTION INSTRUMENT REPRESENTING THE HEDGED RISKS IN THE

HEDGED ITEM FOR CASH FLOW HEDGES. FOR CASH FLOW AND FAIR VALUE

HEDGES, TIME VALUE IS EXCLUDED AND EFFECTIVENESS IS MEASURED

BASED ON SPOT RATES TO VALUE BOTH THE HEDGE CONTRACT AND THE

HEDGED ITEM.



EFFECTIVENESS FOR INTEREST RATE

SWAPS AND COMMODITY SWAPS

IS GENERALLY MEASURED

BY COMPARING THE CHANGE IN FAIR VALUE OF THE HEDGED ITEM WITH

THE CHANGE IN FAIR VALUE OF THE SWAP.

IF A CASH FLOW HEDGE IS

DISCONTINUED BECAUSE IT IS NO LONGER PROBABLE THAT THE ORIGINAL

HEDGED TRANSACTION WILL OCCUR AS ANTICIPATED, THE UNREALIZED

GAIN OR LOSS ON THE RELATED DERIVATIVE IS RECLASSIFIED INTO

EARNINGS. SUBSEQUENT GAINS OR LOSSES ON THE RELATED DERIVATIVE

INSTRUMENT ARE RECOGNIZED IN INTEREST AND OTHER, NET IN EACH

PERIOD UNTIL THE INSTRUMENT MATURES, IS TERMINATED, IS

RE-DESIGNATED AS A QUALIFIED HEDGE, OR IS SOLD. INEFFECTIVE

PORTIONS OF CASH FLOW HEDGES AND FAIR VALUE HEDGES, AS WELL AS

AMOUNTS EXCLUDED FROM THE ASSESSMENT OF EFFECTIVENESS, ARE

RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS IN INTEREST AND OTHER, NET. FOR FURTHER

DISCUSSION OF OUR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS, SEE NOTE 8.

LOANS

RECEIVABLE

WE MAKE LOANS TO THIRD PARTIES

THAT ARE CLASSIFIED WITHIN OTHER CURRENT ASSETS OR OTHER

LONG-TERM ASSETS. WE MAY ELECT THE FAIR VALUE OPTION FOR LOANS

WHEN THE INTEREST RATE OR FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATE RISK IS HEDGED

AT INCEPTION WITH A RELATED DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENT. WE RECORD THE

GAINS OR LOSSES ON THESE LOANS ARISING FROM CHANGES IN FAIR

VALUE DUE TO INTEREST RATE, CURRENCY MARKET FLUCTUATIONS, AND

CREDIT MARKET VOLATILITY, OFFSET BY LOSSES OR GAINS ON THE

RELATED DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS, IN INTEREST AND OTHER, NET.

LOANS THAT ARE DENOMINATED IN U.S. DOLLARS AND HAVE A

FLOATING-RATE COUPON ARE CARRIED AT AMORTIZED COST. WE MEASURE

INTEREST INCOME FOR ALL LOANS RECEIVABLE USING THE INTEREST

METHOD, WHICH IS BASED ON THE EFFECTIVE YIELD OF THE LOANS

RATHER THAN THE STATED COUPON RATE.

GOODWILL

WE RECORD GOODWILL WHEN THE

PURCHASE PRICE OF AN ACQUISITION EXCEEDS THE FAIR VALUE OF THE

NET TANGIBLE AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS AS OF THE DATE OF

ACQUISITION. WE PERFORM A QUARTERLY REVIEW OF GOODWILL FOR

INDICATORS OF IMPAIRMENT. DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF EACH

YEAR, WE PERFORM AN IMPAIRMENT REVIEW FOR EACH REPORTING UNIT

USING A FAIR VALUE APPROACH. WE DO NOT IDENTIFY MANUFACTURING

AND ASSEMBLY AND TEST ASSETS WITH INDIVIDUAL REPORTING UNITS

BECAUSE OF THE INTERCHANGEABLE NATURE OF OUR MANUFACTURING AND

ASSEMBLY AND TEST ASSETS. IN DETERMINING THE CARRYING VALUE OF

THE REPORTING UNIT, WE MAKE AN ALLOCATION OF OUR MANUFACTURING

AND ASSEMBLY AND TEST ASSETS BASED ON EACH REPORTING UNITS

RELATIVE PERCENTAGE UTILIZATION OF THE MANUFACTURING AND

ASSEMBLY AND TEST ASSETS. FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION OF GOODWILL,

SEE NOTE 17: GOODWILL.

IDENTIFIED

INTANGIBLE ASSETS

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY ASSETS

PRIMARILY REPRESENT RIGHTS ACQUIRED UNDER TECHNOLOGY LICENSES

AND ARE GENERALLY AMORTIZED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THE

PERIODS OF BENEFIT, RANGING FROM 3 TO 17 YEARS. WE AMORTIZE

ACQUISITION-RELATED DEVELOPED TECHNOLOGY BASED ON ECONOMIC

BENEFIT OVER THE ESTIMATED USEFUL LIFE, RANGING FROM 4 TO 7

YEARS. WE AMORTIZE OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS OVER PERIODS RANGING

FROM 4 TO 7 YEARS. WE AMORTIZE ACQUISITION-RELATED IN-PROCESS

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT OVER THE ESTIMATED USEFUL LIFE ONCE THE

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS ARE COMPLETED. IN THE QUARTER

FOLLOWING THE PERIOD IN WHICH IDENTIFIED INTANGIBLE ASSETS

BECOME FULLY AMORTIZED, THE FULLY AMORTIZED BALANCES ARE REMOVED

FROM THE GROSS ASSET AND ACCUMULATED AMORTIZATION AMOUNTS.

WE PERFORM A QUARTERLY REVIEW OF

IDENTIFIED INTANGIBLE ASSETS TO DETERMINE IF FACTS AND

CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THAT THE USEFUL LIFE IS SHORTER THAN WE

HAD ORIGINALLY ESTIMATED OR THAT THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF ASSETS

MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE. IF SUCH FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES EXIST,

WE ASSESS THE RECOVERABILITY OF IDENTIFIED INTANGIBLE ASSETS BY

COMPARING THE PROJECTED UNDISCOUNTED NET CASH FLOWS ASSOCIATED

WITH THE RELATED ASSET OR GROUP OF ASSETS OVER THEIR REMAINING

LIVES AGAINST THEIR RESPECTIVE CARRYING AMOUNTS. IMPAIRMENTS, IF

ANY, ARE BASED ON THE EXCESS OF THE CARRYING AMOUNT OVER THE

FAIR VALUE OF THOSE ASSETS. IF THE USEFUL LIFE IS SHORTER THAN

ORIGINALLY ESTIMATED, WE ACCELERATE THE RATE OF AMORTIZATION AND

AMORTIZE THE REMAINING CARRYING VALUE OVER THE NEW SHORTER

USEFUL LIFE.

FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION OF

IDENTIFIED INTANGIBLE ASSETS, SEE NOTE 18: IDENTIFIED

INTANGIBLE ASSETS.

PRODUCT

WARRANTY

THE VAST MAJORITY OF OUR PRODUCTS

ARE SOLD WITH A LIMITED WARRANTY ON PRODUCT QUALITY AND A

LIMITED INDEMNIFICATION FOR CUSTOMERS AGAINST INTELLECTUAL

PROPERTY INFRINGEMENT CLAIMS RELATED TO OUR PRODUCTS. THE

ACCRUAL AND THE RELATED EXPENSE FOR KNOWN ISSUES WERE NOT

SIGNIFICANT DURING THE PERIODS PRESENTED. DUE TO PRODUCT

TESTING, THE SHORT TIME TYPICALLY BETWEEN PRODUCT SHIPMENT AND

THE DETECTION AND CORRECTION OF PRODUCT FAILURES, AND THE

HISTORICAL RATE OF PAYMENTS ON INDEMNIFICATION CLAIMS, THE

ACCRUAL AND RELATED EXPENSE FOR ESTIMATED INCURRED BUT

UNIDENTIFIED ISSUES WERE NOT SIGNIFICANT DURING THE PERIODS

PRESENTED.

REVENUE

RECOGNITION

WE RECOGNIZE NET PRODUCT REVENUE

WHEN THE EARNINGS PROCESS IS COMPLETE, AS EVIDENCED BY AN

AGREEMENT WITH THE CUSTOMER, TRANSFER OF TITLE, AND ACCEPTANCE,

IF APPLICABLE, AS WELL AS FIXED PRICING AND PROBABLE

COLLECTABILITY. WE RECORD PRICING ALLOWANCES, INCLUDING

DISCOUNTS BASED ON CONTRACTUAL ARRANGEMENTS WITH CUSTOMERS, WHEN

WE RECOGNIZE REVENUE AS A REDUCTION TO BOTH ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE

AND NET REVENUE. BECAUSE OF FREQUENT SALES PRICE REDUCTIONS AND

RAPID TECHNOLOGY OBSOLESCENCE IN THE INDUSTRY, WE DEFER PRODUCT

REVENUE AND RELATED COSTS OF SALES FROM SALES MADE TO

DISTRIBUTORS UNDER AGREEMENTS ALLOWING PRICE PROTECTION

AND/OR

RIGHT

OF RETURN UNTIL THE DISTRIBUTORS SELL THE MERCHANDISE. THE RIGHT

OF RETURN GRANTED GENERALLY CONSISTS OF A STOCK ROTATION PROGRAM

IN WHICH DISTRIBUTORS ARE ABLE TO EXCHANGE CERTAIN PRODUCTS

BASED ON THE NUMBER OF QUALIFIED PURCHASES MADE BY THE

DISTRIBUTOR. UNDER THE PRICE PROTECTION PROGRAM, WE GIVE

DISTRIBUTORS CREDITS FOR THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE ORIGINAL

PRICE PAID AND THE CURRENT PRICE THAT WE OFFER. WE RECORD THE

NET DEFERRED INCOME FROM PRODUCT SALES TO DISTRIBUTORS ON OUR

BALANCE SHEET AS DEFERRED INCOME ON SHIPMENTS TO DISTRIBUTORS.

WE INCLUDE SHIPPING CHARGES BILLED TO CUSTOMERS IN NET REVENUE,

AND INCLUDE THE RELATED SHIPPING COSTS IN COST OF SALES.

SALES OF SOFTWARE, PRIMARILY

THROUGH OUR WIND RIVER SOFTWARE GROUP, ARE MADE THROUGH TERM

LICENSES THAT ARE GENERALLY 12 MONTHS IN LENGTH, OR PERPETUAL

LICENSES. REVENUE IS GENERALLY RECOGNIZED RATABLY OVER THE

ADVERTISING COSTS AS MARKETING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE

EXPENSES TO THE EXTENT THAT AN ADVERTISING BENEFIT SEPARATE FROM

THE REVENUE TRANSACTION CAN BE IDENTIFIED AND THE FAIR VALUE OF

THAT ADVERTISING BENEFIT RECEIVED IS DETERMINABLE. WE RECORD ANY

EXCESS IN CASH PAID OVER THE FAIR VALUE OF THE ADVERTISING

INCLUDING DIRECT MARKETING COSTS, RECORDED WITHIN MARKETING,

GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES WERE $1.39 BILLION IN 2009

ATTRIBUTION METHOD TO RECOGNIZE SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION OVER

THE SERVICE PERIOD OF THE AWARD. UPON EXERCISE, CANCELLATION,

FORFEITURE, OR EXPIRATION OF STOCK OPTIONS, OR UPON VESTING OR

FORFEITURE OF RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS, WE ELIMINATE DEFERRED TAX

ASSETS FOR OPTIONS AND RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS WITH MULTIPLE

NOTE 3.

ACCOUNTING CHANGES

2007

IN 2007, WE ADOPTED STANDARDS THAT

REQUIRED COMPANIES TO ACCRUE THE COST OF COMPENSATED ABSENCES

FOR SABBATICAL LEAVE OVER THE SERVICE PERIOD. WE ADOPTED THESE

STANDARDS THROUGH A CUMULATIVE-EFFECT ADJUSTMENT AT THE

BEGINNING OF 2007, RESULTING IN AN ADDITIONAL LIABILITY OF $280

MILLION, ADDITIONAL DEFERRED TAX ASSETS OF $99 MILLION, AND A

REDUCTION TO RETAINED EARNINGS OF $181 MILLION. WE ALSO ADOPTED

STANDARDS THAT CHANGED THE ACCOUNTING FOR UNCERTAIN TAX

POSITIONS. FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION, SEE NOTE 27.

TAXES.

2008

IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2008, WE

ADOPTED NEW STANDARDS FOR FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS FOR ALL

FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES RECOGNIZED OR DISCLOSED AT FAIR

VALUE IN THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ON A RECURRING

BASIS (AT LEAST ANNUALLY). THE STANDARDS DEFINED FAIR VALUE,

ESTABLISHED A FRAMEWORK FOR MEASURING FAIR VALUE, AND ENHANCED

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT DISCLOSURES. THE ADOPTION OF THESE NEW

STANDARDS DID NOT HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON OUR CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, AND THE RESULTING FAIR VALUES CALCULATED

AFTER ADOPTION WERE NOT SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT FROM THE FAIR

VALUES THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN CALCULATED UNDER PREVIOUS GUIDANCE.

AS DISCUSSED BELOW, WE ADOPTED THE FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT

STANDARDS FOR OUR NON-FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES IN THE

FIRST QUARTER OF 2009. FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION OF OUR FAIR VALUE

MEASUREMENTS, SEE NOTE 5: FAIR VALUE.

IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2008, WE

ADOPTED NEW STANDARDS THAT CLARIFIED THE APPLICATION OF FAIR

VALUE IN A MARKET THAT IS NOT ACTIVE, AND ADDRESSED APPLICATION

ISSUES SUCH AS THE USE OF INTERNAL ASSUMPTIONS WHEN RELEVANT

OBSERVABLE DATA DOES NOT EXIST, THE USE OF OBSERVABLE MARKET

INFORMATION WHEN THE MARKET IS NOT ACTIVE, AND THE USE OF MARKET

QUOTES WHEN ASSESSING THE RELEVANCE OF OBSERVABLE AND

UNOBSERVABLE DATA. THE ADOPTION OF THESE NEW STANDARDS DID NOT

HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS OR THE FAIR VALUES OF OUR FINANCIAL ASSETS AND

LIABILITIES.

(CONTINUED)

IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2008, WE

ADOPTED NEW STANDARDS THAT PERMITTED COMPANIES TO CHOOSE TO

MEASURE CERTAIN FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND OTHER ITEMS AT FAIR

VALUE USING AN

INSTRUMENT-BY-INSTRUMENT

ELECTION. THE NEW STANDARDS REQUIRED UNREALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES

TO BE REPORTED IN EARNINGS FOR ITEMS MEASURED USING THE FAIR

VALUE OPTION. FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION, SEE NOTE 5: FAIR

VALUE. THESE NEW STANDARDS ALSO REQUIRED CASH FLOWS FROM

PURCHASES, SALES, AND MATURITIES OF TRADING SECURITIES TO BE

CLASSIFIED BASED ON THE NATURE AND PURPOSE FOR WHICH THE

SECURITIES WERE ACQUIRED. WE ASSESSED THE NATURE AND PURPOSE OF

OUR TRADING ASSETS AND DETERMINED THAT OUR MARKETABLE DEBT

INSTRUMENTS WILL BE CLASSIFIED ON THE STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS AS

INVESTING ACTIVITIES, AS THEY ARE HELD WITH THE PURPOSE OF

GENERATING RETURNS. ACTIVITY RELATED TO EQUITY SECURITIES

OFFSETTING DEFERRED COMPENSATION REMAINED CLASSIFIED AS

OPERATING ACTIVITIES, AS THEY WERE MAINTAINED TO OFFSET CHANGES

IN LIABILITIES RELATED TO THE EQUITY MARKET RISK OF CERTAIN

DEFERRED COMPENSATION ARRANGEMENTS. THESE STANDARDS DID NOT

ALLOW FOR RETROSPECTIVE APPLICATION TO PERIODS PRIOR TO 2008;

THEREFORE, ALL TRADING ASSET ACTIVITY FOR PRIOR PERIODS WILL

CONTINUE TO BE PRESENTED AS OPERATING ACTIVITIES ON THE

STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS.

IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2008,

AMENDED VIEWS OF THE U.S. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

(SEC) ON THE USE OF THE SIMPLIFIED METHOD IN DEVELOPING

ESTIMATES OF THE EXPECTED LIVES OF SHARE OPTIONS BECAME

EFFECTIVE FOR US. THE AMENDMENT, IN PART, ALLOWED THE CONTINUED

USE, SUBJECT TO SPECIFIC CRITERIA, OF THE SIMPLIFIED METHOD IN

ESTIMATING THE EXPECTED LIVES OF SHARE OPTIONS GRANTED AFTER

DECEMBER 31, 2007. WE WILL CONTINUE TO USE THE SIMPLIFIED METHOD

UNTIL WE HAVE THE HISTORICAL DATA NECESSARY TO PROVIDE

REASONABLE ESTIMATES OF EXPECTED LIVES.

2009

IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2009, WE

ADOPTED NEW STANDARDS THAT CHANGED THE ACCOUNTING FOR

CONVERTIBLE DEBT INSTRUMENTS WITH CASH SETTLEMENT FEATURES. AS

OF ADOPTION, THESE NEW STANDARDS APPLIED TO OUR JUNIOR

SUBORDINATED CONVERTIBLE DEBENTURES ISSUED IN 2005 (THE 2005

DEBENTURES). UNDER THE PREVIOUS STANDARDS, OUR 2005 DEBENTURES

WERE RECOGNIZED ENTIRELY AS A LIABILITY AT HISTORICAL VALUE. IN

ACCORDANCE WITH ADOPTING THESE NEW STANDARDS, WE RETROSPECTIVELY

RECOGNIZED BOTH A LIABILITY AND AN EQUITY COMPONENT OF THE 2005

DEBENTURES AT FAIR VALUE. THE LIABILITY COMPONENT IS RECOGNIZED

AS THE FAIR VALUE OF A SIMILAR INSTRUMENT THAT DOES NOT HAVE A

CONVERSION FEATURE AT ISSUANCE. THE EQUITY COMPONENT, WHICH IS

THE VALUE OF THE CONVERSION FEATURE AT ISSUANCE, IS RECOGNIZED

AS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE PROCEEDS FROM THE ISSUANCE OF THE

2005 DEBENTURES AND THE FAIR VALUE OF THE LIABILITY COMPONENT,

AFTER ADJUSTING FOR THE DEFERRED TAX IMPACT. THE 2005 DEBENTURES

WERE ISSUED AT A COUPON RATE OF 2.95%, WHICH WAS BELOW THAT OF A

SIMILAR INSTRUMENT THAT DID NOT HAVE A CONVERSION FEATURE

(6.45%). THEREFORE, THE VALUATION OF THE DEBT COMPONENT, USING

THE INCOME APPROACH, RESULTED IN A DEBT DISCOUNT. THE DEBT

DISCOUNT IS REDUCED OVER THE EXPECTED LIFE OF THE DEBT, WHICH IS

ALSO THE STATED LIFE OF THE DEBT. THESE NEW STANDARDS ARE ALSO

APPLICABLE IN ACCOUNTING FOR OUR CONVERTIBLE DEBT ISSUED DURING

2009. SEE NOTE 20: BORROWINGS FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION.

AS A RESULT OF APPLYING THESE NEW

STANDARDS RETROSPECTIVELY TO ALL PERIODS PRESENTED, WE

RECOGNIZED THE FOLLOWING INCREMENTAL EFFECTS ON INDIVIDUAL LINE

IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2009, WE

ADOPTED REVISED STANDARDS FOR BUSINESS COMBINATIONS. THESE

REVISED STANDARDS GENERALLY REQUIRE AN ENTITY TO RECOGNIZE THE

ASSETS, LIABILITIES, CONTINGENCIES, AND CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION

AT THEIR FAIR VALUE ON THE ACQUISITION DATE. FOR CIRCUMSTANCES

IN WHICH THE ACQUISITION-DATE FAIR VALUE FOR A CONTINGENCY

CANNOT BE DETERMINED DURING THE MEASUREMENT PERIOD AND IT IS

CONCLUDED THAT IT IS PROBABLE THAT AN ASSET OR LIABILITY EXISTS

AS OF THE ACQUISITION DATE AND THE AMOUNT CAN BE REASONABLY

ESTIMATED, A CONTINGENCY IS RECOGNIZED AS OF THE ACQUISITION

DATE BASED ON THE ESTIMATED AMOUNT. IT FURTHER REQUIRES THAT

ACQUISITION-RELATED COSTS BE RECOGNIZED SEPARATELY FROM THE

ACQUISITION AND EXPENSED AS INCURRED, RESTRUCTURING COSTS

GENERALLY BE EXPENSED IN PERIODS SUBSEQUENT TO THE ACQUISITION

DATE, AND CHANGES IN ESTIMATES FOR ACCOUNTING OF DEFERRED TAX

ASSET VALUATION ALLOWANCES AND ACQUIRED INCOME TAX UNCERTAINTIES

THESE NEW STANDARDS BECAME APPLICABLE TO BUSINESS COMBINATIONS

ON A PROSPECTIVE BASIS BEGINNING IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2009.

OUR ACQUISITIONS COMPLETED DURING 2009 HAVE BEEN ACCOUNTED FOR

USING THESE REVISED STANDARDS. SEE NOTE 15.

ACQUISITIONS.

IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2009, WE

ADOPTED NEW STANDARDS THAT SPECIFY THE WAY IN WHICH FAIR VALUE

MEASUREMENTS SHOULD BE MADE FOR

NON-FINANCIAL

ASSETS AND NON-FINANCIAL LIABILITIES THAT ARE NOT MEASURED AND

RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE ON A RECURRING BASIS, AND SPECIFY

ADDITIONAL DISCLOSURES RELATED TO THESE FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS.

THE ADOPTION OF THESE NEW STANDARDS DID NOT HAVE A SIGNIFICANT

IMPACT ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2009, WE

ADOPTED NEW STANDARDS THAT PROVIDE GUIDANCE ON HOW TO DETERMINE

THE FAIR VALUE OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES WHEN THE VOLUME AND

LEVEL OF ACTIVITY FOR THE ASSET/LIABILITY HAVE SIGNIFICANTLY

DECREASED. THESE NEW STANDARDS ALSO PROVIDE GUIDANCE ON

IDENTIFYING CIRCUMSTANCES THAT INDICATE A TRANSACTION IS NOT

ORDERLY. IN ADDITION, WE ARE REQUIRED TO DISCLOSE IN INTERIM AND

ANNUAL PERIODS THE INPUTS AND VALUATION TECHNIQUES USED TO

MEASURE FAIR VALUE AND A DISCUSSION OF CHANGES IN VALUATION

TECHNIQUES. THE ADOPTION OF THESE NEW STANDARDS DID NOT HAVE A

SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2009, WE

ADOPTED NEW STANDARDS FOR THE RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT OF

OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY

IMPAIRMENTS FOR DEBT SECURITIES THAT REPLACED THE PRE-EXISTING

INTENT AND ABILITY INDICATOR. THESE NEW STANDARDS

SPECIFY THAT IF THE FAIR VALUE OF A DEBT SECURITY IS LESS THAN

ITS AMORTIZED COST BASIS, AN

OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY

IMPAIRMENT IS TRIGGERED IN CIRCUMSTANCES IN WHICH (1) AN ENTITY

HAS AN INTENT TO SELL THE SECURITY, (2) IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN

NOT THAT THE ENTITY WILL BE REQUIRED TO SELL THE SECURITY BEFORE

RECOVERY OF ITS AMORTIZED COST BASIS, OR (3) THE ENTITY DOES NOT

EXPECT TO RECOVER THE ENTIRE AMORTIZED COST BASIS OF THE

SECURITY (THAT IS, A CREDIT LOSS EXISTS).

OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY

IMPAIRMENTS ARE SEPARATED INTO AMOUNTS REPRESENTING CREDIT

LOSSES, WHICH ARE RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS, AND AMOUNTS RELATED TO

ALL OTHER FACTORS, WHICH ARE RECOGNIZED IN OTHER COMPREHENSIVE

INCOME (LOSS). THE ADOPTION OF THESE NEW STANDARDS DID NOT HAVE

A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

SEE NOTE 7.

AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE

INVESTMENTS FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION.

IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2009, WE

ADOPTED AMENDED STANDARDS FOR THE FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT OF

LIABILITIES. THESE AMENDED STANDARDS CLARIFY THAT IN

CIRCUMSTANCES IN WHICH A QUOTED PRICE IN AN ACTIVE MARKET FOR

THE IDENTICAL LIABILITY IS NOT AVAILABLE, WE ARE REQUIRED TO USE

THE QUOTED PRICE OF THE IDENTICAL LIABILITY WHEN TRADED AS AN

ASSET, QUOTED PRICES FOR SIMILAR LIABILITIES, OR QUOTED PRICES

FOR SIMILAR LIABILITIES WHEN TRADED AS ASSETS. IF THESE QUOTED

PRICES ARE NOT AVAILABLE, WE ARE REQUIRED TO USE ANOTHER

VALUATION TECHNIQUE, SUCH AS AN INCOME APPROACH OR A MARKET

APPROACH. THESE AMENDED STANDARDS BECAME EFFECTIVE FOR US

BEGINNING IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2009 AND DID NOT HAVE A

SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

NOTE 4.

RECENT ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

IN JUNE 2009, THE FINANCIAL

ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD (FASB) ISSUED NEW STANDARDS FOR THE

ACCOUNTING FOR TRANSFERS OF FINANCIAL ASSETS. THESE NEW

STANDARDS ELIMINATE THE CONCEPT OF A QUALIFYING SPECIAL-PURPOSE

ENTITY; REMOVE THE SCOPE EXCEPTION FROM APPLYING THE ACCOUNTING

STANDARDS THAT ADDRESS THE CONSOLIDATION OF VARIABLE INTEREST

ENTITIES TO QUALIFYING

SPECIAL-PURPOSE

ENTITIES; CHANGE THE STANDARDS FOR

DE-RECOGNIZING

FINANCIAL ASSETS; AND REQUIRE ENHANCED DISCLOSURE. THESE NEW

STANDARDS ARE EFFECTIVE FOR US BEGINNING IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF

2010, AND ARE NOT EXPECTED TO HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON OUR

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

IN JUNE 2009, THE FASB ISSUED

AMENDED STANDARDS FOR DETERMINING WHETHER TO CONSOLIDATE A

VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITY. THESE AMENDED STANDARDS ELIMINATE A

MANDATORY QUANTITATIVE APPROACH TO DETERMINE WHETHER A VARIABLE

INTEREST GIVES THE ENTITY A CONTROLLING FINANCIAL INTEREST IN A

VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITY IN FAVOR OF A QUALITATIVELY FOCUSED

ANALYSIS, AND REQUIRE AN ONGOING REASSESSMENT OF WHETHER AN

ENTITY IS THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY. THESE AMENDED STANDARDS ARE

EFFECTIVE FOR US BEGINNING IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2010 AND ARE

NOT EXPECTED TO HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON OUR CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

IN OCTOBER 2009, THE FASB ISSUED

NEW STANDARDS FOR REVENUE RECOGNITION WITH MULTIPLE

DELIVERABLES. THESE NEW STANDARDS IMPACT THE DETERMINATION OF

WHEN THE INDIVIDUAL DELIVERABLES INCLUDED IN A MULTIPLE-ELEMENT

ARRANGEMENT MAY BE TREATED AS SEPARATE UNITS OF ACCOUNTING.

ADDITIONALLY, THESE NEW STANDARDS MODIFY THE MANNER IN WHICH THE

TRANSACTION CONSIDERATION IS ALLOCATED ACROSS THE SEPARATELY

IDENTIFIED DELIVERABLES BY NO LONGER PERMITTING THE RESIDUAL

METHOD OF ALLOCATING ARRANGEMENT CONSIDERATION. THESE NEW

STANDARDS ARE REQUIRED TO BE ADOPTED IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF

2011; HOWEVER, EARLY ADOPTION IS PERMITTED. WE DO NOT EXPECT

THESE NEW STANDARDS TO SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT OUR CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

IN OCTOBER 2009, THE FASB ISSUED

NEW STANDARDS FOR THE ACCOUNTING FOR CERTAIN REVENUE

ARRANGEMENTS THAT INCLUDE SOFTWARE ELEMENTS. THESE NEW STANDARDS

AMEND THE SCOPE OF PRE-EXISTING SOFTWARE REVENUE GUIDANCE BY

REMOVING FROM THE GUIDANCE NON-SOFTWARE COMPONENTS OF TANGIBLE

PRODUCTS AND CERTAIN SOFTWARE COMPONENTS OF TANGIBLE PRODUCTS.

THESE NEW STANDARDS ARE REQUIRED TO BE ADOPTED IN THE FIRST

QUARTER OF 2011; HOWEVER, EARLY ADOPTION IS PERMITTED. WE DO NOT

EXPECT THESE NEW STANDARDS TO SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT OUR

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

IN JANUARY 2010, THE FASB ISSUED

AMENDED STANDARDS THAT REQUIRE ADDITIONAL FAIR VALUE

DISCLOSURES. THESE AMENDED STANDARDS REQUIRE DISCLOSURES ABOUT

INPUTS AND VALUATION TECHNIQUES USED TO MEASURE FAIR VALUE AS

WELL AS DISCLOSURES ABOUT SIGNIFICANT TRANSFERS, BEGINNING IN

THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2010. ADDITIONALLY, THESE AMENDED STANDARDS

REQUIRE PRESENTATION OF DISAGGREGATED ACTIVITY WITHIN THE

RECONCILIATION FOR FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS USING SIGNIFICANT

UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS (LEVEL 3), BEGINNING IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF

2011. WE DO NOT EXPECT THESE NEW STANDARDS TO SIGNIFICANTLY

IMPACT OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

NOTE 5.

FAIR VALUE

FAIR VALUE IS THE PRICE THAT WOULD

BE RECEIVED FROM SELLING AN ASSET OR PAID TO TRANSFER A

LIABILITY IN AN ORDERLY TRANSACTION BETWEEN MARKET PARTICIPANTS

AT THE MEASUREMENT DATE. WHEN DETERMINING FAIR VALUE, WE

CONSIDER THE PRINCIPAL OR MOST ADVANTAGEOUS MARKET IN WHICH WE

WOULD TRANSACT, AND WE CONSIDER ASSUMPTIONS THAT MARKET

PARTICIPANTS WOULD USE WHEN PRICING THE ASSET OR LIABILITY. OUR

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS ARE MEASURED AND RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE,

EXCEPT FOR EQUITY METHOD INVESTMENTS, COST METHOD INVESTMENTS,

COST METHOD LOANS RECEIVABLE, AND MOST OF OUR LIABILITIES.

FAIR

VALUE HIERARCHY

THE THREE LEVELS OF INPUTS THAT

MAY BE USED TO MEASURE FAIR VALUE ARE AS FOLLOWS.

LEVEL

1.

QUOTED PRICES

IN ACTIVE MARKETS FOR IDENTICAL ASSETS OR LIABILITIES.

LEVEL

2.

OBSERVABLE

INPUTS OTHER THAN LEVEL 1 PRICES, SUCH AS QUOTED PRICES FOR

SIMILAR ASSETS OR LIABILITIES, QUOTED PRICES IN MARKETS WITH

INSUFFICIENT VOLUME OR INFREQUENT TRANSACTIONS (LESS ACTIVE

MARKETS), OR MODEL-DERIVED VALUATIONS IN WHICH ALL SIGNIFICANT

INPUTS ARE OBSERVABLE OR CAN BE DERIVED PRINCIPALLY FROM OR

CORROBORATED WITH OBSERVABLE MARKET DATA FOR SUBSTANTIALLY THE

FULL TERM OF THE ASSETS OR LIABILITIES. LEVEL 2 INPUTS ALSO

INCLUDE NON-BINDING MARKET CONSENSUS PRICES THAT CAN BE

CORROBORATED WITH OBSERVABLE MARKET DATA, AS WELL AS QUOTED

PRICES THAT WERE ADJUSTED FOR SECURITY-SPECIFIC RESTRICTIONS.

LEVEL

3.

UNOBSERVABLE

INPUTS TO THE VALUATION METHODOLOGY THAT ARE SIGNIFICANT TO THE

MEASUREMENT OF THE FAIR VALUE OF ASSETS OR LIABILITIES. LEVEL 3

INPUTS ALSO INCLUDE NON-BINDING MARKET CONSENSUS PRICES OR

NON-BINDING BROKER QUOTES THAT WE WERE UNABLE TO CORROBORATE

WITH OBSERVABLE MARKET DATA.

FAIR

VALUE OPTION FOR FINANCIAL ASSETS/LIABILITIES

UNDER ACCOUNTING STANDARDS ISSUED

IN 2008, ALL OF OUR NON-CONVERTIBLE LONG-TERM DEBT WAS ELIGIBLE

TO BE ACCOUNTED FOR AT FAIR VALUE. HOWEVER, WE ELECTED THIS FAIR

VALUE OPTION ONLY FOR THE BONDS ISSUED IN 2007 BY THE INDUSTRIAL

DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY OF THE CITY OF CHANDLER, ARIZONA (2007

ARIZONA BONDS). IN CONNECTION WITH THE 2007 ARIZONA BONDS, WE

ENTERED INTO A TOTAL RETURN SWAP AGREEMENT THAT EFFECTIVELY

CONVERTS THE FIXED RATE OBLIGATION ON THE BONDS TO A FLOATING

U.S.-DOLLAR

LIBOR-BASED RATE. AS A RESULT, CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THIS

DEBT ARE LARGELY OFFSET BY CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE

TOTAL RETURN SWAP AGREEMENT, WITHOUT THE NEED TO APPLY HEDGE

ACCOUNTING PROVISIONS. WE DID NOT ELECT THIS FAIR VALUE OPTION

FOR OUR ARIZONA BONDS ISSUED IN 2005, SINCE THE BONDS WERE

CARRIED AT AMORTIZED COST AND WERE NOT ELIGIBLE TO APPLY HEDGE

ACCOUNTING PROVISIONS DUE TO THE USE OF NON-DERIVATIVE HEDGING

INSTRUMENTS. THE 2007 ARIZONA BONDS ARE INCLUDED WITHIN THE

LONG-TERM DEBT BALANCE ON OUR CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS. AS OF

DECEMBER 26, 2009 AND DECEMBER 27, 2008, NO OTHER INSTRUMENTS

WERE SIMILAR TO THE LONG-TERM DEBT INSTRUMENT FOR WHICH WE

ELECTED FAIR VALUE TREATMENT.

THE FAIR VALUE OF THE 2007 ARIZONA

BONDS APPROXIMATED CARRYING VALUE AT THE TIME THAT WE ELECTED

THE FAIR VALUE OPTION; THEREFORE, WE DID NOT RECORD A

CUMULATIVE-EFFECT ADJUSTMENT TO THE BEGINNING BALANCE OF

RETAINED EARNINGS OR TO THE DEFERRED TAX LIABILITY. AS OF

DECEMBER 26, 2009, THE FAIR VALUE OF THE 2007 ARIZONA BONDS DID

NOT SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFER FROM THE CONTRACTUAL PRINCIPAL BALANCE.

THE FAIR VALUE OF THE 2007 ARIZONA BONDS WAS DETERMINED USING

INPUTS THAT ARE OBSERVABLE IN THE MARKET OR THAT CAN BE DERIVED

FROM OR CORROBORATED WITH OBSERVABLE MARKET DATA, AS WELL AS

UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS THAT WERE SIGNIFICANT TO THE FAIR VALUE.

GAINS AND LOSSES ON THE 2007 ARIZONA BONDS ARE RECORDED IN

INTEREST AND OTHER, NET ON THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF

OPERATIONS. WE CAPITALIZE INTEREST ASSOCIATED WITH THE 2007

ARIZONA BONDS. WE ADD CAPITALIZED INTEREST TO THE COST OF

QUALIFIED ASSETS AND AMORTIZE IT OVER THE ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES

OF THE ASSETS.

WE ELECTED THE FAIR VALUE OPTION

FOR LOANS MADE IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2009. THESE LOANS

RECEIVABLE ARE DENOMINATED IN EUROS AND MATURE IN 2012 AND 2013.

IN CONNECTION WITH THESE LOANS RECEIVABLE, WE ENTERED INTO A

CURRENCY INTEREST RATE SWAP AGREEMENT THAT EFFECTIVELY CONVERTS

THE EURO-DENOMINATED FIXED-RATE LOANS RECEIVABLE TO A FLOATING

U.S.-DOLLAR

LIBOR-BASED RATE. AS A RESULT, CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE ARE

LARGELY OFFSET BY CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE CURRENCY

INTEREST RATE SWAP AGREEMENT, WITHOUT THE NEED TO APPLY HEDGE

ACCOUNTING PROVISIONS. WE MADE A LOAN IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF

2009 THAT IS DENOMINATED IN U.S. DOLLARS AND HAS A FLOATING-RATE

COUPON. SINCE THE LOAN MATCHED OUR INVESTMENT OBJECTIVES, WE DID

NOT ENTER INTO ANY DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND DID NOT ELECT THE

FAIR VALUE OPTION FOR THE LOAN.

AS OF DECEMBER 26, 2009, THE FAIR

VALUE OF OUR LOANS RECEIVABLE FOR WHICH WE ELECTED THE FAIR

VALUE OPTION DID NOT SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFER FROM THE CONTRACTUAL

PRINCIPAL BALANCE. THESE LOANS RECEIVABLE ARE CLASSIFIED WITHIN

OTHER LONG-TERM ASSETS. FAIR VALUE IS DETERMINED USING A

DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW MODEL WITH ALL SIGNIFICANT INPUTS DERIVED

FROM OR CORROBORATED WITH OBSERVABLE MARKET DATA. GAINS AND

LOSSES FROM CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE, AS WELL AS INTEREST INCOME,

ARE RECORDED IN INTEREST AND OTHER, NET ON THE CONSOLIDATED

STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS. DURING 2009, GAINS FROM FAIR VALUE

CHANGES OF OUR LOANS RECEIVABLE WERE LARGELY OFFSET BY LOSSES

FROM FAIR VALUE CHANGES OF THE CURRENCY INTEREST RATE SWAP,

RESULTING IN A NEGLIGIBLE NET IMPACT ON OUR CONSOLIDATED

STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS. GAINS AND LOSSES ATTRIBUTABLE TO

CHANGES IN CREDIT RISK ARE DETERMINED USING OBSERVABLE CREDIT

DEFAULT SPREADS FOR COMPARABLE COMPANIES AND WERE INSIGNIFICANT

DURING 2009.

THE CARRYING VALUE OF OUR IMPAIRED

A PORTION OF OUR NON-MARKETABLE

2009 AND 2008 DUE TO EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES THAT SIGNIFICANTLY

IMPACTED THE FAIR VALUE OF THOSE INVESTMENTS, RESULTING IN

OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY

IMPAIRMENT CHARGES.

DURING 2008, WE RECORDED A $762

MILLION IMPAIRMENT CHARGE ON OUR INVESTMENT IN CLEARWIRE

COMMUNICATIONS, LLC (CLEARWIRE LLC) TO WRITE DOWN OUR INVESTMENT

TO ITS FAIR VALUE, PRIMARILY DUE TO THE FAIR VALUE BEING

SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER THAN THE COST BASIS OF OUR INVESTMENT. THE

IMPAIRMENT CHARGE WAS INCLUDED IN GAINS (LOSSES) ON EQUITY

METHOD INVESTMENTS, NET. WE DETERMINE THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR

INVESTMENT IN CLEARWIRE LLC PRIMARILY USING THE QUOTED PRICES

FOR ITS PARENT COMPANY, CLEARWIRE CORPORATION. THE EFFECTS OF

ADJUSTING THE QUOTED PRICE FOR PREMIUMS THAT WE BELIEVE MARKET

PARTICIPANTS WOULD CONSIDER FOR CLEARWIRE LLC, SUCH AS TAX

BENEFITS AND VOTING RIGHTS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR INVESTMENTS, WERE

MOSTLY OFFSET BY THE EFFECTS OF DISCOUNTS TO THE FAIR VALUE,

SUCH AS THOSE DUE TO TRANSFER RESTRICTIONS, LACK OF LIQUIDITY,

AND DIFFERENCES IN DIVIDEND RIGHTS THAT ARE INCLUDED IN THE

VALUE OF CLEARWIRE CORPORATION STOCK. WE CLASSIFIED OUR

INVESTMENT IN CLEARWIRE LLC AS LEVEL 2, AS THE UNOBSERVABLE

INPUTS TO THE VALUATION METHODOLOGY WERE NOT SIGNIFICANT TO THE

MEASUREMENT OF FAIR VALUE. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT

(CONTINUED)

WE RECORDED A $250 MILLION

IMPAIRMENT CHARGE ON OUR INVESTMENT IN NUMONYX B.V. DURING 2008

TO WRITE DOWN OUR INVESTMENT TO ITS FAIR VALUE. ESTIMATES FOR

REVENUE, EARNINGS, AND FUTURE CASH FLOWS WERE REVISED LOWER DUE

TO A GENERAL DECLINE IN THE NOR FLASH MEMORY MARKET SEGMENT IN

2008. WE MEASURED THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR INVESTMENT IN NUMONYX

USING A COMBINATION OF THE INCOME APPROACH AND THE MARKET

APPROACH. THE INCOME APPROACH INCLUDED THE USE OF A WEIGHTED

AVERAGE OF MULTIPLE DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW SCENARIOS OF NUMONYX,

WHICH REQUIRED THE USE OF UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS, INCLUDING

ASSUMPTIONS OF PROJECTED REVENUE, EXPENSES, CAPITAL SPENDING,

AND OTHER COSTS, AS WELL AS A DISCOUNT RATE CALCULATED BASED ON

THE RISK PROFILE OF THE FLASH MEMORY MARKET SEGMENT COMPARABLE

TO OUR INVESTMENT IN NUMONYX. THE MARKET APPROACH INCLUDED THE

USE OF FINANCIAL METRICS AND RATIOS, SUCH AS MULTIPLES OF

REVENUE AND EARNINGS OF COMPARABLE PUBLIC COMPANIES. THE

IMPAIRMENT CHARGE WAS INCLUDED IN GAINS (LOSSES) ON EQUITY

METHOD INVESTMENTS, NET ON THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF

OPERATIONS.

WE ALSO MEASURED AND RECORDED

OTHER NON-MARKETABLE EQUITY INVESTMENTS AT FAIR VALUE DURING

2009 AND 2008 WHEN WE RECOGNIZED

OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY

IMPAIRMENT CHARGES. WE CLASSIFIED THESE MEASUREMENTS AS LEVEL 3,

AS WE USED UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS TO THE VALUATION METHODOLOGIES

THAT WERE SIGNIFICANT TO THE FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS, AND THE

VALUATIONS REQUIRED MANAGEMENT JUDGMENT DUE TO THE ABSENCE OF

QUOTED MARKET PRICES. WE CALCULATED THESE FAIR VALUE

MEASUREMENTS USING THE MARKET AND INCOME APPROACHES. THE MARKET

APPROACH INCLUDES THE USE OF FINANCIAL METRICS AND RATIOS OF

COMPARABLE PUBLIC COMPANIES. THE SELECTION OF COMPARABLE

COMPANIES REQUIRES MANAGEMENT JUDGMENT AND IS BASED ON A NUMBER

OF FACTORS, INCLUDING COMPARABLE COMPANIES SIZES, GROWTH

RATES, INDUSTRIES, DEVELOPMENT STAGES, AND OTHER RELEVANT

FACTORS. THE INCOME APPROACH INCLUDES THE USE OF A DISCOUNTED

CASH FLOW MODEL, WHICH REQUIRES THE FOLLOWING SIGNIFICANT

ESTIMATES FOR THE INVESTEE: REVENUE, BASED ON ASSUMED MARKET

SEGMENT SIZE AND ASSUMED MARKET SEGMENT SHARE; COSTS; AND

DISCOUNT RATES BASED ON THE RISK PROFILE OF COMPARABLE

COMPANIES. ESTIMATES OF MARKET SEGMENT SIZE, MARKET SEGMENT

SHARE, AND COSTS ARE DEVELOPED BY THE INVESTEE

AND/OR

INTEL

USING HISTORICAL DATA AND AVAILABLE MARKET DATA. THE VALUATION

OF THESE NON-MARKETABLE EQUITY INVESTMENTS ALSO TAKES INTO

ACCOUNT VARIABLES SUCH AS CONDITIONS REFLECTED IN THE CAPITAL

MARKETS, RECENT FINANCING ACTIVITIES BY THE INVESTEES, THE

INVESTEES CAPITAL STRUCTURE, AND DIFFERENCES IN SENIORITY

AND RIGHTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE INVESTEES CAPITAL.

ADDITIONALLY, CERTAIN OF OUR

PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT WERE MEASURED AND RECORDED AT FAIR

VALUE DURING 2009 DUE TO EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES WE IDENTIFIED

THAT INDICATED THAT THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE ASSETS OR THE

ASSET GROUPING WAS NOT RECOVERABLE, RESULTING IN

OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY

IMPAIRMENT CHARGES. MOST OF THESE ASSET IMPAIRMENTS RELATED TO

MANUFACTURING ASSETS.

FINANCIAL

INSTRUMENTS NOT RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE ON A RECURRING

BASIS

WE MEASURE OUR EQUITY METHOD

INVESTMENTS, COST METHOD INVESTMENTS, AND COST METHOD LOANS

RECEIVABLE AT FAIR VALUE QUARTERLY; HOWEVER, THEY ARE RECORDED

AT FAIR VALUE ONLY WHEN AN IMPAIRMENT CHARGE IS RECOGNIZED. OUR

NON-FINANCIAL ASSETS, SUCH AS INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND PROPERTY,

PLANT AND EQUIPMENT, ARE MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE WHEN THE

CARRYING AMOUNT EXCEEDS THE UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS, AND ARE

RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE ONLY WHEN AN IMPAIRMENT CHARGE IS

RECOGNIZED.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS THAT ARE NOT

RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE ARE MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE QUARTERLY FOR

DISCLOSURE PURPOSES. THE CARRYING AMOUNTS AND FAIR VALUES OF

OUR NON-MARKETABLE EQUITY

INVESTMENTS INCLUDE OUR INVESTMENT IN NUMONYX. IN FEBRUARY 2010,

WE SIGNED A DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT WITH MICRON TECHNOLOGY, INC.

AND NUMONYX UNDER WHICH MICRON AGREED TO ACQUIRE NUMONYX IN AN

ALL-STOCK TRANSACTION. THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR INVESTMENT IN

NUMONYX WAS BASED ON MANAGEMENTS ASSESSMENT AS OF

DECEMBER 26, 2009, AND THEREFORE THE VALUE IMPLIED BY THE

PENDING SALE WAS NOT INCLUDED IN THAT ASSESSMENT. FOR FURTHER

INFORMATION, SEE NOTE 11: NON-MARKETABLE EQUITY

INVESTMENTS. AS OF DECEMBER 26, 2009, WE HAD

NON-MARKETABLE EQUITY INVESTMENTS IN AN UNREALIZED LOSS POSITION

OF $30 MILLION THAT HAD A FAIR VALUE OF $205 MILLION (UNREALIZED

LOSS POSITION OF $100 MILLION ON NON-MARKETABLE EQUITY

INVESTMENTS WITH A FAIR VALUE OF $270 MILLION AS OF DECEMBER 27,

2008).

THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR LOANS

RECEIVABLE IS DETERMINED USING A DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW MODEL WITH

ALL SIGNIFICANT INPUTS DERIVED FROM OR CORROBORATED WITH

OBSERVABLE MARKET DATA. THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR LONG-TERM DEBT

TAKES INTO CONSIDERATION VARIABLES SUCH AS CREDIT-RATING CHANGES

AND INTEREST RATE CHANGES.

DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

OUR PRIMARY OBJECTIVE FOR HOLDING

DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS IS TO MANAGE CURRENCY EXCHANGE

RATE RISK AND INTEREST RATE RISK, AND TO A LESSER EXTENT, EQUITY

MARKET RISK AND COMMODITY PRICE RISK. WE CURRENTLY DO NOT HOLD

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS FOR THE PURPOSE OF MANAGING CREDIT RISK

SINCE WE LIMIT THE AMOUNT OF CREDIT EXPOSURE TO ANY ONE

COUNTERPARTY AND GENERALLY ENTER INTO DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS

WITH

HIGH-CREDIT-QUALITY

COUNTERPARTIES. FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION, SEE NOTE 9.

GENERALLY HEDGED WITH OFFSETTING CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS,

CURRENCY OPTIONS, OR CURRENCY INTEREST RATE SWAPS. SUBSTANTIALLY

ALL OF OUR REVENUE AND A MAJORITY OF OUR EXPENSE AND CAPITAL

CERTAIN OPERATING EXPENDITURES AND CAPITAL PURCHASES ARE

INCURRED IN OR EXPOSED TO OTHER CURRENCIES, PRIMARILY THE

JAPANESE YEN, THE EURO, AND THE ISRAELI SHEKEL. WE HAVE

ESTABLISHED BALANCE SHEET AND FORECASTED TRANSACTION CURRENCY

RISK MANAGEMENT PROGRAMS TO PROTECT AGAINST FLUCTUATIONS IN FAIR

VALUE AND THE VOLATILITY OF FUTURE CASH FLOWS CAUSED BY CHANGES

IN EXCHANGE RATES. THESE PROGRAMS REDUCE, BUT DO NOT ALWAYS

ENTIRELY ELIMINATE, THE IMPACT OF CURRENCY EXCHANGE MOVEMENTS.

OUR MARKETABLE INVESTMENTS INCLUDE

MARKETABLE EQUITY SECURITIES AND EQUITY DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS.

TO THE EXTENT THAT OUR MARKETABLE EQUITY SECURITIES HAVE

STRATEGIC VALUE, WE TYPICALLY DO NOT ATTEMPT TO REDUCE OR

ELIMINATE OUR EQUITY MARKET EXPOSURE THROUGH HEDGING ACTIVITY.

WE MAY ENTER INTO TRANSACTIONS TO REDUCE OR ELIMINATE THE EQUITY

MARKET RISKS FOR OUR INVESTMENTS IN STRATEGIC EQUITY DERIVATIVE

INSTRUMENTS, INCLUDING WARRANTS. FOR SECURITIES THAT WE NO

LONGER CONSIDER STRATEGIC, WE EVALUATE LEGAL, MARKET, AND

ECONOMIC FACTORS IN OUR DECISION ON THE TIMING OF DISPOSAL AND

WHETHER IT IS POSSIBLE AND APPROPRIATE TO HEDGE THE EQUITY

MARKET RISK. OUR EQUITY MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT PROGRAM INCLUDES

EQUITY DERIVATIVES WITHOUT HEDGE ACCOUNTING DESIGNATION THAT

UTILIZE EQUITY DERIVATIVES, SUCH AS WARRANTS, EQUITY OPTIONS, OR

OTHER EQUITY DERIVATIVES. WE RECOGNIZE CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE

OF SUCH DERIVATIVES IN GAINS (LOSSES) ON OTHER EQUITY

CHANGES IN LIABILITIES RELATED TO THE EQUITY MARKET RISKS OF

CERTAIN DEFERRED COMPENSATION ARRANGEMENTS. GAINS AND LOSSES

FROM CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE OF THESE TOTAL RETURN SWAPS ARE

GENERALLY OFFSET BY THE GAINS AND LOSSES ON THE RELATED

LIABILITIES, BOTH OF WHICH ARE RECORDED IN INTEREST AND OTHER,

AS OF DECEMBER 27, 2008, WE HELD

EQUITY SECURITIES, WHICH WERE CLASSIFIED AS TRADING ASSETS, TO

GENERATE RETURNS THAT SOUGHT TO OFFSET CHANGES IN LIABILITIES

RELATED TO THE EQUITY MARKET RISK OF CERTAIN DEFERRED

COMPENSATION ARRANGEMENTS. DURING 2009, WE SOLD THESE SECURITIES

AND BEGAN UTILIZING DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS TO OFFSET THE EQUITY

MARKET RISKS OF THESE DEFERRED COMPENSATION ARRANGEMENTS. THE

COMMODITIES, AND HAVE ESTABLISHED FORECASTED TRANSACTION RISK

MANAGEMENT PROGRAMS TO PROTECT AGAINST FLUCTUATIONS IN FAIR

VALUE AND THE VOLATILITY OF FUTURE CASH FLOWS CAUSED BY CHANGES

IN COMMODITY PRICES, SUCH AS THOSE FOR NATURAL GAS. THESE

PROGRAMS REDUCE, BUT DO NOT ALWAYS ENTIRELY ELIMINATE, THE

IMPACT OF COMMODITY PRICE MOVEMENTS.

OUR COMMODITY PRICE RISK

MANAGEMENT PROGRAM INCLUDES COMMODITY DERIVATIVES WITH CASH FLOW

CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS THAT

POTENTIALLY SUBJECT US TO CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK CONSIST

PRINCIPALLY OF INVESTMENTS IN DEBT INSTRUMENTS, DERIVATIVE

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, LOANS RECEIVABLE, AND TRADE RECEIVABLES.

WE ALSO ENTER INTO MASTER NETTING ARRANGEMENTS WITH

COUNTERPARTIES WHEN POSSIBLE TO MITIGATE CREDIT RISK IN

DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS. A MASTER NETTING ARRANGEMENT MAY ALLOW

COUNTERPARTIES TO NET SETTLE AMOUNTS OWED TO EACH OTHER AS A

RESULT OF MULTIPLE, SEPARATE DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS.

WE GENERALLY PLACE INVESTMENTS

WITH HIGH-CREDIT-QUALITY COUNTERPARTIES AND, BY POLICY, LIMIT

THE AMOUNT OF CREDIT EXPOSURE TO ANY ONE COUNTERPARTY BASED ON

OUR ANALYSIS OF THAT COUNTERPARTYS RELATIVE CREDIT

STANDING. SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR INVESTMENTS IN DEBT

INSTRUMENTS ARE WITH

A/A2

OR

BETTER RATED ISSUERS, AND A SUBSTANTIAL MAJORITY OF THE ISSUERS

ARE RATED

AA-/AA3

OR

BETTER. OUR INVESTMENT POLICY REQUIRES SUBSTANTIALLY ALL

INVESTMENTS WITH ORIGINAL MATURITIES AT THE TIME OF INVESTMENT

OF UP TO SIX MONTHS TO BE RATED AT LEAST

A-1/P-1

BY

STANDARD & POORS/MOODYS, AND SPECIFIES A HIGHER

MINIMUM RATING FOR INVESTMENTS WITH LONGER MATURITIES. FOR

INSTANCE, INVESTMENTS WITH MATURITIES OF GREATER THAN THREE

YEARS REQUIRE A MINIMUM RATING OF

AA-/AA3

AT

THE TIME OF INVESTMENT. GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS IMPOSED ON

CERTAIN COUNTRIES, RESULT IN SOME MINOR EXCEPTIONS.

CREDIT-RATING

CRITERIA FOR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS ARE SIMILAR TO THOSE FOR

OTHER INVESTMENTS. THE AMOUNTS SUBJECT TO CREDIT RISK RELATED TO

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS ARE GENERALLY LIMITED TO THE AMOUNTS, IF

ANY, BY WHICH A COUNTERPARTYS OBLIGATIONS EXCEED OUR

OBLIGATIONS WITH THAT COUNTERPARTY. AS OF DECEMBER 26, 2009, THE

TOTAL CREDIT EXPOSURE TO ANY SINGLE COUNTERPARTY DID NOT EXCEED

$500 MILLION. WE OBTAIN AND SECURE AVAILABLE COLLATERAL FROM

COUNTERPARTIES AGAINST OBLIGATIONS, INCLUDING SECURITIES LENDING

TRANSACTIONS, WHEN WE DEEM IT APPROPRIATE.

A SUBSTANTIAL MAJORITY OF OUR

TRADE RECEIVABLES ARE DERIVED FROM SALES TO ORIGINAL EQUIPMENT

MANUFACTURERS (OEMS) AND ORIGINAL DESIGN MANUFACTURERS. WE ALSO

HAVE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE DERIVED FROM SALES TO INDUSTRIAL AND

RETAIL DISTRIBUTORS. OUR TWO LARGEST CUSTOMERS ACCOUNTED FOR 38%

OF NET REVENUE FOR 2009 AND 2008, AND 35% OF NET REVENUE FOR

2007. ADDITIONALLY, THESE TWO LARGEST CUSTOMERS ACCOUNTED FOR

41% OF OUR ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AS OF DECEMBER 26, 2009 AND

DECEMBER 27, 2008. WE BELIEVE THAT THE RECEIVABLE BALANCES FROM

THESE LARGEST CUSTOMERS DO NOT REPRESENT A SIGNIFICANT CREDIT

RISK BASED ON CASH FLOW FORECASTS, BALANCE SHEET ANALYSIS, AND

PAST COLLECTION EXPERIENCE.

WE HAVE ADOPTED CREDIT POLICIES

AND STANDARDS INTENDED TO ACCOMMODATE INDUSTRY GROWTH AND

INHERENT RISK. WE BELIEVE THAT CREDIT RISKS ARE MODERATED BY THE

FINANCIAL STABILITY OF OUR MAJOR CUSTOMERS. WE ASSESS CREDIT

RISK THROUGH QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE ANALYSIS, AND FROM

THIS ANALYSIS, WE ESTABLISH CREDIT LIMITS AND DETERMINE WHETHER

WE WILL SEEK TO USE ONE OR MORE CREDIT SUPPORT DEVICES, SUCH AS

OBTAINING SOME FORM OF THIRD-PARTY GUARANTY OR STANDBY LETTER OF

CREDIT, OR OBTAINING CREDIT INSURANCE FOR ALL OR A PORTION OF

THE ACCOUNT BALANCE IF NECESSARY.

WE CONTINUALLY MONITOR THE CREDIT

RISK IN OUR PORTFOLIO AND MITIGATE OUR CREDIT AND INTEREST RATE

EXPOSURES IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE POLICIES APPROVED BY OUR BOARD

OF DIRECTORS. WE INTEND TO CONTINUE TO CLOSELY MONITOR FUTURE

DEVELOPMENTS IN THE CREDIT MARKETS AND MAKE APPROPRIATE CHANGES

TO OUR INVESTMENT POLICIES AS DEEMED NECESSARY.

IMFT/IMFS

MICRON AND INTEL FORMED IM FLASH

TECHNOLOGIES, LLC (IMFT) IN JANUARY 2006 AND IM FLASH SINGAPORE,

LLP (IMFS) IN FEBRUARY 2007. WE ESTABLISHED THESE JOINT VENTURES

TO MANUFACTURE NAND FLASH MEMORY PRODUCTS FOR MICRON AND INTEL.

WE OWN A 49% INTEREST IN EACH OF THESE VENTURES. INITIAL

PRODUCTION AT THE IMFS FABRICATION FACILITY, INCLUDING THE

PURCHASE AND INSTALLATION OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT, REMAINS ON

HOLD. IMFT AND IMFS ARE EACH GOVERNED BY A BOARD OF MANAGERS,

WITH MICRON AND INTEL INITIALLY APPOINTING AN EQUAL NUMBER OF

MANAGERS TO EACH OF THE BOARDS. THE NUMBER OF MANAGERS APPOINTED

BY EACH PARTY ADJUSTS DEPENDING ON THE PARTIES OWNERSHIP

INTERESTS. THESE VENTURES WILL OPERATE UNTIL 2016 BUT ARE

SUBJECT TO PRIOR TERMINATION UNDER CERTAIN TERMS AND CONDITIONS.

THESE JOINT VENTURES ARE VARIABLE

INTEREST ENTITIES. ALL COSTS OF THE JOINT VENTURES WILL BE

PASSED ON TO MICRON AND INTEL THROUGH OUR PURCHASE AGREEMENTS.

IMFT AND IMFS ARE DEPENDENT UPON MICRON AND INTEL FOR ANY

ADDITIONAL CASH REQUIREMENTS. OUR KNOWN MAXIMUM EXPOSURE TO LOSS

APPROXIMATED OUR INVESTMENT BALANCE AS OF DECEMBER 26, 2009,

WHICH WAS $1.6 BILLION IN IMFT/IMFS ($2.1 BILLION AS OF DECEMBER

27, 2008). OUR INVESTMENT IN THESE VENTURES IS CLASSIFIED WITHIN

OTHER LONG-TERM ASSETS. AS OF DECEMBER 26, 2009, EXCEPT FOR THE

AMOUNT DUE TO IMFT/IMFS FOR PRODUCT PURCHASES AND SERVICES, WE

DID NOT INCUR ANY ADDITIONAL LIABILITIES IN CONNECTION WITH OUR

INTERESTS IN THESE JOINT VENTURES. IN ADDITION TO THE POTENTIAL

LOSS OF OUR EXISTING INVESTMENT, OUR ACTUAL LOSSES COULD BE

HIGHER, AS INTEL AND MICRON ARE LIABLE FOR OTHER FUTURE

OPERATING COSTS

AND/OR

OBLIGATIONS OF IMFT/IMFS. IN ADDITION, FUTURE CASH CALLS COULD

INCREASE OUR INVESTMENT BALANCE AND THE RELATED EXPOSURE TO

LOSS. FINALLY, AS WE ARE CURRENTLY COMMITTED TO PURCHASING 49%

OF IMFTS PRODUCTION OUTPUT AND PRODUCTION-RELATED

SERVICES, WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO PURCHASE PRODUCTS AT A COST IN

EXCESS OF REALIZABLE VALUE.

OUR PORTION OF IMFT COSTS,

PRIMARILY RELATED TO PRODUCT PURCHASES AND

START-UP

COSTS, WAS $735 MILLION DURING 2009 ($1.1 BILLION DURING 2008

AND $790 MILLION DURING 2007). THE AMOUNT DUE TO IMFT FOR

PRODUCT PURCHASES AND SERVICES PROVIDED WAS $75 MILLION AS OF

DECEMBER 26, 2009 AND $190 MILLION AS OF DECEMBER 27, 2008.

DURING 2009, $419 MILLION WAS RETURNED TO INTEL BY IMFT, WHICH

IS REFLECTED AS A RETURN OF EQUITY METHOD INVESTMENT WITHIN

INVESTING ACTIVITIES ON THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH

FLOWS ($298 MILLION DURING 2008).

MICRON AND INTEL ARE CONSIDERED

RELATED PARTIES UNDER THE ACCOUNTING STANDARDS FOR CONSOLIDATING

VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES. AS A RESULT, THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY

IS THE ENTITY THAT IS MOST CLOSELY ASSOCIATED WITH THE JOINT

VENTURES. TO MAKE THAT DETERMINATION, WE REVIEWED SEVERAL

FACTORS. THE MOST IMPORTANT FACTORS WERE CONSIDERATION OF THE

SIZE AND NATURE OF THE JOINT VENTURES OPERATIONS RELATIVE

TO MICRON AND INTEL, AND WHICH PARTY HAD THE MAJORITY OF

ECONOMIC EXPOSURE UNDER THE PURCHASE AGREEMENTS. BASED ON THOSE

FACTORS, WE HAVE DETERMINED THAT WE ARE NOT MOST CLOSELY

ASSOCIATED WITH THE JOINT VENTURES; THEREFORE, WE ACCOUNT FOR

OUR INTERESTS USING THE EQUITY METHOD OF ACCOUNTING AND DO NOT

CONSOLIDATE THESE JOINT VENTURES.

NUMONYX

IN 2008, WE DIVESTED OUR NOR FLASH

MEMORY BUSINESS IN EXCHANGE FOR A 45.1% OWNERSHIP INTEREST IN

NUMONYX. FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION, SEE NOTE 16.

DIVESTITURES. OUR INITIAL OWNERSHIP INTEREST, COMPRISING

COMMON STOCK AND A NOTE RECEIVABLE, WAS RECORDED AT $821

MILLION. OUR INVESTMENT IS ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER THE EQUITY METHOD

OF ACCOUNTING, AND OUR PROPORTIONATE SHARE OF THE INCOME OR LOSS

IS RECOGNIZED ON A ONE-QUARTER LAG. DURING 2009, WE RECORDED $31

MILLION OF EQUITY METHOD LOSSES ($87 MILLION IN 2008) WITHIN

GAINS (LOSSES) ON EQUITY METHOD INVESTMENTS, NET. IN 2008, WE

ALSO RECORDED A $250 MILLION IMPAIRMENT CHARGE ON OUR INVESTMENT

IN NUMONYX WITHIN GAINS (LOSSES) ON EQUITY METHOD INVESTMENTS,

NET. FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION, SEE NOTE 5: FAIR VALUE.

AS OF DECEMBER 26, 2009, OUR

INVESTMENT BALANCE IN NUMONYX WAS $453 MILLION AND IS CLASSIFIED

WITHIN OTHER LONG-TERM ASSETS ($484 MILLION AS OF DECEMBER 27,

2008). THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF OUR INVESTMENT IN NUMONYX AS OF

DECEMBER 26, 2009 WAS $274 MILLION BELOW OUR SHARE OF THE BOOK

VALUE OF THE NET ASSETS OF NUMONYX. MOST OF THIS DIFFERENCE HAS

BEEN ASSIGNED TO SPECIFIC NUMONYX LONG-LIVED ASSETS, AND OUR

PROPORTIONATE SHARE OF NUMONYX INCOME OR LOSS WILL BE ADJUSTED

TO RECOGNIZE THIS DIFFERENCE OVER THE ESTIMATED REMAINING USEFUL

LIVES OF THOSE LONG-LIVED ASSETS.

ADDITIONAL TERMS OF OUR INVESTMENT

IN NUMONYX INCLUDE.



WE ARE LEASING A FACILITY IN

ISRAEL TO NUMONYX FOR A PERIOD OF UP TO 24 YEARS UNDER A FULLY

PAID, UP-FRONT OPERATING LEASE. UPON COMPLETION OF THE

DIVESTITURE, WE RECORDED $82 MILLION OF DEFERRED INCOME

REPRESENTING THE VALUE OF THE PREPAID OPERATING LEASE. THE

DEFERRED INCOME WILL GENERALLY OFFSET THE RELATED DEPRECIATION

OVER THE LEASE TERM.



WE ENTERED INTO SUPPLY AND SERVICE

AGREEMENTS THAT INVOLVE THE MANUFACTURE AND THE ASSEMBLY AND

TEST OF NOR FLASH MEMORY PRODUCTS FOR NUMONYX THROUGH 2008. THE

FAIR VALUE OF THESE AGREEMENTS WAS $110 MILLION AND WAS RECORDED

IN OTHER ACCRUED LIABILITIES UPON COMPLETION OF THE TRANSACTION.

THIS AMOUNT WAS RECOGNIZED DURING 2008, PRIMARILY AS A REDUCTION

OF COST OF SALES. SUBSEQUENTLY, WE AGREED WITH NUMONYX TO

CONTINUE CERTAIN SUPPLY AND SERVICE AGREEMENTS, AND THESE

AGREEMENTS ENDED AT THE END OF 2009.



WE ENTERED INTO A TRANSITION

SERVICES AGREEMENT THAT INVOLVED PROVIDING CERTAIN SERVICES,

SUCH AS INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY, SUPPLY CHAIN, AND FINANCE

SUPPORT, TO NUMONYX. THE REIMBURSEMENT FROM NUMONYX FOR THESE

SERVICES OFFSET THE RELATED COST OF SALES AND OPERATING

EXPENSES. MOST OF THE SERVICES PROVIDED UNDER THE AGREEMENT

ENDED DURING 2009.



NUMONYX ENTERED INTO AN UNSECURED,

FOUR-YEAR SENIOR CREDIT FACILITY OF UP TO $550 MILLION,

COMPRISING A $450 MILLION TERM LOAN AND A $100 MILLION REVOLVING

LOAN. INTEL AND STMICROELECTRONICS N.V. HAVE EACH PROVIDED THE

LENDERS WITH A GUARANTEE OF 50% OF THE PAYMENT OBLIGATIONS OF

NUMONYX UNDER THE SENIOR CREDIT FACILITY. A DEMAND ON OUR

GUARANTEE CAN BE TRIGGERED IF NUMONYX IS UNABLE TO MEET ITS

OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE CREDIT FACILITY. ACCELERATION OF THE

OBLIGATIONS OF NUMONYX UNDER THE CREDIT FACILITY COULD BE

TRIGGERED BY A MONETARY DEFAULT OF NUMONYX OR, IN CERTAIN

CIRCUMSTANCES, BY EVENTS AFFECTING THE CREDITWORTHINESS OF

STMICROELECTRONICS OR INTEL. THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT OF FUTURE

UNDISCOUNTED PAYMENTS THAT WE COULD BE REQUIRED TO MAKE UNDER

THE GUARANTEE IS $275 MILLION PLUS ACCRUED INTEREST, EXPENSES OF

THE LENDERS, AND PENALTIES. AS OF DECEMBER 26, 2009, THE

CARRYING AMOUNT OF THE LIABILITY ASSOCIATED WITH THE GUARANTEE

WAS $79 MILLION, UNCHANGED FROM THE AMOUNT INITIALLY RECORDED IN

2008, AND IS INCLUDED IN OTHER ACCRUED LIABILITIES.



OUR NOTE RECEIVABLE IS

SUBORDINATED TO THE SENIOR CREDIT FACILITY AND THE PREFERENTIAL

PAYOUT OF FRANCISCO PARTNERS L.P., AND WILL BE DEEMED

EXTINGUISHED IN LIQUIDATION EVENTS THAT GENERATE PROCEEDS

INSUFFICIENT TO REPAY THE SENIOR CREDIT FACILITY AND FRANCISCO

PARTNERS PREFERENTIAL PAYOUT.

CLEARWIRE

LLC

IN 2008, WE INVESTED $1.0 BILLION

IN CLEARWIRE LLC, A WHOLLY OWNED SUBSIDIARY OF CLEARWIRE

CORPORATION. IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2009, WE INVESTED AN

ADDITIONAL $50 MILLION. OUR INVESTMENT IN CLEARWIRE LLC IS

ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER THE EQUITY METHOD OF ACCOUNTING, AND OUR

PROPORTIONATE SHARE OF THE INCOME OR LOSS IS RECOGNIZED ON A

ONE-QUARTER LAG. DURING 2009, WE RECORDED $27 MILLION OF EQUITY

METHOD LOSSES, WHICH WAS NET OF A GAIN OF $37 MILLION AS A

RESULT OF A DILUTION OF OUR OWNERSHIP INTEREST FROM THE

ADDITIONAL INVESTMENT. DUE TO THE

ONE-QUARTER

LAG, WE DID NOT RECORD EQUITY METHOD ADJUSTMENTS RELATED TO

CLEARWIRE LLC DURING 2008. DURING 2008, WE RECORDED A $762

MILLION IMPAIRMENT CHARGE ON OUR INVESTMENT IN CLEARWIRE LLC TO

WRITE DOWN OUR INVESTMENT TO ITS FAIR VALUE. THE IMPAIRMENT

CHARGE WAS INCLUDED IN GAINS (LOSSES) ON EQUITY METHOD

INVESTMENTS, NET. FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION, SEE NOTE 5: FAIR

ASSOCIATED WITH OUR PHASE CHANGE MEMORY INITIATIVES WITH NUMONYX

FOR A NOTE RECEIVABLE WITH A CONTRACTUAL AMOUNT OF $144 MILLION

APPROXIMATELY 2,500 EMPLOYEES OF OUR NOR FLASH MEMORY BUSINESS

BECAME EMPLOYEES OF NUMONYX. STMICROELECTRONICS CONTRIBUTED

CERTAIN ASSETS TO NUMONYX FOR A NOTE RECEIVABLE WITH A

COLORADO. AS A RESULT OF PLACING THE FACILITY FOR SALE, IN 2006

WE RECORDED A $214 MILLION IMPAIRMENT CHARGE TO WRITE DOWN TO

FAIR VALUE THE LAND, BUILDING, AND EQUIPMENT. WE INCURRED $54

MILLION IN ASSET IMPAIRMENT CHARGES RELATED TO ASSETS THAT WE

SOLD IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE DIVESTITURE OF OUR NOR FLASH MEMORY

BUSINESS IN 2007 AND AN ADDITIONAL $275 MILLION IN 2008. WE

DETERMINED THE IMPAIRMENT CHARGES BASED ON THE FAIR VALUE, LESS

SELLING COSTS, THAT WE EXPECTED TO RECEIVE UPON COMPLETION OF

BOTH THE 2005 AND 2009 DEBENTURES

ARE CONVERTIBLE, SUBJECT TO CERTAIN CONDITIONS, INTO SHARES OF

OUR COMMON STOCK. HOLDERS CAN SURRENDER THE 2005 DEBENTURES FOR

CONVERSION AT ANY TIME. HOLDERS CAN SURRENDER THE 2009

DEBENTURES FOR CONVERSION IF THE CLOSING PRICE OF INTEL COMMON

STOCK HAS BEEN AT LEAST 130% OF THE CONVERSION PRICE THEN IN

EFFECT FOR AT LEAST 20 TRADING DAYS DURING THE 30

DEBENTURES IN CASH OR STOCK AT OUR OPTION. HOWEVER, WE WILL

SETTLE ANY CONVERSION OR REPURCHASE OF THE 2009 DEBENTURES IN

CASH UP TO THE FACE VALUE, AND ANY AMOUNT IN EXCESS OF FACE

VALUE WILL BE SETTLED IN CASH OR STOCK AT OUR OPTION. ON OR

AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2012, WE CAN REDEEM, FOR CASH, ALL OR PART OF

THE 2005 DEBENTURES FOR THE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT, PLUS ANY ACCRUED

AND UNPAID INTEREST, IF THE CLOSING PRICE OF INTEL COMMON STOCK

HAS BEEN AT LEAST 130% OF THE CONVERSION PRICE THEN IN EFFECT

FOR AT LEAST 20 TRADING DAYS DURING ANY 30 CONSECUTIVE

PRICE THEN IN EFFECT FOR AT LEAST 20 TRADING DAYS DURING ANY 30

CONSECUTIVE

EACH HOLDER OF THE DEBENTURES CAN, FOR A PRE-DEFINED PERIOD OF

TIME, REQUIRE US TO REPURCHASE THE HOLDERS DEBENTURES FOR

THE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT PLUS ANY ACCRUED AND UNPAID INTEREST. BOTH

THE 2005 AND 2009 DEBENTURES ARE SUBORDINATED IN RIGHT OF

LIABILITIES OF OUR SUBSIDIARIES. WE HAVE CONCLUDED THAT BOTH THE

2005 AND 2009 DEBENTURES ARE NOT CONVENTIONAL CONVERTIBLE DEBT

INSTRUMENTS AND THAT THE EMBEDDED STOCK CONVERSION OPTIONS

QUALIFY AS DERIVATIVES. IN ADDITION, WE HAVE CONCLUDED THAT THE

CERTAIN OTHER COUNTRIES. THE PLANS, WHICH ARE FUNDED BY ANNUAL

DISCRETIONARY CONTRIBUTIONS BY INTEL, ARE DESIGNED TO PROVIDE

EMPLOYEES WITH AN ACCUMULATION OF FUNDS FOR RETIREMENT ON A

BASIS. OUR CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER (CEO) DETERMINES THE AMOUNTS

TO BE CONTRIBUTED TO THE U.S. PROFIT SHARING PLAN UNDER

DELEGATION OF AUTHORITY FROM OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS, PURSUANT TO

THE TERMS OF THE PROFIT SHARING PLAN. AS OF DECEMBER 26, 2009,

51% OF OUR U.S. PROFIT SHARING FUND WAS INVESTED IN EQUITIES,

AND 49% WAS INVESTED IN

FOR THE U.S. PLANS, WE DEVELOPED

THE DISCOUNT RATE BY CALCULATING THE BENEFIT PAYMENT STREAMS BY

YEAR TO DETERMINE WHEN BENEFIT PAYMENTS WILL BE DUE. WE THEN

MATCHED THE BENEFIT PAYMENT STREAMS BY YEAR TO THE AA CORPORATE

BOND RATES TO MATCH THE TIMING AND AMOUNT OF THE EXPECTED

BENEFIT PAYMENTS AND DISCOUNTED BACK TO THE MEASUREMENT DATE TO

DETERMINE THE APPROPRIATE DISCOUNT RATE. FOR THE

NON-U.S.

PLANS, WE USED TWO APPROACHES TO DEVELOP THE DISCOUNT RATE. IN

CERTAIN COUNTRIES, WE USED A MODEL CONSISTING OF A THEORETICAL

BOND PORTFOLIO FOR WHICH THE TIMING AND AMOUNT OF CASH FLOWS

APPROXIMATED THE ESTIMATED BENEFIT PAYMENTS OF OUR PENSION

PLANS. IN OTHER COUNTRIES, WE ANALYZED CURRENT MARKET LONG-TERM

BOND RATES AND MATCHED THE BOND MATURITY WITH THE AVERAGE

DURATION OF THE PENSION LIABILITIES. THE EXPECTED LONG-TERM RATE

OF RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS ASSUMPTIONS TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION

BOTH DURATION AND RISK OF THE INVESTMENT PORTFOLIOS, AND ARE

DEVELOPED THROUGH CONSENSUS AND BUILDING-BLOCK METHODOLOGIES.

THE CONSENSUS METHODOLOGY INCLUDES UNADJUSTED ESTIMATES BY THE

FUND MANAGER ON FUTURE MARKET EXPECTATIONS BY BROAD ASSET

CLASSES AND GEOGRAPHY. THE BUILDING-BLOCK APPROACH DETERMINES

THE RATES OF RETURN IMPLIED BY HISTORICAL RISK PREMIUMS ACROSS

ASSET CLASSES. IN ADDITION, WE ANALYZED RATES OF RETURN RELEVANT

TO THE COUNTRY WHERE EACH PLAN IS IN EFFECT AND THE INVESTMENTS

APPLICABLE TO THE PLAN, EXPECTATIONS OF FUTURE RETURNS, LOCAL

ACTUARIAL PROJECTIONS, AND THE PROJECTED LONG-TERM RATES OF

RETURN FROM EXTERNAL INVESTMENT MANAGERS. THE EXPECTED LONG-TERM

RATE OF RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS SHOWN FOR THE

NON-U.S.

PLAN ASSETS IS WEIGHTED TO REFLECT EACH COUNTRYS RELATIVE

PORTION OF THE

NON-U.S.

PLAN ASSETS.

FAIR

VALUE OF PLAN ASSETS

FAIR VALUE IS THE PRICE THAT WOULD

BE RECEIVED FROM SELLING AN ASSET OR PAID TO TRANSFER A

LIABILITY IN AN ORDERLY TRANSACTION BETWEEN MARKET PARTICIPANTS

AT THE MEASUREMENT DATE. THE THREE LEVELS OF INPUTS THAT MAY BE

USED TO MEASURE FAIR VALUE OF PLAN ASSETS ARE AS FOLLOWS.

LEVEL

1.

QUOTED PRICES IN

ACTIVE MARKETS FOR IDENTICAL ASSETS.

LEVEL

2.

OBSERVABLE INPUTS

OTHER THAN LEVEL 1 PRICES, SUCH AS QUOTED PRICES FOR SIMILAR

ASSETS, QUOTED PRICES IN MARKETS WITH INSUFFICIENT VOLUME OR

INFREQUENT TRANSACTIONS (LESS ACTIVE MARKETS), OR MODEL-DERIVED

VALUATIONS IN WHICH ALL SIGNIFICANT INPUTS ARE OBSERVABLE OR CAN

BE DERIVED PRINCIPALLY FROM OR CORROBORATED WITH OBSERVABLE

MARKET DATA FOR SUBSTANTIALLY THE FULL TERM OF THE ASSETS. LEVEL

2 INPUTS ALSO INCLUDE NON-BINDING MARKET CONSENSUS PRICES THAT

CAN BE CORROBORATED WITH OBSERVABLE MARKET DATA.

LEVEL

3.

UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS

TO THE VALUATION METHODOLOGY THAT ARE SIGNIFICANT TO THE

MEASUREMENT OF THE FAIR VALUE OF ASSETS.

U.S.

PENSION PLAN ASSETS

IN GENERAL, THE INVESTMENT

STRATEGY FOR U.S. PENSION PLAN ASSETS IS TO MAXIMIZE

RISK-ADJUSTED RETURNS, TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION THE INVESTMENT

HORIZON AND EXPECTED VOLATILITY, TO ENSURE THAT THERE ARE

SUFFICIENT ASSETS AVAILABLE TO PAY PENSION BENEFITS AS THEY COME

DUE. WHEN DEEMED APPROPRIATE, WE MAY INVEST A PORTION OF THE

FUNDS IN FUTURES CONTRACTS FOR THE PURPOSE OF ACTING AS A

TEMPORARY SUBSTITUTE FOR AN INVESTMENT IN A PARTICULAR EQUITY

SECURITY. THE FUND DOES NOT ENGAGE IN SPECULATIVE FUTURES

TRANSACTIONS. THE ALLOCATION TO EACH ASSET CLASS WILL FLUCTUATE

WITH MARKET CONDITIONS, SUCH AS VOLATILITY AND LIQUIDITY

CONCERNS, AND WILL TYPICALLY BE REBALANCED WHEN OUTSIDE THE

TARGET RANGES, WHICH ARE 80% TO 90% FOR FIXED-INCOME DEBT

INSTRUMENT INVESTMENTS AND 10% TO 20% FOR DOMESTIC AND

INTERNATIONAL EQUITY FUND INVESTMENTS. THE FIXED-INCOME DEBT

INSTRUMENT PORTION IS INVESTED LARGELY IN COMMON COLLECTIVE

TRUST FUNDS THAT INVEST IN ONE- TO THREE-YEAR U.S. GOVERNMENT

BONDS AND INVESTMENT-GRADE CREDIT, AND TO A LESSER EXTENT, IN

NON-U.S.,

ASSET-BACKED, AND NON-INVESTMENT-GRADE DEBT. THE EXPECTED

LONG-TERM

EMPLOYEE EQUITY INCENTIVE PLANS

OUR EQUITY INCENTIVE PLANS ARE

BROAD-BASED, LONG-TERM RETENTION PROGRAMS INTENDED TO ATTRACT

AND RETAIN TALENTED EMPLOYEES AND ALIGN STOCKHOLDER AND EMPLOYEE

INTERESTS.

IN MAY 2009, STOCKHOLDERS APPROVED

AN EXTENSION OF THE 2006 EQUITY INCENTIVE PLAN (THE 2006 PLAN).

STOCKHOLDERS APPROVED 134 MILLION ADDITIONAL SHARES FOR

ISSUANCE, INCREASING THE TOTAL SHARES OF COMMON STOCK AVAILABLE

FOR ISSUANCE AS EQUITY AWARDS TO EMPLOYEES AND

NON-EMPLOYEE

DIRECTORS TO 428 MILLION SHARES. THE APPROVAL ALSO EXTENDED THE

EXPIRATION DATE OF THE 2006 PLAN TO JUNE 2012. THE MAXIMUM

NUMBER OF SHARES TO BE AWARDED AS NON-VESTED SHARES (RESTRICTED

STOCK) OR NON-VESTED SHARE UNITS (RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS)

INCREASED TO 253 MILLION SHARES. AS OF DECEMBER 26, 2009, 226

MILLION SHARES REMAINED AVAILABLE FOR FUTURE GRANT UNDER THE

2006 PLAN. WE MAY ASSUME THE EQUITY INCENTIVE PLANS AND THE

OUTSTANDING EQUITY AWARDS OF CERTAIN ACQUIRED COMPANIES. ONCE

THEY ARE ASSUMED, WE DO NOT GRANT ADDITIONAL SHARES UNDER THESE

PLANS.

ALSO IN MAY 2009, STOCKHOLDERS

APPROVED AN EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTION EXCHANGE PROGRAM (OPTION

EXCHANGE) TO GIVE EMPLOYEES (NOT LISTED OFFICERS) THE

OPPORTUNITY TO EXCHANGE ELIGIBLE STOCK OPTIONS FOR A LESSER

NUMBER OF NEW STOCK OPTIONS THAT HAVE APPROXIMATELY THE SAME

FAIR VALUE AS THE OPTIONS SURRENDERED, AS OF THE DATE OF THE

EXCHANGE. THE OPTION EXCHANGE COMMENCED ON SEPTEMBER 28, 2009

AND EXPIRED ON OCTOBER 30, 2009. ELIGIBLE OPTIONS INCLUDED STOCK

OPTIONS GRANTED UNDER ANY INTEL STOCK OPTION OR EQUITY INCENTIVE

PLAN BETWEEN OCTOBER 1, 2000 AND SEPTEMBER 28, 2008 THAT HAD AN

EXERCISE PRICE ABOVE $20.83, WHICH WAS THE 52-WEEK CLOSING-PRICE

HIGH AS OF OCTOBER 30, 2009. A TOTAL OF 217 MILLION ELIGIBLE

STOCK OPTIONS WERE TENDERED AND CANCELLED IN EXCHANGE FOR 83

MILLION NEW STOCK OPTIONS GRANTED. THE NEW STOCK OPTIONS HAVE AN

EXERCISE PRICE OF $19.04, WHICH IS EQUAL TO THE MARKET PRICE OF

INTEL COMMON STOCK (DEFINED AS THE AVERAGE OF THE HIGH AND LOW

TRADING PRICES) ON OCTOBER 30, 2009. THE NEW STOCK OPTIONS WERE

ISSUED UNDER THE 2006 PLAN AND ARE SUBJECT TO ITS TERMS AND

CONDITIONS. THE NEW STOCK OPTIONS VEST IN EQUAL ANNUAL

INCREMENTS OVER A FOUR-YEAR PERIOD FROM THE DATE OF GRANT AND

WILL EXPIRE SEVEN YEARS FROM THE GRANT DATE. USING THE

BLACK-SCHOLES OPTION PRICING MODEL, WE DETERMINED THAT THE FAIR

VALUE OF THE SURRENDERED STOCK OPTIONS ON A

GRANT-BY-GRANT

BASIS WAS APPROXIMATELY EQUAL, AS OF THE DATE OF THE EXCHANGE,

TO THE FAIR VALUE OF THE ELIGIBLE STOCK OPTIONS EXCHANGED,

RESULTING IN INSIGNIFICANT INCREMENTAL SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION.

IN 2009, WE BEGAN ISSUING

RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS WITH BOTH A MARKET CONDITION AND A

SERVICE CONDITION (MARKET-BASED RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS), WHICH

WERE REFERRED TO IN OUR 2009 PROXY STATEMENT AS OUTPERFORMANCE

STOCK UNITS, TO A SMALL GROUP OF SENIOR OFFICERS AND

NON-EMPLOYEE DIRECTORS. THE NUMBER OF SHARES OF INTEL COMMON

STOCK TO BE RECEIVED AT VESTING WILL RANGE FROM 33% TO 200% OF

THE TARGET AMOUNT, BASED ON TOTAL STOCKHOLDER RETURN (TSR) ON

INTEL COMMON STOCK MEASURED AGAINST THE BENCHMARK TSR OF A PEER

GROUP OVER A THREE-YEAR PERIOD. TSR IS A MEASURE OF STOCK PRICE

APPRECIATION PLUS ANY DIVIDENDS PAID IN THIS PERFORMANCE PERIOD.

AS OF DECEMBER 26, 2009, THERE WERE 2 MILLION MARKET-BASED

RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS OUTSTANDING. THESE MARKET-BASED

RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS ACCRUE DIVIDEND EQUIVALENTS AND VEST

THREE YEARS AND ONE MONTH FROM THE GRANT DATE.

IN CONNECTION WITH OUR COMPLETED

ACQUISITION OF WIND RIVER SYSTEMS, WE ASSUMED THEIR EQUITY

INCENTIVE PLANS AND ISSUED REPLACEMENT AWARDS IN THE THIRD

QUARTER OF 2009. THE STOCK OPTIONS AND RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS

ISSUED GENERALLY RETAIN THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THE

RESPECTIVE PLANS UNDER WHICH THEY WERE ORIGINALLY GRANTED. WE

WILL NOT GRANT ADDITIONAL SHARES UNDER THESE PLANS.

EQUITY AWARDS GRANTED TO EMPLOYEES

IN 2009 UNDER OUR EQUITY INCENTIVE PLANS GENERALLY VEST OVER 4

YEARS FROM THE DATE OF GRANT, AND OPTIONS EXPIRE 7 YEARS FROM

THE DATE OF GRANT WITH THE EXCEPTION OF MARKET-BASED RESTRICTED

STOCK UNITS AND REPLACEMENT AWARDS RELATED TO ACQUISITIONS.

EQUITY AWARDS GRANTED TO KEY OFFICERS, SENIOR-LEVEL EMPLOYEES,

AND KEY EMPLOYEES IN 2009 MAY HAVE DELAYED VESTING BEGINNING 3

TO 5 YEARS FROM THE DATE OF GRANT, AND OPTIONS EXPIRE 7 TO 10

YEARS FROM THE DATE OF GRANT.

THE 2006 STOCK PURCHASE PLAN

ALLOWS ELIGIBLE EMPLOYEES TO PURCHASE SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK

AT 85% OF THE VALUE OF OUR COMMON STOCK ON SPECIFIC DATES. UNDER

THE 2006 STOCK PURCHASE PLAN, WE MADE 240 MILLION SHARES OF

COMMON STOCK AVAILABLE FOR ISSUANCE THROUGH AUGUST 2011. AS OF

DECEMBER 26, 2009, 157 MILLION SHARES WERE AVAILABLE FOR

ISSUANCE UNDER THE 2006 STOCK PURCHASE PLAN.

SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION

RECOGNIZED IN 2009 WAS $889 MILLION ($851 MILLION IN 2008 AND

WE ADJUST SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION

THAT WE REALIZED FOR THE TAX DEDUCTION FROM OPTION EXERCISES AND

OTHER AWARDS TOTALED $119 MILLION ($147 MILLION IN 2008 AND $265

WE ESTIMATE THE FAIR VALUE OF

RESTRICTED STOCK UNIT AWARDS WITH TIME-BASED VESTING USING THE

VALUE OF OUR COMMON STOCK ON THE DATE OF GRANT, REDUCED BY THE

PRESENT VALUE OF DIVIDENDS EXPECTED TO BE PAID ON OUR COMMON

STOCK PRIOR TO VESTING. WE ESTIMATE THE FAIR VALUE OF

STOCK

PURCHASE PLAN

APPROXIMATELY 80% OF OUR EMPLOYEES

WERE PARTICIPATING IN OUR STOCK PURCHASE PLAN AS OF DECEMBER 26,

2009. EMPLOYEES PURCHASED 30.9 MILLION SHARES IN 2009 FOR $344

MILLION UNDER THE 2006 STOCK PURCHASE PLAN (25.9 MILLION SHARES

FOR $453 MILLION IN 2008 AND 26.1 MILLION SHARES FOR $428

MILLION IN 2007). AS OF DECEMBER 26, 2009, THERE WAS $9 MILLION

IN UNRECOGNIZED COMPENSATION COSTS RELATED TO RIGHTS TO ACQUIRE

COMMON STOCK UNDER OUR STOCK PURCHASE PLAN. WE EXPECT TO

RECOGNIZE THOSE COSTS OVER A WEIGHTED AVERAGE PERIOD OF ONE

MONTH.

NOTE 24.

COMMON STOCK REPURCHASES

COMMON

STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM

WE HAVE AN ONGOING AUTHORIZATION,

AMENDED IN NOVEMBER 2005, FROM OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS TO

REPURCHASE UP TO $25 BILLION IN SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK IN

OPEN MARKET OR NEGOTIATED TRANSACTIONS. AS OF DECEMBER 26, 2009,

$5.7 BILLION REMAINED AVAILABLE FOR REPURCHASE UNDER THE

EXISTING REPURCHASE AUTHORIZATION. DURING 2009, WE UTILIZED THE

MAJORITY OF THE PROCEEDS FROM THE ISSUANCE OF THE 2009

DEBENTURES TO REPURCHASE 88.2 MILLION SHARES OF COMMON STOCK AT

A COST OF $1.7 BILLION (FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ON THE ISSUANCE

OF THE 2009 DEBENTURES, SEE NOTE 20.

BORROWINGS). WE REPURCHASED 324 MILLION SHARES AT A COST

OF $7.1 BILLION DURING 2008 AND 111 MILLION SHARES AT A COST OF

$2.75 BILLION DURING 2007. WE HAVE REPURCHASED AND RETIRED 3.4

BILLION SHARES AT A COST OF $69 BILLION SINCE THE PROGRAM BEGAN

IN 1990. OUR REPURCHASES IN 2009 AND A PORTION OF OUR PURCHASES

IN 2008 AND 2007 WERE EXECUTED IN PRIVATELY NEGOTIATED

TRANSACTIONS.

RESTRICTED

STOCK UNIT WITHHOLDINGS

WE ISSUE RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS AS

PART OF OUR EQUITY INCENTIVE PLANS. FOR THE MAJORITY OF

RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS GRANTED, THE NUMBER OF SHARES ISSUED ON

THE DATE THE RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS VEST IS NET OF THE MINIMUM

STATUTORY WITHHOLDING REQUIREMENTS THAT WE PAY IN CASH TO THE

APPROPRIATE TAXING AUTHORITIES ON BEHALF OF OUR EMPLOYEES.

DURING 2009, WE WITHHELD 5.8 MILLION SHARES (3.5 MILLION SHARES

DURING 2008 AND 1.7 MILLION SHARES DURING 2007) TO SATISFY $92

MILLION ($78 MILLION DURING 2008 AND $38 MILLION DURING 2007) OF

EMPLOYEES TAX OBLIGATIONS. ALTHOUGH SHARES WITHHELD ARE

NOT ISSUED, THEY ARE TREATED AS COMMON STOCK REPURCHASES IN OUR

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, AS THEY REDUCE THE NUMBER OF

SHARES THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN ISSUED UPON VESTING.

WE COMPUTED OUR BASIC EARNINGS PER

COMMON SHARE USING NET INCOME AVAILABLE TO COMMON STOCKHOLDERS

AND THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE NUMBER OF COMMON SHARES OUTSTANDING

DURING THE PERIOD. WE COMPUTED DILUTED EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE

USING NET INCOME AVAILABLE TO COMMON STOCKHOLDERS AND THE

WEIGHTED AVERAGE NUMBER OF COMMON SHARES OUTSTANDING PLUS

POTENTIALLY DILUTIVE COMMON SHARES OUTSTANDING DURING THE

PERIOD. POTENTIALLY DILUTIVE COMMON SHARES FROM EMPLOYEE

INCENTIVE PLANS ARE DETERMINED BY APPLYING THE TREASURY STOCK

METHOD TO THE ASSUMED EXERCISE OF OUTSTANDING STOCK OPTIONS, THE

ASSUMED VESTING OF OUTSTANDING RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS, AND THE

ASSUMED ISSUANCE OF COMMON STOCK UNDER THE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN.

POTENTIALLY DILUTIVE COMMON SHARES ARE DETERMINED BY APPLYING

THE IF-CONVERTED METHOD FOR THE 2005 DEBENTURES. HOWEVER, AS OUR

2009 DEBENTURES REQUIRE SETTLEMENT OF THE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF

THE DEBT IN CASH UPON CONVERSION, WITH THE CONVERSION PREMIUM

PAID IN CASH OR STOCK AT OUR OPTION, POTENTIALLY DILUTIVE COMMON

SHARES ARE DETERMINED BY APPLYING THE TREASURY STOCK METHOD FOR

THESE DEBENTURES. FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION ON THE SPECIFIC

CONVERSION FEATURES OF OUR 2005 AND 2009 DEBENTURES, SEE

NOTE 20: BORROWINGS.

FOR 2009, WE EXCLUDED 486 MILLION

OUTSTANDING WEIGHTED AVERAGE STOCK OPTIONS (484 MILLION IN 2008

AND 417 MILLION IN 2007) FROM THE CALCULATION OF DILUTED

EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE BECAUSE THE EXERCISE PRICES OF THESE

STOCK OPTIONS WERE GREATER THAN OR EQUAL TO THE AVERAGE MARKET

VALUE OF THE COMMON SHARES. THESE OPTIONS COULD BE INCLUDED IN

THE CALCULATION IN THE FUTURE IF THE AVERAGE MARKET VALUE OF THE

COMMON SHARES INCREASES AND IS GREATER THAN THE EXERCISE PRICE

OF THESE OPTIONS. WE ALSO EXCLUDED OUR 2009 DEBENTURES FROM THE

CALCULATION OF DILUTED EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE BECAUSE THE

CONVERSION OPTION OF THESE DEBENTURES WAS ANTI-DILUTIVE. IN THE

FUTURE, WE COULD HAVE POTENTIALLY DILUTIVE SHARES IF THE AVERAGE

MARKET PRICE IS ABOVE THE CONVERSION PRICE.

THE VALUATION ALLOWANCE IS BASED

ON OUR ASSESSMENT THAT IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT CERTAIN

DEFERRED TAX ASSETS WILL NOT BE REALIZED IN THE FORESEEABLE

FUTURE. THE VALUATION ALLOWANCE AS OF DECEMBER 26, 2009 INCLUDED

ALLOWANCES RELATED TO UNREALIZED STATE CREDIT CARRY FORWARDS OF

DEPRECIATION EXPENSE AND OTHER MATTERS RELATED TO OUR

NOT RECOGNIZED U.S. DEFERRED INCOME TAXES ON A CUMULATIVE TOTAL

SUBSIDIARIES. DETERMINING THE UNRECOGNIZED DEFERRED TAX

LIABILITY RELATED TO INVESTMENTS IN THESE

SUBSIDIARIES THAT ARE INDEFINITELY REINVESTED IS NOT

PRACTICABLE. WE CURRENTLY INTEND TO REINVEST THOSE EARNINGS IN

OPERATIONS OUTSIDE THE U.S.

EFFECTIVE AT THE BEGINNING OF

2007, WE ADOPTED STANDARDS THAT CHANGED THE ACCOUNTING FOR

UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS. AS A RESULT OF THE IMPLEMENTATION OF

THESE STANDARDS, WE REDUCED THE LIABILITY FOR NET UNRECOGNIZED

TAX BENEFITS BY $181 MILLION, AND ACCOUNTED FOR THE REDUCTION AS

A CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF A CHANGE IN ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLE THAT

RESULTED IN AN INCREASE TO RETAINED EARNINGS OF $181 MILLION.

DURING 2007, THE U.S. INTERNAL

REVENUE SERVICE (IRS) CLOSED ITS EXAMINATION OF OUR TAX RETURNS

FOR THE YEARS 1999 THROUGH 2002, RESOLVING ISSUES RELATED TO THE

TAX BENEFITS FOR EXPORT SALES AS WELL AS A NUMBER OF OTHER

ISSUES. ADDITIONALLY, WE REACHED A SETTLEMENT WITH THE IRS FOR

YEARS 2003 THROUGH 2005 WITH RESPECT TO THE TAX BENEFITS FOR

EXPORT SALES. IN CONNECTION WITH THE $739 MILLION SETTLEMENT

WITH THE IRS, WE REVERSED LONG-TERM INCOME TAXES PAYABLE, WHICH

RESULTED IN A $276 MILLION TAX BENEFIT IN 2007.

ALSO DURING 2007, WE EFFECTIVELY

SETTLED WITH THE IRS SEVERAL OTHER MATTERS RELATED TO THE AUDIT

FOR THE 2003 AND 2004 TAX YEARS, DESPITE THE FACT THAT THE IRS

AUDIT FOR THOSE YEARS REMAINS OPEN. THE RESULT OF EFFECTIVELY

SETTLING THOSE POSITIONS AND THE PROCESS OF RE-EVALUATING, BASED

ON ALL AVAILABLE INFORMATION AND CERTAIN REQUIRED

REMEASUREMENTS, WAS A REDUCTION OF $389 MILLION IN THE BALANCE

OF OUR GROSS UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS, $155 MILLION OF WHICH

RESULTED IN A TAX BENEFIT IN 2007.

DURING 2008, WE REACHED A

SETTLEMENT WITH THE IRS AND CERTAIN STATE TAX AUTHORITIES

RELATED TO PRIOR YEARS. THE RESULT OF THE SETTLEMENTS AND

RELATED REMEASUREMENTS WAS A REDUCTION OF $154 MILLION IN THE

BALANCE OF OUR GROSS UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS, $103 MILLION OF

WHICH RESULTED IN A TAX BENEFIT IN 2008.

DURING 2009, WE SETTLED AND

EFFECTIVELY SETTLED MATTERS WITH THE IRS AND CERTAIN STATE TAX

AUTHORITIES RELATED TO TAX POSITIONS TAKEN DURING PRIOR PERIODS.

THE RESULT OF THE SETTLEMENTS, EFFECTIVE SETTLEMENTS, AND

RESULTING REMEASUREMENTS WAS A REDUCTION OF $526 MILLION IN THE

BALANCE OF OUR GROSS UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS, $366 MILLION OF

WHICH RESULTED IN A TAX BENEFIT IN 2009.

IF THE REMAINING BALANCE OF $220

MILLION OF UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS AS OF DECEMBER 26, 2009

($744 MILLION AS OF DECEMBER 27, 2008) WERE REALIZED IN A FUTURE

PERIOD, IT WOULD RESULT IN A TAX BENEFIT OF $101 MILLION AND A

REDUCTION OF THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE ($590 MILLION AS OF DECEMBER

27, 2008).

DURING ALL YEARS PRESENTED, WE

RECOGNIZED INTEREST AND PENALTIES RELATED TO UNRECOGNIZED TAX

BENEFITS WITHIN THE PROVISION FOR TAXES ON THE CONSOLIDATED

STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS. IN 2009, WE RECOGNIZED A NET BENEFIT

OF $62 MILLION, PRIMARILY DUE TO THE REVERSAL OF ACCRUED

INTEREST AND PENALTIES RELATED TO SETTLED AND EFFECTIVELY

SETTLED MATTERS DESCRIBED ABOVE ($6 MILLION OF EXPENSE IN 2008

AND A NET BENEFIT OF $142 MILLION IN 2007). AS OF DECEMBER 26,

2009, WE HAD $55 MILLION OF ACCRUED INTEREST AND PENALTIES

RELATED TO UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS ($153 MILLION AS OF

DECEMBER 27, 2008).

ALTHOUGH THE TIMING OF THE

RESOLUTION

AND/OR

CLOSURE ON AUDITS IS HIGHLY UNCERTAIN, IT IS REASONABLY POSSIBLE

THAT THE BALANCE OF GROSS UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS COULD

SIGNIFICANTLY CHANGE IN THE NEXT 12 MONTHS. HOWEVER, GIVEN THE

NUMBER OF YEARS REMAINING SUBJECT TO EXAMINATION AND THE NUMBER

OF MATTERS BEING EXAMINED, WE ARE UNABLE TO ESTIMATE THE FULL

RANGE OF POSSIBLE ADJUSTMENTS TO THE BALANCE OF GROSS

UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS.

WE HAD STATE TAX CREDITS OF $219

MILLION AS OF DECEMBER 26, 2009 THAT WILL EXPIRE BETWEEN 2010

AND 2020. WE FILE U.S. FEDERAL, U.S. STATE, AND

NON-U.S.

TAX

RETURNS. FOR U.S. STATE AND

NON-U.S.

TAX

RETURNS, WE ARE GENERALLY NO LONGER SUBJECT TO TAX EXAMINATIONS

FOR YEARS PRIOR TO 1996. FOR U.S. FEDERAL TAX RETURNS, WE ARE NO

LONGER SUBJECT TO TAX EXAMINATION FOR YEARS PRIOR TO 2003.

CONTINGENCIES

LEGAL

PROCEEDINGS

WE ARE CURRENTLY A PARTY TO

VARIOUS LEGAL PROCEEDINGS, INCLUDING THOSE NOTED IN THIS

SECTION. WHILE MANAGEMENT PRESENTLY BELIEVES THAT THE ULTIMATE

OUTCOME OF THESE PROCEEDINGS, INDIVIDUALLY AND IN THE AGGREGATE,

WILL NOT MATERIALLY HARM THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL POSITION,

CASH FLOWS, OR OVERALL TRENDS IN RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, LEGAL

PROCEEDINGS AND RELATED GOVERNMENT INVESTIGATIONS ARE SUBJECT TO

INHERENT UNCERTAINTIES, AND UNFAVORABLE RULINGS COULD OCCUR. AN

UNFAVORABLE RULING COULD INCLUDE SUBSTANTIAL MONEY DAMAGES, AND

IN MATTERS FOR WHICH INJUNCTIVE RELIEF OR OTHER CONDUCT REMEDIES

ARE SOUGHT, AN INJUNCTION OR OTHER ORDER PROHIBITING US FROM

SELLING ONE OR MORE PRODUCTS AT ALL OR IN PARTICULAR WAYS,

PRECLUDING PARTICULAR BUSINESS PRACTICES, OR REQUIRING OTHER

REMEDIES SUCH AS COMPULSORY LICENSING OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY.

WERE UNFAVORABLE FINAL OUTCOMES TO OCCUR, THERE EXISTS THE

POSSIBILITY OF A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR BUSINESS,

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL POSITION, AND OVERALL TRENDS.

EXCEPT AS MAY BE OTHERWISE INDICATED, THE OUTCOMES IN THESE

MATTERS ARE NOT REASONABLY ESTIMABLE.

A NUMBER OF PROCEEDINGS, DESCRIBED

BELOW, GENERALLY CHALLENGE CERTAIN OF OUR COMPETITIVE PRACTICES,

CONTENDING GENERALLY THAT WE IMPROPERLY CONDITION PRICE REBATES

AND OTHER DISCOUNTS ON OUR MICROPROCESSORS ON EXCLUSIVE OR

NEAR-EXCLUSIVE DEALING BY SOME OF OUR CUSTOMERS. WE BELIEVE THAT

WE COMPETE LAWFULLY AND THAT OUR MARKETING PRACTICES BENEFIT OUR

CUSTOMERS AND OUR STOCKHOLDERS, AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO

VIGOROUSLY DEFEND OURSELVES. WHILE WE HAVE SETTLED SOME OF THESE

MATTERS, THE DISTRACTIONS CAUSED BY CHALLENGES TO OUR BUSINESS

PRACTICES FROM THE REMAINING MATTERS ARE UNDESIRABLE, AND THE

LEGAL AND OTHER COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH DEFENDING OUR POSITION

HAVE BEEN AND CONTINUE TO BE SIGNIFICANT. WE ASSUME THAT THESE

CHALLENGES COULD CONTINUE FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS AND MAY REQUIRE

THE INVESTMENT OF SUBSTANTIAL ADDITIONAL MANAGEMENT TIME AND

SUBSTANTIAL FINANCIAL RESOURCES TO EXPLAIN AND DEFEND OUR

POSITION.

CLASS ACTIONS AND GOVERNMENT INVESTIGATIONS

IN JUNE 2005, AMD FILED A

COMPLAINT IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT

OF DELAWARE ALLEGING THAT WE AND OUR JAPANESE SUBSIDIARY ENGAGED

IN VARIOUS ACTIONS IN VIOLATION OF THE SHERMAN ACT AND THE

CALIFORNIA BUSINESS AND PROFESSIONS CODE, INCLUDING, AMONG OTHER

THINGS, PROVIDING DISCOUNTS AND REBATES TO OUR MANUFACTURER AND

DISTRIBUTOR CUSTOMERS CONDITIONED ON EXCLUSIVE OR NEAR-EXCLUSIVE

DEALING THAT ALLEGEDLY UNFAIRLY INTERFERED WITH AMDS

ABILITY TO SELL ITS MICROPROCESSORS, INTERFERING WITH CERTAIN

AMD PRODUCT LAUNCHES, AND INTERFERING WITH AMDS

PARTICIPATION IN CERTAIN INDUSTRY STANDARDS-SETTING GROUPS.

AMDS COMPLAINT SOUGHT UNSPECIFIED TREBLE DAMAGES, PUNITIVE

DAMAGES, AN INJUNCTION REQUIRING INTEL TO CEASE ANY CONDUCT

FOUND TO BE UNLAWFUL, AND ATTORNEYS FEES AND COSTS.

AMDS JAPANESE SUBSIDIARY ALSO FILED SUITS IN THE TOKYO

HIGH COURT AND THE TOKYO DISTRICT COURT AGAINST OUR JAPANESE

SUBSIDIARY, ASSERTING VIOLATIONS OF JAPANS ANTIMONOPOLY

LAW AND ALLEGING DAMAGES IN EACH SUIT OF APPROXIMATELY $55

MILLION, PLUS VARIOUS OTHER COSTS AND FEES.

ON NOVEMBER 12, 2009, INTEL

CORPORATION AND AMD ANNOUNCED A COMPREHENSIVE AGREEMENT TO END

ALL OUTSTANDING LEGAL DISPUTES BETWEEN THE COMPANIES, INCLUDING

ANTITRUST LITIGATION AND PATENT CROSS-LICENSE DISPUTES. UNDER

TERMS OF THE AGREEMENT, AMD AND INTEL OBTAINED PATENT RIGHTS

FROM A NEW FIVE-YEAR CROSS-LICENSE AGREEMENT, INTEL AND AMD GAVE

UP ANY CLAIMS OF BREACH FROM THE PREVIOUS LICENSE AGREEMENT, AND

INTEL PAID AMD $1.25 BILLION. WE RECORDED THE RELATED CHARGE

WITHIN MARKETING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE ON THE CONSOLIDATED

STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS. INTEL ALSO AGREED TO ABIDE BY A SET OF

BUSINESS PRACTICE PROVISIONS. AS A RESULT, AMD DROPPED ALL

PENDING LITIGATION, INCLUDING THE CASE IN THE U.S. DISTRICT

COURT IN DELAWARE AND TWO CASES PENDING IN JAPAN. AMD ALSO

WITHDREW ALL OF ITS REGULATORY COMPLAINTS WORLDWIDE.

IN ADDITION, AT LEAST 82 SEPARATE

CLASS ACTIONS HAVE BEEN FILED IN THE U.S. DISTRICT COURTS FOR

THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA, SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF

CALIFORNIA, DISTRICT OF IDAHO, DISTRICT OF NEBRASKA, DISTRICT OF

NEW MEXICO, DISTRICT OF MAINE, AND DISTRICT OF DELAWARE, AS WELL

AS IN VARIOUS CALIFORNIA, KANSAS, AND TENNESSEE STATE COURTS.

THESE ACTIONS GENERALLY REPEAT AMDS ALLEGATIONS AND ASSERT

VARIOUS CONSUMER INJURIES, INCLUDING THAT CONSUMERS IN VARIOUS

STATES HAVE BEEN INJURED BY PAYING HIGHER PRICES FOR COMPUTERS

CONTAINING OUR MICROPROCESSORS. ALL OF THE FEDERAL CLASS ACTIONS

AND THE KANSAS AND TENNESSEE STATE COURT CLASS ACTIONS HAVE BEEN

CONSOLIDATED BY THE MULTIDISTRICT LITIGATION PANEL TO THE

DISTRICT OF DELAWARE. IN JANUARY 2010, THE PLAINTIFFS IN THE

DELAWARE ACTION FILED A MOTION FOR SANCTIONS FOR INTELS

FAILURE TO PRESERVE EVIDENCE. THIS MOTION LARGELY COPIES A

MOTION PREVIOUSLY FILED BY AMD IN THE AMD LITIGATION, WHICH HAS

SETTLED. THE PUTATIVE CLASS IN THE COORDINATED ACTIONS HAS MOVED

FOR CLASS CERTIFICATION, WHICH WE ARE IN THE PROCESS OF

OPPOSING. ALL CALIFORNIA CLASS ACTIONS HAVE BEEN CONSOLIDATED TO

THE SUPERIOR COURT OF CALIFORNIA IN SANTA CLARA COUNTY. THE

PLAINTIFFS IN THE CALIFORNIA ACTIONS HAVE MOVED FOR CLASS

CERTIFICATION, WHICH WE ARE IN THE PROCESS OF OPPOSING. AT OUR

REQUEST, THE COURT IN THE CALIFORNIA ACTIONS HAS AGREED TO DELAY

RULING ON THIS MOTION UNTIL AFTER THE DELAWARE FEDERAL COURT

RULES ON THE SIMILAR MOTION IN THE COORDINATED ACTIONS. WE

DISPUTE THE

CLASS-ACTION

CLAIMS, AND INTEND TO DEFEND THE LAWSUITS VIGOROUSLY.

WE ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO CERTAIN

ANTITRUST REGULATORY INQUIRIES. IN 2001, THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION

(EC) COMMENCED AN INVESTIGATION REGARDING CLAIMS BY AMD THAT WE

USED UNFAIR BUSINESS PRACTICES TO PERSUADE CLIENTS TO BUY OUR

MICROPROCESSORS. SINCE THAT TIME, WE HAVE RECEIVED NUMEROUS

REQUESTS FOR INFORMATION AND DOCUMENTS FROM THE EC, AND WE HAVE

RESPONDED TO EACH OF THOSE REQUESTS. THE EC ISSUED A STATEMENT

OF OBJECTIONS IN JULY 2007 AND HELD A HEARING ON THAT STATEMENT

IN MARCH 2008. THE EC ISSUED A SUPPLEMENTAL STATEMENT OF

OBJECTIONS IN JULY 2008.

ON MAY 13, 2009, THE EC ISSUED A

DECISION FINDING THAT WE HAD VIOLATED ARTICLE 82 OF THE EC

TREATY AND ARTICLE 54 OF THE EUROPEAN ECONOMIC AREA AGREEMENT.

IN GENERAL, THE EC FOUND THAT WE VIOLATED ARTICLE 82 (LATER

RENUMBERED AS ARTICLE 102 BY A NEW TREATY) BY OFFERING

ALLEGED CONDITIONAL REBATES AND PAYMENTS THAT

REQUIRED INTEL CUSTOMERS TO PURCHASE ALL OR MOST OF THEIR X86

MICROPROCESSORS FROM US. THE EC ALSO FOUND THAT WE VIOLATED

ARTICLE 82 BY MAKING ALLEGED PAYMENTS TO PREVENT SALES OF

SPECIFIC RIVAL PRODUCTS. THE EC IMPOSED A FINE ON US IN

THE AMOUNT OF 1.06 BILLION ($1.447 BILLION AS OF MAY 13,

2009), WHICH WE PAID DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2009, AND ALSO

ORDERED US TO IMMEDIATELY BRING TO AN END THE INFRINGEMENT

REFERRED TO IN THE EC DECISION. WE RECORDED THE RELATED

CHARGE WITHIN MARKETING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE ON THE

CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS. WE STRONGLY DISAGREE WITH

THE ECS DECISION, AND WE HAVE APPEALED THE DECISION TO THE

GENERAL COURT (FORMERLY THE COURT OF FIRST INSTANCE). THE EC

ANNOUNCED THAT IT WOULD ACTIVELY MONITOR INTELS COMPLIANCE

WITH ITS DECISION. WE HAVE TAKEN STEPS, WHICH ARE SUBJECT TO THE

ECS ONGOING REVIEW, TO COMPLY WITH THAT DECISION PENDING

APPEAL.

IN JUNE 2005, WE RECEIVED AN

INQUIRY FROM THE KOREA FAIR TRADE COMMISSION (KFTC) REQUESTING

DOCUMENTS FROM OUR KOREAN SUBSIDIARY RELATED TO MARKETING AND

REBATE PROGRAMS THAT WE ENTERED INTO WITH KOREAN PC

MANUFACTURERS. IN FEBRUARY 2006, THE KFTC INITIATED AN

INSPECTION OF DOCUMENTS AT OUR OFFICES IN KOREA. IN SEPTEMBER

2007, THE KFTC SERVED US AN EXAMINATION REPORT ALLEGING THAT

SALES TO TWO CUSTOMERS DURING PARTS OF 20022005 VIOLATED

KOREAS MONOPOLY REGULATION AND FAIR TRADE ACT. IN DECEMBER

2007, WE SUBMITTED OUR WRITTEN RESPONSE TO THE KFTC. IN FEBRUARY

2008, THE KFTCS EXAMINER SUBMITTED A WRITTEN REPLY TO OUR

RESPONSE. IN MARCH 2008, WE SUBMITTED A FURTHER RESPONSE. IN

APRIL 2008, WE PARTICIPATED IN A PRE-HEARING CONFERENCE BEFORE

THE KFTC, AND WE PARTICIPATED IN FORMAL HEARINGS IN MAY AND JUNE

2008. IN JUNE 2008, THE KFTC ANNOUNCED ITS INTENT TO FINE US

APPROXIMATELY $25 MILLION FOR PROVIDING DISCOUNTS TO SAMSUNG

ELECTRONICS CO., LTD. AND TRIGEM COMPUTER INC. IN NOVEMBER 2008,

THE KFTC ISSUED A FINAL WRITTEN DECISION CONCLUDING THAT

INTELS DISCOUNTS HAD VIOLATED KOREAN ANTITRUST LAW AND

IMPOSING A FINE ON INTEL OF APPROXIMATELY $20 MILLION, WHICH

INTEL PAID IN JANUARY 2009. IN DECEMBER 2008, INTEL APPEALED

THIS DECISION BY FILING A LAWSUIT IN THE SEOUL HIGH COURT

SEEKING TO OVERTURN THE KFTCS DECISION. THE KFTC THROUGH

ITS ATTORNEYS FILED ITS ANSWER TO INTELS COMPLAINT IN

MARCH 2009. THEREAFTER INTEL AND THE KFTC WILL PROVIDE ARGUMENTS

TO THE COURT IN SEQUENTIAL BRIEFS.

IN NOVEMBER 2009, THE STATE OF NEW

YORK FILED A LAWSUIT AGAINST INTEL IN THE U.S. DISTRICT COURT

FOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE. THE LAWSUIT ALLEGES THAT INTEL

VIOLATED FEDERAL ANTITRUST LAWS; THE NEW YORK DONNELLY ACT,

WHICH PROHIBITS CONTRACTS OR AGREEMENTS TO MONOPOLIZE; AND THE

NEW YORK EXECUTIVE LAW, WHICH PROSCRIBES UNDERLYING VIOLATIONS

OF FEDERAL AND STATE ANTITRUST LAWS. THE LAWSUIT ALLEGES THAT

INTEL HAS ENGAGED IN A SYSTEMATIC WORLDWIDE CAMPAIGN OF ILLEGAL,

EXCLUSIONARY CONDUCT TO MAINTAIN ITS MONOPOLY POWER AND PRICES

IN THE MARKET FOR X86 MICROPROCESSORS THROUGH THE USE OF VARIOUS

ALLEGED ACTIONS, INCLUDING EXCLUSIVE OR NEAR-EXCLUSIVE

AGREEMENTS FROM LARGE COMPUTER MAKERS IN EXCHANGE FOR

LOYALTY PAYMENTS AND BRIBES, AND OTHER

ALLEGED THREATS AND RETALIATION. THE PLAINTIFF CLAIMS THAT

INTELS ALLEGED ACTIONS HARMED CONSUMERS, COMPETITION, AND

INNOVATION. THE LAWSUIT SEEKS A DECLARATION THAT INTELS

ALLEGED ACTIONS HAVE VIOLATED THE FEDERAL AND NEW YORK ANTITRUST

LAWS AND THE NEW YORK EXECUTIVE LAW, AN INJUNCTION TO PREVENT

FURTHER ALLEGED UNLAWFUL ACTS, UNSPECIFIED DAMAGES IN AN AMOUNT

TO BE PROVEN AT TRIAL, TREBLED AS PROVIDED FOR BY LAW,

RESTITUTION, DISGORGEMENT, $1 MILLION FOR EACH VIOLATION OF THE

DONNELLY ACT PROVEN BY THE PLAINTIFF, AND ATTORNEYS FEES

AND COSTS. IN JANUARY 2010, INTEL FILED ITS ANSWER. INTEL

DISAGREES WITH THE PLAINTIFFS ALLEGATIONS AND CLAIMS, AND

INTENDS TO CONDUCT A VIGOROUS DEFENSE OF THE LAWSUIT.

IN DECEMBER 2009, THE NEW YORK

ATTORNEY GENERALS STAFF SERVED A SUBPOENA ON INTEL. THAT

SUBPOENA CALLS FOR PRODUCTION OF DOCUMENTS AND INFORMATION

RELATED TO VARIOUS ASPECTS OF INTELS NOTEBOOK COMPUTER

BUSINESS, INCLUDING PRODUCTS THAT OFFER GRAPHICS CAPABILITIES

AND/OR

POTENTIALLY COMPETE WITH GRAPHIC PROCESSING UNITS (GPUS). IT

ALSO CALLS FOR PRODUCTION OF ALL DOCUMENTS CONCERNING

INTELS NOTEBOOK COMPUTER BUSINESS THAT INTEL PREVIOUSLY

PRODUCED TO OTHER U.S. AND FOREIGN ANTITRUST AGENCIES IN

CONNECTION WITH THEIR ANTITRUST INVESTIGATIONS OF INTEL.

IN JUNE 2008, THE U.S. FEDERAL

TRADE COMMISSION (FTC) ANNOUNCED A FORMAL INVESTIGATION INTO OUR

SALES PRACTICES. IN JUNE 2009, THE FTC STAFF ASKED FOR

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION AND TESTIMONY BY SOME INTEL WITNESSES.

DURING THE MONTHS THAT FOLLOWED, THE FTC STAFF BROADENED ITS

INQUIRY AND GAVE INTEL ONLY LIMITED OPPORTUNITIES TO ADDRESS

STAFF CONCERNS. SETTLEMENT DISCUSSIONS WERE UNSUCCESSFUL. IN

DECEMBER 2009, THREE FTC COMMISSIONERS VOTED TO ISSUE AN

ADMINISTRATIVE COMPLAINT ALLEGING THAT INTEL HAD VIOLATED

SECTION 5 OF THE FTC ACT BY ENGAGING IN UNFAIR METHODS OF

COMPETITION AND UNFAIR ACTS OR PRACTICES IN MARKETS FOR CPUS AND

GPUS. THIS ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDING WILL LEAD TO A HEARING

BEFORE CHIEF ADMINISTRATIVE LAW JUDGE CHAPPELL THAT IS SET TO

BEGIN IN SEPTEMBER 2010. ANY INITIAL DECISION RENDERED BY JUDGE

CHAPPELL CAN BE APPEALED TO THE COMMISSIONERS BY BOTH THE FTC

STAFF SUPPORTING THE COMPLAINT AND BY INTEL. IF THE FTC

ULTIMATELY ISSUES A DECISION ADVERSE TO INTEL, THAT DECISION CAN

BE APPEALED TO A FEDERAL CIRCUIT OF INTELS CHOOSING. INTEL

DISAGREES WITH THE FTCS ALLEGATIONS AND CLAIMS, AND

INTENDS TO CONDUCT A VIGOROUS DEFENSE.

INTEL/AMD

CROSS-LICENSE AGREEMENT

INTEL AND AMD ENTERED INTO A

PATENT CROSS-LICENSE IN JANUARY 2001. UNDER THAT LICENSE, INTEL

GRANTED AMD A LIMITED LICENSE TO CERTAIN INTEL PATENTS, SUBJECT

TO THE TERMS OF THAT AGREEMENT. IN OCTOBER 2008, AMD ANNOUNCED

ITS INTENTION TO FORM A JOINT VENTURE CALLED THE FOUNDRY COMPANY

(LATER RENAMED GLOBALFOUNDRIES INC.) WITH TWO INVESTMENT

ENTITIES OF THE EMIRATE OF ABU DHABI. IN MARCH 2009, AMD

ANNOUNCED THAT IT HAD CLOSED THIS TRANSACTION. AMD HAS CLAIMED

THAT GLOBALFOUNDRIES IS ENTITLED TO A LICENSE TO INTEL PATENTS

UNDER THE 2001 INTEL/AMD CROSS-LICENSE. INTEL DISAGREED WITH

THAT CLAIM AND ALSO CLAIMED THAT AMD HAD BREACHED THE INTEL/AMD

2001 CROSS-LICENSE. IN NOVEMBER 2009, INTEL AND AMD RESOLVED

THESE DISPUTES AS PART OF A COMPREHENSIVE SETTLEMENT AND ENTERED

DERIVATIVE LITIGATION AND RELATED MATTERS

IN FEBRUARY 2008, MARTIN SMILOW,

AN INTEL STOCKHOLDER, FILED A PUTATIVE DERIVATIVE ACTION IN THE

UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE

AGAINST MEMBERS OF OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS. THE COMPLAINT ALLEGES

GENERALLY THAT THE BOARD ALLOWED THE COMPANY TO VIOLATE

ANTITRUST AND OTHER LAWS, AS DESCRIBED IN AMDS ANTITRUST

LAWSUITS AGAINST US, AND THAT THOSE BOARD-SANCTIONED ACTIVITIES

HAVE HARMED THE COMPANY. THE COMPLAINT REPEATS MANY OF

AMENDED ANSWER, CSIRO CLAIMED THAT VARIOUS INTEL PRODUCTS

COMPLIANT WITH THE IEEE 802.11A, 802.11G,

AND/OR

DRAFT

802.11N STANDARDS INFRINGE THE 069 PATENT. IN 2009, WE

ENTERED INTO A SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT WITH CSIRO PURSUANT TO

LEHMAN

MATTER

IN NOVEMBER 2009, REPRESENTATIVES

OF LEHMAN BROTHERS HOLDINGS INC. ADVISED INTEL INFORMALLY THAT

THE LEHMAN BANKRUPTCY ESTATE WAS CONSIDERING A CLAIM AGAINST

INTEL ARISING FROM A 2008 FORWARD-SHARE PURCHASE CONTRACT. THE

TRANSACTION AT ISSUE WAS BETWEEN INTEL AND LEHMAN BROTHERS OTC

DERIVATIVES INC. (TOGETHER WITH ITS AFFILIATE LEHMAN BROTHERS

HOLDINGS INC., LEHMAN), WHICH ENTERED INTO A

$1.0 BILLION FORWARD-PURCHASE AGREEMENT TO PURCHASE SHARES

OF INTEL COMMON STOCK. UNDER THE TERMS OF THE AGREEMENT, INTEL

PROVIDED A $1.0 BILLION PRE-PAYMENT TO LEHMAN, IN EXCHANGE

FOR WHICH LEHMAN WAS REQUIRED TO PURCHASE $1.0 BILLION IN

SHARES OF INTEL COMMON STOCK, CALCULATED AT A VOLUME WEIGHTED

AVERAGE PRICE FROM AUGUST 26, 2008 TO SEPTEMBER 26, 2008. INTEL

RECEIVED AN EQUIVALENT $1.0 BILLION OF CASH COLLATERAL FROM

LEHMAN. LEHMAN WAS OBLIGATED TO DELIVER APPROXIMATELY 50 MILLION

SHARES OF INTEL COMMON STOCK TO INTEL ON SEPTEMBER 29, 2008.

LEHMAN FAILED TO DELIVER ANY SHARES OF INTEL COMMON STOCK, AND

INTEL FORECLOSED ON THE $1.0 BILLION COLLATERAL. NO

SPECIFIC INFORMATION HAS BEEN PROVIDED BY LEHMAN REGARDING THE

NATURE OR SCOPE OF THE POTENTIAL CLAIMS, OTHER THAN THE

ASSERTION THAT LEHMAN CONTENDS THAT IT SUFFERED DAMAGES IN A

RANGE BETWEEN $130 MILLION AND $380 MILLION. IN FEBRUARY 2010,

LEHMAN SERVED A SUBPOENA ON INTEL IN CONNECTION WITH THIS

TRANSACTION, BUT LEHMAN HAS NOT INITIATED ANY ACTION AGAINST

INTEL TO DATE. WE BELIEVE THAT INTEL ACTED APPROPRIATELY UNDER

ITS AGREEMENT WITH LEHMAN, IN LIGHT OF LEHMANS BANKRUPTCY

FILING, AND WE INTEND TO DEFEND ANY CLAIM TO THE CONTRARY.

SAXON

FRANK T. SHUM V. INTEL

CORPORATION, JEAN-MARC VERDIELL, AND LIGHTLOGIC, INC.

INTEL ACQUIRED LIGHTLOGIC, INC. IN

MAY 2001. FRANK SHUM HAS SUED INTEL, LIGHTLOGIC, AND

LIGHTLOGICS FOUNDER, JEAN-MARC VERDIELL, CLAIMING THAT

MUCH OF LIGHTLOGICS INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY IS BASED ON

ALLEGED INVENTIONS THAT SHUM CONCEIVED WHILE HE AND VERDIELL

WERE PARTNERS AT RADIANCE DESIGN, INC. SHUM HAS ALLEGED CLAIMS

FOR FRAUD, BREACH OF FIDUCIARY DUTY, FRAUDULENT CONCEALMENT, AND

BREACH OF CONTRACT. SHUM ALSO SEEKS ALLEGED CORRECTION OF

INVENTORSHIP OF SEVEN PATENTS ACQUIRED BY INTEL AS PART OF THE

LIGHTLOGIC ACQUISITION. IN JANUARY 2005, THE U.S. DISTRICT COURT

FOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA DENIED SHUMS

INVENTORSHIP CLAIM, AND THEREAFTER GRANTED INTELS MOTION

FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT ON SHUMS REMAINING CLAIMS. IN AUGUST

2007, THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE FEDERAL CIRCUIT

VACATED THE DISTRICT COURTS RULINGS AND REMANDED THE CASE

FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS. IN OCTOBER 2008, THE DISTRICT COURT

GRANTED INTELS MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT ON SHUMS

CLAIMS FOR BREACH OF FIDUCIARY DUTY AND FRAUDULENT CONCEALMENT,

BUT DENIED INTELS MOTION ON SHUMS REMAINING CLAIMS.

A JURY TRIAL ON SHUMS REMAINING CLAIMS TOOK PLACE IN

NOVEMBER AND DECEMBER 2008. IN PRE-TRIAL PROCEEDINGS AND AT

TRIAL, SHUM REQUESTED MONETARY DAMAGES AGAINST THE DEFENDANTS IN

AMOUNTS RANGING FROM $31 MILLION TO $931 MILLION, AND HIS FINAL

REQUEST TO THE JURY WAS FOR AS MUCH AS $175 MILLION. FOLLOWING

DELIBERATIONS, THE JURY WAS UNABLE TO REACH A VERDICT ON MOST OF

THE CLAIMS. WITH RESPECT TO SHUMS CLAIM THAT HE IS THE

PROPER INVENTOR ON CERTAIN LIGHTLOGIC PATENTS NOW ASSIGNED TO

INTEL, THE JURY AGREED WITH SHUM ON SOME OF THOSE CLAIMS. BUT

THE JURY WAS UNABLE TO REACH A VERDICT ON THE BREACH OF

WISCONSIN

ALUMNI RESEARCH FOUNDATION V. INTEL CORPORATION

IN FEBRUARY 2008, THE WISCONSIN

ALUMNI RESEARCH FOUNDATION FILED AN ACTION FOR PATENT

INFRINGEMENT AGAINST INTEL IN THE U.S. DISTRICT COURT FOR THE

WESTERN DISTRICT OF WISCONSIN. THE COMPLAINT GENERALLY ALLEGED

THAT INTEL INFRINGED U.S. PATENT NO. 5,781,752 BY MAKING, USING,

OFFERING FOR SALE, IMPORTING,

AND/OR

SELLING CERTAIN OF INTELS MICROPROCESSORS, INCLUDING THE

INTEL

®

CORE

TM

2

DUO PROCESSOR FAMILY WITH SMART MEMORY ACCESS AND ANY OTHER

MICROPROCESSOR USING THE SAME OR A SIMILAR MEMORY DISAMBIGUATION

TECHNIQUE. IN 2009, WE ENTERED INTO A SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT

PURSUANT TO WHICH, AMONG OTHER THINGS, WE MADE A PAYMENT TO THE

WISCONSIN ALUMNI RESEARCH FOUNDATION IN EXCHANGE FOR A LICENSE

TO CERTAIN PATENTS. THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT DID NOT

SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR CASH FLOWS.

NOTE 29.

OPERATING SEGMENT AND GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION

AT THE END OF 2009, WE REORGANIZED

OUR BUSINESS TO BETTER ALIGN OUR MAJOR PRODUCT GROUPS AROUND THE

CORE COMPETENCIES OF INTEL ARCHITECTURE AND OUR MANUFACTURING

OPERATIONS. AFTER THE REORGANIZATION, WE HAVE NINE OPERATING

SEGMENTS, INCLUDING PC CLIENT GROUP, DATA CENTER GROUP, EMBEDDED

AND COMMUNICATIONS GROUP, DIGITAL HOME GROUP, ULTRA-MOBILITY

GROUP, NAND SOLUTIONS GROUP, WIND RIVER SOFTWARE GROUP, SOFTWARE

AND SERVICES GROUP, AND DIGITAL HEALTH GROUP. ALL PRIOR-PERIOD

AMOUNTS HAVE BEEN ADJUSTED RETROSPECTIVELY TO REFLECT THE NEW

ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE.

THE CHIEF OPERATING DECISION MAKER

(CODM) IS OUR PRESIDENT AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER. THE CODM

ALLOCATES RESOURCES TO AND ASSESSES THE PERFORMANCE OF EACH

OPERATING SEGMENT USING INFORMATION ABOUT ITS REVENUE AND

OPERATING INCOME (LOSS).

OUR PC CLIENT GROUP AND OUR DATA

CENTER GROUP ARE REPORTABLE OPERATING SEGMENTS. WE ALSO

AGGREGATE AND DISCLOSE THE FINANCIAL RESULTS OF THE FOLLOWING

NON-REPORTABLE OPERATING SEGMENTS, WHOSE PRODUCT LINES ARE BASED

ON INTEL ARCHITECTURE: EMBEDDED AND COMMUNICATIONS GROUP,

DIGITAL HOME GROUP, AND ULTRA-MOBILITY GROUP. THESE

NON-REPORTABLE OPERATING SEGMENTS ARE AGGREGATED, AS THEY HAVE

SIMILAR ECONOMIC CHARACTERISTICS AND THEIR OPERATIONS ARE

SIMILAR IN NATURE. THESE AGGREGATED OPERATING SEGMENTS DO NOT

MEET THE QUANTITATIVE THRESHOLDS TO QUALIFY AS REPORTABLE

OPERATING SEGMENTS; HOWEVER, WE HAVE CHOSEN TO DISCLOSE THE

AGGREGATION OF THESE NON-REPORTABLE OPERATING SEGMENTS INTO THE

OTHER INTEL ARCHITECTURE OPERATING SEGMENTS

CATEGORY. REVENUE FOR OUR REPORTABLE AND AGGREGATED

NON-REPORTABLE

OPERATING SEGMENTS IS PRIMARILY RELATED TO THE FOLLOWING PRODUCT

LINES.



PC CLIENT

GROUP.

INCLUDES

MICROPROCESSORS AND RELATED CHIPSETS AND MOTHERBOARDS DESIGNED

FOR THE DESKTOP (INCLUDING HIGH-END ENTHUSIAST PCS), NOTEBOOK,

AND NETBOOK MARKET SEGMENTS; AND WIRELESS CONNECTIVITY PRODUCTS.



DATA CENTER

GROUP.

INCLUDES

MICROPROCESSORS AND RELATED CHIPSETS AND MOTHERBOARDS DESIGNED

FOR THE SERVER, WORKSTATION, AND STORAGE COMPUTING MARKET

SEGMENTS; AND WIRED NETWORK CONNECTIVITY PRODUCTS.



OTHER INTEL ARCHITECTURE

OPERATING

SEGMENTS.

INCLUDES

MICROPROCESSORS AND RELATED CHIPSETS FOR EMBEDDED APPLICATIONS

AND PRODUCTS DESIGNED FOR THE ULTRA-MOBILE MARKET SEGMENT, WHICH

INCLUDES VARIOUS HANDHELD DEVICES; AND PRODUCTS FOR THE CONSUMER

ELECTRONICS MARKET SEGMENTS.

OUR NAND SOLUTIONS GROUP, WIND

RIVER SOFTWARE GROUP, SOFTWARE AND SERVICES GROUP, AND DIGITAL

HEALTH GROUP OPERATING SEGMENTS DO NOT MEET THE QUANTITATIVE

THRESHOLDS TO QUALIFY AS REPORTABLE SEGMENTS AND ARE INCLUDED

WITHIN THE OTHER OPERATING SEGMENTS CATEGORY.

REVENUE WITHIN THE

CORPORATE CATEGORY IS PRIMARILY RELATED TO DIVESTED

BUSINESSES FOR WHICH DISCRETE OPERATING RESULTS ARE NOT REVIEWED

BY OUR CODM TO ASSESS PERFORMANCE AND ALLOCATE RESOURCES. THIS

INCLUDES REVENUE RELATED TO OUR NOR FLASH MEMORY AND CELLULAR

AND HANDHELD BUSINESSES, AS WELL AS REVENUE AND EXPENSES RELATED

TO SUPPLY AND SERVICE AGREEMENTS THAT WERE ENTERED INTO AS PART

OF THESE DIVESTITURES (SEE NOTE 16: DIVESTITURES).

WE HAVE SALES AND MARKETING,

MANUFACTURING, FINANCE, AND ADMINISTRATION GROUPS. EXPENSES FOR

THESE GROUPS ARE GENERALLY ALLOCATED TO THE OPERATING SEGMENTS,

AND THE EXPENSES ARE INCLUDED IN THE OPERATING RESULTS REPORTED

BELOW.



RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OF SEED

BUSINESSES THAT SUPPORT OUR INITIATIVES; AND



ACQUISITION-RELATED COSTS,

INCLUDING AMORTIZATION AND ANY IMPAIRMENT OF ACQUISITION-RELATED

INTANGIBLES AND GOODWILL.

THE CODM DOES NOT EVALUATE

OPERATING SEGMENTS USING DISCRETE ASSET INFORMATION. OPERATING

SEGMENTS DO NOT RECORD INTER-SEGMENT REVENUE, AND, ACCORDINGLY,

THERE IS NONE TO BE REPORTED. WE DO NOT ALLOCATE GAINS AND

LOSSES FROM EQUITY INVESTMENTS, INTEREST AND OTHER INCOME, OR

TAXES TO OPERATING SEGMENTS. ALTHOUGH THE CODM USES OPERATING

INCOME TO EVALUATE THE SEGMENTS, OPERATING COSTS INCLUDED IN ONE

SEGMENT MAY BENEFIT OTHER SEGMENTS. EXCEPT AS DISCUSSED ABOVE,

THE ACCOUNTING POLICIES FOR SEGMENT REPORTING ARE THE SAME AS

FOR INTEL AS A WHOLE.

WE HAVE AUDITED THE ACCOMPANYING

CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS OF INTEL CORPORATION AS OF DECEMBER

26, 2009 AND DECEMBER 27, 2008, AND THE RELATED CONSOLIDATED

STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS, STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY, AND CASH

FLOWS FOR EACH OF THE THREE YEARS IN THE PERIOD ENDED DECEMBER

26, 2009. OUR AUDITS ALSO INCLUDED THE FINANCIAL STATEMENT

SCHEDULE LISTED IN THE INDEX AT PART IV, ITEM 15. THESE

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SCHEDULE ARE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE

COMPANYS MANAGEMENT. OUR RESPONSIBILITY IS TO EXPRESS AN

OPINION ON THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SCHEDULE BASED ON OUR

AUDITS.

WE CONDUCTED OUR AUDITS IN

ACCORDANCE WITH THE STANDARDS OF THE PUBLIC COMPANY ACCOUNTING

OVERSIGHT BOARD (UNITED STATES). THOSE STANDARDS REQUIRE THAT WE

PLAN AND PERFORM THE AUDIT TO OBTAIN REASONABLE ASSURANCE ABOUT

WHETHER THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE FREE OF MATERIAL

MISSTATEMENT. AN AUDIT INCLUDES EXAMINING, ON A TEST BASIS,

EVIDENCE SUPPORTING THE AMOUNTS AND DISCLOSURES IN THE FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS. AN AUDIT ALSO INCLUDES ASSESSING THE ACCOUNTING

PRINCIPLES USED AND SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES MADE BY MANAGEMENT, AS

WELL AS EVALUATING THE OVERALL FINANCIAL STATEMENT PRESENTATION.

WE BELIEVE THAT OUR AUDITS PROVIDE A REASONABLE BASIS FOR OUR

OPINION.

IN OUR OPINION, THE FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS REFERRED TO ABOVE PRESENT FAIRLY, IN ALL MATERIAL

RESPECTS, THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL POSITION OF INTEL

CORPORATION AT DECEMBER 26, 2009 AND DECEMBER 27, 2008, AND THE

CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF ITS OPERATIONS AND ITS CASH FLOWS FOR

EACH OF THE THREE YEARS IN THE PERIOD ENDED DECEMBER 26, 2009,

IN CONFORMITY WITH U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING

PRINCIPLES. ALSO, IN OUR OPINION, THE RELATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENT SCHEDULE, WHEN CONSIDERED IN RELATION TO THE BASIC

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS TAKEN AS A WHOLE, PRESENTS FAIRLY IN ALL

MATERIAL RESPECTS THE INFORMATION SET FORTH THEREIN.

AS DISCUSSED IN NOTES 3 AND 27 TO

THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, INTEL CORPORATION CHANGED

ITS METHOD OF ACCOUNTING FOR CONVERTIBLE DEBT INSTRUMENTS WITH

CASH SETTLEMENT FEATURES DURING 2009, ITS METHOD OF ACCOUNTING

FOR SABBATICAL LEAVE AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2006, AND ITS METHOD OF

WE ALSO HAVE AUDITED, IN

ACCORDANCE WITH THE STANDARDS OF THE PUBLIC COMPANY ACCOUNTING

OVERSIGHT BOARD (UNITED STATES), INTEL CORPORATIONS

INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF DECEMBER 26,

2009, BASED ON CRITERIA ESTABLISHED IN INTERNAL

CONTROLINTEGRATED FRAMEWORK ISSUED BY THE COMMITTEE OF

THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND STOCKHOLDERS, INTEL

WE HAVE AUDITED INTEL

CORPORATIONS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS

OF DECEMBER 26, 2009, BASED ON CRITERIA ESTABLISHED IN INTERNAL

CONTROLINTEGRATED FRAMEWORK ISSUED BY THE COMMITTEE OF

SPONSORING ORGANIZATIONS OF THE TREADWAY COMMISSION (THE COSO

CRITERIA). INTEL CORPORATIONS MANAGEMENT IS RESPONSIBLE

FOR MAINTAINING EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL

REPORTING, AND FOR ITS ASSESSMENT OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF

INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING INCLUDED IN THE

ACCOMPANYING MANAGEMENT REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER

FINANCIAL REPORTING. OUR RESPONSIBILITY IS TO EXPRESS AN OPINION

ON THE COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

BASED ON OUR AUDIT.

WE CONDUCTED OUR AUDIT IN

ACCORDANCE WITH THE STANDARDS OF THE PUBLIC COMPANY ACCOUNTING

OVERSIGHT BOARD (UNITED STATES). THOSE STANDARDS REQUIRE THAT WE

PLAN AND PERFORM THE AUDIT TO OBTAIN REASONABLE ASSURANCE ABOUT

WHETHER EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING WAS

MAINTAINED IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS. OUR AUDIT INCLUDED

OBTAINING AN UNDERSTANDING OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL

REPORTING, ASSESSING THE RISK THAT A MATERIAL WEAKNESS EXISTS,

TESTING AND EVALUATING THE DESIGN AND OPERATING EFFECTIVENESS OF

INTERNAL CONTROL BASED ON THE ASSESSED RISK, AND PERFORMING SUCH

OTHER PROCEDURES AS WE CONSIDERED NECESSARY IN THE

CIRCUMSTANCES. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR AUDIT PROVIDES A REASONABLE

BASIS FOR OUR OPINION.

A COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL

OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING IS A PROCESS DESIGNED TO PROVIDE

REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING THE RELIABILITY OF FINANCIAL

REPORTING AND THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR

EXTERNAL PURPOSES IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED

ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES. A COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER

FINANCIAL REPORTING INCLUDES THOSE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES THAT

(1) PERTAIN TO THE MAINTENANCE OF RECORDS THAT, IN REASONABLE

DETAIL, ACCURATELY AND FAIRLY REFLECT THE TRANSACTIONS AND

DISPOSITIONS OF THE ASSETS OF THE COMPANY; (2) PROVIDE

REASONABLE ASSURANCE THAT TRANSACTIONS ARE RECORDED AS NECESSARY

TO PERMIT PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH

GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES, AND THAT RECEIPTS AND

EXPENDITURES OF THE COMPANY ARE BEING MADE ONLY IN ACCORDANCE

WITH AUTHORIZATIONS OF MANAGEMENT AND DIRECTORS OF THE COMPANY;

AND (3) PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING PREVENTION OR

TIMELY DETECTION OF UNAUTHORIZED ACQUISITION, USE, OR

DISPOSITION OF THE COMPANYS ASSETS THAT COULD HAVE A

MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

BECAUSE OF ITS INHERENT

LIMITATIONS, INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING MAY NOT

PREVENT OR DETECT MISSTATEMENTS. ALSO, PROJECTIONS OF ANY

EVALUATION OF EFFECTIVENESS TO FUTURE PERIODS ARE SUBJECT TO THE

RISK THAT CONTROLS MAY BECOME INADEQUATE BECAUSE OF CHANGES IN

CONDITIONS, OR THAT THE DEGREE OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE POLICIES

OR PROCEDURES MAY DETERIORATE.

IN OUR OPINION, INTEL CORPORATION

MAINTAINED, IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS, EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL

OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF DECEMBER 26, 2009, BASED ON THE

COSO CRITERIA.

WE ALSO HAVE AUDITED, IN

ACCORDANCE WITH THE STANDARDS OF THE PUBLIC COMPANY ACCOUNTING

OVERSIGHT BOARD (UNITED STATES), THE 2009 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS OF INTEL CORPORATION AND OUR REPORT DATED FEBRUARY

22, 2010 EXPRESSED AN UNQUALIFIED OPINION THEREON.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

INHERENT

LIMITATIONS ON EFFECTIVENESS OF CONTROLS

OUR MANAGEMENT, INCLUDING THE CEO

AND CFO, DOES NOT EXPECT THAT OUR DISCLOSURE CONTROLS OR OUR

INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING WILL PREVENT OR DETECT

ALL ERROR AND ALL FRAUD. A CONTROL SYSTEM, NO MATTER HOW WELL

DESIGNED AND OPERATED, CAN PROVIDE ONLY REASONABLE, NOT

ABSOLUTE, ASSURANCE THAT THE CONTROL SYSTEMS OBJECTIVES

WILL BE MET. THE DESIGN OF A CONTROL SYSTEM MUST REFLECT THE

FACT THAT THERE ARE RESOURCE CONSTRAINTS, AND THE BENEFITS OF

CONTROLS MUST BE CONSIDERED RELATIVE TO THEIR COSTS. FURTHER,

BECAUSE OF THE INHERENT LIMITATIONS IN ALL CONTROL SYSTEMS, NO

EVALUATION OF CONTROLS CAN PROVIDE ABSOLUTE ASSURANCE THAT

MISSTATEMENTS DUE TO ERROR OR FRAUD WILL NOT OCCUR OR THAT ALL

CONTROL ISSUES AND INSTANCES OF FRAUD, IF ANY, HAVE BEEN

DETECTED. THE DESIGN OF ANY SYSTEM OF CONTROLS IS BASED IN PART

ON CERTAIN ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT THE LIKELIHOOD OF FUTURE EVENTS,

AND THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT ANY DESIGN WILL SUCCEED IN

ACHIEVING ITS STATED GOALS UNDER ALL POTENTIAL FUTURE

CONDITIONS. PROJECTIONS OF ANY EVALUATION OF THE EFFECTIVENESS

OF CONTROLS TO FUTURE PERIODS ARE SUBJECT TO RISKS. OVER TIME,

CONTROLS MAY BECOME INADEQUATE BECAUSE OF CHANGES IN CONDITIONS

OR DETERIORATION IN THE DEGREE OF COMPLIANCE WITH POLICIES OR
