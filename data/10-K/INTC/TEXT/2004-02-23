NET REVENUE FOR THE INTEL ARCHITECTURE OPERATING SEGMENT MADE UP APPROXIMATELY 87% OF OUR CONSOLIDATED NET REVENUE IN 2003. REVENUE FROM SALES OF MICROPROCESSORS WITHIN THE INTEL ARCHITECTURE OPERATING SEGMENT

REPRESENTED APPROXIMATELY 73% OF CONSOLIDATED NET REVENUE IN 2003. OUR MICROPROCESSOR BUSINESS GENERALLY HAS FOLLOWED A SEASONAL TREND; HOWEVER, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THIS TREND WILL CONTINUE. FOR THE PAST FIVE YEARS, THE COMPANYS

SALES OF MICROPROCESSORS WERE HIGHER IN THE SECOND HALF OF THE YEAR, PRIMARILY DUE TO BACK-TO-SCHOOL AND HOLIDAY DEMAND.

MICROPROCESSORS

A MICROPROCESSOR IS THE CENTRAL PROCESSING UNIT (CPU) OF A COMPUTER SYSTEM. IT PROCESSES SYSTEM DATA AND CONTROLS OTHER DEVICES IN THE SYSTEM, ACTING AS

THE BRAINS OF THE COMPUTER. ONE INDICATOR OF MICROPROCESSOR PERFORMANCE IS ITS CLOCK SPEED, THE RATE AT WHICH ITS INTERNAL LOGIC OPERATES, WHICH IS MEASURED IN UNITS OF HERTZ, OR CYCLES PROCESSED PER SECOND. ONE MEGAHERTZ (MHZ) EQUALS

ONE MILLION CYCLES PROCESSED PER SECOND, AND ONE GIGAHERTZ (GHZ) EQUALS ONE BILLION CYCLES PROCESSED PER SECOND. OTHER FACTORS AFFECTING COMPUTER PERFORMANCE INCLUDE THE AMOUNT OF MEMORY STORAGE, THE SPEED OF MEMORY ACCESS, THE MICROARCHITECTURE

DESIGN OF THE CPU AND THE SPEED OF COMMUNICATION BETWEEN THE CPU AND THE CHIPSET. THE MEMORY STORED ON A CHIP IS MEASURED IN BYTES, WITH 1,024 BYTES

2

TABLE OF CONTENTS

INDEX TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

EQUALING A KILOBYTE (KB), 1.049 MILLION BYTES EQUALING A MEGABYTE (MB) AND 1.074 BILLION BYTES EQUALING A GIGABYTE (GB). CACHE IS A MEMORY THAT CAN BE

LOCATED DIRECTLY ON THE MICROPROCESSOR, PERMITTING QUICKER ACCESS TO FREQUENTLY USED DATA AND INSTRUCTIONS. SOME OF OUR MICROPROCESSORS HAVE ADDITIONAL LEVELS OF CACHE, SECOND LEVEL (L2) CACHE AND THIRD LEVEL (L3) CACHE, TO OFFER HIGHER LEVELS OF

PERFORMANCE. OTHER MICROPROCESSOR FEATURES CAN ALSO ENHANCE SYSTEM PERFORMANCE OR END-USER EXPERIENCE BY RUNNING SOFTWARE MORE EFFICIENTLY. FOR EXAMPLE, WE CURRENTLY OFFER MICROPROCESSORS WITH HYPER-THREADING TECHNOLOGY (HT TECHNOLOGY), WHICH ALLOWS

A SINGLE PROCESSOR TO HANDLE TWO SETS OF INSTRUCTIONS SIMULTANEOUSLY. THIS CAPABILITY PROVIDES BENEFITS IN TWO WAYS: IT HELPS TO RUN MULTITHREADED SOFTWARE, WHICH IS DESIGNED TO EXECUTE DIFFERENT PARTS OF A PROGRAM SIMULTANEOUSLY, OR

HELPS TO USE MULTIPLE SOFTWARE PROGRAMS SIMULTANEOUSLY IN A MULTITASKING ENVIRONMENT. TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE HT TECHNOLOGY CAPABILITY, A COMPUTER SYSTEM MUST HAVE A MICROPROCESSOR THAT SUPPORTS THE TECHNOLOGY, A CHIPSET AND BIOS (BASIC

INPUT/OUTPUT SYSTEM) THAT USE THE TECHNOLOGY AND AN OPERATING SYSTEM THAT INCLUDES OPTIMIZATIONS FOR THE TECHNOLOGY. PERFORMANCE WILL VARY DEPENDING ON THE SYSTEM HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE USED.

IN 2003, WE MANUFACTURED A MAJORITY OF OUR MICROPROCESSORS AND CHIPSETS USING

OUR 130-NANOMETER (0.13-MICRON) PROCESS TECHNOLOGY. IN DECEMBER 2003, WE BEGAN SELLING PROCESSORS MANUFACTURED USING OUR 90-NANOMETER PROCESS TECHNOLOGY ON 300MM WAFERS, AND WE INTRODUCED THESE INTEL PENTIUM 4 PROCESSORS (FORMERLY CODE-NAMED

PRESCOTT) IN FEBRUARY 2004. ONE MICRON EQUALS ONE MILLIONTH OF A METER, AND ONE NANOMETER IS ONE THOUSANDTH OF A MICRON, OR ONE BILLIONTH OF A METER. AS WE MOVE TO EACH SUCCEEDING GENERATION OF MANUFACTURING PROCESS TECHNOLOGY, WE

UTILIZE LESS SPACE PER TRANSISTOR, WHICH ENABLES US TO FIT MORE TRANSISTORS ON AN EQUIVALENT SIZE CHIP, DECREASE THE SIZE OF THE CHIP, OR OFFER AN INCREASED NUMBER OF INTEGRATED FEATURES. THIS DECREASE IN SIZE CAN ALSO RESULT IN FASTER

MICROPROCESSORS AND SEMICONDUCTOR PRODUCTS THAT CONSUME LESS POWER AND/OR PRODUCTS THAT COST LESS TO MANUFACTURE.

THE CONVERSION TO USING 300MM WAFERS FROM 200MM WAFERS, WHICH BEGAN IN 2002 AND CONTINUED IN 2003, ALLOWS FOR MORE EFFICIENT USE

OF OUR CAPITAL INVESTMENT IN EQUIPMENT BY PROVIDING MORE THAN TWICE AS MANY EQUIVALENT CHIPS PER WAFER. SEE THE DISCUSSION OF MANUFACTURING PROCESS TECHNOLOGIES UNDER THE HEADING MANUFACTURING, ASSEMBLY AND TEST IN PART I, ITEM 1 OF THIS

FORM 10-K.

IN 2003, WE ANNOUNCED A NUMBER OF NEW

MANUFACTURING, ASSEMBLY AND TEST

AS OF YEAR-END 2003, MORE THAN 75% OF OUR WAFER MANUFACTURING, INCLUDING

MICROPROCESSOR, CHIPSET, FLASH MEMORY AND NETWORKING SILICON FABRICATION, WAS CONDUCTED WITHIN THE U.S. AT OUR FACILITIES IN OREGON, ARIZONA, NEW MEXICO, MASSACHUSETTS, CALIFORNIA AND COLORADO. OUTSIDE THE U.S., ALMOST 25% OF OUR WAFER

MANUFACTURING, ALSO INCLUDING WAFER FABRICATION FOR MICROPROCESSORS, CHIPSETS, FLASH MEMORY AND NETWORKING SILICON, WAS CONDUCTED AT OUR FACILITIES IN ISRAEL AND IRELAND. CURRENTLY, OUR FACILITIES IN ISRAEL MANUFACTURE PRIMARILY CHIPSETS.

IN 2003, WE CONTINUED TO TRANSITION OUR MANUFACTURING

FACILITIES FROM 200MM (8-INCH) WAFERS TO 300MM (12-INCH) WAFERS. THE CONVERSION TO 300MM WAFERS ALLOWS FOR MORE EFFICIENT USE OF OUR CAPITAL INVESTMENT IN EQUIPMENT BY PROVIDING MORE THAN TWICE AS MANY EQUIVALENT CHIPS PER WAFER AS 200MM WAFERS. TWO

OF OUR FACILITIES, IN OREGON AND NEW MEXICO, CURRENTLY MANUFACTURE PRODUCTS USING 300MM WAFERS. WE EXPECT TO HAVE THREE 300MM WAFER FABRICATION FACILITIES BY THE END OF 2004, WITH THE THIRD FACILITY UNDER CONSTRUCTION IN IRELAND. WE ALSO ANNOUNCED

PLANS FOR TWO ADDITIONAL FACILITIES, IN OREGON AND ARIZONA, TO START PRODUCTION USING 300MM WAFERS AFTER 2004. HOWEVER, AS OF YEAR-END 2003, A SUBSTANTIAL MAJORITY OF OUR MICROPROCESSORS AND CHIPSETS WERE MANUFACTURED ON 200MM WAFERS IN ARIZONA,

OREGON, ISRAEL, MASSACHUSETTS, IRELAND, NEW MEXICO AND CALIFORNIA.

WE ALSO BEGAN MANUFACTURING MICROPROCESSORS ON OUR MOST ADVANCED 90-NANOMETER (A NANOMETER IS ONE

BILLIONTH OF A METER) PROCESS TECHNOLOGY, THE NEXT GENERATION BEYOND OUR 130-NANOMETER (0.13-MICRON) PROCESS TECHNOLOGY. THE 90-NANOMETER PROCESS TECHNOLOGY IS OUR MOST ADVANCED HIGH-VOLUME PRODUCTION PROCESS FEATURING STRUCTURES SMALLER THAN THE

SIZE OF A VIRUS, THE SMALLEST MICROORGANISM. AS WE MOVE TO EACH SUCCEEDING GENERATION OF MANUFACTURING PROCESS TECHNOLOGY, WE UTILIZE LESS SPACE PER TRANSISTOR, WHICH ENABLES US TO PUT MORE TRANSISTORS ON AN EQUIVALENT SIZE CHIP, DECREASE THE SIZE

OF THE CHIP OR OFFER AN INCREASED NUMBER OF INTEGRATED FEATURES, WHICH CAN RESULT IN FASTER MICROPROCESSORS, PRODUCTS THAT CONSUME LESS POWER AND/OR PRODUCTS THAT COST LESS TO MANUFACTURE. AS OF YEAR-END 2003, THE MAJORITY OF OUR MICROPROCESSORS AND

CHIPSETS WERE MANUFACTURED USING OUR 130-NANOMETER PROCESS TECHNOLOGY.

WE MANUFACTURE FLASH MEMORY USING OUR 130-NANOMETER PROCESS TECHNOLOGY PRIMARILY IN NEW MEXICO, AND ALSO IN IRELAND AND CALIFORNIA. WE ALSO MANUFACTURE FLASH MEMORY IN COLORADO USING OUR 180-NANOMETER (0.18-MICRON) TECHNOLOGY.

WE MANUFACTURE MICROPROCESSOR- AND NETWORKING-RELATED BOARD-LEVEL

PRODUCTS, PRIMARILY IN MALAYSIA AND CALIFORNIA. WE ALSO USE SUBCONTRACTORS TO MANUFACTURE SOME BOARD-LEVEL PRODUCTS AND SYSTEMS, AND PURCHASE CERTAIN COMMUNICATIONS NETWORKING PRODUCTS FROM EXTERNAL VENDORS, PRIMARILY IN THE ASIA-PACIFIC REGION.

WE PERFORM A SUBSTANTIAL MAJORITY OF OUR COMPONENTS ASSEMBLY

AND TEST AT FACILITIES IN MALAYSIA, THE PHILIPPINES, COSTA RICA AND CHINA. IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2003, WE ANNOUNCED PLANS TO BEGIN CONSTRUCTION ON AN ADDITIONAL ASSEMBLY AND TEST FACILITY IN CHENGDU, CHINA. WE PLAN TO CONTINUE TO INVEST IN NEW

ASSEMBLY AND TEST TECHNOLOGIES AND FACILITIES TO KEEP PACE WITH OUR MICROPROCESSOR, CHIPSET AND FLASH TECHNOLOGY IMPROVEMENTS. TO AUGMENT CAPACITY IN THE U.S. AS WELL AS INTERNATIONALLY, WE USE SUBCONTRACTORS TO PERFORM ASSEMBLY OF CERTAIN PRODUCTS,

PRIMARILY FLASH MEMORY, CHIPSETS, AND NETWORKING AND COMMUNICATIONS PRODUCTS, AS WELL AS THIRD-PARTY MANUFACTURING SERVICES (FOUNDRIES) TO MANUFACTURE WAFERS FOR CERTAIN COMPONENTS, INCLUDING NETWORKING AND COMMUNICATIONS PRODUCTS. OUR PERFORMANCE

EXPECTATIONS FOR BUSINESS INTEGRITY; ETHICS; ENVIRONMENTAL, HEALTH AND SAFETY COMPLIANCE; AND EMPLOYMENT PRACTICES ARE THE SAME REGARDLESS OF WHETHER OUR SUPPLIER AND SUBCONTRACTOR OPERATIONS ARE BASED IN THE U.S. OR ELSEWHERE.

WE HAVE THOUSANDS OF SUPPLIERS, INCLUDING SUBCONTRACTORS, PROVIDING OUR

VARIOUS MATERIALS AND SERVICE NEEDS. WE SET EXPECTATIONS FOR SUPPLIER PERFORMANCE AND REINFORCE THOSE EXPECTATIONS WITH PERIODIC ASSESSMENTS. WE COMMUNICATE THOSE EXPECTATIONS TO OUR SUPPLIERS REGULARLY AND WORK WITH THEM TO IMPLEMENT IMPROVEMENTS

WHEN NECESSARY. WE SEEK, WHERE POSSIBLE, TO HAVE SEVERAL SOURCES OF SUPPLY FOR ALL OF THESE MATERIALS AND RESOURCES, BUT WE MAY RELY ON A SINGLE OR LIMITED NUMBER OF SUPPLIERS, OR UPON SUPPLIERS IN A SINGLE COUNTRY. IN THOSE CASES, WE DEVELOP AND

IMPLEMENT PLANS AND ACTIONS TO REDUCE THE EXPOSURE THAT WOULD RESULT FROM A DISRUPTION IN SUPPLY. WE ALSO TYPICALLY HAVE MULTIPLE FACTORIES AT VARIOUS SITES AROUND THE WORLD PRODUCING OUR PRODUCTS. HOWEVER, SOME PRODUCTS ARE PRODUCED IN ONLY ONE

FACTORY, AND AGAIN WE SEEK, THROUGH OTHER ACTIONS AND PLANS, TO REDUCE THE EXPOSURE THAT WOULD RESULT FROM A DISRUPTION AT THAT FACTORY.

MANUFACTURING OF INTEGRATED CIRCUITS IS A COMPLEX PROCESS. NORMAL MANUFACTURING RISKS INCLUDE ERRORS AND INTERRUPTIONS IN THE PRODUCTION PROCESS, DEFECTS

IN RAW MATERIALS AND DISRUPTIONS AT SUPPLIERS, AS WELL AS OTHER RISKS, ALL OF WHICH CAN AFFECT THE TIMING OF THE MANUFACTURING RAMP AND YIELDS. A SUBSTANTIAL DECREASE IN YIELDS WOULD RESULT IN HIGHER MANUFACTURING COSTS AND THE POSSIBILITY OF NOT

BEING ABLE TO PRODUCE SUFFICIENT VOLUME TO MEET SPECIFIC PRODUCT DEMAND.

WE OPERATE GLOBALLY, WITH SALES OFFICES AND RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES, AS WELL AS MANUFACTURING AND ASSEMBLY AND TEST FACILITIES, IN MANY COUNTRIES, SO WE ARE SUBJECT TO RISKS AND FACTORS ASSOCIATED WITH

DOING BUSINESS OUTSIDE THE U.S. GLOBAL OPERATIONS INVOLVE INHERENT RISKS THAT INCLUDE CURRENCY CONTROLS AND FLUCTUATIONS, TARIFF AND IMPORT REGULATIONS, AND REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS THAT MAY LIMIT OUR OR OUR CUSTOMERS ABILITY TO MANUFACTURE,

ASSEMBLE AND TEST, DESIGN, DEVELOP OR SELL PRODUCTS IN PARTICULAR COUNTRIES. AS PART OF OUR SITE-SELECTION DUE DILIGENCE PROCESSES, WE EMPLOY ASSESSMENTS OF SEVERAL CRITERIA, WHICH INCLUDE THE PROPERTYS PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS OR

CONSTRUCTABILITY, LOCAL UTILITY INFRASTRUCTURE, TRANSPORTATION CAPABILITY, AVAILABILITY OF TECHNICAL WORKFORCE, CONSTRUCTION AND SUPPLIER CAPABILITIES, PERMITTING REQUIREMENTS AND INVESTMENT CONDITIONS. EMPLOYMENT PRACTICES AND LABOR RIGHTS ISSUES

ARE INCORPORATED IN THE DILIGENCE. EVALUATIONS ALSO INCLUDE RATINGS FOR SECURITY CONCERNS, WHICH INCLUDE CORRUPTION, TERRORISM, CRIME AND POLITICAL INSTABILITY. SECURITY CONCERNS ALONE ARE SUFFICIENT TO REMOVE PROJECTS FROM CONSIDERATION. REGARDLESS

OF THESE EFFORTS, IF TERRORIST ACTIVITY, ARMED CONFLICT, CIVIL OR MILITARY UNREST, OR POLITICAL INSTABILITY OCCURS IN THE U.S., ISRAEL OR OTHER LOCATIONS, SUCH EVENTS MAY DISRUPT PRODUCTION, LOGISTICS, SECURITY AND COMMUNICATIONS, AND COULD ALSO

RESULT IN REDUCED DEMAND FOR INTELS PRODUCTS. THE IMPACT OF MAJOR HEALTH CONCERNS, OR OF LARGE-SCALE OUTAGES OR INTERRUPTIONS OF SERVICE FROM UTILITY OR OTHER INFRASTRUCTURE PROVIDERS, ON INTEL, ITS SUPPLIERS, CUSTOMERS OR OTHER THIRD PARTIES

COULD ALSO ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS AND IMPACT CUSTOMER ORDER PATTERNS. WE COULD ALSO BE AFFECTED IF LABOR ISSUES DISRUPT OUR TRANSPORTATION ARRANGEMENTS OR THOSE OF OUR CUSTOMERS OR SUPPLIERS. ON A WORLDWIDE BASIS, WE REGULARLY REVIEW OUR KEY

INFRASTRUCTURE, SYSTEMS, SERVICES AND SUPPLIERS BOTH INTERNALLY AND EXTERNALLY, TO SEEK TO IDENTIFY SIGNIFICANT VULNERABILITIES AS WELL AS AREAS OF POTENTIAL BUSINESS IMPACT IF A DISRUPTIVE EVENT WERE TO OCCUR. ONCE THEY ARE IDENTIFIED, WE ASSESS

THE RISKS, AND AS WE CONSIDER THEM TO BE APPROPRIATE, WE INITIATE ACTIONS INTENDED TO REDUCE THE RISKS AND THEIR POTENTIAL IMPACT. HOWEVER, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT WE HAVE IDENTIFIED ALL SIGNIFICANT RISKS OR THAT WE CAN MITIGATE ALL

IDENTIFIED RISKS WITH REASONABLE EFFORT.

EMPLOYEES

AS OF DECEMBER 27, 2003, WE EMPLOYED APPROXIMATELY 79,700 PEOPLE WORLDWIDE, WITH APPROXIMATELY 60% OF THESE EMPLOYEES

LOCATED IN THE U.S.

SALES AND MARKETING

IN 2003, WE CONDUCTED BUSINESS WITH MORE THAN 2,000 DIRECT CUSTOMERS

WORLDWIDE. MOST OF OUR PRODUCTS ARE SOLD OR LICENSED THROUGH SALES OFFICES LOCATED NEAR MAJOR CONCENTRATIONS OF USERS, PRIMARILY THROUGHOUT THE AMERICAS, EUROPE, ASIA-PACIFIC AND JAPAN. SALES AGREEMENTS TYPICALLY CONTAIN STANDARD TERMS AND

CONDITIONS COVERING MATTERS SUCH AS PRICING, PAYMENT TERMS AND WARRANTIES, AS WELL AS INDEMNITIES FOR ISSUES SPECIFIC TO OUR PRODUCTS, SUCH AS PATENT AND COPYRIGHT INDEMNITIES. FROM TIME TO TIME WE MAY ENTER INTO ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS WITH CUSTOMERS

COVERING, FOR EXAMPLE, CHANGES FROM OUR STANDARD TERMS AND CONDITIONS, NEW PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT AND MARKETING, PRIVATE-LABEL BRANDING AND OTHER MATTERS. SALES OF PARTICULAR PRODUCTS ARE GENERALLY CONDUCTED WITH PURCHASE ORDERS ISSUED UNDER THE SALES

AGREEMENTS. MOST OF INTELS SALES ARE MADE USING ELECTRONIC AND WEB-BASED PROCESSES THAT ALLOW THE CUSTOMER TO REVIEW INVENTORY AVAILABILITY AND TO TRACK THE PROGRESS OF SPECIFIC GOODS UNDER ORDER. PRICING ON PARTICULAR PRODUCTS MAY VARY BASED

ON VOLUMES ORDERED AND OTHER FACTORS.

WE SELL OUR PRODUCTS

WORLDWIDE DIRECTLY TO ORIGINAL EQUIPMENT MANUFACTURERS (OEMS) AND ORIGINAL DESIGN MANUFACTURERS (ODMS). ODMS PROVIDE DESIGN AND/OR MANUFACTURING SERVICES TO BRANDED AND UNBRANDED PRIVATE-LABEL RESELLERS. WE ALSO SELL OUR PRODUCTS TO INDUSTRIAL AND

RETAIL DISTRIBUTORS. DELL INC. CONTRIBUTED APPROXIMATELY 19% TO OUR TOTAL SALES, AND HEWLETT-PACKARD COMPANY CONTRIBUTED APPROXIMATELY 15% TO OUR TOTAL SALES, IN 2003. A SUBSTANTIAL MAJORITY OF THE SALES TO THESE CUSTOMERS CONSISTED OF INTEL

ARCHITECTURE BUSINESS PRODUCTS. NO OTHER CUSTOMER ACCOUNTED FOR MORE THAN 10% OF OUR TOTAL REVENUE. FOR THE INFORMATION REGARDING REVENUE AND OPERATING PROFIT BY REPORTABLE SEGMENTS AND REVENUE FROM UNAFFILIATED CUSTOMERS BY GEOGRAPHIC

OF THIS FORM 10-K.

TYPICALLY, DISTRIBUTORS HANDLE A WIDE

VARIETY OF PRODUCTS, INCLUDING THOSE THAT COMPETE WITH OUR PRODUCTS, AND FILL ORDERS FOR MANY CUSTOMERS. MOST OF OUR SALES TO DISTRIBUTORS ARE MADE UNDER AGREEMENTS ALLOWING FOR PRICE PROTECTION ON UNSOLD MERCHANDISE AND A RIGHT OF RETURN ON

STIPULATED QUANTITIES OF UNSOLD MERCHANDISE. WE ALSO UTILIZE THIRD-PARTY SALES REPRESENTATIVES WHO GENERALLY DO NOT OFFER DIRECTLY COMPETITIVE PRODUCTS BUT MAY CARRY COMPLEMENTARY ITEMS MANUFACTURED BY OTHERS. SALES REPRESENTATIVES DO NOT MAINTAIN A

PRODUCT INVENTORY; INSTEAD, THEIR CUSTOMERS PLACE ORDERS DIRECTLY WITH US OR THROUGH DISTRIBUTORS.

OUR WORLDWIDE RESELLER SALES CHANNEL CONSISTS OF THOUSANDS OF INDIRECT CUSTOMERS THAT ARE SYSTEMS BUILDERS WHO PURCHASE INTEL MICROPROCESSORS AND OTHER

PRODUCTS FROM OUR DISTRIBUTORS. THESE SYSTEMS BUILDERS RECEIVE VARIOUS LEVELS OF TECHNICAL AND MARKETING SERVICES AND SUPPORT DIRECTLY FROM INTEL. WE HAVE A BOXED PROCESSOR PROGRAM THAT ALLOWS DISTRIBUTORS TO SELL INTEL MICROPROCESSORS

IN SMALL QUANTITIES TO THESE SYSTEMS-BUILDER CUSTOMERS; BOXED PROCESSORS ARE ALSO MADE AVAILABLE IN DIRECT RETAIL OUTLETS. SINCE 1994, OUR WORLDWIDE RESELLER SALES CHANNEL HAS GROWN SUBSTANTIALLY AND HAS BECOME INCREASINGLY IMPORTANT TO OUR

BUSINESS.

OUR GLOBAL MARKETING STRATEGY IS DESIGNED TO

ASSOCIATE OUR BRANDS WITH ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY AND INNOVATION. UNDER THE INTEL

PURCHASES BY CUSTOMERS OFTEN ALLOW THEM TO PARTICIPATE IN COOPERATIVE ADVERTISING AND MARKETING PROGRAMS

SUCH AS THE INTEL INSIDE PROGRAM. THROUGH THE INTEL INSIDE PROGRAM, OEMS ARE LICENSED TO PLACE THE INTEL INSIDE LOGOS ON COMPUTERS WITH OUR MICROPROCESSORS AND OUR OTHER TECHNOLOGY AND USE THE BRANDS IN ADVERTISEMENTS. THE PROGRAM INCLUDES A MARKET

DEVELOPMENT COMPONENT THAT ACCRUES FUNDS BASED ON PURCHASES AND PARTIALLY REIMBURSES THE OEMS FOR ADVERTISEMENTS FOR PRODUCTS FEATURING THE INTEL INSIDE BRAND. THIS PROGRAM BROADENS BRAND REACH BEYOND THE SCOPE OF OUR DIRECT ADVERTISING.

ADDITIONALLY, OUR RESELLER SALES CHANNEL MARKETING PROGRAMS ARE INTENDED

TO EXTEND THE INTEL INSIDE BRAND REACH TO CHANNEL CUSTOMERS AND THE BUSINESSES AND INDIVIDUALS THAT PURCHASE COMPUTER SYSTEMS FROM THEM. IN 2003, WE INITIATED A PROGRAM TO EXTEND THE AWARENESS OF OUR BRAND OUTSIDE OF THE OEM AND SYSTEM INTEGRATOR

COMMUNITY. AS PART OF THE INTEL CENTRINO MOBILE TECHNOLOGY LAUNCH, NEW CO-MARKETING PROGRAMS WERE INITIATED WITH WIRELESS SERVICE PROVIDERS AND AT PUBLIC WIRELESS ACCESS POINT LOCATIONS. NEW CO-MARKETING ACTIVITIES WITH INDEPENDENT SYSTEM VENDORS

ARE ALSO UNDER WAY.

OUR PRODUCTS ARE TYPICALLY SHIPPED UNDER

TERMS THAT TRANSFER TITLE TO THE CUSTOMER, EVEN IN ARRANGEMENTS FOR WHICH THE CUSTOMER MAY HAVE A RIGHT TO RETURN OR TO EXCHANGE THE PRODUCTS AND THE RECOGNITION OF REVENUE ON THE SALE IS DEFERRED. THE SALES AGREEMENTS TYPICALLY PROVIDE THAT PAYMENT

IS DUE AT A LATER DATE, SUCH AS 30 DAYS AFTER SHIPMENT, DELIVERY OR THE CUSTOMERS USE OF THE PRODUCT. OUR CREDIT DEPARTMENT SETS ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND SHIPPING LIMITS FOR INDIVIDUAL CUSTOMERS, FOR THE PURPOSE OF CONTROLLING CREDIT RISK TO

INTEL ARISING FROM OUTSTANDING ACCOUNT BALANCES. WE ASSESS CREDIT RISK THROUGH QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE ANALYSIS, AND FROM THIS ANALYSIS, WE ESTABLISH CREDIT LIMITS AND DETERMINE WHETHER WE WILL SEEK TO USE ONE OR MORE CREDIT SUPPORT DEVICES,

SUCH AS OBTAINING SOME FORM OF THIRD-PARTY GUARANTY OR STANDBY LETTER OF CREDIT, OR OBTAINING CREDIT INSURANCE FOR ALL OR A PORTION OF THE ACCOUNT BALANCE. CREDIT LOSSES MAY STILL BE INCURRED DUE TO BANKRUPTCY, FRAUD OR OTHER FAILURE OF THE CUSTOMER

TO PAY. SEE SCHEDULE IIVALUATION AND QUALIFYING ACCOUNTS ON PAGE 90 OF THIS FORM 10-K FOR INFORMATION ABOUT OUR ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL RECEIVABLES.

BACKLOG

WE DO NOT BELIEVE THAT A BACKLOG AS OF ANY PARTICULAR DATE IS INDICATIVE OF FUTURE RESULTS. OUR SALES ARE MADE PRIMARILY PURSUANT TO STANDARD PURCHASE

ORDERS FOR DELIVERY OF STANDARD PRODUCTS. WE HAVE SOME AGREEMENTS THAT GIVE A CUSTOMER THE RIGHT TO PURCHASE A SPECIFIC NUMBER OF PRODUCTS DURING A SPECIFIED TIME PERIOD. ALTHOUGH THESE AGREEMENTS DO NOT GENERALLY OBLIGATE THE CUSTOMER TO PURCHASE

ANY PARTICULAR NUMBER OF SUCH PRODUCTS, SOME OF THESE AGREEMENTS DO CONTAIN BILLBACK CLAUSES. UNDER THESE CLAUSES, CUSTOMERS WHO DO NOT PURCHASE THE FULL VOLUME AGREED UPON ARE LIABLE FOR BILLBACK ON PREVIOUS SHIPMENTS UP TO THE PRICE APPROPRIATE

FOR THE QUANTITY ACTUALLY PURCHASED. AS A MATTER OF INDUSTRY PRACTICE, BILLBACK CLAUSES ARE DIFFICULT TO ENFORCE. THE QUANTITY ACTUALLY PURCHASED BY THE CUSTOMER, AS WELL AS THE SHIPMENT SCHEDULES, ARE FREQUENTLY REVISED DURING THE AGREEMENT TERM TO

REFLECT CHANGES IN THE CUSTOMERS NEEDS. IN LIGHT OF INDUSTRY PRACTICE AND OUR EXPERIENCE, WE DO NOT BELIEVE THAT SUCH AGREEMENTS ARE MEANINGFUL FOR DETERMINING BACKLOG AMOUNTS. WE BELIEVE THAT ONLY A SMALL PORTION OF OUR ORDER BACKLOG IS

NON-CANCELABLE AND THAT THE DOLLAR AMOUNT ASSOCIATED WITH THE NON-CANCELABLE PORTION IS NOT SIGNIFICANT.

COMPETITION

AS PART OF

OUR OVERALL STRATEGY TO COMPETE IN EACH RELEVANT MARKET SEGMENT, WE USE OUR CORE COMPETENCIES IN THE DESIGN AND MANUFACTURE OF INTEGRATED CIRCUITS AND FINANCIAL RESOURCES, AS WELL AS OUR GLOBAL PRESENCE AND BRAND RECOGNITION. ALSO, UNDER OUR INTEL

CAPITAL PROGRAM WE MAKE EQUITY INVESTMENTS IN COMPANIES AROUND THE WORLD TO FURTHER OUR STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES AND SUPPORT OUR KEY BUSINESS INITIATIVES. OUR PRODUCTS COMPETE, TO VARIOUS DEGREES, ON THE BASIS OF PERFORMANCE, QUALITY, FEATURES THAT

ENHANCE USER EXPERIENCE, BRAND RECOGNITION, PRICE AND AVAILABILITY. OUR ABILITY TO COMPETE ALSO DEPENDS UPON OUR ABILITY TO PROVIDE WORLDWIDE SUPPORT FOR OUR CUSTOMERS. RAPID TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES CHARACTERIZE THE COMPUTING AND COMMUNICATIONS

INDUSTRIES, AND OUR ABILITY TO COMPETE DEPENDS ON OUR ABILITY TO IMPROVE OUR PRODUCTS AND PROCESSES FASTER THAN OUR COMPETITORS, ANTICIPATE CHANGING CUSTOMER REQUIREMENTS, AND DEVELOP AND LAUNCH NEW PRODUCTS TO MEET CHANGING REQUIREMENTS, WHILE

REDUCING OUR COSTS AT THE SAME TIME. OUR PRODUCTS COMPETE WITH PRODUCTS DEVELOPED FOR SIMILAR OR RIVAL ARCHITECTURES AND WITH PRODUCTS BASED ON THE SAME OR RIVAL TECHNOLOGY STANDARDS. OUR COMPETITORS ALSO ROUTINELY ADD FEATURES TO THEIR PRODUCTS,

SEEK TO INCREASE THE PERFORMANCE OF THEIR PRODUCTS AND/OR SELL THEIR PRODUCTS AT LOWER PRICES OVER TIME. WE CANNOT PREDICT WHETHER OUR PRODUCTS WILL CONTINUE TO COMPETE SUCCESSFULLY WITH EXISTING RIVAL ARCHITECTURES AND/OR WHETHER NEW ARCHITECTURES

WILL ESTABLISH OR GAIN BROAD ACCEPTANCE OR INCREASE COMPETITION WITH OUR PRODUCTS. WE ALSO CANNOT PREDICT WHICH COMPETING TECHNOLOGY STANDARDS WILL BECOME THE PREVAILING STANDARDS IN THE MARKET SEGMENTS IN WHICH WE COMPETE.

IN THE SEMICONDUCTOR INDUSTRY, AS UNIT VOLUMES GROW, PRODUCTION EXPERIENCE IS

ACCUMULATED AND COSTS DECREASE, FURTHER COMPETITION DEVELOPS, AND AS A RESULT, PRICES DECLINE RAPIDLY. THE LIFE CYCLE OF OUR PRODUCTS IS VERY SHORT, SOMETIMES LESS THAN A YEAR. MANY COMPANIES COMPETE WITH US IN THE VARIOUS COMPUTING, NETWORKING AND

COMMUNICATIONS MARKET SEGMENTS, AND ARE ENGAGED IN THE SAME BASIC FIELDS OF ACTIVITY, INCLUDING RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT. WORLDWIDE, THESE COMPETITORS RANGE IN SIZE FROM LARGE ESTABLISHED

MULTINATIONAL COMPANIES WITH MULTIPLE PRODUCT LINES TO SMALLER COMPANIES AND NEW ENTRANTS TO THE MARKETPLACE THAT COMPETE IN SPECIALIZED MARKET SEGMENTS. IN

SOME CASES, OUR COMPETITORS ARE ALSO OUR CUSTOMERS AND/OR SUPPLIERS. SOME COMPETITORS HAVE INTEGRATED OPERATIONS, INCLUDING THEIR OWN MANUFACTURING FACILITIES, WHILE OTHER COMPETITORS PERFORM CERTAIN FUNCTIONS THEMSELVES AND OUTSOURCE DESIGN,

MANUFACTURING AND/OR OTHER FUNCTIONS. COMPETITORS WHO OUTSOURCE THEIR MANUFACTURING CAN SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE THEIR CAPITAL EXPENDITURES.

WITH THE TREND TOWARD CONVERGENCE IN COMPUTING AND COMMUNICATIONS PRODUCTS, PRODUCT OFFERINGS WILL LIKELY CROSS OVER INTO MULTIPLE CATEGORIES, OFFERING US

NEW OPPORTUNITIES, BUT ALSO RESULTING IN MORE BUSINESSES THAT COMPETE WITH US. COMPETITION TENDS TO INCREASE PRICING PRESSURE ON OUR PRODUCTS, WHICH MAY MEAN THAT WE MUST OFFER OUR PRODUCTS AT LOWER PRICES THAN WE HAD ANTICIPATED, RESULTING IN LOWER

PROFITS. IN MARKETS WHERE OUR COMPETITORS HAVE ESTABLISHED PRODUCTS AND BRAND RECOGNITION, IT MAY BE INHERENTLY DIFFICULT FOR US TO COMPETE AGAINST THEM. WHEN WE BELIEVE IT IS APPROPRIATE, WE WILL TAKE VARIOUS STEPS, INCLUDING INTRODUCING NEW

PRODUCTS, DISCONTINUING OLDER PRODUCTS, REDUCING PRICES, AND OFFERING REBATES AND OTHER INCENTIVES IN ORDER TO INCREASE ACCEPTANCE OF OUR LATEST PRODUCTS AND TO BE COMPETITIVE WITHIN EACH RELEVANT MARKET SEGMENT.

MOST OF OUR PRODUCTS, INCLUDING ALL OF OUR INTEL ARCHITECTURE MICROPROCESSORS

AND CHIPSETS, ARE BUILT IN OUR OWN MANUFACTURING FACILITIES, ALTHOUGH A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF ICGS MANUFACTURING IS PERFORMED BY THIRD-PARTY MANUFACTURERS. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR NETWORK OF MANUFACTURING FACILITIES AND ASSEMBLY/TEST FACILITIES

GIVES US A COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE. THIS NETWORK ENABLES US TO HAVE MORE DIRECT CONTROL OVER OUR PROCESSES, QUALITY CONTROL, PRODUCT COST, VOLUME AND TIMING OF PRODUCTION AND OTHER FACTORS. THESE TYPES OF FACILITIES ARE VERY EXPENSIVE, AND MANY OF OUR

COMPETITORS DO NOT OWN SUCH FACILITIES BECAUSE THEY CANNOT AFFORD TO DO SO OR BECAUSE THEIR BUSINESS MODELS INVOLVE THE USE OF THIRD-PARTY FACILITIES FOR MANUFACTURING AND ASSEMBLY/TEST. THESE FABLESS SEMICONDUCTOR COMPANIES INCLUDE

BROADCOM CORPORATION, NVIDIA CORPORATION, QUALCOMM INCORPORATED, AND VIA TECHNOLOGIES, INC. SOME OF OUR COMPETITORS OWN PORTIONS OF SUCH FACILITIES THROUGH INVESTMENT OR JOINT-VENTURE ARRANGEMENTS WITH OTHER COMPANIES. THERE IS A GROUP OF

THIRD-PARTY MANUFACTURING AND ASSEMBLY/TEST COMPANIES (FOUNDRIES) THAT OFFER THEIR SERVICES TO COMPANIES WITHOUT OWNED FACILITIES OR COMPANIES NEEDING ADDITIONAL CAPACITY. THESE FOUNDRIES MAY ALSO OFFER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, DESIGN SERVICES, AND

OTHER GOODS AND SERVICES TO OUR COMPETITORS.

MANY OF OUR

COMPETITORS ARE LICENSED TO USE OUR PATENTS, AND WE ARE LICENSED TO USE THEIR PATENTS, THROUGH VARIOUS CROSS-LICENSING AGREEMENTS. SOME COMPETITORS HAVE BROAD LICENSES WITH US, AND UNDER CURRENT CASE LAW, SUCH LICENSES PERMIT THESE COMPETITORS TO

PASS OUR PATENT RIGHTS ON TO OTHERS. IF ONE OF THESE LICENSEES BECOMES A FOUNDRY, OUR COMPETITORS MIGHT BE ABLE TO AVOID OUR PATENT RIGHTS IN MANUFACTURING COMPETING PRODUCTS.

WE PLAN TO CONTINUE TO CULTIVATE NEW BUSINESSES AND WORK WITH THE COMPUTING, COMMUNICATIONS AND CONSUMER ELECTRONICS

INDUSTRIES THROUGH STANDARDS BODIES, TRADE ASSOCIATIONS, OEMS, ODMS, AND INDEPENDENT SOFTWARE AND OPERATING SYSTEM VENDORS, TO ALIGN THE INDUSTRY TO OFFER PRODUCTS THAT TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE LATEST MARKET TRENDS AND USAGE MODELS. THESE EFFORTS

INCLUDE HELPING TO CREATE THE INFRASTRUCTURE FOR WIRELESS NETWORK CONNECTIVITY. WE ARE ALSO WORKING WITH THE INDUSTRY TO DEVELOP SOFTWARE APPLICATIONS AND OPERATING SYSTEMS THAT TAKE ADVANTAGE OF OUR MICROPROCESSORS, CHIPSETS AND OTHER

NEXT-GENERATION SEMICONDUCTOR DEVICES WITH HIGHER PERFORMANCE OR ADVANCED FEATURES, INCLUDING ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY CAPABILITIES INTEGRATED AT THE SILICON LEVEL. WE FREQUENTLY PARTICIPATE IN INDUSTRY INITIATIVES DESIGNED TO DISCUSS AND AGREE UPON

TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS AND OTHER ASPECTS OF TECHNOLOGIES THAT COULD BE ADOPTED AS STANDARDS BY STANDARDS-SETTING ORGANIZATIONS. OUR COMPETITORS MAY ALSO PARTICIPATE IN THE SAME INITIATIVES, AND OUR PARTICIPATION DOES NOT ENSURE THAT ANY STANDARDS

OR SPECIFICATIONS ADOPTED BY THESE ORGANIZATIONS WILL BE CONSISTENT WITH OUR PRODUCT PLANNING. PARTICIPATION IN SUCH INITIATIVES MAY REQUIRE US TO LICENSE OUR PATENTS TO OTHER COMPANIES THAT ADOPT THE STANDARDS OR SPECIFICATIONS, EVEN WHEN SUCH

ORGANIZATIONS DO NOT ADOPT STANDARDS OR SPECIFICATIONS PROPOSED BY INTEL. ANY INTEL PATENTS IMPLICATED BY OUR PARTICIPATION IN SUCH INITIATIVES MIGHT NOT BE AVAILABLE FOR US TO ENFORCE AGAINST OTHERS WHO MIGHT BE INFRINGING THOSE PATENTS.

WE COMPETE GLOBALLY IN ALL OF THE MARKET SEGMENTS IN WHICH WE

OFFER PRODUCTS. WE CANNOT BE ASSURED THAT THE PATENTS AND LICENSES ON OUR PRODUCTS WILL BE HONORED IN ALL REGIONS. AS VARIOUS GEOGRAPHIES BECOME MORE SIGNIFICANT TO OUR BUSINESS, WE CANNOT BE SURE OF THE SCOPE OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS THAT

WILL BE GRANTED TO US OR TO THIRD PARTIES WITH WHOM WE DO NOT HAVE LICENSES. THUS, WE HAVE NO ASSURANCE ABOUT THE SCOPE OF RIGHTS THAT WE CAN ENFORCE AGAINST OTHERS IN VARIOUS GEOGRAPHIES WHERE OUR BUSINESS IS GROWING OR THE RIGHTS THAT THEY CAN

ASSERT AGAINST US. IN ADDITION, IN CERTAIN REGIONS, GOVERNMENTS MAY ADOPT REGULATIONS OR COURTS MAY RENDER DECISIONS REQUIRING COMPULSORY LICENSING OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY TO OTHERS, OR REQUIRING THAT PRODUCTS MEET SPECIFIED STANDARDS THAT SERVE TO

FAVOR LOCAL COMPANIES, NEGATIVELY IMPACTING INTELS ABILITY TO ACHIEVE AN ECONOMIC RETURN FOR ITS INNOVATION AND INVESTMENT.

INTEL ARCHITECTURE BUSINESS

FOR THE DESKTOP PLATFORM, OUR STRATEGY IS TO INTRODUCE MICROPROCESSORS AND CHIPSETS WITH HIGHER PERFORMANCE AND/OR ADVANCED

TECHNOLOGY FEATURES, TAILORED TO THE NEEDS OF DIFFERENT MARKET SEGMENTS USING A TIERED BRANDING APPROACH. FOR THE MOBILE PLATFORM, OUR STRATEGY IS TO DELIVER PRODUCTS OPTIMIZED FOR SOME OR ALL OF THE FOUR MOBILITY VECTORS: PERFORMANCE, BATTERY LIFE,

FORM FACTOR AND WIRELESS CONNECTIVITY. FOR THE ENTERPRISE PLATFORM, OUR STRATEGY IS TO PROVIDE PROCESSORS AND CHIPSETS WITH HIGH PERFORMANCE AND/OR ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY FEATURES, AS WELL AS COMPETITIVE PRICE FOR PERFORMANCE FOR ENTRY-LEVEL TO

HIGH-END SERVERS AND WORKSTATIONS.

OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS ARE

SUBSTANTIALLY DEPENDENT ON MICROPROCESSOR SALES BY THE INTEL ARCHITECTURE OPERATING SEGMENT. MANY OF OUR COMPETITORS (INCLUDING ADVANCED MICRO DEVICES, INC. (AMD), OUR PRIMARY MICROPROCESSOR COMPETITOR) MARKET SOFTWARE-COMPATIBLE PRODUCTS THAT ARE

INTENDED TO COMPETE WITH INTEL ARCHITECTURE-BASED PROCESSORS. WE ALSO FACE COMPETITION FROM COMPANIES OFFERING RIVAL MICROPROCESSOR DESIGNS, SUCH AS INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS MACHINES CORPORATION (IBM), WHICH SUPPLIES MICROPROCESSORS TO APPLE COMPUTER,

INC. AMD HAS INTRODUCED MICROPROCESSOR PRODUCT OFFERINGS FOR THE DESKTOP AND SERVER MARKET SEGMENTS THAT ARE BASED ON 32-BIT ARCHITECTURE WITH 64-BIT MEMORY ADDRESS EXTENSIONS. MICROPROCESSORS WITH 64-BIT ADDRESSING CAPABILITY CAN ADDRESS

SIGNIFICANTLY MORE MEMORY THAN 32-BIT MICROPROCESSORS. WE CURRENTLY HAVE DESKTOP AND SERVER MICROPROCESSOR PRODUCT OFFERINGS BASED ON OUR IA-32 ARCHITECTURE, AND WE OFFER THE INTEL ITANIUM PROCESSOR FAMILY, BASED ON 64-BIT ARCHITECTURE, FOR

ENTERPRISE-CLASS SERVERS AND SUPERCOMPUTING SOLUTIONS. WE BELIEVE THAT THE FEATURES OF THE ITANIUM ARCHITECTURE, INCLUDING HIGH-END PERFORMANCE, SCALABILITY, 64-BIT ADDRESSING AND RELIABILITY, PROVIDE CAPABILITIES THAT USERS IN THIS MARKET SEGMENT

REQUIRE. WE PLAN TO INTRODUCE INTEL XEON PROCESSORS BASED ON THE IA-32 ARCHITECTURE WITH 64-BIT EXTENSION TECHNOLOGY FOR WORKSTATIONS AND SERVERS IN MID-2004. WE CONTINUOUSLY EVALUATE ALL OF OUR PRODUCT OFFERINGS AND THE TIMING OF THEIR

INTRODUCTION, TAKING INTO ACCOUNT FACTORS SUCH AS CUSTOMER REQUIREMENTS, AVAILABILITY OF INFRASTRUCTURE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF PRODUCT FEATURES AND MATURITY OF APPLICATIONS SOFTWARE FOR EACH TYPE OF PROCESSOR IN THE RELEVANT MARKET SEGMENTS. ANY

DECISION TO MAKE MICROPROCESSORS WITH 64-BIT EXTENSION TECHNOLOGY AVAILABLE IN THE DESKTOP OR OTHER MARKET SEGMENTS WILL BE BASED ON BOTH TIMING OF AVAILABILITY OF THE INFRASTRUCTURE (INCLUDING AN OPERATING SYSTEM GEARED TOWARD CONSUMERS) REQUIRED

TO SUPPORT THEM AND DEMAND FOR THESE PROCESSORS FROM OUR OEM CUSTOMERS.

COMPETITIVE PRODUCT OFFERINGS CONTINUE TO INCREASE IN THE MARKET SEGMENTS WHERE WE HAVE PRODUCT OFFERINGS. OUR DESKTOP PROCESSORS COMPETE WITH PRODUCTS OFFERED BY AMD, IBM AND VIA, AMONG OTHERS. OUR MOBILE MICROPROCESSOR PRODUCTS COMPETE

WITH PRODUCTS OFFERED BY AMD, IBM, TRANSMETA CORPORATION AND VIA, AMONG OTHERS. OUR SERVER PROCESSORS COMPETE WITH SOFTWARE-COMPATIBLE PRODUCTS OFFERED BY AMD AND WITH ESTABLISHED PRODUCTS BASED ON RIVAL ARCHITECTURES, INCLUDING THOSE OFFERED BY

HEWLETT-PACKARD COMPANY, IBM AND SUN MICROSYSTEMS, INC. OUR CHIPSETS COMPETE IN THE VARIOUS MARKET SEGMENTS AGAINST DIFFERENT TYPES OF CHIPSETS THAT SUPPORT EITHER OUR MICROPROCESSOR PRODUCTS OR RIVAL MICROPROCESSOR PRODUCTS. COMPETING CHIPSETS ARE

PRODUCED BY COMPANIES SUCH AS ATI TECHNOLOGIES, INC., BROADCOM, NVIDIA, SILICON INTEGRATED SYSTEMS CORPORATION (SIS) AND VIA. WE ALSO COMPETE WITH COMPANIES OFFERING GRAPHICS COMPONENTS AND OTHER SPECIAL-PURPOSE PRODUCTS USED IN THE DESKTOP, MOBILE

AND SERVER MARKET SEGMENTS. ONE ASPECT OF OUR BUSINESS MODEL IS TO INCORPORATE HIGHER PERFORMANCE AND ADVANCED FEATURES INTO THE MICROPROCESSOR AND CHIPSET, THE DEMAND FOR WHICH MAY INCREASINGLY BE AFFECTED BY COMPETITION FROM COMPANIES (SUCH AS

NVIDIA AND ATI) WHOSE BUSINESS MODELS ARE BASED ON INCORPORATING PERFORMANCE AND ADVANCED FEATURES INTO CHIPSETS AND OTHER COMPONENTS (SUCH AS GRAPHICS CONTROLLERS).

INTEL COMMUNICATIONS GROUP

WITHIN ICG, OUR STRATEGY IS TO BE THE LEADING SUPPLIER OF SILICON AND INTEGRATED NETWORKING AND COMMUNICATIONS BUILDING

BLOCKS FOR OEMS AND OTHER SYSTEMS BUILDERS. WE ARE DEVELOPING PRODUCTS THAT WE BELIEVE WILL HELP TO BUILD OUT THE INTERNET: PRODUCTS DESIGNED FOR WIRED AND WIRELESS CONNECTIVITY, COMMUNICATIONS INFRASTRUCTURE AND NETWORKED STORAGE. IN THESE AREAS,

WE FACE COMPETITION FROM BOTH ESTABLISHED AND EMERGING COMPANIES. OUR PRODUCTS CURRENTLY COMPETE AGAINST OFFERINGS FROM COMPANIES SUCH AS APPLIED MICRO CIRCUITS CORPORATION, BROADCOM, GLOBESPAN VIRATA, INC., IBM, MARVELL TECHNOLOGY CO. LTD. AND

TEXAS INSTRUMENTS INCORPORATED. INTEL AND MANY OF OUR COMPETITORS ACQUIRE ALTERNATIVE TECHNOLOGIES AND PRODUCTS FROM OTHER COMPANIES IN AN EFFORT TO ACHIEVE LEADING-EDGE MARKET SEGMENT POSITIONS. CERTAIN MARKET SEGMENTS IN WHICH ICG MAY COMPETE,

SUCH AS NETWORKING AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS PRODUCTS, HAVE EXPERIENCED AN OVERALL ECONOMIC DECLINE. THESE MARKET CONDITIONS HAVE RESULTED IN INCREASED COMPETITION FOR THE REMAINING AVAILABLE BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES. WE CANNOT PREDICT WHETHER OUR

NETWORKING AND COMMUNICATIONS PRODUCTS WILL CONTINUE TO COMPETE SUCCESSFULLY WITH THOSE OF OUR EXISTING COMPETITORS OR NEW MARKET ENTRANTS.

WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS AND COMPUTING GROUP

WITHIN WCCG, OUR CURRENT PRODUCTS INCLUDE FLASH MEMORY, APPLICATION AND

CELLULAR PROCESSORS BASED ON THE INTEL XSCALE MICROARCHITECTURE, AND CELLULAR BASEBAND CHIPSETS. IN OUR VARIOUS MARKET SEGMENTS, OUR PRODUCTS CURRENTLY COMPETE WITH THE PRODUCTS OF OTHER COMPANIES, SUCH AS FASL LLC (A JOINT VENTURE BETWEEN FUJITSU

LIMITED AND AMD), QUALCOMM, SAMSUNG SEMICONDUCTOR INC., ST MICROELECTRONICS GROUP AND TEXAS INSTRUMENTS. THE MEGABIT DEMAND OF THE PRODUCTS THAT MAKE USE OF FLASH MEMORY IS INCREASING, AND OUR NOR FLASH MEMORY PRODUCTS MAY FACE INCREASED COMPETITION

FROM COMPANIES THAT MANUFACTURE NAND FLASH PRODUCTS, AS OEMS MAY LOOK FOR OPPORTUNITIES TO USE NAND FLASH PRODUCTS WITH ADDITIONAL RANDOM ACCESS MEMORY OR IN COMBINATION WITH NOR FLASH MEMORY FOR EXECUTABLE-CODE APPLICATIONS. VARIOUS DIGITAL

CELLULAR TECHNOLOGIES ARE USED THROUGHOUT THE CELLULAR COMMUNICATIONS INDUSTRY, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO GSM (GLOBAL SYSTEM FOR MOBILE COMMUNICATIONS), GPRS (GENERAL PACKET RADIO SERVICE), CDMA (CODE DIVISION MULTIPLE ACCESS) AND WCDMA (WIDEBAND

CDMA). OUR ABILITY TO COMPETE SUCCESSFULLY WITH OUR CELLULAR BASEBAND CHIPSETS IS DEPENDENT ON HAVING PRODUCTS AVAILABLE FOR THE MOST PREVALENT OR WIDELY ADOPTED DIGITAL CELLULAR TECHNOLOGY. OUR CURRENT PRODUCT OFFERINGS ARE FOR USE IN CELL PHONES

AND PDAS THAT INCORPORATE THE GSM/GPRS CELLULAR TECHNOLOGIES. OUR PRODUCTS PLANNED FOR RELEASE IN 2004 WILL BE TARGETED FOR THE WCDMA AS WELL AS GSM/GPRS CELLULAR TECHNOLOGIES.

RESEARCH

AND DEVELOPMENT

OUR CONTINUED EMPHASIS ON RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT (R&D) HAS ENABLED US TO BE A LEADER IN OUR INDUSTRY, PARTICULARLY IN THE AREA OF THE DESIGN AND

MANUFACTURE OF INTEGRATED CIRCUITS. MUCH OF OUR R&D EFFORTS HAVE BEEN CENTERED ON ACCELERATING THE CONVERGENCE OF COMPUTING AND COMMUNICATIONS, PRIMARILY THROUGH SILICON INTEGRATION AS WELL AS THROUGH INDUSTRY COLLABORATION, ENABLING US TO

DELIVER LEADING-EDGE TECHNOLOGIES AND PERMITTING OUR CUSTOMERS TO COMMIT TO THE USE OF THESE NEW TECHNOLOGIES IN THE DEVELOPMENT AND EXPANSION OF THEIR OWN PRODUCT OFFERINGS. SPECIFICALLY, OUR R&D ACTIVITIES ARE DIRECTED TOWARD DEVELOPING NEW

SILICON-LEVEL PRODUCTS AND ARCHITECTURES; ADVANCED COMPUTING, COMMUNICATIONS AND WIRELESS TECHNOLOGIES; AND NEW MANUFACTURING, PACKAGING AND TESTING PROCESSES; AS WELL AS IMPROVING EXISTING PRODUCTS AND LOWERING COSTS. IN ADDITION, WE BELIEVE WE ARE

WELL POSITIONED IN THE TECHNOLOGY INDUSTRY TO HELP DRIVE INNOVATION, FOSTER COLLABORATION AND PROMOTE INDUSTRY STANDARDS THAT WILL YIELD INNOVATIVE AND IMPROVED TECHNOLOGIES FOR END USERS.

OUR R&D MODEL IS BASED ON A GLOBAL, DECENTRALIZED ORGANIZATION THAT

EMPHASIZES A COLLABORATIVE APPROACH IN IDENTIFYING AND DEVELOPING NEW TECHNOLOGIES, LEADING STANDARDS INITIATIVES AND INFLUENCING REGULATORY POLICY TO ACCELERATE THE ADOPTION OF NEW TECHNOLOGIES. OUR CORPORATE TECHNOLOGY GROUP (CTG) STRIVES TO ALIGN

OUR R&D INITIATIVES ACROSS OUR BUSINESS GROUPS TO MEET OUR LONG-TERM GOALS. IN ADDITION, CTG WORKS WITH A DECENTRALIZED WORLDWIDE NETWORK OF RESEARCHERS, SCIENTISTS AND ENGINEERS IN THE COMPUTING AND COMMUNICATIONS FIELDS. A DECENTRALIZED

NETWORK OF TECHNOLOGY PROFESSIONALS ALLOWS US, AS WELL AS OTHERS IN OUR INDUSTRY, TO BENEFIT FROM DEVELOPMENT INITIATIVES IN A VARIETY OF AREAS, EVENTUALLY LEADING TO INNOVATIVE TECHNOLOGIES FOR END USERS. WE VIEW TECHNOLOGY STANDARDS AS AN

IMPORTANT WAY TO ADVANCE NEW TECHNOLOGIES AND FOSTER INDUSTRY INFRASTRUCTURES OR ECOSYSTEMS. WE THEREFORE WORK WITH INDUSTRY, GOVERNMENT AND EDUCATION SECTORS IN VARIOUS AREAS TO HELP ESTABLISH TECHNOLOGY STANDARDS, ULTIMATELY INCORPORATING MANY OF

THESE STANDARDS INTO OUR OWN PRODUCT OFFERINGS.

WE PERFORM A

SUBSTANTIAL MAJORITY OF OUR DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT OF SEMICONDUCTOR COMPONENTS AND OTHER PRODUCTS IN THE U.S. OUTSIDE THE U.S., WE HAVE BEEN INCREASING OUR PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES AT VARIOUS LOCATIONS, INCLUDING ISRAEL, MALAYSIA, INDIA, CHINA

AND RUSSIA. WE ALSO MAINTAIN R&D FACILITIES IN THE U.S. THAT ARE FOCUSED ON DEVELOPING AND IMPROVING MANUFACTURING PROCESSES, AS WELL AS FACILITIES IN THE U.S., MALAYSIA AND THE PHILIPPINES THAT ARE DEDICATED TO IMPROVEMENTS IN ASSEMBLY AND TEST

PROCESSES.

AS DEVICES TAKE ADVANTAGE OF CONVERGED COMPUTING

AND COMMUNICATIONS CAPABILITIES, OUR GOAL IS TO CONTINUE TO DELIVER PROCESSORS WITH HIGHER PERFORMANCE AND/OR ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY FEATURES SUCH AS HT TECHNOLOGY AND FEATURES OFFERED WITH OUR INTEL CENTRINO MOBILE TECHNOLOGY. DURING 2003, WE EXPANDED

HT TECHNOLOGY FROM OUR SERVER PRODUCT LINES TO OUR DESKTOP AND MOBILE TRANSPORTABLE PRODUCT LINES. WE ALSO CONTINUED R&D ACTIVITIES IN SUPPORT OF INTEL CENTRINO MOBILE TECHNOLOGY. IN SEPTEMBER 2003, WE ANNOUNCED OUR INTENTION TO INTRODUCE A NEW

MOBILE PLATFORM, BASED ON INTEL CENTRINO MOBILE TECHNOLOGY, IN THE SECOND HALF OF 2004. THIS NEW MOBILE PLATFORM IS EXPECTED TO INCORPORATE A FUTURE VERSION OF THE PENTIUM M PROCESSOR AND A NEW CHIPSET, AS WELL AS INTEGRATE 802.11 A/B/G WIRELESS LAN

CAPABILITY, ENABLING FASTER WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS AND SUPPORT FOR INDUSTRY-STANDARD SECURITY SOLUTIONS.

IN ADDITION TO THE MULTITHREADING OR MULTITASKING CAPABILITY FOUND IN HT TECHNOLOGY AND THE ENHANCED MOBILE COMPUTING FEATURES OFFERED WITH INTEL CENTRINO

MOBILE TECHNOLOGY, WE BELIEVE THAT SYSTEM SECURITY, RELIABILITY AND MANAGEABILITY FEATURES AT THE HARDWARE LEVEL WILL PROVIDE AN ENHANCED COMPUTING EXPERIENCE FOR END USERS, AND WE ARE CURRENTLY WORKING ON NEW TECHNOLOGIES TO MEET THESE NEEDS. WE

ARE DESIGNING TECHNOLOGY INTENDED TO PROVIDE FUTURE SECURITY ENHANCEMENTS FOR OUR PROCESSORS, CHIPSETS AND PLATFORMS. THIS TECHNOLOGY, WHEN COMBINED WITH OPTIMIZED SOFTWARE, WILL HELP PROTECT AGAINST SOFTWARE-BASED ATTACKS ON COMPUTER SYSTEMS. WE

ARE ALSO

INDEX TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

DESIGNING TECHNOLOGY INTENDED TO ENABLE MULTIPLE, INDEPENDENT SOFTWARE ENVIRONMENTS IN A SINGLE PC, IMPROVING THE END-USER EXPERIENCE BY INCREASING SYSTEM

RELIABILITY, FLEXIBILITY AND RESPONSIVENESS, AS WELL AS SPEEDING THE ABILITY TO RECOVER FROM COMPUTER CRASHES.

WE BELIEVE THAT TECHNOLOGY-INDUSTRY PRODUCT DEVELOPMENTS AND THE CONVERGENCE OF COMPUTING AND COMMUNICATIONS SHOULD INCREASE DEMAND FOR OUR HIGHER

PERFORMANCE ENTERPRISE PLATFORM PRODUCTS. IN PARTICULAR, WE ANTICIPATE INCREASED DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS TO SUPPORT NEW DEVELOPMENTS IN DATA TRAFFIC MANAGEMENT, STORAGE, AND WIRELESS COMPUTING AND COMMUNICATIONS NEEDS. IN LINE WITH THIS BELIEF, WE

CONTINUED OUR DEVELOPMENT INITIATIVES AROUND ENTERPRISE PLATFORM PRODUCTS, AND IN SEPTEMBER 2003, WE DISCLOSED DETAILS OF AN UPCOMING INTEL XEON PROCESSOR THAT WILL CONTAIN A DUAL CORE ON ONE CHIP (TWO MICROPROCESSORS ON THE SAME CHIP). WE ALSO PLAN

TO MAKE THE INTEL ITANIUM 2 PROCESSOR AVAILABLE WITH MULTIPLE CORES.

OUR LEADERSHIP IN SILICON TECHNOLOGY HAS ALLOWED US TO CONTINUE TO HELP EXTEND MOORES LAW (DOUBLING THE NUMBER OF TRANSISTORS ON A CHIP EVERY COUPLE OF YEARS), INCREASING PERFORMANCE WHILE REDUCING MANUFACTURING COSTS, AND

ALSO TO HELP EXPAND MOORES LAW, BRINGING NEW CAPABILITIES INTO SILICON AND PRODUCING NEW PRODUCTS OPTIMIZED FOR A WIDER VARIETY OF APPLICATIONS. WE ARE CURRENTLY MANUFACTURING MICROPROCESSORS USING THE 90-NANOMETER PROCESS TECHNOLOGY. OUR

90-NANOMETER PROCESS TECHNOLOGY COMBINES THE USE OF STRAINED SILICON AND COPPER INTERCONNECTS THAT HAVE INTEGRATED ADVANCED MATERIALS (CARBON-DOPED OXIDE DIELECTRIC MATERIAL). BY USING STRAINED SILICON, ELECTRICAL CURRENT IS ABLE TO FLOW MORE

SMOOTHLY, INCREASING THE SPEED OF TRANSISTORS. THE COPPER INTERCONNECTS INTEGRATED WITH THESE ADVANCED MATERIALS ALLOW FOR INCREASED SIGNAL SPEED AND REDUCED POWER CONSUMPTION. WE ALSO CONTINUE TO WORK ON INCORPORATING COMMUNICATIONS CAPABILITIES

INTO OUR 90-NANOMETER MANUFACTURING PROCESS. THESE CAPABILITIES INCLUDE THE USE OF HIGH-SPEED TRANSISTORS AND MIXED-SIGNAL CIRCUITRY, AIMED AT PRODUCING FASTER, MORE INTEGRATED AND LESS COSTLY COMMUNICATIONS CHIPS. IN 2003, WE ANNOUNCED

PLANS TO CONVERT AND BUILD MANUFACTURING FACILITIES TO BEGIN DEVELOPMENT OF OUR NEXT-GENERATION 65-NANOMETER MANUFACTURING PROCESS. WE EXPECT TO BEGIN MANUFACTURING PRODUCTS USING 65-NANOMETER PROCESS TECHNOLOGY IN 2005.

WE ALSO HAVE R&D INITIATIVES IN OTHER WIRELESS, NETWORKING AND

COMMUNICATIONS PRODUCT AREAS. FOR WIRELESS DEVICES, WE HAVE DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS SURROUNDING THE INTEL PCA ARCHITECTURE. THE INTEL PCA ARCHITECTURE IS OUR DEVELOPMENT BLUEPRINT FOR DESIGNING WIRELESS HANDHELD COMMUNICATIONS DEVICES THAT COMBINE

VOICE COMMUNICATIONS AND INTERNET ACCESS CAPABILITIES. DEVELOPMENT INITIATIVES AROUND INTEL PCA INCLUDE PROCESSOR DESIGN BASED ON THE INTEL XSCALE TECHNOLOGY, DIGITAL SIGNAL PROCESSING CORE DEVELOPMENT, IMPROVED PACKAGING FORMATS AND OTHER

COMMUNICATIONS INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY. IN THE LONGER TERM, OUR WIRELESS R&D EFFORTS ARE ANTICIPATED TO ENCOMPASS A WIDE ARRAY OF ACTIVITIES RANGING FROM RF (RADIO FREQUENCY) CIRCUIT AND ADAPTIVE RADIO ARCHITECTURE DESIGNS TO GLOBAL COMMUNICATIONS

STANDARDS ADVOCACY AND REGULATORY POLICY REFORM. THESE EFFORTS SEEK TO HELP MAKE WIRELESS CONNECTIVITY UBIQUITOUS BY INTEGRATING RADIO CAPABILITY INTO OUR PROCESSORS AND CHIPSETS.

FOR NETWORKING AND COMMUNICATIONS PRODUCTS, WE HAVE FOCUSED OUR DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS ON WIRELESS TECHNOLOGIES BASED ON NEW

GENERATIONS OF 802.11 INDUSTRY STANDARDS, AND THESE EFFORTS HAVE LED TO HIGHER PERFORMANCE ETHERNET CONNECTIVITY PRODUCTS. WE ARE WORKING TO DEVELOP SILICON BASED ON THE IEEE 802.16D STANDARD (ALSO CALLED WIMAX), WHICH IS A WIRELESS BROADBAND ACCESS

TECHNOLOGY THAT LINKS WLAN/WIFI HOTSPOTS, PROVIDES BROADBAND WIRELESS CONNECTIVITY TO BUSINESSES AND HOMES, AND IS EXPECTED TO ENABLE BROADBAND WIRELESS ACCESS AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO EXISTING LAST MILE METHODS SUCH AS CABLE AND DIGITAL

SUBSCRIBER LINES (DSL). WE ALSO HAVE DEVELOPMENT INITIATIVES FOCUSING ON 802.11N, A NEXT-GENERATION WLAN TECHNOLOGY THAT IS EXPECTED TO ENABLE APPROXIMATELY THREE TIMES THE PERFORMANCE OF CURRENT 802.11 SOLUTIONS. FINALLY, OUR EFFORTS IN NETWORK AND

COMMUNICATIONS INITIATIVES HAVE LED TO HIGHER PERFORMANCE NETWORK PROCESSORS BASED ON THE INTEL XSCALE TECHNOLOGY, MODULAR COMMUNICATIONS BUILDING BLOCKS THAT REDUCE DEVELOPMENT COSTS AND TIME FOR NETWORK SYSTEMS DEVELOPERS, AND STANDARDIZED OPTICAL

COMPONENTS AND MODULES FOR REDUCED POWER CONSUMPTION AND COST.

IN ADDITION, WE ARE WORKING TO BRING ADVANCED SILICON TECHNOLOGIES TO CONSUMER ELECTRONICS. WE ARE CURRENTLY DEVELOPING A NEW TECHNOLOGY BASED ON A TECHNIQUE CALLED LIQUID CRYSTAL ON SILICON (LCOS). LCOS IS USED TO CREATE SMALL CHIPS CALLED

MICRO-DISPLAYS THAT PRODUCE IMAGES THAT ARE DISPLAYED ON LARGE-SCREEN, REAR-PROJECTION TELEVISIONS.

OUR R&D ON BOTH PROCESSES AND PRODUCTS MAY INVOLVE CURRENT-GENERATION ACTIVITIES AS WELL AS DEVELOPMENT OF PROCESS AND PRODUCT ROADMAPS EXTENDING INTO

THE FUTURE FOR SUCCESSIVE GENERATIONS. OUR MANUFACTURING PROCESS WORK, PARTICULARLY FOR FUTURE PROCESS TECHNOLOGY GENERATIONS, TYPICALLY INVOLVES SUBSTANTIAL EXPERIMENTATION, INVENTION AND EVALUATION RELATING TO NUMEROUS ASPECTS OF MANUFACTURING

CAPABILITY. TO VARYING DEGREES, THESE EFFORTS RELY ON THE WORK OF THIRD PARTIES SUCH AS UNIVERSITY RESEARCHERS AND MANUFACTURERS OF SEMICONDUCTOR FACTORY EQUIPMENT. OUR PROCESS DEVELOPMENT WORK MAY INVOLVE ALTERNATIVE AND COMPETING TECHNOLOGIES,

AND, FOR TECHNOLOGICAL OR OTHER BUSINESS REASONS, NOT ALL OF OUR EFFORTS WILL RESULT IN TECHNOLOGY THAT WE DEPLOY IN OUR MANUFACTURING OPERATIONS.

FROM TIME TO TIME, WE MAY TERMINATE PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT BEFORE COMPLETION OR DECIDE NOT TO MANUFACTURE AND SELL A DEVELOPED PRODUCT. WE DO NOT EXPECT THAT

ALL OF OUR PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS WILL RESULT IN PRODUCTS THAT ARE ULTIMATELY RELEASED FOR SALE. FOR A

VARIETY OF REASONS, WE MAY DECIDE NOT TO MOVE FORWARD WITH A PARTICULAR PRODUCT. FOR EXAMPLE, WE MAY DECIDE THAT THE PRODUCT MIGHT NOT BE SUFFICIENTLY

COMPETITIVE IN THE RELEVANT MARKET SEGMENT, OR FOR TECHNOLOGICAL OR MARKETING REASONS, WE MAY DECIDE TO OFFER A DIFFERENT PRODUCT INSTEAD. OUR PRODUCTS OFTEN INCORPORATE FEATURES THAT WILL ONLY INCREASE THE PRODUCTS PERFORMANCE OR BE OTHERWISE

USEFUL TO THE END USER IF OTHER COMPANIES HAVE DEVELOPED OPERATING SYSTEMS, OTHER SOFTWARE APPLICATIONS OR OTHER HARDWARE THAT TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THESE FEATURES. WE CONTINUE TO WORK WITH OTHER HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE COMPANIES AND INDUSTRY GROUPS TO

ENCOURAGE THE DEVELOPMENT OF PRODUCT OFFERINGS DESIGNED TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF OUR PRODUCTS FEATURES.

WE CONTINUE OUR COMMITMENT TO INVEST IN LEADING-EDGE TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT. OUR EXPENDITURES FOR R&D WERE $4,360 MILLION IN FISCAL 2003, $4,034

MILLION IN FISCAL 2002 AND $3,796 MILLION IN FISCAL 2001. ADDITIONALLY, WE INCURRED CHARGES FOR PURCHASED IN-PROCESS R&D RELATED TO ACQUISITIONS OF $5 MILLION FOR FISCAL 2003, $20 MILLION FOR FISCAL 2002 AND $198 MILLION FOR FISCAL 2001. WHILE

WE HELD THE TOTAL NUMBER OF EMPLOYEES FLAT, WE INCREASED THE NUMBER OF OUR EMPLOYEES ENGAGED IN R&D TO APPROXIMATELY 23,000 AT DECEMBER 2003 COMPARED TO APPROXIMATELY 21,000 AT DECEMBER 2002.

ACQUISITIONS AND STRATEGIC INVESTMENTS

THE LEVEL OF NEW ACQUISITION AND STRATEGIC INVESTMENT ACTIVITY FOR 2003 AND

2002 WAS SUBSTANTIALLY LOWER THAN IN PRIOR YEARS. DURING 2003, WE COMPLETED ONE ACQUISITION FOR TOTAL CONSIDERATION OF $21 MILLION. WE ALSO ACQUIRED ONE DEVELOPMENT-STAGE OPERATION IN EXCHANGE FOR TOTAL CONSIDERATION OF APPROXIMATELY $40 MILLION.

UNDER OUR INTEL CAPITAL PROGRAM, WE MAKE EQUITY INVESTMENTS IN

COMPANIES AROUND THE WORLD TO FURTHER OUR STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES AND SUPPORT OUR KEY BUSINESS INITIATIVES. THE INTEL CAPITAL PROGRAM FOCUSES ON INVESTING IN COMPANIES AND INITIATIVES TO STIMULATE GROWTH IN THE INTERNET ECONOMY AND ITS INFRASTRUCTURE,

CREATE NEW BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES FOR INTEL, AND EXPAND GLOBAL MARKETS FOR OUR PRODUCTS. THE INVESTMENTS MAY SUPPORT, AMONG OTHER THINGS, INTEL PRODUCT INITIATIVES, EMERGING TRENDS IN THE TECHNOLOGY INDUSTRY OR WORLDWIDE INTERNET DEPLOYMENT. THIS

STRATEGIC INVESTMENT PROGRAM HELPS ADVANCE OUR OVERALL MISSION TO BE THE PREEMINENT SUPPLIER OF BUILDING BLOCKS TO THE WORLDWIDE INTERNET ECONOMY. MANY OF OUR INVESTMENTS ARE IN PRIVATE COMPANIES, INCLUDING DEVELOPMENT-STAGE COMPANIES WITH LITTLE OR

NO REVENUE FROM CURRENT PRODUCT OFFERINGS.

WE INVEST IN

COMPANIES THAT DEVELOP SOFTWARE, HARDWARE AND OTHER TECHNOLOGIES OR PROVIDE SERVICES SUPPORTING OUR TECHNOLOGIES. OUR CURRENT INVESTMENT FOCUS AREAS INCLUDE: ENABLING MOBILE AND INTERNET CLIENT DEVICES, HELPING TO CREATE THE DIGITAL HOME, ADVANCING

HIGH-PERFORMANCE COMMUNICATIONS INFRASTRUCTURES AND DEVELOPING THE NEXT GENERATION OF SILICON PRODUCTION TECHNOLOGIES. OUR FOCUS AREAS TEND TO DEVELOP AND CHANGE OVER TIME DUE TO RAPID ADVANCEMENTS IN TECHNOLOGY.

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND LICENSING

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS THAT APPLY TO OUR VARIOUS PRODUCTS AND SERVICES

INCLUDE PATENTS, COPYRIGHTS, TRADE SECRETS, TRADEMARKS AND MASKWORK RIGHTS. WE MAINTAIN AN ACTIVE PROGRAM TO PROTECT OUR INVESTMENT IN TECHNOLOGY BY ENFORCING OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS. THE EXTENT OF THE LEGAL PROTECTION GIVEN TO DIFFERENT

TYPES OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS VARIES UNDER DIFFERENT COUNTRIES LEGAL SYSTEMS. WE INTEND TO LICENSE OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS BROADLY WHERE WE CAN OBTAIN ADEQUATE CONSIDERATION. SEE COMPETITION IN PART I, ITEM 1 OF

THIS FORM 10-K.

WE HAVE FILED AND OBTAINED A NUMBER OF PATENTS

IN THE U.S. AND ABROAD. WHILE OUR PATENTS ARE AN IMPORTANT ELEMENT OF OUR SUCCESS, OUR BUSINESS AS A WHOLE IS NOT MATERIALLY DEPENDENT ON ANY ONE PATENT. WE AND OTHER COMPANIES IN THE COMPUTING, TELECOMMUNICATIONS AND RELATED HIGH-TECHNOLOGY FIELDS

TYPICALLY APPLY FOR AND RECEIVE, IN THE AGGREGATE, THOUSANDS OF PATENTS ANNUALLY IN THE U.S. AND OTHER COUNTRIES. WE BELIEVE THAT THE DURATION OF THE APPLICABLE PATENTS WE ARE GRANTED IS ADEQUATE RELATIVE TO THE EXPECTED LIVES OF OUR PRODUCTS.

BECAUSE OF THE FAST PACE OF INNOVATION AND PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT, OUR PRODUCTS ARE OFTEN OBSOLETE BEFORE THE PATENTS RELATED TO THEM EXPIRE, AND SOMETIMES ARE OBSOLETE BEFORE THE PATENTS RELATED TO THEM ARE EVEN GRANTED. AS WE EXPAND OUR PRODUCT

OFFERINGS INTO NEW INDUSTRIES, SUCH AS CONSUMER ELECTRONICS, WE EXTEND OUR PATENT DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS TO PATENT SUCH PRODUCT OFFERINGS. ESTABLISHED COMPETITORS IN THESE INDUSTRIES MAY ALREADY HAVE PATENTS COVERING SIMILAR PRODUCTS, AND WHILE OUR

PATENTS IN ADJACENT TECHNOLOGY AREAS MAY SERVE TO DETER SOME CLAIMS OF INFRINGEMENT, THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO OBTAIN PATENTS COVERING OUR OWN PRODUCTS, OR THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO OBTAIN CROSS LICENSES FROM SUCH COMPETITORS ON

FAVORABLE TERMS OR AT ALL.

THE SOFTWARE EMBEDDED IN OUR

COMPONENT AND SYSTEM-LEVEL PRODUCTS IS ENTITLED TO COPYRIGHT PROTECTION. UNDER SOME CIRCUMSTANCES, WE MAY REQUIRE OUR CUSTOMERS TO OBTAIN A SOFTWARE LICENSE BEFORE WE PROVIDE THEM WITH THAT SOFTWARE.

TO DISTINGUISH GENUINE INTEL PRODUCTS FROM OUR COMPETITORS PRODUCTS, WE

HAVE OBTAINED CERTAIN TRADEMARKS AND TRADE NAMES FOR OUR PRODUCTS, AND WE MAINTAIN COOPERATIVE ADVERTISING PROGRAMS WITH OEMS TO PROMOTE OUR BRANDS AND IDENTIFY PRODUCTS CONTAINING GENUINE INTEL COMPONENTS.

OUR ABILITY TO ENFORCE OUR PATENTS, COPYRIGHTS, SOFTWARE LICENSES AND OTHER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY IS SUBJECT TO GENERAL

LITIGATION RISKS, AS WELL AS UNCERTAINTY AS TO THE ENFORCEABILITY OF VARIOUS INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS IN VARIOUS COUNTRIES. WHEN WE SEEK TO ENFORCE OUR RIGHTS, WE ARE OFTEN SUBJECT TO CLAIMS THAT THE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHT IS INVALID, IS

OTHERWISE NOT ENFORCEABLE OR IS LICENSED TO THE PARTY AGAINST WHOM WE ARE ASSERTING A CLAIM. IN ADDITION, OUR ASSERTION OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS OFTEN RESULTS IN THE OTHER PARTY SEEKING TO ASSERT ALLEGED INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS OF ITS

OWN AGAINST US. LIKE MANY COMPANIES IN THE SEMICONDUCTOR AND OTHER HIGH-TECHNOLOGY INDUSTRIES, WE RECEIVE CLAIMS THAT WE MAY BE INFRINGING OTHERS INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS. IN ADDITION, OUR SALES AGREEMENTS OFTEN CONTAIN INTELLECTUAL

PROPERTY INDEMNITIES, SUCH AS PATENT AND COPYRIGHT INDEMNITIES, AND OUR CUSTOMERS MAY ASSERT CLAIMS AGAINST US FOR INDEMNITY WHEN THEY RECEIVE CLAIMS ALLEGING THAT OUR CUSTOMERS PRODUCTS INFRINGE OTHERS INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS. WHEN

WE RECEIVE SUCH CLAIMS, WE REFER THEM TO OUR COUNSEL, AND CURRENT CLAIMS ARE IN VARIOUS STAGES OF EVALUATION AND NEGOTIATION. IF WE DETERMINE THAT IT IS NECESSARY OR DESIRABLE, WE MAY SEEK LICENSES FOR CERTAIN INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS. HOWEVER,

WE CAN GIVE NO ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO OBTAIN LICENSES FROM ANY CLAIMANT, OR THAT WE CAN ACCEPT THE TERMS OF ANY OFFERED LICENSES. FURTHER, WE ARE NOT ABLE TO RESOLVE EVERY DISPUTE WITHOUT LITIGATION, WHICH IS TYPICALLY TIME-CONSUMING AND

EXPENSIVE. IF WE ARE NOT ULTIMATELY SUCCESSFUL IN DEFENDING OURSELVES AGAINST THESE CLAIMS IN LITIGATION, WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO SELL A PARTICULAR PRODUCT OR FAMILY OF PRODUCTS DUE TO AN INJUNCTION, OR WE MAY HAVE TO PAY MATERIAL AMOUNTS OF DAMAGES.

COMPLIANCE WITH ENVIRONMENTAL, HEALTH AND SAFETY REGULATIONS

INTEL IS COMMITTED TO ACHIEVING HIGH STANDARDS OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY AND PRODUCT SAFETY, AND STRIVES TO PROVIDE A SAFE AND HEALTHY WORKPLACE FOR OUR

EMPLOYEES, CONTRACTORS AND THE COMMUNITIES IN WHICH WE DO BUSINESS. WE HAVE ENVIRONMENTAL, HEALTH AND SAFETY (EHS) POLICIES AND EXPECTATIONS THAT ARE APPLIED TO OUR GLOBAL OPERATIONS. EACH OF INTELS WORLDWIDE MANUFACTURING AND ASSEMBLY/TEST

SITES IS CERTIFIED TO THE INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATION FOR STANDARDIZATION (ISO) 14001 ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT SYSTEM STANDARD, WHICH REQUIRES THAT A BROAD RANGE OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROCESSES AND POLICIES BE IN PLACE TO MINIMIZE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT AND

MAINTAIN COMPLIANCE WITH ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS. INTELS INTERNAL ENVIRONMENTAL AUDITING PROGRAM INCLUDES NOT ONLY COMPLIANCE COMPONENTS, BUT ALSO MODULES ON BUSINESS RISK, ENVIRONMENTAL EXCELLENCE AND MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS. WE HAVE INTERNAL

PROCESSES THAT FOCUS ON MINIMIZING AND PROPERLY MANAGING ANY HAZARDOUS MATERIALS USED IN OUR FACILITIES AND PRODUCTS. WE MONITOR REGULATORY TRENDS AND SET COMPANY-WIDE SHORT- AND LONG-TERM PERFORMANCE TARGETS FOR KEY RESOURCES AND EMISSIONS. THESE

TARGETS ADDRESS SEVERAL PARAMETERS, INCLUDING ENERGY AND WATER USE, CLIMATE CHANGE, WASTE RECYCLING AND EMISSIONS. INTEL REMAINS ON TRACK TO ACHIEVE OUR VOLUNTARY COMMITMENT TO, BY 2010, REDUCE EMISSIONS OF CERTAIN GLOBAL WARMING GASES BY 10% FROM

1995 LEVELS. DUE TO INTELS INCREASE IN MANUFACTURING SINCE 1995, THIS EQUATES TO AN ACTUAL REDUCTION IN 2004 OF MORE THAN 90% FROM WHAT INTEL WOULD HAVE EMITTED WITHOUT THE VOLUNTARY REDUCTION. THE COMPANY ALSO HAS SEVERAL KEY TECHNOLOGIES

DESIGNED TO REDUCE ENERGY USE IN OUR PRODUCTS AND PRODUCTS USING OUR COMPONENTS AND RECENTLY ADDED AN ENERGY REDUCTION GOAL TO ITS LIST OF EHS PERFORMANCE INDICATORS. FOR EXAMPLE, ALL INTEL DESKTOP PROCESSORS PRODUCED IN 2003 ARE CAPABLE OF TAKING

ADVANTAGE OF THE ADVANCED ENERGY SAVINGS FEATURES OF THE INSTANTLY AVAILABLE PC PLATFORM, WHICH MAKES IT POSSIBLE TO HAVE A HIGH-PERFORMANCE, FEATURE-RICH PC THAT IS POWER EFFICIENT WHEN BOTH ACTIVE AND IDLE, AND REMAINS CONNECTED TO A NETWORK EVEN

WHEN POWERED OFF.

THE MANUFACTURE, ASSEMBLY AND TESTING OF

INTEL PRODUCTS REQUIRES THE USE OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS THAT ARE SUBJECT TO A BROAD ARRAY OF EHS LAWS AND REGULATIONS. AS INTEL CONTINUES TO ADVANCE PROCESS TECHNOLOGY, THE MATERIALS, TECHNOLOGIES AND PRODUCTS THEMSELVES BECOME INCREASINGLY COMPLEX.

OUR EVALUATIONS OF NEW MATERIALS FOR USE IN R&D, MANUFACTURING, AND ASSEMBLY AND TEST TAKE INTO ACCOUNT EHS CONSIDERATIONS AND ARE A COMPONENT OF INTELS DESIGN FOR EHS PROCESSES. MANY NEW MATERIALS BEING EVALUATED FOR USE MAY BE SUBJECT TO

REGULATION UNDER EXISTING OR FUTURE LAWS AND REGULATIONS. FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH ANY OF THE APPLICABLE LAWS OR REGULATIONS COULD RESULT IN FINES, SUSPENSION OF PRODUCTION, ALTERATION OF FABRICATION AND ASSEMBLY PROCESSES, CURTAILMENT OF OPERATIONS

OR SALES, AND LEGAL LIABILITY. INTELS FAILURE TO PROPERLY MANAGE THE USE, TRANSPORTATION, EMISSION, DISCHARGE, STORAGE, RECYCLING OR DISPOSAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS COULD SUBJECT THE COMPANY TO FUTURE LIABILITIES. EXISTING OR FUTURE LAWS AND

REGULATIONS COULD REQUIRE INTEL TO PROCURE POLLUTION ABATEMENT OR REMEDIATION EQUIPMENT, MODIFY PRODUCT DESIGNS, OR INCUR OTHER EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH THE LAWS AND REGULATIONS. IN ADDITION, RESTRICTIONS ON THE USE OF CERTAIN MATERIALS IN OUR

FACILITIES OR PRODUCTS IN THE FUTURE COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR OPERATIONS. COMPLIANCE WITH THESE COMPLEX LAWS AND REGULATIONS, AS WELL AS INTERNAL VOLUNTARY PROGRAMS, IS INTEGRATED INTO OUR MANUFACTURING AND ASSEMBLY AND TEST

PROCESSES. TO OUR KNOWLEDGE, COMPLIANCE WITH THESE LAWS AND REGULATIONS HAS HAD NO MATERIAL EFFECT UPON OUR OPERATIONS. WE ALSO REFER TO THE INFORMATION UNDER THE HEADING LEGAL PROCEEDINGS IN PART I, ITEM 3 OF THIS FORM 10-K.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE IS TYPICALLY DEFINED AS THE SYSTEM THAT ALLOCATES DUTIES AND AUTHORITY AMONG A COMPANYS STOCKHOLDERS, BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND

MANAGEMENT. THE STOCKHOLDERS ELECT THE BOARD AND VOTE ON EXTRAORDINARY MATTERS; THE BOARD IS THE COMPANYS GOVERNING BODY, RESPONSIBLE FOR HIRING, OVERSEEING AND EVALUATING MANAGEMENT, PARTICULARLY THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER (CEO); AND

MANAGEMENT RUNS THE COMPANYS DAY-TO-DAY OPERATIONS. THE BOARD BELIEVES THAT THERE SHOULD BE A SUBSTANTIAL MAJORITY OF INDEPENDENT DIRECTORS ON THE BOARD. THE BOARD ALSO BELIEVES THAT IT IS USEFUL AND APPROPRIATE TO HAVE MEMBERS OF MANAGEMENT,

INCLUDING THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, AS DIRECTORS.

THE

BOARDS GENERAL POLICY, BASED ON EXPERIENCE, IS THAT THE POSITIONS OF CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER SHOULD BE HELD BY SEPARATE PERSONS AS AN AID IN THE BOARDS OVERSIGHT OF MANAGEMENT. IN ADDITION, THE BOARD HAS AN

INDEPENDENT DIRECTOR DESIGNATED AS THE LEAD INDEPENDENT DIRECTOR, WHO IS RESPONSIBLE FOR COORDINATING THE ACTIVITIES OF THE OTHER INDEPENDENT DIRECTORS AND PERFORMS VARIOUS OTHER DUTIES. THE GENERAL AUTHORITY AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE LEAD

INDEPENDENT DIRECTOR ARE ESTABLISHED IN A WRITTEN CHARTER ADOPTED BY THE BOARD.

THE CURRENT BOARD MEMBERS INCLUDE TEN INDEPENDENT DIRECTORS AND THREE MEMBERS OF INTELS SENIOR MANAGEMENT. THE BOARD MEMBERS INCLUDE CRAIG R. BARRETT, INTELS CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER; AMBASSADOR CHARLENE

INDEPENDENT DIRECTORS.

EACH OF THE

COMPANYS DIRECTORS OTHER THAN MESSRS. GROVE, BARRETT AND OTELLINI QUALIFY AS INDEPENDENT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE PUBLISHED LISTING REQUIREMENTS OF THE NASDAQ STOCK MARKET (NASDAQ)*. THE NASDAQ INDEPENDENCE DEFINITION INCLUDES A

SERIES OF OBJECTIVE TESTS, SUCH AS THAT THE DIRECTOR IS NOT AN EMPLOYEE OF THE COMPANY AND HAS NOT ENGAGED IN VARIOUS TYPES OF BUSINESS DEALINGS WITH THE COMPANY. IN ADDITION, AS FURTHER REQUIRED BY THE NASDAQ RULES, THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS HAS MADE

A SUBJECTIVE DETERMINATION AS TO EACH INDEPENDENT DIRECTOR THAT NO RELATIONSHIPS EXIST WHICH, IN THE OPINION OF THE BOARD, WOULD INTERFERE WITH THE EXERCISE OF INDEPENDENT JUDGMENT IN CARRYING OUT THE RESPONSIBILITIES OF A DIRECTOR. IN MAKING THESE

DETERMINATIONS, THE DIRECTORS REVIEWED AND DISCUSSED INFORMATION PROVIDED BY THE DIRECTORS AND THE COMPANY WITH REGARD TO EACH DIRECTORS BUSINESS AND PERSONAL ACTIVITIES AS THEY MAY RELATE TO INTEL AND INTELS MANAGEMENT.

IN ADDITION, THE MEMBERS OF THE AUDIT COMMITTEE OF THE BOARD ALSO EACH

QUALIFY AS INDEPENDENT UNDER SPECIAL STANDARDS ESTABLISHED BY THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (SEC) FOR MEMBERS OF AUDIT COMMITTEES, AND THE AUDIT COMMITTEE INCLUDES AT LEAST ONE MEMBER WHO IS DETERMINED BY THE BOARD TO MEET THE

QUALIFICATIONS OF AN AUDIT COMMITTEE FINANCIAL EXPERT IN ACCORDANCE WITH SEC RULES, INCLUDING THAT THE PERSON MEETS THE RELEVANT DEFINITION OF AN INDEPENDENT DIRECTOR. E. JOHN P. BROWNE IS THE INDEPENDENT DIRECTOR WHO HAS

BEEN DETERMINED TO BE AN AUDIT COMMITTEE FINANCIAL EXPERT. STOCKHOLDERS SHOULD UNDERSTAND THAT THIS DESIGNATION IS A DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENT OF THE SEC RELATED TO MR. BROWNES EXPERIENCE AND UNDERSTANDING WITH RESPECT TO CERTAIN ACCOUNTING AND

AUDITING MATTERS. THE DESIGNATION DOES NOT IMPOSE ON MR. BROWNE ANY DUTIES, OBLIGATIONS OR LIABILITY THAT ARE GREATER THAN ARE GENERALLY IMPOSED ON HIM AS A MEMBER OF THE AUDIT COMMITTEE AND BOARD OF DIRECTORS, AND HIS DESIGNATION AS AN AUDIT

COMMITTEE FINANCIAL EXPERT PURSUANT TO THIS SEC REQUIREMENT DOES NOT AFFECT THE DUTIES, OBLIGATIONS OR LIABILITY OF ANY OTHER MEMBER OF THE AUDIT COMMITTEE OR BOARD OF DIRECTORS.

RESULT, THE PRIORITIES AND EMPHASIS OF THE COMMITTEE AND OF THE BOARD MAY CHANGE FROM TIME TO TIME TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT CHANGES IN BUSINESS AND OTHER TRENDS, AND THE PORTFOLIO OF SKILLS AND EXPERIENCE OF CURRENT AND PROSPECTIVE BOARD MEMBERS. THE

STOCKHOLDERS MEETING.

POLICY THAT SEEKS TO LIMIT THE NUMBER OF BOARD SEATS HELD BY AN INDEPENDENT DIRECTOR, BUT THE BOARDS GUIDELINE OF 100% ATTENDANCE AT MEETINGS REFLECTS THE BOARDS EXPECTATION THAT EACH DIRECTOR WILL MEET HIS OR HER COMMITMENTS TO THE

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

A.  TAX MATTERS

IN AUGUST 2003, IN CONNECTION WITH THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE (IRS) REGULAR EXAMINATION OF INTELS TAX RETURNS FOR THE YEARS 1999 AND 2000, THE IRS PROPOSED CERTAIN ADJUSTMENTS TO THE AMOUNTS REFLECTED BY INTEL ON THESE RETURNS AS A

TAX BENEFIT FOR ITS EXPORT SALES. IF THE IRS ISSUES FORMAL ASSESSMENTS CONSISTENT WITH THE NOTICES AND ULTIMATELY PREVAILS IN ITS POSITION, INTELS FEDERAL INCOME TAX LIABILITY FOR THESE YEARS WOULD INCREASE BY APPROXIMATELY $600 MILLION, PLUS

INTEREST. THE IRS MAY MAKE SIMILAR CLAIMS FOR YEARS SUBSEQUENT TO 2000 IN FUTURE AUDITS.

INTEL DISPUTES THE PROPOSED ADJUSTMENTS AND INTENDS TO PURSUE THIS MATTER THROUGH APPLICABLE IRS AND JUDICIAL PROCEDURES, AS APPROPRIATE. ALTHOUGH THE

FINAL RESOLUTION OF THE PROPOSED ADJUSTMENTS IS UNCERTAIN, BASED ON CURRENTLY AVAILABLE INFORMATION, MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT THE ULTIMATE OUTCOME WILL NOT HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL POSITION, CASH FLOWS OR

OVERALL TRENDS IN RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. IN THE EVENT OF AN UNFAVORABLE RESOLUTION, THERE EXISTS THE POSSIBILITY OF A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON THE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OF THE PERIOD IN WHICH THE MATTER IS ULTIMATELY RESOLVED, OR AN UNFAVORABLE

OUTCOME BECOMES PROBABLE AND REASONABLY ESTIMABLE.

B.  LITIGATION

INTEL

CURRENTLY IS A PARTY TO VARIOUS LEGAL PROCEEDINGS, INCLUDING THOSE NOTED BELOW. WHILE MANAGEMENT PRESENTLY BELIEVES THAT THE ULTIMATE OUTCOME OF THESE PROCEEDINGS, INDIVIDUALLY AND IN THE AGGREGATE, WILL NOT HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR

FINANCIAL POSITION OR OVERALL TRENDS IN RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, LITIGATION IS SUBJECT TO INHERENT UNCERTAINTIES, AND UNFAVORABLE RULINGS COULD OCCUR. AN UNFAVORABLE RULING COULD INCLUDE MONEY DAMAGES OR, IN CASES FOR WHICH INJUNCTIVE RELIEF IS

SOUGHT, AN INJUNCTION PROHIBITING INTEL FROM SELLING ONE OR MORE PRODUCTS. WERE AN UNFAVORABLE RULING TO OCCUR, THERE EXISTS THE POSSIBILITY OF A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON THE NET INCOME OF THE PERIOD IN WHICH THE RULING OCCURS OR FUTURE PERIODS.

INTERGRAPH CORPORATION V. INTEL

U.S. DISTRICT COURT, NORTHERN DISTRICT OF ALABAMA, NORTHEASTERN DIVISION

U.S. DISTRICT COURT, EASTERN DISTRICT OF TEXAS

IN 1997, INTERGRAPH CORPORATION FILED SUIT IN FEDERAL DISTRICT COURT IN ALABAMA, GENERALLY ALLEGING, AMONG OTHER CLAIMS, THAT INTEL INFRINGED CERTAIN

INTERGRAPH PATENTS. IN AUGUST 2001, INTERGRAPH FILED A SECOND SUIT IN THE U.S. DISTRICT COURT FOR THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF TEXAS, ALLEGING THAT THE INTEL

ITANIUM

®

PROCESSOR INFRINGES TWO INTERGRAPH MICROPROCESSOR-RELATED PATENTS, AND SEEKING AN INJUNCTION AND UNSPECIFIED DAMAGES. IN APRIL 2002, INTEL AND

INTERGRAPH ANNOUNCED THAT THEY ENTERED INTO A SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT, PURSUANT TO WHICH THEY AGREED TO SETTLE THE ALABAMA LAWSUIT AND DISMISS IT WITH PREJUDICE.

UNDER THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT, THE TEXAS CASE WOULD PROCEED TO TRIAL. IF THE PATENTS IN THE TEXAS CASE WERE FOUND TO BE INFRINGED, NOT INVALID AND

ENFORCEABLE, INTEL WOULD PAY INTERGRAPH $150 MILLION WITHIN 30 DAYS OF THE ENTRY OF A FINAL JUDGMENT. IF INTERGRAPH PREVAILED ON EITHER PATENT ON APPEAL, THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT PROVIDES THAT INTEL WOULD PAY INTERGRAPH AN ADDITIONAL $100 MILLION

AND WOULD RECEIVE A LICENSE FOR THE PATENTS AT ISSUE IN THE CASE.

IN OCTOBER 2002, THE TEXAS DISTRICT COURT RULED THAT INTEL INFRINGED BOTH PATENTS AT ISSUE IN THAT CASE. PURSUANT TO THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT, INTEL PAID INTERGRAPH $150 MILLION. INTEL THEN APPEALED THE TRIAL COURTS DECISION. IN

FEBRUARY 2004, THE COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE FEDERAL CIRCUIT FOUND THAT THE DISTRICT COURT ERRED IN CONSTRUING A CLAIM TERM, REVISED THE CLAIM CONSTRUCTION, VACATED THE DISTRICT COURT RULING AND REMANDED THE CASE TO THE DISTRICT COURT TO DETERMINE IN

THE FIRST INSTANCE WHETHER THE INTEL ITANIUM PROCESSOR INFRINGES THE PATENTS. INTEL IS CURRENTLY EVALUATING THE IMPACT THAT THE COURT OF APPEALS OPINION HAS ON THE 2002 SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT.

INTERGRAPH CORPORATION V. DELL INC., ET AL.

U.S. DISTRICT COURT, EASTERN DISTRICT OF TEXAS

IN DECEMBER 2002, INTERGRAPH FILED SUIT IN THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF TEXAS AGAINST DELL INC., GATEWAY INC. AND HEWLETT-PACKARD COMPANY, ALLEGING

INFRINGEMENT OF THREE OF INTERGRAPHS PATENTS. THESE THREE PATENTS ARE A SUBSET OF THE PATENTS THAT WERE THE SUBJECT OF A NOW SETTLED LAWSUIT THAT INTERGRAPH HAD FILED AGAINST INTEL IN ALABAMA. IN MAY 2003, DELL FILED ITS ANSWER AND

COUNTERCLAIM AND NAMED INTEL AS WELL AS INTERGRAPH IN A COUNTERCLAIM FOR DECLARATORY JUDGMENT. NONE OF THE OTHER DEFENDANTS HAVE NAMED INTEL AS A COUNTER-DEFENDANT. THE CLAIM AGAINST INTEL DOES NOT SEEK ANY MONETARY OR OTHER SPECIFIC RELIEF. RATHER,

DELL SEEKS A JUDICIAL INTERPRETATION OF THE APRIL 2002 SETTLEMENT AND LICENSE AGREEMENT BETWEEN INTEL AND INTERGRAPH INSOFAR AS THAT AGREEMENT RELATES TO ANY

IN 2001, VARIOUS PLAINTIFFS FILED FIVE CLASS-ACTION LAWSUITS AGAINST INTEL ALLEGING VIOLATIONS OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE

ACT OF 1934. THESE COMPLAINTS WERE CONSOLIDATED IN AN AMENDED COMPLAINT FILED IN THE U.S. DISTRICT COURT FOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA. THE LAWSUIT ALLEGED THAT PURCHASERS OF INTEL STOCK BETWEEN JULY 19, 2000 AND SEPTEMBER 29, 2000 WERE

MISLED BY FALSE AND MISLEADING STATEMENTS BY INTEL AND CERTAIN OF ITS OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS CONCERNING THE COMPANYS BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. IN JULY 2003, THE COURT GRANTED INTELS MOTION TO DISMISS THE PLAINTIFFS SECOND

AMENDED COMPLAINT IN ITS ENTIRETY WITH PREJUDICE, AND THE PLAINTIFFS DID NOT APPEAL THE COURTS DISMISSAL OF THE SUIT.

IN ADDITION, VARIOUS PLAINTIFFS FILED STOCKHOLDER DERIVATIVE COMPLAINTS IN CALIFORNIA SUPERIOR COURT AND DELAWARE CHANCERY COURT AGAINST THE

COMPANYS DIRECTORS AND CERTAIN OFFICERS, ALLEGING THAT THEY MISMANAGED THE COMPANY AND OTHERWISE BREACHED THEIR FIDUCIARY OBLIGATIONS TO THE COMPANY. THE PLAINTIFFS IN THE CALIFORNIA ACTION FILED THE ORIGINAL AND TWO SUCCESSIVE AMENDED

COMPLAINTS, AND THE CALIFORNIA SUPERIOR COURT SUSTAINED INTELS DEMURRERS ON EACH OF THESE COMPLAINTS. FOLLOWING THE COURTS DISMISSAL WITHOUT PREJUDICE OF THESE COMPLAINTS, THE PLAINTIFFS NOTIFIED THE COURT AND INTEL IN JUNE 2003 THAT

THEY WOULD NOT FILE A FOURTH COMPLAINT, AND THEY SIGNED A STIPULATION WITHDRAWING THEIR LAWSUIT WITH PREJUDICE, WHICH THE COURT APPROVED. IN DECEMBER 2003, THE PLAINTIFFS IN THE DELAWARE ACTION WITHDREW THEIR COMPLAINT AND THE CASE WAS DISMISSED

WITH PREJUDICE.

C.  ENVIRONMENTAL PROCEEDINGS

INTEL HAS BEEN NAMED TO THE CALIFORNIA AND U.S. SUPERFUND LISTS FOR THREE OF OUR SITES AND HAS COMPLETED, ALONG WITH TWO OTHER COMPANIES, A REMEDIAL

INVESTIGATION/FEASIBILITY STUDY WITH THE U.S. ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY (EPA) TO EVALUATE THE GROUNDWATER IN AREAS ADJACENT TO ONE OF OUR FORMER SITES. THE EPA HAS ISSUED A RECORD OF DECISION WITH RESPECT TO A GROUNDWATER CLEANUP PLAN AT THAT

SITE, INCLUDING EXPECTED COSTS OF COMPLETION. UNDER THE CALIFORNIA AND U.S. SUPERFUND STATUTES, LIABILITY FOR CLEANUP OF THIS SITE AND THE ADJACENT AREA IS JOINT AND SEVERAL. THE COMPANY, HOWEVER, HAS REACHED AGREEMENT WITH THOSE SAME TWO COMPANIES

THAT SIGNIFICANTLY LIMITS THE COMPANYS LIABILITIES UNDER THE PROPOSED CLEANUP PLAN. ALSO, THE COMPANY HAS COMPLETED EXTENSIVE STUDIES AT OUR OTHER SITES AND IS ENGAGED IN CLEANUP AT SEVERAL OF THESE SITES. IN THE OPINION OF MANAGEMENT, THE

POTENTIAL LOSSES TO THE COMPANY IN EXCESS OF AMOUNTS ALREADY ACCRUED ARISING OUT OF THESE MATTERS WOULD NOT HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL POSITION OR OVERALL TRENDS IN RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, EVEN IF JOINT AND SEVERAL

LIABILITY WERE TO BE ASSESSED.

THE ESTIMATE OF THE POTENTIAL

IMPACT ON THE FINANCIAL POSITION OR OVERALL RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE ABOVE LEGAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL PROCEEDINGS COULD CHANGE IN THE FUTURE.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

WE BEGIN MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (MD&A) WITH

INTELS OVERALL STRATEGY AND THE STRATEGY FOR OUR MAJOR BUSINESS UNITS TO GIVE THE READER AN OVERVIEW OF THE GOALS OF OUR BUSINESS AND THE DIRECTION IN WHICH OUR BUSINESS AND PRODUCTS ARE MOVING. THIS IS FOLLOWED BY A DISCUSSION OF THE CRITICAL

ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES THAT WE BELIEVE ARE IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTANDING THE ASSUMPTIONS AND JUDGMENTS INCORPORATED IN OUR REPORTED FINANCIAL RESULTS. IN THE NEXT SECTION, BEGINNING ON PAGE 35, WE DISCUSS OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR 2003 COMPARED TO

2002, AND FOR 2002 COMPARED TO 2001, BEGINNING WITH AN OVERVIEW. WE THEN PROVIDE AN ANALYSIS OF CHANGES IN OUR BALANCE SHEET AND CASH FLOWS, AND DISCUSS OUR FINANCIAL COMMITMENTS IN THE SECTIONS ENTITLED FINANCIAL CONDITION,

CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND OFF-BALANCE-SHEET ARRANGEMENTS. ON PAGE 46, WE CONCLUDE THIS MD&A WITH OUR BUSINESS OUTLOOK SECTION, DISCUSSING OUR OUTLOOK FOR 2004.

THIS MD&A SHOULD BE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE OTHER SECTIONS OF THIS

ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K, INCLUDING ITEM 1: BUSINESS; ITEM 6: SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA; AND ITEM 8: FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA. THE VARIOUS SECTIONS OF THIS MD&A CONTAIN A NUMBER OF

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS, ALL OF WHICH ARE BASED ON OUR CURRENT EXPECTATIONS AND COULD BE AFFECTED BY THE UNCERTAINTIES AND RISK FACTORS DESCRIBED THROUGHOUT THIS FILING AND PARTICULARLY IN THE BUSINESS OUTLOOK SECTION. OUR ACTUAL

RESULTS MAY DIFFER MATERIALLY, AND THESE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS DO NOT REFLECT THE POTENTIAL IMPACT OF ANY DIVESTITURES, MERGERS, ACQUISITIONS OR OTHER BUSINESS COMBINATIONS THAT HAD NOT BEEN COMPLETED AS OF FEBRUARY 18, 2004.

STRATEGY

OUR GOAL IS TO BE THE PREEMINENT BUILDING BLOCK SUPPLIER TO THE WORLDWIDE INTERNET ECONOMY. AS PART OF OUR OVERALL STRATEGY

TO COMPETE IN EACH RELEVANT MARKET SEGMENT, WE USE OUR CORE COMPETENCIES AND FINANCIAL RESOURCES, AS WELL AS OUR GLOBAL PRESENCE AND BRAND RECOGNITION. OUR GLOBAL MARKETING STRATEGY IS DESIGNED TO ASSOCIATE OUR BRANDS WITH ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY AND

INNOVATION. IN ADDITION, UNDER OUR INTEL CAPITAL PROGRAM, WE MAKE EQUITY INVESTMENTS IN COMPANIES AROUND THE WORLD TO FURTHER OUR STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES AND SUPPORT OUR KEY BUSINESS INITIATIVES.

OUR PRIMARY FOCUS IS ON DEVELOPING ADVANCED INTEGRATED SILICON TECHNOLOGY

SOLUTIONS, WHICH WE BELIEVE WILL PROVIDE THE PERFORMANCE AND TECHNOLOGY FEATURES NECESSARY TO HELP ACCELERATE THE CONVERGENCE OF COMPUTING AND COMMUNICATIONS CAPABILITIES. CONVERGENCE REFERS TO HAVING COMPUTING AND COMMUNICATIONS CAPABILITIES IN AN

INTEGRATED PRODUCT SOLUTION. WE ALSO PROVIDE KEY COMPONENTS FOR NETWORKING AND COMMUNICATIONS INFRASTRUCTURES USED TO CONNECT TECHNOLOGY USERS. WE BELIEVE USERS OF COMPUTING AND COMMUNICATIONS DEVICES WANT NOT ONLY HIGHER PERFORMANCE BUT ALSO OTHER

CAPABILITIES SUCH AS MULTITHREADED OR MULTITASKING CAPABILITY, SEAMLESS NETWORKING CONNECTIVITY, IMPROVED SECURITY, RELIABILITY, EASE OF USE AND INTEROPERABILITY AMONG DEVICES. IT IS OUR GOAL TO INCORPORATE FEATURES ADDRESSING THESE CAPABILITIES IN

OUR VARIOUS PRODUCTS TO MEET USER DEMANDS.

EACH OF OUR

OPERATING SEGMENTS USES ITS CORE COMPETENCIES IN THE DESIGN AND MANUFACTURE OF INTEGRATED CIRCUITS, AS WELL AS KEY SILICON AND PLATFORM CAPABILITIES, TO PROVIDE BUILDING BLOCKS FOR TECHNOLOGY SOLUTIONS. THE INTEL ARCHITECTURE BUSINESS PROVIDES THE

ADVANCED TECHNOLOGIES TO SUPPORT THE DESKTOP, MOBILE AND ENTERPRISE COMPUTING PLATFORMS. DURING 2003, OUR INTEL COMMUNICATIONS GROUP (ICG) FOCUSED ON WIRED AND WIRELESS NETWORK CONNECTIVITY PRODUCTS, AND PROVIDED KEY COMPONENTS FOR NETWORKING AND

COMMUNICATIONS INFRASTRUCTURE DEVICES AND OTHER INDUSTRIAL AND COMMERCIAL PURPOSES. FINALLY, DURING 2003, OUR WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS AND COMPUTING GROUP (WCCG) FOCUSED ON COMPONENT-LEVEL PRODUCTS AND PLATFORM SOLUTIONS FOR THE WIRELESS HANDHELD

COMMUNICATIONS AND COMPUTING MARKET SEGMENTS.

AS WE MOVE TO

EACH SUCCEEDING GENERATION OF MANUFACTURING PROCESS TECHNOLOGY, WE USE LESS SPACE PER TRANSISTOR, WHICH ENABLES US TO FIT MORE TRANSISTORS ON AN EQUIVALENT SIZE CHIP, DECREASE THE SIZE OF THE CHIP OR OFFER AN INCREASED NUMBER OF INTEGRATED FEATURES.

THIS DECREASE IN SIZE CAN ALSO RESULT IN FASTER MICROPROCESSORS AND SEMICONDUCTOR PRODUCTS THAT CONSUME LESS POWER AND/OR PRODUCTS THAT COST LESS TO MANUFACTURE.

IN DECEMBER 2003, WE ANNOUNCED THAT WE WOULD BE CONSOLIDATING OUR COMMUNICATIONS-RELATED BUSINESSES INTO A SINGLE

ORGANIZATION, THE INTEL COMMUNICATIONS GROUP. WE BELIEVE THAT AS COMPUTING AND COMMUNICATIONS CONVERGE, THE CONSOLIDATION OF ICG AND WCCG WILL GIVE US THE OPPORTUNITY TO BETTER COORDINATE PRODUCT PLANNING AND CUSTOMER FOCUS BETWEEN OUR

COMMUNICATIONS INFRASTRUCTURE AND WIRELESS CLIENT EFFORTS GOING FORWARD. THIS REORGANIZATION WAS NOT EFFECTIVE UNTIL FISCAL 2004. BECAUSE THE REPORTING PERIOD FOR THIS FORM 10-K IS AS OF DECEMBER 27, 2003, THE COMMUNICATIONS-RELATED BUSINESSES

DISCUSSED BELOW AND THE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR OUR OPERATING SEGMENTS IN THIS MD&A ARE PRESENTED UNDER THE ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE THAT EXISTED AS OF DECEMBER 27, 2003.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

THE METHODS, ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS WE USE IN APPLYING OUR ACCOUNTING POLICIES HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE RESULTS WE REPORT IN OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, WHICH WE DISCUSS UNDER THE HEADING RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOLLOWING

THIS SECTION OF OUR MD&A. SOME OF OUR ACCOUNTING POLICIES REQUIRE US TO MAKE DIFFICULT AND SUBJECTIVE JUDGMENTS, OFTEN AS A RESULT OF THE NEED TO MAKE ESTIMATES OF MATTERS THAT ARE INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN. OUR MOST CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

INCLUDE THE ASSESSMENT OF RECOVERABILITY OF GOODWILL, WHICH IMPACTS GOODWILL IMPAIRMENTS; VALUATION OF NON-MARKETABLE EQUITY SECURITIES, WHICH IMPACTS NET GAINS (LOSSES) ON EQUITY SECURITIES WHEN WE RECORD IMPAIRMENTS; VALUATION OF INVENTORY, WHICH

IMPACTS GROSS MARGIN; ASSESSMENT OF RECOVERABILITY OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS, WHICH PRIMARILY IMPACTS GROSS MARGIN WHEN WE IMPAIR MANUFACTURING ASSETS OR ACCELERATE THEIR DEPRECIATION; AND RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT OF CURRENT AND DEFERRED INCOME TAX

ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, WHICH IMPACTS OUR TAX PROVISION. BELOW, WE DISCUSS THESE POLICIES FURTHER, AS WELL AS THE ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS INVOLVED. WE ALSO HAVE OTHER POLICIES THAT WE CONSIDER KEY ACCOUNTING POLICIES, SUCH AS OUR POLICIES FOR

REVENUE RECOGNITION, INCLUDING THE DEFERRAL OF REVENUE ON SALES TO DISTRIBUTORS; HOWEVER, THESE POLICIES DO NOT MEET THE DEFINITION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES, BECAUSE THEY DO NOT GENERALLY REQUIRE US TO MAKE ESTIMATES OR JUDGMENTS THAT ARE

DIFFICULT OR SUBJECTIVE.

GOODWILL.

GOODWILL

IS INITIALLY RECORDED WHEN THE PURCHASE PRICE PAID FOR AN ACQUISITION EXCEEDS THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF THE NET IDENTIFIED TANGIBLE AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS ACQUIRED. WE PERFORM AN ANNUAL REVIEW IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF EACH YEAR, OR MORE FREQUENTLY

IF INDICATORS OF POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT EXIST, TO DETERMINE IF THE RECORDED GOODWILL IS IMPAIRED. OUR IMPAIRMENT REVIEW PROCESS COMPARES THE FAIR VALUE OF THE REPORTING UNIT TO ITS CARRYING VALUE, INCLUDING THE GOODWILL RELATED TO THE REPORTING UNIT.

TO DETERMINE THE FAIR VALUE, OUR REVIEW PROCESS USES THE INCOME METHOD AND IS BASED ON A DISCOUNTED FUTURE CASH FLOW APPROACH THAT USES ESTIMATES INCLUDING THE FOLLOWING FOR THE REPORTING UNITS: REVENUE, BASED ON ASSUMED MARKET SEGMENT GROWTH RATES

AND INTELS ASSUMED MARKET SEGMENT SHARE; ESTIMATED COSTS; AND APPROPRIATE DISCOUNT RATES BASED ON THE PARTICULAR BUSINESSS WEIGHTED AVERAGE COST OF CAPITAL. OUR ESTIMATES OF MARKET SEGMENT GROWTH, OUR MARKET SEGMENT SHARE AND COSTS ARE

BASED ON HISTORICAL DATA, VARIOUS INTERNAL ESTIMATES AND A VARIETY OF EXTERNAL SOURCES, AND ARE DEVELOPED AS PART OUR ROUTINE LONG-RANGE PLANNING PROCESS. IN ADDITION TO BEING USED IN OUR GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT ANALYSIS, THE SAME ESTIMATES ARE USED IN

THE PLANNING FOR OUR LONG-TERM MANUFACTURING CAPACITY NEEDS AS PART OF OUR CAPITAL BUDGETING PROCESS AND FOR BOTH LONG-TERM AND SHORT-TERM BUSINESS PLANNING AND FORECASTING. WE TEST THE REASONABLENESS OF THE INPUTS AND OUTCOMES OF OUR DISCOUNTED

CASH FLOW ANALYSIS BY COMPARISON TO AVAILABLE AND COMPARABLE MARKET DATA. IN DETERMINING THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE REPORTING UNIT, WE MUST INCLUDE AN ALLOCATION OF OUR MANUFACTURING ASSETS BECAUSE OF THE INTERCHANGEABLE NATURE OF OUR MANUFACTURING

CAPACITY. THIS ALLOCATION IS BASED ON EACH REPORTING UNITS RELATIVE PERCENTAGE OF UTILIZATION OF OUR MANUFACTURING ASSETS. DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2003, THE COMPANY COMPLETED ITS MOST RECENT REVIEW, RESULTING IN A $611 MILLION NON-CASH

GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT CHARGE RELATED TO THE WCCG REPORTING UNIT (SEE NOTE 16: GOODWILL IN THE NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND THE WCCG DISCUSSION IN THE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS SECTION OF THIS MD&A). A

SUBSTANTIAL MAJORITY OF OUR REMAINING RECORDED GOODWILL IS RELATED TO THE ICG REPORTING UNIT. THE ESTIMATES WE USED IN OUR MOST RECENT REVIEW FOR ICG ASSUME THAT WE WILL GAIN MARKET SEGMENT SHARE IN THE FUTURE AND THAT THE COMMUNICATIONS BUSINESS

WILL EXPERIENCE A GRADUAL RECOVERY AND RETURN TO GROWTH FROM THE CURRENT TRENDS. WE MAY INCUR CHARGES FOR THE IMPAIRMENT OF GOODWILL IN THE FUTURE IF THE COMMUNICATIONS SECTOR DOES NOT RECOVER AS WE EXPECT, IF WE FAIL TO DELIVER NEW PRODUCTS FOR

ICG, IF THE PRODUCTS FAIL TO GAIN EXPECTED MARKET ACCEPTANCE, IF WE FAIL TO ACHIEVE OUR ASSUMED REVENUE GROWTH RATES OR ASSUMED GROSS MARGIN, OR IF INTEREST RATES INCREASE SIGNIFICANTLY.

NON-MARKETABLE EQUITY SECURITIES.

AT DECEMBER 27, 2003, THE CARRYING VALUE OF OUR PORTFOLIO OF STRATEGIC

INVESTMENTS IN NON-MARKETABLE EQUITY SECURITIES, EXCLUDING EQUITY DERIVATIVES, TOTALED $665 MILLION ($730 MILLION AT DECEMBER 28, 2002). UNDER OUR INTEL CAPITAL PROGRAM, WE MAKE EQUITY INVESTMENTS IN COMPANIES AROUND THE WORLD TO FURTHER OUR

STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES AND SUPPORT OUR KEY BUSINESS INITIATIVES. THE INTEL CAPITAL PROGRAM FOCUSES ON INVESTING IN COMPANIES AND INITIATIVES TO STIMULATE GROWTH IN THE INTERNET ECONOMY AND ITS INFRASTRUCTURE, CREATE NEW BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES FOR

INTEL AND EXPAND GLOBAL MARKETS FOR OUR PRODUCTS. THE INVESTMENTS MAY SUPPORT, AMONG OTHER THINGS, INTEL PRODUCT INITIATIVES, EMERGING TRENDS IN THE TECHNOLOGY INDUSTRY OR WORLDWIDE INTERNET DEPLOYMENT. THIS STRATEGIC INVESTMENT PROGRAM HELPS

ADVANCE OUR OVERALL MISSION TO BE THE PREEMINENT SUPPLIER OF BUILDING BLOCKS TO THE WORLDWIDE INTERNET ECONOMY.

WE INVEST IN COMPANIES THAT DEVELOP SOFTWARE, HARDWARE AND OTHER TECHNOLOGIES OR PROVIDE SERVICES SUPPORTING TECHNOLOGIES. OUR CURRENT INVESTMENT FOCUS

AREAS INCLUDE: ENABLING MOBILE AND INTERNET CLIENT DEVICES, HELPING TO CREATE THE DIGITAL HOME, ADVANCING HIGH- PERFORMANCE COMMUNICATIONS INFRASTRUCTURE AND DEVELOPING THE NEXT GENERATION OF SILICON PRODUCTION TECHNOLOGIES. OUR FOCUS AREAS TEND TO

DEVELOP AND CHANGE OVER TIME DUE TO RAPID ADVANCEMENTS IN TECHNOLOGY.

WE TYPICALLY INVEST IN NON-MARKETABLE EQUITY SECURITIES OF PRIVATE COMPANIES AND CONTRIBUTE A PORTION OF THE FUNDS REQUIRED FOR THEM TO GROW. OUR

INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO RANGES FROM EARLY-STAGE COMPANIES THAT ARE OFTEN STILL DEFINING THEIR STRATEGIC DIRECTION TO MORE MATURE COMPANIES WHOSE PRODUCTS OR TECHNOLOGIES MAY DIRECTLY SUPPORT AN INTEL PRODUCT OR INITIATIVE. WE INVEST FOR STRATEGIC

REASONS, WITH EACH INVESTMENT ALSO EVALUATED FOR POTENTIAL FINANCIAL RETURNS. THE PROGRAM SEEKS TO INVEST IN COMPANIES AND BUSINESSES THAT CAN SUCCEED AND HAVE AN IMPACT ON THEIR MARKET SEGMENT. HOWEVER, THESE TYPES OF INVESTMENTS INVOLVE A GREAT

DEAL OF RISK, AND THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT ANY SPECIFIC COMPANY, WHETHER AT AN EARLY OR MATURE STAGE, OR SOMEWHERE IN BETWEEN, WILL GROW OR WILL BECOME SUCCESSFUL, AND CONSEQUENTLY, WE COULD LOSE ALL OR PART OF OUR INVESTMENT. WHEN THE

STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES OF AN INVESTMENT HAVE BEEN ACHIEVED, OR IF THE INVESTMENT OR BUSINESS DIVERGES FROM OUR STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES, WE MAY DECIDE TO DISPOSE OF THE INVESTMENT. HOWEVER, OUR INVESTMENTS IN NON-MARKETABLE EQUITY SECURITIES ARE NOT

LIQUID, AND THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO DISPOSE OF THESE INVESTMENTS ON FAVORABLE TERMS OR AT ALL.

AS OF DECEMBER 27, 2003, WE HAD INVESTED $124 MILLION IN NON-VOTING STOCK OF ELPIDA MEMORY, INC., A JAPANESE PROVIDER OF DYNAMIC RANDOM ACCESS MEMORY

(DRAM). THIS INVESTMENT IS INTENDED TO HELP ALIGN ELPIDAS PRODUCT ROADMAP, AS APPROPRIATE, WITH OUR ROADMAP AND IS PART OF OUR INVESTMENT STRATEGY TO SUPPORT THE DEVELOPMENT AND SUPPLY OF DRAM PRODUCTS. NO OTHER INVESTMENT IN OUR

NON-MARKETABLE PORTFOLIO WAS INDIVIDUALLY SIGNIFICANT.

OUR

ABILITY TO RECOVER OUR STRATEGIC INVESTMENTS IN NON-MARKETABLE EQUITY SECURITIES AND TO EARN A RETURN ON THESE INVESTMENTS IS PRIMARILY DEPENDENT ON HOW SUCCESSFULLY THESE COMPANIES ARE ABLE TO EXECUTE TO THEIR BUSINESS PLANS AND HOW WELL THEIR

PRODUCTS ARE ACCEPTED, AS WELL AS THEIR ABILITY TO OBTAIN VENTURE CAPITAL FUNDING TO CONTINUE OPERATIONS, TO GROW AND TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF LIQUIDITY EVENTS. IN THE CURRENT EQUITY MARKET ENVIRONMENT, THEIR ABILITY TO OBTAIN ADDITIONAL FUNDING AS WELL

AS TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF LIQUIDITY EVENTS, SUCH AS INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERINGS (IPOS), MERGERS AND PRIVATE SALES, REMAINS CONSTRAINED.

WE REVIEW ALL OF OUR INVESTMENTS QUARTERLY FOR IMPAIRMENT; HOWEVER, FOR NON-MARKETABLE EQUITY SECURITIES, THE IMPAIRMENT ANALYSIS REQUIRES SIGNIFICANT

JUDGMENT TO IDENTIFY EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES THAT WOULD LIKELY HAVE A SIGNIFICANT ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE FAIR VALUE OF THE INVESTMENT. THE INDICATORS THAT WE USE TO IDENTIFY THOSE EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES INCLUDE (A) THE INVESTEES REVENUE AND

EARNINGS TRENDS RELATIVE TO PREDEFINED MILESTONES AND OVERALL BUSINESS PROSPECTS, (B) THE TECHNOLOGICAL FEASIBILITY OF THE INVESTEES PRODUCTS AND TECHNOLOGIES, (C) THE GENERAL MARKET CONDITIONS IN THE INVESTEES INDUSTRY, AND (D) THE

INVESTEES LIQUIDITY, DEBT RATIOS AND THE RATE AT WHICH THE INVESTEE IS USING ITS CASH.

INVESTMENTS IDENTIFIED AS HAVING AN INDICATOR OF IMPAIRMENT ARE SUBJECT TO FURTHER ANALYSIS TO DETERMINE IF THE INVESTMENT IS OTHER THAN TEMPORARILY

IMPAIRED, IN WHICH CASE WE WRITE THE INVESTMENT DOWN TO ITS IMPAIRED VALUE. WHEN AN INVESTEE IS NOT CONSIDERED VIABLE FROM A FINANCIAL OR TECHNOLOGICAL POINT OF VIEW, WE WRITE DOWN THE ENTIRE INVESTMENT SINCE WE CONSIDER THE ESTIMATED FAIR MARKET

VALUE TO BE NOMINAL. IF AN INVESTEE OBTAINS ADDITIONAL FUNDING AT A VALUATION LOWER THAN OUR CARRYING AMOUNT OR REQUIRES A NEW ROUND OF EQUITY FUNDING TO STAY IN OPERATION AND THE NEW FUNDING DOES NOT APPEAR IMMINENT, WE PRESUME THAT THE INVESTMENT

IS OTHER THAN TEMPORARILY IMPAIRED, UNLESS SPECIFIC FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE OTHERWISE.

WE HAVE EXPERIENCED SUBSTANTIAL IMPAIRMENTS IN OUR PORTFOLIO OF NON-MARKETABLE EQUITY SECURITIES AS EQUITY MARKETS DECLINED SIGNIFICANTLY OVER THE PAST

FEW YEARS. IF THE LEVEL OF IPO MARKET ACTIVITY DOES NOT INCREASE AND THE AVAILABILITY OF VENTURE CAPITAL FUNDING FOR TECHNOLOGY INVESTMENTS DOES NOT IMPROVE, OUR NON-MARKETABLE INVESTMENTS MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED. AS COMPANIES WITHIN OUR

PORTFOLIO ATTEMPT TO RAISE ADDITIONAL FUNDS, THE FUNDS MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE TO THEM OR THEY MAY RECEIVE LOWER VALUATIONS, WITH LESS FAVORABLE INVESTMENT TERMS THAN IN PREVIOUS FINANCINGS, AND THE INVESTMENTS WOULD LIKELY BECOME IMPAIRED. HOWEVER, WE

ARE NOT ABLE TO DETERMINE AT THE PRESENT TIME WHICH SPECIFIC INVESTMENTS ARE LIKELY TO BE IMPAIRED IN THE FUTURE, OR THE EXTENT OR TIMING OF INDIVIDUAL IMPAIRMENTS. IMPAIRMENTS OF INVESTMENTS IN OUR PORTFOLIO, PRIMARILY IMPAIRMENTS OF NON-MARKETABLE

EQUITY SECURITIES, WERE $319 MILLION IN 2003 ($524 MILLION IN 2002 AND $1.1 BILLION IN 2001).

INVENTORY.

THE VALUATION OF INVENTORY REQUIRES US TO ESTIMATE OBSOLETE OR EXCESS INVENTORY AS WELL AS INVENTORY THAT IS NOT OF SALEABLE QUALITY. THE DETERMINATION OF OBSOLETE OR EXCESS INVENTORY

REQUIRES US TO ESTIMATE THE FUTURE DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS WITHIN SPECIFIC TIME HORIZONS, GENERALLY SIX MONTHS OR LESS. THE ESTIMATES OF FUTURE DEMAND THAT WE USE IN THE VALUATION OF INVENTORY ARE THE BASIS FOR OUR PUBLISHED REVENUE FORECAST, WHICH

IS ALSO CONSISTENT WITH OUR SHORT-TERM MANUFACTURING PLAN. IF OUR DEMAND FORECAST FOR SPECIFIC PRODUCTS IS GREATER THAN ACTUAL DEMAND AND WE FAIL TO REDUCE MANUFACTURING OUTPUT ACCORDINGLY, WE COULD BE REQUIRED TO RECORD ADDITIONAL INVENTORY

RESERVES, WHICH WOULD HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON OUR GROSS MARGIN.

LONG-LIVED ASSETS.

WE ASSESS THE IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS WHEN EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THAT THE CARRYING

VALUE OF THE ASSETS OR THE ASSET GROUPING MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE. FACTORS THAT WE CONSIDER IN DECIDING WHEN TO PERFORM AN IMPAIRMENT REVIEW INCLUDE SIGNIFICANT UNDER-PERFORMANCE OF A BUSINESS OR PRODUCT LINE IN RELATION TO EXPECTATIONS, SIGNIFICANT

NEGATIVE INDUSTRY OR ECONOMIC TRENDS, AND SIGNIFICANT CHANGES OR PLANNED CHANGES IN OUR USE OF THE ASSETS. RECOVERABILITY OF ASSETS THAT WILL CONTINUE TO BE USED IN OUR OPERATIONS IS MEASURED BY COMPARING THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF THE ASSET GROUPING TO

THE RELATED TOTAL FUTURE NET CASH FLOWS. IF AN ASSET GROUPINGS CARRYING VALUE IS NOT RECOVERABLE THROUGH THE RELATED CASH FLOWS, THE ASSET GROUPING IS CONSIDERED TO BE IMPAIRED. THE IMPAIRMENT IS MEASURED BY THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE ASSET

GROUPINGS CARRYING AMOUNT AND ITS FAIR VALUE, BASED ON THE BEST INFORMATION AVAILABLE, INCLUDING MARKET PRICES OR DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW ANALYSIS.

IMPAIRMENTS OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS ARE DETERMINED FOR GROUPS OF ASSETS RELATED TO THE LOWEST LEVEL OF IDENTIFIABLE INDEPENDENT CASH FLOWS. DUE TO OUR ASSET

USAGE MODEL AND THE INTERCHANGEABLE NATURE OF OUR SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING CAPACITY, WE MUST MAKE SUBJECTIVE JUDGMENTS IN DETERMINING THE INDEPENDENT CASH FLOWS THAT CAN BE RELATED TO SPECIFIC ASSET GROUPINGS. IN ADDITION, AS WE MAKE

MANUFACTURING PROCESS CONVERSIONS AND OTHER FACTORY PLANNING DECISIONS, WE MUST MAKE SUBJECTIVE JUDGMENTS REGARDING THE REMAINING USEFUL LIVES OF ASSETS, PRIMARILY PROCESS-SPECIFIC SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING TOOLS AND BUILDING IMPROVEMENTS. WHEN WE

DETERMINE THAT THE USEFUL LIVES OF ASSETS ARE SHORTER THAN WE HAD ORIGINALLY ESTIMATED, AND THERE ARE SUFFICIENT CASH FLOWS TO SUPPORT THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE ASSETS, WE ACCELERATE THE RATE OF DEPRECIATION CHARGES IN ORDER TO FULLY DEPRECIATE THE

ASSETS OVER THEIR NEW SHORTER USEFUL LIVES.

INCOME

TAXES.

WE MUST MAKE CERTAIN ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS IN DETERMINING INCOME TAX EXPENSE FOR FINANCIAL STATEMENT PURPOSES. THESE ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS OCCUR IN THE CALCULATION OF CERTAIN TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, WHICH ARISE FROM

DIFFERENCES IN THE TIMING OF RECOGNITION OF REVENUE AND EXPENSE FOR TAX AND FINANCIAL STATEMENT PURPOSES.

WE MUST ASSESS THE LIKELIHOOD THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO RECOVER OUR DEFERRED TAX ASSETS. IF RECOVERY IS NOT LIKELY, WE MUST INCREASE OUR PROVISION FOR TAXES

BY RECORDING A VALUATION ALLOWANCE AGAINST THE DEFERRED TAX ASSETS THAT WE ESTIMATE WILL NOT ULTIMATELY BE RECOVERABLE. AS OF DECEMBER 27, 2003, WE BELIEVED THAT ALL OF THE DEFERRED TAX ASSETS RECORDED ON OUR BALANCE SHEET WOULD ULTIMATELY BE

RECOVERED. HOWEVER, SHOULD THERE BE A CHANGE IN OUR ABILITY TO RECOVER OUR DEFERRED TAX ASSETS, OUR TAX PROVISION WOULD INCREASE IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH WE DETERMINE THAT THE RECOVERY IS NOT PROBABLE.

IN ADDITION, THE CALCULATION OF OUR TAX LIABILITIES INVOLVES DEALING WITH

UNCERTAINTIES IN THE APPLICATION OF COMPLEX TAX REGULATIONS. WE RECOGNIZE LIABILITIES FOR ANTICIPATED TAX AUDIT ISSUES IN THE U.S. AND OTHER TAX JURISDICTIONS BASED ON OUR ESTIMATE OF WHETHER, AND THE EXTENT TO WHICH, ADDITIONAL TAXES WILL BE DUE.

IF WE ULTIMATELY DETERMINE THAT PAYMENT OF THESE AMOUNTS IS UNNECESSARY, WE REVERSE THE LIABILITY AND RECOGNIZE A TAX BENEFIT DURING THE PERIOD IN WHICH WE DETERMINE THAT THE LIABILITY IS NO LONGER NECESSARY. WE RECORD AN ADDITIONAL CHARGE IN OUR

PROVISION FOR TAXES IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH WE DETERMINE THAT THE RECORDED TAX LIABILITY IS LESS THAN WE EXPECT THE ULTIMATE ASSESSMENT TO BE. FOR A DISCUSSION OF CURRENT TAX MATTERS, SEE NOTE 21: CONTINGENCIES IN THE NOTES TO

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

OVERVIEW

IN 2003, WE SAW A SUBSTANTIAL

IMPROVEMENT IN OUR INTEL ARCHITECTURE BUSINESS COMPARED TO 2002, AND AS WE LOOK AHEAD TO THE REST OF 2004, WE ARE PLANNING FOR GROWTH IN ANNUAL REVENUE AND FURTHER PROGRESS IN OVERALL GROSS PROFIT MARGIN. OUR GROWTH CONTINUES TO BE LARGELY DEPENDENT

ON THE SUCCESS OF OUR MICROPROCESSOR BUSINESS. REVENUE FROM SALES OF MICROPROCESSORS WITHIN OUR INTEL ARCHITECTURE BUSINESS REPRESENTED APPROXIMATELY 73% OF OUR CONSOLIDATED NET REVENUE IN 2003. RAPID TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES CHARACTERIZE THE

SEMICONDUCTOR INDUSTRY. THEREFORE, WE MUST CONTINUE TO DELIVER LEADING-EDGE PRODUCTS THAT APPEAL TO USERS OF TECHNOLOGY BY INTEGRATING HIGHER PERFORMANCE AND/OR ADDED FEATURES INTO OUR PRODUCTS. IN ADDITION, GROWTH IN SALES OF MICROPROCESSORS IS

DEPENDENT ON CONTINUED SALES GROWTH IN EMERGING MARKETS IN BOTH ASIA AND EUROPE, WHICH HAVE BEEN GROWING FASTER ON A PERCENTAGE BASIS THAN OUR OTHER REGIONS. IN 2003, 72% OF OUR SALES CAME FROM GEOGRAPHIES OUTSIDE OF THE AMERICAS. FINALLY, GROWTH IN

SALES OF MICROPROCESSORS DEPENDS ON CONTINUED BUSINESS AND CONSUMER INVESTMENT IN TECHNOLOGIES THAT USE OUR MICROPROCESSORS IN MATURE MARKETS.

WE PLAN TO CONTINUE TO STREAMLINE OPERATIONS AND REFOCUS ON CORE STRATEGIC AREAS WITHIN OUR COMMUNICATIONS-RELATED BUSINESSES. IN LINE WITH THIS EFFORT,

IN DECEMBER 2003, WE ANNOUNCED THAT WE WOULD BE CONSOLIDATING COMMUNICATIONS-RELATED BUSINESSES WITHIN ICG AND WCCG INTO A SINGLE ORGANIZATION, THE INTEL COMMUNICATIONS GROUP, EFFECTIVE FOR 2004. WE BELIEVE THAT AS WIRELESS LAN AND CELLULAR

TECHNOLOGIES COME TOGETHER, THE COMBINATION OF THESE ORGANIZATIONS GIVES US THE OPPORTUNITY TO BETTER COORDINATE PRODUCT PLANNING AND CUSTOMER FOCUS. THE LOSSES IN OUR FLASH MEMORY BUSINESS HAVE BEEN DISAPPOINTING. HOWEVER, WE INTEND TO USE LEADING

TECHNOLOGY PRODUCTS AND MANUFACTURING PROCESSES TO TURN THIS BUSINESS AROUND. IN ADDITION, OUR NETWORKING BUSINESS HAS EXPERIENCED THE NEGATIVE EFFECT OF AN OVERALL DECLINE IN THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS INDUSTRY IN THE LAST FEW YEARS; HOWEVER, WE HAVE

BEEN CUTTING COSTS AND TRIMMING THE LOSSES IN THIS BUSINESS, AND BELIEVE THAT THIS MARKET SEGMENT WILL EVENTUALLY IMPROVE.

SUSTAINING OR GROWING OUR PROFITABILITY DEPENDS ON OUR ABILITY TO OBTAIN CONTINUING BENEFITS FROM THE PRODUCTIVE USE OF OUR MANUFACTURING ASSETS, IN

PARTICULAR OUR NEW EQUIPMENT USED FOR 90-NANOMETER PROCESS TECHNOLOGY AND 300MM WAFERS, AS WE BUILD MORE OF OUR MAINSTREAM PRODUCTS WITH THESE TECHNOLOGIES. WE CONSIDER OUR MANUFACTURING CAPABILITY TO BE A COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE, AND OUR SUCCESS IS

DEPENDENT ON OUR CONTINUED ABILITY TO LOWER OUR UNIT COSTS THROUGH MANUFACTURING EFFICIENCIES. BECAUSE WE HAVE HIGH FIXED COSTS, OUR PROFITABILITY COULD BE NEGATIVELY AFFECTED IF WE DO NOT ACHIEVE SUFFICIENT SALES-VOLUME GROWTH. DESPITE THE ECONOMIC

DOWNTURN OF THE LAST FEW YEARS, WE CONTINUED TO, AND CURRENTLY PLAN TO CONTINUE TO, INVEST IN CAPITAL EQUIPMENT AND INCREASE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT SPENDING WITH THE GOAL OF DELIVERING LEADING-EDGE PRODUCTS ON ADVANCED MANUFACTURING PROCESSES.

OUR NET REVENUE FOR

2003 WAS $30.1 BILLION, AN INCREASE OF 13% COMPARED TO 2002. THIS INCREASE IN NET REVENUE WAS PRIMARILY FROM OUR INTEL ARCHITECTURE BUSINESS, WHICH HAD INCREASED SALES OF MICROPROCESSORS AND CHIPSETS, ACCOMPANIED BY SLIGHTLY HIGHER NET REVENUE FOR

ICG. NET REVENUE WAS LOWER FOR WCCG.

OUR ASIA-PACIFIC

REGIONS REVENUE MADE UP THE LARGEST PORTION OF OUR TOTAL REVENUE AND INCREASED 21% IN 2003 COMPARED TO 2002, REFLECTING GROWTH IN LOCAL CONSUMPTION AND ASIAS CONTINUED GROWTH AS A GLOBAL MANUFACTURING AND DESIGN CENTER. REVENUE IN EUROPE

IMPROVED, INCREASING 12% IN 2003 COMPARED TO 2002. JAPAN EXPERIENCED SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT WITH INCREASED REVENUE OF 42%, PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY RETAIL SALES AS WELL AS HIGHER NOTEBOOK EXPORTS BY JAPANESE MANUFACTURERS. REVENUE FROM THE AMERICAS

REGION CONTINUED TO DECREASE AS A PERCENT OF OUR TOTAL REVENUE AND DECLINED 3% IN 2003 COMPARED TO 2002. IN 2003, WE CONTINUED TO EXPERIENCE GROWTH IN EMERGING MARKETS IN ASIA AND EUROPE, AND BEGAN TO SEE SOME EVIDENCE OF HIGHER TECHNOLOGY

INFRASTRUCTURE SPENDING IN MATURE MARKETS IN EUROPE AND THE U.S.

OUR OVERALL GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE INCREASED TO 56.7% FOR 2003 FROM 49.8% IN 2002. IMPROVED GROSS MARGIN WITHIN THE INTEL ARCHITECTURE BUSINESS AS WELL AS A SHIFT IN THE TOTAL COMPANY REVENUE MIX TO THE HIGHER MARGIN INTEL ARCHITECTURE

BUSINESS CONTRIBUTED TO OUR IMPROVED TOTAL GROSS MARGIN. IMPROVEMENT IN THE INTEL ARCHITECTURE GROSS MARGIN WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECLINE IN THE GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE FOR WCCG. THE GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE FOR ICG WAS FLAT IN 2003 COMPARED TO

2002. SEE THE BUSINESS OUTLOOK SECTION BELOW FOR A DISCUSSION OF GROSS MARGIN EXPECTATIONS.

OUR NET REVENUE FOR 2002 WAS $26.8 BILLION, APPROXIMATELY FLAT COMPARED TO $26.5 BILLION IN 2001. INCREASED REVENUE IN THE INTEL ARCHITECTURE BUSINESS DUE

TO STRENGTH IN SALES OF MICROPROCESSORS AND CHIPSETS WAS OFFSET BY SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER REVENUE FOR ICG. NET REVENUE FOR WCCG WAS FLAT FROM 2001 TO 2002.

IN 2002, REVENUE FROM OUR ASIA-PACIFIC REGION INCREASED 21% FROM 2001 AND SURPASSED REVENUE FROM THE AMERICAS FOR THE FIRST TIME. THE GROWTH IN ASIA WAS

OFFSET BY DECLINES IN OUR OTHER GEOGRAPHIES. JAPAN DECLINED 19% DUE TO WEAKENED ECONOMIC CONDITIONS. THE AMERICAS REGION DECREASED 8%, AND EUROPE DECREASED 6%.

OUR OVERALL GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE IN 2002 WAS APPROXIMATELY FLAT AT 49.8% COMPARED TO 49.2% IN 2001. THE INTEL ARCHITECTURE BUSINESS GROSS MARGIN

PERCENTAGE WAS ALSO RELATIVELY FLAT IN 2002 COMPARED TO 2001. WCCG EXPERIENCED A SLIGHTLY LOWER GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE WHILE ICG EXPERIENCED A SLIGHTLY HIGHER GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE. OUR GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE IN 2002 WAS ALSO NEGATIVELY IMPACTED

BY THE $106 MILLION CHARGE RELATED TO THE DECISION TO WIND DOWN OUR WEB HOSTING BUSINESS.

ARCHITECTURE REVENUE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER UNIT SALES AND TO A LESSER EXTENT DUE TO A SLIGHTLY HIGHER AVERAGE SELLING PRICE FOR MICROPROCESSORS, AS WELL AS SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER UNIT SALES OF CHIPSETS IN 2003. DURING THE YEAR, WE

RAPIDLY RAMPED THE NEW INTEL CENTRINO MOBILE TECHNOLOGY AND THE PENTIUM M PROCESSOR FOR MOBILE COMPUTERS. WE ALSO SAW INCREASED SALES OF PENTIUM 4 PROCESSORS WITH HT TECHNOLOGY AND HIGHER SALES OF INTEL XEON PROCESSORS IN THE SERVER MARKET SEGMENT.

OPERATING INCOME INCREASED BY $3.8 BILLION, OR 58%, IN 2003

COMPARED TO 2002. THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE IMPACT OF HIGHER REVENUE, LOWER UNIT COSTS FOR MICROPROCESSORS AND CHIPSETS, AND CHARGES FOR UNDER-UTILIZED FACTORY CAPACITY THAT WERE LOWER THAN IN 2002 BY APPROXIMATELY $150 MILLION. THESE

IMPROVEMENTS WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY APPROXIMATELY $390 MILLION OF HIGHER START-UP COSTS IN 2003 RELATED TO THE RAMP OF 90-NANOMETER TECHNOLOGY ON 300-MILLIMETER WAFER MANUFACTURING.

FOR 2002, NET REVENUE FOR THE INTEL ARCHITECTURE OPERATING SEGMENT INCREASED BY $870 MILLION, OR 4%, COMPARED TO 2001.

REVENUE FROM SALES OF MICROPROCESSORS INCREASED 4%, AND REVENUE FROM SALES OF CHIPSETS AND MOTHERBOARDS INCREASED 3%. THE INCREASE IN MICROPROCESSOR REVENUE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER UNIT VOLUMES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER AVERAGE SELLING PRICES.

THE INCREASE IN REVENUE FROM CHIPSETS AND MOTHERBOARDS WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER UNIT VOLUMES OF MOTHERBOARDS.

OPERATING INCOME FOR THE INTEL ARCHITECTURE BUSINESS INCREASED BY $315 MILLION, OR 5%, IN 2002 COMPARED TO 2001. THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE

IMPACT OF HIGHER REVENUE AND APPROXIMATELY $720 MILLION OF LOWER START-UP COSTS RELATED TO THE 0.13-MICRON TECHNOLOGY MANUFACTURING RAMP. THESE POSITIVE IMPACTS WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER UNIT COSTS FOR MICROPROCESSORS. OPERATING INCOME FOR

2002 WAS REDUCED BY A $155 MILLION CHARGE RELATED TO THE INTERGRAPH CORPORATION LITIGATION SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT (SEE NOTE 21: CONTINGENCIES IN THE NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS).

NET REVENUE INCREASED

BY $67 MILLION, OR 3%, IN 2003 COMPARED TO 2002. REVENUE INCREASED FOR WIRELESS CONNECTIVITY PRODUCTS, INCLUDING THE WIRELESS COMPONENT OF OUR INTEL CENTRINO MOBILE TECHNOLOGY, AND FOR EMBEDDED PROCESSING COMPONENTS. THESE INCREASES WERE PARTIALLY

OFFSET BY LOWER REVENUE FROM SALES OF TELECOMMUNICATIONS-RELATED BOARD PRODUCTS AND LOWER REVENUE FROM WIRED ETHERNET CONNECTIVITY PRODUCTS DUE TO THE CONTINUING SHIFT IN PRODUCT MIX TO LAN ON MOTHERBOARD PRODUCTS.

THE OPERATING LOSS DECREASED TO $426 MILLION IN 2003 FROM A $622 MILLION LOSS

IN 2002, PRIMARILY DUE TO A DECREASE IN OPERATING EXPENSES OF $194 MILLION IN 2003 AS WE CONTINUED OUR EFFORTS TO STREAMLINE OPERATIONS AND REFOCUS ON OUR CORE STRATEGIC AREAS. IN ADDITION, OPERATING RESULTS IMPROVED DUE TO HIGHER REVENUE FROM SALES

OF EMBEDDED PROCESSING COMPONENTS AND LOWER UNIT COSTS OF MICROCONTROLLERS. THESE IMPROVEMENTS WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE MIX SHIFT TO LOWER MARGIN WIRED ETHERNET CONNECTIVITY PRODUCTS. FINALLY, IN THE CURRENT COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT, SALES OF

WIRELESS CONNECTIVITY PRODUCTS IN SUPPORT OF EXPANDED ADOPTION OF INTEL CENTRINO MOBILE TECHNOLOGY INCREASED THE OPERATING LOSS IN 2003.

FOR 2002, NET REVENUE DECREASED BY $500 MILLION, OR 19%, COMPARED TO 2001, PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER OVERALL UNIT VOLUMES FOR TELECOMMUNICATIONS-RELATED

PRODUCTS, CONSISTENT WITH THE DECLINE IN INDUSTRY-WIDE DEMAND FOR THESE PRODUCTS. IN ADDITION, NET REVENUE FOR WIRED ETHERNET CONNECTIVITY PRODUCTS DECREASED, EVEN AS UNITS INCREASED, DUE TO THE SHIFT IN PRODUCT MIX FROM ADAPTER CARDS TO LAN ON

MOTHERBOARD PRODUCTS.

DESPITE THE DECLINE IN NET REVENUE FOR

ICG, 2002 NET OPERATING RESULTS IMPROVED, WITH A LOSS OF $622 MILLION COMPARED TO A LOSS OF $735 MILLION IN 2001. THE IMPACT OF LOWER REVENUE WAS MORE THAN OFFSET BY THE IMPACT OF OPERATING EXPENSES, WHICH WERE LOWER BY APPROXIMATELY $137 MILLION,

AS WELL AS BY REDUCED INVENTORY WRITE-DOWNS IN 2002 COMPARED TO 2001 AND A MIX SHIFT TO HIGHER MARGIN PRODUCTS, INCLUDING EMBEDDED PROCESSING COMPONENTS.

FROM SALES OF APPLICATION PROCESSORS FOR DATA-ENABLED CELLULAR PHONES AND HANDHELD COMPUTING DEVICES INCREASED.

THE OPERATING LOSS INCREASED BY $145 MILLION TO A LOSS OF $432 MILLION IN 2003 COMPARED TO A LOSS OF $287 MILLION IN 2002, PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER REVENUE

FOR FLASH MEMORY PRODUCTS AND THE IMPACT OF HIGHER INVENTORY WRITE-OFFS.

NET REVENUE WAS FLAT FROM 2001 TO 2002. REVENUE FOR FLASH MEMORY PRODUCTS WAS SLIGHTLY LOWER DUE TO A DECREASE IN AVERAGE SELLING PRICES STEMMING FROM COMPETITIVE PRICING PRESSURES, MOSTLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN

UNIT VOLUMES. REVENUE ON HIGHER VOLUMES OF APPLICATION PROCESSORS AND BASEBAND CHIPSETS OFFSET THE LOWER REVENUE FROM FLASH MEMORY PRODUCTS.

THE NET OPERATING LOSS INCREASED BY $38 MILLION TO A LOSS OF $287 MILLION IN 2002 COMPARED TO A LOSS OF $249 MILLION IN 2001. LOWER AVERAGE SELLING PRICES

IN 2002 FOR FLASH MEMORY PRODUCTS WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE IMPACT OF CHARGES FOR UNDER-UTILIZED FACTORY CAPACITY THAT WERE REDUCED BY APPROXIMATELY $170 MILLION. HIGHER REVENUE AND LOWER COSTS FOR APPLICATION PROCESSORS AND BASEBAND CHIPSETS

OFFSET A PORTION OF THE NEGATIVE IMPACT FOR FLASH MEMORY PRODUCTS.

MARKETING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES WERE FLAT IN 2003 COMPARED TO 2002. WE LOWERED OUR DISCRETIONARY SPENDING AND OTHER EXPENSES AS WE REDUCED

HEADCOUNT AND REFOCUSED ON CORE STRATEGIC AREAS. THIS DECREASE IN EXPENSES WAS OFFSET BY HIGHER MARKETING EXPENSES DUE TO THE LAUNCH OF THE INTEL CENTRINO MOBILE TECHNOLOGY BRAND IN 2003; INCREASED PROFIT-DEPENDENT COMPENSATION EXPENSES; AND HIGHER

SPENDING FOR THE INTEL INSIDE

®

COOPERATIVE

ADVERTISING PROGRAM, PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER MICROPROCESSOR REVENUE. MARKETING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES DECREASED $130 MILLION, OR 3%, IN 2002 COMPARED TO 2001, PRIMARILY DUE TO THE IMPACT OF LOWER SPENDING WITHIN ICG AND FOR CERTAIN NEW

BUSINESS INITIATIVES AS WE REDUCED HEADCOUNT OR EXITED CERTAIN BUSINESSES, AS WELL AS LOWER OVERALL DISCRETIONARY SPENDING RELATED TO COST CONTAINMENT PROGRAMS. THE SPENDING DECREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER EXPENSES FOR THE INTEL INSIDE

COOPERATIVE ADVERTISING PROGRAM DUE TO HIGHER MICROPROCESSOR REVENUE AND THE IMPACT OF OUR CUSTOMERS USING A SLIGHTLY HIGHER PERCENTAGE OF THEIR AVAILABLE PROGRAM FUNDS.

DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2003, THE COMPANY COMPLETED ITS ANNUAL IMPAIRMENT REVIEW FOR GOODWILL AND FOUND INDICATORS OF

IMPAIRMENT FOR THE WCCG REPORTING UNIT. THE WCCG BUSINESS, COMPRISED PRIMARILY OF FLASH MEMORY PRODUCTS AND CELLULAR BASEBAND CHIPSETS, HAS NOT PERFORMED AS MANAGEMENT HAD EXPECTED. IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2003, IT BECAME APPARENT THAT WCCG WAS NOW

EXPECTED TO GROW MORE SLOWLY THAN PREVIOUSLY PROJECTED. A SLOWER-THAN-EXPECTED ROLLOUT OF PRODUCTS AND SLOWER-THAN-EXPECTED CUSTOMER ACCEPTANCE OF OUR PRODUCTS IN THE BASEBAND CHIPSET BUSINESS, AS WELL AS A DELAY IN THE TRANSITION TO NEXT-GENERATION

PHONE NETWORKS, HAVE PUSHED OUT THE FORECASTS FOR SALES OF PRODUCTS FOR HIGH-END DATA CELL PHONES. THESE FACTORS RESULTED IN LOWER GROWTH EXPECTATIONS FOR THE REPORTING UNIT AND TRIGGERED A $611 MILLION CHARGE FOR IMPAIRMENT OF GOODWILL. ALSO DURING

2003, THE COMPANY RECORDED A $6 MILLION CHARGE FOR IMPAIRMENT OF THE GOODWILL RELATED TO ONE OF THE COMPANYS SEED BUSINESSES. SEED BUSINESSES SUPPORT THE COMPANYS STRATEGIC INITIATIVES. IN 2001, GOODWILL OF $1.6 BILLION WAS AMORTIZED,

AND THERE WAS A $98 MILLION CHARGE FOR GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT RELATED TO PRIOR-YEAR ACQUISITIONS. BEGINNING IN 2002, GOODWILL IS NO LONGER AMORTIZED.

AMORTIZATION AND IMPAIRMENT OF ACQUISITION-RELATED INTANGIBLES AND COSTS WAS $301 MILLION IN 2003, DECREASING FROM $548 MILLION IN 2002 AND $628 MILLION

IN 2001, AS INTANGIBLE ASSETS RELATED TO PRIOR ACQUISITIONS BECAME FULLY AMORTIZED. THE 2002 AMOUNT INCLUDED $127 MILLION OF IMPAIRMENTS ($26 MILLION IN 2001). NO IMPAIRMENTS WERE RECORDED IN 2003. AMORTIZATION AND IMPAIRMENT OF BOTH GOODWILL AND

ACQUISITION-RELATED COSTS FOR ALL PERIODS ARE INCLUDED IN THE CALCULATION OF THE OPERATING LOSS FOR THE ALL OTHER CATEGORY FOR SEGMENT REPORTING PURPOSES.

LOSSES ON EQUITY

SECURITIES AND CERTAIN EQUITY DERIVATIVES FOR 2003 WERE $283 MILLION COMPARED TO $372 MILLION FOR 2002. THE NET LOSS FOR 2003 INCLUDED IMPAIRMENT CHARGES OF APPROXIMATELY $319 MILLION, PRIMARILY RELATED TO NON-MARKETABLE EQUITY SECURITIES, COMPARED

TO IMPAIRMENT CHARGES OF APPROXIMATELY $524 MILLION IN 2002. THE DECREASE IN THE IMPAIRMENT CHARGES IN 2003 REFLECTED THE DECREASE IN THE TOTAL CARRYING AMOUNT OF THE NON-MARKETABLE EQUITY INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO. THE IMPAIRMENT CHARGES IN 2002 WERE

PARTIALLY OFFSET BY NET GAINS OF APPROXIMATELY $57 MILLION RELATED TO EQUITY SECURITY TRADING ASSETS AND $110 MILLION OF NET GAINS ON RELATED EQUITY DERIVATIVES. THE $57 MILLION NET GAINS INCLUDED A GAIN OF APPROXIMATELY $120 MILLION, RESULTING FROM

THE DESIGNATION OF FORMERLY RESTRICTED EQUITY INVESTMENTS AS TRADING ASSETS AS THEY BECAME MARKETABLE. THE CUMULATIVE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THEIR COST AND FAIR MARKET VALUE AT THE TIME THEY BECAME MARKETABLE WAS RECORDED AS A GAIN IN 2002. FOR 2001,

THE NET LOSS OF $466 MILLION INCLUDED IMPAIRMENTS OF $1.1 BILLION, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY NET GAINS ON TRANSACTIONS OF $517 MILLION AND NET MARK-TO-MARKET GAINS ON EQUITY SECURITY TRADING ASSETS AND DERIVATIVES OF $90 MILLION.

OUR EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE WAS 24.2% IN 2003, 25.9% IN 2002

AND 40.9% IN 2001. THE DECREASE IN THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE IN 2003 WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTED TO TAX BENEFITS OF $758 MILLION RELATED TO DIVESTITURES THAT CLOSED DURING THE YEAR. ALTHOUGH THE PRE-TAX LOSSES ON THE DIVESTITURES FOR FINANCIAL STATEMENT

PURPOSES WERE NOT SIGNIFICANT, THE COMPANY WAS ABLE TO RECOGNIZE TAX LOSSES BECAUSE THE TAX BASIS IN THE STOCK OF THE COMPANIES SOLD EXCEEDED THE BOOK BASIS. THE IMPACT OF THESE BENEFITS WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE NON-DEDUCTIBLE GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT

AND A HIGHER PERCENTAGE OF PROFITS IN HIGHER TAX JURISDICTIONS. THE DECREASE IN THE EFFECTIVE RATE IN 2002 COMPARED TO 2001 WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTED TO A DECREASE IN NON-DEDUCTIBLE ACQUISITION-RELATED COSTS, INCLUDING AMORTIZATION OF GOODWILL, AND

TAX BENEFITS OF $75 MILLION RELATED TO DIVESTITURES DURING 2002, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A GREATER PORTION OF OUR PROFITS BEING GENERATED IN HIGHER TAX JURISDICTIONS. SEE BUSINESS OUTLOOK FOR A DISCUSSION OF OUR INCOME TAX RATE EXPECTATIONS.

FINANCIAL CONDITION

OUR

FINANCIAL CONDITION REMAINS STRONG. AT DECEMBER 27, 2003, CASH, SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS AND FIXED INCOME INSTRUMENTS INCLUDED IN TRADING ASSETS TOTALED $15.9 BILLION, UP FROM $12.2 BILLION AT DECEMBER 28, 2002. AT DECEMBER 27, 2003, TOTAL SHORT-TERM

AND LONG-TERM DEBT WAS $1.2 BILLION AND REPRESENTED 3% OF STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY. AT DECEMBER 28, 2002, TOTAL DEBT WAS $1.4 BILLION AND REPRESENTED 4% OF STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY.

FOR 2003, CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES WAS $11.5 BILLION, COMPARED TO $9.1 BILLION IN 2002 AND $8.8 BILLION IN

2001. CASH WAS PROVIDED BY NET INCOME ADJUSTED FOR NON-CASH-RELATED ITEMS. WORKING CAPITAL USES OF CASH INCLUDED INCREASES IN ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND INVENTORIES, AND A DECREASE IN INCOME TAXES PAYABLE. ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE INCREASED OVER DECEMBER

2002 LEVELS, PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER REVENUE. THE DAYS SALES OUTSTANDING ALSO INCREASED TO 36 DAYS FROM 34 DAYS AT DECEMBER 2002. FOR 2003, OUR THREE LARGEST CUSTOMERS ACCOUNTED FOR APPROXIMATELY 42% OF NET REVENUE, WITH ONE OF THESE CUSTOMERS

ACCOUNTING FOR APPROXIMATELY 19% OF REVENUE AND ANOTHER CUSTOMER ACCOUNTING FOR APPROXIMATELY 15%. FOR 2002, OUR THREE LARGEST CUSTOMERS ACCOUNTED FOR APPROXIMATELY 38% OF NET REVENUE (35% OF NET REVENUE FOR 2001). ADDITIONALLY, THESE THREE LARGEST

CUSTOMERS ACCOUNTED FOR APPROXIMATELY 43% OF NET ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AT DECEMBER 27, 2003 (APPROXIMATELY 39% AT DECEMBER 28, 2002 AND DECEMBER 29, 2001). OVERALL INVENTORY LEVELS WERE HIGHER BY 11% AT THE END OF 2003 COMPARED TO 2002 AS WE RAMPED

NEW PRODUCTS FOR SALE IN 2004. THE DECREASE IN THE ACCRUAL FOR INCOME TAXES PAYABLE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE IMPACT OF TAX BENEFITS RELATED TO DIVESTITURES IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2003. WORKING CAPITAL SOURCES OF CASH INCLUDED AN INCREASE IN

ACCRUED COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS, LARGELY DUE TO HIGHER ACCRUALS FOR EMPLOYEE BONUSES RELATED TO OUR HIGHER LEVEL OF PROFITABILITY IN 2003.

WE USED $7.1 BILLION IN NET CASH FOR INVESTING ACTIVITIES DURING 2003, COMPARED TO $5.8 BILLION DURING 2002 AND $330 MILLION DURING 2001. THE INCREASE IN

CASH GENERATED FROM OPERATIONS COMPARED TO 2002 RESULTED IN NET PURCHASES OF AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE INVESTMENTS IN 2003. IMPROVED CORPORATE CREDIT PROFILES FACILITATED A SLIGHT SHIFT IN OUR PORTFOLIO OF INVESTMENTS IN DEBT SECURITIES TO LONGER TERM

MATURITIES. ADDITIONALLY, DURING 2003 WE USED $450 MILLION IN CASH TO ACQUIRE STOCK RIGHTS EXCHANGEABLE INTO APPROXIMATELY 33.9 MILLION SHARES OF MICRON TECHNOLOGY, INC. CAPITAL EXPENDITURES DECREASED TO $3.7 BILLION IN 2003 AS WE CONTINUED TO

INVEST IN CAPITAL EQUIPMENT AND CONSTRUCTION, PRIMARILY FOR ADDITIONAL MICROPROCESSOR MANUFACTURING CAPACITY, BUT AT A LOWER RATE THAN IN THE PRIOR TWO YEARS. CAPITAL EXPENDITURES WERE $4.7 BILLION IN 2002 AND $7.3 BILLION IN 2001. THE INCREASE IN

CASH USED FOR INVESTING ACTIVITIES IN 2002 COMPARED TO 2001 REFLECTED THE RELATIVELY LARGE NET SALES AND MATURITIES OF AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE INVESTMENTS THAT OCCURRED IN 2001.

WE USED $3.9 BILLION IN NET CASH FOR FINANCING ACTIVITIES IN 2003, RELATIVELY FLAT COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR, WHICH HAD

BEEN UP SLIGHTLY COMPARED TO 2001. THE MAJOR FINANCING USE OF CASH IN ALL THREE YEARS WAS FOR THE REPURCHASE OF SHARES. IN 2003, WE PURCHASED 176 MILLION SHARES OF COMMON STOCK FOR $4 BILLION ($4 BILLION IN 2002 AND 2001). AT DECEMBER 27, 2003,

APPROXIMATELY 414 MILLION SHARES REMAINED AVAILABLE FOR REPURCHASE UNDER THE EXISTING REPURCHASE AUTHORIZATION. ANOTHER MAJOR FINANCING USE OF CASH IN ALL THREE YEARS WAS FOR THE PAYMENT OF DIVIDENDS. PAYMENT OF DIVIDENDS WAS $524 MILLION IN 2003

($533 MILLION IN 2002 AND $538 MILLION IN 2001). IN JANUARY 2004, OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS APPROVED AN INCREASE IN THE QUARTERLY CASH DIVIDEND FROM $0.02 PER SHARE TO $0.04 PER SHARE, EFFECTIVE FOR THE FIRST-QUARTER 2004 DIVIDEND. FINANCING SOURCES OF

CASH DURING 2003 WERE PRIMARILY $967 MILLION IN PROCEEDS FROM THE SALE OF SHARES PURSUANT TO EMPLOYEE STOCK BENEFIT PLANS ($681 MILLION IN 2002 AND $762 MILLION IN 2001).

ANOTHER POTENTIAL SOURCE OF LIQUIDITY IS AUTHORIZED BORROWINGS, INCLUDING COMMERCIAL PAPER, OF $3 BILLION. MAXIMUM

BORROWINGS UNDER OUR COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAM DURING 2003 WERE APPROXIMATELY $30 MILLION, ALTHOUGH NO COMMERCIAL PAPER WAS OUTSTANDING AT THE END OF THE PERIOD. WE ALSO MAINTAIN THE ABILITY TO ISSUE AN AGGREGATE OF APPROXIMATELY $1.4 BILLION IN

DEBT, EQUITY AND OTHER SECURITIES UNDER U.S. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION SHELF REGISTRATION STATEMENTS.

WE BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE THE FINANCIAL RESOURCES NEEDED TO MEET BUSINESS REQUIREMENTS FOR THE NEXT 12 MONTHS, INCLUDING CAPITAL EXPENDITURES FOR THE

EXPANSION OR UPGRADING OF WORLDWIDE MANUFACTURING AND ASSEMBLY AND TEST CAPACITY, WORKING CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS, THE DIVIDEND PROGRAM, POTENTIAL STOCK REPURCHASES AND POTENTIAL FUTURE ACQUISITIONS OR STRATEGIC INVESTMENTS.

OTHER PURCHASE OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS INCLUDE PAYMENTS DUE UNDER VARIOUS TYPES OF LICENSES AND NON-CONTINGENT JOINT

FUNDING OBLIGATIONS. JOINT FUNDING OBLIGATIONS ARE AGREEMENTS TO FUND VARIOUS PROJECTS WITH OTHER COMPANIES, SUCH AS CO-MARKETING AND CO-DEVELOPMENT INITIATIVES.

TOTAL DOES NOT INCLUDE CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS RECORDED ON THE BALANCE SHEET AS CURRENT LIABILITIES, OR CERTAIN PURCHASE

OBLIGATIONS AS DISCUSSED BELOW.

PURCHASE ORDERS OR CONTRACTS FOR THE PURCHASE OF RAW MATERIALS AND OTHER GOODS AND SERVICES ARE NOT INCLUDED IN THE TABLE ABOVE. WE ARE NOT ABLE TO DETERMINE THE AGGREGATE AMOUNT OF SUCH PURCHASE ORDERS THAT REPRESENT CONTRACTUAL

OBLIGATIONS, AS PURCHASE ORDERS MAY REPRESENT AUTHORIZATIONS TO PURCHASE RATHER THAN BINDING AGREEMENTS. FOR THE PURPOSES OF THIS TABLE, CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS FOR PURCHASE OF GOODS OR SERVICES ARE DEFINED AS AGREEMENTS THAT ARE ENFORCEABLE AND

LEGALLY BINDING ON INTEL AND THAT SPECIFY ALL SIGNIFICANT TERMS, INCLUDING: FIXED OR MINIMUM QUANTITIES TO BE PURCHASED; FIXED, MINIMUM OR VARIABLE PRICE PROVISIONS; AND THE APPROXIMATE TIMING OF THE TRANSACTION. OUR PURCHASE ORDERS ARE BASED ON OUR

CURRENT MANUFACTURING NEEDS AND ARE FULFILLED BY OUR VENDORS WITHIN SHORT TIME HORIZONS. WE DO NOT HAVE SIGNIFICANT AGREEMENTS FOR THE PURCHASE OF RAW MATERIALS OR OTHER GOODS SPECIFYING MINIMUM QUANTITIES OR SET PRICES THAT EXCEED OUR EXPECTED

REQUIREMENTS FOR THREE MONTHS. WE ALSO ENTER INTO CONTRACTS FOR OUTSOURCED SERVICES; HOWEVER, THE OBLIGATIONS UNDER THESE CONTRACTS WERE NOT SIGNIFICANT AND THE CONTRACTS GENERALLY CONTAIN CLAUSES ALLOWING FOR CANCELLATION WITHOUT SIGNIFICANT

PENALTY.

CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS THAT ARE CONTINGENT UPON THE

ACHIEVEMENT OF CERTAIN MILESTONES ARE NOT INCLUDED IN THE TABLE ABOVE. THESE INCLUDE CONTINGENT JOINT FUNDING OBLIGATIONS, MILESTONE-BASED EQUITY INVESTMENT FUNDING, AND ACQUISITION-RELATED DEFERRED CASH COMPENSATION CONTINGENT ON FUTURE EMPLOYMENT.

THESE ARRANGEMENTS ARE NOT CONSIDERED CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS UNTIL THE MILESTONE IS MET BY THE THIRD PARTY. AS OF DECEMBER 27, 2003, ASSUMING ALL FUTURE MILESTONES WERE MET, ADDITIONAL REQUIRED PAYMENTS WOULD BE APPROXIMATELY $60 MILLION.

THE EXPECTED TIMING OF PAYMENT OF THE OBLIGATIONS DISCUSSED

ABOVE IS ESTIMATED BASED ON CURRENT INFORMATION. TIMING OF PAYMENTS AND ACTUAL AMOUNTS PAID MAY BE DIFFERENT DEPENDING ON THE TIME OF RECEIPT OF GOODS OR SERVICES OR CHANGES TO AGREED-UPON AMOUNTS FOR SOME OBLIGATIONS. AMOUNTS DISCLOSED AS

CONTINGENT OR MILESTONE-BASED OBLIGATIONS ARE DEPENDENT ON THE ACHIEVEMENT OF THE MILESTONES OR THE OCCURRENCE OF THE CONTINGENT EVENTS AND CAN VARY SIGNIFICANTLY.

OFF-BALANCE-SHEET ARRANGEMENTS

AS OF DECEMBER 27, 2003, WE DID NOT HAVE ANY SIGNIFICANT OFF-BALANCE-SHEET ARRANGEMENTS, AS DEFINED IN ITEM 303(A)(4)(II) OF SEC REGULATION S-K.

EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTIONS

OUR STOCK OPTION PROGRAM IS A BROAD-BASED, LONG-TERM RETENTION PROGRAM THAT IS INTENDED TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN TALENTED EMPLOYEES AND ALIGN STOCKHOLDER AND EMPLOYEE INTERESTS. THE PROGRAM CURRENTLY CONSISTS OF TWO PLANS: ONE UNDER WHICH

OFFICERS, KEY EMPLOYEES AND NON-EMPLOYEE DIRECTORS MAY BE GRANTED OPTIONS TO PURCHASE SHARES OF OUR STOCK (1984 PLAN), AND A BROAD-BASED PLAN UNDER WHICH OPTIONS MAY BE GRANTED TO ALL EMPLOYEES OTHER THAN OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS (1997 PLAN).

SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR EMPLOYEES PARTICIPATE IN ONE OF THE PLANS. OPTIONS GRANTED BY THE COMPANY EXPIRE NO LATER THAN 10 YEARS FROM THE GRANT DATE. DURING 2003, OPTIONS GRANTED TO EXISTING AND NEWLY HIRED EMPLOYEES GENERALLY VEST IN INCREMENTS

OVER FOUR OR FIVE YEARS FROM THE DATE OF GRANT, AND CERTAIN GRANTS TO KEY EMPLOYEES HAVE DELAYED VESTING GENERALLY BEGINNING SIX YEARS FROM THE DATE OF GRANT. OUR 1984 STOCK OPTION PLAN, AS AMENDED, EXPIRES IN MAY 2004, AND OUR 1997 STOCK OPTION

PLAN, AS AMENDED, EXPIRES IN JANUARY 2007. WE PRESENTLY EXPECT TO PROPOSE A NEW EQUITY PLAN FOR STOCKHOLDER VOTE AT OUR MAY 2004 ANNUAL STOCKHOLDERS MEETING. CONTINGENT ON STOCKHOLDER APPROVAL, THIS NEW EQUITY PLAN WOULD REPLACE BOTH THE

EXPIRING 1984 PLAN AND THE 1997 PLAN, WHICH WOULD BE TERMINATED EARLY.

WE HAVE A GOAL TO KEEP THE POTENTIAL INCREMENTAL DILUTION RELATED TO OUR OPTION PROGRAM TO A LONG-TERM AVERAGE OF LESS THAN 2% ANNUALLY. THE DILUTION PERCENTAGE IS CALCULATED USING THE NEW OPTION GRANTS FOR THE YEAR, NET OF OPTIONS

FORFEITED BY EMPLOYEES LEAVING THE COMPANY AND OPTIONS EXPIRED, DIVIDED BY THE TOTAL OUTSTANDING SHARES AT THE BEGINNING OF THE YEAR.

OPTIONS GRANTED TO EMPLOYEES, INCLUDING OFFICERS, AND NON-EMPLOYEE DIRECTORS FROM 1999 THROUGH 2003 ARE SUMMARIZED AS FOLLOWS.

EXECUTIVE OFFICERS SERVING AT THE END OF EACH YEAR PRESENTED.

IN ACCORDANCE WITH A POLICY ESTABLISHED BY THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS, TOTAL OPTIONS GRANTED TO THE LISTED OFFICERS MAY NOT EXCEED 5% OF TOTAL OPTIONS GRANTED IN ANY YEAR. DURING 2003,

OPTIONS GRANTED TO LISTED OFFICERS AMOUNTED TO 2.4% OF THE GRANTS MADE TO ALL EMPLOYEES. IN 2003 AND 2002, IN ADDITION TO GRANTS MADE IN CONNECTION WITH ANNUAL PERFORMANCE REVIEWS, WE MADE FURTHER GRANTS TO KEY OFFICERS, INCLUDING LISTED OFFICERS,

AND OTHER SENIOR-LEVEL EMPLOYEES IN RECOGNITION OF THEIR FUTURE POTENTIAL IN LEADING THE COMPANY. ALL STOCK OPTION GRANTS TO EXECUTIVE OFFICERS ARE MADE AFTER A REVIEW BY, AND WITH THE APPROVAL OF, THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE. ALL MEMBERS OF THE

COMPENSATION COMMITTEE ARE INDEPENDENT DIRECTORS, AS DEFINED IN THE APPLICABLE RULES FOR ISSUERS TRADED ON THE NASDAQ STOCK MARKET*.

FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING STOCK OPTION PLAN ACTIVITY FOR THE PAST THREE YEARS, SEE THE RECONCILIATION OF OPTIONS OUTSTANDING IN NOTE 12.

EMPLOYEE STOCK BENEFIT PLANS IN NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. INFORMATION REGARDING OUR STOCK OPTION PLANS SHOULD BE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE INFORMATION APPEARING UNDER THE HEADING REPORT OF THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE

BUSINESS OUTLOOK

AS WE

LOOK AHEAD TO THE REST OF 2004, WE ARE PLANNING FOR GROWTH IN ANNUAL REVENUE AND FURTHER PROGRESS IN GROSS PROFIT MARGIN. WE EXPECT CONTINUED GROWTH IN THE TOTAL NUMBER OF COMPUTERS USING THE INTEL PENTIUM 4 PROCESSOR AS WELL AS INCREASING

ACCEPTANCE OF OUR PENTIUM M PROCESSOR, THE PROCESSOR INTEGRAL TO INTEL CENTRINO MOBILE TECHNOLOGY. DEMAND FOR OUR FLASH MEMORY PRODUCTS IS UNCERTAIN IN THE HIGHLY COMPETITIVE CELLULAR HANDSET MARKET SEGMENT. REVENUE GROWTH FOR OUR FLASH MEMORY

PRODUCTS IS LARGELY DEPENDENT ON CUSTOMER DEMAND FOR HIGHER DENSITY FLASH MEMORY AND CONTINUED END USER ADOPTION OF NEW LEADING-EDGE CELLULAR HANDSETS. THE OUTLOOK FOR THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS INDUSTRY CONTINUES TO BE SOFT. IN THIS ENVIRONMENT,

REVENUE GROWTH FOR OUR NETWORKING AND COMMUNICATIONS BUSINESS IS LARGELY DEPENDENT ON OUR SECURING DESIGN WINS FOR NEW PRODUCTS, AND OEMS TAKING THESE PRODUCT DESIGNS TO PRODUCTION.

OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS ARE SUBSTANTIALLY DEPENDENT ON SALES OF MICROPROCESSORS AND RELATED COMPONENTS BY THE INTEL

ARCHITECTURE OPERATING SEGMENT. REVENUE IS PARTLY A FUNCTION OF THE MIX OF MICROPROCESSOR TYPES AND SPEEDS SOLD, AS WELL AS THE MIX OF RELATED CHIPSETS AND MOTHERBOARDS, ALL OF WHICH ARE DIFFICULT TO FORECAST. BECAUSE OF THE WIDE PRICE DIFFERENCES

AMONG PERFORMANCE DESKTOP, VALUE DESKTOP, MOBILE AND SERVER MICROPROCESSORS, THE MIX OF TYPES OF MICROPROCESSORS SOLD AFFECTS THE AVERAGE PRICE THAT WE WILL REALIZE AND HAS A LARGE IMPACT ON OUR REVENUE AND GROSS MARGIN. MICROPROCESSOR REVENUE IS

ALSO DEPENDENT ON THE AVAILABILITY OF OTHER PARTS OF THE SYSTEM PLATFORM, INCLUDING CHIPSETS, MOTHERBOARDS, OPERATING SYSTEM SOFTWARE AND APPLICATION SOFTWARE. REVENUE IS ALSO AFFECTED BY OUR SALES OF OTHER SEMICONDUCTOR AND NON-SEMICONDUCTOR

PRODUCTS, AND IS SUBJECT TO THE IMPACT OF ECONOMIC CONDITIONS IN VARIOUS GEOGRAPHIC REGIONS.

OUR GROSS MARGIN EXPECTATION FOR 2004 IS 62% PLUS OR MINUS A FEW POINTS. THE 62% MIDPOINT IS FIVE POINTS HIGHER THAN THE 2003 GROSS MARGIN OF 57%. THE GROSS MARGIN EXPECTATION REFLECTS THE SUBSTANTIAL YEAR-TO-YEAR

GROWTH THAT WE HAVE SEEN IN THE INTEL ARCHITECTURE BUSINESS AND THE IMPACT OF SPREADING OUR FIXED COSTS OVER A GREATER NUMBER OF UNITS. GROSS MARGIN SHOULD ALSO BENEFIT FROM THE PRODUCTIVE USE OF 90-NANOMETER TECHNOLOGY AND 300MM WAFERS, AS WE BUILD

MORE OF OUR MAINSTREAM PRODUCTS WITH THESE TECHNOLOGIES. OUR GROSS MARGIN VARIES PRIMARILY WITH REVENUE LEVELS, WHICH ARE DEPENDENT ON UNIT VOLUMES AND PRICES AS WELL AS THE MIX OF TYPES AND SPEEDS OF PROCESSORS SOLD, AND THE MIX OF MICROPROCESSORS,

RELATED CHIPSETS AND MOTHERBOARDS, AND OTHER SEMICONDUCTOR AND NON-SEMICONDUCTOR PRODUCTS. VARIABILITY OF OTHER FACTORS WILL ALSO CONTINUE TO AFFECT COST OF SALES AND THE GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE, INCLUDING UNIT COSTS AND YIELD ISSUES ASSOCIATED WITH

PRODUCTION AT OUR FACTORIES, TIMING AND EXECUTION OF THE MANUFACTURING RAMP INCLUDING THE RAMP OF THE 90-NANOMETER PROCESS TECHNOLOGY ON 300MM WAFERS, EXCESS MANUFACTURING CAPACITY, THE REUSABILITY OF FACTORY EQUIPMENT, IMPAIRMENT OF MANUFACTURING

OR ASSEMBLY AND TEST ASSETS, EXCESS INVENTORY, INVENTORY OBSOLESCENCE AND VARIATIONS IN INVENTORY VALUATION.

WE HAVE SIGNIFICANTLY EXPANDED OUR SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING AND ASSEMBLY AND TEST CAPACITY OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS, AND WE CONTINUE TO PLAN CAPACITY

BASED ON THE ASSUMED CONTINUED SUCCESS OF OUR OVERALL STRATEGY AND THE ACCEPTANCE OF OUR PRODUCTS IN SPECIFIC MARKET SEGMENTS. WE CURRENTLY EXPECT THAT CAPITAL SPENDING WILL BE BETWEEN $3.6 BILLION AND $4.0 BILLION IN 2004, COMPARED TO $3.7 BILLION

IN 2003. THE MIDPOINT OF THIS RANGE, $3.8 BILLION, IS ONLY SLIGHTLY HIGHER THAN IN 2003. MOST OF THE CAPITAL SPENDING FOR 2004 WILL GO TO BUILDING OR EQUIPPING OUR 300MM WAFER FACILITIES. THE EFFICIENCIES OF 300MM WAFERS TRANSLATE INTO MORE CAPACITY

FOR LESS INVESTED CAPITAL. IN TERMS OF END USE, ABOUT 85% OF THE BUDGET IS DIRECTED TO MANUFACTURING CAPABILITY, THE SAME PORTION AS IN 2003. WE EXPECT MORE THAN HALF OF THE CAPITAL SPENDING TO GO TOWARD FABRICATION (FAB) MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT,

AND MORE THAN A QUARTER TO LAND AND CONSTRUCTION. THE REMAINING PORTION IS EXPECTED TO BE SPENT ON OTHER MACHINERY AND EQUIPMENT. IN TERMS OF TECHNOLOGY, THE EMPHASIS IN CAPITAL SPENDING IS SHIFTING TO SMALLER GEOMETRIES. OVER 60% OF THE 2004 BUDGET

FOR FAB MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT IS EXPECTED TO BE INVESTED IN MANUFACTURING PROCESSES OF 65 NANOMETER AND SMALLER. THIS CAPITAL SPENDING PLAN IS DEPENDENT ON EXPECTATIONS REGARDING PRODUCTION EFFICIENCIES AND DELIVERY TIMES OF VARIOUS MACHINERY AND

EQUIPMENT, AND CONSTRUCTION SCHEDULES FOR NEW FACILITIES. IF THE DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS DOES NOT GROW AND CONTINUE TO MOVE TOWARD HIGHER PERFORMANCE PRODUCTS IN THE VARIOUS MARKET SEGMENTS, REVENUE AND GROSS MARGIN WOULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED,

MANUFACTURING AND/OR ASSEMBLY AND TEST CAPACITY WOULD BE UNDER-UTILIZED, AND THE RATE OF CAPITAL SPENDING COULD BE FURTHER REDUCED. WE COULD BE REQUIRED TO RECORD AN IMPAIRMENT OF OUR MANUFACTURING OR ASSEMBLY AND TEST EQUIPMENT AND/OR FACILITIES,

OR FACTORY PLANNING DECISIONS MAY CAUSE US TO RECORD ACCELERATED DEPRECIATION. HOWEVER, IN THE LONG TERM, REVENUE AND GROSS MARGIN MAY ALSO BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED IF WE DO NOT ADD CAPACITY FAST ENOUGH TO MEET INCREASED MARKET DEMAND.

DEPRECIATION FOR 2004 IS EXPECTED TO BE APPROXIMATELY $4.6 BILLION, COMPARED

TO $4.7 BILLION IN 2003.

OUR INDUSTRY IS CHARACTERIZED BY VERY

SHORT PRODUCT LIFE CYCLES, AND OUR CONTINUED SUCCESS IS DEPENDENT ON TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCEMENT, INCLUDING DEVELOPING AND IMPLEMENTING NEW PROCESSES AND STRATEGIC PRODUCTS FOR SPECIFIC MARKET SEGMENTS. BECAUSE WE CONSIDER IT IMPERATIVE TO MAINTAIN A

STRONG RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM, SPENDING FOR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT IN 2004 IS

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

(CONTINUED)

EXPECTED TO INCREASE TO APPROXIMATELY $4.8 BILLION FROM $4.4 BILLION IN 2003. THE EXPECTED INCREASE IS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY DEVELOPMENT OF OUR NEXT-GENERATION 65-NANOMETER PROCESS TECHNOLOGY, AS WELL AS DESIGNING

FUTURE MICROPROCESSORS AND COMMUNICATIONS INITIATIVES. WE ALSO INTEND TO CONTINUE SPENDING TO PROMOTE OUR PRODUCTS AND TO INCREASE THE VALUE OF OUR PRODUCT BRANDS.

BASED ON ACQUISITIONS COMPLETED THROUGH FEBRUARY 18, 2004, WE EXPECT AMORTIZATION OF ACQUISITION-RELATED INTANGIBLES AND

COSTS TO BE APPROXIMATELY $170 MILLION IN 2004.

WE CURRENTLY

EXPECT OUR TAX RATE TO BE APPROXIMATELY 32% FOR 2004. THE ESTIMATED EFFECTIVE TAX RATE IS BASED ON CURRENT TAX LAW AND THE CURRENT EXPECTED INCOME, AND ASSUMES THAT THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO RECEIVE THE TAX BENEFIT FOR EXPORT SALES (SEE NOTE

21: CONTINGENCIES IN NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS). THE TAX RATE MAY BE AFFECTED BY THE CLOSING OF ACQUISITIONS OR DIVESTITURES, THE JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH PROFITS ARE DETERMINED TO BE EARNED AND TAXED, AND THE ABILITY TO REALIZE

DEFERRED TAX ASSETS.

AS OF DECEMBER 27, 2003, WE HAVE

APPROXIMATELY $3.7 BILLION OF GOODWILL REMAINING ON OUR BALANCE SHEET, SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF WHICH IS RELATED TO THE ICG OPERATING SEGMENT. IF WE FAIL TO DELIVER NEW PRODUCTS FOR ICG, IF THE PRODUCTS FAIL TO GAIN EXPECTED MARKET ACCEPTANCE, OR IF

MARKET CONDITIONS IN THE COMMUNICATIONS BUSINESS FAIL TO IMPROVE, OUR REVENUE AND COST FORECASTS MAY NOT BE ACHIEVED AND WE MAY INCUR ADDITIONAL CHARGES FOR IMPAIRMENT OF GOODWILL.

AT THE END OF 2003, WE HELD NON-MARKETABLE EQUITY SECURITIES WITH A CARRYING VALUE OF $665 MILLION. IF THE LEVEL OF IPO

MARKET ACTIVITY DOES NOT INCREASE AND THE AVAILABILITY OF VENTURE CAPITAL FUNDING FOR TECHNOLOGY INVESTMENTS DOES NOT IMPROVE, OUR NON-MARKETABLE INVESTMENTS MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED. AS COMPANIES WITHIN OUR PORTFOLIO ATTEMPT TO RAISE ADDITIONAL

FUNDS, THE FUNDS MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE TO THEM, OR THEY MAY RECEIVE LOWER VALUATIONS, WITH LESS FAVORABLE INVESTMENT TERMS THAN IN PREVIOUS FINANCINGS, AND OUR INVESTMENTS WOULD LIKELY BECOME IMPAIRED. HOWEVER, WE ARE NOT ABLE TO DETERMINE AT THE

PRESENT TIME WHICH SPECIFIC INVESTMENTS ARE LIKELY TO BE IMPAIRED IN THE FUTURE, OR THE EXTENT OR TIMING OF INDIVIDUAL IMPAIRMENTS.

WE ARE CURRENTLY A PARTY TO VARIOUS LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND CLAIMS, INCLUDING CLAIMS RELATED TO TAXES. MANAGEMENT DOES NOT BELIEVE THAT THE ULTIMATE OUTCOME

OF THESE LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND CLAIMS WILL HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL POSITION OR OVERALL TRENDS IN RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. HOWEVER, LITIGATION IS SUBJECT TO INHERENT UNCERTAINTIES, AND UNFAVORABLE RULINGS COULD OCCUR. AN

UNFAVORABLE RULING COULD INCLUDE MONETARY DAMAGES, ADDITIONAL TAXES OWED OR, IN CASES WHERE INJUNCTIVE RELIEF IS SOUGHT, AN INJUNCTION PROHIBITING INTEL FROM SELLING ONE OR MORE PRODUCTS. IF AN UNFAVORABLE RULING WERE TO OCCUR IN ANY SPECIFIC

PERIOD, THERE EXISTS THE POSSIBILITY OF A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON THE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OF THAT PERIOD OR FUTURE PERIODS. MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT, GIVEN OUR CURRENT LIQUIDITY AND CASH AND INVESTMENT BALANCES, EVEN AN ADVERSE JUDGMENT WOULD

NOT HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON CASH AND INVESTMENTS OR LIQUIDITY.

WE OPERATE GLOBALLY, WITH SALES OFFICES AND RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES AS WELL AS MANUFACTURING AND ASSEMBLY AND TEST FACILITIES, IN MANY COUNTRIES, AND, AS A RESULT, WE ARE SUBJECT TO RISKS AND FACTORS ASSOCIATED WITH DOING

BUSINESS OUTSIDE THE U.S. GLOBAL OPERATIONS INVOLVE INHERENT RISKS THAT INCLUDE CURRENCY CONTROLS AND FLUCTUATIONS, TARIFF AND IMPORT REGULATIONS, AND REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS THAT MAY LIMIT OUR OR OUR CUSTOMERS ABILITY TO MANUFACTURE, ASSEMBLE

AND TEST, DESIGN, DEVELOP OR SELL PRODUCTS IN PARTICULAR COUNTRIES. IF TERRORIST ACTIVITY, ARMED CONFLICT, CIVIL OR MILITARY UNREST, OR POLITICAL INSTABILITY OCCURS IN THE U.S., ISRAEL OR OTHER LOCATIONS, SUCH EVENTS MAY DISRUPT MANUFACTURING,

ASSEMBLY AND TEST, LOGISTICS, SECURITY AND COMMUNICATIONS, AND COULD ALSO RESULT IN REDUCED DEMAND FOR INTELS PRODUCTS. THE IMPACTS OF MAJOR HEALTH CONCERNS, OR OF LARGE-SCALE OUTAGES OR INTERRUPTIONS OF SERVICE FROM UTILITY OR OTHER

INFRASTRUCTURE PROVIDERS ON INTEL, ITS SUPPLIERS, CUSTOMERS OR OTHER THIRD PARTIES COULD ALSO ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS AND IMPACT CUSTOMER ORDER PATTERNS. WE COULD ALSO BE AFFECTED IF LABOR ISSUES DISRUPT OUR TRANSPORTATION ARRANGEMENTS OR

THOSE OF OUR CUSTOMERS OR SUPPLIERS. ON A WORLDWIDE BASIS, WE REGULARLY REVIEW OUR KEY INFRASTRUCTURE, SYSTEMS, SERVICES AND SUPPLIERS, BOTH INTERNALLY AND EXTERNALLY, TO SEEK TO IDENTIFY SIGNIFICANT VULNERABILITIES AS WELL AS AREAS OF POTENTIAL

BUSINESS IMPACT IF A DISRUPTIVE EVENT WERE TO OCCUR. ONCE WE IDENTIFY A SIGNIFICANT VULNERABILITY, WE ASSESS THE RISKS, AND AS WE CONSIDER IT TO BE APPROPRIATE, WE INITIATE ACTIONS INTENDED TO REDUCE THE RISKS AND THEIR POTENTIAL IMPACT. HOWEVER,

THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT WE HAVE IDENTIFIED ALL SIGNIFICANT RISKS OR THAT WE CAN MITIGATE ALL IDENTIFIED RISKS WITH REASONABLE EFFORT.

OUR FUTURE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND THE OTHER FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS CONTAINED IN THIS FILING, INCLUDING THIS MD&A, INVOLVE A NUMBER OF RISKS AND

UNCERTAINTIESIN PARTICULAR, THE STATEMENTS REGARDING OUR GOALS AND STRATEGIES, NEW PRODUCT INTRODUCTIONS, PLANS TO CULTIVATE NEW BUSINESSES, MARKET SEGMENT SHARE AND GROWTH RATE ASSUMPTIONS, FUTURE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND RECOVERY IN THE

COMMUNICATIONS BUSINESSES, REVENUE, PRICING, GROSS MARGIN AND COSTS, CAPITAL SPENDING, DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION, RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES, POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT OF INVESTMENTS, THE TAX RATE, AND PENDING TAX AND LEGAL PROCEEDINGS. IN

ADDITION TO VARIOUS FACTORS THAT WE HAVE DISCUSSED ABOVE, A NUMBER OF OTHER FACTORS COULD CAUSE ACTUAL RESULTS TO DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM OUR EXPECTATIONS.

(CONTINUED)

DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS, WHICH IMPACTS OUR REVENUE AND GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE, IS AFFECTED BY BUSINESS AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, AS WELL AS COMPUTING AND COMMUNICATIONS INDUSTRY TRENDS AND THE DEVELOPMENT AND TIMING

OF INTRODUCTION OF COMPELLING SOFTWARE APPLICATIONS AND OPERATING SYSTEMS THAT TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE FEATURES OF OUR PRODUCTS. DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS IS ALSO AFFECTED BY CHANGES IN CUSTOMER ORDER PATTERNS, SUCH AS CHANGES IN THE LEVELS OF INVENTORY

MAINTAINED BY OUR CUSTOMERS AND THE TIMING OF CUSTOMER PURCHASES. REVENUE AND GROSS MARGIN COULD ALSO BE AFFECTED BY COMPETITIVE FACTORS, SUCH AS COMPETING CHIP ARCHITECTURES AND MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGIES, COMPETING SOFTWARE-COMPATIBLE

MICROPROCESSORS, PRICING PRESSURES AND OTHER COMPETITIVE FACTORS, AS WELL AS MARKET ACCEPTANCE OF OUR NEW PRODUCTS IN SPECIFIC MARKET SEGMENTS, THE AVAILABILITY OF SUFFICIENT INVENTORY TO MEET DEMAND AND THE AVAILABILITY OF EXTERNALLY PURCHASED

COMPONENTS. OUR FUTURE REVENUE IS ALSO DEPENDENT ON CONTINUING TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCEMENT, INCLUDING DEVELOPING AND IMPLEMENTING NEW PROCESSES AND STRATEGIC PRODUCTS, AS WELL AS THE TIMING OF NEW PRODUCT INTRODUCTIONS, SUSTAINING AND GROWING NEW

BUSINESSES, AND INTEGRATING AND OPERATING ANY ACQUIRED BUSINESSES. OUR RESULTS COULD ALSO BE AFFECTED BY ADVERSE EFFECTS ASSOCIATED WITH PRODUCT DEFECTS AND ERRATA (DEVIATIONS FROM PUBLISHED SPECIFICATIONS) AND BY LITIGATION INVOLVING INTELLECTUAL

PROPERTY, STOCKHOLDER, CONSUMER AND OTHER ISSUES.

WE

BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE THE PRODUCT OFFERINGS, FACILITIES, PERSONNEL, AND COMPETITIVE AND FINANCIAL RESOURCES FOR CONTINUED BUSINESS SUCCESS, BUT FUTURE REVENUE, COSTS, GROSS MARGINS AND PROFITS ARE ALL INFLUENCED BY A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING

THOSE DISCUSSED ABOVE, ALL OF WHICH ARE INHERENTLY DIFFICULT TO FORECAST.

STATUS OF BUSINESS OUTLOOK AND RELATED RISK FACTOR STATEMENTS

WE EXPECT THAT OUR CORPORATE REPRESENTATIVES WILL FROM TIME TO TIME MEET PRIVATELY WITH INVESTORS, INVESTMENT ANALYSTS, THE MEDIA AND OTHERS, AND MAY REITERATE THE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS CONTAINED IN THE

BUSINESS OUTLOOK SECTION AND ELSEWHERE IN THIS FORM 10-K, INCLUDING ANY SUCH STATEMENTS THAT ARE INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE IN THIS FORM 10-K. AT THE SAME TIME, WE WILL KEEP THIS FORM 10-K AND OUR THEN CURRENT BUSINESS OUTLOOK

PUBLICLY AVAILABLE ON OUR INVESTOR RELATIONS WEB SITE (WWW.INTC.COM). THE PUBLIC CAN CONTINUE TO RELY ON THE BUSINESS OUTLOOK PUBLISHED ON THE WEB SITE AS REPRESENTING OUR CURRENT EXPECTATIONS ON MATTERS COVERED, UNLESS WE PUBLISH A NOTICE STATING

OTHERWISE. THE STATEMENTS IN BUSINESS OUTLOOK AND OTHER FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS IN THIS FORM 10-K ARE SUBJECT TO REVISION DURING THE COURSE OF THE YEAR IN OUR QUARTERLY EARNINGS RELEASES AND SEC FILINGS, OUR MID-QUARTER BUSINESS UPDATES AND

AT OTHER TIMES.

WE INTEND TO PUBLISH A MID-QUARTER BUSINESS

UPDATE ON MARCH 4, 2004. FROM THE CLOSE OF BUSINESS ON FEBRUARY 27, 2004 UNTIL PUBLICATION OF THE UPDATE, WE WILL OBSERVE A QUIET PERIOD DURING WHICH THE BUSINESS OUTLOOK AND OTHER FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS FIRST PUBLISHED IN OUR

EARNINGS PRESS RELEASE ON JANUARY 14, 2004, AS REITERATED OR UPDATED, AS APPLICABLE, IN THIS FORM 10-K, SHOULD BE CONSIDERED HISTORICAL, SPEAKING AS OF PRIOR TO THE QUIET PERIOD ONLY AND NOT SUBJECT TO UPDATE. DURING THE QUIET PERIOD, OUR

REPRESENTATIVES WILL NOT COMMENT ON THE BUSINESS OUTLOOK OR OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS OR EXPECTATIONS.

A QUIET PERIOD OPERATING IN SIMILAR FASHION WITH REGARD TO THE BUSINESS OUTLOOK AND OUR FORM 10-K WILL BEGIN AT THE CLOSE OF BUSINESS ON MARCH 12, 2004

AND WILL EXTEND UNTIL THE DAY THAT OUR NEXT QUARTERLY EARNINGS RELEASE IS PUBLISHED, PRESENTLY SCHEDULED FOR APRIL 13, 2004.

ITEM 7A.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

WE ARE EXPOSED TO FINANCIAL MARKET RISKS, INCLUDING CHANGES IN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES, INTEREST RATES AND MARKETABLE EQUITY SECURITY PRICES. TO MITIGATE

THESE RISKS, WE MAY UTILIZE DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, AMONG OTHER STRATEGIES. WE DO NOT USE DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS FOR SPECULATIVE PURPOSES. ALL OF THE POTENTIAL CHANGES NOTED BELOW ARE BASED ON SENSITIVITY ANALYSES PERFORMED ON

OUR FINANCIAL POSITIONS AT DECEMBER 27, 2003. ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER MATERIALLY.

CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES.

WE GENERALLY HEDGE CURRENCY RISKS OF NON-U.S. DOLLAR-DENOMINATED INVESTMENTS IN DEBT SECURITIES WITH OFFSETTING CURRENCY BORROWINGS, CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS OR CURRENCY

INTEREST RATE SWAPS. GAINS AND LOSSES ON THESE NON-U.S.-CURRENCY INVESTMENTS WOULD GENERALLY BE OFFSET BY CORRESPONDING LOSSES AND GAINS ON THE RELATED HEDGING INSTRUMENTS, RESULTING IN NEGLIGIBLE NET EXPOSURE.

A SUBSTANTIAL MAJORITY OF OUR REVENUE, EXPENSE AND CAPITAL PURCHASING

ACTIVITIES ARE TRANSACTED IN U.S. DOLLARS. HOWEVER, WE DO ENTER INTO TRANSACTIONS IN OTHER CURRENCIES, PRIMARILY THE EURO AND CERTAIN OTHER EUROPEAN AND ASIAN CURRENCIES. TO PROTECT AGAINST REDUCTIONS IN VALUE AND THE VOLATILITY OF FUTURE CASH FLOWS

CAUSED BY CHANGES IN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES, WE HAVE ESTABLISHED BALANCE SHEET AND FORECASTED TRANSACTION HEDGING PROGRAMS. CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS ARE UTILIZED IN THESE HEDGING PROGRAMS. OUR HEDGING PROGRAMS REDUCE, BUT DO NOT ALWAYS ENTIRELY

ELIMINATE, THE IMPACT OF CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE MOVEMENTS. WE CONSIDERED THE HISTORICAL TRENDS IN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES AND DETERMINED THAT IT WAS REASONABLY POSSIBLE THAT ADVERSE CHANGES IN EXCHANGE RATES OF 20% FOR ALL CURRENCIES COULD BE

EXPERIENCED IN THE NEAR TERM. SUCH ADVERSE CHANGES, AFTER TAKING INTO ACCOUNT HEDGES AND OFFSETTING POSITIONS, WOULD HAVE RESULTED IN AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON INCOME BEFORE TAXES OF LESS THAN $10 MILLION AS OF THE END OF EACH OF 2003 AND 2002.

INTEREST RATES.

THE PRIMARY OBJECTIVE OF OUR

INVESTMENTS IN DEBT SECURITIES IS TO PRESERVE PRINCIPAL WHILE MAXIMIZING YIELDS, WITHOUT SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASING RISK. TO ACHIEVE THIS OBJECTIVE, THE RETURNS ON A SUBSTANTIAL MAJORITY OF OUR MARKETABLE INVESTMENTS IN LONG-TERM FIXED RATE DEBT

SECURITIES ARE SWAPPED TO U.S. DOLLAR LIBOR-BASED RETURNS. WE CONSIDERED THE HISTORICAL VOLATILITY OF THE THREE-MONTH LIBOR RATE EXPERIENCED IN PRIOR YEARS AND DETERMINED THAT IT WAS REASONABLY POSSIBLE THAT AN ADVERSE CHANGE OF 80 BASIS POINTS,

APPROXIMATELY 68% OF THE RATE AT THE END OF 2003, COULD BE EXPERIENCED IN THE NEAR TERM. A HYPOTHETICAL 0.80% (80-BASIS-POINT) INCREASE IN INTEREST RATES, AFTER TAKING INTO ACCOUNT HEDGES AND OFFSETTING POSITIONS, WOULD HAVE RESULTED IN A DECREASE

IN THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR INVESTMENT SECURITIES OF APPROXIMATELY $10 MILLION OR LESS AS OF THE END OF EACH OF 2003 AND 2002.

MARKETABLE EQUITY SECURITY PRICES.

WE HAVE A PORTFOLIO OF EQUITY INVESTMENTS THAT INCLUDES MARKETABLE STRATEGIC EQUITY SECURITIES,

TRADING ASSETS AND DERIVATIVE EQUITY INSTRUMENTS SUCH AS WARRANTS AND OPTIONS, AS WELL AS NON-MARKETABLE EQUITY INVESTMENTS. WE INVEST IN COMPANIES THAT DEVELOP SOFTWARE, HARDWARE AND OTHER TECHNOLOGIES OR PROVIDE SERVICES SUPPORTING TECHNOLOGIES.

THIS STRATEGIC INVESTMENT PROGRAM HELPS ADVANCE OUR OVERALL MISSION TO BE THE PREEMINENT SUPPLIER OF BUILDING BLOCKS TO THE WORLDWIDE INTERNET ECONOMY. OUR CURRENT INVESTMENT FOCUS AREAS INCLUDE: ENABLING MOBILE AND INTERNET CLIENT DEVICES, HELPING

TO CREATE THE DIGITAL HOME, ADVANCING HIGH-PERFORMANCE COMMUNICATIONS INFRASTRUCTURE AND DEVELOPING THE NEXT GENERATION OF SILICON PRODUCTION TECHNOLOGIES. OUR FOCUS AREAS TEND TO DEVELOP AND CHANGE OVER TIME DUE TO RAPID ADVANCEMENTS IN THE

TECHNOLOGY FIELD.

TO THE EXTENT THAT OUR MARKETABLE PORTFOLIO

OF INVESTMENTS CONTINUES TO HAVE STRATEGIC VALUE, WE TYPICALLY DO NOT ATTEMPT TO REDUCE OR ELIMINATE OUR MARKET EXPOSURE. FOR THOSE SECURITIES THAT WE NO LONGER CONSIDER STRATEGIC, WE EVALUATE MARKET AND ECONOMIC FACTORS IN OUR DECISION ON THE

TIMING OF DISPOSAL AND WHETHER IT IS POSSIBLE AND APPROPRIATE TO HEDGE THE EQUITY MARKET RISK. AS OF DECEMBER 27, 2003, THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR PORTFOLIO OF MARKETABLE EQUITY INVESTMENTS AND EQUITY DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS, INCLUDING HEDGING POSITIONS,

WAS $591 MILLION.

TO ASSESS THE MARKET PRICE SENSITIVITY OF

OUR MARKETABLE PORTFOLIO, WE ANALYZED THE HISTORICAL MOVEMENTS OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS OF HIGH-TECHNOLOGY STOCK INDICES THAT WE CONSIDERED APPROPRIATE. BASED ON THE ANALYSIS OF THESE INDICES, WE ESTIMATED THAT IT WAS REASONABLY POSSIBLE THAT THE

PRICES OF THE STOCKS IN OUR PORTFOLIO COULD EXPERIENCE A 30% ADVERSE CHANGE IN THE NEAR TERM. HOWEVER, OUR MARKETABLE PORTFOLIO IS SUBSTANTIALLY CONCENTRATED IN ONE COMPANY, WHICH WILL AFFECT THE MARKETABLE PORTFOLIOS PRICE VOLATILITY. WE

CURRENTLY HAVE AN INVESTMENT IN MICRON TECHNOLOGY, INC. OF APPROXIMATELY $458 MILLION, OR 77% OF THE TOTAL MARKETABLE VALUE INCLUDING EQUITY DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS. THE INVESTMENT IN MICRON IS PART OF OUR STRATEGY TO SUPPORT THE DEVELOPMENT AND

SUPPLY OF DYNAMIC RANDOM ACCESS MEMORY (DRAM) PRODUCTS. WE ANALYZED THE HISTORICAL VOLATILITY OF MICRONS STOCK, AND IF THE STOCK BEHAVES WITH THE SAME PRICE VOLATILITY THAT IT HAS IN THE PAST, WE COULD EXPERIENCE A 60% LOSS. IF WE APPLY A 60%

HYPOTHETICAL CHANGE TO THE ENTIRE PORTFOLIO, THE HYPOTHETICAL LOSS WOULD BE SIGNIFICANTLY LARGER THAN THE LOSS ASSUMING A 30% DECLINE.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

INDEX TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

THE TABLE BELOW PRESENTS THE FAIR VALUE AND HYPOTHETICAL LOSS FOR OUR MARKETABLE PORTFOLIO GIVEN THE

SPECIFIED PERCENTAGE DECREASES IN EQUITY PRICES. THE ESTIMATED DECREASES REFLECT THE IMPACT OF HEDGES AND OFFSETTING POSITIONS, AND ARE NOT NECESSARILY INDICATIVE OF FUTURE PERFORMANCE. ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER MATERIALLY.

A 60% LOSS WAS NOT CALCULATED AS OF DECEMBER 28, 2002, AS WE DID NOT HAVE A SIMILARLY CONCENTRATED INVESTMENT.

NON-MARKETABLE EQUITY

SECURITIES.

OUR STRATEGIC INVESTMENTS IN NON-MARKETABLE EQUITY SECURITIES WOULD ALSO BE AFFECTED BY AN ADVERSE MOVEMENT OF EQUITY MARKET PRICES, ALTHOUGH THE IMPACT CANNOT BE DIRECTLY QUANTIFIED. SUCH A MOVEMENT AND THE RELATED

UNDERLYING ECONOMIC CONDITIONS WOULD NEGATIVELY AFFECT THE PROSPECTS OF THE COMPANIES WE INVEST IN, THEIR ABILITY TO RAISE ADDITIONAL CAPITAL AND THE LIKELIHOOD OF OUR BEING ABLE TO REALIZE OUR INVESTMENTS THROUGH LIQUIDITY EVENTS SUCH AS INITIAL

PUBLIC OFFERINGS, MERGERS AND PRIVATE SALES. THESE TYPES OF INVESTMENTS INVOLVE A GREAT DEAL OF RISK, AND THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT ANY SPECIFIC COMPANY WILL GROW OR WILL BECOME SUCCESSFUL; CONSEQUENTLY, WE COULD LOSE ALL OR PART OF OUR

INVESTMENT. AT DECEMBER 27, 2003, OUR STRATEGIC INVESTMENTS IN NON-MARKETABLE EQUITY SECURITIES HAD A CARRYING AMOUNT OF $665 MILLION, EXCLUDING EQUITY DERIVATIVES THAT WERE SUBJECT TO MARK-TO-MARKET REQUIREMENTS.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE

1:  BASIS OF PRESENTATION

INTEL CORPORATION HAS

A FISCAL YEAR THAT ENDS ON THE LAST SATURDAY IN DECEMBER. FISCAL YEAR 2003, A 52-WEEK YEAR, ENDED ON DECEMBER 27, 2003. FISCAL YEAR 2002 WAS A 52-WEEK YEAR THAT ENDED ON DECEMBER 28, AND FISCAL YEAR 2001, ALSO A 52-WEEK YEAR, ENDED ON DECEMBER 29.

THE NEXT 53-WEEK YEAR WILL END ON DECEMBER 31, 2005.

THE

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDE THE ACCOUNTS OF INTEL AND ITS WHOLLY OWNED SUBSIDIARIES. INTERCOMPANY ACCOUNTS AND TRANSACTIONS HAVE BEEN ELIMINATED. PARTIALLY OWNED, NON-CONTROLLED EQUITY AFFILIATES ARE ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER THE EQUITY

METHOD. ACCOUNTS DENOMINATED IN NON-U.S. CURRENCIES HAVE BEEN REMEASURED USING THE U.S. DOLLAR AS THE FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY. CERTAIN AMOUNTS REPORTED IN PREVIOUS YEARS HAVE BEEN RECLASSIFIED TO CONFORM TO THE 2003 PRESENTATION.

NOTE 2:  ACCOUNTING POLICIES

USE OF ESTIMATES

THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN CONFORMITY WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE U.S. REQUIRES

MANAGEMENT TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS THAT AFFECT THE AMOUNTS REPORTED IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND ACCOMPANYING NOTES. THE ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES THAT REQUIRE MANAGEMENTS MOST DIFFICULT AND SUBJECTIVE JUDGMENTS INCLUDE THE ASSESSMENT OF

RECOVERABILITY OF PROPERTY, PLANT, AND EQUIPMENT AND GOODWILL; THE VALUATION OF NON-MARKETABLE EQUITY SECURITIES AND INVENTORY; AND THE RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT OF INCOME TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. THE ACTUAL RESULTS EXPERIENCED BY THE COMPANY

MAY DIFFER FROM MANAGEMENTS ESTIMATES.

CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS

HIGHLY LIQUID DEBT SECURITIES WITH INSIGNIFICANT

INTEREST RATE RISK AND WITH ORIGINAL MATURITIES FROM THE DATE OF PURCHASE OF THREE MONTHS OR LESS ARE CLASSIFIED AS CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS.

INVESTMENTS

TRADING ASSETS.

TRADING ASSETS ARE STATED AT FAIR VALUE, WITH GAINS OR LOSSES RESULTING FROM CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE RECOGNIZED CURRENTLY

IN EARNINGS. THE COMPANY ELECTS TO CLASSIFY AS TRADING ASSETS A PORTION OF ITS MARKETABLE DEBT SECURITIES. FOR THESE DEBT SECURITIES, GAINS OR LOSSES FROM CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE DUE TO INTEREST RATE AND CURRENCY MARKET FLUCTUATIONS, OFFSET BY LOSSES

OR GAINS ON RELATED DERIVATIVES, ARE INCLUDED IN INTEREST AND OTHER, NET. A PORTION OF THE COMPANYS MARKETABLE EQUITY SECURITIES MAY FROM TIME TO TIME BE CLASSIFIED AS TRADING ASSETS, IF THE COMPANY NO LONGER DEEMS THE INVESTMENTS TO BE

STRATEGIC IN NATURE AT THE TIME OF TRADING ASSET DESIGNATION, AND HAS THE ABILITY AND INTENT TO MITIGATE EQUITY MARKET RISK THROUGH SALE OR THE USE OF DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS. FOR THESE MARKETABLE EQUITY SECURITIES, GAINS OR LOSSES FROM CHANGES IN

FAIR VALUE, PRIMARILY OFFSET BY LOSSES OR GAINS ON RELATED DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS, ARE INCLUDED IN GAINS (LOSSES) ON EQUITY SECURITIES, NET. ALSO INCLUDED IN TRADING ASSETS IS A MARKETABLE EQUITY PORTFOLIO HELD TO GENERATE RETURNS THAT SEEK TO

OFFSET CHANGES IN LIABILITIES RELATED TO THE EQUITY MARKET RISK OF CERTAIN DEFERRED COMPENSATION ARRANGEMENTS. GAINS OR LOSSES FROM CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE OF THESE EQUITY SECURITIES, OFFSET BY LOSSES OR GAINS ON THE RELATED LIABILITIES, ARE INCLUDED

IN INTEREST AND OTHER, NET. THE COMPANY ALSO USES FIXED INCOME INVESTMENTS AND DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS TO SEEK TO OFFSET THE REMAINING PORTION OF THE CHANGES IN THE COMPENSATION LIABILITIES.

AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE INVESTMENTS.

INVESTMENTS DESIGNATED AS

AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE INCLUDE MARKETABLE DEBT AND EQUITY SECURITIES. INVESTMENTS THAT ARE DESIGNATED AS AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE AS OF THE BALANCE SHEET DATE ARE REPORTED AT FAIR VALUE, WITH UNREALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES, NET OF TAX, RECORDED IN

STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY. THE COST OF SECURITIES SOLD IS BASED ON THE SPECIFIC IDENTIFICATION METHOD. REALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES ON THE SALE OF DEBT SECURITIES ARE RECORDED IN INTEREST AND OTHER, NET. REALIZED GAINS OR LOSSES ON THE SALE OR EXCHANGE

OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND DECLINES IN VALUE JUDGED TO BE OTHER THAN TEMPORARY ARE RECORDED IN GAINS (LOSSES) ON EQUITY SECURITIES, NET. MARKETABLE EQUITY SECURITIES ARE PRESUMED TO BE IMPAIRED IF THE FAIR VALUE IS LESS THAN THE COST BASIS

CONTINUOUSLY FOR SIX MONTHS, ABSENT COMPELLING EVIDENCE TO THE CONTRARY.

DEBT SECURITIES WITH ORIGINAL MATURITIES GREATER THAN THREE MONTHS AND REMAINING MATURITIES LESS THAN ONE YEAR ARE CLASSIFIED AS SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS. DEBT SECURITIES WITH REMAINING MATURITIES GREATER THAN ONE YEAR

ARE CLASSIFIED AS LONG-TERM INVESTMENTS.

THE COMPANY ACQUIRES

CERTAIN EQUITY INVESTMENTS FOR THE PROMOTION OF BUSINESS AND STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES, AND TO THE EXTENT THAT THESE INVESTMENTS CONTINUE TO HAVE STRATEGIC VALUE, THE COMPANY TYPICALLY DOES NOT ATTEMPT TO REDUCE OR ELIMINATE THE INHERENT MARKET RISKS

THROUGH HEDGING ACTIVITIES. THE MARKETABLE PORTION OF THESE INVESTMENTS IS INCLUDED IN MARKETABLE STRATEGIC EQUITY SECURITIES.

NON-MARKETABLE EQUITY SECURITIES AND OTHER INVESTMENTS.

NON-MARKETABLE EQUITY

SECURITIES AND OTHER INVESTMENTS ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AT HISTORICAL COST OR, IF INTEL HAS SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE OVER THE INVESTEE, USING THE EQUITY METHOD OF ACCOUNTING. INTELS PROPORTIONATE SHARE OF INCOME OR LOSSES FROM INVESTMENTS ACCOUNTED

FOR UNDER THE EQUITY METHOD, AND ANY GAIN OR LOSS ON DISPOSAL, ARE RECORDED IN INTEREST AND OTHER, NET. NON-MARKETABLE EQUITY SECURITIES, EQUITY-METHOD INVESTMENTS AND OTHER INVESTMENTS ARE INCLUDED IN OTHER ASSETS. ALL OF THE COMPANYS

INVESTMENTS ARE SUBJECT TO A PERIODIC IMPAIRMENT REVIEW; HOWEVER, FOR NON-MARKETABLE EQUITY SECURITIES, THE IMPAIRMENT ANALYSIS REQUIRES SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT TO IDENTIFY EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES THAT WOULD LIKELY HAVE A SIGNIFICANT ADVERSE EFFECT ON

THE FAIR VALUE OF THE INVESTMENT. THE INDICATORS INTEL USES TO IDENTIFY THOSE EVENTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES INCLUDE THE INVESTEES REVENUE AND EARNINGS TRENDS RELATIVE TO PREDEFINED MILESTONES AND OVERALL BUSINESS PROSPECTS; THE TECHNOLOGICAL

FEASIBILITY OF THE INVESTEES PRODUCTS AND TECHNOLOGIES; THE GENERAL MARKET CONDITIONS IN THE INVESTEES INDUSTRY; AND THE INVESTEES LIQUIDITY, DEBT RATIOS AND THE RATE AT WHICH THE INVESTEE IS USING CASH. INVESTMENTS IDENTIFIED AS

HAVING AN INDICATOR OF IMPAIRMENT ARE SUBJECT TO FURTHER ANALYSIS TO DETERMINE IF THE INVESTMENT IS OTHER THAN TEMPORARILY IMPAIRED, IN WHICH CASE THE INVESTMENT IS WRITTEN DOWN TO ITS IMPAIRED VALUE. WHEN AN INVESTEE IS NOT CONSIDERED VIABLE FROM A

FINANCIAL OR TECHNOLOGICAL POINT OF VIEW, THE ENTIRE INVESTMENT IS WRITTEN DOWN, SINCE THE ESTIMATED FAIR MARKET VALUE IS CONSIDERED TO BE NOMINAL. IF AN INVESTEE OBTAINS ADDITIONAL FUNDING AT A VALUATION LOWER THAN INTELS CARRYING AMOUNT OR

REQUIRES A NEW ROUND OF EQUITY FUNDING TO STAY IN OPERATION, AND THE NEW FUNDING DOES NOT APPEAR IMMINENT, IT IS PRESUMED THAT THE INVESTMENT IS OTHER THAN TEMPORARILY IMPAIRED, UNLESS SPECIFIC FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE OTHERWISE. IMPAIRMENT

OF NON-MARKETABLE EQUITY SECURITIES IS RECORDED IN GAINS (LOSSES) ON EQUITY SECURITIES, NET.

SECURITIES LENDING

FROM TIME TO TIME, THE COMPANY ENTERS INTO SECURITIES LENDING AGREEMENTS WITH FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, GENERALLY TO FACILITATE HEDGING TRANSACTIONS. SELECTED SECURITIES ARE LOANED AND ARE SECURED BY COLLATERAL IN THE FORM OF CASH OR

SECURITIES. THE LOANED SECURITIES CONTINUE TO BE CARRIED AS INVESTMENT ASSETS ON THE BALANCE SHEET. CASH COLLATERAL IS RECORDED AS AN ASSET WITH A CORRESPONDING LIABILITY. FOR LENDING AGREEMENTS COLLATERALIZED BY SECURITIES, THE COLLATERAL IS NOT

RECORDED AS AN ASSET OR A LIABILITY, UNLESS THE COLLATERAL IS REPLEDGED. SEE NOTE 5: BORROWINGS.

FAIR VALUES OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

FAIR VALUES OF CASH EQUIVALENTS APPROXIMATE COST DUE TO THE SHORT PERIOD OF TIME TO MATURITY. FAIR VALUES OF SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS, TRADING ASSETS, LONG-TERM INVESTMENTS, MARKETABLE STRATEGIC EQUITY SECURITIES,

CERTAIN NON-MARKETABLE INVESTMENTS, SHORT-TERM DEBT, LONG-TERM DEBT, SWAPS, CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS, EQUITY OPTIONS AND WARRANTS ARE BASED ON QUOTED MARKET PRICES OR PRICING MODELS USING CURRENT MARKET RATES. DEBT SECURITIES ARE GENERALLY VALUED

USING DISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS IN A YIELD-CURVE MODEL BASED ON LIBOR. EQUITY OPTIONS AND WARRANTS ARE PRICED USING A BLACK-SCHOLES OPTION PRICING MODEL. FOR THE COMPANYS PORTFOLIO OF NON-MARKETABLE EQUITY SECURITIES, MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT THE

CARRYING VALUE OF THE PORTFOLIO APPROXIMATES THE FAIR VALUE AT DECEMBER 27, 2003 AND DECEMBER 28, 2002. THIS ESTIMATE TAKES INTO ACCOUNT THE DECLINE OF THE EQUITY AND VENTURE CAPITAL MARKETS OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS, THE IMPAIRMENT ANALYSES PERFORMED

AND THE IMPAIRMENTS RECORDED DURING 2003 AND 2002. ALL OF THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUES ARE MANAGEMENTS ESTIMATES; HOWEVER, WHEN THERE IS NO READILY AVAILABLE MARKET, THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUES MAY NOT NECESSARILY REPRESENT THE AMOUNTS THAT COULD

BE REALIZED IN A CURRENT TRANSACTION, AND THESE FAIR VALUES COULD CHANGE SIGNIFICANTLY.

DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

THE

COMPANYS PRIMARY OBJECTIVE FOR HOLDING DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS IS TO MANAGE CURRENCY, INTEREST RATE AND SOME EQUITY MARKET RISKS. THE COMPANYS DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS ARE RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE AND ARE INCLUDED IN OTHER CURRENT

ASSETS, OTHER ASSETS, OTHER ACCRUED LIABILITIES OR DEBT. THE COMPANYS ACCOUNTING POLICIES FOR THESE INSTRUMENTS ARE BASED ON WHETHER THEY MEET THE COMPANYS CRITERIA FOR DESIGNATION AS HEDGING TRANSACTIONS, EITHER AS CASH FLOW OR FAIR

VALUE HEDGES. A HEDGE OF THE EXPOSURE TO VARIABILITY IN THE CASH FLOWS OF AN ASSET OR A LIABILITY, OR OF A FORECASTED TRANSACTION, IS REFERRED TO AS A CASH FLOW HEDGE. A HEDGE OF THE EXPOSURE TO CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE OF AN ASSET OR A LIABILITY, OR

OF AN UNRECOGNIZED FIRM COMMITMENT, IS REFERRED TO AS A FAIR VALUE HEDGE. THE CRITERIA FOR DESIGNATING A DERIVATIVE AS A HEDGE INCLUDE THE INSTRUMENTS EFFECTIVENESS IN RISK REDUCTION AND, IN MOST CASES, A ONE-TO-ONE MATCHING OF THE DERIVATIVE

INSTRUMENT TO ITS UNDERLYING TRANSACTION. GAINS AND LOSSES FROM CHANGES IN FAIR VALUES OF DERIVATIVES THAT ARE NOT DESIGNATED AS HEDGES FOR ACCOUNTING PURPOSES ARE RECOGNIZED CURRENTLY IN EARNINGS, AND GENERALLY OFFSET CHANGES IN THE VALUES OF

RELATED ASSETS, LIABILITIES OR DEBT.

AS PART OF ITS STRATEGIC

INVESTMENT PROGRAM, THE COMPANY ALSO ACQUIRES EQUITY DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS, SUCH AS WARRANTS AND EQUITY CONVERSION RIGHTS ASSOCIATED WITH DEBT INSTRUMENTS, THAT ARE NOT DESIGNATED AS HEDGING INSTRUMENTS. THE GAINS OR LOSSES FROM CHANGES IN FAIR

VALUES OF THESE EQUITY DERIVATIVES ARE RECOGNIZED IN GAINS (LOSSES) ON EQUITY SECURITIES, NET.

CURRENCY RISK.

THE COMPANY TRANSACTS BUSINESS IN VARIOUS CURRENCIES OTHER THAN THE

U.S. DOLLAR, PRIMARILY THE EURO AND CERTAIN OTHER EUROPEAN AND ASIAN CURRENCIES. THE COMPANY HAS ESTABLISHED BALANCE SHEET AND FORECASTED TRANSACTION RISK MANAGEMENT PROGRAMS TO PROTECT AGAINST REDUCTIONS IN FAIR VALUE AND VOLATILITY OF FUTURE CASH

FLOWS CAUSED BY CHANGES IN EXCHANGE RATES. THE FORECASTED TRANSACTION RISK MANAGEMENT PROGRAM INCLUDES ANTICIPATED TRANSACTIONS SUCH AS OPERATING COSTS AND EXPENSES AND CAPITAL PURCHASES. THE COMPANY MAY USE CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS, CURRENCY

OPTIONS, CURRENCY INTEREST RATE SWAPS AND CURRENCY BORROWINGS IN THESE RISK MANAGEMENT PROGRAMS. THESE PROGRAMS REDUCE, BUT DO NOT ALWAYS ENTIRELY ELIMINATE, THE IMPACT OF CURRENCY EXCHANGE MOVEMENTS.

CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS AND CURRENCY OPTIONS THAT ARE USED TO HEDGE

EXPOSURES TO VARIABILITY IN ANTICIPATED NON-U.S.-DOLLAR-DENOMINATED CASH FLOWS ARE DESIGNATED AS CASH FLOW HEDGES. THE MATURITIES OF THESE INSTRUMENTS ARE GENERALLY LESS THAN 24 MONTHS. FOR THESE DERIVATIVES, THE GAIN OR LOSS FROM THE EFFECTIVE

PORTION OF THE HEDGE IS REPORTED AS A COMPONENT OF OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME IN STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY AND IS RECLASSIFIED INTO EARNINGS IN THE SAME PERIOD OR PERIODS IN WHICH THE HEDGED TRANSACTION AFFECTS EARNINGS, AND WITHIN THE SAME INCOME

STATEMENT LINE ITEM AS THE IMPACT OF THE HEDGED TRANSACTION. THE GAIN OR LOSS FROM THE INEFFECTIVE PORTION OF THE HEDGE IN EXCESS OF THE CUMULATIVE CHANGE IN THE PRESENT VALUE OF FUTURE CASH FLOWS OF THE HEDGED ITEM, IF ANY, IS RECOGNIZED IN

INTEREST AND OTHER, NET DURING THE PERIOD OF CHANGE.

CURRENCY

INTEREST RATE SWAPS AND CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS ARE USED TO OFFSET THE CURRENCY RISK OF NON-U.S.-DOLLAR-DENOMINATED DEBT SECURITIES CLASSIFIED AS TRADING ASSETS, AS WELL AS OTHER ASSETS AND LIABILITIES DENOMINATED IN VARIOUS CURRENCIES. THE

MATURITIES OF THESE INSTRUMENTS ARE GENERALLY LESS THAN 12 MONTHS, EXCEPT FOR DERIVATIVES HEDGING EQUITY INVESTMENTS, WHICH ARE GENERALLY FIVE YEARS OR LESS. CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE OF THE UNDERLYING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE GENERALLY OFFSET BY THE

CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE OF THE RELATED DERIVATIVES, WITH THE RESULTING NET GAIN OR LOSS, IF ANY, RECORDED IN INTEREST AND OTHER, NET.

INTEREST RATE RISK.

THE COMPANYS PRIMARY OBJECTIVE FOR HOLDING INVESTMENTS IN DEBT SECURITIES IS TO PRESERVE PRINCIPAL WHILE

MAXIMIZING YIELDS, WITHOUT SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASING RISK. TO ACHIEVE THIS OBJECTIVE, THE RETURNS ON A SUBSTANTIAL MAJORITY OF THE COMPANYS INVESTMENTS IN LONG-TERM FIXED-RATE MARKETABLE DEBT SECURITIES ARE SWAPPED TO U.S. DOLLAR LIBOR-BASED

RETURNS, USING INTEREST RATE SWAPS AND CURRENCY INTEREST RATE SWAPS IN TRANSACTIONS THAT ARE NOT DESIGNATED AS HEDGES FOR ACCOUNTING PURPOSES. THE FLOATING INTEREST RATES ON THE SWAPS ARE RESET ON A MONTHLY, QUARTERLY OR SEMIANNUAL BASIS. CHANGES IN

FAIR VALUE OF THE DEBT SECURITIES CLASSIFIED AS TRADING ASSETS ARE GENERALLY OFFSET BY CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE OF THE RELATED DERIVATIVES, RESULTING IN NEGLIGIBLE NET IMPACT. THE NET GAIN OR LOSS, IF ANY, IS RECORDED IN INTEREST AND OTHER, NET.

THE COMPANY MAY ALSO ENTER INTO INTEREST RATE SWAP AGREEMENTS

TO MODIFY THE INTEREST CHARACTERISTICS OF A PORTION OF ITS OUTSTANDING LONG-TERM DEBT. THESE TRANSACTIONS ARE DESIGNATED AS FAIR VALUE HEDGES. THE GAINS OR LOSSES FROM THE CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE OF THE INTEREST RATE SWAPS, AS WELL AS THE OFFSETTING

CHANGE IN THE HEDGED FAIR VALUE OF THE LONG-TERM DEBT, ARE RECOGNIZED IN INTEREST EXPENSE.

EQUITY MARKET RISK.

THE COMPANY MAY ENTER INTO TRANSACTIONS DESIGNATED AS FAIR VALUE HEDGES USING EQUITY OPTIONS, SWAPS OR FORWARD CONTRACTS TO HEDGE THE EQUITY MARKET RISK OF MARKETABLE SECURITIES

IN ITS PORTFOLIO OF STRATEGIC EQUITY INVESTMENTS ONCE THE SECURITIES ARE NO LONGER CONSIDERED TO HAVE STRATEGIC VALUE. THE GAIN OR LOSS FROM THE CHANGE IN FAIR VALUE OF THESE EQUITY DERIVATIVES, AS WELL AS THE OFFSETTING CHANGE IN HEDGED FAIR VALUE

OF THE UNDERLYING EQUITY SECURITIES, ARE RECOGNIZED CURRENTLY IN GAINS (LOSSES) ON EQUITY SECURITIES, NET. THE COMPANY MAY USE EQUITY DERIVATIVES IN TRANSACTIONS NOT DESIGNATED AS HEDGES TO OFFSET THE CHANGE IN FAIR VALUE OF CERTAIN EQUITY

SECURITIES CLASSIFIED AS TRADING ASSETS. THE COMPANY MAY OR MAY NOT ENTER INTO TRANSACTIONS TO REDUCE OR ELIMINATE THE MARKET RISKS OF ITS INVESTMENTS IN STRATEGIC EQUITY DERIVATIVES, INCLUDING WARRANTS.

MEASUREMENT OF EFFECTIVENESS OF HEDGE RELATIONSHIPS.

FOR

CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS, EFFECTIVENESS OF THE HEDGE IS MEASURED USING SPOT RATES FOR HEDGING STRATEGIES RELATED TO LONG-TERM CAPITAL PURCHASES, AND USING FORWARD RATES FOR ALL OTHER STRATEGIES, TO VALUE THE FORWARD CONTRACT AND THE UNDERLYING

HEDGED TRANSACTION. FOR CURRENCY OPTIONS AND EQUITY OPTIONS, EFFECTIVENESS IS MEASURED BY THE CHANGE IN THE OPTIONS INTRINSIC VALUE, WHICH REPRESENTS THE CHANGE FROM THE SPOT PRICE OF THE UNDERLYING HEDGED TRANSACTION COMPARED TO THE

OPTIONS STRIKE PRICE. CHANGES IN TIME VALUE OF THESE OPTIONS ARE NOT INCLUDED IN THE ASSESSMENT OF EFFECTIVENESS. FOR INTEREST RATE SWAPS, EFFECTIVENESS IS MEASURED BY OFFSETTING THE CHANGE IN FAIR VALUE OF THE LONG-TERM DEBT WITH THE CHANGE

IN FAIR VALUE OF THE INTEREST RATE SWAP.

ANY INEFFECTIVE

PORTION OF THE HEDGES, AS WELL AS AMOUNTS NOT INCLUDED IN THE ASSESSMENT OF EFFECTIVENESS, ARE RECOGNIZED CURRENTLY IN INTEREST AND OTHER, NET OR IN GAINS (LOSSES) ON EQUITY SECURITIES, NET, DEPENDING ON THE NATURE OF THE UNDERLYING ASSET OR

LIABILITY. IF A

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

CASH FLOW HEDGE WERE TO BE DISCONTINUED BECAUSE IT IS PROBABLE THAT THE ORIGINAL HEDGED TRANSACTION WILL NOT OCCUR AS ANTICIPATED, THE UNREALIZED GAINS OR

LOSSES ON THE RELATED DERIVATIVE WOULD BE RECLASSIFIED INTO EARNINGS. SUBSEQUENT GAINS OR LOSSES ON THE RELATED DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENT WOULD BE RECOGNIZED IN INCOME IN EACH PERIOD UNTIL THE INSTRUMENT MATURES, IS TERMINATED OR IS SOLD.

FOR ALL PERIODS PRESENTED, THE PORTION OF HEDGING INSTRUMENTS GAINS OR

LOSSES EXCLUDED FROM THE ASSESSMENT OF EFFECTIVENESS AND THE INEFFECTIVE PORTIONS OF HEDGES HAD AN INSIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON EARNINGS FOR BOTH CASH FLOW AND FAIR VALUE HEDGES. THERE WAS NO SIGNIFICANT IMPACT TO RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FROM DISCONTINUED

CASH FLOW HEDGES AS A RESULT OF FORECASTED TRANSACTIONS THAT DID NOT OCCUR. FOR ALL PERIODS PRESENTED, INSIGNIFICANT AMOUNTS OF DEFERRED GAINS OR LOSSES WERE RECLASSIFIED FROM ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME TO DEPRECIATION EXPENSE RELATED TO

THE COMPANYS FOREIGN CURRENCY CAPITAL PURCHASE HEDGING PROGRAM. THE COMPANY ESTIMATES THAT LESS THAN $10 MILLION OF NET DERIVATIVE GAINS INCLUDED IN OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME WILL BE RECLASSIFIED INTO EARNINGS WITHIN THE NEXT 12 MONTHS.

INVENTORIES

INVENTORY COST IS COMPUTED ON A CURRENTLY ADJUSTED STANDARD BASIS (WHICH

APPROXIMATES ACTUAL COST ON AN AVERAGE OR FIRST-IN, FIRST-OUT BASIS). WORK IN PROCESS AND FINISHED GOODS INVENTORY ARE DETERMINED TO BE SALEABLE BASED ON A DEMAND FORECAST WITHIN A SPECIFIC TIME HORIZON, GENERALLY SIX MONTHS OR LESS. INVENTORY IN

EXCESS OF SALEABLE AMOUNTS IS NOT VALUED, AND THE REMAINING INVENTORY IS VALUED AT THE LOWER OF COST OR MARKET. INVENTORIES AT FISCAL YEAR-ENDS WERE AS FOLLOWS.

ARE REGULARLY PERFORMED TO DETERMINE WHETHER FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES EXIST WHICH INDICATE THAT THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF ASSETS MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE OR THAT THE USEFUL LIFE IS SHORTER THAN ORIGINALLY ESTIMATED. THE COMPANY ASSESSES THE RECOVERABILITY

OF ITS ASSETS BY COMPARING THE PROJECTED UNDISCOUNTED NET CASH FLOWS ASSOCIATED WITH THE RELATED ASSET OR GROUP OF ASSETS OVER THEIR REMAINING LIVES AGAINST THEIR RESPECTIVE CARRYING AMOUNTS. IMPAIRMENT, IF ANY, IS BASED ON THE EXCESS OF THE

CARRYING AMOUNT OVER THE FAIR VALUE OF THOSE ASSETS (SEE NOTE 19: IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS). IF ASSETS ARE DETERMINED TO BE RECOVERABLE, BUT THE USEFUL LIVES ARE SHORTER THAN ORIGINALLY ESTIMATED, THE NET BOOK VALUE OF THE ASSETS

IS DEPRECIATED OVER THE NEWLY DETERMINED REMAINING USEFUL LIVES.

GOODWILL

EFFECTIVE THE BEGINNING OF

2002, THE COMPANY DISCONTINUED AMORTIZING THE REMAINING GOODWILL BALANCES UNDER THE PROVISIONS OF STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS (SFAS) NO. 142, GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS. ALL REMAINING AND FUTURE ACQUIRED

GOODWILL IS SUBJECT TO AN IMPAIRMENT TEST IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF EACH YEAR, OR EARLIER IF INDICATORS OF POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT EXIST, USING A FAIR-VALUE-BASED APPROACH. SEE NOTE 16: GOODWILL FOR A DISCUSSION OF GOODWILL IMPAIRMENTS.

UPON ADOPTION OF SFAS NO. 141, BUSINESS COMBINATIONS, WORKFORCE-IN-PLACE NO LONGER MEETS

THE DEFINITION OF AN IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE ASSET FOR ACQUISITIONS QUALIFYING AS BUSINESS COMBINATIONS. AS A RESULT, AS OF THE BEGINNING OF 2002, THE NET BOOK VALUE OF THE COMPANYS REMAINING WORKFORCE-IN-PLACE OF $39 MILLION, ALONG WITH

ASSOCIATED DEFERRED TAX LIABILITIES OF $19 MILLION, WAS RECLASSIFIED TO GOODWILL.

FOR 2001, REPORTED NET INCOME OF $1,291 MILLION WOULD HAVE INCREASED BY $1,556 MILLION TO $2,847 MILLION, ADJUSTED FOR THE EXCLUSION OF GOODWILL AND WORKFORCE-IN-PLACE AMORTIZATION, NET OF TAX EFFECT. REPORTED BASIC

EARNINGS PER SHARE OF $0.19 IN 2001 WOULD HAVE INCREASED BY $0.23 PER SHARE TO $0.42 PER SHARE, AND REPORTED DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE OF $0.19 WOULD HAVE INCREASED BY $0.22 PER SHARE TO $0.41 PER SHARE.

IDENTIFIED INTANGIBLE ASSETS

ACQUISITION-RELATED INTANGIBLES INCLUDE DEVELOPED TECHNOLOGY, TRADEMARKS,

CUSTOMER LISTS AND WORKFORCE-IN-PLACE, AND ARE AMORTIZED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER PERIODS RANGING FROM 26 YEARS. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY ASSETS PRIMARILY REPRESENT RIGHTS ACQUIRED UNDER TECHNOLOGY LICENSES AND ARE AMORTIZED OVER THE PERIODS

OF BENEFIT, RANGING FROM 210 YEARS, GENERALLY ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS. ALL IDENTIFIED INTANGIBLE ASSETS ARE CLASSIFIED WITHIN OTHER ASSETS ON THE BALANCE SHEET. IN THE QUARTER FOLLOWING THE PERIOD IN WHICH IDENTIFIED INTANGIBLE ASSETS BECOME

FULLY AMORTIZED, THE FULLY AMORTIZED BALANCES ARE REMOVED FROM THE GROSS ASSET AND ACCUMULATED AMORTIZATION AMOUNTS.

THE COMPANY PERFORMS A QUARTERLY REVIEW OF ITS IDENTIFIED INTANGIBLE ASSETS TO DETERMINE IF FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES EXIST WHICH INDICATE THAT THE USEFUL

LIFE IS SHORTER THAN ORIGINALLY ESTIMATED OR THAT THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF ASSETS MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE. IF SUCH FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES DO EXIST, THE COMPANY ASSESSES THE RECOVERABILITY OF IDENTIFIED INTANGIBLE ASSETS BY COMPARING THE PROJECTED

UNDISCOUNTED NET CASH FLOWS ASSOCIATED WITH THE RELATED ASSET OR GROUP OF ASSETS OVER THEIR REMAINING LIVES AGAINST THEIR RESPECTIVE CARRYING AMOUNTS. IMPAIRMENT, IF ANY, IS BASED ON THE EXCESS OF THE CARRYING AMOUNT OVER THE FAIR VALUE OF THOSE

ASSETS.

REVENUE RECOGNITION

THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES NET REVENUE WHEN THE EARNINGS PROCESS IS COMPLETE, AS

EVIDENCED BY AN AGREEMENT WITH THE CUSTOMER, TRANSFER OF TITLE AND ACCEPTANCE, IF APPLICABLE, AS WELL AS FIXED PRICING AND PROBABLE COLLECTIBILITY. BECAUSE OF FREQUENT SALES PRICE REDUCTIONS AND RAPID TECHNOLOGY OBSOLESCENCE IN THE INDUSTRY, SALES

MADE TO DISTRIBUTORS UNDER AGREEMENTS ALLOWING PRICE PROTECTION AND/OR RIGHT OF RETURN ARE DEFERRED UNTIL THE DISTRIBUTORS SELL THE MERCHANDISE. SHIPPING CHARGES BILLED TO CUSTOMERS ARE INCLUDED IN NET REVENUE, AND THE RELATED SHIPPING COSTS ARE

INCLUDED IN COST OF SALES.

PRODUCT WARRANTY

THE COMPANY GENERALLY SELLS PRODUCTS WITH A LIMITED WARRANTY OF PRODUCT

QUALITY AND A LIMITED INDEMNIFICATION OF CUSTOMERS AGAINST INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY INFRINGEMENT CLAIMS RELATED TO THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS. THE COMPANY ACCRUES FOR KNOWN WARRANTY AND INDEMNIFICATION ISSUES IF A LOSS IS PROBABLE AND CAN BE

REASONABLY ESTIMATED, AND ACCRUES FOR ESTIMATED INCURRED BUT UNIDENTIFIED ISSUES BASED ON HISTORICAL ACTIVITY. THE ACCRUAL AND THE RELATED EXPENSE FOR KNOWN ISSUES WERE NOT SIGNIFICANT DURING THE PERIODS PRESENTED. DUE TO PRODUCT TESTING, THE SHORT

TIME BETWEEN PRODUCT SHIPMENT AND THE DETECTION AND CORRECTION OF PRODUCT FAILURES, AND A LOW HISTORICAL RATE OF PAYMENTS ON INDEMNIFICATION CLAIMS, THE ACCRUAL AND RELATED EXPENSE FOR ESTIMATED INCURRED BUT UNIDENTIFIED ISSUES WERE NOT SIGNIFICANT

DURING THE PERIODS PRESENTED.

ADVERTISING

COOPERATIVE ADVERTISING OBLIGATIONS ARE ACCRUED AND THE COSTS EXPENSED AT THE

SAME TIME THE RELATED REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED. ALL OTHER ADVERTISING COSTS ARE EXPENSED AS INCURRED. COOPERATIVE ADVERTISING EXPENSES ARE RECORDED AS MARKETING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE TO THE EXTENT THAT AN ADVERTISING BENEFIT SEPARATE FROM

THE REVENUE TRANSACTION CAN BE IDENTIFIED AND THE CASH PAID DOES NOT EXCEED THE FAIR VALUE OF THAT ADVERTISING BENEFIT RECEIVED. ANY EXCESS OF CASH PAID OVER THE FAIR VALUE OF THE ADVERTISING BENEFIT RECEIVED IS RECORDED AS A REDUCTION OF REVENUE.

ADVERTISING EXPENSE WAS $1.8 BILLION IN 2003 ($1.7 BILLION IN 2002 AND $1.6 BILLION IN 2001).

EMPLOYEE STOCK BENEFIT PLANS

THE COMPANY HAS EMPLOYEE STOCK BENEFIT PLANS, WHICH ARE DESCRIBED MORE FULLY IN NOTE 12: EMPLOYEE STOCK BENEFIT

PLANS. THE COMPANYS STOCK OPTION PLANS ARE ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER THE INTRINSIC VALUE RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT PRINCIPLES OF APB OPINION NO. 25, ACCOUNTING FOR STOCK ISSUED TO EMPLOYEES, AND RELATED INTERPRETATIONS.

BECAUSE THE EXERCISE PRICE OF ALL OPTIONS GRANTED UNDER THESE STOCK OPTION PLANS WAS EQUAL TO THE MARKET PRICE OF THE UNDERLYING COMMON STOCK (DEFINED AS THE AVERAGE OF THE HIGH AND LOW TRADING PRICES REPORTED BY THE NASDAQ STOCK MARKET*) ON THE

GRANT DATE, NO STOCK-BASED EMPLOYEE COMPENSATION, OTHER THAN ACQUISITION-RELATED COMPENSATION, IS RECOGNIZED IN NET INCOME. THE FOLLOWING TABLE ILLUSTRATES THE EFFECT ON NET INCOME AND EARNINGS PER SHARE IF THE COMPANY HAD APPLIED THE FAIR VALUE

RECOGNITION PROVISIONS OF SFAS NO. 123, ACCOUNTING FOR STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION, AS AMENDED, TO OPTIONS GRANTED UNDER THE STOCK OPTION PLANS AND RIGHTS TO ACQUIRE STOCK GRANTED UNDER THE COMPANYS STOCK PARTICIPATION PLAN,

COLLECTIVELY CALLED OPTIONS. FOR PURPOSES OF THIS PRO-FORMA DISCLOSURE, THE VALUE OF THE OPTIONS IS ESTIMATED USING A BLACK-SCHOLES OPTION PRICING MODEL AND AMORTIZED RATABLY TO EXPENSE OVER THE OPTIONS VESTING PERIODS. BECAUSE THE

ESTIMATED VALUE IS DETERMINED AS OF THE DATE OF GRANT, THE ACTUAL VALUE ULTIMATELY REALIZED BY THE EMPLOYEE MAY BE SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT.

RELATED TAX EFFECTS TOTALING $190 MILLION IN 2003 ($87 MILLION IN 2002 AND $93 MILLION IN 2001).

SFAS NO. 123 REQUIRES THE USE OF OPTION PRICING MODELS THAT WERE NOT DEVELOPED FOR USE IN VALUING EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTIONS. THE BLACK-SCHOLES OPTION PRICING

MODEL WAS DEVELOPED FOR USE IN ESTIMATING THE FAIR VALUE OF SHORT-LIVED EXCHANGE-TRADED OPTIONS THAT HAVE NO VESTING RESTRICTIONS AND ARE FULLY TRANSFERABLE. IN ADDITION, OPTION PRICING MODELS REQUIRE THE INPUT OF HIGHLY SUBJECTIVE ASSUMPTIONS,

INCLUDING THE OPTIONS EXPECTED LIFE AND THE PRICE VOLATILITY OF THE UNDERLYING STOCK. BECAUSE THE COMPANYS EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTIONS HAVE CHARACTERISTICS SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT FROM THOSE OF TRADED OPTIONS, AND BECAUSE CHANGES IN THE

SUBJECTIVE INPUT ASSUMPTIONS CAN MATERIALLY AFFECT THE FAIR VALUE ESTIMATE, IN THE OPINION OF MANAGEMENT, THE EXISTING MODELS DO NOT NECESSARILY PROVIDE A RELIABLE SINGLE MEASURE OF THE FAIR VALUE OF EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTIONS. SEE NOTE 12.

EMPLOYEE STOCK BENEFIT PLANS FOR A DISCUSSION OF THE ASSUMPTIONS USED IN THE OPTION PRICING MODEL AND ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTIONS.

RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD (FASB) ISSUED INTERPRETATION NO. 46 (FIN 46), CONSOLIDATION OF VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES, IN JANUARY

2003 AND AMENDED THE INTERPRETATION IN DECEMBER 2003. FIN 46 REQUIRES AN INVESTOR WITH A MAJORITY OF THE VARIABLE INTERESTS (PRIMARY BENEFICIARY) IN A VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITY (VIE) TO CONSOLIDATE THE ENTITY AND ALSO REQUIRES MAJORITY AND

SIGNIFICANT VARIABLE INTEREST INVESTORS TO PROVIDE CERTAIN DISCLOSURES. A VIE IS AN ENTITY IN WHICH THE VOTING EQUITY INVESTORS DO NOT HAVE A CONTROLLING FINANCIAL INTEREST OR THE EQUITY INVESTMENT AT RISK IS INSUFFICIENT TO FINANCE THE

ENTITYS ACTIVITIES WITHOUT RECEIVING ADDITIONAL SUBORDINATED FINANCIAL SUPPORT FROM THE OTHER PARTIES. DEVELOPMENT-STAGE ENTITIES THAT HAVE SUFFICIENT EQUITY INVESTED TO FINANCE THE ACTIVITIES THEY ARE CURRENTLY ENGAGED IN AND ENTITIES THAT

ARE BUSINESSES, AS DEFINED IN THE INTERPRETATION, ARE NOT CONSIDERED VIES. THE PROVISIONS OF FIN 46 WERE EFFECTIVE IMMEDIATELY FOR ALL ARRANGEMENTS ENTERED INTO WITH NEW VIES CREATED AFTER JANUARY 31, 2003, AND INTEL HAS ELECTED TO APPLY THE

REMAINING PROVISIONS OF THE INTERPRETATION FOR THE PERIOD ENDING DECEMBER 27, 2003. INTEL HAS COMPLETED A REVIEW OF ITS INVESTMENTS IN BOTH NON-MARKETABLE AND MARKETABLE EQUITY SECURITIES AS WELL AS OTHER ARRANGEMENTS TO DETERMINE WHETHER INTEL IS

THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY OF ANY VIES. THE REVIEW DID NOT IDENTIFY ANY VIES THAT WOULD REQUIRE CONSOLIDATION OR ANY SIGNIFICANT EXPOSURE TO VIES THAT WOULD REQUIRE DISCLOSURE.

OF DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE BECAUSE THE EXERCISE PRICES OF THE STOCK OPTIONS WERE GREATER THAN OR EQUAL TO THE AVERAGE PRICE OF THE COMMON SHARES, AND THEREFORE THEIR INCLUSION WOULD HAVE BEEN ANTI-DILUTIVE (387 MILLION IN 2002 AND 211 MILLION IN

2001). THESE OPTIONS COULD BE DILUTIVE IN THE FUTURE IF THE AVERAGE SHARE PRICE INCREASES AND IS EQUAL TO OR GREATER THAN THE EXERCISE PRICE OF THESE OPTIONS.

NOTE 4:  COMMON STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM

THE COMPANY HAS AN ONGOING AUTHORIZATION, AS AMENDED, FROM THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS TO REPURCHASE UP TO 2.3 BILLION SHARES OF INTELS COMMON STOCK IN

OPEN MARKET OR NEGOTIATED TRANSACTIONS. DURING 2003, THE COMPANY REPURCHASED 176 MILLION SHARES OF COMMON STOCK AT A COST OF $4 BILLION. DURING 2002, THE COMPANY REPURCHASED 183 MILLION SHARES OF COMMON STOCK AT A COST OF $4 BILLION

(133 MILLION SHARES AT A COST OF $4 BILLION DURING 2001). SINCE THE PROGRAM BEGAN IN 1990, THE COMPANY HAS REPURCHASED AND RETIRED APPROXIMATELY 1.9 BILLION SHARES AT A COST OF $34 BILLION. AS OF DECEMBER 27, 2003, APPROXIMATELY 414 MILLION

HOLDERS OF THE COMPANYS ZERO COUPON SENIOR

EXCHANGEABLE NOTES (INTEL NOTES) HAD THE RIGHT, PRIOR TO JANUARY 12, 2004, TO EXCHANGE THEIR INTEL NOTES FOR SAMSUNG ELECTRONICS CO., LTD. CONVERTIBLE NOTES (SAMSUNG NOTES) OWNED BY INTEL. THE EXCHANGEABLE NOTES WERE ISSUED IN ORDER TO PARTIALLY

MITIGATE THE EQUITY MARKET RISK OF INTELS INVESTMENT IN THE SAMSUNG NOTES, AND THE EXCHANGE OPTION HAS BEEN ACCOUNTED FOR AS AN EQUITY DERIVATIVE AND MARKED-TO-MARKET WITH THE FAIR VALUE RECORDED IN LONG-TERM DEBT. DURING 2003, THE HOLDERS

EXCHANGED INTEL NOTES WITH A PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF $57 MILLION ($122 MILLION IN 2002). IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE TERMS OF THE INTEL NOTES, THE COMPANY DELIVERED A PORTION OF ITS INVESTMENT IN THE SAMSUNG NOTES WITH A FACE VALUE OF APPROXIMATELY $29

MILLION TO THE HOLDERS IN EXCHANGE FOR INTEL NOTES ($61 MILLION IN 2002). THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE DEBT INSTRUMENT, EXCLUDING THE PORTION ALLOCATED TO THE EQUITY DERIVATIVE, IS BEING ACCRETED TO ITS REMAINING PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF $21 MILLION THROUGH

INTEREST EXPENSE OVER THE PERIOD TO ITS MATURITY. THE INTEL NOTES ARE CLASSIFIED AS SHORT-TERM DEBT AT DECEMBER 27, 2003. SUBSEQUENT TO DECEMBER 27, 2003, SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE REMAINING INTEL NOTE HOLDERS HAVE EXERCISED THEIR RIGHT TO EXCHANGE

THEIR INTEL NOTES FOR SAMSUNG NOTES OWNED BY INTEL.

THE EURO

BORROWINGS WERE MADE IN CONNECTION WITH THE FINANCING OF MANUFACTURING FACILITIES AND EQUIPMENT IN IRELAND, AND INTEL HAS INVESTED THE PROCEEDS IN EURO-DENOMINATED INSTRUMENTS OF SIMILAR MATURITY TO HEDGE CURRENCY AND INTEREST RATE EXPOSURES.

NOTE 8:  CONCENTRATIONS

OF CREDIT RISK

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS THAT POTENTIALLY

SUBJECT THE COMPANY TO CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK CONSIST PRINCIPALLY OF INVESTMENTS IN DEBT SECURITIES, DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND TRADE RECEIVABLES. INTEL GENERALLY PLACES ITS INVESTMENTS WITH HIGH-CREDIT-QUALITY COUNTERPARTIES AND,

BY POLICY, LIMITS THE AMOUNT OF CREDIT EXPOSURE TO ANY ONE COUNTERPARTY BASED ON INTELS ANALYSIS OF THAT COUNTERPARTYS RELATIVE CREDIT STANDING. INVESTMENTS IN DEBT SECURITIES WITH ORIGINAL MATURITIES OF GREATER THAN SIX MONTHS CONSIST

PRIMARILY OF A AND A2 OR BETTER RATED FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND COUNTERPARTIES. INVESTMENTS WITH ORIGINAL MATURITIES OF UP TO SIX MONTHS CONSIST PRIMARILY OF A-1 AND P-1 OR BETTER RATED FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND COUNTERPARTIES. GOVERNMENT

REGULATIONS IMPOSED ON INVESTMENT ALTERNATIVES OF INTELS NON-U.S. SUBSIDIARIES, OR THE ABSENCE OF A AND A2 RATED COUNTERPARTIES IN CERTAIN COUNTRIES, RESULT IN SOME MINOR EXCEPTIONS, WHICH ARE REVIEWED AND APPROVED BY THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS

ANNUALLY. CREDIT RATING CRITERIA FOR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS ARE SIMILAR TO THOSE FOR INVESTMENTS. THE AMOUNTS SUBJECT TO CREDIT RISK RELATED TO DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS ARE GENERALLY LIMITED TO THE AMOUNTS, IF ANY, BY WHICH A COUNTERPARTYS

OBLIGATIONS EXCEED THE OBLIGATIONS OF INTEL WITH THAT COUNTERPARTY. AT DECEMBER 27, 2003, DEBT INVESTMENTS WERE PLACED WITH APPROXIMATELY 220 DIFFERENT COUNTERPARTIES. INTELS PRACTICE IS TO OBTAIN AND SECURE AVAILABLE COLLATERAL FROM

COUNTERPARTIES AGAINST OBLIGATIONS, INCLUDING SECURITIES LENDING TRANSACTIONS, WHENEVER INTEL DEEMS APPROPRIATE.

A MAJORITY OF THE COMPANYS TRADE RECEIVABLES ARE DERIVED FROM SALES TO ORIGINAL EQUIPMENT

MANUFACTURERS AND ORIGINAL DESIGN MANUFACTURERS OF COMPUTER SYSTEMS, CELLULAR HANDSETS AND HANDHELD COMPUTING DEVICES, NETWORKING AND COMMUNICATIONS EQUIPMENT, AND PERIPHERALS. THE COMPANYS THREE LARGEST CUSTOMERS ACCOUNTED FOR APPROXIMATELY

42% OF NET REVENUE FOR 2003, AN INCREASE FROM 38% FOR 2002 (35% OF NET REVENUE FOR 2001). AT DECEMBER 27, 2003, THE THREE LARGEST CUSTOMERS ACCOUNTED FOR APPROXIMATELY 43% OF NET ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE (39% OF NET ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AT DECEMBER 28,

2002).

THE COMPANY HAS ADOPTED CREDIT POLICIES AND STANDARDS

INTENDED TO ACCOMMODATE INDUSTRY GROWTH AND INHERENT RISK. MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT CREDIT RISKS ARE MODERATED BY THE FINANCIAL STABILITY OF THE COMPANYS END CUSTOMERS AND THE DIVERSE GEOGRAPHIC SALES AREAS. TO ASSESS THE CREDIT RISK OF

COUNTERPARTIES, A QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE ANALYSIS IS PERFORMED. FROM THIS ANALYSIS, CREDIT LIMITS ARE ESTABLISHED AND A DETERMINATION IS MADE WHETHER ONE OR MORE CREDIT SUPPORT DEVICES, SUCH AS OBTAINING SOME FORM OF THIRD-PARTY GUARANTY OR

STANDBY LETTER OF CREDIT, OR OBTAINING CREDIT INSURANCE FOR ALL OR A PORTION OF THE ACCOUNT BALANCE, IS NECESSARY.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

DURING 2001, THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE (IRS) COMMENCED AN EXAMINATION OF INTELS TAX RETURNS

FOR THE YEARS 1999 AND 2000. IN AUGUST 2003, THE IRS PROPOSED CERTAIN ADJUSTMENTS TO THE AMOUNTS REFLECTED BY INTEL ON THESE RETURNS AS A TAX BENEFIT FOR ITS EXPORT SALES (SEE NOTE 21: CONTINGENCIES). IN JANUARY 2004, THE IRS COMMENCED

AN EXAMINATION OF INTELS TAX RETURNS FOR THE YEARS 2001 AND 2002. ALTHOUGH THE OUTCOME OF TAX AUDITS IS ALWAYS UNCERTAIN, BASED ON CURRENTLY AVAILABLE INFORMATION, MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT THE ULTIMATE OUTCOME WILL NOT HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE

EFFECT ON THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL POSITION, CASH FLOWS OR OVERALL TRENDS IN RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

DEFERRED INCOME TAXES REFLECT THE NET TAX EFFECTS OF TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES FOR FINANCIAL REPORTING

PURPOSES AND THE AMOUNTS USED FOR INCOME TAX PURPOSES.

NOTE 12:  EMPLOYEE STOCK BENEFIT PLANS

STOCK OPTION PLANS

THE COMPANY HAS A STOCK OPTION PLAN UNDER WHICH OFFICERS, KEY EMPLOYEES AND NON-EMPLOYEE DIRECTORS MAY BE GRANTED OPTIONS TO PURCHASE SHARES OF THE

COMPANYS AUTHORIZED BUT UNISSUED COMMON STOCK. THIS PLAN EXPIRES IN MAY 2004. THE COMPANY ALSO HAS A BROAD-BASED STOCK OPTION PLAN UNDER WHICH STOCK OPTIONS MAY BE GRANTED TO ALL EMPLOYEES OTHER THAN OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS. THIS PLAN EXPIRES

IN JANUARY 2007. AS OF DECEMBER 27, 2003, SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR EMPLOYEES WERE PARTICIPATING IN ONE OF THE STOCK OPTION PLANS. THE COMPANY PRESENTLY EXPECTS TO PROPOSE A NEW EQUITY PLAN FOR STOCKHOLDER VOTE AT ITS MAY 2004 ANNUAL

STOCKHOLDERS MEETING. CONTINGENT ON STOCKHOLDER APPROVAL, THIS NEW EQUITY PLAN WOULD REPLACE BOTH OF THE EXISTING PLANS. THE COMPANYS EXECUTIVE LONG-TERM STOCK OPTION PLAN, UNDER WHICH CERTAIN KEY EMPLOYEES, INCLUDING OFFICERS, WERE

GRANTED STOCK OPTIONS, TERMINATED IN 1998. IN PRIOR YEARS, INTEL ALSO ASSUMED THE STOCK OPTION PLANS AND THE OUTSTANDING OPTIONS OF CERTAIN ACQUIRED COMPANIES. NO ADDITIONAL STOCK GRANTS WILL BE MADE UNDER THE EXECUTIVE LONG-TERM STOCK OPTION PLAN

OR THE ASSUMED PLANS. OPTIONS GRANTED BY INTEL CURRENTLY EXPIRE NO LATER THAN 10 YEARS FROM THE GRANT DATE. OPTIONS GRANTED IN 2003 TO EXISTING AND NEWLY HIRED EMPLOYEES GENERALLY VEST IN INCREMENTS OVER FOUR OR FIVE YEARS FROM THE DATE OF GRANT,

AND CERTAIN GRANTS TO KEY EMPLOYEES HAVE DELAYED VESTING, GENERALLY BEGINNING SIX YEARS FROM THE DATE OF GRANT. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO STOCK OPTION PLAN ACTIVITY IS AS FOLLOWS.

IN DECEMBER 2003, THE

BOARD OF DIRECTORS APPROVED A REDUCTION IN THE NUMBER OF SHARES AUTHORIZED FOR ISSUANCE UNDER THE BROAD-BASED STOCK OPTION PLAN, REDUCING THE NUMBER OF SHARES AVAILABLE FOR ISSUANCE BY 325 MILLION. THIS AMOUNT WAS NOT EXPECTED TO BE UTILIZED FOR

FUTURE GRANTS, AFTER TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE CURRENT AVERAGE RUN-RATE OF GRANTS PER YEAR AND THE REMAINING LIFE OF THE PLAN.

IN NOVEMBER 2002, A SUPPLEMENTAL STOCK OPTION GRANT WAS GIVEN TO EMPLOYEES WHO HAD PREVIOUSLY BEEN GRANTED OPTIONS IN 2001 AND 2000 THAT HAD EXERCISE

PRICES ABOVE THE NOVEMBER 2002 MARKET PRICE. THIS 2002 SUPPLEMENTAL GRANT WAS MADE IN ORDER TO RETAIN EMPLOYEES, DUE TO COMPETITIVE MARKET CONDITIONS AND A DECLINE IN THE COMPANYS STOCK PRICE. THE 2002 SUPPLEMENTAL OPTIONS VEST IN EQUAL

AMOUNTS OVER FOUR YEARS. A SUPPLEMENTAL STOCK GRANT WAS ALSO MADE IN 2001, VESTING IN EQUAL AMOUNTS IN 2002 AND 2003.

BENEFIT PLANS

PROFIT SHARING PLANS

THE COMPANY PROVIDES TAX-QUALIFIED PROFIT-SHARING RETIREMENT PLANS FOR THE

BENEFIT OF ELIGIBLE EMPLOYEES, FORMER EMPLOYEES AND RETIREES IN THE U.S. AND CERTAIN OTHER COUNTRIES. THE PLANS ARE DESIGNED TO PROVIDE EMPLOYEES WITH AN ACCUMULATION OF FUNDS FOR RETIREMENT ON A TAX-DEFERRED BASIS AND PROVIDE FOR ANNUAL

DISCRETIONARY EMPLOYER CONTRIBUTIONS. AMOUNTS TO BE CONTRIBUTED ARE DETERMINED BY THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER OF THE COMPANY UNDER DELEGATION OF AUTHORITY FROM THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS, PURSUANT TO THE TERMS OF THE PROFIT SHARING PLAN. SUBSTANTIALLY

ALL OF THE ASSETS AS OF DECEMBER 27, 2003 HAVE BEEN ALLOCATED TO AN EQUITY INDEX FUND MANAGED BY AN OUTSIDE FUND MANAGER, CONSISTENT WITH THE INVESTMENT POLICY FOR THE PROFIT SHARING PLAN.

THE COMPANY ALSO PROVIDES A NON-QUALIFIED PROFIT-SHARING RETIREMENT PLAN FOR

THE BENEFIT OF ELIGIBLE EMPLOYEES IN THE U.S. THIS PLAN IS DESIGNED TO PERMIT CERTAIN DISCRETIONARY EMPLOYER CONTRIBUTIONS AND TO PERMIT EMPLOYEE DEFERRAL OF A PORTION OF SALARIES IN EXCESS OF CERTAIN TAX LIMITS AND DEFERRAL OF BONUSES. THIS PLAN IS

UNFUNDED.

THE COMPANY EXPENSED $302 MILLION FOR THE QUALIFIED

AND NON-QUALIFIED PROFIT-SHARING RETIREMENT PLANS IN 2003 ($303 MILLION IN 2002 AND $190 MILLION IN 2001). THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO FUND APPROXIMATELY $291 MILLION FOR THE 2003 CONTRIBUTION TO THE QUALIFIED PLAN AND TO ALLOCATE APPROXIMATELY $3

MILLION FOR THE NON-QUALIFIED PROFIT-SHARING RETIREMENT PLAN.

CONTRIBUTIONS MADE BY THE COMPANY ON BEHALF OF THE EMPLOYEES VEST BASED ON THE EMPLOYEES YEARS OF SERVICE. VESTING BEGINS AFTER THREE YEARS OF SERVICE IN 20% ANNUAL INCREMENTS UNTIL THE EMPLOYEE IS 100% VESTED AFTER SEVEN YEARS.

PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS

U.S. PENSION BENEFITS.

THE COMPANY PROVIDES A TAX-QUALIFIED

DEFINED-BENEFIT PENSION PLAN FOR THE BENEFIT OF ELIGIBLE EMPLOYEES AND RETIREES IN THE U.S. THE PLAN PROVIDES FOR A MINIMUM PENSION BENEFIT THAT IS DETERMINED BY A PARTICIPANTS YEARS OF SERVICE, FINAL AVERAGE COMPENSATION (TAKING INTO ACCOUNT

THE PARTICIPANTS SOCIAL SECURITY WAGE BASE) AND THE VALUE OF THE COMPANYS CONTRIBUTIONS, PLUS EARNINGS, IN THE PROFIT SHARING PLAN. IF THE PENSION BENEFIT EXCEEDS THE PARTICIPANTS BALANCE IN THE PROFIT SHARING PLAN, THE PARTICIPANT

WILL RECEIVE A COMBINATION OF PENSION AND PROFIT-SHARING AMOUNTS EQUAL TO THE PENSION BENEFIT. HOWEVER, THE PARTICIPANT WILL RECEIVE ONLY THE BENEFIT FROM THE PROFIT SHARING PLAN IF SUCH BENEFIT IS GREATER THAN THE VALUE OF THE PENSION BENEFIT. THE

U.S DEFINED-BENEFIT PLANS PROJECTED BENEFIT OBLIGATION ASSUMES FUTURE CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE PROFIT SHARING PLAN, AND IF THE COMPANY DOES NOT CONTINUE TO CONTRIBUTE TO OR SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCES CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE PROFIT SHARING PLAN, THE U.S.

DEFINED-BENEFIT PLAN PROJECTED BENEFIT OBLIGATION COULD INCREASE SIGNIFICANTLY. HISTORICALLY, THE COMPANY HAS CONTRIBUTED 8% TO 12.5% OF PARTICIPANTS ELIGIBLE COMPENSATION TO THE PROFIT SHARING PLAN ON AN ANNUAL BASIS. THE BENEFIT OBLIGATION

AND RELATED ASSETS UNDER THIS PLAN HAVE BEEN MEASURED AS OF NOVEMBER 30, 2003.

NON-U.S. PENSION BENEFITS.

THE COMPANY ALSO PROVIDES DEFINED-BENEFIT PENSION PLANS IN CERTAIN OTHER COUNTRIES. THE COMPANY DEPOSITS FUNDS FOR CERTAIN OF THESE PLANS, CONSISTENT WITH THE REQUIREMENTS

OF LOCAL LAW, WITH INSURANCE COMPANIES, THIRD-PARTY TRUSTEES, OR INTO GOVERNMENT-MANAGED ACCOUNTS, AND/OR ACCRUES FOR THE UNFUNDED PORTION OF THE OBLIGATION. THE ASSUMPTIONS USED IN CALCULATING

THE OBLIGATION FOR THE NON-U.S. PLANS DEPEND ON THE LOCAL ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT. THE BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS AND RELATED ASSETS UNDER THESE PLANS HAVE BEEN

MEASURED AS OF DECEMBER 27, 2003.

POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL

BENEFITS.

UPON RETIREMENT, ELIGIBLE U.S. EMPLOYEES ARE CREDITED WITH A DEFINED DOLLAR AMOUNT BASED ON YEARS OF SERVICE. THESE CREDITS CAN BE USED TO PAY ALL OR A PORTION OF THE COST TO PURCHASE COVERAGE IN AN INTEL-SPONSORED MEDICAL

PLAN.

FUNDING POLICY.

THE COMPANYS

PRACTICE IS TO FUND THE VARIOUS PENSION PLANS IN AMOUNTS AT LEAST SUFFICIENT TO MEET THE MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS OF U.S. FEDERAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS OR APPLICABLE LOCAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS. THE ASSETS OF THE VARIOUS PLANS ARE INVESTED IN CORPORATE

EQUITIES, CORPORATE DEBT SECURITIES, GOVERNMENT SECURITIES AND OTHER INSTITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENTS. THE PORTFOLIO OF EACH PLAN DEPENDS ON PLAN DESIGN AND APPLICABLE LOCAL LAWS. DEPENDING ON THE DESIGN OF THE PLAN, AND LOCAL CUSTOM AND MARKET

CIRCUMSTANCES, THE MINIMUM LIABILITIES OF A PLAN MAY EXCEED QUALIFIED PLAN ASSETS. THE COMPANY ACCRUES FOR ALL SUCH LIABILITIES.

U.S. PLAN ASSETS

THE COMPANYS U.S. PENSION PLAN ASSET ALLOCATION

AT THE END OF FISCAL 2003 AND 2002 WAS 100% ALLOCATED TO EQUITY SECURITIES. THE TARGET ALLOCATION FOR 2004 IS EXPECTED TO REMAIN THE SAME. THE EXPECTED LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN FOR THESE EQUITY SECURITIES IS 8%. THE COMPANYS LONG-TERM

INVESTMENT GOAL IS TO PROVIDE A BASIC LEVEL OF BENEFITS THROUGH THE U.S. PENSION PLAN GUARANTEE, WITH AN OPPORTUNITY FOR PARTICIPANTS TO ACCUMULATE FUNDS IN EXCESS OF AMOUNTS GUARANTEED BY THE U.S. PENSION PLAN THROUGH ASSET ACCUMULATION IN THE

PROFIT SHARING PLAN. THE U.S. PLAN ASSETS ARE INVESTED IN EQUITY SECURITIES, PRIMARILY IN LARGE, DIVERSIFIED DOMESTIC AND MULTINATIONAL U.S. EQUITIES, WHICH SEEK TO MATCH THE PERFORMANCE OF THE STANDARD AND POORS 500 INDEX*. THE COMPANY

BELIEVES THAT INVESTING IN LARGE, MULTINATIONAL COMPANIES ACHIEVES ADEQUATE DIVERSITY, IN THAT SUCH COMPANIES REPRESENT A WIDE RANGE OF INDUSTRIES, AND MANY OF THOSE COMPANIES DERIVE A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THEIR REVENUE FROM NON-U.S. SOURCES OR

OTHERWISE REFLECT MARKET CONDITIONS THROUGHOUT THE WORLD. WHEN DEEMED APPROPRIATE, A PORTION OF THE FUND MAY BE INVESTED IN FUTURES CONTRACTS FOR THE PURPOSE OF ACTING AS A TEMPORARY SUBSTITUTE FOR INVESTMENT IN EQUITY SECURITIES. THE FUND DOES NOT

ENGAGE IN SPECULATIVE FUTURES TRANSACTIONS.

IN ORDER TO

DETERMINE THE EXPECTED LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN FOR THE U.S. PLAN ASSETS, THE COMPANY USED ACTUARIAL AND STATISTICAL METHODS TO ESTIMATE THE LIKELY RESULTS OVER A 20-YEAR TIME HORIZON. THE ANALYSIS WAS BASED ON HISTORICAL EQUITY MARKET RETURNS

DURING THE PERIOD FROM 1926 TO 2002. MANAGEMENT SELECTED A RATE OF RETURN WITHIN THE LIKELY RANGE REFLECTING A CONSERVATIVE VIEW OF FUTURE EXPECTED RETURNS.

FUNDING EXPECTATION FOR 2004

NOTE 14:  BUSINESS COMBINATIONS AND DIVESTITURES

ALL OF THE COMPANYS QUALIFYING BUSINESS COMBINATIONS HAVE BEEN

ACCOUNTED FOR USING THE PURCHASE METHOD OF ACCOUNTING. CONSIDERATION INCLUDES THE CASH PAID AND THE VALUE OF ANY STOCK ISSUED AND OPTIONS ASSUMED, LESS ANY CASH ACQUIRED, AND EXCLUDES CONTINGENT EMPLOYEE COMPENSATION PAYABLE IN CASH AND ANY DEBT

ASSUMED. THE COMPANY ACCOUNTS FOR THE INTRINSIC VALUE OF STOCK OPTIONS ASSUMED RELATED TO FUTURE SERVICES AS UNEARNED COMPENSATION WITHIN STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY (SEE NOTE 18: ACQUISITION-RELATED UNEARNED STOCK COMPENSATION).

DURING 2003, THE COMPANY COMPLETED ONE ACQUISITION QUALIFYING

AS A BUSINESS COMBINATION IN EXCHANGE FOR TOTAL CASH CONSIDERATION OF APPROXIMATELY $21 MILLION. THERE WERE NO ACQUISITIONS QUALIFYING AS BUSINESS COMBINATIONS IN 2002. THE ACQUISITIONS IN 2001 WERE ENTERED INTO PRIMARILY TO EXPAND INTELS

OPTICAL, WIRED ETHERNET, WIRELESS CONNECTIVITY AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS CAPABILITIES. THE OPERATING RESULTS OF ALL OF THE SIGNIFICANT BUSINESSES ACQUIRED IN 2003 AND 2001 HAVE BEEN INCLUDED IN THE RESULTS OF THE INTEL COMMUNICATIONS GROUP (ICG)

OPERATING SEGMENT FROM THE DATE OF ACQUISITION.

COMBINATIONS IN THE ABOVE SUMMARY REPRESENT SEVEN BUSINESS COMBINATION TRANSACTIONS IN 2001 THAT WERE NOT INDIVIDUALLY SIGNIFICANT.

PURCHASE CONSIDERATION FOR ACQUISITIONS IN 2001 INCLUDED 21.0 MILLION UNREGISTERED SHARES OF INTEL COMMON STOCK. OF THESE SHARES, 5.2 MILLION WERE

CONTINGENT UPON THE CONTINUED EMPLOYMENT OF CERTAIN EMPLOYEES AND/OR MEETING PERFORMANCE CRITERIA, AND APPROXIMATELY 4.8 MILLION OF THE CONTINGENT SHARES HAVE SUBSEQUENTLY BEEN ISSUED. AN ADDITIONAL 900,000 REGISTERED SHARES WERE ISSUABLE TO CERTAIN

EMPLOYEES CONTINGENT UPON MEETING CERTAIN PERFORMANCE CRITERIA. OF THESE SHARES, APPROXIMATELY 700,000 WERE SUBSEQUENTLY ISSUED, AND APPROXIMATELY 200,000 WERE FORFEITED, AS CERTAIN MILESTONES HAD NOT BEEN MET. FOR CONSIDERATION PAYABLE IN SHARES

THAT IS CONTINGENT ON EMPLOYMENT, THE VALUE IS INCLUDED IN PURCHASE CONSIDERATION. ALTHOUGH INCLUDED IN THE TOTAL CONSIDERATION DISCLOSED, THE FAIR VALUE OF SUCH STOCK COMPENSATION IS ALLOCATED TO UNEARNED STOCK COMPENSATION (SEE NOTE 18.

ACQUISITION-RELATED UNEARNED STOCK COMPENSATION) AND IS NOT INCLUDED IN THE ALLOCATION OF PURCHASE PRICE TO ASSETS ACQUIRED. FOR THE 2001 ACQUISITIONS, $224 MILLION IN CASH COMPENSATION WAS CONTINGENT UPON THE CONTINUED EMPLOYMENT OF

CERTAIN EMPLOYEES AND/OR MEETING PERFORMANCE CRITERIA AND WAS NOT INCLUDED IN PURCHASE CONSIDERATION. OF THIS AMOUNT, APPROXIMATELY $168 MILLION WAS PAID AND APPROXIMATELY $11 MILLION WAS FORFEITED. OF THE $45 MILLION IN CASH COMPENSATION REMAINING

TO BE PAID, APPROXIMATELY $13 MILLION WAS NOT YET EARNED AND THUS NOT REFLECTED IN THE COMPANYS BALANCE SHEET AS OF DECEMBER 27, 2003.

DURING 2003, THE COMPANY RECOGNIZED APPROXIMATELY $758 MILLION IN TAX BENEFITS RELATED TO SALES OF THE STOCK OF CERTAIN PREVIOUSLY ACQUIRED COMPANIES,

PRIMARILY DSP COMMUNICATIONS, INC. (DSP), DIALOGIC CORPORATION AND XIRCOM. A NET BENEFIT OF APPROXIMATELY $420 MILLION WAS RECOGNIZED DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2003 ON THE DIVESTITURE OF A PORTION OF THE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY ASSETS OF DSP,

THROUGH THE SALE OF THE STOCK OF DSP. ALSO DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2003, A BENEFIT OF APPROXIMATELY $200 MILLION WAS RECOGNIZED ON THE DIVESTITURE OF A PORTION OF THE ASSETS, PRIMARILY REAL ESTATE, OF DIALOGIC, THROUGH THE SALE OF THE STOCK OF

DIALOGIC. A BENEFIT OF APPROXIMATELY $125 MILLION WAS RECOGNIZED EARLIER IN THE YEAR RELATED TO THE SALE OF A WIRELESS WAN BUSINESS, THROUGH THE SALE OF THE STOCK OF XIRCOM. THE PRE-TAX LOSSES ON THESE SALES FOR FINANCIAL STATEMENT OR BOOK PURPOSES

WERE NOT SIGNIFICANT. THE COMPANY WAS ABLE TO RECOGNIZE TAX LOSSES BECAUSE THE TAX BASIS IN THE ENTITIES EXCEEDED THE BOOK BASIS, AS THE GOODWILL ALLOCATED TO THE TRANSACTIONS FOR FINANCIAL STATEMENT PURPOSES WAS LESS THAN THE AMOUNT THE COMPANY

COULD EFFECTIVELY DEDUCT FOR TAX PURPOSES. DURING 2002, THE COMPANY RECOGNIZED A $75 MILLION TAX BENEFIT RELATED TO SALES OF THE STOCK OF CERTAIN PREVIOUSLY ACQUIRED COMPANIES, PRIMARILY ZIATECH CORPORATION.

DURING 2002, INTEL WROTE OFF ACQUISITION-RELATED IDENTIFIED INTANGIBLES OF $127 MILLION, RELATED TO A

PORTION OF THE DEVELOPED TECHNOLOGY ACQUIRED WITH THE XIRCOM ACQUISITION AND THE ACQUISITION OF TRILLIUM DIGITAL SYSTEMS, INC. THE IMPAIRED DEVELOPED TECHNOLOGY OF XIRCOM PRIMARILY RELATED TO PC ETHERNET CARDS, WHOSE FORECASTED REVENUE DECLINED

SIGNIFICANTLY AS THE MARKET MOVED TO LAN-ON-MOTHERBOARD TECHNOLOGY. THE IMPAIRED DEVELOPED TECHNOLOGY OF TRILLIUM RELATED PRIMARILY TO A CHANGE IN THE PRODUCT ROADMAP FOR TELEPHONY OPERATING-SYSTEMS SOFTWARE THAT RESULTED IN A SIGNIFICANT DECLINE IN

FORECASTED REVENUE FOR THAT TECHNOLOGY. THE AMOUNT OF THE IMPAIRMENTS WAS DETERMINED USING A FAIR-VALUE APPROACH BASED ON DISCOUNTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS. IN 2001, INTEL WROTE OFF ACQUISITION-RELATED IDENTIFIED INTANGIBLES OF $26 MILLION AND GOODWILL

OF $98 MILLION, RELATED TO ACQUISITIONS MADE PRIOR TO 2000.

FOR 2003, $5 MILLION WAS ALLOCATED TO PURCHASED IN-PROCESS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT (IPR&D) AND EXPENSED AT THE TIME OF THE ACQUISITION ($198 MILLION FOR 2001), BECAUSE THE TECHNOLOGICAL FEASIBILITY OF PRODUCTS UNDER DEVELOPMENT HAD NOT

BEEN ESTABLISHED AND NO FUTURE ALTERNATIVE USES EXISTED. THE FAIR VALUE OF THE IPR&D WAS DETERMINED USING THE INCOME APPROACH, WHICH DISCOUNTS EXPECTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS FROM PROJECTS UNDER DEVELOPMENT TO THEIR NET PRESENT VALUE. EACH PROJECT

WAS ANALYZED TO DETERMINE THE TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATIONS INCLUDED; THE UTILIZATION OF CORE TECHNOLOGY; THE COMPLEXITY, COST AND TIME TO COMPLETE DEVELOPMENT; ANY ALTERNATIVE FUTURE USE OR CURRENT TECHNOLOGICAL FEASIBILITY; AND THE STAGE OF

COMPLETION. FUTURE CASH FLOWS WERE ESTIMATED, TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE EXPECTED LIFE CYCLES OF THE PRODUCTS AND THE UNDERLYING TECHNOLOGY, RELEVANT MARKET SIZES AND INDUSTRY TRENDS. THE COMPANY DETERMINED A DISCOUNT RATE FOR EACH PROJECT BASED ON THE

RELATIVE RISKS INHERENT IN THE PROJECTS DEVELOPMENT HORIZON, THE ESTIMATED COSTS OF DEVELOPMENT, AND THE LEVEL OF TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE IN THE PROJECT AND THE INDUSTRY, AMONG OTHER FACTORS.

NOTE 15:  ACQUISITION OF DEVELOPMENT-STAGE OPERATIONS

AN ACQUISITION OF A DEVELOPMENT-STAGE OPERATION DOES NOT QUALIFY AS A

BUSINESS COMBINATION UNDER SFAS NO. 141, BUSINESS COMBINATIONS, AND PURCHASE CONSIDERATION FOR SUCH AN ACQUISITION IS NOT ALLOCATED TO GOODWILL. WORKFORCE-IN-PLACE DOES QUALIFY AS AN IDENTIFIED INTANGIBLE ASSET FOR AN ACQUISITION OF A

DEVELOPMENT-STAGE OPERATION.

DURING 2003, THE COMPANY ACQUIRED

A DEVELOPMENT-STAGE OPERATION IN EXCHANGE FOR TOTAL CASH CONSIDERATION OF APPROXIMATELY $40 MILLION, ALL OF WHICH WAS ALLOCATED TO WORKFORCE-IN-PLACE. DURING 2002, THE COMPANY ACQUIRED THREE DEVELOPMENT-STAGE OPERATIONS IN EXCHANGE FOR TOTAL

CONSIDERATION OF APPROXIMATELY $57 MILLION, WITH APPROXIMATELY $35 MILLION ALLOCATED TO ACQUISITION-RELATED DEVELOPED TECHNOLOGY AND $20 MILLION TO IPR&D, WITH THE REMAINING AMOUNT REPRESENTING THE VALUE OF NET TANGIBLE ASSETS. THE OPERATING

RESULTS OF EACH OF THESE ACQUISITIONS SINCE THE DATE OF ACQUISITION HAVE BEEN INCLUDED IN THE OPERATING RESULTS OF THE ACQUIRING BUSINESS UNIT WITHIN EITHER THE ICG OPERATING SEGMENT OR THE ALL OTHER CATEGORY, AS APPROPRIATE, FOR SEGMENT

REPORTING PURPOSES.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2003, THE COMPANY COMPLETED ITS ANNUAL IMPAIRMENT REVIEW FOR GOODWILL

AND FOUND INDICATORS OF IMPAIRMENT FOR THE WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS AND COMPUTING GROUP (WCCG) REPORTING UNIT. THE WCCG BUSINESS, COMPRISED PRIMARILY OF FLASH MEMORY PRODUCTS AND CELLULAR BASEBAND CHIPSETS, HAS NOT PERFORMED AS MANAGEMENT HAD

EXPECTED. IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2003, IT BECAME APPARENT THAT WCCG WAS NOW EXPECTED TO GROW MORE SLOWLY THAN PREVIOUSLY PROJECTED. A SLOWER-THAN-EXPECTED ROLLOUT OF PRODUCTS AND SLOWER-THAN-EXPECTED CUSTOMER ACCEPTANCE OF OUR PRODUCTS IN THE

BASEBAND CHIPSET BUSINESS, AS WELL AS A DELAY IN THE TRANSITION TO NEXT-GENERATION PHONE NETWORKS, HAVE PUSHED OUT THE FORECASTS FOR SALES INTO HIGH-END DATA CELL PHONES. THESE FACTORS RESULTED IN LOWER GROWTH EXPECTATIONS FOR THE REPORTING UNIT AND

TRIGGERED THE GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT. THE IMPAIRMENT REVIEW REQUIRES A TWO-STEP PROCESS. THE FIRST STEP OF THE REVIEW COMPARES THE FAIR VALUE OF THE REPORTING UNITS WITH SUBSTANTIAL GOODWILL AGAINST THEIR AGGREGATE CARRYING VALUES, INCLUDING GOODWILL.

THE COMPANY ESTIMATED THE FAIR VALUE OF THE WCCG AND ICG REPORTING UNITS USING THE INCOME METHOD OF VALUATION, WHICH INCLUDES THE USE OF ESTIMATED DISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS. BASED ON THE COMPARISON, THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE WCCG REPORTING UNIT EXCEEDED

THE FAIR VALUE. ACCORDINGLY, THE COMPANY PERFORMED THE SECOND STEP OF THE TEST, COMPARING THE IMPLIED FAIR VALUE OF THE WCCG REPORTING UNITS GOODWILL WITH THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF THAT GOODWILL. BASED ON THIS ASSESSMENT, THE COMPANY RECORDED A

NON-CASH IMPAIRMENT CHARGE OF $611 MILLION, WHICH IS INCLUDED AS A COMPONENT OF OPERATING INCOME IN THE ALL OTHER CATEGORY FOR SEGMENT REPORTING PURPOSES.

ALSO DURING 2003, THE GOODWILL RELATED TO ONE OF THE COMPANYS SEED BUSINESSES, INCLUDED IN THE ALL OTHER

CATEGORY, WAS IMPAIRED. SEED BUSINESSES ARE BUSINESSES THAT SUPPORT THE COMPANYS STRATEGIC INITIATIVES. IN ADDITION, GOODWILL IN THE ICG OPERATING SEGMENT DECREASED, PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF GOODWILL ALLOCATED TO DIVESTITURES ON A FAIR VALUE

BASIS IN 2003. DURING 2003, THE COMPANY RECORDED GOODWILL OF $3 MILLION IN CONNECTION WITH A QUALIFYING BUSINESS COMBINATION. IN 2002, NO GOODWILL WAS RECORDED OR IMPAIRED.

UPON ADOPTION OF SFAS NO. 141, WORKFORCE-IN-PLACE NO LONGER MEETS THE DEFINITION OF AN IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE ASSET IN

ACQUISITIONS QUALIFYING AS BUSINESS COMBINATIONS. AS A RESULT, AS OF THE BEGINNING OF 2002, THE NET BOOK VALUE OF THE COMPANYS WORKFORCE-IN-PLACE OF $39 MILLION, ALONG WITH ASSOCIATED DEFERRED TAX LIABILITIES OF $19 MILLION, WAS RECLASSIFIED

TO GOODWILL (SEE GOODWILL UNDER NOTE 2: ACCOUNTING POLICIES).

THE COMPANY RECORDS ACQUISITION-RELATED PURCHASE CONSIDERATION AS UNEARNED STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION IN ACCORDANCE WITH FASB INTERPRETATION NO. 44, ACCOUNTING FOR CERTAIN TRANSACTIONS INVOLVING STOCK COMPENSATION. DURING 2003 AND

2002, THE COMPANY RECORDED NO SUCH UNEARNED STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION. ACQUISITION-RELATED UNEARNED STOCK COMPENSATION INCLUDES THE PORTION OF THE PURCHASE CONSIDERATION RELATED TO SHARES ISSUED CONTINGENT UPON THE CONTINUED EMPLOYMENT OF SELECTED

EMPLOYEE STOCKHOLDERS AND/OR THE COMPLETION OF SPECIFIED MILESTONES. THE UNEARNED STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION ALSO INCLUDES THE INTRINSIC VALUE OF STOCK OPTIONS ASSUMED IN CONNECTION WITH BUSINESS COMBINATIONS THAT IS EARNED AS THE EMPLOYEES PROVIDE

FUTURE SERVICES. THE COMPENSATION IS BEING RECOGNIZED OVER THE PERIOD EARNED, AND THE EXPENSE IS INCLUDED IN THE AMORTIZATION OF ACQUISITION-RELATED INTANGIBLES AND COSTS. AMORTIZATION OF UNEARNED STOCK COMPENSATION WAS $39 MILLION FOR 2003 ($90

MILLION FOR 2002 AND $174 MILLION FOR 2001). FOR 2003, UNEARNED STOCK COMPENSATION IN THE STATEMENT OF STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY WAS REDUCED BY $4 MILLION RELATED TO VARIOUS ADJUSTMENTS ($12 MILLION IN 2002) AND IN 2002 WAS ADDITIONALLY REDUCED

BY $13 MILLION RELATED TO NET LOSSES ON SALES OF BUSINESSES THAT WERE INCLUDED IN OPERATING INCOME.

ONLINE SERVICES WEB HOSTING BUSINESS. THE

COMPANY HAS RECOGNIZED A RELATED $131 MILLION PRE-TAX CHARGE IN COST OF SALES, OF WHICH $106 MILLION WAS RECORDED IN 2002, AND THE REMAINDER WAS RECORDED IN THE FIRST HALF OF 2003 DUE TO AN INCREASE IN THE ESTIMATE OF ASSETS THAT WILL NO LONGER BE

UTILIZED. APPROXIMATELY $123 MILLION OF THE CHARGE RELATED TO THE IMPAIRMENT OF THE WEB HOSTING BUSINESS ASSETS, INCLUDING LEASEHOLD IMPROVEMENTS AND SERVER EQUIPMENT. THE AMOUNT OF THE IMPAIRMENT WAS DETERMINED BASED ON DISCOUNTED FUTURE CASH

FLOWS AND COMPARABLE MARKET PRICES. THE REMAINING $8 MILLION REPRESENTED THE ACCRUAL OF LEASE AND OTHER EXIT-RELATED COSTS. THE TOTAL CHARGE WAS REFLECTED IN THE ALL OTHER CATEGORY FOR SEGMENT REPORTING PURPOSES. FOR BOTH 2003 AND 2002,

THE OPERATING RESULTS OF THIS BUSINESS WERE NOT SIGNIFICANT TO THE RESULTS OF THE COMPANY.

NOTE 20:  COMMITMENTS

THE COMPANY LEASES A PORTION OF ITS CAPITAL EQUIPMENT AND CERTAIN OF ITS FACILITIES UNDER OPERATING LEASES THAT EXPIRE AT VARIOUS DATES THROUGH 2026. RENTAL EXPENSE WAS $149 MILLION IN 2003, $163 MILLION IN 2002 AND $182 MILLION IN 2001.

MINIMUM RENTAL COMMITMENTS UNDER ALL NON-CANCELABLE LEASES WITH AN INITIAL TERM IN EXCESS OF ONE YEAR ARE PAYABLE AS FOLLOWS: 2004$101 MILLION; 2005$83 MILLION; 2006$52 MILLION; 2007$35 MILLION; 2008$29 MILLION; 2009

AND BEYOND$203 MILLION. COMMITMENTS FOR CONSTRUCTION OR PURCHASE OF PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT APPROXIMATED $1.5 BILLION AT DECEMBER 27, 2003. OTHER COMMITMENTS AS OF DECEMBER 27, 2003 TOTALED $317 MILLION. OTHER COMMITMENTS INCLUDED

PAYMENTS DUE UNDER VARIOUS TYPES OF LICENSES, AND NON-CONTINGENT JOINT FUNDING OBLIGATIONS, SUCH AS CO-MARKETING AND CO-DEVELOPMENT INITIATIVES.

NOTE 21:  CONTINGENCIES

TAX MATTERS

IN AUGUST 2003, IN CONNECTION WITH THE IRSS REGULAR EXAMINATION OF INTELS TAX RETURNS FOR THE YEARS 1999 AND 2000, THE IRS PROPOSED CERTAIN

ADJUSTMENTS TO THE AMOUNTS REFLECTED BY INTEL ON THESE RETURNS AS A TAX BENEFIT FOR ITS EXPORT SALES. IF THE IRS ISSUES FORMAL ASSESSMENTS CONSISTENT WITH THE NOTICES AND ULTIMATELY PREVAILS IN ITS POSITION, INTELS FEDERAL INCOME TAX DUE FOR

THESE YEARS WOULD INCREASE BY APPROXIMATELY $600 MILLION, PLUS INTEREST. THE IRS MAY MAKE SIMILAR CLAIMS FOR YEARS SUBSEQUENT TO 2000 IN FUTURE AUDITS.

INTEL DISPUTES THE PROPOSED ADJUSTMENTS AND INTENDS TO PURSUE THIS MATTER THROUGH APPLICABLE IRS AND JUDICIAL PROCEDURES, AS APPROPRIATE. ALTHOUGH THE

FINAL RESOLUTION OF THE PROPOSED ADJUSTMENTS IS UNCERTAIN, BASED ON CURRENTLY AVAILABLE INFORMATION, MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT THE ULTIMATE OUTCOME WILL NOT HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL POSITION, CASH FLOWS OR

OVERALL TRENDS IN RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. IN THE EVENT OF AN UNFAVORABLE RESOLUTION, THERE EXISTS THE POSSIBILITY OF A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON THE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OF THE PERIOD IN WHICH THE MATTER IS ULTIMATELY RESOLVED, OR AN UNFAVORABLE

OUTCOME BECOMES PROBABLE AND REASONABLY ESTIMABLE.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

IN 1997, INTERGRAPH CORPORATION FILED SUIT IN FEDERAL

DISTRICT COURT IN ALABAMA, GENERALLY ALLEGING, AMONG OTHER CLAIMS, THAT INTEL INFRINGED CERTAIN INTERGRAPH PATENTS. IN AUGUST 2001, INTERGRAPH FILED A SECOND SUIT IN THE U.S. DISTRICT COURT FOR THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF TEXAS, ALLEGING THAT THE

INTEL

®

ITANIUM

®

PROCESSOR INFRINGES TWO INTERGRAPH MICROPROCESSOR-RELATED PATENTS, AND SEEKING AN

INJUNCTION AND UNSPECIFIED DAMAGES. IN APRIL 2002, INTEL AND INTERGRAPH ANNOUNCED THAT THEY ENTERED INTO A SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT, PURSUANT TO WHICH THEY AGREED TO SETTLE THE ALABAMA LAWSUIT AND DISMISS IT WITH PREJUDICE. PURSUANT TO THE SETTLEMENT

AGREEMENT, INTEL MADE A CASH PAYMENT OF $300 MILLION TO INTERGRAPH AND IN RETURN RECEIVED A LICENSE UNDER ALL INTERGRAPH PATENTS, EXCLUDING THE PATENTS AT ISSUE IN THE TEXAS CASE. INTEL RECORDED $155 MILLION OF THE PAYMENT AS A CHARGE IN 2002. THE

REMAINING $145 MILLION REPRESENTED THE VALUE OF THE LICENSE RECEIVED AND WAS CAPITALIZED AS AN INTANGIBLE ASSET (SEE NOTE 17: IDENTIFIED INTANGIBLE ASSETS).

UNDER THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT, THE TEXAS CASE WOULD PROCEED TO TRIAL. IF THE PATENTS IN THE TEXAS CASE WERE FOUND TO BE

INFRINGED, NOT INVALID AND ENFORCEABLE, INTEL WOULD PAY INTERGRAPH $150 MILLION WITHIN 30 DAYS OF THE ENTRY OF A FINAL JUDGMENT. IF INTERGRAPH PREVAILED ON EITHER PATENT ON APPEAL, THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT PROVIDES THAT INTEL WOULD PAY INTERGRAPH AN

ADDITIONAL $100 MILLION AND WOULD RECEIVE A LICENSE FOR THE PATENTS AT ISSUE IN THE CASE.

IN OCTOBER 2002, THE TEXAS DISTRICT COURT RULED THAT INTEL INFRINGED BOTH PATENTS AT ISSUE IN THAT

CASE. PURSUANT TO THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT, INTEL PAID INTERGRAPH $150 MILLION. INTEL THEN APPEALED THE TRIAL COURTS DECISION. IN FEBRUARY 2004, THE COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE FEDERAL CIRCUIT FOUND THAT THE DISTRICT COURT ERRED IN CONSTRUING A

CLAIM TERM, REVISED THE CLAIM CONSTRUCTION, VACATED THE DISTRICT COURT RULING AND REMANDED THE CASE TO THE DISTRICT COURT TO DETERMINE IN THE FIRST INSTANCE WHETHER THE INTEL ITANIUM PROCESSOR INFRINGES THE PATENTS. INTEL IS CURRENTLY EVALUATING THE

IMPACT THAT THE COURT OF APPEALS OPINION HAS ON THE 2002 SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT.

IN DECEMBER 2002, INTERGRAPH FILED SUIT IN THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF TEXAS AGAINST DELL INC., GATEWAY INC. AND HEWLETT-PACKARD COMPANY, ALLEGING INFRINGEMENT OF THREE OF INTERGRAPHS PATENTS. THESE THREE PATENTS

ARE A SUBSET OF THE PATENTS THAT WERE THE SUBJECT OF A NOW SETTLED LAWSUIT THAT INTERGRAPH HAD FILED AGAINST INTEL IN ALABAMA. IN MAY 2003, DELL FILED ITS ANSWER AND COUNTERCLAIM AND NAMED INTEL AS WELL AS INTERGRAPH IN A COUNTERCLAIM FOR

DECLARATORY JUDGMENT. NONE OF THE OTHER DEFENDANTS HAVE NAMED INTEL AS A COUNTER-DEFENDANT. THE CLAIM AGAINST INTEL DOES NOT SEEK ANY MONETARY OR OTHER SPECIFIC RELIEF. RATHER, DELL SEEKS A JUDICIAL INTERPRETATION OF THE APRIL 2002 SETTLEMENT AND

LICENSE AGREEMENT BETWEEN INTEL AND INTERGRAPH INSOFAR AS THAT AGREEMENT RELATES TO ANY EXPRESS AND IMPLIED LICENSES AND PATENT EXHAUSTION DEFENSES DELL HAS RAISED TO DEFEND THE INTERGRAPH CLAIMS. DELL HAS ALSO ISSUED A REQUEST FOR INDEMNITY FROM

INTEL FOR ANY DAMAGES AWARDED AGAINST DELL, ALTHOUGH THIS ISSUE HAS NOT BEEN MADE AN ELEMENT OF THE PENDING LITIGATION. INTEL INTENDS TO PARTICIPATE VIGOROUSLY IN THE DEFENSE OF ALL RELEVANT CLAIMS.

IN MAY 2000, VARIOUS PLAINTIFFS FILED A CLASS-ACTION LAWSUIT IN THE U.S.

DISTRICT COURT FOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA, ALLEGING VIOLATIONS OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934 (EXCHANGE ACT) AND RULE 14D-10 OF THE EXCHANGE ACT IN CONNECTION WITH INTELS ACQUISITION OF DSP COMMUNICATIONS, INC. THE

COMPLAINT ALLEGED THAT INTEL AND CWC (INTELS WHOLLY OWNED SUBSIDIARY AT THE TIME) AGREED TO PAY CERTAIN DSP EXECUTIVES ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATION OF $15.6 MILLION NOT OFFERED OR PAID TO OTHER STOCKHOLDERS. THE ALLEGED PURPOSE OF THIS PAYMENT TO

THE INSIDERS WAS TO OBTAIN DSP INSIDERS ENDORSEMENT OF INTELS TENDER OFFER IN VIOLATION OF THE ANTI-DISCRIMINATION PROVISION OF SECTION 14(D)(7) AND RULE 14D-10. THE PLAINTIFFS SOUGHT UNSPECIFIED DAMAGES FOR THE CLASS, AND UNSPECIFIED

COSTS AND EXPENSES. IN JULY 2002, THE DISTRICT COURT GRANTED INTELS MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT, BUT IN OCTOBER 2002, THE DISTRICT COURT VACATED THE SUMMARY JUDGMENT. IN JANUARY 2003, THE PARTIES REACHED A SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT, WHICH WAS

REVIEWED AND APPROVED BY THE COURT IN JUNE 2003. THE SETTLEMENT DID NOT HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE COMPANYS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR FINANCIAL CONDITION.

CROSS-LICENSE AGREEMENT COVERING CERTAIN OF EACH COMPANYS PRODUCTS, SUBJECT TO CERTAIN TERMS AND LIMITATIONS. THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT DID NOT HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE COMPANYS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR FINANCIAL CONDITION.

IN 2001, VARIOUS PLAINTIFFS FILED FIVE CLASS-ACTION LAWSUITS

AGAINST INTEL ALLEGING VIOLATIONS OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934. THESE COMPLAINTS WERE CONSOLIDATED IN AN AMENDED COMPLAINT FILED IN THE U.S. DISTRICT COURT FOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA. THE LAWSUIT ALLEGED THAT PURCHASERS OF

INTEL STOCK BETWEEN JULY 19, 2000 AND SEPTEMBER 29, 2000 WERE MISLED BY FALSE AND MISLEADING STATEMENTS BY INTEL AND CERTAIN OF ITS OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS CONCERNING THE COMPANYS BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. IN JULY 2003, THE COURT

GRANTED INTELS MOTION TO DISMISS THE PLAINTIFFS SECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT IN ITS ENTIRETY WITH PREJUDICE, AND THE PLAINTIFFS DID NOT APPEAL THE COURTS DISMISSAL OF THE SUIT.

IN ADDITION, VARIOUS PLAINTIFFS FILED STOCKHOLDER DERIVATIVE COMPLAINTS IN

CALIFORNIA SUPERIOR COURT AND DELAWARE CHANCERY COURT AGAINST THE COMPANYS DIRECTORS AND CERTAIN OFFICERS, ALLEGING THAT THEY MISMANAGED THE COMPANY AND OTHERWISE BREACHED THEIR FIDUCIARY OBLIGATIONS TO THE COMPANY. THE PLAINTIFFS IN THE

CALIFORNIA ACTION FILED THE ORIGINAL AND TWO SUCCESSIVE AMENDED COMPLAINTS, AND THE CALIFORNIA SUPERIOR COURT SUSTAINED INTELS DEMURRERS ON EACH OF THESE COMPLAINTS. FOLLOWING THE COURTS DISMISSAL WITHOUT PREJUDICE OF THESE COMPLAINTS,

THE PLAINTIFFS NOTIFIED THE COURT AND INTEL IN JUNE 2003 THAT THEY WOULD NOT FILE A FOURTH COMPLAINT, AND THEY SIGNED A STIPULATION WITHDRAWING THEIR LAWSUIT WITH PREJUDICE, WHICH THE COURT APPROVED. IN DECEMBER 2003, THE PLAINTIFFS IN THE DELAWARE

ILLINOIS, AGAINST INTEL, HEWLETT-PACKARD COMPANY, HPDIRECT, INC. AND GATEWAY INC., ALLEGING THAT THE DEFENDANTS ADVERTISEMENTS AND STATEMENTS MISLED THE PUBLIC BY SUPPRESSING AND CONCEALING THE ALLEGED MATERIAL FACT THAT SYSTEMS THAT USE THE

INTEL PENTIUM 4 PROCESSOR ARE LESS POWERFUL AND SLOWER THAN SYSTEMS USING THE INTEL PENTIUM

III

PROCESSOR AND A COMPETITORS

PROCESSORS. THE PLAINTIFFS CLAIM THAT THEIR LAWSUIT SHOULD BE TREATED AS A NATIONWIDE CLASS ACTION. THE PLAINTIFFS SEEK UNSPECIFIED DAMAGES, AND ATTORNEYS FEES AND COSTS. THE COMPANY DISPUTES THE PLAINTIFFS CLAIMS AND INTENDS TO DEFEND

THE LAWSUIT VIGOROUSLY.

THE COMPANY IS CURRENTLY A PARTY TO

VARIOUS CLAIMS AND LEGAL PROCEEDINGS, INCLUDING THOSE NOTED ABOVE. IF MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT A LOSS ARISING FROM THESE MATTERS IS PROBABLE AND CAN REASONABLY BE ESTIMATED, THE COMPANY RECORDS THE AMOUNT OF THE LOSS, OR THE MINIMUM ESTIMATED

LIABILITY WHEN THE LOSS IS ESTIMATED USING A RANGE, AND NO POINT WITHIN THE RANGE IS MORE PROBABLE THAN ANOTHER. AS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION BECOMES AVAILABLE, ANY POTENTIAL LIABILITY RELATED TO THESE MATTERS IS ASSESSED AND THE ESTIMATES ARE REVISED,

IF NECESSARY. BASED ON CURRENTLY AVAILABLE INFORMATION, MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT THE ULTIMATE OUTCOME OF THESE MATTERS, INDIVIDUALLY AND IN THE AGGREGATE, WILL NOT HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL POSITION OR OVERALL

TRENDS IN RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. HOWEVER, LITIGATION IS SUBJECT TO INHERENT UNCERTAINTIES, AND UNFAVORABLE RULINGS COULD OCCUR. AN UNFAVORABLE RULING COULD INCLUDE MONETARY DAMAGES OR AN INJUNCTION PROHIBITING INTEL FROM SELLING ONE OR MORE

PRODUCTS. IF AN UNFAVORABLE RULING WERE TO OCCUR, THERE EXISTS THE POSSIBILITY OF A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON THE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OF THE PERIOD IN WHICH THE RULING OCCURS, OR FUTURE PERIODS.

INTEL HAS BEEN NAMED TO THE CALIFORNIA AND U.S. SUPERFUND LISTS FOR THREE OF

ITS SITES AND HAS COMPLETED, ALONG WITH TWO OTHER COMPANIES, A REMEDIAL INVESTIGATION/FEASIBILITY STUDY WITH THE U.S. ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY (EPA) TO EVALUATE THE GROUNDWATER IN AREAS ADJACENT TO ONE OF ITS FORMER SITES. THE EPA HAS ISSUED

A RECORD OF DECISION WITH RESPECT TO A GROUNDWATER CLEANUP PLAN AT THAT SITE, INCLUDING EXPECTED COSTS TO COMPLETE. UNDER THE CALIFORNIA AND U.S. SUPERFUND STATUTES, LIABILITY FOR CLEANUP OF THIS SITE AND THE ADJACENT AREA IS JOINT AND SEVERAL. THE

COMPANY, HOWEVER, HAS REACHED AGREEMENT WITH THOSE SAME TWO COMPANIES WHICH SIGNIFICANTLY LIMITS THE COMPANYS LIABILITIES UNDER THE PROPOSED CLEANUP PLAN. ALSO, THE COMPANY HAS COMPLETED EXTENSIVE STUDIES AT ITS OTHER SITES AND IS ENGAGED IN

CLEANUP AT SEVERAL OF THESE SITES. IN THE OPINION OF MANAGEMENT, THE POTENTIAL LOSSES TO THE COMPANY IN EXCESS OF AMOUNTS ALREADY ACCRUED ARISING OUT OF THESE MATTERS WOULD NOT HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL POSITION

OR OVERALL TRENDS IN RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, EVEN IF JOINT AND SEVERAL LIABILITY WERE TO BE ASSESSED.

THE ESTIMATE OF THE POTENTIAL IMPACT ON THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL POSITION OR OVERALL RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE ABOVE LEGAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL

PROCEEDINGS COULD CHANGE IN THE FUTURE.

NOTE 22:  OPERATING

SEGMENT AND GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION

THE COMPANY DESIGNS,

DEVELOPS, MANUFACTURES AND MARKETS COMPUTING AND COMMUNICATIONS PRODUCTS AT VARIOUS LEVELS OF INTEGRATION. THE COMPANY CURRENTLY REPORTS THREE PRODUCT-LINE OPERATING SEGMENTS: THE INTEL ARCHITECTURE BUSINESS, WHICH IS COMPOSED OF THE DESKTOP

PLATFORMS GROUP, THE MOBILE PLATFORMS GROUP AND THE ENTERPRISE PLATFORMS GROUP; THE INTEL COMMUNICATIONS GROUP (ICG); AND THE WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS AND COMPUTING GROUP (WCCG). IN DECEMBER 2003, THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED THAT IT WOULD BE CONSOLIDATING

COMMUNICATIONS-RELATED BUSINESSES WITHIN ICG AND WCCG. THIS REORGANIZATION WAS NOT EFFECTIVE UNTIL FISCAL 2004. BECAUSE THIS REPORTING PERIOD IS AS OF DECEMBER 27, 2003, THE OPERATING SEGMENT RESULTS FOR THESE COMMUNICATIONS-RELATED BUSINESSES ARE

PRESENTED UNDER THE ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE THAT EXISTED AS OF DECEMBER 27, 2003.

THE COMPANYS EXECUTIVE OFFICE CONSISTS OF CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER (CEO) CRAIG R. BARRETT AND PRESIDENT AND CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER (COO) PAUL S. OTELLINI. THE CEO AND COO HAVE JOINT RESPONSIBILITY AS THE CHIEF

OPERATING DECISION MAKER (CODM), AS DEFINED BY SFAS NO. 131, DISCLOSURES ABOUT SEGMENTS OF AN ENTERPRISE AND RELATED INFORMATION. THE CODM ALLOCATES RESOURCES TO AND ASSESSES THE PERFORMANCE OF EACH OPERATING SEGMENT USING INFORMATION

ABOUT THEIR REVENUE AND OPERATING PROFIT BEFORE INTEREST AND TAXES.

INTEL CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

THE INTEL ARCHITECTURE OPERATING SEGMENTS PRODUCTS INCLUDE MICROPROCESSORS AND RELATED CHIPSETS

AND MOTHERBOARDS. NET REVENUE FOR THE INTEL ARCHITECTURE OPERATING SEGMENT MADE UP APPROXIMATELY 87% OF THE COMPANYS CONSOLIDATED NET REVENUE IN 2003 (83% IN 2002 AND 81% IN 2001). REVENUE FROM SALES OF MICROPROCESSORS WITHIN THE INTEL

ARCHITECTURE OPERATING SEGMENT REPRESENTED 73% OF CONSOLIDATED NET REVENUE IN 2003 (70% IN 2002 AND 67% IN 2001). ICGS PRODUCTS INCLUDE WIRED ETHERNET AND WIRELESS CONNECTIVITY PRODUCTS, NETWORK PROCESSING COMPONENTS AND EMBEDDED COMPUTING

PRODUCTS. WCCGS PRODUCTS INCLUDE FLASH MEMORY, APPLICATION PROCESSORS, AND CELLULAR BASEBAND CHIPSETS FOR CELLULAR HANDSETS AND HANDHELD DEVICES. THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS IN ALL OPERATING SEGMENTS ARE SOLD DIRECTLY TO ORIGINAL EQUIPMENT

MANUFACTURERS, AND THROUGH RETAIL AND INDUSTRIAL DISTRIBUTORS AS WELL AS RESELLER CHANNELS THROUGHOUT THE WORLD.

IN ADDITION TO THESE OPERATING SEGMENTS, THE COMPANY HAS SALES AND MARKETING, MANUFACTURING, FINANCE AND ADMINISTRATION GROUPS. EXPENSES OF THESE GROUPS

ARE ALLOCATED TO THE OPERATING SEGMENTS AND ARE INCLUDED IN THE OPERATING RESULTS REPORTED BELOW.

THE ALL OTHER CATEGORY INCLUDES ACQUISITION-RELATED COSTS, INCLUDING AMORTIZATION OF ACQUISITION-RELATED INTANGIBLES AND CHARGES FOR PURCHASED

IN-PROCESS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT. IN 2003, ACQUISITION-RELATED COSTS ALSO INCLUDED A GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT CHARGE OF $611 MILLION TAKEN IN THE FOURTH QUARTER FOR THE REMAINING GOODWILL BALANCE RELATED TO WCCG, AND IN 2002 INCLUDED A $127 MILLION

IMPAIRMENT OF ACQUISITION-RELATED IDENTIFIED INTANGIBLES RELATED TO PRIOR-YEAR ACQUISITIONS. ALL OTHER ALSO INCLUDES THE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OF SEED BUSINESSES THAT SUPPORT THE COMPANYS INITIATIVES, AND THE RESULTS FOR 2002

INCLUDED A CHARGE OF $106 MILLION RELATED TO THE WIND-DOWN OF THE INTEL ONLINE SERVICES WEB HOSTING BUSINESS. FINALLY, ALL OTHER INCLUDES CERTAIN CORPORATE-LEVEL OPERATING EXPENSES, INCLUDING A PORTION OF PROFIT-DEPENDENT BONUS AND OTHER

EXPENSES NOT ALLOCATED TO THE OPERATING SEGMENTS. FOR 2001, ALL OTHER ALSO INCLUDED GOODWILL AMORTIZATION; HOWEVER, BEGINNING IN 2002, GOODWILL IS NO LONGER AMORTIZED.

THE COMPANY DOES NOT IDENTIFY OR ALLOCATE ASSETS BY OPERATING SEGMENT, AND DOES NOT ALLOCATE DEPRECIATION AS SUCH TO THE

OPERATING SEGMENTS, NOR DOES THE CODM EVALUATE OPERATING SEGMENTS ON THESE CRITERIA. OPERATING SEGMENTS DO NOT RECORD INTERSEGMENT REVENUE, AND, ACCORDINGLY, THERE IS NONE TO BE REPORTED. THE COMPANY DOES NOT ALLOCATE INTEREST AND OTHER INCOME,

INTEREST EXPENSE OR TAXES TO OPERATING SEGMENTS. EXCEPT AS DISCUSSED ABOVE, THE ACCOUNTING POLICIES FOR SEGMENT REPORTING ARE THE SAME AS FOR THE COMPANY AS A WHOLE.

NET REVENUE AND OPERATING INCOME OR LOSS FOR REPORTABLE SEGMENTS FOR THE THREE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 27, 2003 WERE AS

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

CONTROLS EVALUATION AND RELATED CEO AND CFO CERTIFICATIONS

WE CONDUCTED AN EVALUATION OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE DESIGN AND OPERATION OF OUR DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES (DISCLOSURE CONTROLS) AS

OF THE END OF THE PERIOD COVERED BY THIS ANNUAL REPORT. THE CONTROLS EVALUATION WAS DONE UNDER THE SUPERVISION AND WITH THE PARTICIPATION OF MANAGEMENT, INCLUDING OUR CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER (CEO) AND CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER (CFO).

ATTACHED AS EXHIBITS TO THIS ANNUAL REPORT ARE CERTIFICATIONS OF THE CEO AND

THE CFO, WHICH ARE REQUIRED IN ACCORDANCE WITH RULE 13A-14 OF THE EXCHANGE ACT. THIS CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES SECTION INCLUDES THE INFORMATION CONCERNING THE CONTROLS EVALUATION REFERRED TO IN THE CERTIFICATIONS, AND IT SHOULD BE

READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE CERTIFICATIONS FOR A MORE COMPLETE UNDERSTANDING OF THE TOPICS PRESENTED.

DEFINITION OF DISCLOSURE CONTROLS

DISCLOSURE CONTROLS ARE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES DESIGNED TO REASONABLY ASSURE THAT INFORMATION REQUIRED TO BE DISCLOSED IN OUR REPORTS FILED UNDER THE EXCHANGE ACT, SUCH AS THIS ANNUAL REPORT, IS RECORDED, PROCESSED,

SUMMARIZED AND REPORTED WITHIN THE TIME PERIODS SPECIFIED IN THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSIONS RULES AND FORMS. DISCLOSURE CONTROLS ARE ALSO DESIGNED TO REASONABLY ASSURE THAT SUCH INFORMATION IS ACCUMULATED AND COMMUNICATED TO OUR

MANAGEMENT, INCLUDING THE CEO AND CFO, AS APPROPRIATE TO ALLOW TIMELY DECISIONS REGARDING REQUIRED DISCLOSURE. OUR DISCLOSURE CONTROLS INCLUDE COMPONENTS OF OUR INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, WHICH CONSISTS OF CONTROL PROCESSES DESIGNED

TO PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING THE RELIABILITY OF OUR FINANCIAL REPORTING AND THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES IN THE U.S. TO THE EXTENT THAT COMPONENTS OF OUR INTERNAL

CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING ARE INCLUDED WITHIN OUR DISCLOSURE CONTROLS, THEY ARE INCLUDED IN THE SCOPE OF OUR QUARTERLY CONTROLS EVALUATION.

LIMITATIONS ON THE EFFECTIVENESS OF CONTROLS

THE COMPANYS MANAGEMENT, INCLUDING THE CEO AND CFO, DOES NOT EXPECT THAT OUR DISCLOSURE CONTROLS OR OUR INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

WILL PREVENT ALL ERROR AND ALL FRAUD. A CONTROL SYSTEM, NO MATTER HOW WELL DESIGNED AND OPERATED, CAN PROVIDE ONLY REASONABLE, NOT ABSOLUTE, ASSURANCE THAT THE CONTROL SYSTEMS OBJECTIVES WILL BE MET. FURTHER, THE DESIGN OF A CONTROL SYSTEM

MUST REFLECT THE FACT THAT THERE ARE RESOURCE CONSTRAINTS, AND THE BENEFITS OF CONTROLS MUST BE CONSIDERED RELATIVE TO THEIR COSTS. BECAUSE OF THE INHERENT LIMITATIONS IN ALL CONTROL SYSTEMS, NO EVALUATION OF CONTROLS CAN PROVIDE ABSOLUTE ASSURANCE

THAT ALL CONTROL ISSUES AND INSTANCES OF FRAUD, IF ANY, WITHIN THE COMPANY HAVE BEEN DETECTED. THESE INHERENT LIMITATIONS INCLUDE THE REALITIES THAT JUDGMENTS IN DECISION-MAKING CAN BE FAULTY AND THAT BREAKDOWNS CAN OCCUR BECAUSE OF SIMPLE ERROR OR

MISTAKE. CONTROLS CAN ALSO BE CIRCUMVENTED BY THE INDIVIDUAL ACTS OF SOME PERSONS, BY COLLUSION OF TWO OR MORE PEOPLE, OR BY MANAGEMENT OVERRIDE OF THE CONTROLS. THE DESIGN OF ANY SYSTEM OF CONTROLS IS BASED IN PART ON CERTAIN ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT THE

LIKELIHOOD OF FUTURE EVENTS, AND THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT ANY DESIGN WILL SUCCEED IN ACHIEVING ITS STATED GOALS UNDER ALL POTENTIAL FUTURE CONDITIONS. OVER TIME, CONTROLS MAY BECOME INADEQUATE BECAUSE OF CHANGES IN CONDITIONS OR DETERIORATION

IN THE DEGREE OF COMPLIANCE WITH POLICIES OR PROCEDURES. BECAUSE OF THE INHERENT LIMITATIONS IN A COST-EFFECTIVE CONTROL SYSTEM, MISSTATEMENTS DUE TO ERROR OR FRAUD MAY OCCUR AND NOT BE DETECTED.

SCOPE OF THE CONTROLS EVALUATION

THE EVALUATION OF OUR DISCLOSURE CONTROLS INCLUDED A REVIEW OF THE

CONTROLS OBJECTIVES AND DESIGN, THE COMPANYS IMPLEMENTATION OF THE CONTROLS AND THE EFFECT OF THE CONTROLS ON THE INFORMATION GENERATED FOR USE IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT. IN THE COURSE OF THE CONTROLS EVALUATION, WE SOUGHT TO IDENTIFY DATA

ERRORS, CONTROL PROBLEMS OR ACTS OF FRAUD AND CONFIRM THAT APPROPRIATE CORRECTIVE ACTION, INCLUDING PROCESS IMPROVEMENTS, WERE BEING UNDERTAKEN. THIS TYPE OF EVALUATION IS PERFORMED ON A QUARTERLY BASIS SO THAT THE CONCLUSIONS OF MANAGEMENT,

INCLUDING THE CEO AND CFO, CONCERNING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE CONTROLS CAN BE REPORTED IN OUR QUARTERLY REPORTS ON FORM 10-Q AND TO SUPPLEMENT OUR DISCLOSURES MADE IN OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K. MANY OF THE COMPONENTS OF OUR DISCLOSURE CONTROLS

ARE ALSO EVALUATED ON AN ONGOING BASIS BY OUR INTERNAL AUDIT DEPARTMENT AND BY OTHER PERSONNEL IN OUR FINANCE ORGANIZATION, AS WELL AS OUR INDEPENDENT AUDITORS WHO EVALUATE THEM IN CONNECTION WITH DETERMINING THEIR AUDITING PROCEDURES RELATED

86

TABLE OF CONTENTS

INDEX TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

TO THEIR REPORT ON OUR ANNUAL FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND NOT TO PROVIDE ASSURANCE ON OUR CONTROLS. THE OVERALL GOALS OF THESE VARIOUS EVALUATION ACTIVITIES ARE

TO MONITOR OUR DISCLOSURE CONTROLS, AND TO MODIFY THEM AS NECESSARY. OUR INTENT IS TO MAINTAIN THE DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AS DYNAMIC SYSTEMS THAT CHANGE AS CONDITIONS WARRANT.

AMONG OTHER MATTERS, WE ALSO CONSIDERED WHETHER OUR EVALUATION IDENTIFIED ANY SIGNIFICANT DEFICIENCIES OR

MATERIAL WEAKNESSES IN OUR INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, AND WHETHER THE COMPANY HAD IDENTIFIED ANY ACTS OF FRAUD INVOLVING PERSONNEL WITH A SIGNIFICANT ROLE IN OUR INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING. THIS INFORMATION

WAS IMPORTANT BOTH FOR THE CONTROLS EVALUATION GENERALLY, AND BECAUSE ITEM 5 IN THE CERTIFICATIONS OF THE CEO AND CFO REQUIRES THAT THE CEO AND CFO DISCLOSE THAT INFORMATION TO OUR BOARDS AUDIT COMMITTEE AND TO OUR INDEPENDENT AUDITORS. IN THE

PROFESSIONAL AUDITING LITERATURE, SIGNIFICANT DEFICIENCIES ARE REFERRED TO AS REPORTABLE CONDITIONS, WHICH ARE DEFICIENCIES IN THE DESIGN OR OPERATION OF CONTROLS THAT COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO RECORD, PROCESS,

SUMMARIZE AND REPORT FINANCIAL DATA IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. AUDITING LITERATURE DEFINES MATERIAL WEAKNESS AS A PARTICULARLY SERIOUS REPORTABLE CONDITION IN WHICH THE INTERNAL CONTROL DOES NOT REDUCE TO A RELATIVELY LOW LEVEL THE

RISK THAT MISSTATEMENTS CAUSED BY ERROR OR FRAUD MAY OCCUR IN AMOUNTS THAT WOULD BE MATERIAL IN RELATION TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND THE RISK THAT SUCH MISSTATEMENTS WOULD NOT BE DETECTED WITHIN A TIMELY PERIOD BY EMPLOYEES IN THE NORMAL COURSE

OF PERFORMING THEIR ASSIGNED FUNCTIONS. WE ALSO SOUGHT TO ADDRESS OTHER CONTROLS MATTERS IN THE CONTROLS EVALUATION, AND IN EACH CASE IF A PROBLEM WAS IDENTIFIED, WE CONSIDERED WHAT REVISION, IMPROVEMENT AND/OR CORRECTION TO MAKE IN ACCORDANCE WITH

OUR ONGOING PROCEDURES.

CONCLUSIONS

BASED UPON THE CONTROLS EVALUATION, OUR CEO AND CFO HAVE CONCLUDED THAT,

SUBJECT TO THE LIMITATIONS NOTED ABOVE, AS OF THE END OF THE PERIOD COVERED BY THIS ANNUAL REPORT, OUR DISCLOSURE CONTROLS WERE EFFECTIVE TO PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE THAT MATERIAL INFORMATION RELATING TO INTEL AND ITS CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES

IS MADE KNOWN TO MANAGEMENT, INCLUDING THE CEO AND CFO, PARTICULARLY DURING THE PERIOD WHEN OUR PERIODIC REPORTS ARE BEING PREPARED.
