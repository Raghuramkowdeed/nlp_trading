MICROPROCESSORS.

A MICROPROCESSOR IS THE CENTRAL PROCESSING UNIT OF A COMPUTER SYSTEM. IT

PROCESSES SYSTEM DATA AND CONTROLS OTHER DEVICES IN THE SYSTEM, ACTING AS THE BRAINS OF THE COMPUTER. ONE INDICATOR OF MICROPROCESSOR PERFORMANCE IS ITS CLOCK SPEED, THE RATE AT WHICH ITS INTERNAL

LOGIC OPERATES, WHICH IS MEASURED IN UNITS OF HERTZ, OR CYCLES PROCESSED PER SECOND. ONE MEGAHERTZ (MHZ) EQUALS ONE MILLION CYCLES PROCESSED PER SECOND, AND ONE GIGAHERTZ (GHZ) EQUALS ONE BILLION

CYCLES PROCESSED PER SECOND. OTHER INDICATORS OF CHIP PERFORMANCE ARE MEMORY STORAGE AND ACCESS. THE MEMORY STORED ON A CHIP IS MEASURED IN BYTES, WITH 1,024 BYTES EQUALING ONE KILOBYTE (KB),

1.049 MILLION BYTES EQUALING ONE MEGABYTE (MB), AND 1.074 BILLION BYTES EQUALING ONE GIGABYTE (GB). CACHE IS A MEMORY SUBSYSTEM IN WHICH FREQUENTLY USED DATA IS DUPLICATED FOR QUICK

ACCESS. A SECOND LEVEL OF CACHE (L2) LOCATED DIRECTLY ON THE MICROPROCESSOR, CAN ALSO BE USED TO FURTHER INCREASE SYSTEM PERFORMANCE.

OUR

DEVELOPMENTS IN SEMICONDUCTOR DESIGN AND MANUFACTURING HAVE MADE IT POSSIBLE TO DECREASE THE SIZE OF CIRCUITS ETCHED INTO SILICON, PERMITTING A GREATER NUMBER OF TRANSISTORS TO BE

USED ON EACH

MICROPROCESSOR DIE, AND A GREATER NUMBER OF MICROPROCESSORS TO BE MADE FROM EACH SILICON WAFER. THE RESULT IS SMALLER, FASTER MICROPROCESSORS THAT CONSUME LESS POWER AND COST LESS TO MANUFACTURE. THE

WIDTH OF THE INDIVIDUAL TRANSISTORS ON A CHIP IS MEASURED IN MICRONS; ONE MICRON EQUALS ONE MILLIONTH OF A METER. IN 2000, WE FINISHED CONVERTING SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR MICROPROCESSOR MANUFACTURING

TO THE 0.18-MICRON PROCESS TECHNOLOGY, AND IN NOVEMBER WE ANNOUNCED COMPLETION OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE 0.13-MICRON PROCESS TECHNOLOGY. SEE THE DISCUSSION OF MANUFACTURING

PROCESS TECHNOLOGIES UNDER THE HEADING "MANUFACTURING, ASSEMBLY AND TEST" IN PART I, ITEM 1 OF THIS FORM 10-K.

IN

CONTINUED DEVELOPMENT OF OUR NEXT-GENERATION 64-BIT PROCESSOR FOR HIGH-END SERVERS AND WORKSTATIONS, THE INTEL ITANIUM PROCESSOR.

THIS MICROPROCESSOR WILL EXPAND THE CAPABILITIES OF THE INTEL ARCHITECTURE TO ADDRESS THE HIGH-PERFORMANCE SERVER AND WORKSTATION MARKET SEGMENTS, WHILE STILL RUNNING THE SOFTWARE THAT

CURRENTLY OPERATES ON MACHINES BASED ON OUR 32-BIT PROCESSORS. A 64-BIT MICROPROCESSOR IS MORE COMPLEX THAN A 32-BIT MICROPROCESSOR AND REQUIRES A MORE COMPLEX

SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE, BUT IT CAN HANDLE TWICE AS MUCH DATA IN EACH CLOCK CYCLE. THUS, A 64-BIT PROCESSOR ENABLES MOST DATA-INTENSIVE APPLICATIONS, SUCH AS ENTERPRISE RESOURCE

PLANNING AND INTENSIVE GRAPHICS MODELING, TO RUN MUCH FASTER THAN THEY WOULD ON A 32-BIT PROCESSOR. IN OCTOBER 2000, WE HOSTED THE EXCHANGE E-BUSINESS SUMMIT, AT WHICH

MANY OEMS DEMONSTRATED SERVER SYSTEMS BASED ON A PROTOTYPE VERSION OF THE ITANIUM PROCESSOR. MORE THAN 400 APPLICATIONS ARE IN DEVELOPMENT, AND WE HAVE SHIPPED THOUSANDS OF PROTOTYPE SYSTEMS

AND PROCESSORS SINCE NOVEMBER 1999. IN 2000, WE BEGAN TO SHIP PROCESSORS FOR SYSTEMS USED BY INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY END USERS IN PILOT INSTALLATIONS AND WE EXPECT THE RELEASE OF PRODUCTION

SYSTEMS DURING 2001.

MANUFACTURING, ASSEMBLY AND TEST

THE MAJORITY OF OUR WAFER PRODUCTION, INCLUDING MICROPROCESSOR, FLASH MEMORY AND NETWORKING SILICON FABRICATION, IS CONDUCTED WITHIN THE UNITED STATES AT OUR

FACILITIES IN NEW MEXICO, OREGON, ARIZONA, CALIFORNIA AND MASSACHUSETTS. A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR WAFER PRODUCTION, PRIMARILY MICROPROCESSOR AND CHIPSET FABRICATION, IS CONDUCTED OUTSIDE THE

UNITED STATES AT FACILITIES IN ISRAEL AND IRELAND. FOR THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2000, THE ISRAEL AND IRELAND FACILITIES ACCOUNTED FOR APPROXIMATELY 30% OF OUR TOTAL WAFER FABRICATION.

AS

OF YEAR-END 2000, SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR MICROPROCESSORS WERE BUILT USING THE 0.18-MICRON PROCESS TECHNOLOGY. WE ARE MANUFACTURING WAFERS USING THE

0.18-MICRON PROCESS TECHNOLOGY IN ARIZONA, CALIFORNIA, IRELAND, ISRAEL, NEW MEXICO AND OREGON. IN NOVEMBER 2000, WE ANNOUNCED THE COMPLETION OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE

0.13-MICRON (130 NANOMETER) PROCESS TECHNOLOGY. THE 0.13-MICRON PROCESS TECHNOLOGY FEATURES STRUCTURES THAT ARE SMALLER THAN 1/1,000TH THE THICKNESS OF A HUMAN HAIR (0.18

MICRONS IS 1/500TH THE THICKNESS OF A HUMAN HAIR). WE EXPECT TO BEGIN MANUFACTURING OUR FIRST PRODUCT USING 0.13-MICRON PROCESS TECHNOLOGY IN PRODUCTION VOLUMES IN THE SECOND HALF OF 2001,

ENABLING US TO CONTINUE TO DELIVER NEW GENERATIONS OF HIGH-PERFORMANCE MICROPROCESSORS. WE BELIEVE THAT WE WERE THE FIRST COMPANY TO COMPLETE DEVELOPMENT OF THE 0.13-MICRON

PROCESS TECHNOLOGY AND TO DEMONSTRATE MANUFACTURING READINESS WITH COMPLEX INTEGRATED CIRCUITS.

IN

2000, WE ANNOUNCED THAT WE WOULD BEGIN BUILDING HIGH-VOLUME 300MM (12-INCH WAFER) FABRICATION FACILITIES. SOME OF THESE FACILITIES WILL BEGIN PRODUCTION ON

0.13-MICRON PROCESS TECHNOLOGY. THE LARGEST WAFER SIZE WE CURRENTLY USE IN WAFER PRODUCTION IS 200MM (8-INCH WAFER). WE EXPECT THE LARGER 300MM WAFER SIZE TO CUT DIE

MANUFACTURING COSTS BY MORE THAN 30%. WE PLAN TO START PRODUCTION USING 300MM WAFERS IN 2002.

DURING

THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2000, WE PURCHASED A FABRICATION FACILITY IN COLORADO. DURING 2000, WE MADE SUBSTANTIAL RETROFITTING CHANGES AND PROCESS IMPROVEMENTS AT THIS FACILITY,

INCLUDING EQUIPMENT INSTALLATIONS TO MANUFACTURE FLASH MEMORY. WE EXPECT TO BEGIN MANUFACTURING AT THE COLORADO FACILITY IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2001.

WE

ALSO MANUFACTURE MICROPROCESSOR- AND NETWORKING-RELATED BOARD-LEVEL PRODUCTS AND SYSTEMS AT FACILITIES IN MALAYSIA, OREGON AND WASHINGTON. IN ADDITION, WE MANUFACTURE BOARD-LEVEL

PRODUCTS IN PUERTO RICO; HOWEVER, IN JANUARY 2001, WE ANNOUNCED THAT WE WOULD PHASE OUT OUR MANUFACTURING OPERATIONS IN PUERTO RICO DURING THE FIRST HALF OF 2001. BASED ON AN ASSESSMENT ACROSS

OUR WORLDWIDE

BOARD-LEVEL MANUFACTURING FACILITIES, WE CONCLUDED THAT THE OPERATIONS IN PUERTO RICO WERE LESS COST COMPETITIVE THAN OUR OTHER OPERATIONS.

A

SUBSTANTIAL MAJORITY OF OUR COMPONENTS ASSEMBLY AND TESTING, INCLUDING ASSEMBLY AND TESTING FOR MICROPROCESSORS, IS PERFORMED AT FACILITIES IN COSTA RICA, MALAYSIA AND THE

PHILIPPINES. WE ALSO PERFORM COMPONENTS ASSEMBLY AND TESTING AT A FACILITY IN CHINA, AND IN AUGUST 2000 ANNOUNCED PLANS TO EXPAND THIS FACILITY.

TO

AUGMENT CAPACITY IN THE UNITED STATES AS WELL AS INTERNATIONALLY, WE USE SUBCONTRACTORS TO PERFORM ASSEMBLY OF CERTAIN PRODUCTS AND WAFER FABRICATION FOR CERTAIN COMPONENTS,

PRIMARILY FLASH MEMORY, CHIPSETS, AND NETWORKING AND COMMUNICATIONS COMPONENT PRODUCTS. WE ALSO USE SUBCONTRACTORS FOR THE MANUFACTURE OF SOME BOARD-LEVEL PRODUCTS AND SYSTEMS, AND PURCHASE CERTAIN

COMMUNICATION NETWORKING PRODUCTS AND PC PERIPHERALS FROM EXTERNAL VENDORS.

IN

GENERAL, IF WE WERE UNABLE TO MANUFACTURE WAFERS OR TO ASSEMBLE AND TEST OUR PRODUCTS ABROAD, OR IF AIR TRANSPORTATION BETWEEN OUR FOREIGN FACILITIES AND THE UNITED STATES WERE

DISRUPTED, THERE COULD BE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT UPON OUR OPERATIONS. IN ADDITION TO NORMAL MANUFACTURING, ASSEMBLY AND TEST RISKS, OUR OPERATIONS OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES ARE SUBJECT TO CERTAIN

ADDITIONAL EXPOSURES, INCLUDING CURRENCY CONTROLS AND FLUCTUATIONS; TARIFF, IMPORT AND OTHER RESTRICTIONS AND REGULATIONS; AND

10

POLITICAL INSTABILITY, SUCH AS UNREST IN ISRAEL. TO DATE, WE HAVE NOT EXPERIENCED SIGNIFICANT DIFFICULTIES RELATED TO THESE FOREIGN BUSINESS RISKS.

MANUFACTURING

OF INTEGRATED CIRCUITS IS A COMPLEX PROCESS. NORMAL MANUFACTURING RISKS INCLUDE ERRORS AND INTERRUPTIONS IN THE PRODUCTION PROCESS AND DEFECTS IN RAW MATERIALS, AS WELL

AS OTHER RISKS, ALL OF WHICH CAN AFFECT YIELDS. A SUBSTANTIAL DECREASE IN YIELDS WOULD RESULT IN HIGHER MANUFACTURING COSTS AND THE POSSIBILITY OF NOT BEING ABLE TO PRODUCE SUFFICIENT VOLUME TO MEET

SPECIFIC PRODUCT DEMAND.

EMPLOYEES

AS OF DECEMBER 30, 2000, WE EMPLOYED APPROXIMATELY 86,100 PEOPLE WORLDWIDE.

SALES

MOST OF OUR PRODUCTS ARE SOLD OR LICENSED THROUGH SALES OFFICES LOCATED NEAR MAJOR CONCENTRATIONS OF USERS THROUGHOUT NORTH AMERICA, EUROPE,

ASIA-PACIFIC, JAPAN AND OTHER PARTS OF THE WORLD.

WE

ALSO USE INDUSTRIAL AND RETAIL DISTRIBUTORS AND REPRESENTATIVES TO DISTRIBUTE OUR PRODUCTS BOTH WITHIN AND OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES. TYPICALLY, DISTRIBUTORS HANDLE A WIDE VARIETY

OF PRODUCTS, INCLUDING THOSE THAT COMPETE WITH OUR PRODUCTS, AND FILL ORDERS FOR MANY CUSTOMERS. MOST OF OUR SALES TO DISTRIBUTORS ARE MADE UNDER AGREEMENTS ALLOWING FOR PRICE PROTECTION ON UNSOLD

MERCHANDISE AND RIGHT OF RETURN ON STIPULATED QUANTITIES OF UNSOLD MERCHANDISE. SALES REPRESENTATIVES GENERALLY DO NOT OFFER DIRECTLY COMPETITIVE PRODUCTS BUT MAY CARRY COMPLEMENTARY ITEMS

MANUFACTURED BY OTHERS. REPRESENTATIVES DO NOT MAINTAIN A PRODUCT INVENTORY; INSTEAD, THEIR CUSTOMERS PLACE ORDERS DIRECTLY WITH US OR THROUGH DISTRIBUTORS. WE CONDUCTED BUSINESS WITH MORE THAN 2,500

CUSTOMERS WORLDWIDE IN 2000, INCLUDING CUSTOMERS OF OUR ACQUIRED COMPANIES. COMPAQ COMPUTER CORPORATION AND DELL COMPUTER CORPORATION EACH CONTRIBUTED APPROXIMATELY 13% TO OUR TOTAL SALES IN 2000. A

SUBSTANTIAL MAJORITY OF THE SALES TO THESE TWO CUSTOMERS CONSISTED OF INTEL ARCHITECTURE GROUP PRODUCTS. NO OTHER CUSTOMER ACCOUNTED FOR MORE THAN 10% OF OUR TOTAL REVENUES. SALES TO OUR FIVE LARGEST

CUSTOMERS ACCOUNTED FOR APPROXIMATELY 42% OF TOTAL REVENUES. THE INFORMATION REGARDING REVENUES AND OPERATING PROFIT BY REPORTABLE SEGMENTS AND REVENUES FROM UNAFFILIATED CUSTOMERS BY GEOGRAPHIC

REGION UNDER THE HEADING "OPERATING SEGMENT AND GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION" ON PAGE 33 OF OUR 2000 ANNUAL REPORT TO STOCKHOLDERS, IS INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE.

BACKLOG

OUR SALES ARE MADE PRIMARILY PURSUANT TO STANDARD PURCHASE ORDERS FOR DELIVERY OF STANDARD PRODUCTS. WE HAVE SOME AGREEMENTS THAT GIVE A CUSTOMER THE RIGHT TO

PURCHASE A SPECIFIC NUMBER OF PRODUCTS DURING A SPECIFIED TIME PERIOD. ALTHOUGH NOT GENERALLY OBLIGATING THE CUSTOMER TO PURCHASE ANY PARTICULAR NUMBER OF SUCH PRODUCTS, SOME OF THESE AGREEMENTS DO

CONTAIN BILLBACK CLAUSES. UNDER THESE CLAUSES, CUSTOMERS WHO DO NOT PURCHASE THE FULL VOLUME AGREED TO ARE LIABLE FOR BILLBACK ON PREVIOUS SHIPMENTS UP TO THE PRICE APPROPRIATE FOR THE QUANTITY

ACTUALLY PURCHASED. AS A MATTER OF INDUSTRY PRACTICE, BILLBACK CLAUSES ARE DIFFICULT TO ENFORCE. THE QUANTITY ACTUALLY PURCHASED BY THE CUSTOMER, AS WELL AS THE SHIPMENT SCHEDULES, ARE FREQUENTLY

REVISED DURING THE AGREEMENT TERM TO REFLECT CHANGES IN THE CUSTOMER'S NEEDS. IN LIGHT OF INDUSTRY PRACTICE AND EXPERIENCE, WE DO NOT BELIEVE THAT SUCH AGREEMENTS ARE MEANINGFUL FOR DETERMINING

BACKLOG AMOUNTS. WE BELIEVE THAT ONLY A SMALL PORTION OF OUR ORDER BACKLOG IS NONCANCELLABLE AND THAT THE DOLLAR AMOUNT ASSOCIATED WITH THE NONCANCELLABLE PORTION IS NOT MATERIAL. THEREFORE, WE DO NOT

BELIEVE THAT BACKLOG AS OF ANY PARTICULAR DATE IS INDICATIVE OF FUTURE RESULTS.

11

COMPETITION

OUR GOAL IS TO BE THE PREEMINENT BUILDING BLOCK SUPPLIER TO THE WORLDWIDE INTERNET ECONOMY. OUR PRIMARY FOCUS AREAS ARE THE DESKTOP AND MOBILE PLATFORMS, THE

SERVER PLATFORM, AND NETWORKING AND COMMUNICATIONS INCLUDING WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS, AS WELL AS NEW BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES AROUND THE INTERNET. IN EACH OF THESE MARKET SEGMENTS, WE COMPETE, TO

VARIOUS DEGREES, ON THE BASIS OF FUNCTIONALITY, PERFORMANCE, QUALITY, PRICE AND AVAILABILITY. WE ARE ENGAGED IN A RAPIDLY ADVANCING FIELD OF TECHNOLOGY IN WHICH OUR ABILITY TO COMPETE DEPENDS UPON OUR

ABILITY TO IMPROVE OUR PRODUCTS AND PROCESSES, DEVELOP NEW PRODUCTS TO MEET CHANGING CUSTOMER REQUIREMENTS AND REDUCE COSTS. PRICES DECLINE RAPIDLY IN THE SEMICONDUCTOR INDUSTRY AS UNIT VOLUMES GROW,

FURTHER COMPETITION DEVELOPS AND PRODUCTION EXPERIENCE IS ACCUMULATED. MANY COMPANIES COMPETE WITH US IN THE VARIOUS COMPUTING, NETWORKING AND COMMUNICATIONS MARKET SEGMENTS AND ARE ENGAGED IN THE

SAME BASIC FIELDS OF ACTIVITY, INCLUDING RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT. BOTH WITHIN AND OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES, THESE COMPETITORS RANGE IN SIZE FROM LARGE MULTINATIONAL COMPANIES TO SMALLER COMPANIES

COMPETING IN SPECIALIZED MARKET SEGMENTS.

THE

INTEL ARCHITECTURE GROUP OPERATING SEGMENT SUPPORTS THE DESKTOP, MOBILE AND SERVER PLATFORM INITIATIVES. OUR STRATEGY FOR THE DESKTOP, MOBILE AND SERVER PLATFORMS IS TO INTRODUCE

EVER-HIGHER PERFORMANCE MICROPROCESSORS AND CHIPSETS, DEVELOPED FOR DIFFERENT MARKET SEGMENTS OF THE WORLDWIDE COMPUTING MARKET, USING A TIERED BRANDING APPROACH. TO FURTHER ENHANCE THE

ACCEPTANCE AND DEPLOYMENT OF THESE PRODUCTS BY OUR CUSTOMERS, WE ALSO PROVIDE E-BUSINESS ENABLING SOLUTIONS. IN LINE WITH OUR STRATEGY, WE SEEK TO DEVELOP HIGHER PERFORMANCE

MICROPROCESSORS BASED ON THE P6 MICRO-ARCHITECTURE SPECIFICALLY FOR EACH COMPUTING SEGMENT. WE ALSO PLAN TO INTRODUCE HIGHER PERFORMANCE VERSIONS OF PROCESSORS BASED ON THE INTEL NETBURST

MICRO-ARCHITECTURE.

OUR

FINANCIAL RESULTS ARE SUBSTANTIALLY DEPENDENT ON SALES OF MICROPROCESSORS BY THE INTEL ARCHITECTURE GROUP. A NUMBER OF COMPETITORS MARKET SOFTWARE-COMPATIBLE PRODUCTS INTENDED TO

COMPETE WITH INTEL ARCHITECTURE-BASED PROCESSORS. WE ALSO FACE SIGNIFICANT COMPETITION FROM COMPANIES OFFERING RIVAL MICROPROCESSOR ARCHITECTURES. THE CELERON PROCESSOR COMPETES WITH EXISTING AND

FUTURE PRODUCTS IN THE HIGHLY COMPETITIVE VALUE PC MARKET SEGMENT. THE PENTIUM

III

PROCESSOR AND THE PENTIUM 4 PROCESSOR COMPETE WITH EXISTING AND

FUTURE PRODUCTS IN THE PERFORMANCE DESKTOP AND ENTRY-LEVEL WORKSTATION MARKET SEGMENT. COMPETITIVE PRODUCT OFFERINGS IN THE PERFORMANCE DESKTOP MARKET SEGMENT HAVE RECENTLY INCREASED. THE

PENTIUM

III

XEON PROCESSOR COMPETES IN THE MID-RANGE AND HIGH-END SERVER AND WORKSTATION MARKET SEGMENTS WITH ESTABLISHED

PRODUCTS BASED ON RIVAL ARCHITECTURES.

MANY

OF OUR COMPETITORS ARE LICENSED TO USE OUR PATENTS. FURTHERMORE, BASED ON CURRENT CASE LAW, OUR COMPETITORS CAN DESIGN MICROPROCESSORS THAT ARE COMPATIBLE WITH OUR

MICROPROCESSORS AND AVOID OUR PATENT RIGHTS THROUGH THE USE OF FOUNDRY SERVICES THAT HAVE LICENSES WITH US. COMPETITORS' PRODUCTS MAY ADD FEATURES, INCREASE PERFORMANCE OR SELL AT LOWER PRICES. WE

CANNOT PREDICT WHETHER OUR PRODUCTS WILL CONTINUE TO COMPETE SUCCESSFULLY WITH SUCH EXISTING RIVAL ARCHITECTURES OR WHETHER NEW ARCHITECTURES WILL

ESTABLISH OR GAIN MARKET ACCEPTANCE OR PROVIDE INCREASED COMPETITION WITH OUR PRODUCTS. FUTURE DISTORTION OF PRICE MATURITY CURVES COULD OCCUR IF SOFTWARE-COMPATIBLE PRODUCTS ENTER THE MARKET SEGMENT

IN SIGNIFICANT VOLUME OR ALTERNATIVE ARCHITECTURES GAIN MARKET ACCEPTANCE.

WE

PLAN TO CULTIVATE NEW BUSINESSES AS WELL AS CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE COMPUTING INDUSTRY TO EXPAND INTERNET CAPABILITIES AND PRODUCT OFFERINGS, AND DEVELOP COMPELLING SOFTWARE

APPLICATIONS THAT CAN TAKE ADVANTAGE OF HIGHER PERFORMANCE MICROPROCESSORS AND CHIPSETS, INCREASING DEMAND FOR INTEL'S NEWER PRODUCTS IN EACH COMPUTING MARKET SEGMENT. WE MAY CONTINUE TO TAKE VARIOUS

STEPS, INCLUDING REDUCING MICROPROCESSOR PRICES AND OFFERING REBATES AT SUCH TIMES AS WE DEEM APPROPRIATE, IN ORDER TO INCREASE ACCEPTANCE OF OUR LATEST TECHNOLOGY AND TO REMAIN COMPETITIVE WITHIN

EACH RELEVANT MARKET SEGMENT.

12

IN THE NETWORKING AND COMMUNICATIONS INFRASTRUCTURE AREA, OUR STRATEGY IS TO DELIVER BOTH SYSTEM-LEVEL COMMUNICATIONS BUILDING BLOCKS AT VARIOUS LEVELS OF INTEGRATION AND

COMPONENT-LEVEL SILICON BUILDING BLOCKS FOR NETWORKING AND COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEMS. WE HAVE MADE ACQUISITIONS AND EXPECT TO MAKE ADDITIONAL ACQUISITIONS TO GROW THE NETWORKING AND COMMUNICATIONS AREAS.

THE NETWORK COMMUNICATIONS SILICON AND NETWORK CONNECTIVITY PRODUCTS FROM THE NETWORK COMMUNICATIONS GROUP FACE COMPETITION FROM BOTH ESTABLISHED AND EMERGING COMPANIES. THE COMPETITORS IN THESE AREAS

USE AGGRESSIVE PRODUCT AND ACQUISITION PLANS IN EFFORTS TO ACHIEVE LEADING-EDGE MARKET POSITIONS. THE COMMUNICATIONS PRODUCTS GROUP OPERATING SEGMENT SUPPORTS INITIATIVES TO DELIVER THE

SYSTEM-LEVEL COMMUNICATIONS PRODUCTS DIRECTED AT SERVICE PROVIDERS RUNNING E-BUSINESS DATA CENTERS. THE COMMUNICATIONS PRODUCTS GROUP FOCUSES ON SELLING ITS INTEL NETSTRUCTURE PRODUCTS TO

OEM CUSTOMERS. THE COMMUNICATIONS PRODUCTS GROUP ALSO PROVIDES COMPONENT-LEVEL PRODUCTS FOR CONVERGED VOICE AND DATA COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEMS FOR THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS INDUSTRY. THESE PRODUCTS COMPETE

IN THE SMALL AND MID-SIZED ENTERPRISE MARKET SEGMENTS WITH ESTABLISHED PRODUCTS AND LEADING-EDGE INTERNET COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEMS AND SERVER PRODUCTS. WE CANNOT PREDICT WHETHER

OUR NETWORKING AND COMMUNICATIONS PRODUCTS WILL CONTINUE TO COMPETE SUCCESSFULLY WITH PRODUCTS FROM EXISTING COMPETITORS OR PRODUCTS FROM NEW ENTRANTS TO THESE MARKET SEGMENTS.

IN

THE CELLULAR WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS BUSINESS, OUR STRATEGY IS TO DELIVER FEATURE-RICH, ENHANCED FLASH MEMORY PRODUCTS AND HIGH-SPEED PROCESSORS FOR

HANDHELD WIRELESS DEVICES THAT REQUIRE HIGH PERFORMANCE AND LOW POWER. IN SUPPLYING THESE PRODUCTS, OUR WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS AND COMPUTING GROUP FACES COMPETITION FROM ESTABLISHED COMPANIES IN THE

FLASH MEMORY, APPLICATIONS PROCESSOR AND BASEBAND CHIPSET MARKET SEGMENTS.

13

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

OUR COMPETITIVE POSITION HAS DEVELOPED TO A LARGE EXTENT BECAUSE OF OUR EMPHASIS ON RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT. THIS EMPHASIS HAS ENABLED US TO DELIVER

LEADING-EDGE TECHNOLOGY AND HAS PERMITTED OUR CUSTOMERS TO COMMIT TO THE USE OF THESE NEW PRODUCTS IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THEIR OWN PRODUCTS. OUR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES ARE

DIRECTED TOWARD DEVELOPING NEW PRODUCTS, HARDWARE TECHNOLOGIES AND MANUFACTURING PROCESSES, AS WELL AS IMPROVING EXISTING PRODUCTS AND LOWERING COSTS.

A

SUBSTANTIAL MAJORITY OF THE DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT OF COMPONENTS AND OTHER PRODUCTS IS PERFORMED IN THE UNITED STATES AT OUR FACILITIES IN CALIFORNIA, OREGON, ARIZONA AND

WASHINGTON. OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES, WE HAVE PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT FACILITIES AT VARIOUS LOCATIONS, INCLUDING ISRAEL, DENMARK AND MALAYSIA. WE ALSO MAINTAIN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT FACILITIES

DEDICATED TO IMPROVING MANUFACTURING PROCESSES IN ARIZONA, CALIFORNIA AND OREGON.

IN

2000, WE SHIPPED THOUSANDS OF PROTOTYPE PROCESSORS BASED ON THE IA-64 ARCHITECTURE FOR HIGH-END SERVERS, UNDER THE ITANIUM BRAND, AND BEGAN TO SHIP

PROCESSORS FOR SYSTEMS USED BY INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY END USERS IN PILOT INSTALLATIONS. WE EXPECT THE RELEASE OF PRODUCTION SYSTEMS DURING 2001. THE ITANIUM PROCESSOR IS BUILT ON THE

0.18-MICRON PROCESS TECHNOLOGY. DURING 2000, APPROXIMATELY HALF OF OUR MICROPROCESSOR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT BUDGET WAS SPENT ON INITIATIVES RELATED TO THE SERVER AND WORKSTATION MARKET

SEGMENT.

IN

ADDITION TO MICROPROCESSOR AND CHIPSET RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, WE HAVE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT INITIATIVES IN WIRELESS DEVICES, NETWORKING AND COMMUNICATIONS PRODUCTS, CONNECTED

PERIPHERALS AND OTHER AREAS. THESE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT INITIATIVES INCLUDE PROJECTS SURROUNDING THE INTEL XSCALE MICRO-ARCHITECTURE FOR WIRELESS DEVICES AND THE INTEL IXA ARCHITECTURE FOR

NETWORKING AND COMMUNICATIONS PRODUCTS. WE HAVE ALSO ACQUIRED ONGOING RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES IN THESE AREAS WITH BUSINESSES ACQUIRED IN 2000.

OUR

EXPENDITURES FOR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT WERE $3,897 MILLION IN FISCAL YEAR 2000, $3,111 MILLION IN FISCAL YEAR 1999 AND $2,509 MILLION IN FISCAL YEAR 1998.

THESE AMOUNTS EXCLUDE CHARGES FOR PURCHASED IN-PROCESS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT RELATED TO ACQUISITIONS OF $109 MILLION FOR FISCAL YEAR 2000, $392 MILLION FOR FISCAL YEAR

1999 AND $165 MILLION FOR FISCAL YEAR 1998. AT DECEMBER 2000, WE HAD APPROXIMATELY 20,500 EMPLOYEES ENGAGED IN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT. THE SUCCESS OF OUR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

ACTIVITIES IS DEPENDENT UPON COMPETITIVE CIRCUMSTANCES AS WELL AS OUR ABILITY TO BRING NEW

PRODUCTS TO MARKET IN EACH COMPUTING MARKET SEGMENT AND IN OUR OTHER BUSINESSES IN A TIMELY AND COST-EFFECTIVE MANNER.

ACQUISITIONS AND STRATEGIC INVESTMENTS

DURING 2000, WE ACQUIRED 16 BUSINESSES FOR MORE THAN $2.7 BILLION, AUGMENTING OUR CAPABILITIES IN A NUMBER OF STRATEGIC AREAS. THE COMPANIES ACQUIRED

INCLUDED AMBIENT, GIGA, PICAZO, BASIS, TRILLIUM AND ZIATECH. THESE ACQUISITIONS ARE DISCUSSED UNDER THE "PRODUCTS" HEADING IN PART I, ITEM 1 OF THIS FORM 10-K IN CONNECTION

WITH EACH RELATED BUSINESS GROUP.

UNDER

OUR INTEL CAPITAL PROGRAM, WE ALSO MAKE EQUITY INVESTMENTS TO FURTHER OUR STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES AND TO SUPPORT OUR KEY BUSINESS INITIATIVES IN THE AREAS OF DESKTOP AND MOBILE

PLATFORMS, SERVER PLATFORMS, NETWORKING AND COMMUNICATIONS, AND INTERNET SERVICES. WE WANT TO STIMULATE GROWTH IN COMPUTING, COMMUNICATIONS AND THE INTERNET, AND TO GROW THE TOTAL INFORMATION

INFRASTRUCTURE, IN ORDER TO CREATE AND EXPAND MARKETS FOR OUR PRODUCTS. THIS STRATEGIC INVESTMENT PROGRAM HELPS ADVANCE OUR OVERALL MISSION OF BEING A LEADING PROVIDER OF KEY BUILDING BLOCKS TO THE

INTERNET ECONOMY. WHILE FINANCIAL RETURNS ARE NOT OUR PRIMARY GOAL, OUR STRATEGIC INVESTMENT PROGRAM SEEKS TO INVEST IN COMPANIES THAT CAN SUCCEED AND HAVE AN IMPACT ON THEIR MARKET SEGMENT. WHEN THE

STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES OF AN INVESTMENT HAVE BEEN ACHIEVED, OR IF THE INVESTMENT DIVERGES FROM OUR STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES, WE MAY DECIDE TO DISPOSE OF THE INVESTMENT. AS OF YEAR-END 2000, OUR

STRATEGIC EQUITY PORTFOLIO WAS VALUED

14

AT APPROXIMATELY $3.7 BILLION, INCLUDING MARKETABLE INVESTMENTS AT THEIR MARKET VALUE AND NON-MARKETABLE INVESTMENTS AT COST.

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND LICENSING

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS THAT APPLY TO OUR VARIOUS PRODUCTS INCLUDE PATENTS, COPYRIGHTS, TRADE SECRETS, TRADEMARKS AND MASKWORK RIGHTS. INTEL HAS

ESTABLISHED AN ACTIVE PROGRAM TO PROTECT ITS INVESTMENT IN TECHNOLOGY BY ENFORCING ITS INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS. WE DO NOT INTEND TO LICENSE OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS BROADLY UNLESS WE CAN

OBTAIN ADEQUATE CONSIDERATION. WE ALSO REFER TO INFORMATION APPEARING UNDER THE HEADING "COMPETITION" IN PART I, ITEM 1 OF THIS FORM 10-K.

WE

HAVE FILED AND OBTAINED A NUMBER OF PATENTS IN THE UNITED STATES AND ABROAD, AND WE HAVE ENTERED INTO PATENT CROSS-LICENSE AGREEMENTS WITH MANY OF OUR MAJOR COMPETITORS AND OTHER

PARTIES. WHILE OUR

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS ARE IMPORTANT TO OUR SUCCESS, OUR BUSINESS AS A WHOLE IS NOT MATERIALLY DEPENDENT UPON ANY PARTICULAR PATENT OR LICENSE. WE AND OTHER COMPANIES IN THE COMPUTER,

TELECOMMUNICATIONS AND RELATED HIGH-TECHNOLOGY FIELDS TYPICALLY APPLY FOR AND RECEIVE, IN THE AGGREGATE, THOUSANDS OF PATENTS ANNUALLY IN THE UNITED STATES AND OTHER COUNTRIES. IN

ADDITION, BECAUSE OF THE FAST PACE OF INNOVATION AND PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT, OUR PRODUCTS ARE OFTEN OBSOLETE BEFORE THE PATENTS RELATED TO THEM EXPIRE. AS A RESULT, WE BELIEVE THAT THE DURATION OF THE

APPLICABLE PATENTS IS ADEQUATE RELATIVE TO THE EXPECTED LIVES OF OUR PRODUCTS.

WE

PROTECT MANY OF OUR COMPUTER PROGRAMS BY COPYRIGHTING THEM. WE HAVE REGISTERED NUMEROUS COPYRIGHTS WITH THE UNITED STATES COPYRIGHT OFFICE. THE ABILITY TO PROTECT OR COPYRIGHT

SOFTWARE IN SOME FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS IS NOT CLEAR. HOWEVER, IT IS OUR POLICY TO REQUIRE CUSTOMERS TO OBTAIN A SOFTWARE LICENSE CONTRACT BEFORE WE PROVIDE THEM WITH CERTAIN COMPUTER PROGRAMS. CERTAIN

COMPONENTS CONTAIN EMBEDDED COMPUTER PROGRAMS, AND WE HAVE ALSO OBTAINED COPYRIGHT PROTECTION FOR SOME OF THESE PROGRAMS. IN ADDITION, WE HAVE OBTAINED PROTECTION FOR THE MASKWORKS FOR A NUMBER OF OUR

COMPONENTS UNDER THE CHIP PROTECTION ACT OF 1984.

WE

HAVE OBTAINED CERTAIN TRADEMARKS AND TRADE NAMES FOR OUR PRODUCTS TO DISTINGUISH GENUINE INTEL PRODUCTS FROM OUR COMPETITORS' PRODUCTS, AND WE ARE CURRENTLY ENGAGED IN A

COOPERATIVE PROGRAM WITH OEMS TO IDENTIFY WITH THE INTEL INSIDE® LOGO CERTAIN PERSONAL COMPUTERS CONTAINING GENUINE INTEL MICROPROCESSORS. WE MAINTAIN CERTAIN DETAILS ABOUT OUR

PROCESSES, PRODUCTS AND STRATEGIES AS TRADE SECRETS.

LIKE

MANY COMPANIES IN THE SEMICONDUCTOR AND OTHER HIGH-TECHNOLOGY INDUSTRIES, WE HAVE FROM TIME TO TIME BEEN NOTIFIED OF CLAIMS THAT WE MAY BE INFRINGING CERTAIN

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS OF OTHERS. THESE CLAIMS HAVE BEEN REFERRED TO COUNSEL, AND THEY ARE IN VARIOUS STAGES OF EVALUATION AND NEGOTIATION. IF IT APPEARS NECESSARY OR DESIRABLE, WE MAY SEEK

LICENSES FOR THESE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS. WE CAN GIVE NO ASSURANCE THAT LICENSES WILL BE OFFERED BY ALL CLAIMANTS, THAT THE TERMS OF ANY OFFERED LICENSES WILL BE ACCEPTABLE TO US OR THAT IN ALL

CASES THE DISPUTE WILL BE RESOLVED WITHOUT LITIGATION, WHICH MAY BE TIME CONSUMING AND EXPENSIVE, AND MAY RESULT IN INJUNCTIVE RELIEF OR THE PAYMENT OF DAMAGES BY US. WE ALSO REFER TO THE INFORMATION

APPEARING UNDER THE HEADING "LEGAL PROCEEDINGS" IN PART I, ITEM 3 OF THIS FORM 10-K.

COMPLIANCE WITH ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS

TO OUR PRESENT KNOWLEDGE, COMPLIANCE WITH FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL PROVISIONS ENACTED OR ADOPTED FOR PROTECTION OF THE ENVIRONMENT HAS HAD NO MATERIAL EFFECT

UPON OUR OPERATIONS. REFERENCE IS MADE TO THE INFORMATION APPEARING UNDER THE HEADING "LEGAL PROCEEDINGS" IN PART I, ITEM 3 OF THIS FORM 10-K.

ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

A. LITIGATION

INTERGRAPH

CORPORATION V. INTEL

U.S. DISTRICT COURT, NORTHERN DISTRICT OF ALABAMA, NORTHEASTERN DIVISION (CV-97-N-3023-NE)

IN

NOVEMBER 1997, INTERGRAPH CORPORATION FILED SUIT IN FEDERAL DISTRICT COURT IN ALABAMA, GENERALLY ALLEGING THAT INTEL ATTEMPTED TO COERCE INTERGRAPH INTO RELINQUISHING CERTAIN PATENT RIGHTS.

THE SUIT ALLEGES THAT INTEL INFRINGES FIVE INTERGRAPH MICROPROCESSOR-RELATED PATENTS AND INCLUDES ALLEGED VIOLATIONS OF ANTITRUST LAWS AND VARIOUS STATE LAW CLAIMS. THE SUIT SEEKS INJUNCTIVE RELIEF,

DAMAGES AND PREJUDGMENT INTEREST, AND FURTHER ALLEGES THAT INTEL'S INFRINGEMENT IS WILLFUL AND THAT ANY DAMAGES AWARDED SHOULD BE TREBLED. INTERGRAPH'S EXPERT WITNESS HAS CLAIMED THAT INTERGRAPH IS

ENTITLED TO DAMAGES OF APPROXIMATELY $2.2 BILLION FOR INTEL'S ALLEGED PATENT INFRINGEMENT, $500 MILLION FOR THE ALLEGED ANTITRUST VIOLATIONS AND AN UNDETERMINED AMOUNT FOR ALLEGED STATE

LAW VIOLATIONS. INTEL BELIEVES THAT IT DOES NOT INFRINGE INTERGRAPH'S PATENTS AND BELIEVES THOSE PATENTS ARE INVALID AND UNENFORCEABLE. INTEL HAS COUNTERCLAIMED THAT THE INTERGRAPH PATENTS ARE INVALID

AND FURTHER ALLEGES INFRINGEMENT OF SEVEN INTEL PATENTS, BREACH OF CONTRACT AND MISAPPROPRIATION OF TRADE SECRETS. IN OCTOBER 1999, THE COURT RECONSIDERED AN EARLIER ADVERSE RULING AND GRANTED

INTEL'S MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT THAT THE INTERGRAPH PATENTS ARE LICENSED TO INTEL, AND DISMISSED ALL OF INTERGRAPH'S PATENT INFRINGEMENT CLAIMS WITH PREJUDICE. THIS RULING HAS BEEN REVERSED BY THE

COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE FEDERAL CIRCUIT, AND AS A RESULT, THE PATENT ISSUES ARE RETURNED TO THE DISTRICT COURT. IN MARCH 2000, THE DISTRICT COURT GRANTED INTEL'S MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT ON

INTERGRAPH'S FEDERAL ANTITRUST CLAIMS, AND IN APRIL 2000, INTERGRAPH APPEALED THIS RULING. INTERGRAPH'S STATE LAW CLAIMS REMAIN AT ISSUE IN THE TRIAL COURT. THE COMPANY DISPUTES INTERGRAPH'S

CLAIMS AND INTENDS TO DEFEND THE LAWSUIT VIGOROUSLY.

B. ENVIRONMENTAL PROCEEDINGS

WE

HAVE BEEN NAMED TO THE CALIFORNIA AND U.S. SUPERFUND LISTS FOR THREE OF OUR SITES AND HAVE COMPLETED, ALONG WITH TWO OTHER COMPANIES, A REMEDIAL INVESTIGATION/FEASIBILITY STUDY WITH THE U.S.

ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY (EPA) TO EVALUATE THE GROUNDWATER IN AREAS ADJACENT TO ONE OF OUR FORMER SITES. THE EPA HAS ISSUED A RECORD OF DECISION WITH RESPECT TO A GROUNDWATER CLEANUP PLAN AT

THAT SITE, INCLUDING EXPECTED COSTS TO COMPLETE. UNDER THE CALIFORNIA AND U.S. SUPERFUND STATUTES, LIABILITY FOR CLEANUP OF THIS SITE AND THE ADJACENT AREA IS JOINT AND SEVERAL. WE, HOWEVER, HAVE

REACHED AGREEMENT WITH THOSE SAME TWO COMPANIES THAT SIGNIFICANTLY LIMITS OUR LIABILITIES UNDER THE PROPOSED CLEANUP PLAN. ALSO, WE HAVE COMPLETED EXTENSIVE STUDIES AT OUR OTHER SITES AND ARE ENGAGED

IN CLEANUP AT SEVERAL OF THESE SITES. IN THE OPINION OF MANAGEMENT, INCLUDING INTERNAL COUNSEL, THE POTENTIAL LOSSES TO US IN EXCESS OF AMOUNTS ALREADY ACCRUED ARISING OUT OF THESE MATTERS WOULD NOT

HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL POSITION OR OVERALL TRENDS IN RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, EVEN IF JOINT AND SEVERAL LIABILITY WERE TO BE ASSESSED.

WE

ARE CURRENTLY PARTY TO VARIOUS LEGAL PROCEEDINGS, INCLUDING THOSE NOTED ABOVE. WHILE MANAGEMENT, INCLUDING INTERNAL COUNSEL, CURRENTLY BELIEVES THAT THE ULTIMATE OUTCOME OF THESE

PROCEEDINGS, INDIVIDUALLY AND IN THE AGGREGATE, WILL NOT HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL POSITION OR OVERALL TRENDS IN RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, LITIGATION IS SUBJECT TO INHERENT

UNCERTAINTIES. WERE AN UNFAVORABLE RULING TO OCCUR, THERE EXISTS THE POSSIBILITY OF A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON THE NET INCOME OF THE PERIOD IN WHICH THE RULING OCCURS. THE ESTIMATE OF THE POTENTIAL

IMPACT ON OUR FINANCIAL POSITION OR OVERALL RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE ABOVE LEGAL PROCEEDINGS COULD CHANGE IN THE FUTURE.

TRANSACTION WAS MADE, WITHOUT GENERAL SOLICITATION OR ADVERTISING, PURSUANT TO THE EXEMPTION FROM REGISTRATION PROVIDED BY SECTION 4(2) OF THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT
