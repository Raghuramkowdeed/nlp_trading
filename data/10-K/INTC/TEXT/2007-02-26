TABLE OF CONTENTS

A

MICROPROCESSOR

IS THE CENTRAL PROCESSING UNIT (CPU) OF

A COMPUTER SYSTEM. IT PROCESSES SYSTEM DATA AND CONTROLS OTHER

DEVICES IN THE SYSTEM, ACTING AS THE BRAINS OF THE

COMPUTER. THE FOLLOWING ASPECTS OF MICROPROCESSOR DESIGN IMPACT

OVERALL PLATFORM PERFORMANCE.



MULTI-CORE PROCESSORS.

MULTI-CORE PROCESSORS CONTAIN

TWO OR MORE PROCESSOR CORES, WHICH ENABLE IMPROVED MULTITASKING

AND ENERGY-EFFICIENT PERFORMANCE. OUR DUAL-CORE MICROPROCESSORS

MICROARCHITECTURE DESIGN OF THE CPU.

MICROPROCESSOR

DESIGN ARCHITECTURES ARE COMMONLY CATEGORIZED BY THE NUMBER OF

BITS (THE SMALLEST UNIT OF INFORMATION PROCESSED ON A COMPUTER)

THAT THE PROCESSOR CAN HANDLE AT ONE TIME. CURRENTLY,

MICROPROCESSORS ARE DESIGNED TO PROCESS 32 BITS OR 64 BITS OF

INFORMATION AT ONE TIME. MICROPROCESSORS WITH 64-BIT PROCESSING

CAPABILITY CAN ADDRESS SIGNIFICANTLY MORE MEMORY THAN 32-BIT

MICROPROCESSORS. THE

INTEL

®

CORE

TM

,

INTEL

®

PENTIUM

®

,

INTEL

®

CELERON

®

,

AND

INTEL

®

XEON

®

BRANDED PRODUCTS ARE BASED ON OUR 32-BIT ARCHITECTURE (IA-32),

WHILE

INTEL

®

ITANIUM

®

BRANDED PRODUCTS ARE BASED ON OUR

64-BIT

ARCHITECTURE

(IA-64).

ANOTHER WAY TO PROVIDE

64-BIT

PROCESSING CAPABILITY IS FOR PROCESSORS BASED ON

32-BIT

ARCHITECTURE TO HAVE 64-BIT ADDRESS EXTENSIONS. THE MAJORITY OF

OUR MICROPROCESSORS ARE EQUIPPED WITH

INTEL

®

64 ARCHITECTURE, WHICH PROVIDES 64-BIT ADDRESS EXTENSIONS,

SUPPORTING BOTH 32-BIT AND 64-BIT SOFTWARE APPLICATIONS.



CLOCK SPEED.

CLOCK SPEED IS THE RATE AT WHICH A

MICROPROCESSORS INTERNAL LOGIC OPERATES AND IS A MEASURE

OF A MICROPROCESSORS PERFORMANCE. CLOCK SPEED IS MEASURED

IN UNITS OF HERTZ, OR CYCLES PROCESSED PER SECOND. ONE MEGAHERTZ

(MHZ) EQUALS ONE MILLION CYCLES PROCESSED PER SECOND, AND ONE

GIGAHERTZ (GHZ) EQUALS ONE BILLION CYCLES PROCESSED PER SECOND.



SPEED OF MEMORY ACCESS.

CACHE IS A MEMORY THAT CAN

BE LOCATED DIRECTLY ON THE MICROPROCESSOR, PERMITTING QUICKER

ACCESS TO FREQUENTLY USED DATA AND INSTRUCTIONS. SOME OF OUR

MICROPROCESSORS HAVE ADDITIONAL LEVELS OF

CACHESECOND-LEVEL (L2) CACHE AND THIRD-LEVEL (L3)

CACHETO ENABLE HIGHER LEVELS OF PERFORMANCE.



SPEED OF COMMUNICATION BETWEEN THE CPU AND THE

CHIPSET.

A BUS CARRIES DATA BETWEEN PARTS OF THE

SYSTEM. A FASTER BUS ALLOWS FOR FASTER DATA TRANSFER INTO AND

OUT OF THE PROCESSOR, ENABLING INCREASED PERFORMANCE.



AMOUNT AND TYPE OF MEMORY STORAGE.

MEMORY STORAGE IS

MEASURED IN BYTES (8 BITS), WITH 1,024 BYTES EQUALING A KILOBYTE

(KB), 1.049 MILLION BYTES EQUALING A MEGABYTE (MB), AND 1.074

BILLION BYTES EQUALING A GIGABYTE (GB).

IN ADDITION TO THE PERFORMANCE FACTORS DISCUSSED ABOVE, OUR

INTEL

®

CORE

TM

MICROARCHITECTURE PROVIDES OTHER ENHANCED FEATURES THAT CAN

INCREASE PERFORMANCE OR ENERGY EFFICIENCY, INCLUDING THE

FOLLOWING.

FEATURE

PERFORMANCE ENHANCEMENT

INTEL

®

ADVANCED SMART CACHE

ALLOWS ONE CORE TO UTILIZE THE

ENTIRE CACHE

INTEL

®

INTELLIGENT POWER CAPABILITY

OPTIMIZES ENERGY BY MANAGING THE

RUNTIME POWER CONSUMPTION OF EACH CORE

INTEL

®

WIDE DYNAMIC EXECUTION

ENABLES EACH CORE TO COMPLETE UP

TO FOUR FULL INSTRUCTIONS SIMULTANEOUSLY

INTEL

®

SMART MEMORY ACCESS

OPTIMIZES THE USE OF AVAILABLE

DATA BANDWIDTH FROM THE MEMORY SUBSYSTEM AND HIDES MEMORY LATENCY

INTEL

®

ADVANCED DIGITAL MEDIA BOOST

INCREASES THE EXECUTION SPEED FOR

INSTRUCTIONS USED WIDELY IN MULTIMEDIA AND GRAPHICS APPLICATIONS

OTHER MICROPROCESSOR CAPABILITIES CAN ALSO ENHANCE SYSTEM

PERFORMANCE OR USER EXPERIENCE. FOR EXAMPLE, WE OFFER

MICROPROCESSORS WITH INTELS HT TECHNOLOGY, WHICH ALLOWS

EACH PROCESSOR CORE TO PROCESS TWO THREADS OF INSTRUCTIONS

SIMULTANEOUSLY. THIS CAPABILITY CAN PROVIDE BENEFITS IN ONE OF

TWO WAYS: IT HELPS TO RUN MULTITHREADED SOFTWARE,

WHICH IS DESIGNED TO EXECUTE DIFFERENT PARTS OF A PROGRAM

SIMULTANEOUSLY, OR IT HELPS TO RUN MULTIPLE SOFTWARE PROGRAMS

SIMULTANEOUSLY IN A MULTITASKING ENVIRONMENT. OTHER TECHNOLOGIES

INCLUDE INTEL AMT, WHICH HELPS INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY MANAGERS

DIAGNOSE, FIX, AND PROTECT ENABLED SYSTEMS THAT ARE PLUGGED IN

AND CONNECTED TO A NETWORK, EVEN IF A COMPUTER IS TURNED OFF OR

HAS A FAILED HARD DRIVE OR OPERATING SYSTEM; AND INTEL VT, WHICH

PROVIDES INCREASED SECURITY AND MANAGEMENT CAPABILITIES THROUGH

THE USE OF VIRTUAL PARTITIONS THAT ISOLATE USER ENVIRONMENTS,

FOR EXAMPLE, BY ENABLING A PLATFORM TO RUN MULTIPLE OPERATING

SYSTEMS AND ALLOWING FOR THE SYSTEM TO ISOLATE VIRUSES FROM

APPLICATIONS WITHIN OTHER PARTITIONS. TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THESE

FEATURES, A COMPUTER SYSTEM MUST HAVE A MICROPROCESSOR THAT

SUPPORTS: A CHIPSET AND BIOS (BASIC INPUT/OUTPUT SYSTEM) THAT

USE, AND SOFTWARE THAT IS OPTIMIZED FOR, THE TECHNOLOGY.

PERFORMANCE ALSO WILL VARY DEPENDING ON THE SYSTEM HARDWARE AND

SOFTWARE USED.

MICROPROCESSORS ARE ALSO USED IN EMBEDDED DESIGNS SUCH AS

INDUSTRIAL EQUIPMENT,

POINT-OF-SALE

SYSTEMS, PANEL PCS, AUTOMOTIVE INFORMATION/ENTERTAINMENT

SYSTEMS, AND MEDICAL EQUIPMENT.

2

TABLE OF CONTENTS

OUR MICROPROCESSOR SALES GENERALLY HAVE FOLLOWED A SEASONAL

TREND; HOWEVER, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THIS TREND WILL

CONTINUE. HISTORICALLY, OUR SALES OF MICROPROCESSORS HAVE BEEN

HIGHER IN THE SECOND HALF OF THE YEAR THAN IN THE FIRST HALF OF

THE YEAR. CONSUMER PURCHASES OF PCS HAVE BEEN HIGHER IN THE

SECOND HALF OF THE YEAR, PRIMARILY DUE TO

BACK-TO-SCHOOL

AND HOLIDAY DEMAND. IN ADDITION, PURCHASES FROM BUSINESSES HAVE

TENDED TO BE HIGHER IN THE SECOND HALF OF THE YEAR.

THE

CHIPSET

OPERATES AS THE PCS NERVOUS

SYSTEM, SENDING DATA BETWEEN THE MICROPROCESSOR AND INPUT,

DISPLAY, AND STORAGE DEVICES, SUCH AS THE KEYBOARD, MOUSE,

MONITOR, HARD DRIVE, AND CD OR DVD DRIVE. CHIPSETS PERFORM

ESSENTIAL LOGIC FUNCTIONS, SUCH AS BALANCING THE PERFORMANCE OF

THE SYSTEM AND REMOVING BOTTLENECKS. CHIPSETS ALSO EXTEND THE

GRAPHICS, AUDIO, VIDEO, AND OTHER CAPABILITIES OF MANY SYSTEMS

BASED ON OUR MICROPROCESSORS. FINALLY, CHIPSETS CONTROL THE

ACCESS BETWEEN THE CPU AND MAIN MEMORY. WE OFFER CHIPSETS

COMPATIBLE WITH A VARIETY OF INDUSTRY-ACCEPTED BUS

SPECIFICATIONS, SUCH AS THE ACCELERATED GRAPHICS PORT (AGP)

SPECIFICATION, THE PERIPHERAL COMPONENTS INTERCONNECT (PCI)

LOCAL BUS SPECIFICATION, AND THE PCI EXPRESS* LOCAL BUS

SPECIFICATION. PCI EXPRESS SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASES THE DATA

TRANSFER RATE OF THE ORIGINAL PCI SPECIFICATION, THEREBY

IMPROVING THE GRAPHICS AND INPUT/OUTPUT BANDWIDTH AND ENABLING

AN IMPROVED MULTIMEDIA EXPERIENCE. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR CUSTOMERS

ALSO WANT MEMORY ARCHITECTURE ALTERNATIVES, AND AS A RESULT, WE

OFFER CHIPSETS SUPPORTING DOUBLE DATA RATE (DDR) AND DDR2

(SECOND-GENERATION, FASTER DDR MEMORY), DYNAMIC RANDOM ACCESS

MEMORY (DRAM), SYNCHRONOUS DRAM (SDRAM), AND FULLY BUFFERED DUAL

IN-LINE MEMORY MODULE (FB-DIMM).

A

MOTHERBOARD

IS THE PRINCIPAL BOARD WITHIN A SYSTEM. A

MOTHERBOARD HAS CONNECTORS FOR ATTACHING DEVICES TO THE BUS, AND

TYPICALLY CONTAINS THE CPU, MEMORY, AND THE CHIPSET. WE

CURRENTLY OFFER MOTHERBOARD PRODUCTS DESIGNED FOR OUR DESKTOP,

SERVER, AND WORKSTATION PLATFORMS, THEREBY PROVIDING A MORE

COMPLETE RANGE OF SOLUTIONS FOR OUR CUSTOMERS LOOKING FOR

INTEL

®

-BASED

SOLUTIONS. WE PROVIDE OUR OEM CUSTOMERS WITH THE FLEXIBILITY TO

MAKE PURCHASES AT THE BOARD OR AT THE COMPONENT LEVEL.

FLASH MEMORY

IS A SPECIALIZED TYPE OF MEMORY COMPONENT

USED TO STORE USER DATA AND PROGRAM CODE; IT RETAINS THIS

INFORMATION EVEN WHEN THE POWER IS OFF, AND PROVIDES FASTER

ACCESS TO DATA THAN TRADITIONAL HARD DRIVES. FLASH MEMORY HAS NO

MOVING PARTS, UNLIKE DEVICES SUCH AS RAPIDLY SPINNING HARD

DRIVES, ALLOWING FLASH MEMORY TO BE MORE TOLERANT OF BUMPS AND

SHOCKS. A COMMON MEASURE OF FLASH MEMORY PERFORMANCE IS THE

DENSITY OF THE PRODUCT. DENSITY REFERS TO THE AMOUNT OF

INFORMATION THE PRODUCT IS CAPABLE OF STORING. FLASH MEMORY IS

BASED ON EITHER NOR OR NAND ARCHITECTURE. NOR FLASH MEMORY, WITH

ITS FAST ACCESS OR READ CAPABILITIES, HAS

TRADITIONALLY BEEN USED TO STORE EXECUTABLE CODE. WE OFFER NOR

FLASH MEMORY PRODUCTS SUCH AS INTEL

STRATAFLASH

®

WIRELESS MEMORY FOR MOBILE PHONE DESIGNS. IN ADDITION TO PRODUCT

OFFERINGS FOR CELLULAR CUSTOMERS, WE OFFER NOR FLASH MEMORY

PRODUCTS THAT MEET THE NEEDS OF OTHER MARKET SEGMENTS, SUCH AS

THE EMBEDDED MARKET SEGMENT. THE EMBEDDED MARKET SEGMENT

INCLUDES SET-TOP BOXES, NETWORKING PRODUCTS, DVD PLAYERS, DSL

AND CABLE MODEMS, AND OTHER DEVICES. NAND FLASH MEMORY IS SLOWER

IN READING DATA BUT FASTER IN WRITING DATA. WE OFFER NAND FLASH

MEMORY PRODUCTS THAT ARE DESIGNED PRIMARILY FOR MEMORY CARDS,

DIGITAL AUDIO PLAYERS, AND CELLULAR PHONES. OUR NAND FLASH

MEMORY PRODUCTS ARE MANUFACTURED BY IM FLASH TECHNOLOGIES, LLC

(IMFT), A COMPANY WE FORMED WITH MICRON TECHNOLOGY, INC. IN

JANUARY 2006. FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION OF OUR EQUITY INVESTMENT IN

IMFT, SEE NOTE 17: VENTURE IN PART II, ITEM 8 OF

THIS FORM

WE EXPECT TO INCREASE THE CAPACITY OF CERTAIN FACILITIES LISTED

ABOVE THROUGH ADDITIONAL INVESTMENTS IN CAPITAL EQUIPMENT. IN

ADDITION TO OUR CURRENT FACILITIES, WE ARE BUILDING FACILITIES

IN ARIZONA AND ISRAEL THAT, IN 2007 AND 2008 RESPECTIVELY, ARE

EXPECTED TO BEGIN WAFER FABRICATION FOR MICROPROCESSORS ON 300MM

WAFERS USING 45-NANOMETER TECHNOLOGY.

AS OF YEAR-END 2006, THE MAJORITY OF OUR MICROPROCESSORS WERE

MANUFACTURED ON 300MM WAFERS USING OUR 65-NANOMETER PROCESS

TECHNOLOGY. IN 2007, WE EXPECT TO BEGIN MANUFACTURING

MICROPROCESSORS ON OUR 45-NANOMETER PROCESS TECHNOLOGY, THE NEXT

GENERATION OF ADVANCED HIGH-VOLUME PRODUCTION PROCESS TECHNOLOGY

BEYOND OUR 65-NANOMETER PROCESS TECHNOLOGY. AS WE MOVE TO EACH

SUCCEEDING GENERATION OF MANUFACTURING PROCESS TECHNOLOGY, WE

INCUR SIGNIFICANT

START-UP

COSTS TO PREPARE EACH FACTORY FOR MANUFACTURING. HOWEVER,

CONTINUING TO ADVANCE OUR PROCESS TECHNOLOGY PROVIDES BENEFITS

THAT WE BELIEVE JUSTIFY THESE COSTS. THESE BENEFITS CAN INCLUDE

UTILIZING LESS SPACE PER TRANSISTOR, WHICH DECREASES THE SIZE OF

THE CHIP

AND/OR

ENABLES US TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF INTEGRATED FEATURES ON EACH

CHIP; REDUCING HEAT OUTPUT FROM EACH TRANSISTOR; AND IMPROVING

POWER EFFICIENCY. THESE ADVANCEMENTS CAN RESULT IN HIGHER

PERFORMING MICROPROCESSORS, PRODUCTS THAT CONSUME LESS POWER,

AND/OR

PRODUCTS THAT COST LESS TO MANUFACTURE. TO AUGMENT CAPACITY IN

THE U.S. AND INTERNATIONALLY, WE USE THIRD-PARTY MANUFACTURING

COMPANIES (FOUNDRIES) TO MANUFACTURE WAFERS FOR CERTAIN

COMPONENTS, INCLUDING CHIPSET, NETWORKING, AND COMMUNICATIONS

PRODUCTS.

OUR NAND FLASH MEMORY PRODUCTS ARE MANUFACTURED BY IMFT, A NAND

FLASH MEMORY MANUFACTURING COMPANY THAT WE FORMED WITH MICRON.

WE CURRENTLY PURCHASE 49% OF THE MANUFACTURED OUTPUT OF IMFT.

SEE NOTE 17: VENTURE IN PART II, ITEM 8 OF THIS FORM

TABLE OF CONTENTS

FOLLOWING THE MANUFACTURING PROCESS, THE MAJORITY OF OUR

COMPONENTS ARE SUBJECT TO ASSEMBLY AND TEST. WE PERFORM A

SUBSTANTIAL MAJORITY OF OUR COMPONENTS ASSEMBLY AND TEST AT

FACILITIES IN MALAYSIA, THE PHILIPPINES, CHINA, AND COSTA RICA.

WE PLAN TO CONTINUE INVESTING IN NEW ASSEMBLY AND TEST

TECHNOLOGIES AS WELL AS INCREASING THE CAPACITY OF OUR EXISTING

FACILITIES AND BUILDING NEW FACILITIES TO KEEP PACE WITH OUR

MICROPROCESSOR, CHIPSET, FLASH MEMORY, AND COMMUNICATIONS

TECHNOLOGY IMPROVEMENTS. IN LINE WITH THESE PLANS, WE PLAN TO

BUILD A NEW ASSEMBLY AND TEST FACILITY IN VIETNAM, WHICH IS

EXPECTED TO BEGIN PRODUCTION IN 2009. THIS FACILITY WILL HAVE

GREATER SQUARE FOOTAGE THAN OUR CURRENT FACILITIES, WHICH WILL

ENABLE US TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF GREATER EFFICIENCIES OF SCALE. TO

AUGMENT CAPACITY, WE USE SUBCONTRACTORS TO PERFORM ASSEMBLY OF

CERTAIN PRODUCTS, PRIMARILY FLASH MEMORY, CHIPSETS, AND

NETWORKING AND COMMUNICATIONS PRODUCTS. ASSEMBLY AND TEST OF

NAND FLASH MEMORY PRODUCTS MANUFACTURED BY IMFT IS PERFORMED BY

MICRON AND OTHER EXTERNAL SUBCONTRACTORS.

OUR PERFORMANCE EXPECTATIONS FOR BUSINESS INTEGRITY; ETHICS; AND

ENVIRONMENTAL, HEALTH, AND SAFETY COMPLIANCE ARE THE SAME,

REGARDLESS OF WHETHER OUR SUPPLIER AND SUBCONTRACTOR OPERATIONS

ARE BASED IN THE U.S. OR ELSEWHERE. OUR EMPLOYMENT PRACTICES ARE

CONSISTENT WITH, AND WE EXPECT OUR SUPPLIERS AND SUBCONTRACTORS

TO ABIDE BY, LOCAL COUNTRY LAW. IN ADDITION, WE IMPOSE A MINIMUM

EMPLOYEE AGE REQUIREMENT REGARDLESS OF LOCAL LAW.

WE HAVE THOUSANDS OF SUPPLIERS, INCLUDING SUBCONTRACTORS,

PROVIDING OUR VARIOUS MATERIALS AND SERVICE NEEDS. WE SET

EXPECTATIONS FOR SUPPLIER PERFORMANCE AND REINFORCE THOSE

EXPECTATIONS WITH PERIODIC ASSESSMENTS. WE COMMUNICATE THOSE

EXPECTATIONS TO OUR SUPPLIERS REGULARLY AND WORK WITH THEM TO

IMPLEMENT IMPROVEMENTS WHEN NECESSARY. WE SEEK, WHERE POSSIBLE,

TO HAVE SEVERAL SOURCES OF SUPPLY FOR ALL OF THESE MATERIALS AND

RESOURCES, BUT WE MAY RELY ON A SINGLE OR LIMITED NUMBER OF

SUPPLIERS, OR UPON SUPPLIERS IN A SINGLE COUNTRY. IN THOSE

CASES, WE DEVELOP AND IMPLEMENT PLANS AND ACTIONS TO REDUCE THE

EXPOSURE THAT WOULD RESULT FROM A DISRUPTION IN SUPPLY.

OUR PRODUCTS TYPICALLY ARE PRODUCED AT MULTIPLE INTEL FACILITIES

AT VARIOUS SITES AROUND THE WORLD, OR BY SUBCONTRACTORS WHO HAVE

MULTIPLE FACILITIES. HOWEVER, SOME PRODUCTS ARE PRODUCED IN ONLY

ONE INTEL OR SUBCONTRACTOR FACILITY, AND WE SEEK TO IMPLEMENT

ACTIONS AND PLANS TO REDUCE THE EXPOSURE THAT WOULD RESULT FROM

A DISRUPTION AT ANY SUCH FACILITY. ON A WORLDWIDE BASIS, WE

REGULARLY EVALUATE OUR KEY INFRASTRUCTURE, SYSTEMS, SERVICES,

AND SUPPLIERS, BOTH INTERNALLY AND EXTERNALLY, TO SEEK TO

IDENTIFY SIGNIFICANT VULNERABILITIES AS WELL AS AREAS OF

POTENTIAL BUSINESS IMPACT IF A DISRUPTIVE EVENT WERE TO OCCUR.

ONCE VULNERABILITY IS IDENTIFIED, WE ASSESS THE RISKS, AND AS WE

CONSIDER IT TO BE APPROPRIATE, WE INITIATE ACTIONS INTENDED TO

REDUCE THE RISKS AND THEIR POTENTIAL IMPACT. HOWEVER, THERE CAN

BE NO ASSURANCE THAT WE HAVE IDENTIFIED ALL SIGNIFICANT RISKS OR

THAT WE CAN MITIGATE ALL IDENTIFIED RISKS WITH REASONABLE

EFFORT. SEE RISK FACTORS IN PART I, ITEM 1A OF THIS

FORM

10-K.

WE MAINTAIN A PROGRAM OF INSURANCE COVERAGE FOR VARIOUS TYPES OF

PROPERTY, CASUALTY, AND OTHER RISKS. WE PLACE OUR INSURANCE

COVERAGE WITH VARIOUS CARRIERS IN NUMEROUS JURISDICTIONS. THE

POLICIES ARE SUBJECT TO DEDUCTIBLES AND EXCLUSIONS THAT RESULT

IN OUR RETENTION OF A LEVEL OF RISK ON A SELF-INSURANCE BASIS.

THE TYPES AND AMOUNTS OF INSURANCE OBTAINED VARY FROM TIME TO

TIME AND FROM LOCATION TO LOCATION, DEPENDING ON AVAILABILITY,

COST, AND OUR DECISIONS WITH RESPECT TO RISK RETENTION. OUR

WORLDWIDE RISK AND INSURANCE PROGRAMS ARE REGULARLY EVALUATED TO

SEEK TO OBTAIN THE MOST FAVORABLE TERMS AND CONDITIONS.

RESEARCH

AND DEVELOPMENT

WE CONTINUE TO BE COMMITTED TO INVESTING IN WORLD-CLASS

TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT, PARTICULARLY IN THE AREA OF THE DESIGN

AND MANUFACTURE OF INTEGRATED CIRCUITS. RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

(R&D) EXPENDITURES IN 2006 AMOUNTED TO $5.9 BILLION ($5.1

BILLION IN FISCAL YEAR 2005 AND $4.8 BILLION IN FISCAL YEAR

2004). THE INCREASE IN R&D EXPENDITURES WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO

SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION EFFECTS OF $487 MILLION. SEE NOTE

3: EMPLOYEE EQUITY INCENTIVE PLANS IN PART II, ITEM 8 OF

THIS FORM

10-K.

OUR R&D ACTIVITIES ARE DIRECTED TOWARD DEVELOPING

INNOVATIONS THAT WE BELIEVE WILL DELIVER THE NEXT GENERATION OF

PRODUCTS AND PLATFORMS, WHICH WILL IN TURN ENABLE NEW FORM

FACTORS AND NEW USAGE MODELS FOR BUSINESSES AND CONSUMERS. WE

ARE FOCUSING OUR R&D EFFORTS ON ADVANCED COMPUTING,

COMMUNICATIONS, AND WIRELESS TECHNOLOGIES BY DEVELOPING NEW

MICROARCHITECTURES, ADVANCING OUR SILICON MANUFACTURING PROCESS

TECHNOLOGY, DELIVERING THE NEXT GENERATION OF MICROPROCESSORS

AND CHIPSETS, IMPROVING OUR PLATFORM INITIATIVES, AND DEVELOPING

SOFTWARE SOLUTIONS AND TOOLS TO SUPPORT OUR TECHNOLOGIES. IN

LINE WITH THESE EFFORTS, WE PLAN TO INTRODUCE A NEW

MICROARCHITECTURE APPROXIMATELY EVERY TWO YEARS AND RAMP THE

NEXT GENERATION OF SILICON PROCESS TECHNOLOGY IN THE INTERVENING

YEARS. OUR R&D EFFORTS ENABLE NEW LEVELS OF PERFORMANCE AND

ADDRESS AREAS SUCH AS SCALABILITY FOR MULTI-CORE ARCHITECTURES,

SYSTEM MANAGEABILITY, ENERGY EFFICIENCY, DIGITAL CONTENT

PROTECTION, AND NEW COMMUNICATION CAPABILITIES. OUR LEADERSHIP

IN SILICON TECHNOLOGY HAS ENABLED US TO MAKE MOORES

LAW A REALITY. MOORES LAW PREDICTED THAT TRANSISTOR

DENSITY ON INTEGRATED CIRCUITS WOULD DOUBLE ABOUT EVERY TWO

YEARS. OUR LEADERSHIP IN SILICON TECHNOLOGY HELPS TO CONTINUE TO

MAKE MOORES LAW A REALITY WHILE ALSO BRINGING NEW

CAPABILITIES INTO SILICON AND PRODUCING NEW PRODUCTS AND

PLATFORMS OPTIMIZED FOR A WIDER VARIETY OF APPLICATIONS. WE HAVE

COMPLETED DEVELOPMENT OF OUR 45-NANOMETER PROCESS TECHNOLOGY,

AND WE EXPECT TO BEGIN MANUFACTURING PRODUCTS USING OUR

45-NANOMETER PROCESS TECHNOLOGY IN THE SECOND HALF OF 2007. IN

THE AREA OF WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS, OUR INITIATIVES FOCUS ON

DELIVERING THE TECHNOLOGIES THAT WILL ENABLE IMPROVED WIRELESS

CAPABILITIES, INCLUDING EXPANDING AND PROLIFERATING WIMAX

TECHNOLOGIES AND PRODUCTS.

MERCHANDISE AND A RIGHT OF RETURN ON STIPULATED QUANTITIES OF

UNSOLD MERCHANDISE. WE ALSO UTILIZE THIRD-PARTY SALES

REPRESENTATIVES WHO GENERALLY DO NOT OFFER DIRECTLY COMPETITIVE

PRODUCTS BUT MAY CARRY COMPLEMENTARY ITEMS MANUFACTURED BY

OTHERS. SALES REPRESENTATIVES DO NOT MAINTAIN A PRODUCT

INVENTORY; INSTEAD, THEIR CUSTOMERS PLACE ORDERS DIRECTLY WITH

US OR THROUGH DISTRIBUTORS.

OUR WORLDWIDE RESELLER SALES CHANNEL CONSISTS OF THOUSANDS OF

INDIRECT CUSTOMERS WHO ARE SYSTEMS BUILDERS AND PURCHASE INTEL

MICROPROCESSORS AND OTHER PRODUCTS FROM OUR DISTRIBUTORS. WE

HAVE A BOXED PROCESSOR PROGRAM THAT ALLOWS

DISTRIBUTORS TO SELL INTEL MICROPROCESSORS IN SMALL QUANTITIES

TO THESE SYSTEMS-BUILDER CUSTOMERS; BOXED PROCESSORS ARE ALSO

MADE AVAILABLE IN DIRECT RETAIL OUTLETS.

OUR CORPORATE MARKETING FOCUS IS ON MULTI-CORE MICROPROCESSORS,

WHICH INCLUDE INTEL CORE 2 DUO, INTEL CORE 2 EXTREME,

AND INTEL CORE 2 QUAD PROCESSORS. THESE PROCESSORS ARE AT

THE CENTER OF INTELS MOST ADVANCED PLATFORMS, WHICH

INCLUDE INTEL CENTRINO MOBILE TECHNOLOGY, INTEL VPRO TECHNOLOGY,

AND INTEL VIIV TECHNOLOGY. THE INTEL CORE 2 QUAD, INTEL

CORE 2 EXTREME, INTEL CORE 2 DUO, ITANIUM, INTEL XEON,

PENTIUM, AND CELERON TRADEMARKS MAKE UP OUR PROCESSOR BRANDS. WE

PROMOTE BRAND AWARENESS AND GENERATE DEMAND THROUGH OUR OWN

DIRECT MARKETING AS WELL AS CO-MARKETING PROGRAMS. OUR DIRECT

MARKETING ACTIVITIES INCLUDE TELEVISION, PRINT AND WEB-BASED

ADVERTISING, AS WELL AS PRESS RELATIONS, CONSUMER AND TRADE

EVENTS, AND INDUSTRY AND CONSUMER COMMUNICATIONS. WE MARKET TO

CONSUMER AND BUSINESS AUDIENCES AND FOCUS ON BUILDING AWARENESS

AND GENERATING DEMAND FOR INCREASED PERFORMANCE, POWER

EFFICIENCY, AND NEW CAPABILITIES.

PURCHASES BY CUSTOMERS OFTEN ALLOW THEM TO PARTICIPATE IN

COOPERATIVE ADVERTISING AND MARKETING PROGRAMS SUCH AS THE INTEL

INSIDE

®

PROGRAM. THROUGH THE INTEL INSIDE PROGRAM, CERTAIN CUSTOMERS ARE

LICENSED TO PLACE INTEL LOGOS ON COMPUTERS CONTAINING OUR

MICROPROCESSORS AND OUR OTHER TECHNOLOGY, AND TO USE OUR BRANDS

IN MARKETING ACTIVITIES. THE PROGRAM INCLUDES A MARKET

DEVELOPMENT COMPONENT THAT ACCRUES FUNDS BASED ON PURCHASES AND

PARTIALLY REIMBURSES THE OEMS FOR MARKETING ACTIVITIES FOR

PRODUCTS FEATURING INTEL BRANDS, SUBJECT TO THE OEMS MEETING

DEFINED CRITERIA. THIS PROGRAM BROADENS THE REACH OF OUR BRANDS

BEYOND THE SCOPE OF OUR OWN DIRECT ADVERTISING. IN ADDITION, IT

PROVIDES US WITH THE OPPORTUNITY TO DO JOINT MARKETING WITH

CERTAIN CUSTOMERS.

OUR PRODUCTS ARE TYPICALLY SHIPPED UNDER TERMS THAT TRANSFER

TITLE TO THE CUSTOMER, EVEN IN ARRANGEMENTS FOR WHICH THE

RECOGNITION OF REVENUE ON THE SALE IS DEFERRED. OUR STANDARD

TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF SALE TYPICALLY PROVIDE THAT PAYMENT IS

DUE AT A LATER DATE, GENERALLY 30 DAYS AFTER SHIPMENT, DELIVERY,

OR THE CUSTOMERS USE OF THE PRODUCT. OUR CREDIT DEPARTMENT

SETS ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND SHIPPING LIMITS FOR INDIVIDUAL

CUSTOMERS FOR THE PURPOSE OF CONTROLLING CREDIT RISK TO INTEL

ARISING FROM OUTSTANDING ACCOUNT BALANCES. WE ASSESS CREDIT RISK

THROUGH QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE ANALYSIS, AND FROM THIS

ANALYSIS, WE ESTABLISH CREDIT LIMITS AND DETERMINE WHETHER WE

WILL SEEK TO USE ONE OR MORE CREDIT SUPPORT DEVICES, SUCH AS

OBTAINING SOME FORM OF THIRD-PARTY GUARANTY OR STANDBY LETTER OF

CREDIT, OR OBTAINING CREDIT INSURANCE FOR ALL OR A PORTION OF

THE ACCOUNT BALANCE. CREDIT LOSSES MAY STILL BE INCURRED DUE TO

BANKRUPTCY, FRAUD, OR OTHER FAILURE OF THE CUSTOMER TO PAY. SEE

FOR

INFORMATION ABOUT OUR ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL RECEIVABLES.

BACKLOG

WE DO NOT BELIEVE THAT BACKLOG AS OF ANY PARTICULAR DATE IS

MEANINGFUL, AS OUR SALES ARE MADE PRIMARILY PURSUANT TO STANDARD

PURCHASE ORDERS FOR DELIVERY OF PRODUCTS. ONLY A SMALL PORTION

OF OUR ORDERS ARE NON-CANCELABLE, AND THE DOLLAR AMOUNT

ASSOCIATED WITH THE NON-CANCELABLE PORTION IS NOT SIGNIFICANT.

COMPETITION

OUR PRODUCTS COMPETE PRIMARILY ON THE BASIS OF PERFORMANCE,

FEATURES, QUALITY, BRAND RECOGNITION, PRICE, AND AVAILABILITY.

OUR ABILITY TO COMPETE DEPENDS ON OUR ABILITY TO PROVIDE

INNOVATIVE PRODUCTS AND WORLDWIDE SUPPORT FOR OUR CUSTOMERS AT

COMPETITIVE PRICES, INCLUDING PROVIDING IMPROVED

ENERGY-EFFICIENT PERFORMANCE, ENHANCED SECURITY, REDUCED HEAT

OUTPUT, MANAGEABILITY, AND INTEGRATED SOLUTIONS. IN ADDITION TO

OUR VARIOUS COMPUTING, NETWORKING, AND COMMUNICATIONS PRODUCTS,

WE OFFER PLATFORMS THAT INCORPORATE VARIOUS COMPONENTS, WHICH

BRING TOGETHER A COLLECTION OF TECHNOLOGIES THAT WE BELIEVE

CREATE A BETTER END-USER SOLUTION THAN IF THE INGREDIENTS WERE

USED SEPARATELY.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE SEMICONDUCTOR INDUSTRY IS CHARACTERIZED BY RAPID ADVANCES IN

TECHNOLOGY AND NEW PRODUCT INTRODUCTIONS. AS UNIT VOLUMES OF A

PARTICULAR PRODUCT GROW, PRODUCTION EXPERIENCE IS ACCUMULATED

AND COSTS TYPICALLY DECREASE, FURTHER COMPETITION DEVELOPS, AND

AS A RESULT, PRICES DECLINE. THE LIFE CYCLE OF OUR PRODUCTS IS

VERY SHORT, SOMETIMES LESS THAN A YEAR. OUR ABILITY TO COMPETE

DEPENDS ON OUR ABILITY TO IMPROVE OUR PRODUCTS AND PROCESSES

FASTER THAN OUR COMPETITORS, ANTICIPATE CHANGING CUSTOMER

REQUIREMENTS, AND DEVELOP AND LAUNCH NEW PRODUCTS AND PLATFORMS,

WHILE REDUCING OUR AVERAGE PER UNIT COSTS. WHEN WE BELIEVE IT IS

APPROPRIATE, WE WILL TAKE VARIOUS STEPS, INCLUDING INTRODUCING

NEW PRODUCTS AND PLATFORMS, DISCONTINUING OLDER PRODUCTS,

REDUCING PRICES, AND OFFERING REBATES AND OTHER INCENTIVES, TO

INCREASE ACCEPTANCE OF OUR LATEST PRODUCTS AND TO BE COMPETITIVE

WITHIN EACH RELEVANT MARKET SEGMENT. OUR PRODUCTS COMPETE WITH

PRODUCTS DEVELOPED FOR SIMILAR OR RIVAL ARCHITECTURES AND WITH

PRODUCTS BASED ON THE SAME OR RIVAL STANDARDS. WE CANNOT PREDICT

WHICH COMPETING STANDARDS WILL BECOME THE PREVAILING STANDARDS

IN THE MARKET SEGMENTS IN WHICH WE COMPETE. SEE RISK

FACTORS IN PART I, ITEM 1A OF THIS FORM

10-K.

MANY COMPANIES COMPETE WITH US IN THE VARIOUS COMPUTING,

NETWORKING, AND COMMUNICATIONS MARKET SEGMENTS, AND ARE ENGAGED

IN THE SAME BASIC BUSINESS ACTIVITIES, INCLUDING RESEARCH AND

DEVELOPMENT. WORLDWIDE, THESE COMPETITORS RANGE IN SIZE FROM

LARGE ESTABLISHED MULTINATIONAL COMPANIES WITH MULTIPLE PRODUCT

LINES TO SMALLER COMPANIES AND NEW ENTRANTS TO THE MARKETPLACE

THAT COMPETE IN SPECIALIZED MARKET SEGMENTS. SOME OF OUR

COMPETITORS MAY HAVE DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENTS WITH OTHER

COMPANIES, AND IN SOME CASES OUR COMPETITORS MAY ALSO BE OUR

CUSTOMERS

AND/OR

SUPPLIERS. PRODUCT OFFERINGS MAY CROSS OVER INTO MULTIPLE

PRODUCT CATEGORIES, OFFERING US NEW OPPORTUNITIES BUT ALSO

RESULTING IN MORE COMPETITION. IT MAY BE DIFFICULT FOR US TO

COMPETE IN MARKET SEGMENTS WHERE OUR COMPETITORS HAVE

ESTABLISHED PRODUCTS AND BRAND RECOGNITION.

WE BELIEVE THAT OUR NETWORK OF MANUFACTURING FACILITIES AND

ASSEMBLY AND TEST FACILITIES GIVES US A COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE.

THIS NETWORK ENABLES US TO HAVE MORE DIRECT CONTROL OVER OUR

PROCESSES, QUALITY CONTROL, PRODUCT COST, VOLUME, TIMING OF

PRODUCTION, AND OTHER FACTORS. THESE FACILITIES REQUIRE

SIGNIFICANT UP-FRONT CAPITAL SPENDING, AND MANY OF OUR

COMPETITORS DO NOT OWN SUCH FACILITIES BECAUSE THEY CANNOT

AFFORD TO DO SO OR BECAUSE THEIR BUSINESS MODELS INVOLVE THE USE

OF THIRD-PARTY FACILITIES FOR MANUFACTURING AND ASSEMBLY AND

TEST. THESE FABLESS SEMICONDUCTOR COMPANIES INCLUDE

BROADCOM CORPORATION, NVIDIA CORPORATION, QUALCOMM INCORPORATED,

AND VIA TECHNOLOGIES, INC. (VIA). SOME OF OUR COMPETITORS OWN

PORTIONS OF SUCH FACILITIES THROUGH INVESTMENT OR JOINT-VENTURE

ARRANGEMENTS WITH OTHER COMPANIES. THERE IS A GROUP OF

THIRD-PARTY MANUFACTURING COMPANIES (FOUNDRIES) AND ASSEMBLY AND

TEST SUBCONTRACTORS THAT OFFERS THEIR SERVICES TO COMPANIES

WITHOUT OWNED FACILITIES OR COMPANIES NEEDING ADDITIONAL

CAPACITY. THESE FOUNDRIES AND SUBCONTRACTORS MAY ALSO OFFER

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, DESIGN SERVICES, AND OTHER GOODS AND

SERVICES TO OUR COMPETITORS. COMPETITORS WHO OUTSOURCE THEIR

MANUFACTURING AND ASSEMBLY AND TEST OPERATIONS CAN SIGNIFICANTLY

REDUCE THEIR CAPITAL EXPENDITURES.

WE PLAN TO CONTINUE TO CULTIVATE NEW BUSINESSES AND WORK WITH

THE COMPUTING AND COMMUNICATIONS INDUSTRIES THROUGH STANDARDS

BODIES, TRADE ASSOCIATIONS, OEMS, ODMS, AND INDEPENDENT SOFTWARE

AND OPERATING SYSTEM VENDORS TO HELP ALIGN THE INDUSTRY TO OFFER

PRODUCTS THAT TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE LATEST MARKET TRENDS AND

USAGE MODELS. THESE EFFORTS INCLUDE HELPING TO BUILD OUT THE

INFRASTRUCTURE FOR WIRELESS NETWORK CONNECTIVITY. WE ARE ALSO

WORKING WITH THESE INDUSTRIES TO DEVELOP SOFTWARE APPLICATIONS

AND OPERATING SYSTEMS THAT TAKE ADVANTAGE OF OUR PLATFORMS

THROUGH PROGRAMS SUCH AS THE

INTEL

®

SOFTWARE PARTNER PROGRAM, WHICH PROVIDES OPPORTUNITIES THAT HELP

COMPANIES DEVELOP, MARKET, AND SELL SOLUTIONS THAT TAKE

ADVANTAGE OF THE LATEST INTEL PLATFORMS AND TECHNOLOGIES. WE

FREQUENTLY PARTICIPATE IN INDUSTRY INITIATIVES DESIGNED TO

DISCUSS AND AGREE UPON TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS AND OTHER

ASPECTS OF TECHNOLOGIES THAT COULD BE ADOPTED AS STANDARDS BY

STANDARDS-SETTING ORGANIZATIONS. IN ADDITION, WE WORK

COLLABORATIVELY WITH OTHER COMPANIES TO PROTECT DIGITAL CONTENT

AND THE CONSUMER BY DEVELOPING CONTENT PROTECTION SPECIFICATIONS

SUCH AS THE DIGITAL TRANSMISSION CONTENT PROTECTION (DTCP)

SPECIFICATION. DTCP DEFINES A SECURE PROTOCOL FOR PROTECTING

AUDIO AND VIDEO ENTERTAINMENT CONTENT FROM ILLEGAL COPYING,

INTERCEPTING, AND TAMPERING AS IT MOVES ACROSS DIGITAL

INTERFACES SUCH AS UNIVERSAL SERIAL BUS (USB) AND

IP-BASED

HOME NETWORKS. OUR COMPETITORS MAY ALSO PARTICIPATE IN THE SAME

INITIATIVES AND SPECIFICATION DEVELOPMENT. OUR PARTICIPATION

DOES NOT ENSURE THAT ANY STANDARDS OR SPECIFICATIONS ADOPTED BY

THESE ORGANIZATIONS WILL BE CONSISTENT WITH OUR PRODUCT

PLANNING. WE CONTINUOUSLY EVALUATE OUR PRODUCT OFFERINGS AND THE

TIMING OF THEIR INTRODUCTIONS, TAKING INTO ACCOUNT FACTORS SUCH

AS CUSTOMER REQUIREMENTS AND AVAILABILITY OF INFRASTRUCTURE TO

TAKE ADVANTAGE OF PRODUCT FEATURES, PERFORMANCE, AND MATURITY OF

APPLICATION SOFTWARE FOR EACH TYPE OF PRODUCT IN THE RELEVANT

MARKET SEGMENTS.

COMPANIES IN THE SEMICONDUCTOR INDUSTRY OFTEN RELY ON THE

ABILITY TO LICENSE PATENTS FROM EACH OTHER IN ORDER TO COMPETE

IN TODAYS MARKETS. MANY OF OUR COMPETITORS HAVE BROAD

CROSS-LICENSES OR LICENSES WITH US, AND UNDER CURRENT CASE LAW,

SOME SUCH LICENSES MAY PERMIT THESE COMPETITORS TO PASS OUR

PATENT RIGHTS ON TO OTHERS. IF ONE OF THESE LICENSEES BECOMES A

FOUNDRY, OUR COMPETITORS MIGHT BE ABLE TO AVOID OUR PATENT

RIGHTS IN MANUFACTURING COMPETING PRODUCTS. IN ADDITION TO

LICENSING OUR PATENTS TO COMPETITORS, WE PARTICIPATE IN SOME

INDUSTRY ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE ENGAGED IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF

STANDARDS OR SPECIFICATIONS AND MAY REQUIRE US TO LICENSE OUR

PATENTS TO OTHER COMPANIES THAT ADOPT SUCH INDUSTRY STANDARDS OR

SPECIFICATIONS, EVEN WHEN SUCH ORGANIZATIONS DO NOT ADOPT THE

STANDARDS OR SPECIFICATIONS PROPOSED BY INTEL. ANY INTEL PATENTS

THAT MAY BE SUBJECT TO THE LICENSING POLICIES OF SUCH

ORGANIZATIONS DUE TO OUR PARTICIPATION IN SUCH INITIATIVES MIGHT

NOT, IN SOME SITUATIONS, BE AVAILABLE FOR US TO ENFORCE AGAINST

OTHERS WHO MIGHT BE INFRINGING THOSE PATENTS. SEE RISK

FACTORS IN PART I, ITEM 1A OF THIS FORM

TABLE OF CONTENTS

WE CONTINUE TO BE LARGELY DEPENDENT ON THE SUCCESS OF OUR

MICROPROCESSOR BUSINESS. OUR ABILITY TO COMPETE DEPENDS ON OUR

ABILITY TO DELIVER NEW MICROPROCESSOR PRODUCTS WITH IMPROVED

OVERALL PERFORMANCE

AND/OR

IMPROVED ENERGY-EFFICIENT PERFORMANCE AT COMPETITIVE PRICES.

MANY OF OUR COMPETITORS, INCLUDING ADVANCED MICRO DEVICES, INC.

(AMD), OUR PRIMARY MICROPROCESSOR COMPETITOR, MARKET

SOFTWARE-COMPATIBLE PRODUCTS THAT COMPETE WITH OUR PROCESSORS.

WE ALSO FACE COMPETITION FROM COMPANIES OFFERING RIVAL

MICROARCHITECTURE DESIGNS, SUCH AS CELL BROADBAND ENGINE

ARCHITECTURE DEVELOPED JOINTLY BY INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS

MACHINES CORPORATION (IBM), SONY CORPORATION, AND TOSHIBA

CORPORATION. OUR DESKTOP PROCESSORS COMPETE WITH PRODUCTS

OFFERED BY AMD, IBM, AND VIA, AMONG OTHERS. OUR MOBILE

MICROPROCESSOR PRODUCTS COMPETE WITH PRODUCTS OFFERED BY AMD,

IBM, TRANSMETA CORPORATION, AND VIA, AMONG OTHERS. OUR SERVER

PROCESSORS COMPETE WITH SOFTWARE-COMPATIBLE PRODUCTS OFFERED BY

AMD AND WITH PRODUCTS BASED ON RIVAL ARCHITECTURES, INCLUDING

THE SERVICE-ORIENTED ARCHITECTURE (SOA) OFFERED BY IBM AND THE

SCALABLE PROCESSOR ARCHITECTURE (SPARC*) OFFERED BY SUN

MICROSYSTEMS, INC.

OUR CHIPSETS COMPETE IN THE VARIOUS MARKET SEGMENTS AGAINST

DIFFERENT TYPES OF CHIPSETS THAT SUPPORT EITHER OUR

MICROPROCESSOR PRODUCTS OR RIVAL MICROPROCESSOR PRODUCTS.

COMPETING CHIPSETS ARE PRODUCED BY COMPANIES SUCH AS ATI

TECHNOLOGIES, INC. (RECENTLY ACQUIRED BY AMD), NVIDIA, SILICON

INTEGRATED SYSTEMS CORPORATION (SIS), AND VIA. WE ALSO COMPETE

WITH COMPANIES OFFERING GRAPHICS COMPONENTS AND OTHER

SPECIAL-PURPOSE PRODUCTS USED IN THE DESKTOP, MOBILE, AND SERVER

MARKET SEGMENTS. ONE ASPECT OF OUR BUSINESS MODEL IS TO

INCORPORATE IMPROVED PERFORMANCE AND ADVANCED PROPERTIES INTO

OUR MICROPROCESSORS AND CHIPSETS, THE DEMAND FOR WHICH MAY

INCREASINGLY BE AFFECTED BY COMPETITION FROM COMPANIES, SUCH AS

NVIDIA, WHOSE BUSINESS MODELS ARE BASED ON INCORPORATING

IMPROVED PERFORMANCE INTO DEDICATED CHIPSETS AND OTHER

COMPONENTS, SUCH AS GRAPHICS CONTROLLERS.

OUR NOR AND NAND FLASH MEMORY PRODUCTS CURRENTLY COMPETE WITH

THE PRODUCTS OF OTHER COMPANIES, SUCH AS HYNIX SEMICONDUCTOR

INC., MICRON, SAMSUNG ELECTRONICS CO., LTD., SPANSION INC.,

STMICROELECTRONICS NV, AND TOSHIBA.

WE OFFER PRODUCTS DESIGNED FOR WIRED AND WIRELESS CONNECTIVITY;

FOR THE COMMUNICATIONS INFRASTRUCTURE, INCLUDING NETWORK

PROCESSORS; AND FOR NETWORKED STORAGE. THESE PRODUCTS CURRENTLY

COMPETE AGAINST OFFERINGS FROM COMPANIES SUCH AS APPLIED MICRO

CIRCUITS CORPORATION, AMD, BROADCOM, FREESCALE SEMICONDUCTOR,

INC., IBM, OPNEXT, INC., SUN MICROSYSTEMS, AND VIA.

WE ALSO OFFER PLATFORMS FOR THE DESKTOP, MOBILE, AND SERVER

MARKET SEGMENTS THAT INTEGRATE COMPONENTS THAT ENABLE TARGETED

USAGE MODELS. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR PLATFORM OFFERINGS GIVE US A

COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE. OUR PLATFORMS ARE DESIGNED TO MEET THE

SPECIFIC NEEDS OF END USERS AND ARE OPTIMIZED TO DELIVER

INCREASED SECURITY AND MANAGEABILITY, ENERGY-EFFICIENT

PERFORMANCE, AND OTHER INNOVATIVE SOLUTIONS EMBEDDED INTO OUR

MICROPROCESSORS. WITH AMDS ACQUISITION OF ATI

TECHNOLOGIES, WE ANTICIPATE INCREASED PLATFORM COMPETITION IN

VARIOUS MARKET SEGMENTS.

ACQUISITIONS

AND STRATEGIC INVESTMENTS

DURING 2006, THE COMPANY DID NOT COMPLETE ANY ACQUISITIONS

QUALIFYING AS BUSINESS COMBINATIONS. IN 2006, INTEL FORMED IMFT,

A NAND FLASH MEMORY MANUFACTURING COMPANY, WITH MICRON. INTEL

INVESTED $1.3 BILLION IN RETURN FOR A 49% INTEREST. SEE

NOTE 17: VENTURE IN PART II, ITEM 8 OF THIS FORM

TRADEMARKS, AND MASKWORK RIGHTS. WE MAINTAIN AN ACTIVE PROGRAM

TO PROTECT OUR INVESTMENT IN TECHNOLOGY BY ATTEMPTING TO ENSURE

RESPECT FOR OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS. THE EXTENT OF THE

LEGAL PROTECTION GIVEN TO DIFFERENT TYPES OF INTELLECTUAL

PROPERTY RIGHTS VARIES UNDER DIFFERENT COUNTRIES LEGAL

SYSTEMS. WE INTEND TO LICENSE OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS

TABLE OF CONTENTS

WE HAVE FILED AND OBTAINED A NUMBER OF PATENTS IN THE U.S. AND

ABROAD. WHILE OUR PATENTS ARE AN IMPORTANT ELEMENT OF OUR

SUCCESS, OUR BUSINESS AS A WHOLE IS NOT MATERIALLY DEPENDENT ON

ANY ONE PATENT. WE AND OTHER COMPANIES IN THE COMPUTING,

TELECOMMUNICATIONS, AND RELATED HIGH-TECHNOLOGY FIELDS TYPICALLY

APPLY FOR AND RECEIVE, IN THE AGGREGATE, TENS OF THOUSANDS OF

OVERLAPPING PATENTS ANNUALLY IN THE U.S. AND OTHER COUNTRIES. WE

BELIEVE THAT THE DURATION OF THE APPLICABLE PATENTS WE ARE

GRANTED IS ADEQUATE RELATIVE TO THE EXPECTED LIVES OF OUR

PRODUCTS. BECAUSE OF THE FAST PACE OF INNOVATION AND PRODUCT

DEVELOPMENT, OUR PRODUCTS ARE OFTEN OBSOLETE BEFORE THE PATENTS

RELATED TO THEM EXPIRE, AND SOMETIMES ARE OBSOLETE BEFORE THE

PATENTS RELATED TO THEM ARE EVEN GRANTED. AS WE EXPAND OUR

PRODUCT OFFERINGS INTO NEW INDUSTRIES, SUCH AS CONSUMER

ELECTRONICS, WE ALSO SEEK TO EXTEND OUR PATENT DEVELOPMENT

EFFORTS TO PATENT SUCH PRODUCT OFFERINGS. ESTABLISHED

COMPETITORS IN EXISTING AND NEW INDUSTRIES, AS WELL AS COMPANIES

THAT PURCHASE AND ENFORCE PATENTS AND OTHER INTELLECTUAL

PROPERTY, MAY ALREADY HAVE PATENTS COVERING SIMILAR PRODUCTS.

THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO OBTAIN PATENTS

COVERING OUR OWN PRODUCTS, OR THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO OBTAIN

LICENSES FROM SUCH COMPANIES ON FAVORABLE TERMS OR AT ALL.

THE LARGE MAJORITY OF THE SOFTWARE WE DISTRIBUTE, INCLUDING

SOFTWARE EMBEDDED IN OUR COMPONENT AND SYSTEM-LEVEL PRODUCTS, IS

ENTITLED TO COPYRIGHT PROTECTION.

TO DISTINGUISH INTEL PRODUCTS FROM OUR COMPETITORS

PRODUCTS, WE HAVE OBTAINED CERTAIN TRADEMARKS AND TRADE NAMES

FOR OUR PRODUCTS, AND WE MAINTAIN COOPERATIVE ADVERTISING

PROGRAMS WITH CERTAIN CUSTOMERS TO PROMOTE OUR BRANDS AND TO

IDENTIFY PRODUCTS CONTAINING GENUINE INTEL COMPONENTS.

WE ALSO PROTECT CERTAIN DETAILS ABOUT OUR PROCESSES, PRODUCTS,

AND STRATEGIES AS TRADE SECRETS, KEEPING CONFIDENTIAL THE

INFORMATION THAT WE BELIEVE PROVIDES US WITH A COMPETITIVE

ADVANTAGE. WE HAVE ONGOING PROGRAMS DESIGNED TO MAINTAIN THE

CONFIDENTIALITY OF SUCH INFORMATION.

COMPLIANCE

WITH ENVIRONMENTAL, HEALTH, AND SAFETY REGULATIONS

INTEL IS COMMITTED TO ACHIEVING HIGH STANDARDS OF ENVIRONMENTAL

QUALITY AND PRODUCT SAFETY, AND STRIVES TO PROVIDE A SAFE AND

HEALTHY WORKPLACE FOR OUR EMPLOYEES, CONTRACTORS, AND THE

COMMUNITIES IN WHICH WE DO BUSINESS. WE HAVE ENVIRONMENTAL,

HEALTH, AND SAFETY (EHS) POLICIES AND EXPECTATIONS THAT APPLY TO

OUR GLOBAL OPERATIONS. EACH OF INTELS WORLDWIDE PRODUCTION

FACILITIES IS REGISTERED TO THE INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATION FOR

STANDARDIZATION (ISO) 14001 ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

STANDARD. INTELS INTERNAL EHS AUDITING PROGRAM ADDRESSES

NOT ONLY COMPLIANCE BUT ALSO BUSINESS RISK AND MANAGEMENT

SYSTEMS. WE FOCUS ON MINIMIZING AND PROPERLY MANAGING HAZARDOUS

MATERIALS USED IN OUR FACILITIES AND PRODUCTS. WE MONITOR

REGULATORY AND RESOURCE TRENDS AND SET COMPANY-WIDE SHORT- AND

LONG-TERM PERFORMANCE TARGETS FOR KEY RESOURCES AND EMISSIONS.

THESE TARGETS ADDRESS SEVERAL PARAMETERS, INCLUDING ENERGY AND

WATER USE, CLIMATE CHANGE, WASTE RECYCLING, AND EMISSIONS. FOR

EXAMPLE, WE CONTINUE TO TAKE ACTION TO ACHIEVE OUR GLOBAL ENERGY

REDUCTION GOAL BY INVESTING IN ENERGY CONSERVATION PROJECTS IN

OUR FACTORIES AND WORKING WITH SUPPLIERS OF MANUFACTURING TOOLS

TO IMPROVE ENERGY EFFICIENCY. INTEL ALSO IS FOCUSED ON

DEVELOPING INNOVATIVE SOLUTIONS TO IMPROVE THE ENERGY EFFICIENCY

OF OUR PRODUCTS AND THOSE OF OUR CUSTOMERS. INTEL HAS TAKEN A

HOLISTIC APPROACH TO POWER MANAGEMENT, ADDRESSING THE CHALLENGE

AT ALL LEVELS, INCLUDING THE SILICON, PACKAGE, CIRCUIT,

MICRO/MACRO ARCHITECTURE, PLATFORM, AND SOFTWARE LEVELS.

THE PRODUCTION OF INTEL PRODUCTS REQUIRES THE USE OF HAZARDOUS

MATERIALS THAT ARE SUBJECT TO A BROAD ARRAY OF EHS LAWS AND

REGULATIONS. INTEL ACTIVELY MONITORS THE MATERIALS USED IN THE

PRODUCTION OF OUR PRODUCTS. INTEL HAS SPECIFIC RESTRICTIONS ON

THE CONTENT OF CERTAIN HAZARDOUS MATERIALS IN OUR PRODUCTS, AS

WELL AS THOSE OF OUR SUPPLIERS AND OUTSOURCED MANUFACTURERS AND

SUBCONTRACTORS. INTEL CONTINUES TO MAKE EFFORTS TO REDUCE

HAZARDOUS MATERIALS IN OUR PRODUCTS TO POSITION US TO MEET

VARIOUS ENVIRONMENTAL RESTRICTIONS ON PRODUCT CONTENT THROUGHOUT

THE WORLD. AS INTEL CONTINUES TO ADVANCE PROCESS TECHNOLOGY, THE

MATERIALS, TECHNOLOGIES, AND PRODUCTS THEMSELVES BECOME

INCREASINGLY COMPLEX. OUR EVALUATIONS OF MATERIALS FOR USE IN

R&D AND PRODUCTION TAKE INTO ACCOUNT EHS CONSIDERATIONS.

COMPLIANCE WITH THESE COMPLEX LAWS AND REGULATIONS, AS WELL AS

INTERNAL VOLUNTARY PROGRAMS, IS INTEGRATED INTO INTELS

DESIGN FOR EHS PROGRAMS.

INTEL IS COMMITTED TO THE PROTECTION OF HUMAN RIGHTS AND THE

ENVIRONMENT THROUGHOUT ITS SUPPLY CHAIN. INTEL EXPECTS SUPPLIERS

TO UNDERSTAND AND FULLY COMPLY WITH ALL EHS AND RELATED LAWS AND

REGULATIONS. IN ADDITION, SUPPLIERS ARE EXPECTED TO ABIDE BY

INTELS POLICIES, SUCH AS ITS CORPORATE BUSINESS PRINCIPLES

AND THE ELECTRONICS INDUSTRY CODE OF CONDUCT; MAINTAIN

PROGRESSIVE EMPLOYMENT PRACTICES; AND COMPLY WITH OTHER

APPLICABLE LAWS INCLUDING, AT A MINIMUM, THOSE COVERING

NON-DISCRIMINATION IN THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF EMPLOYMENT,

CHILD LABOR, MINIMUM WAGES, EMPLOYEE BENEFITS, AND WORK HOURS.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS

FLUCTUATIONS

IN DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL

RESULTS AND ARE DIFFICULT TO FORECAST.

IF DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS FLUCTUATES, OUR REVENUE AND GROSS

MARGIN COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED. IMPORTANT FACTORS THAT COULD

CAUSE DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS TO FLUCTUATE INCLUDE.



COMPETITIVE PRESSURES FROM COMPANIES THAT HAVE COMPETING

PRODUCTS, CHIP ARCHITECTURES, AND MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGIES

INCLUDING PRODUCT OFFERINGS, MARKETING PROGRAMS, AND PRICING

PRESSURES;



CHANGES IN CUSTOMER PRODUCT NEEDS;



CHANGES IN THE LEVEL OF CUSTOMERS COMPONENT INVENTORY;



CHANGES IN BUSINESS AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, INCLUDING A

DOWNTURN IN THE SEMICONDUCTOR INDUSTRY;



STRATEGIC ACTIONS TAKEN BY OUR COMPETITORS; AND/OR



MARKET ACCEPTANCE OF OUR PRODUCTS.

IF DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS IS REDUCED, OUR MANUFACTURING

AND/OR

ASSEMBLY AND TEST CAPACITY COULD BE UNDER-UTILIZED, AND WE MAY

BE REQUIRED TO RECORD AN IMPAIRMENT ON OUR LONG-LIVED ASSETS

INCLUDING FACILITIES AND EQUIPMENT, AS WELL AS INTANGIBLE

ASSETS, WHICH WOULD INCREASE OUR EXPENSES. IN ADDITION, FACTORY

PLANNING DECISIONS MAY SHORTEN THE USEFUL LIVES OF LONG-LIVED

ASSETS INCLUDING FACILITIES AND EQUIPMENT AND CAUSE US TO

ACCELERATE DEPRECIATION. IN THE LONG TERM, IF DEMAND FOR OUR

PRODUCTS INCREASES, WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO ADD MANUFACTURING

AND/OR

ASSEMBLY AND TEST CAPACITY FAST ENOUGH TO MEET MARKET DEMAND.

THESE CHANGES IN DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS, AND CHANGES IN OUR

CUSTOMERS PRODUCT NEEDS, COULD HAVE A VARIETY OF NEGATIVE

EFFECTS ON OUR COMPETITIVE POSITION AND OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS,

AND, IN CERTAIN CASES, MAY REDUCE OUR REVENUE, INCREASE OUR

COSTS, LOWER OUR GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE, OR REQUIRE US TO

RECOGNIZE IMPAIRMENTS OF OUR ASSETS. IN ADDITION, IF DEMAND FOR

OUR PRODUCTS IS REDUCED OR WE FAIL TO ACCURATELY FORECAST

DEMAND, WE COULD BE REQUIRED TO WRITE DOWN INVENTORY, WHICH

WOULD HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON OUR GROSS MARGIN.

THE

SEMICONDUCTOR INDUSTRY AND OUR OPERATIONS ARE CHARACTERIZED BY A

HIGH PERCENTAGE OF COSTS THAT ARE FIXED OR OTHERWISE DIFFICULT

TO REDUCE IN THE SHORT TERM, AND BY PRODUCT DEMAND THAT IS

HIGHLY VARIABLE AND SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT DOWNTURNS THAT MAY

ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, AND

FINANCIAL CONDITION.

THE SEMICONDUCTOR INDUSTRY AND OUR OPERATIONS ARE CHARACTERIZED

BY HIGH COSTS, SUCH AS THOSE RELATED TO FACILITY CONSTRUCTION

AND EQUIPMENT, RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, AND EMPLOYMENT AND

TRAINING OF A HIGHLY SKILLED WORKFORCE, THAT ARE EITHER FIXED OR

DIFFICULT TO REDUCE IN THE SHORT TERM. AT THE SAME TIME, DEMAND

FOR OUR PRODUCTS IS HIGHLY VARIABLE AND THERE HAVE BEEN

DOWNTURNS, OFTEN IN CONNECTION WITH MATURING PRODUCT CYCLES AS

WELL AS DOWNTURNS IN GENERAL ECONOMIC MARKET CONDITIONS. THESE

DOWNTURNS HAVE BEEN CHARACTERIZED BY REDUCED PRODUCT DEMAND,

MANUFACTURING OVERCAPACITY, HIGH INVENTORY LEVELS, AND LOWER

AVERAGE SELLING PRICES. THE COMBINATION OF THESE FACTORS MAY

CAUSE OUR REVENUE, GROSS MARGIN, CASH FLOW, AND PROFITABILITY TO

VARY SIGNIFICANTLY IN BOTH THE SHORT AND LONG TERM.

WE

OPERATE IN INTENSELY COMPETITIVE INDUSTRIES, AND OUR FAILURE TO

RESPOND QUICKLY TO TECHNOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENTS AND INCORPORATE

NEW FEATURES INTO OUR PRODUCTS COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON

OUR ABILITY TO COMPETE.

WE OPERATE IN INTENSELY COMPETITIVE INDUSTRIES THAT EXPERIENCE

RAPID TECHNOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENTS, CHANGES IN INDUSTRY STANDARDS,

CHANGES IN CUSTOMER REQUIREMENTS, AND FREQUENT NEW PRODUCT

INTRODUCTIONS AND IMPROVEMENTS. IF WE ARE UNABLE TO RESPOND

QUICKLY AND SUCCESSFULLY TO THESE DEVELOPMENTS, WE MAY LOSE OUR

COMPETITIVE POSITION, AND OUR PRODUCTS OR TECHNOLOGIES MAY

BECOME UNCOMPETITIVE OR OBSOLETE. TO COMPETE SUCCESSFULLY, WE

MUST MAINTAIN A SUCCESSFUL R&D EFFORT, DEVELOP NEW PRODUCTS

AND PRODUCTION PROCESSES, AND IMPROVE OUR EXISTING PRODUCTS AND

PROCESSES AT THE SAME PACE OR AHEAD OF OUR COMPETITORS. WE MAY

NOT BE ABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY DEVELOP AND MARKET THESE NEW

PRODUCTS, THE PRODUCTS WE INVEST IN AND DEVELOP MAY NOT BE WELL

RECEIVED BY CUSTOMERS, AND PRODUCTS DEVELOPED AND NEW

TECHNOLOGIES OFFERED BY OTHERS MAY AFFECT THE DEMAND FOR OUR

PRODUCTS. THESE TYPES OF EVENTS COULD HAVE A VARIETY OF NEGATIVE

EFFECTS ON OUR COMPETITIVE POSITION AND OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS,

SUCH AS REDUCING OUR REVENUE, INCREASING OUR COSTS, LOWERING OUR

GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE, AND REQUIRING US TO RECOGNIZE

IMPAIRMENTS OF OUR ASSETS.

FLUCTUATIONS

IN THE MIX OF PRODUCTS SOLD MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL

RESULTS.

BECAUSE OF THE WIDE PRICE DIFFERENCES AMONG MOBILE, DESKTOP, AND

SERVER MICROPROCESSORS, THE MIX AND TYPES OF PERFORMANCE

CAPABILITIES OF MICROPROCESSORS SOLD AFFECT THE AVERAGE SELLING

PRICE OF OUR PRODUCTS AND HAVE A SUBSTANTIAL IMPACT ON OUR

REVENUE. OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS ALSO DEPEND IN PART ON THE MIX OF

OTHER PRODUCTS WE SELL, SUCH AS CHIPSETS, FLASH MEMORY, AND

OTHER SEMICONDUCTOR PRODUCTS. IN ADDITION, MORE RECENTLY

INTRODUCED PRODUCTS TEND TO HAVE HIGHER ASSOCIATED COSTS BECAUSE

OF INITIAL OVERALL DEVELOPMENT COSTS AND HIGHER

START-UP

COSTS. FLUCTUATIONS IN THE MIX AND TYPES OF OUR PRODUCTS MAY

ALSO AFFECT THE EXTENT TO WHICH WE ARE ABLE TO RECOVER OUR FIXED

COSTS AND INVESTMENTS THAT ARE ASSOCIATED WITH A PARTICULAR

PRODUCT, AND AS A RESULT CAN NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR FINANCIAL

TABLE OF CONTENTS

OUR

GLOBAL OPERATIONS SUBJECT US TO RISKS THAT MAY NEGATIVELY AFFECT

OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

WE HAVE SALES OFFICES, RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, MANUFACTURING,

AND ASSEMBLY AND TEST FACILITIES IN MANY COUNTRIES, AND AS A

RESULT, WE ARE SUBJECT TO RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH DOING BUSINESS

GLOBALLY. OUR GLOBAL OPERATIONS MAY BE SUBJECT TO RISKS THAT MAY

LIMIT OUR ABILITY TO MANUFACTURE, ASSEMBLE AND TEST, DESIGN,

DEVELOP, OR SELL PRODUCTS IN PARTICULAR COUNTRIES, WHICH COULD

IN TURN HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND

FINANCIAL CONDITION, INCLUDING.



SECURITY CONCERNS, SUCH AS ARMED CONFLICT AND CIVIL OR MILITARY

UNREST, CRIME, POLITICAL INSTABILITY, AND TERRORIST ACTIVITY;



HEALTH CONCERNS;



NATURAL DISASTERS;



INEFFICIENT AND LIMITED INFRASTRUCTURE AND DISRUPTIONS, SUCH AS

LARGE-SCALE OUTAGES OR INTERRUPTIONS OF SERVICE FROM UTILITIES

OR TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROVIDERS AND SUPPLY CHAIN INTERRUPTIONS;



DIFFERING EMPLOYMENT PRACTICES AND LABOR ISSUES;



LOCAL BUSINESS AND CULTURAL FACTORS THAT DIFFER FROM OUR NORMAL

STANDARDS AND PRACTICES;



REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS AND PROHIBITIONS THAT DIFFER BETWEEN

JURISDICTIONS; AND/OR



RESTRICTIONS ON OUR OPERATIONS BY GOVERNMENTS SEEKING TO SUPPORT

LOCAL INDUSTRIES, NATIONALIZATION OF OUR OPERATIONS, AND

RESTRICTIONS ON OUR ABILITY TO REPATRIATE EARNINGS.

IN ADDITION, ALTHOUGH MOST OF OUR PRODUCTS ARE PRICED AND PAID

FOR IN U.S. DOLLARS, A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF CERTAIN TYPES OF

EXPENSES, SUCH AS PAYROLL, UTILITIES, TAX, AND MARKETING

EXPENSES, ARE PAID IN LOCAL CURRENCIES. OUR HEDGING PROGRAMS

REDUCE, BUT DO NOT ALWAYS ENTIRELY ELIMINATE, THE IMPACT OF

CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE MOVEMENTS, AND THEREFORE FLUCTUATIONS IN

EXCHANGE RATES, INCLUDING THOSE CAUSED BY CURRENCY CONTROLS,

COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR BUSINESS OPERATING RESULTS AND

FINANCIAL CONDITION BY RESULTING IN LOWER REVENUE OR INCREASED

EXPENSES. IN ADDITION, CHANGES IN TARIFF AND IMPORT REGULATIONS

AND TO U.S. AND

NON-U.S.

MONETARY POLICIES MAY ALSO NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR REVENUE IN

THOSE AFFECTED COUNTRIES. VARYING TAX RATES IN DIFFERENT

JURISDICTIONS COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR OVERALL TAX RATE.

FAILURE

TO MEET OUR PRODUCTION TARGETS, RESULTING IN UNDERSUPPLY OR

OVERSUPPLY OF PRODUCTS, MAY ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR BUSINESS AND

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

PRODUCTION OF INTEGRATED CIRCUITS IS A COMPLEX PROCESS.

DISRUPTIONS IN THIS PROCESS CAN RESULT FROM DIFFICULTIES IN OUR

DEVELOPMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION OF NEW PROCESSES, ERRORS, AND

INTERRUPTIONS IN THE PROCESSES; DEFECTS IN MATERIALS; AND

DISRUPTIONS IN OUR SUPPLY OF MATERIALS OR RESOURCESALL OF

WHICH COULD AFFECT THE TIMING OF PRODUCTION RAMPS AND YIELDS.

FURTHERMORE, WE MAY NOT BE SUCCESSFUL OR EFFICIENT IN DEVELOPING

OR IMPLEMENTING NEW PRODUCTION PROCESSES. THE OCCURRENCE OF ANY

OF THE FOREGOING MAY RESULT IN OUR FAILURE TO INCREASE

PRODUCTION AS DESIRED, RESULTING IN HIGHER COSTS OR SUBSTANTIAL

DECREASES IN YIELDS, WHICH COULD IMPACT OUR ABILITY TO PRODUCE

SUFFICIENT VOLUME TO MEET SPECIFIC PRODUCT DEMAND. FURTHERMORE,

THE UNAVAILABILITY OR REDUCED AVAILABILITY OF CERTAIN PRODUCTS

COULD MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT TO IMPLEMENT OUR PLATFORM STRATEGY.

WE MAY ALSO EXPERIENCE INCREASES IN YIELDS. A SUBSTANTIAL

INCREASE IN YIELDS COULD RESULT IN HIGHER INVENTORY LEVELS AND

THE POSSIBILITY OF RESULTING EXCESS CAPACITY CHARGES AS WE SLOW

PRODUCTION TO REDUCE INVENTORY LEVELS. THE OCCURRENCE OF ANY OF

THESE EVENTS COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR BUSINESS AND RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS.

WE MAY

HAVE DIFFICULTIES OBTAINING THE RESOURCES OR PRODUCTS WE NEED

FOR MANUFACTURING OR ASSEMBLING OUR PRODUCTS OR OPERATING OTHER

ASPECTS OF OUR BUSINESS, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR

ABILITY TO MEET DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS AND MAY INCREASE OUR

COSTS.

WE HAVE THOUSANDS OF SUPPLIERS PROVIDING VARIOUS MATERIALS THAT

WE USE IN PRODUCTION OF OUR PRODUCTS AND OTHER ASPECTS OF OUR

BUSINESS, AND WE SEEK, WHERE POSSIBLE, TO HAVE SEVERAL SOURCES

OF SUPPLY FOR ALL OF THESE MATERIALS. HOWEVER, WE MAY RELY ON A

SINGLE OR A LIMITED NUMBER OF SUPPLIERS, OR UPON SUPPLIERS IN A

SINGLE COUNTRY, FOR THESE MATERIALS. THE INABILITY OF SUCH

SUPPLIERS TO DELIVER ADEQUATE SUPPLIES OF PRODUCTION MATERIALS

OR OTHER SUPPLIES COULD DISRUPT OUR PRODUCTION PROCESSES OR

COULD MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR US TO IMPLEMENT OUR PLATFORM

STRATEGY. IN ADDITION, PRODUCTION COULD BE DISRUPTED BY THE

UNAVAILABILITY OF THE RESOURCES USED IN PRODUCTION, SUCH AS

WATER, SILICON, ELECTRICITY, AND GASES. THE UNAVAILABILITY OR

REDUCED AVAILABILITY OF THE MATERIALS OR RESOURCES WE USE IN OUR

BUSINESS MAY REQUIRE US TO REDUCE PRODUCTION OF PRODUCTS OR MAY

REQUIRE US TO INCUR ADDITIONAL COSTS IN ORDER TO OBTAIN AN

ADEQUATE SUPPLY OF THESE MATERIALS OR RESOURCES. THE OCCURRENCE

OF ANY OF THESE EVENTS COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR BUSINESS AND

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

COSTS

RELATED TO PRODUCT DEFECTS AND ERRATA MAY HAVE AN ADVERSE IMPACT

ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND BUSINESS.

COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH UNEXPECTED PRODUCT DEFECTS AND ERRATA

(DEVIATIONS FROM PUBLISHED SPECIFICATIONS) INCLUDE, FOR EXAMPLE,

THE COSTS OF.



WRITING DOWN THE VALUE OF INVENTORY OF DEFECTIVE PRODUCTS;



DISPOSING OF DEFECTIVE PRODUCTS THAT CANNOT BE FIXED;



RECALLING DEFECTIVE PRODUCTS THAT HAVE BEEN SHIPPED TO CUSTOMERS;



PROVIDING PRODUCT REPLACEMENTS FOR OR MODIFICATIONS TO DEFECTIVE

PRODUCTS; AND/OR



DEFENDING AGAINST LITIGATION RELATED TO DEFECTIVE PRODUCTS.

THESE COSTS COULD BE SUBSTANTIAL AND MAY THEREFORE INCREASE OUR

EXPENSES AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR GROSS MARGIN. IN ADDITION, OUR

REPUTATION WITH OUR CUSTOMERS OR END USERS OF OUR PRODUCTS COULD

BE DAMAGED AS A RESULT OF SUCH PRODUCT DEFECTS AND ERRATA, AND

THE DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS COULD BE REDUCED. THESE FACTORS

COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS AND THE PROSPECTS

FOR OUR BUSINESS.

17

TABLE OF CONTENTS

WE MAY

BE SUBJECT TO CLAIMS OF INFRINGEMENT OF THIRD-PARTY INTELLECTUAL

PROPERTY RIGHTS, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR

BUSINESS.

FROM TIME TO TIME, THIRD PARTIES MAY ASSERT AGAINST US OR OUR

CUSTOMERS ALLEGED PATENT, COPYRIGHT, TRADEMARK, AND OTHER

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS TO TECHNOLOGIES THAT ARE IMPORTANT

TO OUR BUSINESS. WE MAY BE SUBJECT TO INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

INFRINGEMENT CLAIMS FROM CERTAIN INDIVIDUALS AND COMPANIES WHO

HAVE ACQUIRED PATENT PORTFOLIOS FOR THE SOLE PURPOSE OF

ASSERTING SUCH CLAIMS AGAINST OTHER COMPANIES. ANY CLAIMS THAT

OUR PRODUCTS OR PROCESSES INFRINGE THE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

RIGHTS OF OTHERS, REGARDLESS OF THE MERIT OR RESOLUTION OF SUCH

CLAIMS, COULD CAUSE US TO INCUR SIGNIFICANT COSTS IN RESPONDING

TO, DEFENDING, AND RESOLVING SUCH CLAIMS, AND MAY DIVERT THE

EFFORTS AND ATTENTION OF OUR MANAGEMENT AND TECHNICAL PERSONNEL

AWAY FROM OUR BUSINESS. AS A RESULT OF SUCH INTELLECTUAL

PROPERTY INFRINGEMENT CLAIMS, WE COULD BE REQUIRED OR OTHERWISE

DECIDE IT IS APPROPRIATE TO.



PAY THIRD-PARTY INFRINGEMENT CLAIMS;



DISCONTINUE MANUFACTURING, USING, OR SELLING PARTICULAR PRODUCTS

SUBJECT TO INFRINGEMENT CLAIMS;



DISCONTINUE USING THE TECHNOLOGY OR PROCESSES SUBJECT TO

INFRINGEMENT CLAIMS;



DEVELOP OTHER TECHNOLOGY NOT SUBJECT TO INFRINGEMENT CLAIMS,

WHICH COULD BE TIME-CONSUMING AND COSTLY OR MAY NOT BE POSSIBLE;

AND/OR



LICENSE TECHNOLOGY FROM THE THIRD PARTY CLAIMING INFRINGEMENT,

WHICH LICENSE MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE ON COMMERCIALLY REASONABLE

TERMS.

THE OCCURRENCE OF ANY OF THE FOREGOING COULD RESULT IN

UNEXPECTED EXPENSES OR REQUIRE US TO RECOGNIZE AN IMPAIRMENT OF

OUR ASSETS, WHICH WOULD REDUCE THE VALUE OF OUR ASSETS AND

INCREASE EXPENSES. IN ADDITION, IF WE ALTER OR DISCONTINUE OUR

PRODUCTION OF AFFECTED ITEMS, OUR REVENUE COULD BE NEGATIVELY

IMPACTED.

WE MAY

BE SUBJECT TO LITIGATION PROCEEDINGS THAT COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT

OUR BUSINESS.

IN ADDITION TO THE LITIGATION RISKS MENTIONED ABOVE, WE MAY BE

SUBJECT TO LEGAL CLAIMS OR REGULATORY MATTERS INVOLVING

STOCKHOLDER, CONSUMER, ANTITRUST, AND OTHER ISSUES. AS DESCRIBED

IN LEGAL PROCEEDINGS IN PART I, ITEM 3 OF THIS FORM

10-K,

WE ARE

CURRENTLY ENGAGED IN A NUMBER OF LITIGATION MATTERS. LITIGATION

IS SUBJECT TO INHERENT UNCERTAINTIES, AND UNFAVORABLE RULINGS

COULD OCCUR. AN UNFAVORABLE RULING COULD INCLUDE MONETARY

DAMAGES OR, IN CASES FOR WHICH INJUNCTIVE RELIEF IS SOUGHT, AN

INJUNCTION PROHIBITING INTEL FROM MANUFACTURING OR SELLING ONE

OR MORE PRODUCTS. WERE AN UNFAVORABLE RULING TO OCCUR, THERE

EXISTS THE POSSIBILITY OF A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON BUSINESS

AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE PERIOD IN WHICH THE RULING

OCCURRED OR FUTURE PERIODS.

WE MAY

NOT BE ABLE TO ENFORCE OR PROTECT OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

RIGHTS, WHICH MAY HARM OUR ABILITY TO COMPETE AND ADVERSELY

AFFECT OUR BUSINESS.

OUR ABILITY TO ENFORCE OUR PATENTS, COPYRIGHTS, SOFTWARE

LICENSES, AND OTHER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY IS SUBJECT TO GENERAL

LITIGATION RISKS, AS WELL AS UNCERTAINTY AS TO THE

ENFORCEABILITY OF OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS IN VARIOUS

COUNTRIES. WHEN WE SEEK TO ENFORCE OUR RIGHTS, WE ARE OFTEN

SUBJECT TO CLAIMS THAT THE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHT IS

INVALID, IS OTHERWISE NOT ENFORCEABLE, OR IS LICENSED TO THE

PARTY AGAINST WHOM WE ARE ASSERTING A CLAIM. IN ADDITION, OUR

ASSERTION OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS OFTEN RESULTS IN THE

OTHER PARTY SEEKING TO ASSERT ALLEGED INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

RIGHTS OF ITS OWN AGAINST US, WHICH MAY ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR

BUSINESS IN THE MANNER DISCUSSED ABOVE. IF WE ARE NOT ULTIMATELY

SUCCESSFUL IN DEFENDING OURSELVES AGAINST THESE CLAIMS IN

LITIGATION, WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO SELL A PARTICULAR PRODUCT OR

FAMILY OF PRODUCTS, DUE TO AN INJUNCTION, OR WE MAY HAVE TO PAY

MATERIAL AMOUNTS OF DAMAGES, WHICH COULD IN TURN NEGATIVELY

AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. IN ADDITION, GOVERNMENTS MAY

ADOPT REGULATIONS OR COURTS MAY RENDER DECISIONS REQUIRING

COMPULSORY LICENSING OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY TO OTHERS, OR

GOVERNMENTS MAY REQUIRE THAT PRODUCTS MEET SPECIFIED STANDARDS

THAT SERVE TO FAVOR LOCAL COMPANIES. OUR INABILITY TO ENFORCE

OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES MAY

NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR COMPETITIVE POSITION AND OUR BUSINESS.

OUR

LICENSES WITH OTHER COMPANIES AND OUR PARTICIPATION IN INDUSTRY

INITIATIVES MAY ALLOW OTHER COMPANIES, INCLUDING COMPETITORS, TO

USE OUR PATENT RIGHTS.

COMPANIES IN THE SEMICONDUCTOR INDUSTRY OFTEN RELY ON THE

ABILITY TO LICENSE PATENTS FROM EACH OTHER IN ORDER TO COMPETE.

MANY OF OUR COMPETITORS HAVE BROAD LICENSES OR CROSS-LICENSES

WITH US, AND UNDER CURRENT CASE LAW, SOME OF THESE LICENSES MAY

PERMIT THESE COMPETITORS TO PASS OUR PATENT RIGHTS ON TO OTHERS.

IF ONE OF THESE LICENSEES BECOMES A FOUNDRY, OUR COMPETITORS

MIGHT BE ABLE TO AVOID OUR PATENT RIGHTS IN MANUFACTURING

COMPETING PRODUCTS. IN ADDITION, OUR PARTICIPATION IN INDUSTRY

INITIATIVES MAY REQUIRE US TO LICENSE OUR PATENTS TO OTHER

COMPANIES THAT ADOPT CERTAIN INDUSTRY STANDARDS OR

SPECIFICATIONS, EVEN WHEN SUCH ORGANIZATIONS DO NOT ADOPT

STANDARDS OR SPECIFICATIONS PROPOSED BY US. AS A RESULT, OUR

PATENTS IMPLICATED BY OUR PARTICIPATION IN INDUSTRY INITIATIVES

MIGHT NOT BE AVAILABLE FOR US TO ENFORCE AGAINST OTHERS WHO

MIGHT OTHERWISE BE DEEMED TO BE INFRINGING THOSE PATENTS, OUR

COSTS OF ENFORCING OUR LICENSES OR PROTECTING OUR PATENTS MAY

INCREASE, AND THE VALUE OF OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY MAY BE

IMPAIRED.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

CHANGES

IN OUR DECISIONS WITH REGARD TO OUR ANNOUNCED RESTRUCTURING AND

EFFICIENCY PROJECT, AND OTHER FACTORS, COULD AFFECT OUR RESULTS

OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

FACTORS THAT COULD CAUSE ACTUAL RESULTS TO DIFFER MATERIALLY

FROM OUR EXPECTATIONS WITH REGARD TO OUR ANNOUNCED RESTRUCTURING

INCLUDE.



TIMING AND EXECUTION OF PLANS AND PROGRAMS THAT MAY BE SUBJECT

TO LOCAL LABOR LAW REQUIREMENTS, INCLUDING CONSULTATION WITH

APPROPRIATE WORKS COUNCILS;



ASSUMPTIONS RELATED TO SEVERANCE AND POST-RETIREMENT COSTS;



FUTURE ACQUISITIONS, DISPOSITIONS, OR INVESTMENTS;



NEW BUSINESS INITIATIVES AND CHANGES IN PRODUCT ROADMAP,

DEVELOPMENT, AND MANUFACTURING;



CHANGES IN EMPLOYMENT LEVELS AND TURNOVER RATES;



ASSUMPTIONS RELATED TO PRODUCT DEMAND AND THE BUSINESS

ENVIRONMENT; AND/OR



ASSUMPTIONS RELATED TO THE FAIR VALUE OF CERTAIN PROPERTY, PLANT

AND EQUIPMENT.

IN

ORDER TO COMPETE, WE MUST ATTRACT, RETAIN, AND MOTIVATE KEY

EMPLOYEES, AND OUR FAILURE TO DO SO COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT

ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

IN ORDER TO COMPETE, WE MUST ATTRACT, RETAIN, AND MOTIVATE

EXECUTIVES AND OTHER KEY EMPLOYEES, INCLUDING THOSE IN

MANAGERIAL, TECHNICAL, SALES, MARKETING, AND SUPPORT POSITIONS.

HIRING AND RETAINING QUALIFIED EXECUTIVES, SCIENTISTS,

ENGINEERS, TECHNICAL STAFF, AND SALES REPRESENTATIVES ARE

CRITICAL TO OUR BUSINESS, AND COMPETITION FOR EXPERIENCED

EMPLOYEES IN THE SEMICONDUCTOR INDUSTRY CAN BE INTENSE. TO HELP

ATTRACT, RETAIN, AND MOTIVATE QUALIFIED EMPLOYEES, WE USE

SHARE-BASED INCENTIVE AWARDS SUCH AS EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTIONS AND

NON-VESTED SHARE UNITS (RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS). IF THE VALUE OF

SUCH STOCK AWARDS DOES NOT APPRECIATE AS MEASURED BY THE

PERFORMANCE OF THE PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK

AND/OR

IF

OUR OTHER SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION OTHERWISE CEASES TO BE VIEWED

AS A VALUABLE BENEFIT, OUR ABILITY TO ATTRACT, RETAIN, AND

MOTIVATE EMPLOYEES COULD BE ADVERSELY IMPACTED, WHICH COULD

NEGATIVELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

OUR

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COULD VARY AS A RESULT OF THE METHODS,

ESTIMATES, AND JUDGMENTS WE USE IN APPLYING OUR ACCOUNTING

POLICIES.

THE METHODS, ESTIMATES, AND JUDGMENTS WE USE IN APPLYING OUR

ACCOUNTING POLICIES HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON OUR RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS (SEE CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES IN

PART II, ITEM 7 OF THIS FORM

10-K).

SUCH

METHODS, ESTIMATES, AND JUDGMENTS ARE, BY THEIR NATURE, SUBJECT

TO SUBSTANTIAL RISKS, UNCERTAINTIES, AND ASSUMPTIONS, AND

FACTORS MAY ARISE OVER TIME THAT LEAD US TO CHANGE OUR METHODS,

ESTIMATES, AND JUDGMENTS. CHANGES IN THOSE METHODS, ESTIMATES,

AND JUDGMENTS COULD SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS. IN PARTICULAR, THE CALCULATION OF SHARE-BASED

COMPENSATION EXPENSE UNDER STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING

STANDARDS (SFAS) NO. 123 (REVISED 2004), SHARE-BASED

PAYMENT (SFAS NO. 123(R)), REQUIRES US TO USE VALUATION

METHODOLOGIES (WHICH WERE NOT DEVELOPED FOR USE IN VALUING

EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTIONS AND RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS) AND A NUMBER

OF ASSUMPTIONS, ESTIMATES, AND CONCLUSIONS REGARDING MATTERS

SUCH AS EXPECTED FORFEITURES, EXPECTED VOLATILITY OF OUR SHARE

PRICE, THE EXPECTED DIVIDEND RATE WITH RESPECT TO OUR COMMON

STOCK, AND THE EXERCISE BEHAVIOR OF OUR EMPLOYEES. FURTHERMORE,

THERE ARE NO MEANS, UNDER APPLICABLE ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES, TO

COMPARE AND ADJUST OUR EXPENSE IF AND WHEN WE LEARN ABOUT

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION THAT MAY AFFECT THE ESTIMATES THAT WE

PREVIOUSLY MADE, WITH THE EXCEPTION OF CHANGES IN EXPECTED

FORFEITURES OF SHARE-BASED AWARDS. FACTORS MAY ARISE OVER TIME

THAT LEAD US TO CHANGE OUR ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS WITH

RESPECT TO FUTURE SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION ARRANGEMENTS,

RESULTING IN VARIABILITY IN OUR SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE

OVER TIME. CHANGES IN FORECASTED SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION

EXPENSE COULD IMPACT OUR GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE; RESEARCH AND

DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES; MARKETING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE

EXPENSES; AND OUR TAX RATE.

OUR

FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH APPLICABLE ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND

REGULATIONS WORLDWIDE COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR BUSINESS AND

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

THE MANUFACTURE AND ASSEMBLY AND TESTING OF OUR PRODUCTS REQUIRE

THE USE OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS THAT ARE SUBJECT TO A BROAD ARRAY

OF ENVIRONMENTAL, HEALTH, AND SAFETY LAWS AND REGULATIONS. OUR

FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH ANY OF THESE APPLICABLE LAWS OR

REGULATIONS COULD RESULT IN.



REGULATORY PENALTIES, FINES, AND LEGAL LIABILITIES;



SUSPENSION OF PRODUCTION;



ALTERATION OF OUR FABRICATION AND ASSEMBLY AND TEST PROCESSES;

AND/OR



CURTAILMENT OF OUR OPERATIONS OR SALES.

IN ADDITION, OUR FAILURE TO PROPERLY MANAGE THE USE,

TRANSPORTATION, EMISSION, DISCHARGE, STORAGE, RECYCLING, OR

DISPOSAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS COULD SUBJECT US TO INCREASED

COSTS OR FUTURE LIABILITIES. EXISTING AND FUTURE ENVIRONMENTAL

LAWS AND REGULATIONS COULD ALSO REQUIRE US TO ACQUIRE POLLUTION

ABATEMENT OR REMEDIATION EQUIPMENT, MODIFY OUR PRODUCT DESIGNS,

OR INCUR OTHER EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH SUCH LAWS AND

REGULATIONS. MANY NEW MATERIALS THAT WE ARE EVALUATING FOR USE

IN OUR OPERATIONS MAY BE SUBJECT TO REGULATION UNDER EXISTING OR

FUTURE ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS THAT MAY RESTRICT OUR

USE OF CERTAIN MATERIALS IN OUR MANUFACTURING, ASSEMBLY AND TEST

PROCESSES, OR PRODUCTS. ANY OF THESE CONSEQUENCES COULD

ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR BUSINESS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS BY

INCREASING OUR EXPENSES

AND/OR

REQUIRING US TO ALTER OUR MANUFACTURING AND ASSEMBLY AND TEST

PROCESSES.

19

TABLE OF CONTENTS

CHANGES

IN OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE MAY HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

OUR

FUTURE EFFECTIVE TAX RATES MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY A NUMBER

OF FACTORS INCLUDING.



THE JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH PROFITS ARE DETERMINED TO BE EARNED

AND TAXED;



THE RESOLUTION OF ISSUES ARISING FROM TAX AUDITS WITH VARIOUS

TAX AUTHORITIES;



CHANGES IN THE VALUATION OF OUR DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND

LIABILITIES;



ADJUSTMENTS TO ESTIMATED TAXES UPON FINALIZATION OF VARIOUS TAX

RETURNS;



INCREASES IN EXPENSES NOT DEDUCTIBLE FOR TAX PURPOSES, INCLUDING

WRITE-OFFS OF ACQUIRED IN-PROCESS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT AND

IMPAIRMENT OF GOODWILL IN CONNECTION WITH ACQUISITIONS;



CHANGES IN AVAILABLE TAX CREDITS;



CHANGES IN SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE;



CHANGES IN TAX LAWS OR THE INTERPRETATION OF SUCH TAX LAWS AND

CHANGES IN GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES; AND/OR



THE REPATRIATION OF

NON-U.S.

EARNINGS FOR WHICH WE HAVE NOT PREVIOUSLY PROVIDED FOR U.S.

TAXES.

ANY SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN OUR FUTURE EFFECTIVE TAX RATES COULD

ADVERSELY IMPACT NET INCOME FOR FUTURE PERIODS. IN ADDITION, THE

U.S. INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE (IRS) AND OTHER TAX AUTHORITIES

REGULARLY EXAMINE OUR INCOME TAX RETURNS. THE IRS HAS PROPOSED

ADJUSTMENTS OR ISSUED FORMAL ASSESSMENTS RELATED TO AMOUNTS

REFLECTED ON CERTAIN OF OUR TAX RETURNS AS A TAX BENEFIT FOR OUR

EXPORT SALES. SEE NOTE 19: CONTINGENCIES IN PART II,

ITEM 8 OF THIS FORM

10-K.

OUR

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COULD BE ADVERSELY IMPACTED IF THESE

ASSESSMENTS OR ANY OTHER ASSESSMENTS RESULTING FROM THE

EXAMINATION OF OUR INCOME TAX RETURNS BY THE IRS OR OTHER TAXING

AUTHORITIES ARE NOT RESOLVED IN OUR FAVOR.

WE

INVEST IN COMPANIES FOR STRATEGIC REASONS AND MAY NOT REALIZE A

RETURN ON OUR INVESTMENTS.

WE MAKE INVESTMENTS IN COMPANIES AROUND THE WORLD TO FURTHER OUR

STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES AND SUPPORT OUR KEY BUSINESS INITIATIVES.

SUCH INVESTMENTS INCLUDE INVESTMENTS IN EQUITY SECURITIES OF

PUBLIC COMPANIES AND INVESTMENTS IN NON-MARKETABLE EQUITY

SECURITIES OF PRIVATE COMPANIES, WHICH RANGE FROM EARLY-STAGE

COMPANIES THAT ARE OFTEN STILL DEFINING THEIR STRATEGIC

DIRECTION TO MORE MATURE COMPANIES WHOSE PRODUCTS OR

TECHNOLOGIES MAY DIRECTLY SUPPORT AN INTEL PRODUCT OR

INITIATIVE. THE SUCCESS OF THESE COMPANIES IS DEPENDENT ON

PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT, MARKET ACCEPTANCE, OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCY,

AND OTHER KEY BUSINESS SUCCESS FACTORS. THE PRIVATE COMPANIES IN

WHICH WE INVEST MAY FAIL BECAUSE THEY MAY NOT BE ABLE TO SECURE

ADDITIONAL FUNDING, OBTAIN FAVORABLE INVESTMENT TERMS FOR FUTURE

FINANCINGS, OR TAKE ADVANTAGE OF LIQUIDITY EVENTS SUCH AS

INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERINGS, MERGERS, AND PRIVATE SALES. IF ANY OF

THESE PRIVATE COMPANIES FAIL, WE COULD LOSE ALL OR PART OF OUR

INVESTMENT IN THAT COMPANY. IF WE DETERMINE THAT AN

OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY

DECLINE IN THE FAIR VALUE EXISTS FOR THE EQUITY SECURITIES OF

THE PUBLIC AND PRIVATE COMPANIES IN WHICH WE INVEST, WE WRITE

DOWN THE INVESTMENT TO ITS FAIR VALUE AND RECOGNIZE THE RELATED

WRITE-DOWN AS AN INVESTMENT LOSS. FURTHERMORE, WHEN THE

STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES OF AN INVESTMENT HAVE BEEN ACHIEVED, OR IF

THE INVESTMENT OR BUSINESS DIVERGES FROM OUR STRATEGIC

OBJECTIVES, WE MAY DECIDE TO DISPOSE OF THE INVESTMENT. OUR

INVESTMENTS IN NON-MARKETABLE EQUITY SECURITIES OF PRIVATE

COMPANIES ARE NOT LIQUID, AND WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO DISPOSE OF

THESE INVESTMENTS ON FAVORABLE TERMS OR AT ALL. THE OCCURRENCE

OF ANY OF THESE EVENTS COULD NEGATIVELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS.

ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

A.

TAX

MATTERS

IN CONNECTION WITH THE REGULAR EXAMINATION OF INTELS TAX

RETURNS FOR THE YEARS 1999 THROUGH 2005, THE IRS FORMALLY

ASSESSED, IN 2005 AND 2006, CERTAIN ADJUSTMENTS TO THE AMOUNTS

REFLECTED BY INTEL ON THOSE RETURNS AS A TAX BENEFIT FOR ITS

EXPORT SALES. THE COMPANY DOES NOT AGREE WITH THESE ADJUSTMENTS

AND HAS APPEALED THE ASSESSMENTS. IF THE IRS PREVAILS IN ITS

POSITION, INTELS FEDERAL INCOME TAX DUE FOR 1999 THROUGH

2005 WOULD INCREASE BY APPROXIMATELY $2.2 BILLION, PLUS

INTEREST. IN ADDITION, THE IRS WILL LIKELY MAKE A SIMILAR CLAIM

FOR 2006, AND IF THE IRS PREVAILS, INCOME TAX DUE FOR 2006 WOULD

INCREASE BY APPROXIMATELY $200 MILLION, PLUS INTEREST.

ALTHOUGH THE FINAL RESOLUTION OF THE ADJUSTMENTS IS UNCERTAIN,

BASED ON CURRENTLY AVAILABLE INFORMATION, MANAGEMENT BELIEVES

THAT THE ULTIMATE OUTCOME WILL NOT HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE

EFFECT ON THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL POSITION, CASH FLOWS, OR

OVERALL TRENDS IN RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. THERE IS THE

POSSIBILITY OF A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON THE RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS FOR THE PERIOD IN WHICH THE MATTER IS ULTIMATELY

RESOLVED, IF IT IS RESOLVED UNFAVORABLY, OR IN THE PERIOD IN

WHICH AN UNFAVORABLE OUTCOME BECOMES PROBABLE AND REASONABLY

ESTIMABLE.

IN THE AGGREGATE, WILL NOT HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR

FINANCIAL POSITION, CASH FLOWS, OR OVERALL TRENDS IN RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS, LITIGATION IS SUBJECT TO INHERENT UNCERTAINTIES, AND

UNFAVORABLE RULINGS COULD OCCUR. AN UNFAVORABLE RULING COULD

INCLUDE MONETARY DAMAGES OR, IN CASES FOR WHICH INJUNCTIVE

INTEL IS ALSO SUBJECT TO CERTAIN ANTITRUST REGULATORY INQUIRIES.

IN 2001, THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION COMMENCED AN INVESTIGATION

REGARDING CLAIMS BY AMD THAT INTEL USED UNFAIR BUSINESS

PRACTICES TO PERSUADE CLIENTS TO BUY INTEL MICROPROCESSORS. IN

JUNE 2005, INTEL RECEIVED AN INQUIRY FROM THE KOREA FAIR TRADE

COMMISSION REQUESTING DOCUMENTS FROM INTELS KOREAN

SUBSIDIARY RELATED TO MARKETING AND REBATE PROGRAMS THAT INTEL

ENTERED INTO WITH KOREAN PC MANUFACTURERS. INTEL IS COOPERATING

WITH THESE AGENCIES IN THEIR INVESTIGATIONS AND EXPECTS THAT

PROCESSORS AND A COMPETITORS MICROPROCESSORS. IN JULY

2004, THE COURT CERTIFIED AGAINST INTEL AN ILLINOIS-ONLY CLASS

OF CERTAIN END-USE PURCHASERS OF CERTAIN PENTIUM 4

PROCESSORS OR COMPUTERS CONTAINING SUCH MICROPROCESSORS. IN

JANUARY 2005, THE CIRCUIT COURT GRANTED A MOTION FILED JOINTLY

BY THE PLAINTIFFS AND INTEL THAT STAYED THE PROCEEDINGS IN THE

TRIAL COURT PENDING DISCRETIONARY APPELLATE REVIEW OF THE

CIRCUIT COURTS CLASS CERTIFICATION ORDER. IN JULY 2006,

THE ILLINOIS APPELLATE COURT, FIFTH DISTRICT, VACATED THE

CIRCUIT COURTS CLASS CERTIFICATION ORDER, AND REMANDED THE

CASE TO THE CIRCUIT COURT WITH INSTRUCTIONS TO RECONSIDER ITS

CLASS CERTIFICATION RULING. IN AUGUST 2006, THE ILLINOIS SUPREME

COURT AGREED TO REVIEW THE APPELLATE COURTS DECISION, AND

THAT REVIEW IS PENDING. THE PLAINTIFFS SEEK UNSPECIFIED DAMAGES,

AND ATTORNEYS FEES AND COSTS. THE COMPANY DISPUTES THE

PLAINTIFFS CLAIMS AND INTENDS TO DEFEND THE LAWSUIT

VIGOROUSLY.

AMBERWAVE SYSTEMS CORPORATION V. INTEL CORPORATION

UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE

BEGINNING IN MAY 2005, INTEL AND AMBERWAVE SYSTEMS CORPORATION

FILED A SERIES OF LAWSUITS AGAINST EACH OTHER THAT WERE

CONSOLIDATED INTO ACTIONS IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT

FOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE. AMBERWAVE CLAIMED THAT CERTAIN

INTEL SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING PROCESSES INFRINGED SIX

AMBERWAVE PATENTS RELATED TO SEMICONDUCTOR FABRICATION.

AMBERWAVE SOUGHT DAMAGES, TREBLE DAMAGES FOR ALLEGED WILLFUL

INFRINGEMENT, AN INJUNCTION, AND ATTORNEYS FEES. INTEL

DISPUTED AMBERWAVES ALLEGATIONS AND DEFENDED THE LAWSUITS

VIGOROUSLY. IN 2007, INTEL AND AMBERWAVE ENTERED INTO A LICENSE

AGREEMENT UNDER WHICH, AMONG OTHER TERMS, INTEL AGREED TO MAKE

CERTAIN PAYMENTS TO AMBERWAVE, AND AMBERWAVE AGREED TO LICENSE

AMBERWAVES PATENT PORTFOLIO TO INTEL. THE PARTIES AGREED

TO JOINTLY DISMISS THE ACTIONS WITH PREJUDICE.

TRANSMETA CORPORATION V. INTEL CORPORATION

UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE

IN OCTOBER 2006, TRANSMETA CORPORATION FILED A LAWSUIT IN THE

UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE.

TRANSMETA ALLEGES THAT INTELS P6, PENTIUM 4,

PENTIUM M, INTEL CORE, AND INTEL CORE 2 PROCESSORS

INFRINGE 10 TRANSMETA PATENTS ALLEGED TO COVER COMPUTER

ARCHITECTURE AND POWER-EFFICIENCY TECHNOLOGIES. IN DECEMBER

2006, TRANSMETA FILED AN AMENDED COMPLAINT ALLEGING THAT

INTELS PROCESSORS INFRINGE AN ELEVENTH TRANSMETA PATENT.

INTEL FILED COUNTERCLAIMS AGAINST TRANSMETA ALLEGING THAT

MANAGEMENTS

DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS

WE BEGIN MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL

CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (MD&A) BY DISCUSSING

INTELS OVERALL STRATEGY AND THE STRATEGY FOR OUR MAJOR

OPERATING SEGMENTS TO GIVE THE READER AN OVERVIEW OF THE GOALS

OF OUR BUSINESS AND THE DIRECTION IN WHICH OUR BUSINESS AND

PRODUCTS ARE MOVING. THE STRATEGY SECTION IS

FOLLOWED BY A DISCUSSION OF THE CRITICAL ACCOUNTING

ESTIMATES THAT WE BELIEVE ARE IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTANDING

THE ASSUMPTIONS AND JUDGMENTS INCORPORATED IN OUR REPORTED

FINANCIAL RESULTS. WE THEN DISCUSS OUR RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS BEGINNING WITH AN OVERVIEW,

FOLLOWED BY A COMPARISON OF 2006 TO 2005, AND 2005 TO 2004.

FOLLOWING THE ANALYSIS OF OUR RESULTS, WE PROVIDE AN ANALYSIS OF

CHANGES IN OUR BALANCE SHEETS AND CASH FLOWS, AND DISCUSS OUR

FINANCIAL CONDITION IN THE SECTION ENTITLED LIQUIDITY AND

CAPITAL RESOURCES FOLLOWED BY A DISCUSSION OF OUR

CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS, OFF-BALANCE-SHEET

ARRANGEMENTS, AND EQUITY INCENTIVE PLANS. WE

THEN CONCLUDE THIS MD&A WITH OUR BUSINESS

OUTLOOK SECTION, DISCUSSING OUR OUTLOOK FOR 2007.

THIS MD&A SHOULD BE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE OTHER

SECTIONS OF THIS FORM

10-K,

INCLUDING PART I, ITEM 1: BUSINESS; PART II,

ITEM 6: SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA; AND PART II,

ITEM 8: FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA.

THE VARIOUS SECTIONS OF THIS MD&A CONTAIN A NUMBER OF

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS. WORDS SUCH AS EXPECTS,

GOALS, PLANS, BELIEVES,

CONTINUES, MAY, AND VARIATIONS OF SUCH

WORDS AND SIMILAR EXPRESSIONS ARE INTENDED TO IDENTIFY SUCH

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS. IN ADDITION, ANY STATEMENTS THAT

REFER TO PROJECTIONS OF OUR FUTURE FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE, OUR

ANTICIPATED GROWTH AND TRENDS IN OUR BUSINESSES, AND OTHER

CHARACTERIZATIONS OF FUTURE EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES ARE

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS. SUCH STATEMENTS ARE BASED ON OUR

CURRENT EXPECTATIONS AND COULD BE AFFECTED BY THE UNCERTAINTIES

AND RISK FACTORS DESCRIBED THROUGHOUT THIS FILING AND

PARTICULARLY IN THE BUSINESS OUTLOOK SECTION (SEE

ALSO RISK FACTORS IN PART I, ITEM 1A OF THIS FORM

10-K).

OUR

ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER MATERIALLY, AND THESE FORWARD-LOOKING

STATEMENTS DO NOT REFLECT THE POTENTIAL IMPACT OF ANY

DIVESTITURES, MERGERS, ACQUISITIONS, OR OTHER BUSINESS

COMBINATIONS THAT HAD NOT BEEN COMPLETED AS OF FEBRUARY 21, 2007.

STRATEGY

OUR GOAL IS TO BE THE PREEMINENT PROVIDER OF SEMICONDUCTOR CHIPS

AND PLATFORM SOLUTIONS TO THE WORLDWIDE DIGITAL ECONOMY. AS PART

OF OUR OVERALL STRATEGY TO COMPETE IN EACH RELEVANT MARKET

SEGMENT, WE USE OUR CORE COMPETENCIES IN THE DESIGN AND

MANUFACTURE OF INTEGRATED CIRCUITS, AS WELL AS OUR FINANCIAL

RESOURCES, GLOBAL PRESENCE, AND BRAND RECOGNITION.

OUR STRATEGY FOCUSES ON TAKING CUSTOMER NEEDS INTO ACCOUNT IN

DEVELOPING THE NEXT GENERATION OF PRODUCTS AND PLATFORMS THAT

WILL ENABLE NEW FORM FACTORS AND NEW USAGE MODELS FOR BUSINESSES

AND CONSUMERS. WE BELIEVE THAT END USERS, OEMS, THIRD-PARTY

VENDORS, AND SERVICE PROVIDERS OF COMPUTING AND COMMUNICATIONS

SYSTEMS AND DEVICES WANT PLATFORM PRODUCTS. WE DEFINE A PLATFORM

AS A COLLECTION OF TECHNOLOGIES THAT ARE DESIGNED TO WORK

TOGETHER TO PROVIDE A BETTER END-USER SOLUTION THAN IF THE

INGREDIENTS WERE USED SEPARATELY. OUR PLATFORMS CONSIST OF

VARIOUS PRODUCTS BASED ON STANDARDS AND INITIATIVES; HARDWARE

AND SOFTWARE THAT MAY INCLUDE TECHNOLOGIES SUCH AS HT

TECHNOLOGY, INTEL VT, AND INTEL AMT; AND SERVICES. IN DEVELOPING

OUR PLATFORMS, WE MAY INCLUDE INGREDIENTS SOLD BY OTHER

COMPANIES. THE SUCCESS OF OUR STRATEGY TO OFFER PLATFORM

SOLUTIONS IS DEPENDENT ON OUR ABILITY TO SELECT AND INCORPORATE

INGREDIENTS THAT CUSTOMERS VALUE, AND TO MARKET THE PLATFORMS

EFFECTIVELY. WE HAVE A TIERED BRAND STRATEGY THAT ADDRESSES OUR

CUSTOMER NEEDS WITHIN VARIOUS MARKET PRICE POINTS.

WE ALSO BELIEVE THAT USERS OF COMPUTING AND COMMUNICATIONS

SYSTEMS AND DEVICES WANT IMPROVED OVERALL PERFORMANCE

AND/OR

IMPROVED ENERGY-EFFICIENT PERFORMANCE. IMPROVED OVERALL

PERFORMANCE CAN INCLUDE FASTER PROCESSING PERFORMANCE AND OTHER

IMPROVED CAPABILITIES SUCH AS MULTITHREADING AND MULTITASKING.

PERFORMANCE CAN ALSO BE IMPROVED THROUGH ENHANCED CONNECTIVITY,

SECURITY, MANAGEABILITY, UTILIZATION, RELIABILITY, EASE OF USE,

AND INTEROPERABILITY AMONG DEVICES. IMPROVED ENERGY-EFFICIENT

PERFORMANCE INVOLVES BALANCING THE ADDITION OF THESE TYPES OF

IMPROVED PERFORMANCE FACTORS WITH THE POWER CONSUMPTION OF THE

PLATFORM. LOWER POWER CONSUMPTION MAY REDUCE SYSTEM HEAT OUTPUT,

PROVIDE POWER SAVINGS, AND REDUCE THE TOTAL COST OF OWNERSHIP

FOR THE END USER. IT IS OUR GOAL TO INCORPORATE THESE

IMPROVEMENTS IN OUR VARIOUS PRODUCTS AND PLATFORMS TO MEET

END-USER DEMANDS. IN LINE WITH THESE EFFORTS, WE ARE FOCUSING ON

FURTHER DEVELOPMENT OF MULTI-CORE MICROPROCESSORS. MULTI-CORE

MICROPROCESSORS CONTAIN TWO OR MORE PROCESSOR CORES, WHICH

ENABLE IMPROVED MULTITASKING AND ENERGY-EFFICIENT PERFORMANCE.

OUR STRATEGY FOR DEVELOPING PROCESSORS WITH IMPROVED PERFORMANCE

IS TO SYNCHRONIZE THE INTRODUCTION OF NEW MICROARCHITECTURE WITH

IMPROVEMENTS IN SILICON PROCESS TECHNOLOGY. WE PLAN TO INTRODUCE

A NEW MICROARCHITECTURE APPROXIMATELY EVERY TWO YEARS AND RAMP

THE NEXT GENERATION OF SILICON PROCESS TECHNOLOGY IN THE

INTERVENING YEARS. THIS COORDINATED SCHEDULE ALLOWS US TO

DEVELOP AND INTRODUCE NEW PRODUCTS BASED ON A COMMON

MICROARCHITECTURE QUICKLY, WITHOUT WAITING FOR THE NEXT

GENERATION OF SILICON PROCESS TECHNOLOGY.

CRITICAL

ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

THE METHODS, ESTIMATES, AND JUDGMENTS WE USE IN APPLYING OUR

ACCOUNTING POLICIES HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE RESULTS WE

REPORT IN OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, WHICH WE DISCUSS UNDER THE

HEADING RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOLLOWING THIS SECTION

OF OUR MD&A. SOME OF OUR ACCOUNTING POLICIES REQUIRE US TO

MAKE DIFFICULT AND SUBJECTIVE JUDGMENTS, OFTEN AS A RESULT OF

THE NEED TO MAKE ESTIMATES OF MATTERS THAT ARE INHERENTLY

UNCERTAIN. OUR MOST CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES INCLUDE THE

VALUATION OF NON-MARKETABLE EQUITY SECURITIES, WHICH IMPACTS NET

GAINS (LOSSES) ON EQUITY SECURITIES WHEN WE RECORD IMPAIRMENTS;

THE RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT OF CURRENT AND DEFERRED INCOME

TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, WHICH IMPACT OUR TAX PROVISION; THE

ASSESSMENT OF RECOVERABILITY OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS, WHICH

PRIMARILY IMPACTS GROSS MARGIN OR OPERATING EXPENSES WHEN WE

RECORD ASSET IMPAIRMENTS OR ACCELERATE THEIR DEPRECIATION; THE

VALUATION OF INVENTORY, WHICH IMPACTS GROSS MARGIN; AND THE

VALUATION AND RECOGNITION OF SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION, WHICH

IMPACT GROSS MARGIN, RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES, AND

MARKETING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES. BELOW, WE

DISCUSS THESE POLICIES FURTHER, AS WELL AS THE ESTIMATES AND

JUDGMENTS INVOLVED. WE ALSO HAVE OTHER POLICIES THAT WE CONSIDER

KEY ACCOUNTING POLICIES, SUCH AS THOSE FOR REVENUE RECOGNITION,

INCLUDING THE DEFERRAL OF REVENUE ON SALES TO DISTRIBUTORS;

HOWEVER, THESE POLICIES TYPICALLY DO NOT REQUIRE US TO MAKE

ESTIMATES OR JUDGMENTS THAT ARE DIFFICULT OR SUBJECTIVE.

NON-MARKETABLE

EQUITY SECURITIES

WE TYPICALLY INVEST IN NON-MARKETABLE EQUITY SECURITIES OF

PRIVATE COMPANIES, WHICH RANGE FROM EARLY-STAGE COMPANIES THAT

ARE OFTEN STILL DEFINING THEIR STRATEGIC DIRECTION TO MORE

MATURE COMPANIES WHOSE PRODUCTS OR TECHNOLOGIES MAY DIRECTLY

SUPPORT AN INTEL PRODUCT OR INITIATIVE. AT DECEMBER 30, 2006,

THE CARRYING VALUE OF OUR PORTFOLIO OF STRATEGIC INVESTMENTS IN

NON-MARKETABLE EQUITY SECURITIES, EXCLUDING EQUITY DERIVATIVES,

TOTALED $2.8 BILLION ($561 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2005), WHICH

INCLUDES OUR INVESTMENTS IN IMFT AND CLEARWIRE.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

MANAGEMENTS

DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)

INVESTMENTS IN NON-MARKETABLE EQUITY SECURITIES ARE INHERENTLY

RISKY, AND A NUMBER OF THESE COMPANIES ARE LIKELY TO FAIL. THEIR

SUCCESS IS DEPENDENT ON PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT, MARKET ACCEPTANCE,

OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCY, AND OTHER KEY BUSINESS SUCCESS FACTORS.

IN ADDITION, DEPENDING ON THEIR FUTURE PROSPECTS AND MARKET

CONDITIONS, THEY MAY NOT BE ABLE TO RAISE ADDITIONAL FUNDS WHEN

NEEDED OR THEY MAY RECEIVE LOWER VALUATIONS, WITH LESS FAVORABLE

INVESTMENT TERMS THAN IN PREVIOUS FINANCINGS, AND THE

INVESTMENTS WOULD LIKELY BECOME IMPAIRED.

WE REVIEW OUR INVESTMENTS QUARTERLY FOR INDICATORS OF

IMPAIRMENT; HOWEVER, FOR NON-MARKETABLE EQUITY SECURITIES, THE

IMPAIRMENT ANALYSIS REQUIRES SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT TO IDENTIFY

EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES THAT WOULD LIKELY HAVE A SIGNIFICANT

ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE FAIR VALUE OF THE INVESTMENT. THE

INDICATORS THAT WE USE TO IDENTIFY THOSE EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES

INCLUDE (A) THE INVESTEES REVENUE AND EARNINGS TRENDS

RELATIVE TO PREDEFINED MILESTONES AND OVERALL BUSINESS

PROSPECTS; (B) THE TECHNOLOGICAL FEASIBILITY OF THE

INVESTEES PRODUCTS AND TECHNOLOGIES; (C) THE GENERAL

MARKET CONDITIONS IN THE INVESTEES INDUSTRY OR GEOGRAPHIC

AREA, INCLUDING ADVERSE REGULATORY OR ECONOMIC CHANGES; (D)

FACTORS RELATED TO THE INVESTEES ABILITY TO REMAIN IN

BUSINESS, SUCH AS THE INVESTEES LIQUIDITY, DEBT RATIOS,

AND THE RATE AT WHICH THE INVESTEE IS USING ITS CASH; AND (E)

THE INVESTEES RECEIPT OF ADDITIONAL FUNDING AT A LOWER

VALUATION.

INVESTMENTS IDENTIFIED AS HAVING AN INDICATOR OF IMPAIRMENT ARE

SUBJECT TO FURTHER ANALYSIS TO DETERMINE IF THE INVESTMENT IS

OTHER THAN TEMPORARILY IMPAIRED, IN WHICH CASE THE INVESTMENT IS

WRITTEN DOWN TO ITS IMPAIRED VALUE AND A NEW COST BASIS IS

ESTABLISHED. WHEN AN INVESTEE IS NOT CONSIDERED VIABLE FROM A

FINANCIAL OR TECHNOLOGICAL POINT OF VIEW, WE WRITE OFF THE

INVESTMENT, SINCE WE CONSIDER THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE TO BE

NOMINAL. IF AN INVESTEE OBTAINS ADDITIONAL FUNDING AT A

VALUATION LOWER THAN OUR CARRYING AMOUNT OR REQUIRES A NEW ROUND

OF EQUITY FUNDING TO STAY IN OPERATION AND THE NEW FUNDING DOES

NOT APPEAR IMMINENT, WE PRESUME THAT THE INVESTMENT IS OTHER

THAN TEMPORARILY IMPAIRED, UNLESS SPECIFIC FACTS AND

CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE OTHERWISE. IMPAIRMENTS OF INVESTMENTS IN

OUR PORTFOLIO OF NON-MARKETABLE EQUITY SECURITIES WERE $79

MILLION IN 2006 ($103 MILLION IN 2005 AND $115 MILLION IN 2004).

OVER THE PAST 12 QUARTERS, IMPAIRMENTS OF INVESTMENTS IN OUR

PORTFOLIO OF NON-MARKETABLE EQUITY SECURITIES HAVE RANGED

BETWEEN $10 MILLION AND $41 MILLION PER QUARTER.

INCOME

TAXES

WE MUST MAKE CERTAIN ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS IN DETERMINING

INCOME TAX EXPENSE FOR FINANCIAL STATEMENT PURPOSES. THESE

ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS OCCUR IN THE CALCULATION OF TAX CREDITS,

TAX BENEFITS, AND DEDUCTIONS, SUCH AS THE TAX BENEFIT FOR EXPORT

SALES, AND IN THE CALCULATION OF CERTAIN TAX ASSETS AND

LIABILITIES, WHICH ARISE FROM DIFFERENCES IN THE TIMING OF

RECOGNITION OF REVENUE AND EXPENSE FOR TAX AND FINANCIAL

STATEMENT PURPOSES. SIGNIFICANT CHANGES TO THESE ESTIMATES MAY

RESULT IN AN INCREASE OR DECREASE TO OUR TAX PROVISION IN A

SUBSEQUENT PERIOD.

WE MUST ASSESS THE LIKELIHOOD THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO RECOVER

OUR DEFERRED TAX ASSETS. IF RECOVERY IS NOT LIKELY, WE MUST

INCREASE OUR PROVISION FOR TAXES BY RECORDING A VALUATION

ALLOWANCE AGAINST THE DEFERRED TAX ASSETS THAT WE ESTIMATE WILL

NOT ULTIMATELY BE RECOVERABLE. WE BELIEVE THAT A SUBSTANTIAL

MAJORITY OF THE DEFERRED TAX ASSETS RECORDED ON OUR CONSOLIDATED

BALANCE SHEETS WILL ULTIMATELY BE RECOVERED. HOWEVER, SHOULD

THERE BE A CHANGE IN OUR ABILITY TO RECOVER OUR DEFERRED TAX

ASSETS, OUR TAX PROVISION WOULD INCREASE IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH

WE DETERMINED THAT THE RECOVERY WAS NOT PROBABLE.

IN ADDITION, THE CALCULATION OF OUR TAX LIABILITIES INVOLVES

DEALING WITH UNCERTAINTIES IN THE APPLICATION OF COMPLEX TAX

REGULATIONS. WE RECOGNIZE LIABILITIES FOR ANTICIPATED TAX AUDIT

ISSUES IN THE U.S. AND OTHER TAX JURISDICTIONS BASED ON OUR

ESTIMATE OF WHETHER, AND THE EXTENT TO WHICH, ADDITIONAL TAX

PAYMENTS ARE PROBABLE. IF WE ULTIMATELY DETERMINE THAT PAYMENT

OF THESE AMOUNTS IS UNNECESSARY, WE REVERSE THE LIABILITY AND

RECOGNIZE A TAX BENEFIT DURING THE PERIOD IN WHICH WE DETERMINE

THAT THE LIABILITY IS NO LONGER NECESSARY. THIS MAY OCCUR FOR A

VARIETY OF REASONS, SUCH AS THE EXPIRATION OF THE STATUTE OF

LIMITATIONS ON A PARTICULAR TAX RETURN OR THE SIGNING OF A FINAL

SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT WITH THE RELATIVE TAX AUTHORITY. WE RECORD

AN ADDITIONAL CHARGE IN OUR PROVISION FOR TAXES IN THE PERIOD IN

WHICH WE DETERMINE THAT THE RECORDED TAX LIABILITY IS LESS THAN

WE EXPECT THE ULTIMATE ASSESSMENT TO BE.

IN JUNE 2006, THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD (FASB)

ISSUED FASB INTERPRETATION NO. 48, ACCOUNTING FOR

UNCERTAINTY IN INCOME TAXESAN INTERPRETATION OF SFAS NO.

109. THE PROVISIONS ARE EFFECTIVE BEGINNING IN THE FIRST

QUARTER OF 2007. SEE NOTE 2: ACCOUNTING POLICIES IN

LONG-LIVED

ASSETS

WE ASSESS LONG-LIVED ASSETS FOR IMPAIRMENT WHEN EVENTS OR

CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THAT THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE

ASSETS OR THE ASSET GROUPING MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE. FACTORS

THAT WE CONSIDER IN DECIDING WHEN TO PERFORM AN IMPAIRMENT

REVIEW INCLUDE SIGNIFICANT UNDER-PERFORMANCE OF A BUSINESS OR

PRODUCT LINE IN RELATION TO EXPECTATIONS, SIGNIFICANT NEGATIVE

INDUSTRY OR ECONOMIC TRENDS, AND SIGNIFICANT CHANGES OR PLANNED

CHANGES IN OUR USE OF THE ASSETS. RECOVERABILITY OF ASSETS THAT

WILL CONTINUE TO BE USED IN OUR OPERATIONS IS MEASURED BY

COMPARING THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF THE ASSET GROUPING TO OUR

ESTIMATE OF THE RELATED TOTAL FUTURE UNDISCOUNTED NET CASH

FLOWS. IF AN ASSET GROUPINGS CARRYING VALUE IS NOT

RECOVERABLE THROUGH THE RELATED UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS, THE

ASSET GROUPING IS CONSIDERED TO BE IMPAIRED. THE IMPAIRMENT IS

MEASURED BY THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE ASSET GROUPINGS

CARRYING AMOUNT AND ITS FAIR VALUE.

IMPAIRMENTS OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS ARE DETERMINED FOR GROUPS OF

ASSETS RELATED TO THE LOWEST LEVEL OF IDENTIFIABLE INDEPENDENT

CASH FLOWS. DUE TO OUR ASSET USAGE MODEL AND THE INTERCHANGEABLE

NATURE OF OUR SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING CAPACITY, WE MUST MAKE

SUBJECTIVE JUDGMENTS IN DETERMINING THE INDEPENDENT CASH FLOWS

THAT CAN BE RELATED TO SPECIFIC ASSET GROUPINGS. IN ADDITION, AS

WE MAKE MANUFACTURING PROCESS CONVERSIONS AND OTHER FACTORY

PLANNING DECISIONS, WE MUST MAKE SUBJECTIVE JUDGMENTS REGARDING

THE REMAINING USEFUL LIVES OF ASSETS, PRIMARILY PROCESS-SPECIFIC

SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING TOOLS AND BUILDING IMPROVEMENTS.

WHEN WE DETERMINE THAT THE USEFUL LIVES OF ASSETS ARE SHORTER

THAN WE HAD ORIGINALLY ESTIMATED, AND THERE ARE SUFFICIENT CASH

FLOWS TO SUPPORT THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE ASSETS, WE ACCELERATE

THE RATE OF DEPRECIATION CHARGES IN ORDER TO FULLY DEPRECIATE

THE ASSETS OVER THEIR NEW SHORTER USEFUL LIVES. IMPAIRMENTS AND

ACCELERATED DEPRECIATION OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS WERE APPROXIMATELY

$335 MILLION DURING 2006 (APPROXIMATELY $20 MILLION IN 2005 AND

$50 MILLION IN 2004). THE AMOUNT IN 2006 INCLUDED $317 MILLION

OF ASSET IMPAIRMENT CHARGES RELATED TO OUR COMMUNICATIONS AND

APPLICATION PROCESSOR BUSINESS. FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION ON THESE

ASSET IMPAIRMENT CHARGES, SEE NOTE 11: RESTRUCTURING AND

ASSET IMPAIRMENT CHARGES IN PART II, ITEM 8 OF THIS FORM

10-K.

INVENTORY

THE VALUATION OF INVENTORY REQUIRES US TO ESTIMATE OBSOLETE OR

EXCESS INVENTORY AS WELL AS INVENTORY THAT IS NOT OF SALEABLE

QUALITY. THE DETERMINATION OF OBSOLETE OR EXCESS INVENTORY

REQUIRES US TO ESTIMATE THE FUTURE DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS.

DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2006, WE COMPLETED A DEMAND

FORECAST ACCURACY ANALYSIS. AS A RESULT, THE DEMAND HORIZON NOW

INCLUDES ADDITIONAL WEEKS OF THE DEMAND FORECAST PERIOD FOR

CERTAIN PRODUCTS, COMPARED TO PRIOR YEARS, AND CONTINUES TO

INCLUDE A REVIEW OF PRODUCT-SPECIFIC FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES.

THIS CHANGE DID NOT HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON GROSS MARGIN IN

2006. THE DEMAND FORECAST IS ALSO A DIRECT INPUT IN THE

DEVELOPMENT OF OUR SHORT-TERM MANUFACTURING PLANS, TO HELP

ENABLE CONSISTENCY BETWEEN INVENTORY VALUATION AND BUILD

DECISIONS. PRODUCT-SPECIFIC FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES REVIEWED IN

THE INVENTORY VALUATION PROCESS INCLUDE A REVIEW OF THE CUSTOMER

BASE, THE STAGE OF THE PRODUCT LIFE CYCLE OF OUR PRODUCTS,

CONSUMER CONFIDENCE, AND CUSTOMER ACCEPTANCE OF OUR PRODUCTS AS

WELL AS AN ASSESSMENT OF THE SELLING PRICE IN RELATION TO THE

PRODUCT COST. IF OUR DEMAND FORECAST FOR SPECIFIC PRODUCTS IS

GREATER THAN ACTUAL DEMAND AND WE FAIL TO REDUCE MANUFACTURING

OUTPUT ACCORDINGLY, OR IF WE FAIL TO ACCURATELY FORECAST THE

DEMAND, WE COULD BE REQUIRED TO WRITE DOWN ADDITIONAL INVENTORY,

WHICH WOULD HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON OUR GROSS MARGIN.

SHARE-BASED

COMPENSATION

IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2006, WE ADOPTED SFAS NO. 123(R), WHICH

REQUIRES THE MEASUREMENT AT FAIR VALUE AND RECOGNITION OF

COMPENSATION EXPENSE FOR ALL SHARE-BASED PAYMENT AWARDS. TOTAL

SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION DURING 2006 WAS $1.4 BILLION.

DETERMINING THE APPROPRIATE FAIR-VALUE MODEL AND CALCULATING THE

FAIR VALUE OF EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTIONS AND RIGHTS TO PURCHASE

SHARES UNDER STOCK PURCHASE PLANS AT THE DATE OF GRANT REQUIRES

JUDGMENT. WE USE THE BLACK-SCHOLES OPTION PRICING MODEL TO

ESTIMATE THE FAIR VALUE OF THESE SHARE-BASED AWARDS CONSISTENT

WITH THE PROVISIONS OF SFAS NO. 123(R). OPTION PRICING MODELS,

INCLUDING THE BLACK-SCHOLES MODEL, ALSO REQUIRE THE USE OF INPUT

ASSUMPTIONS, INCLUDING EXPECTED VOLATILITY, EXPECTED LIFE,

EXPECTED DIVIDEND RATE, AND EXPECTED RISK-FREE RATE OF RETURN.

THE ASSUMPTIONS FOR EXPECTED VOLATILITY AND EXPECTED LIFE ARE

THE TWO ASSUMPTIONS THAT SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT THE GRANT DATE

FAIR VALUE. THE EXPECTED DIVIDEND RATE AND EXPECTED RISK-FREE

RATE OF RETURN ARE NOT SIGNIFICANT TO THE CALCULATION OF FAIR

VALUE.

31

TABLE OF CONTENTS

MANAGEMENTS

DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)

WE USE IMPLIED VOLATILITY BASED ON OPTIONS FREELY TRADED IN THE

OPEN MARKET, AS WE BELIEVE IMPLIED VOLATILITY IS MORE REFLECTIVE

OF MARKET CONDITIONS AND A BETTER INDICATOR OF EXPECTED

VOLATILITY THAN HISTORICAL VOLATILITY. IN DETERMINING THE

APPROPRIATENESS OF IMPLIED VOLATILITY, WE CONSIDERED: THE VOLUME

OF MARKET ACTIVITY OF FREELY TRADED OPTIONS, AND DETERMINED THAT

THERE WAS SUFFICIENT MARKET ACTIVITY; THE ABILITY TO REASONABLY

MATCH THE INPUT VARIABLES OF OPTIONS FREELY TRADED TO THOSE OF

OPTIONS GRANTED BY THE COMPANY, SUCH AS THE DATE OF GRANT AND

THE EXERCISE PRICE, AND DETERMINED THAT THE INPUT ASSUMPTIONS

WERE COMPARABLE; AND THE LENGTH OF TERM OF FREELY TRADED OPTIONS

USED TO DERIVE IMPLIED VOLATILITY, WHICH IS GENERALLY ONE TO TWO

YEARS, AND DETERMINED THAT THE LENGTH OF TERM WAS SUFFICIENT. WE

USE THE SIMPLIFIED CALCULATION OF EXPECTED LIFE DESCRIBED IN THE

SECS STAFF ACCOUNTING BULLETIN 107, DUE TO CHANGES IN THE

VESTING TERMS AND CONTRACTUAL LIFE OF CURRENT OPTION GRANTS

COMPARED TO OUR HISTORICAL GRANTS. IF WE DETERMINED THAT ANOTHER

METHOD USED TO ESTIMATE EXPECTED VOLATILITY OR EXPECTED LIFE WAS

MORE REASONABLE THAN OUR CURRENT METHODS, OR IF ANOTHER METHOD

FOR CALCULATING THESE INPUT ASSUMPTIONS WAS PRESCRIBED BY

AUTHORITATIVE GUIDANCE, THE FAIR VALUE CALCULATED FOR

SHARE-BASED AWARDS COULD CHANGE SIGNIFICANTLY. HIGHER VOLATILITY

AND LONGER EXPECTED LIVES RESULT IN AN INCREASE TO SHARE-BASED

COMPENSATION DETERMINED AT THE DATE OF GRANT. THE EFFECT THAT

CHANGES IN THE VOLATILITY AND THE EXPECTED LIFE WOULD HAVE ON

THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE FAIR VALUE OF GRANTS AND THE INCREASE IN

TOTAL FAIR VALUE DURING 2006 WAS AS FOLLOWS.

FOR EXAMPLE, AN INCREASE FROM 27% REPORTED VOLATILITY FOR

2006 TO A HYPOTHETICAL 32% VOLATILITY.

IN ADDITION, SFAS NO. 123(R) REQUIRES US TO DEVELOP AN ESTIMATE

OF THE NUMBER OF SHARE-BASED AWARDS THAT WILL BE FORFEITED DUE

TO EMPLOYEE TURNOVER. QUARTERLY CHANGES IN THE ESTIMATED

FORFEITURE RATE CAN HAVE A SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON REPORTED

SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION, AS THE CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF ADJUSTING

THE RATE FOR ALL EXPENSE AMORTIZATION AFTER JANUARY 1, 2006 IS

RECOGNIZED IN THE PERIOD THE FORFEITURE ESTIMATE IS CHANGED. WE

ESTIMATE AND ADJUST FORFEITURE RATES BASED ON A QUARTERLY REVIEW

OF RECENT FORFEITURE ACTIVITY AND EXPECTED FUTURE EMPLOYEE

TURNOVER. IF A REVISED FORFEITURE RATE IS HIGHER THAN THE

PREVIOUSLY ESTIMATED FORFEITURE RATE, AN ADJUSTMENT IS MADE THAT

WILL RESULT IN A DECREASE TO THE EXPENSE RECOGNIZED IN THE

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. IF A REVISED FORFEITURE RATE IS LOWER THAN

THE PREVIOUSLY ESTIMATED FORFEITURE RATE, AN ADJUSTMENT IS MADE

THAT WILL RESULT IN AN INCREASE TO THE EXPENSE RECOGNIZED IN THE

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. THESE ADJUSTMENTS AFFECT OUR GROSS MARGIN;

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES; AND MARKETING, GENERAL AND

ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES. THE EFFECT OF FORFEITURE ADJUSTMENTS IN

2006 WAS INSIGNIFICANT. CUMULATIVE ADJUSTMENTS ARE RECORDED TO

THE EXTENT THAT THE RELATED EXPENSE IS RECOGNIZED IN THE

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, BEGINNING WITH IMPLEMENTATION IN THE FIRST

QUARTER OF 2006. THEREFORE, WE EXPECT THE POTENTIAL IMPACT FROM

CUMULATIVE FORFEITURE ADJUSTMENTS TO INCREASE IN FUTURE PERIODS.

THE EXPENSE THAT WE RECOGNIZE IN FUTURE PERIODS COULD ALSO

DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE CURRENT PERIOD

AND/OR

OUR

FORECASTS DUE TO ADJUSTMENTS IN THE ASSUMED FORFEITURE RATES.

RESULTS

OF OPERATIONS

OVERVIEW

FISCAL YEAR 2006 WAS A CHALLENGING YEAR DRIVEN BY A STRONG

COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT. LOWER MICROPROCESSOR AVERAGE SELLING

PRICES SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACTED OUR REVENUE AND GROSS MARGIN. OUR

GROSS MARGIN TOWARD THE END OF THE YEAR WAS ALSO IMPACTED BY

HIGHER UNIT COSTS RESULTING FROM THE RAMP OF DUAL-CORE

MICROPROCESSORS AND CHARGES FROM THE UNDER-UTILIZATION OF OUR

90-NANOMETER FACILITIES. FACTORY UNDER-UTILIZATION CHARGES ARE

EXPECTED TO CONTINUE TO IMPACT OUR GROSS MARGIN DURING THE FIRST

QUARTER OF 2007, AND

START-UP

COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR 45-NANOMETER PROCESS TECHNOLOGY ARE

EXPECTED TO IMPACT OUR GROSS MARGIN DURING THE FIRST HALF OF

2007. WE CONTINUED TO SEE A MIX SHIFT IN MICROPROCESSOR REVENUE

FROM DESKTOP TO MOBILE AND ENDED THE YEAR WITH FOURTH-QUARTER

MOBILE MICROPROCESSOR REVENUE SURPASSING DESKTOP MICROPROCESSOR

REVENUE FOR THE FIRST TIME. RESULTS FOR 2006 INCLUDED

SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION CHARGES OF $1.4 BILLION, GAINS ON

DIVESTITURES OF $612 MILLION, AND RESTRUCTURING AND ASSET

IMPAIRMENT CHARGES OF $555 MILLION.

DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)

OUR SPENDING IS TRENDING LOWER GOING INTO 2007 AS A RESULT OF

OUR ONGOING PROGRAM TO IMPROVE OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCY AND REDUCE

ONGOING COSTS ACROSS THE COMPANY. THROUGH ONGOING ATTRITION,

DIVESTITURES, AND EMPLOYEE TERMINATIONS, WE ENDED THE YEAR WITH

OUR EMPLOYEE HEADCOUNT AT 94,100, DOWN FROM 102,500 AT MID-YEAR,

AND EXPECT OUR HEADCOUNT TO CONTINUE TO DECLINE TO 92,000 BY THE

MIDDLE OF 2007. WE RECOGNIZED $238 MILLION IN RESTRUCTURING

CHARGES RELATED TO EMPLOYEE SEVERANCE AND BENEFIT ARRANGEMENTS.

IN ADDITION, WE HAVE TAKEN ACTIONS TO FOCUS ON OUR CORE

BUSINESSES AND HAVE COMPLETED THREE DIVESTITURES. WE RECOGNIZED

$103 MILLION IN TOOL IMPAIRMENTS ASSOCIATED WITH ONE OF THE

DIVESTITURES. IN ADDITION, WE HAVE PLACED FOR SALE A FABRICATION

FACILITY IN COLORADO THAT RESULTED IN AN IMPAIRMENT CHARGE OF

$214 MILLION. OVERALL, OUR ONGOING PROGRAM TO IMPROVE

OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCY AND RESULTS IS EXPECTED TO GENERATE COST

SAVINGS OF $2 BILLION IN 2007, AND $3 BILLION IN 2008,

OF WHICH AN ESTIMATED $600 MILLION IN GROSS ANNUAL SAVINGS

IS A RESULT OF CURRENT-YEAR RESTRUCTURING CHARGES RELATED TO

EMPLOYEE SEVERANCE AND BENEFIT ARRANGEMENTS. A PORTION OF THE

OVERALL COST SAVINGS, SUCH AS BETTER UTILIZATION OF ASSETS,

REDUCED SPENDING, AND ORGANIZATIONAL EFFICIENCIES, WILL NOT

RESULT IN RESTRUCTURING CHARGES.

OUTSTANDING NEW PRODUCTS, LEADERSHIP IN MANUFACTURING

TECHNOLOGY, COMPREHENSIVE COST SAVINGS, AND DISCIPLINED

EXECUTION HAVE BUILT A FOUNDATION FOR 2007. WE CONTINUE TO DRIVE

TECHNOLOGY ADVANCEMENTS, AND IN 2006 WE RAMPED OUR

65-NANOMETER

PROCESS TECHNOLOGY, INTRODUCED THE INTEL CORE MICROARCHITECTURE,

AND ENDED THE YEAR WITH DUAL-CORE MICROPROCESSORS ACCOUNTING FOR

OVER HALF OF OUR FOURTH-QUARTER SHIPMENTS. ADDITIONALLY, IN THE

FOURTH QUARTER, WE BEGAN SHIPPING QUAD-CORE MICROPROCESSORS.

LOOKING FORWARD TO 2007, WE EXPECT TO LAUNCH OUR NEXT GENERATION

OF INTEL CENTRINO MOBILE TECHNOLOGY LATER IN THE FIRST HALF OF

2007, AND MICROPROCESSORS USING

45-NANOMETER

PROCESS TECHNOLOGY ARE SCHEDULED FOR PRODUCTION IN THE SECOND

HALF OF 2007.

FROM A FINANCIAL CONDITION PERSPECTIVE, WE ENDED THE YEAR WITH

$8.9 BILLION IN CASH AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS, AND RETURNED

$4.6 BILLION TO STOCKHOLDERS THROUGH STOCK REPURCHASES AND

$2.3 BILLION AS DIVIDENDS IN 2006.

OUR NET REVENUE WAS $35.4 BILLION IN 2006, A DECREASE OF 9%

COMPARED TO 2005. SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE DECREASE WAS DUE TO

SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER AVERAGE SELLING PRICES OF MICROPROCESSORS.

FISCAL YEAR 2006 WAS A

52-WEEK

FISCAL YEAR IN CONTRAST TO FISCAL YEAR 2005, WHICH WAS A

53-WEEK

FISCAL YEAR.

REVENUE IN THE ASIA-PACIFIC REGION DECREASED 10% AND REVENUE IN

THE EUROPE REGION DECREASED 20% COMPARED TO 2005. THESE

DECREASES WERE SLIGHTLY OFFSET BY REVENUE IN JAPAN, WHICH

INCREASED SLIGHTLY COMPARED TO 2005. REVENUE IN THE AMERICAS

REGION WAS APPROXIMATELY FLAT COMPARED TO 2005. MATURE AND

EMERGING MARKETS BOTH DECLINED IN 2006 COMPARED TO 2005. THE

DECREASE WITHIN MATURE MARKETS OCCURRED IN THE EUROPE AND

ASIA-PACIFIC REGIONS, AND A SUBSTANTIAL MAJORITY OF THE DECREASE

WITHIN THE EMERGING MARKETS OCCURRED IN THE EUROPE AND

ASIA-PACIFIC REGIONS.

OUR OVERALL GROSS MARGIN DOLLARS FOR 2006 WERE $18.2 BILLION, A

DECREASE OF $4.8 BILLION, OR 21%, COMPARED TO 2005. OUR OVERALL

GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE DECREASED TO 51.5% IN 2006 FROM 59.4% IN

2005. THE GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE FOR THE DIGITAL ENTERPRISE

GROUP AND THE MOBILITY GROUP WERE BOTH LOWER IN 2006 COMPARED TO

2005. A MIX SHIFT OF OUR TOTAL REVENUE TO THE MOBILITY GROUP,

WHICH HAS A HIGHER GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE, SLIGHTLY OFFSET

THESE DECREASES TO THE OVERALL GROSS MARGIN. A SUBSTANTIAL

MAJORITY OF OUR OVERALL GROSS MARGIN DOLLARS IN 2006 AND 2005

WAS DERIVED FROM THE SALE OF MICROPROCESSORS. THE 2006 GROSS

MARGIN INCLUDED THE IMPACT OF $349 MILLION OF SHARE-BASED

COMPENSATION, WHICH WE BEGAN RECOGNIZING IN 2006. THE 2005 GROSS

MARGIN WAS AFFECTED BY A LITIGATION SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT WITH

MICROUNITY, INC. IN WHICH WE RECORDED A $140 MILLION CHARGE TO

COST OF SALES, OF WHICH $110 MILLION WAS ALLOCATED TO THE

DIGITAL ENTERPRISE GROUP AND $30 MILLION WAS ALLOCATED TO THE

MOBILITY GROUP. SEE BUSINESS OUTLOOK LATER IN THIS

SECTION FOR A DISCUSSION OF GROSS MARGIN EXPECTATIONS.

OUR NET REVENUE FOR 2005 WAS $38.8 BILLION, AN INCREASE OF $4.6

BILLION, OR 13.5%, COMPARED TO 2004. THIS INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY

DUE TO HIGHER REVENUE FROM SALES OF MOBILE MICROPROCESSORS AND

HIGHER CHIPSET REVENUE. FISCAL YEAR 2005 WAS A

53-WEEK

FISCAL YEAR IN CONTRAST TO FISCAL YEAR 2004, WHICH WAS A

52-WEEK

FISCAL YEAR.

IN 2005, THE ASIA-PACIFIC REGIONS REVENUE WAS

APPROXIMATELY 50% OF OUR TOTAL REVENUE, AND IT WAS OUR FASTEST

GROWING REGION, INCREASING 26% COMPARED TO 2004 AND REFLECTING

THE MOVEMENT OF MORE OF OUR CUSTOMERS PC SUPPLY CHAINS TO

ASIA. THIS MOVEMENT IN THE SUPPLY CHAIN NEGATIVELY AFFECTED OUR

SALES IN THE AMERICAS REGION, WHICH DECREASED 5% COMPARED TO

2004. JAPAN REVENUE INCREASED 19% AND EUROPE REVENUE INCREASED

6% DURING 2005 COMPARED TO 2004. WE SAW GROWTH IN BOTH MATURE

AND EMERGING MARKETS IN 2005 COMPARED TO 2004.

OVERALL GROSS MARGIN DOLLARS FOR 2005 WERE $23.0 BILLION, AN

INCREASE OF $3.3 BILLION, OR 17%, COMPARED TO 2004. OUR OVERALL

GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE INCREASED TO 59.4% IN 2005 FROM 57.7% IN

2004. THE OVERALL GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE WAS POSITIVELY

AFFECTED BY A MIX SHIFT OF OUR TOTAL REVENUE TO THE MOBILITY

GROUP, WHICH HAS A HIGHER GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE. THE GROSS

MARGIN PERCENTAGES FOR THE DIGITAL ENTERPRISE GROUP AND FLASH

MEMORY GROUP WERE HIGHER AND THE GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE FOR THE

MOBILITY GROUP WAS LOWER IN 2005 COMPARED TO 2004. A SUBSTANTIAL

MAJORITY OF OUR OVERALL GROSS MARGIN DOLLARS IN 2005 AND 2004

WAS DERIVED FROM THE SALE OF MICROPROCESSORS. AS A RESULT OF A

LITIGATION SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT WITH MICROUNITY, WE RECORDED A

$140 MILLION CHARGE TO COST OF SALES IN 2005, OF WHICH $110

MILLION WAS ALLOCATED TO THE DIGITAL ENTERPRISE GROUP AND $30

MILLION WAS ALLOCATED TO THE MOBILITY GROUP. THE 2004 GROSS

MARGIN WAS AFFECTED BY A LITIGATION SETTLEMENT WITH INTERGRAPH

NET REVENUE FOR THE DEG OPERATING SEGMENT DECREASED

SIGNIFICANTLY, BY $5.3 BILLION, OR 21%, IN 2006 COMPARED TO

2005. THE DECLINE IN NET REVENUE WAS MOSTLY DUE TO A SIGNIFICANT

DECLINE IN MICROPROCESSOR REVENUE, AND TO A LESSER EXTENT, A

DECLINE IN CHIPSET, MOTHERBOARD, AND OTHER REVENUE. THE

SIGNIFICANT DECLINE IN MICROPROCESSOR REVENUE WAS DUE TO LOWER

AVERAGE SELLING PRICES AND UNIT SALES OF DESKTOP

MICROPROCESSORS. ENTERPRISE MICROPROCESSOR REVENUE INCREASED IN

2006. THE DECLINE IN CHIPSET, MOTHERBOARD, AND OTHER REVENUE WAS

DUE EQUALLY TO LOWER CHIPSET REVENUE AND MOTHERBOARD REVENUE.

MICROPROCESSORS WITHIN DEG INCLUDE MICROPROCESSORS DESIGNED FOR

THE DESKTOP AND ENTERPRISE COMPUTING MARKET SEGMENTS, PREVIOUSLY

INCLUDED WITHIN THE FORMER INTEL ARCHITECTURE BUSINESS OPERATING

SEGMENT, AS WELL AS EMBEDDED MICROPROCESSORS. REVENUE FROM

NETWORK PROCESSORS, WHICH ARE BASED ON OUR INTEL XSCALE

TECHNOLOGY, IS INCLUDED IN CHIPSET, MOTHERBOARD, AND OTHER

REVENUE ABOVE.

OPERATING INCOME DECREASED SIGNIFICANTLY BY $4.8 BILLION, OR

53%, IN 2006 COMPARED TO 2005. SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE DECREASE

WAS DUE TO THE REVENUE DECLINE. HIGHER MICROPROCESSOR UNIT

COSTS, ALONG WITH $210 MILLION OF HIGHER FACTORY

UNDER-UTILIZATION CHARGES, WERE OFFSET BY APPROXIMATELY $540

MILLION OF LOWER

START-UP

COSTS. UNIT COSTS WERE HIGHER IN 2006 COMPARED TO 2005 DUE

PRIMARILY TO A MIX SHIFT TO DUAL-CORE MICROPROCESSORS. RESULTS

FOR 2005 INCLUDED A CHARGE RELATED TO A SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT

WITH MICROUNITY.

FOR 2005, REVENUE FOR THE DEG OPERATING SEGMENT WAS

APPROXIMATELY FLAT COMPARED TO 2004. REVENUE FROM SALES OF

MICROPROCESSORS WAS APPROXIMATELY FLAT, WITH SLIGHTLY HIGHER

UNIT SALES BEING OFFSET BY SLIGHTLY LOWER AVERAGE SELLING

PRICES. REVENUE FROM SALES OF SERVER MICROPROCESSORS IN 2005 WAS

NEGATIVELY AFFECTED BY THE HIGHLY COMPETITIVE SERVER MARKET.

CHIPSET, MOTHERBOARD, AND OTHER REVENUE WAS HIGHER, PRIMARILY

DUE TO HIGHER AVERAGE SELLING PRICES OF CHIPSETS.

OPERATING INCOME WAS ALSO APPROXIMATELY FLAT, AT $9.0 BILLION IN

2005 COMPARED TO $8.9 BILLION IN 2004. THE OPERATING INCOME FOR

DEG WAS POSITIVELY AFFECTED BY LOWER MICROPROCESSOR UNIT COSTS

AND HIGHER CHIPSET REVENUE. THESE IMPROVEMENTS WERE OFFSET BY

APPROXIMATELY $380 MILLION OF HIGHER

START-UP

COSTS IN 2005, PRIMARILY RELATED TO OUR 65-NANOMETER PROCESS

TECHNOLOGY. PRODUCTS BASED ON OUR

65-NANOMETER

PROCESS TECHNOLOGY BEGAN SHIPPING IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2005.

ALTHOUGH REVENUE WAS FLAT, OPERATING EXPENSES INCREASED IN 2005,

WHICH NEGATIVELY AFFECTED OPERATING INCOME. BOTH PERIODS WERE

NEGATIVELY AFFECTED BY LITIGATION SETTLEMENT AGREEMENTS. RESULTS

FOR 2005 INCLUDED A CHARGE RELATED TO A SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT

WITH MICROUNITY, AND RESULTS FOR 2004 INCLUDED A CHARGE RELATED

TO A SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT WITH INTERGRAPH.

2005, WHILE CHIPSETS AND OTHER REVENUE INCREASED BY $670

MILLION, OR 28%, IN 2006 COMPARED TO 2005. THE INCREASE IN

MICROPROCESSOR REVENUE WAS DUE TO HIGHER UNIT SALES, LARGELY

OFFSET BY LOWER AVERAGE SELLING PRICES. THE MAJORITY OF THE

INCREASE IN CHIPSET AND OTHER REVENUE WAS DUE TO HIGHER REVENUE

FROM SALES OF CHIPSETS, AND TO A LESSER EXTENT, HIGHER REVENUE

FROM SALES OF WIRELESS CONNECTIVITY PRODUCTS. SALES OF THESE

PRODUCTS INCREASED PRIMARILY DUE TO THE INTEL CENTRINO DUO

MOBILE TECHNOLOGY PLATFORM. REVENUE FROM APPLICATION AND

CELLULAR BASEBAND PROCESSORS IS INCLUDED IN CHIPSET AND

OTHER REVENUE ABOVE. IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2006, WE

DIVESTED CERTAIN ASSETS OF THE BUSINESS LINE THAT INCLUDED

APPLICATION AND CELLULAR BASEBAND PROCESSORS USED IN HANDHELD

IN PART II, ITEM 8 OF THIS FORM

OPERATING INCOME DECREASED BY $341 MILLION, OR 6%, IN 2006

COMPARED TO 2005. THE DECLINE WAS PRIMARILY CAUSED BY HIGHER

OPERATING EXPENSES. THE EFFECTS OF HIGHER REVENUE WERE OFFSET BY

HIGHER UNIT COSTS FOR MICROPROCESSORS.

START-UP

COSTS WERE APPROXIMATELY $170 MILLION LOWER IN 2006 COMPARED TO

2005.

FOR 2005, REVENUE FOR THE MG OPERATING SEGMENT INCREASED BY

$4.15 BILLION, OR 59%, COMPARED TO 2004. THIS INCREASE WAS

PRIMARILY DUE TO SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER REVENUE FROM SALES OF

MICROPROCESSORS, WHICH INCREASED $3.0 BILLION, OR 54%, IN 2005

COMPARED TO 2004, REFLECTING THE CONTINUED GROWTH IN THE

NOTEBOOK MARKET SEGMENT. INCREASED USE OF MICROPROCESSORS

DESIGNED SPECIFICALLY FOR MOBILE PLATFORMS IN NOTEBOOK COMPUTERS

ALSO CONTRIBUTED TO THE HIGHER REVENUE. THE HIGHER REVENUE FROM

SALES OF MICROPROCESSORS WAS DUE TO SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER UNIT

SALES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER AVERAGE SELLING PRICES,

PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER UNIT SALES OF THE CELERON M PROCESSOR,

OUR VALUE MOBILE PROCESSOR. REVENUE FROM SALES OF CHIPSETS AND

WIRELESS CONNECTIVITY PRODUCTS ALSO INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY IN

2005 COMPARED TO 2004, PRIMARILY DUE TO THE SUCCESS OF INTEL

CENTRINO MOBILE TECHNOLOGY.

OPERATING INCOME INCREASED TO $5.3 BILLION IN 2005 FROM $2.8

BILLION IN 2004. THE SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN OPERATING INCOME

WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER REVENUE. IN ADDITION, OPERATING

EXPENSES FOR THE MG OPERATING SEGMENT DID NOT INCREASE AS FAST

AS REVENUE, AND MICROPROCESSOR UNIT COSTS WERE LOWER. THESE

INCREASES IN OPERATING INCOME WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY

APPROXIMATELY $170 MILLION OF HIGHER

START-UP

COSTS IN 2005, PRIMARILY RELATED TO OUR 65-NANOMETER PROCESS

FLASH MEMORY PRODUCTS MANUFACTURED BY IMFT. OPERATING LOSS

INCREASED TO $555 MILLION IN 2006, FROM $154 MILLION IN 2005.

THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER COSTS RELATED TO OUR

OFFSETTING THESE INCREASES WERE LOWER MARKETING PROGRAM SPENDING

AND LOWER PROFIT-DEPENDENT COMPENSATION EXPENSES. THE INCREASE

IN 2005 COMPARED TO 2004 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER MARKETING

RESTRUCTURING AND ASSET IMPAIRMENT CHARGES.

WE ARE

UNDERTAKING A RESTRUCTURING PLAN DESIGNED TO IMPROVE OPERATIONAL

EFFICIENCY AND FINANCIAL RESULTS. IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2006,

MANAGEMENT APPROVED SEVERAL ACTIONS RELATED TO THIS PLAN THAT

WERE RECOMMENDED BY THE COMPANYS STRUCTURE AND EFFICIENCY

TASK FORCE. A PORTION OF THESE ACTIVITIES INVOLVES COST SAVINGS

OR OTHER ACTIONS THAT DO NOT RESULT IN RESTRUCTURING CHARGES,

SUCH AS BETTER UTILIZATION OF ASSETS, REDUCED SPENDING, AND

ORGANIZATIONAL EFFICIENCIES. THE EFFICIENCY PROGRAM INCLUDES

HEADCOUNT TARGETS FOR VARIOUS GROUPS WITHIN THE COMPANY, AND WE

EXPECT THESE TARGETS TO BE MET THROUGH ONGOING EMPLOYEE

ATTRITION, DIVESTITURES, AND EMPLOYEE TERMINATIONS.

DURING 2006, WE INCURRED $238 MILLION OF RESTRUCTURING CHARGES

RELATED TO EMPLOYEE SEVERANCE AND BENEFIT ARRANGEMENTS FOR

APPROXIMATELY 4,800 EMPLOYEES, OF WHICH APPROXIMATELY 4,100

EMPLOYEES HAD LEFT THE COMPANY AS OF DECEMBER 30, 2006. A

SUBSTANTIAL MAJORITY OF THESE EMPLOYEE TERMINATIONS OCCURRED

WITHIN MARKETING, MANUFACTURING, INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY, AND

HUMAN RESOURCES. ADDITIONALLY, WE COMPLETED THE DIVESTITURE OF

THE ASSETS OF THREE BUSINESSES IN 2006 CONCURRENTLY WITH THE

ONGOING EXECUTION OF THE EFFICIENCY PROGRAM. SEE NOTE 14.

ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES IN PART II, ITEM 8 OF THIS

FORM

10-K

FOR FURTHER DETAILS. IN CONNECTION WITH THE DIVESTITURE OF

CERTAIN ASSETS OF THE COMMUNICATIONS AND APPLICATION PROCESSOR

BUSINESS, WE RECORDED IMPAIRMENT CHARGES OF $103 MILLION RELATED

TO THE WRITE-DOWN OF MANUFACTURING TOOLS TO THEIR FAIR VALUE,

LESS THE COST TO DISPOSE OF THE ASSETS. THE FAIR VALUE WAS

DETERMINED USING A MARKET-BASED VALUATION TECHNIQUE. IN

ADDITION, AS A RESULT OF BOTH THIS DIVESTITURE AND A SUBSEQUENT

ASSESSMENT OF OUR WORLDWIDE MANUFACTURING CAPACITY OPERATIONS,

MANAGEMENT PLACED FOR SALE ITS FABRICATION FACILITY IN COLORADO

SPRINGS, COLORADO. THIS PLAN RESULTED IN AN IMPAIRMENT CHARGE OF

$214 MILLION TO WRITE DOWN TO FAIR VALUE THE LAND, BUILDING, AND

EQUIPMENT ASSET GROUPING THAT HAS BEEN PRINCIPALLY USED TO

SUPPORT THE COMMUNICATIONS AND APPLICATION PROCESSOR BUSINESS.

THE FAIR MARKET VALUE OF THE ASSET GROUPING WAS DETERMINED USING

VARIOUS VALUATION TECHNIQUES.

THE RESTRUCTURING AND ASSET IMPAIRMENT CHARGES ABOVE HAVE BEEN

REFLECTED SEPARATELY AS RESTRUCTURING AND ASSET IMPAIRMENT

CHARGES ON THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME. THE

RESTRUCTURING ACCRUAL BALANCE RELATES TO SEVERANCE BENEFITS THAT

ARE EXPECTED TO BE PAID WITHIN THE NEXT 12 MONTHS. AS SUCH, THE

RESTRUCTURING ACCRUAL IS RECORDED AS A CURRENT LIABILITY WITHIN

ACCRUED COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE

SHEETS. NO RESTRUCTURING CHARGES WERE INCURRED IN 2005 OR 2004.

WE EXPECT TO RECORD ADDITIONAL EMPLOYEE SEVERANCE AND BENEFIT

CHARGES OF APPROXIMATELY $50 MILLION IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF

2007. IN ADDITION, WE MAY INCUR CHARGES IN THE FUTURE UNDER THIS

RESTRUCTURING FOR FACILITY-RELATED OR OTHER EXIT ACTIVITIES.

WE ESTIMATE THAT THE CURRENT-YEAR EMPLOYEE SEVERANCE AND BENEFIT

CHARGES WILL RESULT IN GROSS ANNUAL SAVINGS OF APPROXIMATELY

$600 MILLION. WE EXPECT THESE SAVINGS TO BE REALIZED IN

APPROXIMATELY EQUAL AMOUNTS WITHIN COST OF SALES; RESEARCH AND

DEVELOPMENT; AND MARKETING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES.

AMORTIZATION OF ACQUISITION-RELATED INTANGIBLES

AND COSTS WAS $42 MILLION IN 2006 ($126 MILLION IN 2005 AND $179

MILLION IN 2004). THE DECREASED AMORTIZATION EACH YEAR COMPARED

TO THE PREVIOUS YEAR WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO A PORTION OF THE

INTANGIBLES RELATED TO PRIOR ACQUISITIONS BECOMING FULLY

AMORTIZED.

DURING 2006, THE GAINS ON EQUITY SECURITIES OF $293 MILLION

INCLUDED THE GAIN OF $103 MILLION ON THE SALE OF A PORTION OF

OUR INVESTMENT IN MICRON, WHICH WAS SOLD FOR $275 MILLION.

DURING 2005, IMPAIRMENT CHARGES OF $208 MILLION INCLUDED A $105

MILLION IMPAIRMENT CHARGE ON OUR INVESTMENT IN MICRON. THE

IMPAIRMENT WAS PRINCIPALLY BASED ON OUR ASSESSMENT DURING THE

SECOND QUARTER OF 2005 OF MICRONS FINANCIAL RESULTS AND

THE FACT THAT THE MARKET PRICE OF MICRONS STOCK HAD BEEN

BELOW OUR COST BASIS FOR AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF TIME, AS WELL AS

THE COMPETITIVE PRICING ENVIRONMENT FOR DRAM PRODUCTS. DURING

2004, THE NET LOSSES ON EQUITY SECURITIES OF $2 MILLION INCLUDED

IMPAIRMENTS OF $117 MILLION, PRIMARILY ON NON-MARKETABLE

EQUITY SECURITIES.

INTEREST AND OTHER, NET INCREASED TO $1.2 BILLION IN 2006

COMPARED TO $565 MILLION IN 2005, REFLECTING NET GAINS OF $612

MILLION FOR THREE COMPLETED DIVESTITURES (SEE NOTE 14.

ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES IN PART II, ITEM 8 OF THIS

FORM

10-K)

AND HIGHER INTEREST INCOME AS A RESULT OF HIGHER INTEREST RATES,

PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER CASH BALANCES. INTEREST AND OTHER, NET

INCREASED TO $565 MILLION IN 2005 COMPARED TO $289 MILLION IN

2004, REFLECTING HIGHER INTEREST INCOME AS A RESULT OF HIGHER

INTEREST RATES. INTEREST AND OTHER, NET FOR 2004 ALSO INCLUDED

APPROXIMATELY $60 MILLION OF GAINS ASSOCIATED WITH TERMINATING

FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS FOR MANUFACTURING FACILITIES AND

EQUIPMENT IN IRELAND.

OUR EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE WAS 28.6% IN 2006 (31.3% IN 2005

AND 27.8% IN 2004). THE RATE DECREASED IN 2006 COMPARED TO 2005

PRIMARILY DUE TO A HIGHER PERCENTAGE OF OUR PROFITS BEING

DERIVED FROM LOWER TAX JURISDICTIONS. IN ADDITION, THE RATE FOR

2005 INCLUDED AN INCREASE TO THE TAX PROVISION OF APPROXIMATELY

$265 MILLION AS A RESULT OF THE DECISION TO REPATRIATE

NON-U.S.

EARNINGS UNDER THE AMERICAN JOBS CREATION ACT OF 2004. PARTIALLY

OFFSETTING THE DECREASE IN THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE WAS THE IMPACT

OF SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION. THE PHASING OUT OF THE TAX BENEFIT

FOR EXPORT SALES ONLY SLIGHTLY INCREASED THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE

COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR, GIVEN THE DECREASE IN INCOME BEFORE

TAXES. OUR EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE WAS HIGHER IN 2005 COMPARED

TO 2004, DUE TO THE DECISION TO REPATRIATE

NON-U.S.

EARNINGS, WHICH WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE REVERSAL OF

PREVIOUSLY ACCRUED ITEMS. THE TAX RATE FOR 2004 INCLUDED A

$195 MILLION REDUCTION TO THE TAX PROVISION, PRIMARILY FROM

ADDITIONAL BENEFITS FOR EXPORT SALES ALONG WITH STATE TAX

BENEFITS FOR DIVESTITURES, AS WELL AS THE REVERSAL OF PREVIOUSLY

ACCRUED TAXES, PRIMARILY RELATED TO THE CLOSING OF A STATE

OPERATING

ACTIVITIES

CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES IS NET INCOME ADJUSTED FOR

CERTAIN NON-CASH ITEMS AND CHANGES IN ASSETS AND LIABILITIES.

FOR 2006 COMPARED TO 2005, THE LARGEST CONTRIBUTING FACTORS TO

THE DECREASE IN CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES WERE DUE

TO LOWER NET INCOME, LOWER NET MATURITIES OF TRADING ASSETS, AND

CHANGES IN THE AMOUNT OF ESTIMATED TAX PAYMENTS, PARTIALLY

OFFSET BY A DECREASE IN ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE BALANCES. FISCAL

YEAR 2006 INCLUDED SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION CHARGES OF

APPROXIMATELY $1.4 BILLION. FOR 2005 COMPARED TO 2004, THE

MAJORITY OF THE INCREASE IN CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING

ACTIVITIES WAS FROM HIGHER NET MATURITIES OF TRADING ASSETS AND

HIGHER NET INCOME, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN ACCOUNTS

RECEIVABLE BALANCES.

INVENTORIES AS OF DECEMBER 30, 2006 INCREASED COMPARED TO

DECEMBER 31, 2005, AS WE CONTINUED TO RAMP NEW, HIGHER COST

PRODUCTS, PRIMARILY RELATED TO MICROPROCESSORS ON OUR

65-NANOMETER PROCESS TECHNOLOGY AND ASSOCIATED CHIPSETS ON OUR

90-NANOMETER PROCESS TECHNOLOGY. ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AS OF

DECEMBER 30, 2006 DECREASED COMPARED TO DECEMBER 31,

2005, PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY LOWER REVENUE AND HIGHER CASH

COLLECTIONS. FOR 2006 AND 2005, OUR TWO LARGEST CUSTOMERS

ACCOUNTED FOR 35% OF NET REVENUE, WITH ONE OF THESE CUSTOMERS

ACCOUNTING FOR 19% OF REVENUE AND ANOTHER CUSTOMER ACCOUNTING

FOR 16%. ADDITIONALLY, THESE TWO LARGEST CUSTOMERS ACCOUNTED FOR

52% OF NET ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AT DECEMBER 30, 2006 (42% AT

DECEMBER 31, 2005).

INVESTING

ACTIVITIES

INVESTING CASH FLOWS CONSIST PRIMARILY OF CAPITAL EXPENDITURES

AND PAYMENTS FOR INVESTMENTS ACQUIRED, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY

PROCEEDS FROM INVESTMENT MATURITIES AND SALES. THE DECREASE IN

CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES IN 2006 COMPARED TO 2005 WAS

PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER NET MATURITIES AND SALES OF

AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE

INVESTMENTS. WE ALSO RECEIVED $752 MILLION FOR THE SALE OF THREE

COMPLETED DIVESTITURES (SEE NOTE 14: ACQUISITIONS AND

DIVESTITURES IN PART II, ITEM 8 OF THIS FORM

10-K).

ADDITIONALLY, DURING 2006 WE SOLD A PORTION OF OUR INVESTMENT IN

MICRON FOR $275 MILLION. PARTIALLY OFFSETTING THESE IMPACTS, WE

PAID $600 MILLION IN CASH FOR OUR EQUITY INVESTMENT IN CLEARWIRE

AND $615 MILLION IN CASH FOR OUR EQUITY INVESTMENT IN IMFT. IN

ADDITION TO THE $615 MILLION PAID IN CASH, OUR INITIAL

INVESTMENT IN IMFT OF $1.2 BILLION INCLUDED THE ISSUANCE OF $581

MILLION IN NOTES (REFLECTED AS A FINANCING ACTIVITY). IN

ADDITION, WE MADE A CAPITAL CONTRIBUTION OF $128 MILLION TO

IMFT. OTHER INVESTING ACTIVITIES FOR 2006 INCLUDED THE PURCHASE

OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY ASSETS FROM MICRON, CONCURRENT WITH THE

FORMATION OF IMFT, FOR $230 MILLION. FOR 2005 COMPARED TO 2004,

THE HIGHER CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES RESULTED FROM

CAPITAL SPENDING, PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY INVESTMENTS IN

65-NANOMETER PRODUCTION EQUIPMENT.

FINANCING

ACTIVITIES

FINANCING CASH FLOWS CONSIST PRIMARILY OF REPURCHASES AND

RETIREMENT OF COMMON STOCK AND PAYMENT OF DIVIDENDS TO

STOCKHOLDERS. THE LOWER CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES IN

2006 COMPARED TO 2005 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO A DECREASE IN

REPURCHASES AND RETIREMENT OF COMMON STOCK, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY

ADDITIONS TO LONG-TERM DEBT IN 2005 OF $1.7 BILLION. FOR

2006, WE REPURCHASED 226 MILLION SHARES OF COMMON STOCK FOR $4.6

BILLION COMPARED TO 418 MILLION SHARES FOR $10.6 BILLION IN

2005. AT DECEMBER 30, 2006, $17.3 BILLION REMAINED AVAILABLE FOR

REPURCHASE UNDER EXISTING REPURCHASE AUTHORIZATIONS. OUR

DIVIDEND PAYMENTS WERE $2.3 BILLION IN 2006, WHICH IS HIGHER

THAN THE $2.0 BILLION PAID IN 2005, DUE TO AN INCREASE FROM

$0.08 TO $0.10 IN CASH DIVIDENDS PER COMMON SHARE EFFECTIVE FOR

THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2006. ON JANUARY 18, 2007, OUR BOARD OF

DIRECTORS DECLARED A CASH DIVIDEND OF $0.1125 PER COMMON SHARE

EFFECTIVE THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2007. ADDITIONAL FINANCING

ACTIVITIES FOR 2006 INCLUDED PROCEEDS FROM THE SALE OF SHARES

PURSUANT TO EMPLOYEE EQUITY INCENTIVE PLANS OF $1.0 BILLION

($1.2 BILLION DURING 2005). FOR 2005 COMPARED TO 2004, THE

HIGHER CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO AN

INCREASE IN REPURCHASES AND RETIREMENTS OF COMMON STOCK,

PARTIALLY OFFSET BY CASH RECEIVED FROM THE ISSUANCE OF LONG-TERM

DEBT.

LIQUIDITY

DURING 2006, OUR LEVEL OF CASH DECLINED, AS OUR CASH PROVIDED BY

OPERATIONS WAS LESS THAN OUR CASH USED FOR INVESTING AND

FINANCING ACTIVITIES. CASH GENERATED BY OPERATIONS IS USED AS

OUR PRIMARY SOURCE OF LIQUIDITY. ANOTHER POTENTIAL SOURCE OF

LIQUIDITY IS AUTHORIZED BORROWINGS, INCLUDING COMMERCIAL PAPER,

OF $3.0 BILLION. THERE WERE NO BORROWINGS UNDER OUR COMMERCIAL

PAPER PROGRAM DURING 2006. WE ALSO HAVE AN AUTOMATIC SHELF

AN INDETERMINATE AMOUNT OF DEBT, EQUITY, AND OTHER SECURITIES.

WE BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE THE FINANCIAL RESOURCES NEEDED TO MEET

BUSINESS REQUIREMENTS FOR THE NEXT 12 MONTHS, INCLUDING CAPITAL

REQUIREMENTS, THE DIVIDEND PROGRAM, POTENTIAL STOCK REPURCHASES,

UNDER VARIOUS TYPES OF LICENSES AND NON-CONTINGENT FUNDING

OBLIGATIONS. FUNDING OBLIGATIONS INCLUDE, FOR EXAMPLE,

AGREEMENTS TO FUND VARIOUS PROJECTS WITH OTHER COMPANIES.

3

AMOUNTS REPRESENT TOTAL ANTICIPATED CASH PAYMENTS, INCLUDING

ANTICIPATED INTEREST PAYMENTS THAT ARE NOT RECORDED ON THE

CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS AND THE SHORT-TERM PORTION OF THE

OBLIGATION. ANY FUTURE SETTLEMENT OF CONVERTIBLE DEBT WOULD

REDUCE ANTICIPATED INTEREST

AND/OR

PRINCIPAL PAYMENTS. AMOUNTS EXCLUDE FAIR VALUE ADJUSTMENTS SUCH

AS DISCOUNTS OR PREMIUMS THAT AFFECT THE AMOUNT RECORDED ON THE

CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS.

4

TOTAL DOES NOT INCLUDE CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS ALREADY

RECORDED ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET AS CURRENT

LIABILITIES (EXCEPT FOR THE SHORT-TERM PORTION OF THE LONG-TERM

DEBT AND OTHER LONG-TERM LIABILITIES) OR CERTAIN PURCHASE

OBLIGATIONS, WHICH ARE DISCUSSED BELOW.

CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS FOR PURCHASES OF GOODS OR SERVICES

GENERALLY INCLUDE AGREEMENTS THAT ARE ENFORCEABLE AND LEGALLY

BINDING ON INTEL AND THAT SPECIFY ALL SIGNIFICANT TERMS,

INCLUDING FIXED OR MINIMUM QUANTITIES TO BE PURCHASED; FIXED,

MINIMUM, OR VARIABLE PRICE PROVISIONS; AND THE APPROXIMATE

TIMING OF THE TRANSACTION. THE TABLE ABOVE ALSO INCLUDES

AGREEMENTS TO PURCHASE RAW MATERIALS THAT HAVE CANCELLATION

PROVISIONS REQUIRING LITTLE OR NO PAYMENT. THE AMOUNTS UNDER

SUCH CONTRACTS ARE INCLUDED IN THE TABLE ABOVE BECAUSE

MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT CANCELLATION OF THESE CONTRACTS IS

UNLIKELY AND EXPECTS TO MAKE FUTURE CASH PAYMENTS ACCORDING TO

THE CONTRACT TERMS OR IN SIMILAR AMOUNTS FOR SIMILAR MATERIALS.

FOR OTHER OBLIGATIONS WITH CANCELLATION PROVISIONS, THE AMOUNTS

INCLUDED IN THE TABLE ABOVE WERE LIMITED TO THE NON-CANCELABLE

PORTION OF THE AGREEMENT TERMS, AND/OR THE MINIMUM CANCELLATION

FEE.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

MANAGEMENTS

DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)

WE HAVE ENTERED INTO CERTAIN AGREEMENTS FOR THE PURCHASE OF RAW

MATERIALS OR OTHER GOODS THAT SPECIFY MINIMUM PRICES, AND

QUANTITIES THAT ARE BASED ON A PERCENTAGE OF THE TOTAL AVAILABLE

MARKET OR BASED ON A PERCENTAGE OF OUR FUTURE PURCHASING

REQUIREMENTS. DUE TO THE UNCERTAINTY OF THE FUTURE MARKET AND

OUR FUTURE PURCHASING REQUIREMENTS, OBLIGATIONS UNDER THESE

AGREEMENTS ARE NOT INCLUDED IN THE TABLE ABOVE. WE ESTIMATE OUR

OBLIGATION UNDER THESE AGREEMENTS AS OF DECEMBER 30, 2006 TO BE

APPROXIMATELY AS FOLLOWS: LESS THAN ONE YEAR$175 MILLION;

ONE TO THREE YEARS$600 MILLION; THREE TO FIVE

YEARS$400 MILLION; MORE THAN FIVE YEARSZERO. OUR

PURCHASE ORDERS FOR OTHER PRODUCTS ARE BASED ON OUR CURRENT

MANUFACTURING NEEDS AND ARE FULFILLED BY OUR VENDORS WITHIN

SHORT TIME HORIZONS. IN ADDITION, SOME OF OUR PURCHASE ORDERS

REPRESENT AUTHORIZATIONS TO PURCHASE RATHER THAN BINDING

AGREEMENTS.

CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS THAT ARE CONTINGENT UPON THE ACHIEVEMENT

OF CERTAIN MILESTONES ARE NOT INCLUDED IN THE TABLE ABOVE. THESE

OBLIGATIONS INCLUDE MILESTONE-BASED CO-MARKETING AGREEMENTS,

CONTINGENT FUNDING OBLIGATIONS, AND MILESTONE-BASED EQUITY

INVESTMENT FUNDING. THESE ARRANGEMENTS ARE NOT CONSIDERED

CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS UNTIL THE MILESTONE IS MET BY THE THIRD

PARTY. AS OF DECEMBER 30, 2006, ASSUMING THAT ALL FUTURE

MILESTONES ARE MET, ADDITIONAL REQUIRED PAYMENTS WOULD BE

APPROXIMATELY $254 MILLION.

FOR THE MAJORITY OF RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS GRANTED, THE NUMBER

OF SHARES ISSUED ON THE DATE THE RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS VEST IS

NET OF THE STATUTORY WITHHOLDING REQUIREMENTS THAT ARE PAID BY

INTEL ON BEHALF OF ITS EMPLOYEES. THE OBLIGATION TO PAY THE

RELATIVE TAXING AUTHORITY IS NOT INCLUDED IN THE TABLE ABOVE, AS

THE AMOUNT IS CONTINGENT UPON CONTINUED EMPLOYMENT. IN ADDITION,

THE AMOUNT OF THE OBLIGATION IS UNKNOWN, AS IT IS BASED IN PART

ON THE MARKET PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK WHEN THE AWARDS VEST.

THE EXPECTED TIMING OF PAYMENTS OF THE OBLIGATIONS ABOVE ARE

ESTIMATES BASED ON CURRENT INFORMATION. TIMING OF PAYMENTS AND

ACTUAL AMOUNTS PAID MAY BE DIFFERENT, DEPENDING ON THE TIME OF

RECEIPT OF GOODS OR SERVICES, OR CHANGES TO

AGREED-UPON

AMOUNTS FOR SOME OBLIGATIONS. AMOUNTS DISCLOSED AS CONTINGENT OR

MILESTONE-BASED OBLIGATIONS ARE DEPENDENT ON THE ACHIEVEMENT OF

THE MILESTONES OR THE OCCURRENCE OF THE CONTINGENT EVENTS AND

CAN VARY SIGNIFICANTLY.

WE CURRENTLY HAVE A CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATION TO PURCHASE THE

OUTPUT OF IMFT IN PROPORTION TO OUR INVESTMENT IN IMFT, WHICH IS

CURRENTLY 49%. SEE NOTE 17: VENTURE IN PART II, ITEM

8 OF THIS FORM

10-K.

ADDITIONALLY, WE HAVE ENTERED INTO VARIOUS CONTRACTUAL

COMMITMENTS IN RELATION TO OUR INVESTMENT IN IMFT. SOME OF THESE

COMMITMENTS ARE WITH MICRON, AND SOME ARE DIRECTLY WITH IMFT.

THE FOLLOWING ARE THE SIGNIFICANT CONTRACTUAL COMMITMENTS.



SUBJECT TO CERTAIN CONDITIONS, INTEL AND MICRON EACH AGREED TO

CONTRIBUTE APPROXIMATELY AN ADDITIONAL $1.4 BILLION IN THE THREE

YEARS FOLLOWING THE INITIAL CAPITAL CONTRIBUTIONS, OF WHICH WE

HAVE CONTRIBUTED $128 MILLION AS OF DECEMBER 30, 2006. OF THE

REMAINING OBLIGATION OF $1.3 BILLION, WE CONTRIBUTED $258

MILLION IN JANUARY 2007. THIS AMOUNT HAS BEEN INCLUDED IN THE

TABLE ABOVE UNDER OTHER PURCHASE OBLIGATIONS AND

COMMITMENTS.



AS PART OF OUR AGREEMENT WITH MICRON RELATED TO IMFT, WE MAY

ENTER INTO AGREEMENTS TO MAKE ADDITIONAL CAPITAL CONTRIBUTIONS

FOR NEW FABRICATION FACILITIES, AND IN NOVEMBER 2006, WE

ANNOUNCED OUR INTENTION TO FORM A NEW VENTURE WITH MICRON TO ADD

AN ADDITIONAL NAND FLASH MEMORY FABRICATION FACILITY IN

SINGAPORE.



WE ALSO HAVE SEVERAL AGREEMENTS WITH MICRON RELATED TO

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS, AND RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

FUNDING RELATED TO NAND FLASH MANUFACTURING AND IMFT.

EMPLOYEE

EQUITY INCENTIVE PLANS

OUR EQUITY INCENTIVE PROGRAMS ARE BROAD-BASED, LONG-TERM

RETENTION PROGRAMS THAT ARE INTENDED TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN

TALENTED EMPLOYEES AND ALIGN STOCKHOLDER AND EMPLOYEE INTERESTS.

IN MAY 2006, STOCKHOLDERS APPROVED THE 2006 EQUITY INCENTIVE

PLAN (THE 2006 PLAN). THE 2006 PLAN REPLACED THE 2004 EQUITY

INCENTIVE PLAN, WHICH WAS TERMINATED EARLY. UNDER THE 2006 PLAN,

175 MILLION SHARES OF COMMON STOCK WERE MADE AVAILABLE FOR

ISSUANCE AS EQUITY AWARDS TO EMPLOYEES AND NON-EMPLOYEE

DIRECTORS THROUGH JUNE 2008, OF WHICH A MAXIMUM OF 80 MILLION

SHARES CAN BE AWARDED AS RESTRICTED STOCK OR RESTRICTED STOCK

UNITS. ADDITIONALLY, IN MAY 2006, STOCKHOLDERS APPROVED THE 2006

STOCK PURCHASE PLAN. UNDER THE 2006 STOCK PURCHASE PLAN, 240

MILLION SHARES OF COMMON STOCK WERE MADE AVAILABLE FOR ISSUANCE

THROUGH AUGUST 2011. THE 1976 STOCK PARTICIPATION PLAN AND ALL

REMAINING SHARES AVAILABLE FOR ISSUANCE THEREUNDER WERE

CANCELLED AS OF THE PLANS EXPIRATION IN AUGUST 2006.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

MANAGEMENTS

DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)

OUR GOAL HAS BEEN TO KEEP THE POTENTIAL INCREMENTAL DILUTION

RELATED TO OUR EQUITY INCENTIVE PLANS TO A LONG-TERM AVERAGE OF

LESS THAN 2% ANNUALLY. THE DILUTION PERCENTAGE IS CALCULATED

USING THE EQUITY-BASED AWARDS GRANTED DURING THE PERIOD, NET OF

AWARDS CANCELLED DUE TO EMPLOYEES LEAVING THE COMPANY AND

EXPIRED STOCK OPTIONS, DIVIDED BY THE TOTAL OUTSTANDING SHARES

AT THE BEGINNING OF THE YEAR. FOR PURPOSES OF THIS DISCLOSURE,

EQUITY-BASED AWARDS INCLUDE STOCK OPTION GRANTS AND RESTRICTED

STOCK UNIT GRANTS, BUT EXCLUDE RIGHTS GRANTED UNDER THE STOCK

PURCHASE PLAN AND AWARDS ASSUMED IN CONNECTION WITH ACQUISITIONS.

EQUITY-BASED AWARDS GRANTED TO EMPLOYEES, INCLUDING OFFICERS,

AND NON-EMPLOYEE DIRECTORS FROM 2002 THROUGH 2006 ARE SUMMARIZED

EMPLOYEES LEAVING THE COMPANY AND THE TIMING OF AWARD EXERCISES

BY EMPLOYEES. WE ARE IN THE MIDST OF A STRUCTURE AND EFFICIENCY

PROGRAM WHICH MAY RESULT IN SEVERAL ACTIONS THAT COULD HAVE AN

TABLE OF CONTENTS

MANAGEMENTS

DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)

OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS ARE SUBSTANTIALLY DEPENDENT ON SALES OF

MICROPROCESSORS. REVENUE IS PARTLY A FUNCTION OF THE MIX OF

TYPES AND PERFORMANCE CAPABILITIES OF MICROPROCESSORS SOLD, AS

WELL AS THE MIX OF CHIPSETS, FLASH MEMORY, AND OTHER

SEMICONDUCTOR PRODUCTS SOLD, ALL OF WHICH ARE DIFFICULT TO

FORECAST. BECAUSE OF THE WIDE PRICE DIFFERENCES AMONG MOBILE,

DESKTOP, AND SERVER MICROPROCESSORS, THE MIX OF TYPES AND

PERFORMANCE LEVELS OF MICROPROCESSORS SOLD AFFECTS THE AVERAGE

SELLING PRICE THAT WE WILL REALIZE AND HAS A LARGE IMPACT ON OUR

REVENUE AND GROSS MARGIN. REVENUE IS AFFECTED BY THE TIMING OF

NEW INTEL PRODUCT INTRODUCTIONS AND THE DEMAND FOR AND MARKET

ACCEPTANCE OF OUR PRODUCTS, AS WELL AS ACTIONS TAKEN BY OUR

COMPETITORS, INCLUDING NEW PRODUCT OFFERINGS, MARKETING

PROGRAMS, AND PRICING PRESSURES, AND OUR REACTION TO SUCH

ACTIONS. MICROPROCESSOR REVENUE IS ALSO DEPENDENT ON THE

AVAILABILITY OF OTHER PARTS OF THE PLATFORM, INCLUDING CHIPSETS,

MOTHERBOARDS, OPERATING SYSTEM SOFTWARE, AND APPLICATION

SOFTWARE. REVENUE IS ALSO SUBJECT TO DEMAND FLUCTUATIONS AND THE

IMPACT OF ECONOMIC CONDITIONS IN VARIOUS GEOGRAPHIC REGIONS.

OUR GROSS MARGIN EXPECTATION FOR 2007 IS 50% PLUS OR MINUS A FEW

POINTS. THE 50% MIDPOINT IS SLIGHTLY LOWER COMPARED TO OUR 2006

GROSS MARGIN OF 51.5%, PRIMARILY DUE TO EXPECTED HIGHER

START-UP

COSTS FOR MICROPROCESSORS AND CHIPSETS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY

LOWER UNIT COSTS ON MICROPROCESSORS. THE GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE

COULD VARY SIGNIFICANTLY FROM EXPECTATIONS BASED ON CHANGES IN

REVENUE LEVELS; PRODUCT MIX AND PRICING; CAPACITY UTILIZATION;

CHANGES IN UNIT COSTS; EXCESS OR OBSOLETE INVENTORY;

MANUFACTURING YIELDS; THE TIMING AND EXECUTION OF THE

MANUFACTURING RAMP AND ASSOCIATED COSTS, INCLUDING

START-UP

COSTS; AND IMPAIRMENTS OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS, INCLUDING

MANUFACTURING, ASSEMBLY AND TEST, AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS.

WE HAVE CONTINUED TO EXPAND OUR SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING AND

ASSEMBLY AND TEST CAPACITY OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS, AND WE

CONTINUE TO PLAN CAPACITY BASED ON OUR OVERALL STRATEGY AND THE

ACCEPTANCE OF OUR PRODUCTS IN SPECIFIC MARKET SEGMENTS. WE

CURRENTLY EXPECT THAT CAPITAL SPENDING IN 2007 WILL BE

APPROXIMATELY $5.5 BILLION, PLUS OR MINUS $200 MILLION, COMPARED

TO $5.8 BILLION IN 2006. CAPITAL SPENDING IS EXPECTED TO BE

LOWER IN 2007 COMPARED TO 2006, PRIMARILY DUE TO CONTINUED

EFFICIENCY EFFORTS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER SPENDING ON

CAPITAL EQUIPMENT, RELATED TO OUR NEXT-GENERATION, 45-NANOMETER

PROCESS TECHNOLOGY. THIS CAPITAL-SPENDING PLAN IS DEPENDENT ON

EXPECTATIONS REGARDING PRODUCTION EFFICIENCIES AND DELIVERY

TIMES OF VARIOUS MACHINERY AND EQUIPMENT, AND CONSTRUCTION

SCHEDULES. IF THE DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS DOES NOT GROW AND

CONTINUE TO MOVE TOWARD HIGHER PERFORMANCE PRODUCTS IN THE

VARIOUS MARKET SEGMENTS, REVENUE AND GROSS MARGIN WOULD BE

ADVERSELY AFFECTED, MANUFACTURING

AND/OR

ASSEMBLY AND TEST CAPACITY WOULD BE UNDER-UTILIZED, AND THE RATE

OF CAPITAL SPENDING COULD BE REDUCED. WE COULD BE REQUIRED TO

RECORD AN IMPAIRMENT OF OUR MANUFACTURING OR ASSEMBLY AND TEST

EQUIPMENT

AND/OR

FACILITIES, OR FACTORY PLANNING DECISIONS MAY CAUSE US TO RECORD

ACCELERATED DEPRECIATION. IN ADDITION, IF DEMAND FOR OUR

PRODUCTS IS REDUCED OR WE FAIL TO ACCURATELY FORECAST DEMAND, WE

COULD BE REQUIRED TO WRITE DOWN INVENTORY, WHICH WOULD HAVE A

NEGATIVE IMPACT ON OUR GROSS MARGIN. HOWEVER, IN THE LONG TERM,

REVENUE AND GROSS MARGIN MAY ALSO BE AFFECTED IF WE DO NOT ADD

CAPACITY FAST ENOUGH TO MEET MARKET DEMAND.

DEPRECIATION FOR 2007 IS EXPECTED TO BE APPROXIMATELY $4.8

BILLION, PLUS OR MINUS $100 MILLION, COMPARED TO $4.7 BILLION IN

2006.

SPENDING ON RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, PLUS MARKETING, GENERAL

AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES (TOTAL SPENDING) IN 2007 IS EXPECTED

TO BE APPROXIMATELY $10.7 BILLION. THE EXPECTATION FOR TOTAL

SPENDING IN 2007 IS SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER THAN OUR 2006 SPENDING

OF $12.0 BILLION. WE CONTINUE TO FOCUS ON CONTROLLING OUR TOTAL

SPENDING THROUGH COST-SAVING ACTIONS. EXPENSES, PARTICULARLY

CERTAIN MARKETING AND COMPENSATION EXPENSES, VARY DEPENDING ON

THE LEVEL OF DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS, THE LEVEL OF REVENUE AND

PROFITS, AND IMPAIRMENTS OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS. RESEARCH AND

DEVELOPMENT SPENDING IN 2007 IS EXPECTED TO BE APPROXIMATELY

$5.4 BILLION.

THE TAX RATE FOR 2007 IS EXPECTED TO BE APPROXIMATELY 30%. THE

ESTIMATED EFFECTIVE TAX RATE IS BASED ON TAX LAW IN EFFECT AT

DECEMBER 30, 2006 AND CURRENT EXPECTED INCOME. THE TAX RATE MAY

ALSO BE AFFECTED BY THE CLOSING OF ACQUISITIONS OR DIVESTITURES;

THE JURISDICTION IN WHICH PROFITS ARE DETERMINED TO BE EARNED

AND TAXED; CHANGES IN ESTIMATES OF CREDITS, BENEFITS, AND

DEDUCTIONS; THE RESOLUTION OF ISSUES ARISING FROM TAX AUDITS

WITH VARIOUS TAX AUTHORITIES; AND THE ABILITY TO REALIZE

DEFERRED TAX ASSETS.

WE BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE THE PRODUCT OFFERINGS, FACILITIES,

PERSONNEL, AND COMPETITIVE AND FINANCIAL RESOURCES FOR CONTINUED

BUSINESS SUCCESS, BUT FUTURE REVENUE, COSTS, GROSS MARGIN, AND

PROFITS ARE ALL INFLUENCED BY A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING

THOSE DISCUSSED ABOVE, ALL OF WHICH ARE INHERENTLY DIFFICULT TO

FORECAST.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET

RISK

WE ARE EXPOSED TO FINANCIAL MARKET RISKS, INCLUDING CHANGES IN

CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES, INTEREST RATES, AND MARKETABLE EQUITY

SECURITY PRICES. WE USE DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

PRIMARILY TO MITIGATE THESE RISKS AND AS PART OF OUR STRATEGIC

INVESTMENT PROGRAM. ALL OF THE POTENTIAL CHANGES NOTED BELOW ARE

BASED ON SENSITIVITY ANALYSES PERFORMED ON OUR FINANCIAL

POSITIONS AT DECEMBER 30, 2006 AND DECEMBER 31, 2005. ACTUAL

RESULTS MAY DIFFER MATERIALLY.

CURRENCY

EXCHANGE RATES

WE GENERALLY HEDGE CURRENCY RISKS OF

NON-U.S.-DOLLAR-DENOMINATED

INVESTMENTS IN DEBT SECURITIES WITH OFFSETTING CURRENCY

BORROWINGS, CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS, OR CURRENCY INTEREST

RATE SWAPS. GAINS AND LOSSES ON THESE

NON-U.S.-CURRENCY

INVESTMENTS WOULD GENERALLY BE OFFSET BY CORRESPONDING LOSSES

AND GAINS ON THE RELATED HEDGING INSTRUMENTS, RESULTING IN

NEGLIGIBLE NET EXPOSURE.

A SUBSTANTIAL MAJORITY OF OUR REVENUE, EXPENSE, AND CAPITAL

PURCHASING ACTIVITIES ARE TRANSACTED IN U.S. DOLLARS. HOWEVER,

WE DO INCUR CERTAIN OPERATING COSTS IN OTHER CURRENCIES. TO

PROTECT AGAINST REDUCTIONS IN VALUE AND THE VOLATILITY OF FUTURE

CASH FLOWS CAUSED BY CHANGES IN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES, WE HAVE

ESTABLISHED BALANCE SHEET AND FORECASTED TRANSACTION RISK

MANAGEMENT PROGRAMS. CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS AND CURRENCY

OPTIONS ARE GENERALLY UTILIZED IN THESE HEDGING PROGRAMS. OUR

HEDGING PROGRAMS REDUCE, BUT DO NOT ALWAYS ENTIRELY ELIMINATE,

THE IMPACT OF CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE MOVEMENTS. WE CONSIDERED

THE HISTORICAL TRENDS IN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES AND DETERMINED

THAT IT WAS REASONABLY POSSIBLE THAT ADVERSE CHANGES IN EXCHANGE

RATES OF 20% FOR ALL CURRENCIES COULD BE EXPERIENCED IN THE NEAR

TERM. SUCH ADVERSE CHANGES, AFTER TAKING INTO ACCOUNT HEDGES AND

OFFSETTING POSITIONS, WOULD HAVE RESULTED IN AN ADVERSE IMPACT

ON INCOME BEFORE TAXES OF LESS THAN $30 MILLION AT THE END OF

2006 AND 2005.

INTEREST

RATES

THE PRIMARY OBJECTIVE OF OUR INVESTMENTS IN DEBT SECURITIES IS

TO PRESERVE PRINCIPAL WHILE MAXIMIZING YIELDS. TO ACHIEVE THIS

OBJECTIVE, THE RETURNS ON OUR INVESTMENTS IN FIXED-RATE DEBT ARE

GENERALLY BASED ON THE THREE-MONTH LIBOR, OR, IF LONGER TERM,

ARE GENERALLY SWAPPED INTO U.S. DOLLAR THREE-MONTH LIBOR-BASED

RETURNS. IN ADDITION TO FIXED-RATE DEBT INVESTMENTS, IN 2005 WE

ISSUED DEBT. SEE NOTE 6: BORROWINGS IN PART II, ITEM

8 OF THIS FORM

10-K

FOR

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION. WE CONSIDERED THE HISTORICAL VOLATILITY

OF THE INTEREST RATES EXPERIENCED IN PRIOR YEARS AND THE

DURATION OF OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO AND DEBT ISSUANCES, AND

DETERMINED THAT IT WAS REASONABLY POSSIBLE THAT AN ADVERSE

CHANGE OF 80 BASIS POINTS (0.80%), APPROXIMATELY 15% OF THE RATE

AT DECEMBER 30, 2006 (18% OF THE RATE AT DECEMBER 31, 2005),

COULD BE EXPERIENCED IN THE NEAR TERM. A HYPOTHETICAL 0.80%

DECREASE IN INTEREST RATES, AFTER TAKING INTO ACCOUNT HEDGES AND

OFFSETTING POSITIONS, WOULD HAVE RESULTED IN A DECREASE IN THE

FAIR VALUE OF OUR NET INVESTMENT POSITION OF APPROXIMATELY $50

MILLION AS OF DECEMBER 30, 2006 AND $10 MILLION AS OF DECEMBER

31, 2005. THE INCREASE IN EXPOSURE TO AN ADVERSE FAIR VALUE

CHANGE FROM DECEMBER 31, 2005 TO DECEMBER 30, 2006 WAS PRIMARILY

DRIVEN BY A DECREASE IN THE PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK, WHICH

INCREASED THE SENSITIVITY OF THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR CONVERTIBLE

DEBT TO ADVERSE CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES.

EQUITY

SECURITY PRICES

WE HAVE A PORTFOLIO OF STRATEGIC EQUITY INVESTMENTS THAT

INCLUDES MARKETABLE STRATEGIC EQUITY SECURITIES AND DERIVATIVE

EQUITY INSTRUMENTS SUCH AS WARRANTS AND OPTIONS, AS WELL AS

NON-MARKETABLE EQUITY INVESTMENTS. WE INVEST IN COMPANIES THAT

DEVELOP SOFTWARE, HARDWARE, OR SERVICES SUPPORTING OUR

TECHNOLOGIES. OUR CURRENT INVESTMENT FOCUS AREAS INCLUDE HELPING

TO ENABLE MOBILE WIRELESS DEVICES, ADVANCE THE DIGITAL HOME,

PROVIDE ACCESS TO PREMIUM DIGITAL CONTENT, ENHANCE THE DIGITAL

ENTERPRISE, ADVANCE HIGH-PERFORMANCE COMMUNICATIONS

INFRASTRUCTURES, AND DEVELOP THE NEXT GENERATION OF SILICON

PRODUCTION TECHNOLOGIES. OUR FOCUS AREAS TEND TO DEVELOP AND

CHANGE OVER TIME DUE TO RAPID ADVANCEMENTS IN TECHNOLOGY.

OUR TOTAL MARKETABLE PORTFOLIO INCLUDES MARKETABLE STRATEGIC

EQUITY SECURITIES AS WELL AS MARKETABLE EQUITY SECURITIES

CLASSIFIED AS TRADING ASSETS. TO THE EXTENT THAT OUR MARKETABLE

PORTFOLIO OF INVESTMENTS CONTINUES TO HAVE STRATEGIC VALUE, WE

TYPICALLY DO NOT ATTEMPT TO REDUCE OR ELIMINATE OUR MARKET

EXPOSURE. FOR SECURITIES THAT WE NO LONGER CONSIDER STRATEGIC,

WE EVALUATE LEGAL, MARKET, AND ECONOMIC FACTORS IN OUR DECISION

ON THE TIMING OF DISPOSAL AND WHETHER IT IS POSSIBLE AND

APPROPRIATE TO HEDGE THE EQUITY MARKET RISK. WE MAY OR MAY NOT

ENTER INTO TRANSACTIONS TO REDUCE OR ELIMINATE THE MARKET RISKS

OF OUR INVESTMENTS IN STRATEGIC EQUITY DERIVATIVES, INCLUDING

WARRANTS.

THE MARKETABLE EQUITY SECURITIES INCLUDED IN TRADING ASSETS, AS

WELL AS CERTAIN EQUITY DERIVATIVES, ARE HELD TO GENERATE RETURNS

THAT GENERALLY OFFSET CHANGES IN LIABILITIES RELATED TO THE

EQUITY MARKET RISK OF CERTAIN DEFERRED COMPENSATION

ARRANGEMENTS. THE GAINS AND LOSSES FROM CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE OF

THESE EQUITY SECURITIES ARE GENERALLY OFFSET BY THE GAINS AND

LOSSES ON THE RELATED LIABILITIES, RESULTING IN A NET EXPOSURE

OF LESS THAN $10 MILLION AS OF BOTH DECEMBER 30, 2006 AND

DECEMBER 31, 2005, ASSUMING A REASONABLY POSSIBLE DECLINE IN

MARKET PRICES OF APPROXIMATELY 10% IN THE NEAR TERM.

46

TABLE OF CONTENTS

AS OF DECEMBER 30, 2006, THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR PORTFOLIO OF

MARKETABLE STRATEGIC EQUITY INVESTMENTS AND EQUITY DERIVATIVE

INSTRUMENTS, INCLUDING HEDGING POSITIONS, WAS $427 MILLION

($574 MILLION AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2005). TO ASSESS THE

MARKET PRICE SENSITIVITY OF THESE EQUITY SECURITIES, WE ANALYZED

THE HISTORICAL MOVEMENTS OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS OF

HIGH-TECHNOLOGY STOCK INDICES THAT WE CONSIDERED APPROPRIATE.

HOWEVER, OUR MARKETABLE STRATEGIC EQUITY PORTFOLIO IS

SUBSTANTIALLY CONCENTRATED IN ONE COMPANY AS OF

DECEMBER 30, 2006, WHICH WILL AFFECT THE PORTFOLIOS

PRICE VOLATILITY. WE CURRENTLY HAVE AN INVESTMENT IN MICRON WITH

A FAIR VALUE OF $236 MILLION AT DECEMBER 30, 2006, OR

55% OF THE TOTAL MARKETABLE STRATEGIC EQUITY PORTFOLIO VALUE

INCLUDING EQUITY DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS. DURING 2006, WE SOLD A

PORTION OF OUR INVESTMENT IN MICRON. BASED ON THE ANALYSIS OF

THE HIGH-TECHNOLOGY STOCK INDICES AND THE HISTORICAL VOLATILITY

OF MICRONS STOCK, WE ESTIMATED THAT IT WAS REASONABLY

POSSIBLE THAT THE PRICES OF THE STOCKS IN OUR MARKETABLE

STRATEGIC EQUITY PORTFOLIO COULD EXPERIENCE A LOSS OF 30% IN THE

NEAR TERM (40% AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2005). THIS ESTIMATE IS NOT

NECESSARILY INDICATIVE OF FUTURE PERFORMANCE, AND ACTUAL RESULTS

MAY DIFFER MATERIALLY.

ASSUMING A LOSS OF 30% IN MARKET PRICES, AND AFTER REFLECTING

THE IMPACT OF HEDGES AND OFFSETTING POSITIONS, OUR MARKETABLE

STRATEGIC EQUITY PORTFOLIO COULD DECREASE IN VALUE BY

APPROXIMATELY $134 MILLION, BASED ON THE VALUE OF THE PORTFOLIO

AS OF DECEMBER 30, 2006 (A DECREASE IN VALUE OF APPROXIMATELY

$245 MILLION, BASED ON THE VALUE OF THE PORTFOLIO AS OF DECEMBER

31, 2005 USING AN ASSUMED LOSS OF 40%).

OUR STRATEGIC INVESTMENTS IN NON-MARKETABLE EQUITY SECURITIES

ARE AFFECTED BY MANY OF THE SAME FACTORS THAT COULD RESULT IN AN

ADVERSE MOVEMENT OF EQUITY MARKET PRICES, ALTHOUGH THE IMPACT

CANNOT BE DIRECTLY QUANTIFIED. SUCH A MOVEMENT AND THE

UNDERLYING ECONOMIC CONDITIONS WOULD NEGATIVELY AFFECT THE

PROSPECTS OF THE COMPANIES WE INVEST IN, THEIR ABILITY TO RAISE

ADDITIONAL CAPITAL, AND THE LIKELIHOOD OF OUR BEING ABLE TO

REALIZE OUR INVESTMENTS THROUGH LIQUIDITY EVENTS SUCH AS INITIAL

PUBLIC OFFERINGS, MERGERS, OR PRIVATE SALES. THESE TYPES OF

INVESTMENTS INVOLVE A GREAT DEAL OF RISK, AND THERE CAN BE NO

ASSURANCE THAT ANY SPECIFIC COMPANY WILL GROW OR BECOME

SUCCESSFUL; CONSEQUENTLY, WE COULD LOSE ALL OR PART OF OUR

INVESTMENT. AT DECEMBER 30, 2006, OUR STRATEGIC INVESTMENTS IN

NON-MARKETABLE EQUITY SECURITIES HAD A CARRYING AMOUNT OF $2.8

BILLION ($561 MILLION AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2005). THE CARRYING

AMOUNT OF THESE INVESTMENTS APPROXIMATED FAIR VALUE AS OF

DECEMBER 30, 2006 AND DECEMBER 31, 2005. AS OF DECEMBER 30,

2006, OUR NON-MARKETABLE EQUITY SECURITIES PORTFOLIO WAS

CONCENTRATED IN TWO COMPANIES: IMFT AND CLEARWIRE. IMFT IS A

MANUFACTURER OF NAND FLASH MEMORY, WITH A CARRYING AMOUNT OF

$1.3 BILLION, OR 46% OF THE TOTAL VALUE OF THE NON-MARKETABLE

EQUITY SECURITIES PORTFOLIO AT DECEMBER 30, 2006. SEE NOTE

17: VENTURE IN PART II, ITEM 8 OF THIS FORM

10-K.

THE

TERMS OF OUR INVESTMENT IN IMFT CONTAIN CONTRACTUAL CONDITIONS

THAT RESTRICT OUR ABILITY TO SELL THE INVESTMENT. CLEARWIRE

BUILDS AND OPERATES NEXT-GENERATION WIRELESS BROADBAND NETWORKS.

OUR INVESTMENT HAS A CARRYING AMOUNT OF $613 MILLION, OR 22% OF

THE TOTAL VALUE OF THE NON-MARKETABLE EQUITY SECURITIES

PORTFOLIO AT DECEMBER 30, 2006. SEE NOTE 7.

INVESTMENTS IN PART II, ITEM 8 OF THIS FORM

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS

NOTE 1.

BASIS OF PRESENTATION

INTEL CORPORATION HAS A 52- OR

53-WEEK

FISCAL YEAR THAT ENDS ON THE LAST SATURDAY IN DECEMBER. FISCAL

YEAR 2006, A

52-WEEK

YEAR, ENDED ON DECEMBER 30, 2006. FISCAL YEAR 2005, A

53-WEEK

YEAR, ENDED ON DECEMBER 31, 2005. FISCAL YEAR 2004 WAS A

52-WEEK

YEAR

THAT ENDED ON DECEMBER 25, 2004. THE NEXT

53-WEEK

YEAR

WILL END ON DECEMBER 31, 2011.

THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDE THE ACCOUNTS OF

INTEL AND ITS WHOLLY OWNED SUBSIDIARIES. INTERCOMPANY ACCOUNTS

AND TRANSACTIONS HAVE BEEN ELIMINATED. THE COMPANY USES THE

EQUITY METHOD TO ACCOUNT FOR EQUITY INVESTMENTS IN INSTANCES IN

WHICH THE COMPANY OWNS COMMON STOCK OR SIMILAR INTERESTS (AS

DESCRIBED BY THE EMERGING ISSUES TASK FORCE (EITF) ISSUE

NO. 02-14, WHETHER AN INVESTOR SHOULD APPLY THE

EQUITY METHOD OF ACCOUNTING TO INVESTMENTS OTHER THAN COMMON

STOCK) AND HAS THE ABILITY TO EXERCISE SIGNIFICANT

INFLUENCE, BUT NOT CONTROL, OVER THE INVESTEE.

THE U.S. DOLLAR IS THE FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY FOR INTEL AND ITS

SIGNIFICANT SUBSIDIARIES; THEREFORE, THERE IS NO TRANSLATION

ADJUSTMENT RECORDED THROUGH ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE

INCOME (LOSS). MONETARY ACCOUNTS DENOMINATED IN

NON-U.S.

CURRENCIES, SUCH AS CASH OR PAYABLES TO VENDORS, HAVE BEEN

REMEASURED TO THE U.S. DOLLAR.

NOTE 2.

ACCOUNTING POLICIES

USE OF

ESTIMATES

THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN CONFORMITY WITH U.S.

GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO

MAKE ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS THAT AFFECT THE AMOUNTS REPORTED IN

THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND ACCOMPANYING NOTES. THE ACCOUNTING

ESTIMATES THAT REQUIRE MANAGEMENTS MOST SIGNIFICANT,

DIFFICULT, AND SUBJECTIVE JUDGMENTS INCLUDE THE VALUATION OF

NON-MARKETABLE EQUITY SECURITIES; THE RECOGNITION AND

MEASUREMENT OF CURRENT AND DEFERRED INCOME TAX ASSETS AND

LIABILITIES; THE ASSESSMENT OF RECOVERABILITY OF LONG-LIVED

ASSETS; THE VALUATION OF INVENTORY; AND THE VALUATION AND

RECOGNITION OF SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION. THE ACTUAL RESULTS

EXPERIENCED BY THE COMPANY MAY DIFFER FROM MANAGEMENTS

ESTIMATES. CERTAIN AMOUNTS REPORTED IN PREVIOUS PERIODS HAVE

BEEN RECLASSIFIED TO CONFORM TO THE CURRENT PRESENTATION.

CASH

AND CASH EQUIVALENTS

THE COMPANY CONSIDERS ALL HIGHLY LIQUID DEBT SECURITIES WITH

INSIGNIFICANT INTEREST RATE RISK AND WITH ORIGINAL MATURITIES

FROM THE DATE OF PURCHASE OF APPROXIMATELY THREE MONTHS OR LESS

AS CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS.

TRADING

ASSETS

INVESTMENTS DESIGNATED AS TRADING ASSETS ARE REPORTED AT FAIR

VALUE, WITH GAINS OR LOSSES RESULTING FROM CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE

RECOGNIZED CURRENTLY IN EARNINGS. THE COMPANYS TRADING

ASSET INVESTMENTS INCLUDE.



MARKETABLE DEBT SECURITIES

WHEN THE INTEREST RATE OR

FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATE RISK IS HEDGED AT INCEPTION BY A RELATED

DERIVATIVE. THE GAINS OR LOSSES OF THESE INVESTMENTS ARISING

FROM CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE DUE TO INTEREST RATE AND CURRENCY

MARKET FLUCTUATIONS, OFFSET BY LOSSES OR GAINS ON THE RELATED

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS, ARE INCLUDED IN INTEREST AND OTHER, NET.



EQUITY SECURITIES OFFSETTING DEFERRED COMPENSATION

WHEN

THE INVESTMENTS SEEK TO OFFSET CHANGES IN LIABILITIES RELATED TO

EQUITY AND OTHER MARKET RISKS OF CERTAIN DEFERRED COMPENSATION

ARRANGEMENTS. THE GAINS OR LOSSES FROM CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE OF

THESE EQUITY SECURITIES ARE OFFSET BY LOSSES OR GAINS ON THE

RELATED LIABILITIES AND ARE INCLUDED IN INTEREST AND OTHER, NET.



MARKETABLE EQUITY SECURITIES

WHEN THE COMPANY DEEMS THE

INVESTMENTS NOT TO BE STRATEGIC IN NATURE AT THE TIME OF

ORIGINAL CLASSIFICATION, AND HAS THE ABILITY AND INTENT TO

MITIGATE EQUITY MARKET RISK THROUGH THE SALE OR THE USE OF

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS. FOR THESE MARKETABLE EQUITY SECURITIES,

GAINS OR LOSSES FROM CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE, PRIMARILY OFFSET BY

LOSSES OR GAINS ON RELATED DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS, ARE INCLUDED

IN GAINS (LOSSES) ON EQUITY SECURITIES, NET.

INSTRUMENT INVESTMENTS

DEBT INSTRUMENTS WITH ORIGINAL MATURITIES AT THE DATE OF

AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE

INVESTMENTS

INVESTMENTS DESIGNATED AS

AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE

ARE REPORTED AT FAIR VALUE, WITH UNREALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES,

NET OF TAX, RECORDED IN ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME

IDENTIFICATION METHOD. THE COMPANYS

AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE

INVESTMENTS INCLUDE.



MARKETABLE DEBT SECURITIES

WHEN THE INTEREST RATE AND

FOREIGN CURRENCY RISKS ARE NOT HEDGED AT INCEPTION OF THE

INVESTMENT. THESE DEBT SECURITIES ARE HELD TO GENERATE A RETURN

COMMENSURATE WITH THREE-MONTH LIBOR. THE INTEREST INCOME AND

REALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES ON THE SALE OF THESE SECURITIES ARE

RECORDED IN INTEREST AND OTHER, NET.



MARKETABLE EQUITY SECURITIES

WHEN THE INVESTMENTS ARE

CONSIDERED STRATEGIC IN NATURE AT THE TIME OF ORIGINAL

CLASSIFICATION. THE COMPANY ACQUIRES THESE EQUITY INVESTMENTS

FOR THE PROMOTION OF BUSINESS AND STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES. TO THE

EXTENT THAT THESE INVESTMENTS CONTINUE TO HAVE STRATEGIC VALUE,

THE COMPANY TYPICALLY DOES NOT ATTEMPT TO REDUCE OR ELIMINATE

THE INHERENT EQUITY MARKET RISKS THROUGH HEDGING ACTIVITIES. THE

REALIZED GAINS OR LOSSES ON THE SALE OR EXCHANGE OF MARKETABLE

EQUITY SECURITIES ARE RECORDED IN GAINS (LOSSES) ON EQUITY

SECURITIES, NET.

NON-MARKETABLE

INVESTMENTS

NON-MARKETABLE EQUITY SECURITIES ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AT HISTORICAL

COST OR, IF INTEL HAS THE ABILITY TO EXERCISE SIGNIFICANT

INFLUENCE, BUT NOT CONTROL, OVER THE INVESTEE, USING THE EQUITY

METHOD OF ACCOUNTING. INTELS PROPORTIONATE SHARE OF

INVESTEE INCOME OR LOSS ARE ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER THE EQUITY

METHOD. OTHER EQUITY METHOD ADJUSTMENTS, AS WELL AS GAINS OR

LOSSES ON THE SALE OR EXCHANGE OF THESE INVESTMENTS, ARE

RECORDED IN INTEREST AND OTHER, NET. GAINS OR LOSSES ON THE SALE

OR EXCHANGE OF NON-MARKETABLE EQUITY SECURITIES, WHICH ARE NOT

SUBJECT TO THE EQUITY METHOD OF ACCOUNTING, ARE RECORDED IN

GAINS (LOSSES) ON EQUITY SECURITIES, NET. NON-MARKETABLE EQUITY

SECURITIES ARE INCLUDED IN OTHER LONG-TERM ASSETS. CERTAIN OTHER

NON-MARKETABLE INVESTMENTS, SUCH AS COST BASIS LOAN

PARTICIPATION NOTES, ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AT AMORTIZED COST AND ARE

CLASSIFIED AS SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS AND OTHER LONG-TERM

INVESTMENTS.

OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY

IMPAIRMENT

ALL OF THE COMPANYS

AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE

INVESTMENTS, NON-MARKETABLE EQUITY SECURITIES, AND OTHER

INVESTMENTS ARE SUBJECT TO A PERIODIC IMPAIRMENT REVIEW.

INVESTMENTS ARE CONSIDERED TO BE IMPAIRED WHEN A DECLINE IN FAIR

VALUE IS JUDGED TO BE

OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY,

FOR THE FOLLOWING INVESTMENTS.



MARKETABLE EQUITY SECURITIES

WHEN THE RESULTING FAIR

VALUE IS SIGNIFICANTLY BELOW COST BASIS

AND/OR

HAS

LASTED FOR AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF TIME. THE EVALUATION THAT INTEL

USES TO DETERMINE WHETHER A MARKETABLE EQUITY SECURITY IS

IMPAIRED IS BASED ON THE SPECIFIC FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES

PRESENT AT THE TIME OF ASSESSMENT, WHICH INCLUDE THE

CONSIDERATION OF GENERAL MARKET CONDITIONS, THE DURATION AND

EXTENT TO WHICH THE FAIR VALUE IS LESS THAN COST, AND THE

COMPANYS INTENT AND ABILITY TO HOLD THE INVESTMENT FOR A

SUFFICIENT PERIOD OF TIME TO ALLOW FOR RECOVERY IN VALUE. THE

COMPANY ALSO CONSIDERS SPECIFIC ADVERSE CONDITIONS RELATED TO

THE FINANCIAL HEALTH OF AND BUSINESS OUTLOOK FOR THE INVESTEE,

INCLUDING INDUSTRY AND SECTOR PERFORMANCE, CHANGES IN

TECHNOLOGY, OPERATIONAL AND FINANCING CASH FLOW FACTORS, AND

CHANGES IN THE INVESTEES CREDIT RATING.



NON-MARKETABLE INVESTMENTS

WHEN EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES

ARE IDENTIFIED THAT WOULD LIKELY HAVE A SIGNIFICANT ADVERSE

EFFECT ON THE FAIR VALUE OF THE INVESTMENT. THE INDICATORS THAT

INTEL USES TO IDENTIFY THOSE EVENTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES INCLUDE

(A) THE INVESTEES REVENUE AND EARNING TRENDS RELATIVE TO

PREDEFINED MILESTONES AND OVERALL BUSINESS PROSPECTS; (B) THE

TECHNOLOGICAL FEASIBILITY OF THE INVESTEES PRODUCTS AND

TECHNOLOGIES; (C) THE GENERAL MARKET CONDITIONS IN THE

INVESTEES INDUSTRY OR GEOGRAPHIC AREA, INCLUDING ADVERSE

REGULATORY OR ECONOMIC CHANGES; (D) FACTORS RELATED TO THE

INVESTEES ABILITY TO REMAIN IN BUSINESS, SUCH AS THE

INVESTEES LIQUIDITY, DEBT RATIOS, AND THE RATE AT WHICH

THE INVESTEE IS USING ITS CASH; AND (E) THE INVESTEES

RECEIPT OF ADDITIONAL FUNDING AT A LOWER VALUATION. IF AN

INVESTEE OBTAINS ADDITIONAL FUNDING AT A VALUATION LOWER THAN

INTELS CARRYING AMOUNT OR A NEW ROUND OF EQUITY FUNDING IS

REQUIRED TO STAY IN OPERATION, AND THE NEW ROUND OF EQUITY DOES

NOT APPEAR IMMINENT, IT IS PRESUMED THAT THE INVESTMENT IS OTHER

THAN TEMPORARILY IMPAIRED, UNLESS SPECIFIC FACTS AND

CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE OTHERWISE.



MARKETABLE DEBT SECURITIES

WHEN A SIGNIFICANT DECLINE IN

THE ISSUERS CREDIT QUALITY IS LIKELY TO HAVE A SIGNIFICANT

ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE FAIR VALUE OF THE INVESTMENT.

INVESTMENTS IDENTIFIED AS HAVING AN INDICATOR OF IMPAIRMENT ARE

SUBJECT TO FURTHER ANALYSIS TO DETERMINE IF THE INVESTMENT IS

OTHER THAN TEMPORARILY IMPAIRED, IN WHICH CASE THE INVESTMENT IS

WRITTEN DOWN TO ITS IMPAIRED VALUE AND A NEW COST BASIS IS

ESTABLISHED. FOR INVESTMENTS IN NON-MARKETABLE EQUITY SECURITIES

THAT ARE NOT CONSIDERED VIABLE FROM A FINANCIAL OR TECHNOLOGICAL

POINT OF VIEW, THE ENTIRE INVESTMENT IS WRITTEN DOWN, SINCE THE

ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE IS CONSIDERED TO BE NOMINAL. IMPAIRMENT

CHARGES ARE RECORDED IN GAINS (LOSSES) ON EQUITY SECURITIES, NET

FOR EQUITY INVESTMENTS OR IN INTEREST AND OTHER, NET FOR DEBT

SECURITY INVESTMENTS.

FAIR

VALUES OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

THE CARRYING VALUE OF CASH EQUIVALENTS APPROXIMATES FAIR VALUE

DUE TO THE SHORT PERIOD OF TIME TO MATURITY. FAIR VALUES OF

SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS, TRADING ASSETS, LONG-TERM INVESTMENTS,

MARKETABLE STRATEGIC EQUITY SECURITIES, CERTAIN NON-MARKETABLE

INVESTMENTS, SHORT-TERM DEBT, LONG-TERM DEBT, SWAPS, CURRENCY

FORWARD CONTRACTS, CURRENCY OPTIONS, EQUITY OPTIONS, AND

WARRANTS ARE BASED ON QUOTED MARKET PRICES OR PRICING MODELS

USING CURRENT MARKET DATA WHEN AVAILABLE. DEBT SECURITIES ARE

GENERALLY VALUED USING DISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS IN A YIELD-CURVE

MODEL BASED ON LIBOR. EQUITY OPTIONS AND WARRANTS ARE PRICED

USING OPTION PRICING MODELS. THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL

INSTRUMENTS ARE RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE OR AMOUNTS THAT

APPROXIMATE FAIR VALUE EXCEPT FOR COST BASIS LOAN PARTICIPATION

NOTES AND DEBT. ESTIMATED FAIR VALUES ARE MANAGEMENTS

ESTIMATES; HOWEVER, WHEN THERE IS NO READILY AVAILABLE MARKET

DATA, THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUES MAY NOT NECESSARILY REPRESENT

THE AMOUNTS THAT COULD BE REALIZED IN A CURRENT TRANSACTION, AND

THESE FAIR VALUES COULD CHANGE SIGNIFICANTLY.

FOR CERTAIN NON-MARKETABLE INVESTMENTS, SUCH AS NON-MARKETABLE

EQUITY SECURITIES, MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT THE CARRYING VALUE

OF THE PORTFOLIO APPROXIMATED THE FAIR VALUE AT DECEMBER 30,

2006 AND DECEMBER 31, 2005. FOR THE COMPANYS COST BASIS

LOAN PARTICIPATION NOTES, THE FAIR VALUE EXCEEDS THE CARRYING

VALUE BY APPROXIMATELY $55 MILLION AS OF DECEMBER 30,

2006. MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE COST

BASIS LOAN PARTICIPATION NOTES APPROXIMATED FAIR VALUE AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2005. THESE FAIR VALUE ESTIMATES TAKE INTO

ACCOUNT THE MOVEMENTS OF THE EQUITY AND VENTURE CAPITAL MARKETS

AS WELL AS CHANGES IN THE INTEREST RATE ENVIRONMENT, AND OTHER

ECONOMIC VARIABLES.

THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE COMPANYS LONG-TERM DEBT WAS $1.8

BILLION, AND MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT THE FAIR VALUE WAS

APPROXIMATELY $1.7 BILLION AS OF DECEMBER 30, 2006.

MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE

COMPANYS LONG-TERM DEBT APPROXIMATED FAIR VALUE AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2005. THESE FAIR VALUE ESTIMATES TAKE INTO

CONSIDERATION CREDIT RATING CHANGES, EQUITY PRICE MOVEMENTS,

INTEREST RATE CHANGES, AND OTHER ECONOMIC VARIABLES.

DERIVATIVE

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

THE COMPANYS PRIMARY OBJECTIVE FOR HOLDING DERIVATIVE

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS IS TO MANAGE CURRENCY, INTEREST RATE, AND

CERTAIN EQUITY MARKET RISKS. THE COMPANYS DERIVATIVE

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS ARE RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE AND ARE

INCLUDED IN OTHER CURRENT ASSETS, OTHER LONG-TERM ASSETS, OTHER

ACCRUED LIABILITIES, OR OTHER LONG-TERM LIABILITIES. DERIVATIVE

INSTRUMENTS RECORDED AS ASSETS TOTALED $117 MILLION AT

DECEMBER 30, 2006 ($87 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2005).

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS RECORDED AS LIABILITIES TOTALED

$62 MILLION AT DECEMBER 30, 2006 ($65 MILLION AT

DECEMBER 31, 2005). THE COMPANYS ACCOUNTING POLICIES

FOR THESE INSTRUMENTS ARE BASED ON WHETHER THEY MEET THE

CRITERIA FOR DESIGNATION AS CASH FLOW OR FAIR VALUE HEDGES. A

HEDGE OF THE EXPOSURE TO VARIABILITY IN THE FUTURE CASH FLOWS OF

AN ASSET OR A LIABILITY, OR OF A FORECASTED TRANSACTION, IS

REFERRED TO AS A CASH FLOW HEDGE. A DESIGNATED HEDGE OF THE

EXPOSURE TO CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE OF AN ASSET OR A LIABILITY, OR

OF AN UNRECOGNIZED FIRM COMMITMENT, IS REFERRED TO AS A FAIR

VALUE HEDGE. THE CRITERIA FOR DESIGNATING A DERIVATIVE AS A

HEDGE INCLUDE THE ASSESSMENT OF THE INSTRUMENTS

EFFECTIVENESS IN RISK REDUCTION, MATCHING OF THE DERIVATIVE

INSTRUMENT TO ITS UNDERLYING TRANSACTION, AND THE PROBABILITY OF

OCCURRENCE OF THE UNDERLYING TRANSACTION. GAINS AND LOSSES FROM

CHANGES IN FAIR VALUES OF DERIVATIVES THAT ARE NOT DESIGNATED AS

HEDGES FOR ACCOUNTING PURPOSES ARE RECOGNIZED WITHIN THE SAME

LINE ITEM ON THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME AS THE

UNDERLYING ITEM, AND GENERALLY OFFSET CHANGES IN FAIR VALUES OF

RELATED ASSETS OR LIABILITIES.

AS PART OF ITS STRATEGIC INVESTMENT PROGRAM, THE COMPANY ALSO

ACQUIRES EQUITY DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS, SUCH AS WARRANTS AND

EQUITY CONVERSION RIGHTS ASSOCIATED WITH DEBT INSTRUMENTS, WHICH

ARE NOT DESIGNATED AS HEDGING INSTRUMENTS. THE GAINS OR LOSSES

FROM CHANGES IN FAIR VALUES OF THESE EQUITY INSTRUMENT

DERIVATIVES ARE RECOGNIZED IN GAINS (LOSSES) ON EQUITY

SECURITIES, NET.

THROUGH THE USE OF DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, THE COMPANY

MANAGES THE FOLLOWING RISKS.

CURRENCY

RISK

THE COMPANY TRANSACTS BUSINESS IN VARIOUS CURRENCIES OTHER THAN

THE U.S. DOLLAR AND HAS ESTABLISHED BALANCE SHEET AND

FORECASTED TRANSACTION RISK MANAGEMENT PROGRAMS TO PROTECT

AGAINST FLUCTUATIONS IN FAIR VALUE AND VOLATILITY OF FUTURE CASH

FLOWS CAUSED BY CHANGES IN EXCHANGE RATES. THE FORECASTED

TRANSACTION RISK MANAGEMENT PROGRAM INCLUDES ANTICIPATED

TRANSACTIONS SUCH AS OPERATING COSTS AND CAPITAL PURCHASES.

THESE PROGRAMS REDUCE, BUT DO NOT ALWAYS ENTIRELY ELIMINATE, THE

IMPACT OF CURRENCY EXCHANGE MOVEMENTS. THE COMPANYS

CURRENCY RISK MANAGEMENT PROGRAMS INCLUDE.

CURRENCY DERIVATIVES WITH CASH FLOW HEDGE ACCOUNTING

DESIGNATION

WHICH UTILIZE CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS AND

CURRENCY OPTIONS TO HEDGE EXPOSURES TO THE VARIABILITY IN THE

U.S.-DOLLAR

EQUIVALENT OF ANTICIPATED

NON-U.S.-DOLLAR-DENOMINATED

CASH FLOWS. THE MATURITY OF THESE INSTRUMENTS WILL GENERALLY

OCCUR WITHIN 12 MONTHS. FOR THESE DERIVATIVES, THE AFTER-TAX

GAIN OR LOSS FROM THE EFFECTIVE PORTION OF THE HEDGE IS REPORTED

AS A COMPONENT OF ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS)

IN STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY AND IS RECLASSIFIED INTO EARNINGS

IN THE SAME PERIOD OR PERIODS IN WHICH THE HEDGED TRANSACTION

AFFECTS EARNINGS, AND WITHIN THE SAME LINE ITEM ON THE

CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME AS THE IMPACT OF THE HEDGED

TRANSACTION.



CURRENCY DERIVATIVES WITH FAIR VALUE HEDGE ACCOUNTING

DESIGNATION

WHICH UTILIZE CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS AND

CURRENCY OPTIONS TO HEDGE THE FAIR VALUE EXPOSURE OF RECOGNIZED

FOREIGN CURRENCY DENOMINATED ASSETS OR LIABILITIES, OR

PREVIOUSLY UNRECOGNIZED FIRM COMMITMENTS. FOR FAIR VALUE HEDGES,

GAINS OR LOSSES ARE RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS TO OFFSET FAIR VALUE

CHANGES IN THE HEDGED TRANSACTION. AS OF DECEMBER 30, 2006 AND

DECEMBER 31, 2005, THE COMPANY DID NOT HAVE ANY DERIVATIVES

DESIGNATED AS FOREIGN CURRENCY FAIR VALUE HEDGES.



CURRENCY DERIVATIVES WITHOUT HEDGE ACCOUNTING DESIGNATION

WHICH UTILIZE CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS OR CURRENCY

CURRENCY EQUIVALENT CASH FLOWS OF RECOGNIZED MONETARY ASSETS,

INCLUDING

NON-U.S.-DOLLAR-DENOMINATED

DEBT SECURITIES AND RECOGNIZED MONETARY ASSETS AND LIABILITIES.

THE MATURITY OF THESE INSTRUMENTS WILL GENERALLY OCCUR WITHIN 12

MONTHS, EXCEPT FOR DERIVATIVES ASSOCIATED WITH CERTAIN LONG-TERM

EQUITY-RELATED INVESTMENTS THAT WILL GENERALLY MATURE WITHIN

FIVE YEARS. CHANGES IN THE

U.S.-DOLLAR

EQUIVALENT CASH FLOWS OF THE UNDERLYING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES

ARE APPROXIMATELY OFFSET BY THE CHANGES IN FAIR VALUES OF THE

RELATED DERIVATIVES. NET GAINS OR LOSSES ARE RECORDED WITHIN THE

LINE ITEM ON THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME THAT IS MOST

CLOSELY ASSOCIATED WITH THE ECONOMIC UNDERLYING, PRIMARILY IN

INTEREST AND OTHER, NET, EXCEPT FOR EQUITY-RELATED GAINS OR

LOSSES, WHICH ARE PRIMARILY RECORDED IN GAINS (LOSSES) ON EQUITY

SECURITIES, NET.

INTEREST

RATE RISK

THE COMPANYS PRIMARY OBJECTIVE FOR HOLDING INVESTMENTS IN

DEBT SECURITIES IS TO PRESERVE PRINCIPAL WHILE MAXIMIZING

YIELDS. THE RETURNS ON THE COMPANYS INVESTMENTS IN

FIXED-RATE DEBT SECURITIES WITH DURATIONS LONGER THAN THREE

MONTHS ARE GENERALLY SWAPPED INTO U.S. DOLLAR THREE-MONTH

LIBOR-BASED RETURNS. THE COMPANYS INTEREST RATE RISK

MANAGEMENT PROGRAMS INCLUDE.



INTEREST RATE DERIVATIVES WITH CASH FLOW HEDGE ACCOUNTING

DESIGNATION

WHICH UTILIZE INTEREST RATE SWAP AGREEMENTS TO

AS A COMPONENT OF ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS)

AND IS RECLASSIFIED INTO EARNINGS IN THE SAME PERIOD OR PERIODS

IN WHICH THE HEDGED TRANSACTION AFFECTS EARNINGS, AND WITHIN THE

SAME LINE ITEM ON THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME AS THE

EQUITY DERIVATIVES DESIGNATED AS FAIR VALUE HEDGES.



EQUITY DERIVATIVES WITHOUT HEDGE ACCOUNTING DESIGNATION

WHICH UTILIZE EQUITY DERIVATIVES, SUCH AS WARRANTS, OPTIONS,

OR OTHER EQUITY DERIVATIVES. CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF SUCH

DERIVATIVES ARE RECOGNIZED IN GAINS (LOSSES) ON EQUITY

SECURITIES, NET. CERTAIN EQUITY SECURITIES WITHIN THE TRADING

ASSET PORTFOLIO ARE MAINTAINED TO GENERATE RETURNS THAT SEEK TO

OFFSET CHANGES IN LIABILITIES RELATED TO THE EQUITY MARKET RISK

OF CERTAIN DEFERRED COMPENSATION ARRANGEMENTS, AND GAINS AND

LOSSES ARE RECORDED IN INTEREST AND OTHER, NET.

MEASUREMENT

OF EFFECTIVENESS



EFFECTIVENESS FOR FORWARDS

IS GENERALLY MEASURED BY

COMPARING THE CUMULATIVE CHANGE IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE HEDGE

CONTRACT WITH THE CUMULATIVE CHANGE IN THE PRESENT VALUE OF THE

FORECASTED CASH FLOWS OF THE HEDGED ITEM. FOR CURRENCY FORWARD

CONTRACTS USED IN CASH FLOW HEDGING STRATEGIES RELATED TO

LONG-TERM CAPITAL PURCHASES, FORWARD POINTS ARE EXCLUDED AND

EFFECTIVENESS IS MEASURED USING SPOT RATES TO VALUE BOTH THE

HEDGE CONTRACT AND THE HEDGED ITEM.



EFFECTIVENESS FOR CURRENCY OPTIONS AND EQUITY OPTIONS WITH

HEDGE ACCOUNTING DESIGNATION

IS GENERALLY MEASURED BY

COMPARING THE CUMULATIVE CHANGE IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE HEDGE

CONTRACT WITH THE CUMULATIVE CHANGE IN THE FAIR VALUE OF AN

OPTION INSTRUMENT REPRESENTING THE HEDGED RISKS IN THE HEDGED

ITEM FOR CASH FLOW HEDGES. FOR FAIR VALUE HEDGES, TIME VALUE IS

EXCLUDED AND EFFECTIVENESS IS MEASURED BASED ON SPOT RATES TO

VALUE BOTH THE HEDGE CONTRACT AND THE HEDGED ITEM.



EFFECTIVENESS FOR INTEREST RATE SWAPS

IS GENERALLY

MEASURED BY COMPARING THE CHANGE IN FAIR VALUE OF THE HEDGED

ITEM WITH THE CHANGE IN FAIR VALUE OF THE INTEREST RATE SWAP.

ANY INEFFECTIVE PORTION OF THE HEDGES, AS WELL AS AMOUNTS

EXCLUDED FROM THE ASSESSMENT OF EFFECTIVENESS, ARE RECOGNIZED

CURRENTLY IN EARNINGS IN INTEREST AND OTHER, NET.

IF A CASH FLOW HEDGE WERE DISCONTINUED BECAUSE IT WAS NO LONGER

PROBABLE THAT THE ORIGINAL HEDGED TRANSACTION WOULD OCCUR AS

ANTICIPATED, THE UNREALIZED GAIN OR LOSS ON THE RELATED

DERIVATIVE WOULD BE RECLASSIFIED INTO EARNINGS. SUBSEQUENT GAINS

OR LOSSES ON THE RELATED DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENT WOULD BE

RECOGNIZED IN INCOME IN EACH PERIOD UNTIL THE INSTRUMENT

MATURES, IS TERMINATED, IS RE-DESIGNATED AS A QUALIFIED HEDGE,

OR IS SOLD. FOR ALL PERIODS PRESENTED, THE PORTION OF HEDGING

INSTRUMENTS GAINS OR LOSSES EXCLUDED FROM THE ASSESSMENT

OF EFFECTIVENESS AND THE INEFFECTIVE PORTIONS OF HEDGES HAD AN

INSIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON EARNINGS FOR BOTH CASH FLOW AND FAIR

VALUE HEDGES.

SECURITIES

LENDING

FROM TIME TO TIME, THE COMPANY ENTERS INTO SECURITIES LENDING

AGREEMENTS WITH FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, GENERALLY TO FACILITATE

HEDGING AND CERTAIN INVESTMENT TRANSACTIONS. SELECTED SECURITIES

MAY BE LOANED, SECURED BY COLLATERAL IN THE FORM OF CASH OR

SECURITIES. THE LOANED SECURITIES CONTINUE TO BE CARRIED AS

INVESTMENT ASSETS ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS. CASH

COLLATERAL IS RECORDED AS AN ASSET WITH A CORRESPONDING

LIABILITY. FOR LENDING AGREEMENTS COLLATERALIZED BY SECURITIES,

THE COLLATERAL IS NOT RECORDED AS AN ASSET OR A LIABILITY,

UNLESS THE COLLATERAL IS REPLEDGED.

INVENTORIES

INVENTORY COST IS COMPUTED ON A CURRENTLY ADJUSTED STANDARD

BASIS (WHICH APPROXIMATES ACTUAL COST ON AN AVERAGE OR

FIRST-IN,

FIRST-OUT BASIS). THE VALUATION OF INVENTORY REQUIRES THE

COMPANY TO ESTIMATE OBSOLETE OR EXCESS INVENTORY AS WELL AS

INVENTORY THAT IS NOT OF SALEABLE QUALITY. THE DETERMINATION OF

OBSOLETE OR EXCESS INVENTORY REQUIRES THE COMPANY TO ESTIMATE

THE FUTURE DEMAND FOR ITS PRODUCTS. INVENTORY IN EXCESS OF

SALEABLE AMOUNTS IS NOT VALUED, AND THE REMAINING INVENTORY IS

VALUED AT THE LOWER OF COST OR MARKET. DURING THE SECOND QUARTER

OF 2006, THE COMPANY COMPLETED A DEMAND FORECAST ACCURACY

ANALYSIS. AS A RESULT, THE DEMAND HORIZON NOW INCLUDES

ADDITIONAL WEEKS OF THE DEMAND FORECAST PERIOD FOR CERTAIN

PRODUCTS, COMPARED TO PRIOR YEARS, AND CONTINUES TO INCLUDE A

REVIEW OF PRODUCT-SPECIFIC FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES. THIS CHANGE

HELD FOR USE BY COMPARING THE PROJECTED UNDISCOUNTED NET CASH

FLOWS ASSOCIATED WITH THE RELATED ASSET OR GROUP OF ASSETS OVER

THEIR REMAINING LIVES AGAINST THEIR RESPECTIVE CARRYING AMOUNTS.

IMPAIRMENT, IF ANY, IS BASED ON THE EXCESS OF THE CARRYING

AMOUNT OVER THE FAIR VALUE OF THOSE ASSETS. IF ASSETS ARE

DETERMINED TO BE RECOVERABLE, BUT THE USEFUL LIVES ARE SHORTER

THAN ORIGINALLY ESTIMATED, THE NET BOOK VALUE OF THE ASSETS IS

DEPRECIATED OVER THE NEWLY DETERMINED REMAINING USEFUL LIVES.

IMPAIRMENT REVIEW FOR EACH REPORTING UNIT USING A FAIR VALUE

APPROACH. REPORTING UNITS MAY BE OPERATING SEGMENTS AS A WHOLE

OR AN OPERATION ONE LEVEL BELOW AN OPERATING SEGMENT, REFERRED

TO AS A COMPONENT. IN DETERMINING THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE

REPORTING UNIT, AN ALLOCATION OF THE COMPANYS

MANUFACTURING AND ASSEMBLY AND TEST ASSETS MUST BE MADE BECAUSE

OF THE INTERCHANGEABLE NATURE OF THE COMPANYS

MANUFACTURING AND ASSEMBLY AND TEST CAPACITY. THIS ALLOCATION IS

BASED ON EACH REPORTING UNITS RELATIVE PERCENTAGE

UTILIZATION OF THE MANUFACTURING AND ASSEMBLY AND TEST ASSETS.

IDENTIFIED

INTANGIBLE ASSETS

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY ASSETS PRIMARILY REPRESENT RIGHTS ACQUIRED

UNDER TECHNOLOGY LICENSES AND ARE GENERALLY AMORTIZED ON A

ACQUISITION-RELATED DEVELOPED TECHNOLOGY IS AMORTIZED ON A

STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER PERIODS RANGING FROM 4 TO 6 YEARS.

OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS INCLUDE ACQUISITION-RELATED CUSTOMER

LISTS AND

WORKFORCE-IN-PLACE,

WHICH ARE AMORTIZED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS, AND CUSTOMER

SUPPLY AGREEMENTS, WHICH ARE AMORTIZED BASED ON PRODUCT VOLUME.

OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS ARE AMORTIZED OVER PERIODS RANGING FROM

2 TO 6 YEARS. ALL IDENTIFIED INTANGIBLE ASSETS ARE CLASSIFIED

WITHIN OTHER LONG-TERM ASSETS ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE

SHEETS. IN THE QUARTER FOLLOWING THE PERIOD IN WHICH IDENTIFIED

INTANGIBLE ASSETS BECOME FULLY AMORTIZED, THE FULLY AMORTIZED

BALANCES ARE REMOVED FROM THE GROSS ASSET AND ACCUMULATED

AMORTIZATION AMOUNTS. FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION OF IDENTIFIED

INTANGIBLE ASSETS, SEE NOTE 16: IDENTIFIED INTANGIBLE

THE COMPANY PERFORMS A QUARTERLY REVIEW OF ITS IDENTIFIED

INTANGIBLE ASSETS TO DETERMINE IF FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES EXIST

WHICH INDICATE THAT THE USEFUL LIFE IS SHORTER THAN ORIGINALLY

ESTIMATED OR THAT THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF ASSETS MAY NOT BE

RECOVERABLE. IF SUCH FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES DO EXIST, THE

COMPANY ASSESSES THE RECOVERABILITY OF IDENTIFIED INTANGIBLE

ASSETS BY COMPARING THE PROJECTED UNDISCOUNTED NET CASH FLOWS

ASSOCIATED WITH THE RELATED ASSET OR GROUP OF ASSETS OVER THEIR

REMAINING LIVES AGAINST THEIR RESPECTIVE CARRYING AMOUNTS.

IMPAIRMENT, IF ANY, IS BASED ON THE EXCESS OF THE CARRYING

PRODUCT

WARRANTY

THE COMPANY GENERALLY SELLS PRODUCTS WITH A LIMITED WARRANTY OF

PRODUCT QUALITY AND A LIMITED INDEMNIFICATION OF CUSTOMERS

AGAINST INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY INFRINGEMENT CLAIMS RELATED TO THE

COMPANYS PRODUCTS. THE COMPANY ACCRUES FOR KNOWN WARRANTY

AND INDEMNIFICATION ISSUES IF A LOSS IS PROBABLE AND CAN BE

REASONABLY ESTIMATED, AND ACCRUES FOR ESTIMATED INCURRED BUT

UNIDENTIFIED ISSUES BASED ON HISTORICAL ACTIVITY. THE ACCRUAL

AND THE RELATED EXPENSE FOR KNOWN ISSUES WERE NOT SIGNIFICANT

DURING THE PERIODS PRESENTED. DUE TO PRODUCT TESTING AND THE

SHORT TIME TYPICALLY BETWEEN PRODUCT SHIPMENT AND THE DETECTION

AND CORRECTION OF PRODUCT FAILURES, AND CONSIDERING THE

HISTORICAL RATE OF PAYMENTS ON INDEMNIFICATION CLAIMS, THE

ACCRUAL AND RELATED EXPENSE FOR ESTIMATED INCURRED BUT

UNIDENTIFIED ISSUES WERE NOT SIGNIFICANT DURING THE PERIODS

PRESENTED.

REVENUE

RECOGNITION

THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES NET REVENUE WHEN THE EARNINGS PROCESS IS

COMPLETE, AS EVIDENCED BY AN AGREEMENT WITH THE CUSTOMER,

TRANSFER OF TITLE, AND ACCEPTANCE, IF APPLICABLE, AS WELL AS

FIXED PRICING AND PROBABLE COLLECTIBILITY. PRICING ALLOWANCES,

INCLUDING DISCOUNTS BASED ON CONTRACTUAL ARRANGEMENTS WITH

CUSTOMERS, ARE RECORDED WHEN REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED AS A

REDUCTION TO BOTH ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND REVENUE. BECAUSE OF

FREQUENT SALES PRICE REDUCTIONS AND RAPID TECHNOLOGY

OBSOLESCENCE IN THE INDUSTRY, SALES MADE TO DISTRIBUTORS UNDER

AGREEMENTS ALLOWING PRICE PROTECTION

AND/OR

RIGHT

OF RETURN ARE DEFERRED UNTIL THE DISTRIBUTORS SELL THE

EXTENT THAT AN ADVERTISING BENEFIT SEPARATE FROM THE REVENUE

TRANSACTION CAN BE IDENTIFIED AND THE CASH PAID DOES NOT EXCEED

THE FAIR VALUE OF THAT ADVERTISING BENEFIT RECEIVED. ANY EXCESS

EMPLOYEE

EQUITY INCENTIVE PLANS

THE COMPANY HAS EMPLOYEE EQUITY INCENTIVE PLANS, WHICH ARE

DESCRIBED MORE FULLY IN NOTE 3: EMPLOYEE EQUITY INCENTIVE

PLANS. EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2006, THE COMPANY ADOPTED THE

PROVISIONS OF SFAS NO. 123 (REVISED 2004), SHARE-BASED

PAYMENT (SFAS NO. 123(R)). SFAS NO. 123(R) REQUIRES

EMPLOYEE EQUITY AWARDS TO BE ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER THE FAIR VALUE

METHOD. ACCORDINGLY, SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION IS MEASURED AT THE

GRANT DATE, BASED ON THE FAIR VALUE OF THE AWARD. PRIOR TO

JANUARY 1, 2006, THE COMPANY ACCOUNTED FOR AWARDS GRANTED UNDER

ITS EQUITY INCENTIVE PLANS USING THE INTRINSIC VALUE METHOD

PRESCRIBED BY ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES BOARD (APB) OPINION NO. 25,

ACCOUNTING FOR STOCK ISSUED TO EMPLOYEES (APB NO.

25), AND RELATED INTERPRETATIONS, AND PROVIDED THE REQUIRED PRO

FORMA DISCLOSURES PRESCRIBED BY SFAS NO. 123, ACCOUNTING

FOR STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION (SFAS NO. 123), AS AMENDED.

THE EXERCISE PRICE OF OPTIONS IS EQUAL TO THE MARKET PRICE OF

INTEL COMMON STOCK (DEFINED AS THE AVERAGE OF THE HIGH AND LOW

TRADING PRICES REPORTED BY THE NASDAQ GLOBAL SELECT MARKET*) ON

THE DATE OF GRANT. ADDITIONALLY, THE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN WAS

DEEMED NON-COMPENSATORY UNDER APB NO. 25. ACCORDINGLY, NO

SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION, OTHER THAN INSIGNIFICANT AMOUNTS OF

ACQUISITION-RELATED COMPENSATION, WAS RECOGNIZED ON THE

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS PRIOR TO 2006.

UNDER THE MODIFIED PROSPECTIVE METHOD OF ADOPTION FOR SFAS NO.

123(R), THE COMPENSATION COST RECOGNIZED BY THE COMPANY

BEGINNING IN 2006 INCLUDES (A) COMPENSATION COST FOR ALL EQUITY

INCENTIVE AWARDS GRANTED PRIOR TO, BUT NOT YET VESTED AS OF

JANUARY 1, 2006, BASED ON THE GRANT-DATE FAIR VALUE ESTIMATED IN

ACCORDANCE WITH THE ORIGINAL PROVISIONS OF SFAS NO. 123, AND (B)

COMPENSATION COST FOR ALL EQUITY INCENTIVE AWARDS GRANTED

SUBSEQUENT TO JANUARY 1, 2006, BASED ON THE GRANT-DATE FAIR

VALUE ESTIMATED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE PROVISIONS OF SFAS NO.

123(R). THE COMPANY USES THE STRAIGHT-LINE ATTRIBUTION METHOD TO

RECOGNIZE SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION COSTS OVER THE SERVICE PERIOD

OF THE AWARD. UPON EXERCISE, CANCELLATION, FORFEITURE, OR

EXPIRATION OF STOCK OPTIONS, OR UPON VESTING OR FORFEITURE OF

RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS, DEFERRED TAX ASSETS FOR OPTIONS AND

RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS WITH MULTIPLE VESTING DATES ARE

ELIMINATED FOR EACH VESTING PERIOD ON A

FIRST-IN,

FIRST-OUT BASIS AS IF EACH VESTING PERIOD WAS A SEPARATE AWARD.

TO CALCULATE THE EXCESS TAX BENEFITS AVAILABLE AS OF THE DATE OF

ADOPTION FOR USE IN OFFSETTING FUTURE TAX SHORTFALLS, THE

COMPANY FOLLOWED THE ALTERNATIVE TRANSITION METHOD DISCUSSED IN

FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD (FASB) STAFF POSITION NO.

123(R)-3.

RECENT

ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

IN SEPTEMBER 2006, THE FASB ISSUED SFAS NO. 157, FAIR

VALUE MEASUREMENTS (SFAS NO. 157). THE PURPOSE OF SFAS NO.

157 IS TO DEFINE FAIR VALUE, ESTABLISH A FRAMEWORK FOR MEASURING

FAIR VALUE, AND ENHANCE DISCLOSURES ABOUT FAIR VALUE

MEASUREMENTS. THE MEASUREMENT AND DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS ARE

EFFECTIVE FOR THE COMPANY BEGINNING IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF

FISCAL YEAR 2008. THE COMPANY IS CURRENTLY EVALUATING THE IMPACT

THAT SFAS NO. 157 WILL HAVE ON ITS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS.

IN FEBRUARY 2007, THE FASB ISSUED SFAS NO. 159, THE

FAIR VALUE OPTION FOR FINANCIAL ASSETS AND FINANCIAL

LIABILITIES (SFAS NO. 159). SFAS NO. 159 PERMITS

COMPANIES TO CHOOSE TO MEASURE CERTAIN FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND

CERTAIN OTHER ITEMS AT FAIR VALUE. THE STANDARD REQUIRES THAT

UNREALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES ON ITEMS FOR WHICH THE FAIR VALUE

OPTION HAS BEEN ELECTED BE REPORTED IN EARNINGS. SFAS

NO. 159 IS EFFECTIVE FOR THE COMPANY BEGINNING IN THE FIRST

QUARTER OF FISCAL YEAR 2008, ALTHOUGH EARLIER ADOPTION IS

PERMITTED. THE COMPANY IS CURRENTLY EVALUATING THE IMPACT THAT

SFAS NO. 159 WILL HAVE ON ITS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS.

IN JUNE 2006, THE FASB ISSUED FASB INTERPRETATION NO. 48,

ACCOUNTING FOR UNCERTAINTY IN INCOME TAXESAN

INTERPRETATION OF FASB STATEMENT NO. 109 (FIN 48). THE

INTERPRETATION CONTAINS A TWO-STEP APPROACH TO RECOGNIZING AND

MEASURING UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS ACCOUNTED FOR IN ACCORDANCE

WITH SFAS NO. 109, ACCOUNTING FOR INCOME TAXES. THE

FIRST STEP IS TO EVALUATE THE TAX POSITION FOR RECOGNITION BY

DETERMINING IF THE WEIGHT OF AVAILABLE EVIDENCE INDICATES THAT

IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT THE POSITION WILL BE SUSTAINED

ON AUDIT, INCLUDING RESOLUTION OF RELATED APPEALS OR LITIGATION

PROCESSES, IF ANY. THE SECOND STEP IS TO MEASURE THE TAX BENEFIT

AS THE LARGEST AMOUNT WHICH IS MORE THAN 50% LIKELY OF BEING

REALIZED UPON ULTIMATE SETTLEMENT. THE COMPANY IS STILL

ASSESSING THE IMPACTS OF THE ADOPTION OF FIN 48. BASED ON A

PRELIMINARY ANALYSIS, MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT ADOPTION WILL

RESULT IN RECORDING AN INCREASE TO RETAINED EARNINGS OF BETWEEN

$150 MILLION AND $300 MILLION IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF

2007. HOWEVER, THE FINAL ANALYSIS WILL BE COMPLETED IN THE FIRST

QUARTER OF 2007.

PERIODS OR THROUGH A CUMULATIVE-EFFECT ADJUSTMENT TO RETAINED

EARNINGS. THE COMPANY INTENDS TO ADOPT

EITF 06-2

THROUGH A CUMULATIVE-EFFECT ADJUSTMENT AND ESTIMATES THAT THE

ADOPTION WILL RESULT IN AN ADDITIONAL LIABILITY OF APPROXIMATELY

APPROXIMATELY $175 MILLION IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2007.

NOTE 3.

EMPLOYEE EQUITY INCENTIVE PLANS

IN MAY 2006, STOCKHOLDERS APPROVED THE 2006 EQUITY INCENTIVE

PLAN (THE 2006 PLAN). UNDER THE 2006 PLAN, 175 MILLION

SHARES OF COMMON STOCK WERE MADE AVAILABLE FOR ISSUANCE AS

EQUITY AWARDS TO EMPLOYEES AND NON-EMPLOYEE DIRECTORS THROUGH

JUNE 2008, OF WHICH A MAXIMUM OF 80 MILLION SHARES CAN BE

AWARDED AS NON-VESTED SHARES (RESTRICTED STOCK) OR NON-VESTED

SHARE UNITS (RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS). THE 2006 PLAN ALLOWS FOR

TIME-BASED, PERFORMANCE-BASED, AND MARKET-BASED VESTING FOR

EQUITY INCENTIVE AWARDS. THE 2004 EQUITY INCENTIVE PLAN (THE

2004 PLAN) WAS TERMINATED UPON STOCKHOLDER APPROVAL OF THE 2006

PLAN. SHARES PREVIOUSLY AUTHORIZED FOR ISSUANCE UNDER THE 2004

PLAN ARE NO LONGER AVAILABLE FOR FUTURE GRANTS, ALTHOUGH OPTIONS

PREVIOUSLY GRANTED UNDER THE 2004 PLAN REMAIN OUTSTANDING. AS OF

DECEMBER 30, 2006, 162 MILLION SHARES REMAIN AVAILABLE FOR

FUTURE GRANT UNDER THE 2006 PLAN. INTEL MAY ASSUME THE EQUITY

INCENTIVE PLANS AND THE OUTSTANDING EQUITY AWARDS OF CERTAIN

ACQUIRED COMPANIES. ONCE ASSUMED, INTEL DOES NOT GRANT

ADDITIONAL STOCK UNDER THESE PLANS.

THE COMPANY BEGAN ISSUING RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS IN THE SECOND

QUARTER OF 2006. SHARES ARE ISSUED ON THE DATE THE RESTRICTED

STOCK UNITS VEST. THE MAJORITY OF SHARES ISSUED ARE NET OF THE

STATUTORY WITHHOLDING REQUIREMENTS THAT ARE PAID BY INTEL ON

BEHALF OF ITS EMPLOYEES. AS A RESULT, THE ACTUAL NUMBER OF

SHARES ISSUED WILL BE LESS THAN THE NUMBER OF RESTRICTED STOCK

UNITS GRANTED. PRIOR TO VESTING, RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS DO NOT

HAVE DIVIDEND EQUIVALENT RIGHTS, DO NOT HAVE VOTING RIGHTS, AND

THE SHARES UNDERLYING THE RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS ARE NOT

CONSIDERED ISSUED AND OUTSTANDING.

AWARDS GRANTED TO EMPLOYEES IN 2006 UNDER THE COMPANYS

SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION ON A QUARTERLY BASIS FOR CHANGES TO THE

ESTIMATE OF EXPECTED EQUITY AWARD FORFEITURES BASED ON A REVIEW

OF RECENT FORFEITURE ACTIVITY AND EXPECTED FUTURE EMPLOYEE

TURNOVER. THE EFFECT OF ADJUSTING THE FORFEITURE RATE FOR ALL

ESTIMATED VALUES AND ASSUMPTIONS USED IN THE CALCULATION OF

IN 2005, THE COMPANY REEVALUATED THE ASSUMPTIONS USED TO

ESTIMATE THE VALUE OF OPTIONS GRANTED UNDER THE COMPANYS

EQUITY INCENTIVE PLANS AND RIGHTS TO ACQUIRE STOCK GRANTED UNDER

THE COMPANYS STOCK PURCHASE PLAN. BEGINNING IN 2005, THE

COMPANY BASED THE EXPECTED VOLATILITY ON IMPLIED VOLATILITY, AS

MANAGEMENT DETERMINED THAT IMPLIED VOLATILITY IS MORE REFLECTIVE

OF MARKET CONDITIONS AND A BETTER INDICATOR OF EXPECTED

VOLATILITY THAN HISTORICAL VOLATILITY. ADDITIONALLY, BEGINNING

IN 2005, THE COMPANY BASED THE EXPECTED LIFE OF OPTIONS GRANTED

ON THE SIMPLIFIED CALCULATION OF EXPECTED LIFE, DESCRIBED IN THE

U.S. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSIONS STAFF ACCOUNTING

BULLETIN 107, DUE TO CHANGES IN THE VESTING TERMS AND

CONTRACTUAL LIFE OF CURRENT OPTION GRANTS COMPARED TO THE

COMPANYS HISTORICAL GRANTS. NO ADJUSTMENTS TO THE 2004

INPUT ASSUMPTIONS WERE MADE.

SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION RELATED TO RESTRICTED STOCK UNIT AWARDS

IS CALCULATED BASED ON THE MARKET PRICE OF INTEL COMMON STOCK ON

THE DATE OF GRANT, REDUCED BY THE PRESENT VALUE OF DIVIDENDS

EXPECTED TO BE PAID ON INTEL COMMON STOCK PRIOR TO VESTING OF

THE RESTRICTED STOCK UNIT. THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE ESTIMATED VALUES

OF RESTRICTED STOCK UNIT GRANTS, AS WELL AS THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE

THE DEBENTURES ARE INITIALLY CONVERTIBLE, SUBJECT TO CERTAIN

CONDITIONS, INTO SHARES OF THE COMPANYS COMMON STOCK AT A

CONVERSION RATE OF 31.7162 SHARES OF COMMON STOCK PER $1,000

PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF DEBENTURES, REPRESENTING AN INITIAL

EFFECTIVE CONVERSION PRICE OF APPROXIMATELY $31.53 PER

SHARE OF COMMON STOCK. HOLDERS MAY SURRENDER THE DEBENTURES FOR

CONVERSION AT ANY TIME. THE CONVERSION RATE WILL BE SUBJECT TO

ADJUSTMENT FOR CERTAIN EVENTS OUTLINED IN THE INDENTURE

GOVERNING THE DEBENTURES, BUT WILL NOT BE ADJUSTED FOR ACCRUED

INTEREST. IN ADDITION, THE CONVERSION RATE WILL INCREASE FOR A

HOLDER WHO ELECTS TO CONVERT THE DEBENTURES IN CONNECTION WITH

CERTAIN SHARE EXCHANGES, MERGERS, OR CONSOLIDATIONS INVOLVING

INTEL, AS DESCRIBED IN THE INDENTURE GOVERNING THE DEBENTURES.

THE DEBENTURES, WHICH PAY A FIXED RATE OF INTEREST SEMIANNUALLY,

HAVE A CONTINGENT INTEREST COMPONENT THAT WILL REQUIRE THE

COMPANY TO PAY INTEREST BASED ON CERTAIN THRESHOLDS AND FOR

CERTAIN EVENTS COMMENCING ON DECEMBER 15, 2010, AS OUTLINED IN

THE INDENTURE. THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT OF CONTINGENT INTEREST THAT

WILL ACCRUE IS 0.40% PER YEAR. THE FAIR VALUE OF THE RELATED

THE COMPANY MAY SETTLE ANY CONVERSION OR REPURCHASE OF THE

DEBENTURES IN CASH OR STOCK AT THE COMPANYS OPTION. ON OR

AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2012, THE COMPANY MAY REDEEM ALL OR PART

OF THE DEBENTURES FOR THE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT PLUS ANY ACCRUED AND

UNPAID INTEREST IF THE CLOSING PRICE OF THE COMPANYS

COMMON STOCK HAS BEEN AT LEAST 130% OF THE CONVERSION PRICE THEN

IN EFFECT FOR AT LEAST 20 TRADING DAYS DURING ANY 30 CONSECUTIVE

TRADING-DAY

PERIOD PRIOR TO THE DATE ON WHICH THE COMPANY PROVIDES NOTICE OF

PROVIDES THAT EACH HOLDER OF THE DEBENTURES MAY, FOR A

PRE-DEFINED PERIOD OF TIME, REQUIRE THE COMPANY TO REPURCHASE

THE HOLDERS DEBENTURES FOR THE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT PLUS ANY

ACCRUED AND UNPAID INTEREST. THE DEBENTURES ARE SUBORDINATED IN

RIGHT OF PAYMENT TO THE COMPANYS EXISTING AND FUTURE

SENIOR DEBT AND TO THE OTHER LIABILITIES OF THE COMPANYS

SUBSIDIARIES. THE COMPANY CONCLUDED THAT THE DEBENTURES ARE NOT

CONVENTIONAL CONVERTIBLE DEBT INSTRUMENTS AND THAT THE EMBEDDED

STOCK CONVERSION OPTION QUALIFIES AS A DERIVATIVE UNDER SFAS NO.

EMBEDDED CONVERSION OPTION IS NOT ACCOUNTED FOR SEPARATELY AS A

DERIVATIVE.

THE COMPANY HAS EURO BORROWINGS, WHICH WERE MADE IN CONNECTION

WITH THE FINANCING OF MANUFACTURING FACILITIES AND EQUIPMENT IN

IRELAND. THE COMPANY HAS INVESTED THE PROCEEDS IN

EURO-DENOMINATED LOAN PARTICIPATION NOTES OF SIMILAR MATURITY TO

COMPANY RETIRED APPROXIMATELY $300 MILLION OF THE EURO

BORROWINGS (APPROXIMATELY $280 MILLION DURING 2005) PRIOR TO

THEIR MATURITY DATES THROUGH THE SIMULTANEOUS SETTLEMENT OF AN

EQUIVALENT AMOUNT OF INVESTMENTS IN LOAN PARTICIPATION NOTES.

THE COMPANY HAS GUARANTEED REPAYMENT OF PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST

ON BONDS ISSUED BY THE INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY OF THE

CITY OF CHANDLER, ARIZONA (THE ARIZONA BONDS), WHICH CONSTITUTE

AN UNSECURED GENERAL OBLIGATION OF THE COMPANY. THE AGGREGATE

PRINCIPAL AMOUNT, INCLUDING THE PREMIUM, OF THE ARIZONA BONDS

ISSUED IN 2005 IS $160 MILLION DUE 2035, AND THE BONDS BEAR

INTEREST AT A FIXED RATE OF 4.375% UNTIL 2010. THE ARIZONA BONDS

ARE SUBJECT TO MANDATORY TENDER ON NOVEMBER 30, 2010, AT WHICH

TIME, AT THE COMPANYS OPTION, THE BONDS CAN BE RE-MARKETED

AS EITHER FIXED-RATE BONDS FOR A PERIOD OF A SPECIFIED DURATION

OR AS VARIABLE-RATE BONDS UNTIL THEIR FINAL MATURITY ON DECEMBER

1, 2035.

EQUITY SECURITIES

NON-MARKETABLE EQUITY SECURITIES CONSIST OF BOTH EQUITY METHOD

AND COST BASIS INVESTMENTS. AT DECEMBER 30, 2006, THE CARRYING

VALUES OF EQUITY METHOD AND COST BASIS INVESTMENTS WERE $2.0

BILLION AND $733 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. DURING 2006, THE

COMPANYS NON-MARKETABLE INVESTMENTS PRIMARILY CONSISTED OF

ITS INVESTMENTS IN IM FLASH TECHNOLOGIES, LLC (IMFT) AND

CLEARWIRE CORPORATION, WHICH WERE BOTH ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER THE

EQUITY METHOD. AT DECEMBER 31, 2005, THE CARRYING VALUES OF

EQUITY METHOD AND COST BASIS INVESTMENTS WERE $59 MILLION

AND $502 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. THE COMPANY RECOGNIZED

IMPAIRMENT LOSSES ON NON-MARKETABLE EQUITY SECURITIES OF

$79 MILLION IN 2006 ($103 MILLION IN 2005 AND $115 MILLION

IN 2004).

DURING 2006, INTEL AND MICRON FORMED IMFT, A NAND FLASH MEMORY

MANUFACTURING COMPANY, AND INVESTED $1.3 BILLION. SEE NOTE

17: VENTURE FOR FURTHER INFORMATION.

DURING 2006, INTEL PAID $600 MILLION IN CASH FOR AN INVESTMENT

IN CLEARWIRE. CLEARWIRE BUILDS AND OPERATES NEXT-GENERATION

WIRELESS BROADBAND NETWORKS. INTELS TOTAL INVESTMENT IN

CLEARWIRE IS $613 MILLION AS OF DECEMBER 30, 2006, WHICH

INCLUDES A PREVIOUS INVESTMENT. THIS INVESTMENT IS PART OF

INTELS STRATEGY TO SUPPORT THE DEVELOPMENT AND DEPLOYMENT

OF WIMAX NETWORKS. INTELS INVESTMENT IN CLEARWIRE IS

CLASSIFIED WITHIN OTHER LONG-TERM ASSETS ON THE CONSOLIDATED

BALANCE SHEET. INTEL ACCOUNTS FOR ITS INVESTMENT IN CLEARWIRE,

WHICH REPRESENTS AN OWNERSHIP INTEREST OF APPROXIMATELY 27%,

USING THE EQUITY METHOD OF ACCOUNTING; AND ITS PROPORTIONATE

SHARE OF LOSS WILL CONTINUE TO BE RECORDED ON A ONE-QUARTER LAG

WITHIN INTEREST AND OTHER, NET ON THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF

INCOME. AT THE DATE OF ACQUISITION, THE CARRYING VALUE OF

INTELS INVESTMENT IN CLEARWIRE EXCEEDED ITS SHARE OF THE

BOOK VALUE OF CLEARWIRES ASSETS BY $261 MILLION (SPLIT

BETWEEN EQUITY METHOD GOODWILL AND THE EXCESS OF FAIR VALUE OVER

BOOK VALUE), OF WHICH $52 MILLION IS BEING AMORTIZED WITH A

WEIGHTED AVERAGE REMAINING LIFE OF APPROXIMATELY 19 YEARS. THE

REMAINING BASIS DIFFERENCE REPRESENTS EQUITY METHOD GOODWILL AND

OUR SHARE OF THE EXCESS OF FAIR VALUE OVER BOOK VALUE OF

CLEARWIRES ASSETS HAVING INDEFINITE USEFUL LIVES. IN

ACCORDANCE WITH SFAS NO. 142, GOODWILL AND OTHER

INTANGIBLE ASSETS, AND APB OPINION NO. 18, THE

EQUITY METHOD OF ACCOUNTING FOR INVESTMENTS IN COMMON

STOCK (APB NO. 18), THIS EQUITY METHOD GOODWILL IS

NOT BEING AMORTIZED. INTEL REGULARLY REVIEWS THE CARRYING VALUE

OF THE INVESTMENT FOR IMPAIRMENT IN ACCORDANCE WITH APB NO. 18.

DURING 2006, THERE WERE NO IMPAIRMENT CHARGES RELATED TO THE

COMPANYS INVESTMENT IN CLEARWIRE.

CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS THAT POTENTIALLY SUBJECT THE COMPANY TO

CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK CONSIST PRINCIPALLY OF INVESTMENTS

IN DEBT SECURITIES, DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, AND TRADE

RECEIVABLES.

INTEL GENERALLY PLACES ITS INVESTMENTS WITH HIGH-CREDIT-QUALITY

COUNTERPARTIES AND, BY POLICY, LIMITS THE AMOUNT OF CREDIT

EXPOSURE TO ANY ONE COUNTERPARTY BASED ON INTELS ANALYSIS

OF THAT COUNTERPARTYS RELATIVE CREDIT STANDING.

INVESTMENTS IN DEBT SECURITIES WITH ORIGINAL MATURITIES OF

GREATER THAN SIX MONTHS CONSIST PRIMARILY OF A AND A2 OR BETTER

RATED FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND COUNTERPARTIES. INVESTMENTS WITH

ORIGINAL MATURITIES OF UP TO SIX MONTHS CONSIST PRIMARILY OF

A-1

AND

P-1

OR

BETTER RATED FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND COUNTERPARTIES.

GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS IMPOSED ON INVESTMENT ALTERNATIVES OF

INTELS

NON-U.S.

SUBSIDIARIES, OR THE ABSENCE OF A AND A2 RATED COUNTERPARTIES IN

CERTAIN COUNTRIES, RESULT IN SOME MINOR EXCEPTIONS, WHICH ARE

REVIEWED AND APPROVED ANNUALLY BY THE FINANCE COMMITTEE OF THE

BOARD OF DIRECTORS. CREDIT RATING CRITERIA FOR DERIVATIVE

INSTRUMENTS ARE SIMILAR TO THOSE FOR INVESTMENTS. THE AMOUNTS

SUBJECT TO CREDIT RISK RELATED TO DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS ARE

GENERALLY LIMITED TO THE AMOUNTS, IF ANY, BY WHICH A

COUNTERPARTYS OBLIGATIONS EXCEED THE OBLIGATIONS OF INTEL

WITH THAT COUNTERPARTY. AT DECEMBER 30, 2006, THE TOTAL CREDIT

EXPOSURE TO ANY SINGLE COUNTERPARTY DID NOT EXCEED $350 MILLION.

INTELS PRACTICE IS TO OBTAIN AND SECURE AVAILABLE

COLLATERAL FROM COUNTERPARTIES AGAINST OBLIGATIONS, INCLUDING

SECURITIES LENDING TRANSACTIONS, WHENEVER INTEL DEEMS

APPROPRIATE.

A SUBSTANTIAL MAJORITY OF THE COMPANYS TRADE RECEIVABLES

ARE DERIVED FROM SALES TO ORIGINAL EQUIPMENT MANUFACTURERS AND

ORIGINAL DESIGN MANUFACTURERS OF COMPUTER SYSTEMS, HANDHELD

DEVICES, AND NETWORKING AND COMMUNICATIONS EQUIPMENT. THE

COMPANY ALSO HAS ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE DERIVED FROM SALES TO

INDUSTRIAL AND RETAIL DISTRIBUTORS. THE COMPANYS TWO

LARGEST CUSTOMERS ACCOUNTED FOR 35% OF NET REVENUE FOR 2006,

2005, AND 2004. AT DECEMBER 30, 2006, THE TWO LARGEST CUSTOMERS

ACCOUNTED FOR 52% OF NET ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE (42% OF NET

ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AT DECEMBER 31, 2005). MANAGEMENT BELIEVES

THAT THE RECEIVABLE BALANCES FROM THESE LARGEST CUSTOMERS DO NOT

REPRESENT A SIGNIFICANT CREDIT RISK BASED ON CASH FLOW

FORECASTS, BALANCE SHEET ANALYSIS, AND PAST COLLECTION

EXPERIENCE.

THE COMPANY HAS ADOPTED CREDIT POLICIES AND STANDARDS INTENDED

TO ACCOMMODATE INDUSTRY GROWTH AND INHERENT RISK. MANAGEMENT

BELIEVES THAT CREDIT RISKS ARE MODERATED BY THE FINANCIAL

STABILITY OF THE COMPANYS END CUSTOMERS AND DIVERSE

GEOGRAPHIC SALES AREAS. TO ASSESS THE CREDIT RISK OF

COUNTERPARTIES, A QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE ANALYSIS IS

PERFORMED. FROM THIS ANALYSIS, CREDIT LIMITS ARE ESTABLISHED AND

A DETERMINATION IS MADE AS TO WHETHER ONE OR MORE CREDIT SUPPORT

DEVICES, SUCH AS OBTAINING SOME FORM OF THIRD-PARTY GUARANTEE OR

STANDBY LETTER OF CREDIT, OR OBTAINING CREDIT INSURANCE, FOR ALL

OR A PORTION OF THE ACCOUNT BALANCE IS NECESSARY.

RESTRUCTURING AND ASSET IMPAIRMENT CHARGES

INTEL IS UNDERTAKING A RESTRUCTURING PLAN DESIGNED TO IMPROVE

OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCY AND FINANCIAL RESULTS. IN THE THIRD

QUARTER OF 2006, MANAGEMENT APPROVED SEVERAL ACTIONS RELATED TO

THIS PLAN THAT WERE RECOMMENDED BY THE COMPANYS STRUCTURE

AND EFFICIENCY TASK FORCE. A PORTION OF THESE ACTIVITIES

INVOLVES COST SAVINGS OR OTHER ACTIONS THAT DO NOT RESULT IN

RESTRUCTURING CHARGES, SUCH AS BETTER UTILIZATION OF ASSETS,

REDUCED SPENDING, AND ORGANIZATIONAL EFFICIENCIES. THE

EFFICIENCY PROGRAM INCLUDES HEADCOUNT TARGETS FOR VARIOUS GROUPS

WITHIN THE COMPANY, AND WE EXPECT THESE TARGETS TO BE MET

THROUGH ONGOING EMPLOYEE ATTRITION, DIVESTITURES, AND EMPLOYEE

TERMINATIONS AS DETAILED BELOW.

DURING 2006, INTEL INCURRED RESTRUCTURING CHARGES RELATED TO

EMPLOYEE SEVERANCE AND BENEFIT ARRANGEMENTS FOR APPROXIMATELY

4,800 EMPLOYEES. A SUBSTANTIAL MAJORITY OF THESE EMPLOYEE

TERMINATIONS OCCURRED WITHIN MARKETING, MANUFACTURING,

INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY, AND HUMAN RESOURCES. ADDITIONALLY, INTEL

COMPLETED THE DIVESTITURE OF THE ASSETS OF THREE BUSINESSES IN

2006 CONCURRENTLY WITH THE ONGOING EXECUTION OF THE EFFICIENCY

PROGRAM. SEE NOTE 14: ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES

FOR FURTHER DETAILS. IN CONNECTION WITH THE DIVESTITURE OF

CERTAIN ASSETS OF THE COMMUNICATIONS AND APPLICATION PROCESSOR

BUSINESS, THE COMPANY RECORDED IMPAIRMENT CHARGES OF $103

MILLION RELATED TO THE WRITE-DOWN OF MANUFACTURING TOOLS TO

THEIR FAIR VALUE, LESS THE COST TO DISPOSE OF THE ASSETS. THE

FAIR VALUE WAS DETERMINED USING A MARKET-BASED VALUATION

TECHNIQUE. IN ADDITION, AS A RESULT OF BOTH THIS DIVESTITURE AND

A SUBSEQUENT ASSESSMENT OF INTELS WORLDWIDE MANUFACTURING

CAPACITY OPERATIONS, MANAGEMENT PLACED FOR SALE ITS FABRICATION

FACILITY IN COLORADO SPRINGS, COLORADO. THIS PLAN RESULTED IN AN

IMPAIRMENT CHARGE OF $214 MILLION TO WRITE DOWN TO FAIR VALUE

THE LAND, BUILDING, AND EQUIPMENT ASSET GROUPING THAT HAS BEEN

PRINCIPALLY USED TO SUPPORT THE COMMUNICATIONS AND APPLICATION

PROCESSOR BUSINESS. THE FAIR VALUE OF THE ASSET GROUPING WAS

DETERMINED USING VARIOUS VALUATION TECHNIQUES.

DURING 2004, IN CONNECTION WITH PREPARING AND FILING ITS 2003

FEDERAL TAX RETURN AND PREPARING ITS STATE TAX RETURNS, THE

COMPANY REDUCED ITS 2004 TAX PROVISION BY $195 MILLION. THIS

REDUCTION IN THE 2004 TAX PROVISION WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY TAX

BENEFITS FOR EXPORT SALES AND STATE TAX BENEFITS FOR

DIVESTITURES THAT EXCEEDED THE AMOUNTS ORIGINALLY ESTIMATED IN

CONNECTION WITH THE 2003 PROVISION. ALSO DURING 2004, THE

COMPANY REVERSED PREVIOUSLY ACCRUED TAXES RELATED PRIMARILY TO

THE CLOSING OF A STATE INCOME TAX AUDIT THAT REDUCED THE TAX

PROVISION FOR 2004 BY $62 MILLION.

THE U.S. INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE (IRS) HAS FORMALLY ASSESSED

CERTAIN ADJUSTMENTS TO THE AMOUNTS REFLECTED BY THE COMPANY IN

ITS TAX RETURNS AS A TAX BENEFIT FOR EXPORT SALES FOR THE YEARS

1999 THROUGH 2005. SEE NOTE 19: CONTINGENCIES FOR A

DISCUSSION OF THESE MATTERS.

DEFERRED TAX ASSET VALUATION ALLOWANCE WAS $87 MILLION AT

FORESEEABLE FUTURE. THE VALUATION ALLOWANCE IS COMPOSED OF

UNREALIZED STATE CAPITAL LOSS CARRY FORWARDS AND UNREALIZED

STATE CREDIT CARRY FORWARDS OF $79 MILLION, AND OPERATING LOSS

OF

NON-U.S.

SUBSIDIARIES OF $8 MILLION.

DURING 2004, THE COMPANY RECLASSIFIED $445 MILLION FROM DEFERRED

TAX LIABILITIES TO COMMON STOCK AND CAPITAL STOCK IN EXCESS OF

PAR VALUE. THE BALANCE SHEET RECLASSIFICATION REPRESENTED THE

TAX BENEFIT ATTRIBUTABLE TO CERTAIN PRIOR-YEAR STOCK OPTION

EXERCISES BY

NON-U.S. EMPLOYEES

AND HAD NO IMPACT ON THE ACCOMPANYING STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS.

AS OF DECEMBER 30, 2006, U.S. INCOME TAXES WERE NOT PROVIDED FOR

ON A CUMULATIVE TOTAL OF APPROXIMATELY $4.9 BILLION OF

UNDISTRIBUTED EARNINGS FOR CERTAIN

NON-U.S.

SUBSIDIARIES. DETERMINATION OF THE AMOUNT OF UNRECOGNIZED

DEFERRED TAX LIABILITY FOR TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES RELATED TO

INVESTMENTS IN THESE

NON-U.S.

SUBSIDIARIES THAT ARE ESSENTIALLY PERMANENT IN DURATION IS NOT

PRACTICABLE. THE COMPANY CURRENTLY INTENDS TO REINVEST THESE

EARNINGS IN OPERATIONS OUTSIDE THE U.S.

RETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS

PROFIT

SHARING PLANS

THE COMPANY PROVIDES TAX-QUALIFIED PROFIT SHARING RETIREMENT

PLANS FOR THE BENEFIT OF ELIGIBLE EMPLOYEES, FORMER EMPLOYEES,

AND RETIREES IN THE U.S. AND CERTAIN OTHER COUNTRIES. THE PLANS

ARE DESIGNED TO PROVIDE EMPLOYEES WITH AN ACCUMULATION OF FUNDS

FOR RETIREMENT ON A TAX-DEFERRED BASIS AND PROVIDE FOR ANNUAL

DISCRETIONARY EMPLOYER CONTRIBUTIONS. AMOUNTS TO BE CONTRIBUTED

TO THE U.S. PROFIT SHARING PLAN ARE DETERMINED BY THE CHIEF

EXECUTIVE OFFICER OF THE COMPANY UNDER DELEGATION OF AUTHORITY

FROM THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS, PURSUANT TO THE TERMS OF THE

U.S. PROFIT SHARING PLAN. AS OF DECEMBER 30, 2006,

APPROXIMATELY 80% OF THE ASSETS OF THE U.S. PROFIT SHARING PLAN

HAD BEEN ALLOCATED TO DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL EQUITIES INDEX

FUNDS, AND APPROXIMATELY 20% HAD BEEN ALLOCATED TO A

FIXED-INCOME FUND. ALL ASSETS ARE MANAGED BY EXTERNAL INVESTMENT

MANAGERS, CONSISTENT WITH THE PLANS INVESTMENT POLICY.

FOR THE BENEFIT OF ELIGIBLE U.S. EMPLOYEES, THE COMPANY ALSO

PROVIDES A NON-TAX-QUALIFIED SUPPLEMENTAL DEFERRED COMPENSATION

PLAN FOR CERTAIN HIGHLY COMPENSATED EMPLOYEES. THIS PLAN IS

DESIGNED TO PERMIT CERTAIN DISCRETIONARY EMPLOYER CONTRIBUTIONS

AND TO PERMIT EMPLOYEE DEFERRAL OF A PORTION OF SALARIES IN

EXCESS OF CERTAIN TAX LIMITS AND DEFERRAL OF BONUSES. THIS PLAN

IS UNFUNDED.

THE COMPANY EXPENSED $313 MILLION FOR THE QUALIFIED AND

NON-QUALIFIED U.S. PROFIT SHARING RETIREMENT PLANS IN 2006 ($355

MILLION IN 2005 AND $323 MILLION IN 2004). THE COMPANY FUNDED

$303 MILLION FOR THE 2006 CONTRIBUTION TO THE

U.S. QUALIFIED PROFIT SHARING PLAN AND $11 MILLION FOR THE

SUPPLEMENTAL DEFERRED COMPENSATION PLAN FOR CERTAIN HIGHLY

COMPENSATED EMPLOYEES.

CONTRIBUTIONS MADE BY THE COMPANY TO THE U.S. PROFIT SHARING

PLAN ON BEHALF OF THE EMPLOYEES VEST BASED ON THE

EMPLOYEES YEARS OF SERVICE. VESTING BEGINS AFTER THREE

YEARS OF SERVICE IN 20% ANNUAL INCREMENTS UNTIL THE EMPLOYEE IS

100% VESTED AFTER SEVEN YEARS, OR EARLIER IF THE EMPLOYEE

REACHES AGE 60.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

PENSION

AND POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS

EFFECTIVE FOR FISCAL YEAR 2006, THE COMPANY ADOPTED THE

PROVISIONS OF SFAS NO. 158. SFAS NO. 158 REQUIRES THAT THE

FUNDED STATUS OF DEFINED-BENEFIT POSTRETIREMENT PLANS BE

RECOGNIZED ON THE COMPANYS CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS,

AND CHANGES IN THE FUNDED STATUS BE REFLECTED IN COMPREHENSIVE

INCOME. SFAS NO. 158 ALSO REQUIRES THE MEASUREMENT DATE OF THE

PLANS FUNDED STATUS TO BE THE SAME AS THE COMPANYS

FISCAL YEAR-END. ALTHOUGH THE MEASUREMENT DATE PROVISION WAS NOT

REQUIRED TO BE ADOPTED UNTIL FISCAL YEAR 2008, THE COMPANY

EARLY-ADOPTED THIS PROVISION FOR FISCAL YEAR 2006. THE

MEASUREMENT DATE FOR ALL

NON-U.S.

PLANS WAS THE COMPANYS FISCAL YEAR-END, AND THE

MEASUREMENT DATE FOR THE U.S. PLAN WAS NOVEMBER. THEREFORE, THE

CHANGE IN MEASUREMENT DATE HAD AN INSIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE

PROJECTED BENEFIT OBLIGATION AND ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE

INCOME (LOSS). THE INCREMENTAL EFFECT OF APPLYING SFAS NO. 158

ON INDIVIDUAL LINE ITEMS ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET AS OF

DECEMBER 30, 2006 WAS AS FOLLOWS.

U.S. PENSION BENEFITS.

THE COMPANY PROVIDES A

TAX-QUALIFIED DEFINED-BENEFIT PENSION PLAN FOR THE BENEFIT OF

ELIGIBLE EMPLOYEES AND RETIREES IN THE U.S. THE PLAN PROVIDES

FOR A MINIMUM PENSION BENEFIT THAT IS DETERMINED BY A

PARTICIPANTS YEARS OF SERVICE AND FINAL AVERAGE

COMPENSATION (TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE PARTICIPANTS SOCIAL

SECURITY WAGE BASE), REDUCED BY THE PARTICIPANTS BALANCE

IN THE PROFIT SHARING PLAN. IF THE PENSION BENEFIT EXCEEDS THE

PARTICIPANTS BALANCE IN THE PROFIT SHARING PLAN, THE

PARTICIPANT WILL RECEIVE A COMBINATION OF PENSION AND PROFIT

SHARING AMOUNTS EQUAL TO THE PENSION BENEFIT. HOWEVER, THE

PARTICIPANT WILL RECEIVE ONLY THE BENEFIT FROM THE PROFIT

SHARING PLAN IF THAT BENEFIT IS GREATER THAN THE VALUE OF THE

PENSION BENEFIT. IF THE COMPANY DOES NOT CONTINUE TO CONTRIBUTE

TO, OR SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCES CONTRIBUTIONS TO, THE PROFIT

SHARING PLAN, THE U.S. DEFINED-BENEFIT PLAN PROJECTED BENEFIT

OBLIGATION COULD INCREASE SIGNIFICANTLY. THE U.S.

DEFINED-BENEFIT PLAN PROJECTED BENEFIT OBLIGATION FOR PRIOR

YEARS HAS BEEN ADJUSTED TO REMOVE THE EFFECTS OF ESTIMATED

ASSUMED FUTURE PROFIT SHARING CONTRIBUTIONS AND RETURN ON

INVESTMENTS. THIS CHANGE DID NOT SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS; HOWEVER, THE BEGINNING BENEFIT OBLIGATION FOR 2005

WAS ADJUSTED BY $80 MILLION.

IN 2005, THE COMPANY RECEIVED A FAVORABLE DETERMINATION LETTER

FROM THE IRS APPROVING AN AMENDMENT TO THE U.S. DEFINED-BENEFIT

PLAN THAT WAS FILED DURING 2004. EFFECTIVE FOR THE PLAN YEAR

ENDED 2005, THE AMENDMENT ALLOWS FOR A PORTION OF THE

SUPPLEMENTAL DEFERRED COMPENSATION PLAN LIABILITY, FOR CERTAIN

HIGHLY COMPENSATED EMPLOYEES, TO BE INCLUDED WITH THE U.S.

DEFINED-BENEFIT PLAN UNDER SECTION 415 OF THE INTERNAL REVENUE

CODE. THE AMENDMENT INCREASED THE PROJECTED BENEFIT OBLIGATION

AND ACCUMULATED BENEFIT OBLIGATION BY APPROXIMATELY $199

MILLION. IN 2005, THE COMPANY FUNDED THE U.S. DEFINED-BENEFIT

PLAN RELATED TO THIS AMENDMENT IN ACCORDANCE WITH APPLICABLE

FUNDING LAWS.

NON-U.S.

PENSION BENEFITS.

THE COMPANY ALSO PROVIDES

DEFINED-BENEFIT PENSION PLANS IN CERTAIN OTHER COUNTRIES.

CONSISTENT WITH THE REQUIREMENTS OF LOCAL LAW, THE COMPANY

DEPOSITS FUNDS FOR CERTAIN OF THESE PLANS WITH INSURANCE

COMPANIES, THIRD-PARTY TRUSTEES, OR INTO GOVERNMENT-MANAGED

ACCOUNTS,

AND/OR

ACCRUES FOR THE UNFUNDED PORTION OF THE OBLIGATION. THE

ASSUMPTIONS USED IN CALCULATING THE OBLIGATION FOR THE

NON-U.S.

PLANS DEPEND ON THE LOCAL ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT.

POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL BENEFITS.

UPON RETIREMENT,

ELIGIBLE U.S. EMPLOYEES ARE CREDITED WITH A DEFINED DOLLAR

AMOUNT BASED ON YEARS OF SERVICE. THESE CREDITS CAN BE USED TO

PAY ALL OR A PORTION OF THE COST TO PURCHASE COVERAGE IN AN

INTEL-SPONSORED MEDICAL PLAN. IF THE AVAILABLE CREDITS ARE NOT

SUFFICIENT TO PAY THE ENTIRE COST OF THE COVERAGE, THE REMAINING

COST IS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE RETIREE.

FUNDING POLICY.

THE COMPANYS PRACTICE IS TO

FUND THE VARIOUS PENSION PLANS IN AMOUNTS AT LEAST SUFFICIENT TO

MEET THE MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS OF U.S. FEDERAL LAWS AND

REGULATIONS OR APPLICABLE LOCAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS. THE ASSETS

OF THE VARIOUS PLANS ARE INVESTED IN CORPORATE EQUITIES,

CORPORATE DEBT SECURITIES, GOVERNMENT SECURITIES, AND OTHER

INSTITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENTS. THE PORTFOLIO OF EACH PLAN DEPENDS

ON PLAN DESIGN AND APPLICABLE LOCAL LAWS. DEPENDING ON THE

DESIGN OF THE PLAN, LOCAL CUSTOMS, AND MARKET CIRCUMSTANCES, THE

LIABILITIES OF A PLAN MAY EXCEED QUALIFIED PLAN ASSETS. THE

COMPANY ACCRUES FOR ALL SUCH LIABILITIES.

FOR THE U.S. PLAN, THE DISCOUNT RATE WAS DEVELOPED BY

WHEN BENEFIT PAYMENTS WILL BE DUE. THE BENEFIT PAYMENT STREAMS

WERE THEN MATCHED BY YEAR TO U.S. TREASURY ZERO COUPON STRIPS TO

MATCH THE TIMING AND AMOUNT OF THE EXPECTED BENEFIT PAYMENTS.

THE COMPANY ADJUSTED THE ZERO COUPON RATE BY A HISTORICAL CREDIT

RISK SPREAD, AND DISCOUNTED IT BACK TO THE MEASUREMENT DATE TO

DETERMINE THE APPROPRIATE DISCOUNT RATE. FOR THE

NON-U.S.

PLANS, THE DISCOUNT RATE WAS DEVELOPED BY ANALYZING LONG-TERM

BOND RATES AND MATCHING THE BOND MATURITY WITH THE AVERAGE

DURATION OF THE PENSION LIABILITIES. SEVERAL FACTORS ARE

CONSIDERED IN DEVELOPING THE ASSET RETURN ASSUMPTIONS FOR THE

U.S. AND

NON-U.S.

COUNTRY WHERE EACH PLAN IS IN EFFECT AND THE INVESTMENTS

DURING 2006, THE COMPANY COMPLETED THREE DIVESTITURES, WHICH

RESULTED IN A REDUCTION OF $12 MILLION IN GOODWILL. SEE

NOTE 14: ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES FOR FURTHER

DETAILS.

DURING 2005, THE COMPANY COMPLETED THREE ACQUISITIONS FOR TOTAL

PURCHASE CONSIDERATION, NET OF CASH ACQUIRED, OF $177 MILLION,

PLUS LIABILITIES ASSUMED, WHICH RESULTED IN GOODWILL OF $165

MILLION. THE OPERATING RESULTS OF THE ACQUIRED COMPANIES HAVE

BEEN REPORTED IN THE ALL OTHER CATEGORY FROM THE

DATE OF ACQUISITION.

DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2005, THE COMPANY REORGANIZED ITS

BUSINESS GROUPS TO BRING ALL MAJOR PRODUCT GROUPS IN LINE WITH

THE COMPANYS STRATEGY TO DESIGN AND DELIVER TECHNOLOGY

PLATFORMS. DUE TO THIS REORGANIZATION OF THE COMPANYS

BUSINESS GROUPS DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2005, GOODWILL WAS

ALLOCATED TO THE NEW REPORTING UNITS BASED ON THE ESTIMATED FAIR

VALUE OF EACH BUSINESS GROUP WITHIN ITS ORIGINAL REPORTING UNIT

RELATIVE TO THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF THAT REPORTING UNIT. IN

THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2005, THE COMPANY ADDED THE FLASH MEMORY

GROUP (FMG). AS THE FLASH PRODUCTS GROUP WAS A SEPARATE

REPORTING UNIT IN THE MOBILITY GROUP, WITH NO GOODWILL ASSIGNED,

THE TRANSFER OF THE FLASH PRODUCTS GROUP TO FMG DID NOT CHANGE

THE GOODWILL RECORDED WITHIN THE OPERATING SEGMENTS. THE

MAJORITY OF THE ALL OTHER CATEGORY GOODWILL IS

INCLUDED IN THE DIGITAL HOME GROUP OPERATING SEGMENT, WHICH IS

ALSO A REPORTING UNIT.

DURING 2006, 2005, AND 2004, THE COMPANY CONCLUDED THAT GOODWILL

WAS NOT IMPAIRED.

DURING 2005, THE COMPANY ACQUIRED INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY ASSETS

FOR $209 MILLION WITH A WEIGHTED AVERAGE LIFE OF NINE YEARS. THE

MAJORITY OF THE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY ASSETS ACQUIRED

REPRESENTED THE VALUE OF ASSETS CAPITALIZED AS A RESULT OF A

SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT WITH MICROUNITY, INC. PURSUANT TO THE

AGREEMENT, INTEL AGREED TO PAY MICROUNITY A TOTAL OF $300

MILLION, OF WHICH $140 MILLION WAS CHARGED TO COST OF SALES, IN

EXCHANGE FOR A TECHNOLOGY LICENSE. THE CHARGE TO COST OF SALES

RELATED TO THE PORTION OF THE LICENSE ATTRIBUTABLE TO CERTAIN

PRODUCT SALES THROUGH THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2005. THE REMAINING

$160 MILLION REPRESENTED THE VALUE OF THE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

ASSETS CAPITALIZED AND IS BEING AMORTIZED OVER THE ASSETS

REMAINING USEFUL LIVES.

ALL OF THE COMPANYS IDENTIFIED INTANGIBLE ASSETS ARE

SUBJECT TO AMORTIZATION. AMORTIZATION OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

ASSETS WAS $178 MILLION IN 2006 ($123 MILLION IN 2005 AND

$120 MILLION IN 2004). THE AMORTIZATION OF AN INTELLECTUAL

PROPERTY ASSET IS GENERALLY INCLUDED IN COST OF SALES ON THE

CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME. AMORTIZATION OF

ACQUISITION-RELATED DEVELOPED TECHNOLOGY WAS $20 MILLION

FOR 2006 ($86 MILLION FOR 2005 AND $122 MILLION FOR

2004) AND IS INCLUDED IN AMORTIZATION OF ACQUISITION-RELATED

INTANGIBLES AND COSTS ON THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME.

AMORTIZATION OF OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS WAS $59 MILLION IN 2006

($32 MILLION IN 2005 AND $28 MILLION IN 2004). THE

AMORTIZATION OF OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS IS RECORDED AS EITHER

AMORTIZATION OF ACQUISITION-RELATED INTANGIBLES AND COSTS OR AS

A REDUCTION OF REVENUE ON THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME.

BASED ON IDENTIFIED INTANGIBLE ASSETS RECORDED AT DECEMBER 30,

2006, AND ASSUMING NO SUBSEQUENT IMPAIRMENT OF THE UNDERLYING

ASSETS, THE ANNUAL AMORTIZATION EXPENSE FOR EACH PERIOD IS

$615 MILLION IN CASH AND ISSUED $581 MILLION IN

NON-INTEREST-BEARING NOTES IN EXCHANGE FOR A 49% INTEREST.

DURING 2006, INTEL PAID THE ENTIRE BALANCE OF $581 MILLION

TOWARD THE NON-INTEREST-BEARING NOTES, WHICH HAS BEEN REFLECTED

AS A FINANCING ACTIVITY ON THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF CASH

FLOWS. AT INCEPTION, IN EXCHANGE FOR A 51% INTEREST, MICRON

CONTRIBUTED ASSETS VALUED AT $995 MILLION AND $250 MILLION IN

CASH. INTEL IS CURRENTLY COMMITTED TO PURCHASING 49% OF

IMFTS PRODUCTION OUTPUT AND PRODUCTION-RELATED SERVICES.

APPROXIMATELY $300 MILLION AND THE RELATED PAYABLE AS OF

DECEMBER 30, 2006 WAS NOT SIGNIFICANT.

IMFT IS GOVERNED BY A BOARD OF MANAGERS, WITH INTEL AND MICRON

INITIALLY APPOINTING AN EQUAL NUMBER OF MANAGERS TO THE BOARD OF

MANAGERS. THE NUMBER OF MANAGERS APPOINTED BY EACH PARTY ADJUSTS

DEPENDING ON THE PARTIES OWNERSHIP INTERESTS IN IMFT. IMFT

WILL OPERATE UNTIL 2015, BUT IS SUBJECT TO PRIOR TERMINATION

UNDER CERTAIN TERMS AND CONDITIONS.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

SUBJECT TO CERTAIN CONDITIONS, INTEL AND MICRON EACH AGREED TO

CONTRIBUTE AN ADDITIONAL $1.4 BILLION IN THE THREE YEARS

FOLLOWING THE INITIAL CAPITAL CONTRIBUTIONS, OF WHICH INTEL HAD

CONTRIBUTED $128 MILLION AS OF DECEMBER 30, 2006. IN JANUARY

2007, INTEL MADE AN ADDITIONAL CAPITAL CONTRIBUTION TO IMFT OF

$258 MILLION.

IMFT IS A VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITY AS DEFINED BY FASB

INTERPRETATION NO. 46(R), CONSOLIDATION OF VARIABLE

INTEREST ENTITIES (REVISED DECEMBER 2003)AN INTERPRETATION

OF ARB NO. 51 (FIN 46(R)), BECAUSE ALL POSITIVE AND

NEGATIVE VARIANCES IN IMFTS COST STRUCTURE ARE PASSED ON

TO INTEL AND MICRON THROUGH THEIR PURCHASE AGREEMENT WITH IMFT.

MICRON AND INTEL ARE CONSIDERED RELATED PARTIES UNDER THE

PROVISIONS OF FIN 46(R), AND INTEL HAS DETERMINED THAT INTEL IS

NOT THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY OF IMFT. INTEL ACCOUNTS FOR ITS

INTEREST IN IMFT USING THE EQUITY METHOD OF ACCOUNTING.

INTELS PROPORTIONATE SHARE OF INCOME OR LOSSES FROM ITS

INVESTMENT IN IMFT IS RECORDED IN INTEREST AND OTHER, NET.

INTELS MAXIMUM EXPOSURE TO LOSS AS A RESULT OF ITS

INVOLVEMENT WITH IMFT IS $1.3 BILLION AS OF DECEMBER 30,

2006, WHICH REPRESENTS INTELS INVESTMENT. INTELS

INVESTMENT IN IMFT IS CLASSIFIED WITHIN OTHER LONG-TERM ASSETS

ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET.

CONCURRENT WITH THE FORMATION OF IMFT, INTEL PAID MICRON $270

MILLION FOR PRODUCT DESIGNS DEVELOPED BY MICRON AS WELL AS

CERTAIN OTHER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY. INTEL OWNS THE RIGHTS WITH

RESPECT TO ALL PRODUCT DESIGNS AND LICENSED THE DESIGNS TO

MICRON. MICRON PAID INTEL $40 MILLION TO LICENSE THESE

INITIAL PRODUCT DESIGNS AND WILL PAY ADDITIONAL ROYALTIES ON NEW

PRODUCT DESIGNS. INTEL RECORDED ITS NET INVESTMENT IN THIS

TECHNOLOGY OF $230 MILLION AS AN IDENTIFIED INTANGIBLE ASSET,

WHICH IS INCLUDED IN THE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY ASSET

CLASSIFICATION. THE IDENTIFIED INTANGIBLE ASSET WILL BE

AMORTIZED INTO COST OF SALES OVER ITS EXPECTED FIVE-YEAR LIFE.

COSTS INCURRED BY INTEL AND MICRON FOR PRODUCT AND PROCESS

DEVELOPMENT RELATED TO IMFT ARE GENERALLY SPLIT EVENLY BETWEEN

INTEL AND MICRON AND ARE CLASSIFIED AS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

ON THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME.

INTEL HAS ENTERED INTO A LONG-TERM SUPPLY AGREEMENT WITH APPLE

INC. TO SUPPLY A PORTION OF THE NAND FLASH MEMORY OUTPUT THAT

INTEL WILL PURCHASE FROM IMFT THROUGH DECEMBER 31, 2010. IN

JANUARY 2006, APPLE PRE-PAID A REFUNDABLE $250 MILLION TO INTEL

THAT WILL BE APPLIED TO PURCHASES OF NAND FLASH MEMORY BY APPLE

BEGINNING IN 2008. INTEL HAS CLASSIFIED THE $250 MILLION AS

OTHER LONG-TERM LIABILITIES ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET.

COMMITMENTS

THE COMPANY LEASES A PORTION OF ITS CAPITAL EQUIPMENT AND

CERTAIN OF ITS FACILITIES UNDER OPERATING LEASES THAT EXPIRE AT

VARIOUS DATES THROUGH 2021. ADDITIONALLY, THE COMPANY LEASES

PORTIONS OF ITS LAND THAT EXPIRE AT VARIOUS DATES THROUGH 2062.

RENTAL EXPENSE WAS $160 MILLION IN 2006 ($150 MILLION IN

2005 AND $136 MILLION IN 2004). MINIMUM RENTAL COMMITMENTS UNDER

ALL NON-CANCELABLE LEASES WITH AN INITIAL TERM IN EXCESS OF ONE

YEAR ARE PAYABLE AS FOLLOWS: 2007$114 MILLION;

2008$80 MILLION; 2009$58 MILLION;

2010$33 MILLION; 2011$24 MILLION; 2012 AND

PURCHASE OF PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT INCREASED FROM $2.7

BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2005 TO $3.3 BILLION AT DECEMBER 30,

2006, PRIMARILY DUE TO PURCHASE OBLIGATIONS FOR CAPITAL

EQUIPMENT RELATED TO OUR NEXT-GENERATION 45-NANOMETER PROCESS

TECHNOLOGY. OTHER PURCHASE OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS AS OF

DECEMBER 30, 2006 TOTALED $1.8 BILLION. OTHER PURCHASE

OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS INCLUDE AGREEMENTS TO PURCHASE RAW

MATERIAL OR OTHER GOODS AS WELL AS PAYMENTS DUE UNDER VARIOUS

TYPES OF LICENSES AND NON-CONTINGENT FUNDING OBLIGATIONS.

FUNDING OBLIGATIONS INCLUDE, FOR EXAMPLE, AGREEMENTS TO FUND

VARIOUS PROJECTS WITH OTHER COMPANIES. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY

HAS VARIOUS CONTRACTUAL COMMITMENTS RELATED TO THE IMFT VENTURE

WITH MICRON (SEE NOTE 17: VENTURE).

NOTE 19.

CONTINGENCIES

TAX

MATTERS

IN CONNECTION WITH THE REGULAR EXAMINATION OF INTELS TAX

RETURNS FOR THE YEARS 1999 THROUGH 2005, THE IRS FORMALLY

ASSESSED, IN 2005 AND 2006, CERTAIN ADJUSTMENTS TO THE AMOUNTS

REFLECTED BY INTEL ON THOSE RETURNS AS A TAX BENEFIT FOR ITS

EXPORT SALES. THE COMPANY DOES NOT AGREE WITH THESE ADJUSTMENTS

AND HAS APPEALED THE ASSESSMENTS. IF THE IRS PREVAILS IN ITS

POSITION, INTELS FEDERAL INCOME TAX DUE FOR 1999 THROUGH

2005 WOULD INCREASE BY APPROXIMATELY $2.2 BILLION, PLUS

INTEREST. IN ADDITION, THE IRS WILL LIKELY MAKE A SIMILAR CLAIM

FOR 2006, AND IF THE IRS PREVAILS, INCOME TAX DUE FOR 2006 WOULD

INCREASE BY APPROXIMATELY $200 MILLION, PLUS INTEREST.

INTEL IS ALSO SUBJECT TO CERTAIN ANTITRUST REGULATORY INQUIRIES.

IN 2001, THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION COMMENCED AN INVESTIGATION

REGARDING CLAIMS BY AMD THAT INTEL USED UNFAIR BUSINESS

PRACTICES TO PERSUADE CLIENTS TO BUY INTEL MICROPROCESSORS. IN

JUNE 2005, INTEL RECEIVED AN INQUIRY FROM THE KOREA FAIR TRADE

COMMISSION REQUESTING DOCUMENTS FROM INTELS KOREAN

SUBSIDIARY RELATED TO MARKETING AND REBATE PROGRAMS THAT INTEL

ENTERED INTO WITH KOREAN PC MANUFACTURERS. INTEL IS COOPERATING

WITH THESE AGENCIES IN THEIR INVESTIGATIONS AND EXPECTS THAT

THESE MATTERS WILL BE ACCEPTABLY RESOLVED.

IN JUNE 2002, VARIOUS PLAINTIFFS FILED A LAWSUIT IN THE THIRD

JUDICIAL CIRCUIT COURT, MADISON COUNTY, ILLINOIS, AGAINST INTEL,

PROCESSORS ARE LESS POWERFUL AND SLOWER THAN SYSTEMS CONTAINING

INTEL PENTIUM

III

PROCESSORS AND A COMPETITORS MICROPROCESSORS. IN JULY

2004, THE COURT CERTIFIED AGAINST INTEL AN ILLINOIS-ONLY CLASS

OF CERTAIN END-USE PURCHASERS OF CERTAIN PENTIUM 4

PROCESSORS OR COMPUTERS CONTAINING SUCH MICROPROCESSORS. IN

JANUARY 2005, THE CIRCUIT COURT GRANTED A MOTION FILED JOINTLY

BY THE PLAINTIFFS AND INTEL THAT STAYED THE PROCEEDINGS IN THE

TRIAL COURT PENDING DISCRETIONARY APPELLATE REVIEW OF THE

CIRCUIT COURTS CLASS CERTIFICATION ORDER. IN JULY 2006,

THE ILLINOIS APPELLATE COURT, FIFTH DISTRICT, VACATED THE

CIRCUIT COURTS CLASS CERTIFICATION ORDER AND REMANDED THE

CASE TO THE CIRCUIT COURT WITH INSTRUCTIONS TO RECONSIDER ITS

CLASS CERTIFICATION RULING. IN AUGUST 2006, THE ILLINOIS SUPREME

COURT AGREED TO REVIEW THE APPELLATE COURTS DECISION, AND

THAT REVIEW IS PENDING. THE PLAINTIFFS SEEK UNSPECIFIED DAMAGES

AND ATTORNEYS FEES AND COSTS. THE COMPANY DISPUTES THE

PLAINTIFFS CLAIMS AND INTENDS TO DEFEND THE LAWSUIT

VIGOROUSLY.

BEGINNING IN MAY 2005, INTEL AND AMBERWAVE SYSTEMS CORPORATION

FILED A SERIES OF LAWSUITS AGAINST EACH OTHER THAT WERE

CONSOLIDATED INTO ACTIONS IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT

RESOURCES TO AND ASSESSES THE PERFORMANCE OF EACH OPERATING

SEGMENT USING INFORMATION ABOUT ITS REVENUE AND OPERATING INCOME

(LOSS) BEFORE INTEREST AND TAXES.

THE COMPANY REPORTS THE FINANCIAL RESULTS OF THE FOLLOWING

OPERATING SEGMENTS.



DIGITAL ENTERPRISE GROUP.

INCLUDES MICROPROCESSORS

AND RELATED CHIPSETS AND MOTHERBOARDS DESIGNED FOR THE DESKTOP

GROUP, AND CHANNEL PLATFORMS GROUP OPERATING SEGMENTS DO NOT

MEET THE QUANTITATIVE THRESHOLDS FOR REPORTABLE SEGMENTS AS

DEFINED BY SFAS NO. 131. HOWEVER, THE FLASH MEMORY GROUP IS

REPORTED SEPARATELY, AS MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT THIS

INFORMATION IS USEFUL TO THE READER. THE DIGITAL HOME GROUP,

DIGITAL HEALTH GROUP, AND CHANNEL PLATFORMS GROUP OPERATING

SEGMENTS ARE INCLUDED WITHIN THE ALL OTHER CATEGORY.

THE COMPANY HAS SALES AND MARKETING, MANUFACTURING, FINANCE, AND

ADMINISTRATION GROUPS. EXPENSES OF THESE GROUPS ARE GENERALLY

ALLOCATED TO THE OPERATING SEGMENTS AND ARE INCLUDED IN THE

INTEREST AND OTHER INCOME, INTEREST EXPENSE, OR TAXES TO

OPERATING SEGMENTS. ALTHOUGH THE CODM USES OPERATING INCOME TO

EVALUATE THE SEGMENTS, OPERATING COSTS INCLUDED IN ONE SEGMENT

MAY BENEFIT OTHER SEGMENTS. EXCEPT AS DISCUSSED ABOVE, THE

ACCOUNTING POLICIES FOR SEGMENT REPORTING ARE THE SAME AS FOR

INCLUDED THE FINANCIAL STATEMENT SCHEDULE LISTED IN THE INDEX AT

PART IV, ITEM 15. THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SCHEDULE ARE

WE CONDUCTED OUR AUDITS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE STANDARDS OF THE

STANDARDS REQUIRE THAT WE PLAN AND PERFORM THE AUDIT TO OBTAIN

REASONABLE ASSURANCE ABOUT WHETHER THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE

FREE OF MATERIAL MISSTATEMENT. AN AUDIT INCLUDES EXAMINING, ON A

TEST BASIS, EVIDENCE SUPPORTING THE AMOUNTS AND DISCLOSURES IN

THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. AN AUDIT ALSO INCLUDES ASSESSING THE

ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES USED AND SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES MADE BY

MANAGEMENT, AS WELL AS EVALUATING THE OVERALL FINANCIAL

STATEMENT PRESENTATION. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR AUDITS PROVIDE A

REASONABLE BASIS FOR OUR OPINION.

IN OUR OPINION, THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS REFERRED TO ABOVE

DECEMBER 31, 2005, AND THE CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF ITS

OPERATIONS AND ITS CASH FLOWS FOR EACH OF THE THREE YEARS IN THE

PERIOD ENDED DECEMBER 30, 2006, IN CONFORMITY WITH U.S.

GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES. ALSO, IN OUR OPINION,

THE RELATED FINANCIAL STATEMENT SCHEDULE, WHEN CONSIDERED IN

RELATION TO THE BASIC FINANCIAL STATEMENTS TAKEN AS A WHOLE,

PRESENTS FAIRLY IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS THE INFORMATION SET

FORTH THEREIN.

WE ALSO HAVE AUDITED, IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE STANDARDS OF THE

REPORT OF

ERNST & YOUNG LLP, INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING

FIRM

THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND STOCKHOLDERS, INTEL

CORPORATION

WE HAVE AUDITED MANAGEMENTS ASSESSMENT, INCLUDED IN THE

ACCOMPANYING MANAGEMENT REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER

FINANCIAL REPORTING, THAT INTEL CORPORATION MAINTAINED EFFECTIVE

INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF DECEMBER 30,

2006, BASED ON CRITERIA ESTABLISHED IN INTERNAL

CONTROLINTEGRATED FRAMEWORK ISSUED BY THE COMMITTEE OF

SPONSORING ORGANIZATIONS OF THE TREADWAY COMMISSION (THE COSO

CRITERIA). INTEL CORPORATIONS MANAGEMENT IS RESPONSIBLE

FOR MAINTAINING EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL

REPORTING AND FOR ITS ASSESSMENT OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF

INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING. OUR RESPONSIBILITY IS

TO EXPRESS AN OPINION ON MANAGEMENTS ASSESSMENT AND AN

OPINION ON THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE COMPANYS INTERNAL

CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING BASED ON OUR AUDIT.

WE CONDUCTED OUR AUDIT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE STANDARDS OF THE

PUBLIC COMPANY ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BOARD (UNITED STATES). THOSE

STANDARDS REQUIRE THAT WE PLAN AND PERFORM THE AUDIT TO OBTAIN

REASONABLE ASSURANCE ABOUT WHETHER EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL

OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING WAS MAINTAINED IN ALL MATERIAL

RESPECTS. OUR AUDIT INCLUDED OBTAINING AN UNDERSTANDING OF

INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, EVALUATING

MANAGEMENTS ASSESSMENT, TESTING AND EVALUATING THE DESIGN

AND OPERATING EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL CONTROL, AND PERFORMING

SUCH OTHER PROCEDURES AS WE CONSIDERED NECESSARY IN THE

CIRCUMSTANCES. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR AUDIT PROVIDES A REASONABLE

BASIS FOR OUR OPINION.

A COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING IS A

PROCESS DESIGNED TO PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING THE

RELIABILITY OF FINANCIAL REPORTING AND THE PREPARATION OF

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR EXTERNAL PURPOSES IN ACCORDANCE WITH

GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES. A COMPANYS

INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING INCLUDES THOSE

POLICIES AND PROCEDURES THAT (1) PERTAIN TO THE MAINTENANCE OF

RECORDS THAT, IN REASONABLE DETAIL, ACCURATELY AND FAIRLY

REFLECT THE TRANSACTIONS AND DISPOSITIONS OF THE ASSETS OF THE

COMPANY; (2) PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE THAT TRANSACTIONS ARE

RECORDED AS NECESSARY TO PERMIT PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING

PRINCIPLES, AND THAT RECEIPTS AND EXPENDITURES OF THE COMPANY

ARE BEING MADE ONLY IN ACCORDANCE WITH AUTHORIZATIONS OF

MANAGEMENT AND DIRECTORS OF THE COMPANY; AND (3) PROVIDE

REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING PREVENTION OR TIMELY DETECTION OF

UNAUTHORIZED ACQUISITION, USE, OR DISPOSITION OF THE

COMPANYS ASSETS THAT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

BECAUSE OF ITS INHERENT LIMITATIONS, INTERNAL CONTROL OVER

FINANCIAL REPORTING MAY NOT PREVENT OR DETECT MISSTATEMENTS.

ALSO, PROJECTIONS OF ANY EVALUATION OF EFFECTIVENESS TO FUTURE

PERIODS ARE SUBJECT TO THE RISK THAT CONTROLS MAY BECOME

INADEQUATE BECAUSE OF CHANGES IN CONDITIONS, OR THAT THE DEGREE

OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE POLICIES OR PROCEDURES MAY DETERIORATE.

IN OUR OPINION, MANAGEMENTS ASSESSMENT THAT INTEL

CORPORATION MAINTAINED EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL

REPORTING AS OF DECEMBER 30, 2006, IS FAIRLY STATED, IN ALL

MATERIAL RESPECTS, BASED ON THE COSO CRITERIA. ALSO, IN OUR

OPINION, INTEL CORPORATION MAINTAINED, IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS,

EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF

DECEMBER 30, 2006, BASED ON THE COSO CRITERIA.

WE ALSO HAVE AUDITED, IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE STANDARDS OF THE

PUBLIC COMPANY ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BOARD (UNITED STATES), THE

2006 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF INTEL CORPORATION AND

OUR REPORT DATED FEBRUARY 20, 2007 EXPRESSED AN UNQUALIFIED

OPINION THEREON.

EVALUATION

OF DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

WE CONDUCTED AN EVALUATION OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE DESIGN

AND OPERATION OF OUR DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND

PROCEDURES (DISCLOSURE CONTROLS) AS OF THE END OF THE

PERIOD COVERED BY THIS FORM

10-K.

THE

CONTROLS EVALUATION WAS CONDUCTED UNDER THE SUPERVISION AND WITH

THE PARTICIPATION OF MANAGEMENT, INCLUDING OUR CEO AND CFO.

DISCLOSURE CONTROLS ARE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES DESIGNED TO

REASONABLY ASSURE THAT INFORMATION REQUIRED TO BE DISCLOSED IN

OUR REPORTS FILED UNDER THE EXCHANGE ACT, SUCH AS THIS FORM

10-K,

IS

RECORDED, PROCESSED, SUMMARIZED, AND REPORTED WITHIN THE TIME

PERIODS SPECIFIED IN THE SECS RULES AND FORMS. DISCLOSURE

CONTROLS ARE ALSO DESIGNED TO REASONABLY ASSURE THAT SUCH

INFORMATION IS ACCUMULATED AND COMMUNICATED TO OUR MANAGEMENT,

INCLUDING THE CEO AND CFO, AS APPROPRIATE TO ALLOW TIMELY

DECISIONS REGARDING REQUIRED DISCLOSURE. OUR QUARTERLY

EVALUATION OF DISCLOSURE CONTROLS INCLUDES AN EVALUATION OF SOME

COMPONENTS OF OUR INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, AND

INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING IS ALSO SEPARATELY

EVALUATED ON AN ANNUAL BASIS FOR PURPOSES OF PROVIDING THE

MANAGEMENT REPORT, WHICH IS SET FORTH BELOW.

THE EVALUATION OF OUR DISCLOSURE CONTROLS INCLUDED A REVIEW OF

THE CONTROLS OBJECTIVES AND DESIGN, THE COMPANYS

IMPLEMENTATION OF THE CONTROLS, AND THEIR EFFECT ON THE

INFORMATION GENERATED FOR USE IN THIS FORM

10-K.

IN THE

COURSE OF THE CONTROLS EVALUATION, WE REVIEWED IDENTIFIED DATA

ERRORS, CONTROL PROBLEMS, OR ACTS OF FRAUD, AND SOUGHT TO

CONFIRM THAT APPROPRIATE CORRECTIVE ACTIONS, INCLUDING PROCESS

IMPROVEMENTS, WERE BEING UNDERTAKEN. THIS TYPE OF EVALUATION IS

PERFORMED ON A QUARTERLY BASIS SO THAT THE CONCLUSIONS OF

MANAGEMENT, INCLUDING THE CEO AND CFO, CONCERNING THE

EFFECTIVENESS OF THE DISCLOSURE CONTROLS CAN BE REPORTED IN OUR

PERIODIC REPORTS ON FORM

10-Q

AND

FORM

10-K.

MANY OF THE COMPONENTS OF OUR DISCLOSURE CONTROLS ARE ALSO

EVALUATED ON AN ONGOING BASIS BY OUR INTERNAL AUDIT DEPARTMENT

AND BY OTHER PERSONNEL IN OUR FINANCE AND ENTERPRISE SERVICES

ORGANIZATION. THE OVERALL GOALS OF THESE VARIOUS EVALUATION

ACTIVITIES ARE TO MONITOR OUR DISCLOSURE CONTROLS, AND TO MODIFY

THEM AS NECESSARY. OUR INTENT IS TO MAINTAIN THE DISCLOSURE

CONTROLS AS DYNAMIC SYSTEMS THAT CHANGE AS CONDITIONS WARRANT.

BASED ON THE CONTROLS EVALUATION, OUR CEO AND CFO HAVE CONCLUDED

THAT, AS OF THE END OF THE PERIOD COVERED BY THIS FORM

10-K,

OUR

DISCLOSURE CONTROLS WERE EFFECTIVE TO PROVIDE REASONABLE

ASSURANCE THAT INFORMATION REQUIRED TO BE DISCLOSED IN OUR

EXCHANGE ACT REPORTS IS RECORDED, PROCESSED, SUMMARIZED, AND

REPORTED WITHIN THE TIME PERIODS SPECIFIED BY THE SEC, AND THAT

MATERIAL INFORMATION RELATED TO INTEL AND ITS CONSOLIDATED

SUBSIDIARIES IS MADE KNOWN TO MANAGEMENT, INCLUDING THE CEO AND

CFO, PARTICULARLY DURING THE PERIOD WHEN OUR PERIODIC REPORTS

ARE BEING PREPARED.

MANAGEMENT

REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

OUR MANAGEMENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ESTABLISHING AND MAINTAINING

ADEQUATE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING TO PROVIDE

REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING THE RELIABILITY OF OUR FINANCIAL

REPORTING AND THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR

EXTERNAL PURPOSES IN ACCORDANCE WITH U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED

ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES. INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

INCLUDES THOSE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES THAT (I) PERTAIN TO THE

MAINTENANCE OF RECORDS THAT IN REASONABLE DETAIL ACCURATELY AND

FAIRLY REFLECT THE TRANSACTIONS AND DISPOSITIONS OF THE ASSETS

OF THE COMPANY; (II) PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE THAT

TRANSACTIONS ARE RECORDED AS NECESSARY TO PERMIT PREPARATION OF

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED

ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES, AND THAT RECEIPTS AND EXPENDITURES OF THE

COMPANY ARE BEING MADE ONLY IN ACCORDANCE WITH AUTHORIZATIONS OF

MANAGEMENT AND DIRECTORS OF THE COMPANY; AND (III) PROVIDE

REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING PREVENTION OR TIMELY DETECTION OF

UNAUTHORIZED ACQUISITION, USE, OR DISPOSITION OF THE

COMPANYS ASSETS THAT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

MANAGEMENT ASSESSED OUR INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL

REPORTING AS OF DECEMBER 30, 2006, THE END OF OUR FISCAL YEAR.

MANAGEMENT BASED ITS ASSESSMENT ON CRITERIA ESTABLISHED IN

INTERNAL CONTROLINTEGRATED FRAMEWORK ISSUED BY THE

COMMITTEE OF SPONSORING ORGANIZATIONS OF THE TREADWAY

COMMISSION. MANAGEMENTS ASSESSMENT INCLUDED EVALUATION OF

ELEMENTS SUCH AS THE DESIGN AND OPERATING EFFECTIVENESS OF KEY

FINANCIAL REPORTING CONTROLS, PROCESS DOCUMENTATION, ACCOUNTING

POLICIES, AND OUR OVERALL CONTROL ENVIRONMENT. THIS ASSESSMENT

IS SUPPORTED BY TESTING AND MONITORING PERFORMED BY BOTH OUR

INTERNAL AUDIT ORGANIZATION AND OUR FINANCE AND ENTERPRISE

SERVICES ORGANIZATION.

BASED ON OUR ASSESSMENT, MANAGEMENT HAS CONCLUDED THAT OUR

INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING WAS EFFECTIVE AS OF

THE END OF THE FISCAL YEAR TO PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE

REGARDING THE RELIABILITY OF FINANCIAL REPORTING AND THE

PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR EXTERNAL REPORTING

PURPOSES IN ACCORDANCE WITH U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING

PRINCIPLES. WE REVIEWED THE RESULTS OF MANAGEMENTS

ASSESSMENT WITH THE AUDIT COMMITTEE OF OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS.

IN ADDITION, ON A QUARTERLY BASIS WE EVALUATE ANY CHANGES TO OUR

INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING TO DETERMINE IF

MATERIAL CHANGES OCCURRED.

OUR INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM, ERNST &

YOUNG LLP, AUDITED MANAGEMENTS ASSESSMENT AND

INDEPENDENTLY ASSESSED THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE COMPANYS

INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING. ERNST & YOUNG HAS

ISSUED AN ATTESTATION REPORT CONCURRING WITH MANAGEMENTS

ASSESSMENT, WHICH IS INCLUDED AT THE END OF PART II, ITEM 8 OF

THIS FORM

10-K.

INHERENT

LIMITATIONS ON EFFECTIVENESS OF CONTROLS

THE COMPANYS MANAGEMENT, INCLUDING THE CEO AND CFO, DOES

NOT EXPECT THAT OUR DISCLOSURE CONTROLS OR OUR INTERNAL CONTROL

OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING WILL PREVENT OR DETECT ALL ERROR AND

ALL FRAUD. A CONTROL SYSTEM, NO MATTER HOW WELL DESIGNED AND

OPERATED, CAN PROVIDE ONLY REASONABLE, NOT ABSOLUTE, ASSURANCE

THAT THE CONTROL SYSTEMS OBJECTIVES WILL BE MET. THE

DESIGN OF A CONTROL SYSTEM MUST REFLECT THE FACT THAT THERE ARE

RESOURCE CONSTRAINTS, AND THE BENEFITS OF CONTROLS MUST BE

CONSIDERED RELATIVE TO THEIR COSTS. FURTHER, BECAUSE OF THE

INHERENT LIMITATIONS IN ALL CONTROL SYSTEMS, NO EVALUATION OF

CONTROLS CAN PROVIDE ABSOLUTE ASSURANCE THAT MISSTATEMENTS DUE

TO ERROR OR FRAUD WILL NOT OCCUR OR THAT ALL CONTROL ISSUES AND

INSTANCES OF FRAUD, IF ANY, WITHIN THE COMPANY HAVE BEEN

DETECTED. THESE INHERENT LIMITATIONS INCLUDE THE REALITIES THAT

JUDGMENTS IN DECISION-MAKING CAN BE FAULTY AND THAT BREAKDOWNS

CAN OCCUR BECAUSE OF SIMPLE ERROR OR MISTAKE. CONTROLS CAN ALSO

BE CIRCUMVENTED BY THE INDIVIDUAL ACTS OF SOME PERSONS, BY

COLLUSION OF TWO OR MORE PEOPLE, OR BY MANAGEMENT OVERRIDE OF

THE CONTROLS. THE DESIGN OF ANY SYSTEM OF CONTROLS IS BASED IN

PART ON CERTAIN ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT THE LIKELIHOOD OF FUTURE

EVENTS, AND THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT ANY DESIGN WILL

SUCCEED IN ACHIEVING ITS STATED GOALS UNDER ALL POTENTIAL FUTURE

CONDITIONS. PROJECTIONS OF ANY EVALUATION OF CONTROLS

EFFECTIVENESS TO FUTURE PERIODS ARE SUBJECT TO RISKS. OVER TIME,

CONTROLS MAY BECOME INADEQUATE BECAUSE OF CHANGES IN CONDITIONS

OR DETERIORATION IN THE DEGREE OF COMPLIANCE WITH POLICIES OR

PROCEDURES.
