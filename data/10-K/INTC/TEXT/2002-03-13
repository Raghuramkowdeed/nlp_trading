MICROPROCESSORS.

A MICROPROCESSOR IS THE CENTRAL PROCESSING UNIT (CPU) OF A COMPUTER SYSTEM. IT

PROCESSES SYSTEM DATA AND CONTROLS OTHER DEVICES IN THE SYSTEM, ACTING AS THE BRAINS OF THE COMPUTER. ONE INDICATOR OF MICROPROCESSOR PERFORMANCE IS ITS CLOCK SPEED, THE RATE AT WHICH ITS INTERNAL

LOGIC OPERATES, WHICH IS MEASURED IN UNITS OF HERTZ, OR CYCLES PROCESSED PER SECOND. ONE MEGAHERTZ (MHZ) EQUALS ONE MILLION CYCLES PROCESSED PER SECOND, AND ONE GIGAHERTZ (GHZ) EQUALS ONE BILLION

CYCLES PROCESSED PER SECOND. OTHER FACTORS IN CHIP PERFORMANCE INCLUDE MEMORY STORAGE AND ACCESS SPEED. THE MEMORY STORED ON A CHIP IS MEASURED IN BYTES, WITH 1,024 BYTES EQUALING A KILOBYTE (KB),

1.049 MILLION BYTES EQUALING A MEGABYTE (MB) AND 1.074 BILLION BYTES EQUALING A GIGABYTE (GB). CACHE IS A MEMORY SUBSYSTEM IN WHICH FREQUENTLY USED DATA IS DUPLICATED FOR QUICK ACCESS. A

SECOND LEVEL OF

2

CACHE (L2), LOCATED DIRECTLY ON THE MICROPROCESSOR, CAN ALSO BE USED TO FURTHER INCREASE SYSTEM PERFORMANCE.

IN

2001, WE BEGAN CONVERTING OUR MICROPROCESSOR MANUFACTURING FROM THE 0.18-MICRON PROCESS TECHNOLOGY TO THE 0.13-MICRON PROCESS TECHNOLOGY. THE WIDTH OF

INDIVIDUAL TRANSISTORS ON A CHIP IS MEASURED IN MICRONS; ONE MICRON EQUALS ONE MILLIONTH OF A METER. SEE THE DISCUSSION OF MANUFACTURING PROCESS TECHNOLOGIES UNDER THE HEADING "MANUFACTURING, ASSEMBLY

AND TEST" IN PART I, ITEM 1 OF THIS FORM 10-K.

MOVING ACROSS THE INTERNET AND CORPORATE NETWORKS. IN 2001, WE INTRODUCED NEW MEMBERS OF THE INTEL® IXP1200 NETWORK PROCESSOR FAMILY, WHICH HAS ALREADY BEEN CHOSEN BY OUR CUSTOMERS FOR

USE IN MORE THAN 175 APPLICATION DESIGNS.

IN

MARCH 2001, WE INTRODUCED A LOW POWER 700-MHZ VERSION OF THE INTEL PENTIUM III PROCESSOR, AIMED AT APPLIED COMPUTING COMMUNICATIONS APPLICATIONS IN WHICH HEAT AND

CONSTRAINED SPACE ARE FACTORS. IN DECEMBER 2001, WE INTRODUCED THE FIRST IN A LINE OF COMMUNICATIONS CHIPS SPECIFICALLY DESIGNED FOR THE EMBEDDED INDUSTRY. THE INTEL® 82801E

COMMUNICATIONS I/O CONTROLLER HUB (C-ICH) INTEGRATES MULTIPLE COMMUNICATIONS PORTS, ELIMINATING THE NEED FOR SEPARATE NETWORKING CHIPS THAT WOULD OTHERWISE BE REQUIRED.

IN

APRIL 2001, WE ACQUIRED VXTEL INC., A SEMICONDUCTOR COMPANY THAT HAS DEVELOPED VOICE OVER PACKET (VOP) PRODUCTS THAT DELIVER HIGH-QUALITY VOICE AND DATA

COMMUNICATIONS OVER NEXT-GENERATION OPTICAL NETWORKS. IN JUNE 2001, WE INTRODUCED A SUITE OF COMMUNICATIONS PRODUCTS, INCLUDING SILICON COMPONENTS, SOFTWARE AND REFERENCE DESIGNS

FOR BUILDING THE SYSTEMS USED TO TRANSMIT VOICE COMMUNICATIONS OVER THE INTERNET. VOP IS A CRITICAL TECHNOLOGY FOR ENABLING THE TRANSITION FROM CIRCUIT-SWITCHED NETWORKS, SUCH AS TRADITIONAL TELEPHONE

AND WIRELESS NETWORKS, TO PACKET-BASED NETWORKS, SUCH AS THE INTERNET. WE EXPECT THAT OUR VOP TECHNOLOGY WILL ALLOW TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICE PROVIDERS TO OFFER MORE SERVICES, SUCH AS VOICE, FAX AND

DATA APPLICATIONS, AT HIGHER DENSITY AND LOWER COST THAN CURRENT SERVICES.

IN

FEBRUARY 2002, WE UNVEILED A FAMILY OF NETWORK PROCESSORS BASED ON THE ADVANCED INTEL XSCALE TECHNOLOGY. THE NEW INTEL XSCALE TECHNOLOGY-BASED PRODUCTS INCLUDE THE INDUSTRY'S

BROADEST LINE OF NETWORK PROCESSORS, WHICH ARE UP TO 16 TIMES FASTER THAN OUR PREVIOUS OFFERINGS. THE NETWORK PROCESSORS ARE DESIGNED FOR APPLICATIONS EXTENDING FROM THE HOME AND OFFICE TO SERVICE

PROVIDERS' CENTRAL SWITCHING OFFICE AND INCLUDE THE INTEL® IXP2800 NETWORK PROCESSOR FOR NETWORK CORE APPLICATIONS, SUCH AS ULTRAHIGH-SPEED SWITCH/ROUTERS; THE INTEL® IXP2400

NETWORK PROCESSOR FOR MULTI-SERVICE SWITCHES AND SIMILAR EQUIPMENT AT THE NETWORK EDGE; AND THE INTEL® IXP425 NETWORK PROCESSOR FOR EQUIPMENT THAT BRINGS DIGITAL SUBSCRIBER LINE (DSL),

CABLE INTERNET SERVICE AND WIRELESS NETWORKING TO HOMES AND OFFICES.

INCLUDING LASER PRINTERS, IMAGING PRODUCTS, STORAGE MEDIA, POINT-OF-SALE SYSTEMS, INDUSTRIAL AUTOMATION EQUIPMENT, AND AUTOMOTIVE SYSTEMS. PRODUCT FAMILIES INCLUDE THE

INTEL®186, INTE1386 PROCESSOR AND INTE1486 PROCESSOR, THE I960® PROCESSOR AND 8-BIT AND 16-BIT MICROCONTROLLERS.

WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS AND COMPUTING GROUP

THE WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS AND COMPUTING GROUP PROVIDES COMPONENT-LEVEL HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE FOR DIGITAL CELLULAR COMMUNICATIONS AND OTHER APPLICATIONS

REQUIRING BOTH LOW-POWER PROCESSING AND HIGH PERFORMANCE. OUR STRATEGY IS TO DELIVER COMPLETE SOLUTIONS THAT ENABLE QUICK DEPLOYMENT OF APPLICATIONS AND SERVICES FOR WIRELESS INTERNET AND

HANDHELD COMPUTING DEVICES. OUR CURRENT PRODUCTS FOR THE HANDHELD PLATFORM INCLUDE FLASH MEMORY, PROCESSORS BASED ON THE INTEL® STRONGARM* PROCESSOR AND INTEL XSCALE MICROARCHITECTURE, AND

CELLULAR BASEBAND CHIPSETS.

IN

THE MARKET SEGMENT FOR HANDHELD COMPUTING DEVICES, WE SELL FLASH MEMORY, BASEBAND CHIPSETS AND PROCESSORS TO OEMS OF CELLULAR HANDSETS AND WE SELL FLASH MEMORY AND PROCESSORS

TO OEMS OF PERSONAL DIGITAL ASSISTANTS (PDAS). GROWTH IN THIS MARKET SEGMENT IS DEPENDENT ON THE INCREASED USE OF FEATURE-RICH HANDSETS AND DATA-INTENSIVE APPLICATIONS. GROWTH

FOR FLASH MEMORY PRODUCTS WILL ALSO DEPEND ON THE ATTRACTIVENESS OF THE LATEST FEATURES OF CELLULAR HANDSET PRODUCTS, INCLUDING 2.5G MOBILE WIRELESS DEVICES. THESE 2.5G DEVICES ARE BASED ON THE

WIRELESS TECHNOLOGY USUALLY ASSOCIATED WITH DATA TRANSFER RATES FASTER THAN 14.4 THOUSAND INDIVIDUAL BITS OF INFORMATION PER SECOND (KBPS, OR KILOBITS PER SECOND), BUT SLOWER THAN

384 KBPS. OUR STRATEGY IS IN PART DEPENDENT ON THE WILLINGNESS OF CURRENT OWNERS OF HANDSET PRODUCTS TO UPGRADE TO THE LATEST VERSIONS OF THESE DEVICES.

8

AT

THE HEART OF OUR WIRELESS PRODUCT STRATEGY IS THE INTEL® PERSONAL INTERNET CLIENT ARCHITECTURE (INTEL® PCA), AN OPEN ARCHITECTURE PLATFORM THAT DESCRIBES THE

SEPARATION OF COMMUNICATION AND APPLICATION BUILDING BLOCKS FOR DATA-ENABLED CELLULAR PHONES AND PORTABLE HANDHELD DEVICES. BY SEPARATING THE COMMUNICATION AND APPLICATION ELEMENTS WITHIN

A DEVICE, INTEL PCA SHOULD ALLOW FOR FASTER TIME-TO-MARKET FOR OUR CUSTOMERS AND A STANDARD, SCALABLE PLATFORM FOR APPLICATION DEVELOPMENT. IN AUGUST 2001, WE LAUNCHED

THE INTEL® PERSONAL INTERNET CLIENT ARCHITECTURE DEVELOPER NETWORK WHICH FEATURES MORE THAN 400 HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE DESIGN TOOLS AND APPLICATIONS, AND IS AVAILABLE TO HELP DELIVER

STANDARDS-BASED SOFTWARE AND HARDWARE SOLUTIONS. BY THE END OF 2001, MORE THAN 800 COMPANIES WERE MEMBERS OF THE NETWORK.

NET

REVENUES FOR THE WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS AND COMPUTING GROUP OPERATING SEGMENT COMPRISED APPROXIMATELY 8% OF OUR CONSOLIDATED NET REVENUES FOR 2001.

FLASH MEMORY.

FLASH MEMORY IS A SPECIALIZED TYPE OF MEMORY COMPONENT USED TO STORE USER DATA AND

PROGRAM CODE; IT RETAINS THIS INFORMATION EVEN WHEN THE POWER IS OFF. ALTHOUGH FLASH MEMORY IS CURRENTLY USED PREDOMINANTLY IN MOBILE PHONES AND PDAS, IT IS ALSO FOUND IN COMMON CONSUMER PRODUCTS,

INCLUDING MP3 MUSIC PLAYERS, HANDHELD VOICE RECORDERS AND DIGITAL ANSWERING MACHINES, AS WELL AS INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTS.

OUR

INTEL® STRATAFLASH® MEMORY TECHNOLOGY PROVIDES A COST-EFFECTIVE, SINGLE-CHIP SOLUTION FOR CODE EXECUTION AND DATA STORAGE. IN

SEPTEMBER 2001, WE INTRODUCED A 3-VOLT SYNCHRONOUS INTEL STRATAFLASH MEMORY, WHICH OPERATES UP TO FOUR TIMES FASTER THAN TRADITIONAL FLASH MEMORY. IN OCTOBER 2001, WE

PRODUCED THE INDUSTRY'S FIRST FLASH MEMORY BUILT ON THE 0.13-MICRON MANUFACTURING PROCESS TECHNOLOGY AND PLAN TO BEGINNING SHIPPING THESE COMPONENTS TO CUSTOMERS IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF

2002. THIS NEW FLASH CHIP IS NEARLY 50% SMALLER AND CONSUMES LESS POWER THAN ITS 0.18-MICRON PREDECESSOR, MAKING IT IDEAL FOR CELL PHONES AND OTHER ELECTRONICS EQUIPMENT FOR WHICH SMALL

FORM FACTOR AND LOW POWER CONSUMPTION ARE CRITICAL. BY THE END OF 2001, OUR CUSTOMERS HAD CHOSEN INTEL STRATAFLASH MEMORY FOR USE IN MORE THAN 1,200 APPLICATION DESIGNS, IN PRODUCTS SUCH AS CELL

PHONES, PDAS AND SET-TOP BOXES.

PROCESSORS FOR HANDHELD COMPUTING DEVICES.

BUILDING ON INTEL STRONGARM TECHNOLOGY, WHICH WE LICENSE

FROM ARM, LTD., INTEL XSCALE MICROARCHITECTURE OFFERS LOW-POWER CONSUMPTION (CONSUMING AS LITTLE AS 1/10,000 OF A WATT) AND FAST CLOCK SPEEDS AND ENABLES A NEW GENERATION OF

HANDHELD AND CELLULAR DEVICES SUCH AS THOSE BASED ON THE MICROSOFT POCKET PC 2002* OPERATING SYSTEM. FUTURE MICROPROCESSORS BASED ON THE INTEL XSCALE TECHNOLOGY WILL BE DESIGNED TO SCALE BETWEEN HIGH

PERFORMANCE AND LOWER POWER CONSUMPTION. IN OCTOBER 2001, WE ANNOUNCED THAT SIX MAJOR MANUFACTURERS OF PDAS HAD SELECTED THE INTEL STRONGARM SA-1110 PROCESSOR TO POWER THEIR NEXT

GENERATION OF HANDHELD COMMUNICATIONS DEVICES. THE INTEL SA-1110 PROCESSOR TYPICALLY USES LESS THAN ONE HALF WATT OF POWER, GREATLY EXTENDING BATTERY LIFE FOR HANDHELD DEVICES WHILE

PROVIDING POWERFUL PERFORMANCE FOR A VARIETY OF BUSINESS, MULTIMEDIA AND INTERNET APPLICATIONS.

IN

FEBRUARY 2002, WE INTRODUCED THE INTEL® PXA250 AND PXA210 CHIPS, WHICH WILL ENABLE MOBILE PHONES AND HANDHELD COMPUTERS TO DELIVER MUSIC, VIDEO AND GAMES, AS WELL

AS THE LATEST ENTERPRISE APPLICATIONS UNDER DEVELOPMENT. ALSO IN FEBRUARY 2002, INTEL AND MICROSOFT ANNOUNCED AN OUTLINE OF THE DETAILS OF THEIR COLLABORATION TO OPTIMIZE MICROSOFT WINDOWS

CE.NET* FOR INTEL PXA250 AND INTEL PXA210 APPLICATIONS PROCESSORS BASED ON THE INTEL XSCALE MICROARCHITECTURE IN SUPPORT OF THE INTEL PCA. THE EFFORT WILL ENABLE HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE DEVELOPERS TO

CREATE POWERFUL, CONNECTED MOBILE DEVICES THAT UTILIZE THE LATEST BROWSING, MULTIMEDIA AND WIRELESS CAPABILITIES WHILE MAXIMIZING BATTERY LIFE.

CELLULAR BASEBAND CHIPSETS.

WE OFFER BASEBAND CHIPSETS FOR DESIGNING MULTI-MODE,

MULTI-BAND WIRELESS HANDSETS. BASED ON DSP TECHNOLOGY, OUR CHIPSETS SUPPORT MULTIPLE WIRELESS STANDARDS AND DELIVER ENHANCED VOICE QUALITY AND HIGH INTEGRATION, WHILE REDUCING POWER

OFFER THE INTEL® D5205 TDMA BASEBAND CHIPSET, A COMPACT TWO-CHIP SOLUTION, AND THE INTEL® 5206 TDMA BASEBAND CHIP, A COMPACT SINGLE-CHIP SOLUTION BOTH

FOR DUAL-MODE CELLULAR AND PERSONAL COMMUNICATION SERVICES (PCS) BAND APPLICATIONS. WE ALSO OFFER THE INTEL® D5314 PDC BASEBAND CHIP, A COMPACT SINGLE-CHIP SOLUTION

FOR DUAL RATE (FULL AND HALF RATE) BASEBAND PROCESSING FOR PERSONAL DIGITAL CELLULAR HANDHELD PHONES.

NEW BUSINESS GROUP

THE NEW BUSINESS GROUP OPERATING SEGMENT IS CHARTERED TO DEVELOP AND GROW NEW BUSINESSES AROUND OUR CORE CAPABILITIES. THE GROUP'S CURRENT INVESTMENTS INCLUDE WEB

HOSTING SERVICES, SOFTWARE AND SEMICONDUCTOR PRODUCTS.

IN

2001, INTEL ONLINE SERVICES, INC. OPERATED EIGHT DATA CENTERS OFFERING WEB HOSTING AND DATA CENTER SERVICES IN THE UNITED STATES, EUROPE, INDIA, JAPAN, CHINA, KOREA AND

AUSTRALIA.

IN

2001, WE MADE THE DECISION TO EXIT THE CONSUMER PRODUCTS MARKETPLACE AND CONSEQUENTLY BEGAN TO PHASE OUT OUR CONSUMER PRODUCT DIVISION, WHICH PROVIDED PC ACCESSORIES SUCH AS THE

INTEL® POCKET PC CAMERA, THE INTEL® PERSONAL AUDIO PLAYER 3000 AND THE INTEL® PLAY MOVIE CREATOR. WE DO NOT EXPECT THE PHASE-OUT OF THIS

BUSINESS TO HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON INTEL'S SALES OR GROSS MARGIN.

MANUFACTURING, ASSEMBLY AND TEST

THE MAJORITY OF OUR WAFER MANUFACTURING, INCLUDING MICROPROCESSOR, FLASH MEMORY AND NETWORKING SILICON FABRICATION, IS CONDUCTED WITHIN THE UNITED STATES AT OUR

FACILITIES IN NEW MEXICO, ARIZONA, OREGON, COLORADO, CALIFORNIA AND MASSACHUSETTS. A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR WAFER MANUFACTURING, PRIMARILY MICROPROCESSOR AND CHIPSET FABRICATION, IS CONDUCTED

OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES AT FACILITIES IN ISRAEL AND IRELAND. AS OF YEAR-END 2001, THE ISRAEL AND IRELAND FACILITIES ACCOUNTED FOR APPROXIMATELY 30% OF OUR TOTAL WAFER FABRICATION.

AS

OF YEAR-END 2001, A SUBSTANTIAL MAJORITY OF OUR MICROPROCESSORS AND CHIPSETS WERE MANUFACTURED USING OUR 0.18-MICRON PROCESS TECHNOLOGY IN ARIZONA, NEW MEXICO,

ISRAEL, AND IRELAND. DURING THE YEAR, WE RAMPED OUR 0.13-MICRON MANUFACTURING PROCESS ON 200MM (8-INCH) WAFERS AT THREE EXISTING FACILITIES IN OREGON, CALIFORNIA AND

MASSACHUSETTS, AS WELL AS A NEWLY CONSTRUCTED FACILITY IN ARIZONA. THESE FACTORIES PRODUCE OUR MOST ADVANCED MICROPROCESSORS, INCLUDING THE LATEST PENTIUM 4 PROCESSORS. THE 0.13-MICRON

PROCESS TECHNOLOGY FEATURES STRUCTURES SMALLER THAN 1/1,000TH THE THICKNESS OF A HUMAN HAIR (0.18 MICRON IS 1/500TH THE THICKNESS OF A HUMAN HAIR).

IN

DECEMBER 2001, WE BEGAN MANUFACTURING 0.13-MICRON MICROPROCESSORS IN OREGON ON 300MM (12-INCH) WAFERS AND IN FEBRUARY 2002 BEGAN SHIPPING

PRODUCTS TO CUSTOMERS. A SECOND 300MM WAFER FACILITY IS SCHEDULED TO COME ON LINE IN NEW MEXICO IN THE SECOND HALF OF 2002. WE EXPECT THE LARGER 300MM WAFER SIZE TO CUT DIE MANUFACTURING COSTS BY

APPROXIMATELY 30% WHEN FULLY IMPLEMENTED.

DURING

THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2001, WE COMPLETED RETROFITTING CHANGES, PROCESS IMPROVEMENTS, AND EQUIPMENT INSTALLATIONS AND BEGAN MANUFACTURING FLASH MEMORY USING OUR

0.18-MICRON PROCESS

TECHNOLOGY AT A COLORADO FACILITY THAT WE ACQUIRED IN 2000. IN ADDITION TO THIS COLORADO SITE, WE ALSO MANUFACTURE FLASH MEMORY IN OREGON, NEW MEXICO AND CALIFORNIA USING OUR 0.18-MICRON

PROCESS TECHNOLOGY.

WE

PERFORM A SUBSTANTIAL MAJORITY OF OUR COMPONENTS ASSEMBLY AND TESTING, INCLUDING ASSEMBLY AND TESTING FOR MICROPROCESSORS, AT FACILITIES IN MALAYSIA, THE PHILIPPINES AND COSTA RICA.

WE ALSO PERFORM COMPONENTS ASSEMBLY AND TESTING FOR CHIPSETS AND FLASH MEMORY AT A FACILITY IN CHINA. DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2001, WE ANNOUNCED AN ADDITIONAL INVESTMENT IN THE ASSEMBLY AND TEST

FACILITY IN CHINA, AND WE WILL USE THIS LATEST INVESTMENT TO VALIDATE, TEST AND ASSEMBLE THE INTEL 845 CHIPSET FOR THE PENTIUM 4 PROCESSOR PLATFORM. WITH THE EXPANSION, WE HAVE QUADRUPLED THE

FACILITY'S SIZE AND ENHANCED THE FLASH MEMORY CHIP ASSEMBLY AND TEST CAPABILITIES.

10

WE ALSO MANUFACTURE MICROPROCESSOR- AND NETWORKING-RELATED BOARD-LEVEL PRODUCTS AND SYSTEMS AT FACILITIES IN MALAYSIA, WASHINGTON AND CALIFORNIA. DURING THE FIRST HALF OF 2001, WE PHASED

OUT OUR BOARD MANUFACTURING OPERATIONS IN PUERTO RICO FOR COST COMPETITIVE REASONS.

TO

AUGMENT CAPACITY IN THE UNITED STATES AS WELL AS INTERNATIONALLY, WE USE SUBCONTRACTORS TO PERFORM ASSEMBLY OF CERTAIN PRODUCTS, PRIMARILY FLASH MEMORY, CHIPSETS AND NETWORKING AND

COMMUNICATIONS PRODUCTS, AS WELL AS FOUNDRY SERVICES TO MANUFACTURE WAFERS FOR CERTAIN COMPONENTS, INCLUDING NETWORKING AND COMMUNICATIONS PRODUCTS. WE ALSO USE SUBCONTRACTORS TO MANUFACTURE SOME

BOARD-LEVEL PRODUCTS AND SYSTEMS, AND WE PURCHASE CERTAIN COMMUNICATION NETWORKING PRODUCTS AND PC PERIPHERALS FROM EXTERNAL VENDORS, PRIMARILY IN THE ASIA-PACIFIC REGION.

WE

HAVE THOUSANDS OF SUPPLIERS PROVIDING OUR VARIOUS MATERIAL AND SERVICE NEEDS. WE SEEK, WHERE POSSIBLE, TO HAVE SEVERAL SOURCES OF SUPPLY FOR EVERYTHING, BUT ON LIMITED OCCASIONS WE

MAY RELY ON A SINGLE OR LIMITED NUMBER OF SUPPLIERS. IN THOSE CASES, WE DEVELOP AND IMPLEMENT PLANS AND ACTIONS TO MINIMIZE THE EXPOSURE THAT WOULD RESULT FROM A DISRUPTION AT THAT SUPPLIER. WE ALSO

TYPICALLY HAVE MULTIPLE FACTORIES AT MULTIPLE SITES AROUND THE WORLD PRODUCING OUR LEADING AND HIGHEST MARGIN PRODUCTS. HOWEVER, SOME OTHER PRODUCTS ARE ONLY PRODUCED IN ONE FACTORY, AND AGAIN WE

SEEK, THROUGH OTHER ACTIONS AND PLANS, TO MINIMIZE THE EXPOSURE THAT WOULD RESULT FROM A DISRUPTION AT THAT FACTORY.

MANUFACTURING

OF INTEGRATED CIRCUITS IS A COMPLEX PROCESS. NORMAL MANUFACTURING RISKS INCLUDE ERRORS AND INTERRUPTIONS IN THE PRODUCTION PROCESS, DEFECTS IN RAW MATERIALS AND DISRUPTIONS

AT SUPPLIERS, AS WELL AS OTHER RISKS, ALL OF WHICH CAN AFFECT YIELDS. A SUBSTANTIAL DECREASE IN YIELDS WOULD RESULT IN HIGHER MANUFACTURING COSTS AND THE POSSIBILITY OF NOT BEING ABLE TO PRODUCE

SUFFICIENT VOLUME TO MEET SPECIFIC PRODUCT DEMAND.

IN

GENERAL, IF WE WERE UNABLE TO MANUFACTURE WAFERS OR TO ASSEMBLE AND TEST OUR PRODUCTS ABROAD, OR IF AIR TRANSPORTATION BETWEEN OUR FOREIGN FACILITIES AND THE UNITED STATES WERE

DISRUPTED, THERE COULD BE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR OPERATIONS. IN ADDITION TO NORMAL RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH MANUFACTURING, ASSEMBLY AND TEST, OUR OPERATIONS OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES ARE

SUBJECT TO CERTAIN ADDITIONAL EXPOSURES. THESE RISKS INCLUDE CURRENCY CONTROLS AND FLUCTUATIONS; TARIFF, IMPORT AND OTHER RELATED RESTRICTIONS AND REGULATIONS; POSSIBLE DISRUPTION IN COMMERCIAL

ACTIVITIES RELATED TO TERRORIST ACTIVITY AND ARMED CONFLICT IN THE UNITED STATES, ISRAEL AND OTHER LOCATIONS; AND CIVIL OR MILITARY UNREST OR POLITICAL INSTABILITY IN A LOCALE. TO DATE, WE HAVE NOT

EXPERIENCED SIGNIFICANT DIFFICULTIES RELATED TO THESE FOREIGN BUSINESS RISKS.

FOLLOWING

THE ATTACKS ON THE WORLD TRADE CENTER IN NEW YORK CITY, PROPERTY INSURANCE UNDERWRITERS DELETED TERRORISM COVERAGE FROM THEIR POLICIES. WE ARE EXPLORING SPECIALTY MARKETS THAT

OFFER THIS COVERAGE, HOWEVER, THE COST MAY BE PROHIBITIVE. IN ADDITION, OUR PROPERTY INSURANCE COVERAGE LEVELS HAVE DECREASED AND OUR RETAINED RISK EXPOSURE FROM UNINSURED LOSSES HAS INCREASED. WE

HAVE NOT MADE ANY MATERIAL CHANGE TO OUR OPERATIONS AS A RESULT OF THE REDUCED COVERAGE. AVAILABILITY AND COST OF COVERAGE HAVE HISTORICALLY CHANGED AS THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY REACTED TO VARIOUS MARKET

FORCES AND WE WILL CONSIDER PURCHASING ADDITIONAL COVERAGE IF AND WHEN THE AVAILABILITY AND PRICING BECOME MORE FAVORABLE.

FOR

INFORMATION REGARDING ENVIRONMENTAL PROCEEDINGS RELATED TO CERTAIN FACILITIES, SEE THE INFORMATION UNDER THE HEADING "LEGAL PROCEEDINGS" IN PART I, ITEM 3 OF THIS

FORM 10-K.

EMPLOYEES

AS OF DECEMBER 29, 2001, WE EMPLOYED APPROXIMATELY 83,400 PEOPLE WORLDWIDE.

SALES

MOST OF OUR PRODUCTS ARE SOLD OR LICENSED THROUGH SALES OFFICES LOCATED NEAR MAJOR CONCENTRATIONS OF USERS THROUGHOUT NORTH AMERICA, EUROPE,

ASIA-PACIFIC, JAPAN AND OTHER PARTS OF THE WORLD.

11

WE

ALSO USE INDUSTRIAL AND RETAIL DISTRIBUTORS AND REPRESENTATIVES TO DISTRIBUTE OUR PRODUCTS WORLDWIDE. TYPICALLY, DISTRIBUTORS HANDLE A WIDE VARIETY OF PRODUCTS, INCLUDING THOSE THAT

COMPETE WITH OUR PRODUCTS, AND FILL ORDERS FOR MANY CUSTOMERS. MOST OF OUR SALES TO DISTRIBUTORS ARE MADE UNDER AGREEMENTS ALLOWING FOR PRICE PROTECTION ON UNSOLD MERCHANDISE AND RIGHT OF RETURN ON

STIPULATED QUANTITIES OF UNSOLD MERCHANDISE. SALES REPRESENTATIVES GENERALLY DO NOT OFFER DIRECTLY COMPETITIVE PRODUCTS BUT MAY CARRY COMPLEMENTARY ITEMS MANUFACTURED BY OTHERS. REPRESENTATIVES DO NOT

MAINTAIN A PRODUCT INVENTORY; INSTEAD, THEIR CUSTOMERS PLACE ORDERS DIRECTLY WITH US OR THROUGH DISTRIBUTORS. WE CONDUCTED BUSINESS WITH MORE THAN 2,000 CUSTOMERS WORLDWIDE IN 2001, INCLUDING

CUSTOMERS OF OUR ACQUIRED COMPANIES, AND SALES TO ONE CUSTOMER, DELL COMPUTER CORPORATION, CONTRIBUTED APPROXIMATELY 14% TO OUR TOTAL SALES IN 2001. A SUBSTANTIAL MAJORITY OF THE SALES TO THIS

CUSTOMER CONSISTED OF INTEL ARCHITECTURE PRODUCTS. NO OTHER CUSTOMER ACCOUNTED FOR MORE THAN 10% OF OUR TOTAL REVENUES. SALES TO OUR FIVE LARGEST CUSTOMERS ACCOUNTED FOR APPROXIMATELY 38% OF TOTAL

REVENUES. THE INFORMATION REGARDING REVENUES AND OPERATING PROFIT BY REPORTABLE SEGMENTS AND REVENUES FROM UNAFFILIATED CUSTOMERS BY GEOGRAPHIC REGION UNDER THE HEADING "OPERATING SEGMENT AND

GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION" ON PAGES 35 AND 36 OF OUR 2001 ANNUAL REPORT TO STOCKHOLDERS, IS INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE.

BACKLOG

OUR SALES ARE MADE PRIMARILY PURSUANT TO STANDARD PURCHASE ORDERS FOR DELIVERY OF STANDARD PRODUCTS. WE HAVE SOME AGREEMENTS THAT GIVE A CUSTOMER THE RIGHT TO

PURCHASE A SPECIFIC NUMBER OF PRODUCTS DURING A SPECIFIED TIME PERIOD. ALTHOUGH NOT GENERALLY OBLIGATING THE CUSTOMER TO PURCHASE ANY PARTICULAR NUMBER OF SUCH PRODUCTS, SOME OF THESE AGREEMENTS DO

CONTAIN BILLBACK CLAUSES. UNDER THESE CLAUSES, CUSTOMERS WHO DO NOT PURCHASE THE FULL VOLUME AGREED TO ARE LIABLE FOR BILLBACK ON PREVIOUS SHIPMENTS UP TO THE PRICE APPROPRIATE FOR THE QUANTITY

ACTUALLY PURCHASED. AS A MATTER OF INDUSTRY PRACTICE, BILLBACK CLAUSES ARE DIFFICULT TO ENFORCE. THE QUANTITY ACTUALLY PURCHASED BY THE CUSTOMER, AS WELL AS THE SHIPMENT SCHEDULES, ARE FREQUENTLY

REVISED DURING THE AGREEMENT TERM TO REFLECT CHANGES IN THE CUSTOMER'S NEEDS. IN LIGHT OF INDUSTRY PRACTICE AND EXPERIENCE, WE DO NOT BELIEVE THAT SUCH AGREEMENTS ARE MEANINGFUL FOR DETERMINING

BACKLOG AMOUNTS. WE BELIEVE THAT ONLY A SMALL PORTION OF OUR ORDER BACKLOG IS NONCANCELLABLE AND THAT THE DOLLAR AMOUNT ASSOCIATED WITH THE NONCANCELLABLE PORTION IS NOT MATERIAL. THEREFORE, WE DO NOT

BELIEVE THAT BACKLOG AS OF ANY PARTICULAR DATE IS INDICATIVE OF FUTURE RESULTS.

COMPETITION

OUR GOAL IS TO BE THE PREEMINENT BUILDING BLOCK SUPPLIER TO THE WORLDWIDE INTERNET ECONOMY. OUR PRIMARY FOCUS AREAS ARE THE DESKTOP, MOBILE AND SERVER PLATFORMS,

AND NETWORKING AND COMMUNICATIONS PLATFORM INCLUDING WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS, AS WELL AS NEW BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES AROUND THE INTERNET. IN EACH OF THESE MARKET SEGMENTS, WE COMPETE, TO VARIOUS

DEGREES, ON THE BASIS OF FUNCTIONALITY, PERFORMANCE, QUALITY, PRICE AND AVAILABILITY. WE ARE ENGAGED IN A RAPIDLY ADVANCING FIELD OF TECHNOLOGY IN WHICH OUR ABILITY TO COMPETE DEPENDS ON OUR ABILITY

TO IMPROVE OUR PRODUCTS AND PROCESSES, DEVELOP NEW PRODUCTS TO MEET CHANGING CUSTOMER REQUIREMENTS AND REDUCE COSTS. PRICES DECLINE RAPIDLY IN THE SEMICONDUCTOR INDUSTRY AS UNIT VOLUMES GROW, FURTHER

COMPETITION DEVELOPS AND PRODUCTION EXPERIENCE IS ACCUMULATED. MANY COMPANIES COMPETE WITH US IN THE VARIOUS COMPUTING, NETWORKING AND COMMUNICATIONS MARKET SEGMENTS, AND ARE ENGAGED IN THE SAME BASIC

FIELDS OF ACTIVITY, INCLUDING RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT. WORLDWIDE, THESE COMPETITORS RANGE IN SIZE FROM LARGE MULTINATIONAL COMPANIES TO SMALLER COMPANIES COMPETING IN SPECIALIZED MARKET SEGMENTS.

THE

INTEL ARCHITECTURE BUSINESS CONSISTS OF THE DESKTOP PLATFORMS GROUP, THE MOBILE PLATFORMS GROUP AND THE ENTERPRISE PLATFORMS GROUP. OUR STRATEGY FOR THE DESKTOP AND MOBILE PLATFORMS

IS TO INTRODUCE EVER-HIGHER PERFORMANCE MICROPROCESSORS AND CHIPSETS, DEVELOPED FOR DIFFERENT MARKET SEGMENTS OF THE WORLDWIDE COMPUTING MARKET, USING A TIERED BRANDING APPROACH. OUR

STRATEGY FOR THE SERVER PLATFORM IS TO PROVIDE HIGHER PERFORMANCE PROCESSORS AND THE BEST PRICE FOR PERFORMANCE FOR THE

12

VARIOUS MARKET SEGMENTS. IN LINE WITH OUR STRATEGIES, WE SEEK TO DEVELOP HIGHER PERFORMANCE MICROPROCESSORS BASED ON THE INTEL NETBURST MICROARCHITECTURE SPECIFICALLY FOR EACH COMPUTING MARKET

SEGMENT.

OUR

FINANCIAL RESULTS ARE SUBSTANTIALLY DEPENDENT ON SALES OF MICROPROCESSORS BY THE INTEL ARCHITECTURE OPERATING SEGMENT. A NUMBER OF COMPETITORS MARKET SOFTWARE-COMPATIBLE PRODUCTS

INTENDED TO COMPETE WITH INTEL ARCHITECTURE-BASED PROCESSORS. WE ALSO FACE SIGNIFICANT COMPETITION FROM COMPANIES OFFERING RIVAL MICROPROCESSOR ARCHITECTURES. THE CELERON PROCESSOR COMPETES WITH

EXISTING AND FUTURE PRODUCTS IN THE HIGHLY COMPETITIVE VALUE PC MARKET SEGMENT. THE PENTIUM 4 PROCESSOR COMPETES WITH EXISTING AND FUTURE PRODUCTS IN THE PERFORMANCE DESKTOP AND ENTRY-LEVEL

WORKSTATION MARKET SEGMENT. THE MOBILE INTEL PENTIUM 4 PROCESSOR COMPETES WITH EXISTING AND FUTURE PRODUCTS IN THE MOBILE COMPUTING MARKET SEGMENT. WE HAVE EXPERIENCED AN INCREASE IN THE COMPETITIVE

PRODUCT OFFERINGS IN THE PERFORMANCE DESKTOP MARKET SEGMENT AND RECENTLY IN THE MOBILE MARKET SEGMENT. THE PENTIUM III XEON PROCESSOR BASED ON THE P6 ARCHITECTURE AND THE INTEL XEON PROCESSOR BASED ON

THE INTEL NETBURST ARCHITECTURE COMPETE IN THE MID-RANGE AND HIGH-END SERVER AND WORKSTATION MARKET SEGMENTS. THE INTEL ITANIUM PROCESSOR COMPETES IN THE ENTERPRISE-CLASS

SERVER MARKET SEGMENT. THESE THREE PROCESSORS ALL COMPETE WITH ESTABLISHED PRODUCTS BASED ON RIVAL ARCHITECTURES.

MANY

OF OUR COMPETITORS ARE LICENSED TO USE OUR PATENTS. FURTHERMORE, OUR COMPETITORS CAN DESIGN COMPETING PRODUCTS AND AVOID OUR PATENT RIGHTS BY USING CERTAIN FOUNDRY SERVICES THAT

HAVE BROAD LICENSES WITH US THAT, UNDER CURRENT CASE LAW, PERMIT THEM TO PASS OUR PATENT RIGHTS ON TO OTHERS. COMPETITORS' PRODUCTS MAY ADD FEATURES, INCREASE PERFORMANCE OR SELL AT LOWER PRICES. WE

CANNOT PREDICT WHETHER OUR PRODUCTS WILL CONTINUE TO COMPETE SUCCESSFULLY WITH SUCH EXISTING RIVAL ARCHITECTURES OR WHETHER NEW ARCHITECTURES WILL ESTABLISH OR GAIN MARKET ACCEPTANCE OR PROVIDE

INCREASED COMPETITION WITH OUR PRODUCTS. FUTURE DISTORTION OF PRICE MATURITY CURVES COULD OCCUR IF SOFTWARE-COMPATIBLE PRODUCTS ENTER THE MARKET SEGMENT IN SIGNIFICANT VOLUME OR ALTERNATIVE

ARCHITECTURES GAIN MARKET ACCEPTANCE.

WE

PLAN TO CULTIVATE NEW BUSINESSES AS WELL AS CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE COMPUTING INDUSTRY TO EXPAND INTERNET CAPABILITIES AND PRODUCT OFFERINGS, AND DEVELOP COMPELLING SOFTWARE

APPLICATIONS THAT CAN TAKE ADVANTAGE OF HIGHER PERFORMANCE MICROPROCESSORS AND CHIPSETS, INCREASING DEMAND FOR INTEL'S NEWER PRODUCTS IN EACH COMPUTING MARKET SEGMENT. WE MAY CONTINUE TO TAKE VARIOUS

STEPS, INCLUDING REDUCING MICROPROCESSOR PRICES AND/OR OFFERING REBATES AND OTHER INCENTIVES AT SUCH TIMES AS WE DEEM APPROPRIATE, IN ORDER TO INCREASE ACCEPTANCE OF OUR LATEST TECHNOLOGY AND TO

REMAIN COMPETITIVE WITHIN EACH RELEVANT MARKET SEGMENT.

IN

THE INTEL COMMUNICATIONS GROUP, OUR STRATEGY FOR THE NETWORKING AND COMMUNICATIONS PLATFORM IS BASED ON THREE FOCUS AREAS: ETHERNET CONNECTIVITY, OPTICAL COMPONENTS AND NETWORK

PROCESSING COMPONENTS. IN THE THESE AREAS, WE FACE COMPETITION FROM BOTH ESTABLISHED AND EMERGING COMPANIES AND COMPETITORS USE AGGRESSIVE PRODUCT AND ACQUISITION PLANS IN AN EFFORT TO ACHIEVE

LEADING-EDGE MARKET POSITIONS. OUR PRODUCTS ALSO COMPETE IN THE SMALL AND MID-SIZED ENTERPRISE MARKET SEGMENTS WITH ESTABLISHED PRODUCTS AND LEADING EDGE INTERNET

COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEMS AND SERVER PRODUCTS. WE CANNOT PREDICT WHETHER OUR NETWORKING AND COMMUNICATIONS PRODUCTS WILL CONTINUE TO COMPETE SUCCESSFULLY WITH PRODUCTS FROM EXISTING COMPETITORS OR

PRODUCTS FROM NEW ENTRANTS TO THESE MARKET SEGMENTS.

IN

THE WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS BUSINESS, OUR STRATEGY IS TO DELIVER COMPLETE SOLUTIONS THAT ENABLE QUICK DEPLOYMENT OF APPLICATIONS AND SERVICES FOR WIRELESS INTERNET AND PERSONAL

INFORMATION DEVICES. FOR THESE SEGMENTS, WE OFFER FLASH MEMORY PRODUCTS, PROCESSORS BASED ON THE INTEL STRONGARM PROCESSOR AND INTEL XSCALE MICROARCHITECTURE AND BASEBAND CHIPSETS. IN

SUPPLYING THESE PRODUCTS, OUR WIRELESS

COMMUNICATIONS AND COMPUTING GROUP FACES COMPETITION FROM THE PRODUCTS OF ESTABLISHED COMPANIES IN THE FLASH MEMORY MARKET SEGMENT. WE CANNOT PREDICT WHETHER OUR PRODUCTS WILL CONTINUE

13

TO COMPETE WITH EXISTING COMPETITORS IN THE FLASH MEMORY MARKET SEGMENT AND COMPETE WITH NEW ENTRANTS IN THE APPLICATIONS PROCESSOR AND BASEBAND CHIPSET MARKET SEGMENTS.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

WE HAVE MAINTAINED OUR COMPETITIVE POSITION TO A LARGE EXTENT BECAUSE OF OUR EMPHASIS ON RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT. THIS EMPHASIS HAS ENABLED US TO DELIVER

LEADING-EDGE TECHNOLOGY AND HAS PERMITTED OUR CUSTOMERS TO COMMIT TO THE USE OF THESE NEW PRODUCTS IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THEIR OWN PRODUCTS. OUR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES ARE

DIRECTED TOWARD DEVELOPING NEW PRODUCTS; HARDWARE TECHNOLOGIES; MANUFACTURING, PACKAGING AND TESTING PROCESSES, AS WELL AS IMPROVING EXISTING PRODUCTS AND LOWERING COSTS.

WE

PERFORM A SUBSTANTIAL MAJORITY OF THE DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT OF COMPONENTS AND OTHER PRODUCTS IN THE UNITED STATES AT OUR FACILITIES IN CALIFORNIA, OREGON, ARIZONA AND WASHINGTON.

OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES, WE HAVE PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT FACILITIES AT VARIOUS LOCATIONS, INCLUDING ISRAEL, MALAYSIA, INDIA, CHINA AND RUSSIA. WE ALSO MAINTAIN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT FACILITIES IN

CALIFORNIA AND OREGON THAT ARE FOCUSED ON IMPROVING MANUFACTURING PROCESSES, AS WELL AS A FACILITY IN ARIZONA THAT IS DEDICATED TO IMPROVEMENTS IN MANUFACTURING, ASSEMBLY AND TEST PROCESSES.

DURING

THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2001, OUR CUSTOMERS BEGAN SHIPPING SERVERS AND WORKSTATIONS BASED ON THE INTEL ITANIUM PROCESSOR, THE FIRST IN THE FAMILY OF OUR 64-BIT ITANIUM

ARCHITECTURE PRODUCTS. THE INTRODUCTION OF THE ITANIUM PROCESSOR IS AN IMPORTANT TECHNOLOGY LANDMARK FOR BOTH THE END USER AND IT SUPPLIER COMMUNITY.

DURING

THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2001, WE ANNOUNCED TWO TECHNOLOGY BREAKTHROUGHS, INCLUDING THE TERAHERTZ TRANSISTOR AND HYPER-THREADING TECHNOLOGY. BASED ON NEW STRUCTURES AND MATERIALS, A

TERAHERTZ TRANSISTOR IS DESIGNED TO OVERCOME A NUMBER OF THE TECHNICAL BARRIERS TO CONTINUED INDUSTRY PROGRESS ACCORDING TO WHAT IS REFERRED TO AS "MOORE'S LAW". MOORE'S LAW HAS ACCURATELY PREDICTED

THAT THE NUMBER OF TRANSISTORS THAT CAN BE PLACED ON A COMPUTER CHIP WILL DOUBLE APPROXIMATELY EVERY COUPLE OF YEARS. WHEN USED IN FUTURE TECHNOLOGY GENERATIONS, TERAHERTZ TRANSISTORS ARE EXPECTED TO

ENABLE CHIPS WITH 25 TIMES THE NUMBER OF TRANSISTORS OF TODAY'S MICROPROCESSORS, OPERATING AT 10 TIMES THE SPEED, WITH NO INCREASE IN POWER CONSUMPTION OR HEAT DISSIPATION.

HYPER-THREADING

TECHNOLOGY IS A NEW PROCESSOR DESIGN THAT WE EXPECT WILL SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVE SYSTEM PERFORMANCE FOR SERVERS. OUR SIMULTANEOUS MULTI-THREADING DESIGN ALLOWS A SINGLE

PROCESSOR TO MANAGE DATA AS IF IT WERE TWO PROCESSORS BY HANDLING DATA INSTRUCTIONS IN PARALLEL RATHER THAN ONE AT A TIME. USING HYPER-THREADING TECHNOLOGY, DATA INSTRUCTIONS ARE "THREADED" AS

PARALLEL STREAMS FOR PROCESSING.

IN

SEPTEMBER 2001, WE ANNOUNCED THE CREATION OF NEW ORGANIZATION CALLED THE CORPORATE TECHNOLOGY GROUP (CTG), WHICH WILL PROVIDE RESEARCH AND TECHNOLOGY DIRECTION ACROSS PRODUCT

LINES, AND WILL WORK WITH THE INDUSTRY TO CREATE AND DELIVER KEY INDUSTRY SPECIFICATIONS, STANDARDS AND TECHNOLOGIES. AS PART OF THE CREATION OF CTG, WE ALSO ANNOUNCED THE APPOINTMENT A CHIEF

TECHNOLOGY OFFICER.

IN

ADDITION TO MICROPROCESSOR AND CHIPSET RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, WE HAVE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT INITIATIVES IN NETWORKING AND COMMUNICATIONS PRODUCTS, WIRELESS DEVICES, CONNECTED

PERIPHERALS AND OTHER AREAS. THESE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT INITIATIVES INCLUDE PROJECTS SURROUNDING THE INTEL IXA ARCHITECTURE FOR NETWORKING AND COMMUNICATIONS PRODUCTS AND THE INTEL PCA

ARCHITECTURE FOR WIRELESS DEVICES. WE HAVE ALSO ACQUIRED ONGOING RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES IN THESE AREAS WITH BUSINESSES ACQUIRED IN 2001.

OUR

EXPENDITURES FOR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT WERE $3,796 MILLION IN FISCAL 2001, $3,897 MILLION IN FISCAL 2000 AND $3,111 MILLION IN FISCAL 1999. THESE AMOUNTS

EXCLUDE CHARGES FOR PURCHASED IN-PROCESS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT RELATED TO ACQUISITIONS OF $198 MILLION FOR FISCAL 2001, $109 MILLION FOR FISCAL

14

2000 AND $392 MILLION FOR FISCAL 1999. THE DECLINE IN SPENDING BETWEEN 2001 AND 2000 REFLECTS THE IMPACT OF COST CONTAINMENT PROGRAMS INCLUDING REDUCTIONS IN DISCRETIONARY SPENDING ON

TRAVEL-RELATED EXPENSES.

AT

DECEMBER 2001, WE HAD APPROXIMATELY 21,000 EMPLOYEES ENGAGED IN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT. THE SUCCESS OF OUR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES IS DEPENDENT UPON COMPETITIVE

CIRCUMSTANCES AS WELL AS OUR ABILITY TO BRING NEW PRODUCTS TO MARKET IN EACH COMPUTING MARKET SEGMENT AND IN OUR OTHER BUSINESSES IN A TIMELY AND COST-EFFECTIVE MANNER.

ACQUISITIONS AND STRATEGIC INVESTMENTS

DURING 2001, WE ACQUIRED 11 BUSINESSES FOR MORE THAN $1.7 BILLION, AUGMENTING OUR CAPABILITIES IN A NUMBER OF STRATEGIC AREAS. THE COMPANIES ACQUIRED

INCLUDED XIRCOM, VXTEL, LIGHTLOGIC AND COGNET, WHICH ARE DISCUSSED UNDER THE "PRODUCTS" HEADING IN PART I, ITEM 1 OF THIS FORM 10-K IN CONNECTION WITH THE INTEL

COMMUNICATIONS GROUP.

UNDER

OUR INTEL CAPITAL PROGRAM, WE ALSO MAKE EQUITY INVESTMENTS TO FURTHER OUR STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES AND TO SUPPORT OUR KEY BUSINESS INITIATIVES FOR THE DESKTOP AND MOBILE PLATFORMS,

SERVER PLATFORMS, NETWORKING AND COMMUNICATIONS, AND INTERNET SERVICES. WE WANT TO STIMULATE GROWTH IN COMPUTING, COMMUNICATIONS AND THE INTERNET, AND TO GROW THE TOTAL INFORMATION INFRASTRUCTURE, IN

ORDER TO CREATE AND EXPAND MARKETS FOR OUR PRODUCTS. THIS STRATEGIC INVESTMENT PROGRAM HELPS ADVANCE OUR OVERALL MISSION TO BE THE PREEMINENT SUPPLIER OF BUILDING BLOCKS TO THE WORLDWIDE INTERNET

ECONOMY. OUR

STRATEGIC INVESTMENT PROGRAM SEEKS TO INVEST IN COMPANIES THAT CAN SUCCEED AND HAVE AN IMPACT ON THEIR MARKET SEGMENT. WHEN THE STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES OF AN INVESTMENT HAVE BEEN ACHIEVED, OR IF THE

INVESTMENT DIVERGES FROM OUR STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES, WE MAY DECIDE TO DISPOSE OF THE INVESTMENT.

AT

DECEMBER 29, 2001, OUR STRATEGIC INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO WAS VALUED AT APPROXIMATELY $1.7 BILLION. A MAJORITY OF THE PORTFOLIO WAS COMPRISED OF NON-MARKETABLE

EQUITY SECURITIES. OUR ABILITY TO RECOVER OUR INVESTMENTS IN NON-MARKETABLE EQUITY SECURITIES AND TO EARN A RETURN ON THESE INVESTMENTS IS LARGELY DEPENDENT ON EQUITY MARKET CONDITIONS AND

THE OCCURRENCE OF LIQUIDITY EVENTS, SUCH AS INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERINGS, MERGERS AND PRIVATE SALES. ALL OF THESE FACTORS ARE DIFFICULT TO PREDICT, PARTICULARLY IN THE CURRENT ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT. IN

ADDITION, UNDER OUR ACCOUNTING POLICY, WE ARE REQUIRED TO REVIEW ALL OF OUR INVESTMENTS FOR IMPAIRMENT. FOR NON-MARKETABLE EQUITY SECURITIES, THIS REQUIRES SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT, INCLUDING

ASSESSMENT OF THE INVESTEES' FINANCIAL CONDITION, THE EXISTENCE OF SUBSEQUENT ROUNDS OF FINANCING AND THE IMPACT OF ANY RELEVANT CONTRACTUAL PREFERENCES, AS WELL AS THE INVESTEES' HISTORICAL RESULTS

OF OPERATIONS, AND PROJECTED RESULTS OF CASH FLOWS.

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND LICENSING

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS THAT APPLY TO OUR VARIOUS PRODUCTS AND SERVICES INCLUDE PATENTS, COPYRIGHTS, TRADE SECRETS, TRADEMARKS AND MASK WORK RIGHTS. INTEL

HAS ESTABLISHED AN ACTIVE PROGRAM TO PROTECT ITS INVESTMENT IN TECHNOLOGY BY ENFORCING ITS INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS. WE DO NOT INTEND TO LICENSE OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS BROADLY UNLESS WE

CAN OBTAIN ADEQUATE CONSIDERATION. SEE ALSO THE INFORMATION UNDER THE HEADING "COMPETITION" IN PART I, ITEM 1 OF THIS FORM 10-K.

WE

HAVE FILED AND OBTAINED A NUMBER OF PATENTS IN THE UNITED STATES AND ABROAD, AND WE HAVE ENTERED INTO PATENT CROSS-LICENSE AGREEMENTS WITH MANY OF OUR MAJOR COMPETITORS AND OTHER

PARTIES. WHILE OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS ARE IMPORTANT TO OUR SUCCESS, OUR BUSINESS AS A WHOLE IS NOT MATERIALLY DEPENDENT ON ANY PARTICULAR PATENT OR LICENSE. WE AND OTHER COMPANIES IN THE

COMPUTER, TELECOMMUNICATIONS AND RELATED HIGH-TECHNOLOGY FIELDS TYPICALLY APPLY FOR AND RECEIVE, IN THE AGGREGATE, THOUSANDS OF PATENTS ANNUALLY IN THE UNITED STATES AND OTHER COUNTRIES.

IN ADDITION, BECAUSE OF THE FAST PACE OF INNOVATION AND PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT, OUR PRODUCTS ARE OFTEN OBSOLETE BEFORE THE PATENTS RELATED TO THEM EXPIRE. AS A RESULT, WE BELIEVE THAT THE DURATION OF THE

APPLICABLE PATENTS IS ADEQUATE RELATIVE TO THE EXPECTED LIVES OF OUR PRODUCTS.

WE PROTECT MANY OF OUR COMPUTER PROGRAMS BY COPYRIGHTING THEM, AND WE HAVE REGISTERED NUMEROUS COPYRIGHTS WITH THE UNITED STATES COPYRIGHT OFFICE. IN SOME NON-U.S.

JURISDICTIONS, THE ABILITY TO PROTECT OR COPYRIGHT SOFTWARE IN IS NOT CLEAR, BUT IT IS OUR POLICY TO REQUIRE CUSTOMERS TO OBTAIN A SOFTWARE LICENSE CONTRACT BEFORE WE PROVIDE THEM WITH CERTAIN

COMPUTER PROGRAMS. CERTAIN COMPONENTS CONTAIN EMBEDDED COMPUTER PROGRAMS, AND WE HAVE ALSO OBTAINED COPYRIGHT PROTECTION FOR SOME OF THESE PROGRAMS. IN ADDITION, WE HAVE OBTAINED PROTECTION FOR THE

MASK WORKS FOR A NUMBER OF OUR COMPONENTS UNDER THE CHIP PROTECTION ACT OF 1984.

WE

HAVE OBTAINED CERTAIN TRADEMARKS AND TRADE NAMES FOR OUR PRODUCTS TO DISTINGUISH GENUINE INTEL PRODUCTS FROM OUR COMPETITORS' PRODUCTS, AND WE ARE CURRENTLY ENGAGED IN A COOPERATIVE

PROGRAM WITH OEMS TO IDENTIFY WITH THE INTEL INSIDE® LOGO CERTAIN PERSONAL COMPUTERS CONTAINING GENUINE INTEL MICROPROCESSORS. WE ALSO MAINTAIN CERTAIN DETAILS ABOUT OUR PROCESSES,

PRODUCTS AND STRATEGIES AS TRADE SECRETS.

LIKE

MANY COMPANIES IN THE SEMICONDUCTOR AND OTHER HIGH-TECHNOLOGY INDUSTRIES, WE HAVE FROM TIME TO TIME BEEN NOTIFIED OF CLAIMS THAT WE MAY BE INFRINGING CERTAIN

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS OF OTHERS. THESE CLAIMS HAVE BEEN REFERRED TO COUNSEL, AND THEY ARE IN VARIOUS STAGES OF EVALUATION AND NEGOTIATION. IF IT APPEARS NECESSARY OR DESIRABLE, WE MAY SEEK

LICENSES FOR THESE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS. WE CAN GIVE NO ASSURANCE THAT LICENSES WILL BE OFFERED BY ALL CLAIMANTS, THAT THE TERMS OF ANY OFFERED LICENSES WILL BE ACCEPTABLE TO US OR THAT IN ALL

CASES THE DISPUTE WILL BE RESOLVED WITHOUT LITIGATION, WHICH MAY BE TIME CONSUMING AND EXPENSIVE, AND MAY RESULT IN INJUNCTIVE RELIEF OR THE PAYMENT OF DAMAGES BY US. SEE ALSO THE INFORMATION UNDER

THE HEADING "LEGAL PROCEEDINGS" IN PART I, ITEM 3 OF THIS FORM 10-K.

COMPLIANCE WITH ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS

TO OUR PRESENT KNOWLEDGE, COMPLIANCE WITH FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL PROVISIONS ENACTED OR ADOPTED FOR PROTECTION OF THE ENVIRONMENT HAS HAD NO MATERIAL EFFECT UPON

OUR OPERATIONS. WE ALSO REFER TO THE INFORMATION UNDER THE HEADING "LEGAL PROCEEDINGS" IN PART I, ITEM 3 OF THIS FORM 10-K.

ITEM 3.    LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

A. LITIGATION

INTERGRAPH CORPORATION V. INTEL

U.S. DISTRICT COURT, NORTHERN DISTRICT OF ALABAMA, NORTHEASTERN DIVISION

U.S. DISTRICT COURT, EASTERN DISTRICT OF TEXAS

IN

NOVEMBER 1997, INTERGRAPH CORPORATION FILED SUIT IN FEDERAL DISTRICT COURT IN ALABAMA, GENERALLY ALLEGING THAT INTEL ATTEMPTED TO COERCE INTERGRAPH INTO RELINQUISHING CERTAIN

PATENT RIGHTS. THE SUIT ALLEGES THAT INTEL INFRINGES FIVE INTERGRAPH MICROPROCESSOR-RELATED PATENTS AND INCLUDES ALLEGED VIOLATIONS OF ANTITRUST LAWS AND VARIOUS STATE LAW CLAIMS. THE SUIT SEEKS

INJUNCTIVE RELIEF, DAMAGES AND PREJUDGMENT INTEREST, AND FURTHER ALLEGES THAT INTEL'S INFRINGEMENT IS WILLFUL AND THAT ANY DAMAGES AWARDED SHOULD BE TREBLED. INTERGRAPH'S EXPERT WITNESS HAS CLAIMED

THAT INTERGRAPH IS ENTITLED TO DAMAGES OF APPROXIMATELY $2.2 BILLION FOR INTEL'S ALLEGED PATENT INFRINGEMENT AND APPROXIMATELY $350 MILLION FOR ALLEGED STATE LAW VIOLATIONS, PLUS

PREJUDGMENT INTEREST. INTEL HAS COUNTERCLAIMED, ALLEGING INFRINGEMENT OF SEVEN INTEL PATENTS, BREACH OF CONTRACT AND MISAPPROPRIATION OF TRADE SECRETS. IN MARCH 2000, THE DISTRICT COURT GRANTED

INTEL'S MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT ON INTERGRAPH'S FEDERAL ANTITRUST CLAIMS, AND IN JUNE 2001, THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE FEDERAL CIRCUIT SUSTAINED THE DISTRICT COURT'S RULING.

INTERGRAPH'S PATENT AND STATE LAW CLAIMS REMAIN AT ISSUE IN THE TRIAL COURT. THE COMPANY DISPUTES THE PLAINTIFF'S CLAIMS AND INTENDS TO DEFEND THE LAWSUIT VIGOROUSLY.

IN

AUGUST 2001, INTERGRAPH FILED A SECOND SUIT IN THE U.S. DISTRICT COURT FOR THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF TEXAS, ALLEGING THAT THE INTEL ITANIUM PROCESSOR INFRINGES TWO INTERGRAPH

MICROPROCESSOR-RELATED PATENTS, AND SEEKING AN INJUNCTION AND UNSPECIFIED DAMAGES. INTERGRAPH HAS WITHDRAWN ITS REQUEST FOR DAMAGES AND, CONSEQUENTLY, INTERGRAPH'S SOLE REQUESTED REMEDY IS AN

INJUNCTION THAT WOULD PROHIBIT INTEL FROM MAKING, USING OR SELLING ITANIUM PROCESSORS. IF GRANTED, SUCH AN INJUNCTION WOULD SIGNIFICANTLY LIMIT INTEL'S ABILITY TO SUCCEED IN THE ENTERPRISE SERVER

MARKET SEGMENT FOR 64-BIT PROCESSORS. THE TEXAS SUIT IS CURRENTLY SCHEDULED FOR TRIAL BEFORE JUDGE WARD, SITTING WITHOUT A JURY, IN JULY 2002. THE COMPANY DISPUTES PLAINTIFF'S

CLAIMS AND INTENDS TO DEFEND THE LAWSUITS VIGOROUSLY.

EDWARD HARRIS, ET AL V. INTEL CORPORATION, ET AL

U.S. DISTRICT COURT, NORTHERN CALIFORNIA

ON

MAY 1, 2000, VARIOUS PLAINTIFFS FILED A CLASS-ACTION LAWSUIT IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA, ALLEGING VIOLATIONS OF THE SECURITIES

EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934 AND U.S. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (SEC) RULE 14D-10 IN CONNECTION WITH INTEL'S ACQUISITION OF DSP COMMUNICATIONS, INC. THE COMPLAINT ALLEGES

THAT INTEL AND CWC (INTEL'S WHOLLY OWNED SUBSIDIARY AT THE TIME) AGREED TO PAY CERTAIN DSP COMMUNICATIONS INSIDERS ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATION OF $15.6 MILLION NOT OFFERED OR PAID TO OTHER

STOCKHOLDERS. THE ALLEGED PURPOSE OF THIS PAYMENT TO THE INSIDERS WAS TO OBTAIN DSP COMMUNICATIONS INSIDERS' ENDORSEMENT OF INTEL'S TENDER OFFER IN VIOLATION OF THE ANTI-DISCRIMINATION

PROVISION OF SECTION 14(D)(7) AND RULE 14D-10. THE PLAINTIFFS ARE SEEKING UNSPECIFIED DAMAGES FOR THE CLASS, AND UNSPECIFIED COSTS AND EXPENSES. THE SUIT IS CURRENTLY

SCHEDULED FOR TRIAL IN JULY 2002; HOWEVER, THE PRESIDING JUDGE HAS RETIRED AND THE CASE HAS BEEN REASSIGNED. THE COMPANY DISPUTES THE PLAINTIFFS' CLAIMS AND INTENDS TO DEFEND THE LAWSUIT

VIGOROUSLY.

VIA TECHNOLOGIES, INC. AND CENTAUR TECHNOLOGY, INC. V. INTEL

U.S. DISTRICT COURT, WESTERN DISTRICT OF TEXAS

ON

SEPTEMBER 10, 2001, VIA TECHNOLOGIES, INC. AND CENTAUR TECHNOLOGY, INC. SUED INTEL IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE WESTERN DISTRICT OF TEXAS, ALLEGING

THAT THE INTEL PENTIUM 4 PROCESSOR INFRINGES A VIA TECHNOLOGIES MICROPROCESSOR-RELATED PATENT. THE SUIT SEEKS INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

19

AND DAMAGES IN AN UNSPECIFIED AMOUNT. THE COMPANY DISPUTES THE PLAINTIFFS' CLAIMS AND INTENDS TO DEFEND THE LAWSUIT VIGOROUSLY.

HAWAII REINFORCING IRON WORKERS PENSION TRUST FUND, ET AL. V. INTEL, U.S. DIST. COURT., NORTHERN CALIF.

GEORGE PINEL, ET AL V. INTEL, U.S. DIST. COURT., NORTHERN CALIF.

FAIRLAND MANAGEMENT CORP., ET AL V. INTEL, U.S. DIST. COURT., NORTHERN CALIF.

DR. JAYANT S. PATEL, ET AL V. INTEL, ET AL, CALIF. SUPERIOR COURT, SANTA CLARA COUNTY

IN

SEPTEMBER, OCTOBER AND NOVEMBER 2001, VARIOUS PLAINTIFFS FILED LAWSUITS AGAINST INTEL ALLEGING VIOLATIONS OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934. THE FIVE CLASS-ACTION

COMPLAINTS ALLEGE THAT PURCHASERS OF INTEL STOCK BETWEEN JULY 19, 2000 AND SEPTEMBER 29, 2000 WERE MISLED BY FALSE AND MISLEADING STATEMENTS BY INTEL AND CERTAIN OF ITS OFFICERS AND

DIRECTORS CONCERNING THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. IN ADDITION, STOCKHOLDER DERIVATIVE COMPLAINTS HAVE BEEN FILED IN CALIFORNIA SUPERIOR COURT AND DELAWARE CHANCERY COURT AGAINST THE

COMPANY'S DIRECTORS AND CERTAIN OFFICERS, ALLEGING THAT THEY HAVE MISMANAGED THE COMPANY AND OTHERWISE BREACHED THEIR FIDUCIARY OBLIGATIONS TO THE COMPANY. ALL COMPLAINTS SEEK UNSPECIFIED DAMAGES. THE

COMPANY DISPUTES THE PLAINTIFFS' CLAIMS AND INTENDS TO DEFEND THE LAWSUITS VIGOROUSLY.

WE

CURRENTLY ARE A PARTY TO VARIOUS LEGAL PROCEEDINGS, INCLUDING THOSE NOTED ABOVE. WHILE MANAGEMENT, INCLUDING INTERNAL COUNSEL, CURRENTLY BELIEVES THAT THE ULTIMATE OUTCOME OF THESE

PROCEEDINGS, INDIVIDUALLY AND IN THE AGGREGATE, WILL NOT HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL POSITION OR OVERALL TRENDS IN RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, LITIGATION IS SUBJECT TO INHERENT

UNCERTAINTIES. WERE AN UNFAVORABLE RULING TO OCCUR, THERE EXISTS THE POSSIBILITY OF A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON THE NET INCOME OF THE PERIOD IN WHICH THE RULING OCCURS. THE ESTIMATE OF THE POTENTIAL

IMPACT ON OUR FINANCIAL POSITION OR OVERALL RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE ABOVE LEGAL PROCEEDINGS COULD CHANGE IN THE FUTURE.

B. ENVIRONMENTAL PROCEEDINGS

WE HAVE BEEN NAMED TO THE CALIFORNIA AND U.S. SUPERFUND LISTS FOR THREE OF OUR SITES AND HAVE COMPLETED, ALONG WITH TWO OTHER COMPANIES, A REMEDIAL

INVESTIGATION/FEASIBILITY STUDY WITH THE U.S. ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY (EPA) TO EVALUATE THE GROUNDWATER IN AREAS ADJACENT TO ONE OF OUR FORMER SITES. THE EPA HAS ISSUED A RECORD OF DECISION

WITH RESPECT TO A GROUNDWATER CLEANUP PLAN AT THAT SITE, INCLUDING EXPECTED COSTS TO COMPLETE. UNDER THE CALIFORNIA AND U.S. SUPERFUND STATUTES, LIABILITY FOR CLEANUP OF THIS SITE AND THE ADJACENT

AREA IS JOINT AND SEVERAL. WE HAVE REACHED AGREEMENT, HOWEVER, WITH THOSE SAME TWO COMPANIES THAT SIGNIFICANTLY LIMITS OUR LIABILITIES UNDER THE PROPOSED CLEANUP PLAN. IN ADDITION, WE HAVE COMPLETED

EXTENSIVE STUDIES AT OUR OTHER SITES AND ARE ENGAGED IN CLEANUP AT SEVERAL OF THESE SITES. IN THE OPINION OF MANAGEMENT, INCLUDING INTERNAL COUNSEL, THE POTENTIAL LOSSES TO US IN EXCESS OF AMOUNTS

ALREADY ACCRUED ARISING OUT OF THESE MATTERS WOULD NOT HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL POSITION OR OVERALL TRENDS IN RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, EVEN IF JOINT AND SEVERAL LIABILITY WERE TO

BE ASSESSED.
