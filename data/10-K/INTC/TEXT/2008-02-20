®

AMT), WHICH HELPS INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY MANAGERS DIAGNOSE, FIX,

AND PROTECT ENABLED SYSTEMS THAT ARE PLUGGED INTO A POWER SOURCE

AND CONNECTED TO A NETWORK, EVEN IF A COMPUTER IS TURNED OFF OR

HAS A FAILED HARD DRIVE OR OPERATING SYSTEM. WE ALSO OFFER

INTEL

®

VIRTUALIZATION TECHNOLOGY

(INTEL

®

VT), WHICH CAN ENABLE A SINGLE COMPUTER SYSTEM TO FUNCTION AS

MULTIPLE VIRTUAL SYSTEMS BY RUNNING MULTIPLE OPERATING SYSTEMS

AND APPLICATIONS, THEREBY CONSOLIDATING WORKLOADS AND PROVIDING

INCREASED SECURITY AND MANAGEMENT CAPABILITIES. IN ADDITION, OUR

INTEL

®

CORE

TM

MICROARCHITECTURE INCLUDES OTHER FEATURES THAT CAN INCREASE

PERFORMANCE AND ENERGY EFFICIENCY. TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THESE

FEATURES, A COMPUTER SYSTEM MUST HAVE A MICROPROCESSOR THAT

SUPPORTS A CHIPSET AND BIOS (BASIC INPUT/OUTPUT SYSTEM) THAT

USE, AND SOFTWARE THAT IS OPTIMIZED FOR, THE TECHNOLOGY.

PERFORMANCE WILL VARY DEPENDING ON THE SYSTEM HARDWARE AND

SOFTWARE USED.

1

TABLE OF CONTENTS

WE OFFER PLATFORMS THAT INCORPORATE VARIOUS COMPONENTS AND

TECHNOLOGIES. A PLATFORM TYPICALLY INCLUDES A MICROPROCESSOR,

CHIPSET, AND ENABLING SOFTWARE AND MAY INCLUDE ADDITIONAL

HARDWARE, SERVICES, AND SUPPORT. IN DEVELOPING OUR PLATFORMS, WE

MAY INCLUDE COMPONENTS MADE BY OTHER COMPANIES. A COMPONENT IS

ONE OF ANY NUMBER OF SOFTWARE OR HARDWARE FEATURES THAT MAY BE

INCORPORATED INTO A COMPUTER, HANDHELD DEVICE, OR OTHER

COMPUTING SYSTEM, INCLUDING A MICROPROCESSOR, CHIPSET,

MOTHERBOARD, MEMORY, WIRED OR WIRELESS CONNECTIVITY DEVICE, OR

SOFTWARE. WE REFER TO THE PLATFORM BRANDS WITHIN OUR PRODUCT

OFFERINGS AS PROCESSOR TECHNOLOGIES.

WE STRIVE TO DESIGN COMPUTING AND COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEMS AND

DEVICES WITH IMPROVED OVERALL PERFORMANCE AND/OR IMPROVED

ENERGY-EFFICIENT

PERFORMANCE. IMPROVED OVERALL PERFORMANCE CAN INCLUDE FASTER

PROCESSING PERFORMANCE AND OTHER IMPROVED CAPABILITIES SUCH AS

MULTITHREADING AND MULTITASKING. PERFORMANCE CAN ALSO BE

IMPROVED THROUGH ENHANCED CONNECTIVITY, SECURITY, MANAGEABILITY,

UTILIZATION, RELIABILITY, EASE OF USE, AND INTEROPERABILITY

AMONG DEVICES. IMPROVED ENERGY-EFFICIENT PERFORMANCE INVOLVES

BALANCING THE ADDITION OF IMPROVED PERFORMANCE FACTORS WITH

LOWER POWER CONSUMPTION. LOWER POWER CONSUMPTION MAY REDUCE

SYSTEM HEAT OUTPUT, THEREBY PROVIDING POWER SAVINGS AND REDUCING

THE TOTAL COST OF OWNERSHIP FOR THE USER.

FOLLOWING IS DETAILED INFORMATION ON OUR MAJOR PRODUCT

CATEGORIES.

A

MICROPROCESSOR

IS THE CENTRAL PROCESSING UNIT (CPU) OF

A COMPUTER SYSTEM. IT PROCESSES SYSTEM DATA AND CONTROLS OTHER

DEVICES IN THE SYSTEM, ACTING AS THE BRAINS OF THE

COMPUTER. THE FOLLOWING CHARACTERISTICS OF A MICROPROCESSOR MAY

AFFECT OVERALL PERFORMANCE.



MULTI-CORE PROCESSORS.

MULTI-CORE PROCESSORS CONTAIN

TWO OR MORE PROCESSOR CORES, WHICH ENABLE IMPROVED MULTITASKING

AND ENERGY-EFFICIENT PERFORMANCE BECAUSE COMPUTING TASKS CAN BE

DISTRIBUTED ACROSS MULTIPLE CORES.



CPU DESIGN.

MICROPROCESSOR DESIGN CAN REFER TO THE

MICROARCHITECTURE AND/OR THE ARCHITECTURE. WE USE THE TERM

MICROARCHITECTURE WHEN REFERRING TO THE LAYOUT,

DENSITY, AND LOGICAL DESIGN OF EACH PRODUCT GENERATION. THE TERM

ARCHITECTURE GENERALLY REFERS TO THE LARGEST SIZE OF

NUMERICAL DATA THAT A MICROPROCESSOR CAN HANDLE, MEASURED IN

BITS (THE SMALLEST UNIT OF INFORMATION).

INTEL

®

ITANIUM

®

BRANDED PRODUCTS ARE BASED ON OUR 64-BIT ARCHITECTURE (IA-64);

OUR OTHER MICROPROCESSOR PRODUCTS ARE BASED ON OUR 32-BIT

ARCHITECTURE (IA-32). MICROPROCESSORS WITH 64-BIT PROCESSING

CAPABILITY CAN ADDRESS SIGNIFICANTLY MORE MEMORY THAN 32-BIT

MICROPROCESSORS. ONE WAY TO PROVIDE 64-BIT PROCESSING CAPABILITY

IS FOR PROCESSORS BASED ON 32-BIT ARCHITECTURE TO HAVE 64-BIT

ADDRESS EXTENSIONS. THE MAJORITY OF OUR MICROPROCESSORS ARE

EQUIPPED WITH

INTEL

®

64 ARCHITECTURE, WHICH PROVIDES 64-BIT ADDRESS EXTENSIONS,

SUPPORTING BOTH 32-BIT AND 64-BIT SOFTWARE APPLICATIONS.



CLOCK SPEED.

CLOCK SPEED IS THE RATE AT WHICH A

MICROPROCESSORS INTERNAL LOGIC OPERATES AND IS ONE MEASURE

OF A MICROPROCESSORS PERFORMANCE.



MEMORY SIZE AND ACCESS SPEED.

CACHE IS A MEMORY THAT

CAN BE LOCATED DIRECTLY ON THE MICROPROCESSOR, PERMITTING

QUICKER ACCESS TO FREQUENTLY USED DATA AND INSTRUCTIONS. SOME OF

OUR MICROPROCESSORS HAVE ADDITIONAL LEVELS OF CACHE TO ENABLE

HIGHER LEVELS OF PERFORMANCE. MEMORY STORAGE IS MEASURED IN

BYTES (8 BITS PER BYTE), WITH 1,024 BYTES EQUALING A KILOBYTE

(KB), 1.049 MILLION BYTES EQUALING A MEGABYTE (MB), AND

1.074 BILLION BYTES EQUALING A GIGABYTE (GB).



SPEED OF COMMUNICATION BETWEEN THE CPU AND THE

CHIPSET.

A BUS CARRIES DATA BETWEEN PARTS OF THE

SYSTEM. A FASTER BUS ALLOWS FOR FASTER DATA TRANSFER INTO AND

OUT OF THE PROCESSOR, ENABLING INCREASED PERFORMANCE.

THE

CHIPSET

OPERATES AS THE PCS NERVOUS

SYSTEM, SENDING DATA BETWEEN THE MICROPROCESSOR AND INPUT,

DISPLAY, AND STORAGE DEVICES, SUCH AS THE KEYBOARD, MOUSE,

MONITOR, HARD DRIVE, AND CD OR DVD DRIVE. CHIPSETS PERFORM

ESSENTIAL LOGIC FUNCTIONS, SUCH AS BALANCING THE PERFORMANCE OF

THE SYSTEM AND REMOVING BOTTLENECKS. CHIPSETS ALSO EXTEND THE

GRAPHICS, AUDIO, VIDEO, AND OTHER CAPABILITIES OF MANY SYSTEMS

BASED ON OUR MICROPROCESSORS. FINALLY, CHIPSETS CONTROL THE

ACCESS BETWEEN THE CPU AND MAIN MEMORY.

A

MOTHERBOARD

IS THE PRINCIPAL BOARD WITHIN A SYSTEM. A

MOTHERBOARD HAS CONNECTORS FOR ATTACHING DEVICES TO THE BUS, AND

TYPICALLY CONTAINS THE CPU, MEMORY, AND THE CHIPSET.

FLASH MEMORY

IS A SPECIALIZED TYPE OF MEMORY COMPONENT

USED TO STORE USER DATA AND PROGRAM CODE; IT RETAINS THIS

INFORMATION EVEN WHEN THE POWER IS OFF, AND PROVIDES FASTER

ACCESS TO DATA THAN TRADITIONAL HARD DRIVES. FLASH MEMORY HAS NO

MOVING PARTS, UNLIKE DEVICES SUCH AS RAPIDLY SPINNING DISK

DRIVES, ALLOWING FLASH MEMORY TO BE MORE TOLERANT OF BUMPS AND

SHOCKS. FLASH MEMORY IS BASED ON EITHER NOR OR NAND

ARCHITECTURE. NOR FLASH MEMORY, WITH ITS FAST ACCESS OR

READ CAPABILITIES, HAS TRADITIONALLY BEEN USED TO

STORE EXECUTABLE CODE. NAND FLASH MEMORY, WHICH IS SLOWER IN

READING DATA BUT FASTER IN WRITING DATA, HAS BECOME THE

PREFERRED FLASH MEMORY FOR STORING LARGE QUANTITIES OF DATA.

MANUFACTURING

AND ASSEMBLY AND TEST

AS OF DECEMBER 29, 2007, 73% OF OUR WAFER FABRICATION,

INCLUDING MICROPROCESSOR, CHIPSET, NOR FLASH MEMORY,

COMMUNICATIONS, AND OTHER SILICON FABRICATION, WAS CONDUCTED

WITHIN THE U.S. AT OUR FACILITIES IN ARIZONA, NEW MEXICO,

OREGON, MASSACHUSETTS, AND CALIFORNIA. THE REMAINING 27% OF OUR

WAFER FABRICATION WAS CONDUCTED OUTSIDE THE U.S. AT OUR

FACILITIES IN IRELAND AND ISRAEL.

AS OF DECEMBER 29, 2007, WE PRIMARILY MANUFACTURED OUR

PRODUCTS IN WAFER FABRICATION FACILITIES AT THE FOLLOWING

LOCATIONS.

WE EXPECT TO INCREASE THE CAPACITY OF CERTAIN FACILITIES LISTED

ABOVE THROUGH ADDITIONAL INVESTMENTS IN CAPITAL EQUIPMENT. IN

ADDITION TO OUR CURRENT FACILITIES, WE ARE BUILDING A FACILITY

IN ISRAEL THAT IS EXPECTED TO BEGIN WAFER FABRICATION FOR

MICROPROCESSORS ON 300MM WAFERS USING 45NM PROCESS TECHNOLOGY IN

THE SECOND HALF OF 2008. ALSO, WE ARE BUILDING A 300MM WAFER

FABRICATION FACILITY IN CHINA THAT IS EXPECTED TO BEGIN

PRODUCTION IN 2010.

AS OF DECEMBER 29, 2007, THE MAJORITY OF OUR

MICROPROCESSORS WERE MANUFACTURED ON 300MM WAFERS USING OUR 65NM

PROCESS TECHNOLOGY. IN 2007, WE STARTED MANUFACTURING

MICROPROCESSORS USING OUR NEW 45NM PROCESS TECHNOLOGY, WHICH

ENABLES HIGHER AND MORE ENERGY-EFFICIENT PROCESSOR PERFORMANCE.

THE BENEFITS OF MOVING TO EACH SUCCEEDING GENERATION OF

MANUFACTURING PROCESS TECHNOLOGY CAN INCLUDE USING LESS SPACE

PER TRANSISTOR, REDUCING HEAT OUTPUT FROM EACH TRANSISTOR,

AND/OR INCREASING THE NUMBER OF INTEGRATED FEATURES ON EACH

CHIP. THESE ADVANCEMENTS CAN RESULT IN MICROPROCESSORS THAT ARE

HIGHER PERFORMING, CONSUME LESS POWER, AND/OR COST LESS TO

MANUFACTURE.

TO AUGMENT CAPACITY, WE USE THIRD-PARTY MANUFACTURING COMPANIES

(FOUNDRIES) TO MANUFACTURE WAFERS FOR CERTAIN COMPONENTS,

INCLUDING CHIPSET, NETWORKING, AND COMMUNICATIONS PRODUCTS. IN

ADDITION, WE PRIMARILY USE SUBCONTRACTORS TO MANUFACTURE

BOARD-LEVEL PRODUCTS AND SYSTEMS, AND PURCHASE CERTAIN

COMMUNICATIONS NETWORKING PRODUCTS FROM EXTERNAL VENDORS,

PRINCIPALLY IN THE ASIA-PACIFIC REGION.

OUR NAND FLASH MEMORY PRODUCTS ARE MANUFACTURED BY IMFT, A NAND

FLASH MEMORY MANUFACTURING COMPANY THAT WE FORMED WITH MICRON

TECHNOLOGY, INC. IN 2006. WE CURRENTLY PURCHASE 49% OF THE

MANUFACTURED OUTPUT OF IMFT. SEE NOTE 19.

VENTURES IN PART II, ITEM 8 OF THIS

FORM 10-K.

FOLLOWING THE MANUFACTURING PROCESS, THE MAJORITY OF OUR

COMPONENTS ARE SUBJECT TO ASSEMBLY AND TEST. WE PERFORM OUR

COMPONENTS ASSEMBLY AND TEST AT FACILITIES IN MALAYSIA, CHINA,

THE PHILIPPINES, AND COSTA RICA. WE PLAN TO CONTINUE INVESTING

IN NEW ASSEMBLY AND TEST TECHNOLOGIES AS WELL AS INCREASING THE

CAPACITY OF OUR EXISTING FACILITIES AND BUILDING NEW FACILITIES

TO KEEP PACE WITH OUR MICROPROCESSOR, CHIPSET, AND

COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY IMPROVEMENTS. IN LINE WITH THESE

PLANS, WE ARE BUILDING A NEW ASSEMBLY AND TEST FACILITY IN

VIETNAM, WHICH IS EXPECTED TO BEGIN PRODUCTION IN 2009. THIS

FACILITY WILL HAVE GREATER SQUARE FOOTAGE THAN EACH OF OUR

CURRENT FACILITIES, WHICH WILL ENABLE US TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF

GREATER ECONOMIES OF SCALE. TO AUGMENT CAPACITY, WE USE

SUBCONTRACTORS TO PERFORM ASSEMBLY OF CERTAIN PRODUCTS,

PRIMARILY FLASH MEMORY, CHIPSETS, AND NETWORKING AND

COMMUNICATIONS PRODUCTS. ASSEMBLY AND TEST OF NAND FLASH MEMORY

PRODUCTS, MANUFACTURED BY IMFT, IS PERFORMED BY MICRON AND OTHER

EXTERNAL SUBCONTRACTORS.

OUR EMPLOYMENT PRACTICES ARE CONSISTENT WITH, AND WE EXPECT OUR

SUPPLIERS AND SUBCONTRACTORS TO ABIDE BY, LOCAL COUNTRY LAW. IN

ADDITION, WE IMPOSE A MINIMUM EMPLOYEE AGE REQUIREMENT AS WELL

AS PROGRESSIVE ENVIRONMENTAL, HEALTH, AND SAFETY REQUIREMENTS

REGARDLESS OF LOCAL LAW.

WE HAVE THOUSANDS OF SUPPLIERS, INCLUDING SUBCONTRACTORS,

PROVIDING OUR VARIOUS MATERIALS AND SERVICE NEEDS. WE SET

EXPECTATIONS FOR SUPPLIER PERFORMANCE AND REINFORCE THOSE

EXPECTATIONS WITH PERIODIC ASSESSMENTS. WE COMMUNICATE THOSE

EXPECTATIONS TO OUR SUPPLIERS REGULARLY AND WORK WITH THEM TO

IMPLEMENT IMPROVEMENTS WHEN NECESSARY. WE SEEK, WHERE POSSIBLE,

TO HAVE SEVERAL SOURCES OF SUPPLY FOR ALL OF THESE MATERIALS AND

RESOURCES, BUT WE MAY RELY ON A SINGLE OR LIMITED NUMBER OF

SUPPLIERS, OR UPON SUPPLIERS IN A SINGLE COUNTRY. IN THOSE

CASES, WE DEVELOP AND IMPLEMENT PLANS AND ACTIONS TO REDUCE THE

EXPOSURE THAT WOULD RESULT FROM A DISRUPTION IN SUPPLY. WE HAVE

ENTERED INTO LONG-TERM CONTRACTS WITH CERTAIN SUPPLIERS TO

ENSURE A PORTION OF OUR SILICON SUPPLY.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

OUR PRODUCTS TYPICALLY ARE PRODUCED AT MULTIPLE INTEL FACILITIES

AT VARIOUS SITES AROUND THE WORLD, OR BY SUBCONTRACTORS WHO HAVE

MULTIPLE FACILITIES. HOWEVER, SOME PRODUCTS ARE PRODUCED IN ONLY

ONE INTEL OR SUBCONTRACTOR FACILITY, AND WE SEEK TO IMPLEMENT

ACTIONS AND PLANS TO REDUCE THE EXPOSURE THAT WOULD RESULT FROM

A DISRUPTION AT ANY SUCH FACILITY. SEE RISK FACTORS

RESEARCH

AND DEVELOPMENT

WE ARE COMMITTED TO INVESTING IN WORLD-CLASS TECHNOLOGY

DEVELOPMENT, PARTICULARLY IN THE AREA OF THE DESIGN AND

MANUFACTURE OF INTEGRATED CIRCUITS. RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

(R&D) EXPENDITURES IN 2007 WERE $5.8 BILLION

($5.9 BILLION IN FISCAL YEAR 2006 AND $5.1 BILLION IN

FISCAL YEAR 2005).

OUR R&D ACTIVITIES ARE DIRECTED TOWARD DEVELOPING THE

TECHNOLOGY INNOVATIONS THAT WE BELIEVE WILL DELIVER OUR NEXT

GENERATION OF PRODUCTS AND PLATFORMS, WHICH WILL IN TURN ENABLE

NEW FORM FACTORS AND NEW USAGE MODELS FOR BUSINESSES AND

CONSUMERS. OUR R&D ACTIVITIES RANGE FROM DESIGN AND

DEVELOPMENT OF PRODUCTS TO DEVELOPING AND REFINING MANUFACTURING

PROCESSES, AS WELL AS RESEARCHING FUTURE TECHNOLOGIES AND

PRODUCTS.

WE ARE FOCUSING OUR R&D EFFORTS ON ADVANCED COMPUTING,

COMMUNICATIONS, AND WIRELESS TECHNOLOGIES AS WELL AS ENERGY

EFFICIENCY BY DEVELOPING NEW MICROARCHITECTURES, ADVANCING OUR

SILICON MANUFACTURING PROCESS TECHNOLOGY, DELIVERING THE NEXT

GENERATION OF MICROPROCESSORS AND CHIPSETS, IMPROVING OUR

PLATFORM INITIATIVES, AND DEVELOPING SOFTWARE SOLUTIONS AND

TOOLS TO SUPPORT OUR TECHNOLOGIES. OUR R&D EFFORTS ENABLE

NEW LEVELS OF PERFORMANCE AND ADDRESS AREAS SUCH AS SCALABILITY

FOR MULTI-CORE ARCHITECTURES, SYSTEM MANAGEABILITY AND SECURITY,

ENERGY EFFICIENCY, DIGITAL CONTENT PROTECTION, EASE OF USE, AND

NEW COMMUNICATIONS CAPABILITIES. IN THE AREA OF WIRELESS

COMMUNICATIONS, OUR INITIATIVES FOCUS ON DELIVERING THE

TECHNOLOGIES THAT WILL ENABLE IMPROVED WIRELESS CAPABILITIES,

INCLUDING EXPANDING AND PROLIFERATING WIMAX TECHNOLOGIES AND

PRODUCTS.

AS PART OF OUR R&D EFFORTS, WE PLAN TO INTRODUCE A NEW

MICROARCHITECTURE FOR OUR MOBILE, DESKTOP, AND INTEL XEON

PROCESSORS APPROXIMATELY EVERY TWO YEARS AND RAMP THE NEXT

GENERATION OF SILICON PROCESS TECHNOLOGY IN THE INTERVENING

YEARS. WE REFER TO THIS AS OUR TICK-TOCK TECHNOLOGY

DEVELOPMENT CADENCE. OUR LEADERSHIP IN SILICON TECHNOLOGY HAS

ENABLED US TO MAKE MOORES LAW A REALITY.

MOORES LAW PREDICTED THAT TRANSISTOR DENSITY ON INTEGRATED

CIRCUITS WOULD DOUBLE ABOUT EVERY TWO YEARS. OUR LEADERSHIP IN

SILICON TECHNOLOGY HAS ALSO HELPED TO EXPAND ON THE ADVANCES

ANTICIPATED BY MOORES LAW BY BRINGING NEW CAPABILITIES

INTO SILICON AND PRODUCING NEW PRODUCTS AND PLATFORMS OPTIMIZED

FOR A WIDER VARIETY OF APPLICATIONS. IN 2007, WE STARTED

MANUFACTURING MICROPROCESSORS ON OUR NEW 45NM

HI-K

METAL

GATE SILICON TECHNOLOGY, AND WE EXPECT TO INTRODUCE A NEW

MICROARCHITECTURE ON 45NM PROCESS TECHNOLOGY IN 2008. WE ARE

CURRENTLY DEVELOPING 32NM PROCESS TECHNOLOGY, OUR

NEXT-GENERATION PROCESS TECHNOLOGY, AND EXPECT TO BEGIN

MANUFACTURING PRODUCTS USING THAT TECHNOLOGY IN 2009.

OUR R&D MODEL IS BASED ON A GLOBAL ORGANIZATION THAT

EMPHASIZES A COLLABORATIVE APPROACH IN IDENTIFYING AND

DEVELOPING NEW TECHNOLOGIES, LEADING STANDARDS INITIATIVES, AND

INFLUENCING REGULATORY POLICY TO ACCELERATE THE ADOPTION OF NEW

TECHNOLOGIES. OUR R&D INITIATIVES ARE PERFORMED BY VARIOUS

BUSINESS GROUPS WITHIN THE COMPANY, AND WE CENTRALLY MANAGE KEY

CROSS-BUSINESS GROUP PRODUCT INITIATIVES TO ALIGN AND PRIORITIZE

OUR R&D ACTIVITIES ACROSS THESE GROUPS. IN ADDITION, WE MAY

AUGMENT OUR R&D INITIATIVES BY INVESTING IN COMPANIES OR

ENTERING INTO AGREEMENTS WITH COMPANIES THAT HAVE SIMILAR

R&D FOCUS AREAS. FOR EXAMPLE, WE HAVE AN AGREEMENT WITH

MICRON FOR JOINT DEVELOPMENT OF NAND FLASH MEMORY TECHNOLOGIES.

WE ALSO WORK WITH A WORLDWIDE NETWORK OF ACADEMIC, GOVERNMENT,

AND INDUSTRY RESEARCHERS, SCIENTISTS, AND ENGINEERS IN THE

COMPUTING AND COMMUNICATIONS FIELDS. OUR NETWORK OF TECHNOLOGY

PROFESSIONALS ALLOWS US, AS WELL AS OTHERS IN OUR INDUSTRY, TO

BENEFIT FROM DEVELOPMENT INITIATIVES IN A VARIETY OF AREAS,

EVENTUALLY LEADING TO INNOVATIVE TECHNOLOGIES FOR USERS. WE

BELIEVE THAT WE ARE WELL POSITIONED IN THE TECHNOLOGY INDUSTRY

TO HELP DRIVE INNOVATION, FOSTER COLLABORATION, AND PROMOTE

INDUSTRY STANDARDS THAT WILL YIELD INNOVATIVE AND IMPROVED

TECHNOLOGIES FOR USERS.

SALES

ARRANGEMENTS

OUR PRODUCTS ARE SOLD OR LICENSED THROUGH SALES OFFICES

THROUGHOUT THE WORLD. SALES OF OUR PRODUCTS ARE TYPICALLY MADE

VIA PURCHASE ORDERS THAT CONTAIN STANDARD TERMS AND CONDITIONS

COVERING MATTERS SUCH AS PRICING, PAYMENT TERMS, AND WARRANTIES,

AS WELL AS INDEMNITIES FOR ISSUES SPECIFIC TO OUR PRODUCTS, SUCH

AS PATENT AND COPYRIGHT INDEMNITIES. FROM TIME TO TIME, WE MAY

ENTER INTO ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS WITH CUSTOMERS COVERING, FOR

EXAMPLE, CHANGES FROM OUR STANDARD TERMS AND CONDITIONS, NEW

PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT AND MARKETING, PRIVATE-LABEL BRANDING, AND

OTHER MATTERS. MOST OF OUR SALES ARE MADE USING ELECTRONIC AND

WEB-BASED PROCESSES THAT ALLOW THE CUSTOMER TO REVIEW INVENTORY

AVAILABILITY AND TRACK THE PROGRESS OF SPECIFIC GOODS ORDERED.

PRICING ON PARTICULAR PRODUCTS MAY VARY BASED ON VOLUMES ORDERED

AND OTHER FACTORS. WE ALSO OFFER DISCOUNTS, REBATES, AND OTHER

INCENTIVES TO CUSTOMERS TO INCREASE ACCEPTANCE OF OUR PRODUCTS

AND TECHNOLOGY.

OUR PRODUCTS ARE TYPICALLY SHIPPED UNDER TERMS THAT TRANSFER

TITLE TO THE CUSTOMER, EVEN IN ARRANGEMENTS FOR WHICH THE

RECOGNITION OF REVENUE ON THE SALE IS DEFERRED. OUR STANDARD

TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF SALE TYPICALLY PROVIDE THAT PAYMENT IS

DUE AT A LATER DATE, GENERALLY 30 DAYS AFTER SHIPMENT,

DELIVERY, OR THE CUSTOMERS USE OF THE PRODUCT. OUR CREDIT

DEPARTMENT SETS ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND SHIPPING LIMITS FOR

INDIVIDUAL CUSTOMERS TO CONTROL CREDIT RISK TO INTEL ARISING

FROM OUTSTANDING ACCOUNT BALANCES. WE ASSESS CREDIT RISK THROUGH

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE ANALYSIS, AND FROM THIS ANALYSIS,

WE ESTABLISH CREDIT LIMITS AND DETERMINE WHETHER WE WILL SEEK TO

USE ONE OR MORE CREDIT SUPPORT DEVICES, SUCH AS OBTAINING SOME

FORM OF THIRD-PARTY GUARANTY OR STANDBY LETTER OF CREDIT, OR

OBTAINING CREDIT INSURANCE FOR ALL OR A PORTION OF THE ACCOUNT

BALANCE IF NECESSARY. CREDIT LOSSES MAY STILL BE INCURRED DUE TO

BANKRUPTCY, FRAUD, OR OTHER FAILURE OF THE CUSTOMER TO PAY. SEE

SCHEDULE IIVALUATION AND QUALIFYING

ACCOUNTS IN PART IV OF THIS

FORM 10-K

FOR INFORMATION ABOUT OUR ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL RECEIVABLES.

DISTRIBUTION

TYPICALLY, DISTRIBUTORS HANDLE A WIDE VARIETY OF PRODUCTS,

INCLUDING THOSE THAT COMPETE WITH OUR PRODUCTS, AND FILL ORDERS

FOR MANY CUSTOMERS. MOST OF OUR SALES TO DISTRIBUTORS ARE MADE

UNDER AGREEMENTS ALLOWING FOR PRICE PROTECTION ON UNSOLD

MERCHANDISE AND A RIGHT OF RETURN ON STIPULATED QUANTITIES OF

UNSOLD MERCHANDISE. WE ALSO UTILIZE THIRD-PARTY SALES

REPRESENTATIVES WHO GENERALLY DO NOT OFFER DIRECTLY COMPETITIVE

PRODUCTS BUT MAY CARRY COMPLEMENTARY ITEMS MANUFACTURED BY

OTHERS. SALES REPRESENTATIVES DO NOT MAINTAIN A PRODUCT

INVENTORY; INSTEAD, THEIR CUSTOMERS PLACE ORDERS DIRECTLY WITH

US OR THROUGH DISTRIBUTORS.

BACKLOG

WE DO NOT BELIEVE THAT BACKLOG AS OF ANY PARTICULAR DATE IS

MEANINGFUL, AS OUR SALES ARE MADE PRIMARILY PURSUANT TO STANDARD

PURCHASE ORDERS FOR DELIVERY OF PRODUCTS. ONLY A SMALL PORTION

OF OUR ORDERS IS NON-CANCELABLE, AND THE DOLLAR AMOUNT

ASSOCIATED WITH THE NON-CANCELABLE PORTION IS NOT SIGNIFICANT.

SEASONAL

TRENDS

OUR MICROPROCESSOR SALES GENERALLY HAVE FOLLOWED A SEASONAL

TREND; HOWEVER, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THIS TREND WILL

CONTINUE. HISTORICALLY, OUR SALES OF MICROPROCESSORS HAVE BEEN

HIGHER IN THE SECOND HALF OF THE YEAR THAN IN THE FIRST HALF OF

THE YEAR. CONSUMER PURCHASES OF PCS HAVE BEEN HIGHER IN THE

SECOND HALF OF THE YEAR, PRIMARILY DUE TO BACK-TO-SCHOOL AND

HOLIDAY DEMAND. IN ADDITION, PURCHASES FROM BUSINESSES HAVE

TENDED TO BE HIGHER IN THE SECOND HALF OF THE YEAR.

GENERATE DEMAND THROUGH OUR OWN DIRECT MARKETING AS WELL AS

CO-MARKETING PROGRAMS. OUR DIRECT MARKETING ACTIVITIES INCLUDE

TELEVISION, PRINT AND WEB-BASED ADVERTISING, AS WELL AS PRESS

RELATIONS, CONSUMER AND TRADE EVENTS, AND INDUSTRY AND CONSUMER

COMMUNICATIONS. WE MARKET TO CONSUMER AND BUSINESS AUDIENCES AND

FOCUS ON BUILDING AWARENESS AND GENERATING DEMAND FOR INCREASED

PERFORMANCE, POWER EFFICIENCY, AND NEW CAPABILITIES.

PURCHASES BY CUSTOMERS OFTEN ALLOW THEM TO PARTICIPATE IN

COOPERATIVE ADVERTISING AND MARKETING PROGRAMS SUCH AS THE INTEL

ON WEB-BASED MARKETING. WE HAVE ALSO ENTERED INTO JOINT

MARKETING ARRANGEMENTS WITH CERTAIN CUSTOMERS.

COMPETITION

OUR PRODUCTS COMPETE PRIMARILY BASED ON PERFORMANCE, FEATURES,

PRICE, QUALITY, BRAND RECOGNITION, AND AVAILABILITY. OUR ABILITY

TO COMPETE DEPENDS ON OUR ABILITY TO PROVIDE INNOVATIVE PRODUCTS

AND WORLDWIDE SUPPORT FOR OUR CUSTOMERS AT COMPETITIVE PRICES,

INCLUDING PROVIDING IMPROVED ENERGY-EFFICIENT PERFORMANCE,

ENHANCED SECURITY, MANAGEABILITY, AND INTEGRATED SOLUTIONS. IN

ADDITION TO OUR VARIOUS COMPUTING, NETWORKING, AND

COMMUNICATIONS PRODUCTS, WE OFFER PLATFORMS THAT INCORPORATE

VARIOUS COMPONENTS DESIGNED AND CONFIGURED TO WORK TOGETHER TO

PROVIDE AN OPTIMIZED USER COMPUTING SOLUTION COMPARED TO

INGREDIENTS THAT ARE USED SEPARATELY.

THE SEMICONDUCTOR INDUSTRY IS CHARACTERIZED BY RAPID ADVANCES IN

TECHNOLOGY AND NEW PRODUCT INTRODUCTIONS. AS UNIT VOLUMES OF A

PARTICULAR PRODUCT GROW, PRODUCTION EXPERIENCE IS ACCUMULATED

AND COSTS TYPICALLY DECREASE, FURTHER COMPETITION DEVELOPS, AND

AS A RESULT, PRICES DECLINE. THE LIFE CYCLE OF OUR PRODUCTS IS

VERY SHORT, SOMETIMES LESS THAN A YEAR. OUR ABILITY TO COMPETE

DEPENDS ON OUR ABILITY TO IMPROVE OUR PRODUCTS AND PROCESSES

FASTER THAN OUR COMPETITORS, ANTICIPATE CHANGING CUSTOMER

REQUIREMENTS, AND DEVELOP AND LAUNCH NEW PRODUCTS AND PLATFORMS,

WHILE REDUCING OUR AVERAGE

PER-UNIT

COSTS. SEE RISK FACTORS IN PART I, ITEM 1A

OF THIS

MANY COMPANIES COMPETE WITH US IN THE VARIOUS COMPUTING,

NETWORKING, AND COMMUNICATIONS MARKET SEGMENTS, AND ARE ENGAGED

IN THE SAME BASIC BUSINESS ACTIVITIES, INCLUDING R&D.

WORLDWIDE, THESE COMPETITORS RANGE IN SIZE FROM LARGE

ESTABLISHED MULTINATIONAL COMPANIES WITH MULTIPLE PRODUCT LINES

TO SMALLER COMPANIES AND NEW ENTRANTS TO THE MARKETPLACE THAT

COMPETE IN SPECIALIZED MARKET SEGMENTS. SOME OF OUR COMPETITORS

MAY HAVE DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENTS WITH OTHER COMPANIES, AND IN

SOME CASES OUR COMPETITORS MAY ALSO BE OUR CUSTOMERS AND/OR

SUPPLIERS. PRODUCT OFFERINGS MAY CROSS OVER INTO MULTIPLE

PRODUCT CATEGORIES, OFFERING US NEW OPPORTUNITIES BUT ALSO

RESULTING IN MORE COMPETITION. IT MAY BE DIFFICULT FOR US TO

COMPETE IN MARKET SEGMENTS WHERE OUR COMPETITORS HAVE

ESTABLISHED PRODUCTS AND BRAND RECOGNITION.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

WE BELIEVE THAT OUR NETWORK OF MANUFACTURING FACILITIES AND

ASSEMBLY AND TEST FACILITIES GIVES US A COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE.

THIS NETWORK ENABLES US TO HAVE MORE DIRECT CONTROL OVER OUR

PROCESSES, QUALITY CONTROL, PRODUCT COST, VOLUME, TIMING OF

PRODUCTION, AND OTHER FACTORS. THESE FACILITIES REQUIRE

SIGNIFICANT UP-FRONT CAPITAL SPENDING, AND MANY OF OUR

COMPETITORS DO NOT OWN SUCH FACILITIES BECAUSE THEY MAY NOT BE

ABLE TO AFFORD TO DO SO OR BECAUSE THEIR BUSINESS MODELS INVOLVE

THE USE OF THIRD-PARTY FACILITIES FOR MANUFACTURING AND ASSEMBLY

AND TEST. THESE FABLESS SEMICONDUCTOR COMPANIES

INCLUDE BROADCOM CORPORATION, NVIDIA CORPORATION, QUALCOMM

INCORPORATED, AND VIA TECHNOLOGIES, INC. (VIA). SOME OF OUR

COMPETITORS OWN PORTIONS OF SUCH FACILITIES THROUGH INVESTMENT

OR JOINT-VENTURE ARRANGEMENTS WITH OTHER COMPANIES. A GROUP OF

FOUNDRIES AND ASSEMBLY AND TEST SUBCONTRACTORS OFFER THEIR

SERVICES TO COMPANIES THAT DO NOT OWN FACILITIES OR TO COMPANIES

NEEDING ADDITIONAL CAPACITY. THESE FOUNDRIES AND SUBCONTRACTORS

MAY ALSO OFFER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, DESIGN SERVICES, AND OTHER

GOODS AND SERVICES TO OUR COMPETITORS. COMPETITORS WHO OUTSOURCE

THEIR MANUFACTURING AND ASSEMBLY AND TEST OPERATIONS CAN

SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE THEIR CAPITAL EXPENDITURES.

WE PLAN TO CONTINUE TO CULTIVATE NEW BUSINESSES AND WORK WITH

THE COMPUTING AND COMMUNICATIONS INDUSTRIES THROUGH STANDARDS

BODIES, TRADE ASSOCIATIONS, OEMS, ODMS, AND INDEPENDENT SOFTWARE

AND OPERATING SYSTEM VENDORS TO HELP ALIGN THE INDUSTRY TO OFFER

PRODUCTS THAT TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE LATEST MARKET TRENDS AND

USAGE MODELS. WE FREQUENTLY PARTICIPATE IN INDUSTRY INITIATIVES

DESIGNED TO DISCUSS AND AGREE UPON TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS AND

OTHER ASPECTS OF TECHNOLOGIES THAT COULD BE ADOPTED AS STANDARDS

BY STANDARDS-SETTING ORGANIZATIONS. OUR COMPETITORS MAY ALSO

PARTICIPATE IN THE SAME INITIATIVES AND SPECIFICATION

DEVELOPMENT. OUR PARTICIPATION DOES NOT ENSURE THAT ANY

STANDARDS OR SPECIFICATIONS ADOPTED BY THESE ORGANIZATIONS WILL

BE CONSISTENT WITH OUR PRODUCT PLANNING.

MICROPROCESSORS

WE CONTINUE TO BE LARGELY DEPENDENT ON THE SUCCESS OF OUR

MICROPROCESSOR BUSINESS. OUR ABILITY TO COMPETE DEPENDS ON OUR

ABILITY TO DELIVER NEW MICROPROCESSOR PRODUCTS WITH IMPROVED

OVERALL PERFORMANCE AND/OR IMPROVED ENERGY-EFFICIENT PERFORMANCE

AT COMPETITIVE PRICES. SOME OF OUR MICROPROCESSOR COMPETITORS,

SUCH AS ADVANCED MICRO DEVICES, INC. (AMD), MARKET

SOFTWARE-COMPATIBLE PRODUCTS THAT COMPETE WITH OUR PROCESSORS.

WE ALSO FACE COMPETITION FROM COMPANIES OFFERING RIVAL

ARCHITECTURE DESIGNS, SUCH AS CELL BROADBAND ENGINE ARCHITECTURE

OTHER COUNTRIES.

WE BELIEVE THAT THE DURATION OF THE APPLICABLE PATENTS THAT WE

ARE GRANTED IS ADEQUATE RELATIVE TO THE EXPECTED LIVES OF OUR

PRODUCTS. BECAUSE OF THE FAST PACE OF INNOVATION AND PRODUCT

DEVELOPMENT, OUR PRODUCTS ARE OFTEN OBSOLETE BEFORE THE PATENTS

RELATED TO THEM EXPIRE, AND SOMETIMES ARE OBSOLETE BEFORE THE

PATENTS RELATED TO THEM ARE EVEN GRANTED. AS WE EXPAND OUR

PRODUCT OFFERINGS INTO NEW INDUSTRIES, WE ALSO SEEK TO EXTEND

OUR PATENT DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS TO PATENT SUCH PRODUCT OFFERINGS.

ESTABLISHED COMPETITORS IN EXISTING AND NEW INDUSTRIES, AS WELL

AS COMPANIES THAT PURCHASE AND ENFORCE PATENTS AND OTHER

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, MAY ALREADY HAVE PATENTS COVERING SIMILAR

PRODUCTS. THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO OBTAIN

PATENTS COVERING OUR OWN PRODUCTS, OR THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO

OBTAIN LICENSES FROM SUCH COMPANIES ON FAVORABLE TERMS OR AT ALL.

THE MAJORITY OF THE SOFTWARE THAT WE DISTRIBUTE, INCLUDING

SOFTWARE EMBEDDED IN OUR COMPONENT- AND SYSTEM-LEVEL PRODUCTS,

IS ENTITLED TO COPYRIGHT PROTECTION.

TO DISTINGUISH INTEL PRODUCTS FROM OUR COMPETITORS

PRODUCTS, WE HAVE OBTAINED CERTAIN TRADEMARKS AND TRADE NAMES

FOR OUR PRODUCTS, AND WE MAINTAIN COOPERATIVE ADVERTISING

PROGRAMS WITH CERTAIN CUSTOMERS TO PROMOTE OUR BRANDS AND TO

IDENTIFY PRODUCTS CONTAINING GENUINE INTEL COMPONENTS.

WE ALSO PROTECT CERTAIN DETAILS ABOUT OUR PROCESSES, PRODUCTS,

AND STRATEGIES AS TRADE SECRETS, KEEPING CONFIDENTIAL THE

INFORMATION THAT WE BELIEVE PROVIDES US WITH A COMPETITIVE

ADVANTAGE. WE HAVE ONGOING PROGRAMS DESIGNED TO MAINTAIN THE

CONFIDENTIALITY OF SUCH INFORMATION.

COMPLIANCE

WITH ENVIRONMENTAL, HEALTH, AND SAFETY REGULATIONS

WE ARE COMMITTED TO ACHIEVING HIGH STANDARDS OF ENVIRONMENTAL

QUALITY AND PRODUCT SAFETY, AND WE STRIVE TO PROVIDE A SAFE AND

HEALTHY WORKPLACE FOR OUR EMPLOYEES, CONTRACTORS, AND THE

COMMUNITIES IN WHICH WE DO BUSINESS. WE HAVE ENVIRONMENTAL,

HEALTH, AND SAFETY (EHS) POLICIES AND EXPECTATIONS THAT APPLY TO

OUR GLOBAL OPERATIONS. EACH OF OUR WORLDWIDE PRODUCTION

FACILITIES IS IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATION

FOR STANDARDIZATION (ISO) 14001 ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

STANDARD. OUR INTERNAL EHS AUDITING PROGRAM ADDRESSES NOT ONLY

COMPLIANCE BUT ALSO BUSINESS RISK AND MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS. WE

FOCUS ON MINIMIZING AND PROPERLY MANAGING THE HAZARDOUS

MATERIALS USED IN OUR FACILITIES AND PRODUCTS. WE MONITOR

REGULATORY AND RESOURCE TRENDS AND SET COMPANY-WIDE SHORT- AND

LONG-TERM PERFORMANCE TARGETS FOR KEY RESOURCES AND EMISSIONS.

THESE TARGETS ADDRESS SEVERAL PARAMETERS, INCLUDING ENERGY AND

WATER USE, CLIMATE CHANGE, WASTE RECYCLING, AND EMISSIONS. FOR

EXAMPLE, WE CONTINUE TO TAKE ACTION TO ACHIEVE OUR GLOBAL

GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION GOAL BY INVESTING IN ENERGY

CONSERVATION PROJECTS IN OUR FACTORIES AND WORKING WITH

SUPPLIERS OF MANUFACTURING TOOLS TO IMPROVE ENERGY EFFICIENCY.

WE ALSO FOCUS ON DEVELOPING INNOVATIVE SOLUTIONS TO IMPROVE THE

ENERGY EFFICIENCY OF OUR PRODUCTS AND THOSE OF OUR CUSTOMERS. WE

TAKE A HOLISTIC APPROACH TO POWER MANAGEMENT, ADDRESSING THE

CHALLENGE AT ALL LEVELS, INCLUDING THE SILICON, PACKAGE,

CIRCUIT,

MICRO/MACRO

ARCHITECTURE, PLATFORM, AND SOFTWARE LEVELS.

THE PRODUCTION OF OUR PRODUCTS REQUIRES THE USE OF HAZARDOUS

MATERIALS THAT ARE SUBJECT TO A BROAD ARRAY OF EHS LAWS AND

REGULATIONS. WE ACTIVELY MONITOR THE MATERIALS USED IN THE

PRODUCTION OF OUR PRODUCTS. WE HAVE SPECIFIC RESTRICTIONS ON THE

CONTENT OF CERTAIN HAZARDOUS MATERIALS IN OUR PRODUCTS, AS WELL

AS THOSE OF OUR SUPPLIERS AND OUTSOURCED MANUFACTURERS AND

SUBCONTRACTORS. WE CONTINUE TO MAKE EFFORTS TO REDUCE HAZARDOUS

MATERIALS IN OUR PRODUCTS TO POSITION US TO MEET VARIOUS

ENVIRONMENTAL RESTRICTIONS ON PRODUCT CONTENT THROUGHOUT THE

WORLD. FOR EXAMPLE, PROCESSORS MANUFACTURED USING OUR NEW 45NM

HI-K METAL GATE SILICON TECHNOLOGY ARE MANUFACTURED USING A

LEAD-FREE PROCESS. AS WE CONTINUE TO ADVANCE PROCESS TECHNOLOGY,

THE MATERIALS, TECHNOLOGIES, AND PRODUCTS THEMSELVES BECOME

INCREASINGLY COMPLEX. OUR EVALUATIONS OF MATERIALS FOR USE IN

R&D AND PRODUCTION TAKE INTO ACCOUNT EHS CONSIDERATIONS.

COMPLIANCE WITH THESE COMPLEX LAWS AND REGULATIONS, AS WELL AS

INTERNAL VOLUNTARY PROGRAMS, IS INTEGRATED INTO OUR DESIGN

FOR EHS PROGRAMS.

WE ARE COMMITTED TO PROTECTING THE ENVIRONMENT AND HUMAN RIGHTS

THROUGHOUT OUR SUPPLY CHAIN. WE EXPECT SUPPLIERS AND

SUBCONTRACTORS TO UNDERSTAND AND FULLY COMPLY WITH ALL EHS AND

RELATED LAWS AND REGULATIONS AND LABOR LAWS, INCLUDING, AT A

MINIMUM, THOSE COVERING NON-DISCRIMINATION IN THE TERMS AND

CONDITIONS OF EMPLOYMENT, CHILD LABOR, MINIMUM WAGES, EMPLOYEE

BENEFITS, AND WORK HOURS. IN ADDITION, WE EXPECT SUPPLIERS TO

ABIDE BY OUR POLICIES, SUCH AS OUR CODE OF CONDUCT AND THE

ELECTRONIC INDUSTRY CODE OF CONDUCT.

ITEM 1A.  RISK

FACTORS

FLUCTUATIONS

IN DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS MAY HARM OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS AND

ARE DIFFICULT TO FORECAST.

IF DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS FLUCTUATES, OUR REVENUE AND GROSS

MARGIN COULD BE HARMED. IMPORTANT FACTORS THAT COULD CAUSE

DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS TO FLUCTUATE INCLUDE.



CHANGES IN BUSINESS AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, INCLUDING A

DOWNTURN IN THE SEMICONDUCTOR INDUSTRY AND/OR THE OVERALL

ECONOMY;



CHANGES IN CONSUMER CONFIDENCE CAUSED BY CHANGES IN MARKET

CONDITIONS, INCLUDING CHANGES IN THE CREDIT MARKET;



COMPETITIVE PRESSURES, INCLUDING PRICING PRESSURES, FROM

COMPANIES THAT HAVE COMPETING PRODUCTS, CHIP ARCHITECTURES,

MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGIES, AND MARKETING PROGRAMS;



CHANGES IN CUSTOMER PRODUCT NEEDS;



CHANGES IN THE LEVEL OF CUSTOMERS COMPONENTS INVENTORY;



STRATEGIC ACTIONS TAKEN BY OUR COMPETITORS; AND



MARKET ACCEPTANCE OF OUR PRODUCTS.

IF PRODUCT DEMAND DECREASES, OUR MANUFACTURING OR ASSEMBLY AND

TEST CAPACITY COULD BE UNDERUTILIZED, AND WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO

RECORD AN IMPAIRMENT ON OUR LONG-LIVED ASSETS INCLUDING

FACILITIES AND EQUIPMENT, AS WELL AS INTANGIBLE ASSETS, WHICH

WOULD INCREASE OUR EXPENSES. IN ADDITION, FACTORY-PLANNING

DECISIONS MAY SHORTEN THE USEFUL LIVES OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS,

INCLUDING FACILITIES AND EQUIPMENT, AND CAUSE US TO ACCELERATE

DEPRECIATION. IN THE LONG TERM, IF PRODUCT DEMAND INCREASES, WE

MAY NOT BE ABLE TO ADD MANUFACTURING OR ASSEMBLY AND TEST

CAPACITY FAST ENOUGH TO MEET MARKET DEMAND. THESE CHANGES IN

DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS, AND CHANGES IN OUR CUSTOMERS

PRODUCT NEEDS, COULD HAVE A VARIETY OF NEGATIVE EFFECTS ON OUR

COMPETITIVE POSITION AND OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS, AND, IN CERTAIN

CASES, MAY REDUCE OUR REVENUE, INCREASE OUR COSTS, LOWER OUR

GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE, OR REQUIRE US TO RECOGNIZE IMPAIRMENTS

OF OUR ASSETS. IN ADDITION, IF PRODUCT DEMAND DECREASES OR WE

FAIL TO FORECAST DEMAND ACCURATELY, WE COULD BE REQUIRED TO

WRITE OFF INVENTORY OR RECORD UNDERUTILIZATION CHARGES, WHICH

WOULD HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON OUR GROSS MARGIN.

THE

SEMICONDUCTOR INDUSTRY AND OUR OPERATIONS ARE CHARACTERIZED BY A

HIGH PERCENTAGE OF COSTS THAT ARE FIXED OR DIFFICULT TO REDUCE

IN THE SHORT TERM, AND BY PRODUCT DEMAND THAT IS HIGHLY VARIABLE

AND SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT DOWNTURNS THAT MAY HARM OUR BUSINESS,

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

THE SEMICONDUCTOR INDUSTRY AND OUR OPERATIONS ARE CHARACTERIZED

BY HIGH COSTS, SUCH AS THOSE RELATED TO FACILITY CONSTRUCTION

AND EQUIPMENT, R&D, AND EMPLOYMENT AND TRAINING OF A HIGHLY

SKILLED WORKFORCE, THAT ARE EITHER FIXED OR DIFFICULT TO REDUCE

IN THE SHORT TERM. AT THE SAME TIME, DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS IS

HIGHLY VARIABLE AND THERE HAVE BEEN DOWNTURNS, OFTEN IN

CONNECTION WITH MATURING PRODUCT CYCLES AS WELL AS DOWNTURNS IN

GENERAL ECONOMIC MARKET CONDITIONS. THESE DOWNTURNS HAVE BEEN

CHARACTERIZED BY REDUCED PRODUCT DEMAND, MANUFACTURING

OVERCAPACITY, HIGH INVENTORY LEVELS, AND LOWER AVERAGE SELLING

PRICES. THE COMBINATION OF THESE FACTORS MAY CAUSE OUR REVENUE,

GROSS MARGIN, CASH FLOW, AND PROFITABILITY TO VARY SIGNIFICANTLY

IN BOTH THE SHORT AND LONG TERM.

WE

OPERATE IN INTENSELY COMPETITIVE INDUSTRIES, AND OUR FAILURE TO

RESPOND QUICKLY TO TECHNOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENTS AND INCORPORATE

NEW FEATURES INTO OUR PRODUCTS COULD HARM OUR ABILITY TO

COMPETE.

WE OPERATE IN INTENSELY COMPETITIVE INDUSTRIES THAT EXPERIENCE

RAPID TECHNOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENTS, CHANGES IN INDUSTRY STANDARDS,

CHANGES IN CUSTOMER REQUIREMENTS, AND FREQUENT NEW PRODUCT

INTRODUCTIONS AND IMPROVEMENTS. IF WE ARE UNABLE TO RESPOND

QUICKLY AND SUCCESSFULLY TO THESE DEVELOPMENTS, WE MAY LOSE OUR

COMPETITIVE POSITION, AND OUR PRODUCTS OR TECHNOLOGIES MAY

BECOME UNCOMPETITIVE OR OBSOLETE. TO COMPETE SUCCESSFULLY, WE

MUST MAINTAIN A SUCCESSFUL R&D EFFORT, DEVELOP NEW PRODUCTS

AND PRODUCTION PROCESSES, AND IMPROVE OUR EXISTING PRODUCTS AND

PROCESSES AT THE SAME PACE OR AHEAD OF OUR COMPETITORS. WE MAY

NOT BE ABLE TO DEVELOP AND MARKET THESE NEW PRODUCTS

SUCCESSFULLY, THE PRODUCTS WE INVEST IN AND DEVELOP MAY NOT BE

WELL RECEIVED BY CUSTOMERS, AND PRODUCTS DEVELOPED AND NEW

TECHNOLOGIES OFFERED BY OTHERS MAY AFFECT DEMAND FOR OUR

PRODUCTS. THESE TYPES OF EVENTS COULD HAVE A VARIETY OF NEGATIVE

EFFECTS ON OUR COMPETITIVE POSITION AND OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS,

SUCH AS REDUCING OUR REVENUE, INCREASING OUR COSTS, LOWERING OUR

GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE, AND REQUIRING US TO RECOGNIZE

IMPAIRMENTS OF OUR ASSETS.

FLUCTUATIONS

IN THE MIX OF PRODUCTS SOLD MAY HARM OUR FINANCIAL

RESULTS.

BECAUSE OF THE WIDE PRICE DIFFERENCES AMONG MOBILE, DESKTOP, AND

SERVER MICROPROCESSORS, THE MIX AND TYPES OF PERFORMANCE

CAPABILITIES OF MICROPROCESSORS SOLD AFFECT THE AVERAGE SELLING

PRICE OF OUR PRODUCTS AND HAVE A SUBSTANTIAL IMPACT ON OUR

REVENUE AND GROSS MARGIN. OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS ALSO DEPEND IN

PART ON THE MIX OF OTHER PRODUCTS THAT WE SELL, SUCH AS

CHIPSETS, FLASH MEMORY, AND OTHER SEMICONDUCTOR PRODUCTS. IN

ADDITION, MORE RECENTLY INTRODUCED PRODUCTS TEND TO HAVE HIGHER

ASSOCIATED COSTS BECAUSE OF INITIAL OVERALL DEVELOPMENT AND

PRODUCTION RAMP. FLUCTUATIONS IN THE MIX AND TYPES OF OUR

PRODUCTS MAY ALSO AFFECT THE EXTENT TO WHICH WE ARE ABLE TO

RECOVER THE FIXED COSTS AND INVESTMENTS ASSOCIATED WITH A

PARTICULAR PRODUCT, AND AS A RESULT CAN HARM OUR FINANCIAL

RESULTS.

15

TABLE OF CONTENTS

OUR

GLOBAL OPERATIONS SUBJECT US TO RISKS THAT MAY HARM OUR RESULTS

OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

WE HAVE SALES OFFICES, R&D, MANUFACTURING, AND ASSEMBLY AND

TEST FACILITIES IN MANY COUNTRIES, AND AS A RESULT, WE ARE

SUBJECT TO RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH DOING BUSINESS GLOBALLY. OUR

GLOBAL OPERATIONS MAY BE SUBJECT TO RISKS THAT MAY LIMIT OUR

ABILITY TO MANUFACTURE, ASSEMBLE AND TEST, DESIGN, DEVELOP, OR

SELL PRODUCTS IN PARTICULAR COUNTRIES, WHICH COULD, IN TURN,

HARM OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION,

INCLUDING.



SECURITY CONCERNS, SUCH AS ARMED CONFLICT AND CIVIL OR MILITARY

UNREST, CRIME, POLITICAL INSTABILITY, AND TERRORIST ACTIVITY;



HEALTH CONCERNS;



NATURAL DISASTERS;



INEFFICIENT AND LIMITED INFRASTRUCTURE AND DISRUPTIONS, SUCH AS

LARGE-SCALE OUTAGES OR INTERRUPTIONS OF SERVICE FROM UTILITIES

OR TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROVIDERS AND SUPPLY CHAIN INTERRUPTIONS;



DIFFERING EMPLOYMENT PRACTICES AND LABOR ISSUES;



LOCAL BUSINESS AND CULTURAL FACTORS THAT DIFFER FROM OUR NORMAL

STANDARDS AND PRACTICES;



REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS AND PROHIBITIONS THAT DIFFER BETWEEN

JURISDICTIONS; AND



RESTRICTIONS ON OUR OPERATIONS BY GOVERNMENTS SEEKING TO SUPPORT

LOCAL INDUSTRIES, NATIONALIZATION OF OUR OPERATIONS, AND

RESTRICTIONS ON OUR ABILITY TO REPATRIATE EARNINGS.

IN ADDITION, ALTHOUGH MOST OF OUR PRODUCTS ARE PRICED AND PAID

FOR IN U.S. DOLLARS, A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF CERTAIN TYPES OF

EXPENSES, SUCH AS PAYROLL, UTILITIES, TAX, AND MARKETING

EXPENSES, ARE PAID IN LOCAL CURRENCIES. OUR HEDGING PROGRAMS

REDUCE, BUT DO NOT ENTIRELY ELIMINATE, THE IMPACT OF CURRENCY

EXCHANGE RATE MOVEMENTS, AND THEREFORE FLUCTUATIONS IN EXCHANGE

RATES COULD HARM OUR BUSINESS OPERATING RESULTS AND FINANCIAL

CONDITION. IN ADDITION, CHANGES IN TARIFF AND IMPORT REGULATIONS

AND TO U.S. AND

NON-U.S.

MONETARY POLICIES MAY HARM OUR OPERATING RESULTS AND FINANCIAL

CONDITION BY INCREASING OUR EXPENSES AND REDUCING OUR REVENUE.

VARYING TAX RATES IN DIFFERENT JURISDICTIONS COULD HARM OUR

OPERATING RESULTS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION BY INCREASING OUR

OVERALL TAX RATE.

WE ALSO MAINTAIN A PROGRAM OF INSURANCE COVERAGE FOR VARIOUS

TYPES OF PROPERTY, CASUALTY, AND OTHER RISKS. WE PLACE OUR

INSURANCE COVERAGE WITH VARIOUS CARRIERS IN NUMEROUS

JURISDICTIONS. THE TYPES AND AMOUNTS OF INSURANCE THAT WE OBTAIN

VARY FROM TIME TO TIME AND FROM LOCATION TO LOCATION, DEPENDING

ON AVAILABILITY, COST, AND OUR DECISIONS WITH RESPECT TO RISK

RETENTION. THE POLICIES ARE SUBJECT TO DEDUCTIBLES AND

EXCLUSIONS THAT RESULT IN OUR RETENTION OF A LEVEL OF RISK ON A

SELF-INSURANCE BASIS. LOSSES NOT COVERED BY INSURANCE MAY BE

SUBSTANTIAL AND MAY INCREASE OUR EXPENSES, WHICH COULD HARM OUR

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

FAILURE

TO MEET OUR PRODUCTION TARGETS, RESULTING IN UNDERSUPPLY OR

OVERSUPPLY OF PRODUCTS, MAY HARM OUR BUSINESS AND RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS.

PRODUCTION OF INTEGRATED CIRCUITS IS A COMPLEX PROCESS.

DISRUPTIONS IN THIS PROCESS CAN RESULT FROM INTERRUPTIONS IN OUR

PROCESSES, ERRORS, AND DIFFICULTIES IN OUR DEVELOPMENT AND

IMPLEMENTATION OF NEW PROCESSES; DEFECTS IN MATERIALS;

DISRUPTIONS IN OUR SUPPLY OF MATERIALS OR RESOURCES; AND

DISRUPTIONS AT OUR FABRICATION AND ASSEMBLY AND TEST FACILITIES

DUE TO, FOR EXAMPLE, ACCIDENTS, MAINTENANCE ISSUES, OR UNSAFE

WORKING CONDITIONSALL OF WHICH COULD AFFECT THE TIMING OF

PRODUCTION RAMPS AND YIELDS. WE MAY NOT BE SUCCESSFUL OR

EFFICIENT IN DEVELOPING OR IMPLEMENTING NEW PRODUCTION

PROCESSES. THE OCCURRENCE OF ANY OF THE FOREGOING MAY RESULT IN

OUR FAILURE TO MEET OR INCREASE PRODUCTION AS DESIRED, RESULTING

IN HIGHER COSTS OR SUBSTANTIAL DECREASES IN YIELDS, WHICH COULD

AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO PRODUCE SUFFICIENT VOLUME TO MEET SPECIFIC

PRODUCT DEMAND. THE UNAVAILABILITY OR REDUCED AVAILABILITY OF

CERTAIN PRODUCTS COULD MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT TO IMPLEMENT OUR

PLATFORM STRATEGY. WE MAY ALSO EXPERIENCE INCREASES IN YIELDS. A

SUBSTANTIAL INCREASE IN YIELDS COULD RESULT IN HIGHER INVENTORY

LEVELS AND THE POSSIBILITY OF RESULTING EXCESS CAPACITY CHARGES

AS WE SLOW PRODUCTION TO REDUCE INVENTORY LEVELS. THE OCCURRENCE

OF ANY OF THESE EVENTS COULD HARM OUR BUSINESS AND RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS.

WE MAY

HAVE DIFFICULTIES OBTAINING THE RESOURCES OR PRODUCTS WE NEED

FOR MANUFACTURING, ASSEMBLING AND TESTING OUR PRODUCTS, OR

OPERATING OTHER ASPECTS OF OUR BUSINESS, WHICH COULD HARM OUR

ABILITY TO MEET DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS AND MAY INCREASE OUR

COSTS.

WE HAVE THOUSANDS OF SUPPLIERS PROVIDING VARIOUS MATERIALS THAT

WE USE IN THE PRODUCTION OF OUR PRODUCTS AND OTHER ASPECTS OF

OUR BUSINESS, AND WE SEEK, WHERE POSSIBLE, TO HAVE SEVERAL

SOURCES OF SUPPLY FOR ALL OF THOSE MATERIALS. HOWEVER, WE MAY

RELY ON A SINGLE OR A LIMITED NUMBER OF SUPPLIERS, OR UPON

SUPPLIERS IN A SINGLE COUNTRY, FOR THESE MATERIALS. THE

INABILITY OF SUCH SUPPLIERS TO DELIVER ADEQUATE SUPPLIES OF

PRODUCTION MATERIALS OR OTHER SUPPLIES COULD DISRUPT OUR

PRODUCTION PROCESSES OR COULD MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR US TO

IMPLEMENT OUR BUSINESS STRATEGY. IN ADDITION, PRODUCTION COULD

BE DISRUPTED BY THE UNAVAILABILITY OF THE RESOURCES USED IN

PRODUCTION, SUCH AS WATER, SILICON, ELECTRICITY, AND GASES. THE

UNAVAILABILITY OR REDUCED AVAILABILITY OF THE MATERIALS OR

RESOURCES THAT WE USE IN OUR BUSINESS MAY REQUIRE US TO REDUCE

PRODUCTION OF PRODUCTS OR MAY REQUIRE US TO INCUR ADDITIONAL

COSTS IN ORDER TO OBTAIN AN ADEQUATE SUPPLY OF THOSE MATERIALS

OR RESOURCES. THE OCCURRENCE OF ANY OF THESE EVENTS COULD HARM

OUR BUSINESS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

16

TABLE OF CONTENTS

COSTS

RELATED TO PRODUCT DEFECTS AND ERRATA MAY HARM OUR RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS AND BUSINESS.

COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH UNEXPECTED PRODUCT DEFECTS AND ERRATA

(DEVIATIONS FROM PUBLISHED SPECIFICATIONS) DUE TO, FOR EXAMPLE,

UNANTICIPATED PROBLEMS IN OUR MANUFACTURING PROCESSES INCLUDE,

THE COSTS OF.



WRITING OFF THE VALUE OF INVENTORY OF DEFECTIVE PRODUCTS;



DISPOSING OF DEFECTIVE PRODUCTS THAT CANNOT BE FIXED;



RECALLING DEFECTIVE PRODUCTS THAT HAVE BEEN SHIPPED TO CUSTOMERS;



PROVIDING PRODUCT REPLACEMENTS FOR, OR MODIFICATIONS TO,

DEFECTIVE PRODUCTS; AND/OR



DEFENDING AGAINST LITIGATION RELATED TO DEFECTIVE PRODUCTS.

THESE COSTS COULD BE SUBSTANTIAL AND MAY THEREFORE INCREASE OUR

EXPENSES AND LOWER OUR GROSS MARGIN. IN ADDITION, OUR REPUTATION

WITH OUR CUSTOMERS OR USERS OF OUR PRODUCTS COULD BE DAMAGED AS

A RESULT OF SUCH PRODUCT DEFECTS AND ERRATA, AND THE DEMAND FOR

OUR PRODUCTS COULD BE REDUCED. THESE FACTORS COULD HARM OUR

FINANCIAL RESULTS AND THE PROSPECTS FOR OUR BUSINESS.

WE MAY

BE SUBJECT TO CLAIMS OF INFRINGEMENT OF THIRD-PARTY INTELLECTUAL

PROPERTY RIGHTS, WHICH COULD HARM OUR BUSINESS.

FROM TIME TO TIME, THIRD PARTIES MAY ASSERT AGAINST US OR OUR

CUSTOMERS ALLEGED PATENT, COPYRIGHT, TRADEMARK, OR OTHER

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS TO TECHNOLOGIES THAT ARE IMPORTANT

TO OUR BUSINESS. WE MAY BE SUBJECT TO INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

INFRINGEMENT CLAIMS FROM CERTAIN INDIVIDUALS AND COMPANIES WHO

HAVE ACQUIRED PATENT PORTFOLIOS FOR THE SOLE PURPOSE OF

ASSERTING SUCH CLAIMS AGAINST OTHER COMPANIES. ANY CLAIMS THAT

OUR PRODUCTS OR PROCESSES INFRINGE THE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

RIGHTS OF OTHERS, REGARDLESS OF THE MERIT OR RESOLUTION OF SUCH

CLAIMS, COULD CAUSE US TO INCUR SIGNIFICANT COSTS IN RESPONDING

TO, DEFENDING, AND RESOLVING SUCH CLAIMS, AND MAY DIVERT THE

EFFORTS AND ATTENTION OF OUR MANAGEMENT AND TECHNICAL PERSONNEL

AWAY FROM OUR BUSINESS. AS A RESULT OF SUCH INTELLECTUAL

PROPERTY INFRINGEMENT CLAIMS, WE COULD BE REQUIRED OR OTHERWISE

DECIDE IT IS APPROPRIATE TO.



PAY THIRD-PARTY INFRINGEMENT CLAIMS;



DISCONTINUE MANUFACTURING, USING, OR SELLING PARTICULAR PRODUCTS

SUBJECT TO INFRINGEMENT CLAIMS;



DISCONTINUE USING THE TECHNOLOGY OR PROCESSES SUBJECT TO

INFRINGEMENT CLAIMS;



DEVELOP OTHER TECHNOLOGY NOT SUBJECT TO INFRINGEMENT CLAIMS,

WHICH COULD BE TIME-CONSUMING AND COSTLY OR MAY NOT BE POSSIBLE;

AND/OR



LICENSE TECHNOLOGY FROM THE THIRD PARTY CLAIMING INFRINGEMENT,

WHICH LICENSE MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE ON COMMERCIALLY REASONABLE

TERMS.

THE OCCURRENCE OF ANY OF THE FOREGOING COULD RESULT IN

UNEXPECTED EXPENSES OR REQUIRE US TO RECOGNIZE AN IMPAIRMENT OF

OUR ASSETS, WHICH WOULD REDUCE THE VALUE OF OUR ASSETS AND

INCREASE EXPENSES. IN ADDITION, IF WE ALTER OR DISCONTINUE OUR

PRODUCTION OF AFFECTED ITEMS, OUR REVENUE COULD BE NEGATIVELY

IMPACTED.

WE MAY

BE SUBJECT TO LITIGATION PROCEEDINGS THAT COULD HARM OUR

BUSINESS.

IN ADDITION TO THE LITIGATION RISKS MENTIONED ABOVE, WE MAY BE

SUBJECT TO LEGAL CLAIMS OR REGULATORY MATTERS INVOLVING

STOCKHOLDER, CONSUMER, ANTITRUST, AND OTHER ISSUES. AS DESCRIBED

IN NOTE 21: CONTINGENCIES IN PART II,

ITEM 8 OF THIS

FORM 10-K,

WE ARE CURRENTLY ENGAGED IN A NUMBER OF LITIGATION MATTERS.

LITIGATION IS SUBJECT TO INHERENT UNCERTAINTIES, AND UNFAVORABLE

RULINGS COULD OCCUR. AN UNFAVORABLE RULING COULD INCLUDE

MONETARY DAMAGES OR, IN CASES FOR WHICH INJUNCTIVE RELIEF IS

SOUGHT, AN INJUNCTION PROHIBITING US FROM MANUFACTURING OR

SELLING ONE OR MORE PRODUCTS. WERE AN UNFAVORABLE RULING TO

OCCUR, OUR BUSINESS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COULD BE

MATERIALLY HARMED.

WE MAY

NOT BE ABLE TO ENFORCE OR PROTECT OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

RIGHTS, WHICH MAY HARM OUR ABILITY TO COMPETE AND HARM OUR

BUSINESS.

OUR ABILITY TO ENFORCE OUR PATENTS, COPYRIGHTS, SOFTWARE

LICENSES, AND OTHER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS IS SUBJECT TO

GENERAL LITIGATION RISKS, AS WELL AS UNCERTAINTY AS TO THE

ENFORCEABILITY OF OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS IN VARIOUS

COUNTRIES. WHEN WE SEEK TO ENFORCE OUR RIGHTS, WE ARE OFTEN

SUBJECT TO CLAIMS THAT THE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHT IS

INVALID, IS OTHERWISE NOT ENFORCEABLE, OR IS LICENSED TO THE

PARTY AGAINST WHOM WE ARE ASSERTING A CLAIM. IN ADDITION, OUR

ASSERTION OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS OFTEN RESULTS IN THE

OTHER PARTY SEEKING TO ASSERT ALLEGED INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

RIGHTS OF ITS OWN AGAINST US, WHICH MAY HARM OUR BUSINESS. IF WE

ARE NOT ULTIMATELY SUCCESSFUL IN DEFENDING OURSELVES AGAINST

THESE CLAIMS IN LITIGATION, WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO SELL A

PARTICULAR PRODUCT OR FAMILY OF PRODUCTS DUE TO AN INJUNCTION,

OR WE MAY HAVE TO PAY DAMAGES THAT COULD, IN TURN, HARM OUR

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. IN ADDITION, GOVERNMENTS MAY ADOPT

REGULATIONS OR COURTS MAY RENDER DECISIONS REQUIRING COMPULSORY

LICENSING OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY TO OTHERS, OR GOVERNMENTS MAY

REQUIRE THAT PRODUCTS MEET SPECIFIED STANDARDS THAT SERVE TO

FAVOR LOCAL COMPANIES. OUR INABILITY TO ENFORCE OUR INTELLECTUAL

PROPERTY RIGHTS UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES MAY HARM OUR

COMPETITIVE POSITION AND OUR BUSINESS.

17

TABLE OF CONTENTS

OUR

LICENSES WITH OTHER COMPANIES AND OUR PARTICIPATION IN INDUSTRY

INITIATIVES MAY ALLOW OTHER COMPANIES, INCLUDING OUR

COMPETITORS, TO USE OUR PATENT RIGHTS.

COMPANIES IN THE SEMICONDUCTOR INDUSTRY OFTEN RELY ON THE

ABILITY TO LICENSE PATENTS FROM EACH OTHER IN ORDER TO COMPETE.

MANY OF OUR COMPETITORS HAVE BROAD LICENSES OR CROSS-LICENSES

WITH US, AND UNDER CURRENT CASE LAW, SOME OF THESE LICENSES MAY

PERMIT THESE COMPETITORS TO PASS OUR PATENT RIGHTS ON TO OTHERS.

IF ONE OF THESE LICENSEES BECOMES A FOUNDRY, OUR COMPETITORS

MIGHT BE ABLE TO AVOID OUR PATENT RIGHTS IN MANUFACTURING

COMPETING PRODUCTS. IN ADDITION, OUR PARTICIPATION IN INDUSTRY

INITIATIVES MAY REQUIRE US TO LICENSE OUR PATENTS TO OTHER

COMPANIES THAT ADOPT CERTAIN INDUSTRY STANDARDS OR

SPECIFICATIONS, EVEN WHEN SUCH ORGANIZATIONS DO NOT ADOPT

STANDARDS OR SPECIFICATIONS PROPOSED BY US. AS A RESULT, OUR

PATENTS IMPLICATED BY OUR PARTICIPATION IN INDUSTRY INITIATIVES

MIGHT NOT BE AVAILABLE FOR US TO ENFORCE AGAINST OTHERS WHO

MIGHT OTHERWISE BE DEEMED TO BE INFRINGING THOSE PATENTS, OUR

COSTS OF ENFORCING OUR LICENSES OR PROTECTING OUR PATENTS MAY

INCREASE, AND THE VALUE OF OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY MAY BE

IMPAIRED.

CHANGES

IN OUR DECISIONS WITH REGARD TO OUR ANNOUNCED RESTRUCTURING AND

EFFICIENCY EFFORTS, AND OTHER FACTORS, COULD AFFECT OUR RESULTS

OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

FACTORS THAT COULD CAUSE ACTUAL RESULTS TO DIFFER MATERIALLY

FROM OUR EXPECTATIONS WITH REGARD TO OUR ANNOUNCED RESTRUCTURING

INCLUDE.



TIMING AND EXECUTION OF PLANS AND PROGRAMS THAT MAY BE SUBJECT

TO LOCAL LABOR LAW REQUIREMENTS, INCLUDING CONSULTATION WITH

APPROPRIATE WORKS COUNCILS;



CHANGES IN ASSUMPTIONS RELATED TO SEVERANCE AND POSTRETIREMENT

COSTS;



FUTURE DISPOSITIONS;



NEW BUSINESS INITIATIVES AND CHANGES IN PRODUCT ROADMAP,

DEVELOPMENT, AND MANUFACTURING;



CHANGES IN EMPLOYMENT LEVELS AND TURNOVER RATES;



CHANGES IN PRODUCT DEMAND AND THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT; AND



CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF CERTAIN LONG-LIVED ASSETS.

IN

ORDER TO COMPETE, WE MUST ATTRACT, RETAIN, AND MOTIVATE KEY

EMPLOYEES, AND OUR FAILURE TO DO SO COULD HARM OUR RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS.

IN ORDER TO COMPETE, WE MUST ATTRACT, RETAIN, AND MOTIVATE

EXECUTIVES AND OTHER KEY EMPLOYEES, INCLUDING THOSE IN

MANAGERIAL, TECHNICAL, SALES, MARKETING, AND SUPPORT POSITIONS.

HIRING AND RETAINING QUALIFIED EXECUTIVES, SCIENTISTS,

ENGINEERS, TECHNICAL STAFF, AND SALES REPRESENTATIVES ARE

CRITICAL TO OUR BUSINESS, AND COMPETITION FOR EXPERIENCED

EMPLOYEES IN THE SEMICONDUCTOR INDUSTRY CAN BE INTENSE. TO HELP

ATTRACT, RETAIN, AND MOTIVATE QUALIFIED EMPLOYEES, WE USE

SHARE-BASED INCENTIVE AWARDS SUCH AS EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTIONS AND

NON-VESTED SHARE UNITS (RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS). IF THE VALUE OF

SUCH STOCK AWARDS DOES NOT APPRECIATE AS MEASURED BY THE

PERFORMANCE OF THE PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK OR IF OUR

SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION OTHERWISE CEASES TO BE VIEWED AS A

VALUABLE BENEFIT, OUR ABILITY TO ATTRACT, RETAIN, AND MOTIVATE

EMPLOYEES COULD BE WEAKENED, WHICH COULD HARM OUR RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS.

OUR

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COULD VARY AS A RESULT OF THE METHODS,

ESTIMATES, AND JUDGMENTS THAT WE USE IN APPLYING OUR ACCOUNTING

POLICIES.

THE METHODS, ESTIMATES, AND JUDGMENTS THAT WE USE IN APPLYING

OUR ACCOUNTING POLICIES HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON OUR RESULTS

OF OPERATIONS (SEE CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES IN

PART II, ITEM 7 OF THIS

FORM 10-K).

SUCH METHODS, ESTIMATES, AND JUDGMENTS ARE, BY THEIR NATURE,

SUBJECT TO SUBSTANTIAL RISKS, UNCERTAINTIES, AND ASSUMPTIONS,

AND FACTORS MAY ARISE OVER TIME THAT LEAD US TO CHANGE OUR

METHODS, ESTIMATES, AND JUDGMENTS. CHANGES IN THOSE METHODS,

ESTIMATES, AND JUDGMENTS COULD SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT OUR RESULTS

OF OPERATIONS.

OUR

FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH APPLICABLE ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND

REGULATIONS WORLDWIDE COULD HARM OUR BUSINESS AND RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS.

THE MANUFACTURING AND ASSEMBLING AND TESTING OF OUR PRODUCTS

REQUIRE THE USE OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS THAT ARE SUBJECT TO A

BROAD ARRAY OF ENVIRONMENTAL, HEALTH, AND SAFETY LAWS AND

REGULATIONS. OUR FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH ANY OF THESE APPLICABLE

LAWS OR REGULATIONS COULD RESULT IN.



REGULATORY PENALTIES, FINES, AND LEGAL LIABILITIES;



SUSPENSION OF PRODUCTION;



ALTERATION OF OUR FABRICATION AND ASSEMBLY AND TEST PROCESSES;

AND



CURTAILMENT OF OUR OPERATIONS OR SALES.

IN ADDITION, OUR FAILURE TO MANAGE THE USE, TRANSPORTATION,

EMISSION, DISCHARGE, STORAGE, RECYCLING, OR DISPOSAL OF

HAZARDOUS MATERIALS COULD SUBJECT US TO INCREASED COSTS OR

FUTURE LIABILITIES. EXISTING AND FUTURE ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND

REGULATIONS COULD ALSO REQUIRE US TO ACQUIRE POLLUTION ABATEMENT

OR REMEDIATION EQUIPMENT, MODIFY OUR PRODUCT DESIGNS, OR INCUR

OTHER EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH SUCH LAWS AND REGULATIONS. MANY

NEW MATERIALS THAT WE ARE EVALUATING FOR USE IN OUR OPERATIONS

MAY BE SUBJECT TO REGULATION UNDER EXISTING OR FUTURE

ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS THAT MAY RESTRICT OUR USE OF

ONE OR MORE OF SUCH MATERIALS IN OUR MANUFACTURING, ASSEMBLY AND

TEST PROCESSES, OR PRODUCTS. ANY OF THESE RESTRICTIONS COULD

HARM OUR BUSINESS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS BY INCREASING OUR

EXPENSES OR REQUIRING US TO ALTER OUR MANUFACTURING AND ASSEMBLY

AND TEST PROCESSES.

18

TABLE OF CONTENTS

CHANGES

IN OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE MAY HARM OUR RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS.

A NUMBER OF FACTORS MAY INCREASE OUR FUTURE EFFECTIVE TAX RATES,

INCLUDING.



THE JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH PROFITS ARE DETERMINED TO BE EARNED

AND TAXED;



THE RESOLUTION OF ISSUES ARISING FROM TAX AUDITS WITH VARIOUS

ANY SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN OUR FUTURE EFFECTIVE TAX RATES COULD

REDUCE NET INCOME FOR FUTURE PERIODS.

WE

INVEST IN COMPANIES FOR STRATEGIC REASONS AND MAY NOT REALIZE A

RETURN ON OUR INVESTMENTS.

WE MAKE INVESTMENTS IN COMPANIES AROUND THE WORLD TO FURTHER OUR

STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES AND SUPPORT OUR KEY BUSINESS INITIATIVES.

SUCH INVESTMENTS INCLUDE INVESTMENTS IN EQUITY SECURITIES OF

PUBLIC COMPANIES AND NON-MARKETABLE EQUITY INVESTMENTS IN

PRIVATE COMPANIES, WHICH RANGE FROM EARLY-STAGE COMPANIES THAT

ARE OFTEN STILL DEFINING THEIR STRATEGIC DIRECTION TO MORE

MATURE COMPANIES WITH ESTABLISHED REVENUE STREAMS AND BUSINESS

MODELS. THE SUCCESS OF THESE COMPANIES IS DEPENDENT ON PRODUCT

DEVELOPMENT, MARKET ACCEPTANCE, OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCY, AND

OTHER KEY BUSINESS FACTORS. THE PRIVATE COMPANIES IN WHICH WE

INVEST MAY FAIL BECAUSE THEY MAY NOT BE ABLE TO SECURE

ADDITIONAL FUNDING, OBTAIN FAVORABLE INVESTMENT TERMS FOR FUTURE

FINANCINGS, OR TAKE ADVANTAGE OF LIQUIDITY EVENTS SUCH AS

INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERINGS, MERGERS, AND PRIVATE SALES. IF ANY OF

THESE PRIVATE COMPANIES FAIL, WE COULD LOSE ALL OR PART OF OUR

INVESTMENT IN THAT COMPANY. IF WE DETERMINE THAT AN

OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY DECLINE IN THE FAIR VALUE EXISTS FOR AN

EQUITY INVESTMENT IN A PUBLIC OR PRIVATE COMPANY IN WHICH WE

HAVE INVESTED, WE WRITE DOWN THE INVESTMENT TO ITS FAIR VALUE

AND RECOGNIZE THE RELATED WRITE-DOWN AS AN INVESTMENT LOSS.

FURTHERMORE, WHEN THE STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES OF AN INVESTMENT HAVE

BEEN ACHIEVED, OR IF THE INVESTMENT OR BUSINESS DIVERGES FROM

OUR STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES, WE MAY DECIDE TO DISPOSE OF THE

INVESTMENT. OUR NON-MARKETABLE EQUITY INVESTMENTS IN PRIVATE

COMPANIES ARE NOT LIQUID, AND WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO DISPOSE OF

THESE INVESTMENTS ON FAVORABLE TERMS OR AT ALL. THE OCCURRENCE

OF ANY OF THESE EVENTS COULD HARM OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

ADDITIONALLY, FOR CASES IN WHICH WE ARE REQUIRED UNDER EQUITY

METHOD ACCOUNTING TO RECOGNIZE A PROPORTIONATE SHARE OF ANOTHER

COMPANYS INCOME OR LOSS, SUCH INCOME AND LOSS MAY IMPACT

OUR EARNINGS.

INTEREST

AND OTHER, NET COULD VARY FROM EXPECTATIONS, WHICH COULD HARM

OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.



FIXED-INCOME INSTRUMENTS;



CHANGES IN OUR HEDGE ACCOUNTING TREATMENT; AND



GAINS OR LOSSES FROM DIVESTITURES.

OUR

ACQUISITIONS, DIVESTITURES, AND OTHER TRANSACTIONS COULD DISRUPT

OUR ONGOING BUSINESS AND HARM OUR RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS.

IN PURSUING OUR BUSINESS STRATEGY, WE ROUTINELY CONDUCT

DISCUSSIONS, EVALUATE OPPORTUNITIES, AND ENTER INTO AGREEMENTS

REGARDING POSSIBLE INVESTMENTS, ACQUISITIONS, DIVESTITURES, AND

OTHER TRANSACTIONS, SUCH AS JOINT VENTURES. ACQUISITIONS AND

OTHER TRANSACTIONS INVOLVE SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES AND RISKS,

INCLUDING RISKS THAT.



WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO IDENTIFY SUITABLE OPPORTUNITIES AT TERMS

ACCEPTABLE TO US;



THE TRANSACTION MAY NOT ADVANCE OUR BUSINESS STRATEGY;



WE MAY NOT REALIZE A SATISFACTORY RETURN ON THE INVESTMENT WE

MAKE;



WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO RETAIN KEY PERSONNEL OF THE ACQUIRED

BUSINESS; OR



WE MAY EXPERIENCE DIFFICULTY IN INTEGRATING NEW EMPLOYEES,

BUSINESS SYSTEMS, AND TECHNOLOGY.

WHEN WE DECIDE TO SELL ASSETS OR A BUSINESS, WE MAY ENCOUNTER

DIFFICULTY IN FINDING OR COMPLETING DIVESTITURE OPPORTUNITIES OR

ALTERNATIVE EXIT STRATEGIES ON ACCEPTABLE TERMS IN A TIMELY

MANNER, AND THE AGREED TERMS AND FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS COULD BE

RENEGOTIATED DUE TO CHANGES IN BUSINESS OR MARKET CONDITIONS.

THESE CIRCUMSTANCES COULD DELAY THE ACCOMPLISHMENT OF OUR

STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES OR CAUSE US TO INCUR ADDITIONAL EXPENSES

WITH RESPECT TO BUSINESSES THAT WE WANT TO DISPOSE OF, OR WE MAY

DISPOSE OF A BUSINESS AT A PRICE OR ON TERMS THAT ARE LESS THAN

WE HAD ANTICIPATED, RESULTING IN A LOSS ON THE TRANSACTION.

OVERVIEW

WE MAKE, MARKET, AND SELL ADVANCED INTEGRATED DIGITAL TECHNOLOGY

PRODUCTS, PRIMARILY INTEGRATED CIRCUITS, FOR INDUSTRIES SUCH AS

COMPUTING AND COMMUNICATIONS. INTEGRATED CIRCUITS ARE

SEMICONDUCTOR CHIPS ETCHED WITH INTERCONNECTED ELECTRONIC

SWITCHES. OUR GOAL IS TO BE THE PREEMINENT PROVIDER OF

SEMICONDUCTOR CHIPS AND PLATFORMS FOR THE WORLDWIDE DIGITAL

ECONOMY. OUR PRODUCTS INCLUDE CHIPS, BOARDS, AND OTHER

SEMICONDUCTOR PRODUCTS THAT ARE THE BUILDING BLOCKS INTEGRAL TO

COMPUTERS, SERVERS, CONSUMER ELECTRONICS AND HANDHELD DEVICES,

AND NETWORKING AND COMMUNICATIONS PRODUCTS. OUR PRIMARY

COMPONENT-LEVEL PRODUCTS INCLUDE MICROPROCESSORS, CHIPSETS, AND

FLASH MEMORY. WE OFFER PRODUCTS AT VARIOUS LEVELS OF

INTEGRATION, ALLOWING OUR CUSTOMERS THE FLEXIBILITY TO CREATE

ADVANCED COMPUTING AND COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEMS AND PRODUCTS.

THE LIFE CYCLE OF OUR PRODUCTS IS VERY SHORT, SOMETIMES LESS

THAN A YEAR. OUR ABILITY TO COMPETE DEPENDS ON OUR ABILITY TO

IMPROVE OUR PRODUCTS AND PROCESSES FASTER THAN OUR COMPETITORS,

ANTICIPATE CHANGING CUSTOMER REQUIREMENTS, AND DEVELOP AND

LAUNCH NEW PRODUCTS AND PLATFORMS. OUR FAILURE TO RESPOND

QUICKLY TO TECHNOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENTS AND INCORPORATE NEW

FEATURES INTO OUR PRODUCTS COULD HARM OUR ABILITY TO COMPETE.

MAINTAINING SCALE IS KEY TO OUR STRATEGY OF RAMPING NEW

MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGIES AND PLATFORMS QUICKLY, DELIVERING

HIGH-PERFORMANCE

PRODUCTS, AND LOWERING UNIT COSTS.

AS OF DECEMBER 29, 2007, OUR OPERATING SEGMENTS INCLUDED

THE DIGITAL ENTERPRISE GROUP, MOBILITY GROUP, NAND PRODUCTS

GROUP, FLASH MEMORY GROUP, DIGITAL HOME GROUP, DIGITAL HEALTH

GROUP, AND SOFTWARE SOLUTIONS GROUP.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

MANAGEMENTS

DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF

OPERATION (CONTINUED)

OVERALL MICROPROCESSOR REVENUE CONTINUES TO GROW, AND WE

CONTINUE TO SEE A SHIFT IN OUR SALES MIX FROM DESKTOP

MICROPROCESSORS TO MOBILE MICROPROCESSORS. MICROPROCESSOR

REVENUE WITHIN THE MOBILITY GROUP OPERATING SEGMENT INCREASED BY

16% IN 2007 COMPARED TO 2006. THE GROWTH IN MOBILE

MICROPROCESSORS HAS OUTPACED THE GROWTH IN DESKTOP

MICROPROCESSORS, AND WE BELIEVE THIS TREND WILL CONTINUE, WITH A

CROSSOVER OCCURRING AS EARLY AS 2009. AS DEMAND FOR MOBILE

MICROPROCESSORS CONTINUES TO GROW IN THE PC MARKET SEGMENT,

SYSTEM PRICE POINTS HAVE EXPANDED TO INCLUDE NEW LOWER PRICES.

WE EXPECT CONTINUING EROSION IN AVERAGE SELLING PRICES FOR

MOBILE MICROPROCESSORS DUE TO THIS EXPANSION IN LOWER PRICE

POINTS AND A CONTINUED COMPETITIVE MARKET SEGMENT. HOWEVER,

MOBILE MICROPROCESSOR AVERAGE SELLING PRICES REMAIN HIGHER THAN

DESKTOP MICROPROCESSOR AVERAGE SELLING PRICES, AND THEREFORE THE

SHIFT IN OUR MIX TO MOBILE MICROPROCESSORS HAS A POSITIVE EFFECT

ON OUR RESULTS. DUE TO THE PRICE DIFFERENCES AMONG MOBILE,

DESKTOP, AND SERVER MICROPROCESSORS, THE MIX AND TYPES OF

PERFORMANCE CAPABILITIES OF MICROPROCESSORS SOLD AFFECT THE

AVERAGE SELLING PRICE OF OUR PRODUCTS AND HAVE A SUBSTANTIAL

IMPACT ON OUR REVENUE.

THE GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE WAS RELATIVELY FLAT IN 2007 COMPARED

TO 2006. DURING 2007, GROSS MARGIN BENEFITED FROM LOWER

MICROPROCESSOR UNIT COSTS AS WELL AS A MIX SHIFT TOWARD HIGHER

MARGIN BUSINESSES. THE DECLINE IN UNIT COSTS HAS BEEN POSSIBLE

AS WE CONTINUED TO GAIN PRODUCTION EXPERIENCE ON OUR 65NM

PROCESS TECHNOLOGY. IN ADDITION, WE ARE RUNNING OUR FACTORIES AT

HIGH VOLUMES. HOWEVER, DURING 2007 OUR GROSS MARGIN WAS

NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY DECLINING AVERAGE SELLING PRICES AS WELL

AS HIGHER

START-UP

COSTS RELATED TO OUR 45NM PROCESS TECHNOLOGY.

OUR OPERATING INCOME GREW FASTER THAN REVENUE DURING 2007 AS WE

CONTINUED TO IMPLEMENT OUR RESTRUCTURING PROGRAM AND FOCUSED ON

OUR COMMITMENT TO EFFICIENCY AND ON SPENDING CONTROLS. AS A

RESULT, R&D AND MARKETING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE

EXPENSES AS A PERCENTAGE OF REVENUE DECREASED FROM 34% IN 2006

TO 29% IN 2007, AND THE NUMBER OF EMPLOYEES DECREASED BY 8%

COMPARED TO THE END OF 2006. RESULTS FOR 2007 INCLUDED

RESTRUCTURING AND ASSET IMPAIRMENT CHARGES OF $516 MILLION,

AND TO DATE WE HAVE INCURRED $1.1 BILLION IN CHARGES

RELATED TO THE PROGRAM, WHICH BEGAN IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF

2006. WE EXPECT TO CONTINUE THE PROGRAM IN 2008, AND EXPECT

CHARGES TO DECLINE IN THE SECOND HALF OF THE YEAR. AS PART OF

THE RESTRUCTURING PROGRAM, WE DIVESTED SOME OF OUR LOWER MARGIN

BUSINESSES, AND WE EXPECT TO DIVEST OUR NOR FLASH MEMORY ASSETS

IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2008. AS A RESULT OF THESE DIVESTITURES,

WE EXPECT A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON REVENUE AND A BENEFIT TO OUR

GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE IN 2008. OUR EFFICIENCY EFFORTS HAVE

ALSO CONTRIBUTED TO FASTER FACTORY THROUGHPUT, HIGHER YIELDS,

AND IMPROVED EQUIPMENT UTILIZATION. IMPROVEMENTS IN OUR

EQUIPMENT UTILIZATION HELPED ENABLE US TO REDUCE OUR CAPITAL

SPENDING FROM $5.9 BILLION IN 2006 TO $5.0 BILLION IN

2007.

THE COMBINATION OF OUR TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATION AND OUR RENEWED

COMMITMENT TO CUSTOMER ORIENTATION HAS DIFFERENTIATED OUR

PRODUCTS AND TECHNOLOGY FROM OUR COMPETITION AND HAS CONTRIBUTED

TO OUR REVENUE GROWTH, WHICH OCCURRED IN NEARLY ALL PRODUCT

LINES AND ACROSS ALL GEOGRAPHIES. WE ARE SETTING THE PACE FOR

INNOVATION WITHIN THE INDUSTRY BY EXECUTING ON OUR PLAN TO

INTRODUCE A NEW MICROARCHITECTURE APPROXIMATELY EVERY TWO YEARS

AND TO RAMP THE NEXT GENERATION OF SILICON PROCESS TECHNOLOGY IN

THE INTERVENING YEARS. IN 2007, WE COMPLETED OUR TRANSITION TO

THE INTEL CORE MICROARCHITECTURE, INITIALLY LAUNCHED IN 2006, IN

ALL MARKET SEGMENTS. WE ALSO STARTED MANUFACTURING

MICROPROCESSORS USING OUR INDUSTRY-LEADING 45NM HI-K METAL GATE

SILICON TECHNOLOGY, WHICH ENABLES HIGHER AND MORE

ENERGY-EFFICIENT

PROCESSOR PERFORMANCE. OUR NEXT-GENERATION MICROARCHITECTURE IS

SCHEDULED FOR PRODUCTION IN THE SECOND HALF OF 2008; AND WE ARE

ALSO DEVELOPING OUR NEXT-GENERATION 32NM PROCESS TECHNOLOGY AND

EXPECT TO BEGIN MANUFACTURING PRODUCTS USING THAT TECHNOLOGY IN

2009.

FROM A FINANCIAL CONDITION PERSPECTIVE, WE ENDED 2007 WITH AN

INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO VALUED AT $19.3 BILLION, CONSISTING OF

CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS, FIXED-INCOME DEBT INSTRUMENTS

INCLUDED IN TRADING ASSETS, AND SHORT- AND LONG-TERM

INVESTMENTS. DURING 2007, WE REPURCHASED $2.75 BILLION OF

STOCK THROUGH OUR STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM AND PAID

$2.6 BILLION TO STOCKHOLDERS AS DIVIDENDS.

WE EXITED 2007 WITH WHAT WE BELIEVE IS THE STRONGEST COMBINATION

OF PRODUCTS, MANUFACTURING, AND SILICON TECHNOLOGY LEADERSHIP IN

OUR HISTORY AS WE CONTINUE TO RAMP OUR 45NM PROCESS TECHNOLOGY

AND PLAN TO INTRODUCE OUR NEXT-GENERATION MICROARCHITECTURE IN

2008. ALSO IN 2008, WE PLAN TO INTRODUCE PRODUCTS GEARED TO

FUTURE GROWTH MARKETS. SPECIFICALLY, WE PLAN TO INTRODUCE NEW

MICROPROCESSORS,

CODE-NAMED

SILVERTHORNE, THAT ARE DESIGNED FOR NOTEBOOKS,

LOW-POWER AND LOW-COST PRODUCTS, MIDS, AND CONSUMER ELECTRONICS

DEVICES. IN ADDITION TO OUR MICROPROCESSOR AND CHIPSET

DEVELOPMENT, WE EXPECT TO MAKE SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS IN

R&D IN 2008 IN GROWTH AREAS SUCH AS

SYSTEM-ON-A-CHIP,

MIDS, EMBEDDED APPLICATIONS, CONSUMER ELECTRONICS, AND GRAPHICS.

ALTHOUGH THERE IS UNCERTAINTY IN THE GLOBAL ECONOMY, WE ARE

PLANNING FOR ANOTHER YEAR OF GROWTH IN WHICH PROFITS GROW FASTER

THAN REVENUE AND OUR INVESTMENTS IN PRODUCTS, MANUFACTURING, AND

SILICON TECHNOLOGY CONTINUE TO GENERATE COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGES.

USE OUR CORE COMPETENCIES IN THE DESIGN AND MANUFACTURE OF

INTEGRATED CIRCUITS, AS WELL AS OUR FINANCIAL RESOURCES, GLOBAL

PRESENCE, AND BRAND RECOGNITION. WE BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE THE

SCALE, CAPACITY, AND GLOBAL REACH TO ESTABLISH NEW TECHNOLOGIES

AND RESPOND TO CUSTOMERS NEEDS QUICKLY.

SOME OF OUR KEY FOCUS AREAS ARE LISTED BELOW.



CUSTOMER ORIENTATION.

OUR STRATEGY FOCUSES ON

DEVELOPING OUR NEXT GENERATION OF PRODUCTS BASED ON THE NEEDS

AND EXPECTATIONS OF OUR CUSTOMERS. IN TURN, OUR PRODUCTS HELP

ENABLE THE DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT OF NEW FORM FACTORS AND USAGE

MODELS FOR BUSINESSES AND CONSUMERS. WE OFFER PLATFORMS WITH

INGREDIENTS DESIGNED AND CONFIGURED TO WORK TOGETHER TO PROVIDE

AN OPTIMIZED USER COMPUTING SOLUTION COMPARED TO INGREDIENTS

THAT ARE USED SEPARATELY.



ENERGY-EFFICIENT PERFORMANCE.

WE BELIEVE THAT USERS

OF COMPUTING AND COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEMS AND DEVICES WANT

IMPROVED OVERALL AND ENERGY-EFFICIENT PERFORMANCE. IMPROVED

OVERALL PERFORMANCE CAN INCLUDE FASTER PROCESSING PERFORMANCE

AND OTHER CAPABILITIES SUCH AS MULTITHREADING AND MULTITASKING.

PERFORMANCE CAN ALSO BE IMPROVED THROUGH ENHANCED CONNECTIVITY,

SECURITY, MANAGEABILITY, RELIABILITY, EASE OF USE, AND

INTEROPERABILITY AMONG DEVICES. IMPROVED ENERGY-EFFICIENT

PERFORMANCE INVOLVES BALANCING THE ADDITION OF THESE AND OTHER

TYPES OF IMPROVED PERFORMANCE FACTORS WITH LOWER POWER

CONSUMPTION. OUR MICROPROCESSORS HAVE ONE, TWO, OR FOUR

PROCESSOR CORES, AND WE CONTINUE TO DEVELOP PROCESSORS WITH AN

INCREASING NUMBER OF CORES, WHICH ENABLE IMPROVED MULTITASKING

AND ENERGY EFFICIENCY.



DESIGN AND MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY LEADERSHIP.

OUR

STRATEGY FOR DEVELOPING MICROPROCESSORS WITH IMPROVED

PERFORMANCE IS TO SYNCHRONIZE THE INTRODUCTION OF A NEW

MICROARCHITECTURE WITH IMPROVEMENTS IN SILICON PROCESS

TECHNOLOGY. WE PLAN TO INTRODUCE A NEW MICROARCHITECTURE

APPROXIMATELY EVERY TWO YEARS AND RAMP THE NEXT GENERATION OF

SILICON PROCESS TECHNOLOGY IN THE INTERVENING YEARS. THIS

COORDINATED SCHEDULE ALLOWS US TO DEVELOP AND INTRODUCE NEW

PRODUCTS BASED ON A COMMON MICROARCHITECTURE QUICKLY, WITHOUT

WAITING FOR THE NEXT GENERATION OF SILICON PROCESS TECHNOLOGY.

WE REFER TO THIS AS OUR TICK-TOCK TECHNOLOGY

DEVELOPMENT CADENCE. FOR MORE INFORMATION, SEE RESEARCH

AND DEVELOPMENT IN PART I, ITEM 1 OF THIS FORM

10-K.



STRATEGIC INVESTMENTS.

WE MAKE EQUITY INVESTMENTS IN

COMPANIES AROUND THE WORLD TO FURTHER OUR STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES

AND TO SUPPORT OUR KEY BUSINESS INITIATIVES, INCLUDING

INVESTMENTS THROUGH OUR INTEL CAPITAL PROGRAM. WE GENERALLY

FOCUS ON INVESTING IN COMPANIES AND INITIATIVES TO STIMULATE

GROWTH IN THE DIGITAL ECONOMY, CREATE NEW BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES

FOR INTEL, AND EXPAND GLOBAL MARKETS FOR OUR PRODUCTS. OUR

CURRENT INVESTMENT FOCUS AREAS INCLUDE THOSE THAT WE BELIEVE

HELP TO ENABLE MOBILE WIRELESS DEVICES, ADVANCE THE DIGITAL

HOME, ENHANCE THE DIGITAL ENTERPRISE, ADVANCE HIGH-PERFORMANCE

COMMUNICATIONS INFRASTRUCTURES, AND DEVELOP THE NEXT GENERATION

OF SILICON PROCESS TECHNOLOGIES. OUR FOCUS AREAS TEND TO DEVELOP

AND CHANGE OVER TIME DUE TO RAPID ADVANCEMENTS IN TECHNOLOGY.



BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT AND SOFTWARE.

WE PLAN TO

CONTINUE TO CULTIVATE NEW BUSINESSES AND WORK TO ENCOURAGE THE

INDUSTRY TO OFFER PRODUCTS THAT TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE LATEST

MARKET TRENDS AND USAGE MODELS. WE ALSO PROVIDE DEVELOPMENT

TOOLS AND SUPPORT TO HELP SOFTWARE DEVELOPERS CREATE SOFTWARE

APPLICATIONS AND OPERATING SYSTEMS THAT TAKE ADVANTAGE OF OUR

PLATFORMS. WE FREQUENTLY PARTICIPATE IN INDUSTRY INITIATIVES

DESIGNED TO DISCUSS AND AGREE UPON TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS AND

OTHER ASPECTS OF TECHNOLOGIES THAT COULD BE ADOPTED AS STANDARDS

BY STANDARDS-SETTING ORGANIZATIONS. IN ADDITION, WE WORK

COLLABORATIVELY WITH OTHER COMPANIES TO PROTECT DIGITAL CONTENT

AND THE CONSUMER. LASTLY, THROUGH OUR SOFTWARE AND SOLUTIONS

GROUP, WE HELP ENABLE AND ADVANCE THE COMPUTING ECOSYSTEM BY

DEVELOPING VALUE-ADDED SOFTWARE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES.

WE BELIEVE THAT THE PROLIFERATION OF THE INTERNET, INCLUDING

USER DEMAND FOR PREMIUM CONTENT AND RICH MEDIA, IS THE PRIMARY

DRIVER OF THE NEED FOR GREATER PERFORMANCE IN PCS AND SERVERS. A

GROWING NUMBER OF OLDER PCS ARE INCREASINGLY INCAPABLE OF

HANDLING THE TASKS THAT USERS ARE DEMANDING, SUCH AS STREAMING

VIDEO, UPLOADING PHOTOS, AND ONLINE GAMING. AS THESE TASKS

BECOME EVEN MORE DEMANDING AND REQUIRE MORE COMPUTING POWER, WE

BELIEVE THAT USERS WILL NEED AND WANT TO BUY NEW PCS TO PERFORM

EVERYDAY TASKS ON THE INTERNET. WE ALSO BELIEVE THAT INCREASED

INTERNET TRAFFIC IS CREATING A NEED FOR GREATER SERVER

INFRASTRUCTURE, INCLUDING SERVER PRODUCTS OPTIMIZED FOR

ENERGY-EFFICIENT PERFORMANCE.

WE HAVE EXPERIENCED AN OVERALL SHIFT IN SALES MIX FROM DESKTOP

MICROPROCESSORS TO MOBILE MICROPROCESSORS. WE BELIEVE THAT,

BASED ON CUSTOMER DEMAND AND MARKET TRENDS, MOBILE

MICROPROCESSOR SHIPMENTS WILL EXCEED DESKTOP MICROPROCESSOR

SHIPMENTS AS EARLY AS 2009. MOBILE MICROPROCESSORS GENERALLY

HAVE HIGHER AVERAGE SELLING PRICES COMPARED TO DESKTOP

MICROPROCESSORS, SO THE CONTINUED SHIFT IN SALES MIX TO MOBILE

MICROPROCESSORS IS EXPECTED TO POSITIVELY IMPACT OUR REVENUE.

THEREFORE, OUR STRATEGY FOCUSES ON ADVANCING MOBILE

MICROPROCESSORS TO ACCELERATE THIS SHIFT IN SALES MIX.

CRITICAL

ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

THE METHODS, ESTIMATES, AND JUDGMENTS THAT WE USE IN APPLYING

OUR ACCOUNTING POLICIES HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE RESULTS

THAT WE REPORT IN OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. SOME OF OUR

ACCOUNTING POLICIES REQUIRE US TO MAKE DIFFICULT AND SUBJECTIVE

JUDGMENTS, OFTEN AS A RESULT OF THE NEED TO MAKE ESTIMATES

REGARDING MATTERS THAT ARE INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN. OUR MOST

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES INCLUDE.



THE VALUATION OF NON-MARKETABLE EQUITY INVESTMENTS, WHICH

IMPACTS NET GAINS (LOSSES) ON EQUITY INVESTMENTS WHEN WE RECORD

IMPAIRMENTS;



THE ASSESSMENT OF RECOVERABILITY OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS, WHICH

PRIMARILY IMPACTS GROSS MARGIN OR OPERATING EXPENSES WHEN WE

RECORD ASSET IMPAIRMENTS OR ACCELERATE THEIR DEPRECIATION;



THE RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT OF CURRENT AND DEFERRED INCOME

TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES (INCLUDING THE MEASUREMENT OF

UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS), WHICH IMPACT OUR TAX PROVISION;



THE VALUATION OF INVENTORY, WHICH IMPACTS GROSS MARGIN; AND



THE VALUATION AND RECOGNITION OF SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION, WHICH

IMPACT GROSS MARGIN; R&D EXPENSES; AND MARKETING, GENERAL

AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES.

BELOW, WE DISCUSS THESE POLICIES FURTHER, AS WELL AS THE

ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS INVOLVED. WE ALSO HAVE OTHER POLICIES

THAT WE CONSIDER KEY ACCOUNTING POLICIES, SUCH AS THOSE FOR

REVENUE RECOGNITION, INCLUDING THE DEFERRAL OF REVENUE ON SALES

TO DISTRIBUTORS; HOWEVER, THESE POLICIES TYPICALLY DO NOT

REQUIRE US TO MAKE ESTIMATES OR JUDGMENTS THAT ARE DIFFICULT OR

SUBJECTIVE.

NON-MARKETABLE

EQUITY INVESTMENTS

WE REGULARLY INVEST IN NON-MARKETABLE EQUITY INVESTMENTS OF

PRIVATE COMPANIES, WHICH RANGE FROM EARLY-STAGE COMPANIES THAT

ARE OFTEN STILL DEFINING THEIR STRATEGIC DIRECTION TO MORE

MATURE COMPANIES WITH ESTABLISHED REVENUE STREAMS AND BUSINESS

MODELS. THE CARRYING VALUE OF OUR NON-MARKETABLE EQUITY

INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO, EXCLUDING EQUITY DERIVATIVES, TOTALED

$3.4 BILLION AT DECEMBER 29, 2007 ($2.8 BILLION

AT DECEMBER 30, 2006) AND INCLUDED OUR INVESTMENT IN

IMFT OF $2.2 BILLION ($1.3 BILLION AT

DECEMBER 30, 2006). OUR NON-MARKETABLE EQUITY INVESTMENTS

ARE CLASSIFIED IN OTHER LONG-TERM ASSETS ON THE CONSOLIDATED

BALANCE SHEETS.

NON-MARKETABLE EQUITY INVESTMENTS ARE INHERENTLY RISKY, AND A

NUMBER OF THESE COMPANIES ARE LIKELY TO FAIL. THEIR SUCCESS IS

DEPENDENT ON PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT, MARKET ACCEPTANCE, OPERATIONAL

EFFICIENCY, AND OTHER FACTORS. IN ADDITION, DEPENDING ON THEIR

FUTURE PROSPECTS AND MARKET CONDITIONS, THEY MAY NOT BE ABLE TO

RAISE ADDITIONAL FUNDS WHEN NEEDED OR THEY MAY RECEIVE LOWER

VALUATIONS, WITH LESS FAVORABLE INVESTMENT TERMS THAN IN

PREVIOUS FINANCINGS, AND OUR INVESTMENTS WOULD LIKELY BECOME

IMPAIRED.

WE REVIEW OUR INVESTMENTS QUARTERLY FOR INDICATORS OF

IMPAIRMENT; HOWEVER, FOR NON-MARKETABLE EQUITY INVESTMENTS, THE

IMPAIRMENT ANALYSIS REQUIRES SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT TO IDENTIFY

EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES THAT WOULD SIGNIFICANTLY HARM THE FAIR

VALUE OF THE INVESTMENT. THE INDICATORS THAT WE USE TO IDENTIFY

THOSE EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES INCLUDE.



THE INVESTEES REVENUE AND EARNINGS TRENDS RELATIVE TO

PREDEFINED MILESTONES AND OVERALL BUSINESS PROSPECTS;



THE TECHNOLOGICAL FEASIBILITY OF THE INVESTEES PRODUCTS

AND TECHNOLOGIES;



THE GENERAL MARKET CONDITIONS IN THE INVESTEES INDUSTRY OR

GEOGRAPHIC AREA, INCLUDING ADVERSE REGULATORY OR ECONOMIC

CHANGES;



FACTORS RELATED TO THE INVESTEES ABILITY TO REMAIN IN

BUSINESS, SUCH AS THE INVESTEES LIQUIDITY, DEBT RATIOS,

AND THE RATE AT WHICH THE INVESTEE IS USING ITS CASH; AND



THE INVESTEES RECEIPT OF ADDITIONAL FUNDING AT A LOWER

VALUATION. IF AN INVESTEE OBTAINS ADDITIONAL FUNDING AT A

VALUATION LOWER THAN OUR CARRYING AMOUNT OR A NEW ROUND OF

EQUITY FUNDING IS REQUIRED FOR THE INVESTEE TO REMAIN IN

BUSINESS, AND THE NEW ROUND OF EQUITY DOES NOT APPEAR IMMINENT,

IT IS PRESUMED THAT THE INVESTMENT IS OTHER THAN TEMPORARILY

IMPAIRED, UNLESS SPECIFIC FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE

OTHERWISE.

INVESTMENTS THAT WE IDENTIFY AS HAVING AN INDICATOR OF

IMPAIRMENT ARE SUBJECT TO FURTHER ANALYSIS TO DETERMINE IF THE

INVESTMENT IS OTHER THAN TEMPORARILY IMPAIRED, IN WHICH CASE WE

WRITE DOWN THE INVESTMENT TO ITS ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE. FOR

NON-MARKETABLE EQUITY INVESTMENTS THAT WE DO NOT CONSIDER VIABLE

FROM A FINANCIAL OR TECHNOLOGICAL POINT OF VIEW, WE WRITE DOWN

THE ENTIRE INVESTMENT, SINCE WE CONSIDER THE ESTIMATED FAIR

VALUE TO BE NOMINAL. OVER THE PAST 12 QUARTERS, INCLUDING THE

FOURTH QUARTER OF 2007, IMPAIRMENTS OF NON-MARKETABLE EQUITY

INVESTMENTS HAVE RANGED BETWEEN $10 MILLION AND

$44 MILLION PER QUARTER.

OPERATION (CONTINUED)

LONG-LIVED

ASSETS

WE ASSESS THE IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS WHEN EVENTS OR

CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THAT THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE

ASSETS OR THE ASSET GROUPING MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE. FACTORS

THAT WE CONSIDER IN DECIDING WHEN TO PERFORM AN IMPAIRMENT

REVIEW INCLUDE SIGNIFICANT UNDER-PERFORMANCE OF A BUSINESS OR

PRODUCT LINE IN RELATION TO EXPECTATIONS, SIGNIFICANT NEGATIVE

INDUSTRY OR ECONOMIC TRENDS, AND SIGNIFICANT CHANGES OR PLANNED

CHANGES IN OUR USE OF THE ASSETS. RECOVERABILITY OF ASSETS THAT

WILL CONTINUE TO BE USED IN OUR OPERATIONS IS MEASURED BY

COMPARING THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF THE ASSET GROUPING TO OUR

ESTIMATE OF THE RELATED TOTAL FUTURE UNDISCOUNTED NET CASH

FLOWS. IF AN ASSET GROUPINGS CARRYING VALUE IS NOT

RECOVERABLE THROUGH THE RELATED UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS, THE

ASSET GROUPING IS CONSIDERED TO BE IMPAIRED. THE IMPAIRMENT IS

MEASURED BY COMPARING THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE ASSET

GROUPINGS CARRYING AMOUNT AND ITS FAIR VALUE, BASED ON THE

BEST INFORMATION AVAILABLE, INCLUDING MARKET PRICES OR

DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW ANALYSIS.

IMPAIRMENTS OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS ARE DETERMINED FOR GROUPS OF

ASSETS RELATED TO THE LOWEST LEVEL OF IDENTIFIABLE INDEPENDENT

CASH FLOWS. DUE TO OUR ASSET USAGE MODEL AND THE INTERCHANGEABLE

NATURE OF OUR SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING CAPACITY, WE MUST MAKE

SUBJECTIVE JUDGMENTS IN DETERMINING THE INDEPENDENT CASH FLOWS

THAT CAN BE RELATED TO SPECIFIC ASSET GROUPINGS. IN ADDITION, AS

WE MAKE MANUFACTURING PROCESS CONVERSIONS AND OTHER FACTORY

PLANNING DECISIONS, WE MUST MAKE SUBJECTIVE JUDGMENTS REGARDING

THE REMAINING USEFUL LIVES OF ASSETS, PRIMARILY PROCESS-SPECIFIC

SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING TOOLS AND BUILDING IMPROVEMENTS.

WHEN WE DETERMINE THAT THE USEFUL LIVES OF ASSETS ARE SHORTER

THAN WE HAD ORIGINALLY ESTIMATED, WE ACCELERATE THE RATE OF

DEPRECIATION OVER THE ASSETS NEW, SHORTER USEFUL LIVES.

OVER THE PAST 12 QUARTERS, INCLUDING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2007,

IMPAIRMENTS AND ACCELERATED DEPRECIATION OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS

HAVE RANGED BETWEEN $1 MILLION AND $320 MILLION PER

QUARTER. THIS RANGE INCLUDES RESTRUCTURING CHARGES FOR ASSET

IMPAIRMENTS BETWEEN ZERO AND $317 MILLION PER QUARTER.

INCOME

TAXES

WE MUST MAKE CERTAIN ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS IN DETERMINING

INCOME TAX EXPENSE FOR FINANCIAL STATEMENT PURPOSES. THESE

ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS OCCUR IN THE CALCULATION OF TAX CREDITS,

BENEFITS, AND DEDUCTIONS, AND IN THE CALCULATION OF CERTAIN TAX

ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, WHICH ARISE FROM DIFFERENCES IN THE

TIMING OF RECOGNITION OF REVENUE AND EXPENSE FOR TAX AND

FINANCIAL STATEMENT PURPOSES, AS WELL AS THE INTEREST AND

PENALTIES RELATED TO THESE UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS. SIGNIFICANT

CHANGES TO THESE ESTIMATES MAY RESULT IN AN INCREASE OR DECREASE

TO OUR TAX PROVISION IN A SUBSEQUENT PERIOD.

WE MUST ASSESS THE LIKELIHOOD THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO RECOVER

OUR DEFERRED TAX ASSETS. IF RECOVERY IS NOT LIKELY, WE MUST

INCREASE OUR PROVISION FOR TAXES BY RECORDING A VALUATION

ALLOWANCE AGAINST THE DEFERRED TAX ASSETS THAT WE ESTIMATE WILL

NOT ULTIMATELY BE RECOVERABLE. WE BELIEVE THAT WE WILL

ULTIMATELY RECOVER A SUBSTANTIAL MAJORITY OF THE DEFERRED TAX

ASSETS RECORDED ON OUR CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS. HOWEVER,

SHOULD THERE BE A CHANGE IN OUR ABILITY TO RECOVER OUR DEFERRED

TAX ASSETS, OUR TAX PROVISION WOULD INCREASE IN THE PERIOD IN

WHICH WE DETERMINED THAT THE RECOVERY WAS NOT LIKELY.

THE CALCULATION OF OUR TAX LIABILITIES INVOLVES DEALING WITH

UNCERTAINTIES IN THE APPLICATION OF COMPLEX TAX REGULATIONS. IN

THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2007, WE ADOPTED FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING

STANDARDS BOARD (FASB) INTERPRETATION NO. 48,

ACCOUNTING FOR UNCERTAINTY IN INCOME TAXESAN

INTERPRETATION OF SFAS NO. 109 (FIN 48),

AND RELATED GUIDANCE (SEE NOTE 17: TAXES IN

PART II, ITEM 8 OF THIS

FORM 10-K).

AS A RESULT OF THE IMPLEMENTATION OF FIN 48, WE RECOGNIZE

LIABILITIES FOR UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS BASED ON THE TWO-STEP

PROCESS PRESCRIBED IN THE INTERPRETATION. THE FIRST STEP IS TO

EVALUATE THE TAX POSITION FOR RECOGNITION BY DETERMINING IF THE

WEIGHT OF AVAILABLE EVIDENCE INDICATES THAT IT IS MORE LIKELY

THAN NOT THAT THE POSITION WILL BE SUSTAINED ON AUDIT, INCLUDING

RESOLUTION OF RELATED APPEALS OR LITIGATION PROCESSES, IF ANY.

THE SECOND STEP REQUIRES US TO ESTIMATE AND MEASURE THE TAX

BENEFIT AS THE LARGEST AMOUNT THAT IS MORE THAN 50% LIKELY TO BE

REALIZED UPON ULTIMATE SETTLEMENT. IT IS INHERENTLY DIFFICULT

AND SUBJECTIVE TO ESTIMATE SUCH AMOUNTS, AS WE HAVE TO DETERMINE

THE PROBABILITY OF VARIOUS POSSIBLE OUTCOMES. WE REEVALUATE

THESE UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS ON A QUARTERLY BASIS. THIS

EVALUATION IS BASED ON FACTORS INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,

CHANGES IN FACTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES, CHANGES IN TAX LAW,

EFFECTIVELY SETTLED ISSUES UNDER AUDIT, AND NEW AUDIT ACTIVITY.

SUCH A CHANGE IN RECOGNITION OR MEASUREMENT WOULD RESULT IN THE

RECOGNITION OF A TAX BENEFIT OR AN ADDITIONAL CHARGE TO THE TAX

PROVISION.

INVENTORY

THE VALUATION OF INVENTORY REQUIRES US TO ESTIMATE OBSOLETE OR

EXCESS INVENTORY AS WELL AS INVENTORY THAT IS NOT OF SALEABLE

QUALITY. THE DETERMINATION OF OBSOLETE OR EXCESS INVENTORY

REQUIRES US TO ESTIMATE THE FUTURE DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS. THE

DEMAND FORECAST IS INCLUDED IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF OUR SHORT-TERM

MANUFACTURING PLANS TO ENABLE CONSISTENCY BETWEEN INVENTORY

VALUATION AND BUILD DECISIONS.

PRODUCT-SPECIFIC

FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES REVIEWED IN THE INVENTORY VALUATION

PROCESS INCLUDE A REVIEW OF THE CUSTOMER BASE, THE STAGE OF THE

PRODUCT LIFE CYCLE OF OUR PRODUCTS, CONSUMER CONFIDENCE, AND

CUSTOMER ACCEPTANCE OF OUR PRODUCTS, AS WELL AS AN ASSESSMENT OF

THE SELLING PRICE IN RELATION TO THE PRODUCT COST. IF OUR DEMAND

FORECAST FOR SPECIFIC PRODUCTS IS GREATER THAN ACTUAL DEMAND AND

WE FAIL TO REDUCE MANUFACTURING OUTPUT ACCORDINGLY, OR IF WE

FAIL TO FORECAST THE DEMAND ACCURATELY, WE COULD BE REQUIRED TO

WRITE OFF INVENTORY, WHICH WOULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR GROSS

MARGIN.

SHARE-BASED

COMPENSATION

EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2006, WE ADOPTED THE PROVISIONS OF

STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS (SFAS) NO. 123

(REVISED 2004), SHARED-BASED PAYMENT

(SFAS NO. 123(R)). SFAS NO. 123(R) REQUIRES

EMPLOYEE EQUITY AWARDS TO BE ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER THE FAIR VALUE

METHOD. TOTAL SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION DURING 2007 WAS

$952 MILLION ($1.4 BILLION IN 2006). DETERMINING THE

APPROPRIATE FAIR-VALUE MODEL AND CALCULATING THE FAIR VALUE OF

EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTIONS AND RIGHTS TO PURCHASE SHARES UNDER STOCK

PURCHASE PLANS AT THE DATE OF GRANT REQUIRE JUDGMENT. WE USE THE

BLACK-SCHOLES OPTION PRICING MODEL TO ESTIMATE THE FAIR VALUE OF

THESE SHARE-BASED AWARDS CONSISTENT WITH THE PROVISIONS OF

SFAS NO. 123(R). OPTION PRICING MODELS, INCLUDING THE

BLACK-SCHOLES MODEL, ALSO REQUIRE THE USE OF INPUT ASSUMPTIONS,

INCLUDING EXPECTED VOLATILITY, EXPECTED LIFE, EXPECTED DIVIDEND

RATE, AND EXPECTED RISK-FREE RATE OF RETURN. THE ASSUMPTIONS FOR

EXPECTED VOLATILITY AND EXPECTED LIFE ARE THE TWO ASSUMPTIONS

THAT SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT THE GRANT DATE FAIR VALUE. CHANGES IN

THE EXPECTED DIVIDEND RATE AND EXPECTED RISK-FREE RATE OF RETURN

DO NOT SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT THE CALCULATION OF FAIR VALUE, AND

DETERMINING THESE INPUTS IS NOT HIGHLY SUBJECTIVE.

WE USE IMPLIED VOLATILITY BASED ON FREELY TRADED OPTIONS IN THE

OPEN MARKET, AS WE BELIEVE IMPLIED VOLATILITY IS MORE REFLECTIVE

OF MARKET CONDITIONS AND A BETTER INDICATOR OF EXPECTED

VOLATILITY THAN HISTORICAL VOLATILITY. IN DETERMINING THE

APPROPRIATENESS OF IMPLIED VOLATILITY, WE CONSIDERED THE

FOLLOWING.



THE VOLUME OF MARKET ACTIVITY OF FREELY TRADED OPTIONS, AND

DETERMINED THAT THERE WAS SUFFICIENT MARKET ACTIVITY;



THE ABILITY TO REASONABLY MATCH THE INPUT VARIABLES OF FREELY

TRADED OPTIONS TO THOSE OF OPTIONS GRANTED BY THE COMPANY, SUCH

AS THE DATE OF GRANT AND THE EXERCISE PRICE, AND DETERMINED THAT

THE INPUT ASSUMPTIONS WERE COMPARABLE; AND



THE TERM OF FREELY TRADED OPTIONS USED TO DERIVE IMPLIED

VOLATILITY, WHICH IS GENERALLY ONE TO TWO YEARS, AND DETERMINED

THAT THE LENGTH OF TERM WAS SUFFICIENT.

DUE TO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES IN THE VESTING TERMS AND

CONTRACTUAL LIFE OF CURRENT OPTION GRANTS COMPARED TO THE

MAJORITY OF OUR HISTORICAL GRANTS, MANAGEMENT DOES NOT BELIEVE

THAT OUR HISTORICAL SHARE OPTION EXERCISE DATA PROVIDES US WITH

SUFFICIENT EVIDENCE TO ESTIMATE EXPECTED TERM. THEREFORE, WE USE

THE SIMPLIFIED METHOD OF CALCULATING EXPECTED LIFE DESCRIBED IN

THE SECS STAFF ACCOUNTING BULLETIN 107

(SAB 107). IN DECEMBER 2007, THE SEC ISSUED STAFF

ACCOUNTING BULLETIN 110 (SAB 110) TO AMEND THE

SECS VIEWS DISCUSSED IN SAB 107 REGARDING THE USE OF

THE SIMPLIFIED METHOD IN DEVELOPING AN ESTIMATE OF EXPECTED LIFE

OF SHARE OPTIONS IN ACCORDANCE WITH SFAS NO. 123(R).

SAB 110 IS EFFECTIVE FOR US BEGINNING IN THE FIRST QUARTER

OF FISCAL YEAR 2008. WE WILL CONTINUE TO USE THE SIMPLIFIED

METHOD UNTIL WE HAVE THE HISTORICAL DATA NECESSARY TO PROVIDE A

REASONABLE ESTIMATE OF EXPECTED LIFE, IN ACCORDANCE WITH

SAB 107, AS AMENDED BY SAB 110.

FOR EXAMPLE, AN INCREASE FROM 26% REPORTED VOLATILITY FOR

2007 TO A HYPOTHETICAL 31% VOLATILITY.

IN ADDITION, SFAS NO. 123(R) REQUIRES US TO DEVELOP AN

ESTIMATE OF THE NUMBER OF SHARE-BASED AWARDS THAT WILL BE

FORFEITED DUE TO EMPLOYEE TURNOVER. QUARTERLY ADJUSTMENTS IN THE

ESTIMATED FORFEITURE RATES CAN HAVE A SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON

REPORTED SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION, AS WE RECOGNIZE THE

CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF THE RATE ADJUSTMENTS FOR ALL EXPENSE

AMORTIZATION AFTER JANUARY 1, 2006 IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH

THE ESTIMATED FORFEITURE RATES ARE ADJUSTED. WE ESTIMATE AND

ADJUST FORFEITURE RATES BASED ON A QUARTERLY REVIEW OF RECENT

FORFEITURE ACTIVITY AND EXPECTED FUTURE EMPLOYEE TURNOVER. IF A

REVISED FORFEITURE RATE IS HIGHER THAN OUR PREVIOUSLY ESTIMATED

FORFEITURE RATE, WE MAKE AN ADJUSTMENT THAT WILL RESULT IN A

DECREASE IN THE EXPENSE RECOGNIZED IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

IF A REVISED FORFEITURE RATE IS LOWER THAN THE PREVIOUSLY

ESTIMATED FORFEITURE RATE, WE MAKE AN ADJUSTMENT THAT WILL

RESULT IN AN INCREASE IN THE EXPENSE RECOGNIZED IN THE FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS. THESE ADJUSTMENTS AFFECT OUR GROSS MARGIN; R&D

EXPENSES; AND MARKETING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES.

THE EFFECT OF FORFEITURE ADJUSTMENTS IN 2006 AND 2007 WAS

INSIGNIFICANT. WE RECORD CUMULATIVE ADJUSTMENTS TO THE EXTENT

THAT THE RELATED EXPENSE IS RECOGNIZED IN THE FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS, BEGINNING WITH IMPLEMENTATION OF

SFAS NO. 123(R) IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2006.

THEREFORE, THE POTENTIAL IMPACT FROM CUMULATIVE FORFEITURE

ADJUSTMENTS WILL INCREASE IN FUTURE PERIODS. THE EXPENSE THAT WE

RECOGNIZE IN FUTURE PERIODS COULD ALSO DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM

THE CURRENT PERIOD AND FROM OUR FORECASTS DUE TO ADJUSTMENTS IN

THE ASSUMED FORFEITURE RATES.

OUR NET REVENUE WAS $38.3 BILLION IN 2007, AN INCREASE OF

8% COMPARED TO 2006. HIGHER MICROPROCESSOR UNIT SALES WERE

PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER MICROPROCESSOR AVERAGE SELLING PRICES.

HIGHER MOBILE CHIPSET UNIT SALES ALSO CONTRIBUTED TO THE

INCREASE IN NET REVENUE.

LOWER NOR FLASH MEMORY REVENUE WAS MOSTLY OFFSET BY THE RAMP OF

OUR NAND FLASH MEMORY BUSINESS. THE DECREASE IN NOR FLASH MEMORY

REVENUE WAS DUE TO A SIGNIFICANT DECLINE IN AVERAGE SELLING

PRICES. LOWER ROYALTY REVENUE WAS OFFSET BY HIGHER UNIT SALES.

REVENUE IN THE ASIA-PACIFIC REGION INCREASED 11% AND REVENUE IN

THE EUROPE REGION INCREASED 10% IN 2007 COMPARED TO 2006, AND

REVENUE IN BOTH THE AMERICAS REGION AND JAPAN INCREASED 3% IN

2007 COMPARED TO 2006. REVENUE FROM BOTH MATURE AND EMERGING

MARKETS INCREASED IN 2007 COMPARED TO 2006. WHILE THE REVENUE IN

MATURE MARKETS INCREASED IN ALL FOUR GEOGRAPHIC REGIONS, THE

MAJORITY OF THE GROWTH IN REVENUE OCCURRED IN THE ASIA-PACIFIC

REGION. A SUBSTANTIAL MAJORITY OF THE INCREASE IN EMERGING

MARKETS ALSO OCCURRED IN THE ASIA-PACIFIC REGION.

OUR OVERALL GROSS MARGIN DOLLARS FOR 2007 WERE

$19.9 BILLION, AN INCREASE OF $1.7 BILLION, OR 9%,

COMPARED TO 2006. OUR OVERALL GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE WAS

RELATIVELY FLAT AT 51.9% IN 2007 COMPARED TO 51.5% IN 2006. THE

GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE INCREASE IN THE DIGITAL ENTERPRISE GROUP

OPERATING SEGMENT WAS MOSTLY OFFSET BY A DECREASE IN THE GROSS

MARGIN PERCENTAGE IN THE MOBILITY GROUP OPERATING SEGMENT AND

COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE RAMP OF OUR NAND FLASH MEMORY

BUSINESS. WE DERIVED MOST OF OUR OVERALL GROSS MARGIN DOLLARS

AND OPERATING PROFIT IN 2007 AND 2006 FROM THE SALE OF

MICROPROCESSORS IN THE DIGITAL ENTERPRISE GROUP AND MOBILITY

GROUP OPERATING SEGMENTS. SEE BUSINESS OUTLOOK FOR A

DISCUSSION OF GROSS MARGIN EXPECTATIONS.

OUR NET REVENUE WAS $35.4 BILLION IN 2006, A DECREASE OF 9%

COMPARED TO 2005. SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE DECREASE WAS DUE TO

SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER AVERAGE SELLING PRICES OF MICROPROCESSORS.

FISCAL YEAR 2006 WAS A 52-WEEK FISCAL YEAR IN CONTRAST TO FISCAL

YEAR 2005, WHICH WAS A

53-WEEK

FISCAL YEAR.

REVENUE FROM SALES OF NOR FLASH MEMORY PRODUCTS DECREASED IN

2006 COMPARED TO 2005, PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER AVERAGE SELLING

PRICES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER ROYALTY REVENUE. IN 2006, WE

BEGAN SHIPPING NAND FLASH MEMORY PRODUCTS MANUFACTURED BY IMFT.

REVENUE IN THE ASIA-PACIFIC REGION DECREASED 10% AND REVENUE IN

THE EUROPE REGION DECREASED 20% IN 2006 COMPARED TO 2005. THESE

DECREASES WERE SLIGHTLY OFFSET BY REVENUE IN JAPAN, WHICH

INCREASED SLIGHTLY IN 2006 COMPARED TO 2005. REVENUE IN THE

AMERICAS REGION WAS APPROXIMATELY FLAT IN 2006 COMPARED TO 2005.

MATURE AND EMERGING MARKETS BOTH DECLINED IN 2006 COMPARED TO

2005. THE DECREASE WITHIN MATURE MARKETS OCCURRED IN THE EUROPE

AND ASIA-PACIFIC REGIONS, AND A SUBSTANTIAL MAJORITY OF THE

DECREASE WITHIN THE EMERGING MARKETS OCCURRED IN THE EUROPE AND

ASIA-PACIFIC REGIONS.

OUR OVERALL GROSS MARGIN DOLLARS FOR 2006 WERE

$18.2 BILLION, A DECREASE OF $4.8 BILLION, OR 21%,

COMPARED TO 2005. OUR OVERALL GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE DECREASED

TO 51.5% IN 2006 FROM 59.4% IN 2005. THE GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE

FOR THE DIGITAL ENTERPRISE GROUP AND THE MOBILITY GROUP WERE

BOTH LOWER IN 2006 COMPARED TO 2005. A MIX SHIFT OF OUR TOTAL

REVENUE TO THE MOBILITY GROUP, WHICH HAS A HIGHER GROSS MARGIN

PERCENTAGE, SLIGHTLY OFFSET THESE DECREASES TO THE OVERALL GROSS

MARGIN. WE DERIVED MOST OF OUR OVERALL GROSS MARGIN DOLLARS IN

2006 AND 2005 FROM THE SALE OF MICROPROCESSORS IN THE DIGITAL

ENTERPRISE GROUP AND MOBILITY GROUP OPERATING SEGMENTS. THE

2006 GROSS MARGIN INCLUDED THE IMPACT OF SHARE-BASED

COMPENSATION, WHICH WE BEGAN RECOGNIZING IN 2006. THE

2005 GROSS MARGIN WAS AFFECTED BY A LITIGATION SETTLEMENT

AGREEMENT WITH MICROUNITY, INC. IN WHICH WE RECORDED A

$140 MILLION CHARGE TO COST OF SALES, OF WHICH

$110 MILLION WAS ALLOCATED TO THE DIGITAL ENTERPRISE GROUP

AND $30 MILLION WAS ALLOCATED TO THE MOBILITY GROUP.

MICROPROCESSORS WITHIN DEG INCLUDE MICROPROCESSORS DESIGNED FOR

THE DESKTOP AND ENTERPRISE COMPUTING MARKET SEGMENTS AS WELL AS

EMBEDDED MICROPROCESSORS. THE INCREASE IN MICROPROCESSOR REVENUE

WAS DUE TO HIGHER MICROPROCESSOR UNIT SALES AND HIGHER

ENTERPRISE AVERAGE SELLING PRICES. THESE INCREASES WERE

PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER DESKTOP AVERAGE SELLING PRICES IN A

COMPETITIVE PRICING ENVIRONMENT. THE DECREASE IN CHIPSET,

MOTHERBOARD, AND OTHER REVENUE WAS DUE TO LOWER MOTHERBOARD UNIT

SALES AS WELL AS A DECREASE IN COMMUNICATIONS INFRASTRUCTURE

REVENUE, WHICH IS PRIMARILY DUE TO DIVESTITURES OF CERTAIN

COMMUNICATIONS INFRASTRUCTURE BUSINESSES THAT WERE COMPLETED IN

2006 AND 2007. PARTIALLY OFFSETTING THESE DECREASES WAS HIGHER

CHIPSET REVENUE.

OPERATING INCOME INCREASED BY $1.7 BILLION, OR 47%, IN 2007

COMPARED TO 2006. THE INCREASE IN OPERATING INCOME WAS PRIMARILY

DUE TO LOWER DESKTOP MICROPROCESSOR UNIT COSTS AND LOWER

OPERATING EXPENSES, AND TO A LESSER EXTENT, SALES OF DESKTOP

MICROPROCESSOR INVENTORY THAT HAD BEEN PREVIOUSLY WRITTEN OFF.

PARTIALLY OFFSETTING THESE INCREASES WERE HIGHER CHIPSET UNIT

COSTS AND APPROXIMATELY $425 MILLION OF HIGHER

START-UP

COSTS, PRIMARILY RELATED TO OUR 45NM PROCESS TECHNOLOGY. IN

2007, WE BEGAN INCLUDING SHARED-BASED COMPENSATION IN THE

COMPUTATION OF OPERATING INCOME (LOSS) FOR EACH OPERATING

SEGMENT AND ADJUSTED THE 2006 OPERATING SEGMENT RESULTS TO

REFLECT THIS CHANGE.

DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF

OPERATION (CONTINUED)

FOR 2006, NET REVENUE FOR THE DEG OPERATING SEGMENT DECREASED BY

$5.3 BILLION, OR 21%, COMPARED TO 2005. THE DECLINE IN NET

REVENUE WAS MOSTLY DUE TO A SIGNIFICANT DECLINE IN

MICROPROCESSOR REVENUE, AND TO A LESSER EXTENT, A DECLINE IN

CHIPSET, MOTHERBOARD, AND OTHER REVENUE. THE DECLINE IN

MICROPROCESSOR REVENUE WAS DUE TO LOWER AVERAGE SELLING PRICES

AND UNIT SALES OF DESKTOP MICROPROCESSORS. ENTERPRISE

MICROPROCESSOR REVENUE INCREASED IN 2006. THE DECLINE IN

CHIPSET, MOTHERBOARD, AND OTHER REVENUE WAS DUE EQUALLY TO LOWER

CHIPSET REVENUE AND MOTHERBOARD REVENUE.

OPERATING INCOME DECREASED BY $5.5 BILLION, OR 61%, IN 2006

COMPARED TO 2005. SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE DECREASE WAS DUE TO

THE REVENUE DECLINE. HIGHER MICROPROCESSOR UNIT COSTS, ALONG

WITH $210 MILLION OF HIGHER FACTORY UNDER-UTILIZATION

CHARGES, WERE OFFSET BY APPROXIMATELY $540 MILLION OF LOWER

START-UP

COSTS. UNIT COSTS WERE HIGHER IN 2006 COMPARED TO 2005 DUE

PRIMARILY TO A MIX SHIFT TO DUAL-CORE MICROPROCESSORS. RESULTS

FOR 2006 INCLUDED THE RECOGNITION OF SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION.

RESULTS FOR 2005 DID NOT INCLUDE SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION.

RESULTS FOR 2005 INCLUDED A CHARGE RELATED TO A SETTLEMENT

IN 2007 COMPARED TO 2006, WHILE CHIPSETS AND OTHER REVENUE

INCREASED BY $924 MILLION, OR 30%, IN 2007 COMPARED TO

2006. THE INCREASE IN MICROPROCESSOR REVENUE WAS DUE TO A

SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN UNIT SALES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY

SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER AVERAGE SELLING PRICES. THE INCREASE IN

CHIPSET AND OTHER REVENUE WAS DUE TO HIGHER UNIT SALES OF

CHIPSETS, AND TO A LESSER EXTENT, HIGHER REVENUE FROM SALES OF

CELLULAR BASEBAND PRODUCTS. IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2006, WE

SOLD CERTAIN ASSETS OF THE BUSINESS LINE THAT INCLUDED

APPLICATION AND CELLULAR BASEBAND PROCESSORS USED IN HANDHELD

DEVICES; HOWEVER, IN 2007 WE CONTINUED TO MANUFACTURE AND SELL

THESE PRODUCTS AS PART OF A MANUFACTURING AND TRANSITION

SERVICES AGREEMENT.

OPERATING INCOME INCREASED BY $1.0 BILLION, OR 22%, IN 2007

COMPARED TO 2006. THE INCREASE IN OPERATING INCOME WAS PRIMARILY

DUE TO HIGHER REVENUE. LOWER MICROPROCESSOR UNIT COSTS WERE MORE

THAN OFFSET BY APPROXIMATELY $330 MILLION OF HIGHER

START-UP

COSTS, PRIMARILY RELATED TO OUR 45NM PROCESS TECHNOLOGY. LOWER

UNIT COSTS ON WIRELESS CONNECTIVITY AND CELLULAR BASEBAND

PRODUCTS WERE OFFSET BY HIGHER CHIPSET UNIT COSTS. OPERATING

EXPENSES WERE HIGHER IN 2007 COMPARED TO 2006; HOWEVER,

OPERATING EXPENSES AS A PERCENTAGE OF REVENUE DECREASED IN 2007

COMPARED TO 2006.

FOR 2006, NET REVENUE FOR THE MG OPERATING SEGMENT INCREASED BY

$1.2 BILLION, OR 11%, COMPARED TO 2005. MICROPROCESSOR

REVENUE INCREASED BY $508 MILLION, OR 6%, IN 2006 COMPARED

TO 2005, WHILE CHIPSETS AND OTHER REVENUE INCREASED BY

$670 MILLION, OR 28%, IN 2006 COMPARED TO 2005. THE

INCREASE IN MICROPROCESSOR REVENUE WAS DUE TO HIGHER UNIT SALES,

LARGELY OFFSET BY LOWER AVERAGE SELLING PRICES. THE MAJORITY OF

THE INCREASE IN CHIPSET AND OTHER REVENUE WAS DUE TO HIGHER

REVENUE FROM SALES OF CHIPSETS, AND TO A LESSER EXTENT, HIGHER

REVENUE FROM SALES OF WIRELESS CONNECTIVITY PRODUCTS. SALES OF

THESE PRODUCTS INCREASED PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASED SALES OF OUR

INTEL CENTRINO PROCESSOR TECHNOLOGIES.

OPERATING INCOME DECREASED BY $740 MILLION, OR 14%, IN 2006

COMPARED TO 2005. THE DECLINE WAS PRIMARILY CAUSED BY HIGHER

OPERATING EXPENSES, DUE IN PART TO THE RECOGNITION OF

SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION. RESULTS FOR 2005 DID NOT INCLUDE

SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION. THE EFFECTS OF HIGHER REVENUE WERE

OFFSET BY HIGHER UNIT COSTS FOR MICROPROCESSORS.

START-UP

COSTS WERE APPROXIMATELY $170 MILLION LOWER IN 2006

COMPARED TO 2005.

LOWER PROCESS DEVELOPMENT COSTS AS WE TRANSITIONED FROM R&D

TO MANUFACTURING USING OUR 45NM PROCESS TECHNOLOGY, PARTIALLY

OFFSET BY HIGHER PROFIT-DEPENDENT COMPENSATION. THE INCREASE IN

2006 COMPARED TO 2005 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO SHARE-BASED

COMPENSATION RESULTING FROM THE IMPLEMENTATION OF

SFAS NO. 123(R) IN 2006, AND TO A LESSER EXTENT,

HIGHER DEVELOPMENT COSTS DRIVEN BY OUR 45NM PROCESS TECHNOLOGY.

MARKETING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE.

MARKETING,

GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES DECREASED $695 MILLION,

OR 11%, IN 2007 COMPARED TO 2006, AND INCREASED

$408 MILLION, OR 7%, IN 2006 COMPARED TO 2005. THE DECREASE

IN 2007 COMPARED TO 2006 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER HEADCOUNT,

LOWER SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION, AND LOWER COOPERATIVE

ADVERTISING EXPENSES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER

PROFIT-DEPENDENT COMPENSATION. THE INCREASE IN 2006 COMPARED TO

2005 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION RESULTING

FROM THE IMPLEMENTATION OF SFAS NO. 123(R) IN 2006,

AND TO A LESSER EXTENT, HIGHER HEADCOUNT. PARTIALLY OFFSETTING

THESE INCREASES WERE LOWER MARKETING PROGRAM SPENDING AND LOWER

PROFIT-DEPENDENT COMPENSATION.

R&D ALONG WITH MARKETING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE

EXPENSES WERE 29% OF NET REVENUE IN 2007, 34% OF NET REVENUE IN

2006, AND 28% OF NET REVENUE IN 2005. FISCAL YEAR 2005 INCLUDED

53 WEEKS. THE PERCENTAGE DECLINE IN 2007 COMPARED TO 2006

IS AN INDICATION OF OUR PROGRESS TOWARD IMPROVING OUR COST

STRUCTURE AND EFFICIENCY AS WE GREW REVENUE AT A FASTER RATE

THAN OPERATING EXPENSES.

RESTRUCTURING AND ASSET IMPAIRMENT CHARGES.

IN THE

THIRD QUARTER OF 2006, MANAGEMENT APPROVED SEVERAL ACTIONS THAT

WERE RECOMMENDED BY OUR STRUCTURE AND EFFICIENCY TASK FORCE AS

PART OF A RESTRUCTURING PLAN DESIGNED TO IMPROVE OPERATIONAL

EFFICIENCY AND FINANCIAL RESULTS. SOME OF THESE ACTIVITIES

INVOLVE COST SAVINGS OR OTHER ACTIONS THAT DO NOT RESULT IN

RESTRUCTURING CHARGES, SUCH AS BETTER UTILIZATION OF ASSETS,

REDUCED SPENDING, AND ORGANIZATIONAL EFFICIENCIES. THE

EFFICIENCY PROGRAM INCLUDES HEADCOUNT TARGETS FOR VARIOUS GROUPS

WITHIN THE COMPANY, AND THESE TARGETS ARE BEING MET THROUGH

ONGOING EMPLOYEE ATTRITION AND TERMINATIONS. IN ADDITION,

BUSINESS DIVESTITURES FURTHER REDUCE OUR HEADCOUNT.

FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION. IN CONNECTION WITH THE DIVESTITURE OF

CERTAIN ASSETS OF OUR COMMUNICATIONS AND APPLICATION PROCESSOR

BUSINESS, WE RECORDED IMPAIRMENT CHARGES OF $103 MILLION

RELATED TO THE WRITE-DOWN OF MANUFACTURING TOOLS TO THEIR FAIR

VALUE, LESS THE COST TO DISPOSE OF THE ASSETS. WE DETERMINED THE

FAIR VALUE USING A MARKET-BASED VALUATION TECHNIQUE. IN

ADDITION, AS A RESULT OF BOTH THIS DIVESTITURE AND A SUBSEQUENT

ASSESSMENT OF OUR WORLDWIDE MANUFACTURING CAPACITY OPERATIONS,

WE PLACED FOR SALE OUR FABRICATION FACILITY IN COLORADO SPRINGS,

COLORADO. THIS PLAN RESULTED IN AN IMPAIRMENT CHARGE OF

$214 MILLION TO WRITE DOWN TO FAIR VALUE THE LAND,

BUILDING, AND EQUIPMENT ASSET GROUPING THAT HAS BEEN PRINCIPALLY

USED TO SUPPORT OUR COMMUNICATIONS AND APPLICATION PROCESSOR

BUSINESS. WE DETERMINED THE FAIR MARKET VALUE OF THE ASSET

GROUPING USING AN AVERAGE OF THE RESULTS FROM USING THE COST

APPROACH AND MARKET APPROACH VALUATION TECHNIQUES.

DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF

OPERATION (CONTINUED)

DURING 2007, WE INCURRED AN ADDITIONAL $54 MILLION IN ASSET

IMPAIRMENT CHARGES AS A RESULT OF SOFTER THAN ANTICIPATED MARKET

CONDITIONS RELATED TO THE COLORADO SPRINGS FACILITY. ALSO, WE

RECORDED LAND AND BUILDING WRITE-DOWNS RELATED TO CERTAIN

FACILITIES IN SANTA CLARA, CALIFORNIA. IN ADDITION, DURING

THE FOURTH QUARTER WE INCURRED $85 MILLION IN ASSET

IMPAIRMENT CHARGES RELATED TO THE ANTICIPATED DIVESTITURE OF OUR

NOR FLASH MEMORY BUSINESS. THE IMPAIRMENT CHARGES WERE

DETERMINED USING THE REVISED FAIR VALUE, LESS SELLING COSTS,

THAT WE EXPECTED TO RECEIVE UPON COMPLETION OF THE DIVESTITURE.

WE RECORDED THE ADDITIONAL ACCRUALS, NET OF ADJUSTMENTS, AS

RESTRUCTURING AND ASSET IMPAIRMENT CHARGES ON THE CONSOLIDATED

STATEMENTS OF INCOME. THE REMAINING ACCRUAL AS OF

DECEMBER 29, 2007 WAS RELATED TO SEVERANCE BENEFITS THAT WE

RECORDED AS A CURRENT LIABILITY WITHIN ACCRUED COMPENSATION AND

BENEFITS ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS.

FROM THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2006 THROUGH THE FOURTH QUARTER OF

2007, WE INCURRED A TOTAL OF $1.1 BILLION IN RESTRUCTURING

AND ASSET IMPAIRMENT CHARGES RELATED TO THIS PLAN. THESE CHARGES

INCLUDED A TOTAL OF $527 MILLION RELATED TO EMPLOYEE

SEVERANCE AND BENEFIT ARRANGEMENTS DUE TO THE TERMINATION OF

APPROXIMATELY 9,900 EMPLOYEES, OF WHICH

7,700 EMPLOYEES HAD LEFT THE COMPANY AS OF

DECEMBER 29, 2007. A SUBSTANTIAL MAJORITY OF THESE EMPLOYEE

TERMINATIONS AFFECTED EMPLOYEES WITHIN MANUFACTURING,

INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY, AND MARKETING. OF THE EMPLOYEE SEVERANCE

AND BENEFIT CHARGES INCURRED AS OF DECEMBER 29, 2007, WE

HAD PAID $400 MILLION. THE RESTRUCTURING AND ASSET

IMPAIRMENT CHARGES ALSO INCLUDED $544 MILLION IN ASSET

IMPAIRMENT CHARGES.

WE ESTIMATE THAT EMPLOYEE SEVERANCE AND BENEFIT CHARGES TO DATE

WILL RESULT IN GROSS ANNUAL SAVINGS OF APPROXIMATELY

$1.0 BILLION, A PORTION OF WHICH WE BEGAN TO REALIZE IN THE

THIRD QUARTER OF 2006. WE ARE REALIZING THESE SAVINGS WITHIN

MARKETING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES, COST OF SALES,

AND R&D. OUR OUTLOOK FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2008 IS FOR

ADDITIONAL RESTRUCTURING AND ASSET IMPAIRMENT CHARGES OF

$100 MILLION. WE MAY INCUR ADDITIONAL RESTRUCTURING CHARGES

IN THE FUTURE FOR EMPLOYEE SEVERANCE AND BENEFIT ARRANGEMENTS,

AS WELL AS FACILITY-RELATED OR OTHER EXIT ACTIVITIES.

AMORTIZATION OF ACQUISITION-RELATED INTANGIBLES AND

COSTS.

AMORTIZATION OF ACQUISITION-RELATED INTANGIBLES

AND COSTS WAS $16 MILLION IN 2007 ($42 MILLION IN 2006

AND $126 MILLION IN 2005). THE DECREASED AMORTIZATION EACH

YEAR COMPARED TO THE PREVIOUS YEAR WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO A

PORTION OF THE INTANGIBLES RELATED TO PRIOR ACQUISITIONS

BECOMING FULLY AMORTIZED.

NET GAINS ON EQUITY INVESTMENTS WERE $157 MILLION IN 2007

COMPARED TO $214 MILLION IN 2006. DURING 2007, WE

RECOGNIZED HIGHER LOSSES FROM OUR EQUITY METHOD INVESTMENTS,

PRIMARILY FROM OUR INVESTMENT IN CLEARWIRE CORPORATION. IN

ADDITION, WE RECOGNIZED HIGHER IMPAIRMENT CHARGES, PARTIALLY

OFFSET BY HIGHER GAINS ON SALES OF EQUITY INVESTMENTS AND OTHER

EQUITY TRANSACTIONS. IMPAIRMENT CHARGES WERE $120 MILLION

IN 2007.

NET GAINS ON EQUITY INVESTMENTS WERE $214 MILLION IN 2006

COMPARED TO NET LOSSES OF $45 MILLION IN 2005. DURING 2006,

WE RECOGNIZED HIGHER GAINS ON SALES OF EQUITY INVESTMENTS AND

LOWER IMPAIRMENT CHARGES COMPARED TO 2005. NET GAINS ON EQUITY

INVESTMENTS IN 2006 INCLUDED THE GAIN OF $103 MILLION ON

THE SALE OF A PORTION OF OUR INVESTMENT IN MICRON, WHICH WAS

SOLD FOR $275 MILLION. IMPAIRMENT CHARGES WERE

$79 MILLION IN 2006 COMPARED TO $208 MILLION IN 2005.

DURING 2005, IMPAIRMENT CHARGES INCLUDED A $105 MILLION

IMPAIRMENT CHARGE ON OUR INVESTMENT IN MICRON.

INTEREST AND OTHER, NET DECREASED TO $793 MILLION IN 2007

COMPARED TO $1.2 BILLION IN 2006, PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER

DIVESTITURE GAINS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER INTEREST INCOME

RESULTING PRIMARILY FROM HIGHER AVERAGE INVESTMENT BALANCES, AND

TO A LESSER EXTENT HIGHER INTEREST RATES. INTEREST AND OTHER,

NET INCREASED TO $1.2 BILLION IN 2006 COMPARED TO

$565 MILLION IN 2005, REFLECTING NET GAINS OF

$612 MILLION FOR THREE DIVESTITURES (SEE

NOTE 13: DIVESTITURES IN PART II,

ITEM 8 OF THIS

FORM 10-K)

AND HIGHER INTEREST INCOME AS A RESULT OF HIGHER INTEREST RATES,

PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER AVERAGE INVESTMENT BALANCES.

OUR EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE WAS 23.9% IN 2007 (28.6% IN 2006

AND 31.3% IN 2005). THE RATE DECREASED IN 2007 COMPARED TO 2006,

PRIMARILY DUE TO THE REVERSAL OF PREVIOUSLY ACCRUED TAXES OF

$481 MILLION (INCLUDING $50 MILLION OF ACCRUED

INTEREST) RELATED TO SETTLEMENTS WITH THE U.S. INTERNAL

REVENUE SERVICE IN THE FIRST AND SECOND QUARTERS OF 2007. OUR

EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE WAS LOWER IN 2006 COMPARED TO 2005,

PRIMARILY DUE TO A HIGHER PERCENTAGE OF OUR PROFITS BEING

DERIVED FROM LOWER TAX JURISDICTIONS. IN ADDITION, THE RATE FOR

2005 INCLUDED AN INCREASE TO THE TAX PROVISION OF APPROXIMATELY

$265 MILLION AS A RESULT OF THE DECISION TO REPATRIATE

NON-U.S. EARNINGS

UNDER THE AMERICAN JOBS CREATION ACT OF 2004. PARTIALLY

OFFSETTING THE DECREASE IN THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE WAS THE IMPACT

OF SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION. IN 2006, THE PHASING OUT OF THE TAX

BENEFIT FOR EXPORT SALES ONLY SLIGHTLY INCREASED THE EFFECTIVE

TAX RATE COMPARED TO 2005, GIVEN THE DECREASE IN INCOME BEFORE

TAXES.

SHARE-BASED

COMPENSATION

SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION TOTALED $952 MILLION IN 2007,

$1.4 BILLION IN 2006, AND ZERO IN 2005. SHARE-BASED

COMPENSATION WAS INCLUDED IN COST OF SALES AND OPERATING

EXPENSES. WE ADOPTED SFAS NO. 123(R) UNDER THE

MODIFIED PROSPECTIVE TRANSITION METHOD, EFFECTIVE BEGINNING IN

2006. PRIOR TO THE ADOPTION OF SFAS NO. 123(R), WE

ACCOUNTED FOR OUR EQUITY INCENTIVE PLANS UNDER THE INTRINSIC

VALUE RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT PRINCIPLES OF ACCOUNTING

PRINCIPLES BOARD (APB) OPINION NO. 25, ACCOUNTING FOR

STOCK ISSUED TO EMPLOYEES AND RELATED INTERPRETATIONS.

ACCORDINGLY, NO SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION WAS RECOGNIZED IN NET

INCOME. THE DECREASE IN SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION FROM 2006 TO

2007 WAS A RESULT OF FEWER EQUITY AWARDS VESTING IN 2007

COMPARED TO 2006.

OPERATING

ACTIVITIES

CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES IS NET INCOME ADJUSTED FOR

CERTAIN NON-CASH ITEMS AND CHANGES IN ASSETS AND LIABILITIES.

FOR 2007 COMPARED TO 2006, THE INCREASE IN CASH PROVIDED BY

OPERATING ACTIVITIES WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER NET INCOME.

CHANGES TO WORKING CAPITAL IN 2007 FROM 2006 WERE APPROXIMATELY

FLAT, WITH A DECREASE IN INVENTORY LEVELS IN 2007 COMPARED TO AN

INCREASE IN 2006, OFFSET BY HIGHER PURCHASES OF TRADING ASSETS

EXCEEDING MATURITIES. LOWER PRODUCT COSTS AND THE

RECLASSIFICATION OF NOR INVENTORY TO HELD FOR SALE IN

CONJUNCTION WITH OUR ANTICIPATED DIVESTITURE OF THE NOR FLASH

MEMORY BUSINESS CONTRIBUTED TO THE LOWER INVENTORY BALANCE IN

2007. IN COMPARISON, OUR INVENTORY INCREASED IN 2006 AS A RESULT

OF HIGHER PRODUCT COSTS. IN 2007, WE BEGAN DESIGNATING

FLOATING-RATE SECURITIZED FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS PURCHASED AFTER

2006 AS TRADING ASSETS.

FOR 2007 AND 2006, OUR TWO LARGEST CUSTOMERS ACCOUNTED FOR 35%

OF OUR NET REVENUE. IN 2007, ONE OF THESE CUSTOMERS ACCOUNTED

FOR 18% OF OUR NET REVENUE (19% IN 2006) AND ANOTHER

CUSTOMER ACCOUNTED FOR 17% OF OUR NET REVENUE (16% IN 2006).

ADDITIONALLY, THESE TWO LARGEST CUSTOMERS ACCOUNTED FOR 35% OF

OUR ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AT DECEMBER 29, 2007 AND

DECEMBER 30, 2006.

FOR 2006 COMPARED TO 2005, THE LARGEST CONTRIBUTING FACTORS TO

THE DECREASE IN CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES WERE LOWER

NET INCOME, LOWER NET MATURITIES OF TRADING ASSETS, AND CHANGES

IN THE AMOUNT OF ESTIMATED TAX PAYMENTS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A

DECREASE IN ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE BALANCES. FISCAL YEAR 2006

INCLUDED SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION CHARGES OF $1.4 BILLION

(ZERO FOR 2005).

INVESTING

ACTIVITIES

INVESTING CASH FLOWS CONSIST PRIMARILY OF CAPITAL EXPENDITURES

AND NET INVESTMENT PURCHASES, MATURITIES, AND DISPOSALS. FOR

2007 COMPARED TO 2006, THE INCREASE IN CASH USED FOR INVESTING

ACTIVITIES WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER PURCHASES OF

AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE INVESTMENTS. LOWER CAPITAL SPENDING WAS

MOSTLY OFFSET BY LOWER PROCEEDS FROM DIVESTITURES.

DURING 2007, WE PURCHASED MORE AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE INVESTMENTS,

PARTICULARLY SHORT-TERM, HIGHLY LIQUID INVESTMENTS, AS OUR LEVEL

OF CASH AVAILABLE TO INVEST INCREASED. WE RECEIVED LOWER CASH

FROM DIVESTITURES: $32 MILLION FOR ONE DIVESTITURE IN 2007

COMPARED TO $752 MILLION FOR THREE DIVESTITURES IN 2006

(SEE NOTE 13: DIVESTITURES IN PART II,

ITEM 8 OF THIS

FORM 10-K).

OUR CAPITAL EXPENDITURES WERE $5.0 BILLION IN 2007 AND WERE

PRIMARILY FOR THE RAMPING OF OUR NEW FABRICATION FACILITIES.

CAPITAL EXPENDITURES FOR FISCAL 2008 ARE CURRENTLY EXPECTED TO

BE APPROXIMATELY $5.2 BILLION, PLUS OR MINUS

$200 MILLION. CAPITAL EXPENDITURES DURING FISCAL 2008 ARE

EXPECTED TO BE FUNDED BY CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES.

CAPITAL EXPENDITURES WERE $5.9 BILLION IN 2006 AND 2005.

THE DECREASE IN CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES IN 2006

COMPARED TO 2005 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER NET MATURITIES AND

SALES OF AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE INVESTMENTS, CASH RECEIVED FROM

DIVESTITURES IN 2006, AND THE SALE OF A PORTION OF OUR

INVESTMENT IN MICRON FOR $275 MILLION. PARTIALLY OFFSETTING

THESE IMPACTS, IN 2006 WE PAID $600 MILLION IN CASH FOR OUR

EQUITY INVESTMENT IN CLEARWIRE AND $615 MILLION IN CASH FOR

OUR EQUITY INVESTMENT IN IMFT. IN ADDITION TO THE

$615 MILLION PAID IN CASH, OUR INITIAL INVESTMENT IN IMFT

OF $1.2 BILLION INCLUDED THE ISSUANCE OF $581 MILLION

IN NOTES (REFLECTED AS A FINANCING ACTIVITY) AND A CAPITAL

CONTRIBUTION OF $128 MILLION.

FINANCING

ACTIVITIES

FINANCING CASH FLOWS CONSIST PRIMARILY OF REPURCHASES AND

RETIREMENT OF COMMON STOCK, PAYMENT OF DIVIDENDS TO

STOCKHOLDERS, AND PROCEEDS FROM SALES OF SHARES THROUGH EMPLOYEE

EQUITY INCENTIVE PLANS.

FOR 2007 COMPARED TO 2006, THE LOWER CASH USED IN FINANCING

ACTIVITIES WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO AN INCREASE IN PROCEEDS FROM

SALES OF SHARES THROUGH EMPLOYEE EQUITY INCENTIVE PLANS AND A

DECREASE IN REPURCHASES AND RETIREMENT OF COMMON STOCK. PROCEEDS

FROM SALES OF SHARES THROUGH EMPLOYEE EQUITY INCENTIVE PLANS

TOTALED $3.1 BILLION IN 2007 COMPARED TO $1.0 BILLION

IN 2006, DUE TO A HIGHER VOLUME OF EXERCISES OF STOCK OPTIONS

BECAUSE OF OUR STOCK PRICE TRADING AT HIGHER LEVELS IN 2007

COMPARED TO 2006, AND A HIGHER WEIGHTED AVERAGE EXERCISE PRICE.

DURING 2007, WE REPURCHASED 111 MILLION SHARES OF COMMON

STOCK AS PART OF OUR COMMON STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM AT A COST

OF $2.75 BILLION (226 MILLION SHARES AT A COST OF

$4.6 BILLION DURING 2006). AS OF DECEMBER 29, 2007,

$14.5 BILLION REMAINED AVAILABLE FOR REPURCHASE UNDER THE

EXISTING REPURCHASE AUTHORIZATION OF $25 BILLION. WE BASE

OUR LEVEL OF STOCK REPURCHASES ON INTERNAL CASH MANAGEMENT

DECISIONS, AND THIS LEVEL MAY FLUCTUATE. OUR DIVIDEND PAYMENTS

FOR 2007 WERE $2.6 BILLION. ON JANUARY 17, 2008, OUR

BOARD OF DIRECTORS DECLARED A CASH DIVIDEND OF $0.1275 PER

COMMON SHARE FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2008, WHICH REPRESENTS A

13% INCREASE IN OUR QUARTERLY CASH DIVIDEND AMOUNT.

THE LOWER CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES IN 2006 COMPARED TO

2005 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO A DECREASE IN REPURCHASES AND

RETIREMENT OF COMMON STOCK, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY ADDITIONS TO

LONG-TERM DEBT IN 2005 OF $1.7 BILLION.

LIQUIDITY

CASH GENERATED BY OPERATIONS IS USED AS OUR PRIMARY SOURCE OF

LIQUIDITY. AS OF DECEMBER 29, 2007, WE ALSO HAD AN

INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO VALUED AT $19.3 BILLION, CONSISTING OF

CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS, FIXED-INCOME DEBT INSTRUMENTS

INCLUDED IN TRADING ASSETS, AND SHORT- AND LONG-TERM

INVESTMENTS. SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR INVESTMENTS IN DEBT

INSTRUMENTS ARE WITH A/A2 OR BETTER RATED ISSUERS, AND THE

SUBSTANTIAL MAJORITY OF THE ISSUERS ARE RATED AA/AA2 OR BETTER.

IN ADDITION TO REQUIRING ALL INVESTMENTS WITH ORIGINAL

MATURITIES OF UP TO SIX MONTHS TO BE RATED AT LEAST

A-1/P-1

BY

STANDARD & POORS/MOODYS, OUR INVESTMENT POLICY

SPECIFIES A HIGHER MINIMUM RATING FOR INVESTMENTS WITH LONGER

MATURITIES. FOR INSTANCE, INVESTMENTS WITH MATURITIES BEYOND

THREE YEARS REQUIRE A MINIMUM RATING OF AA-/AA3. GOVERNMENT

REGULATIONS IMPOSED ON INVESTMENT ALTERNATIVES OF OUR

NON-U.S. SUBSIDIARIES, OR THE ABSENCE OF A RATED

COUNTERPARTIES IN CERTAIN COUNTRIES, RESULT IN SOME MINOR

EXCEPTIONS, WHICH ARE REVIEWED ANNUALLY BY THE FINANCE COMMITTEE

OF OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS. AS OF DECEMBER 29, 2007,

$9.5 BILLION OF OUR PORTFOLIO HAD A REMAINING MATURITY OF

LESS THAN THREE MONTHS, AND A SUBSTANTIAL MAJORITY OF OUR

INVESTMENTS HAVE REMAINING MATURITIES OF TWO YEARS OR LESS. IN

2007, WE DID NOT RECOGNIZE ANY OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENTS

ON OUR PORTFOLIO OF AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE INVESTMENTS. DURING 2007,

$24 MILLION OF UNREALIZED LOSSES WERE RECOGNIZED RELATED TO

DEBT INSTRUMENTS CLASSIFIED AS TRADING ASSETS, AND AS OF

DECEMBER 29, 2007, $62 MILLION OF LOSSES WERE

UNREALIZED RELATED TO DEBT INSTRUMENTS CLASSIFIED AS

AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE. SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR UNREALIZED LOSSES

CAN BE ATTRIBUTED TO FAIR VALUE FLUCTUATIONS IN AN UNSTABLE

CREDIT ENVIRONMENT. AS OF DECEMBER, 29, 2007, ONLY

$125 MILLION OF OUR INVESTMENTS DID NOT COMPLY WITH OUR

CREDIT GUIDELINES, DUE TO RATING DOWNGRADES AFTER THE INITIAL

INVESTMENT. HOWEVER, THESE INVESTMENTS CONTINUE TO BE RATED AS

INVESTMENT-GRADE SECURITIES.

OUR PORTFOLIO INCLUDES $1.8 BILLION OF ASSET-BACKED

SECURITIES COLLATERALIZED BY FIRST-LIEN MORTGAGES, CREDIT CARD

DEBT, STUDENT LOANS, AND AUTO LOANS. AS OF DECEMBER 29,

2007, APPROXIMATELY ONE-THIRD OF OUR ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES

WERE COLLATERALIZED BY FIRST-LIEN MORTGAGES. THE MORTGAGE-BACKED

SECURITIES HAVE AN 80% LOAN-TO-VALUE RATIO ON AVERAGE, AND THEY

INCLUDE ONLY FIRST-LIEN MORTGAGES. THE AVERAGE SUBORDINATION

LEVEL OF THE SECURITIES THAT WE HELD AS OF DECEMBER 29,

2007 WAS 27% (RANGING FROM 18% TO 40%), IMPLYING THAT THE

MORTGAGE POOL WOULD HAVE TO SUFFER LOSSES BEYOND THOSE LEVELS

BEFORE OUR SECURITIES EXPERIENCE REALIZED LOSSES. IN 2007, OUR

ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES EXPERIENCED UNREALIZED FAIR VALUE

DECLINES TOTALING $42 MILLION OF WHICH $19 MILLION WAS

RECOGNIZED IN OUR INCOME STATEMENT FOR THOSE CLASSIFIED UNDER

TRADING ASSETS. AS OF DECEMBER 29, 2007, ALL OF OUR

INVESTMENTS IN ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES WERE RATED AAA/AAA, AND

THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE REMAINING MATURITY WAS LESS THAN TWO YEARS.

WE HAVE THE INTENT AND ABILITY TO HOLD OUR DEBT INVESTMENTS FOR

A SUFFICIENT PERIOD OF TIME TO ALLOW FOR RECOVERY OF THE

PRINCIPAL AMOUNTS INVESTED.

WE CONTINUALLY MONITOR THE CREDIT RISK IN OUR PORTFOLIO AND

MITIGATE OUR CREDIT AND INTEREST RATE EXPOSURES IN ACCORDANCE

WITH THE POLICIES APPROVED BY OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS. WE INTEND

TO CONTINUE TO CLOSELY MONITOR FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS IN THE CREDIT

MARKETS AND MAKE APPROPRIATE CHANGES TO OUR INVESTMENT POLICY AS

DEEMED NECESSARY. BASED ON OUR ABILITY TO LIQUIDATE OUR

INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO AND OUR EXPECTED OPERATING CASH FLOWS, WE

DO NOT ANTICIPATE ANY LIQUIDITY CONSTRAINTS AS A RESULT OF THE

CURRENT CREDIT ENVIRONMENT.

ANOTHER POTENTIAL SOURCE OF LIQUIDITY IS AUTHORIZED BORROWINGS,

INCLUDING COMMERCIAL PAPER, OF UP TO $3.0 BILLION. THERE

WERE NO BORROWINGS UNDER OUR COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAM DURING

2007. WE ALSO HAVE AN AUTOMATIC SHELF REGISTRATION ON FILE WITH

THE SEC PURSUANT TO WHICH WE MAY OFFER AN INDETERMINATE AMOUNT

OF DEBT, EQUITY, AND OTHER SECURITIES.

WE BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE THE FINANCIAL RESOURCES NEEDED TO MEET

BUSINESS REQUIREMENTS FOR THE NEXT 12 MONTHS, INCLUDING

CAPITAL EXPENDITURES FOR THE EXPANSION OR UPGRADING OF WORLDWIDE

MANUFACTURING AND ASSEMBLY AND TEST CAPACITY, WORKING CAPITAL

REQUIREMENTS, THE DIVIDEND PROGRAM, POTENTIAL STOCK REPURCHASES,

AND POTENTIAL ACQUISITIONS OR STRATEGIC INVESTMENTS.

WERE NOT RECORDED AS LIABILITIES ON OUR CONSOLIDATED BALANCE

SHEET AS OF DECEMBER 29, 2007, AS WE HAD NOT YET RECEIVED

THE RELATED GOODS OR TAKEN TITLE TO THE PROPERTY. CAPITAL

PURCHASE OBLIGATIONS DECREASED FROM $3.3 BILLION AT

DECEMBER 30, 2006 TO $2.3 BILLION AT DECEMBER 29,

2007, PRIMARILY DUE TO THE TIMING OF THE RAMP OF OUR LATEST

SILICON PROCESS TECHNOLOGY.

2

OTHER PURCHASE OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS INCLUDE PAYMENTS

DUE UNDER VARIOUS TYPES OF LICENSES, AGREEMENTS TO PURCHASE RAW

MATERIALS OR OTHER GOODS, AS WELL AS PAYMENTS DUE UNDER

NON-CONTINGENT FUNDING OBLIGATIONS. FUNDING OBLIGATIONS INCLUDE,

FOR EXAMPLE, AGREEMENTS TO FUND VARIOUS PROJECTS WITH OTHER

COMPANIES.

3

AMOUNTS REPRESENT TOTAL ANTICIPATED CASH PAYMENTS, INCLUDING

ANTICIPATED INTEREST PAYMENTS THAT ARE NOT RECORDED ON THE

CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS AND THE SHORT-TERM PORTION OF THE

OBLIGATION. ANY FUTURE SETTLEMENT OF CONVERTIBLE DEBT WOULD

REDUCE ANTICIPATED INTEREST AND/OR PRINCIPAL PAYMENTS. AMOUNTS

EXCLUDE FAIR VALUE ADJUSTMENTS SUCH AS DISCOUNTS OR PREMIUMS

THAT AFFECT THE AMOUNT RECORDED ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE

SHEETS.

4

OTHER LONG-TERM LIABILITIES INCLUDES INCOME TAXES PAYABLE.

LONG-TERM INCOME TAXES PAYABLE INCLUDE UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS,

REDUCED BY THE ASSOCIATED FEDERAL DEDUCTION FOR STATE TAXES AND

NON-U.S.

TAX

CREDITS, AND MAY ALSO INCLUDE OTHER LONG-TERM TAX LIABILITIES

THAT ARE NOT UNCERTAIN BUT HAVE NOT YET BEEN PAID. WE ARE UNABLE

TO RELIABLY ESTIMATE THE TIMING OF FUTURE PAYMENTS RELATED TO

UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS; THEREFORE, $785 MILLION OF INCOME

TAXES PAYABLE HAS BEEN EXCLUDED FROM THE TABLE ABOVE.

5

TOTAL EXCLUDES CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS ALREADY RECORDED ON

THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET AS CURRENT LIABILITIES (EXCEPT

FOR THE

SHORT-TERM

PORTION OF THE LONG-TERM DEBT AND OTHER LONG-TERM LIABILITIES)

AND CERTAIN PURCHASE OBLIGATIONS, WHICH ARE DISCUSSED BELOW.

CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS FOR PURCHASES OF GOODS OR SERVICES

GENERALLY INCLUDE AGREEMENTS THAT ARE ENFORCEABLE AND LEGALLY

BINDING ON INTEL AND THAT SPECIFY ALL SIGNIFICANT TERMS,

INCLUDING FIXED OR MINIMUM QUANTITIES TO BE PURCHASED; FIXED,

MINIMUM, OR VARIABLE PRICE PROVISIONS; AND THE APPROXIMATE

TIMING OF THE TRANSACTION. THE TABLE ABOVE ALSO INCLUDES

AGREEMENTS TO PURCHASE RAW MATERIALS THAT HAVE CANCELLATION

PROVISIONS REQUIRING LITTLE OR NO PAYMENT. THE AMOUNTS UNDER

SUCH CONTRACTS ARE INCLUDED IN THE TABLE ABOVE BECAUSE

MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT CANCELLATION OF THESE CONTRACTS IS

UNLIKELY AND EXPECTS TO MAKE FUTURE CASH PAYMENTS ACCORDING TO

THE CONTRACT TERMS OR IN SIMILAR AMOUNTS FOR SIMILAR MATERIALS.

FOR OTHER OBLIGATIONS WITH CANCELLATION PROVISIONS, THE AMOUNTS

INCLUDED IN THE TABLE ABOVE WERE LIMITED TO THE NON-CANCELABLE

PORTION OF THE AGREEMENT TERMS,

AND/OR

THE

MINIMUM CANCELLATION FEE.

WE HAVE ENTERED INTO CERTAIN AGREEMENTS FOR THE PURCHASE OF RAW

MATERIALS OR OTHER GOODS THAT SPECIFY MINIMUM PRICES AND

QUANTITIES THAT ARE BASED ON A PERCENTAGE OF THE TOTAL AVAILABLE

MARKET OR BASED ON A PERCENTAGE OF OUR FUTURE PURCHASING

REQUIREMENTS. DUE TO THE UNCERTAINTY OF THE FUTURE MARKET AND

OUR FUTURE PURCHASING REQUIREMENTS, OBLIGATIONS UNDER THESE

AGREEMENTS ARE NOT INCLUDED IN THE TABLE ABOVE. WE ESTIMATE OUR

OBLIGATION UNDER THESE AGREEMENTS AS OF DECEMBER 29, 2007

TO BE APPROXIMATELY AS FOLLOWS: LESS THAN ONE

YEAR$331 MILLION; ONE TO THREE

YEARS$377 MILLION; THREE TO FIVE

YEARS$2 MILLION; MORE THAN FIVE YEARSZERO. OUR

PURCHASE ORDERS FOR OTHER PRODUCTS ARE BASED ON OUR CURRENT

MANUFACTURING NEEDS AND ARE FULFILLED BY OUR VENDORS WITHIN

SHORT TIME HORIZONS. IN ADDITION, SOME OF OUR PURCHASE ORDERS

REPRESENT AUTHORIZATIONS TO PURCHASE RATHER THAN BINDING

AGREEMENTS.

CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS THAT ARE CONTINGENT UPON THE ACHIEVEMENT

OF CERTAIN MILESTONES ARE NOT INCLUDED IN THE TABLE ABOVE. THESE

OBLIGATIONS INCLUDE MILESTONE-BASED CO-MARKETING AGREEMENTS,

CONTINGENT FUNDING/PAYMENT OBLIGATIONS, AND MILESTONE-BASED

EQUITY INVESTMENT FUNDING. THESE ARRANGEMENTS ARE NOT CONSIDERED

CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS UNTIL THE MILESTONE IS MET BY THE THIRD

PARTY. AS OF DECEMBER 29, 2007, ASSUMING THAT ALL FUTURE

MILESTONES ARE MET, ADDITIONAL REQUIRED PAYMENTS WOULD BE

APPROXIMATELY $254 MILLION.

FOR THE MAJORITY OF RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS GRANTED, THE NUMBER

OF SHARES ISSUED ON THE DATE THE RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS VEST IS

NET OF THE STATUTORY WITHHOLDING REQUIREMENTS THAT ARE PAID BY

INTEL ON BEHALF OF OUR EMPLOYEES. THE OBLIGATION TO PAY THE

RELATIVE TAXING AUTHORITY IS NOT INCLUDED IN THE TABLE ABOVE, AS

THE AMOUNT IS CONTINGENT UPON CONTINUED EMPLOYMENT. IN ADDITION,

THE AMOUNT OF THE OBLIGATION IS UNKNOWN, AS IT IS BASED IN PART

ON THE MARKET PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK WHEN THE AWARDS VEST.

THE EXPECTED TIMING OF PAYMENTS OF THE OBLIGATIONS ABOVE ARE

ESTIMATES BASED ON CURRENT INFORMATION. TIMING OF PAYMENTS AND

ACTUAL AMOUNTS PAID MAY BE DIFFERENT, DEPENDING ON THE TIME OF

RECEIPT OF GOODS OR SERVICES, OR CHANGES TO

AGREED-UPON

AMOUNTS FOR SOME OBLIGATIONS. AMOUNTS DISCLOSED AS CONTINGENT OR

MILESTONE-BASED OBLIGATIONS ARE DEPENDENT ON THE ACHIEVEMENT OF

THE MILESTONES OR THE OCCURRENCE OF THE CONTINGENT EVENTS AND

CAN VARY SIGNIFICANTLY.

WE HAVE A CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATION TO PURCHASE THE OUTPUT OF IMFT

AND IMFS IN PROPORTION TO OUR INVESTMENTS, CURRENTLY 49% IN EACH

OF THESE VENTURES. HOWEVER, IMFS IS IN ITS CONSTRUCTION PHASE

AND HAS HAD NO PRODUCTION TO DATE. SEE NOTE 19.

VENTURES IN PART II, ITEM 8 OF THIS

FORM 10-K.

ADDITIONALLY, WE HAVE ENTERED INTO VARIOUS CONTRACTUAL

COMMITMENTS IN RELATION TO OUR INVESTMENTS IN IMFT AND IMFS.

SOME OF THESE COMMITMENTS ARE WITH MICRON, AND SOME ARE DIRECTLY

WITH IMFT OR IMFS. THE FOLLOWING ARE THE SIGNIFICANT CONTRACTUAL

COMMITMENTS.



SUBJECT TO CERTAIN CONDITIONS, INTEL AND MICRON EACH AGREED TO

CONTRIBUTE UP TO APPROXIMATELY $1.4 BILLION FOR IMFT AND UP

TO APPROXIMATELY $1.7 BILLION FOR IMFS IN THE THREE YEARS

FOLLOWING THE INITIAL CAPITAL CONTRIBUTIONS. OF THESE AMOUNTS,

AS OF DECEMBER 29, 2007, OUR REMAINING COMMITMENTS WERE

APPROXIMATELY $260 MILLION FOR IMFT AND APPROXIMATELY

$1.5 BILLION FOR IMFS.



WE ALSO HAVE SEVERAL AGREEMENTS WITH MICRON RELATED TO

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS, AND R&D FUNDING RELATED TO

NAND FLASH MANUFACTURING AND IMFT. SEE NOTE 19.

OPERATIONS MAY ALSO BE AFFECTED BY THE AMOUNT, TYPE, AND

VALUATION OF SHARE-BASED AWARDS GRANTED AS WELL AS THE AMOUNT OF

AWARDS CANCELLED DUE TO EMPLOYEE TURNOVER AND THE TIMING OF

AWARD EXERCISES BY EMPLOYEES. WE ARE FOCUSING ON EFFORTS TO

IMPROVE OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCY AND REDUCE SPENDING THAT MAY

RESULT IN SEVERAL ACTIONS THAT COULD HAVE AN IMPACT ON EXPENSE

LEVELS AND GROSS MARGIN. IN ADDITION TO THE VARIOUS IMPORTANT

FACTORS DISCUSSED ABOVE, A NUMBER OF OTHER IMPORTANT FACTORS

COULD CAUSE ACTUAL RESULTS TO DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM OUR

EXPECTATIONS. SEE THE RISKS DESCRIBED IN RISK

FACTORS IN PART I, ITEM 1A OF THIS

FORM 10-K.

OUR EXPECTATIONS FOR 2008 ARE AS FOLLOWS.



GROSS MARGIN.

57% PLUS OR MINUS A FEW POINTS. THE

57% MIDPOINT IS HIGHER THAN OUR 2007 GROSS MARGIN OF 51.9%,

PRIMARILY DUE TO EXPECTED LOWER UNIT COSTS AND LOWER

START-UP

COSTS, AND TO A LESSER EXTENT, THE DIVESTITURE OF LOWER MARGIN

BUSINESSES.



CAPITAL SPENDING.

APPROXIMATELY $5.2 BILLION,

PLUS OR MINUS $200 MILLION, COMPARED TO $5.0 BILLION

IN 2007.



DEPRECIATION.

APPROXIMATELY $4.4 BILLION, PLUS

OR MINUS $100 MILLION, COMPARED TO $4.5 BILLION IN

2007.



TOTAL SPENDING.

SPENDING ON R&D, PLUS

MARKETING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES IN 2008 IS

EXPECTED TO BE APPROXIMATELY $11.4 BILLION. THE EXPECTATION

FOR TOTAL SPENDING IN 2008 IS HIGHER THAN OUR 2007 SPENDING OF

$11.2 BILLION, AS PROCESS DEVELOPMENT ENGINEERS TRANSITION

FROM 45NM

START-UP

ACTIVITIES TO 32NM DEVELOPMENT, CAUSING A MOVEMENT OF SPENDING

FROM COST OF SALES TO R&D.



RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT SPENDING.

APPROXIMATELY

$5.9 BILLION.



TAX RATE.

APPROXIMATELY 31%. THE ESTIMATED EFFECTIVE

TAX RATE IS BASED ON TAX LAW IN EFFECT AT DECEMBER 29, 2007

AND CURRENT EXPECTED INCOME.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

ITEM 7A.  QUANTITATIVE

AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

WE ARE EXPOSED TO FINANCIAL MARKET RISKS, INCLUDING CHANGES IN

CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES, INTEREST RATES, AND EQUITY PRICES. WE

USE DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS PRIMARILY TO MITIGATE THESE

RISKS. ALL OF THE POTENTIAL CHANGES NOTED BELOW ARE BASED ON

SENSITIVITY ANALYSES PERFORMED ON OUR FINANCIAL POSITIONS AT

DECEMBER 29, 2007 AND DECEMBER 30, 2006. ACTUAL

RESULTS MAY DIFFER MATERIALLY.

CURRENCY

EXCHANGE RATES

WE GENERALLY HEDGE CURRENCY RISKS OF

NON-U.S.-DOLLAR-DENOMINATED

INVESTMENTS IN DEBT INSTRUMENTS WITH OFFSETTING CURRENCY

BORROWINGS, CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS, OR CURRENCY INTEREST

RATE SWAPS. GAINS AND LOSSES ON THESE

NON-U.S.-CURRENCY

INVESTMENTS WOULD GENERALLY BE OFFSET BY CORRESPONDING LOSSES

AND GAINS ON THE RELATED HEDGING INSTRUMENTS, RESULTING IN

NEGLIGIBLE NET EXPOSURE.

A MAJORITY OF OUR REVENUE, EXPENSE, AND CAPITAL PURCHASING

ACTIVITIES ARE TRANSACTED IN U.S. DOLLARS. HOWEVER, CERTAIN

OPERATING EXPENDITURES AND CAPITAL PURCHASES ARE INCURRED IN OR

EXPOSED TO OTHER CURRENCIES, PRIMARILY THE EURO, THE ISRAELI

SHEKEL, AND THE CHINESE YUAN. TO PROTECT AGAINST REDUCTIONS IN

VALUE AND THE VOLATILITY OF FUTURE CASH FLOWS CAUSED BY CHANGES

IN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES, WE HAVE ESTABLISHED BALANCE SHEET

AND ANTICIPATED TRANSACTION RISK MANAGEMENT PROGRAMS. CURRENCY

FORWARD CONTRACTS AND CURRENCY OPTIONS ARE GENERALLY UTILIZED IN

THESE HEDGING PROGRAMS. OUR HEDGING PROGRAMS REDUCE, BUT DO NOT

ALWAYS ENTIRELY ELIMINATE, THE IMPACT OF CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE

MOVEMENTS (SEE RISK FACTORS IN PART II, ITEM 1A OF

THIS FORM 10-K). WE CONSIDERED THE HISTORICAL TRENDS IN CURRENCY

EXCHANGE RATES AND DETERMINED THAT IT WAS REASONABLY POSSIBLE

THAT A WEIGHTED AVERAGE ADVERSE CHANGE OF 15% IN CURRENCY

EXCHANGE RATES COULD BE EXPERIENCED IN THE NEAR TERM. SUCH AN

ADVERSE CHANGE, AFTER TAKING INTO ACCOUNT HEDGES AND OFFSETTING

POSITIONS, WOULD HAVE RESULTED IN AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON INCOME

BEFORE TAXES OF LESS THAN $35 MILLION AT THE END OF 2007

AND 2006.

INTEREST

RATES

WE ARE EXPOSED TO INTEREST RATE RISK RELATED TO OUR INVESTMENT

PORTFOLIO AND DEBT ISSUANCES. THE PRIMARY OBJECTIVE OF OUR

INVESTMENTS IN DEBT INSTRUMENTS IS TO PRESERVE PRINCIPAL WHILE

MAXIMIZING YIELDS. TO ACHIEVE THIS OBJECTIVE, THE RETURNS ON ALL

OF OUR INVESTMENTS IN DEBT INSTRUMENTS ARE GENERALLY BASED ON

THREE-MONTH LIBOR, OR, IF THE MATURITIES ARE LONGER THAN THREE

MONTHS, THE RETURNS ARE GENERALLY SWAPPED INTO U.S. DOLLAR

THREE-MONTH LIBOR-BASED RETURNS. WE CONSIDERED THE HISTORICAL

VOLATILITY OF THE INTEREST RATES EXPERIENCED IN PRIOR YEARS AND

THE DURATION OF OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO AND DEBT ISSUANCES, AND

DETERMINED THAT IT WAS REASONABLY POSSIBLE THAT AN ADVERSE

CHANGE OF 80 BASIS POINTS (0.80%), APPROXIMATELY 17% OF THE

RATE AT DECEMBER 29, 2007 (15% OF THE RATE AT

DECEMBER 30, 2006), COULD BE EXPERIENCED IN THE NEAR TERM.

A HYPOTHETICAL 0.80% DECREASE IN INTEREST RATES, AFTER TAKING

INTO ACCOUNT HEDGES AND OFFSETTING POSITIONS, WOULD HAVE

RESULTED IN A DECREASE IN THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR NET INVESTMENT

POSITION OF APPROXIMATELY $65 MILLION AS OF

DECEMBER 29, 2007 AND $50 MILLION AS OF

DECEMBER 30, 2006. THE DECLINE REFLECTS ONLY THE DIRECT

IMPACT OF THE CHANGE IN INTEREST RATES. OTHER ECONOMIC

VARIABLES, SUCH AS EQUITY MARKET FLUCTUATIONS AND CHANGES IN

RELATIVE CREDIT RISK, COULD RESULT IN A SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER

DECLINE IN OUR NET INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO.

EQUITY

PRICES

OUR MARKETABLE INVESTMENTS INCLUDE MARKETABLE EQUITY SECURITIES,

EQUITY DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS SUCH AS WARRANTS AND OPTIONS, AND

MARKETABLE EQUITY METHOD INVESTMENTS. TO THE EXTENT THAT OUR

MARKETABLE EQUITY SECURITIES HAVE STRATEGIC VALUE, WE TYPICALLY

DO NOT ATTEMPT TO REDUCE OR ELIMINATE OUR MARKET EXPOSURE;

HOWEVER, FOR OUR INVESTMENTS IN STRATEGIC EQUITY DERIVATIVE

INSTRUMENTS, INCLUDING WARRANTS, WE MAY ENTER INTO TRANSACTIONS

TO REDUCE OR ELIMINATE THE MARKET RISKS. FOR SECURITIES THAT WE

NO LONGER CONSIDER STRATEGIC, WE EVALUATE LEGAL, MARKET, AND

ECONOMIC FACTORS IN OUR DECISION ON THE TIMING OF DISPOSAL AND

WHETHER IT IS POSSIBLE AND APPROPRIATE TO HEDGE THE EQUITY

MARKET RISK.

THE MARKETABLE EQUITY SECURITIES INCLUDED IN TRADING ASSETS ARE

HELD TO GENERATE RETURNS THAT OFFSET CHANGES IN LIABILITIES

RELATED TO THE EQUITY MARKET RISK OF CERTAIN DEFERRED

COMPENSATION ARRANGEMENTS. THE GAINS AND LOSSES FROM CHANGES IN

FAIR VALUE OF THESE EQUITY SECURITIES ARE GENERALLY OFFSET BY

THE GAINS AND LOSSES ON THE RELATED LIABILITIES, RESULTING IN A

NET EXPOSURE OF LESS THAN $10 MILLION AS OF

DECEMBER 29, 2007 AND DECEMBER 30, 2006, ASSUMING A

REASONABLY POSSIBLE DECLINE IN MARKET PRICES OF APPROXIMATELY

10% IN THE NEAR TERM.

AS OF DECEMBER 29, 2007, THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR MARKETABLE

EQUITY SECURITIES AND EQUITY DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS, INCLUDING

HEDGING POSITIONS, WAS $1.0 BILLION ($427 MILLION AS

OF DECEMBER 30, 2006). OUR INVESTMENTS IN VMWARE AND MICRON

CONSTITUTED 92% OF OUR MARKETABLE EQUITY SECURITIES AS OF

DECEMBER 29, 2007, AND WERE CARRIED AT A FAIR MARKET VALUE

OF $794 MILLION AND $123 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. OUR

MARKETABLE EQUITY METHOD INVESTMENT HAD A CARRYING VALUE OF

$508 MILLION AND A FAIR VALUE OF $522 MILLION AS OF

DECEMBER 29, 2007.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

TO ASSESS THE MARKET PRICE SENSITIVITY OF OUR MARKETABLE EQUITY

INVESTMENTS, WE ANALYZED THE HISTORICAL MOVEMENTS OVER THE PAST

SEVERAL YEARS OF HIGH-TECHNOLOGY STOCK INDICES THAT WE

CONSIDERED APPROPRIATE. FOR OUR INVESTMENTS IN COMPANIES THAT

HAVE BEEN PUBLICLY TRADED FOR ONLY A LIMITED TIME, WE ANALYZED

THE IMPLIED VOLATILITY OF THE RELATED COMPANY BASED ON FREELY

TRADED OPTIONS. OUR MARKETABLE EQUITY METHOD INVESTMENT IS

EXCLUDED FROM OUR ANALYSIS, AS THE CARRYING VALUE DOES NOT

FLUCTUATE BASED ON MARKET PRICE CHANGES. THEREFORE, THE

POTENTIAL FAIR VALUE DECLINE WOULD NOT BE INDICATIVE OF THE

IMPACT ON OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, UNLESS AN

OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENT WAS DEEMED NECESSARY. BASED ON

OUR SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS, WE ESTIMATED THAT IT WAS REASONABLY

POSSIBLE THAT THE PRICES OF THE STOCKS OF OUR MARKETABLE EQUITY

SECURITIES COULD EXPERIENCE A LOSS OF 55% IN THE NEAR TERM (30%

AS OF DECEMBER 30, 2006). ASSUMING A LOSS OF 55% IN MARKET

PRICES, AND AFTER REFLECTING THE IMPACT OF HEDGES AND OFFSETTING

POSITIONS, THE AGGREGATE VALUE OF OUR MARKETABLE EQUITY

INVESTMENTS COULD DECREASE BY APPROXIMATELY $565 MILLION,

BASED ON THE VALUE AS OF DECEMBER 29, 2007 (A DECREASE IN

VALUE OF $134 MILLION, BASED ON THE VALUE AS OF

DECEMBER 30, 2006 USING AN ASSUMED LOSS OF 30%). THIS

ESTIMATE IS NOT NECESSARILY INDICATIVE OF FUTURE PERFORMANCE,

AND ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER MATERIALLY. THE INCREASE IN

EXPOSURE FROM DECEMBER 30, 2006 TO DECEMBER 29, 2007

IS DUE TO OUR PURCHASE OF VMWARE DURING 2007, ITS STOCK PRICE

VOLATILITY, AND THE WEIGHT OF OUR INVESTMENT IN VMWARE IN

RELATION TO OUR TOTAL MARKETABLE EQUITY SECURITIES.

MANY OF THE SAME FACTORS THAT COULD RESULT IN AN ADVERSE

MOVEMENT OF EQUITY MARKET PRICES AFFECT OUR NON-MARKETABLE

EQUITY INVESTMENTS, ALTHOUGH WE CANNOT QUANTIFY THE IMPACT

DIRECTLY. SUCH A MOVEMENT AND THE UNDERLYING ECONOMIC CONDITIONS

WOULD NEGATIVELY AFFECT THE PROSPECTS OF THE COMPANIES WE INVEST

IN, THEIR ABILITY TO RAISE ADDITIONAL CAPITAL, AND THE

LIKELIHOOD OF OUR BEING ABLE TO REALIZE VALUE IN OUR INVESTMENTS

THROUGH LIQUIDITY EVENTS SUCH AS INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERINGS,

MERGERS, AND PRIVATE SALES. THESE TYPES OF INVESTMENTS INVOLVE A

GREAT DEAL OF RISK, AND THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT ANY

SPECIFIC COMPANY WILL GROW OR BECOME SUCCESSFUL; CONSEQUENTLY,

WE COULD LOSE ALL OR PART OF OUR INVESTMENT. OUR NON-MARKETABLE

EQUITY INVESTMENTS, EXCLUDING INVESTMENTS ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER

THE EQUITY METHOD, HAD A CARRYING AMOUNT OF $805 MILLION AS

OF DECEMBER 29, 2007 ($733 MILLION AS OF

DECEMBER 30, 2006). THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF THESE

INVESTMENTS APPROXIMATED FAIR VALUE AS OF DECEMBER 29, 2007

AND DECEMBER 30, 2006. AS OF DECEMBER 29, 2007, THE

CARRYING AMOUNT OF OUR NON-MARKETABLE EQUITY METHOD INVESTMENTS

WAS $2.6 BILLION ($2.0 BILLION AS OF DECEMBER 30,

2006) AND CONSISTED PRIMARILY OF OUR INVESTMENT IN IMFT OF

$2.2 BILLION ($1.3 BILLION AS OF DECEMBER 30,

2006).

OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDE THE ACCOUNTS OF

INTEL AND OUR WHOLLY OWNED SUBSIDIARIES. INTERCOMPANY ACCOUNTS

AND TRANSACTIONS HAVE BEEN ELIMINATED. WE USE THE EQUITY METHOD

TO ACCOUNT FOR EQUITY INVESTMENTS IN INSTANCES IN WHICH WE OWN

COMMON STOCK OR SIMILAR INTERESTS (AS DESCRIBED BY THE EMERGING

ISSUES TASK FORCE (EITF) ISSUE

NO. 02-14,

WHETHER AN INVESTOR SHOULD APPLY THE EQUITY METHOD OF

ACCOUNTING TO INVESTMENTS OTHER THAN COMMON STOCK), AND

HAVE THE ABILITY TO EXERCISE SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE, BUT NOT

CONTROL, OVER THE INVESTEE.

THE U.S. DOLLAR IS THE FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY FOR INTEL AND

OUR SUBSIDIARIES; THEREFORE, THERE IS NO TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENT

RECORDED THROUGH ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS).

MONETARY ACCOUNTS DENOMINATED IN

ACCOUNTING POLICIES

USE OF

ESTIMATES

THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN CONFORMITY WITH

U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES REQUIRES US

TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS THAT AFFECT THE AMOUNTS REPORTED

IN OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND THE ACCOMPANYING

NOTES. THE ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES THAT REQUIRE OUR MOST

SIGNIFICANT, DIFFICULT, AND SUBJECTIVE JUDGMENTS INCLUDE.



THE VALUATION OF NON-MARKETABLE EQUITY INVESTMENTS;



THE ASSESSMENT OF RECOVERABILITY OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS;



THE RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT OF CURRENT AND DEFERRED INCOME

TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES (INCLUDING THE MEASUREMENT OF

UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS);



THE VALUATION OF INVENTORY; AND



THE VALUATION AND RECOGNITION OF SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION.

THE ACTUAL RESULTS THAT WE EXPERIENCE MAY DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM

OUR ESTIMATES.

CASH

AND CASH EQUIVALENTS

WE CONSIDER ALL HIGHLY LIQUID DEBT INSTRUMENTS WITH ORIGINAL

MATURITIES FROM THE DATE OF PURCHASE OF APPROXIMATELY THREE

MONTHS OR LESS AS CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS.

TRADING

ASSETS

INVESTMENTS THAT WE DESIGNATE AS TRADING ASSETS ARE REPORTED AT

FAIR VALUE, WITH GAINS OR LOSSES RESULTING FROM CHANGES IN FAIR

VALUE RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS. OUR TRADING ASSET INVESTMENTS

INCLUDE.



MARKETABLE DEBT INSTRUMENTS

WHEN THE INTEREST RATE OR

FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATE RISK IS HEDGED AT INCEPTION BY A RELATED

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENT. WE RECORD THE GAINS OR LOSSES OF THESE

INVESTMENTS ARISING FROM CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE DUE TO INTEREST

RATE AND CURRENCY MARKET FLUCTUATIONS AND CREDIT MARKET

VOLATILITY, OFFSET BY LOSSES OR GAINS ON THE RELATED DERIVATIVE

INSTRUMENTS, IN INTEREST AND OTHER, NET. WE DESIGNATE

FLOATING-RATE SECURITIZED FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, SUCH AS

ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES, PURCHASED AFTER DECEMBER 30, 2006

AS TRADING ASSETS.



EQUITY SECURITIES OFFSETTING DEFERRED COMPENSATION

WHEN

THE INVESTMENTS SEEK TO OFFSET CHANGES IN LIABILITIES RELATED TO

EQUITY AND OTHER MARKET RISKS OF CERTAIN DEFERRED COMPENSATION

ARRANGEMENTS. WE OFFSET THE GAINS OR LOSSES FROM CHANGES IN FAIR

VALUE OF THESE EQUITY SECURITIES AGAINST LOSSES OR GAINS ON THE

RELATED LIABILITIES AND INCLUDE THEM IN INTEREST AND OTHER, NET.



MARKETABLE EQUITY SECURITIES

WHEN WE DEEM THE INVESTMENTS

NOT TO BE STRATEGIC IN NATURE AT THE TIME OF ORIGINAL

CLASSIFICATION, AND HAVE THE ABILITY AND INTENT TO MITIGATE

EQUITY MARKET RISK THROUGH THE SALE OR THE USE OF DERIVATIVE

INSTRUMENTS. FOR THESE MARKETABLE EQUITY SECURITIES, WE INCLUDE

GAINS OR LOSSES FROM CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE, PRIMARILY OFFSET BY

LOSSES OR GAINS ON RELATED DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS, IN GAINS

(LOSSES) ON EQUITY INVESTMENTS, NET.

DEBT

INSTRUMENT INVESTMENTS

WE CLASSIFY DEBT INSTRUMENTS WITH ORIGINAL MATURITIES AT THE

DATE OF PURCHASE GREATER THAN APPROXIMATELY THREE MONTHS AND

REMAINING MATURITIES LESS THAN ONE YEAR AS SHORT-TERM

INVESTMENTS. WE CLASSIFY DEBT INSTRUMENTS WITH REMAINING

MATURITIES GREATER THAN ONE YEAR AS OTHER LONG-TERM INVESTMENTS.

WE ACCOUNT FOR COST BASIS LOAN PARTICIPATION NOTES AT AMORTIZED

COST AND CLASSIFY THEM AS SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS AND OTHER

LONG-TERM INVESTMENTS BASED ON STATED MATURITIES.

AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE

INVESTMENTS

INVESTMENTS THAT WE DESIGNATE AS AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE ARE REPORTED

AT FAIR VALUE, WITH UNREALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES, NET OF TAX,

RECORDED IN ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS). WE

BASE THE COST OF THE INVESTMENT SOLD ON THE SPECIFIC

IDENTIFICATION METHOD. OUR AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE INVESTMENTS

INCLUDE.



MARKETABLE DEBT INSTRUMENTS

WHEN THE INTEREST RATE AND

FOREIGN CURRENCY RISKS ARE NOT GENERALLY HEDGED AT INCEPTION OF

THE INVESTMENT OR WHEN OUR DESIGNATION FOR TRADING ASSETS IS NOT

MET. WE HOLD THESE DEBT INSTRUMENTS TO GENERATE A RETURN

COMMENSURATE WITH THREE-MONTH LIBOR. WE RECORD THE INTEREST

INCOME AND REALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES ON THE SALE OF THESE

INSTRUMENTS IN INTEREST AND OTHER, NET.



MARKETABLE EQUITY SECURITIES

WHEN THE INVESTMENTS ARE

CONSIDERED STRATEGIC IN NATURE AT THE TIME OF ORIGINAL

CLASSIFICATION. WE ACQUIRE THESE EQUITY INVESTMENTS FOR THE

PROMOTION OF BUSINESS AND STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES. TO THE EXTENT

THAT THESE INVESTMENTS CONTINUE TO HAVE STRATEGIC VALUE, WE

TYPICALLY DO NOT ATTEMPT TO REDUCE OR ELIMINATE THE INHERENT

EQUITY MARKET RISKS THROUGH HEDGING ACTIVITIES. WE RECORD THE

REALIZED GAINS OR LOSSES ON THE SALE OR EXCHANGE OF MARKETABLE

EQUITY SECURITIES IN GAINS (LOSSES) ON EQUITY INVESTMENTS, NET.

NON-MARKETABLE

AND OTHER EQUITY INVESTMENTS

WE ACCOUNT FOR NON-MARKETABLE AND OTHER EQUITY INVESTMENTS UNDER

EITHER THE COST OR EQUITY METHOD AND INCLUDE THEM IN OTHER

LONG-TERM ASSETS. OUR NON-MARKETABLE AND OTHER EQUITY

INVESTMENTS INCLUDE.



EQUITY METHOD INVESTMENTS

WHEN WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO

EXERCISE SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE, BUT NOT CONTROL, OVER THE

OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY

IMPAIRMENT

ALL OF OUR AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE INVESTMENTS AND NON-MARKETABLE AND

OTHER EQUITY INVESTMENTS ARE SUBJECT TO A PERIODIC IMPAIRMENT

REVIEW. INVESTMENTS ARE CONSIDERED TO BE IMPAIRED WHEN A DECLINE

IN FAIR VALUE IS JUDGED TO BE OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY, FOR THE

FOLLOWING INVESTMENTS.



MARKETABLE EQUITY SECURITIES

WHEN THE RESULTING FAIR

VALUE IS SIGNIFICANTLY BELOW COST BASIS

AND/OR

THE

SIGNIFICANT DECLINE HAS LASTED FOR AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF TIME.

THE EVALUATION THAT WE USE TO DETERMINE WHETHER A MARKETABLE

EQUITY SECURITY IS IMPAIRED IS BASED ON THE SPECIFIC FACTS AND

CIRCUMSTANCES PRESENT AT THE TIME OF ASSESSMENT, WHICH INCLUDE

THE CONSIDERATION OF GENERAL MARKET CONDITIONS, THE DURATION AND

EXTENT TO WHICH THE FAIR VALUE IS BELOW COST, AND OUR INTENT AND

ABILITY TO HOLD THE INVESTMENT FOR A SUFFICIENT PERIOD OF TIME

TO ALLOW FOR RECOVERY IN VALUE. WE ALSO CONSIDER SPECIFIC

ADVERSE CONDITIONS RELATED TO THE FINANCIAL HEALTH OF AND

BUSINESS OUTLOOK FOR THE INVESTEE, INCLUDING INDUSTRY AND SECTOR

PERFORMANCE, CHANGES IN TECHNOLOGY, OPERATIONAL AND FINANCING

CASH FLOW FACTORS, AND CHANGES IN THE INVESTEES CREDIT

RATING.



NON-MARKETABLE EQUITY INVESTMENTS

WHEN EVENTS OR

CIRCUMSTANCES ARE IDENTIFIED THAT WOULD SIGNIFICANTLY HARM THE

FAIR VALUE OF THE INVESTMENT. THE INDICATORS THAT WE USE TO

IDENTIFY THOSE EVENTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES INCLUDE.



THE INVESTEES REVENUE AND EARNING TRENDS RELATIVE TO

PREDEFINED MILESTONES AND OVERALL BUSINESS PROSPECTS;



THE TECHNOLOGICAL FEASIBILITY OF THE INVESTEES PRODUCTS

AND TECHNOLOGIES;



THE GENERAL MARKET CONDITIONS IN THE INVESTEES INDUSTRY OR

GEOGRAPHIC AREA, INCLUDING REGULATORY OR ECONOMIC CHANGES;



FACTORS RELATED TO THE INVESTEES ABILITY TO REMAIN IN

BUSINESS, SUCH AS THE INVESTEES LIQUIDITY, DEBT RATIOS,

AND THE RATE AT WHICH THE INVESTEE IS USING ITS CASH; AND



THE INVESTEES RECEIPT OF ADDITIONAL FUNDING AT A LOWER

VALUATION. IF AN INVESTEE OBTAINS ADDITIONAL FUNDING AT A

VALUATION LOWER THAN OUR CARRYING AMOUNT OR A NEW ROUND OF

EQUITY FUNDING IS REQUIRED FOR THE INVESTEE TO REMAIN IN

BUSINESS, AND THE NEW ROUND OF EQUITY DOES NOT APPEAR IMMINENT,

IT IS PRESUMED THAT THE INVESTMENT IS OTHER THAN TEMPORARILY

IMPAIRED, UNLESS SPECIFIC FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE

OTHERWISE.



MARKETABLE DEBT INSTRUMENTS

WHEN THE FAIR VALUE IS

SIGNIFICANTLY BELOW AMORTIZED COST

AND/OR

THE

SIGNIFICANT DECLINE HAS LASTED FOR AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF TIME

AND WE DO NOT HAVE THE INTENT AND ABILITY TO HOLD THE INVESTMENT

FOR A SUFFICIENT PERIOD OF TIME TO ALLOW FOR RECOVERY. THE

EVALUATION THAT WE USE TO DETERMINE WHETHER A MARKETABLE DEBT

INSTRUMENT IS IMPAIRED IS BASED ON THE SPECIFIC FACTS AND

CIRCUMSTANCES PRESENT AT THE TIME OF ASSESSMENT, WHICH INCLUDE

THE CONSIDERATION OF THE FINANCIAL CONDITION AND NEAR-TERM

PROSPECTS OF THE ISSUER, AND THE DURATION AND EXTENT TO WHICH

THE FAIR VALUE IS BELOW COST.

INVESTMENTS THAT WE IDENTIFY AS HAVING AN INDICATOR OF

IMPAIRMENT ARE SUBJECT TO FURTHER ANALYSIS TO DETERMINE IF THE

INVESTMENT IS OTHER THAN TEMPORARILY IMPAIRED, IN WHICH CASE WE

WRITE DOWN THE INVESTMENT TO ITS ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE. FOR

NON-MARKETABLE EQUITY INVESTMENTS THAT WE DO NOT CONSIDER VIABLE

FROM A FINANCIAL OR TECHNOLOGICAL POINT OF VIEW, WE WRITE THE

ENTIRE INVESTMENT DOWN, SINCE WE CONSIDER THE ESTIMATED FAIR

VALUE TO BE NOMINAL. WE RECORD IMPAIRMENT CHARGES IN GAINS

(LOSSES) ON EQUITY INVESTMENTS, NET FOR MARKETABLE AND

NON-MARKETABLE EQUITY INVESTMENTS OR IN INTEREST AND OTHER, NET

FOR DEBT INSTRUMENT INVESTMENTS.

FAIR

VALUES OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

THE CARRYING VALUE OF CASH EQUIVALENTS APPROXIMATES FAIR VALUE

DUE TO THE SHORT PERIOD OF TIME TO MATURITY. FAIR VALUES OF

SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS, TRADING ASSETS, LONG-TERM INVESTMENTS,

MARKETABLE EQUITY INVESTMENTS, CERTAIN NON-MARKETABLE

INVESTMENTS, SHORT-TERM DEBT, LONG-TERM DEBT, SWAPS, CURRENCY

FORWARD CONTRACTS, CURRENCY OPTIONS, EQUITY OPTIONS, AND

WARRANTS ARE BASED ON QUOTED MARKET PRICES OR PRICING MODELS

USING CURRENT MARKET DATA WHEN AVAILABLE. DEBT INSTRUMENTS ARE

GENERALLY VALUED USING A QUOTED MARKET PRICE OF IDENTICAL OR

SIMILAR INSTRUMENTS OR DISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS IN A YIELD-CURVE

MODEL BASED ON LIBOR. EQUITY OPTIONS AND WARRANTS ARE PRICED

USING OPTION PRICING MODELS. OUR FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS ARE

RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE, EXCEPT FOR COST BASIS LOAN PARTICIPATION

NOTES AND DEBT. ESTIMATED FAIR VALUES ARE MANAGEMENTS

ESTIMATES; HOWEVER, WHEN THERE IS NO READILY AVAILABLE MARKET

DATA, THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUES MAY NOT NECESSARILY REPRESENT

THE AMOUNTS THAT COULD BE REALIZED IN A CURRENT TRANSACTION, AND

THE FAIR VALUES COULD CHANGE SIGNIFICANTLY. FOR A LISTING OF

FAIR VALUES AND CARRYING VALUES OF OUR TRADING ASSETS AND

AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE INVESTMENTS FOR 2007 AND 2006, SEE

NOTE 7: INVESTMENTS.

FOR OUR MARKETABLE EQUITY METHOD INVESTMENT, THE FAIR VALUE

EXCEEDED THE AGGREGATE CARRYING VALUE BY $14 MILLION AS OF

DECEMBER 29, 2007. WE DID NOT HAVE ANY MARKETABLE EQUITY

METHOD INVESTMENTS IN 2006. FOR NON-MARKETABLE EQUITY

INVESTMENTS, THE FAIR VALUE EXCEEDED THE CARRYING VALUE BY

APPROXIMATELY $600 MILLION AS OF DECEMBER 29, 2007. WE

BELIEVE THAT THE FAIR VALUE OF NON-MARKETABLE EQUITY INVESTMENTS

APPROXIMATED THE CARRYING VALUE AT DECEMBER 30, 2006. FOR

OUR COST BASIS LOAN PARTICIPATION NOTES, THE FAIR VALUE EXCEEDED

THE CARRYING VALUE BY APPROXIMATELY $50 MILLION AS OF

DECEMBER 29, 2007 (APPROXIMATELY $55 MILLION AS OF

DECEMBER 30, 2006). THESE FAIR VALUE ESTIMATES TAKE INTO

ACCOUNT THE MOVEMENTS OF THE EQUITY AND VENTURE CAPITAL MARKETS

AS WELL AS CHANGES IN THE INTEREST RATE ENVIRONMENT, AND OTHER

ECONOMIC VARIABLES.

DERIVATIVE

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

OUR PRIMARY OBJECTIVE FOR HOLDING DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL

INSTRUMENTS IS TO MANAGE CURRENCY, INTEREST RATE, AND CERTAIN

EQUITY MARKET RISKS. OUR DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS ARE

RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE AND ARE INCLUDED IN OTHER CURRENT ASSETS,

OTHER LONG-TERM ASSETS, OTHER ACCRUED LIABILITIES, OR OTHER

LONG-TERM LIABILITIES. DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS RECORDED AS ASSETS

TOTALED $118 MILLION AT DECEMBER 29, 2007

($117 MILLION AT DECEMBER 30, 2006). DERIVATIVE

INSTRUMENTS RECORDED AS LIABILITIES TOTALED $130 MILLION AT

DECEMBER 29, 2007 ($62 MILLION AT DECEMBER 30,

2006).

OUR ACCOUNTING POLICIES FOR DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS ARE

BASED ON WHETHER THEY MEET THE CRITERIA FOR DESIGNATION AS CASH

FLOW OR FAIR VALUE HEDGES. A DESIGNATED HEDGE OF THE EXPOSURE TO

VARIABILITY IN THE FUTURE CASH FLOWS OF AN ASSET OR A LIABILITY,

OR OF A FORECASTED TRANSACTION, IS REFERRED TO AS A CASH FLOW

HEDGE. A DESIGNATED HEDGE OF THE EXPOSURE TO CHANGES IN FAIR

VALUE OF AN ASSET OR A LIABILITY, OR OF AN UNRECOGNIZED FIRM

COMMITMENT, IS REFERRED TO AS A FAIR VALUE HEDGE. THE CRITERIA

FOR DESIGNATING A DERIVATIVE AS A HEDGE INCLUDE THE ASSESSMENT

OF THE INSTRUMENTS EFFECTIVENESS IN RISK REDUCTION,

MATCHING OF THE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENT TO ITS UNDERLYING

TRANSACTION, AND THE PROBABILITY THAT THE UNDERLYING TRANSACTION

WILL OCCUR. WE RECOGNIZE GAINS AND LOSSES FROM CHANGES IN FAIR

VALUES OF DERIVATIVES THAT ARE NOT DESIGNATED AS HEDGES FOR

ACCOUNTING PURPOSES WITHIN THE SAME INCOME STATEMENT LINE ITEM

AS THE UNDERLYING ITEM, AND THESE GAINS AND LOSSES GENERALLY

OFFSET CHANGES IN FAIR VALUES OF RELATED ASSETS OR LIABILITIES.

DERIVATIVES THAT WE DESIGNATE AS HEDGES ARE CLASSIFIED IN THE

CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS IN THE SAME SECTION AS THE

UNDERLYING ITEM, PRIMARILY WITHIN CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING

ACTIVITIES. DERIVATIVES NOT DESIGNATED AS HEDGES ARE CLASSIFIED

IN CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES.

AS PART OF OUR STRATEGIC INVESTMENT PROGRAM, WE ALSO ACQUIRE

EQUITY DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS, SUCH AS WARRANTS AND EQUITY

CONVERSION RIGHTS ASSOCIATED WITH DEBT INSTRUMENTS, WHICH ARE

NOT DESIGNATED AS HEDGING INSTRUMENTS. WE RECOGNIZE THE GAINS OR

LOSSES FROM CHANGES IN FAIR VALUES OF THESE EQUITY DERIVATIVE

INSTRUMENTS IN GAINS (LOSSES) ON EQUITY INVESTMENTS, NET.

THROUGH THE USE OF DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, WE MANAGE

THE FOLLOWING RISKS.

CURRENCY

RISK

WE TRANSACT BUSINESS IN VARIOUS CURRENCIES OTHER THAN THE

U.S. DOLLAR AND HAVE ESTABLISHED BALANCE SHEET AND

FORECASTED TRANSACTION RISK MANAGEMENT PROGRAMS TO PROTECT

AGAINST FLUCTUATIONS IN FAIR VALUE AND THE VOLATILITY OF FUTURE

CASH FLOWS CAUSED BY CHANGES IN EXCHANGE RATES. THE FORECASTED

TRANSACTION RISK MANAGEMENT PROGRAM INCLUDES ANTICIPATED

TRANSACTIONS SUCH AS OPERATING EXPENDITURES AND CAPITAL

PURCHASES. THESE PROGRAMS REDUCE, BUT DO NOT ALWAYS ENTIRELY

ELIMINATE, THE IMPACT OF CURRENCY EXCHANGE MOVEMENTS.

MEASUREMENT

OF EFFECTIVENESS



EFFECTIVENESS FOR FORWARDS

IS GENERALLY MEASURED BY

COMPARING THE CUMULATIVE CHANGE IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE HEDGE

CONTRACT WITH THE CUMULATIVE CHANGE IN THE PRESENT VALUE OF THE

FORECASTED CASH FLOWS OF THE HEDGED ITEM. FOR CURRENCY FORWARD

CONTRACTS USED IN CASH FLOW HEDGING STRATEGIES RELATED TO

CAPITAL PURCHASES, FORWARD POINTS ARE EXCLUDED, AND

EFFECTIVENESS IS MEASURED USING SPOT RATES TO VALUE BOTH THE

HEDGE CONTRACT AND THE HEDGED ITEM. FOR CURRENCY FORWARD

CONTRACTS USED IN CASH FLOW HEDGING STRATEGIES RELATED TO

OPERATING EXPENDITURES, FORWARD POINTS ARE INCLUDED AND

EFFECTIVENESS IS MEASURED USING FORWARD RATES TO VALUE BOTH THE

HEDGE CONTRACT AND THE HEDGED ITEM.



EFFECTIVENESS FOR CURRENCY OPTIONS AND EQUITY OPTIONS WITH

HEDGE ACCOUNTING DESIGNATION

IS GENERALLY MEASURED BY

COMPARING THE CUMULATIVE CHANGE IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE HEDGE

CONTRACT WITH THE CUMULATIVE CHANGE IN THE FAIR VALUE OF AN

OPTION INSTRUMENT REPRESENTING THE HEDGED RISKS IN THE HEDGED

ITEM FOR CASH FLOW HEDGES. FOR FAIR VALUE HEDGES, TIME VALUE IS

EXCLUDED AND EFFECTIVENESS IS MEASURED BASED ON SPOT RATES TO

VALUE BOTH THE HEDGE CONTRACT AND THE HEDGED ITEM.



EFFECTIVENESS FOR INTEREST RATE SWAPS

IS GENERALLY

MEASURED BY COMPARING THE CHANGE IN FAIR VALUE OF THE HEDGED

ITEM WITH THE CHANGE IN FAIR VALUE OF THE INTEREST RATE SWAP.

IF A CASH FLOW HEDGE WERE DISCONTINUED BECAUSE IT WAS NO LONGER

PROBABLE THAT THE ORIGINAL HEDGED TRANSACTION WOULD OCCUR AS

ANTICIPATED, THE UNREALIZED GAIN OR LOSS ON THE RELATED

DERIVATIVE WOULD BE RECLASSIFIED INTO EARNINGS. SUBSEQUENT GAINS

OR LOSSES ON THE RELATED DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENT WOULD BE

RECOGNIZED IN INCOME IN EACH PERIOD UNTIL THE INSTRUMENT

MATURES, IS TERMINATED, IS RE-DESIGNATED AS A QUALIFIED HEDGE,

OR IS SOLD. ANY INEFFECTIVE PORTION OF BOTH CASH FLOW AND FAIR

VALUE HEDGES, AS WELL AS AMOUNTS EXCLUDED FROM THE ASSESSMENT OF

EFFECTIVENESS, ARE RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS IN INTEREST AND OTHER,

NET.

SECURITIES

LENDING

WE MAY ENTER INTO SECURITIES LENDING AGREEMENTS WITH FINANCIAL

INSTITUTIONS, GENERALLY TO FACILITATE HEDGING AND CERTAIN

INVESTMENT TRANSACTIONS. SELECTED SECURITIES MAY BE LOANED,

SECURED BY COLLATERAL IN THE FORM OF CASH OR SECURITIES. THE

LOANED SECURITIES CONTINUE TO BE CARRIED AS INVESTMENT ASSETS ON

OUR CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS. CASH COLLATERAL IS RECORDED AS

AN ASSET WITH A CORRESPONDING LIABILITY. FOR LENDING AGREEMENTS

COLLATERALIZED BY SECURITIES, WE DO NOT RECORD THE COLLATERAL AS

AN ASSET OR A LIABILITY, UNLESS THE COLLATERAL IS REPLEDGED.

INVENTORIES

WE COMPUTE INVENTORY COST ON A CURRENTLY ADJUSTED STANDARD BASIS

(WHICH APPROXIMATES ACTUAL COST ON AN AVERAGE OR

FIRST-IN,

FIRST-OUT BASIS). THE VALUATION OF INVENTORY REQUIRES US TO

ESTIMATE OBSOLETE OR EXCESS INVENTORY AS WELL AS INVENTORY THAT

IS NOT OF SALEABLE QUALITY. THE DETERMINATION OF OBSOLETE OR

EXCESS INVENTORY REQUIRES US TO ESTIMATE THE FUTURE DEMAND FOR

OUR PRODUCTS. INVENTORY IN EXCESS OF SALEABLE AMOUNTS IS NOT

VALUED, AND THE REMAINING INVENTORY IS VALUED AT THE LOWER OF

COST OR MARKET. INVENTORIES AT FISCAL YEAR-ENDS WERE AS FOLLOWS.

REGULARLY PERFORMED IF FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THAT THE

CARRYING AMOUNT OF ASSETS MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE OR THAT THE

USEFUL LIFE IS SHORTER THAN WE HAD ORIGINALLY ESTIMATED. WE

ASSESS THE RECOVERABILITY OF OUR ASSETS HELD FOR USE BY

COMPARING THE PROJECTED UNDISCOUNTED NET CASH FLOWS ASSOCIATED

WITH THE RELATED ASSET OR GROUP OF ASSETS OVER THEIR REMAINING

ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES AGAINST THEIR RESPECTIVE CARRYING

AMOUNTS. IMPAIRMENT, IF ANY, IS BASED ON THE EXCESS OF THE

CARRYING AMOUNT OVER THE FAIR VALUE OF THOSE ASSETS. IF WE

ORIGINALLY ESTIMATED, WE DEPRECIATE THE NET BOOK VALUE OF THE

ASSETS OVER THE NEWLY DETERMINED REMAINING USEFUL LIVES. SEE

NOTE 16: RESTRUCTURING AND ASSET IMPAIRMENT

CHARGES FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION OF RESTRUCTURING-RELATED

ASSET IMPAIRMENT CHARGES THAT WE RECORDED DURING 2007 AND 2006.

STANDARDS (SFAS) NO. 144, ACCOUNTING FOR IMPAIRMENT

OR DISPOSAL OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS. WE RECLASSIFY HELD FOR

SALE ASSETS TO OTHER CURRENT ASSETS AND CEASE RECORDING

DEPRECIATION.

WE CAPITALIZE INTEREST ON BORROWINGS RELATED TO ELIGIBLE CAPITAL

EXPENDITURES. WE ADD CAPITALIZED INTEREST TO THE COST OF

QUALIFIED ASSETS AND AMORTIZE IT OVER THE ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES

OF THE ASSETS. CAPITAL-RELATED GOVERNMENT GRANTS EARNED ARE

RECORDED AS A REDUCTION TO PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT.

GOODWILL

WE RECORD GOODWILL WHEN THE PURCHASE PRICE OF AN ACQUISITION

EXCEEDS THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF THE NET IDENTIFIED TANGIBLE

AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS ACQUIRED. WE PERFORM AN ANNUAL IMPAIRMENT

REVIEW FOR EACH REPORTING UNIT USING A FAIR VALUE APPROACH.

REPORTING UNITS MAY BE OPERATING SEGMENTS AS A WHOLE OR AN

OPERATION ONE LEVEL BELOW AN OPERATING SEGMENT, REFERRED TO AS A

COMPONENT. IN DETERMINING THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE REPORTING

UNIT, WE HAVE TO MAKE AN ALLOCATION OF OUR MANUFACTURING AND

ASSEMBLY AND TEST ASSETS BECAUSE OF THE INTERCHANGEABLE NATURE

OF OUR MANUFACTURING AND ASSEMBLY AND TEST CAPACITY. WE BASE

THIS ALLOCATION ON EACH REPORTING UNITS RELATIVE

PERCENTAGE UTILIZATION OF THE MANUFACTURING AND ASSEMBLY AND

TEST ASSETS. IN THE EVENT THAT AN INDIVIDUAL BUSINESS WITHIN A

REPORTING UNIT IS DIVESTED, WE ALLOCATE GOODWILL TO THAT

BUSINESS BASED ON ITS FAIR VALUE RELATIVE TO ITS REPORTING UNIT.

FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION OF GOODWILL, SEE NOTE 15.

PRODUCT

WARRANTY

WE GENERALLY SELL PRODUCTS WITH A LIMITED WARRANTY ON PRODUCT

QUALITY AND A LIMITED INDEMNIFICATION FOR CUSTOMERS AGAINST

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY INFRINGEMENT CLAIMS RELATED TO OUR

PRODUCTS. WE ACCRUE FOR KNOWN WARRANTY AND INDEMNIFICATION

ISSUES IF A LOSS IS PROBABLE AND CAN BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED,

AND ACCRUE FOR ESTIMATED INCURRED BUT UNIDENTIFIED ISSUES BASED

ON HISTORICAL ACTIVITY. THE ACCRUAL AND THE RELATED EXPENSE FOR

KNOWN ISSUES WERE NOT SIGNIFICANT DURING THE PERIODS PRESENTED.

DUE TO PRODUCT TESTING AND THE SHORT TIME TYPICALLY BETWEEN

PRODUCT SHIPMENT AND THE DETECTION AND CORRECTION OF PRODUCT

REVENUE

RECOGNITION

WE RECOGNIZE NET REVENUE WHEN THE EARNINGS PROCESS IS COMPLETE,

AND PROBABLE COLLECTIBILITY. WE RECORD PRICING ALLOWANCES,

INCLUDING DISCOUNTS BASED ON CONTRACTUAL ARRANGEMENTS WITH

CUSTOMERS, WHEN REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED AS A REDUCTION TO BOTH

ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND NET REVENUE. BECAUSE OF FREQUENT SALES

PRICE REDUCTIONS AND RAPID TECHNOLOGY OBSOLESCENCE IN THE

INDUSTRY, WE DEFER SALES MADE TO DISTRIBUTORS UNDER AGREEMENTS

ALLOWING PRICE PROTECTION

RIGHT

OF RETURN UNTIL THE DISTRIBUTORS SELL THE MERCHANDISE. WE

INCLUDE SHIPPING CHARGES BILLED TO CUSTOMERS IN NET REVENUE, AND

INCLUDE THE RELATED SHIPPING COSTS IN COST OF SALES.

ADVERTISING

COOPERATIVE ADVERTISING PROGRAMS REIMBURSE CUSTOMERS FOR

MARKETING ACTIVITIES FOR CERTAIN OF OUR PRODUCTS, SUBJECT TO

DEFINED CRITERIA. WE ACCRUE COOPERATIVE ADVERTISING OBLIGATIONS

AND RECORD THE COSTS AT THE SAME TIME THE RELATED REVENUE IS

RECOGNIZED. WE RECORD COOPERATIVE ADVERTISING COSTS AS

MARKETING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES TO THE EXTENT

THAT AN ADVERTISING BENEFIT SEPARATE FROM THE REVENUE

TRANSACTION CAN BE IDENTIFIED AND THE FAIR VALUE OF THAT

ADVERTISING BENEFIT RECEIVED IS DETERMINABLE. WE RECORD ANY

EXCESS IN CASH PAID OVER THE FAIR VALUE OF THE ADVERTISING

BENEFIT RECEIVED AS A REDUCTION IN REVENUE. ADVERTISING COSTS

EMPLOYEE

EQUITY INCENTIVE PLANS

WE HAVE EMPLOYEE EQUITY INCENTIVE PLANS, WHICH ARE DESCRIBED

PLANS. EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2006, WE ADOPTED THE

PROVISIONS OF SFAS NO. 123 (REVISED 2004),

SHARE-BASED PAYMENT (SFAS NO. 123(R)).

SFAS NO. 123(R) REQUIRES EMPLOYEE EQUITY AWARDS TO BE

ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER THE FAIR VALUE METHOD. ACCORDINGLY, WE

MEASURE SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION AT THE GRANT DATE, BASED ON THE

FAIR VALUE OF THE AWARD. PRIOR TO JANUARY 1, 2006, WE

ACCOUNTED FOR AWARDS GRANTED UNDER OUR EQUITY INCENTIVE PLANS

USING THE INTRINSIC VALUE METHOD PRESCRIBED BY ACCOUNTING

PRINCIPLES BOARD (APB) OPINION NO. 25, ACCOUNTING FOR

STOCK ISSUED TO EMPLOYEES (APB NO. 25), AND RELATED

INTERPRETATIONS, AND PROVIDED THE REQUIRED PRO FORMA DISCLOSURES

PRESCRIBED BY SFAS NO. 123, ACCOUNTING FOR

STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION (SFAS NO. 123), AS

AMENDED. THE EXERCISE PRICE OF OPTIONS IS EQUAL TO THE VALUE OF

INTEL COMMON STOCK ON THE DATE OF GRANT. ADDITIONALLY, THE STOCK

PURCHASE PLAN WAS DEEMED NON-COMPENSATORY UNDER APB NO. 25.

ACCORDINGLY, PRIOR TO 2006 WE DID NOT RECOGNIZE ANY SHARE-BASED

COMPENSATION, OTHER THAN INSIGNIFICANT AMOUNTS OF

ACQUISITION-RELATED COMPENSATION, ON THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS (SFAS NO. 157).

SFAS NO. 157 DEFINES FAIR VALUE, ESTABLISHES A

FRAMEWORK FOR MEASURING FAIR VALUE, AND ENHANCES FAIR VALUE

MEASUREMENT DISCLOSURE. IN FEBRUARY 2008, THE FASB ISSUED FASB

STAFF POSITION (FSP) 157-1, APPLICATION OF FASB STATEMENT

NO. 157 TO FASB STATEMENT NO. 13 AND OTHER ACCOUNTING

PRONOUNCEMENTS THAT ADDRESS FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS FOR PURPOSES

OF LEASE CLASSIFICATION OR MEASUREMENT UNDER STATEMENT 13

(FSP 157-1) AND FSP

157-2,

EFFECTIVE DATE OF FASB STATEMENT NO. 157

(FSP 157-2).

FSP 157-1 AMENDS SFAS NO. 157 TO REMOVE CERTAIN LEASING

TRANSACTIONS FROM ITS SCOPE.

FSP 157-2

DELAYS THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF SFAS NO. 157 FOR ALL

NON-FINANCIAL ASSETS AND NON-FINANCIAL LIABILITIES, EXCEPT FOR

ITEMS THAT ARE RECOGNIZED OR DISCLOSED AT FAIR VALUE IN THE

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ON A RECURRING BASIS (AT LEAST ANNUALLY),

UNTIL THE BEGINNING OF THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2009. THE

MEASUREMENT AND DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS RELATED TO FINANCIAL

ASSETS AND FINANCIAL LIABILITIES ARE EFFECTIVE FOR US BEGINNING

IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2008. THE ADOPTION OF

SFAS NO. 157 FOR FINANCIAL ASSETS AND FINANCIAL

LIABILITIES WILL NOT HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON OUR

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. HOWEVER, THE RESULTING FAIR

VALUES CALCULATED UNDER SFAS NO. 157 AFTER ADOPTION

MAY BE DIFFERENT FROM THE FAIR VALUES THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN

CALCULATED UNDER PREVIOUS GUIDANCE. WE ARE CURRENTLY EVALUATING

THE IMPACT THAT SFAS NO. 157 WILL HAVE ON OUR

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS WHEN IT IS APPLIED TO

NON-FINANCIAL ASSETS AND NON-FINANCIAL LIABILITIES BEGINNING IN

THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2009.

IN FEBRUARY 2007, THE FASB ISSUED SFAS NO. 159,

THE FAIR VALUE OPTION FOR FINANCIAL ASSETS AND FINANCIAL

LIABILITIES (SFAS NO. 159).

SFAS NO. 159 PERMITS COMPANIES TO CHOOSE TO MEASURE

CERTAIN FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND OTHER ITEMS AT FAIR VALUE. THE

STANDARD REQUIRES THAT UNREALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES ARE REPORTED

IN EARNINGS FOR ITEMS MEASURED USING THE FAIR VALUE OPTION.

SFAS NO. 159 IS EFFECTIVE FOR US BEGINNING IN THE

FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL YEAR 2008. THE ADOPTION OF

SFAS NO. 159 IS NOT EXPECTED TO HAVE A SIGNIFICANT

IMPACT ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

IN JUNE 2007, THE FASB RATIFIED EITF ISSUE

NO. 07-3,

ACCOUNTING FOR NONREFUNDABLE ADVANCE PAYMENTS FOR GOODS OR

SERVICES TO BE USED IN FUTURE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

ACTIVITIES

(EITF 07-3).

EITF 07-3

REQUIRES NON-REFUNDABLE ADVANCE PAYMENTS FOR GOODS AND SERVICES

TO BE USED IN FUTURE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT (R&D)

ACTIVITIES TO BE RECORDED AS ASSETS AND THE PAYMENTS TO BE

EXPENSED WHEN THE R&D ACTIVITIES ARE PERFORMED.

EITF 07-3

APPLIES PROSPECTIVELY FOR NEW CONTRACTUAL ARRANGEMENTS ENTERED

INTO BEGINNING IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL YEAR 2008. PRIOR

TO ADOPTION, WE RECOGNIZED THESE NON-REFUNDABLE ADVANCE PAYMENTS

AS AN EXPENSE UPON PAYMENT. THE ADOPTION OF

EITF 07-3

IS NOT EXPECTED TO HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON OUR CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

IN DECEMBER 2007, THE FASB ISSUED SFAS NO. 141

(REVISED 2007), BUSINESS COMBINATIONS

(SFAS NO. 141(R)). UNDER SFAS NO. 141(R), AN

ENTITY IS REQUIRED TO RECOGNIZE THE ASSETS ACQUIRED, LIABILITIES

ASSUMED, CONTRACTUAL CONTINGENCIES, AND CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION

AT THEIR FAIR VALUE ON THE ACQUISITION DATE. IT FURTHER REQUIRES

THAT ACQUISITION-RELATED COSTS BE RECOGNIZED SEPARATELY FROM THE

ACQUISITION AND EXPENSED AS INCURRED, RESTRUCTURING COSTS

GENERALLY BE EXPENSED IN PERIODS SUBSEQUENT TO THE ACQUISITION

DATE, AND CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING FOR DEFERRED TAX ASSET VALUATION

ALLOWANCES AND ACQUIRED INCOME TAX UNCERTAINTIES AFTER THE

MEASUREMENT PERIOD IMPACT INCOME TAX EXPENSE. IN ADDITION,

ACQUIRED IN-PROCESS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT (IPR&D) IS

CAPITALIZED AS AN INTANGIBLE ASSET AND AMORTIZED OVER ITS

ESTIMATED USEFUL LIFE. THE ADOPTION OF SFAS NO. 141(R)

WILL CHANGE OUR ACCOUNTING TREATMENT FOR BUSINESS COMBINATIONS

ON A PROSPECTIVE BASIS BEGINNING IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL

YEAR 2009.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

IN DECEMBER 2007, THE FASB ISSUED SFAS NO. 160,

NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS IN CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTSAN AMENDMENT OF ARB NO. 51

(SFAS NO. 160). SFAS NO. 160 CHANGES THE

ACCOUNTING AND REPORTING FOR MINORITY INTERESTS, WHICH WILL BE

RECHARACTERIZED AS NON-CONTROLLING INTERESTS AND CLASSIFIED AS A

COMPONENT OF EQUITY. SFAS NO. 160 IS EFFECTIVE FOR US

ON A PROSPECTIVE BASIS FOR BUSINESS COMBINATIONS WITH AN

ACQUISITION DATE BEGINNING IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL YEAR

2009. AS OF DECEMBER 29, 2007, WE DID NOT HAVE ANY MINORITY

INTERESTS. THE ADOPTION OF SFAS NO. 160 WILL NOT

IMPACT OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

IN DECEMBER 2007, THE U.S. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE

COMMISSION (SEC) ISSUED STAFF ACCOUNTING BULLETIN 110

(SAB 110) TO AMEND THE SECS VIEWS DISCUSSED IN

STAFF ACCOUNTING BULLETIN 107 (SAB 107) REGARDING

THE USE OF THE SIMPLIFIED METHOD IN DEVELOPING AN ESTIMATE OF

EXPECTED LIFE OF SHARE OPTIONS IN ACCORDANCE WITH

SFAS NO. 123(R). SAB 110 IS EFFECTIVE FOR US

BEGINNING IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL YEAR 2008. WE WILL

CONTINUE TO USE THE SIMPLIFIED METHOD UNTIL WE HAVE THE

HISTORICAL DATA NECESSARY TO PROVIDE A REASONABLE ESTIMATE OF

EXPECTED LIFE IN ACCORDANCE WITH SAB 107, AS AMENDED BY

SAB 110.

IN FISCAL YEAR 2007, WE ADOPTED EITF ISSUE

NO. 06-2,

ACCOUNTING FOR SABBATICAL LEAVE AND OTHER SIMILAR BENEFITS

PURSUANT TO FASB STATEMENT NO. 43

(EITF 06-2).

EITF 06-2

REQUIRES COMPANIES TO ACCRUE THE COST OF THESE COMPENSATED

ABSENCES OVER THE SERVICE PERIOD. WE ADOPTED

EITF 06-2

THROUGH A CUMULATIVE-EFFECT ADJUSTMENT, RESULTING IN AN

ADDITIONAL LIABILITY OF $280 MILLION, ADDITIONAL DEFERRED

TAX ASSETS OF $99 MILLION, AND A REDUCTION TO RETAINED

EARNINGS OF $181 MILLION AT THE BEGINNING OF 2007.

WE ALSO ADOPTED FASB INTERPRETATION NO. 48,

ACCOUNTING FOR UNCERTAINTY IN INCOME TAXESAN

INTERPRETATION OF FASB STATEMENT NO. 109

(FIN 48), AND RELATED GUIDANCE IN FISCAL YEAR 2007. SEE

NOTE 17: TAXES FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION.

NOTE 3.

EMPLOYEE EQUITY INCENTIVE PLANS

OUR EQUITY INCENTIVE PLANS ARE BROAD-BASED, LONG-TERM RETENTION

PROGRAMS INTENDED TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN TALENTED EMPLOYEES AND

ALIGN STOCKHOLDER AND EMPLOYEE INTERESTS.

IN MAY 2007, STOCKHOLDERS APPROVED AN EXTENSION OF THE 2006

EQUITY INCENTIVE PLAN (THE 2006 PLAN). STOCKHOLDERS APPROVED

119 MILLION ADDITIONAL SHARES FOR ISSUANCE, INCREASING THE

TOTAL SHARES OF COMMON STOCK AVAILABLE FOR ISSUANCE AS EQUITY

AWARDS TO EMPLOYEES AND

NON-EMPLOYEE

DIRECTORS TO 294 MILLION SHARES. OF THIS AMOUNT, WE

INCREASED THE MAXIMUM NUMBER OF SHARES TO BE AWARDED AS

NON-VESTED SHARES (RESTRICTED STOCK) OR NON-VESTED SHARE UNITS

(RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS) TO 168 MILLION SHARES. THE

APPROVAL ALSO EXTENDED THE EXPIRATION DATE OF THE 2006 PLAN TO

JUNE 2010. THE 2006 PLAN ALLOWS FOR TIME-BASED,

PERFORMANCE-BASED, AND MARKET-BASED VESTING FOR EQUITY INCENTIVE

AWARDS. AS OF DECEMBER 29, 2007, WE HAD NOT ISSUED ANY

PERFORMANCE-BASED OR MARKET-BASED EQUITY INCENTIVE AWARDS. AS OF

DECEMBER 29, 2007, 226 MILLION SHARES REMAINED

AVAILABLE FOR FUTURE GRANT UNDER THE 2006 PLAN. WE MAY ASSUME

THE EQUITY INCENTIVE PLANS AND THE OUTSTANDING EQUITY AWARDS OF

CERTAIN ACQUIRED COMPANIES. ONCE THEY ARE ASSUMED, WE DO NOT

GRANT ADDITIONAL SHARES UNDER THESE PLANS.

WE BEGAN ISSUING RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS IN 2006. WE ISSUE SHARES

ON THE DATE THAT THE RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS VEST. THE MAJORITY

OF SHARES ISSUED ARE NET OF THE STATUTORY WITHHOLDING

REQUIREMENTS THAT WE PAY ON BEHALF OF OUR EMPLOYEES. AS A

RESULT, THE ACTUAL NUMBER OF SHARES ISSUED WILL BE LESS THAN THE

NUMBER OF RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS GRANTED. PRIOR TO VESTING,

RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS DO NOT HAVE DIVIDEND EQUIVALENT RIGHTS,

DO NOT HAVE VOTING RIGHTS, AND THE SHARES UNDERLYING THE

RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS ARE NOT CONSIDERED ISSUED AND OUTSTANDING.

EQUITY AWARDS GRANTED TO EMPLOYEES IN 2007 UNDER OUR EQUITY

INCENTIVE PLANS GENERALLY VEST OVER 4 YEARS FROM THE DATE

OF GRANT, AND OPTIONS EXPIRE 7 YEARS FROM THE DATE OF

GRANT. EQUITY AWARDS GRANTED TO KEY OFFICERS, SENIOR-LEVEL

EMPLOYEES, AND KEY EMPLOYEES IN 2007 MAY HAVE DELAYED

VESTING BEGINNING 2 TO 5 YEARS FROM THE DATE OF GRANT, AND

OPTIONS EXPIRE 7 TO 10 YEARS FROM THE DATE OF GRANT.

THE 2006 STOCK PURCHASE PLAN ALLOWS ELIGIBLE EMPLOYEES TO

PURCHASE SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK AT 85% OF THE VALUE OF OUR

COMMON STOCK ON SPECIFIC DATES. UNDER THE 2006 STOCK PURCHASE

PLAN, WE MADE 240 MILLION SHARES OF COMMON STOCK AVAILABLE

FOR ISSUANCE THROUGH AUGUST 2011. AS OF DECEMBER 29, 2007,

214 MILLION SHARES WERE AVAILABLE FOR ISSUANCE UNDER THE

2006 STOCK PURCHASE PLAN.

SHARE-BASED

COMPENSATION

EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2006, WE ADOPTED THE PROVISIONS OF

SFAS NO. 123(R), AS DISCUSSED IN NOTE 2.

ACCOUNTING POLICIES. SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION RECOGNIZED

IN 2007 WAS $952 MILLION ($1,375 MILLION IN 2006 AND

ZERO IN 2005).

IN ACCORDANCE WITH SFAS NO. 123(R), WE ADJUST

SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION ON A QUARTERLY BASIS FOR CHANGES TO OUR

ESTIMATE OF EXPECTED EQUITY AWARD FORFEITURES BASED ON OUR

REVIEW OF RECENT FORFEITURE ACTIVITY AND EXPECTED FUTURE

EMPLOYEE TURNOVER. WE RECOGNIZE THE EFFECT OF ADJUSTING THE

FORFEITURE RATE FOR ALL EXPENSE AMORTIZATION AFTER

JANUARY 1, 2006 IN THE PERIOD THAT WE CHANGE THE FORFEITURE

ESTIMATE. THE EFFECT OF FORFEITURE ADJUSTMENTS IN 2007 AND 2006

WAS INSIGNIFICANT.

THE TOTAL SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION COST CAPITALIZED AS PART OF

INVENTORY AS OF DECEMBER 29, 2007 WAS $41 MILLION

($72 MILLION AS OF DECEMBER 30, 2006). THE AMOUNT THAT

WE WOULD HAVE CAPITALIZED TO INVENTORY AS OF DECEMBER 31,

2005, IF WE HAD APPLIED THE PROVISIONS OF

SFAS NO. 123(R) RETROSPECTIVELY, WAS $66 MILLION.

UNDER THE PROVISIONS OF SFAS NO. 123(R), WE RECORDED

$66 MILLION AS A CREDIT TO COMMON STOCK AND CAPITAL IN

EXCESS OF PAR VALUE. DURING 2007, THE TAX BENEFIT THAT WE

REALIZED FOR THE TAX DEDUCTION FROM OPTION EXERCISES AND OTHER

AWARDS TOTALED $265 MILLION ($139 MILLION IN 2006).

WE BASE THE EXPECTED VOLATILITY ON IMPLIED VOLATILITY, BECAUSE

WE HAVE DETERMINED THAT IMPLIED VOLATILITY IS MORE REFLECTIVE OF

MARKET CONDITIONS AND A BETTER INDICATOR OF EXPECTED VOLATILITY

THAN HISTORICAL VOLATILITY. WE USE THE SIMPLIFIED METHOD OF

CALCULATING EXPECTED LIFE DESCRIBED IN SAB 107, DUE TO

SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES IN THE VESTING TERMS AND CONTRACTUAL

LIFE OF CURRENT OPTION GRANTS COMPARED TO OUR HISTORICAL GRANTS.

WE ESTIMATE THE FAIR VALUE OF RESTRICTED STOCK UNIT AWARDS USING

AVERAGE STOCK OPTIONS (693 MILLION IN 2006 AND

372 MILLION IN 2005) FROM THE CALCULATION OF DILUTED

EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE BECAUSE THE EXERCISE PRICES OF THESE

STOCK OPTIONS WERE GREATER THAN OR EQUAL TO THE AVERAGE MARKET

STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM

WE HAVE AN ONGOING AUTHORIZATION, AMENDED IN NOVEMBER 2005, FROM

OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS TO REPURCHASE UP TO $25 BILLION IN

SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK IN OPEN MARKET OR NEGOTIATED

SHARES AT A COST OF APPROXIMATELY $60 BILLION SINCE THE

PROGRAM BEGAN IN 1990. AS OF DECEMBER 29, 2007,

$14.5 BILLION REMAINED AVAILABLE FOR REPURCHASE UNDER THE

EXISTING REPURCHASE AUTHORIZATION.

RESTRICTED STOCK UNIT WITHHOLDINGS

WE ISSUE RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS AS PART OF OUR EQUITY INCENTIVE

PLANS, WHICH ARE DESCRIBED MORE FULLY IN NOTE 3.

EMPLOYEE EQUITY INCENTIVE PLANS. FOR THE MAJORITY OF

RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS GRANTED, THE NUMBER OF SHARES ISSUED ON

THE DATE THE RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS VEST IS NET OF THE STATUTORY

WITHHOLDING REQUIREMENTS THAT WE PAY ON BEHALF OF OUR EMPLOYEES.

DURING 2007, WE WITHHELD 1.7 MILLION SHARES TO SATISFY

$38 MILLION OF EMPLOYEES TAX OBLIGATIONS. WE PAID

THIS AMOUNT IN CASH TO THE APPROPRIATE TAXING AUTHORITIES.

ALTHOUGH SHARES WITHHELD ARE NOT ISSUED, THEY ARE TREATED AS

COMMON STOCK REPURCHASES FOR ACCOUNTING AND DISCLOSURE PURPOSES,

AS THEY REDUCE THE NUMBER OF SHARES THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN ISSUED

IN 2005, WE ISSUED $1.6 BILLION OF 2.95% JUNIOR

SUBORDINATED CONVERTIBLE DEBENTURES (THE DEBENTURES) DUE 2035.

THE DEBENTURES ARE CONVERTIBLE, SUBJECT TO CERTAIN CONDITIONS,

INTO SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK AT AN INITIAL CONVERSION RATE OF

31.7162 SHARES OF COMMON STOCK PER $1,000 PRINCIPAL AMOUNT

OF DEBENTURES, REPRESENTING AN INITIAL EFFECTIVE CONVERSION

PRICE OF APPROXIMATELY $31.53 PER SHARE OF COMMON STOCK. HOLDERS

CAN SURRENDER THE DEBENTURES FOR CONVERSION AT ANY TIME. THE

CONVERSION RATE WILL BE SUBJECT TO ADJUSTMENT FOR CERTAIN EVENTS

OUTLINED IN THE INDENTURE GOVERNING THE DEBENTURES, BUT WILL NOT

BE ADJUSTED FOR ACCRUED INTEREST. IN ADDITION, THE CONVERSION

RATE WILL INCREASE FOR A HOLDER WHO ELECTS TO CONVERT THE

DEBENTURES IN CONNECTION WITH CERTAIN SHARE EXCHANGES, MERGERS,

OR CONSOLIDATIONS INVOLVING INTEL, AS DESCRIBED IN THE INDENTURE

GOVERNING THE DEBENTURES. THE DEBENTURES, WHICH PAY A FIXED RATE

OF INTEREST SEMIANNUALLY, HAVE A CONTINGENT INTEREST COMPONENT

THAT WILL REQUIRE US TO PAY INTEREST BASED ON CERTAIN THRESHOLDS

AND FOR CERTAIN EVENTS COMMENCING ON DECEMBER 15, 2010, AS

OUTLINED IN THE INDENTURE. THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT OF CONTINGENT

INTEREST THAT WILL ACCRUE IS 0.40% PER YEAR. THE FAIR VALUE OF

THE RELATED EMBEDDED DERIVATIVE WAS NOT SIGNIFICANT AS OF

DECEMBER 29, 2007 OR DECEMBER 30, 2006.

WE CAN SETTLE ANY CONVERSION OR REPURCHASE OF THE DEBENTURES IN

CASH OR STOCK AT OUR OPTION. ON OR AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2012,

WE CAN REDEEM, FOR CASH, ALL OR PART OF THE DEBENTURES FOR THE

PRINCIPAL AMOUNT, PLUS ANY ACCRUED AND UNPAID INTEREST, IF THE

CLOSING PRICE OF INTEL COMMON STOCK HAS BEEN AT LEAST 130% OF

THE CONVERSION PRICE THEN IN EFFECT FOR AT LEAST 20 TRADING DAYS

DURING ANY 30 CONSECUTIVE

TRADING-DAY

PERIOD PRIOR TO THE DATE ON WHICH WE PROVIDE NOTICE OF

REDEMPTION. IF CERTAIN EVENTS OCCUR IN THE FUTURE, THE INDENTURE

PROVIDES THAT EACH HOLDER OF THE DEBENTURES CAN, FOR A

PRE-DEFINED PERIOD OF TIME, REQUIRE US TO REPURCHASE THE

HOLDERS DEBENTURES FOR THE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT PLUS ANY

ACCRUED AND UNPAID INTEREST. THE DEBENTURES ARE SUBORDINATED IN

RIGHT OF PAYMENT TO OUR EXISTING AND FUTURE SENIOR DEBT AND TO

THE OTHER LIABILITIES OF OUR SUBSIDIARIES. WE CONCLUDED THAT THE

DEBENTURES ARE NOT CONVENTIONAL CONVERTIBLE DEBT INSTRUMENTS AND

THAT THE EMBEDDED STOCK CONVERSION OPTION QUALIFIES AS A

DERIVATIVE UNDER SFAS NO. 133, ACCOUNTING FOR

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES

(SFAS NO. 133). IN ADDITION, IN ACCORDANCE WITH

EITF 00-19,

ACCOUNTING FOR DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS INDEXED

TO, AND POTENTIALLY SETTLED IN, A COMPANYS OWN

STOCK, WE HAVE CONCLUDED THAT THE EMBEDDED CONVERSION

OPTION WOULD BE CLASSIFIED IN STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY IF IT

WERE A FREESTANDING INSTRUMENT. AS SUCH, THE EMBEDDED CONVERSION

OPTION IS NOT ACCOUNTED FOR SEPARATELY AS A DERIVATIVE.

IN 2005, WE GUARANTEED REPAYMENT OF PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST ON

BONDS ISSUED BY THE INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY OF THE CITY

OF CHANDLER, ARIZONA, WHICH CONSTITUTES AN UNSECURED GENERAL

OBLIGATION FOR INTEL. THE AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT, INCLUDING

THE PREMIUM, OF THE BONDS ISSUED IN 2005 (2005 ARIZONA BONDS)

WAS $160 MILLION. THE BONDS ARE DUE IN 2035 AND BEAR

INTEREST AT A FIXED RATE OF 4.375% UNTIL 2010. THE 2005 ARIZONA

BONDS ARE SUBJECT TO MANDATORY TENDER ON NOVEMBER 30, 2010,

AT WHICH TIME WE CAN

RE-MARKET

THE BONDS AS EITHER FIXED-RATE BONDS FOR A SPECIFIED PERIOD OR

AS VARIABLE-RATE BONDS UNTIL THEIR FINAL MATURITY ON

DECEMBER 1, 2035.

IN 2007, WE GUARANTEED REPAYMENT OF PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST ON

BONDS ISSUED BY THE INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY OF THE CITY

OF CHANDLER, ARIZONA, WHICH CONSTITUTE AN UNSECURED GENERAL

OBLIGATION FOR INTEL. THE AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF THE

BONDS ISSUED IN DECEMBER 2007 (2007 ARIZONA BONDS) IS

$125 MILLION DUE IN 2037, AND THE BONDS BEAR INTEREST AT A

FIXED RATE OF 5.3%. THE 2007 ARIZONA BONDS ARE SUBJECT TO

MANDATORY TENDER, AT OUR OPTION, ON ANY INTEREST PAYMENT DATE

BEGINNING ON OR AFTER DECEMBER 1, 2012 UNTIL THEIR FINAL

MATURITY ON DECEMBER 1, 2037. UPON SUCH TENDER, WE CAN

RE-MARKET THE BONDS AS EITHER FIXED-RATE BONDS FOR A SPECIFIED

PERIOD OR AS VARIABLE-RATE BONDS UNTIL THEIR FINAL MATURITY. WE

ALSO ENTERED INTO AN INTEREST RATE SWAP AGREEMENT, FROM A FIXED

RATE TO A FLOATING

LIBOR-BASED

RETURN. AT THE BEGINNING OF THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2008, WE

ELECTED THE PROVISIONS OF SFAS NO. 159, AND WE WILL

RECORD THE 2007 ARIZONA BONDS AT FAIR VALUE AT EACH

REPORTING DATE. AS A RESULT, CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THIS

DEBT WILL BE PRIMARILY OFFSET BY CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF

THE INTEREST RATE SWAP, WITHOUT THE NEED TO APPLY THE HEDGE

ACCOUNTING PROVISIONS OF SFAS NO. 133.

WE HAVE EURO BORROWINGS, WHICH WE MADE IN CONNECTION WITH

FINANCING MANUFACTURING FACILITIES AND EQUIPMENT IN IRELAND. WE

HAVE INVESTED THE PROCEEDS IN EURO-DENOMINATED LOAN

PARTICIPATION NOTES OF SIMILAR MATURITY TO REDUCE CURRENCY AND

INTEREST RATE EXPOSURES. DURING 2006, WE RETIRED APPROXIMATELY

$300 MILLION IN EURO BORROWINGS PRIOR TO THEIR MATURITY

DATES THROUGH THE SIMULTANEOUS SETTLEMENT OF AN EQUIVALENT

AMOUNT OF INVESTMENTS IN LOAN PARTICIPATION NOTES.

RELATED TO THE EQUITY MARKET RISK OF CERTAIN DEFERRED

COMPENSATION ARRANGEMENTS. THESE DEFERRED COMPENSATION

LIABILITIES WERE $483 MILLION IN 2007 ($416 MILLION IN

INSIGNIFICANT AMOUNT IN RELATION TO OUR TOTAL AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE

PORTFOLIO. SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR UNREALIZED LOSSES CAN BE

ATTRIBUTED TO FAIR VALUE FLUCTUATIONS IN AN UNSTABLE CREDIT

ENVIRONMENT. AS OF DECEMBER 29, 2007, ALL OF OUR

INVESTMENTS IN ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES WERE RATED AAA/AAA, AND

THE SUBSTANTIAL MAJORITY OF THE INVESTMENTS IN FLOATING RATE

RATED AA/AA2 OR BETTER. OUR PORTFOLIO INCLUDES $1.8 BILLION

OF ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES COLLATERALIZED BY FIRST-LIEN

MORTGAGES, CREDIT CARD DEBT, STUDENT LOANS, AND AUTO LOANS. WE

HAVE THE INTENT AND ABILITY TO HOLD OUR DEBT INVESTMENTS FOR A

SUFFICIENT PERIOD OF TIME TO ALLOW FOR RECOVERY OF THE PRINCIPAL

AMOUNTS INVESTED.

THE $50 MILLION OF UNREALIZED LOSS FOR MARKETABLE EQUITY

SECURITIES WAS ATTRIBUTED TO THE FAIR VALUE DECLINE IN OUR

INVESTMENT IN MICRON. AS OF DECEMBER 29, 2007, MICRON HAD

BEEN TRADING AT LEVELS BELOW OUR COST BASIS FOR LESS THAN TWO

MONTHS, AS ITS STOCK PRICE HAS BEEN IMPACTED BY WEAKENED DRAM

AND NAND MARKET SEGMENTS. AN OVERSUPPLY WITHIN THE DRAM AND NAND

MARKET SEGMENTS CONTRIBUTED TO WEAKENING AVERAGE SELLING PRICES

WITHIN THESE HIGHLY COMPETITIVE MARKET SEGMENTS. WE BELIEVE THAT

THE MARKET SEGMENTS WILL RECOVER WITHIN A REASONABLE PERIOD

GIVEN PAST CYCLICAL PATTERNS, AND WE HAVE THE INTENT AND ABILITY

TO HOLD OUR INVESTMENT IN MICRON FOR A SUFFICIENT PERIOD OF TIME

TO ALLOW FOR RECOVERY.

WE BELIEVE THAT THE UNREALIZED LOSSES IN ALL OF THE ABOVE

INVESTMENTS ARE TEMPORARY AND THAT THESE LOSSES DO NOT REPRESENT

A NEED FOR AN

OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY

IMPAIRMENT, BASED ON OUR EVALUATION OF AVAILABLE EVIDENCE AS OF

DECEMBER 29, 2007.

THE INVESTMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN IN AN UNREALIZED LOSS POSITION

AS OF DECEMBER 29, 2007, OUR MARKETABLE EQUITY METHOD

INVESTMENT CONSISTED OF OUR INVESTMENT IN CLEARWIRE IN WHICH WE

HOLD AN OWNERSHIP INTEREST OF 22% (27% AS OF DECEMBER 30,

2006). IN MARCH 2007, CLEARWIRE COMPLETED AN INITIAL PUBLIC

OFFERING AND IS PUBLICLY TRADED ON THE NASDAQ GLOBAL SELECT

MARKET*. BASED ON THE QUOTED CLOSING STOCK PRICE AS OF

DECEMBER 28, 2007, THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR OWNERSHIP INTEREST

IN CLEARWIRE WAS $522 MILLION; HOWEVER, SINCE WE ACCOUNT

FOR OUR INVESTMENT UNDER THE EQUITY METHOD, WE DO NOT CARRY THE

INVESTMENT AT FAIR VALUE. WE RECORD OUR PROPORTIONATE SHARE OF

CLEARWIRES NET INCOME (LOSS) ON A ONE-QUARTER LAG.

AS OF DECEMBER 29, 2007, THE CARRYING VALUE OF OUR

INVESTMENT IN CLEARWIRE EXCEEDED OUR SHARE OF THE BOOK VALUE OF

CLEARWIRES ASSETS BY $213 MILLION. OF THIS AMOUNT,

$108 MILLION IS CONSIDERED EQUITY METHOD GOODWILL AND IS

NOT AMORTIZED IN ACCORDANCE WITH SFAS NO. 142,

GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS, AND APB

OPINION NO. 18, THE EQUITY METHOD OF ACCOUNTING FOR

INVESTMENTS IN COMMON STOCK. THE REMAINING

$105 MILLION REPRESENTS OUR SHARE OF THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN

FAIR VALUE AND BOOK VALUE FOR CLEARWIRES NET ASSETS, OF

WHICH $48 MILLION IS BEING AMORTIZED WITH A WEIGHTED

AVERAGE REMAINING LIFE OF APPROXIMATELY 18 YEARS, AND

$57 MILLION IS NOT BEING AMORTIZED AS THESE ASSETS HAVE AN

INDEFINITE USEFUL LIFE. THERE WERE NO IMPAIRMENT CHARGES RELATED

TO OUR INVESTMENT IN CLEARWIRE IN 2007 OR 2006.

WE RECOGNIZED IMPAIRMENT LOSSES ON NON-MARKETABLE EQUITY

CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS THAT POTENTIALLY SUBJECT US TO

CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK CONSIST PRINCIPALLY OF INVESTMENTS

IN DEBT INSTRUMENTS, DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, AND TRADE

RECEIVABLES. WE ALSO ENTER INTO MASTER NETTING ARRANGEMENTS WITH

COUNTERPARTIES WHEN POSSIBLE TO MITIGATE CREDIT RISK. A MASTER

NETTING ARRANGEMENT ALLOWS AMOUNTS OWED BY EACH COUNTERPARTY

FROM SEPARATE TRANSACTIONS TO BE NET SETTLED.

WE GENERALLY PLACE INVESTMENTS WITH HIGH-CREDIT-QUALITY

COUNTERPARTIES AND, BY POLICY, LIMIT THE AMOUNT OF CREDIT

EXPOSURE TO ANY ONE COUNTERPARTY BASED ON OUR PERIODIC ANALYSIS

OF THAT COUNTERPARTYS RELATIVE CREDIT STANDING.

SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR INVESTMENTS IN DEBT INSTRUMENTS ARE

WITH A/A2 OR BETTER RATED ISSUERS, AND THE SUBSTANTIAL MAJORITY

ARE WITH AA/AA2 OR BETTER. IN ADDITION TO REQUIRING ALL

INVESTMENTS WITH ORIGINAL MATURITIES OF UP TO SIX MONTHS TO BE

RATED AT LEAST

A-1/P-1

BY

STANDARD & POORS/MOODYS, OUR INVESTMENT POLICY

SPECIFIES A HIGHER MINIMUM RATING FOR INVESTMENTS WITH LONGER

MATURITIES. FOR INSTANCE, INVESTMENTS WITH MATURITIES BEYOND

THREE YEARS REQUIRE A MINIMUM RATING OF AA-/AA3. GOVERNMENT

REGULATIONS IMPOSED ON INVESTMENT ALTERNATIVES OF OUR

NON-U.S. SUBSIDIARIES,

OR THE ABSENCE OF A RATED COUNTERPARTIES IN CERTAIN COUNTRIES,

RESULT IN SOME MINOR EXCEPTIONS, WHICH ARE REVIEWED ANNUALLY BY

THE FINANCE COMMITTEE OF OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS. CREDIT RATING

CRITERIA FOR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS ARE SIMILAR TO THOSE FOR

INVESTMENTS. THE AMOUNTS SUBJECT TO CREDIT RISK RELATED TO

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS ARE GENERALLY LIMITED TO THE AMOUNTS, IF

ANY, BY WHICH A COUNTERPARTYS OBLIGATIONS EXCEED OUR

OBLIGATIONS WITH THAT COUNTERPARTY. AT DECEMBER 29, 2007,

THE TOTAL CREDIT EXPOSURE TO ANY SINGLE COUNTERPARTY DID NOT

EXCEED $500 MILLION. WE OBTAIN AND SECURE AVAILABLE

COLLATERAL FROM COUNTERPARTIES AGAINST OBLIGATIONS, INCLUDING

SECURITIES LENDING TRANSACTIONS, WHEN DEEMED APPROPRIATE.

A SUBSTANTIAL MAJORITY OF OUR TRADE RECEIVABLES ARE DERIVED FROM

SALES TO ORIGINAL EQUIPMENT MANUFACTURERS AND ORIGINAL DESIGN

MANUFACTURERS OF COMPUTER SYSTEMS, HANDHELD DEVICES, AND

NETWORKING AND COMMUNICATIONS EQUIPMENT. WE ALSO HAVE ACCOUNTS

RECEIVABLE DERIVED FROM SALES TO INDUSTRIAL AND RETAIL

DISTRIBUTORS. OUR TWO LARGEST CUSTOMERS ACCOUNTED FOR 35% OF NET

REVENUE FOR 2007, 2006, AND 2005. ADDITIONALLY, THESE TWO

LARGEST CUSTOMERS ACCOUNTED FOR 35% OF OUR ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE

AT DECEMBER 29, 2007 AND DECEMBER 30, 2006. WE BELIEVE

THAT THE RECEIVABLE BALANCES FROM THESE LARGEST CUSTOMERS DO NOT

REPRESENT A SIGNIFICANT CREDIT RISK BASED ON CASH FLOW

FORECASTS, BALANCE SHEET ANALYSIS, AND PAST COLLECTION

EXPERIENCE.

WE HAVE ADOPTED CREDIT POLICIES AND STANDARDS INTENDED TO

ACCOMMODATE INDUSTRY GROWTH AND INHERENT RISK. WE BELIEVE THAT

CREDIT RISKS ARE MODERATED BY THE FINANCIAL STABILITY OF OUR

CUSTOMERS AND DIVERSE GEOGRAPHIC SALES AREAS. WE ASSESS CREDIT

RISK THROUGH QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE ANALYSIS, AND FROM

THIS ANALYSIS, WE ESTABLISH CREDIT LIMITS AND DETERMINE WHETHER

WE WILL SEEK TO USE ONE OR MORE CREDIT SUPPORT DEVICES, SUCH AS

OBTAINING SOME FORM OF THIRD-PARTY GUARANTY OR STANDBY LETTER OF

CREDIT, OR OBTAINING CREDIT INSURANCE FOR ALL OR A PORTION OF

THE ACCOUNT BALANCE IF NECESSARY.

AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE INVESTMENTS INCLUDED $364 MILLION AS OF

DECEMBER 29, 2007 RELATED TO OUR INVESTMENT IN VMWARE, NET

EXPENSES RELATED TO OUR

NON-U.S.-CURRENCY

CAPITAL PURCHASE AND OPERATING COST HEDGING PROGRAMS (LOSSES OF

$6 MILLION IN 2006 AND GAINS OF $38 MILLION IN 2005).

WE ESTIMATE THAT WE WILL RECLASSIFY LESS THAN $45 MILLION

OF NET DERIVATIVE GAINS INCLUDED IN OTHER ACCUMULATED

COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS) INTO EARNINGS WITHIN THE NEXT

12 MONTHS. FOR ALL PERIODS PRESENTED, THE PORTION OF

HEDGING INSTRUMENTS GAINS OR LOSSES EXCLUDED FROM THE

ASSESSMENT OF EFFECTIVENESS AND THE INEFFECTIVE PORTIONS OF

HEDGES HAD AN INSIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON EARNINGS FOR CASH FLOW

HEDGES. ADDITIONALLY, FOR ALL PERIODS PRESENTED, THERE WAS NO

SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FROM DISCONTINUED

CASH FLOW HEDGES AS A RESULT OF FORECASTED TRANSACTIONS THAT DID

NOT OCCUR.

ALLOCATED A SUBSTANTIAL MAJORITY OF THIS CONSIDERATION TO

GOODWILL. THE ACQUIRED BUSINESS AND RELATED GOODWILL WAS

RECORDED WITHIN THE ALL OTHER CATEGORY FOR SEGMENT REPORTING

RESTRUCTURING AND ASSET IMPAIRMENT CHARGES

IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2006, MANAGEMENT APPROVED SEVERAL

ACTIONS THAT WERE RECOMMENDED BY OUR STRUCTURE AND EFFICIENCY

TASK FORCE AS PART OF A RESTRUCTURING PLAN DESIGNED TO IMPROVE

OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCY AND FINANCIAL RESULTS. SOME OF THESE

ACTIVITIES INVOLVE COST SAVINGS OR OTHER ACTIONS THAT DO NOT

RESULT IN RESTRUCTURING CHARGES, SUCH AS BETTER UTILIZATION OF

ASSETS, REDUCED SPENDING, AND ORGANIZATIONAL EFFICIENCIES. THE

EFFICIENCY PROGRAM INCLUDES HEADCOUNT TARGETS FOR VARIOUS GROUPS

WITHIN THE COMPANY, AND THESE TARGETS ARE BEING MET THROUGH

ONGOING EMPLOYEE ATTRITION AND TERMINATIONS. IN ADDITION,

BUSINESS DIVESTITURES FURTHER REDUCE OUR HEADCOUNT.

PROGRAM. SEE NOTE 13: DIVESTITURES FOR FURTHER

DISCUSSION. IN CONNECTION WITH THE DIVESTITURE OF CERTAIN ASSETS

OF OUR COMMUNICATIONS AND APPLICATION PROCESSOR BUSINESS, WE

RECORDED IMPAIRMENT CHARGES OF $103 MILLION RELATED TO THE

WRITE-DOWN OF MANUFACTURING TOOLS TO THEIR FAIR VALUE, LESS THE

COST TO DISPOSE OF THE ASSETS. WE DETERMINED THE FAIR VALUE

USING A MARKET-BASED VALUATION TECHNIQUE. IN ADDITION, AS A

RESULT OF BOTH THIS DIVESTITURE AND A SUBSEQUENT ASSESSMENT OF

OUR WORLDWIDE MANUFACTURING CAPACITY OPERATIONS, WE PLACED FOR

SALE THE FABRICATION FACILITY IN COLORADO SPRINGS, COLORADO.

THIS PLAN RESULTED IN AN IMPAIRMENT CHARGE OF $214 MILLION

TO WRITE DOWN TO FAIR VALUE THE LAND, BUILDING, AND EQUIPMENT

ASSET GROUPING THAT HAS BEEN PRINCIPALLY USED TO SUPPORT OUR

COMMUNICATIONS AND APPLICATION PROCESSOR BUSINESS. WE DETERMINED

THE FAIR MARKET VALUE OF THE ASSET GROUPING USING AN AVERAGE OF

THE RESULTS FROM USING THE COST APPROACH AND MARKET APPROACH

VALUATION TECHNIQUES.

DURING 2007, WE INCURRED AN ADDITIONAL $54 MILLION IN ASSET

IMPAIRMENT CHARGES AS A RESULT OF SOFTER THAN ANTICIPATED MARKET

CONDITIONS RELATED TO THE COLORADO SPRINGS FACILITY. ALSO, WE

RECORDED LAND AND BUILDING WRITE-DOWNS RELATED TO CERTAIN

FACILITIES IN SANTA CLARA, CALIFORNIA. IN ADDITION, DURING THE

FOURTH QUARTER WE INCURRED $85 MILLION IN ASSET IMPAIRMENT

CHARGES RELATED TO THE ANTICIPATED DIVESTITURE OF OUR NOR FLASH

MEMORY BUSINESS. THE IMPAIRMENT CHARGES WERE DETERMINED USING

THE REVISED FAIR VALUE, LESS SELLING COSTS, THAT WE EXPECTED TO

RECEIVE UPON COMPLETION OF THE DIVESTITURE. SEE

NOT THAT CERTAIN DEFERRED TAX ASSETS WILL NOT BE REALIZED IN THE

INCREASES IN BALANCES RELATED TO TAX POSITIONS TAKEN DURING

CURRENT PERIOD

DECEMBER 29, 2007

$794

DURING 2007, THE U.S. INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE (IRS) CLOSED ITS

EXAMINATION OF OUR TAX RETURNS FOR THE YEARS 1999 THROUGH 2002,

RESOLVING THE ISSUES RELATED TO THE TAX BENEFITS FOR EXPORT

SALES AS WELL AS A NUMBER OF OTHER ISSUES. ADDITIONALLY, WE

REACHED A SETTLEMENT WITH THE IRS FOR YEARS 2003 THROUGH 2005

WITH RESPECT TO THE TAX BENEFITS FOR EXPORT SALES. IN CONNECTION

WITH THE $739 MILLION SETTLEMENT WITH THE IRS, WE REVERSED

LONG-TERM INCOME TAXES PAYABLE, WHICH RESULTED IN A

$276 MILLION TAX BENEFIT IN 2007.

ALSO DURING 2007, WE EFFECTIVELY SETTLED WITH THE IRS ON SEVERAL

OTHER MATTERS RELATED TO THE AUDIT FOR THE 2003 AND 2004 TAX

YEARS, DESPITE THE FACT THAT THE IRS AUDIT FOR THESE YEARS

REMAINS OPEN. THE RESULT OF EFFECTIVELY SETTLING THESE POSITIONS

AND THE PROCESS OF RE-EVALUATING, BASED ON ALL AVAILABLE

INFORMATION AND CERTAIN REQUIRED REMEASUREMENTS, WAS A REDUCTION

OF $389 MILLION IN THE BALANCE OF OUR GROSS UNRECOGNIZED

TAX BENEFITS, $155 MILLION OF WHICH RESULTED IN A TAX

BENEFIT IN 2007.

IF THE REMAINING BALANCE OF $794 MILLION OF UNRECOGNIZED

TAX BENEFITS AT DECEMBER 29, 2007 WERE REALIZED IN A FUTURE

PERIOD, IT WOULD RESULT IN A TAX BENEFIT OF $754 MILLION

AND A REDUCTION OF THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE.

DURING ALL YEARS PRESENTED, WE RECOGNIZED INTEREST AND PENALTIES

RELATED TO UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS WITHIN THE PROVISION FOR

TAXES ON THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME. THEREFORE, NO

CHANGE WAS NECESSARY UPON ADOPTION OF FIN 48. IN 2007, WE

RECOGNIZED A NET BENEFIT OF $142 MILLION, PRIMARILY DUE TO

THE REVERSAL OF ACCRUED INTEREST AND PENALTIES RELATED TO THE

SETTLEMENT ACTIVITY DESCRIBED ABOVE. AS OF DECEMBER 29,

2007, WE HAD $115 MILLION, AND AS OF THE DATE OF ADOPTION

WE HAD $257 MILLION, OF ACCRUED INTEREST AND PENALTIES

RELATED TO UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS.

ALTHOUGH THE TIMING OF THE RESOLUTION AND/OR CLOSURE ON AUDITS

IS HIGHLY UNCERTAIN, IT IS REASONABLY POSSIBLE THAT THE BALANCE

OF GROSS UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS COULD SIGNIFICANTLY CHANGE IN

THE NEXT 12 MONTHS. HOWEVER, GIVEN THE NUMBER OF YEARS

REMAINING SUBJECT TO EXAMINATION AND THE NUMBER OF MATTERS BEING

EXAMINED, WE ARE UNABLE TO ESTIMATE THE RANGE OF POSSIBLE

ADJUSTMENTS TO THE BALANCE OF GROSS UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS.

WE FILE U.S. FEDERAL, U.S. STATE, AND

NON-U.S.

TAX

RETURNS. FOR U.S. STATE AND

NON-U.S.

TAX

RETURNS, WE ARE GENERALLY NO LONGER SUBJECT TO TAX EXAMINATIONS

FOR YEARS PRIOR TO 1996. FOR U.S. FEDERAL TAX RETURNS, WE ARE NO

LONGER SUBJECT TO TAX EXAMINATION FOR YEARS PRIOR TO 2003.

RETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS

PROFIT

SHARING PLANS

WE PROVIDE TAX-QUALIFIED PROFIT SHARING RETIREMENT PLANS FOR THE

BENEFIT OF ELIGIBLE EMPLOYEES, FORMER EMPLOYEES, AND RETIREES IN

THE U.S. AND CERTAIN OTHER COUNTRIES. THE PLANS ARE DESIGNED TO

PROVIDE EMPLOYEES WITH AN ACCUMULATION OF FUNDS FOR RETIREMENT

ON A TAX-DEFERRED BASIS AND PROVIDE FOR ANNUAL DISCRETIONARY

EMPLOYER CONTRIBUTIONS. OUR CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER DETERMINES

THE AMOUNTS TO BE CONTRIBUTED TO THE U.S. PROFIT SHARING PLAN

UNDER DELEGATION OF AUTHORITY FROM OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS,

PURSUANT TO THE TERMS OF THE PROFIT SHARING PLAN. AS OF

DECEMBER 29, 2007, 80% OF OUR U.S. PROFIT SHARING FUND WAS

INVESTED IN EQUITIES AND 20% WAS INVESTED IN FIXED-INCOME

INSTRUMENTS. ALL ASSETS ARE MANAGED BY EXTERNAL INVESTMENT

MANAGERS.

FOR THE BENEFIT OF ELIGIBLE U.S. EMPLOYEES, WE ALSO PROVIDE A

NON-TAX-QUALIFIED SUPPLEMENTAL DEFERRED COMPENSATION PLAN FOR

CERTAIN HIGHLY COMPENSATED EMPLOYEES. THIS PLAN IS DESIGNED TO

PERMIT CERTAIN DISCRETIONARY EMPLOYER CONTRIBUTIONS AND TO

PERMIT EMPLOYEE DEFERRAL OF A PORTION OF SALARIES IN EXCESS OF

CERTAIN TAX LIMITS AND DEFERRAL OF BONUSES. THIS PLAN IS

UNFUNDED.

WE EXPENSED $302 MILLION FOR THE QUALIFIED AND

NON-QUALIFIED U.S. PROFIT SHARING RETIREMENT PLANS IN 2007

($313 MILLION IN 2006 AND $355 MILLION IN 2005). IN

THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2008, WE FUNDED $296 MILLION FOR THE

2007 CONTRIBUTION TO THE U.S. QUALIFIED PROFIT SHARING PLAN AND

$9 MILLION FOR THE SUPPLEMENTAL DEFERRED COMPENSATION PLAN

FOR CERTAIN HIGHLY COMPENSATED EMPLOYEES.

CONTRIBUTIONS THAT WE MAKE TO THE U.S. PROFIT SHARING PLAN ON

BEHALF OF OUR EMPLOYEES VEST BASED ON THE EMPLOYEES YEARS

OF SERVICE. AS OF DECEMBER 29, 2007, EMPLOYEES VESTED AFTER

THREE YEARS OF SERVICE IN 20% ANNUAL INCREMENTS UNTIL THE

EMPLOYEE WAS 100% VESTED AFTER SEVEN YEARS, OR EARLIER IF THE

EMPLOYEE REACHED AGE 60. WE AMENDED THE U.S. PROFIT SHARING

PLAN VESTING SCHEDULE TO COMPLY WITH THE PENSION PROTECTION ACT

OF 2006 (PPA), WHICH REQUIRES EMPLOYERS TO FULLY VEST EMPLOYEES

AFTER SIX YEARS OF SERVICE. AS A RESULT, AS OF THE BEGINNING OF

2008, VESTING OCCURS AFTER TWO YEARS OF SERVICE IN 20% ANNUAL

INCREMENTS UNTIL THE EMPLOYEE IS 100% VESTED AFTER SIX YEARS, OR

EARLIER IF THE EMPLOYEE REACHES AGE 60. WE ALSO IMPLEMENTED

THIS CHANGE IN THE U.S. DEFINED-BENEFIT PLAN.

PENSION

AND POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS

EFFECTIVE AT THE END OF FISCAL YEAR 2006, WE ADOPTED THE

PROVISIONS OF SFAS NO. 158. SFAS NO. 158

REQUIRES THAT THE FUNDED STATUS OF DEFINED-BENEFIT

POSTRETIREMENT PLANS BE RECOGNIZED ON OUR CONSOLIDATED BALANCE

SHEETS, AND THAT CHANGES IN THE FUNDED STATUS BE REFLECTED IN

OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME. SFAS NO. 158 ALSO REQUIRES

THAT THE MEASUREMENT DATE OF THE PLANS FUNDED STATUS BE

THE SAME AS OUR FISCAL YEAR-END. PRIOR TO ADOPTING THE

PROVISIONS OF SFAS NO. 158, THE MEASUREMENT DATE FOR

ALL

NON-U.S.

PLANS WAS OUR FISCAL YEAR-END, AND THE MEASUREMENT DATE FOR THE

U.S. PLAN WAS NOVEMBER. THEREFORE, THE CHANGE IN MEASUREMENT

DATE HAD AN INSIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE PROJECTED BENEFIT

OBLIGATION AND ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS).

UPON ADOPTION OF SFAS NO. 158 IN 2006, WE RECORDED AN

ADJUSTMENT, NET OF TAX, OF $210 MILLION TO ACCUMULATED

OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS).

U.S. PENSION BENEFITS.

WE PROVIDE A TAX-QUALIFIED

DEFINED-BENEFIT PENSION PLAN FOR THE BENEFIT OF ELIGIBLE

EMPLOYEES AND RETIREES IN THE U.S. THE PLAN PROVIDES FOR A

MINIMUM PENSION BENEFIT THAT IS DETERMINED BY A

PARTICIPANTS YEARS OF SERVICE AND FINAL AVERAGE

COMPENSATION (TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE PARTICIPANTS SOCIAL

SECURITY WAGE BASE), REDUCED BY THE PARTICIPANTS BALANCE

IN THE U.S. PROFIT SHARING PLAN. IF THE PENSION BENEFIT EXCEEDS

THE PARTICIPANTS BALANCE IN THE U.S. PROFIT SHARING

PLAN, THE PARTICIPANT WILL RECEIVE A COMBINATION OF PENSION AND

PROFIT SHARING AMOUNTS EQUAL TO THE PENSION BENEFIT. HOWEVER,

THE PARTICIPANT WILL RECEIVE ONLY THE BENEFIT FROM THE PROFIT

SHARING PLAN IF THAT BENEFIT IS GREATER THAN THE VALUE OF THE

PENSION BENEFIT. IF WE DO NOT CONTINUE TO CONTRIBUTE TO, OR

SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE CONTRIBUTIONS TO, THE U.S. PROFIT

SHARING PLAN, THE U.S. DEFINED-BENEFIT PLAN PROJECTED BENEFIT

OBLIGATION COULD INCREASE SIGNIFICANTLY. IN 2007, WE AMENDED THE

U.S. DEFINED BENEFIT PLAN LUMP SUM CONVERSION RATES, MORTALITY

TABLES, AND MINIMUM FUNDING TARGETS TO COMPLY WITH THE PPA.

NON-U.S.

PENSION BENEFITS.

WE ALSO PROVIDE DEFINED-BENEFIT

PENSION PLANS IN CERTAIN OTHER COUNTRIES. CONSISTENT WITH THE

REQUIREMENTS OF LOCAL LAW, WE DEPOSIT FUNDS FOR CERTAIN PLANS

WITH INSURANCE COMPANIES, THIRD-PARTY TRUSTEES, OR INTO

GOVERNMENT-MANAGED ACCOUNTS, AND/OR ACCRUE FOR THE UNFUNDED

PORTION OF THE OBLIGATION. THE ASSUMPTIONS USED IN CALCULATING

THE OBLIGATION FOR THE

NON-U.S.

PLANS DEPEND ON THE LOCAL ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT.

POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL BENEFITS.

UPON RETIREMENT,

ELIGIBLE U.S. EMPLOYEES ARE CREDITED WITH A DEFINED DOLLAR

AMOUNT BASED ON YEARS OF SERVICE. THESE CREDITS CAN BE USED TO

PAY ALL OR A PORTION OF THE COST TO PURCHASE COVERAGE IN AN

INTEL-SPONSORED MEDICAL PLAN. IF THE AVAILABLE CREDITS ARE NOT

SUFFICIENT TO PAY THE ENTIRE COST OF THE COVERAGE, THE REMAINING

COST IS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE RETIREE.

FUNDING POLICY.

OUR PRACTICE IS TO FUND THE VARIOUS

PENSION PLANS IN AMOUNTS SUFFICIENT TO MEET THE MINIMUM

REQUIREMENTS OF U.S. FEDERAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS OR APPLICABLE

LOCAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS. ADDITIONAL FUNDING MAY BE PROVIDED

AS DEEMED APPROPRIATE. THE ASSETS OF THE VARIOUS PLANS ARE

INVESTED IN CORPORATE EQUITIES, CORPORATE DEBT INSTRUMENTS,

GOVERNMENT SECURITIES, AND OTHER INSTITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENTS. THE

PORTFOLIO OF EACH PLAN DEPENDS ON PLAN DESIGN AND APPLICABLE

LOCAL LAWS. DEPENDING ON THE DESIGN OF THE PLAN, LOCAL CUSTOMS,

AND MARKET CIRCUMSTANCES, THE LIABILITIES OF A PLAN MAY EXCEED

QUALIFIED PLAN ASSETS. WE ACCRUE FOR ALL SUCH LIABILITIES.

FOR THE U.S. PLAN, WE DEVELOPED THE DISCOUNT RATE BY CALCULATING

STREAMS BY YEAR TO U.S. TREASURY ZERO COUPON STRIPS TO MATCH THE

TIMING AND AMOUNT OF THE EXPECTED BENEFIT PAYMENTS. WE ADJUSTED

THE ZERO COUPON RATE BY A HISTORICAL CREDIT RISK SPREAD, AND

DISCOUNTED IT BACK TO THE MEASUREMENT DATE TO DETERMINE THE

APPROPRIATE DISCOUNT RATE. FOR THE

NON-U.S.

PLANS, WE DEVELOPED THE DISCOUNT RATE BY ANALYZING LONG-TERM

BOND RATES AND MATCHING THE BOND MATURITY WITH THE AVERAGE

DURATION OF THE PENSION LIABILITIES. WE CONSIDER SEVERAL FACTORS

IN DEVELOPING THE ASSET RETURN ASSUMPTIONS FOR THE U.S. AND

NON-U.S.

EACH PLAN IS IN EFFECT AND THE INVESTMENTS APPLICABLE TO THE

PROJECTIONS, AND THE PROJECTED RATES OF RETURN FROM INVESTMENT

MANAGERS. THE EXPECTED LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN SHOWN FOR THE

VENTURES

IN JANUARY 2006, MICRON AND INTEL FORMED IM FLASH TECHNOLOGIES,

FLASH MEMORY PRODUCTS FOR MICRON AND INTEL. WE OWN A 49%

INTEREST IN EACH OF THESE VENTURES. INITIAL PRODUCTION FROM IMFT

BEGAN IN EARLY 2006; IMFS IS IN ITS CONSTRUCTION PHASE AND HAS

CONCURRENT WITH THE FORMATION OF IMFT, WE PAID MICRON

$270 MILLION FOR PRODUCT DESIGNS THAT MICRON DEVELOPED AS

WELL AS CERTAIN OTHER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY. WE OWN THE RIGHTS

TO ALL PRODUCT DESIGNS AND HAVE LICENSED THE DESIGNS TO MICRON.

MICRON PAID INTEL $40 MILLION TO LICENSE THESE INITIAL

PRODUCT DESIGNS AND WILL PAY ADDITIONAL ROYALTIES ON NEW PRODUCT

DESIGNS. WE RECORDED OUR NET INVESTMENT IN THIS TECHNOLOGY OF

$230 MILLION AS AN IDENTIFIED INTANGIBLE ASSET, WHICH WE

INCLUDED IN THE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY ASSET CLASSIFICATION. THE

IDENTIFIED INTANGIBLE ASSET IS BEING AMORTIZED INTO COST OF

SALES OVER ITS EXPECTED FIVE-YEAR LIFE. COSTS THAT INTEL AND

MICRON HAVE INCURRED FOR PRODUCT AND PROCESS DEVELOPMENT RELATED

TO IMFT ARE GENERALLY SPLIT EVENLY BETWEEN INTEL AND MICRON AND

ARE CLASSIFIED IN R&D.

SUBJECT TO CERTAIN CONDITIONS, WE AGREED TO CONTRIBUTE UP TO

APPROXIMATELY $1.4 BILLION FOR IMFT AND UP TO APPROXIMATELY

$1.7 BILLION FOR IMFS IN THE THREE YEARS FOLLOWING THE

INITIAL CAPITAL CONTRIBUTIONS. OF THESE AMOUNTS, AS OF

DECEMBER 29, 2007, OUR REMAINING COMMITMENT WAS

APPROXIMATELY $260 MILLION FOR IMFT AND APPROXIMATELY

$1.5 BILLION FOR IMFS. ADDITIONALLY, OUR PORTION OF IMFT

COSTS, PRIMARILY RELATED TO PRODUCT PURCHASES AND

START-UP,

WAS APPROXIMATELY $790 MILLION DURING 2007 (APPROXIMATELY

$300 MILLION DURING 2006). THE AMOUNT DUE TO IMFT FOR

PRODUCT PURCHASES AND SERVICES PROVIDED WAS APPROXIMATELY

$130 MILLION AS OF DECEMBER 29, 2007 AND WAS NOT

SIGNIFICANT AS OF DECEMBER 30, 2006.

IMFT AND IMFS ARE EACH GOVERNED BY A BOARD OF MANAGERS, WITH

MICRON AND INTEL INITIALLY APPOINTING AN EQUAL NUMBER OF

MANAGERS TO EACH OF THE BOARDS. THE NUMBER OF MANAGERS APPOINTED

BY EACH PARTY ADJUSTS DEPENDING ON THE PARTIES OWNERSHIP

INTERESTS. THESE VENTURES WILL OPERATE UNTIL 2016, BUT ARE

SUBJECT TO PRIOR TERMINATION UNDER CERTAIN TERMS AND CONDITIONS.

THESE JOINT VENTURES ARE VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES AS DEFINED

BY FASB INTERPRETATION NO. 46(R), CONSOLIDATION OF

VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES (FIN 46(R)), BECAUSE ALL

POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE VARIANCES IN COST STRUCTURE WILL BE PASSED

ON TO MICRON AND INTEL THROUGH OUR PURCHASE AGREEMENTS. HOWEVER,

WE HAVE DETERMINED THAT WE ARE NOT THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY OF

THESE JOINT VENTURES, AND AS SUCH, WE ACCOUNT FOR OUR INTERESTS

USING THE EQUITY METHOD OF ACCOUNTING AND DO NOT CONSOLIDATE

THESE JOINT VENTURES. MICRON AND INTEL ARE ALSO CONSIDERED

RELATED PARTIES UNDER THE PROVISIONS OF FIN 46(R).

WE HAVE ENTERED INTO A LONG-TERM AGREEMENT WITH APPLE, INC. TO

SUPPLY A PORTION OF THE NAND FLASH MEMORY OUTPUT THAT WE WILL

TAX

MATTERS

IN CONNECTION WITH THE REGULAR EXAMINATION OF OUR TAX RETURNS

FOR THE YEARS 1999 THROUGH 2005, THE IRS HAD FORMALLY ASSESSED

ADJUSTMENTS TO THE AMOUNTS THAT WE HAD RECORDED ON THOSE RETURNS

AS A TAX BENEFIT FOR EXPORT SALES. IN 2007, WE RESOLVED THESE

MATTERS WITH THE IRS. SEE NOTE 17: TAXES FOR

FURTHER DISCUSSION.

LEGAL

PROCEEDINGS

WE ARE CURRENTLY A PARTY TO VARIOUS LEGAL PROCEEDINGS, INCLUDING

THOSE NOTED IN THIS SECTION. WHILE MANAGEMENT PRESENTLY BELIEVES

THAT THE ULTIMATE OUTCOME OF THESE PROCEEDINGS, INDIVIDUALLY AND

IN THE AGGREGATE, WILL NOT MATERIALLY HARM THE COMPANYS

FINANCIAL POSITION, CASH FLOWS, OR OVERALL TRENDS IN RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS, LITIGATION IS SUBJECT TO INHERENT UNCERTAINTIES, AND

UNFAVORABLE RULINGS COULD OCCUR. AN UNFAVORABLE RULING COULD

INCLUDE MONEY DAMAGES OR, IN CASES FOR WHICH INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

IS SOUGHT, AN INJUNCTION PROHIBITING US FROM SELLING ONE OR MORE

PRODUCTS AT ALL OR IN PARTICULAR WAYS. WERE AN UNFAVORABLE

RULING TO OCCUR, OUR BUSINESS OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COULD BE

MATERIALLY HARMED.

KABUSHIKI KAISHA, AND RELATED CONSUMER CLASS ACTIONS AND

GOVERNMENT INVESTIGATIONS

IN JUNE 2005, AMD FILED A COMPLAINT IN THE UNITED STATES

DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE ALLEGING THAT WE AND

OUR JAPANESE SUBSIDIARY ENGAGED IN VARIOUS ACTIONS IN VIOLATION

OF THE SHERMAN ACT AND THE CALIFORNIA BUSINESS AND PROFESSIONS

CODE, INCLUDING PROVIDING SECRET AND DISCRIMINATORY DISCOUNTS

AND REBATES AND INTENTIONALLY INTERFERING WITH PROSPECTIVE

BUSINESS ADVANTAGES OF AMD. AMDS COMPLAINT SEEKS

UNSPECIFIED TREBLE DAMAGES, PUNITIVE DAMAGES, AN INJUNCTION, AND

ATTORNEYS FEES AND COSTS. SUBSEQUENTLY, AMDS

JAPANESE SUBSIDIARY ALSO FILED SUITS IN THE TOKYO HIGH COURT AND

THE TOKYO DISTRICT COURT AGAINST OUR JAPANESE SUBSIDIARY,

ASSERTING VIOLATIONS OF JAPANS ANTIMONOPOLY LAW AND

ALLEGING DAMAGES IN EACH SUIT OF APPROXIMATELY $55 MILLION,

PLUS VARIOUS OTHER COSTS AND FEES. AT LEAST 83 SEPARATE CLASS

ACTIONS HAVE BEEN FILED IN THE U.S. DISTRICT COURTS FOR THE

NORTHERN DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA, SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF

CALIFORNIA, DISTRICT OF IDAHO, DISTRICT OF NEBRASKA, DISTRICT OF

NEW MEXICO, DISTRICT OF MAINE, AND THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE, AS

WELL AS IN VARIOUS CALIFORNIA, KANSAS, AND TENNESSEE STATE

COURTS. THESE ACTIONS GENERALLY REPEAT AMDS ALLEGATIONS

AND ASSERT VARIOUS CONSUMER INJURIES, INCLUDING THAT CONSUMERS

IN VARIOUS STATES HAVE BEEN INJURED BY PAYING HIGHER PRICES FOR

COMPUTERS CONTAINING OUR MICROPROCESSORS. ALL OF THE FEDERAL

CLASS ACTIONS AND THE KANSAS AND TENNESSEE STATE COURT CLASS

ACTIONS HAVE BEEN OR WILL BE CONSOLIDATED BY THE MULTIDISTRICT

LITIGATION PANEL TO THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE. ALL CALIFORNIA

CLASS ACTIONS HAVE BEEN CONSOLIDATED TO THE SUPERIOR COURT OF

CALIFORNIA IN SANTA CLARA COUNTY. WE DISPUTE AMDS CLAIMS

AND THE

CLASS-ACTION

CLAIMS, AND INTEND TO DEFEND THE LAWSUITS VIGOROUSLY.

WE ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO CERTAIN ANTITRUST REGULATORY INQUIRIES.

IN 2001, THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION COMMENCED AN INVESTIGATION

REGARDING CLAIMS BY AMD THAT WE USED UNFAIR BUSINESS PRACTICES

TO PERSUADE CLIENTS TO BUY OUR MICROPROCESSORS. THE EUROPEAN

COMMISSION SENT US A STATEMENT OF OBJECTIONS IN JULY 2007

ALLEGING THAT CERTAIN INTEL MARKETING AND PRICING PRACTICES

AMOUNTED TO AN ABUSE OF A DOMINANT POSITION THAT INFRINGED

EUROPEAN LAW. THE STATEMENT RECOGNIZED THAT SUCH ALLEGATIONS

WERE PRELIMINARY, NOT FINAL, CONCLUSIONS. WE RESPONDED TO THOSE

ALLEGATIONS IN JANUARY 2008. WE INTEND TO CONTEST THIS MATTER

VIGOROUSLY IN THE ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE, WHICH HAS NOW BEGUN

AND, IF NECESSARY, IN EUROPEAN COURTS. ON FEBRUARY 12,

2008, THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION INITIATED AN INSPECTION OF

DOCUMENTS AT OUR FELDKIRCHEN, GERMANY OFFICES, AND WE ARE

COOPERATING WITH THE INVESTIGATION.

SUBSIDIARY RELATED TO MARKETING AND REBATE PROGRAMS THAT WE

ENTERED INTO WITH KOREAN PC MANUFACTURERS. IN SEPTEMBER 2007,

THE KFTC SERVED US AN EXAMINATION REPORT ALLEGING THAT SALES TO

TWO CUSTOMERS DURING PARTS OF 20022005 VIOLATED

KOREAS MONOPOLY REGULATION AND FAIR TRADE ACT. IN DECEMBER

2007, WE SUBMITTED OUR WRITTEN RESPONSE TO THE KFTC. WE INTEND

TO CONTEST THIS MATTER VIGOROUSLY IN THE ADMINISTRATIVE

IN JANUARY 2008, WE RECEIVED A SUBPOENA FROM THE ATTORNEY

IN JUNE 2002, VARIOUS PLAINTIFFS FILED A LAWSUIT IN THE THIRD

JUDICIAL CIRCUIT COURT, MADISON COUNTY, ILLINOIS, AGAINST INTEL,

ALLEGING THAT THE DEFENDANTS ADVERTISEMENTS AND STATEMENTS

MISLED THE PUBLIC BY SUPPRESSING AND CONCEALING THE ALLEGED

MATERIAL FACT THAT SYSTEMS CONTAINING

PROCESSORS AND A COMPETITORS MICROPROCESSORS. IN JULY

2004, THE COURT CERTIFIED AGAINST US AN ILLINOIS-ONLY CLASS OF

CERTAIN END-USE PURCHASERS OF CERTAIN PENTIUM 4 PROCESSORS OR

COMPUTERS CONTAINING THESE MICROPROCESSORS. IN JANUARY 2005, THE

COURT GRANTED A MOTION FILED JOINTLY BY THE PLAINTIFFS AND INTEL

THAT STAYED THE PROCEEDINGS IN THE TRIAL COURT PENDING

DISCRETIONARY APPELLATE REVIEW OF THE COURTS CLASS

CERTIFICATION ORDER. IN JULY 2006, THE ILLINOIS APPELLATE COURT,

FIFTH DISTRICT, VACATED THE TRIAL COURTS CLASS

CERTIFICATION ORDER. THE APPELLATE COURT INSTRUCTED THE TRIAL

COURT TO RECONSIDER WHETHER CALIFORNIA LAW SHOULD APPLY.

HOWEVER, IN AUGUST 2006, THE ILLINOIS SUPREME COURT AGREED TO

REVIEW THE APPELLATE COURTS DECISION. IN NOVEMBER 2007,

THE ILLINOIS SUPREME COURT ISSUED ITS OPINION FINDING IN FAVOR

OF INTEL ON TWO ISSUES. FIRST, ON THE ISSUE OF WHETHER ILLINOIS

OR CALIFORNIA LAW APPLIES TO THE CLAIMS OF ILLINOIS RESIDENTS

FOR GOODS PURCHASED IN ILLINOIS, THE COURT FOUND THAT ILLINOIS

LAW APPLIES, REJECTING THE APPELLATE COURTS FINDING OF A

NATIONWIDE CLASS BASED ON THE APPLICATION OF CALIFORNIA LAW.

SECOND, ON THE ISSUE OF WHETHER ANY CLASS SHOULD BE CERTIFIED IN

THIS CASE AT ALL, THE COURT HELD THAT NO CLASS SHOULD BE

CERTIFIED, REVERSING THE TRIAL COURTS FINDING OF AN

ILLINOIS-ONLY CLASS BASED ON ILLINOIS LAW. THE CASE HAS BEEN

REMANDED TO THE TRIAL COURT.

THOSE BOARD-SANCTIONED ACTIVITIES HAVE HARMED THE COMPANY. THE

AS OF DECEMBER 29, 2007, OUR OPERATING SEGMENTS INCLUDED

THE DIGITAL ENTERPRISE GROUP, MOBILITY GROUP, NAND PRODUCTS

GROUP, FLASH MEMORY GROUP, DIGITAL HOME GROUP, DIGITAL HEALTH

GROUP, AND SOFTWARE AND SOLUTIONS GROUP. IN THE FOURTH QUARTER

OF 2007, WE MADE ORGANIZATIONAL CHANGES THAT RESULTED IN THE

FORMATION OF THE NAND PRODUCTS GROUP OPERATING SEGMENT, WHICH

INCLUDES THE NAND FLASH MEMORY BUSINESS THAT WAS PREVIOUSLY

INCLUDED IN THE FLASH MEMORY GROUP OPERATING SEGMENT. THE FLASH

MEMORY GROUP OPERATING SEGMENT INCLUDES SALES OF NOR FLASH

MEMORY PRODUCTS. DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2008, WE EXPECT TO

COMPLETE THE DIVESTITURE OF OUR NOR FLASH MEMORY ASSETS TO

NUMONYX. WE EXPECT TO ENTER INTO SUPPLY AND TRANSITION SERVICE

AGREEMENTS TO PROVIDE PRODUCTS, SERVICES, AND SUPPORT TO NUMONYX

FOLLOWING THE CLOSE OF THE TRANSACTION. SEE NOTE 13.

WE REPORT THE FINANCIAL RESULTS OF THE FOLLOWING OPERATING

SEGMENTS.

DIGITAL ENTERPRISE GROUP.

INCLUDES MICROPROCESSORS

AND RELATED CHIPSETS AND MOTHERBOARDS DESIGNED FOR THE DESKTOP

AND ENTERPRISE COMPUTING MARKET SEGMENTS; COMMUNICATIONS

INFRASTRUCTURE COMPONENTS SUCH AS NETWORK PROCESSORS,

COMMUNICATIONS BOARDS, AND EMBEDDED PROCESSORS; WIRED

CONNECTIVITY DEVICES; AND PRODUCTS FOR NETWORK AND SERVER

STORAGE.



MOBILITY GROUP.

INCLUDES MICROPROCESSORS AND RELATED

CHIPSETS DESIGNED FOR THE NOTEBOOK MARKET SEGMENT, WIRELESS

CONNECTIVITY PRODUCTS, AND PRODUCTS DESIGNED FOR THE

ULTRA-MOBILE MARKET SEGMENT. IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2006, WE

COMPLETED THE SALE OF CERTAIN ASSETS OF OUR COMMUNICATIONS AND

APPLICATION PROCESSOR BUSINESS LINES TO MARVELL. RELATED TO THE

SALE, WE ENTERED INTO A MANUFACTURING AND TRANSITION SERVICES

AGREEMENT WITH MARVELL. AS A RESULT, OUR SALES OF APPLICATION

AND CELLULAR BASEBAND PROCESSORS IN 2007 WERE ONLY TO MARVELL.

THE NAND PRODUCTS GROUP, FLASH MEMORY GROUP, DIGITAL HOME GROUP,

WE HAVE SALES AND MARKETING, MANUFACTURING, FINANCE, AND

IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2007, WE STARTED INCLUDING SHARE-BASED

COMPENSATION IN THE COMPUTATION OF OPERATING INCOME (LOSS) FOR

EACH OPERATING SEGMENT AND ADJUSTED PRIOR RESULTS TO REFLECT

THIS CHANGE. REVENUE FOR THE ALL OTHER CATEGORY IS PRIMARILY

RELATED TO THE SALE OF NOR FLASH MEMORY PRODUCTS, NAND FLASH

SEGMENTS DO NOT RECORD INTER-SEGMENT REVENUE, AND, ACCORDINGLY,

THERE IS NONE TO BE REPORTED. WE DO NOT ALLOCATE INTEREST AND

OTHER INCOME, INTEREST EXPENSE, OR TAXES TO OPERATING SEGMENTS.

WE HAVE AUDITED THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS OF

INTEL CORPORATION AS OF DECEMBER 29, 2007 AND

DECEMBER 30, 2006, AND THE RELATED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS

OF INCOME, STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY, AND CASH FLOWS FOR EACH OF

THE THREE YEARS IN THE PERIOD ENDED DECEMBER 29, 2007. OUR

AUDITS ALSO INCLUDED THE FINANCIAL STATEMENT SCHEDULE LISTED IN

THE INDEX AT PART IV, ITEM 15. THESE FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS AND SCHEDULE ARE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE

COMPANYS MANAGEMENT. OUR RESPONSIBILITY IS TO EXPRESS AN

OPINION ON THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SCHEDULE BASED ON OUR

AUDITS.

WE CONDUCTED OUR AUDITS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE STANDARDS OF THE

PUBLIC COMPANY ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BOARD (UNITED STATES). THOSE

STANDARDS REQUIRE THAT WE PLAN AND PERFORM THE AUDIT TO OBTAIN

REASONABLE ASSURANCE ABOUT WHETHER THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE

FREE OF MATERIAL MISSTATEMENT. AN AUDIT INCLUDES EXAMINING, ON A

TEST BASIS, EVIDENCE SUPPORTING THE AMOUNTS AND DISCLOSURES IN

THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. AN AUDIT ALSO INCLUDES ASSESSING THE

ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES USED AND SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES MADE BY

MANAGEMENT, AS WELL AS EVALUATING THE OVERALL FINANCIAL

STATEMENT PRESENTATION. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR AUDITS PROVIDE A

REASONABLE BASIS FOR OUR OPINION.

IN OUR OPINION, THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS REFERRED TO ABOVE

PRESENT FAIRLY, IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS, THE CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL POSITION OF INTEL CORPORATION AT DECEMBER 29,

2007 AND DECEMBER 30, 2006, AND THE CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF

ITS OPERATIONS AND ITS CASH FLOWS FOR EACH OF THE THREE YEARS IN

THE PERIOD ENDED DECEMBER 29, 2007, IN CONFORMITY WITH

U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES. ALSO, IN OUR

OPINION, THE RELATED FINANCIAL STATEMENT SCHEDULE, WHEN

CONSIDERED IN RELATION TO THE BASIC FINANCIAL STATEMENTS TAKEN

AS A WHOLE, PRESENTS FAIRLY IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS THE

INFORMATION SET FORTH THEREIN.

AS DISCUSSED IN NOTES 2, 17 AND 18 TO THE CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, INTEL CORPORATION CHANGED ITS METHOD OF

ACCOUNTING FOR SABBATICAL LEAVE AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2006,

ITS METHOD OF ACCOUNTING FOR UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2006, ITS METHOD OF ACCOUNTING FOR ITS DEFINED

THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND STOCKHOLDERS, INTEL

WE HAVE AUDITED INTEL CORPORATIONS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER

FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF DECEMBER 29, 2007, BASED ON

CRITERIA ESTABLISHED IN INTERNAL CONTROLINTEGRATED

FRAMEWORK ISSUED BY THE COMMITTEE OF SPONSORING ORGANIZATIONS OF

THE TREADWAY COMMISSION (THE COSO CRITERIA). INTEL

CORPORATIONS MANAGEMENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR MAINTAINING

EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, AND FOR ITS

ASSESSMENT OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER

FINANCIAL REPORTING INCLUDED IN THE ACCOMPANYING MANAGEMENT

REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING. OUR

RESPONSIBILITY IS TO EXPRESS AN OPINION ON THE COMPANYS

INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING BASED ON OUR AUDIT.

WE CONDUCTED OUR AUDIT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE STANDARDS OF THE

PUBLIC COMPANY ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BOARD (UNITED STATES). THOSE

STANDARDS REQUIRE THAT WE PLAN AND PERFORM THE AUDIT TO OBTAIN

REASONABLE ASSURANCE ABOUT WHETHER EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL

OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING WAS MAINTAINED IN ALL MATERIAL

RESPECTS. OUR AUDIT INCLUDED OBTAINING AN UNDERSTANDING OF

INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, ASSESSING THE RISK

THAT A MATERIAL WEAKNESS EXISTS, TESTING AND EVALUATING THE

DESIGN AND OPERATING EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL CONTROL BASED ON

THE ASSESSED RISK, AND PERFORMING SUCH OTHER PROCEDURES AS WE

CONSIDERED NECESSARY IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR

AUDIT PROVIDES A REASONABLE BASIS FOR OUR OPINION.

A COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING IS A

PROCESS DESIGNED TO PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING THE

RELIABILITY OF FINANCIAL REPORTING AND THE PREPARATION OF

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR EXTERNAL PURPOSES IN ACCORDANCE WITH

GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES. A COMPANYS

INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING INCLUDES THOSE

POLICIES AND PROCEDURES THAT (1) PERTAIN TO THE MAINTENANCE

OF RECORDS THAT, IN REASONABLE DETAIL, ACCURATELY AND FAIRLY

REFLECT THE TRANSACTIONS AND DISPOSITIONS OF THE ASSETS OF THE

COMPANY; (2) PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE THAT TRANSACTIONS

ARE RECORDED AS NECESSARY TO PERMIT PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING

PRINCIPLES, AND THAT RECEIPTS AND EXPENDITURES OF THE COMPANY

ARE BEING MADE ONLY IN ACCORDANCE WITH AUTHORIZATIONS OF

MANAGEMENT AND DIRECTORS OF THE COMPANY; AND (3) PROVIDE

REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING PREVENTION OR TIMELY DETECTION OF

UNAUTHORIZED ACQUISITION, USE, OR DISPOSITION OF THE

COMPANYS ASSETS THAT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

BECAUSE OF ITS INHERENT LIMITATIONS, INTERNAL CONTROL OVER

FINANCIAL REPORTING MAY NOT PREVENT OR DETECT MISSTATEMENTS.

ALSO, PROJECTIONS OF ANY EVALUATION OF EFFECTIVENESS TO FUTURE

PERIODS ARE SUBJECT TO THE RISK THAT CONTROLS MAY BECOME

INADEQUATE BECAUSE OF CHANGES IN CONDITIONS, OR THAT THE DEGREE

OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE POLICIES OR PROCEDURES MAY DETERIORATE.

IN OUR OPINION, INTEL CORPORATION MAINTAINED, IN ALL MATERIAL

RESPECTS, EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS

OF DECEMBER 29, 2007, BASED ON THE COSO CRITERIA.

WE ALSO HAVE AUDITED, IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE STANDARDS OF THE

PUBLIC COMPANY ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BOARD (UNITED STATES), THE

2007 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF INTEL CORPORATION AND

OUR REPORT DATED FEBRUARY 19, 2008 EXPRESSED AN UNQUALIFIED

OPINION THEREON.

CONTROLS

AND PROCEDURES

EVALUATION

OF DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

BASED ON MANAGEMENTS EVALUATION (WITH THE PARTICIPATION OF

OUR CEO AND CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER (CFO)), AS OF THE END OF THE

PERIOD COVERED BY THIS REPORT, OUR CEO AND CFO HAVE CONCLUDED

THAT OUR DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES (AS DEFINED IN

RULES 13A-15(E)

AND

15D-15(E)

UNDER THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934, AS AMENDED (THE

EXCHANGE ACT)), ARE EFFECTIVE TO PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE

THAT INFORMATION REQUIRED TO BE DISCLOSED BY US IN REPORTS THAT

WE FILE OR SUBMIT UNDER THE EXCHANGE ACT IS RECORDED, PROCESSED,

SUMMARIZED, AND REPORTED WITHIN THE TIME PERIODS SPECIFIED IN

SEC RULES AND FORMS, AND IS ACCUMULATED AND COMMUNICATED TO

MANAGEMENT, INCLUDING OUR PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND

PRINCIPAL FINANCIAL OFFICER, AS APPROPRIATE TO ALLOW TIMELY

DECISIONS REGARDING REQUIRED DISCLOSURE.

CHANGES

IN INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

THERE WERE NO CHANGES TO OUR INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL

REPORTING (AS DEFINED IN

RULES 13A-15(F)

AND

15D-15(F)

UNDER THE EXCHANGE ACT) THAT OCCURRED DURING THE PERIOD COVERED

BY THIS REPORT THAT HAVE MATERIALLY AFFECTED, OR ARE REASONABLY

LIKELY TO MATERIALLY AFFECT, OUR INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL

REPORTING.

MANAGEMENT

REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

OUR MANAGEMENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ESTABLISHING AND MAINTAINING

ADEQUATE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING (AS DEFINED

IN

RULES 13A-15(F)

AND

15D-15(F)

UNDER THE EXCHANGE ACT) TO PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE

REGARDING THE RELIABILITY OF OUR FINANCIAL REPORTING AND THE

PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR EXTERNAL PURPOSES IN

ACCORDANCE WITH U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING

PRINCIPLES.

MANAGEMENT ASSESSED OUR INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL

REPORTING AS OF DECEMBER 29, 2007, THE END OF OUR FISCAL

YEAR. MANAGEMENT BASED ITS ASSESSMENT ON CRITERIA ESTABLISHED IN

INTERNAL CONTROLINTEGRATED FRAMEWORK ISSUED BY THE

COMMITTEE OF SPONSORING ORGANIZATIONS OF THE TREADWAY

COMMISSION. MANAGEMENTS ASSESSMENT INCLUDED EVALUATION OF

ELEMENTS SUCH AS THE DESIGN AND OPERATING EFFECTIVENESS OF KEY

FINANCIAL REPORTING CONTROLS, PROCESS DOCUMENTATION, ACCOUNTING

POLICIES, AND OUR OVERALL CONTROL ENVIRONMENT.

BASED ON OUR ASSESSMENT, MANAGEMENT HAS CONCLUDED THAT OUR

INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING WAS EFFECTIVE AS OF

THE END OF THE FISCAL YEAR TO PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE

REGARDING THE RELIABILITY OF FINANCIAL REPORTING AND THE

PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR EXTERNAL REPORTING

PURPOSES IN ACCORDANCE WITH U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED

ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES. WE REVIEWED THE RESULTS OF

MANAGEMENTS ASSESSMENT WITH THE AUDIT COMMITTEE OF OUR

BOARD OF DIRECTORS.

OUR INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM,

ERNST & YOUNG LLP, INDEPENDENTLY ASSESSED THE

EFFECTIVENESS OF THE COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER

FINANCIAL REPORTING. ERNST & YOUNG HAS ISSUED AN

ATTESTATION REPORT CONCURRING WITH MANAGEMENTS ASSESSMENT,

WHICH IS INCLUDED AT THE END OF PART II, ITEM 8 OF

THIS

FORM 10-K.

INHERENT

LIMITATIONS ON EFFECTIVENESS OF CONTROLS

OUR MANAGEMENT, INCLUDING THE CEO AND CFO, DOES NOT EXPECT THAT

OUR DISCLOSURE CONTROLS OR OUR INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL

REPORTING WILL PREVENT OR DETECT ALL ERROR AND ALL FRAUD. A

CONTROL SYSTEM, NO MATTER HOW WELL DESIGNED AND OPERATED, CAN

PROVIDE ONLY REASONABLE, NOT ABSOLUTE, ASSURANCE THAT THE

CONTROL SYSTEMS OBJECTIVES WILL BE MET. THE DESIGN OF A

CONTROL SYSTEM MUST REFLECT THE FACT THAT THERE ARE RESOURCE

CONSTRAINTS, AND THE BENEFITS OF CONTROLS MUST BE CONSIDERED

RELATIVE TO THEIR COSTS. FURTHER, BECAUSE OF THE INHERENT

LIMITATIONS IN ALL CONTROL SYSTEMS, NO EVALUATION OF CONTROLS

CAN PROVIDE ABSOLUTE ASSURANCE THAT MISSTATEMENTS DUE TO ERROR

OR FRAUD WILL NOT OCCUR OR THAT ALL CONTROL ISSUES AND INSTANCES

OF FRAUD, IF ANY, HAVE BEEN DETECTED. THESE INHERENT LIMITATIONS

INCLUDE THE REALITIES THAT JUDGMENTS IN

DECISION-MAKING

CAN BE FAULTY AND THAT BREAKDOWNS CAN OCCUR BECAUSE OF SIMPLE

ERROR OR MISTAKE. CONTROLS CAN ALSO BE CIRCUMVENTED BY THE

INDIVIDUAL ACTS OF SOME PERSONS, BY COLLUSION OF TWO OR MORE

PEOPLE, OR BY MANAGEMENT OVERRIDE OF THE CONTROLS. THE DESIGN OF

ANY SYSTEM OF CONTROLS IS BASED IN PART ON CERTAIN ASSUMPTIONS

ABOUT THE LIKELIHOOD OF FUTURE EVENTS, AND THERE CAN BE NO

ASSURANCE THAT ANY DESIGN WILL SUCCEED IN ACHIEVING ITS STATED

GOALS UNDER ALL POTENTIAL FUTURE CONDITIONS. PROJECTIONS OF ANY

EVALUATION OF CONTROLS EFFECTIVENESS TO FUTURE PERIODS ARE

SUBJECT TO RISKS. OVER TIME, CONTROLS MAY BECOME INADEQUATE

BECAUSE OF CHANGES IN CONDITIONS OR DETERIORATION IN THE DEGREE

OF COMPLIANCE WITH POLICIES OR PROCEDURES.
