COMPANY

OVERVIEW

WE ARE THE WORLDS LARGEST SEMICONDUCTOR CHIP MAKER, BASED

ON REVENUE. WE DEVELOP ADVANCED INTEGRATED DIGITAL TECHNOLOGY,

PRIMARILY INTEGRATED CIRCUITS, FOR INDUSTRIES SUCH AS COMPUTING

AND COMMUNICATIONS. INTEGRATED CIRCUITS ARE SEMICONDUCTOR CHIPS

ETCHED WITH INTERCONNECTED ELECTRONIC SWITCHES. WE ALSO DEVELOP

COMPUTING PLATFORMS, WHICH WE DEFINE AS INTEGRATED HARDWARE AND

SOFTWARE COMPUTING TECHNOLOGIES THAT ARE DESIGNED TO PROVIDE AN

OPTIMIZED SOLUTION. OUR GOAL IS TO BE THE PREEMINENT COMPUTING

SOLUTIONS COMPANY THAT POWERS THE WORLDWIDE DIGITAL ECONOMY. WE

ARE TRANSFORMING FROM A COMPANY WITH A PRIMARY FOCUS ON THE

DESIGN AND MANUFACTURE OF SEMICONDUCTOR CHIPS FOR PCS AND

SERVERS TO A COMPUTING COMPANY THAT DELIVERS COMPLETE SOLUTIONS

IN THE FORM OF HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE PLATFORMS AND SUPPORTING

SERVICES.

WE WERE INCORPORATED IN CALIFORNIA IN 1968 AND REINCORPORATED IN

DELAWARE IN 1989.

IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2011, WE COMPLETED THE ACQUISITION OF

THE WIRELESS SOLUTIONS (WLS) BUSINESS OF INFINEON TECHNOLOGIES

PRODUCTS

WE DESIGN AND MANUFACTURE COMPUTING AND COMMUNICATIONS

COMPONENTS, SUCH AS MICROPROCESSORS, CHIPSETS, MOTHERBOARDS, AND

WIRELESS AND WIRED CONNECTIVITY PRODUCTS. OUR PLATFORMS

INCORPORATE SOFTWARE TO ENABLE AND ADVANCE THESE COMPONENTS. WE

STRIVE TO OPTIMIZE THE OVERALL PERFORMANCE OF OUR PRODUCTS BY

IMPROVING ENERGY EFFICIENCY, SEAMLESS CONNECTIVITY TO THE

INTERNET, AND SECURITY FEATURES. IMPROVED ENERGY EFFICIENCY IS

ACHIEVED BY LOWERING POWER CONSUMPTION IN RELATION TO

PERFORMANCE CAPABILITIES, AND MAY RESULT IN LONGER BATTERY LIFE,

REDUCED SYSTEM HEAT OUTPUT, POWER SAVINGS, AND LOWER TOTAL COST

OF OWNERSHIP. INCREASED PERFORMANCE CAN INCLUDE FASTER

PROCESSING PERFORMANCE AND OTHER IMPROVED CAPABILITIES, SUCH AS

MULTITHREADING, MULTITASKING, AND PROCESSOR GRAPHICS.

PERFORMANCE CAN ALSO BE IMPROVED BY ENHANCING INTEROPERABILITY

AMONG DEVICES, STORAGE, MANAGEABILITY, UTILIZATION, RELIABILITY,

AND EASE OF USE.

OUR VISION IS TO CREATE A CONTINUUM OF PERSONAL COMPUTING

EXPERIENCES BASED ON

INTEL

®

ARCHITECTURE. THIS CONTINUUM WOULD GIVE CONSUMERS A SET OF

SECURE, CONSISTENT, AND PERSONALIZED COMPUTING EXPERIENCES WITH

A VARIETY OF DEVICES THAT CONNECT TO THE INTERNET AND EACH

OTHER. OUR GOAL IS TO PROVIDE CONSISTENCY AND INTEROPERABILITY

BETWEEN DEVICES THAT ARE CONNECTED SEAMLESSLY AND REQUIRE

COMPUTING CAPABILITY BOTH LOCALLY AND IN CLOUD COMPUTING. CLOUD

COMPUTING IS A GROUP OF LINKED SERVERS THAT PROVIDES A VARIETY

OF APPLICATIONS AND DATA TO USERS OVER THE INTERNET.

COMPONENTS

MICROPROCESSORS

A MICROPROCESSORTHE CENTRAL PROCESSING UNIT (CPU) OF A

COMPUTER SYSTEMPROCESSES SYSTEM DATA AND CONTROLS OTHER

DEVICES IN THE SYSTEM. WE OFFER MICROPROCESSORS WITH ONE OR

MULTIPLE PROCESSOR CORES DESIGNED FOR NOTEBOOKS, NETBOOKS,

DESKTOPS, SERVERS, WORKSTATIONS, STORAGE PRODUCTS, EMBEDDED

APPLICATIONS, COMMUNICATIONS PRODUCTS, CONSUMER ELECTRONICS

DEVICES, AND HANDHELD DEVICES. MULTI-CORE MICROPROCESSORS CAN

ENABLE IMPROVED MULTITASKING AND ENERGY-EFFICIENT PERFORMANCE BY

DISTRIBUTING COMPUTING TASKS ACROSS TWO OR MORE CORES.

1

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE MAJORITY OF OUR MICROPROCESSORS ARE MANUFACTURED USING OUR

32-NANOMETER (NM) SECOND-GENERATION HI-K METAL GATE SILICON

PROCESS TECHNOLOGY (32NM PROCESS TECHNOLOGY). THE USE OF HI-K

METAL GATE TRANSISTORS INCREASES PERFORMANCE WHILE

SIMULTANEOUSLY REDUCING THE LEAKAGE OF ELECTRICAL CURRENT. IN

DECEMBER 2010, WE INTRODUCED THE 2ND GENERATION

INTEL

®

CORE

TM

PROCESSOR FAMILY (FORMERLY CODE-NAMED SANDY BRIDGE), A NEW

MICROARCHITECTURE BASED ON OUR 32NM PROCESS TECHNOLOGY.

MICROARCHITECTURE REFERS TO THE LAYOUT, DENSITY, AND LOGICAL

DESIGN OF A MICROPROCESSOR. OUR 2ND GENERATION INTEL CORE

PROCESSOR FAMILY INCORPORATES FEATURES DESIGNED TO INCREASE

PERFORMANCE AND ENERGY EFFICIENCY, SUCH AS.



INTEGRATED PROCESSOR GRAPHICS,

WHICH ALLOW FOR SHARED

RESOURCES ACROSS PROCESSING CORES AND GRAPHICS ARCHITECTURES TO

ENABLE OPTIMAL PERFORMANCE WHILE SAVING POWER;



INTEL

®

ADVANCED VECTOR EXTENSIONS

, WHICH ALLOW FOR FASTER AND

SIMPLER PERFORMANCE OF COMPUTATIONALLY INTENSIVE TASKS, SUCH AS

DIGITAL PHOTO EDITING, CREATION OF MUSIC, AND OTHER CONTENT

CREATION;



INTEL

®

TURBO BOOST TECHNOLOGY 2.0

, WHICH AUTOMATICALLY

INCREASES PROCESSOR FREQUENCY WHEN APPLICATIONS DEMAND HIGHER

PERFORMANCE; AND



INTEL

®

QUICK SYNC VIDEO,

WHICH ACCELERATES ENCODING,

DECODING, AND TRANSCODING FEATURES, SUCH AS CONVERSION OF MEDIA

FOR PORTABLE PLAYERS AND ONLINE VIDEO-SHARING SERVICES.

OUR 2ND GENERATION INTEL CORE PROCESSOR FAMILY INTEGRATES

GRAPHICS FUNCTIONALITY ONTO THE PROCESSOR DIE. IN CONTRAST, SOME

OF OUR PREVIOUS-GENERATION 32NM PROCESSORS HAVE INCORPORATED A

SEPARATE 45NM GRAPHICS CHIP INSIDE THE PROCESSOR PACKAGE. WE

ALSO OFFER GRAPHICS FUNCTIONALITY AS PART OF A SEPARATE CHIPSET

OUTSIDE THE PROCESSOR PACKAGE. PROCESSOR PACKAGES MAY ALSO

INTEGRATE THE MEMORY CONTROLLER.

IN ADDITION, WE OFFER AND ARE CONTINUING TO DEVELOP SYSTEM ON

CHIP (SOC) PRODUCTS THAT INTEGRATE OUR CORE PROCESSING

FUNCTIONALITIES WITH OTHER SYSTEM COMPONENTS, SUCH AS GRAPHICS,

AUDIO, AND VIDEO, ONTO A SINGLE CHIP TO FORM A PURPOSE-BUILT

SOLUTION. SOC PRODUCTS ARE DESIGNED TO REDUCE TOTAL COST OF

OWNERSHIP, AND PROVIDE IMPROVED PERFORMANCE DUE TO HIGHER

INTEGRATION, LOWER POWER CONSUMPTION, AND SMALLER FORM FACTORS.

CHIPSETS

A CHIPSET SENDS DATA BETWEEN THE MICROPROCESSOR AND INPUT,

DISPLAY, AND STORAGE DEVICES, SUCH AS THE KEYBOARD, MOUSE,

MONITOR, HARD DRIVE OR SOLID-STATE DRIVE, AND CD, DVD, OR

BLU-RAY* DRIVE. WE OFFER CHIPSETS DESIGNED FOR NOTEBOOKS,

NETBOOKS, DESKTOPS, SERVERS, WORKSTATIONS, STORAGE PRODUCTS,

EMBEDDED APPLICATIONS, COMMUNICATIONS PRODUCTS, CONSUMER

ELECTRONICS DEVICES, AND HANDHELD DEVICES. CHIPSETS EXTEND THE

AUDIO, VIDEO, AND OTHER CAPABILITIES OF MANY SYSTEMS AND PERFORM

ESSENTIAL LOGIC FUNCTIONS, SUCH AS BALANCING THE PERFORMANCE OF

THE SYSTEM AND REMOVING BOTTLENECKS. SOME CHIPSETS MAY ALSO

INCLUDE GRAPHICS FUNCTIONALITY OR BOTH GRAPHICS FUNCTIONALITY

AND A MEMORY CONTROLLER, FOR USE WITH OUR MICROPROCESSORS THAT

DO NOT INTEGRATE THOSE SYSTEM COMPONENTS.

MOTHERBOARDS

WE OFFER MOTHERBOARD PRODUCTS DESIGNED FOR OUR DESKTOP, SERVER,

AND WORKSTATION PLATFORMS. A MOTHERBOARD IS THE PRINCIPAL BOARD

WITHIN A SYSTEM, AND TYPICALLY CONTAINS THE MICROPROCESSOR,

CHIPSET, MEMORY, AND OTHER COMPONENTS. THE MOTHERBOARD ALSO HAS

CONNECTORS FOR ATTACHING DEVICES TO THE BUS, WHICH IS THE

SUBSYSTEM THAT TRANSFERS DATA AMONG VARIOUS COMPONENTS OF A

COMPUTER.

WIRELESS

AND WIRED CONNECTIVITY

WE OFFER WIRELESS AND WIRED CONNECTIVITY PRODUCTS, INCLUDING

NETWORK ADAPTERS AND EMBEDDED WIRELESS CARDS, BASED ON

INDUSTRY-STANDARD PROTOCOLS USED TO TRANSLATE AND TRANSMIT DATA

ACROSS NETWORKS. WIRELESS CONNECTIVITY PRODUCTS BASED ON WIFI

TECHNOLOGY ALLOW USERS TO WIRELESSLY CONNECT TO HIGH-SPEED LOCAL

AREA NETWORKS, TYPICALLY WITHIN A CLOSE RANGE. WE HAVE ALSO

DEVELOPED WIRELESS CONNECTIVITY PRODUCTS FOR BOTH MOBILE AND

FIXED NETWORKS BASED ON WIMAX, A STANDARDS-BASED WIRELESS

TECHNOLOGY PROVIDING HIGH-SPEED BROADBAND CONNECTIVITY THAT CAN

LINK USERS AND NETWORKS UP TO SEVERAL MILES APART.

MICROPROCESSOR

AND PLATFORM TECHNOLOGIES

WE OFFER FEATURES TO IMPROVE MICROPROCESSOR AND PLATFORM

CAPABILITIES THAT CAN ENHANCE SYSTEM PERFORMANCE AND THE USER

EXPERIENCE. FOR EXAMPLE, WE OFFER TECHNOLOGIES THAT CAN HELP

INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY MANAGERS MAINTAIN, MANAGE, AND PROTECT

ENABLED SYSTEMS THAT ARE PLUGGED INTO A POWER SOURCE AND

CONNECTED TO A NETWORK, EVEN IF A COMPUTER IS TURNED OFF OR HAS

A FAILED HARD DRIVE OR OPERATING SYSTEM. WE ALSO OFFER

TECHNOLOGIES THAT CAN ENABLE VIRTUALIZATION, IN WHICH A SINGLE

COMPUTER SYSTEM CAN FUNCTION AS MULTIPLE VIRTUAL SYSTEMS BY

RUNNING MULTIPLE OPERATING SYSTEMS AND APPLICATIONS.

VIRTUALIZATION CAN CONSOLIDATE WORKLOADS AND PROVIDE INCREASED

SECURITY AND MANAGEMENT CAPABILITIES. TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THESE

AND OTHER FEATURES THAT WE OFFER, A COMPUTER SYSTEM MUST HAVE A

MICROPROCESSOR THAT SUPPORTS A CHIPSET, BIOS (BASIC INPUT/OUTPUT

SYSTEM) THAT USES THE TECHNOLOGY, AND SOFTWARE THAT IS OPTIMIZED

FOR THE TECHNOLOGY. PERFORMANCE WILL VARY DEPENDING ON THE

SYSTEM HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE USED. WE ALSO OFFER TECHNOLOGY THAT

ENABLES EACH PROCESSOR CORE TO PROCESS TWO SOFTWARE TASKS OR

THREADS SIMULTANEOUSLY.

AS OF DECEMBER 25, 2010, THE MAJORITY OF OUR MICROPROCESSORS

WERE MANUFACTURED ON 300MM WAFERS USING OUR 32NM PROCESS

TECHNOLOGY. IN THE SECOND HALF OF 2011, WE EXPECT TO BEGIN

MANUFACTURING MICROPROCESSORS USING OUR 22NM PROCESS TECHNOLOGY.

AS WE MOVE TO EACH SUCCEEDING GENERATION OF MANUFACTURING

PROCESS TECHNOLOGY, WE INCUR SIGNIFICANT

START-UP

COSTS TO PREPARE EACH FACTORY FOR MANUFACTURING. HOWEVER,

CONTINUING TO ADVANCE OUR PROCESS TECHNOLOGY PROVIDES BENEFITS

THAT WE BELIEVE JUSTIFY THESE COSTS. THE BENEFITS OF MOVING TO

EACH SUCCEEDING GENERATION OF MANUFACTURING PROCESS TECHNOLOGY

CAN INCLUDE USING LESS SPACE PER TRANSISTOR, REDUCING HEAT

OUTPUT FROM EACH TRANSISTOR,

AND/OR

INCREASING THE NUMBER OF INTEGRATED FEATURES ON EACH CHIP. THESE

ADVANCEMENTS CAN RESULT IN MICROPROCESSORS THAT ARE HIGHER

PERFORMING, CONSUME LESS POWER,

AND/OR

COST

LESS TO MANUFACTURE.

WE USE THIRD-PARTY MANUFACTURING COMPANIES (FOUNDRIES) TO

MANUFACTURE WAFERS FOR CERTAIN COMPONENTS, INCLUDING NETWORKING

AND COMMUNICATIONS PRODUCTS. IN ADDITION, WE PRIMARILY USE

SUBCONTRACTORS TO MANUFACTURE BOARD-LEVEL PRODUCTS AND SYSTEMS,

AND PURCHASE CERTAIN COMMUNICATIONS NETWORKING PRODUCTS FROM

EXTERNAL VENDORS IN THE ASIA-PACIFIC REGION.

FOLLOWING THE MANUFACTURING PROCESS, THE MAJORITY OF OUR

COMPONENTS ARE SUBJECT TO ASSEMBLY AND TEST. WE PERFORM OUR

COMPONENTS ASSEMBLY AND TEST AT FACILITIES IN MALAYSIA, CHINA,

COSTA RICA, AND VIETNAM. OUR VIETNAM FACILITY BEGAN PRODUCTION

IN THE FIRST HALF OF 2010. TO AUGMENT CAPACITY, WE USE

SUBCONTRACTORS TO PERFORM ASSEMBLY OF CERTAIN PRODUCTS,

PRIMARILY CHIPSETS AND NETWORKING AND COMMUNICATIONS PRODUCTS.

OUR NAND FLASH MEMORY PRODUCTS ARE MANUFACTURED BY IMFT, A NAND

FLASH MEMORY MANUFACTURING COMPANY THAT WE FORMED WITH MICRON

TECHNOLOGY, INC. OUR NAND FLASH MEMORY PRODUCTS ARE MANUFACTURED

BY IMFT USING 25NM, 34NM, OR 50NM PROCESS TECHNOLOGY. AS OF

DECEMBER 25, 2010, WE WERE COMMITTED TO PURCHASE 49% OF THE

MANUFACTURED OUTPUT OF IMFT. ASSEMBLY AND TEST OF NAND FLASH

MEMORY PRODUCTS IS PERFORMED BY MICRON AND OTHER EXTERNAL

SUBCONTRACTORS. SEE NOTE 11: EQUITY METHOD AND COST METHOD

INVESTMENTS IN PART II, ITEM 8 OF THIS FORM

OUR EMPLOYMENT PRACTICES ARE CONSISTENT WITH, AND WE EXPECT OUR

SUPPLIERS AND SUBCONTRACTORS TO ABIDE BY, LOCAL COUNTRY LAW. IN

ADDITION, WE IMPOSE A MINIMUM EMPLOYEE AGE REQUIREMENT AS WELL

AS PROGRESSIVE EHS REQUIREMENTS, REGARDLESS OF LOCAL LAW.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

WE HAVE THOUSANDS OF SUPPLIERS, INCLUDING SUBCONTRACTORS,

PROVIDING OUR VARIOUS MATERIALS AND SERVICE NEEDS. WE SET

EXPECTATIONS FOR SUPPLIER PERFORMANCE AND REINFORCE THOSE

EXPECTATIONS WITH PERIODIC ASSESSMENTS. WE COMMUNICATE THOSE

EXPECTATIONS TO OUR SUPPLIERS REGULARLY AND WORK WITH THEM TO

IMPLEMENT IMPROVEMENTS WHEN NECESSARY. WE SEEK, WHERE POSSIBLE,

TO HAVE SEVERAL SOURCES OF SUPPLY FOR ALL OF THESE MATERIALS AND

RESOURCES, BUT WE MAY RELY ON A SINGLE OR LIMITED NUMBER OF

SUPPLIERS, OR UPON SUPPLIERS IN A SINGLE COUNTRY. IN THOSE

CASES, WE DEVELOP AND IMPLEMENT PLANS AND ACTIONS TO REDUCE THE

EXPOSURE THAT WOULD RESULT FROM A DISRUPTION IN SUPPLY. WE HAVE

ENTERED INTO LONG-TERM CONTRACTS WITH CERTAIN SUPPLIERS TO

ENSURE A PORTION OF OUR SILICON SUPPLY.

OUR PRODUCTS ARE TYPICALLY PRODUCED AT MULTIPLE INTEL FACILITIES

AT VARIOUS SITES AROUND THE WORLD, OR BY SUBCONTRACTORS WHO HAVE

MULTIPLE FACILITIES. HOWEVER, SOME PRODUCTS ARE PRODUCED IN ONLY

ONE INTEL OR SUBCONTRACTOR FACILITY, AND WE SEEK TO IMPLEMENT

ACTION PLANS TO REDUCE THE EXPOSURE THAT WOULD RESULT FROM A

DISRUPTION AT ANY SUCH FACILITY. SEE RISK FACTORS IN

PART I, ITEM 1A OF THIS FORM

RESEARCH

AND DEVELOPMENT

WE ARE COMMITTED TO INVESTING IN WORLD-CLASS TECHNOLOGY

DEVELOPMENT, PARTICULARLY IN THE DESIGN AND MANUFACTURE OF

INTEGRATED CIRCUITS. RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT (R&D)

EXPENDITURES IN 2010 WERE $6.6 BILLION ($5.7 BILLION IN 2009 AND

2008).

OUR R&D ACTIVITIES ARE DIRECTED TOWARD DEVELOPING THE

TECHNOLOGY INNOVATIONS THAT WE BELIEVE WILL DELIVER OUR NEXT

GENERATION OF PRODUCTS AND PLATFORMS, WHICH WILL IN TURN ENABLE

NEW FORM FACTORS AND USAGE MODELS FOR BUSINESSES AND CONSUMERS.

OUR R&D ACTIVITIES RANGE FROM DESIGNING AND DEVELOPING NEW

PRODUCTS AND MANUFACTURING PROCESSES TO RESEARCHING FUTURE

TECHNOLOGIES AND PRODUCTS.

WE ARE FOCUSING OUR R&D EFFORTS ON ADVANCED COMPUTING

TECHNOLOGIES, DEVELOPING NEW MICROARCHITECTURES, ADVANCING OUR

SILICON MANUFACTURING PROCESS TECHNOLOGY, DELIVERING THE NEXT

GENERATION OF MICROPROCESSORS AND CHIPSETS, IMPROVING OUR

PLATFORM INITIATIVES, AND DEVELOPING SOFTWARE SOLUTIONS AND

TOOLS TO SUPPORT OUR TECHNOLOGIES. OUR R&D EFFORTS ENABLE

NEW LEVELS OF PERFORMANCE AND ADDRESS AREAS SUCH AS ENERGY

EFFICIENCY, SECURITY, SCALABILITY FOR MULTI-CORE ARCHITECTURES,

SYSTEM MANAGEABILITY, AND EASE OF USE. WE CONTINUE TO MAKE

SIGNIFICANT R&D INVESTMENTS IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF SOCS TO

ENABLE GROWTH IN AREAS SUCH AS HANDHELD DEVICES, EMBEDDED

APPLICATIONS, AND CONSUMER ELECTRONICS. IN ADDITION, WE CONTINUE

TO MAKE SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS IN WIRELESS TECHNOLOGIES,

GRAPHICS, AND HIGH-PERFORMANCE COMPUTING.

AS PART OF OUR R&D EFFORTS, WE PLAN TO INTRODUCE A NEW

MICROARCHITECTURE FOR OUR NOTEBOOK, DESKTOP, AND INTEL XEON

PROCESSORS APPROXIMATELY EVERY TWO YEARS AND RAMP THE NEXT

GENERATION OF SILICON PROCESS TECHNOLOGY IN THE INTERVENING

YEARS. WE REFER TO THIS AS OUR TICK-TOCK TECHNOLOGY

DEVELOPMENT CADENCE. IN 2010, WE INTRODUCED OUR 2ND GENERATION

INTEL CORE MICROARCHITECTURE, A NEW MICROARCHITECTURE USING OUR

EXISTING 32NM PROCESS TECHNOLOGY. WE ARE CURRENTLY DEVELOPING

22NM PROCESS TECHNOLOGY, OUR NEXT-GENERATION PROCESS TECHNOLOGY,

AND EXPECT TO BEGIN MANUFACTURING PRODUCTS USING THAT TECHNOLOGY

IN THE SECOND HALF OF 2011. OUR LEADERSHIP IN SILICON TECHNOLOGY

HAS ENABLED US TO MAKE MOORES LAW A REALITY.

MOORES LAW PREDICTED THAT TRANSISTOR DENSITY ON INTEGRATED

CIRCUITS WOULD DOUBLE ABOUT EVERY TWO YEARS. OUR LEADERSHIP IN

SILICON TECHNOLOGY HAS ALSO HELPED EXPAND ON THE ADVANCES

ANTICIPATED BY MOORES LAW BY BRINGING NEW CAPABILITIES

INTO SILICON AND PRODUCING NEW PRODUCTS AND PLATFORMS OPTIMIZED

FOR A WIDER VARIETY OF APPLICATIONS.

OUR R&D MODEL IS BASED ON A GLOBAL ORGANIZATION THAT

EMPHASIZES A COLLABORATIVE APPROACH TO IDENTIFYING AND

DEVELOPING NEW TECHNOLOGIES, LEADING STANDARDS INITIATIVES, AND

INFLUENCING REGULATORY POLICIES TO ACCELERATE THE ADOPTION OF

NEW TECHNOLOGIES. OUR R&D INITIATIVES ARE PERFORMED BY

VARIOUS INTERNAL BUSINESS GROUPS, AND WE CENTRALLY MANAGE KEY

CROSS-BUSINESS GROUP PRODUCT INITIATIVES TO ALIGN AND PRIORITIZE

OUR R&D ACTIVITIES ACROSS THESE GROUPS. IN ADDITION, WE MAY

AUGMENT OUR R&D INITIATIVES BY INVESTING IN COMPANIES OR

ENTERING INTO AGREEMENTS WITH COMPANIES THAT HAVE SIMILAR

R&D FOCUS AREAS. FOR EXAMPLE, WE HAVE AN AGREEMENT WITH

MICRON FOR JOINT DEVELOPMENT OF NAND FLASH MEMORY TECHNOLOGIES.

EMPLOYEES

AS OF DECEMBER 25, 2010, WE HAD 82,500 EMPLOYEES WORLDWIDE, WITH

APPROXIMATELY 55% OF THOSE EMPLOYEES LOCATED IN THE U.S.

SALES AND

MARKETING

CUSTOMERS

WE SELL OUR PRODUCTS PRIMARILY TO ORIGINAL EQUIPMENT

MANUFACTURERS (OEMS) AND ORIGINAL DESIGN MANUFACTURERS (ODMS).

ODMS PROVIDE DESIGN

AND/OR

MANUFACTURING SERVICES TO BRANDED AND UNBRANDED PRIVATE-LABEL

RESELLERS. IN ADDITION, WE SELL OUR PRODUCTS TO OTHER

MANUFACTURERS, INCLUDING MAKERS OF A WIDE RANGE OF INDUSTRIAL

AND COMMUNICATIONS EQUIPMENT. OUR CUSTOMERS ALSO INCLUDE THOSE

WHO BUY PC COMPONENTS AND OUR OTHER PRODUCTS THROUGH

DISTRIBUTOR, RESELLER, RETAIL, AND OEM CHANNELS THROUGHOUT THE

WORLD.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

OUR WORLDWIDE RESELLER SALES CHANNEL CONSISTS OF THOUSANDS OF

INDIRECT CUSTOMERSSYSTEMS BUILDERS THAT PURCHASE INTEL

MICROPROCESSORS AND OTHER PRODUCTS FROM OUR DISTRIBUTORS. WE

HAVE A BOXED PROCESSOR PROGRAM THAT ALLOWS DISTRIBUTORS TO SELL

INTEL MICROPROCESSORS IN SMALL QUANTITIES TO THESE

SYSTEMS-BUILDER CUSTOMERS; BOXED PROCESSORS ARE ALSO AVAILABLE

IN DIRECT RETAIL OUTLETS.

IN 2010, HEWLETT-PACKARD COMPANY ACCOUNTED FOR 21% OF OUR NET

REVENUE (21% IN 2009 AND 20% IN 2008) AND DELL INC. ACCOUNTED

FOR 17% OF OUR NET REVENUE (17% IN 2009 AND 18% IN 2008). NO

SALES

ARRANGEMENTS

OUR PRODUCTS ARE SOLD THROUGH SALES OFFICES THROUGHOUT THE

WORLD. SALES OF OUR PRODUCTS ARE TYPICALLY MADE VIA PURCHASE

ORDER ACKNOWLEDGMENTS THAT CONTAIN STANDARD TERMS AND CONDITIONS

COVERING MATTERS SUCH AS PRICING, PAYMENT TERMS, AND WARRANTIES,

AS WELL AS INDEMNITIES FOR ISSUES SPECIFIC TO OUR PRODUCTS, SUCH

AS PATENT AND COPYRIGHT INDEMNITIES. FROM TIME TO TIME, WE MAY

ENTER INTO ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS WITH CUSTOMERS COVERING, FOR

EXAMPLE, CHANGES FROM OUR STANDARD TERMS AND CONDITIONS, NEW

PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT AND MARKETING, PRIVATE-LABEL BRANDING, AND

OTHER MATTERS. MOST OF OUR SALES ARE MADE USING ELECTRONIC AND

WEB-BASED PROCESSES THAT ALLOW THE CUSTOMER TO REVIEW INVENTORY

AVAILABILITY AND TRACK THE PROGRESS OF SPECIFIC GOODS ORDERED.

PRICING ON PARTICULAR PRODUCTS MAY VARY BASED ON VOLUMES ORDERED

AND OTHER FACTORS. WE ALSO OFFER DISCOUNTS, REBATES, AND OTHER

INCENTIVES TO CUSTOMERS TO INCREASE ACCEPTANCE OF OUR PRODUCTS

AND TECHNOLOGY.

OUR PRODUCTS ARE TYPICALLY SHIPPED UNDER TERMS THAT TRANSFER

TITLE TO THE CUSTOMER, EVEN IN ARRANGEMENTS FOR WHICH THE

RECOGNITION OF REVENUE AND RELATED COSTS OF SALES IS DEFERRED.

OUR STANDARD TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF SALE TYPICALLY PROVIDE THAT

PAYMENT IS DUE AT A LATER DATE, GENERALLY 30 DAYS AFTER SHIPMENT

OR DELIVERY. OUR CREDIT DEPARTMENT SETS ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND

SHIPPING LIMITS FOR INDIVIDUAL CUSTOMERS TO CONTROL CREDIT RISK

TO INTEL ARISING FROM OUTSTANDING ACCOUNT BALANCES. WE ASSESS

CREDIT RISK THROUGH QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE ANALYSIS, AND

FROM THIS ANALYSIS, WE ESTABLISH CREDIT LIMITS AND DETERMINE

WHETHER WE WILL SEEK TO USE ONE OR MORE CREDIT SUPPORT DEVICES,

SUCH AS OBTAINING SOME FORM OF THIRD-PARTY GUARANTEE OR STANDBY

LETTER OF CREDIT, OR OBTAINING CREDIT INSURANCE FOR ALL OR A

PORTION OF THE ACCOUNT BALANCE IF NECESSARY. CREDIT LOSSES MAY

STILL BE INCURRED DUE TO BANKRUPTCY, FRAUD, OR OTHER FAILURE OF

THE CUSTOMER TO PAY. FOR INFORMATION ABOUT OUR ALLOWANCE FOR

DOUBTFUL RECEIVABLES, SEE SCHEDULE IIVALUATION AND

QUALIFYING ACCOUNTS IN PART IV OF THIS FORM

10-K.

MOST OF OUR SALES TO DISTRIBUTORS ARE MADE UNDER AGREEMENTS

ALLOWING FOR PRICE PROTECTION ON UNSOLD MERCHANDISE AND A RIGHT

OF RETURN ON STIPULATED QUANTITIES OF UNSOLD MERCHANDISE. UNDER

THE PRICE PROTECTION PROGRAM, WE GIVE DISTRIBUTORS CREDITS FOR

THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE ORIGINAL PRICE PAID AND THE CURRENT

PRICE THAT WE OFFER. ON MOST PRODUCTS, THERE IS NO CONTRACTUAL

LIMIT ON THE AMOUNT OF PRICE PROTECTION, NOR IS THERE A LIMIT ON

THE TIME HORIZON UNDER WHICH PRICE PROTECTION IS GRANTED. THE

RIGHT OF RETURN GRANTED GENERALLY CONSISTS OF A STOCK ROTATION

PROGRAM IN WHICH DISTRIBUTORS ARE ABLE TO EXCHANGE CERTAIN

PRODUCTS BASED ON THE NUMBER OF QUALIFIED PURCHASES MADE BY THE

DISTRIBUTOR. WE HAVE THE OPTION TO GRANT CREDIT FOR, REPAIR, OR

REPLACE DEFECTIVE PRODUCTS, AND THERE IS NO CONTRACTUAL LIMIT ON

THE AMOUNT OF CREDIT THAT MAY BE GRANTED TO A DISTRIBUTOR FOR

DEFECTIVE PRODUCTS.

DISTRIBUTION

DISTRIBUTORS TYPICALLY HANDLE A WIDE VARIETY OF PRODUCTS,

INCLUDING THOSE THAT COMPETE WITH OUR PRODUCTS, AND FILL ORDERS

FOR MANY CUSTOMERS. WE ALSO UTILIZE THIRD-PARTY SALES

REPRESENTATIVES WHO GENERALLY DO NOT OFFER DIRECTLY COMPETITIVE

PRODUCTS BUT MAY CARRY COMPLEMENTARY ITEMS MANUFACTURED BY

OTHERS. SALES REPRESENTATIVES DO NOT MAINTAIN A PRODUCT

INVENTORY; INSTEAD, THEIR CUSTOMERS PLACE ORDERS DIRECTLY WITH

US OR THROUGH DISTRIBUTORS. WE HAVE SEVERAL DISTRIBUTION

WAREHOUSES THAT ARE LOCATED IN CLOSE PROXIMITY TO KEY CUSTOMERS.

BACKLOG

WE DO NOT BELIEVE THAT BACKLOG AS OF ANY PARTICULAR DATE IS

MEANINGFUL, AS OUR SALES ARE MADE PRIMARILY PURSUANT TO STANDARD

PURCHASE ORDERS FOR DELIVERY OF PRODUCTS. ONLY A SMALL PORTION

OF OUR ORDERS IS NON-CANCELABLE, AND THE DOLLAR AMOUNT

ASSOCIATED WITH THE NON-CANCELABLE PORTION IS NOT SIGNIFICANT.

SEASONAL

TRENDS

OUR MICROPROCESSOR SALES GENERALLY HAVE FOLLOWED A SEASONAL

TREND. HISTORICALLY, OUR SALES HAVE BEEN HIGHER IN THE SECOND

HALF OF THE YEAR THAN IN THE FIRST HALF OF THE YEAR,

ACCELERATING IN THE THIRD QUARTER AND PEAKING IN THE FOURTH

QUARTER. CONSUMER PURCHASES OF PCS HAVE HISTORICALLY BEEN HIGHER

IN THE SECOND HALF OF THE YEAR, PRIMARILY DUE TO

BACK-TO-SCHOOL

AND HOLIDAY DEMAND. IN ADDITION, PURCHASES FROM BUSINESSES HAVE

ALSO HISTORICALLY TENDED TO BE HIGHER IN THE SECOND HALF OF THE

YEAR.

THAT ACCRUES FUNDS BASED ON PURCHASES AND PARTIALLY REIMBURSES

THE OEMS FOR MARKETING ACTIVITIES FOR PRODUCTS FEATURING INTEL

BRANDS, SUBJECT TO THE OEMS MEETING DEFINED CRITERIA. THESE

MARKETING ACTIVITIES PRIMARILY INCLUDE TELEVISION, PRINT, AND

INTERNET MARKETING. WE HAVE ALSO ENTERED INTO JOINT MARKETING

ARRANGEMENTS WITH CERTAIN CUSTOMERS.

COMPETITION

THE SEMICONDUCTOR INDUSTRY IS DYNAMIC, CHARACTERIZED BY RAPID

ADVANCES IN TECHNOLOGY AND FREQUENT PRODUCT INTRODUCTIONS. AS

UNIT VOLUMES OF A PRODUCT GROW, PRODUCTION EXPERIENCE IS

ACCUMULATED AND COSTS TYPICALLY DECREASE, FURTHER COMPETITION

DEVELOPS, AND PRICES DECLINE. THE LIFE CYCLE OF OUR PRODUCTS IS

VERY SHORT, SOMETIMES LESS THAN A YEAR. THESE SHORT PRODUCT LIFE

CYCLES AND OTHER FACTORS LEAD TO FREQUENT NEGOTIATIONS WITH OUR

OEM CUSTOMERS, WHICH TYPICALLY ARE LARGE, SOPHISTICATED BUYERS

WHO ARE ALSO OPERATING IN VERY COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENTS. OUR

ABILITY TO COMPETE DEPENDS ON OUR ABILITY TO NAVIGATE THIS

ENVIRONMENT, BY IMPROVING OUR PRODUCTS AND PROCESSES FASTER THAN

OUR COMPETITORS, ANTICIPATING CHANGING CUSTOMER REQUIREMENTS,

DEVELOPING AND LAUNCHING NEW PRODUCTS AND PLATFORMS, PRICING OUR

PRODUCTS COMPETITIVELY, AND REDUCING AVERAGE UNIT COST. SEE

RISK FACTORS IN PART I, ITEM 1A OF THIS FORM

10-K.

OUR PRODUCTS COMPETE PRIMARILY BASED ON PERFORMANCE, ENERGY

EFFICIENCY, FEATURES, PRICE, QUALITY, RELIABILITY, BRAND

RECOGNITION, AND AVAILABILITY. WE ARE FOCUSED ON OFFERING

INNOVATIVE PRODUCTS AND WORLDWIDE SUPPORT FOR OUR CUSTOMERS AT

COMPETITIVE PRICES, INCLUDING PROVIDING IMPROVED

ENERGY-EFFICIENT PERFORMANCE, ENHANCED SECURITY, AND INTERNET

CONNECTIVITY. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR COMPUTING PLATFORMS, WHICH WE

DEFINE AS INTEGRATED HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE COMPUTING

TECHNOLOGIES THAT ARE DESIGNED TO PROVIDE AN OPTIMIZED SOLUTION,

PROVIDE US WITH A COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE COMPARED TO COMPONENTS

THAT ARE USED SEPARATELY.

WE BELIEVE THAT OUR NETWORK OF MANUFACTURING FACILITIES AND

ASSEMBLY AND TEST FACILITIES GIVES US A COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE.

THIS NETWORK ENABLES US TO HAVE MORE DIRECT CONTROL OVER OUR

PROCESSES, QUALITY CONTROL, PRODUCT COST, VOLUME, TIMING OF

PRODUCTION, AND OTHER FACTORS. THESE FACILITIES REQUIRE

SIGNIFICANT UP-FRONT CAPITAL SPENDING AND THEREFORE MAKE IT

DIFFICULT FOR US TO REDUCE OUR COSTS IN THE SHORT TERM. MANY OF

OUR COMPETITORS DO NOT OWN SUCH FACILITIES BECAUSE THEY MAY NOT

BE ABLE TO AFFORD TO DO SO OR BECAUSE THEIR BUSINESS MODELS

INVOLVE THE USE OF THIRD-PARTY FOUNDRIES AND ASSEMBLY AND TEST

SUBCONTRACTORS FOR MANUFACTURING AND ASSEMBLY AND TEST. THE

THIRD-PARTY FOUNDRIES AND SUBCONTRACTORS MAY ALSO OFFER

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, DESIGN SERVICES, AND OTHER GOODS AND

SERVICES TO OUR COMPETITORS. THESE FABLESS

SEMICONDUCTOR COMPANIES INCLUDE BROADCOM CORPORATION, NVIDIA

CORPORATION, QUALCOMM INCORPORATED, AND VIA TECHNOLOGIES, INC.

SOME OF OUR COMPETITORS, SUCH AS ADVANCED MICRO DEVICES, INC.

(AMD), OWN PORTIONS OF SUCH FACILITIES THROUGH INVESTMENT OR

JOINT-VENTURE ARRANGEMENTS WITH OTHER COMPANIES.

WE PLAN TO CONTINUE TO CULTIVATE NEW BUSINESSES AND WORK WITH

THE COMPUTING AND COMMUNICATIONS INDUSTRIES THROUGH STANDARDS

BODIES, TRADE ASSOCIATIONS, OEMS, ODMS, AND INDEPENDENT SOFTWARE

AND OPERATING SYSTEM VENDORS TO HELP ALIGN THE INDUSTRY TO OFFER

PRODUCTS THAT TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE LATEST MARKET TRENDS AND

USAGE MODELS. WE FREQUENTLY PARTICIPATE IN INDUSTRY INITIATIVES

DESIGNED TO DISCUSS AND AGREE UPON TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS AND

OTHER ASPECTS OF TECHNOLOGIES THAT COULD BE ADOPTED AS STANDARDS

BY STANDARDS-SETTING ORGANIZATIONS. OUR COMPETITORS MAY ALSO

PARTICIPATE IN THE SAME INITIATIVES AND SPECIFICATION

DEVELOPMENT. OUR PARTICIPATION DOES NOT ENSURE THAT ANY

STANDARDS OR SPECIFICATIONS ADOPTED BY THESE ORGANIZATIONS WILL

BE CONSISTENT WITH OUR PRODUCT PLANNING.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

MICROPROCESSORS

WE CONTINUE TO BE LARGELY DEPENDENT ON THE SUCCESS OF OUR

MICROPROCESSOR BUSINESS. OUR ABILITY TO COMPETE DEPENDS ON OUR

ABILITY TO DELIVER NEW MICROPROCESSOR PRODUCTS WITH INCREASED

PERFORMANCE CAPABILITIES AND IMPROVED ENERGY-EFFICIENT

PERFORMANCE AT COMPETITIVE PRICES. SOME OF OUR MICROPROCESSOR

COMPETITORS, SUCH AS AMD, MARKET SOFTWARE-COMPATIBLE PRODUCTS

THAT COMPETE WITH OUR PROCESSORS. WE ALSO FACE COMPETITION FROM

COMPANIES OFFERING RIVAL ARCHITECTURE DESIGNS, SUCH AS CELL

BROADBAND ENGINE ARCHITECTURE DEVELOPED JOINTLY BY INTERNATIONAL

BUSINESS MACHINES CORPORATION (IBM), SONY CORPORATION, AND

TOSHIBA CORPORATION; POWER ARCHITECTURE* OFFERED BY IBM; ARM*

ARCHITECTURE DEVELOPED BY ARM LIMITED; AND SUN SCALABLE

PROCESSOR ARCHITECTURE (SPARC*) OFFERED BY ORACLE CORPORATION.

IN ADDITION, NVIDIA HAS BEGUN DEVELOPING CPUS BASED ON THE ARM

ARCHITECTURE TO COMBINE WITH ITS GRAPHICS PROCESSORS AND HAS

SHIFTED SOME OF THE WORKLOAD TRADITIONALLY PERFORMED BY THE

MICROPROCESSOR TO ITS GRAPHICS PROCESSOR.

AMD HAS BEEN OUR PRIMARY COMPETITOR IN THE MARKET SEGMENTS FOR

MICROPROCESSORS USED IN NOTEBOOKS, DESKTOPS, AND SERVERS, WHILE

COMPANIES USING ARM-BASED DESIGNS ARE OUR PRIMARY COMPETITORS IN

THE GROWING MARKET SEGMENTS FOR MICROPROCESSORS USED IN HANDHELD

DEVICES AND TABLETS. COMPANIES USING ARM-BASED DESIGNS ARE ALSO

TARGETING THE NOTEBOOK, NETBOOK, AND SERVER MARKET SEGMENTS. ARM

DOES NOT MANUFACTURE MICROPROCESSORS; THEY DESIGN AND LICENSE

SEMICONDUCTOR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND OFFER SUPPORTING

SOFTWARE AND SERVICES. OUR ABILITY TO COMPETE WITH ARM-BASED

COMPETITORS DEPENDS ON OUR ABILITY TO DESIGN AND PRODUCE

HIGH-PERFORMANCE, ENERGY-EFFICIENT MICROPROCESSORS AT

COMPETITIVE PRICES. IT ALSO REQUIRES US TO DEVELOP A SOFTWARE

ECOSYSTEM THAT APPEALS TO END USERS AND SOFTWARE DEVELOPERS. WE

HAVE TAKEN A NUMBER OF STEPS TO BUILD THIS SOFTWARE ECOSYSTEM,

INCLUDING THE DEVELOPMENT OF MEEGO*, A LINUX-BASED SOFTWARE

PLATFORM THAT WILL RUN ON MULTIPLE HARDWARE PLATFORMS; ACQUIRING

MCAFEE, INC., WHICH WE EXPECT TO COMPLETE IN THE FIRST QUARTER

ACQUISITIONS

AND STRATEGIC INVESTMENTS

WE EXPECT TO COMPLETE THE ACQUISITION OF MCAFEE IN THE FIRST

QUARTER OF 2011. MCAFEE IS A PROVIDER OF SECURITY PRODUCTS AND

SERVICES THAT HELP SECURE SYSTEMS AND NETWORKS. AS A RESULT OF

THE ACQUISITION, WE EXPECT TO HIRE APPROXIMATELY 6,400 MCAFEE

EMPLOYEES. MCAFEES OFFERINGS WILL INCLUDE ENDPOINT

SECURITY PRODUCTS, SYSTEM SECURITY PRODUCTS, CONSUMER SECURITY

PRODUCTS, NETWORK SECURITY PRODUCTS, AND RISK AND COMPLIANCE

PRODUCTS. MANY OF MCAFEES PRODUCTS ARE OFFERED UNDER A

SOFTWARE-AS-A-SERVICE DELIVERY MODEL, AN ONLINE CONSOLE USED TO

MANAGE AND UPDATE HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE, WHICH REDUCES

ON-PREMISE CAPITAL EXPENSES. THE ANTICIPATED ACQUISITION OF

MCAFEE REFLECTS OUR BELIEF THAT SECURITY IS A FUNDAMENTAL

COMPONENT OF ONLINE COMPUTING. AS WE DEVELOP FUTURE PRODUCTS AND

SERVICES, SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS WILL BE AS IMPORTANT AS OUR

CONTINUED FOCUS ON ENERGY-EFFICIENT PERFORMANCE AND INTERNET

CONNECTIVITY.

IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2011, WE COMPLETED THE ACQUISITION OF

THE WLS BUSINESS OF INFINEON. AS A RESULT OF THE ACQUISITION, WE

EXPECT TO HIRE APPROXIMATELY 3,700 EMPLOYEES FROM INFINEON. THE

WLS BUSINESS WILL OPERATE AS INTEL MOBILE COMMUNICATIONS AND

OFFER MOBILE PHONE COMPONENTS SUCH AS BASEBAND PROCESSORS, RADIO

FREQUENCY TRANSCEIVERS, AND POWER MANAGEMENT CHIPS. IN ADDITION

TO MANAGING THE EXISTING WLS BUSINESS, THE OBJECTIVE OF THE

ACQUISITION IS TO CONTRIBUTE TO OUR STRATEGY TO PROVIDE

SOLUTIONS WITH INTERNET CONNECTIVITY TO A BROAD RANGE OF

COMPUTING DEVICES.

DURING 2009, WE COMPLETED THE ACQUISITION OF WIND RIVER SYSTEMS,

A VENDOR OF SOFTWARE FOR EMBEDDED DEVICES. THE OBJECTIVE OF THE

ACQUISITION OF WIND RIVER SYSTEMS WAS TO ENABLE THE INTRODUCTION

OF PRODUCTS FOR THE EMBEDDED AND HANDHELD MARKET SEGMENTS,

RESULTING IN BENEFITS FOR OUR EXISTING OPERATIONS.

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS THAT APPLY TO OUR PRODUCTS AND

SERVICES INCLUDE PATENTS, COPYRIGHTS, TRADE SECRETS, TRADEMARKS,

AND MASKWORK RIGHTS. WE MAINTAIN A PROGRAM TO PROTECT OUR

INVESTMENT IN TECHNOLOGY BY ATTEMPTING TO ENSURE RESPECT FOR OUR

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS. THE EXTENT OF THE LEGAL PROTECTION

GIVEN TO DIFFERENT TYPES OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS VARIES

UNDER DIFFERENT COUNTRIES LEGAL SYSTEMS. WE INTEND TO

WE HAVE FILED AND OBTAINED A NUMBER OF PATENTS IN THE U.S. AND

OTHER COUNTRIES. WHILE OUR PATENTS ARE AN IMPORTANT ELEMENT OF

OUR SUCCESS, OUR BUSINESS AS A WHOLE IS NOT SIGNIFICANTLY

DEPENDENT ON ANY ONE PATENT. BECAUSE OF THE FAST PACE OF

INNOVATION AND PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT, OUR PRODUCTS ARE OFTEN

OBSOLETE BEFORE THE PATENTS RELATED TO THEM EXPIRE, AND

SOMETIMES ARE OBSOLETE BEFORE THE PATENTS RELATED TO THEM ARE

EVEN GRANTED. AS WE EXPAND OUR PRODUCT OFFERINGS INTO NEW

INDUSTRIES, WE ALSO SEEK TO EXTEND OUR PATENT DEVELOPMENT

EFFORTS TO PATENT SUCH PRODUCT OFFERINGS. ESTABLISHED

COMPETITORS IN EXISTING AND NEW INDUSTRIES, AS WELL AS COMPANIES

THAT PURCHASE AND ENFORCE PATENTS AND OTHER INTELLECTUAL

PROPERTY, MAY ALREADY HAVE PATENTS COVERING SIMILAR PRODUCTS.

THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO OBTAIN PATENTS

COVERING OUR OWN PRODUCTS, OR THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO OBTAIN

LICENSES FROM SUCH COMPANIES ON FAVORABLE TERMS OR AT ALL.

THE MAJORITY OF THE SOFTWARE THAT WE DISTRIBUTE, INCLUDING

SOFTWARE EMBEDDED IN OUR COMPONENT-LEVEL AND SYSTEM-LEVEL

PRODUCTS, IS ENTITLED TO COPYRIGHT PROTECTION. TO DISTINGUISH

INTEL PRODUCTS FROM OUR COMPETITORS PRODUCTS, WE HAVE

OBTAINED CERTAIN TRADEMARKS AND TRADE NAMES FOR OUR PRODUCTS,

AND WE MAINTAIN COOPERATIVE ADVERTISING PROGRAMS WITH CERTAIN

CUSTOMERS TO PROMOTE OUR BRANDS AND TO IDENTIFY PRODUCTS

CONTAINING GENUINE INTEL COMPONENTS. WE ALSO PROTECT CERTAIN

DETAILS ABOUT OUR PROCESSES, PRODUCTS, AND STRATEGIES AS TRADE

SECRETS, KEEPING CONFIDENTIAL THE INFORMATION THAT WE BELIEVE

PROVIDES US WITH A COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE.

COMPLIANCE

WITH ENVIRONMENTAL, HEALTH, AND SAFETY REGULATIONS

OUR COMPLIANCE EFFORTS FOCUS ON MONITORING REGULATORY AND

RESOURCE TRENDS AND SETTING COMPANY-WIDE PERFORMANCE TARGETS FOR

KEY RESOURCES AND EMISSIONS. THESE TARGETS ADDRESS SEVERAL

PARAMETERS, INCLUDING PRODUCT DESIGN; CHEMICAL, ENERGY, AND

WATER USE; CLIMATE CHANGE; WASTE RECYCLING; AND EMISSIONS.

INTEL FOCUSES ON REDUCING NATURAL RESOURCE USE, THE SOLID AND

CHEMICAL WASTE BY-PRODUCTS OF OUR MANUFACTURING PROCESSES, AND

THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT OF OUR PRODUCTS. WE CURRENTLY USE A

VARIETY OF MATERIALS IN OUR MANUFACTURING PROCESS THAT HAVE THE

POTENTIAL TO ADVERSELY IMPACT THE ENVIRONMENT AND ARE SUBJECT TO

A VARIETY OF EHS LAWS AND REGULATIONS. OVER THE PAST SEVERAL

YEARS, WE HAVE SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED THE USE OF LEAD AND

HALOGENATED FLAME RETARDANTS IN OUR PRODUCTS AND MANUFACTURING

PROCESSES.

E-WASTE

(WHICH INCLUDES ELECTRONIC PRODUCTS NEARING THE END OF THEIR

USEFUL LIVES) AND PROMOTE RECYCLING. THE EUROPEAN UNION REQUIRES

PRODUCERS OF CERTAIN ELECTRICAL AND ELECTRONIC EQUIPMENT TO

DEVELOP PROGRAMS THAT ALLOW CONSUMERS TO RETURN PRODUCTS FOR

RECYCLING. MANY STATES IN THE U.S. HAVE SIMILAR

E-WASTE

TAKE-BACK LAWS. ALTHOUGH THESE LAWS ARE TYPICALLY TARGETED AT

THE END ELECTRONIC PRODUCT AND NOT THE COMPONENT PRODUCTS THAT

INTEL MANUFACTURES, THE INCONSISTENCY OF MANY

E-WASTE

TAKE-BACK LAWS AND THE LACK OF LOCAL

MANAGEMENT OPTIONS IN MANY AREAS POSE A CHALLENGE FOR OUR

COMPLIANCE EFFORTS.

INTEL SEEKS TO REDUCE OUR GLOBAL GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS BY

INVESTING IN ENERGY CONSERVATION PROJECTS IN OUR FACTORIES AND

WORKING WITH SUPPLIERS TO IMPROVE ENERGY EFFICIENCY. WE TAKE A

HOLISTIC APPROACH TO POWER MANAGEMENT, ADDRESSING THE CHALLENGE

AT THE SILICON, PACKAGE, CIRCUIT, MICRO/MACRO ARCHITECTURE,

PLATFORM, AND SOFTWARE LEVELS. WE RECOGNIZE THAT CLIMATE CHANGE

MAY CAUSE GENERAL ECONOMIC RISK. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ON THE

RISKS OF CLIMATE CHANGE, SEE RISK FACTORS IN PART I,

WE SEE

THE POTENTIAL FOR HIGHER ENERGY COSTS DRIVEN BY CLIMATE CHANGE

REGULATIONS. THIS COULD INCLUDE ITEMS APPLIED TO UTILITIES THAT

ARE PASSED ALONG TO CUSTOMERS, SUCH AS CARBON TAXES OR COSTS

ASSOCIATED WITH OBTAINING PERMITS FOR OUR U.S. MANUFACTURING

OPERATIONS, EMISSION CAP AND TRADE PROGRAMS, OR RENEWABLE

PORTFOLIO STANDARDS.

WE ARE COMMITTED TO SUSTAINABILITY AND TAKE A LEADERSHIP

POSITION IN PROMOTING VOLUNTARY ENVIRONMENTAL INITIATIVES AND

WORKING PROACTIVELY WITH GOVERNMENTS, ENVIRONMENTAL GROUPS, AND

INDUSTRY TO PROMOTE GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY. WE

BELIEVE THAT TECHNOLOGY WILL BE FUNDAMENTAL TO FINDING SOLUTIONS

TO THE WORLDS ENVIRONMENTAL CHALLENGES, AND WE ARE JOINING

FORCES WITH INDUSTRY, BUSINESS, AND GOVERNMENTS TO FIND AND

PROMOTE WAYS THAT TECHNOLOGY CAN BE USED AS A TOOL TO COMBAT

CLIMATE CHANGE.

WE HAVE BEEN PURCHASING WIND POWER AND OTHER FORMS OF RENEWABLE

ENERGY AT SOME OF OUR MAJOR SITES FOR SEVERAL YEARS. AT THE

BEGINNING OF 2008, WE ANNOUNCED PLANS TO PURCHASE RENEWABLE

ENERGY CERTIFICATES UNDER A MULTI-YEAR CONTRACT. THE PURCHASE

HAS PLACED INTEL AT THE TOP OF THE EPAS GREEN POWER

PARTNERSHIP FOR THE PAST THREE YEARS AND WAS INTENDED TO HELP

STIMULATE THE MARKET FOR GREEN POWER, LEADING TO ADDITIONAL

GENERATING CAPACITY AND, ULTIMATELY, LOWER COSTS.

RISK

FACTORS

FLUCTUATIONS

IN DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS MAY HARM OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS AND

ARE DIFFICULT TO FORECAST.

IF DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS FLUCTUATES, OUR REVENUE AND

PROFITABILITY COULD BE HARMED. IMPORTANT FACTORS THAT COULD

CAUSE DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS TO FLUCTUATE INCLUDE.



CHANGES IN BUSINESS AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, INCLUDING DOWNTURNS

IN THE SEMICONDUCTOR INDUSTRY

AND/OR

THE

OVERALL ECONOMY;



CHANGES IN CONSUMER CONFIDENCE CAUSED BY CHANGES IN MARKET

CONDITIONS, INCLUDING CHANGES IN THE CREDIT MARKET, EXPECTATIONS

FOR INFLATION, UNEMPLOYMENT LEVELS, AND ENERGY OR OTHER

COMMODITY PRICES;



CHANGES IN THE LEVEL OF CUSTOMERS COMPONENTS INVENTORIES;



COMPETITIVE PRESSURES, INCLUDING PRICING PRESSURES, FROM

COMPANIES THAT HAVE COMPETING PRODUCTS, CHIP ARCHITECTURES,

MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGIES, AND MARKETING PROGRAMS;



CHANGES IN CUSTOMER PRODUCT NEEDS;



STRATEGIC ACTIONS TAKEN BY OUR COMPETITORS; AND



MARKET ACCEPTANCE OF OUR PRODUCTS.

IF PRODUCT DEMAND DECREASES, OUR MANUFACTURING OR ASSEMBLY AND

TEST CAPACITY COULD BE UNDERUTILIZED, AND WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO

RECORD AN IMPAIRMENT ON OUR LONG-LIVED ASSETS, INCLUDING

FACILITIES AND EQUIPMENT AS WELL AS INTANGIBLE ASSETS, WHICH

WOULD INCREASE OUR EXPENSES. IN ADDITION, IF PRODUCT DEMAND

DECREASES OR WE FAIL TO FORECAST DEMAND ACCURATELY, WE COULD BE

REQUIRED TO WRITE OFF INVENTORY OR RECORD EXCESS CAPACITY

CHARGES, WHICH WOULD HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON OUR GROSS MARGIN.

FACTORY-PLANNING DECISIONS MAY SHORTEN THE USEFUL LIVES OF

LONG-LIVED ASSETS, INCLUDING FACILITIES AND EQUIPMENT, AND CAUSE

US TO ACCELERATE DEPRECIATION. IN THE LONG TERM, IF PRODUCT

DEMAND INCREASES, WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO ADD MANUFACTURING OR

ASSEMBLY AND TEST CAPACITY FAST ENOUGH TO MEET MARKET DEMAND.

THESE CHANGES IN DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS, AND CHANGES IN OUR

CUSTOMERS PRODUCT NEEDS, COULD HAVE A VARIETY OF NEGATIVE

EFFECTS ON OUR COMPETITIVE POSITION AND OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS,

AND, IN CERTAIN CASES, MAY REDUCE OUR REVENUE, INCREASE OUR

COSTS, LOWER OUR GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE, OR REQUIRE US TO

RECOGNIZE IMPAIRMENTS OF OUR ASSETS.

THE

SEMICONDUCTOR INDUSTRY AND OUR OPERATIONS ARE CHARACTERIZED BY A

HIGH PERCENTAGE OF COSTS THAT ARE FIXED OR DIFFICULT TO REDUCE

IN THE SHORT TERM, AND BY PRODUCT DEMAND THAT IS HIGHLY VARIABLE

AND SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT DOWNTURNS THAT MAY HARM OUR BUSINESS,

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

THE SEMICONDUCTOR INDUSTRY AND OUR OPERATIONS ARE CHARACTERIZED

BY HIGH COSTS, SUCH AS THOSE RELATED TO FACILITY CONSTRUCTION

AND EQUIPMENT, R&D, AND EMPLOYMENT AND TRAINING OF A HIGHLY

SKILLED WORKFORCE, THAT ARE EITHER FIXED OR DIFFICULT TO REDUCE

IN THE SHORT TERM. AT THE SAME TIME, DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS IS

HIGHLY VARIABLE AND THERE HAVE BEEN DOWNTURNS, OFTEN IN

CONNECTION WITH MATURING PRODUCT CYCLES AND GENERAL ECONOMIC

MARKET CONDITIONS. THESE DOWNTURNS HAVE BEEN CHARACTERIZED BY

REDUCED PRODUCT DEMAND, MANUFACTURING OVERCAPACITY AND RESULTING

EXCESS CAPACITY CHARGES, HIGH INVENTORY LEVELS, AND LOWER

AVERAGE SELLING PRICES. THE COMBINATION OF THESE FACTORS MAY

CAUSE OUR REVENUE, GROSS MARGIN, CASH FLOW, AND PROFITABILITY TO

VARY SIGNIFICANTLY IN BOTH THE SHORT AND LONG TERM.

WE

OPERATE IN INTENSELY COMPETITIVE INDUSTRIES, AND OUR FAILURE TO

RESPOND QUICKLY TO TECHNOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENTS AND INCORPORATE

NEW FEATURES INTO OUR PRODUCTS COULD HARM OUR ABILITY TO

COMPETE.

WE OPERATE IN INTENSELY COMPETITIVE INDUSTRIES THAT EXPERIENCE

RAPID TECHNOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENTS, CHANGES IN INDUSTRY STANDARDS,

CHANGES IN CUSTOMER REQUIREMENTS, AND FREQUENT NEW PRODUCT

INTRODUCTIONS AND IMPROVEMENTS. IF WE ARE UNABLE TO RESPOND

QUICKLY AND SUCCESSFULLY TO THESE DEVELOPMENTS, WE MAY LOSE OUR

COMPETITIVE POSITION, AND OUR PRODUCTS OR TECHNOLOGIES MAY

BECOME UNCOMPETITIVE OR OBSOLETE. AS NEW COMPUTING MARKET

SEGMENTS EMERGE, SUCH AS NETBOOKS, HANDHELDS, TABLETS, AND

CONSUMER ELECTRONICS DEVICES, WE FACE NEW SOURCES OF

COMPETITION, AND CUSTOMERS THAT HAVE DIFFERENT REQUIREMENTS THAN

CUSTOMERS IN OUR TRADITIONAL PC BUSINESS. TO BE SUCCESSFUL, WE

NEED TO CULTIVATE NEW INDUSTRY RELATIONSHIPS IN THESE MARKET

SEGMENTS. AS THE NUMBER AND VARIETY OF INTERNET-CONNECTED

DEVICES INCREASE, WE NEED TO IMPROVE THE COST, ENERGY

EFFICIENCY, AND SECURITY FUNCTIONALITY OF OUR MICROPROCESSORS TO

SUCCEED IN THESE NEW MARKET SEGMENTS. IN ADDITION, WE NEED TO

FOCUS ON THE ACQUISITION AND DEVELOPMENT OF OUR SOFTWARE

CAPABILITIES IN ORDER TO PROVIDE CUSTOMERS WITH COMPLETE

COMPUTING SOLUTIONS.

TO COMPETE SUCCESSFULLY, WE MUST MAINTAIN A SUCCESSFUL R&D

EFFORT, DEVELOP NEW PRODUCTS AND PRODUCTION PROCESSES, AND

IMPROVE OUR EXISTING PRODUCTS AND PROCESSES AT THE SAME PACE OR

AHEAD OF OUR COMPETITORS. OUR R&D EFFORTS ARE AIMED AT

SOLVING INCREASINGLY COMPLEX PROBLEMS, AND WE DO NOT EXPECT THAT

ALL OF OUR PROJECTS WILL BE SUCCESSFUL. IF OUR R&D EFFORTS

ARE UNSUCCESSFUL, OUR FUTURE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COULD BE

MATERIALLY HARMED. WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO DEVELOP AND MARKET

THESE NEW PRODUCTS SUCCESSFULLY, THE PRODUCTS WE INVEST IN AND

DEVELOP MAY NOT BE WELL RECEIVED BY CUSTOMERS, AND PRODUCTS

DEVELOPED AND NEW TECHNOLOGIES OFFERED BY OTHERS MAY AFFECT

DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS. THESE TYPES OF EVENTS COULD HAVE A

VARIETY OF NEGATIVE EFFECTS ON OUR COMPETITIVE POSITION AND OUR

FINANCIAL RESULTS, SUCH AS REDUCING OUR REVENUE, INCREASING OUR

COSTS, LOWERING OUR GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE, AND REQUIRING US TO

RECOGNIZE IMPAIRMENTS ON OUR ASSETS.

LITIGATION

OR REGULATORY PROCEEDINGS COULD HARM OUR BUSINESS.

WE MAY BE SUBJECT TO LEGAL CLAIMS OR REGULATORY MATTERS

INVOLVING STOCKHOLDER, CONSUMER, COMPETITION, AND OTHER ISSUES

ON A GLOBAL BASIS. AS DESCRIBED IN NOTE 29.

CONTINGENCIES IN PART II, ITEM 8 OF THIS FORM

10-K,

WE ARE

CURRENTLY ENGAGED IN A NUMBER OF LITIGATION AND REGULATORY

MATTERS. LITIGATION AND REGULATORY PROCEEDINGS ARE SUBJECT TO

INHERENT UNCERTAINTIES, AND UNFAVORABLE RULINGS COULD OCCUR. AN

UNFAVORABLE RULING COULD INCLUDE MONETARY DAMAGES OR, IN CASES

FOR WHICH INJUNCTIVE RELIEF IS SOUGHT, AN INJUNCTION PROHIBITING

US FROM MANUFACTURING OR SELLING ONE OR MORE PRODUCTS,

PRECLUDING PARTICULAR BUSINESS PRACTICES, OR REQUIRING OTHER

REMEDIES, SUCH AS COMPULSORY LICENSING OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY.

IF WE WERE TO RECEIVE AN UNFAVORABLE RULING IN A MATTER, OUR

BUSINESS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COULD BE MATERIALLY HARMED.

FLUCTUATIONS

IN THE MIX OF PRODUCTS SOLD MAY HARM OUR FINANCIAL

RESULTS.

BECAUSE OF THE WIDE PRICE DIFFERENCES AMONG AND WITHIN NOTEBOOK,

NETBOOK, TABLET, DESKTOP, AND SERVER MICROPROCESSORS, THE MIX

AND TYPES OF PERFORMANCE CAPABILITIES OF MICROPROCESSORS SOLD

AFFECT THE AVERAGE SELLING PRICE OF OUR PRODUCTS AND HAVE A

SUBSTANTIAL IMPACT ON OUR REVENUE AND GROSS MARGIN. OUR

FINANCIAL RESULTS ALSO DEPEND IN PART ON THE MIX OF OTHER

PRODUCTS THAT WE SELL, SUCH AS CHIPSETS, FLASH MEMORY, AND OTHER

SEMICONDUCTOR PRODUCTS. IN ADDITION, MORE RECENTLY INTRODUCED

PRODUCTS TEND TO HAVE HIGHER ASSOCIATED COSTS BECAUSE OF INITIAL

OVERALL DEVELOPMENT AND PRODUCTION RAMP. FLUCTUATIONS IN THE MIX

AND TYPES OF OUR PRODUCTS MAY ALSO AFFECT THE EXTENT TO WHICH WE

ARE ABLE TO RECOVER THE FIXED COSTS AND INVESTMENTS ASSOCIATED

WITH A PARTICULAR PRODUCT, AND AS A RESULT CAN HARM OUR

FINANCIAL RESULTS.

OUR

GLOBAL OPERATIONS SUBJECT US TO RISKS THAT MAY HARM OUR RESULTS

OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

WE HAVE SALES OFFICES, R&D, MANUFACTURING, AND ASSEMBLY AND

TEST FACILITIES IN MANY COUNTRIES, AND SOME BUSINESS ACTIVITIES

MAY BE CONCENTRATED IN ONE OR MORE GEOGRAPHIC AREAS. AS A

RESULT, WE ARE SUBJECT TO RISKS THAT MAY LIMIT OUR ABILITY TO

MANUFACTURE, ASSEMBLE AND TEST, DESIGN, DEVELOP, OR SELL

PRODUCTS IN PARTICULAR COUNTRIES OR ON A GEOGRAPHIC BASIS, WHICH

COULD HARM OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION,

INCLUDING.



SECURITY CONCERNS, SUCH AS ARMED CONFLICT AND CIVIL OR MILITARY

UNREST, CRIME, POLITICAL INSTABILITY, AND TERRORIST ACTIVITY;



HEALTH CONCERNS;



NATURAL DISASTERS;



INEFFICIENT AND LIMITED INFRASTRUCTURE AND DISRUPTIONS, SUCH AS

LARGE-SCALE OUTAGES OR INTERRUPTIONS OF SERVICE FROM UTILITIES,

TRANSPORTATION, OR TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROVIDERS AND SUPPLY CHAIN

INTERRUPTIONS;



RESTRICTIONS ON OUR OPERATIONS BY GOVERNMENTS SEEKING TO SUPPORT

LOCAL INDUSTRIES, NATIONALIZATION OF OUR OPERATIONS, AND

RESTRICTIONS ON OUR ABILITY TO REPATRIATE EARNINGS;



DIFFERING EMPLOYMENT PRACTICES AND LABOR ISSUES;



LOCAL BUSINESS AND CULTURAL FACTORS THAT DIFFER FROM OUR NORMAL

STANDARDS AND PRACTICES, INCLUDING BUSINESS PRACTICES THAT WE

ARE PROHIBITED FROM ENGAGING IN BY THE FOREIGN CORRUPT PRACTICES

ACT AND OTHER ANTI-CORRUPTION LAWS AND REGULATIONS; AND



REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS AND PROHIBITIONS THAT DIFFER AMONG

JURISDICTIONS.

VIOLATIONS OF THESE LAWS AND REGULATIONS COULD RESULT IN FINES;

CRIMINAL SANCTIONS AGAINST US, OUR OFFICERS, OR OUR EMPLOYEES;

PROHIBITIONS ON THE CONDUCT OF OUR BUSINESS; AND DAMAGE TO OUR

REPUTATION. ALTHOUGH WE HAVE IMPLEMENTED POLICIES, CONTROLS, AND

PROCEDURES DESIGNED TO ENSURE COMPLIANCE WITH THESE LAWS, OUR

EMPLOYEES, CONTRACTORS, OR AGENTS MAY VIOLATE OUR POLICIES.

IN ADDITION, ALTHOUGH SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR PRODUCTS ARE SOLD

IN U.S. DOLLARS, WE INCUR A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF CERTAIN TYPES

OF EXPENSES, SUCH AS PAYROLL, UTILITIES, TAX, AND MARKETING

EXPENSES, AS WELL AS CONDUCT CERTAIN INVESTING AND FINANCING

ACTIVITIES, IN LOCAL CURRENCIES. OUR HEDGING PROGRAMS REDUCE,

BUT DO NOT ENTIRELY ELIMINATE, THE IMPACT OF CURRENCY EXCHANGE

RATE MOVEMENTS; THEREFORE, FLUCTUATIONS IN EXCHANGE RATES COULD

HARM OUR RESULTS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. IN ADDITION, CHANGES

IN TARIFF AND IMPORT REGULATIONS AND IN U.S. AND

NON-U.S.

MONETARY POLICIES MAY HARM OUR RESULTS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

BY INCREASING OUR EXPENSES AND REDUCING OUR REVENUE. VARYING TAX

RATES IN DIFFERENT JURISDICTIONS COULD HARM OUR RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION BY INCREASING OUR OVERALL TAX

RATE.

WE MAINTAIN A PROGRAM OF INSURANCE COVERAGE FOR VARIOUS TYPES OF

PROPERTY, CASUALTY, AND OTHER RISKS. WE PLACE OUR INSURANCE

COVERAGE WITH VARIOUS CARRIERS IN NUMEROUS JURISDICTIONS.

HOWEVER, THERE IS A RISK THAT ONE OR MORE OF OUR INSURANCE

PROVIDERS MAY BE UNABLE TO PAY A CLAIM. THE TYPES AND AMOUNTS OF

INSURANCE THAT WE OBTAIN VARY FROM TIME TO TIME AND FROM

LOCATION TO LOCATION, DEPENDING ON AVAILABILITY, COST, AND OUR

DECISIONS WITH RESPECT TO RISK RETENTION. THE POLICIES ARE

SUBJECT TO DEDUCTIBLES AND EXCLUSIONS THAT RESULT IN OUR

RETENTION OF A LEVEL OF RISK ON A SELF-INSURANCE BASIS. LOSSES

NOT COVERED BY INSURANCE MAY BE SUBSTANTIAL, WHICH COULD HARM

OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

FAILURE

TO MEET OUR PRODUCTION TARGETS, RESULTING IN UNDERSUPPLY OR

OVERSUPPLY OF PRODUCTS, MAY HARM OUR BUSINESS AND RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS.

PRODUCTION OF INTEGRATED CIRCUITS IS A COMPLEX PROCESS.

DISRUPTIONS IN THIS PROCESS CAN RESULT FROM INTERRUPTIONS IN OUR

PROCESSES, ERRORS, AND DIFFICULTIES IN OUR DEVELOPMENT AND

IMPLEMENTATION OF NEW PROCESSES; DEFECTS IN MATERIALS;

DISRUPTIONS IN OUR SUPPLY OF MATERIALS OR RESOURCES; AND

DISRUPTIONS AT OUR FABRICATION AND ASSEMBLY AND TEST FACILITIES

DUE TO, FOR EXAMPLE, ACCIDENTS, MAINTENANCE ISSUES, OR UNSAFE

WORKING CONDITIONSALL OF WHICH COULD AFFECT THE TIMING OF

PRODUCTION RAMPS AND YIELDS. WE MAY NOT BE SUCCESSFUL OR

EFFICIENT IN DEVELOPING OR IMPLEMENTING NEW PRODUCTION

PROCESSES. THE OCCURRENCE OF ANY OF THE FOREGOING MAY RESULT IN

OUR FAILURE TO MEET OR INCREASE PRODUCTION AS DESIRED, RESULTING

IN HIGHER COSTS OR SUBSTANTIAL DECREASES IN YIELDS, WHICH COULD

AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO PRODUCE SUFFICIENT VOLUME TO MEET SPECIFIC

PRODUCT DEMAND. THE UNAVAILABILITY OR REDUCED AVAILABILITY OF

CERTAIN PRODUCTS COULD MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT TO DELIVER

COMPUTING PLATFORMS. THE OCCURRENCE OF ANY OF THESE EVENTS COULD

HARM OUR BUSINESS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

WE MAY

HAVE DIFFICULTIES OBTAINING THE RESOURCES OR PRODUCTS WE NEED

FOR MANUFACTURING, ASSEMBLING AND TESTING OUR PRODUCTS, OR

OPERATING OTHER ASPECTS OF OUR BUSINESS, WHICH COULD HARM OUR

ABILITY TO MEET DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS AND MAY INCREASE OUR

COSTS.

WE HAVE THOUSANDS OF SUPPLIERS PROVIDING VARIOUS MATERIALS THAT

WE USE IN THE PRODUCTION OF OUR PRODUCTS AND OTHER ASPECTS OF

OUR BUSINESS, AND WE SEEK, WHERE POSSIBLE, TO HAVE SEVERAL

SOURCES OF SUPPLY FOR ALL OF THOSE MATERIALS. HOWEVER, WE MAY

RELY ON A SINGLE OR A LIMITED NUMBER OF SUPPLIERS, OR UPON

SUPPLIERS IN A SINGLE COUNTRY, FOR THESE MATERIALS. THE

INABILITY OF SUCH SUPPLIERS TO DELIVER ADEQUATE SUPPLIES OF

PRODUCTION MATERIALS OR OTHER SUPPLIES COULD DISRUPT OUR

PRODUCTION PROCESSES OR COULD MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR US TO

IMPLEMENT OUR BUSINESS STRATEGY. IN ADDITION, PRODUCTION COULD

BE DISRUPTED BY THE UNAVAILABILITY OF THE RESOURCES USED IN

PRODUCTION, SUCH AS WATER, SILICON, ELECTRICITY, GASES, AND

OTHER MATERIALS. FUTURE ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS COULD RESTRICT

THE SUPPLY OR INCREASE THE COST OF CERTAIN OF THE MATERIALS THAT

WE CURRENTLY USE IN OUR BUSINESS. ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS ALSO

MAY MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT TO OBTAIN PERMITS TO BUILD OR MODIFY

ADDITIONAL MANUFACTURING CAPACITY TO MEET DEMAND. THE

UNAVAILABILITY OR REDUCED AVAILABILITY OF THE MATERIALS OR

RESOURCES THAT WE USE IN OUR BUSINESS MAY REQUIRE US TO REDUCE

PRODUCTION OF PRODUCTS OR MAY REQUIRE US TO INCUR ADDITIONAL

COSTS IN ORDER TO OBTAIN AN ADEQUATE SUPPLY OF THOSE MATERIALS

OR RESOURCES. THE OCCURRENCE OF ANY OF THESE EVENTS COULD HARM

OUR BUSINESS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

COSTS

RELATED TO PRODUCT DEFECTS AND ERRATA MAY HARM OUR RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS AND BUSINESS.

COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH UNEXPECTED PRODUCT DEFECTS AND ERRATA

(DEVIATIONS FROM PUBLISHED SPECIFICATIONS) DUE TO, FOR EXAMPLE,

UNANTICIPATED PROBLEMS IN OUR DESIGN AND MANUFACTURING

PROCESSES, COULD INCLUDE.



WRITING OFF THE VALUE OF INVENTORY OF SUCH PRODUCTS;



DISPOSING OF PRODUCTS THAT CANNOT BE FIXED;



RECALLING SUCH PRODUCTS THAT HAVE BEEN SHIPPED TO CUSTOMERS;



PROVIDING PRODUCT REPLACEMENTS FOR, OR MODIFICATIONS TO, SUCH

PRODUCTS; AND



DEFENDING AGAINST LITIGATION RELATED TO SUCH PRODUCTS.

THESE COSTS COULD BE SUBSTANTIAL AND MAY THEREFORE INCREASE OUR

EXPENSES AND LOWER OUR GROSS MARGIN. IN ADDITION, OUR REPUTATION

WITH OUR CUSTOMERS OR USERS OF OUR PRODUCTS COULD BE DAMAGED AS

A RESULT OF SUCH PRODUCT DEFECTS AND ERRATA, AND THE DEMAND FOR

OUR PRODUCTS COULD BE REDUCED. THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF PRODUCT

DEFECTS

AND/OR

ERRATA COULD CAUSE CUSTOMERS TO PURCHASE PRODUCTS FROM OUR

COMPETITORS AS A RESULT OF ANTICIPATED SHORTAGES OF INTEL

COMPONENTS OR FOR OTHER REASONS. THESE FACTORS COULD HARM OUR

FINANCIAL RESULTS AND THE PROSPECTS FOR OUR BUSINESS.

WE MAY

BE SUBJECT TO CLAIMS OF INFRINGEMENT OF THIRD-PARTY INTELLECTUAL

PROPERTY RIGHTS, WHICH COULD HARM OUR BUSINESS.

THIRD PARTIES MAY ASSERT AGAINST US OR OUR CUSTOMERS ALLEGED

PATENT, COPYRIGHT, TRADEMARK, OR OTHER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

RIGHTS TO TECHNOLOGIES THAT ARE IMPORTANT TO OUR BUSINESS. WE

ARE CURRENTLY ENGAGED IN A NUMBER OF LITIGATION MATTERS

INVOLVING INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS. WE MAY BE SUBJECT TO

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY INFRINGEMENT CLAIMS FROM CERTAIN

INDIVIDUALS AND COMPANIES, INCLUDING THOSE WHO HAVE ACQUIRED

PATENT PORTFOLIOS FOR THE SOLE PURPOSE OF ASSERTING SUCH CLAIMS

AGAINST OTHER COMPANIES. ANY CLAIMS THAT OUR PRODUCTS OR

PROCESSES INFRINGE THE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS OF OTHERS,

REGARDLESS OF THE MERIT OR RESOLUTION OF SUCH CLAIMS, COULD

CAUSE US TO INCUR SIGNIFICANT COSTS IN RESPONDING TO, DEFENDING,

AND RESOLVING SUCH CLAIMS, AND MAY DIVERT THE EFFORTS AND

ATTENTION OF OUR MANAGEMENT AND TECHNICAL PERSONNEL FROM OUR

BUSINESS. AS A RESULT OF SUCH INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY INFRINGEMENT

CLAIMS, WE COULD BE REQUIRED OR OTHERWISE DECIDE THAT IT IS

APPROPRIATE TO.



PAY THIRD-PARTY INFRINGEMENT CLAIMS;



DISCONTINUE MANUFACTURING, USING, OR SELLING PARTICULAR PRODUCTS

SUBJECT TO INFRINGEMENT CLAIMS;



DISCONTINUE USING THE TECHNOLOGY OR PROCESSES SUBJECT TO

INFRINGEMENT CLAIMS;



DEVELOP OTHER TECHNOLOGY NOT SUBJECT TO INFRINGEMENT CLAIMS,

WHICH COULD BE TIME-CONSUMING AND COSTLY OR MAY NOT BE POSSIBLE;

OR



LICENSE TECHNOLOGY FROM THE THIRD PARTY CLAIMING INFRINGEMENT,

WHICH LICENSE MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE ON COMMERCIALLY REASONABLE

TERMS.

THE OCCURRENCE OF ANY OF THE FOREGOING COULD RESULT IN

UNEXPECTED EXPENSES OR REQUIRE US TO RECOGNIZE AN IMPAIRMENT OF

OUR ASSETS, WHICH WOULD REDUCE THE VALUE OF OUR ASSETS AND

INCREASE EXPENSES. IN ADDITION, IF WE ALTER OR DISCONTINUE OUR

PRODUCTION OF AFFECTED ITEMS, OUR REVENUE COULD BE HARMED.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO ENFORCE OR PROTECT OUR INTELLECTUAL

PROPERTY RIGHTS, WHICH MAY HARM OUR ABILITY TO COMPETE AND HARM

OUR BUSINESS.

OUR ABILITY TO ENFORCE OUR PATENTS, COPYRIGHTS, SOFTWARE

LICENSES, AND OTHER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS IS SUBJECT TO

GENERAL LITIGATION RISKS, AS WELL AS UNCERTAINTY AS TO THE

ENFORCEABILITY OF OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS IN VARIOUS

COUNTRIES. WHEN WE SEEK TO ENFORCE OUR RIGHTS, WE ARE OFTEN

SUBJECT TO CLAIMS THAT THE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHT IS

INVALID, IS OTHERWISE NOT ENFORCEABLE, OR IS LICENSED TO THE

PARTY AGAINST WHOM WE ARE ASSERTING A CLAIM. IN ADDITION, OUR

ASSERTION OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS OFTEN RESULTS IN THE

OTHER PARTY SEEKING TO ASSERT ALLEGED INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

RIGHTS OF ITS OWN OR ASSERT OTHER CLAIMS AGAINST US, WHICH COULD

HARM OUR BUSINESS. IF WE ARE NOT ULTIMATELY SUCCESSFUL IN

DEFENDING OURSELVES AGAINST THESE CLAIMS IN LITIGATION, WE MAY

NOT BE ABLE TO SELL A PARTICULAR PRODUCT OR FAMILY OF PRODUCTS

DUE TO AN INJUNCTION, OR WE MAY HAVE TO LICENSE THE TECHNOLOGY

OR PAY DAMAGES THAT COULD, IN TURN, HARM OUR RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS. IN ADDITION, GOVERNMENTS MAY ADOPT REGULATIONS, AND

GOVERNMENTS OR COURTS MAY RENDER DECISIONS, REQUIRING COMPULSORY

LICENSING OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY TO OTHERS, OR GOVERNMENTS MAY

REQUIRE THAT PRODUCTS MEET SPECIFIED STANDARDS THAT SERVE TO

FAVOR LOCAL COMPANIES. OUR INABILITY TO ENFORCE OUR INTELLECTUAL

PROPERTY RIGHTS UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES MAY HARM OUR

COMPETITIVE POSITION AND OUR BUSINESS.

WE MAY

BE SUBJECT TO INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY THEFT OR MISUSE, WHICH COULD

RESULT IN THIRD-PARTY CLAIMS AND HARM OUR BUSINESS AND RESULTS

OF OPERATIONS.

WE REGULARLY FACE ATTEMPTS BY OTHERS TO GAIN UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS

THROUGH THE INTERNET TO OUR INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS, SUCH

AS WHEN THEY MASQUERADE AS AUTHORIZED USERS OR SURREPTITIOUSLY

INTRODUCE SOFTWARE. THESE ATTEMPTS, WHICH MIGHT BE THE RESULT OF

INDUSTRIAL OR OTHER ESPIONAGE, OR ACTIONS BY HACKERS SEEKING TO

HARM THE COMPANY, ITS PRODUCTS, OR END USERS, ARE SOMETIMES

SUCCESSFUL. WE SEEK TO DETECT AND INVESTIGATE THESE SECURITY

INCIDENTS AND TO PREVENT THEIR RECURRENCE, BUT IN SOME CASES WE

MIGHT BE UNAWARE OF AN INCIDENT OR ITS MAGNITUDE AND EFFECTS.

THE THEFT OR UNAUTHORIZED USE OR PUBLICATION OF OUR TRADE

SECRETS AND OTHER CONFIDENTIAL BUSINESS INFORMATION AS A RESULT

OF SUCH AN INCIDENT COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR COMPETITIVE

POSITION AND REDUCE MARKETPLACE ACCEPTANCE OF OUR PRODUCTS; THE

VALUE OF OUR INVESTMENT IN R&D, PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT, AND

MARKETING COULD BE REDUCED; AND THIRD PARTIES MIGHT ASSERT

AGAINST US OR OUR CUSTOMERS CLAIMS RELATED TO RESULTING LOSSES

OF CONFIDENTIAL OR PROPRIETARY INFORMATION OR END-USER DATA, OR

SYSTEM RELIABILITY. OUR BUSINESS COULD BE SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT

DISRUPTION, AND WE COULD SUFFER MONETARY AND OTHER LOSSES,

INCLUDING THE COST OF PRODUCT RECALLS AND RETURNS AND

REPUTATIONAL HARM, IN THE EVENT OF SUCH INCIDENTS AND CLAIMS.

OUR

LICENSES WITH OTHER COMPANIES AND OUR PARTICIPATION IN INDUSTRY

INITIATIVES MAY ALLOW OTHER COMPANIES, INCLUDING OUR

COMPETITORS, TO USE OUR PATENT RIGHTS.

COMPANIES IN THE SEMICONDUCTOR INDUSTRY OFTEN RELY ON THE

ABILITY TO LICENSE PATENTS FROM EACH OTHER IN ORDER TO COMPETE.

MANY OF OUR COMPETITORS HAVE BROAD LICENSES OR CROSS-LICENSES

WITH US, AND UNDER CURRENT CASE LAW, SOME OF THE LICENSES MAY

PERMIT THESE COMPETITORS TO PASS OUR PATENT RIGHTS ON TO OTHERS.

IF ONE OF THESE LICENSEES BECOMES A FOUNDRY, OUR COMPETITORS

MIGHT BE ABLE TO AVOID OUR PATENT RIGHTS IN MANUFACTURING

COMPETING PRODUCTS. IN ADDITION, OUR PARTICIPATION IN INDUSTRY

INITIATIVES MAY REQUIRE US TO LICENSE OUR PATENTS TO OTHER

COMPANIES THAT ADOPT CERTAIN INDUSTRY STANDARDS OR

SPECIFICATIONS, EVEN WHEN SUCH ORGANIZATIONS DO NOT ADOPT

STANDARDS OR SPECIFICATIONS PROPOSED BY US. AS A RESULT, OUR

PATENTS IMPLICATED BY OUR PARTICIPATION IN INDUSTRY INITIATIVES

MIGHT NOT BE AVAILABLE FOR US TO ENFORCE AGAINST OTHERS WHO

MIGHT OTHERWISE BE DEEMED TO BE INFRINGING THOSE PATENTS, OUR

COSTS OF ENFORCING OUR LICENSES OR PROTECTING OUR PATENTS MAY

INCREASE, AND THE VALUE OF OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY MAY BE

IMPAIRED.

WE

INVEST IN COMPANIES FOR STRATEGIC REASONS AND MAY NOT REALIZE A

RETURN ON OUR INVESTMENTS.

WE MAKE INVESTMENTS IN COMPANIES AROUND THE WORLD TO FURTHER OUR

STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES AND SUPPORT OUR KEY BUSINESS INITIATIVES.

SUCH INVESTMENTS INCLUDE EQUITY OR DEBT INSTRUMENTS OF PUBLIC OR

PRIVATE COMPANIES, AND MANY OF THESE INSTRUMENTS ARE

NON-MARKETABLE AT THE TIME OF OUR INITIAL INVESTMENT. THESE

COMPANIES RANGE FROM EARLY-STAGE COMPANIES THAT ARE OFTEN STILL

DEFINING THEIR STRATEGIC DIRECTION TO MORE MATURE COMPANIES WITH

ESTABLISHED REVENUE STREAMS AND BUSINESS MODELS. THE SUCCESS OF

THESE COMPANIES IS DEPENDENT ON PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT, MARKET

ACCEPTANCE, OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCY, AND OTHER KEY BUSINESS

FACTORS. THE COMPANIES IN WHICH WE INVEST MAY FAIL BECAUSE THEY

MAY NOT BE ABLE TO SECURE ADDITIONAL FUNDING, OBTAIN FAVORABLE

INVESTMENT TERMS FOR FUTURE FINANCINGS, OR PARTICIPATE IN

LIQUIDITY EVENTS SUCH AS PUBLIC OFFERINGS, MERGERS, AND PRIVATE

SALES. IF ANY OF THESE PRIVATE COMPANIES FAIL, WE COULD LOSE ALL

OR PART OF OUR INVESTMENT IN THAT COMPANY. IF WE DETERMINE THAT

AN

OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY

DECLINE IN THE FAIR VALUE EXISTS FOR AN EQUITY OR DEBT

INVESTMENT IN A PUBLIC OR PRIVATE COMPANY IN WHICH WE HAVE

INVESTED, WE WRITE DOWN THE INVESTMENT TO ITS FAIR VALUE AND

RECOGNIZE THE RELATED WRITE-DOWN AS AN INVESTMENT LOSS. WE ALSO

HAVE SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS IN COMPANIES IN THE FLASH MEMORY

MARKET SEGMENT, AND DECLINES IN THIS MARKET SEGMENT OR CHANGES

IN MANAGEMENTS PLANS WITH RESPECT TO OUR INVESTMENTS IN

THIS MARKET SEGMENT COULD RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT IMPAIRMENT

CHARGES, IMPACTING GAINS (LOSSES) ON EQUITY METHOD INVESTMENTS,

NET AND GAINS (LOSSES) ON OTHER EQUITY INVESTMENTS, NET.

WHEN THE STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES OF AN INVESTMENT HAVE BEEN

ACHIEVED, OR IF THE INVESTMENT OR BUSINESS DIVERGES FROM OUR

STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES, WE MAY DECIDE TO DISPOSE OF THE

INVESTMENT. WE MAY INCUR LOSSES ON THE DISPOSAL OF OUR

NON-MARKETABLE INVESTMENTS. ADDITIONALLY, FOR CASES IN WHICH WE

ARE REQUIRED UNDER EQUITY METHOD ACCOUNTING TO RECOGNIZE A

PROPORTIONATE SHARE OF ANOTHER COMPANYS INCOME OR LOSS,

SUCH INCOME OR LOSS MAY IMPACT OUR EARNINGS. GAINS OR LOSSES

FROM EQUITY SECURITIES COULD VARY FROM EXPECTATIONS DEPENDING ON

GAINS OR LOSSES REALIZED ON THE SALE OR EXCHANGE OF SECURITIES,

GAINS OR LOSSES FROM EQUITY METHOD INVESTMENTS, AND IMPAIRMENT

CHARGES FOR EQUITY AND OTHER INVESTMENTS.

OUR

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COULD VARY AS A RESULT OF THE METHODS,

THE METHODS, ESTIMATES, AND JUDGMENTS THAT WE USE IN APPLYING

OUR ACCOUNTING POLICIES HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON OUR RESULTS

OF OPERATIONS (SEE CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES IN

PART II, ITEM 7 OF THIS FORM

10-K).

SUCH

METHODS, ESTIMATES, AND JUDGMENTS ARE, BY THEIR NATURE, SUBJECT

TO SUBSTANTIAL RISKS, UNCERTAINTIES, AND ASSUMPTIONS, AND

FACTORS MAY ARISE OVER TIME THAT LEAD US TO CHANGE OUR METHODS,

ESTIMATES, AND JUDGMENTS. CHANGES IN THOSE METHODS, ESTIMATES,

AND JUDGMENTS COULD SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS.

DECISIONS

ABOUT THE SCOPE OF OPERATIONS OF OUR BUSINESS COULD AFFECT OUR

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

CHANGES IN THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT COULD LEAD TO CHANGES IN OUR

DECISIONS ABOUT THE SCOPE OF OPERATIONS OF OUR BUSINESS, AND

THESE CHANGES COULD RESULT IN RESTRUCTURING AND ASSET IMPAIRMENT

CHARGES. FACTORS THAT COULD AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND

FINANCIAL CONDITION WITH REGARD TO CHANGING THE SCOPE OF OUR

OPERATIONS INCLUDE.



TIMING AND EXECUTION OF PLANS AND PROGRAMS THAT MAY BE SUBJECT

TO LOCAL LABOR LAW REQUIREMENTS, INCLUDING CONSULTATION WITH

APPROPRIATE WORK COUNCILS;



CHANGES IN ASSUMPTIONS RELATED TO SEVERANCE AND POSTRETIREMENT

COSTS;



FUTURE DIVESTITURES;



NEW BUSINESS INITIATIVES AND CHANGES IN PRODUCT ROADMAP,

DEVELOPMENT, AND MANUFACTURING;



CHANGES IN EMPLOYMENT LEVELS AND TURNOVER RATES;



CHANGES IN PRODUCT DEMAND AND THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT; AND



CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF CERTAIN LONG-LIVED ASSETS.

OUR

ACQUISITIONS, DIVESTITURES, AND OTHER TRANSACTIONS COULD DISRUPT

OUR ONGOING BUSINESS AND HARM OUR RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS.

IN PURSUING OUR BUSINESS STRATEGY, WE ROUTINELY CONDUCT

DISCUSSIONS, EVALUATE OPPORTUNITIES, AND ENTER INTO AGREEMENTS

REGARDING POSSIBLE INVESTMENTS, ACQUISITIONS, DIVESTITURES, AND

OTHER TRANSACTIONS, SUCH AS JOINT VENTURES. ACQUISITIONS AND

OTHER TRANSACTIONS INVOLVE SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES AND RISKS,

INCLUDING RISKS THAT.



WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO IDENTIFY SUITABLE OPPORTUNITIES AT TERMS

ACCEPTABLE TO US;



THE TRANSACTION MAY NOT ADVANCE OUR BUSINESS STRATEGY;



WE MAY NOT REALIZE A SATISFACTORY RETURN ON THE INVESTMENT WE

MAKE;



WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO RETAIN KEY PERSONNEL OF THE ACQUIRED

BUSINESS;



WE MAY EXPERIENCE DIFFICULTY IN INTEGRATING NEW EMPLOYEES,

BUSINESS SYSTEMS, AND TECHNOLOGY;



ACQUIRED BUSINESSES MAY NOT HAVE ADEQUATE CONTROLS, PROCESSES,

AND PROCEDURES TO ENSURE COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS AND REGULATIONS

GLOBALLY, AND OUR DUE DILIGENCE PROCESS MAY NOT IDENTIFY

COMPLIANCE ISSUES OR OTHER LIABILITIES THAT ARE IN EXISTENCE AT

THE TIME OF OUR ACQUISITION;



WE MAY HAVE DIFFICULTY ENTERING INTO NEW MARKET SEGMENTS IN

WHICH WE ARE NOT EXPERIENCED; OR



WE MAY BE UNABLE TO RETAIN THE CUSTOMERS AND PARTNERS OF

ACQUIRED BUSINESSES FOLLOWING THE ACQUISITION.

WHEN WE DECIDE TO SELL ASSETS OR A BUSINESS, WE MAY ENCOUNTER

DIFFICULTY IN FINDING OR COMPLETING DIVESTITURE OPPORTUNITIES OR

ALTERNATIVE EXIT STRATEGIES ON ACCEPTABLE TERMS IN A TIMELY

MANNER, AND THE AGREED TERMS AND FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS COULD BE

RENEGOTIATED DUE TO CHANGES IN BUSINESS OR MARKET CONDITIONS.

THESE CIRCUMSTANCES COULD DELAY THE ACCOMPLISHMENT OF OUR

STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES OR CAUSE US TO INCUR ADDITIONAL EXPENSES

WITH RESPECT TO BUSINESSES THAT WE WANT TO DISPOSE OF, OR WE MAY

DISPOSE OF A BUSINESS AT A PRICE OR ON TERMS THAT ARE LESS

FAVORABLE THAN WE HAD ANTICIPATED, RESULTING IN A LOSS ON THE

TRANSACTION.

IF WE DO ENTER INTO AGREEMENTS WITH RESPECT TO ACQUISITIONS,

DIVESTITURES, OR OTHER TRANSACTIONS, WE MAY FAIL TO COMPLETE

THEM DUE TO FACTORS SUCH AS.



FAILURE TO OBTAIN REQUIRED REGULATORY OR OTHER APPROVALS;



INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY OR OTHER LITIGATION; OR



DIFFICULTIES THAT WE OR OTHER PARTIES MAY ENCOUNTER IN OBTAINING

FINANCING FOR THE TRANSACTION.

IN

ORDER TO COMPETE, WE MUST ATTRACT, RETAIN, AND MOTIVATE KEY

EMPLOYEES, AND OUR FAILURE TO DO SO COULD HARM OUR RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS.

IN ORDER TO COMPETE, WE MUST ATTRACT, RETAIN, AND MOTIVATE

EXECUTIVES AND OTHER KEY EMPLOYEES. HIRING AND RETAINING

QUALIFIED EXECUTIVES, SCIENTISTS, ENGINEERS, TECHNICAL STAFF,

AND SALES REPRESENTATIVES ARE CRITICAL TO OUR BUSINESS, AND

COMPETITION FOR EXPERIENCED EMPLOYEES IN THE SEMICONDUCTOR

INDUSTRY CAN BE INTENSE. TO HELP ATTRACT, RETAIN, AND MOTIVATE

QUALIFIED EMPLOYEES, WE USE SHARE-BASED INCENTIVE AWARDS SUCH AS

NON-VESTED SHARE UNITS (RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS) AND EMPLOYEE

STOCK OPTIONS. IF THE VALUE OF SUCH STOCK AWARDS DOES NOT

APPRECIATE AS MEASURED BY THE PERFORMANCE OF THE PRICE OF OUR

COMMON STOCK, OR IF OUR SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION OTHERWISE

CEASES TO BE VIEWED AS A VALUABLE BENEFIT, OUR ABILITY TO

ATTRACT, RETAIN, AND MOTIVATE EMPLOYEES COULD BE WEAKENED, WHICH

COULD HARM OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

OUR

FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH APPLICABLE ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND

REGULATIONS WORLDWIDE COULD HARM OUR BUSINESS AND RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS.

THE MANUFACTURING AND ASSEMBLING AND TESTING OF OUR PRODUCTS

REQUIRE THE USE OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS THAT ARE SUBJECT TO A

BROAD ARRAY OF EHS LAWS AND REGULATIONS. OUR FAILURE TO COMPLY

WITH ANY OF THOSE APPLICABLE LAWS OR REGULATIONS COULD RESULT IN.



REGULATORY PENALTIES, FINES, AND LEGAL LIABILITIES;



SUSPENSION OF PRODUCTION;



ALTERATION OF OUR FABRICATION AND ASSEMBLY AND TEST PROCESSES;

AND



CURTAILMENT OF OUR OPERATIONS OR SALES.

IN ADDITION, OUR FAILURE TO MANAGE THE USE, TRANSPORTATION,

EMISSIONS, DISCHARGE, STORAGE, RECYCLING, OR DISPOSAL OF

HAZARDOUS MATERIALS COULD SUBJECT US TO INCREASED COSTS OR

FUTURE LIABILITIES. EXISTING AND FUTURE ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND

REGULATIONS COULD ALSO REQUIRE US TO ACQUIRE POLLUTION ABATEMENT

OR REMEDIATION EQUIPMENT, MODIFY OUR PRODUCT DESIGNS, OR INCUR

OTHER EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH SUCH LAWS AND REGULATIONS. MANY

NEW MATERIALS THAT WE ARE EVALUATING FOR USE IN OUR OPERATIONS

MAY BE SUBJECT TO REGULATION UNDER EXISTING OR FUTURE

ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS THAT MAY RESTRICT OUR USE OF

ONE OR MORE OF SUCH MATERIALS IN OUR MANUFACTURING, ASSEMBLY AND

TEST PROCESSES, OR PRODUCTS. ANY OF THESE RESTRICTIONS COULD

HARM OUR BUSINESS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS BY INCREASING OUR

EXPENSES OR REQUIRING US TO ALTER OUR MANUFACTURING AND ASSEMBLY

AND TEST PROCESSES.

CLIMATE

CHANGE POSES BOTH REGULATORY AND PHYSICAL RISKS THAT COULD HARM

OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR AFFECT THE WAY WE CONDUCT OUR

BUSINESS.

IN ADDITION TO THE POSSIBLE DIRECT ECONOMIC IMPACT THAT CLIMATE

CHANGE COULD HAVE ON US, CLIMATE CHANGE MITIGATION PROGRAMS AND

REGULATIONS CAN INCREASE OUR COSTS. FOR EXAMPLE, THE COST OF

PERFLUOROCOMPOUNDS (PFCS), A GAS THAT WE USE IN MANUFACTURING,

COULD INCREASE OVER TIME UNDER SOME CLIMATE-CHANGE-FOCUSED

EMISSIONS TRADING PROGRAMS THAT MAY BE IMPOSED BY GOVERNMENT

REGULATION. IF THE USE OF PFCS IS PROHIBITED, WE WOULD NEED TO

OBTAIN SUBSTITUTE MATERIALS THAT MAY COST MORE OR BE LESS

AVAILABLE FOR OUR MANUFACTURING OPERATIONS. IN ADDITION, AIR

QUALITY PERMIT REQUIREMENTS FOR OUR MANUFACTURING OPERATIONS

COULD BECOME MORE BURDENSOME AND CAUSE DELAYS IN OUR ABILITY TO

MODIFY OR BUILD ADDITIONAL MANUFACTURING CAPACITY. UNDER THE

RECENTLY ADOPTED GREENHOUSE GAS REGULATIONS IN THE U.S., MANY OF

OUR MANUFACTURING FACILITIES WILL BECOME MAJOR

SOURCES UNDER THE CLEAN AIR ACT IN 2011. AT A MINIMUM, THIS

CHANGE IN STATUS WILL RESULT IN SOME UNCERTAINTY AS THE EPA

ADOPTS GUIDANCE ON IMPLEMENTATION OF ITS GREENHOUSE GAS

REGULATIONS. DUE TO THE DYNAMIC NATURE OF OUR SEMICONDUCTOR

MANUFACTURING OPERATIONS, IT IS LIKELY THESE NEW REGULATIONS

WILL RESULT IN INCREASED COSTS FOR OUR U.S. OPERATIONS. THESE

COST INCREASES COULD BE ASSOCIATED WITH NEW AIR POLLUTION

CONTROL REQUIREMENTS, AND INCREASED OR NEW MONITORING,

RECORDKEEPING, AND REPORTING OF GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS. WE

ALSO SEE THE POTENTIAL FOR HIGHER ENERGY COSTS DRIVEN BY CLIMATE

CHANGE REGULATIONS. OUR COSTS COULD INCREASE IF UTILITY

COMPANIES PASS ON THEIR COSTS, SUCH AS THOSE ASSOCIATED WITH

CARBON TAXES, EMISSION CAP AND TRADE PROGRAMS, OR RENEWABLE

PORTFOLIO STANDARDS. WHILE WE MAINTAIN BUSINESS RECOVERY PLANS

THAT ARE INTENDED TO ALLOW US TO RECOVER FROM NATURAL DISASTERS

OR OTHER EVENTS THAT CAN BE DISRUPTIVE TO OUR BUSINESS, WE

CANNOT BE SURE THAT OUR PLANS WILL FULLY PROTECT US FROM ALL

SUCH DISASTERS OR EVENTS. MANY OF OUR OPERATIONS ARE LOCATED IN

SEMI-ARID REGIONS, SUCH AS ISRAEL AND THE SOUTHWESTERN U.S. SOME

SCENARIOS PREDICT THAT THESE REGIONS MAY BECOME EVEN MORE

VULNERABLE TO PROLONGED DROUGHTS DUE TO CLIMATE CHANGE.

CHANGES

IN OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE MAY HARM OUR RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS.

A NUMBER OF FACTORS MAY INCREASE OUR FUTURE EFFECTIVE TAX RATES,

INCLUDING.



THE JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH PROFITS ARE DETERMINED TO BE EARNED

AND TAXED;



THE RESOLUTION OF ISSUES ARISING FROM TAX AUDITS WITH VARIOUS

TAX AUTHORITIES;



CHANGES IN THE VALUATION OF OUR DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND

LIABILITIES, AND CHANGES IN DEFERRED TAX VALUATION ALLOWANCES;



ADJUSTMENTS TO INCOME TAXES UPON FINALIZATION OF VARIOUS TAX

RETURNS;



INCREASES IN EXPENSES NOT DEDUCTIBLE FOR TAX PURPOSES, INCLUDING

WRITE-OFFS OF ACQUIRED IN-PROCESS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT AND

IMPAIRMENTS OF GOODWILL IN CONNECTION WITH ACQUISITIONS;



CHANGES IN AVAILABLE TAX CREDITS;



CHANGES IN TAX LAWS OR THE INTERPRETATION OF SUCH TAX LAWS,

INCLUDING CHANGES IN THE U.S. TO THE TAXATION OF FOREIGN INCOME

AND EXPENSES;



CHANGES IN U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES; AND



OUR DECISION TO REPATRIATE

NON-U.S.

EARNINGS FOR WHICH WE HAVE NOT PREVIOUSLY PROVIDED FOR U.S.

TAXES.

ANY SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN OUR FUTURE EFFECTIVE TAX RATES COULD

REDUCE NET INCOME FOR FUTURE PERIODS.

INTEREST

AND OTHER, NET COULD BE IMPACTED BY MACROECONOMIC AND OTHER

FACTORS, HARMING OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

FACTORS THAT COULD CAUSE INTEREST AND OTHER, NET IN OUR

CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME TO FLUCTUATE INCLUDE.



FIXED-INCOME, EQUITY, AND CREDIT MARKET VOLATILITY;



FLUCTUATIONS IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES;



FLUCTUATIONS IN INTEREST RATES;



CHANGES IN THE CREDIT STANDING OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT

COUNTERPARTIES; AND



CHANGES IN OUR CASH AND INVESTMENT BALANCES.

2010 WAS A RECORD YEAR FOR US. STRONG MARKET GROWTH IN THE

BUSINESS AND CONSUMER PC MARKET SEGMENTS AS WELL AS THE

CONTINUED BUILD-OUT OF THE DATA CENTER, THE LEADERSHIP OF OUR

PRODUCT PORTFOLIO, AND IMPROVEMENTS TO OUR COST STRUCTURE ALL

CONTRIBUTED TO THE MOST PROFITABLE YEAR IN OUR HISTORY. REVENUE

INCREASED 24% IN 2010 COMPARED TO 2009. OUR 2010 GROSS MARGIN

PERCENTAGE OF 65.3% INCREASED BY 9.6 PERCENTAGE POINTS FROM

2009, PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY LOWER FACTORY UNDERUTILIZATION

CHARGES, HIGHER MICROPROCESSOR AVERAGE SELLING PRICES, LOWER

PLATFORM (MICROPROCESSOR AND CHIPSET) UNIT COST, AND HIGHER

PLATFORM UNIT SALES. WE EXPECT CONTINUED STRENGTH IN EMERGING

MARKETS COUPLED WITH THE BUILD-OUT OF THE CLOUD COMPUTING

INFRASTRUCTURE TO CONTRIBUTE TOWARD A 2011 REVENUE GROWTH

PERCENTAGE IN THE MID- TO HIGH-TEENS. THIS EXPECTATION IS ALSO

INCLUSIVE OF THE RECENTLY COMPLETED ACQUISITION OF THE WLS

BUSINESS OF INFINEON AND THE EXPECTED ACQUISITION OF MCAFEE IN

THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2011.

IN THE FOURTH QUARTER, WE ACHIEVED RECORD QUARTERLY REVENUE FOR

THE THIRD QUARTER IN A ROW DESPITE CONTINUATION OF THE SOFTNESS

WE SAW IN THE CONSUMER SEGMENTS OF MATURE MARKETS STARTING IN

THE MIDDLE OF THE YEAR. THE SEQUENTIAL DECREASE IN OUR FOURTH

QUARTER GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY CHARGES

TO REPAIR AND REPLACE MATERIALS AND SYSTEMS IMPACTED BY A DESIGN

ISSUE RELATED TO OUR

TABLE OF CONTENTS

MANAGEMENTS

DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)

AS WE ENTER 2011, THE STRENGTH OF OUR PRODUCT PORTFOLIO IS

HIGHLIGHTED WITH THE LAUNCH OF 32NM PROCESS TECHNOLOGY PRODUCTS

BASED ON OUR 2ND GENERATION INTEL CORE PROCESSOR

MICROARCHITECTURE. WE CONTINUE TO DELIVER IMPROVEMENTS IN OUR

PRODUCT OFFERINGS THROUGH OUR TICK-TOCK TECHNOLOGY

DEVELOPMENT CADENCE. WE PLAN TO INVEST $9.0 BILLION IN CAPITAL

ASSETS IN 2011 AS WE BUILD AND EQUIP OUR 22NM PROCESS TECHNOLOGY

MANUFACTURING CAPACITY, WHICH WILL INCREASE OUR LEADING-EDGE

FACILITIES TO FOUR. THIS INCREASE IN CAPITAL SPENDING WILL

ENABLE US TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE SIGNIFICANT MARKET GROWTH

OPPORTUNITIES THAT WE BELIEVE EXIST FOR OUR PRODUCTS ACROSS THE

COMPUTING SPECTRUM, AS WELL AS MOVE MORE TRANSISTORS TO OUR

LEADING-EDGE PROCESS TECHNOLOGIES.

THE CASH-GENERATING POWER OF OUR BUSINESS WAS EVIDENT IN 2010

WITH $16.7 BILLION OF CASH FROM OPERATIONS. FROM A FINANCIAL

CONDITION PERSPECTIVE, WE ENDED 2010 WITH AN INVESTMENT

PORTFOLIO OF $21.5 BILLION, CONSISTING OF CASH AND CASH

EQUIVALENTS, SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS, AND MARKETABLE DEBT

INSTRUMENTS INCLUDED IN TRADING ASSETS. DURING 2010, WE

PURCHASED $5.2 BILLION IN CAPITAL ASSETS, RETURNED $3.5 BILLION

TO STOCKHOLDERS THROUGH DIVIDENDS, AND REPURCHASED $1.5 BILLION

OF COMMON STOCK THROUGH OUR COMMON STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM. IN

JANUARY 2011, OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS DECLARED A DIVIDEND OF

$0.1812 PER COMMON SHARE FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2011, AN

INCREASE OF APPROXIMATELY 15% COMPARED TO OUR FOURTH QUARTER

DIVIDEND, AND INCREASED THE REPURCHASE AUTHORIZATION LIMIT OF

OUR COMMON STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM BY $10 BILLION.

DURING 2010, WE ANNOUNCED A DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT TO ACQUIRE

MCAFEE FOR APPROXIMATELY $7.68 BILLION, AND WE EXPECT TO

COMPLETE THE ACQUISITION IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2011. FOR

FURTHER INFORMATION, SEE NOTE 15: ACQUISITIONS IN

THE

TRANSACTION IS SUBJECT TO CUSTOMARY CLOSING CONDITIONS.

IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2011, WE COMPLETED THE ACQUISITION OF

THE WLS BUSINESS OF INFINEON. TOTAL NET CASH CONSIDERATION FOR

THE ACQUISITION IS ESTIMATED AT $1.4 BILLION. FOR FURTHER

INFORMATION, SEE NOTE 15: ACQUISITIONS IN PART II,

ITEM 8 OF THIS FORM

IN JANUARY 2011, WE ENTERED INTO A LONG-TERM PATENT

CROSS-LICENSE AGREEMENT WITH NVIDIA. UNDER THE AGREEMENT, WE

RECEIVE A LICENSE TO ALL OF NVIDIAS PATENTS, WHILE NVIDIA

PRODUCTS ARE LICENSED TO OUR PATENTS SUBJECT TO EXCLUSIONS FOR

X86 PRODUCTS, CERTAIN CHIPSETS, AND CERTAIN FLASH MEMORY

TECHNOLOGY PRODUCTS. THE AGREEMENT ALSO INCLUDES SETTLEMENT OF

THE EXISTING LITIGATION BETWEEN THE COMPANIES AS WELL AS BROAD

STRATEGY

OUR GOAL IS TO BE THE PREEMINENT COMPUTING SOLUTIONS COMPANY

THAT POWERS THE WORLDWIDE DIGITAL ECONOMY. WE BELIEVE THAT THE

PROLIFERATION OF THE INTERNET AND CLOUD COMPUTING HAVE DRIVEN

FUNDAMENTAL CHANGES IN THE COMPUTING INDUSTRY. WE ARE

TRANSFORMING FROM A COMPANY WITH A PRIMARY FOCUS ON THE DESIGN

AND MANUFACTURE OF SEMICONDUCTOR CHIPS FOR PCS AND SERVERS TO A

COMPUTING COMPANY THAT DELIVERS COMPLETE SOLUTIONS IN THE FORM

OF HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE PLATFORMS AND SUPPORTING SERVICES. THE

NUMBER AND VARIETY OF DEVICES CONNECTED TO THE INTERNET IS

GROWING, AND COMPUTING IS BECOMING AN INCREASINGLY PERSONAL

EXPERIENCE. END USERS VALUE CONSISTENCY ACROSS DEVICES THAT

CONNECT SEAMLESSLY AND EFFORTLESSLY TO THE INTERNET AND TO EACH

OTHER. WE WILL HELP TO ENABLE THIS EXPERIENCE BY INNOVATING

AROUND THREE PILLARS OF COMPUTING: ENERGY-EFFICIENT PERFORMANCE,

CONNECTIVITY, AND SECURITY.



ENERGY-EFFICIENT PERFORMANCE.

WE ARE FOCUSING ON

IMPROVED ENERGY-EFFICIENT PERFORMANCE FOR COMPUTING AND

COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEMS AND DEVICES. IMPROVED ENERGY-EFFICIENT

PERFORMANCE INVOLVES BALANCING HIGHER PERFORMANCE WITH LOWER

POWER CONSUMPTION.



CONNECTIVITY.

WE ARE POSITIONING OUR BUSINESS TO

TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE GROWTH IN DEVICES THAT COMPUTE AND CONNECT

TO THE INTERNET. IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2011, WE ACQUIRED THE

WLS BUSINESS OF INFINEON. THIS ACQUISITION ENABLES US TO OFFER A

PORTFOLIO OF PRODUCTS THAT COVERS A BROAD RANGE OF WIRELESS

CONNECTIVITY OPTIONS BY COMBINING THE

INTEL

®

WIFI AND

INTEL

®

WIMAX TECHNOLOGIES WITH WLS 2G AND 3G TECHNOLOGIES, AND

CREATES A COMBINED PATH TO ACCELERATE INDUSTRY ADOPTION OF 4G

LTE.



SECURITY.

OUR GOAL IS TO ENHANCE SECURITY FEATURES

THROUGH A COMBINATION OF HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE SOLUTIONS. THIS

MAY INCLUDE IDENTITY PROTECTION AND FRAUD DETERRENCE; DETECTION

AND PREVENTION OF MALWARE; SECURING DATA AND ASSETS; AS WELL AS

SYSTEM RECOVERY AND ENHANCED SECURITY PATCHING. WE EXPECT TO

COMPLETE THE ACQUISITION OF MCAFEE IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2011.

WE BELIEVE THAT THIS ACQUISITION WILL ACCELERATE AND ENHANCE OUR

HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE SECURITY SOLUTIONS, IMPROVING THE OVERALL

SECURITY OF OUR PLATFORMS.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

MANAGEMENTS

DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)

TO SUCCEED IN THE CHANGING COMPUTING ENVIRONMENT, WE HAVE THE

FOLLOWING KEY OBJECTIVES.



STRIVE TO ENSURE THAT INTEL TECHNOLOGY REMAINS THE BEST CHOICE

FOR THE PC AS WELL AS CLOUD COMPUTING AND THE DATA CENTER.



EXPAND PLATFORMS INTO ADJACENT MARKET SEGMENTS TO BRING

COMPELLING NEW SOLUTIONS TO THE SMARTPHONE, THE TABLET, THE TV,

THE CAR, AND THE REST OF THE EMBEDDED WORLD.



ENABLE DEVICES THAT CONNECT TO THE INTERNET AND TO EACH OTHER TO

CREATE A CONTINUUM OF PERSONAL COMPUTING. THIS CONTINUUM WOULD

GIVE CONSUMERS A SET OF SECURE, CONSISTENT, AND PERSONALIZED

COMPUTING EXPERIENCES.



POSITIVELY IMPACT THE WORLD THROUGH OUR ACTIONS AND THE

APPLICATION OF OUR ENERGY-EFFICIENT TECHNOLOGY.

WE WILL USE OUR CORE ASSETS TO MEET THESE OBJECTIVES. OUR CORE

ASSETS INCLUDE OUR SILICON AND PROCESS TECHNOLOGY, OUR

ARCHITECTURE AND PLATFORMS, OUR GLOBAL PRESENCE, OUR STRONG

RELATIONSHIPS ACROSS THE INDUSTRY, AND OUR BRAND RECOGNITION. WE

BELIEVE THAT APPLYING THESE CORE ASSETS TO OUR KEY FOCUS AREAS

PROVIDES US WITH THE SCALE, CAPACITY, AND GLOBAL REACH TO

ESTABLISH NEW TECHNOLOGIES AND RESPOND TO CUSTOMERS NEEDS

QUICKLY. SOME OF OUR CORE ASSETS AND KEY FOCUS AREAS ARE.



SILICON AND MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY LEADERSHIP.

WE

HAVE LONG BEEN A LEADER IN SILICON PROCESS TECHNOLOGY AND

MANUFACTURING, AND WE AIM TO CONTINUE OUR LEAD THROUGH

INVESTMENT AND INNOVATION IN THIS CRITICAL AREA. WE DRIVE A

REGULAR TWO-YEAR UPGRADE CYCLEINTRODUCING A NEW

MICROARCHITECTURE APPROXIMATELY EVERY TWO YEARS AND RAMPING THE

NEXT GENERATION OF SILICON PROCESS TECHNOLOGY IN THE INTERVENING

YEARS. WE REFER TO THIS AS OUR TICK-TOCK TECHNOLOGY

DEVELOPMENT CADENCE. AS WE CONTINUE TO DRIVE MOORES LAW

OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS, WE BELIEVE THAT THE VALUE OF THIS

ADVANTAGE WILL INCREASE. WE AIM TO HAVE THE BEST PROCESS

TECHNOLOGY, AND UNLIKE MOST SEMICONDUCTOR COMPANIES, WE

PRIMARILY MANUFACTURE OUR PRODUCTS IN OUR OWN FACILITIES. THIS

ALLOWS US TO OPTIMIZE PERFORMANCE, REDUCE OUR TIME TO MARKET,

AND SCALE NEW PRODUCTS MORE RAPIDLY.



ARCHITECTURE AND PLATFORMS.

WE ARE NOW DEVELOPING A

WIDE RANGE OF SOLUTIONS FOR DEVICES THAT SPAN THE COMPUTING

CRITICAL

ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

THE METHODS, ESTIMATES, AND JUDGMENTS THAT WE USE IN APPLYING

OUR ACCOUNTING POLICIES HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE RESULTS

THAT WE REPORT IN OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. SOME OF

OUR ACCOUNTING POLICIES REQUIRE US TO MAKE DIFFICULT AND

SUBJECTIVE JUDGMENTS, OFTEN AS A RESULT OF THE NEED TO MAKE

ESTIMATES REGARDING MATTERS THAT ARE INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN. OUR

MOST CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES INCLUDE.



THE VALUATION OF NON-MARKETABLE EQUITY INVESTMENTS AND THE

DETERMINATION OF

OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY

IMPAIRMENTS, WHICH IMPACT GAINS (LOSSES) ON EQUITY METHOD

INVESTMENTS, NET, OR GAINS (LOSSES) ON OTHER EQUITY INVESTMENTS,

NET WHEN WE RECORD IMPAIRMENTS;



THE ASSESSMENT OF RECOVERABILITY OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS, WHICH

IMPACTS GROSS MARGIN OR OPERATING EXPENSES WHEN WE RECORD ASSET

IMPAIRMENTS OR ACCELERATE THEIR DEPRECIATION;



THE RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT OF CURRENT AND DEFERRED INCOME

TAXES (INCLUDING THE MEASUREMENT OF UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS),

WHICH IMPACT OUR PROVISION FOR TAXES;



THE VALUATION OF INVENTORY, WHICH IMPACTS GROSS MARGIN; AND



THE RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT OF LOSS CONTINGENCIES, WHICH

IMPACT GROSS MARGIN OR OPERATING EXPENSES WHEN WE RECOGNIZE A

LOSS CONTINGENCY, REVISE THE ESTIMATE FOR A LOSS CONTINGENCY, OR

RECORD AN ASSET IMPAIRMENT.

BELOW, WE DISCUSS THESE POLICIES FURTHER, AS WELL AS THE

ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS INVOLVED.

NON-MARKETABLE

EQUITY INVESTMENTS

WE REGULARLY INVEST IN NON-MARKETABLE EQUITY INSTRUMENTS OF

PRIVATE COMPANIES, WHICH RANGE FROM EARLY-STAGE COMPANIES THAT

ARE OFTEN STILL DEFINING THEIR STRATEGIC DIRECTION TO MORE

MATURE COMPANIES WITH ESTABLISHED REVENUE STREAMS AND BUSINESS

MODELS. THE CARRYING VALUE OF OUR NON-MARKETABLE EQUITY

INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO, EXCLUDING EQUITY DERIVATIVES, TOTALED $2.6

BILLION AS OF DECEMBER 25, 2010 ($3.4 BILLION AS OF DECEMBER 26,

2009). THE MAJORITY OF THIS BALANCE AS OF DECEMBER 25, 2010 WAS

CONCENTRATED IN COMPANIES IN THE FLASH MEMORY MARKET SEGMENT.

OUR FLASH MEMORY MARKET SEGMENT INVESTMENTS INCLUDE OUR

INVESTMENT IN IM FLASH TECHNOLOGIES, LLC (IMFT) AND IM FLASH

SINGAPORE, LLP (IMFS) OF $1.5 BILLION ($1.6 BILLION AS OF

DECEMBER 26, 2009). FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION, SEE NOTE

11: EQUITY METHOD AND COST METHOD INVESTMENTS IN PART II,

ITEM 8 OF THIS FORM

10-K.

OUR NON-MARKETABLE EQUITY INVESTMENTS ARE RECORDED USING THE

COST METHOD OR THE EQUITY METHOD OF ACCOUNTING, DEPENDING ON THE

FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES OF EACH INVESTMENT. OUR NON-MARKETABLE

EQUITY INVESTMENTS ARE CLASSIFIED WITHIN OTHER LONG-TERM ASSETS

ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS.

NON-MARKETABLE EQUITY INVESTMENTS ARE INHERENTLY RISKY, AND

THEIR SUCCESS IS DEPENDENT ON PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT, MARKET

ACCEPTANCE, OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCY, OTHER KEY BUSINESS FACTORS,

AND THE ABILITY OF THE INVESTEE COMPANIES TO RAISE ADDITIONAL

FUNDS IN FINANCIAL MARKETS THAT CAN BE VOLATILE. THE COMPANIES

COULD FAIL OR NOT BE ABLE TO RAISE ADDITIONAL FUNDS WHEN NEEDED,

OR THEY MAY RECEIVE LOWER VALUATIONS WITH LESS FAVORABLE

INVESTMENT TERMS THAN PREVIOUS FINANCINGS. THESE EVENTS COULD

CAUSE OUR INVESTMENTS TO BECOME IMPAIRED. IN ADDITION, FINANCIAL

MARKET VOLATILITY COULD NEGATIVELY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO REALIZE

VALUE IN OUR INVESTMENTS THROUGH LIQUIDITY EVENTS SUCH AS

INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERINGS, MERGERS, AND PRIVATE SALES. FOR

FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO RISKS, SEE

RISK FACTORS IN PART I, ITEM 1A OF THIS FORM

10-K.

WE DETERMINE THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR NON-MARKETABLE EQUITY

INVESTMENTS QUARTERLY FOR DISCLOSURE PURPOSES; HOWEVER, THE

INVESTMENTS ARE RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE ONLY IF AN IMPAIRMENT

CHARGE IS RECOGNIZED. WE DETERMINE THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR

NON-MARKETABLE EQUITY INVESTMENTS USING THE MARKET AND INCOME

APPROACHES. THE MARKET APPROACH INCLUDES THE USE OF FINANCIAL

METRICS AND RATIOS OF COMPARABLE PUBLIC COMPANIES, SUCH AS

PROJECTED REVENUES, EARNINGS, AND COMPARABLE PERFORMANCE

MULTIPLES. THE SELECTION OF COMPARABLE COMPANIES REQUIRES

MANAGEMENT JUDGMENT AND IS BASED ON A NUMBER OF FACTORS,

INCLUDING COMPARABLE COMPANIES SIZES, GROWTH RATES,

INDUSTRIES, DEVELOPMENT STAGES, AND OTHER RELEVANT FACTORS. THE

INCOME APPROACH INCLUDES THE USE OF A DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW

MODEL, WHICH MAY INCLUDE ONE OR MULTIPLE DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW

SCENARIOS AND REQUIRES THE FOLLOWING SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES FOR

THE INVESTEE: REVENUE, BASED ON ASSUMED MARKET SEGMENT SIZE AND

ASSUMED MARKET SEGMENT SHARE; EXPENSES, CAPITAL SPENDING, AND

OTHER COSTS; AND DISCOUNT RATES BASED ON THE RISK PROFILE OF

COMPARABLE COMPANIES. ESTIMATES OF MARKET SEGMENT SIZE, MARKET

SEGMENT SHARE, EXPENSES, CAPITAL SPENDING, AND OTHER COSTS ARE

DEVELOPED BY THE INVESTEE

AND/OR

INTEL

USING HISTORICAL DATA AND AVAILABLE MARKET DATA. THE VALUATION

OF OUR NON-MARKETABLE EQUITY INVESTMENTS ALSO TAKES INTO ACCOUNT

VARIABLES SUCH AS CONDITIONS REFLECTED IN THE CAPITAL MARKETS,

RECENT FINANCING ACTIVITIES BY THE INVESTEES, THE

INVESTEES CAPITAL STRUCTURE, AND THE TERMS OF THE

INVESTEES ISSUED INTERESTS.

FOR NON-MARKETABLE EQUITY INVESTMENTS, THE MEASUREMENT OF FAIR

VALUE REQUIRES SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT AND INCLUDES QUANTITATIVE

AND QUALITATIVE ANALYSIS OF IDENTIFIED EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES

THAT IMPACT THE FAIR VALUE OF THE INVESTMENT, SUCH AS.



THE INVESTEES REVENUE AND EARNINGS TRENDS RELATIVE TO

PRE-DEFINED MILESTONES AND OVERALL BUSINESS PROSPECTS;



THE TECHNOLOGICAL FEASIBILITY OF THE INVESTEES PRODUCTS

AND TECHNOLOGIES;



THE GENERAL MARKET CONDITIONS IN THE INVESTEES INDUSTRY OR

GEOGRAPHIC AREA, INCLUDING ADVERSE REGULATORY OR ECONOMIC

CHANGES;



FACTORS RELATED TO THE INVESTEES ABILITY TO REMAIN IN

BUSINESS, SUCH AS THE INVESTEES LIQUIDITY, DEBT RATIOS,

AND THE RATE AT WHICH THE INVESTEE IS USING ITS CASH; AND



THE INVESTEES RECEIPT OF ADDITIONAL FUNDING AT A LOWER

VALUATION.

IF THE FAIR VALUE OF AN INVESTMENT IS BELOW OUR CARRYING VALUE,

WE DETERMINE IF THE INVESTMENT IS OTHER THAN TEMPORARILY

IMPAIRED BASED ON OUR QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE ANALYSIS,

WHICH INCLUDES ASSESSING THE SEVERITY AND DURATION OF THE

IMPAIRMENT AND THE LIKELIHOOD OF RECOVERY BEFORE DISPOSAL. IF

THE INVESTMENT IS CONSIDERED TO BE OTHER THAN TEMPORARILY

IMPAIRED, WE WRITE DOWN THE INVESTMENT TO ITS FAIR VALUE.

IMPAIRMENTS OF NON-MARKETABLE EQUITY INVESTMENTS WERE $125

MILLION IN 2010. OVER THE PAST 12 QUARTERS, INCLUDING THE FOURTH

QUARTER OF 2010, IMPAIRMENTS OF NON-MARKETABLE EQUITY

INVESTMENTS RANGED FROM $11 MILLION TO $896 MILLION PER QUARTER.

THIS RANGE INCLUDED IMPAIRMENTS OF $896 MILLION DURING THE

FOURTH QUARTER OF 2008, PRIMARILY RELATED TO A $762 MILLION

IMPAIRMENT CHARGE ON OUR INVESTMENT IN CLEARWIRE COMMUNICATIONS,

LLC (CLEARWIRE LLC).

IMFT/IMFS

IMFT AND IMFS ARE VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES THAT ARE DESIGNED

TO MANUFACTURE AND SELL NAND PRODUCTS TO INTEL AND MICRON AT

MANUFACTURING COST. WE DETERMINE THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR

INVESTMENT IN IMFT/IMFS USING THE INCOME APPROACH BASED ON A

WEIGHTED AVERAGE OF MULTIPLE DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW SCENARIOS OF

OUR NAND SOLUTIONS GROUP BUSINESS, WHICH REQUIRES THE USE OF

UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS. UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS THAT REQUIRE US TO MAKE

OUR MOST DIFFICULT AND SUBJECTIVE JUDGMENTS ARE THE ESTIMATES

FOR PROJECTED REVENUE AND DISCOUNT RATE. CHANGES IN MANAGEMENT

ESTIMATES FOR THESE UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS HAVE THE MOST

SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON THE FAIR VALUE DETERMINATION. WE HAVE NOT

HAD AN

OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY

IMPAIRMENT OF OUR INVESTMENT IN IMFT/IMFS.

LONG-LIVED

ASSETS

WE ASSESS THE IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS WHEN EVENTS OR

CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THAT THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE

ASSETS OR THE ASSET GROUPING MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE. FACTORS

THAT WE CONSIDER IN DECIDING WHEN TO PERFORM AN IMPAIRMENT

REVIEW INCLUDE SIGNIFICANT UNDER-PERFORMANCE OF A BUSINESS OR

PRODUCT LINE IN RELATION TO EXPECTATIONS, SIGNIFICANT NEGATIVE

INDUSTRY OR ECONOMIC TRENDS, AND SIGNIFICANT CHANGES OR PLANNED

CHANGES IN OUR USE OF THE ASSETS. WE MEASURE THE RECOVERABILITY

OF ASSETS THAT WILL CONTINUE TO BE USED IN OUR OPERATIONS BY

COMPARING THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE ASSET GROUPING TO OUR

ESTIMATE OF THE RELATED TOTAL FUTURE UNDISCOUNTED NET CASH

FLOWS. IF AN ASSET GROUPINGS CARRYING VALUE IS NOT

RECOVERABLE THROUGH THE RELATED UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS, THE

ASSET GROUPING IS CONSIDERED TO BE IMPAIRED. THE IMPAIRMENT IS

MEASURED BY COMPARING THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE ASSET

GROUPINGS CARRYING VALUE AND ITS FAIR VALUE. LONG-LIVED

ASSETS SUCH AS GOODWILL; INTANGIBLE ASSETS; AND PROPERTY, PLANT

AND EQUIPMENT ARE CONSIDERED NON-FINANCIAL ASSETS, AND ARE

RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE ONLY IF AN IMPAIRMENT CHARGE IS

RECOGNIZED.

IMPAIRMENTS OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS ARE DETERMINED FOR GROUPS OF

ASSETS RELATED TO THE LOWEST LEVEL OF IDENTIFIABLE INDEPENDENT

CASH FLOWS. DUE TO OUR ASSET USAGE MODEL AND THE INTERCHANGEABLE

NATURE OF OUR SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING CAPACITY, WE MUST MAKE

SUBJECTIVE JUDGMENTS IN DETERMINING THE INDEPENDENT CASH FLOWS

THAT CAN BE RELATED TO SPECIFIC ASSET GROUPINGS. IN ADDITION, AS

WE MAKE MANUFACTURING PROCESS CONVERSIONS AND OTHER FACTORY

PLANNING DECISIONS, WE MUST MAKE SUBJECTIVE JUDGMENTS REGARDING

THE REMAINING USEFUL LIVES OF ASSETS, PRIMARILY PROCESS-SPECIFIC

SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING TOOLS AND BUILDING IMPROVEMENTS.

WHEN WE DETERMINE THAT THE USEFUL LIVES OF ASSETS ARE SHORTER

THAN WE HAD ORIGINALLY ESTIMATED, WE ACCELERATE THE RATE OF

DEPRECIATION OVER THE ASSETS NEW, SHORTER USEFUL LIVES.

OVER THE PAST 12 QUARTERS, INCLUDING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2010,

IMPAIRMENTS AND ACCELERATED DEPRECIATION OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS

RANGED FROM $10 MILLION TO $300 MILLION PER QUARTER.

INCOME

TAXES

WE MUST MAKE ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS IN DETERMINING THE

PROVISION FOR TAXES FOR FINANCIAL STATEMENT PURPOSES. THESE

ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS OCCUR IN THE CALCULATION OF TAX CREDITS,

BENEFITS, AND DEDUCTIONS, AND IN THE CALCULATION OF CERTAIN TAX

ASSETS AND LIABILITIES THAT ARISE FROM DIFFERENCES IN THE TIMING

OF RECOGNITION OF REVENUE AND EXPENSE FOR TAX AND FINANCIAL

STATEMENT PURPOSES, AS WELL AS THE INTEREST AND PENALTIES

RELATED TO UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS. SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN THESE

ESTIMATES MAY RESULT IN AN INCREASE OR DECREASE TO OUR TAX

PROVISION IN A SUBSEQUENT PERIOD.

WE MUST ASSESS THE LIKELIHOOD THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO RECOVER

OUR DEFERRED TAX ASSETS. IF RECOVERY IS NOT LIKELY, WE MUST

INCREASE OUR PROVISION FOR TAXES BY RECORDING A VALUATION

ALLOWANCE AGAINST THE DEFERRED TAX ASSETS THAT WE ESTIMATE WILL

NOT ULTIMATELY BE RECOVERABLE. WE BELIEVE THAT WE WILL

ULTIMATELY RECOVER THE DEFERRED TAX ASSETS RECORDED ON OUR

CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS. HOWEVER, SHOULD THERE BE A CHANGE

IN OUR ABILITY TO RECOVER OUR DEFERRED TAX ASSETS, OUR TAX

PROVISION WOULD INCREASE IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH WE DETERMINED

THAT THE RECOVERY WAS NOT LIKELY. RECOVERY OF A PORTION OF OUR

DEFERRED TAX ASSETS IS IMPACTED BY MANAGEMENTS PLANS WITH

RESPECT TO HOLDING OR DISPOSING OF CERTAIN INVESTMENTS;

THEREFORE, CHANGES IN MANAGEMENTS PLANS WITH RESPECT TO

HOLDING OR DISPOSING OF INVESTMENTS COULD AFFECT OUR FUTURE

PROVISION FOR TAXES.

THE CALCULATION OF OUR TAX LIABILITIES INVOLVES DEALING WITH

UNCERTAINTIES IN THE APPLICATION OF COMPLEX TAX REGULATIONS. WE

RECOGNIZE LIABILITIES FOR UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS BASED ON A

TWO-STEP PROCESS. THE FIRST STEP IS TO EVALUATE THE TAX POSITION

FOR RECOGNITION BY DETERMINING IF THE WEIGHT OF AVAILABLE

EVIDENCE INDICATES THAT IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT THE

POSITION WILL BE SUSTAINED ON AUDIT, INCLUDING RESOLUTION OF

RELATED APPEALS OR LITIGATION PROCESSES, IF ANY. IF WE DETERMINE

THAT A TAX POSITION WILL MORE LIKELY THAN NOT BE SUSTAINED ON

AUDIT, THE SECOND STEP REQUIRES US TO ESTIMATE AND MEASURE THE

TAX BENEFIT AS THE LARGEST AMOUNT THAT IS MORE THAN 50% LIKELY

TO BE REALIZED UPON ULTIMATE SETTLEMENT. IT IS INHERENTLY

DIFFICULT AND SUBJECTIVE TO ESTIMATE SUCH AMOUNTS, AS WE HAVE TO

DETERMINE THE PROBABILITY OF VARIOUS POSSIBLE OUTCOMES. WE

RE-EVALUATE THESE UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS ON A QUARTERLY BASIS.

THIS EVALUATION IS BASED ON FACTORS SUCH AS CHANGES IN FACTS OR

CIRCUMSTANCES, CHANGES IN TAX LAW, NEW AUDIT ACTIVITY, AND

EFFECTIVELY SETTLED ISSUES. DETERMINING WHETHER AN UNCERTAIN TAX

POSITION IS EFFECTIVELY SETTLED REQUIRES JUDGMENT. SUCH A CHANGE

IN RECOGNITION OR MEASUREMENT WOULD RESULT IN THE RECOGNITION OF

A TAX BENEFIT OR AN ADDITIONAL CHARGE TO THE TAX PROVISION.

INVENTORY

THE VALUATION OF INVENTORY REQUIRES US TO ESTIMATE OBSOLETE OR

EXCESS INVENTORY AS WELL AS INVENTORY THAT IS NOT OF SALEABLE

QUALITY. THE DETERMINATION OF OBSOLETE OR EXCESS INVENTORY

REQUIRES US TO ESTIMATE THE FUTURE DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS. THE

ESTIMATE OF FUTURE DEMAND IS COMPARED TO

WORK-IN-PROCESS

AND FINISHED GOODS INVENTORY LEVELS TO DETERMINE THE AMOUNT, IF

ANY, OF OBSOLETE OR EXCESS INVENTORY. AS OF DECEMBER 25, 2010,

WE HAD TOTAL

WORK-IN-PROCESS

INVENTORY OF $1.9 BILLION AND TOTAL FINISHED GOODS INVENTORY OF

$1.4 BILLION. THE DEMAND FORECAST IS INCLUDED IN THE DEVELOPMENT

OF OUR SHORT-TERM MANUFACTURING PLANS TO ENABLE CONSISTENCY

BETWEEN INVENTORY VALUATION AND BUILD DECISIONS.

PRODUCT-SPECIFIC FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES REVIEWED IN THE

INVENTORY VALUATION PROCESS INCLUDE A REVIEW OF THE CUSTOMER

BASE, THE STAGE OF THE PRODUCT LIFE CYCLE OF OUR PRODUCTS,

CONSUMER CONFIDENCE, AND CUSTOMER ACCEPTANCE OF OUR PRODUCTS, AS

WELL AS AN ASSESSMENT OF THE SELLING PRICE IN RELATION TO THE

PRODUCT COST. IF OUR DEMAND FORECAST FOR SPECIFIC PRODUCTS IS

GREATER THAN ACTUAL DEMAND AND WE FAIL TO REDUCE MANUFACTURING

OUTPUT ACCORDINGLY, WE COULD BE REQUIRED TO WRITE OFF INVENTORY,

WHICH WOULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR GROSS MARGIN.

IN ORDER TO DETERMINE WHAT COSTS CAN BE INCLUDED IN THE

VALUATION OF INVENTORY, WE MUST DETERMINE NORMAL CAPACITY AT OUR

MANUFACTURING AND ASSEMBLY AND TEST FACILITIES, BASED ON

HISTORICAL LOADINGS COMPARED TO TOTAL AVAILABLE CAPACITY. IF THE

FACTORY LOADINGS ARE BELOW THE ESTABLISHED NORMAL CAPACITY

LEVEL, A PORTION OF OUR MANUFACTURING OVERHEAD COSTS WOULD NOT

BE INCLUDED IN THE COST OF INVENTORY, AND THEREFORE WOULD BE

RECOGNIZED AS COST OF SALES IN THAT PERIOD, WHICH WOULD

NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR GROSS MARGIN. WE REFER TO THESE COSTS AS

EXCESS CAPACITY CHARGES. OVER THE PAST 12 QUARTERS, EXCESS

CAPACITY CHARGES RANGED FROM ZERO TO $680 MILLION PER QUARTER.

LOSS

CONTINGENCIES

WE ARE SUBJECT TO VARIOUS LEGAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDINGS

AND ASSERTED AND POTENTIAL CLAIMS, ACCRUALS RELATED TO REPAIR OR

REPLACEMENT OF PARTS IN CONNECTION WITH PRODUCT ERRATA, AS WELL

AS PRODUCT WARRANTIES AND POTENTIAL ASSET IMPAIRMENTS (LOSS

CONTINGENCIES) THAT ARISE IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS. AN

ESTIMATED LOSS FROM SUCH CONTINGENCIES IS RECOGNIZED AS A CHARGE

TO INCOME IF IT IS PROBABLE THAT A LIABILITY HAS BEEN INCURRED

AND THE AMOUNT OF THE LOSS CAN BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED.

DISCLOSURE OF A LOSS CONTINGENCY IS REQUIRED IF THERE IS AT

LEAST A REASONABLE POSSIBILITY THAT A LOSS HAS BEEN INCURRED.

THE OUTCOMES OF LEGAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDINGS AND CLAIMS,

AND THE ESTIMATION OF PRODUCT WARRANTIES AND ASSET IMPAIRMENTS,

ARE SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT UNCERTAINTY. SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT IS

REQUIRED IN BOTH THE DETERMINATION OF PROBABILITY AND THE

DETERMINATION AS TO WHETHER A LOSS IS REASONABLY ESTIMABLE. WITH

RESPECT TO ESTIMATING THE LOSSES ASSOCIATED WITH REPAIRING AND

REPLACING PARTS IN CONNECTION WITH PRODUCT ERRATA, WE MAKE

JUDGMENTS WITH RESPECT TO CUSTOMER RETURN RATES, COSTS TO REPAIR

OR REPLACE PARTS, AND WHERE THE PRODUCT IS IN OUR

CUSTOMERS MANUFACTURING PROCESS. AT LEAST QUARTERLY, WE

REVIEW THE STATUS OF EACH SIGNIFICANT MATTER, AND WE MAY REVISE

OUR ESTIMATES. THESE REVISIONS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON

OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL POSITION.

BREAKDOWN OF REVENUE

OUR NET REVENUE FOR 2010 INCREASED $8.5 BILLION, OR 24%,

COMPARED TO 2009. THE INCREASE WAS DUE TO HIGHER MICROPROCESSOR

AND CHIPSET UNIT SALES, AS WELL AS HIGHER MICROPROCESSOR AVERAGE

SELLING PRICES. REVENUE IN THE JAPAN, ASIA-PACIFIC, AMERICAS,

AND EUROPE REGIONS INCREASED BY 31%, 29%, 21%, AND 6%,

RESPECTIVELY, COMPARED TO 2009.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

MANAGEMENTS

DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)

OUR OVERALL GROSS MARGIN DOLLARS FOR 2010 INCREASED $8.9

BILLION, OR 46%, COMPARED TO 2009. THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY

DUE TO SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER REVENUE. TO A LESSER EXTENT, EXCESS

CAPACITY CHARGES RECORDED IN 2009 OF $1.1 BILLION AND LOWER

PLATFORM (MICROPROCESSOR AND CHIPSET) UNIT COST CONTRIBUTED TO

THE INCREASE IN GROSS MARGIN DOLLARS FOR 2010 COMPARED TO 2009.

THESE INCREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY CHARGES RECORDED IN THE

FOURTH QUARTER OF 2010 TO REPAIR AND REPLACE MATERIALS AND

SYSTEMS IMPACTED BY A DESIGN ISSUE RELATED TO OUR

INTEL

®

6 SERIES EXPRESS CHIPSET FAMILY. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION, SEE

NOTE 20: CHIPSET DESIGN ISSUE IN PART II, ITEM 8 OF

THIS FORM

10-K.

OUR OVERALL GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE INCREASED TO 65.3% IN 2010

FROM 55.7% IN 2009. THE INCREASE IN GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE WAS

PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE INCREASE

IN THE PC CLIENT GROUP OPERATING SEGMENT AND, TO A LESSER

EXTENT, GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE INCREASES IN THE DATA CENTER

GROUP AND NAND SOLUTIONS GROUP OPERATING SEGMENTS. WE DERIVED A

SUBSTANTIAL MAJORITY OF OUR OVERALL GROSS MARGIN DOLLARS IN 2010

AND 2009 FROM THE SALE OF MICROPROCESSORS IN THE PC CLIENT GROUP

AND DATA CENTER GROUP OPERATING SEGMENTS. SEE BUSINESS

OUTLOOK FOR A DISCUSSION OF GROSS MARGIN EXPECTATIONS.

OUR NET REVENUE FOR 2009 DECREASED 7% COMPARED TO 2008. AVERAGE

SELLING PRICES FOR MICROPROCESSORS AND CHIPSETS DECREASED AND

MICROPROCESSOR AND CHIPSET UNIT SALES INCREASED, COMPARED TO

2008, PRIMARILY DUE TO THE RAMP OF INTEL ATOM PROCESSORS AND

CHIPSETS, WHICH GENERALLY HAVE LOWER AVERAGE SELLING PRICES THAN

OUR OTHER MICROPROCESSOR AND CHIPSET PRODUCTS. REVENUE FROM THE

SALE OF NOR FLASH MEMORY PRODUCTS AND COMMUNICATIONS PRODUCTS

DECLINED $740 MILLION, PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF BUSINESS

DIVESTITURES. ADDITIONALLY, AN INCREASE IN REVENUE FROM THE SALE

OF NAND FLASH MEMORY PRODUCTS WAS MOSTLY OFFSET BY A DECREASE IN

REVENUE FROM THE SALE OF WIRELESS CONNECTIVITY PRODUCTS. REVENUE

IN THE ASIA-PACIFIC REGION INCREASED 2% COMPARED TO 2008, WHILE

REVENUE IN THE EUROPE, JAPAN, AND AMERICAS REGIONS DECREASED BY

26%, 15%, AND 4%, RESPECTIVELY, COMPARED TO 2008.

OUR OVERALL GROSS MARGIN DOLLARS FOR 2009 DECREASED $1.3

BILLION, OR 6%, COMPARED TO 2008. THE DECREASE WAS DUE TO LOWER

REVENUE, APPROXIMATELY $830 MILLION OF HIGHER FACTORY

UNDERUTILIZATION CHARGES, AND APPROXIMATELY $330 MILLION OF

HIGHER

START-UP

COSTS. THESE DECREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER PLATFORM

UNIT COST AND LOWER NAND FLASH MEMORY UNIT COST. OUR OVERALL

GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE INCREASED SLIGHTLY TO 55.7% IN 2009 FROM

55.5% IN 2008. THE SLIGHT INCREASE IN GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE

WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE

INCREASES IN THE NAND SOLUTIONS GROUP AND DATA CENTER GROUP

OPERATING SEGMENTS, OFFSET BY THE GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE

DECREASE IN THE PC CLIENT GROUP OPERATING SEGMENT. WE DERIVED A

SUBSTANTIAL MAJORITY OF OUR OVERALL GROSS MARGIN DOLLARS IN

2009, AND MOST OF OUR OVERALL GROSS MARGIN DOLLARS IN 2008, FROM

THE SALES OF MICROPROCESSORS IN THE PC CLIENT GROUP AND DATA

CENTER GROUP OPERATING SEGMENTS.

CHIPSETS WITHIN PCCG INCLUDE THOSE DESIGNED FOR THE NOTEBOOK,

NETBOOK, AND DESKTOP COMPUTING MARKET SEGMENTS. SIGNIFICANTLY

HIGHER NOTEBOOK UNIT SALES WERE THE PRIMARY DRIVER FOR THE

INCREASE IN MICROPROCESSOR REVENUE. TO A LESSER EXTENT, HIGHER

NOTEBOOK AVERAGE SELLING PRICES AND HIGHER DESKTOP UNIT SALES

ALSO CONTRIBUTED TO THE INCREASE. THE INCREASE IN CHIPSET,

MOTHERBOARD, AND OTHER REVENUE WAS DUE TO SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER

CHIPSET UNIT SALES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER

REVENUE FROM THE SALE OF WIRELESS CONNECTIVITY PRODUCTS.

OPERATING INCOME INCREASED BY $5.7 BILLION IN 2010 COMPARED TO

2009. THE INCREASE IN OPERATING INCOME WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO

SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER REVENUE. DURING 2009, PCCG RECOGNIZED

APPROXIMATELY $1.0 BILLION OF EXCESS CAPACITY CHARGES, PRIMARILY

RELATED TO MICROPROCESSORS AND CHIPSETS. ADDITIONALLY, LOWER

PLATFORM UNIT COST IN 2010 CONTRIBUTED TO THE INCREASE IN

OPERATING INCOME. THESE IMPACTS WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY CHARGES

RECORDED IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2010 TO REPAIR AND REPLACE

FOR 2009, NET REVENUE FOR THE PCCG OPERATING SEGMENT DECREASED

BY $1.8 BILLION, OR 6%, COMPARED TO 2008. THE DECREASE IN

MICROPROCESSOR REVENUE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER NOTEBOOK

MICROPROCESSOR AVERAGE SELLING PRICES, AND LOWER DESKTOP

MICROPROCESSOR UNIT SALES AND AVERAGE SELLING PRICES. THESE

DECREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN

NETBOOK MICROPROCESSOR UNIT SALES DUE TO THE RAMP OF INTEL ATOM

PROCESSORS. THE DECREASE IN CHIPSET, MOTHERBOARD, AND OTHER

REVENUE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER CHIPSET AVERAGE SELLING

PRICES AND LOWER UNIT SALES OF WIRELESS CONNECTIVITY PRODUCTS,

PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER CHIPSET UNIT SALES.

OPERATING INCOME DECREASED BY $1.8 BILLION, OR 19%, IN 2009

COMPARED TO 2008. THE DECREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER

20%, IN 2010 COMPARED TO 2009, AND INCREASED $2.5 BILLION, OR

45%, IN 2009 COMPARED TO 2008. THE DECREASE IN 2010 WAS DUE TO

THE 2009 CHARGE OF $1.447 BILLION INCURRED AS A RESULT OF THE

FINE IMPOSED BY THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION (EC) AND THE $1.25

BILLION PAYMENT TO AMD IN 2009 AS PART OF A SETTLEMENT

AGREEMENT. THESE DECREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER

ADVERTISING EXPENSES (INCLUDING COOPERATIVE ADVERTISING

EXPENSES), HIGHER PROFIT-DEPENDENT COMPENSATION, AND, TO A

LESSER EXTENT, EXPENSES RELATED TO OUR WIND RIVER SOFTWARE GROUP

OPERATING SEGMENT AND AN EXPENSE OF $100 MILLION RECOGNIZED

DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2010 DUE TO A PATENT CROSS-LICENSE

AGREEMENT THAT WE ENTERED INTO WITH NVIDIA IN JANUARY 2011 (SEE

NOTE 29: CONTINGENCIES IN PART II, ITEM 8 OF THIS

FORM

10-K).

THE INCREASE IN 2009 COMPARED TO 2008 WAS DUE TO THE 2009 CHARGE

INCURRED AS A RESULT OF THE FINE IMPOSED BY THE EC AND THE

PAYMENT TO AMD IN 2009 AS PART OF A SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT. TO A

LESSER EXTENT, WE HAD HIGHER PROFIT-DEPENDENT COMPENSATION

EXPENSES THAT WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER ADVERTISING

EXPENSES (INCLUDING COOPERATIVE ADVERTISING EXPENSES).

R&D, COMBINED WITH MARKETING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE

EXPENSES, WERE 30% OF NET REVENUE IN 2010, 39% OF NET REVENUE IN

UNDER THE 2009 RESTRUCTURING PROGRAM, WE INCURRED $208 MILLION

OF CHARGES RELATED TO EMPLOYEE SEVERANCE AND BENEFIT

ARRANGEMENTS FOR APPROXIMATELY 6,500 EMPLOYEES. MOST OF THESE

EMPLOYEE ACTIONS OCCURRED WITHIN MANUFACTURING.

WE ESTIMATE THAT THESE EMPLOYEE SEVERANCE AND BENEFIT CHARGES

RESULT IN GROSS ANNUAL SAVINGS OF APPROXIMATELY $290 MILLION. WE

ARE REALIZING A SUBSTANTIAL MAJORITY OF THESE SAVINGS WITHIN

COST OF SALES.

2008 NAND

PLAN

IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2008, MANAGEMENT APPROVED A PLAN WITH

MICRON TO DISCONTINUE THE SUPPLY OF NAND FLASH MEMORY FROM THE

200MM FACILITY WITHIN THE IMFT MANUFACTURING NETWORK. THE

AGREEMENT RESULTED IN A $215 MILLION RESTRUCTURING CHARGE,

PRIMARILY RELATED TO THE IMFT 200MM SUPPLY AGREEMENT. THE

RESTRUCTURING CHARGE RESULTED IN A REDUCTION OF OUR INVESTMENT

IN IMFT/IMFS OF $184 MILLION, A CASH PAYMENT TO MICRON OF $24

MILLION, AND OTHER CASH PAYMENTS OF $7 MILLION. THE 2008 NAND

PLAN WAS COMPLETED AT THE END OF 2008.

DURING 2006, AS PART OF OUR ASSESSMENT OF OUR WORLDWIDE

MANUFACTURING CAPACITY OPERATIONS, WE PLACED FOR SALE OUR

FABRICATION FACILITY IN COLORADO SPRINGS, COLORADO. AS A RESULT

OF PLACING THE FACILITY FOR SALE, IN 2006 WE RECORDED A $214

MILLION IMPAIRMENT CHARGE TO WRITE DOWN TO FAIR VALUE THE LAND,

BUILDING, AND EQUIPMENT. WE INCURRED $54 MILLION IN ADDITIONAL

ASSET IMPAIRMENT CHARGES AS A RESULT OF MARKET CONDITIONS

RELATED TO THE COLORADO SPRINGS FACILITY DURING 2007 AND

ADDITIONAL CHARGES IN 2008. WE SOLD THE COLORADO SPRINGS

FACILITY IN 2009.

WE INCURRED $85 MILLION IN ASSET IMPAIRMENT CHARGES RELATED TO

ASSETS THAT WE SOLD IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE DIVESTITURE OF OUR

NOR FLASH MEMORY BUSINESS IN 2007 AND AN ADDITIONAL $275 MILLION

IN 2008. WE DETERMINED THE IMPAIRMENT CHARGES BASED ON THE FAIR

VALUE, LESS SELLING COSTS, THAT WE EXPECTED TO RECEIVE UPON

COMPLETION OF THE DIVESTITURE IN 2007, AND DETERMINED THE

IMPAIRMENT CHARGES BASED ON THE REVISED FAIR VALUE OF THE EQUITY

AND NOTE RECEIVABLE THAT WE RECEIVED UPON COMPLETION OF THE

UNEXPECTED LIABILITIES. IN ADDITION, AS WE INTEGRATE THESE

BUSINESSES INTO OUR OPERATIONS, OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE

FINANCIAL AND OPERATIONAL PERFORMANCE OF THE ACQUIRED BUSINESSES

MAY CHANGE, WHICH COULD REQUIRE AN UPDATE TO OUR BUSINESS

OUTLOOK.

OUR BUSINESS OUTLOOK CONTAINS FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS AND

PROJECTIONS BASED UPON ESTIMATES OF THE IMPACT OF THE CHIPSET

DESIGN ISSUE RELATED TO OUR INTEL 6 SERIES EXPRESS CHIPSET

FAMILY (SEE NOTE 20: CHIPSET DESIGN ISSUE IN PART

II, ITEM 8 OF THIS FORM

10-K)

ON OUR

FUTURE FINANCIAL AND OPERATING RESULTS, INCLUDING ON REVENUE,

GROSS MARGIN, AND INVENTORY VALUATION, BASED ON OUR PRELIMINARY

ANALYSIS. AMONG THE FACTORS RELATED TO THE CHIPSET DESIGN ISSUE

THAT COULD CAUSE ACTUAL RESULTS TO DIFFER ARE THE NUMBER OF

UNITS THAT MAY BE AFFECTED, THE IMPACT ON SYSTEMS IN THE MARKET,

THE COSTS THAT WE MAY INCUR IN REPAIRING OR REPLACING IMPACTED

COMPONENTS, THE EXTENT TO WHICH CUSTOMERS PURCHASE PARTS FROM

OUR COMPETITORS AS A RESULT OF OUR PARTS SHORTAGES OR OTHERWISE,

THE EXTENT OF SHIPMENTS OF IMPACTED CHIPSETS FOR USE IN PC

SYSTEM CONFIGURATIONS THAT WOULD NOT BE IMPACTED BY THE DESIGN

ISSUE, AND THE EXTENT TO WHICH WE ARE ABLE TO INCREASE

PRODUCTION OF SUBSTITUTE OR REDESIGNED PARTS FOR CUSTOMERS.

IN ADDITION TO THE VARIOUS IMPORTANT FACTORS DISCUSSED ABOVE, A

NUMBER OF OTHER IMPORTANT FACTORS COULD CAUSE ACTUAL RESULTS TO

DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM OUR EXPECTATIONS. SEE RISK

FACTORS IN PART I, ITEM 1A OF THIS

FORM 10-K.

OUR EXPECTATIONS FOR 2011 ARE AS FOLLOWS.



REVENUE.

WE EXPECT A 2011 REVENUE GROWTH PERCENTAGE

IN THE MID- TO HIGH-TEENS.



GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE.

63%, PLUS OR MINUS A FEW

PERCENTAGE POINTS. THE 63% MIDPOINT IS LOWER COMPARED TO OUR

2010 GROSS MARGIN OF 65.3%, PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER

MANUFACTURING PERIOD COSTS, MOSTLY

START-UP

COSTS, AS WELL AS THE IMPACTS OF THE RECENTLY COMPLETED

ACQUISITION OF THE WLS BUSINESS OF INFINEON AND THE EXPECTED

ACQUISITION OF MCAFEE IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2011. WE EXPECT

THESE DECREASES TO BE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER PLATFORM UNIT

COST AND HIGHER PLATFORM REVENUE.



TOTAL SPENDING.

WE EXPECT SPENDING ON R&D, PLUS

MARKETING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES, IN 2011 TO BE

APPROXIMATELY $15.7 BILLION, PLUS OR MINUS $200 MILLION,

COMPARED TO $12.9 BILLION IN 2010.



RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT SPENDING.

APPROXIMATELY

$8.2 BILLION COMPARED TO $6.6 BILLION IN 2010 AS WE CONTINUE TO

RAMP OUR NEW 22NM PROCESS TECHNOLOGY.



CAPITAL SPENDING.

$9.0 BILLION, PLUS OR MINUS $300

MILLION, COMPARED TO $5.2 BILLION IN 2010. WE EXPECT CAPITAL

SPENDING FOR 2011 TO PRIMARILY CONSIST OF INVESTMENTS IN 22NM

PROCESS TECHNOLOGY.



DEPRECIATION.

APPROXIMATELY $5.0 BILLION, PLUS OR

MINUS $100 MILLION, COMPARED TO $4.4 BILLION IN 2010.



TAX RATE.

APPROXIMATELY 29%, FLAT COMPARED TO 29% IN

2010. THE ESTIMATED EFFECTIVE TAX RATE IS BASED ON TAX LAW IN

EFFECT AS OF DECEMBER 25, 2010 AND EXPECTED INCOME.

STATUS OF

DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)

OPERATING

ACTIVITIES

CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES IS NET INCOME ADJUSTED FOR

CERTAIN NON-CASH ITEMS AND CHANGES IN CERTAIN ASSETS AND

LIABILITIES.

FOR 2010 COMPARED TO 2009, THE $5.5 BILLION INCREASE IN CASH

PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES WAS DUE TO HIGHER NET INCOME,

PARTIALLY OFFSET BY ADJUSTMENTS FOR NON-CASH ITEMS. INCOME TAXES

PAID, NET OF REFUNDS, IN 2010 COMPARED TO 2009 WERE $3.7 BILLION

HIGHER, PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER INCOME BEFORE TAXES IN 2010.

CHANGES IN ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AS OF DECEMBER 25, 2010

COMPARED TO DECEMBER 26, 2009 INCLUDED THE FOLLOWING.



INVENTORIES

INCREASED DUE TO HIGHER MICROPROCESSOR

INVENTORY, PRIMARILY DUE TO RAMPING NEW PRODUCTS.



ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE

INCREASED DUE TO A HIGHER PROPORTION

OF SALES AT THE END OF THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2010.



ACCOUNTS PAYABLE

INCREASED DUE TO TIMING OF PAYMENTS.

FOR 2010 AND 2009, OUR TWO LARGEST CUSTOMERS ACCOUNTED FOR 38%

OF OUR NET REVENUE, WITH ONE OF THESE CUSTOMERS ACCOUNTING FOR

21% OF OUR NET REVENUE IN 2010 AND 2009, AND ANOTHER CUSTOMER

ACCOUNTING FOR 17% OF OUR NET REVENUE IN 2010 AND 2009. THESE

TWO LARGEST CUSTOMERS ACCOUNTED FOR 44% OF OUR ACCOUNTS

RECEIVABLE AS OF DECEMBER 25, 2010 (41% AS OF DECEMBER 26, 2009).

FOR 2009 COMPARED TO 2008, THE $244 MILLION INCREASE IN CASH

PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO CHANGES IN

ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER NET INCOME.

INCOME TAXES PAID, NET OF REFUNDS, IN 2009 COMPARED TO 2008 WERE

$3.1 BILLION LOWER, PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER INCOME BEFORE TAXES

AND TIMING OF PAYMENTS.

INVESTING

ACTIVITIES

INVESTING CASH FLOWS CONSIST PRIMARILY OF CAPITAL EXPENDITURES,

NET INVESTMENT PURCHASES, MATURITIES, DISPOSALS, AND CASH USED

FOR ACQUISITIONS.

THE INCREASE IN CASH USED FOR INVESTING ACTIVITIES IN 2010

COMPARED TO 2009 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO AN INCREASE IN NET

PURCHASES OF

AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE

INVESTMENTS AND, TO A LESSER EXTENT, HIGHER CAPITAL EXPENDITURES

($5.2 BILLION IN 2010 AND $4.5 BILLION IN 2009). THESE INCREASES

WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECREASE IN NET PURCHASES OF TRADING

ASSETS AND LOWER CASH PAID FOR ACQUISITIONS.

THE INCREASE IN CASH USED FOR INVESTING ACTIVITIES IN 2009

COMPARED TO 2008 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO AN INCREASE IN NET

PURCHASES OF

AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE

INVESTMENTS AND TRADING ASSETS, AND HIGHER CASH PAID FOR

ACQUISITIONS. THESE INCREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A

DECREASE IN INVESTMENTS IN NON-MARKETABLE EQUITY INVESTMENTS.

OUR INVESTMENTS IN NON-MARKETABLE EQUITY INVESTMENTS IN 2008

INCLUDED $1.0 BILLION FOR AN OWNERSHIP INTEREST IN CLEARWIRE LLC.

FINANCING

ACTIVITIES

FINANCING CASH FLOWS CONSIST PRIMARILY OF REPURCHASES OF COMMON

STOCK, PAYMENT OF DIVIDENDS TO STOCKHOLDERS, ISSUANCE AND

REPAYMENT OF LONG-TERM DEBT, AND PROCEEDS FROM THE SALE OF

SHARES THROUGH EMPLOYEE EQUITY INCENTIVE PLANS.

THE INCREASE IN CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES IN 2010

COMPARED TO 2009 WAS DUE TO THE ISSUANCE OF LONG-TERM DEBT IN

2009. DURING 2010, WE REPURCHASED $1.7 BILLION OF COMMON STOCK

COMPARED TO $1.8 BILLION IN 2009. AS OF DECEMBER 25, 2010, $4.2

BILLION REMAINED AVAILABLE FOR REPURCHASE UNDER THE EXISTING

REPURCHASE AUTHORIZATION OF $25 BILLION. IN JANUARY 2011, OUR

BOARD OF DIRECTORS INCREASED THE REPURCHASE AUTHORIZATION LIMIT

BY $10 BILLION. WE BASE OUR LEVEL OF COMMON STOCK REPURCHASES ON

INTERNAL CASH MANAGEMENT DECISIONS, AND THIS LEVEL MAY

FLUCTUATE. PROCEEDS FROM THE SALE OF SHARES THROUGH EMPLOYEE

EQUITY INCENTIVE PLANS TOTALED $587 MILLION IN 2010 COMPARED TO

$400 MILLION IN 2009. OUR TOTAL DIVIDEND PAYMENTS WERE $3.5

BILLION IN 2010 COMPARED TO $3.1 BILLION IN 2009 AS A RESULT OF

AN INCREASE IN QUARTERLY CASH DIVIDENDS PER COMMON SHARE. WE

HAVE PAID A CASH DIVIDEND IN EACH OF THE PAST 73 QUARTERS. IN

JANUARY 2011, OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS DECLARED A CASH DIVIDEND OF

$0.1812 PER COMMON SHARE FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2011. THE

DIVIDEND IS PAYABLE ON MARCH 1, 2011 TO STOCKHOLDERS OF RECORD

ON FEBRUARY 7, 2011.

THE DECREASE IN CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES IN 2009

COMPARED TO 2008 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO A DECREASE IN REPURCHASES

OF COMMON STOCK AND THE ISSUANCE OF LONG-TERM DEBT, PARTIALLY

OFFSET BY LOWER PROCEEDS FROM SALES OF SHARES THROUGH EMPLOYEE

EQUITY INCENTIVE PLANS. WE USED THE MAJORITY OF THE PROCEEDS

FROM THE 2009 ISSUANCE OF LONG-TERM DEBT TO REPURCHASE COMMON

STOCK.

OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)

LIQUIDITY

CASH GENERATED BY OPERATIONS IS OUR PRIMARY SOURCE OF LIQUIDITY.

AS OF DECEMBER 25, 2010, CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS, MARKETABLE

DEBT INSTRUMENTS INCLUDED IN TRADING ASSETS, AND SHORT-TERM

INVESTMENTS TOTALED $21.5 BILLION. IN ADDITION TO THE $21.5

BILLION, WE HAVE $3.9 BILLION IN LOANS RECEIVABLE AND OTHER

LONG-TERM INVESTMENTS THAT WE INCLUDE WHEN ASSESSING OUR

INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO. IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2011, WE COMPLETED

THE ACQUISITION OF THE WLS BUSINESS OF INFINEON. TOTAL NET CASH

CONSIDERATION FOR THE ACQUISITION IS ESTIMATED AT $1.4 BILLION.

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION, SEE NOTE 15: ACQUISITIONS

IN PART II, ITEM 8 OF THIS FORM

10-K.

SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR INVESTMENTS IN DEBT INSTRUMENTS ARE

WITH A/A2 OR BETTER RATED ISSUERS, AND A SUBSTANTIAL MAJORITY OF

THE ISSUERS ARE RATED AA-/AA3 OR BETTER.

OUR COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAM PROVIDES ANOTHER POTENTIAL SOURCE

OF LIQUIDITY. WE HAVE AN ONGOING AUTHORIZATION FROM OUR BOARD OF

DIRECTORS TO BORROW UP TO $3.0 BILLION, INCLUDING THROUGH THE

ISSUANCE OF COMMERCIAL PAPER. MAXIMUM BORROWINGS UNDER OUR

COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAM DURING 2010 WERE $150 MILLION, ALTHOUGH

NO COMMERCIAL PAPER REMAINED OUTSTANDING AS OF DECEMBER 25,

2010. OUR COMMERCIAL PAPER WAS RATED

A-1+

BY

STANDARD & POORS AND

P-1

BY

MOODYS AS OF DECEMBER 25, 2010. WE ALSO HAVE AN AUTOMATIC

SHELF REGISTRATION STATEMENT ON FILE WITH THE SEC, PURSUANT TO

WHICH WE MAY OFFER AN UNSPECIFIED AMOUNT OF DEBT, EQUITY, AND

OTHER SECURITIES.

WE BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE THE FINANCIAL RESOURCES NEEDED TO MEET

OUR BUSINESS REQUIREMENTS FOR THE NEXT 12 MONTHS, INCLUDING

CAPITAL EXPENDITURES FOR WORLDWIDE MANUFACTURING AND ASSEMBLY

AND TEST; WORKING CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS; AND POTENTIAL DIVIDENDS,

COMMON STOCK REPURCHASES, AND ACQUISITIONS OR STRATEGIC

INVESTMENTS.

FAIR

VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

WHEN DETERMINING FAIR VALUE, WE CONSIDER THE PRINCIPAL OR MOST

ADVANTAGEOUS MARKET IN WHICH WE WOULD TRANSACT, AND WE CONSIDER

ASSUMPTIONS THAT MARKET PARTICIPANTS WOULD USE WHEN PRICING THE

ASSET OR LIABILITY. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION, SEE FAIR

VALUE IN NOTE 2: ACCOUNTING POLICIES IN PART

II, ITEM 8 OF THIS FORM

10-K.

CREDIT RISK IS FACTORED INTO THE VALUATION OF FINANCIAL

INSTRUMENTS THAT WE MEASURE AND RECORD AT FAIR VALUE ON A

RECURRING BASIS. WHEN FAIR VALUE IS DETERMINED USING PRICING

MODELS, SUCH AS A DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW MODEL, THE ISSUERS

CREDIT RISK

AND/OR

INTELS CREDIT RISK IS FACTORED INTO THE CALCULATION OF THE

FAIR VALUE, AS APPROPRIATE.

MARKETABLE

DEBT INSTRUMENTS

AS OF DECEMBER 25, 2010, OUR ASSETS MEASURED AND RECORDED AT

FAIR VALUE ON A RECURRING BASIS INCLUDED $24 BILLION OF

MARKETABLE DEBT INSTRUMENTS. OF THESE INSTRUMENTS, $7 BILLION

WAS CLASSIFIED AS LEVEL 1, $16.7 BILLION AS LEVEL 2, AND $308

MILLION AS LEVEL 3.

OUR BALANCE OF MARKETABLE DEBT INSTRUMENTS THAT ARE MEASURED AND

RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE ON A RECURRING BASIS AND CLASSIFIED AS

LEVEL 1 WAS CLASSIFIED AS SUCH DUE TO THE USE OF OBSERVABLE

MARKET PRICES FOR IDENTICAL SECURITIES THAT ARE TRADED IN ACTIVE

MARKETS. MANAGEMENT JUDGMENT WAS REQUIRED TO DETERMINE THE

LEVELS FOR THE FREQUENCY OF TRANSACTIONS THAT SHOULD BE MET FOR

A MARKET TO BE CONSIDERED ACTIVE. OUR ASSESSMENT OF AN ACTIVE

MARKET FOR OUR MARKETABLE DEBT INSTRUMENTS GENERALLY TAKES INTO

CONSIDERATION THE NUMBER OF DAYS EACH INDIVIDUAL INSTRUMENT

TRADES OVER A SPECIFIED PERIOD.

OF THE $16.7 BILLION BALANCE OF MARKETABLE DEBT INSTRUMENTS

MEASURED AND RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE ON A RECURRING BASIS AND

CLASSIFIED AS LEVEL 2, APPROXIMATELY 45% OF THE BALANCE WAS

CLASSIFIED AS LEVEL 2 DUE TO THE USE OF A DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW

MODEL AND APPROXIMATELY 55% DUE TO THE USE OF NON-BINDING MARKET

CONSENSUS PRICES THAT ARE CORROBORATED WITH OBSERVABLE MARKET

DATA.

OUR MARKETABLE DEBT INSTRUMENTS THAT ARE MEASURED AND RECORDED

AT FAIR VALUE ON A RECURRING BASIS AND CLASSIFIED AS LEVEL 3

WERE CLASSIFIED AS SUCH DUE TO THE LACK OF OBSERVABLE MARKET

DATA TO CORROBORATE EITHER THE NON-BINDING MARKET CONSENSUS

PRICES OR THE NON-BINDING BROKER QUOTES. WHEN OBSERVABLE MARKET

DATA IS NOT AVAILABLE, WE CORROBORATE THE NON-BINDING MARKET

CONSENSUS PRICES AND NON-BINDING BROKER QUOTES USING

UNOBSERVABLE DATA, IF AVAILABLE.

EQUITY

SECURITIES

AS OF DECEMBER 25, 2010, OUR PORTFOLIO OF ASSETS MEASURED AND

RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE ON A RECURRING BASIS INCLUDED $1.4

BILLION OF MARKETABLE EQUITY SECURITIES. OF THESE SECURITIES,

$1.2 BILLION WAS CLASSIFIED AS LEVEL 1 BECAUSE THE VALUATIONS

WERE BASED ON QUOTED PRICES FOR IDENTICAL SECURITIES IN ACTIVE

MARKETS. OUR ASSESSMENT OF AN ACTIVE MARKET FOR OUR MARKETABLE

EQUITY SECURITIES GENERALLY TAKES INTO CONSIDERATION THE NUMBER

OF DAYS THAT EACH INDIVIDUAL EQUITY SECURITY TRADES OVER A

SPECIFIED PERIOD. THE REMAINING MARKETABLE EQUITY SECURITIES OF

$223 MILLION WERE CLASSIFIED AS LEVEL 2 BECAUSE THEIR VALUATIONS

WERE EITHER ADJUSTED FOR SECURITY-SPECIFIC RESTRICTIONS OR BASED

ON QUOTED PRICES FOR IDENTICAL SECURITIES IN LESS ACTIVE MARKETS.

RELATED GOODS OR TAKEN TITLE TO THE PROPERTY.

2

OTHER PURCHASE OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS INCLUDE PAYMENTS

DUE UNDER VARIOUS TYPES OF LICENSES AND AGREEMENTS TO PURCHASE

RAW MATERIALS OR OTHER GOODS, AS WELL AS PAYMENTS DUE UNDER

NON-CONTINGENT FUNDING OBLIGATIONS. FUNDING OBLIGATIONS INCLUDE,

FOR EXAMPLE, AGREEMENTS TO FUND VARIOUS PROJECTS WITH OTHER

COMPANIES.

3

AMOUNTS REPRESENT PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST CASH PAYMENTS OVER

THE LIFE OF THE DEBT OBLIGATIONS, INCLUDING ANTICIPATED INTEREST

PAYMENTS THAT ARE NOT RECORDED ON OUR CONSOLIDATED BALANCE

SHEET. ANY FUTURE SETTLEMENT OF CONVERTIBLE DEBT WOULD IMPACT

OUR CASH PAYMENTS.

4

WE ARE UNABLE TO RELIABLY ESTIMATE THE TIMING OF FUTURE

PAYMENTS RELATED TO UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS; THEREFORE, $190

MILLION OF LONG-TERM INCOME TAXES PAYABLE HAS BEEN EXCLUDED FROM

THE PRECEDING TABLE. HOWEVER, LONG-TERM INCOME TAXES PAYABLE,

INCLUDED ON OUR CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET, INCLUDED THESE

UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS, REDUCED BY THE ASSOCIATED FEDERAL

DEDUCTION FOR STATE TAXES AND U.S. TAX CREDITS ARISING FROM

NON-U.S.

INCOME.

5

AMOUNTS REPRESENT FUTURE CASH PAYMENTS TO SATISFY OTHER

LONG-TERM LIABILITIES RECORDED ON OUR CONSOLIDATED BALANCE

LIABILITIES. EXPECTED CONTRIBUTIONS TO OUR U.S. AND

NON-U.S.

PENSION PLANS AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS OF $56

MILLION TO BE MADE DURING 2011 ARE ALSO INCLUDED; HOWEVER,

FUNDING PROJECTIONS BEYOND 2011 ARE NOT PRACTICAL TO

ESTIMATE.

6

TOTAL GENERALLY EXCLUDES CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS ALREADY

RECORDED ON OUR CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET AS CURRENT

LIABILITIES.

CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS FOR PURCHASES OF GOODS OR SERVICES

INCLUDE AGREEMENTS THAT ARE ENFORCEABLE AND LEGALLY BINDING ON

INTEL AND THAT SPECIFY ALL SIGNIFICANT TERMS, INCLUDING FIXED OR

MINIMUM QUANTITIES TO BE PURCHASED; FIXED, MINIMUM, OR VARIABLE

PRICE PROVISIONS; AND THE APPROXIMATE TIMING OF THE TRANSACTION.

FOR OBLIGATIONS WITH CANCELLATION PROVISIONS, THE AMOUNTS

INCLUDED IN THE PRECEDING TABLE WERE LIMITED TO THE

NON-CANCELABLE PORTION OF THE AGREEMENT TERMS

AND/OR

THE

MINIMUM CANCELLATION FEE.

WE HAVE ENTERED INTO CERTAIN AGREEMENTS FOR THE PURCHASE OF RAW

MATERIALS THAT SPECIFY MINIMUM PRICES AND QUANTITIES BASED ON A

PERCENTAGE OF THE TOTAL AVAILABLE MARKET OR BASED ON A

PERCENTAGE OF OUR FUTURE PURCHASING REQUIREMENTS. DUE TO THE

UNCERTAINTY OF THE FUTURE MARKET AND OUR FUTURE PURCHASING

REQUIREMENTS, AS WELL AS THE NON-BINDING NATURE OF THESE

AGREEMENTS, OBLIGATIONS UNDER THESE AGREEMENTS ARE NOT INCLUDED

IN THE PRECEDING TABLE. OUR PURCHASE ORDERS FOR OTHER PRODUCTS

ARE BASED ON OUR CURRENT MANUFACTURING NEEDS AND ARE FULFILLED

BY OUR VENDORS WITHIN SHORT TIME HORIZONS. IN ADDITION, SOME OF

OUR PURCHASE ORDERS REPRESENT AUTHORIZATIONS TO PURCHASE RATHER

THAN BINDING AGREEMENTS.

CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS THAT ARE CONTINGENT UPON THE ACHIEVEMENT

OF CERTAIN MILESTONES ARE NOT INCLUDED IN THE PRECEDING TABLE.

THESE OBLIGATIONS INCLUDE CONTINGENT FUNDING/PAYMENT OBLIGATIONS

AND MILESTONE-BASED EQUITY INVESTMENT FUNDING. THESE

ARRANGEMENTS ARE NOT CONSIDERED CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS UNTIL

THE MILESTONE IS MET BY THE THIRD PARTY. ASSUMING THAT ALL

FUTURE MILESTONES ARE MET, ADDITIONAL REQUIRED PAYMENTS RELATED

TO THESE OBLIGATIONS WERE NOT SIGNIFICANT AS OF DECEMBER 25,

2010.

FOR THE MAJORITY OF RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS GRANTED, THE NUMBER

OF SHARES ISSUED ON THE DATE THE RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS VEST IS

NET OF THE MINIMUM STATUTORY WITHHOLDING REQUIREMENTS THAT WE

PAY IN CASH TO THE APPROPRIATE TAXING AUTHORITIES ON BEHALF OF

OUR EMPLOYEES. THE OBLIGATION TO PAY THE RELATIVE TAXING

AUTHORITY IS NOT INCLUDED IN THE PRECEDING TABLE, AS THE AMOUNT

IS CONTINGENT UPON CONTINUED EMPLOYMENT. IN ADDITION, THE AMOUNT

OF THE OBLIGATION IS UNKNOWN, AS IT IS BASED IN PART ON THE

MARKET PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK WHEN THE AWARDS VEST.

WE HAVE A CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATION TO PURCHASE THE OUTPUT OF IMFT

IN PROPORTION TO OUR INVESTMENT, WHICH WAS 49% AS OF DECEMBER

25, 2010. WE ALSO HAVE SEVERAL AGREEMENTS WITH MICRON RELATED TO

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS, AND R&D FUNDING RELATED TO

NAND FLASH MANUFACTURING. THE OBLIGATION TO PURCHASE OUR

PROPORTION OF IMFTS INVENTORY WAS APPROXIMATELY $100

MILLION AS OF DECEMBER 25, 2010. SEE NOTE 11: EQUITY

METHOD AND COST METHOD INVESTMENTS IN PART II, ITEM 8 OF

IN JANUARY 2011, WE ENTERED INTO A PATENT CROSS-LICENSE

AGREEMENT WITH NVIDIA. WE AGREED TO MAKE PAYMENTS TOTALING $1.5

BILLION TO NVIDIA OVER SIX YEARS ($300 MILLION IN EACH OF

JANUARY 2011, 2012, AND 2013; AND $200 MILLION IN EACH OF

JANUARY 2014, 2015, AND 2016). FOR FURTHER INFORMATION, SEE

DURING 2010, WE ENTERED INTO A DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT TO ACQUIRE

ALL OUTSTANDING COMMON SHARES OF MCAFEE FOR $48.00 PER SHARE IN

CASH TO BE PAID TO THE STOCKHOLDERS OF MCAFEE. AS OF THE DATE

THAT WE ENTERED INTO THE AGREEMENT, THE TRANSACTION HAD AN

APPROXIMATE VALUE OF $7.68 BILLION. WE EXPECT TO COMPLETE THE

ACQUISITION IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2011. THE TRANSACTION IS

SUBJECT TO CUSTOMARY CLOSING CONDITIONS. FOR FURTHER

INFORMATION, SEE NOTE 15: ACQUISITIONS IN PART II,

ITEM 8 OF THIS FORM

DURING 2010, WE ENTERED INTO A DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT TO ACQUIRE

TABLE OF CONTENTS

ITEM 7A.

QUANTITATIVE

AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

WE USE DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS PRIMARILY TO MANAGE

CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE AND INTEREST RATE RISK, AND, TO A LESSER

EXTENT, EQUITY MARKET AND COMMODITY PRICE RISK. ALL OF THE

POTENTIAL CHANGES NOTED BELOW ARE BASED ON SENSITIVITY ANALYSES

PERFORMED ON OUR FINANCIAL POSITIONS AS OF DECEMBER 25, 2010 AND

DECEMBER 26, 2009. ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER MATERIALLY.

CURRENCY

EXCHANGE RATES

IN GENERAL, WE ECONOMICALLY HEDGE CURRENCY RISKS OF

NON-U.S.-DOLLAR-DENOMINATED

INVESTMENTS IN DEBT INSTRUMENTS AND LOANS RECEIVABLE WITH

OFFSETTING CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS OR CURRENCY INTEREST RATE

SWAPS. GAINS AND LOSSES ON THESE

NON-U.S.-CURRENCY

INVESTMENTS WOULD GENERALLY BE OFFSET BY CORRESPONDING LOSSES

AND GAINS ON THE RELATED HEDGING INSTRUMENTS, RESULTING IN A

NEGLIGIBLE NET EXPOSURE TO LOSS.

SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR REVENUE IS TRANSACTED IN U.S. DOLLARS.

HOWEVER, A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF OUR OPERATING EXPENDITURES AND

CAPITAL PURCHASES ARE INCURRED IN OR EXPOSED TO OTHER

CURRENCIES, PRIMARILY THE JAPANESE YEN, THE EURO, AND THE

ISRAELI SHEKEL. WE HAVE ESTABLISHED BALANCE SHEET AND FORECASTED

TRANSACTION CURRENCY RISK MANAGEMENT PROGRAMS TO PROTECT AGAINST

FLUCTUATIONS IN FAIR VALUE AND THE VOLATILITY OF FUTURE CASH

FLOWS CAUSED BY CHANGES IN EXCHANGE RATES. WE GENERALLY UTILIZE

CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS AND, TO A LESSER EXTENT, CURRENCY

OPTIONS IN THESE HEDGING PROGRAMS. OUR HEDGING PROGRAMS REDUCE,

BUT DO NOT ALWAYS ENTIRELY ELIMINATE, THE IMPACT OF CURRENCY

EXCHANGE RATE MOVEMENTS (SEE RISK FACTORS IN PART I,

ITEM 1A OF THIS FORM

10-K).

WE

CONSIDERED THE HISTORICAL TRENDS IN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES AND

DETERMINED THAT IT WAS REASONABLY POSSIBLE THAT A WEIGHTED

AVERAGE ADVERSE CHANGE OF 20% IN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES COULD

BE EXPERIENCED IN THE NEAR TERM. SUCH AN ADVERSE CHANGE, AFTER

TAKING INTO ACCOUNT HEDGES AND OFFSETTING POSITIONS, WOULD HAVE

RESULTED IN AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON INCOME BEFORE TAXES OF LESS

THAN $35 MILLION AS OF DECEMBER 25, 2010 (LESS THAN $40 MILLION

AS OF DECEMBER 26, 2009).

INTEREST

RATES

WE GENERALLY HEDGE INTEREST RATE RISKS OF FIXED-RATE DEBT

INSTRUMENTS WITH OFFSETTING INTEREST RATE SWAPS. GAINS AND

LOSSES ON THESE INVESTMENTS WOULD GENERALLY BE OFFSET BY

CORRESPONDING LOSSES AND GAINS ON THE RELATED HEDGING

INSTRUMENTS, RESULTING IN A NEGLIGIBLE NET EXPOSURE TO INTEREST

RATE LOSS.

WE ARE EXPOSED TO INTEREST RATE RISK RELATED TO OUR INVESTMENT

PORTFOLIO AND DEBT ISSUANCES. WE REFER TO OUR COMBINED

INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO, INVESTMENT HEDGES, AND DEBT ISSUANCES AS

OUR NET INVESTMENT POSITION. THE PRIMARY OBJECTIVE OF OUR

INVESTMENTS IN DEBT INSTRUMENTS IS TO PRESERVE PRINCIPAL WHILE

MAXIMIZING YIELDS. TO ACHIEVE THIS OBJECTIVE, THE RETURNS ON OUR

INVESTMENTS IN DEBT INSTRUMENTS ARE GENERALLY BASED ON THE

U.S.-DOLLAR

THREE-MONTH LIBOR. A HYPOTHETICAL DECREASE IN INTEREST RATES OF

1.0% WOULD HAVE RESULTED IN AN INCREASE IN THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR

DEBT ISSUANCES OF APPROXIMATELY $235 MILLION AS OF DECEMBER 25,

2010 (AN INCREASE OF APPROXIMATELY $205 MILLION AS OF DECEMBER

26, 2009). A HYPOTHETICAL DECREASE IN INTEREST RATES OF UP TO

1.0%, AFTER TAKING INTO ACCOUNT INVESTMENT HEDGES, WOULD HAVE

RESULTED IN AN INCREASE IN THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR INVESTMENT

PORTFOLIO OF UP TO APPROXIMATELY $15 MILLION AS OF DECEMBER 25,

2010 (AN INCREASE OF APPROXIMATELY $10 MILLION AS OF DECEMBER

26, 2009). THESE HYPOTHETICAL DECREASES IN INTEREST RATES WOULD

HAVE RESULTED IN A DECREASE IN THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR NET

INVESTMENT POSITION OF APPROXIMATELY $220 MILLION AS OF DECEMBER

25, 2010 (A DECREASE OF $195 MILLION AS OF DECEMBER 26, 2009).

THE FLUCTUATIONS IN FAIR VALUE OF OUR NET INVESTMENT POSITION

REFLECT ONLY THE DIRECT IMPACT OF THE CHANGE IN INTEREST RATES.

OTHER ECONOMIC VARIABLES, SUCH AS EQUITY MARKET FLUCTUATIONS AND

CHANGES IN RELATIVE CREDIT RISK, COULD RESULT IN A SIGNIFICANTLY

HIGHER DECLINE IN OUR NET INVESTMENT POSITION. FOR FURTHER

INFORMATION ON HOW CREDIT RISK IS FACTORED INTO THE VALUATION OF

OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO AND DEBT ISSUANCES, SEE FAIR

VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS IN PART II, ITEM 7 OF THIS

FORM

10-K.

EQUITY

PRICES

OUR MARKETABLE EQUITY INVESTMENTS INCLUDE MARKETABLE EQUITY

SECURITIES AND EQUITY DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS SUCH AS WARRANTS

AND OPTIONS. TO THE EXTENT THAT OUR MARKETABLE EQUITY SECURITIES

HAVE STRATEGIC VALUE, WE TYPICALLY DO NOT ATTEMPT TO REDUCE OR

ELIMINATE OUR EQUITY MARKET EXPOSURE THROUGH HEDGING ACTIVITIES;

HOWEVER, FOR OUR INVESTMENTS IN STRATEGIC EQUITY DERIVATIVE

INSTRUMENTS, WE MAY ENTER INTO TRANSACTIONS TO REDUCE OR

ELIMINATE THE EQUITY MARKET RISKS. FOR SECURITIES THAT WE NO

LONGER CONSIDER STRATEGIC, WE EVALUATE LEGAL, MARKET, AND

ECONOMIC FACTORS IN OUR DECISION ON THE TIMING OF DISPOSAL, AND

WHETHER IT IS POSSIBLE AND APPROPRIATE TO HEDGE THE EQUITY

MARKET RISK.

WE HOLD DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS THAT SEEK TO OFFSET CHANGES IN

LIABILITIES RELATED TO THE EQUITY MARKET RISKS OF CERTAIN

DEFERRED COMPENSATION ARRANGEMENTS. THE GAINS AND LOSSES FROM

CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE OF THESE DERIVATIVES ARE DESIGNED TO

OFFSET THE GAINS AND LOSSES ON THE RELATED LIABILITIES,

RESULTING IN AN INSIGNIFICANT NET EXPOSURE TO LOSS.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

AS OF DECEMBER 25, 2010, THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR MARKETABLE EQUITY

INVESTMENTS AND OUR EQUITY DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS, INCLUDING

HEDGING POSITIONS, WAS $1.5 BILLION ($805 MILLION AS OF DECEMBER

26, 2009). OUR MARKETABLE EQUITY INVESTMENTS INCLUDE OUR

INVESTMENTS IN MICRON, IMAGINATION TECHNOLOGIES GROUP PLC,

VMWARE, INC., AND CLEARWIRE CORPORATION, AND WERE CARRIED AT A

TOTAL FAIR MARKET VALUE OF $968 MILLION, OR 65% OF OUR

MARKETABLE EQUITY PORTFOLIO, AS OF DECEMBER 25, 2010. OUR

MARKETABLE EQUITY METHOD INVESTMENT IN SMART IS EXCLUDED FROM

OUR ANALYSIS, AS THE CARRYING VALUE DOES NOT FLUCTUATE BASED ON

MARKET PRICE CHANGES UNLESS AN

OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY

IMPAIRMENT IS DEEMED NECESSARY. TO DETERMINE REASONABLY POSSIBLE

DECREASES IN THE MARKET VALUE OF OUR MARKETABLE EQUITY

INVESTMENTS, WE ANALYZED THE EXPECTED MARKET PRICE SENSITIVITY

OF OUR MARKETABLE EQUITY INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO. ASSUMING A LOSS

OF 40% IN MARKET PRICES, AND AFTER REFLECTING THE IMPACT OF

HEDGES AND OFFSETTING POSITIONS, THE AGGREGATE VALUE OF OUR

MARKETABLE EQUITY INVESTMENTS COULD DECREASE BY APPROXIMATELY

$365 MILLION, BASED ON THE VALUE AS OF DECEMBER 25, 2010 (A

DECREASE IN VALUE OF APPROXIMATELY $405 MILLION, BASED ON THE

VALUE AS OF DECEMBER 26, 2009 USING AN ASSUMED LOSS OF 50%).

MANY OF THE SAME FACTORS THAT COULD RESULT IN AN ADVERSE

MOVEMENT OF EQUITY MARKET PRICES AFFECT OUR NON-MARKETABLE

EQUITY INVESTMENTS, ALTHOUGH WE CANNOT ALWAYS QUANTIFY THE

IMPACT DIRECTLY. FINANCIAL MARKETS ARE VOLATILE, WHICH COULD

NEGATIVELY AFFECT THE PROSPECTS OF THE COMPANIES WE INVEST IN,

THEIR ABILITY TO RAISE ADDITIONAL CAPITAL, AND THE LIKELIHOOD OF

OUR BEING ABLE TO REALIZE VALUE IN OUR INVESTMENTS THROUGH

LIQUIDITY EVENTS SUCH AS INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERINGS, MERGERS, AND

PRIVATE SALES. THESE TYPES OF INVESTMENTS INVOLVE A GREAT DEAL

OF RISK, AND THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT ANY SPECIFIC COMPANY

WILL GROW OR BECOME SUCCESSFUL; CONSEQUENTLY, WE COULD LOSE ALL

OR PART OF OUR INVESTMENT. OUR NON-MARKETABLE EQUITY

INVESTMENTS, EXCLUDING INVESTMENTS ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER THE

EQUITY METHOD, HAD A CARRYING AMOUNT OF $872 MILLION AS OF

DECEMBER 25, 2010 ($939 MILLION AS OF DECEMBER 26, 2009). AS OF

DECEMBER 25, 2010, THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF OUR NON-MARKETABLE

EQUITY METHOD INVESTMENTS WAS $1.8 BILLION ($2.5 BILLION AS OF

DECEMBER 26, 2009). A SUBSTANTIAL MAJORITY OF THIS BALANCE AS OF

DECEMBER 25, 2010 WAS CONCENTRATED IN OUR IMFT/IMFS INVESTMENT

OF $1.5 BILLION ($1.6 BILLION AS OF DECEMBER 26, 2009). OUR

INVESTMENTS AS OF DECEMBER 26, 2009 ALSO INCLUDED AN INVESTMENT

OF $453 MILLION IN NUMONYX, WHICH WAS SOLD IN 2010. FOR FURTHER

INFORMATION, SEE NOTE 11: EQUITY METHOD AND COST METHOD

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 1.

BASIS OF PRESENTATION

WE HAVE A 52- OR 53-WEEK FISCAL YEAR THAT ENDS ON THE LAST

SATURDAY IN DECEMBER. FISCAL YEARS 2010, 2009, AND 2008 WERE ALL

52-WEEK YEARS. FISCAL YEAR 2011 IS A 53-WEEK YEAR. OUR

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDE THE ACCOUNTS OF INTEL

CORPORATION AND OUR WHOLLY OWNED SUBSIDIARIES. INTERCOMPANY

ACCOUNTS AND TRANSACTIONS HAVE BEEN ELIMINATED. WE USE THE

EQUITY METHOD TO ACCOUNT FOR EQUITY INVESTMENTS IN INSTANCES IN

WHICH WE OWN COMMON STOCK OR SIMILAR INTERESTS AND HAVE THE

ABILITY TO EXERCISE SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE, BUT NOT CONTROL, OVER

THE INVESTEE. FOR ALL FISCAL YEARS PRESENTED, THE U.S. DOLLAR IS

THE FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY FOR INTEL AND OUR SUBSIDIARIES;

THEREFORE, WE DO NOT HAVE A TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENT RECORDED

THROUGH ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS).

NOTE 2.

ACCOUNTING POLICIES

USE OF

ESTIMATES

THE PREPARATION OF CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN

CONFORMITY WITH U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES

REQUIRES US TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS THAT AFFECT THE

AMOUNTS REPORTED IN OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND

THE ACCOMPANYING NOTES. THE ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES THAT REQUIRE

OUR MOST SIGNIFICANT, DIFFICULT, AND SUBJECTIVE JUDGMENTS

INCLUDE.



THE VALUATION OF NON-MARKETABLE EQUITY INVESTMENTS AND THE

DETERMINATION OF

OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY

IMPAIRMENTS;



THE ASSESSMENT OF RECOVERABILITY OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS;



THE RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT OF CURRENT AND DEFERRED INCOME

TAXES (INCLUDING THE MEASUREMENT OF UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS);



THE VALUATION OF INVENTORY; AND



THE RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT OF LOSS CONTINGENCIES.

THE ACTUAL RESULTS THAT WE EXPERIENCE MAY DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM

OUR ESTIMATES.

FAIR

VALUE

FAIR VALUE IS THE PRICE THAT WOULD BE RECEIVED FROM SELLING AN

ASSET OR PAID TO TRANSFER A LIABILITY IN AN ORDERLY TRANSACTION

BETWEEN MARKET PARTICIPANTS AT THE MEASUREMENT DATE. WHEN

DETERMINING FAIR VALUE, WE CONSIDER THE PRINCIPAL OR MOST

ADVANTAGEOUS MARKET IN WHICH WE WOULD TRANSACT, AND WE CONSIDER

ASSUMPTIONS THAT MARKET PARTICIPANTS WOULD USE WHEN PRICING THE

ASSET OR LIABILITY. OUR FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS ARE MEASURED AND

RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE, EXCEPT FOR EQUITY METHOD INVESTMENTS,

COST METHOD INVESTMENTS, COST METHOD LOANS RECEIVABLE, AND MOST

OF OUR LIABILITIES.

FAIR

VALUE HIERARCHY

THE THREE LEVELS OF INPUTS THAT MAY BE USED TO MEASURE FAIR

VALUE ARE AS FOLLOWS.

LEVEL 1.

QUOTED PRICES IN ACTIVE MARKETS FOR

IDENTICAL ASSETS OR LIABILITIES.

LEVEL 2.

OBSERVABLE INPUTS OTHER THAN LEVEL 1

PRICES, SUCH AS QUOTED PRICES FOR SIMILAR ASSETS OR LIABILITIES,

QUOTED PRICES IN MARKETS WITH INSUFFICIENT VOLUME OR INFREQUENT

TRANSACTIONS (LESS ACTIVE MARKETS), OR MODEL-DERIVED VALUATIONS

IN WHICH ALL SIGNIFICANT INPUTS ARE OBSERVABLE OR CAN BE DERIVED

PRINCIPALLY FROM OR CORROBORATED WITH OBSERVABLE MARKET DATA FOR

SUBSTANTIALLY THE FULL TERM OF THE ASSETS OR LIABILITIES. LEVEL

2 INPUTS ALSO INCLUDE NON-BINDING MARKET CONSENSUS PRICES THAT

CAN BE CORROBORATED WITH OBSERVABLE MARKET DATA, AS WELL AS

QUOTED PRICES THAT WERE ADJUSTED FOR SECURITY-SPECIFIC

RESTRICTIONS.

LEVEL 3.

UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS TO THE VALUATION

METHODOLOGY THAT ARE SIGNIFICANT TO THE MEASUREMENT OF THE FAIR

VALUE OF ASSETS OR LIABILITIES. LEVEL 3 INPUTS ALSO INCLUDE

NON-BINDING MARKET CONSENSUS PRICES OR NON-BINDING BROKER QUOTES

THAT WE WERE UNABLE TO CORROBORATE WITH OBSERVABLE MARKET DATA.

FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION OF FAIR VALUE, SEE NOTE

5: FAIR VALUE AND NOTE 22: RETIREMENT BENEFIT

PLANS.

TRADING

ASSETS

MARKETABLE DEBT INSTRUMENTS ARE DESIGNATED AS TRADING ASSETS

WHEN THE INTEREST RATE OR FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATE RISK IS

ECONOMICALLY HEDGED AT INCEPTION WITH A RELATED DERIVATIVE

INSTRUMENT. INVESTMENTS DESIGNATED AS TRADING ASSETS ARE

REPORTED AT FAIR VALUE. THE GAINS OR LOSSES OF THESE INVESTMENTS

ARISING FROM CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE DUE TO INTEREST RATE AND

CURRENCY MARKET FLUCTUATIONS AND CREDIT MARKET VOLATILITY,

OFFSET BY LOSSES OR GAINS ON THE RELATED DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS,

ARE RECORDED IN INTEREST AND OTHER, NET. WE ALSO DESIGNATE

CERTAIN FLOATING-RATE SECURITIZED FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS,

PRIMARILY ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES, AS TRADING ASSETS.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

INTEL

CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2010, WE SOLD OUR OWNERSHIP INTEREST IN

NUMONYX B.V. TO MICRON TECHNOLOGY, INC. FOR CONSIDERATION

CONSISTING OF SHARES OF MICRON. THE MICRON SHARES THAT WE

RECEIVED IN THE TRANSACTION ARE CLASSIFIED AS MARKETABLE EQUITY

SECURITIES WITHIN TRADING ASSETS. OUR INTEREST IN MICRON MAKES

UP MOST OF THE BALANCE OF MARKETABLE EQUITY SECURITIES INCLUDED

IN TRADING ASSETS. WE HAVE ENTERED INTO EQUITY OPTIONS THAT

ECONOMICALLY HEDGE OUR REMAINING OWNERSHIP INTEREST IN MICRON.

GAINS AND LOSSES FROM THE CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF MICRON

SHARES ARE MOSTLY OFFSET BY CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE

RELATED EQUITY OPTIONS AND ARE RECORDED AS GAINS (LOSSES) ON

OTHER EQUITY INVESTMENTS, NET. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION, SEE

NOTE 11: EQUITY METHOD AND COST METHOD INVESTMENTS.

AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE

INVESTMENTS

WE CONSIDER ALL LIQUID

AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE

DEBT INSTRUMENTS WITH ORIGINAL MATURITIES FROM THE DATE OF

PURCHASE OF APPROXIMATELY THREE MONTHS OR LESS TO BE CASH AND

CASH EQUIVALENTS.

AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE

DEBT INSTRUMENTS WITH ORIGINAL MATURITIES AT THE DATE OF

PURCHASE GREATER THAN APPROXIMATELY THREE MONTHS AND REMAINING

MATURITIES OF LESS THAN ONE YEAR ARE CLASSIFIED AS SHORT-TERM

INVESTMENTS.

AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE

DEBT INSTRUMENTS WITH REMAINING MATURITIES BEYOND ONE YEAR ARE

CLASSIFIED AS OTHER LONG-TERM INVESTMENTS.

INVESTMENTS THAT WE DESIGNATE AS

AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE

ARE REPORTED AT FAIR VALUE, WITH UNREALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES,

NET OF TAX, RECORDED IN ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME

(LOSS), EXCEPT AS NOTED IN THE

OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY

IMPAIRMENT SECTION BELOW. WE DETERMINE THE COST OF THE

INVESTMENT SOLD BASED ON AN AVERAGE COST BASIS AT THE INDIVIDUAL

SECURITY LEVEL. OUR

AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE

INVESTMENTS INCLUDE.



MARKETABLE DEBT INSTRUMENTS

WHEN THE INTEREST RATE AND

FOREIGN CURRENCY RISKS ARE NOT HEDGED AT INCEPTION OF THE

INVESTMENT OR WHEN OUR DESIGNATION FOR TRADING ASSETS IS NOT

MET. WE GENERALLY HOLD THESE DEBT INSTRUMENTS TO GENERATE A

RETURN COMMENSURATE WITH THE

U.S.-DOLLAR

THREE-MONTH LIBOR. WE RECORD THE INTEREST INCOME AND REALIZED

GAINS AND LOSSES ON THE SALE OF THESE INSTRUMENTS IN INTEREST

AND OTHER, NET.



MARKETABLE EQUITY SECURITIES

WHEN THE INVESTMENTS ARE

CONSIDERED STRATEGIC IN NATURE AT THE TIME OF ORIGINAL

CLASSIFICATION OR THERE ARE BARRIERS TO MITIGATING EQUITY MARKET

RISK THROUGH THE SALE OR USE OF DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AT THE

TIME OF ORIGINAL CLASSIFICATION. WE ACQUIRE THESE EQUITY

INVESTMENTS FOR THE PROMOTION OF BUSINESS AND STRATEGIC

OBJECTIVES. TO THE EXTENT THAT THESE INVESTMENTS CONTINUE TO

HAVE STRATEGIC VALUE, WE TYPICALLY DO NOT ATTEMPT TO REDUCE OR

DERIVATIVE

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

OUR PRIMARY OBJECTIVE FOR HOLDING DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL

INSTRUMENTS IS TO MANAGE CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE AND INTEREST

RATE RISK, AND, TO A LESSER EXTENT, EQUITY MARKET AND COMMODITY

PRICE RISK. OUR DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS ARE RECORDED AT

FAIR VALUE AND ARE INCLUDED IN OTHER CURRENT ASSETS, OTHER

LONG-TERM ASSETS, OTHER ACCRUED LIABILITIES, OR OTHER LONG-TERM

LIABILITIES.

OUR ACCOUNTING POLICIES FOR DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS ARE

BASED ON WHETHER THEY MEET THE CRITERIA FOR DESIGNATION AS CASH

FLOW OR FAIR VALUE HEDGES. A DESIGNATED HEDGE OF THE EXPOSURE TO

VARIABILITY IN THE FUTURE CASH FLOWS OF AN ASSET OR A LIABILITY,

OR OF A FORECASTED TRANSACTION, IS REFERRED TO AS A CASH FLOW

HEDGE. A DESIGNATED HEDGE OF THE EXPOSURE TO CHANGES IN FAIR

VALUE OF AN ASSET OR A LIABILITY, OR OF AN UNRECOGNIZED FIRM

COMMITMENT, IS REFERRED TO AS A FAIR VALUE HEDGE. THE CRITERIA

FOR DESIGNATING A DERIVATIVE AS A HEDGE INCLUDE THE ASSESSMENT

OF THE INSTRUMENTS EFFECTIVENESS IN RISK REDUCTION,

MATCHING OF THE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENT TO ITS UNDERLYING

TRANSACTION, AND THE ASSESSMENT OF THE PROBABILITY THAT THE

UNDERLYING TRANSACTION WILL OCCUR. FOR DERIVATIVES WITH CASH

FLOW HEDGE ACCOUNTING DESIGNATION, WE REPORT THE AFTER-TAX GAIN

OR LOSS FROM THE EFFECTIVE PORTION OF THE HEDGE AS A COMPONENT

OF ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS) AND RECLASSIFY

IT INTO EARNINGS IN THE SAME PERIOD OR PERIODS IN WHICH THE

HEDGED TRANSACTION AFFECTS EARNINGS, AND WITHIN THE SAME LINE

ITEM ON THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME AS THE IMPACT OF

THE HEDGED TRANSACTION. FOR DERIVATIVES WITH FAIR VALUE HEDGE

ACCOUNTING DESIGNATION, WE RECOGNIZE GAINS OR LOSSES FROM THE

CHANGE IN FAIR VALUE OF THESE DERIVATIVES, AS WELL AS THE

OFFSETTING CHANGE IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE UNDERLYING HEDGED

ITEM, IN EARNINGS. DERIVATIVES THAT WE DESIGNATE AS HEDGES ARE

CLASSIFIED IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS IN THE

SAME SECTION AS THE UNDERLYING ITEM, PRIMARILY WITHIN CASH FLOWS

FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES.

WE RECOGNIZE GAINS AND LOSSES FROM CHANGES IN FAIR VALUES OF

DERIVATIVES THAT ARE NOT DESIGNATED AS HEDGES FOR ACCOUNTING

PURPOSES WITHIN THE LINE ITEM ON THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF

INCOME MOST CLOSELY ASSOCIATED WITH THE ECONOMIC UNDERLYING,

PRIMARILY IN INTEREST AND OTHER, NET AND GAINS (LOSSES) ON OTHER

EQUITY INVESTMENTS, NET. AS PART OF OUR STRATEGIC INVESTMENT

PROGRAM, WE ALSO ACQUIRE EQUITY DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS, SUCH AS

EQUITY CONVERSION RIGHTS ASSOCIATED WITH DEBT INSTRUMENTS, THAT

WE DO NOT DESIGNATE AS HEDGING INSTRUMENTS. WE RECOGNIZE THE

GAINS OR LOSSES FROM CHANGES IN FAIR VALUES OF THESE EQUITY

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS IN GAINS (LOSSES) ON OTHER EQUITY

INVESTMENTS, NET. GAINS AND LOSSES FROM DERIVATIVES NOT

DESIGNATED AS HEDGES ARE CLASSIFIED IN CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING

ACTIVITIES.

MEASUREMENT

OF EFFECTIVENESS



EFFECTIVENESS FOR FORWARDS

IS GENERALLY MEASURED BY

COMPARING THE CUMULATIVE CHANGE IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE HEDGE

CONTRACT WITH THE CUMULATIVE CHANGE IN THE PRESENT VALUE OF THE

FORECASTED CASH FLOWS OF THE HEDGED ITEM. FOR CURRENCY FORWARD

CONTRACTS USED IN CASH FLOW HEDGING STRATEGIES RELATED TO

CAPITAL PURCHASES, FORWARD POINTS ARE EXCLUDED, AND

EFFECTIVENESS IS MEASURED USING SPOT RATES TO VALUE BOTH THE

HEDGE CONTRACT AND THE HEDGED ITEM. FOR CURRENCY FORWARD

CONTRACTS USED IN CASH FLOW HEDGING STRATEGIES RELATED TO

OPERATING EXPENDITURES, FORWARD POINTS ARE INCLUDED AND

EFFECTIVENESS IS MEASURED USING FORWARD RATES TO VALUE BOTH THE

HEDGE CONTRACT AND THE HEDGED ITEM.



EFFECTIVENESS FOR OPTIONS WITH HEDGE ACCOUNTING DESIGNATION

IS GENERALLY MEASURED BY COMPARING THE CUMULATIVE CHANGE IN

THE INTRINSIC VALUE OF THE HEDGE CONTRACT WITH THE CUMULATIVE

CHANGE IN THE INTRINSIC VALUE OF AN OPTION INSTRUMENT

REPRESENTING THE HEDGED RISKS IN THE HEDGED ITEM FOR CASH FLOW

HEDGES. FOR CASH FLOW AND FAIR VALUE HEDGES, TIME VALUE IS

EXCLUDED AND EFFECTIVENESS IS MEASURED BASED ON SPOT RATES TO

VALUE BOTH THE HEDGE CONTRACT AND THE HEDGED ITEM.



EFFECTIVENESS FOR INTEREST RATE SWAPS AND COMMODITY SWAPS

IS GENERALLY MEASURED BY COMPARING THE CHANGE IN FAIR VALUE

OF THE HEDGED ITEM WITH THE CHANGE IN FAIR VALUE OF THE SWAP.

IF A CASH FLOW HEDGE IS DISCONTINUED BECAUSE IT IS NO LONGER

PROBABLE THAT THE ORIGINAL HEDGED TRANSACTION WILL OCCUR AS

ANTICIPATED, THE UNREALIZED GAIN OR LOSS ON THE RELATED

DERIVATIVE IS RECLASSIFIED INTO EARNINGS. SUBSEQUENT GAINS OR

LOSSES ON THE RELATED DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENT ARE RECOGNIZED IN

INTEREST AND OTHER, NET IN EACH PERIOD UNTIL THE INSTRUMENT

MATURES, IS TERMINATED, IS RE-DESIGNATED AS A QUALIFIED HEDGE,

OR IS SOLD. INEFFECTIVE PORTIONS OF CASH FLOW HEDGES AND FAIR

VALUE HEDGES, AS WELL AS AMOUNTS EXCLUDED FROM THE ASSESSMENT OF

EFFECTIVENESS, ARE RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS IN INTEREST AND OTHER,

NET. FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION OF OUR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS, SEE

NOTE 8: DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS.

SECURITIES

LENDING

WE MAY ENTER INTO SECURITIES LENDING AGREEMENTS WITH FINANCIAL

INSTITUTIONS, GENERALLY TO FACILITATE HEDGING AND CERTAIN

INVESTMENT TRANSACTIONS. SELECTED SECURITIES MAY BE LOANED,

SECURED BY COLLATERAL IN THE FORM OF CASH OR SECURITIES. THE

LOANED SECURITIES CONTINUE TO BE CARRIED AS INVESTMENT ASSETS ON

OUR CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS. CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENT

COLLATERAL IS RECORDED AS AN ASSET WITH A CORRESPONDING

LIABILITY. FOR LENDING AGREEMENTS COLLATERALIZED BY SECURITIES,

WE DO NOT RECORD THE COLLATERAL AS AN ASSET OR A LIABILITY,

UNLESS THE COLLATERAL IS REPLEDGED.

LOANS

RECEIVABLE

WE MAKE LOANS TO THIRD PARTIES THAT ARE CLASSIFIED WITHIN OTHER

CURRENT ASSETS OR OTHER LONG-TERM ASSETS. WE MAY ELECT THE FAIR

VALUE OPTION FOR LOANS WHEN THE INTEREST RATE OR FOREIGN

EXCHANGE RATE RISK IS ECONOMICALLY HEDGED AT INCEPTION WITH A

RELATED DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENT. WE RECORD THE GAINS OR LOSSES ON

THESE LOANS ARISING FROM CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE DUE TO INTEREST

RATE, CURRENCY MARKET FLUCTUATIONS, AND CREDIT MARKET

VOLATILITY, OFFSET BY LOSSES OR GAINS ON THE RELATED DERIVATIVE

INSTRUMENTS, IN INTEREST AND OTHER, NET. LOANS THAT ARE

DENOMINATED IN U.S. DOLLARS AND HAVE A FLOATING-RATE COUPON ARE

CARRIED AT AMORTIZED COST. WE MEASURE INTEREST INCOME FOR ALL

LOANS RECEIVABLE USING THE INTEREST METHOD, WHICH IS BASED ON

THE EFFECTIVE YIELD OF THE LOANS RATHER THAN THE STATED COUPON

RATE.

GOODWILL

WE RECORD GOODWILL WHEN THE PURCHASE PRICE OF AN ACQUISITION

EXCEEDS THE FAIR VALUE OF THE NET TANGIBLE AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS

AS OF THE DATE OF ACQUISITION, ASSIGNING THE GOODWILL TO OUR

APPLICABLE REPORTING UNITS BASED ON THE RELATIVE EXPECTED FAIR

VALUE PROVIDED BY THE ACQUISITION. WE PERFORM A QUARTERLY REVIEW

OF GOODWILL FOR INDICATORS OF IMPAIRMENT. DURING THE FOURTH

QUARTER OF EACH YEAR, WE PERFORM AN IMPAIRMENT REVIEW FOR EACH

REPORTING UNIT USING A FAIR VALUE APPROACH. WE DO NOT IDENTIFY

MANUFACTURING AND ASSEMBLY AND TEST ASSETS WITH INDIVIDUAL

REPORTING UNITS BECAUSE OF THE INTERCHANGEABLE NATURE OF OUR

MANUFACTURING AND ASSEMBLY AND TEST ASSETS. IN DETERMINING THE

CARRYING VALUE OF THE REPORTING UNIT, WE MAKE AN ALLOCATION OF

OUR MANUFACTURING AND ASSEMBLY AND TEST ASSETS BASED ON EACH

REPORTING UNITS RELATIVE PERCENTAGE UTILIZATION OF THE

MANUFACTURING AND ASSEMBLY AND TEST ASSETS. FOR FURTHER

DISCUSSION OF GOODWILL, SEE NOTE 17: GOODWILL.

IDENTIFIED

INTANGIBLE ASSETS

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY ASSETS PRIMARILY REPRESENT RIGHTS ACQUIRED

UNDER TECHNOLOGY LICENSES AND ARE GENERALLY AMORTIZED ON A

STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THE PERIODS OF BENEFIT, RANGING FROM 3

TO 17 YEARS. WE AMORTIZE ACQUISITION-RELATED DEVELOPED

TECHNOLOGY BASED ON ECONOMIC BENEFIT OVER THE ESTIMATED USEFUL

LIFE OF 4 YEARS. WE AMORTIZE OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS THAT ARE

SUBJECT TO AMORTIZATION OVER PERIODS RANGING FROM 1 TO 7 YEARS.

WE AMORTIZE ACQUISITION-RELATED IN-PROCESS RESEARCH AND

DEVELOPMENT OVER THE ESTIMATED USEFUL LIFE ONCE THE RESEARCH AND

DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS ARE COMPLETED. IN THE QUARTER FOLLOWING THE

PERIOD IN WHICH IDENTIFIED INTANGIBLE ASSETS BECOME FULLY

AMORTIZED, THE FULLY AMORTIZED BALANCES ARE REMOVED FROM THE

GROSS ASSET AND ACCUMULATED AMORTIZATION AMOUNTS.

WE PERFORM A QUARTERLY REVIEW OF IDENTIFIED INTANGIBLE ASSETS TO

DETERMINE IF FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THAT THE USEFUL

LIFE IS SHORTER THAN WE HAD ORIGINALLY ESTIMATED OR THAT THE

CARRYING AMOUNT OF ASSETS MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE. IF SUCH FACTS

AND CIRCUMSTANCES EXIST, WE ASSESS THE RECOVERABILITY OF

IDENTIFIED INTANGIBLE ASSETS BY COMPARING THE PROJECTED

UNDISCOUNTED NET CASH FLOWS ASSOCIATED WITH THE RELATED ASSET OR

GROUP OF ASSETS OVER THEIR REMAINING LIVES AGAINST THEIR

RESPECTIVE CARRYING AMOUNTS. IMPAIRMENTS, IF ANY, ARE BASED ON

THE EXCESS OF THE CARRYING AMOUNT OVER THE FAIR VALUE OF THOSE

ASSETS. IF THE USEFUL LIFE IS SHORTER THAN ORIGINALLY ESTIMATED,

WE ACCELERATE THE RATE OF AMORTIZATION AND AMORTIZE THE

REMAINING CARRYING VALUE OVER THE NEW SHORTER USEFUL LIFE.

FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION OF IDENTIFIED INTANGIBLE ASSETS, SEE

NOTE 18: IDENTIFIED INTANGIBLE ASSETS.

PRODUCT

WARRANTY

THE VAST MAJORITY OF OUR PRODUCTS ARE SOLD WITH A LIMITED

WARRANTY ON PRODUCT QUALITY AND A LIMITED INDEMNIFICATION FOR

CUSTOMERS AGAINST INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY INFRINGEMENT CLAIMS

RELATED TO OUR PRODUCTS. THE ACCRUAL AND THE RELATED EXPENSE FOR

KNOWN PRODUCT WARRANTY ISSUES WERE NOT SIGNIFICANT DURING THE

PERIODS PRESENTED. DUE TO PRODUCT TESTING, THE SHORT TIME

TYPICALLY BETWEEN PRODUCT SHIPMENT AND THE DETECTION AND

CORRECTION OF PRODUCT FAILURES, AND THE HISTORICAL RATE OF

PAYMENTS ON INDEMNIFICATION CLAIMS, THE ACCRUAL AND RELATED

EXPENSE FOR ESTIMATED INCURRED BUT UNIDENTIFIED ISSUES WERE NOT

SIGNIFICANT DURING THE PERIODS PRESENTED.

REVENUE

RECOGNITION

WE RECOGNIZE NET PRODUCT REVENUE WHEN THE EARNINGS PROCESS IS

COMPLETE, AS EVIDENCED BY AN AGREEMENT WITH THE CUSTOMER,

TRANSFER OF TITLE, AND ACCEPTANCE, IF APPLICABLE, AS WELL AS

FIXED PRICING AND PROBABLE COLLECTABILITY. WE RECORD PRICING

ALLOWANCES, INCLUDING DISCOUNTS BASED ON CONTRACTUAL

ARRANGEMENTS WITH CUSTOMERS, WHEN WE RECOGNIZE REVENUE AS A

REDUCTION TO BOTH ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND NET REVENUE. BECAUSE

OF FREQUENT SALES PRICE REDUCTIONS AND RAPID TECHNOLOGY

OBSOLESCENCE IN THE INDUSTRY, WE DEFER PRODUCT REVENUE AND

RELATED COSTS OF SALES FROM SALES MADE TO DISTRIBUTORS UNDER

AGREEMENTS ALLOWING PRICE PROTECTION OR RIGHT OF RETURN UNTIL

THE DISTRIBUTORS SELL THE MERCHANDISE. THE RIGHT OF RETURN

GRANTED GENERALLY CONSISTS OF A STOCK ROTATION PROGRAM IN WHICH

DISTRIBUTORS ARE ABLE TO EXCHANGE CERTAIN PRODUCTS BASED ON THE

NUMBER OF QUALIFIED PURCHASES MADE BY THE DISTRIBUTOR. UNDER THE

PRICE PROTECTION PROGRAM, WE GIVE DISTRIBUTORS CREDITS FOR THE

DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE ORIGINAL PRICE PAID AND THE CURRENT PRICE

THAT WE OFFER. WE RECORD THE NET DEFERRED INCOME FROM PRODUCT

SALES TO DISTRIBUTORS ON OUR BALANCE SHEET AS DEFERRED INCOME ON

SHIPMENTS TO DISTRIBUTORS. WE INCLUDE SHIPPING CHARGES BILLED TO

CUSTOMERS IN NET REVENUE, AND INCLUDE THE RELATED SHIPPING COSTS

IN COST OF SALES.

SALES OF SOFTWARE, PRIMARILY THROUGH OUR WIND RIVER SOFTWARE

GROUP, ARE MADE THROUGH TERM LICENSES THAT ARE GENERALLY 12

MONTHS IN LENGTH, OR PERPETUAL LICENSES. REVENUE IS GENERALLY

DEFERRED AND RECOGNIZED RATABLY OVER THE COURSE OF THE LICENSE.

THAT AN ADVERTISING BENEFIT SEPARATE FROM THE REVENUE

TRANSACTION CAN BE IDENTIFIED AND THE FAIR VALUE OF THAT

ADVERTISING BENEFIT RECEIVED IS DETERMINABLE. WE RECORD ANY

EXCESS IN CASH PAID OVER THE FAIR VALUE OF THE ADVERTISING

ACCOUNTING CHANGES

2010

IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2010, WE ADOPTED NEW STANDARDS FOR

DETERMINING WHETHER TO CONSOLIDATE A VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITY.

THESE NEW STANDARDS ELIMINATED A MANDATORY QUANTITATIVE APPROACH

IN FAVOR OF A QUALITATIVE ANALYSIS, AND REQUIRE AN ONGOING

REASSESSMENT. THE ADOPTION OF THESE NEW STANDARDS DID NOT IMPACT

OUR CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME OR BALANCE SHEETS.

2009

IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2009, WE ADOPTED NEW STANDARDS THAT

CHANGED THE ACCOUNTING FOR CONVERTIBLE DEBT INSTRUMENTS WITH

CASH SETTLEMENT FEATURES. AS OF ADOPTION, THESE NEW STANDARDS

APPLIED TO OUR JUNIOR SUBORDINATED CONVERTIBLE DEBENTURES ISSUED

IN 2005 (THE 2005 DEBENTURES). UNDER THE PREVIOUS STANDARDS, OUR

2005 DEBENTURES WERE RECOGNIZED ENTIRELY AS A LIABILITY AT

HISTORICAL VALUE. IN ACCORDANCE WITH ADOPTING THESE NEW

STANDARDS, IN 2009 WE RETROSPECTIVELY RECOGNIZED BOTH A

LIABILITY AND AN EQUITY COMPONENT OF THE 2005 DEBENTURES AT FAIR

VALUE. THE LIABILITY COMPONENT IS RECOGNIZED AS THE FAIR VALUE

OF A SIMILAR INSTRUMENT THAT DOES NOT HAVE A CONVERSION FEATURE

AT ISSUANCE. THE EQUITY COMPONENT, WHICH IS THE VALUE OF THE

CONVERSION FEATURE AT ISSUANCE, IS RECOGNIZED AS THE DIFFERENCE

BETWEEN THE PROCEEDS FROM THE ISSUANCE OF THE 2005 DEBENTURES

AND THE FAIR VALUE OF THE LIABILITY COMPONENT, AFTER ADJUSTING

FOR THE DEFERRED TAX IMPACT. THE 2005 DEBENTURES WERE ISSUED AT

A COUPON RATE OF 2.95%, WHICH WAS BELOW THAT OF A SIMILAR

INSTRUMENT THAT DID NOT HAVE A CONVERSION FEATURE (6.45%).

THEREFORE, THE VALUATION OF THE DEBT COMPONENT, USING THE INCOME

APPROACH, RESULTED IN A DEBT DISCOUNT. THE DEBT DISCOUNT IS

REDUCED OVER THE EXPECTED LIFE OF THE DEBT, WHICH IS ALSO THE

STATED LIFE OF THE DEBT. THESE NEW STANDARDS ARE ALSO APPLICABLE

IN ACCOUNTING FOR OUR CONVERTIBLE DEBT ISSUED DURING 2009. SEE

NOTE 21: BORROWINGS FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION.

IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2009, WE ADOPTED REVISED STANDARDS FOR

BUSINESS COMBINATIONS. THESE REVISED STANDARDS GENERALLY REQUIRE

AN ENTITY TO RECOGNIZE THE ASSETS, LIABILITIES, CONTINGENCIES,

AND CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION AT THEIR FAIR VALUE ON THE

ACQUISITION DATE. FOR CIRCUMSTANCES IN WHICH THE

ACQUISITION-DATE FAIR VALUE FOR A CONTINGENCY CANNOT BE

DETERMINED DURING THE MEASUREMENT PERIOD AND IT IS CONCLUDED

THAT IT IS PROBABLE THAT AN ASSET OR LIABILITY EXISTS AS OF THE

ACQUISITION DATE AND THE AMOUNT CAN BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED, A

CONTINGENCY IS RECOGNIZED AS OF THE ACQUISITION DATE BASED ON

THE ESTIMATED AMOUNT. THE REVISED STANDARDS FURTHER REQUIRE THAT

ACQUISITION-RELATED COSTS BE RECOGNIZED SEPARATELY FROM THE

ACQUISITION AND EXPENSED AS INCURRED, RESTRUCTURING COSTS

GENERALLY BE EXPENSED IN PERIODS SUBSEQUENT TO THE ACQUISITION

DATE, AND CHANGES IN ESTIMATES FOR ACCOUNTING OF DEFERRED TAX

ASSET VALUATION ALLOWANCES AND ACQUIRED INCOME TAX UNCERTAINTIES

THAT OCCUR SUBSEQUENT TO THE MEASUREMENT PERIOD BE REFLECTED IN

INCOME TAX EXPENSE (BENEFIT). IN ADDITION, ACQUIRED IN-PROCESS

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT IS CAPITALIZED AS AN INTANGIBLE ASSET.

THESE NEW STANDARDS BECAME APPLICABLE TO BUSINESS COMBINATIONS

ON A PROSPECTIVE BASIS BEGINNING IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2009.

OUR ACQUISITIONS COMPLETED DURING 2010 AND 2009 HAVE BEEN

ACCOUNTED FOR USING THESE REVISED STANDARDS. SEE NOTE 15.

IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2009, WE ADOPTED NEW STANDARDS FOR THE

RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT OF

OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY

IMPAIRMENTS FOR DEBT SECURITIES THAT REPLACED THE PRE-EXISTING

INTENT AND ABILITY INDICATOR. THESE NEW STANDARDS

SPECIFY THAT IF THE FAIR VALUE OF A DEBT SECURITY IS LESS THAN

ITS AMORTIZED COST BASIS, AN

OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY

IMPAIRMENT IS TRIGGERED IN CIRCUMSTANCES IN WHICH AN ENTITY HAS

AN INTENT TO SELL THE SECURITY, IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT

THE ENTITY WILL BE REQUIRED TO SELL THE SECURITY BEFORE RECOVERY

OF ITS AMORTIZED COST BASIS, OR THE ENTITY DOES NOT EXPECT TO

RECOVER THE ENTIRE AMORTIZED COST BASIS OF THE SECURITY (THAT

IS, A CREDIT LOSS EXISTS).

OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY

IMPAIRMENTS ARE SEPARATED INTO AMOUNTS REPRESENTING CREDIT

LOSSES, WHICH ARE RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS, AND AMOUNTS RELATED TO

ALL OTHER FACTORS, WHICH ARE RECOGNIZED IN OTHER COMPREHENSIVE

INCOME (LOSS). THE ADOPTION OF THESE NEW STANDARDS DID NOT HAVE

A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION, SEE NOTE 7.

AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE

IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2009, WE ADOPTED AMENDED STANDARDS FOR

THE FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT OF LIABILITIES. THESE AMENDED

STANDARDS CLARIFY THAT IN CIRCUMSTANCES IN WHICH A QUOTED PRICE

IN AN ACTIVE MARKET FOR THE IDENTICAL LIABILITY IS NOT

AVAILABLE, WE ARE REQUIRED TO USE THE QUOTED PRICE OF THE

IDENTICAL LIABILITY WHEN TRADED AS AN ASSET, QUOTED PRICES FOR

SIMILAR LIABILITIES, OR QUOTED PRICES FOR SIMILAR LIABILITIES

WHEN TRADED AS ASSETS. IF THESE QUOTED PRICES ARE NOT AVAILABLE,

WE ARE REQUIRED TO USE ANOTHER VALUATION TECHNIQUE, SUCH AS AN

INCOME APPROACH OR A MARKET APPROACH. THESE AMENDED STANDARDS

BECAME EFFECTIVE FOR US BEGINNING IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2009

AND DID NOT HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON OUR CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

2008

IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2008, WE ADOPTED NEW STANDARDS FOR FAIR

VALUE MEASUREMENTS FOR ALL FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES

RECOGNIZED OR DISCLOSED AT FAIR VALUE IN THE CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ON A RECURRING BASIS (AT LEAST ANNUALLY).

THE STANDARDS DEFINED FAIR VALUE, ESTABLISHED A FRAMEWORK FOR

MEASURING FAIR VALUE, AND ENHANCED FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT

DISCLOSURES. THE ADOPTION OF THESE NEW STANDARDS DID NOT HAVE A

SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, AND

THE RESULTING FAIR VALUES CALCULATED AFTER ADOPTION WERE NOT

SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT FROM THE FAIR VALUES THAT WOULD HAVE

BEEN CALCULATED UNDER PREVIOUS GUIDANCE. AS DISCUSSED ABOVE, WE

ADOPTED THE FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT STANDARDS FOR OUR

NON-FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF

2009. FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION OF OUR FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS, SEE

NOTE 5: FAIR VALUE.

IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2008, WE ADOPTED NEW STANDARDS THAT

PERMITTED COMPANIES TO CHOOSE TO MEASURE CERTAIN FINANCIAL

INSTRUMENTS AND OTHER ITEMS AT FAIR VALUE USING AN

INSTRUMENT-BY-INSTRUMENT

ELECTION. THE NEW STANDARDS REQUIRED UNREALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES

TO BE REPORTED IN EARNINGS FOR ITEMS MEASURED USING THE FAIR

VALUE OPTION. FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION, SEE NOTE 5: FAIR

VALUE. THESE NEW STANDARDS ALSO REQUIRED CASH FLOWS FROM

PURCHASES, SALES, AND MATURITIES OF TRADING SECURITIES TO BE

CLASSIFIED BASED ON THE NATURE AND PURPOSE FOR WHICH THE

SECURITIES WERE ACQUIRED. WE ASSESSED THE NATURE AND PURPOSE OF

OUR TRADING ASSETS AND DETERMINED THAT OUR MARKETABLE DEBT

INSTRUMENTS WILL BE CLASSIFIED ON THE STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS AS

INVESTING ACTIVITIES, AS THEY ARE HELD WITH THE PURPOSE OF

GENERATING RETURNS. ACTIVITY RELATED TO EQUITY SECURITIES

OFFSETTING DEFERRED COMPENSATION REMAINED CLASSIFIED AS

OPERATING ACTIVITIES, AS THEY WERE MAINTAINED TO OFFSET CHANGES

IN LIABILITIES RELATED TO THE EQUITY MARKET RISK OF CERTAIN

DEFERRED COMPENSATION ARRANGEMENTS.

RECENT ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

IN JANUARY 2010, THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD (FASB)

ISSUED AMENDED STANDARDS THAT REQUIRE ADDITIONAL FAIR VALUE

DISCLOSURES. THESE AMENDED STANDARDS REQUIRE DISCLOSURES ABOUT

INPUTS AND VALUATION TECHNIQUES USED TO MEASURE FAIR VALUE, AS

WELL AS DISCLOSURES ABOUT SIGNIFICANT TRANSFERS, BEGINNING IN

THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2010. ADDITIONALLY, THESE AMENDED STANDARDS

REQUIRE PRESENTATION OF DISAGGREGATED ACTIVITY WITHIN THE

RECONCILIATION FOR FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS USING SIGNIFICANT

UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS (LEVEL 3), BEGINNING IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF

2011.

IN OCTOBER 2009, THE FASB ISSUED NEW STANDARDS FOR REVENUE

RECOGNITION WITH MULTIPLE DELIVERABLES. THESE NEW STANDARDS

IMPACT THE DETERMINATION OF WHEN THE INDIVIDUAL DELIVERABLES

INCLUDED IN A MULTIPLE-ELEMENT ARRANGEMENT MAY BE TREATED AS

SEPARATE UNITS OF ACCOUNTING. ADDITIONALLY, THESE NEW STANDARDS

MODIFY THE MANNER IN WHICH THE TRANSACTION CONSIDERATION IS

ALLOCATED ACROSS THE SEPARATELY IDENTIFIED DELIVERABLES BY NO

LONGER PERMITTING THE RESIDUAL METHOD OF ALLOCATING ARRANGEMENT

CONSIDERATION. THESE NEW STANDARDS ARE REQUIRED TO BE ADOPTED IN

THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2011. WE DO NOT EXPECT THESE NEW STANDARDS

TO SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

IN OCTOBER 2009, THE FASB ISSUED NEW STANDARDS FOR THE

ACCOUNTING FOR CERTAIN REVENUE ARRANGEMENTS THAT INCLUDE

SOFTWARE ELEMENTS. THESE NEW STANDARDS AMEND THE SCOPE OF

PRE-EXISTING SOFTWARE REVENUE GUIDANCE BY REMOVING FROM THE

GUIDANCE NON-SOFTWARE COMPONENTS OF TANGIBLE PRODUCTS AND

CERTAIN SOFTWARE COMPONENTS OF TANGIBLE PRODUCTS. THESE NEW

STANDARDS ARE REQUIRED TO BE ADOPTED IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF

2011. WE DO NOT EXPECT THESE NEW STANDARDS TO SIGNIFICANTLY

DEBT INSTRUMENTS

MARKETABLE DEBT INSTRUMENTS INCLUDE INSTRUMENTS SUCH AS

COMMERCIAL PAPER, CORPORATE BONDS, GOVERNMENT BONDS, BANK

DEPOSITS, ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES, MUNICIPAL BONDS, AND MONEY

MARKET FUND DEPOSITS. WHEN WE USE OBSERVABLE MARKET PRICES FOR

IDENTICAL SECURITIES THAT ARE TRADED IN LESS ACTIVE MARKETS, WE

CLASSIFY OUR MARKETABLE DEBT INSTRUMENTS AS LEVEL 2. WHEN

OBSERVABLE MARKET PRICES FOR IDENTICAL SECURITIES ARE NOT

AVAILABLE, WE PRICE OUR MARKETABLE DEBT INSTRUMENTS USING

NON-BINDING MARKET CONSENSUS PRICES THAT ARE CORROBORATED WITH

OBSERVABLE MARKET DATA; QUOTED MARKET PRICES FOR SIMILAR

INSTRUMENTS; OR PRICING MODELS, SUCH AS A DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW

MODEL, WITH ALL SIGNIFICANT INPUTS DERIVED FROM OR CORROBORATED

WITH OBSERVABLE MARKET DATA. NON-BINDING MARKET CONSENSUS PRICES

ARE BASED ON THE PROPRIETARY VALUATION MODELS OF PRICING

PROVIDERS OR BROKERS. THESE VALUATION MODELS INCORPORATE A

NUMBER OF INPUTS, INCLUDING NON-BINDING AND BINDING BROKER

QUOTES; OBSERVABLE MARKET PRICES FOR IDENTICAL OR SIMILAR

SECURITIES; AND THE INTERNAL ASSUMPTIONS OF PRICING PROVIDERS OR

BROKERS THAT USE OBSERVABLE MARKET INPUTS AND, TO A LESSER

DEGREE, UNOBSERVABLE MARKET INPUTS. WE CORROBORATE NON-BINDING

MARKET CONSENSUS PRICES WITH OBSERVABLE MARKET DATA USING

STATISTICAL MODELS WHEN OBSERVABLE MARKET DATA EXISTS. THE

DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW MODEL USES OBSERVABLE MARKET INPUTS, SUCH

AS LIBOR-BASED YIELD CURVES, CURRENCY SPOT AND FORWARD RATES,

AND CREDIT RATINGS.

OUR MARKETABLE DEBT INSTRUMENTS THAT ARE CLASSIFIED AS LEVEL 3

ARE CLASSIFIED AS SUCH DUE TO THE LACK OF OBSERVABLE MARKET DATA

TO CORROBORATE EITHER THE NON-BINDING MARKET CONSENSUS PRICES OR

THE NON-BINDING BROKER QUOTES. WHEN OBSERVABLE MARKET DATA IS

NOT AVAILABLE, WE CORROBORATE NON-BINDING MARKET CONSENSUS

PRICES AND NON-BINDING BROKER QUOTES USING AVAILABLE

UNOBSERVABLE DATA.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

INTEL

CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

FOR ALL PERIODS PRESENTED, GAINS AND LOSSES (REALIZED AND

UNREALIZED) INCLUDED IN EARNINGS WERE PRIMARILY REPORTED IN

INTEREST AND OTHER, NET. DURING 2010 AND 2009, WE TRANSFERRED

CORPORATE BONDS FROM LEVEL 3 TO LEVEL 2 DUE TO A GREATER

AVAILABILITY OF OBSERVABLE MARKET DATA

AND/OR

NON-BINDING MARKET CONSENSUS PRICES TO VALUE OR CORROBORATE THE

VALUE OF THESE INSTRUMENTS. OUR POLICY IS TO REFLECT TRANSFERS

IN AND TRANSFERS OUT AT THE BEGINNING OF THE QUARTER IN WHICH A

CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES RESULTED IN THE TRANSFER.

FAIR

VALUE OPTION FOR FINANCIAL ASSETS/LIABILITIES

WE ELECTED THE FAIR VALUE OPTION FOR LOANS MADE TO THIRD PARTIES

IN 2010 AND 2009 WHEN THE INTEREST RATE OR FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATE

RISK WAS HEDGED AT INCEPTION WITH A RELATED DERIVATIVE

INSTRUMENT. AS OF DECEMBER 25, 2010, THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR LOANS

RECEIVABLE FOR WHICH WE ELECTED THE FAIR VALUE OPTION DID NOT

SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFER FROM THE CONTRACTUAL PRINCIPAL BALANCE

BASED ON THE CONTRACTUAL CURRENCY. THESE LOANS RECEIVABLE ARE

CLASSIFIED WITHIN OTHER LONG-TERM ASSETS. FAIR VALUE IS

DETERMINED USING A DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW MODEL WITH ALL

SIGNIFICANT INPUTS DERIVED FROM OR CORROBORATED WITH OBSERVABLE

MARKET DATA. GAINS AND LOSSES FROM CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE ON THE

LOANS RECEIVABLE AND RELATED DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS, AS WELL AS

INTEREST INCOME, ARE RECORDED IN INTEREST AND OTHER, NET. DURING

2010 AND 2009, CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR LOANS RECEIVABLE

WERE LARGELY OFFSET BY CHANGES IN THE RELATED DERIVATIVE

INSTRUMENTS, RESULTING IN AN INSIGNIFICANT NET IMPACT ON OUR

CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME. GAINS AND LOSSES ATTRIBUTABLE

TO CHANGES IN CREDIT RISK ARE DETERMINED USING OBSERVABLE CREDIT

DEFAULT SPREADS FOR THE ISSUER OR COMPARABLE COMPANIES AND WERE

INSIGNIFICANT DURING 2010 AND 2009. WE DID NOT ELECT THE FAIR

VALUE OPTION FOR LOANS WHEN THE INTEREST RATE OR FOREIGN

EXCHANGE RATE RISK WAS NOT HEDGED AT INCEPTION WITH A RELATED

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENT.

UNDER ACCOUNTING STANDARDS EFFECTIVE IN 2008, ALL OF OUR

NON-CONVERTIBLE LONG-TERM DEBT WAS ELIGIBLE AT INCEPTION TO BE

ACCOUNTED FOR AT FAIR VALUE. HOWEVER, WE ELECTED THIS FAIR VALUE

OPTION ONLY FOR THE BONDS ISSUED IN 2007 BY THE INDUSTRIAL

DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY OF THE CITY OF CHANDLER, ARIZONA (2007

ARIZONA BONDS). IN CONNECTION WITH THE 2007 ARIZONA BONDS, WE

ENTERED INTO A TOTAL RETURN SWAP AGREEMENT THAT EFFECTIVELY

CONVERTS THE FIXED-RATE OBLIGATION ON THE BONDS TO A FLOATING

U.S.-DOLLAR

LIBOR-BASED RATE. AS A RESULT, CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THIS

DEBT ARE LARGELY OFFSET BY CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE

TOTAL RETURN SWAP AGREEMENT, WITHOUT THE NEED TO APPLY HEDGE

ACCOUNTING PROVISIONS. THE 2007 ARIZONA BONDS ARE INCLUDED IN

LONG-TERM DEBT. WE DID NOT ELECT THIS FAIR VALUE OPTION FOR OUR

ARIZONA BONDS ISSUED IN 2005 (2005 ARIZONA BONDS). WE USED

FIXED-RATE DEBT SECURITIES TO OFFSET THE RISK OF CHANGES IN FAIR

VALUE OF THE 2005 ARIZONA BONDS. CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF

THE PURCHASED DEBT SECURITIES WERE REPORTED IN OTHER

COMPREHENSIVE INCOME. ELECTING THE FAIR VALUE OPTION FOR OUR

2005 ARIZONA BONDS WOULD HAVE RESULTED IN CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE

HAVING BEEN RECORDED IN OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS WITHOUT THE

OFFSET FROM CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE OF THE DEBT SECURITIES. AS OF

DECEMBER 25, 2010 AND DECEMBER 26, 2009, NO OTHER INSTRUMENTS

WERE SIMILAR TO THE 2007 ARIZONA BONDS FOR WHICH WE ELECTED FAIR

VALUE TREATMENT.

AS OF DECEMBER 25, 2010, THE FAIR VALUE OF THE 2007 ARIZONA

BONDS DID NOT SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFER FROM THE CONTRACTUAL

PRINCIPAL BALANCE. THE FAIR VALUE OF THE 2007 ARIZONA BONDS WAS

DETERMINED USING INPUTS THAT ARE OBSERVABLE IN THE MARKET OR

THAT CAN BE DERIVED FROM OR CORROBORATED WITH OBSERVABLE MARKET

DATA, AS WELL AS UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS THAT WERE SIGNIFICANT TO

THE FAIR VALUE. GAINS AND LOSSES ON THE 2007 ARIZONA BONDS AND

THE RELATED TOTAL RETURN SWAP ARE RECORDED IN INTEREST AND

OTHER, NET. WE CAPITALIZE INTEREST ASSOCIATED WITH THE 2007

ARIZONA BONDS. WE ADD CAPITALIZED INTEREST TO THE COST OF

QUALIFIED ASSETS AND AMORTIZE IT OVER THE ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES

OF THE ASSETS.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

IN THE PRECEDING TABLES, THE CARRYING VALUE OF OUR IMPAIRED

NON-MARKETABLE EQUITY INVESTMENTS MAY NOT EQUAL OUR FAIR VALUE

MEASUREMENT AT THE TIME OF IMPAIRMENT DUE TO THE SUBSEQUENT

RECOGNITION OF EQUITY METHOD ADJUSTMENTS, AND THE CARRYING VALUE

OF OUR IMPAIRED PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT MAY NOT EQUAL OUR

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT AT THE TIME OF IMPAIRMENT DUE TO THE

SUBSEQUENT RECOGNITION OF DEPRECIATION EXPENSE.

A PORTION OF OUR NON-MARKETABLE EQUITY INVESTMENTS WERE MEASURED

AND RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE DUE TO EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES THAT

SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACTED THE FAIR VALUE OF THOSE INVESTMENTS,

RESULTING IN

OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY

IMPAIRMENT CHARGES. WE CLASSIFIED THESE MEASUREMENTS AS LEVEL 3,

AS WE USED UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS TO THE VALUATION METHODOLOGIES

THAT WERE SIGNIFICANT TO THE FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS, AND THE

VALUATIONS REQUIRED MANAGEMENT JUDGMENT DUE TO THE ABSENCE OF

QUOTED MARKET PRICES. WE DETERMINE THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR

NON-MARKETABLE EQUITY INVESTMENTS USING THE MARKET AND INCOME

APPROACHES. THE MARKET APPROACH INCLUDES THE USE OF FINANCIAL

METRICS AND RATIOS OF COMPARABLE PUBLIC COMPANIES. THE SELECTION

OF COMPARABLE COMPANIES REQUIRES MANAGEMENT JUDGMENT AND IS

BASED ON A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING COMPARABLE

COMPANIES SIZES, GROWTH RATES, INDUSTRIES, DEVELOPMENT

STAGES, AND OTHER RELEVANT FACTORS. THE INCOME APPROACH INCLUDES

THE USE OF A DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW MODEL, WHICH REQUIRES THE

FOLLOWING SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES FOR THE INVESTEE: REVENUE, BASED

ON ASSUMED MARKET SEGMENT SIZE AND ASSUMED MARKET SEGMENT SHARE;

COSTS; AND DISCOUNT RATES BASED ON THE RISK PROFILE OF

COMPARABLE COMPANIES. ESTIMATES OF MARKET SEGMENT SIZE, MARKET

SEGMENT SHARE, AND COSTS ARE DEVELOPED BY THE INVESTEE

AND/OR

INTEL

USING HISTORICAL DATA AND AVAILABLE MARKET DATA. THE VALUATION

OF THESE NON-MARKETABLE EQUITY INVESTMENTS ALSO TAKES INTO

ACCOUNT VARIABLES SUCH AS CONDITIONS REFLECTED IN THE CAPITAL

MARKETS, RECENT FINANCING ACTIVITIES BY THE INVESTEES, THE

INVESTEES CAPITAL STRUCTURE, AND THE TERMS OF THE

INVESTEES ISSUED INTERESTS.

DURING 2008, WE RECORDED A $762 MILLION IMPAIRMENT CHARGE ON OUR

INVESTMENT IN CLEARWIRE COMMUNICATIONS, LLC (CLEARWIRE LLC) TO

WRITE DOWN OUR INVESTMENT TO ITS FAIR VALUE, PRIMARILY DUE TO

THE FAIR VALUE BEING SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER THAN THE COST BASIS OF

OUR INVESTMENT. THE IMPAIRMENT CHARGE WAS INCLUDED IN GAINS

(LOSSES) ON EQUITY METHOD INVESTMENTS, NET. WE DETERMINE THE

FAIR VALUE OF OUR INVESTMENT IN CLEARWIRE LLC PRIMARILY USING

THE QUOTED PRICES FOR ITS PARENT COMPANY, CLEARWIRE CORPORATION.

THE EFFECTS OF ADJUSTING THE QUOTED PRICE FOR PREMIUMS THAT WE

BELIEVE MARKET PARTICIPANTS WOULD CONSIDER FOR CLEARWIRE LLC,

SUCH AS TAX BENEFITS AND VOTING RIGHTS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR

INVESTMENTS, WERE MOSTLY OFFSET BY THE EFFECTS OF DISCOUNTS TO

THE FAIR VALUE, SUCH AS THOSE DUE TO TRANSFER RESTRICTIONS, LACK

OF LIQUIDITY, AND DIFFERENCES IN DIVIDEND RIGHTS THAT ARE

INCLUDED IN THE VALUE OF CLEARWIRE CORPORATION STOCK. WE

CLASSIFIED OUR INVESTMENT IN CLEARWIRE LLC AS LEVEL 2, AS THE

UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS TO THE VALUATION METHODOLOGY WERE NOT

SIGNIFICANT TO THE MEASUREMENT OF FAIR VALUE. FOR FURTHER

INFORMATION ABOUT CLEARWIRE LLC AND CLEARWIRE CORPORATION, SEE

NOTE 11: EQUITY METHOD AND COST METHOD INVESTMENTS.

WE RECORDED A $250 MILLION IMPAIRMENT CHARGE ON OUR INVESTMENT

IN NUMONYX DURING 2008 TO WRITE DOWN OUR INVESTMENT TO ITS FAIR

VALUE. ESTIMATES FOR REVENUE, EARNINGS, AND FUTURE CASH FLOWS

WERE REVISED LOWER DUE TO A GENERAL DECLINE IN THE NOR FLASH

MEMORY MARKET SEGMENT IN 2008. WE MEASURED THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR

INVESTMENT IN NUMONYX USING A COMBINATION OF THE INCOME APPROACH

AND THE MARKET APPROACH. THE INCOME APPROACH INCLUDED THE USE OF

A WEIGHTED AVERAGE OF MULTIPLE DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW SCENARIOS OF

NUMONYX, WHICH REQUIRED THE USE OF UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS,

INCLUDING ASSUMPTIONS OF PROJECTED REVENUE, EXPENSES, CAPITAL

SPENDING, AND OTHER COSTS, AS WELL AS A DISCOUNT RATE CALCULATED

BASED ON THE RISK PROFILE OF THE FLASH MEMORY MARKET SEGMENT

COMPARABLE TO OUR INVESTMENT IN NUMONYX. THE MARKET APPROACH

INCLUDED THE USE OF FINANCIAL METRICS AND RATIOS, SUCH AS

MULTIPLES OF REVENUE AND EARNINGS OF COMPARABLE PUBLIC

COMPANIES. THE IMPAIRMENT CHARGE WAS INCLUDED IN GAINS (LOSSES)

ON EQUITY METHOD INVESTMENTS, NET.

ADDITIONALLY, CERTAIN OF OUR PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT WAS

MEASURED AND RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE DURING 2010 AND 2009 DUE TO

EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES WE IDENTIFIED THAT INDICATED THAT THE

CARRYING VALUE OF THE ASSETS OR THE ASSET GROUPING WAS NOT

RECOVERABLE, RESULTING IN IMPAIRMENT CHARGES. MOST OF THESE

ASSET IMPAIRMENTS RELATED TO MANUFACTURING ASSETS.

OUR NON-MARKETABLE EQUITY INVESTMENTS AS OF DECEMBER 26, 2009

INCLUDED OUR INVESTMENT IN NUMONYX. WE SOLD OUR OWNERSHIP

INTEREST IN NUMONYX TO MICRON IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2010. AS

OF DECEMBER 26, 2009, THE FAIR VALUE WAS BASED ON

MANAGEMENTS ASSESSMENT USING A COMBINATION OF THE INCOME

APPROACH AND THE MARKET APPROACH. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION, SEE

THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR LOANS RECEIVABLE IS DETERMINED USING A

DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

OUR PRIMARY OBJECTIVE FOR HOLDING DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL

INSTRUMENTS IS TO MANAGE CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE RISK AND

INTEREST RATE RISK, AND, TO A LESSER EXTENT, EQUITY MARKET RISK

AND COMMODITY PRICE RISK. WE CURRENTLY DO NOT HOLD DERIVATIVE

INSTRUMENTS FOR THE PURPOSE OF MANAGING CREDIT RISK SINCE WE

LIMIT THE AMOUNT OF CREDIT EXPOSURE TO ANY ONE COUNTERPARTY AND

GENERALLY ENTER INTO DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS WITH

HIGH-CREDIT-QUALITY COUNTERPARTIES.

EXCHANGE RATE RISK

WE ARE EXPOSED TO CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE RISK AND GENERALLY

HEDGE OUR EXPOSURES WITH CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS, CURRENCY

OPTIONS, OR CURRENCY INTEREST RATE SWAPS. SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF

OUR REVENUE AND A MAJORITY OF OUR EXPENSE AND CAPITAL PURCHASING

ACTIVITIES ARE TRANSACTED IN U.S. DOLLARS. HOWEVER, CERTAIN

OPERATING EXPENDITURES AND CAPITAL PURCHASES ARE INCURRED IN OR

EXPOSED TO OTHER CURRENCIES, PRIMARILY THE JAPANESE YEN, THE

EURO, AND THE ISRAELI SHEKEL. WE HAVE ESTABLISHED BALANCE SHEET

AND FORECASTED TRANSACTION CURRENCY RISK MANAGEMENT PROGRAMS TO

PROTECT AGAINST FLUCTUATIONS IN FAIR VALUE AND THE VOLATILITY OF

FUTURE CASH FLOWS CAUSED BY CHANGES IN EXCHANGE RATES. OUR

NON-U.S.-DOLLAR-DENOMINATED

GENERALLY HEDGED WITH OFFSETTING CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS OR

MARKET RISK

OUR MARKETABLE INVESTMENTS INCLUDE MARKETABLE EQUITY SECURITIES

AND EQUITY DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS. TO THE EXTENT THAT OUR

MARKETABLE EQUITY SECURITIES HAVE STRATEGIC VALUE, WE TYPICALLY

DO NOT ATTEMPT TO REDUCE OR ELIMINATE OUR EQUITY MARKET EXPOSURE

THROUGH HEDGING ACTIVITIES. WE MAY ENTER INTO TRANSACTIONS TO

UTILIZE WARRANTS, EQUITY OPTIONS, OR OTHER EQUITY DERIVATIVES.

WE RECOGNIZE CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF SUCH DERIVATIVES IN

GAINS (LOSSES) ON OTHER EQUITY INVESTMENTS, NET. WE ALSO UTILIZE

TOTAL RETURN SWAPS TO OFFSET CHANGES IN LIABILITIES RELATED TO

CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS THAT POTENTIALLY SUBJECT US TO

CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK CONSIST PRINCIPALLY OF INVESTMENTS

IN DEBT INSTRUMENTS, DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, LOANS

RECEIVABLE, AND TRADE RECEIVABLES. WE ENTER INTO MASTER NETTING

ARRANGEMENTS WITH COUNTERPARTIES WHEN POSSIBLE TO MITIGATE

CREDIT RISK IN DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS. A MASTER NETTING

ARRANGEMENT MAY ALLOW COUNTERPARTIES TO NET SETTLE AMOUNTS OWED

TO EACH OTHER AS A RESULT OF MULTIPLE, SEPARATE DERIVATIVE

TRANSACTIONS. FOR PRESENTATION ON OUR CONSOLIDATED BALANCE

SHEETS, WE DO NOT OFFSET FAIR VALUE AMOUNTS RECOGNIZED FOR

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS UNDER MASTER NETTING ARRANGEMENTS.

WE GENERALLY PLACE INVESTMENTS WITH HIGH-CREDIT-QUALITY

COUNTERPARTIES AND, BY POLICY, LIMIT THE AMOUNT OF CREDIT

EXPOSURE TO ANY ONE COUNTERPARTY BASED ON OUR ANALYSIS OF THAT

COUNTERPARTYS RELATIVE CREDIT STANDING. SUBSTANTIALLY ALL

OF OUR INVESTMENTS IN DEBT INSTRUMENTS ARE WITH A/A2 OR BETTER

RATED ISSUERS, AND A SUBSTANTIAL MAJORITY OF THE ISSUERS ARE

RATED AA-/AA3 OR BETTER. OUR INVESTMENT POLICY REQUIRES

SUBSTANTIALLY ALL INVESTMENTS WITH ORIGINAL MATURITIES AT THE

TIME OF INVESTMENT OF UP TO SIX MONTHS TO BE RATED AT LEAST

A-2/P-2

BY

STANDARD & POORS/MOODYS, AND SPECIFIES A HIGHER

MINIMUM RATING FOR INVESTMENTS WITH LONGER MATURITIES. FOR

INSTANCE, INVESTMENTS WITH MATURITIES OF GREATER THAN THREE

YEARS REQUIRE A MINIMUM RATING OF AA-/AA3 AT THE TIME OF

INVESTMENT. GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS IMPOSED ON INVESTMENT

ALTERNATIVES OF OUR

NON-U.S.

SUBSIDIARIES, OR THE ABSENCE OF A RATED COUNTERPARTIES IN

CERTAIN COUNTRIES, RESULT IN SOME MINOR EXCEPTIONS.

CREDIT-RATING CRITERIA FOR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS ARE SIMILAR TO

THOSE FOR OTHER INVESTMENTS. THE AMOUNTS SUBJECT TO CREDIT RISK

RELATED TO DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS ARE GENERALLY LIMITED TO THE

AMOUNTS, IF ANY, BY WHICH THE COUNTERPARTYS OBLIGATIONS

EXCEED OUR OBLIGATIONS WITH THAT COUNTERPARTY. AS OF DECEMBER

25, 2010, THE TOTAL CREDIT EXPOSURE TO ANY SINGLE COUNTERPARTY,

EXCLUDING U.S. TREASURY SECURITIES, DID NOT EXCEED $500 MILLION.

WE OBTAIN AND SECURE AVAILABLE COLLATERAL FROM COUNTERPARTIES

AGAINST OBLIGATIONS, INCLUDING SECURITIES LENDING TRANSACTIONS,

WHEN WE DEEM IT APPROPRIATE.

A SUBSTANTIAL MAJORITY OF OUR TRADE RECEIVABLES ARE DERIVED FROM

SALES TO ORIGINAL EQUIPMENT MANUFACTURERS AND ORIGINAL DESIGN

MANUFACTURERS. WE ALSO HAVE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE DERIVED FROM

SALES TO INDUSTRIAL AND RETAIL DISTRIBUTORS. OUR TWO LARGEST

CUSTOMERS ACCOUNTED FOR 38% OF NET REVENUE FOR 2010, 2009, AND

2008. ADDITIONALLY, THESE TWO LARGEST CUSTOMERS ACCOUNTED FOR

44% OF OUR ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AS OF DECEMBER 25, 2010 AND 41%

OF OUR ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AS OF DECEMBER 26, 2009. WE BELIEVE

THAT THE RECEIVABLE BALANCES FROM THESE LARGEST CUSTOMERS DO NOT

REPRESENT A SIGNIFICANT CREDIT RISK BASED ON CASH FLOW

FORECASTS, BALANCE SHEET ANALYSIS, AND PAST COLLECTION

EXPERIENCE.

WE HAVE ADOPTED CREDIT POLICIES AND STANDARDS INTENDED TO

ACCOMMODATE INDUSTRY GROWTH AND INHERENT RISK. WE BELIEVE THAT

CREDIT RISKS ARE MODERATED BY THE FINANCIAL STABILITY OF OUR

MAJOR CUSTOMERS. WE ASSESS CREDIT RISK THROUGH QUANTITATIVE AND

QUALITATIVE ANALYSIS, AND FROM THIS ANALYSIS, WE ESTABLISH

CREDIT LIMITS AND DETERMINE WHETHER WE WILL SEEK TO USE ONE OR

MORE CREDIT SUPPORT DEVICES, SUCH AS OBTAINING SOME FORM OF

THIRD-PARTY GUARANTEE OR STANDBY LETTER OF CREDIT, OR OBTAINING

CREDIT INSURANCE FOR ALL OR A PORTION OF THE ACCOUNT BALANCE IF

2011. INTEL HAS MADE LIMITED ADDITIONAL INVESTMENTS IN 2010,

RESULTING IN THE DECLINE OF OUR OWNERSHIP INTEREST IN IMFS FROM

49% AS OF DECEMBER 26, 2009. WE WILL ASSESS ANY ADDITIONAL

INVESTMENTS IN IMFS BASED ON MARKET CONDITIONS. IMFT AND IMFS

ARE EACH GOVERNED BY A BOARD OF MANAGERS, WITH MICRON AND INTEL

INITIALLY APPOINTING AN EQUAL NUMBER OF MANAGERS TO EACH OF THE

BOARDS. THE NUMBER OF MANAGERS APPOINTED BY EACH PARTY ADJUSTS

DEPENDING ON THE PARTIES OWNERSHIP INTERESTS. AS A RESULT

OF THE REDUCTION OF OUR OWNERSHIP INTEREST IN IMFS, MICRON NOW

APPOINTS THE MAJORITY OF THE MANAGERS ON THE IMFS BOARD. THESE

VENTURES WILL OPERATE UNTIL 2016 BUT ARE SUBJECT TO EARLIER

TERMINATION UNDER CERTAIN TERMS AND CONDITIONS.

CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

THESE JOINT VENTURES ARE VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES. ALL COSTS

OF THE JOINT VENTURES WILL BE PASSED ON TO MICRON AND INTEL

THROUGH OUR PURCHASE AGREEMENTS. IMFT AND IMFS ARE DEPENDENT

UPON MICRON AND INTEL FOR ANY ADDITIONAL CASH REQUIREMENTS. OUR

KNOWN MAXIMUM EXPOSURE TO LOSS APPROXIMATED OUR INVESTMENT

BALANCE IN IMFT/IMFS AS OF DECEMBER 25, 2010. OUR INVESTMENT IN

THESE VENTURES IS CLASSIFIED WITHIN OTHER LONG-TERM ASSETS. AS

OF DECEMBER 25, 2010, EXCEPT FOR THE AMOUNT DUE TO IMFT/IMFS FOR

PRODUCT PURCHASES AND SERVICES, WE DID NOT INCUR ANY ADDITIONAL

LIABILITIES IN CONNECTION WITH OUR INTERESTS IN THESE JOINT

VENTURES. IN ADDITION TO THE POTENTIAL LOSS OF OUR EXISTING

INVESTMENT, OUR ACTUAL LOSSES COULD BE HIGHER, AS INTEL AND

MICRON ARE LIABLE FOR OTHER FUTURE OPERATING COSTS OR

OBLIGATIONS OF IMFT/IMFS. IN ADDITION, FUTURE CASH CALLS COULD

INCREASE OUR INVESTMENT BALANCE AND THE RELATED EXPOSURE TO

LOSS. FINALLY, AS WE ARE CURRENTLY COMMITTED TO PURCHASING 49%

OF IMFTS AND 47% OF IMFSS PRODUCTION OUTPUT AND

PRODUCTION-RELATED SERVICES, WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO PURCHASE

PRODUCTS AT A COST IN EXCESS OF REALIZABLE VALUE. OUR

CONTRACTUAL COMMITMENT TO PURCHASE PRODUCT OUTPUT AND FUND

PRODUCTION-RELATED SERVICES ADJUSTS TO CHANGES IN OUR OWNERSHIP

PERCENTAGE ON A ONE-YEAR LAG.

OUR PORTION OF IMFT COSTS, PRIMARILY RELATED TO PRODUCT

PURCHASES AND PRODUCTION-RELATED SERVICES, WAS APPROXIMATELY

$735 MILLION DURING 2010 AND 2009 (APPROXIMATELY $1.1 BILLION

DURING 2008). THE AMOUNT DUE TO IMFT FOR PRODUCT PURCHASES AND

SERVICES PROVIDED WAS APPROXIMATELY $95 MILLION AS OF DECEMBER

25, 2010 (APPROXIMATELY $75 MILLION AS OF DECEMBER 26, 2009).

DURING 2010, $197 MILLION WAS RETURNED TO INTEL BY IMFT, WHICH

IS REFLECTED AS A RETURN OF EQUITY METHOD INVESTMENT WITHIN

INVESTING ACTIVITIES ON THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH

FLOWS ($419 MILLION DURING 2009 AND $298 MILLION DURING 2008).

IN 2010, IMFT INCREASED ITS CAPITAL EXPENDITURES COMPARED TO

2009. THE CASH USED FOR THOSE CAPITAL EXPENDITURES REDUCED THE

AMOUNT OF CASH PROVIDED BY IMFT TO US AS A RETURN OF EQUITY

METHOD INVESTMENT IN 2010.

UNDER THE ACCOUNTING STANDARDS FOR CONSOLIDATING VARIABLE

INTEREST ENTITIES, THE CONSOLIDATING INVESTOR IS THE ENTITY WITH

THE POWER TO DIRECT THE ACTIVITIES OF THE VENTURE THAT MOST

SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT THE VENTURES ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE AND

WITH THE OBLIGATION TO ABSORB LOSSES OR THE RIGHT TO RECEIVE

BENEFITS FROM THE VENTURE THAT COULD POTENTIALLY BE SIGNIFICANT

TO THE VENTURE. WE HAVE DETERMINED THAT WE DO NOT HAVE BOTH OF

THESE CHARACTERISTICS AND, THEREFORE, WE ACCOUNT FOR OUR

INTERESTS USING THE EQUITY METHOD OF ACCOUNTING.

CLEARWIRE

COMMUNICATIONS, LLC

IN 2008, WE INVESTED $1.0 BILLION IN CLEARWIRE LLC, A WHOLLY

OWNED SUBSIDIARY OF CLEARWIRE CORPORATION. IN THE FOURTH QUARTER

OF 2009, WE INVESTED AN ADDITIONAL $50 MILLION. OUR INVESTMENT

IN CLEARWIRE LLC IS ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER THE EQUITY METHOD OF

ACCOUNTING, AND OUR PROPORTIONATE SHARE OF THE INCOME OR LOSS IS

RECOGNIZED ON A ONE-QUARTER LAG. DURING 2010, WE RECOGNIZED $116

MILLION OF EQUITY METHOD LOSSES. DURING 2009, WE RECORDED $27

MILLION OF EQUITY METHOD LOSSES, WHICH WAS NET OF A GAIN OF $37

MILLION AS A RESULT OF A DILUTION OF OUR OWNERSHIP INTEREST FROM

THE ADDITIONAL INVESTMENT. DUE TO THE ONE-QUARTER LAG, WE DID

NOT RECORD EQUITY METHOD ADJUSTMENTS RELATED TO CLEARWIRE LLC

DURING 2008. DURING 2008, WE RECORDED A $762 MILLION IMPAIRMENT

CHARGE ON OUR INVESTMENT IN CLEARWIRE LLC TO WRITE DOWN OUR

INVESTMENT TO ITS FAIR VALUE. THE IMPAIRMENT CHARGE WAS INCLUDED

IN GAINS (LOSSES) ON EQUITY METHOD INVESTMENTS, NET. FOR FURTHER

AS OF DECEMBER 25, 2010, OUR INVESTMENT BALANCE IN CLEARWIRE LLC

WAS $145 MILLION AND IS CLASSIFIED WITHIN OTHER LONG-TERM ASSETS

THE CARRYING VALUE OF OUR INVESTMENT IN CLEARWIRE LLC WAS $297

MILLION BELOW OUR SHARE OF THE BOOK VALUE OF THE NET ASSETS OF

CLEARWIRE CORPORATION, AND A SUBSTANTIAL MAJORITY OF THIS

DIFFERENCE HAS BEEN ATTRIBUTED TO CLEARWIRE CORPORATIONS

SPECTRUM ASSETS, A MAJORITY OF WHICH HAVE AN INDEFINITE LIFE.

ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER THE EQUITY METHOD OF ACCOUNTING, AND OUR

PROPORTIONATE SHARE OF THE INCOME OR LOSS WAS RECOGNIZED ON A

INFINEON TECHNOLOGIES AG

ON JANUARY 31, 2011, WE COMPLETED THE ACQUISITION OF THE

WIRELESS SOLUTIONS (WLS) BUSINESS OF INFINEON. TOTAL NET CASH

CONSIDERATION TO ACQUIRE THE WLS BUSINESS IS ESTIMATED AT $1.4

BILLION. THE ACQUIRED BUSINESS WILL OPERATE AS INTEL MOBILE

COMMUNICATIONS AND OFFER MOBILE PHONE COMPONENTS SUCH AS

BASEBAND PROCESSORS, RADIO FREQUENCY TRANSCEIVERS, AND POWER

MANAGEMENT CHIPS. THE OBJECTIVE OF THE ACQUISITION IS TO PROVIDE

SOLUTIONS THAT ENABLE A BROAD RANGE OF COMPUTING APPLICATIONS TO

HAVE WIRELESS CONNECTIVITY.

DUE TO THE RELATIVELY SHORT TIME FROM THE DATE OF ACQUISITION TO

THE COMPLETION OF THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, THE INITIAL

ACCOUNTING FOR THE ACQUISITION IS NOT COMPLETE. THE PRELIMINARY

EVALUATION OF THE FAIR VALUE FOR CERTAIN SIGNIFICANT ASSETS AND

LIABILITIES, INCLUDING GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLES, IS NOT

COMPLETE. THE GOODWILL RECOGNIZED IS EXPECTED TO BE DEDUCTIBLE

FOR TAX PURPOSES. SINCE THE PRO FORMA REVENUE AND EARNINGS ARE

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

AT THE END OF 2009, WE REORGANIZED OUR BUSINESS TO BETTER ALIGN

OUR MAJOR PRODUCT GROUPS AROUND THE CORE COMPETENCIES OF INTEL

ARCHITECTURE AND OUR MANUFACTURING OPERATIONS. DUE TO THIS

REORGANIZATION, GOODWILL WAS ALLOCATED FROM OUR PRIOR OPERATING

SEGMENTS TO OUR NEW OPERATING SEGMENTS, AS SHOWN IN THE

PRECEDING TABLE UNDER TRANSFERS. THE ALLOCATION WAS BASED ON THE

FAIR VALUE OF EACH BUSINESS GROUP WITHIN ITS ORIGINAL OPERATING

SEGMENT RELATIVE TO THE FAIR VALUE OF THAT OPERATING SEGMENT.

DURING 2009, PRIOR TO OUR REORGANIZATION, WE COMPLETED TWO

ACQUISITIONS, INCLUDING THE ACQUISITION OF WIND RIVER SYSTEMS

(SEE NOTE 15: ACQUISITIONS FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION).

GOODWILL RECOGNIZED FROM THE WIND RIVER SYSTEMS ACQUISITION WAS

ASSIGNED TO OUR DIGITAL ENTERPRISE GROUP, OUR MOBILITY GROUP,

OUR DIGITAL HOME GROUP, AND OUR WIND RIVER SOFTWARE GROUP BASED

ON THE RELATIVE EXPECTED FAIR VALUE PROVIDED BY THE ACQUISITION.

OUR WIND RIVER SOFTWARE GROUP IS INCLUDED IN THE OTHER OPERATING

SEGMENTS CATEGORY IN THE PRECEDING TABLE, WHILE OUR DIGITAL HOME

GROUP IS INCLUDED IN THE OTHER INTEL ARCHITECTURE OPERATING

SEGMENTS CATEGORY. THE ASSIGNMENT OF GOODWILL TO OUR DIGITAL

ENTERPRISE GROUP, OUR MOBILITY GROUP, AND OUR DIGITAL HOME GROUP

WAS BASED ON THE PROPORTIONATE BENEFITS EXPECTED TO BE GENERATED

FOR EACH GROUP RESULTING FROM ENHANCED MARKET PRESENCE FOR

EXISTING BUSINESSES.

DURING 2010, WE COMPLETED THREE ACQUISITIONS. THE GOODWILL

RECOGNIZED FROM THESE ACQUISITIONS WAS ASSIGNED TO OUR DIGITAL

HOME GROUP, OUR SOFTWARE AND SERVICES GROUP, OUR ULTRA-MOBILITY

GROUP, OUR PC CLIENT GROUP, AND OUR EMBEDDED AND COMMUNICATIONS

GROUP. OUR SOFTWARE AND SERVICES GROUP IS INCLUDED IN THE OTHER

OPERATING SEGMENTS CATEGORY IN THE PRECEDING TABLE, WHILE OUR

DIGITAL HOME GROUP, OUR ULTRA-MOBILITY GROUP, AND OUR EMBEDDED

AND COMMUNICATIONS GROUP ARE ALL INCLUDED IN THE OTHER INTEL

ARCHITECTURE OPERATING SEGMENTS CATEGORY.

AFTER COMPLETING OUR ANNUAL IMPAIRMENT REVIEWS DURING THE FOURTH

QUARTER OF 2010, 2009, AND 2008, WE CONCLUDED THAT GOODWILL WAS

NOT IMPAIRED IN ANY OF THESE YEARS. AS OF DECEMBER 25, 2010,

ACCUMULATED IMPAIRMENT LOSSES IN TOTAL WERE $713 MILLION: $355

MILLION ASSOCIATED WITH OUR PC CLIENT GROUP, $279 MILLION

ASSOCIATED WITH OUR DATA CENTER GROUP, AND $79 MILLION

NAND PLAN

IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2008, MANAGEMENT APPROVED A PLAN WITH

MICRON TO DISCONTINUE THE SUPPLY OF NAND FLASH MEMORY FROM THE

200MM FACILITY WITHIN THE IMFT MANUFACTURING NETWORK. THE

AGREEMENT RESULTED IN A $215 MILLION RESTRUCTURING CHARGE,

PRIMARILY RELATED TO THE IMFT 200MM SUPPLY AGREEMENT. THE

RESTRUCTURING CHARGE RESULTED IN A REDUCTION OF OUR INVESTMENT

IN IMFT/IMFS OF $184 MILLION, A CASH PAYMENT TO MICRON OF $24

MILLION, AND OTHER CASH PAYMENTS OF $7 MILLION. THE 2008 NAND

PLAN WAS COMPLETED AT THE END OF 2008.

DURING 2006, AS PART OF OUR ASSESSMENT OF OUR WORLDWIDE

MANUFACTURING CAPACITY OPERATIONS, WE PLACED FOR SALE OUR

FABRICATION FACILITY IN COLORADO SPRINGS, COLORADO. AS A RESULT

OF PLACING THE FACILITY FOR SALE, IN 2006 WE RECORDED A $214

MILLION IMPAIRMENT CHARGE TO WRITE DOWN TO FAIR VALUE THE LAND,

BUILDING, AND EQUIPMENT. WE INCURRED $54 MILLION IN ADDITIONAL

ASSET IMPAIRMENT CHARGES AS A RESULT OF MARKET CONDITIONS

RELATED TO THE COLORADO SPRINGS FACILITY DURING 2007 AND

ADDITIONAL CHARGES IN 2008. WE SOLD THE COLORADO SPRINGS

FACILITY IN 2009.

WE INCURRED $85 MILLION IN ASSET IMPAIRMENT CHARGES RELATED TO

ASSETS THAT WE SOLD IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE DIVESTITURE OF OUR

NOR FLASH MEMORY BUSINESS IN 2007, AND AN ADDITIONAL $275

MILLION IN 2008. WE DETERMINED THE IMPAIRMENT CHARGES BASED ON

THE FAIR VALUE, LESS SELLING COSTS, THAT WE EXPECTED TO RECEIVE

UPON COMPLETION OF THE DIVESTITURE IN 2007, AND DETERMINED THE

IMPAIRMENT CHARGES BASED ON THE REVISED FAIR VALUE OF THE EQUITY

AND NOTE RECEIVABLE THAT WE RECEIVED UPON COMPLETION OF THE

DIVESTITURE, LESS SELLING COSTS, IN 2008. FOR FURTHER

CHIPSET DESIGN ISSUE

IN JANUARY 2011, AS PART OF OUR ONGOING QUALITY ASSURANCE

PROCEDURES, WE IDENTIFIED A DESIGN ISSUE WITH THE

INTEL

®

6 SERIES EXPRESS CHIPSET FAMILY (FORMERLY CODE-NAMED COUGAR

POINT). THE ISSUE AFFECTED CHIPSETS SOLD IN THE FOURTH QUARTER

OF 2010 AND JANUARY 2011. WE SUBSEQUENTLY IMPLEMENTED A SILICON

FIX, AND BEGAN SHIPPING THE UPDATED VERSION OF THE AFFECTED

CHIPSET IN FEBRUARY 2011. WE ESTIMATE THAT THE TOTAL COST TO

REPAIR AND REPLACE AFFECTED MATERIALS AND SYSTEMS, LOCATED WITH

CUSTOMERS AND IN THE MARKET, WILL BE APPROXIMATELY $660 MILLION.

WE RECORDED A CHARGE OF $311 MILLION IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF

2010, WHICH COMPRISED $67 MILLION IN PRODUCT COSTS FOR THE

AFFECTED CHIPSETS AND $244 MILLION TO ESTABLISH A PRODUCT

ACCRUAL FOR THIS ISSUE. WE EXPECT TO RECOGNIZE AN ADDITIONAL

CHARGE OF APPROXIMATELY $350 MILLION IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF

2011, PRIMARILY RELATED TO AN ADDITIONAL PRODUCT ACCRUAL FOR THE

ESTIMATED COSTS TO REPAIR AND REPLACE AFFECTED MATERIALS AND

SYSTEMS ASSOCIATED WITH PRODUCTS SOLD IN JANUARY 2011. THE

CHARGES INCURRED IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2010 ARE REFLECTED IN

THE RESULTS OF THE PC CLIENT GROUP OPERATING SEGMENT.

BOTH THE 2009 AND 2005 DEBENTURES ARE CONVERTIBLE, SUBJECT TO

CERTAIN CONDITIONS, INTO SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK. HOLDERS CAN

SURRENDER THE 2009 DEBENTURES FOR CONVERSION IF THE CLOSING

PRICE OF INTEL COMMON STOCK HAS BEEN AT LEAST 130% OF THE

CONVERSION PRICE THEN IN EFFECT FOR AT LEAST 20 TRADING DAYS

DURING THE 30 CONSECUTIVE

TRADING-DAY

PERIOD ENDING ON THE LAST TRADING DAY OF THE PRECEDING FISCAL

QUARTER. HOLDERS CAN SURRENDER THE 2005 DEBENTURES FOR

CONVERSION AT ANY TIME. WE WILL SETTLE ANY CONVERSION OR

REPURCHASE OF THE 2009 DEBENTURES IN CASH UP TO THE FACE VALUE,

AND ANY AMOUNT IN EXCESS OF FACE VALUE WILL BE SETTLED IN CASH

OR STOCK AT OUR OPTION. HOWEVER, WE CAN SETTLE ANY CONVERSION OR

REPURCHASE OF THE 2005 DEBENTURES IN CASH OR STOCK AT OUR

OPTION. ON OR AFTER AUGUST 5, 2019, WE CAN REDEEM, FOR CASH, ALL

OR PART OF THE 2009 DEBENTURES FOR THE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT, PLUS

ANY ACCRUED AND UNPAID INTEREST, IF THE CLOSING PRICE OF INTEL

COMMON STOCK HAS BEEN AT LEAST 150% OF THE CONVERSION PRICE THEN

IN EFFECT FOR AT LEAST 20 TRADING DAYS DURING ANY 30 CONSECUTIVE

INDENTURES GOVERNING THE 2009 AND 2005 DEBENTURES PROVIDE THAT

EACH HOLDER OF THE DEBENTURES CAN, FOR A PRE-DEFINED PERIOD OF

TIME, REQUIRE US TO REPURCHASE THE HOLDERS DEBENTURES FOR

THE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT PLUS ANY ACCRUED AND UNPAID INTEREST. BOTH

THE 2009 AND 2005 DEBENTURES ARE SUBORDINATED IN RIGHT OF

INSTRUMENTS AND THAT THE EMBEDDED STOCK CONVERSION OPTIONS

QUALIFY AS DERIVATIVES. IN ADDITION, WE HAVE CONCLUDED THAT THE

ARIZONA

BONDS

IN 2007, WE GUARANTEED REPAYMENT OF PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST ON

BONDS ISSUED BY THE INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY OF THE CITY

OF CHANDLER, ARIZONA, WHICH CONSTITUTE AN UNSECURED GENERAL

OBLIGATION FOR INTEL. THE AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF THE

BONDS ISSUED IN DECEMBER 2007 IS $125 MILLION DUE IN 2037, AND

THE BONDS BEAR INTEREST AT A FIXED RATE OF 5.3%. THE 2007

ARIZONA BONDS ARE SUBJECT TO MANDATORY TENDER, AT OUR OPTION, ON

ANY INTEREST PAYMENT DATE BEGINNING ON OR AFTER DECEMBER 1, 2012

UNTIL THEIR FINAL MATURITY ON DECEMBER 1, 2037. UPON SUCH

TENDER, WE CAN RE-MARKET THE BONDS AS EITHER FIXED-RATE BONDS

FOR A SPECIFIED PERIOD OR AS VARIABLE-RATE BONDS UNTIL THEIR

FINAL MATURITY. WE ALSO ENTERED INTO A TOTAL RETURN SWAP

AGREEMENT THAT EFFECTIVELY CONVERTS THE FIXED-RATE OBLIGATION ON

THE BONDS TO A FLOATING

U.S.-DOLLAR

LIBOR-BASED RATE. WE HAVE ELECTED TO ACCOUNT FOR THE 2007

ARIZONA BONDS AT FAIR VALUE. FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION, SEE

NOTE 5: FAIR VALUE.

IN 2005, WE GUARANTEED REPAYMENT OF PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST ON

BONDS ISSUED BY THE INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY OF THE CITY

OF CHANDLER, ARIZONA, WHICH CONSTITUTES AN UNSECURED GENERAL

OBLIGATION FOR INTEL. THE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT, EXCLUDING THE

PREMIUM, OF THE BONDS ISSUED IN 2005 WAS $157 MILLION. THE 2005

ARIZONA BONDS WERE MANDATORILY TENDERED AND REPAID ON NOVEMBER

30, 2010. THE BONDS BORE INTEREST AT A FIXED RATE OF 4.375%. IN

RETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS

RETIREMENT

CONTRIBUTION PLANS

WE PROVIDE TAX-QUALIFIED RETIREMENT CONTRIBUTION PLANS FOR THE

BENEFIT OF ELIGIBLE EMPLOYEES, FORMER EMPLOYEES, AND RETIREES IN

THE U.S. AND CERTAIN OTHER COUNTRIES. THE PLANS, WHICH ARE

FUNDED BY ANNUAL DISCRETIONARY CONTRIBUTIONS FROM INTEL, ARE

DESIGNED TO PROVIDE EMPLOYEES WITH AN ACCUMULATION OF FUNDS FOR

RETIREMENT ON A TAX-DEFERRED BASIS. OUR CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER

(CEO) DETERMINES THE AMOUNTS TO BE CONTRIBUTED TO THE U.S. INTEL

RETIREMENT CONTRIBUTION PLAN, FORMERLY KNOWN AS THE U.S. PROFIT

SHARING PLAN, UNDER DELEGATION OF AUTHORITY FROM OUR BOARD OF

DIRECTORS, PURSUANT TO THE TERMS OF THE U.S. INTEL RETIREMENT

CONTRIBUTION PLAN. AS OF DECEMBER 25, 2010, 56% OF OUR U.S.

INTEL RETIREMENT CONTRIBUTION PLAN WAS INVESTED IN EQUITIES, 38%

WAS INVESTED IN FIXED-INCOME INSTRUMENTS, AND 6% WAS INVESTED IN

REAL ASSETS. A SUBSTANTIAL MAJORITY OF ASSETS ARE MANAGED BY

EXTERNAL INVESTMENT MANAGERS.

FOR THE BENEFIT OF ELIGIBLE U.S. EMPLOYEES, WE ALSO PROVIDE A

NON-TAX-QUALIFIED SUPPLEMENTAL DEFERRED COMPENSATION PLAN FOR

CERTAIN HIGHLY COMPENSATED EMPLOYEES. THIS PLAN IS DESIGNED TO

PERMIT CERTAIN DISCRETIONARY EMPLOYER CONTRIBUTIONS AND TO

PERMIT EMPLOYEE DEFERRAL OF A PORTION OF COMPENSATION IN

ADDITION TO THEIR INTEL 401(K) SAVINGS PLAN DEFERRALS. THIS PLAN

IS UNFUNDED.

WE EXPENSED $319 MILLION FOR THE QUALIFIED AND NON-QUALIFIED

U.S. INTEL RETIREMENT CONTRIBUTION PLAN IN 2010 ($260 MILLION IN

2009 AND $289 MILLION IN 2008). IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2011, WE

FUNDED $297 MILLION FOR THE 2010 CONTRIBUTION TO THE QUALIFIED

U.S. INTEL RETIREMENT CONTRIBUTION PLAN.

PENSION

AND POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS

U.S. PENSION BENEFITS.

WE PROVIDE A TAX-QUALIFIED

DEFINED-BENEFIT PENSION PLAN, THE U.S. INTEL MINIMUM PENSION

PLAN, FOR THE BENEFIT OF ELIGIBLE EMPLOYEES, FORMER EMPLOYEES,

AND RETIREES IN THE U.S. THE U.S. INTEL MINIMUM PENSION PLAN

BENEFIT IS DETERMINED BY A PARTICIPANTS YEARS OF SERVICE

AND FINAL AVERAGE COMPENSATION (TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE

PARTICIPANTS SOCIAL SECURITY WAGE BASE), REDUCED BY THE

PARTICIPANTS BALANCE IN THE U.S. INTEL RETIREMENT

CONTRIBUTION PLAN (WHICH IS FUNDED BY DISCRETIONARY EMPLOYER

CONTRIBUTIONS). THE PLAN GENERATES A MINIMUM PENSION BENEFIT IF

THE PARTICIPANTS U.S. INTEL MINIMUM PENSION PLAN BENEFIT

EXCEEDS THE ANNUITIZED VALUE OF HIS OR HER U.S. INTEL RETIREMENT

CONTRIBUTION PLAN BENEFIT. IF PARTICIPANT BALANCES IN THE U.S.

INTEL RETIREMENT CONTRIBUTION PLAN DO NOT GROW SUFFICIENTLY, THE

PROJECTED BENEFIT OBLIGATION OF THE U.S. INTEL MINIMUM PENSION

PLAN COULD INCREASE SIGNIFICANTLY.

AS OF JANUARY 1, 2011 (THE EFFECTIVE DATE), INTEL CLOSED ITS

U.S. INTEL MINIMUM PENSION PLAN AND U.S. INTEL RETIREMENT

CONTRIBUTION PLAN TO EMPLOYEES HIRED ON OR AFTER THE EFFECTIVE

DATE. EMPLOYEES HIRED ON OR AFTER THE EFFECTIVE DATE WILL

RECEIVE DISCRETIONARY EMPLOYER CONTRIBUTIONS VIA THE INTEL

401(K) SAVINGS PLAN.

NON-U.S.

PENSION BENEFITS.

WE ALSO PROVIDE DEFINED-BENEFIT PENSION

PLANS IN CERTAIN OTHER COUNTRIES. CONSISTENT WITH THE

REQUIREMENTS OF LOCAL LAW, WE DEPOSIT FUNDS FOR CERTAIN PLANS

WITH INSURANCE COMPANIES, WITH THIRD-PARTY TRUSTEES, OR INTO

GOVERNMENT-MANAGED ACCOUNTS,

AND/OR

ACCRUE FOR THE UNFUNDED PORTION OF THE OBLIGATION.

U.S. POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL BENEFITS.

UPON RETIREMENT,

ELIGIBLE U.S. EMPLOYEES ARE CREDITED WITH A DEFINED DOLLAR

AMOUNT, BASED ON YEARS OF SERVICE, INTO A U.S. SHELTERED

EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT MEDICAL ACCOUNT (SERMA). IN 2010, WE

APPROVED A PLAN AMENDMENT, EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2011, TO

EXPAND USE OF THESE CREDITS TO PAY ALL OR A PORTION OF THE COST

TO PURCHASE COVERAGE IN THE RETIREES CHOICE OF MEDICAL

PLAN. PRIOR TO 2011, THESE CREDITS COULD ONLY BE USED TO PAY ALL

OR A PORTION OF THE COST TO PURCHASE COVERAGE IN AN

INTEL-SPONSORED MEDICAL PLAN. IF THE AVAILABLE CREDITS ARE NOT

SUFFICIENT TO PAY THE ENTIRE COST OF THE COVERAGE, THE REMAINING

COST IS THE RETIREES RESPONSIBILITY.

FUNDING POLICY.

OUR PRACTICE IS TO FUND THE VARIOUS

PENSION PLANS AND THE U.S. POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL BENEFITS PLAN

IN AMOUNTS SUFFICIENT TO MEET THE MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS OF U.S.

FEDERAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS OR APPLICABLE LOCAL LAWS AND

REGULATIONS. ADDITIONAL FUNDING MAY BE PROVIDED AS DEEMED

APPROPRIATE. DEPENDING ON THE DESIGN OF THE PLAN, LOCAL CUSTOMS,

AND MARKET CIRCUMSTANCES, THE LIABILITIES OF A PLAN MAY EXCEED

QUALIFIED PLAN ASSETS.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

FOR THE U.S. PLANS, WE DEVELOPED THE DISCOUNT RATE BY

CALCULATING THE BENEFIT PAYMENT STREAMS BY YEAR TO DETERMINE

WHEN BENEFIT PAYMENTS WILL BE DUE. WE THEN MATCHED THE BENEFIT

PAYMENT STREAMS BY YEAR TO THE AA CORPORATE BOND RATES TO MATCH

THE TIMING AND AMOUNT OF THE EXPECTED BENEFIT PAYMENTS AND

DISCOUNTED BACK TO THE MEASUREMENT DATE TO DETERMINE THE

APPROPRIATE DISCOUNT RATE. FOR THE

NON-U.S.

PLANS, WE USED TWO APPROACHES TO DEVELOP THE DISCOUNT RATE. IN

CERTAIN COUNTRIES, WE USED A MODEL CONSISTING OF A THEORETICAL

BOND PORTFOLIO FOR WHICH THE TIMING AND AMOUNT OF CASH FLOWS

APPROXIMATED THE ESTIMATED BENEFIT PAYMENTS OF OUR PENSION

PLANS. IN OTHER COUNTRIES, WE ANALYZED CURRENT MARKET LONG-TERM

BOND RATES AND MATCHED THE BOND MATURITY WITH THE AVERAGE

DURATION OF THE PENSION LIABILITIES. THE EXPECTED LONG-TERM RATE

OF RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS ASSUMPTIONS TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION

BOTH DURATION AND RISK OF THE INVESTMENT PORTFOLIOS, AND ARE

DEVELOPED THROUGH CONSENSUS AND BUILDING-BLOCK METHODOLOGIES.

THE CONSENSUS METHODOLOGY INCLUDES UNADJUSTED ESTIMATES BY THE

FUND MANAGER ON FUTURE MARKET EXPECTATIONS BY BROAD ASSET

CLASSES AND GEOGRAPHY. THE BUILDING-BLOCK APPROACH DETERMINES

THE RATES OF RETURN IMPLIED BY HISTORICAL RISK PREMIUMS ACROSS

ASSET CLASSES. IN ADDITION, WE ANALYZED RATES OF RETURN RELEVANT

TO THE COUNTRY WHERE EACH PLAN IS IN EFFECT AND THE INVESTMENTS

APPLICABLE TO THE PLAN, EXPECTATIONS OF FUTURE RETURNS, LOCAL

ACTUARIAL PROJECTIONS, AND THE PROJECTED LONG-TERM RATES OF

RETURN FROM EXTERNAL INVESTMENT MANAGERS. THE EXPECTED LONG-TERM

RATE OF RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS SHOWN FOR THE

NON-U.S.

PLAN ASSETS IS WEIGHTED TO REFLECT EACH COUNTRYS RELATIVE

PORTION OF THE

NON-U.S.

PLAN ASSETS.

PENSION PLAN ASSETS

IN GENERAL, THE INVESTMENT STRATEGY FOR U.S. INTEL MINIMUM

PENSION PLAN ASSETS IS TO MAXIMIZE RISK-ADJUSTED RETURNS, TAKING

INTO CONSIDERATION THE INVESTMENT HORIZON AND EXPECTED

VOLATILITY, TO ENSURE THAT THERE ARE SUFFICIENT ASSETS AVAILABLE

TO PAY PENSION BENEFITS AS THEY COME DUE. WHEN DEEMED

APPROPRIATE, WE MAY INVEST A PORTION OF THE FUNDS IN FUTURES

CONTRACTS FOR THE PURPOSE OF ACTING AS A TEMPORARY SUBSTITUTE

FOR AN INVESTMENT IN A PARTICULAR EQUITY SECURITY. THE FUND DOES

NOT ENGAGE IN SPECULATIVE FUTURES TRANSACTIONS. THE ALLOCATION

TO EACH ASSET CLASS WILL FLUCTUATE WITH MARKET CONDITIONS, SUCH

AS VOLATILITY AND LIQUIDITY CONCERNS, AND WILL TYPICALLY BE

REBALANCED WHEN OUTSIDE THE TARGET RANGES, WHICH ARE 80% TO 90%

FOR FIXED-INCOME DEBT INSTRUMENT INVESTMENTS AND 10% TO 20% FOR

DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL EQUITY FUND INVESTMENTS. THE EXPECTED

LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN FOR THE U.S. INTEL MINIMUM PENSION PLAN

ASSETS IS 5.5%.

USING LEVEL 1 INPUTS.

CONCENTRATIONS

OF RISK

WE MANAGE A VARIETY OF RISKS, INCLUDING MARKET, CREDIT, AND

LIQUIDITY RISKS, ACROSS OUR PLAN ASSETS THROUGH OUR INVESTMENT

MANAGERS. WE DEFINE A CONCENTRATION OF RISK AS AN UNDIVERSIFIED

EXPOSURE TO ONE OF THE ABOVE-MENTIONED RISKS THAT INCREASES THE

EXPOSURE OF THE LOSS OF PLAN ASSETS UNNECESSARILY. WE MONITOR

EXPOSURE TO SUCH RISKS IN BOTH THE U.S. AND

NON-U.S.

PLANS BY MONITORING THE MAGNITUDE OF THE RISK IN EACH PLAN AND

DIVERSIFYING OUR EXPOSURE TO SUCH RISKS ACROSS A VARIETY OF

INSTRUMENTS, MARKETS, AND COUNTERPARTIES. AS OF DECEMBER 25,

2010, WE DID NOT HAVE CONCENTRATIONS OF RISK IN ANY SINGLE

ENTITY, MANAGER, COUNTERPARTY, SECTOR, INDUSTRY, OR COUNTRY.

EMPLOYEE EQUITY INCENTIVE PLANS

OUR EQUITY INCENTIVE PLANS ARE BROAD-BASED, LONG-TERM PROGRAMS

INTENDED TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN TALENTED EMPLOYEES AND ALIGN

STOCKHOLDER AND EMPLOYEE INTERESTS.

IN MAY 2009, STOCKHOLDERS APPROVED AN EXTENSION OF THE 2006

EQUITY INCENTIVE PLAN (THE 2006 PLAN). STOCKHOLDERS APPROVED 134

MILLION ADDITIONAL SHARES FOR ISSUANCE, INCREASING THE TOTAL

SHARES OF COMMON STOCK AVAILABLE FOR ISSUANCE AS EQUITY AWARDS

TO EMPLOYEES AND NON-EMPLOYEE DIRECTORS TO 428 MILLION SHARES.

THE APPROVAL ALSO EXTENDED THE EXPIRATION DATE OF THE 2006 PLAN

TO JUNE 2012. THE MAXIMUM NUMBER OF SHARES TO BE AWARDED AS

NON-VESTED SHARES (RESTRICTED STOCK) OR NON-VESTED SHARE UNITS

(RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS) INCREASED TO 253 MILLION SHARES. AS OF

DECEMBER 25, 2010, 190 MILLION SHARES REMAINED AVAILABLE FOR

FUTURE GRANT UNDER THE 2006 PLAN. WE MAY ASSUME THE EQUITY

INCENTIVE PLANS AND THE OUTSTANDING EQUITY AWARDS OF CERTAIN

ACQUIRED COMPANIES. ONCE THEY ARE ASSUMED, WE DO NOT GRANT

ADDITIONAL SHARES UNDER THOSE PLANS.

ALSO IN MAY 2009, STOCKHOLDERS APPROVED AN EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTION

EXCHANGE PROGRAM (OPTION EXCHANGE) TO GIVE EMPLOYEES (NOT LISTED

OFFICERS) THE OPPORTUNITY TO EXCHANGE ELIGIBLE STOCK OPTIONS FOR

A LESSER NUMBER OF NEW STOCK OPTIONS THAT HAVE APPROXIMATELY THE

SAME FAIR VALUE AS THE OPTIONS SURRENDERED, AS OF THE DATE OF

THE EXCHANGE. THE OPTION EXCHANGE COMMENCED ON SEPTEMBER 28,

2009 AND EXPIRED ON OCTOBER 30, 2009. ELIGIBLE OPTIONS INCLUDED

STOCK OPTIONS GRANTED UNDER ANY INTEL STOCK OPTION OR EQUITY

INCENTIVE PLAN BETWEEN OCTOBER 1, 2000 AND SEPTEMBER 28, 2008

THAT HAD AN EXERCISE PRICE ABOVE $20.83, WHICH WAS THE 52-WEEK

CLOSING-PRICE HIGH AS OF OCTOBER 30, 2009. A TOTAL OF 217

MILLION ELIGIBLE STOCK OPTIONS WERE TENDERED AND CANCELLED IN

EXCHANGE FOR 83 MILLION NEW STOCK OPTIONS GRANTED. THE NEW STOCK

OPTIONS HAVE AN EXERCISE PRICE OF $19.04, WHICH IS EQUAL TO THE

MARKET PRICE OF INTEL COMMON STOCK (DEFINED AS THE AVERAGE OF

THE HIGH AND LOW TRADING PRICES) ON OCTOBER 30, 2009. THE NEW

STOCK OPTIONS WERE ISSUED UNDER THE 2006 PLAN AND ARE SUBJECT TO

ITS TERMS AND CONDITIONS. THE NEW STOCK OPTIONS VEST IN EQUAL

ANNUAL INCREMENTS OVER A FOUR-YEAR PERIOD FROM THE DATE OF GRANT

AND WILL EXPIRE SEVEN YEARS FROM THE GRANT DATE. USING THE

BLACK-SCHOLES OPTION PRICING MODEL, WE DETERMINED THAT THE FAIR

VALUE OF THE SURRENDERED STOCK OPTIONS ON A

GRANT-BY-GRANT

BASIS WAS APPROXIMATELY EQUAL, AS OF THE DATE OF THE EXCHANGE,

TO THE FAIR VALUE OF THE ELIGIBLE STOCK OPTIONS EXCHANGED,

RESULTING IN INSIGNIFICANT INCREMENTAL SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION.

IN 2009, WE BEGAN ISSUING RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS WITH BOTH A

MARKET CONDITION AND A SERVICE CONDITION (MARKET-BASED

RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS), REFERRED TO IN OUR 2010 PROXY STATEMENT

AS OUTPERFORMANCE STOCK UNITS, TO A SMALL GROUP OF SENIOR

OFFICERS AND NON-EMPLOYEE DIRECTORS. THE NUMBER OF SHARES OF

INTEL COMMON STOCK TO BE RECEIVED AT VESTING WILL RANGE FROM 33%

TO 200% OF THE TARGET AMOUNT, BASED ON TOTAL STOCKHOLDER RETURN

(TSR) ON INTEL COMMON STOCK MEASURED AGAINST THE BENCHMARK TSR

OF A PEER GROUP OVER A THREE-YEAR PERIOD. TSR IS A MEASURE OF

STOCK PRICE APPRECIATION PLUS ANY DIVIDENDS PAID IN THIS

PERFORMANCE PERIOD. AS OF DECEMBER 25, 2010, THERE WERE 3

MILLION MARKET-BASED RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS OUTSTANDING. THESE

MARKET-BASED RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS ACCRUE DIVIDEND EQUIVALENTS

AND VEST THREE YEARS AND ONE MONTH FROM THE GRANT DATE.

IN CONNECTION WITH OUR 2009 ACQUISITION OF WIND RIVER SYSTEMS,

WE ASSUMED THE COMPANYS EQUITY INCENTIVE PLANS AND ISSUED

REPLACEMENT AWARDS IN 2009. THE STOCK OPTIONS AND RESTRICTED

STOCK UNITS ISSUED GENERALLY RETAIN THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF

THE RESPECTIVE PLANS UNDER WHICH THEY WERE ORIGINALLY GRANTED.

WE WILL NOT GRANT ADDITIONAL SHARES UNDER THESE PLANS.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

EQUITY AWARDS GRANTED TO EMPLOYEES IN 2010 UNDER OUR EQUITY

INCENTIVE PLANS GENERALLY VEST OVER 4 YEARS FROM THE DATE OF

GRANT, AND OPTIONS EXPIRE 7 YEARS FROM THE DATE OF GRANT, WITH

THE EXCEPTION OF MARKET-BASED RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS AND

REPLACEMENT AWARDS RELATED TO ACQUISITIONS. EQUITY AWARDS

GRANTED TO KEY OFFICERS, SENIOR-LEVEL EMPLOYEES, AND KEY

EMPLOYEES IN 2010 MAY HAVE DELAYED VESTING BEGINNING 3 TO 5

YEARS FROM THE DATE OF GRANT, AND THESE OPTIONS EXPIRE 7 TO 10

YEARS FROM THE DATE OF GRANT.

THE 2006 STOCK PURCHASE PLAN ALLOWS ELIGIBLE EMPLOYEES TO

PURCHASE SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK AT 85% OF THE VALUE OF OUR

COMMON STOCK ON SPECIFIC DATES. UNDER THE 2006 STOCK PURCHASE

PLAN, WE MADE 240 MILLION SHARES OF COMMON STOCK AVAILABLE FOR

ISSUANCE THROUGH AUGUST 2011. AS OF DECEMBER 25, 2010, 140

MILLION SHARES WERE AVAILABLE FOR ISSUANCE UNDER THE 2006 STOCK

PURCHASE PLAN.

SHARE-BASED

COMPENSATION

SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION RECOGNIZED IN 2010 WAS $917 MILLION

($889 MILLION IN 2009 AND $851 MILLION IN 2008).

ON A QUARTERLY BASIS, WE ASSESS CHANGES TO OUR ESTIMATE OF

EXPECTED EQUITY AWARD FORFEITURES BASED ON OUR REVIEW OF RECENT

FORFEITURE ACTIVITY AND EXPECTED FUTURE EMPLOYEE TURNOVER. WE

RECOGNIZE THE EFFECT OF ADJUSTMENTS MADE TO THE FORFEITURE

RATES, IF ANY, FOR ALL EXPENSE AMORTIZATION AFTER JANUARY 1,

2006 IN THE PERIOD THAT WE CHANGE THE FORFEITURE ESTIMATE. THE

EFFECT OF FORFEITURE ADJUSTMENTS IN 2008, 2009, AND 2010 WAS NOT

SIGNIFICANT.

THE TOTAL SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION COST CAPITALIZED AS PART OF

INVENTORY AS OF DECEMBER 25, 2010 WAS $48 MILLION ($33 MILLION

AS OF DECEMBER 26, 2009 AND $46 MILLION AS OF DECEMBER 27,

2008). DURING 2010, THE TAX BENEFIT THAT WE REALIZED FOR THE TAX

DEDUCTION FROM SHARE-BASED AWARDS TOTALED $266 MILLION ($119

MILLION IN 2009 AND $147 MILLION IN 2008).

WE ESTIMATE THE FAIR VALUE OF RESTRICTED STOCK UNIT AWARDS WITH

TIME-BASED VESTING USING THE VALUE OF OUR COMMON STOCK ON THE

DATE OF GRANT, REDUCED BY THE PRESENT VALUE OF DIVIDENDS

EXPECTED TO BE PAID ON OUR COMMON STOCK PRIOR TO VESTING. WE

ESTIMATE THE FAIR VALUE OF MARKET-BASED RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS

USING A MONTE CARLO SIMULATION MODEL ON THE DATE OF GRANT. WE

BASED THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE ESTIMATED VALUES OF RESTRICTED STOCK

UNIT GRANTS, AS WELL AS THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE ASSUMPTIONS THAT WE

COMMON STOCK REPURCHASES

COMMON

STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM

AS OF DECEMBER 25, 2010, WE HAD AN ONGOING AUTHORIZATION,

AMENDED IN NOVEMBER 2005, FROM OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS TO

REPURCHASE UP TO $25 BILLION IN SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK IN

OPEN MARKET OR NEGOTIATED TRANSACTIONS, AND $4.2 BILLION

REMAINED AVAILABLE FOR REPURCHASE UNDER THE EXISTING REPURCHASE

AUTHORIZATION LIMIT. IN JANUARY 2011, OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS

INCREASED THE REPURCHASE AUTHORIZATION LIMIT BY $10 BILLION.

DURING 2010, WE REPURCHASED 70.3 MILLION SHARES OF COMMON STOCK

AT A COST OF $1.5 BILLION. DURING 2009, WE UTILIZED THE MAJORITY

OF THE PROCEEDS FROM THE ISSUANCE OF THE 2009 DEBENTURES TO

REPURCHASE 88.2 MILLION SHARES OF COMMON STOCK AT A COST OF $1.7

BILLION (FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ON THE ISSUANCE OF THE 2009

DEBENTURES, SEE NOTE 21: BORROWINGS). WE REPURCHASED

324 MILLION SHARES AT A COST OF $7.1 BILLION DURING 2008. WE

HAVE REPURCHASED 3.4 BILLION SHARES AT A COST OF $70 BILLION

SINCE THE PROGRAM BEGAN IN 1990. OUR REPURCHASES IN 2010 AND

2009 AND A PORTION OF OUR PURCHASES IN 2008 WERE EXECUTED IN

PRIVATELY NEGOTIATED TRANSACTIONS.

RESTRICTED

STOCK UNIT WITHHOLDINGS

WE ISSUE RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS AS PART OF OUR EQUITY INCENTIVE

PLANS. FOR THE MAJORITY OF RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS GRANTED, THE

NUMBER OF SHARES ISSUED ON THE DATE THE RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS

VEST IS NET OF THE MINIMUM STATUTORY WITHHOLDING REQUIREMENTS

THAT WE PAY IN CASH TO THE APPROPRIATE TAXING AUTHORITIES ON

BEHALF OF OUR EMPLOYEES. DURING 2010, WE WITHHELD 10.1 MILLION

SHARES (5.8 MILLION SHARES DURING 2009 AND 3.5 MILLION SHARES

DURING 2008) TO SATISFY $236 MILLION ($92 MILLION DURING 2009

AND $78 MILLION DURING 2008) OF EMPLOYEES TAX OBLIGATIONS.

ALTHOUGH SHARES WITHHELD ARE NOT ISSUED, THEY ARE TREATED AS

COMMON STOCK REPURCHASES IN OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS, AS THEY REDUCE THE NUMBER OF SHARES THAT WOULD HAVE

BEEN ISSUED UPON VESTING.

DILUTED EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE USING NET INCOME AVAILABLE TO

COMMON STOCKHOLDERS AND THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE NUMBER OF COMMON

SHARES OUTSTANDING PLUS POTENTIALLY DILUTIVE COMMON SHARES

OUTSTANDING DURING THE PERIOD. NET INCOME AVAILABLE TO

PARTICIPATING SECURITIES WAS INSIGNIFICANT FOR ALL PERIODS

PRESENTED.

POTENTIALLY DILUTIVE COMMON SHARES FROM EMPLOYEE INCENTIVE PLANS

ARE DETERMINED BY APPLYING THE TREASURY STOCK METHOD TO THE

ASSUMED EXERCISE OF OUTSTANDING STOCK OPTIONS, THE ASSUMED

VESTING OF OUTSTANDING RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS, AND THE ASSUMED

ISSUANCE OF COMMON STOCK UNDER THE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN.

POTENTIALLY DILUTIVE COMMON SHARES ARE DETERMINED BY APPLYING

THE IF-CONVERTED METHOD FOR THE 2005 DEBENTURES. HOWEVER, AS OUR

2009 DEBENTURES REQUIRE SETTLEMENT OF THE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF

THE DEBT IN CASH UPON CONVERSION, WITH THE CONVERSION PREMIUM

PAID IN CASH OR STOCK AT OUR OPTION, POTENTIALLY DILUTIVE COMMON

SHARES ARE DETERMINED BY APPLYING THE TREASURY STOCK METHOD. FOR

FURTHER DISCUSSION ON THE SPECIFIC CONVERSION FEATURES OF OUR

2005 AND 2009 DEBENTURES, SEE NOTE 21: BORROWINGS.

FOR 2010, WE EXCLUDED 161 MILLION OUTSTANDING WEIGHTED AVERAGE

STOCK OPTIONS (486 MILLION IN 2009 AND 484 MILLION IN 2008) FROM

THE CALCULATION OF DILUTED EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE BECAUSE THE

EXERCISE PRICES OF THESE STOCK OPTIONS WERE GREATER THAN OR

EQUAL TO THE AVERAGE MARKET VALUE OF THE COMMON SHARES. THESE

OPTIONS COULD BE INCLUDED IN THE CALCULATION IN THE FUTURE IF

THE AVERAGE MARKET VALUE OF THE COMMON SHARES INCREASES AND IS

GREATER THAN THE EXERCISE PRICE OF THE OPTIONS. WE ALSO EXCLUDED

OUR 2009 DEBENTURES FROM THE CALCULATION OF DILUTED EARNINGS PER

COMMON SHARE BECAUSE THE CONVERSION OPTION OF THE DEBENTURES WAS

ANTI-DILUTIVE. IN THE FUTURE, WE COULD HAVE POTENTIALLY DILUTIVE

SHARES IF THE AVERAGE MARKET PRICE IS ABOVE THE CONVERSION PRICE.

RELATED TO TAX POSITIONS TAKEN DURING PRIOR PERIODS. THE RESULT

OF THE SETTLEMENTS, EFFECTIVE SETTLEMENTS, AND RESULTING

REMEASUREMENTS WAS A REDUCTION OF $73 MILLION IN THE BALANCE OF

OUR GROSS UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS ($526 MILLION IN 2009, $154

MILLION IN 2008), $48 MILLION OF WHICH RESULTED IN A TAX BENEFIT

IF THE REMAINING BALANCE OF $216 MILLION OF UNRECOGNIZED TAX

BENEFITS AS OF DECEMBER 25, 2010 ($220 MILLION AS OF DECEMBER

TAX BENEFIT OF $124 MILLION AND A REDUCTION OF THE EFFECTIVE TAX

RATE ($101 MILLION AS OF DECEMBER 26, 2009).

DURING ALL YEARS PRESENTED, WE RECOGNIZED INTEREST AND PENALTIES

RELATED TO UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS WITHIN THE PROVISION FOR

TAXES ON THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME. IN 2009, WE

RECOGNIZED A NET BENEFIT OF $62 MILLION, PRIMARILY DUE TO THE

REVERSAL OF ACCRUED INTEREST AND PENALTIES RELATED TO SETTLED

AND EFFECTIVELY SETTLED MATTERS DESCRIBED ABOVE (INSIGNIFICANT

FOR 2010 AND 2008). AS OF DECEMBER 25, 2010, WE HAD $49 MILLION

BENEFITS ($55 MILLION AS OF DECEMBER 26, 2009).

ALTHOUGH THE TIMING OF THE RESOLUTION

AND/OR

CLOSURE ON AUDITS IS HIGHLY UNCERTAIN, IT IS REASONABLY POSSIBLE

THAT THE BALANCE OF GROSS UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS COULD

SIGNIFICANTLY CHANGE IN THE NEXT 12 MONTHS. HOWEVER, GIVEN THE

NUMBER OF YEARS REMAINING SUBJECT TO EXAMINATION AND THE NUMBER

OF MATTERS BEING EXAMINED, WE ARE UNABLE TO ESTIMATE THE FULL

RANGE OF POSSIBLE ADJUSTMENTS TO THE BALANCE OF GROSS

UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS.

WE FILE U.S. FEDERAL, U.S. STATE, AND

NON-U.S.

TAX

RETURNS. FOR U.S. STATE AND

NON-U.S.

TAX

RETURNS, WE ARE GENERALLY NO LONGER SUBJECT TO TAX EXAMINATIONS

FOR YEARS PRIOR TO 1996. FOR U.S. FEDERAL TAX RETURNS, WE ARE NO

LONGER SUBJECT TO TAX EXAMINATION FOR YEARS PRIOR TO 2006.

CONTINGENCIES

LEGAL

PROCEEDINGS

WE ARE CURRENTLY A PARTY TO VARIOUS LEGAL PROCEEDINGS, INCLUDING

THOSE NOTED IN THIS SECTION. WHILE MANAGEMENT PRESENTLY BELIEVES

THAT THE ULTIMATE OUTCOME OF THESE PROCEEDINGS, INDIVIDUALLY AND

IN THE AGGREGATE, WILL NOT MATERIALLY HARM THE COMPANYS

FINANCIAL POSITION, CASH FLOWS, OR OVERALL TRENDS IN RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS, LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND RELATED GOVERNMENT

INVESTIGATIONS ARE SUBJECT TO INHERENT UNCERTAINTIES, AND

UNFAVORABLE RULINGS OR OTHER EVENTS COULD OCCUR. UNFAVORABLE

RULINGS COULD INCLUDE SUBSTANTIAL MONETARY DAMAGES, AND IN

MATTERS FOR WHICH INJUNCTIVE RELIEF OR OTHER CONDUCT REMEDIES

ARE SOUGHT, AN INJUNCTION OR OTHER ORDER PROHIBITING US FROM

SELLING ONE OR MORE PRODUCTS AT ALL OR IN PARTICULAR WAYS,

PRECLUDING PARTICULAR BUSINESS PRACTICES, OR REQUIRING OTHER

REMEDIES SUCH AS COMPULSORY LICENSING OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY.

WERE UNFAVORABLE FINAL OUTCOMES TO OCCUR, THERE EXISTS THE

POSSIBILITY OF A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR BUSINESS,

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL POSITION, AND OVERALL TRENDS.

IT IS ALSO POSSIBLE THAT WE COULD CONCLUDE IT IS IN THE BEST

INTERESTS OF OUR STOCKHOLDERS, EMPLOYEES, AND CUSTOMERS TO

SETTLE ONE OR MORE SUCH MATTERS, AND ANY SUCH SETTLEMENT COULD

INCLUDE SUBSTANTIAL PAYMENTS; HOWEVER, WE HAVE NOT REACHED THIS

CONCLUSION WITH RESPECT TO ANY PARTICULAR MATTER AT THIS TIME.

EXCEPT AS MAY BE OTHERWISE INDICATED, THE OUTCOMES IN THESE

MATTERS ARE NOT REASONABLY ESTIMABLE.

A NUMBER OF PROCEEDINGS GENERALLY HAVE CHALLENGED AND CONTINUE

TO CHALLENGE CERTAIN OF OUR COMPETITIVE PRACTICES. THE

ALLEGATIONS IN THESE PROCEEDINGS VARY AND ARE DESCRIBED IN MORE

DETAIL IN THE FOLLOWING PARAGRAPHS, BUT IN GENERAL CONTEND THAT

WE IMPROPERLY CONDITION PRICE REBATES AND OTHER DISCOUNTS ON OUR

MICROPROCESSORS ON EXCLUSIVE OR NEAR-EXCLUSIVE DEALING BY SOME

OF OUR CUSTOMERS; CLAIM THAT OUR SOFTWARE COMPILER BUSINESS

UNFAIRLY PREFERS INTEL MICROPROCESSORS OVER COMPETING

MICROPROCESSORS AND THAT, THROUGH THE USE OF OUR COMPILER AND

OTHER MEANS, WE HAVE CAUSED INACCURATE AND MISLEADING BENCHMARK

RESULTS CONCERNING OUR MICROPROCESSORS TO BE DISSEMINATED;

ALLEGE THAT WE UNFAIRLY CONTROLLED THE CONTENT AND TIMING OF

RELEASE OF VARIOUS STANDARD COMPUTER INTERFACES DEVELOPED BY

INTEL IN COOPERATION WITH OTHER INDUSTRY PARTICIPANTS; AND

ACCUSE US OF ENGAGING IN VARIOUS ACTS OF IMPROPER COMPETITIVE

ACTIVITY IN COMPETING AGAINST WHAT IS REFERRED TO AS

GENERAL-PURPOSE GRAPHICS PROCESSING UNITS (GPUS), INCLUDING

CERTAIN LICENSING PRACTICES AND OUR ACTIONS IN CONNECTION WITH

DEVELOPING AND DISCLOSING POTENTIALLY COMPETITIVE TECHNOLOGY.

WE BELIEVE THAT WE COMPETE LAWFULLY AND THAT OUR MARKETING,

BUSINESS, INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, AND OTHER CHALLENGED PRACTICES

BENEFIT OUR CUSTOMERS AND OUR STOCKHOLDERS, AND WE WILL CONTINUE

TO CONDUCT A VIGOROUS DEFENSE IN THESE PROCEEDINGS. WHILE WE

HAVE SETTLED SOME OF THESE MATTERS, THE DISTRACTIONS CAUSED BY

CHALLENGES TO THESE PRACTICES FROM THE REMAINING MATTERS ARE

UNDESIRABLE, AND THE LEGAL AND OTHER COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH

DEFENDING AND RESOLVING OUR POSITION HAVE BEEN AND CONTINUE TO

BE SIGNIFICANT. WE ASSUME THAT THESE CHALLENGES COULD CONTINUE

FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS AND MAY REQUIRE THE INVESTMENT OF

SUBSTANTIAL ADDITIONAL MANAGEMENT TIME AND SUBSTANTIAL FINANCIAL

RESOURCES TO EXPLAIN AND DEFEND OUR POSITION.

GOVERNMENT

COMPETITION MATTERS AND RELATED CONSUMER CLASS ACTIONS

IN 2001, THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION (EC) COMMENCED AN INVESTIGATION

REGARDING CLAIMS BY ADVANCED MICRO DEVICES, INC. (AMD) THAT WE

USED UNFAIR BUSINESS PRACTICES TO PERSUADE CLIENTS TO BUY OUR

MICROPROCESSORS. SINCE THAT TIME, WE HAVE RECEIVED NUMEROUS

REQUESTS FOR INFORMATION AND DOCUMENTS FROM THE EC, AND WE HAVE

RESPONDED TO EACH OF THOSE REQUESTS. THE EC ISSUED A STATEMENT

OF OBJECTIONS IN JULY 2007 AND HELD A HEARING ON THAT STATEMENT

IN MARCH 2008. THE EC ISSUED A SUPPLEMENTAL STATEMENT OF

OBJECTIONS IN JULY 2008.

IN MAY 2009, THE EC ISSUED A DECISION FINDING THAT WE HAD

VIOLATED ARTICLE 82 OF THE EC TREATY AND ARTICLE 54 OF THE

EUROPEAN ECONOMIC AREA AGREEMENT. IN GENERAL, THE EC FOUND THAT

WE VIOLATED ARTICLE 82 (LATER RENUMBERED AS ARTICLE 102 BY A NEW

TREATY) BY OFFERING ALLEGED CONDITIONAL REBATES AND

PAYMENTS THAT REQUIRED OUR CUSTOMERS TO PURCHASE ALL OR

MOST OF THEIR X86 MICROPROCESSORS FROM US. THE EC ALSO FOUND

THAT WE VIOLATED ARTICLE 82 BY MAKING ALLEGED PAYMENTS TO

PREVENT SALES OF SPECIFIC RIVAL PRODUCTS. THE EC IMPOSED A

FINE IN THE AMOUNT OF 1.06 BILLION ($1.447 BILLION AS OF

MAY 2009), WHICH WE SUBSEQUENTLY PAID DURING THE THIRD QUARTER

OF 2009, AND ALSO ORDERED US TO IMMEDIATELY BRING TO AN

END THE INFRINGEMENT REFERRED TO IN THE EC DECISION. IN

THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2009, WE RECORDED THE RELATED CHARGE

WITHIN MARKETING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE ON THE CONSOLIDATED

STATEMENTS OF INCOME. WE STRONGLY DISAGREE WITH THE ECS

DECISION, AND WE APPEALED THE DECISION TO THE COURT OF FIRST

INSTANCE (WHICH HAS BEEN RENAMED THE GENERAL COURT) IN JULY

2009. THE EC FILED AN ANSWER TO OUR REPLY BRIEF IN NOVEMBER

2010. THE COURTS DECISION, AFTER ADDITIONAL BRIEFING AND

ORAL ARGUMENT, IS EXPECTED IN 2012.

THE EC DECISION EXCEEDS 500 PAGES AND DOES NOT CONTAIN SPECIFIC

DIRECTION ON WHETHER OR HOW WE SHOULD MODIFY OUR BUSINESS

PRACTICES. INSTEAD, THE DECISION STATES THAT WE SHOULD

CEASE AND DESIST FROM FURTHER CONDUCT THAT, IN THE

ECS OPINION, WOULD VIOLATE APPLICABLE LAW. WE HAVE TAKEN

STEPS, WHICH ARE SUBJECT TO THE ECS ONGOING REVIEW, TO

COMPLY WITH THAT DECISION PENDING APPEAL. WE OPENED DISCUSSIONS

WITH THE EC TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE DECISION AND TO EXPLAIN

CHANGES TO OUR BUSINESS PRACTICES. BASED ON OUR CURRENT

UNDERSTANDING AND EXPECTATIONS, WE DO NOT BELIEVE THAT ANY SUCH

CHANGES WILL BE MATERIAL TO OUR FINANCIAL POSITION, RESULTS, OR

CASH FLOWS.

IN JUNE 2005, WE RECEIVED AN INQUIRY FROM THE KOREA FAIR TRADE

COMMISSION (KFTC) REQUESTING DOCUMENTS FROM OUR KOREAN

SUBSIDIARY RELATED TO MARKETING AND REBATE PROGRAMS THAT WE

ENTERED INTO WITH KOREAN PC MANUFACTURERS. IN FEBRUARY 2006, THE

KFTC INITIATED AN INSPECTION OF DOCUMENTS AT OUR OFFICES IN

KOREA. IN SEPTEMBER 2007, THE KFTC SERVED ON US AN EXAMINATION

REPORT ALLEGING THAT SALES TO TWO CUSTOMERS DURING PARTS OF

20022005 VIOLATED KOREAS MONOPOLY REGULATION AND

FAIR TRADE ACT. IN DECEMBER 2007, WE SUBMITTED OUR WRITTEN

RESPONSE TO THE KFTC. IN FEBRUARY 2008, THE KFTCS EXAMINER

SUBMITTED A WRITTEN REPLY TO OUR RESPONSE. IN MARCH 2008, WE

SUBMITTED A FURTHER RESPONSE. IN APRIL 2008, WE PARTICIPATED IN

A PRE-HEARING CONFERENCE BEFORE THE KFTC, AND WE PARTICIPATED IN

FORMAL HEARINGS IN MAY AND JUNE 2008. IN JUNE 2008, THE KFTC

ANNOUNCED ITS INTENT TO FINE US APPROXIMATELY $25 MILLION FOR

PROVIDING DISCOUNTS TO SAMSUNG ELECTRONICS CO., LTD. AND TRIGEM

COMPUTER INC. IN NOVEMBER 2008, THE KFTC ISSUED A FINAL WRITTEN

DECISION CONCLUDING THAT OUR DISCOUNTS HAD VIOLATED KOREAN

ANTITRUST LAW AND IMPOSING A FINE ON US OF APPROXIMATELY $20

MILLION, WHICH WE PAID IN JANUARY 2009. IN DECEMBER 2008, WE

APPEALED THIS DECISION BY FILING A LAWSUIT IN THE SEOUL HIGH

COURT SEEKING TO OVERTURN THE KFTCS DECISION. WE EXPECT A

DECISION FROM THE COURT IN 2011.

IN NOVEMBER 2009, THE STATE OF NEW YORK FILED A LAWSUIT AGAINST

US IN THE U.S. DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE. THE

LAWSUIT ALLEGES THAT WE VIOLATED FEDERAL ANTITRUST LAWS; THE NEW

YORK DONNELLY ACT, WHICH PROHIBITS CONTRACTS OR AGREEMENTS TO

MONOPOLIZE; AND THE NEW YORK EXECUTIVE LAW, WHICH PROSCRIBES

UNDERLYING VIOLATIONS OF FEDERAL AND STATE ANTITRUST LAWS. THE

LAWSUIT ALLEGES THAT WE ENGAGED IN A SYSTEMATIC WORLDWIDE

CAMPAIGN OF ILLEGAL, EXCLUSIONARY CONDUCT TO MAINTAIN MONOPOLY

POWER AND PRICES IN THE MARKET FOR X86 MICROPROCESSORS THROUGH

THE USE OF VARIOUS ALLEGED ACTIONS, INCLUDING EXCLUSIVE OR

NEAR-EXCLUSIVE AGREEMENTS FROM LARGE COMPUTER MAKERS IN EXCHANGE

FOR LOYALTY PAYMENTS AND BRIBES, AND

OTHER ALLEGED THREATS AND RETALIATION. THE PLAINTIFF CLAIMS THAT

OUR ALLEGED ACTIONS HARMED CONSUMERS, COMPETITION, AND

INNOVATION. THE LAWSUIT SEEKS A DECLARATION THAT OUR ALLEGED

ACTIONS HAVE VIOLATED THE FEDERAL AND NEW YORK ANTITRUST LAWS

AND THE NEW YORK EXECUTIVE LAW; AN INJUNCTION TO PREVENT FURTHER

ALLEGED UNLAWFUL ACTS; UNSPECIFIED DAMAGES IN AN AMOUNT TO BE

PROVEN AT TRIAL, TREBLED AS PROVIDED FOR BY LAW, RESTITUTION,

AND DISGORGEMENT; $1 MILLION FOR EACH VIOLATION OF THE DONNELLY

ACT PROVEN BY THE PLAINTIFF, AND ATTORNEYS FEES AND COSTS.

IN JANUARY 2010, WE FILED OUR ANSWER.

IN DECEMBER 2010, THE N.Y. ATTORNEY GENERALS STAFF

REQUESTED THE COURTS PERMISSION TO AMEND ITS COMPLAINT TO

EXPAND THE SCOPE OF PARTIES COVERED BY ITS DONNELLY ACT AND

EXECUTIVE LAW CLAIMS. INTEL FILED AN OPPOSITION TO THE MOTION,

AND A HEARING IS SCHEDULED FOR MAY 2011. WE DISAGREE WITH THE

PLAINTIFFS ALLEGATIONS AND CLAIMS IN BOTH THE ORIGINAL

COMPLAINT AND THE PROPOSED AMENDED COMPLAINT, AND INTEND TO

CONDUCT A VIGOROUS DEFENSE OF THE LAWSUIT. THE COURT HAS SET A

TRIAL TO BEGIN ON THIS MATTER IN FEBRUARY 2012.

IN JUNE 2008, THE U.S. FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION (FTC) ANNOUNCED

A FORMAL INVESTIGATION INTO OUR SALES PRACTICES. IN DECEMBER

2009, THREE FTC COMMISSIONERS VOTED TO ISSUE AN ADMINISTRATIVE

COMPLAINT ALLEGING THAT WE HAD VIOLATED SECTION 5 OF THE FTC ACT

BY ENGAGING IN UNFAIR METHODS OF COMPETITION AND UNFAIR ACTS OR

PRACTICES IN MARKETS FOR CPUS AND GPUS. IN NOVEMBER 2010, THE

FTC PUBLICLY ANNOUNCED THE FINAL APPROVAL TO A SETTLEMENT

BETWEEN INTEL AND THE FTC THAT FULLY RESOLVES THE FTCS

2009 LAWSUIT AGAINST INTEL. AMONG OTHER PROVISIONS, THE

AGREEMENT INCLUDES: A STATEMENT THAT THE AGREEMENT DOES NOT

CONSTITUTE AN ADMISSION THAT INTEL HAS VIOLATED THE LAW OR THAT

THE FACTS ALLEGED IN THE COMPLAINT ARE TRUE; PROVISIONS WITH

RESPECT TO THE TREATMENT AND EXTENSION OF CERTAIN INTELLECTUAL

PROPERTY AGREEMENTS BETWEEN INTEL AND AMD, INTEL AND NVIDIA

CORPORATION, AND INTEL AND VIA TECHNOLOGIES, INC.; PROVISIONS

WITH RESPECT TO INTELS SALES, MARKETING, PRICING, AND

PROMOTIONAL ACTIVITIES FOR CERTAIN INTEL MICROPROCESSORS AND

CHIPSETS; PROVISIONS CONCERNING ENGINEERING AND DESIGN CHANGES

TO CERTAIN INTEL PRODUCTS; PROVISIONS CONCERNING INTELS

ACTIONS WITH RESPECT TO PRODUCT ROADMAPS; DISCLOSURE AND OTHER

TERMS WITH RESPECT TO INTELS COMPILERS AND RELATED

PRODUCTS; AND PROVISIONS RELATED TO COMPLIANCE WITH THE

AGREEMENT. INTEL CONTINUES TO DISAGREE WITH THE FTCS

ALLEGATIONS THAT INTEL HAS VIOLATED ANY LAW. NEVERTHELESS, INTEL

BELIEVES THAT THE SETTLEMENT IS APPROPRIATE AND IN THE BEST

INTERESTS OF ITS STOCKHOLDERS, EMPLOYEES, AND CUSTOMERS. BASED

ON OUR CURRENT UNDERSTANDING AND EXPECTATIONS, WE DO NOT BELIEVE

THAT ANY CHANGES IN OUR BUSINESS PRACTICES TO COMPLY WITH THE

AGREEMENT WILL BE MATERIAL TO OUR FINANCIAL POSITION, RESULTS,

OR CASH FLOWS.

AT LEAST 82 SEPARATE CLASS ACTIONS HAVE BEEN FILED IN THE U.S.

DISTRICT COURTS FOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA,

SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA, DISTRICT OF IDAHO, DISTRICT OF

NEBRASKA, DISTRICT OF NEW MEXICO, DISTRICT OF MAINE, AND

DISTRICT OF DELAWARE, AS WELL AS IN VARIOUS CALIFORNIA, KANSAS,

AND TENNESSEE STATE COURTS. THESE ACTIONS GENERALLY REPEAT THE

ALLEGATIONS MADE IN A NOW-SETTLED LAWSUIT FILED AGAINST INTEL BY

AMD IN JUNE 2005 IN THE U.S. DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF

DELAWARE (AMD LITIGATION). LIKE THE AMD LAWSUIT, THESE

CLASS-ACTION

SUITS ALLEGE THAT INTEL ENGAGED IN VARIOUS ACTIONS IN VIOLATION

OF THE SHERMAN ACT AND OTHER LAWS BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS,

PROVIDING DISCOUNTS AND REBATES TO OUR MANUFACTURER AND

DISTRIBUTOR CUSTOMERS CONDITIONED ON EXCLUSIVE OR NEAR EXCLUSIVE

DEALINGS THAT ALLEGEDLY UNFAIRLY INTERFERED WITH AMDS

ABILITY TO SELL ITS MICROPROCESSORS, INTERFERING WITH CERTAIN

AMD PRODUCT LAUNCHES, AND INTERFERING WITH AMDS

PARTICIPATION IN CERTAIN INDUSTRY STANDARDS-SETTING GROUPS. THE

CLASS ACTIONS ALLEGE VARIOUS CONSUMER INJURIES, INCLUDING THAT

CONSUMERS IN VARIOUS STATES HAVE BEEN INJURED BY PAYING HIGHER

PRICES FOR COMPUTERS CONTAINING OUR MICROPROCESSORS. ALL OF THE

FEDERAL CLASS ACTIONS AND THE KANSAS AND TENNESSEE STATE COURT

CLASS ACTIONS HAVE BEEN CONSOLIDATED BY THE MULTIDISTRICT

LITIGATION PANEL TO THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE, AND THE COURT HAS

APPOINTED A SPECIAL MASTER TO ADDRESS ISSUES IN THE LITIGATION

AS ASSIGNED BY THE COURT. IN JANUARY 2010, THE PLAINTIFFS IN THE

DELAWARE ACTION FILED A MOTION FOR SANCTIONS FOR OUR FAILURE TO

PRESERVE EVIDENCE. THIS MOTION LARGELY COPIES A MOTION

PREVIOUSLY FILED BY AMD IN THE AMD LITIGATION, WHICH HAS

SETTLED. THE PLAINTIFFS IN THE COORDINATED ACTIONS ALSO MOVED

FOR CERTIFICATION OF A CLASS OF MEMBERS WHO PURCHASED CERTAIN

PERSONAL COMPUTERS CONTAINING PRODUCTS SOLD BY INTEL. IN JULY

2010, THE SPECIAL MASTER ISSUED A REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION

(CLASS REPORT) DENYING THE MOTION TO CERTIFY A CLASS. THE

PLAINTIFFS FILED OBJECTIONS TO THE SPECIAL MASTERS CLASS

REPORT, AND A HEARING ON THESE OBJECTIONS IS SCHEDULED FOR MARCH

2011. ALL CALIFORNIA CLASS ACTIONS HAVE BEEN CONSOLIDATED TO THE

SUPERIOR COURT OF CALIFORNIA IN SANTA CLARA COUNTY. THE

PLAINTIFFS IN THE CALIFORNIA ACTIONS HAVE MOVED FOR CLASS

CERTIFICATION, WHICH WE ARE IN THE PROCESS OF OPPOSING. AT OUR

REQUEST, THE COURT IN THE CALIFORNIA ACTIONS HAS AGREED TO DELAY

RULING ON THIS MOTION UNTIL AFTER THE DELAWARE DISTRICT COURT

RULES ON THE SIMILAR MOTION IN THE COORDINATED ACTIONS. WE

DISPUTE THE

CLASS-ACTION

CLAIMS AND INTEND TO DEFEND THE LAWSUITS VIGOROUSLY.

ANTITRUST

DERIVATIVE LITIGATION AND RELATED MATTERS

IN FEBRUARY 2008, MARTIN SMILOW FILED A PUTATIVE STOCKHOLDER

DERIVATIVE ACTION IN THE U.S. DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF

DELAWARE AGAINST MEMBERS OF OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS. THE

COMPLAINT ALLEGED GENERALLY THAT THE BOARD ALLOWED THE COMPANY

TO VIOLATE ANTITRUST AND OTHER LAWS, AS ALLEGED IN THE AMD

LITIGATION, AND THAT THOSE ALLEGED BOARD-SANCTIONED ACTIVITIES

HARMED THE COMPANY. THE COMPLAINT REPEATED MANY OF THE

ALLEGATIONS MADE IN THE AMD LITIGATION AND REFERENCED VARIOUS

INVESTIGATIONS BY THE EC, KFTC, AND OTHERS. IN FEBRUARY 2008,

EVAN TOBIAS FILED A PUTATIVE STOCKHOLDER DERIVATIVE SUIT IN THE

SAME COURT AGAINST THE BOARD CONTAINING MANY OF THE SAME

ALLEGATIONS AS THE SMILOW SUIT. IN JULY 2008, THE DISTRICT COURT

ORDERED SMILOW AND TOBIAS TO FILE A SINGLE, CONSOLIDATED

COMPLAINT. AN AMENDED CONSOLIDATED COMPLAINT WAS FILED IN AUGUST

2008. IN JUNE 2009, THE COURT GRANTED THE DEFENDANTS

MOTION TO DISMISS THE PLAINTIFFS CONSOLIDATED COMPLAINT

WITH PREJUDICE. IN JULY 2009, SMILOW AND THE ROSENFELD FAMILY

FOUNDATION MADE A DEMAND TO INSPECT CERTAIN OF OUR BOOKS AND

RECORDS PURSUANT TO SECTION 220 OF THE DELAWARE GENERAL

CORPORATION LAW, AND IN NOVEMBER 2009, SMILOW AND THE ROSENFELD

FAMILY FOUNDATION FILED AN ACTION IN DELAWARE CHANCERY COURT TO

ENFORCE THAT DEMAND.

IN JUNE 2008, CHRISTINE DEL GAIZO FILED A PUTATIVE STOCKHOLDER

DERIVATIVE SUIT IN THE SANTA CLARA COUNTY SUPERIOR COURT AGAINST

THE BOARD, A FORMER DIRECTOR OF THE BOARD, AND SIX OF OUR

OF THE COURT.

IN NOVEMBER 2009, CHARLES GILMAN FILED A PUTATIVE STOCKHOLDER

DERIVATIVE SUIT IN THE U.S. DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF

DELAWARE AGAINST CERTAIN INTEL BOARD MEMBERS AS WELL AS THREE

FORMER BOARD MEMBERS. IN DECEMBER 2009, THE LOUISIANA MUNICIPAL

POLICE EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT SYSTEM (LMPERS) FILED A PUTATIVE

STOCKHOLDER DERIVATIVE SUIT IN THE SAME COURT AGAINST THE SAME

DEFENDANTS. IN JANUARY 2010, THE DISTRICT COURT ORDERED GILMAN

IN MAY 2010, WE ENTERED INTO A STIPULATION OF SETTLEMENT TO

RESOLVE ALL OF THE FOREGOING STOCKHOLDER DERIVATIVE LITIGATION

THE SETTLEMENT WAS APPROVED BY THE DELAWARE DISTRICT COURT IN

JULY 2010. PURSUANT TO THE DELAWARE DISTRICT COURTS

INTEL

CORPORATION V. NVIDIA CORPORATION

IN FEBRUARY 2009, INTEL FILED A DECLARATORY JUDGMENT LAWSUIT

AGAINST NVIDIA IN THE DELAWARE COURT OF CHANCERY CONCERNING A

CHIPSET PATENT LICENSE AGREEMENT SIGNED BY INTEL AND NVIDIA IN

2004. THE LAWSUIT SOUGHT A DECLARATORY JUDGMENT THAT CHIPSETS

FOR INTEL MICROPROCESSORS WITH INTEGRATED MEMORY CONTROLLERS ARE

NOT LICENSED PRODUCTS UNDER THE CHIPSET AGREEMENT. NVIDIA DENIED

INTELS CLAIMS AND IN MARCH 2009 FILED COUNTERCLAIMS

AGAINST INTEL SEEKING A DECLARATION THAT NVIDIA IS LICENSED,

ALLEGING THAT INTEL BREACHED THE CHIPSET AGREEMENT BY MAKING

FALSE AND MISLEADING STATEMENTS ABOUT NVIDIAS RIGHTS, AND

ALLEGING THAT INTEL BREACHED THE IMPLIED COVENANT OF GOOD FAITH

AND FAIR DEALING BY TAKING ACTIONS TO DEPRIVE AND HINDER

NVIDIAS SALES OF CHIPSETS. NVIDIA SOUGHT SUBSTANTIAL

MONETARY DAMAGES AND AN ORDER TERMINATING INTELS RIGHTS

UNDER A SEPARATE PATENT CROSS-LICENSE AGREEMENT SIGNED BY INTEL

AND NVIDIA IN 2004. IN JANUARY 2011, WE ENTERED INTO AN

AGREEMENT WITH NVIDIA TO CROSS-LICENSE CERTAIN PATENTS AND

SETTLE THE EXISTING LITIGATION BETWEEN THE COMPANIES. UNDER THE

AGREEMENT, WE RECEIVED A LICENSE TO ALL OF NVIDIAS PATENTS

WITH A CAPTURE PERIOD THAT RUNS THROUGH MARCH 2017. IN EXCHANGE,

WE AGREED TO MAKE PAYMENTS TOTALING $1.5 BILLION TO NVIDIA OVER

SIX YEARS ($300 MILLION ANNUALLY FROM 2011 THROUGH 2013, AND

$200 MILLION ANNUALLY FROM 2014 THROUGH 2016), WHICH WILL BE

RECOGNIZED AS A LIABILITY TOTALING APPROXIMATELY $1.4 BILLION,

ON A DISCOUNTED BASIS. IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2010, WE

RECOGNIZED AN EXPENSE OF $100 MILLION WITHIN MARKETING, GENERAL

AND ADMINISTRATIVE ON THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME. THE

REMAINING AMOUNT, APPROXIMATELY $1.3 BILLION, WILL BE RECOGNIZED

AS AN INTANGIBLE ASSET IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2011 AND WILL BE

AMORTIZED INTO COST OF SALES OVER FUTURE PERIODS. ADDITIONALLY,

WE GRANTED NVIDIA A LICENSE TO INTELS PATENTS SUBJECT TO

CERTAIN EXCLUSIONS, INCLUDING X86 PRODUCTS, CERTAIN CHIPSETS,

AND CERTAIN FLASH MEMORY TECHNOLOGY PRODUCTS.

LEHMAN

MATTER

IN NOVEMBER 2009, REPRESENTATIVES OF LEHMAN BROTHERS HOLDINGS

INC. (LEHMAN) ADVISED US INFORMALLY THAT THE LEHMAN BANKRUPTCY

ESTATE WAS CONSIDERING A CLAIM AGAINST US ARISING FROM A 2008

CONTRACT BETWEEN INTEL AND LEHMAN BROTHERS OTC DERIVATIVES INC.

(LEHMAN OTC). UNDER THE TERMS OF THE 2008 CONTRACT, INTEL

PREPAID $1.0 BILLION TO LEHMAN OTC, IN EXCHANGE FOR WHICH LEHMAN

OTC WAS REQUIRED TO PURCHASE AND DELIVER TO INTEL THE NUMBER OF

SHARES OF INTEL COMMON STOCK THAT COULD BE PURCHASED FOR $1.0

BILLION AT THE VOLUME-WEIGHTED AVERAGE PRICE FOR THE PERIOD

AUGUST 26, 2008 TO SEPTEMBER 26, 2008. LEHMAN OTCS

PERFORMANCE UNDER THE CONTRACT WAS SECURED BY $1.0 BILLION OF

CASH COLLATERAL. UNDER THE TERMS OF THE CONTRACT, LEHMAN OTC WAS

OBLIGATED TO DELIVER APPROXIMATELY 50 MILLION SHARES OF OUR

COMMON STOCK TO US ON SEPTEMBER 29, 2008. LEHMAN FAILED TO

DELIVER ANY SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK, AND WE EXERCISED OUR

RIGHT TO SETOFF AGAINST THE $1.0 BILLION COLLATERAL. LEHMAN OTC

HAS NOT INITIATED ANY ACTION AGAINST US TO DATE, BUT IN FEBRUARY

2010, LEHMAN SERVED A SUBPOENA ON US IN CONNECTION WITH THIS

TRANSACTION. IN SEPTEMBER 2010, WE ENTERED INTO AN AGREEMENT

WITH LEHMAN THAT TOLLS ANY APPLICABLE STATUTES OF LIMITATIONS

FOR 90 DAYS AND PRECLUDES THE PARTIES FROM COMMENCING ANY FORMAL

PROCEEDINGS TO PROSECUTE ANY CLAIMS AGAINST EACH OTHER IN ANY

FORUM DURING THAT PERIOD. IN OCTOBER 2010, LEHMAN DEMANDED THAT

INTEL PAY IT AT LEAST $417 MILLION. WE CONTINUE TO BELIEVE THAT

WE ACTED APPROPRIATELY UNDER OUR AGREEMENT WITH LEHMAN OTC, AND

WE INTEND TO DEFEND ANY CLAIM TO THE CONTRARY. WE HAVE AGREED TO

EXTEND THE TOLLING AGREEMENT TWICE, AND IT IS NOW IN EFFECT

THROUGH MAY 2011.

JEAN-MARC VERDIELL, CLAIMING THAT MUCH OF LIGHTLOGICS

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY IS BASED ON ALLEGED INVENTIONS THAT SHUM

CONCEIVED WHILE HE AND VERDIELL WERE PARTNERS AT RADIANCE

SHUM ALSO SEEKS ALLEGED CORRECTION OF INVENTORSHIP OF SEVEN

PATENTS ACQUIRED BY US AS PART OF THE LIGHTLOGIC ACQUISITION. IN

JANUARY 2005, THE U.S. DISTRICT COURT FOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT

OF CALIFORNIA DENIED SHUMS INVENTORSHIP CLAIM, AND

THEREAFTER GRANTED OUR MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT ON

SHUMS REMAINING CLAIMS. IN AUGUST 2007, THE U.S. COURT OF

APPEALS FOR THE FEDERAL CIRCUIT VACATED THE DISTRICT

COURTS RULINGS AND REMANDED THE CASE FOR FURTHER

PROCEEDINGS. IN OCTOBER 2008, THE DISTRICT COURT GRANTED OUR

MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT ON SHUMS CLAIMS FOR BREACH OF

FIDUCIARY DUTY AND FRAUDULENT CONCEALMENT, BUT DENIED OUR MOTION

ON SHUMS REMAINING CLAIMS. A JURY TRIAL ON SHUMS

REMAINING CLAIMS TOOK PLACE IN NOVEMBER AND DECEMBER 2008. IN

PRE-TRIAL PROCEEDINGS AND AT TRIAL, SHUM REQUESTED MONETARY

DAMAGES AGAINST THE DEFENDANTS IN AMOUNTS RANGING FROM $31

MILLION TO $931 MILLION, AND HIS FINAL REQUEST TO THE JURY WAS

FOR AS MUCH AS $175 MILLION. FOLLOWING DELIBERATIONS, THE JURY

WAS UNABLE TO REACH A VERDICT ON MOST OF THE CLAIMS. WITH

RESPECT TO SHUMS CLAIM THAT HE IS THE PROPER INVENTOR ON

CERTAIN LIGHTLOGIC PATENTS NOW ASSIGNED TO US, THE JURY AGREED

WITH SHUM ON SOME OF THOSE CLAIMS AND WAS UNABLE TO REACH A

VERDICT REGARDING THE REMAINING CLAIMS. IN APRIL 2009, THE COURT

GRANTED DEFENDANTS MOTIONS FOR JUDGMENT AS A MATTER OF

LAW. SHUM APPEALED THAT RULING TO THE U.S. COURT OF APPEALS FOR

THE FEDERAL CIRCUIT, WHICH HEARD ORAL ARGUMENTS IN AUGUST 2010

THE

BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND STOCKHOLDERS OF INTEL

CORPORATION

WE HAVE AUDITED THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS OF

INTEL CORPORATION AS OF DECEMBER 25, 2010 AND DECEMBER 26, 2009,

AND THE RELATED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME,

STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY, AND CASH FLOWS FOR EACH OF THE THREE

YEARS IN THE PERIOD ENDED DECEMBER 25, 2010. OUR AUDITS ALSO

INCLUDED THE FINANCIAL STATEMENT SCHEDULE LISTED IN THE INDEX AT

PART IV, ITEM 15. THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SCHEDULE ARE

THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE COMPANYS MANAGEMENT. OUR

RESPONSIBILITY IS TO EXPRESS AN OPINION ON THESE FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS AND SCHEDULE BASED ON OUR AUDITS.

WE CONDUCTED OUR AUDITS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE STANDARDS OF THE

PUBLIC COMPANY ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BOARD (UNITED STATES). THOSE

STANDARDS REQUIRE THAT WE PLAN AND PERFORM THE AUDIT TO OBTAIN

REASONABLE ASSURANCE ABOUT WHETHER THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE

FREE OF MATERIAL MISSTATEMENT. AN AUDIT INCLUDES EXAMINING, ON A

TEST BASIS, EVIDENCE SUPPORTING THE AMOUNTS AND DISCLOSURES IN

THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. AN AUDIT ALSO INCLUDES ASSESSING THE

ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES USED AND SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES MADE BY

MANAGEMENT, AS WELL AS EVALUATING THE OVERALL FINANCIAL

STATEMENT PRESENTATION. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR AUDITS PROVIDE A

REASONABLE BASIS FOR OUR OPINION.

IN OUR OPINION, THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS REFERRED TO ABOVE

PRESENT FAIRLY, IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS, THE CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL POSITION OF INTEL CORPORATION AT DECEMBER 25, 2010 AND

DECEMBER 26, 2009, AND THE CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF ITS

OPERATIONS AND ITS CASH FLOWS FOR EACH OF THE THREE YEARS IN THE

PERIOD ENDED DECEMBER 25, 2010, IN CONFORMITY WITH U.S.

GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES. ALSO, IN OUR OPINION,

THE RELATED FINANCIAL STATEMENT SCHEDULE REFERRED TO ABOVE, WHEN

INFORMATION SET FORTH THEREIN.

WE ALSO HAVE AUDITED, IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE STANDARDS OF THE

ERNST & YOUNG LLP, INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING

FIRM

THE

BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND STOCKHOLDERS OF INTEL

CORPORATION

WE HAVE AUDITED INTEL CORPORATIONS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER

FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF DECEMBER 25, 2010, BASED ON CRITERIA

ESTABLISHED IN INTERNAL CONTROLINTEGRATED FRAMEWORK ISSUED

BY THE COMMITTEE OF SPONSORING ORGANIZATIONS OF THE TREADWAY

COMMISSION (THE COSO CRITERIA). INTEL CORPORATIONS

MANAGEMENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR MAINTAINING EFFECTIVE INTERNAL

CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, AND FOR ITS ASSESSMENT OF THE

EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

INCLUDED IN THE ACCOMPANYING MANAGEMENT REPORT ON INTERNAL

CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING. OUR RESPONSIBILITY IS TO

EXPRESS AN OPINION ON THE COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER

FINANCIAL REPORTING BASED ON OUR AUDIT.

WE CONDUCTED OUR AUDIT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE STANDARDS OF THE

PUBLIC COMPANY ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BOARD (UNITED STATES). THOSE

STANDARDS REQUIRE THAT WE PLAN AND PERFORM THE AUDIT TO OBTAIN

REASONABLE ASSURANCE ABOUT WHETHER EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL

OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING WAS MAINTAINED IN ALL MATERIAL

RESPECTS. OUR AUDIT INCLUDED OBTAINING AN UNDERSTANDING OF

INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, ASSESSING THE RISK

THAT A MATERIAL WEAKNESS EXISTS, TESTING AND EVALUATING THE

DESIGN AND OPERATING EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL CONTROL BASED ON

THE ASSESSED RISK, AND PERFORMING SUCH OTHER PROCEDURES AS WE

CONSIDERED NECESSARY IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR

AUDIT PROVIDES A REASONABLE BASIS FOR OUR OPINION.

A COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING IS A

PROCESS DESIGNED TO PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING THE

RELIABILITY OF FINANCIAL REPORTING AND THE PREPARATION OF

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR EXTERNAL PURPOSES IN ACCORDANCE WITH

GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES. A COMPANYS

INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING INCLUDES THOSE

POLICIES AND PROCEDURES THAT (1) PERTAIN TO THE MAINTENANCE OF

RECORDS THAT, IN REASONABLE DETAIL, ACCURATELY AND FAIRLY

REFLECT THE TRANSACTIONS AND DISPOSITIONS OF THE ASSETS OF THE

COMPANY; (2) PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE THAT TRANSACTIONS ARE

RECORDED AS NECESSARY TO PERMIT PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING

PRINCIPLES, AND THAT RECEIPTS AND EXPENDITURES OF THE COMPANY

ARE BEING MADE ONLY IN ACCORDANCE WITH AUTHORIZATIONS OF

MANAGEMENT AND DIRECTORS OF THE COMPANY; AND (3) PROVIDE

REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING PREVENTION OR TIMELY DETECTION OF

UNAUTHORIZED ACQUISITION, USE, OR DISPOSITION OF THE

COMPANYS ASSETS THAT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

BECAUSE OF ITS INHERENT LIMITATIONS, INTERNAL CONTROL OVER

FINANCIAL REPORTING MAY NOT PREVENT OR DETECT MISSTATEMENTS.

ALSO, PROJECTIONS OF ANY EVALUATION OF EFFECTIVENESS TO FUTURE

PERIODS ARE SUBJECT TO THE RISK THAT CONTROLS MAY BECOME

INADEQUATE BECAUSE OF CHANGES IN CONDITIONS, OR THAT THE DEGREE

OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE POLICIES OR PROCEDURES MAY DETERIORATE.

IN OUR OPINION, INTEL CORPORATION MAINTAINED, IN ALL MATERIAL

RESPECTS, EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS

OF DECEMBER 25, 2010, BASED ON THE COSO CRITERIA.

WE ALSO HAVE AUDITED, IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE STANDARDS OF THE

PUBLIC COMPANY ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BOARD (UNITED STATES), THE

2010 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF INTEL CORPORATION AND

OUR REPORT DATED FEBRUARY 18, 2011 EXPRESSED AN UNQUALIFIED

OPINION THEREON.

UNDER THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934, AS AMENDED (THE

REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

OUR MANAGEMENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ESTABLISHING AND MAINTAINING

ADEQUATE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING (AS DEFINED

IN RULES

13A-15(F)

AND

15D-15(F)

UNDER THE EXCHANGE ACT) TO PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE

REGARDING THE RELIABILITY OF OUR FINANCIAL REPORTING AND THE

PREPARATION OF CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR EXTERNAL

PURPOSES IN ACCORDANCE WITH U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING

PRINCIPLES.

MANAGEMENT ASSESSED OUR INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL

REPORTING AS OF DECEMBER 25, 2010, THE END OF OUR FISCAL YEAR.

MANAGEMENT BASED ITS ASSESSMENT ON CRITERIA ESTABLISHED IN

INTERNAL CONTROLINTEGRATED FRAMEWORK ISSUED BY THE

COMMITTEE OF SPONSORING ORGANIZATIONS OF THE TREADWAY

COMMISSION. MANAGEMENTS ASSESSMENT INCLUDED EVALUATION OF

ELEMENTS SUCH AS THE DESIGN AND OPERATING EFFECTIVENESS OF KEY

FINANCIAL REPORTING CONTROLS, PROCESS DOCUMENTATION, ACCOUNTING

POLICIES, AND OUR OVERALL CONTROL ENVIRONMENT.

BASED ON OUR ASSESSMENT, MANAGEMENT HAS CONCLUDED THAT OUR

INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING WAS EFFECTIVE AS OF

THE END OF THE FISCAL YEAR TO PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE

REGARDING THE RELIABILITY OF FINANCIAL REPORTING AND THE

PREPARATION OF CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR EXTERNAL

REPORTING PURPOSES IN ACCORDANCE WITH U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED

ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES. WE REVIEWED THE RESULTS OF

MANAGEMENTS ASSESSMENT WITH THE AUDIT COMMITTEE OF OUR

BOARD OF DIRECTORS.

OUR INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM, ERNST &

YOUNG LLP, INDEPENDENTLY ASSESSED THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE

COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, AS

STATED IN THEIR ATTESTATION REPORT, WHICH IS INCLUDED AT THE END

OF PART II, ITEM 8 OF THIS FORM

10-K.

INHERENT

LIMITATIONS ON EFFECTIVENESS OF CONTROLS

OUR MANAGEMENT, INCLUDING THE CEO AND CFO, DOES NOT EXPECT THAT

OUR DISCLOSURE CONTROLS OR OUR INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL

REPORTING WILL PREVENT OR DETECT ALL ERROR AND ALL FRAUD. A

CONTROL SYSTEM, NO MATTER HOW WELL DESIGNED AND OPERATED, CAN

PROVIDE ONLY REASONABLE, NOT ABSOLUTE, ASSURANCE THAT THE

CONTROL SYSTEMS OBJECTIVES WILL BE MET. THE DESIGN OF A

CONTROL SYSTEM MUST REFLECT THE FACT THAT THERE ARE RESOURCE

CONSTRAINTS, AND THE BENEFITS OF CONTROLS MUST BE CONSIDERED

RELATIVE TO THEIR COSTS. FURTHER, BECAUSE OF THE INHERENT

LIMITATIONS IN ALL CONTROL SYSTEMS, NO EVALUATION OF CONTROLS

CAN PROVIDE ABSOLUTE ASSURANCE THAT MISSTATEMENTS DUE TO ERROR

OR FRAUD WILL NOT OCCUR OR THAT ALL CONTROL ISSUES AND INSTANCES

OF FRAUD, IF ANY, HAVE BEEN DETECTED. THE DESIGN OF ANY SYSTEM

OF CONTROLS IS BASED IN PART ON CERTAIN ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT THE

LIKELIHOOD OF FUTURE EVENTS, AND THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT

ANY DESIGN WILL SUCCEED IN ACHIEVING ITS STATED GOALS UNDER ALL

POTENTIAL FUTURE CONDITIONS. PROJECTIONS OF ANY EVALUATION OF

THE EFFECTIVENESS OF CONTROLS TO FUTURE PERIODS ARE SUBJECT TO

RISKS. OVER TIME, CONTROLS MAY BECOME INADEQUATE BECAUSE OF

CHANGES IN CONDITIONS OR DETERIORATION IN THE DEGREE OF

COMPLIANCE WITH POLICIES OR PROCEDURES.
