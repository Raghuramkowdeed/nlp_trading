WE EXPECT TO INCREASE THE CAPACITY

OF CERTAIN FACILITIES LISTED ABOVE THROUGH ADDITIONAL

INVESTMENTS IN CAPITAL EQUIPMENT. IN ADDITION TO OUR CURRENT

FACILITIES, WE ARE BUILDING A 300MM WAFER FABRICATION FACILITY

IN CHINA. SUBSEQUENT TO THE END OF 2008, MANAGEMENT APPROVED

PLANS TO RESTRUCTURE SOME OF OUR MANUFACTURING AND ASSEMBLY AND

TEST OPERATIONS, AND ALIGN OUR MANUFACTURING AND ASSEMBLY AND

TEST CAPACITY TO CURRENT MARKET CONDITIONS. THESE ACTIONS, WHICH

ARE EXPECTED TO TAKE PLACE BEGINNING IN 2009, INCLUDE STOPPING

PRODUCTION AT A 200MM WAFER FABRICATION FACILITY IN OREGON AND

ENDING PRODUCTION AT OUR 200MM WAFER FABRICATION FACILITY IN

CALIFORNIA.

AS OF DECEMBER 27, 2008, THE

SUBSTANTIAL MAJORITY OF OUR MICROPROCESSORS WERE MANUFACTURED ON

300MM WAFERS USING OUR 45NM PROCESS TECHNOLOGY. IN THE SECOND

HALF OF 2009, WE EXPECT TO BEGIN MANUFACTURING MICROPROCESSORS

USING OUR 32NM PROCESS TECHNOLOGY. AS WE MOVE TO EACH SUCCEEDING

GENERATION OF MANUFACTURING PROCESS TECHNOLOGY, WE INCUR

SIGNIFICANT

START-UP

COSTS TO PREPARE EACH FACTORY FOR MANUFACTURING. HOWEVER,

CONTINUING TO ADVANCE OUR PROCESS TECHNOLOGY PROVIDES BENEFITS

THAT WE BELIEVE JUSTIFY THESE COSTS. THE BENEFITS OF MOVING TO

EACH SUCCEEDING GENERATION OF MANUFACTURING PROCESS TECHNOLOGY

CAN INCLUDE USING LESS SPACE PER TRANSISTOR, REDUCING HEAT

OUTPUT FROM EACH TRANSISTOR,

AND/OR

INCREASING THE NUMBER OF INTEGRATED FEATURES ON EACH CHIP. THESE

ADVANCEMENTS CAN RESULT IN MICROPROCESSORS THAT ARE HIGHER

PERFORMING, CONSUME LESS POWER,

AND/OR

COST

LESS TO MANUFACTURE.

TO AUGMENT CAPACITY, WE USE

THIRD-PARTY MANUFACTURING COMPANIES (FOUNDRIES) TO MANUFACTURE

WAFERS FOR CERTAIN COMPONENTS, INCLUDING NETWORKING AND

COMMUNICATIONS PRODUCTS. IN ADDITION, WE PRIMARILY USE

SUBCONTRACTORS TO MANUFACTURE BOARD-LEVEL PRODUCTS AND SYSTEMS,

AND PURCHASE CERTAIN COMMUNICATIONS NETWORKING PRODUCTS FROM

EXTERNAL VENDORS, PRINCIPALLY IN THE ASIA-PACIFIC REGION.

OUR NAND FLASH MEMORY PRODUCTS ARE

MANUFACTURED BY IMFT, A NAND FLASH MEMORY MANUFACTURING COMPANY

THAT WE FORMED WITH MICRON TECHNOLOGY, INC. WE CURRENTLY

PURCHASE 49% OF THE MANUFACTURED OUTPUT OF IMFT. ASSEMBLY AND

TEST OF NAND FLASH MEMORY PRODUCTS IS PERFORMED BY MICRON AND

OTHER EXTERNAL SUBCONTRACTORS. SEE NOTE 6: EQUITY METHOD

AND COST METHOD INVESTMENTS IN PART II, ITEM 8 OF THIS

FORM

10-K.

DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2008,

WE COMPLETED THE DIVESTITURE OF OUR NOR FLASH MEMORY BUSINESS IN

EXCHANGE FOR AN OWNERSHIP INTEREST IN NUMONYX B.V. WE ENTERED

INTO SUPPLY AND SERVICES AGREEMENTS THAT INVOLVED THE

MANUFACTURE AND THE ASSEMBLY AND TEST OF NOR FLASH MEMORY

PRODUCTS FOR NUMONYX THROUGH 2008. IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF

2008, WE AGREED WITH NUMONYX TO EXTEND CERTAIN SUPPLY AND

SERVICE AGREEMENTS THROUGH THE END OF 2009. IN ADDITION, WE ARE

LEASING A WAFER FABRICATION FACILITY LOCATED IN ISRAEL TO

NUMONYX. THAT FACILITY IS NOT SHOWN IN OUR ABOVE LISTING OF

WAFER FABRICATION FACILITIES. SEE NOTE 6: EQUITY METHOD

AND COST METHOD INVESTMENTS IN PART II, ITEM 8 OF THIS

FORM

FOLLOWING THE MANUFACTURING

PROCESS, THE MAJORITY OF OUR COMPONENTS ARE SUBJECT TO ASSEMBLY

AND TEST. WE PERFORM OUR COMPONENTS ASSEMBLY AND TEST AT

FACILITIES IN MALAYSIA, CHINA, COSTA RICA, AND THE PHILIPPINES.

WE ARE BUILDING A NEW ASSEMBLY AND TEST FACILITY IN VIETNAM THAT

IS EXPECTED TO BEGIN PRODUCTION IN 2010. TO AUGMENT CAPACITY, WE

USE SUBCONTRACTORS TO PERFORM ASSEMBLY OF CERTAIN PRODUCTS,

PRIMARILY CHIPSETS AND NETWORKING AND COMMUNICATIONS PRODUCTS.

THE RESTRUCTURING PLANS DESCRIBED ABOVE INCLUDE CLOSING TWO

ASSEMBLY AND TEST FACILITIES IN MALAYSIA, ONE FACILITY IN THE

PHILIPPINES, AND ONE FACILITY IN CHINA, AND ARE EXPECTED TO TAKE

PLACE BEGINNING IN 2009.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

OUR EMPLOYMENT PRACTICES ARE

CONSISTENT WITH, AND WE EXPECT OUR SUPPLIERS AND SUBCONTRACTORS

TO ABIDE BY, LOCAL COUNTRY LAW. IN ADDITION, WE IMPOSE A MINIMUM

EMPLOYEE AGE REQUIREMENT AS WELL AS PROGRESSIVE ENVIRONMENTAL,

HEALTH, AND SAFETY (EHS) REQUIREMENTS, REGARDLESS OF LOCAL LAW.

WE HAVE THOUSANDS OF SUPPLIERS,

INCLUDING SUBCONTRACTORS, PROVIDING OUR VARIOUS MATERIALS AND

SERVICE NEEDS. WE SET EXPECTATIONS FOR SUPPLIER PERFORMANCE AND

REINFORCE THOSE EXPECTATIONS WITH PERIODIC ASSESSMENTS. WE

COMMUNICATE THOSE EXPECTATIONS TO OUR SUPPLIERS REGULARLY AND

WORK WITH THEM TO IMPLEMENT IMPROVEMENTS WHEN NECESSARY. WE

SEEK, WHERE POSSIBLE, TO HAVE SEVERAL SOURCES OF SUPPLY FOR ALL

OF THESE MATERIALS AND RESOURCES, BUT WE MAY RELY ON A SINGLE OR

LIMITED NUMBER OF SUPPLIERS, OR UPON SUPPLIERS IN A SINGLE

COUNTRY. IN THOSE CASES, WE DEVELOP AND IMPLEMENT PLANS AND

ACTIONS TO REDUCE THE EXPOSURE THAT WOULD RESULT FROM A

DISRUPTION IN SUPPLY. WE HAVE ENTERED INTO LONG-TERM CONTRACTS

WITH CERTAIN SUPPLIERS TO ENSURE A PORTION OF OUR SILICON SUPPLY.

OUR PRODUCTS TYPICALLY ARE

PRODUCED AT MULTIPLE INTEL FACILITIES AT VARIOUS SITES AROUND

THE WORLD, OR BY SUBCONTRACTORS WHO HAVE MULTIPLE FACILITIES.

HOWEVER, SOME PRODUCTS ARE PRODUCED IN ONLY ONE INTEL OR

SUBCONTRACTOR FACILITY, AND WE SEEK TO IMPLEMENT ACTIONS AND

PLANS TO REDUCE THE EXPOSURE THAT WOULD RESULT FROM A DISRUPTION

AT ANY SUCH FACILITY. SEE RISK FACTORS IN PART I,

RESEARCH

AND DEVELOPMENT

WE ARE COMMITTED TO INVESTING IN

WORLD-CLASS TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT, PARTICULARLY IN THE DESIGN

AND MANUFACTURE OF INTEGRATED CIRCUITS. RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

(R&D) EXPENDITURES IN 2008 WERE $5.7 BILLION ($5.8 BILLION

IN FISCAL YEAR 2007 AND $5.9 BILLION IN FISCAL YEAR 2006).

OUR R&D ACTIVITIES ARE

DIRECTED TOWARD DEVELOPING THE TECHNOLOGY INNOVATIONS THAT WE

BELIEVE WILL DELIVER OUR NEXT GENERATION OF PRODUCTS AND

PLATFORMS, WHICH WILL IN TURN ENABLE NEW FORM FACTORS AND NEW

USAGE MODELS FOR BUSINESSES AND CONSUMERS. OUR R&D

ACTIVITIES RANGE FROM DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT OF PRODUCTS, TO

DEVELOPING AND REFINING MANUFACTURING PROCESSES, TO RESEARCHING

FUTURE TECHNOLOGIES AND PRODUCTS.

WE ARE FOCUSING OUR R&D

EFFORTS ON ADVANCED COMPUTING, COMMUNICATIONS, AND WIRELESS

TECHNOLOGIES AS WELL AS ENERGY EFFICIENCY BY DEVELOPING NEW

MICROARCHITECTURES, ADVANCING OUR SILICON MANUFACTURING PROCESS

TECHNOLOGY, DELIVERING THE NEXT GENERATION OF MICROPROCESSORS

AND CHIPSETS, IMPROVING OUR PLATFORM INITIATIVES, AND DEVELOPING

SOFTWARE SOLUTIONS AND TOOLS TO SUPPORT OUR TECHNOLOGIES. OUR

R&D EFFORTS ENABLE NEW LEVELS OF PERFORMANCE AND ADDRESS

AREAS SUCH AS SCALABILITY FOR MULTI-CORE ARCHITECTURES, ENERGY

EFFICIENCY, SYSTEM MANAGEABILITY AND SECURITY, EASE OF USE, AND

NEW COMMUNICATIONS CAPABILITIES. IN ADDITION, WE ARE MAKING

SIGNIFICANT R&D INVESTMENTS IN GROWTH AREAS SUCH AS SOC,

MIDS, EMBEDDED APPLICATIONS, CONSUMER ELECTRONICS, AND GRAPHICS.

AS PART OF OUR R&D EFFORTS,

WE PLAN TO INTRODUCE A NEW MICROARCHITECTURE FOR OUR MOBILE,

DESKTOP, AND INTEL XEON PROCESSORS APPROXIMATELY EVERY TWO YEARS

AND RAMP THE NEXT GENERATION OF SILICON PROCESS TECHNOLOGY IN

THE INTERVENING YEARS. WE REFER TO THIS AS OUR

TICK-TOCK TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT CADENCE. OUR

LEADERSHIP IN SILICON TECHNOLOGY HAS ENABLED US TO MAKE

MOORES LAW A REALITY. MOORES LAW

PREDICTED THAT TRANSISTOR DENSITY ON INTEGRATED CIRCUITS WOULD

DOUBLE ABOUT EVERY TWO YEARS. OUR LEADERSHIP IN SILICON

TECHNOLOGY HAS ALSO HELPED TO EXPAND ON THE ADVANCES ANTICIPATED

BY MOORES LAW BY BRINGING NEW CAPABILITIES INTO SILICON

AND PRODUCING NEW PRODUCTS AND PLATFORMS OPTIMIZED FOR A WIDER

VARIETY OF APPLICATIONS. IN 2008, WE INTRODUCED A NEW

MICROARCHITECTURE USING OUR 45NM PROCESS TECHNOLOGY. WE ARE

CURRENTLY DEVELOPING 32NM PROCESS TECHNOLOGY, OUR

NEXT-GENERATION PROCESS TECHNOLOGY, AND EXPECT TO BEGIN

MANUFACTURING PRODUCTS USING THAT TECHNOLOGY IN THE SECOND HALF

OF 2009.

OUR R&D MODEL IS BASED ON A

GLOBAL ORGANIZATION THAT EMPHASIZES A COLLABORATIVE APPROACH TO

IDENTIFYING AND DEVELOPING NEW TECHNOLOGIES, LEADING STANDARDS

INITIATIVES, AND INFLUENCING REGULATORY POLICY TO ACCELERATE THE

ADOPTION OF NEW TECHNOLOGIES. OUR R&D INITIATIVES ARE

PERFORMED BY VARIOUS BUSINESS GROUPS WITHIN THE COMPANY, AND WE

CENTRALLY MANAGE KEY CROSS-BUSINESS GROUP PRODUCT INITIATIVES TO

ALIGN AND PRIORITIZE OUR R&D ACTIVITIES ACROSS THESE

GROUPS. IN ADDITION, WE MAY AUGMENT OUR R&D INITIATIVES BY

INVESTING IN COMPANIES OR ENTERING INTO AGREEMENTS WITH

COMPANIES THAT HAVE SIMILAR R&D FOCUS AREAS. FOR EXAMPLE,

WE HAVE AN AGREEMENT WITH MICRON FOR JOINT DEVELOPMENT OF NAND

FLASH MEMORY TECHNOLOGIES.

SALES AND

MARKETING

CUSTOMERS

WE SELL OUR PRODUCTS PRIMARILY TO

ORIGINAL EQUIPMENT MANUFACTURERS (OEMS) AND ORIGINAL DESIGN

MANUFACTURERS (ODMS). ODMS PROVIDE DESIGN

AND/OR

MANUFACTURING SERVICES TO BRANDED AND UNBRANDED PRIVATE-LABEL

RESELLERS. IN ADDITION, WE SELL OUR PRODUCTS TO OTHER

MANUFACTURERS, INCLUDING MAKERS OF A WIDE RANGE OF INDUSTRIAL

AND COMMUNICATIONS EQUIPMENT. OUR CUSTOMERS ALSO INCLUDE PC AND

NETWORK COMMUNICATIONS PRODUCTS USERS WHO BUY PC COMPONENTS AND

OUR OTHER PRODUCTS THROUGH DISTRIBUTOR, RESELLER, RETAIL, AND

OEM CHANNELS THROUGHOUT THE WORLD. IN CERTAIN INSTANCES, WE HAVE

ENTERED INTO SUPPLY AGREEMENTS TO CONTINUE TO MANUFACTURE AND

SELL PRODUCTS OF DIVESTED BUSINESS LINES TO ACQUIRING COMPANIES

DURING CERTAIN TRANSITION PERIODS.

OUR WORLDWIDE RESELLER SALES

CHANNEL CONSISTS OF THOUSANDS OF INDIRECT CUSTOMERS WHO ARE

SYSTEMS BUILDERS THAT PURCHASE INTEL MICROPROCESSORS AND OTHER

PRODUCTS FROM OUR DISTRIBUTORS. WE HAVE A BOXED PROCESSOR

PROGRAM THAT ALLOWS DISTRIBUTORS TO SELL INTEL MICROPROCESSORS

IN SMALL QUANTITIES TO THESE SYSTEMS-BUILDER CUSTOMERS; BOXED

PROCESSORS ARE ALSO AVAILABLE IN DIRECT RETAIL OUTLETS.

IN 2008, HEWLETT-PACKARD COMPANY

ACCOUNTED FOR 20% OF OUR NET REVENUE (17% IN 2007) AND DELL

INC. ACCOUNTED FOR 18% OF OUR NET REVENUE (18% IN 2007). NO

OTHER CUSTOMER ACCOUNTED FOR MORE THAN 10% OF OUR NET REVENUE.

SALES

ARRANGEMENTS

OUR PRODUCTS ARE SOLD OR LICENSED

THROUGH SALES OFFICES THROUGHOUT THE WORLD. SALES OF OUR

PRODUCTS ARE TYPICALLY MADE VIA PURCHASE ORDERS THAT CONTAIN

STANDARD TERMS AND CONDITIONS COVERING MATTERS SUCH AS PRICING,

PAYMENT TERMS, AND WARRANTIES, AS WELL AS INDEMNITIES FOR ISSUES

SPECIFIC TO OUR PRODUCTS, SUCH AS PATENT AND COPYRIGHT

INDEMNITIES. FROM TIME TO TIME, WE MAY ENTER INTO ADDITIONAL

AGREEMENTS WITH CUSTOMERS COVERING, FOR EXAMPLE, CHANGES FROM

OUR STANDARD TERMS AND CONDITIONS, NEW PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT AND

MARKETING, PRIVATE-LABEL BRANDING, AND OTHER MATTERS. MOST OF

OUR SALES ARE MADE USING ELECTRONIC AND WEB-BASED PROCESSES THAT

ALLOW THE CUSTOMER TO REVIEW INVENTORY AVAILABILITY AND TRACK

THE PROGRESS OF SPECIFIC GOODS ORDERED. PRICING ON PARTICULAR

PRODUCTS MAY VARY BASED ON VOLUMES ORDERED AND OTHER FACTORS. WE

ALSO OFFER DISCOUNTS, REBATES, AND OTHER INCENTIVES TO CUSTOMERS

TO INCREASE ACCEPTANCE OF OUR PRODUCTS AND TECHNOLOGY.

OUR PRODUCTS ARE TYPICALLY SHIPPED

UNDER TERMS THAT TRANSFER TITLE TO THE CUSTOMER, EVEN IN

ARRANGEMENTS FOR WHICH THE RECOGNITION OF REVENUE AND RELATED

COSTS OF SALES IS DEFERRED. OUR STANDARD TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF

SALE TYPICALLY PROVIDE THAT PAYMENT IS DUE AT A LATER DATE,

GENERALLY 30 DAYS AFTER SHIPMENT, DELIVERY, OR THE

CUSTOMERS USE OF THE PRODUCT. OUR CREDIT DEPARTMENT SETS

ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND SHIPPING LIMITS FOR INDIVIDUAL CUSTOMERS

TO CONTROL CREDIT RISK TO INTEL ARISING FROM OUTSTANDING ACCOUNT

BALANCES. WE ASSESS CREDIT RISK THROUGH QUANTITATIVE AND

QUALITATIVE ANALYSIS, AND FROM THIS ANALYSIS, WE ESTABLISH

CREDIT LIMITS AND DETERMINE WHETHER WE WILL SEEK TO USE ONE OR

MORE CREDIT SUPPORT DEVICES, SUCH AS OBTAINING SOME FORM OF

THIRD-PARTY GUARANTY OR STANDBY LETTER OF CREDIT, OR OBTAINING

CREDIT INSURANCE FOR ALL OR A PORTION OF THE ACCOUNT BALANCE IF

NECESSARY. CREDIT LOSSES MAY STILL BE INCURRED DUE TO

BANKRUPTCY, FRAUD, OR OTHER FAILURE OF THE CUSTOMER TO PAY. FOR

INFORMATION ABOUT OUR ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL RECEIVABLES, SEE

SCHEDULE IIVALUATION AND QUALIFYING

ACCOUNTS IN PART IV OF THIS

FORM 10-K.

MOST OF OUR SALES TO DISTRIBUTORS

ARE MADE UNDER AGREEMENTS ALLOWING FOR PRICE PROTECTION ON

UNSOLD MERCHANDISE AND A RIGHT OF RETURN ON STIPULATED

QUANTITIES OF UNSOLD MERCHANDISE. UNDER THE PRICE PROTECTION

PROGRAM, WE GIVE DISTRIBUTORS CREDITS FOR THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN

THE ORIGINAL PRICE PAID AND THE CURRENT PRICE THAT WE OFFER. ON

MOST PRODUCTS, THERE IS NO CONTRACTUAL LIMIT ON THE AMOUNT OF

PRICE PROTECTION, NOR IS THERE A LIMIT ON THE TIME HORIZON UNDER

WHICH PRICE PROTECTION IS GRANTED. THE RIGHT OF RETURN GRANTED

GENERALLY CONSISTS OF A STOCK ROTATION PROGRAM IN WHICH

DISTRIBUTORS ARE ABLE TO EXCHANGE CERTAIN PRODUCTS BASED ON THE

NUMBER OF QUALIFIED PURCHASES MADE BY THE DISTRIBUTOR. ALTHOUGH

WE HAVE THE OPTION TO GRANT CREDIT FOR, REPAIR, OR REPLACE

DEFECTIVE PRODUCT, THERE IS NO CONTRACTUAL LIMIT ON THE AMOUNT

OF CREDIT GRANTED TO A DISTRIBUTOR.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

DISTRIBUTION

TYPICALLY, DISTRIBUTORS HANDLE A

WIDE VARIETY OF PRODUCTS, INCLUDING THOSE THAT COMPETE WITH OUR

PRODUCTS, AND FILL ORDERS FOR MANY CUSTOMERS. WE ALSO UTILIZE

THIRD-PARTY SALES REPRESENTATIVES WHO GENERALLY DO NOT OFFER

DIRECTLY COMPETITIVE PRODUCTS BUT MAY CARRY COMPLEMENTARY ITEMS

MANUFACTURED BY OTHERS. SALES REPRESENTATIVES DO NOT MAINTAIN A

PRODUCT INVENTORY; INSTEAD, THEIR CUSTOMERS PLACE ORDERS

DIRECTLY WITH US OR THROUGH DISTRIBUTORS.

BACKLOG

WE DO NOT BELIEVE THAT BACKLOG AS

OF ANY PARTICULAR DATE IS MEANINGFUL, AS OUR SALES ARE MADE

PRIMARILY PURSUANT TO STANDARD PURCHASE ORDERS FOR DELIVERY OF

PRODUCTS. ONLY A SMALL PORTION OF OUR ORDERS IS NON-CANCELABLE,

AND THE DOLLAR AMOUNT ASSOCIATED WITH THE NON-CANCELABLE PORTION

IS NOT SIGNIFICANT.

SEASONAL

TRENDS

OUR MICROPROCESSOR SALES GENERALLY

HAVE FOLLOWED A SEASONAL TREND. HISTORICALLY, OUR SALES HAVE

BEEN HIGHER IN THE SECOND HALF OF THE YEAR THAN IN THE FIRST

HALF OF THE YEAR. CONSUMER PURCHASES OF PCS HAVE HISTORICALLY

BEEN HIGHER IN THE SECOND HALF OF THE YEAR, PRIMARILY DUE TO

BACK-TO-SCHOOL AND HOLIDAY DEMAND. IN ADDITION, PURCHASES FROM

BUSINESSES HAVE ALSO HISTORICALLY TENDED TO BE HIGHER IN THE

SECOND HALF OF THE YEAR. THIS SEASONAL TREND DID NOT OCCUR IN

2008, AND THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT IT WILL RESUME IN THE

FUTURE.

MARKETING

OUR CORPORATE MARKETING OBJECTIVES

ARE TO BUILD A STRONG INTEL CORPORATE BRAND THAT CONNECTS WITH

CONSUMERS, AND HAVE A LIMITED SET OF PRODUCT BRANDS FOR OUR

ADVANCED MICROPROCESSORS AND RELATED TECHNOLOGIES. OUR INTENTION

IS TO HAVE A LIMITED NUMBER OF MEANINGFUL AND VALUABLE BRANDS IN

OUR PORTFOLIO TO AID IN MAKING INFORMED CHOICES AND MAKING

TECHNOLOGY PURCHASE DECISIONS EASIER FOR BOTH BUSINESSES AND

CONSUMERS. THE INTEL CORE I7, INTEL CORE 2 EXTREME, INTEL CORE 2

QUAD, INTEL CORE 2 DUO, INTEL ATOM, PENTIUM, CELERON, INTEL

XEON, AND ITANIUM TRADEMARKS MAKE UP OUR PROCESSOR BRANDS.

MICROPROCESSORS ARE AT THE CENTER OF OUR MOST ADVANCED PROCESSOR

TECHNOLOGIES, WHICH INCLUDE INTEL CENTRINO PROCESSOR TECHNOLOGY

AND INTEL CORE 2 PROCESSORS WITH VPRO TECHNOLOGY.

WE PROMOTE BRAND AWARENESS AND

GENERATE DEMAND THROUGH OUR OWN DIRECT MARKETING AS WELL AS

CO-MARKETING PROGRAMS. OUR DIRECT MARKETING ACTIVITIES INCLUDE

TELEVISION, PRINT AND WEB-BASED ADVERTISING, AS WELL AS PRESS

RELATIONS, CONSUMER AND TRADE EVENTS, AND INDUSTRY AND CONSUMER

COMMUNICATIONS. WE MARKET TO CONSUMER AND BUSINESS AUDIENCES,

AND FOCUS ON BUILDING AWARENESS AND GENERATING DEMAND FOR

INCREASED PERFORMANCE, POWER EFFICIENCY, AND NEW CAPABILITIES.

PURCHASES BY CUSTOMERS OFTEN ALLOW

THEM TO PARTICIPATE IN COOPERATIVE ADVERTISING AND MARKETING

PROGRAMS SUCH AS THE INTEL

INSIDE

®

PROGRAM. THIS PROGRAM BROADENS THE REACH OF OUR BRANDS BEYOND

THE SCOPE OF OUR OWN DIRECT ADVERTISING. THROUGH THE INTEL

INSIDE PROGRAM, CERTAIN CUSTOMERS ARE LICENSED TO PLACE INTEL

LOGOS ON COMPUTERS CONTAINING OUR MICROPROCESSORS AND PROCESSOR

TECHNOLOGIES, AND TO USE OUR BRANDS IN MARKETING ACTIVITIES. THE

PROGRAM INCLUDES A MARKET DEVELOPMENT COMPONENT THAT ACCRUES

FUNDS BASED ON PURCHASES AND PARTIALLY REIMBURSES THE OEMS FOR

MARKETING ACTIVITIES FOR PRODUCTS FEATURING INTEL BRANDS,

SUBJECT TO THE OEMS MEETING DEFINED CRITERIA. THESE MARKETING

ACTIVITIES PRIMARILY INCLUDE TELEVISION, WEB-BASED MARKETING,

AND PRINT; AND IN THE BEGINNING OF 2008, WE INCREASED OUR FOCUS

ON WEB-BASED MARKETING. WE HAVE ALSO ENTERED INTO JOINT

MARKETING ARRANGEMENTS WITH CERTAIN CUSTOMERS.

COMPETITION

THE SEMICONDUCTOR INDUSTRY IS

DYNAMIC, CHARACTERIZED BY RAPID ADVANCES IN TECHNOLOGY AND

FREQUENT PRODUCT INTRODUCTIONS. AS UNIT VOLUMES OF A PRODUCT

GROW, PRODUCTION EXPERIENCE IS ACCUMULATED AND COSTS TYPICALLY

DECREASE, FURTHER COMPETITION DEVELOPS, AND PRICES DECLINE. THE

LIFE CYCLE OF OUR PRODUCTS IS VERY SHORT, SOMETIMES LESS THAN A

YEAR. THESE SHORT PRODUCT LIFE CYCLES AND OTHER FACTORS LEAD TO

FREQUENT NEGOTIATIONS WITH OUR OEM CUSTOMERS, WHICH TYPICALLY

ARE LARGE, SOPHISTICATED BUYERS WHO ARE ALSO OPERATING IN VERY

COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENTS. OUR ABILITY TO COMPETE DEPENDS ON OUR

ABILITY TO NAVIGATE THIS ENVIRONMENT, BY IMPROVING OUR PRODUCTS

AND PROCESSES FASTER THAN OUR COMPETITORS, ANTICIPATING CHANGING

CUSTOMER REQUIREMENTS, DEVELOPING AND LAUNCHING NEW PRODUCTS AND

PLATFORMS, PRICING OUR PRODUCTS COMPETITIVELY, AND REDUCING

AVERAGE UNIT COSTS. SEE RISK FACTORS IN PART I,

ITEM 1A OF THIS

FORM 10-K.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

OUR PRODUCTS COMPETE PRIMARILY

BASED ON PERFORMANCE, FEATURES, PRICE, QUALITY, RELIABILITY,

BRAND RECOGNITION, AND AVAILABILITY. WE ARE FOCUSED ON OFFERING

INNOVATIVE PRODUCTS AND WORLDWIDE SUPPORT FOR OUR CUSTOMERS AT

COMPETITIVE PRICES, INCLUDING PROVIDING IMPROVED

ENERGY-EFFICIENT PERFORMANCE, ENHANCED SECURITY, MANAGEABILITY,

AND INTEGRATED SOLUTIONS. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR PLATFORM STRATEGY

PROVIDES US WITH A COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE. WE OFFER PLATFORMS

THAT INCORPORATE VARIOUS COMPONENTS DESIGNED AND CONFIGURED TO

WORK TOGETHER TO PROVIDE AN OPTIMIZED USER COMPUTING SOLUTION

COMPARED TO COMPONENTS THAT ARE USED SEPARATELY.

OUR COMPETITORS RANGE IN SIZE FROM

LARGE ESTABLISHED MULTINATIONAL COMPANIES WITH MULTIPLE PRODUCT

LINES TO SMALLER COMPANIES AND NEW ENTRANTS TO THE MARKETPLACE

THAT COMPETE IN SPECIALIZED MARKET SEGMENTS. SOME OF OUR

COMPETITORS MAY HAVE DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENTS WITH OTHER

COMPANIES, AND IN SOME CASES OUR COMPETITORS MAY ALSO BE OUR

CUSTOMERS OR SUPPLIERS. PRODUCT OFFERINGS MAY CROSS OVER INTO

MULTIPLE PRODUCT CATEGORIES, PROVIDING US WITH NEW OPPORTUNITIES

BUT ALSO RESULTING IN MORE COMPETITION. IT MAY BE DIFFICULT FOR

US TO COMPETE IN MARKET SEGMENTS IN WHICH OUR COMPETITORS HAVE

ESTABLISHED PRODUCTS AND BRAND RECOGNITION.

WE BELIEVE THAT OUR NETWORK OF

MANUFACTURING FACILITIES AND ASSEMBLY AND TEST FACILITIES GIVES

US A COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE. THIS NETWORK ENABLES US TO HAVE MORE

DIRECT CONTROL OVER OUR PROCESSES, QUALITY CONTROL, PRODUCT

COST, VOLUME, TIMING OF PRODUCTION, AND OTHER FACTORS. THESE

FACILITIES REQUIRE SIGNIFICANT UP-FRONT CAPITAL SPENDING, AND

MANY OF OUR COMPETITORS DO NOT OWN SUCH FACILITIES BECAUSE THEY

MAY NOT BE ABLE TO AFFORD TO DO SO OR BECAUSE THEIR BUSINESS

MODELS INVOLVE THE USE OF THIRD-PARTY FACILITIES FOR

MANUFACTURING AND ASSEMBLY AND TEST. THESE FABLESS

SEMICONDUCTOR COMPANIES INCLUDE BROADCOM CORPORATION,

NVIDIA CORPORATION, QUALCOMM INCORPORATED, AND VIA TECHNOLOGIES,

INC. (VIA). SOME OF OUR COMPETITORS OWN PORTIONS OF SUCH

FACILITIES THROUGH INVESTMENT OR JOINT-VENTURE ARRANGEMENTS WITH

OTHER COMPANIES. ADVANCED MICRO DEVICES, INC. (AMD) INTENDS TO

SELL AN INTEREST IN ITS MANUFACTURING OPERATIONS.

A GROUP OF FOUNDRIES AND ASSEMBLY

AND TEST SUBCONTRACTORS OFFERS THEIR SERVICES TO COMPANIES THAT

DO NOT OWN FACILITIES OR TO COMPANIES NEEDING ADDITIONAL

CAPACITY. THESE FOUNDRIES AND SUBCONTRACTORS MAY ALSO OFFER

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, DESIGN SERVICES, AND OTHER GOODS AND

SERVICES TO OUR COMPETITORS. A DISADVANTAGE OF OUR APPROACH

COMPARED TO FABLESS SEMICONDUCTOR COMPANIES IS THAT IT IS MORE

DIFFICULT FOR US TO REDUCE OUR COSTS IN THE SHORT TERM. ALSO,

COMPETITORS WHO OUTSOURCE THEIR MANUFACTURING AND ASSEMBLY AND

TEST OPERATIONS CAN SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE THEIR CAPITAL

EXPENDITURES.

WE PLAN TO CONTINUE TO CULTIVATE

NEW BUSINESSES AND WORK WITH THE COMPUTING AND COMMUNICATIONS

INDUSTRIES THROUGH STANDARDS BODIES, TRADE ASSOCIATIONS, OEMS,

ODMS, AND INDEPENDENT SOFTWARE AND OPERATING SYSTEM VENDORS TO

HELP ALIGN THE INDUSTRY TO OFFER PRODUCTS THAT TAKE ADVANTAGE OF

THE LATEST MARKET TRENDS AND USAGE MODELS. WE FREQUENTLY

PARTICIPATE IN INDUSTRY INITIATIVES DESIGNED TO DISCUSS AND

AGREE UPON TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS AND OTHER ASPECTS OF

TECHNOLOGIES THAT COULD BE ADOPTED AS STANDARDS BY

STANDARDS-SETTING ORGANIZATIONS. OUR COMPETITORS MAY ALSO

PARTICIPATE IN THE SAME INITIATIVES AND SPECIFICATION

DEVELOPMENT. OUR PARTICIPATION DOES NOT ENSURE THAT ANY

STANDARDS OR SPECIFICATIONS ADOPTED BY THESE ORGANIZATIONS WILL

BE CONSISTENT WITH OUR PRODUCT PLANNING.

MICROPROCESSORS

WE CONTINUE TO BE LARGELY

DEPENDENT ON THE SUCCESS OF OUR MICROPROCESSOR BUSINESS. OUR

ABILITY TO COMPETE DEPENDS ON OUR ABILITY TO DELIVER NEW

MICROPROCESSOR PRODUCTS WITH IMPROVED OVERALL PERFORMANCE AND

IMPROVED ENERGY-EFFICIENT PERFORMANCE AT COMPETITIVE PRICES.

SOME OF OUR MICROPROCESSOR COMPETITORS, SUCH AS AMD, MARKET

SOFTWARE-COMPATIBLE PRODUCTS THAT COMPETE WITH OUR PROCESSORS.

WE ALSO FACE COMPETITION FROM COMPANIES OFFERING RIVAL

ARCHITECTURE DESIGNS, SUCH AS CELL BROADBAND ENGINE ARCHITECTURE

DEVELOPED JOINTLY BY INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS MACHINES CORPORATION

(IBM), SONY CORPORATION, AND TOSHIBA CORPORATION; POWER

ARCHITECTURE* OFFERED BY IBM; ARM ARCHITECTURE DEVELOPED BY ARM

LIMITED; AND SCALABLE PROCESSOR ARCHITECTURE (SPARC*) OFFERED BY

SUN MICROSYSTEMS, INC. NVIDIA HAS DEVELOPED A PROGRAMMING

INTERFACE TO ATTEMPT TO EXPAND THE USE OF ITS GRAPHICS

PROCESSORS TO ACCOMPLISH GENERAL-PURPOSE COMPUTING FUNCTIONS

TYPICALLY PERFORMED BY A MICROPROCESSOR IN HIGHLY PARALLEL

MICROPROCESSOR PRODUCTS. COMPETING CHIPSETS ARE PRODUCED BY

COMPANIES SUCH AS AMD (INCLUDING CHIPSETS MARKETED UNDER THE ATI

TECHNOLOGIES, INC. BRAND), NVIDIA, SILICON INTEGRATED SYSTEMS

CORPORATION, AND VIA.

WE ALSO COMPETE WITH COMPANIES

OFFERING GRAPHICS COMPONENTS AND OTHER SPECIAL-PURPOSE PRODUCTS

USED IN THE DESKTOP, MOBILE, AND ENTERPRISE MARKET SEGMENTS. ONE

ASPECT OF OUR BUSINESS MODEL IS TO INCORPORATE IMPROVED

PERFORMANCE AND ADVANCED PROPERTIES INTO OUR MICROPROCESSORS AND

CHIPSETS, FOR WHICH DEMAND MAY INCREASINGLY BE AFFECTED BY

COMPETITION FROM COMPANIES, SUCH AS NVIDIA AND AMD (INCLUDING

PRODUCTS MARKETED UNDER THE ATI TECHNOLOGIES, INC. BRAND), WHOSE

BUSINESS MODELS ARE BASED ON INCORPORATING IMPROVED PERFORMANCE

INTO DEDICATED CHIPSETS AND OTHER COMPONENTS, SUCH AS GRAPHICS

CONTROLLERS.

CLEARWIRE CORPORATION AND SPRINT NEXTEL CORPORATION COMBINED

THEIR RESPECTIVE WIMAX BUSINESSES IN CONJUNCTION WITH ADDITIONAL

CAPITAL CONTRIBUTIONS FROM INTEL AND OTHER INVESTORS TO FORM A

NEW COMPANY THAT RETAINED THE NAME CLEARWIRE CORPORATION. THE

ADDITIONAL CAPITAL CONTRIBUTIONS INCLUDED OUR CASH INVESTMENT OF

$1.0 BILLION. OUR PRE-EXISTING INVESTMENT IN CLEARWIRE

WE HAVE FILED AND OBTAINED A

NUMBER OF PATENTS IN THE U.S. AND OTHER COUNTRIES. WHILE OUR

PATENTS ARE AN IMPORTANT ELEMENT OF OUR SUCCESS, OUR BUSINESS AS

A WHOLE IS NOT SIGNIFICANTLY DEPENDENT ON ANY ONE PATENT. WE AND

OTHER COMPANIES IN THE COMPUTING, TELECOMMUNICATIONS, AND

RELATED HIGH-TECHNOLOGY FIELDS TYPICALLY APPLY FOR AND RECEIVE,

IN THE AGGREGATE, TENS OF THOUSANDS OF OVERLAPPING PATENTS

ANNUALLY IN THE U.S. AND OTHER COUNTRIES. WE BELIEVE THAT THE

DURATION OF THE APPLICABLE PATENTS THAT WE ARE GRANTED IS

ADEQUATE RELATIVE TO THE EXPECTED LIVES OF OUR PRODUCTS. BECAUSE

OF THE FAST PACE OF INNOVATION AND PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT, OUR

PRODUCTS ARE OFTEN OBSOLETE BEFORE THE PATENTS RELATED TO THEM

EXPIRE, AND SOMETIMES ARE OBSOLETE BEFORE THE PATENTS RELATED TO

THEM ARE EVEN GRANTED. AS WE EXPAND OUR PRODUCT OFFERINGS INTO

NEW INDUSTRIES, WE ALSO SEEK TO EXTEND OUR PATENT DEVELOPMENT

EFFORTS TO PATENT SUCH PRODUCT OFFERINGS. ESTABLISHED

COMPETITORS IN EXISTING AND NEW INDUSTRIES, AS WELL AS COMPANIES

THAT PURCHASE AND ENFORCE PATENTS AND OTHER INTELLECTUAL

PROPERTY, MAY ALREADY HAVE PATENTS COVERING SIMILAR PRODUCTS.

THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO OBTAIN PATENTS

COVERING OUR OWN PRODUCTS, OR THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO OBTAIN

LICENSES FROM SUCH COMPANIES ON FAVORABLE TERMS OR AT ALL.

THE MAJORITY OF THE SOFTWARE THAT

WE DISTRIBUTE, INCLUDING SOFTWARE EMBEDDED IN OUR COMPONENT- AND

SYSTEM-LEVEL PRODUCTS, IS ENTITLED TO COPYRIGHT PROTECTION. TO

DISTINGUISH INTEL PRODUCTS FROM OUR COMPETITORS PRODUCTS,

WE HAVE OBTAINED CERTAIN TRADEMARKS AND TRADE NAMES FOR OUR

PRODUCTS, AND WE MAINTAIN COOPERATIVE ADVERTISING PROGRAMS WITH

CERTAIN CUSTOMERS TO PROMOTE OUR BRANDS AND TO IDENTIFY PRODUCTS

CONTAINING GENUINE INTEL COMPONENTS. WE ALSO PROTECT CERTAIN

DETAILS ABOUT OUR PROCESSES, PRODUCTS, AND STRATEGIES AS TRADE

SECRETS, KEEPING CONFIDENTIAL THE INFORMATION THAT WE BELIEVE

PROVIDES US WITH A COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE. WE HAVE ONGOING

PROGRAMS DESIGNED TO MAINTAIN THE CONFIDENTIALITY OF SUCH

INFORMATION.

COMPLIANCE

WITH ENVIRONMENTAL, HEALTH, AND SAFETY REGULATIONS

OUR COMPLIANCE EFFORTS FOCUS ON

MONITORING REGULATORY AND RESOURCE TRENDS AND SETTING

COMPANY-WIDE PERFORMANCE TARGETS FOR KEY RESOURCES AND

EMISSIONS. THESE TARGETS ADDRESS SEVERAL PARAMETERS, INCLUDING

PRODUCT DESIGN; CHEMICAL, ENERGY, AND WATER USE; CLIMATE CHANGE;

WASTE RECYCLING; AND EMISSIONS.

INTEL FOCUSES ON REDUCING NATURAL

RESOURCE USE, THE SOLID AND CHEMICAL WASTE BY-PRODUCTS OF OUR

MANUFACTURING PROCESSES, AND THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT OF OUR

PRODUCTS. WE CURRENTLY USE A VARIETY OF MATERIALS IN OUR

MANUFACTURING PROCESS THAT HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO ADVERSELY

IMPACT THE ENVIRONMENT AND ARE SUBJECT TO A VARIETY OF EHS LAWS

AND REGULATIONS. FOR EXAMPLE, LEAD AND HALOGENATED MATERIALS

(SUCH AS CERTAIN FLAME RETARDANTS AND PLASTICS) HAVE BEEN USED

BY THE ELECTRONICS INDUSTRY FOR DECADES. FINDING SUITABLE

REPLACEMENTS HAS BEEN A TECHNICAL CHALLENGE FOR THE INDUSTRY,

AND WE HAVE WORKED FOR YEARS WITH OUR SUPPLIERS AND OTHERS IN

THE INDUSTRY TO DEVELOP LEAD-FREE AND HALOGEN-FREE SOLUTIONS.

WE WORK WITH THE U.S.

ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY (EPA), NON-GOVERNMENTAL

ORGANIZATIONS, OEMS, AND RETAILERS TO HELP MANAGE

E-WASTE

(WHICH INCLUDES ELECTRONIC PRODUCTS NEARING THE END OF THEIR

USEFUL LIVES) AND PROMOTE RECYCLING. THE EUROPEAN UNION REQUIRES

PRODUCERS OF CERTAIN ELECTRICAL AND ELECTRONIC EQUIPMENT TO

DEVELOP PROGRAMS THAT ALLOW CONSUMERS TO RETURN PRODUCTS FOR

RECYCLING. MANY STATES IN THE U.S. HAVE SIMILAR

E-WASTE

TAKE-BACK LAWS. THE INCONSISTENCY OF MANY

E-WASTE

TAKE-BACK LAWS AND THE LACK OF LOCAL

INTEL SEEKS TO REDUCE OUR GLOBAL

GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS BY INVESTING IN ENERGY CONSERVATION

PROJECTS IN OUR FACTORIES AND WORKING WITH SUPPLIERS TO IMPROVE

ENERGY EFFICIENCY. WE TAKE A HOLISTIC APPROACH TO POWER

MANAGEMENT, ADDRESSING THE CHALLENGE AT THE SILICON, PACKAGE,

CIRCUIT, MICRO/MACRO ARCHITECTURE, PLATFORM, AND SOFTWARE

LEVELS. WE RECOGNIZE THAT CLIMATE CHANGE MAY CAUSE GENERAL

ECONOMIC RISK. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON THE RISKS OF

CLIMATE CHANGE, SEE RISK FACTORS IN ITEM 1A OF

THIS

FORM 10-K.

WE ROUTINELY MONITOR ENERGY COSTS TO UNDERSTAND THE LONG-RANGE

IMPACTS THAT RISING COSTS MAY HAVE ON OUR BUSINESS. WE SEE THE

POTENTIAL FOR HIGHER ENERGY COSTS DRIVEN BY CLIMATE CHANGE

REGULATIONS. THIS COULD INCLUDE ITEMS APPLIED TO UTILITIES THAT

ARE PASSED ALONG TO CUSTOMERS, SUCH AS CARBON TAXES OR COSTS

ASSOCIATED WITH EMISSION CAP AND TRADE PROGRAMS OR RENEWABLE

PORTFOLIO STANDARDS. IN PARTICULAR, REGULATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH

THE WESTERN CLIMATE INITIATIVE COULD HAVE AN IMPACT ON OUR

COMPANY, BECAUSE A NUMBER OF OUR LARGE MANUFACTURING FACILITIES

ARE LOCATED IN THE WESTERN UNITED STATES. SIMILARLY, OUR

OPERATIONS IN IRELAND ARE ALREADY SUBJECT TO THE EUROPEAN

UNIONS MANDATORY CAP AND TRADE SCHEME FOR GLOBAL-WARMING

EMISSIONS. ALL OF OUR SITES ALSO MAY BE IMPACTED BY UTILITY

PROGRAMS DIRECTED BY LEGISLATION, REGULATORY, OR OTHER PRESSURES

THAT ARE TARGETED TO PASS COSTS THROUGH TO USERS.

WE MAINTAIN BUSINESS RECOVERY

PLANS THAT ARE INTENDED TO ENSURE OUR ABILITY TO RECOVER FROM

NATURAL DISASTERS OR OTHER EVENTS THAT CAN BE DISRUPTIVE TO OUR

BUSINESS. MANY OF OUR OPERATIONS ARE LOCATED IN SEMI-ARID

REGIONS, SUCH AS ISRAEL AND THE SOUTHWESTERN UNITED STATES. SOME

CLIMATE CHANGE SCENARIOS PREDICT THAT SUCH REGIONS CAN BECOME

EVEN MORE VULNERABLE TO PROLONGED DROUGHTS DUE TO CLIMATE

CHANGE. WE HAVE HAD AN AGGRESSIVE WATER CONSERVATION PROGRAM IN

PLACE FOR MANY YEARS. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR WATER CONSERVATION AND

RECOVERY PROGRAMS WILL HELP REDUCE OUR RISK IF WATER

AVAILABILITY BECOMES MORE CONSTRAINED IN THE FUTURE. WE FURTHER

MAINTAIN LONG-RANGE PLANS TO IDENTIFY POTENTIAL FUTURE WATER

CONSERVATION ACTIONS THAT WE CAN TAKE.

WE ARE COMMITTED TO SUSTAINABILITY

AND TAKE A LEADERSHIP POSITION IN PROMOTING VOLUNTARY

ENVIRONMENTAL INITIATIVES AND WORKING PROACTIVELY WITH

GOVERNMENTS, ENVIRONMENTAL GROUPS, AND INDUSTRY TO PROMOTE

GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY. WE BELIEVE THAT TECHNOLOGY

WILL BE FUNDAMENTAL TO FINDING SOLUTIONS TO THE WORLDS

ENVIRONMENTAL CHALLENGES, AND WE ARE JOINING FORCES WITH

INDUSTRY, BUSINESS, AND GOVERNMENTS TO FIND AND PROMOTE WAYS

THAT TECHNOLOGY CAN BE USED AS A TOOL TO COMBAT CLIMATE CHANGE.

FOR SEVERAL YEARS, WE HAVE BEEN

EVALUATING GREEN DESIGN STANDARDS AND INCORPORATING

GREEN BUILDING CONCEPTS AND PRACTICES INTO THE CONSTRUCTION OF

OUR BUILDINGS. WE ARE IN THE PROCESS OF OBTAINING LEADERSHIP IN

ENERGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL DESIGN (LEED) CERTIFICATION FOR AN

OFFICE BUILDING UNDER CONSTRUCTION IN ISRAEL AND A NEWLY

CONSTRUCTED FABRICATION BUILDING IN ARIZONA. WE HAVE BEEN

PURCHASING WIND POWER AND OTHER FORMS OF RENEWABLE ENERGY AT

SOME OF OUR MAJOR SITES FOR SEVERAL YEARS. AT THE BEGINNING OF

2008, WE ANNOUNCED PLANS TO PURCHASE RENEWABLE ENERGY

CERTIFICATES UNDER A MULTI-YEAR CONTRACT. THE PURCHASE PLACED

INTEL AT THE TOP OF THE EPAS GREEN POWER PARTNERSHIP FOR

2008. THE PURCHASE WAS INTENDED TO HELP STIMULATE THE MARKET FOR

GREEN POWER, LEADING TO ADDITIONAL GENERATING CAPACITY AND,

ULTIMATELY, LOWER COSTS.

ITEM 1A. RISK

FACTORS

FLUCTUATIONS

IN DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS MAY HARM OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS AND

ARE DIFFICULT TO FORECAST.

CURRENT UNCERTAINTY IN GLOBAL

ECONOMIC CONDITIONS POSES A RISK TO THE OVERALL ECONOMY, AS

CONSUMERS AND BUSINESSES HAVE DEFERRED AND MAY CONTINUE TO DEFER

PURCHASES IN RESPONSE TO TIGHTER CREDIT AND LESS DISCRETIONARY

SPENDING, WHICH NEGATIVELY AFFECT PRODUCT DEMAND AND OTHER

RELATED MATTERS. IF DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS FLUCTUATES AS A

RESULT OF ECONOMIC CONDITIONS OR FOR OTHER REASONS, OUR REVENUE

AND GROSS MARGIN COULD BE HARMED. IMPORTANT FACTORS THAT COULD

CAUSE DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS TO FLUCTUATE INCLUDE.



CHANGES IN BUSINESS AND ECONOMIC

CONDITIONS, INCLUDING A DOWNTURN IN THE SEMICONDUCTOR INDUSTRY

AND/OR

THE

OVERALL ECONOMY;



CHANGES IN CONSUMER CONFIDENCE

CAUSED BY CHANGES IN MARKET CONDITIONS, INCLUDING CHANGES IN THE

CREDIT MARKET, EXPECTATIONS FOR INFLATION, AND ENERGY PRICES;



CHANGES IN THE LEVEL OF

CUSTOMERS COMPONENTS INVENTORY;



COMPETITIVE PRESSURES, INCLUDING

PRICING PRESSURES, FROM COMPANIES THAT HAVE COMPETING PRODUCTS,

CHIP ARCHITECTURES, MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGIES, AND MARKETING

PROGRAMS;



CHANGES IN CUSTOMER PRODUCT NEEDS;



STRATEGIC ACTIONS TAKEN BY OUR

COMPETITORS; AND



MARKET ACCEPTANCE OF OUR PRODUCTS.

IF PRODUCT DEMAND DECREASES, OUR

MANUFACTURING OR ASSEMBLY AND TEST CAPACITY COULD BE

UNDER-UTILIZED, AND WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO RECORD AN IMPAIRMENT

ON OUR LONG-LIVED ASSETS, INCLUDING FACILITIES AND EQUIPMENT, AS

WELL AS INTANGIBLE ASSETS, WHICH WOULD INCREASE OUR EXPENSES. IN

ADDITION, IF PRODUCT DEMAND DECREASES OR WE FAIL TO FORECAST

DEMAND ACCURATELY, WE COULD BE REQUIRED TO WRITE OFF INVENTORY

OR RECORD UNDER-UTILIZATION CHARGES, WHICH WOULD HAVE A NEGATIVE

IMPACT ON OUR GROSS MARGIN. FACTORY-PLANNING DECISIONS MAY

SHORTEN THE USEFUL LIVES OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS, INCLUDING

FACILITIES AND EQUIPMENT, AND CAUSE US TO ACCELERATE

DEPRECIATION. IN THE LONG TERM, IF PRODUCT DEMAND INCREASES, WE

MAY NOT BE ABLE TO ADD MANUFACTURING OR ASSEMBLY AND TEST

CAPACITY FAST ENOUGH TO MEET MARKET DEMAND. THESE CHANGES IN

DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS, AND CHANGES IN OUR CUSTOMERS

PRODUCT NEEDS, COULD HAVE A VARIETY OF NEGATIVE EFFECTS ON OUR

COMPETITIVE POSITION AND OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS, AND, IN CERTAIN

CASES, MAY REDUCE OUR REVENUE, INCREASE OUR COSTS, LOWER OUR

GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE, OR REQUIRE US TO RECOGNIZE IMPAIRMENTS

OF OUR ASSETS.

THE

RECENT FINANCIAL CRISIS COULD NEGATIVELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS,

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

THE RECENT FINANCIAL CRISIS

AFFECTING THE BANKING SYSTEM AND FINANCIAL MARKETS AND THE GOING

CONCERN THREATS TO FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS HAVE RESULTED IN A

TIGHTENING IN THE CREDIT MARKETS; A LOW LEVEL OF LIQUIDITY IN

MANY FINANCIAL MARKETS; AND EXTREME VOLATILITY IN CREDIT, FIXED

INCOME, AND EQUITY MARKETS. THERE COULD BE A NUMBER OF FOLLOW-ON

EFFECTS FROM THE CREDIT CRISIS ON INTELS BUSINESS,

INCLUDING INSOLVENCY OF KEY SUPPLIERS, RESULTING IN PRODUCT

DELAYS; INABILITY OF CUSTOMERS TO OBTAIN CREDIT TO FINANCE

PURCHASES OF OUR PRODUCTS

AND/OR

CUSTOMER INSOLVENCIES; COUNTERPARTY FAILURES NEGATIVELY

IMPACTING OUR TREASURY OPERATIONS; INCREASED EXPENSE OR

INABILITY TO OBTAIN SHORT-TERM FINANCING OF INTELS

OPERATIONS FROM THE ISSUANCE OF COMMERCIAL PAPER; AND INCREASED

IMPAIRMENT CHARGES DUE TO DECLINES IN THE FAIR VALUES OF

MARKETABLE DEBT OR EQUITY INVESTMENTS. THE CURRENT VOLATILITY IN

THE FINANCIAL MARKETS AND OVERALL ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTY INCREASE

THE RISK THAT THE ACTUAL AMOUNTS REALIZED IN THE FUTURE ON OUR

DEBT AND EQUITY INVESTMENTS WILL DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE

FAIR VALUES CURRENTLY ASSIGNED TO THEM.

THE

SEMICONDUCTOR INDUSTRY AND OUR OPERATIONS ARE CHARACTERIZED BY A

HIGH PERCENTAGE OF COSTS THAT ARE FIXED OR DIFFICULT TO REDUCE

IN THE SHORT TERM, AND BY PRODUCT DEMAND THAT IS HIGHLY VARIABLE

AND SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT DOWNTURNS THAT MAY HARM OUR BUSINESS,

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

THE SEMICONDUCTOR INDUSTRY AND OUR

OPERATIONS ARE CHARACTERIZED BY HIGH COSTS, SUCH AS THOSE

RELATED TO FACILITY CONSTRUCTION AND EQUIPMENT, R&D, AND

EMPLOYMENT AND TRAINING OF A HIGHLY SKILLED WORKFORCE, THAT ARE

EITHER FIXED OR DIFFICULT TO REDUCE IN THE SHORT TERM. AT THE

SAME TIME, DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS IS HIGHLY VARIABLE AND THERE

HAVE BEEN DOWNTURNS, OFTEN IN CONNECTION WITH MATURING PRODUCT

CYCLES AS WELL AS DOWNTURNS IN GENERAL ECONOMIC MARKET

CONDITIONS, SUCH AS THE CURRENT ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT. THESE

DOWNTURNS HAVE BEEN CHARACTERIZED BY REDUCED PRODUCT DEMAND,

MANUFACTURING OVERCAPACITY AND RESULTING EXCESS CAPACITY

CHARGES, HIGH INVENTORY LEVELS, AND LOWER AVERAGE SELLING

PRICES. THE COMBINATION OF THESE FACTORS MAY CAUSE OUR REVENUE,

GROSS MARGIN, CASH FLOW, AND PROFITABILITY TO VARY SIGNIFICANTLY

IN BOTH THE SHORT AND LONG TERM.

16

TABLE OF CONTENTS

WE

OPERATE IN INTENSELY COMPETITIVE INDUSTRIES, AND OUR FAILURE TO

RESPOND QUICKLY TO TECHNOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENTS AND INCORPORATE

NEW FEATURES INTO OUR PRODUCTS COULD HARM OUR ABILITY TO

COMPETE.

WE OPERATE IN INTENSELY

COMPETITIVE INDUSTRIES THAT EXPERIENCE RAPID TECHNOLOGICAL

DEVELOPMENTS, CHANGES IN INDUSTRY STANDARDS, CHANGES IN CUSTOMER

REQUIREMENTS, AND FREQUENT NEW PRODUCT INTRODUCTIONS AND

IMPROVEMENTS. IF WE ARE UNABLE TO RESPOND QUICKLY AND

SUCCESSFULLY TO THESE DEVELOPMENTS, WE MAY LOSE OUR COMPETITIVE

POSITION, AND OUR PRODUCTS OR TECHNOLOGIES MAY BECOME

UNCOMPETITIVE OR OBSOLETE. TO COMPETE SUCCESSFULLY, WE MUST

MAINTAIN A SUCCESSFUL R&D EFFORT, DEVELOP NEW PRODUCTS AND

PRODUCTION PROCESSES, AND IMPROVE OUR EXISTING PRODUCTS AND

PROCESSES AT THE SAME PACE OR AHEAD OF OUR COMPETITORS. WE MAY

NOT BE ABLE TO DEVELOP AND MARKET THESE NEW PRODUCTS

SUCCESSFULLY, THE PRODUCTS WE INVEST IN AND DEVELOP MAY NOT BE

WELL RECEIVED BY CUSTOMERS, AND PRODUCTS DEVELOPED AND NEW

TECHNOLOGIES OFFERED BY OTHERS MAY AFFECT DEMAND FOR OUR

PRODUCTS. THESE TYPES OF EVENTS COULD HAVE A VARIETY OF NEGATIVE

EFFECTS ON OUR COMPETITIVE POSITION AND OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS,

SUCH AS REDUCING OUR REVENUE, INCREASING OUR COSTS, LOWERING OUR

GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE, AND REQUIRING US TO RECOGNIZE

IMPAIRMENTS ON OUR ASSETS.

WE MAY

BE SUBJECT TO LITIGATION PROCEEDINGS THAT COULD HARM OUR

BUSINESS.

WE MAY BE SUBJECT TO LEGAL CLAIMS

OR REGULATORY MATTERS INVOLVING STOCKHOLDER, CONSUMER,

COMPETITION, AND OTHER ISSUES ON A GLOBAL BASIS. AS DESCRIBED IN

NOTE 24: CONTINGENCIES IN PART II,

ITEM 8 OF THIS

FORM 10-K,

WE ARE CURRENTLY ENGAGED IN A NUMBER OF LITIGATION MATTERS,

PARTICULARLY WITH RESPECT TO COMPETITION. LITIGATION IS SUBJECT

TO INHERENT UNCERTAINTIES, AND UNFAVORABLE RULINGS COULD OCCUR.

AN UNFAVORABLE RULING COULD INCLUDE MONETARY DAMAGES OR, IN

CASES FOR WHICH INJUNCTIVE RELIEF IS SOUGHT, AN INJUNCTION

PROHIBITING US FROM MANUFACTURING OR SELLING ONE OR MORE

PRODUCTS. IF WE WERE TO RECEIVE AN UNFAVORABLE RULING IN A

MATTER, OUR BUSINESS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COULD BE

MATERIALLY HARMED.

WE

INVEST IN COMPANIES FOR STRATEGIC REASONS AND MAY NOT REALIZE A

RETURN ON OUR INVESTMENTS.

WE MAKE INVESTMENTS IN COMPANIES

AROUND THE WORLD TO FURTHER OUR STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES AND SUPPORT

OUR KEY BUSINESS INITIATIVES. SUCH INVESTMENTS INCLUDE EQUITY OR

DEBT INSTRUMENTS OF PUBLIC OR PRIVATE COMPANIES, AND MANY OF

THESE INSTRUMENTS ARE NON-MARKETABLE AT THE TIME OF OUR INITIAL

INVESTMENT. THESE COMPANIES RANGE FROM EARLY-STAGE COMPANIES

THAT ARE OFTEN STILL DEFINING THEIR STRATEGIC DIRECTION TO MORE

MATURE COMPANIES WITH ESTABLISHED REVENUE STREAMS AND BUSINESS

MODELS. THE SUCCESS OF THESE COMPANIES IS DEPENDENT ON PRODUCT

DEVELOPMENT, MARKET ACCEPTANCE, OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCY, AND

OTHER KEY BUSINESS FACTORS. THE COMPANIES IN WHICH WE INVEST MAY

FAIL BECAUSE THEY MAY NOT BE ABLE TO SECURE ADDITIONAL FUNDING,

OBTAIN FAVORABLE INVESTMENT TERMS FOR FUTURE FINANCINGS, OR TAKE

ADVANTAGE OF LIQUIDITY EVENTS SUCH AS PUBLIC OFFERINGS, MERGERS,

AND PRIVATE SALES. THE CURRENT ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT MAY INCREASE

THE RISK OF FAILURE FOR MANY OF THE COMPANIES IN WHICH WE INVEST

DUE TO LIMITED ACCESS TO CREDIT AND REDUCED FREQUENCY OF

LIQUIDITY EVENTS. IF ANY OF THESE PRIVATE COMPANIES FAIL, WE

COULD LOSE ALL OR PART OF OUR INVESTMENT IN THAT COMPANY. IF WE

DETERMINE THAT AN OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY DECLINE IN THE FAIR VALUE

EXISTS FOR AN EQUITY INVESTMENT IN A PUBLIC OR PRIVATE COMPANY

IN WHICH WE HAVE INVESTED, WE WRITE DOWN THE INVESTMENT TO ITS

FAIR VALUE AND RECOGNIZE THE RELATED WRITE-DOWN AS AN INVESTMENT

LOSS. THE MAJORITY OF OUR NON-MARKETABLE EQUITY INVESTMENT

PORTFOLIO BALANCE IS CONCENTRATED IN COMPANIES IN THE FLASH

MEMORY MARKET SEGMENT AND WIRELESS CONNECTIVITY MARKET SEGMENT,

AND DECLINES IN THESE MARKET SEGMENTS OR CHANGES IN

MANAGEMENTS PLANS WITH RESPECT TO OUR INVESTMENTS IN THESE

MARKET SEGMENTS COULD RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT IMPAIRMENT CHARGES,

IMPACTING GAINS/LOSSES ON EQUITY METHOD INVESTMENTS AND

GAINS/LOSSES ON OTHER EQUITY INVESTMENTS.

FURTHERMORE, WHEN THE STRATEGIC

OBJECTIVES OF AN INVESTMENT HAVE BEEN ACHIEVED, OR IF THE

INVESTMENT OR BUSINESS DIVERGES FROM OUR STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES,

WE MAY DECIDE TO DISPOSE OF THE INVESTMENT. OUR NON-MARKETABLE

EQUITY INVESTMENTS IN PRIVATE COMPANIES ARE NOT LIQUID, AND WE

MAY NOT BE ABLE TO DISPOSE OF THESE INVESTMENTS ON FAVORABLE

TERMS OR AT ALL. THE OCCURRENCE OF ANY OF THESE EVENTS COULD

HARM OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. ADDITIONALLY, FOR CASES IN WHICH

WE ARE REQUIRED UNDER EQUITY METHOD ACCOUNTING TO RECOGNIZE A

PROPORTIONATE SHARE OF ANOTHER COMPANYS INCOME OR LOSS,

SUCH INCOME AND LOSS MAY IMPACT OUR EARNINGS. GAINS OR LOSSES

FROM EQUITY SECURITIES COULD VARY FROM EXPECTATIONS DEPENDING ON

GAINS OR LOSSES REALIZED ON THE SALE OR EXCHANGE OF SECURITIES,

GAINS OR LOSSES FROM EQUITY METHOD INVESTMENTS, AND IMPAIRMENT

CHARGES RELATED TO DEBT INSTRUMENTS AS WELL AS EQUITY AND OTHER

INVESTMENTS.

OUR

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COULD VARY AS A RESULT OF THE METHODS,

ESTIMATES, AND JUDGMENTS THAT WE USE IN APPLYING OUR ACCOUNTING

POLICIES.

THE METHODS, ESTIMATES, AND

JUDGMENTS THAT WE USE IN APPLYING OUR ACCOUNTING POLICIES HAVE A

SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (SEE

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES IN PART II,

ITEM 7 OF THIS

FORM 10-K).

SUCH METHODS, ESTIMATES, AND JUDGMENTS ARE, BY THEIR NATURE,

SUBJECT TO SUBSTANTIAL RISKS, UNCERTAINTIES, AND ASSUMPTIONS,

AND FACTORS MAY ARISE OVER TIME THAT LEAD US TO CHANGE OUR

METHODS, ESTIMATES, AND JUDGMENTS. CHANGES IN THOSE METHODS,

ESTIMATES, AND JUDGMENTS COULD SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT OUR RESULTS

OF OPERATIONS. THE CURRENT VOLATILITY IN THE FINANCIAL MARKETS

AND OVERALL ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTY INCREASE THE RISK THAT THE

ACTUAL AMOUNTS REALIZED IN THE FUTURE ON OUR DEBT AND EQUITY

INVESTMENTS WILL DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE FAIR VALUES

CURRENTLY ASSIGNED TO THEM.

17

TABLE OF CONTENTS

FLUCTUATIONS

IN THE MIX OF PRODUCTS SOLD MAY HARM OUR FINANCIAL

RESULTS.

BECAUSE OF THE WIDE PRICE

DIFFERENCES AMONG AND WITHIN MOBILE, DESKTOP, AND SERVER

MICROPROCESSORS, THE MIX AND TYPES OF PERFORMANCE CAPABILITIES

OF MICROPROCESSORS SOLD AFFECT THE AVERAGE SELLING PRICE OF OUR

PRODUCTS AND HAVE A SUBSTANTIAL IMPACT ON OUR REVENUE AND GROSS

MARGIN. OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS ALSO DEPEND IN PART ON THE MIX OF

OTHER PRODUCTS THAT WE SELL, SUCH AS CHIPSETS, FLASH MEMORY, AND

OTHER SEMICONDUCTOR PRODUCTS. IN ADDITION, MORE RECENTLY

INTRODUCED PRODUCTS TEND TO HAVE HIGHER ASSOCIATED COSTS BECAUSE

OF INITIAL OVERALL DEVELOPMENT AND PRODUCTION RAMP. FLUCTUATIONS

IN THE MIX AND TYPES OF OUR PRODUCTS MAY ALSO AFFECT THE EXTENT

TO WHICH WE ARE ABLE TO RECOVER THE FIXED COSTS AND INVESTMENTS

ASSOCIATED WITH A PARTICULAR PRODUCT, AND AS A RESULT CAN HARM

OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS.

OUR

GLOBAL OPERATIONS SUBJECT US TO RISKS THAT MAY HARM OUR RESULTS

OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

WE HAVE SALES OFFICES, R&D,

MANUFACTURING, AND ASSEMBLY AND TEST FACILITIES IN MANY

COUNTRIES, AND AS A RESULT, WE ARE SUBJECT TO RISKS ASSOCIATED

WITH DOING BUSINESS GLOBALLY. OUR GLOBAL OPERATIONS MAY BE

SUBJECT TO RISKS THAT MAY LIMIT OUR ABILITY TO MANUFACTURE,

ASSEMBLE AND TEST, DESIGN, DEVELOP, OR SELL PRODUCTS IN

PARTICULAR COUNTRIES, WHICH COULD, IN TURN, HARM OUR RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION, INCLUDING.



SECURITY CONCERNS, SUCH AS ARMED

CONFLICT AND CIVIL OR MILITARY UNREST, CRIME, POLITICAL

INSTABILITY, AND TERRORIST ACTIVITY;



HEALTH CONCERNS;



NATURAL DISASTERS;



INEFFICIENT AND LIMITED

INFRASTRUCTURE AND DISRUPTIONS, SUCH AS LARGE-SCALE OUTAGES OR

INTERRUPTIONS OF SERVICE FROM UTILITIES OR TELECOMMUNICATIONS

PROVIDERS AND SUPPLY CHAIN INTERRUPTIONS;



DIFFERING EMPLOYMENT PRACTICES AND

LABOR ISSUES;



LOCAL BUSINESS AND CULTURAL

FACTORS THAT DIFFER FROM OUR NORMAL STANDARDS AND PRACTICES;



REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS AND

PROHIBITIONS THAT DIFFER BETWEEN JURISDICTIONS; AND



RESTRICTIONS ON OUR OPERATIONS BY

GOVERNMENTS SEEKING TO SUPPORT LOCAL INDUSTRIES, NATIONALIZATION

OF OUR OPERATIONS, AND RESTRICTIONS ON OUR ABILITY TO REPATRIATE

EARNINGS.

IN ADDITION, ALTHOUGH MOST OF OUR

PRODUCTS ARE SOLD IN U.S. DOLLARS, WE INCUR A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT

OF CERTAIN TYPES OF EXPENSES, SUCH AS PAYROLL, UTILITIES, TAX,

AND MARKETING EXPENSES, AS WELL AS CERTAIN INVESTING AND

FINANCING ACTIVITIES, IN LOCAL CURRENCIES. OUR HEDGING PROGRAMS

REDUCE, BUT DO NOT ENTIRELY ELIMINATE, THE IMPACT OF CURRENCY

EXCHANGE RATE MOVEMENTS, AND THEREFORE FLUCTUATIONS IN EXCHANGE

RATES COULD HARM OUR BUSINESS OPERATING RESULTS AND FINANCIAL

CONDITION. IN ADDITION, CHANGES IN TARIFF AND IMPORT REGULATIONS

AND IN U.S. AND

NON-U.S.

MONETARY POLICIES MAY HARM OUR OPERATING RESULTS AND FINANCIAL

CONDITION BY INCREASING OUR EXPENSES AND REDUCING OUR REVENUE.

VARYING TAX RATES IN DIFFERENT JURISDICTIONS COULD HARM OUR

OPERATING RESULTS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION BY INCREASING OUR

OVERALL TAX RATE.

WE MAINTAIN A PROGRAM OF INSURANCE

COVERAGE FOR VARIOUS TYPES OF PROPERTY, CASUALTY, AND OTHER

RISKS. WE PLACE OUR INSURANCE COVERAGE WITH VARIOUS CARRIERS IN

NUMEROUS JURISDICTIONS. THE TYPES AND AMOUNTS OF INSURANCE THAT

WE OBTAIN VARY FROM TIME TO TIME AND FROM LOCATION TO LOCATION,

DEPENDING ON AVAILABILITY, COST, AND OUR DECISIONS WITH RESPECT

TO RISK RETENTION. THE POLICIES ARE SUBJECT TO DEDUCTIBLES AND

EXCLUSIONS THAT RESULT IN OUR RETENTION OF A LEVEL OF RISK ON A

SELF-INSURANCE BASIS. LOSSES NOT COVERED BY INSURANCE MAY BE

SUBSTANTIAL AND MAY INCREASE OUR EXPENSES, WHICH COULD HARM OUR

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. IN ADDITION, THE

RECENT FINANCIAL CRISIS COULD POSE SOLVENCY RISKS FOR OUR

INSURERS, WHICH COULD REDUCE OUR COVERAGE IF ONE OR MORE OF OUR

INSURANCE PROVIDERS IS UNABLE TO PAY A CLAIM.

FAILURE

TO MEET OUR PRODUCTION TARGETS, RESULTING IN UNDERSUPPLY OR

OVERSUPPLY OF PRODUCTS, MAY HARM OUR BUSINESS AND RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS.

PRODUCTION OF INTEGRATED CIRCUITS

IS A COMPLEX PROCESS. DISRUPTIONS IN THIS PROCESS CAN RESULT

FROM INTERRUPTIONS IN OUR PROCESSES, ERRORS, AND DIFFICULTIES IN

OUR DEVELOPMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION OF NEW PROCESSES; DEFECTS IN

MATERIALS; DISRUPTIONS IN OUR SUPPLY OF MATERIALS OR RESOURCES;

AND DISRUPTIONS AT OUR FABRICATION AND ASSEMBLY AND TEST

FACILITIES DUE TO, FOR EXAMPLE, ACCIDENTS, MAINTENANCE ISSUES,

OR UNSAFE WORKING CONDITIONSALL OF WHICH COULD AFFECT THE

TIMING OF PRODUCTION RAMPS AND YIELDS. WE MAY NOT BE SUCCESSFUL

OR EFFICIENT IN DEVELOPING OR IMPLEMENTING NEW PRODUCTION

PROCESSES. THE OCCURRENCE OF ANY OF THE FOREGOING MAY RESULT IN

OUR FAILURE TO MEET OR INCREASE PRODUCTION AS DESIRED, RESULTING

IN HIGHER COSTS OR SUBSTANTIAL DECREASES IN YIELDS, WHICH COULD

AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO PRODUCE SUFFICIENT VOLUME TO MEET SPECIFIC

PRODUCT DEMAND. THE UNAVAILABILITY OR REDUCED AVAILABILITY OF

CERTAIN PRODUCTS COULD MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT TO IMPLEMENT OUR

PLATFORM STRATEGY. WE MAY ALSO EXPERIENCE INCREASES IN YIELDS. A

SUBSTANTIAL INCREASE IN YIELDS COULD RESULT IN HIGHER INVENTORY

LEVELS AND THE POSSIBILITY OF RESULTING EXCESS CAPACITY CHARGES

AS WE SLOW PRODUCTION TO REDUCE INVENTORY LEVELS. THE OCCURRENCE

OF ANY OF THESE EVENTS COULD HARM OUR BUSINESS AND RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS.

18

TABLE OF CONTENTS

WE MAY

HAVE DIFFICULTIES OBTAINING THE RESOURCES OR PRODUCTS WE NEED

FOR MANUFACTURING, ASSEMBLING AND TESTING OUR PRODUCTS, OR

OPERATING OTHER ASPECTS OF OUR BUSINESS, WHICH COULD HARM OUR

ABILITY TO MEET DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS AND MAY INCREASE OUR

COSTS.

WE HAVE THOUSANDS OF SUPPLIERS

PROVIDING VARIOUS MATERIALS THAT WE USE IN THE PRODUCTION OF OUR

PRODUCTS AND OTHER ASPECTS OF OUR BUSINESS, AND WE SEEK, WHERE

POSSIBLE, TO HAVE SEVERAL SOURCES OF SUPPLY FOR ALL OF THOSE

MATERIALS. HOWEVER, WE MAY RELY ON A SINGLE OR A LIMITED NUMBER

OF SUPPLIERS, OR UPON SUPPLIERS IN A SINGLE COUNTRY, FOR THESE

MATERIALS. THE INABILITY OF SUCH SUPPLIERS TO DELIVER ADEQUATE

SUPPLIES OF PRODUCTION MATERIALS OR OTHER SUPPLIES COULD DISRUPT

OUR PRODUCTION PROCESSES OR COULD MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR US

TO IMPLEMENT OUR BUSINESS STRATEGY. IN ADDITION, PRODUCTION

COULD BE DISRUPTED BY THE UNAVAILABILITY OF THE RESOURCES USED

IN PRODUCTION, SUCH AS WATER, SILICON, ELECTRICITY, AND GASES.

THE UNAVAILABILITY OR REDUCED AVAILABILITY OF THE MATERIALS OR

RESOURCES THAT WE USE IN OUR BUSINESS MAY REQUIRE US TO REDUCE

PRODUCTION OF PRODUCTS OR MAY REQUIRE US TO INCUR ADDITIONAL

COSTS IN ORDER TO OBTAIN AN ADEQUATE SUPPLY OF THOSE MATERIALS

OR RESOURCES. THE OCCURRENCE OF ANY OF THESE EVENTS COULD HARM

OUR BUSINESS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

COSTS

RELATED TO PRODUCT DEFECTS AND ERRATA MAY HARM OUR RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS AND BUSINESS.

COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH UNEXPECTED

PRODUCT DEFECTS AND ERRATA (DEVIATIONS FROM PUBLISHED

SPECIFICATIONS) DUE TO, FOR EXAMPLE, UNANTICIPATED PROBLEMS IN

OUR MANUFACTURING PROCESSES, INCLUDE.



WRITING OFF THE VALUE OF INVENTORY

OF DEFECTIVE PRODUCTS;



DISPOSING OF DEFECTIVE PRODUCTS

THAT CANNOT BE FIXED;



RECALLING DEFECTIVE PRODUCTS THAT

HAVE BEEN SHIPPED TO CUSTOMERS;



PROVIDING PRODUCT REPLACEMENTS

FOR, OR MODIFICATIONS TO, DEFECTIVE PRODUCTS; AND/OR



DEFENDING AGAINST LITIGATION

RELATED TO DEFECTIVE PRODUCTS.

THESE COSTS COULD BE SUBSTANTIAL

AND MAY THEREFORE INCREASE OUR EXPENSES AND LOWER OUR GROSS

MARGIN. IN ADDITION, OUR REPUTATION WITH OUR CUSTOMERS OR USERS

OF OUR PRODUCTS COULD BE DAMAGED AS A RESULT OF SUCH PRODUCT

DEFECTS AND ERRATA, AND THE DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS COULD BE

REDUCED. THESE FACTORS COULD HARM OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS AND THE

PROSPECTS FOR OUR BUSINESS.

WE MAY

BE SUBJECT TO CLAIMS OF INFRINGEMENT OF THIRD-PARTY INTELLECTUAL

PROPERTY RIGHTS, WHICH COULD HARM OUR BUSINESS.

FROM TIME TO TIME, THIRD PARTIES

MAY ASSERT AGAINST US OR OUR CUSTOMERS ALLEGED PATENT,

COPYRIGHT, TRADEMARK, OR OTHER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS TO

TECHNOLOGIES THAT ARE IMPORTANT TO OUR BUSINESS. AS DESCRIBED IN

NOTE 24: CONTINGENCIES IN PART II,

ITEM 8 OF THIS

FORM 10-K,

WE ARE CURRENTLY ENGAGED IN A NUMBER OF LITIGATION MATTERS

INVOLVING INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS. WE MAY BE SUBJECT TO

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY INFRINGEMENT CLAIMS FROM CERTAIN

INDIVIDUALS AND COMPANIES WHO HAVE ACQUIRED PATENT PORTFOLIOS

FOR THE SOLE PURPOSE OF ASSERTING SUCH CLAIMS AGAINST OTHER

COMPANIES. ANY CLAIMS THAT OUR PRODUCTS OR PROCESSES INFRINGE

THE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS OF OTHERS, REGARDLESS OF THE

MERIT OR RESOLUTION OF SUCH CLAIMS, COULD CAUSE US TO INCUR

SIGNIFICANT COSTS IN RESPONDING TO, DEFENDING, AND RESOLVING

SUCH CLAIMS, AND MAY DIVERT THE EFFORTS AND ATTENTION OF OUR

MANAGEMENT AND TECHNICAL PERSONNEL FROM OUR BUSINESS. AS A

RESULT OF SUCH INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY INFRINGEMENT CLAIMS, WE

COULD BE REQUIRED OR OTHERWISE DECIDE THAT IT IS APPROPRIATE TO.



PAY THIRD-PARTY INFRINGEMENT

CLAIMS;



DISCONTINUE MANUFACTURING, USING,

OR SELLING PARTICULAR PRODUCTS SUBJECT TO INFRINGEMENT CLAIMS;



DISCONTINUE USING THE TECHNOLOGY

OR PROCESSES SUBJECT TO INFRINGEMENT CLAIMS;



DEVELOP OTHER TECHNOLOGY NOT

SUBJECT TO INFRINGEMENT CLAIMS, WHICH COULD BE TIME-CONSUMING

AND COSTLY OR MAY NOT BE POSSIBLE; AND/OR



LICENSE TECHNOLOGY FROM THE THIRD

PARTY CLAIMING INFRINGEMENT, WHICH LICENSE MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE

ON COMMERCIALLY REASONABLE TERMS.

THE OCCURRENCE OF ANY OF THE

FOREGOING COULD RESULT IN UNEXPECTED EXPENSES OR REQUIRE US TO

RECOGNIZE AN IMPAIRMENT OF OUR ASSETS, WHICH WOULD REDUCE THE

VALUE OF OUR ASSETS AND INCREASE EXPENSES. IN ADDITION, IF WE

ALTER OR DISCONTINUE OUR PRODUCTION OF AFFECTED ITEMS, OUR

REVENUE COULD BE HARMED.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

WE MAY

NOT BE ABLE TO ENFORCE OR PROTECT OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

RIGHTS, WHICH MAY HARM OUR ABILITY TO COMPETE AND HARM OUR

BUSINESS.

OUR ABILITY TO ENFORCE OUR

PATENTS, COPYRIGHTS, SOFTWARE LICENSES, AND OTHER INTELLECTUAL

PROPERTY RIGHTS IS SUBJECT TO GENERAL LITIGATION RISKS, AS WELL

AS UNCERTAINTY AS TO THE ENFORCEABILITY OF OUR INTELLECTUAL

PROPERTY RIGHTS IN VARIOUS COUNTRIES. WHEN WE SEEK TO ENFORCE

OUR RIGHTS, WE ARE OFTEN SUBJECT TO CLAIMS THAT THE INTELLECTUAL

PROPERTY RIGHT IS INVALID, IS OTHERWISE NOT ENFORCEABLE, OR IS

LICENSED TO THE PARTY AGAINST WHOM WE ARE ASSERTING A CLAIM. IN

ADDITION, OUR ASSERTION OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS OFTEN

RESULTS IN THE OTHER PARTY SEEKING TO ASSERT ALLEGED

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS OF ITS OWN AGAINST US. IF WE ARE

NOT ULTIMATELY SUCCESSFUL IN DEFENDING OURSELVES AGAINST THESE

CLAIMS IN LITIGATION, WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO SELL A PARTICULAR

PRODUCT OR FAMILY OF PRODUCTS DUE TO AN INJUNCTION, OR WE MAY

HAVE TO PAY DAMAGES THAT COULD, IN TURN, HARM OUR RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS. IN ADDITION, GOVERNMENTS MAY ADOPT REGULATIONS OR

COURTS MAY RENDER DECISIONS REQUIRING COMPULSORY LICENSING OF

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY TO OTHERS, OR GOVERNMENTS MAY REQUIRE THAT

PRODUCTS MEET SPECIFIED STANDARDS THAT SERVE TO FAVOR LOCAL

COMPANIES. OUR INABILITY TO ENFORCE OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

RIGHTS UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES MAY HARM OUR COMPETITIVE

POSITION AND OUR BUSINESS.

OUR

LICENSES WITH OTHER COMPANIES AND OUR PARTICIPATION IN INDUSTRY

INITIATIVES MAY ALLOW OTHER COMPANIES, INCLUDING OUR

COMPETITORS, TO USE OUR PATENT RIGHTS.

COMPANIES IN THE SEMICONDUCTOR

INDUSTRY OFTEN RELY ON THE ABILITY TO LICENSE PATENTS FROM EACH

OTHER IN ORDER TO COMPETE. MANY OF OUR COMPETITORS HAVE BROAD

LICENSES OR CROSS-LICENSES WITH US, AND UNDER CURRENT CASE LAW,

SOME OF THESE LICENSES MAY PERMIT THESE COMPETITORS TO PASS OUR

PATENT RIGHTS ON TO OTHERS. IF ONE OF THESE LICENSEES BECOMES A

FOUNDRY, OUR COMPETITORS MIGHT BE ABLE TO AVOID OUR PATENT

RIGHTS IN MANUFACTURING COMPETING PRODUCTS. IN ADDITION, OUR

PARTICIPATION IN INDUSTRY INITIATIVES MAY REQUIRE US TO LICENSE

OUR PATENTS TO OTHER COMPANIES THAT ADOPT CERTAIN INDUSTRY

STANDARDS OR SPECIFICATIONS, EVEN WHEN SUCH ORGANIZATIONS DO NOT

ADOPT STANDARDS OR SPECIFICATIONS PROPOSED BY US. AS A RESULT,

OUR PATENTS IMPLICATED BY OUR PARTICIPATION IN INDUSTRY

INITIATIVES MIGHT NOT BE AVAILABLE FOR US TO ENFORCE AGAINST

OTHERS WHO MIGHT OTHERWISE BE DEEMED TO BE INFRINGING THOSE

PATENTS, OUR COSTS OF ENFORCING OUR LICENSES OR PROTECTING OUR

PATENTS MAY INCREASE, AND THE VALUE OF OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

MAY BE IMPAIRED.

CHANGES

IN OUR DECISIONS WITH REGARD TO RESTRUCTURING AND EFFICIENCY

EFFORTS, AND OTHER FACTORS, COULD AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

FACTORS THAT COULD CAUSE ACTUAL

RESULTS TO DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM OUR EXPECTATIONS WITH REGARD

TO RESTRUCTURING ACTIONS INCLUDE.



TIMING AND EXECUTION OF PLANS AND

PROGRAMS THAT MAY BE SUBJECT TO LOCAL LABOR LAW REQUIREMENTS,

INCLUDING CONSULTATION WITH APPROPRIATE WORK COUNCILS;



CHANGES IN ASSUMPTIONS RELATED TO

SEVERANCE AND POSTRETIREMENT COSTS;



FUTURE DISPOSITIONS;



NEW BUSINESS INITIATIVES AND

CHANGES IN PRODUCT ROADMAP, DEVELOPMENT, AND MANUFACTURING;



CHANGES IN EMPLOYMENT LEVELS AND

TURNOVER RATES;



CHANGES IN PRODUCT DEMAND AND THE

BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT, INCLUDING CHANGES RELATED TO THE CURRENT

UNCERTAINTY IN GLOBAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS; AND



CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF

CERTAIN LONG-LIVED ASSETS.

IN

ORDER TO COMPETE, WE MUST ATTRACT, RETAIN, AND MOTIVATE KEY

EMPLOYEES, AND OUR FAILURE TO DO SO COULD HARM OUR RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS.

IN ORDER TO COMPETE, WE MUST

ATTRACT, RETAIN, AND MOTIVATE EXECUTIVES AND OTHER KEY

EMPLOYEES. HIRING AND RETAINING QUALIFIED EXECUTIVES,

SCIENTISTS, ENGINEERS, TECHNICAL STAFF, AND SALES

REPRESENTATIVES ARE CRITICAL TO OUR BUSINESS, AND COMPETITION

FOR EXPERIENCED EMPLOYEES IN THE SEMICONDUCTOR INDUSTRY CAN BE

INTENSE. TO HELP ATTRACT, RETAIN, AND MOTIVATE QUALIFIED

EMPLOYEES, WE USE SHARE-BASED INCENTIVE AWARDS SUCH AS EMPLOYEE

STOCK OPTIONS AND NON-VESTED SHARE UNITS (RESTRICTED STOCK

UNITS). IF THE VALUE OF SUCH STOCK AWARDS DOES NOT APPRECIATE AS

MEASURED BY THE PERFORMANCE OF THE PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK, OR

IF OUR SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION OTHERWISE CEASES TO BE VIEWED AS

A VALUABLE BENEFIT, OUR ABILITY TO ATTRACT, RETAIN, AND MOTIVATE

EMPLOYEES COULD BE WEAKENED, WHICH COULD HARM OUR RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

OUR

FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH APPLICABLE ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND

REGULATIONS WORLDWIDE COULD HARM OUR BUSINESS AND RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS.

THE MANUFACTURING AND ASSEMBLING

AND TESTING OF OUR PRODUCTS REQUIRE THE USE OF HAZARDOUS

MATERIALS THAT ARE SUBJECT TO A BROAD ARRAY OF EHS LAWS AND

REGULATIONS. OUR FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH ANY OF THESE APPLICABLE

LAWS OR REGULATIONS COULD RESULT IN.



REGULATORY PENALTIES, FINES, AND

LEGAL LIABILITIES;



SUSPENSION OF PRODUCTION;



ALTERATION OF OUR FABRICATION AND

ASSEMBLY AND TEST PROCESSES; AND



CURTAILMENT OF OUR OPERATIONS OR

SALES.

IN ADDITION, OUR FAILURE TO MANAGE

THE USE, TRANSPORTATION, EMISSIONS, DISCHARGE, STORAGE,

RECYCLING, OR DISPOSAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS COULD SUBJECT US

TO INCREASED COSTS OR FUTURE LIABILITIES. EXISTING AND FUTURE

ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS COULD ALSO REQUIRE US TO

ACQUIRE POLLUTION ABATEMENT OR REMEDIATION EQUIPMENT, MODIFY OUR

PRODUCT DESIGNS, OR INCUR OTHER EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH SUCH

LAWS AND REGULATIONS. MANY NEW MATERIALS THAT WE ARE EVALUATING

FOR USE IN OUR OPERATIONS MAY BE SUBJECT TO REGULATION UNDER

EXISTING OR FUTURE ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS THAT MAY

RESTRICT OUR USE OF ONE OR MORE OF SUCH MATERIALS IN OUR

MANUFACTURING, ASSEMBLY AND TEST PROCESSES, OR PRODUCTS. ANY OF

THESE RESTRICTIONS COULD HARM OUR BUSINESS AND RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS BY INCREASING OUR EXPENSES OR REQUIRING US TO ALTER

OUR MANUFACTURING AND ASSEMBLY AND TEST PROCESSES.

CLIMATE

CHANGE POSES BOTH REGULATORY AND PHYSICAL RISKS THAT COULD HARM

OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR AFFECT THE WAY WE CONDUCT OUR

BUSINESS.

IN ADDITION TO THE POSSIBLE DIRECT

ECONOMIC IMPACT THAT CLIMATE CHANGE COULD HAVE ON US, CLIMATE

CHANGE MITIGATION PROGRAMS AND REGULATION CAN INCREASE OUR

COSTS. FOR EXAMPLE, THE COST OF PERFLUOROCOMPOUNDS (PFCS), A GAS

THAT WE USE IN OUR MANUFACTURING, COULD INCREASE OVER TIME UNDER

SOME CLIMATE-CHANGE-FOCUSED EMISSIONS TRADING PROGRAMS THAT MAY

BE IMPOSED BY GOVERNMENT REGULATION. IF THE USE OF PFCS IS

PROHIBITED, WE WOULD NEED TO OBTAIN SUBSTITUTE MATERIALS THAT

MAY COST MORE OR BE LESS AVAILABLE FOR OUR MANUFACTURING

OPERATIONS. WE ALSO SEE THE POTENTIAL FOR HIGHER ENERGY COSTS

DRIVEN BY CLIMATE CHANGE REGULATIONS. OUR COSTS COULD INCREASE

IF UTILITY COMPANIES PASS ON THEIR COSTS, SUCH AS THOSE

ASSOCIATED WITH CARBON TAXES, EMISSION CAP AND TRADE PROGRAMS,

OR RENEWABLE PORTFOLIO STANDARDS. WHILE WE MAINTAIN BUSINESS

RECOVERY PLANS THAT ARE INTENDED TO ALLOW US TO RECOVER FROM

NATURAL DISASTERS OR OTHER EVENTS THAT CAN BE DISRUPTIVE TO OUR

BUSINESS, WE CANNOT BE SURE THAT OUR PLANS WILL FULLY PROTECT US

FROM ALL SUCH DISASTERS OR EVENTS. MANY OF OUR OPERATIONS ARE

LOCATED IN SEMI-ARID REGIONS, SUCH AS ISRAEL AND THE

SOUTHWESTERN UNITED STATES. SOME SCENARIOS PREDICT THAT THESE

REGIONS MAY BECOME EVEN MORE VULNERABLE TO PROLONGED DROUGHTS

DUE TO CLIMATE CHANGE.

CHANGES

IN OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE MAY HARM OUR RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS.

A NUMBER OF FACTORS MAY INCREASE

OUR FUTURE EFFECTIVE TAX RATES, INCLUDING.



THE JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH PROFITS

ARE DETERMINED TO BE EARNED AND TAXED;



THE RESOLUTION OF ISSUES ARISING

FROM TAX AUDITS WITH VARIOUS TAX AUTHORITIES;



CHANGES IN THE VALUATION OF OUR

DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES;



ADJUSTMENTS TO INCOME TAXES UPON

FINALIZATION OF VARIOUS TAX RETURNS;



INCREASES IN EXPENSES NOT

DEDUCTIBLE FOR TAX PURPOSES, INCLUDING WRITE-OFFS OF ACQUIRED

IN-PROCESS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT AND IMPAIRMENTS OF GOODWILL

IN CONNECTION WITH ACQUISITIONS;



CHANGES IN AVAILABLE TAX CREDITS;



CHANGES IN TAX LAWS OR THE

INTERPRETATION OF SUCH TAX LAWS, AND CHANGES IN GENERALLY

ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES; AND



OUR DECISION TO REPATRIATE

NON-U.S. EARNINGS

FOR WHICH WE HAVE NOT PREVIOUSLY PROVIDED FOR U.S. TAXES.

ANY SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN OUR

FUTURE EFFECTIVE TAX RATES COULD REDUCE NET INCOME FOR FUTURE

PERIODS.

OUR

ACQUISITIONS, DIVESTITURES, AND OTHER TRANSACTIONS COULD DISRUPT

OUR ONGOING BUSINESS AND HARM OUR RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS.

IN PURSUING OUR BUSINESS STRATEGY,

WE ROUTINELY CONDUCT DISCUSSIONS, EVALUATE OPPORTUNITIES, AND

ENTER INTO AGREEMENTS REGARDING POSSIBLE INVESTMENTS,

ACQUISITIONS, DIVESTITURES, AND OTHER TRANSACTIONS, SUCH AS

JOINT VENTURES. ACQUISITIONS AND OTHER TRANSACTIONS INVOLVE

SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES AND RISKS, INCLUDING RISKS THAT.



WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO IDENTIFY

SUITABLE OPPORTUNITIES AT TERMS ACCEPTABLE TO US;



THE TRANSACTION MAY NOT ADVANCE

OUR BUSINESS STRATEGY;



WE MAY NOT REALIZE A SATISFACTORY

RETURN ON THE INVESTMENT WE MAKE;



WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO RETAIN KEY

PERSONNEL OF THE ACQUIRED BUSINESS; OR



WE MAY EXPERIENCE DIFFICULTY IN

INTEGRATING NEW EMPLOYEES, BUSINESS SYSTEMS, AND TECHNOLOGY.

WHEN WE DECIDE TO SELL ASSETS OR A

BUSINESS, WE MAY ENCOUNTER DIFFICULTY IN FINDING OR COMPLETING

DIVESTITURE OPPORTUNITIES OR ALTERNATIVE EXIT STRATEGIES ON

ACCEPTABLE TERMS IN A TIMELY MANNER, AND THE AGREED TERMS AND

FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS COULD BE RENEGOTIATED DUE TO CHANGES IN

BUSINESS OR MARKET CONDITIONS. THESE CIRCUMSTANCES COULD DELAY

THE ACCOMPLISHMENT OF OUR STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES OR CAUSE US TO

INCUR ADDITIONAL EXPENSES WITH RESPECT TO BUSINESSES THAT WE

WANT TO DISPOSE OF, OR WE MAY DISPOSE OF A BUSINESS AT A PRICE

OR ON TERMS THAT ARE LESS FAVORABLE THAN WE HAD ANTICIPATED,

RESULTING IN A LOSS ON THE TRANSACTION.

IF WE DO ENTER INTO AGREEMENTS

WITH RESPECT TO ACQUISITIONS, DIVESTITURES, OR OTHER

TRANSACTIONS, WE MAY FAIL TO COMPLETE THEM DUE TO.



FAILURE TO OBTAIN REQUIRED

REGULATORY OR OTHER APPROVALS;



INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY OR OTHER

LITIGATION;



DIFFICULTIES THAT WE OR OTHER

PARTIES MAY ENCOUNTER IN OBTAINING FINANCING FOR THE

TRANSACTION; OR



OTHER FACTORS.

FURTHER, ACQUISITIONS,

DIVESTITURES, AND OTHER TRANSACTIONS REQUIRE SUBSTANTIAL

MANAGEMENT RESOURCES AND HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO DIVERT OUR

ATTENTION FROM OUR EXISTING BUSINESS. THESE FACTORS COULD HARM

OUR BUSINESS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

ADDITIONALLY, SUBSEQUENT TO THE END OF 2008, MANAGEMENT APPROVED

PLANS TO RESTRUCTURE SOME OF OUR MANUFACTURING AND ASSEMBLY AND

TEST OPERATIONS, AND ALIGN OUR MANUFACTURING AND ASSEMBLY AND

TEST CAPACITY TO CURRENT MARKET CONDITIONS. THESE ACTIONS, WHICH

ARE EXPECTED TO TAKE PLACE BEGINNING IN 2009, INCLUDE CLOSING

TWO ASSEMBLY AND TEST FACILITIES IN MALAYSIA, ONE FACILITY IN

THE PHILIPPINES, AND ONE FACILITY IN CHINA; STOPPING PRODUCTION

AT A 200MM WAFER FABRICATION FACILITY IN OREGON; AND ENDING

PRODUCTION AT OUR 200MM WAFER FABRICATION FACILITY IN

CALIFORNIA. EXCEPT FOR THESE FACILITIES, WE BELIEVE THAT OUR

EXISTING FACILITIES ARE SUITABLE AND ADEQUATE. WE RECORDED

UNDER-UTILIZATION CHARGES IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2008 AS A

RESULT OF OUR DECISION TO REDUCE OUR FACILITY LOADINGS AT

CERTAIN FACILITIES, DUE TO A SIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN DEMAND. WE

EXPECT TO CONTINUE TO HAVE UNDER-UTILIZATION CHARGES IN 2009;

THE SLOWING OF THE WORLDWIDE

ECONOMY RESULTED IN A WEAK FOURTH QUARTER. THE PACE OF THE

REVENUE DECLINE IN THE FOURTH QUARTER WAS DRAMATIC AND RESULTED

FROM REDUCED DEMAND AND INVENTORY CONTRACTION ACROSS THE SUPPLY

CHAIN. THE 19% SEQUENTIAL DECLINE FROM THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2008

TO THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2008 WAS ONLY THE SECOND TIME IN THE

LAST 20 YEARS THAT OUR FOURTH-QUARTER REVENUE FELL BELOW OUR

THIRD-QUARTER REVENUE. IT IS UNCLEAR WHEN A TURNAROUND MAY

OCCUR, AND THERE REMAINS A HIGH DEGREE OF UNCERTAINTY AROUND

DEMAND, WHICH MAY CONTINUE TO DECLINE. HOWEVER, WE BELIEVE THAT

OUR COMPETITIVE POSITION, MANUFACTURING PROCESS TECHNOLOGIES,

CASH FLOW FROM OPERATIONS, AND BALANCE SHEET REMAIN STRONG, AND

THAT WE ARE WELL POSITIONED TO MANAGE THROUGH THIS ECONOMIC

DOWNTURN.

WE CONTINUE TO INVEST IN OUR

LEADING-EDGE TECHNOLOGIES AND GROWTH INITIATIVES IN ORDER TO

STRENGTHEN OUR COMPETITIVE POSITION AND ENTER NEW MARKET

SEGMENTS. WE HAVE A STRONG BELIEF THAT TECHNOLOGY COMPANIES

SUCCESSFULLY EMERGE FROM RECESSIONS WITH TOMORROWS

PRODUCTS, NOT TODAYS PRODUCTS. IN 2008, WE INTRODUCED THE

INTEL ATOM PROCESSOR FAMILY, WHICH IS DESIGNED TO ENABLE NEW

MOBILE INTERNET FORM FACTORS AT ATTRACTIVE SYSTEM PRICE POINTS.

OUR PRODUCT OFFERINGS CONTINUE TO STRENGTHEN, WITH THE LAUNCH OF

OUR NEW MICROARCHITECTURE, CODE-NAMED NEHALEM, IN

THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2008. ADDITIONALLY, WE EXPECT TO BEGIN

MANUFACTURING PRODUCTS USING OUR NEXT-GENERATION 32NM PROCESS

TECHNOLOGY IN THE SECOND HALF OF 2009, WHICH WE BELIEVE WILL

INCREASE PERFORMANCE AND ENERGY EFFICIENCY, AND LOWER PRODUCT

COSTS.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

MANAGEMENTS

DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)

OUR GROSS MARGIN TOWARD THE END OF

THE YEAR WAS IMPACTED BY APPROXIMATELY $250 MILLION OF FACTORY

UNDER-UTILIZATION CHARGES AS WELL AS INVENTORY WRITE-OFFS ON

COMPUTING-RELATED PRODUCTS, WHICH WERE PRIMARILY DEMAND-RELATED.

THE UNDER-UTILIZATION CHARGES WERE A RESULT OF OUR DECISION TO

REDUCE FACTORY LOADINGS AT THE END OF THE FOURTH QUARTER IN

RESPONSE TO THE DROP-OFF IN DEMAND. AS A RESULT, FACTORY

UNDER-UTILIZATION

CHARGES ARE EXPECTED TO INCREASE SIGNIFICANTLY IN THE FIRST

QUARTER, IMPACTING OUR GROSS MARGIN. WE ALSO EXPECT OUR GROSS

MARGIN TO BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED AS OUR

START-UP

COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR 32NM PROCESS TECHNOLOGY INCREASE AND

AS WE TRANSITION 32NM DESIGN RESOURCES FROM RESEARCH AND

DEVELOPMENT TO MANUFACTURING. ADDITIONALLY, CHANGES IN DEMAND

LEVELS AND PRICING OF PRODUCTS COULD IMPACT INVENTORY

WRITE-OFFS, MIX, AND UNIT COSTS, CREATING ADDITIONAL VARIABILITY

IN MARGIN. DESPITE REDUCING OUR FACTORY LOADINGS, WE INCREASED

OUR INVENTORY IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2008 DUE TO LOWER THAN

EXPECTED DEMAND AND INVENTORY REDUCTIONS IN THE SUPPLY CHAIN. WE

EXPECT FURTHER REDUCTION IN THE SUPPLY CHAIN INVENTORY LEVELS IN

THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2009 AS OUR CUSTOMERS MANAGE THEIR BUSINESS

THROUGH THE CURRENT ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTY. SUBSEQUENT TO THE END

OF 2008, MANAGEMENT APPROVED PLANS TO RESTRUCTURE SOME OF OUR

MANUFACTURING AND ASSEMBLY AND TEST OPERATIONS, AND ALIGN OUR

MANUFACTURING AND ASSEMBLY AND TEST CAPACITY TO CURRENT MARKET

CONDITIONS. THESE ACTIONS, WHICH ARE EXPECTED TO TAKE PLACE

BEGINNING IN 2009, INCLUDE CLOSING TWO ASSEMBLY AND TEST

FACILITIES IN MALAYSIA, ONE FACILITY IN THE PHILIPPINES, AND ONE

FACILITY IN CHINA; STOPPING PRODUCTION AT A 200MM WAFER

FABRICATION FACILITY IN OREGON; AND ENDING PRODUCTION AT OUR

200MM WAFER FABRICATION FACILITY IN CALIFORNIA.

WE CONTINUE TO FOCUS ON OUR

COMMITMENT TO EFFICIENCY AND CONTROLLING SPENDING. WE HAVE

REDUCED OUR HEADCOUNT BY OVER 2,000 FROM THE END OF 2007 AND

NEARLY 20,000 FROM OUR HIGHEST LEVELS DURING 2006. DURING 2008,

WE HAD ADDITIONAL DIVESTITURES OF NON-STRATEGIC BUSINESSES AND

DIVESTED OUR NOR FLASH MEMORY BUSINESS. ALSO, IN A JOINT

DECISION WITH MICRON, WE DISCONTINUED THE SUPPLY OF NAND FLASH

MEMORY FROM A 200MM FACILITY WITHIN THE IMFT MANUFACTURING

NETWORK, WHICH RESULTED IN RESTRUCTURING CHARGES OF $215 MILLION.

IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2008, WE

MADE A $1.0 BILLION INVESTMENT IN CLEARWIRE LLC, ADDING TO OUR

PRE-EXISTING INVESTMENTS. HOWEVER, WE RECORDED AN IMPAIRMENT OF

OUR INVESTMENTS IN THE NEW CLEARWIRE CORPORATION AND CLEARWIRE

LLC OF $938 MILLION, PRIMARILY DUE TO THE FAIR VALUE BEING

SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER THAN THE COST BASIS OF OUR INVESTMENTS.

FROM A FINANCIAL CONDITION

PERSPECTIVE, WE ENDED 2008 WITH AN INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO VALUED

AT $14.5 BILLION, CONSISTING OF CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS AND

MARKETABLE DEBT INSTRUMENTS INCLUDED IN TRADING ASSETS AND

SHORT- AND LONG-TERM INVESTMENTS. IN ADDITION, WE GENERATED

$10.9 BILLION IN CASH FROM OPERATIONS IN 2008. THE CREDIT

QUALITY OF OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO REMAINS HIGH DURING THIS

DIFFICULT CREDIT ENVIRONMENT, WITH OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY

IMPAIRMENTS ON OUR AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE INVESTMENTS IN DEBT

INSTRUMENTS LIMITED TO $44 MILLION DURING 2008. IN ADDITION, WE

CONTINUE TO BE ABLE TO INVEST IN HIGH-QUALITY INVESTMENTS.

HOWEVER, WE HAVE SEEN A REDUCTION IN THE VOLUME OF AVAILABLE

COMMERCIAL PAPER FROM CERTAIN MARKET SEGMENTS. AS A RESULT, OUR

INVESTMENTS IN SHORT-TERM GOVERNMENT FUNDS HAVE INCREASED, WHICH

WILL REDUCE OUR AVERAGE INVESTMENT RETURN. DESPITE THE

TIGHTENING OF THE CREDIT MARKETS, WE CONTINUE TO BE ABLE TO

ACCESS FUNDS THROUGH THE CREDIT MARKETS, INCLUDING THROUGH THE

ISSUANCE OF COMMERCIAL PAPER. WITH THE EXCEPTION OF A LIMITED

AMOUNT OF INVESTMENTS FOR WHICH WE HAVE RECOGNIZED

OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENTS, WE HAVE NOT SEEN SIGNIFICANT

LIQUIDATION DELAYS, AND FOR THOSE THAT HAVE MATURED WE HAVE

RECEIVED THE FULL PAR VALUE OF OUR ORIGINAL DEBT INVESTMENTS.

FOR ADDITIONAL DETAILS ON OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO, SEE

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES.

DURING 2008, WE REPURCHASED $7.1

BILLION OF STOCK THROUGH OUR STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM AND PAID

$3.1 BILLION TO STOCKHOLDERS AS DIVIDENDS. IN THE FOURTH QUARTER

OF 2008, WE DID NOT REPURCHASE ADDITIONAL STOCK, AS WE FELT THAT

IT WAS BETTER TO CONSERVE CASH, GIVEN THE ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT.

IN JANUARY 2009, OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS DECLARED A DIVIDEND OF

$0.14 PER COMMON SHARE FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2009.

STRATEGY

OUR GOAL IS TO BE THE PREEMINENT

PROVIDER OF SEMICONDUCTOR CHIPS AND PLATFORMS FOR THE WORLDWIDE

DIGITAL ECONOMY. AS PART OF OUR OVERALL STRATEGY TO COMPETE IN

EACH RELEVANT MARKET SEGMENT, WE USE OUR CORE COMPETENCIES IN

THE DESIGN AND MANUFACTURE OF INTEGRATED CIRCUITS, AS WELL AS

OUR FINANCIAL RESOURCES, GLOBAL PRESENCE, AND BRAND RECOGNITION.

WE BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE THE SCALE, CAPACITY, AND GLOBAL REACH TO

ESTABLISH NEW TECHNOLOGIES AND RESPOND TO CUSTOMERS NEEDS

QUICKLY.

SOME OF OUR KEY FOCUS AREAS ARE

LISTED BELOW.



CUSTOMER

ORIENTATION.

OUR

STRATEGY FOCUSES ON DEVELOPING OUR NEXT GENERATION OF PRODUCTS

BASED ON THE NEEDS AND EXPECTATIONS OF OUR CUSTOMERS. IN TURN,

OUR PRODUCTS HELP ENABLE THE DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT OF NEW FORM

FACTORS AND USAGE MODELS FOR BUSINESSES AND CONSUMERS. WE OFFER

PLATFORMS THAT INCORPORATE VARIOUS COMPONENTS DESIGNED AND

CONFIGURED TO WORK TOGETHER TO PROVIDE AN OPTIMIZED USER

COMPUTING SOLUTION COMPARED TO COMPONENTS THAT ARE USED

SEPARATELY.



ARCHITECTURE AND

PLATFORMS.

WE ARE

DEVELOPING INTEGRATED PLATFORM SOLUTIONS BY MOVING THE MEMORY

CONTROLLER AND GRAPHICS FUNCTIONALITY FROM THE CHIPSET TO THE

MICROPROCESSOR. THIS PLATFORM REPARTITIONING IS DESIGNED TO

PROVIDE IMPROVED PERFORMANCE DUE TO HIGHER INTEGRATION, LOWER

POWER CONSUMPTION, AND REDUCED PLATFORM SIZE. IN ADDITION, WE

ARE FOCUSING ON IMPROVED

ENERGY-EFFICIENT

PERFORMANCE FOR COMPUTING AND COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEMS AND

DEVICES. IMPROVED ENERGY-EFFICIENT PERFORMANCE INVOLVES

BALANCING IMPROVED PERFORMANCE WITH LOWER POWER CONSUMPTION. WE

CONTINUE TO DEVELOP MULTI-CORE MICROPROCESSORS WITH AN

INCREASING NUMBER OF CORES, WHICH ENABLE IMPROVED MULTITASKING

AND ENERGY EFFICIENCY. WE ARE ALSO FOCUSING ON THE DEVELOPMENT

OF A NEW HIGHLY SCALABLE, MANY-CORE ARCHITECTURE AIMED AT

PARALLEL PROCESSING. THIS ARCHITECTURE WILL INITIALLY BE USED IN

DEVELOPING DISCRETE GRAPHICS PROCESSORS DESIGNED FOR GAMING AND

MEDIA CREATION. OVER TIME, THIS ARCHITECTURE MAY BE UTILIZED IN

THE DEVELOPMENT OF PRODUCTS FOR SCIENTIFIC AND PROFESSIONAL

WORKSTATIONS AS WELL AS HIGH-PERFORMANCE COMPUTING APPLICATIONS.



SILICON AND MANUFACTURING

TECHNOLOGY

LEADERSHIP.

OUR

STRATEGY FOR DEVELOPING MICROPROCESSORS WITH IMPROVED

PERFORMANCE IS TO SYNCHRONIZE THE INTRODUCTION OF A NEW

MICROARCHITECTURE WITH IMPROVEMENTS IN SILICON PROCESS

TECHNOLOGY. WE PLAN TO INTRODUCE A NEW MICROARCHITECTURE

APPROXIMATELY EVERY TWO YEARS AND RAMP THE NEXT GENERATION OF

SILICON PROCESS TECHNOLOGY IN THE INTERVENING YEARS. THIS

COORDINATED SCHEDULE ALLOWS US TO DEVELOP AND INTRODUCE NEW

PRODUCTS BASED ON A COMMON MICROARCHITECTURE QUICKLY, WITHOUT

WAITING FOR THE NEXT GENERATION OF SILICON PROCESS TECHNOLOGY.

WE REFER TO THIS AS OUR TICK-TOCK TECHNOLOGY

DEVELOPMENT CADENCE.



STRATEGIC

INVESTMENTS.

WE

MAKE EQUITY INVESTMENTS IN COMPANIES AROUND THE WORLD THAT WE

BELIEVE WILL GENERATE RETURNS, FURTHER OUR STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES,

AND SUPPORT OUR KEY BUSINESS INITIATIVES. OUR INVESTMENTS,

INCLUDING THOSE MADE THROUGH OUR INTEL CAPITAL PROGRAM,

GENERALLY FOCUS ON INVESTING IN COMPANIES AND INITIATIVES TO

STIMULATE GROWTH IN THE DIGITAL ECONOMY, CREATE NEW BUSINESS

OPPORTUNITIES FOR INTEL, AND EXPAND GLOBAL MARKETS FOR OUR

PRODUCTS. OUR CURRENT INVESTMENTS FOCUS ON THE FOLLOWING AREAS.

ADVANCING FLASH MEMORY PRODUCTS, ENABLING MOBILE WIRELESS

DEVICES, ADVANCING THE DIGITAL HOME, ENHANCING THE DIGITAL

ENTERPRISE, ADVANCING HIGH-PERFORMANCE COMMUNICATIONS

INFRASTRUCTURES, AND DEVELOPING THE NEXT GENERATION OF SILICON

PROCESS TECHNOLOGIES. OUR FOCUS AREAS AND INVESTMENT ACTIVITIES

TEND TO DEVELOP AND CHANGE OVER TIME DUE TO RAPID ADVANCEMENTS

IN TECHNOLOGY AND CHANGES IN THE ECONOMIC CLIMATE.



BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT AND

SOFTWARE.

WE

BELIEVE THAT WE ARE WELL POSITIONED IN THE TECHNOLOGY INDUSTRY

TO HELP DRIVE INNOVATION, FOSTER COLLABORATION, AND PROMOTE

INDUSTRY STANDARDS THAT WILL YIELD INNOVATION AND IMPROVED

TECHNOLOGIES FOR USERS. WE PLAN TO CONTINUE TO CULTIVATE NEW

BUSINESSES AND WORK TO ENCOURAGE THE INDUSTRY TO OFFER PRODUCTS

THAT TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE LATEST MARKET TRENDS AND USAGE

MODELS. WE FREQUENTLY PARTICIPATE IN INDUSTRY INITIATIVES

DESIGNED TO DISCUSS AND AGREE UPON TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS AND

OTHER ASPECTS OF TECHNOLOGIES THAT COULD BE ADOPTED AS STANDARDS

BY STANDARDS-SETTING ORGANIZATIONS. IN ADDITION, WE WORK

COLLABORATIVELY WITH OTHER COMPANIES TO PROTECT DIGITAL CONTENT

AND THE CONSUMER. LASTLY, THROUGH OUR SOFTWARE AND SERVICES

GROUP (SSG), WE HELP ENABLE AND ADVANCE THE COMPUTING ECOSYSTEM

BY PROVIDING DEVELOPMENT TOOLS AND SUPPORT TO HELP SOFTWARE

DEVELOPERS CREATE SOFTWARE APPLICATIONS AND OPERATING SYSTEMS

THAT TAKE ADVANTAGE OF OUR PLATFORMS.

WE BELIEVE THAT THE PROLIFERATION

OF THE INTERNET, INCLUDING USER DEMAND FOR PREMIUM CONTENT AND

RICH MEDIA, DRIVES THE NEED FOR GREATER PERFORMANCE IN PCS AND

SERVERS. A GROWING NUMBER OF OLDER PCS ARE INCREASINGLY

INCAPABLE OF HANDLING THE TASKS THAT USERS DEMAND, SUCH AS

STREAMING VIDEO, UPLOADING PHOTOS, AND ONLINE GAMING. AS THESE

TASKS BECOME EVEN MORE DEMANDING AND REQUIRE MORE COMPUTING

POWER, WE BELIEVE THAT USERS WILL NEED AND WANT TO BUY NEW PCS

TO PERFORM EVERYDAY TASKS ON THE INTERNET. WE ALSO BELIEVE THAT

INCREASED INTERNET TRAFFIC CREATES A NEED FOR GREATER SERVER

INFRASTRUCTURE, INCLUDING SERVER PRODUCTS OPTIMIZED FOR

ENERGY-EFFICIENT PERFORMANCE.

THE TREND OF MOBILE MICROPROCESSOR

UNIT GROWTH OUTPACING THE GROWTH IN DESKTOP MICROPROCESSOR UNITS

HAS CONTINUED, AND SHIPMENTS OF OUR MOBILE MICROPROCESSORS

EXCEEDED OUR DESKTOP MICROPROCESSORS FOR THE FIRST TIME IN THE

SECOND QUARTER OF 2008. WE BELIEVE THAT THE DEMAND FOR MOBILE

MICROPROCESSORS WILL RESULT IN THE INCREASED DEVELOPMENT OF

PRODUCTS WITH FORM FACTORS AND USES THAT REQUIRE LOW-POWER

MICROPROCESSORS.

OUR SILICON AND MANUFACTURING

TECHNOLOGY LEADERSHIP ALLOWS US TO DEVELOP LOW-POWER

MICROPROCESSORS FOR NEW USES AND FORM FACTORS. WE BELIEVE THAT

THESE LOW-POWER MICROPROCESSORS GIVE US THE ABILITY TO EXTEND

INTEL ARCHITECTURE AND DRIVE GROWTH IN NEW MARKET SEGMENTS,

INCLUDING A GROWING NUMBER OF PRODUCTS THAT REQUIRE PROCESSORS

SPECIFICALLY DESIGNED FOR EMBEDDED SOLUTIONS, MIDS, CONSUMER

ELECTRONICS DEVICES, NETTOPS, AND NETBOOKS. WE BELIEVE THAT THE

COMMON ELEMENTS FOR PRODUCTS IN THESE NEW MARKET SEGMENTS ARE

LOW POWER CONSUMPTION AND THE ABILITY TO ACCESS THE INTERNET. WE

ALSO OFFER, AND ARE CONTINUING TO DEVELOP, SOC PRODUCTS THAT

INTEGRATE CORE PROCESSING FUNCTIONALITY WITH SPECIFIC

COMPONENTS, SUCH AS GRAPHICS, AUDIO, AND VIDEO, ONTO A SINGLE

CHIP TO FORM A PURPOSE-BUILT SOLUTION. THIS INTEGRATION REDUCES

COST, POWER CONSUMPTION, AND SIZE.

STRATEGY

BY OPERATING SEGMENT

WE COMPLETED A REORGANIZATION IN

THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2008 THAT TRANSFERRED THE REVENUE AND

COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH A PORTION OF THE DIGITAL HOME GROUPS

CONSUMER PC COMPONENTS BUSINESS TO THE DIGITAL ENTERPRISE GROUP.

THE DIGITAL HOME GROUP NOW FOCUSES ON THE CONSUMER ELECTRONICS

COMPONENTS BUSINESS. THE STRATEGY BY OPERATING SEGMENT PRESENTED

BELOW IS BASED ON THE NEW ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE.

CRITICAL

ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

THE METHODS, ESTIMATES, AND

JUDGMENTS THAT WE USE IN APPLYING OUR ACCOUNTING POLICIES HAVE A

SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE RESULTS THAT WE REPORT IN OUR

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. SOME OF OUR ACCOUNTING POLICIES REQUIRE US

TO MAKE DIFFICULT AND SUBJECTIVE JUDGMENTS, OFTEN AS A RESULT OF

THE NEED TO MAKE ESTIMATES REGARDING MATTERS THAT ARE INHERENTLY

UNCERTAIN. OUR MOST CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES INCLUDE.



THE VALUATION OF NON-MARKETABLE

EQUITY INVESTMENTS AND THE DETERMINATION OF OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY

IMPAIRMENTS, WHICH IMPACT GAINS (LOSSES) ON EQUITY METHOD

INVESTMENTS, NET, OR GAINS (LOSSES) ON OTHER EQUITY INVESTMENTS,

NET WHEN WE RECORD IMPAIRMENTS;



THE VALUATION OF INVESTMENTS IN

DEBT INSTRUMENTS AND THE DETERMINATION OF OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY

IMPAIRMENTS, WHICH IMPACT OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO BALANCE WHEN

WE ASSESS FAIR VALUE, AND INTEREST AND OTHER, NET WHEN WE RECORD

IMPAIRMENTS OF

AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE

DEBT INSTRUMENTS;



THE ASSESSMENT OF RECOVERABILITY

OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS, WHICH PRIMARILY IMPACTS GROSS MARGIN OR

OPERATING EXPENSES WHEN WE RECORD ASSET IMPAIRMENTS OR

ACCELERATE THEIR DEPRECIATION;



THE RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT OF

CURRENT AND DEFERRED INCOME TAXES (INCLUDING THE MEASUREMENT OF

UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS), WHICH IMPACT OUR PROVISION FOR TAXES;

AND



THE VALUATION OF INVENTORY, WHICH

IMPACTS GROSS MARGIN.

BELOW, WE DISCUSS THESE POLICIES

FURTHER, AS WELL AS THE ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS INVOLVED. WE

ALSO HAVE OTHER POLICIES THAT WE CONSIDER KEY ACCOUNTING

POLICIES, SUCH AS THOSE FOR REVENUE RECOGNITION, INCLUDING THE

DEFERRAL OF REVENUE ON SALES TO DISTRIBUTORS; HOWEVER, THESE

POLICIES TYPICALLY DO NOT REQUIRE US TO MAKE ESTIMATES OR

JUDGMENTS THAT ARE DIFFICULT OR SUBJECTIVE.

NON-MARKETABLE

EQUITY INVESTMENTS

THE CARRYING VALUE OF OUR

NON-MARKETABLE EQUITY INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO, EXCLUDING EQUITY

DERIVATIVES, TOTALED $4.1 BILLION AS OF DECEMBER 27,

2008 ($3.4 BILLION AS OF DECEMBER 29, 2007). THE

MAJORITY OF THE BALANCE AS OF DECEMBER 27, 2008 WAS

CONCENTRATED IN COMPANIES IN THE FLASH MEMORY MARKET SEGMENT AND

WIRELESS CONNECTIVITY MARKET SEGMENT. OUR FLASH MEMORY MARKET

SEGMENT INVESTMENTS INCLUDE OUR INVESTMENT IN IMFT OF

$1.7 BILLION ($2.2 BILLION AS OF DECEMBER 29,

2007), OUR INVESTMENT IN IM FLASH SINGAPORE, LLP (IMFS) OF

$329 MILLION ($146 MILLION AS OF DECEMBER 29,

2007), AND OUR INVESTMENT IN NUMONYX OF $484 MILLION. OUR

WIRELESS CONNECTIVITY MARKET SEGMENT INVESTMENTS INCLUDE OUR

NON-MARKETABLE INVESTMENT IN CLEARWIRE LLC OF $238 MILLION

(SEE NOTE 5: AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE INVESTMENTS IN

PART II, ITEM 8 OF THIS

FORM 10-K

FOR INFORMATION ON OUR ADDITIONAL MARKETABLE EQUITY INVESTMENT

IN THE NEW CLEARWIRE CORPORATION OF $148 MILLION). IN

ADDITION, WE REGULARLY INVEST IN NON-MARKETABLE EQUITY

INSTRUMENTS OF PRIVATE COMPANIES, WHICH RANGE FROM EARLY-STAGE

COMPANIES THAT ARE OFTEN STILL DEFINING THEIR STRATEGIC

DIRECTION TO MORE MATURE COMPANIES WITH ESTABLISHED REVENUE

STREAMS AND BUSINESS MODELS. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION, SEE

NOTE 6: EQUITY METHOD AND COST METHOD

INVESTMENTS IN PART II, ITEM 8 OF THIS

FORM 10-K.

OUR NON-MARKETABLE EQUITY

INVESTMENTS ARE RECORDED USING ADJUSTED HISTORICAL COST BASIS OR

THE EQUITY METHOD OF ACCOUNTING, DEPENDING ON THE FACTS AND

CIRCUMSTANCES OF EACH INVESTMENT (SEE NOTE 2.

ACCOUNTING POLICIES IN PART II, ITEM 8 OF THIS

NON-MARKETABLE

EQUITY INVESTMENTS ARE CLASSIFIED IN OTHER LONG-TERM ASSETS ON

THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

MANAGEMENTS

DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)

NON-MARKETABLE EQUITY INVESTMENTS

ARE INHERENTLY RISKY, AND A NUMBER OF THE COMPANIES IN WHICH WE

INVEST ARE LIKELY TO FAIL. THEIR SUCCESS IS DEPENDENT ON PRODUCT

DEVELOPMENT, MARKET ACCEPTANCE, OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCY, AND

OTHER KEY BUSINESS FACTORS. DEPENDING ON THEIR FUTURE PROSPECTS,

THE COMPANIES MAY NOT BE ABLE TO RAISE ADDITIONAL FUNDS WHEN

NEEDED OR THEY MAY RECEIVE LOWER VALUATIONS, WITH LESS FAVORABLE

INVESTMENT TERMS THAN IN PREVIOUS FINANCINGS, AND OUR

INVESTMENTS WOULD LIKELY BECOME IMPAIRED. ADDITIONALLY, THE

CURRENT FINANCIAL MARKETS ARE EXTREMELY VOLATILE AND THERE HAS

BEEN A TIGHTENING OF THE CREDIT MARKETS, WHICH COULD NEGATIVELY

AFFECT THE PROSPECTS OF THE COMPANIES WE INVEST IN, THEIR

ABILITY TO RAISE ADDITIONAL CAPITAL, AND THE LIKELIHOOD OF OUR

BEING ABLE TO REALIZE VALUE IN OUR INVESTMENTS THROUGH LIQUIDITY

EVENTS SUCH AS INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERINGS, MERGERS, AND PRIVATE

SALES. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO

RISKS, INCLUDING THOSE SPECIFIC TO OUR INVESTMENTS IN THE FLASH

MEMORY MARKET SEGMENT AND WIRELESS CONNECTIVITY MARKET SEGMENT,

SEE RISK FACTORS IN PART I, ITEM 1A OF

THIS

FORM 10-K.

WE REVIEW OUR INVESTMENTS

QUARTERLY FOR INDICATORS OF IMPAIRMENT; HOWEVER, FOR

NON-MARKETABLE EQUITY INVESTMENTS, THE IMPAIRMENT ANALYSIS

REQUIRES SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT TO IDENTIFY EVENTS OR

CIRCUMSTANCES THAT WOULD SIGNIFICANTLY HARM THE FAIR VALUE OF

THE INVESTMENT. THE INDICATORS THAT WE USE TO IDENTIFY THOSE

EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES PRIMARILY INCLUDE.



THE INVESTEES REVENUE AND

EARNINGS TRENDS RELATIVE TO PREDEFINED MILESTONES AND OVERALL

BUSINESS PROSPECTS;



THE TECHNOLOGICAL FEASIBILITY OF

THE INVESTEES PRODUCTS AND TECHNOLOGIES;



THE GENERAL MARKET CONDITIONS IN

THE INVESTEES INDUSTRY OR GEOGRAPHIC AREA, INCLUDING

ADVERSE REGULATORY OR ECONOMIC CHANGES;



FACTORS RELATED TO THE

INVESTEES ABILITY TO REMAIN IN BUSINESS, SUCH AS THE

INVESTEES LIQUIDITY, DEBT RATIOS, AND THE RATE AT WHICH

THE INVESTEE IS USING ITS CASH; AND



THE INVESTEES RECEIPT OF

ADDITIONAL FUNDING AT A LOWER VALUATION.

INVESTMENTS THAT WE IDENTIFY AS

HAVING AN INDICATOR OF IMPAIRMENT ARE SUBJECT TO FURTHER

ANALYSIS TO DETERMINE IF THE FAIR VALUE OF THE INVESTMENT IS

BELOW OUR CARRYING VALUE. IF THE FAIR VALUE OF THE INVESTMENT IS

BELOW OUR CARRYING VALUE, WE DETERMINE IF THE INVESTMENT IS

OTHER THAN TEMPORARILY IMPAIRED BASED ON THE SEVERITY AND

DURATION OF THE IMPAIRMENT. IF THE INVESTMENT IS CONSIDERED TO

BE OTHER THAN TEMPORARILY IMPAIRED, WE WRITE DOWN THE INVESTMENT

TO ITS FAIR VALUE. BEGINNING IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2008, THE

ASSESSMENT OF FAIR VALUE FOR NON-MARKETABLE INVESTMENTS IS BASED

ON THE PROVISIONS OF STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

(SFAS) NO. 157, FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

(SFAS NO. 157), AS AMENDED. WITH THE EXCEPTION OF

CLEARWIRE LLC, WE CLASSIFIED OUR IMPAIRED NON-MARKETABLE

INVESTMENTS AS LEVEL 3, AS WE USE UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS TO

THE VALUATION METHODOLOGY THAT ARE SIGNIFICANT TO THE FAIR VALUE

MEASUREMENT, AND THE VALUATION REQUIRES MANAGEMENT JUDGMENT DUE

TO THE ABSENCE OF QUOTED MARKET PRICES AND INHERENT LACK OF

LIQUIDITY. WE CLASSIFIED OUR INVESTMENT IN CLEARWIRE LLC AS

LEVEL 2, AS THE UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS TO THE VALUATION

METHODOLOGY WERE NOT SIGNIFICANT TO THE FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT.

SEE NOTE 3: FAIR VALUE IN PART II,

ITEM 8 OF THIS

FORM 10-K.

IMPAIRMENTS OF NON-MARKETABLE

EQUITY INVESTMENTS WERE $1.2 BILLION IN 2008. OVER THE PAST

12 QUARTERS, INCLUDING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2008, IMPAIRMENTS

OF NON-MARKETABLE EQUITY INVESTMENTS HAVE RANGED FROM

$10 MILLION TO $896 MILLION PER QUARTER.

THE FOLLOWING IS A DISCUSSION OF

THE METHODS, ESTIMATES, AND JUDGMENTS THAT MANAGEMENT USES IN

OUR ANALYSIS TO DETERMINE IF OUR

NON-MARKETABLE

EQUITY INVESTMENTS ARE OTHER THAN TEMPORARILY IMPAIRED.

IMFT/IMFS

IMFT AND IMFS ARE VARIABLE

INTEREST ENTITIES THAT ARE DESIGNED TO MANUFACTURE AND SELL NAND

PRODUCTS TO INTEL AND MICRON AT MANUFACTURING COST. OUR NAND

SOLUTIONS GROUP OPERATING SEGMENT PURCHASES 49% OF THESE NAND

PRODUCTS FROM IMFT AND SELLS THEM TO OUR CUSTOMERS. AS A RESULT,

WE GENERATE CASH FLOWS FROM OUR INVESTMENTS IN IMFT, IMFS, AND

OUR INTANGIBLE ASSETS RELATED TO THE NAND PRODUCT DESIGNS

THROUGH OUR NAND SOLUTIONS GROUP BUSINESS. THEREFORE, WE

DETERMINE THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR INVESTMENTS IN IMFT AND IMFS

USING THE INCOME APPROACH, BASED ON A WEIGHTED AVERAGE OF

MULTIPLE DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW SCENARIOS OF OUR NAND SOLUTIONS

GROUP BUSINESS.

32

TABLE OF CONTENTS

MANAGEMENTS

DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)

THE DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW SCENARIOS

REQUIRE THE USE OF UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS, INCLUDING ASSUMPTIONS OF

PROJECTED REVENUES (INCLUDING PRODUCT VOLUME, PRODUCT MIX, AND

AVERAGE SELLING PRICES), EXPENSES, CAPITAL SPENDING, AND OTHER

COSTS, AS WELL AS A DISCOUNT RATE. ESTIMATES OF PROJECTED

REVENUES, EXPENSES, CAPITAL SPENDING, AND OTHER COSTS ARE

DEVELOPED BY IMFT, IMFS, AND INTEL USING HISTORICAL DATA AND

AVAILABLE MARKET DATA. MANAGEMENT ALSO DETERMINES HOW MULTIPLE

DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW SCENARIOS ARE WEIGHTED IN THE FAIR VALUE

DETERMINATION. ADDITIONALLY, THE DEVELOPMENT OF SEVERAL INPUTS

USED IN OUR INCOME MODEL (SUCH AS DISCOUNT RATE AND TAX RATE)

REQUIRES THE SELECTION OF COMPARABLE COMPANIES WITHIN THE NAND

FLASH MEMORY MARKET SEGMENT. THE SELECTION OF COMPARABLE

COMPANIES REQUIRES MANAGEMENT JUDGMENT AND IS BASED ON A NUMBER

OF FACTORS, INCLUDING NAND PRODUCTS AND SERVICES LINES WITHIN

THE FLASH MEMORY MARKET SEGMENT, COMPARABLE COMPANIES

SIZES, GROWTH RATES, AND OTHER RELEVANT FACTORS. BASED ON OUR

FAIR VALUE DETERMINATION, THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR INVESTMENT IN

IMFT AND IMFS APPROXIMATED CARRYING VALUE AS OF

DECEMBER 27, 2008.

CHANGES IN MANAGEMENT ESTIMATES TO

THE UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS WOULD CHANGE THE VALUATION OF THE

INVESTMENT. THE ESTIMATES FOR THE PROJECTED REVENUE AND DISCOUNT

RATE ARE THE ASSUMPTIONS THAT MOST SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT THE FAIR

VALUE DETERMINATION. FOR EXAMPLE, THE IMPACT OF A 5% DECLINE IN

PROJECTED REVENUE IN EACH OF OUR CASH FLOW SCENARIOS COULD

RESULT IN A DECLINE IN THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR INVESTMENT OF UP TO

APPROXIMATELY $300 MILLION. THE IMPACT OF A ONE PERCENTAGE

POINT INCREASE IN THE DISCOUNT RATE WOULD RESULT IN A DECLINE IN

THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR INVESTMENT OF APPROXIMATELY

$225 MILLION.

THE FAIR VALUE DETERMINED BY THE

INCOME APPROACH IS COMPARED TO THE CARRYING VALUE OF OUR

INVESTMENTS IN IMFT AND IMFS AND OUR INTANGIBLE ASSET RELATED TO

THE NAND PRODUCT DESIGNS THAT WE PURCHASED FROM MICRON AS PART

OF THE FORMATION OF IMFT. WE DID NOT HAVE AN

OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENT ON OUR INVESTMENTS IN IMFT AND

IMFS IN 2008, 2007, OR 2006.

NUMONYX

WE DETERMINE THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR

INVESTMENT IN NUMONYX USING A COMBINATION OF THE INCOME APPROACH

AND THE MARKET APPROACH. THE INCOME APPROACH INCLUDES THE USE OF

A WEIGHTED AVERAGE OF MULTIPLE DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW SCENARIOS OF

NUMONYX, WHICH REQUIRES THE USE OF UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS,

INCLUDING ASSUMPTIONS OF PROJECTED REVENUES, EXPENSES, CAPITAL

SPENDING, AND OTHER COSTS, AS WELL AS A DISCOUNT RATE CALCULATED

BASED ON THE RISK PROFILE OF THE FLASH MEMORY MARKET SEGMENT.

ESTIMATES OF PROJECTED REVENUES, EXPENSES, CAPITAL SPENDING, AND

OTHER COSTS ARE DEVELOPED BY NUMONYX AND INTEL. THE MARKET

APPROACH INCLUDES USING FINANCIAL METRICS AND RATIOS OF

COMPARABLE PUBLIC COMPANIES, SUCH AS PROJECTED REVENUES,

EXPENSES, AND OTHER COSTS. THE SELECTION OF COMPARABLE COMPANIES

USED IN THE MARKET APPROACH REQUIRES MANAGEMENT JUDGMENT AND IS

BASED ON A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING NOR PRODUCTS AND

SERVICES LINES WITHIN THE FLASH MEMORY MARKET SEGMENT,

COMPARABLE COMPANIES SIZES, GROWTH RATES, AND OTHER

RELEVANT FACTORS.

CHANGES IN MANAGEMENT ESTIMATES TO

THE UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS IN OUR VALUATION MODELS WOULD CHANGE THE

VALUATION OF THE INVESTMENT. THE ESTIMATED PROJECTED REVENUE IS

THE ASSUMPTION THAT MOST SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTS THE FAIR VALUE

DETERMINATION. FOR EXAMPLE, THE IMPACT OF A 5% DECLINE IN

PROJECTED REVENUE TO EACH OF OUR MODELS AND CASH FLOW SCENARIOS

COULD RESULT IN A DECLINE IN THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR INVESTMENT OF

UP TO APPROXIMATELY $140 MILLION. MANAGEMENT JUDGMENT IS

INVOLVED IN DETERMINING HOW THE INCOME APPROACH AND THE MARKET

APPROACH ARE WEIGHTED IN THE FAIR VALUE DETERMINATION. OUR FAIR

VALUE DETERMINATION WAS MORE HEAVILY WEIGHTED TOWARD THE MARKET

APPROACH DUE TO THE COMPARABILITY OF SIMILAR COMPANIES IN THE

MARKET AND THE AVAILABILITY OF MARKET-BASED DATA. INCREASING THE

RELATIVE WEIGHTING OF THE INCOME APPROACH WOULD HAVE RESULTED IN

A DECLINE IN THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR INVESTMENT BY APPROXIMATELY

$30 MILLION.

WE RECORDED A $250 MILLION

IMPAIRMENT CHARGE ON OUR INVESTMENT IN NUMONYX DURING THE THIRD

QUARTER OF 2008 TO WRITE DOWN OUR INVESTMENT TO ITS FAIR VALUE.

ESTIMATES FOR REVENUE, EARNINGS, AND FUTURE CASH FLOWS WERE

REVISED LOWER DUE TO A GENERAL DECLINE IN THE NOR FLASH MEMORY

MARKET SEGMENT.

CLEARWIRE

LLC

WE DETERMINE THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR

INVESTMENT IN CLEARWIRE LLC PRIMARILY USING THE QUOTED PRICES OF

ITS PARENT COMPANY, THE NEW CLEARWIRE CORPORATION. THE EFFECTS

OF ADJUSTING THE QUOTED PRICE FOR PREMIUMS THAT WE BELIEVE

MARKET PARTICIPANTS WOULD CONSIDER FOR CLEARWIRE LLC, SUCH AS

TAX BENEFITS AND VOTING RIGHTS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR INVESTMENT,

WERE MOSTLY OFFSET BY THE EFFECTS OF DISCOUNTS TO THE FAIR

VALUE, SUCH AS THOSE DUE TO TRANSFER RESTRICTIONS, LACK OF

LIQUIDITY, AND DIFFERENCES IN DIVIDEND RIGHTS THAT ARE INCLUDED

IN THE VALUE OF THE NEW CLEARWIRE CORPORATION STOCK. DURING THE

FOURTH QUARTER OF 2008, WE RECORDED A $762 MILLION

IMPAIRMENT CHARGE ON OUR INVESTMENT IN CLEARWIRE LLC TO WRITE

DOWN OUR INVESTMENT TO ITS FAIR VALUE, PRIMARILY DUE TO THE FAIR

VALUE BEING SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER THAN THE COST BASIS OF OUR

INVESTMENT.

IN ADDITION, DURING THE FOURTH

QUARTER OF 2008, WE RECORDED A $176 MILLION IMPAIRMENT

CHARGE ON OUR AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE MARKETABLE INVESTMENT IN THE

NEW CLEARWIRE CORPORATION DUE TO THE FAIR VALUE BEING

SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER THAN THE COST BASIS OF OUR INVESTMENT.

OTHER

NON-MARKETABLE EQUITY INVESTMENTS

WE DETERMINE THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR

OTHER NON-MARKETABLE EQUITY INVESTMENTS USING THE MARKET

APPROACH AND/OR THE INCOME APPROACH. THE MARKET APPROACH

INCLUDES THE USE OF FINANCIAL METRICS AND RATIOS OF COMPARABLE

PUBLIC COMPANIES. THE SELECTION OF COMPARABLE COMPANIES REQUIRES

MANAGEMENT JUDGMENT AND IS BASED ON A NUMBER OF FACTORS,

INCLUDING COMPARABLE COMPANIES SIZES, GROWTH RATES,

PRODUCTS AND SERVICES LINES, DEVELOPMENT STAGE, AND OTHER

RELEVANT FACTORS. THE INCOME APPROACH INCLUDES THE USE OF A

DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW MODEL, WHICH REQUIRES THE FOLLOWING

SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES FOR THE INVESTEE: REVENUE, BASED ON

ASSUMED MARKET SEGMENT SIZE AND ASSUMED MARKET SEGMENT SHARE;

ESTIMATED COSTS; AND APPROPRIATE DISCOUNT RATES BASED ON THE

RISK PROFILE OF COMPARABLE COMPANIES. ESTIMATES OF MARKET

SEGMENT SIZE, MARKET SEGMENT SHARE, AND COSTS ARE DEVELOPED BY

THE INVESTEE

AND/OR

INTEL

USING HISTORICAL DATA AND AVAILABLE MARKET DATA. THE VALUATION

OF OUR OTHER NON-MARKETABLE INVESTMENTS ALSO TAKES INTO ACCOUNT

MOVEMENTS OF THE EQUITY AND VENTURE CAPITAL MARKETS, RECENT

FINANCING ACTIVITIES BY THE INVESTEES, CHANGES IN THE INTEREST

RATE ENVIRONMENT, THE INVESTEES CAPITAL STRUCTURE,

LIQUIDATION PREFERENCES FOR THE INVESTEES CAPITAL, AND

OTHER ECONOMIC VARIABLES. THE VALUATION OF SOME OF OUR

INVESTMENTS IN THE WIRELESS CONNECTIVITY MARKET SEGMENT WAS

BASED ON THE INCOME APPROACH TO DETERMINE THE VALUE OF THE

INVESTEES SPECTRUM LICENSES, TRANSMISSION TOWERS, AND

CUSTOMER LISTS.

WE RECORDED A TOTAL OF

$200 MILLION OF IMPAIRMENT CHARGES IN 2008 ON OUR OTHER

NON-MARKETABLE EQUITY INVESTMENTS. OVER THE PAST 12 QUARTERS,

INCLUDING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2008, IMPAIRMENTS OF OUR OTHER

NON-MARKETABLE EQUITY INVESTMENTS HAVE RANGED FROM

$10 MILLION TO $134 MILLION PER QUARTER.

INVESTMENTS

IN DEBT INSTRUMENTS

FAIR

VALUE

IN THE CURRENT MARKET ENVIRONMENT,

THE ASSESSMENT OF THE FAIR VALUE OF DEBT INSTRUMENTS CAN BE

DIFFICULT AND SUBJECTIVE. THE VOLUME OF TRADING ACTIVITY OF

CERTAIN DEBT INSTRUMENTS HAS DECLINED, AND THE RAPID CHANGES

OCCURRING IN TODAYS FINANCIAL MARKETS CAN LEAD TO CHANGES

IN THE FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS IN RELATIVELY SHORT

PERIODS OF TIME. SFAS NO. 157 ESTABLISHES THREE LEVELS

OF INPUTS THAT MAY BE USED TO MEASURE FAIR VALUE (SEE

NOTE 3: FAIR VALUE IN PART II, ITEM 8

OF THIS

FORM 10-K).

EACH LEVEL OF INPUT HAS DIFFERENT LEVELS OF SUBJECTIVITY AND

DIFFICULTY INVOLVED IN DETERMINING FAIR VALUE.

LEVEL 1 INSTRUMENTS REPRESENT

QUOTED PRICES IN ACTIVE MARKETS. THEREFORE, DETERMINING FAIR

VALUE FOR LEVEL 1 INSTRUMENTS DOES NOT REQUIRE SIGNIFICANT

MANAGEMENT JUDGMENT, AND THE ESTIMATION IS NOT DIFFICULT.

CREDIT RATINGS, NON-BINDING MARKET CONSENSUS PRICES THAT CAN BE

CORROBORATED WITH OBSERVABLE MARKET DATA, MODEL-DERIVED

VALUATIONS IN WHICH ALL SIGNIFICANT INPUTS ARE OBSERVABLE OR CAN

BE DERIVED PRINCIPALLY FROM OR CORROBORATED WITH OBSERVABLE

MARKET DATA FOR SUBSTANTIALLY THE FULL TERM OF THE ASSETS OR

LIABILITIES, OR QUOTED PRICES FOR SIMILAR ASSETS OR LIABILITIES.

THESE LEVEL 2 INSTRUMENTS REQUIRE MORE MANAGEMENT JUDGMENT

AND SUBJECTIVITY COMPARED TO LEVEL 1 INSTRUMENTS, INCLUDING.



DETERMINING WHICH INSTRUMENTS ARE

MOST SIMILAR TO THE INSTRUMENT BEING PRICED REQUIRES MANAGEMENT

TO IDENTIFY A SAMPLE OF SIMILAR SECURITIES BASED ON THE COUPON

RATES, MATURITY, ISSUER, CREDIT RATING, AND INSTRUMENT TYPE, AND

SUBJECTIVELY SELECT AN INDIVIDUAL SECURITY OR MULTIPLE

SECURITIES THAT ARE DEEMED MOST SIMILAR TO THE SECURITY BEING

PRICED.



DETERMINING WHETHER A MARKET IS

CONSIDERED ACTIVE REQUIRES MANAGEMENT JUDGMENT. OUR ASSESSMENT

OF AN ACTIVE MARKET FOR OUR MARKETABLE DEBT INSTRUMENTS

GENERALLY TAKES INTO CONSIDERATION ACTIVITY DURING EACH WEEK OF

THE ONE-MONTH PERIOD PRIOR TO THE VALUATION DATE OF EACH

INDIVIDUAL INSTRUMENT, INCLUDING THE NUMBER OF DAYS EACH

INDIVIDUAL INSTRUMENT TRADES AND THE AVERAGE WEEKLY TRADING

VOLUME IN RELATION TO THE TOTAL OUTSTANDING AMOUNT OF THE ISSUED

INSTRUMENT.



DETERMINING WHICH MODEL-DERIVED

VALUATIONS TO USE IN DETERMINING FAIR VALUE REQUIRES MANAGEMENT

JUDGMENT. WHEN OBSERVABLE MARKET PRICES FOR IDENTICAL SECURITIES

OR SIMILAR SECURITIES ARE NOT AVAILABLE, WE PRICE OUR MARKETABLE

DEBT INSTRUMENTS USING

NON-BINDING

MARKET CONSENSUS PRICES THAT ARE CORROBORATED WITH OBSERVABLE

MARKET DATA OR PRICING MODELS, SUCH AS DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW

MODELS, WITH ALL SIGNIFICANT INPUTS DERIVED FROM OR CORROBORATED

WITH OBSERVABLE MARKET DATA.

LEVEL 3 INSTRUMENTS INCLUDE

UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS TO THE VALUATION METHODOLOGY THAT ARE

SIGNIFICANT TO THE MEASUREMENT OF FAIR VALUE OF ASSETS OR

LIABILITIES. THE DETERMINATION OF FAIR VALUE FOR LEVEL 3

INSTRUMENTS REQUIRES THE MOST MANAGEMENT JUDGMENT AND

SUBJECTIVITY. MOST OF OUR MARKETABLE DEBT INSTRUMENTS CLASSIFIED

AS LEVEL 3 ARE VALUED USING A NON-BINDING MARKET CONSENSUS

PRICE OR A NON-BINDING BROKER QUOTE, BOTH OF WHICH WE

CORROBORATE WITH UNOBSERVABLE DATA. NON-BINDING MARKET CONSENSUS

PRICES ARE BASED ON THE PROPRIETARY VALUATION MODELS OF PRICING

PROVIDERS OR BROKERS. THESE VALUATION MODELS INCORPORATE A

NUMBER OF INPUTS, INCLUDING NON-BINDING AND BINDING BROKER

QUOTES; OBSERVABLE MARKET PRICES FOR IDENTICAL

AND/OR

SIMILAR SECURITIES; AND THE INTERNAL ASSUMPTIONS OF PRICING

PROVIDERS OR BROKERS THAT USE OBSERVABLE MARKET INPUTS, AND TO A

LESSER DEGREE NON-OBSERVABLE MARKET INPUTS. ADJUSTMENTS TO THE

FAIR VALUE OF INSTRUMENTS PRICED USING NON-BINDING MARKET

CONSENSUS PRICES AND NON-BINDING BROKER QUOTES, AND CLASSIFIED

AS LEVEL 3, WERE NOT SIGNIFICANT IN 2008.

OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY

IMPAIRMENT

AFTER DETERMINING THE FAIR VALUE

OF OUR AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE DEBT INSTRUMENTS, GAINS OR LOSSES ON

THESE INVESTMENTS ARE RECORDED TO OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME,

UNTIL EITHER THE INVESTMENT IS SOLD OR WE DETERMINE THAT THE

DECLINE IN VALUE IS OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY. DETERMINING WHETHER

THE DECLINE IN FAIR VALUE IS OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY REQUIRES

MANAGEMENT JUDGMENT BASED ON THE SPECIFIC FACTS AND

CIRCUMSTANCES OF EACH INVESTMENT. FOR INVESTMENTS IN DEBT

INSTRUMENTS, THESE JUDGMENTS PRIMARILY CONSIDER: THE FINANCIAL

CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY OF THE ISSUER, THE ISSUERS CREDIT

RATING, AND ANY SPECIFIC EVENTS THAT MAY CAUSE US TO BELIEVE

THAT THE DEBT INSTRUMENT WILL NOT MATURE AND BE PAID IN FULL;

AND OUR ABILITY AND INTENT TO HOLD THE INVESTMENT TO MATURITY.

GIVEN THE CURRENT MARKET CONDITIONS, THESE JUDGMENTS COULD PROVE

TO BE WRONG, AND COMPANIES WITH RELATIVELY HIGH CREDIT RATINGS

AND SOLID FINANCIAL CONDITIONS MAY NOT BE ABLE TO FULFILL THEIR

OBLIGATIONS. IN ADDITION, IF MANAGEMENT DECIDES NOT TO HOLD AN

INVESTMENT UNTIL MATURITY, IT MAY RESULT IN THE RECOGNITION OF

AN OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENT.

AS OF DECEMBER 27, 2008, OUR

INVESTMENTS INCLUDED $11.3 BILLION OF AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE

DEBT INSTRUMENTS. DURING 2008, WE RECOGNIZED $44 MILLION IN

IMPAIRMENT CHARGES ON OUR AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE DEBT INSTRUMENTS.

AS OF DECEMBER 27, 2008, OUR CUMULATIVE UNREALIZED LOSSES

RELATED TO DEBT INSTRUMENTS CLASSIFIED AS AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE

WERE APPROXIMATELY $215 MILLION (APPROXIMATELY

$55 MILLION AS OF DECEMBER 29, 2007). AS OF

DECEMBER 27, 2008, THIS AMOUNT INCLUDED APPROXIMATELY

$170 MILLION OF UNRECOGNIZED LOSSES THAT COULD BE

RECOGNIZED IN THE FUTURE IF OUR OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY ASSESSMENT

CHANGES.

LONG-LIVED

ASSETS

WE ASSESS THE IMPAIRMENT OF

LONG-LIVED ASSETS WHEN EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES

INDICATE THAT THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE ASSETS OR THE ASSET

GROUPING MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE. FACTORS THAT WE CONSIDER IN

DECIDING WHEN TO PERFORM AN IMPAIRMENT REVIEW INCLUDE

SIGNIFICANT UNDER-PERFORMANCE OF A BUSINESS OR PRODUCT LINE IN

RELATION TO EXPECTATIONS, SIGNIFICANT NEGATIVE INDUSTRY OR

ECONOMIC TRENDS, AND SIGNIFICANT CHANGES OR PLANNED CHANGES IN

OUR USE OF THE ASSETS. WE MEASURE THE RECOVERABILITY OF ASSETS

THAT WILL CONTINUE TO BE USED IN OUR OPERATIONS BY COMPARING THE

CARRYING VALUE OF THE ASSET GROUPING TO OUR ESTIMATE OF THE

RELATED TOTAL FUTURE UNDISCOUNTED NET CASH FLOWS. IF AN ASSET

GROUPINGS CARRYING VALUE IS NOT RECOVERABLE THROUGH THE

RELATED UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS, THE ASSET GROUPING IS

CONSIDERED TO BE IMPAIRED. THE IMPAIRMENT IS MEASURED BY

COMPARING THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE ASSET GROUPINGS

CARRYING VALUE AND ITS FAIR VALUE, BASED ON THE BEST INFORMATION

AVAILABLE, INCLUDING MARKET PRICES OR DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW

ANALYSIS.

IMPAIRMENTS OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS

ARE DETERMINED FOR GROUPS OF ASSETS RELATED TO THE LOWEST LEVEL

OF IDENTIFIABLE INDEPENDENT CASH FLOWS. DUE TO OUR ASSET USAGE

MODEL AND THE INTERCHANGEABLE NATURE OF OUR SEMICONDUCTOR

MANUFACTURING CAPACITY, WE MUST MAKE SUBJECTIVE JUDGMENTS IN

DETERMINING THE INDEPENDENT CASH FLOWS THAT CAN BE RELATED TO

SPECIFIC ASSET GROUPINGS. IN ADDITION, AS WE MAKE MANUFACTURING

PROCESS CONVERSIONS AND OTHER FACTORY PLANNING DECISIONS, WE

MUST MAKE SUBJECTIVE JUDGMENTS REGARDING THE REMAINING USEFUL

LIVES OF ASSETS, PRIMARILY PROCESS-SPECIFIC SEMICONDUCTOR

MANUFACTURING TOOLS AND BUILDING IMPROVEMENTS. WHEN WE DETERMINE

THAT THE USEFUL LIVES OF ASSETS ARE SHORTER THAN WE HAD

ORIGINALLY ESTIMATED, WE ACCELERATE THE RATE OF DEPRECIATION

OVER THE ASSETS NEW, SHORTER USEFUL LIVES. OVER THE PAST

12 QUARTERS, INCLUDING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2008, IMPAIRMENTS

AND ACCELERATED DEPRECIATION OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS RANGED FROM

$1 MILLION TO $320 MILLION PER QUARTER. FOR FURTHER

DISCUSSION ON THESE ASSET IMPAIRMENT CHARGES, SEE

NOTE 15: RESTRUCTURING AND ASSET IMPAIRMENT

CHARGES IN PART II, ITEM 8 OF THIS

FORM 10-K.

LONG-LIVED ASSETS SUCH AS

GOODWILL; INTANGIBLE ASSETS; AND PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT

ARE CONSIDERED NON-FINANCIAL ASSETS, AND ARE MEASURED AT FAIR

VALUE ONLY WHEN INDICATORS OF IMPAIRMENT EXIST. THE ACCOUNTING

AND DISCLOSURE PROVISIONS OF SFAS NO. 157 ARE

EFFECTIVE FOR THESE ASSETS BEGINNING IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF

2009. FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION, SEE NOTE 2: ACCOUNTING

POLICIES IN PART II, ITEM 8 OF THIS

FORM 10-K.

INCOME

TAXES

WE MUST MAKE CERTAIN ESTIMATES AND

JUDGMENTS IN DETERMINING INCOME TAX EXPENSE FOR FINANCIAL

STATEMENT PURPOSES. THESE ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS OCCUR IN THE

CALCULATION OF TAX CREDITS, BENEFITS, AND DEDUCTIONS, AND IN THE

CALCULATION OF CERTAIN TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, WHICH ARISE

FROM DIFFERENCES IN THE TIMING OF RECOGNITION OF REVENUE AND

EXPENSE FOR TAX AND FINANCIAL STATEMENT PURPOSES, AS WELL AS THE

INTEREST AND PENALTIES RELATED TO UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS.

SIGNIFICANT CHANGES TO THESE ESTIMATES MAY RESULT IN AN INCREASE

OR DECREASE TO OUR TAX PROVISION IN A SUBSEQUENT PERIOD.

WE MUST ASSESS THE LIKELIHOOD THAT

WE WILL BE ABLE TO RECOVER OUR DEFERRED TAX ASSETS. IF RECOVERY

IS NOT LIKELY, WE MUST INCREASE OUR PROVISION FOR TAXES BY

RECORDING A VALUATION ALLOWANCE AGAINST THE DEFERRED TAX ASSETS

THAT WE ESTIMATE WILL NOT ULTIMATELY BE RECOVERABLE. WE BELIEVE

THAT WE WILL ULTIMATELY RECOVER A MAJORITY OF THE DEFERRED TAX

ASSETS. HOWEVER, SHOULD THERE BE A CHANGE IN OUR ABILITY TO

RECOVER OUR DEFERRED TAX ASSETS, OUR TAX PROVISION WOULD

INCREASE IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH WE DETERMINED THAT THE RECOVERY

WAS NOT LIKELY. IN 2008, WE RECORDED GROSS ADDITIONAL VALUATION

ALLOWANCES OF APPROXIMATELY $270 MILLION, PRIMARILY RELATED

TO OUR ANTICIPATED INABILITY TO TAKE THE FULL TAX BENEFIT OF

IMPAIRMENT CHARGES. CHANGES IN MANAGEMENTS PLANS WITH

RESPECT TO HOLDING OR DISPOSING OF INVESTMENTS COULD AFFECT OUR

FUTURE PROVISION FOR TAXES.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

MANAGEMENTS

DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)

THE CALCULATION OF OUR TAX

LIABILITIES INVOLVES DEALING WITH UNCERTAINTIES IN THE

APPLICATION OF COMPLEX TAX REGULATIONS. IN ACCORDANCE WITH

FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD (FASB) INTERPRETATION

NO. 48, ACCOUNTING FOR UNCERTAINTY IN INCOME

TAXESAN INTERPRETATION OF SFAS NO. 109,

AND RELATED GUIDANCE, WE RECOGNIZE LIABILITIES FOR UNCERTAIN TAX

POSITIONS BASED ON A TWO-STEP PROCESS. THE FIRST STEP IS TO

EVALUATE THE TAX POSITION FOR RECOGNITION BY DETERMINING IF THE

WEIGHT OF AVAILABLE EVIDENCE INDICATES THAT IT IS MORE LIKELY

THAN NOT THAT THE POSITION WILL BE SUSTAINED ON AUDIT, INCLUDING

RESOLUTION OF RELATED APPEALS OR LITIGATION PROCESSES, IF ANY.

IF WE DETERMINE THAT A TAX POSITION WILL MORE LIKELY THAN NOT BE

SUSTAINED ON AUDIT, THE SECOND STEP REQUIRES US TO ESTIMATE AND

MEASURE THE TAX BENEFIT AS THE LARGEST AMOUNT THAT IS MORE THAN

50% LIKELY TO BE REALIZED UPON ULTIMATE SETTLEMENT. IT IS

INHERENTLY DIFFICULT AND SUBJECTIVE TO ESTIMATE SUCH AMOUNTS, AS

WE HAVE TO DETERMINE THE PROBABILITY OF VARIOUS POSSIBLE

OUTCOMES. WE REEVALUATE THESE UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS ON A

QUARTERLY BASIS. THIS EVALUATION IS BASED ON FACTORS INCLUDING,

BUT NOT LIMITED TO, CHANGES IN FACTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES, CHANGES

IN TAX LAW, SETTLED AND EFFECTIVELY SETTLED ISSUES UNDER AUDIT,

AND NEW AUDIT ACTIVITY. SUCH A CHANGE IN RECOGNITION OR

MEASUREMENT WOULD RESULT IN THE RECOGNITION OF A TAX BENEFIT OR

AN ADDITIONAL CHARGE TO THE TAX PROVISION.

INVENTORY

THE VALUATION OF INVENTORY

REQUIRES US TO ESTIMATE OBSOLETE OR EXCESS INVENTORY AS WELL AS

INVENTORY THAT IS NOT OF SALEABLE QUALITY. THE DETERMINATION OF

OBSOLETE OR EXCESS INVENTORY REQUIRES US TO ESTIMATE THE FUTURE

DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS. THE ESTIMATE OF FUTURE DEMAND IS

COMPARED TO WORK IN PROCESS AND FINISHED GOODS INVENTORY LEVELS

TO DETERMINE THE AMOUNT, IF ANY, OF OBSOLETE OR EXCESS

INVENTORY. AS OF DECEMBER 27, 2008, WE HAD TOTAL

WORK-IN-PROCESS

INVENTORY OF $1,577 MILLION AND TOTAL FINISHED GOODS

INVENTORY OF $1,559 MILLION. THE DEMAND FORECAST IS

INCLUDED IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF OUR SHORT-TERM MANUFACTURING

PLANS TO ENABLE CONSISTENCY BETWEEN INVENTORY VALUATION AND

BUILD DECISIONS. PRODUCT-SPECIFIC FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES

REVIEWED IN THE INVENTORY VALUATION PROCESS INCLUDE A REVIEW OF

THE CUSTOMER BASE, THE STAGE OF THE PRODUCT LIFE CYCLE OF OUR

PRODUCTS, CONSUMER CONFIDENCE, AND CUSTOMER ACCEPTANCE OF OUR

PRODUCTS, AS WELL AS AN ASSESSMENT OF THE SELLING PRICE IN

RELATION TO THE PRODUCT COST. IF OUR DEMAND FORECAST FOR

SPECIFIC PRODUCTS IS GREATER THAN ACTUAL DEMAND AND WE FAIL TO

REDUCE MANUFACTURING OUTPUT ACCORDINGLY, OR IF WE FAIL TO

FORECAST THE DEMAND ACCURATELY, WE COULD BE REQUIRED TO WRITE

OFF INVENTORY, WHICH WOULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR GROSS MARGIN.

BREAKDOWN OF REVENUE

OUR NET REVENUE WAS

$37.6 BILLION IN 2008, A DECREASE OF 2% COMPARED TO 2007.

HIGHER REVENUE FROM THE SALE OF MICROPROCESSORS AND CHIPSETS WAS

MORE THAN OFFSET BY THE IMPACTS OF DIVESTITURES AND LOWER

REVENUE FROM THE SALE OF MOTHERBOARDS. REVENUE FROM THE SALE OF

NOR FLASH MEMORY AND CELLULAR BASEBAND PRODUCTS DECLINED

APPROXIMATELY $1.7 BILLION, PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF

DIVESTITURE OF THESE BUSINESSES. REVENUE IN THE AMERICAS REGION

DECREASED 4% IN 2008 COMPARED TO 2007. REVENUE IN THE

ASIA-PACIFIC, EUROPE, AND JAPAN REGIONS REMAINED APPROXIMATELY

FLAT IN 2008 COMPARED TO 2007.

OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)

ALTHOUGH NET REVENUE FOR 2008

DECLINED ONLY SLIGHTLY FROM 2007, NET REVENUE FOR THE FOURTH

QUARTER OF 2008 DECLINED 19% FROM THE THIRD QUARTER AS CUSTOMERS

REDUCED INVENTORY LEVELS TO KEEP PACE WITH THE DRAMATIC DECLINE

IN END-USER DEMAND THAT OCCURRED OVER THE COURSE OF THE QUARTER.

IT IS UNCLEAR WHEN A TURNAROUND MAY OCCUR, AND THERE REMAINS A

HIGH DEGREE OF UNCERTAINTY AROUND DEMAND, WHICH MAY CONTINUE TO

DECLINE.

OUR OVERALL GROSS MARGIN DOLLARS

FOR 2008 WERE $20.8 BILLION, AN INCREASE OF

$940 MILLION, OR 5%, COMPARED TO 2007. OUR OVERALL GROSS

MARGIN PERCENTAGE INCREASED TO 55.5% IN 2008 FROM 51.9% IN 2007.

THE INCREASE IN GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE WAS PRIMARILY

ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE INCREASE IN THE

DIGITAL ENTERPRISE GROUP OPERATING SEGMENT. IN ADDITION, OUR

GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE INCREASED DUE TO THE DIVESTITURE OF OUR

NOR FLASH MEMORY BUSINESS. WE DERIVED MOST OF OUR OVERALL GROSS

MARGIN DOLLARS AND OPERATING PROFIT IN 2008 AND 2007 FROM THE

SALE OF MICROPROCESSORS IN THE DIGITAL ENTERPRISE GROUP AND

MOBILITY GROUP OPERATING SEGMENTS. SEE BUSINESS

OUTLOOK FOR A DISCUSSION OF GROSS MARGIN EXPECTATIONS.

OUR NET REVENUE WAS

$38.3 BILLION IN 2007, AN INCREASE OF 8% COMPARED TO 2006.

HIGHER MICROPROCESSOR UNIT SALES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER

MICROPROCESSOR AVERAGE SELLING PRICES. HIGHER MOBILE CHIPSET

UNIT SALES ALSO CONTRIBUTED TO THE INCREASE IN NET REVENUE.

LOWER NOR FLASH MEMORY REVENUE IN 2007 COMPARED TO 2006 WAS

MOSTLY OFFSET BY THE RAMP OF OUR NAND FLASH MEMORY BUSINESS. THE

DECREASE IN NOR FLASH MEMORY REVENUE WAS DUE TO A SIGNIFICANT

DECLINE IN AVERAGE SELLING PRICES. LOWER ROYALTY REVENUE WAS

OFFSET BY HIGHER UNIT SALES. REVENUE IN THE ASIA-PACIFIC REGION

INCREASED 11% AND REVENUE IN THE EUROPE REGION INCREASED 10% IN

2007 COMPARED TO 2006, AND REVENUE IN THE AMERICAS REGION AND

JAPAN INCREASED 3% IN 2007 COMPARED TO 2006.

OUR OVERALL GROSS MARGIN DOLLARS

FOR 2007 WERE $19.9 BILLION, AN INCREASE OF

$1.7 BILLION, OR 9%, COMPARED TO 2006. OUR OVERALL GROSS

MARGIN PERCENTAGE WAS RELATIVELY FLAT AT 51.9% IN 2007 COMPARED

TO 51.5% IN 2006. THE GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE INCREASE IN THE

DIGITAL ENTERPRISE GROUP OPERATING SEGMENT WAS MOSTLY OFFSET BY

A DECREASE IN THE GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE IN THE MOBILITY GROUP

OPERATING SEGMENT AND COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE RAMP OF OUR NAND

FLASH MEMORY BUSINESS. WE DERIVED MOST OF OUR OVERALL GROSS

MARGIN DOLLARS AND OPERATING PROFIT IN 2007 AND 2006 FROM THE

SALE OF MICROPROCESSORS IN THE DIGITAL ENTERPRISE GROUP AND

THE DESKTOP AND ENTERPRISE COMPUTING MARKET SEGMENTS AS WELL AS

EMBEDDED MICROPROCESSORS. THE INCREASE IN MICROPROCESSOR REVENUE

WAS DUE TO HIGHER ENTERPRISE MICROPROCESSOR AVERAGE SELLING

PRICES AND HIGHER EMBEDDED MICROPROCESSOR UNIT SALES, PARTIALLY

OFFSET BY LOWER DESKTOP MICROPROCESSOR UNIT SALES. THE DECREASE

IN CHIPSET, MOTHERBOARD, AND OTHER REVENUE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO

LOWER MOTHERBOARD UNIT SALES AND LOWER REVENUE FROM THE SALE OF

COMMUNICATIONS PRODUCTS. IN ADDITION, LOWER CHIPSET AVERAGE

SELLING PRICES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER CHIPSET UNIT

SALES.

OPERATING INCOME INCREASED BY

$1.2 BILLION, OR 22%, IN 2008 COMPARED TO 2007. THE

INCREASE IN OPERATING INCOME WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER DESKTOP

MICROPROCESSOR AND CHIPSET UNIT COSTS. LOWER

START-UP

COSTS OF APPROXIMATELY $350 MILLION AND LOWER OPERATING

EXPENSES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY SALES IN 2007 OF DESKTOP

OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)

FOR 2007, NET REVENUE FOR THE DEG

OPERATING SEGMENT INCREASED BY $619 MILLION, OR 3%,

COMPARED TO 2006. THE INCREASE IN MICROPROCESSOR REVENUE WAS DUE

TO HIGHER MICROPROCESSOR UNIT SALES AND HIGHER ENTERPRISE

AVERAGE SELLING PRICES. THESE INCREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY

LOWER DESKTOP AVERAGE SELLING PRICES IN A COMPETITIVE PRICING

ENVIRONMENT. THE DECREASE IN CHIPSET, MOTHERBOARD, AND OTHER

REVENUE WAS DUE TO LOWER MOTHERBOARD UNIT SALES AS WELL AS A

DECREASE IN COMMUNICATIONS INFRASTRUCTURE REVENUE, WHICH WAS

PRIMARILY DUE TO DIVESTITURES OF CERTAIN COMMUNICATIONS

INFRASTRUCTURE BUSINESSES THAT WERE COMPLETED IN 2006 AND 2007.

PARTIALLY OFFSETTING THESE DECREASES WAS HIGHER CHIPSET REVENUE.

OPERATING INCOME INCREASED BY

$2.0 BILLION, OR 61%, IN 2007 COMPARED TO 2006. THE

INCREASE IN OPERATING INCOME WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER DESKTOP

MICROPROCESSOR UNIT COSTS AND LOWER OPERATING EXPENSES, AND TO A

LESSER EXTENT, SALES OF DESKTOP MICROPROCESSOR INVENTORY THAT

HAD BEEN PREVIOUSLY WRITTEN OFF. PARTIALLY OFFSETTING THESE

INCREASES WERE HIGHER CHIPSET UNIT COSTS AND APPROXIMATELY

$500 MILLION OF HIGHER

START-UP

COSTS, PRIMARILY RELATED TO OUR 45NM PROCESS TECHNOLOGY. IN

SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER MICROPROCESSOR UNIT SALES, WHICH WERE

PARTIALLY OFFSET BY SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER MICROPROCESSOR AVERAGE

SELLING PRICES. A PORTION OF THE INCREASE IN MICROPROCESSOR UNIT

SALES, AS WELL AS A PORTION OF THE DECREASE IN AVERAGE SELLING

PRICES, WAS DUE TO THE RAMP OF INTEL ATOM PROCESSORS. THE

INCREASE IN CHIPSET AND OTHER REVENUE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO

SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER CHIPSET UNIT SALES, WHICH WERE PARTIALLY

OFFSET BY LOWER REVENUE FROM THE SALE OF CELLULAR BASEBAND

PRODUCTS. WE ARE WINDING DOWN THE SALES FROM THE MANUFACTURING

AGREEMENT ENTERED INTO AS PART OF THE DIVESTITURE OF THE

CELLULAR BASEBAND BUSINESS.

OPERATING INCOME DECREASED BY

$412 MILLION, OR 7%, IN 2008 COMPARED TO 2007. THE DECREASE

IN OPERATING INCOME WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER OPERATING

EXPENSES, WHICH WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER MICROPROCESSOR

UNIT COSTS.

FOR 2007, NET REVENUE FOR THE MG

OPERATING SEGMENT INCREASED BY $2.4 BILLION, OR 19%,

COMPARED TO 2006. THE INCREASE IN MICROPROCESSOR REVENUE WAS DUE

TO A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN UNIT SALES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY

SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER AVERAGE SELLING PRICES. THE INCREASE IN

CHIPSET AND OTHER REVENUE WAS DUE TO HIGHER UNIT SALES OF

CHIPSETS AND, TO A LESSER EXTENT, HIGHER REVENUE FROM SALES OF

CELLULAR BASEBAND PRODUCTS. IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2006, WE

SOLD CERTAIN ASSETS OF THE BUSINESS LINE THAT INCLUDED

APPLICATION AND CELLULAR BASEBAND PROCESSORS USED IN HANDHELD

DEVICES; HOWEVER, IN 2007 WE CONTINUED TO MANUFACTURE AND SELL

THOSE PRODUCTS AS PART OF A MANUFACTURING AND TRANSITION

SERVICES AGREEMENT.

OPERATING INCOME INCREASED BY

$1.0 BILLION, OR 22%, IN 2007 COMPARED TO 2006. THE

INCREASE IN OPERATING INCOME WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER

REVENUE. LOWER MICROPROCESSOR UNIT COSTS WERE MORE THAN OFFSET

BY APPROXIMATELY $330 MILLION OF HIGHER

START-UP

COSTS, PRIMARILY RELATED TO OUR 45NM PROCESS TECHNOLOGY. LOWER

UNIT COSTS ON WIRELESS CONNECTIVITY AND CELLULAR BASEBAND

PRODUCTS WERE OFFSET BY HIGHER CHIPSET UNIT COSTS. OPERATING

EXPENSES WERE HIGHER IN 2007 COMPARED TO 2006; HOWEVER,

OPERATING EXPENSES AS A PERCENTAGE OF REVENUE DECREASED IN 2007

START-UP

COSTS RELATED TO OUR 45NM PROCESS TECHNOLOGY TO RESEARCH AND

DEVELOPMENT OF OUR NEXT-GENERATION 32NM PROCESS TECHNOLOGY. THE

DECREASE IN 2007 COMPARED TO 2006 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER

ADDITIONAL RESTRUCTURING AND ASSET IMPAIRMENT CHARGES OF

$160 MILLION.

2008 NAND

PLAN

IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2008,

MANAGEMENT APPROVED A PLAN WITH MICRON TO DISCONTINUE THE SUPPLY

OF NAND FLASH MEMORY FROM THE 200MM FACILITY WITHIN THE IMFT

MANUFACTURING NETWORK. THE AGREEMENT RESULTED IN A

$215 MILLION RESTRUCTURING CHARGE, PRIMARILY RELATED TO THE

IMFT 200MM SUPPLY AGREEMENT. THE RESTRUCTURING CHARGE RESULTED

IN A REDUCTION OF OUR INVESTMENT IN IMFT OF $184 MILLION, A

CASH PAYMENT TO MICRON OF $24 MILLION, AND OTHER CASH

PAYMENTS OF $7 MILLION.

IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2006,

MANAGEMENT APPROVED SEVERAL ACTIONS RECOMMENDED BY OUR STRUCTURE

AND EFFICIENCY TASK FORCE AS PART OF A RESTRUCTURING PLAN

DESIGNED TO IMPROVE OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCY AND FINANCIAL

RESULTS. SOME OF THESE ACTIVITIES HAVE INVOLVED COST SAVINGS OR

OTHER ACTIONS THAT DID NOT RESULT IN RESTRUCTURING CHARGES, SUCH

AS BETTER UTILIZATION OF ASSETS, REDUCED SPENDING, AND

ORGANIZATIONAL EFFICIENCIES. THE EFFICIENCY PROGRAM HAS INCLUDED

TARGETED HEADCOUNT REDUCTIONS FOR VARIOUS GROUPS WITHIN THE

COMPANY, WHICH WE HAVE MET THROUGH EMPLOYEE ATTRITION AND

TERMINATIONS. BUSINESS DIVESTURES HAVE FURTHER REDUCED HEADCOUNT.

DURING 2006, WE COMPLETED THE

DIVESTITURE OF THREE BUSINESSES. FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION, SEE

NOTE 12: DIVESTITURES IN PART II,

ITEM 8 OF THIS

FORM 10-K.

IN CONNECTION WITH THE DIVESTITURE OF CERTAIN ASSETS OF OUR

COMMUNICATIONS AND APPLICATION PROCESSOR BUSINESS, WE RECORDED

IMPAIRMENT CHARGES OF $103 MILLION RELATED TO THE

WRITE-DOWN OF MANUFACTURING TOOLS TO THEIR FAIR VALUE, LESS THE

COST TO DISPOSE OF THE ASSETS. WE DETERMINED THE FAIR VALUE

USING A MARKET-BASED VALUATION TECHNIQUE. IN ADDITION, AS A

RESULT OF BOTH THIS DIVESTITURE AND A SUBSEQUENT ASSESSMENT OF

OUR WORLDWIDE MANUFACTURING CAPACITY OPERATIONS, WE PLACED FOR

SALE OUR FABRICATION FACILITY IN COLORADO SPRINGS, COLORADO.

THIS PLAN RESULTED IN AN IMPAIRMENT CHARGE OF $214 MILLION

TO WRITE DOWN TO FAIR VALUE THE LAND, BUILDING, AND EQUIPMENT

ASSET GROUPING THAT HAS BEEN PRINCIPALLY USED TO SUPPORT OUR

COMMUNICATIONS AND APPLICATION PROCESSOR BUSINESS. WE DETERMINED

THE FAIR MARKET VALUE OF THE ASSET GROUPING USING AN AVERAGE OF

THE RESULTS FROM USING THE COST APPROACH AND MARKET APPROACH

VALUATION TECHNIQUES.

DURING 2007, WE INCURRED AN

ADDITIONAL $54 MILLION IN ASSET IMPAIRMENT CHARGES AS A

RESULT OF MARKET CONDITIONS RELATED TO THE COLORADO SPRINGS

FACILITY. ALSO, WE RECORDED LAND AND BUILDING WRITE-DOWNS

RELATED TO CERTAIN FACILITIES IN SANTA CLARA, CALIFORNIA.

IN ADDITION, WE INCURRED $85 MILLION IN ASSET IMPAIRMENT

CHARGES RELATED TO ASSETS THAT WE SOLD IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE

DIVESTITURE OF OUR NOR FLASH MEMORY BUSINESS. WE DETERMINED THE

IMPAIRMENT CHARGES BASED ON THE FAIR VALUE, LESS SELLING COSTS,

THAT WE EXPECTED TO RECEIVE UPON COMPLETION OF THE DIVESTITURE.

DURING 2008, WE INCURRED

ADDITIONAL ASSET IMPAIRMENT CHARGES RELATED TO THE COLORADO

SPRINGS FACILITY, BASED ON MARKET CONDITIONS. ALSO, WE INCURRED

$275 MILLION IN ADDITIONAL ASSET IMPAIRMENT CHARGES RELATED

TO ASSETS THAT WE SOLD IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE DIVESTITURE OF

OUR NOR FLASH MEMORY BUSINESS. WE DETERMINED THE IMPAIRMENT

CHARGES USING THE REVISED FAIR VALUE OF THE EQUITY AND NOTE

RECEIVABLE THAT WE RECEIVED UPON COMPLETION OF THE DIVESTITURE,

LESS SELLING COSTS. THE LOWER FAIR VALUE WAS PRIMARILY A RESULT

OF A DECLINE IN THE OUTLOOK FOR THE FLASH MEMORY MARKET SEGMENT.

WE RECORDED THE ADDITIONAL

ACCRUALS, NET OF ADJUSTMENTS, AS RESTRUCTURING AND ASSET

IMPAIRMENT CHARGES. THE REMAINING ACCRUAL AS OF

DECEMBER 27, 2008 WAS RELATED TO SEVERANCE BENEFITS THAT WE

RECORDED WITHIN ACCRUED COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS.

FROM THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2006

THROUGH THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2008, WE INCURRED A TOTAL OF

$1.6 BILLION IN RESTRUCTURING AND ASSET IMPAIRMENT CHARGES

RELATED TO THIS PROGRAM. THESE CHARGES INCLUDED A TOTAL OF

$678 MILLION RELATED TO EMPLOYEE SEVERANCE AND BENEFIT

ARRANGEMENTS FOR APPROXIMATELY 11,900 EMPLOYEES, OF WHICH

10,800 EMPLOYEES HAD LEFT THE COMPANY AS OF

DECEMBER 27, 2008. A SUBSTANTIAL MAJORITY OF THESE EMPLOYEE

TERMINATIONS AFFECTED EMPLOYEES WITHIN MANUFACTURING,

INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY, AND MARKETING. OF THE EMPLOYEE SEVERANCE

AND BENEFIT CHARGES INCURRED AS OF DECEMBER 27, 2008, WE

HAD PAID $621 MILLION. THE RESTRUCTURING AND ASSET

IMPAIRMENT CHARGES ALSO INCLUDED $888 MILLION IN ASSET

IMPAIRMENT CHARGES.

WE ESTIMATE THAT EMPLOYEE

SEVERANCE AND BENEFIT CHARGES FROM THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2006 TO

THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2008 WILL RESULT IN GROSS ANNUAL SAVINGS

OF APPROXIMATELY $1.1 BILLION, A PORTION OF WHICH WE BEGAN

TO REALIZE IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2006. WE ARE REALIZING THESE

SAVINGS WITHIN MARKETING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES;

COST OF SALES; AND R&D.

SHARE-BASED

COMPENSATION

SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION TOTALED

$851 MILLION IN 2008, $952 MILLION IN 2007, AND

$1.4 BILLION IN 2006. SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION WAS INCLUDED

IN COST OF SALES AND OPERATING EXPENSES. THE DECREASE IN

SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION FROM 2006 TO 2007 WAS A RESULT OF FEWER

EQUITY AWARDS VESTING IN 2007 COMPARED TO 2006.

AS OF DECEMBER 27, 2008,

CHARGES AND HIGHER EQUITY METHOD LOSSES IN 2008 COMPARED TO

2007. IMPAIRMENT CHARGES IN 2008 INCLUDED A $762 MILLION

IMPAIRMENT CHARGE RECOGNIZED ON OUR INVESTMENT IN CLEARWIRE LLC

AND A $250 MILLION IMPAIRMENT CHARGE RECOGNIZED ON OUR

INVESTMENT IN NUMONYX. WE RECOGNIZED THE IMPAIRMENT CHARGE ON

OUR INVESTMENT IN CLEARWIRE LLC TO WRITE DOWN OUR INVESTMENT TO

ITS FAIR VALUE, PRIMARILY DUE TO THE FAIR VALUE BEING

SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER THAN THE COST BASIS OF OUR INVESTMENT. THE

IMPAIRMENT CHARGE ON OUR INVESTMENT IN NUMONYX WAS DUE TO A

GENERAL DECLINE IN THE NOR FLASH MEMORY MARKET SEGMENT. OUR

EQUITY METHOD LOSSES WERE PRIMARILY RELATED TO NUMONYX

($87 MILLION IN 2008) AND THE OLD CLEARWIRE

CORPORATION ($184 MILLION 2008 AND $104 MILLION IN

2007). SEE NOTE 6: EQUITY METHOD AND COST METHOD

INVESTMENTS IN PART II, ITEM 8 OF THIS

FORM 10-K.

NET GAINS ON EQUITY METHOD

INVESTMENTS WERE FLAT IN 2007 COMPARED TO 2006. APPROXIMATELY

$110 MILLION OF INCOME RECOGNIZED IN 2007 DUE TO THE

REORGANIZATION OF ONE OF OUR INVESTMENTS WAS OFFSET BY HIGHER

EQUITY METHOD LOSSES, PRIMARILY FROM OUR INVESTMENT IN THE OLD

CLEARWIRE CORPORATION. EQUITY METHOD LOSSES WERE NOT SIGNIFICANT

IN 2006.

CHARGES IN 2008 INCLUDED A $176 MILLION IMPAIRMENT CHARGE

RECOGNIZED ON OUR INVESTMENT IN THE NEW CLEARWIRE CORPORATION

AND $97 MILLION OF IMPAIRMENT CHARGES ON OUR INVESTMENT IN

MICRON. THE IMPAIRMENT CHARGE ON OUR INVESTMENT IN THE NEW

CLEARWIRE CORPORATION WAS DUE TO THE FAIR VALUE BEING

SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER THAN THE COST BASIS OF OUR INVESTMENT. THE

IMPAIRMENT CHARGES ON OUR INVESTMENT IN MICRON REFLECT THE

DIFFERENCE BETWEEN OUR COST BASIS AND THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR

INVESTMENT IN MICRON AT THE END OF THE SECOND AND THIRD QUARTERS

OF 2008, AND WERE PRINCIPALLY BASED ON OUR ASSESSMENT OF

MICRONS FINANCIAL RESULTS AND THE COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT.

NET GAINS ON OTHER EQUITY

INVESTMENTS WERE $154 MILLION IN 2007 COMPARED TO $212 MILLION

IN 2006. DURING 2007, WE RECOGNIZED LOWER GAINS ON THIRD-PARTY

MERGER TRANSACTIONS AND HIGHER IMPAIRMENT CHARGES, PARTIALLY

OFFSET BY HIGHER GAINS ON SALES OF EQUITY INVESTMENTS. NET GAINS

ON EQUITY INVESTMENTS IN 2006 INCLUDED A GAIN OF $103 MILLION ON

THAT WE EXPERIENCED IN 2008 ON OUR TRADING ASSETS. INTEREST

INCOME WAS LOWER IN 2008 COMPARED TO 2007 AS A RESULT OF LOWER

INTEREST RATES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER AVERAGE INVESTMENT

BALANCES.

INTEREST AND OTHER, NET DECREASED

TO $793 MILLION IN 2007 COMPARED TO $1.2 BILLION IN 2006,

PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER DIVESTITURE GAINS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY

HIGHER INTEREST INCOME RESULTING PRIMARILY FROM HIGHER AVERAGE

INVESTMENT BALANCES, AND TO A LESSER EXTENT HIGHER INTEREST

RATES. RESULTS FOR 2006 INCLUDED NET GAINS OF $612 MILLION FOR

THREE DIVESTITURES. SEE NOTE 12: DIVESTITURES IN

PROVISION

FOR TAXES

OUR EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE WAS

31.1% IN 2008 (23.9% IN 2007 AND 28.6% IN 2006). THE RATE

INCREASED IN 2008 COMPARED TO 2007, PRIMARILY DUE TO THE

RECOGNITION OF A VALUATION ALLOWANCE ON OUR DEFERRED TAX ASSETS

DUE TO THE UNCERTAINTY OF REALIZING TAX BENEFITS RELATED TO

IMPAIRMENTS OF OUR EQUITY INVESTMENTS. IN ADDITION, THE RATE

INCREASED IN 2008 COMPARED TO 2007, DUE TO THE REVERSAL OF

PREVIOUSLY ACCRUED TAXES OF $481 MILLION (INCLUDING $50 MILLION

OF ACCRUED INTEREST) RELATED TO SETTLEMENTS WITH THE U.S.

INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE (IRS) IN THE FIRST AND SECOND QUARTERS

OF 2007. OUR EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE WAS LOWER IN 2007

COMPARED TO 2006, PRIMARILY DUE TO THE SETTLEMENTS WITH THE IRS.

CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING

ACTIVITIES IS NET INCOME ADJUSTED FOR CERTAIN NON-CASH ITEMS AND

CHANGES IN CERTAIN ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. FOR 2008 COMPARED TO

2007, THE $1.7 BILLION DECREASE IN CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING

ACTIVITIES WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE $1.7 BILLION DECREASE IN NET

INCOME, WHILE TOTAL ADJUSTMENTS TO RECONCILE NET INCOME TO CASH

PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES, INCLUDING NET CHANGES IN

ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, WERE APPROXIMATELY FLAT.

INVENTORIES AS OF DECEMBER 27,

2008 INCREASED COMPARED TO DECEMBER 29, 2007, DUE TO HIGHER

CHIPSET AND MICROPROCESSOR INVENTORIES PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER

INVENTORIES OF OTHER PRODUCTS. AS OF DECEMBER 27, 2008, OUR

OTHER ACCRUED LIABILITIES INCLUDED $447 MILLION IN CUSTOMER

CREDIT BALANCES, WHICH WERE RECLASSIFIED FROM ACCOUNTS

RECEIVABLE. ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AS OF DECEMBER 27, 2008

DECREASED SIGNIFICANTLY COMPARED TO DECEMBER 29, 2007, DUE TO A

SIGNIFICANT DECLINE IN REVENUE DURING THE LAST MONTH IN THE

FOURTH QUARTER OF 2008. CUSTOMER CREDIT BALANCES WERE NOT

SIGNIFICANT AS OF DECEMBER 29, 2007. FOR 2008, OUR TWO LARGEST

CUSTOMERS ACCOUNTED FOR 38% OF OUR NET REVENUE (35% IN 2007). IN

2008, ONE OF THESE CUSTOMERS ACCOUNTED FOR 20% OF OUR NET

REVENUE (17% IN 2007), AND ANOTHER CUSTOMER ACCOUNTED FOR 18% OF

OUR NET REVENUE (18% IN 2007). ADDITIONALLY, THESE TWO LARGEST

CUSTOMERS ACCOUNTED FOR 46% OF OUR ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AS OF

DECEMBER 27, 2008 (35% AS OF DECEMBER 29, 2007).

DUE TO THE ADOPTION OF SFAS NO.

159, THE FAIR VALUE OPTION FOR FINANCIAL ASSETS AND

FINANCIAL LIABILITIESINCLUDING AN AMENDMENT OF FASB

STATEMENT NO. 115 (SFAS NO. 159), IN 2008, THE RELATED

CASH FLOWS FOR MARKETABLE DEBT INSTRUMENTS CLASSIFIED AS TRADING

ASSETS ARE NOW INCLUDED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES.

FOR 2007 COMPARED TO 2006, THE

INCREASE IN CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES WAS PRIMARILY

DUE TO HIGHER NET INCOME. CHANGES TO WORKING CAPITAL IN 2007

FROM 2006 WERE APPROXIMATELY FLAT, WITH A DECREASE IN INVENTORY

LEVELS COMPARED TO AN INCREASE IN 2006, OFFSET BY HIGHER

PURCHASES OF TRADING ASSETS EXCEEDING MATURITIES.

INVESTING

ACTIVITIES

INVESTING CASH FLOWS CONSIST

PRIMARILY OF CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, NET INVESTMENT PURCHASES,

MATURITIES, AND DISPOSALS.

THE DECREASE IN CASH USED FOR

INVESTING ACTIVITIES IN 2008 COMPARED TO 2007 WAS PRIMARILY DUE

TO A DECREASE IN PURCHASES OF AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE DEBT

INVESTMENTS. IN ADDITION, DUE TO THE ADOPTION OF SFAS NO. 159 IN

2008, THE RELATED CASH FLOWS FOR MARKETABLE DEBT INSTRUMENTS

CLASSIFIED AS TRADING ASSETS WERE INCLUDED IN INVESTING

ACTIVITIES FOR 2008, AND PREVIOUSLY THEY HAD BEEN INCLUDED IN

OPERATING ACTIVITIES. OUR INVESTMENTS IN NON-MARKETABLE EQUITY

INVESTMENTS WERE HIGHER IN 2008 AND INCLUDED $1.0 BILLION FOR AN

OWNERSHIP INTEREST IN CLEARWIRE LLC.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

MANAGEMENTS

DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)

OUR CAPITAL EXPENDITURES WERE $5.2

BILLION IN 2008 ($5.0 BILLION IN 2007 AND $5.9 BILLION IN 2006).

CAPITAL EXPENDITURES FOR FISCAL YEAR 2009 ARE CURRENTLY EXPECTED

TO BE FLAT TO SLIGHTLY DOWN FROM OUR 2008 EXPENDITURES. CAPITAL

EXPENDITURES DURING FISCAL YEAR 2009 ARE EXPECTED TO BE FUNDED

BY CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES.

THE INCREASE IN CASH USED IN

INVESTING ACTIVITIES IN 2007 COMPARED TO 2006 WAS PRIMARILY DUE

TO HIGHER PURCHASES OF AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE INVESTMENTS. LOWER

CAPITAL SPENDING WAS MOSTLY OFFSET BY LOWER PROCEEDS FROM

DIVESTITURES.

FINANCING

ACTIVITIES

FINANCING CASH FLOWS CONSIST

PRIMARILY OF REPURCHASES AND RETIREMENT OF COMMON STOCK, PAYMENT

OF DIVIDENDS TO STOCKHOLDERS, AND PROCEEDS FROM THE SALE OF

SHARES THROUGH EMPLOYEE EQUITY INCENTIVE PLANS.

THE HIGHER CASH USED IN FINANCING

ACTIVITIES IN 2008 COMPARED TO 2007 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO AN

INCREASE IN REPURCHASES AND RETIREMENT OF COMMON STOCK, AND

LOWER PROCEEDS FROM THE SALE OF SHARES PURSUANT TO EMPLOYEE

EQUITY INCENTIVE PLANS. DURING 2008, WE REPURCHASED $7.2 BILLION

OF COMMON STOCK COMPARED TO $2.8 BILLION IN 2007. AS OF DECEMBER

27, 2008, $7.4 BILLION REMAINED AVAILABLE FOR REPURCHASE UNDER

THE EXISTING REPURCHASE AUTHORIZATION OF $25 BILLION. WE BASE

OUR LEVEL OF COMMON STOCK REPURCHASES ON INTERNAL CASH

MANAGEMENT DECISIONS, AND THIS LEVEL MAY FLUCTUATE. PROCEEDS

FROM THE SALE OF SHARES THROUGH EMPLOYEE EQUITY INCENTIVE PLANS

TOTALED $1.1 BILLION IN 2008 COMPARED TO $3.1 BILLION IN 2007,

AS A RESULT OF A LOWER VOLUME OF EMPLOYEE EXERCISES OF STOCK

OPTIONS. OUR DIVIDEND PAYMENT WAS $3.1 BILLION IN 2008, HIGHER

THAN THE $2.6 BILLION IN 2007, DUE TO INCREASES IN QUARTERLY

CASH DIVIDENDS PER COMMON SHARE. ON JANUARY 23, 2009, OUR BOARD

OF DIRECTORS DECLARED A CASH DIVIDEND OF $0.14 PER COMMON SHARE

FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2009.

THE LOWER CASH USED IN FINANCING

ACTIVITIES IN 2007 COMPARED TO 2006 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO AN

INCREASE IN PROCEEDS FROM THE SALE OF SHARES THROUGH EMPLOYEE

EQUITY INCENTIVE PLANS AND A DECREASE IN REPURCHASES AND

RETIREMENT OF COMMON STOCK.

LIQUIDITY

CASH GENERATED BY OPERATIONS IS

USED AS OUR PRIMARY SOURCE OF LIQUIDITY. AS OF DECEMBER 27,

2008, WE ALSO HAD AN INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO VALUED AT $14.5

BILLION, CONSISTING OF CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS AND MARKETABLE

DEBT INSTRUMENTS INCLUDED IN TRADING ASSETS AND SHORT- AND

LONG-TERM INVESTMENTS.

OUR INVESTMENT POLICY REQUIRES ALL

INVESTMENTS WITH ORIGINAL MATURITIES OF UP TO 6 MONTHS TO BE

RATED AT LEAST

A-1/P-1

BY

STANDARD & POORS/MOODYS, AND SPECIFIES A HIGHER

MINIMUM RATING FOR INVESTMENTS WITH LONGER MATURITIES. FOR

INSTANCE, INVESTMENTS WITH MATURITIES OF GREATER THAN THREE

YEARS REQUIRE A MINIMUM RATING OF AA-/AA3 AT THE TIME OF

INVESTMENT. GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS IMPOSED ON INVESTMENT

ALTERNATIVES OF OUR

NON-U.S.

SUBSIDIARIES, OR THE ABSENCE OF A RATED COUNTERPARTIES IN

CERTAIN COUNTRIES, RESULT IN SOME MINOR EXCEPTIONS.

SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR INVESTMENTS IN DEBT INSTRUMENTS ARE

WITH A/A2 OR BETTER RATED ISSUERS, AND THE MAJORITY OF THE

ISSUERS ARE RATED

AA-/AA2 OR BETTER. ADDITIONALLY, WE LIMIT THE AMOUNT OF CREDIT

EXPOSURE TO ANY ONE COUNTERPARTY BASED ON OUR ANALYSIS OF THAT

COUNTERPARTYS RELATIVE CREDIT STANDING. AS OF DECEMBER 27,

2008, THE TOTAL CREDIT EXPOSURE TO ANY SINGLE COUNTERPARTY DID

NOT EXCEED $500 MILLION.

CREDIT RATING CRITERIA FOR

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS ARE SIMILAR TO THOSE FOR OTHER

INVESTMENTS. THE AMOUNTS SUBJECT TO CREDIT RISK RELATED TO

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS ARE GENERALLY LIMITED TO THE AMOUNTS, IF

ANY, BY WHICH A COUNTERPARTYS OBLIGATIONS EXCEED OUR

OBLIGATIONS WITH THAT COUNTERPARTY, BECAUSE WE ENTER INTO MASTER

NETTING ARRANGEMENTS WITH COUNTERPARTIES WHEN POSSIBLE TO

MITIGATE CREDIT RISK IN DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS SUBJECT TO

INTERNATIONAL SWAPS AND DERIVATIVES ASSOCIATION, INC. (ISDA)

AGREEMENTS.

THE CREDIT QUALITY OF OUR

INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO REMAINS HIGH DURING THIS DIFFICULT CREDIT

ENVIRONMENT, WITH OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENTS ON OUR

AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE DEBT INSTRUMENTS LIMITED TO $44 MILLION

DURING 2008. IN ADDITION, WE CONTINUE TO BE ABLE TO INVEST IN

HIGH-QUALITY INVESTMENTS. HOWEVER, WE HAVE SEEN A REDUCTION IN

THE VOLUME OF AVAILABLE COMMERCIAL PAPER FROM CERTAIN MARKET

SEGMENTS. AS A RESULT, OUR INVESTMENTS IN SHORT-TERM GOVERNMENT

FUNDS HAVE INCREASED, WHICH WILL REDUCE OUR AVERAGE INVESTMENT

RETURN. WITH THE EXCEPTION OF A LIMITED AMOUNT OF INVESTMENTS

FOR WHICH WE HAVE RECOGNIZED OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENTS,

WE HAVE NOT SEEN SIGNIFICANT LIQUIDATION DELAYS, AND FOR THOSE

THAT HAVE MATURED WE HAVE RECEIVED THE FULL PAR VALUE OF OUR

ORIGINAL DEBT INVESTMENTS. WE HAVE THE INTENT AND ABILITY TO

HOLD OUR DEBT INVESTMENTS THAT HAVE UNREALIZED LOSSES IN

ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME FOR A SUFFICIENT PERIOD

OF TIME TO ALLOW FOR RECOVERY OF THE PRINCIPAL AMOUNTS INVESTED,

WHICH MAY OCCUR AT OR NEAR THE MATURITY OF THOSE INVESTMENTS.

DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)

AS OF DECEMBER 27, 2008, $10.2

BILLION OF OUR PORTFOLIO HAD A REMAINING MATURITY OF LESS THAN

ONE YEAR. AS OF DECEMBER 27, 2008, OUR CUMULATIVE UNREALIZED

LOSSES, NET OF CORRESPONDING HEDGING ACTIVITIES, RELATED TO DEBT

INSTRUMENTS CLASSIFIED AS TRADING ASSETS WERE APPROXIMATELY $145

MILLION (APPROXIMATELY $25 MILLION AS OF DECEMBER 29, 2007). AS

OF DECEMBER 27, 2008, OUR CUMULATIVE UNREALIZED LOSSES RELATED

TO DEBT INSTRUMENTS CLASSIFIED AS AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE WERE

APPROXIMATELY $215 MILLION (APPROXIMATELY $55 MILLION AS OF

DECEMBER 29, 2007). SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR UNREALIZED LOSSES

CAN BE ATTRIBUTED TO FAIR VALUE FLUCTUATIONS IN AN UNSTABLE

CREDIT ENVIRONMENT THAT RESULTED IN A DECREASE IN THE MARKET

LIQUIDITY FOR DEBT INSTRUMENTS.

OUR PORTFOLIO INCLUDED $1.1

BILLION OF ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES AS OF DECEMBER 27, 2008.

APPROXIMATELY HALF OF THESE SECURITIES WERE COLLATERALIZED BY

FIRST-LIEN MORTGAGES OR CREDIT CARD DEBT. THE REMAINING

ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES WERE COLLATERALIZED BY STUDENT LOANS OR

AUTO LOANS. DURING 2008, OUR ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES EXPERIENCED

NET UNREALIZED FAIR VALUE DECLINES TOTALING $131 MILLION, OF

WHICH $108 MILLION WAS RECOGNIZED IN OUR CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS

OF INCOME. AS OF DECEMBER 27, 2008, THE EXPECTED WEIGHTED

AVERAGE REMAINING MATURITY WAS LESS THAN TWO YEARS.

WE CONTINUALLY MONITOR THE CREDIT

RISK IN OUR PORTFOLIO AND MITIGATE OUR CREDIT AND INTEREST RATE

EXPOSURES IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE POLICIES APPROVED BY OUR BOARD

OF DIRECTORS. WE INTEND TO CONTINUE TO CLOSELY MONITOR FUTURE

DEVELOPMENTS IN THE CREDIT MARKETS AND MAKE APPROPRIATE CHANGES

TO OUR INVESTMENT POLICY AS DEEMED NECESSARY. BASED ON OUR

ABILITY TO LIQUIDATE OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO AND OUR EXPECTED

OPERATING CASH FLOWS, WE DO NOT ANTICIPATE ANY LIQUIDITY

CONSTRAINTS AS A RESULT OF EITHER THE CURRENT CREDIT ENVIRONMENT

OR POTENTIAL INVESTMENT FAIR VALUE FLUCTUATIONS.

OUR COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAM

PROVIDES ANOTHER POTENTIAL SOURCE OF LIQUIDITY. WE HAVE AN

ONGOING AUTHORIZATION FROM OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS TO BORROW UP

TO $3.0 BILLION, INCLUDING THROUGH THE ISSUANCE OF COMMERCIAL

PAPER. MAXIMUM BORROWINGS UNDER OUR COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAM

DURING 2008 WERE APPROXIMATELY $1.3 BILLION, ALTHOUGH NO

COMMERCIAL PAPER REMAINED OUTSTANDING AS OF DECEMBER 27, 2008.

OUR COMMERCIAL PAPER WAS RATED

A-1+

BY

STANDARD & POORS AND

P-1

BY

MOODYS AS OF DECEMBER 27, 2008. DESPITE THE TIGHTENING OF

THE CREDIT MARKETS, WE CONTINUE TO BE ABLE TO ACCESS FUNDS

THROUGH THE CREDIT MARKETS, INCLUDING THROUGH THE ISSUANCE OF

COMMERCIAL PAPER. WE ALSO HAVE AN AUTOMATIC SHELF REGISTRATION

STATEMENT ON FILE WITH THE SEC PURSUANT TO WHICH WE MAY OFFER AN

UNSPECIFIED AMOUNT OF DEBT, EQUITY, AND OTHER SECURITIES.

WE BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE THE

FINANCIAL RESOURCES NEEDED TO MEET BUSINESS REQUIREMENTS FOR THE

NEXT 12 MONTHS, INCLUDING CAPITAL EXPENDITURES FOR THE EXPANSION

OR UPGRADING OF WORLDWIDE MANUFACTURING AND ASSEMBLY AND TEST

CAPACITY, WORKING CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS, AND POTENTIAL DIVIDENDS,

COMMON STOCK REPURCHASES, AND ACQUISITIONS OR STRATEGIC

INVESTMENTS.

FAIR

VALUE

BEGINNING IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF

2008, THE ASSESSMENT OF FAIR VALUE FOR OUR FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

WAS BASED ON THE PROVISIONS OF SFAS NO. 157. SFAS NO. 157

ESTABLISHES A FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY THAT REQUIRES AN ENTITY TO

MAXIMIZE THE USE OF OBSERVABLE INPUTS AND MINIMIZE THE USE OF

UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS WHEN MEASURING FAIR VALUE. OBSERVABLE INPUTS

ARE OBTAINED FROM INDEPENDENT SOURCES AND CAN BE VALIDATED BY A

THIRD PARTY, WHEREAS UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS REFLECT ASSUMPTIONS

REGARDING WHAT A THIRD PARTY WOULD USE IN PRICING AN ASSET OR

LIABILITY. A FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CATEGORIZATION WITHIN

THE FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY IS BASED ON THE LOWEST LEVEL OF INPUT

THAT IS SIGNIFICANT TO THE FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT.

CREDIT RISK IS FACTORED INTO THE

VALUATION OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS THAT WE MEASURE AT FAIR VALUE

ON A RECURRING BASIS. WHEN FAIR VALUE IS DETERMINED USING

OBSERVABLE MARKET PRICES, THE CREDIT RISK IS INCORPORATED INTO

THE MARKET PRICE OF THE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT. WHEN FAIR VALUE IS

DETERMINED USING PRICING MODELS, SUCH AS A DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW

MODEL, THE ISSUERS CREDIT RISK

AND/OR

INTELS CREDIT RISK IS FACTORED INTO THE CALCULATION OF THE

FAIR VALUE, AS APPROPRIATE. DURING 2008, THE VALUATION OF OUR

LIABILITIES MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE AS WELL AS OUR DERIVATIVE

INSTRUMENTS IN A CURRENT OR POTENTIAL NET LIABILITY POSITION

WERE NOT IMPACTED BY CHANGES IN OUR CREDIT RISK. THE CREDIT

RATINGS OF CERTAIN OF OUR COUNTERPARTIES HAVE DETERIORATED.

HOWEVER, THE DETERIORATION OF THESE CREDIT RATINGS DID NOT HAVE

A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE VALUATION OF EITHER OUR MARKETABLE

DEBT INSTRUMENTS OR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS IN A CURRENT OR

POTENTIAL NET ASSET POSITION.

DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)

WHEN VALUES ARE DETERMINED USING

INPUTS THAT ARE BOTH UNOBSERVABLE AND SIGNIFICANT TO THE VALUES

OF THE INSTRUMENTS BEING MEASURED, WE CLASSIFY THOSE INSTRUMENTS

AS LEVEL 3 UNDER THE SFAS NO. 157 HIERARCHY. AS OF DECEMBER 27,

2008, OUR FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE ON A

RECURRING BASIS INCLUDED $15.0 BILLION OF ASSETS, OF WHICH $1.7

BILLION (11%) WERE CLASSIFIED AS LEVEL 3. IN ADDITION, OUR

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE ON A RECURRING

BASIS INCLUDED $421 MILLION OF LIABILITIES, OF WHICH $147

MILLION (35%) WERE CLASSIFIED AS LEVEL 3. DURING 2008, WE

TRANSFERRED APPROXIMATELY $680 MILLION OF ASSETS FROM LEVEL 3 TO

LEVEL 2. THESE ASSETS PRIMARILY CONSISTED OF FLOATING-RATE NOTES

THAT WERE TRANSFERRED FROM LEVEL 3 TO LEVEL 2 DUE TO A GREATER

AVAILABILITY OF OBSERVABLE MARKET DATA

AND/OR

NON-BINDING MARKET CONSENSUS PRICES TO VALUE OR CORROBORATE THE

VALUE OF OUR INSTRUMENTS. DURING 2008, WE RECOGNIZED AN

INSIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF LOSSES ON THE ASSETS THAT WERE

TRANSFERRED FROM LEVEL 3 TO LEVEL 2.

DURING 2008, THE LEVEL 3 ASSETS

AND LIABILITIES THAT ARE MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE ON A RECURRING

BASIS EXPERIENCED NET UNREALIZED FAIR VALUE DECLINES TOTALING

$160 MILLION. OF THESE DECLINES, $111 MILLION WAS RECOGNIZED IN

OUR CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME. WE BELIEVE THAT THE

REMAINING $49 MILLION, INCLUDED IN OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME,

REPRESENTS A TEMPORARY DECLINE IN THE FAIR VALUE OF

AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE INVESTMENTS. DURING 2008, WE DID NOT

EXPERIENCE ANY SIGNIFICANT REALIZED GAINS (LOSSES) RELATED TO

THE LEVEL 3 ASSETS OR LIABILITIES IN OUR PORTFOLIO.

MARKETABLE

DEBT INSTRUMENTS

AS OF DECEMBER 27, 2008, OUR

ASSETS MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE ON A RECURRING BASIS INCLUDED

$14.2 BILLION OF MARKETABLE DEBT INSTRUMENTS. OF THESE

INSTRUMENTS, APPROXIMATELY $525 MILLION WAS CLASSIFIED AS LEVEL

1, APPROXIMATELY $12.0 BILLION AS LEVEL 2, AND APPROXIMATELY

$1.6 BILLION AS LEVEL 3.

WHEN AVAILABLE, WE USE OBSERVABLE

MARKET PRICES FOR IDENTICAL SECURITIES TO VALUE OUR MARKETABLE

DEBT INSTRUMENTS. IF OBSERVABLE MARKET PRICES ARE NOT AVAILABLE,

WE USE NON-BINDING MARKET CONSENSUS PRICES THAT WE SEEK TO

CORROBORATE WITH OBSERVABLE MARKET DATA, IF AVAILABLE, OR

NON-OBSERVABLE MARKET DATA. WHEN PRICES FROM MULTIPLE SOURCES

ARE AVAILABLE FOR A GIVEN INSTRUMENT, WE USE OBSERVABLE MARKET

QUOTES TO PRICE OUR INSTRUMENTS, IN LIEU OF PRICES FROM OTHER

SOURCES.

OUR BALANCE OF MARKETABLE DEBT

INSTRUMENTS THAT ARE MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE ON A RECURRING BASIS

AND CLASSIFIED AS LEVEL 1 WAS CLASSIFIED AS SUCH DUE TO THE

USAGE OF OBSERVABLE MARKET PRICES FOR IDENTICAL SECURITIES THAT

ARE TRADED IN ACTIVE MARKETS. MARKETABLE DEBT INSTRUMENTS IN

THIS CATEGORY GENERALLY INCLUDE CERTAIN OF OUR FLOATING-RATE

NOTES, CORPORATE BONDS, AND MONEY MARKET FUND DEPOSITS.

MANAGEMENT JUDGMENT WAS REQUIRED TO DETERMINE OUR POLICY THAT

DEFINES THE LEVELS AT WHICH SUFFICIENT VOLUME AND FREQUENCY OF

TRANSACTIONS ARE MET FOR A MARKET TO BE CONSIDERED ACTIVE. OUR

ASSESSMENT OF AN ACTIVE MARKET FOR OUR MARKETABLE DEBT

INSTRUMENTS GENERALLY TAKES INTO CONSIDERATION ACTIVITY DURING

EACH WEEK OF THE ONE-MONTH PERIOD PRIOR TO THE VALUATION DATE OF

EACH INDIVIDUAL INSTRUMENT, INCLUDING THE NUMBER OF DAYS EACH

INDIVIDUAL INSTRUMENT TRADES AND THE AVERAGE WEEKLY TRADING

VOLUME IN RELATION TO THE TOTAL OUTSTANDING AMOUNT OF THE ISSUED

INSTRUMENT.

APPROXIMATELY 10% OF OUR BALANCE

OF MARKETABLE DEBT INSTRUMENTS THAT ARE MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE

ON A RECURRING BASIS AND CLASSIFIED AS LEVEL 2 WAS CLASSIFIED AS

SUCH DUE TO THE USAGE OF OBSERVABLE MARKET PRICES FOR IDENTICAL

SECURITIES THAT ARE TRADED IN LESS ACTIVE MARKETS. WHEN

OBSERVABLE MARKET PRICES FOR IDENTICAL SECURITIES ARE NOT

AVAILABLE, WE PRICE OUR MARKETABLE DEBT INSTRUMENTS USING.

NON-BINDING MARKET CONSENSUS PRICES THAT ARE CORROBORATED WITH

OBSERVABLE MARKET DATA; QUOTED MARKET PRICES FOR SIMILAR

INSTRUMENTS; OR PRICING MODELS, SUCH AS A DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW

MODEL, WITH ALL SIGNIFICANT INPUTS DERIVED FROM OR CORROBORATED

WITH OBSERVABLE MARKET DATA. NON-BINDING MARKET CONSENSUS PRICES

ARE BASED ON THE PROPRIETARY VALUATION MODELS OF PRICING

PROVIDERS OR BROKERS. THESE VALUATION MODELS INCORPORATE A

NUMBER OF INPUTS, INCLUDING NON-BINDING AND BINDING BROKER

QUOTES; OBSERVABLE MARKET PRICES FOR IDENTICAL

AND/OR

SIMILAR SECURITIES; AND THE INTERNAL ASSUMPTIONS OF PRICING

PROVIDERS OR BROKERS THAT USE OBSERVABLE MARKET INPUTS AND TO A

LESSER DEGREE NON-OBSERVABLE MARKET INPUTS. WE CORROBORATE THE

NON-BINDING MARKET CONSENSUS PRICES WITH OBSERVABLE MARKET DATA

USING STATISTICAL MODELS WHEN OBSERVABLE MARKET DATA EXISTS. THE

DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW MODEL USES OBSERVABLE MARKET INPUTS, SUCH

AS LIBOR-BASED YIELD CURVES, CURRENCY SPOT AND FORWARD RATES,

AND CREDIT RATINGS. APPROXIMATELY 45% OF OUR BALANCE OF

MARKETABLE DEBT INSTRUMENTS THAT ARE MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE ON A

RECURRING BASIS AND CLASSIFIED AS LEVEL 2 WAS CLASSIFIED AS SUCH

DUE TO THE USAGE OF A DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW MODEL, APPROXIMATELY

40% DUE TO THE USAGE OF NON-BINDING MARKET CONSENSUS PRICES THAT

ARE CORROBORATED WITH OBSERVABLE MARKET DATA, AND APPROXIMATELY

5% DUE TO THE USAGE OF QUOTED MARKET PRICES FOR SIMILAR

INSTRUMENTS. MARKETABLE DEBT INSTRUMENTS CLASSIFIED AS LEVEL 2

GENERALLY INCLUDE COMMERCIAL PAPER, BANK TIME DEPOSITS,

MUNICIPAL BONDS, CERTAIN OF OUR MONEY MARKET FUND DEPOSITS, AND

A MAJORITY OF FLOATING-RATE NOTES AND CORPORATE BONDS.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

MANAGEMENTS

DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)

OUR MARKETABLE DEBT INSTRUMENTS

THAT ARE MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE ON A RECURRING BASIS AND

CLASSIFIED AS LEVEL 3 WERE CLASSIFIED AS SUCH DUE TO THE

LACK OF OBSERVABLE MARKET DATA TO CORROBORATE EITHER THE

NON-BINDING MARKET CONSENSUS PRICES OR THE NON-BINDING BROKER

QUOTES. WHEN OBSERVABLE MARKET DATA IS NOT AVAILABLE, WE

CORROBORATE THE NON-BINDING MARKET CONSENSUS PRICES AND

NON-BINDING BROKER QUOTES USING UNOBSERVABLE DATA, IF AVAILABLE.

MARKETABLE DEBT INSTRUMENTS IN THIS CATEGORY GENERALLY INCLUDE

ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES AND CERTAIN OF OUR FLOATING-RATE NOTES

AND CORPORATE BONDS. ALL OF OUR INVESTMENTS IN ASSET-BACKED

SECURITIES WERE CLASSIFIED AS LEVEL 3, AND SUBSTANTIALLY

ALL OF THEM WERE VALUED USING NON-BINDING MARKET CONSENSUS

PRICES THAT WE WERE NOT ABLE TO CORROBORATE WITH OBSERVABLE

MARKET DATA DUE TO THE LACK OF TRANSPARENCY IN THE MARKET FOR

ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES.

MONEY

MARKET FUND DEPOSITS

AS OF DECEMBER 27, 2008, OUR

MARKETABLE DEBT INSTRUMENTS INCLUDED $422 MILLION OF MONEY

MARKET FUND DEPOSITS. OF THESE MONEY MARKET FUND DEPOSITS,

$373 MILLION WAS CLASSIFIED AS LEVEL 1 AND

$49 MILLION WAS CLASSIFIED AS LEVEL 2.

EQUITY

SECURITIES

AS OF DECEMBER 27, 2008, OUR

PORTFOLIO OF ASSETS MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE ON A RECURRING BASIS

INCLUDED $352 MILLION OF MARKETABLE EQUITY SECURITIES. OF

THESE SECURITIES, $308 MILLION WAS CLASSIFIED AS

LEVEL 1 BECAUSE THE VALUATIONS WERE BASED ON QUOTED PRICES

FOR IDENTICAL SECURITIES IN ACTIVE MARKETS. OUR ASSESSMENT OF AN

ACTIVE MARKET FOR OUR MARKETABLE EQUITY SECURITIES GENERALLY

TAKES INTO CONSIDERATION ACTIVITY DURING EACH WEEK OF THE

ONE-MONTH PERIOD PRIOR TO THE VALUATION DATE FOR EACH INDIVIDUAL

SECURITY, INCLUDING THE NUMBER OF DAYS EACH INDIVIDUAL EQUITY

SECURITY TRADES AND THE AVERAGE WEEKLY TRADING VOLUME IN

RELATION TO THE TOTAL OUTSTANDING SHARES OF THAT SECURITY. THE

FAIR VALUES OF OUR INVESTMENTS IN THE NEW CLEARWIRE CORPORATION

($148 MILLION) AND VMWARE, INC. ($137 MILLION)

CONSTITUTED MOST OF THE FAIR VALUES OF THE MARKETABLE EQUITY

SECURITIES THAT WE CLASSIFIED AS LEVEL 1. OUR INVESTMENT IN

VMWARE WAS RECLASSIFIED FROM LEVEL 2 TO LEVEL 1 DURING

2008, DUE TO THE EXPIRATION OF OUR TRANSFER RESTRICTION ON

VMWARE STOCK.

THE REMAINING MARKETABLE EQUITY

SECURITIES ($44 MILLION) WERE CLASSIFIED AS LEVEL 2

BECAUSE THEIR VALUATIONS WERE EITHER BASED ON QUOTED PRICES FOR

IDENTICAL SECURITIES IN LESS ACTIVE MARKETS OR ADJUSTED FOR

SECURITY-SPECIFIC RESTRICTIONS. THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR INVESTMENT

IN MICRON ($42 MILLION) CONSTITUTED SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF

THE FAIR VALUES OF THE MARKETABLE EQUITY SECURITIES THAT WE

CLASSIFIED AS LEVEL 2. IN MEASURING THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR

INVESTMENT IN MICRON, OUR VALUATION REFLECTED A DISCOUNT FROM

THE QUOTED MARKET PRICE OF MICRONS STOCK, DUE TO OUR

INVESTMENT BEING IN A FORM OF RIGHTS EXCHANGEABLE INTO

UNREGISTERED MICRON STOCK.

AS OF DECEMBER 27, 2008, OUR

PORTFOLIO OF ASSETS MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE ON A RECURRING BASIS

INCLUDED $299 MILLION OF EQUITY SECURITIES OFFSETTING

DEFERRED COMPENSATION. ALL OF THESE SECURITIES WERE CLASSIFIED

AS LEVEL 1, BECAUSE THEIR VALUATIONS WERE BASED ON QUOTED

PRICES FOR IDENTICAL SECURITIES IN ACTIVE MARKETS.

WERE NOT RECORDED AS LIABILITIES ON OUR CONSOLIDATED BALANCE

SHEET AS OF DECEMBER 27, 2008, AS WE HAD NOT YET RECEIVED

THE RELATED GOODS OR TAKEN TITLE TO THE PROPERTY.

2

OTHER PURCHASE OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS INCLUDE PAYMENTS

DUE UNDER VARIOUS TYPES OF LICENSES, AGREEMENTS TO PURCHASE RAW

MATERIALS OR OTHER GOODS, AS WELL AS PAYMENTS DUE UNDER

NON-CONTINGENT FUNDING OBLIGATIONS. FUNDING OBLIGATIONS INCLUDE,

FOR EXAMPLE, AGREEMENTS TO FUND VARIOUS PROJECTS WITH OTHER

COMPANIES.

3

AMOUNTS REPRESENT TOTAL ANTICIPATED CASH PAYMENTS, INCLUDING

ANTICIPATED INTEREST PAYMENTS THAT ARE NOT RECORDED ON THE

CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS AND THE SHORT-TERM PORTION OF THE

OBLIGATION. ANY FUTURE SETTLEMENT OF CONVERTIBLE DEBT WOULD

REDUCE ANTICIPATED INTEREST AND/OR PRINCIPAL PAYMENTS. AMOUNTS

EXCLUDE FAIR VALUE ADJUSTMENTS SUCH AS DISCOUNTS OR PREMIUMS

THAT AFFECT THE AMOUNT RECORDED ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE

SHEETS.

4

WE ARE UNABLE TO RELIABLY ESTIMATE THE TIMING OF FUTURE

PAYMENTS RELATED TO UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS; THEREFORE,

$736 MILLION OF INCOME TAXES PAYABLE HAS BEEN EXCLUDED FROM

THE TABLE ABOVE. HOWEVER, LONG-TERM INCOME TAXES PAYABLE,

INCLUDED ON OUR CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET, INCLUDES THESE

UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS, REDUCED BY THE ASSOCIATED FEDERAL

DEDUCTION FOR STATE TAXES AND

NON-U.S.

TAX

CREDITS.

5

OTHER LONG-TERM LIABILITIES IN THE TABLE ABOVE INCLUDE THE

SHORT-TERM PORTION OF OTHER LONG-TERM LIABILITIES. EXPECTED

CONTRIBUTIONS TO OUR U.S. AND

NON-U.S.

PENSION PLANS AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS OF

$67 MILLION TO BE MADE DURING 2009 ARE ALSO INCLUDED;

HOWEVER, FUNDING PROJECTIONS BEYOND 2009 ARE NOT PRACTICAL TO

ESTIMATE.

6

TOTAL GENERALLY EXCLUDES CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS ALREADY

RECORDED ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET AS CURRENT

LIABILITIES.

CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS FOR

PURCHASES OF GOODS OR SERVICES GENERALLY INCLUDE AGREEMENTS THAT

ARE ENFORCEABLE AND LEGALLY BINDING ON INTEL AND THAT SPECIFY

ALL SIGNIFICANT TERMS, INCLUDING FIXED OR MINIMUM QUANTITIES TO

BE PURCHASED; FIXED, MINIMUM, OR VARIABLE PRICE PROVISIONS; AND

THE APPROXIMATE TIMING OF THE TRANSACTION. THE TABLE ABOVE ALSO

INCLUDES AGREEMENTS TO PURCHASE RAW MATERIALS THAT HAVE

CANCELLATION PROVISIONS REQUIRING LITTLE OR NO PAYMENT. THE

AMOUNTS UNDER SUCH CONTRACTS ARE INCLUDED IN THE TABLE ABOVE

BECAUSE MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT CANCELLATION OF THESE CONTRACTS

IS UNLIKELY AND EXPECTS TO MAKE FUTURE CASH PAYMENTS ACCORDING

TO THE CONTRACT TERMS OR IN SIMILAR AMOUNTS FOR SIMILAR

MATERIALS. FOR OTHER OBLIGATIONS WITH CANCELLATION PROVISIONS,

THE AMOUNTS INCLUDED IN THE TABLE ABOVE WERE LIMITED TO THE

NON-CANCELABLE PORTION OF THE AGREEMENT TERMS

AND/OR

THE

MINIMUM CANCELLATION FEE.

WE HAVE ENTERED INTO CERTAIN

AGREEMENTS FOR THE PURCHASE OF RAW MATERIALS OR OTHER GOODS THAT

SPECIFY MINIMUM PRICES AND QUANTITIES BASED ON A PERCENTAGE OF

THE TOTAL AVAILABLE MARKET OR BASED ON A PERCENTAGE OF OUR

FUTURE PURCHASING REQUIREMENTS. DUE TO THE UNCERTAINTY OF THE

FUTURE MARKET AND OUR FUTURE PURCHASING REQUIREMENTS,

OBLIGATIONS UNDER THESE AGREEMENTS ARE NOT INCLUDED IN THE TABLE

ABOVE. WE ESTIMATE OUR OBLIGATION UNDER THESE AGREEMENTS AS OF

DECEMBER 27, 2008 TO BE APPROXIMATELY AS FOLLOWS: LESS THAN

ONE YEAR$309 MILLION; ONE TO THREE

YEARS$315 MILLION; THREE TO FIVE YEARSZERO;

MORE THAN FIVE YEARSZERO. OUR PURCHASE ORDERS FOR OTHER

PRODUCTS ARE BASED ON OUR CURRENT MANUFACTURING NEEDS AND ARE

FULFILLED BY OUR VENDORS WITHIN SHORT TIME HORIZONS. IN

ADDITION, SOME OF OUR PURCHASE ORDERS REPRESENT AUTHORIZATIONS

TO PURCHASE RATHER THAN BINDING AGREEMENTS.

CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS THAT ARE

CONTINGENT UPON THE ACHIEVEMENT OF CERTAIN MILESTONES ARE NOT

INCLUDED IN THE TABLE ABOVE. THESE OBLIGATIONS INCLUDE

MILESTONE-BASED CO-MARKETING AGREEMENTS, CONTINGENT

FUNDING/PAYMENT OBLIGATIONS, AND MILESTONE-BASED EQUITY

INVESTMENT FUNDING. THESE ARRANGEMENTS ARE NOT CONSIDERED

CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS UNTIL THE MILESTONE IS MET BY THE THIRD

PARTY. AS OF DECEMBER 27, 2008, ASSUMING THAT ALL FUTURE

MILESTONES ARE MET, ADDITIONAL REQUIRED PAYMENTS WOULD BE

APPROXIMATELY $150 MILLION.

FOR THE MAJORITY OF RESTRICTED

STOCK UNITS GRANTED, THE NUMBER OF SHARES ISSUED ON THE DATE THE

RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS VEST IS NET OF THE STATUTORY WITHHOLDING

REQUIREMENTS PAID BY INTEL ON BEHALF OF OUR EMPLOYEES. THE

OBLIGATION TO PAY THE RELATIVE TAXING AUTHORITY IS NOT INCLUDED

IN THE TABLE ABOVE, AS THE AMOUNT IS CONTINGENT UPON CONTINUED

EMPLOYMENT. IN ADDITION, THE AMOUNT OF THE OBLIGATION IS

UNKNOWN, AS IT IS BASED IN PART ON THE MARKET PRICE OF OUR

COMMON STOCK WHEN THE AWARDS VEST.

THE EXPECTED TIMING OF PAYMENTS OF

THE OBLIGATIONS ABOVE ARE ESTIMATES BASED ON CURRENT

INFORMATION. TIMING OF PAYMENTS AND ACTUAL AMOUNTS PAID MAY BE

DIFFERENT, DEPENDING ON THE TIME OF RECEIPT OF GOODS OR

SERVICES, OR CHANGES TO

AGREED-UPON

AMOUNTS FOR SOME OBLIGATIONS. AMOUNTS DISCLOSED AS CONTINGENT OR

MILESTONE-BASED OBLIGATIONS ARE DEPENDENT ON THE ACHIEVEMENT OF

THE MILESTONES OR THE OCCURRENCE OF THE CONTINGENT EVENTS AND

CAN VARY SIGNIFICANTLY.

WE HAVE A CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATION

TO PURCHASE THE OUTPUT OF IMFT AND IMFS IN PROPORTION TO OUR

INVESTMENTS, CURRENTLY 49% IN EACH OF THESE VENTURES. HOWEVER,

IMFS IS IN ITS CONSTRUCTION PHASE AND HAS HAD NO PRODUCTION TO

DATE. SEE NOTE 6: EQUITY METHOD AND COST METHOD

INVESTMENTS IN PART II, ITEM 8 OF THIS

FORM 10-K.

ADDITIONALLY, WE HAVE ENTERED INTO VARIOUS CONTRACTUAL

COMMITMENTS IN RELATION TO OUR INVESTMENTS IN IMFT AND IMFS.

SOME OF THESE COMMITMENTS ARE WITH MICRON, AND SOME ARE DIRECTLY

WITH IMFT OR IMFS. THE FOLLOWING ARE THE SIGNIFICANT CONTRACTUAL

COMMITMENTS.



SUBJECT TO CERTAIN CONDITIONS,

INTEL AND MICRON EACH AGREED TO CONTRIBUTE UP TO APPROXIMATELY

$1.7 BILLION FOR IMFS IN THE THREE YEARS FOLLOWING THE

INITIAL CAPITAL CONTRIBUTION. OF THAT AMOUNT, AS OF

DECEMBER 27, 2008, OUR REMAINING COMMITMENT WAS

APPROXIMATELY $1.3 BILLION. HOWEVER, THE CONSTRUCTION OF

THE IMFS FABRICATION FACILITY HAS BEEN PLACED ON HOLD.



WE ALSO HAVE SEVERAL AGREEMENTS

WITH MICRON RELATED TO INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS, AND

R&D FUNDING RELATED TO NAND FLASH MANUFACTURING AND IMFT.

SEE NOTE 6: EQUITY METHOD AND COST METHOD

INVESTMENTS IN PART II, ITEM 8 OF THIS

ARRANGEMENTS

AS OF DECEMBER 27, 2008, WITH

THE EXCEPTION OF A GUARANTEE FOR THE REPAYMENT OF

$275 MILLION IN PRINCIPAL OF THE PAYMENT OBLIGATIONS OF

NUMONYX UNDER ITS SENIOR CREDIT FACILITY, AS WELL AS ACCRUED

UNPAID INTEREST, EXPENSES OF THE LENDERS, AND PENALTIES, WE DID

NOT HAVE ANY SIGNIFICANT OFF-BALANCE-SHEET ARRANGEMENTS, AS

ACTUAL RESULTS TO DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM OUR EXPECTATIONS. SEE

THE RISKS DESCRIBED IN RISK FACTORS IN PART I,

ITEM 1A OF THIS

OUR EXPECTATIONS FOR 2009 ARE AS

FOLLOWS.



TOTAL

SPENDING.

WE

EXPECT SPENDING ON R&D, PLUS MARKETING, GENERAL AND

ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES, IN 2009 TO BE BETWEEN

$10.4 BILLION AND $10.6 BILLION. THIS EXPECTATION FOR

OUR TOTAL SPENDING IN 2009 IS LOWER THAN OUR 2008 SPENDING BY

APPROXIMATELY 6% DUE TO TARGETED SPENDING REDUCTIONS, LOWER

SPENDING FOR REVENUE AND PROFIT-DEPENDENT ITEMS, AND THE

STANDARD SHIFT BETWEEN R&D AND COST OF SALES SPENDING AS WE

RAMP OUR NEW 32NM PROCESS TECHNOLOGY.



RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

SPENDING.

APPROXIMATELY

$5.4 BILLION.



CAPITAL

SPENDING.

WE

EXPECT CAPITAL SPENDING IN 2009 TO BE FLAT TO SLIGHTLY DOWN FROM

CAPITAL SPENDING IN 2008 OF $5.2 BILLION. WE EXPECT CAPITAL

SPENDING FOR 2009 TO PRIMARILY CONSIST OF INVESTMENTS IN 32NM

PROCESS TECHNOLOGY.



DEPRECIATION.

APPROXIMATELY

$4.8 BILLION, PLUS OR MINUS $100 MILLION.



TAX

RATE.

APPROXIMATELY

27%. THE ESTIMATED EFFECTIVE TAX RATE IS BASED ON TAX LAW IN

EFFECT AS OF DECEMBER 27, 2008 AND EXPECTED INCOME.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

ITEM 7A.

QUANTITATIVE

AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

WE ARE EXPOSED TO FINANCIAL MARKET

RISKS, PRIMARILY CHANGES IN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES, INTEREST

RATES, AND EQUITY PRICES. WE USE DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL

INSTRUMENTS PRIMARILY TO MANAGE CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE RISK AND

INTEREST RATE RISK, AND TO A LESSER EXTENT, EQUITY MARKET RISK

AND COMMODITY PRICE RISK. ALL OF THE POTENTIAL CHANGES NOTED

BELOW ARE BASED ON SENSITIVITY ANALYSES PERFORMED ON OUR

FINANCIAL POSITIONS AS OF DECEMBER 27, 2008 AND

DECEMBER 29, 2007. ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER MATERIALLY.

CURRENCY

EXCHANGE RATES

WE GENERALLY HEDGE CURRENCY RISKS

OF

NON-U.S.-DOLLAR-DENOMINATED

INVESTMENTS IN DEBT INSTRUMENTS WITH OFFSETTING CURRENCY

BORROWINGS, CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS, OR CURRENCY INTEREST

RATE SWAPS. GAINS AND LOSSES ON THESE

NON-U.S.-CURRENCY

INVESTMENTS WOULD GENERALLY BE OFFSET BY CORRESPONDING LOSSES

AND GAINS ON THE RELATED HEDGING INSTRUMENTS, RESULTING IN A

NEGLIGIBLE NET EXPOSURE.

A MAJORITY OF OUR REVENUE,

EXPENSE, AND CAPITAL PURCHASING ACTIVITIES ARE TRANSACTED IN

U.S. DOLLARS. HOWEVER, CERTAIN OPERATING EXPENDITURES AND

CAPITAL PURCHASES ARE INCURRED IN OR EXPOSED TO OTHER

CURRENCIES, PRIMARILY THE EURO, THE JAPANESE YEN, AND THE

ISRAELI SHEKEL. WE HAVE ESTABLISHED BALANCE SHEET AND FORECASTED

TRANSACTION CURRENCY RISK MANAGEMENT PROGRAMS TO PROTECT AGAINST

FLUCTUATIONS IN FAIR VALUE AND THE VOLATILITY OF FUTURE CASH

FLOWS CAUSED BY CHANGES IN EXCHANGE RATES. WE GENERALLY UTILIZE

CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS AND, TO A LESSER EXTENT, CURRENCY

OPTIONS IN THESE HEDGING PROGRAMS. OUR HEDGING PROGRAMS REDUCE,

BUT DO NOT ALWAYS ENTIRELY ELIMINATE, THE IMPACT OF CURRENCY

EXCHANGE RATE MOVEMENTS (SEE RISK FACTORS IN

PART I, ITEM 1A OF THIS

FORM 10-K).

WE CONSIDERED THE HISTORICAL TRENDS IN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES

AND DETERMINED THAT IT WAS REASONABLY POSSIBLE THAT A WEIGHTED

AVERAGE ADVERSE CHANGE OF 20% IN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES COULD

BE EXPERIENCED IN THE NEAR TERM. SUCH AN ADVERSE CHANGE, AFTER

TAKING INTO ACCOUNT HEDGES AND OFFSETTING POSITIONS, WOULD HAVE

RESULTED IN AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON INCOME BEFORE TAXES OF LESS

THAN $55 MILLION AT THE END OF 2008 (LESS THAN

$35 MILLION AT THE END OF 2007, USING A WEIGHTED AVERAGE

ADVERSE CHANGE OF 15% IN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES). THE WEIGHTED

AVERAGE ADVERSE CHANGE INCREASED FROM THE END OF 2007 TO THE END

OF 2008, DUE TO A HIGHER RELATIVE WEIGHTING OF MORE VOLATILE

CURRENCIES.

INTEREST

RATES

WE ARE EXPOSED TO INTEREST RATE

RISK RELATED TO OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO AND DEBT ISSUANCES. THE

PRIMARY OBJECTIVE OF OUR INVESTMENTS IN DEBT INSTRUMENTS IS TO

PRESERVE PRINCIPAL WHILE MAXIMIZING YIELDS. TO ACHIEVE THIS

OBJECTIVE, THE RETURNS ON OUR INVESTMENTS IN DEBT INSTRUMENTS

ARE GENERALLY BASED ON THREE-MONTH LIBOR, OR, IF THE MATURITIES

ARE LONGER THAN THREE MONTHS, THE RETURNS ARE GENERALLY SWAPPED

INTO U.S. DOLLAR THREE-MONTH LIBOR-BASED RETURNS. THE

CURRENT FINANCIAL MARKETS ARE EXTREMELY VOLATILE. A HYPOTHETICAL

1.0% DECREASE IN INTEREST RATES, AFTER TAKING INTO ACCOUNT

HEDGES AND OFFSETTING POSITIONS, WOULD HAVE RESULTED IN A

DECREASE IN THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR NET INVESTMENT POSITION OF

APPROXIMATELY $135 MILLION AS OF DECEMBER 27, 2008 AND

$80 MILLION AS OF DECEMBER 29, 2007. THE HYPOTHETICAL

1.0% INTEREST RATE DECREASE WOULD HAVE RESULTED IN AN INCREASE

IN THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR DEBT ISSUANCES OF APPROXIMATELY

$150 MILLION AS OF DECEMBER 27, 2008 AND WOULD HAVE

RESULTED IN AN INCREASE IN THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR INVESTMENT

PORTFOLIO OF APPROXIMATELY $15 MILLION AS OF

DECEMBER 27, 2008 (AN INCREASE IN THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR

DEBT ISSUANCES OF APPROXIMATELY $95 MILLION AS OF

DECEMBER 29, 2007 AND AN INCREASE IN THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR

INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO OF APPROXIMATELY $15 MILLION AS OF

DECEMBER 29, 2007). THE FLUCTUATIONS IN FAIR VALUE OF OUR

DEBT ISSUANCES AND INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO REFLECT ONLY THE DIRECT

IMPACT OF THE CHANGE IN INTEREST RATES. OTHER ECONOMIC

VARIABLES, SUCH AS EQUITY MARKET FLUCTUATIONS AND CHANGES IN

RELATIVE CREDIT RISK, COULD RESULT IN A SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER

DECLINE IN OUR NET INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION

ON HOW CREDIT RISK IS FACTORED INTO THE VALUATION OF OUR

INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO AND DEBT ISSUANCES, SEE FAIR

VALUE IN PART II, ITEM 7 OF THIS

FORM 10-K.

EQUITY

PRICES

OUR MARKETABLE EQUITY INVESTMENTS

INCLUDE MARKETABLE EQUITY SECURITIES AND EQUITY DERIVATIVE

INSTRUMENTS SUCH AS WARRANTS AND OPTIONS. TO THE EXTENT THAT OUR

MARKETABLE EQUITY SECURITIES HAVE STRATEGIC VALUE, WE TYPICALLY

DO NOT ATTEMPT TO REDUCE OR ELIMINATE OUR EQUITY MARKET EXPOSURE

THROUGH HEDGING ACTIVITIES; HOWEVER, FOR OUR INVESTMENTS IN

STRATEGIC EQUITY DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS, INCLUDING WARRANTS, WE

MAY ENTER INTO TRANSACTIONS TO REDUCE OR ELIMINATE THE EQUITY

MARKET RISKS. FOR SECURITIES THAT WE NO LONGER CONSIDER

STRATEGIC, WE EVALUATE LEGAL, MARKET, AND ECONOMIC FACTORS IN

OUR DECISION ON THE TIMING OF DISPOSAL AND WHETHER IT IS

POSSIBLE AND APPROPRIATE TO HEDGE THE EQUITY MARKET RISK.

53

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE MARKETABLE EQUITY SECURITIES

INCLUDED IN TRADING ASSETS ARE HELD TO GENERATE RETURNS THAT

SEEK TO OFFSET CHANGES IN LIABILITIES RELATED TO THE EQUITY AND

OTHER MARKET RISKS OF CERTAIN DEFERRED COMPENSATION

ARRANGEMENTS. THE GAINS AND LOSSES FROM CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE OF

THESE EQUITY SECURITIES ARE OFFSET BY THE GAINS AND LOSSES ON

THE RELATED LIABILITIES. ASSUMING A DECLINE IN MARKET PRICES OF

APPROXIMATELY 25%, OUR NET EXPOSURE TO LOSS WAS APPROXIMATELY

$40 MILLION AS OF DECEMBER 27, 2008 AND APPROXIMATELY

$20 MILLION AS OF DECEMBER 29, 2007.

AS OF DECEMBER 27, 2008, THE

FAIR VALUE OF OUR AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE MARKETABLE EQUITY

SECURITIES AND OUR EQUITY DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS, INCLUDING

HEDGING POSITIONS, WAS $362 MILLION ($1.0 BILLION AS

OF DECEMBER 29, 2007). OUR INVESTMENTS IN THE NEW CLEARWIRE

CORPORATION, VMWARE, AND MICRON CONSTITUTED 90% OF OUR

MARKETABLE EQUITY SECURITIES AS OF DECEMBER 27, 2008, AND

WERE CARRIED AT A FAIR MARKET VALUE OF $148 MILLION,

$137 MILLION, AND $42 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. THE

CURRENT EQUITY MARKETS ARE EXTREMELY VOLATILE. ASSUMING A LOSS

OF 60% IN MARKET PRICES, AND AFTER REFLECTING THE IMPACT OF

HEDGES AND OFFSETTING POSITIONS, THE AGGREGATE VALUE OF OUR

MARKETABLE EQUITY INVESTMENTS COULD DECREASE BY APPROXIMATELY

$220 MILLION, BASED ON THE VALUE AS OF DECEMBER 27,

2008 (A DECREASE IN VALUE OF $565 MILLION, BASED ON THE

VALUE AS OF DECEMBER 29, 2007 USING AN ASSUMED LOSS OF

55%). THE INCREASE IN THE ASSUMED LOSS PERCENTAGE FROM

DECEMBER 29, 2007 TO DECEMBER 27, 2008 IS DUE TO A

HIGHER RELATIVE WEIGHTING OF MORE VOLATILE INVESTMENTS.

MANY OF THE SAME FACTORS THAT

COULD RESULT IN AN ADVERSE MOVEMENT OF EQUITY MARKET PRICES

AFFECT OUR NON-MARKETABLE EQUITY INVESTMENTS, ALTHOUGH WE CANNOT

ALWAYS QUANTIFY THE IMPACT DIRECTLY. THE CURRENT FINANCIAL

MARKETS ARE EXTREMELY VOLATILE AND THERE HAS BEEN A TIGHTENING

OF THE CREDIT MARKETS, WHICH COULD NEGATIVELY AFFECT THE

PROSPECTS OF THE COMPANIES WE INVEST IN, THEIR ABILITY TO RAISE

ADDITIONAL CAPITAL, AND THE LIKELIHOOD OF OUR BEING ABLE TO

REALIZE VALUE IN OUR INVESTMENTS THROUGH LIQUIDITY EVENTS SUCH

AS INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERINGS, MERGERS, AND PRIVATE SALES. THESE

TYPES OF INVESTMENTS INVOLVE A GREAT DEAL OF RISK, AND THERE CAN

BE NO ASSURANCE THAT ANY SPECIFIC COMPANY WILL GROW OR BECOME

SUCCESSFUL; CONSEQUENTLY, WE COULD LOSE ALL OR PART OF OUR

INVESTMENT. OUR NON-MARKETABLE EQUITY INVESTMENTS, EXCLUDING

INVESTMENTS ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER THE EQUITY METHOD, HAD A

CARRYING AMOUNT OF $1.0 BILLION AS OF DECEMBER 27,

2008 ($805 MILLION AS OF DECEMBER 29, 2007). AS OF

DECEMBER 27, 2008, THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF OUR

NON-MARKETABLE EQUITY METHOD INVESTMENTS WAS $3.0 BILLION

($2.6 BILLION AS OF DECEMBER 29, 2007). MOST OF THE

BALANCE AS OF DECEMBER 27, 2008 WAS CONCENTRATED IN

COMPANIES IN THE FLASH MEMORY MARKET SEGMENT AND WIRELESS

CONNECTIVITY MARKET SEGMENT. OUR FLASH MEMORY MARKET SEGMENT

INVESTMENTS INCLUDE OUR INVESTMENT OF $1.7 BILLION IN IMFT

($2.2 BILLION AS OF DECEMBER 29, 2007),

$329 MILLION IN IMFS ($146 MILLION AS OF

DECEMBER 29, 2007), AND $484 MILLION IN NUMONYX. OUR

WIRELESS CONNECTIVITY MARKET SEGMENT INVESTMENTS INCLUDE OUR

NON-MARKETABLE EQUITY METHOD INVESTMENT IN CLEARWIRE LLC OF

$238 MILLION. SEE NOTE 6: EQUITY METHOD AND COST

NOTE 1.

BASIS OF PRESENTATION

WE HAVE A 52- OR 53-WEEK FISCAL

YEAR THAT ENDS ON THE LAST SATURDAY IN DECEMBER. FISCAL YEAR

2008, A 52-WEEK YEAR, ENDED ON DECEMBER 27, 2008. FISCAL

YEAR 2007, A 52-WEEK YEAR, ENDED ON DECEMBER 29, 2007.

FISCAL YEAR 2006, A 52-WEEK YEAR, ENDED ON DECEMBER 30,

2006. THE NEXT 53-WEEK YEAR WILL END ON DECEMBER 31, 2011.

OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS INCLUDE THE ACCOUNTS OF INTEL CORPORATION AND OUR

WHOLLY OWNED SUBSIDIARIES. INTERCOMPANY ACCOUNTS AND

TRANSACTIONS HAVE BEEN ELIMINATED. WE USE THE EQUITY METHOD TO

ACCOUNT FOR EQUITY INVESTMENTS IN INSTANCES IN WHICH WE OWN

COMMON STOCK OR SIMILAR INTERESTS (AS DESCRIBED BY THE EMERGING

ISSUES TASK FORCE (EITF) ISSUE

NO. 02-14,

WHETHER AN INVESTOR SHOULD APPLY THE EQUITY METHOD OF

ACCOUNTING TO INVESTMENTS OTHER THAN COMMON STOCK), AND

HAVE THE ABILITY TO EXERCISE SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE, BUT NOT

CONTROL, OVER THE INVESTEE.

THE U.S. DOLLAR IS THE

FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY FOR INTEL AND OUR SUBSIDIARIES; THEREFORE,

WE DO NOT HAVE A TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENT RECORDED THROUGH

ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS). MONETARY ACCOUNTS

DENOMINATED IN

NON-U.S. CURRENCIES,

SUCH AS CASH OR PAYABLES TO VENDORS, HAVE BEEN REMEASURED TO THE

U.S. DOLLAR.

IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE ADOPTION OF

STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS (SFAS) NO. 159,

THE FAIR VALUE OPTION FOR FINANCIAL ASSETS AND FINANCIAL

LIABILITIESINCLUDING AN AMENDMENT OF FASB STATEMENT

NO. 115 (SFAS NO. 159), WE HAVE CLASSIFIED

CASH FLOWS FROM CERTAIN TRADING ASSETS AS CASH FLOWS FROM

INVESTING ACTIVITIES BEGINNING IN 2008. FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION,

SEE ACCOUNTING CHANGES IN NOTE 2.

ACCOUNTING POLICIES.

AS OF DECEMBER 27, 2008, OUR

OTHER ACCRUED LIABILITIES INCLUDED $447 MILLION IN CUSTOMER

CREDIT BALANCES. CUSTOMER CREDIT BALANCES WERE NOT SIGNIFICANT

AS OF DECEMBER 29, 2007.

ACCOUNTING POLICIES

USE OF

ESTIMATES

THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS IN CONFORMITY WITH U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED

ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES REQUIRES US TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND

JUDGMENTS THAT AFFECT THE AMOUNTS REPORTED IN OUR CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND THE ACCOMPANYING NOTES. THE ACCOUNTING

ESTIMATES THAT REQUIRE OUR MOST SIGNIFICANT, DIFFICULT, AND

SUBJECTIVE JUDGMENTS INCLUDE.



THE VALUATION OF NON-MARKETABLE

EQUITY INVESTMENTS AND THE DETERMINATION OF OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY

IMPAIRMENTS;



THE VALUATION OF INVESTMENTS IN

DEBT INSTRUMENTS AND THE DETERMINATION OF OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY

IMPAIRMENTS;



THE ASSESSMENT OF RECOVERABILITY

OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS;



THE RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT OF

CURRENT AND DEFERRED INCOME TAXES (INCLUDING THE MEASUREMENT OF

UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS); AND



THE VALUATION OF INVENTORY.

THE ACTUAL RESULTS THAT WE

EXPERIENCE MAY DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM OUR ESTIMATES.

CASH

AND CASH EQUIVALENTS

WE CONSIDER ALL LIQUID

AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE DEBT INSTRUMENTS WITH ORIGINAL MATURITIES

FROM THE DATE OF PURCHASE OF APPROXIMATELY THREE MONTHS OR LESS

TRADING ASSET INVESTMENTS INCLUDE.



MARKETABLE DEBT INSTRUMENTS

WHEN THE INTEREST RATE

OR FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATE RISK IS HEDGED AT INCEPTION BY A

RELATED DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENT. WE RECORD THE GAINS OR LOSSES OF

THESE INVESTMENTS ARISING FROM CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE DUE TO

INTEREST RATE AND CURRENCY MARKET FLUCTUATIONS AND CREDIT MARKET

EQUITY SECURITIES OFFSETTING

DEFERRED COMPENSATION

WHEN THE INVESTMENTS

SEEK TO OFFSET CHANGES IN LIABILITIES RELATED TO EQUITY AND

OTHER MARKET RISKS OF CERTAIN DEFERRED COMPENSATION

VALUE OF THESE EQUITY SECURITIES AGAINST LOSSES OR GAINS ON THE

RELATED LIABILITIES AND INCLUDE THEM IN INTEREST AND OTHER, NET.



MARKETABLE EQUITY SECURITIES

WHEN WE DEEM THE

INVESTMENTS NOT TO BE STRATEGIC IN NATURE AT THE TIME OF

USE OF DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS. FOR THESE MARKETABLE EQUITY

SECURITIES, WE INCLUDE GAINS OR LOSSES FROM CHANGES IN FAIR

VALUE, PRIMARILY OFFSET BY LOSSES OR GAINS ON RELATED DERIVATIVE

INSTRUMENTS, IN GAINS (LOSSES) ON OTHER EQUITY INVESTMENTS, NET.

DEBT

INSTRUMENT INVESTMENTS

WE CLASSIFY AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE

DEBT INSTRUMENTS WITH ORIGINAL MATURITIES AT THE DATE OF

PURCHASE GREATER THAN APPROXIMATELY THREE MONTHS AND REMAINING

MATURITIES LESS THAN ONE YEAR AS SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS. WE

CLASSIFY AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE DEBT INSTRUMENTS WITH REMAINING

WE ACCOUNT FOR COST BASIS LOAN PARTICIPATION NOTES AT AMORTIZED

COST AND CLASSIFY THEM AS SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS AND OTHER

LONG-TERM INVESTMENTS BASED ON STATED MATURITIES.

AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE

INVESTMENTS

INVESTMENTS THAT WE DESIGNATE AS

AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE ARE REPORTED AT FAIR VALUE, WITH UNREALIZED

GAINS AND LOSSES, NET OF TAX, RECORDED IN ACCUMULATED OTHER

AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE INVESTMENTS INCLUDE.



MARKETABLE DEBT INSTRUMENTS

WHEN THE INTEREST RATE

AND FOREIGN CURRENCY RISKS ARE NOT HEDGED AT INCEPTION OF THE

INVESTMENT OR WHEN OUR DESIGNATION FOR TRADING ASSETS IS NOT

MET. WE HOLD THESE DEBT INSTRUMENTS TO GENERATE A RETURN

COMMENSURATE WITH THREE-MONTH LIBOR. WE RECORD THE INTEREST

INCOME AND REALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES ON THE SALE OF THESE

INSTRUMENTS IN INTEREST AND OTHER, NET.



MARKETABLE EQUITY SECURITIES

WHEN THE INVESTMENTS

ARE CONSIDERED STRATEGIC IN NATURE AT THE TIME OF ORIGINAL

CLASSIFICATION OR THERE ARE BARRIERS TO MITIGATING EQUITY MARKET

RISK THROUGH THE SALE OR USE OF DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AT THE

TIME OF ORIGINAL CLASSIFICATION. WE ACQUIRE THESE EQUITY

INVESTMENTS FOR THE PROMOTION OF BUSINESS AND STRATEGIC

OBJECTIVES. TO THE EXTENT THAT THESE INVESTMENTS CONTINUE TO

HAVE STRATEGIC VALUE, WE TYPICALLY DO NOT ATTEMPT TO REDUCE OR

ELIMINATE THE INHERENT EQUITY MARKET RISKS THROUGH HEDGING

ACTIVITIES. WE RECORD THE REALIZED GAINS OR LOSSES ON THE SALE

OTHER EQUITY INVESTMENTS, NET.

NON-MARKETABLE



EQUITY METHOD INVESTMENTS

RESULTING FROM INVESTEE CAPITAL TRANSACTIONS, ADJUSTMENTS TO

RECOGNIZE CERTAIN DIFFERENCES BETWEEN OUR CARRYING VALUE AND OUR

OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY

IMPAIRMENT

ALL OF OUR AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE

INVESTMENTS AND NON-MARKETABLE AND OTHER EQUITY INVESTMENTS ARE

SUBJECT TO A PERIODIC IMPAIRMENT REVIEW. INVESTMENTS ARE

CONSIDERED TO BE IMPAIRED WHEN A DECLINE IN FAIR VALUE IS JUDGED

TO BE OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY, FOR THE FOLLOWING INVESTMENTS.



MARKETABLE EQUITY SECURITIES

WHEN THE RESULTING FAIR

VALUE IS SIGNIFICANTLY BELOW COST BASIS

AND/OR

THE

SIGNIFICANT DECLINE HAS LASTED FOR AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF TIME.

THE EVALUATION THAT WE USE TO DETERMINE WHETHER A MARKETABLE

EQUITY SECURITY IS OTHER THAN TEMPORARILY IMPAIRED IS BASED ON

THE SPECIFIC FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES PRESENT AT THE TIME OF

ASSESSMENT, WHICH INCLUDE THE CONSIDERATION OF GENERAL MARKET

CONDITIONS, THE DURATION AND EXTENT TO WHICH THE FAIR VALUE IS

BELOW COST, AND OUR INTENT AND ABILITY TO HOLD THE INVESTMENT

FOR A SUFFICIENT PERIOD OF TIME TO ALLOW FOR RECOVERY IN VALUE

IN THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. WE ALSO CONSIDER SPECIFIC ADVERSE

CONDITIONS RELATED TO THE FINANCIAL HEALTH OF AND BUSINESS

OUTLOOK FOR THE INVESTEE, INCLUDING INDUSTRY AND SECTOR

WHETHER A MARKETABLE DEBT INSTRUMENT IS OTHER THAN TEMPORARILY

IMPAIRED IS BASED ON THE SPECIFIC FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES

PRESENT AT THE TIME OF ASSESSMENT, WHICH INCLUDE THE

CONSIDERATION OF THE FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY OF THE

ISSUER, THE ISSUERS CREDIT RATING, SPECIFIC EVENTS THAT

DERIVATIVE

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

OUR PRIMARY OBJECTIVE FOR HOLDING

DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS IS TO MANAGE CURRENCY EXCHANGE

RATE RISK AND INTEREST RATE RISK, AND TO A LESSER EXTENT, EQUITY

MARKET RISK AND COMMODITY PRICE RISK. OUR DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL

INSTRUMENTS ARE RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE AND ARE INCLUDED IN OTHER

CURRENT ASSETS, OTHER LONG-TERM ASSETS, OTHER ACCRUED

LIABILITIES, OR OTHER LONG-TERM LIABILITIES. DERIVATIVE

INSTRUMENTS RECORDED AS ASSETS TOTALED $173 MILLION AS OF

DECEMBER 27, 2008 ($118 MILLION AS OF

DECEMBER 29, 2007). DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS RECORDED AS

LIABILITIES TOTALED $299 MILLION AS OF DECEMBER 27,

2008 ($130 MILLION AS OF DECEMBER 29, 2007). FOR

FURTHER DISCUSSION OF OUR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS, SEE

NOTE 8: DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS.

OUR ACCOUNTING POLICIES FOR

DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS ARE BASED ON WHETHER THEY MEET

THE CRITERIA FOR DESIGNATION AS CASH FLOW OR FAIR VALUE HEDGES.

A DESIGNATED HEDGE OF THE EXPOSURE TO VARIABILITY IN THE FUTURE

CASH FLOWS OF AN ASSET OR A LIABILITY, OR OF A FORECASTED

TRANSACTION, IS REFERRED TO AS A CASH FLOW HEDGE. A DESIGNATED

HEDGE OF THE EXPOSURE TO CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE OF AN ASSET OR A

LIABILITY, OR OF AN UNRECOGNIZED FIRM COMMITMENT, IS REFERRED TO

AS A FAIR VALUE HEDGE. THE CRITERIA FOR DESIGNATING A DERIVATIVE

AS A HEDGE INCLUDE THE ASSESSMENT OF THE INSTRUMENTS

EFFECTIVENESS IN RISK REDUCTION, MATCHING OF THE DERIVATIVE

INSTRUMENT TO ITS UNDERLYING TRANSACTION, AND THE PROBABILITY

THAT THE UNDERLYING TRANSACTION WILL OCCUR. FOR DERIVATIVES WITH

CASH FLOW HEDGE ACCOUNTING DESIGNATION, WE REPORT THE AFTER-TAX

GAIN OR LOSS FROM THE EFFECTIVE PORTION OF THE HEDGE AS A

COMPONENT OF ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS) AND

RECLASSIFY IT INTO EARNINGS IN THE SAME PERIOD OR PERIODS IN

WHICH THE HEDGED TRANSACTION AFFECTS EARNINGS, AND WITHIN THE

SAME INCOME STATEMENT LINE ITEM AS THE IMPACT OF THE HEDGED

TRANSACTION. FOR DERIVATIVES WITH FAIR VALUE HEDGE ACCOUNTING

DESIGNATION, WE RECOGNIZE GAINS OR LOSSES FROM THE CHANGE IN

FAIR VALUE OF THESE DERIVATIVES, AS WELL AS THE OFFSETTING

CHANGE IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE UNDERLYING HEDGED ITEM, IN

EARNINGS. DERIVATIVES THAT WE DESIGNATE AS HEDGES ARE CLASSIFIED

IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS IN THE SAME SECTION

AS THE UNDERLYING ITEM, PRIMARILY WITHIN CASH FLOWS FROM

OPERATING ACTIVITIES.

WE RECOGNIZE GAINS AND LOSSES FROM

CHANGES IN FAIR VALUES OF DERIVATIVES THAT ARE NOT DESIGNATED AS

HEDGES FOR ACCOUNTING PURPOSES WITHIN THE INCOME STATEMENT LINE

ITEM MOST CLOSELY ASSOCIATED WITH THE ECONOMIC UNDERLYING,

PRIMARILY IN INTEREST AND OTHER, NET, EXCEPT FOR EQUITY-RELATED

GAINS OR LOSSES, WHICH WE PRIMARILY RECORD IN GAINS (LOSSES) ON

OTHER EQUITY INVESTMENTS, NET. DERIVATIVES NOT DESIGNATED AS

HEDGES ARE CLASSIFIED IN CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES.

AS PART OF OUR STRATEGIC

INVESTMENT PROGRAM, WE ALSO ACQUIRE EQUITY DERIVATIVE

INSTRUMENTS, SUCH AS WARRANTS AND EQUITY CONVERSION RIGHTS

ASSOCIATED WITH DEBT INSTRUMENTS, WHICH WE DO NOT DESIGNATE AS

HEDGING INSTRUMENTS. WE RECOGNIZE THE GAINS OR LOSSES FROM

CHANGES IN FAIR VALUES OF THESE EQUITY DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS IN

GAINS (LOSSES) ON OTHER EQUITY INVESTMENTS, NET.

MEASUREMENT

OF EFFECTIVENESS



EFFECTIVENESS FOR FORWARDS

IS GENERALLY MEASURED

BY COMPARING THE CUMULATIVE CHANGE IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE

HEDGE CONTRACT WITH THE CUMULATIVE CHANGE IN THE PRESENT VALUE

OF THE FORECASTED CASH FLOWS OF THE HEDGED ITEM. FOR CURRENCY

FORWARD CONTRACTS USED IN CASH FLOW HEDGING STRATEGIES RELATED

TO CAPITAL PURCHASES, FORWARD POINTS ARE EXCLUDED, AND

EFFECTIVENESS IS MEASURED USING SPOT RATES TO VALUE BOTH THE

HEDGE CONTRACT AND THE HEDGED ITEM. FOR CURRENCY FORWARD

CONTRACTS USED IN CASH FLOW HEDGING STRATEGIES RELATED TO

OPERATING EXPENDITURES, FORWARD POINTS ARE INCLUDED AND

EFFECTIVENESS IS MEASURED USING FORWARD RATES TO VALUE BOTH THE

HEDGE CONTRACT AND THE HEDGED ITEM.



EFFECTIVENESS FOR CURRENCY

OPTIONS AND EQUITY OPTIONS WITH HEDGE ACCOUNTING DESIGNATION

IS GENERALLY MEASURED

BY COMPARING THE CUMULATIVE CHANGE IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE

HEDGE CONTRACT WITH THE CUMULATIVE CHANGE IN THE FAIR VALUE OF

AN OPTION INSTRUMENT REPRESENTING THE HEDGED RISKS IN THE HEDGED

ITEM FOR CASH FLOW HEDGES. FOR FAIR VALUE HEDGES, TIME VALUE IS

EXCLUDED AND EFFECTIVENESS IS MEASURED BASED ON SPOT RATES TO

VALUE BOTH THE HEDGE CONTRACT AND THE HEDGED ITEM.



EFFECTIVENESS FOR INTEREST RATE

SWAPS

IS GENERALLY

MEASURED BY COMPARING THE CHANGE IN FAIR VALUE OF THE HEDGED

ITEM WITH THE CHANGE IN FAIR VALUE OF THE INTEREST RATE SWAP.

IF A CASH FLOW HEDGE WERE

DISCONTINUED BECAUSE IT WAS NO LONGER PROBABLE THAT THE ORIGINAL

HEDGED TRANSACTION WOULD OCCUR AS ANTICIPATED, THE UNREALIZED

GAIN OR LOSS ON THE RELATED DERIVATIVE WOULD BE RECLASSIFIED

INTO EARNINGS. SUBSEQUENT GAINS OR LOSSES ON THE RELATED

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENT WOULD BE RECOGNIZED IN INCOME IN EACH

PERIOD UNTIL THE INSTRUMENT MATURES, IS TERMINATED, IS

RE-DESIGNATED AS A QUALIFIED HEDGE, OR IS SOLD. ANY INEFFECTIVE

PORTION OF BOTH CASH FLOW AND FAIR VALUE HEDGES, AS WELL AS

AMOUNTS EXCLUDED FROM THE ASSESSMENT OF EFFECTIVENESS, IS

RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS IN INTEREST AND OTHER, NET.

SECURITIES

LENDING

WE MAY ENTER INTO SECURITIES

LENDING AGREEMENTS WITH FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, GENERALLY TO

FACILITATE HEDGING AND CERTAIN INVESTMENT TRANSACTIONS. SELECTED

SECURITIES MAY BE LOANED, SECURED BY COLLATERAL IN THE FORM OF

CASH OR SECURITIES. THE LOANED SECURITIES CONTINUE TO BE CARRIED

AS INVESTMENT ASSETS ON OUR CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS. CASH

COLLATERAL IS RECORDED AS AN ASSET WITH A CORRESPONDING

LIABILITY. FOR LENDING AGREEMENTS COLLATERALIZED BY SECURITIES,

WE DO NOT RECORD THE COLLATERAL AS AN ASSET OR A LIABILITY,

UNLESS THE COLLATERAL IS REPLEDGED.

INVENTORIES

WE COMPUTE INVENTORY COST ON A

CURRENTLY ADJUSTED STANDARD BASIS (WHICH APPROXIMATES ACTUAL

COST ON AN AVERAGE OR

FIRST-IN,

FIRST-OUT BASIS). THE VALUATION OF INVENTORY REQUIRES US TO

ESTIMATE OBSOLETE OR EXCESS INVENTORY AS WELL AS INVENTORY THAT

IS NOT OF SALEABLE QUALITY. THE DETERMINATION OF OBSOLETE OR

EXCESS INVENTORY REQUIRES US TO ESTIMATE THE FUTURE DEMAND FOR

OUR PRODUCTS. IT IS REASONABLY POSSIBLE THAT OUR ESTIMATE OF

FUTURE DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS COULD CHANGE IN THE NEAR TERM AND

RESULT IN ADDITIONAL INVENTORY WRITE-OFFS, WHICH WOULD

NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR GROSS MARGIN. INVENTORY IN EXCESS OF

SALEABLE AMOUNTS IS NOT VALUED, AND THE REMAINING INVENTORY IS

VALUED AT THE LOWER OF COST OR MARKET. INVENTORIES AT FISCAL

WE REGULARLY PERFORM REVIEWS IF FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE

THAT THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF ASSETS MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE OR

USE BY COMPARING THE PROJECTED UNDISCOUNTED NET CASH FLOWS

ASSOCIATED WITH THE RELATED ASSET OR GROUP OF ASSETS OVER THEIR

GOODWILL

WE RECORD GOODWILL WHEN THE

PURCHASE PRICE OF AN ACQUISITION EXCEEDS THE ESTIMATED FAIR

VALUE OF THE NET IDENTIFIED TANGIBLE AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS

ACQUIRED. EACH YEAR DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER, WE PERFORM AN

IMPAIRMENT REVIEW FOR EACH REPORTING UNIT USING A FAIR VALUE

OR AN OPERATION ONE LEVEL BELOW AN OPERATING SEGMENT, REFERRED

TO AS A COMPONENT. IN DETERMINING THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE

REPORTING UNIT, WE MAKE AN ALLOCATION OF OUR MANUFACTURING AND

ASSEMBLY AND TEST ASSETS BECAUSE OF THE INTERCHANGEABLE NATURE

OF OUR MANUFACTURING AND ASSEMBLY AND TEST CAPACITY. WE BASE

THIS ALLOCATION ON EACH REPORTING UNITS RELATIVE

PERCENTAGE UTILIZATION OF THE MANUFACTURING AND ASSEMBLY AND

TEST ASSETS. IN THE EVENT THAT AN INDIVIDUAL BUSINESS WITHIN A

REPORTING UNIT IS DIVESTED, WE ALLOCATE GOODWILL TO THAT

BUSINESS BASED ON ITS FAIR VALUE RELATIVE TO ITS REPORTING UNIT.

INTANGIBLE ASSETS

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY ASSETS

PRIMARILY REPRESENT RIGHTS ACQUIRED UNDER TECHNOLOGY LICENSES

ACQUISITION-RELATED DEVELOPED TECHNOLOGY ON A STRAIGHT-LINE

BASIS OVER APPROXIMATELY 4 YEARS. WE AMORTIZE OTHER INTANGIBLE

ASSETS OVER 4 YEARS. WE CLASSIFY ALL IDENTIFIED INTANGIBLE

ASSETS WITHIN OTHER LONG-TERM ASSETS. IN THE QUARTER FOLLOWING

THE PERIOD IN WHICH IDENTIFIED INTANGIBLE ASSETS BECOME FULLY

AMORTIZED, THE FULLY AMORTIZED BALANCES ARE REMOVED FROM THE

GROSS ASSET AND ACCUMULATED AMORTIZATION AMOUNTS. FOR FURTHER

WE PERFORM A QUARTERLY REVIEW OF

IDENTIFIED INTANGIBLE ASSETS TO DETERMINE IF FACTS AND

CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THAT THE USEFUL LIFE IS SHORTER THAN WE

HAD ORIGINALLY ESTIMATED OR THAT THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF ASSETS

MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE. IF SUCH FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES EXIST,

WE ASSESS THE RECOVERABILITY OF IDENTIFIED INTANGIBLE ASSETS BY

COMPARING THE PROJECTED UNDISCOUNTED NET CASH FLOWS ASSOCIATED

WITH THE RELATED ASSET OR GROUP OF ASSETS OVER THEIR REMAINING

LIVES AGAINST THEIR RESPECTIVE CARRYING AMOUNTS. IMPAIRMENTS, IF

ANY, ARE BASED ON THE EXCESS OF THE CARRYING AMOUNT OVER THE

FAIR VALUE OF THOSE ASSETS.

PRODUCT

WARRANTY

WE GENERALLY SELL PRODUCTS WITH A

LIMITED WARRANTY ON PRODUCT QUALITY AND A LIMITED

INDEMNIFICATION FOR CUSTOMERS AGAINST INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

INFRINGEMENT CLAIMS RELATED TO OUR PRODUCTS. WE ACCRUE FOR KNOWN

WARRANTY AND INDEMNIFICATION ISSUES IF A LOSS IS PROBABLE AND

CAN BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED, AND ACCRUE FOR ESTIMATED INCURRED

BUT UNIDENTIFIED ISSUES BASED ON HISTORICAL ACTIVITY. THE

ACCRUAL AND THE RELATED EXPENSE FOR KNOWN ISSUES WERE NOT

SIGNIFICANT DURING THE PERIODS PRESENTED. DUE TO PRODUCT TESTING

AND THE SHORT TIME TYPICALLY BETWEEN PRODUCT SHIPMENT AND THE

DETECTION AND CORRECTION OF PRODUCT FAILURES, AND CONSIDERING

THE HISTORICAL RATE OF PAYMENTS ON INDEMNIFICATION CLAIMS, THE

ACCRUAL AND RELATED EXPENSE FOR ESTIMATED INCURRED BUT

UNIDENTIFIED ISSUES WERE NOT SIGNIFICANT DURING THE PERIODS

PRESENTED.

REVENUE

RECOGNITION

WE RECOGNIZE NET REVENUE WHEN THE

EARNINGS PROCESS IS COMPLETE, AS EVIDENCED BY AN AGREEMENT WITH

THE CUSTOMER, TRANSFER OF TITLE, AND ACCEPTANCE, IF APPLICABLE,

AS WELL AS FIXED PRICING AND PROBABLE COLLECTIBILITY. WE RECORD

PRICING ALLOWANCES, INCLUDING DISCOUNTS BASED ON CONTRACTUAL

ARRANGEMENTS WITH CUSTOMERS, WHEN WE RECOGNIZE REVENUE AS A

REDUCTION TO BOTH ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND NET REVENUE. BECAUSE

OF FREQUENT SALES PRICE REDUCTIONS AND RAPID TECHNOLOGY

OBSOLESCENCE IN THE INDUSTRY, WE DEFER THE REVENUE AND RELATED

COSTS OF SALES FROM SALES MADE TO DISTRIBUTORS UNDER AGREEMENTS

ALLOWING PRICE PROTECTION

AND/OR

RIGHT

OF RETURN UNTIL THE DISTRIBUTORS SELL THE MERCHANDISE. THE RIGHT

OF RETURN GRANTED GENERALLY CONSISTS OF A STOCK ROTATION PROGRAM

IN WHICH DISTRIBUTORS ARE ABLE TO EXCHANGE CERTAIN PRODUCTS

BASED ON THE NUMBER OF QUALIFIED PURCHASES MADE BY THE

DISTRIBUTOR. UNDER THE PRICE PROTECTION PROGRAM, WE GIVE

DISTRIBUTORS CREDITS FOR THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE ORIGINAL

PRICE PAID AND THE CURRENT PRICE THAT WE OFFER. WE RECORD THE

NET DEFERRED INCOME FROM SALES TO DISTRIBUTORS ON OUR BALANCE

SHEET AS DEFERRED INCOME ON SHIPMENTS TO DISTRIBUTORS. WE

INCLUDE SHIPPING CHARGES BILLED TO CUSTOMERS IN NET REVENUE, AND

INCLUDE THE RELATED SHIPPING COSTS IN COST OF SALES.

ADOPTED THE PROVISIONS OF SFAS NO. 123 (REVISED 2004),

SHARE-BASED PAYMENT (SFAS NO. 123(R)). SFAS NO.

123(R) REQUIRES EMPLOYEE EQUITY AWARDS TO BE ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER

THE FAIR VALUE METHOD. ACCORDINGLY, WE MEASURE SHARE-BASED

COMPENSATION AT THE GRANT DATE BASED ON THE FAIR VALUE OF THE

AWARD.

UNDER THE MODIFIED PROSPECTIVE

METHOD OF ADOPTION FOR SFAS NO. 123(R), THE COMPENSATION COST

THAT WE RECOGNIZED BEGINNING IN 2006 INCLUDES COMPENSATION COST

FOR ALL EQUITY INCENTIVE AWARDS GRANTED PRIOR TO BUT NOT YET

VESTED AS OF JANUARY 1, 2006, BASED ON THE GRANT-DATE FAIR VALUE

ESTIMATED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE ORIGINAL PROVISIONS OF SFAS NO.

GRANTED SUBSEQUENT TO JANUARY 1, 2006, BASED ON THE GRANT-DATE

FAIR VALUE ESTIMATED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE PROVISIONS OF SFAS

RECOGNIZE SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION OVER THE SERVICE PERIOD OF

THE AWARD. UPON EXERCISE, CANCELLATION, FORFEITURE, OR

EXPIRATION OF STOCK OPTIONS, OR UPON VESTING OR FORFEITURE OF

RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS, WE ELIMINATE DEFERRED TAX ASSETS FOR

NO. 87, 88, 106, AND 132(R) (SFAS NO. 158). SFAS NO. 158

REQUIRES THAT THE FUNDED STATUS OF DEFINED-BENEFIT

POSTRETIREMENT PLANS BE RECOGNIZED ON OUR CONSOLIDATED BALANCE

SHEETS AND THAT CHANGES IN THE FUNDED STATUS BE REFLECTED IN

OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME. SFAS NO. 158 ALSO REQUIRES THAT THE

MEASUREMENT DATE OF THE PLANS FUNDED STATUS BE THE SAME AS

OUR FISCAL YEAR-END. PRIOR TO ADOPTING THE PROVISIONS OF SFAS

NO. 158, THE MEASUREMENT DATE FOR ALL

NON-U.S.

PLANS WAS OUR FISCAL YEAR-END, AND THE MEASUREMENT DATE FOR THE

U.S. PLAN WAS NOVEMBER. THEREFORE, THE CHANGE IN MEASUREMENT

DATE HAD AN INSIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE PROJECTED BENEFIT

OBLIGATION AND ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS).

AND FOR ALL NON-FINANCIAL ASSETS AND NON-FINANCIAL LIABILITIES

RECOGNIZED OR DISCLOSED AT FAIR VALUE IN THE FINANCIAL

SFAS NO. 159 ALSO REQUIRES CASH

FLOWS FROM PURCHASES, SALES, AND MATURITIES OF TRADING

PURPOSE OF OUR TRADING ASSETS AND DETERMINED THAT OUR MARKETABLE

DEBT INSTRUMENTS WILL BE CLASSIFIED ON THE STATEMENT OF CASH

FLOWS AS INVESTING ACTIVITIES, AS THEY ARE HELD WITH THE PURPOSE

OF GENERATING RETURNS. OUR EQUITY SECURITIES OFFSETTING DEFERRED

LIABILITIES RELATED TO THE EQUITY MARKET RISK OF CERTAIN

DEFERRED COMPENSATION ARRANGEMENTS. SFAS NO. 159 DOES NOT ALLOW

FOR RETROSPECTIVE APPLICATION TO PERIODS PRIOR TO FISCAL YEAR

OF CREDIT-RISK-RELATED CONTINGENT FEATURES FOR DERIVATIVES. SFAS

NO. 161 DOES NOT CHANGE THE ACCOUNTING TREATMENT FOR DERIVATIVE

INSTRUMENTS. SFAS NO. 161 IS EFFECTIVE FOR US BEGINNING IN THE

FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL YEAR 2009.

IN MAY 2008, THE FASB ISSUED FSP

ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES BOARD (APB) OPINION

14-1,

ACCOUNTING FOR CONVERTIBLE DEBT INSTRUMENTS THAT MAY BE

SETTLED IN CASH UPON CONVERSION (INCLUDING PARTIAL CASH

SETTLEMENT) (FSP APB

14-1).

FSP

APB

14-1

REQUIRES RECOGNITION OF BOTH THE LIABILITY AND EQUITY COMPONENTS

OF CONVERTIBLE DEBT INSTRUMENTS WITH CASH SETTLEMENT FEATURES.

THE DEBT COMPONENT IS REQUIRED TO BE RECOGNIZED AT THE FAIR

VALUE OF A SIMILAR INSTRUMENT THAT DOES NOT HAVE AN ASSOCIATED

EQUITY COMPONENT. THE EQUITY COMPONENT IS RECOGNIZED AS THE

DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE PROCEEDS FROM THE ISSUANCE OF THE NOTE

AND THE FAIR VALUE OF THE LIABILITY. FSP APB

14-1

ALSO

REQUIRES AN ACCRETION OF THE RESULTING DEBT DISCOUNT OVER THE

EXPECTED LIFE OF THE DEBT. RETROSPECTIVE APPLICATION TO ALL

PERIODS PRESENTED IS REQUIRED. THIS STANDARD IS EFFECTIVE FOR US

BEGINNING IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL YEAR 2009 AND WILL

CHANGE THE ACCOUNTING FOR OUR JUNIOR SUBORDINATED CONVERTIBLE

DEBENTURES ISSUED IN 2005. THE ADOPTION OF FSP APB

14-1

IS

EXPECTED TO RESULT IN A DECREASE IN OUR LONG-TERM DEBT OF

APPROXIMATELY $700 MILLION; AN INCREASE IN OUR DEFERRED TAX

LIABILITY OF APPROXIMATELY $275 MILLION; AN INCREASE IN OUR

STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY OF APPROXIMATELY $450 MILLION; AND AN

INCREASE IN OUR NET PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT OF

APPROXIMATELY $25 MILLION AS OF THE BEGINNING OF THE FIRST

QUARTER OF FISCAL YEAR 2009. THE ADOPTION OF FSP APB

14-1

WILL

NOT RESULT IN A CHANGE TO OUR PRIOR-PERIOD CONSOLIDATED

STATEMENTS OF INCOME, AS THE INTEREST ASSOCIATED WITH OUR DEBT

ISSUANCES IS CAPITALIZED AND ADDED TO THE COST OF QUALIFIED

ASSETS.

IN DECEMBER 2008, THE FASB ISSUED

FSP 132(R)-1, EMPLOYERS DISCLOSURES ABOUT

POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLAN ASSETS (FSP 132(R)-1). FSP

132(R)-1 REQUIRES ADDITIONAL DISCLOSURES FOR PLAN ASSETS OF

DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION OR OTHER POSTRETIREMENT PLANS. THE

REQUIRED DISCLOSURES INCLUDE A DESCRIPTION OF OUR INVESTMENT

POLICIES AND STRATEGIES, THE FAIR VALUE OF EACH MAJOR CATEGORY

OF PLAN ASSETS, THE INPUTS AND VALUATION TECHNIQUES USED TO

MEASURE THE FAIR VALUE OF PLAN ASSETS, THE EFFECT OF FAIR VALUE

MEASUREMENTS USING SIGNIFICANT UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS ON CHANGES IN

PLAN ASSETS, AND THE SIGNIFICANT CONCENTRATIONS OF RISK WITHIN

PLAN ASSETS. FSP 132(R)-1 DOES NOT CHANGE THE ACCOUNTING

TREATMENT FOR POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS PLANS. FSP 132(R)-1 IS

EFFECTIVE FOR US FOR FISCAL YEAR 2009.

NOTE 3.

FAIR VALUE

OUR FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS ARE

CARRIED AT FAIR VALUE, EXCEPT FOR COST BASIS LOAN PARTICIPATION

NOTES, EQUITY METHOD AND COST METHOD INVESTMENTS, AND MOST OF

OUR LONG-TERM DEBT. SFAS NO. 157 DEFINES FAIR VALUE AS THE PRICE

THAT WOULD BE RECEIVED FROM SELLING AN ASSET OR PAID TO TRANSFER

A LIABILITY IN AN ORDERLY TRANSACTION BETWEEN MARKET

PARTICIPANTS AT THE MEASUREMENT DATE. WHEN DETERMINING FAIR

VALUE, WE CONSIDER THE PRINCIPAL OR MOST ADVANTAGEOUS MARKET IN

WHICH WE WOULD TRANSACT, AND WE CONSIDER ASSUMPTIONS THAT MARKET

PARTICIPANTS WOULD USE WHEN PRICING THE ASSET OR LIABILITY, SUCH

AS INHERENT RISK, TRANSFER RESTRICTIONS, AND RISK OF

NON-PERFORMANCE.

EXCEEDED THE CARRYING VALUE BY $14 MILLION. THE FAIR VALUE

OF OUR NON-MARKETABLE EQUITY INVESTMENTS EXCEEDED THE CARRYING

$100 MILLION, A MAJORITY OF WHICH WERE IN A CONTINUOUS

UNREALIZED LOSS POSITION FOR LESS THAN 12 MONTHS. THE FAIR

VALUE OF OUR NON-MARKETABLE EQUITY INVESTMENTS EXCEEDED THE

CARRYING VALUE BY APPROXIMATELY $600 MILLION AS OF

DECEMBER 29, 2007. THE FAIR VALUE OF THESE INVESTMENTS

TAKES INTO ACCOUNT THE MOVEMENTS OF THE EQUITY AND VENTURE

CAPITAL MARKETS AS WELL AS CHANGES IN THE INTEREST RATE

ENVIRONMENT, AND OTHER ECONOMIC VARIABLES.

THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR LONG-TERM

DEBT WAS APPROXIMATELY $280 MILLION LOWER THAN THE CARRYING

VALUE AS OF DECEMBER 27, 2008 (THE FAIR VALUE EXCEEDED THE

CARRYING VALUE BY APPROXIMATELY $65 MILLION AS OF

DECEMBER 29, 2007). THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR LONG-TERM DEBT

TAKES INTO CONSIDERATION CREDIT RATING CHANGES, EQUITY PRICE

MOVEMENTS, INTEREST RATE CHANGES, AND OTHER ECONOMIC VARIABLES.

FAIR

VALUE HIERARCHY

SFAS NO. 157 ESTABLISHES

THREE LEVELS OF INPUTS THAT MAY BE USED TO MEASURE FAIR VALUE.

LEVEL 1.

QUOTED

PRICES IN ACTIVE MARKETS FOR IDENTICAL ASSETS OR LIABILITIES.

LEVEL 1 ASSETS AND

LIABILITIES CONSIST OF CERTAIN OF OUR MONEY MARKET FUND DEPOSITS

AND MARKETABLE DEBT AND EQUITY INSTRUMENTS, INCLUDING EQUITY

SECURITIES OFFSETTING DEFERRED COMPENSATION, THAT ARE TRADED IN

AN ACTIVE MARKET WITH SUFFICIENT VOLUME AND FREQUENCY OF

TRANSACTIONS.

LEVEL 2.

OBSERVABLE

INPUTS OTHER THAN LEVEL 1 PRICES, SUCH AS QUOTED PRICES FOR

SIMILAR ASSETS OR LIABILITIES, QUOTED PRICES IN MARKETS WITH

INSUFFICIENT VOLUME OR INFREQUENT TRANSACTIONS (LESS ACTIVE

MARKETS), OR MODEL-DERIVED VALUATIONS IN WHICH ALL SIGNIFICANT

INPUTS ARE OBSERVABLE OR CAN BE DERIVED PRINCIPALLY FROM OR

CORROBORATED WITH OBSERVABLE MARKET DATA FOR SUBSTANTIALLY THE

FULL TERM OF THE ASSETS OR LIABILITIES.

LEVEL 2 ASSETS CONSIST OF

CERTAIN OF OUR MARKETABLE DEBT AND EQUITY INSTRUMENTS WITH

QUOTED MARKET PRICES THAT ARE TRADED IN LESS ACTIVE MARKETS OR

PRICED USING A QUOTED MARKET PRICE FOR SIMILAR INSTRUMENTS.

LEVEL 2 ASSETS ALSO INCLUDE MARKETABLE DEBT INSTRUMENTS

PRICED USING NON-BINDING MARKET CONSENSUS PRICES THAT CAN BE

CORROBORATED WITH OBSERVABLE MARKET DATA, MARKETABLE EQUITY

SECURITIES WITH SECURITY-SPECIFIC RESTRICTIONS THAT WOULD

TRANSFER TO THE BUYER, AS WELL AS DEBT INSTRUMENTS AND

DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS PRICED USING INPUTS THAT ARE OBSERVABLE IN

THE MARKET OR CAN BE DERIVED PRINCIPALLY FROM OR CORROBORATED

WITH OBSERVABLE MARKET DATA. MARKETABLE DEBT INSTRUMENTS IN THIS

CATEGORY GENERALLY INCLUDE COMMERCIAL PAPER, BANK TIME DEPOSITS,

MUNICIPAL BONDS, CERTAIN OF OUR MONEY MARKET FUND DEPOSITS, AND

A MAJORITY OF FLOATING-RATE NOTES AND CORPORATE BONDS.

LEVEL 3.

UNOBSERVABLE

INPUTS TO THE VALUATION METHODOLOGY THAT ARE SIGNIFICANT TO THE

MEASUREMENT OF THE FAIR VALUE OF ASSETS OR LIABILITIES.

LEVEL 3 ASSETS AND

LIABILITIES INCLUDE MARKETABLE DEBT INSTRUMENTS, NON-MARKETABLE

EQUITY INVESTMENTS, DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS, AND COMPANY-ISSUED

DEBT WHOSE VALUES ARE DETERMINED USING INPUTS THAT ARE BOTH

UNOBSERVABLE AND SIGNIFICANT TO THE VALUES OF THE INSTRUMENTS

BEING MEASURED. LEVEL 3 ASSETS ALSO INCLUDE MARKETABLE DEBT

INSTRUMENTS THAT ARE PRICED USING NON-BINDING MARKET CONSENSUS

PRICES OR NON-BINDING BROKER QUOTES THAT WE WERE UNABLE TO

CORROBORATE WITH OBSERVABLE MARKET DATA. MARKETABLE DEBT

INSTRUMENTS IN THIS CATEGORY GENERALLY INCLUDE ASSET-BACKED

ALL OF OUR LONG-TERM DEBT WAS

ELIGIBLE FOR THE FAIR VALUE OPTION ALLOWED BY

SFAS NO. 159 AS OF THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF THE STANDARD;

HOWEVER, WE ELECTED THE FAIR VALUE OPTION ONLY FOR THE BONDS

ISSUED IN 2007 BY THE INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY OF THE

CITY OF CHANDLER, ARIZONA (2007 ARIZONA BONDS). IN CONNECTION

WITH THE 2007 ARIZONA BONDS, WE ENTERED INTO AN INTEREST RATE

SWAP AGREEMENT THAT EFFECTIVELY CONVERTS THE FIXED RATE

OBLIGATION ON THE BONDS TO A FLOATING LIBOR-BASED RATE. AS A

RESULT, CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THIS DEBT ARE PRIMARILY

OFFSET BY CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE INTEREST RATE SWAP

AGREEMENT, WITHOUT THE NEED TO APPLY THE HEDGE ACCOUNTING

PROVISIONS OF SFAS NO. 133, ACCOUNTING FOR

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES

(SFAS NO. 133). WE ELECTED NOT TO ADOPT

SFAS NO. 159 FOR OUR ARIZONA BONDS ISSUED IN 2005,

SINCE THE BONDS WERE CARRIED AT AMORTIZED COST AND WERE NOT

ELIGIBLE TO APPLY THE HEDGE ACCOUNTING PROVISIONS OF

SFAS NO. 133 DUE TO THE USE OF NON-DERIVATIVE HEDGING

INSTRUMENTS. THE 2007 ARIZONA BONDS ARE INCLUDED WITHIN THE

LONG-TERM DEBT BALANCE ON OUR CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS. AS OF

DECEMBER 27, 2008 AND DECEMBER 29, 2007, NO OTHER

LONG-TERM DEBT INSTRUMENTS WERE SIMILAR TO THE INSTRUMENT FOR

WHICH WE HAVE ELECTED THE SFAS NO. 159 FAIR VALUE

TREATMENT.

THE FAIR VALUE OF THE 2007 ARIZONA

BONDS APPROXIMATED ITS CARRYING VALUE AT THE TIME WE ELECTED THE

FAIR VALUE OPTION UNDER SFAS NO. 159. AS SUCH, WE DID

NOT RECORD A CUMULATIVE-EFFECT ADJUSTMENT TO THE BEGINNING

BALANCE OF RETAINED EARNINGS OR TO THE DEFERRED TAX LIABILITY.

AS OF DECEMBER 27, 2008, THE FAIR VALUE OF THE 2007 ARIZONA

BONDS DID NOT SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFER FROM THE CONTRACTUAL

PRINCIPAL BALANCE. THE FAIR VALUE OF THE 2007 ARIZONA BONDS WAS

DETERMINED USING INPUTS THAT ARE OBSERVABLE IN THE MARKET OR

THAT CAN BE DERIVED FROM OR CORROBORATED WITH OBSERVABLE MARKET

DATA AS WELL AS SIGNIFICANT UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS. GAINS AND

LOSSES ON THE 2007 ARIZONA BONDS ARE RECORDED IN INTEREST AND

OTHER, NET ON THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME. WE

CAPITALIZE INTEREST ASSOCIATED WITH THE 2007 ARIZONA BONDS. WE

ADD CAPITALIZED INTEREST TO THE COST OF QUALIFIED ASSETS AND

AMORTIZE IT OVER THE ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES OF THE ASSETS.

OUR CARRYING VALUE AS OF DECEMBER 27, 2008 DID NOT EQUAL

OUR FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT AT THE TIME OF IMPAIRMENT DUE TO THE

SUBSEQUENT RECOGNITION OF EQUITY METHOD ADJUSTMENTS.

A PORTION OF OUR NON-MARKETABLE

EQUITY INVESTMENTS WERE MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE DURING 2008 DUE

TO EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES WE IDENTIFIED THAT SIGNIFICANTLY

IMPACTED THE FAIR VALUE OF THESE INVESTMENTS, RESULTING IN

OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENT CHARGES.

DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2008,

WE RECORDED A $762 MILLION IMPAIRMENT CHARGE ON OUR

INVESTMENT IN CLEARWIRE COMMUNICATIONS, LLC (CLEARWIRE

LLC) TO WRITE DOWN OUR INVESTMENT TO ITS FAIR VALUE,

PRIMARILY DUE TO THE FAIR VALUE BEING SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER THAN

THE COST BASIS OF OUR INVESTMENT. THE IMPAIRMENT CHARGE WAS

INCLUDED IN GAINS (LOSSES) ON EQUITY METHOD INVESTMENTS, NET ON

THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME. WE DETERMINE THE FAIR

VALUE OF OUR INVESTMENT IN CLEARWIRE LLC PRIMARILY USING THE

QUOTED PRICES FOR ITS PARENT COMPANY, THE NEW CLEARWIRE

CORPORATION. THE EFFECTS OF ADJUSTING THE QUOTED PRICE FOR

PREMIUMS THAT WE BELIEVE MARKET PARTICIPANTS WOULD CONSIDER FOR

CLEARWIRE LLC, SUCH AS TAX BENEFITS AND VOTING RIGHTS ASSOCIATED

WITH OUR INVESTMENT, WERE MOSTLY OFFSET BY THE EFFECTS OF

DISCOUNTS TO THE FAIR VALUE, SUCH AS THOSE DUE TO TRANSFER

RESTRICTIONS, LACK OF LIQUIDITY, AND DIFFERENCES IN DIVIDEND

RIGHTS THAT ARE INCLUDED IN THE VALUE OF THE NEW CLEARWIRE

CORPORATION STOCK. WE CLASSIFIED OUR INVESTMENT IN CLEARWIRE LLC

AS LEVEL 2, AS THE UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS TO THE VALUATION

METHODOLOGY WERE NOT SIGNIFICANT TO THE MEASUREMENT OF FAIR

VALUE. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT CLEARWIRE, SEE

WE RECORDED A $250 MILLION

IMPAIRMENT CHARGE ON OUR INVESTMENT IN NUMONYX B.V. DURING THE

THIRD QUARTER OF 2008 TO WRITE DOWN OUR INVESTMENT TO ITS FAIR

VALUE. ESTIMATES FOR REVENUE, EARNINGS, AND FUTURE CASH FLOWS

WERE REVISED LOWER DUE TO A GENERAL DECLINE IN THE NOR FLASH

MEMORY MARKET SEGMENT. WE MEASURE THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR

INVESTMENT IN NUMONYX USING A COMBINATION OF THE INCOME APPROACH

AND THE MARKET APPROACH. THE INCOME APPROACH INCLUDED THE USE OF

A WEIGHTED AVERAGE OF MULTIPLE DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW SCENARIOS OF

NUMONYX, WHICH REQUIRED THE USE OF UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS,

INCLUDING ASSUMPTIONS OF PROJECTED REVENUE, EXPENSES, CAPITAL

SPENDING, AND OTHER COSTS, AS WELL AS A DISCOUNT RATE CALCULATED

BASED ON THE RISK PROFILE OF THE FLASH MEMORY MARKET SEGMENT.

THE MARKET APPROACH INCLUDED USING FINANCIAL METRICS AND RATIOS

OF COMPARABLE PUBLIC COMPANIES. THE IMPAIRMENT CHARGE WAS

INCLUDED IN GAINS (LOSSES) ON EQUITY METHOD INVESTMENTS, NET ON

THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME.

WE ALSO MEASURED OTHER

NON-MARKETABLE EQUITY INVESTMENTS AT FAIR VALUE DURING 2008 WHEN

WE RECOGNIZED OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENT CHARGES. WE

CLASSIFIED THESE IMPAIRED NON-MARKETABLE EQUITY INVESTMENTS AS

LEVEL 3, AS WE USE UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS TO THE VALUATION

METHODOLOGY THAT ARE SIGNIFICANT TO THE FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT,

AND THE VALUATION REQUIRES MANAGEMENT JUDGMENT DUE TO THE

ABSENCE OF QUOTED MARKET PRICES AND INHERENT LACK OF LIQUIDITY.

WE CALCULATED THESE FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS USING THE MARKET

APPROACH

AND/OR

THE

INCOME APPROACH. THE MARKET APPROACH INCLUDES THE USE OF

FINANCIAL METRICS AND RATIOS OF COMPARABLE PUBLIC COMPANIES. THE

SELECTION OF COMPARABLE COMPANIES REQUIRES MANAGEMENT JUDGMENT

AND IS BASED ON A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING COMPARABLE

COMPANIES SIZES, GROWTH RATES, PRODUCTS AND SERVICES

LINES, DEVELOPMENT STAGE, AND OTHER RELEVANT FACTORS. THE INCOME

APPROACH INCLUDES THE USE OF A DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW MODEL, WHICH

REQUIRES THE FOLLOWING SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES FOR THE INVESTEE.

REVENUE, BASED ON ASSUMED MARKET SEGMENT SIZE AND ASSUMED MARKET

SEGMENT SHARE; ESTIMATED COSTS; AND APPROPRIATE DISCOUNT RATES

BASED ON THE RISK PROFILE OF COMPARABLE COMPANIES. ESTIMATES OF

MARKET SEGMENT SIZE, MARKET SEGMENT SHARE, AND COSTS ARE

DEVELOPED BY THE INVESTEE

AND/OR

INTEL

USING HISTORICAL DATA AND AVAILABLE MARKET DATA. THE VALUATION

OF OUR OTHER NON-MARKETABLE EQUITY INVESTMENTS ALSO TAKES INTO

ACCOUNT MOVEMENTS OF THE EQUITY AND VENTURE CAPITAL MARKETS,

RECENT FINANCING ACTIVITIES BY THE INVESTEES, CHANGES IN THE

INTEREST RATE ENVIRONMENT, THE INVESTEES CAPITAL

STRUCTURE, LIQUIDATION PREFERENCES FOR THE INVESTEES

CAPITAL, AND OTHER ECONOMIC VARIABLES. THE VALUATION OF SOME OF

OUR INVESTMENTS IN THE WIRELESS CONNECTIVITY MARKET SEGMENT WAS

BASED ON THE INCOME APPROACH TO DETERMINE THE VALUE OF THE

INVESTEES SPECTRUM LICENSES, TRANSMISSION TOWERS, AND

CUSTOMER LISTS.

AS OF DECEMBER 27, 2008, THE

UNREALIZED LOSSES ON OUR AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE INVESTMENTS

REPRESENTED AN INSIGNIFICANT AMOUNT IN RELATION TO OUR TOTAL

AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE PORTFOLIO. SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR

UNREALIZED LOSSES ON OUR AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE MARKETABLE DEBT

UNSTABLE CREDIT ENVIRONMENT THAT RESULTED IN A DECREASE IN THE

IMFT/IMFS

MICRON AND INTEL FORMED IM FLASH

TECHNOLOGIES, LLC (IMFT) IN JANUARY 2006 AND IM FLASH SINGAPORE,

LLP (IMFS) IN FEBRUARY 2007. WE ESTABLISHED THESE JOINT VENTURES

TO MANUFACTURE NAND FLASH MEMORY PRODUCTS FOR MICRON AND INTEL.

INTEL OWNS A 49% INTEREST IN EACH OF THESE VENTURES. OUR

INVESTMENTS WERE $1.7 BILLION IN IMFT AND $329 MILLION

IN IMFS AS OF DECEMBER 27, 2008 ($2.2 BILLION IN IMFT

AND $146 MILLION IN IMFS AS OF DECEMBER 29, 2007). OUR

INVESTMENTS IN THESE VENTURES ARE CLASSIFIED WITHIN OTHER

LONG-TERM ASSETS. DURING 2008, IMFT RETURNED $298 MILLION

TO INTEL, AND THAT AMOUNT IS REFLECTED AS A RETURN OF EQUITY

METHOD INVESTMENT WITHIN INVESTING ACTIVITIES ON THE

CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS.

AS PART OF THE INITIAL CAPITAL

CONTRIBUTION TO IMFT, WE PAID $615 MILLION IN CASH AND

ISSUED $581 MILLION IN NON-INTEREST-BEARING NOTES. DURING

2006, WE PAID THE ENTIRE BALANCE OF $581 MILLION TO SETTLE

THE NON-INTEREST-BEARING NOTES, WHICH HAS BEEN REFLECTED AS A

FINANCING ACTIVITY ON THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS.

AT INCEPTION, MICRON CONTRIBUTED ASSETS VALUED AT

$995 MILLION AND $250 MILLION IN CASH IN EXCHANGE FOR

A 51% INTEREST. IN ADDITION, WE CONTRIBUTED APPROXIMATELY

$1.3 BILLION OVER THE PAST THREE YEARS PURSUANT TO THE

TERMS OF THE ORIGINAL AGREEMENT.

INITIAL PRODUCTION FROM IMFT BEGAN

IN EARLY 2006. OUR PORTION OF IMFT COSTS, PRIMARILY RELATED TO

PRODUCT PURCHASES AND

START-UP,

WAS APPROXIMATELY $1.1 BILLION DURING 2008 (APPROXIMATELY

$790 MILLION DURING 2007 AND $300 MILLION DURING

2006). THE AMOUNT DUE TO IMFT FOR PRODUCT PURCHASES AND SERVICES

PROVIDED WAS APPROXIMATELY $190 MILLION AS OF

DECEMBER 27, 2008 AND APPROXIMATELY $130 MILLION AS OF

DECEMBER 29, 2007. COSTS THAT INTEL AND MICRON HAVE

INCURRED FOR PRODUCT AND PROCESS DEVELOPMENT RELATED TO IMFT ARE

GENERALLY SPLIT EVENLY BETWEEN INTEL AND MICRON AND ARE

GENERALLY CLASSIFIED IN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT.

IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2008,

MANAGEMENT APPROVED A PLAN WITH MICRON TO DISCONTINUE THE SUPPLY

OF NAND FLASH MEMORY FROM THE 200MM FACILITY WITHIN THE IMFT

MANUFACTURING NETWORK. THE AGREEMENT RESULTED IN A

$215 MILLION RESTRUCTURING CHARGE PRIMARILY RELATED TO THE

IMFT 200MM SUPPLY AGREEMENT. THE RESTRUCTURING CHARGE RESULTED

IN A REDUCTION OF OUR INVESTMENT IN IMFT OF $184 MILLION, A

CASH PAYMENT TO MICRON OF $24 MILLION, AND OTHER CASH

PAYMENTS OF $7 MILLION.

SUBJECT TO CERTAIN CONDITIONS, WE

ORIGINALLY AGREED TO CONTRIBUTE UP TO APPROXIMATELY

$1.7 BILLION FOR IMFS IN THE THREE YEARS FOLLOWING THE

INITIAL CAPITAL CONTRIBUTIONS, OF WHICH OUR MAXIMUM REMAINING

COMMITMENT WAS APPROXIMATELY $1.3 BILLION AS OF

DECEMBER 27, 2008. HOWEVER, THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE IMFS

FABRICATION FACILITY HAS BEEN PLACED ON HOLD.

IMFT AND IMFS ARE EACH GOVERNED BY

A BOARD OF MANAGERS, WITH MICRON AND INTEL INITIALLY APPOINTING

AN EQUAL NUMBER OF MANAGERS TO EACH OF THE BOARDS. THE NUMBER OF

MANAGERS APPOINTED BY EACH PARTY ADJUSTS DEPENDING ON THE

PARTIES OWNERSHIP INTERESTS. THESE VENTURES WILL OPERATE

UNTIL 2016 BUT ARE SUBJECT TO PRIOR TERMINATION UNDER CERTAIN

TERMS AND CONDITIONS.

THESE JOINT VENTURES ARE VARIABLE

INTEREST ENTITIES AS DEFINED BY FASB INTERPRETATION

NO. 46(R), CONSOLIDATION OF VARIABLE INTEREST

ENTITIES (FIN 46(R)), BECAUSE ALL COSTS OF THE JOINT

VENTURES WILL BE PASSED ON TO MICRON AND INTEL THROUGH OUR

PURCHASE AGREEMENTS. IMFT AND IMFS ARE DEPENDENT UPON MICRON AND

INTEL FOR ANY ADDITIONAL CASH REQUIREMENTS. OUR KNOWN MAXIMUM

EXPOSURE TO LOSS APPROXIMATED OUR INVESTMENT BALANCES AS OF

DECEMBER 27, 2008, WHICH WERE $1.7 BILLION IN IMFT AND

$329 MILLION IN IMFS ($2.2 BILLION IN IMFT AND

$146 MILLION IN IMFS AS OF DECEMBER 29, 2007). AS OF

DECEMBER 27, 2008, EXCEPT FOR THE AMOUNT DUE TO IMFT AND

IMFS FOR PRODUCT PURCHASES AND SERVICES, WE DID NOT INCUR ANY

ADDITIONAL LIABILITIES IN CONNECTION WITH OUR INTERESTS IN THESE

JOINT VENTURES. IN ADDITION TO THE POTENTIAL LOSS OF OUR

EXISTING INVESTMENTS, OUR ACTUAL LOSSES COULD BE HIGHER, AS

INTEL AND MICRON ARE LIABLE FOR OTHER FUTURE OPERATING COSTS

AND/OR

OBLIGATIONS OF IMFT AND IMFS. IN ADDITION, FUTURE CASH CALLS

COULD INCREASE OUR INVESTMENT BALANCE AND THE RELATED EXPOSURE

TO LOSS. FINALLY, AS WE ARE CURRENTLY COMMITTED TO PURCHASING

49% OF IMFTS PRODUCTION OUTPUT AND PRODUCTION-RELATED

SERVICES, WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO PURCHASE PRODUCTS AT A COST IN

EXCESS OF REALIZABLE VALUE.

MICRON AND INTEL ARE ALSO

CONSIDERED RELATED PARTIES UNDER THE PROVISIONS OF

FIN 46(R). AS A RESULT, THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY IS THE

ENTITY THAT IS MOST CLOSELY ASSOCIATED WITH THE JOINT VENTURES.

TO MAKE THAT DETERMINATION, WE REVIEWED SEVERAL FACTORS. THE

MOST IMPORTANT FACTORS WERE CONSIDERATION OF THE SIZE AND NATURE

OF THE JOINT VENTURES OPERATIONS RELATIVE TO MICRON AND

INTEL, AND WHICH PARTY HAD THE MAJORITY OF ECONOMIC EXPOSURE

UNDER THE PURCHASE AGREEMENTS. BASED ON THOSE FACTORS, WE HAVE

DETERMINED THAT MICRON IS MOST CLOSELY ASSOCIATED WITH THE JOINT

VENTURES; THEREFORE, WE ACCOUNT FOR OUR INTERESTS USING THE

EQUITY METHOD OF ACCOUNTING AND DO NOT CONSOLIDATE THESE JOINT

VENTURES.

THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR INVESTMENT

IN IMFT AND IMFS APPROXIMATED CARRYING VALUE AS OF

DECEMBER 27, 2008 AND IS INCLUDED WITHIN OTHER LONG-TERM

ASSETS. WE DETERMINE THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR INVESTMENTS IN IMFT

AND IMFS AND RELATED INTANGIBLE ASSETS USING THE INCOME

APPROACH, BASED ON A WEIGHTED AVERAGE OF MULTIPLE DISCOUNTED

CASH FLOW SCENARIOS OF OUR NAND SOLUTIONS GROUP BUSINESS. THE

ASSUMPTIONS THAT MOST SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT THE FAIR VALUE

DETERMINATION ARE THE ESTIMATES FOR THE PROJECTED REVENUE AND

DISCOUNT RATE. IT IS REASONABLY POSSIBLE THAT THE ESTIMATES USED

IN OUR VALUATION AS OF DECEMBER 27, 2008 COULD CHANGE IN

THE NEAR TERM AND RESULT IN AN IMPAIRMENT OF OUR INVESTMENTS.

BASED ON OUR VALUATION AS OF DECEMBER 27, 2008, A 5%

DECLINE IN PROJECTED REVENUE IN EACH OF OUR CASH FLOW SCENARIOS

WOULD RESULT IN A DECLINE IN THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR INVESTMENT OF

UP TO APPROXIMATELY $300 MILLION, AND A ONE PERCENTAGE

POINT INCREASE IN THE DISCOUNT RATE WOULD RESULT IN A DECLINE IN

THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR INVESTMENT BY APPROXIMATELY

$225 MILLION.

IN CONNECTION WITH AN AGREEMENT

BETWEEN INTEL AND APPLE, INC. TO SUPPLY A PORTION OF THE NAND

FLASH MEMORY OUTPUT THAT WE WILL PURCHASE FROM IMFT, APPLE

PROVIDED A REFUNDABLE $250 MILLION PRE-PAYMENT TO INTEL. IN

THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2008, THE NAND FLASH MEMORY SUPPLY

AGREEMENT WAS TERMINATED, AND THE REMAINING PORTION OF THE

PRE-PAYMENT OF $167 MILLION WAS REFUNDED TO APPLE.

FOR UNDER THE EQUITY METHOD OF ACCOUNTING, AND OUR PROPORTIONATE

SHARE OF THE INCOME OR LOSS IS RECOGNIZED ON A ONE-QUARTER LAG.

AS SUCH, WE DID NOT RECORD EQUITY METHOD ADJUSTMENTS DURING 2008

RELATED TO CLEARWIRE LLC. THE COST BASIS OF THIS INVESTMENT WAS

INITIALLY $17 PER SHARE, BASED ON THE TRANSACTION AGREEMENT

ENTERED INTO IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2008. DURING THE FOURTH

QUARTER OF 2008, WE RECORDED A $762 MILLION IMPAIRMENT

CHARGE ON OUR INVESTMENT IN CLEARWIRE LLC TO WRITE DOWN OUR

BELOW OUR SHARE OF THE BOOK VALUE OF THE NET ASSETS OF NUMONYX.

MOST OF THIS DIFFERENCE HAS BEEN ASSIGNED TO SPECIFIC NUMONYX

LONG-LIVED ASSETS, AND OUR PROPORTIONATE SHARE OF NUMONYX INCOME

DEFERRED INCOME WILL GENERALLY OFFSET THE RELATED DEPRECIATION

OVER THE LEASE TERM.



WE ENTERED INTO SUPPLY AND SERVICE

AGREEMENTS THAT INVOLVE THE MANUFACTURE AND THE ASSEMBLY AND

TEST OF NOR FLASH MEMORY PRODUCTS FOR NUMONYX THROUGH 2008. THE

FAIR VALUE OF THESE AGREEMENTS WAS $110 MILLION AND WAS

OBLIGATIONS OF NUMONYX UNDER THE SENIOR CREDIT FACILITY. A

DEMAND ON OUR GUARANTEE CAN BE TRIGGERED IF NUMONYX IS UNABLE TO

MEET ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE CREDIT FACILITY. ACCELERATION OF

THE OBLIGATIONS OF NUMONYX UNDER THE CREDIT FACILITY COULD BE

TRIGGERED BY A MONETARY DEFAULT OF NUMONYX OR, IN CERTAIN

OUR INVESTMENT. THE IMPAIRMENT CHARGES ON OUR INVESTMENT IN

MICRON REFLECT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN OUR COST BASIS AND THE

FAIR VALUE OF OUR INVESTMENT IN MICRON AT THE END OF THE SECOND

ASSESSMENT OF MICRONS FINANCIAL RESULTS AND THE

COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT, PARTICULARLY FOR NAND FLASH MEMORY

DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

OUR PRIMARY OBJECTIVE FOR HOLDING

DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS IS TO MANAGE CURRENCY EXCHANGE

RATE RISK AND INTEREST RATE RISK, AND TO A LESSER EXTENT, EQUITY

MARKET RISK AND COMMODITY PRICE RISK.

WE CURRENTLY DO NOT ENTER INTO

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS TO MANAGE CREDIT RISK; HOWEVER, WE MANAGE

OUR EXPOSURE TO CREDIT RISK THROUGH OUR POLICIES. WE GENERALLY

ENTER INTO DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS WITH HIGH-CREDIT-QUALITY

OUR ANALYSIS OF THAT COUNTERPARTYS RELATIVE CREDIT

STANDING. SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR INVESTMENTS IN DEBT

INSTRUMENTS ARE WITH A/A2 OR BETTER RATED ISSUERS, AND THE

MAJORITY OF THE ISSUERS ARE RATED AA-/AA2 OR BETTER. OUR

INVESTMENT POLICY REQUIRES ALL INVESTMENTS WITH ORIGINAL

MATURITIES OF UP TO SIX MONTHS TO BE RATED AT LEAST

STANDARD & POORS/MOODYS, AND SPECIFIES A

HIGHER MINIMUM RATING FOR INVESTMENTS WITH LONGER MATURITIES.

ASSETS. WE DETERMINED THE FAIR VALUE USING A MARKET-BASED

VALUATION TECHNIQUE. IN ADDITION, AS A RESULT OF BOTH THIS

DIVESTITURE AND A SUBSEQUENT ASSESSMENT OF OUR WORLDWIDE

MANUFACTURING CAPACITY OPERATIONS, WE PLACED FOR SALE OUR

FABRICATION FACILITY IN COLORADO SPRINGS, COLORADO. THIS PLAN

RESULTED IN AN IMPAIRMENT CHARGE OF $214 MILLION TO WRITE

DOWN TO FAIR VALUE THE LAND, BUILDING, AND EQUIPMENT ASSET

GROUPING THAT HAS BEEN PRINCIPALLY USED TO SUPPORT OUR

COMMUNICATIONS AND APPLICATION PROCESSOR BUSINESS. WE DETERMINED

THE FAIR MARKET VALUE OF THE ASSET GROUPING USING AN AVERAGE OF

THE RESULTS FROM USING THE COST APPROACH AND MARKET APPROACH

VALUATION TECHNIQUES.

DURING 2007, WE INCURRED AN

ADDITIONAL $54 MILLION IN ASSET IMPAIRMENT CHARGES AS A

RESULT OF MARKET CONDITIONS RELATED TO THE COLORADO SPRINGS

FACILITY. ALSO, WE RECORDED LAND AND BUILDING WRITE-DOWNS

RELATED TO CERTAIN FACILITIES IN SANTA CLARA, CALIFORNIA.

IN ADDITION, WE INCURRED $85 MILLION IN ASSET IMPAIRMENT

CHARGES RELATED TO ASSETS THAT WE SOLD IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE

DIVESTITURE OF OUR NOR FLASH MEMORY BUSINESS. WE DETERMINED THE

IMPAIRMENT CHARGES BASED ON THE FAIR VALUE, LESS SELLING COSTS,

THAT WE EXPECTED TO RECEIVE UPON COMPLETION OF THE DIVESTITURE.

DURING 2008, WE INCURRED

ADDITIONAL ASSET IMPAIRMENT CHARGES RELATED TO THE COLORADO

SPRINGS FACILITY, BASED ON MARKET CONDITIONS. ALSO, WE INCURRED

$275 MILLION IN ADDITIONAL ASSET IMPAIRMENT CHARGES RELATED

TO ASSETS THAT WE SOLD IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE DIVESTITURE OF

OUR NOR FLASH MEMORY BUSINESS. WE DETERMINED THE IMPAIRMENT

CHARGES USING THE REVISED FAIR VALUE OF THE EQUITY AND NOTE

RECEIVABLE THAT WE RECEIVED UPON COMPLETION OF THE DIVESTITURE,

LESS SELLING COSTS. THE LOWER FAIR VALUE WAS PRIMARILY A RESULT

OF A DECLINE IN THE OUTLOOK FOR THE FLASH MEMORY MARKET SEGMENT.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(CONTINUED)

IN 2005, WE ISSUED

$1.6 BILLION OF 2.95% JUNIOR SUBORDINATED CONVERTIBLE

DEBENTURES (THE DEBENTURES) DUE 2035. THE DEBENTURES ARE

CONVERTIBLE, SUBJECT TO CERTAIN CONDITIONS, INTO SHARES OF OUR

COMMON STOCK AT AN INITIAL CONVERSION RATE OF

31.7162 SHARES OF COMMON STOCK PER $1,000 PRINCIPAL AMOUNT

OF DEBENTURES, REPRESENTING AN INITIAL EFFECTIVE CONVERSION

PRICE OF APPROXIMATELY $31.53 PER SHARE OF COMMON STOCK. HOLDERS

CAN SURRENDER THE DEBENTURES FOR CONVERSION AT ANY TIME. THE

CONVERSION RATE WILL BE SUBJECT TO ADJUSTMENT FOR CERTAIN EVENTS

OUTLINED IN THE INDENTURE GOVERNING THE DEBENTURES (THE

INDENTURE), BUT WILL NOT BE ADJUSTED FOR ACCRUED INTEREST. IN

ADDITION, THE CONVERSION RATE WILL INCREASE FOR A HOLDER WHO

ELECTS TO CONVERT THE DEBENTURES IN CONNECTION WITH CERTAIN

SHARE EXCHANGES, MERGERS, OR CONSOLIDATIONS INVOLVING INTEL, AS

DESCRIBED IN THE INDENTURE. THE DEBENTURES, WHICH PAY A FIXED

RATE OF INTEREST SEMIANNUALLY, HAVE A CONTINGENT INTEREST

COMPONENT THAT WILL REQUIRE US TO PAY INTEREST BASED ON CERTAIN

THRESHOLDS AND FOR CERTAIN EVENTS COMMENCING ON

DECEMBER 15, 2010, AS OUTLINED IN THE INDENTURE. THE

MAXIMUM AMOUNT OF CONTINGENT INTEREST THAT WILL ACCRUE IS 0.40%

PER YEAR. THE FAIR VALUE OF THE RELATED EMBEDDED DERIVATIVE WAS

NOT SIGNIFICANT AS OF DECEMBER 27, 2008 OR

DECEMBER 29, 2007.

WE CAN SETTLE ANY CONVERSION OR

REPURCHASE OF THE DEBENTURES IN CASH OR STOCK AT OUR OPTION. ON

OR AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2012, WE CAN REDEEM, FOR CASH, ALL OR

PART OF THE DEBENTURES FOR THE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT, PLUS ANY

ACCRUED AND UNPAID INTEREST, IF THE CLOSING PRICE OF INTEL

COMMON STOCK HAS BEEN AT LEAST 130% OF THE CONVERSION PRICE THEN

IN EFFECT FOR AT LEAST 20 TRADING DAYS DURING ANY 30 CONSECUTIVE

TRADING-DAY

PERIOD PRIOR TO THE DATE ON WHICH WE PROVIDE NOTICE OF

REDEMPTION. IF CERTAIN EVENTS OCCUR IN THE FUTURE, THE INDENTURE

PROVIDES THAT EACH HOLDER OF THE DEBENTURES CAN, FOR A

PRE-DEFINED PERIOD OF TIME, REQUIRE US TO REPURCHASE THE

HOLDERS DEBENTURES FOR THE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT PLUS ANY

ACCRUED AND UNPAID INTEREST. THE DEBENTURES ARE SUBORDINATED IN

RIGHT OF PAYMENT TO OUR EXISTING AND FUTURE SENIOR DEBT AND TO

THE OTHER LIABILITIES OF OUR SUBSIDIARIES. WE CONCLUDED THAT THE

DEBENTURES ARE NOT CONVENTIONAL CONVERTIBLE DEBT INSTRUMENTS AND

THAT THE EMBEDDED STOCK CONVERSION OPTION QUALIFIES AS A

DERIVATIVE UNDER SFAS NO. 133. IN ADDITION, IN

ACCORDANCE WITH

EITF 00-19,

ACCOUNTING FOR DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS INDEXED

TO, AND POTENTIALLY SETTLED IN, A COMPANYS OWN

STOCK, WE HAVE CONCLUDED THAT THE EMBEDDED CONVERSION

OPTION WOULD BE CLASSIFIED IN STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY IF IT

WERE A FREESTANDING INSTRUMENT. AS SUCH, THE EMBEDDED CONVERSION

OPTION IS NOT ACCOUNTED FOR SEPARATELY AS A DERIVATIVE.

IN 2005, WE GUARANTEED REPAYMENT

OF PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST ON BONDS ISSUED BY THE INDUSTRIAL

DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY OF THE CITY OF CHANDLER, ARIZONA, WHICH

CONSTITUTES AN UNSECURED GENERAL OBLIGATION FOR INTEL. THE

AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT, INCLUDING THE PREMIUM, OF THE BONDS

ISSUED IN 2005 (2005 ARIZONA BONDS) WAS $160 MILLION. THE

BONDS ARE DUE IN 2035 AND BEAR INTEREST AT A FIXED RATE OF

4.375% UNTIL 2010. THE 2005 ARIZONA BONDS ARE SUBJECT TO

MANDATORY TENDER ON NOVEMBER 30, 2010, AT WHICH TIME WE CAN

RE-MARKET THE BONDS AS EITHER FIXED-RATE BONDS FOR A SPECIFIED

PERIOD OR AS VARIABLE-RATE BONDS UNTIL THEIR FINAL MATURITY ON

DECEMBER 1, 2035.

IN 2007, WE GUARANTEED REPAYMENT

OF PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST ON BONDS ISSUED BY THE INDUSTRIAL

DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY OF THE CITY OF CHANDLER, ARIZONA, WHICH

CONSTITUTE AN UNSECURED GENERAL OBLIGATION FOR INTEL. THE

AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF THE BONDS ISSUED IN DECEMBER 2007

(2007 ARIZONA BONDS) IS $125 MILLION DUE IN 2037, AND THE

BONDS BEAR INTEREST AT A FIXED RATE OF 5.3%. THE 2007 ARIZONA

BONDS ARE SUBJECT TO MANDATORY TENDER, AT OUR OPTION, ON ANY

INTEREST PAYMENT DATE BEGINNING ON OR AFTER DECEMBER 1,

2012 UNTIL THEIR FINAL MATURITY ON DECEMBER 1, 2037. UPON

SUCH TENDER, WE CAN RE-MARKET THE BONDS AS EITHER FIXED-RATE

BONDS FOR A SPECIFIED PERIOD OR AS VARIABLE-RATE BONDS UNTIL

THEIR FINAL MATURITY. WE ALSO ENTERED INTO AN INTEREST RATE SWAP

AGREEMENT, FROM A FIXED RATE TO A FLOATING LIBOR-BASED RETURN.

AT THE BEGINNING OF THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2008, WE ELECTED THE

PROVISIONS OF SFAS NO. 159 FOR THE 2007 ARIZONA BONDS,

AND WE RECORD THESE BONDS AT FAIR VALUE. FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION,

SEE NOTE 3: FAIR VALUE.

WE HAVE EURO BORROWINGS THAT WE

MADE IN CONNECTION WITH FINANCING MANUFACTURING FACILITIES AND

EQUIPMENT IN IRELAND. WE INVESTED THE PROCEEDS IN

EURO-DENOMINATED LOAN PARTICIPATION NOTES OF SIMILAR MATURITY TO

REDUCE CURRENCY AND INTEREST RATE EXPOSURES. DURING 2008, WE

RETIRED $96 MILLION IN EURO BORROWINGS PRIOR TO THEIR

MATURITY DATES THROUGH THE SIMULTANEOUS SETTLEMENT OF AN

EQUIVALENT AMOUNT OF INVESTMENTS IN LOAN PARTICIPATION NOTES.

RETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS

PROFIT

SHARING PLANS

WE PROVIDE TAX-QUALIFIED PROFIT

SHARING RETIREMENT PLANS FOR THE BENEFIT OF ELIGIBLE EMPLOYEES,

FORMER EMPLOYEES, AND RETIREES IN THE U.S. AND CERTAIN

OTHER COUNTRIES. THE PLANS ARE DESIGNED TO PROVIDE EMPLOYEES

WITH AN ACCUMULATION OF FUNDS FOR RETIREMENT ON A TAX-DEFERRED

BASIS AND PROVIDE FOR ANNUAL DISCRETIONARY EMPLOYER

CONTRIBUTIONS. OUR CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER (CEO) DETERMINES THE

AMOUNTS TO BE CONTRIBUTED TO THE U.S. PROFIT SHARING PLAN

UNDER DELEGATION OF AUTHORITY FROM OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS,

PURSUANT TO THE TERMS OF THE PROFIT SHARING PLAN. AS OF

DECEMBER 27, 2008, APPROXIMATELY 75% OF OUR

U.S. PROFIT SHARING FUND WAS INVESTED IN EQUITIES, AND

APPROXIMATELY 25% WAS INVESTED IN FIXED-INCOME INSTRUMENTS. MOST

ASSETS ARE MANAGED BY EXTERNAL INVESTMENT MANAGERS.

FOR THE BENEFIT OF ELIGIBLE

U.S. EMPLOYEES, WE ALSO PROVIDE A NON-TAX-QUALIFIED

SUPPLEMENTAL DEFERRED COMPENSATION PLAN FOR CERTAIN HIGHLY

COMPENSATED EMPLOYEES. THIS PLAN IS DESIGNED TO PERMIT CERTAIN

DISCRETIONARY EMPLOYER CONTRIBUTIONS AND TO PERMIT EMPLOYEE

DEFERRAL OF A PORTION OF SALARIES IN EXCESS OF CERTAIN TAX

LIMITS AND DEFERRAL OF BONUSES. THIS PLAN IS UNFUNDED.

WE EXPENSED $289 MILLION FOR

THE QUALIFIED AND NON-QUALIFIED U.S. PROFIT SHARING

RETIREMENT PLANS IN 2008 ($302 MILLION IN 2007 AND

$313 MILLION IN 2006). IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2009, WE

FUNDED $276 MILLION FOR THE 2008 CONTRIBUTION TO THE

QUALIFIED U.S. PROFIT SHARING PLAN.

CONTRIBUTIONS THAT WE MAKE TO THE

U.S. PROFIT SHARING PLAN ON BEHALF OF OUR EMPLOYEES VEST

BASED ON THE EMPLOYEES YEARS OF SERVICE. VESTING OCCURS

AFTER TWO YEARS OF SERVICE IN 20% ANNUAL INCREMENTS UNTIL THE

EMPLOYEE IS 100% VESTED AFTER SIX YEARS, OR EARLIER IF THE

EMPLOYEE REACHES AGE 60.

PENSION

AND POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS

U.S. PENSION

BENEFITS.

WE

PROVIDE A TAX-QUALIFIED DEFINED-BENEFIT PENSION PLAN FOR THE

BENEFIT OF ELIGIBLE EMPLOYEES AND RETIREES IN THE U.S. THE

PLAN PROVIDES FOR A MINIMUM PENSION BENEFIT THAT IS DETERMINED

BY A PARTICIPANTS YEARS OF SERVICE AND FINAL AVERAGE

COMPENSATION (TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE PARTICIPANTS SOCIAL

SECURITY WAGE BASE), REDUCED BY THE PARTICIPANTS BALANCE

IN THE U.S. PROFIT SHARING PLAN. IF THE PENSION BENEFIT

EXCEEDS THE PARTICIPANTS BALANCE IN THE U.S. PROFIT

SHARING PLAN, THE PARTICIPANT WILL RECEIVE A COMBINATION OF

PENSION AND PROFIT SHARING AMOUNTS EQUAL TO THE PENSION BENEFIT.

HOWEVER, THE PARTICIPANT WILL RECEIVE ONLY THE BENEFIT FROM THE

PROFIT SHARING PLAN IF THAT BENEFIT IS GREATER THAN THE VALUE OF

THE PENSION BENEFIT. IF WE DO NOT CONTINUE TO CONTRIBUTE TO, OR

SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE CONTRIBUTIONS TO, THE U.S. PROFIT

SHARING PLAN, THE PROJECTED BENEFIT OBLIGATION OF THE

U.S. DEFINED-BENEFIT PLAN COULD INCREASE SIGNIFICANTLY. THE

SIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE U.S. PROFIT

SHARING PLAN ASSETS DURING 2008 CONTRIBUTED TO AN INCREASE IN

THE PROJECTED BENEFIT OBLIGATION OF THE

U.S. DEFINED-BENEFIT PLAN.

NON-U.S. PENSION

BENEFITS.

WE ALSO

PROVIDE DEFINED-BENEFIT PENSION PLANS IN CERTAIN OTHER

COUNTRIES. CONSISTENT WITH THE REQUIREMENTS OF LOCAL LAW, WE

DEPOSIT FUNDS FOR CERTAIN PLANS WITH INSURANCE COMPANIES, WITH

THIRD-PARTY TRUSTEES, OR INTO GOVERNMENT-MANAGED ACCOUNTS,

AND/OR

ACCRUE FOR THE UNFUNDED PORTION OF THE OBLIGATION. THE

ASSUMPTIONS USED IN CALCULATING THE OBLIGATION FOR THE

NON-U.S. PLANS

DEPEND ON THE LOCAL ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT.

POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL

BENEFITS.

UPON

RETIREMENT, ELIGIBLE U.S. EMPLOYEES ARE CREDITED WITH A

DEFINED DOLLAR AMOUNT BASED ON YEARS OF SERVICE. THESE CREDITS

CAN BE USED TO PAY ALL OR A PORTION OF THE COST TO PURCHASE

COVERAGE IN AN INTEL-SPONSORED MEDICAL PLAN. IF THE AVAILABLE

CREDITS ARE NOT SUFFICIENT TO PAY THE ENTIRE COST OF THE

COVERAGE, THE REMAINING COST IS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE

RETIREE.

FUNDING

POLICY.

OUR

PRACTICE IS TO FUND THE VARIOUS PENSION PLANS IN AMOUNTS

SUFFICIENT TO MEET THE MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS OF U.S. FEDERAL

LAWS AND REGULATIONS OR APPLICABLE LOCAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS.

ADDITIONAL FUNDING MAY BE PROVIDED AS DEEMED APPROPRIATE. THE

ASSETS OF THE VARIOUS PLANS ARE INVESTED IN CORPORATE EQUITIES,

CORPORATE DEBT INSTRUMENTS, GOVERNMENT SECURITIES, AND OTHER

INSTITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENTS. THE PORTFOLIO OF EACH PLAN DEPENDS

ON PLAN DESIGN AND APPLICABLE LOCAL LAWS. DEPENDING ON THE

FOR THE U.S. PLANS, WE

DEVELOPED THE DISCOUNT RATE BY CALCULATING THE BENEFIT PAYMENT

STREAMS BY YEAR TO DETERMINE WHEN BENEFIT PAYMENTS WILL BE DUE.

WE THEN MATCHED THE BENEFIT PAYMENT STREAMS BY YEAR TO THE AA

CORPORATE BOND RATES TO MATCH THE TIMING AND AMOUNT OF THE

EXPECTED BENEFIT PAYMENTS AND DISCOUNTED BACK TO THE MEASUREMENT

DATE TO DETERMINE THE APPROPRIATE DISCOUNT RATE. FOR THE

NON-U.S. PLANS,

WE USED TWO APPROACHES TO DEVELOP THE DISCOUNT RATE. IN CERTAIN

COUNTRIES, WE USED A MODEL CONSISTING OF A THEORETICAL BOND

PORTFOLIO FOR WHICH THE TIMING AND AMOUNT OF CASH FLOWS

APPROXIMATES THE ESTIMATED BENEFIT PAYMENTS OF OUR PENSION

PLANS. IN OTHER COUNTRIES, WE ANALYZED CURRENT MARKET LONG-TERM

BOND RATES AND MATCHED THE BOND MATURITY WITH THE AVERAGE

DURATION OF THE PENSION LIABILITIES. WE CONSIDER SEVERAL FACTORS

IN DEVELOPING THE ASSET RETURN ASSUMPTIONS FOR THE U.S. AND

NON-U.S. PLANS.

WE ANALYZED RATES OF RETURN RELEVANT TO THE COUNTRY WHERE EACH

PLAN IS IN EFFECT AND THE INVESTMENTS APPLICABLE TO THE PLAN,

EXPECTATIONS OF FUTURE RETURNS, LOCAL ACTUARIAL PROJECTIONS, AND

THE PROJECTED LONG-TERM RATES OF RETURN FROM INVESTMENT

MANAGERS. THE EXPECTED LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN SHOWN FOR THE

NON-U.S. PLAN

ASSETS IS WEIGHTED TO REFLECT EACH COUNTRYS RELATIVE

PORTION OF THE

NON-U.S. PLAN

ASSETS.

U.S.

PLAN ASSETS

IN GENERAL, THE INVESTMENT

STRATEGY FOR U.S. PLAN ASSETS IS TO ASSURE THAT THE PENSION

ASSETS ARE AVAILABLE TO PAY BENEFITS AS THEY COME DUE AND TO

MINIMIZE MARKET RISK. WHEN DEEMED APPROPRIATE, WE MAY INVEST A

PORTION OF THE FUND IN FUTURES CONTRACTS FOR THE PURPOSE OF

ACTING AS A TEMPORARY SUBSTITUTE FOR AN INVESTMENT IN A

PARTICULAR EQUITY SECURITY. THE FUND DOES NOT ENGAGE IN

SPECULATIVE FUTURES TRANSACTIONS. THE U.S. PLAN ASSETS ARE

MANAGED TO REMAIN WITHIN THE TARGET ALLOCATION RANGES LISTED

BELOW. AS OF DECEMBER 27, 2008, OUR PLAN ASSETS WERE NOT

WITHIN OUR TARGET ALLOCATION DUE TO MARKET VOLATILITY. AT TIMES

OUR ALLOCATION WILL TEMPORARILY FALL OUTSIDE THE TARGET

ALLOCATION RANGE, AS WE RE-ALLOCATE PLAN ASSETS DUE TO MARKET

CONDITIONS, SUCH AS VOLATILITY AND LIQUIDITY CONCERNS, TO

MINIMIZE MARKET RISK. THE EXPECTED LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN FOR

THE U.S. PLAN ASSETS IS 4.5%.

THE ASSET ALLOCATION FOR OUR

U.S. PENSION PLAN AT THE END OF FISCAL YEARS 2008 AND 2007,

AND THE TARGET ALLOCATION RATE FOR 2009, BY ASSET CATEGORY, ARE

THE INVESTMENTS OF THE

ARE MANAGED BY INSURANCE COMPANIES, THIRD-PARTY TRUSTEES, OR

PENSION FUNDS, CONSISTENT WITH REGULATIONS OR MARKET PRACTICE OF

THE COUNTRY WHERE THE ASSETS ARE INVESTED. THE INVESTMENT

MANAGER MAKES INVESTMENT DECISIONS WITHIN THE GUIDELINES SET BY

US OR LOCAL REGULATIONS. THE INVESTMENT MANAGER EVALUATES

PERFORMANCE BY COMPARING THE ACTUAL RATE OF RETURN TO THE RETURN

ON OTHER SIMILAR ASSETS. INVESTMENTS MANAGED BY QUALIFIED

INSURANCE COMPANIES OR PENSION FUNDS UNDER STANDARD CONTRACTS

FOLLOW LOCAL REGULATIONS, AND WE ARE NOT ACTIVELY INVOLVED IN

THEIR INVESTMENT STRATEGIES. IN GENERAL, THE INVESTMENT STRATEGY

IS DESIGNED TO ACCUMULATE A DIVERSIFIED PORTFOLIO AMONG MARKETS,

ASSET CLASSES, OR INDIVIDUAL SECURITIES IN ORDER TO REDUCE

MARKET RISK AND ASSURE THAT THE PENSION ASSETS ARE AVAILABLE TO

PAY BENEFITS AS THEY COME DUE. THE AVERAGE EXPECTED LONG-TERM

RATE OF RETURN FOR THE

NOTE 19.

EMPLOYEE EQUITY INCENTIVE PLANS

OUR EQUITY INCENTIVE PLANS ARE

BROAD-BASED, LONG-TERM RETENTION PROGRAMS INTENDED TO ATTRACT

AND RETAIN TALENTED EMPLOYEES AND ALIGN STOCKHOLDER AND EMPLOYEE

INTERESTS.

IN MAY 2007, STOCKHOLDERS APPROVED

AN EXTENSION OF THE 2006 EQUITY INCENTIVE PLAN (THE 2006 PLAN).

STOCKHOLDERS APPROVED 119 MILLION ADDITIONAL SHARES FOR

ISSUANCE, INCREASING THE TOTAL SHARES OF COMMON STOCK AVAILABLE

FOR ISSUANCE AS EQUITY AWARDS TO EMPLOYEES AND NON-EMPLOYEE

DIRECTORS TO 294 MILLION SHARES. OF THIS AMOUNT, WE

INCREASED THE MAXIMUM NUMBER OF SHARES TO BE AWARDED AS

NON-VESTED SHARES (RESTRICTED STOCK) OR NON-VESTED SHARE UNITS

(RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS) TO 168 MILLION SHARES. THE

APPROVAL ALSO EXTENDED THE EXPIRATION DATE OF THE 2006 PLAN TO

JUNE 2010. THE 2006 PLAN ALLOWS FOR TIME-BASED,

PERFORMANCE-BASED, AND MARKET-BASED VESTING FOR EQUITY INCENTIVE

AWARDS. AS OF DECEMBER 27, 2008, WE HAD NOT ISSUED ANY

PERFORMANCE-BASED OR MARKET-BASED EQUITY INCENTIVE AWARDS. AS OF

DECEMBER 27, 2008, 174 MILLION SHARES REMAINED

AVAILABLE FOR FUTURE GRANT UNDER THE 2006 PLAN. WE MAY ASSUME

THE EQUITY INCENTIVE PLANS AND THE OUTSTANDING EQUITY AWARDS OF

CERTAIN ACQUIRED COMPANIES. ONCE THEY ARE ASSUMED, WE DO NOT

GRANT ADDITIONAL SHARES UNDER THESE PLANS.

WE BEGAN ISSUING RESTRICTED STOCK

UNITS IN 2006. WE ISSUE SHARES ON THE DATE THAT THE RESTRICTED

STOCK UNITS VEST. THE MAJORITY OF SHARES ISSUED ARE NET OF THE

STATUTORY WITHHOLDING REQUIREMENTS THAT WE PAY ON BEHALF OF OUR

EMPLOYEES. AS A RESULT, THE ACTUAL NUMBER OF SHARES ISSUED WILL

BE LESS THAN THE NUMBER OF RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS GRANTED. PRIOR

TO VESTING, RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS DO NOT HAVE DIVIDEND

EQUIVALENT RIGHTS, DO NOT HAVE VOTING RIGHTS, AND THE SHARES

UNDERLYING THE RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS ARE NOT CONSIDERED ISSUED

AND OUTSTANDING.

EQUITY AWARDS GRANTED TO EMPLOYEES

IN 2008 UNDER OUR EQUITY INCENTIVE PLANS GENERALLY VEST OVER

4 YEARS FROM THE DATE OF GRANT, AND OPTIONS EXPIRE

7 YEARS FROM THE DATE OF GRANT. EQUITY AWARDS GRANTED TO

KEY OFFICERS, SENIOR-LEVEL EMPLOYEES, AND KEY EMPLOYEES IN

2008 MAY HAVE DELAYED VESTING BEGINNING 2 TO 5 YEARS

FROM THE DATE OF GRANT, AND OPTIONS EXPIRE 7 TO 10 YEARS

FROM THE DATE OF GRANT.

THE 2006 STOCK PURCHASE PLAN

ALLOWS ELIGIBLE EMPLOYEES TO PURCHASE SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK

AT 85% OF THE VALUE OF OUR COMMON STOCK ON SPECIFIC DATES. UNDER

THE 2006 STOCK PURCHASE PLAN, WE MADE 240 MILLION SHARES OF

COMMON STOCK AVAILABLE FOR ISSUANCE THROUGH AUGUST 2011. AS OF

DECEMBER 27, 2008, 188 MILLION SHARES WERE AVAILABLE

FOR ISSUANCE UNDER THE 2006 STOCK PURCHASE PLAN.

SHARE-BASED

COMPENSATION

EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2006, WE

ADOPTED THE PROVISIONS OF SFAS NO. 123(R), AS

DISCUSSED IN NOTE 2: ACCOUNTING POLICIES.

SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION RECOGNIZED IN 2008 WAS

$851 MILLION ($952 MILLION IN 2007 AND

$1,375 MILLION IN 2006).

IN ACCORDANCE WITH

SFAS NO. 123(R), WE ADJUST SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION ON

A QUARTERLY BASIS FOR CHANGES TO OUR ESTIMATE OF EXPECTED EQUITY

AWARD FORFEITURES BASED ON OUR REVIEW OF RECENT FORFEITURE

ACTIVITY AND EXPECTED FUTURE EMPLOYEE TURNOVER. WE RECOGNIZE THE

EFFECT OF ADJUSTING THE FORFEITURE RATE FOR ALL EXPENSE

AMORTIZATION AFTER JANUARY 1, 2006 IN THE PERIOD THAT WE

CHANGE THE FORFEITURE ESTIMATE. THE EFFECT OF FORFEITURE

ADJUSTMENTS IN 2006, 2007, AND 2008 WAS NOT SIGNIFICANT.

THE TOTAL SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION

COST CAPITALIZED AS PART OF INVENTORY AS OF DECEMBER 27,

2008 WAS $46 MILLION ($41 MILLION AS OF

DECEMBER 29, 2007 AND $72 MILLION AS OF

DECEMBER 30, 2006). DURING 2008, THE TAX BENEFIT THAT WE

REALIZED FOR THE TAX DEDUCTION FROM OPTION EXERCISES AND OTHER

AWARDS TOTALED $147 MILLION ($265 MILLION IN 2007 AND

$139 MILLION IN 2006).

WE ESTIMATE THE FAIR VALUE OF

RESTRICTED STOCK UNIT AWARDS USING THE VALUE OF OUR COMMON STOCK

ON THE DATE OF GRANT, REDUCED BY THE PRESENT VALUE OF DIVIDENDS

EXPECTED TO BE PAID ON OUR COMMON STOCK PRIOR TO VESTING. WE

BASED THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE ESTIMATED VALUES OF RESTRICTED STOCK

STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM

WE HAVE AN ONGOING AUTHORIZATION,

AMENDED IN NOVEMBER 2005, FROM OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS TO

REPURCHASE UP TO $25 BILLION IN SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK

IN OPEN MARKET OR NEGOTIATED TRANSACTIONS. DURING 2008, WE

REPURCHASED 324 MILLION SHARES OF COMMON STOCK AT A COST OF

$7.1 BILLION (111 MILLION SHARES AT A COST OF

$2.75 BILLION DURING 2007 AND 226 MILLION SHARES AT A

COST OF $4.6 BILLION DURING 2006). WE HAVE REPURCHASED AND

RETIRED 3.3 BILLION SHARES AT A COST OF APPROXIMATELY

$67 BILLION SINCE THE PROGRAM BEGAN IN 1990. AS OF

DECEMBER 27, 2008, $7.4 BILLION REMAINED AVAILABLE FOR

REPURCHASE UNDER THE EXISTING REPURCHASE AUTHORIZATION. A

PORTION OF OUR PURCHASES IN 2008 AND 2007 WAS EXECUTED UNDER

PRIVATELY NEGOTIATED FORWARD PURCHASE AGREEMENTS.

RESTRICTED

STOCK UNIT WITHHOLDINGS

WE ISSUE RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS AS

PART OF OUR EQUITY INCENTIVE PLANS. FOR THE MAJORITY OF

RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS GRANTED, THE NUMBER OF SHARES ISSUED ON

THE DATE THE RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS VEST IS NET OF THE STATUTORY

WITHHOLDING REQUIREMENTS THAT WE PAY ON BEHALF OF OUR EMPLOYEES.

DURING 2008, WE WITHHELD 3.5 MILLION SHARES

(1.7 MILLION SHARES DURING 2007) TO SATISFY

$78 MILLION ($38 MILLION DURING 2007) OF

EMPLOYEES TAX OBLIGATIONS. ALTHOUGH SHARES WITHHELD ARE

NOT ISSUED, THEY ARE TREATED AS COMMON STOCK REPURCHASES FOR

ACCOUNTING AND DISCLOSURE PURPOSES, AS THEY REDUCE THE NUMBER OF

SHARES THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN ISSUED UPON VESTING.

POTENTIALLY DILUTIVE COMMON SHARES ARE DETERMINED BY APPLYING

THE TREASURY STOCK METHOD TO THE ASSUMED EXERCISE OF OUTSTANDING

SHARE BECAUSE THE EXERCISE PRICES OF THESE STOCK OPTIONS WERE

HEDGING INSTRUMENTS GAINS OR LOSSES EXCLUDED FROM THE

HEDGES. ADDITIONALLY, FOR ALL PERIODS PRESENTED, THERE WAS NOT A

SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FROM DISCONTINUED

WE HAD STATE TAX CREDITS OF

$158 MILLION AS OF DECEMBER 27, 2008 THAT WILL EXPIRE

BETWEEN 2009 AND 2019. THE NET DEFERRED TAX ASSET VALUATION

ALLOWANCE WAS $358 MILLION AS OF DECEMBER 27, 2008

COMPARED TO $133 MILLION AS OF DECEMBER 29, 2007. THE

VALUATION ALLOWANCE IS BASED ON OUR ASSESSMENT THAT IT IS MORE

LIKELY THAN NOT THAT CERTAIN DEFERRED TAX ASSETS WILL NOT BE

REALIZED IN THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. $258 MILLION OF THE

VALUATION ALLOWANCE AS OF DECEMBER 27, 2008 WAS RELATED TO

INVESTMENT ASSET IMPAIRMENTS, AND THE REMAINING

$100 MILLION OF THE VALUATION ALLOWANCE WAS RELATED TO

UNREALIZED STATE CREDIT CARRY FORWARDS.

AS OF DECEMBER 27, 2008,

U.S. DEFERRED INCOME TAXES HAVE NOT BEEN PROVIDED FOR ON A

CUMULATIVE TOTAL OF APPROXIMATELY $7.5 BILLION OF

UNDISTRIBUTED EARNINGS FOR CERTAIN

NON-U.S. SUBSIDIARIES.

DETERMINATION OF THE AMOUNT OF UNRECOGNIZED DEFERRED TAX

LIABILITY FOR TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES RELATED TO INVESTMENTS IN

THESE

NON-U.S. SUBSIDIARIES

THAT ARE ESSENTIALLY PERMANENT IN DURATION IS NOT PRACTICABLE.

WE CURRENTLY INTEND TO REINVEST THOSE EARNINGS IN OPERATIONS

OUTSIDE THE U.S.

EFFECTIVE AT THE BEGINNING OF THE

FIRST QUARTER OF 2007, WE ADOPTED THE PROVISIONS OF FIN 48.

AS A RESULT OF THE IMPLEMENTATION OF FIN 48, WE REDUCED THE

LIABILITY FOR NET UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS BY

$181 MILLION, AND ACCOUNTED FOR THE REDUCTION AS A

CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF A CHANGE IN ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLE THAT

RESULTED IN AN INCREASE TO RETAINED EARNINGS OF

$181 MILLION.

DURING 2007, THE

U.S. INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE (IRS) CLOSED ITS EXAMINATION

OF OUR TAX RETURNS FOR THE YEARS 1999 THROUGH 2002, RESOLVING

ISSUES RELATED TO THE TAX BENEFITS FOR EXPORT SALES AS WELL AS A

NUMBER OF OTHER ISSUES. ADDITIONALLY, WE REACHED A SETTLEMENT

WITH THE IRS FOR YEARS 2003 THROUGH 2005 WITH RESPECT TO THE TAX

BENEFITS FOR EXPORT SALES. IN CONNECTION WITH THE

$739 MILLION SETTLEMENT WITH THE IRS, WE REVERSED LONG-TERM

INCOME TAXES PAYABLE, WHICH RESULTED IN A $276 MILLION TAX

BENEFIT IN 2007.

ALSO DURING 2007, WE EFFECTIVELY

SETTLED WITH THE IRS ON SEVERAL OTHER MATTERS RELATED TO THE

AUDIT FOR THE 2003 AND 2004 TAX YEARS, DESPITE THE FACT THAT THE

IRS AUDIT FOR THOSE YEARS REMAINS OPEN. THE RESULT OF

EFFECTIVELY SETTLING THOSE POSITIONS AND THE PROCESS OF

RE-EVALUATING, BASED ON ALL AVAILABLE INFORMATION AND CERTAIN

REQUIRED REMEASUREMENTS, WAS A REDUCTION OF $389 MILLION IN

THE BALANCE OF OUR GROSS UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS,

$155 MILLION OF WHICH RESULTED IN A TAX BENEFIT IN 2007.

IF THE REMAINING BALANCE OF

$744 MILLION OF UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS AS OF

DECEMBER 27, 2008 ($794 MILLION AS OF

DECEMBER 29, 2007) WERE REALIZED IN A FUTURE PERIOD,

IT WOULD RESULT IN A TAX BENEFIT OF $590 MILLION AND A

REDUCTION OF THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE ($661 MILLION AS OF

DECEMBER 29, 2007).

DURING ALL YEARS PRESENTED, WE

RECOGNIZED INTEREST AND PENALTIES RELATED TO UNRECOGNIZED TAX

BENEFITS WITHIN THE PROVISION FOR TAXES ON THE CONSOLIDATED

STATEMENTS OF INCOME. THEREFORE, NO CHANGE WAS NECESSARY UPON

ADOPTION OF FIN 48. IN 2008, WE RECOGNIZED $6 MILLION

IN INTEREST AND PENALTIES. IN 2007, WE RECOGNIZED A NET BENEFIT

OF $142 MILLION, PRIMARILY DUE TO THE REVERSAL OF ACCRUED

INTEREST AND PENALTIES RELATED TO THE SETTLEMENT ACTIVITY

DESCRIBED ABOVE. AS OF DECEMBER 27, 2008, WE HAD

$153 MILLION OF ACCRUED INTEREST AND PENALTIES RELATED TO

UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS ($115 MILLION AS OF

DECEMBER 29, 2007).

DURING 2008, WE REACHED A

SETTLEMENT WITH THE IRS AND SEVERAL STATE TAX AUTHORITIES

RELATED TO PRIOR YEARS RESULTING IN PAYMENTS OF $51 MILLION AND

A DECREASE IN BALANCES RELATED TO TAX POSITIONS TAKEN DURING

PRIOR PERIODS OF $103 MILLION.

ALTHOUGH THE TIMING OF THE

RESOLUTION

AND/OR

CLOSURE ON AUDITS IS HIGHLY UNCERTAIN, IT IS REASONABLY POSSIBLE

THAT THE BALANCE OF GROSS UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS COULD

SIGNIFICANTLY CHANGE IN THE NEXT 12 MONTHS. GIVEN THE

NUMBER OF YEARS REMAINING SUBJECT TO EXAMINATION AND THE NUMBER

OF MATTERS BEING EXAMINED, WE ARE UNABLE TO ESTIMATE THE FULL

RANGE OF POSSIBLE ADJUSTMENTS TO THE BALANCE OF GROSS

UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS. HOWEVER, WE CAN REASONABLY EXPECT A

MINIMUM REDUCTION OF $80 MILLION OF OUR EXISTING GROSS

UNREALIZED TAX BENEFITS UPON SETTLEMENT OR EFFECTIVE SETTLEMENT

WITH THE VARIOUS TAX AUTHORITIES, THE CLOSURE OF CERTAIN AUDITS,

AND THE LAPSE OF STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS.

IN VARIOUS ACTIONS IN VIOLATION OF THE SHERMAN ACT AND THE

CALIFORNIA BUSINESS AND PROFESSIONS CODE, INCLUDING, AMONG OTHER

THINGS, PROVIDING DISCOUNTS AND REBATES TO OUR MANUFACTURER AND

DISTRIBUTOR CUSTOMERS CONDITIONED ON EXCLUSIVE OR NEAR EXCLUSIVE

DEALING THAT ALLEGEDLY UNFAIRLY INTERFERED WITH AMDS

ABILITY TO SELL ITS MICROPROCESSORS, INTERFERING WITH CERTAIN

PARTICIPATION IN CERTAIN INDUSTRY STANDARDS-SETTING GROUPS.

AMDS COMPLAINT SEEKS UNSPECIFIED TREBLE DAMAGES, PUNITIVE

DAMAGES, AN INJUNCTION REQUIRING INTEL TO CEASE ANY CONDUCT

FOUND TO BE UNLAWFUL, AND ATTORNEYS FEES AND COSTS. WE

HAVE ANSWERED THE COMPLAINT, DENYING THE MATERIAL ALLEGATIONS

AND ASSERTING VARIOUS AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSES. THE DISCOVERY

CUT-OFF OF THE AMD LITIGATION IS SET FOR MAY 1, 2009. IN

AND REPORT ON THOSE LAPSES, AS WELL AS DEVELOP A PLAN TO

REMEDIATE THE ISSUES. WE COMPLETED THE INVESTIGATION AND

PROVIDED DETAILED INFORMATION TO THE COURT AND AMD THROUGHOUT

WHICH IS NOW ALMOST COMPLETED. THE COURT GRANTED OUR REQUEST FOR

ANTITRUST REGULATORY INQUIRIES. IN 2001, THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION

(EC) COMMENCED AN INVESTIGATION REGARDING CLAIMS BY AMD THAT WE

USED UNFAIR BUSINESS PRACTICES TO PERSUADE CLIENTS TO BUY OUR

MICROPROCESSORS. THE EC SENT US A STATEMENT OF OBJECTIONS (SO)

IN JULY 2007 ALLEGING THAT CERTAIN INTEL MARKETING AND PRICING

PRACTICES AMOUNTED TO AN ABUSE OF A DOMINANT POSITION THAT

INFRINGED EUROPEAN LAW. THE SO RECOGNIZED THAT SUCH ALLEGATIONS

ARE PRELIMINARY, NOT FINAL, CONCLUSIONS. WE RESPONDED TO THOSE

ALLEGATIONS IN JANUARY 2008, AND A HEARING WAS HELD IN MARCH

2008. IN FEBRUARY 2008, THE EC INITIATED AN INSPECTION OF

DOCUMENTS AT OUR FELDKIRCHEN, GERMANY OFFICES. WE ALSO RECEIVED

ADDITIONAL REQUESTS FOR INFORMATION FROM THE EC. ON

JULY 17, 2008, THE EC SENT US A SUPPLEMENTARY STATEMENT OF

OBJECTIONS (SSO) ALLEGING THAT CERTAIN INTEL MARKETING AND

PRICING PRACTICES AMOUNTED TO AN ABUSE OF A DOMINANT POSITION

THAT INFRINGED EUROPEAN LAW. THE SSO RECOGNIZES THAT SUCH

ALLEGATIONS ARE PRELIMINARY, NOT FINAL, CONCLUSIONS.

IN OCTOBER 2008, WE FILED AN

APPEAL WITH THE COURT OF FIRST INSTANCE (CFI) IN EUROPE RELATED

TO PROCEDURAL RULINGS OF THE EC CONCERNING INTELS RESPONSE

TO THE SSO. IN THE APPEAL, WE ASKED THE CFI TO OVERRULE EC

DECISIONS THAT LIMIT THE EVIDENCE AVAILABLE TO INTEL AND THAT WE

BELIEVE WILL HINDER INTELS ABILITY TO CONDUCT A FAIR AND

EFFECTIVE DEFENSE AGAINST THE ALLEGATIONS CONTAINED IN THE SSO.

ON JANUARY 27, 2009, THE CFI REJECTED INTELS APPEAL,

RULING THAT INTELS REQUESTS WERE INADMISSIBLE AND WOULD

NOT BE CONSIDERED BY THE COURT AT THIS TIME. INTEL FILED A

RESPONSE TO THE SSO ON FEBRUARY 5, 2009.

ON DECEMBER 19, 2008, INTEL

RECEIVED A LETTER OF FACT FROM THE EC, WHICH

INCLUDED ADDITIONAL EVIDENTIARY MATERIAL RELATED TO THE ORIGINAL

SO THAT THE EC PROVIDED TO INTEL AS A COURTESY AND

NOT BECAUSE OF ANY OBLIGATION TO DO SO. IN ADDITION,

THE EC STATED THAT IT CANNOT BE EXCLUDED AT THIS STAGE OF

THE PROCEDURE THAT THE [EC] MAY ADOPT A DECISION ADVERSE

TO INTEL PURSUANT TO ARTICLE 7 OF THE COUNCIL REGULATION ON

THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE RULES ON COMPETITION LAID DOWN IN

ARTICLES 81 AND 82 OF THE EC TREATY. THE ECS LETTER

OUTLINED CERTAIN ALLEGED EVIDENCE THAT THE EC MAY RELY ON IN

REACHING ANY SUCH DECISION.

WITH RESPECT TO BOTH THE SO AND

THE SSO, THE OPTIONS AVAILABLE TO THE EC INCLUDE TAKING NO

ACTION, IMPOSING A MONETARY FINE,

AND/OR

ORDERING INTEL TO MODIFY OR TERMINATE CERTAIN MARKETING AND

PRICING PRACTICES. THE ECS RULES PROVIDE THAT THE MAXIMUM

MONETARY FINE COULD EQUAL 10% OF INTELS GLOBAL TURNOVER

FOR ALL PRODUCTS AND SERVICES FOR THE PRIOR FISCAL YEAR. ANY

SUCH DECISION WOULD BE SUBJECT TO APPEAL. INTEL LACKS SUFFICIENT

INFORMATION TO PREDICT THE ECS FUTURE COURSE OF ACTION,

AND BOTH THE OUTCOME AND THE RANGE OF ANY POTENTIAL ACTIONS BY

THE EC ARE NOT REASONABLY ESTIMABLE.

IN JUNE 2005, WE RECEIVED AN

INQUIRY FROM THE KOREA FAIR TRADE COMMISSION (KFTC) REQUESTING

DOCUMENTS FROM OUR KOREAN SUBSIDIARY RELATED TO MARKETING AND

REBATE PROGRAMS THAT WE ENTERED INTO WITH KOREAN PC

INSPECTION OF DOCUMENTS AT OUR OFFICES IN KOREA. IN SEPTEMBER

2007, THE KFTC SERVED US AN EXAMINATION REPORT ALLEGING THAT

SALES TO TWO CUSTOMERS DURING PARTS OF 20022005 VIOLATED

KOREAS MONOPOLY REGULATION AND FAIR TRADE ACT. IN DECEMBER

2007, WE SUBMITTED OUR WRITTEN RESPONSE TO THE KFTC. IN FEBRUARY

2008, THE KFTCS EXAMINER SUBMITTED A WRITTEN REPLY TO OUR

RESPONSE. IN MARCH, WE SUBMITTED A FURTHER RESPONSE. IN APRIL,

WE PARTICIPATED IN A PRE-HEARING CONFERENCE BEFORE THE KFTC, AND

WE PARTICIPATED IN FORMAL HEARINGS IN MAY AND JUNE 2008. IN JUNE

2008, THE KFTC ANNOUNCED ITS INTENT TO FINE US APPROXIMATELY

INTEL

CORPORATION V. COMMONWEALTH SCIENTIFIC AND INDUSTRIAL

RESEARCH ORGANISATION (CSIRO)

IN MAY 2005, INTEL FILED A LAWSUIT

IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF

CALIFORNIA AGAINST CSIRO, AN AUSTRALIAN RESEARCH INSTITUTE.

CSIRO HAD SENT LETTERS TO INTEL CUSTOMERS CLAIMING THAT PRODUCTS

COMPLIANT WITH THE IEEE 802.11A AND 802.11G STANDARDS INFRINGE

CSIROS U.S. PATENT NO. 5,487,069 (THE 069

PATENT). INTELS LAWSUIT SEEKS A DECLARATION THAT THE CSIRO

PATENT IS INVALID AND THAT NO INTEL PRODUCT INFRINGES IT. DELL

INC. IS A CO-DECLARATORY JUDGMENT PLAINTIFF WITH INTEL;

MICROSOFT CORPORATION, NETGEAR INC., AND HEWLETT-PACKARD COMPANY

FILED A SIMILAR, SEPARATE LAWSUIT AGAINST CSIRO. IN ITS AMENDED

ANSWER, CSIRO CLAIMED THAT VARIOUS INTEL PRODUCTS THAT PRACTICE

THE IEEE 802.11A, 802.11G,

AND/OR

DRAFT

802.11N STANDARDS INFRINGE THE 069 PATENT. TRIAL IS SET

FOR APRIL 13, 2009. CSIROS COMPLAINT SEEKS, AMONG

OTHER REMEDIES, INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND DAMAGES. CSIRO HAS STATED

IN PRE-TRIAL PROCEEDINGS THAT IT INTENDS TO SEEK DAMAGES IN THE

FORM OF A ROYALTY FOR ALLEGED INFRINGEMENT IN AN AMOUNT THAT, IF

CSIRO PREVAILED ON ITS CLAIMS AGAINST ALL DEFENDANTS, COULD

RESULT IN A JUDGMENT AGAINST INTEL IN EXCESS OF

$400 MILLION. IN A SEPARATE LAWSUIT (IN WHICH INTEL IS NOT

INVOLVED) AGAINST A THIRD-PARTY VENDOR OF WIRELESS NETWORKING

PRODUCTS BASED ON THE SAME PATENT AT ISSUE IN THE INTEL

LITIGATION, PENDING IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE

EASTERN DISTRICT OF TEXAS, THE COURT GRANTED CSIROS

MOTIONS FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT ON THE ISSUES OF VALIDITY AND

INFRINGEMENT, AND GRANTED A PERMANENT INJUNCTION IN FAVOR OF

CSIRO. IN SEPTEMBER 2008, THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR

THE FEDERAL CIRCUIT AFFIRMED IN PART AND REVERSED IN PART THAT

RULING, CONCLUDING THAT THE PATENT WAS INFRINGED BY THE

THIRD-PARTIES PRODUCTS, BUT THAT THE DISTRICT COURT ERRED

IN CONCLUDING, AS A MATTER OF LAW, THAT THE PATENT IS VALID.

INTEL DISPUTES CSIROS CLAIMS AND INTENDS TO DEFEND THE

LAWSUIT VIGOROUSLY.

PROCESSORS AND A COMPETITORS MICROPROCESSORS. IN JULY

2004, THE COURT CERTIFIED AGAINST US AN ILLINOIS-ONLY CLASS OF

CERTAIN END-USE PURCHASERS OF CERTAIN PENTIUM 4 PROCESSORS OR

COMPUTERS CONTAINING THESE MICROPROCESSORS. IN JANUARY 2005, THE

COURT GRANTED A MOTION FILED JOINTLY BY THE PLAINTIFFS AND INTEL

THAT STAYED THE PROCEEDINGS IN THE TRIAL COURT PENDING

DISCRETIONARY APPELLATE REVIEW OF THE COURTS CLASS

CERTIFICATION ORDER. IN JULY 2006, THE ILLINOIS APPELLATE COURT,

FIFTH DISTRICT, VACATED THE TRIAL COURTS CLASS

CERTIFICATION ORDER. THE APPELLATE COURT INSTRUCTED THE TRIAL

COURT TO RECONSIDER WHETHER CALIFORNIA LAW SHOULD APPLY.

HOWEVER, IN AUGUST 2006, THE ILLINOIS SUPREME COURT AGREED TO

REVIEW THE APPELLATE COURTS DECISION. IN NOVEMBER 2007,

THE ILLINOIS SUPREME COURT ISSUED ITS OPINION FINDING IN FAVOR

OF INTEL ON TWO ISSUES. FIRST, ON THE ISSUE OF WHETHER ILLINOIS

OR CALIFORNIA LAW APPLIES TO THE CLAIMS OF ILLINOIS RESIDENTS

FOR GOODS PURCHASED IN ILLINOIS, THE COURT FOUND THAT ILLINOIS

LAW APPLIES, REJECTING THE APPELLATE COURTS FINDING OF A

NATIONWIDE CLASS BASED ON APPLICATION OF THE CALIFORNIA LAW.

SECOND, ON THE ISSUE OF WHETHER ANY CLASS SHOULD BE CERTIFIED IN

THIS CASE AT ALL, THE COURT HELD THAT NO CLASS SHOULD BE

CERTIFIED, REVERSING THE TRIAL COURTS FINDING OF AN

ILLINOIS-ONLY CLASS BASED ON ILLINOIS LAW. THE CASE WAS REMANDED

TO THE TRIAL COURT, AND IN MARCH 2008 AN ORDER WAS ENTERED

DISMISSING THE CASE WITH PREJUDICE BASED ON OUR MOTION TO

DISMISS.

INTEL ACQUIRED LIGHTLOGIC, INC. IN

MAY 2001. FRANK SHUM HAS SUED INTEL, LIGHTLOGIC, AND

LIGHTLOGICS FOUNDER, JEAN-MARC VERDIELL, CLAIMING THAT

MUCH OF LIGHTLOGICS INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY IS BASED ON

ALLEGED INVENTIONS THAT SHUM CONCEIVED WHILE HE AND VERDIELL

WERE PARTNERS AT RADIANCE DESIGN, INC. SHUM HAS ALLEGED CLAIMS

FOR FRAUD, BREACH OF FIDUCIARY DUTY, FRAUDULENT CONCEALMENT, AND

BREACH OF CONTRACT. SHUM ALSO SEEKS ALLEGED CORRECTION OF

INVENTORSHIP OF SEVEN PATENTS ACQUIRED BY INTEL AS PART OF THE

LIGHTLOGIC ACQUISITION. IN JANUARY 2005, THE U.S. DISTRICT

COURT FOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA DENIED SHUMS

INVENTORSHIP CLAIM, AND THEREAFTER GRANTED INTELS MOTION

FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT ON SHUMS REMAINING CLAIMS. IN AUGUST

2007, THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE FEDERAL CIRCUIT

VACATED THE DISTRICT COURTS RULINGS AND REMANDED THE CASE

FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS. IN OCTOBER 2008, THE DISTRICT COURT

GRANTED INTELS MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT ON SHUMS

CLAIMS FOR BREACH OF FIDUCIARY DUTY AND FRAUDULENT CONCEALMENT,

BUT DENIED INTELS MOTION ON SHUMS REMAINING CLAIMS.

A JURY TRIAL ON SHUMS REMAINING CLAIMS TOOK PLACE IN

NOVEMBER AND DECEMBER 2008. IN PRE-TRIAL PROCEEDINGS AND AT

TRIAL, SHUM REQUESTED MONETARY DAMAGES AGAINST THE DEFENDANTS IN

AMOUNTS RANGING FROM $31 MILLION TO $931 MILLION, AND

HIS FINAL REQUEST TO THE JURY WAS FOR AS MUCH AS

$175 MILLION. FOLLOWING DELIBERATIONS, THE JURY WAS UNABLE

TO REACH A VERDICT ON MOST OF THE CLAIMS. WITH RESPECT TO

SHUMS CLAIM THAT HE IS THE PROPER INVENTOR ON CERTAIN

LIGHTLOGIC PATENTS NOW ASSIGNED TO INTEL, THE JURY AGREED WITH

SHUM ON SOME OF THOSE CLAIMS. BUT THE JURY WAS UNABLE TO REACH A

VERDICT ON THE BREACH OF CONTRACT, FRAUD, OR UNJUST ENRICHMENT

CLAIMS. ALL PARTIES HAVE FILED POST-TRIAL MOTIONS, WHICH THE

COURT IS CURRENTLY CONSIDERING. INTEL DISPUTES SHUMS

CLAIMS AND INTENDS TO DEFEND THE LAWSUIT VIGOROUSLY.

CORPORATION

IN FEBRUARY 2008, MARTIN SMILOW,

AN INTEL STOCKHOLDER, FILED A PUTATIVE DERIVATIVE ACTION IN THE

UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE

AGAINST MEMBERS OF OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS. THE COMPLAINT ALLEGES

GENERALLY THAT THE BOARD ALLOWED THE COMPANY TO VIOLATE

ANTITRUST AND OTHER LAWS, AS DESCRIBED IN AMDS ANTITRUST

LAWSUITS AGAINST US, AND THAT THOSE BOARD-SANCTIONED ACTIVITIES

HAVE HARMED THE COMPANY. THE COMPLAINT REPEATS MANY OF

AMDS ALLEGATIONS AND REFERENCES VARIOUS INVESTIGATIONS BY

THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITY, KOREAN FAIR TRADE COMMISSION, AND

OTHERS. IN FEBRUARY 2008, A SECOND PLAINTIFF, EVAN TOBIAS, FILED

A DERIVATIVE SUIT IN THE SAME COURT AGAINST THE BOARD CONTAINING

MANY OF THE SAME ALLEGATIONS AS IN THE SMILOW SUIT. ON

JULY 30, 2008, THE DISTRICT COURT ENTERED AN ORDER

DIRECTING SMILOW AND TOBIAS TO FILE A SINGLE, CONSOLIDATED

COMPLAINT BY AUGUST 7, 2008 AND DIRECTING US TO RESPOND

WITHIN 30 DAYS THEREAFTER. AN AMENDED CONSOLIDATED

COMPLAINT WAS FILED ON AUGUST 7, 2008. ON JUNE 27,

2008, A THIRD PLAINTIFF, CHRISTINE DEL GAIZO, FILED A DERIVATIVE

SUIT IN THE SANTA CLARA COUNTY SUPERIOR COURT AGAINST THE

BOARD, A FORMER DIRECTOR OF THE BOARD, AND SIX OF OUR OFFICERS,

CONTAINING MANY OF THE SAME ALLEGATIONS AS IN THE SMILOW AND

TOBIAS SUITS. ON AUGUST 27, 2008, THE PARTIES IN THE

CALIFORNIA DERIVATIVE SUIT ENTERED INTO A STIPULATION TO STAY

THE ACTION PENDING FURTHER ORDER OF THE COURT, AND THE COURT

ENTERED AN ORDER TO THAT EFFECT ON SEPTEMBER 2, 2008. WE

DENY THE ALLEGATIONS AND INTEND TO DEFEND THE LAWSUITS

VIGOROUSLY. ON SEPTEMBER 5, 2008, ALL OF THE DEFENDANTS IN

THE DELAWARE DERIVATIVE ACTION FILED A MOTION TO DISMISS THE

COMPLAINT. BRIEFING ON THE DEFENDANTS MOTION IS COMPLETE

AND A RULING IS EXPECTED IN EARLY 2009.

OPERATING SEGMENT AND GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION

AS OF DECEMBER 27, 2008, OUR

OPERATING SEGMENTS INCLUDED THE DIGITAL ENTERPRISE GROUP,

MOBILITY GROUP, NAND SOLUTIONS GROUP, DIGITAL HOME GROUP,

DIGITAL HEALTH GROUP, AND SOFTWARE AND SERVICES GROUP.

IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2008, WE

COMPLETED A REORGANIZATION THAT TRANSFERRED THE REVENUE AND

COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH A PORTION OF THE DIGITAL HOME GROUPS

CONSUMER PC COMPONENTS BUSINESS TO THE DIGITAL ENTERPRISE GROUP.

THE DIGITAL HOME GROUP NOW FOCUSES ON THE CONSUMER ELECTRONICS

COMPONENTS BUSINESS. WE ADJUSTED OUR HISTORICAL RESULTS TO

REFLECT THIS REORGANIZATION. PRIOR-PERIOD AMOUNTS HAVE ALSO BEEN

ADJUSTED RETROSPECTIVELY TO REFLECT OTHER MINOR REORGANIZATIONS.

THE CHIEF OPERATING DECISION MAKER

(CODM), AS DEFINED BY SFAS NO. 131, DISCLOSURES

ABOUT SEGMENTS OF AN ENTERPRISE AND RELATED INFORMATION

(SFAS NO. 131), IS OUR PRESIDENT AND CEO. THE CODM

ALLOCATES RESOURCES TO AND ASSESSES THE PERFORMANCE OF EACH

OPERATING SEGMENT USING INFORMATION ABOUT ITS REVENUE AND

OPERATING INCOME (LOSS) BEFORE INTEREST AND TAXES.

WE REPORT THE FINANCIAL RESULTS OF

THE FOLLOWING OPERATING SEGMENTS.



DIGITAL ENTERPRISE

GROUP.

INCLUDES

MICROPROCESSORS AND RELATED CHIPSETS AND MOTHERBOARDS DESIGNED

FOR THE DESKTOP (INCLUDING HIGH-END ENTHUSIAST PCS), NETTOP, AND

ENTERPRISE COMPUTING MARKET SEGMENTS; MICROPROCESSORS AND

RELATED CHIPSETS FOR EMBEDDED APPLICATIONS; COMMUNICATIONS

INFRASTRUCTURE COMPONENTS SUCH AS NETWORK PROCESSORS AND

COMMUNICATIONS BOARDS; WIRED CONNECTIVITY DEVICES; AND PRODUCTS

FOR NETWORK AND SERVER STORAGE.



MOBILITY

GROUP.

INCLUDES

MICROPROCESSORS AND RELATED CHIPSETS DESIGNED FOR THE NOTEBOOK

AND NETBOOK MARKET SEGMENTS, WIRELESS CONNECTIVITY PRODUCTS, AND

PRODUCTS DESIGNED FOR THE ULTRA-MOBILE MARKET SEGMENT, WHICH

INCLUDES MOBILE INTERNET DEVICES. IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2006,

WE COMPLETED THE SALE OF CERTAIN ASSETS OF OUR COMMUNICATIONS

AND APPLICATION PROCESSOR BUSINESS LINES TO MARVELL. RELATED TO

THE SALE, WE ENTERED INTO A MANUFACTURING AND TRANSITION

SERVICES AGREEMENT WITH MARVELL. AS A RESULT, OUR SALES OF

APPLICATION AND CELLULAR BASEBAND PROCESSORS IN 2007 AND 2008

WERE ONLY TO MARVELL.

THE NAND SOLUTIONS GROUP, DIGITAL

HOME GROUP, DIGITAL HEALTH GROUP, AND SOFTWARE AND SERVICES

GROUP OPERATING SEGMENTS DO NOT MEET THE QUANTITATIVE THRESHOLDS

FOR REPORTABLE SEGMENTS AS DEFINED BY SFAS NO. 131 AND

ARE INCLUDED WITHIN THE ALL OTHER CATEGORY.

WE HAVE SALES AND MARKETING,

MANUFACTURING, FINANCE, AND ADMINISTRATION GROUPS. EXPENSES FOR

THESE GROUPS ARE GENERALLY ALLOCATED TO THE OPERATING SEGMENTS,

AND THE EXPENSES ARE INCLUDED IN THE OPERATING RESULTS REPORTED

BELOW. ADDITIONALLY, IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2007, WE STARTED

INCLUDING SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION IN THE COMPUTATION OF

OPERATING INCOME (LOSS) FOR EACH OPERATING SEGMENT AND ADJUSTED

PRIOR RESULTS TO REFLECT THIS CHANGE. REVENUE FOR THE ALL OTHER

CATEGORY IS PRIMARILY RELATED TO THE SALE OF NAND FLASH MEMORY

PRODUCTS, MICROPROCESSORS AND RELATED CHIPSETS BY THE DIGITAL

HOME GROUP, AND NOR FLASH MEMORY PRODUCTS. IN THE SECOND QUARTER

OF 2008, WE COMPLETED THE DIVESTITURE OF OUR NOR FLASH MEMORY

ASSETS TO NUMONYX. AT THAT TIME, WE ENTERED INTO SUPPLY AND

SERVICE AGREEMENTS TO PROVIDE PRODUCTS, SERVICES, AND SUPPORT TO

NUMONYX FOLLOWING THE CLOSE OF THE TRANSACTION. REVENUE AND

EXPENSES RELATED TO THE SUPPLY AND SERVICE AGREEMENTS ARE

INCLUDED IN THE ALL OTHER CATEGORY. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ON

NUMONYX, SEE NOTE 6: EQUITY METHOD AND COST METHOD

INVESTMENTS.

THE ALL OTHER CATEGORY INCLUDES

CERTAIN CORPORATE-LEVEL OPERATING EXPENSES AND CHARGES. THESE

EXPENSES AND CHARGES INCLUDE.



A PORTION OF PROFIT-DEPENDENT

BONUSES AND OTHER EXPENSES NOT ALLOCATED TO THE OPERATING

SEGMENTS;



RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OF SEED

BUSINESSES THAT SUPPORT OUR INITIATIVES;



ACQUISITION-RELATED COSTS,

INCLUDING AMORTIZATION AND ANY IMPAIRMENT OF ACQUISITION-RELATED

INTANGIBLES AND GOODWILL;



CHARGES FOR PURCHASED IN-PROCESS

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT; AND



AMOUNTS INCLUDED WITHIN

RESTRUCTURING AND ASSET IMPAIRMENT CHARGES.

WITH THE EXCEPTION OF GOODWILL, WE

DO NOT IDENTIFY OR ALLOCATE ASSETS BY OPERATING SEGMENT, NOR

DOES THE CODM EVALUATE OPERATING SEGMENTS USING DISCRETE ASSET

INFORMATION. OPERATING SEGMENTS DO NOT RECORD INTER-SEGMENT

REVENUE, AND, ACCORDINGLY, THERE IS NONE TO BE REPORTED. WE DO

NOT ALLOCATE GAINS AND LOSSES FROM EQUITY INVESTMENTS, INTEREST

AND OTHER INCOME, OR TAXES TO OPERATING SEGMENTS. ALTHOUGH THE

CODM USES OPERATING INCOME TO EVALUATE THE SEGMENTS, OPERATING

COSTS INCLUDED IN ONE SEGMENT MAY BENEFIT OTHER SEGMENTS. EXCEPT

AS DISCUSSED ABOVE, THE ACCOUNTING POLICIES FOR SEGMENT

REPORTING ARE THE SAME AS FOR INTEL AS A WHOLE.

WE HAVE AUDITED THE ACCOMPANYING

CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS OF INTEL CORPORATION AS OF

DECEMBER 27, 2008 AND DECEMBER 29, 2007, AND THE

RELATED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME, STOCKHOLDERS

EQUITY, AND CASH FLOWS FOR EACH OF THE THREE YEARS IN THE PERIOD

ENDED DECEMBER 27, 2008. OUR AUDITS ALSO INCLUDED THE

FINANCIAL STATEMENT SCHEDULE LISTED IN THE INDEX AT

PART IV, ITEM 15. THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND

SCHEDULE ARE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE COMPANYS

MANAGEMENT. OUR RESPONSIBILITY IS TO EXPRESS AN OPINION ON THESE

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SCHEDULE BASED ON OUR AUDITS.

WE CONDUCTED OUR AUDITS IN

ACCORDANCE WITH THE STANDARDS OF THE PUBLIC COMPANY ACCOUNTING

OVERSIGHT BOARD (UNITED STATES). THOSE STANDARDS REQUIRE THAT WE

PLAN AND PERFORM THE AUDIT TO OBTAIN REASONABLE ASSURANCE ABOUT

WHETHER THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE FREE OF MATERIAL

MISSTATEMENT. AN AUDIT INCLUDES EXAMINING, ON A TEST BASIS,

EVIDENCE SUPPORTING THE AMOUNTS AND DISCLOSURES IN THE FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS. AN AUDIT ALSO INCLUDES ASSESSING THE ACCOUNTING

PRINCIPLES USED AND SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES MADE BY MANAGEMENT, AS

WELL AS EVALUATING THE OVERALL FINANCIAL STATEMENT PRESENTATION.

WE BELIEVE THAT OUR AUDITS PROVIDE A REASONABLE BASIS FOR OUR

OPINION.

IN OUR OPINION, THE FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS REFERRED TO ABOVE PRESENT FAIRLY, IN ALL MATERIAL

RESPECTS, THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL POSITION OF INTEL

CORPORATION AT DECEMBER 27, 2008 AND DECEMBER 29,

2007, AND THE CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF ITS OPERATIONS AND ITS

CASH FLOWS FOR EACH OF THE THREE YEARS IN THE PERIOD ENDED

DECEMBER 27, 2008, IN CONFORMITY WITH U.S. GENERALLY

ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES. ALSO, IN OUR OPINION, THE

RELATED FINANCIAL STATEMENT SCHEDULE, WHEN CONSIDERED IN

RELATION TO THE BASIC FINANCIAL STATEMENTS TAKEN AS A WHOLE,

PRESENTS FAIRLY IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS THE INFORMATION SET

FORTH THEREIN.

AS DISCUSSED IN NOTES 2 AND

23 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, INTEL CORPORATION

CHANGED ITS METHOD OF ACCOUNTING FOR SABBATICAL LEAVE AS OF

WE HAVE AUDITED INTEL

CORPORATIONS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS

OF DECEMBER 27, 2008, BASED ON CRITERIA ESTABLISHED IN

INTERNAL CONTROLINTEGRATED FRAMEWORK ISSUED BY THE

COMMITTEE OF SPONSORING ORGANIZATIONS OF THE TREADWAY COMMISSION

(THE COSO CRITERIA). INTEL CORPORATIONS MANAGEMENT IS

RESPONSIBLE FOR MAINTAINING EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER

FINANCIAL REPORTING, AND FOR ITS ASSESSMENT OF THE EFFECTIVENESS

OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING INCLUDED IN THE

ACCOMPANYING MANAGEMENT REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER

FINANCIAL REPORTING. OUR RESPONSIBILITY IS TO EXPRESS AN OPINION

ON THE COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

BASED ON OUR AUDIT.

WE CONDUCTED OUR AUDIT IN

ACCORDANCE WITH THE STANDARDS OF THE PUBLIC COMPANY ACCOUNTING

OVERSIGHT BOARD (UNITED STATES). THOSE STANDARDS REQUIRE THAT WE

PLAN AND PERFORM THE AUDIT TO OBTAIN REASONABLE ASSURANCE ABOUT

WHETHER EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING WAS

MAINTAINED IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS. OUR AUDIT INCLUDED

OBTAINING AN UNDERSTANDING OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL

REPORTING, ASSESSING THE RISK THAT A MATERIAL WEAKNESS EXISTS,

TESTING AND EVALUATING THE DESIGN AND OPERATING EFFECTIVENESS OF

INTERNAL CONTROL BASED ON THE ASSESSED RISK, AND PERFORMING SUCH

OTHER PROCEDURES AS WE CONSIDERED NECESSARY IN THE

CIRCUMSTANCES. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR AUDIT PROVIDES A REASONABLE

BASIS FOR OUR OPINION.

A COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL

OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING IS A PROCESS DESIGNED TO PROVIDE

REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING THE RELIABILITY OF FINANCIAL

REPORTING AND THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR

EXTERNAL PURPOSES IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED

ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES. A COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER

FINANCIAL REPORTING INCLUDES THOSE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES THAT

(1) PERTAIN TO THE MAINTENANCE OF RECORDS THAT, IN

REASONABLE DETAIL, ACCURATELY AND FAIRLY REFLECT THE

TRANSACTIONS AND DISPOSITIONS OF THE ASSETS OF THE COMPANY;

(2) PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE THAT TRANSACTIONS ARE

RECORDED AS NECESSARY TO PERMIT PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING

PRINCIPLES, AND THAT RECEIPTS AND EXPENDITURES OF THE COMPANY

ARE BEING MADE ONLY IN ACCORDANCE WITH AUTHORIZATIONS OF

MANAGEMENT AND DIRECTORS OF THE COMPANY; AND (3) PROVIDE

REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING PREVENTION OR TIMELY DETECTION OF

UNAUTHORIZED ACQUISITION, USE, OR DISPOSITION OF THE

COMPANYS ASSETS THAT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

BECAUSE OF ITS INHERENT

LIMITATIONS, INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING MAY NOT

PREVENT OR DETECT MISSTATEMENTS. ALSO, PROJECTIONS OF ANY

EVALUATION OF EFFECTIVENESS TO FUTURE PERIODS ARE SUBJECT TO THE

RISK THAT CONTROLS MAY BECOME INADEQUATE BECAUSE OF CHANGES IN

CONDITIONS, OR THAT THE DEGREE OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE POLICIES

OR PROCEDURES MAY DETERIORATE.

IN OUR OPINION, INTEL CORPORATION

MAINTAINED, IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS, EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL

OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF DECEMBER 27, 2008, BASED ON

THE COSO CRITERIA.

WE ALSO HAVE AUDITED, IN

ACCORDANCE WITH THE STANDARDS OF THE PUBLIC COMPANY ACCOUNTING

OVERSIGHT BOARD (UNITED STATES), THE 2008 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS OF INTEL CORPORATION AND OUR REPORT DATED

FEBRUARY 17, 2009 EXPRESSED AN UNQUALIFIED OPINION THEREON.

ISSUED AN ATTESTATION REPORT CONCURRING WITH MANAGEMENTS

ASSESSMENT, WHICH IS INCLUDED AT THE END OF PART II,

ITEM 8 OF THIS

FORM 10-K.

INHERENT

LIMITATIONS ON EFFECTIVENESS OF CONTROLS

OUR MANAGEMENT, INCLUDING THE CEO

AND CFO, DOES NOT EXPECT THAT OUR DISCLOSURE CONTROLS OR OUR

INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING WILL PREVENT OR DETECT

ALL ERROR AND ALL FRAUD. A CONTROL SYSTEM, NO MATTER HOW WELL

DESIGNED AND OPERATED, CAN PROVIDE ONLY REASONABLE, NOT

ABSOLUTE, ASSURANCE THAT THE CONTROL SYSTEMS OBJECTIVES

WILL BE MET. THE DESIGN OF A CONTROL SYSTEM MUST REFLECT THE

FACT THAT THERE ARE RESOURCE CONSTRAINTS, AND THE BENEFITS OF

CONTROLS MUST BE CONSIDERED RELATIVE TO THEIR COSTS. FURTHER,

BECAUSE OF THE INHERENT LIMITATIONS IN ALL CONTROL SYSTEMS, NO

EVALUATION OF CONTROLS CAN PROVIDE ABSOLUTE ASSURANCE THAT

MISSTATEMENTS DUE TO ERROR OR FRAUD WILL NOT OCCUR OR THAT ALL

CONTROL ISSUES AND INSTANCES OF FRAUD, IF ANY, HAVE BEEN

DETECTED. THESE INHERENT LIMITATIONS INCLUDE THE REALITIES THAT

JUDGMENTS IN DECISION-MAKING CAN BE FAULTY AND THAT BREAKDOWNS

CAN OCCUR BECAUSE OF SIMPLE ERROR OR MISTAKE. CONTROLS CAN ALSO

BE CIRCUMVENTED BY THE INDIVIDUAL ACTS OF SOME PERSONS, BY

COLLUSION OF TWO OR MORE PEOPLE, OR BY MANAGEMENT OVERRIDE OF

THE CONTROLS. THE DESIGN OF ANY SYSTEM OF CONTROLS IS BASED IN

PART ON CERTAIN ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT THE LIKELIHOOD OF FUTURE

EVENTS, AND THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT ANY DESIGN WILL

SUCCEED IN ACHIEVING ITS STATED GOALS UNDER ALL POTENTIAL FUTURE

CONDITIONS. PROJECTIONS OF ANY EVALUATION OF CONTROLS

EFFECTIVENESS TO FUTURE PERIODS ARE SUBJECT TO RISKS. OVER TIME,

CONTROLS MAY BECOME INADEQUATE BECAUSE OF CHANGES IN CONDITIONS

OR DETERIORATION IN THE DEGREE OF COMPLIANCE WITH POLICIES OR

PROCEDURES.
