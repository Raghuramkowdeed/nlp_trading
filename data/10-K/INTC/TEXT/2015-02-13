BUSINESS

COMPANY OVERVIEW

WE DESIGN AND MANUFACTURE ADVANCED INTEGRATED DIGITAL TECHNOLOGY PLATFORMS. A PLATFORM CONSISTS OF A MICROPROCESSOR AND CHIPSET, AND MAY BE ENHANCED BY ADDITIONAL HARDWARE, SOFTWARE, AND SERVICES. WE SELL THESE PLATFORMS PRIMARILY TO

ORIGINAL EQUIPMENT MANUFACTURERS

(OEMS),

ORIGINAL DESIGN MANUFACTURERS

(ODMS), AND

INDUSTRIAL AND COMMUNICATIONS EQUIPMENT MANUFACTURERS IN THE COMPUTING AND COMMUNICATIONS INDUSTRIES

. OUR PLATFORMS ARE USED TO DELIVER A WIDE RANGE OF COMPUTING EXPERIENCES IN NOTEBOOKS (INCLUDING ULTRABOOK

TM

DEVICES),  2 IN 1 SYSTEMS, DESKTOPS, SERVERS, TABLETS, SMARTPHONES, AND THE INTERNET OF THINGS (

INCLUDING WEARABLES, TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS, AND RETAIL DEVICES

). WE ALSO DEVELOP AND SELL SOFTWARE AND SERVICES PRIMARILY FOCUSED ON SECURITY AND TECHNOLOGY INTEGRATION. WE WERE INCORPORATED IN CALIFORNIA IN 1968 AND REINCORPORATED IN DELAWARE IN 1989.

COMPANY STRATEGY

OUR VISION IS IF IT IS SMART AND CONNECTED, IT IS BEST WITH INTEL. AS A RESULT, WE OFFER COMPLETE AND CONNECTED COMPUTING SOLUTIONS, BOTH HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE, AND CONTINUE TO DRIVE "MOORE’S LAW." OVER TIME, THE NUMBER OF DEVICES CONNECTED TO THE INTERNET AND TO ONE ANOTHER HAS GROWN FROM HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS TO BILLIONS. THIS NUMBER CONTINUES TO GROW AND THE VARIETY OF DEVICES ALSO CONTINUES TO INCREASE. THE COMBINATION OF EMBEDDING COMPUTING INTO DEVICES AND CONNECTING THEM TO THE INTERNET, KNOWN AS THE INTERNET OF THINGS, AS WELL AS A BUILD-OUT OF THE CLOUD INFRASTRUCTURE SUPPORTING THESE DEVICES, IS DRIVING FUNDAMENTAL CHANGES IN THE COMPUTING INDUSTRY. AS A RESULT, WE ARE TRANSFORMING OUR PRIMARY FOCUS FROM THE DESIGN AND MANUFACTURE OF SEMICONDUCTOR CHIPS FOR PERSONAL COMPUTERS (PCS) AND SERVERS TO THE DELIVERY OF MORE COMPLETE PLATFORM SOLUTIONS CONSISTING OF HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE PLATFORMS AND SUPPORTING SERVICES. THESE SOLUTIONS SPAN THE COMPUTE CONTINUUM, FROM HIGH-PERFORMANCE COMPUTING SYSTEMS RUNNING TRILLIONS OF OPERATIONS PER SECOND TO EMBEDDED APPLICATIONS CONSUMING MILLIWATTS OF POWER. ADDITIONALLY, COMPUTING IS BECOMING AN INCREASINGLY MOBILE, PERSONAL, AND UBIQUITOUS EXPERIENCE. END USERS VALUE SMART DEVICES THAT CONNECT SEAMLESSLY AND SECURELY TO THE INTERNET AND TO EACH OTHER. WE ENABLE THIS EXPERIENCE BY INNOVATING AROUND ENERGY-EFFICIENT PERFORMANCE, CONNECTIVITY, AND SECURITY.

TO SUCCEED IN THIS CHANGING COMPUTING ENVIRONMENT, WE HAVE THE FOLLOWING KEY OBJECTIVES.

•

RELENTLESS PURSUIT OF MOORE'S LAW TO MAXIMIZE AND EXTEND OUR MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY LEADERSHIP;

•

STRIVE TO ENSURE THAT INTEL

®

TECHNOLOGY IS THE BEST CHOICE ACROSS THE COMPUTE CONTINUUM, INCLUDING PCS, DATA CENTERS, ULTRA-MOBILE DEVICES, AND THE INTERNET OF THINGS;

•

EXPAND PLATFORMS INTO ADJACENT MARKET SEGMENTS TO BRING COMPELLING NEW SYSTEM-ON-CHIP (SOC) SOLUTIONS AND USER EXPERIENCES TO ULTRA-MOBILE FORM FACTORS INCLUDING TABLETS AND SMARTPHONES, AS WELL AS PC PLATFORMS (INCLUDING ULTRABOOK DEVICES, 2 IN 1 SYSTEMS, AND ALL-IN-ONES), DATA CENTER APPLICATIONS, AND THE INTERNET OF THINGS (

INCLUDING WEARABLES, TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS, AND RETAIL DEVICES

);

•

INCREASE THE UTILIZATION OF OUR INVESTMENTS IN INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT (R&D) ACROSS ALL MARKET SEGMENTS;

•

BE THE PLATFORM OF CHOICE FOR ANY OPERATING SYSTEM;

•

EXPAND DATA CENTER, SECURITY, AND BIG DATA ANALYTICS;

SILICON AND MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY LEADERSHIP.

WE HAVE LONG BEEN A LEADER IN SILICON PROCESS TECHNOLOGY AND MANUFACTURING, AND WE AIM TO CONTINUE OUR LEAD THROUGH INVESTMENT AND INNOVATION IN THIS CRITICAL AREA. MOORE'S LAW PREDICTED THAT TRANSISTOR DENSITY ON INTEGRATED CIRCUITS WOULD DOUBLE ABOUT EVERY TWO YEARS. WE CONTINUE EXECUTING TO MOORE’S LAW BY ENABLING

NEW DEVICES WITH HIGHER FUNCTIONALITY AND COMPLEXITY WHILE CONTROLLING POWER, COST, AND SIZE.

IN KEEPING WITH MOORE'S LAW, WE DRIVE A REGULAR AND PREDICTABLE UPGRADE CYCLE—INTRODUCING A NEW MICROARCHITECTURE

APPROXIMATELY EVERY TWO TO THREE YEARS AND RAMPING THE NEXT GENERATION OF SILICON PROCESS TECHNOLOGY IN THE INTERVENING PERIODS

. WE REFER TO THIS AS OUR "TICK-TOCK" TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT CADENCE. THROUGH THIS CYCLE, WE CONTINUE TO PUSH PROGRESS BY DESIGNING AND PUTTING TRANSISTOR INNOVATIONS INTO HIGH-VOLUME PRODUCTION. WE AIM TO HAVE THE BEST PROCESS TECHNOLOGY, AND UNLIKE MANY SEMICONDUCTOR COMPANIES, WE PRIMARILY MANUFACTURE OUR PRODUCTS IN OUR OWN FACILITIES. THIS IN-HOUSE MANUFACTURING CAPABILITY ENABLES US TO OPTIMIZE PERFORMANCE, SHORTEN OUR TIME TO MARKET, AND SCALE NEW PRODUCTS MORE RAPIDLY. WE BELIEVE THIS COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE WILL BE EXTENDED IN THE FUTURE AS THE COSTS TO BUILD LEADING-EDGE FABRICATION FACILITIES INCREASE, AND AS FEWER SEMICONDUCTOR COMPANIES WILL BE ABLE TO COMBINE PLATFORM DESIGN AND MANUFACTURING.

COMPETITION

THE COMPUTING INDUSTRY CONTINUOUSLY EVOLVES WITH NEW AND ENHANCED TECHNOLOGIES AND PRODUCTS FROM EXISTING AND NEW PROVIDERS. THE MARKETPLACE CAN CHANGE QUICKLY IN RESPONSE TO THE INTRODUCTION OF SUCH TECHNOLOGIES AND PRODUCTS AND OTHER FACTORS SUCH AS CHANGES IN CUSTOMER AND END-USER REQUIREMENTS, EXPECTATIONS, AND PREFERENCES. AS TECHNOLOGIES EVOLVE AND NEW MARKET SEGMENTS EMERGE, THE BOUNDARIES BETWEEN THE MARKET SEGMENTS THAT WE COMPETE IN ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO CHANGE.

INTEL FACES SIGNIFICANT COMPETITION IN THE DEVELOPMENT AND MARKET ACCEPTANCE OF OUR PRODUCTS IN THIS ENVIRONMENT. OUR PLATFORMS, BASED ON INTEL ARCHITECTURE, ARE POSITIONED TO COMPETE ACROSS THE COMPUTE CONTINUUM, FROM THE LOWEST POWER AND ULTRA-MOBILE DEVICES TO THE MOST POWERFUL DATA CENTER SERVERS. OUR PLATFORMS, WHICH HAVE INTEGRATED HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE, OFFER CUSTOMERS BENEFITS SUCH AS EASE OF USE, SAVINGS IN TOTAL COST OF OWNERSHIP, AND THE ABILITY TO SCALE SYSTEMS TO ACCOMMODATE INCREASED USAGE.

COMPETITORS

WE COMPETE AGAINST OTHER COMPANIES THAT MAKE AND SELL PLATFORMS, OTHER SILICON COMPONENTS, AND SOFTWARE TO BUSINESSES THAT BUILD AND SELL COMPUTING AND COMMUNICATIONS DEVICES TO END USERS. OUR COMPETITORS ALSO INCLUDE COMPANIES THAT SELL GOODS AND SERVICES TO BUSINESSES THAT UTILIZE THEM FOR THEIR INTERNAL AND/OR CUSTOMER-FACING PROCESSES (E.G., BUSINESSES RUNNING LARGE DATA CENTERS). IN ADDITION, WE FACE COMPETITION FROM OEMS, ODMS, AND OTHER INDUSTRIAL AND COMMUNICATIONS EQUIPMENT MANUFACTURERS THAT, TO SOME DEGREE, CHOOSE TO VERTICALLY INTEGRATE THEIR OWN PROPRIETARY SEMICONDUCTOR AND SOFTWARE ASSETS. BY DOING SO, THESE COMPETITORS MAY BE ATTEMPTING TO OFFER GREATER DIFFERENTIATION IN THEIR PRODUCTS AND TO INCREASE THEIR SHARE OF THE PROFITS FOR EACH FINISHED PRODUCT THEY SELL. CONTINUING CHANGES IN INDUSTRY PARTICIPANTS THROUGH, FOR EXAMPLE, ACQUISITIONS OR BUSINESS COLLABORATIONS COULD ALSO HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON OUR COMPETITIVE POSITION.

WE ARE A LEADING PROVIDER IN THE PC AND DATA CENTER SEGMENTS, WHERE WE FACE EXISTING AND EMERGING COMPETITION. IN THE PC MARKET SEGMENT, ULTRA-MOBILE DEVICES—SUCH AS TABLETS AND SMARTPHONES OFFERED BY NUMEROUS VENDORS— HAVE BECOME SIGNIFICANT COMPETITORS TO PCS FOR MANY USAGES. MOST OF THESE SMALL DEVICES CURRENTLY USE APPLICATIONS PROCESSORS BASED ON THE ARM* ARCHITECTURE; FEATURE LOW-POWER, LONG BATTERY-LIFE OPERATION; AND ARE BUILT IN SOC FORMATS THAT INTEGRATE NUMEROUS FUNCTIONS ON ONE CHIP.

IN THE DATA CENTER SEGMENT, OUR DATA CENTER PLATFORMS FACE EMERGING COMPETITION FROM COMPANIES USING ARM ARCHITECTURE OR OTHER TECHNOLOGIES. INTERNET CLOUD COMPUTING AND HIGH-PERFORMANCE COMPUTING ARE AREAS OF SIGNIFICANT TARGETED GROWTH FOR US IN THE DATA CENTER SEGMENT, AND WE FACE STRONG COMPETITION IN THESE MARKET SEGMENTS.

WE ARE A RELATIVELY NEW ENTRANT TO THE SEGMENTS FOR TABLETS, SMARTPHONES, AND SIMILAR ULTRA-MOBILE DEVICES. WE HAVE ADJUSTED OUR PRODUCT ROADMAPS TO EMPHASIZE THE DEVELOPMENT OF LOW-POWER SOC CHIPS FOR SUCH DEVICES, AS WELL THE INTERNET OF THINGS.

IN THE INTERNET OF THINGS MARKET SEGMENT, WE HAVE A LONG-STANDING POSITION AS A SUPPLIER OF COMPONENTS AND SOFTWARE FOR EMBEDDED PRODUCTS, AND THIS MARKETPLACE IS SIGNIFICANTLY EXPANDING WITH INCREASING TYPES AND NUMBERS OF SMART AND CONNECTED DEVICES FOR INDUSTRIAL, COMMERCIAL, AND CONSUMER USES. IN THIS GROWING MARKET SEGMENT, WE FACE NUMEROUS LARGE AND SMALL INCUMBENT COMPETITORS AS WELL AS NEW ENTRANTS THAT USE ARM ARCHITECTURE AND OTHER OPERATING SYSTEMS AND SOFTWARE.

MCAFEE IS A MAJOR PROVIDER OF DIGITAL SECURITY PRODUCTS AND SERVICES TO BUSINESSES AND CONSUMERS. NUMEROUS COMPETITORS OFFER SECURITY PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, AND WE SEEK TO OFFER COMPETITIVE DIFFERENTIATION BY INTEGRATING HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE SECURITY FEATURES IN MANY OF OUR OFFERINGS AND TO HAVE SECURITY OFFERINGS IN NUMEROUS MARKET SEGMENTS, INCLUDING MOBILE AND EMBEDDED DEVICES AND FOR DATA CENTERS.

OUR PRODUCTS PRIMARILY COMPETE BASED ON PERFORMANCE, ENERGY EFFICIENCY, INTEGRATION, INNOVATIVE DESIGN, FEATURES, PRICE, QUALITY, RELIABILITY, BRAND RECOGNITION, AND AVAILABILITY. THE IMPORTANCE OF THESE FACTORS WILL VARY BY THE TYPE OF END SYSTEM FOR THE PRODUCTS. FOR EXAMPLE, PERFORMANCE MIGHT BE AMONG THE MOST IMPORTANT FACTORS FOR OUR PRODUCTS FOR DATA CENTER SERVERS, WHILE PRICE AND INTEGRATION MIGHT BE AMONG THE MOST IMPORTANT FACTORS FOR OUR PRODUCTS FOR TABLETS

,

SMARTPHONES, AND OTHER MOBILE DEVICES.

COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGES

OUR PRODUCTS' ABILITY TO OPERATE ON MULTIPLE OPERATING SYSTEMS IN END-USER PRODUCTS AND PLATFORMS OPERATED OR SOLD BY THIRD PARTIES, INCLUDING OEMS, IS A KEY COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE. WE SEEK TO OPTIMIZE OUR PRODUCTS FOR MULTIPLE OPERATING SYSTEMS AND INVEST SUBSTANTIAL RESOURCES WORKING WITH THIRD PARTIES TO DO SO, BUT SUCH INVESTMENTS ARE RISKY GIVEN THAT IT IS NOT CLEAR WHICH PRODUCTS WILL SUCCEED IN THE MARKET.

ANOTHER KEY COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE IS OUR MARKET LEAD IN TRANSITIONING TO THE NEXT-GENERATION PROCESS TECHNOLOGY AND BRINGING PRODUCTS TO MARKET USING SUCH TECHNOLOGY. WE HAVE PRODUCTS IN THE MARKET MANUFACTURED USING OUR 14NM PROCESS TECHNOLOGY AND ARE CURRENTLY WORKING ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF OUR NEXT-GENERATION 10NM PROCESS TECHNOLOGY. WE BELIEVE THAT THESE TRANSITIONS WILL OFFER SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS IN ONE OR MORE OF THE FOLLOWING AREAS: PERFORMANCE, NEW FEATURES, ENERGY EFFICIENCY, AND COST.

MOREOVER, THE COMBINATION OF OUR NETWORK OF MANUFACTURING AND ASSEMBLY AND TEST FACILITIES WITH OUR GLOBAL ARCHITECTURE DESIGN TEAMS IS ANOTHER IMPORTANT COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE. WE HAVE MADE SIGNIFICANT CAPITAL AND R&D INVESTMENTS INTO THIS INTEGRATED MANUFACTURING NETWORK, WHICH ENABLES US TO HAVE MORE DIRECT CONTROL OVER OUR PROCESSES, QUALITY CONTROL, PRODUCT COST, PRODUCTION TIMING, PERFORMANCE, POWER CONSUMPTION, AND MANUFACTURING YIELD. THE INCREASED COST OF CONSTRUCTING NEW FABRICATION FACILITIES SUPPORTING SMALLER TRANSISTOR GEOMETRIES AND LARGER WAFERS HAS LED TO A SMALLER POOL OF COMPANIES THAT CAN AFFORD TO BUILD AND EQUIP LEADING-EDGE MANUFACTURING FACILITIES. MOST OF OUR COMPETITORS RELY ON THIRD-PARTY FOUNDRIES AND SUBCONTRACTORS SUCH AS TAIWAN SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING COMPANY, LTD. AND GLOBALFOUNDRIES INC. FOR MANUFACTURING AND ASSEMBLY AND TEST NEEDS. WE PROVIDE FOUNDRY SERVICES AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO SUCH FOUNDRIES.

MANUFACTURING AND ASSEMBLY AND TEST

AS OF

DECEMBER 27, 2014

,

70%

OF OUR WAFER FABRICATION, INCLUDING MICROPROCESSORS AND CHIPSETS, WAS CONDUCTED WITHIN THE U.S. AT OUR FACILITIES IN ARIZONA, NEW MEXICO, OREGON, AND MASSACHUSETTS.

OUR MASSACHUSETTS FABRICATION FACILITY IS OUR LAST MANUFACTURING FACILITY ON

200 MILLIMETER (MM)

WAFERS AND IS EXPECTED TO CEASE PRODUCTION IN Q1 2015.

THE REMAINING

30%

OF OUR WAFER FABRICATION WAS CONDUCTED OUTSIDE THE U.S. AT OUR FACILITIES IN ISRAEL AND CHINA.

OUR FABRICATION FACILITY IN IRELAND IS CURRENTLY TRANSITIONING TO OUR 14NM PROCESS TECHNOLOGY, WITH MANUFACTURING EXPECTED TO RAMP IN THE SECOND HALF OF 2015.

WAFER FABRICATION CONDUCTED WITHIN AND OUTSIDE THE U.S. MAY BE IMPACTED BY THE TIMING OF A FACILITY’S TRANSITION TO A NEWER PROCESS TECHNOLOGY, AS WELL AS A FACILITY’S CAPACITY UTILIZATION.

, A SUBSTANTIAL MAJORITY OF OUR MICROPROCESSORS WERE MANUFACTURED ON 300MM WAFERS USING OUR 14NM, 22NM, AND 32NM PROCESS TECHNOLOGY. AS WE MOVE TO EACH SUCCEEDING GENERATION OF MANUFACTURING PROCESS TECHNOLOGY, WE INCUR SIGNIFICANT START-UP COSTS TO PREPARE EACH FACTORY FOR MANUFACTURING. HOWEVER, CONTINUING TO ADVANCE OUR PROCESS TECHNOLOGY PROVIDES BENEFITS THAT WE BELIEVE JUSTIFY THESE COSTS. THE BENEFITS OF MOVING TO EACH SUCCEEDING GENERATION OF MANUFACTURING PROCESS TECHNOLOGY CAN INCLUDE USING LESS SPACE PER TRANSISTOR, REDUCING HEAT OUTPUT FROM EACH TRANSISTOR, AND INCREASING THE NUMBER OF INTEGRATED FEATURES ON EACH CHIP. THESE ADVANCEMENTS CAN RESULT IN

NEW DEVICES WITH HIGHER FUNCTIONALITY AND COMPLEXITY WHILE CONTROLLING POWER, COST, AND SIZE.

IN ADDITION, WITH EACH SHIFT TO A NEW PROCESS TECHNOLOGY, WE ARE ABLE TO PRODUCE MORE MICROPROCESSORS PER SQUARE FOOT OF OUR WAFER FABRICATION FACILITIES. THE COSTS TO DEVELOP OUR PROCESS TECHNOLOGY ARE SIGNIFICANTLY LESS THAN ADDING CAPACITY BY BUILDING ADDITIONAL WAFER FABRICATION FACILITIES USING OLDER PROCESS TECHNOLOGY.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

WE USE THIRD-PARTY FOUNDRIES TO MANUFACTURE WAFERS FOR CERTAIN COMPONENTS, INCLUDING COMMUNICATION AND CONNECTIVITY PRODUCTS. IN 2014, WE QUALIFIED OUR FIRST SOC APPLICATION PROCESSOR AND BASEBAND 3G SOLUTION, CODE-NAMED "SOFIA," WHICH WILL BE FABRICATED BY A THIRD-PARTY FOUNDRY. IN ADDITION, WE PRIMARILY USE SUBCONTRACTORS TO MANUFACTURE BOARD-LEVEL PRODUCTS AND SYSTEMS. WE PURCHASE CERTAIN COMMUNICATION AND CONNECTIVITY PRODUCTS FROM EXTERNAL VENDORS PRIMARILY IN THE ASIA-PACIFIC REGION.

FOLLOWING THE MANUFACTURING PROCESS, THE MAJORITY OF OUR COMPONENTS ARE SUBJECT TO ASSEMBLY AND TEST. WE PERFORM OUR COMPONENTS ASSEMBLY AND TEST AT FACILITIES IN

MALAYSIA, CHINA, AND VIETNAM

. OUR ASSEMBLY AND TEST FACILITY IN COSTA RICA CEASED PRODUCTION IN Q4 2014. TO AUGMENT CAPACITY, WE USE SUBCONTRACTORS TO PERFORM ASSEMBLY AND TEST OF CERTAIN PRODUCTS, PRIMARILY CHIPSETS AND COMMUNICATION AND CONNECTIVITY PRODUCTS.

OUR NAND FLASH MEMORY PRODUCTS ARE MANUFACTURED BY IMFT AND MICRON USING 20NM OR 25NM PROCESS TECHNOLOGY, AND ASSEMBLY AND TEST OF THESE PRODUCTS IS PERFORMED BY MICRON AND OTHER EXTERNAL SUBCONTRACTORS. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION, SEE "

OUR EMPLOYMENT AND OPERATING PRACTICES ARE CONSISTENT WITH, AND WE EXPECT OUR SUPPLIERS AND SUBCONTRACTORS TO ABIDE BY, LOCAL COUNTRY LAW. INTEL EXPECTS ALL SUPPLIERS TO COMPLY WITH OUR CODE OF CONDUCT AND THE ELECTRONIC INDUSTRY CITIZENSHIP COALITION (EICC) CODE OF CONDUCT, BOTH OF WHICH SET STANDARDS THAT ADDRESS THE RIGHTS OF WORKERS TO SAFE AND HEALTHY WORKING CONDITIONS, ENVIRONMENTAL RESPONSIBILITY, COMPLIANCE WITH PRIVACY AND DATA SECURITY OBLIGATIONS, AND COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE LAWS.

WE HAVE THOUSANDS OF SUPPLIERS, INCLUDING SUBCONTRACTORS, PROVIDING OUR VARIOUS MATERIALS, EQUIPMENT, AND SERVICE NEEDS. WE SET EXPECTATIONS FOR SUPPLIER PERFORMANCE AND REINFORCE THOSE EXPECTATIONS WITH PERIODIC ASSESSMENTS AND AUDITS. WE COMMUNICATE THOSE EXPECTATIONS TO OUR SUPPLIERS REGULARLY AND WORK WITH THEM TO IMPLEMENT IMPROVEMENTS WHEN NECESSARY. WHERE POSSIBLE, WE SEEK TO HAVE SEVERAL SOURCES OF SUPPLY FOR ALL OF THESE MATERIALS AND RESOURCES, BUT WE MAY RELY ON A SINGLE OR LIMITED NUMBER OF SUPPLIERS, OR UPON SUPPLIERS IN A SINGLE COUNTRY. IN THOSE CASES, WE DEVELOP AND IMPLEMENT PLANS AND ACTIONS TO REDUCE THE EXPOSURE THAT WOULD RESULT FROM A DISRUPTION IN SUPPLY. WE HAVE ENTERED INTO LONG-TERM CONTRACTS WITH CERTAIN SUPPLIERS TO HELP ENSURE A STABLE SUPPLY OF SILICON AND SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING TOOLS.

OUR PRODUCTS ARE TYPICALLY MANUFACTURED AT MULTIPLE INTEL FACILITIES AROUND THE WORLD OR BY SUBCONTRACTORS. HOWEVER, SOME PRODUCTS ARE MANUFACTURED IN ONLY ONE INTEL OR SUBCONTRACTOR FACILITY, AND WE SEEK TO IMPLEMENT ACTION PLANS TO REDUCE THE EXPOSURE THAT WOULD RESULT FROM A DISRUPTION AT ANY SUCH FACILITY. SEE "RISK FACTORS" IN PART I, ITEM 1A OF THIS FORM 10-K.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

WE ARE COMMITTED TO INVESTING IN WORLD-CLASS TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT, PARTICULARLY IN THE DESIGN AND MANUFACTURE OF INTEGRATED CIRCUITS. R&D EXPENDITURES WERE

$11.5 BILLION

IN

2014

(

$10.6 BILLION

IN

2013

AND

$10.1 BILLION

IN

2012

).

OUR R&D ACTIVITIES ARE DIRECTED TOWARD THE DELIVERY OF SOLUTIONS CONSISTING OF HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE PLATFORMS AND SUPPORTING SERVICES ACROSS A WIDE RANGE OF COMPUTING DEVICES. WE ARE FOCUSED ON DEVELOPING THE TECHNOLOGY INNOVATIONS THAT WE BELIEVE WILL DELIVER OUR NEXT GENERATION OF PRODUCTS, WHICH WILL IN TURN ENABLE NEW FORM FACTORS AND USAGE MODELS FOR BUSINESSES AND CONSUMERS. WE FOCUS OUR R&D EFFORTS ON ADVANCED COMPUTING TECHNOLOGIES, DEVELOPING NEW MICROARCHITECTURES, ADVANCING OUR SILICON MANUFACTURING PROCESS TECHNOLOGY, DELIVERING THE NEXT GENERATION OF PLATFORMS, IMPROVING OUR PLATFORM INITIATIVES, DEVELOPING NEW SOLUTIONS IN EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES INCLUDING MEMORY AND THE INTERNET OF THINGS, AS WELL AS DEVELOPING SOFTWARE SOLUTIONS AND TOOLS. OUR R&D EFFORTS ARE INTENDED TO ENABLE NEW LEVELS OF PERFORMANCE AND ADDRESS AREAS SUCH AS ENERGY EFFICIENCY, SYSTEM-LEVEL INTEGRATION, SECURITY, SCALABILITY FOR MULTI-CORE ARCHITECTURES, SYSTEM MANAGEABILITY, AND EASE OF USE.

AS PART OF OUR R&D EFFORTS, WE PLAN TO INTRODUCE A NEW INTEL CORE MICROARCHITECTURE FOR DESKTOPS, NOTEBOOKS (INCLUDING ULTRABOOK DEVICES AND 2 IN 1 SYSTEMS), AND INTEL XEON PROCESSORS

APPROXIMATELY EVERY TWO TO THREE YEARS AND RAMPING THE NEXT GENERATION OF SILICON PROCESS TECHNOLOGY IN THE INTERVENING PERIODS

. WE REFER TO THIS AS OUR "TICK-TOCK" TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT CADENCE, AS ILLUSTRATED BELOW.

ADVANCES IN OUR SILICON TECHNOLOGY HAVE ENABLED US TO CONTINUE MAKING MOORE’S LAW A REALITY. IN 2014, WE BEGAN MANUFACTURING OUR 5TH GENERATION INTEL CORE PROCESSOR FAMILY USING OUR 14NM PROCESS TECHNOLOGY. WE ARE CURRENTLY DEVELOPING OUR NEXT-GENERATION INTEL

®

MICROARCHITECTURE, CODE-NAMED "SKYLAKE," USING OUR 14NM PROCESS TECHNOLOGY, WHICH WE EXPECT TO RELEASE IN THE SECOND HALF OF 2015. WE ARE ALSO DEVELOPING 10NM MANUFACTURING PROCESS TECHNOLOGY, OUR NEXT-GENERATION PROCESS TECHNOLOGY.

WE HAVE CONTINUED EXPANDING ON THE ADVANCES ANTICIPATED BY MOORE’S LAW BY BRINGING NEW CAPABILITIES INTO SILICON AND PRODUCING NEW PRODUCTS OPTIMIZED FOR A WIDER VARIETY OF APPLICATIONS. WE HAVE ACCELERATED THE INTEL ATOM PROCESSOR-BASED SOC ROADMAP FOR ULTRA-MOBILE FORM FACTORS, INCLUDING TABLETS AND SMARTPHONES, AS WELL AS NOTEBOOKS (INCLUDING ULTRABOOK DEVICES AND 2 IN 1 SYSTEMS), THE INTERNET OF THINGS, AND DATA CENTER APPLICATIONS, FROM 32NM THROUGH 22NM TO 14NM. OUR INTEL ATOM PROCESSORS FOR ULTRA-MOBILE FORM FACTORS AND THE INTERNET OF THINGS ARE TRANSITIONING TO THE SAME PROCESS TECHNOLOGY AS OUR LEADING-EDGE PRODUCTS. WE EXPECT THAT THIS ACCELERATION WILL RESULT IN A SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN TRANSISTOR LEAKAGE, LOWER ACTIVE POWER, AND AN INCREASE IN TRANSISTOR DENSITY TO ENABLE MORE POWERFUL, FEATURE-RICH SMARTPHONES AND TABLETS WITH A LONGER BATTERY LIFE. THE INTEL

QUARK SOC IS AN ULTRA-LOW-POWER AND LOW-COST ARCHITECTURE DESIGNED FOR THE INTERNET OF THINGS, FROM INDUSTRIAL MACHINES TO WEARABLE DEVICES.

WITH OUR CONTINUED FOCUS ON SILICON AND MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY LEADERSHIP, WE ENTERED INTO A SERIES OF AGREEMENTS WITH ASML HOLDING N.V. (ASML) IN 2012, CERTAIN OF WHICH WERE AMENDED IN 2014 TO FURTHER DEFINE THE COMMERCIAL TERMS BETWEEN THE PARTIES. THESE AMENDED AGREEMENTS, IN WHICH INTEL AGREED TO PROVIDE R&D FUNDING OVER FIVE YEARS, ARE INTENDED TO ACCELERATE THE DEVELOPMENT OF EXTREME ULTRAVIOLET (EUV) LITHOGRAPHY PROJECTS AND DEEP ULTRAVIOLET IMMERSION LITHOGRAPHY PROJECTS, INCLUDING GENERIC DEVELOPMENTS APPLICABLE TO BOTH 300MM AND 450MM.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

OUR R&D ACTIVITIES RANGE FROM DESIGNING AND DEVELOPING NEW PRODUCTS AND MANUFACTURING PROCESSES TO RESEARCHING FUTURE TECHNOLOGIES AND PRODUCTS. WE CONTINUE TO MAKE SIGNIFICANT R&D INVESTMENTS IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF SOCS TO ENABLE GROWTH IN ULTRA-MOBILE FORM FACTORS. IN ADDITION, WE CONTINUE TO MAKE SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS IN COMMUNICATIONS AND CONNECTIVITY FOR TABLETS, SMARTPHONES, AND OTHER CONNECTED DEVICES, INCLUDING MUTLIMODE LTE MODEMS. OUR INVESTMENT IN CLOUDERA, COMPLETED IN 2014, IS EVIDENCE OF OUR DRIVE TO BRING BIG DATA ANALYTICS TO THE MAINSTREAM MARKET THROUGH THE JOINING OF CLOUDERA'S SOFTWARE PLATFORM AND OUR DATA CENTER ARCHITECTURE BASED ON INTEL XEON PROCESSORS. WE ALSO CONTINUE TO INVEST IN LEADING-EDGE FOUNDRY PLATFORMS AND ECOSYSTEM PARTNER DEVELOPMENT, GRAPHICS, HIGH-PERFORMANCE COMPUTING, AND COMMUNICATION AND CONNECTIVITY.

OUR R&D MODEL IS BASED ON A GLOBAL ORGANIZATION THAT EMPHASIZES A COLLABORATIVE APPROACH TO IDENTIFYING AND DEVELOPING NEW TECHNOLOGIES, LEADING STANDARDS INITIATIVES, AND INFLUENCING REGULATORY POLICIES TO ACCELERATE THE ADOPTION OF NEW TECHNOLOGIES, INCLUDING JOINT PATHFINDING CONDUCTED BETWEEN RESEARCHERS AT INTEL LABS AND OUR BUSINESS GROUPS. WE CENTRALLY MANAGE KEY CROSS-BUSINESS GROUP PRODUCT INITIATIVES TO ALIGN AND PRIORITIZE OUR R&D ACTIVITIES ACROSS THESE GROUPS. IN ADDITION, WE MAY AUGMENT OUR R&D ACTIVITIES BY INVESTING IN COMPANIES OR ENTERING INTO AGREEMENTS WITH COMPANIES THAT HAVE SIMILAR R&D FOCUS AREAS, AS WELL AS DIRECTLY PURCHASING OR LICENSING TECHNOLOGY APPLICABLE TO OUR R&D INITIATIVES.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

OUR PRODUCTS ARE TYPICALLY SHIPPED UNDER TERMS THAT TRANSFER TITLE TO THE CUSTOMER, EVEN IN ARRANGEMENTS FOR WHICH THE RECOGNITION OF REVENUE AND RELATED COST OF SALES IS DEFERRED. OUR STANDARD TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF SALE TYPICALLY PROVIDE THAT PAYMENT IS DUE AT A LATER DATE, GENERALLY 30 DAYS AFTER SHIPMENT OR DELIVERY.

WE ASSESS CREDIT RISK THROUGH QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE ANALYSIS. FROM THIS ANALYSIS, WE ESTABLISH SHIPPING AND CREDIT LIMITS, AND DETERMINE WHETHER WE WILL SEEK TO USE ONE OR MORE CREDIT SUPPORT DEVICES, SUCH AS OBTAINING A PARENT GUARANTEE, STANDBY LETTER OF CREDIT, OR CREDIT INSURANCE.

CREDIT LOSSES MAY STILL BE INCURRED DUE TO BANKRUPTCY, FRAUD, OR OTHER FAILURE OF THE CUSTOMER TO PAY. FOR INFORMATION ABOUT OUR ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL RECEIVABLES, SEE "SCHEDULE II—VALUATION AND QUALIFYING ACCOUNTS" IN PART IV OF THIS FORM 10-K.

OUR SALES TO DISTRIBUTORS ARE TYPICALLY MADE UNDER AGREEMENTS ALLOWING FOR PRICE PROTECTION ON UNSOLD MERCHANDISE AND A RIGHT OF RETURN ON STIPULATED QUANTITIES OF UNSOLD MERCHANDISE. UNDER THE PRICE PROTECTION PROGRAM, WE GIVE DISTRIBUTORS CREDITS FOR THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE ORIGINAL PRICE PAID AND THE CURRENT PRICE THAT WE OFFER. OUR PRODUCTS TYPICALLY HAVE NO CONTRACTUAL LIMIT ON THE AMOUNT OF PRICE PROTECTION, NOR IS THERE A LIMIT ON THE TIME HORIZON UNDER WHICH PRICE PROTECTION IS GRANTED. THE RIGHT OF RETURN GRANTED GENERALLY CONSISTS OF A STOCK ROTATION PROGRAM IN WHICH DISTRIBUTORS ARE ABLE TO EXCHANGE CERTAIN PRODUCTS BASED ON THE NUMBER OF QUALIFIED PURCHASES MADE BY THE DISTRIBUTOR. WE HAVE THE OPTION TO GRANT CREDIT FOR, REPAIR, OR REPLACE DEFECTIVE PRODUCTS, AND THERE IS NO CONTRACTUAL LIMIT ON THE AMOUNT OF CREDIT THAT MAY BE GRANTED TO A DISTRIBUTOR FOR DEFECTIVE PRODUCTS.

DISTRIBUTION

DISTRIBUTORS TYPICALLY HANDLE A WIDE VARIETY OF PRODUCTS, INCLUDING THOSE THAT COMPETE WITH OUR PRODUCTS, AND FILL ORDERS FOR MANY CUSTOMERS. CUSTOMERS MAY PLACE ORDERS DIRECTLY WITH US OR THROUGH DISTRIBUTORS. WE HAVE SEVERAL DISTRIBUTION WAREHOUSES THAT ARE LOCATED IN PROXIMITY TO KEY CUSTOMERS.

BACKLOG

OVER TIME, OUR LARGER CUSTOMERS HAVE GENERALLY MOVED TO LEAN-INVENTORY OR JUST-IN-TIME OPERATIONS RATHER THAN MAINTAINING LARGER INVENTORIES OF OUR PRODUCTS. AS OUR CUSTOMERS CONTINUE TO LOWER THEIR INVENTORIES, OUR PROCESSES TO FULFILL THEIR ORDERS HAVE EVOLVED TO MEET THEIR NEEDS. AS A RESULT, OUR MANUFACTURING PRODUCTION IS BASED ON ESTIMATES AND ADVANCE NON-BINDING COMMITMENTS FROM CUSTOMERS AS TO FUTURE PURCHASES. OUR ORDER BACKLOG AS OF ANY PARTICULAR DATE IS A MIX OF THESE COMMITMENTS AND SPECIFIC FIRM ORDERS THAT ARE PRIMARILY MADE PURSUANT TO STANDARD PURCHASE ORDERS FOR DELIVERY OF PRODUCTS. ONLY A SMALL PORTION OF OUR ORDERS ARE NON-CANCELABLE, AND THE DOLLAR AMOUNT ASSOCIATED WITH THE NON-CANCELABLE PORTION IS NOT SIGNIFICANT.

SEASONAL TRENDS

HISTORICALLY, OUR NET REVENUE HAS TYPICALLY BEEN HIGHER IN THE SECOND HALF OF THE YEAR THAN IN THE FIRST HALF OF THE YEAR, ACCELERATING IN THE THIRD QUARTER AND PEAKING IN THE FOURTH QUARTER.

THROUGH THE INTEL INSIDE PROGRAM, CERTAIN CUSTOMERS ARE LICENSED TO PLACE INTEL LOGOS ON COMPUTING DEVICES CONTAINING OUR MICROPROCESSORS AND PROCESSOR TECHNOLOGIES, AND TO USE OUR BRANDS IN THEIR MARKETING ACTIVITIES. THE PROGRAM INCLUDES A MARKET DEVELOPMENT COMPONENT THAT ACCRUES FUNDS BASED ON PURCHASES AND PARTIALLY REIMBURSES CUSTOMERS FOR MARKETING ACTIVITIES FOR PRODUCTS FEATURING INTEL BRANDS, SUBJECT TO CUSTOMERS MEETING DEFINED CRITERIA. THESE MARKETING ACTIVITIES PRIMARILY INCLUDE ADVERTISING THROUGH DIGITAL AND SOCIAL MEDIA AND TELEVISION, AS WELL AS PRESS RELATIONS. WE HAVE ALSO ENTERED INTO JOINT MARKETING ARRANGEMENTS WITH CERTAIN CUSTOMERS.

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS AND LICENSING

INTEL OWNS SIGNIFICANT INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY (IP) AND RELATED IP RIGHTS AROUND THE WORLD THAT RELATE TO OUR PRODUCTS, SERVICES, R&D, AND OTHER ACTIVITIES AND ASSETS. OUR IP PORTFOLIO INCLUDES PATENTS, COPYRIGHTS, TRADE SECRETS, TRADEMARKS, TRADE DRESS RIGHTS, AND MASKWORK RIGHTS. WE ACTIVELY SEEK TO PROTECT OUR GLOBAL IP RIGHTS AND TO DETER UNAUTHORIZED USE OF OUR IP AND OTHER ASSETS. SUCH EFFORTS CAN BE DIFFICULT, HOWEVER, PARTICULARLY IN COUNTRIES THAT PROVIDE LESS PROTECTION TO IP RIGHTS AND IN THE ABSENCE OF HARMONIZED INTERNATIONAL IP STANDARDS. WHILE OUR IP RIGHTS ARE IMPORTANT TO OUR SUCCESS, OUR BUSINESS AS A WHOLE IS NOT SIGNIFICANTLY DEPENDENT ON ANY SINGLE PATENT, COPYRIGHT, OR OTHER IP RIGHT. SEE "RISK FACTORS" IN PART I, ITEM 1A, AND "

NOTE 25: CONTINGENCIES

" IN PART II, ITEM 8 OF THIS FORM 10-K.

WE HAVE OBTAINED PATENTS IN THE U.S. AND OTHER COUNTRIES. BECAUSE OF THE FAST PACE OF INNOVATION AND PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT, AND THE COMPARATIVE PACE OF GOVERNMENTS’ PATENTING PROCESSES, OUR PRODUCTS ARE OFTEN OBSOLETE BEFORE THE PATENTS RELATED TO THEM EXPIRE; IN SOME CASES, OUR PRODUCTS MAY BE OBSOLETE BEFORE THE PATENTS RELATED TO THEM ARE GRANTED. AS WE EXPAND OUR PRODUCTS INTO NEW INDUSTRIES, WE ALSO SEEK TO EXTEND OUR PATENT DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS TO PATENT SUCH PRODUCTS. IN ADDITION TO DEVELOPING PATENTS BASED ON OUR OWN R&D EFFORTS, WE PURCHASE PATENTS FROM THIRD PARTIES TO SUPPLEMENT OUR PATENT PORTFOLIO. ESTABLISHED COMPETITORS IN EXISTING AND NEW INDUSTRIES, AS WELL AS COMPANIES THAT PURCHASE AND ENFORCE PATENTS AND OTHER IP, MAY ALREADY HAVE PATENTS COVERING SIMILAR PRODUCTS. THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO OBTAIN PATENTS COVERING OUR OWN PRODUCTS, OR THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO OBTAIN LICENSES FROM OTHER COMPANIES ON FAVORABLE TERMS OR AT ALL.

THE SOFTWARE THAT WE DISTRIBUTE, INCLUDING SOFTWARE EMBEDDED IN OUR COMPONENT-LEVEL AND PLATFORM PRODUCTS, IS ENTITLED TO COPYRIGHT AND OTHER IP PROTECTION. TO DISTINGUISH OUR PRODUCTS FROM OUR COMPETITORS’ PRODUCTS, WE HAVE OBTAINED TRADEMARKS AND TRADE NAMES FOR OUR PRODUCTS, AND WE MAINTAIN COOPERATIVE ADVERTISING PROGRAMS WITH CUSTOMERS TO PROMOTE OUR BRANDS AND TO IDENTIFY PRODUCTS CONTAINING GENUINE INTEL COMPONENTS. WE ALSO PROTECT DETAILS ABOUT OUR PROCESSES, PRODUCTS, AND STRATEGIES AS TRADE SECRETS, KEEPING CONFIDENTIAL THE INFORMATION THAT WE BELIEVE PROVIDES US WITH A COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE.

COMPLIANCE WITH ENVIRONMENTAL, HEALTH, AND SAFETY REGULATIONS

OUR COMPLIANCE EFFORTS FOCUS ON MONITORING REGULATORY AND RESOURCE TRENDS AND SETTING COMPANY-WIDE PERFORMANCE TARGETS FOR KEY RESOURCES AND EMISSIONS. THESE TARGETS ADDRESS SEVERAL PARAMETERS, INCLUDING PRODUCT DESIGN; CHEMICAL, ENERGY, AND WATER USE; WASTE RECYCLING; THE SOURCE OF CERTAIN MINERALS USED IN OUR PRODUCTS; CLIMATE CHANGE; AND EMISSIONS.

AS A COMPANY, WE FOCUS ON REDUCING NATURAL RESOURCE USE, THE SOLID AND CHEMICAL WASTE BY-PRODUCTS OF OUR MANUFACTURING PROCESSES, AND THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT OF OUR PRODUCTS. WE CURRENTLY USE A VARIETY OF MATERIALS IN OUR MANUFACTURING PROCESS THAT HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO ADVERSELY IMPACT THE ENVIRONMENT AND ARE SUBJECT TO A VARIETY OF ENVIRONMENTAL, HEALTH, AND SAFETY (EHS) LAWS AND REGULATIONS. OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS, WE HAVE SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED THE USE OF LEAD AND HALOGENATED FLAME RETARDANTS IN OUR PRODUCTS AND MANUFACTURING PROCESSES.

WE WORK WITH THE U.S. ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY (EPA), NON-GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS (NGOS), OEMS, AND RETAILERS TO HELP MANAGE E-WASTE (INCLUDING ELECTRONIC PRODUCTS NEARING THE END OF THEIR USEFUL LIVES) AND TO PROMOTE RECYCLING. THE EUROPEAN UNION REQUIRES PRODUCERS OF CERTAIN ELECTRICAL AND ELECTRONIC EQUIPMENT TO DEVELOP PROGRAMS THAT LET CONSUMERS RETURN PRODUCTS FOR RECYCLING. MANY U.S. STATES AND COUNTRIES IN LATIN AMERICA AND ASIA ALSO HAVE OR ARE DEVELOPING SIMILAR E-WASTE TAKE-BACK LAWS. ALTHOUGH THESE LAWS ARE TYPICALLY TARGETED AT THE END ELECTRONIC PRODUCT AND NOT THE COMPONENT PRODUCTS THAT WE MANUFACTURE, THE INCONSISTENCY OF MANY E-WASTE TAKE-BACK LAWS AND THE LACK OF LOCAL E-WASTE MANAGEMENT OPTIONS IN MANY AREAS POSE A CHALLENGE FOR OUR COMPLIANCE EFFORTS.

WE ARE AN INDUSTRY LEADER IN OUR EFFORTS TO BUILD ETHICAL SOURCING OF MINERALS FOR OUR PRODUCTS, INCLUDING "CONFLICT MINERALS" FROM THE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF THE CONGO (DRC) AND ADJOINING COUNTRIES. IN 2013, WE ACCOMPLISHED OUR GOAL TO MANUFACTURE MICROPROCESSORS THAT ARE DRC CONFLICT-FREE FOR TANTALUM, TIN, TUNGSTEN, AND GOLD. WE CONTINUE OUR WORK TO ESTABLISH DRC CONFLICT-FREE SUPPLY CHAINS FOR OUR COMPANY AND OUR INDUSTRY, AND HAVE SET A NEW GOAL THAT ALL PRODUCTS CURRENTLY ON OUR ROADMAP FOR 2016 AND BEYOND WILL BE DRC CONFLICT-FREE FOR THESE FOUR MINERALS.

WE SEEK TO REDUCE OUR GLOBAL GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS BY INVESTING IN ENERGY CONSERVATION PROJECTS IN OUR FACTORIES AND WORKING WITH SUPPLIERS TO IMPROVE ENERGY EFFICIENCY. WE TAKE A HOLISTIC APPROACH TO POWER MANAGEMENT, ADDRESSING THE CHALLENGE AT THE SILICON, PACKAGE, CIRCUIT, MICROARCHITECTURE, MACROARCHITECTURE, PLATFORM, AND SOFTWARE LEVELS. WE RECOGNIZE THAT CLIMATE CHANGE MAY CAUSE GENERAL ECONOMIC RISK. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ON THE RISKS OF CLIMATE CHANGE, SEE "RISK FACTORS" IN PART I, ITEM 1A OF THIS FORM 10-K. WE SEE A POTENTIAL FOR HIGHER ENERGY COSTS DRIVEN BY CLIMATE CHANGE REGULATIONS. THIS COULD INCLUDE ITEMS APPLIED TO UTILITY COMPANIES THAT ARE PASSED ALONG TO CUSTOMERS, SUCH AS CARBON TAXES OR COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH OBTAINING PERMITS FOR OUR MANUFACTURING OPERATIONS, EMISSION CAP AND TRADE PROGRAMS, OR RENEWABLE PORTFOLIO STANDARDS.

WE ARE COMMITTED TO SUSTAINABILITY AND TAKE A LEADERSHIP POSITION IN PROMOTING VOLUNTARY ENVIRONMENTAL INITIATIVES AND WORKING PROACTIVELY WITH GOVERNMENTS, ENVIRONMENTAL GROUPS, AND INDUSTRY TO PROMOTE GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY. WE BELIEVE THAT TECHNOLOGY WILL BE FUNDAMENTAL TO FINDING SOLUTIONS TO THE WORLD’S ENVIRONMENTAL CHALLENGES, AND WE ARE JOINING FORCES WITH INDUSTRY, BUSINESS, AND GOVERNMENTS TO FIND AND PROMOTE WAYS THAT TECHNOLOGY CAN BE USED AS A TOOL TO COMBAT CLIMATE CHANGE.

WE HAVE BEEN PURCHASING RENEWABLE ENERGY AT SOME OF OUR MAJOR SITES FOR SEVERAL YEARS. WE PURCHASE RENEWABLE ENERGY CERTIFICATES UNDER A MULTI-YEAR CONTRACT. THIS PURCHASE HAS PLACED INTEL AT THE TOP OF THE EPA’S GREEN POWER PARTNERSHIP FOR THE PAST SEVEN YEARS AND IS INTENDED TO HELP STIMULATE THE MARKET FOR GREEN POWER, LEADING TO ADDITIONAL GENERATING CAPACITY AND, ULTIMATELY, LOWER COSTS.

RISK FACTORS

THE FOLLOWING RISKS COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, AND THE TRADING PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK COULD DECLINE. THESE RISK FACTORS DO NOT IDENTIFY ALL RISKS THAT WE FACE; OUR OPERATIONS COULD ALSO BE AFFECTED BY FACTORS THAT ARE NOT PRESENTLY KNOWN TO US OR THAT WE CURRENTLY CONSIDER TO BE IMMATERIAL TO OUR OPERATIONS. DUE TO RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES, KNOWN AND UNKNOWN, OUR PAST FINANCIAL RESULTS MAY NOT BE A RELIABLE INDICATOR OF FUTURE PERFORMANCE, AND HISTORICAL TRENDS SHOULD NOT BE USED TO ANTICIPATE RESULTS OR TRENDS IN FUTURE PERIODS. YOU SHOULD ALSO REFER TO THE OTHER INFORMATION SET FORTH IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT, INCLUDING "MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS" AND OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND THE RELATED NOTES.

CHANGES IN PRODUCT DEMAND CAN HARM OUR RESULTS OF OPERATION AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS IS VARIABLE AND HARD TO PREDICT.

CHANGES IN THE DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS MAY REDUCE OUR REVENUE, INCREASE OUR COSTS, LOWER OUR GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE, OR REQUIRE US TO WRITE DOWN THE VALUE OF OUR ASSETS. IMPORTANT FACTORS THAT COULD LEAD TO VARIATION IN THE DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS INCLUDE CHANGES IN.

•

BUSINESS CONDITIONS, INCLUDING DOWNTURNS IN THE COMPUTING INDUSTRY, OR IN THE GLOBAL OR REGIONAL ECONOMIES;

•

CONSUMER CONFIDENCE OR INCOME LEVELS CAUSED BY CHANGES IN MARKET CONDITIONS, INCLUDING CHANGES IN GOVERNMENT BORROWING, TAXATION, OR SPENDING POLICIES; THE CREDIT MARKET; OR EXPECTED INFLATION, EMPLOYMENT, AND ENERGY OR OTHER COMMODITY PRICES;

•

THE LEVEL OF OUR CUSTOMERS’ INVENTORIES;

•

COMPETITIVE AND PRICING PRESSURES, INCLUDING ACTIONS TAKEN BY COMPETITORS;

•

CUSTOMER PRODUCT NEEDS;

•

MARKET ACCEPTANCE OF OUR PRODUCTS AND MATURING PRODUCT CYCLES; AND

•

THE TECHNOLOGY SUPPLY CHAIN, INCLUDING SUPPLY CONSTRAINTS CAUSED BY NATURAL DISASTERS OR OTHER EVENTS.

WE FACE SIGNIFICANT COMPETITION.

THE INDUSTRY IN WHICH WE OPERATE IS HIGHLY COMPETITIVE AND SUBJECT TO RAPID TECHNOLOGICAL AND MARKET DEVELOPMENTS, CHANGES IN INDUSTRY STANDARDS, CHANGES IN CUSTOMER NEEDS, AND FREQUENT PRODUCT INTRODUCTIONS AND IMPROVEMENTS. IF WE DO NOT ANTICIPATE AND RESPOND TO THESE DEVELOPMENTS, OUR COMPETITIVE POSITION MAY WEAKEN, AND OUR PRODUCTS OR TECHNOLOGIES MIGHT BE UNCOMPETITIVE OR OBSOLETE. OVER RECENT YEARS, OUR BUSINESS FOCUS HAS EXPANDED AND NOW INCLUDES THE DESIGN AND PRODUCTION OF PLATFORMS FOR TABLETS, SMARTPHONES, AND OTHER DEVICES ACROSS THE COMPUTE CONTINUUM, INCLUDING PRODUCTS FOR THE INTERNET OF THINGS, AND RELATED SERVICES. AS A RESULT, WE FACE NEW SOURCES OF COMPETITION, INCLUDING, IN CERTAIN OF THESE MARKET SEGMENTS, FROM INCUMBENT COMPETITORS WITH ESTABLISHED CUSTOMER BASES AND GREATER BRAND RECOGNITION. TO BE SUCCESSFUL, WE NEED TO CULTIVATE NEW INDUSTRY RELATIONSHIPS WITH CUSTOMERS AND PARTNERS IN THESE MARKET SEGMENTS. IN ADDITION, WE MUST CONTINUALLY IMPROVE THE COST, INTEGRATION, AND ENERGY EFFICIENCY OF OUR PRODUCTS AS WELL AS EXPAND OUR SOFTWARE CAPABILITIES TO PROVIDE CUSTOMERS WITH COMPREHENSIVE COMPUTING SOLUTIONS. DESPITE OUR ONGOING EFFORTS, THERE IS NO GUARANTEE THAT WE WILL ACHIEVE OR MAINTAIN CONSUMER AND MARKET ACCEPTANCE FOR OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES IN THESE VARIOUS MARKET SEGMENTS.

TO COMPETE SUCCESSFULLY, WE MUST MAINTAIN A SUCCESSFUL R&D EFFORT, DEVELOP NEW PRODUCTS AND PRODUCTION PROCESSES, AND IMPROVE OUR EXISTING PRODUCTS AND PROCESSES AHEAD OF COMPETITORS. FOR EXAMPLE, WE INVEST SUBSTANTIALLY IN OUR NETWORK OF MANUFACTURING AND ASSEMBLY AND TEST FACILITIES, INCLUDING THE CONSTRUCTION OF NEW FABRICATION FACILITIES TO SUPPORT SMALLER TRANSISTOR GEOMETRIES AND LARGER WAFERS. OUR R&D EFFORTS ARE CRITICAL TO OUR SUCCESS AND ARE AIMED AT SOLVING COMPLEX PROBLEMS, AND WE DO NOT EXPECT ALL OF OUR PROJECTS TO BE SUCCESSFUL. WE MAY BE UNABLE TO DEVELOP AND MARKET NEW PRODUCTS SUCCESSFULLY, AND THE PRODUCTS WE INVEST IN AND DEVELOP MAY NOT BE WELL-RECEIVED BY CUSTOMERS. OUR R&D INVESTMENTS MAY NOT GENERATE SIGNIFICANT OPERATING INCOME OR CONTRIBUTE TO OUR FUTURE OPERATING RESULTS FOR SEVERAL YEARS, AND SUCH CONTRIBUTIONS MAY NOT MEET OUR EXPECTATIONS OR EVEN COVER THE COSTS OF SUCH INVESTMENTS. ADDITIONALLY, THE PRODUCTS AND TECHNOLOGIES OFFERED BY OTHERS MAY AFFECT DEMAND FOR, OR PRICING OF, OUR PRODUCTS.

IF WE ARE NOT ABLE TO COMPETE EFFECTIVELY, OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS WILL BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED, INCLUDING INCREASED COSTS AND REDUCED REVENUE AND GROSS MARGIN, AND WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO ACCELERATE THE WRITE-DOWN OF THE VALUE OF CERTAIN ASSETS.

18

TABLE OF CONTENTS

CHANGES IN THE MIX OF PRODUCTS SOLD MAY HARM OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS.

PRICES DIFFER WIDELY AMONG THE PLATFORMS WE OFFER IN OUR VARIOUS MARKET SEGMENTS DUE TO DIFFERENCES IN FEATURES OFFERED OR MANUFACTURING COSTS. FOR EXAMPLE, PRODUCT OFFERINGS RANGE FROM LOWER-PRICED AND ENTRY-LEVEL PLATFORMS SUCH AS THOSE BASED ON INTEL QUARK OR INTEL ATOM PROCESSORS TO HIGHER-END PLATFORMS BASED ON INTEL XEON AND INTEL ITANIUM PROCESSORS. IF THERE IS A SHIFT IN DEMAND FROM OUR HIGHER-PRICED TO LOWER-PRICED PLATFORMS IN ANY OF OUR MARKET SEGMENTS, OUR GROSS MARGIN AND REVENUE WOULD DECREASE. IN ADDITION, WHEN PRODUCTS ARE INITIALLY INTRODUCED, THEY TEND TO HAVE HIGHER COSTS BECAUSE OF INITIAL DEVELOPMENT COSTS AND LOWER PRODUCTION VOLUMES RELATIVE TO THE PREVIOUS PRODUCT GENERATION, WHICH CAN IMPACT GROSS MARGIN.

WE OPERATE GLOBALLY AND ARE SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT RISKS IN MANY JURISDICTIONS.

GLOBAL OR REGIONAL CONDITIONS MAY HARM OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS.

WE HAVE MANUFACTURING, ASSEMBLY AND TEST, R&D, SALES, AND OTHER OPERATIONS IN MANY COUNTRIES, AND SOME OF OUR BUSINESS ACTIVITIES MAY BE CONCENTRATED IN ONE OR MORE GEOGRAPHIC AREAS. MOREOVER, SALES OUTSIDE THE U.S. ACCOUNTED FOR APPROXIMATELY

82%

OF OUR REVENUE FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 27, 2014. AS A RESULT, OUR OPERATIONS AND OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS, INCLUDING OUR ABILITY TO MANUFACTURE, ASSEMBLE AND TEST, DESIGN, DEVELOP, OR SELL PRODUCTS, MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY A NUMBER OF FACTORS OUTSIDE OF OUR CONTROL, INCLUDING.

•

GLOBAL AND LOCAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS;

•

GEOPOLITICAL AND SECURITY ISSUES, SUCH AS ARMED CONFLICT AND CIVIL OR MILITARY UNREST, CRIME, POLITICAL INSTABILITY, AND TERRORIST ACTIVITY;

•

NATURAL DISASTERS, PUBLIC HEALTH ISSUES, AND OTHER CATASTROPHIC EVENTS;

•

INEFFICIENT INFRASTRUCTURE AND OTHER DISRUPTIONS, SUCH AS SUPPLY CHAIN INTERRUPTIONS AND LARGE-SCALE OUTAGES OR UNRELIABLE PROVISION OF SERVICES FROM UTILITIES, TRANSPORTATION, DATA HOSTING, OR TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROVIDERS;

•

GOVERNMENT RESTRICTIONS ON, OR NATIONALIZATION OF OUR OPERATIONS IN ANY COUNTRY, OR RESTRICTIONS ON OUR ABILITY TO REPATRIATE EARNINGS FROM A PARTICULAR COUNTRY;

•

DIFFERING EMPLOYMENT PRACTICES AND LABOR ISSUES;

•

FORMAL OR INFORMAL IMPOSITION OF NEW OR REVISED EXPORT AND/OR IMPORT AND DOING-BUSINESS REGULATIONS, WHICH COULD BE CHANGED WITHOUT NOTICE;

•

INEFFECTIVE LEGAL PROTECTION OF OUR IP RIGHTS IN CERTAIN COUNTRIES; AND

•

LOCAL BUSINESS AND CULTURAL FACTORS THAT DIFFER FROM OUR NORMAL STANDARDS AND PRACTICES. WE ARE SUBJECT TO LAWS AND REGULATIONS WORLDWIDE AFFECTING OUR OPERATIONS IN AREAS INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, IP OWNERSHIP AND INFRINGEMENT, TAX, IMPORT AND EXPORT REQUIREMENTS, ANTI-CORRUPTION, FOREIGN EXCHANGE CONTROLS AND CASH REPATRIATION RESTRICTIONS, DATA PRIVACY REQUIREMENTS, ANTI-COMPETITION, EMPLOYMENT, ENVIRONMENT, HEALTH, AND SAFETY. COMPLIANCE WITH THESE LAWS AND REGULATIONS MAY BE ONEROUS AND EXPENSIVE AND SUCH REQUIREMENTS MAY DIFFER AMONG JURISDICTIONS.

ALTHOUGH WE HAVE POLICIES, CONTROLS, AND PROCEDURES DESIGNED TO ENSURE COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE LAWS, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT OUR EMPLOYEES, CONTRACTORS, SUPPLIERS, AND/OR AGENTS WILL NOT VIOLATE SUCH LAWS OR OUR POLICIES. VIOLATIONS OF THESE LAWS AND REGULATIONS COULD RESULT IN FINES; CRIMINAL SANCTIONS AGAINST US, OUR OFFICERS, OR OUR EMPLOYEES; PROHIBITIONS ON THE CONDUCT OF OUR BUSINESS; AND DAMAGE TO OUR REPUTATION.

WE MAY BE AFFECTED BY FLUCTUATIONS IN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES.

WE ARE POTENTIALLY EXPOSED TO ADVERSE AS WELL AS BENEFICIAL MOVEMENTS IN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES. ALTHOUGH MOST OF OUR SALES OCCUR IN U.S. DOLLARS, EXPENSES MAY BE PAID IN LOCAL CURRENCIES. AN INCREASE IN THE VALUE OF THE DOLLAR COULD INCREASE THE REAL COST TO OUR CUSTOMERS OF OUR PRODUCTS IN THOSE MARKETS OUTSIDE THE U.S. WHERE WE SELL IN DOLLARS, AND A WEAKENED DOLLAR COULD INCREASE THE COST OF EXPENSES SUCH AS PAYROLL, UTILITIES, TAX, AND MARKETING EXPENSES, AS WELL AS OVERSEAS CAPITAL EXPENDITURES. WE ALSO CONDUCT CERTAIN INVESTING AND FINANCING ACTIVITIES IN LOCAL CURRENCIES. OUR HEDGING PROGRAMS REDUCE, BUT DO NOT ELIMINATE, THE IMPACT OF CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE MOVEMENTS; THEREFORE, CHANGES IN EXCHANGE RATES COULD HARM OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

19

TABLE OF CONTENTS

CATASTROPHIC EVENTS OR GEOPOLITICAL CONDITIONS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL RESULTS.

OUR OPERATIONS OR SYSTEMS COULD BE DISRUPTED BY NATURAL DISASTERS; GEOPOLITICAL CONDITIONS; TERRORIST ACTIVITY; PUBLIC HEALTH ISSUES; CYBERSECURITY INCIDENTS; INTERRUPTIONS OF SERVICE FROM UTILITIES, TRANSPORTATION OR TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROVIDERS; OR OTHER CATASTROPHIC EVENTS. SUCH EVENTS COULD MAKE IT DIFFICULT OR IMPOSSIBLE TO MANUFACTURE OR DELIVER PRODUCTS TO OUR CUSTOMERS, RECEIVE PRODUCTION MATERIALS FROM OUR SUPPLIERS, OR PERFORM CRITICAL FUNCTIONS, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR REVENUE AND REQUIRE SIGNIFICANT RECOVERY TIME AND EXPENDITURES TO RESUME OPERATIONS. WHILE WE MAINTAIN BUSINESS RECOVERY PLANS THAT ARE INTENDED TO ALLOW US TO RECOVER FROM NATURAL DISASTERS OR OTHER EVENTS THAT CAN BE DISRUPTIVE TO OUR BUSINESS, SOME OF OUR SYSTEMS ARE NOT FULLY REDUNDANT AND WE CANNOT BE SURE THAT OUR PLANS WILL FULLY PROTECT US FROM ALL SUCH DISRUPTIONS.

WE MAINTAIN A PROGRAM OF INSURANCE COVERAGE FOR A VARIETY OF PROPERTY, CASUALTY, AND OTHER RISKS. WE PLACE OUR INSURANCE COVERAGE WITH MULTIPLE CARRIERS IN NUMEROUS JURISDICTIONS. HOWEVER, ONE OR MORE OF OUR INSURANCE PROVIDERS MAY BE UNABLE OR UNWILLING TO PAY A CLAIM. THE TYPES AND AMOUNTS OF INSURANCE WE OBTAIN VARY DEPENDING ON AVAILABILITY, COST, AND DECISIONS WITH RESPECT TO RISK RETENTION. THE POLICIES HAVE DEDUCTIBLES AND EXCLUSIONS THAT RESULT IN US RETAINING A LEVEL OF SELF-INSURANCE. LOSSES NOT COVERED BY INSURANCE MAY BE LARGE, WHICH COULD HARM OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

WE OPERATE OUR OWN FABRICATION FACILITIES AND, AS A RESULT, ARE VULNERABLE TO MANUFACTURING-RELATED RISKS.

DUE TO THE VARIABILITY IN DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS, WE MAY BE UNABLE TO TIMELY RESPOND TO REDUCE COSTS WHEN DEMAND DECLINES OR TO INCREASE PRODUCTION WHEN DEMAND INCREASES.

OUR OPERATIONS HAVE HIGH COSTS THAT ARE EITHER FIXED OR DIFFICULT TO REDUCE IN THE SHORT TERM, INCLUDING OUR COSTS RELATED TO MANUFACTURING, SUCH AS FACILITY CONSTRUCTION AND EQUIPMENT, R&D, AND THE EMPLOYMENT AND TRAINING OF A HIGHLY SKILLED WORKFORCE. IF PRODUCT DEMAND DECREASES OR WE FAIL TO FORECAST DEMAND ACCURATELY, WE COULD BE REQUIRED TO WRITE OFF INVENTORY OR RECORD EXCESS CAPACITY CHARGES, WHICH WOULD LOWER OUR GROSS MARGIN. OUR MANUFACTURING OR ASSEMBLY AND TEST CAPACITY COULD BE UNDERUTILIZED, AND WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO WRITE DOWN OUR LONG-LIVED ASSETS, WHICH WOULD INCREASE OUR EXPENSES. FACTORY-PLANNING DECISIONS MAY SHORTEN THE USEFUL LIVES OF FACILITIES AND EQUIPMENT AND CAUSE US TO ACCELERATE DEPRECIATION.

CONVERSELY, IF PRODUCT DEMAND INCREASES, WE MAY BE UNABLE TO ADD CAPACITY FAST ENOUGH TO MEET MARKET DEMAND. OUR REVENUE AND GROSS MARGIN CAN ALSO BE AFFECTED BY THE TIMING OF OUR PRODUCT INTRODUCTIONS AND RELATED EXPENSES, INCLUDING MARKETING EXPENSES.

WE ARE SUBJECT TO RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE DEVELOPMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION OF NEW MANUFACTURING PROCESS TECHNOLOGY.

WE MAY NOT BE SUCCESSFUL OR EFFICIENT IN DEVELOPING OR IMPLEMENTING NEW PRODUCTION PROCESSES. PRODUCTION OF INTEGRATED CIRCUITS IS A COMPLEX PROCESS. WE ARE CONTINUALLY ENGAGED IN THE TRANSITION FROM OUR EXISTING PROCESS TO THE NEXT-GENERATION PROCESS TECHNOLOGY. THIS CONSISTENT INNOVATION INVOLVES SIGNIFICANT EXPENSE AND CARRIES INHERENT RISKS, INCLUDING DIFFICULTIES IN DESIGNING AND DEVELOPING NEXT-GENERATION PROCESS TECHNOLOGIES, DEVELOPMENT AND PRODUCTION TIMING DELAYS, LOWER THAN ANTICIPATED MANUFACTURING YIELDS, AND PRODUCT DEFECTS AND ERRATA. DISRUPTIONS IN THE PRODUCTION PROCESS CAN ALSO RESULT FROM ERRORS, DEFECTS IN MATERIALS, INTERRUPTION IN OUR SUPPLY OF MATERIALS OR RESOURCES, AND DISRUPTIONS AT OUR FABRICATION AND ASSEMBLY AND TEST FACILITIES DUE TO ACCIDENTS, MAINTENANCE ISSUES, OR UNSAFE WORKING CONDITIONS—ALL OF WHICH COULD AFFECT THE TIMING OF PRODUCTION RAMPS AND YIELDS. PRODUCTION ISSUES CAN LEAD TO INCREASED COSTS AND MAY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO MEET PRODUCT DEMAND, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR BUSINESS AND THE RESULTS FROM OPERATIONS.

WE FACE SUPPLY CHAIN RISKS.

WE HAVE THOUSANDS OF SUPPLIERS PROVIDING MATERIALS THAT WE USE IN PRODUCTION AND OTHER ASPECTS OF OUR BUSINESS. WHERE POSSIBLE, WE SEEK TO HAVE SEVERAL SOURCES OF SUPPLY FOR ALL OF THOSE MATERIALS. HOWEVER, FOR CERTAIN MATERIALS, WE MAY RELY ON A SINGLE OR A LIMITED NUMBER OF SUPPLIERS, OR UPON SUPPLIERS IN A SINGLE LOCATION. IN ADDITION, CONSOLIDATION AMONG SUPPLIERS COULD IMPACT THE NATURE, QUALITY, AVAILABILITY, AND PRICING OF THE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES AVAILABLE TO US. THE INABILITY OF SUPPLIERS TO DELIVER ADEQUATE SUPPLIES OF PRODUCTION MATERIALS OR OTHER SUPPLIES COULD DISRUPT OUR PRODUCTION PROCESSES OR MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR US TO IMPLEMENT OUR BUSINESS STRATEGY. PRODUCTION COULD BE DISRUPTED BY THE UNAVAILABILITY OF RESOURCES USED IN PRODUCTION, SUCH AS WATER, SILICON, ELECTRICITY, GASES, AND OTHER MATERIALS. THE UNAVAILABILITY OR REDUCED AVAILABILITY OF MATERIALS OR RESOURCES MAY REQUIRE US TO REDUCE PRODUCTION OR INCUR ADDITIONAL COSTS, WHICH COULD HARM OUR BUSINESS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

20

TABLE OF CONTENTS

WE ALSO RELY ON THIRD-PARTY PROVIDERS TO MANUFACTURE, ASSEMBLE AND TEST CERTAIN COMPONENTS OR PRODUCTS, PARTICULARLY FOR OUR NETWORKING, MOBILE AND COMMUNICATIONS, AND NAND FLASH MEMORY BUSINESSES. IF ANY OF THESE THIRD PARTIES ARE UNABLE TO PERFORM THESE SERVICES ON A TIMELY BASIS, WE MAY ENCOUNTER SUPPLY DELAYS OR DISRUPTIONS THAT COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS.

IN ADDITION, THERE ARE REGULATORY AND OTHER REQUIREMENTS, RESTRICTIONS, AND REQUESTS FROM VARIOUS CONSTITUENCIES REGARDING SOURCING PRACTICES AND SUPPLIER CONDUCT, WITH A TREND TOWARD EXPANDING THE SCOPE OF MATERIALS AND LOCATIONS WHERE MATERIALS ORIGINATE, REGULATING SUPPLIER BEHAVIORS, AND INCREASING THE REQUIRED DISCLOSURES REGARDING SUCH MATTERS BY PUBLIC COMPANIES. INCREASED REGULATION AND PUBLIC PRESSURE IN THIS AREA WOULD CAUSE OUR COMPLIANCE COSTS TO INCREASE AND COULD NEGATIVELY AFFECT OUR REPUTATION GIVEN THAT WE USE MANY MATERIALS IN THE MANUFACTURING OF OUR PRODUCTS AND RELY ON MANY SUPPLIERS TO PROVIDE THESE MATERIALS, BUT DO NOT DIRECTLY CONTROL THEIR PROCUREMENT OR EMPLOYMENT PRACTICES.

WE ARE SUBJECT TO THE RISKS OF PRODUCT DEFECTS AND ERRATA.

PRODUCT DEFECTS AND ERRATA (DEVIATIONS FROM PUBLISHED SPECIFICATIONS) MAY RESULT FROM PROBLEMS IN OUR PRODUCT DESIGN OR OUR MANUFACTURING AND ASSEMBLY AND TEST PROCESSES. COSTS FROM DEFECTS AND ERRATA COULD INCLUDE.

•

WRITING OFF SOME OR ALL OF THE VALUE OF INVENTORY;

•

RECALLING PRODUCTS THAT HAVE BEEN SHIPPED;

•

PROVIDING PRODUCT REPLACEMENTS OR MODIFICATIONS; AND

•

DEFENDING AGAINST RESULTING LITIGATION.

THESE COSTS COULD BE LARGE AND MAY INCREASE EXPENSES AND LOWER GROSS MARGIN, AND RESULT IN DELAY OR LOSS OF REVENUE. OUR REPUTATION WITH CUSTOMERS OR END USERS COULD BE DAMAGED AS A RESULT OF PRODUCT DEFECTS AND ERRATA, AND PRODUCT DEMAND COULD BE REDUCED. THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF PRODUCT DEFECTS AND ERRATA COULD CAUSE CUSTOMERS TO PURCHASE PRODUCTS FROM COMPETITORS AS A RESULT OF POSSIBLE SHORTAGES OF OUR COMPONENTS OR FOR OTHER REASONS. ANY OF THESE OCCURRENCES COULD HARM OUR BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL RESULTS.

WE ARE SUBJECT TO RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS.

THE MANUFACTURING AND ASSEMBLY AND TEST OF OUR PRODUCTS REQUIRE THE USE OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS THAT ARE SUBJECT TO A BROAD ARRAY OF EHS LAWS AND REGULATIONS. OUR FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH THESE LAWS OR REGULATIONS COULD RESULT IN.

•

REGULATORY PENALTIES, FINES, AND LEGAL LIABILITIES;

•

SUSPENSION OF PRODUCTION;

•

ALTERATION OF OUR FABRICATION AND ASSEMBLY AND TEST PROCESSES;

•

REPUTATIONAL CHALLENGES; AND

•

RESTRICTIONS ON OUR OPERATIONS OR SALES.

OUR FAILURE TO MANAGE THE USE, TRANSPORTATION, EMISSIONS, DISCHARGE, STORAGE, RECYCLING, OR DISPOSAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS COULD LEAD TO INCREASED COSTS OR FUTURE LIABILITIES. OUR ABILITY TO GROW OR MODIFY OUR MANUFACTURING CAPABILITY IN THE FUTURE MAY BE IMPEDED BY ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS, SUCH AS AIR QUALITY AND WASTEWATER REQUIREMENTS. ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS COULD ALSO REQUIRE US TO ACQUIRE POLLUTION ABATEMENT OR REMEDIATION EQUIPMENT, MODIFY PRODUCT DESIGNS, OR INCUR OTHER EXPENSES. MANY NEW MATERIALS THAT WE ARE EVALUATING FOR USE IN OUR OPERATIONS MAY BE SUBJECT TO REGULATION UNDER ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS. THESE RESTRICTIONS COULD HARM OUR BUSINESS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS BY INCREASING OUR EXPENSES OR REQUIRING US TO ALTER MANUFACTURING AND ASSEMBLY AND TEST PROCESSES.

CLIMATE CHANGE MAY ALSO POSE REGULATORY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RISKS THAT COULD HARM OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND AFFECT THE WAY WE CONDUCT BUSINESS. FOR EXAMPLE, CLIMATE CHANGE REGULATION COULD RESULT IN INCREASED MANUFACTURING COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH AIR POLLUTION CONTROL REQUIREMENTS, AND INCREASED OR NEW MONITORING, RECORDKEEPING, AND REPORTING OF GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS. WE ALSO SEE THE POTENTIAL FOR HIGHER ENERGY COSTS DRIVEN BY CLIMATE CHANGE REGULATIONS IF, FOR EXAMPLE, UTILITY COMPANIES PASS ON THEIR COSTS TO THEIR CUSTOMERS. FURTHERMORE, MANY OF OUR OPERATIONS ARE LOCATED IN SEMI-ARID REGIONS THAT MAY BECOME INCREASINGLY VULNERABLE TO PROLONGED DROUGHTS DUE TO CLIMATE CHANGE. OUR FABRICATION FACILITIES HAVE SIGNIFICANT WATER USE AND, WHILE WE RECYCLE AND REUSE A PORTION OF THE WATER USED, WE MAY HAVE DIFFICULTIES OBTAINING SUFFICIENT WATER TO FULFILL OUR OPERATIONAL NEEDS DUE THE LACK OF AVAILABLE INFRASTRUCTURE.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

WE ARE SUBJECT TO IP RISKS AND RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH LITIGATION AND REGULATORY PROCEEDINGS.

WE MAY BE UNABLE TO ENFORCE OR PROTECT OUR IP RIGHTS.

WE REGARD OUR PATENTS, COPYRIGHTS, TRADE SECRETS, AND OTHER IP RIGHTS AS IMPORTANT TO THE SUCCESS OF OUR BUSINESS. WE RELY ON IP LAW AS WELL AS CONFIDENTIALITY AND LICENSING AGREEMENTS WITH OUR CUSTOMERS, EMPLOYEES, TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT PARTNERS, AND OTHERS TO PROTECT OUR IP RIGHTS. OUR ABILITY TO ENFORCE THESE RIGHTS IS SUBJECT TO GENERAL LITIGATION RISKS, AS WELL AS UNCERTAINTY AS TO THE ENFORCEABILITY OF OUR IP RIGHTS IN VARIOUS COUNTRIES. WHEN WE SEEK TO ENFORCE OUR RIGHTS, WE MAY BE SUBJECT TO CLAIMS THAT THE IP RIGHTS ARE INVALID, NOT ENFORCEABLE, OR LICENSED TO THE OPPOSING PARTY. OUR ASSERTION OF IP RIGHTS MAY RESULT IN THE OTHER PARTY SEEKING TO ASSERT CLAIMS AGAINST US, WHICH COULD HARM OUR BUSINESS. GOVERNMENTS MAY ADOPT REGULATIONS—AND GOVERNMENTS OR COURTS MAY RENDER DECISIONS—REQUIRING COMPULSORY LICENSING OF IP RIGHTS, OR GOVERNMENTS MAY REQUIRE PRODUCTS TO MEET STANDARDS THAT SERVE TO FAVOR LOCAL COMPANIES. OUR INABILITY TO ENFORCE OUR IP RIGHTS UNDER ANY OF THESE CIRCUMSTANCES MAY HARM OUR COMPETITIVE POSITION AND BUSINESS. IN ADDITION, THE THEFT OR UNAUTHORIZED USE OR PUBLICATION OF OUR TRADE SECRETS AND OTHER CONFIDENTIAL BUSINESS INFORMATION COULD HARM OUR COMPETITIVE POSITION AND REDUCE ACCEPTANCE OF OUR PRODUCTS; AS A RESULT, THE VALUE OF OUR INVESTMENT IN R&D, PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT, AND MARKETING COULD BE REDUCED.

OUR LICENSES WITH OTHER COMPANIES AND PARTICIPATION IN INDUSTRY INITIATIVES MAY ALLOW COMPETITORS TO USE OUR PATENT RIGHTS.

COMPANIES IN OUR INDUSTRY OFTEN BILATERALLY LICENSE PATENTS BETWEEN EACH OTHER TO SETTLE DISPUTES OR AS PART OF BUSINESS AGREEMENTS. OUR COMPETITORS MAY HAVE LICENSES TO OUR PATENTS, AND UNDER CURRENT CASE LAW, SOME OF THE LICENSES MAY EXHAUST OUR PATENT RIGHTS AS TO LICENSED PRODUCT SALES UNDER SOME CIRCUMSTANCES. OUR PARTICIPATION IN INDUSTRY STANDARDS ORGANIZATIONS OR WITH OTHER INDUSTRY INITIATIVES MAY REQUIRE US TO LICENSE OUR PATENTS TO COMPANIES THAT ADOPT INDUSTRY-STANDARD SPECIFICATIONS. DEPENDING ON THE RULES OF THE ORGANIZATION, WE MIGHT HAVE TO GRANT THESE LICENSES TO OUR PATENTS FOR LITTLE OR NO COST, AND AS A RESULT, WE MAY BE UNABLE TO ENFORCE CERTAIN PATENTS AGAINST OTHERS, OUR COSTS OF ENFORCING OUR LICENSES OR PROTECTING OUR PATENTS MAY INCREASE, AND THE VALUE OF OUR IP RIGHTS MAY BE IMPAIRED.

THIRD PARTIES MAY ASSERT CLAIMS BASED ON IP RIGHTS AGAINST US OR OUR PRODUCTS, WHICH COULD HARM OUR BUSINESS.

WE MAY FACE CLAIMS BASED ON IP RIGHTS FROM INDIVIDUALS AND COMPANIES, INCLUDING THOSE WHO HAVE ACQUIRED PATENT PORTFOLIOS TO ASSERT CLAIMS AGAINST OTHER COMPANIES. WE ARE NORMALLY ENGAGED IN A NUMBER OF LITIGATION MATTERS INVOLVING IP RIGHTS. CLAIMS THAT OUR PRODUCTS OR PROCESSES INFRINGE THE IP RIGHTS OF OTHERS, WHETHER OR NOT MERITORIOUS, COULD CAUSE US TO INCUR LARGE COSTS TO RESPOND TO, DEFEND, AND RESOLVE THE CLAIMS, AND THEY MAY DIVERT THE EFFORTS AND ATTENTION OF MANAGEMENT AND TECHNICAL PERSONNEL. IN ADDITION, WE MAY FACE CLAIMS BASED ON THE THEFT OR UNAUTHORIZED USE OR DISCLOSURE OF THIRD-PARTY TRADE SECRETS AND OTHER CONFIDENTIAL BUSINESS INFORMATION OR END-USER DATA THAT WE OBTAIN IN CONDUCTING OUR BUSINESS. ANY SUCH INCIDENTS AND CLAIMS COULD SEVERELY DISRUPT OUR BUSINESS, AND WE COULD SUFFER LOSSES, INCLUDING THE COST OF PRODUCT RECALLS AND RETURNS, AND REPUTATIONAL HARM. FURTHERMORE, WE HAVE AGREED TO INDEMNIFY CUSTOMERS FOR CERTAIN IP RIGHTS CLAIMS AGAINST THEM. AS A RESULT OF IP RIGHTS CLAIMS, WE COULD.

•

PAY MONETARY DAMAGES, INCLUDING PAYMENTS TO SATISFY INDEMNIFICATION OBLIGATIONS;

•

STOP MANUFACTURING, USING, SELLING, OFFERING TO SELL, OR IMPORTING PRODUCTS OR TECHNOLOGY SUBJECT TO CLAIMS;

•

DEVELOP OTHER PRODUCTS OR TECHNOLOGY NOT SUBJECT TO CLAIMS, WHICH COULD BE TIME-CONSUMING OR COSTLY; AND/OR

•

ENTER INTO SETTLEMENT AND LICENSE AGREEMENTS, WHICH AGREEMENTS MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE ON COMMERCIALLY REASONABLE TERMS.

THESE IP RIGHTS CLAIMS COULD HARM OUR COMPETITIVE POSITION, RESULT IN EXPENSES, OR REQUIRE US TO IMPAIR OUR ASSETS. IF WE ALTER OR STOP PRODUCTION OF AFFECTED ITEMS, OUR REVENUE COULD BE HARMED.

WE RELY ON ACCESS TO THIRD-PARTY IP, WHICH MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE TO US ON COMMERCIALLY REASONABLE TERMS OR AT ALL.

MANY OF OUR PRODUCTS INCLUDE THIRD-PARTY IP AND/OR IMPLEMENT INDUSTRY STANDARDS, WHICH MAY REQUIRE LICENSES FROM THIRD PARTIES. BASED ON PAST EXPERIENCE AND INDUSTRY PRACTICE, WE BELIEVE SUCH LICENSES GENERALLY CAN BE OBTAINED ON COMMERCIALLY REASONABLE TERMS. HOWEVER, THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT THE NECESSARY LICENSES CAN BE OBTAINED ON ACCEPTABLE TERMS OR AT ALL. FAILURE TO OBTAIN THE RIGHT TO USE THIRD-PARTY IP, OR TO USE SUCH IP ON COMMERCIALLY REASONABLE TERMS, COULD PRECLUDE US FROM SELLING CERTAIN PRODUCTS OR OTHERWISE HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

WE ARE SUBJECT TO THE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH LITIGATION AND REGULATORY PROCEEDINGS.

WE MAY FACE LEGAL CLAIMS OR REGULATORY MATTERS INVOLVING STOCKHOLDER, CONSUMER, COMPETITION, AND OTHER ISSUES ON A GLOBAL BASIS. AS DESCRIBED IN "

NOTE 25: CONTINGENCIES

" IN PART II, ITEM 8 OF THIS FORM 10-K, WE ARE ENGAGED IN A NUMBER OF LITIGATION AND REGULATORY MATTERS. LITIGATION AND REGULATORY PROCEEDINGS ARE INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN, AND ADVERSE RULINGS COULD OCCUR, INCLUDING MONETARY DAMAGES, OR AN INJUNCTION STOPPING US FROM MANUFACTURING OR SELLING CERTAIN PRODUCTS, ENGAGING IN CERTAIN BUSINESS PRACTICES, OR REQUIRING OTHER REMEDIES, SUCH AS COMPULSORY LICENSING OF PATENTS. AN UNFAVORABLE OUTCOME MAY RESULT IN A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR BUSINESS, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL POSITION, AND OVERALL TRENDS. IN ADDITION, REGARDLESS OF THE OUTCOME, LITIGATION CAN BE COSTLY, TIME-CONSUMING, DISRUPTIVE TO OUR OPERATIONS, AND DISTRACTING TO MANAGEMENT.

WE MUST ATTRACT, RETAIN, AND MOTIVATE KEY EMPLOYEES.

TO BE COMPETITIVE, WE MUST ATTRACT, RETAIN, AND MOTIVATE EXECUTIVES AND OTHER KEY EMPLOYEES. HIRING AND RETAINING QUALIFIED EXECUTIVES, SCIENTISTS, ENGINEERS, TECHNICAL STAFF, AND SALES REPRESENTATIVES ARE CRITICAL TO OUR BUSINESS, AND COMPETITION FOR EXPERIENCED EMPLOYEES CAN BE INTENSE. TO HELP ATTRACT, RETAIN, AND MOTIVATE QUALIFIED EMPLOYEES, WE USE SHARE-BASED AND OTHER PERFORMANCE-BASED INCENTIVE AWARDS SUCH AS RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS AND CASH BONUSES. IF OUR SHARE-BASED OR OTHER COMPENSATION PROGRAMS CEASE TO BE VIEWED AS COMPETITIVE AND VALUABLE BENEFITS, OUR ABILITY TO ATTRACT, RETAIN, AND MOTIVATE EMPLOYEES COULD BE WEAKENED, WHICH COULD HARM OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

WE ARE SUBJECT TO CYBERSECURITY AND PRIVACY RISKS.

THIRD PARTIES MIGHT ATTEMPT TO GAIN UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS TO OUR NETWORK OR SEEK TO COMPROMISE OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES.

WE REGULARLY FACE ATTEMPTS BY OTHERS TO GAIN UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS THROUGH THE INTERNET OR TO INTRODUCE MALICIOUS SOFTWARE TO OUR INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY (IT) SYSTEMS. ADDITIONALLY, MALICIOUS HACKERS MAY ATTEMPT TO GAIN UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS AND CORRUPT THE PROCESSES OF HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE PRODUCTS THAT WE MANUFACTURE AND SERVICES WE PROVIDE. DUE TO THE WIDESPREAD USE OF OUR PRODUCTS AND DUE TO THE HIGH PROFILE OF OUR MCAFEE SUBSIDIARY, WE OR OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES ARE A FREQUENT TARGET OF COMPUTER HACKERS AND ORGANIZATIONS THAT INTEND TO SABOTAGE, TAKE CONTROL OF, OR OTHERWISE CORRUPT OUR MANUFACTURING OR OTHER PROCESSES, PRODUCTS, AND SERVICES. WE ARE ALSO A TARGET OF MALICIOUS ATTACKERS WHO ATTEMPT TO GAIN ACCESS TO OUR NETWORK OR DATA CENTERS OR THOSE OF OUR CUSTOMERS OR END USERS; STEAL PROPRIETARY INFORMATION RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS, PRODUCTS, EMPLOYEES, AND CUSTOMERS; OR INTERRUPT OUR SYSTEMS AND SERVICES OR THOSE OF OUR CUSTOMERS OR OTHERS. WE BELIEVE SUCH ATTEMPTS ARE INCREASING IN NUMBER AND IN TECHNICAL SOPHISTICATION. FROM TIME TO TIME WE ENCOUNTER INTRUSIONS OR ATTEMPTS AT GAINING UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS TO OUR PRODUCTS, SERVICES, AND NETWORK. TO DATE, NONE HAVE RESULTED IN ANY MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT TO OUR BUSINESS OR OPERATIONS. IN SOME INSTANCES, WE, OUR CUSTOMERS, AND THE USERS OF OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES MIGHT BE UNAWARE OF AN INCIDENT OR ITS MAGNITUDE AND EFFECTS. WHILE WE SEEK TO DETECT AND INVESTIGATE ALL UNAUTHORIZED ATTEMPTS AND ATTACKS AGAINST OUR NETWORK, PRODUCTS, AND SERVICES, AND TO PREVENT THEIR RECURRENCE WHERE PRACTICABLE THROUGH CHANGES TO OUR INTERNAL PROCESSES AND TOOLS AND/OR CHANGES OR PATCHES TO OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, WE REMAIN POTENTIALLY VULNERABLE TO ADDITIONAL KNOWN OR UNKNOWN THREATS. SUCH INCIDENTS, WHETHER SUCCESSFUL OR UNSUCCESSFUL, COULD RESULT IN OUR INCURRING SIGNIFICANT COSTS RELATED TO, FOR EXAMPLE, REBUILDING INTERNAL SYSTEMS, REDUCED INVENTORY VALUE, PROVIDING MODIFICATIONS TO OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, DEFENDING AGAINST LITIGATION, RESPONDING TO REGULATORY INQUIRIES OR ACTIONS, PAYING DAMAGES, OR TAKING OTHER REMEDIAL STEPS WITH RESPECT TO THIRD PARTIES. IN ADDITION, THESE THREATS ARE CONSTANTLY EVOLVING, THEREBY INCREASING THE DIFFICULTY OF SUCCESSFULLY DEFENDING AGAINST THEM OR IMPLEMENTING ADEQUATE PREVENTATIVE MEASURES. PUBLICITY ABOUT VULNERABILITIES AND ATTEMPTED OR SUCCESSFUL INCURSIONS COULD DAMAGE OUR REPUTATION WITH CUSTOMERS OR USERS, AND REDUCE DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES.

WE MAY BE SUBJECT TO THEFT, LOSS, OR MISUSE OF PERSONAL DATA ABOUT OUR EMPLOYEES, CUSTOMERS, OR OTHER THIRD PARTIES, WHICH COULD INCREASE OUR EXPENSES, DAMAGE OUR REPUTATION, OR RESULT IN LEGAL OR REGULATORY PROCEEDINGS.

THE THEFT, LOSS, OR MISUSE OF PERSONAL DATA COLLECTED, USED, STORED, OR TRANSFERRED BY US TO RUN OUR BUSINESS COULD RESULT IN SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED SECURITY COSTS OR COSTS RELATED TO DEFENDING LEGAL CLAIMS. GLOBAL PRIVACY LEGISLATION, ENFORCEMENT, AND POLICY ACTIVITY IN THIS AREA ARE RAPIDLY EXPANDING AND CREATING A COMPLEX COMPLIANCE REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT. COSTS TO COMPLY WITH AND IMPLEMENT THESE PRIVACY-RELATED AND DATA PROTECTION MEASURES COULD BE SIGNIFICANT. IN ADDITION, OUR EVEN INADVERTENT FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH FEDERAL, STATE, OR INTERNATIONAL PRIVACY-RELATED OR DATA PROTECTION LAWS AND REGULATIONS COULD RESULT IN PROCEEDINGS AGAINST US BY GOVERNMENTAL ENTITIES OR OTHERS.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

WE ARE SUBJECT TO RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH STRATEGIC TRANSACTIONS.

WE INVEST IN COMPANIES FOR STRATEGIC REASONS AND MAY NOT REALIZE A RETURN ON OUR INVESTMENTS.

WE MAKE INVESTMENTS IN PUBLIC AND PRIVATE COMPANIES AROUND THE WORLD TO FURTHER OUR STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES AND SUPPORT KEY BUSINESS INITIATIVES. MANY OF THE SECURITIES IN WHICH WE INVEST ARE NON-MARKETABLE AT THE TIME OF OUR INITIAL INVESTMENT. COMPANIES IN WHICH WE INVEST RANGE FROM EARLY-STAGE COMPANIES STILL DEFINING THEIR STRATEGIC DIRECTION TO MATURE COMPANIES WITH ESTABLISHED REVENUE STREAMS AND BUSINESS MODELS. THE SUCCESS OF OUR INVESTMENT IN ANY COMPANY IS TYPICALLY DEPENDENT ON THE AVAILABILITY TO THE COMPANY OF ADDITIONAL FUNDING ON FAVORABLE TERMS, OR A LIQUIDITY EVENT, SUCH AS A PUBLIC OFFERING OR ACQUISITION. IF ANY OF THE COMPANIES IN WHICH WE INVEST FAIL, WE COULD LOSE ALL OR PART OF OUR INVESTMENT. IF WE DETERMINE THAT AN OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY DECLINE IN THE FAIR VALUE EXISTS FOR AN INVESTMENT, WE WRITE DOWN THE INVESTMENT TO ITS FAIR VALUE AND RECOGNIZE A LOSS.

OUR ACQUISITIONS, DIVESTITURES, AND OTHER TRANSACTIONS COULD FAIL TO ACHIEVE STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES, DISRUPT OUR ONGOING BUSINESS AND HARM OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

IN PURSUING OUR BUSINESS STRATEGY, WE ROUTINELY CONDUCT DISCUSSIONS, EVALUATE OPPORTUNITIES, AND ENTER INTO AGREEMENTS FOR POSSIBLE ACQUISITIONS, DIVESTITURES, AND OTHER TRANSACTIONS, SUCH AS JOINT VENTURES. GIVEN THAT OUR RESOURCES ARE LIMITED, OUR DECISION TO COMPLETE AN ACQUISITION HAS OPPORTUNITY COSTS AND WE MAY NEED TO FOREGO THE PROSPECT OF ACQUIRING OTHER COMPANIES OR TECHNOLOGIES THAT COULD HELP US ACHIEVE OUR STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES. IN ADDITION TO OPPORTUNITY COSTS, THESE TRANSACTIONS INVOLVE LARGE CHALLENGES AND RISKS, INCLUDING RISKS THAT.

•

THE TRANSACTION MAY NOT ADVANCE OUR BUSINESS STRATEGY;

•

WE MAY BE UNABLE TO IDENTIFY OPPORTUNITIES ON TERMS ACCEPTABLE TO US;

•

WE MAY NOT REALIZE A SATISFACTORY RETURN;

•

WE MAY EXPERIENCE DISRUPTION OF OUR ONGOING OPERATIONS;

•

WE MAY BE UNABLE TO RETAIN KEY PERSONNEL;

•

WE MAY EXPERIENCE DIFFICULTY IN INTEGRATING NEW EMPLOYEES, BUSINESS SYSTEMS, AND TECHNOLOGY;

•

ACQUIRED BUSINESSES MAY NOT HAVE ADEQUATE CONTROLS, PROCESSES, AND PROCEDURES TO ENSURE COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS AND REGULATIONS, AND OUR DUE DILIGENCE PROCESS MAY NOT IDENTIFY COMPLIANCE ISSUES OR OTHER LIABILITIES;

•

WE MAY HAVE DIFFICULTY ENTERING NEW MARKET SEGMENTS;

•

WE MAY BE UNABLE TO RETAIN THE CUSTOMERS AND PARTNERS OF ACQUIRED BUSINESSES; AND/OR

•

THERE MAY BE UNKNOWN, UNDERESTIMATED, AND/OR UNDISCLOSED COMMITMENTS OR LIABILITIES.

WHEN WE DECIDE TO SELL ASSETS OR A BUSINESS, WE MAY HAVE DIFFICULTY SELLING ON ACCEPTABLE TERMS IN A TIMELY MANNER, AND THE AGREED-UPON TERMS AND FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS COULD BE RENEGOTIATED DUE TO CHANGES IN BUSINESS OR MARKET CONDITIONS. THESE CIRCUMSTANCES COULD DELAY THE ACHIEVEMENT OF OUR STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES OR CAUSE US TO INCUR ADDITIONAL EXPENSE, OR WE MAY SELL A BUSINESS AT A PRICE OR ON TERMS THAT ARE LESS FAVORABLE THAN WE HAD ANTICIPATED, RESULTING IN A LOSS ON THE TRANSACTION.

IF WE DO ENTER INTO AGREEMENTS WITH RESPECT TO ACQUISITIONS, DIVESTITURES, OR OTHER TRANSACTIONS, WE MAY FAIL TO COMPLETE THEM DUE TO FACTORS SUCH AS.

•

FAILURE TO OBTAIN REGULATORY OR OTHER APPROVALS;

•

IP DISPUTES OR OTHER LITIGATION; OR

•

DIFFICULTIES OBTAINING FINANCING FOR THE TRANSACTION.

WE ARE SUBJECT TO SALES-RELATED RISKS.

WE FACE RISKS RELATED TO SALES THROUGH DISTRIBUTORS AND OTHER THIRD PARTIES.

WE SELL A SIGNIFICANT PORTION

OF OUR PRODUCTS THROUGH THIRD PARTIES SUCH AS DISTRIBUTORS, VALUE-ADDED RESELLERS, OEMS, INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDERS, AND CHANNEL PARTNERS (COLLECTIVELY REFERRED TO AS DISTRIBUTORS). USING THIRD PARTIES FOR DISTRIBUTION EXPOSES US TO MANY RISKS, INCLUDING COMPETITIVE PRESSURE, CONCENTRATION, CREDIT RISK, AND COMPLIANCE RISKS. DISTRIBUTORS MAY SELL PRODUCTS THAT COMPETE WITH OUR PRODUCTS, AND WE MAY NEED TO PROVIDE FINANCIAL AND OTHER INCENTIVES TO FOCUS DISTRIBUTORS ON THE SALE OF OUR PRODUCTS. WE MAY RELY ON ONE OR MORE KEY DISTRIBUTORS FOR A PRODUCT, AND THE LOSS OF THESE DISTRIBUTORS COULD REDUCE OUR REVENUE. DISTRIBUTORS MAY FACE FINANCIAL DIFFICULTIES, INCLUDING BANKRUPTCY, WHICH COULD HARM OUR COLLECTION OF ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND FINANCIAL RESULTS. VIOLATIONS OF THE FOREIGN CORRUPT PRACTICES ACT (FCPA) OR SIMILAR LAWS BY DISTRIBUTORS OR OTHER THIRD-PARTY INTERMEDIARIES COULD HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR BUSINESS. FAILURE TO MANAGE RISKS RELATED TO OUR USE OF DISTRIBUTORS MAY REDUCE SALES, INCREASE EXPENSES, AND WEAKEN OUR COMPETITIVE POSITION.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

WE FACE RISKS RELATED TO BUSINESS TRANSACTIONS WITH U.S. GOVERNMENT ENTITIES.

WE RECEIVE PROCEEDS FROM SERVICES AND PRODUCTS WE PROVIDE TO THE U.S. GOVERNMENT. U.S. GOVERNMENT DEMAND AND PAYMENT MAY BE AFFECTED BY PUBLIC SECTOR BUDGETARY CYCLES AND FUNDING AUTHORIZATIONS. U.S. GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS ARE SUBJECT TO OVERSIGHT, INCLUDING SPECIAL RULES ON ACCOUNTING, IP RIGHTS, EXPENSES, REVIEWS, INFORMATION HANDLING, AND SECURITY. FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH THESE RULES COULD RESULT IN CIVIL AND CRIMINAL PENALTIES AND SANCTIONS, INCLUDING TERMINATION OF CONTRACTS, FINES, AND SUSPENSIONS, OR DEBARMENT FROM FUTURE U.S. GOVERNMENT BUSINESS.

OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COULD VARY AS A RESULT OF THE METHODS, ESTIMATES, AND JUDGMENTS THAT WE USE IN APPLYING ACCOUNTING POLICIES.

THE METHODS, ESTIMATES, AND JUDGMENTS THAT WE USE IN APPLYING ACCOUNTING POLICIES HAVE A LARGE IMPACT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. FOR MORE INFORMATION, SEE "CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES" IN PART II, ITEM 7 OF THIS FORM 10-K. THESE METHODS, ESTIMATES, AND JUDGMENTS ARE SUBJECT TO LARGE RISKS, UNCERTAINTIES, AND ASSUMPTIONS, AND CHANGES COULD AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

CHANGES IN OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE MAY REDUCE OUR NET INCOME.

A NUMBER OF FACTORS MAY INCREASE OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATES, WHICH COULD REDUCE OUR NET INCOME, INCLUDING.

•

THE JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH PROFITS ARE DETERMINED TO BE EARNED AND TAXED;

•

THE RESOLUTION OF ISSUES ARISING FROM TAX AUDITS;

•

CHANGES IN THE VALUATION OF OUR DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, AND IN DEFERRED TAX VALUATION ALLOWANCES;

•

ADJUSTMENTS TO INCOME TAXES UPON FINALIZATION OF TAX RETURNS;

•

INCREASES IN EXPENSES NOT DEDUCTIBLE FOR TAX PURPOSES, INCLUDING IMPAIRMENTS OF GOODWILL;

•

CHANGES IN AVAILABLE TAX CREDITS;

•

CHANGES IN TAX LAWS OR THEIR INTERPRETATION, INCLUDING CHANGES IN THE U.S. TO THE TAXATION OF MANUFACTURING ENTERPRISES AND OF NON-U.S. INCOME AND EXPENSES;

•

CHANGES IN U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES; AND

•

OUR DECISION TO REPATRIATE NON-U.S. EARNINGS FOR WHICH WE HAVE NOT PREVIOUSLY PROVIDED FOR U.S. TAXES.

WE MAY HAVE FLUCTUATIONS IN THE AMOUNT AND FREQUENCY OF OUR STOCK REPURCHASES.

THE AMOUNT, TIMING, AND OTHER EXECUTION OF OUR STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM MAY FLUCTUATE BASED ON OUR PRIORITIES FOR THE USE OF CASH FOR OTHER PURPOSES, SUCH AS INVESTING IN OUR BUSINESS, INCLUDING OPERATIONAL SPENDING, CAPITAL SPENDING, AND ACQUISITIONS, AND RETURNING CASH TO OUR STOCKHOLDERS AS DIVIDEND PAYMENTS, AND BECAUSE OF CHANGES IN CASH FLOWS AND CHANGES IN TAX LAWS.

WORKFORCE RESTRUCTURING ACTIONS MAY BE DISRUPTIVE TO OUR OPERATIONS AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS.

IN RESPONSE TO THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT AND TO ACCOMPLISH OUR STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES, FROM TIME TO TIME WE MAY RESTRUCTURE OUR OPERATIONS OR MAKE OTHER ADJUSTMENTS TO OUR WORKFORCE. SUCH WORKFORCE CHANGES CAN RESULT IN RESTRUCTURING CHARGES IN ADDITION TO THOSE DESCRIBED IN "

NOTE 13: RESTRUCTURING AND ASSET IMPAIRMENT CHARGES

" IN PART II, ITEM 8 OF THIS FORM 10-K. SUCH WORKFORCE CHANGES CAN ALSO TEMPORARILY REDUCE WORKFORCE PRODUCTIVITY, WHICH COULD BE DISRUPTIVE TO OUR BUSINESS AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. IN ADDITION, WE MAY NOT ACHIEVE OR SUSTAIN THE EXPECTED COST SAVINGS OR OTHER BENEFITS OF OUR RESTRUCTURING PLANS, OR DO SO WITHIN THE EXPECTED TIME FRAME.

THERE ARE INHERENT LIMITATIONS ON THE EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR CONTROLS.

WE DO NOT EXPECT THAT OUR DISCLOSURE CONTROLS OR OUR INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING WILL PREVENT OR DETECT ALL ERRORS AND ALL FRAUD. A CONTROL SYSTEM, NO MATTER HOW WELL-DESIGNED AND OPERATED, CAN PROVIDE ONLY REASONABLE, NOT ABSOLUTE, ASSURANCE THAT THE CONTROL SYSTEM’S OBJECTIVES WILL BE MET. THE DESIGN OF A CONTROL SYSTEM MUST REFLECT THE FACT THAT RESOURCE CONSTRAINTS EXIST, AND THE BENEFITS OF CONTROLS MUST BE CONSIDERED RELATIVE TO THEIR COSTS. FURTHER, BECAUSE OF THE INHERENT LIMITATIONS IN ALL CONTROL SYSTEMS, NO EVALUATION OF CONTROLS CAN PROVIDE ABSOLUTE ASSURANCE THAT MISSTATEMENTS DUE TO ERROR OR FRAUD WILL NOT OCCUR OR THAT ALL CONTROL ISSUES AND INSTANCES OF FRAUD, IF ANY, HAVE BEEN DETECTED. THE DESIGN OF ANY SYSTEM OF CONTROLS IS BASED IN PART ON CERTAIN ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT THE LIKELIHOOD OF FUTURE EVENTS, AND THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT ANY DESIGN WILL SUCCEED IN ACHIEVING ITS STATED GOALS UNDER ALL POTENTIAL FUTURE CONDITIONS. PROJECTIONS OF ANY EVALUATION OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF CONTROLS TO FUTURE PERIODS ARE SUBJECT TO RISKS. OVER TIME, CONTROLS MAY BECOME INADEQUATE DUE TO CHANGES IN CONDITIONS OR DETERIORATION IN THE DEGREE OF COMPLIANCE WITH POLICIES OR PROCEDURES. IF OUR CONTROLS BECOME INADEQUATE, WE COULD FAIL TO MEET OUR FINANCIAL REPORTING OBLIGATIONS, OUR REPUTATION MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED, OUR BUSINESS AND OPERATING RESULTS COULD BE HARMED, AND THE MARKET PRICE OF OUR STOCK COULD DECLINE.

OUR PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE OFFICES ARE LOCATED IN THE U.S. AND A MAJORITY OF OUR WAFER FABRICATION ACTIVITIES ARE ALSO LOCATED IN THE U.S. WE COMPLETED CONSTRUCTION OF OUR NEW DEVELOPMENT FABRICATION FACILITIES IN OREGON DURING 2014 AND EXPECT THAT THESE NEW FACILITIES WILL ALLOW US TO WIDEN OUR PROCESS TECHNOLOGY LEAD. WE ALSO COMPLETED CONSTRUCTION OF A LARGE-SCALE FABRICATION BUILDING IN ARIZONA IN 2013, WHICH IS CURRENTLY NOT IN USE AND IS NOT BEING DEPRECIATED. INCREMENTAL CONSTRUCTION AND EQUIPMENT INSTALLATION ARE REQUIRED TO READY THE BUILDING FOR ITS INTENDED USE. WE HAVE LEVERAGED EXISTING FABRICATION FACILITIES, RESERVING THIS NEW BUILDING FOR ADDITIONAL CAPACITY AND FUTURE TECHNOLOGIES.

OUR MASSACHUSETTS FABRICATION FACILITY IS OUR LAST MANUFACTURING FACILITY ON

200MM

WAFERS AND IS EXPECTED TO CEASE PRODUCTION IN Q1 2015.

OUTSIDE THE U.S., WE HAVE WAFER FABRICATION FACILITIES IN ISRAEL, CHINA, AND IRELAND.

OUR FABRICATION FACILITY IN IRELAND IS CURRENTLY TRANSITIONING TO OUR 14NM PROCESS TECHNOLOGY, WITH MANUFACTURING EXPECTED TO RAMP IN THE SECOND HALF OF 2015.

OUR ASSEMBLY AND TEST FACILITIES ARE LOCATED IN

MALAYSIA, CHINA, AND VIETNAM

. IN ADDITION, WE HAVE SALES AND MARKETING OFFICES WORLDWIDE THAT ARE GENERALLY LOCATED NEAR MAJOR CONCENTRATIONS OF CUSTOMERS.

WE BELIEVE THAT THE FACILITIES DESCRIBED ABOVE ARE SUITABLE AND ADEQUATE FOR OUR PRESENT PURPOSES AND THAT THE PRODUCTIVE CAPACITY IN OUR FACILITIES IS SUBSTANTIALLY BEING UTILIZED OR WE HAVE PLANS TO UTILIZE IT.

. DCG ACHIEVED

NET REVENUE GROWTH AND

Q1 2015.

GROSS MARGIN IMPROVED BY APPROXIMATELY THREE AND A HALF PERCENTAGE POINTS FROM

Q4 2013

. THE INCREASE FROM

Q4 2013

WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER FACTORY START-UP COSTS, LOWER PCCG AND DCG PLATFORM (PLATFORM) UNIT COSTS, HIGHER PLATFORM AVERAGE SELLING PRICES, AND HIGHER PLATFORM UNIT SALES. THESE ITEMS WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE IMPACT OF HIGHER CASH CONSIDERATION ASSOCIATED WITH OUR TABLET PLATFORM AND HIGHER PRODUCTION COSTS ON OUR 14NM PRODUCTS TREATED AS PERIOD CHARGES.

DRIVEN BY LOWER PLATFORM UNIT COSTS, LOWER START-UP COSTS, AND HIGHER PLATFORM VOLUMES. THESE INCREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER COST OF SALES ASSOCIATED WITH HIGHER TABLET PLATFORM UNIT SALES AND CASH CONSIDERATION PROVIDED TO OUR CUSTOMERS ASSOCIATED WITH INTEGRATING OUR TABLET PLATFORM.

IN

2014

, WE STARTED GROWING AGAIN ACROSS A BROAD RANGE OF PRODUCTS AND MARKETS BY INTRODUCING MANY NEW PRODUCT TECHNOLOGIES ACROSS ALL OF OUR BUSINESSES. WE BEGAN SHIPPING THE WORLD'S FIRST PROCESSOR ON 14NM PROCESS TECHNOLOGY. ADDITIONALLY, WE LAUNCHED A NEW FAMILY OF PROCESSORS, INTEL CORE M. INTEL CORE M PROCESSOR IS ENABLING NEW DESIGNS AND FORM FACTORS WITH ITS FULL CORE PERFORMANCE IN BOTH COMPUTE AND GRAPHICS. WE RECENTLY LAUNCHED INTEL REALSENSE TECHNOLOGY, WHICH INCLUDES SOFTWARE AND DEPTH CAMERAS THAT ENABLE MORE NATURAL AND INTUITIVE INTERACTION WITH PERSONAL COMPUTING DEVICES. IN THE WIRELESS BUSINESS, WE QUALIFIED OUR FIRST SOC APPLICATION PROCESSOR AND BASEBAND 3G SOLUTION, CODE-NAMED "SOFIA." WE ALSO EXCEEDED OUR GOAL OF 40 MILLION TABLET PLATFORM UNIT SALES IN 2014.

THE CASH GENERATION FROM OUR BUSINESS REMAINED STRONG, WITH CASH FROM OPERATIONS OF

$20.4 BILLION

IN

2014

. WE ENDED THE YEAR WITH AN INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO OF $14.1 BILLION, DOWN APPROXIMATELY $6.0 BILLION FROM A YEAR AGO. OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO CONSISTED OF CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS, SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS, AND TRADING ASSETS. WE PURCHASED

$10.1 BILLION

IN CAPITAL ASSETS, DOWN FROM OUR PRIOR OUTLOOK OF $11.0 BILLION AS WE FOUND EFFICIENCIES, OPTIMIZED OUR MANUFACTURING NETWORK, AND INCREASED OUR FACTORY UTILIZATION. IN ADDITION, WE RETURNED

$4.4 BILLION

TO STOCKHOLDERS THROUGH DIVIDENDS AND REPURCHASED

$10.8 BILLION

OF COMMON STOCK THROUGH OUR COMMON STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM. OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS AUTHORIZED AN INCREASE OF $20 BILLION TO THE COMMON STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM. EFFECTIVE IN Q1 2015, OUR ANNUAL DIVIDEND INCREASED TO $0.96 PER SHARE AND OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS DECLARED A CASH DIVIDEND OF

$0.24

PER SHARE OF COMMON STOCK.

LOOKING AHEAD TO

2015

, WE ARE FORECASTING REVENUE TO GROW IN THE MID-SINGLE DIGITS AND THE MIDPOINT OF OUR GROSS MARGIN RANGE TO BE AT 62% PLUS OR MINUS A COUPLE OF POINTS. ADDITIONALLY, WE ARE FORECASTING R&D AND MG&A SPENDING TO BE APPROXIMATELY $20.0 BILLION PLUS OR MINUS $400 MILLION AND FORECASTING CAPITAL SPENDING OF $10.0 BILLION PLUS OR MINUS $500 MILLION. FOR

Q1 2015

, WE ARE FORECASTING THE MIDPOINT OF THE REVENUE RANGE TO BE $13.7 BILLION PLUS OR MINUS $500 MILLION, DOWN APPROXIMATELY 7% FROM

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

THE METHODS, ESTIMATES, AND JUDGMENTS THAT WE USE IN APPLYING OUR ACCOUNTING POLICIES HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE RESULTS THAT WE REPORT IN OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. SOME OF OUR ACCOUNTING POLICIES REQUIRE US TO MAKE DIFFICULT AND SUBJECTIVE JUDGMENTS, OFTEN AS A RESULT OF THE NEED TO MAKE ESTIMATES REGARDING MATTERS THAT ARE INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN. OUR MOST CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES INCLUDE.

•

THE VALUATION OF NON-MARKETABLE EQUITY INVESTMENTS AND THE DETERMINATION OF OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENTS, WHICH IMPACT GAINS (LOSSES) ON EQUITY INVESTMENTS, NET WHEN WE RECORD IMPAIRMENTS;

•

THE ASSESSMENT OF RECOVERABILITY OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS (PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT; GOODWILL; AND IDENTIFIED INTANGIBLES), WHICH IMPACTS GROSS MARGIN OR OPERATING EXPENSES WHEN WE RECORD ASSET IMPAIRMENTS OR ACCELERATE THEIR DEPRECIATION OR AMORTIZATION;

•

THE RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT OF CURRENT AND DEFERRED INCOME TAXES (INCLUDING THE MEASUREMENT OF UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS), WHICH IMPACT OUR PROVISION FOR TAXES;

•

THE VALUATION OF INVENTORY, WHICH IMPACTS GROSS MARGIN; AND

•

THE RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT OF LOSS CONTINGENCIES, WHICH IMPACT GROSS MARGIN OR OPERATING EXPENSES WHEN WE RECOGNIZE A LOSS CONTINGENCY, REVISE THE ESTIMATE FOR A LOSS CONTINGENCY, OR RECORD AN ASSET IMPAIRMENT.

IN THE FOLLOWING SECTION, WE DISCUSS THESE POLICIES FURTHER, AS WELL AS THE ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS INVOLVED.

NON-MARKETABLE EQUITY INVESTMENTS

WE REGULARLY INVEST IN NON-MARKETABLE EQUITY INSTRUMENTS OF PRIVATE COMPANIES, WHICH RANGE FROM EARLY-STAGE COMPANIES THAT ARE OFTEN STILL DEFINING THEIR STRATEGIC DIRECTION TO MORE MATURE COMPANIES WITH ESTABLISHED REVENUE STREAMS AND BUSINESS MODELS. THE CARRYING VALUE OF OUR NON-MARKETABLE EQUITY INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO, EXCLUDING EQUITY DERIVATIVES, TOTALED

$3.2 BILLION

AS OF

DECEMBER 27, 2014

(

$2.3 BILLION

AS OF

DECEMBER 28, 2013

).

OUR NON-MARKETABLE EQUITY INVESTMENTS ARE RECORDED USING THE COST METHOD OR THE EQUITY METHOD OF ACCOUNTING, DEPENDING ON THE FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES OF EACH INVESTMENT. OUR NON-MARKETABLE EQUITY INVESTMENTS ARE CLASSIFIED WITHIN OTHER LONG-TERM ASSETS ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS.

NON-MARKETABLE EQUITY INVESTMENTS ARE INHERENTLY RISKY, AND THEIR SUCCESS DEPENDS ON PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT, MARKET ACCEPTANCE, OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCY, AND OTHER KEY BUSINESS FACTORS. THE COMPANIES COULD FAIL OR NOT BE ABLE TO RAISE ADDITIONAL FUNDS WHEN NEEDED, OR THEY MAY RECEIVE LOWER VALUATIONS WITH LESS FAVORABLE INVESTMENT TERMS THAN PREVIOUS FINANCINGS. THESE EVENTS COULD CAUSE OUR INVESTMENTS TO BECOME IMPAIRED. IN ADDITION, FINANCIAL MARKET VOLATILITY COULD NEGATIVELY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO REALIZE VALUE IN OUR INVESTMENTS THROUGH LIQUIDITY EVENTS SUCH AS INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERINGS, MERGERS, AND PRIVATE SALES. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO RISKS, SEE "RISK FACTORS" IN PART I, ITEM 1A OF THIS FORM 10-K.

WE DETERMINE THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR NON-MARKETABLE EQUITY INVESTMENTS PORTFOLIO QUARTERLY FOR IMPAIRMENT AND DISCLOSURE PURPOSES; HOWEVER, THE INVESTMENTS ARE RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE ONLY IF AN IMPAIRMENT IS RECOGNIZED. THE MEASUREMENT OF FAIR VALUE REQUIRES SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT AND INCLUDES A QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS OF EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES THAT IMPACT THE FAIR VALUE OF THE INVESTMENT. QUALITATIVE ANALYSIS OF OUR INVESTMENTS INVOLVES UNDERSTANDING OUR INVESTEE’S REVENUE AND EARNINGS TRENDS RELATIVE TO PRE-DEFINED MILESTONES AND OVERALL BUSINESS PROSPECTS, THE TECHNOLOGICAL FEASIBILITY OF OUR INVESTEE’S PRODUCTS AND TECHNOLOGIES, THE GENERAL MARKET CONDITIONS IN THE INVESTEE’S INDUSTRY OR GEOGRAPHIC AREA INCLUDING ADVERSE REGULATORY OR ECONOMIC CHANGES, AND THE MANAGEMENT AND GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE OF THE INVESTEE. QUANTITATIVE ASSESSMENTS OF THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR INVESTMENTS ARE DEVELOPED USING THE MARKET AND INCOME APPROACHES. THE MARKET APPROACH INCLUDES THE USE OF FINANCIAL METRICS AND RATIOS OF COMPARABLE PUBLIC COMPANIES, SUCH AS REVENUE, EARNINGS, COMPARABLE PERFORMANCE MULTIPLES, RECENT FINANCING ROUNDS, THE TERMS OF THE INVESTEES’ ISSUED INTERESTS, AND THE LEVEL OF MARKETABILITY OF THE INVESTMENTS. THE SELECTION OF COMPARABLE COMPANIES REQUIRES MANAGEMENT JUDGMENT AND IS BASED ON A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING COMPARABLE COMPANIES’ SIZES, GROWTH RATES, INDUSTRIES, AND DEVELOPMENT STAGES. THE INCOME APPROACH INCLUDES THE USE OF A DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW MODEL, WHICH REQUIRES SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES REGARDING THE INVESTEES' REVENUE, COSTS, AND DISCOUNT RATES BASED ON THE RISK PROFILE OF COMPARABLE COMPANIES. ESTIMATES OF REVENUE AND COSTS ARE DEVELOPED USING AVAILABLE MARKET, HISTORICAL, AND FORECAST DATA.

IF THE FAIR VALUE OF AN INVESTMENT IS BELOW OUR CARRYING VALUE, WE DETERMINE WHETHER THE INVESTMENT IS OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARILY IMPAIRED BASED ON OUR QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE ANALYSIS, WHICH INCLUDES ASSESSING THE SEVERITY AND DURATION OF THE IMPAIRMENT AND THE LIKELIHOOD OF RECOVERY BEFORE DISPOSAL. IF THE INVESTMENT IS CONSIDERED TO BE OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARILY IMPAIRED, WE RECORD THE INVESTMENT AT FAIR VALUE BY RECOGNIZING AN IMPAIRMENT. IMPAIRMENTS OF NON-MARKETABLE EQUITY INVESTMENTS WERE

IN

2014

LONG-LIVED ASSETS

PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT

WE ASSESS PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT FOR IMPAIRMENT WHEN EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THAT THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE ASSETS OR THE ASSET GROUPING MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE. FACTORS THAT WE CONSIDER IN DECIDING WHEN TO PERFORM AN IMPAIRMENT REVIEW INCLUDE SIGNIFICANT UNDER-PERFORMANCE OF A BUSINESS OR PRODUCT LINE IN RELATION TO EXPECTATIONS, SIGNIFICANT NEGATIVE INDUSTRY OR ECONOMIC TRENDS, AND SIGNIFICANT CHANGES OR PLANNED CHANGES IN OUR USE OF THE ASSETS. WE MEASURE THE RECOVERABILITY OF ASSETS THAT WE WILL CONTINUE TO USE IN OUR OPERATIONS BY COMPARING THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE ASSET GROUPING TO OUR ESTIMATE OF THE RELATED TOTAL FUTURE UNDISCOUNTED NET CASH FLOWS. IF AN ASSET GROUPING’S CARRYING VALUE IS NOT RECOVERABLE THROUGH THE RELATED UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS, THE ASSET GROUPING IS CONSIDERED TO BE IMPAIRED. WE MEASURE THE IMPAIRMENT BY COMPARING THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE ASSET GROUPING’S CARRYING VALUE AND ITS FAIR VALUE. PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT IS CONSIDERED A NON-FINANCIAL ASSET AND IS RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE ONLY IF AN IMPAIRMENT CHARGE IS RECOGNIZED.

IMPAIRMENTS ARE DETERMINED FOR GROUPS OF ASSETS RELATED TO THE LOWEST LEVEL OF IDENTIFIABLE INDEPENDENT CASH FLOWS. DUE TO OUR ASSET USAGE MODEL AND THE INTERCHANGEABLE NATURE OF OUR SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING CAPACITY, WE MUST MAKE SUBJECTIVE JUDGMENTS IN DETERMINING THE INDEPENDENT CASH FLOWS THAT CAN BE RELATED TO SPECIFIC ASSET GROUPINGS. IN ADDITION, AS WE MAKE MANUFACTURING PROCESS CONVERSIONS AND OTHER FACTORY PLANNING DECISIONS, WE MUST MAKE SUBJECTIVE JUDGMENTS REGARDING THE REMAINING USEFUL LIVES OF ASSETS, PRIMARILY PROCESS-SPECIFIC SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING TOOLS AND BUILDING IMPROVEMENTS. WHEN WE DETERMINE THAT THE USEFUL LIVES OF ASSETS ARE SHORTER THAN WE HAD ORIGINALLY ESTIMATED, WE ACCELERATE THE RATE OF DEPRECIATION OVER THE ASSETS’ NEW, SHORTER USEFUL LIVES. BASED ON OUR ANALYSIS, IMPAIRMENTS AND ACCELERATED DEPRECIATION OF OUR PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT WAS

GOODWILL

GOODWILL IS RECORDED WHEN THE PURCHASE PRICE OF AN ACQUISITION EXCEEDS THE FAIR VALUE OF THE NET TANGIBLE AND IDENTIFIED INTANGIBLE ASSETS ACQUIRED. GOODWILL IS ALLOCATED TO OUR REPORTING UNITS BASED ON THE RELATIVE EXPECTED FAIR VALUE PROVIDED BY THE ACQUISITION. REPORTING UNITS MAY BE OPERATING SEGMENTS AS A WHOLE OR AN OPERATION ONE LEVEL BELOW AN OPERATING SEGMENT, REFERRED TO AS A COMPONENT. OUR REPORTING UNITS ARE CONSISTENT WITH THE OPERATING SEGMENTS IDENTIFIED IN "

NOTE 26: OPERATING SEGMENTS AND GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION

" IN PART II, ITEM 8 OF THIS FORM 10-K.

WE PERFORM AN ANNUAL IMPAIRMENT ASSESSMENT IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF EACH YEAR, OR MORE FREQUENTLY IF INDICATORS OF POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT EXIST

, TO DETERMINE WHETHER IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT THE FAIR VALUE OF A REPORTING UNIT IN WHICH GOODWILL RESIDES IS LESS THAN ITS CARRYING VALUE. FOR REPORTING UNITS IN WHICH THIS ASSESSMENT CONCLUDES THAT IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT THE FAIR VALUE IS MORE THAN ITS CARRYING VALUE, GOODWILL IS NOT CONSIDERED IMPAIRED AND WE ARE NOT REQUIRED TO PERFORM THE TWO-STEP GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT TEST. QUALITATIVE FACTORS CONSIDERED IN THIS ASSESSMENT INCLUDE INDUSTRY AND MARKET CONSIDERATIONS, OVERALL FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE, AND OTHER RELEVANT EVENTS AND FACTORS AFFECTING THE REPORTING UNIT. ADDITIONALLY, AS PART OF THIS ASSESSMENT, WE MAY PERFORM A QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS TO SUPPORT THE QUALITATIVE FACTORS ABOVE BY APPLYING SENSITIVITIES TO ASSUMPTIONS AND INPUTS USED IN MEASURING A REPORTING UNIT’S FAIR VALUE. FOR REPORTING UNITS IN WHICH THE IMPAIRMENT ASSESSMENT CONCLUDES THAT IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT THE FAIR VALUE IS LESS THAN ITS CARRYING VALUE, WE PERFORM THE FIRST STEP OF THE GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT TEST, WHICH COMPARES THE FAIR VALUE OF THE REPORTING UNIT TO ITS CARRYING VALUE. IF THE FAIR VALUE OF THE REPORTING UNIT EXCEEDS THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE NET ASSETS ASSIGNED TO THAT REPORTING UNIT, GOODWILL IS NOT CONSIDERED IMPAIRED AND WE ARE NOT REQUIRED TO PERFORM ADDITIONAL ANALYSIS. IF THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE NET ASSETS ASSIGNED TO THE REPORTING UNIT EXCEEDS THE FAIR VALUE OF THE REPORTING UNIT, THEN WE MUST PERFORM THE SECOND STEP OF THE GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT TEST TO DETERMINE THE IMPLIED FAIR VALUE OF THE REPORTING UNIT’S GOODWILL. IF WE DETERMINE DURING THE SECOND STEP THAT THE CARRYING VALUE OF A REPORTING UNIT’S GOODWILL EXCEEDS ITS IMPLIED FAIR VALUE, WE RECORD AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS EQUAL TO THE DIFFERENCE.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)

DETERMINING THE FAIR VALUE OF A REPORTING UNIT INVOLVES THE USE OF SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS. OUR GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT TEST USES A WEIGHTING OF THE INCOME METHOD AND THE MARKET METHOD TO ESTIMATE A REPORTING UNIT’S FAIR VALUE. THE INCOME METHOD IS BASED ON A DISCOUNTED FUTURE CASH FLOW APPROACH THAT USES THE FOLLOWING ASSUMPTIONS AND INPUTS: REVENUE, BASED ON ASSUMED MARKET SEGMENT GROWTH RATES AND OUR ASSUMED MARKET SEGMENT SHARE; ESTIMATED COSTS; AND APPROPRIATE DISCOUNT RATES BASED ON A REPORTING UNIT'S WEIGHTED AVERAGE COST OF CAPITAL AS DETERMINED BY CONSIDERING THE OBSERVABLE WEIGHTED AVERAGE COST OF CAPITAL OF COMPARABLE COMPANIES. OUR ESTIMATES OF MARKET SEGMENT GROWTH, OUR MARKET SEGMENT SHARE, AND COSTS ARE BASED ON HISTORICAL DATA, VARIOUS INTERNAL ESTIMATES, AND A VARIETY OF EXTERNAL SOURCES. THESE ESTIMATES ARE DEVELOPED AS PART OF OUR ROUTINE LONG-RANGE PLANNING PROCESS. THE SAME ESTIMATES ARE ALSO USED IN PLANNING FOR OUR LONG-TERM MANUFACTURING AND ASSEMBLY AND TEST CAPACITY NEEDS AS PART OF OUR CAPITAL BUDGETING PROCESS, AND FOR LONG-TERM AND SHORT-TERM BUSINESS PLANNING AND FORECASTING. WE TEST THE REASONABLENESS OF THE INPUTS AND OUTCOMES OF OUR DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW ANALYSIS AGAINST AVAILABLE COMPARABLE MARKET DATA. THE MARKET METHOD IS BASED ON FINANCIAL MULTIPLES OF COMPARABLE COMPANIES AND APPLIES A CONTROL PREMIUM. A REPORTING UNIT’S CARRYING VALUE REPRESENTS THE ASSIGNMENT OF VARIOUS ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, EXCLUDING CERTAIN CORPORATE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, SUCH AS CASH, INVESTMENTS, AND DEBT.

FOR THE ANNUAL IMPAIRMENT ASSESSMENT IN

2014

, WE DETERMINED THAT FOR EACH OF OUR REPORTING UNITS, IT WAS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT THE FAIR VALUE OF THE REPORTING UNITS EXCEEDED THE CARRYING VALUE. AS A RESULT, WE CONCLUDED THAT PERFORMING THE FIRST STEP OF THE GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT TEST WAS NOT NECESSARY FOR ANY REPORTING UNIT. DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF EACH OF THE PRIOR THREE FISCAL YEARS, WE HAVE COMPLETED OUR ANNUAL IMPAIRMENT ASSESSMENTS AND CONCLUDED THAT GOODWILL WAS NOT IMPAIRED IN ANY OF THESE YEARS.

IDENTIFIED INTANGIBLES

WE MAKE JUDGMENTS ABOUT THE RECOVERABILITY OF PURCHASED FINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS WHENEVER EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THAT AN IMPAIRMENT MAY EXIST. RECOVERABILITY OF FINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS IS MEASURED BY COMPARING THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF THE ASSET TO THE FUTURE UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS THAT THE ASSET IS EXPECTED TO GENERATE. WE PERFORM AN ANNUAL IMPAIRMENT ASSESSMENT IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF EACH YEAR FOR INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS, OR MORE FREQUENTLY IF INDICATORS OF POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT EXIST, TO DETERMINE WHETHER IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE ASSETS MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE. RECOVERABILITY OF INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS IS MEASURED BY COMPARING THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF THE ASSET TO THE FUTURE DISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS THAT THE ASSET IS EXPECTED TO GENERATE. IF WE DETERMINE THAT AN INDIVIDUAL ASSET IS IMPAIRED, THE AMOUNT OF ANY IMPAIRMENT IS MEASURED AS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE CARRYING VALUE AND THE FAIR VALUE OF THE ASSET.

THE ASSUMPTIONS AND ESTIMATES USED TO DETERMINE FUTURE VALUES AND REMAINING USEFUL LIVES OF OUR INTANGIBLE AND OTHER LONG-LIVED ASSETS ARE COMPLEX AND SUBJECTIVE. THEY CAN BE AFFECTED BY VARIOUS FACTORS, INCLUDING EXTERNAL FACTORS SUCH AS INDUSTRY AND ECONOMIC TRENDS, AND INTERNAL FACTORS SUCH AS CHANGES IN OUR BUSINESS STRATEGY AND OUR FORECASTS FOR SPECIFIC PRODUCT LINES. BASED ON OUR IMPAIRMENT ASSESSMENT, WE RECOGNIZED IMPAIRMENT CHARGES OF

$36 MILLION

IN

2014

(

$17 MILLION

IN

2013

AND

$21 MILLION

IN

2012

).

INCOME TAXES

WE MUST MAKE ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS IN DETERMINING THE PROVISION FOR TAXES FOR FINANCIAL STATEMENT PURPOSES. THESE ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS OCCUR IN THE CALCULATION OF TAX CREDITS, BENEFITS, AND DEDUCTIONS, AND IN THE CALCULATION OF CERTAIN TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES THAT ARISE FROM DIFFERENCES IN THE TIMING OF RECOGNITION OF REVENUE AND EXPENSE FOR TAX AND FINANCIAL STATEMENT PURPOSES, AS WELL AS THE INTEREST AND PENALTIES RELATED TO UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS. SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN THESE ESTIMATES MAY RESULT IN AN INCREASE OR DECREASE TO OUR TAX PROVISION IN A SUBSEQUENT PERIOD.

WE MUST ASSESS THE LIKELIHOOD THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO RECOVER OUR DEFERRED TAX ASSETS. IF RECOVERY IS NOT MORE LIKELY THAN NOT, WE MUST INCREASE OUR PROVISION FOR TAXES BY RECORDING A VALUATION ALLOWANCE AGAINST THE DEFERRED TAX ASSETS THAT WE ESTIMATE WILL NOT ULTIMATELY BE RECOVERABLE. WE BELIEVE THAT WE WILL ULTIMATELY RECOVER THE DEFERRED TAX ASSETS RECORDED ON OUR CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS. HOWEVER, SHOULD A CHANGE OCCUR IN OUR ABILITY TO RECOVER OUR DEFERRED TAX ASSETS, OUR TAX PROVISION WOULD INCREASE IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH WE DETERMINED THAT THE RECOVERY IS NOT MORE LIKELY THAN NOT. RECOVERY OF A PORTION OF OUR DEFERRED TAX ASSETS IS IMPACTED BY MANAGEMENT’S PLANS WITH RESPECT TO HOLDING OR DISPOSING OF CERTAIN INVESTMENTS; THEREFORE, CHANGES IN MANAGEMENT’S PLANS WITH RESPECT TO HOLDING OR DISPOSING OF INVESTMENTS COULD AFFECT OUR FUTURE PROVISION FOR TAXES.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)

WE RECOGNIZE LIABILITIES FOR UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS BASED ON A TWO-STEP PROCESS. THE FIRST STEP IS TO EVALUATE THE TAX POSITION FOR RECOGNITION BY DETERMINING WHETHER THE WEIGHT OF AVAILABLE EVIDENCE INDICATES THAT IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT THE POSITION WILL BE SUSTAINED ON AUDIT, INCLUDING RESOLUTION OF RELATED APPEALS OR LITIGATION PROCESSES, IF ANY. IF WE DETERMINE THAT A TAX POSITION WILL MORE LIKELY THAN NOT BE SUSTAINED ON AUDIT, THE SECOND STEP REQUIRES US TO ESTIMATE AND MEASURE THE TAX BENEFIT AS THE LARGEST AMOUNT THAT IS MORE THAN

50%

LIKELY TO BE REALIZED UPON ULTIMATE SETTLEMENT. WE CONSIDER MANY FACTORS WHEN EVALUATING AND ESTIMATING OUR TAX POSITIONS AND TAX BENEFITS, WHICH MAY REQUIRE PERIODIC ADJUSTMENTS AND MAY NOT ACCURATELY FORECAST ACTUAL OUTCOMES. DETERMINING WHETHER AN UNCERTAIN TAX POSITION IS EFFECTIVELY SETTLED REQUIRES JUDGMENT. SUCH A CHANGE IN RECOGNITION OR MEASUREMENT WOULD RESULT IN THE RECOGNITION OF A TAX BENEFIT OR AN ADDITIONAL CHARGE TO THE TAX PROVISION.

WE HAVE NOT RECOGNIZED U.S. DEFERRED INCOME TAXES ON CERTAIN UNDISTRIBUTED NON-U.S. EARNINGS BECAUSE WE PLAN TO INDEFINITELY REINVEST SUCH EARNINGS OUTSIDE THE U.S. REMITTANCES OF NON-U.S. EARNINGS ARE BASED ON ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS OF PROJECTED CASH FLOW NEEDS AS WELL AS THE WORKING CAPITAL AND INVESTMENT REQUIREMENTS OF OUR NON-U.S. AND U.S. OPERATIONS. MATERIAL CHANGES IN OUR ESTIMATES OF CASH, WORKING CAPITAL, AND INVESTMENT NEEDS IN THE VARIOUS JURISDICTIONS COULD REQUIRE REPATRIATION OF INDEFINITELY REINVESTED NON-U.S. EARNINGS, WHICH WOULD BE SUBJECT TO U.S. INCOME TAXES AND APPLICABLE NON-U.S. INCOME AND WITHHOLDING TAXES.

INVENTORY

INTEL HAS A PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT LIFECYCLE THAT CORRESPONDS WITH SUBSTANTIVE ENGINEERING MILESTONES. THESE ENGINEERING MILESTONES ARE REGULARLY AND CONSISTENTLY APPLIED IN ASSESSING THE POINT AT WHICH OUR ACTIVITIES, AND ASSOCIATED COSTS, CHANGE IN NATURE FROM R&D TO COST OF SALES. IN ORDER FOR A PRODUCT TO BE MANUFACTURED IN HIGH VOLUMES AND SOLD TO OUR CUSTOMERS UNDER OUR STANDARD WARRANTY, IT MUST MEET OUR RIGOROUS TECHNICAL QUALITY SPECIFICATIONS. THIS MILESTONE IS KNOWN AS PRODUCT RELEASE QUALIFICATION (PRQ). WE HAVE IDENTIFIED PRQ AS THE POINT AT WHICH THE COSTS INCURRED TO MANUFACTURE OUR PRODUCTS ARE INCLUDED IN THE VALUATION OF INVENTORY.

TO DETERMINE WHICH COSTS CAN BE INCLUDED IN THE VALUATION OF INVENTORY, WE MUST DETERMINE NORMAL CAPACITY AT OUR MANUFACTURING AND ASSEMBLY AND TEST FACILITIES, BASED ON HISTORICAL LOADINGS COMPARED TO TOTAL AVAILABLE CAPACITY. IF THE FACTORY LOADINGS ARE BELOW THE ESTABLISHED NORMAL CAPACITY LEVEL, A PORTION OF OUR MANUFACTURING OVERHEAD COSTS WOULD NOT BE INCLUDED IN THE COST OF INVENTORY; THEREFORE, IT WOULD BE RECOGNIZED AS COST OF SALES IN THAT PERIOD, WHICH WOULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR GROSS MARGIN. WE REFER TO THESE COSTS AS EXCESS CAPACITY CHARGES. EXCESS CAPACITY CHARGES WERE

ZERO

IN

2014

(

$319 MILLION

IN

2013

AND

$540 MILLION

IN

2012

).

INVENTORY IS VALUED AT THE LOWER OF COST OR MARKET BASED UPON ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT FUTURE DEMAND AND MARKET CONDITIONS. PRODUCT-SPECIFIC FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES REVIEWED IN THE INVENTORY VALUATION PROCESS INCLUDE A REVIEW OF OUR CUSTOMER BASE, THE STAGE OF THE PRODUCT LIFE CYCLE OF OUR PRODUCTS, CONSUMER CONFIDENCE, CUSTOMER ACCEPTANCE OF OUR PRODUCTS, AND AN ASSESSMENT OF SELLING PRICE IN RELATION TO PRODUCT COST. IF THE ESTIMATED MARKET VALUE OF THE INVENTORY IS LESS THAN THE CARRYING VALUE, WE WRITE DOWN THE INVENTORY AND RECORD THE DIFFERENCE AS A CHARGE TO COST OF SALES. INVENTORY RESERVES INCREASED BY APPROXIMATELY

$290 MILLION

IN

2014

COMPARED TO

2013

. THIS INCREASE WAS DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY HIGHER PRODUCTION COSTS ON 14NM TREATED AS PERIOD CHARGES AND PRE-QUALIFICATION PRODUCT COSTS. THESE INCREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE SELL-THROUGH OF WRITTEN-DOWN INVENTORY AND PREVIOUSLY NON-QUALIFIED UNITS.

THE VALUATION OF INVENTORY ALSO REQUIRES US TO ESTIMATE OBSOLETE AND EXCESS INVENTORY AS WELL AS INVENTORY THAT IS NOT OF SALEABLE QUALITY. THE DEMAND FORECAST IS UTILIZED IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF OUR SHORT-TERM MANUFACTURING PLANS TO ENABLE CONSISTENCY BETWEEN INVENTORY VALUATION AND BUILD DECISIONS. THE ESTIMATE OF FUTURE DEMAND IS COMPARED TO WORK-IN-PROCESS AND FINISHED GOODS INVENTORY LEVELS TO DETERMINE THE AMOUNT, IF ANY, OF OBSOLETE OR EXCESS INVENTORY. IF OUR DEMAND FORECAST FOR SPECIFIC PRODUCTS IS GREATER THAN ACTUAL DEMAND AND WE FAIL TO REDUCE MANUFACTURING OUTPUT ACCORDINGLY, WE COULD BE REQUIRED TO WRITE OFF INVENTORY, WHICH WOULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR GROSS MARGIN.

LOSS CONTINGENCIES

WE ARE SUBJECT TO LOSS CONTINGENCIES, INCLUDING VARIOUS LEGAL AND REGULATORY PROCEEDINGS AND ASSERTED AND POTENTIAL CLAIMS, ACCRUALS RELATED TO REPAIR OR REPLACEMENT OF PARTS IN CONNECTION WITH PRODUCT ERRATA, AS WELL AS PRODUCT WARRANTIES AND POTENTIAL ASSET IMPAIRMENTS THAT ARISE IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS. AN ESTIMATED LOSS FROM SUCH CONTINGENCIES IS RECOGNIZED AS A CHARGE TO INCOME IF IT IS PROBABLE THAT A LIABILITY HAS BEEN INCURRED AND THE AMOUNT OF THE LOSS CAN BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED. DISCLOSURE OF A LOSS CONTINGENCY IS REQUIRED IF THERE IS AT LEAST A REASONABLE POSSIBILITY THAT A MATERIAL LOSS HAS BEEN INCURRED. THE OUTCOMES OF LEGAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDINGS AND CLAIMS, AND THE ESTIMATION OF PRODUCT WARRANTIES AND ASSET IMPAIRMENTS, ARE SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT UNCERTAINTY. SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT IS REQUIRED IN BOTH THE DETERMINATION OF PROBABILITY AND THE DETERMINATION AS TO WHETHER A LOSS IS REASONABLY ESTIMABLE. AT LEAST QUARTERLY, WE REVIEW THE STATUS OF EACH SIGNIFICANT MATTER, AND WE MAY REVISE OUR ESTIMATES. THESE REVISIONS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL POSITION.

INVESTING ACTIVITIES

INVESTING CASH FLOWS CONSIST PRIMARILY OF CAPITAL EXPENDITURES; INVESTMENT PURCHASES, SALES, MATURITIES, AND DISPOSALS; AS WELL AS PROCEEDS FROM DIVESTITURES AND CASH USED FOR ACQUISITIONS.

THE

DECREASE

IN CASH USED FOR INVESTING ACTIVITIES IN

2014

COMPARED TO

2013

WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO A DECREASE IN PURCHASES OF AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE INVESTMENTS AND TRADING ASSETS,HIGHER MATURITIES, AND SALES OF OUR AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE INVESTMENTS. THIS ACTIVITY WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN INVESTMENTS IN NON-MARKETABLE EQUITY INVESTMENTS AND LOWER MATURITIES AND SALES OF TRADING ASSETS. OUR CAPITAL EXPENDITURES WERE

PRIMARILY DUE TO AN INCREASE IN PURCHASES OF AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE INVESTMENTS AND A DECREASE IN MATURITIES AND SALES OF TRADING ASSETS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN MATURITIES AND SALES OF AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE INVESTMENTS AND A DECREASE IN PURCHASES OF LICENSED TECHNOLOGY AND PATENTS. NET PURCHASES OF AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE INVESTMENTS IN 2012 INCLUDED OUR PURCHASE OF

$3.2 BILLION

FINANCING ACTIVITIES

FINANCING CASH FLOWS CONSIST PRIMARILY OF REPURCHASES OF COMMON STOCK, PAYMENT OF DIVIDENDS TO STOCKHOLDERS, ISSUANCE AND REPAYMENT OF LONG-TERM DEBT, AND PROCEEDS FROM THE SALE OF COMMON STOCK THROUGH EMPLOYEE EQUITY INCENTIVE PLANS.

THE

TABLE OF CONTENTS

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)

THE INCREASE IN CASH USED FOR FINANCING ACTIVITIES IN

COMPARED TO

WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE ISSUANCE OF LONG-TERM DEBT IN 2012 AND FEWER REPURCHASES OF COMMON STOCK UNDER OUR AUTHORIZED COMMON STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM IN 2013.

LIQUIDITY

CASH GENERATED BY OPERATIONS IS OUR PRIMARY SOURCE OF LIQUIDITY. WE MAINTAIN A DIVERSE INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO THAT WE CONTINUALLY ANALYZE BASED ON ISSUER, INDUSTRY, AND COUNTRY. AS OF

MOST

OF OUR INVESTMENTS IN DEBT INSTRUMENTS ARE IN

RATED ISSUANCES, AND

THE MAJORITY

OF THE ISSUANCES ARE RATED

AA-/AA3 OR BETTER.

ANOTHER POTENTIAL SOURCE OF LIQUIDITY IS AN ONGOING AUTHORIZATION FROM OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS TO BORROW UP TO

$2.4 BILLION

DURING

$12.0 BILLION

OF OUR CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS, SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS, AND TRADING ASSETS WAS HELD BY OUR NON-U.S. SUBSIDIARIES. OF THE

$12.0 BILLION

HELD BY OUR NON-U.S. SUBSIDIARIES, APPROXIMATELY

$2.3 BILLION

WAS AVAILABLE FOR USE IN THE U.S. WITHOUT INCURRING ADDITIONAL U.S. INCOME TAXES IN EXCESS OF THE AMOUNTS ALREADY ACCRUED IN OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AS OF

DECEMBER 27, 2014

. THE REMAINING AMOUNT OF NON-U.S. CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS, SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS, AND TRADING ASSETS HAS BEEN INDEFINITELY REINVESTED AND, THEREFORE, NO U.S. CURRENT OR DEFERRED TAXES HAVE BEEN ACCRUED AND THIS AMOUNT IS EARMARKED FOR NEAR-TERM INVESTMENT IN OUR OPERATIONS OUTSIDE THE U.S. AND FUTURE ACQUISITIONS OF NON-U.S. ENTITIES. WE BELIEVE OUR U.S. SOURCES OF CASH AND LIQUIDITY ARE SUFFICIENT TO MEET OUR BUSINESS NEEDS IN THE U.S., AND DO NOT EXPECT THAT WE WILL NEED TO REPATRIATE THE FUNDS WE HAVE DESIGNATED AS INDEFINITELY REINVESTED OUTSIDE THE U.S. UNDER CURRENT TAX LAWS, SHOULD OUR PLANS CHANGE AND WE WERE TO CHOOSE TO REPATRIATE SOME OR ALL OF THE FUNDS WE HAVE DESIGNATED AS INDEFINITELY REINVESTED OUTSIDE THE U.S., SUCH AMOUNTS WOULD BE SUBJECT TO U.S. INCOME TAXES AND APPLICABLE NON-U.S. INCOME AND WITHHOLDING TAXES.

WE BELIEVE WE HAVE SUFFICIENT FINANCIAL RESOURCES TO MEET OUR BUSINESS REQUIREMENTS IN THE NEXT 12 MONTHS, INCLUDING CAPITAL EXPENDITURES FOR WORLDWIDE MANUFACTURING AND ASSEMBLY AND TEST, WORKING CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS, DIVIDENDS, COMMON STOCK REPURCHASES, ACQUISITIONS, AND STRATEGIC INVESTMENTS.

MARKETABLE DEBT INSTRUMENTS

AS OF

DECEMBER 27, 2014

$15.0 BILLION

OF MARKETABLE DEBT INSTRUMENTS. OF THESE INSTRUMENTS,

$6.9 BILLION

WAS CLASSIFIED AS LEVEL 1,

$8.0 BILLION

AS LEVEL 2, AND

$106 MILLION

AS LEVEL 3.

OUR MARKETABLE DEBT INSTRUMENTS THAT ARE MEASURED AND RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE ON A RECURRING BASIS AND CLASSIFIED AS LEVEL 1 WERE CLASSIFIED AS SUCH DUE TO THE USE OF OBSERVABLE MARKET PRICES FOR IDENTICAL SECURITIES THAT ARE TRADED IN ACTIVE MARKETS. WE EVALUATE SECURITY-SPECIFIC MARKET DATA WHEN DETERMINING WHETHER THE MARKET FOR A DEBT SECURITY IS ACTIVE.

OF THE

$8.0 BILLION

OF MARKETABLE DEBT INSTRUMENTS MEASURED AND RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE ON A RECURRING BASIS AND CLASSIFIED AS LEVEL 2, APPROXIMATELY

40%

WAS CLASSIFIED AS LEVEL 2 DUE TO THE USE OF A DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW MODEL PERFORMED BY US AND APPROXIMATELY

60%

WAS CLASSIFIED AS SUCH DUE TO THE USE OF NON-BINDING MARKET CONSENSUS PRICES THAT WERE CORROBORATED WITH OBSERVABLE MARKET DATA.

OUR MARKETABLE DEBT INSTRUMENTS THAT ARE MEASURED AND RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE ON A RECURRING BASIS AND CLASSIFIED AS LEVEL 3 ARE CLASSIFIED AS SUCH BECAUSE THE FAIR VALUES

ARE GENERALLY DERIVED FROM DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW MODELS, PERFORMED EITHER BY US OR OUR PRICING PROVIDERS, USING INPUTS THAT WE ARE UNABLE TO CORROBORATE WITH OBSERVABLE MARKET DATA. WE MONITOR AND REVIEW THE INPUTS AND RESULTS OF THESE VALUATION MODELS TO HELP ENSURE THE FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS ARE REASONABLE AND CONSISTENT WITH MARKET EXPERIENCE IN SIMILAR ASSET CLASSES.

$721 MILLION

OF LOANS RECEIVABLE AND

$268 MILLION

OF REVERSE REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS. ALL OF THESE INVESTMENTS WERE CLASSIFIED AS LEVEL 2, AS THE FAIR VALUE IS DETERMINED USING A DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW MODEL WITH ALL SIGNIFICANT INPUTS DERIVED FROM OR CORROBORATED WITH OBSERVABLE MARKET DATA.

MARKETABLE EQUITY SECURITIES

DECEMBER 27, 2014

, OUR ASSETS MEASURED AND RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE ON A RECURRING BASIS INCLUDED

$7.1 BILLION

OF MARKETABLE EQUITY SECURITIES. ALL OF THESE SECURITIES WERE CLASSIFIED AS LEVEL 1 BECAUSE THE VALUATIONS WERE BASED ON QUOTED PRICES FOR IDENTICAL SECURITIES IN ACTIVE MARKETS. OUR ASSESSMENT OF AN ACTIVE MARKET FOR OUR MARKETABLE EQUITY SECURITIES GENERALLY TAKES INTO CONSIDERATION THE NUMBER OF DAYS THAT EACH INDIVIDUAL EQUITY SECURITY TRADES OVER A SPECIFIED PERIOD.

, AS WE HAD NOT YET RECEIVED THE RELATED GOODS OR TAKEN TITLE TO THE PROPERTY.

2

OTHER PURCHASE OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS INCLUDE PAYMENTS DUE UNDER VARIOUS TYPES OF LICENSES AND AGREEMENTS TO PURCHASE GOODS OR SERVICES, AS WELL AS PAYMENTS DUE UNDER NON-CONTINGENT FUNDING OBLIGATIONS. FUNDING OBLIGATIONS INCLUDE AGREEMENTS TO FUND VARIOUS PROJECTS WITH OTHER COMPANIES.

3

AMOUNTS REPRESENT PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST CASH PAYMENTS OVER THE LIFE OF THE DEBT OBLIGATIONS, INCLUDING ANTICIPATED INTEREST PAYMENTS THAT ARE NOT RECORDED ON OUR CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS. DEBT OBLIGATIONS ARE

CLASSIFIED BASED ON THEIR STATED MATURITY DATE, REGARDLESS OF THEIR CLASSIFICATION ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET

S. ANY FUTURE SETTLEMENT OF CONVERTIBLE DEBT WOULD IMPACT OUR CASH PAYMENTS.

WE ARE UNABLE TO RELIABLY ESTIMATE THE TIMING OF FUTURE PAYMENTS RELATED TO UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS; THEREFORE,

$262 MILLION

OF LONG-TERM INCOME TAXES PAYABLE HAS BEEN EXCLUDED FROM THE PRECEDING TABLE. HOWEVER, LONG-TERM INCOME TAXES PAYABLE, RECORDED ON OUR CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS, INCLUDED THESE UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS, REDUCED BY THE ASSOCIATED FEDERAL DEDUCTION FOR STATE TAXES AND U.S. TAX CREDITS ARISING FROM NON-U.S. INCOME TAXES.

5

AMOUNTS REPRESENT FUTURE CASH PAYMENTS TO SATISFY OTHER LONG-TERM LIABILITIES RECORDED ON OUR CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS, INCLUDING THE SHORT-TERM PORTION OF THESE LONG-TERM LIABILITIES. EXPECTED REQUIRED CONTRIBUTIONS TO OUR U.S. AND NON-U.S. PENSION PLANS AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS OF

$69 MILLION

TO BE MADE DURING

2015

ARE ALSO INCLUDED; HOWEVER, FUNDING PROJECTIONS BEYOND

2015

ARE NOT PRACTICABLE TO ESTIMATE.

TOTAL EXCLUDES CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS ALREADY RECORDED ON OUR CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS AS CURRENT LIABILITIES EXCEPT FOR THE SHORT-TERM PORTIONS OF LONG-TERM DEBT OBLIGATIONS AND OTHER LONG-TERM LIABILITIES.

THE EXPECTED TIMING OF PAYMENTS OF THE OBLIGATIONS IN THE PRECEDING TABLE IS ESTIMATED BASED ON CURRENT INFORMATION. TIMING OF PAYMENTS AND ACTUAL AMOUNTS PAID MAY BE DIFFERENT, DEPENDING ON THE TIME OF RECEIPT OF GOODS OR SERVICES, OR CHANGES TO AGREED-UPON AMOUNTS FOR SOME OBLIGATIONS.

CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS FOR PURCHASES OF GOODS OR SERVICES, INCLUDED IN OTHER PURCHASE OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS IN THE PRECEDING TABLE, INCLUDE AGREEMENTS THAT ARE ENFORCEABLE AND LEGALLY BINDING ON INTEL AND THAT SPECIFY ALL SIGNIFICANT TERMS, INCLUDING FIXED OR MINIMUM QUANTITIES TO BE PURCHASED; FIXED, MINIMUM, OR VARIABLE PRICE PROVISIONS; AND THE APPROXIMATE TIMING OF THE TRANSACTION. FOR OBLIGATIONS WITH CANCELLATION PROVISIONS, THE AMOUNTS INCLUDED IN THE PRECEDING TABLE WERE LIMITED TO THE NON-CANCELABLE PORTION OF THE AGREEMENT TERMS OR THE MINIMUM CANCELLATION FEE.

WE HAVE ENTERED INTO CERTAIN AGREEMENTS FOR THE PURCHASE OF RAW MATERIALS THAT SPECIFY MINIMUM PRICES AND QUANTITIES BASED ON A PERCENTAGE OF THE TOTAL AVAILABLE MARKET OR BASED ON A PERCENTAGE OF OUR FUTURE PURCHASING REQUIREMENTS. DUE TO THE UNCERTAINTY OF THE FUTURE MARKET AND OUR FUTURE PURCHASING REQUIREMENTS, AS WELL AS THE NON-BINDING NATURE OF THESE AGREEMENTS, OBLIGATIONS UNDER THESE AGREEMENTS HAVE BEEN EXCLUDED FROM THE PRECEDING TABLE. OUR PURCHASE ORDERS FOR OTHER PRODUCTS ARE BASED ON OUR CURRENT MANUFACTURING NEEDS AND ARE FULFILLED BY OUR VENDORS WITHIN SHORT TIME HORIZONS. IN ADDITION, SOME OF OUR PURCHASE ORDERS REPRESENT AUTHORIZATIONS TO PURCHASE RATHER THAN BINDING AGREEMENTS.

CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS THAT ARE CONTINGENT UPON THE ACHIEVEMENT OF CERTAIN MILESTONES HAVE BEEN EXCLUDED FROM THE PRECEDING TABLE. THESE OBLIGATIONS INCLUDE MILESTONE-BASED CO-MARKETING AGREEMENTS, CONTINGENT FUNDING OR PAYMENT OBLIGATIONS, AND MILESTONE-BASED EQUITY INVESTMENT FUNDING. THESE ARRANGEMENTS ARE NOT CONSIDERED CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS UNTIL THE MILESTONE IS MET BY THE THIRD PARTY. AS OF

DECEMBER 27, 2014

, ASSUMING THAT ALL FUTURE MILESTONES ARE MET, EXCLUDING THE ASML MILESTONES SUBSEQUENTLY MENTIONED, THE ADDITIONAL REQUIRED PAYMENTS WOULD BE APPROXIMATELY

$450 MILLION.

DURING 2012, WE ENTERED INTO A SERIES OF AGREEMENTS WITH ASML INTENDED TO ACCELERATE THE DEVELOPMENT OF

EUV LITHOGRAPHY, CERTAIN OF WHICH WERE AMENDED IN 2014. UNDER THE AMENDED AGREEMENTS

INTEL AGREED TO PROVIDE R&D FUNDING TOTALING

€829 MILLION

OVER FIVE YEARS AND COMMITTED TO ADVANCE PURCHASE ORDERS FOR A SPECIFIED NUMBER OF TOOLS FROM ASML.

OUR REMAINING OBLIGATION, CONTINGENT UPON ASML ACHIEVING CERTAIN MILESTONES, IS APPROXIMATELY

€562 MILLION

, OR

$689 MILLION

, AS OF

DECEMBER 27, 2014

. AS OUR OBLIGATION IS CONTINGENT UPON ASML ACHIEVING CERTAIN MILESTONES, WE HAVE EXCLUDED THIS OBLIGATION FROM

THE PRECEDING TABLE.

FOR THE MAJORITY OF RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS GRANTED, THE NUMBER OF SHARES OF COMMON STOCK ISSUED ON THE DATE THE RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS VEST IS NET OF THE MINIMUM STATUTORY WITHHOLDING REQUIREMENTS THAT WE PAY IN CASH TO THE APPROPRIATE TAXING AUTHORITIES ON BEHALF OF OUR EMPLOYEES.

THE OBLIGATION TO PAY THE RELEVANT TAXING AUTHORITY IS EXCLUDED FROM THE PRECEDING TABLE, AS THE AMOUNT IS CONTINGENT UPON CONTINUED EMPLOYMENT. IN ADDITION, THE AMOUNT OF THE OBLIGATION IS UNKNOWN, AS IT IS BASED IN PART ON THE MARKET PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK WHEN THE AWARDS VEST.

DURING 2014, WE ENTERED INTO A SERIES OF AGREEMENTS WITH TSINGHUA UNIGROUP LTD. (TSINGHUA UNIGROUP), AN OPERATING SUBSIDIARY OF TSINGHUA HOLDINGS CO. LTD., TO, AMONG OTHER THINGS, JOINTLY DEVELOP INTEL ARCHITECTURE- AND COMMUNICATIONS-BASED SOLUTIONS FOR SMARTPHONES. SUBJECT TO REGULATORY APPROVALS AND OTHER CLOSING CONDITIONS, WE HAVE ALSO AGREED TO INVEST UP TO RMB

9.0 BILLION

(APPROXIMATELY

$1.5 BILLION

AS OF THE DATE OF THE AGREEMENT) FOR A MINORITY STAKE OF APPROXIMATELY

20%

OF THE HOLDING COMPANY UNDER TSINGHUA UNIGROUP, WHICH WILL OWN SPREADTRUM COMMUNICATIONS AND RDA MICROELECTRONICS. AS OUR OBLIGATION IS CONTINGENT UPON REGULATORY APPROVALS AND OTHER CLOSING CONDITIONS, IT HAS BEEN EXCLUDED FROM THE PRECEDING TABLE.

OFF-BALANCE-SHEET ARRANGEMENTS

TABLE OF CONTENTS

ITEM 7A.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

WE ARE AFFECTED BY CHANGES IN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES, INTEREST RATES, AND EQUITY PRICES. ALL OF THE FOLLOWING POTENTIAL CHANGES ARE BASED ON SENSITIVITY ANALYSES PERFORMED ON OUR FINANCIAL POSITIONS AS OF

DECEMBER 27, 2014

, AND

DECEMBER 28, 2013

. ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER MATERIALLY.

CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES

IN GENERAL, WE ECONOMICALLY HEDGE CURRENCY RISKS OF NON-U.S.-DOLLAR-DENOMINATED INVESTMENTS IN DEBT INSTRUMENTS AND LOANS RECEIVABLE WITH CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS OR CURRENCY INTEREST RATE SWAPS. GAINS AND LOSSES ON THESE NON-U.S.-CURRENCY INVESTMENTS ARE GENERALLY OFFSET BY CORRESPONDING GAINS AND LOSSES ON THE RELATED HEDGING INSTRUMENTS.

SUBSTANTIALLY ALL

OF OUR REVENUE IS TRANSACTED IN U.S. DOLLARS. HOWEVER, A

SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT

OF OUR OPERATING EXPENDITURES AND CAPITAL PURCHASES ARE INCURRED IN OR EXPOSED TO OTHER CURRENCIES,

PRIMARILY THE EURO, THE JAPANESE YEN, THE CHINESE YUAN, AND THE ISRAELI SHEKEL

. WE HAVE ESTABLISHED BALANCE SHEET AND FORECASTED TRANSACTION CURRENCY RISK MANAGEMENT PROGRAMS TO PROTECT AGAINST FLUCTUATIONS IN THE FAIR VALUE AND THE VOLATILITY OF THE FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY EQUIVALENT OF FUTURE CASH FLOWS CAUSED BY CHANGES IN EXCHANGE RATES. WE GENERALLY UTILIZE CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS IN THESE HEDGING PROGRAMS.

THESE PROGRAMS REDUCE, BUT DO NOT ELIMINATE, THE IMPACT OF CURRENCY EXCHANGE MOVEMENTS

. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION, SEE "RISK FACTORS" IN PART I, ITEM 1A OF THIS FORM 10-K. WE CONSIDERED THE HISTORICAL TRENDS IN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES AND DETERMINED THAT IT WAS REASONABLY POSSIBLE THAT A WEIGHTED AVERAGE ADVERSE CHANGE OF

20%

IN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES COULD BE EXPERIENCED IN THE NEAR TERM. SUCH AN ADVERSE CHANGE, AFTER TAKING INTO ACCOUNT BALANCE SHEET HEDGES ONLY AND OFFSETTING RECORDED MONETARY ASSET AND LIABILITY POSITIONS, WOULD HAVE RESULTED IN AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON INCOME BEFORE TAXES OF LESS THAN

$50 MILLION

AS OF

DECEMBER 27, 2014

(LESS THAN

$40 MILLION

AS OF

DECEMBER 28, 2013

).

INTEREST RATES

WE GENERALLY HEDGE INTEREST RATE RISKS OF FIXED-RATE DEBT INSTRUMENTS WITH INTEREST RATE SWAPS. GAINS AND LOSSES ON THESE INVESTMENTS ARE GENERALLY OFFSET BY CORRESPONDING LOSSES AND GAINS ON THE RELATED HEDGING INSTRUMENTS.

WE ARE EXPOSED TO INTEREST RATE RISK RELATED TO OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO AND INDEBTEDNESS. OUR INDEBTEDNESS INCLUDES OUR DEBT ISSUANCES AND THE LIABILITY ASSOCIATED WITH A LONG-TERM PATENT CROSS-LICENSE AGREEMENT WITH NVIDIA CORPORATION. THE PRIMARY OBJECTIVE OF OUR INVESTMENTS IN DEBT INSTRUMENTS IS TO PRESERVE PRINCIPAL WHILE MAXIMIZING YIELDS, WHICH GENERALLY TRACK THE U.S. DOLLAR THREE-MONTH LIBOR. A HYPOTHETICAL DECREASE IN INTEREST RATES OF UP TO

1.0%

WOULD HAVE RESULTED IN AN INCREASE IN THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR INDEBTEDNESS OF APPROXIMATELY

$1.0 BILLION

AS OF

DECEMBER 27, 2014

(AN INCREASE OF APPROXIMATELY

$1.1 BILLION

AS OF

DECEMBER 28, 2013

). A HYPOTHETICAL DECREASE IN BENCHMARK INTEREST RATES OF UP TO

1.0%

, AFTER TAKING INTO ACCOUNT INVESTMENT HEDGES, WOULD HAVE RESULTED IN AN INCREASE IN THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO OF APPROXIMATELY

$10 MILLION

AS OF

DECEMBER 27, 2014

(AN INCREASE OF APPROXIMATELY

$10 MILLION

AS OF

DECEMBER 28, 2013

). THE FLUCTUATIONS IN FAIR VALUE OF OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO AND INDEBTEDNESS REFLECT ONLY THE DIRECT IMPACT OF THE CHANGE IN INTEREST RATES. OTHER ECONOMIC VARIABLES, SUCH AS EQUITY MARKET FLUCTUATIONS AND CHANGES IN RELATIVE CREDIT RISK, COULD RESULT IN A SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER DECLINE IN THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR NET INVESTMENT POSITION. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ON HOW CREDIT RISK IS FACTORED INTO THE VALUATION OF OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO AND DEBT ISSUANCES, SEE "

NOTE 4: FAIR VALUE

" IN PART II, ITEM 8 OF THIS FORM 10-K.

EQUITY PRICES

OUR INVESTMENTS INCLUDE MARKETABLE EQUITY SECURITIES AND EQUITY DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS. WE TYPICALLY DO NOT ATTEMPT TO REDUCE OR ELIMINATE OUR EQUITY MARKET EXPOSURE THROUGH HEDGING ACTIVITIES AT THE INCEPTION OF OUR INVESTMENTS. BEFORE WE ENTER INTO HEDGE ARRANGEMENTS, WE EVALUATE LEGAL, MARKET, AND ECONOMIC FACTORS, AS WELL AS THE EXPECTED TIMING OF DISPOSAL, TO DETERMINE WHETHER HEDGING IS APPROPRIATE. OUR EQUITY MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT PROGRAM MAY INCLUDE EQUITY DERIVATIVES WITH OR WITHOUT HEDGE ACCOUNTING DESIGNATION THAT UTILIZE WARRANTS, EQUITY OPTIONS, OR OTHER EQUITY DERIVATIVES.

WE ALSO UTILIZE TOTAL RETURN SWAPS TO OFFSET CHANGES IN LIABILITIES RELATED TO THE EQUITY MARKET RISKS OF CERTAIN DEFERRED COMPENSATION ARRANGEMENTS. GAINS AND LOSSES FROM CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THESE TOTAL RETURN SWAPS ARE GENERALLY OFFSET BY THE LOSSES AND GAINS ON THE RELATED LIABILITIES.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

AS OF

DECEMBER 27, 2014

, THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR MARKETABLE EQUITY INVESTMENTS AND OUR EQUITY DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS, INCLUDING HEDGING POSITIONS, WAS

$7.1 BILLION

(

$6.3 BILLION

AS OF

DECEMBER 28, 2013

).

SUBSTANTIALLY ALL

OF OUR MARKETABLE EQUITY INVESTMENTS PORTFOLIO AS OF

DECEMBER 27, 2014

WAS CONCENTRATED IN OUR INVESTMENT IN ASML OF

$6.9 BILLION

(

$5.9 BILLION

AS OF

DECEMBER 28, 2013

). OUR MARKETABLE EQUITY METHOD INVESTMENTS ARE EXCLUDED FROM OUR ANALYSIS, AS THE CARRYING VALUE DOES NOT FLUCTUATE BASED ON MARKET PRICE CHANGES UNLESS AN OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENT IS DEEMED NECESSARY. TO DETERMINE REASONABLY POSSIBLE DECREASES IN THE MARKET VALUE OF OUR MARKETABLE EQUITY INVESTMENTS, WE HAVE ANALYZED THE HISTORICAL MARKET PRICE SENSITIVITY OF OUR MARKETABLE EQUITY INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO. ASSUMING A DECLINE OF

30%

IN MARKET PRICES, AND AFTER REFLECTING THE IMPACT OF HEDGES AND OFFSETTING POSITIONS, THE AGGREGATE VALUE OF OUR MARKETABLE EQUITY INVESTMENTS COULD DECREASE BY APPROXIMATELY

$2.1 BILLION

, BASED ON THE VALUE AS OF

DECEMBER 27, 2014

(A DECREASE IN VALUE OF APPROXIMATELY

$1.6 BILLION

, BASED ON THE VALUE AS OF

DECEMBER 28, 2013

USING AN ASSUMED DECLINE OF

25%

).

MANY OF THE SAME FACTORS THAT COULD RESULT IN AN ADVERSE MOVEMENT OF EQUITY MARKET PRICES AFFECT OUR NON-MARKETABLE EQUITY INVESTMENTS, ALTHOUGH WE CANNOT ALWAYS QUANTIFY THE IMPACT DIRECTLY. FINANCIAL MARKETS ARE VOLATILE, WHICH COULD NEGATIVELY AFFECT THE PROSPECTS OF THE COMPANIES WE INVEST IN, THEIR ABILITY TO RAISE ADDITIONAL CAPITAL, AND THE LIKELIHOOD OF OUR ABILITY TO REALIZE VALUE IN OUR INVESTMENTS THROUGH LIQUIDITY EVENTS SUCH AS INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERINGS, MERGERS, AND PRIVATE SALES. THESE TYPES OF INVESTMENTS INVOLVE A GREAT DEAL OF RISK, AND THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT ANY SPECIFIC COMPANY WILL GROW OR BECOME SUCCESSFUL; CONSEQUENTLY, WE COULD LOSE ALL OR PART OF OUR INVESTMENT. OUR NON-MARKETABLE EQUITY INVESTMENTS, EXCLUDING INVESTMENTS ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER THE EQUITY METHOD, HAD A CARRYING AMOUNT OF

$1.8 BILLION

AS OF

DECEMBER 27, 2014

(

$1.3 BILLION

AS OF

DECEMBER 28, 2013

). THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF OUR NON-MARKETABLE EQUITY METHOD INVESTMENTS WAS

$1.4 BILLION

AS OF

DECEMBER 27, 2014

(

$1.0 BILLION

AS OF

DECEMBER 28, 2013

). THE MAJORITY OF OUR NON-MARKETABLE EQUITY METHOD INVESTMENTS BALANCE AS OF

DECEMBER 27, 2014

WAS CONCENTRATED IN OUR IMFT AND CLOUDERA (WHICH WAS PURCHASED DURING

2014

) INVESTMENTS OF

$713 MILLION

AND

$280 MILLION

, RESPECTIVELY (

$646 MILLION

FOR IMFT AS OF

DECEMBER 28, 2013

).

COMMODITY PRICE RISK

ALTHOUGH WE OPERATE FACILITIES THAT CONSUME COMMODITIES, WE ARE NOT MATERIALLY AFFECTED BY COMMODITY PRICE RISK. WE HAVE ESTABLISHED FORECASTED TRANSACTION RISK MANAGEMENT PROGRAMS TO PROTECT AGAINST FLUCTUATIONS IN THE FAIR VALUE AND THE VOLATILITY OF FUTURE CASH FLOWS CAUSED BY CHANGES IN COMMODITY PRICES. IN ADDITION, WE HAVE SOURCING PLANS IN PLACE FOR OUR KEY COMMODITIES THAT MITIGATE THE RISK OF A POTENTIAL SUPPLIER CONCENTRATION. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ON COMMODITY PRICE RISK, SEE "

. OUR AUDITS ALSO INCLUDED THE FINANCIAL STATEMENT SCHEDULE LISTED IN THE INDEX AT PART IV, ITEM 15. THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SCHEDULE ARE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE COMPANY'S MANAGEMENT. OUR RESPONSIBILITY IS TO EXPRESS AN OPINION ON THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SCHEDULE BASED ON OUR AUDITS.

WE CONDUCTED OUR AUDITS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE STANDARDS OF THE PUBLIC COMPANY ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BOARD (UNITED STATES). THOSE STANDARDS REQUIRE THAT WE PLAN AND PERFORM THE AUDIT TO OBTAIN REASONABLE ASSURANCE ABOUT WHETHER THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE FREE OF MATERIAL MISSTATEMENT. AN AUDIT INCLUDES EXAMINING, ON A TEST BASIS, EVIDENCE SUPPORTING THE AMOUNTS AND DISCLOSURES IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. AN AUDIT ALSO INCLUDES ASSESSING THE ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES USED AND SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES MADE BY MANAGEMENT, AS WELL AS EVALUATING THE OVERALL FINANCIAL STATEMENT PRESENTATION. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR AUDITS PROVIDE A REASONABLE BASIS FOR OUR OPINION.

IN OUR OPINION, THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS REFERRED TO ABOVE PRESENT FAIRLY, IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS, THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL POSITION OF INTEL CORPORATION AT

DECEMBER 27, 2014

AND

DECEMBER 28, 2013

, AND THE CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF ITS OPERATIONS AND ITS CASH FLOWS FOR EACH OF THE THREE YEARS IN THE PERIOD ENDED

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND STOCKHOLDERS OF INTEL CORPORATION

WE HAVE AUDITED INTEL CORPORATION’S INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF

DECEMBER 27, 2014

, BASED ON CRITERIA ESTABLISHED IN INTERNAL CONTROL—INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK ISSUED BY THE COMMITTEE OF SPONSORING ORGANIZATIONS OF THE TREADWAY COMMISSION (

2013 FRAMEWORK

) (THE COSO CRITERIA). INTEL CORPORATION’S MANAGEMENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR MAINTAINING EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, AND FOR ITS ASSESSMENT OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING INCLUDED IN THE ACCOMPANYING MANAGEMENT REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING. OUR RESPONSIBILITY IS TO EXPRESS AN OPINION ON THE COMPANY’S INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING BASED ON OUR AUDIT.

WE CONDUCTED OUR AUDIT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE STANDARDS OF THE PUBLIC COMPANY ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BOARD (UNITED STATES). THOSE STANDARDS REQUIRE THAT WE PLAN AND PERFORM THE AUDIT TO OBTAIN REASONABLE ASSURANCE ABOUT WHETHER EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING WAS MAINTAINED IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS. OUR AUDIT INCLUDED OBTAINING AN UNDERSTANDING OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, ASSESSING THE RISK THAT A MATERIAL WEAKNESS EXISTS, TESTING AND EVALUATING THE DESIGN AND OPERATING EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL CONTROL BASED ON THE ASSESSED RISK, AND PERFORMING SUCH OTHER PROCEDURES AS WE CONSIDERED NECESSARY IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR AUDIT PROVIDES A REASONABLE BASIS FOR OUR OPINION.

A COMPANY’S INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING IS A PROCESS DESIGNED TO PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING THE RELIABILITY OF FINANCIAL REPORTING AND THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR EXTERNAL PURPOSES IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES. A COMPANY’S INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING INCLUDES THOSE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES THAT (1) PERTAIN TO THE MAINTENANCE OF RECORDS THAT, IN REASONABLE DETAIL, ACCURATELY AND FAIRLY REFLECT THE TRANSACTIONS AND DISPOSITIONS OF THE ASSETS OF THE COMPANY; (2) PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE THAT TRANSACTIONS ARE RECORDED AS NECESSARY TO PERMIT PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES, AND THAT RECEIPTS AND EXPENDITURES OF THE COMPANY ARE BEING MADE ONLY IN ACCORDANCE WITH AUTHORIZATIONS OF MANAGEMENT AND DIRECTORS OF THE COMPANY; AND (3) PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING PREVENTION OR TIMELY DETECTION OF UNAUTHORIZED ACQUISITION, USE, OR DISPOSITION OF THE COMPANY’S ASSETS THAT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

BECAUSE OF ITS INHERENT LIMITATIONS, INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING MAY NOT PREVENT OR DETECT MISSTATEMENTS. ALSO, PROJECTIONS OF ANY EVALUATION OF EFFECTIVENESS TO FUTURE PERIODS ARE SUBJECT TO THE RISK THAT CONTROLS MAY BECOME INADEQUATE BECAUSE OF CHANGES IN CONDITIONS, OR THAT THE DEGREE OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE POLICIES OR PROCEDURES MAY DETERIORATE.

IN OUR OPINION, INTEL CORPORATION MAINTAINED, IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS, EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF

DECEMBER 27, 2014

, BASED ON THE COSO CRITERIA.

WE ALSO HAVE AUDITED, IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE STANDARDS OF THE PUBLIC COMPANY ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BOARD (UNITED STATES), THE

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 1: BASIS OF PRESENTATION

WE HAVE A 52- OR 53-WEEK FISCAL YEAR THAT ENDS ON THE LAST SATURDAY IN DECEMBER. FISCAL YEARS

2014

,

2013

, AND

2012

WERE ALL 52-WEEK YEARS. THE NEXT 53-WEEK YEAR WILL END ON DECEMBER 31, 2016. OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDE THE ACCOUNTS OF INTEL CORPORATION AND OUR SUBSIDIARIES. WE HAVE ELIMINATED INTERCOMPANY ACCOUNTS AND TRANSACTIONS. WE USE THE EQUITY METHOD TO ACCOUNT FOR EQUITY INVESTMENTS IN INSTANCES IN WHICH WE OWN COMMON STOCK OR SIMILAR INTERESTS AND HAVE THE ABILITY TO EXERCISE SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE, BUT NOT CONTROL, OVER THE INVESTEE. WE HAVE RECLASSIFIED CERTAIN PRIOR PERIOD AMOUNTS TO CONFORM TO CURRENT PERIOD PRESENTATION.

NOTE 2: ACCOUNTING POLICIES

USE OF ESTIMATES

THE PREPARATION OF CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN CONFORMITY WITH U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES REQUIRES US TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS THAT AFFECT THE AMOUNTS REPORTED IN OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND THE ACCOMPANYING NOTES. THE ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES THAT REQUIRE OUR MOST SIGNIFICANT, DIFFICULT, AND SUBJECTIVE JUDGMENTS INCLUDE.

•

THE VALUATION OF NON-MARKETABLE EQUITY INVESTMENTS AND THE DETERMINATION OF OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENTS;

•

THE ASSESSMENT OF RECOVERABILITY OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS (PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT; GOODWILL; AND IDENTIFIED INTANGIBLES);

•

THE RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT OF CURRENT AND DEFERRED INCOME TAXES (INCLUDING THE MEASUREMENT OF UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS);

•

THE VALUATION OF INVENTORY; AND

•

THE RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT OF LOSS CONTINGENCIES.

THE ACTUAL RESULTS THAT WE EXPERIENCE MAY DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM OUR ESTIMATES.

FAIR VALUE

FAIR VALUE IS THE PRICE THAT WOULD BE RECEIVED FROM SELLING AN ASSET OR PAID TO TRANSFER A LIABILITY IN AN ORDERLY TRANSACTION BETWEEN MARKET PARTICIPANTS AT THE MEASUREMENT DATE. WHEN DETERMINING FAIR VALUE, WE CONSIDER THE PRINCIPAL OR MOST ADVANTAGEOUS MARKET IN WHICH WE WOULD TRANSACT, AND WE CONSIDER ASSUMPTIONS THAT MARKET PARTICIPANTS WOULD USE WHEN PRICING THE ASSET OR LIABILITY. OUR FINANCIAL ASSETS ARE MEASURED AND RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE, EXCEPT FOR COST METHOD INVESTMENTS, COST METHOD LOANS RECEIVABLE, EQUITY METHOD INVESTMENTS, GRANTS RECEIVABLE, AND REVERSE REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS WITH ORIGINAL MATURITIES GREATER THAN APPROXIMATELY THREE MONTHS. SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR LIABILITIES ARE NOT MEASURED AND RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE.

FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY

THE THREE LEVELS OF INPUTS THAT MAY BE USED TO MEASURE FAIR VALUE ARE AS FOLLOWS.

LEVEL 1.

QUOTED PRICES IN ACTIVE MARKETS FOR IDENTICAL ASSETS OR LIABILITIES.

LEVEL 2.

OBSERVABLE INPUTS OTHER THAN LEVEL 1 PRICES, SUCH AS QUOTED PRICES FOR SIMILAR ASSETS OR LIABILITIES, QUOTED PRICES IN LESS ACTIVE MARKETS, OR MODEL-DERIVED VALUATIONS IN WHICH ALL SIGNIFICANT INPUTS ARE OBSERVABLE OR CAN BE DERIVED PRINCIPALLY FROM OR CORROBORATED WITH OBSERVABLE MARKET DATA FOR SUBSTANTIALLY THE FULL TERM OF THE ASSETS OR LIABILITIES. LEVEL 2 INPUTS ALSO INCLUDE NON-BINDING MARKET CONSENSUS PRICES THAT CAN BE CORROBORATED WITH OBSERVABLE MARKET DATA, AS WELL AS QUOTED PRICES THAT WERE ADJUSTED FOR SECURITY-SPECIFIC RESTRICTIONS.

LEVEL 3.

UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS TO THE VALUATION METHODOLOGY THAT ARE SIGNIFICANT TO THE MEASUREMENT OF THE FAIR VALUE OF ASSETS OR LIABILITIES. LEVEL 3 INPUTS ALSO INCLUDE NON-BINDING MARKET CONSENSUS PRICES OR NON-BINDING BROKER QUOTES THAT WE WERE UNABLE TO CORROBORATE WITH OBSERVABLE MARKET DATA.

FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION OF FAIR VALUE, SEE "

NOTE 4: FAIR VALUE

TABLE OF CONTENTS

INTEL CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

CASH EQUIVALENTS

WE CONSIDER ALL HIGHLY LIQUID DEBT INVESTMENTS WITH ORIGINAL MATURITIES FROM THE DATE OF PURCHASE OF APPROXIMATELY THREE MONTHS OR LESS AS CASH EQUIVALENTS. CASH EQUIVALENTS CAN INCLUDE INVESTMENTS SUCH AS CORPORATE DEBT, FINANCIAL INSTITUTION INSTRUMENTS, GOVERNMENT DEBT, AND REVERSE REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS CLASSIFIED AS CASH EQUIVALENTS. SEE "

NOTE 4: FAIR VALUE

" FOR THE INSTRUMENTS HELD AS CASH EQUIVALENTS.

TRADING ASSETS

MARKETABLE DEBT INSTRUMENTS ARE GENERALLY DESIGNATED AS TRADING ASSETS WHEN A MARKET RISK IS ECONOMICALLY HEDGED AT INCEPTION WITH A RELATED DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENT, OR WHEN THE MARKETABLE DEBT INSTRUMENT ITSELF IS USED TO ECONOMICALLY HEDGE FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATE RISK FROM REMEASUREMENT. INVESTMENTS DESIGNATED AS TRADING ASSETS ARE REPORTED AT FAIR VALUE. THE GAINS OR LOSSES OF THESE INVESTMENTS ARISING FROM CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE DUE TO INTEREST RATE AND CURRENCY MARKET FLUCTUATIONS AND CREDIT MARKET VOLATILITY, LARGELY OFFSET BY LOSSES OR GAINS ON THE RELATED DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND BALANCE SHEET REMEASUREMENT, ARE RECORDED IN INTEREST AND OTHER, NET. WE ALSO DESIGNATE CERTAIN FLOATING-RATE SECURITIZED FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, PRIMARILY ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES, AS TRADING ASSETS.

AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE INVESTMENTS

WE CONSIDER ALL LIQUID AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE DEBT INSTRUMENTS WITH ORIGINAL MATURITIES FROM THE DATE OF PURCHASE OF APPROXIMATELY THREE MONTHS OR LESS TO BE CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS. AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE DEBT INSTRUMENTS WITH ORIGINAL MATURITIES AT THE DATE OF PURCHASE GREATER THAN APPROXIMATELY THREE MONTHS AND REMAINING MATURITIES OF LESS THAN ONE YEAR ARE CLASSIFIED AS SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS. AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE DEBT INSTRUMENTS WITH REMAINING MATURITIES BEYOND ONE YEAR ARE CLASSIFIED AS OTHER LONG-TERM INVESTMENTS.

INVESTMENTS THAT WE DESIGNATE AS AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE ARE REPORTED AT FAIR VALUE, WITH UNREALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES, NET OF TAX, RECORDED IN ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS), EXCEPT AS NOTED IN THE "OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENT" SECTION THAT FOLLOWS. WE DETERMINE THE COST OF THE INVESTMENT SOLD BASED ON AN AVERAGE COST BASIS AT THE INDIVIDUAL SECURITY LEVEL. OUR AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE INVESTMENTS INCLUDE.

•

MARKETABLE DEBT INSTRUMENTS

WHEN THE INTEREST RATE AND FOREIGN CURRENCY RISKS ARE NOT HEDGED AT THE INCEPTION OF THE INVESTMENT OR WHEN OUR CRITERIA FOR DESIGNATION AS TRADING ASSETS ARE NOT MET. WE GENERALLY HOLD THESE DEBT INSTRUMENTS TO GENERATE A RETURN COMMENSURATE WITH THE U.S.-DOLLAR THREE-MONTH LIBOR. WE RECORD THE INTEREST INCOME AND REALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES ON THE SALE OF THESE INSTRUMENTS IN INTEREST AND OTHER, NET.

•

MARKETABLE EQUITY SECURITIES

WHEN THERE IS NO PLAN TO SELL OR HEDGE THE INVESTMENT AT THE TIME OF ORIGINAL CLASSIFICATION. WE ACQUIRE THESE EQUITY INVESTMENTS TO PROMOTE BUSINESS AND STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES. TO THE EXTENT THAT THESE INVESTMENTS CONTINUE TO HAVE STRATEGIC VALUE, WE TYPICALLY DO NOT ATTEMPT TO REDUCE OR ELIMINATE THE EQUITY MARKET RISKS THROUGH HEDGING ACTIVITIES. WE RECORD THE REALIZED GAINS OR LOSSES ON THE SALE OR EXCHANGE OF MARKETABLE EQUITY SECURITIES IN GAINS (LOSSES) ON EQUITY INVESTMENTS, NET.

NON-MARKETABLE AND OTHER EQUITY INVESTMENTS

OUR NON-MARKETABLE EQUITY AND OTHER EQUITY INVESTMENTS ARE INCLUDED IN OTHER LONG-TERM ASSETS. WE ACCOUNT FOR NON-MARKETABLE EQUITY AND OTHER EQUITY INVESTMENTS FOR WHICH WE DO NOT HAVE CONTROL OVER THE INVESTEE AS.

•

EQUITY METHOD INVESTMENTS

WHEN WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO EXERCISE SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE, BUT NOT CONTROL, OVER THE INVESTEE. EQUITY METHOD INVESTMENTS INCLUDE MARKETABLE AND NON-MARKETABLE INVESTMENTS. OUR PROPORTIONATE SHARE OF THE INCOME OR LOSS IS RECOGNIZED ON A ONE-QUARTER LAG AND IS RECORDED IN GAINS (LOSSES) ON EQUITY INVESTMENTS, NET.

•

NON-MARKETABLE COST METHOD INVESTMENTS

WHEN THE EQUITY METHOD DOES NOT APPLY.

WE RECORD THE REALIZED GAINS OR LOSSES ON THE SALE OF EQUITY METHOD AND NON-MARKETABLE COST METHOD INVESTMENTS IN GAINS (LOSSES) ON EQUITY INVESTMENTS, NET.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

INTEL CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENT

OUR AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE INVESTMENTS AND NON-MARKETABLE AND OTHER EQUITY INVESTMENTS ARE SUBJECT TO A PERIODIC IMPAIRMENT REVIEW. INVESTMENTS ARE CONSIDERED IMPAIRED WHEN THE FAIR VALUE IS BELOW THE INVESTMENT’S ADJUSTED COST BASIS. IMPAIRMENTS AFFECT EARNINGS AS FOLLOWS.

•

MARKETABLE DEBT INSTRUMENTS

WHEN THE FAIR VALUE IS BELOW AMORTIZED COST AND WE INTEND TO SELL THE INSTRUMENT, OR WHEN IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT WE WILL BE REQUIRED TO SELL THE INSTRUMENT BEFORE RECOVERY OF ITS AMORTIZED COST BASIS, OR WHEN WE DO NOT EXPECT TO RECOVER THE ENTIRE AMORTIZED COST BASIS OF THE INSTRUMENT (THAT IS, A CREDIT LOSS EXISTS). WHEN WE DO NOT EXPECT TO RECOVER THE ENTIRE AMORTIZED COST BASIS OF THE INSTRUMENT, WE SEPARATE OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENTS INTO AMOUNTS REPRESENTING CREDIT LOSSES, WHICH ARE RECOGNIZED IN INTEREST AND OTHER, NET, AND AMOUNTS RELATED TO ALL OTHER FACTORS, WHICH ARE RECOGNIZED IN OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS).

•

MARKETABLE EQUITY SECURITIES

BASED ON THE SPECIFIC FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES PRESENT AT THE TIME OF ASSESSMENT, WHICH INCLUDE THE CONSIDERATION OF GENERAL MARKET CONDITIONS, THE DURATION AND EXTENT TO WHICH THE FAIR VALUE IS BELOW COST, AND OUR ABILITY AND INTENT TO HOLD THE INVESTMENT FOR A SUFFICIENT PERIOD OF TIME TO ALLOW FOR RECOVERY OF VALUE IN THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. WE ALSO CONSIDER SPECIFIC ADVERSE CONDITIONS RELATED TO THE FINANCIAL HEALTH OF, AND THE BUSINESS OUTLOOK FOR, THE INVESTEE, WHICH MAY INCLUDE INDUSTRY AND SECTOR PERFORMANCE, CHANGES IN TECHNOLOGY, OPERATIONAL AND FINANCING CASH FLOW FACTORS, AND CHANGES IN THE INVESTEE’S CREDIT RATING. WE RECORD OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENTS ON MARKETABLE EQUITY SECURITIES AND MARKETABLE EQUITY METHOD INVESTMENTS IN GAINS (LOSSES) ON EQUITY INVESTMENTS, NET.

•

NON-MARKETABLE EQUITY INVESTMENTS

BASED ON OUR ASSESSMENT OF THE SEVERITY AND DURATION OF THE IMPAIRMENT, AND QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS, INCLUDING.

•

THE INVESTEE’S REVENUE AND EARNINGS TRENDS RELATIVE TO PRE-DEFINED MILESTONES AND OVERALL BUSINESS PROSPECTS;

•

THE TECHNOLOGICAL FEASIBILITY OF THE INVESTEE’S PRODUCTS AND TECHNOLOGIES;

•

THE GENERAL MARKET CONDITIONS IN THE INVESTEE’S INDUSTRY OR GEOGRAPHIC AREA, INCLUDING ADVERSE REGULATORY OR ECONOMIC CHANGES;

•

THE MANAGEMENT AND GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE OF THE INVESTEE;

•

FACTORS RELATED TO THE INVESTEE’S ABILITY TO REMAIN IN BUSINESS, SUCH AS THE INVESTEE’S LIQUIDITY AND DEBT RATIOS, AND THE RATE AT WHICH THE INVESTEE IS USING ITS CASH; AND

•

THE INVESTEE’S RECEIPT OF ADDITIONAL FUNDING AT A LOWER VALUATION.

WE RECORD OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENTS FOR NON-MARKETABLE COST METHOD INVESTMENTS AND EQUITY METHOD INVESTMENTS IN GAINS (LOSSES) ON EQUITY INVESTMENTS, NET.

DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

OUR PRIMARY OBJECTIVE FOR HOLDING DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS IS TO MANAGE CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE RISK AND INTEREST RATE RISK, AND, TO A LESSER EXTENT, EQUITY MARKET RISK, COMMODITY PRICE RISK, AND CREDIT RISK.

WHEN POSSIBLE, WE ENTER INTO MASTER NETTING ARRANGEMENTS WITH COUNTERPARTIES TO MITIGATE CREDIT RISK IN DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS. A MASTER NETTING ARRANGEMENT MAY ALLOW COUNTERPARTIES TO NET SETTLE AMOUNTS OWED TO EACH OTHER AS A RESULT OF MULTIPLE, SEPARATE DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS.

GENERALLY, OUR MASTER NETTING AGREEMENTS ALLOW FOR NET SETTLEMENT IN CASE OF CERTAIN TRIGGERING EVENTS SUCH AS BANKRUPTCY OR DEFAULT OF ONE OF THE COUNTERPARTIES TO THE TRANSACTION. WE MAY ALSO ELECT TO EXCHANGE CASH COLLATERAL WITH CERTAIN OF OUR COUNTERPARTIES ON A REGULAR BASIS.

FOR PRESENTATION ON OUR CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS, WE DO NOT OFFSET FAIR VALUE AMOUNTS RECOGNIZED FOR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS UNDER MASTER NETTING ARRANGEMENTS.

OUR DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS ARE RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE AND ARE INCLUDED IN OTHER CURRENT ASSETS, OTHER LONG-TERM ASSETS, OTHER ACCRUED LIABILITIES, OR OTHER LONG-TERM LIABILITIES.

OUR ACCOUNTING POLICIES FOR DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS ARE BASED ON WHETHER THEY MEET THE CRITERIA FOR DESIGNATION AS A CASH FLOW HEDGE. A DESIGNATED HEDGE WITH EXPOSURE TO VARIABILITY IN THE FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY EQUIVALENT OF THE FUTURE FOREIGN CURRENCY CASH FLOWS OF A FORECASTED TRANSACTION IS ONE EXAMPLE OF A CASH FLOW HEDGE. THE CRITERIA FOR DESIGNATING A DERIVATIVE AS A CASH FLOW HEDGE INCLUDE THE ASSESSMENT OF THE INSTRUMENT’S EFFECTIVENESS IN RISK REDUCTION, MATCHING OF THE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENT TO ITS UNDERLYING TRANSACTION, AND THE ASSESSMENT OF THE PROBABILITY THAT THE UNDERLYING TRANSACTION WILL OCCUR. FOR DERIVATIVES WITH CASH FLOW HEDGE ACCOUNTING DESIGNATION, WE REPORT THE AFTER-TAX GAIN OR LOSS FROM THE EFFECTIVE PORTION OF THE HEDGE AS A COMPONENT OF ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS) AND RECLASSIFY IT INTO EARNINGS IN THE SAME PERIOD OR PERIODS IN WHICH THE HEDGED TRANSACTION AFFECTS EARNINGS, AND IN THE SAME LINE ITEM ON THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME AS THE IMPACT OF THE HEDGED TRANSACTION. DERIVATIVES THAT WE DESIGNATE AS CASH FLOW HEDGES ARE CLASSIFIED IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS IN THE SAME SECTION AS THE UNDERLYING ITEM, PRIMARILY WITHIN CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES.

62

TABLE OF CONTENTS

INTEL CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

WE RECOGNIZE GAINS AND LOSSES FROM CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE OF DERIVATIVES THAT ARE NOT DESIGNATED AS HEDGES FOR ACCOUNTING PURPOSES IN THE LINE ITEM ON THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME MOST CLOSELY ASSOCIATED WITH THE RELATED EXPOSURES, PRIMARILY IN INTEREST AND OTHER, NET AND GAINS (LOSSES) ON EQUITY INVESTMENTS, NET. AS PART OF OUR STRATEGIC INVESTMENT PROGRAM, WE ALSO ACQUIRE EQUITY DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS, SUCH AS EQUITY CONVERSION RIGHTS ASSOCIATED WITH DEBT INSTRUMENTS, THAT WE DO NOT DESIGNATE AS HEDGING INSTRUMENTS. WE RECOGNIZE THE GAINS OR LOSSES FROM CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE OF THESE EQUITY DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS IN GAINS (LOSSES) ON EQUITY INVESTMENTS, NET. REALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES FROM DERIVATIVES NOT DESIGNATED AS HEDGES ARE CLASSIFIED IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS WITHIN CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES OR INVESTING ACTIVITIES, DEPENDING ON THE ACTIVITY THE EXPOSURE IS MOST CLOSELY ASSOCIATED WITH.

MEASUREMENT OF EFFECTIVENESS

•

EFFECTIVENESS FOR FORWARDS

IS GENERALLY MEASURED BY COMPARING THE CUMULATIVE CHANGE IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE HEDGE CONTRACT WITH THE CUMULATIVE CHANGE IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE FORECASTED CASH FLOWS OF THE HEDGED ITEM. FOR CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS USED IN CASH FLOW HEDGING STRATEGIES RELATED TO CAPITAL PURCHASES, FORWARD POINTS ARE EXCLUDED, AND EFFECTIVENESS IS MEASURED USING SPOT RATES TO VALUE BOTH THE HEDGE CONTRACT AND THE HEDGED ITEM. FOR CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS USED IN CASH FLOW HEDGING STRATEGIES RELATED TO OPERATING EXPENDITURES, FORWARD POINTS ARE INCLUDED, AND EFFECTIVENESS IS MEASURED USING FORWARD RATES TO VALUE BOTH THE HEDGE CONTRACT AND THE HEDGED ITEM.

•

EFFECTIVENESS FOR OPTIONS

IS GENERALLY MEASURED BY COMPARING THE CUMULATIVE CHANGE IN THE INTRINSIC VALUE OF THE HEDGE CONTRACT WITH THE CUMULATIVE CHANGE IN THE INTRINSIC VALUE OF AN OPTION INSTRUMENT REPRESENTING THE HEDGED RISKS IN THE HEDGED ITEM. TIME VALUE IS EXCLUDED AND EFFECTIVENESS IS MEASURED USING SPOT RATES TO VALUE BOTH THE HEDGE CONTRACT AND THE HEDGED ITEM.

•

EFFECTIVENESS FOR INTEREST RATE SWAPS AND COMMODITY SWAPS

IS GENERALLY MEASURED BY COMPARING THE CUMULATIVE CHANGE IN FAIR VALUE OF THE SWAP WITH THE CUMULATIVE CHANGE IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE HEDGED ITEM.

IF A CASH FLOW HEDGE IS DISCONTINUED BECAUSE IT IS PROBABLE THAT THE ORIGINAL HEDGED TRANSACTION WILL NOT OCCUR AS PREVIOUSLY ANTICIPATED, THE CUMULATIVE UNREALIZED GAIN OR LOSS ON THE RELATED DERIVATIVE IS RECLASSIFIED FROM ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS) INTO EARNINGS. SUBSEQUENT GAINS OR LOSSES ON THE RELATED DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENT ARE RECOGNIZED IN INTEREST AND OTHER, NET IN EACH PERIOD UNTIL THE INSTRUMENT MATURES, IS TERMINATED, IS RE-DESIGNATED AS A QUALIFIED CASH FLOW HEDGE, OR IS SOLD. INEFFECTIVE PORTIONS OF CASH FLOW HEDGES, AS WELL AS AMOUNTS EXCLUDED FROM THE ASSESSMENT OF EFFECTIVENESS, ARE RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS IN INTEREST AND OTHER, NET. FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION OF OUR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND RISK MANAGEMENT PROGRAMS, SEE "

NOTE 6: DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

SECURITIES LENDING

WE MAY ENTER INTO SECURITIES LENDING AGREEMENTS WITH FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, GENERALLY TO FACILITATE HEDGING AND CERTAIN INVESTMENT AND FINANCING TRANSACTIONS. SELECTED SECURITIES MAY BE LOANED, SECURED BY COLLATERAL IN THE FORM OF CASH OR SECURITIES. THE LOANED SECURITIES CONTINUE TO BE CARRIED AS INVESTMENT ASSETS ON OUR CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS. FOR LENDING AGREEMENTS COLLATERALIZED BY CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS, COLLATERAL IS RECORDED AS AN ASSET WITH A CORRESPONDING LIABILITY. FOR LENDING AGREEMENTS COLLATERALIZED BY OTHER SECURITIES, WE DO NOT RECORD THE COLLATERAL AS AN ASSET OR A LIABILITY, UNLESS THE COLLATERAL IS REPLEDGED.

LOANS RECEIVABLE

WE MAKE LOANS TO THIRD PARTIES THAT ARE CLASSIFIED WITHIN OTHER CURRENT ASSETS OR OTHER LONG-TERM ASSETS. WE MAY ELECT THE FAIR VALUE OPTION FOR LOANS WHEN THE INTEREST RATE OR FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE RISK IS ECONOMICALLY HEDGED AT INCEPTION WITH A RELATED DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENT. WE RECORD THE GAINS OR LOSSES ON THESE LOANS ARISING FROM CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE DUE TO INTEREST RATE, CURRENCY, AND COUNTERPARTY CREDIT CHANGES, LARGELY OFFSET BY LOSSES OR GAINS ON THE RELATED DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS, IN INTEREST AND OTHER, NET. LOANS THAT ARE DENOMINATED IN U.S. DOLLARS AND HAVE A FLOATING-RATE COUPON ARE CARRIED AT AMORTIZED COST. WE MEASURE INTEREST INCOME FOR ALL LOANS RECEIVABLE USING THE INTEREST METHOD, WHICH IS BASED ON THE EFFECTIVE YIELD OF THE LOANS RATHER THAN THE STATED COUPON RATE.

GOODWILL

WE RECORD GOODWILL WHEN THE PURCHASE PRICE OF AN ACQUISITION EXCEEDS THE FAIR VALUE OF THE NET TANGIBLE AND IDENTIFIED INTANGIBLE ASSETS ACQUIRED. WE ASSIGN THE GOODWILL TO OUR REPORTING UNITS BASED ON THE RELATIVE EXPECTED FAIR VALUE PROVIDED BY THE ACQUISITION.

WE PERFORM AN ANNUAL IMPAIRMENT ASSESSMENT IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF EACH YEAR, OR MORE FREQUENTLY IF INDICATORS OF POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT EXIST

, WHICH INCLUDES EVALUATING QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE FACTORS TO ASSESS THE LIKELIHOOD OF AN IMPAIRMENT OF A REPORTING UNIT’S GOODWILL. WE PERFORM IMPAIRMENT TESTS USING A FAIR VALUE APPROACH WHEN NECESSARY. THE REPORTING UNIT’S CARRYING VALUE USED IN AN IMPAIRMENT TEST REPRESENTS THE ASSIGNMENT OF VARIOUS ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, EXCLUDING CERTAIN CORPORATE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, SUCH AS CASH, INVESTMENTS, AND DEBT. FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION OF GOODWILL, SEE "

IDENTIFIED INTANGIBLE ASSETS

LICENSED TECHNOLOGY AND PATENTS ARE GENERALLY AMORTIZED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THE PERIODS OF BENEFIT. WE AMORTIZE ALL ACQUISITION-RELATED INTANGIBLE ASSETS THAT ARE SUBJECT TO AMORTIZATION OVER THEIR ESTIMATED USEFUL LIFE BASED ON ECONOMIC BENEFIT. ACQUISITION-RELATED IN-PROCESS R&D ASSETS REPRESENT THE FAIR VALUE OF INCOMPLETE R&D PROJECTS THAT HAD NOT REACHED TECHNOLOGICAL FEASIBILITY AS OF THE DATE OF ACQUISITION; INITIALLY, THESE ARE CLASSIFIED AS "OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS" THAT ARE NOT SUBJECT TO AMORTIZATION. ASSETS RELATED TO PROJECTS THAT HAVE BEEN COMPLETED ARE TRANSFERRED FROM "OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS" TO "ACQUISITION-RELATED DEVELOPED TECHNOLOGY;" THESE ARE SUBJECT TO AMORTIZATION, WHILE ASSETS RELATED TO PROJECTS THAT HAVE BEEN ABANDONED ARE IMPAIRED AND EXPENSED TO R&D. IN THE QUARTER FOLLOWING THE PERIOD IN WHICH IDENTIFIED INTANGIBLE ASSETS BECOME FULLY AMORTIZED, WE REMOVE THE FULLY AMORTIZED BALANCES FROM THE GROSS ASSET AND ACCUMULATED AMORTIZATION AMOUNTS.

WE PERFORM A QUARTERLY REVIEW OF FINITE-LIVED IDENTIFIED INTANGIBLE ASSETS TO DETERMINE WHETHER FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THAT THE USEFUL LIFE IS SHORTER THAN WE HAD ORIGINALLY ESTIMATED OR THAT THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF ASSETS MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE. IF SUCH FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES EXIST, WE ASSESS RECOVERABILITY BY COMPARING THE PROJECTED UNDISCOUNTED NET CASH FLOWS ASSOCIATED WITH THE RELATED ASSET OR GROUP OF ASSETS OVER THEIR REMAINING LIVES AGAINST THEIR RESPECTIVE CARRYING AMOUNTS. IMPAIRMENTS, IF ANY, ARE BASED ON THE EXCESS OF THE CARRYING AMOUNT OVER THE FAIR VALUE OF THOSE ASSETS. IF AN ASSET’S USEFUL LIFE IS SHORTER THAN ORIGINALLY ESTIMATED, WE ACCELERATE THE RATE OF AMORTIZATION AND AMORTIZE THE REMAINING CARRYING VALUE OVER THE NEW SHORTER USEFUL LIFE. WE PERFORM AN ANNUAL IMPAIRMENT ASSESSMENT IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF EACH YEAR FOR INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS, OR MORE FREQUENTLY IF INDICATORS OF POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT EXIST, TO DETERMINE WHETHER IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE ASSETS MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE. IF NECESSARY, A QUANTITATIVE IMPAIRMENT TEST IS PERFORMED TO COMPARE THE FAIR VALUE OF THE INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSET WITH ITS CARRYING VALUE. IMPAIRMENTS, IF ANY, ARE BASED ON THE EXCESS OF THE CARRYING AMOUNT OVER THE FAIR VALUE OF THOSE ASSETS.

PRODUCT WARRANTY

THE VAST MAJORITY OF OUR PRODUCTS ARE SOLD WITH A LIMITED WARRANTY ON PRODUCT QUALITY AND A LIMITED INDEMNIFICATION FOR CUSTOMERS AGAINST INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS INFRINGEMENT CLAIMS RELATED TO OUR PRODUCTS. THE ACCRUAL AND THE RELATED EXPENSE FOR KNOWN PRODUCT WARRANTY ISSUES WERE NOT SIGNIFICANT DURING THE PERIODS PRESENTED. DUE TO PRODUCT TESTING, THE SHORT TIME TYPICALLY BETWEEN PRODUCT SHIPMENT AND THE DETECTION AND CORRECTION OF PRODUCT FAILURES, AND THE HISTORICAL RATE OF PAYMENTS ON INDEMNIFICATION CLAIMS, THE ACCRUAL AND RELATED EXPENSE FOR ESTIMATED INCURRED BUT UNIDENTIFIED ISSUES WERE NOT SIGNIFICANT DURING THE PERIODS PRESENTED.

REVENUE RECOGNITION

WE RECOGNIZE NET PRODUCT REVENUE WHEN THE EARNINGS PROCESS IS COMPLETE, AS EVIDENCED BY AN AGREEMENT WITH THE CUSTOMER, DELIVERY HAS OCCURRED, AND ACCEPTANCE, IF APPLICABLE, AS WELL AS FIXED PRICING AND PROBABLE COLLECTIBILITY. WE RECORD PRICING ALLOWANCES, INCLUDING DISCOUNTS BASED ON CONTRACTUAL ARRANGEMENTS WITH CUSTOMERS, WHEN WE RECOGNIZE REVENUE AS A REDUCTION TO BOTH ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND NET REVENUE. BECAUSE OF FREQUENT SALES PRICE REDUCTIONS AND RAPID TECHNOLOGY OBSOLESCENCE IN THE INDUSTRY, WE DEFER PRODUCT REVENUE AND RELATED COSTS OF SALES FROM COMPONENT SALES MADE TO DISTRIBUTORS UNDER AGREEMENTS ALLOWING PRICE PROTECTION OR RIGHT OF RETURN UNTIL THE DISTRIBUTORS SELL THE MERCHANDISE. THE RIGHT OF RETURN GRANTED GENERALLY CONSISTS OF A STOCK ROTATION PROGRAM IN WHICH DISTRIBUTORS ARE ABLE TO EXCHANGE CERTAIN PRODUCTS BASED ON THE NUMBER OF QUALIFIED PURCHASES MADE BY THE DISTRIBUTOR. UNDER THE PRICE PROTECTION PROGRAM, WE GIVE DISTRIBUTORS CREDITS FOR THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE ORIGINAL PRICE PAID AND THE CURRENT PRICE THAT WE OFFER. WE INCLUDE SHIPPING CHARGES BILLED TO CUSTOMERS IN NET REVENUE, AND INCLUDE THE RELATED SHIPPING COSTS IN COST OF SALES.

REVENUE DERIVED FROM ONLINE SUBSCRIPTION PRODUCTS IS DEFERRED AND RECOGNIZED RATABLY OVER THE PERFORMANCE PERIOD. PROFESSIONAL SERVICES REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED AS SERVICES ARE PERFORMED OR, IF REQUIRED, UPON CUSTOMER ACCEPTANCE. FOR ARRANGEMENTS WITH MULTIPLE ELEMENTS, INCLUDING SOFTWARE LICENSES, MAINTENANCE, AND/OR SERVICES, REVENUE IS ALLOCATED ACROSS THE SEPARATELY IDENTIFIED DELIVERABLES AND MAY BE RECOGNIZED OR DEFERRED. WHEN VENDOR-SPECIFIC OBJECTIVE EVIDENCE DOES NOT EXIST FOR UNDELIVERED ELEMENTS SUCH AS MAINTENANCE AND SUPPORT, THE ENTIRE ARRANGEMENT FEE IS RECOGNIZED RATABLY OVER THE PERFORMANCE PERIOD. DIRECT COSTS, SUCH AS COSTS RELATED TO REVENUE-SHARING AND ROYALTY ARRANGEMENTS ASSOCIATED WITH LICENSE ARRANGEMENTS, AS WELL AS COMPONENT COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH PRODUCT REVENUE AND SALES COMMISSIONS, ARE DEFERRED AND AMORTIZED OVER THE SAME PERIOD THAT THE RELATED REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED.

WE RECORD DEFERRED REVENUE OFFSET BY THE RELATED COST OF SALES ON OUR CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS AS DEFERRED INCOME.

ADVERTISING

COOPERATIVE ADVERTISING PROGRAMS REIMBURSE CUSTOMERS FOR MARKETING ACTIVITIES FOR CERTAIN OF OUR PRODUCTS, SUBJECT TO DEFINED CRITERIA. WE ACCRUE COOPERATIVE ADVERTISING OBLIGATIONS AND RECORD THE COSTS AT THE SAME TIME THAT THE RELATED REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED. WE RECORD COOPERATIVE ADVERTISING COSTS AS MARKETING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE (MG&A) EXPENSES TO THE EXTENT THAT AN ADVERTISING BENEFIT SEPARATE FROM THE REVENUE TRANSACTION CAN BE IDENTIFIED AND THE FAIR VALUE OF THAT ADVERTISING BENEFIT RECEIVED IS DETERMINABLE. WE RECORD ANY EXCESS IN CASH PAID TO CUSTOMERS OVER THE FAIR VALUE OF THE ADVERTISING BENEFIT WE RECEIVE AS A REDUCTION IN REVENUE.

UPON EXERCISE, CANCELLATION, FORFEITURE, OR EXPIRATION OF STOCK OPTIONS, OR UPON VESTING OR FORFEITURE OF RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS, WE ELIMINATE DEFERRED TAX ASSETS FOR OPTIONS AND RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS WITH MULTIPLE VESTING DATES FOR EACH VESTING PERIOD ON A FIRST-IN, FIRST-OUT BASIS AS IF EACH VESTING PERIOD WERE A SEPARATE AWARD.

INCOME TAXES

WE COMPUTE THE PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES USING THE ASSET AND LIABILITY METHOD, UNDER WHICH DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE RECOGNIZED FOR THE EXPECTED FUTURE TAX CONSEQUENCES OF TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE FINANCIAL REPORTING AND TAX BASES OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, AND FOR OPERATING LOSSES AND TAX CREDIT CARRYFORWARDS. WE MEASURE DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES USING THE CURRENTLY ENACTED TAX RATES THAT APPLY TO TAXABLE INCOME IN EFFECT FOR THE YEARS IN WHICH THOSE TAX ASSETS ARE EXPECTED TO BE REALIZED OR SETTLED. WE RECORD A VALUATION ALLOWANCE TO REDUCE DEFERRED TAX ASSETS TO THE AMOUNT THAT IT IS BELIEVED MORE LIKELY THAN NOT TO BE REALIZED.

WE RECOGNIZE TAX BENEFITS FROM UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS ONLY IF THAT TAX POSITION IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT TO BE SUSTAINED ON EXAMINATION BY THE TAXING AUTHORITIES, BASED ON THE TECHNICAL MERITS OF THE POSITION. WE THEN MEASURE THE TAX BENEFITS RECOGNIZED IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FROM SUCH POSITIONS BASED ON THE LARGEST BENEFIT THAT HAS A GREATER THAN 50% LIKELIHOOD OF BEING REALIZED UPON ULTIMATE SETTLEMENT.

NOTE 3: RECENT ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

IN MAY 2014, THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD ISSUED A NEW STANDARD TO ACHIEVE A CONSISTENT APPLICATION OF REVENUE RECOGNITION WITHIN THE U.S., RESULTING IN A SINGLE REVENUE MODEL TO BE APPLIED BY REPORTING COMPANIES UNDER U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES. UNDER THE NEW MODEL, RECOGNITION OF REVENUE OCCURS WHEN A CUSTOMER OBTAINS CONTROL OF PROMISED GOODS OR SERVICES IN AN AMOUNT THAT REFLECTS THE CONSIDERATION TO WHICH THE ENTITY EXPECTS TO BE ENTITLED IN EXCHANGE FOR THOSE GOODS OR SERVICES. IN ADDITION, THE NEW STANDARD REQUIRES THAT REPORTING COMPANIES DISCLOSE THE NATURE, AMOUNT, TIMING, AND UNCERTAINTY OF REVENUE AND CASH FLOWS ARISING FROM CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS. THE NEW STANDARD IS EFFECTIVE FOR US BEGINNING IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2017; EARLY ADOPTION IS PROHIBITED. THE NEW STANDARD IS REQUIRED TO BE APPLIED RETROSPECTIVELY TO EACH PRIOR REPORTING PERIOD PRESENTED OR RETROSPECTIVELY WITH THE CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF INITIALLY APPLYING IT RECOGNIZED AT THE DATE OF INITIAL APPLICATION. WE HAVE NOT YET SELECTED A TRANSITION METHOD NOR HAVE WE DETERMINED THE IMPACT OF THE NEW STANDARD ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

INVESTMENTS IN DEBT INSTRUMENTS

DEBT INSTRUMENTS REFLECTED IN THE PRECEDING TABLE

INCLUDE INVESTMENTS SUCH AS ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES, CORPORATE DEBT, FINANCIAL INSTITUTION INSTRUMENTS, GOVERNMENT DEBT, AND REVERSE REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS CLASSIFIED AS CASH EQUIVALENTS

. WE CLASSIFY OUR DEBT INSTRUMENTS AS LEVEL 2 WHEN WE USE OBSERVABLE MARKET PRICES FOR IDENTICAL SECURITIES THAT ARE TRADED IN LESS ACTIVE MARKETS. WHEN OBSERVABLE MARKET PRICES FOR IDENTICAL SECURITIES ARE NOT AVAILABLE, WE PRICE THE DEBT INSTRUMENTS USING OUR OWN MODELS, SUCH AS A DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW MODEL, OR NON-BINDING MARKET CONSENSUS PRICES BASED ON THE PROPRIETARY VALUATION MODELS OF PRICING PROVIDERS OR BROKERS. WE CORROBORATE NON-BINDING MARKET CONSENSUS PRICES WITH OBSERVABLE MARKET DATA USING STATISTICAL MODELS WHEN OBSERVABLE MARKET DATA EXISTS, QUOTED MARKET PRICES FOR SIMILAR INSTRUMENTS, OR PRICING MODELS SUCH AS A DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW MODEL. THESE VALUATION MODELS INCORPORATE A NUMBER OF INPUTS, INCLUDING NON-BINDING AND BINDING BROKER QUOTES; OBSERVABLE MARKET PRICES FOR IDENTICAL OR SIMILAR INSTRUMENTS; AND THE INTERNAL ASSUMPTIONS OF PRICING PROVIDERS OR BROKERS THAT USE OBSERVABLE MARKET INPUTS AND UNOBSERVABLE MARKET INPUTS THAT WE CONSIDER TO BE NOT SIGNIFICANT. THE DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW MODEL USES OBSERVABLE MARKET INPUTS, SUCH AS LIBOR-BASED YIELD CURVES, CURRENCY SPOT AND FORWARD RATES, AND CREDIT RATINGS. ALL SIGNIFICANT INPUTS ARE DERIVED FROM OR CORROBORATED WITH OBSERVABLE MARKET DATA.

THE FAIR VALUES OF DEBT INSTRUMENTS CLASSIFIED AS LEVEL 3

ARE GENERALLY DERIVED FROM DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW MODELS, PERFORMED EITHER BY US OR OUR PRICING PROVIDERS, USING INPUTS THAT WE ARE UNABLE TO CORROBORATE WITH OBSERVABLE MARKET DATA. WE MONITOR AND REVIEW THE INPUTS AND RESULTS OF THESE VALUATION MODELS TO HELP ENSURE THE FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS ARE REASONABLE AND CONSISTENT WITH MARKET EXPERIENCE IN SIMILAR ASSET CLASSES.

FAIR VALUE OPTION FOR LOANS RECEIVABLE

WE ELECTED THE FAIR VALUE OPTION FOR LOANS RECEIVABLE WHEN THE INTEREST RATE OR CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE RISK WAS HEDGED AT INCEPTION WITH A RELATED DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENT. AS OF

DECEMBER 27, 2014

AND

DECEMBER 28, 2013

, THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR LOANS RECEIVABLE FOR WHICH WE ELECTED THE FAIR VALUE OPTION DID NOT SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFER FROM THE CONTRACTUAL PRINCIPAL BALANCE BASED ON THE CONTRACTUAL CURRENCY. LOANS RECEIVABLE ARE CLASSIFIED WITHIN OTHER CURRENT ASSETS AND OTHER LONG-TERM ASSETS. FAIR VALUE IS DETERMINED USING A DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW MODEL, WITH ALL SIGNIFICANT INPUTS DERIVED FROM OR CORROBORATED WITH OBSERVABLE MARKET DATA. GAINS AND LOSSES FROM CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE ON THE LOANS RECEIVABLE AND RELATED DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS, AS WELL AS INTEREST INCOME, ARE RECORDED IN INTEREST AND OTHER, NET. DURING ALL PERIODS PRESENTED, CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR LOANS RECEIVABLE WERE LARGELY OFFSET BY CHANGES IN THE RELATED DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS, RESULTING IN AN INSIGNIFICANT NET IMPACT ON OUR CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME. GAINS AND LOSSES ATTRIBUTABLE TO CHANGES IN CREDIT RISK ARE DETERMINED USING OBSERVABLE CREDIT DEFAULT SPREADS FOR THE ISSUER OR COMPARABLE COMPANIES; THESE GAINS AND LOSSES WERE INSIGNIFICANT DURING ALL PERIODS PRESENTED. WE DID NOT ELECT THE FAIR VALUE OPTION FOR LOANS RECEIVABLE WHEN THE INTEREST RATE OR CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE RISK WAS NOT HEDGED AT INCEPTION WITH A RELATED DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENT. LOANS RECEIVABLE NOT MEASURED AND RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE ARE INCLUDED IN THE FOLLOWING "FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS NOT RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE ON A RECURRING BASIS" SECTION.

ASSETS MEASURED AND RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE ON A NON-RECURRING BASIS

OUR NON-MARKETABLE EQUITY INVESTMENTS, MARKETABLE EQUITY METHOD INVESTMENTS, AND NON-FINANCIAL ASSETS, SUCH AS INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT, ARE RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE ONLY IF AN IMPAIRMENT IS RECOGNIZED.

SOME OF OUR NON-MARKETABLE EQUITY INVESTMENTS HAVE BEEN MEASURED AND RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE DUE TO EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES THAT SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACTED THE FAIR VALUE OF THOSE INVESTMENTS, RESULTING IN OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENTS. WE CLASSIFIED THESE INVESTMENTS AS LEVEL 3 BECAUSE THE VALUATIONS USED UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS THAT WERE SIGNIFICANT TO THE FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS AND REQUIRED MANAGEMENT JUDGMENT DUE TO THE ABSENCE OF QUOTED MARKET PRICES.

QUALITATIVE ANALYSIS OF OUR INVESTMENTS INVOLVES UNDERSTANDING OUR INVESTEE’S REVENUE AND EARNINGS TRENDS RELATIVE TO PRE-DEFINED MILESTONES AND OVERALL BUSINESS PROSPECTS; THE TECHNOLOGICAL FEASIBILITY OF OUR INVESTEE’S PRODUCTS AND TECHNOLOGIES; THE GENERAL MARKET CONDITIONS IN THE INVESTEE’S INDUSTRY OR GEOGRAPHIC AREA, INCLUDING ADVERSE REGULATORY OR ECONOMIC CHANGES; AND THE MANAGEMENT AND GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE OF THE INVESTEE. QUANTITATIVE ASSESSMENTS OF THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR INVESTMENTS ARE DEVELOPED USING THE MARKET AND INCOME APPROACHES. THE MARKET APPROACH INCLUDES THE USE OF FINANCIAL METRICS AND RATIOS OF COMPARABLE PUBLIC COMPANIES, SUCH AS REVENUE, EARNINGS, COMPARABLE PERFORMANCE MULTIPLES, RECENT FINANCING ROUNDS, THE TERMS OF THE INVESTEES’ ISSUED INTERESTS, AND THE LEVEL OF MARKETABILITY OF THE INVESTMENTS. THE SELECTION OF COMPARABLE COMPANIES REQUIRES MANAGEMENT JUDGMENT AND IS BASED ON A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING COMPARABLE COMPANIES’ SIZES, GROWTH RATES, INDUSTRIES, AND DEVELOPMENT STAGES. THE INCOME APPROACH INCLUDES THE USE OF A DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW MODEL, WHICH REQUIRES SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES REGARDING INVESTEES’ REVENUE, COSTS, AND DISCOUNT RATES BASED ON THE RISK PROFILE OF COMPARABLE COMPANIES. ESTIMATES OF REVENUE AND COSTS ARE DEVELOPED USING AVAILABLE MARKET, HISTORICAL, AND FORECAST DATA.

THE CARRYING AMOUNT AND FAIR VALUE OF SHORT-TERM DEBT EXCLUDE DRAFTS PAYABLE. OUR SHORT-TERM DEBT RECOGNIZED AT AMORTIZED COST INCLUDES OUR 2009 JUNIOR SUBORDINATED CONVERTIBLE DEBENTURES DUE 2039 (2009 DEBENTURES) AND OUR COMMERCIAL PAPER OUTSTANDING AS OF

DECEMBER 27, 2014

. DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2015, HOLDERS MAY, AT THEIR OPTION, SURRENDER THE 2009 DEBENTURES FOR CONVERSION. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION, SEE "

NOTE 15: BORROWINGS

." OUR LONG-TERM DEBT RECOGNIZED AT AMORTIZED COST IS COMPRISED OF OUR SENIOR NOTES AND OUR CONVERTIBLE DEBENTURES. THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR SENIOR NOTES IS DETERMINED USING ACTIVE MARKET PRICES, AND IS THEREFORE CLASSIFIED AS LEVEL 1. THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR 2009 AND 2005 CONVERTIBLE DEBENTURES IS DETERMINED USING DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW MODELS WITH OBSERVABLE MARKET INPUTS, AND TAKES INTO CONSIDERATION VARIABLES SUCH AS INTEREST RATE CHANGES, COMPARABLE INSTRUMENTS, SUBORDINATION DISCOUNT, AND CREDIT-RATING CHANGES, AND IS THEREFORE CLASSIFIED AS LEVEL 2.

THE NVIDIA CORPORATION (NVIDIA) CROSS-LICENSE AGREEMENT LIABILITY IN THE PRECEDING TABLE WAS INCURRED AS A RESULT OF ENTERING INTO A LONG-TERM PATENT CROSS-LICENSE AGREEMENT WITH NVIDIA IN JANUARY 2011, PURSUANT TO WHICH WE AGREED TO MAKE PAYMENTS TO NVIDIA OVER SIX YEARS. AS OF

DECEMBER 27, 2014

AND

DECEMBER 28, 2013

, THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF THE LIABILITY ARISING FROM THE AGREEMENT WAS CLASSIFIED WITHIN OTHER ACCRUED LIABILITIES AND OTHER LONG-TERM LIABILITIES, BASED ON THE EXPECTED TIMING OF THE UNDERLYING PAYMENTS (

$200 MILLION

IN EACH OF JANUARY 2015 AND 2016 TREATED AS CASH USED FOR FINANCING ACTIVITIES). THE FAIR VALUE IS DETERMINED USING A DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW MODEL, WHICH DISCOUNTS FUTURE CASH FLOWS USING OUR INCREMENTAL BORROWING RATES.

IM FLASH TECHNOLOGIES, LLC AND IM FLASH SINGAPORE, LLP

MICRON TECHNOLOGY, INC. (MICRON) AND INTEL FORMED IM FLASH TECHNOLOGIES, LLC (IMFT) IN 2006 AND IM FLASH SINGAPORE, LLP (IMFS) IN 2007 TO MANUFACTURE NAND FLASH MEMORY PRODUCTS FOR MICRON AND INTEL. DURING 2012, WE AMENDED THE OPERATING AGREEMENT FOR IMFT AND ENTERED INTO AGREEMENTS WITH MICRON THAT MODIFIED OUR JOINT VENTURE RELATIONSHIP, INCLUDING AN AGREEMENT TO SELL OUR OWNERSHIP INTEREST IN IMFS. WE RECEIVED $605 MILLION

IN 2012 FROM THE SALE OF ASSETS OF IMFS AND CERTAIN ASSETS OF IMFT TO MICRON.

THE AMENDED OPERATING AGREEMENT FOR IMFT EXTENDED THE TERM OF IMFT TO 2024, UNLESS EARLIER TERMINATED UNDER CERTAIN TERMS AND CONDITIONS, AND PROVIDES THAT IMFT MAY MANUFACTURE CERTAIN EMERGING MEMORY TECHNOLOGIES IN ADDITION TO NAND FLASH MEMORY. THE AMENDED AGREEMENT ALSO PROVIDES FOR CERTAIN RIGHTS THAT, BEGINNING IN 2015, WILL ENABLE US TO SELL TO MICRON OR ENABLE MICRON TO PURCHASE FROM US OUR INTEREST IN IMFT. IF WE EXERCISE THIS RIGHT, MICRON WOULD SET THE CLOSING DATE OF THE TRANSACTION WITHIN TWO YEARS FOLLOWING SUCH ELECTION AND COULD ELECT TO RECEIVE FINANCING FROM US FOR ONE TO TWO YEARS. ADDITIONALLY, OUR AGREEMENTS WITH MICRON INCLUDE A SUPPLY AGREEMENT FOR MICRON TO SUPPLY US WITH NAND FLASH MEMORY PRODUCTS. THESE AGREEMENTS ALSO EXTEND AND EXPAND OUR NAND JOINT DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM WITH MICRON TO INCLUDE EMERGING MEMORY TECHNOLOGIES.

IMFT IS A VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITY. ALL COSTS OF THE IMFT JOINT VENTURE WILL BE PASSED ON TO MICRON AND INTEL PURSUANT TO OUR PURCHASE AGREEMENTS. INTEL'S PORTION OF IMFT COSTS, PRIMARILY RELATED TO PRODUCT PURCHASES AND PRODUCTION-RELATED SERVICES, WAS APPROXIMATELY

$400 MILLION

IN

2014

(APPROXIMATELY

$380 MILLION

IN

. OUR POTENTIAL FUTURE LOSSES COULD BE HIGHER THAN THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF OUR INVESTMENT, AS INTEL AND MICRON ARE LIABLE FOR OTHER FUTURE OPERATING COSTS OR OBLIGATIONS OF IMFT. FUTURE CASH CALLS COULD ALSO INCREASE OUR INVESTMENT BALANCE AND THE RELATED EXPOSURE TO LOSS. IN ADDITION, BECAUSE WE ARE CURRENTLY COMMITTED TO PURCHASING

NOTE 6: DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

OUR PRIMARY OBJECTIVE FOR HOLDING DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS IS TO MANAGE CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE RISK AND INTEREST RATE RISK, AND, TO A LESSER EXTENT, EQUITY MARKET RISK, COMMODITY PRICE RISK, AND CREDIT RISK.

CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE RISK

WE ARE EXPOSED TO CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE RISK, AND GENERALLY HEDGE OUR EXPOSURES WITH CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS, CURRENCY INTEREST RATE SWAPS, OR CURRENCY OPTIONS.

SUBSTANTIALLY ALL

OF OUR REVENUE IS TRANSACTED IN U.S. DOLLARS. HOWEVER, A

SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT

OF OUR OPERATING EXPENDITURES AND CAPITAL PURCHASES IS INCURRED IN OR EXPOSED TO OTHER CURRENCIES,

PRIMARILY THE EURO, THE JAPANESE YEN, THE CHINESE YUAN, AND THE ISRAELI SHEKEL

. WE HAVE ESTABLISHED BALANCE SHEET AND FORECASTED TRANSACTION CURRENCY RISK MANAGEMENT PROGRAMS TO PROTECT AGAINST FLUCTUATIONS IN THE FAIR VALUE AND THE VOLATILITY OF THE FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY EQUIVALENT OF FUTURE CASH FLOWS CAUSED BY CHANGES IN EXCHANGE RATES. OUR NON-U.S.-DOLLAR-DENOMINATED INVESTMENTS IN DEBT INSTRUMENTS AND LOANS RECEIVABLE ARE GENERALLY HEDGED WITH OFFSETTING CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS OR CURRENCY INTEREST RATE SWAPS. WE MAY ALSO HEDGE CURRENCY RISK ARISING FROM FUNDING FOREIGN CURRENCY DENOMINATED FORECASTED INVESTMENTS.

THESE PROGRAMS REDUCE, BUT DO NOT ELIMINATE, THE IMPACT OF CURRENCY EXCHANGE MOVEMENTS.

OUR CURRENCY RISK MANAGEMENT PROGRAMS INCLUDE.

•

CURRENCY DERIVATIVES WITH CASH FLOW HEDGE ACCOUNTING DESIGNATION

THAT UTILIZE CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS AND CURRENCY OPTIONS TO HEDGE EXPOSURES TO THE VARIABILITY IN THE U.S.-DOLLAR EQUIVALENT OF ANTICIPATED NON-U.S.-DOLLAR-DENOMINATED CASH FLOWS.

THESE INSTRUMENTS GENERALLY MATURE WITHIN

12 MONTHS

. FOR THESE DERIVATIVES, WE REPORT THE AFTER-TAX GAIN OR LOSS FROM THE EFFECTIVE PORTION OF THE HEDGE AS A COMPONENT OF ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS), AND WE RECLASSIFY IT INTO EARNINGS IN THE SAME PERIOD OR PERIODS IN WHICH THE HEDGED TRANSACTION AFFECTS EARNINGS, AND IN THE SAME LINE ITEM ON THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME AS THE IMPACT OF THE HEDGED TRANSACTION.

•

CURRENCY DERIVATIVES WITHOUT HEDGE ACCOUNTING DESIGNATION

THAT UTILIZE CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS OR CURRENCY INTEREST RATE SWAPS TO ECONOMICALLY HEDGE THE FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY EQUIVALENT CASH FLOWS OF RECOGNIZED MONETARY ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, NON-U.S.-DOLLAR-DENOMINATED DEBT INSTRUMENTS CLASSIFIED AS TRADING ASSETS, AND HEDGES OF NON-U.S.-DOLLAR-DENOMINATED LOANS RECEIVABLE RECOGNIZED AT FAIR VALUE.

THE MAJORITY OF THESE INSTRUMENTS MATURE WITHIN 12 MONTHS

. CHANGES IN THE FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY EQUIVALENT CASH FLOWS OF THE UNDERLYING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE APPROXIMATELY OFFSET BY THE CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE OF THE RELATED DERIVATIVES. WE RECORD NET GAINS OR LOSSES IN THE LINE ITEM ON THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME MOST CLOSELY ASSOCIATED WITH THE RELATED EXPOSURES, PRIMARILY IN INTEREST AND OTHER, NET, EXCEPT FOR EQUITY-RELATED GAINS OR LOSSES, WHICH WE PRIMARILY RECORD IN GAINS (LOSSES) ON EQUITY INVESTMENTS, NET.

INTEREST RATE RISK

OUR PRIMARY OBJECTIVE FOR HOLDING INVESTMENTS IN DEBT INSTRUMENTS IS TO PRESERVE PRINCIPAL WHILE MAXIMIZING YIELDS. WE GENERALLY SWAP THE RETURNS ON OUR INVESTMENTS IN FIXED-RATE DEBT INSTRUMENTS WITH REMAINING MATURITIES LONGER THAN SIX MONTHS INTO U.S. DOLLAR THREE-MONTH LIBOR-BASED RETURNS, UNLESS MANAGEMENT SPECIFICALLY APPROVES OTHERWISE. THESE SWAPS ARE SETTLED AT VARIOUS INTEREST PAYMENT TIMES INVOLVING CASH PAYMENTS AT EACH INTEREST AND PRINCIPAL PAYMENT DATE, WITH THE MAJORITY OF THE CONTRACTS HAVING QUARTERLY PAYMENTS.

OUR INTEREST RATE RISK MANAGEMENT PROGRAMS INCLUDE.

•

INTEREST RATE DERIVATIVES WITH CASH FLOW HEDGE ACCOUNTING DESIGNATION

THAT UTILIZE INTEREST RATE SWAP AGREEMENTS TO MODIFY THE INTEREST CHARACTERISTICS OF DEBT INSTRUMENTS. FOR THESE DERIVATIVES, WE REPORT THE AFTER-TAX GAIN OR LOSS FROM THE EFFECTIVE PORTION OF THE HEDGE AS A COMPONENT OF ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS), AND WE RECLASSIFY IT INTO EARNINGS IN THE SAME PERIOD OR PERIODS IN WHICH THE HEDGED TRANSACTION AFFECTS EARNINGS, AND IN THE SAME LINE ITEM ON THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME AS THE IMPACT OF THE HEDGED TRANSACTION.

•

INTEREST RATE DERIVATIVES WITHOUT HEDGE ACCOUNTING DESIGNATION

THAT UTILIZE INTEREST RATE SWAPS AND CURRENCY INTEREST RATE SWAPS IN ECONOMIC HEDGING TRANSACTIONS, INCLUDING HEDGES OF NON-U.S.-DOLLAR-DENOMINATED DEBT INSTRUMENTS CLASSIFIED AS TRADING ASSETS AND HEDGES OF NON-U.S.-DOLLAR-DENOMINATED LOANS RECEIVABLE RECOGNIZED AT FAIR VALUE. FLOATING INTEREST RATES ON THE SWAPS GENERALLY RESET ON A QUARTERLY BASIS. CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE DEBT INSTRUMENTS CLASSIFIED AS TRADING ASSETS AND LOANS RECEIVABLE RECOGNIZED AT FAIR VALUE ARE GENERALLY OFFSET BY CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE OF THE RELATED DERIVATIVES, BOTH OF WHICH ARE RECORDED IN INTEREST AND OTHER, NET.

EQUITY MARKET RISK

OUR INVESTMENTS INCLUDE MARKETABLE EQUITY SECURITIES AND EQUITY DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS. WE TYPICALLY DO NOT ATTEMPT TO REDUCE OR ELIMINATE OUR EQUITY MARKET EXPOSURE THROUGH HEDGING ACTIVITIES AT THE INCEPTION OF OUR INVESTMENTS. BEFORE WE ENTER INTO HEDGE ARRANGEMENTS, WE EVALUATE LEGAL, MARKET, AND ECONOMIC FACTORS, AS WELL AS THE EXPECTED TIMING OF DISPOSAL, TO DETERMINE WHETHER HEDGING IS APPROPRIATE. OUR EQUITY MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT PROGRAM MAY INCLUDE EQUITY DERIVATIVES WITH OR WITHOUT HEDGE ACCOUNTING DESIGNATION THAT UTILIZE WARRANTS, EQUITY OPTIONS, OR OTHER EQUITY DERIVATIVES.

WE RECOGNIZE CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF SUCH DERIVATIVES IN GAINS (LOSSES) ON EQUITY INVESTMENTS, NET.

WE ALSO UTILIZE TOTAL RETURN SWAPS TO OFFSET CHANGES IN LIABILITIES RELATED TO THE EQUITY MARKET RISKS OF CERTAIN DEFERRED COMPENSATION ARRANGEMENTS. GAINS AND LOSSES FROM CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THESE TOTAL RETURN SWAPS ARE GENERALLY OFFSET BY THE LOSSES AND GAINS ON THE RELATED LIABILITIES

, BOTH OF WHICH ARE RECORDED IN EITHER COST OF SALES OR OPERATING EXPENSES. DEFERRED COMPENSATION LIABILITIES WERE

$1.2 BILLION

AS OF

DECEMBER 27, 2014

(

$1.1 BILLION

AS OF

), AND ARE INCLUDED IN OTHER ACCRUED LIABILITIES.

COMMODITY PRICE RISK

WE OPERATE FACILITIES THAT CONSUME COMMODITIES AND HAVE ESTABLISHED FORECASTED TRANSACTION RISK MANAGEMENT PROGRAMS TO PROTECT AGAINST FLUCTUATIONS IN THE FAIR VALUE AND THE VOLATILITY OF FUTURE CASH FLOWS CAUSED BY CHANGES IN COMMODITY PRICES, SUCH AS THOSE FOR NATURAL GAS. THESE PROGRAMS REDUCE, BUT DO NOT ALWAYS ELIMINATE, THE IMPACT OF COMMODITY PRICE MOVEMENTS.

OUR COMMODITY PRICE RISK MANAGEMENT PROGRAM INCLUDES COMMODITY DERIVATIVES WITH CASH FLOW HEDGE ACCOUNTING DESIGNATION THAT UTILIZE COMMODITY SWAP CONTRACTS TO HEDGE FUTURE CASH FLOW EXPOSURES TO THE VARIABILITY IN COMMODITY PRICES.

THESE INSTRUMENTS GENERALLY MATURE WITHIN

12 MONTHS

NOTE 7: CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS THAT POTENTIALLY SUBJECT US TO CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK CONSIST PRINCIPALLY OF INVESTMENTS IN DEBT INSTRUMENTS, DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, LOANS RECEIVABLE, AND TRADE RECEIVABLES.

WHEN POSSIBLE, WE ENTER INTO MASTER NETTING ARRANGEMENTS WITH COUNTERPARTIES TO MITIGATE CREDIT RISK IN DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS. A MASTER NETTING ARRANGEMENT MAY ALLOW COUNTERPARTIES TO NET SETTLE AMOUNTS OWED TO EACH OTHER AS A RESULT OF MULTIPLE, SEPARATE DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS.

FOR PRESENTATION ON OUR CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS, WE DO NOT OFFSET FAIR VALUE AMOUNTS RECOGNIZED FOR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS UNDER MASTER NETTING ARRANGEMENTS.

WE GENERALLY PLACE INVESTMENTS WITH HIGH-CREDIT-QUALITY COUNTERPARTIES AND, BY POLICY, WE LIMIT THE AMOUNT OF CREDIT EXPOSURE TO ANY ONE COUNTERPARTY BASED ON OUR ANALYSIS OF THAT COUNTERPARTY’S RELATIVE CREDIT STANDING.

MOST

OF OUR INVESTMENTS IN DEBT INSTRUMENTS ARE IN

A/A2 OR BETTER

RATED ISSUANCES, AND

THE MAJORITY

OF THE ISSUANCES ARE RATED

AA-/AA3 OR BETTER

. OUR INVESTMENT POLICY REQUIRES SUBSTANTIALLY ALL INVESTMENTS WITH ORIGINAL MATURITIES AT THE TIME OF INVESTMENT OF UP TO SIX MONTHS TO BE RATED AT LEAST A-2/P-2 BY STANDARD & POOR’S/MOODY’S, AND SPECIFIES A HIGHER MINIMUM RATING FOR INVESTMENTS WITH LONGER MATURITIES. FOR INSTANCE, INVESTMENTS WITH MATURITIES OF GREATER THAN THREE YEARS GENERALLY REQUIRE A MINIMUM RATING OF AA-/AA3 AT THE TIME OF INVESTMENT. GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS IMPOSED ON INVESTMENT ALTERNATIVES OF OUR NON-U.S. SUBSIDIARIES, OR THE ABSENCE OF A-RATED COUNTERPARTIES IN CERTAIN COUNTRIES, RESULT IN SOME MINOR EXCEPTIONS. CREDIT-RATING CRITERIA FOR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS ARE SIMILAR TO THOSE FOR OTHER INVESTMENTS. DUE TO MASTER NETTING ARRANGEMENTS, THE AMOUNTS SUBJECT TO CREDIT RISK RELATED TO DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS ARE GENERALLY LIMITED TO THE AMOUNTS, IF ANY, BY WHICH THE COUNTERPARTY’S OBLIGATIONS EXCEED OUR OBLIGATIONS WITH THAT COUNTERPARTY. AS OF

DECEMBER 27, 2014

, OUR TOTAL CREDIT EXPOSURE TO ANY SINGLE COUNTERPARTY DID NOT EXCEED

$750 MILLION

. WE OBTAIN AND SECURE AVAILABLE COLLATERAL FROM COUNTERPARTIES AGAINST OBLIGATIONS, INCLUDING SECURITIES LENDING TRANSACTIONS, WHEN WE DEEM IT APPROPRIATE.

A SUBSTANTIAL MAJORITY OF OUR TRADE RECEIVABLES ARE DERIVED FROM SALES TO

ORIGINAL EQUIPMENT MANUFACTURERS

AND

ORIGINAL DESIGN MANUFACTURERS

. WE ALSO HAVE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE DERIVED FROM SALES TO

INDUSTRIAL AND COMMUNICATIONS EQUIPMENT MANUFACTURERS IN THE COMPUTING AND COMMUNICATIONS INDUSTRIES

. OUR THREE LARGEST CUSTOMERS ACCOUNTED FOR

46%

OF NET REVENUE FOR

2014

(

44%

FOR

2013

AND

43%

FOR

2012

). THESE THREE CUSTOMERS ACCOUNTED FOR

43%

OF NET ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AS OF

DECEMBER 27, 2014

(

34%

AS OF

DECEMBER 28, 2013

). WE BELIEVE THAT THE NET ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE BALANCES FROM THESE LARGEST CUSTOMERS DO NOT REPRESENT A SIGNIFICANT CREDIT RISK, BASED ON CASH FLOW FORECASTS, BALANCE SHEET ANALYSIS, AND PAST COLLECTION EXPERIENCE.

WE HAVE ADOPTED CREDIT POLICIES AND STANDARDS INTENDED TO ACCOMMODATE INDUSTRY GROWTH AND INHERENT RISK. WE BELIEVE THAT CREDIT RISKS ARE MODERATED BY THE FINANCIAL STABILITY OF OUR MAJOR CUSTOMERS.

WE ASSESS CREDIT RISK THROUGH QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE ANALYSIS. FROM THIS ANALYSIS, WE ESTABLISH SHIPPING AND CREDIT LIMITS, AND DETERMINE WHETHER WE WILL SEEK TO USE ONE OR MORE CREDIT SUPPORT DEVICES, SUCH AS OBTAINING A PARENT GUARANTEE, STANDBY LETTER OF CREDIT, OR CREDIT INSURANCE.

DURING 2014, WE FORMED THE INTERNET OF THINGS GROUP (IOTG) AND WE CHANGED OUR ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE TO ALIGN WITH OUR CRITICAL OBJECTIVES, WHICH INCLUDED THE ADDITION OF THE MOBILE AND COMMUNICATIONS GROUP (MCG) AS A REPORTABLE OPERATING SEGMENT. DUE TO THIS REORGANIZATION, GOODWILL WAS ALLOCATED FROM OUR PRIOR REPORTING UNITS TO OUR NEW REPORTING UNITS, AS SHOWN IN THE PRECEDING TABLE WITHIN "TRANSFERS." THE ALLOCATION WAS BASED ON THE FAIR VALUE OF EACH BUSINESS GROUP WITHIN ITS ORIGINAL REPORTING UNIT RELATIVE TO THE FAIR VALUE OF THAT REPORTING UNIT.

DURING 2013, WE COMPLETED A REORGANIZATION THAT TRANSFERRED A PORTION OF OUR WIRED CONNECTIVITY BUSINESS FORMERLY INCLUDED WITHIN THE DATA CENTER GROUP (DCG) TO THE PC CLIENT GROUP (PCCG). DUE TO THIS REORGANIZATION, GOODWILL WAS TRANSFERRED FROM DCG TO PCCG. ALSO DURING 2013, WE COMPLETED A REORGANIZATION OF INTEL MOBILE COMMUNICATIONS (IMC) INTO OUR MULTI-COMM AND EXISTING PHONE GROUP OPERATING SEGMENTS. GOODWILL RELATED TO THE FORMER IMC WAS ALLOCATED BETWEEN MULTI-COMM AND THE PHONE GROUP WITHIN THE "OTHER INTEL ARCHITECTURE" OPERATING SEGMENTS.

NOTE 16: RETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS

RETIREMENT CONTRIBUTION PLANS

WE PROVIDE TAX-QUALIFIED RETIREMENT CONTRIBUTION PLANS FOR THE BENEFIT OF ELIGIBLE EMPLOYEES, FORMER EMPLOYEES, AND RETIREES IN THE U.S. AND CERTAIN OTHER COUNTRIES. THE PLANS ARE DESIGNED TO PROVIDE EMPLOYEES WITH AN ACCUMULATION OF FUNDS FOR RETIREMENT ON A TAX-DEFERRED BASIS. EMPLOYEES HIRED PRIOR TO JANUARY 1, 2011 ARE ELIGIBLE FOR AND RECEIVE DISCRETIONARY EMPLOYER CONTRIBUTIONS IN THE U.S. INTEL RETIREMENT CONTRIBUTION PLAN. EMPLOYEES HIRED ON OR AFTER JANUARY 1, 2011 RECEIVE DISCRETIONARY EMPLOYER CONTRIBUTIONS IN THE INTEL 401(K) SAVINGS PLAN, WHICH ARE PARTICIPANT-DIRECTED. OUR CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER (CEO) DETERMINES THE ANNUAL DISCRETIONARY EMPLOYER CONTRIBUTION AMOUNTS FOR THE U.S. INTEL RETIREMENT CONTRIBUTION PLAN AND THE INTEL 401(K) SAVINGS PLAN UNDER DELEGATION OF AUTHORITY FROM OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS, PURSUANT TO THE TERMS OF THE PLANS. AS OF

DECEMBER 27, 2014

,

84%

OF OUR U.S. INTEL RETIREMENT CONTRIBUTION PLAN ASSETS WERE INVESTED IN EQUITIES AND

16%

WERE INVESTED IN FIXED-INCOME INSTRUMENTS. THESE ASSETS ARE MANAGED BY EXTERNAL INVESTMENT MANAGERS. EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2015, THE U.S. INTEL RETIREMENT CONTRIBUTION PLAN ASSETS AND FUTURE DISCRETIONARY EMPLOYER CONTRIBUTIONS WILL BE PARTICIPANT-DIRECTED.

FOR THE BENEFIT OF ELIGIBLE U.S. EMPLOYEES, WE ALSO PROVIDE A NON-TAX-QUALIFIED SUPPLEMENTAL DEFERRED COMPENSATION PLAN FOR CERTAIN HIGHLY COMPENSATED EMPLOYEES. THIS PLAN IS DESIGNED TO PERMIT CERTAIN DISCRETIONARY EMPLOYER CONTRIBUTIONS AND TO PERMIT EMPLOYEE DEFERRAL OF A PORTION OF COMPENSATION IN ADDITION TO THEIR INTEL 401(K) SAVINGS PLAN DEFERRALS. THIS PLAN IS UNFUNDED.

WE EXPENSED

$286 MILLION

FOR THE QUALIFIED AND NON-QUALIFIED U.S. RETIREMENT CONTRIBUTION PLANS IN

2014

(

$298 MILLION

IN

2013

AND

, WE FUNDED

PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS

U.S. PENSION BENEFITS.

FOR EMPLOYEES HIRED PRIOR TO JANUARY 1, 2011, WE PROVIDE A TAX-QUALIFIED DEFINED-BENEFIT PENSION PLAN, THE U.S. INTEL MINIMUM PENSION PLAN, FOR ELIGIBLE EMPLOYEES, FORMER EMPLOYEES, AND RETIREES IN THE U.S. DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2014, WE COMMUNICATED TO EMPLOYEES OUR INTENT, BEGINNING ON JANUARY 1, 2015, TO FREEZE FUTURE BENEFIT ACCRUALS IN THE U.S. INTEL MINIMUM PENSION PLAN TO ALL EMPLOYEES AT OR ABOVE A SPECIFIC GRADE LEVEL, AND GENERALLY COVERING ALL HIGHLY COMPENSATED EMPLOYEES IN THE PLAN. STARTING IN 2016, THE IMPACTED EMPLOYEES WILL RECEIVE DISCRETIONARY EMPLOYER CONTRIBUTIONS IN THE INTEL 401(K) SAVINGS PLAN, INSTEAD OF THE RETIREMENT CONTRIBUTION PLAN. THIS CHANGE WAS CONTINGENT ON RECEIVING A FAVORABLE PRIVATE LETTER RULING (PLR) FROM THE U.S. INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE (IRS), WHICH WE FILED FOR IN JANUARY 2014. A FAVORABLE PLR WAS RECEIVED IN OCTOBER 2014 AND RESULTED IN A

$1.1 BILLION

REDUCTION IN OUR PROJECTED BENEFIT OBLIGATION, MOST OF WHICH WAS ALSO INCLUDED AS A CHANGE IN ACTUARIAL VALUATION ON THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF COMPREHENSIVE INCOME.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

INTEL CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

THE U.S. INTEL MINIMUM PENSION PLAN BENEFIT IS DETERMINED BY A PARTICIPANT’S YEARS OF SERVICE AND FINAL AVERAGE COMPENSATION AS DEFINED BY THE PLAN DOCUMENT. THE PLAN GENERATES A MINIMUM PENSION BENEFIT IF THE PARTICIPANTS’ U.S. INTEL MINIMUM PENSION PLAN BENEFIT EXCEEDS THE ANNUITIZED VALUE OF THEIR U.S. INTEL RETIREMENT CONTRIBUTION PLAN BENEFIT. IF PARTICIPANT BALANCES IN THE U.S. INTEL RETIREMENT CONTRIBUTION PLAN DO NOT GROW SUFFICIENTLY, THE PROJECTED BENEFIT OBLIGATION OF THE U.S. INTEL MINIMUM PENSION PLAN COULD INCREASE SIGNIFICANTLY. CONSISTENT WITH APPLICABLE LAW, ASSETS OF THE U.S. INTEL MINIMUM PENSION PLAN ARE HELD IN TRUST, SOLELY FOR THE BENEFIT OF PLAN PARTICIPANTS, AND ARE NOT AVAILABLE FOR GENERAL CORPORATE PURPOSES.

NON-U.S. PENSION BENEFITS.

WE ALSO PROVIDE DEFINED-BENEFIT PENSION PLANS IN CERTAIN OTHER COUNTRIES, MOST SIGNIFICANTLY GERMANY, IRELAND, AND ISRAEL. CONSISTENT WITH THE REQUIREMENTS OF LOCAL LAW, WE DEPOSIT FUNDS FOR CERTAIN PLANS WITH INSURANCE COMPANIES, WITH THIRD-PARTY TRUSTEES, OR INTO GOVERNMENT-MANAGED ACCOUNTS, AND/OR ACCRUE FOR THE UNFUNDED PORTION OF THE OBLIGATION. THE IRELAND PENSION PLAN AND ONE OF OUR GERMANY PENSION PLANS WERE CLOSED TO EMPLOYEES HIRED ON OR AFTER JUNE 20, 2012 AND JANUARY 1, 2014, RESPECTIVELY.

U.S. POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL BENEFITS.

UPON RETIREMENT, ELIGIBLE U.S. EMPLOYEES WHO WERE HIRED PRIOR TO JANUARY 1, 2014 ARE CREDITED WITH A DEFINED DOLLAR AMOUNT, BASED ON YEARS OF SERVICE, INTO A U.S. SHELTERED EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT MEDICAL ACCOUNT (SERMA). THESE CREDITS CAN BE USED TO PAY ALL OR A PORTION OF THE COST TO PURCHASE COVERAGE IN THE RETIREE’S CHOICE OF MEDICAL PLAN. IF THE AVAILABLE CREDITS ARE NOT SUFFICIENT TO PAY THE ENTIRE COST OF THE COVERAGE, THE REMAINING COST IS THE RETIREE’S RESPONSIBILITY. EMPLOYEES HIRED ON OR AFTER JANUARY 1, 2014 ARE NOT ELIGIBLE TO EARN A SERMA BENEFIT.

FUNDING POLICY.

OUR PRACTICE IS TO FUND THE VARIOUS PENSION PLANS AND THE U.S. POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL BENEFITS PLAN IN AMOUNTS SUFFICIENT TO MEET THE MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS OF APPLICABLE LOCAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS. ADDITIONAL FUNDING MAY BE PROVIDED AS DEEMED APPROPRIATE. DEPENDING ON THE DESIGN OF THE PLAN, LOCAL CUSTOMS, AND MARKET CIRCUMSTANCES, THE LIABILITIES OF A PLAN MAY EXCEED QUALIFIED PLAN ASSETS.

FOR THE U.S. PLANS, WE DEVELOPED THE DISCOUNT RATE BY CALCULATING THE BENEFIT PAYMENT STREAMS BY YEAR TO DETERMINE WHEN BENEFIT PAYMENTS WILL BE DUE. WE THEN MATCHED THE BENEFIT PAYMENT STREAMS BY YEAR TO THE AA CORPORATE BOND RATES TO MATCH THE TIMING AND AMOUNT OF THE EXPECTED BENEFIT PAYMENTS AND DISCOUNTED BACK TO THE MEASUREMENT DATE TO DETERMINE THE APPROPRIATE DISCOUNT RATE. FOR THE NON-U.S. PLANS, WE USED TWO APPROACHES TO DEVELOP THE DISCOUNT RATE. IN CERTAIN COUNTRIES, WE USED A MODEL CONSISTING OF A THEORETICAL BOND PORTFOLIO FOR WHICH THE TIMING AND AMOUNT OF CASH FLOWS APPROXIMATED THE ESTIMATED BENEFIT PAYMENTS OF OUR PENSION PLANS. IN OTHER COUNTRIES, WE ANALYZED CURRENT MARKET LONG-TERM BOND RATES AND MATCHED THE BOND MATURITY WITH THE AVERAGE DURATION OF THE PENSION LIABILITIES.

THE EXPECTED LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS ASSUMPTIONS TAKES INTO CONSIDERATION BOTH DURATION AND RISK OF THE INVESTMENT PORTFOLIOS, AND IS DEVELOPED THROUGH CONSENSUS AND BUILDING-BLOCK METHODOLOGIES. THE CONSENSUS METHODOLOGY INCLUDES UNADJUSTED ESTIMATES BY THE FUND MANAGER ON FUTURE MARKET EXPECTATIONS BY BROAD ASSET CLASSES AND GEOGRAPHY. THE BUILDING-BLOCK APPROACH DETERMINES THE RATES OF RETURN IMPLIED BY HISTORICAL RISK PREMIUMS ACROSS ASSET CLASSES. IN ADDITION, WE ANALYZE RATES OF RETURN RELEVANT TO THE COUNTRY WHERE EACH PLAN IS IN EFFECT AND THE INVESTMENTS APPLICABLE TO THE PLAN, EXPECTATIONS OF FUTURE RETURNS, LOCAL ACTUARIAL PROJECTIONS, AND THE PROJECTED LONG-TERM RATES OF RETURN FROM EXTERNAL INVESTMENT MANAGERS. THE EXPECTED LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS SHOWN FOR THE NON-U.S. PLAN ASSETS IS WEIGHTED TO REFLECT EACH COUNTRY’S RELATIVE PORTION OF THE NON-U.S. PLAN ASSETS.

NET PERIODIC BENEFIT COST

IN

2014

, THE NET PERIODIC BENEFIT COST FOR U.S. PENSION BENEFITS, NON-U.S. PENSION BENEFITS, AND U.S. POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL BENEFITS WAS

$36 MILLION

(

$230 MILLION

IN

2013

AND

$210 MILLION

IN

2012

),

$165 MILLION

(

$116 MILLION

IN

2012

) AND

$17 MILLION

(

$77 MILLION

IN

2013

AND

$50 MILLION

IN

2012

), RESPECTIVELY.

THE DECREASE IN THE U.S. NET PERIODIC PENSION BENEFIT COST COMPARED TO 2013 IS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTED TO THE ONE-TIME CURTAILMENT GAIN RELATED TO THE FREEZE OF FUTURE BENEFIT ACCRUALS AND LOWER RECOGNIZED NET ACTUARIAL LOSSES.

U.S. PENSION PLAN ASSETS

IN GENERAL, THE INVESTMENT STRATEGY FOR U.S. INTEL MINIMUM PENSION PLAN ASSETS IS TO MAXIMIZE RISK-ADJUSTED RETURNS, TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION THE INVESTMENT HORIZON AND EXPECTED VOLATILITY, TO ENSURE THAT THERE ARE SUFFICIENT ASSETS AVAILABLE TO PAY PENSION BENEFITS AS THEY COME DUE. THE ALLOCATION TO EACH ASSET CLASS WILL FLUCTUATE WITH MARKET CONDITIONS, SUCH AS VOLATILITY AND LIQUIDITY CONCERNS, AND WILL TYPICALLY BE REBALANCED WHEN OUTSIDE THE TARGET RANGES, WHICH ARE

55%

FOR EQUITY INVESTMENTS AND

45%

FOR FIXED-INCOME INVESTMENTS IN

2014

. THE EXPECTED LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN FOR THE U.S. INTEL MINIMUM PENSION PLAN ASSETS IS

6.1%.

NON-U.S. PLAN ASSETS

THE INVESTMENTS OF THE NON-U.S. PLANS ARE MANAGED BY INSURANCE COMPANIES, PENSION FUNDS, OR THIRD-PARTY TRUSTEES, CONSISTENT WITH REGULATIONS OR MARKET PRACTICE OF THE COUNTRY WHERE THE ASSETS ARE INVESTED. THE INVESTMENT MANAGER MAKES INVESTMENT DECISIONS WITHIN THE GUIDELINES SET BY INTEL OR LOCAL REGULATIONS. THE INVESTMENT MANAGER EVALUATES PERFORMANCE BY COMPARING THE ACTUAL RATE OF RETURN TO THE RETURN ON SIMILAR ASSETS. INVESTMENTS MANAGED BY QUALIFIED INSURANCE COMPANIES OR PENSION FUNDS UNDER STANDARD CONTRACTS FOLLOW LOCAL REGULATIONS, AND WE ARE NOT ACTIVELY INVOLVED IN THEIR INVESTMENT STRATEGIES. FOR THE ASSETS THAT WE HAVE DISCRETION TO SET INVESTMENT GUIDELINES, THE ASSETS ARE INVESTED IN DEVELOPED COUNTRY EQUITY INVESTMENTS AND FIXED-INCOME INVESTMENTS, EITHER THROUGH INDEX FUNDS OR DIRECT INVESTMENT. IN GENERAL, THE INVESTMENT STRATEGY IS DESIGNED TO ACCUMULATE A DIVERSIFIED PORTFOLIO AMONG MARKETS, ASSET CLASSES, OR INDIVIDUAL SECURITIES TO REDUCE MARKET RISK AND TO ENSURE THAT THE PENSION ASSETS ARE AVAILABLE TO PAY BENEFITS AS THEY COME DUE. THE TARGET ALLOCATION OF THE NON-U.S. PLAN ASSETS THAT WE HAVE CONTROL OVER IS

U.S. POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL PLAN ASSETS

IN GENERAL, THE INVESTMENT STRATEGY FOR U.S. POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL BENEFITS PLAN ASSETS IS TO INVEST PRIMARILY IN LIQUID ASSETS DUE TO THE LEVEL OF EXPECTED FUTURE BENEFIT PAYMENTS. THE ASSETS ARE INVESTED SOLELY IN A TAX-AWARE GLOBAL EQUITY PORTFOLIO, WHICH IS ACTIVELY MANAGED BY AN EXTERNAL INVESTMENT MANAGER. THE TAX-AWARE GLOBAL EQUITY PORTFOLIO IS COMPRISED OF A DIVERSIFIED MIX OF EQUITIES IN DEVELOPED COUNTRIES, INCLUDING THE U.S., AND EMERGING MARKETS THROUGHOUT THE WORLD. THE EXPECTED LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN FOR THE U.S. POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL BENEFITS PLAN ASSETS IS

7.4%

. AS OF

DECEMBER 27, 2014

,

SUBSTANTIALLY ALL

OF THE U.S. POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL BENEFITS PLAN ASSETS WERE INVESTED IN EXCHANGE-TRADED EQUITY SECURITIES AND WERE MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE USING LEVEL 1 INPUTS.

CONCENTRATIONS OF RISK

WE MANAGE A VARIETY OF RISKS, INCLUDING CREDIT, LIQUIDITY, AND MARKET RISKS, ACROSS OUR PLAN ASSETS THROUGH OUR INVESTMENT MANAGERS. WE DEFINE A CONCENTRATION OF RISK AS AN UNDIVERSIFIED EXPOSURE TO ONE OF THE AFOREMENTIONED RISKS THAT UNNECESSARILY INCREASES THE EXPOSURE TO A LOSS OF PLAN ASSETS. WE MONITOR EXPOSURE TO SUCH RISKS IN BOTH THE U.S. AND NON-U.S. PLANS BY MONITORING THE MAGNITUDE OF THE RISK IN EACH PLAN AND DIVERSIFYING OUR EXPOSURE TO SUCH RISKS ACROSS A VARIETY OF COUNTERPARTIES, INSTRUMENTS, AND MARKETS. AS OF

DECEMBER 27, 2014

, WE DID NOT HAVE CONCENTRATIONS OF RISK IN ANY SINGLE ENTITY, MANAGER, COUNTERPARTY, SECTOR, INDUSTRY, OR COUNTRY.

FUNDING EXPECTATIONS

UNDER APPLICABLE LAW FOR THE U.S. INTEL MINIMUM PENSION PLAN AND THE U.S. POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL BENEFITS PLAN, WE ARE NOT REQUIRED TO MAKE ANY CONTRIBUTIONS DURING

UNDER THE 2006 EQUITY INCENTIVE PLAN (THE 2006 PLAN),

719 MILLION

SHARES OF COMMON STOCK ARE AVAILABLE FOR ISSUANCE AS EQUITY AWARDS TO EMPLOYEES AND NON-EMPLOYEE DIRECTORS THROUGH JUNE 2016. A MAXIMUM OF

517 MILLION

OF THESE SHARES OF COMMON STOCK CAN BE GRANTED AS RESTRICTED STOCK OR RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS. AS OF

DECEMBER 27, 2014

,

258 MILLION

SHARES OF COMMON STOCK REMAINED AVAILABLE FOR FUTURE GRANT UNDER THE 2006 PLAN.

GOING FORWARD, WE MAY ASSUME THE EQUITY INCENTIVE PLANS AND THE OUTSTANDING EQUITY AWARDS OF CERTAIN ACQUIRED COMPANIES. ONCE THEY ARE ASSUMED, WE DO NOT GRANT ADDITIONAL SHARES OF COMMON STOCK UNDER THOSE PLANS. THE STOCK OPTIONS AND RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS ISSUED GENERALLY RETAIN SIMILAR TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THE RESPECTIVE PLAN UNDER WHICH THEY WERE ORIGINALLY GRANTED.

WE ISSUE RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS WITH BOTH A MARKET CONDITION AND A SERVICE CONDITION (MARKET-BASED RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS), REFERRED TO IN OUR

2014

PROXY STATEMENT AS OUTPERFORMANCE STOCK UNITS, TO A SMALL GROUP OF SENIOR OFFICERS AND NON-EMPLOYEE DIRECTORS. FOR MARKET-BASED RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS ISSUED IN

0%

TO

200%

OF THE TARGET AMOUNT, BASED ON TOTAL STOCKHOLDER RETURN (TSR) ON OUR COMMON STOCK MEASURED AGAINST THE BENCHMARK TSR OF A PEER GROUP OVER A

THREE

DECEMBER 27, 2014

,

4 MILLION

MARKET-BASED RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS WERE OUTSTANDING. THESE MARKET-BASED RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS ACCRUE DIVIDEND EQUIVALENTS AND GENERALLY VEST THREE YEARS AND ONE MONTH FROM THE GRANT DATE.

EQUITY AWARDS GRANTED TO EMPLOYEES IN

THE 2006 STOCK PURCHASE PLAN ALLOWS ELIGIBLE EMPLOYEES TO PURCHASE SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK AT

85%

OF THE VALUE OF OUR COMMON STOCK ON SPECIFIC DATES. UNDER THE 2006 STOCK PURCHASE PLAN,

373 MILLION

SHARES OF COMMON STOCK ARE AVAILABLE FOR ISSUANCE THROUGH AUGUST 2016. AS OF

WE RECEIVED COLLATERAL FROM THE COUNTERPARTY FOR THE VALUE ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE FORWARD PORTION OF THIS CONTRACT AND INVESTED THE COLLATERAL INTO PERMITTED INVESTMENTS CONSIDERED RESTRICTED FROM OTHER USES. AS OF DECEMBER 27, 2014,

$325 MILLION

OF COLLATERAL, WHICH APPROXIMATES FAIR VALUE, REMAINS RECORDED AS BOTH A CURRENT ASSET AND CURRENT LIABILITY ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET. THE

$325 MILLION

REPRESENTS THE UNSETTLED PORTION OF THE CONTRACT AND WILL BE RETURNED TO THE COUNTERPARTY BY DECEMBER 29, 2014, THE SETTLEMENT DATE.

RESTRICTED STOCK UNIT WITHHOLDINGS

WE ISSUE RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS AS PART OF OUR EQUITY INCENTIVE PLANS.

FOR THE MAJORITY OF RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS GRANTED, THE NUMBER OF SHARES OF COMMON STOCK ISSUED ON THE DATE THE RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS VEST IS NET OF THE MINIMUM STATUTORY WITHHOLDING REQUIREMENTS THAT WE PAY IN CASH TO THE APPROPRIATE TAXING AUTHORITIES ON BEHALF OF OUR EMPLOYEES.

IN OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, WE ALSO TREAT SHARES OF COMMON STOCK WITHHELD FOR TAX PURPOSES ON BEHALF OF OUR EMPLOYEES IN CONNECTION WITH THE VESTING OF RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS AS COMMON STOCK REPURCHASES BECAUSE THEY REDUCE THE NUMBER OF SHARES THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN ISSUED UPON VESTING. THESE WITHHELD SHARES ARE NOT CONSIDERED COMMON STOCK REPURCHASES UNDER OUR AUTHORIZED COMMON STOCK REPURCHASE PLAN

WE COMPUTED DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE OF COMMON STOCK USING NET INCOME AVAILABLE TO COMMON STOCKHOLDERS AND THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE NUMBER OF SHARES OF COMMON STOCK OUTSTANDING PLUS POTENTIALLY DILUTIVE SHARES OF COMMON STOCK OUTSTANDING DURING THE PERIOD. NET INCOME AVAILABLE TO PARTICIPATING SECURITIES WAS

INSIGNIFICANT

FOR ALL PERIODS PRESENTED.

POTENTIALLY DILUTIVE SHARES OF COMMON STOCK FROM EMPLOYEE INCENTIVE PLANS ARE DETERMINED BY APPLYING THE TREASURY STOCK METHOD TO THE ASSUMED EXERCISE OF OUTSTANDING STOCK OPTIONS, THE ASSUMED VESTING OF OUTSTANDING RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS, AND THE ASSUMED ISSUANCE OF COMMON STOCK UNDER THE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN. POTENTIALLY DILUTIVE SHARES OF COMMON STOCK FOR OUR 2005 DEBENTURES ARE DETERMINED BY APPLYING THE IF-CONVERTED METHOD. HOWEVER, AS OUR 2009 DEBENTURES REQUIRE SETTLEMENT OF THE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF THE DEBT IN CASH UPON CONVERSION, WITH THE CONVERSION PREMIUM PAID IN CASH OR STOCK AT OUR OPTION, POTENTIALLY DILUTIVE SHARES OF COMMON STOCK ARE DETERMINED BY APPLYING THE TREASURY STOCK METHOD. FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION ON THE SPECIFIC CONVERSION FEATURES OF OUR 2005 AND 2009 DEBENTURES, SEE "

NOTE 15: BORROWINGS

."

IN

2014

, WE EXCLUDED ON AVERAGE

10 MILLION

OUTSTANDING STOCK OPTIONS AND RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS FROM THE COMPUTATION OF DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE OF COMMON STOCK BECAUSE THESE SHARES OF COMMON STOCK WOULD HAVE BEEN ANTI-DILUTIVE (

55 MILLION

IN

2013

AND

29 MILLION

IN

2012

). THESE OPTIONS COULD POTENTIALLY BE INCLUDED IN THE DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE OF COMMON STOCK CALCULATION IN THE FUTURE IF THE AVERAGE MARKET VALUE OF THE SHARES OF COMMON STOCK INCREASES AND IS GREATER THAN THE EXERCISE PRICE OF THESE OPTIONS.

IN ALL YEARS PRESENTED, WE INCLUDED OUR 2009 DEBENTURES IN THE CALCULATION OF DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE OF COMMON STOCK BECAUSE THE AVERAGE MARKET PRICE WAS ABOVE THE CONVERSION PRICE. WE COULD POTENTIALLY EXCLUDE THE 2009 DEBENTURES IN THE FUTURE IF THE AVERAGE MARKET PRICE IS BELOW THE CONVERSION PRICE.

ALTHOUGH MANAGEMENT AT PRESENT BELIEVES THAT THE ULTIMATE OUTCOME OF THESE PROCEEDINGS, INDIVIDUALLY AND IN THE AGGREGATE, WILL NOT MATERIALLY HARM OUR FINANCIAL POSITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, CASH FLOWS, OR OVERALL TRENDS, LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND RELATED GOVERNMENT INVESTIGATIONS ARE SUBJECT TO INHERENT UNCERTAINTIES, AND UNFAVORABLE RULINGS OR OTHER EVENTS COULD OCCUR. UNFAVORABLE RESOLUTIONS COULD INCLUDE SUBSTANTIAL MONETARY DAMAGES.

GOVERNMENT COMPETITION MATTERS AND RELATED CONSUMER CLASS ACTIONS

A NUMBER OF PROCEEDINGS GENERALLY HAVE CHALLENGED AND CONTINUE TO CHALLENGE CERTAIN OF OUR COMPETITIVE PRACTICES. THE ALLEGATIONS IN THESE PROCEEDINGS VARY AND ARE DESCRIBED IN MORE DETAIL IN THE FOLLOWING PARAGRAPHS. IN GENERAL, THEY CONTEND THAT WE IMPROPERLY CONDITIONED PRICE REBATES AND OTHER DISCOUNTS ON OUR MICROPROCESSORS ON EXCLUSIVE OR NEAR-EXCLUSIVE DEALING BY SOME OF OUR CUSTOMERS; AND THEY ALLEGE THAT OUR SOFTWARE COMPILER BUSINESS UNFAIRLY PREFERRED INTEL

®

MICROPROCESSORS OVER COMPETING MICROPROCESSORS AND THAT, THROUGH THE USE OF OUR COMPILERS AND OTHER MEANS, WE HAVE CAUSED THE DISSEMINATION OF INACCURATE AND MISLEADING BENCHMARK RESULTS CONCERNING OUR MICROPROCESSORS. BASED ON THE PROCEDURAL POSTURE OF THE VARIOUS REMAINING COMPETITION MATTERS, WHICH WE DESCRIBE IN THE FOLLOWING PARAGRAPHS, OUR INVESTMENT OF RESOURCES TO EXPLAIN AND DEFEND OUR POSITION HAS DECLINED AS COMPARED TO THE PERIOD 2005-2011. NONETHELESS, CERTAIN OF THE MATTERS REMAIN ACTIVE, AND THESE CHALLENGES COULD CONTINUE FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS, POTENTIALLY REQUIRING US TO INVEST ADDITIONAL RESOURCES. WE BELIEVE THAT WE COMPETE LAWFULLY AND THAT OUR MARKETING, BUSINESS, INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, AND OTHER CHALLENGED PRACTICES BENEFIT OUR CUSTOMERS AND OUR STOCKHOLDERS, AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO CONDUCT A VIGOROUS DEFENSE IN THE REMAINING PROCEEDINGS.

IN 2001, THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION (EC) COMMENCED AN INVESTIGATION REGARDING CLAIMS BY ADVANCED MICRO DEVICES, INC. (AMD) THAT WE USED UNFAIR BUSINESS PRACTICES TO PERSUADE CUSTOMERS TO BUY OUR MICROPROCESSORS. WE RECEIVED NUMEROUS REQUESTS FOR INFORMATION AND DOCUMENTS FROM THE EC AND WE RESPONDED TO EACH OF THOSE REQUESTS. THE EC ISSUED A STATEMENT OF OBJECTIONS IN JULY 2007 AND HELD A HEARING ON THAT STATEMENT IN MARCH 2008. THE EC ISSUED A SUPPLEMENTAL STATEMENT OF OBJECTIONS IN JULY 2008. IN MAY 2009, THE EC ISSUED A DECISION FINDING THAT WE HAD VIOLATED ARTICLE 82 OF THE EC TREATY AND ARTICLE 54 OF THE EUROPEAN ECONOMIC AREA AGREEMENT. IN GENERAL, THE EC FOUND THAT WE VIOLATED ARTICLE 82 (LATER RENUMBERED AS ARTICLE 102 BY A NEW TREATY) BY OFFERING ALLEGED

"

CONDITIONAL REBATES AND PAYMENTS" THAT REQUIRED OUR CUSTOMERS TO PURCHASE ALL OR MOST OF THEIR X86 MICROPROCESSORS FROM US. THE EC ALSO FOUND THAT WE VIOLATED ARTICLE 82 BY MAKING ALLEGED

"

PAYMENTS TO PREVENT SALES OF SPECIFIC RIVAL PRODUCTS." THE EC IMPOSED A FINE IN THE AMOUNT OF

€1.06 BILLION

(

$1.447 BILLION

AS OF MAY 2009), WHICH WE SUBSEQUENTLY PAID DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2009, AND ORDERED US TO "IMMEDIATELY BRING TO AN END THE INFRINGEMENT REFERRED TO IN" THE EC DECISION.

THE EC DECISION CONTAINED NO SPECIFIC DIRECTION ON WHETHER OR HOW WE SHOULD MODIFY OUR BUSINESS PRACTICES. INSTEAD, THE DECISION STATED THAT WE SHOULD "CEASE AND DESIST" FROM FURTHER CONDUCT THAT, IN THE EC'S OPINION, WOULD VIOLATE APPLICABLE LAW. WE TOOK STEPS, WHICH ARE SUBJECT TO THE EC'S ONGOING REVIEW, TO COMPLY WITH THAT DECISION PENDING APPEAL. WE HAD DISCUSSIONS WITH THE EC TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE DECISION AND TO EXPLAIN CHANGES TO OUR BUSINESS PRACTICES.

WE APPEALED THE EC DECISION TO THE COURT OF FIRST INSTANCE (WHICH HAS BEEN RENAMED THE GENERAL COURT) IN JULY 2009. THE HEARING OF OUR APPEAL TOOK PLACE IN JULY 2012. IN JUNE 2014, THE GENERAL COURT REJECTED OUR APPEAL IN ITS ENTIRETY. IN AUGUST 2014, WE FILED AN APPEAL WITH THE EUROPEAN COURT OF JUSTICE. ON NOVEMBER 11, 2014, INTERVENER ASSOCIATION FOR COMPETITIVE TECHNOLOGIES FILED COMMENTS IN SUPPORT OF INTEL’S GROUNDS OF APPEAL. THE EC AND INTERVENERS FILED BRIEFS IN NOVEMBER, AFTER WHICH THE COURT OF JUSTICE IS LIKELY TO ALLOW THE PARTIES TO FILE A FINAL ROUND OF BRIEFS BY FEBRUARY 2015. THE COURT OF JUSTICE IS LIKELY TO HOLD ORAL ARGUMENT IN LATE 2015 AND ISSUE ITS DECISION IN 2016.

AT LEAST 82 SEPARATE CLASS-ACTION LAWSUITS HAVE BEEN FILED IN THE U.S. DISTRICT COURTS FOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA, SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA, DISTRICT OF IDAHO, DISTRICT OF NEBRASKA, DISTRICT OF NEW MEXICO, DISTRICT OF MAINE, AND DISTRICT OF DELAWARE, AS WELL AS IN VARIOUS CALIFORNIA, KANSAS, AND TENNESSEE STATE COURTS. THESE ACTIONS GENERALLY REPEAT THE ALLEGATIONS MADE IN A NOW-SETTLED LAWSUIT FILED AGAINST US BY AMD IN JUNE 2005 IN THE U.S. DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE (AMD LITIGATION). LIKE THE AMD LITIGATION, THESE CLASS-ACTION LAWSUITS ALLEGE THAT WE ENGAGED IN VARIOUS ACTIONS IN VIOLATION OF THE SHERMAN ACT AND OTHER LAWS BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS: PROVIDING DISCOUNTS AND REBATES TO OUR MANUFACTURER AND DISTRIBUTOR CUSTOMERS CONDITIONED ON EXCLUSIVE OR NEAR-EXCLUSIVE DEALING THAT ALLEGEDLY UNFAIRLY INTERFERED WITH AMD

'

S ABILITY TO SELL ITS MICROPROCESSORS; INTERFERING WITH CERTAIN AMD PRODUCT LAUNCHES; AND INTERFERING WITH AMD

'

S PARTICIPATION IN CERTAIN INDUSTRY STANDARDS-SETTING GROUPS. THE CLASS ACTIONS ALLEGE VARIOUS CONSUMER INJURIES, INCLUDING THAT CONSUMERS IN VARIOUS STATES HAVE BEEN INJURED BY PAYING HIGHER PRICES FOR COMPUTERS CONTAINING OUR MICROPROCESSORS. WE DISPUTE THESE CLASS-ACTION CLAIMS AND INTEND TO DEFEND THE LAWSUITS VIGOROUSLY.

ALL OF THE FEDERAL AND STATE CLASS ACTIONS OTHER THAN THE CALIFORNIA CLASS ACTIONS WERE TRANSFERRED BY THE MULTIDISTRICT LITIGATION PANEL TO THE U.S. DISTRICT COURT IN DELAWARE FOR ALL PRE-TRIAL PROCEEDINGS AND DISCOVERY (MDL PROCEEDINGS). THE DELAWARE DISTRICT COURT APPOINTED A SPECIAL MASTER TO ADDRESS ISSUES IN THE MDL PROCEEDINGS, AS ASSIGNED BY THE COURT. IN JANUARY 2010, THE PLAINTIFFS IN THE DELAWARE ACTION FILED A MOTION FOR SANCTIONS FOR OUR ALLEGED FAILURE TO PRESERVE EVIDENCE. THIS MOTION LARGELY COPIES A MOTION PREVIOUSLY FILED BY AMD IN THE AMD LITIGATION, WHICH HAS SETTLED. THE PLAINTIFFS IN THE MDL PROCEEDINGS ALSO MOVED FOR CERTIFICATION OF A CLASS OF MEMBERS WHO PURCHASED CERTAIN PERSONAL COMPUTERS CONTAINING PRODUCTS SOLD BY US. IN JULY 2010, THE SPECIAL MASTER ISSUED A REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION (REPORT) DENYING THE MOTION TO CERTIFY A CLASS. THE MDL PLAINTIFFS FILED OBJECTIONS TO THE SPECIAL MASTER'S REPORT, AND A HEARING ON THOSE OBJECTIONS WAS HELD BEFORE THE DISTRICT COURT IN JULY 2013. IN JULY 2014, THE DISTRICT COURT AFFIRMED THE SPECIAL MASTER'S RULING AND ISSUED AN ORDER DENYING THE MDL PLAINTIFFS' MOTION FOR CLASS CERTIFICATION. IN AUGUST 2014, PLAINTIFFS FILED A PETITION FOR INTERLOCUTORY APPEAL OF THE DISTRICT COURT'S DECISION WITH THE U.S. COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE THIRD CIRCUIT, WHICH THE THIRD CIRCUIT DENIED ON OCTOBER 29, 2014. ON DECEMBER 29, 2014, INTEL FILED A MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT ON THE CLAIMS OF THE REMAINING INDIVIDUAL PLAINTIFFS. THE COURT IS LIKELY TO RULE ON THIS MOTION IN LATE 2015.

ALL CALIFORNIA CLASS ACTIONS HAVE BEEN CONSOLIDATED IN THE SUPERIOR COURT OF CALIFORNIA IN SANTA CLARA COUNTY. THE PLAINTIFFS IN THE CALIFORNIA ACTIONS MOVED FOR CLASS CERTIFICATION, WHICH WE ARE IN THE PROCESS OF OPPOSING. AT OUR REQUEST, THE COURT IN THE CALIFORNIA ACTIONS AGREED TO DELAY RULING ON THIS MOTION UNTIL AFTER THE DELAWARE DISTRICT COURT RULED ON THE SIMILAR MOTION IN THE MDL PROCEEDINGS. THE PLAINTIFFS ASKED THE COURT FOR LEAVE TO RETAIN A NEW EXPERT AND TO AMEND THEIR PREVIOUS MOTION FOR CLASS CERTIFICATION. THE COURT GRANTED PLAINTIFFS’ REQUEST ON FEBRUARY 6, 2015 AND SET THE HEARING ON PLAINTIFFS’ NEW MOTION FOR CLASS CERTIFICATION FOR MAY 29, 2015. GIVEN THE PROCEDURAL POSTURE AND THE NATURE OF THESE CASES, WE ARE UNABLE TO MAKE A REASONABLE ESTIMATE OF THE POTENTIAL LOSS OR RANGE OF LOSSES, IF ANY, ARISING FROM THESE MATTERS.

IN RE HIGH TECH EMPLOYEE ANTITRUST LITIGATION

BETWEEN MAY AND JULY 2011, FORMER EMPLOYEES OF INTEL, ADOBE SYSTEMS INCORPORATED, APPLE INC., GOOGLE INC., INTUIT INC., LUCASFILM LTD., AND PIXAR FILED ANTITRUST CLASS-ACTION LAWSUITS IN THE CALIFORNIA SUPERIOR COURTS ALLEGING THAT THESE COMPANIES HAD ENTERED INTO A CONSPIRACY TO SUPPRESS THE COMPENSATION OF THEIR EMPLOYEES. THE LAWSUITS WERE REMOVED TO THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA AND IN SEPTEMBER 2011 THE PLAINTIFFS FILED A CONSOLIDATED AMENDED COMPLAINT, CAPTIONED

IN RE HIGH TECH EMPLOYEE ANTITRUST LITIGATION

. THE PLAINTIFFS’ ALLEGATIONS REFERENCE THE 2009 AND 2010 INVESTIGATION BY THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE (DOJ) INTO EMPLOYMENT PRACTICES IN THE TECHNOLOGY INDUSTRY, AS WELL AS THE DOJ’S COMPLAINTS AND SUBSEQUENT STIPULATED FINAL JUDGMENTS WITH THE SEVEN COMPANIES NAMED AS DEFENDANTS IN THE LAWSUITS. THE PLAINTIFFS ALLEGE THAT THE DEFENDANTS ENTERED INTO CERTAIN UNLAWFUL AGREEMENTS NOT TO COLD CALL EMPLOYEES OF PARTICULAR OTHER DEFENDANTS AND THAT THERE WAS AN OVERARCHING CONSPIRACY AMONG THE DEFENDANTS. PLAINTIFFS ASSERT ONE SUCH AGREEMENT SPECIFIC TO INTEL, NAMELY THAT INTEL AND GOOGLE ENTERED INTO AN AGREEMENT STARTING IN 2005, NOT TO COLD CALL EACH OTHER'S EMPLOYEES. PLAINTIFFS ASSERT CLAIMS UNDER SECTION 1 OF THE SHERMAN ANTITRUST ACT AND SECTION 4 OF THE CLAYTON ANTITRUST ACT AND SEEK A DECLARATION THAT THE DEFENDANTS’ ALLEGED ACTIONS VIOLATED THE ANTITRUST LAWS, DAMAGES TREBLED AS PROVIDED FOR BY LAW UNDER THE SHERMAN ACT OR CLAYTON ACT, RESTITUTION AND DISGORGEMENT, AND ATTORNEYS’ FEES AND COSTS.

IN OCTOBER 2013, THE DISTRICT COURT CERTIFIED A CLASS CONSISTING OF APPROXIMATELY

65,000

CURRENT OR FORMER EMPLOYEES OF THE SEVEN DEFENDANTS AND SET THE MATTER FOR TRIAL IN LATE MAY 2014. THE SO-CALLED "TECHNICAL CLASS" CONSISTS OF A GROUP OF CURRENT AND FORMER TECHNICAL, CREATIVE, AND R&D EMPLOYEES AT EACH OF THE DEFENDANTS. IN JANUARY 2014, INTEL FILED A MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT, WHICH THE COURT DENIED IN MARCH 2014.

IN APRIL 2014, INTEL, ADOBE, APPLE, AND GOOGLE REACHED AN AGREEMENT WITH PLAINTIFFS TO SETTLE THIS LAWSUIT, BUT IN AUGUST 2014, THE DISTRICT COURT DENIED PRELIMINARY APPROVAL OF THE SETTLEMENT. IN SEPTEMBER 2014, DEFENDANTS FILED A PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS ASKING THE U.S. COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT TO REVERSE THE DISTRICT COURT’S DECISION. THE NINTH CIRCUIT ORDERED BRIEFING AND SCHEDULED A MARCH 2015 HEARING DATE ON THE WRIT PETITION. DEFENDANTS HAVE WITHDRAWN THE PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS IN LIGHT OF THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT DISCUSSED BELOW.

IN JANUARY 2015, INTEL, ADOBE, APPLE, AND GOOGLE REACHED A SECOND AGREEMENT WITH PLAINTIFFS TO SETTLE THIS LAWSUIT, WHICH IS SUBJECT TO COURT APPROVAL. THE COURT HAS SCHEDULED A HEARING ON PLAINTIFFS' MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY APPROVAL FOR MARCH 2015. WE CONTINUE TO DISPUTE THE PLAINTIFFS’ CLAIMS, BUT HAVE AGREED TO SETTLE THIS LAWSUIT TO AVOID THE UNCERTAINTIES, EXPENSES, AND DIVERSION OF RESOURCES FROM CONTINUED LITIGATION. OUR OPERATING EXPENSES FOR 2014 REFLECT ACCRUALS FOR THIS PROCEEDING AND WE BELIEVE REASONABLY POSSIBLE LOSSES IN EXCESS OF THE ACCRUED AMOUNT ARE NOT MATERIAL TO OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

IN MARCH 2014, THE POLICE RETIREMENT SYSTEM OF ST. LOUIS FILED A SHAREHOLDER DERIVATIVE ACTION IN THE SUPERIOR COURT OF CALIFORNIA IN SANTA CLARA COUNTY AGAINST THE MEMBERS OF OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS, CERTAIN FORMER BOARD MEMBERS, AND A CURRENT OFFICER.

LEHMAN BROTHERS HOLDINGS INC. AND LEHMAN BROTHERS OTC DERIVATIVES INC. V. INTEL

IN MAY 2013, LEHMAN BROTHERS OTC DERIVATIVES INC. (LOTC) AND LEHMAN BROTHERS HOLDINGS INC. (LBHI) FILED AN ADVERSARY COMPLAINT IN THE UNITED STATES BANKRUPTCY COURT IN THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK ASSERTING CLAIMS AGAINST US ARISING FROM A 2008 CONTRACT BETWEEN INTEL AND LOTC. UNDER THE TERMS OF THE 2008 CONTRACT, WE PREPAID

$1.0 BILLION

TO LOTC, IN EXCHANGE FOR WHICH LOTC WAS REQUIRED TO DELIVER TO US ON OR BEFORE SEPTEMBER 29, 2008, QUANTITIES OF INTEL COMMON STOCK AND CASH DETERMINED BY A FORMULA SET FORTH IN THE CONTRACT. LOTC'S PERFORMANCE UNDER THE CONTRACT WAS SECURED BY

$1.0 BILLION

OF CASH COLLATERAL. UNDER THE TERMS OF THE CONTRACT, LOTC WAS OBLIGATED TO DELIVER APPROXIMATELY

50 MILLION

SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK TO US ON SEPTEMBER 29, 2008. LOTC FAILED TO DELIVER ANY INTEL COMMON STOCK OR CASH, AND WE EXERCISED OUR RIGHT OF SETOFF AGAINST THE

$1.0 BILLION

COLLATERAL. LOTC AND LBHI ACKNOWLEDGE IN THEIR COMPLAINT THAT WE WERE ENTITLED TO SET OFF OUR LOSSES AGAINST THE COLLATERAL, BUT THEY ASSERT THAT WE WITHHELD COLLATERAL IN EXCESS OF OUR LOSSES THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN RETURNED TO LOTC. THE COMPLAINT ASSERTS A CLAIM FOR BREACH OF CONTRACT, A CLAIM FOR "TURNOVER" UNDER SECTION 542(A) OF THE BANKRUPTCY CODE, AND A CLAIM FOR VIOLATION OF THE AUTOMATIC STAY UNDER SECTION 362(A)(3) OF THE BANKRUPTCY CODE. THE COMPLAINT DOES NOT EXPRESSLY QUANTIFY THE AMOUNT OF DAMAGES CLAIMED, BUT DOES ASSERT MULTIPLE THEORIES OF DAMAGES THAT IMPLIEDLY SEEK UP TO

$312 MILLION

OF ALLEGED EXCESS COLLATERAL, PLUS INTEREST AT LIBOR PLUS

13.5%

, COMPOUNDED DAILY. IN JUNE 2013, WE FILED A MOTION TO DISMISS PLAINTIFFS' BANKRUPTCY CLAIMS AND FOR A DETERMINATION THAT THE BREACH OF CONTRACT CLAIM IS "NON-CORE" UNDER THE BANKRUPTCY CODE. THE BANKRUPTCY COURT GRANTED OUR MOTION IN ITS ENTIRETY IN DECEMBER 2013. IN MAY 2014, THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK DENIED OUR REQUEST THAT IT WITHDRAW ITS REFERENCE OF PLAINTIFFS' ADVERSARY COMPLAINT TO THE BANKRUPTCY COURT. IN JANUARY 2015, INTEL AND THE PLAINTIFFS FILED COMPETING MOTIONS FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT. PLAINTIFFS' MOTION REQUESTS JUDGMENT AGAINST INTEL "IN THE AMOUNT OF NO LESS THAN"

$129 MILLION

, PLUS INTEREST. WE BELIEVE THAT

$129 MILLION

, PLUS INTEREST, REPRESENTS THE UPPER END OF THE RANGE OF REASONABLY POSSIBLE LOSS FOR THIS CASE, ALTHOUGH WE BELIEVE THAT WE ACTED IN A MANNER CONSISTENT WITH OUR CONTRACTUAL RIGHTS AND INTEND TO DEFEND AGAINST ANY CLAIM TO THE CONTRARY.

MCAFEE, INC. SHAREHOLDER LITIGATION

ON AUGUST 19, 2010, WE ANNOUNCED THAT WE HAD AGREED TO ACQUIRE ALL OF THE COMMON STOCK OF MCAFEE, INC. (MCAFEE) FOR

$48.00

PER SHARE. FOUR MCAFEE SHAREHOLDERS FILED PUTATIVE CLASS-ACTION LAWSUITS IN SANTA CLARA COUNTY, CALIFORNIA SUPERIOR COURT CHALLENGING THE PROPOSED TRANSACTION. THE CASES WERE ORDERED CONSOLIDATED IN SEPTEMBER 2010. PLAINTIFFS FILED AN AMENDED COMPLAINT THAT NAMED FORMER MCAFEE BOARD MEMBERS, MCAFEE, AND INTEL AS DEFENDANTS, AND ALLEGED THAT THE MCAFEE BOARD MEMBERS BREACHED THEIR FIDUCIARY DUTIES AND THAT MCAFEE AND INTEL AIDED AND ABETTED THOSE BREACHES OF DUTY. THE COMPLAINT REQUESTED RESCISSION OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT, SUCH OTHER EQUITABLE RELIEF AS THE COURT MAY DEEM PROPER, AND AN AWARD OF DAMAGES IN AN UNSPECIFIED AMOUNT. IN JUNE 2012, THE PLAINTIFFS’ DAMAGES EXPERT ASSERTED THAT THE VALUE OF A MCAFEE SHARE FOR THE PURPOSES OF ASSESSING DAMAGES SHOULD BE

$62.08.

IN MARCH 2012, DEFENDANTS FILED A PETITION WITH THE CALIFORNIA COURT OF APPEAL FOR A WRIT OF MANDATE TO REVERSE THE CLASS CERTIFICATION ORDER; THE PETITION WAS DENIED IN JUNE 2012. IN MARCH 2012, AT DEFENDANTS’ REQUEST, THE COURT HELD THAT PLAINTIFFS WERE NOT ENTITLED TO A JURY TRIAL, AND ORDERED A BENCH TRIAL. IN APRIL 2012, PLAINTIFFS FILED A PETITION WITH THE CALIFORNIA COURT OF APPEAL FOR A WRIT OF MANDATE TO REVERSE THAT ORDER, WHICH THE COURT OF APPEAL DENIED IN JULY 2012. IN AUGUST 2012, DEFENDANTS FILED A MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT. THE TRIAL COURT GRANTED THAT MOTION IN NOVEMBER 2012, AND ENTERED FINAL JUDGMENT IN THE CASE IN FEBRUARY 2013. IN APRIL 2013, PLAINTIFFS APPEALED THE FINAL JUDGMENT. INTEL, MCAFEE, AND MCAFEE’S BOARD OF DIRECTORS FILED AN OPPOSITION TO PLAINTIFF’S APPEAL IN DECEMBER 2014.

X2Y ATTENUATORS, LLC V. INTEL ET AL

IN MAY 2011, X2Y ATTENUATORS, LLC (X2Y) FILED A PATENT INFRINGEMENT LAWSUIT IN THE U.S. DISTRICT COURT FOR THE WESTERN DISTRICT OF PENNSYLVANIA AND A COMPLAINT WITH THE U.S. INTERNATIONAL TRADE COMMISSION (ITC) PURSUANT TO SECTION 337 OF THE TARIFF ACT OF 1930 AGAINST US AND TWO OF OUR CUSTOMERS, APPLE AND HEWLETT-PACKARD COMPANY, ALLEGING INFRINGEMENT OF FIVE PATENTS. X2Y SUBSEQUENTLY ADDED A SIXTH PATENT TO BOTH ACTIONS. THE DISTRICT COURT ACTION WAS STAYED PENDING RESOLUTION OF THE ITC PROCEEDING. X2Y ALLEGED THAT AT LEAST INTEL

PROCESSOR FAMILIES INFRINGE THE ASSERTED PATENTS. X2Y ALSO REQUESTED THAT THE ITC ISSUE PERMANENT EXCLUSION AND CEASE-AND-DESIST ORDERS TO, AMONG OTHER THINGS, PROHIBIT US FROM IMPORTING THESE MICROPROCESSORS AND APPLE AND HEWLETT-PACKARD COMPANY PRODUCTS THAT INCORPORATE THESE MICROPROCESSORS INTO THE U.S. IN THE STAYED DISTRICT COURT ACTION, X2Y SEEKS UNSPECIFIED DAMAGES, INCLUDING ENHANCED DAMAGES FOR ALLEGED WILLFUL INFRINGEMENT, AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF. IN JUNE 2012, THE ADMINISTRATIVE LAW JUDGE ISSUED AN INITIAL DETERMINATION GRANTING X2Y’S MOTION TO PARTIALLY TERMINATE THE ITC INVESTIGATION WITH RESPECT TO THREE OF THE ASSERTED PATENTS. THE ADMINISTRATIVE LAW JUDGE HELD A HEARING ON THE REMAINING THREE PATENTS IN AUGUST 2012 AND ISSUED AN INITIAL DETERMINATION IN DECEMBER 2012. IN THE INITIAL DETERMINATION, THE ADMINISTRATIVE LAW JUDGE FOUND THAT INTEL, APPLE, AND HEWLETT-PACKARD COMPANY HAVE NOT VIOLATED SECTION 337 OF THE TARIFF ACT OF 1930 BECAUSE THEY HAVE NOT INFRINGED ANY OF THE ASSERTED CLAIMS OF THE THREE PATENTS, AND RULED THAT THE ASSERTED CLAIMS OF TWO OF THE PATENTS WERE INVALID. IN DECEMBER 2012, THE PARTIES FILED PETITIONS FOR REVIEW OF THE INITIAL DETERMINATION BY THE ITC. IN FEBRUARY 2013, THE ITC DETERMINED TO REVIEW IN PART THE INITIAL DETERMINATION. ON REVIEW, THE ITC DETERMINED TO TERMINATE THE INVESTIGATION WITH A FINDING OF NO VIOLATION. IN APRIL 2013, X2Y FILED A NOTICE OF APPEAL WITH THE U.S. COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE FEDERAL CIRCUIT. IN JULY 2014, THE FEDERAL CIRCUIT AFFIRMED THE ITC'S FINDING THAT INTEL'S MICROPROCESSORS DID NOT INFRINGE THE X2Y PATENTS. IN SEPTEMBER 2014, X2Y FILED A PETITION FOR EN BANC REVIEW, WHICH WAS DENIED BY THE FEDERAL CIRCUIT. IN LIGHT OF THIS DENIAL BY THE FEDERAL CIRCUIT, WE HAVE CONCLUDED THAT THE RISK OF LOSS IN CONNECTION WITH THIS MATTER, IF ANY, IS NOT MATERIAL TO INTEL. WE CONTINUE TO DISPUTE THE REMAINING CLAIMS AND INTEND TO VIGOROUSLY DEFEND AGAINST THEM.

IN THE FIRST THREE MONTHS OF 2014, WE FORMED THE INTERNET OF THINGS GROUP, WHICH INCLUDES PLATFORMS AND SOFTWARE OPTIMIZED FOR THE INTERNET OF THINGS MARKET SEGMENT. ADDITIONALLY, WE CHANGED OUR ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE TO ALIGN WITH OUR CRITICAL OBJECTIVES, WHICH CHANGED INFORMATION THAT OUR CHIEF OPERATING DECISION MAKER (CODM) REVIEWS FOR PURPOSES OF ALLOCATING RESOURCES AND ASSESSING PERFORMANCE. AFTER THE REORGANIZATION, WE HAVE NINE OPERATING SEGMENTS: PC CLIENT GROUP (PCCG), DATA CENTER GROUP (DCG), INTERNET OF THINGS GROUP (IOTG), MOBILE AND COMMUNICATION GROUP (MCG), MCAFEE, SOFTWARE AND SERVICES GROUP, NON-VOLATILE MEMORY SOLUTIONS GROUP, NETBOOK GROUP, AND NEW DEVICES GROUP. ALL PRIOR-PERIOD AMOUNTS HAVE BEEN ADJUSTED RETROSPECTIVELY TO REFLECT THESE OPERATING SEGMENT CHANGES, AS WELL AS OTHER MINOR REORGANIZATIONS.

THE CODM IS OUR CEO. THE CODM ALLOCATES RESOURCES TO AND ASSESSES THE PERFORMANCE OF EACH OPERATING SEGMENT USING INFORMATION ABOUT ITS REVENUE AND OPERATING INCOME (LOSS).

WE MANAGE OUR BUSINESS ACTIVITIES PRIMARILY BASED ON A PRODUCT SEGMENTATION BASIS. PCCG, DCG, AND MCG ARE OUR REPORTABLE OPERATING SEGMENTS. IOTG AND THE AGGREGATED "SOFTWARE AND SERVICES OPERATING SEGMENTS," AS SHOWN IN THE PRECEDING OPERATING SEGMENT LIST, DO NOT MEET THE QUANTITATIVE THRESHOLDS TO QUALIFY AS REPORTABLE OPERATING SEGMENTS; HOWEVER, WE HAVE ELECTED TO DISCLOSE THE RESULTS OF THESE NON-REPORTABLE OPERATING SEGMENTS. OUR NON-VOLATILE MEMORY SOLUTIONS GROUP, NETBOOK GROUP, AND NEW DEVICES GROUP OPERATING SEGMENTS DO NOT MEET THE QUANTITATIVE THRESHOLDS TO QUALIFY AS REPORTABLE SEGMENTS AND THEIR COMBINED RESULTS ARE INCLUDED WITHIN THE "ALL OTHER" CATEGORY.

IN NOVEMBER 2014, WE ANNOUNCED THE IMPLEMENTATION OF A NEW OPERATING STRUCTURE. OUR NEW STRUCTURE REFLECTS OUR STRATEGY TO ADDRESS ALL ASPECTS OF THE CLIENT COMPUTING MARKET SEGMENT AND UTILIZE OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY TO OFFER COMPELLING SOLUTIONS. THE NEW OPERATING STRUCTURE ENSURES THAT WE ARE ABLE TO RESPOND TO MARKET DEMAND, WHILE REDUCING COSTS THROUGH EFFICIENCIES AND PRODUCTS TARGETED FOR THE CLIENT COMPUTING MARKET SEGMENT. AS A RESULT OF THE IMPLEMENTATION OF OUR NEW OPERATING STRUCTURE, ALL PRIOR-PERIOD AMOUNTS WILL BE ADJUSTED RETROSPECTIVELY TO REFLECT THE NEW ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE EXPECTED TO BECOME EFFECTIVE IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2015.

•

SOFTWARE AND SERVICES OPERATING SEGMENTS.

INCLUDES SOFTWARE PRODUCTS FOR ENDPOINT SECURITY, NETWORK AND CONTENT SECURITY, RISK AND COMPLIANCE, AND CONSUMER AND MOBILE SECURITY FROM OUR MCAFEE BUSINESS, AND SOFTWARE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES THAT PROMOTE INTEL

ARCHITECTURE AS THE PLATFORM OF CHOICE FOR SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT.

WE HAVE SALES AND MARKETING, MANUFACTURING, ENGINEERING, FINANCE, AND ADMINISTRATION GROUPS. EXPENSES FOR THESE GROUPS ARE GENERALLY ALLOCATED TO THE OPERATING SEGMENTS, AND THE EXPENSES ARE INCLUDED IN THE FOLLOWING OPERATING RESULTS.

THE "ALL OTHER" CATEGORY INCLUDES REVENUE, EXPENSES, AND CHARGES SUCH AS.

•

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FROM OUR NON-VOLATILE MEMORY SOLUTIONS GROUP, NETBOOK GROUP, AND NEW DEVICES GROUP;

•

AMOUNTS INCLUDED WITHIN RESTRUCTURING AND ASSET IMPAIRMENT CHARGES;

•

A PORTION OF PROFIT-DEPENDENT COMPENSATION AND OTHER EXPENSES NOT ALLOCATED TO THE OPERATING SEGMENTS;

•

DIVESTED BUSINESSES FOR WHICH DISCRETE OPERATING RESULTS ARE NOT REGULARLY REVIEWED BY OUR CODM;

•

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OF START-UP BUSINESSES THAT SUPPORT OUR INITIATIVES, INCLUDING OUR FOUNDRY BUSINESS; AND

•

ACQUISITION-RELATED COSTS, INCLUDING AMORTIZATION AND ANY IMPAIRMENT OF ACQUISITION-RELATED INTANGIBLES AND GOODWILL.

THE CODM DOES NOT EVALUATE OPERATING SEGMENTS USING DISCRETE ASSET INFORMATION. BASED ON THE INTERCHANGEABLE NATURE OF OUR MANUFACTURING AND ASSEMBLY AND TEST ASSETS, MOST OF THE RELATED DEPRECIATION EXPENSE IS NOT DIRECTLY IDENTIFIABLE WITHIN OUR OPERATING SEGMENTS, AS IT IS INCLUDED IN OVERHEAD COST POOLS AND SUBSEQUENTLY ABSORBED INTO INVENTORY AS EACH PRODUCT PASSES THROUGH OUR MANUFACTURING PROCESS. AS OUR PRODUCTS ARE THEN SOLD ACROSS MULTIPLE OPERATING SEGMENTS, IT IS IMPRACTICABLE TO DETERMINE THE TOTAL DEPRECIATION EXPENSE INCLUDED AS A COMPONENT OF EACH OPERATING SEGMENT’S OPERATING INCOME (LOSS) RESULTS. OPERATING SEGMENTS DO NOT RECORD INTER-SEGMENT REVENUE. WE DO NOT ALLOCATE GAINS AND LOSSES FROM EQUITY INVESTMENTS, INTEREST AND OTHER INCOME, OR TAXES TO OPERATING SEGMENTS. ALTHOUGH THE CODM USES OPERATING INCOME TO EVALUATE THE SEGMENTS, OPERATING COSTS INCLUDED IN ONE SEGMENT MAY BENEFIT OTHER SEGMENTS. EXCEPT FOR THESE DIFFERENCES, THE ACCOUNTING POLICIES FOR SEGMENT REPORTING ARE THE SAME AS FOR INTEL AS A WHOLE.

ITEM 9A.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

EVALUATION OF DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

BASED ON MANAGEMENT’S EVALUATION (WITH THE PARTICIPATION OF OUR CEO AND CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER (CFO)), AS OF THE END OF THE PERIOD COVERED BY THIS REPORT, OUR CEO AND CFO HAVE CONCLUDED THAT OUR DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES (AS DEFINED IN RULES 13A-15(E) AND 15D-15(E) UNDER THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934, AS AMENDED (THE EXCHANGE ACT)), ARE EFFECTIVE TO PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE THAT INFORMATION REQUIRED TO BE DISCLOSED BY US IN REPORTS THAT WE FILE OR SUBMIT UNDER THE EXCHANGE ACT IS RECORDED, PROCESSED, SUMMARIZED, AND REPORTED WITHIN THE TIME PERIODS SPECIFIED IN U.S. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (SEC) RULES AND FORMS, AND IS ACCUMULATED AND COMMUNICATED TO MANAGEMENT, INCLUDING OUR PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND PRINCIPAL FINANCIAL OFFICER, AS APPROPRIATE, TO ALLOW TIMELY DECISIONS REGARDING REQUIRED DISCLOSURE.

CHANGES IN INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

THERE WERE NO CHANGES TO OUR INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING (AS DEFINED IN RULES 13A-15(F) AND 15D-15(F) UNDER THE EXCHANGE ACT) THAT OCCURRED DURING THE QUARTER ENDED

DECEMBER 27, 2014

, THAT HAVE MATERIALLY AFFECTED, OR ARE REASONABLY LIKELY TO MATERIALLY AFFECT, OUR INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING.

MANAGEMENT REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

OUR MANAGEMENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ESTABLISHING AND MAINTAINING ADEQUATE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING (AS DEFINED IN RULES 13A-15(F) AND 15D-15(F) UNDER THE EXCHANGE ACT) TO PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING THE RELIABILITY OF OUR FINANCIAL REPORTING AND THE PREPARATION OF CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR EXTERNAL PURPOSES IN ACCORDANCE WITH U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES.

MANAGEMENT ASSESSED OUR INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF

DECEMBER 27, 2014

, THE END OF OUR FISCAL YEAR. MANAGEMENT BASED ITS ASSESSMENT ON CRITERIA ESTABLISHED IN INTERNAL CONTROL—INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK ISSUED BY THE COMMITTEE OF SPONSORING ORGANIZATIONS OF THE TREADWAY COMMISSION (

2013 FRAMEWORK

). MANAGEMENT’S ASSESSMENT INCLUDED EVALUATION OF ELEMENTS SUCH AS THE DESIGN AND OPERATING EFFECTIVENESS OF KEY FINANCIAL REPORTING CONTROLS, PROCESS DOCUMENTATION, ACCOUNTING POLICIES, AND OUR OVERALL CONTROL ENVIRONMENT.

BASED ON THIS ASSESSMENT, MANAGEMENT HAS CONCLUDED THAT OUR INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING WAS EFFECTIVE AS OF THE END OF THE FISCAL YEAR TO PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING THE RELIABILITY OF FINANCIAL REPORTING AND THE PREPARATION OF CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR EXTERNAL REPORTING PURPOSES IN ACCORDANCE WITH U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES. WE REVIEWED THE RESULTS OF MANAGEMENT’S ASSESSMENT WITH THE AUDIT COMMITTEE OF OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS.

OUR INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM, ERNST & YOUNG LLP, INDEPENDENTLY ASSESSED THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE COMPANY’S INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, AS STATED IN THE FIRM’S ATTESTATION REPORT, WHICH IS INCLUDED AT THE END OF PART II, ITEM 8 OF THIS FORM 10-K.

INHERENT LIMITATIONS ON EFFECTIVENESS OF CONTROLS

OUR MANAGEMENT, INCLUDING THE CEO AND CFO, DOES NOT EXPECT THAT OUR DISCLOSURE CONTROLS OR OUR INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING WILL PREVENT OR DETECT ALL ERRORS AND ALL FRAUD. A CONTROL SYSTEM, NO MATTER HOW WELL DESIGNED AND OPERATED, CAN PROVIDE ONLY REASONABLE, NOT ABSOLUTE, ASSURANCE THAT THE CONTROL SYSTEM’S OBJECTIVES WILL BE MET. THE DESIGN OF A CONTROL SYSTEM MUST REFLECT THE FACT THAT THERE ARE RESOURCE CONSTRAINTS, AND THE BENEFITS OF CONTROLS MUST BE CONSIDERED RELATIVE TO THEIR COSTS. FURTHER, BECAUSE OF THE INHERENT LIMITATIONS IN ALL CONTROL SYSTEMS, NO EVALUATION OF CONTROLS CAN PROVIDE ABSOLUTE ASSURANCE THAT MISSTATEMENTS DUE TO ERROR OR FRAUD WILL NOT OCCUR OR THAT ALL CONTROL ISSUES AND INSTANCES OF FRAUD, IF ANY, HAVE BEEN DETECTED. THE DESIGN OF ANY SYSTEM OF CONTROLS IS BASED IN PART ON CERTAIN ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT THE LIKELIHOOD OF FUTURE EVENTS, AND THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT ANY DESIGN WILL SUCCEED IN ACHIEVING ITS STATED GOALS UNDER ALL POTENTIAL FUTURE CONDITIONS. PROJECTIONS OF ANY EVALUATION OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF CONTROLS TO FUTURE PERIODS ARE SUBJECT TO RISKS. OVER TIME, CONTROLS MAY BECOME INADEQUATE BECAUSE OF CHANGES IN CONDITIONS OR DETERIORATION IN THE DEGREE OF COMPLIANCE WITH POLICIES OR PROCEDURES.
