products include processors and board- and system-level products based on the P6 micro-architecture (including the Intel&reg; Celeron&#153;, Pentium&reg; </FONT> <FONT SIZE=2>III</FONT><FONT SIZE=2> and Pentium&reg; </FONT><FONT
SIZE=2>III</FONT><FONT SIZE=2> Xeon&#153; processors) as well as the Intel&reg;
NetBurst&#153; micro-architecture with the release of the Pentium&reg; 4 processor. We also provide core-logic chipsets for most of our microprocessor products, which
improve ease of use for our OEM customers, provide new capabilities and enable system performance to scale as the processor performance increases. In addition, to further enhance the acceptance and
deployment of these products by our customers, we provide e-Business enabling solutions. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Microprocessors.</I></B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;A microprocessor is the central processing unit of a computer system. It
processes system data and controls other devices in the system, acting as the brains of the computer. One indicator of microprocessor performance is its clock speed, the rate at which its internal
logic operates, which is measured in units of hertz, or cycles processed per second. One megahertz (MHz) equals one million cycles processed per second, and one gigahertz (GHz) equals one billion
cycles processed per second. Other indicators of chip performance are memory storage and access. The memory stored on a chip is measured in bytes, with 1,024 bytes equaling one kilobyte (KB),
1.049&nbsp;million bytes equaling one megabyte (MB), and 1.074&nbsp;billion bytes equaling one gigabyte (GB). Cache is a memory subsystem in which frequently used data is duplicated for quick
access. A second level of cache (L2) located directly on the microprocessor, can also be used to further increase system performance. </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our
developments in semiconductor design and manufacturing have made it possible to decrease the size of circuits etched into silicon, permitting a greater number of transistors to be
used on each
microprocessor die, and a greater number of microprocessors to be made from each silicon wafer. The result is smaller, faster microprocessors that consume less power and cost less to manufacture. The
width of the individual transistors on a chip is measured in microns; one micron equals one millionth of a meter. In 2000, we finished converting substantially all of our microprocessor manufacturing
to the 0.18-micron process technology, and in November we announced completion of the development of the 0.13-micron process technology. See the discussion of manufacturing
process technologies under the heading "Manufacturing, Assembly and Test" in Part&nbsp;I, Item 1 of this Form&nbsp;10-K. </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
2000, we announced several new microprocessor products aimed at the various computing market segments ranging from value PCs (systems costing less than $1,000) to
high-performance workstations and servers. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Value PCs.</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;The Intel Celeron processor meets the core computing needs and affordability requirements common to many new
PC users. During 2000, we introduced several higher speed versions of the Celeron processor running at speeds ranging from 533 to 766 MHz. The 566 MHz and 600 MHz versions, introduced in
March&nbsp;2000, were the first Celeron processors to integrate Internet </FONT></P>

Streaming SIMD extensions, which help improve multimedia performance significantly over previous versions. In January&nbsp;2001, we introduced an 800-MHz version of the Celeron
processor, our first desktop value PC processor to include a 100-MHz system bus. This technology provides a wider communications path between the processor and the rest of the system,
resulting in faster overall system performance. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Performance desktop PCs.</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;The Pentium </FONT><FONT SIZE=2>III</FONT><FONT SIZE=2> processor is aimed at desktop
PC users who need powerful performance for a variety of demanding applications and Internet functions. This processor features an integrated L2 cache that runs at the full speed of the processor core.
L2 cache, also known as Advanced Transfer Cache, enables the performance of applications to scale with increasing clock frequencies. In March&nbsp;2000, we introduced the Pentium </FONT> <FONT SIZE=2>III</FONT><FONT SIZE=2> processor running at 1
GHz. During 2000, we also introduced versions running at 850, 866 and 933 MHz. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
November&nbsp;2000, we introduced the Pentium 4 processor running at 1.5 and 1.4 GHz. At the end of 2000, this was our highest performance processor for the desktop PC segment.
The Pentium 4 processor is our first completely new desktop processor design since the P6 micro-architecture was introduced in 1995. The Pentium 4 processor incorporates the Intel NetBurst
micro-architecture to deliver improved performance for video and audio, 3D graphics, and a variety of Internet technologies, including streaming video, speech processing and other multimedia
processing tasks. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mobile PCs.</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;We design our products for mobile PCs to provide notebook and laptop PC users with the performance they
need while meeting the power consumption and size constraints of mobile PCs. As with our desktop products, mobile products are available at a variety of price/performance points which allows our OEM
customers to meet the demands of all notebook PC designs. These notebook designs include full size, thin and light and ultra-portable. In 2000, we introduced several mobile Celeron processors ranging
from 400 to 700 MHz, aimed at the value mobile PC market segment. In January&nbsp;2000, we introduced mobile Pentium </FONT><FONT SIZE=2>III</FONT><FONT SIZE=2> processors featuring
Intel&reg; SpeedStep&#153; technology running at 600 and 650 MHz. Intel SpeedStep technology allows the processor to switch to a lower voltage and clock speed when the user is
disconnected from an AC power source in order to extend the system's battery life; the chip resumes full speed when the user plugs back into an outlet or docking station. In June&nbsp;2000, we
introduced two more Pentium </FONT><FONT SIZE=2>III</FONT><FONT SIZE=2> processors featuring Intel SpeedStep technology, including one that consumes less than one watt of power on average. In
September&nbsp;2000, we introduced 800- and 850-MHz versions of the mobile Pentium </FONT><FONT SIZE=2>III</FONT><FONT SIZE=2> processor, which use Intel SpeedStep
technology to drop power consumption down to as low as 1.35 volts. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
January&nbsp;2001, we introduced the Ultra Low Voltage mobile Pentium </FONT><FONT SIZE=2>III</FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;processor running at 500 MHz. Designed for mobile
PCs weighing less than 3 pounds and measuring one inch in height, it is the industry's first processor to operate at under 1 volt while consuming less than half a watt of power. At the same time, we
announced the Ultra Low Voltage mobile Celeron processor running at 500 MHz. In February&nbsp;2001, we introduced the Low Voltage mobile Pentium </FONT><FONT SIZE=2>III</FONT><FONT SIZE=2>
processor running at 700 MHz capable at operating at 1.1 volts while consuming less than 1 watt of power. The Ultra Low Voltage processors are targeted for the sub-notebook market while
the Low Voltage processors are targeted for the mini-notebook market, both in the ultra-portable design category. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Servers and workstations.</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;In May&nbsp;2000, we announced new Pentium </FONT> <FONT SIZE=2>III</FONT><FONT SIZE=2> Xeon processors for use in high-performance
multiprocessing servers, which use between four and eight processors per system. The
700-MHz processors were the first "large cache" Pentium </FONT><FONT SIZE=2>III</FONT><FONT SIZE=2> Xeon processors built on our 0.18-micron manufacturing technology,
and have either 1 or 2 MB of L2 cache on the die. The 2-MB version integrates 140&nbsp;million transistors on a single microprocessor die. In August&nbsp;2000, we introduced the
industry's first GHz processor for servers and high-end workstations. OEMs&nbsp;began offering systems featuring the Pentium </FONT><FONT SIZE=2>III</FONT><FONT SIZE=2> Xeon
processor running at 1 GHz in the third quarter of 2000, targeting the high-end workstation and front-end server segments. Front-end or Internet servers, featuring

two processors, have become a common solution for companies conducting e-Business over the Internet. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
February&nbsp;2001, we announced that the next generation of our 32-bit processor line for servers, formerly codenamed Foster, will be branded Intel&reg;
Xeon, dropping the Pentium portion in the name. The Intel Xeon processor is based on the Intel NetBurst micro-architecture. We expect to introduce products under the Intel Xeon name in 2001. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
continued development of our next-generation 64-bit processor for high-end servers and workstations, the Intel Itanium&#153; processor.
This microprocessor will expand the capabilities of the Intel architecture to address the high-performance server and workstation market segments, while still running the software that
currently operates on machines based on our 32-bit processors. A 64-bit microprocessor is more complex than a 32-bit microprocessor and requires a more complex
system architecture, but it can handle twice as much data in each clock cycle. Thus, a 64-bit processor enables most data-intensive applications, such as enterprise resource
planning and intensive graphics modeling, to run much faster than they would on a 32-bit processor. In October&nbsp;2000, we hosted the eXCHANGE e-Business Summit, at which
many OEMs&nbsp;demonstrated server systems based on a prototype version of the Itanium processor. More than 400 applications are in development, and we have shipped thousands of prototype systems
and processors since November&nbsp;1999. In 2000, we began to ship processors for systems used by information technology end users in pilot installations and we expect the release of production
systems during 2001. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also
during 2000, we announced e-Business enabling solutions designed to further enhance the acceptance and deployment of Intel Architecture-based systems. These services
will be deployed through our Intel Solution Centers and include hardware, software, lab testing equipment and engineering services that Web integrators can use to validate and deploy comprehensive
e-Business solutions in conjunction with leading industry suppliers. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chipsets.</I></B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;Chipsets perform essential logic functions supporting the central processing unit,
and extend the graphics, audio, video and other capabilities of many systems based on our processors. Our chipsets are compatible with one or more of a variety of industry-accepted buses, such as the
Peripheral Components Interconnect (PCI) Local Bus specification and the Accelerated Graphics Port (AGP) specification. A bus is a circuit that carries data between parts of the system, for example,
between the processor and main memory. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To
help computer makers accelerate their products' time-to-market, we design, manufacture and sell chipsets for each computing market segment. In 2000, we
introduced the Intel&reg; 820E, 815 and 815E chipsets for Pentium </FONT><FONT SIZE=2>III</FONT><FONT SIZE=2> processor-based PCs, each with a new input/output controller hub
delivering greater system performance and flexibility. We also introduced the Intel&reg; 815EM mobile chipset with integrated graphics for mobile PCs based on the Pentium </FONT> <FONT SIZE=2>III</FONT><FONT SIZE=2> and Celeron processors, and the
Intel&reg; 850 chipset supporting the Pentium 4 processor. </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
January&nbsp;2001, we introduced the Intel&reg; 810E2 chipset for Celeron processors, which enables PC makers to provide faster disk drive performance, more Universal
Serial Bus (USB) ports and surround sound audio in systems priced at less than $1,000. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For
workstation and server makers, we provide the Intel&reg; 840 chipset, which supports the Pentium </FONT><FONT SIZE=2>III</FONT><FONT SIZE=2> Xeon processor to
enhance system features and capabilities allowing greater texturing, more fluid movements, and better display output in demanding workstations and servers. We also offer the Profusion&#153;
chipset, supporting up to eight Pentium&nbsp;</FONT><FONT SIZE=2>III</FONT><FONT SIZE=2> Xeon processors, designed to help OEM customers build advanced multiprocessing servers. </FONT></P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Intel's customers demand alternatives in the area of memory architecture. In response to that demand Intel chipsets currently support Rambus Dynamic Random Access Memory (RDRAM) and
Synchronous DRAM (SDRAM). In the future Intel expects to add support for Double Data Rate DRAM (DDR) to its product line. Intel has adopted RDRAM as the primary memory solution for its flagship
desktop Pentium 4 processors and is actively working with the industry to promote RDRAM as the highest performance desktop memory solution. </FONT></P>

our consolidated net revenues and a substantial majority of gross margin. Sales of Pentium&reg; family processors, including Pentium processors with MMX&#153; technology were rapidly
declining but still a significant portion of our revenues and gross margin for 1998. In 2000, we initiated a program to replace motherboards that had a defective memory translator hub component that
enabled SDRAM to work with the Intel&reg; 820 chipset. The total impact on gross margin for this program was approximately $253&nbsp;million. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The majority of our wafer production, including microprocessor, flash memory and networking silicon fabrication, is conducted within the United States at our
facilities in New Mexico, Oregon, Arizona, California and Massachusetts. A significant portion of our wafer production, primarily microprocessor and chipset fabrication, is conducted outside the
United States at facilities in Israel and Ireland. For the fourth quarter of 2000, the Israel and Ireland facilities accounted for approximately 30% of our total wafer fabrication. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As
of year-end 2000, substantially all of our microprocessors were built using the 0.18-micron process technology. We are manufacturing wafers using the
0.18-micron process technology in Arizona, California, Ireland, Israel, New Mexico and Oregon. In November&nbsp;2000, we announced the completion of the development of the
0.13-micron (130 nanometer) process technology. The 0.13-micron process technology features structures that are smaller than 1/1,000th the thickness of a human hair (0.18
microns is 1/500th the thickness of a human hair). We expect to begin manufacturing our first product using 0.13-micron process technology in production volumes in the second half of 2001,
enabling us to continue to deliver new generations of high-performance microprocessors. We believe that we were the first company to complete development of the 0.13-micron
process technology and to demonstrate manufacturing readiness with complex integrated circuits. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
2000, we announced that we would begin building high-volume 300mm (12-inch wafer) fabrication facilities. Some of these facilities will begin production on
0.13-micron process technology. The largest wafer size we currently use in wafer production is 200mm (8-inch wafer). We expect the larger 300mm wafer size to cut die
manufacturing costs by more than 30%. We plan to start production using 300mm wafers in 2002. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During
the first quarter of 2000, we purchased a fabrication facility in Colorado. During 2000, we made substantial retrofitting changes and process improvements at this facility,
including equipment installations to manufacture flash memory. We expect to begin manufacturing at the Colorado facility in the second quarter of 2001. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
also manufacture microprocessor- and networking-related board-level products and systems at facilities in Malaysia, Oregon and Washington. In addition, we manufacture board-level
products in Puerto Rico; however, in January&nbsp;2001, we announced that we would phase out our manufacturing operations in Puerto Rico during the first half of 2001. Based on an assessment across
our worldwide
board-level manufacturing facilities, we concluded that the operations in Puerto Rico were less cost competitive than our other operations. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A
substantial majority of our components assembly and testing, including assembly and testing for microprocessors, is performed at facilities in Costa Rica, Malaysia and the
Philippines. We also perform components assembly and testing at a facility in China, and in August&nbsp;2000 announced plans to expand this facility. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To
augment capacity in the United States as well as internationally, we use subcontractors to perform assembly of certain products and wafer fabrication for certain components,
primarily flash memory, chipsets, and networking and communications component products. We also use subcontractors for the manufacture of some board-level products and systems, and purchase certain
communication networking products and PC peripherals from external vendors. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
general, if we were unable to manufacture wafers or to assemble and test our products abroad, or if air transportation between our foreign facilities and the United States were

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Manufacturing
of integrated circuits is a complex process. Normal manufacturing risks include errors and interruptions in the production process and defects in raw materials, as well

specific product demand. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B><I>EMPLOYEES  </I></B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As of December&nbsp;30, 2000, we employed approximately 86,100 people worldwide. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most of our products are sold or licensed through sales offices located near major concentrations of users throughout North America, Europe,
Asia-Pacific, Japan and other parts of the world. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
also use industrial and retail distributors and representatives to distribute our products both within and outside the United States. Typically, distributors handle a wide variety
of products, including those that compete with our products, and fill orders for many customers. Most of our sales to distributors are made under agreements allowing for price protection on unsold
merchandise and right of return on stipulated quantities of unsold merchandise. Sales representatives generally do not offer directly competitive products but may carry complementary items
manufactured by others. Representatives do not maintain a product inventory; instead, their customers place orders directly with us or through distributors. We conducted business with more than 2,500
customers worldwide in 2000, including customers of our acquired companies. Compaq Computer Corporation and Dell Computer Corporation each contributed approximately 13% to our total sales in 2000. A
substantial majority of the sales to these two customers consisted of Intel Architecture Group products. No other customer accounted for more than 10% of our total revenues. Sales to our five largest
customers accounted for approximately 42% of total revenues. The information regarding revenues and operating profit by reportable segments and revenues from unaffiliated customers by geographic
region under the heading "Operating segment and geographic information" on page 33 of our 2000 Annual Report to Stockholders, is incorporated by reference. </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2><B><I>BACKLOG  </I></B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our sales are made primarily pursuant to standard purchase orders for delivery of standard products. We have some agreements that give a customer the right to
purchase a specific number of products during a specified time period. Although not generally obligating the customer to purchase any particular number of such products, some of these agreements do
contain billback clauses. Under these clauses, customers who do not purchase the full volume agreed to are liable for billback on previous shipments up to the price appropriate for the quantity
actually purchased. As a matter of industry practice, billback clauses are difficult to enforce. The quantity actually purchased by the customer, as well as the shipment schedules, are frequently
revised during the agreement term to reflect changes in the customer's needs. In light of industry practice and experience, we do not believe that such agreements are meaningful for determining
backlog amounts. We believe that only a small portion of our order backlog is noncancellable and that the dollar amount associated with the noncancellable portion is not material. Therefore, we do not
believe that backlog as of any particular date is indicative of future results. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our goal is to be the preeminent building block supplier to the worldwide Internet economy. Our primary focus areas are the desktop and mobile platforms, the
server platform, and networking and communications including wireless communications, as well as new business opportunities around the Internet. In each of these market segments, we compete, to
various degrees, on the basis of functionality, performance, quality, price and availability. We are engaged in a rapidly advancing field of technology in which our ability to compete depends upon our
ability to improve our products and processes, develop new products to meet changing customer requirements and reduce costs. Prices decline rapidly in the semiconductor industry as unit volumes grow,
further competition develops and production experience is accumulated. Many companies compete with us in the various computing, networking and communications market segments and are engaged in the
same basic fields of activity, including research and development. Both within and outside the United States, these competitors range in size from large multinational companies to smaller companies
competing in specialized market segments. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Intel Architecture Group operating segment supports the desktop, mobile and server platform initiatives. Our strategy for the desktop, mobile and server platforms is to introduce
ever-higher performance microprocessors and chipsets, developed for different market segments of the worldwide computing market, using a tiered branding approach. To further enhance the
acceptance and deployment of these products by our customers, we also provide e-Business enabling solutions. In line with our strategy, we seek to develop higher performance
microprocessors based on the P6 micro-architecture specifically for each computing segment. We also plan to introduce higher performance versions of processors based on the Intel NetBurst
micro-architecture. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our
financial results are substantially dependent on sales of microprocessors by the Intel Architecture Group. A number of competitors market software-compatible products intended to
compete with Intel Architecture-based processors. We also face significant competition from companies offering rival microprocessor architectures. The Celeron processor competes with existing and
future products in the highly competitive value PC market segment. The Pentium </FONT><FONT SIZE=2>III</FONT><FONT SIZE=2> processor and the Pentium 4 processor compete with existing and
future products in the performance desktop and entry-level workstation market segment. Competitive product offerings in the performance desktop market segment have recently increased. The
Pentium&nbsp;</FONT><FONT SIZE=2>III</FONT><FONT SIZE=2> Xeon processor competes in the mid-range and high-end server and workstation market segments with established
products based on rival architectures. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many
of our competitors are licensed to use our patents. Furthermore, based on current case law, our competitors can design microprocessors that are compatible with our

cannot predict whether our products will continue to compete successfully with such existing rival architectures or whether new architectures will
establish or gain market acceptance or provide increased competition with our products. Future distortion of price maturity curves could occur if software-compatible products enter the market segment
in significant volume or alternative architectures gain market acceptance. </FONT></P>

plan to cultivate new businesses as well as continue to work with the computing industry to expand Internet capabilities and product offerings, and develop compelling software
applications that can take advantage of higher performance microprocessors and chipsets, increasing demand for Intel's newer products in each computing market segment. We may continue to take various
steps, including reducing microprocessor prices and offering rebates at such times as we deem appropriate, in order to increase acceptance of our latest technology and to remain competitive within
each relevant market segment. </FONT></P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the networking and communications infrastructure area, our strategy is to deliver both system-level communications building blocks at various levels of integration and
component-level silicon building blocks for networking and communications systems. We have made acquisitions and expect to make additional acquisitions to grow the networking and communications areas.
The network communications silicon and network connectivity products from the Network Communications Group face competition from both established and emerging companies. The competitors in these areas
use aggressive product and acquisition plans in efforts to achieve leading-edge market positions. The Communications Products Group operating segment supports initiatives to deliver the
system-level communications products directed at service providers running e-Business data centers. The Communications Products Group focuses on selling its Intel NetStructure products to
OEM customers. The Communications Products Group also provides component-level products for converged voice and data communications systems for the telecommunications industry. These products compete
in the small and mid-sized enterprise market segments with established products and leading-edge Internet communications systems and server products. We cannot predict whether
our networking and communications products will continue to compete successfully with products from existing competitors or products from new entrants to these market segments. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
the cellular wireless communications business, our strategy is to deliver feature-rich, enhanced flash memory products and high-speed processors for
handheld wireless devices that require high performance and low power. In supplying these products, our Wireless Communications and Computing Group faces competition from established companies in the
flash memory, applications processor and baseband chipset market segments. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our competitive position has developed to a large extent because of our emphasis on research and development. This emphasis has enabled us to deliver
leading-edge technology and has permitted our customers to commit to the use of these new products in the development of their own products. Our research and development activities are
directed toward developing new products, hardware technologies and manufacturing processes, as well as improving existing products and lowering costs. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A
substantial majority of the design and development of components and other products is performed in the United States at our facilities in California, Oregon, Arizona and
Washington. Outside the United States, we have product development facilities at various locations, including Israel, Denmark and Malaysia. We also maintain research and development facilities
dedicated to improving manufacturing processes in Arizona, California and Oregon. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
2000, we shipped thousands of prototype processors based on the IA-64 architecture for high-end servers, under the Itanium brand, and began to ship
processors for systems used by information technology end users in pilot installations. We expect the release of production systems during 2001. The Itanium processor is built on the
0.18-micron process technology. During 2000, approximately half of our microprocessor research and development budget was spent on initiatives related to the server and workstation market
segment. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
addition to microprocessor and chipset research and development, we have research and development initiatives in wireless devices, networking and communications products, connected
peripherals and other areas. These research and development initiatives include projects surrounding the Intel XScale micro-architecture for wireless devices and the Intel IXA architecture for
networking and communications products. We have also acquired ongoing research and development activities in these areas with businesses acquired in 2000. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our
expenditures for research and development were $3,897&nbsp;million in fiscal year 2000, $3,111&nbsp;million in fiscal year 1999 and $2,509&nbsp;million in fiscal year 1998.
These amounts exclude charges for purchased in-process research and development related to acquisitions of $109&nbsp;million for fiscal year 2000, $392&nbsp;million for fiscal year
1999 and $165&nbsp;million for fiscal year 1998. At December&nbsp;2000, we had approximately 20,500 employees engaged in research and development. The success of our research and development
activities is dependent upon competitive circumstances as well as our ability to bring new
products to market in each computing market segment and in our other businesses in a timely and cost-effective manner. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B><I>ACQUISITIONS AND STRATEGIC INVESTMENTS  </I></B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During 2000, we acquired 16 businesses for more than $2.7&nbsp;billion, augmenting our capabilities in a number of strategic areas. The companies acquired
included Ambient, GIGA, Picazo, Basis, Trillium and Ziatech. These acquisitions are discussed under the "Products" heading in Part&nbsp;I, Item 1 of this Form&nbsp;10-K in connection
with each related business group. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under
our Intel Capital program, we also make equity investments to further our strategic objectives and to support our key business initiatives in the areas of desktop and mobile
platforms, server platforms, networking and communications, and Internet services. We want to stimulate growth in computing, communications and the Internet, and to grow the total information
infrastructure, in order to create and expand markets for our products. This strategic investment program helps advance our overall mission of being a leading provider of key building blocks to the
Internet economy. While financial returns are not our primary goal, our strategic investment program seeks to invest in companies that can succeed and have an impact on their market segment. When the
strategic objectives of an investment have been achieved, or if the investment diverges from our strategic objectives, we may decide to dispose of the investment. As of year-end 2000, our
strategic equity portfolio was valued </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B><I>INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND LICENSING  </I></B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Intellectual property rights that apply to our various products include patents, copyrights, trade secrets, trademarks and maskwork rights. Intel has
established an active program to protect its investment in technology by enforcing its intellectual property rights. We do not intend to license our intellectual property rights broadly unless we can
obtain adequate consideration. We also refer to information appearing under the heading "Competition" in Part&nbsp;I, Item 1 of this Form&nbsp;10-K. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
have filed and obtained a number of patents in the United States and abroad, and we have entered into patent cross-license agreements with many of our major competitors and other
parties. While our
intellectual property rights are important to our success, our business as a whole is not materially dependent upon any particular patent or license. We and other companies in the computer,
telecommunications and related high-technology fields typically apply for and receive, in the aggregate, thousands of patents annually in the United States and other countries. In
addition, because of the fast pace of innovation and product development, our products are often obsolete before the patents related to them expire. As a result, we believe that the duration of the
applicable patents is adequate relative to the expected lives of our products. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
protect many of our computer programs by copyrighting them. We have registered numerous copyrights with the United States Copyright Office. The ability to protect or copyright
software in some foreign jurisdictions is not clear. However, it is our policy to require customers to obtain a software license contract before we provide them with certain computer programs. Certain
components contain embedded computer programs, and we have also obtained copyright protection for some of these programs. In addition, we have obtained protection for the maskworks for a number of our
components under the Chip Protection Act of 1984. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
have obtained certain trademarks and trade names for our products to distinguish genuine Intel products from our competitors' products, and we are currently engaged in a
cooperative program with OEMs&nbsp;to identify with the Intel Inside&reg; logo certain personal computers containing genuine Intel microprocessors. We maintain certain details about our
processes, products and strategies as trade secrets. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like
many companies in the semiconductor and other high-technology industries, we have from time to time been notified of claims that we may be infringing certain
intellectual property rights of others. These claims have been referred to counsel, and they are in various stages of evaluation and negotiation. If it appears necessary or desirable, we may seek
licenses for these intellectual property rights. We can give no assurance that licenses will be offered by all claimants, that the terms of any offered licenses will be acceptable to us or that in all
cases the dispute will be resolved without litigation, which may be time consuming and expensive, and may result in injunctive relief or the payment of damages by us. We also refer to the information
appearing under the heading "Legal Proceedings" in Part&nbsp;I, Item 3 of this Form&nbsp;10-K. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B><I>COMPLIANCE WITH ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS  </I></B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To our present knowledge, compliance with federal, state and local provisions enacted or adopted for protection of the environment has had no material effect
upon our operations. Reference is made to the information appearing under the heading "Legal Proceedings" in Part&nbsp;I, Item 3 of this Form&nbsp;10-K. </FONT></P>

Corporation v. Intel<BR></FONT> <FONT SIZE=2><I>U.S. District Court, Northern District of Alabama, Northeastern Division (CV-97-N-3023-NE)</I></FONT></P>

<UL>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>In
November&nbsp;1997, Intergraph Corporation filed suit in Federal District Court in Alabama, generally alleging that Intel attempted to coerce Intergraph into relinquishing certain patent rights.
The suit alleges that Intel infringes five Intergraph microprocessor-related patents and includes alleged violations of antitrust laws and various state law claims. The suit seeks injunctive relief,
damages and prejudgment interest, and further alleges that Intel's infringement is willful and that any damages awarded should be trebled. Intergraph's expert witness has claimed that Intergraph is
entitled to damages of approximately $2.2&nbsp;billion for Intel's alleged patent infringement, $500&nbsp;million for the alleged antitrust violations and an undetermined amount for alleged state
law violations. Intel believes that it does not infringe Intergraph's patents and believes those patents are invalid and unenforceable. Intel has counterclaimed that the Intergraph patents are invalid
and further alleges infringement of seven Intel patents, breach of contract and misappropriation of trade secrets. In October&nbsp;1999, the court reconsidered an earlier adverse ruling and granted
Intel's motion for summary judgment that the Intergraph patents are licensed to Intel, and dismissed all of Intergraph's patent infringement claims with prejudice. This ruling has been reversed by the
Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, and as a result, the patent issues are returned to the District Court. In March&nbsp;2000, the District Court granted Intel's motion for summary judgment on
Intergraph's federal antitrust claims, and in April&nbsp;2000, Intergraph appealed this ruling. Intergraph's state law claims remain at issue in the trial court. The company disputes Intergraph's
claims and intends to defend the lawsuit vigorously. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>We
have been named to the California and U.S. Superfund lists for three of our sites and have completed, along with two other companies, a Remedial Investigation/Feasibility study with the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to evaluate the groundwater in areas adjacent to one of our former sites. The EPA has issued a Record of Decision with respect to a groundwater cleanup plan at
that site, including expected costs to complete. Under the California and U.S. Superfund statutes, liability for cleanup of this site and the adjacent area is joint and several. We, however, have
reached agreement with those same two companies that significantly limits our liabilities under the proposed cleanup plan. Also, we have completed extensive studies at our other sites and are engaged
in cleanup at several of these sites. In the opinion of management, including internal counsel, the potential losses to us in excess of amounts already accrued arising out of these matters would not
have a material adverse effect on our financial position or overall trends in results of operations, even if joint and several liability were to be assessed. </FONT></P>

</UL>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
are currently party to various legal proceedings, including those noted above. While management, including internal counsel, currently believes that the ultimate outcome of these
proceedings, individually and in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or overall trends in results of operations, litigation is subject to inherent
uncertainties. Were an unfavorable ruling to occur, there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on the net income of the period in which the ruling occurs. The estimate of the potential
impact on our financial position or overall results of operations for the above legal proceedings could change in the future. </FONT></P>
