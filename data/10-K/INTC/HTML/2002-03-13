<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are the world's largest semiconductor chip maker, supplying the computing and communications industries with chips, boards, systems and software building
blocks that are integral to computers, servers, and networking and communications products. We offer products at various levels of integration, allowing our customers to create advanced computing and
communications systems. Our mission is to be the preeminent building block supplier to the worldwide Internet economy. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our
component-level products consist of integrated circuits used to process information. Integrated circuits are silicon chips, known as semiconductors, etched with interconnected
electronic switches. Our developments in semiconductor design and manufacturing have made it possible to decrease the size of circuits etched into silicon, permitting more transistors to be used on
each individual chip or die. This generally allows for more chips to be made from each silicon wafer, resulting in smaller and faster microprocessors and other semiconductor products that consume less
power and cost less to manufacture. </FONT></P>

processes system data and controls other devices in the system, acting as the brains of the computer. One indicator of microprocessor performance is its clock speed, the rate at which its internal
logic operates, which is measured in units of hertz, or cycles processed per second. One megahertz (MHz) equals one million cycles processed per second, and one gigahertz (GHz) equals one billion
cycles processed per second. Other factors in chip performance include memory storage and access speed. The memory stored on a chip is measured in bytes, with 1,024 bytes equaling a kilobyte (KB),
1.049&nbsp;million bytes equaling a megabyte (MB) and 1.074&nbsp;billion bytes equaling a gigabyte (GB). Cache is a memory subsystem in which frequently used data is duplicated for quick access. A

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
2001, we began converting our microprocessor manufacturing from the 0.18-micron process technology to the 0.13-micron process technology. The width of
individual transistors on a chip is measured in microns; one micron equals one millionth of a meter. See the discussion of manufacturing process technologies under the heading "Manufacturing, Assembly
and Test" in Part&nbsp;I, Item 1 of this Form&nbsp;10-K. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
2001, we announced several new microprocessor products aimed at the various computing market segments ranging from value PCs (systems costing less than $800) to
high-performance workstations and servers. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Desktop platform.</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we exited 2001, the Pentium 4 processor became our highest volume desktop processor. The Pentium 4
processor is based on the Intel NetBurst microarchitecture, a collection of technologies that help deliver improved performance. These technologies are especially beneficial for creating and sharing
digital media, processing digital video and audio, displaying 3D graphics, and accessing a variety of Internet technologies, including streaming video, speech processing and other multimedia
processing tasks. Also, the Pentium 4 processor's 400-MHz system bus, the first in the industry, helps speed data transfer between the processor and main memory. During 2001, we introduced
four versions of the Pentium 4 processor running at speeds of 1.6 GHz to 2.0 GHz. In January&nbsp;2002, we introduced the first Pentium 4 processors built on our 0.13-micron
manufacturing process technology running at up to 2.2 GHz. This technology allows us to reduce the die size by 30% and double the size of the on-chip L2 cache memory, which enhances the
processor's performance. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
the value PC market segment, the Intel Celeron processor is designed to meet the core computing needs and affordability requirements common to many new PC users. During 2001, we
introduced seven new versions of the desktop Celeron processor running at speeds ranging from 800&nbsp;MHz to 1.2 GHz. The 800-MHz version, introduced in January&nbsp;2001, was our
first desktop value PC processor to incorporate a 100 MHz system bus. In October&nbsp;2001, we introduced the Intel Celeron processor running at 1.2 GHz, the first value PC processor made on our
0.13-micron process technology. It integrates 256 KB of on-chip L2 cache, which helps improve overall performance. In January&nbsp;2002, we introduced the Intel Celeron
processor running at 1.3 GHz, our fastest offering to date for the desktop value PC market segment. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mobile platform.</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We design our products to provide notebook and laptop PC users with the performance they need while meeting
the power consumption and size constraints of mobile PCs. As with our desktop processors, we offer mobile processors at a variety of price/performance points, allowing our OEM customers to meet the
demands of a wide range of notebook PC designs. These notebook designs include full size, thin and light, and ultra-portable. Within the ultra-portable design category, we provide specialized low
voltage processors, which consume as little as one watt of power on average, and ultra low voltage processors, which consume as little as half a watt of power on average. Low voltage processors are
targeted for the mini-notebook market segment while ultra low voltage processors are targeted for the sub-notebook market segment of mobile PCs weighing less than three pounds
and measuring one inch in height. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During
2001, we introduced 29 mobile processors, providing solutions across a wide range of market segments. We introduced the Mobile Intel Pentium III Processor-M at speeds
of up to 1.2 GHz; the low voltage mobile Pentium III processor running at up to 800 MHz; and the ultra low voltage Mobile Pentium III processor running at up to 700 MHz. Our Mobile Intel Pentium III
processor features Intel&reg; SpeedStep&#153; technology. When the user is disconnected from an AC power source, this technology allows the processor to switch automatically to a lower
voltage and clock speed, extending the system's battery life. When the user plugs into an outlet or docking station, the chip automatically resumes full speed. We also introduced mobile Celeron
processors ranging from 733 to 933 MHz, </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
March&nbsp;2002, we introduced the Mobile Intel Pentium 4 processor-M running at speeds up to 1.7&nbsp;GHz. This new processor is designed to enable both consumer and
business users to take full advantage of processing-intensive applications such as audio and video encoding, digital imaging, speech recognition, 3D content creation, games, multimedia and
multi-tasking environments. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Server and workstation platforms.</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2001, we expanded our server product offerings in order to provide building blocks for
solutions across a wide range of server market segments. In September&nbsp;2001, we began shipping in volume Intel Pentium III Xeon processors for use in high-performance multiprocessing
servers, which typically use between four and eight processors per system. These
processors are also being used in servers with up to 32 processors. The Intel Pentium III Xeon processors running at 900 MHz feature 2 MB of on-die L2 cache. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For
the workstation market segment, in May&nbsp;2001, we introduced the first generation of Intel Xeon processors based on the Intel NetBurst microarchitecture, running at speeds of up
to 1.7 GHz. These processors are targeted for high-performance and mid-range, dual-processor workstations. In September&nbsp;2001, we introduced a 2.0 GHz version
of the Intel Xeon processor based on the Intel NetBurst microarchitecture. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
October&nbsp;2001, we introduced several new server building block products&#151;boards, chassis and other server components&#151;designed to help OEM system builders
and product integrators build their servers around Intel processors. We designed seven server board and server chassis products to meet the specifications of a wide range of computing applications,
from high-density, rack-mount server environments to e-mail servers, print servers and database servers. </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
November&nbsp;2001, we introduced a new ultra low voltage processor line for low power consumption, space-saving, "ultra-dense" servers. Ultra-dense servers are increasingly used in
enterprise data centers and by Internet service providers to offer Web serving, firewall protection and Web caching. Our ultra low voltage Pentium III processor at 700 MHz runs at 1.1 volts, and
includes 512&nbsp;KB of on-chip cache memory. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
December&nbsp;2001, we introduced our first server building block products aimed at the telecommunications server market segment. These carrier-grade products conform to stringent
international telecommunications industry reliability requirements. They are designed to function in cold, fires, excessive heat and other extreme conditions. For this category, we offer
dual-processor server platforms in 1U and 2U form factors (1U is a standard unit of measurement of 1.75 inches, used to describe the height of the system chassis). These systems are
designed for carriers, telecommunications service providers and large corporations for use in core telecommunications and wireless infrastructure for high-speed, high-traffic
networks. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
February&nbsp;2002, we introduced the first Intel Xeon processor for servers, featuring Hyper-Threading technology and the Intel Netburst microarchitecture. Hyper-Threading is a new
design that allows a single processor to manage data as if it were two processors by handling data instructions in parallel rather than one at a time. The new server platform can boost system
performance for two-way systems significantly when compared against Intel-based platforms running on Pentium III Xeon processors. These systems are available at speeds of up to 2.2 GHz. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
also continued to advance our 64-bit processor for high-end servers and workstations, the Intel Itanium processor. This processor employs a new design
philosophy called EPIC, Explicitly Parallel Instruction Computing. The Intel Itanium architecture combines a high degree of parallel computing with 64-bit addressing and extensive
reliability features, for use in data-intensive applications, such as
enterprise resource planning and intensive graphics modeling. In June&nbsp;2001, we announced a multi-year agreement with Compaq Computer Corporation in which Compaq will transition its

have thousands of suppliers providing our various material and service needs. We seek, where possible, to have several sources of supply for everything, but on limited occasions we
may rely on a single or limited number of suppliers. In those cases, we develop and implement plans and actions to minimize the exposure that would result from a disruption at that supplier. We also
typically have multiple factories at multiple sites around the world producing our leading and highest margin products. However, some other products are only produced in one factory, and again we
seek, through other actions and plans, to minimize the exposure that would result from a disruption at that factory. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Manufacturing
of integrated circuits is a complex process. Normal manufacturing risks include errors and interruptions in the production process, defects in raw materials and disruptions
at suppliers, as well as other risks, all of which can affect yields. A substantial decrease in yields would result in higher manufacturing costs and the possibility of not being able to produce
sufficient volume to meet specific product demand. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
general, if we were unable to manufacture wafers or to assemble and test our products abroad, or if air transportation between our foreign facilities and the United States were
disrupted, there could be a material adverse effect on our operations. In addition to normal risks associated with manufacturing, assembly and test, our operations outside the United States are
subject to certain additional exposures. These risks include currency controls and fluctuations; tariff, import and other related restrictions and regulations; possible disruption in commercial
activities related to terrorist activity and armed conflict in the United States, Israel and other locations; and civil or military unrest or political instability in a locale. To date, we have not
experienced significant difficulties related to these foreign business risks. </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following
the attacks on the World Trade Center in New York City, property insurance underwriters deleted terrorism coverage from their policies. We are exploring specialty markets that
offer this coverage, however, the cost may be prohibitive. In addition, our property insurance coverage levels have decreased and our retained risk exposure from uninsured losses has increased. We
have not made any material change to our operations as a result of the reduced coverage. Availability and cost of coverage have historically changed as the insurance industry reacted to various market
forces and we will consider purchasing additional coverage if and when the availability and pricing become more favorable. </FONT></P>

also use industrial and retail distributors and representatives to distribute our products worldwide. Typically, distributors handle a wide variety of products, including those that
compete with our products, and fill orders for many customers. Most of our sales to distributors are made under agreements allowing for price protection on unsold merchandise and right of return on
stipulated quantities of unsold merchandise. Sales representatives generally do not offer directly competitive products but may carry complementary items manufactured by others. Representatives do not
maintain a product inventory; instead, their customers place orders directly with us or through distributors. We conducted business with more than 2,000 customers worldwide in 2001, including
customers of our acquired companies, and sales to one customer, Dell Computer Corporation, contributed approximately 14% to our total sales in 2001. A substantial majority of the sales to this
customer consisted of Intel Architecture products. No other customer accounted for more than 10% of our total revenues. Sales to our five largest customers accounted for approximately 38% of total
revenues. The information regarding revenues and operating profit by reportable segments and revenues from unaffiliated customers by geographic region under the heading "Operating segment and
geographic information" on pages 35 and 36 of our 2001 Annual Report to Stockholders, is incorporated by reference. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B><I>BACKLOG  </I></B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our sales are made primarily pursuant to standard purchase orders for delivery of standard products. We have some agreements that give a customer the right to
purchase a specific number of products during a specified time period. Although not generally obligating the customer to purchase any particular number of such products, some of these agreements do
contain billback clauses. Under these clauses, customers who do not purchase the full volume agreed to are liable for billback on previous shipments up to the price appropriate for the quantity
actually purchased. As a matter of industry practice, billback clauses are difficult to enforce. The quantity actually purchased by the customer, as well as the shipment schedules, are frequently
revised during the agreement term to reflect changes in the customer's needs. In light of industry practice and experience, we do not believe that such agreements are meaningful for determining
backlog amounts. We believe that only a small portion of our order backlog is noncancellable and that the dollar amount associated with the noncancellable portion is not material. Therefore, we do not
believe that backlog as of any particular date is indicative of future results. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B><I>COMPETITION  </I></B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our goal is to be the preeminent building block supplier to the worldwide Internet economy. Our primary focus areas are the desktop, mobile and server platforms,
and networking and communications platform including wireless communications, as well as new business opportunities around the Internet. In each of these market segments, we compete, to various
degrees, on the basis of functionality, performance, quality, price and availability. We are engaged in a rapidly advancing field of technology in which our ability to compete depends on our ability
to improve our products and processes, develop new products to meet changing customer requirements and reduce costs. Prices decline rapidly in the semiconductor industry as unit volumes grow, further
competition develops and production experience is accumulated. Many companies compete with us in the various computing, networking and communications market segments, and are engaged in the same basic
fields of activity, including research and development. Worldwide, these competitors range in size from large multinational companies to smaller companies competing in specialized market segments. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Intel Architecture business consists of the Desktop Platforms Group, the Mobile Platforms Group and the Enterprise Platforms Group. Our strategy for the desktop and mobile platforms
is to introduce ever-higher performance microprocessors and chipsets, developed for different market segments of the worldwide computing market, using a tiered branding approach. Our

various market segments. In line with our strategies, we seek to develop higher performance microprocessors based on the Intel NetBurst microarchitecture specifically for each computing market
segment. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our
financial results are substantially dependent on sales of microprocessors by the Intel Architecture operating segment. A number of competitors market software-compatible products
intended to compete with Intel architecture-based processors. We also face significant competition from companies offering rival microprocessor architectures. The Celeron processor competes with
existing and future products in the highly competitive value PC market segment. The Pentium 4 processor competes with existing and future products in the performance desktop and entry-level
workstation market segment. The Mobile Intel Pentium 4 processor competes with existing and future products in the mobile computing market segment. We have experienced an increase in the competitive
product offerings in the performance desktop market segment and recently in the mobile market segment. The Pentium III Xeon processor based on the P6 architecture and the Intel Xeon processor based on
the Intel Netburst architecture compete in the mid-range and high-end server and workstation market segments. The Intel Itanium processor competes in the enterprise-class
server market segment. These three processors all compete with established products based on rival architectures. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many
of our competitors are licensed to use our patents. Furthermore, our competitors can design competing products and avoid our patent rights by using certain foundry services that
have broad licenses with us that, under current case law, permit them to pass our patent rights on to others. Competitors' products may add features, increase performance or sell at lower prices. We
cannot predict whether our products will continue to compete successfully with such existing rival architectures or whether new architectures will establish or gain market acceptance or provide
increased competition with our products. Future distortion of price maturity curves could occur if software-compatible products enter the market segment in significant volume or alternative
architectures gain market acceptance. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
plan to cultivate new businesses as well as continue to work with the computing industry to expand Internet capabilities and product offerings, and develop compelling software
applications that can take advantage of higher performance microprocessors and chipsets, increasing demand for Intel's newer products in each computing market segment. We may continue to take various
steps, including reducing microprocessor prices and/or offering rebates and other incentives at such times as we deem appropriate, in order to increase acceptance of our latest technology and to
remain competitive within each relevant market segment. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
the Intel Communications Group, our strategy for the networking and communications platform is based on three focus areas: Ethernet connectivity, optical components and network
processing components. In the these areas, we face competition from both established and emerging companies and competitors use aggressive product and acquisition plans in an effort to achieve
leading-edge market positions. Our products also compete in the small and mid-sized enterprise market segments with established products and leading edge Internet
communications systems and server products. We cannot predict whether our networking and communications products will continue to compete successfully with products from existing competitors or
products from new entrants to these market segments. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
the wireless communications business, our strategy is to deliver complete solutions that enable quick deployment of applications and services for wireless Internet and personal
information devices. For these segments, we offer flash memory products, processors based on the Intel StrongARM processor and Intel Xscale&#153; microarchitecture and baseband chipsets. In
supplying these products, our Wireless
Communications and Computing Group faces competition from the products of established companies in the flash memory market segment. We cannot predict whether our products will continue </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B><I>RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT  </I></B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have maintained our competitive position to a large extent because of our emphasis on research and development. This emphasis has enabled us to deliver
leading-edge technology and has permitted our customers to commit to the use of these new products in the development of their own products. Our research and development activities are
directed toward developing new products; hardware technologies; manufacturing, packaging and testing processes, as well as improving existing products and lowering costs. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
perform a substantial majority of the design and development of components and other products in the United States at our facilities in California, Oregon, Arizona and Washington.
Outside the United States, we have product development facilities at various locations, including Israel, Malaysia, India, China and Russia. We also maintain research and development facilities in
California and Oregon that are focused on improving manufacturing processes, as well as a facility in Arizona that is dedicated to improvements in manufacturing, assembly and test processes. </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During
the second quarter of 2001, our customers began shipping servers and workstations based on the Intel Itanium processor, the first in the family of our 64-bit Itanium
architecture products. The introduction of the Itanium processor is an important technology landmark for both the end user and IT supplier community. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During
the third quarter of 2001, we announced two technology breakthroughs, including the TeraHertz transistor and Hyper-Threading technology. Based on new structures and materials, a
TeraHertz transistor is designed to overcome a number of the technical barriers to continued industry progress according to what is referred to as "Moore's Law". Moore's Law has accurately predicted
that the number of transistors that can be placed on a computer chip will double approximately every couple of years. When used in future technology generations, TeraHertz transistors are expected to
enable chips with 25 times the number of transistors of today's microprocessors, operating at 10 times the speed, with no increase in power consumption or heat dissipation. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hyper-Threading
technology is a new processor design that we expect will significantly improve system performance for servers. Our simultaneous multi-threading design allows a single
processor to manage data as if it were two processors by handling data instructions in parallel rather than one at a time. Using Hyper-Threading technology, data instructions are "threaded" as
parallel streams for processing. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
September&nbsp;2001, we announced the creation of new organization called the Corporate Technology Group (CTG), which will provide research and technology direction across product
lines, and will work with the industry to create and deliver key industry specifications, standards and technologies. As part of the creation of CTG, we also announced the appointment a Chief
Technology Officer. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
addition to microprocessor and chipset research and development, we have research and development initiatives in networking and communications products, wireless devices, connected
peripherals and other areas. These research and development initiatives include projects surrounding the Intel IXA architecture for networking and communications products and the Intel PCA
architecture for wireless devices. We have also acquired ongoing research and development activities in these areas with businesses acquired in 2001. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our
expenditures for research and development were $3,796&nbsp;million in fiscal 2001, $3,897&nbsp;million in fiscal 2000 and $3,111&nbsp;million in fiscal 1999. These amounts
exclude charges for purchased in-process research and development related to acquisitions of $198&nbsp;million for fiscal 2001, $109&nbsp;million for fiscal </FONT></P>

2000 and $392&nbsp;million for fiscal 1999. The decline in spending between 2001 and 2000 reflects the impact of cost containment programs including reductions in discretionary spending on
travel-related expenses. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At
December&nbsp;2001, we had approximately 21,000 employees engaged in research and development. The success of our research and development activities is dependent upon competitive
circumstances as well as our ability to bring new products to market in each computing market segment and in our other businesses in a timely and cost-effective manner. </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2><B><I>ACQUISITIONS AND STRATEGIC INVESTMENTS  </I></B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During 2001, we acquired 11 businesses for more than $1.7&nbsp;billion, augmenting our capabilities in a number of strategic areas. The companies acquired
included Xircom, VxTel, LightLogic and Cognet, which are discussed under the "Products" heading in Part&nbsp;I, Item 1 of this Form&nbsp;10-K in connection with the Intel
Communications Group. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under
our Intel Capital program, we also make equity investments to further our strategic objectives and to support our key business initiatives for the desktop and mobile platforms,
server platforms, networking and communications, and Internet services. We want to stimulate growth in computing, communications and the Internet, and to grow the total information infrastructure, in
order to create and expand markets for our products. This strategic investment program helps advance our overall mission to be the preeminent supplier of building blocks to the worldwide Internet
economy. Our
strategic investment program seeks to invest in companies that can succeed and have an impact on their market segment. When the strategic objectives of an investment have been achieved, or if the
investment diverges from our strategic objectives, we may decide to dispose of the investment. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At
December&nbsp;29, 2001, our strategic investment portfolio was valued at approximately $1.7&nbsp;billion. A majority of the portfolio was comprised of non-marketable
equity securities. Our ability to recover our investments in non-marketable equity securities and to earn a return on these investments is largely dependent on equity market conditions and
the occurrence of liquidity events, such as initial public offerings, mergers and private sales. All of these factors are difficult to predict, particularly in the current economic environment. In
addition, under our accounting policy, we are required to review all of our investments for impairment. For non-marketable equity securities, this requires significant judgment, including
assessment of the investees' financial condition, the existence of subsequent rounds of financing and the impact of any relevant contractual preferences, as well as the investees' historical results
of operations, and projected results of cash flows. </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2><B><I>INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND LICENSING  </I></B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Intellectual property rights that apply to our various products and services include patents, copyrights, trade secrets, trademarks and mask work rights. Intel
has established an active program to protect its investment in technology by enforcing its intellectual property rights. We do not intend to license our intellectual property rights broadly unless we
can obtain adequate consideration. See also the information under the heading "Competition" in Part&nbsp;I, Item 1 of this Form&nbsp;10-K. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
have filed and obtained a number of patents in the United States and abroad, and we have entered into patent cross-license agreements with many of our major competitors and other
parties. While our intellectual property rights are important to our success, our business as a whole is not materially dependent on any particular patent or license. We and other companies in the
computer, telecommunications and related high-technology fields typically apply for and receive, in the aggregate, thousands of patents annually in the United States and other countries.
In addition, because of the fast pace of innovation and product development, our products are often obsolete before the patents related to them expire. As a result, we believe that the duration of the
applicable patents is adequate relative to the expected lives of our products. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As
of December&nbsp;29, 2001, we also leased 79 major facilities in the United States totaling approximately 3,047,000 square feet and 62 facilities in other countries totaling
approximately 2,122,000 square feet. These leases expire at varying dates through 2019 and include renewals at our option. Leased facilities increased in 2001, primarily due to the addition of
properties leased by companies acquired by Intel. We believe that our existing facilities are suitable and adequate for our present purposes, and that the productive capacity in such facilities is
substantially being utilized or we have plans to utilize it. In addition, we completed the phase-out of our manufacturing operations at a 426,000 square foot facility in Puerto Rico, and
we are seeking to dispose of this facility. We also have approximately 2.2&nbsp;million square feet of building space in the United States and approximately 1.8&nbsp;million square feet of
building space in various international sites under various stages of construction for manufacturing, assembly and test and administrative purposes. For information regarding environmental proceedings
related to certain facilities, see the information under the heading "Legal Proceedings" in Part&nbsp;I, Item 3 of this Form&nbsp;10-K. </FONT></P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><FONT SIZE=2><I>Intergraph Corporation v. Intel<BR>
U.S. District Court, Northern District of Alabama, Northeastern Division<BR>
U.S. District Court, Eastern District of Texas</I></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
November&nbsp;1997, Intergraph Corporation filed suit in Federal District Court in Alabama, generally alleging that Intel attempted to coerce Intergraph into relinquishing certain
patent rights. The suit alleges that Intel infringes five Intergraph microprocessor-related patents and includes alleged violations of antitrust laws and various state law claims. The suit seeks
injunctive relief, damages and prejudgment interest, and further alleges that Intel's infringement is willful and that any damages awarded should be trebled. Intergraph's expert witness has claimed
that Intergraph is entitled to damages of approximately $2.2&nbsp;billion for Intel's alleged patent infringement and approximately $350&nbsp;million for alleged state law violations, plus
prejudgment interest. Intel has counterclaimed, alleging infringement of seven Intel patents, breach of contract and misappropriation of trade secrets. In March&nbsp;2000, the District Court granted
Intel's motion for summary judgment on Intergraph's federal antitrust claims, and in June&nbsp;2001, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit sustained the District Court's ruling.
Intergraph's patent and state law claims remain at issue in the trial court. The company disputes the plaintiff's claims and intends to defend the lawsuit vigorously. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
August&nbsp;2001, Intergraph filed a second suit in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas, alleging that the Intel Itanium processor infringes two Intergraph
microprocessor-related patents, and seeking an injunction and unspecified damages. Intergraph has withdrawn its request for damages and, consequently, Intergraph's sole requested remedy is an
injunction that would prohibit Intel from making, using or selling Itanium processors. If granted, such an injunction would significantly limit Intel's ability to succeed in the enterprise server
market segment for 64-bit processors. The Texas suit is currently scheduled for trial before Judge Ward, sitting without a jury, in July&nbsp;2002. The company disputes plaintiff's
claims and intends to defend the lawsuits vigorously. </FONT></P>

U.S. District Court, Northern California</I></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On
May&nbsp;1, 2000, various plaintiffs filed a class-action lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, alleging violations of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 and U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Rule&nbsp;14d-10 in connection with Intel's acquisition of DSP Communications,&nbsp;Inc. The complaint alleges
that Intel and CWC (Intel's wholly owned subsidiary at the time) agreed to pay certain DSP Communications insiders additional consideration of $15.6&nbsp;million not offered or paid to other
stockholders. The alleged purpose of this payment to the insiders was to obtain DSP Communications insiders' endorsement of Intel's tender offer in violation of the anti-discrimination
provision of Section&nbsp;14(d)(7) and Rule&nbsp;14d-10. The plaintiffs are seeking unspecified damages for the class, and unspecified costs and expenses. The suit is currently
scheduled for trial in July&nbsp;2002; however, the presiding judge has retired and the case has been reassigned. The company disputes the plaintiffs' claims and intends to defend the lawsuit
vigorously. </FONT></P>

September&nbsp;10, 2001, VIA Technologies,&nbsp;Inc. and Centaur Technology,&nbsp;Inc. sued Intel in the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas, alleging

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
September, October and November&nbsp;2001, various plaintiffs filed lawsuits against Intel alleging violations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The five class-action
complaints allege that purchasers of Intel stock between July&nbsp;19, 2000 and September&nbsp;29, 2000 were misled by false and misleading statements by Intel and certain of its officers and
directors concerning the company's business and financial condition. In addition, stockholder derivative complaints have been filed in California Superior Court and Delaware Chancery Court against the
company's directors and certain officers, alleging that they have mismanaged the company and otherwise breached their fiduciary obligations to the company. All complaints seek unspecified damages. The
company disputes the plaintiffs' claims and intends to defend the lawsuits vigorously. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
currently are a party to various legal proceedings, including those noted above. While management, including internal counsel, currently believes that the ultimate outcome of these
proceedings, individually and in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or overall trends in results of operations, litigation is subject to inherent
uncertainties. Were an unfavorable ruling to occur, there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on the net income of the period in which the ruling occurs. The estimate of the potential
impact on our financial position or overall results of operations for the above legal proceedings could change in the future. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B><I>B. ENVIRONMENTAL PROCEEDINGS  </I></B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have been named to the California and U.S. Superfund lists for three of our sites and have completed, along with two other companies, a Remedial
Investigation/Feasibility study with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to evaluate the groundwater in areas adjacent to one of our former sites. The EPA has issued a Record of Decision
with respect to a groundwater cleanup plan at that site, including expected costs to complete. Under the California and U.S. Superfund statutes, liability for cleanup of this site and the adjacent
area is joint and several. We have reached agreement, however, with those same two companies that significantly limits our liabilities under the proposed cleanup plan. In addition, we have completed
extensive studies at our other sites and are engaged in cleanup at several of these sites. In the opinion of management, including internal counsel, the potential losses to us in excess of amounts
already accrued arising out of these matters would not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or overall trends in results of operations, even if joint and several liability were to
be assessed. </FONT></P>
