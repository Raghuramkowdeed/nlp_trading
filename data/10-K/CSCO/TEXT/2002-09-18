THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K

(REPORT), INCLUDING THE MANAGEMENTS

DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS WHICH IS INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE FROM CISCOS

2002 ANNUAL REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS, CONTAINS FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

REGARDING FUTURE EVENTS AND THE FUTURE RESULTS OF CISCO THAT ARE BASED ON

CURRENT EXPECTATIONS, ESTIMATES, FORECASTS, AND PROJECTIONS ABOUT THE

INDUSTRIES IN WHICH CISCO OPERATES AND THE BELIEFS AND ASSUMPTIONS OF THE

MANAGEMENT OF CISCO. WORDS SUCH AS EXPECTS, ANTICIPATES, TARGETS,

GOALS, PROJECTS, INTENDS, PLANS, BELIEVES, SEEKS, ESTIMATES,

VARIATIONS OF SUCH WORDS, AND SIMILAR EXPRESSIONS ARE INTENDED TO IDENTIFY SUCH

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS. THESE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS ARE ONLY

PREDICTIONS AND ARE SUBJECT TO RISKS, UNCERTAINTIES, AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT ARE

DIFFICULT TO PREDICT. THEREFORE, ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER MATERIALLY AND

ADVERSELY FROM THOSE EXPRESSED IN ANY FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS. FACTORS THAT

MIGHT CAUSE OR CONTRIBUTE TO SUCH DIFFERENCES INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO,

THOSE DISCUSSED IN THIS REPORT UNDER THE SECTION ENTITLED RISK FACTORS AND

ELSEWHERE, AND IN OTHER REPORTS CISCO FILES WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE

COMMISSION (SEC), SPECIFICALLY THE MOST RECENT REPORTS ON FORM 8-K AND FORM

10-Q, EACH AS IT MAY BE AMENDED FROM TIME TO TIME. CISCO UNDERTAKES NO OBLIGATION TO REVISE OR

UPDATE PUBLICLY ANY FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS FOR ANY REASON.

CISCO SYSTEMS, INC. (CISCO) MANUFACTURES AND SELLS NETWORKING AND

COMMUNICATIONS PRODUCTS AND PROVIDES SERVICES ASSOCIATED WITH THAT EQUIPMENT

AND ITS USE. ITS PRODUCTS ARE INSTALLED AT CORPORATIONS, PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS,

AND TELECOMMUNICATION COMPANIES, AND ARE ALSO FOUND IN SMALL AND MEDIUM-SIZED

COMMERCIAL ENTERPRISES. CISCO PROVIDES A BROAD LINE OF PRODUCTS FOR

TRANSPORTING DATA, VOICE, AND VIDEO WITHIN BUILDINGS, ACROSS CAMPUSES, OR

AROUND THE WORLD. CISCO CONDUCTS ITS BUSINESS GLOBALLY AND IS MANAGED

GEOGRAPHICALLY IN FOUR SEGMENTS: THE AMERICAS; EUROPE, THE MIDDLE EAST, AND

AFRICA (EMEA); ASIA PACIFIC; AND JAPAN (SEE NOTE 12, SEGMENT INFORMATION AND

MAJOR CUSTOMERS, ON PAGES 46 AND 47 OF CISCOS 2002 ANNUAL REPORT TO

SHAREHOLDERS, WHICH IS INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE HEREIN).

CISCO WAS INCORPORATED IN CALIFORNIA IN DECEMBER 1984 AND IS HEADQUARTERED IN

SAN JOSE. CISCOS HEADQUARTERS MAILING ADDRESS IS 170 WEST TASMAN DRIVE, SAN

JOSE, CALIFORNIA, 95134-1706, AND THE TELEPHONE NUMBER AT THAT LOCATION IS

(408) 526-4000. THE CISCO WEB SITE IS WWW.CISCO.COM.

PRODUCTS AND SERVICES

CISCO SELLS SCALABLE, STANDARDS-BASED NETWORKING PRODUCTS THAT COVER A WIDE

RANGE OF CUSTOMERS NETWORKING NEEDS. CISCOS PRODUCTS AND SERVICES HELP

CUSTOMERS BUILD THEIR OWN NETWORK INFRASTRUCTURE WHILE ALSO PROVIDING TOOLS TO

ALLOW THEM TO COMMUNICATE WITH THEIR CUSTOMERS, PROSPECTS, BUSINESS PARTNERS,

SUPPLIERS, AND EMPLOYEES.

PRODUCTS ARE USED INDIVIDUALLY OR IN COMBINATIONS TO CONNECT COMPUTING DEVICES

TO NETWORKS OR COMPUTER NETWORKS WITH EACH OTHER  WHETHER THEY ARE WITHIN A

BUILDING, ACROSS A CAMPUS, OR AROUND THE WORLD. CISCOS BREADTH OF PRODUCT AND

SERVICE OFFERINGS ENABLES IT TO OFFER A WIDE

3

RANGE OF PRODUCTS AND SERVICES TO MEET CUSTOMER REQUIREMENTS. CISCO ALSO

PROVIDES PRODUCTS AND SERVICES THAT ALLOW CUSTOMERS TO TRANSITION THEIR VARIOUS

NETWORKS TO A SINGLE MULTISERVICE DATA, VOICE, AND VIDEO NETWORK.

OVER TIME, CISCO BELIEVES THAT THE INTERNET AND THE VARIOUS NETWORKS ASSOCIATED

WITH IT, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO CORPORATE INTRANETS, CABLE, BROADBAND AND

DIALUP NETWORKS, AND VOICE AND VIDEO NETWORKS, WILL CONVERGE INTO A NETWORK OF

NETWORKS. IN THAT ENVIRONMENT, THE SUCCESSFUL VENDORS WILL BE THOSE CAPABLE

OF PROVIDING AN END-TO-END SPECTRUM OF PRODUCTS AIMED NOT AT A PARTICULAR

TECHNOLOGY PLATFORM BUT AT SOLUTIONS TO NETWORKING PROBLEMS WHICH CUT ACROSS

THE SEGMENTATION THAT CURRENTLY DEFINES THE INDUSTRY. AS SUCH, A LARGE PART OF

CISCOS STRATEGIC INITIATIVES AND INVESTMENTS IS AIMED AT MEETING THE

REQUIREMENTS THAT SUCH A NETWORK OF NETWORKS WOULD DEMAND. FOR A DISCUSSION OF

THE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THAT STRATEGY, PLEASE SEE THE PORTION OF THIS REPORT

ENTITLED RISK FACTORS, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE RISK FACTOR ENTITLED,

WE DEPEND UPON THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW PRODUCTS AND ENHANCEMENTS TO EXISTING

PRODUCTS AND ARE SUBJECT TO RAPID CHANGES IN TECHNOLOGY AND THE MARKET.

CISCOS OFFERINGS FALL INTO SEVERAL CATEGORIES.

ROUTING

ROUTING IS A FOUNDATION TECHNOLOGY FOR COMPUTER NETWORKING. ROUTERS

INTERCONNECT COMPUTER NETWORKS AND MOVE INFORMATION FROM ONE NETWORK TO

ANOTHER. CISCOS ROUTING PRODUCTS OFFER FEATURES TO INCREASE SECURITY OF

TRANSMISSIONS AND INCREASE EFFICIENCY IN USE OF TRANSMISSION CAPACITY. WE

OFFER A BROAD RANGE OF ROUTERS FROM CORE BACKBONE INFRASTRUCTURE TO SMALL

OFFICE DEPLOYMENTS. IN ADDITION, CISCOS STORAGE NETWORKING PRODUCTS OFFER

CUSTOMERS A VARIETY OF OPTIONS IN ACCESSING AND INTERCONNECTING STORAGE

NETWORKS THAT CAN BE SHARED AND MANAGED GLOBALLY.

SWITCHING

SWITCHING IS ANOTHER INTEGRAL NETWORKING TECHNOLOGY THAT IS USED IN BOTH

LOCAL-AREA NETWORKS (LANS) AND WIDE-AREA NETWORKS (WANS). CISCOS SWITCHING

PRODUCTS ARE DESIGNED TO HELP USERS MIGRATE FROM TRADITIONAL SHARED LANS TO

FULLY SWITCHED NETWORKS. CISCO SOLUTIONS EMPLOY SEVERAL WIDELY USED SWITCHING

TECHNOLOGIES, INCLUDING ETHERNET, GIGABIT ETHERNET, TOKEN RING, AND

ASYNCHRONOUS TRANSFER MODE (ATM).

ACCESS

CISCO ACCESS PRODUCTS GIVE REMOTELY LOCATED GROUPS AND INDIVIDUALS SIMILAR

LEVELS OF CONNECTIVITY AND INFORMATION ACCESS TO ACHIEVE SEAMLESS CONNECTIONS

FOR USERS WHETHER THEY ARE LOCATED AT A COMPANYS HEAD OFFICE OR AT HOME OR

WHILE THEY ARE TRAVELING. ASYNCHRONOUS AND INTEGRATED SERVICES DIGITAL NETWORK

(ISDN) REMOTE-ACCESS ROUTERS, DIALUP ACCESS SERVERS, WIRELESS SOLUTIONS,

DIGITAL SUBSCRIBER LINE (DSL) TECHNOLOGIES, AND CABLE UNIVERSAL BROADBAND

ROUTERS PROVIDE TELECOMMUTERS, MOBILE WORKERS, AND STUDENTS WITH REMOTE NETWORK

ACCESS.

4

OTHER PRODUCTS

OTHER CISCO OFFERINGS INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING PRODUCTS.

IP TELEPHONY

CISCO PROVIDES IP TELEPHONY PRODUCTS FOR TRANSMITTING VOICE COMMUNICATIONS OVER

A NETWORK USING AN OPEN, STANDARDS-BASED INTERNET PROTOCOL. CISCOS IP

TELEPHONY PRODUCTS USE A SINGLE NETWORK INFRASTRUCTURE FOR THE TRANSMISSION OF

DATA, VOICE, AND VIDEO TRAFFIC TO DELIVER IP VOICE AND FULLY INTEGRATED

COMMUNICATIONS. IP TELEPHONY PRODUCTS PROVIDE A SEAMLESS MIGRATION TO FULL IP

COMMUNICATIONS BY INTEROPERATING WITH EXISTING SYSTEMS.

INTERNET NETWORK SERVICE AND SECURITY

CISCO OFFERS INTERNET NETWORK PRODUCTS AND SERVICES TO IMPROVE A NETWORK

MANAGERS ABILITY TO COPE WITH CHALLENGES POSED BY THE POPULARITY OF THE

INTERNET, SUCH AS NETWORK TRAFFIC VOLUME AND NETWORK ADDRESS SHORTAGES. CISCO

SEEKS TO ACHIEVE ARCHITECTURAL CONSISTENCY BY FOCUSING ON STANDARDS-BASED

SERVICES BETWEEN CLIENTS AND SERVERS SUCH AS END-TO-END QUALITY OF SERVICE

(QOS) AND END-TO-END SECURITY.

OPTICAL NETWORKING

CISCO PROVIDES OPTICAL NETWORKING PRODUCTS FOR BOTH THE ENTERPRISE AND SERVICE

PROVIDER MARKETS. ADVANCES IN NEXT-GENERATION SYNCHRONOUS OPTICAL

NETWORK/SYNCHRONOUS DIGITAL HIERARCHY (SONET/SDH) PROVIDE AN EVOLUTIONARY PATH

FOR TELECOMMUNICATIONS CARRIERS FROM THEIR EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURES, AS WELL AS

GIVING NEWER CARRIERS AND ENTERPRISES THE CAPABILITY TO DEPLOY COST-EFFECTIVE,

MULTISERVICE NETWORKS. CISCO ALSO USES OPTICAL TECHNOLOGIES SUCH AS DENSE WAVE

DIVISION MULTIPLEXING (DWDM) AND COARSE WAVE DIVISION MULTIPLEXING (CWDM) TO

SCALE OPTICAL BANDWIDTH AS HIGH-BANDWIDTH APPLICATIONS, SUCH AS GIGABIT

ETHERNET AND STORAGE, TO BECOME MORE COMMONPLACE.

NETWORK MANAGEMENT SOFTWARE

CISCOS NETWORK MANAGEMENT OFFERINGS ARE BUILT AROUND CISCOWORKS SOFTWARE, A

FAMILY OF MANAGEMENT APPLICATIONS BASED ON INTERNET STANDARDS. THESE TOOLS ARE

DESIGNED TO ENABLE CUSTOMERS TO BETTER SECURE, MONITOR, AND MANAGE LARGE,

COMPLEX NETWORKS. FOR SERVICE PROVIDERS, CISCO INTERNET OSS IS A FOUNDATION AND

FRAMEWORK DESIGNED FOR NEXT-GENERATION, INTERNET PROTOCOL (IP)-BASED SERVICES

AND PACKET NETWORK INFRASTRUCTURE. CISCO INTERNET OSS PROVIDES MANAGEMENT

ENABLEMENT OF INTELLIGENT NETWORK SERVICES.

THE TECHNOLOGIES OFFERED IN CONJUNCTION WITH PRODUCT OFFERINGS ARE CISCO AVVID

AND CISCO IOS® SOFTWARE. CISCO AVVID PROVIDES AN INTELLIGENT NETWORK

INFRASTRUCTURE FOR INTERNET BUSINESS SOLUTIONS AND CONSISTS OF SEVERAL

ARCHITECTURAL BUILDING BLOCKS FOR KEY INTERNET SERVICES. CISCO IOS SOFTWARE IS

A COMMON NETWORKING SOFTWARE PLATFORM DEPLOYED ACROSS A BROAD SPECTRUM OF CISCO

PRODUCTS.

5

SERVICE

IN ADDITION TO ITS PRODUCT OFFERINGS, CISCO PROVIDES A BROAD RANGE OF SERVICE

OFFERINGS, INCLUDING TECHNICAL MAINTENANCE SUPPORT AND CONSULTATIVE SERVICES,

TO ASSIST CUSTOMERS IN BUILDING AND MAINTAINING HIGH-AVAILABILITY NETWORKS, IN

KNOWLEDGE TRANSFER, AND IN BUILDING CUSTOMER SATISFACTION. CISCO SERVICES

PROVIDE DEVICE-LEVEL, NETWORK-LEVEL, AND APPLICATION-LEVEL SUPPORT FOR ALL

STAGES OF THE NETWORK LIFE CYCLE. THESE SERVICES HELP CUSTOMERS AND CHANNEL

PARTNERS BY ASSISTING THEM TO DEPLOY NEW TECHNOLOGIES, ACHIEVE

HIGH-AVAILABILITY NETWORKING, STREAMLINE BUSINESS PROCESSES, AND REDUCE

OPERATING COSTS.

CUSTOMERS AND MARKETS

NETWORKING NEEDS ARE INFLUENCED BY A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING THE SIZE OF

THE ORGANIZATION, NUMBER AND TYPES OF COMPUTER SYSTEMS, GEOGRAPHIC LOCATION,

AND THE APPLICATIONS REQUIRING COMMUNICATIONS. CISCOS CUSTOMER BASE IS NOT

CONCENTRATED IN ANY PARTICULAR INDUSTRY AND IN EACH OF THE PAST THREE FISCAL

YEARS, NO SINGLE CUSTOMER HAS ACCOUNTED FOR 10 PERCENT OR MORE OF CISCOS NET

SALES. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING SEGMENT INFORMATION, SEE NOTE 12,

SEGMENT INFORMATION AND MAJOR CUSTOMERS, ON PAGES 46 AND 47 OF CISCOS 2002

ANNUAL REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS, WHICH IS INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE HEREIN.

CISCOS CUSTOMERS ARE PRIMARILY IN THE FOLLOWING MARKETS.

LARGE ENTERPRISE BUSINESSES

LARGE ENTERPRISE BUSINESSES ARE GENERALLY DEFINED AS ORGANIZATIONS WITH 500 OR

MORE EMPLOYEES AND OFTEN HAVE COMPLEX NETWORKING NEEDS, AS WELL AS MULTIPLE

LOCATIONS, AND VARIOUS TYPES OF COMPUTER SYSTEMS. SUCH ENTERPRISE CUSTOMERS

INCLUDE CORPORATIONS, GOVERNMENT AGENCIES, UTILITIES, AND EDUCATIONAL

INSTITUTIONS. CISCO PRODUCTS FOR THESE CUSTOMERS INCLUDE THOSE DESIGNED FOR

ENTERPRISE ROUTING, SWITCHING, SECURITY, AND IP TELEPHONY.

SERVICE PROVIDERS

SERVICE PROVIDERS OFFER DATA, VOICE, AND/OR VIDEO COMMUNICATION SERVICES TO

BUSINESSES, GOVERNMENTS, UTILITIES, AND CONSUMERS. THEY INCLUDE REGIONAL,

NATIONAL, AND INTERNATIONAL TELECOMMUNICATIONS CARRIERS, AS WELL AS INTERNET,

CABLE, AND WIRELESS SERVICE PROVIDERS. MANY SERVICE PROVIDERS RESELL CISCO

PRODUCTS TO THEIR OWN RESIDENTIAL, ENTERPRISE, OR COMMERCIAL CUSTOMERS. THESE

CUSTOMERS USE A VARIETY OF CISCO SWITCHING, ROUTING, AND MANAGEMENT PRODUCTS IN

THEIR NETWORKS. COMPARED TO OTHER END-USER CUSTOMERS, SERVICE PROVIDER

CUSTOMERS ARE MORE LIKELY TO REQUIRE NETWORK DESIGN SERVICES, AND THEIR

BUSINESS IS CHARACTERIZED BY LONG DESIGN CYCLES. HISTORICALLY, SERVICE

PROVIDERS RELIED ON EQUIPMENT SUPPLIERS TO TAKE GREATER RESPONSIBILITY FOR

IMPLEMENTATION OF TURNKEY SOLUTIONS OR TO ACT AS PRIME CONTRACTORS IN DEPLOYING

NETWORK SOLUTIONS, WITH IMPLICATIONS FOR TIMING OF REVENUE RECOGNITION. THE

LARGE NUMBER OF NEW ENTRANTS TO THIS BUSINESS IN THE LATE 1990S, AND THE

EVENTUAL LACK OF SUFFICIENT CUSTOMER DEMAND FOR TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICES TO

MEET THE BUSINESS PLANS OF ALL ENTRANTS, HAS LED TO A CONDITION OF OVERSUPPLY,

LEADING MANY SERVICE PROVIDERS TO CEASE OPERATIONS, AND THE REMAINING

6

COMPANIES, PARTICULARLY IN THE UNITED STATES, TO SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE PROJECTED

AND ACTUAL TECHNOLOGY-RELATED CAPITAL EXPENDITURES.

COMMERCIAL

COMMERCIAL CUSTOMERS, PRIMARILY SMALL AND MEDIUM-SIZED BUSINESSES, HAVE FEWER

THAN 500 EMPLOYEES AND A NEED FOR NETWORKS OF THEIR OWN, AS WELL AS CONNECTION

TO THE INTERNET AND TO BUSINESS PARTNERS. HOWEVER, THESE CUSTOMERS GENERALLY

HAVE LIMITED RESOURCES AND EXPERTISE IN NETWORKING TECHNOLOGY. THEREFORE,

CISCO ATTEMPTS TO PROVIDE PRODUCTS THAT ARE AFFORDABLE AND EASY TO INSTALL AND

USE. THE COMMERCIAL MARKET REMAINS AN AREA OF POTENTIAL GROWTH FOR NETWORK

ADOPTION AND DEPLOYMENT OF INTELLIGENT NETWORK SOLUTIONS. THE EMERGING

MARKETS, WHICH INCLUDE NETWORK SECURITY, MOBILITY, AND CONVERGED VOICE AND DATA

SOLUTIONS, ARE OF SPECIFIC INTEREST TO SMALL AND MEDIUM-SIZED BUSINESSES. CISCO

ALSO WORKS TO SET STANDARDS FOR THE CONSUMER MARKET THROUGH THE INTERNET HOME

ALLIANCE.

CISCO SALES OVERVIEW

CISCOS WORLDWIDE SALES AND MARKETING ORGANIZATION, AT JULY 27, 2002, CONSISTED

OF APPROXIMATELY 14,000 INDIVIDUALS, INCLUDING MANAGERS, SALES REPRESENTATIVES,

AND TECHNICAL SUPPORT PERSONNEL. CISCO HAS FIELD SALES OFFICES IN MORE THAN 60

COUNTRIES AND SELLS ITS PRODUCTS AND SERVICES BOTH DIRECTLY AND THROUGH CHANNEL

PARTNERS WITH SUPPORT FROM ITS SALES FORCE. CHANNEL PARTNERS INCLUDE

DISTRIBUTORS, VALUE-ADDED RESELLERS, SYSTEM INTEGRATORS, AND SERVICE PROVIDERS.

THE SYSTEM INTEGRATORS AND VALUE-ADDED RESELLERS BUYING THROUGH DISTRIBUTORS

OFTEN PROVIDE SYSTEM INSTALLATION, TECHNICAL SUPPORT, AND FOLLOW-UP SERVICES TO

THE END CUSTOMERS. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING CISCOS SALES, SEE

NOTE 12, SEGMENT INFORMATION AND MAJOR CUSTOMERS, ON PAGES 46 AND 47 OF

CISCOS 2002 ANNUAL REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS, WHICH IS INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE

HEREIN.

CISCOS SERVICE OFFERINGS COMPLEMENT ITS PRODUCTS VIA A RANGE OF CONSULTING,

TECHNICAL, PROJECT, QUALITY, AND MAINTENANCE SUPPORT-LEVEL SERVICES INCLUDING

24X7 ONLINE AND TELEPHONE SUPPORT THROUGH TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE CENTERS.

CISCO SYSTEMS CAPITAL CORPORATION FACILITATES AND PROVIDES LEASE AND OTHER

FINANCING TO CERTAIN QUALIFIED CUSTOMERS FOR THE PURCHASE OF EQUIPMENT AND

OTHER NEEDS. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING CISCO SYSTEMS CAPITAL

CORPORATIONS FINANCING ACTIVITIES, SEE NOTE 6, LEASE RECEIVABLES, NET, ON

PAGE 37 OF CISCOS 2002 ANNUAL REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS, WHICH IS INCORPORATED BY

REFERENCE HEREIN.

ACQUISITIONS, INVESTMENTS, AND ALLIANCES

THE MARKETS IN WHICH CISCO COMPETES REQUIRE A WIDE VARIETY OF TECHNOLOGIES,

PRODUCTS, AND CAPABILITIES. THE COMBINATION OF COMPLEXITY AND RAPID CHANGE

MAKE IT DIFFICULT FOR ONE COMPANY, NO MATTER HOW LARGE, TO DEVELOP ALL

TECHNOLOGICAL SOLUTIONS ALONE. THROUGH ACQUISITIONS, INVESTMENTS, AND

ALLIANCES CISCO IS ABLE TO DELIVER PRODUCTS AND SERVICES TO CUSTOMERS IN TARGET

MARKETS.

CISCO EMPLOYS THE FOLLOWING STRATEGIES TO SATISFY THE NEED FOR NEW OR ENHANCED

NETWORKING PRODUCTS AND SOLUTIONS: DEVELOP NEW TECHNOLOGIES AND PRODUCTS

INTERNALLY; ENTER INTO JOINT-DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS WITH OTHER COMPANIES; RESELL

ANOTHER COMPANYS PRODUCT; OR ACQUIRE ALL OR PART OF ANOTHER COMPANY.

ACQUISITIONS

SINCE 1993, CISCO HAS ACQUIRED A NUMBER OF COMPANIES AND CISCO EXPECTS TO MAKE

FUTURE ACQUISITIONS. MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS OF HIGH-TECHNOLOGY COMPANIES ARE

INHERENTLY RISKY, ESPECIALLY IF NO PRODUCT HAS BEEN SHIPPED BY THE ACQUIRED

COMPANY. NO ASSURANCE CAN BE GIVEN THAT CISCOS PREVIOUS OR FUTURE ACQUISITIONS

WILL BE SUCCESSFUL OR WILL NOT MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT ITS FINANCIAL

CONDITION OR OPERATING RESULTS. PRIOR ACQUISITIONS HAVE RESULTED IN A WIDE

RANGE OF OUTCOMES, FROM SUCCESSFUL INTRODUCTION OF NEW PRODUCTS AND

TECHNOLOGIES TO AN INABILITY TO DO SO. THE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH ACQUISITIONS

ARE MORE FULLY DISCUSSED IN THE RISK FACTORS SECTION CONTAINED IN ITEM 1 OF

THIS REPORT.

INVESTMENTS IN PRIVATELY HELD COMPANIES

CISCO MAKES MINORITY INVESTMENTS IN PRIVATELY HELD COMPANIES THAT DEVELOP

TECHNOLOGY OR PROVIDE SERVICES THAT ARE COMPLEMENTARY TO CISCO PRODUCTS OR

PROVIDE STRATEGIC VALUE. BY INVESTING IN NEW VENTURES, CISCO STRENGTHENS ITS

RELATIONSHIPS WITH SUCH COMPANIES. THE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH ACQUISITIONS ARE

MORE FULLY DISCUSSED IN THE RISK FACTORS SECTION CONTAINED IN ITEM 1 OF THIS

REPORT.

STRATEGIC ALLIANCES

CISCO PURSUES STRATEGIC ALLIANCES WITH OTHER COMPANIES IN AREAS WHERE

COLLABORATION CAN PRODUCE INDUSTRY ADVANCEMENT AND ACCELERATION OF NEW MARKETS.

THE OBJECTIVES AND GOALS FOR A STRATEGIC ALLIANCE CAN INCLUDE ONE OR MORE OF

THE FOLLOWING: TECHNOLOGY EXCHANGE, PRODUCT AND SOLUTION DEVELOPMENT, JOINT

SALES AND MARKETING, OR NEW-MARKET CREATION. CURRENTLY, CISCO HAS ENTERED INTO

STRATEGIC ALLIANCES WITH CALLISMA, CAP GEMINI/ERNST & YOUNG, EDS,

HEWLETT-PACKARD/COMPAQ, IBM, INTEL, ITALTEL, KPMG CONSULTING, MICROSOFT,

MOTOROLA, ORACLE, SONY, AND SUN MICROSYSTEMS, AMONG OTHERS.

BACKLOG

CISCOS BACKLOG AT SEPTEMBER 9, 2002 WAS

APPROXIMATELY $1.4 BILLION, COMPARED

WITH A BACKLOG OF APPROXIMATELY $2.0 BILLION AT SEPTEMBER 14, 2001. WE INCLUDE

IN BACKLOG ONLY ORDERS CONFIRMED WITH A PURCHASE ORDER FOR PRODUCTS TO BE

SHIPPED WITHIN 90 DAYS TO CUSTOMERS WITH APPROVED CREDIT STATUS. BECAUSE OF

THE GENERALLY SHORT CYCLE BETWEEN ORDER AND SHIPMENT AND OCCASIONAL CUSTOMER

CHANGES IN DELIVERY SCHEDULES OR CANCELLATION OF ORDERS (WHICH ARE MADE WITHOUT

SIGNIFICANT PENALTY), CISCO DOES NOT BELIEVE THAT ITS BACKLOG, AS OF ANY

PARTICULAR DATE, IS NECESSARILY INDICATIVE OF ACTUAL NET SALES FOR ANY FUTURE

PERIOD.

COMPETITION

CISCO COMPETES IN THE NETWORKING AND COMMUNICATIONS EQUIPMENT MARKETS,

PROVIDING PRODUCTS AND SERVICES FOR TRANSPORTING DATA, VOICE, AND VIDEO TRAFFIC

ACROSS INTRANETS, EXTRANETS, AND THE INTERNET. THE MARKET IS CHARACTERIZED BY

RAPID CHANGE, CONVERGING TECHNOLOGIES, AND A MIGRATION TO NETWORKING SOLUTIONS

THAT OFFER SUPERIOR ADVANTAGES. THESE MARKET FACTORS REPRESENT BOTH AN

OPPORTUNITY AND A COMPETITIVE THREAT TO CISCO. CISCO COMPETES WITH NUMEROUS

VENDORS IN EACH PRODUCT CATEGORY. THE OVERALL NUMBER OF COMPETITORS PROVIDING

NICHE PRODUCT SOLUTIONS MAY INCREASE DUE TO THE MARKETS LONG-TERM ATTRACTIVE

GROWTH.

CISCOS COMPETITORS INCLUDE 3COM, ALCATEL, AVAYA, AVICI, CHECK POINT SOFTWARE,

CIENA, DELL, ERICSSON, ENTERASYS, EXTREME NETWORKS, FOUNDRY NETWORKS, FUJITSU,

HUAWEI, JUNIPER, LUCENT, MARCONI, NOKIA, NORTEL NETWORKS, REDBACK NETWORKS,

RIVERSTONE, SIEMENS AG, AND SYCAMORE NETWORKS, AMONG OTHERS. SOME OF THESE

COMPANIES COMPETE ACROSS MANY OF CISCOS PRODUCT LINES, WHILE OTHERS ARE

PRIMARILY FOCUSED IN A SPECIFIC PRODUCT AREA. BARRIERS TO ENTRY ARE RELATIVELY

LOW, AND NEW VENTURES TO CREATE PRODUCTS THAT DO OR COULD COMPETE WITH CISCOS

PRODUCTS ARE REGULARLY FORMED. IN ADDITION, SEVERAL OF CISCOS CURRENT AND

POTENTIAL COMPETITORS MAY HAVE GREATER RESOURCES, INCLUDING TECHNICAL AND

ENGINEERING RESOURCES, THAN IT DOES.

THE PRINCIPAL COMPETITIVE FACTORS IN THE MARKETS IN WHICH WE PRESENTLY COMPETE

AND MAY COMPETE IN THE FUTURE INCLUDE.



THE ABILITY TO PROVIDE A BROAD RANGE OF NETWORKING PRODUCTS AND SERVICES;



PRODUCT PERFORMANCE;



PRICE;



THE ABILITY TO PROVIDE NEW PRODUCTS;



THE ABILITY TO PROVIDE VALUE-ADDED FEATURES SUCH AS SECURITY,

RELIABILITY, AND INVESTMENT PROTECTION;



CONFORMANCE TO STANDARDS;



MARKET PRESENCE; AND



THE ABILITY TO PROVIDE

FINANCING.

CISCO ALSO FACES COMPETITION FROM CUSTOMERS TO WHOM IT LICENSES OR SUPPLIES

TECHNOLOGY AND SUPPLIERS FROM WHOM IT TRANSFERS TECHNOLOGY. THE INHERENT

NATURE OF NETWORKING REQUIRES INTEROPERABILITY. AS SUCH, WE MUST COOPERATE AND

AT THE SAME TIME COMPETE WITH MANY

9

COMPANIES. ANY INABILITY OF CISCO TO EFFECTIVELY MANAGE THESE COMPLICATED

RELATIONSHIPS WITH CUSTOMERS AND SUPPLIERS, OR THE UNCONTROLLABLE AND

UNPREDICTABLE ACTS OF OTHERS, COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON ITS

BUSINESS, OPERATING RESULTS, AND FINANCIAL CONDITION AND ACCORDINGLY AFFECT ITS

CHANCES OF SUCCESS.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

CISCO REGULARLY SEEKS TO INTRODUCE NEW PRODUCTS AND FEATURES IN AREAS

INCLUDING, AMONG OTHERS, DATA, VOICE, AND VIDEO OVER IP; ADVANCED ACCESS AND

AGGREGATION TECHNOLOGIES SUCH AS CABLE, WIRELESS AND OTHER BROADBAND

TECHNOLOGIES; ADVANCED ENTERPRISE SWITCHING; OPTICAL TRANSPORT; STORAGE

NETWORKING; CONTENT NETWORKING; SECURITY; NETWORK MANAGEMENT; AND ADVANCED CORE

AND EDGE ROUTING TECHNOLOGIES.

THE INDUSTRY IN WHICH CISCO COMPETES IS SUBJECT TO RAPID TECHNOLOGICAL

DEVELOPMENTS, EVOLVING INDUSTRY STANDARDS, CHANGES IN CUSTOMER REQUIREMENTS,

AND NEW PRODUCT INTRODUCTIONS AND ENHANCEMENTS. AS A RESULT, CISCOS SUCCESS,

IN PART, DEPENDS UPON ITS ABILITY, ON A COST-EFFECTIVE AND TIMELY BASIS, TO

CONTINUE TO ENHANCE ITS EXISTING PRODUCTS AND TO DEVELOP AND INTRODUCE NEW

PRODUCTS THAT IMPROVE PERFORMANCE AND REDUCE TOTAL COST OF OWNERSHIP. IN ORDER

TO ACHIEVE THESE OBJECTIVES, CISCOS MANAGEMENT AND ENGINEERING PERSONNEL WORK

WITH CUSTOMERS TO IDENTIFY AND RESPOND TO CUSTOMER NEEDS, AS WELL AS WITH OTHER

INNOVATORS OF INTERNETWORKING PRODUCTS, INCLUDING UNIVERSITIES, LABORATORIES,

AND CORPORATIONS. CISCO ALSO EXPECTS TO CONTINUE TO MAKE ACQUISITIONS AND

INVESTMENTS WHERE APPROPRIATE. CISCO INTENDS TO WORK TO ACHIEVE PRODUCTS THAT

MEET KEY INDUSTRY STANDARDS AND TO CONTINUE TO SUPPORT IMPORTANT PROTOCOL

STANDARDS AS THEY EMERGE. STILL, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT CISCO WILL BE

ABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY DEVELOP PRODUCTS TO ADDRESS NEW CUSTOMER REQUIREMENTS AND

TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGES, OR THAT SUCH PRODUCTS WILL ACHIEVE MARKET ACCEPTANCE.

CISCOS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENDITURES WERE $3.4 BILLION, $3.9 BILLION,

AND $2.7 BILLION IN FISCAL 2002, 2001, AND 2000, RESPECTIVELY. ALL OF CISCOS

EXPENDITURES FOR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS, AS WELL AS IN-PROCESS RESEARCH

AND DEVELOPMENT OF $65 MILLION, $855 MILLION, AND $1.4 BILLION IN FISCAL 2002,

2001, AND 2000, RESPECTIVELY, HAVE BEEN EXPENSED AS INCURRED.

MANUFACTURING

CISCO PRIMARILY EMPLOYS AN OUTSOURCED MANUFACTURING STRATEGY THAT RELIES ON

CONTRACT MANUFACTURERS FOR MANUFACTURING SERVICES. CISCOS MANUFACTURING

OPERATIONS PRIMARILY CONSIST OF QUALITY ASSURANCE OF MATERIALS AND COMPONENTS,

SUBASSEMBLIES, FINAL ASSEMBLY AND TEST OF PRODUCTS. WE PRESENTLY USE A VARIETY

OF INDEPENDENT THIRD-PARTY COMPANIES TO PROVIDE SERVICES RELATED TO PRINTED

CIRCUIT BOARD ASSEMBLY, IN-CIRCUIT TEST, AND PRODUCT REPAIR AS WELL AS PRODUCT

ASSEMBLY. CISCO AND ITS SUPPLIERS INSTALL PROPRIETARY SOFTWARE ON

ELECTRONICALLY PROGRAMMABLE MEMORY CHIPS INSTALLED IN ITS SYSTEMS IN ORDER TO

CONFIGURE PRODUCTS TO CUSTOMER NEEDS AND TO MAINTAIN QUALITY CONTROL AND

SECURITY. THE MANUFACTURING PROCESS ENABLES CISCO TO CONFIGURE THE HARDWARE

AND SOFTWARE IN UNIQUE COMBINATIONS TO MEET A WIDE VARIETY OF INDIVIDUAL

CUSTOMER REQUIREMENTS. CISCO ALSO USES AUTOMATED TESTING EQUIPMENT AND

BURN-IN PROCEDURES, AS WELL AS COMPREHENSIVE INSPECTION, TESTING, AND

STATISTICAL PROCESS CONTROL, TO ENSURE THE QUALITY AND RELIABILITY OF ITS

PRODUCTS. CISCO AND ITS PARTNERS MANUFACTURING PROCESSES AND PROCEDURES ARE

10

GENERALLY ISO 9001 OR ISO 9003 CERTIFIED.

PATENTS, INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, AND LICENSING

CISCO SEEKS TO ESTABLISH AND MAINTAIN ITS PROPRIETARY RIGHTS IN ITS TECHNOLOGY

AND PRODUCTS THROUGH THE USE OF PATENTS, COPYRIGHTS, TRADEMARKS, AND TRADE

SECRET LAWS. CISCO HAS A PROGRAM TO FILE APPLICATIONS FOR AND OBTAIN PATENTS,

COPYRIGHTS, AND TRADEMARKS IN THE UNITED STATES AND IN SELECTED FOREIGN

COUNTRIES WHERE IT BELIEVES FILING FOR SUCH PROTECTION IS APPROPRIATE. CISCO

ALSO SEEKS TO MAINTAIN ITS TRADE SECRETS AND CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION BY

NON-DISCLOSURE POLICIES AND THROUGH THE USE OF APPROPRIATE CONFIDENTIALITY

AGREEMENTS. CISCO HAS OBTAINED A SUBSTANTIAL NUMBER OF PATENTS IN THE UNITED

STATES AND IN OTHER COUNTRIES. THE EXISTENCE OF PATENTS DOES NOT MEAN,

HOWEVER, THAT THESE PATENTS ARE VALID OR CAN BE ENFORCED AGAINST COMPETITIVE

PRODUCTS IN EVERY JURISDICTION. ALTHOUGH CISCO BELIEVES THE PROTECTION AFFORDED

BY ITS PATENTS, PATENT APPLICATIONS, COPYRIGHTS, TRADEMARKS AND TRADE SECRETS

HAS VALUE, THE RAPIDLY CHANGING TECHNOLOGY IN THE NETWORKING INDUSTRY AND

UNCERTAINTIES IN THE LEGAL PROCESS MAKES CISCOS FUTURE SUCCESS DEPENDENT

PRIMARILY ON THE INNOVATIVE SKILLS, TECHNOLOGICAL EXPERTISE, AND MANAGEMENT

ABILITIES OF ITS EMPLOYEES RATHER THAN ON THE PROTECTION AFFORDED BY PATENT,

COPYRIGHT, TRADEMARK, AND TRADE SECRET LAWS.

MANY CISCO PRODUCTS ARE DESIGNED TO INCLUDE SOFTWARE OR OTHER INTELLECTUAL

PROPERTY LICENSED FROM THIRD PARTIES. WHILE IT MAY BE NECESSARY IN THE FUTURE

TO SEEK OR RENEW LICENSES RELATING TO VARIOUS ASPECTS OF ITS PRODUCTS, CISCO

BELIEVES, BASED UPON PAST EXPERIENCE AND STANDARD INDUSTRY PRACTICE THAT SUCH

LICENSES GENERALLY COULD BE OBTAINED ON COMMERCIALLY REASONABLE TERMS.

NONETHELESS, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THE NECESSARY LICENSES WOULD BE

AVAILABLE ON ACCEPTABLE TERMS, IF AT ALL. THE INABILITY OF CISCO TO OBTAIN

CERTAIN LICENSES OR OTHER RIGHTS OR TO OBTAIN SUCH LICENSES OR RIGHTS ON

FAVORABLE TERMS, OR THE NEED TO ENGAGE IN LITIGATION REGARDING THESE MATTERS,

COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON ITS BUSINESS, OPERATING RESULTS, AND

FINANCIAL CONDITION. MOREOVER, INCLUSION IN CISCOS PRODUCTS OF SOFTWARE OR

OTHER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY LICENSED FROM THIRD PARTIES ON A NON-EXCLUSIVE

BASIS CAN LIMIT CISCOS ABILITY TO PROTECT ITS PROPRIETARY RIGHTS IN ITS

PRODUCTS.

THE INDUSTRY IN WHICH CISCO COMPETES IS CHARACTERIZED BY RAPIDLY CHANGING

TECHNOLOGY, A LARGE NUMBER OF PATENTS, AND FREQUENT CLAIMS AND RELATED

LITIGATION REGARDING PATENT AND OTHER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS. THERE CAN

BE NO ASSURANCE THAT CISCOS PATENTS AND OTHER PROPRIETARY RIGHTS WILL NOT BE

CHALLENGED, INVALIDATED OR CIRCUMVENTED, THAT OTHERS WILL NOT ASSERT

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS TO TECHNOLOGIES THAT ARE RELEVANT TO CISCO, OR

THAT ITS RIGHTS WILL GIVE CISCO A COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE IN WHICH IT COMPETES.

IN ADDITION, THE LAWS OF SOME FOREIGN COUNTRIES MAY NOT PROTECT CISCOS

PROPRIETARY RIGHTS TO THE SAME EXTENT AS THE LAWS OF THE UNITED STATES. THE

RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH PATENTS AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY ARE MORE FULLY

DISCUSSED IN THE RISK FACTORS 

OUR BUSINESS DEPENDS UPON

OUR PROPRIETARY RIGHTS, WHICH MIGHT PROVE DIFFICULT TO ENFORCE, AND

THERE IS A RISK OUR PRODUCTS COULD BE HELD TO INFRINGE RIGHTS OF

THIRD PARTIES

 SECTION

CONTAINED IN ITEM 1 OF THIS REPORT.

EMPLOYEES

AS OF JULY 27, 2002, CISCO HAS APPROXIMATELY 36,000 EMPLOYEES, INCLUDING 6,000

IN MANUFACTURING AND SERVICE; 13,000 IN ENGINEERING; 14,000 IN SALES AND

MARKETING; AND 3,000 IN FINANCE AND ADMINISTRATION. APPROXIMATELY 10,000

EMPLOYEES ARE IN LOCATIONS OUTSIDE THE UNITED

11

STATES. CISCO CONSIDERS THE RELATIONSHIPS WITH ITS EMPLOYEES TO BE POSITIVE.

COMPETITION FOR TECHNICAL PERSONNEL IN THE INDUSTRY IN WHICH CISCO COMPETES IS

INTENSE. CISCO BELIEVES THAT ITS FUTURE SUCCESS DEPENDS IN PART ON ITS

CONTINUED ABILITY TO HIRE, ASSIMILATE, AND RETAIN QUALIFIED PERSONNEL. TO

DATE, CISCO BELIEVES THAT IT HAS BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN RECRUITING QUALIFIED

EMPLOYEES, BUT THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT IT WILL CONTINUE TO BE SUCCESSFUL IN

THE FUTURE.

12

RISK FACTORS

SET FORTH BELOW AND ELSEWHERE IN THIS REPORT AND IN OTHER DOCUMENTS WE FILE

WITH THE SEC ARE RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES THAT COULD CAUSE ACTUAL RESULTS TO

DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THE RESULTS CONTEMPLATED BY THE FORWARD-LOOKING

STATEMENTS CONTAINED IN THE REPORT.

OUR OPERATING RESULTS MAY FLUCTUATE IN FUTURE PERIODS

OUR OPERATING RESULTS HAVE BEEN IN THE PAST, AND WILL CONTINUE TO BE, SUBJECT

TO QUARTERLY AND ANNUAL FLUCTUATIONS AS A RESULT OF A NUMBER OF FACTORS. THESE

FACTORS INCLUDE.



FLUCTUATIONS IN DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, SUCH AS HAS OCCURRED IN THE LAST TWO FISCAL YEARS, ESPECIALLY WITH

RESPECT TO INTERNET BUSINESSES AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICE PROVIDERS;



CHANGES IN SALES AND IMPLEMENTATION CYCLES FOR OUR PRODUCTS AND THE REDUCED VISIBILITY INTO OUR CUSTOMERS SPENDING PLANS AND

ASSOCIATED REVENUE;



OUR ABILITY TO MAINTAIN APPROPRIATE INVENTORY LEVELS AND PURCHASE COMMITMENTS;



PRICE AND PRODUCT COMPETITION IN THE COMMUNICATIONS AND NETWORKING INDUSTRIES WHICH CAN CHANGE RAPIDLY DUE TO TECHNOLOGICAL

INNOVATION;



THE OVERALL TREND TOWARD INDUSTRY CONSOLIDATION BOTH AMONG OUR COMPETITORS AND OUR CUSTOMERS;



THE INTRODUCTION AND MARKET ACCEPTANCE OF NEW TECHNOLOGIES AND PRODUCTS, AS WELL AS THE ADOPTION OF NEW NETWORKING STANDARDS;



VARIATIONS IN SALES CHANNELS, PRODUCT COSTS, OR MIX OF PRODUCTS SOLD;



THE TIMING AND SIZE OF ORDERS FROM CUSTOMERS;



MANUFACTURING LEAD TIMES;



FLUCTUATIONS IN OUR GROSS MARGINS;



OUR ABILITY TO ACHIEVE TARGETED COST REDUCTIONS;



THE ABILITY OF OUR CUSTOMERS AND SUPPLIERS TO OBTAIN FINANCING OR TO FUND CAPITAL EXPENDITURES;



THE TIMING AND AMOUNT OF EMPLOYER PAYROLL TAX TO BE PAID ON EMPLOYEES GAINS ON STOCK OPTIONS EXERCISED;



ACTUAL EVENTS, CIRCUMSTANCES, OUTCOMES, AND AMOUNTS DIFFERING FROM JUDGMENTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND ESTIMATES USED IN DETERMINING

THE VALUES OF CERTAIN ASSETS (INCLUDING THE AMOUNTS OF RELATED VALUATION ALLOWANCES), LIABILITIES AND OTHER ITEMS REFLECTED IN

OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS; AND



CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING RULES, SUCH AS RECORDING EXPENSES FOR EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTION GRANTS.

AS A CONSEQUENCE, OPERATING RESULTS FOR A PARTICULAR FUTURE PERIOD ARE

DIFFICULT TO PREDICT, AND THEREFORE, PRIOR RESULTS ARE NOT NECESSARILY

INDICATIVE OF RESULTS TO BE EXPECTED IN FUTURE PERIODS. ANY OF THE FOREGOING

FACTORS, OR ANY OTHER FACTORS DISCUSSED ELSEWHERE HEREIN, COULD HAVE A MATERIAL

ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

13

OUR BUSINESS MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY UNFAVORABLE ECONOMIC AND MARKET

CONDITIONS

ADVERSE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS WORLDWIDE HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO SLOWDOWNS IN THE

COMMUNICATIONS AND NETWORKING INDUSTRIES AND MAY CONTINUE TO IMPACT OUR

BUSINESS, RESULTING IN.



REDUCED DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS AS A RESULT OF A DECREASE IN CAPITAL

SPENDING BY OUR CUSTOMERS, PARTICULARLY SERVICE PROVIDERS;



INCREASED PRICE COMPETITION FOR OUR PRODUCTS, PARTIALLY AS A CONSEQUENCE

OF CUSTOMERS DISPOSING OF UNUTILIZED PRODUCTS;



INCREASED RISK OF EXCESS AND OBSOLETE INVENTORIES;



EXCESS FACILITIES AND MANUFACTURING CAPACITY; AND



HIGHER OVERHEAD COSTS AS A PERCENTAGE OF REVENUES.

RECENT POLITICAL TURMOIL IN MANY PARTS OF THE WORLD, INCLUDING TERRORIST AND

MILITARY ACTIONS, MAY CONTINUE TO PUT PRESSURE ON GLOBAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS.

IF THE ECONOMIC AND MARKET CONDITIONS IN THE UNITED STATES AND GLOBALLY DO NOT

IMPROVE, OR IF THEY DETERIORATE FURTHER, WE MAY CONTINUE TO EXPERIENCE MATERIAL

ADVERSE IMPACTS ON OUR BUSINESS, OPERATING RESULTS, AND FINANCIAL CONDITION AS

A CONSEQUENCE OF THE ABOVE FACTORS OR OTHERWISE. WE DO NOT EXPECT THE TREND OF

LOWER CAPITAL SPENDING AMONG SERVICE PROVIDERS TO REVERSE ITSELF IN THE NEAR

TERM.

OUR DIFFICULTY IN PREDICTING REVENUES MAY HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR

OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL RESULTS

AS A RESULT OF A VARIETY OF FACTORS DISCUSSED IN THIS REPORT, OUR REVENUES FOR

A PARTICULAR QUARTER ARE DIFFICULT TO PREDICT. OUR NET SALES MAY GROW AT A

SLOWER RATE THAN EXPERIENCED IN PAST PERIODS AND, IN PARTICULAR PERIODS, MAY

DECLINE. OUR ABILITY TO MEET FINANCIAL EXPECTATIONS COULD ALSO BE ADVERSELY

AFFECTED IF THE NONLINEAR SALES PATTERN SEEN IN CERTAIN OF OUR PAST QUARTERS

RECURS IN FUTURE PERIODS. WE HAVE EXPERIENCED PERIODS OF TIME WHERE SHIPMENTS

EXCEEDED NET BOOKINGS, LEADING TO NONLINEARITY IN SHIPPING PATTERNS. THIS CAN

INCREASE COSTS, AS IRREGULAR SHIPMENT PATTERNS RESULT IN PERIODS OF

UNDERUTILIZED CAPACITY AND PERIODS WHEN OVERTIME EXPENSES MAY BE INCURRED, AS

WELL AS LEADING TO ADDITIONAL COSTS ARISING OUT OF INVENTORY MANAGEMENT.

IN ADDITION, TO IMPROVE CUSTOMER SATISFACTION, WE CONTINUE TO ATTEMPT TO REDUCE

OUR MANUFACTURING LEAD TIMES, WHICH MAY RESULT IN CORRESPONDING REDUCTIONS IN

ORDER BACKLOG. A DECLINE IN BACKLOG LEVELS COULD RESULT IN MORE VARIABILITY

AND LESS PREDICTABILITY IN OUR QUARTER-TO-QUARTER NET SALES AND OPERATING

RESULTS GOING FORWARD. IN THE PAST, LONG MANUFACTURING LEAD TIMES CAUSED OUR

CUSTOMERS TO PLACE THE SAME ORDER MULTIPLE TIMES WITHIN OUR VARIOUS SALES

CHANNELS AND CANCEL THE DUPLICATIVE ORDERS WHEN THE PRODUCT IS RECEIVED FROM

ONE OF THE CHANNELS FROM WHERE IT WAS ORDERED, OR PLACE ORDERS WITH OTHER

VENDORS WITH SHORTER MANUFACTURING LEAD TIMES. SUCH MULTIPLE ORDERING (ALONG

WITH OTHER FACTORS) MAY CAUSE DIFFICULTY IN PREDICTING OUR SALES, AND AS A

RESULT COULD IMPAIR OUR ABILITY TO MANAGE PARTS INVENTORY EFFECTIVELY.

14

WE PLAN OUR OPERATING EXPENSE LEVELS PRIMARILY BASED ON FORECASTED REVENUE

LEVELS. THESE EXPENSES AND THE IMPACT OF LONG-TERM COMMITMENTS ARE RELATIVELY

FIXED IN THE SHORT-TERM. A SHORTFALL IN REVENUE COULD LEAD TO OPERATING

RESULTS BEING BELOW EXPECTATIONS AS WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO QUICKLY REDUCE THESE

FIXED EXPENSES IN RESPONSE TO SHORT-TERM BUSINESS CHANGES.

ANY OF THE ABOVE FACTORS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR OPERATIONS

AND FINANCIAL RESULTS.

WE EXPECT GROSS MARGIN VARIABILITY OVER TIME

ALTHOUGH WE HAVE EXPERIENCED INCREASING PRODUCT GROSS MARGINS DURING FISCAL

2002, PRODUCT GROSS MARGINS MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED IN THE FUTURE BY A NUMBER

OF FACTORS, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO.



CHANGES IN CUSTOMER, GEOGRAPHIC OR PRODUCT MIX, INCLUDING MIX OF

CONFIGURATIONS WITHIN EACH PRODUCT GROUP;



INCREASES IN MATERIAL OR LABOR COSTS;



EXCESS INVENTORY;



OBSOLESCENCE CHARGES;



CHANGES IN SHIPMENT VOLUME;



LOSS OF COST SAVINGS DUE TO CHANGES IN COMPONENT PRICING OR CHARGES

INCURRED DUE TO INVENTORY HOLDING PERIODS IF PARTS ORDERING DOES NOT

CORRECTLY ANTICIPATE PRODUCT DEMAND;



INCREASED PRICE COMPETITION;



CHANGES IN DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS;



INCREASED WARRANTY COSTS; AND



INTRODUCTION OF NEW PRODUCTS AND COSTS OF ENTERING NEW MARKETS.

CHANGES IN SERVICE GROSS MARGIN MAY RESULT FROM VARIOUS FACTORS SUCH AS THE

CHANGES IN MIX BETWEEN TECHNICAL SUPPORT AND CONSULTATIVE SERVICES, AS WELL AS

THE TIMING OF SUPPORT CONTRACT RENEWALS.

DISRUPTION OF OR CHANGES IN THE MIX OF OUR PRODUCT DISTRIBUTION MODEL OR

CUSTOMER BASE COULD AFFECT SALES AND MARGINS

IF WE FAIL TO MANAGE DISTRIBUTION OF OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES PROPERLY, OR IF

OUR DISTRIBUTORS FINANCIAL CONDITION OR OPERATIONS WEAKEN, OUR REVENUES AND

GROSS MARGINS COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED. FURTHERMORE, A CHANGE IN THE MIX OF

OUR CUSTOMERS BETWEEN SERVICE PROVIDER AND ENTERPRISE, OR A CHANGE IN MIX OF

DIRECT SALES AND INDIRECT SALES, CAN ADVERSELY AFFECT REVENUES AND GROSS

MARGINS.

WE USE A VARIETY OF CHANNELS TO BRING OUR PRODUCTS TO OUR CUSTOMERS, INCLUDING

SYSTEM INTEGRATORS, TWO-TIER DISTRIBUTORS WHO IN TURN SELL TO RESELLERS, AND

DIRECT SALES TO BOTH ENTERPRISE ACCOUNTS AND SERVICE PROVIDERS. SINCE EACH

DISTRIBUTION CHANNEL HAS A DISTINCT PROFILE, THE FAILURE

15

TO IMPLEMENT THE MOST ADVANTAGEOUS BALANCE IN THE DELIVERY MODEL FOR OUR

PRODUCTS AND SERVICES COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR GROSS MARGIN AND, THEREFORE,

PROFITABILITY.

FOR EXAMPLE.



AS WE RESPOND TO DEMAND FROM CERTAIN CATEGORIES OF CUSTOMERS TO SELL

DIRECTLY TO THEM, WE COULD RISK ALIENATING CHANNEL PARTNERS AND ADVERSELY

AFFECTING OUR DISTRIBUTION MODEL.



BECAUSE DIRECT SALES MAY COMPETE WITH THE SALES MADE BY CHANNEL PARTNERS,

THESE CHANNEL PARTNERS MAY ELECT TO USE OTHER SUPPLIERS THAT DO NOT

DIRECTLY SELL THEIR OWN PRODUCTS.



SOME OF OUR SYSTEM INTEGRATORS MAY DEMAND THAT WE ABSORB A GREATER SHARE

OF THE RISKS THAT THEIR CUSTOMERS MAY ASK THEM TO BEAR, AFFECTING OUR

GROSS MARGIN.



SOME OF OUR CHANNEL PARTNERS MAY HAVE INSUFFICIENT FINANCIAL RESOURCES

AND MAY NOT BE ABLE TO WITHSTAND CHANGES IN BUSINESS CONDITIONS,

INCLUDING THE RECENT ECONOMIC DOWNTURN. REVENUES FROM INDIRECT SALES

COULD SUFFER IF OUR DISTRIBUTORS FINANCIAL CONDITION OR OPERATIONS

WEAKEN.



SERVICE PROVIDER CUSTOMERS MAY DEMAND RIGOROUS ACCEPTANCE TESTING OR

PRIME CONTRACTING. AS WE DEVELOP MORE SOLUTION ORIENTED PRODUCTS,

ENTERPRISE CUSTOMERS MAY DEMAND SIMILAR TERMS AND CONDITIONS. SUCH TERMS

AND CONDITIONS CAN LOWER GROSS MARGIN AND DEFER REVENUE RECOGNITION.

WE MUST MANAGE INVENTORY EFFECTIVELY, PARTICULARLY WITH RESPECT TO SALES TO

DISTRIBUTORS. DISTRIBUTORS MAY INCREASE ORDERS DURING PERIODS OF PRODUCT

SHORTAGES, CANCEL ORDERS IF THEIR INVENTORY IS TOO HIGH, OR DELAY ORDERS IN

ANTICIPATION OF NEW PRODUCTS. DISTRIBUTORS ALSO MAY ADJUST THEIR ORDERS IN

RESPONSE TO THE SUPPLY OF OUR PRODUCTS AND THE PRODUCTS OF OUR COMPETITORS THAT

ARE AVAILABLE TO THE DISTRIBUTOR AND TO SEASONAL FLUCTUATIONS IN END-USER

DEMAND. IF WE HAVE EXCESS INVENTORY, WE MAY HAVE TO REDUCE OUR PRICES AND WRITE

DOWN INVENTORY, WHICH IN TURN COULD RESULT IN LOWER GROSS MARGINS. OUR

TWO-TIER DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS, IN CONTRAST TO OUR ONE-TIER DISTRIBUTORS, ARE

GIVEN PRIVILEGES TO RETURN A PORTION OF INVENTORY AND PARTICIPATE IN VARIOUS

COOPERATIVE MARKETING PROGRAMS. IN ADDITION, IF SALES THROUGH INDIRECT

CHANNELS INCREASE, THIS MAY LEAD TO GREATER DIFFICULTY IN FORECASTING THE MIX

OF OUR PRODUCTS, AND TO A CERTAIN DEGREE, THE TIMING OF ORDERS FROM OUR

CUSTOMERS. WE RECOGNIZE REVENUE TO TWO-TIER DISTRIBUTORS BASED ON INFORMATION

PROVIDED BY OUR DISTRIBUTORS AND ALSO MAINTAIN ACCRUALS AND ALLOWANCES FOR ALL

COOPERATIVE MARKETING AND OTHER PROGRAMS.

SALES TO THE SERVICE PROVIDER MARKET ARE ESPECIALLY VOLATILE

SALES TO THE SERVICE PROVIDER MARKET HAVE BEEN CHARACTERIZED BY LARGE AND OFTEN

SPORADIC PURCHASES WITH LONGER SALES CYCLES. WE HAVE EXPERIENCED SIGNIFICANT

DECREASES IN SALES TO SERVICE PROVIDERS AS MARKET CONDITIONS HAVE

CHANGED. SALES ACTIVITY IN THIS INDUSTRY DEPENDS UPON THE STAGE OF COMPLETION

OF EXPANDING NETWORK INFRASTRUCTURES, THE AVAILABILITY OF FUNDING, AND THE

EXTENT THAT SERVICE PROVIDERS ARE AFFECTED BY REGULATORY, ECONOMIC, AND

BUSINESS CONDITIONS IN THE COUNTRY OF OPERATIONS. CONTINUED DECLINES OR DELAYS

IN SALES ORDERS FROM THIS INDUSTRY COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR

BUSINESS, OPERATING RESULTS, AND FINANCIAL CONDITION, PARTICULARLY AS WE

CONTINUE TO INVEST IN DEVELOPMENT OF NEW PRODUCTS AIMED AT THIS MARKET SEGMENT.

THE SLOWDOWN IN THE GENERAL ECONOMY, OVER-CAPACITY, CHANGES IN THE SERVICE

16

PROVIDER MARKET, AND THE CONSTRAINTS ON CAPITAL AVAILABILITY HAVE HAD A

MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON MANY OF OUR SERVICE PROVIDER CUSTOMERS, WITH A

NUMBER OF SUCH CUSTOMERS GOING OUT OF BUSINESS OR SUBSTANTIALLY REDUCING THEIR

EXPANSION PLANS. THESE CONDITIONS HAVE HAD A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR

BUSINESS AND OPERATING RESULTS, AND WE EXPECT THAT THESE CONDITIONS MAY

CONTINUE FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. FINALLY, SERVICE PROVIDER CUSTOMERS

TYPICALLY HAVE LONGER DESIGN CYCLES, REQUIRE A BROADER RANGE OF SERVICE,

INCLUDING DESIGN SERVICES, DEMAND THAT VENDORS TAKE ON A LARGER SHARE OF RISKS,

OFTEN HAVE ACCEPTANCE PROVISIONS WHICH CAN LEAD TO A DELAY IN REVENUE

RECOGNITION AND EXPECT FINANCING FROM VENDORS. ALL THESE FACTORS CAN ADD

FURTHER RISK TO BUSINESS CONDUCTED WITH SERVICE PROVIDERS.

WE ARE DEPENDENT UPON ADEQUATE COMPONENT SUPPLY AND MANUFACTURING CAPACITY

OUR GROWTH AND ABILITY TO MEET CUSTOMER DEMANDS ALSO DEPEND IN PART ON OUR

ABILITY TO OBTAIN TIMELY DELIVERIES OF PARTS FROM OUR SUPPLIERS. WE HAVE

EXPERIENCED COMPONENT SHORTAGES IN THE PAST THAT HAVE ADVERSELY AFFECTED OUR

OPERATIONS. WE MAY IN THE FUTURE EXPERIENCE A SHORT SUPPLY OF CERTAIN COMPONENT

PARTS AS A RESULT OF STRONG DEMAND IN THE INDUSTRY FOR THOSE PARTS OR PROBLEMS

EXPERIENCED BY SUPPLIERS. IF SHORTAGES OR DELAYS PERSIST, THE PRICE OF THESE

COMPONENTS MAY INCREASE, OR THE COMPONENTS MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE AT ALL. WE MAY

NOT BE ABLE TO SECURE ENOUGH COMPONENTS AT REASONABLE PRICES OR OF ACCEPTABLE

QUALITY TO BUILD NEW PRODUCTS IN A TIMELY MANNER IN THE QUANTITIES OR

CONFIGURATIONS NEEDED. ACCORDINGLY, OUR REVENUES AND GROSS MARGINS COULD SUFFER

UNTIL OTHER SOURCES CAN BE DEVELOPED. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL

NOT ENCOUNTER THESE PROBLEMS IN THE FUTURE. ALTHOUGH IN MANY CASES WE USE

STANDARD PARTS AND COMPONENTS FOR OUR PRODUCTS, CERTAIN COMPONENTS ARE

PRESENTLY AVAILABLE ONLY FROM A SINGLE SOURCE OR LIMITED SOURCES. WE MAY NOT

BE ABLE TO DIVERSIFY SOURCES IN A TIMELY MANNER, WHICH COULD HARM OUR ABILITY

TO DELIVER PRODUCTS TO CUSTOMERS AND SERIOUSLY IMPACT PRESENT AND FUTURE SALES.

WE BELIEVE THAT WE MAY BE FACED WITH THE FOLLOWING CHALLENGES GOING FORWARD.



NEW MARKETS THAT WE PARTICIPATE IN MAY GROW QUICKLY AND THUS, CONSUME

SIGNIFICANT COMPONENT CAPACITY;



AS WE CONTINUE TO ACQUIRE COMPANIES AND NEW TECHNOLOGIES, WE ARE

DEPENDENT, AT LEAST INITIALLY, ON UNFAMILIAR SUPPLY CHAINS OR RELATIVELY

SMALL SUPPLY PARTNERS; AND



WE FACE COMPETITION FOR CERTAIN COMPONENTS, WHICH ARE SUPPLY CONSTRAINED,

FROM EXISTING COMPETITORS AND COMPANIES IN OTHER MARKETS.

MANUFACTURING CAPACITY AND COMPONENT SUPPLY CONSTRAINTS COULD BE SIGNIFICANT

ISSUES FOR US. WE USE SEVERAL CONTRACT MANUFACTURERS AND SUPPLIERS TO PROVIDE

MANUFACTURING SERVICES FOR OUR PRODUCTS. DURING THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS,

IN ORDER TO REDUCE MANUFACTURING LEAD TIMES AND ENSURE ADEQUATE COMPONENT

SUPPLY, WE ENTER INTO AGREEMENTS WITH CERTAIN CONTRACT MANUFACTURERS AND

SUPPLIERS THAT ALLOW THEM TO PROCURE INVENTORY BASED UPON CRITERIA AS DEFINED

BY US. IF WE FAIL TO ANTICIPATE CUSTOMER DEMAND PROPERLY, AN OVERSUPPLY OF

PARTS COULD RESULT IN EXCESS OR OBSOLETE COMPONENTS WHICH COULD ADVERSELY

AFFECT OUR GROSS MARGINS. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING OUR PURCHASE

COMMITMENTS, SEE NOTE 8, COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES, ON PAGES

17

38 TO 40 OF OUR 2002 ANNUAL REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS, WHICH IS INCORPORATED BY

REFERENCE HEREIN. A REDUCTION OR INTERRUPTION IN SUPPLY, A SIGNIFICANT

INCREASE IN THE PRICE OF ONE OR MORE COMPONENTS, A FAILURE TO ADEQUATELY

AUTHORIZE PROCUREMENT OF INVENTORY BY OUR CONTRACT MANUFACTURERS, OR A DECREASE

IN DEMAND OF PRODUCTS COULD MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, OPERATING

RESULTS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION AND COULD MATERIALLY DAMAGE CUSTOMER

RELATIONSHIPS. FURTHERMORE, AS A RESULT OF BINDING PRICE OR PURCHASE

COMMITMENTS WITH SUPPLIERS, WE MAY BE OBLIGATED TO PURCHASE COMPONENTS AT

PRICES THAT ARE HIGHER THAN THOSE AVAILABLE IN THE CURRENT MARKET. IN THE EVENT

THAT WE BECOME COMMITTED TO PURCHASE COMPONENTS AT PRICES IN EXCESS OF THE

CURRENT MARKET PRICE WHEN THE COMPONENTS ARE ACTUALLY UTILIZED, OUR GROSS

MARGINS COULD DECREASE.

THE FACT THAT WE DO NOT OWN THE BULK OF OUR MANUFACTURING FACILITIES COULD HAVE

AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON FUTURE PRODUCTS SUPPLY AND ON OPERATING RESULTS.

FINANCIAL PROBLEMS OF CONTRACT MANUFACTURERS ON WHOM WE RELY, OR RESERVATION OF

CAPACITY BY OTHER COMPANIES, INSIDE OR OUTSIDE OF OUR INDUSTRY, COULD EITHER

LIMIT SUPPLY OR INCREASE COSTS.

WE HAVE MANY SUBSTANTIAL COMPETITORS

FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING OUR COMPETITION, AND THE RISKS ARISING OUT

OF THE COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH WE OPERATE, SEE THE SECTION ENTITLED

COMPETITION CONTAINED IN ITEM 1 OF THIS REPORT.

WE DEPEND UPON THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW PRODUCTS AND ENHANCEMENTS TO EXISTING

PRODUCTS AND ARE SUBJECT TO RAPID CHANGES IN TECHNOLOGY AND THE MARKET

THE MARKETS FOR OUR PRODUCTS ARE CHARACTERIZED BY RAPIDLY CHANGING TECHNOLOGY,

EVOLVING INDUSTRY STANDARDS, NEW PRODUCT INTRODUCTIONS, AND EVOLVING METHODS OF

BUILDING AND OPERATING NETWORKS. OUR OPERATING RESULTS DEPEND ON OUR ABILITY

TO DEVELOP AND INTRODUCE NEW PRODUCTS INTO EXISTING AND EMERGING MARKETS AND TO

REDUCE THE COSTS TO PRODUCE EXISTING PRODUCTS. AS WE HAVE INDICATED IN PART 1

OF THIS REPORT, WE BELIEVE THE INTERNET AND OTHER DATA, VOICE AND VIDEO

NETWORKS ARE EVOLVING INTO A NETWORK OF NETWORKS WHICH WILL REQUIRE COMMON

TECHNOLOGY PLATFORMS AND BROAD END-TO-END SOLUTIONS FOR PARTICULAR APPLICATIONS

RATHER THAN PRODUCTS AIMED AT PARTICULAR MARKET SEGMENTS. IN THAT

ENVIRONMENT,

CUSTOMERS WILL BE MORE CONCERNED WITH OVERALL SOLUTIONS RATHER THAN WITH

WHETHER THE SOLUTION IS BUILT AROUND A PARTICULAR TECHNOLOGY, SUCH AS ROUTING

OR SWITCHING. THE PROCESS OF DEVELOPING NEW TECHNOLOGY IS COMPLEX AND

UNCERTAIN, AND IF WE FAIL TO ACCURATELY PREDICT CUSTOMERS CHANGING NEEDS AND

EMERGING TECHNOLOGICAL TRENDS, OUR BUSINESS COULD BE HARMED. WE MUST COMMIT

SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES TO DEVELOP NEW PRODUCTS BEFORE KNOWING WHETHER OUR

INVESTMENTS WILL RESULT IN PRODUCTS THE MARKET WILL ACCEPT. IN PARTICULAR, IF

THE NETWORK OF NETWORKS DOES NOT EMERGE AS WE BELIEVE IT WILL, MANY OF OUR

INVESTMENTS MAY PROVE TO BE WITHOUT VALUE. FURTHERMORE, WE MAY NOT EXECUTE

SUCCESSFULLY ON THAT VISION BECAUSE OF ERRORS IN PRODUCT PLANNING OR TIMING,

TECHNICAL HURDLES WHICH WE FAIL TO OVERCOME IN TIMELY FASHION, OR BECAUSE OF

LACK OF APPROPRIATE RESOURCES. THIS COULD RESULT IN COMPETITORS PROVIDING

THOSE SOLUTIONS BEFORE WE DO, AND LOSS OF MARKET SHARE, REVENUES AND EARNINGS.

THE SUCCESS OF NEW PRODUCTS IS DEPENDENT ON SEVERAL FACTORS, INCLUDING PROPER

NEW PRODUCT DEFINITION, COMPONENT COSTS, TIMELY COMPLETION AND INTRODUCTION OF

THESE PRODUCTS,

18

DIFFERENTIATION OF NEW PRODUCTS FROM THOSE OF OUR COMPETITORS, AND MARKET

ACCEPTANCE OF THESE PRODUCTS. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL

SUCCESSFULLY IDENTIFY NEW PRODUCT OPPORTUNITIES, DEVELOP AND BRING NEW PRODUCTS

TO MARKET IN A TIMELY MANNER, AND ACHIEVE MARKET ACCEPTANCE OF OUR PRODUCTS, OR

THAT PRODUCTS AND TECHNOLOGIES DEVELOPED BY OTHERS WILL NOT RENDER OUR PRODUCTS

OR TECHNOLOGIES OBSOLETE OR NONCOMPETITIVE.

OUR BUSINESS SUBSTANTIALLY DEPENDS UPON THE CONTINUED GROWTH OF THE INTERNET

AND INTERNET-BASED SYSTEMS; CHANGES IN INDUSTRY STRUCTURE COULD LEAD TO PRODUCT

DISCONTINUANCES

A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF OUR BUSINESS AND REVENUE DEPENDS ON GROWTH OF THE

INTERNET AND ON THE DEPLOYMENT OF OUR PRODUCTS BY CUSTOMERS THAT DEPEND ON THE

CONTINUED GROWTH OF THE INTERNET. AS A RESULT OF THE ECONOMIC SLOWDOWN AND THE

REDUCTION IN CAPITAL SPENDING, WHICH HAS PARTICULARLY AFFECTED

TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICE PROVIDERS, SPENDING ON INTERNET INFRASTRUCTURE HAS

DECLINED, WHICH HAS HAD A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS. TO THE

EXTENT THAT THE ECONOMIC SLOWDOWN AND REDUCTION IN CAPITAL SPENDING CONTINUE TO

ADVERSELY AFFECT SPENDING ON INTERNET INFRASTRUCTURE, WE COULD CONTINUE TO

EXPERIENCE MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECTS ON OUR BUSINESS, OPERATING RESULTS, AND

FINANCIAL CONDITION.

BECAUSE OF THE RAPID INTRODUCTION OF NEW PRODUCTS, AND CHANGING CUSTOMER

REQUIREMENTS RELATED TO MATTERS SUCH AS COST-EFFECTIVENESS AND SECURITY, WE

BELIEVE THAT THERE COULD BE CERTAIN PERFORMANCE PROBLEMS WITH INTERNET

COMMUNICATIONS IN THE FUTURE, WHICH COULD RECEIVE A HIGH DEGREE OF PUBLICITY

AND VISIBILITY. AS WE ARE A LARGE SUPPLIER OF NETWORKING PRODUCTS, WE MAY BE

MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER OR NOT THESE PROBLEMS ARE

DUE TO THE PERFORMANCE OF OUR OWN PRODUCTS. SUCH AN EVENT COULD ALSO RESULT IN

A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE MARKET PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK INDEPENDENT

OF DIRECT EFFECTS ON OUR BUSINESS, AND COULD MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR

BUSINESS, OPERATING RESULTS, AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

IN RESPONSE TO CHANGES IN INDUSTRY AND MARKET CONDITIONS, WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO

STRATEGICALLY REALIGN OUR RESOURCES AND CONSIDER RESTRUCTURING, DISPOSING OF,

OR OTHERWISE, EXITING BUSINESSES. ANY DECISION TO LIMIT INVESTMENT IN OR TO

DISPOSE OF OR OTHERWISE, EXIT BUSINESSES MAY RESULT IN THE RECORDING OF SPECIAL

CHARGES, SUCH AS INVENTORY AND TECHNOLOGY RELATED WRITE-OFFS AND WORKFORCE

REDUCTION COSTS, OR CLAIMS FROM THIRD PARTIES WHO WERE RESELLERS OR USERS OF

DISCONTINUED PRODUCTS. ESTIMATES WITH RESPECT TO THE USEFUL LIFE OR ULTIMATE

RECOVERABILITY OF OUR CARRYING BASIS OF ASSETS, INCLUDING PURCHASED INTANGIBLE

ASSETS, COULD CHANGE AS A RESULT OF SUCH ASSESSMENTS AND DECISIONS.

ADDITIONALLY, WE ARE REQUIRED TO PERFORM GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT TESTS ON AN ANNUAL

BASIS AND BETWEEN ANNUAL TESTS IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES. THERE CAN BE NO

ASSURANCE THAT FUTURE GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT TESTS WILL NOT RESULT IN A CHARGE TO

EARNINGS.

19

WE EXPECT TO MAKE FUTURE ACQUISITIONS; ACQUISITIONS INVOLVE NUMEROUS RISKS

OUR GROWTH IS DEPENDENT UPON MARKET GROWTH, OUR ABILITY TO ENHANCE OUR EXISTING

PRODUCTS, AND OUR ABILITY TO INTRODUCE NEW PRODUCTS ON A TIMELY BASIS. WE HAVE

AND WILL CONTINUE TO ADDRESS THE NEED TO DEVELOP NEW PRODUCTS THROUGH

ACQUISITIONS OF OTHER COMPANIES AND TECHNOLOGIES, INCLUDING THE PERSONNEL SUCH

ACQUISITIONS MAY BRING TO US. ACQUISITIONS INVOLVE NUMEROUS RISKS, INCLUDING

THE FOLLOWING.



DIFFICULTIES IN INTEGRATING THE OPERATIONS, TECHNOLOGIES, PRODUCTS AND PERSONNEL OF THE ACQUIRED COMPANIES;



DIVERSION OF MANAGEMENTS ATTENTION FROM NORMAL DAILY OPERATIONS OF THE BUSINESS;



POTENTIAL DIFFICULTIES IN COMPLETING PROJECTS ASSOCIATED WITH IN-PROCESS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT;



DIFFICULTIES IN ENTERING MARKETS IN WHICH WE HAVE NO OR LIMITED DIRECT PRIOR EXPERIENCE AND WHERE COMPETITORS IN

SUCH MARKETS HAVE STRONGER MARKET POSITIONS;



INITIAL DEPENDENCE ON UNFAMILIAR SUPPLY CHAINS OR RELATIVELY SMALL SUPPLY PARTNERS;



INSUFFICIENT REVENUES TO OFFSET INCREASED EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH ACQUISITIONS; AND



THE POTENTIAL LOSS OF KEY EMPLOYEES OF THE ACQUIRED COMPANIES.

ACQUISITIONS MAY ALSO CAUSE US TO.



ISSUE COMMON STOCK THAT WOULD DILUTE OUR CURRENT SHAREHOLDERS PERCENTAGE OWNERSHIP;



ASSUME LIABILITIES;



RECORD GOODWILL AND NON-AMORTIZABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS THAT WILL BE SUBJECT TO IMPAIRMENT TESTING AND POTENTIAL

PERIODIC IMPAIRMENT CHARGES;



INCUR AMORTIZATION EXPENSES RELATED TO CERTAIN INTANGIBLE ASSETS;



INCUR LARGE AND IMMEDIATE WRITE-OFFS; OR



BECOME SUBJECT TO LITIGATION.

MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS OF HIGH-TECHNOLOGY COMPANIES ARE INHERENTLY RISKY, AND

NO ASSURANCE CAN BE GIVEN THAT OUR PREVIOUS OR FUTURE ACQUISITIONS WILL BE

SUCCESSFUL AND WILL NOT MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, OPERATING

RESULTS, OR FINANCIAL CONDITION. FAILURE TO MANAGE AND SUCCESSFULLY INTEGRATE

ACQUISITIONS WE MAKE COULD HARM OUR BUSINESS AND OPERATING RESULTS IN A

MATERIAL WAY. PRIOR ACQUISITIONS HAVE RESULTED IN A WIDE RANGE OF OUTCOMES,

FROM SUCCESSFUL INTRODUCTION OF NEW PRODUCTS AND TECHNOLOGIES TO AN INABILITY

TO DO SO. EVEN WHEN AN ACQUIRED COMPANY HAS ALREADY DEVELOPED AND MARKETED

PRODUCTS, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT PRODUCT ENHANCEMENTS WILL BE MADE IN A

TIMELY FASHION OR THAT ALL PREACQUISITION DUE DILIGENCE WILL HAVE IDENTIFIED

ALL POSSIBLE ISSUES THAT MIGHT ARISE WITH RESPECT TO SUCH PRODUCTS.

FROM TIME TO TIME, WE HAVE MADE ACQUISITIONS THAT RESULT IN IN-PROCESS RESEARCH

AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES BEING CHARGED IN AN INDIVIDUAL QUARTER. THESE CHARGES

MAY OCCUR IN ANY PARTICULAR QUARTER RESULTING IN VARIABILITY IN OUR QUARTERLY

EARNINGS.

20

SEE ALSO THE DISCUSSION OF RISKS RELATED TO NEW PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT, WHICH ALSO

APPLIES TO ACQUISITIONS, ABOVE UNDER THE RISK FACTOR ENTITLED,

WE DEPEND UPON

THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW PRODUCTS AND ENHANCEMENTS TO EXISTING PRODUCTS AND ARE

SUBJECT TO RAPID CHANGES IN TECHNOLOGY AND THE MARKET.

THE ENTRANCE INTO NEW OR DEVELOPING MARKETS EXPOSES OUR BUSINESS AND OPERATIONS

TO RISKS

AS WE FOCUS ON NEW MARKET OPPORTUNITIES, SUCH AS TRANSPORTING DATA, VOICE, AND

VIDEO TRAFFIC ACROSS THE SAME NETWORK, WE WILL INCREASINGLY COMPETE WITH LARGE

TELECOMMUNICATIONS EQUIPMENT SUPPLIERS AS WELL AS STARTUP COMPANIES. SEVERAL

OF OUR CURRENT AND POTENTIAL COMPETITORS MAY HAVE GREATER RESOURCES, INCLUDING

TECHNICAL AND ENGINEERING RESOURCES, THAN WE DO. ADDITIONALLY, AS CUSTOMERS IN

THESE MARKETS COMPLETE INFRASTRUCTURE DEPLOYMENTS, THEY MAY REQUIRE GREATER

LEVELS OF SERVICE, SUPPORT, AND FINANCING THAN WE HAVE PROVIDED IN THE PAST. WE

EXPECT THAT DEMAND FOR THESE TYPES OF SERVICE OR FINANCING CONTRACTS MAY

INCREASE IN THE FUTURE. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT WE CAN PROVIDE

PRODUCTS, SERVICE, SUPPORT, AND FINANCING TO EFFECTIVELY COMPETE FOR THESE

MARKET OPPORTUNITIES. FURTHER, PROVISION OF GREATER LEVELS OF SERVICES BY US

MAY RESULT IN A DELAY IN THE TIMING OF REVENUE RECOGNITION.

PRODUCT QUALITY PROBLEMS COULD LEAD TO REDUCED REVENUES AND GROSS MARGINS

WE PRODUCE HIGHLY COMPLEX PRODUCTS WHICH INCORPORATE LEADING-EDGE TECHNOLOGY,

INCLUDING BOTH HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE. SOFTWARE TYPICALLY CONTAINS BUGS WHICH

CAN UNEXPECTEDLY INTERFERE WITH EXPECTED OPERATIONS. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE

THAT OUR PRE-SHIPMENT TESTING PROGRAMS WILL BE ADEQUATE TO DETECT ALL DEFECTS 

EITHER IN INDIVIDUAL PRODUCTS OR WHICH COULD AFFECT NUMEROUS SHIPMENTS  WHICH

MIGHT INTERFERE WITH CUSTOMER SATISFACTION, REDUCE SALES OPPORTUNITIES, OR

AFFECT GROSS MARGINS IF THE COST OF REMEDYING THE PROBLEMS EXCEEDED RESERVES

ESTABLISHED FOR THAT PURPOSE. IN THE PAST, WE HAVE HAD TO RECALL CERTAIN

COMPONENTS. WHILE THE COST OF SUCH RECALLS WAS NOT MATERIAL, THERE CAN BE NO

ASSURANCE THAT SUCH A RECALL, DEPENDING ON THE PRODUCT INVOLVED, WOULD NOT HAVE

A MATERIAL IMPACT. AN INABILITY TO CURE A PRODUCT DEFECT COULD RESULT IN THE

FAILURE OF A PRODUCT LINE, AND WITHDRAWAL, AT LEAST TEMPORARILY FROM A PRODUCT

OR MARKET SEGMENT, DAMAGE TO OUR REPUTATION, INVENTORY COSTS, PRODUCT

REENGINEERING EXPENSES, AND A MATERIAL IMPACT ON REVENUES AND MARGINS.

THE INDUSTRY IN WHICH WE COMPETE AND THE INDUSTRIES IN WHICH OUR CUSTOMERS

COMPETE, ARE SUBJECT TO CONSOLIDATION

THERE HAS BEEN A TREND TOWARD INDUSTRY CONSOLIDATION IN OUR MARKETS FOR SEVERAL

YEARS. WE EXPECT THIS TREND TOWARD INDUSTRY CONSOLIDATION TO CONTINUE AS

COMPANIES ATTEMPT TO STRENGTHEN OR HOLD THEIR MARKET POSITIONS IN AN EVOLVING

INDUSTRY. WE BELIEVE THAT INDUSTRY CONSOLIDATION MAY RESULT IN STRONGER

COMPETITORS THAT ARE BETTER ABLE TO COMPETE AS SOLE-SOURCE VENDORS FOR

CUSTOMERS. THIS COULD LEAD TO MORE VARIABILITY IN OPERATING RESULTS AND COULD

HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, OPERATING RESULTS, AND

FINANCIAL CONDITION. FURTHERMORE, PARTICULARLY IN THE SERVICE PROVIDER MARKET,

RAPID CONSOLIDATION WILL LEAD TO FEWER CUSTOMERS, WITH

21

THE EFFECT THAT LOSS OF A MAJOR CUSTOMER COULD HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON

RESULTS NOT ANTICIPATED IN A CUSTOMER MARKETPLACE COMPRISED OF MORE NUMEROUS

PARTICIPANTS.

OUR BUSINESS IS SUBJECT TO RISKS FROM GLOBAL OPERATIONS

WE CONDUCT SIGNIFICANT SALES AND CUSTOMER SUPPORT OPERATIONS IN COUNTRIES

OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES AND ALSO DEPEND ON NON-U.S. OPERATIONS OF OUR

CONTRACT MANUFACTURERS AND OUR DISTRIBUTION PARTNERS. FOR FISCAL 2002, WE

DERIVED 46% OF OUR REVENUES FROM SALES OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES.

ACCORDINGLY, OUR FUTURE RESULTS COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY A

VARIETY OF UNCONTROLLABLE AND CHANGING FACTORS INCLUDING, AMONG OTHERS, FOREIGN

CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES; POLITICAL OR SOCIAL UNREST OR ECONOMIC INSTABILITY IN

A SPECIFIC COUNTRY OR REGION; TRADE PROTECTION MEASURES AND OTHER REGULATORY

REQUIREMENTS WHICH MAY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO IMPORT OR EXPORT OUR PRODUCTS FROM

VARIOUS COUNTRIES; SERVICE PROVIDER AND GOVERNMENT SPENDING PATTERNS AFFECTED

BY POLITICAL CONSIDERATIONS; DIFFICULTIES IN STAFFING AND MANAGING

INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS; AND ADVERSE TAX CONSEQUENCES, INCLUDING IMPOSITION

OF WITHHOLDING OR OTHER TAXES ON PAYMENTS BY SUBSIDIARIES. ANY OR ALL OF THESE

FACTORS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR FUTURE BUSINESS.

WE ARE EXPOSED TO FLUCTUATIONS IN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES

BECAUSE A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR BUSINESS IS CONDUCTED OUTSIDE THE UNITED

STATES, WE FACE EXPOSURE TO ADVERSE MOVEMENTS IN NON-U.S. CURRENCY EXCHANGE

RATES. THESE EXPOSURES MAY CHANGE OVER TIME AS BUSINESS PRACTICES EVOLVE AND

COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS AND CASH FLOWS.

HISTORICALLY, OUR PRIMARY EXPOSURES HAVE RELATED TO NON-DOLLAR-DENOMINATED

SALES IN JAPAN, CANADA, AND AUSTRALIA, AND CERTAIN NON-DOLLAR-DENOMINATED

OPERATING EXPENSES IN EUROPE, LATIN AMERICA, AND ASIA, WHERE WE SELL PRIMARILY

IN U.S. DOLLARS. ADDITIONALLY, WE HAVE EXPOSURES TO EMERGING MARKET CURRENCIES

WHICH CAN HAVE EXTREME CURRENCY VOLATILITY. AN INCREASE IN THE VALUE OF THE

DOLLAR COULD INCREASE THE REAL COST TO OUR CUSTOMERS OF OUR PRODUCTS IN THOSE

MARKETS OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES WHERE WE SELL IN DOLLARS, AND A WEAKENED

DOLLAR COULD INCREASE THE COST OF LOCAL OPERATING EXPENSES AND PROCUREMENT OF

RAW MATERIALS TO THE EXTENT WE MUST PURCHASE COMPONENTS IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES.

CURRENTLY, WE HEDGE ONLY THOSE CURRENCY EXPOSURES ASSOCIATED WITH CERTAIN

ASSETS AND LIABILITIES DENOMINATED IN NONFUNCTIONAL CURRENCIES AND PERIODICALLY

WILL HEDGE ANTICIPATED FOREIGN CURRENCY CASH FLOWS. THE HEDGING ACTIVITIES

UNDERTAKEN BY US ARE INTENDED TO OFFSET THE IMPACT OF CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS ON

CERTAIN NONFUNCTIONAL CURRENCY ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. OUR ATTEMPTS TO HEDGE

AGAINST THESE RISKS MAY NOT BE SUCCESSFUL RESULTING IN AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR

NET INCOME.

22

WE ARE EXPOSED TO THE CREDIT RISK OF SOME OF OUR CUSTOMERS AND TO CREDIT

EXPOSURES IN WEAKENED MARKETS

MOST OF OUR SALES ARE ON AN OPEN CREDIT BASIS, WITH PAYMENT TERMS OF 30 DAYS

TYPICALLY IN THE UNITED STATES, AND, BECAUSE OF LOCAL CUSTOMS OR CONDITIONS,

LONGER IN SOME MARKETS OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES. WE MONITOR INDIVIDUAL

CUSTOMER PAYMENT CAPABILITY IN GRANTING SUCH OPEN CREDIT ARRANGEMENTS, SEEK TO

LIMIT SUCH OPEN CREDIT TO AMOUNTS WE BELIEVE THE CUSTOMERS CAN PAY, AND

MAINTAIN RESERVES WE BELIEVE ARE ADEQUATE TO COVER EXPOSURE FOR DOUBTFUL

ACCOUNTS. BEYOND OUR OPEN CREDIT ARRANGEMENTS, WE HAVE ALSO EXPERIENCED

DEMANDS FOR CUSTOMER FINANCING AND FACILITATION OF LEASING ARRANGEMENTS. WE

EXPECT DEMAND FOR CUSTOMER FINANCING TO CONTINUE. WE BELIEVE CUSTOMER

FINANCING IS A COMPETITIVE FACTOR IN OBTAINING BUSINESS, PARTICULARLY IN

SUPPLYING CUSTOMERS INVOLVED IN SIGNIFICANT INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS. OUR LOAN

FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS MAY INCLUDE NOT ONLY FINANCING THE ACQUISITION OF OUR

PRODUCTS BUT ALSO PROVIDING ADDITIONAL FUNDS FOR OTHER COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH

NETWORK INSTALLATION AND INTEGRATION OF OUR PRODUCTS AND FOR WORKING CAPITAL

PURPOSES.

BECAUSE OF THE CURRENT SLOWDOWN IN THE GLOBAL ECONOMY, OUR EXPOSURE TO THE

CREDIT RISKS RELATING TO OUR FINANCING ACTIVITIES DESCRIBED ABOVE HAVE

INCREASED. ALTHOUGH WE HAVE PROGRAMS IN PLACE TO MONITOR AND MITIGATE THE

ASSOCIATED RISK, INCLUDING MONITORING OF PARTICULAR RISKS IN CERTAIN GEOGRAPHIC

AREAS, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT SUCH PROGRAMS WILL BE EFFECTIVE IN

REDUCING OUR CREDIT RISKS. THERE HAVE BEEN SIGNIFICANT BANKRUPTCIES AMONG

CUSTOMERS BOTH ON OPEN CREDIT AND WITH LOAN OR LEASE FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS,

PARTICULARLY AMONG INTERNET BUSINESSES AND SERVICE PROVIDERS, CAUSING US TO

INCUR ECONOMIC OR FINANCIAL LOSSES. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT, SHOULD

ECONOMIC CONDITIONS NOT IMPROVE, ADDITIONAL LOSSES WOULD NOT BE INCURRED, AND

THAT SUCH LOSSES WOULD NOT BE MATERIAL. ALTHOUGH THESE LOSSES HAVE NOT BEEN

MATERIAL TO DATE, FUTURE LOSSES, IF INCURRED, COULD HARM OUR BUSINESS AND HAVE

A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR OPERATING RESULTS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

A PORTION OF OUR SALES IS DERIVED THROUGH OUR RESELLERS IN TWO-TIER

DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS. THESE RESELLERS/CUSTOMERS ARE GENERALLY GIVEN

PRIVILEGES TO RETURN A PORTION OF INVENTORY, RECEIVE CREDITS FOR CHANGES IN

SELLING PRICES, AND PARTICIPATE IN VARIOUS COOPERATIVE MARKETING PROGRAMS. WE

MAINTAIN ESTIMATED ACCRUALS AND ALLOWANCES FOR SUCH EXPOSURES. HOWEVER, SUCH

RESELLERS TEND TO HAVE MORE LIMITED FINANCIAL RESOURCES THAN OTHER RESELLERS

AND END-USER CUSTOMERS AND THEREFORE, REPRESENT POTENTIAL SOURCES OF INCREASED

CREDIT RISK BECAUSE THEY MAY BE MORE LIKELY TO LACK THE RESERVE RESOURCES TO

MEET PAYMENT OBLIGATIONS.

OUR BUSINESS DEPENDS UPON OUR PROPRIETARY RIGHTS, WHICH MIGHT PROVE DIFFICULT

TO ENFORCE, AND THERE IS A RISK OUR PRODUCTS COULD BE HELD TO INFRINGE RIGHTS

OF THIRD PARTIES

WE GENERALLY RELY ON PATENTS, COPYRIGHTS, TRADEMARKS, AND TRADE SECRET LAWS TO

ESTABLISH AND MAINTAIN PROPRIETARY RIGHTS IN OUR TECHNOLOGY AND PRODUCTS.

WHILE WE HAVE BEEN ISSUED A NUMBER OF PATENTS AND OTHER PATENT APPLICATIONS ARE

CURRENTLY PENDING, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE, THAT ANY OF THESE PATENTS WILL

NOT BE CHALLENGED, INVALIDATED, OR CIRCUMVENTED, OR THAT ANY RIGHTS GRANTED

UNDER THESE PATENTS WILL IN FACT PROVIDE COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGES TO US. IN

ADDITION, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT PATENTS WILL BE ISSUED FROM PENDING

APPLICATIONS, OR THAT CLAIMS ALLOWED

23

ON ANY FUTURE PATENTS WILL BE SUFFICIENTLY BROAD TO PROTECT OUR TECHNOLOGY. IN

ADDITION, THE LAWS OF SOME FOREIGN COUNTRIES MAY NOT PROTECT OUR PROPRIETARY

RIGHTS TO THE SAME EXTENT AS DO THE LAWS OF THE UNITED STATES. IF WE ARE

UNABLE TO PROTECT OUR PROPRIETARY RIGHTS IN A MARKET WE MAY FIND OURSELVES AT A

COMPETITIVE DISADVANTAGE TO OTHERS WHO DO NOT HAVE TO INCUR THE SUBSTANTIAL

EXPENSE, TIME AND EFFORT REQUIRED TO CREATE THE INNOVATIVE PRODUCTS WHICH HAVE

ENABLED US TO BE SUCCESSFUL.

FROM TIME TO TIME, THIRD PARTIES HAVE ASSERTED EXCLUSIVE PATENT, COPYRIGHT,

TRADEMARK AND OTHER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS TO TECHNOLOGIES AND RELATED

STANDARDS THAT ARE RELEVANT TO US. THESE ASSERTIONS HAVE INCREASED OVER TIME

AS A RESULT OF OUR GROWTH AND THE GENERAL INCREASE IN THE PACE OF PATENT CLAIMS

ASSERTIONS, PARTICULARLY IN THE UNITED STATES. BECAUSE OF THE EXISTENCE OF A

LARGE NUMBER OF PATENTS IN THE NETWORKING FIELD, THE SECRECY OF SOME PENDING

PATENTS AND THE RAPID RATE OF ISSUANCE OF NEW PATENTS, IT IS NOT ECONOMICALLY

PRACTICAL NOR EVEN POSSIBLE TO DETERMINE IN ADVANCE WHETHER A PRODUCT OR ANY OF

ITS COMPONENTS INFRINGE OR WILL INFRINGE THE PATENT RIGHTS OF OTHERS. THIRD

PARTIES, INCLUDING CUSTOMERS, HAVE ASSERTED CLAIMS AND/OR INITIATED LITIGATION,

AND MAY IN THE FUTURE ASSERT CLAIMS OR INITIATE LITIGATION, AGAINST US OR OUR

MANUFACTURERS, SUPPLIERS, OR CUSTOMERS, ALLEGING INFRINGEMENT OF THEIR

PROPRIETARY RIGHTS WITH RESPECT TO OUR EXISTING OR FUTURE PRODUCTS OR

COMPONENTS OF THOSE PRODUCTS. REGARDLESS OF THE MERIT OF THESE CLAIMS, THEY

CAN BE TIME-CONSUMING, RESULT IN COSTLY LITIGATION AND DIVERSION OF TECHNICAL

AND MANAGEMENT PERSONNEL, OR REQUIRE US TO DEVELOP A NON-INFRINGING TECHNOLOGY

OR ENTER INTO LICENSE AGREEMENTS; WHERE CLAIMS ARE MADE BY CUSTOMERS,

RESISTANCE EVEN TO UNMERITORIOUS CLAIMS COULD DAMAGE CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIPS.

THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT LICENSES WILL BE AVAILABLE ON ACCEPTABLE TERMS

AND CONDITIONS, IF AT ALL, IN ALL SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES, OR THAT OUR

INDEMNIFICATION BY THEIR SUPPLIERS WILL BE ADEQUATE TO COVER THEIR COSTS IF A

CLAIM WERE BROUGHT DIRECTLY AGAINST US OR OUR CUSTOMERS. IF ANY INFRINGEMENT

OR OTHER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY CLAIM MADE AGAINST US BY ANY THIRD PARTY IS

SUCCESSFUL, OR IF WE FAIL TO DEVELOP NON-INFRINGING TECHNOLOGY OR LICENSE THE

PROPRIETARY RIGHTS ON COMMERCIALLY REASONABLE TERMS AND CONDITIONS, OUR

BUSINESS, OPERATING RESULTS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION COULD BE MATERIALLY AND

ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

MANY OF OUR PRODUCTS ARE DESIGNED TO INCLUDE SOFTWARE OR OTHER INTELLECTUAL

PROPERTY LICENSED FROM THIRD PARTIES. IT MAY BE NECESSARY IN THE FUTURE TO

SEEK OR RENEW LICENSES RELATING TO VARIOUS ASPECTS OF THESE PRODUCTS. THERE

CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THE NECESSARY LICENSES WOULD BE AVAILABLE ON

ACCEPTABLE TERMS, IF AT ALL. THE INABILITY TO OBTAIN CERTAIN LICENSES OR OTHER

RIGHTS OR TO OBTAIN SUCH LICENSES OR RIGHTS ON FAVORABLE TERMS, OR THE NEED TO

ENGAGE IN LITIGATION REGARDING THESE MATTERS, COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE

EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, OPERATING RESULTS, AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. MOREOVER,

THE INCLUSION IN OUR PRODUCTS OF SOFTWARE OR OTHER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

LICENSED FROM THIRD PARTIES ON A NON-EXCLUSIVE BASIS COULD LIMIT OUR ABILITY TO

PROTECT OUR PROPRIETARY RIGHTS IN OUR PRODUCTS.

24

WE FACE RISKS FROM THE UNCERTAINTIES OF REGULATION OF THE INTERNET

CURRENTLY, FEW LAWS OR REGULATIONS APPLY DIRECTLY TO ACCESS OR COMMERCE ON THE

INTERNET. WE COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY REGULATION OF THE

INTERNET AND INTERNET COMMERCE IN ANY COUNTRY WHERE WE OPERATE. SUCH

REGULATIONS COULD INCLUDE MATTERS SUCH AS VOICE OVER THE INTERNET OR USING

INTERNET PROTOCOL, ENCRYPTION TECHNOLOGY, AND ACCESS CHARGES FOR INTERNET

SERVICE PROVIDERS. OUR BUSINESS COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY THE

CHANGES IN THE REGULATIONS SURROUNDING THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS INDUSTRY. THE

ADOPTION OF REGULATION OF THE INTERNET AND INTERNET COMMERCE COULD DECREASE

DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS, AND AT THE SAME TIME INCREASE THE COST OF SELLING OUR

PRODUCTS, WHICH COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, OPERATING

RESULTS, AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

OUR SUCCESS LARGELY DEPENDS ON OUR ABILITY TO RETAIN AND RECRUIT KEY PERSONNEL

OUR SUCCESS HAS ALWAYS DEPENDED IN LARGE PART ON OUR ABILITY TO ATTRACT AND

RETAIN HIGHLY SKILLED TECHNICAL, MANAGERIAL, SALES, AND MARKETING PERSONNEL.

IN SPITE OF THE ECONOMIC SLOWDOWN, COMPETITION FOR THESE PERSONNEL IS INTENSE,

ESPECIALLY IN THE SILICON VALLEY AREA OF NORTHERN CALIFORNIA. VOLATILITY OR

LACK OF POSITIVE PERFORMANCE IN OUR STOCK PRICE MAY ALSO ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR

ABILITY TO RETAIN KEY EMPLOYEES, ALL OF WHOM HAVE BEEN GRANTED STOCK OPTIONS.

THE LOSS OF SERVICES OF ANY OF OUR KEY PERSONNEL, THE INABILITY TO RETAIN AND

ATTRACT QUALIFIED PERSONNEL IN THE FUTURE, OR DELAYS IN HIRING REQUIRED

PERSONNEL, PARTICULARLY ENGINEERING AND SALES PERSONNEL, COULD MAKE IT

DIFFICULT TO MEET KEY OBJECTIVES, SUCH AS TIMELY AND EFFECTIVE PRODUCT

INTRODUCTIONS. IN ADDITION, COMPANIES IN THE NETWORKING INDUSTRY WHOSE

EMPLOYEES ACCEPT POSITIONS WITH COMPETITORS FREQUENTLY CLAIM THAT COMPETITORS

HAVE ENGAGED IN IMPROPER HIRING PRACTICES. WE HAVE RECEIVED THESE CLAIMS IN

THE PAST AND MAY RECEIVE ADDITIONAL CLAIMS TO THIS EFFECT IN THE FUTURE.

WE FACE CERTAIN LITIGATION RISKS

WE ARE A PARTY TO LAWSUITS IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF OUR BUSINESS. LITIGATION

CAN BE EXPENSIVE, LENGTHY, AND DISRUPTIVE TO NORMAL BUSINESS OPERATIONS.

MOREOVER, THE RESULTS OF COMPLEX LEGAL PROCEEDINGS ARE DIFFICULT TO PREDICT.

AN UNFAVORABLE RESOLUTION OF A PARTICULAR LAWSUIT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE

EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, OPERATING RESULTS, OR FINANCIAL CONDITION. FOR

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING CERTAIN OF THE LAWSUITS IN WHICH WE ARE

INVOLVED, SEE ITEM 3, LEGAL PROCEEDINGS, CONTAINED IN PART I OF THIS REPORT.

CHANGES IN EFFECTIVE TAX RATES COULD AFFECT OUR RESULTS

OUR FUTURE EFFECTIVE TAX RATES COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY EARNINGS BEING

LOWER THAN ANTICIPATED IN COUNTRIES WHERE WE HAVE LOWER STATUTORY RATES,

CHANGES IN THE VALUATION OF OUR DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, OR BY

CHANGES IN TAX LAWS OR INTERPRETATIONS THEREOF.

25

OUR BUSINESS IS ESPECIALLY SUBJECT TO THE RISKS OF EARTHQUAKES, FLOODS, AND

OTHER NATURAL CATASTROPHIC EVENTS, AND TO INTERRUPTION BY MANMADE PROBLEMS SUCH

AS COMPUTER VIRUSES OR TERRORISM

OUR CORPORATE HEADQUARTERS, INCLUDING CERTAIN OF OUR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

OPERATIONS AND OUR MANUFACTURING FACILITIES, ARE LOCATED IN THE SILICON VALLEY

AREA OF NORTHERN CALIFORNIA, A REGION KNOWN FOR SEISMIC ACTIVITY.

ADDITIONALLY, CERTAIN OF OUR FACILITIES, WHICH INCLUDE ONE OF OUR MANUFACTURING

FACILITIES, ARE LOCATED NEAR RIVERS THAT HAVE EXPERIENCED FLOODING IN THE PAST.

A SIGNIFICANT NATURAL DISASTER, SUCH AS AN EARTHQUAKE OR A FLOOD, COULD HAVE A

MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR BUSINESS, OPERATING RESULTS, AND FINANCIAL

CONDITION. IN ADDITION, DESPITE OUR IMPLEMENTATION OF NETWORK SECURITY

MEASURES, OUR SERVERS ARE VULNERABLE TO COMPUTER VIRUSES, BREAK-INS, AND

SIMILAR DISRUPTIONS FROM UNAUTHORIZED TAMPERING WITH OUR COMPUTER SYSTEMS. ANY

SUCH EVENT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, OPERATING

RESULTS, AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. IN ADDITION, THE EFFECTS OF WAR OR ACTS OF

TERRORISM COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, OPERATING

RESULTS, AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. THE TERRORIST ATTACKS IN NEW YORK AND

WASHINGTON, D.C. ON SEPTEMBER 11, 2001 DISRUPTED COMMERCE THROUGHOUT THE WORLD

AND INTENSIFIED THE UNCERTAINTY OF THE U.S. AND OTHER ECONOMIES. THE CONTINUED

THREAT OF TERRORISM AND HEIGHTENED SECURITY AND MILITARY ACTION IN RESPONSE TO

THIS THREAT, OR ANY FUTURE ACTS OF TERRORISM, MAY CAUSE FURTHER DISRUPTIONS TO

THESE ECONOMIES AND CREATE FURTHER UNCERTAINTIES. TO THE EXTENT THAT SUCH

DISRUPTIONS OR UNCERTAINTIES RESULT IN DELAYS OR CANCELLATIONS OF CUSTOMER

ORDERS, OR THE MANUFACTURE OR SHIPMENT OF OUR PRODUCTS, OUR BUSINESS, OPERATING

RESULTS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION COULD BE MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

WE ARE EXPOSED TO FLUCTUATIONS IN THE MARKET VALUES OF OUR PORTFOLIO

INVESTMENTS AND IN INTEREST RATES

WE MAINTAIN AN INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO OF VARIOUS HOLDINGS, TYPES, AND MATURITIES.

THESE SECURITIES ARE GENERALLY CLASSIFIED AS AVAILABLE FOR SALE AND,

CONSEQUENTLY, ARE RECORDED ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS AT FAIR VALUE

WITH UNREALIZED GAINS OR LOSSES REPORTED AS A SEPARATE COMPONENT OF ACCUMULATED

OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS), NET OF TAX. PART OF THIS PORTFOLIO INCLUDES

EQUITY INVESTMENTS IN SEVERAL PUBLICLY TRADED COMPANIES, THE VALUES OF WHICH

ARE SUBJECT TO MARKET PRICE VOLATILITY. RECENT EVENTS HAVE ADVERSELY AFFECTED

THE PUBLIC EQUITIES MARKET AND GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS MAY CONTINUE TO

WORSEN. AS A RESULT, WE MAY RECOGNIZE IN EARNINGS THE DECLINE IN FAIR VALUE OF

OUR PUBLICLY TRADED EQUITY INVESTMENTS BELOW THE COST BASIS WHEN THE DECLINE IS

JUDGED TO BE OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY. FOR INFORMATION REGARDING THE SENSITIVITY

OF AND RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE MARKET VALUE OF PORTFOLIO INVESTMENTS AND

INTEREST RATES, SEE THE SECTION TITLED QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE

DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK ON PAGES 23 AND 24 OF OUR 2002 ANNUAL REPORT TO

SHAREHOLDERS WHICH IS INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE HEREIN. FURTHERMORE, OUR EQUITY

INVESTMENTS IN BOTH PUBLICLY TRADED COMPANIES AND PRIVATE COMPANIES ARE SUBJECT

TO RISK OF LOSS OF INVESTMENT CAPITAL. THESE INVESTMENTS ARE INHERENTLY RISKY

AS THE MARKET FOR THE TECHNOLOGIES OR PRODUCTS THEY HAVE UNDER DEVELOPMENT ARE

TYPICALLY IN THE EARLY STAGES AND MAY NEVER MATERIALIZE. WE COULD LOSE OUR

ENTIRE INVESTMENT IN THESE COMPANIES.

26

WE ARE SUBJECT TO RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH STRATEGIC ALLIANCES

WE HAVE SEVERAL STRATEGIC ALLIANCES WITH LARGE AND COMPLEX ORGANIZATIONS AND

OTHER COMPANIES WITH WHOM WE WORK TO OFFER COMPLEMENTARY PRODUCTS AND SERVICES.

THESE ARRANGEMENTS ARE GENERALLY LIMITED TO SPECIFIC PROJECTS, THE GOAL OF

WHICH IS GENERALLY TO FACILITATE PRODUCT COMPATIBILITY AND ADOPTION OF INDUSTRY

STANDARDS. IF SUCCESSFUL, THESE RELATIONSHIPS MAY BE MUTUALLY BENEFICIAL AND

RESULT IN INDUSTRY GROWTH. HOWEVER, THESE ALLIANCES CARRY AN ELEMENT OF RISK

BECAUSE, IN MOST CASES, WE MUST COMPETE IN SOME BUSINESS AREAS WITH A COMPANY

WITH WHICH WE HAVE A STRATEGIC ALLIANCE AND, AT THE SAME TIME, COOPERATE WITH

THAT COMPANY IN OTHER BUSINESS AREAS. ALSO, IF THESE COMPANIES FAIL TO PERFORM

OR IF THESE RELATIONSHIPS FAIL TO MATERIALIZE AS EXPECTED, WE COULD SUFFER

DELAYS IN PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT OR OTHER OPERATIONAL DIFFICULTIES.

WE FACE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH CHANGES IN TELECOMMUNICATIONS REGULATION AND

TARIFFS

CHANGES IN TELECOMMUNICATIONS REQUIREMENTS IN THE UNITED STATES OR OTHER

COUNTRIES COULD AFFECT THE SALES OF OUR PRODUCTS. IN PARTICULAR, WE BELIEVE IT

IS POSSIBLE THAT THERE MAY BE CHANGES IN U.S. TELECOMMUNICATIONS REGULATIONS IN

THE FUTURE THAT COULD SLOW THE EXPANSION OF THE SERVICE PROVIDERS NETWORK

INFRASTRUCTURES AND MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, OPERATING

RESULTS, AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. FUTURE CHANGES IN TARIFFS BY REGULATORY

AGENCIES OR APPLICATION OF TARIFF REQUIREMENTS TO CURRENTLY UNTARIFFED SERVICES

COULD AFFECT THE SALES OF OUR PRODUCTS FOR CERTAIN CLASSES OF CUSTOMERS.

ADDITIONALLY, IN THE UNITED STATES, OUR PRODUCTS MUST COMPLY WITH VARIOUS

FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION REQUIREMENTS AND REGULATIONS. IN COUNTRIES

OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES, OUR PRODUCTS MUST MEET VARIOUS REQUIREMENTS OF

LOCAL TELECOMMUNICATIONS AUTHORITIES. CHANGES IN TARIFFS OR FAILURE BY US TO

OBTAIN TIMELY APPROVAL OF PRODUCTS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR

BUSINESS, OPERATING RESULTS, AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

OUR STOCK PRICE MAY CONTINUE TO BE VOLATILE

OUR COMMON STOCK HAS EXPERIENCED SUBSTANTIAL PRICE VOLATILITY, PARTICULARLY AS

A RESULT OF VARIATIONS BETWEEN OUR ACTUAL FINANCIAL RESULTS, AND THE PUBLISHED

EXPECTATIONS OF ANALYSTS, AND AS A RESULT OF ANNOUNCEMENTS BY OUR COMPETITORS

AND US. FURTHERMORE, SPECULATION IN THE PRESS OR INVESTMENT COMMUNITY ABOUT

OUR STRATEGIC POSITION, FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, BUSINESS OR

SIGNIFICANT TRANSACTIONS CAN CAUSE CHANGES IN STOCK PRICE. IN ADDITION, THE

STOCK MARKET HAS EXPERIENCED EXTREME PRICE AND VOLUME FLUCTUATIONS THAT HAVE

AFFECTED THE MARKET PRICE OF MANY TECHNOLOGY COMPANIES, IN PARTICULAR, AND THAT

HAVE OFTEN BEEN UNRELATED TO THE OPERATING PERFORMANCE OF THESE COMPANIES.

THESE FACTORS, AS WELL AS GENERAL ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL CONDITIONS, MAY

MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE MARKET PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK IN THE FUTURE.

ADDITIONALLY, VOLATILITY OR A LACK OF POSITIVE PERFORMANCE IN OUR STOCK PRICE

MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO RETAIN KEY EMPLOYEES, ALL OF WHOM HAVE BEEN

GRANTED STOCK OPTIONS.

27

ITEM 2. PROPERTIES

THE COMPANYS HEADQUARTERS IS LOCATED ON AN OWNED SITE IN SAN JOSE, CALIFORNIA.

IN ADDITION TO THIS SITE, THE COMPANY HAS CERTAIN OWNED SITES IN THE UNITED

STATES, BOTH COMPLETED AND UNDER CONSTRUCTION, WHICH INCLUDE FACILITIES IN THE

SURROUNDING AREAS OF SAN JOSE, CALIFORNIA; BOXBOROUGH, MASSACHUSETTS; SALEM,

NEW HAMPSHIRE; RICHARDSON, TEXAS; AND RESEARCH TRIANGLE PARK, NORTH CAROLINA.

THE COMPANY ALSO HAS LAND FOR EXPANSION IN SOME OF THESE LOCATIONS.

OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES, THE COMPANY HAS OPERATIONS, PRIMARILY IN LEASED

SITES, IN THE AMERICAS; EMEA; ASIA PACIFIC; AND JAPAN. LARGER SITE LOCATIONS

INCLUDE THE UNITED KINGDOM, FRANCE, BELGIUM, THE NETHERLANDS, SINGAPORE, HONG

KONG, AUSTRALIA, JAPAN, AND INDIA. THE COMPANY HAS OWNED AND LEASED

MANUFACTURING FACILITIES, WHICH ARE PRIMARILY TEST AND ASSEMBLY OPERATIONS, IN

THREE LOCATIONS IN THE UNITED STATES AND NONE INTERNATIONALLY. WE BELIEVE THAT

OUR EXISTING PROPERTIES ARE IN GOOD CONDITION AND SUITABLE FOR THE CONDUCT OF

OUR BUSINESS.

FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING THE COMPANYS OBLIGATIONS UNDER LEASES,

SEE NOTE 8, COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES, ON PAGES 38 TO 40 OF THE COMPANYS

2002 ANNUAL REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS, WHICH IS INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE HEREIN.

FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING THE COMPANYS PROPERTIES BY OPERATING

SEGMENT, SEE NOTE 12, SEGMENT INFORMATION AND MAJOR CUSTOMERS ON PAGES 46 AND

47 OF THE COMPANYS 2002 ANNUAL REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS, WHICH IS INCORPORATED

BY REFERENCE HEREIN.

ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

THE COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO LEGAL PROCEEDINGS, CLAIMS, AND LITIGATION ARISING IN

THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS. WHILE THE OUTCOME OF THESE MATTERS IS

CURRENTLY NOT DETERMINABLE, MANAGEMENT DOES NOT EXPECT THAT THE ULTIMATE COSTS

TO RESOLVE THESE MATTERS WILL HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANYS

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL POSITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, OR CASH FLOWS.

BEGINNING ON APRIL 20, 2001, A NUMBER OF PURPORTED SHAREHOLDER CLASS ACTION

LAWSUITS WERE FILED IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE NORTHERN

DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA AGAINST CISCO AND CERTAIN OF ITS OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS.

THE LAWSUITS HAVE BEEN CONSOLIDATED, AND THE CONSOLIDATED ACTION IS

PURPORTEDLY BROUGHT ON BEHALF OF THOSE WHO PURCHASED THE COMPANYS PUBLICLY

TRADED SECURITIES BETWEEN AUGUST 10, 1999 AND FEBRUARY 6, 2001. PLAINTIFFS

ALLEGE THAT DEFENDANTS HAVE MADE FALSE AND MISLEADING STATEMENTS, PURPORT TO

ASSERT CLAIMS FOR VIOLATIONS OF THE FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS, AND SEEK

UNSPECIFIED COMPENSATORY DAMAGES AND OTHER RELIEF. CISCO BELIEVES THE CLAIMS

ARE WITHOUT MERIT AND INTENDS TO DEFEND THE ACTIONS VIGOROUSLY.

IN ADDITION, BEGINNING ON APRIL 23, 2001, A NUMBER OF PURPORTED SHAREHOLDER

DERIVATIVE LAWSUITS WERE FILED IN THE SUPERIOR COURT OF CALIFORNIA, COUNTY OF

SANTA CLARA AND IN THE SUPERIOR COURT OF CALIFORNIA, COUNTY OF SAN MATEO.

THERE IS A PROCEDURE IN PLACE FOR THE COORDINATION OF SUCH ACTIONS. TWO

PURPORTED DERIVATIVE SUITS HAVE ALSO BEEN FILED IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT

COURT FOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA, AND THOSE FEDERAL COURT ACTIONS

HAVE BEEN CONSOLIDATED. THE COMPLAINTS IN THE VARIOUS DERIVATIVE ACTIONS

INCLUDE CLAIMS FOR BREACH OF FIDUCIARY DUTY, WASTE OF CORPORATE ASSETS,

MISMANAGEMENT, UNJUST ENRICHMENT, AND VIOLATIONS OF THE CALIFORNIA

28

CORPORATIONS CODE; SEEK COMPENSATORY AND OTHER DAMAGES, DISGORGEMENT AND OTHER

RELIEF; AND ARE BASED ON ESSENTIALLY THE SAME ALLEGATIONS AS THE CLASS ACTIONS.
