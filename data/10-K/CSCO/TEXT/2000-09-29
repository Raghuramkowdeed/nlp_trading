END-TO-END NETWORKING SOLUTIONS

CISCO IS THE WORLDWIDE LEADER IN NETWORKING FOR THE INTERNET. THE CISCO STRATEGY

IS TO PROVIDE END-TO-END NETWORKING SOLUTIONS TO HELP ITS CUSTOMERS IMPROVE

PRODUCTIVITY AND GAIN A COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE IN TODAY'S GLOBAL ECONOMY. CISCO

HELPS ITS CUSTOMERS BUILD THEIR OWN NETWORK INFRASTRUCTURE WHILE ALSO PROVIDING

TOOLS TO ALLOW THEM TO COMMUNICATE TO THEIR CUSTOMERS, PROSPECTS, BUSINESS

PARTNERS, SUPPLIERS, AND EMPLOYEES. AN END-TO-END NETWORKING SOLUTION ALLOWS

NETWORK SERVICES TO BE CONSISTENTLY PROVIDED TO ALL USERS ON THE NETWORK.

CISCO'S PRODUCT PORTFOLIO OFFERS A BROAD RANGE OF END-TO-END NETWORKING

HARDWARE, SOFTWARE, AND SERVICES. PRODUCTS ARE USED INDIVIDUALLY OR IN

COMBINATIONS TO CONNECT COMPUTING DEVICES TO NETWORKS OR COMPUTER NETWORKS WITH

EACH OTHER -- WHETHER THEY ARE WITHIN A BUILDING, ACROSS A CAMPUS, OR AROUND THE

WORLD. THE COMPANY'S BREADTH OF PRODUCT OFFERINGS ENABLES IT TO OFFER A WIDE

RANGE OF SOLUTIONS TO MEET CUSTOMER REQUIREMENTS. MANY OF THE COMPANY'S PRODUCTS

ARE EASILY UPGRADED OR EXPANDED, OFFERING CUSTOMERS THE ABILITY TO EXTEND THEIR

NETWORKS AS THEIR NEEDS GROW.

THE COMPANY ALSO PROVIDES PRODUCTS AND SERVICES THAT ALLOW CUSTOMERS TO

TRANSITION THEIR DATA NETWORKS TO A SINGLE MULTISERVICE DATA, VOICE, AND VIDEO

NETWORK.

CISCO PRODUCT OFFERINGS FALL INTO SEVERAL CATEGORIES.

ROUTING

ROUTING IS A FOUNDATION TECHNOLOGY FOR COMPUTER NETWORKING. ROUTERS MOVE

INFORMATION FROM ONE NETWORK TO ANOTHER, APPLYING INTELLIGENCE IN THE PROCESS TO

ENSURE THAT THE INFORMATION REACHES ITS DESTINATION SECURELY AND IN THE MOST

DIRECT WAY POSSIBLE. CISCO OFFERS A BROAD RANGE OF ROUTERS THAT CAN BE USED FROM

A LARGE BACKBONE INFRASTRUCTURE TO A SMALL OFFICE, INCLUDING THE CISCO 12000

GIGABIT SWITCH ROUTER ("GSR") SERIES; THE CISCO 7500 SERIES; THE CISCO 4000

SERIES; AND THE CISCO 8500, 3600, 2600, 2500, 1000, 800, AND 700 PRODUCT

FAMILIES.

SWITCHING

SWITCHING IS ANOTHER IMPORTANT NETWORKING TECHNOLOGY THAT IS USED IN BOTH

LOCAL-AREA NETWORKS ("LANS") AND WIDE-AREA NETWORKS ("WANS"). CISCO'S SWITCHING

STRATEGY IS DESIGNED TO HELP USERS MIGRATE FROM TRADITIONAL SHARED LANS TO FULLY

SWITCHED NETWORKS BY DELIVERING PRODUCTS THAT SUPPORT THE VARYING LEVELS OF

FLEXIBILITY, COST-EFFECTIVENESS, AND HIGH BANDWIDTH REQUIRED FOR TODAY'S

DESKTOP, WORKGROUP, AND BACKBONE APPLICATIONS. CISCO SOLUTIONS EMPLOY ALL WIDELY

USED SWITCHING TECHNOLOGIES --

4

5

ETHERNET, GIGABIT ETHERNET, TOKEN RING, AND ASYNCHRONOUS TRANSFER MODE ("ATM").

CISCO'S LAN SWITCHING PRODUCTS INCLUDE THE CATALYST(R) PRODUCT FAMILY, AND ITS

WAN SWITCHING PRODUCTS INCLUDE THE CISCO IGX(TM), CISCO BPX(R), CISCO TGX, AND

CISCO MGX(TM) FAMILIES.

ACCESS

TODAY, PEOPLE NEED REMOTE ACCESS TO THE INTERNET OR TO A NETWORK THAT IS USED

FOR A VARIETY OF PERSONAL, PROFESSIONAL, OR WORK-RELATED APPLICATIONS. CISCO

ACCESS SOLUTIONS GIVE GROUPS AND INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE REMOTELY LOCATED SIMILAR

LEVELS OF CONNECTIVITY AND INFORMATION ACCESS, AS THEY WOULD HAVE IF THEY WERE

LOCATED AT THE COMPANY'S HEAD OFFICE OR AT HOME. ASYNCHRONOUS AND INTEGRATED

SERVICES DIGITAL NETWORK ("ISDN") REMOTE-ACCESS ROUTERS, DIAL-UP ACCESS SERVERS,

DIGITAL SUBSCRIBER LINE ("DSL") TECHNOLOGIES, AND CABLE UNIVERSAL BROADBAND

ROUTERS PROVIDE TELECOMMUTERS AND MOBILE WORKERS AND STUDENTS WITH REMOTE

ACCESS SERVERS; THE CISCO 6100 AND 6200 LINES OF DIGITAL SUBSCRIBER LINE ACCESS

MULTIPLEXERS ("DSLAM"); THE CISCO UBR7200 UNIVERSAL BROADBAND ROUTER CABLE

HEAD-END EQUIPMENT; ACCESS ROUTERS SUCH AS THE CISCO 6000, 4000, 3800, 3600,

2600, 1700, AND 1600 FAMILIES; AND THE CISCO ISR 3303 INTEGRATED SONET/SDH

ROUTER, AND NETWORK SECURITY AND MANAGEMENT SOFTWARE.

OTHER

THE OTHER PRODUCT OFFERINGS CONSISTS OF SYSTEMS NETWORK ARCHITECTURE, INTERNET

SERVICES, NETWORK MANAGEMENT SOFTWARE, AND CUSTOMER ADVOCACY, AMONG OTHERS, AS

FOLLOWS.

SYSTEMS NETWORK ARCHITECTURE

MOST LARGE ORGANIZATIONS HAVE EXISTING IBM COMPUTING SYSTEMS THAT USE THE

SYSTEMS NETWORK ARCHITECTURE ("SNA") NETWORKING METHOD AS WELL AS LANS BASED ON

OPEN NETWORK ARCHITECTURES [SUCH AS THE TRANSMISSION CONTROL PROTOCOL/INTERNET

PROTOCOL ("TCP/IP")]. INCREASINGLY, NETWORK MANAGERS WANT TO COMBINE THESE TWO

NETWORKS INTO A SINGLE NETWORK THAT LEVERAGES EXISTING INVESTMENTS. CISCO

PROVIDES A BROAD RANGE OF PRODUCTS AND SOLUTIONS FOR THE IBM MARKETPLACE THAT

MAXIMIZES AVAILABILITY, SCALABILITY, PERFORMANCE, FLEXIBILITY, AND MANAGEMENT.

THESE PRODUCTS PROVIDE IBM NETWORKS WITH A CLEAR MIGRATION PATH TO THE FUTURE

WHILE PROTECTING INVESTMENTS IN EXISTING EQUIPMENT AND APPLICATIONS.

INTERNET SERVICE

CISCO OFFERS END-TO-END INTERNET SERVICES TO IMPROVE A NETWORK MANAGER'S ABILITY

TO COPE WITH CHALLENGES POSED BY THE GROWING POPULARITY OF THE INTERNET, SUCH AS

NETWORK TRAFFIC VOLUME AND NETWORK ADDRESS SHORTAGES. CISCO INTERNET SERVICE

UNITS ("ISUS")

5

6

DRIVE ARCHITECTURAL CONSISTENCY ACROSS THE COMPANY BY FOCUSING ON

STANDARDS-BASED SERVICES BETWEEN CLIENTS AND SERVERS SUCH AS END-TO-END QUALITY

OF SERVICE ("QOS") AND END-TO-END SECURITY. CISCO ISU PRODUCTS INCLUDE: THE

PIX(TM) FIREWALL FAMILY, WHICH PREVENTS UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS TO A NETWORK; THE

NETSONAR(TM) SYSTEM, WHICH SCANS THE NETWORK FOR SECURITY RISKS; THE

NETRANGER(R) SYSTEM, WHICH DETECTS AND RESPONDS TO UNAUTHORIZED ACTIVITY OR

NETWORK ATTACKS; CISCO SECURE VPN CLIENT 1.0, WHICH ENSURES DATA PRIVACY WHEN

ACCESSING THE NETWORK REMOTELY; CISCO LOCALDIRECTOR, CISCO CACHE ENGINE, AND

CISCO DISTRIBUTEDDIRECTOR, WHICH BALANCE THE LOAD BETWEEN MULTIPLE SERVERS TO

ENABLE TIMELY ACCESS AND TO ELIMINATE REDUNDANT INTERNET CONTENT; AND THE CISCO

SERVER SUITE 1000, WHICH CONSISTS OF SERVER APPLICATIONS WITH A GRAPHICAL USER

INTERFACE ("GUI").

NETWORK MANAGEMENT SOFTWARE

CISCO IS EXTENDING ITS LEADING INTERNET BUSINESS PRACTICES TO ITS NETWORK

MANAGEMENT VISION AND PRODUCTS. ONE COMPONENT OF THIS INITIATIVE IS

CISCOWORKS2000, A FAMILY OF PRODUCTS BASED ON INTERNET STANDARDS THAT ENABLES

ENTERPRISE CUSTOMERS TO BETTER CONTROL THEIR LARGE, COMPLEX, AND HETEROGENEOUS

NETWORKS AND DEVICES.

IN ORDER FOR SERVICE PROVIDERS TO PROFIT FROM INCREASING NEW BUSINESS

OPPORTUNITIES, SERVICES MUST BE CAREFULLY PLANNED, QUICKLY PROVISIONED,

EFFICIENTLY OPERATED, AND ACCURATELY BILLED. THE CISCO SERVICE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

("CSM") IS A NETWORK SERVICE AND DELIVERY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM THAT PROVIDES A

MODULAR SUITE OF SERVICE MANAGEMENT PRODUCTS INTEGRATED WITHIN A COMMON AND

SCALABLE INFRASTRUCTURE. CSM ENABLES SERVICE PROVIDERS TO EFFECTIVELY DEPLOY,

MONITOR, AND MANAGE THESE NEW NETWORK SERVICES, WHILE POTENTIALLY INCREASING

REVENUE AND REDUCING COST.

CISCO CREATED A NEW BUSINESS GROUP FOCUSED ON BUILDING SOFTWARE SOLUTIONS TO

EXPAND THE COMPANY'S TECHNOLOGY OFFERINGS INTO MESSAGING AND CALL CENTERS AND

EXTEND CISCO'S PRESENCE IN THE BROADER MARKET FOR INTELLIGENT CUSTOMER CONTACT

SOFTWARE APPLICATIONS. SOFTWARE APPLICATIONS FROM THIS TEAM WILL PROVIDE

END-USERS WITH THE ABILITY TO UNIFY VOICE-MAIL, E-MAIL, AND FAX TRAFFIC INTO A

SINGLE MAILBOX ACCESSIBLE OVER AN INTERNET-BASED NETWORK INDEPENDENT OF

LOCATION, TIME, OR DEVICE. AND, WHEN CALLING IN FOR CUSTOMER SUPPORT, THEY WILL

BE CONNECTED TO THE BEST AVAILABLE CUSTOMER SERVICE REPRESENTATIVE REGARDLESS OF

PHYSICAL LOCATION.

CUSTOMER ADVOCACY

THE COMPANY ENABLES SUCCESSFUL DEPLOYMENT OF GLOBAL NETWORKS BY PROVIDING

FLEXIBLE SUPPORT SERVICE SOLUTIONS THAT MEET TODAY'S NEEDS, PROVIDE A SMOOTH

TRANSITION TO THE NEW WORLD,

6

7

ENSURE FASTER DEPLOYMENT OF SERVICES, REDUCE AND MANAGE THE RISK ASSOCIATED WITH

RAPIDLY INTEGRATING NEW TECHNOLOGIES, STREAMLINE BUSINESS PROCESSES, AND REDUCE

OPERATING COSTS. CUSTOMER ADVOCACY PROVIDES A BROAD RANGE OF SERVICES, SUCH AS

CONSULTATIVE, TECHNICAL, PROJECT, QUALITY, CUSTOMER SERVICE, AND MAINTENANCE

LEVEL SERVICES, WHICH FURTHER COMPLEMENT CISCO PRODUCT OFFERINGS.

THE FOLLOWING PRODUCT IS OFFERED IN CONJUNCTION WITH ALL OF THE ABOVE PRODUCT

CATEGORIES.

CISCO IOS(R) SOFTWARE

CISCO IOS SOFTWARE IS A COMMON NETWORKING SOFTWARE PLATFORM DEPLOYED ACROSS A

BROAD SPECTRUM OF CISCO PRODUCTS. CISCO IOS SOFTWARE DELIVERS INTELLIGENT

NETWORK SERVICES -- SUCH AS QOS, LOAD-BALANCING, AND MULTICAST FUNCTIONS -- THAT

ENABLE CUSTOMERS TO BUILD A FLEXIBLE NETWORK INFRASTRUCTURE THAT IS SCALABLE,

RELIABLE, AND SECURE. THESE INTELLIGENT NETWORK SERVICES ALSO SUPPORT INTERNET

BUSINESS SOLUTIONS.

AMONG THE EMERGING TYPES OF APPLICATIONS THAT REQUIRE THESE FEATURES ARE

ON-DEMAND MEDIA, ELECTRONIC COMMERCE SERVICES, REAL-TIME TRADING, AND

DISTANCE-LEARNING ACTIVITIES. THESE APPLICATIONS FORM THE FOUNDATION FOR NEW

BUSINESS MODELS THAT INCREASE COMPETITION, IMPROVE CUSTOMER SERVICE, AND ENHANCE

PRODUCTIVITY.

CUSTOMERS AND MARKETS

NETWORKING NEEDS ARE INFLUENCED BY A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING THE SIZE OF

THE ORGANIZATION, NUMBER AND TYPES OF COMPUTER SYSTEMS, GEOGRAPHIC LOCATION, AND

THE APPLICATIONS REQUIRING DATA COMMUNICATIONS. THE CISCO CUSTOMER BASE IS NOT

CONCENTRATED IN ANY PARTICULAR INDUSTRY AND IN EACH OF THE PAST FIVE FISCAL

YEARS, NO SINGLE CUSTOMER HAS ACCOUNTED FOR 10 PERCENT OR MORE OF THE COMPANY'S

NET SALES. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING SEGMENT INFORMATION FOR THE

COMPANY, SEE NOTE 12 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTAINED IN PART

II, ITEM 8.

THE CISCO MARKET STRATEGY ADDRESSES FOUR MAIN CUSTOMER PROFILES.

ENTERPRISE

ENTERPRISE CUSTOMERS GENERALLY ARE LARGE ORGANIZATIONS WITH 500 OR MORE

EMPLOYEES WITH COMPLEX NETWORKING NEEDS, USUALLY SPANNING MULTIPLE LOCATIONS AND

TYPES OF COMPUTER SYSTEMS. ENTERPRISE CUSTOMERS INCLUDE CORPORATIONS, GOVERNMENT

AGENCIES, UTILITIES, AND EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS.

7

8

SERVICE PROVIDERS

THESE CUSTOMERS PROVIDE DATA, VOICE, AND VIDEO COMMUNICATION SERVICES TO

BUSINESSES AND CONSUMERS. THEY INCLUDE REGIONAL, NATIONAL, AND INTERNATIONAL

LONG DISTANCE TELECOMMUNICATIONS CARRIERS, AS WELL AS INTERNET, CABLE, AND

WIRELESS SERVICE PROVIDERS.

SMALL/MEDIUM-SIZED BUSINESSES

THESE CUSTOMERS HAVE LESS THAN 500 EMPLOYEES AND A NEED FOR NETWORKS OF THEIR

OWN, AS WELL AS CONNECTION TO THE INTERNET AND TO BUSINESS PARTNERS. HOWEVER,

THESE CUSTOMERS GENERALLY HAVE LIMITED EXPERTISE IN NETWORKING TECHNOLOGY;

THEREFORE, THE COMPANY ATTEMPTS TO PROVIDE PRODUCTS THAT ARE AFFORDABLE AND EASY

TO INSTALL AND USE.

CONSUMERS

CONSUMERS HAVE A NEED FOR NETWORKING DEVICES AND SERVICES TO CONNECT THEM TO THE

INTERNET FROM WITHIN THEIR HOMES. IN ADDITION, SOME ADVANCED CONSUMERS WILL

NETWORK TOGETHER A RANGE OF DEVICES WITHIN THEIR HOME, LINKING TOGETHER DEVICES

SUCH AS PERSONAL COMPUTER, TELEVISION, TELEPHONE, FAX, AND MORE, INTO AN

INTEGRATED PERSONAL NETWORK. INTERNET ACCESS SERVICES ARE PROVIDED TO THEM

THROUGH REGIONAL CARRIERS AND INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDERS.

CISCO SALES OVERVIEW

THE COMPANY'S WORLDWIDE DIRECT SALES AND MARKETING ORGANIZATION AT JULY 29, 2000

CONSISTED OF APPROXIMATELY 14,000 INDIVIDUALS, INCLUDING MANAGERS, SALES

REPRESENTATIVES, AND TECHNICAL SUPPORT PERSONNEL. THE COMPANY HAS FIELD SALES

OFFICES GLOBALLY PROVIDING COVERAGE THROUGHOUT THE WORLD. ADDITIONALLY, THE

COMPANY'S INTERNATIONAL SALES ARE CURRENTLY BEING MADE THROUGH MULTIPLE CHANNELS

INCLUDING INTERNATIONAL DISTRIBUTORS, RESELLERS, AND DIRECT SALES THROUGHOUT THE

WORLD. THE DISTRIBUTORS PROVIDE SYSTEM INSTALLATION, TECHNICAL SUPPORT, AND

FOLLOW-UP SERVICES TO END-CUSTOMERS. GENERALLY, THE COMPANY'S INTERNATIONAL

DISTRIBUTORS HAVE NONEXCLUSIVE, COUNTRY-WIDE AGREEMENTS. FOR ADDITIONAL

INFORMATION REGARDING THE COMPANY'S INTERNATIONAL SALES, SEE NOTE 12 TO THE

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTAINED IN PART II, ITEM 8.

CISCO CAPITAL SPECIALIZES IN FINANCING NETWORKING EQUIPMENT. CISCO CAPITAL

OFFERS INNOVATIVE, FLEXIBLE FINANCIAL SERVICES TO CISCO'S CUSTOMERS AND CHANNEL

PARTNERS AT COMPETITIVE RATES. OUR SERVICES ARE DESIGNED TO HELP OUR CUSTOMERS

SPREAD THEIR COSTS OF ACQUISITION, MANAGEMENT, AND END-OF-LIFE DISPOSAL

ASSOCIATED WITH NETWORKING PRODUCTS. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING CISCO

CAPITAL'S FINANCING ACTIVITIES, SEE NOTE 5 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS CONTAINED IN PART II, ITEM 8.

ACQUISITIONS, INVESTMENTS AND ALLIANCES

THE END-TO-END NETWORKING STRATEGY PURSUED BY CISCO REQUIRES A WIDE VARIETY OF

TECHNOLOGIES, PRODUCTS, AND CAPABILITIES. THE COMBINATION OF COMPLEXITY AND

RAPID CHANGE MAKE IT DIFFICULT FOR ONE COMPANY, NO MATTER HOW LARGE, TO DEVELOP

ALL TECHNOLOGICAL SOLUTIONS ALONE. ACQUISITIONS, INVESTMENTS, AND ALLIANCES ARE

TOOLS USED BY THE COMPANY TO FILL GAPS IN ITS OFFERINGS AND ENABLE IT TO DELIVER

COMPLETE SOLUTIONS TO CUSTOMERS AND PROSPECTS IN ITS TARGET MARKETS.

SATISFYING CUSTOMERS' NETWORKING NEEDS REQUIRES A CONSTANT MONITORING OF MARKET

AND TECHNOLOGY TRENDS, PLUS AN ABILITY TO ACT QUICKLY. CISCO HAS A FOUR-PART

APPROACH TO SATISFYING THE NEED FOR NEW OR ENHANCED NETWORKING PRODUCTS AND

SOLUTIONS. IN ORDER OF PREFERENCE, THE APPROACH IS TO DEVELOP NEW TECHNOLOGIES

AND PRODUCTS INTERNALLY; ENTER INTO JOINT-DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS WITH OTHER

COMPANIES; RESELL ANOTHER COMPANY'S PRODUCT; AND ACQUIRE ALL OR PART OF ANOTHER

COMPANY.

SINCE 1993, THE COMPANY HAS ACQUIRED A NUMBER OF COMPANIES. THE COMPANY EXPECTS

TO MAKE FUTURE ACQUISITIONS WHERE IT BELIEVES THAT IT CAN ACQUIRE NEW PRODUCTS

AND CHANNELS OF DISTRIBUTION OR OTHERWISE RAPIDLY ENTER NEW OR EMERGING MARKETS.

MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS OF HIGH-TECHNOLOGY COMPANIES ARE INHERENTLY RISKY AND

NO ASSURANCE CAN BE GIVEN THAT THE COMPANY'S PREVIOUS OR FUTURE ACQUISITIONS

WILL BE SUCCESSFUL OR WILL NOT MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANY'S

FINANCIAL CONDITION OR OPERATING RESULTS. THE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH ACQUISITIONS

ARE MORE FULLY DISCUSSED IN THE "RISK FACTORS" SECTION CONTAINED IN ITEM 1 OF

THIS REPORT.

THE COMPANY'S ACQUISITIONS HAVE FURTHERED ITS COMMITMENT TOWARDS PROVIDING AN

END-TO-END NETWORKING SOLUTION. THE COMPANY NOW HAS A BROAD SET OF PRODUCT

OFFERINGS AND TECHNOLOGIES, WHICH INCLUDE ETHERNET, GIGABIT ETHERNET SWITCHING,

TOKEN RING, ATM SWITCHING, SONET/SDH, XDSL, DIAL-UP ACCESS, CONVERGED DATA,

VOICE, AND VIDEO TECHNOLOGIES, TAG SWITCHING [CURRENTLY ALSO KNOWN AS

MULTIPROTOCOL LABEL SWITCHING ("MPLS")], OPTICAL TRANSPORT, WIRELESS, CONTENT

NETWORKING, CALL CENTER AND UNIFIED MESSAGING SOLUTIONS, NETWORK SECURITY, AND

NETWORK MANAGEMENT SOFTWARE SOLUTIONS, AMONG OTHERS.

MINORITY INVESTMENTS

THE COMPANY MAKES MINORITY INVESTMENTS IN COMPANIES THAT BUILD TECHNOLOGY OR

PROVIDE SERVICES THAT ARE COMPLEMENTARY TO CISCO PRODUCTS OR THAT SUPPORT THE

INTERNET. BY INVESTING IN NEW VENTURES, CISCO STRENGTHENS ITS PARTNERSHIPS WITH

SUCH COMPANIES. TOGETHER,

9

10

CISCO AND ITS PARTNERS CAN OFFER MORE COMPLETE SOLUTIONS TO THE MARKET.

STRATEGIC ALLIANCES

CISCO PURSUES STRATEGIC ALLIANCES WITH OTHER INDUSTRY LEADERS IN AREAS WHERE

COLLABORATION CAN PRODUCE INDUSTRY ADVANCEMENT AND ACCELERATION OF NEW MARKETS.

THE OBJECTIVES AND GOALS FOR A STRATEGIC ALLIANCE CAN INCLUDE ONE OR MORE OF THE

FOLLOWING: TECHNOLOGY EXCHANGE, PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT, JOINT SALES AND MARKETING,

AND NEW-MARKET CREATION. THIS YEAR, CISCO EXPANDED OR ENTERED INTO ALLIANCES

WITH CAP GEMINI/ERNST & YOUNG, HEWLETT PACKARD, INTEL, IBM, KPMG CONSULTING,

INC., MICROSOFT, MOTOROLA, ORACLE, SUN MICROSYSTEMS, AND TELCORDIA, AMONG

OTHERS.

BACKLOG

THE COMPANY'S BACKLOG AT SEPTEMBER 25, 2000 WAS APPROXIMATELY $3.83 BILLION

COMPARED WITH A BACKLOG OF APPROXIMATELY $922 MILLION AT SEPTEMBER 20, 1999. THE

COMPANY INCLUDES IN ITS BACKLOG ONLY ORDERS CONFIRMED WITH A PURCHASE ORDER FOR

PRODUCTS TO BE SHIPPED WITHIN 120 DAYS TO CUSTOMERS WITH APPROVED CREDIT STATUS.

BECAUSE OF THE GENERALLY SHORT CYCLE BETWEEN ORDER AND SHIPMENT, AND OCCASIONAL

CUSTOMER CHANGES IN DELIVERY SCHEDULES OR CANCELLATION OF ORDERS (WHICH ARE MADE

WITHOUT SIGNIFICANT PENALTY), THE COMPANY DOES NOT BELIEVE THAT ITS BACKLOG, AS

OF ANY PARTICULAR DATE, IS NECESSARILY INDICATIVE OF ACTUAL NET SALES FOR ANY

FUTURE PERIOD.

COMPETITION

CISCO COMPETES IN THE INTERNET INFRASTRUCTURE MARKET, PROVIDING SOLUTIONS FOR

TRANSPORTING DATA, VOICE, AND VIDEO TRAFFIC ACROSS INTRANETS, EXTRANETS, AND THE

INTERNET. THE MARKET IS CHARACTERIZED BY RAPID GROWTH, CONVERGING TECHNOLOGIES,

AND A CONVERSION TO NEW WORLD SOLUTIONS THAT OFFER SUPERIOR ADVANTAGES. THESE

MARKET FACTORS REPRESENT BOTH AN OPPORTUNITY AND A COMPETITIVE THREAT TO CISCO.

THE COMPANY COMPETES WITH NUMEROUS VENDORS IN EACH PRODUCT CATEGORY. CISCO

EXPECTS THAT THE OVERALL NUMBER OF COMPETITORS PROVIDING NICHE PRODUCT SOLUTIONS

WILL INCREASE DUE TO THE MARKET'S ATTRACTIVE GROWTH. ON THE OTHER HAND, THE

COMPANY EXPECTS THE NUMBER OF VENDORS SUPPLYING END-TO-END NETWORKING SOLUTIONS

WILL DECREASE, DUE TO THE RAPID PACE OF ACQUISITIONS IN THE INDUSTRY. THE

COMPANY BELIEVES ITS PRIMARY COMPETITION COMES FROM NIMBLE START-UPS AND YOUNG

COMPANIES OFFERING INNOVATIVE NICHE SOLUTIONS.

CISCO'S COMPETITORS INCLUDE ALCATEL, ERICSSON, EXTREME, FOUNDRY, JUNIPER,

LUCENT, NORTEL, REDBACK, SIEMENS AG, AND SYCAMORE. SOME OF OUR COMPETITORS

COMPETE ACROSS MANY OF OUR PRODUCT LINES, WHILE OTHERS DO NOT OFFER AS WIDE A

BREADTH OF SOLUTIONS.

10

11

SEVERAL OF OUR CURRENT AND POTENTIAL COMPETITORS HAVE GREATER FINANCIAL,

MARKETING, AND TECHNICAL RESOURCES THAN WE DO.

THE PRINCIPAL COMPETITIVE FACTORS IN THE MARKETS IN WHICH THE COMPANY PRESENTLY

COMPETES AND MAY COMPETE IN THE FUTURE ARE.

-   PRICE AND/OR ABILITY TO PROVIDE FINANCING;

-   PERFORMANCE;

-   THE ABILITY TO PROVIDE END-TO-END NETWORKING SOLUTIONS AND SUPPORT;

-   CONFORMANCE TO STANDARDS;

-   THE ABILITY TO PROVIDE VALUE-ADDED FEATURES SUCH AS SECURITY, RELIABILITY,

AND INVESTMENT PROTECTION; AND

-   MARKET PRESENCE

THE COMPANY ALSO FACES COMPETITION FROM CUSTOMERS IT LICENSES TECHNOLOGY TO AND

SUPPLIERS FROM WHOM IT TRANSFERS TECHNOLOGY. NETWORKING'S INHERENT NATURE

REQUIRES INTER-OPERABILITY. AS SUCH, THE COMPANY MUST COOPERATE AND AT THE SAME

TIME COMPETE WITH THESE COMPANIES. THE COMPANY'S INABILITY TO EFFECTIVELY

MANAGE THESE COMPLICATED RELATIONSHIPS WITH CUSTOMERS AND SUPPLIERS COULD HAVE A

MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS, OPERATING RESULTS, AND

FINANCIAL CONDITION.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

THE COMPANY HAS ENHANCED AND EXTENDED ITS PRODUCT LINES WITH NEW PRODUCT AND

FEATURE INTRODUCTIONS INCLUDING OPTICAL TRANSPORT, DATA, VOICE, AND VIDEO

INTEGRATION, VIRTUAL PRIVATE NETWORKING, DSL, CABLE MODEM, GIGABIT SWITCHING,

WIRELESS, CONTENT NETWORKING (CONTENT DISTRIBUTION AND MANAGEMENT, CONTENT

ROUTING, CONTENT EDGE DELIVERY, CONTENT SWITCHING, AND INTELLIGENT NETWORK

SERVICES), SECURITY, AND NETWORK MANAGEMENT, AMONG OTHERS.

HOWEVER, THE INDUSTRY IN WHICH CISCO COMPETES IN IS SUBJECT TO RAPID

TECHNOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENTS, EVOLVING INDUSTRY STANDARDS, CHANGES IN CUSTOMER

REQUIREMENTS, AND FREQUENT NEW PRODUCT INTRODUCTIONS AND ENHANCEMENTS. AS A

RESULT, THE COMPANY'S SUCCESS, IN PART, DEPENDS UPON ITS ABILITY, ON A

COST-EFFECTIVE AND TIMELY BASIS, TO CONTINUE TO ENHANCE ITS EXISTING SOLUTIONS

AND TO DEVELOP AND INTRODUCE NEW SOLUTIONS THAT IMPROVE PERFORMANCE AND REDUCE

TOTAL COST OF OWNERSHIP. IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE THESE OBJECTIVES, THE COMPANY'S

MANAGEMENT AND ENGINEERING PERSONNEL WORK CLOSELY WITH CUSTOMERS TO IDENTIFY AND

RESPOND TO CUSTOMER NEEDS, AS WELL AS WITH OTHER INNOVATORS OF INTER-NETWORKING

PRODUCTS, INCLUDING UNIVERSITIES, LABORATORIES, AND CORPORATIONS. THE COMPANY

WILL ALSO CONTINUE TO MAKE STRATEGIC ACQUISITIONS AND EQUITY INVESTMENTS WHERE

APPROPRIATE. THE COMPANY INTENDS TO REMAIN DEDICATED TO INDUSTRY STANDARDS AND

TO CONTINUE TO SUPPORT IMPORTANT PROTOCOL STANDARDS AS THEY

11

12

EMERGE. STILL, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT CISCO WILL BE ABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY

DEVELOP NEW PRODUCTS TO ADDRESS NEW CUSTOMER REQUIREMENTS AND TECHNOLOGICAL

CHANGES, OR THAT SUCH PRODUCTS WILL ACHIEVE MARKET ACCEPTANCE.

IN FISCAL 2000, 1999, AND 1998, THE COMPANY'S RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

EXPENDITURES WERE APPROXIMATELY $2.70 BILLION, $1.66 BILLION, AND $1.05 BILLION,

RESPECTIVELY. ALL OF THE COMPANY'S EXPENDITURES FOR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

COSTS, AS WELL AS IN-PROCESS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT OF APPROXIMATELY $1.37

BILLION, $471 MILLION, AND $594 MILLION IN FISCAL 2000, 1999, AND 1998,

RESPECTIVELY, HAVE BEEN EXPENSED AS INCURRED.

MANUFACTURING

THE COMPANY'S MANUFACTURING OPERATIONS PRIMARILY CONSIST OF QUALITY ASSURANCE OF

MATERIALS, COMPONENTS, AND SUBASSEMBLIES. ADDITIONALLY, THE COMPANY PERFORMS

FINAL ASSEMBLY AND TEST. THE COMPANY PRESENTLY USES A VARIETY OF INDEPENDENT

THIRD-PARTY COMPANIES TO PERFORM PRINTED CIRCUIT BOARD ASSEMBLY, IN-CIRCUIT

TEST, AND PRODUCT REPAIR. THE COMPANY AND ITS SINGLE ENTERPRISE PARTNERS INSTALL

PROPRIETARY SOFTWARE ON ELECTRONICALLY PROGRAMMABLE MEMORY CHIPS INSTALLED IN

ITS SYSTEMS IN ORDER TO CONFIGURE PRODUCTS TO CUSTOMER NEEDS AND TO MAINTAIN

QUALITY CONTROL AND SECURITY. THE MANUFACTURING PROCESS ENABLES THE COMPANY TO

CONFIGURE THE HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE IN UNIQUE COMBINATIONS TO MEET A WIDE

VARIETY OF INDIVIDUAL CUSTOMER REQUIREMENTS. THE COMPANY AND ITS SINGLE

ENTERPRISE PARTNERS ALSO USE AUTOMATED TESTING EQUIPMENT AND "BURN-IN"

PROCEDURES, AS WELL AS COMPREHENSIVE INSPECTION, TESTING, AND STATISTICAL

PROCESS CONTROL, TO ASSURE THE QUALITY AND RELIABILITY OF ITS PRODUCTS. THE

COMPANY'S AND ITS PARTNERS' MANUFACTURING PROCESSES AND PROCEDURES ARE ISO 9001

CERTIFIED.

PATENTS, INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND LICENSING

CISCO'S SUCCESS IS DEPENDENT UPON ITS PROPRIETARY TECHNOLOGY. CISCO GENERALLY

RELIES UPON PATENTS, COPYRIGHTS, TRADEMARKS, AND TRADE SECRET LAWS TO ESTABLISH

AND MAINTAIN ITS PROPRIETARY RIGHTS IN ITS TECHNOLOGY AND PRODUCTS. CISCO HAS A

PROGRAM TO FILE APPLICATIONS FOR AND OBTAIN PATENTS IN THE UNITED STATES AND IN

SELECTED FOREIGN COUNTRIES WHERE A POTENTIAL MARKET FOR CISCO'S PRODUCTS EXISTS.

CISCO HAS BEEN ISSUED A NUMBER OF PATENTS; OTHER PATENT APPLICATIONS ARE

CURRENTLY PENDING. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT ANY OF THESE PATENTS WILL NOT

BE CHALLENGED, INVALIDATED, OR CIRCUMVENTED, OR THAT ANY RIGHTS GRANTED

THEREUNDER WILL PROVIDE COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGES TO CISCO. IN ADDITION, THERE CAN

BE NO ASSURANCE THAT PATENTS WILL BE ISSUED FROM PENDING APPLICATIONS, OR THAT

CLAIMS ALLOWED ON ANY FUTURE PATENTS WILL BE SUFFICIENTLY BROAD TO PROTECT

CISCO'S TECHNOLOGY. IN ADDITION, THE LAWS OF SOME FOREIGN COUNTRIES MAY

12

13

NOT PERMIT THE PROTECTION OF CISCO'S PROPRIETARY RIGHTS TO THE SAME EXTENT AS DO

THE LAWS OF THE UNITED STATES. ALTHOUGH CISCO BELIEVES THE PROTECTION AFFORDED

BY ITS PATENTS, PATENT APPLICATIONS, COPYRIGHTS, AND TRADEMARKS HAS VALUE, THE

RAPIDLY CHANGING TECHNOLOGY IN THE NETWORKING INDUSTRY MAKES CISCO'S FUTURE

SUCCESS DEPENDENT PRIMARILY ON THE INNOVATIVE SKILLS, TECHNOLOGICAL EXPERTISE,

AND MANAGEMENT ABILITIES OF ITS EMPLOYEES RATHER THAN ON PATENT, COPYRIGHT, AND

TRADEMARK PROTECTION.

MANY OF CISCO'S PRODUCTS ARE DESIGNED TO INCLUDE SOFTWARE OR OTHER INTELLECTUAL

PROPERTY LICENSED FROM THIRD-PARTIES. WHILE IT MAY BE NECESSARY IN THE FUTURE TO

SEEK OR RENEW LICENSES RELATING TO VARIOUS ASPECTS OF ITS PRODUCTS, CISCO

BELIEVES THAT BASED UPON PAST EXPERIENCE AND STANDARD INDUSTRY PRACTICE, SUCH

LICENSES GENERALLY COULD BE OBTAINED ON COMMERCIALLY REASONABLE TERMS. BECAUSE

OF THE EXISTENCE OF A LARGE NUMBER OF PATENTS IN THE NETWORKING FIELD AND THE

RAPID RATE OF ISSUANCE OF NEW PATENTS, IT IS NOT ECONOMICALLY PRACTICAL TO

DETERMINE IN ADVANCE WHETHER A PRODUCT OR ANY OF ITS COMPONENTS INFRINGE PATENT

RIGHTS OF OTHERS. FROM TIME TO TIME, CISCO RECEIVES NOTICES FROM OR IS SUED BY

THIRD-PARTIES REGARDING PATENT CLAIMS. IF INFRINGEMENT IS ALLEGED, CISCO

BELIEVES THAT, BASED UPON INDUSTRY PRACTICE, ANY NECESSARY LICENSE OR RIGHTS

UNDER SUCH PATENTS MAY BE OBTAINED ON TERMS THAT WOULD NOT HAVE A MATERIAL

ADVERSE EFFECT ON CISCO'S BUSINESS, OPERATING RESULTS, OR FINANCIAL CONDITION.

NEVERTHELESS, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THE NECESSARY LICENSES WOULD BE

AVAILABLE ON ACCEPTABLE TERMS, IF AT ALL, OR THAT CISCO WOULD PREVAIL IN ANY

SUCH CHALLENGE. THE INABILITY TO OBTAIN CERTAIN LICENSES OR OTHER RIGHTS OR TO

OBTAIN SUCH LICENSES OR RIGHTS ON FAVORABLE TERMS, OR THE NEED TO ENGAGE IN

LITIGATION COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON CISCO'S BUSINESS, OPERATING

RESULTS, AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

EMPLOYEES

AS OF JULY 29, 2000, THE COMPANY EMPLOYED APPROXIMATELY 34,000 PERSONS,

INCLUDING 6,000 IN MANUFACTURING, SERVICE AND SUPPORT, 14,000 IN SALES AND

MARKETING, 11,000 IN ENGINEERING, AND 3,000 IN FINANCE AND ADMINISTRATION.

APPROXIMATELY 9,000 EMPLOYEES WERE IN INTERNATIONAL LOCATIONS.

THE COMPANY CONSIDERS THE RELATIONSHIPS WITH ITS EMPLOYEES TO BE POSITIVE. THE

COMPANY HAS NOT EXPERIENCED ANY WORK STOPPAGES.

COMPETITION FOR TECHNICAL PERSONNEL IN THE INDUSTRY THAT CISCO COMPETES IN IS

INTENSE. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT OUR FUTURE SUCCESS DEPENDS IN PART ON OUR

CONTINUED ABILITY TO HIRE, ASSIMILATE, AND RETAIN QUALIFIED PERSONNEL. TO DATE,

CISCO BELIEVES THAT THEY HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN RECRUITING QUALIFIED EMPLOYEES,

BUT THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT THE COMPANY WILL CONTINUE TO BE SUCCESSFUL IN THE

FUTURE.

RISK FACTORS

SET FORTH BELOW AND ELSEWHERE IN THIS REPORT AND IN OTHER DOCUMENTS WE FILE WITH

THE SEC ARE RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES THAT COULD CAUSE ACTUAL RESULTS TO DIFFER

MATERIALLY FROM THE RESULTS CONTEMPLATED BY THE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

CONTAINED IN THIS REPORT.

YOU SHOULD EXPECT THAT OUR OPERATING RESULTS MAY FLUCTUATE IN FUTURE PERIODS

THE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR ANY QUARTER ARE NOT NECESSARILY INDICATIVE OF

RESULTS TO BE EXPECTED IN FUTURE PERIODS. OUR OPERATING RESULTS HAVE IN THE PAST

BEEN, AND WILL CONTINUE TO BE, SUBJECT TO QUARTERLY FLUCTUATIONS AS A RESULT OF

A NUMBER OF FACTORS. THESE FACTORS INCLUDE.

-   THE INTEGRATION OF PEOPLE, OPERATIONS, AND PRODUCTS FROM ACQUIRED BUSINESSES

AND TECHNOLOGIES;

-   INCREASED COMPETITION IN THE NETWORKING INDUSTRY;

-   THE OVERALL TREND TOWARD INDUSTRY CONSOLIDATION;

-   THE INTRODUCTION AND MARKET ACCEPTANCE OF NEW TECHNOLOGIES AND STANDARDS,

INCLUDING SWITCH ROUTERS, GIGABIT ETHERNET SWITCHING, TAG SWITCHING

(CURRENTLY ALSO KNOWN AS MULTIPROTOCOL LABEL SWITCHING ["MPLS"]), OPTICAL

TRANSPORT, WIRELESS, CONTENT NETWORKING AND DATA, VOICE, AND VIDEO

CAPABILITIES;

-   VARIATIONS IN SALES CHANNELS, PRODUCT COSTS, OR MIX OF PRODUCTS SOLD;

-   THE TIMING OF ORDERS AND MANUFACTURING LEAD TIMES;

-   THE TREND TOWARDS SALES OF INTEGRATED NETWORK SOLUTIONS;

-   THE TIMING AND AMOUNT OF EMPLOYER PAYROLL TAX TO BE PAID ON EMPLOYEES' GAINS

ON STOCK OPTIONS EXERCISED; AND

-   CHANGES IN GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND SPECIFIC ECONOMIC CONDITIONS IN

THE COMPUTER AND NETWORKING INDUSTRIES.

ANY OF THE ABOVE FACTORS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR OPERATIONS

AND FINANCIAL RESULTS. FOR EXAMPLE, FROM TIME TO TIME, WE HAVE MADE ACQUISITIONS

THAT RESULT IN IN-PROCESS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES BEING CHARGED IN AN

INDIVIDUAL QUARTER. THESE CHARGES MAY OCCUR IN ANY PARTICULAR QUARTER RESULTING

IN VARIABILITY IN OUR QUARTERLY EARNINGS. ADDITIONALLY, AS A FURTHER EXAMPLE,

THE DOLLAR AMOUNTS OF LARGE ORDERS FOR OUR PRODUCTS HAVE BEEN INCREASING AND

THEREFORE THE OPERATING RESULTS FOR A QUARTER COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY

AFFECTED IF A NUMBER OF LARGE ORDERS ARE EITHER NOT RECEIVED OR ARE DELAYED, FOR

EXAMPLE, DUE TO CANCELLATIONS, DELAYS, OR DEFERRALS BY CUSTOMERS.

14

15

WE CONTINUE TO INVEST IN NEW AND EXISTING MARKET OPPORTUNITIES

WE ARE INVESTING IN INCREASED HEADCOUNT, INVENTORY, MANUFACTURING CAPACITY, AND

PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT THROUGH INTERNAL EFFORTS AND ACQUISITIONS, AS A RESULT OF

GROWTH IN EXISTING OPPORTUNITIES AND NEW OR EMERGING OPPORTUNITIES IN OUR TARGET

MARKETS. WE INTEND TO ADD RESOURCES ACROSS ALL FUNCTIONS.

WITH INCREASED LEVELS OF SPENDING, AN INABILITY TO MEET EXPECTED REVENUE LEVELS

IN A PARTICULAR QUARTER COULD HAVE A MATERIAL, NEGATIVE IMPACT ON OUR OPERATING

RESULTS FOR THAT PERIOD AS WE WILL NOT BE ABLE TO REACT QUICKLY ENOUGH TO SCALE

BACK EXPENSES. INCREASED INVESTMENTS ACROSS ALL FUNCTIONS COULD TRANSLATE INTO A

FASTER RATE OF EXPENSE GROWTH COMPARED TO REVENUE GROWTH.

SINCE OUR GROWTH RATE MAY SLOW, OPERATING RESULTS FOR A PARTICULAR QUARTER ARE

DIFFICULT TO PREDICT

WE EXPECT THAT IN THE FUTURE, OUR NET SALES MAY GROW AT A SLOWER RATE THAN

EXPERIENCED IN PREVIOUS PERIODS AND THAT ON A QUARTER-TO-QUARTER BASIS, OUR

GROWTH IN NET SALES MAY BE SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER THAN OUR HISTORICAL QUARTERLY

GROWTH RATE. AS A CONSEQUENCE, OPERATING RESULTS FOR A PARTICULAR QUARTER ARE

EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO PREDICT. OUR ABILITY TO MEET FINANCIAL EXPECTATIONS COULD

BE HAMPERED IF THE NONLINEAR SALES PATTERN SEEN IN PAST QUARTERS REOCCURS IN

FUTURE PERIODS. WE GENERALLY HAVE HAD ONE QUARTER OF THE FISCAL YEAR WHEN

BACKLOG HAS BEEN REDUCED. ALTHOUGH SUCH REDUCTIONS HAVE NOT OCCURRED

CONSISTENTLY IN RECENT YEARS, THEY ARE DIFFICULT TO PREDICT AND MAY OCCUR IN THE

FUTURE. IN ADDITION, IN RESPONSE TO CUSTOMER DEMAND, WE CONTINUE TO ATTEMPT TO

REDUCE OUR PRODUCT MANUFACTURING LEAD TIMES, WHICH MAY RESULT IN CORRESPONDING

REDUCTIONS IN ORDER BACKLOG. A DECLINE IN BACKLOG LEVELS COULD RESULT IN MORE

VARIABILITY AND LESS PREDICTABILITY IN OUR QUARTER-TO-QUARTER NET SALES AND

OPERATING RESULTS GOING FORWARD. ON THE OTHER HAND, FOR CERTAIN PRODUCTS, LEAD

TIMES ARE LONGER THAN OUR GOAL. IF WE CANNOT REDUCE MANUFACTURING LEAD TIMES FOR

SUCH PRODUCTS, OUR CUSTOMERS MAY CANCEL ORDERS OR NOT PLACE FURTHER ORDERS IF

SHORTER LEAD TIMES ARE AVAILABLE FROM OTHER MANUFACTURERS.

15

16

WE EXPECT GROSS MARGIN TO DECLINE OVER TIME

WE EXPECT GROSS MARGIN MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY INCREASES IN MATERIAL OR

LABOR COSTS, HEIGHTENED PRICE COMPETITION, INCREASING LEVELS OF SERVICES, HIGHER

INVENTORY BALANCES, INTRODUCTION OF NEW PRODUCTS FOR NEW HIGH-GROWTH MARKETS,

AND CHANGES IN CHANNELS OF DISTRIBUTION OR IN THE MIX OF PRODUCTS SOLD. WE

BELIEVE GROSS MARGIN MAY ADDITIONALLY BE IMPACTED DUE TO CONSTRAINTS RELATING TO

CERTAIN COMPONENT SHORTAGES THAT CURRENTLY EXIST IN THE SUPPLY CHAIN. WE MAY

ALSO EXPERIENCE A LOWER GROSS MARGIN AS THE PRODUCT MIX FOR ACCESS AND OPTICAL

PRODUCT VOLUME GROWS.

WE HAVE RECENTLY INTRODUCED SEVERAL NEW PRODUCTS, WITH ADDITIONAL NEW PRODUCTS

SCHEDULED TO BE RELEASED IN THE FUTURE. INCREASE IN DEMAND WOULD RESULT IN

INCREASED MANUFACTURING CAPACITY, WHICH IN TURN WOULD RESULT IN HIGHER INVENTORY

BALANCES. IN ADDITION, OUR VENDOR BASE IS CAPACITY-CONSTRAINED, AND THIS COULD

RESULT IN INCREASED COST PRESSURE ON CERTAIN COMPONENTS. IF PRODUCT OR RELATED

WARRANTY COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THESE NEW PRODUCTS ARE GREATER THAN WE HAVE

EXPERIENCED, GROSS MARGIN MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED. OUR GROSS MARGIN MAY ALSO

BE IMPACTED BY GEOGRAPHIC MIX, AS WELL AS THE MIX OF CONFIGURATIONS WITHIN EACH

PRODUCT GROUP. WE CONTINUE TO EXPAND INTO THIRD-PARTY OR INDIRECT-DISTRIBUTION

CHANNELS, WHICH GENERALLY RESULTS IN A LOWER GROSS MARGIN. IN ADDITION,

INCREASING THIRD-PARTY AND INDIRECT-DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS GENERALLY RESULTS IN

GREATER DIFFICULTY IN FORECASTING THE MIX OF OUR PRODUCT, AND TO A CERTAIN

DEGREE, THE TIMING OF ORDERS FROM OUR CUSTOMERS. DOWNWARD PRESSURES ON OUR GROSS

MARGIN MAY BE FURTHER IMPACTED BY OTHER FACTORS, SUCH AS INCREASED PERCENTAGE OF

REVENUE FROM SERVICE PROVIDER MARKETS, WHICH MAY HAVE LOWER MARGINS OR AN

INCREASE IN PRODUCT COSTS, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FUTURE OPERATING

RESULTS.

WE ALSO EXPECT THAT OUR OPERATING MARGIN MAY DECREASE AS WE CONTINUE TO HIRE

ADDITIONAL PERSONNEL AND EXPERIENCE INCREASES IN OVERALL OPERATING EXPENSES TO

SUPPORT OUR BUSINESS. WE PLAN OUR OPERATING EXPENSE LEVELS BASED PRIMARILY ON

FORECASTED REVENUE LEVELS. BECAUSE THESE EXPENSES ARE RELATIVELY FIXED IN THE

SHORT TERM, A SHORTFALL IN REVENUE COULD LEAD TO OPERATING RESULTS BEING BELOW

EXPECTATIONS.

WE ARE DEPENDENT UPON ADEQUATE COMPONENT SUPPLY AND MANUFACTURING CAPACITY

OUR GROWTH AND ABILITY TO MEET CUSTOMER DEMANDS ALSO DEPEND IN PART ON OUR

ABILITY TO OBTAIN TIMELY DELIVERIES OF PARTS FROM OUR SUPPLIERS. WE HAVE

EXPERIENCED COMPONENT SHORTAGES IN THE PAST THAT HAVE ADVERSELY AFFECTED OUR

OPERATIONS. ALTHOUGH WE WORK CLOSELY WITH OUR SUPPLIERS TO AVOID THESE TYPES OF

SHORTAGES, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL NOT ENCOUNTER THESE PROBLEMS

IN THE FUTURE. ALTHOUGH WE GENERALLY USE STANDARD PARTS

16

17

AND COMPONENTS FOR OUR PRODUCTS, CERTAIN COMPONENTS ARE PRESENTLY AVAILABLE ONLY

FROM A SINGLE SOURCE OR LIMITED SOURCES.

WHILE OUR SUPPLIERS HAVE PERFORMED EFFECTIVELY AND BEEN RELATIVELY FLEXIBLE TO

DATE, WE BELIEVE THAT WE WILL BE FACED WITH THE FOLLOWING CHALLENGES GOING

FORWARD.

-   NEW MARKETS THAT WE PARTICIPATE IN MAY GROW QUICKLY AND THUS, CONSUME

SIGNIFICANT COMPONENT CAPACITY;

-   AS WE CONTINUE TO ACQUIRE COMPANIES AND NEW TECHNOLOGIES, WE ARE DEPENDENT,

AT LEAST INITIALLY, ON UNFAMILIAR SUPPLY CHAINS OR RELATIVELY SMALL SUPPLY

PARTNERS;

-   WE FACE INCREASED COMPETITION FOR CERTAIN COMPONENTS, WHICH ARE CURRENTLY

SUPPLY CONSTRAINED, FROM EXISTING COMPETITORS AND COMPANIES IN OTHER

MARKETS.

MANUFACTURING CAPACITY AND COMPONENT SUPPLY CONSTRAINTS COULD BE SIGNIFICANT

ISSUES FOR US. FOR EXAMPLE, WE HAVE INCREASED OUR MANUFACTURING CAPACITY

SIGNIFICANTLY AND PLAN TO FURTHER INCREASE CAPACITY DURING THE COMING MONTHS. TO

MITIGATE THE COMPONENT SUPPLY CONSTRAINTS, WE HAVE STARTED TO BUILD INVENTORY

LEVELS. A REDUCTION OR INTERRUPTION IN SUPPLY OR A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN THE

PRICE OF ONE OR MORE COMPONENTS WOULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, OPERATING

RESULTS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION, PERHAPS MATERIALLY, AND COULD MATERIALLY DAMAGE

CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIPS.

WE COMPETE IN THE HIGHLY COMPETITIVE TELECOMMUNICATIONS EQUIPMENT MARKET

FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING OUR COMPETITION, SEE THE SECTION ENTITLED

"COMPETITION" CONTAINED IN ITEM 1 OF THIS REPORT.

WE EXPECT TO MAKE FUTURE ACQUISITIONS WHERE ADVISABLE AND ACQUISITIONS INVOLVE

NUMEROUS RISKS

THE NETWORKING BUSINESS IS HIGHLY COMPETITIVE, AND AS SUCH, OUR GROWTH IS

DEPENDENT UPON MARKET GROWTH, OUR ABILITY TO ENHANCE OUR EXISTING PRODUCTS AND

OUR ABILITY TO INTRODUCE NEW PRODUCTS ON A TIMELY BASIS. ONE OF THE WAYS WE HAVE

ADDRESSED AND WILL CONTINUE TO ADDRESS THE NEED TO DEVELOP NEW PRODUCTS IS

THROUGH ACQUISITIONS OF OTHER COMPANIES. ACQUISITIONS INVOLVE NUMEROUS RISKS,

INCLUDING THE FOLLOWING.

- DIFFICULTIES IN INTEGRATING THE OPERATIONS, TECHNOLOGIES, AND PRODUCTS OF THE

ACQUIRED COMPANIES;

17

18

-   THE RISK OF DIVERTING MANAGEMENT'S ATTENTION FROM NORMAL DAILY OPERATIONS OF

THE BUSINESS;

-   POTENTIAL DIFFICULTIES IN COMPLETING PROJECTS ASSOCIATED WITH IN-PROCESS

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT;

-   RISKS OF ENTERING MARKETS IN WHICH WE HAVE NO OR LIMITED DIRECT PRIOR

EXPERIENCE AND WHERE COMPETITORS IN SUCH MARKETS HAVE STRONGER MARKET

POSITIONS;

-   INITIAL DEPENDENCE ON UNFAMILIAR SUPPLY CHAINS OR RELATIVELY SMALL SUPPLY

PARTNERS;

-   INSUFFICIENT REVENUES TO OFFSET INCREASED EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH

ACQUISITIONS; AND

-   THE POTENTIAL LOSS OF KEY EMPLOYEES OF THE ACQUIRED COMPANIES.

MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS OF HIGH-TECHNOLOGY COMPANIES ARE INHERENTLY RISKY, AND

NO ASSURANCE CAN BE GIVEN THAT OUR PREVIOUS OR FUTURE ACQUISITIONS WILL BE

SUCCESSFUL AND WILL NOT MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, OPERATING

RESULTS, OR FINANCIAL CONDITION.

WE MUST ALSO MANAGE ANY GROWTH EFFECTIVELY. FAILURE TO MANAGE GROWTH EFFECTIVELY

AND SUCCESSFULLY INTEGRATE ACQUISITIONS WE MADE COULD HARM OUR BUSINESS AND

OPERATING RESULTS IN A MATERIAL WAY.

WE ARE EXPOSED TO FLUCTUATIONS IN THE EXCHANGE RATES OF FOREIGN CURRENCY

AS A GLOBAL CONCERN, WE FACE EXPOSURE TO ADVERSE MOVEMENTS IN FOREIGN CURRENCY

EXCHANGE RATES. THESE EXPOSURES MAY CHANGE OVER TIME AS BUSINESS PRACTICES

EVOLVE AND COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS.

HISTORICALLY, OUR PRIMARY EXPOSURES HAVE RELATED TO NONDOLLAR-DENOMINATED SALES

IN JAPAN, CANADA, AND AUSTRALIA AND NONDOLLAR-DENOMINATED OPERATING EXPENSES IN

EUROPE, LATIN AMERICA, AND ASIA WHERE WE SELL PRIMARILY IN U.S. DOLLARS.

ADDITIONALLY, WE HAVE CONTINUED TO SEE OUR EXPOSURES TO EMERGING MARKET

CURRENCIES, SUCH AS THE KOREAN WON, INCREASE BECAUSE OF OUR EXPANDING PRESENCE

IN THESE MARKETS AND THEIR EXTREME CURRENCY VOLATILITY. WE WILL CONTINUE TO

MONITOR OUR EXPOSURE AND MAY HEDGE AGAINST THESE OR ANY OTHER EMERGING MARKET

CURRENCIES AS NECESSARY.

THE INCREASING USE OF THE EURO AS A COMMON CURRENCY FOR MEMBERS OF THE EUROPEAN

UNION COULD IMPACT OUR FOREIGN EXCHANGE EXPOSURE. WE ARE CURRENTLY HEDGING

AGAINST FLUCTUATIONS WITH THE EURO AND WILL CONTINUE TO EVALUATE THE IMPACT OF

THE EURO ON OUR FUTURE FOREIGN EXCHANGE EXPOSURE AS WELL AS ON OUR INTERNAL

SYSTEMS. AT THE PRESENT TIME, WE HEDGE ONLY THOSE CURRENCY EXPOSURES ASSOCIATED

WITH CERTAIN ASSETS AND LIABILITIES DENOMINATED IN NONFUNCTIONAL CURRENCIES AND

PERIODICALLY WILL HEDGE ANTICIPATED FOREIGN CURRENCY CASH FLOWS. THE HEDGING

ACTIVITY UNDERTAKEN BY

18

19

US IS INTENDED TO OFFSET THE IMPACT OF CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS ON CERTAIN

NONFUNCTIONAL CURRENCY ASSETS AND LIABILITIES.

WE ARE EXPOSED TO THE CREDIT RISK OF SOME OF OUR CUSTOMERS AND TO CREDIT

EXPOSURES IN WEAKENED MARKETS

A SIGNIFICANT PROPORTION OF OUR SALES ARE DERIVED THROUGH OUR PARTNERS IN

TWO-TIER DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS. THESE CUSTOMERS ARE GENERALLY GIVEN PRIVILEGES

TO RETURN INVENTORY, RECEIVE CREDITS FOR CHANGES IN SELLING PRICES, AND

PARTICIPATE IN COOPERATIVE MARKETING PROGRAMS. WE MAINTAIN APPROPRIATE ACCRUALS

AND ALLOWANCES FOR SUCH EXPOSURES. HOWEVER, SUCH PARTNERS TEND TO HAVE ACCESS TO

MORE LIMITED FINANCIAL RESOURCES THAN OTHER RESELLERS AND END-USER CUSTOMERS AND

THEREFORE REPRESENT POTENTIAL SOURCES OF INCREASED CREDIT RISK. WE ARE

EXPERIENCING INCREASED DEMANDS FOR CUSTOMER FINANCING, INCLUDING LOAN FINANCING,

AND LEASING SOLUTIONS. WE EXPECT DEMANDS FOR CUSTOMER FINANCING TO CONTINUE. WE

BELIEVE IT IS A COMPETITIVE FACTOR IN OBTAINING BUSINESS, PARTICULARLY IN

SUPPLYING CUSTOMERS INVOLVED IN SIGNIFICANT INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS. OUR LOAN

FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS MAY INCLUDE NOT ONLY FINANCING THE ACQUISITION OF OUR

PRODUCTS BUT ALSO PROVIDING ADDITIONAL FUNDS FOR SOFT COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH

NETWORK INSTALLATION AND INTEGRATION OF OUR PRODUCTS AND FOR WORKING CAPITAL

PURPOSES. ALTHOUGH WE HAVE PROGRAMS IN PLACE TO MONITOR AND MITIGATE THE

ASSOCIATED RISK, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT SUCH PROGRAMS WILL BE EFFECTIVE

IN REDUCING OUR CREDIT RISK. WE ALSO CONTINUE TO MONITOR INCREASED CREDIT

EXPOSURES FROM WEAKENED FINANCIAL CONDITIONS IN CERTAIN GEOGRAPHICAL REGIONS,

AND THE IMPACT THAT SUCH CONDITIONS MAY HAVE ON THE WORLDWIDE ECONOMY. WE HAVE

EXPERIENCED LOSSES DUE TO CUSTOMERS FAILING TO MEET THEIR OBLIGATIONS. ALTHOUGH

THESE LOSSES HAVE NOT BEEN SIGNIFICANT, FUTURE LOSSES, IF INCURRED, COULD HARM

OUR BUSINESS AND HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR OPERATING RESULTS AND

FINANCIAL CONDITION.

WE ARE EXPOSED TO FLUCTUATIONS IN THE MARKET VALUES OF OUR PORTFOLIO INVESTMENTS

AND IN INTEREST RATES

FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING THE SENSITIVITY OF AND RISKS ASSOCIATED

WITH THE MARKET VALUE OF PORTFOLIO INVESTMENTS AND INTEREST RATES, SEE ITEM 7A

"QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK" CONTAINED IN PART

II OF THIS REPORT.

WE CANNOT PREDICT THE IMPACT OF RECENT ACTIONS AND COMMENTS BY THE SEC AND FASB

RECENT ACTIONS AND COMMENTS FROM THE SEC HAVE INDICATED THEY ARE REVIEWING THE

CURRENT VALUATION METHODOLOGY OF IN-PROCESS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT RELATED TO

BUSINESS COMBINATIONS. THE SEC IS CONCERNED THAT SOME COMPANIES ARE WRITING OFF

MORE OF THE

19

20

VALUE OF AN ACQUISITION THAN IS APPROPRIATE. WE BELIEVE WE ARE IN COMPLIANCE

WITH ALL OF THE RULES AND RELATED GUIDANCE AS THEY CURRENTLY EXIST. HOWEVER,

THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THE SEC WILL NOT SEEK TO REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF

IN-PROCESS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT PREVIOUSLY EXPENSED BY US. THIS WOULD RESULT

IN THE RESTATEMENT OF OUR PREVIOUSLY FILED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND COULD HAVE A

MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR OPERATING RESULTS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION FOR

PERIODS SUBSEQUENT TO THE ACQUISITIONS. ADDITIONALLY, FASB HAS ANNOUNCED THAT IT

PLANS TO RESCIND THE POOLING OF INTERESTS METHOD OF ACQUISITION ACCOUNTING. IF

THIS OCCURS, IT COULD ALTER OUR ACQUISITION STRATEGY AND IMPAIR OUR ABILITY TO

ACQUIRE COMPANIES.

OUR BUSINESS DEPENDS UPON OUR PROPRIETARY RIGHTS, AND THERE IS A RISK OF

INFRINGEMENT

FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING OUR PROPRIETARY RIGHTS, SEE THE SECTION

ENTITLED "PATENTS, INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, AND LICENSING" CONTAINED IN ITEM 1 OF

THIS REPORT.

WE FACE RISKS FROM THE UNCERTAINTIES OF REGULATION OF THE INTERNET

THERE ARE CURRENTLY FEW LAWS OR REGULATIONS THAT APPLY DIRECTLY TO ACCESS OR

COMMERCE ON THE INTERNET. WE COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY

REGULATION OF THE INTERNET AND INTERNET COMMERCE IN ANY COUNTRY WHERE WE

OPERATE, ON SUCH TECHNOLOGY AS VOICE OVER THE INTERNET, ENCRYPTION TECHNOLOGY,

AND ACCESS CHARGES FOR INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDERS. WE ALSO COULD BE MATERIALLY

ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY THE CONTINUING DEREGULATION OF THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS

INDUSTRY. THE ADOPTION OF REGULATION OF THE INTERNET AND INTERNET COMMERCE COULD

DECREASE DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS, AND AT THE SAME TIME INCREASE OUR COST OF

SELLING OUR PRODUCTS, WHICH COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR

BUSINESS, OPERATING RESULTS, AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

THE ENTRANCE INTO NEW OR DEVELOPING MARKETS EXPOSES OUR BUSINESS AND OPERATIONS

TO RISKS

AS WE FOCUS ON NEW MARKET OPPORTUNITIES, SUCH AS TRANSPORTING DATA, VOICE, AND

VIDEO TRAFFIC ACROSS THE SAME NETWORK, WE WILL INCREASINGLY COMPETE WITH LARGE

TELECOMMUNICATIONS EQUIPMENT SUPPLIERS SUCH AS ALCATEL, ERICSSON, LUCENT,

NORTEL, AND SIEMENS AG, AMONG OTHERS, AND SEVERAL WELL-FUNDED START-UP

COMPANIES. SEVERAL OF OUR CURRENT AND POTENTIAL COMPETITORS HAVE GREATER

FINANCIAL, MARKETING, AND TECHNICAL RESOURCES THAN WE DO. ADDITIONALLY, AS

CUSTOMERS IN THESE MARKETS COMPLETE INFRASTRUCTURE DEPLOYMENTS, THEY MAY REQUIRE

GREATER LEVELS OF SERVICE, SUPPORT, AND FINANCING THAN WE HAVE EXPERIENCED IN

THE PAST. WE HAVE NOT ENTERED INTO A MATERIAL AMOUNT OF LABOR INTENSIVE SERVICE

CONTRACTS WHICH REQUIRE SIGNIFICANT PRODUCTION

20

21

OR CUSTOMIZATION. HOWEVER, WE EXPECT THAT DEMAND FOR THESE TYPES OF SERVICE

CONTRACTS WILL INCREASE IN THE FUTURE. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT WE CAN

PROVIDE PRODUCTS, SERVICE, SUPPORT, AND FINANCING TO EFFECTIVELY COMPETE FOR

THESE MARKET OPPORTUNITIES. FURTHER, PROVISION OF GREATER LEVELS OF SERVICES BY

US MAY RESULT IN LESS FAVORABLE TIMING OF REVENUE RECOGNITION THAN WE HAVE

HISTORICALLY EXPERIENCED.

THE LOCATION OF OUR FACILITIES SUBJECTS US TO THE RISK OF EARTHQUAKES AND FLOODS

OUR CORPORATE HEADQUARTERS, INCLUDING MOST OF OUR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

OPERATIONS AND OUR MANUFACTURING FACILITIES, ARE LOCATED IN THE SILICON VALLEY

AREA OF NORTHERN CALIFORNIA, A REGION KNOWN FOR SEISMIC ACTIVITY. ADDITIONALLY,

CERTAIN OF OUR FACILITIES, WHICH INCLUDES ONE OF OUR MANUFACTURING FACILITIES,

ARE LOCATED NEAR RIVERS THAT HAVE EXPERIENCED FLOODING IN THE PAST. A

SIGNIFICANT NATURAL DISASTER, SUCH AS AN EARTHQUAKE OR A FLOOD, COULD HAVE A

MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR BUSINESS, OPERATING RESULTS, AND FINANCIAL

CONDITION.

WE DEPEND UPON THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW PRODUCTS AND ARE SUBJECT TO RAPID CHANGES

IN TECHNOLOGY AND THE MARKET

OUR OPERATING RESULTS WILL DEPEND TO A SIGNIFICANT EXTENT ON OUR ABILITY TO

REDUCE THE COSTS TO PRODUCE EXISTING PRODUCTS. IN PARTICULAR, WE BROADENED OUR

PRODUCT LINE BY INTRODUCING NETWORK ACCESS PRODUCTS. SALES OF THESE PRODUCTS,

WHICH ARE GENERALLY LOWER PRICED AND CARRY LOWER MARGINS THAN OUR CORE PRODUCTS,

HAVE INCREASED MORE RAPIDLY THAN SALES OF OUR CORE PRODUCTS. THE SUCCESS OF

THESE AND OTHER NEW PRODUCTS IS DEPENDENT ON SEVERAL FACTORS, INCLUDING PROPER

NEW PRODUCT DEFINITION, PRODUCT COST, TIMELY COMPLETION AND INTRODUCTION OF NEW

PRODUCTS, DIFFERENTIATION OF NEW PRODUCTS FROM THOSE OF OUR COMPETITORS, AND

MARKET ACCEPTANCE OF THESE PRODUCTS. THE MARKETS FOR OUR PRODUCTS ARE

CHARACTERIZED BY RAPIDLY CHANGING TECHNOLOGY, EVOLVING INDUSTRY STANDARDS,

FREQUENT NEW PRODUCT INTRODUCTIONS, AND EVOLVING METHODS OF BUILDING AND

OPERATING NETWORKS. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL SUCCESSFULLY IDENTIFY

NEW PRODUCT OPPORTUNITIES, DEVELOP AND BRING NEW PRODUCTS TO MARKET IN A TIMELY

MANNER, AND ACHIEVE MARKET ACCEPTANCE OF OUR PRODUCTS OR THAT PRODUCTS AND

TECHNOLOGIES DEVELOPED BY OTHERS WILL NOT RENDER OUR PRODUCTS OR TECHNOLOGIES

OBSOLETE OR NONCOMPETITIVE.

WE ARE SUBJECT TO RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH STRATEGIC ALLIANCES

WE HAVE INCREASED THE NUMBER OF OUR STRATEGIC ALLIANCES WITH LARGE AND COMPLEX

ORGANIZATIONS AND OUR ECOSYSTEM PARTNERS. THESE ARRANGEMENTS ARE GENERALLY

LIMITED TO SPECIFIC PROJECTS, THE GOAL OF WHICH IS GENERALLY TO FACILITATE

PRODUCT COMPATIBILITY AND ADOPTION OF INDUSTRY STANDARDS. IF SUCCESSFUL, THESE

21

22

RELATIONSHIPS WILL BE MUTUALLY BENEFICIAL AND RESULT IN INDUSTRY GROWTH.

HOWEVER, THESE ALLIANCES CARRY AN ELEMENT OF RISK BECAUSE, IN MOST CASES, WE

MUST COMPETE IN SOME BUSINESS AREAS WITH A COMPANY WITH WHICH WE HAVE STRATEGIC

ALLIANCES AND, AT THE SAME TIME, COOPERATE WITH SUCH COMPANY IN OTHER BUSINESS

AREAS. ALSO, IF THESE COMPANIES FAIL TO PERFORM OR IF THESE RELATIONSHIPS FAIL

TO MATERIALIZE AS EXPECTED, WE COULD SUFFER DELAYS IN PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT OR

OTHER OPERATIONAL DIFFICULTIES.

THE INDUSTRY IN WHICH WE COMPETE IS SUBJECT TO CONSOLIDATION

THERE HAS BEEN A TREND TOWARD INDUSTRY CONSOLIDATION FOR SEVERAL YEARS. WE

EXPECT THIS TREND TOWARD INDUSTRY CONSOLIDATION TO CONTINUE AS COMPANIES ATTEMPT

TO STRENGTHEN OR HOLD THEIR MARKET POSITIONS IN AN EVOLVING INDUSTRY. WE BELIEVE

THAT INDUSTRY CONSOLIDATION MAY PROVIDE STRONGER COMPETITORS THAT ARE BETTER

ABLE TO COMPETE AS SOLE-SOURCE VENDORS FOR CUSTOMERS. THIS COULD LEAD TO MORE

VARIABILITY IN OPERATING RESULTS AS WE COMPETE TO BE A SINGLE VENDOR SOLUTION

AND COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, OPERATING RESULTS, AND

FINANCIAL CONDITION.

SALES IN THE SERVICE PROVIDER MARKET ARE SUBJECT TO VARIATION

ALTHOUGH SALES TO THE SERVICE PROVIDER MARKET HAVE GROWN HISTORICALLY, THIS

MARKET IS CHARACTERIZED BY LARGE AND OFTEN SPORADIC PURCHASES. SALES ACTIVITY IN

THIS INDUSTRY DEPENDS UPON THE STAGE OF COMPLETION OF EXPANDING NETWORK

INFRASTRUCTURES, THE AVAILABILITY OF FUNDING, AND THE EXTENT THAT SERVICE

PROVIDERS ARE AFFECTED BY REGULATORY AND BUSINESS CONDITIONS IN THE COUNTRY OF

OPERATIONS. A DECLINE OR DELAY IN SALES ORDERS FROM THIS INDUSTRY COULD HAVE A

MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, OPERATING RESULTS, AND FINANCIAL

CONDITION.

WE FACE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH CHANGES IN TELECOMMUNICATIONS REGULATION AND

TARIFFS

CHANGES IN DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL TELECOMMUNICATIONS REQUIREMENTS COULD

AFFECT THE SALES OF OUR PRODUCTS. IN PARTICULAR, WE BELIEVE IT IS POSSIBLE THAT

THERE MAY BE SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN DOMESTIC TELECOMMUNICATIONS REGULATION IN

THE NEAR FUTURE THAT COULD SLOW THE EXPANSION OF THE SERVICE PROVIDERS' NETWORK

INFRASTRUCTURES AND MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, OPERATING RESULTS,

AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. FUTURE CHANGES IN TARIFFS BY REGULATORY AGENCIES OR

APPLICATION OF TARIFF REQUIREMENTS TO CURRENTLY UNTARIFFED SERVICES COULD AFFECT

THE SALES OF OUR PRODUCTS FOR CERTAIN CLASSES OF CUSTOMERS. ADDITIONALLY, IN THE

UNITED STATES, OUR PRODUCTS MUST COMPLY WITH VARIOUS FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS

COMMISSION REQUIREMENTS AND REGULATIONS. IN COUNTRIES OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED

STATES, OUR PRODUCTS MUST MEET VARIOUS REQUIREMENTS OF LOCAL TELECOMMUNICATIONS

AUTHORITIES. CHANGES IN TARIFFS OR FAILURE BY

22

23

US TO OBTAIN TIMELY APPROVAL OF PRODUCTS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON

OUR BUSINESS, OPERATING RESULTS, AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

OUR BUSINESS IS SUBJECT TO RISKS FROM INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS

WE CONDUCT BUSINESS GLOBALLY. ACCORDINGLY, OUR FUTURE RESULTS COULD BE

MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY A VARIETY OF UNCONTROLLABLE AND CHANGING

FACTORS INCLUDING, AMONG OTHERS, FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES; REGULATORY,

POLITICAL, OR ECONOMIC CONDITIONS IN A SPECIFIC COUNTRY OR REGION; TRADE

PROTECTION MEASURES AND OTHER REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS; SERVICE PROVIDER AND

GOVERNMENT SPENDING PATTERNS; AND NATURAL DISASTERS. ANY OR ALL OF THESE FACTORS

COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR FUTURE INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS.

OUR BUSINESS SUBSTANTIALLY DEPENDS UPON THE CONTINUED GROWTH OF THE INTERNET AND

INTERNET-BASED SYSTEMS

WE BELIEVE THAT THERE WILL BE PERFORMANCE PROBLEMS WITH INTERNET COMMUNICATIONS

IN THE FUTURE WHICH COULD RECEIVE A HIGH DEGREE OF PUBLICITY AND VISIBILITY. AS

WE ARE A LARGE SUPPLIER OF EQUIPMENT FOR THE INTERNET INFRASTRUCTURE, CUSTOMERS'

PERCEPTIONS OF OUR PRODUCTS AND THE MARKETPLACE'S PERCEPTION OF US AS A SUPPLIER

OF NETWORKING PRODUCTS MAY BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED, REGARDLESS OF

WHETHER OR NOT THESE PROBLEMS ARE DUE TO THE PERFORMANCE OF OUR PRODUCTS. SUCH

AN EVENT COULD ALSO RESULT IN A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE MARKET PRICE OF

OUR COMMON STOCK AND COULD MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, OPERATING

RESULTS, AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

OUR STOCK PRICE MAY BE VOLATILE

OUR COMMON STOCK HAS EXPERIENCED SUBSTANTIAL PRICE VOLATILITY, PARTICULARLY AS A

RESULT OF VARIATIONS BETWEEN OUR ACTUAL OR ANTICIPATED FINANCIAL RESULTS, THE

PUBLISHED EXPECTATIONS OF ANALYSTS, AND AS A RESULT OF ANNOUNCEMENTS BY OUR

COMPETITORS AND US. IN ADDITION, THE STOCK MARKET HAS EXPERIENCED EXTREME PRICE

AND VOLUME FLUCTUATIONS THAT HAVE AFFECTED THE MARKET PRICE OF MANY TECHNOLOGY

COMPANIES, IN PARTICULAR, AND THAT HAVE OFTEN BEEN UNRELATED TO THE OPERATING

PERFORMANCE OF THESE COMPANIES. THESE FACTORS, AS WELL AS GENERAL ECONOMIC AND

POLITICAL CONDITIONS, MAY MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE MARKET PRICE OF OUR

COMMON STOCK IN THE FUTURE. ADDITIONALLY, VOLATILITY OR A LACK OF POSITIVE

PERFORMANCE IN OUR STOCK PRICE MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO RETAIN KEY

EMPLOYEES, ALL OF WHOM HAVE BEEN GRANTED STOCK OPTIONS.

OTHER

PRICEWATERHOUSECOOPERS LLP ("PWC"), OUR INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS, HAS NOTIFIED US

THAT PWC IS ENGAGED IN DISCUSSIONS WITH THE SEC FOLLOWING AN INTERNAL REVIEW BY

PWC, PURSUANT TO AN ADMINISTRATIVE SETTLEMENT WITH THE SEC, OF PWC'S COMPLIANCE

WITH AUDITOR INDEPENDENCE GUIDELINES. PWC HAS ADVISED US THAT WE ARE ONE OF THE

COMPANIES AFFECTED BY SUCH DISCUSSIONS. WE ARE NOT INVOLVED IN THE DISCUSSIONS

BETWEEN THE SEC AND PWC AND CANNOT PREDICT THE RESULT OF THOSE DISCUSSIONS.

ITEM 2.  PROPERTIES

THE COMPANY'S PRINCIPAL CORPORATE OFFICES ARE LOCATED AT SITES IN ALVISO,

MILPITAS, AND SAN JOSE, CALIFORNIA. THE COMPANY'S MAIN HEADQUARTERS ARE SITUATED

IN SAN JOSE, CALIFORNIA. THERE ARE CURRENTLY 50 BUILDINGS LOCATED AT THESE

SITES, THREE OF WHICH ARE MANUFACTURING FACILITIES, AND THE COMPANY EXPECTS THAT

CONSTRUCTION AT ITS CURRENT SITES WILL CONTINUE THROUGH FISCAL 2001. THE COMPANY

HAS CERTAIN OTHER OPERATING LEASES FOR BUILDINGS, WHICH INCLUDE ADDITIONAL

MANUFACTURING FACILITIES, LOCATED AT VARIOUS SITES NEAR SAN JOSE, CALIFORNIA.

ADDITIONALLY, THE COMPANY LEASES LAND FOR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT AND

CUSTOMER-SUPPORT ACTIVITIES IN BOXBOROUGH, MASSACHUSETTS; SALEM, NEW

HAMPSHIRE; RICHARDSON, TEXAS; AND RESEARCH TRIANGLE PARK, NORTH CAROLINA.

THE COMPANY ALSO LEASES VARIOUS SMALL OFFICES THROUGHOUT THE UNITED STATES AND

THE COMPANY HAS NEVER PAID CASH DIVIDENDS ON ITS COMMON STOCK AND HAS NO PRESENT

PLANS TO DO SO. THERE WERE APPROXIMATELY 60,150 SHAREHOLDERS OF RECORD AT JULY

29, 2000.

DURING THE QUARTER ENDED JULY 29, 2000, THE COMPANY ISSUED AN AGGREGATE OF

APPROXIMATELY 10.4 MILLION SHARES OF ITS COMMON STOCK IN CONNECTION WITH THE

PURCHASE OF THE CAPITAL STOCK OF ATLANTECH TECHNOLOGIES, SIGHTPATH, INC., AND

PENTACOM, LTD. THE SHARES WERE ISSUED PURSUANT TO EXEMPTIONS BY REASON OF

SECTION 4(2) OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED (THE "SECURITIES

ACT"). THESE SALES WERE MADE WITHOUT GENERAL SOLICITATION OR ADVERTISING. EACH

PURCHASER WAS AN ACCREDITED INVESTOR OR A SOPHISTICATED INVESTOR WITH ACCESS TO

ALL RELEVANT INFORMATION NECESSARY. THE COMPANY HAS FILED REGISTRATION

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

CERTAIN STATEMENTS CONTAINED IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT, INCLUDING, WITHOUT

LIMITATION, STATEMENTS CONTAINING THE WORDS "BELIEVES," "ANTICIPATES,"

"ESTIMATES," "EXPECTS," "PROJECTIONS," AND WORDS OF SIMILAR IMPORT, CONSTITUTE

"FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS." YOU SHOULD NOT PLACE UNDUE RELIANCE ON THESE

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS. OUR ACTUAL RESULTS COULD DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM

THOSE ANTICIPATED IN THESE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS FOR MANY REASONS,

INCLUDING RISKS FACED BY US DESCRIBED IN THIS REPORT, INCLUDING THOSE SET FORTH

COMPARISON OF FISCAL 2000 AND FISCAL 1999

NET SALES IN FISCAL 2000 WERE $18.93 BILLION, COMPARED WITH $12.17 BILLION IN

FISCAL 1999, AN INCREASE OF 55.5%. THE INCREASE IN NET SALES WAS PRIMARILY A

RESULT OF INCREASED UNIT SALES OF SWITCH, ROUTER, AND ACCESS PRODUCTS; GROWTH IN

THE SALES OF ADD-ON BOARDS THAT PROVIDE INCREASED FUNCTIONALITY; OPTICAL

TRANSPORT PRODUCTS; AND MAINTENANCE, SERVICE, AND SUPPORT SALES (SEE NOTE 12 TO

THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS).

WE MANAGE OUR BUSINESS ON FOUR GEOGRAPHIC THEATERS: THE AMERICAS; EUROPE, THE

MIDDLE EAST, AND AFRICA ("EMEA"); ASIA PACIFIC; AND JAPAN. SUMMARIZED FINANCIAL

THE NET SALES AND STANDARD MARGINS BY GEOGRAPHIC THEATER DIFFER FROM THE AMOUNTS

RECOGNIZED UNDER GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES BECAUSE WE DO NOT

ALLOCATE CERTAIN SALES ADJUSTMENTS, PRODUCTION OVERHEAD, AND MANUFACTURING

VARIANCES AND OTHER RELATED COSTS TO THE THEATERS. SALES ADJUSTMENTS RELATE TO

REVENUE DEFERRALS AND RESERVES, CREDIT MEMOS, RETURNS, AND OTHER TIMING

DIFFERENCES.

STANDARD MARGINS INCREASED FOR ALL GEOGRAPHIC THEATERS AS COMPARED WITH FISCAL

1999. THE DECREASE IN THE OVERALL GROSS MARGIN WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO SHIFTS IN

PRODUCT MIX, INTRODUCTION OF NEW PRODUCTS, WHICH GENERALLY HAVE LOWER MARGINS

WHEN FIRST RELEASED, HIGHER PRODUCTION-RELATED COSTS, THE CONTINUED PRICING

PRESSURE SEEN FROM COMPETITORS IN CERTAIN PRODUCT AREAS, AND THE ABOVE-MENTIONED

SALES ADJUSTMENTS, WHICH WERE NOT INCLUDED IN THE STANDARD MARGINS.

WE EXPECT GROSS MARGIN MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY INCREASES IN MATERIAL OR

LABOR COSTS, HEIGHTENED PRICE COMPETITION, INCREASING LEVELS OF SERVICES, HIGHER

INVENTORY BALANCES, INTRODUCTION OF NEW PRODUCTS FOR NEW HIGH-GROWTH MARKETS,

AND CHANGES IN CHANNELS OF DISTRIBUTION OR IN THE MIX OF PRODUCTS SOLD. WE

BELIEVE GROSS MARGIN MAY ADDITIONALLY BE IMPACTED DUE TO CONSTRAINTS RELATING TO

CERTAIN COMPONENT SHORTAGES THAT CURRENTLY EXIST IN THE SUPPLY CHAIN. WE MAY

ALSO EXPERIENCE A LOWER GROSS MARGIN AS THE PRODUCT MIX FOR ACCESS AND OPTICAL

PRODUCT VOLUME GROWS.

WE HAVE RECENTLY INTRODUCED SEVERAL NEW PRODUCTS, WITH ADDITIONAL NEW PRODUCTS

SCHEDULED TO BE RELEASED IN THE FUTURE. INCREASE IN DEMAND WOULD RESULT IN

INCREASED MANUFACTURING CAPACITY, WHICH IN TURN WOULD RESULT IN HIGHER INVENTORY

BALANCES. IN ADDITION, OUR VENDOR BASE IS CAPACITY-CONSTRAINED, AND THIS COULD

RESULT IN INCREASED COST PRESSURE ON CERTAIN COMPONENTS. IF PRODUCT OR RELATED

WARRANTY COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THESE NEW PRODUCTS ARE GREATER THAN WE HAVE

EXPERIENCED, GROSS MARGIN MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED. OUR GROSS MARGIN MAY ALSO

BE IMPACTED BY GEOGRAPHIC MIX, AS WELL AS THE MIX OF CONFIGURATIONS WITHIN EACH

PRODUCT GROUP. WE CONTINUE TO EXPAND INTO THIRD-PARTY OR INDIRECT-DISTRIBUTION

CHANNELS, WHICH GENERALLY RESULTS IN A LOWER GROSS MARGIN. IN ADDITION,

INCREASING THIRD-PARTY AND INDIRECT-

30

31

DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS GENERALLY RESULTS IN GREATER DIFFICULTY IN FORECASTING THE

MIX OF OUR PRODUCT, AND TO A CERTAIN DEGREE, THE TIMING OF ORDERS FROM OUR

CUSTOMERS. DOWNWARD PRESSURES ON OUR GROSS MARGIN MAY BE FURTHER IMPACTED BY

OTHER FACTORS, SUCH AS INCREASED PERCENTAGE OF REVENUE FROM SERVICE PROVIDER

MARKETS, WHICH MAY HAVE LOWER MARGINS OR AN INCREASE IN PRODUCT COSTS, WHICH

COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FUTURE OPERATING RESULTS.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ("R&D;") EXPENSES IN FISCAL 2000 WERE $2.70 BILLION,

COMPARED WITH $1.66 BILLION IN FISCAL 1999, AN INCREASE OF 62.6%. R&D; EXPENSES,

AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES, INCREASED TO 14.3% IN FISCAL 2000, COMPARED WITH

13.7% IN FISCAL 1999. THE INCREASE REFLECTED OUR ONGOING R&D; EFFORTS IN A WIDE

VARIETY OF AREAS SUCH AS DATA, VOICE, AND VIDEO INTEGRATION, DIGITAL SUBSCRIBER

LINE ("DSL") TECHNOLOGIES, CABLE MODEM TECHNOLOGY, WIRELESS ACCESS, DIAL ACCESS,

ENTERPRISE SWITCHING, OPTICAL TRANSPORT, SECURITY, NETWORK MANAGEMENT, AND

HIGH-END ROUTING TECHNOLOGIES, AMONG OTHERS. A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THE

INCREASE WAS DUE TO THE ADDITION OF NEW PERSONNEL, PARTLY THROUGH ACQUISITIONS,

AS WELL AS HIGHER EXPENDITURES ON PROTOTYPES AND DEPRECIATION ON ADDITIONAL LAB

EQUIPMENT. WE ALSO CONTINUED TO PURCHASE TECHNOLOGY IN ORDER TO BRING A BROAD

RANGE OF PRODUCTS TO THE MARKET IN A TIMELY FASHION. IF WE BELIEVE THAT WE ARE

UNABLE TO ENTER A PARTICULAR MARKET IN A TIMELY MANNER WITH INTERNALLY DEVELOPED

PRODUCTS, WE MAY LICENSE TECHNOLOGY FROM OTHER BUSINESSES OR ACQUIRE BUSINESSES

AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO INTERNAL R&D.; ALL OF OUR R&D; COSTS ARE EXPENSED AS

INCURRED. WE CURRENTLY EXPECT THAT R&D; EXPENSES WILL CONTINUE TO INCREASE IN

ABSOLUTE DOLLARS AS WE CONTINUE TO INVEST IN TECHNOLOGY TO ADDRESS POTENTIAL

MARKET OPPORTUNITIES.

SALES AND MARKETING EXPENSES IN FISCAL 2000 WERE $3.95 BILLION, COMPARED WITH

$2.46 BILLION IN FISCAL 1999, AN INCREASE OF 60.1%. SALES AND MARKETING

EXPENSES, AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES, INCREASED TO 20.8% IN FISCAL 2000,

COMPARED WITH 20.2% IN FISCAL 1999. THE INCREASE WAS PRINCIPALLY DUE TO AN

INCREASE IN THE SIZE OF OUR DIRECT SALES FORCE AND RELATED COMMISSIONS,

ADDITIONAL MARKETING AND ADVERTISING INVESTMENTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE

INTRODUCTION OF NEW PRODUCTS, THE EXPANSION OF DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS, AND

GENERAL CORPORATE BRANDING. THE INCREASE ALSO REFLECTED OUR EFFORTS TO INVEST IN

CERTAIN KEY AREAS, SUCH AS EXPANSION OF OUR END-TO-END NETWORKING STRATEGY AND

SERVICE PROVIDER COVERAGE, IN ORDER TO BE POSITIONED TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF FUTURE

MARKET OPPORTUNITIES. WE CURRENTLY EXPECT THAT SALES AND MARKETING EXPENSES WILL

CONTINUE TO INCREASE IN ABSOLUTE DOLLARS.

GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE ("G&A;") EXPENSES IN FISCAL 2000 WERE $633 MILLION,

COMPARED WITH $381 MILLION IN FISCAL 1999, AN INCREASE OF 66.1%. G&A; EXPENSES,

AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES, INCREASED TO 3.3% IN FISCAL 2000, COMPARED WITH

3.1% IN FISCAL 1999. G&A; EXPENSES FOR FISCAL 2000 AND 1999 INCLUDED

ACQUISITION-

31

32

RELATED COSTS OF APPROXIMATELY $62 MILLION AND $16 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY.

EXCLUDING THE ACQUISITION-RELATED COSTS, THE INCREASE IN G&A; EXPENSES WAS

PRIMARILY RELATED TO THE ADDITION OF NEW PERSONNEL AND INVESTMENTS IN

INFRASTRUCTURE. WE INTEND TO KEEP G&A; EXPENSES RELATIVELY CONSTANT AS A

PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES; HOWEVER, THIS DEPENDS ON THE LEVEL OF ACQUISITION

ACTIVITY AND OUR GROWTH, AMONG OTHER FACTORS.

AMORTIZATION OF GOODWILL AND PURCHASED INTANGIBLE ASSETS INCLUDED IN OPERATING

EXPENSES WAS $291 MILLION IN FISCAL 2000, COMPARED WITH $61 MILLION IN FISCAL

1999. AMORTIZATION OF GOODWILL AND PURCHASED INTANGIBLE ASSETS PRIMARILY RELATES

TO VARIOUS PURCHASE ACQUISITIONS (SEE NOTE 3 AND NOTE 4 TO THE CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS). AMORTIZATION OF GOODWILL AND PURCHASED INTANGIBLE ASSETS

WILL CONTINUE TO INCREASE AS WE ACQUIRE COMPANIES AND TECHNOLOGIES.

THE AMOUNT EXPENSED TO IN-PROCESS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ("IN-PROCESS R&D;")

AROSE FROM THE PURCHASE ACQUISITIONS COMPLETED IN FISCAL 2000 (SEE NOTE 3 TO THE

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS).

THE FAIR VALUES OF THE EXISTING PRODUCTS AND PATENTS, AS WELL AS THE TECHNOLOGY

CURRENTLY UNDER DEVELOPMENT, WERE DETERMINED USING THE INCOME APPROACH, WHICH

DISCOUNTS EXPECTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS TO PRESENT VALUE. THE DISCOUNT RATES USED

IN THE PRESENT VALUE CALCULATIONS WERE TYPICALLY DERIVED FROM A WEIGHTED-AVERAGE

COST OF CAPITAL ANALYSIS AND VENTURE CAPITAL SURVEYS, ADJUSTED UPWARD TO REFLECT

ADDITIONAL RISKS INHERENT IN THE DEVELOPMENT LIFE CYCLE. THESE RISK FACTORS HAVE

INCREASED THE OVERALL DISCOUNT RATE FOR ACQUISITIONS IN THE CURRENT YEAR. WE

CONSIDER THE PRICING MODEL FOR PRODUCTS RELATED TO THESE ACQUISITIONS TO BE

STANDARD WITHIN THE HIGH-TECHNOLOGY COMMUNICATIONS EQUIPMENT INDUSTRY. HOWEVER,

WE DO NOT EXPECT TO ACHIEVE A MATERIAL AMOUNT OF EXPENSE REDUCTIONS OR SYNERGIES

AS A RESULT OF INTEGRATING THE ACQUIRED IN-PROCESS TECHNOLOGY. THEREFORE, THE

VALUATION ASSUMPTIONS DO NOT INCLUDE SIGNIFICANT ANTICIPATED COST SAVINGS.

THE DEVELOPMENT OF THESE TECHNOLOGIES REMAINS A SIGNIFICANT RISK DUE TO THE

REMAINING EFFORT TO ACHIEVE TECHNICAL VIABILITY, RAPIDLY CHANGING CUSTOMER

MARKETS, UNCERTAIN STANDARDS FOR NEW PRODUCTS, AND SIGNIFICANT COMPETITIVE

THREATS FROM NUMEROUS COMPANIES. THE NATURE OF THE EFFORTS TO DEVELOP THE

ACQUIRED TECHNOLOGIES INTO COMMERCIALLY VIABLE PRODUCTS CONSISTS PRINCIPALLY OF

PLANNING, DESIGNING, AND TESTING ACTIVITIES NECESSARY TO DETERMINE THAT THE

PRODUCTS CAN MEET MARKET EXPECTATIONS, INCLUDING FUNCTIONALITY AND TECHNICAL

REQUIREMENTS. FAILURE TO BRING THESE PRODUCTS TO MARKET IN A TIMELY MANNER COULD

RESULT IN A LOSS OF MARKET SHARE OR A LOST OPPORTUNITY TO CAPITALIZE ON EMERGING

MARKETS AND COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR BUSINESS AND OPERATING

RESULTS.

REGARDING OUR PURCHASE ACQUISITIONS COMPLETED IN FISCAL 2000 AND 1999, ACTUAL

RESULTS TO DATE HAVE BEEN CONSISTENT, IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS, WITH OUR

ASSUMPTIONS AT THE TIME OF THE ACQUISITIONS. THE ASSUMPTIONS PRIMARILY CONSIST

OF AN EXPECTED COMPLETION DATE FOR THE IN-PROCESS PROJECTS, ESTIMATED COSTS TO

COMPLETE THE PROJECTS, AND REVENUE AND EXPENSE PROJECTIONS ONCE THE PRODUCTS

HAVE ENTERED THE MARKET. SHIPMENT VOLUMES OF PRODUCTS FROM THE ABOVE-ACQUIRED

TECHNOLOGIES ARE NOT MATERIAL TO OUR OVERALL FINANCIAL RESULTS AT THE PRESENT

TIME. THEREFORE, IT IS DIFFICULT TO DETERMINE THE ACCURACY OF OVERALL REVENUE

PROJECTIONS EARLY IN THE TECHNOLOGY OR PRODUCT LIFE CYCLE. FAILURE TO ACHIEVE

THE EXPECTED LEVELS OF REVENUE AND NET INCOME FROM THESE PRODUCTS WILL

NEGATIVELY IMPACT THE RETURN ON INVESTMENT EXPECTED AT THE TIME THAT THE

ACQUISITIONS WERE COMPLETED AND POTENTIALLY RESULT IN IMPAIRMENT OF ANY OTHER

ASSETS RELATED TO THE DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES.

INTEREST AND OTHER INCOME, NET, WAS $577 MILLION IN FISCAL 2000, COMPARED WITH

$330 MILLION IN FISCAL 1999. THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO INTEREST INCOME

RELATED TO THE GENERAL INCREASE IN CASH AND INVESTMENTS, WHICH WAS GENERATED

FROM OUR OPERATIONS. NET GAINS REALIZED ON MINORITY INVESTMENTS WERE $531

MILLION IN

33

34

FISCAL 2000. THE NET GAINS REALIZED ON MINORITY INVESTMENTS WERE NOT MATERIAL IN

FISCAL 1999.

OUR PRO FORMA EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR FISCAL 2000 WAS 30.0%. THE ACTUAL EFFECTIVE

TAX RATE WAS 38.6%, WHICH INCLUDED THE IMPACT OF NONDEDUCTIBLE IN-PROCESS R&D;

AND ACQUISITION-RELATED COSTS. OUR FUTURE EFFECTIVE TAX RATES COULD BE ADVERSELY

AFFECTED IF EARNINGS ARE LOWER THAN ANTICIPATED IN COUNTRIES WHERE WE HAVE LOWER

EFFECTIVE RATES OR BY UNFAVORABLE CHANGES IN TAX LAWS AND REGULATIONS.

ADDITIONALLY, WE HAVE PROVIDED A VALUATION ALLOWANCE ON CERTAIN OF OUR DEFERRED

TAX ASSETS BECAUSE OF UNCERTAINTY REGARDING THEIR REALIZABILITY DUE TO

EXPECTATION OF FUTURE EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTION EXERCISES (SEE NOTE 11 TO THE

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS).

COMPARISON OF FISCAL 1999 AND FISCAL 1998

NET SALES IN FISCAL 1999 WERE $12.17 BILLION, COMPARED WITH $8.49 BILLION IN

FISCAL 1998, AN INCREASE OF 43.4%. THE INCREASE IN NET SALES WAS PRIMARILY A

RESULT OF INCREASED UNIT SALES OF LAN SWITCHING PRODUCTS, ACCESS SERVERS,

HIGH-PERFORMANCE WAN SWITCHING AND ROUTING PRODUCTS, AND MAINTENANCE SERVICE

CONTRACTS.

GROSS MARGIN IN FISCAL 1999 WAS 65.0%, COMPARED WITH 65.6% IN FISCAL 1998. THE

DECREASE IN THE OVERALL GROSS MARGIN WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO OUR CONTINUED SHIFT IN

REVENUE MIX TOWARD OUR LOWER-MARGIN PRODUCTS AND THE CONTINUED PRICING PRESSURE

SEEN FROM COMPETITORS IN CERTAIN PRODUCT AREAS.

R&D; EXPENSES IN FISCAL 1999 WERE $1.66 BILLION, COMPARED WITH $1.05 BILLION IN

FISCAL 1998, AN INCREASE OF 58.1%. R&D; EXPENSES, AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES,

INCREASED TO 13.7% IN FISCAL 1999, COMPARED WITH 12.4% IN FISCAL 1998. THE

INCREASE REFLECTED OUR ONGOING R&D; EFFORTS IN A WIDE VARIETY OF AREAS SUCH AS

DATA, VOICE, AND VIDEO INTEGRATION, DSL TECHNOLOGIES, CABLE MODEM TECHNOLOGY,

WIRELESS ACCESS, DIAL ACCESS, ENTERPRISE SWITCHING, SECURITY, NETWORK

MANAGEMENT, AND HIGH-END ROUTING TECHNOLOGIES, AMONG OTHERS. A SIGNIFICANT

PORTION OF THE INCREASE WAS DUE TO THE ADDITION OF NEW PERSONNEL, PARTLY THROUGH

ACQUISITIONS, AS WELL AS HIGHER EXPENDITURES ON PROTOTYPES AND DEPRECIATION ON

ADDITIONAL LAB EQUIPMENT.

SALES AND MARKETING EXPENSES IN FISCAL 1999 WERE $2.46 BILLION, COMPARED WITH

$1.58 BILLION IN FISCAL 1998, AN INCREASE OF 56.1%. SALES AND MARKETING

EXPENSES, AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES, INCREASED TO 20.2% IN FISCAL 1999,

COMPARED WITH 18.6% IN FISCAL 1998. THE INCREASE WAS PRINCIPALLY DUE TO AN

INCREASE IN THE SIZE OF OUR DIRECT SALES FORCE AND RELATED COMMISSIONS,

TELEVISION ADVERTISING CAMPAIGNS TO BUILD BRAND AWARENESS, ADDITIONAL MARKETING

AND ADVERTISING COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE INTRODUCTION

34

35

OF NEW PRODUCTS, AND THE EXPANSION OF DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS. THE INCREASE ALSO

REFLECTED OUR EFFORTS TO INVEST IN CERTAIN KEY AREAS, SUCH AS EXPANSION OF OUR

END-TO-END NETWORKING STRATEGY AND SERVICE PROVIDER COVERAGE, IN ORDER TO BE

POSITIONED TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF FUTURE MARKET OPPORTUNITIES.

G&A; EXPENSES IN FISCAL 1999 WERE $381 MILLION, COMPARED WITH $247 MILLION IN

FISCAL 1998, AN INCREASE OF 54.3%. G&A; EXPENSES, AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES,

INCREASED TO 3.1% IN FISCAL 1999, COMPARED WITH 2.9% IN FISCAL 1998. THE

INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY RELATED TO ADDITIONAL PERSONNEL AND ACQUISITION-RELATED

COSTS OF $16 MILLION.

AMORTIZATION OF GOODWILL AND PURCHASED INTANGIBLE ASSETS INCLUDED IN OPERATING

EXPENSES WAS $61 MILLION IN FISCAL 1999, COMPARED WITH $23 MILLION IN FISCAL

1998. AMORTIZATION OF GOODWILL AND PURCHASED INTANGIBLE ASSETS INCREASED AS WE

ACQUIRED COMPANIES AND TECHNOLOGIES.

INTEREST AND OTHER INCOME, NET, IN FISCAL 1999 WAS $330 MILLION, COMPARED WITH

$196 MILLION IN FISCAL 1998. INTEREST INCOME ROSE PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF

ADDITIONAL INVESTMENT INCOME ON OUR INCREASED INVESTMENT BALANCES.

RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

IN JUNE 1998, THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD ("FASB") ISSUED STATEMENT

OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS NO. 133, "ACCOUNTING FOR DERIVATIVE

INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES" ("SFAS 133"). SFAS 133, AS AMENDED,

ESTABLISHES ACCOUNTING AND REPORTING STANDARDS FOR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND

HEDGING ACTIVITIES. IT REQUIRES AN ENTITY TO RECOGNIZE ALL DERIVATIVES AS EITHER

ASSETS OR LIABILITIES ON THE BALANCE SHEET AND MEASURE THOSE INSTRUMENTS AT FAIR

VALUE. WE DO NOT EXPECT THE INITIAL ADOPTION OF SFAS 133 TO HAVE A MATERIAL

EFFECT ON OUR OPERATIONS OR FINANCIAL POSITION. WE ARE REQUIRED TO ADOPT SFAS

133 IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL YEAR 2001.

IN SEPTEMBER 1999, THE FASB ISSUED EMERGING ISSUES TASK FORCE TOPIC NO. D-83,

"ACCOUNTING FOR PAYROLL TAXES ASSOCIATED WITH STOCK OPTION EXERCISES" ("EITF

D-83"). EITF D-83 REQUIRES THAT PAYROLL TAX PAID ON THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE

EXERCISE PRICE AND THE FAIR VALUE OF ACQUIRED STOCK IN ASSOCIATION WITH AN

EMPLOYEE'S EXERCISE OF STOCK OPTIONS BE RECORDED AS OPERATING EXPENSES. PAYROLL

TAX ON STOCK OPTION EXERCISES OF $51 MILLION WAS EXPENSED IN FISCAL 2000.

IN DECEMBER 1999, THE SEC ISSUED STAFF ACCOUNTING BULLETIN NO. 101, "REVENUE

RECOGNITION IN FINANCIAL STATEMENTS" ("SAB 101"). SAB 101, AS AMENDED,

SUMMARIZES CERTAIN OF THE SEC'S VIEWS IN APPLYING GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING

PRINCIPLES TO REVENUE

35

36

RECOGNITION IN FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. AT THIS TIME, WE DO NOT EXPECT THE ADOPTION

OF SAB 101 TO HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON OUR OPERATIONS OR FINANCIAL POSITION;

HOWEVER, THE SEC'S FINAL GUIDANCE FOR IMPLEMENTATION HAS NOT BEEN RELEASED TO

DATE. WE ARE REQUIRED TO ADOPT SAB 101 IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF FISCAL 2001.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS, SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS, AND INVESTMENTS WERE $20.50

BILLION AT JULY 29, 2000, AN INCREASE OF $10.28 BILLION FROM JULY 31, 1999. THE

INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY A RESULT OF $5.00 BILLION OF NET UNREALIZED GAINS ON

PUBLICLY HELD INVESTMENTS AND $7.70 BILLION OF CASH GENERATED BY OPERATING AND

FINANCING ACTIVITIES PARTIALLY OFFSET BY INVESTING ACTIVITIES, INCLUDING NET

CAPITAL EXPENDITURES OF $1.09 BILLION, PURCHASES OF TECHNOLOGY LICENSES OF $444

MILLION, AND INVESTMENTS IN LEASE RECEIVABLES OF $535 MILLION.

ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE INCREASED 83.9% DURING FISCAL 2000. DAYS SALES OUTSTANDING

IN RECEIVABLES INCREASED TO 37 DAYS FOR FISCAL 2000, FROM 32 DAYS FOR FISCAL

1999. THE INCREASE IN ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND DAYS SALES OUTSTANDING WAS DUE, IN

PART, TO GROWTH IN TOTAL NET SALES COMBINED WITH CONDITIONS IN A NUMBER OF

MARKETS, RESULTING IN LONGER PAYMENT TERMS.

INVENTORIES INCREASED 87.2% DURING FISCAL 2000; HOWEVER, INVENTORY TURNS

REMAINED CONSTANT AT 7.8 TIMES. THE INCREASE IN INVENTORY LEVELS REFLECTED NEW

PRODUCT INTRODUCTIONS, CONTINUED GROWTH IN OUR TWO-TIER DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM, AND

INCREASED PURCHASES TO SECURE THE SUPPLY OF CERTAIN COMPONENTS. INVENTORY

MANAGEMENT REMAINS AN AREA OF FOCUS AS WE BALANCE THE NEED TO MAINTAIN STRATEGIC

INVENTORY LEVELS TO ENSURE COMPETITIVE LEAD TIMES WITH THE RISK OF INVENTORY

OBSOLESCENCE DUE TO RAPIDLY CHANGING TECHNOLOGY AND CUSTOMER REQUIREMENTS.

AT JULY 29, 2000, WE HAD A LINE OF CREDIT TOTALING $500 MILLION, WHICH EXPIRES

IN JULY 2002. THERE HAVE BEEN NO BORROWINGS UNDER THIS AGREEMENT (SEE NOTE 7 TO

THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS).

WE HAVE ENTERED INTO SEVERAL AGREEMENTS TO LEASE 448 ACRES OF LAND LOCATED IN

SAN JOSE, CALIFORNIA, WHERE OUR HEADQUARTERS OPERATIONS ARE ESTABLISHED, AND 759

ACRES OF LAND LOCATED IN BOXBOROUGH, MASSACHUSETTS; SALEM, NEW HAMPSHIRE;

RICHARDSON, TEXAS; AND RESEARCH TRIANGLE PARK, NORTH CAROLINA, WHERE WE HAVE

EXPANDED CERTAIN R&D; AND CUSTOMER-SUPPORT ACTIVITIES. IN CONNECTION WITH THESE

TRANSACTIONS, WE HAVE PLEDGED $1.29 BILLION OF OUR INVESTMENTS AS COLLATERAL FOR

CERTAIN OBLIGATIONS OF THE LEASES. WE ANTICIPATE THAT WE WILL OCCUPY MORE LEASED

PROPERTY IN THE FUTURE THAT WILL REQUIRE SIMILAR PLEDGED SECURITIES; HOWEVER, WE

DO NOT EXPECT THE IMPACT OF THIS ACTIVITY TO BE MATERIAL TO

36

37

OUR LIQUIDITY POSITION (SEE NOTE 8 TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS).

WE BELIEVE THAT OUR CURRENT CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS, SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS,

LINE OF CREDIT, AND CASH GENERATED FROM OPERATIONS WILL SATISFY OUR EXPECTED

WORKING CAPITAL, CAPITAL EXPENDITURE, AND INVESTMENT REQUIREMENTS THROUGH AT

LEAST THE NEXT 12 MONTHS.

ITEM 7A.  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

WE MAINTAIN AN INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO OF VARIOUS HOLDINGS, TYPES, AND MATURITIES.

THESE SECURITIES ARE GENERALLY CLASSIFIED AS AVAILABLE FOR SALE AND,

CONSEQUENTLY, ARE RECORDED ON THE BALANCE SHEET AT FAIR VALUE WITH UNREALIZED

GAINS OR LOSSES REPORTED AS A SEPARATE COMPONENT OF ACCUMULATED OTHER

COMPREHENSIVE INCOME, NET OF TAX. PART OF THIS PORTFOLIO INCLUDES MINORITY

EQUITY INVESTMENTS IN SEVERAL PUBLICLY TRADED COMPANIES, THE VALUES OF WHICH ARE

SUBJECT TO MARKET PRICE VOLATILITY. FOR EXAMPLE, AS A RESULT OF RECENT MARKET

PRICE VOLATILITY OF OUR PUBLICLY TRADED EQUITY INVESTMENTS, WE EXPERIENCED A

$111 MILLION AFTER-TAX UNREALIZED LOSS DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2000

AND A $1.83 BILLION AFTER-TAX UNREALIZED GAIN DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF

FISCAL 2000 ON THESE INVESTMENTS. WE HAVE ALSO INVESTED IN NUMEROUS PRIVATELY

HELD COMPANIES, MANY OF WHICH CAN STILL BE CONSIDERED IN THE START-UP OR

DEVELOPMENT STAGES. THESE INVESTMENTS ARE INHERENTLY RISKY AS THE MARKET FOR THE

TECHNOLOGIES OR PRODUCTS THEY HAVE UNDER DEVELOPMENT ARE TYPICALLY IN THE EARLY

STAGES AND MAY NEVER MATERIALIZE. WE COULD LOSE OUR ENTIRE INITIAL INVESTMENT IN

THESE COMPANIES. WE ALSO HAVE CERTAIN REAL ESTATE LEASE COMMITMENTS WITH

PAYMENTS TIED TO SHORT-TERM INTEREST RATES. AT ANY TIME, A SHARP RISE IN

INTEREST RATES COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR

INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO WHILE INCREASING THE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR LEASE

COMMITMENTS. CONVERSELY, DECLINES IN INTEREST RATES COULD HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT

ON INTEREST EARNINGS FOR OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO. WE DO NOT CURRENTLY HEDGE

THESE INTEREST RATE EXPOSURES.

THE FOLLOWING TABLE PRESENTS THE HYPOTHETICAL CHANGES IN FAIR VALUES IN THE

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS HELD AT JULY 29, 2000 THAT ARE SENSITIVE TO CHANGES IN

INTEREST RATES. THESE INSTRUMENTS ARE NOT LEVERAGED AND ARE HELD FOR PURPOSES

OTHER THAN TRADING. THE MODELING TECHNIQUE USED MEASURES THE CHANGE IN FAIR

VALUES ARISING FROM SELECTED POTENTIAL CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES. MARKET CHANGES

MINUS 50 BASIS POINTS ("BPS"), 100 BPS, AND 150 BPS OVER A 12-MONTH HORIZON.

YEARS; A 100 BPS MOVE IN THE FEDERAL FUNDS RATE HAS OCCURRED IN SIX OF THE LAST

10 YEARS; AND A 150 BPS MOVE IN THE FEDERAL FUNDS RATE HAS OCCURRED IN FOUR OF

THE LAST 10 YEARS.

THE FOLLOWING ANALYSIS PRESENTS THE HYPOTHETICAL CHANGES IN FAIR VALUES OF

PUBLIC EQUITY INVESTMENTS THAT ARE SENSITIVE TO CHANGES IN THE STOCK MARKET.

THESE EQUITY SECURITIES ARE HELD FOR PURPOSES OTHER THAN TRADING. THE MODELING

TECHNIQUE USED MEASURES THE HYPOTHETICAL CHANGE IN FAIR VALUES ARISING FROM

SELECTED HYPOTHETICAL CHANGES IN EACH STOCK'S PRICE. STOCK PRICE FLUCTUATIONS OF

PLUS OR MINUS 15%, PLUS OR MINUS 35%, AND PLUS OR MINUS 50% WERE SELECTED BASED

ON THE PROBABILITY OF THEIR OCCURRENCE.

OUR EQUITY PORTFOLIO CONSISTS OF SECURITIES WITH CHARACTERISTICS THAT MOST

CLOSELY MATCH THE S&P; INDEX OR COMPANIES TRADED ON THE NASDAQ NATIONAL MARKET.

THE NASDAQ COMPOSITE INDEX HAS SHOWN A 15% MOVEMENT IN EACH OF THE LAST THREE

YEARS AND A 35% AND 50% MOVEMENT IN AT LEAST ONE OF THE LAST THREE YEARS.

WE ALSO HAVE AN INVESTMENT IN KPMG CONSULTING, INC. IN THE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF

$1.05 BILLION OF SERIES A MANDATORILY REDEEMABLE CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK,

WHICH CARRIES A 6% DIVIDEND RATE ON THE ORIGINAL ISSUE PRICE UNTIL CONVERTED TO

COMMON STOCK. CONVERSION IS AT OUR OPTION UPON OR AFTER THE COMPLETION OF AN

INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERING OF KPMG CONSULTING, INC. WE HAVE NOT INCLUDED THE

INVESTMENT IN THE ABOVE SENSITIVITY ANALYSES DUE TO THE NATURE OF THIS

INVESTMENT.

LEASES

WE ARE EXPOSED TO INTEREST RATE RISK ASSOCIATED WITH LEASES ON OUR FACILITIES

WHERE PAYMENTS ARE TIED TO THE LONDON INTERBANK OFFERED RATE ("LIBOR"). WE HAVE

EVALUATED THE HYPOTHETICAL CHANGE IN LEASE OBLIGATIONS HELD AT JULY 29, 2000 DUE

TO CHANGES IN THE LIBOR. THE MODELING TECHNIQUE USED MEASURES HYPOTHETICAL

CHANGES IN LEASE OBLIGATIONS ARISING FROM SELECTED HYPOTHETICAL CHANGES IN THE

LIBOR. THE HYPOTHETICAL MARKET CHANGES REFLECTED IMMEDIATE PARALLEL SHIFTS IN

THE LIBOR CURVE OF PLUS OR MINUS 50 BPS, 100 BPS, AND 150 BPS OVER A 12-MONTH

PERIOD. THE RESULTS OF THIS ANALYSIS WERE NOT MATERIAL IN COMPARISON TO OUR

FINANCIAL RESULTS.

FOREIGN EXCHANGE FORWARD AND OPTION CONTRACTS

WE ENTER INTO FOREIGN EXCHANGE FORWARD CONTRACTS TO OFFSET THE IMPACT OF

CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS ON CERTAIN NONFUNCTIONAL CURRENCY ASSETS AND LIABILITIES,

PRIMARILY DENOMINATED IN AUSTRALIAN, CANADIAN, JAPANESE, KOREAN, AND SEVERAL

EUROPEAN CURRENCIES, PRIMARILY THE EURO AND BRITISH POUND. WE ALSO PERIODICALLY

HEDGE ANTICIPATED TRANSACTIONS WITH PURCHASED CURRENCY OPTIONS.

THE FOREIGN EXCHANGE FORWARD AND OPTION CONTRACTS WE ENTER INTO GENERALLY HAVE

ORIGINAL MATURITIES RANGING FROM ONE TO THREE MONTHS. WE DO NOT ENTER INTO

FOREIGN EXCHANGE FORWARD AND OPTION CONTRACTS FOR TRADING PURPOSES. WE DO NOT

EXPECT GAINS OR LOSSES ON THESE CONTRACTS TO HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR

FINANCIAL RESULTS (SEE NOTE 8 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS).

2.   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

FISCAL YEAR THE COMPANY'S FISCAL YEAR IS THE 52 OR 53 WEEKS ENDING ON THE LAST

SATURDAY IN JULY. FISCAL 2000, 1999, AND 1998 WERE 52-WEEK, 53-WEEK, AND 52-WEEK

FISCAL YEARS, RESPECTIVELY.

PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDE THE

ACCOUNTS OF CISCO SYSTEMS, INC. AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES. ALL SIGNIFICANT

INTERCOMPANY ACCOUNTS AND TRANSACTIONS HAVE BEEN ELIMINATED.

CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS THE COMPANY CONSIDERS ALL HIGHLY LIQUID INVESTMENTS

PURCHASED WITH AN ORIGINAL OR REMAINING MATURITY OF LESS THAN THREE MONTHS AT

THE DATE OF PURCHASE TO BE CASH EQUIVALENTS. SUBSTANTIALLY ALL CASH AND CASH

EQUIVALENTS ARE CUSTODIED WITH THREE MAJOR FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS.

INVESTMENTS THE COMPANY'S INVESTMENTS COMPRISE U.S., STATE, AND MUNICIPAL

GOVERNMENT OBLIGATIONS; CORPORATE DEBT SECURITIES; AND PUBLIC CORPORATE EQUITY

SECURITIES. INVESTMENTS WITH MATURITIES OF LESS THAN ONE YEAR ARE CONSIDERED

SHORT-TERM AND ARE CARRIED AT FAIR VALUE. ALL INVESTMENTS ARE PRIMARILY HELD IN

THE COMPANY'S NAME AND CUSTODIED WITH TWO MAJOR FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. THE

SPECIFIC IDENTIFICATION METHOD IS USED TO DETERMINE THE COST OF SECURITIES

DISPOSED. AT JULY 29, 2000 AND JULY 31, 1999, SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE COMPANY'S

INVESTMENTS WERE CLASSIFIED AS AVAILABLE FOR SALE. UNREALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES

ON THESE INVESTMENTS ARE INCLUDED AS A SEPARATE COMPONENT OF SHAREHOLDERS'

EQUITY, NET OF ANY RELATED TAX EFFECT.

46

47

THE COMPANY ALSO HAS CERTAIN OTHER MINORITY INVESTMENTS IN NONPUBLICLY TRADED

COMPANIES. THESE INVESTMENTS ARE INCLUDED IN OTHER ASSETS ON THE COMPANY'S

BALANCE SHEET AND ARE GENERALLY CARRIED AT COST. THE COMPANY MONITORS THESE

INVESTMENTS FOR IMPAIRMENT AND MAKES APPROPRIATE REDUCTIONS IN CARRYING VALUES

WHEN NECESSARY.

INVENTORIES INVENTORIES ARE STATED AT THE LOWER OF COST OR MARKET. COST IS

COMPUTED USING STANDARD COST, WHICH APPROXIMATES ACTUAL COST ON A FIRST-IN,

FIRST-OUT BASIS.

RESTRICTED INVESTMENTS RESTRICTED INVESTMENTS CONSIST OF U.S. GOVERNMENT

OBLIGATIONS WITH MATURITIES OF MORE THAN ONE YEAR. THESE INVESTMENTS ARE CARRIED

AT FAIR VALUE AND ARE RESTRICTED AS TO WITHDRAWAL. RESTRICTED INVESTMENTS ARE

FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CARRYING AMOUNTS OF CERTAIN OF THE COMPANY'S

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, INCLUDING CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS, ACCRUED

COMPENSATION, AND OTHER ACCRUED LIABILITIES, APPROXIMATE FAIR VALUE BECAUSE OF

THEIR SHORT MATURITIES. THE FAIR VALUES OF INVESTMENTS ARE DETERMINED USING

QUOTED MARKET PRICES FOR THOSE SECURITIES OR SIMILAR FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS.

CONCENTRATIONS CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS ARE PRIMARILY MAINTAINED WITH THREE

MAJOR FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS IN THE UNITED STATES. DEPOSITS HELD WITH BANKS MAY

EXCEED THE AMOUNT OF INSURANCE PROVIDED ON SUCH DEPOSITS. GENERALLY, THESE

DEPOSITS MAY BE REDEEMED UPON DEMAND AND THEREFORE, BEAR MINIMAL RISK.

THE COMPANY PERFORMS ONGOING CREDIT EVALUATIONS OF ITS CUSTOMERS AND, WITH THE

EXCEPTION OF CERTAIN FINANCING TRANSACTIONS, DOES NOT REQUIRE COLLATERAL FROM

ITS CUSTOMERS.

THE COMPANY RECEIVES CERTAIN OF ITS COMPONENTS FROM SOLE SUPPLIERS.

ADDITIONALLY, THE COMPANY RELIES ON A LIMITED NUMBER OF HARDWARE MANUFACTURERS.

THE INABILITY OF ANY SUPPLIER OR MANUFACTURER TO FULFILL SUPPLY REQUIREMENTS OF

THE COMPANY COULD MATERIALLY IMPACT FUTURE OPERATING RESULTS.

REVENUE RECOGNITION THE COMPANY GENERALLY RECOGNIZES PRODUCT REVENUE WHEN

PERSUASIVE EVIDENCE OF AN ARRANGEMENT EXISTS, DELIVERY HAS OCCURRED, FEE IS

FIXED OR DETERMINABLE, AND COLLECTIBILITY IS PROBABLE. REVENUE FROM SERVICE

OBLIGATIONS IS DEFERRED AND GENERALLY RECOGNIZED RATABLY OVER THE PERIOD OF THE

OBLIGATION. THE COMPANY MAKES CERTAIN SALES TO PARTNERS IN TWO-TIER DISTRIBUTION

CHANNELS. THESE PARTNERS ARE GENERALLY GIVEN PRIVILEGES TO RETURN A PORTION OF

INVENTORY AND PARTICIPATE IN VARIOUS COOPERATIVE MARKETING PROGRAMS. THE COMPANY

RECOGNIZES

47

48

REVENUE TO TWO-TIER DISTRIBUTORS BASED ON ESTIMATES WHICH APPROXIMATE THE POINT

PRODUCTS HAVE BEEN SOLD BY THE DISTRIBUTORS AND ALSO MAINTAINS ACCRUALS AND

ALLOWANCES FOR ALL COOPERATIVE MARKETING AND OTHER PROGRAMS. THE COMPANY ACCRUES

FOR WARRANTY COSTS, SALES RETURNS, AND OTHER ALLOWANCES BASED ON ITS EXPERIENCE.

LEASE RECEIVABLES CISCO PROVIDES A VARIETY OF LEASE FINANCING SERVICES TO ITS

CUSTOMERS TO BUILD, MAINTAIN, AND UPGRADE THEIR NETWORKS. LEASE RECEIVABLES

REPRESENT THE PRINCIPAL BALANCE REMAINING IN SALES-TYPE AND DIRECT-FINANCING

LEASES UNDER THESE PROGRAMS. THESE LEASES TYPICALLY HAVE TWO TO THREE YEAR TERMS

AND ARE COLLATERALIZED BY A SECURITY INTEREST IN THE UNDERLYING ASSETS.

ADVERTISING COSTS THE COMPANY EXPENSES ALL ADVERTISING COSTS AS INCURRED.

SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT COSTS SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT COSTS, WHICH ARE REQUIRED TO BE

CAPITALIZED PURSUANT TO STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS NO. 86,

"ACCOUNTING FOR THE COSTS OF COMPUTER SOFTWARE TO BE SOLD, LEASED, OR OTHERWISE

MARKETED," HAVE NOT BEEN MATERIAL TO DATE.

DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT ARE STATED AT COST LESS

ACCUMULATED DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION. DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION IS

COMPUTED USING THE STRAIGHT-LINE METHOD OVER THE ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES OF THE

ASSETS. ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES OF 24 TO 30 MONTHS ARE USED ON COMPUTER EQUIPMENT

AND RELATED SOFTWARE AND PRODUCTION AND ENGINEERING EQUIPMENT AND FIVE YEARS FOR

OFFICE EQUIPMENT, FURNITURE, AND FIXTURES. DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION OF

LEASEHOLD IMPROVEMENTS IS COMPUTED USING THE SHORTER OF THE REMAINING LEASE TERM

OR FIVE YEARS.

GOODWILL AND PURCHASED INTANGIBLE ASSETS GOODWILL AND PURCHASED INTANGIBLE

ASSETS ARE CARRIED AT COST LESS ACCUMULATED AMORTIZATION. AMORTIZATION IS

COMPUTED USING THE STRAIGHT-LINE METHOD OVER THE ECONOMIC LIVES OF THE

RESPECTIVE ASSETS, GENERALLY THREE TO FIVE YEARS.

DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE RECOGNIZED FOR THE EXPECTED TAX

CONSEQUENCES OF TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE TAX BASES OF ASSETS AND

LIABILITIES AND THEIR REPORTED AMOUNTS.

48

49

COMPUTATION OF NET INCOME PER COMMON SHARE BASIC NET INCOME PER COMMON SHARE IS

COMPUTED USING THE WEIGHTED-AVERAGE NUMBER OF COMMON SHARES OUTSTANDING DURING

THE PERIOD. DILUTED NET INCOME PER COMMON SHARE IS COMPUTED USING THE

WEIGHTED-AVERAGE NUMBER OF COMMON AND DILUTIVE COMMON EQUIVALENT SHARES

OUTSTANDING DURING THE PERIOD. DILUTIVE COMMON EQUIVALENT SHARES CONSIST OF

STOCK OPTIONS. SHARE AND PER-COMMON SHARE DATA FOR ALL PERIODS PRESENTED REFLECT

THE TWO-FOR-ONE STOCK SPLIT EFFECTIVE MARCH 2000.

FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION ASSETS AND LIABILITIES OF NON-U.S. SUBSIDIARIES

THAT OPERATE IN A LOCAL CURRENCY ENVIRONMENT ARE TRANSLATED TO U.S. DOLLARS AT

EXCHANGE RATES IN EFFECT AT THE BALANCE SHEET DATE WITH THE RESULTING

TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENTS RECORDED DIRECTLY TO A SEPARATE COMPONENT OF

SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY. INCOME AND EXPENSE ACCOUNTS ARE TRANSLATED AT AVERAGE

EXCHANGE RATES DURING THE YEAR. WHERE THE U.S. DOLLAR IS THE FUNCTIONAL

CURRENCY, TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENTS ARE RECORDED IN INCOME.

DERIVATIVES THE COMPANY ENTERS INTO FOREIGN EXCHANGE FORWARD CONTRACTS TO

MINIMIZE THE SHORT-TERM IMPACT OF FOREIGN CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS ON ASSETS AND

LIABILITIES DENOMINATED IN CURRENCIES OTHER THAN THE FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY OF THE

REPORTING ENTITY. ALL FOREIGN EXCHANGE FORWARD CONTRACTS ARE HIGHLY INVERSELY

CORRELATED TO THE HEDGED ITEMS AND ARE DESIGNATED AS, AND CONSIDERED EFFECTIVE

AS, HEDGES OF THE UNDERLYING ASSETS OR LIABILITIES. GAINS AND LOSSES ON THE

CONTRACTS ARE INCLUDED IN INTEREST AND OTHER INCOME, NET, AND OFFSET FOREIGN

EXCHANGE GAINS OR LOSSES FROM THE REVALUATION OF INTERCOMPANY BALANCES OR OTHER

CURRENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES DENOMINATED IN CURRENCIES OTHER THAN THE

FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY OF THE REPORTING ENTITY. FAIR VALUES OF FOREIGN EXCHANGE

FORWARD CONTRACTS ARE DETERMINED USING PUBLISHED RATES. IF A DERIVATIVE CONTRACT

TERMINATES PRIOR TO MATURITY, THE INVESTMENT IS SHOWN AT ITS FAIR VALUE WITH THE

RESULTING GAIN OR LOSS REFLECTED IN INTEREST AND OTHER INCOME, NET. THE COMPANY

PERIODICALLY HEDGES ANTICIPATED TRANSACTIONS WITH PURCHASED CURRENCY OPTIONS.

THE PREMIUM PAID IS AMORTIZED OVER THE LIFE OF THE OPTION WHILE ANY INTRINSIC

VALUE IS RECOGNIZED IN INCOME DURING THE SAME PERIOD AS THE HEDGED TRANSACTION.

MINORITY INTEREST MINORITY INTEREST REPRESENTS THE PREFERRED STOCKHOLDERS'

PROPORTIONATE SHARE OF THE EQUITY OF CISCO SYSTEMS, K.K. (JAPAN). AT JULY 29,

2000, THE COMPANY OWNED ALL ISSUED AND OUTSTANDING COMMON STOCK AMOUNTING TO

73.2% OF THE VOTING RIGHTS. EACH SHARE OF PREFERRED STOCK IS CONVERTIBLE INTO

ONE SHARE OF COMMON STOCK AT ANY TIME AT THE OPTION OF THE HOLDER.

49

50

USE OF ESTIMATES THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND RELATED DISCLOSURES

IN CONFORMITY WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES

REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT THE AMOUNTS

REPORTED IN THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND ACCOMPANYING NOTES.

ESTIMATES ARE USED FOR, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE ACCOUNTING FOR THE ALLOWANCE FOR

DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS, INVENTORY ALLOWANCES, DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION, SALES

RETURNS, WARRANTY COSTS, TAXES, AND CONTINGENCIES.

ACTUAL RESULTS COULD DIFFER FROM THESE ESTIMATES.

IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS LONG-LIVED ASSETS AND CERTAIN IDENTIFIABLE

INTANGIBLE ASSETS TO BE HELD AND USED ARE REVIEWED FOR IMPAIRMENT WHENEVER

EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THAT THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF SUCH

ASSETS MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE. DETERMINATION OF RECOVERABILITY IS BASED ON AN

ESTIMATE OF UNDISCOUNTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS RESULTING FROM THE USE OF THE ASSET

AND ITS EVENTUAL DISPOSITION. MEASUREMENT OF AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS FOR LONG-LIVED

ASSETS AND CERTAIN IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS THAT MANAGEMENT EXPECTS TO

HOLD AND USE ARE BASED ON THE FAIR VALUE OF THE ASSET. LONG-LIVED ASSETS AND

CERTAIN IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS TO BE DISPOSED OF ARE REPORTED AT THE

LOWER OF CARRYING AMOUNT OR FAIR VALUE LESS COSTS TO SELL.

RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS IN JUNE 1998, THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING

STANDARDS BOARD ("FASB") ISSUED STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS NO.

133, "ACCOUNTING FOR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES" ("SFAS

133"). SFAS 133, AS AMENDED, ESTABLISHES ACCOUNTING AND REPORTING STANDARDS FOR

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES. IT REQUIRES AN ENTITY TO

RECOGNIZE ALL DERIVATIVES AS EITHER ASSETS OR LIABILITIES ON THE BALANCE SHEET

AND MEASURE THOSE INSTRUMENTS AT FAIR VALUE. MANAGEMENT DOES NOT EXPECT THE

INITIAL ADOPTION OF SFAS 133 TO HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE COMPANY'S

OPERATIONS OR FINANCIAL POSITION. THE COMPANY IS REQUIRED TO ADOPT SFAS 133 IN

THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2001.

IN SEPTEMBER 1999, THE FASB ISSUED EMERGING ISSUES TASK FORCE TOPIC NO. D-83,

"ACCOUNTING FOR PAYROLL TAXES ASSOCIATED WITH STOCK OPTION EXERCISES" ("EITF

D-83"). EITF D-83 REQUIRES THAT PAYROLL TAX PAID ON THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE

EXERCISE PRICE AND THE FAIR VALUE OF ACQUIRED STOCK IN ASSOCIATION WITH AN

EMPLOYEE'S EXERCISE OF STOCK OPTIONS BE RECORDED AS OPERATING EXPENSES. PAYROLL

TAX ON STOCK OPTION EXERCISES OF $51 MILLION WAS EXPENSED IN FISCAL 2000.

IN DECEMBER 1999, THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION ("SEC") ISSUED STAFF

ACCOUNTING BULLETIN NO. 101, "REVENUE RECOGNITION IN FINANCIAL STATEMENTS" ("SAB

101"). SAB 101, AS AMENDED, SUMMARIZES CERTAIN OF THE SEC'S VIEWS IN APPLYING

50

51

GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES TO REVENUE RECOGNITION IN FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS. AT THIS TIME, MANAGEMENT DOES NOT EXPECT THE ADOPTION OF SAB 101 TO

HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE COMPANY'S OPERATIONS OR FINANCIAL POSITION;

HOWEVER, THE SEC'S FINAL GUIDANCE FOR IMPLEMENTATION HAS NOT BEEN RELEASED TO

DATE. THE COMPANY IS REQUIRED TO ADOPT SAB 101 IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF FISCAL

2001.

RECLASSIFICATIONS CERTAIN RECLASSIFICATIONS HAVE BEEN MADE TO PRIOR YEAR

BALANCES IN ORDER TO CONFORM TO THE CURRENT YEAR PRESENTATION.

THE COMPANY'S FOREIGN EXCHANGE FORWARD AND OPTION CONTRACTS CONTAIN CREDIT RISK

TO THE EXTENT THAT ITS BANK COUNTERPARTIES MAY BE UNABLE TO MEET THE TERMS OF

THE AGREEMENTS. THE COMPANY MINIMIZES SUCH RISK BY LIMITING ITS COUNTERPARTIES

TO MAJOR FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. IN ADDITION, THE POTENTIAL RISK OF LOSS WITH

ANY ONE PARTY RESULTING FROM THIS TYPE OF CREDIT RISK IS MONITORED. MANAGEMENT

DOES NOT EXPECT ANY MATERIAL LOSSES AS A RESULT OF DEFAULT BY OTHER PARTIES.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

THE COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO LEGAL PROCEEDINGS, CLAIMS, AND LITIGATION ARISING IN

THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS. WHILE THE OUTCOME OF THESE MATTERS IS CURRENTLY

NOT DETERMINABLE, MANAGEMENT DOES NOT EXPECT THAT THE ULTIMATE COSTS TO RESOLVE

THESE MATTERS WILL HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANY'S CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL POSITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, OR CASH FLOWS.

AUTHORIZED SHARES

ON NOVEMBER 10, 1999, THE SHAREHOLDERS OF THE COMPANY APPROVED AN INCREASE TO

THE AUTHORIZED NUMBER OF SHARES OF COMMON STOCK FROM 5.40 BILLION TO 10 BILLION

A TWO-FOR-ONE BASIS FOR SHAREHOLDERS OF RECORD ON FEBRUARY 22, 2000 AND THE

RESULTING SHARES FROM THE SPLIT WERE DISTRIBUTED ON MARCH 22, 2000. ALL

REFERENCES TO SHARE AND PER-SHARE DATA FOR ALL PERIODS PRESENTED HAVE BEEN

ADJUSTED TO GIVE EFFECT TO THIS TWO-FOR-ONE STOCK SPLIT.

SHAREHOLDERS' RIGHTS PLAN

IN JUNE 1998, THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS APPROVED A SHAREHOLDERS' RIGHTS PLAN

THE EVENT OF AN UNSOLICITED TAKEOVER ATTEMPT. IT IS NOT INTENDED TO PREVENT A

TAKEOVER OF THE COMPANY ON TERMS THAT ARE FAVORABLE AND FAIR TO ALL SHAREHOLDERS

AND WILL NOT INTERFERE WITH A MERGER APPROVED BY THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS. EACH

RIGHT ENTITLES SHAREHOLDERS TO BUY A UNIT EQUAL TO A PORTION OF A NEW SHARE OF

SERIES A PREFERRED STOCK OF THE COMPANY. THE RIGHTS WILL BE EXERCISABLE ONLY IF

A PERSON OR A GROUP ACQUIRES OR ANNOUNCES A TENDER OR EXCHANGE OFFER TO ACQUIRE

15% OR MORE OF THE COMPANY'S COMMON STOCK.

IN THE EVENT THE RIGHTS BECOME EXERCISABLE, THE RIGHTS PLAN ALLOWS FOR CISCO

SHAREHOLDERS TO ACQUIRE, AT AN EXERCISE PRICE OF $108 PER RIGHT OWNED, STOCK OF

THE SURVIVING CORPORATION HAVING A MARKET VALUE OF $217, WHETHER OR NOT CISCO IS

THE SURVIVING CORPORATION. THE RIGHTS, WHICH EXPIRE IN JUNE 2008, ARE REDEEMABLE

FOR $0.00017 PER RIGHT AT THE APPROVAL OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS.

PREFERRED STOCK

UNDER THE TERMS OF THE COMPANY'S ARTICLES OF INCORPORATION, THE BOARD OF

DIRECTORS MAY DETERMINE THE RIGHTS, PREFERENCES, AND TERMS OF THE COMPANY'S

AUTHORIZED BUT UNISSUED SHARES OF PREFERRED STOCK.

10.     EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS

EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN

THE COMPANY HAS AN EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN (THE "PURCHASE PLAN") UNDER

WHICH 222 MILLION SHARES OF COMMON STOCK HAVE BEEN RESERVED FOR ISSUANCE.

ELIGIBLE EMPLOYEES MAY PURCHASE A LIMITED NUMBER OF SHARES OF THE COMPANY'S

COMMON STOCK AT 85% OF THE MARKET VALUE AT CERTAIN PLAN-DEFINED DATES. THE

PURCHASE PLAN TERMINATES ON JANUARY 3, 2005. IN FISCAL 2000, 1999, AND 1998,

SEVEN MILLION, 10 MILLION, AND 14 MILLION SHARES, RESPECTIVELY, WERE ISSUED

UNDER THE PURCHASE PLAN. AT JULY 29, 2000, 123 MILLION SHARES WERE AVAILABLE FOR

ISSUANCE UNDER THE PURCHASE PLAN.

EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTION PLANS

THE COMPANY HAS TWO MAIN STOCK OPTION PLANS: THE 1987 STOCK OPTION PLAN (THE

"PREDECESSOR PLAN") AND THE 1996 STOCK INCENTIVE PLAN (THE "1996 PLAN").

THE PREDECESSOR PLAN WAS TERMINATED IN 1996. ALL OUTSTANDING OPTIONS UNDER THE

PREDECESSOR PLAN WERE TRANSFERRED TO THE 1996 PLAN. HOWEVER, ALL OUTSTANDING

OPTIONS UNDER THE PREDECESSOR PLAN CONTINUE TO BE GOVERNED BY THE TERMS AND

CONDITIONS OF THE EXISTING OPTION AGREEMENTS FOR THOSE GRANTS.

THE MAXIMUM NUMBER OF SHARES UNDER THE 1996 PLAN WAS INITIALLY LIMITED TO THE

620 MILLION SHARES TRANSFERRED FROM THE PREDECESSOR PLAN. HOWEVER, UNDER THE

TERMS OF THE 1996 PLAN, THE SHARE RESERVE INCREASED EACH DECEMBER FOR THE THREE

FISCAL YEARS BEGINNING WITH FISCAL 1997, BY AN AMOUNT EQUAL TO 4.75% OF THE

OUTSTANDING SHARES ON THE LAST TRADING DAY OF THE IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING

NOVEMBER. IN FISCAL 1999, THE COMPANY'S SHAREHOLDERS

63

64

APPROVED THE EXTENSION OF THE AUTOMATIC SHARE INCREASE PROVISION OF THE 1996

PLAN FOR AN ADDITIONAL THREE-YEAR PERIOD.

ALTHOUGH THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS HAS THE AUTHORITY TO SET OTHER TERMS, THE

OPTIONS ARE GENERALLY 20% OR 25% EXERCISABLE ONE YEAR FROM THE DATE OF GRANT AND

THEN RATABLY OVER THE FOLLOWING 48 OR 36 MONTHS, RESPECTIVELY. OPTIONS ISSUED

UNDER THE PREDECESSOR PLAN GENERALLY HAD TERMS OF FOUR YEARS. NEW OPTIONS

GRANTED UNDER THE 1996 PLAN EXPIRE NO LATER THAN NINE YEARS FROM THE GRANT DATE.

=====             ====           ========

THE COMPANY HAS, IN CONNECTION WITH THE ACQUISITIONS OF VARIOUS COMPANIES,

ASSUMED THE STOCK OPTION PLANS OF EACH ACQUIRED COMPANY. DURING FISCAL 2000, A

TOTAL OF APPROXIMATELY 31 MILLION SHARES OF THE COMPANY'S COMMON STOCK HAVE BEEN

RESERVED FOR ISSUANCE UNDER THE ASSUMED PLANS AND THE RELATED OPTIONS ARE

INCLUDED IN THE PRECEDING TABLE.

IN 1997, THE COMPANY ADOPTED A SUPPLEMENTAL STOCK INCENTIVE PLAN (THE

"SUPPLEMENTAL PLAN") UNDER WHICH OPTIONS CAN BE GRANTED OR SHARES CAN BE

DIRECTLY ISSUED TO ELIGIBLE EMPLOYEES. OFFICERS AND MEMBERS OF THE COMPANY'S

BOARD OF DIRECTORS ARE NOT ELIGIBLE TO PARTICIPATE IN THE SUPPLEMENTAL PLAN.

NINE MILLION SHARES HAVE BEEN RESERVED FOR ISSUANCE UNDER THE SUPPLEMENTAL PLAN,

OF WHICH 9,000 SHARES ARE SUBJECT TO OUTSTANDING OPTIONS AND 66,600 SHARES HAVE

BEEN ISSUED IN FISCAL 2000.

FORMA INFORMATION REGARDING OPTION GRANTS MADE TO ITS EMPLOYEES BASED ON

SPECIFIED VALUATION TECHNIQUES THAT PRODUCE ESTIMATED COMPENSATION CHARGES.

THESE AMOUNTS HAVE NOT BEEN REFLECTED IN THE COMPANY'S CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS

OF OPERATIONS BECAUSE NO COMPENSATION CHARGE ARISES WHEN THE PRICE OF THE

EMPLOYEES' STOCK OPTIONS EQUALS THE MARKET VALUE OF THE UNDERLYING STOCK AT THE

THE BLACK-SCHOLES OPTION PRICING MODEL WAS DEVELOPED FOR USE IN ESTIMATING THE

FAIR VALUE OF TRADED OPTIONS THAT HAVE NO VESTING RESTRICTIONS AND ARE FULLY

TRANSFERABLE. IN ADDITION, OPTION PRICING MODELS REQUIRE THE INPUT OF HIGHLY

SUBJECTIVE ASSUMPTIONS INCLUDING THE EXPECTED STOCK PRICE VOLATILITY. THE

COMPANY USES PROJECTED VOLATILITY RATES WHICH ARE BASED UPON HISTORICAL

VOLATILITY RATES TRENDED INTO FUTURE YEARS. BECAUSE THE COMPANY'S EMPLOYEE STOCK

OPTIONS HAVE CHARACTERISTICS SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT FROM THOSE OF TRADED

OPTIONS, AND BECAUSE CHANGES IN THE SUBJECTIVE INPUT ASSUMPTIONS CAN MATERIALLY

AFFECT THE FAIR VALUE ESTIMATE, IN MANAGEMENT'S OPINION, THE EXISTING MODELS DO

NOT NECESSARILY PROVIDE A RELIABLE SINGLE MEASURE OF THE FAIR VALUE OF THE

COMPANY'S OPTIONS. THE WEIGHTED-AVERAGE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUES OF EMPLOYEE STOCK

OPTIONS GRANTED DURING FISCAL 2000, 1999, AND 1998 WERE $19.44, $8.40, AND $3.57

PER SHARE, RESPECTIVELY.

THE ABOVE PRO FORMA DISCLOSURES UNDER SFAS 123 ARE ALSO NOT LIKELY TO BE

REPRESENTATIVE OF THE EFFECTS ON NET INCOME AND NET INCOME PER COMMON SHARE IN

FUTURE YEARS, BECAUSE THEY DO NOT TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION PRO FORMA COMPENSATION

EXPENSE RELATED TO GRANTS MADE PRIOR TO FISCAL 1996.

EMPLOYEE 401(K) PLANS

THE COMPANY SPONSORS THE CISCO SYSTEMS, INC. 401(K) PLAN (THE "PLAN") TO PROVIDE

RETIREMENT BENEFITS FOR ITS EMPLOYEES. AS ALLOWED UNDER SECTION 401(K) OF THE

INTERNAL REVENUE CODE, THE PLAN PROVIDES TAX-DEFERRED SALARY DEDUCTIONS FOR

ELIGIBLE EMPLOYEES. THE COMPANY ALSO HAS OTHER 401(K) PLANS THAT IT SPONSORS.

THESE PLANS AROSE FROM ACQUISITIONS OF OTHER COMPANIES AND ARE NOT MATERIAL TO

THE COMPANY ON EITHER AN INDIVIDUAL OR AGGREGATE BASIS.

EMPLOYEES MAY CONTRIBUTE FROM 1% TO 15% OF THEIR ANNUAL COMPENSATION TO THE

PLAN, LIMITED TO A MAXIMUM ANNUAL AMOUNT AS SET PERIODICALLY BY THE INTERNAL

REVENUE SERVICE. THE COMPANY MATCHES EMPLOYEE CONTRIBUTIONS DOLLAR FOR DOLLAR UP

TO A MAXIMUM OF $1,500 PER YEAR PER PERSON. ALL MATCHING CONTRIBUTIONS VEST

IMMEDIATELY. IN ADDITION, THE PLAN PROVIDES FOR DISCRETIONARY CONTRIBUTIONS AS

DETERMINED BY THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS. SUCH CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE PLAN ARE

ALLOCATED AMONG ELIGIBLE PARTICIPANTS IN THE PROPORTION OF THEIR SALARIES TO THE

TOTAL SALARIES OF ALL PARTICIPANTS. THE COMPANY'S MATCHING CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE

PLAN TOTALED $34 MILLION, $20 MILLION, AND $15 MILLION IN FISCAL 2000, 1999, AND

1998, RESPECTIVELY. NO DISCRETIONARY CONTRIBUTIONS WERE MADE IN FISCAL 2000,

THE COMPANY HAS PROVIDED A VALUATION ALLOWANCE ON CERTAIN OF ITS DEFERRED TAX

ASSETS BECAUSE OF UNCERTAINTY REGARDING THEIR REALIZABILITY DUE TO EXPECTATION

OF FUTURE EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTION EXERCISES. DEFERRED TAX ASSETS OF APPROXIMATELY

$963 MILLION AT JULY 29, 2000 PERTAIN TO CERTAIN TAX CREDITS AND NET OPERATING

LOSS CARRYFORWARDS RESULTING FROM THE EXERCISE OF EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTIONS. WHEN

RECOGNIZED, THE TAX BENEFIT OF THESE CREDITS AND LOSSES WILL BE ACCOUNTED FOR AS

A CREDIT TO SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY RATHER THAN AS A REDUCTION OF THE INCOME TAX

PROVISION.

AS OF JULY 29, 2000, THE COMPANY'S FEDERAL AND STATE NET OPERATING LOSS

CARRYFORWARDS FOR INCOME TAX PURPOSES WERE APPROXIMATELY $496 MILLION AND $865

MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. IF NOT UTILIZED, THE FEDERAL NET OPERATING LOSS

CARRYFORWARDS WILL BEGIN TO EXPIRE IN FISCAL 2020, AND THE STATE NET OPERATING

LOSS CARRYFORWARDS WILL BEGIN TO EXPIRE IN FISCAL 2005. AS OF JULY 29, 2000, THE

COMPANY'S FEDERAL AND STATE TAX CREDIT CARRYFORWARDS FOR INCOME TAX PURPOSES

WERE APPROXIMATELY $678 MILLION AND $197 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. IF NOT UTILIZED,

THE FEDERAL AND STATE TAX CREDIT CARRYFORWARDS WILL BEGIN TO EXPIRE IN FISCAL

2005.

THE COMPANY'S INCOME TAXES PAYABLE FOR FEDERAL, STATE, AND FOREIGN PURPOSES HAVE

BEEN REDUCED, AND THE DEFERRED TAX ASSETS INCREASED, BY THE TAX BENEFITS

ASSOCIATED WITH DISPOSITIONS OF EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTIONS. THE COMPANY RECEIVES AN

INCOME TAX BENEFIT CALCULATED AS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE FAIR MARKET VALUE OF

THE STOCK ISSUED AT THE TIME OF EXERCISE AND THE OPTION PRICE, TAX EFFECTED.

THESE BENEFITS WERE CREDITED DIRECTLY TO SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY AND AMOUNTED TO

$3.08 BILLION, $837 MILLION, AND $422 MILLION FOR FISCAL 2000, 1999, AND 1998,

RESPECTIVELY. BENEFITS REDUCING TAXES PAYABLE AMOUNTED TO $2.49 BILLION, $837

MILLION, AND $422 MILLION FOR FISCAL 2000, 1999, AND 1998, RESPECTIVELY.

BENEFITS INCREASING GROSS DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AMOUNTED TO $582 MILLION IN FISCAL

12. SEGMENT INFORMATION AND MAJOR CUSTOMERS

THE COMPANY'S OPERATIONS INVOLVE THE DESIGN, DEVELOPMENT, MANUFACTURE,

MARKETING, AND TECHNICAL SUPPORT OF NETWORKING PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. THE

COMPANY OFFERS END-TO-END NETWORKING SOLUTIONS FOR ITS CUSTOMERS. CISCO PRODUCTS

INCLUDE ROUTERS, LAN AND ATM SWITCHES, DIAL-UP ACCESS SERVERS, AND

NETWORK-MANAGEMENT SOFTWARE. THESE PRODUCTS, INTEGRATED BY THE CISCO IOS(R)

SOFTWARE, LINK GEOGRAPHICALLY DISPERSED LANS, WANS, AND IBM NETWORKS.

THE COMPANY CONDUCTS BUSINESS GLOBALLY AND IS MANAGED GEOGRAPHICALLY. THE

COMPANY'S MANAGEMENT RELIES ON AN INTERNAL MANAGEMENT SYSTEM THAT PROVIDES SALES

AND STANDARD COST INFORMATION BY GEOGRAPHIC THEATER. SALES ARE ATTRIBUTED TO A

THEATER BASED ON THE ORDERING LOCATION OF THE CUSTOMER. THE COMPANY'S MANAGEMENT

MAKES FINANCIAL DECISIONS AND ALLOCATES RESOURCES BASED ON THE INFORMATION IT

RECEIVES FROM THIS INTERNAL MANAGEMENT SYSTEM. THE COMPANY DOES NOT ALLOCATE

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, SALES AND MARKETING, OR GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE

EXPENSES TO ITS GEOGRAPHIC THEATERS AS MANAGEMENT DOES NOT USE THIS INFORMATION

TO MEASURE THE PERFORMANCE OF THE OPERATING SEGMENTS. MANAGEMENT DOES NOT

BELIEVE THAT ALLOCATING THESE EXPENSES IS MATERIAL IN EVALUATING A GEOGRAPHIC

THEATER'S PERFORMANCE. INFORMATION FROM THIS INTERNAL MANAGEMENT SYSTEM DIFFERS

FROM THE AMOUNTS REPORTED UNDER GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES DUE TO

CERTAIN CORPORATE LEVEL ADJUSTMENTS NOT INCLUDED IN THE INTERNAL MANAGEMENT

SYSTEM. THESE CORPORATE LEVEL ADJUSTMENTS ARE PRIMARILY SALES ADJUSTMENTS

RELATING TO REVENUE DEFERRALS AND RESERVES, CREDIT MEMOS, RETURNS, AND OTHER

TIMING DIFFERENCES. BASED ON ESTABLISHED CRITERIA, THE COMPANY HAS FOUR

REPORTABLE SEGMENTS: THE AMERICAS; EUROPE, THE MIDDLE EAST, AND AFRICA ("EMEA");

ASIA PACIFIC; AND JAPAN.
