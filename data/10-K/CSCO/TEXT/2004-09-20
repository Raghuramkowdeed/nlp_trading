PRODUCTS AND SERVICES

WE SELL SCALABLE,

STANDARDS-BASED NETWORKING PRODUCTS THAT ADDRESS A WIDE RANGE OF CUSTOMERS BUSINESS NEEDS, INCLUDING IMPROVING PRODUCTIVITY, REDUCING COSTS, AND GAINING A COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE. OUR CORRESPONDING TECHNOLOGY FOCUS IS ON DELIVERING NETWORKING

PRODUCTS AND SYSTEMS THAT SIMPLIFY CUSTOMERS INFRASTRUCTURES, OFFER INTEGRATED SERVICES, AND ARE HIGHLY SECURE. OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES HELP CUSTOMERS BUILD THEIR OWN NETWORK INFRASTRUCTURES WHILE PROVIDING TOOLS TO ALLOW THEM TO COMMUNICATE

WITH KEY STAKEHOLDERS, INCLUDING CUSTOMERS, PROSPECTS, BUSINESS PARTNERS, SUPPLIERS, AND EMPLOYEES.

OUR PRODUCTS ARE USED INDIVIDUALLY OR IN COMBINATION TO CONNECT COMPUTING DEVICES TO NETWORKS OR COMPUTER NETWORKS WITH EACH OTHERWHETHER THEY ARE WITHIN A BUILDING, ACROSS A CAMPUS, OR AROUND THE WORLD. OUR

BREADTH OF PRODUCT AND SERVICE OFFERINGS ENABLES US TO OFFER A WIDE RANGE OF PRODUCTS AND SERVICES TO MEET CUSTOMER REQUIREMENTS. WE ALSO PROVIDE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES THAT ALLOW CUSTOMERS TO TRANSITION THEIR VARIOUS NETWORKS TO A SINGLE

MULTISERVICE DATA, VOICE, AND VIDEO NETWORK.

WE REFER TO SOME OF OUR PRODUCTS

BUSINESSES BUILDS UPON OUR EXISTING COMPETENCIES. WE HAVE CURRENTLY IDENTIFIED SIX ADVANCED TECHNOLOGIES FOR PARTICULAR FOCUS: HOME NETWORKING, IP TELEPHONY, OPTICAL NETWORKING, SECURITY, STORAGE AREA NETWORKING, AND WIRELESS TECHNOLOGY. WE MAY

IDENTIFY ADDITIONAL ADVANCED TECHNOLOGIES FOR FOCUS AND INVESTMENT IN THE FUTURE, AND OUR INVESTMENTS IN SOME PRESENTLY IDENTIFIED ADVANCED TECHNOLOGIES MAY BE CURTAILED OR ELIMINATED DEPENDING ON MARKET DEVELOPMENTS.

OVER TIME, WE BELIEVE THAT THE INTERNET AND THE VARIOUS NETWORKS ASSOCIATED WITH IT,

INCLUDING CORPORATE INTRANETS, CABLE, BROADBAND AND DIALUP NETWORKS, AND VOICE AND VIDEO NETWORKS, WILL EVOLVE TO INCLUDE EMBEDDED RESOURCES AND THE VIRTUALIZATION OF APPLICATIONS AND SERVICES TO PRODUCE AN INTEGRATED, INTELLIGENT SYSTEM OR, AS WE

REFER TO IT, AN INTELLIGENT INFORMATION NETWORK. THIS IS OUR VISION FOR THE

1

TABLE OF CONTENTS

EVOLUTION OF NETWORKING FROM CONNECTIVITY PRODUCTS TO INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS. IN THIS EVOLVING ENVIRONMENT, WE BELIEVE

SUCCESSFUL VENDORS WILL BE CAPABLE OF PROVIDING A BROAD SPECTRUM OF PRODUCTS AIMED NOT AT A PARTICULAR TECHNOLOGY PLATFORM BUT AT SOLUTIONS TO NETWORKING PROBLEMS THAT SPAN ALL SEGMENTS. AS SUCH, MANY OF OUR STRATEGIC INITIATIVES AND INVESTMENTS ARE

AIMED AT MEETING THE REQUIREMENTS THAT AN INTELLIGENT INFORMATION NETWORK WOULD DEMAND. FOR A DISCUSSION OF THE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THAT STRATEGY, PLEASE SEE THE SECTION OF THIS REPORT ENTITLED RISK FACTORS, INCLUDING THE RISK FACTOR

ENTITLED WE DEPEND UPON THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW PRODUCTS AND ENHANCEMENTS TO EXISTING PRODUCTS, AND IF WE FAIL TO PREDICT AND RESPOND TO EMERGING TECHNOLOGICAL TRENDS AND CUSTOMERS CHANGING NEEDS, OUR OPERATING RESULTS AND MARKET SHARE

MAY SUFFER. FOR INFORMATION REGARDING SALES OF OUR MAJOR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, SEE NOTE 12 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN OUR 2004 ANNUAL REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS, WHICH IS INCORPORATED INTO THIS REPORT BY REFERENCE.

BUSINESSES HAVING FEWER THAN 1,000 EMPLOYEES AND A NEED FOR NETWORKS OF THEIR OWN, AS WELL AS CONNECTION TO THE INTERNET AND TO BUSINESS PARTNERS. HOWEVER, THESE CUSTOMERS GENERALLY HAVE LIMITED RESOURCES AND EXPERTISE IN NETWORKING TECHNOLOGY.

THEREFORE, WE ATTEMPT TO PROVIDE PRODUCTS THAT ARE AFFORDABLE AND EASY TO INSTALL AND USE. THE COMMERCIAL MARKET REMAINS AN AREA OF POTENTIAL GROWTH FOR NETWORK ADOPTION AND DEPLOYMENT OF INTELLIGENT NETWORK SOLUTIONS.

CONSUMER

CONSUMER CUSTOMERS, PRIMARILY INDIVIDUALS AND SMALL OFFICE/HOME OFFICE (SOHO) BUSINESSES, HAVE INFRASTRUCTURE AND NETWORKING NEEDS ON A

SMALLER SCALE. WE OFFER PRODUCTS TO CONSUMERS THROUGH OUR LINKSYS DIVISION.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING CISCO SYSTEMS CAPITAL CORPORATIONS FINANCING ACTIVITIES, SEE NOTE 6 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN OUR 2004 ANNUAL REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS, WHICH IS INCORPORATED INTO THIS REPORT BY REFERENCE.

ACQUISITIONS, INVESTMENTS, AND ALLIANCES

THE

MARKETS IN WHICH WE COMPETE REQUIRE A WIDE VARIETY OF TECHNOLOGIES, PRODUCTS, AND CAPABILITIES. THE COMBINATION OF TECHNOLOGICAL

4

TABLE OF CONTENTS

COMPLEXITY AND RAPID CHANGE WITHIN OUR MARKETS MAKES IT DIFFICULT FOR A SINGLE COMPANY TO DEVELOP ALL TECHNOLOGICAL

SOLUTIONS THAT IT DESIRES TO OFFER WITHIN ITS FAMILY OF PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. THROUGH ACQUISITIONS, INVESTMENTS, AND ALLIANCES WE ARE ABLE TO DELIVER A BROADER RANGE OF PRODUCTS AND SERVICES TO CUSTOMERS IN TARGET MARKETS.

WE EMPLOY THE FOLLOWING STRATEGIES TO ADDRESS THE NEED FOR NEW OR ENHANCED NETWORKING

PRODUCTS AND SOLUTIONS: WE DEVELOP NEW TECHNOLOGIES AND PRODUCTS INTERNALLY; WE ENTER INTO JOINT-DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS WITH OTHER COMPANIES; WE RESELL OTHER COMPANIES PRODUCTS; AND WE ACQUIRE ALL OR PARTS OF OTHER COMPANIES.

ACQUISITIONS

WE HAVE ACQUIRED MANY COMPANIES, AND WE EXPECT TO MAKE FUTURE ACQUISITIONS. MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS OF HIGH-TECHNOLOGY COMPANIES ARE

INHERENTLY RISKY, ESPECIALLY IF THE ACQUIRED COMPANY HAS YET TO SHIP A PRODUCT. NO ASSURANCE CAN BE GIVEN THAT OUR PREVIOUS OR FUTURE ACQUISITIONS WILL BE SUCCESSFUL OR WILL NOT MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION OR OPERATING

RESULTS. PRIOR ACQUISITIONS HAVE RESULTED IN A WIDE RANGE OF OUTCOMES, FROM SUCCESSFUL INTRODUCTION OF NEW PRODUCTS AND TECHNOLOGIES TO AN INABILITY TO DO SO. THE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH ACQUISITIONS ARE MORE FULLY DISCUSSED IN THE SECTION OF THIS

REPORT ENTITLED RISK FACTORS, INCLUDING THE RISK FACTOR ENTITLED WE HAVE MADE AND EXPECT TO CONTINUE TO MAKE ACQUISITIONS THAT COULD DISRUPT OUR OPERATIONS AND HARM OUR OPERATING RESULTS.

INVESTMENTS IN PRIVATELY HELD COMPANIES

IN ADDITION TO PASSIVE PORTFOLIO INVESTMENTS, WE MAKE MINORITY INVESTMENTS IN PRIVATELY HELD

COMPANIES THAT DEVELOP TECHNOLOGY OR PROVIDE SERVICES THAT ARE COMPLEMENTARY TO OUR PRODUCTS OR PROVIDE STRATEGIC VALUE. THE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THESE INVESTMENTS ARE MORE FULLY DISCUSSED IN THE SECTION OF THE REPORT ENTITLED RISK

FACTORS, INCLUDING THE RISK FACTOR ENTITLED WE ARE EXPOSED TO FLUCTUATIONS IN THE MARKET VALUES OF OUR PORTFOLIO INVESTMENTS AND IN INTEREST RATES; IMPAIRMENT OF OUR INVESTMENTS COULD HARM OUR EARNINGS.

STRATEGIC ALLIANCES

WE PURSUE STRATEGIC ALLIANCES WITH OTHER COMPANIES IN AREAS WHERE COLLABORATION CAN PRODUCE INDUSTRY ADVANCEMENT AND ACCELERATION OF NEW

MARKETS. THE OBJECTIVES AND GOALS FOR A STRATEGIC ALLIANCE CAN INCLUDE ONE OR MORE OF THE FOLLOWING: TECHNOLOGY EXCHANGE, PRODUCT AND SOLUTION DEVELOPMENT, JOINT SALES AND MARKETING, OR NEW-MARKET CREATION. CURRENTLY, WE HAVE STRATEGIC ALLIANCES

WITH AT&T CORP.; BEARINGPOINT, INC.; BELL SOUTH CORPORATION; CAP GEMINI S.A.; ELECTRONIC DATA SYSTEMS CORPORATION; HEWLETT-PACKARD COMPANY; INTEL CORPORATION; INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS MACHINES CORPORATION; ITALTEL SPA; MICROSOFT CORPORATION;

MOTOROLA, INC.; SBC COMMUNICATIONS, INC.; AND SPRINT CORPORATION; AMONG OTHERS.

BACKLOG

OUR BACKLOG AT JULY 31, 2004, THE LAST

DAY OF OUR 2004 FISCAL YEAR, WAS APPROXIMATELY $1.9 BILLION, COMPARED WITH BACKLOG OF APPROXIMATELY $2.0 BILLION AT JULY 26, 2003, THE LAST DAY OF OUR 2003 FISCAL YEAR. BACKLOG INCLUDES ORDERS CONFIRMED WITH A PURCHASE ORDER FOR PRODUCTS SCHEDULED

TO BE SHIPPED WITHIN 90 DAYS TO CUSTOMERS WITH APPROVED CREDIT STATUS. BECAUSE OF THE GENERALLY SHORT CYCLE BETWEEN ORDER AND SHIPMENT AND OCCASIONAL CUSTOMER CHANGES IN DELIVERY SCHEDULES OR CANCELLATION OF ORDERS (WHICH ARE MADE WITHOUT

SIGNIFICANT PENALTY), WE DO NOT BELIEVE THAT OUR BACKLOG, AS OF ANY PARTICULAR DATE, IS NECESSARILY INDICATIVE OF ACTUAL NET SALES FOR ANY FUTURE PERIOD.

COMPETITION

WE COMPETE IN THE NETWORKING AND

COMMUNICATIONS EQUIPMENT MARKETS, PROVIDING PRODUCTS AND SERVICES FOR TRANSPORTING DATA, VOICE, AND VIDEO TRAFFIC ACROSS INTRANETS, EXTRANETS, AND THE INTERNET. THESE MARKETS ARE CHARACTERIZED BY RAPID CHANGE, CONVERGING TECHNOLOGIES, AND A

MIGRATION TO NETWORKING SOLUTIONS THAT OFFER SUPERIOR ADVANTAGES. THESE MARKET FACTORS REPRESENT BOTH AN OPPORTUNITY AND A COMPETITIVE THREAT TO US. WE COMPETE WITH NUMEROUS VENDORS IN EACH PRODUCT CATEGORY. THE OVERALL NUMBER OF OUR COMPETITORS

PROVIDING NICHE PRODUCT SOLUTIONS MAY INCREASE. ALSO, THE IDENTITY AND COMPOSITION OF COMPETITORS MAY CHANGE AS WE INCREASE OUR ACTIVITY IN OUR ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY MARKETS. AS WE CONTINUE TO EXPAND OUR SALES GLOBALLY, WE MAY SEE NEW COMPETITORS IN

DIFFERENT GEOGRAPHIC REGIONS, ESPECIALLY ASIA.

OUR COMPETITORS INCLUDE 3COM;

ALCATEL; AVAYA; AVICI SYSTEMS; BROCADE COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEMS, INC.; CHECK POINT SOFTWARE TECHNOLOGIES; CIENA; D-LINK SYSTEMS, INC.; DELL; ENTERASYS NETWORKS; EXTREME NETWORKS; FORCE10 NETWORKS, INC.; FOUNDRY NETWORKS; FUJITSU; HEWLETT-PACKARD

COMPANY; HUAWEI TECHNOLOGIES; JUNIPER NETWORKS; LUCENT; MCDATA CORPORATION; NETGEAR, INC.; NOKIA; NORTEL NETWORKS; REDBACK NETWORKS; SIEMENS AG; AND SYCAMORE NETWORKS; AMONG OTHERS.

SOME OF THESE COMPANIES COMPETE ACROSS MANY OF OUR PRODUCT LINES, WHILE OTHERS ARE PRIMARILY FOCUSED IN A SPECIFIC PRODUCT AREA.

5

TABLE OF CONTENTS

BARRIERS TO ENTRY ARE RELATIVELY LOW, AND NEW VENTURES TO CREATE PRODUCTS THAT DO OR COULD COMPETE WITH OUR PRODUCTS ARE

REGULARLY FORMED. IN ADDITION, SOME OF OUR COMPETITORS MAY HAVE GREATER RESOURCES, INCLUDING TECHNICAL AND ENGINEERING RESOURCES, THAN WE DO. AS WE EXPAND INTO NEW MARKETS, WE WILL FACE COMPETITION NOT ONLY FROM OUR EXISTING COMPETITORS BUT FROM

OTHER COMPETITORS, INCLUDING EXISTING COMPANIES WITH STRONG TECHNOLOGICAL, MARKETING, AND SALES POSITIONS IN THOSE MARKETS. WE ALSO SOMETIMES FACE COMPETITION FROM RESELLERS AND DISTRIBUTORS OF OUR PRODUCTS.

THE PRINCIPAL COMPETITIVE FACTORS IN THE MARKETS IN WHICH WE PRESENTLY COMPETE AND MAY

COMPETE IN THE FUTURE INCLUDE.



THE ABILITY TO PROVIDE A BROAD RANGE OF NETWORKING PRODUCTS AND SERVICES



PRODUCT PERFORMANCE



PRICE



THE ABILITY TO INTRODUCE NEW PRODUCTS WITH PRICE/PERFORMANCE ADVANTAGES



THE ABILITY TO PROVIDE VALUE-ADDED FEATURES SUCH AS SECURITY, RELIABILITY, AND INVESTMENT PROTECTION



CONFORMANCE TO STANDARDS



MARKET PRESENCE



THE ABILITY TO PROVIDE FINANCING

WE ALSO FACE COMPETITION FROM CUSTOMERS TO WHOM WE LICENSE OR SUPPLY TECHNOLOGY AND SUPPLIERS FROM WHOM WE TRANSFER TECHNOLOGY. THE INHERENT NATURE OF NETWORKING REQUIRES

INTEROPERABILITY. AS SUCH, WE MUST COOPERATE AND AT THE SAME TIME COMPETE WITH MANY COMPANIES. ANY INABILITY TO EFFECTIVELY MANAGE THESE COMPLICATED RELATIONSHIPS WITH CUSTOMERS AND SUPPLIERS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS,

OPERATING RESULTS, AND FINANCIAL CONDITION AND ACCORDINGLY AFFECT OUR CHANCES OF SUCCESS.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

WE REGULARLY SEEK TO

INTRODUCE NEW PRODUCTS AND FEATURES IN AREAS INCLUDING, ROUTERS, SWITCHES, ADVANCED TECHNOLOGIES, AND OTHER PRODUCT TECHNOLOGIES.

THE INDUSTRY IN WHICH WE COMPETE IS SUBJECT TO RAPID TECHNOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENTS, EVOLVING INDUSTRY STANDARDS, CHANGES IN CUSTOMER REQUIREMENTS, AND NEW PRODUCT

INTRODUCTIONS AND ENHANCEMENTS. AS A RESULT, OUR SUCCESS, IN PART, DEPENDS UPON OUR ABILITY, ON A COST-EFFECTIVE AND TIMELY BASIS, TO CONTINUE TO ENHANCE OUR EXISTING PRODUCTS AND TO DEVELOP AND INTRODUCE NEW PRODUCTS THAT IMPROVE PERFORMANCE AND

REDUCE TOTAL COST OF OWNERSHIP. IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE THESE OBJECTIVES, OUR MANAGEMENT AND ENGINEERING PERSONNEL WORK WITH CUSTOMERS TO IDENTIFY AND RESPOND TO CUSTOMER NEEDS, AS WELL AS WITH OTHER INNOVATORS OF INTERNETWORKING PRODUCTS, INCLUDING

UNIVERSITIES, LABORATORIES, AND CORPORATIONS. WE ALSO EXPECT TO CONTINUE TO MAKE ACQUISITIONS AND INVESTMENTS WHERE APPROPRIATE TO PROVIDE US WITH ACCESS TO NEW TECHNOLOGIES. WE INTEND TO CONTINUE DEVELOPING PRODUCTS THAT MEET KEY INDUSTRY STANDARDS

AND TO SUPPORT IMPORTANT PROTOCOL STANDARDS AS THEY EMERGE. STILL, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY DEVELOP PRODUCTS TO ADDRESS NEW CUSTOMER REQUIREMENTS AND TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGES OR THAT SUCH PRODUCTS WILL ACHIEVE

MARKET ACCEPTANCE.

OUR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENDITURES WERE $3.2

BILLION, $3.1 BILLION, AND $3.4 BILLION IN FISCAL 2004, 2003, AND 2002, RESPECTIVELY. ALL OF OUR EXPENDITURES FOR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS, AS WELL AS IN-PROCESS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT OF $3 MILLION, $4 MILLION, AND $65 MILLION IN FISCAL

2004, 2003, AND 2002, RESPECTIVELY, HAVE BEEN EXPENSED AS INCURRED.

MANUFACTURING

WE PRIMARILY EMPLOY AN OUTSOURCED

MANUFACTURING STRATEGY THAT RELIES ON CONTRACT MANUFACTURERS FOR MANUFACTURING SERVICES. OUR MANUFACTURING OPERATIONS PRIMARILY CONSIST OF QUALITY ASSURANCE OF MATERIALS AND COMPONENTS, SUBASSEMBLIES, FINAL ASSEMBLY, AND TESTING OF PRODUCTS. WE

PRESENTLY USE A VARIETY OF INDEPENDENT THIRD-PARTY COMPANIES TO PROVIDE SERVICES RELATED TO PRINTED CIRCUIT BOARD ASSEMBLY, IN-CIRCUIT TEST, AND PRODUCT REPAIR AS WELL AS PRODUCT ASSEMBLY. PROPRIETARY SOFTWARE ON ELECTRONICALLY PROGRAMMABLE MEMORY

CHIPS IS INSTALLED IN OUR SYSTEMS IN ORDER TO CONFIGURE PRODUCTS TO CUSTOMER NEEDS AND TO MAINTAIN QUALITY CONTROL AND SECURITY. THE MANUFACTURING PROCESS ENABLES US TO CONFIGURE THE HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE IN UNIQUE COMBINATIONS TO MEET A WIDE

VARIETY OF INDIVIDUAL CUSTOMER REQUIREMENTS. WE ALSO USE AUTOMATED TESTING EQUIPMENT AND BURN-IN PROCEDURES, AS WELL AS COMPREHENSIVE INSPECTION, TESTING, AND STATISTICAL PROCESS CONTROLS THAT ARE DESIGNED TO HELP ENSURE THE QUALITY AND RELIABILITY

OF OUR PRODUCTS. THE MANUFACTURING PROCESSES AND PROCEDURES ARE GENERALLY ISO 9001 OR ISO 9003 CERTIFIED.

OUR ARRANGEMENTS WITH CONTRACT MANUFACTURERS GENERALLY PROVIDE FOR QUALITY, COST, AND DELIVERY REQUIREMENTS, AS WELL AS

MANUFACTURING PROCESS TERMS, SUCH AS CONTINUITY OF SUPPLY, INVENTORY MANAGEMENT, FLEXIBILITY REGARDING CAPACITY, QUALITY AND COST MANAGEMENT, OVERSIGHT OF MANUFACTURING, AND CONDITIONS FOR USE OF OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY. WE HAVE NOT ENTERED INTO

ANY SIGNIFICANT LONG-TERM CONTRACTS WITH ANY MANUFACTURING SERVICE PROVIDER. WE GENERALLY HAVE THE OPTION TO RENEW ARRANGEMENTS ON AN AS-NEEDED BASIS, PRIMARILY ANNUALLY. THESE ARRANGEMENTS GENERALLY DO NOT COMMIT US TO PURCHASE ANY PARTICULAR

AMOUNT OR ANY QUANTITIES BEYOND CERTAIN AMOUNTS COVERED BY ORDERS OR FORECASTS THAT WE SUBMIT COVERING DISCRETE PERIODS OF TIME.

PATENTS, INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, AND LICENSING

WE SEEK TO ESTABLISH AND MAINTAIN OUR PROPRIETARY RIGHTS IN OUR TECHNOLOGY AND PRODUCTS THROUGH THE USE OF PATENTS, COPYRIGHTS, TRADEMARKS, AND TRADE SECRET LAWS. WE HAVE A PROGRAM TO FILE APPLICATIONS FOR AND OBTAIN PATENTS, COPYRIGHTS,

AND TRADEMARKS IN THE UNITED STATES AND IN SELECTED FOREIGN COUNTRIES WHERE WE BELIEVE FILING FOR SUCH PROTECTION IS APPROPRIATE. WE ALSO SEEK TO MAINTAIN OUR TRADE SECRETS AND CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION BY NONDISCLOSURE POLICIES AND THROUGH THE USE

OF APPROPRIATE CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENTS. WE HAVE OBTAINED A SUBSTANTIAL NUMBER OF PATENTS AND TRADEMARKS IN THE UNITED STATES AND IN OTHER COUNTRIES. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE, HOWEVER, THAT THE RIGHTS THEREBY OBTAINED CAN BE SUCCESSFULLY ENFORCED

AGAINST COMPETITIVE PRODUCTS IN EVERY JURISDICTION. ALTHOUGH WE BELIEVE THE PROTECTION AFFORDED BY OUR PATENTS, COPYRIGHTS, TRADEMARKS, AND TRADE SECRETS HAS VALUE, THE RAPIDLY CHANGING TECHNOLOGY IN THE NETWORKING INDUSTRY AND UNCERTAINTIES IN THE

LEGAL PROCESS MAKE OUR FUTURE SUCCESS DEPENDENT PRIMARILY ON THE INNOVATIVE SKILLS, TECHNOLOGICAL EXPERTISE, AND MANAGEMENT ABILITIES OF OUR EMPLOYEES RATHER THAN ON THE PROTECTION AFFORDED BY PATENT, COPYRIGHT, TRADEMARK, AND TRADE SECRET LAWS.

MANY OF OUR PRODUCTS ARE DESIGNED TO INCLUDE SOFTWARE OR OTHER INTELLECTUAL

PROPERTY LICENSED FROM THIRD PARTIES. WHILE IT MAY BE NECESSARY IN THE FUTURE TO SEEK OR RENEW LICENSES RELATING TO VARIOUS ASPECTS OF OUR PRODUCTS, WE BELIEVE, BASED UPON PAST EXPERIENCE AND STANDARD INDUSTRY PRACTICE, THAT SUCH LICENSES GENERALLY

COULD BE OBTAINED ON COMMERCIALLY REASONABLE TERMS. NONETHELESS, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THE NECESSARY LICENSES WOULD BE AVAILABLE ON ACCEPTABLE TERMS, IF AT ALL. OUR INABILITY TO OBTAIN CERTAIN LICENSES OR OTHER RIGHTS OR TO OBTAIN SUCH

LICENSES OR RIGHTS ON FAVORABLE TERMS, OR THE NEED TO ENGAGE IN LITIGATION REGARDING THESE MATTERS, COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, OPERATING RESULTS, AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. MOREOVER, INCLUSION IN OUR PRODUCTS OF SOFTWARE OR

OTHER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY LICENSED FROM THIRD PARTIES ON A NONEXCLUSIVE BASIS CAN LIMIT OUR ABILITY TO PROTECT OUR PROPRIETARY RIGHTS IN OUR PRODUCTS.

THE INDUSTRY IN WHICH WE COMPETE IS CHARACTERIZED BY RAPIDLY CHANGING TECHNOLOGY, A LARGE NUMBER OF PATENTS, AND FREQUENT CLAIMS AND RELATED LITIGATION REGARDING PATENT

AND OTHER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT OUR PATENTS AND OTHER PROPRIETARY RIGHTS WILL NOT BE CHALLENGED, INVALIDATED, OR CIRCUMVENTED; THAT OTHERS WILL NOT ASSERT INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS TO TECHNOLOGIES THAT ARE

RELEVANT TO US; OR THAT OUR RIGHTS WILL GIVE US A COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE. IN ADDITION, THE LAWS OF SOME FOREIGN COUNTRIES MAY NOT PROTECT OUR PROPRIETARY RIGHTS TO THE SAME EXTENT AS THE LAWS OF THE UNITED STATES. THE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH PATENTS

AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY ARE MORE FULLY DISCUSSED IN THE SECTION OF THIS REPORT ENTITLED RISK FACTORS, INCLUDING THE RISK FACTORS ENTITLED OUR PROPRIETARY RIGHTS MAY PROVE DIFFICULT TO ENFORCE, WE MAY BE FOUND TO

INFRINGE ON INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS OF OTHERS, AND WE RELY ON THE AVAILABILITY OF THIRD PARTY LICENSES.

EMPLOYEES

AS OF JULY 31, 2004, WE EMPLOYED MORE

THAN 34,000 EMPLOYEES, INCLUDING APPROXIMATELY 6,000 IN MANUFACTURING AND SERVICE, APPROXIMATELY 12,000 IN ENGINEERING, APPROXIMATELY 13,000 IN SALES AND MARKETING, AND APPROXIMATELY 3,000 IN FINANCE AND ADMINISTRATION. APPROXIMATELY 9,600 EMPLOYEES

ARE IN LOCATIONS OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES. WE CONSIDER THE RELATIONSHIPS WITH OUR EMPLOYEES TO BE POSITIVE. COMPETITION FOR TECHNICAL PERSONNEL IN THE INDUSTRY IN WHICH WE COMPETE IS INTENSE. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR FUTURE SUCCESS DEPENDS IN PART ON

OUR CONTINUED ABILITY TO HIRE, ASSIMILATE, AND RETAIN QUALIFIED PERSONNEL. TO DATE, WE BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN RECRUITING QUALIFIED EMPLOYEES, BUT THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL CONTINUE TO BE SUCCESSFUL IN THE FUTURE.

RISK FACTORS

SET FORTH BELOW AND ELSEWHERE IN

THIS REPORT AND IN OTHER DOCUMENTS WE FILE WITH THE SEC ARE RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES THAT COULD CAUSE ACTUAL RESULTS TO DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THE RESULTS CONTEMPLATED BY THE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS CONTAINED IN THIS REPORT.

OUR OPERATING RESULTS MAY FLUCTUATE IN FUTURE PERIODS, WHICH MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR

STOCK PRICE

OUR OPERATING RESULTS HAVE BEEN IN THE PAST, AND WILL

CONTINUE TO BE, SUBJECT TO QUARTERLY AND ANNUAL FLUCTUATIONS AS A RESULT OF NUMEROUS FACTORS. THESE FACTORS INCLUDE.



FLUCTUATIONS IN DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, ESPECIALLY WITH RESPECT TO INTERNET BUSINESSES AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICE PROVIDERS



CHANGES IN SALES AND IMPLEMENTATION CYCLES FOR OUR PRODUCTS AND REDUCED VISIBILITY INTO OUR CUSTOMERS SPENDING PLANS AND ASSOCIATED REVENUE



OUR ABILITY TO MAINTAIN APPROPRIATE INVENTORY LEVELS AND PURCHASE COMMITMENTS



PRICE AND PRODUCT COMPETITION IN THE COMMUNICATIONS AND NETWORKING INDUSTRIES, WHICH CAN CHANGE RAPIDLY DUE TO TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATION



THE OVERALL MOVEMENT TOWARD INDUSTRY CONSOLIDATION AMONG BOTH OUR COMPETITORS AND OUR CUSTOMERS



THE INTRODUCTION AND MARKET ACCEPTANCE OF NEW TECHNOLOGIES AND PRODUCTS AND OUR SUCCESS IN NEW MARKETS, AS WELL AS THE ADOPTION OF NEW NETWORKING STANDARDS



VARIATIONS IN SALES CHANNELS, PRODUCT COSTS, OR MIX OF PRODUCTS SOLD



THE TIMING, SIZE, AND MIX OF ORDERS FROM CUSTOMERS



MANUFACTURING LEAD TIMES



FLUCTUATIONS IN OUR GROSS MARGINS, AND THE FACTORS THAT CONTRIBUTE TO THIS AS DESCRIBED BELOW



OUR ABILITY TO ACHIEVE TARGETED COST REDUCTIONS



THE ABILITY OF OUR CUSTOMERS, CHANNEL PARTNERS, AND SUPPLIERS TO OBTAIN FINANCING OR TO FUND CAPITAL EXPENDITURES



THE TIMING AND AMOUNT OF EMPLOYER PAYROLL TAX TO BE PAID ON EMPLOYEES GAINS ON STOCK OPTIONS EXERCISED



ACTUAL EVENTS, CIRCUMSTANCES, OUTCOMES, AND AMOUNTS DIFFERING FROM JUDGMENTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND ESTIMATES USED IN DETERMINING THE VALUES OF CERTAIN ASSETS (INCLUDING THE AMOUNTS OF

RELATED VALUATION ALLOWANCES), LIABILITIES, AND OTHER ITEMS REFLECTED IN OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

HOW WELL WE EXECUTE ON OUR STRATEGY AND OPERATING PLANS



CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING RULES, SUCH AS RECORDING EXPENSES FOR EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTION GRANTS

AS A CONSEQUENCE, OPERATING RESULTS FOR A PARTICULAR FUTURE PERIOD ARE DIFFICULT TO PREDICT, AND, THEREFORE, PRIOR RESULTS ARE NOT

NECESSARILY INDICATIVE OF RESULTS TO BE EXPECTED IN FUTURE PERIODS. ANY OF THE FOREGOING FACTORS, OR ANY OTHER FACTORS DISCUSSED ELSEWHERE HEREIN, COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

THAT COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR STOCK PRICE.

OUR OPERATING RESULTS MAY BE

ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY THE UNCERTAIN GEOPOLITICAL ENVIRONMENT AND UNFAVORABLE ECONOMIC AND MARKET CONDITIONS

ECONOMIC CONDITIONS WORLDWIDE HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO RECENT SLOWDOWNS IN THE COMMUNICATIONS AND NETWORKING INDUSTRIES AND MAY CONTINUE TO IMPACT OUR BUSINESS, RESULTING IN.



REDUCED DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS AS A RESULT OF CONTINUED CONSTRAINTS ON INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY-RELATED CAPITAL SPENDING BY OUR CUSTOMERS, PARTICULARLY SERVICE PROVIDERS



INCREASED PRICE COMPETITION FOR OUR PRODUCTS, NOT ONLY FROM OUR COMPETITORS BUT ALSO AS A CONSEQUENCE OF CUSTOMERS DISPOSING OF UNUTILIZED PRODUCTS



RISK OF EXCESS AND OBSOLETE INVENTORIES



EXCESS FACILITIES AND MANUFACTURING CAPACITY



HIGHER OVERHEAD COSTS AS A PERCENTAGE OF REVENUES

RECENT TURMOIL IN THE GEOPOLITICAL ENVIRONMENT IN MANY PARTS OF THE WORLD, INCLUDING TERRORIST ACTIVITIES AND MILITARY ACTIONS, PARTICULARLY THE CONTINUING TENSION IN AND

SURROUNDING IRAQ, MAY CONTINUE TO PUT PRESSURE ON GLOBAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS. IF THE ECONOMIC AND MARKET CONDITIONS IN THE UNITED STATES AND GLOBALLY DO NOT IMPROVE, OR IF THEY DETERIORATE, WE MAY EXPERIENCE MATERIAL IMPACTS ON OUR BUSINESS,

OPERATING RESULTS, AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

OUR REVENUES FOR A PARTICULAR

PERIOD ARE DIFFICULT TO PREDICT, AND A SHORTFALL IN REVENUES MAY HARM OUR OPERATING RESULTS

AS A RESULT OF A VARIETY OF FACTORS DISCUSSED IN THIS REPORT, OUR REVENUES FOR A PARTICULAR QUARTER ARE DIFFICULT TO PREDICT. OUR NET SALES MAY GROW AT A SLOWER RATE THAN IN PAST PERIODS AND MAY DECLINE. OUR ABILITY

TO MEET FINANCIAL EXPECTATIONS COULD ALSO BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED IF THE NONLINEAR SALES PATTERN SEEN IN SOME OF OUR PAST QUARTERS RECURS IN FUTURE PERIODS. WE HAVE EXPERIENCED PERIODS OF TIME DURING WHICH SHIPMENTS HAVE EXCEEDED NET BOOKINGS OR

MANUFACTURING ISSUES HAVE DELAYED SHIPMENTS, LEADING TO NONLINEARITY IN SHIPPING PATTERNS. IN ADDITION TO MAKING IT DIFFICULT TO PREDICT REVENUES FOR A PARTICULAR PERIOD, NONLINEARITY IN SHIPPING CAN INCREASE COSTS, AS IRREGULAR SHIPMENT PATTERNS

RESULT IN PERIODS OF UNDERUTILIZED CAPACITY AND PERIODS WHEN OVERTIME EXPENSES MAY BE INCURRED, AS WELL AS LEADING TO ADDITIONAL COSTS ARISING OUT OF INVENTORY MANAGEMENT. IN ADDITION, TO THE EXTENT THAT MANUFACTURING ISSUES AND ANY RELATED

COMPONENT SHORTAGES RESULT IN DELAYED SHIPMENTS IN THE FUTURE, AND PARTICULARLY IN PERIODS WHEN WE AND OUR CONTRACT MANUFACTURERS ARE OPERATING AT HIGHER LEVELS OF CAPACITY, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT REVENUES FOR A QUARTER COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED IF

SUCH MATTERS ARE NOT REMEDIATED WITHIN THE SAME QUARTER.

IN ADDITION, TO

IMPROVE CUSTOMER SATISFACTION, WE CONTINUE TO ATTEMPT TO IMPROVE OUR MANUFACTURING LEAD TIME PERFORMANCE, WHICH MAY RESULT IN CORRESPONDING REDUCTIONS IN ORDER BACKLOG. A DECLINE IN BACKLOG LEVELS COULD RESULT IN MORE VARIABILITY AND LESS

PREDICTABILITY IN OUR QUARTER-TO-QUARTER NET SALES AND OPERATING RESULTS. LONG MANUFACTURING LEAD TIMES HAVE CAUSED OUR CUSTOMERS IN THE PAST TO PLACE THE SAME ORDER MULTIPLE TIMES WITHIN OUR VARIOUS SALES CHANNELS AND TO CANCEL THE DUPLICATIVE

ORDERS UPON RECEIPT OF THE PRODUCT OR TO PLACE ORDERS WITH OTHER VENDORS WITH SHORTER MANUFACTURING LEAD TIMES. SUCH MULTIPLE ORDERING (ALONG WITH OTHER FACTORS) MAY CAUSE DIFFICULTY IN PREDICTING OUR SALES AND, AS A RESULT, COULD IMPAIR OUR ABILITY

TO MANAGE PARTS INVENTORY EFFECTIVELY.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

WE PLAN OUR OPERATING EXPENSE LEVELS BASED PRIMARILY ON FORECASTED REVENUE LEVELS. THESE EXPENSES AND THE IMPACT OF

LONG-TERM COMMITMENTS ARE RELATIVELY FIXED IN THE SHORT TERM. A SHORTFALL IN REVENUE COULD LEAD TO OPERATING RESULTS BEING BELOW EXPECTATIONS AS WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO QUICKLY REDUCE THESE FIXED EXPENSES IN RESPONSE TO SHORT TERM BUSINESS CHANGES.

ANY OF THE ABOVE FACTORS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR

OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL RESULTS.

WE EXPECT GROSS MARGIN TO VARY OVER TIME

AND OUR RECENT LEVEL OF PRODUCT GROSS MARGIN MAY NOT BE SUSTAINABLE

OUR

RECENT LEVEL OF PRODUCT GROSS MARGINS MAY NOT BE SUSTAINABLE AND MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED IN THE FUTURE BY NUMEROUS FACTORS, INCLUDING.



CHANGES IN CUSTOMER, GEOGRAPHIC, OR PRODUCT MIX, INCLUDING MIX OF CONFIGURATIONS WITHIN EACH PRODUCT GROUP



INCREASES IN MATERIAL OR LABOR COSTS



EXCESS INVENTORY



OBSOLESCENCE CHARGES



CHANGES IN SHIPMENT VOLUME



LOSS OF COST SAVINGS DUE TO CHANGES IN COMPONENT PRICING OR CHARGES INCURRED DUE TO INVENTORY HOLDING PERIODS IF PARTS ORDERING DOES NOT CORRECTLY ANTICIPATE PRODUCT DEMAND



INCREASED PRICE COMPETITION



CHANGES IN DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS



INCREASED WARRANTY COSTS



HOW WELL WE EXECUTE ON OUR STRATEGY AND OPERATING PLANS



INTRODUCTION OF NEW PRODUCTS OR ENTERING NEW MARKETS AND DIFFERENT PRICING AND COST STRUCTURES OF NEW MARKETS

CHANGES IN SERVICE GROSS MARGIN MAY RESULT FROM VARIOUS FACTORS SUCH AS CHANGES IN THE MIX

BETWEEN TECHNICAL SUPPORT SERVICES AND ADVANCED SERVICES, AS WELL AS THE TIMING OF TECHNICAL SUPPORT SERVICE CONTRACT INITIATIONS AND RENEWALS.

DISRUPTION OF OR CHANGES IN OUR DISTRIBUTION MODEL OR CUSTOMER BASE COULD HARM OUR SALES AND MARGINS

IF WE FAIL TO MANAGE DISTRIBUTION OF OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES PROPERLY, OR IF OUR DISTRIBUTORS FINANCIAL CONDITION OR OPERATIONS

WEAKEN, OUR REVENUES AND GROSS MARGINS COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED. FURTHERMORE, A CHANGE IN THE MIX OF OUR CUSTOMERS BETWEEN SERVICE PROVIDER AND ENTERPRISE, OR A CHANGE IN THE MIX OF DIRECT AND INDIRECT SALES, COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR REVENUES

AND GROSS MARGINS.

A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES

IS SOLD THROUGH OUR CHANNEL PARTNERS AND THE REMAINDER IS SOLD THROUGH DIRECT SALES. OUR CHANNEL PARTNERS INCLUDE SYSTEM INTEGRATORS, SERVICE PROVIDERS, OTHER RESELLERS, DISTRIBUTORS, AND RETAIL PARTNERS. SYSTEM INTEGRATORS AND SERVICE PROVIDERS

TYPICALLY SELL DIRECTLY TO END USERS AND OFTEN PROVIDE SYSTEM INSTALLATION, TECHNICAL SUPPORT, PROFESSIONAL SERVICES, AND OTHER SUPPORT SERVICES IN ADDITION TO NETWORK EQUIPMENT SALES. SYSTEM INTEGRATORS ALSO TYPICALLY INTEGRATE OUR PRODUCTS INTO AN

10

TABLE OF CONTENTS

OVERALL SOLUTION, AND A NUMBER OF SERVICE PROVIDERS ARE ALSO SYSTEM INTEGRATORS. DISTRIBUTORS STOCK INVENTORY AND

TYPICALLY SELL TO SYSTEM INTEGRATORS, SERVICE PROVIDERS, AND OTHER RESELLERS. IN ADDITION, WITH THE ACQUISITION OF THE LINKSYS BUSINESS, HOME NETWORKING PRODUCTS ARE GENERALLY SOLD THROUGH DISTRIBUTORS AND RETAIL PARTNERS. WE REFER TO SALES THROUGH

DISTRIBUTORS AND RETAIL PARTNERS AS OUR TWO-TIER SYSTEM OF SALES TO THE END CUSTOMER. REVENUE FROM DISTRIBUTORS AND RETAIL PARTNERS IS RECOGNIZED BASED ON A SELL-THROUGH METHOD USING INFORMATION PROVIDED BY THEM. THESE DISTRIBUTORS AND RETAIL

PARTNERS ARE GENERALLY GIVEN BUSINESS TERMS, WHICH ALLOW THEM TO RETURN A PORTION OF INVENTORY, RECEIVE CREDITS FOR CHANGES IN SELLING PRICES, AND PARTICIPATE IN VARIOUS COOPERATIVE MARKETING PROGRAMS. IF SALES THROUGH INDIRECT CHANNELS INCREASE,

THIS MAY LEAD TO GREATER DIFFICULTY IN FORECASTING THE MIX OF OUR PRODUCTS AND, TO A CERTAIN DEGREE, THE TIMING OF ORDERS FROM OUR CUSTOMERS.

HISTORICALLY, WE HAVE SEEN FLUCTUATIONS IN OUR GROSS MARGINS BASED ON CHANGES IN THE BALANCE OF OUR DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS. ALTHOUGH VARIABILITY TO DATE HAS NOT BEEN

SIGNIFICANT, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT CHANGES IN THE BALANCE OF OUR DISTRIBUTION MODEL IN FUTURE PERIODS WOULD NOT HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR GROSS MARGINS AND PROFITABILITY.

SOME FACTORS COULD RESULT IN DISRUPTION OF OR CHANGES IN OUR DISTRIBUTION MODEL OR CUSTOMER

BASE, WHICH COULD HARM OUR SALES AND MARGINS, INCLUDING THE FOLLOWING.



WE COMPETE WITH SOME OF OUR CHANNEL PARTNERS THROUGH OUR DIRECT SALES, WHICH MAY LEAD THESE CHANNEL PARTNERS TO USE OTHER SUPPLIERS THAT DO NOT DIRECTLY SELL THEIR OWN PRODUCTS



SOME OF OUR CHANNEL PARTNERS MAY DEMAND THAT WE ABSORB A GREATER SHARE OF THE RISKS THAT THEIR CUSTOMERS MAY ASK THEM TO BEAR



SOME OF OUR CHANNEL PARTNERS MAY HAVE INSUFFICIENT FINANCIAL RESOURCES AND MAY NOT BE ABLE TO WITHSTAND CHANGES IN BUSINESS CONDITIONS



AS WE DEVELOP MORE SOLUTION-ORIENTED PRODUCTS, ENTERPRISE CUSTOMERS MAY DEMAND RIGOROUS ACCEPTANCE TESTING OR PRIME CONTRACTING SIMILAR TO THE REQUIREMENTS OF OUR SERVICE PROVIDER

CUSTOMERS

OUR INVENTORY MANAGEMENT RELATING TO OUR SALES TO

OUR TWO-TIER DISTRIBUTION CHANNEL IS COMPLEX, AND EXCESS INVENTORY MAY HARM OUR GROSS MARGINS

WE MUST MANAGE OUR INVENTORY RELATING TO SALES TO OUR DISTRIBUTORS AND RETAIL PARTNERS EFFECTIVELY, BECAUSE INVENTORY HELD BY THEM COULD AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. OUR DISTRIBUTORS AND RETAIL PARTNERS MAY

INCREASE ORDERS DURING PERIODS OF PRODUCT SHORTAGES, CANCEL ORDERS IF THEIR INVENTORY IS TOO HIGH, OR DELAY ORDERS IN ANTICIPATION OF NEW PRODUCTS. THEY ALSO MAY ADJUST THEIR ORDERS IN RESPONSE TO THE SUPPLY OF OUR PRODUCTS AND THE PRODUCTS OF OUR

COMPETITORS THAT ARE AVAILABLE TO THEM AND IN RESPONSE TO SEASONAL FLUCTUATIONS IN END USER DEMAND. REVENUE TO OUR DISTRIBUTORS AND RETAIL PARTNERS IS RECOGNIZED BASED ON A SELL-THROUGH METHOD USING INFORMATION PROVIDED BY THEM, AND THEY ARE

GENERALLY GIVEN BUSINESS TERMS THAT ALLOW THEM TO RETURN A PORTION OF INVENTORY, RECEIVE CREDITS FOR CHANGES IN SELLING PRICE, AND PARTICIPATE IN VARIOUS COOPERATIVE MARKETING PROGRAMS. IN ADDITION, DUE TO THE EXPANSION OF OUR PRODUCT LINE BREADTH

AND CONTINUED NEED FOR HIGHER INVENTORY LEVELS OF CERTAIN SUBASSEMBLIES OF HIGH-DEMAND PRODUCTS IN ORDER TO MANAGE CUSTOMER LEAD TIMES, OUR INVENTORY LEVELS HAVE INCREASED IN RECENT PERIODS. WE MAY CONTINUE TO SEE THESE HIGHER INVENTORIES IN THE

SHORTER TERM. INVENTORY MANAGEMENT REMAINS AN AREA OF FOCUS AS WE BALANCE THE NEED TO MAINTAIN STRATEGIC INVENTORY LEVELS TO ENSURE COMPETITIVE LEAD TIMES AGAINST THE RISK OF INVENTORY OBSOLESCENCE BECAUSE OF RAPIDLY CHANGING TECHNOLOGY AND CUSTOMER

REQUIREMENTS. IF WE ULTIMATELY DETERMINE THAT WE HAVE EXCESS INVENTORY, WE MAY HAVE TO REDUCE OUR PRICES AND WRITE-DOWN INVENTORY, WHICH IN TURN COULD RESULT IN LOWER GROSS MARGINS.

SALES TO THE SERVICE PROVIDER MARKET ARE ESPECIALLY VOLATILE, AND CONTINUED DECLINES OR DELAYS IN SALES ORDERS FROM THIS INDUSTRY MAY

HARM OUR OPERATING RESULTS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

SALES TO THE SERVICE

PROVIDER MARKET HAVE BEEN CHARACTERIZED BY LARGE AND OFTEN SPORADIC PURCHASES WITH LONGER SALES CYCLES. WE HAVE EXPERIENCED SIGNIFICANT DECREASES IN SALES TO SERVICE PROVIDERS AS MARKET CONDITIONS HAVE CHANGED. SALES ACTIVITY IN THIS INDUSTRY

DEPENDS UPON THE STAGE OF COMPLETION OF EXPANDING NETWORK INFRASTRUCTURES; THE AVAILABILITY OF FUNDING; AND THE EXTENT THAT SERVICE PROVIDERS ARE AFFECTED BY REGULATORY, ECONOMIC, AND BUSINESS CONDITIONS IN THE COUNTRY OF OPERATIONS. ALTHOUGH SOME

SERVICE PROVIDERS MAY BE INCREASING CAPITAL EXPENDITURES OVER THE DEPRESSED LEVELS THAT HAVE PREVAILED OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS, CONTINUED DECLINES OR DELAYS IN ORDERS FROM THIS INDUSTRY COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, OPERATING

RESULTS, AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. THE RECENT SLOWDOWN IN THE GENERAL ECONOMY, OVERCAPACITY, CHANGES IN THE SERVICE PROVIDER MARKET, AND CONSTRAINTS ON CAPITAL AVAILABILITY

11

TABLE OF CONTENTS

HAVE HAD A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON MANY OF OUR SERVICE PROVIDER CUSTOMERS, WITH MANY OF SUCH CUSTOMERS GOING OUT OF

BUSINESS OR SUBSTANTIALLY REDUCING THEIR EXPANSION PLANS. THESE CONDITIONS HAVE MATERIALLY HARMED OUR BUSINESS AND OPERATING RESULTS, AND WE EXPECT THAT SOME OR ALL OF THESE CONDITIONS MAY CONTINUE FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. FINALLY, SERVICE

PROVIDER CUSTOMERS TYPICALLY HAVE LONGER IMPLEMENTATION CYCLES; REQUIRE A BROADER RANGE OF SERVICE INCLUDING DESIGN SERVICES; DEMAND THAT VENDORS TAKE ON A LARGER SHARE OF RISKS; OFTEN REQUIRE ACCEPTANCE PROVISIONS, WHICH CAN LEAD TO A DELAY IN

REVENUE RECOGNITION; AND EXPECT FINANCING FROM VENDORS. ALL THESE FACTORS CAN ADD FURTHER RISK TO BUSINESS CONDUCTED WITH SERVICE PROVIDERS.

A SHORTAGE OF ADEQUATE COMPONENT SUPPLY OR MANUFACTURING CAPACITY COULD INCREASE OUR COSTS OR CAUSE A DELAY IN OUR ABILITY TO FULFILL ORDERS, AND OUR FAILURE TO

ESTIMATE CUSTOMER DEMAND PROPERLY MAY RESULT IN EXCESS OR OBSOLETE COMPONENT SUPPLY, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR GROSS MARGINS

OUR GROWTH AND ABILITY TO MEET CUSTOMER DEMANDS DEPEND IN PART ON OUR ABILITY TO OBTAIN TIMELY DELIVERIES OF PARTS FROM OUR SUPPLIERS AND CONTRACT MANUFACTURERS. WE HAVE

EXPERIENCED COMPONENT SHORTAGES IN THE PAST, INCLUDING SHORTAGES CAUSED BY MANUFACTURING PROCESS ISSUES, WHICH HAVE AFFECTED OUR OPERATIONS. WE MAY IN THE FUTURE EXPERIENCE A SHORTAGE OF CERTAIN COMPONENT PARTS AS A RESULT OF OUR OWN MANUFACTURING

PROCESS ISSUES, MANUFACTURING PROCESS ISSUES AT OUR SUPPLIERS OR CONTRACT MANUFACTURERS, CAPACITY PROBLEMS EXPERIENCED BY OUR SUPPLIERS OR CONTRACT MANUFACTURERS, OR STRONG DEMAND IN THE INDUSTRY FOR THOSE PARTS, ESPECIALLY IF THE ECONOMY GROWS.

GROWTH IN THE ECONOMY IS LIKELY TO CREATE GREATER PRESSURES ON US AND OUR SUPPLIERS TO ACCURATELY PROJECT OVERALL COMPONENT DEMAND AND COMPONENT DEMANDS WITHIN SPECIFIC PRODUCT CATEGORIES AND TO ESTABLISH OPTIMAL COMPONENT LEVELS. IF SHORTAGES OR

DELAYS PERSIST, THE PRICE OF THESE COMPONENTS MAY INCREASE, OR THE COMPONENTS MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE AT ALL, AND WE MAY ALSO ENCOUNTER SHORTAGES IF WE DO NOT ACCURATELY ANTICIPATE OUR NEEDS. WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO SECURE ENOUGH COMPONENTS AT REASONABLE

PRICES OR OF ACCEPTABLE QUALITY TO BUILD NEW PRODUCTS IN A TIMELY MANNER IN THE QUANTITIES OR CONFIGURATIONS NEEDED. ACCORDINGLY, OUR REVENUES AND GROSS MARGINS COULD SUFFER UNTIL OTHER SOURCES CAN BE DEVELOPED. OUR OPERATING RESULTS WOULD ALSO BE

ADVERSELY AFFECTED IF, ANTICIPATING GREATER DEMAND THAN ACTUALLY DEVELOPS, WE COMMIT TO THE PURCHASE OF MORE COMPONENTS THAN WE NEED. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL NOT ENCOUNTER THESE PROBLEMS IN THE FUTURE. ALTHOUGH IN MANY CASES WE USE

STANDARD PARTS AND COMPONENTS FOR OUR PRODUCTS, CERTAIN COMPONENTS ARE PRESENTLY AVAILABLE ONLY FROM A SINGLE SOURCE OR LIMITED SOURCES. WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO DIVERSIFY SOURCES IN A TIMELY MANNER, WHICH COULD HARM OUR ABILITY TO DELIVER PRODUCTS TO

CUSTOMERS AND SERIOUSLY IMPACT PRESENT AND FUTURE SALES.

WE BELIEVE THAT WE

MAY BE FACED WITH THE FOLLOWING CHALLENGES IN THE FUTURE.



NEW MARKETS IN WHICH WE PARTICIPATE MAY GROW QUICKLY, WHICH MAY MAKE IT DIFFICULT TO QUICKLY OBTAIN SIGNIFICANT COMPONENT CAPACITY



AS WE ACQUIRE COMPANIES AND NEW TECHNOLOGIES, WE ARE DEPENDENT, AT LEAST INITIALLY, ON UNFAMILIAR SUPPLY CHAINS OR RELATIVELY SMALL SUPPLY PARTNERS



WE FACE COMPETITION FOR CERTAIN COMPONENTS, WHICH ARE SUPPLY CONSTRAINED, FROM EXISTING COMPETITORS AND COMPANIES IN OTHER MARKETS

MANUFACTURING CAPACITY AND COMPONENT SUPPLY CONSTRAINTS COULD BE SIGNIFICANT ISSUES FOR US.

WE PURCHASE COMPONENTS FROM A VARIETY OF SUPPLIERS AND USE SEVERAL CONTRACT MANUFACTURERS TO PROVIDE MANUFACTURING SERVICES FOR OUR PRODUCTS. DURING THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS, IN ORDER TO IMPROVE MANUFACTURING LEAD TIME PERFORMANCE AND TO HELP

ASSURE ADEQUATE COMPONENT SUPPLY, WE ENTER INTO AGREEMENTS WITH CONTRACT MANUFACTURERS AND SUPPLIERS THAT EITHER ALLOW THEM TO PROCURE INVENTORY BASED UPON CRITERIA AS DEFINED BY US OR THAT ESTABLISH THE PARAMETERS DEFINING OUR REQUIREMENTS. IN

CERTAIN INSTANCES, THESE AGREEMENTS ALLOW US THE OPTION TO CANCEL, RESCHEDULE, AND ADJUST OUR REQUIREMENTS BASED ON OUR BUSINESS NEEDS PRIOR TO FIRM ORDERS BEING PLACED. IF WE FAIL TO ANTICIPATE CUSTOMER DEMAND PROPERLY, AN OVERSUPPLY OF PARTS COULD

RESULT IN EXCESS OR OBSOLETE COMPONENTS THAT COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR GROSS MARGINS. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING OUR PURCHASE COMMITMENTS, SEE NOTE 8 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN OUR 2004 ANNUAL REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS. A

REDUCTION OR INTERRUPTION IN SUPPLY; A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN THE PRICE OF ONE OR MORE COMPONENTS; A FAILURE TO ADEQUATELY AUTHORIZE PROCUREMENT OF INVENTORY BY OUR CONTRACT MANUFACTURERS; A FAILURE TO APPROPRIATELY CANCEL, RESCHEDULE, OR ADJUST

OUR REQUIREMENTS BASED ON OUR BUSINESS NEEDS; OR A DECREASE IN DEMAND FOR PRODUCTS COULD MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, OPERATING RESULTS, AND FINANCIAL CONDITION AND COULD MATERIALLY DAMAGE CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIPS. FURTHERMORE, AS A

RESULT OF BINDING PRICE OR PURCHASE COMMITMENTS WITH SUPPLIERS, WE MAY BE OBLIGATED TO PURCHASE COMPONENTS AT PRICES THAT ARE HIGHER THAN THOSE AVAILABLE IN THE CURRENT MARKET. IN THE EVENT THAT WE BECOME COMMITTED TO PURCHASE COMPONENTS AT PRICES

IN EXCESS OF THE CURRENT MARKET PRICE WHEN THE COMPONENTS ARE ACTUALLY USED, OUR GROSS MARGINS COULD DECREASE.

THE FACT THAT WE DO NOT OWN THE BULK OF OUR MANUFACTURING FACILITIES COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON THE SUPPLY OF OUR PRODUCTS AND ON OPERATING RESULTS. FINANCIAL PROBLEMS OF CONTRACT MANUFACTURERS ON WHOM WE RELY,

OR RESERVATION OF MANUFACTURING CAPACITY BY OTHER COMPANIES, INSIDE OR OUTSIDE OF OUR INDUSTRY, COULD EITHER LIMIT SUPPLY OR INCREASE COSTS.

THE MARKETS IN WHICH WE COMPETE ARE INTENSELY COMPETITIVE, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR REVENUE GROWTH

FOR INFORMATION REGARDING OUR COMPETITION AND THE RISKS ARISING OUT OF

THE COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH WE OPERATE, SEE THE SECTION ENTITLED COMPETITION CONTAINED IN ITEM 1 OF THIS REPORT.

WE DEPEND UPON THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW PRODUCTS AND ENHANCEMENTS TO EXISTING PRODUCTS, AND IF WE FAIL TO PREDICT AND RESPOND TO EMERGING TECHNOLOGICAL TRENDS AND

CUSTOMERS CHANGING NEEDS, OUR OPERATING RESULTS AND MARKET SHARE MAY SUFFER

THE MARKETS FOR OUR PRODUCTS ARE CHARACTERIZED BY RAPIDLY CHANGING TECHNOLOGY, EVOLVING INDUSTRY STANDARDS, NEW PRODUCT INTRODUCTIONS, AND EVOLVING METHODS OF BUILDING AND OPERATING NETWORKS. OUR OPERATING RESULTS DEPEND ON OUR ABILITY TO

DEVELOP AND INTRODUCE NEW PRODUCTS INTO EXISTING AND EMERGING MARKETS AND TO REDUCE THE PRODUCTION COSTS OF EXISTING PRODUCTS. WE BELIEVE THAT THE INTERNET AND THE VARIOUS NETWORKS ASSOCIATED WITH IT, INCLUDING CORPORATE INTRANETS, CABLE, BROADBAND

AND DIALUP NETWORKS, VOICE AND VIDEO NETWORKS, WILL EVOLVE TO INCLUDE EMBEDDED RESOURCES AND THE VIRTUALIZATION OF APPLICATIONS AND SERVICES TO PRODUCE AN INTEGRATED, INTELLIGENT SYSTEM, OR AS WE REFER TO IT, AN INTELLIGENT INFORMATION NETWORK. THIS

IS OUR VISION FOR THE EVOLUTION OF NETWORKING FROM CONNECTIVITY PRODUCTS TO INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS. AS SUCH, MANY OF OUR STRATEGIC INITIATIVES AND INVESTMENTS ARE AIMED AT MEETING THE REQUIREMENTS THAT AN INTELLIGENT INFORMATION NETWORK WOULD DEMAND.

THE PROCESS OF DEVELOPING NEW TECHNOLOGY IS COMPLEX AND UNCERTAIN, AND IF WE FAIL TO ACCURATELY PREDICT CUSTOMERS CHANGING NEEDS AND EMERGING TECHNOLOGICAL TRENDS, OUR BUSINESS COULD BE HARMED. WE MUST COMMIT SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES TO

DEVELOPING NEW PRODUCTS BEFORE KNOWING WHETHER OUR INVESTMENTS WILL RESULT IN PRODUCTS THE MARKET WILL ACCEPT. IN PARTICULAR, IF OUR MODEL OF THE EVOLUTION OF NETWORKING FROM CONNECTIVITY PRODUCTS TO INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS DOES NOT EMERGE AS WE BELIEVE

IT WILL, MANY OF OUR STRATEGIC INITIATIVES AND INVESTMENTS MAY BE OF NO OR LIMITED VALUE. FURTHERMORE, WE MAY NOT EXECUTE SUCCESSFULLY ON THAT VISION BECAUSE OF ERRORS IN PRODUCT PLANNING OR TIMING, TECHNICAL HURDLES THAT WE FAIL TO OVERCOME IN A

TIMELY FASHION, OR A LACK OF APPROPRIATE RESOURCES. THIS COULD RESULT IN COMPETITORS PROVIDING THOSE SOLUTIONS BEFORE WE DO AND LOSS OF MARKET SHARE, REVENUES, AND EARNINGS. THE SUCCESS OF NEW PRODUCTS IS DEPENDENT ON SEVERAL FACTORS, INCLUDING

PROPER NEW PRODUCT DEFINITION, COMPONENT COSTS, TIMELY COMPLETION AND INTRODUCTION OF THESE PRODUCTS, DIFFERENTIATION OF NEW PRODUCTS FROM THOSE OF OUR COMPETITORS, AND MARKET ACCEPTANCE OF THESE PRODUCTS. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL

SUCCESSFULLY IDENTIFY NEW PRODUCT OPPORTUNITIES, DEVELOP AND BRING NEW PRODUCTS TO MARKET IN A TIMELY MANNER, OR ACHIEVE MARKET ACCEPTANCE OF OUR PRODUCTS OR THAT PRODUCTS AND TECHNOLOGIES DEVELOPED BY OTHERS WILL NOT RENDER OUR PRODUCTS OR

TECHNOLOGIES OBSOLETE OR NONCOMPETITIVE. SPECIFICALLY, THE PRODUCTS AND TECHNOLOGIES THAT WE HAVE IDENTIFIED AS ADVANCED TECHNOLOGIES MAY NOT PROVE TO HAVE THE MARKET SUCCESS WE ANTICIPATE, AND WE MAY NOT SUCCESSFULLY IDENTIFY AND INVEST

IN OTHER ADVANCED TECHNOLOGIES.

OUR BUSINESS SUBSTANTIALLY DEPENDS UPON THE

CONTINUED GROWTH OF THE INTERNET AND INTERNET-BASED SYSTEMS

A SUBSTANTIAL

PORTION OF OUR BUSINESS AND REVENUE DEPENDS ON GROWTH OF THE INTERNET AND ON THE DEPLOYMENT OF OUR PRODUCTS BY CUSTOMERS WHO DEPEND ON THE CONTINUED GROWTH OF THE INTERNET. AS A RESULT OF THE RECENT ECONOMIC SLOWDOWN AND REDUCTION IN CAPITAL

SPENDING, WHICH HAVE PARTICULARLY AFFECTED TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICE PROVIDERS, SPENDING ON INTERNET INFRASTRUCTURE DECLINED, WHICH HAS MATERIALLY HARMED OUR BUSINESS. TO THE EXTENT THAT THE ECONOMIC SLOWDOWN AND REDUCTION IN CAPITAL SPENDING

CONTINUE TO ADVERSELY AFFECT SPENDING ON INTERNET INFRASTRUCTURE, WE COULD CONTINUE TO EXPERIENCE MATERIAL HARM TO OUR BUSINESS, OPERATING RESULTS, AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

BECAUSE OF THE RAPID INTRODUCTION OF NEW PRODUCTS AND CHANGING CUSTOMER REQUIREMENTS RELATED TO MATTERS SUCH AS COST-EFFECTIVENESS AND

SECURITY, WE BELIEVE THAT THERE COULD BE CERTAIN PERFORMANCE PROBLEMS WITH INTERNET COMMUNICATIONS IN THE FUTURE, WHICH COULD RECEIVE A HIGH DEGREE OF PUBLICITY AND VISIBILITY. AS WE ARE A LARGE SUPPLIER OF NETWORKING PRODUCTS, OUR BUSINESS,

OPERATING RESULTS, AND FINANCIAL CONDITION MAY BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER OR NOT THESE PROBLEMS ARE DUE TO THE PERFORMANCE OF OUR OWN PRODUCTS. SUCH AN EVENT COULD ALSO RESULT IN A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE MARKET

PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK INDEPENDENT OF DIRECT EFFECTS ON OUR BUSINESS.

CHANGES IN INDUSTRY STRUCTURE AND MARKET CONDITIONS COULD LEAD TO CHARGES RELATED TO DISCONTINUANCES OF CERTAIN OF OUR PRODUCTS OR BUSINESSES AND ASSET IMPAIRMENTS

IN RESPONSE TO CHANGES IN INDUSTRY AND MARKET CONDITIONS, WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO STRATEGICALLY REALIGN OUR RESOURCES AND CONSIDER

RESTRUCTURING, DISPOSING OF, OR OTHERWISE EXITING BUSINESSES. ANY DECISION TO LIMIT INVESTMENT IN OR DISPOSE OF OR OTHERWISE EXIT BUSINESSES MAY RESULT IN THE RECORDING OF SPECIAL CHARGES, SUCH AS INVENTORY AND TECHNOLOGY RELATED WRITE-OFFS,

WORKFORCE REDUCTION COSTS, CHARGES RELATING TO CONSOLIDATION OF EXCESS FACILITIES, OR CLAIMS FROM THIRD PARTIES WHO WERE RESELLERS OR USERS OF DISCONTINUED PRODUCTS. OUR ESTIMATES WITH RESPECT TO THE USEFUL LIFE OR ULTIMATE RECOVERABILITY OF OUR

CARRYING BASIS OF ASSETS, INCLUDING PURCHASED INTANGIBLE ASSETS, COULD CHANGE AS A RESULT OF SUCH ASSESSMENTS AND DECISIONS. FURTHER, OUR ESTIMATES RELATING TO THE LIABILITIES FOR EXCESS

13

TABLE OF CONTENTS

FACILITIES ARE AFFECTED BY CHANGES IN REAL ESTATE MARKET CONDITIONS. ADDITIONALLY, WE ARE REQUIRED TO PERFORM GOODWILL

IMPAIRMENT TESTS ON AN ANNUAL BASIS AND BETWEEN ANNUAL TESTS IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT FUTURE GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT TESTS WILL NOT RESULT IN A CHARGE TO EARNINGS.

WE HAVE MADE AND EXPECT TO CONTINUE TO MAKE ACQUISITIONS THAT COULD DISRUPT OUR OPERATIONS

AND HARM OUR OPERATING RESULTS

OUR GROWTH IS DEPENDENT UPON MARKET

GROWTH, OUR ABILITY TO ENHANCE OUR EXISTING PRODUCTS, AND OUR ABILITY TO INTRODUCE NEW PRODUCTS ON A TIMELY BASIS. WE INTEND TO CONTINUE TO ADDRESS THE NEED TO DEVELOP NEW PRODUCTS AND ENHANCE EXISTING PRODUCTS THROUGH ACQUISITIONS OF OTHER

COMPANIES, PRODUCT LINES, TECHNOLOGIES, AND PERSONNEL. ACQUISITIONS INVOLVE NUMEROUS RISKS, INCLUDING THE FOLLOWING.



DIFFICULTIES IN INTEGRATING THE OPERATIONS, TECHNOLOGIES, PRODUCTS, AND PERSONNEL OF THE ACQUIRED COMPANIES



DIVERSION OF MANAGEMENTS ATTENTION FROM NORMAL DAILY OPERATIONS OF THE BUSINESS



POTENTIAL DIFFICULTIES IN COMPLETING PROJECTS ASSOCIATED WITH IN-PROCESS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT



DIFFICULTIES IN ENTERING MARKETS IN WHICH WE HAVE NO OR LIMITED DIRECT PRIOR EXPERIENCE AND WHERE COMPETITORS IN SUCH MARKETS HAVE STRONGER MARKET POSITIONS



INITIAL DEPENDENCE ON UNFAMILIAR SUPPLY CHAINS OR RELATIVELY SMALL SUPPLY PARTNERS



INSUFFICIENT REVENUES TO OFFSET INCREASED EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH ACQUISITIONS



THE POTENTIAL LOSS OF KEY EMPLOYEES OF THE ACQUIRED COMPANIES

ACQUISITIONS MAY ALSO CAUSE US TO.

MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS OF HIGH-TECHNOLOGY COMPANIES ARE INHERENTLY RISKY, AND NO ASSURANCE CAN BE GIVEN THAT OUR PREVIOUS OR FUTURE ACQUISITIONS WILL BE SUCCESSFUL AND

WILL NOT MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, OPERATING RESULTS, OR FINANCIAL CONDITION. FAILURE TO MANAGE AND SUCCESSFULLY INTEGRATE ACQUISITIONS COULD MATERIALLY HARM OUR BUSINESS AND OPERATING RESULTS. PRIOR ACQUISITIONS HAVE

14

TABLE OF CONTENTS

RESULTED IN A WIDE RANGE OF OUTCOMES, FROM SUCCESSFUL INTRODUCTION OF NEW PRODUCTS AND TECHNOLOGIES TO AN INABILITY TO DO

SO. EVEN WHEN AN ACQUIRED COMPANY HAS ALREADY DEVELOPED AND MARKETED PRODUCTS, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT PRODUCT ENHANCEMENTS WILL BE MADE IN A TIMELY FASHION OR THAT PREACQUISITION DUE DILIGENCE WILL HAVE IDENTIFIED ALL POSSIBLE ISSUES THAT

MIGHT ARISE WITH RESPECT TO SUCH PRODUCTS.

FROM TIME TO TIME, WE HAVE MADE

ACQUISITIONS THAT RESULT IN IN-PROCESS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES BEING CHARGED IN AN INDIVIDUAL QUARTER. THESE CHARGES MAY OCCUR IN ANY PARTICULAR QUARTER, RESULTING IN VARIABILITY IN OUR QUARTERLY EARNINGS.

RISKS RELATED TO NEW PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT ALSO APPLY TO ACQUISITIONS. PLEASE SEE THE RISK

FACTOR ABOVE ENTITLED WE DEPEND UPON THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW PRODUCTS AND ENHANCEMENTS TO EXISTING PRODUCTS, AND IF WE FAIL TO PREDICT AND RESPOND TO EMERGING TECHNOLOGICAL TRENDS AND CUSTOMERS CHANGING NEEDS, OUR OPERATING RESULTS AND

MARKET SHARE MAY SUFFER FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION.

ENTRANCE INTO NEW

OR DEVELOPING MARKETS EXPOSES US TO ADDITIONAL COMPETITION AND WILL LIKELY INCREASE DEMANDS ON OUR SERVICE AND SUPPORT OPERATIONS

AS WE FOCUS ON NEW MARKET OPPORTUNITIESFOR EXAMPLE, STORAGE; WIRELESS; SECURITY; AND TRANSPORTING DATA, VOICE, AND VIDEO TRAFFIC ACROSS THE SAME NETWORKWE

WILL INCREASINGLY COMPETE WITH LARGE TELECOMMUNICATIONS EQUIPMENT SUPPLIERS AS WELL AS STARTUP COMPANIES. SEVERAL OF OUR COMPETITORS MAY HAVE GREATER RESOURCES, INCLUDING TECHNICAL AND ENGINEERING RESOURCES, THAN WE DO. ADDITIONALLY, AS CUSTOMERS IN

THESE MARKETS COMPLETE INFRASTRUCTURE DEPLOYMENTS, THEY MAY REQUIRE GREATER LEVELS OF SERVICE, SUPPORT, AND FINANCING THAN WE HAVE PROVIDED IN THE PAST. DEMAND FOR THESE TYPES OF SERVICE OR FINANCING CONTRACTS MAY INCREASE IN THE FUTURE. THERE CAN

BE NO ASSURANCE THAT WE CAN PROVIDE PRODUCTS, SERVICE, SUPPORT, AND FINANCING TO EFFECTIVELY COMPETE FOR THESE MARKET OPPORTUNITIES. FURTHER, PROVISION OF GREATER LEVELS OF SERVICES BY US MAY RESULT IN A DELAY IN THE TIMING OF REVENUE RECOGNITION.

IN ADDITION, ENTRY INTO OTHER MARKETS, INCLUDING OUR RECENT ENTRY INTO THE CONSUMER MARKET, HAS SUBJECTED AND WILL SUBJECT US TO ADDITIONAL RISKS, PARTICULARLY TO THOSE MARKETS, INCLUDING THE EFFECTS OF GENERAL MARKET CONDITIONS AND REDUCED CONSUMER

CONFIDENCE.

PRODUCT QUALITY PROBLEMS COULD LEAD TO REDUCED REVENUES, GROSS

MARGINS, AND NET INCOME

WE PRODUCE HIGHLY COMPLEX PRODUCTS THAT

INCORPORATE LEADING-EDGE TECHNOLOGY, INCLUDING BOTH HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE. SOFTWARE TYPICALLY CONTAINS BUGS THAT CAN UNEXPECTEDLY INTERFERE WITH EXPECTED OPERATIONS. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT OUR PRESHIPMENT TESTING PROGRAMS WILL BE ADEQUATE TO

DETECT ALL DEFECTS, EITHER ONES IN INDIVIDUAL PRODUCTS OR ONES THAT COULD AFFECT NUMEROUS SHIPMENTS, WHICH MIGHT INTERFERE WITH CUSTOMER SATISFACTION, REDUCE SALES OPPORTUNITIES, OR AFFECT GROSS MARGINS. IN THE PAST, WE HAVE HAD TO REPLACE CERTAIN

COMPONENTS AND PROVIDE REMEDIATION IN RESPONSE TO THE DISCOVERY OF DEFECTS OR BUGS IN PRODUCTS THAT WE HAD SHIPPED. WHILE THE COST OF SUCH REMEDIATION HAS NOT BEEN MATERIAL IN THE PAST, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT SUCH A REMEDIATION, DEPENDING ON

THE PRODUCT INVOLVED, WOULD NOT HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT. AN INABILITY TO CURE A PRODUCT DEFECT COULD RESULT IN THE FAILURE OF A PRODUCT LINE, TEMPORARY OR PERMANENT WITHDRAWAL FROM A PRODUCT OR MARKET, DAMAGE TO OUR REPUTATION, INVENTORY COSTS, OR

PRODUCT REENGINEERING EXPENSES, ANY OF WHICH COULD HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON REVENUES, MARGINS, AND NET INCOME.

INDUSTRY CONSOLIDATION MAY LEAD TO INCREASED COMPETITION AND MAY HARM OUR OPERATING RESULTS

THERE HAS BEEN A TREND TOWARD INDUSTRY CONSOLIDATION IN OUR MARKETS FOR SEVERAL YEARS. WE EXPECT THIS TREND TO CONTINUE AS COMPANIES ATTEMPT

TO STRENGTHEN OR HOLD THEIR MARKET POSITIONS IN AN EVOLVING INDUSTRY AND AS COMPANIES ARE ACQUIRED OR ARE UNABLE TO CONTINUE OPERATIONS. WE BELIEVE THAT INDUSTRY CONSOLIDATION MAY RESULT IN STRONGER COMPETITORS THAT ARE BETTER ABLE TO COMPETE AS

SOLE-SOURCE VENDORS FOR CUSTOMERS. THIS COULD LEAD TO MORE VARIABILITY IN OPERATING RESULTS AND COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, OPERATING RESULTS, AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. FURTHERMORE, PARTICULARLY IN THE SERVICE PROVIDER

MARKET, RAPID CONSOLIDATION WILL LEAD TO FEWER CUSTOMERS, WITH THE EFFECT THAT LOSS OF A MAJOR CUSTOMER COULD HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON RESULTS NOT ANTICIPATED IN A CUSTOMER MARKETPLACE COMPOSED OF MORE NUMEROUS PARTICIPANTS.

DUE TO THE GLOBAL NATURE OF OUR OPERATIONS, POLITICAL OR ECONOMIC CHANGES OR OTHER FACTORS

IN A SPECIFIC COUNTRY OR REGION COULD HARM OUR COSTS, EXPENSES, AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

WE CONDUCT SIGNIFICANT SALES AND CUSTOMER SUPPORT OPERATIONS IN COUNTRIES OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES AND ALSO DEPEND ON NON-U.S. OPERATIONS OF OUR CONTRACT MANUFACTURERS AND OUR DISTRIBUTION PARTNERS. FOR FISCAL

2004, WE DERIVED 49.3% OF OUR REVENUES FROM SALES OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES. ACCORDINGLY, OUR FUTURE RESULTS COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY A VARIETY OF UNCONTROLLABLE AND CHANGING FACTORS, INCLUDING, AMONG OTHERS, FOREIGN CURRENCY

EXCHANGE RATES; POLITICAL OR SOCIAL UNREST OR ECONOMIC INSTABILITY IN A SPECIFIC COUNTRY OR REGION; TRADE PROTECTION MEASURES AND OTHER REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS, WHICH MAY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO IMPORT OR EXPORT OUR PRODUCTS FROM VARIOUS COUNTRIES;

POLITICAL CONSIDERATIONS THAT AFFECT SERVICE PROVIDER AND GOVERNMENT SPENDING PATTERNS; HEALTH OR SIMILAR ISSUES, SUCH AS THE OUTBREAK OF SEVERE ACUTE RESPIRATORY SYNDROME (SARS) IN ASIA; DIFFICULTIES IN STAFFING AND MANAGING INTERNATIONAL

OPERATIONS; AND ADVERSE TAX CONSEQUENCES, INCLUDING IMPOSITION OF WITHHOLDING OR OTHER TAXES ON PAYMENTS BY SUBSIDIARIES. ANY OR ALL OF THESE FACTORS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR COSTS, EXPENSES, AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

WE ARE EXPOSED TO FLUCTUATIONS IN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES THAT COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS AND CASH

FLOWS

BECAUSE A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR BUSINESS IS CONDUCTED OUTSIDE

THE UNITED STATES, WE FACE EXPOSURE TO ADVERSE MOVEMENTS IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES. THESE EXPOSURES MAY CHANGE OVER TIME AS BUSINESS PRACTICES EVOLVE AND COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS AND CASH FLOWS.

HISTORICALLY, OUR PRIMARY EXPOSURES HAVE RELATED TO NONDOLLAR-DENOMINATED SALES IN JAPAN, CANADA, AND AUSTRALIA AND CERTAIN NONDOLLAR-DENOMINATED OPERATING EXPENSES IN EUROPE, LATIN AMERICA, AND ASIA, WHERE WE SELL PRIMARILY IN U.S. DOLLARS.

ADDITIONALLY, WE HAVE EXPOSURES TO EMERGING MARKET CURRENCIES, WHICH CAN HAVE EXTREME CURRENCY VOLATILITY. AN INCREASE IN THE VALUE OF THE DOLLAR COULD INCREASE THE REAL COST TO OUR CUSTOMERS OF OUR PRODUCTS IN THOSE MARKETS OUTSIDE THE UNITED

STATES WHERE WE SELL IN DOLLARS, AND A WEAKENED DOLLAR COULD INCREASE THE COST OF LOCAL OPERATING EXPENSES AND PROCUREMENT OF RAW MATERIALS TO THE EXTENT WE MUST PURCHASE COMPONENTS IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES.

CURRENTLY, WE ENTER INTO FOREIGN EXCHANGE FORWARD CONTRACTS TO MINIMIZE THE SHORT-TERM IMPACT

OF FOREIGN CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS ON CERTAIN FOREIGN CURRENCY RECEIVABLES, INVESTMENTS, AND PAYABLES. IN ADDITION, WE PERIODICALLY HEDGE ANTICIPATED FOREIGN CURRENCY CASH FLOWS. OUR ATTEMPTS TO HEDGE AGAINST THESE RISKS MAY NOT BE SUCCESSFUL,

RESULTING IN AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR NET INCOME.

WE ARE EXPOSED TO THE

CREDIT RISK OF SOME OF OUR CUSTOMERS AND TO CREDIT EXPOSURES IN WEAKENED MARKETS, WHICH COULD RESULT IN MATERIAL LOSSES

MOST OF OUR SALES ARE ON AN OPEN CREDIT BASIS, WITH TYPICAL PAYMENT TERMS OF 30 DAYS IN THE UNITED STATES AND, BECAUSE OF LOCAL CUSTOMS OR CONDITIONS, LONGER IN SOME

MARKETS OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES. WE MONITOR INDIVIDUAL CUSTOMER PAYMENT CAPABILITY IN GRANTING SUCH OPEN CREDIT ARRANGEMENTS, SEEK TO LIMIT SUCH OPEN CREDIT TO AMOUNTS WE BELIEVE THE CUSTOMERS CAN PAY, AND MAINTAIN RESERVES WE BELIEVE ARE ADEQUATE

TO COVER EXPOSURE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS. BEYOND OUR OPEN CREDIT ARRANGEMENTS, WE HAVE ALSO EXPERIENCED DEMANDS FOR CUSTOMER FINANCING AND FACILITATION OF LEASING ARRANGEMENTS. WE EXPECT DEMAND FOR CUSTOMER FINANCING TO CONTINUE. WE BELIEVE CUSTOMER

FINANCING IS A COMPETITIVE FACTOR IN OBTAINING BUSINESS, PARTICULARLY IN SUPPLYING CUSTOMERS INVOLVED IN SIGNIFICANT INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS. OUR LOAN FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS MAY INCLUDE NOT ONLY FINANCING THE ACQUISITION OF OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES

BUT ALSO PROVIDING ADDITIONAL FUNDS FOR OTHER COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH NETWORK INSTALLATION AND INTEGRATION OF OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES AND FOR WORKING CAPITAL PURPOSES. WE DO NOT RECOGNIZE REVENUE ON STRUCTURED LOAN FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS UNTIL CASH

PAYMENTS ARE RECEIVED.

BECAUSE OF THE RECENT SLOWDOWN IN THE GLOBAL ECONOMY,

OUR EXPOSURE TO THE CREDIT RISKS RELATING TO OUR FINANCING ACTIVITIES DESCRIBED ABOVE MAY INCREASE. ALTHOUGH WE HAVE PROGRAMS IN PLACE THAT ARE DESIGNED TO MONITOR AND MITIGATE THE ASSOCIATED RISK, INCLUDING MONITORING OF PARTICULAR RISKS IN CERTAIN

GEOGRAPHIC AREAS, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT SUCH PROGRAMS WILL BE EFFECTIVE IN REDUCING OUR CREDIT RISKS. THERE HAVE BEEN SIGNIFICANT BANKRUPTCIES AMONG CUSTOMERS BOTH ON OPEN CREDIT AND WITH LOAN OR LEASE FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS, PARTICULARLY

AMONG INTERNET BUSINESSES AND SERVICE PROVIDERS, CAUSING US TO INCUR ECONOMIC OR FINANCIAL LOSSES. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT ADDITIONAL LOSSES WILL NOT BE INCURRED. ALTHOUGH THESE LOSSES HAVE NOT BEEN MATERIAL TO DATE, FUTURE LOSSES, IF

INCURRED, COULD HARM OUR BUSINESS AND HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR OPERATING RESULTS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

A PORTION OF OUR SALES IS DERIVED THROUGH OUR DISTRIBUTORS AND RETAIL PARTNERS. THESE DISTRIBUTORS AND RETAIL PARTNERS ARE GENERALLY GIVEN BUSINESS TERMS WHICH ALLOW THEM

TO RETURN A PORTION OF INVENTORY, RECEIVE CREDITS FOR CHANGES IN SELLING PRICES, AND PARTICIPATE IN VARIOUS COOPERATIVE MARKETING PROGRAMS. WE MAINTAIN ESTIMATED ACCRUALS AND ALLOWANCES FOR SUCH BUSINESS TERMS. HOWEVER, DISTRIBUTORS TEND TO HAVE

MORE LIMITED FINANCIAL RESOURCES THAN OTHER RESELLERS AND END-USER CUSTOMERS AND THEREFORE REPRESENT POTENTIAL SOURCES OF INCREASED CREDIT RISK BECAUSE THEY MAY BE MORE LIKELY TO LACK THE RESERVE RESOURCES TO MEET PAYMENT OBLIGATIONS.

OUR PROPRIETARY RIGHTS MAY PROVE DIFFICULT TO ENFORCE

WE GENERALLY RELY ON PATENTS, COPYRIGHTS, TRADEMARKS, AND TRADE SECRET LAWS TO ESTABLISH AND

MAINTAIN PROPRIETARY RIGHTS IN OUR TECHNOLOGY AND PRODUCTS. WHILE WE HAVE BEEN ISSUED NUMEROUS PATENTS, AND OTHER PATENT APPLICATIONS ARE CURRENTLY PENDING, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT ANY OF THESE PATENTS OR OTHER PROPRIETARY RIGHTS WILL NOT BE

CHALLENGED, INVALIDATED, OR CIRCUMVENTED OR THAT OUR RIGHTS WILL IN FACT PROVIDE COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGES TO US. FURTHERMORE, MANY KEY ASPECTS OF NETWORKING TECHNOLOGY ARE GOVERNED BY INDUSTRY-WIDE STANDARDS, WHICH ARE USABLE BY ALL MARKET ENTRANTS.

IN ADDITION, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT PATENTS WILL BE ISSUED FROM PENDING APPLICATIONS OR THAT CLAIMS ALLOWED ON ANY PATENTS WILL BE SUFFICIENTLY BROAD TO PROTECT OUR TECHNOLOGY. IN ADDITION, THE LAWS OF SOME FOREIGN COUNTRIES MAY NOT PROTECT

OUR PROPRIETARY RIGHTS TO THE SAME EXTENT AS DO THE LAWS OF THE UNITED STATES. THE OUTCOME OF ANY ACTIONS TAKEN IN THESE FOREIGN COUNTRIES MAY BE DIFFERENT THAN IF SUCH ACTIONS WERE DETERMINED UNDER THE LAWS OF THE UNITED STATES. WHILE WE ARE NOT

DEPENDENT ON ANY INDIVIDUAL PATENTS OR GROUP OF PATENTS FOR PARTICULAR SEGMENTS OF THE BUSINESS FOR WHICH WE COMPETE, IF WE ARE UNABLE TO PROTECT OUR PROPRIETARY RIGHTS TO THE TOTALITY OF THE FEATURES (INCLUDING ASPECTS OF PRODUCTS PROTECTED OTHER

THAN BY PATENT RIGHTS) IN A MARKET, WE MAY FIND OURSELVES AT A COMPETITIVE DISADVANTAGE TO OTHERS WHO NEED NOT INCUR THE SUBSTANTIAL EXPENSE, TIME, AND EFFORT REQUIRED TO CREATE THE INNOVATIVE PRODUCTS THAT HAVE ENABLED US TO BE SUCCESSFUL.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

WE MAY BE FOUND TO INFRINGE ON INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS OF OTHERS

THIRD PARTIES, INCLUDING CUSTOMERS, HAVE IN THE PAST AND MAY IN THE FUTURE ASSERT CLAIMS OR

INITIATE LITIGATION RELATED TO EXCLUSIVE PATENT, COPYRIGHT, TRADEMARK, AND OTHER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS TO TECHNOLOGIES AND RELATED STANDARDS THAT ARE RELEVANT TO US. THESE ASSERTIONS HAVE INCREASED OVER TIME AS A RESULT OF OUR GROWTH AND THE

GENERAL INCREASE IN THE PACE OF PATENT CLAIMS ASSERTIONS, PARTICULARLY IN THE UNITED STATES. BECAUSE OF THE EXISTENCE OF A LARGE NUMBER OF PATENTS IN THE NETWORKING FIELD, THE SECRECY OF SOME PENDING PATENTS, AND THE RAPID RATE OF ISSUANCE OF NEW

PATENTS, IT IS NOT ECONOMICALLY PRACTICAL OR EVEN POSSIBLE TO DETERMINE IN ADVANCE WHETHER A PRODUCT OR ANY OF ITS COMPONENTS INFRINGES OR WILL INFRINGE THE PATENT RIGHTS OF OTHERS. THE ASSERTED CLAIMS AND/OR INITIATED LITIGATION CAN INCLUDE CLAIMS

AGAINST US OR OUR MANUFACTURERS, SUPPLIERS, OR CUSTOMERS, ALLEGING INFRINGEMENT OF THEIR PROPRIETARY RIGHTS WITH RESPECT TO OUR EXISTING OR FUTURE PRODUCTS OR COMPONENTS OF THOSE PRODUCTS. REGARDLESS OF THE MERIT OF THESE CLAIMS, THEY CAN BE

TIME-CONSUMING, RESULT IN COSTLY LITIGATION AND DIVERSION OF TECHNICAL AND MANAGEMENT PERSONNEL, OR REQUIRE US TO DEVELOP A NONINFRINGING TECHNOLOGY OR ENTER INTO LICENSE AGREEMENTS. WHERE CLAIMS ARE MADE BY CUSTOMERS, RESISTANCE EVEN TO

UNMERITORIOUS CLAIMS COULD DAMAGE CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIPS. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT LICENSES WILL BE AVAILABLE ON ACCEPTABLE TERMS AND CONDITIONS, IF AT ALL, OR THAT OUR INDEMNIFICATION BY OUR SUPPLIERS WILL BE ADEQUATE TO COVER OUR COSTS IF A

CLAIM WERE BROUGHT DIRECTLY AGAINST US OR OUR CUSTOMERS. FURTHERMORE, BECAUSE OF THE POTENTIAL FOR HIGH COURT AWARDS THAT ARE NOT NECESSARILY PREDICTABLE, IT IS NOT UNUSUAL TO FIND EVEN ARGUABLY UNMERITORIOUS CLAIMS SETTLED FOR SIGNIFICANT AMOUNTS.

IF ANY INFRINGEMENT OR OTHER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY CLAIM MADE AGAINST US BY ANY THIRD PARTY IS SUCCESSFUL, OR IF WE FAIL TO DEVELOP NONINFRINGING TECHNOLOGY OR LICENSE THE PROPRIETARY RIGHTS ON COMMERCIALLY REASONABLE TERMS AND CONDITIONS, OUR

BUSINESS, OPERATING RESULTS, AND FINANCIAL CONDITION COULD BE MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

OUR EXPOSURE TO RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE USE OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY MAY BE INCREASED AS A RESULT OF ACQUISITIONS, AS WE HAVE A LOWER LEVEL OF VISIBILITY INTO THE DEVELOPMENT PROCESS WITH RESPECT TO SUCH TECHNOLOGY

OR THE CARE TAKEN TO SAFEGUARD AGAINST INFRINGEMENT RISKS. FURTHER, IN THE PAST, THIRD PARTIES HAVE MADE INFRINGEMENT AND SIMILAR CLAIMS AFTER WE HAVE ACQUIRED TECHNOLOGY THAT HAD NOT BEEN ASSERTED PRIOR TO OUR ACQUISITION.

WE RELY ON THE AVAILABILITY OF THIRD-PARTY LICENSES

MANY OF OUR PRODUCTS ARE DESIGNED TO INCLUDE SOFTWARE OR OTHER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

LICENSED FROM THIRD PARTIES. IT MAY BE NECESSARY IN THE FUTURE TO SEEK OR RENEW LICENSES RELATING TO VARIOUS ASPECTS OF THESE PRODUCTS. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THE NECESSARY LICENSES WOULD BE AVAILABLE ON ACCEPTABLE TERMS, IF AT ALL. THE

INABILITY TO OBTAIN CERTAIN LICENSES OR OTHER RIGHTS OR TO OBTAIN SUCH LICENSES OR RIGHTS ON FAVORABLE TERMS, OR THE NEED TO ENGAGE IN LITIGATION REGARDING THESE MATTERS, COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, OPERATING RESULTS, AND

FINANCIAL CONDITION. MOREOVER, THE INCLUSION IN OUR PRODUCTS OF SOFTWARE OR OTHER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY LICENSED FROM THIRD PARTIES ON A NONEXCLUSIVE BASIS COULD LIMIT OUR ABILITY TO PROTECT OUR PROPRIETARY RIGHTS IN OUR PRODUCTS.

OUR OPERATING RESULTS AND FUTURE PROSPECTS COULD BE MATERIALLY HARMED BY UNCERTAINTIES OF

REGULATION OF THE INTERNET

CURRENTLY, FEW LAWS OR REGULATIONS APPLY

DIRECTLY TO ACCESS OR COMMERCE ON THE INTERNET. WE COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY REGULATION OF THE INTERNET AND INTERNET COMMERCE IN ANY COUNTRY WHERE WE OPERATE. SUCH REGULATIONS COULD INCLUDE MATTERS SUCH AS VOICE OVER THE INTERNET OR

USING IP, ENCRYPTION TECHNOLOGY, SALES TAXES ON INTERNET PRODUCT SALES, AND ACCESS CHARGES FOR INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDERS. THE ADOPTION OF REGULATION OF THE INTERNET AND INTERNET COMMERCE COULD DECREASE DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS AND, AT THE SAME TIME,

INCREASE THE COST OF SELLING OUR PRODUCTS, WHICH COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, OPERATING RESULTS, AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

CHANGES IN TELECOMMUNICATIONS REGULATION AND TARIFFS COULD HARM OUR PROSPECTS AND FUTURE SALES

CHANGES IN TELECOMMUNICATIONS REQUIREMENTS IN THE UNITED STATES OR OTHER COUNTRIES COULD AFFECT THE SALES OF OUR PRODUCTS. IN PARTICULAR, WE

BELIEVE THAT THERE MAY BE FUTURE CHANGES IN U.S. TELECOMMUNICATIONS REGULATIONS THAT COULD SLOW THE EXPANSION OF THE SERVICE PROVIDERS NETWORK INFRASTRUCTURES AND MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, OPERATING RESULTS, AND FINANCIAL

CONDITION. FUTURE CHANGES IN TARIFFS BY REGULATORY AGENCIES OR APPLICATION OF TARIFF REQUIREMENTS TO CURRENTLY UNTARIFFED SERVICES COULD AFFECT THE SALES OF OUR PRODUCTS FOR CERTAIN CLASSES OF CUSTOMERS. ADDITIONALLY, IN THE UNITED STATES, OUR

PRODUCTS MUST COMPLY WITH VARIOUS FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION REQUIREMENTS AND REGULATIONS. IN COUNTRIES OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES, OUR PRODUCTS MUST MEET VARIOUS REQUIREMENTS OF LOCAL TELECOMMUNICATIONS AUTHORITIES. CHANGES IN TARIFFS OR

FAILURE BY US TO OBTAIN TIMELY APPROVAL OF PRODUCTS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, OPERATING RESULTS, AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

17

TABLE OF CONTENTS

FAILURE TO RETAIN AND RECRUIT KEY PERSONNEL WOULD HARM OUR ABILITY TO MEET KEY OBJECTIVES

OUR SUCCESS HAS ALWAYS DEPENDED IN LARGE PART ON OUR ABILITY TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN HIGHLY

SKILLED TECHNICAL, MANAGERIAL, SALES, AND MARKETING PERSONNEL. IN SPITE OF THE RECENT ECONOMIC SLOWDOWN, COMPETITION FOR THESE PERSONNEL IS INTENSE, ESPECIALLY IN THE SILICON VALLEY AREA OF NORTHERN CALIFORNIA. VOLATILITY OR LACK OF POSITIVE

PERFORMANCE IN OUR STOCK PRICE MAY ALSO ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO RETAIN KEY EMPLOYEES, VIRTUALLY ALL OF WHOM HAVE BEEN GRANTED STOCK OPTIONS. THE LOSS OF SERVICES OF ANY OF OUR KEY PERSONNEL, THE INABILITY TO RETAIN AND ATTRACT QUALIFIED

PERSONNEL IN THE FUTURE, OR DELAYS IN HIRING REQUIRED PERSONNEL, PARTICULARLY ENGINEERING AND SALES PERSONNEL, COULD MAKE IT DIFFICULT TO MEET KEY OBJECTIVES, SUCH AS TIMELY AND EFFECTIVE PRODUCT INTRODUCTIONS. IN ADDITION, COMPANIES IN THE

NETWORKING INDUSTRY WHOSE EMPLOYEES ACCEPT POSITIONS WITH COMPETITORS FREQUENTLY CLAIM THAT COMPETITORS HAVE ENGAGED IN IMPROPER HIRING PRACTICES. WE HAVE RECEIVED THESE CLAIMS IN THE PAST AND MAY RECEIVE ADDITIONAL CLAIMS TO THIS EFFECT IN THE

FUTURE.

ADVERSE RESOLUTION OF LITIGATION MAY HARM OUR OPERATING RESULTS OR

FINANCIAL CONDITION

WE ARE A PARTY TO LAWSUITS IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF

OUR BUSINESS. LITIGATION CAN BE EXPENSIVE, LENGTHY, AND DISRUPTIVE TO NORMAL BUSINESS OPERATIONS. MOREOVER, THE RESULTS OF COMPLEX LEGAL PROCEEDINGS ARE DIFFICULT TO PREDICT. AN UNFAVORABLE RESOLUTION OF A PARTICULAR LAWSUIT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL

ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, OPERATING RESULTS, OR FINANCIAL CONDITION. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING CERTAIN OF THE LAWSUITS IN WHICH WE ARE INVOLVED, SEE ITEM 3, LEGAL PROCEEDINGS, CONTAINED IN PART I OF THIS REPORT.

CHANGES IN EFFECTIVE TAX RATES OR ADVERSE OUTCOMES RESULTING FROM

EXAMINATION OF OUR INCOME TAX RETURNS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS

OUR FUTURE EFFECTIVE TAX RATES COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY EARNINGS BEING LOWER THAN ANTICIPATED IN COUNTRIES WHERE WE HAVE LOWER STATUTORY RATES AND HIGHER THAN ANTICIPATED IN COUNTRIES WHERE WE HAVE HIGHER STATUTORY RATES, BY CHANGES

IN THE VALUATION OF OUR DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, OR BY CHANGES IN TAX LAWS OR INTERPRETATIONS THEREOF. IN ADDITION, WE ARE SUBJECT TO THE CONTINUOUS EXAMINATION OF OUR INCOME TAX RETURNS BY THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE AND OTHER TAX

AUTHORITIES. WE REGULARLY ASSESS THE LIKELIHOOD OF ADVERSE OUTCOMES RESULTING FROM THESE EXAMINATIONS TO DETERMINE THE ADEQUACY OF OUR PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THE OUTCOMES FROM THESE CONTINUOUS EXAMINATIONS WILL

NOT HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR OPERATING RESULTS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

OUR BUSINESS AND OPERATIONS ARE ESPECIALLY SUBJECT TO THE RISKS OF EARTHQUAKES, FLOODS, AND OTHER NATURAL CATASTROPHIC EVENTS

OUR CORPORATE HEADQUARTERS, INCLUDING CERTAIN OF OUR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT OPERATIONS AND OUR MANUFACTURING FACILITIES, ARE LOCATED IN THE SILICON VALLEY AREA OF

NORTHERN CALIFORNIA, A REGION KNOWN FOR SEISMIC ACTIVITY. ADDITIONALLY, A CERTAIN NUMBER OF OUR FACILITIES, INCLUDING ONE OF OUR MANUFACTURING FACILITIES, ARE LOCATED NEAR RIVERS THAT HAVE EXPERIENCED FLOODING IN THE PAST. A SIGNIFICANT NATURAL

DISASTER, SUCH AS AN EARTHQUAKE OR A FLOOD, COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR BUSINESS, OPERATING RESULTS, AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

MANMADE PROBLEMS SUCH AS COMPUTER VIRUSES OR TERRORISM MAY DISRUPT OUR OPERATIONS AND HARM OUR OPERATING RESULTS

DESPITE OUR IMPLEMENTATION OF NETWORK SECURITY MEASURES, OUR SERVERS ARE VULNERABLE TO

COMPUTER VIRUSES, BREAK-INS, AND SIMILAR DISRUPTIONS FROM UNAUTHORIZED TAMPERING WITH OUR COMPUTER SYSTEMS. ANY SUCH EVENT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, OPERATING RESULTS, AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. IN ADDITION, THE CONTINUED

THREAT OF TERRORISM AND HEIGHTENED SECURITY AND MILITARY ACTION IN RESPONSE TO THIS THREAT, OR ANY FUTURE ACTS OF TERRORISM, MAY CAUSE FURTHER DISRUPTIONS TO THE ECONOMIES OF THE U.S. AND OTHER COUNTRIES AND CREATE FURTHER UNCERTAINTIES OR OTHERWISE

MATERIALLY HARM OUR BUSINESS, OPERATING RESULTS, AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. SIMILARLY, EVENTS SUCH AS THE BLACKOUTS IN THE EASTERN UNITED STATES, AND RECURRENCES OF THESE BLACKOUTS, COULD HAVE SIMILAR NEGATIVE IMPACTS. TO THE EXTENT THAT SUCH

DISRUPTIONS OR UNCERTAINTIES RESULT IN DELAYS OR CANCELLATIONS OF CUSTOMER ORDERS OR THE MANUFACTURE OR SHIPMENT OF OUR PRODUCTS, OUR BUSINESS, OPERATING RESULTS, AND FINANCIAL CONDITION COULD BE MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

WE ARE EXPOSED TO FLUCTUATIONS IN THE MARKET VALUES OF OUR PORTFOLIO INVESTMENTS AND IN

INTEREST RATES; IMPAIRMENT OF OUR INVESTMENTS COULD HARM OUR EARNINGS

WE

MAINTAIN AN INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO OF VARIOUS HOLDINGS, TYPES, AND MATURITIES. THESE SECURITIES ARE GENERALLY CLASSIFIED AS AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE AND, CONSEQUENTLY, ARE RECORDED ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS AT FAIR VALUE WITH UNREALIZED GAINS OR

LOSSES REPORTED AS A SEPARATE COMPONENT OF ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS), NET OF TAX. PART OF THIS PORTFOLIO INCLUDES EQUITY INVESTMENTS IN PUBLICLY TRADED COMPANIES, THE VALUES OF WHICH ARE SUBJECT TO MARKET PRICE VOLATILITY. THE

RECENT ECONOMIC DOWNTURN AND OTHER FACTORS HAVE ADVERSELY AFFECTED THE PUBLIC EQUITIES MARKET, AND GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS MAY WORSEN. AS A RESULT, WE MAY RECOGNIZE IN EARNINGS THE DECLINE IN FAIR VALUE OF OUR PUBLICLY TRADED EQUITY INVESTMENTS

BELOW THE COST BASIS WHEN THE DECLINE IS JUDGED TO BE OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY. FOR INFORMATION REGARDING THE SENSITIVITY OF AND RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE MARKET VALUE OF PORTFOLIO INVESTMENTS AND INTEREST RATES, REFER TO THE SECTION TITLED

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK IN OUR 2004 ANNUAL REPORT TO

18

TABLE OF CONTENTS

SHAREHOLDERS, WHICH IS INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE IN ITEM 7A OF THIS REPORT. OUR INVESTMENTS IN PRIVATE COMPANIES ARE

SUBJECT TO RISK OF LOSS OF INVESTMENT CAPITAL. THESE INVESTMENTS ARE INHERENTLY RISKY, AS THE MARKETS FOR THE TECHNOLOGIES OR PRODUCTS THEY HAVE UNDER DEVELOPMENT ARE TYPICALLY IN THE EARLY STAGES AND MAY NEVER MATERIALIZE. WE COULD LOSE OUR ENTIRE

INVESTMENT IN THESE COMPANIES.

IF WE DO NOT SUCCESSFULLY MANAGE OUR

STRATEGIC ALLIANCES, WE MAY EXPERIENCE INCREASED COMPETITION OR DELAYS IN PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT

WE HAVE SEVERAL STRATEGIC ALLIANCES WITH LARGE AND COMPLEX ORGANIZATIONS AND OTHER COMPANIES WITH WHOM WE WORK TO OFFER COMPLEMENTARY PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. THESE ARRANGEMENTS ARE GENERALLY LIMITED TO SPECIFIC

PROJECTS, THE GOAL OF WHICH IS GENERALLY TO FACILITATE PRODUCT COMPATIBILITY AND ADOPTION OF INDUSTRY STANDARDS. IF SUCCESSFUL, THESE RELATIONSHIPS MAY BE MUTUALLY BENEFICIAL AND RESULT IN INDUSTRY GROWTH. HOWEVER, THESE ALLIANCES CARRY AN ELEMENT

OF RISK BECAUSE, IN MOST CASES, WE MUST COMPETE IN SOME BUSINESS AREAS WITH A COMPANY WITH WHICH WE HAVE A STRATEGIC ALLIANCE AND, AT THE SAME TIME, COOPERATE WITH THAT COMPANY IN OTHER BUSINESS AREAS. ALSO, IF THESE COMPANIES FAIL TO PERFORM OR IF

THESE RELATIONSHIPS FAIL TO MATERIALIZE AS EXPECTED, WE COULD SUFFER DELAYS IN PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT OR OTHER OPERATIONAL DIFFICULTIES.

OUR STOCK PRICE MAY CONTINUE TO BE VOLATILE

OUR COMMON STOCK HAS EXPERIENCED SUBSTANTIAL PRICE VOLATILITY, PARTICULARLY AS A RESULT OF VARIATIONS BETWEEN OUR ACTUAL FINANCIAL RESULTS AND THE PUBLISHED EXPECTATIONS

OF ANALYSTS AND AS A RESULT OF ANNOUNCEMENTS BY OUR COMPETITORS AND US. FURTHERMORE, SPECULATION IN THE PRESS OR INVESTMENT COMMUNITY ABOUT OUR STRATEGIC POSITION, FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, BUSINESS, OR SIGNIFICANT TRANSACTIONS CAN

CAUSE CHANGES IN OUR STOCK PRICE. IN ADDITION, THE STOCK MARKET HAS EXPERIENCED EXTREME PRICE AND VOLUME FLUCTUATIONS THAT HAVE AFFECTED THE MARKET PRICE OF MANY TECHNOLOGY COMPANIES, IN PARTICULAR, AND THAT HAVE OFTEN BEEN UNRELATED TO THE

OPERATING PERFORMANCE OF THESE COMPANIES. THESE FACTORS, AS WELL AS GENERAL ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL CONDITIONS, MAY MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE MARKET PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK IN THE FUTURE. ADDITIONALLY, VOLATILITY OR A LACK OF POSITIVE

PERFORMANCE IN OUR STOCK PRICE MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO RETAIN KEY EMPLOYEES, ALL OF WHOM ARE COMPENSATED IN PART BASED ON THE PERFORMANCE OF OUR STOCK PRICE.

ITEM 2. PROPERTIES

OUR HEADQUARTERS ARE LOCATED

ON AN OWNED SITE IN SAN JOSE, CALIFORNIA. IN ADDITION TO THIS SITE, WE OWN CERTAIN SITES IN THE UNITED STATES, WHICH INCLUDE FACILITIES IN THE SURROUNDING AREAS OF SAN JOSE, CALIFORNIA; BOXBOROUGH, MASSACHUSETTS; SALEM, NEW HAMPSHIRE; RICHARDSON,

TEXAS; AND RESEARCH TRIANGLE PARK, NORTH CAROLINA. WE ALSO OWN LAND FOR EXPANSION IN SOME OF THESE LOCATIONS. IN ADDITION, WE ALSO LEASE OFFICE SPACE IN SEVERAL U.S. LOCATIONS.

OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES, WE HAVE OPERATIONS, PRIMARILY IN LEASED SITES, IN THE AMERICAS, EMEA, ASIA PACIFIC, AND JAPAN. LARGER SITE

LOCATIONS INCLUDE THE UNITED KINGDOM, FRANCE, BELGIUM, THE NETHERLANDS, SINGAPORE, HONG KONG, AUSTRALIA, JAPAN, AND INDIA. WE OWN AND LEASE MANUFACTURING FACILITIES, WHICH ARE PRIMARILY TEST AND ASSEMBLY OPERATIONS, IN TWO LOCATIONS IN THE UNITED

STATES AND NONE INTERNATIONALLY. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR EXISTING PROPERTIES, INCLUDING BOTH OWNED AND LEASED SITES, ARE IN GOOD CONDITION AND SUITABLE FOR THE CONDUCT OF OUR BUSINESS.

FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING OBLIGATIONS UNDER LEASES, SEE NOTE 8 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN OUR 2004 ANNUAL REPORT

TO SHAREHOLDERS, WHICH IS INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE HEREIN. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING PROPERTIES BY OPERATING SEGMENT, SEE NOTE 12 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN OUR 2004 ANNUAL REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS, WHICH IS INCORPORATED

ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

BEGINNING ON APRIL

20, 2001, A NUMBER OF PURPORTED SHAREHOLDER CLASS ACTION LAWSUITS WERE FILED IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA AGAINST US AND CERTAIN OF OUR OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS. THE LAWSUITS HAVE BEEN CONSOLIDATED, AND

THE CONSOLIDATED ACTION IS PURPORTEDLY BROUGHT ON BEHALF OF THOSE WHO PURCHASED OUR PUBLICLY TRADED SECURITIES BETWEEN AUGUST 10, 1999 AND FEBRUARY 6, 2001. PLAINTIFFS ALLEGE THAT DEFENDANTS MADE FALSE AND MISLEADING STATEMENTS, PURPORT TO ASSERT

CLAIMS FOR VIOLATIONS OF THE FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS, AND SEEK UNSPECIFIED COMPENSATORY DAMAGES AND OTHER RELIEF. WE BELIEVE THE CLAIMS ARE WITHOUT MERIT AND INTEND TO DEFEND THE ACTIONS VIGOROUSLY.

IN ADDITION, BEGINNING ON APRIL 23, 2001, A NUMBER OF PURPORTED SHAREHOLDER DERIVATIVE

LAWSUITS WERE FILED IN THE SUPERIOR COURT OF CALIFORNIA, COUNTY OF SANTA CLARA, AND IN THE SUPERIOR COURT OF CALIFORNIA, COUNTY OF SAN MATEO. THERE IS A PROCEDURE IN PLACE FOR THE COORDINATION OF SUCH ACTIONS (ONE OF WHICH HAS BEEN DISMISSED AND IS

CURRENTLY ON APPEAL). TWO PURPORTED DERIVATIVE SUITS WERE FILED IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA, AND THOSE FEDERAL COURT ACTIONS HAVE BEEN CONSOLIDATED. THE CONSOLIDATED FEDERAL COURT DERIVATIVE ACTION WAS

DISMISSED BY THE COURT, AND PLAINTIFFS HAVE APPEALED FROM THAT DECISION. THE COMPLAINTS IN THE VARIOUS DERIVATIVE ACTIONS INCLUDE CLAIMS FOR BREACH OF FIDUCIARY DUTY, WASTE OF CORPORATE ASSETS, MISMANAGEMENT, UNJUST ENRICHMENT, AND VIOLATIONS OF THE

CALIFORNIA CORPORATIONS CODE; SEEK COMPENSATORY AND OTHER DAMAGES, DISGORGEMENT, AND OTHER RELIEF; AND ARE BASED ON ESSENTIALLY THE SAME ALLEGATIONS AS THE CLASS ACTIONS.

IN ADDITION, WE ARE SUBJECT TO LEGAL PROCEEDINGS, CLAIMS, AND LITIGATION ARISING IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS. WHILE THE OUTCOME OF

THESE MATTERS IS CURRENTLY NOT DETERMINABLE, WE DO NOT EXPECT THAT THE ULTIMATE COSTS TO RESOLVE THESE MATTERS WILL HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL POSITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, OR CASH FLOWS.

ITEM 4. SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS
