PRODUCTS AND SERVICES

WE SELL INTERNET PROTOCOL (IP)-BASED NETWORKING AND OTHER PRODUCTS AND SERVICES RELATED

TO THE COMMUNICATIONS AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY INDUSTRY. OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES ARE DESIGNED TO ADDRESS A WIDE RANGE OF CUSTOMERS BUSINESS NEEDS, INCLUDING IMPROVING PRODUCTIVITY, REDUCING COSTS, AND GAINING A COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE. OUR

CORRESPONDING TECHNOLOGY FOCUS IS ON DELIVERING NETWORKING PRODUCTS AND SOLUTIONS THAT SIMPLIFY AND SECURE CUSTOMERS INFRASTRUCTURES AND OFFER INTEGRATED SERVICES. OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES HELP CUSTOMERS BUILD THEIR OWN NETWORK

INFRASTRUCTURES THAT SUPPORT TOOLS AND APPLICATIONS THAT ALLOW THEM TO COMMUNICATE WITH KEY STAKEHOLDERS, INCLUDING CUSTOMERS, PROSPECTS, BUSINESS PARTNERS, SUPPLIERS, AND EMPLOYEES. OUR PRODUCT OFFERINGS FALL INTO SEVERAL CATEGORIES: OUR CORE

TABLE OF CONTENTS

WE BELIEVE SOME OF OUR ADVANCED TECHNOLOGIES MAY CONTINUE TO GROW OVER TIME TO BECOME MATERIAL

CONTRIBUTORS TO OUR OVERALL BUSINESS. EACH OF OUR ADVANCED TECHNOLOGIES, IN ADDITION TO OUR CORE SWITCHING AND ROUTING BUSINESSES, BUILDS UPON OUR EXISTING COMPETENCIES AND ALLOWS US TO EXPAND THE OVERALL MARKET FOR OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. WE

HAVE CURRENTLY IDENTIFIED THE FOLLOWING ADVANCED TECHNOLOGIES: APPLICATION NETWORKING SERVICES, HOME NETWORKING, HOSTED SMALL-BUSINESS SYSTEMS, SECURITY, STORAGE AREA NETWORKING, UNIFIED COMMUNICATIONS, VIDEO SYSTEMS AND WIRELESS TECHNOLOGY. WE ARE

IN THE PROCESS OF IDENTIFYING ADDITIONAL ADVANCED TECHNOLOGIES FOR FOCUS AND INVESTMENT IN THE FUTURE, AND OUR INVESTMENTS IN SOME PRESENTLY IDENTIFIED ADVANCED TECHNOLOGIES MAY BE CURTAILED OR ELIMINATED DEPENDING ON MARKET DEVELOPMENTS. BEGINNING

IN FISCAL 2007, OUR SALES OF OPTICAL NETWORKING PRODUCTS ARE NO LONGER INCLUDED IN OUR ADVANCED TECHNOLOGIES PRODUCT CATEGORY AND INSTEAD ARE INCLUDED IN THE OTHER PRODUCT CATEGORY. PRIOR FISCAL YEARS HAVE BEEN RECLASSIFIED TO REFLECT THIS CHANGE.

WE HAVE ALSO CONTINUED TO FOCUS ON DEVELOPING A NEW WAVE OF TECHNOLOGIES, WHICH WE REFER TO AS EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES, INCLUDING SUCH PRODUCTS AS DIGITAL MEDIA, TELEPRESENCE, AND PHYSICAL SECURITY, AMONG OTHERS.

THE INVESTMENTS WE HAVE MADE AND OUR ARCHITECTURAL APPROACH ARE BASED ON THE BELIEF THAT COLLABORATION AND WEB 2.0, THE TECHNOLOGIES THAT

ENABLE USER COLLABORATION, INCLUDING SUCH TECHNOLOGIES AS UNIFIED COMMUNICATIONS AND TELEPRESENCE, AND THE INCREASED USE OF THE NETWORK AS THE PLATFORM FOR ALL FORMS OF COMMUNICATIONS AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY WILL CREATE NEW MARKET OPPORTUNITIES

FOR US. AS PART OF THE SECOND MAJOR PHASE OF THE INTERNET, WE BELIEVE THE INDUSTRY IS EVOLVING AS BOTH PERSONAL AND BUSINESS PROCESS COLLABORATION AND WEB 2.0 HELP TO INCREASE INNOVATION AND PRODUCTIVITY. WITH THE ACQUISITION OF SCIENTIFIC-ATLANTA

IN FEBRUARY 2006, WE ENHANCED OUR VIDEO CAPABILITIES TO HELP ENABLE THE CONVERGENCE OF DATA, VOICE AND VIDEO TECHNOLOGIES. IN ADDITION, WE SEEK TO FORM AND STRENGTHEN STRATEGIC BUSINESS RELATIONSHIPS WITH KEY SERVICE PROVIDER CUSTOMERS, AND TO REACH

A BROAD RANGE OF CONSUMERS WITH OUR ENHANCED PRODUCT LINE AS A RESULT OF THIS ACQUISITION. WE BELIEVE THAT VIDEO APPLICATIONS, SUCH AS OUR UNIFIED COMMUNICATIONS AND TELEPRESENCE PRODUCTS, HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO ACCELERATE THE GROWTH OF BANDWIDTH

DEMANDS AND TO INCREASE LOADS ON NETWORKS, WHICH MAY REQUIRE UPGRADES TO EXISTING NETWORKS.

MANY OF OUR STRATEGIC INITIATIVES AND

INVESTMENTS ARE ALSO BASED ON OUR VISION OF THE EVOLUTION OF THE NETWORK. OVER TIME, WE BELIEVE THAT THE INTERNET AND THE VARIOUS NETWORKS ASSOCIATED WITH IT, INCLUDING CORPORATE INTRANETS; CABLE, BROADBAND AND DIALUP NETWORKS; AND VOICE AND VIDEO

NETWORKS, WILL EVOLVE TO INCLUDE EMBEDDED RESOURCES AND THE VIRTUALIZATION OF APPLICATIONS AND SERVICES TO PRODUCE AN INTEGRATED, INTELLIGENT SYSTEM. THIS IS OUR VISION FOR THE EVOLUTION OF NETWORKING FROM CONNECTIVITY PRODUCTS TO INTELLIGENT

SYSTEMS. IN THIS EVOLVING ENVIRONMENT, WE BELIEVE SUCCESSFUL VENDORS WILL BE CAPABLE OF PROVIDING A BROAD SPECTRUM OF PRODUCTS AIMED NOT AT A PARTICULAR TECHNOLOGY PLATFORM BUT AT SOLUTIONS TO NETWORKING PROBLEMS THAT SPAN ALL SEGMENTS. AS SUCH, WE

AIM MANY OF OUR STRATEGIC INITIATIVES AND INVESTMENTS AT MEETING THE REQUIREMENTS THAT AN INTELLIGENT NETWORK WOULD DEMAND, MAKING THE NETWORK THE PLATFORM FOR THE NEXT GENERATION OF VALUE-ADDED COMMUNICATIONS. FOR A DISCUSSION OF THE RISKS

ASSOCIATED WITH THAT STRATEGY, PLEASE SEE ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS, INCLUDING THE RISK FACTOR ENTITLED WE DEPEND UPON THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW PRODUCTS AND ENHANCEMENTS TO EXISTING PRODUCTS, AND IF WE FAIL TO PREDICT AND RESPOND TO

EMERGING TECHNOLOGICAL TRENDS AND CUSTOMERS CHANGING NEEDS, OUR OPERATING RESULTS AND MARKET SHARE MAY SUFFER. FOR INFORMATION REGARDING SALES OF OUR MAJOR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, SEE NOTE 12 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN

OUR 2007 ANNUAL REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS, WHICH NOTE IS INCORPORATED INTO THIS REPORT BY REFERENCE.

CONSUMER

CONSUMER CUSTOMERS,

PRIMARILY INDIVIDUALS AND BUSINESSES OPERATING IN SMALL OFFICES OR HOME OFFICES, HAVE INFRASTRUCTURE AND NETWORKING NEEDS ON A SMALLER SCALE.

SALES OVERVIEW

FOR INFORMATION REGARDING RISKS RELATED TO OUR CHANNELS, PLEASE SEE ITEM

1A. RISK FACTORS, INCLUDING THE RISK FACTORS ENTITLED DISRUPTION OF OR CHANGES IN OUR DISTRIBUTION MODEL COULD HARM OUR SALES AND MARGINS AND OUR INVENTORY MANAGEMENT RELATING TO OUR SALES TO OUR TWO-TIER DISTRIBUTION CHANNEL

IS COMPLEX, AND EXCESS INVENTORY MAY HARM OUR GROSS MARGINS.

FOR INFORMATION REGARDING RISKS RELATING TO OUR INTERNATIONAL

OPERATIONS, PLEASE SEE ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS, INCLUDING THE RISK FACTORS ENTITLED OUR OPERATING RESULTS MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY UNFAVORABLE ECONOMIC AND MARKET CONDITIONS AND THE UNCERTAIN GEOPOLITICAL ENVIRONMENT,

BACKLOG

OUR BACKLOG AT JULY 28, 2007, THE LAST DAY OF OUR 2007 FISCAL YEAR, WAS APPROXIMATELY $3.9

BILLION, COMPARED WITH BACKLOG OF APPROXIMATELY $3.0 BILLION AT JULY 29, 2006, THE LAST DAY OF OUR 2006 FISCAL YEAR. BACKLOG INCLUDES ORDERS CONFIRMED FOR PRODUCTS SCHEDULED TO BE SHIPPED WITHIN 90 DAYS TO CUSTOMERS WITH APPROVED CREDIT STATUS.

BECAUSE OF THE GENERALLY SHORT CYCLE BETWEEN ORDER AND SHIPMENT AND OCCASIONAL CUSTOMER CHANGES IN DELIVERY SCHEDULES OR CANCELLATION OF ORDERS (WHICH ARE MADE WITHOUT SIGNIFICANT PENALTY), WE DO NOT BELIEVE THAT OUR BACKLOG, AS OF ANY PARTICULAR

DATE, IS NECESSARILY INDICATIVE OF ACTUAL NET SALES FOR ANY FUTURE PERIOD.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

ACQUISITIONS, INVESTMENTS, AND ALLIANCES

THE MARKETS IN WHICH WE COMPETE REQUIRE A WIDE VARIETY OF

TECHNOLOGIES, PRODUCTS, AND CAPABILITIES. THE COMBINATION OF TECHNOLOGICAL COMPLEXITY AND RAPID CHANGE WITHIN OUR MARKETS MAKES IT DIFFICULT FOR A SINGLE COMPANY TO DEVELOP ALL THE TECHNOLOGICAL SOLUTIONS THAT IT DESIRES TO OFFER WITHIN ITS FAMILY

OF PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. THROUGH ACQUISITIONS, INVESTMENTS, AND ALLIANCES WE ARE ABLE TO DELIVER A BROADER RANGE OF PRODUCTS AND SERVICES TO CUSTOMERS IN TARGET MARKETS.

WE EMPLOY THE FOLLOWING STRATEGIES TO ADDRESS THE NEED FOR NEW OR ENHANCED NETWORKING PRODUCTS AND SERVICES: WE DEVELOP NEW TECHNOLOGIES AND PRODUCTS INTERNALLY; WE ENTER INTO JOINT-DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS WITH OTHER

COMPANIES; WE RESELL OTHER COMPANIES PRODUCTS; AND WE ACQUIRE ALL OR PARTS OF OTHER COMPANIES.

ACQUISITIONS

WE HAVE ACQUIRED MANY COMPANIES, AND WE EXPECT TO MAKE FUTURE ACQUISITIONS. MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS OF HIGH-TECHNOLOGY COMPANIES

ARE INHERENTLY RISKY, ESPECIALLY IF THE ACQUIRED COMPANY HAS YET TO SHIP A PRODUCT. NO ASSURANCE CAN BE GIVEN THAT OUR PREVIOUS OR FUTURE ACQUISITIONS WILL BE SUCCESSFUL OR WILL NOT MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION OR OPERATING

RESULTS. PRIOR ACQUISITIONS HAVE RESULTED IN A WIDE RANGE OF OUTCOMES, FROM SUCCESSFUL INTRODUCTION OF NEW PRODUCTS AND TECHNOLOGIES TO AN INABILITY TO DO SO. THE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH ACQUISITIONS ARE MORE FULLY DISCUSSED IN ITEM 1A. RISK

FACTORS, INCLUDING THE RISK FACTOR ENTITLED WE HAVE MADE AND EXPECT TO CONTINUE TO MAKE ACQUISITIONS THAT COULD DISRUPT OUR OPERATIONS AND HARM OUR OPERATING RESULTS.

INVESTMENTS IN PRIVATELY HELD COMPANIES

WE MAKE INVESTMENTS IN PRIVATELY HELD COMPANIES THAT DEVELOP TECHNOLOGY OR PROVIDE SERVICES THAT ARE COMPLEMENTARY TO OUR PRODUCTS OR PROVIDE STRATEGIC VALUE. THE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THESE INVESTMENTS ARE MORE FULLY

DISCUSSED IN ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS, INCLUDING THE RISK FACTOR ENTITLED WE ARE EXPOSED TO FLUCTUATIONS IN THE MARKET VALUES OF OUR PORTFOLIO INVESTMENTS AND IN INTEREST RATES; IMPAIRMENT OF OUR INVESTMENTS COULD HARM OUR

EARNINGS.

STRATEGIC ALLIANCES

WE PURSUE STRATEGIC ALLIANCES WITH OTHER COMPANIES IN AREAS WHERE COLLABORATION CAN PRODUCE INDUSTRY ADVANCEMENT AND ACCELERATION OF NEW MARKETS. THE OBJECTIVES AND GOALS FOR A STRATEGIC ALLIANCE CAN INCLUDE ONE OR

MORE OF THE FOLLOWING: TECHNOLOGY EXCHANGE, PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT, JOINT SALES AND MARKETING, OR NEW-MARKET CREATION. CURRENTLY, WE HAVE STRATEGIC ALLIANCES WITH ACCENTURE LTD; AT&T INC.; BEARINGPOINT, INC.; CAP GEMINI S.A.; ELECTRONIC DATA

SYSTEMS CORPORATION; EMC CORPORATION; FUJITSU LIMITED; HEWLETT-PACKARD COMPANY; INTEL CORPORATION; INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS MACHINES CORPORATION; ITALTEL SPA; MICROSOFT CORPORATION; NOKIA; NOKIA SIEMENS NETWORKS; SIEMENS AG; SITRONICS TELECOM

SOLUTIONS, CZECH REPUBLIC A.S.; SPRINT NEXTEL CORPORATION; AND WIPRO LIMITED; AMONG OTHERS. COMPANIES WITH WHOM WE HAVE STRATEGIC ALLIANCES IN SOME AREAS MAY BE COMPETITORS IN OTHER AREAS. THE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR STRATEGIC ALLIANCES ARE MORE

FULLY DISCUSSED IN ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS, INCLUDING THE RISK FACTOR ENTITLED IF WE DO NOT SUCCESSFULLY MANAGE OUR STRATEGIC ALLIANCES, WE MAY EXPERIENCE INCREASED COMPETITION OR DELAYS IN PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT.

COMPETITION

WE COMPETE IN THE NETWORKING AND COMMUNICATIONS EQUIPMENT MARKETS, PROVIDING PRODUCTS AND SERVICES

FOR TRANSPORTING DATA, VOICE, AND VIDEO TRAFFIC ACROSS INTRANETS, EXTRANETS, AND THE INTERNET. THESE MARKETS ARE CHARACTERIZED BY RAPID CHANGE, CONVERGING TECHNOLOGIES, AND A MIGRATION TO NETWORKING SOLUTIONS THAT OFFER SUPERIOR ADVANTAGES. THESE

MARKET FACTORS REPRESENT BOTH AN OPPORTUNITY AND A COMPETITIVE THREAT TO US. WE COMPETE WITH NUMEROUS VENDORS IN EACH PRODUCT CATEGORY. THE OVERALL NUMBER OF OUR COMPETITORS PROVIDING NICHE PRODUCT SOLUTIONS MAY INCREASE. ALSO, THE IDENTITY AND

COMPOSITION OF COMPETITORS MAY CHANGE AS WE INCREASE OUR ACTIVITY IN OUR ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY MARKETS. AS WE CONTINUE TO EXPAND GLOBALLY, WE MAY SEE NEW COMPETITION IN DIFFERENT GEOGRAPHIC REGIONS. IN PARTICULAR, WE HAVE EXPERIENCED PRICE-FOCUSED

COMPETITION FROM COMPETITORS IN ASIA, ESPECIALLY CHINA, AND WE ANTICIPATE THIS WILL CONTINUE. COMPANIES WITH WHOM WE COMPETE IN SOME AREAS WE MAY ALSO HAVE STRATEGIC ALLIANCES WITH IN OTHER AREAS.

OUR COMPETITORS INCLUDE: ALCATEL-LUCENT; ARRIS GROUP, INC.; ARUBA NETWORKS, INC.; AVAYA INC.; BROCADE COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEMS, INC.; CHECK POINT SOFTWARE

TECHNOLOGIES LTD.; D-LINK CORPORATION; LM ERICSSON TELEPHONE COMPANY; EXTREME NETWORKS, INC.; F5 NETWORKS, INC.; FORCE10 NETWORKS, INC.; FORTINET INC.; FOUNDRY NETWORKS INC.; HEWLETT-PACKARD COMPANY; HUAWEI TECHNOLOGIES CO., LTD; INTERNATIONAL

BUSINESS MACHINES CORPORATION; JUNIPER NETWORKS, INC.; MERU NETWORKS, INC.; MICROSOFT CORPORATION; MOTOROLA, INC.; NETGEAR, INC.; NORTEL NETWORKS CORPORATION; RIVERBED TECHNOLOGY, INC.; SYMANTEC CORPORATION; AND TRAPEZE NETWORKS, INC., AMONG OTHERS.

SOME OF THESE COMPANIES COMPETE ACROSS MULTIPLE PRODUCT LINES, WHILE OTHERS ARE PRIMARILY FOCUSED IN A SPECIFIC PRODUCT AREA. BARRIERS TO

ENTRY ARE RELATIVELY LOW, AND NEW VENTURES TO CREATE PRODUCTS THAT DO OR COULD COMPETE WITH OUR PRODUCTS ARE REGULARLY FORMED. IN ADDITION, SOME OF OUR COMPETITORS MAY HAVE GREATER RESOURCES, INCLUDING TECHNICAL AND ENGINEERING RESOURCES,

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THAN WE DO. AS WE EXPAND INTO NEW MARKETS, WE WILL FACE COMPETITION NOT ONLY FROM OUR EXISTING COMPETITORS BUT ALSO FROM OTHER COMPETITORS, INCLUDING

EXISTING COMPANIES WITH STRONG TECHNOLOGICAL, MARKETING, AND SALES POSITIONS IN THOSE MARKETS. WE ALSO SOMETIMES FACE COMPETITION FROM RESELLERS AND DISTRIBUTORS OF OUR PRODUCTS.

THE PRINCIPAL COMPETITIVE FACTORS IN THE MARKETS IN WHICH WE PRESENTLY COMPETE AND MAY COMPETE IN THE FUTURE INCLUDE.



THE ABILITY TO PROVIDE A BROAD RANGE OF NETWORKING PRODUCTS AND SERVICES



PRODUCT PERFORMANCE



PRICE



THE ABILITY TO INTRODUCE NEW PRODUCTS, INCLUDING PRODUCTS WITH PRICE-PERFORMANCE ADVANTAGES



THE ABILITY TO REDUCE PRODUCTION COSTS



THE ABILITY TO PROVIDE VALUE-ADDED FEATURES SUCH AS SECURITY, RELIABILITY, AND INVESTMENT PROTECTION



CONFORMANCE TO STANDARDS



MARKET PRESENCE



THE ABILITY TO PROVIDE FINANCING

WE

ALSO FACE COMPETITION FROM CUSTOMERS TO WHOM WE LICENSE OR SUPPLY TECHNOLOGY AND SUPPLIERS FROM WHOM WE TRANSFER TECHNOLOGY. THE INHERENT NATURE OF NETWORKING REQUIRES INTEROPERABILITY. AS SUCH, WE MUST COOPERATE AND AT THE SAME TIME COMPETE WITH

MANY COMPANIES. ANY INABILITY TO EFFECTIVELY MANAGE THESE COMPLICATED RELATIONSHIPS WITH CUSTOMERS, SUPPLIERS, AND STRATEGIC ALLIANCE PARTNERS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, OPERATING RESULTS, AND FINANCIAL CONDITION AND

ACCORDINGLY AFFECT OUR CHANCES OF SUCCESS.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

WE REGULARLY SEEK TO INTRODUCE NEW PRODUCTS AND FEATURES IN AREAS INCLUDING ROUTERS,

SWITCHES, ADVANCED TECHNOLOGIES, AND OTHER PRODUCT TECHNOLOGIES. OUR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENDITURES WERE $4.5 BILLION, $4.1 BILLION, AND $3.3 BILLION IN FISCAL 2007, 2006, AND 2005, RESPECTIVELY. ALL OF OUR EXPENDITURES FOR RESEARCH AND

DEVELOPMENT COSTS, AS WELL AS IN-PROCESS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT OF $81 MILLION, $91 MILLION, AND $26 MILLION IN FISCAL 2007, 2006, AND 2005, RESPECTIVELY, HAVE BEEN EXPENSED AS INCURRED.

THE INDUSTRY IN WHICH WE COMPETE IS SUBJECT TO RAPID TECHNOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENTS, EVOLVING STANDARDS, CHANGES IN CUSTOMER REQUIREMENTS, AND NEW PRODUCT

INTRODUCTIONS AND ENHANCEMENTS. AS A RESULT, OUR SUCCESS DEPENDS IN PART UPON OUR ABILITY, ON A COST-EFFECTIVE AND TIMELY BASIS, TO CONTINUE TO ENHANCE OUR EXISTING PRODUCTS AND TO DEVELOP AND INTRODUCE NEW PRODUCTS THAT IMPROVE PERFORMANCE AND

REDUCE TOTAL COST OF OWNERSHIP. TO ACHIEVE THESE OBJECTIVES, OUR MANAGEMENT AND ENGINEERING PERSONNEL WORK WITH CUSTOMERS TO IDENTIFY AND RESPOND TO CUSTOMER NEEDS, AS WELL AS WITH OTHER INNOVATORS OF INTERNETWORKING PRODUCTS, INCLUDING

UNIVERSITIES, LABORATORIES, AND CORPORATIONS. WE ALSO EXPECT TO CONTINUE TO MAKE ACQUISITIONS AND INVESTMENTS WHERE APPROPRIATE TO PROVIDE US WITH ACCESS TO NEW TECHNOLOGIES. WE INTEND TO CONTINUE DEVELOPING PRODUCTS THAT MEET KEY INDUSTRY STANDARDS

AND TO SUPPORT IMPORTANT PROTOCOL STANDARDS AS THEY EMERGE. STILL, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY DEVELOP PRODUCTS TO ADDRESS NEW CUSTOMER REQUIREMENTS AND TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGES OR THAT SUCH PRODUCTS WILL ACHIEVE

MARKET ACCEPTANCE.

MANUFACTURING

WE PRIMARILY EMPLOY AN OUTSOURCED MANUFACTURING STRATEGY THAT RELIES ON CONTRACT MANUFACTURERS

FOR MANUFACTURING SERVICES, ALTHOUGH WE CONTINUE TO OPERATE THE SCIENTIFIC-ATLANTA MANUFACTURING FACILITIES ACQUIRED IN THE SCIENTIFIC-ATLANTA ACQUISITION, INCLUDING ITS PRINCIPAL FACILITY IN JUAREZ, MEXICO. SCIENTIFIC-ATLANTAS MANUFACTURING

OPERATIONS RANGE FROM AUTOMATED ASSEMBLY LINES FOR VOLUME PRODUCTION TO COMPLETE ASSEMBLY OF A PARTICULAR PRODUCT BY ONE INDIVIDUAL OR SMALL GROUP OF INDIVIDUALS. WE PRESENTLY USE A VARIETY OF INDEPENDENT THIRD-PARTY COMPANIES TO PROVIDE SERVICES

RELATED TO PRINTED CIRCUIT BOARD ASSEMBLY, IN-CIRCUIT TEST, AND PRODUCT REPAIR AS WELL AS PRODUCT ASSEMBLY. PROPRIETARY SOFTWARE ON ELECTRONICALLY PROGRAMMABLE MEMORY CHIPS IS USED TO CONFIGURE PRODUCTS TO CUSTOMER NEEDS AND TO MAINTAIN QUALITY

CONTROL AND SECURITY. THE MANUFACTURING PROCESS ENABLES US TO CONFIGURE THE HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE IN UNIQUE COMBINATIONS TO MEET A WIDE VARIETY OF INDIVIDUAL CUSTOMER REQUIREMENTS. THE MANUFACTURING PROCESS USES AUTOMATED TESTING EQUIPMENT AND

BURN-IN PROCEDURES, AS WELL AS COMPREHENSIVE INSPECTION, TESTING, AND

7

TABLE OF CONTENTS

STATISTICAL PROCESS CONTROLS THAT ARE DESIGNED TO HELP ENSURE THE QUALITY AND RELIABILITY OF OUR PRODUCTS. THE MANUFACTURING PROCESSES AND PROCEDURES ARE

GENERALLY CERTIFIED TO ISO 9001 OR ISO 9003 STANDARDS.

OUR ARRANGEMENTS WITH CONTRACT MANUFACTURERS GENERALLY PROVIDE FOR QUALITY, COST,

AND DELIVERY REQUIREMENTS, AS WELL AS MANUFACTURING PROCESS TERMS, SUCH AS CONTINUITY OF SUPPLY; INVENTORY MANAGEMENT; FLEXIBILITY REGARDING CAPACITY, QUALITY AND COST MANAGEMENT; OVERSIGHT OF MANUFACTURING; AND CONDITIONS FOR USE OF OUR

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY. IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF FISCAL 2007, WE FULLY IMPLEMENTED THE LEAN MANUFACTURING MODEL, WHICH WE BEGAN TRANSITIONING TO IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2006.

WE HAVE NOT ENTERED INTO ANY SIGNIFICANT LONG-TERM CONTRACTS WITH ANY MANUFACTURING SERVICE PROVIDER. WE GENERALLY HAVE THE OPTION TO RENEW ARRANGEMENTS

ON AN AS-NEEDED BASIS, PRIMARILY ANNUALLY. THESE ARRANGEMENTS GENERALLY DO NOT COMMIT US TO PURCHASE ANY PARTICULAR AMOUNT OR ANY QUANTITIES BEYOND CERTAIN AMOUNTS COVERED BY ORDERS OR FORECASTS THAT WE SUBMIT COVERING DISCRETE PERIODS OF TIME.

PATENTS, INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, AND LICENSING

WE SEEK TO ESTABLISH AND MAINTAIN OUR PROPRIETARY RIGHTS IN OUR

TECHNOLOGY AND PRODUCTS THROUGH THE USE OF PATENTS, COPYRIGHTS, TRADEMARKS, AND TRADE SECRET LAWS. WE HAVE A PROGRAM TO FILE APPLICATIONS FOR AND OBTAIN PATENTS, COPYRIGHTS, AND TRADEMARKS IN THE UNITED STATES AND IN SELECTED FOREIGN COUNTRIES WHERE

WE BELIEVE FILING FOR SUCH PROTECTION IS APPROPRIATE. WE ALSO SEEK TO MAINTAIN OUR TRADE SECRETS AND CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION BY NONDISCLOSURE POLICIES AND THROUGH THE USE OF APPROPRIATE CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENTS. WE HAVE OBTAINED A SUBSTANTIAL

NUMBER OF PATENTS AND TRADEMARKS IN THE UNITED STATES AND IN OTHER COUNTRIES. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE, HOWEVER, THAT THE RIGHTS OBTAINED CAN BE SUCCESSFULLY ENFORCED AGAINST INFRINGING PRODUCTS IN EVERY JURISDICTION. ALTHOUGH WE BELIEVE THE

PROTECTION AFFORDED BY OUR PATENTS, COPYRIGHTS, TRADEMARKS, AND TRADE SECRETS HAS VALUE, THE RAPIDLY CHANGING TECHNOLOGY IN THE NETWORKING INDUSTRY AND UNCERTAINTIES IN THE LEGAL PROCESS MAKE OUR FUTURE SUCCESS DEPENDENT PRIMARILY ON THE INNOVATIVE

SKILLS, TECHNOLOGICAL EXPERTISE, AND MANAGEMENT ABILITIES OF OUR EMPLOYEES RATHER THAN ON THE PROTECTION AFFORDED BY PATENT, COPYRIGHT, TRADEMARK, AND TRADE SECRET LAWS.

MANY OF OUR PRODUCTS ARE DESIGNED TO INCLUDE SOFTWARE OR OTHER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY LICENSED FROM THIRD PARTIES. WHILE IT MAY BE NECESSARY IN THE FUTURE TO SEEK OR RENEW LICENSES RELATING TO VARIOUS ASPECTS OF OUR

PRODUCTS, WE BELIEVE, BASED UPON PAST EXPERIENCE AND STANDARD INDUSTRY PRACTICE, THAT SUCH LICENSES GENERALLY COULD BE OBTAINED ON COMMERCIALLY REASONABLE TERMS. NONETHELESS, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THE NECESSARY LICENSES WOULD BE AVAILABLE

ON ACCEPTABLE TERMS, IF AT ALL. OUR INABILITY TO OBTAIN CERTAIN LICENSES OR OTHER RIGHTS OR TO OBTAIN SUCH LICENSES OR RIGHTS ON FAVORABLE TERMS, OR THE NEED TO ENGAGE IN LITIGATION REGARDING THESE MATTERS, COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON

OUR BUSINESS, OPERATING RESULTS, AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. MOREOVER, INCLUSION IN OUR PRODUCTS OF SOFTWARE OR OTHER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY LICENSED FROM THIRD PARTIES ON A NONEXCLUSIVE BASIS CAN LIMIT OUR ABILITY TO PROTECT OUR PROPRIETARY RIGHTS IN

OUR PRODUCTS.

THE INDUSTRY IN WHICH WE COMPETE IS CHARACTERIZED BY RAPIDLY CHANGING TECHNOLOGY, A LARGE NUMBER OF PATENTS, AND FREQUENT

CLAIMS AND RELATED LITIGATION REGARDING PATENT AND OTHER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT OUR PATENTS AND OTHER PROPRIETARY RIGHTS WILL NOT BE CHALLENGED, INVALIDATED, OR CIRCUMVENTED; THAT OTHERS WILL NOT ASSERT

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS TO TECHNOLOGIES THAT ARE RELEVANT TO US; OR THAT OUR RIGHTS WILL GIVE US A COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE. IN ADDITION, THE LAWS OF SOME FOREIGN COUNTRIES MAY NOT PROTECT OUR PROPRIETARY RIGHTS TO THE SAME EXTENT AS THE LAWS OF

THE UNITED STATES. THE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH PATENTS AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY ARE MORE FULLY DISCUSSED IN ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS, INCLUDING THE RISK FACTORS ENTITLED OUR PROPRIETARY RIGHTS MAY PROVE DIFFICULT TO ENFORCE,

WE MAY BE FOUND TO INFRINGE ON INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS OF OTHERS, AND WE RELY ON THE AVAILABILITY OF THIRD-PARTY LICENSES.

EMPLOYEES

AS OF JULY 28, 2007, WE EMPLOYED 61,535 EMPLOYEES, INCLUDING 16,227 IN MANUFACTURING AND

SERVICE, 18,410 IN ENGINEERING, 21,465 IN SALES AND MARKETING, AND 5,433 IN GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATION. APPROXIMATELY 26,500 EMPLOYEES ARE IN LOCATIONS OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES. WE CONSIDER THE RELATIONSHIPS WITH OUR EMPLOYEES TO BE POSITIVE.

COMPETITION FOR TECHNICAL PERSONNEL IN THE INDUSTRY IN WHICH WE COMPETE IS INTENSE. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR FUTURE SUCCESS DEPENDS IN PART ON OUR CONTINUED ABILITY TO HIRE, ASSIMILATE, AND RETAIN QUALIFIED PERSONNEL. TO DATE, WE BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE

BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN RECRUITING QUALIFIED EMPLOYEES, BUT THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL CONTINUE TO BE SUCCESSFUL IN THE FUTURE.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS

SET FORTH BELOW AND ELSEWHERE IN THIS REPORT AND IN OTHER DOCUMENTS WE FILE WITH

THE SEC ARE DESCRIPTIONS OF THE RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES THAT COULD CAUSE OUR ACTUAL RESULTS TO DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THE RESULTS CONTEMPLATED BY THE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS CONTAINED IN THIS REPORT.

OUR OPERATING RESULTS MAY FLUCTUATE IN FUTURE PERIODS, WHICH MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR STOCK PRICE

OUR OPERATING RESULTS HAVE BEEN IN THE PAST, AND WILL CONTINUE TO BE, SUBJECT TO QUARTERLY AND ANNUAL FLUCTUATIONS AS A RESULT OF NUMEROUS FACTORS. THESE

FACTORS INCLUDE.



FLUCTUATIONS IN DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, ESPECIALLY WITH RESPECT TO INTERNET BUSINESSES AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICE PROVIDERS, IN PART DUE TO

CHANGES IN THE GLOBAL ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT



CHANGES IN SALES AND IMPLEMENTATION CYCLES FOR OUR PRODUCTS AND REDUCED VISIBILITY INTO OUR CUSTOMERS SPENDING PLANS AND ASSOCIATED REVENUE



OUR ABILITY TO MAINTAIN APPROPRIATE INVENTORY LEVELS AND PURCHASE COMMITMENTS



PRICE AND PRODUCT COMPETITION IN THE COMMUNICATIONS AND NETWORKING INDUSTRIES, WHICH CAN CHANGE RAPIDLY DUE TO TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATION AND DIFFERENT BUSINESS

MODELS FROM VARIOUS GEOGRAPHIC REGIONS



THE OVERALL MOVEMENT TOWARD INDUSTRY CONSOLIDATION AMONG BOTH OUR COMPETITORS AND OUR CUSTOMERS



THE INTRODUCTION AND MARKET ACCEPTANCE OF NEW TECHNOLOGIES AND PRODUCTS AND OUR SUCCESS IN NEW MARKETS, INCLUDING EMERGING AND ADVANCED TECHNOLOGIES, AS WELL AS THE

ADOPTION OF NEW NETWORKING STANDARDS



VARIATIONS IN SALES CHANNELS, PRODUCT COSTS, OR MIX OF PRODUCTS SOLD



THE TIMING, SIZE, AND MIX OF ORDERS FROM CUSTOMERS



MANUFACTURING AND CUSTOMER LEAD TIMES



FLUCTUATIONS IN OUR GROSS MARGINS, AND THE FACTORS THAT CONTRIBUTE TO THIS AS DESCRIBED BELOW



OUR ABILITY TO ACHIEVE TARGETED COST REDUCTIONS



THE ABILITY OF OUR CUSTOMERS, CHANNEL PARTNERS, AND SUPPLIERS TO OBTAIN FINANCING OR TO FUND CAPITAL EXPENDITURES



THE TIMING AND AMOUNT OF EMPLOYER PAYROLL TAX TO BE PAID ON OUR EMPLOYEES GAINS ON STOCK OPTIONS EXERCISED



ACTUAL EVENTS, CIRCUMSTANCES, OUTCOMES, AND AMOUNTS DIFFERING FROM JUDGMENTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND ESTIMATES USED IN DETERMINING THE VALUES OF CERTAIN ASSETS (INCLUDING

THE AMOUNTS OF RELATED VALUATION ALLOWANCES), LIABILITIES, AND OTHER ITEMS REFLECTED IN OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS



HOW WELL WE EXECUTE ON OUR STRATEGY AND OPERATING PLANS



BENEFITS ANTICIPATED FROM OUR INVESTMENTS IN ENGINEERING, SALES AND MANUFACTURING ACTIVITIES



CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING RULES, SUCH AS RECORDING EXPENSES FOR EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTION GRANTS AND TAX ACCOUNTING, INCLUDING ACCOUNTING FOR UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS

AS A CONSEQUENCE, OPERATING RESULTS FOR A PARTICULAR FUTURE PERIOD ARE DIFFICULT TO PREDICT, AND, THEREFORE, PRIOR

RESULTS ARE NOT NECESSARILY INDICATIVE OF RESULTS TO BE EXPECTED IN FUTURE PERIODS. ANY OF THE FOREGOING FACTORS, OR ANY OTHER FACTORS DISCUSSED ELSEWHERE HEREIN, COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, AND

FINANCIAL CONDITION THAT COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR STOCK PRICE.

11

TABLE OF CONTENTS

OUR OPERATING RESULTS MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY UNFAVORABLE ECONOMIC AND MARKET CONDITIONS AND THE UNCERTAIN

GEOPOLITICAL ENVIRONMENT

ECONOMIC CONDITIONS WORLDWIDE HAVE FROM TIME TO TIME CONTRIBUTED TO SLOWDOWNS IN THE COMMUNICATIONS AND

NETWORKING INDUSTRIES AT LARGE, AS WELL AS TO SPECIFIC SEGMENTS AND MARKETS IN WHICH WE OPERATE, RESULTING IN.



REDUCED DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS AS A RESULT OF CONTINUED CONSTRAINTS ON INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY-RELATED CAPITAL SPENDING BY OUR CUSTOMERS, PARTICULARLY SERVICE

PROVIDERS, AND OTHER CUSTOMER MARKETS AS WELL



INCREASED PRICE COMPETITION FOR OUR PRODUCTS, NOT ONLY FROM OUR COMPETITORS BUT ALSO AS A CONSEQUENCE OF CUSTOMERS DISPOSING OF UNUTILIZED PRODUCTS



RISK OF EXCESS AND OBSOLETE INVENTORIES



EXCESS FACILITIES AND MANUFACTURING CAPACITY



HIGHER OVERHEAD COSTS AS A PERCENTAGE OF REVENUE AND HIGHER INTEREST EXPENSE

RECENT TURMOIL IN THE GEOPOLITICAL ENVIRONMENT IN MANY PARTS OF THE WORLD, INCLUDING TERRORIST ACTIVITIES AND MILITARY ACTIONS, PARTICULARLY THE

CONTINUING TENSION IN AND SURROUNDING IRAQ, AND CHANGES IN ENERGY COSTS MAY CONTINUE TO PUT PRESSURE ON GLOBAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS. OUR OPERATING RESULTS IN ONE OR MORE SEGMENTS MAY ALSO BE AFFECTED BY CHANGING ECONOMIC CONDITIONS PARTICULARLY

GERMANE TO THAT SEGMENT OR TO PARTICULAR CUSTOMER MARKETS WITHIN THAT SEGMENT. IF GLOBAL ECONOMIC AND MARKET CONDITIONS, OR ECONOMIC CONDITIONS IN THE UNITED STATES OR OTHER KEY MARKETS, DETERIORATE, WE MAY EXPERIENCE MATERIAL IMPACTS ON OUR

BUSINESS, OPERATING RESULTS, AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

OUR REVENUE FOR A PARTICULAR PERIOD IS DIFFICULT TO PREDICT, AND A SHORTFALL IN REVENUE MAY HARM

OUR OPERATING RESULTS

AS A RESULT OF A VARIETY OF FACTORS DISCUSSED IN THIS REPORT, OUR REVENUE FOR A PARTICULAR QUARTER IS DIFFICULT

TO PREDICT. OUR NET SALES MAY GROW AT A SLOWER RATE THAN IN PAST PERIODS, OR MAY DECLINE. OUR ABILITY TO MEET FINANCIAL EXPECTATIONS COULD ALSO BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED IF THE NONLINEAR SALES PATTERN SEEN IN SOME OF OUR PAST QUARTERS RECURS IN FUTURE

PERIODS. WE HAVE EXPERIENCED PERIODS OF TIME DURING WHICH SHIPMENTS HAVE EXCEEDED NET BOOKINGS, OR MANUFACTURING ISSUES HAVE DELAYED SHIPMENTS, LEADING TO NONLINEARITY IN SHIPPING PATTERNS. IN ADDITION TO MAKING IT DIFFICULT TO PREDICT REVENUE FOR A

PARTICULAR PERIOD, NONLINEARITY IN SHIPPING CAN INCREASE COSTS, BECAUSE IRREGULAR SHIPMENT PATTERNS RESULT IN PERIODS OF UNDERUTILIZED CAPACITY AND PERIODS IN WHICH OVERTIME EXPENSES MAY BE INCURRED, AS WELL AS LEADING TO ADDITIONAL COSTS ARISING

OUT OF INVENTORY MANAGEMENT. IN ADDITION, TO THE EXTENT THAT MANUFACTURING ISSUES AND ANY RELATED COMPONENT SHORTAGES RESULT IN DELAYED SHIPMENTS IN THE FUTURE, AND PARTICULARLY IN PERIODS IN WHICH WE AND OUR CONTRACT MANUFACTURERS ARE OPERATING AT

HIGHER LEVELS OF CAPACITY, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT REVENUE FOR A QUARTER COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED IF SUCH MATTERS OCCUR AND ARE NOT REMEDIATED WITHIN THE SAME QUARTER.

IN ADDITION, TO IMPROVE CUSTOMER SATISFACTION, WE CONTINUE TO ATTEMPT TO IMPROVE OUR MANUFACTURING LEAD-TIME PERFORMANCE, WHICH MAY RESULT IN CORRESPONDING REDUCTIONS IN ORDER BACKLOG. A DECLINE IN BACKLOG LEVELS

COULD RESULT IN MORE VARIABILITY AND LESS PREDICTABILITY IN OUR QUARTER-TO-QUARTER NET SALES AND OPERATING RESULTS. LONG MANUFACTURING LEAD TIMES HAVE CAUSED OUR CUSTOMERS IN THE PAST TO PLACE THE SAME ORDER MULTIPLE TIMES WITHIN OUR VARIOUS SALES

CHANNELS AND TO CANCEL THE DUPLICATIVE ORDERS UPON RECEIPT OF THE PRODUCT, OR TO PLACE ORDERS WITH OTHER VENDORS WITH SHORTER MANUFACTURING LEAD TIMES. SUCH MULTIPLE ORDERING (ALONG WITH OTHER FACTORS) MAY CAUSE DIFFICULTY IN PREDICTING OUR SALES

AND, AS A RESULT, COULD IMPAIR OUR ABILITY TO MANAGE PARTS INVENTORY EFFECTIVELY.

WE PLAN OUR OPERATING EXPENSE LEVELS BASED PRIMARILY ON

FORECASTED REVENUE LEVELS. THESE EXPENSES AND THE IMPACT OF LONG-TERM COMMITMENTS ARE RELATIVELY FIXED IN THE SHORT TERM. A SHORTFALL IN REVENUE COULD LEAD TO OPERATING RESULTS BEING BELOW EXPECTATIONS BECAUSE WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO QUICKLY REDUCE

THESE FIXED EXPENSES IN RESPONSE TO SHORT-TERM BUSINESS CHANGES.

ANY OF THE ABOVE FACTORS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR

OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL RESULTS.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

WE EXPECT GROSS MARGIN TO VARY OVER TIME, AND OUR LEVEL OF PRODUCT GROSS MARGIN MAY NOT BE SUSTAINABLE

OUR LEVEL OF PRODUCT GROSS MARGINS MAY NOT BE SUSTAINABLE AND MAY CONTINUE TO BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY NUMEROUS FACTORS, INCLUDING.



CHANGES IN CUSTOMER, GEOGRAPHIC, OR PRODUCT MIX, INCLUDING MIX OF CONFIGURATIONS WITHIN EACH PRODUCT GROUP



INTRODUCTION OF NEW PRODUCTS, INCLUDING PRODUCTS WITH PRICE-PERFORMANCE ADVANTAGES



OUR ABILITY TO REDUCE PRODUCTION COSTS



ENTRY INTO NEW MARKETS, INCLUDING MARKETS WITH DIFFERENT PRICING AND COST STRUCTURES, THROUGH ACQUISITIONS, SUCH AS OUR ACQUISITION OF SCIENTIFIC-ATLANTA, OR

INTERNAL DEVELOPMENT



SALES DISCOUNTS



INCREASES IN MATERIAL OR LABOR COSTS



EXCESS INVENTORY AND INVENTORY HOLDING CHARGES



OBSOLESCENCE CHARGES



CHANGES IN SHIPMENT VOLUME



LOSS OF COST SAVINGS DUE TO CHANGES IN COMPONENT PRICING OR CHARGES INCURRED DUE TO INVENTORY HOLDING PERIODS IF PARTS ORDERING DOES NOT CORRECTLY ANTICIPATE

PRODUCT DEMAND



LOWER THAN EXPECTED BENEFITS FROM VALUE ENGINEERING



INCREASED PRICE COMPETITION, INCLUDING COMPETITORS FROM ASIA, ESPECIALLY CHINA



CHANGES IN DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS



INCREASED WARRANTY COSTS



HOW WELL WE EXECUTE ON OUR STRATEGY AND OPERATING PLANS

CHANGES IN SERVICE GROSS MARGIN MAY RESULT FROM VARIOUS FACTORS SUCH AS CHANGES IN THE MIX BETWEEN TECHNICAL SUPPORT SERVICES AND ADVANCED SERVICES, AS WELL AS THE TIMING OF TECHNICAL SUPPORT SERVICE CONTRACT

INITIATIONS AND RENEWALS AND THE ADDITION OF PERSONNEL AND OTHER RESOURCES TO SUPPORT HIGHER LEVELS OF SERVICE BUSINESS IN FUTURE PERIODS.

DISRUPTION

OF OR CHANGES IN OUR DISTRIBUTION MODEL COULD HARM OUR SALES AND MARGINS

IF WE FAIL TO MANAGE DISTRIBUTION OF OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES

PROPERLY, OR IF OUR DISTRIBUTORS FINANCIAL CONDITION OR OPERATIONS WEAKEN, OUR REVENUE AND GROSS MARGINS COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES IS SOLD THROUGH OUR CHANNEL PARTNERS AND THE REMAINDER IS SOLD THROUGH DIRECT SALES. OUR CHANNEL PARTNERS INCLUDE SYSTEMS INTEGRATORS, SERVICE PROVIDERS, OTHER RESELLERS, DISTRIBUTORS, AND

RETAIL PARTNERS. SYSTEMS INTEGRATORS AND SERVICE PROVIDERS TYPICALLY SELL DIRECTLY TO END USERS AND OFTEN PROVIDE SYSTEM INSTALLATION, TECHNICAL SUPPORT, PROFESSIONAL SERVICES, AND OTHER SUPPORT SERVICES IN ADDITION TO NETWORK EQUIPMENT SALES.

SYSTEMS INTEGRATORS ALSO TYPICALLY INTEGRATE OUR PRODUCTS INTO AN OVERALL SOLUTION, AND A NUMBER OF SERVICE PROVIDERS ARE ALSO SYSTEMS INTEGRATORS. DISTRIBUTORS STOCK INVENTORY AND TYPICALLY SELL TO SYSTEMS INTEGRATORS, SERVICE PROVIDERS, AND OTHER

RESELLERS. IN ADDITION, HOME NETWORKING PRODUCTS ARE GENERALLY SOLD THROUGH DISTRIBUTORS AND RETAIL PARTNERS. WE REFER TO SALES THROUGH DISTRIBUTORS AND RETAIL PARTNERS AS OUR TWO-TIER SYSTEM OF SALES TO THE END CUSTOMER. REVENUE FROM DISTRIBUTORS

AND RETAIL PARTNERS IS RECOGNIZED BASED ON A SELL-THROUGH METHOD USING INFORMATION PROVIDED BY THEM. THESE DISTRIBUTORS AND RETAIL PARTNERS ARE GENERALLY GIVEN BUSINESS TERMS THAT ALLOW THEM TO RETURN A PORTION OF INVENTORY, RECEIVE CREDITS FOR

CHANGES IN SELLING PRICES, AND PARTICIPATE IN VARIOUS COOPERATIVE MARKETING PROGRAMS. IF SALES THROUGH INDIRECT CHANNELS INCREASE, THIS MAY LEAD TO GREATER DIFFICULTY IN FORECASTING THE MIX OF OUR PRODUCTS AND, TO A DEGREE, THE TIMING OF ORDERS FROM

OUR CUSTOMERS.

13

TABLE OF CONTENTS

HISTORICALLY, WE HAVE SEEN FLUCTUATIONS IN OUR GROSS MARGINS BASED ON CHANGES IN THE BALANCE OF OUR

DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS. ALTHOUGH VARIABILITY TO DATE HAS NOT BEEN SIGNIFICANT, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT CHANGES IN THE BALANCE OF OUR DISTRIBUTION MODEL IN FUTURE PERIODS WOULD NOT HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR GROSS MARGINS AND PROFITABILITY.

SOME FACTORS COULD RESULT IN DISRUPTION OF OR CHANGES IN OUR DISTRIBUTION MODEL, WHICH COULD HARM OUR SALES AND MARGINS, INCLUDING THE

FOLLOWING.



WE COMPETE WITH SOME OF OUR CHANNEL PARTNERS THROUGH OUR DIRECT SALES, WHICH MAY LEAD THESE CHANNEL PARTNERS TO USE OTHER SUPPLIERS THAT DO NOT DIRECTLY SELL THEIR

OWN PRODUCTS



SOME OF OUR CHANNEL PARTNERS MAY DEMAND THAT WE ABSORB A GREATER SHARE OF THE RISKS THAT THEIR CUSTOMERS MAY ASK THEM TO BEAR

SOME OF OUR CHANNEL PARTNERS MAY HAVE INSUFFICIENT FINANCIAL RESOURCES AND MAY NOT BE ABLE TO WITHSTAND CHANGES IN BUSINESS CONDITIONS

OUR INVENTORY MANAGEMENT RELATING TO OUR SALES TO OUR TWO-TIER DISTRIBUTION CHANNEL IS COMPLEX, AND EXCESS INVENTORY MAY HARM OUR GROSS MARGINS

WE MUST MANAGE OUR INVENTORY RELATING TO SALES TO OUR DISTRIBUTORS AND RETAIL PARTNERS EFFECTIVELY, BECAUSE INVENTORY HELD BY THEM COULD AFFECT OUR

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. OUR DISTRIBUTORS AND RETAIL PARTNERS MAY INCREASE ORDERS DURING PERIODS OF PRODUCT SHORTAGES, CANCEL ORDERS IF THEIR INVENTORY IS TOO HIGH, OR DELAY ORDERS IN ANTICIPATION OF NEW PRODUCTS. THEY ALSO MAY ADJUST THEIR ORDERS IN

RESPONSE TO THE SUPPLY OF OUR PRODUCTS AND THE PRODUCTS OF OUR COMPETITORS THAT ARE AVAILABLE TO THEM AND IN RESPONSE TO SEASONAL FLUCTUATIONS IN END-USER DEMAND. REVENUE TO OUR DISTRIBUTORS AND RETAIL PARTNERS IS RECOGNIZED BASED ON A SELL-THROUGH

METHOD USING INFORMATION PROVIDED BY THEM, AND THEY ARE GENERALLY GIVEN BUSINESS TERMS THAT ALLOW THEM TO RETURN A PORTION OF INVENTORY, RECEIVE CREDITS FOR CHANGES IN SELLING PRICE, AND PARTICIPATE IN VARIOUS COOPERATIVE MARKETING PROGRAMS.

INVENTORY MANAGEMENT REMAINS AN AREA OF FOCUS AS WE BALANCE THE NEED TO MAINTAIN STRATEGIC INVENTORY LEVELS TO ENSURE COMPETITIVE LEAD TIMES AGAINST THE RISK OF INVENTORY OBSOLESCENCE BECAUSE OF RAPIDLY CHANGING TECHNOLOGY AND CUSTOMER REQUIREMENTS.

IF WE ULTIMATELY DETERMINE THAT WE HAVE EXCESS INVENTORY, WE MAY HAVE TO REDUCE OUR PRICES AND WRITE DOWN INVENTORY, WHICH IN TURN COULD RESULT IN LOWER GROSS MARGINS.

SALES TO THE SERVICE PROVIDER MARKET ARE ESPECIALLY VOLATILE, AND WEAKNESS IN SALES ORDERS FROM THIS INDUSTRY MAY HARM OUR OPERATING RESULTS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

SALES TO THE SERVICE PROVIDER MARKET HAVE BEEN CHARACTERIZED BY LARGER AND MORE UNEVEN PURCHASES, ESPECIALLY RELATING TO OUR ROUTER SALES AND SALES OF

CERTAIN OF OUR ADVANCED TECHNOLOGIES, IN ADDITION TO LONGER SALES CYCLES. WE HAVE EXPERIENCED SIGNIFICANT WEAKNESS IN SALES TO SERVICE PROVIDERS OVER CERTAIN EXTENDED PERIODS OF TIME AS MARKET CONDITIONS HAVE FLUCTUATED. SALES ACTIVITY IN THIS

INDUSTRY DEPENDS UPON THE STAGE OF COMPLETION OF EXPANDING NETWORK INFRASTRUCTURES; THE AVAILABILITY OF FUNDING; AND THE EXTENT TO WHICH SERVICE PROVIDERS ARE AFFECTED BY REGULATORY, ECONOMIC, AND BUSINESS CONDITIONS IN THE COUNTRY OF OPERATIONS.

ALTHOUGH SOME SERVICE PROVIDERS MAY HAVE INCREASED CAPITAL EXPENDITURES OVER THE DEPRESSED LEVELS THAT HAVE PREVAILED OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS, WEAKNESS IN ORDERS FROM THIS INDUSTRY COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, OPERATING

RESULTS, AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. SLOWDOWNS IN THE GENERAL ECONOMY, OVERCAPACITY, CHANGES IN THE SERVICE PROVIDER MARKET, REGULATORY DEVELOPMENTS, AND CONSTRAINTS ON CAPITAL AVAILABILITY HAVE HAD A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON MANY OF OUR SERVICE

PROVIDER CUSTOMERS, WITH MANY OF THESE CUSTOMERS GOING OUT OF BUSINESS OR SUBSTANTIALLY REDUCING THEIR EXPANSION PLANS. THESE CONDITIONS HAVE MATERIALLY HARMED OUR BUSINESS AND OPERATING RESULTS, AND WE EXPECT THAT SOME OR ALL OF THESE CONDITIONS

MAY CONTINUE FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. FINALLY, SERVICE PROVIDER CUSTOMERS TYPICALLY HAVE LONGER IMPLEMENTATION CYCLES; REQUIRE A BROADER RANGE OF SERVICES INCLUDING DESIGN SERVICES; DEMAND THAT VENDORS TAKE ON A LARGER SHARE OF RISKS; OFTEN

REQUIRE ACCEPTANCE PROVISIONS, WHICH CAN LEAD TO A DELAY IN REVENUE RECOGNITION; AND EXPECT FINANCING FROM VENDORS. ALL THESE FACTORS CAN ADD FURTHER RISK TO BUSINESS CONDUCTED WITH SERVICE PROVIDERS.

A SHORTAGE OF ADEQUATE COMPONENT SUPPLY OR MANUFACTURING CAPACITY COULD INCREASE OUR COSTS OR CAUSE A DELAY IN OUR ABILITY TO FULFILL ORDERS, AND OUR FAILURE TO

ESTIMATE CUSTOMER DEMAND PROPERLY MAY RESULT IN EXCESS OR OBSOLETE COMPONENT SUPPLY, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR GROSS MARGINS

OUR

GROWTH AND ABILITY TO MEET CUSTOMER DEMANDS DEPEND IN PART ON OUR ABILITY TO OBTAIN TIMELY DELIVERIES OF PARTS FROM OUR SUPPLIERS AND CONTRACT MANUFACTURERS. WE HAVE EXPERIENCED COMPONENT SHORTAGES IN THE PAST, INCLUDING SHORTAGES CAUSED BY

MANUFACTURING PROCESS ISSUES, THAT HAVE AFFECTED OUR OPERATIONS. WE MAY IN THE FUTURE EXPERIENCE A SHORTAGE OF CERTAIN COMPONENT PARTS AS A RESULT OF OUR OWN MANUFACTURING ISSUES, MANUFACTURING ISSUES AT OUR SUPPLIERS OR CONTRACT MANUFACTURERS,

CAPACITY PROBLEMS EXPERIENCED BY OUR SUPPLIERS OR CONTRACT MANUFACTURERS, OR STRONG DEMAND IN THE INDUSTRY FOR THOSE PARTS, ESPECIALLY IF THE ECONOMY GROWS. GROWTH IN THE ECONOMY IS LIKELY TO CREATE GREATER PRESSURES ON US AND OUR SUPPLIERS TO

ACCURATELY PROJECT OVERALL COMPONENT DEMAND AND COMPONENT DEMANDS WITHIN SPECIFIC PRODUCT CATEGORIES AND TO ESTABLISH OPTIMAL COMPONENT LEVELS.

14

TABLE OF CONTENTS

IF SHORTAGES OR DELAYS PERSIST, THE PRICE OF THESE COMPONENTS MAY INCREASE, OR THE COMPONENTS MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE AT ALL, AND WE MAY ALSO ENCOUNTER

SHORTAGES IF WE DO NOT ACCURATELY ANTICIPATE OUR NEEDS. WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO SECURE ENOUGH COMPONENTS AT REASONABLE PRICES OR OF ACCEPTABLE QUALITY TO BUILD NEW PRODUCTS IN A TIMELY MANNER IN THE QUANTITIES OR CONFIGURATIONS NEEDED. ACCORDINGLY,

OUR REVENUE AND GROSS MARGINS COULD SUFFER UNTIL OTHER SOURCES CAN BE DEVELOPED. OUR OPERATING RESULTS WOULD ALSO BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED IF, ANTICIPATING GREATER DEMAND THAN ACTUALLY DEVELOPS, WE COMMIT TO THE PURCHASE OF MORE COMPONENTS THAN WE

NEED. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL NOT ENCOUNTER THESE PROBLEMS IN THE FUTURE. ALTHOUGH IN MANY CASES WE USE STANDARD PARTS AND COMPONENTS FOR OUR PRODUCTS, CERTAIN COMPONENTS ARE PRESENTLY AVAILABLE ONLY FROM A SINGLE SOURCE OR LIMITED

SOURCES. WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO DIVERSIFY SOURCES IN A TIMELY MANNER, WHICH COULD HARM OUR ABILITY TO DELIVER PRODUCTS TO CUSTOMERS AND SERIOUSLY IMPACT PRESENT AND FUTURE SALES.

WE BELIEVE THAT WE MAY BE FACED WITH THE FOLLOWING CHALLENGES IN THE FUTURE.



NEW MARKETS IN WHICH WE PARTICIPATE MAY GROW QUICKLY, WHICH MAY MAKE IT DIFFICULT TO QUICKLY OBTAIN SIGNIFICANT COMPONENT CAPACITY



AS WE ACQUIRE COMPANIES AND NEW TECHNOLOGIES, WE MAY BE DEPENDENT, AT LEAST INITIALLY, ON UNFAMILIAR SUPPLY CHAINS OR RELATIVELY SMALL SUPPLY PARTNERS



WE FACE COMPETITION FOR CERTAIN COMPONENTS, WHICH ARE SUPPLY-CONSTRAINED, FROM EXISTING COMPETITORS AND COMPANIES IN OTHER MARKETS

MANUFACTURING CAPACITY AND COMPONENT SUPPLY CONSTRAINTS, INCLUDING THOSE CAUSED BY ANY POSSIBLE DISRUPTION RELATED TO OUR RECENTLY COMPLETED

IMPLEMENTATION OF THE LEAN MANUFACTURING MODEL, COULD BE SIGNIFICANT ISSUES FOR US. WE PURCHASE COMPONENTS FROM A VARIETY OF SUPPLIERS AND USE SEVERAL CONTRACT MANUFACTURERS TO PROVIDE MANUFACTURING SERVICES FOR OUR PRODUCTS. DURING THE NORMAL

COURSE OF BUSINESS, IN ORDER TO IMPROVE MANUFACTURING LEAD-TIME PERFORMANCE AND TO HELP ENSURE ADEQUATE COMPONENT SUPPLY, WE ENTER INTO AGREEMENTS WITH CONTRACT MANUFACTURERS AND SUPPLIERS THAT EITHER ALLOW THEM TO PROCURE INVENTORY BASED UPON

CRITERIA AS DEFINED BY US OR THAT ESTABLISH THE PARAMETERS DEFINING OUR REQUIREMENTS. IN CERTAIN INSTANCES, THESE AGREEMENTS ALLOW US THE OPTION TO CANCEL, RESCHEDULE, AND ADJUST OUR REQUIREMENTS BASED ON OUR BUSINESS NEEDS PRIOR TO FIRM ORDERS

BEING PLACED. IF WE FAIL TO ANTICIPATE CUSTOMER DEMAND PROPERLY, AN OVERSUPPLY OF PARTS COULD RESULT IN EXCESS OR OBSOLETE COMPONENTS THAT COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR GROSS MARGINS. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING OUR PURCHASE COMMITMENTS WITH

CONTRACT MANUFACTURERS AND SUPPLIERS, SEE NOTE 8 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN OUR 2007 ANNUAL REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS WHICH NOTE IS INCORPORATED INTO THIS REPORT BY REFERENCE.

A REDUCTION OR INTERRUPTION IN SUPPLY; A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN THE PRICE OF ONE OR MORE COMPONENTS; A FAILURE TO ADEQUATELY AUTHORIZE PROCUREMENT OF

INVENTORY BY OUR CONTRACT MANUFACTURERS; A FAILURE TO APPROPRIATELY CANCEL, RESCHEDULE, OR ADJUST OUR REQUIREMENTS BASED ON OUR BUSINESS NEEDS; OR A DECREASE IN DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS COULD MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, OPERATING

RESULTS, AND FINANCIAL CONDITION AND COULD MATERIALLY DAMAGE CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIPS. FURTHERMORE, AS A RESULT OF BINDING PRICE OR PURCHASE COMMITMENTS WITH SUPPLIERS, WE MAY BE OBLIGATED TO PURCHASE COMPONENTS AT PRICES THAT ARE HIGHER THAN THOSE

AVAILABLE IN THE CURRENT MARKET. IN THE EVENT THAT WE BECOME COMMITTED TO PURCHASE COMPONENTS AT PRICES IN EXCESS OF THE CURRENT MARKET PRICE WHEN THE COMPONENTS ARE ACTUALLY USED, OUR GROSS MARGINS COULD DECREASE.

THE FACT THAT WE DO NOT OWN THE BULK OF OUR MANUFACTURING FACILITIES COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON THE SUPPLY OF OUR PRODUCTS AND ON OUR OPERATING

RESULTS. FINANCIAL PROBLEMS OF CONTRACT MANUFACTURERS ON WHOM WE RELY, OR RESERVATION OF MANUFACTURING CAPACITY BY OTHER COMPANIES, INSIDE OR OUTSIDE OF OUR INDUSTRY, COULD EITHER LIMIT SUPPLY OR INCREASE COSTS.

OUR KEY MANUFACTURING FACILITIES FOR SCIENTIFIC-ATLANTAS PRODUCTS ARE LOCATED IN JUAREZ, MEXICO, AND WE MAY BE MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY

ANY PROLONGED DISRUPTION IN THE OPERATION OF THIS FACILITY.

THE MARKETS IN WHICH WE COMPETE ARE INTENSELY COMPETITIVE, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR

REVENUE GROWTH

THE MARKETS IN WHICH WE COMPETE ARE CHARACTERIZED BY RAPID CHANGE, CONVERGING TECHNOLOGIES, AND A MIGRATION TO

NETWORKING SOLUTIONS THAT OFFER RELATIVE ADVANTAGES. THESE MARKET FACTORS REPRESENT A COMPETITIVE THREAT TO US. WE COMPETE WITH NUMEROUS VENDORS IN EACH PRODUCT CATEGORY. THE OVERALL NUMBER OF OUR COMPETITORS PROVIDING NICHE PRODUCT SOLUTIONS MAY

INCREASE. ALSO, THE IDENTITY AND COMPOSITION OF COMPETITORS MAY CHANGE AS WE INCREASE OUR ACTIVITY IN OUR ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY MARKETS. AS WE CONTINUE TO EXPAND GLOBALLY, WE MAY SEE NEW COMPETITION IN DIFFERENT GEOGRAPHIC REGIONS. IN PARTICULAR, WE

HAVE EXPERIENCED PRICE-FOCUSED COMPETITION FROM COMPETITORS IN ASIA, ESPECIALLY CHINA, AND WE ANTICIPATE THIS WILL CONTINUE. FOR INFORMATION REGARDING OUR COMPETITION AND THE RISKS ARISING OUT OF THE COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH WE OPERATE, SEE

THE SECTION ENTITLED COMPETITION CONTAINED IN ITEM 1 OF THIS REPORT.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

WE DEPEND UPON THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW PRODUCTS AND ENHANCEMENTS TO EXISTING PRODUCTS, AND IF WE FAIL TO PREDICT AND

RESPOND TO EMERGING TECHNOLOGICAL TRENDS AND CUSTOMERS CHANGING NEEDS, OUR OPERATING RESULTS AND MARKET SHARE MAY SUFFER

THE

MARKETS FOR OUR PRODUCTS ARE CHARACTERIZED BY RAPIDLY CHANGING TECHNOLOGY, EVOLVING INDUSTRY STANDARDS, NEW PRODUCT INTRODUCTIONS, AND EVOLVING METHODS OF BUILDING AND OPERATING NETWORKS. OUR OPERATING RESULTS DEPEND ON OUR ABILITY TO DEVELOP AND

INTRODUCE NEW PRODUCTS INTO EXISTING AND EMERGING MARKETS AND TO REDUCE THE PRODUCTION COSTS OF EXISTING PRODUCTS. WE BELIEVE THE INDUSTRY IS EVOLVING TO ENABLE PERSONAL AND BUSINESS PROCESS COLLABORATION ENABLED BY WEB 2.0, THE TECHNOLOGIES THAT

ENABLE USER COLLABORATION, AS PART OF THE SECOND MAJOR PHASE OF THE INTERNET. AS SUCH, MANY OF OUR STRATEGIC INITIATIVES AND INVESTMENTS ARE AIMED AT MEETING THE REQUIREMENTS THAT A NETWORK CAPABLE OF MULTIPLE PARTY, COLLABORATIVE INTERACTION WOULD

DEMAND, AND THE INVESTMENTS WE HAVE MADE AND OUR ARCHITECTURAL APPROACH ARE DESIGNED TO ENABLE WEB 2.0 AND THE INCREASED USE OF THE NETWORK AS THE PLATFORM FOR ALL FORMS OF COMMUNICATIONS AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY. THE PROCESS OF DEVELOPING NEW

TECHNOLOGY IS COMPLEX AND UNCERTAIN, AND IF WE FAIL TO ACCURATELY PREDICT CUSTOMERS CHANGING NEEDS AND EMERGING TECHNOLOGICAL TRENDS OUR BUSINESS COULD BE HARMED. WE MUST COMMIT SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES TO DEVELOPING NEW PRODUCTS BEFORE KNOWING

WHETHER OUR INVESTMENTS WILL RESULT IN PRODUCTS THE MARKET WILL ACCEPT. IN PARTICULAR, IF OUR MODEL OF THE EVOLUTION OF NETWORKING TO COLLABORATIVE SYSTEMS DOES NOT EMERGE AS WE BELIEVE IT WILL, OR IF THE INDUSTRY DOES NOT EVOLVE AS WE BELIEVE IT

WILL, MANY OF OUR STRATEGIC INITIATIVES AND INVESTMENTS MAY BE OF NO OR LIMITED VALUE. FURTHERMORE, WE MAY NOT EXECUTE SUCCESSFULLY ON THAT VISION BECAUSE OF ERRORS IN PRODUCT PLANNING OR TIMING, TECHNICAL HURDLES THAT WE FAIL TO OVERCOME IN A

TIMELY FASHION, OR A LACK OF APPROPRIATE RESOURCES. THIS COULD RESULT IN COMPETITORS PROVIDING THOSE SOLUTIONS BEFORE WE DO AND LOSS OF MARKET SHARE, NET SALES, AND EARNINGS. THE SUCCESS OF NEW PRODUCTS DEPENDS ON SEVERAL FACTORS, INCLUDING PROPER

NEW PRODUCT DEFINITION, COMPONENT COSTS, TIMELY COMPLETION AND INTRODUCTION OF THESE PRODUCTS, DIFFERENTIATION OF NEW PRODUCTS FROM THOSE OF OUR COMPETITORS, AND MARKET ACCEPTANCE OF THESE PRODUCTS. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL

SUCCESSFULLY IDENTIFY NEW PRODUCT OPPORTUNITIES, DEVELOP AND BRING NEW PRODUCTS TO MARKET IN A TIMELY MANNER, OR ACHIEVE MARKET ACCEPTANCE OF OUR PRODUCTS OR THAT PRODUCTS AND TECHNOLOGIES DEVELOPED BY OTHERS WILL NOT RENDER OUR PRODUCTS OR

TECHNOLOGIES OBSOLETE OR NONCOMPETITIVE. SPECIFICALLY, THE PRODUCTS AND TECHNOLOGIES THAT WE IDENTIFY AS EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES, SUCH AS OUR TELEPRESENCE PRODUCTS, OR ADVANCED TECHNOLOGIES MAY NOT PROVE TO HAVE THE MARKET

SUCCESS WE ANTICIPATE, AND WE MAY NOT SUCCESSFULLY IDENTIFY AND INVEST IN OTHER EMERGING OR ADVANCED TECHNOLOGIES.

WE ARE INCREASING OUR INVESTMENT IN

ENGINEERING, SALES, AND MANUFACTURING ACTIVITIES AND THESE INVESTMENTS MAY ACHIEVE DELAYED, OR LOWER THAN EXPECTED, BENEFITS WHICH COULD HARM OUR OPERATING RESULTS

WE INTEND TO CONTINUE TO ADD PERSONNEL AND OTHER RESOURCES TO OUR ENGINEERING, SALES AND MANUFACTURING FUNCTIONS AS WE FOCUS ON DEVELOPING EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES, THE NEXT WAVE OF ADVANCED TECHNOLOGIES, GROWING THE

COMMERCIAL MARKET SEGMENT, CAPITALIZING ON OUR EMERGING MARKET OPPORTUNITIES, ENHANCING OUR EVOLVING SUPPORT MODEL AND INCREASING OUR MARKET SHARE GAINS. WE ARE LIKELY TO RECOGNIZE THE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THESE INVESTMENTS EARLIER THAN SOME OF THE

ANTICIPATED BENEFITS, AND THE RETURN ON THESE INVESTMENTS MAY BE LOWER, OR MAY DEVELOP MORE SLOWLY, THAN WE EXPECT. IF WE DO NOT ACHIEVE THE BENEFITS ANTICIPATED FROM THESE INVESTMENTS, OR IF THE ACHIEVEMENT OF THESE BENEFITS IS DELAYED, OUR

OPERATING RESULTS MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

OUR BUSINESS SUBSTANTIALLY DEPENDS UPON THE CONTINUED GROWTH OF THE INTERNET AND INTERNET-BASED SYSTEMS

A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF OUR BUSINESS AND REVENUE DEPENDS ON GROWTH AND EVOLUTION OF THE INTERNET AND ON THE DEPLOYMENT OF OUR PRODUCTS

BY CUSTOMERS WHO DEPEND ON THE CONTINUED GROWTH AND EVOLUTION OF THE INTERNET. TO THE EXTENT THAT AN ECONOMIC SLOWDOWN AND REDUCTION IN CAPITAL SPENDING ADVERSELY AFFECT SPENDING ON INTERNET INFRASTRUCTURE, WE COULD EXPERIENCE MATERIAL HARM TO OUR

BUSINESS, OPERATING RESULTS, AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

BECAUSE OF THE RAPID INTRODUCTION OF NEW PRODUCTS AND CHANGING CUSTOMER REQUIREMENTS

RELATED TO MATTERS SUCH AS COST-EFFECTIVENESS AND SECURITY, WE BELIEVE THAT THERE COULD BE CERTAIN PERFORMANCE PROBLEMS WITH INTERNET COMMUNICATIONS IN THE FUTURE, WHICH COULD RECEIVE A HIGH DEGREE OF PUBLICITY AND VISIBILITY. BECAUSE WE ARE A LARGE

SUPPLIER OF NETWORKING PRODUCTS, OUR BUSINESS, OPERATING RESULTS, AND FINANCIAL CONDITION MAY BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER OR NOT THESE PROBLEMS ARE DUE TO THE PERFORMANCE OF OUR OWN PRODUCTS. SUCH AN EVENT COULD ALSO

RESULT IN A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE MARKET PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK INDEPENDENT OF DIRECT EFFECTS ON OUR BUSINESS.

CHANGES IN INDUSTRY

STRUCTURE AND MARKET CONDITIONS COULD LEAD TO CHARGES RELATED TO DISCONTINUANCES OF CERTAIN OF OUR PRODUCTS OR BUSINESSES AND ASSET IMPAIRMENTS

IN RESPONSE TO CHANGES IN INDUSTRY AND MARKET CONDITIONS, WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO STRATEGICALLY REALIGN OUR RESOURCES AND CONSIDER RESTRUCTURING, DISPOSING OF, OR OTHERWISE EXITING BUSINESSES. ANY DECISION TO LIMIT INVESTMENT IN OR DISPOSE OF

OR OTHERWISE EXIT BUSINESSES MAY RESULT IN THE RECORDING OF SPECIAL CHARGES, SUCH AS INVENTORY AND TECHNOLOGY-RELATED WRITE-OFFS, WORKFORCE REDUCTION COSTS, CHARGES RELATING TO CONSOLIDATION OF EXCESS FACILITIES, OR CLAIMS FROM THIRD PARTIES WHO

WERE RESELLERS OR USERS OF DISCONTINUED PRODUCTS. OUR ESTIMATES WITH RESPECT TO THE USEFUL LIFE OR ULTIMATE RECOVERABILITY OF OUR CARRYING BASIS OF ASSETS, INCLUDING PURCHASED

16

TABLE OF CONTENTS

INTANGIBLE ASSETS, COULD CHANGE AS A RESULT OF SUCH ASSESSMENTS AND DECISIONS. FURTHER, OUR ESTIMATES RELATING TO THE LIABILITIES FOR EXCESS FACILITIES ARE

AFFECTED BY CHANGES IN REAL ESTATE MARKET CONDITIONS. ADDITIONALLY, WE ARE REQUIRED TO PERFORM GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT TESTS ON AN ANNUAL BASIS AND BETWEEN ANNUAL TESTS IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES, AND FUTURE GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT TESTS MAY RESULT IN A

CHARGE TO EARNINGS.

WE HAVE MADE AND EXPECT TO CONTINUE TO MAKE ACQUISITIONS THAT COULD DISRUPT OUR OPERATIONS AND HARM OUR OPERATING RESULTS

OUR GROWTH DEPENDS UPON MARKET GROWTH, OUR ABILITY TO ENHANCE OUR EXISTING PRODUCTS, AND OUR ABILITY TO INTRODUCE NEW PRODUCTS ON A

TIMELY BASIS. WE INTEND TO CONTINUE TO ADDRESS THE NEED TO DEVELOP NEW PRODUCTS AND ENHANCE EXISTING PRODUCTS THROUGH ACQUISITIONS OF OTHER COMPANIES, PRODUCT LINES, TECHNOLOGIES, AND PERSONNEL. ACQUISITIONS INVOLVE NUMEROUS RISKS, INCLUDING THE

FOLLOWING.



DIFFICULTIES IN INTEGRATING THE OPERATIONS, SYSTEMS, TECHNOLOGIES, PRODUCTS, AND PERSONNEL OF THE ACQUIRED COMPANIES, PARTICULARLY COMPANIES WITH LARGE AND

WIDESPREAD OPERATIONS AND/OR COMPLEX PRODUCTS, SUCH AS SCIENTIFIC-ATLANTA AND WEBEX



DIVERSION OF MANAGEMENTS ATTENTION FROM NORMAL DAILY OPERATIONS OF THE BUSINESS AND THE CHALLENGES OF MANAGING LARGER AND MORE WIDESPREAD OPERATIONS RESULTING

FROM ACQUISITIONS



POTENTIAL DIFFICULTIES IN COMPLETING PROJECTS ASSOCIATED WITH IN-PROCESS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT



DIFFICULTIES IN ENTERING MARKETS IN WHICH WE HAVE NO OR LIMITED DIRECT PRIOR EXPERIENCE AND WHERE COMPETITORS IN SUCH MARKETS HAVE STRONGER MARKET POSITIONS



INITIAL DEPENDENCE ON UNFAMILIAR SUPPLY CHAINS OR RELATIVELY SMALL SUPPLY PARTNERS



INSUFFICIENT REVENUE TO OFFSET INCREASED EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH ACQUISITIONS



THE POTENTIAL LOSS OF KEY EMPLOYEES, CUSTOMERS, DISTRIBUTORS, VENDORS AND OTHER BUSINESS PARTNERS OF THE COMPANIES WE ACQUIRE FOLLOWING AND CONTINUING AFTER

ANNOUNCEMENT OF ACQUISITION PLANS

ACQUISITIONS MAY ALSO CAUSE US TO.



ISSUE COMMON STOCK THAT WOULD DILUTE OUR CURRENT SHAREHOLDERS PERCENTAGE OWNERSHIP



USE A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF OUR CASH RESOURCES, AS WE DID IN CONNECTION WITH OUR ACQUISITIONS OF WEBEX AND IRONPORT, OR INCUR DEBT AS WE DID IN FEBRUARY 2006 WHEN

WE ISSUED AND SOLD $6.5 BILLION IN SENIOR UNSECURED NOTES TO FUND OUR ACQUISITION OF SCIENTIFIC-ATLANTA



SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE OUR INTEREST EXPENSE, LEVERAGE AND DEBT SERVICE REQUIREMENTS IF WE INCUR ADDITIONAL DEBT TO PAY FOR AN ACQUISITION



ASSUME LIABILITIES



RECORD GOODWILL AND NONAMORTIZABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS THAT ARE SUBJECT TO IMPAIRMENT TESTING ON A REGULAR BASIS AND POTENTIAL PERIODIC IMPAIRMENT CHARGES



INCUR AMORTIZATION EXPENSES RELATED TO CERTAIN INTANGIBLE ASSETS



INCUR TAX EXPENSES RELATED TO THE POST-ACQUISITION INTEGRATION OF PURCHASED INTANGIBLE ASSETS INTO OUR INTERCOMPANY R&D COST SHARING ARRANGEMENT



INCUR LARGE AND IMMEDIATE WRITE-OFFS AND RESTRUCTURING AND OTHER RELATED EXPENSES



BECOME SUBJECT TO INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY OR OTHER LITIGATION

TABLE OF CONTENTS

MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS OF HIGH-TECHNOLOGY COMPANIES ARE INHERENTLY RISKY AND SUBJECT TO MANY FACTORS

OUTSIDE OF OUR CONTROL, AND NO ASSURANCE CAN BE GIVEN THAT OUR PREVIOUS OR FUTURE ACQUISITIONS WILL BE SUCCESSFUL AND WILL NOT MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, OPERATING RESULTS, OR FINANCIAL CONDITION. FAILURE TO MANAGE AND SUCCESSFULLY

INTEGRATE ACQUISITIONS COULD MATERIALLY HARM OUR BUSINESS AND OPERATING RESULTS. PRIOR ACQUISITIONS HAVE RESULTED IN A WIDE RANGE OF OUTCOMES, FROM SUCCESSFUL INTRODUCTION OF NEW PRODUCTS AND TECHNOLOGIES TO A FAILURE TO DO SO. EVEN WHEN AN ACQUIRED

COMPANY HAS ALREADY DEVELOPED AND MARKETED PRODUCTS, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT PRODUCT ENHANCEMENTS WILL BE MADE IN A TIMELY FASHION OR THAT PREACQUISITION DUE DILIGENCE WILL HAVE IDENTIFIED ALL POSSIBLE ISSUES THAT MIGHT ARISE WITH RESPECT TO

SUCH PRODUCTS.

FROM TIME TO TIME, WE HAVE MADE ACQUISITIONS THAT RESULTED IN IN-PROCESS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES BEING CHARGED IN

AN INDIVIDUAL QUARTER. THESE CHARGES MAY OCCUR IN ANY PARTICULAR QUARTER, RESULTING IN VARIABILITY IN OUR QUARTERLY EARNINGS. IN ADDITION, OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR FUTURE PERIODS IS UNCERTAIN, AND COULD BE IMPACTED BY MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS.

RISKS RELATED TO NEW PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT ALSO APPLY TO ACQUISITIONS. PLEASE SEE THE RISK FACTORS ABOVE, INCLUDING THE RISK FACTOR ENTITLED WE DEPEND UPON THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW PRODUCTS AND ENHANCEMENTS TO EXISTING PRODUCTS, AND IF WE FAIL TO

PREDICT AND RESPOND TO EMERGING TECHNOLOGICAL TRENDS AND CUSTOMERS CHANGING NEEDS, OUR OPERATING RESULTS AND MARKET SHARE MAY SUFFER FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION.

ENTRANCE INTO NEW OR DEVELOPING MARKETS EXPOSES US TO ADDITIONAL COMPETITION AND WILL LIKELY INCREASE DEMANDS ON OUR SERVICE AND SUPPORT OPERATIONS

AS WE FOCUS ON NEW MARKET OPPORTUNITIESFOR EXAMPLE, STORAGE; WIRELESS; SECURITY; AND TRANSPORTING DATA, VOICE, AND VIDEO TRAFFIC ACROSS THE SAME

NETWORK, AND OTHER ADVANCED TECHNOLOGIES AND EMERGING TECHNOLOGIESWE WILL INCREASINGLY COMPETE WITH LARGE TELECOMMUNICATIONS EQUIPMENT SUPPLIERS AS WELL AS STARTUP COMPANIES. SEVERAL OF OUR COMPETITORS MAY HAVE GREATER RESOURCES, INCLUDING

TECHNICAL AND ENGINEERING RESOURCES, THAN WE DO. ADDITIONALLY, AS CUSTOMERS IN THESE MARKETS COMPLETE INFRASTRUCTURE DEPLOYMENTS, THEY MAY REQUIRE GREATER LEVELS OF SERVICE, SUPPORT, AND FINANCING THAN WE HAVE PROVIDED IN THE PAST. DEMAND FOR THESE

TYPES OF SERVICE OR FINANCING CONTRACTS MAY INCREASE IN THE FUTURE. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT WE CAN PROVIDE PRODUCTS, SERVICE, SUPPORT, AND FINANCING TO EFFECTIVELY COMPETE FOR THESE MARKET OPPORTUNITIES. FURTHER, PROVISION OF GREATER LEVELS

OF SERVICES BY US MAY RESULT IN A DELAY IN THE TIMING OF REVENUE RECOGNITION. IN ADDITION, ENTRY INTO OTHER MARKETS, INCLUDING OUR ENTRY INTO THE CONSUMER MARKET, HAS SUBJECTED AND WILL SUBJECT US TO ADDITIONAL RISKS, PARTICULARLY TO THOSE MARKETS,

INCLUDING THE EFFECTS OF GENERAL MARKET CONDITIONS AND REDUCED CONSUMER CONFIDENCE.

PRODUCT QUALITY PROBLEMS COULD LEAD TO REDUCED REVENUE, GROSS

MARGINS, AND NET INCOME

WE PRODUCE HIGHLY COMPLEX PRODUCTS THAT INCORPORATE LEADING-EDGE TECHNOLOGY, INCLUDING BOTH HARDWARE AND

SOFTWARE. SOFTWARE TYPICALLY CONTAINS BUGS THAT CAN UNEXPECTEDLY INTERFERE WITH EXPECTED OPERATIONS. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT OUR PRESHIPMENT TESTING PROGRAMS WILL BE ADEQUATE TO DETECT ALL DEFECTS, EITHER ONES IN INDIVIDUAL PRODUCTS OR ONES

THAT COULD AFFECT NUMEROUS SHIPMENTS, WHICH MIGHT INTERFERE WITH CUSTOMER SATISFACTION, REDUCE SALES OPPORTUNITIES, OR AFFECT GROSS MARGINS. IN THE PAST, WE HAVE HAD TO REPLACE CERTAIN COMPONENTS AND PROVIDE REMEDIATION IN RESPONSE TO THE DISCOVERY

OF DEFECTS OR BUGS IN PRODUCTS THAT WE HAD SHIPPED. ALTHOUGH THE COST OF SUCH REMEDIATION HAS NOT BEEN MATERIAL IN THE PAST, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT SUCH A REMEDIATION, DEPENDING ON THE PRODUCT INVOLVED, WOULD NOT HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT. AN

INABILITY TO CURE A PRODUCT DEFECT COULD RESULT IN THE FAILURE OF A PRODUCT LINE, TEMPORARY OR PERMANENT WITHDRAWAL FROM A PRODUCT OR MARKET, DAMAGE TO OUR REPUTATION, INVENTORY COSTS, OR PRODUCT REENGINEERING EXPENSES, ANY OF WHICH COULD HAVE A

MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR REVENUE, MARGINS, AND NET INCOME.

INDUSTRY CONSOLIDATION MAY LEAD TO INCREASED COMPETITION AND MAY HARM OUR OPERATING RESULTS

THERE HAS BEEN A TREND TOWARD INDUSTRY CONSOLIDATION IN OUR MARKETS FOR SEVERAL YEARS. WE EXPECT THIS TREND TO CONTINUE AS COMPANIES

ATTEMPT TO STRENGTHEN OR HOLD THEIR MARKET POSITIONS IN AN EVOLVING INDUSTRY AND AS COMPANIES ARE ACQUIRED OR ARE UNABLE TO CONTINUE OPERATIONS. WE BELIEVE THAT INDUSTRY CONSOLIDATION MAY RESULT IN STRONGER COMPETITORS THAT ARE BETTER ABLE TO

COMPETE AS SOLE-SOURCE VENDORS FOR CUSTOMERS. THIS COULD LEAD TO MORE VARIABILITY IN OUR OPERATING RESULTS AND COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, OPERATING RESULTS, AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. FURTHERMORE, PARTICULARLY IN THE SERVICE

PROVIDER MARKET, RAPID CONSOLIDATION WILL LEAD TO FEWER CUSTOMERS, WITH THE EFFECT THAT LOSS OF A MAJOR CUSTOMER COULD HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON RESULTS NOT ANTICIPATED IN A CUSTOMER MARKETPLACE COMPOSED OF MORE NUMEROUS PARTICIPANTS.

DUE TO THE GLOBAL NATURE OF OUR OPERATIONS, POLITICAL OR ECONOMIC CHANGES OR OTHER FACTORS IN A SPECIFIC COUNTRY OR REGION COULD HARM OUR OPERATING RESULTS AND

FINANCIAL CONDITION

WE CONDUCT SIGNIFICANT SALES AND CUSTOMER SUPPORT OPERATIONS IN COUNTRIES OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES, MAINTAIN A

MANUFACTURING FACILITY FOR A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF OUR VIDEO SYSTEMS PRODUCTS IN JUAREZ, MEXICO, AND ALSO DEPEND ON NON-U.S. OPERATIONS OF OUR CONTRACT MANUFACTURERS AND OUR DISTRIBUTION PARTNERS. RECENTLY OUR EMERGING MARKETS THEATER HAS BEEN

THE FASTEST GROWING OF OUR BUSINESS SEGMENTS, AND OUR GROWTH DEPENDS IN PART ON OUR CONTINUING TO INCREASE SALES INTO THIS THEATER. OUR FUTURE RESULTS COULD BE

18

TABLE OF CONTENTS

MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY A VARIETY OF UNCONTROLLABLE AND CHANGING FACTORS RELATING TO OUR OPERATIONS OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES, ANY OR ALL OF WHICH

COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR OPERATING RESULTS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION, INCLUDING, AMONG OTHERS, FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES; POLITICAL OR SOCIAL UNREST, ECONOMIC INSTABILITY OR NATURAL DISASTERS IN A SPECIFIC COUNTRY OR REGION;

ENVIRONMENTAL AND TRADE PROTECTION MEASURES AND OTHER REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS, WHICH MAY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO IMPORT OUR PRODUCTS TO, EXPORT OUR PRODUCTS FROM, OR SELL OUR PRODUCTS IN VARIOUS COUNTRIES; POLITICAL CONSIDERATIONS THAT AFFECT SERVICE

PROVIDER AND GOVERNMENT SPENDING PATTERNS; HEALTH OR SIMILAR ISSUES, SUCH AS A PANDEMIC OR EPIDEMIC; DIFFICULTIES IN STAFFING AND MANAGING INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS; AND ADVERSE TAX CONSEQUENCES, INCLUDING IMPOSITION OF WITHHOLDING OR OTHER TAXES ON

PAYMENTS BY SUBSIDIARIES.

WE ARE EXPOSED TO FLUCTUATIONS IN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES THAT COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS AND CASH FLOWS

BECAUSE A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR BUSINESS IS CONDUCTED OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES, WE FACE EXPOSURE TO ADVERSE MOVEMENTS IN FOREIGN

CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES. THESE EXPOSURES MAY CHANGE OVER TIME AS BUSINESS PRACTICES EVOLVE, AND THEY COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS AND CASH FLOWS. HISTORICALLY, OUR PRIMARY EXPOSURES HAVE RELATED TO

NONDOLLAR-DENOMINATED SALES IN JAPAN, CANADA, AND AUSTRALIA AND CERTAIN NON-DOLLAR-DENOMINATED OPERATING EXPENSES IN EUROPE, LATIN AMERICA, AND ASIA, WHERE WE SELL PRIMARILY IN U.S. DOLLARS. ADDITIONALLY, WE HAVE EXPOSURES TO EMERGING MARKET

CURRENCIES, WHICH CAN HAVE EXTREME CURRENCY VOLATILITY. AN INCREASE IN THE VALUE OF THE DOLLAR COULD INCREASE THE REAL COST TO OUR CUSTOMERS OF OUR PRODUCTS IN THOSE MARKETS OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES WHERE WE SELL IN DOLLARS, AND A WEAKENED DOLLAR

COULD INCREASE THE COST OF LOCAL OPERATING EXPENSES AND PROCUREMENT OF RAW MATERIALS TO THE EXTENT THAT WE MUST PURCHASE COMPONENTS IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES.

CURRENTLY, WE ENTER INTO FOREIGN EXCHANGE FORWARD CONTRACTS TO REDUCE THE SHORT-TERM IMPACT OF FOREIGN CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS ON CERTAIN FOREIGN CURRENCY RECEIVABLES, INVESTMENTS, AND PAYABLES. IN ADDITION, WE

PERIODICALLY HEDGE ANTICIPATED FOREIGN CURRENCY CASH FLOWS. OUR ATTEMPTS TO HEDGE AGAINST THESE RISKS MAY NOT BE SUCCESSFUL, RESULTING IN AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR NET INCOME.

WE ARE EXPOSED TO THE CREDIT RISK OF SOME OF OUR CUSTOMERS AND TO CREDIT EXPOSURES IN WEAKENED MARKETS, WHICH COULD RESULT IN MATERIAL LOSSES

MOST OF OUR SALES ARE ON AN OPEN CREDIT BASIS, WITH TYPICAL PAYMENT TERMS OF 30 DAYS IN THE UNITED STATES AND, BECAUSE OF LOCAL CUSTOMS OR CONDITIONS,

LONGER IN SOME MARKETS OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES. WE MONITOR INDIVIDUAL CUSTOMER PAYMENT CAPABILITY IN GRANTING SUCH OPEN CREDIT ARRANGEMENTS, SEEK TO LIMIT SUCH OPEN CREDIT TO AMOUNTS WE BELIEVE THE CUSTOMERS CAN PAY, AND MAINTAIN RESERVES WE

BELIEVE ARE ADEQUATE TO COVER EXPOSURE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS. BEYOND OUR OPEN CREDIT ARRANGEMENTS, WE HAVE ALSO EXPERIENCED DEMANDS FOR CUSTOMER FINANCING AND FACILITATION OF LEASING ARRANGEMENTS. WE EXPECT DEMAND FOR CUSTOMER FINANCING TO CONTINUE.

WE BELIEVE CUSTOMER FINANCING IS A COMPETITIVE FACTOR IN OBTAINING BUSINESS, PARTICULARLY IN SUPPLYING CUSTOMERS INVOLVED IN SIGNIFICANT INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS. OUR LOAN FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS MAY INCLUDE NOT ONLY FINANCING THE ACQUISITION OF OUR

PRODUCTS AND SERVICES BUT ALSO PROVIDING ADDITIONAL FUNDS FOR OTHER COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH NETWORK INSTALLATION AND INTEGRATION OF OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES AND FOR WORKING CAPITAL PURPOSES. WE DO NOT RECOGNIZE REVENUE ON CUSTOMER LOAN FINANCING

ARRANGEMENTS UNTIL CASH PAYMENTS ARE RECEIVED.

OUR EXPOSURE TO THE CREDIT RISKS RELATING TO OUR FINANCING ACTIVITIES DESCRIBED ABOVE MAY

INCREASE IF THERE IS AN ECONOMIC SLOWDOWN. ALTHOUGH WE HAVE PROGRAMS IN PLACE THAT ARE DESIGNED TO MONITOR AND MITIGATE THE ASSOCIATED RISK, INCLUDING MONITORING OF PARTICULAR RISKS IN CERTAIN GEOGRAPHIC AREAS, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT SUCH

PROGRAMS WILL BE EFFECTIVE IN REDUCING OUR CREDIT RISKS. THERE HAVE BEEN SIGNIFICANT BANKRUPTCIES AMONG CUSTOMERS BOTH ON OPEN CREDIT AND WITH LOAN OR LEASE FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS, PARTICULARLY AMONG INTERNET BUSINESSES AND SERVICE PROVIDERS,

CAUSING US TO INCUR ECONOMIC OR FINANCIAL LOSSES. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT ADDITIONAL LOSSES WILL NOT BE INCURRED. ALTHOUGH THESE LOSSES HAVE NOT BEEN MATERIAL TO DATE, FUTURE LOSSES, IF INCURRED, COULD HARM OUR BUSINESS AND HAVE A MATERIAL

ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR OPERATING RESULTS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. A PORTION OF OUR SALES IS DERIVED THROUGH OUR DISTRIBUTORS AND RETAIL PARTNERS. THESE DISTRIBUTORS AND RETAIL PARTNERS ARE GENERALLY GIVEN BUSINESS TERMS THAT ALLOW THEM TO RETURN A

PORTION OF INVENTORY, RECEIVE CREDITS FOR CHANGES IN SELLING PRICES, AND PARTICIPATE IN VARIOUS COOPERATIVE MARKETING PROGRAMS. WE MAINTAIN ESTIMATED ACCRUALS AND ALLOWANCES FOR SUCH BUSINESS TERMS. HOWEVER, DISTRIBUTORS TEND TO HAVE MORE LIMITED

FINANCIAL RESOURCES THAN OTHER RESELLERS AND END-USER CUSTOMERS AND THEREFORE REPRESENT POTENTIAL SOURCES OF INCREASED CREDIT RISK BECAUSE THEY MAY BE MORE LIKELY TO LACK THE RESERVE RESOURCES TO MEET PAYMENT OBLIGATIONS.

OUR PROPRIETARY RIGHTS MAY PROVE DIFFICULT TO ENFORCE

WE GENERALLY RELY ON PATENTS, COPYRIGHTS, TRADEMARKS, AND TRADE SECRET LAWS TO ESTABLISH AND MAINTAIN PROPRIETARY RIGHTS IN OUR TECHNOLOGY AND PRODUCTS. ALTHOUGH WE HAVE BEEN ISSUED NUMEROUS PATENTS AND OTHER PATENT APPLICATIONS ARE

CURRENTLY PENDING, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT ANY OF THESE PATENTS OR OTHER PROPRIETARY RIGHTS WILL NOT BE CHALLENGED, INVALIDATED, OR CIRCUMVENTED OR THAT OUR RIGHTS WILL, IN FACT, PROVIDE COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGES TO US. FURTHERMORE, MANY KEY

ASPECTS OF NETWORKING TECHNOLOGY ARE GOVERNED BY INDUSTRYWIDE STANDARDS, WHICH ARE USABLE BY ALL MARKET ENTRANTS. IN ADDITION, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT PATENTS WILL BE ISSUED FROM PENDING APPLICATIONS OR THAT CLAIMS ALLOWED ON ANY PATENTS WILL

BE SUFFICIENTLY BROAD TO PROTECT OUR TECHNOLOGY. IN ADDITION, THE LAWS OF SOME FOREIGN COUNTRIES MAY NOT PROTECT OUR PROPRIETARY RIGHTS TO THE SAME EXTENT AS DO THE LAWS OF THE

19

TABLE OF CONTENTS

UNITED STATES. THE OUTCOME OF ANY ACTIONS TAKEN IN THESE FOREIGN COUNTRIES MAY BE DIFFERENT THAN IF SUCH ACTIONS WERE DETERMINED UNDER THE LAWS OF THE UNITED

STATES. ALTHOUGH WE ARE NOT DEPENDENT ON ANY INDIVIDUAL PATENTS OR GROUP OF PATENTS FOR PARTICULAR SEGMENTS OF THE BUSINESS FOR WHICH WE COMPETE, IF WE ARE UNABLE TO PROTECT OUR PROPRIETARY RIGHTS TO THE TOTALITY OF THE FEATURES (INCLUDING ASPECTS

OF PRODUCTS PROTECTED OTHER THAN BY PATENT RIGHTS) IN A MARKET, WE MAY FIND OURSELVES AT A COMPETITIVE DISADVANTAGE TO OTHERS WHO NEED NOT INCUR THE SUBSTANTIAL EXPENSE, TIME, AND EFFORT REQUIRED TO CREATE INNOVATIVE PRODUCTS THAT HAVE ENABLED US TO

BE SUCCESSFUL.

WE MAY BE FOUND TO INFRINGE ON INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS OF OTHERS

THIRD PARTIES, INCLUDING CUSTOMERS, HAVE IN THE PAST AND MAY IN THE FUTURE ASSERT CLAIMS OR INITIATE LITIGATION RELATED TO EXCLUSIVE PATENT, COPYRIGHT,

TRADEMARK, AND OTHER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS TO TECHNOLOGIES AND RELATED STANDARDS THAT ARE RELEVANT TO US. THESE ASSERTIONS HAVE INCREASED OVER TIME AS A RESULT OF OUR GROWTH AND THE GENERAL INCREASE IN THE PACE OF PATENT CLAIMS ASSERTIONS,

PARTICULARLY IN THE UNITED STATES. BECAUSE OF THE EXISTENCE OF A LARGE NUMBER OF PATENTS IN THE NETWORKING FIELD, THE SECRECY OF SOME PENDING PATENTS, AND THE RAPID RATE OF ISSUANCE OF NEW PATENTS, IT IS NOT ECONOMICALLY PRACTICAL OR EVEN POSSIBLE

TO DETERMINE IN ADVANCE WHETHER A PRODUCT OR ANY OF ITS COMPONENTS INFRINGES OR WILL INFRINGE ON THE PATENT RIGHTS OF OTHERS. THE ASSERTED CLAIMS AND/OR INITIATED LITIGATION CAN INCLUDE CLAIMS AGAINST US OR OUR MANUFACTURERS, SUPPLIERS, OR

CUSTOMERS, ALLEGING INFRINGEMENT OF THEIR PROPRIETARY RIGHTS WITH RESPECT TO OUR EXISTING OR FUTURE PRODUCTS OR COMPONENTS OF THOSE PRODUCTS. REGARDLESS OF THE MERIT OF THESE CLAIMS, THEY CAN BE TIME-CONSUMING, RESULT IN COSTLY LITIGATION AND

DIVERSION OF TECHNICAL AND MANAGEMENT PERSONNEL, OR REQUIRE US TO DEVELOP A NON-INFRINGING TECHNOLOGY OR ENTER INTO LICENSE AGREEMENTS. WHERE CLAIMS ARE MADE BY CUSTOMERS, RESISTANCE EVEN TO UNMERITORIOUS CLAIMS COULD DAMAGE CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIPS.

THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT LICENSES WILL BE AVAILABLE ON ACCEPTABLE TERMS AND CONDITIONS, IF AT ALL, OR THAT OUR INDEMNIFICATION BY OUR SUPPLIERS WILL BE ADEQUATE TO COVER OUR COSTS IF A CLAIM WERE BROUGHT DIRECTLY AGAINST US OR OUR CUSTOMERS.

FURTHERMORE, BECAUSE OF THE POTENTIAL FOR HIGH COURT AWARDS THAT ARE NOT NECESSARILY PREDICTABLE, IT IS NOT UNUSUAL TO FIND EVEN ARGUABLY UNMERITORIOUS CLAIMS SETTLED FOR SIGNIFICANT AMOUNTS. IF ANY INFRINGEMENT OR OTHER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY CLAIM

MADE AGAINST US BY ANY THIRD PARTY IS SUCCESSFUL, IF WE ARE REQUIRED TO INDEMNIFY A CUSTOMER WITH RESPECT TO A CLAIM AGAINST THE CUSTOMER, OR IF WE FAIL TO DEVELOP NON-INFRINGING TECHNOLOGY OR LICENSE THE PROPRIETARY RIGHTS ON COMMERCIALLY

REASONABLE TERMS AND CONDITIONS, OUR BUSINESS, OPERATING RESULTS, AND FINANCIAL CONDITION COULD BE MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

OUR

EXPOSURE TO RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE USE OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY MAY BE INCREASED AS A RESULT OF ACQUISITIONS, AS WE HAVE A LOWER LEVEL OF VISIBILITY INTO THE DEVELOPMENT PROCESS WITH RESPECT TO SUCH TECHNOLOGY OR THE CARE TAKEN TO SAFEGUARD

AGAINST INFRINGEMENT RISKS. FURTHER, IN THE PAST, THIRD PARTIES HAVE MADE INFRINGEMENT AND SIMILAR CLAIMS AFTER WE HAVE ACQUIRED TECHNOLOGY THAT HAD NOT BEEN ASSERTED PRIOR TO OUR ACQUISITION.

WE RELY ON THE AVAILABILITY OF THIRD-PARTY LICENSES

MANY OF OUR PRODUCTS ARE DESIGNED TO INCLUDE SOFTWARE OR OTHER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY LICENSED FROM THIRD PARTIES. IT MAY BE NECESSARY IN THE FUTURE TO SEEK OR RENEW LICENSES RELATING TO VARIOUS ASPECTS OF THESE PRODUCTS. THERE CAN BE NO

ASSURANCE THAT THE NECESSARY LICENSES WOULD BE AVAILABLE ON ACCEPTABLE TERMS, IF AT ALL. THE INABILITY TO OBTAIN CERTAIN LICENSES OR OTHER RIGHTS OR TO OBTAIN SUCH LICENSES OR RIGHTS ON FAVORABLE TERMS, OR THE NEED TO ENGAGE IN LITIGATION REGARDING

THESE MATTERS, COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, OPERATING RESULTS, AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. MOREOVER, THE INCLUSION IN OUR PRODUCTS OF SOFTWARE OR OTHER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY LICENSED FROM THIRD PARTIES ON A NONEXCLUSIVE BASIS

COULD LIMIT OUR ABILITY TO PROTECT OUR PROPRIETARY RIGHTS IN OUR PRODUCTS.

OUR OPERATING RESULTS AND FUTURE PROSPECTS COULD BE MATERIALLY HARMED BY

UNCERTAINTIES OF REGULATION OF THE INTERNET

CURRENTLY, FEW LAWS OR REGULATIONS APPLY DIRECTLY TO ACCESS OR COMMERCE ON THE INTERNET. WE

COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY REGULATION OF THE INTERNET AND INTERNET COMMERCE IN ANY COUNTRY WHERE WE OPERATE. SUCH REGULATIONS COULD INCLUDE MATTERS SUCH AS VOICE OVER THE INTERNET OR USING IP, ENCRYPTION TECHNOLOGY, SALES TAXES ON

INTERNET PRODUCT SALES, AND ACCESS CHARGES FOR INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDERS. THE ADOPTION OF REGULATION OF THE INTERNET AND INTERNET COMMERCE COULD DECREASE DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS AND, AT THE SAME TIME, INCREASE THE COST OF SELLING OUR PRODUCTS,

WHICH COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, OPERATING RESULTS, AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

CHANGES IN TELECOMMUNICATIONS REGULATION AND

TARIFFS COULD HARM OUR PROSPECTS AND FUTURE SALES

CHANGES IN TELECOMMUNICATIONS REQUIREMENTS, OR REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS IN OTHER

INDUSTRIES IN WHICH WE OPERATE, IN THE UNITED STATES OR OTHER COUNTRIES COULD AFFECT THE SALES OF OUR PRODUCTS. IN PARTICULAR, WE BELIEVE THAT THERE MAY BE FUTURE CHANGES IN U.S. TELECOMMUNICATIONS REGULATIONS THAT COULD SLOW THE EXPANSION OF THE

SERVICE PROVIDERS NETWORK INFRASTRUCTURES AND MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, OPERATING RESULTS, AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

FUTURE CHANGES IN TARIFFS BY REGULATORY AGENCIES OR APPLICATION OF TARIFF REQUIREMENTS TO CURRENTLY UNTARIFFED SERVICES COULD AFFECT THE

20

TABLE OF CONTENTS

SALES OF OUR PRODUCTS FOR CERTAIN CLASSES OF CUSTOMERS. ADDITIONALLY, IN THE UNITED STATES, OUR PRODUCTS MUST COMPLY WITH VARIOUS FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS

COMMISSION REQUIREMENTS AND REGULATIONS. IN COUNTRIES OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES, OUR PRODUCTS MUST MEET VARIOUS REQUIREMENTS OF LOCAL TELECOMMUNICATIONS AUTHORITIES. CHANGES IN TARIFFS OR FAILURE BY US TO OBTAIN TIMELY APPROVAL OF PRODUCTS COULD

HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, OPERATING RESULTS, AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

FAILURE TO RETAIN AND RECRUIT KEY PERSONNEL WOULD HARM OUR

ABILITY TO MEET KEY OBJECTIVES

OUR SUCCESS HAS ALWAYS DEPENDED IN LARGE PART ON OUR ABILITY TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN HIGHLY SKILLED

TECHNICAL, MANAGERIAL, SALES, AND MARKETING PERSONNEL. COMPETITION FOR THESE PERSONNEL IS INTENSE, ESPECIALLY IN THE SILICON VALLEY AREA OF NORTHERN CALIFORNIA. STOCK OPTION GRANTS ARE DESIGNED TO REWARD EMPLOYEES FOR THEIR LONG-TERM CONTRIBUTIONS

AND PROVIDE INCENTIVES FOR THEM TO REMAIN WITH US. VOLATILITY, LACK OF POSITIVE PERFORMANCE IN OUR STOCK PRICE, OR CHANGES TO OUR OVERALL COMPENSATION PROGRAM, INCLUDING OUR STOCK INCENTIVE PROGRAM, RESULTING FROM THE ADOPTION OF SFAS 123(R) OR

OTHERWISE, MAY ALSO ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO RETAIN KEY EMPLOYEES. AS A RESULT OF ONE OR MORE OF THESE FACTORS, WE MAY INCREASE OUR HIRING IN GEOGRAPHIC AREAS OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES, WHICH COULD SUBJECT US TO ADDITIONAL GEOPOLITICAL AND

EXCHANGE RATE RISK. THE LOSS OF SERVICES OF ANY OF OUR KEY PERSONNEL, THE INABILITY TO RETAIN AND ATTRACT QUALIFIED PERSONNEL IN THE FUTURE, OR DELAYS IN HIRING REQUIRED PERSONNEL, PARTICULARLY ENGINEERING AND SALES PERSONNEL, COULD MAKE IT

DIFFICULT TO MEET KEY OBJECTIVES, SUCH AS TIMELY AND EFFECTIVE PRODUCT INTRODUCTIONS. IN ADDITION, COMPANIES IN THE NETWORKING INDUSTRY WHOSE EMPLOYEES ACCEPT POSITIONS WITH COMPETITORS FREQUENTLY CLAIM THAT COMPETITORS HAVE ENGAGED IN IMPROPER

HIRING PRACTICES. WE HAVE RECEIVED THESE CLAIMS IN THE PAST AND MAY RECEIVE ADDITIONAL CLAIMS TO THIS EFFECT IN THE FUTURE.

ADVERSE RESOLUTION OF

LITIGATION MAY HARM OUR OPERATING RESULTS OR FINANCIAL CONDITION

WE ARE A PARTY TO LAWSUITS IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF OUR BUSINESS.

LITIGATION CAN BE EXPENSIVE, LENGTHY, AND DISRUPTIVE TO NORMAL BUSINESS OPERATIONS. MOREOVER, THE RESULTS OF COMPLEX LEGAL PROCEEDINGS ARE DIFFICULT TO PREDICT. AN UNFAVORABLE RESOLUTION OF A PARTICULAR LAWSUIT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT

ON OUR BUSINESS, OPERATING RESULTS, OR FINANCIAL CONDITION. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING CERTAIN OF THE LAWSUITS IN WHICH WE ARE INVOLVED, SEE ITEM 3, LEGAL PROCEEDINGS, CONTAINED IN PART I OF THIS REPORT.

CHANGES IN OUR PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES OR ADVERSE OUTCOMES RESULTING FROM EXAMINATION OF OUR INCOME TAX RETURNS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS

OUR PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES IS SUBJECT TO VOLATILITY AND COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY EARNINGS BEING LOWER THAN ANTICIPATED IN COUNTRIES WHICH

HAVE LOWER TAX RATES AND HIGHER THAN ANTICIPATED IN COUNTRIES WHICH HAVE HIGHER TAX RATES; BY CHANGES IN THE VALUATION OF OUR DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES; BY EXPIRATION OF OR LAPSES IN THE R&D TAX CREDIT LAWS; BY TRANSFER PRICING

ADJUSTMENTS INCLUDING THE POST-ACQUISITION INTEGRATION OF PURCHASED INTANGIBLE ASSETS FROM CERTAIN ACQUISITIONS INTO OUR INTERCOMPANY R&D COST SHARING ARRANGEMENT; BY TAX EFFECTS OF SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION; BY COSTS RELATED TO INTERCOMPANY

RESTRUCTURINGS; OR BY CHANGES IN TAX LAWS, REGULATIONS, ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES, INCLUDING ACCOUNTING FOR UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS, OR INTERPRETATIONS THEREOF. FURTHER, AS A RESULT OF CERTAIN OF OUR ONGOING EMPLOYMENT AND CAPITAL INVESTMENT

ACTIONS AND COMMITMENTS, OUR INCOME IN CERTAIN COUNTRIES IS SUBJECT TO REDUCED TAX RATES, AND IN SOME CASES IS WHOLLY EXEMPT FROM TAX. OUR FAILURE TO MEET THESE COMMITMENTS COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES. IN ADDITION, WE ARE

SUBJECT TO THE CONTINUOUS EXAMINATION OF OUR INCOME TAX RETURNS BY THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE AND OTHER TAX AUTHORITIES. WE REGULARLY ASSESS THE LIKELIHOOD OF ADVERSE OUTCOMES RESULTING FROM THESE EXAMINATIONS TO DETERMINE THE ADEQUACY OF OUR

PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THE OUTCOMES FROM THESE CONTINUOUS EXAMINATIONS WILL NOT HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR OPERATING RESULTS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

OUR BUSINESS AND OPERATIONS ARE ESPECIALLY SUBJECT TO THE RISKS OF EARTHQUAKES, FLOODS, AND OTHER NATURAL CATASTROPHIC EVENTS

OUR CORPORATE HEADQUARTERS, INCLUDING CERTAIN OF OUR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT OPERATIONS AND OUR MANUFACTURING FACILITIES, ARE LOCATED IN THE SILICON

VALLEY AREA OF NORTHERN CALIFORNIA, A REGION KNOWN FOR SEISMIC ACTIVITY. ADDITIONALLY, A CERTAIN NUMBER OF OUR FACILITIES, INCLUDING ONE OF OUR MANUFACTURING FACILITIES, ARE LOCATED NEAR RIVERS THAT HAVE EXPERIENCED FLOODING IN THE PAST. A

SIGNIFICANT NATURAL DISASTER, SUCH AS AN EARTHQUAKE, A HURRICANE, OR A FLOOD, COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR BUSINESS, OPERATING RESULTS, AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

MAN-MADE PROBLEMS SUCH AS COMPUTER VIRUSES OR TERRORISM MAY DISRUPT OUR OPERATIONS AND HARM OUR OPERATING RESULTS

DESPITE OUR IMPLEMENTATION OF NETWORK SECURITY MEASURES, OUR SERVERS ARE VULNERABLE TO COMPUTER VIRUSES, BREAK-INS, AND SIMILAR DISRUPTIONS FROM UNAUTHORIZED TAMPERING WITH OUR COMPUTER SYSTEMS. ANY SUCH EVENT COULD

HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, OPERATING RESULTS, AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. EFFORTS TO LIMIT THE ABILITY OF MALICIOUS THIRD PARTIES TO DISRUPT THE OPERATIONS OF

21

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE INTERNET OR UNDERMINE OUR OWN SECURITY EFFORTS MAY MEET WITH RESISTANCE. IN ADDITION, THE CONTINUED THREAT OF TERRORISM AND HEIGHTENED SECURITY AND

MILITARY ACTION IN RESPONSE TO THIS THREAT, OR ANY FUTURE ACTS OF TERRORISM, MAY CAUSE FURTHER DISRUPTIONS TO THE ECONOMIES OF THE UNITED STATES AND OTHER COUNTRIES AND CREATE FURTHER UNCERTAINTIES OR OTHERWISE MATERIALLY HARM OUR BUSINESS,

OPERATING RESULTS, AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. LIKEWISE, EVENTS SUCH AS WIDESPREAD BLACKOUTS COULD HAVE SIMILAR NEGATIVE IMPACTS. TO THE EXTENT THAT SUCH DISRUPTIONS OR UNCERTAINTIES RESULT IN DELAYS OR CANCELLATIONS OF CUSTOMER ORDERS OR THE

MANUFACTURE OR SHIPMENT OF OUR PRODUCTS, OUR BUSINESS, OPERATING RESULTS, AND FINANCIAL CONDITION COULD BE MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

WE ARE

EXPOSED TO FLUCTUATIONS IN THE MARKET VALUES OF OUR PORTFOLIO INVESTMENTS AND IN INTEREST RATES; IMPAIRMENT OF OUR INVESTMENTS COULD HARM OUR EARNINGS

WE MAINTAIN AN INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO OF VARIOUS HOLDINGS, TYPES, AND MATURITIES. THESE SECURITIES ARE GENERALLY CLASSIFIED AS AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE AND, CONSEQUENTLY, ARE RECORDED ON OUR CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS AT

FAIR VALUE WITH UNREALIZED GAINS OR LOSSES REPORTED AS A SEPARATE COMPONENT OF ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME, NET OF TAX. PART OF THIS PORTFOLIO INCLUDES EQUITY INVESTMENTS IN PUBLICLY TRADED COMPANIES, THE VALUES OF WHICH ARE SUBJECT TO

MARKET PRICE VOLATILITY TO THE EXTENT UNHEDGED. IF THE PUBLIC EQUITIES MARKET DECLINES, WE MAY RECOGNIZE IN EARNINGS THE DECLINE IN FAIR VALUE OF OUR PUBLICLY TRADED EQUITY INVESTMENTS BELOW THE COST BASIS WHEN THE DECLINE IS JUDGED TO BE

OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY. FOR INFORMATION REGARDING THE SENSITIVITY OF AND RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE MARKET VALUE OF PORTFOLIO INVESTMENTS AND INTEREST RATES, REFER TO THE SECTION TITLED QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET

RISK INCLUDED IN OUR 2007 ANNUAL REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS, WHICH SECTION IS INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE INTO THIS REPORT. OUR INVESTMENTS IN PRIVATE COMPANIES ARE SUBJECT TO RISK OF LOSS OF INVESTMENT CAPITAL. THESE INVESTMENTS ARE INHERENTLY

RISKY BECAUSE THE MARKETS FOR THE TECHNOLOGIES OR PRODUCTS THEY HAVE UNDER DEVELOPMENT ARE TYPICALLY IN THE EARLY STAGES AND MAY NEVER MATERIALIZE. WE COULD LOSE OUR ENTIRE INVESTMENT IN THESE COMPANIES.

IF WE DO NOT SUCCESSFULLY MANAGE OUR STRATEGIC ALLIANCES, WE MAY EXPERIENCE INCREASED COMPETITION OR DELAYS IN PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT

WE HAVE SEVERAL STRATEGIC ALLIANCES WITH LARGE AND COMPLEX ORGANIZATIONS AND OTHER COMPANIES WITH WHOM WE WORK TO OFFER COMPLEMENTARY PRODUCTS AND

SERVICES. THESE ARRANGEMENTS ARE GENERALLY LIMITED TO SPECIFIC PROJECTS, THE GOAL OF WHICH IS GENERALLY TO FACILITATE PRODUCT COMPATIBILITY AND ADOPTION OF INDUSTRY STANDARDS. IF SUCCESSFUL, THESE RELATIONSHIPS MAY BE MUTUALLY BENEFICIAL AND RESULT

IN INDUSTRY GROWTH. HOWEVER, THESE ALLIANCES CARRY AN ELEMENT OF RISK BECAUSE, IN MOST CASES, WE MUST COMPETE IN SOME BUSINESS AREAS WITH A COMPANY WITH WHICH WE HAVE A STRATEGIC ALLIANCE AND, AT THE SAME TIME, COOPERATE WITH THAT COMPANY IN OTHER

BUSINESS AREAS. ALSO, IF THESE COMPANIES FAIL TO PERFORM OR IF THESE RELATIONSHIPS FAIL TO MATERIALIZE AS EXPECTED, WE COULD SUFFER DELAYS IN PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT OR OTHER OPERATIONAL DIFFICULTIES.

WE ARE REQUIRED TO RECOGNIZE EXPENSE FOR SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION RELATED TO EMPLOYEE SHARE-BASED AWARDS, AND THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT THE EXPENSE THAT WE ARE

REQUIRED TO RECOGNIZE MEASURES ACCURATELY THE VALUE OF OUR SHARE-BASED PAYMENT AWARDS, AND THE RECOGNITION OF THIS EXPENSE COULD CAUSE THE TRADING PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK TO DECLINE

ON JULY 31, 2005, WE ADOPTED SFAS 123(R), WHICH REQUIRES THE MEASUREMENT AND RECOGNITION OF COMPENSATION EXPENSE FOR ALL SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION

BASED ON ESTIMATED FAIR VALUES. AS A RESULT, STARTING WITH FISCAL 2006, OUR OPERATING RESULTS CONTAIN A CHARGE FOR EMPLOYEE SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE. THIS CHARGE IS IN ADDITION TO SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE WE RECOGNIZED PRIOR TO

FISCAL 2006 RELATED TO ACQUISITIONS AND INVESTMENTS. THE APPLICATION OF SFAS 123(R) REQUIRES THE USE OF AN OPTION-PRICING MODEL TO DETERMINE THE FAIR VALUE OF SHARE-BASED PAYMENT AWARDS. THIS DETERMINATION OF FAIR VALUE IS AFFECTED BY OUR STOCK

PRICE AS WELL AS ASSUMPTIONS REGARDING A NUMBER OF HIGHLY COMPLEX AND SUBJECTIVE VARIABLES. THESE VARIABLES INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO, OUR EXPECTED STOCK PRICE VOLATILITY OVER THE TERM OF THE AWARDS, AND ACTUAL AND PROJECTED EMPLOYEE STOCK

OPTION EXERCISE BEHAVIORS. OPTION-PRICING MODELS WERE DEVELOPED FOR USE IN ESTIMATING THE VALUE OF TRADED OPTIONS THAT HAVE NO VESTING OR HEDGING RESTRICTIONS AND ARE FULLY TRANSFERABLE. BECAUSE OUR EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTIONS HAVE CERTAIN

CHARACTERISTICS THAT ARE SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT FROM TRADED OPTIONS, AND BECAUSE CHANGES IN THE SUBJECTIVE ASSUMPTIONS CAN MATERIALLY AFFECT THE ESTIMATED VALUE, IN MANAGEMENTS OPINION THE EXISTING VALUATION MODELS MAY NOT PROVIDE AN ACCURATE

MEASURE OF THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTIONS. ALTHOUGH THE FAIR VALUE OF EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTIONS IS DETERMINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH SFAS 123(R) AND SAB 107 USING AN OPTION-PRICING MODEL, THAT VALUE MAY NOT BE INDICATIVE OF THE FAIR VALUE

OBSERVED IN A WILLING BUYER/WILLING SELLER MARKET TRANSACTION.

AS A RESULT OF THE ADOPTION OF SFAS 123(R), BEGINNING WITH FISCAL 2006, OUR

EARNINGS WERE LOWER THAN THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN HAD WE NOT BEEN REQUIRED TO ADOPT SFAS 123(R). THIS WILL CONTINUE TO BE THE CASE FOR FUTURE PERIODS. WE CANNOT PREDICT THE EFFECT THAT THIS ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR REPORTED OPERATING RESULTS WILL HAVE ON

THE TRADING PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK.

22

TABLE OF CONTENTS

OUR STOCK PRICE MAY BE VOLATILE

HISTORICALLY, OUR COMMON STOCK HAS EXPERIENCED SUBSTANTIAL PRICE VOLATILITY, PARTICULARLY AS A RESULT OF VARIATIONS BETWEEN OUR ACTUAL FINANCIAL RESULTS AND THE PUBLISHED EXPECTATIONS OF ANALYSTS AND AS A RESULT OF

ANNOUNCEMENTS BY OUR COMPETITORS AND US. FURTHERMORE, SPECULATION IN THE PRESS OR INVESTMENT COMMUNITY ABOUT OUR STRATEGIC POSITION, FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, BUSINESS, SECURITY OF OUR PRODUCTS OR SIGNIFICANT TRANSACTIONS CAN CAUSE

CHANGES IN OUR STOCK PRICE. IN ADDITION, THE STOCK MARKET HAS EXPERIENCED EXTREME PRICE AND VOLUME FLUCTUATIONS THAT HAVE AFFECTED THE MARKET PRICE OF MANY TECHNOLOGY COMPANIES, IN PARTICULAR, AND THAT HAVE OFTEN BEEN UNRELATED TO THE OPERATING

PERFORMANCE OF THESE COMPANIES. THESE FACTORS, AS WELL AS GENERAL ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL CONDITIONS AND THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF PROPOSED AND COMPLETED ACQUISITIONS OR OTHER SIGNIFICANT TRANSACTIONS, OR ANY DIFFICULTIES ASSOCIATED WITH SUCH TRANSACTIONS,

BY US OR OUR CURRENT OR POTENTIAL COMPETITORS, MAY MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE MARKET PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK IN THE FUTURE. ADDITIONALLY, VOLATILITY, LACK OF POSITIVE PERFORMANCE IN OUR STOCK PRICE OR CHANGES TO OUR OVERALL COMPENSATION

PROGRAM INCLUDING OUR STOCK INCENTIVE PROGRAM MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO RETAIN KEY EMPLOYEES, VIRTUALLY ALL OF WHOM ARE COMPENSATED, IN PART, BASED ON THE PERFORMANCE OF OUR STOCK PRICE.

WE HAVE ISSUED $6.5 BILLION OF SENIOR UNSECURED NOTES, AND THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT OUR OPERATING RESULTS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION WILL NOT BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED

ON FEBRUARY 22, 2006, WE ISSUED SENIOR UNSECURED NOTES IN AN AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF $6.5 BILLION THAT MATURE AT SPECIFIC

DATES IN 2009, 2011 AND 2016. THE NOTES THAT MATURE IN 2009 BEAR FLOATING-RATE INTEREST PAYABLE QUARTERLY WHILE THE NOTES THAT MATURE IN 2011 AND 2016 BEAR FIXED-RATE INTEREST PAYABLE SEMI-ANNUALLY. WE HAVE ENTERED INTO CERTAIN INTEREST RATE SWAPS

TO, IN EFFECT, CONVERT THE INTEREST RATES OF THE FIXED INTEREST NOTES INTO FLOATING-RATES BASED ON LIBOR. HIGHER SHORT-TERM INTEREST RATES WOULD ACCORDINGLY RESULT IN INCREASED INTEREST EXPENSE. WHILE WE PRESENTLY MITIGATE THIS RISK BY INVESTING A

PORTION OF OUR INTEREST-BEARING ASSETS IN INSTRUMENTS WITH SIMILAR INTEREST RATE CHARACTERISTICS AS THE SWAPPED DEBT, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL MAINTAIN A MATCHED PORTFOLIO IN THE FUTURE. THE INSTRUMENTS GOVERNING THE NOTES CONTAIN

CERTAIN COVENANTS APPLICABLE TO US AND OUR SUBSIDIARIES THAT MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO INCUR CERTAIN LIENS OR ENGAGE IN CERTAIN TYPES OF SALE AND LEASEBACK TRANSACTIONS. WE HAVE NOT PREVIOUSLY UNDERTAKEN SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNTS OF DEBT FOR

BORROWED MONEY. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT OUR INCURRENCE OF THIS DEBT WILL BE A BETTER MEANS OF PROVIDING LIQUIDITY TO US THAN WOULD OUR USE OF OUR EXISTING CASH RESOURCES, INCLUDING CASH CURRENTLY HELD OFFSHORE. FURTHER, WE CANNOT BE ASSURED

THAT OUR MAINTENANCE OF THIS INDEBTEDNESS WILL NOT ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR OPERATING RESULTS OR FINANCIAL CONDITION. IN ADDITION, CHANGES BY ANY RATING AGENCY TO OUR CREDIT RATING CAN NEGATIVELY IMPACT THE VALUE AND LIQUIDITY OF BOTH OUR DEBT AND

EQUITY SECURITIES.

ITEM 2. PROPERTIES

OUR HEADQUARTERS ARE LOCATED ON AN OWNED SITE IN SAN JOSE, CALIFORNIA. IN ADDITION TO

THIS SITE, WE OWN CERTAIN SITES IN THE UNITED STATES, WHICH INCLUDE FACILITIES IN THE SURROUNDING AREAS OF SAN JOSE, CALIFORNIA; BOXBOROUGH, MASSACHUSETTS; RICHARDSON, TEXAS; LAWRENCEVILLE, GEORGIA; AND RESEARCH TRIANGLE PARK, NORTH CAROLINA. WE

ALSO OWN LAND FOR EXPANSION IN SOME OF THESE LOCATIONS. IN ADDITION, WE ALSO LEASE OFFICE SPACE IN SEVERAL U.S. LOCATIONS.

OUTSIDE THE

UNITED STATES OUR OPERATIONS ARE CONDUCTED PRIMARILY IN LEASED SITES, AND TO A LESSER EXTENT IN OWNED SITES. SIGNIFICANT SITES INCLUDE AUSTRALIA, CANADA, CHINA, FRANCE, GERMANY, INDIA, ISRAEL, JAPAN, NETHERLANDS, SINGAPORE, AND THE UNITED KINGDOM,

AMONG OTHERS.

WE OWN AND LEASE THE SCIENTIFIC-ATLANTA MANUFACTURING FACILITIES, WITH A PRINCIPAL MANUFACTURING FACILITY LOCATED IN JUAREZ,

MEXICO. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR EXISTING PROPERTIES, INCLUDING BOTH OWNED AND LEASED, ARE IN GOOD CONDITION AND SUITABLE FOR THE CONDUCT OF OUR BUSINESS.

ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

WE AND OTHER DEFENDANTS WERE SUBJECT TO PATENT CLAIMS ASSERTED BY QPSX

DEVELOPMENTS 5 PTY LTD (NOW KNOWN AS IPERNICA LTD) AGAINST US AND SUCH OTHER DEFENDANTS ON JUNE 21, 2005 IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF TEXAS. QPSX ALLEGED THAT VARIOUS CISCO SWITCHES AND ROUTERS INFRINGED

UNITED STATES PATENT NO. 5,689,499 AND SOUGHT DAMAGES AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF. ON APRIL 10, 2007, PRIOR TO TRIAL, WE AND QPSX SETTLED OUR DISPUTE ON TERMS THAT ARE NOT MATERIAL TO US, AND THE LAWSUIT WAS DISMISSED WITH PREJUDICE ON

MAY 2, 2007.

WE AND OTHER DEFENDANTS WERE SUBJECT TO CLAIMS ASSERTED BY TELCORDIA TECHNOLOGIES, INC. ON JULY 16, 2004 IN THE

FEDERAL DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE ALLEGING THAT VARIOUS CISCO ROUTERS, SWITCHES AND OPTICAL PRODUCTS INFRINGED UNITED STATES PATENT NOS. 4,893,306, 4,835,763 AND RE 36,633. TELCORDIA SOUGHT DAMAGES AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF. THE COURT

RULED THAT, AS A MATTER OF LAW, WE DO NOT INFRINGE PATENT NO. 4,893,306. AFTER CONCLUSION OF A TRIAL, ON MAY 10, 2007, A JURY FOUND THAT INFRINGEMENT HAD OCCURRED AND AWARDED DAMAGES IN AN AMOUNT THAT IS NOT MATERIAL TO US. WE HAVE ASKED

THE COURT TO REVERSE THE VERDICT AS A MATTER OF LAW, AND IF NECESSARY, WE INTEND TO APPEAL THE DECISION. TELCORDIA HAS ASKED THE COURT TO ENHANCE DAMAGES AND AWARD IT ATTORNEYS FEES AND ALSO HAS THE RIGHT TO APPEAL. WE BELIEVE THAT THE

ULTIMATE OUTCOME OF THIS MATTER AND AGGREGATE POTENTIAL DAMAGES WILL NOT BE MATERIAL.

IN SEPTEMBER 2005, SCIENTIFIC-ATLANTA, INC. (WHICH

SUBSEQUENTLY WAS ACQUIRED BY US) AND ANOTHER PLAINTIFF FILED A DECLARATORY JUDGMENT ACTION AGAINST FORGENT NETWORKS IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF TEXAS AFTER FORGENT SUED VARIOUS SCIENTIFIC-ATLANTA CUSTOMERS. IN THE

ACTION, SCIENTIFIC-ATLANTA ASSERTED THAT ITS PRODUCTS DID NOT INFRINGE FORGENTS UNITED STATES PATENT NO. 6,285,746 AND THAT THE PATENT WAS INVALID. ON OCTOBER 20, 2005, FORGENT RESPONDED TO THE COMPLAINT AND ALLEGED THAT VARIOUS

SCIENTIFIC-ATLANTA DIGITAL VIDEO RECORDERS INFRINGED THE PATENT AND SOUGHT DAMAGES AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF. SUBSEQUENT TO THAT, ANOTHER DECLARATORY JUDGMENT PLAINTIFF MOVED TO INTERVENE AND THE CASES WERE COMBINED. ON APRIL 25, 2007, PRIOR TO

TRIAL, SCIENTIFIC-ATLANTA AND FORGENT SETTLED THEIR DISPUTE ON TERMS THAT ARE NOT MATERIAL TO US, AND THE LAWSUITS WERE DISMISSED WITH PREJUDICE ON APRIL 30, 2007.

IN ADDITION, WE ARE SUBJECT TO LEGAL PROCEEDINGS, CLAIMS, AND LITIGATION ARISING IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS, INCLUDING INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY LITIGATION. WHILE THE OUTCOME OF THESE MATTERS IS CURRENTLY NOT

DETERMINABLE, WE DO NOT EXPECT THAT THE ULTIMATE COSTS TO RESOLVE THESE MATTERS WILL HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL POSITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, OR CASH FLOWS. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING INTELLECTUAL

PROPERTY LITIGATION, SEE PART I, ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORSWE MAY BE FOUND TO INFRINGE ON INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS OF OTHERS HEREIN.

ADDITIONAL $5 BILLION OF OUR COMMON STOCK WITH NO TERMINATION DATE. DURING FISCAL 2007, WE REPURCHASED AND RETIRED 297 MILLION SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK AT AN AVERAGE PRICE OF $26.12 PER SHARE FOR AN AGGREGATE PURCHASE PRICE OF $7.8 BILLION.

AS OF JULY 28, 2007, WE HAD REPURCHASED AND RETIRED 2.2 BILLION SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK AT AN AVERAGE PRICE OF $19.40 PER SHARE FOR AN AGGREGATE PURCHASE PRICE OF $43.2 BILLION SINCE INCEPTION OF THE STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM, AND THE

REMAINING AUTHORIZED AMOUNT FOR STOCK REPURCHASES UNDER THIS PROGRAM WAS $8.8 BILLION WITH NO TERMINATION DATE.
