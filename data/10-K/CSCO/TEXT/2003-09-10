PRODUCTS AND SERVICES

WE SELL SCALABLE,

STANDARDS-BASED NETWORKING PRODUCTS THAT COVER A WIDE RANGE OF CUSTOMERS NETWORKING NEEDS. OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES HELP CUSTOMERS BUILD THEIR OWN NETWORK INFRASTRUCTURES WHILE PROVIDING TOOLS TO ALLOW THEM TO COMMUNICATE WITH KEY

STAKEHOLDERS, INCLUDING CUSTOMERS, PROSPECTS, BUSINESS PARTNERS, SUPPLIERS AND EMPLOYEES.

OUR PRODUCTS ARE USED INDIVIDUALLY OR IN COMBINATIONS TO CONNECT COMPUTING DEVICES TO NETWORKS OR COMPUTER NETWORKS WITH EACH OTHERWHETHER THEY ARE WITHIN A BUILDING, ACROSS A CAMPUS, OR AROUND THE WORLD. OUR

TELEPHONY, SECURITY, OPTICAL NETWORKING, STORAGE AREA NETWORKING, WIRELESS TECHNOLOGY, AND HOME NETWORKING, ALTHOUGH OVER TIME, ADDITIONAL ADVANCED TECHNOLOGIES MAY BE IDENTIFIED FOR FOCUS AND INVESTMENT. IN ADDITION, INVESTMENTS MAY BE CURTAILED OR

ELIMINATED IN SOME PRESENTLY IDENTIFIED ADVANCED TECHNOLOGIES DEPENDING ON MARKET DEVELOPMENTS AND RESOURCE ALLOCATION DECISIONS.

OVER TIME, WE BELIEVE THAT THE INTERNET AND THE VARIOUS NETWORKS ASSOCIATED WITH IT, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO CORPORATE INTRANETS, CABLE, BROADBAND AND DIALUP

NETWORKS, AND VOICE AND VIDEO NETWORKS, WILL CONVERGE INTO A NETWORK OF NETWORKS. IN THAT ENVIRONMENT, WE BELIEVE SUCCESSFUL VENDORS WILL BE CAPABLE OF PROVIDING AN END-TO-END SPECTRUM OF PRODUCTS AIMED NOT AT A PARTICULAR TECHNOLOGY

PLATFORM BUT AT SOLUTIONS TO NETWORKING PROBLEMS THAT SPAN ALL THE SEGMENTS THAT CURRENTLY DEFINE THE INDUSTRY. AS SUCH, MANY OF OUR STRATEGIC INITIATIVES AND INVESTMENTS ARE AIMED AT MEETING THE REQUIREMENTS THAT SUCH A NETWORK OF NETWORKS WOULD

DEMAND. FOR A DISCUSSION OF THE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THAT STRATEGY, PLEASE SEE THE SECTION OF THIS REPORT ENTITLED RISK FACTORS, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE RISK FACTOR ENTITLED, WE DEPEND UPON THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW PRODUCTS

AND ENHANCEMENTS TO EXISTING PRODUCTS, AND IF WE FAIL TO PREDICT AND RESPOND TO EMERGING TECHNOLOGICAL TRENDS AND CUSTOMERS CHANGING NEEDS, OUR OPERATING RESULTS AND MARKET SHARE MAY SUFFER. FOR INFORMATION REGARDING SALES OF OUR MAJOR

PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, SEE NOTE 12 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN OUR 2003 ANNUAL REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS, WHICH IS INCORPORATED INTO THIS REPORT BY REFERENCE.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

ACQUISITIONS, INVESTMENTS AND ALLIANCES

THE

MARKETS IN WHICH WE COMPETE REQUIRE A WIDE VARIETY OF TECHNOLOGIES, PRODUCTS AND CAPABILITIES. THE COMBINATION OF TECHNOLOGICAL COMPLEXITY AND RAPID CHANGE WITHIN OUR MARKETS MAKE IT DIFFICULT FOR A SINGLE COMPANY TO DEVELOP ALL TECHNOLOGICAL

SOLUTIONS THAT IT DESIRES TO OFFER WITHIN ITS FAMILY OF PRODUCT AND SERVICES. THROUGH ACQUISITIONS, INVESTMENTS AND ALLIANCES WE ARE ABLE TO DELIVER A BROADER RANGE OF PRODUCTS AND SERVICES TO CUSTOMERS IN TARGET MARKETS.

WE EMPLOY THE FOLLOWING STRATEGIES TO SATISFY THE NEED FOR NEW OR ENHANCED NETWORKING

PRODUCTS AND SOLUTIONS: WE DEVELOP NEW TECHNOLOGIES AND PRODUCTS INTERNALLY; WE ENTER INTO JOINT-DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS WITH OTHER COMPANIES; WE RESELL OTHER COMPANIES PRODUCTS; AND WE ACQUIRE ALL OR PART OF OTHER COMPANIES.

ACQUISITIONS

SINCE 1993, WE HAVE ACQUIRED SEVERAL COMPANIES AND WE EXPECT TO MAKE FUTURE ACQUISITIONS. MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS OF HIGH-TECHNOLOGY

COMPANIES ARE INHERENTLY RISKY, ESPECIALLY IF NO PRODUCT HAS BEEN SHIPPED BY THE ACQUIRED COMPANY. NO ASSURANCE CAN BE GIVEN THAT OUR PREVIOUS OR FUTURE ACQUISITIONS WILL BE SUCCESSFUL OR WILL NOT MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION

OR OPERATING RESULTS. PRIOR ACQUISITIONS HAVE RESULTED IN A WIDE RANGE OF OUTCOMES, FROM SUCCESSFUL INTRODUCTION OF NEW PRODUCTS AND TECHNOLOGIES TO AN INABILITY TO DO SO. THE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH ACQUISITIONS ARE MORE FULLY DISCUSSED IN THE

SECTION OF THIS REPORT ENTITLED RISK FACTORS, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE RISK FACTOR ENTITLED, WE HAVE MADE AND EXPECT TO CONTINUE TO MAKE ACQUISITIONS THAT COULD DISRUPT OUR OPERATIONS AND HARM OUR OPERATING RESULTS.

INVESTMENTS IN PRIVATELY HELD COMPANIES

WE MAKE MINORITY INVESTMENTS IN PRIVATELY HELD COMPANIES THAT DEVELOP TECHNOLOGY OR PROVIDE

SERVICES THAT ARE COMPLEMENTARY TO OUR PRODUCTS OR PROVIDE STRATEGIC VALUE. BY INVESTING IN NEW VENTURES, WE STRENGTHEN OUR RELATIONSHIPS WITH SUCH COMPANIES. THE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THESE INVESTMENTS ARE MORE FULLY DISCUSSED IN THE SECTION OF THE

REPORT ENTITLED RISK FACTORS, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE RISK FACTOR ENTITLED, WE ARE EXPOSED TO FLUCTUATIONS IN THE MARKET VALUES OF OUR PORTFOLIO INVESTMENTS AND IN INTEREST RATES; IMPAIRMENT OF OUR INVESTMENTS COULD HARM

OUR EARNINGS.

STRATEGIC ALLIANCES

WE PURSUE STRATEGIC ALLIANCES WITH OTHER COMPANIES IN AREAS WHERE COLLABORATION CAN PRODUCE

INDUSTRY ADVANCEMENT AND ACCELERATION OF NEW MARKETS. THE OBJECTIVES AND GOALS FOR A STRATEGIC ALLIANCE CAN INCLUDE ONE OR MORE OF THE FOLLOWING: TECHNOLOGY EXCHANGE, PRODUCT AND SOLUTION DEVELOPMENT, JOINT SALES AND MARKETING, OR NEW-MARKET

CREATION. CURRENTLY, WE HAVE STRATEGIC ALLIANCES WITH AT&T, BEARINGPOINT, BELL SOUTH, CAP GEMINI/ERNST & YOUNG, EDS, HEWLETT-PACKARD, IBM, INTEL, ITALTEL, MICROSOFT, MOTOROLA, SBC AND SPRINT, AMONG OTHERS.

BACKLOG

OUR BACKLOG AT JULY 26, 2003 WAS

APPROXIMATELY $2.0 BILLION, COMPARED WITH A BACKLOG OF APPROXIMATELY $2.3 BILLION AT JULY 27, 2002. OUR BACKLOG AT SEPTEMBER 8, 2003 WAS APPROXIMATELY $1.6 BILLION, COMPARED WITH A BACKLOG OF APPROXIMATELY $1.4 BILLION AT SEPTEMBER 9, 2002. BACKLOG

INCLUDES ORDERS CONFIRMED WITH A PURCHASE ORDER FOR PRODUCTS SCHEDULED TO BE SHIPPED WITHIN 90 DAYS TO CUSTOMERS WITH APPROVED CREDIT STATUS. BECAUSE OF THE GENERALLY SHORT CYCLE BETWEEN ORDER AND SHIPMENT AND OCCASIONAL CUSTOMER CHANGES IN DELIVERY

SCHEDULES OR CANCELLATION OF ORDERS (WHICH ARE MADE WITHOUT SIGNIFICANT PENALTY), WE DO NOT BELIEVE THAT OUR BACKLOG, AS OF ANY PARTICULAR DATE, IS NECESSARILY INDICATIVE OF ACTUAL NET SALES FOR ANY FUTURE PERIOD.

COMPETITION

WE COMPETE IN THE NETWORKING AND

COMMUNICATIONS EQUIPMENT MARKETS, PROVIDING PRODUCTS AND SERVICES FOR TRANSPORTING DATA, VOICE AND VIDEO TRAFFIC ACROSS INTRANETS, EXTRANETS, AND THE INTERNET. THESE MARKETS ARE CHARACTERIZED BY RAPID CHANGE, CONVERGING TECHNOLOGIES, AND A MIGRATION

TO NETWORKING SOLUTIONS THAT OFFER SUPERIOR ADVANTAGES. THESE MARKET FACTORS REPRESENT BOTH AN OPPORTUNITY AND A COMPETITIVE THREAT TO US. WE COMPETE WITH NUMEROUS VENDORS IN EACH PRODUCT CATEGORY. THE OVERALL NUMBER OF OUR COMPETITORS PROVIDING

NICHE PRODUCT SOLUTIONS MAY INCREASE. ALSO, THE COMPOSITION OF COMPETITORS MAY CHANGE AS WE INCREASE OUR ACTIVITY IN OUR ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY MARKETS.

OUR COMPETITORS INCLUDE 3COM, ALCATEL, AVAYA, AVICI, CHECK POINT SOFTWARE, CIENA, DELL, ERICSSON, ENTERASYS, EXTREME NETWORKS, FOUNDRY NETWORKS, FUJITSU, HUAWEI, JUNIPER,

LUCENT, NETSCREEN, NOKIA, NORTEL NETWORKS, REDBACK NETWORKS, RIVERSTONE, SIEMENS AG AND SYCAMORE NETWORKS, AMONG OTHERS. SOME OF THESE COMPANIES COMPETE ACROSS MANY OF OUR PRODUCT LINES, WHILE OTHERS ARE PRIMARILY FOCUSED IN A SPECIFIC PRODUCT AREA.

BARRIERS TO ENTRY ARE RELATIVELY LOW, AND NEW VENTURES TO CREATE PRODUCTS THAT DO OR COULD COMPETE WITH OUR PRODUCTS ARE REGULARLY FORMED. IN ADDITION, SEVERAL OF OUR COMPETITORS MAY HAVE GREATER RESOURCES, INCLUDING TECHNICAL AND ENGINEERING

RESOURCES, THAN WE DO. AS WE EXPAND INTO NEW MARKETS, WE WILL FACE COMPETITION NOT ONLY FROM OUR EXISTING COMPETITORS BUT FROM OTHER COMPETITORS AS WELL, INCLUDING EXISTING COMPANIES WITH STRONG TECHNOLOGICAL, MARKETING AND SALES POSITIONS IN THOSE

MARKETS. WE ALSO SOMETIMES FACE COMPETITION FROM RESELLERS AND DISTRIBUTORS OF OUR PRODUCTS.

THE PRINCIPAL COMPETITIVE FACTORS IN THE MARKETS IN WHICH WE PRESENTLY COMPETE AND MAY COMPETE IN THE FUTURE INCLUDE.



THE ABILITY TO PROVIDE A BROAD RANGE OF NETWORKING PRODUCTS AND SERVICES;



PRODUCT PERFORMANCE;



PRICE;



THE ABILITY TO PROVIDE NEW PRODUCTS;



THE ABILITY TO PROVIDE VALUE-ADDED FEATURES SUCH AS SECURITY, RELIABILITY AND INVESTMENT PROTECTION;



CONFORMANCE TO STANDARDS;



MARKET PRESENCE; AND



THE ABILITY TO PROVIDE FINANCING.

10

TABLE OF CONTENTS

WE ALSO FACE COMPETITION FROM CUSTOMERS TO WHOM WE LICENSE OR SUPPLY TECHNOLOGY AND SUPPLIERS FROM WHOM WE TRANSFER

TECHNOLOGY. THE INHERENT NATURE OF NETWORKING REQUIRES INTEROPERABILITY. AS SUCH, WE MUST COOPERATE AND AT THE SAME TIME COMPETE WITH MANY COMPANIES. ANY INABILITY TO EFFECTIVELY MANAGE THESE COMPLICATED RELATIONSHIPS WITH CUSTOMERS AND SUPPLIERS

COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, OPERATING RESULTS, AND FINANCIAL CONDITION AND ACCORDINGLY AFFECT OUR CHANCES OF SUCCESS.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

WE REGULARLY SEEK TO

INTRODUCE NEW PRODUCTS AND FEATURES IN AREAS INCLUDING, AMONG OTHERS, DATA, VOICE, AND VIDEO OVER IP; ADVANCED ACCESS AND AGGREGATION TECHNOLOGIES SUCH AS CABLE, WIRELESS AND OTHER BROADBAND TECHNOLOGIES; ADVANCED ENTERPRISE SWITCHING; OPTICAL

TRANSPORT; STORAGE NETWORKING; CONTENT NETWORKING; SECURITY; NETWORK MANAGEMENT; AND ADVANCED CORE AND EDGE ROUTING TECHNOLOGIES.

THE INDUSTRY IN WHICH WE COMPETE IS SUBJECT TO RAPID TECHNOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENTS, EVOLVING INDUSTRY STANDARDS, CHANGES IN CUSTOMER REQUIREMENTS, AND NEW PRODUCT

INTRODUCTIONS AND ENHANCEMENTS. AS A RESULT, OUR SUCCESS, IN PART, DEPENDS UPON OUR ABILITY, ON A COST-EFFECTIVE AND TIMELY BASIS, TO CONTINUE TO ENHANCE OUR EXISTING PRODUCTS AND TO DEVELOP AND INTRODUCE NEW PRODUCTS THAT IMPROVE PERFORMANCE AND

REDUCE TOTAL COST OF OWNERSHIP. IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE THESE OBJECTIVES, OUR MANAGEMENT AND ENGINEERING PERSONNEL WORK WITH CUSTOMERS TO IDENTIFY AND RESPOND TO CUSTOMER NEEDS, AS WELL AS WITH OTHER INNOVATORS OF INTERNETWORKING PRODUCTS, INCLUDING

UNIVERSITIES, LABORATORIES, AND CORPORATIONS. WE ALSO EXPECT TO CONTINUE TO MAKE ACQUISITIONS AND INVESTMENTS WHERE APPROPRIATE TO PROVIDE US WITH ACCESS TO NEW TECHNOLOGIES. WE INTEND TO CONTINUE DEVELOPING PRODUCTS THAT MEET KEY INDUSTRY STANDARDS

AND TO SUPPORT IMPORTANT PROTOCOL STANDARDS AS THEY EMERGE. STILL, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY DEVELOP PRODUCTS TO ADDRESS NEW CUSTOMER REQUIREMENTS AND TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGES, OR THAT SUCH PRODUCTS WILL ACHIEVE

MARKET ACCEPTANCE.

OUR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENDITURES WERE $3.1

BILLION, $3.4 BILLION AND $3.9 BILLION IN FISCAL 2003, 2002 AND 2001, RESPECTIVELY. ALL OF OUR EXPENDITURES FOR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS, AS WELL AS IN-PROCESS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT OF $4 MILLION, $65 MILLION AND $855 MILLION IN FISCAL

2003, 2002 AND 2001, RESPECTIVELY, HAVE BEEN EXPENSED AS INCURRED.

MANUFACTURING

WE PRIMARILY EMPLOY AN OUTSOURCED

MANUFACTURING STRATEGY THAT RELIES ON CONTRACT MANUFACTURERS FOR MANUFACTURING SERVICES. OUR MANUFACTURING OPERATIONS PRIMARILY CONSIST OF QUALITY ASSURANCE OF MATERIALS AND COMPONENTS, SUBASSEMBLIES, FINAL ASSEMBLY AND TESTING OF PRODUCTS. WE

PRESENTLY USE A VARIETY OF INDEPENDENT THIRD-PARTY COMPANIES TO PROVIDE SERVICES RELATED TO PRINTED CIRCUIT BOARD ASSEMBLY, IN-CIRCUIT TEST, AND PRODUCT REPAIR AS WELL AS PRODUCT ASSEMBLY. PROPRIETARY SOFTWARE ON ELECTRONICALLY PROGRAMMABLE MEMORY

CHIPS IS INSTALLED IN OUR SYSTEMS IN ORDER TO CONFIGURE PRODUCTS TO CUSTOMER NEEDS AND TO MAINTAIN QUALITY CONTROL AND SECURITY. THE MANUFACTURING PROCESS ENABLES US TO CONFIGURE THE HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE IN UNIQUE COMBINATIONS TO MEET A WIDE

VARIETY OF INDIVIDUAL CUSTOMER REQUIREMENTS. WE ALSO USE AUTOMATED TESTING EQUIPMENT AND BURN-IN PROCEDURES, AS WELL AS COMPREHENSIVE INSPECTION,

11

TABLE OF CONTENTS

TESTING, AND STATISTICAL PROCESS CONTROL THAT ARE DESIGNED TO HELP ENSURE THE QUALITY AND RELIABILITY OF OUR PRODUCTS.

THE MANUFACTURING PROCESSES AND PROCEDURES ARE GENERALLY ISO 9001 OR ISO 9003 CERTIFIED.

OUR ARRANGEMENTS WITH CONTRACT MANUFACTURERS GENERALLY PROVIDE FOR QUALITY, COST AND DELIVERY REQUIREMENTS, AS WELL AS MANUFACTURING PROCESS TERMS, SUCH AS CONTINUITY OF SUPPLY, INVENTORY MANAGEMENT, FLEXIBILITY

REGARDING CAPACITY, QUALITY AND COST MANAGEMENT, OVERSIGHT OF MANUFACTURING AND CONDITIONS FOR USE OF OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY. WE HAVE NOT ENTERED INTO ANY SIGNIFICANT LONG-TERM CONTRACTS WITH ANY MANUFACTURING SERVICE PROVIDER. WE GENERALLY HAVE

THE OPTION TO RENEW ARRANGEMENTS ON AN AS NEEDED BASIS, PRIMARILY ANNUALLY. THESE ARRANGEMENTS GENERALLY DO NOT COMMIT US TO PURCHASE ANY PARTICULAR AMOUNT, OR ANY QUANTITIES BEYOND CERTAIN AMOUNTS COVERED BY ORDERS OR FORECASTS THAT WE SUBMIT

COVERING DISCRETE PERIODS OF TIME.

PATENTS, INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, AND LICENSING

WE

SEEK TO ESTABLISH AND MAINTAIN OUR PROPRIETARY RIGHTS IN OUR TECHNOLOGY AND PRODUCTS THROUGH THE USE OF PATENTS, COPYRIGHTS, TRADEMARKS, AND TRADE SECRET LAWS. WE HAVE A PROGRAM TO FILE APPLICATIONS FOR AND OBTAIN PATENTS, COPYRIGHTS, AND TRADEMARKS

IN THE UNITED STATES AND IN SELECTED FOREIGN COUNTRIES WHERE WE BELIEVE FILING FOR SUCH PROTECTION IS APPROPRIATE. WE ALSO SEEK TO MAINTAIN OUR TRADE SECRETS AND CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION BY NON-DISCLOSURE POLICIES AND THROUGH THE USE OF APPROPRIATE

CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENTS. WE HAVE OBTAINED A SUBSTANTIAL NUMBER OF PATENTS AND TRADEMARKS IN THE UNITED STATES AND IN OTHER COUNTRIES. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE, HOWEVER, THAT THESE PATENTS ARE VALID OR CAN BE ENFORCED AGAINST COMPETITIVE PRODUCTS

IN EVERY JURISDICTION. ALTHOUGH WE BELIEVE THE PROTECTION AFFORDED BY OUR PATENTS, PATENT APPLICATIONS, COPYRIGHTS, TRADEMARKS AND TRADE SECRETS HAS VALUE, THE RAPIDLY CHANGING TECHNOLOGY IN THE NETWORKING INDUSTRY AND UNCERTAINTIES IN THE LEGAL

PROCESS MAKE OUR FUTURE SUCCESS DEPENDENT PRIMARILY ON THE INNOVATIVE SKILLS, TECHNOLOGICAL EXPERTISE, AND MANAGEMENT ABILITIES OF OUR EMPLOYEES RATHER THAN ON THE PROTECTION AFFORDED BY PATENT, COPYRIGHT, TRADEMARK, AND TRADE SECRET LAWS.

MANY OF OUR PRODUCTS ARE DESIGNED TO INCLUDE SOFTWARE OR OTHER INTELLECTUAL

PROPERTY LICENSED FROM THIRD PARTIES. WHILE IT MAY BE NECESSARY IN THE FUTURE TO SEEK OR RENEW LICENSES RELATING TO VARIOUS ASPECTS OF OUR PRODUCTS, WE BELIEVE, BASED UPON PAST EXPERIENCE AND STANDARD INDUSTRY PRACTICE THAT SUCH LICENSES GENERALLY

COULD BE OBTAINED ON COMMERCIALLY REASONABLE TERMS. NONETHELESS, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THE NECESSARY LICENSES WOULD BE AVAILABLE ON ACCEPTABLE TERMS, IF AT ALL. OUR INABILITY TO OBTAIN CERTAIN LICENSES OR OTHER RIGHTS OR TO OBTAIN SUCH

LICENSES OR RIGHTS ON FAVORABLE TERMS, OR THE NEED TO ENGAGE IN LITIGATION REGARDING THESE MATTERS, COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, OPERATING RESULTS, AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. MOREOVER, INCLUSION IN OUR PRODUCTS OF SOFTWARE OR

OTHER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY LICENSED FROM THIRD PARTIES ON A NON-EXCLUSIVE BASIS CAN LIMIT OUR ABILITY TO PROTECT OUR PROPRIETARY RIGHTS IN OUR PRODUCTS.

THE INDUSTRY IN WHICH WE COMPETE IS CHARACTERIZED BY RAPIDLY CHANGING TECHNOLOGY, A LARGE NUMBER OF PATENTS, AND FREQUENT CLAIMS AND RELATED LITIGATION REGARDING PATENT

AND OTHER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT OUR PATENTS AND OTHER PROPRIETARY RIGHTS WILL NOT BE CHALLENGED, INVALIDATED OR CIRCUMVENTED, THAT OTHERS WILL NOT ASSERT INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS TO TECHNOLOGIES THAT ARE

RELEVANT TO US, OR THAT OUR RIGHTS WILL GIVE US A COMPETITIVE

ADVANTAGE. IN ADDITION, THE LAWS OF SOME FOREIGN COUNTRIES MAY NOT PROTECT OUR PROPRIETARY RIGHTS TO THE SAME EXTENT AS

THE LAWS OF THE UNITED STATES. THE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH PATENTS AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY ARE MORE FULLY DISCUSSED IN THE SECTION OF THIS REPORT ENTITLED RISK FACTORS, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE RISK FACTORS ENTITLED, OUR

PROPRIETARY RIGHTS MAY PROVE DIFFICULT TO ENFORCE, WE MAY BE FOUND TO INFRINGE ON INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS OF OTHERS AND WE RELY ON THE AVAILABILITY OF THIRD-PARTY LICENSES.

EMPLOYEES

AS OF JULY 26, 2003, WE HAD

APPROXIMATELY 34,000 EMPLOYEES, INCLUDING 6,000 IN MANUFACTURING AND SERVICE; 12,000 IN ENGINEERING; 13,000 IN SALES AND MARKETING; AND 3,000 IN FINANCE AND ADMINISTRATION. APPROXIMATELY 9,000 EMPLOYEES ARE IN LOCATIONS OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES. WE

CONSIDER THE RELATIONSHIPS WITH OUR EMPLOYEES TO BE POSITIVE. COMPETITION FOR TECHNICAL PERSONNEL IN THE INDUSTRY IN WHICH WE COMPETE IS INTENSE. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR FUTURE SUCCESS DEPENDS IN PART ON OUR CONTINUED ABILITY TO HIRE, ASSIMILATE, AND

RETAIN QUALIFIED PERSONNEL. TO DATE, WE BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN RECRUITING QUALIFIED EMPLOYEES, BUT THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL CONTINUE TO BE SUCCESSFUL IN THE FUTURE.

RISK FACTORS

SET FORTH BELOW AND ELSEWHERE IN

THIS REPORT AND IN OTHER DOCUMENTS WE FILE WITH THE SEC ARE RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES THAT COULD CAUSE ACTUAL RESULTS TO DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THE RESULTS CONTEMPLATED BY THE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS CONTAINED IN THIS REPORT.

OUR OPERATING RESULTS MAY FLUCTUATE IN FUTURE PERIODS, WHICH MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR

STOCK PRICE

OUR OPERATING RESULTS HAVE BEEN IN THE PAST, AND WILL

CONTINUE TO BE, SUBJECT TO QUARTERLY AND ANNUAL FLUCTUATIONS AS A RESULT OF A NUMBER OF FACTORS. THESE FACTORS INCLUDE.



FLUCTUATIONS IN DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, SUCH AS HAS OCCURRED IN THE LAST THREE YEARS, ESPECIALLY WITH RESPECT TO INTERNET BUSINESSES AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICE

PROVIDERS;



CHANGES IN SALES AND IMPLEMENTATION CYCLES FOR OUR PRODUCTS AND REDUCED VISIBILITY INTO OUR CUSTOMERS SPENDING PLANS AND ASSOCIATED REVENUE;



OUR ABILITY TO MAINTAIN APPROPRIATE INVENTORY LEVELS AND PURCHASE COMMITMENTS;



PRICE AND PRODUCT COMPETITION IN THE COMMUNICATIONS AND NETWORKING INDUSTRIES, WHICH CAN CHANGE RAPIDLY DUE TO TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATION;



THE OVERALL TREND TOWARD INDUSTRY CONSOLIDATION BOTH AMONG OUR COMPETITORS AND OUR CUSTOMERS;



THE INTRODUCTION AND MARKET ACCEPTANCE OF NEW TECHNOLOGIES AND PRODUCTS AND OUR SUCCESS IN NEW MARKETS, AS WELL AS THE ADOPTION OF NEW NETWORKING STANDARDS;



VARIATIONS IN SALES CHANNELS, PRODUCT COSTS, OR MIX OF PRODUCTS SOLD;



THE TIMING AND SIZE OF ORDERS FROM CUSTOMERS;



MANUFACTURING LEAD TIMES;



FLUCTUATIONS IN OUR GROSS MARGINS, AND THE FACTORS THAT CONTRIBUTE TO THIS AS DESCRIBED BELOW;



OUR ABILITY TO ACHIEVE TARGETED COST REDUCTIONS;



THE ABILITY OF OUR CUSTOMERS, CHANNEL PARTNERS AND SUPPLIERS TO OBTAIN FINANCING OR TO FUND CAPITAL EXPENDITURES;



THE TIMING AND AMOUNT OF EMPLOYER PAYROLL TAX TO BE PAID ON EMPLOYEES GAINS ON STOCK OPTIONS EXERCISED;



ACTUAL EVENTS, CIRCUMSTANCES, OUTCOMES, AND AMOUNTS DIFFERING FROM JUDGMENTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND ESTIMATES USED IN DETERMINING THE VALUES OF CERTAIN ASSETS (INCLUDING THE AMOUNTS OF

RELATED VALUATION ALLOWANCES), LIABILITIES AND OTHER ITEMS REFLECTED IN OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS;



HOW WELL WE EXECUTE ON OUR STRATEGY AND OPERATING PLANS; AND



CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING RULES, SUCH AS RECORDING EXPENSES FOR EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTION GRANTS.

AS A CONSEQUENCE, OPERATING RESULTS FOR A PARTICULAR FUTURE PERIOD ARE DIFFICULT TO PREDICT, AND THEREFORE, PRIOR RESULTS ARE NOT

NECESSARILY INDICATIVE OF RESULTS TO BE EXPECTED IN FUTURE PERIODS. ANY OF THE FOREGOING FACTORS, OR ANY OTHER FACTORS DISCUSSED ELSEWHERE HEREIN, COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

THAT COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR STOCK PRICE.

14

TABLE OF CONTENTS

OUR OPERATING RESULTS MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY THE UNCERTAIN GEOPOLITICAL ENVIRONMENT AND UNFAVORABLE ECONOMIC AND

MARKET CONDITIONS

ADVERSE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS WORLDWIDE HAVE CONTRIBUTED

TO SLOWDOWNS IN THE COMMUNICATIONS AND NETWORKING INDUSTRIES AND MAY CONTINUE TO IMPACT OUR BUSINESS, RESULTING IN.



REDUCED DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS AS A RESULT OF CONTINUED CONSTRAINTS ON INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY-RELATED CAPITAL SPENDING BY OUR CUSTOMERS, PARTICULARLY SERVICE PROVIDERS;



INCREASED PRICE COMPETITION FOR OUR PRODUCTS, NOT ONLY FROM OUR COMPETITORS BUT ALSO AS A CONSEQUENCE OF CUSTOMERS DISPOSING OF UNUTILIZED PRODUCTS;



INCREASED RISK OF EXCESS AND OBSOLETE INVENTORIES;



EXCESS FACILITIES AND MANUFACTURING CAPACITY; AND



HIGHER OVERHEAD COSTS AS A PERCENTAGE OF REVENUES.

RECENT TURMOIL IN THE GEOPOLITICAL ENVIRONMENT IN MANY PARTS OF THE WORLD, INCLUDING TERRORIST ACTIVITIES AND MILITARY ACTIONS, PARTICULARLY THE AFTERMATH OF THE WAR IN

IRAQ, MAY CONTINUE TO PUT PRESSURE ON GLOBAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS. IF THE ECONOMIC AND MARKET CONDITIONS IN THE UNITED STATES AND GLOBALLY DO NOT IMPROVE, OR IF THEY DETERIORATE FURTHER, WE MAY CONTINUE TO EXPERIENCE MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACTS ON OUR

BUSINESS, OPERATING RESULTS, AND FINANCIAL CONDITION AS A CONSEQUENCE OF THE ABOVE FACTORS OR OTHERWISE. WE DO NOT EXPECT THE TREND OF LOWER CAPITAL SPENDING AMONG SERVICE PROVIDERS TO REVERSE ITSELF IN THE NEAR TERM.

OUR REVENUES FOR A PARTICULAR PERIOD ARE DIFFICULT TO PREDICT, AND A SHORTFALL IN REVENUES

MAY HARM OUR OPERATING RESULTS

AS A RESULT OF A VARIETY OF FACTORS

DISCUSSED IN THIS REPORT, OUR REVENUES FOR A PARTICULAR QUARTER ARE DIFFICULT TO PREDICT. OUR NET SALES MAY GROW AT A SLOWER RATE THAN IN PAST PERIODS AND, IN PARTICULAR PERIODS, MAY DECLINE. OUR ABILITY TO MEET FINANCIAL EXPECTATIONS COULD ALSO BE

ADVERSELY AFFECTED IF THE NONLINEAR SALES PATTERN SEEN IN SOME OF OUR PAST QUARTERS RECURS IN FUTURE PERIODS. WE HAVE EXPERIENCED PERIODS OF TIME DURING WHICH SHIPMENTS EXCEEDED NET BOOKINGS, LEADING TO NONLINEARITY IN SHIPPING PATTERNS. THIS CAN

INCREASE COSTS, AS IRREGULAR SHIPMENT PATTERNS RESULT IN PERIODS OF UNDERUTILIZED CAPACITY AND PERIODS WHEN OVERTIME EXPENSES MAY BE INCURRED, AS WELL AS LEADING TO ADDITIONAL COSTS ARISING OUT OF INVENTORY MANAGEMENT.

IN ADDITION, TO IMPROVE CUSTOMER SATISFACTION, WE CONTINUE TO ATTEMPT TO REDUCE OUR

MANUFACTURING LEAD TIMES, WHICH MAY RESULT IN CORRESPONDING REDUCTIONS IN ORDER BACKLOG. A DECLINE IN BACKLOG LEVELS COULD RESULT IN MORE VARIABILITY AND LESS PREDICTABILITY IN OUR QUARTER-TO-QUARTER NET SALES AND OPERATING RESULTS. LONG

MANUFACTURING LEAD TIMES HAVE CAUSED OUR CUSTOMERS IN THE PAST TO PLACE THE SAME ORDER MULTIPLE TIMES WITHIN OUR VARIOUS SALES CHANNELS AND CANCEL THE DUPLICATIVE ORDERS WHEN THE PRODUCT IS RECEIVED, OR PLACE ORDERS WITH OTHER VENDORS WITH SHORTER

MANUFACTURING LEAD TIMES. SUCH MULTIPLE ORDERING (ALONG WITH OTHER FACTORS) MAY CAUSE DIFFICULTY IN PREDICTING OUR SALES AND, AS A RESULT, COULD IMPAIR OUR ABILITY TO MANAGE PARTS INVENTORY EFFECTIVELY.

15

TABLE OF CONTENTS

WE PLAN OUR OPERATING EXPENSE LEVELS BASED PRIMARILY ON FORECASTED REVENUE LEVELS. THESE EXPENSES AND THE IMPACT OF

LONG-TERM COMMITMENTS ARE RELATIVELY FIXED IN THE SHORT-TERM. A SHORTFALL IN REVENUE COULD LEAD TO OPERATING RESULTS BEING BELOW EXPECTATIONS AS WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO QUICKLY REDUCE THESE FIXED EXPENSES IN RESPONSE TO SHORT-TERM BUSINESS CHANGES.

ANY OF THE ABOVE FACTORS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR

OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL RESULTS.

WE EXPECT THAT GROSS MARGIN VARIABILITY

AND OUR RECENT LEVEL OF PRODUCT GROSS MARGIN MAY NOT BE SUSTAINABLE

ALTHOUGH WE HAVE EXPERIENCED INCREASING PRODUCT GROSS MARGINS, OUR RECENT LEVEL OF PRODUCT GROSS MARGINS MAY NOT BE SUSTAINABLE AND MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED IN THE FUTURE BY NUMEROUS FACTORS, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO.



CHANGES IN CUSTOMER, GEOGRAPHIC OR PRODUCT MIX, INCLUDING MIX OF CONFIGURATIONS WITHIN EACH PRODUCT GROUP;



INCREASES IN MATERIAL OR LABOR COSTS;



EXCESS INVENTORY;



OBSOLESCENCE CHARGES;



CHANGES IN SHIPMENT VOLUME;



LOSS OF COST SAVINGS DUE TO CHANGES IN COMPONENT PRICING OR CHARGES INCURRED DUE TO INVENTORY HOLDING PERIODS IF PARTS ORDERING DOES NOT CORRECTLY ANTICIPATE PRODUCT DEMAND;



INCREASED PRICE COMPETITION;



CHANGES IN DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS;



INCREASED WARRANTY COSTS;



HOW WELL WE EXECUTE ON OUR STRATEGY AND OPERATING PLANS; AND



INTRODUCTION OF NEW PRODUCTS OR ENTERING NEW MARKETS, AND DIFFERENT PRICING AND COST STRUCTURES OF NEW MARKETS.

CHANGES IN SERVICE GROSS MARGIN MAY RESULT FROM VARIOUS FACTORS SUCH AS CHANGES IN THE MIX

BETWEEN TECHNICAL SUPPORT SERVICES AND ADVANCED SERVICES, AS WELL AS THE TIMING OF TECHNICAL SUPPORT SERVICE CONTRACT INITIATIONS AND RENEWALS.

DISRUPTION OF OR CHANGES IN THE MIX OF OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES DISTRIBUTION MODEL OR CUSTOMER BASE COULD HARM OUR SALES AND MARGINS

IF WE FAIL TO MANAGE DISTRIBUTION OF OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES PROPERLY, OR IF OUR

DISTRIBUTORS FINANCIAL CONDITION OR OPERATIONS WEAKEN, OUR REVENUES AND GROSS MARGINS COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED. FURTHERMORE, A CHANGE IN THE MIX OF OUR CUSTOMERS BETWEEN SERVICE PROVIDER AND

16

TABLE OF CONTENTS

ENTERPRISE, OR A CHANGE IN THE MIX OF DIRECT AND INDIRECT SALES, COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR REVENUES AND GROSS MARGINS.

WE USE A VARIETY OF CHANNELS TO BRING OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES TO OUR

END-USER CUSTOMERS, INCLUDING SYSTEM INTEGRATORS, TWO-TIER DISTRIBUTORS AND DIRECT SALES. SYSTEM INTEGRATORS INTEGRATE OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES INTO AN OVERALL NETWORK SOLUTION THAT THEY TYPICALLY RESELL TO AN END USER. TWO-TIER DISTRIBUTORS STOCK

INVENTORY AND SELL TO RESELLERS WHO MAY THEMSELVES BE SYSTEM INTEGRATORS. DIRECT SALES OCCUR TO BOTH ENTERPRISE ACCOUNTS AND SERVICE PROVIDERS. A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES IS DISTRIBUTED THROUGH OUR CHANNEL PARTNERS AND THE

REMAINDER IS DISTRIBUTED THROUGH DIRECT SALES. IF SALES THROUGH INDIRECT CHANNELS INCREASE, THIS MAY LEAD TO GREATER DIFFICULTY IN FORECASTING THE MIX OF OUR PRODUCTS, AND TO A CERTAIN DEGREE, THE TIMING OF ORDERS FROM OUR CUSTOMERS.

HISTORICALLY, WE HAVE SEEN FLUCTUATIONS IN OUR GROSS MARGINS BASED ON CHANGES IN THE BALANCE

OF OUR DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS. ALTHOUGH VARIABILITY TO DATE HAS NOT BEEN SIGNIFICANT, BECAUSE EACH DISTRIBUTION CHANNEL HAS A UNIQUE PROFILE, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT CHANGES IN THE BALANCE OF OUR DISTRIBUTION MODEL IN FUTURE PERIODS WOULD NOT

HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR GROSS MARGINS AND PROFITABILITY.

FOR EXAMPLE.



WE COULD COMPETE WITH OUR CHANNEL PARTNERS THROUGH OUR DIRECT SALES, WHICH MAY LEAD THESE CHANNEL PARTNERS TO USE OTHER SUPPLIERS THAT DO NOT DIRECTLY SELL THEIR OWN PRODUCTS, WHICH

COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR DISTRIBUTION MODEL.



SOME OF OUR SYSTEM INTEGRATORS MAY DEMAND THAT WE ABSORB A GREATER SHARE OF THE RISKS THAT THEIR CUSTOMERS MAY ASK THEM TO BEAR, WHICH MAY AFFECT OUR GROSS MARGIN.



SOME OF OUR CHANNEL PARTNERS MAY HAVE INSUFFICIENT FINANCIAL RESOURCES AND MAY NOT BE ABLE TO WITHSTAND CHANGES IN BUSINESS CONDITIONS, INCLUDING THE CURRENT ECONOMIC DOWNTURN.

REVENUES FROM INDIRECT SALES COULD SUFFER IF OUR DISTRIBUTORS FINANCIAL CONDITION OR OPERATIONS WEAKEN.



SERVICE PROVIDER CUSTOMERS MAY DEMAND RIGOROUS ACCEPTANCE TESTING OR PRIME CONTRACTING. AS WE DEVELOP MORE SOLUTION ORIENTED PRODUCTS, ENTERPRISE CUSTOMERS MAY DEMAND SIMILAR TERMS

AND CONDITIONS. SUCH TERMS AND CONDITIONS CAN LOWER GROSS MARGIN AND DEFER REVENUE RECOGNITION.

OUR INVENTORY MANAGEMENT RELATING TO OUR SALES TO DISTRIBUTORS IS COMPLEX, AND EXCESS FINISHED GOODS MAY HARM OUR GROSS MARGINS

WE MUST MANAGE OUR INVENTORY RELATING TO SALES TO OUR DISTRIBUTORS EFFECTIVELY. WITH RESPECT TO FINISHED GOODS, INVENTORY HELD BY OUR

TWO-TIER DISTRIBUTORS COULD AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. DISTRIBUTORS MAY INCREASE ORDERS DURING PERIODS OF PRODUCT SHORTAGES, CANCEL ORDERS IF THEIR INVENTORY IS TOO HIGH, OR DELAY ORDERS IN ANTICIPATION OF NEW PRODUCTS. DISTRIBUTORS ALSO MAY

ADJUST THEIR ORDERS IN RESPONSE TO THE SUPPLY OF OUR PRODUCTS AND THE PRODUCTS OF OUR COMPETITORS THAT ARE AVAILABLE TO THE DISTRIBUTOR AND IN RESPONSE TO SEASONAL FLUCTUATIONS IN END-USER DEMAND.

17

TABLE OF CONTENTS

IF WE HAVE EXCESS INVENTORY, WE MAY HAVE TO REDUCE OUR PRICES AND WRITE DOWN INVENTORY, WHICH IN TURN COULD RESULT IN

LOWER GROSS MARGINS. OUR TWO-TIER DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS, IN CONTRAST TO OUR ONE-TIER DISTRIBUTORS, ARE GIVEN BUSINESS TERMS THAT ALLOW THEM TO RETURN A PORTION OF INVENTORY AND PARTICIPATE IN VARIOUS COOPERATIVE MARKETING PROGRAMS. WE RECOGNIZE

REVENUE TO TWO-TIER DISTRIBUTORS BASED ON A SELL-THROUGH METHOD UTILIZING INFORMATION PROVIDED BY OUR DISTRIBUTORS, AND WE ALSO MAINTAIN ACCRUALS AND ALLOWANCES FOR ALL COOPERATIVE MARKETING AND OTHER PROGRAMS.

SALES TO THE SERVICE PROVIDER MARKET ARE ESPECIALLY VOLATILE, AND CONTINUED DECLINES OR

DELAYS IN SALES ORDERS FROM THIS INDUSTRY MAY HARM OUR OPERATING RESULTS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

SALES TO THE SERVICE PROVIDER MARKET HAVE BEEN CHARACTERIZED BY LARGE AND OFTEN SPORADIC PURCHASES WITH LONGER SALES CYCLES. ALTHOUGH WE CONTINUE TO INVEST IN DEVELOPMENT OF NEW PRODUCTS AIMED AT THIS MARKET SEGMENT,

WE HAVE EXPERIENCED SIGNIFICANT DECREASES IN SALES TO SERVICE PROVIDERS AS MARKET CONDITIONS HAVE CHANGED. SALES ACTIVITY IN THIS INDUSTRY DEPENDS UPON THE STAGE OF COMPLETION OF EXPANDING NETWORK INFRASTRUCTURES, THE AVAILABILITY OF FUNDING, AND

THE EXTENT THAT SERVICE PROVIDERS ARE AFFECTED BY REGULATORY, ECONOMIC AND BUSINESS CONDITIONS IN THE COUNTRY OF OPERATIONS. CONTINUED DECLINES OR DELAYS IN ORDERS FROM THIS INDUSTRY COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, OPERATING

RESULTS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. THE SLOWDOWN IN THE GENERAL ECONOMY, OVER-CAPACITY, CHANGES IN THE SERVICE PROVIDER MARKET, AND THE CONSTRAINTS ON CAPITAL AVAILABILITY HAVE HAD A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON MANY OF OUR SERVICE PROVIDER CUSTOMERS,

WITH NUMEROUS SUCH CUSTOMERS GOING OUT OF BUSINESS OR SUBSTANTIALLY REDUCING THEIR EXPANSION PLANS. THESE CONDITIONS HAVE HAD A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS AND OPERATING RESULTS, AND WE EXPECT THAT THESE CONDITIONS MAY CONTINUE FOR THE

FORESEEABLE FUTURE. FINALLY, SERVICE PROVIDER CUSTOMERS TYPICALLY HAVE LONGER IMPLEMENTATION CYCLES, REQUIRE A BROADER RANGE OF SERVICE INCLUDING DESIGN SERVICES, DEMAND THAT VENDORS TAKE ON A LARGER SHARE OF RISKS, OFTEN REQUIRE ACCEPTANCE

PROVISIONS WHICH CAN LEAD TO A DELAY IN REVENUE RECOGNITION, AND EXPECT FINANCING FROM VENDORS. ALL THESE FACTORS CAN ADD FURTHER RISK TO BUSINESS CONDUCTED WITH SERVICE PROVIDERS.

A SHORTAGE OF ADEQUATE COMPONENT SUPPLY OR MANUFACTURING CAPACITY COULD INCREASE OUR COSTS OR CAUSE A DELAY IN OUR ABILITY TO FULFILL

ORDERS, AND OUR FAILURE TO ESTIMATE CUSTOMER DEMAND PROPERLY MAY RESULT IN EXCESS OR OBSOLETE COMPONENT SUPPLY THAT COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR GROSS MARGINS

OUR GROWTH AND ABILITY TO MEET CUSTOMER DEMANDS DEPEND IN PART ON OUR ABILITY TO OBTAIN TIMELY DELIVERIES OF PARTS FROM OUR SUPPLIERS. WE

HAVE EXPERIENCED COMPONENT SHORTAGES IN THE PAST THAT HAVE ADVERSELY AFFECTED OUR OPERATIONS. WE MAY IN THE FUTURE EXPERIENCE A SHORTAGE OF CERTAIN COMPONENT PARTS AS A RESULT OF STRONG DEMAND IN THE INDUSTRY FOR THOSE PARTS OR PROBLEMS EXPERIENCED

BY SUPPLIERS. IF SHORTAGES OR DELAYS PERSIST, THE PRICE OF THESE COMPONENTS MAY INCREASE, OR THE COMPONENTS MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE AT ALL. WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO SECURE ENOUGH COMPONENTS AT REASONABLE PRICES OR OF ACCEPTABLE QUALITY TO BUILD NEW

PRODUCTS IN A TIMELY

18

TABLE OF CONTENTS

MANNER IN THE QUANTITIES OR CONFIGURATIONS NEEDED. ACCORDINGLY, OUR REVENUES AND GROSS MARGINS COULD SUFFER UNTIL OTHER

SOURCES CAN BE DEVELOPED. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL NOT ENCOUNTER THESE PROBLEMS IN THE FUTURE. ALTHOUGH IN MANY CASES WE USE STANDARD PARTS AND COMPONENTS FOR OUR PRODUCTS, CERTAIN COMPONENTS ARE PRESENTLY AVAILABLE ONLY FROM A SINGLE

SOURCE OR LIMITED SOURCES. WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO DIVERSIFY SOURCES IN A TIMELY MANNER, WHICH COULD HARM OUR ABILITY TO DELIVER PRODUCTS TO CUSTOMERS AND SERIOUSLY IMPACT PRESENT AND FUTURE SALES.

WE BELIEVE THAT WE MAY BE FACED WITH THE FOLLOWING CHALLENGES GOING FORWARD.



NEW MARKETS IN WHICH WE PARTICIPATE MAY GROW QUICKLY, AND THUS CONSUME SIGNIFICANT COMPONENT CAPACITY;



AS WE CONTINUE TO ACQUIRE COMPANIES AND NEW TECHNOLOGIES, WE ARE DEPENDENT, AT LEAST INITIALLY, ON UNFAMILIAR SUPPLY CHAINS OR RELATIVELY SMALL SUPPLY PARTNERS; AND



WE FACE COMPETITION FOR CERTAIN COMPONENTS, WHICH ARE SUPPLY CONSTRAINED, FROM EXISTING COMPETITORS AND COMPANIES IN OTHER MARKETS.

MANUFACTURING CAPACITY AND COMPONENT SUPPLY CONSTRAINTS COULD BE SIGNIFICANT ISSUES FOR US.

WE USE SEVERAL CONTRACT MANUFACTURERS AND SUPPLIERS TO PROVIDE MANUFACTURING SERVICES FOR OUR PRODUCTS. DURING THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS, IN ORDER TO REDUCE MANUFACTURING LEAD TIMES AND ENSURE ADEQUATE COMPONENT SUPPLY, WE ENTER INTO AGREEMENTS

WITH CERTAIN CONTRACT MANUFACTURERS AND SUPPLIERS THAT ALLOW THEM TO PROCURE INVENTORY BASED UPON CRITERIA AS DEFINED BY US. IF WE FAIL TO ANTICIPATE CUSTOMER DEMAND PROPERLY, AN OVERSUPPLY OF PARTS COULD RESULT IN EXCESS OR OBSOLETE COMPONENTS THAT

COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR GROSS MARGINS. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING OUR PURCHASE COMMITMENTS, SEE NOTE 8 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN OUR 2003 ANNUAL REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS. A REDUCTION OR INTERRUPTION IN SUPPLY, A

SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN THE PRICE OF ONE OR MORE COMPONENTS, A FAILURE TO ADEQUATELY AUTHORIZE PROCUREMENT OF INVENTORY BY OUR CONTRACT MANUFACTURERS, OR A DECREASE IN DEMAND OF PRODUCTS COULD MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, OPERATING

RESULTS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION AND COULD MATERIALLY DAMAGE CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIPS. FURTHERMORE, AS A RESULT OF BINDING PRICE OR PURCHASE COMMITMENTS WITH SUPPLIERS, WE MAY BE OBLIGATED TO PURCHASE COMPONENTS AT PRICES THAT ARE HIGHER THAN THOSE

AVAILABLE IN THE CURRENT MARKET. IN THE EVENT THAT WE BECOME COMMITTED TO PURCHASE COMPONENTS AT PRICES IN EXCESS OF THE CURRENT MARKET PRICE WHEN THE COMPONENTS ARE ACTUALLY UTILIZED, OUR GROSS MARGINS COULD DECREASE.

THE FACT THAT WE DO NOT OWN THE BULK OF OUR MANUFACTURING FACILITIES COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE

IMPACT ON THE SUPPLY OF OUR PRODUCTS AND ON OPERATING RESULTS. FINANCIAL PROBLEMS OF CONTRACT MANUFACTURERS ON WHOM WE RELY, OR RESERVATION OF MANUFACTURING CAPACITY BY OTHER COMPANIES, INSIDE OR OUTSIDE OF OUR INDUSTRY, COULD EITHER LIMIT SUPPLY OR

INCREASE COSTS.

THE MARKETS IN WHICH WE COMPETE ARE INTENSELY COMPETITIVE,

WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR REVENUE GROWTH

FOR INFORMATION REGARDING

OUR COMPETITION, AND THE RISKS ARISING OUT OF THE COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH WE OPERATE, SEE THE SECTION ENTITLED COMPETITION CONTAINED IN ITEM 1 OF THIS REPORT.

19

TABLE OF CONTENTS

WE DEPEND UPON THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW PRODUCTS AND ENHANCEMENTS TO EXISTING PRODUCTS, AND IF WE FAIL TO PREDICT AND

RESPOND TO EMERGING TECHNOLOGICAL TRENDS AND CUSTOMERS CHANGING NEEDS, OUR OPERATING RESULTS AND MARKET SHARE MAY SUFFER

THE MARKETS FOR OUR PRODUCTS ARE CHARACTERIZED BY RAPIDLY CHANGING TECHNOLOGY, EVOLVING INDUSTRY STANDARDS, NEW PRODUCT INTRODUCTIONS, AND EVOLVING METHODS OF BUILDING

AND OPERATING NETWORKS. OUR OPERATING RESULTS DEPEND ON OUR ABILITY TO DEVELOP AND INTRODUCE NEW PRODUCTS INTO EXISTING AND EMERGING MARKETS AND TO REDUCE THE PRODUCTION COSTS OF EXISTING PRODUCTS. WE BELIEVE THE INTERNET AND OTHER DATA, VOICE AND

VIDEO NETWORKS ARE EVOLVING INTO A NETWORK OF NETWORKS, WHICH WILL REQUIRE COMMON TECHNOLOGY PLATFORMS AND BROAD END-TO-END SOLUTIONS FOR PARTICULAR APPLICATIONS RATHER THAN PRODUCTS AIMED AT PARTICULAR MARKET SEGMENTS. IN THAT

ENVIRONMENT, CUSTOMERS WILL BE MORE CONCERNED WITH OVERALL SOLUTIONS RATHER THAN WITH WHETHER THE SOLUTION IS BUILT AROUND A PARTICULAR TECHNOLOGY, SUCH AS ROUTING OR SWITCHING. THE PROCESS OF DEVELOPING NEW TECHNOLOGY IS COMPLEX AND UNCERTAIN, AND

IF WE FAIL TO ACCURATELY PREDICT CUSTOMERS CHANGING NEEDS AND EMERGING TECHNOLOGICAL TRENDS, OUR BUSINESS COULD BE HARMED. WE MUST COMMIT SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES TO DEVELOP NEW PRODUCTS BEFORE KNOWING WHETHER OUR INVESTMENTS WILL RESULT IN

PRODUCTS THE MARKET WILL ACCEPT. IN PARTICULAR, IF THE NETWORK OF NETWORKS MODEL DOES NOT EMERGE AS WE BELIEVE IT WILL, MANY OF OUR INVESTMENTS MAY PROVE TO BE WITHOUT VALUE. FURTHERMORE, WE MAY NOT EXECUTE SUCCESSFULLY ON THAT VISION

BECAUSE OF ERRORS IN PRODUCT PLANNING OR TIMING, TECHNICAL HURDLES THAT WE FAIL TO OVERCOME IN A TIMELY FASHION, OR A LACK OF APPROPRIATE RESOURCES. THIS COULD RESULT IN COMPETITORS PROVIDING THOSE SOLUTIONS BEFORE WE DO, AND LOSS OF MARKET SHARE,

REVENUES AND EARNINGS. THE SUCCESS OF NEW PRODUCTS IS DEPENDENT ON SEVERAL FACTORS, INCLUDING PROPER NEW PRODUCT DEFINITION, COMPONENT COSTS, TIMELY COMPLETION AND INTRODUCTION OF THESE PRODUCTS, DIFFERENTIATION OF NEW PRODUCTS FROM THOSE OF OUR

COMPETITORS, AND MARKET ACCEPTANCE OF THESE PRODUCTS. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL SUCCESSFULLY IDENTIFY NEW PRODUCT OPPORTUNITIES, DEVELOP AND BRING NEW PRODUCTS TO MARKET IN A TIMELY MANNER, OR ACHIEVE MARKET ACCEPTANCE OF OUR PRODUCTS,

OR THAT PRODUCTS AND TECHNOLOGIES DEVELOPED BY OTHERS WILL NOT RENDER OUR PRODUCTS OR TECHNOLOGIES OBSOLETE OR NONCOMPETITIVE. SPECIFICALLY, THE PRODUCTS AND TECHNOLOGIES THAT WE HAVE IDENTIFIED AS ADVANCED TECHNOLOGIES MAY NOT PROVE TO

HAVE THE MARKET SUCCESS WE ANTICIPATE, AND WE MAY NOT SUCCESSFULLY IDENTIFY AND INVEST IN OTHER ADVANCED TECHNOLOGIES THAT WILL BE IMPORTANT FOR OUR FUTURE SUCCESS.

OUR BUSINESS SUBSTANTIALLY DEPENDS UPON THE CONTINUED GROWTH OF THE INTERNET AND INTERNET-BASED SYSTEMS; CHANGES IN INDUSTRY STRUCTURE

AND MARKET CONDITIONS COULD LEAD TO DISCONTINUANCES OF CERTAIN OF OUR PRODUCTS OR BUSINESSES

A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF OUR BUSINESS AND REVENUE DEPENDS ON GROWTH OF THE INTERNET AND ON THE DEPLOYMENT OF OUR PRODUCTS BY CUSTOMERS THAT DEPEND ON THE CONTINUED GROWTH OF THE INTERNET. AS A RESULT OF THE CURRENT

ECONOMIC SLOWDOWN AND REDUCTION IN CAPITAL SPENDING, WHICH HAVE PARTICULARLY AFFECTED TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICE PROVIDERS, SPENDING ON INTERNET INFRASTRUCTURE HAS DECLINED, WHICH HAS HAD A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS. TO THE EXTENT THAT

THE ECONOMIC SLOWDOWN AND REDUCTION IN CAPITAL SPENDING CONTINUE TO ADVERSELY AFFECT SPENDING ON

20

TABLE OF CONTENTS

INTERNET INFRASTRUCTURE, WE COULD CONTINUE TO EXPERIENCE MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECTS ON OUR BUSINESS, OPERATING RESULTS, AND

FINANCIAL CONDITION.

BECAUSE OF THE RAPID INTRODUCTION OF NEW PRODUCTS, AND

CHANGING CUSTOMER REQUIREMENTS RELATED TO MATTERS SUCH AS COST-EFFECTIVENESS AND SECURITY, WE BELIEVE THAT THERE COULD BE CERTAIN PERFORMANCE PROBLEMS WITH INTERNET COMMUNICATIONS IN THE FUTURE, WHICH COULD RECEIVE A HIGH DEGREE OF PUBLICITY AND

VISIBILITY. AS WE ARE A LARGE SUPPLIER OF NETWORKING PRODUCTS, OUR BUSINESS, OPERATING RESULTS, AND FINANCIAL CONDITION MAY BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER OR NOT THESE PROBLEMS ARE DUE TO THE PERFORMANCE OF OUR OWN PRODUCTS.

SUCH AN EVENT COULD ALSO RESULT IN A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE MARKET PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK INDEPENDENT OF DIRECT EFFECTS ON OUR BUSINESS.

IN RESPONSE TO CHANGES IN INDUSTRY AND MARKET CONDITIONS, WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO STRATEGICALLY REALIGN OUR RESOURCES AND CONSIDER RESTRUCTURING, DISPOSING OF, OR OTHERWISE

EXITING BUSINESSES. ANY DECISION TO LIMIT INVESTMENT IN OR DISPOSE OF OR OTHERWISE EXIT BUSINESSES MAY RESULT IN THE RECORDING OF SPECIAL CHARGES, SUCH AS INVENTORY AND TECHNOLOGY RELATED WRITE-OFFS, WORKFORCE REDUCTION COSTS, CHARGES RELATING TO

CONSOLIDATION OF EXCESS FACILITIES, OR CLAIMS FROM THIRD PARTIES WHO WERE RESELLERS OR USERS OF DISCONTINUED PRODUCTS. OUR ESTIMATES WITH RESPECT TO THE USEFUL LIFE OR ULTIMATE RECOVERABILITY OF OUR CARRYING BASIS OF ASSETS, INCLUDING PURCHASED

INTANGIBLE ASSETS, COULD CHANGE AS A RESULT OF SUCH ASSESSMENTS AND DECISIONS. FURTHER, OUR ESTIMATES RELATING TO THE LIABILITIES FOR EXCESS FACILITIES ARE AFFECTED BY CHANGES IN REAL ESTATE MARKET CONDITIONS. ADDITIONALLY, WE ARE REQUIRED TO

PERFORM GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT TESTS ON AN ANNUAL BASIS AND BETWEEN ANNUAL TESTS IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT FUTURE GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT TESTS WILL NOT RESULT IN A CHARGE TO EARNINGS.

WE HAVE MADE AND EXPECT TO CONTINUE TO MAKE ACQUISITIONS THAT COULD DISRUPT OUR OPERATIONS

AND HARM OUR OPERATING RESULTS

OUR GROWTH IS DEPENDENT UPON MARKET

GROWTH, OUR ABILITY TO ENHANCE OUR EXISTING PRODUCTS, AND OUR ABILITY TO INTRODUCE NEW PRODUCTS ON A TIMELY BASIS. WE INTEND TO CONTINUE TO ADDRESS THE NEED TO DEVELOP NEW PRODUCTS AND ENHANCE EXISTING PRODUCTS THROUGH ACQUISITIONS OF OTHER

COMPANIES, PRODUCT LINES, TECHNOLOGIES AND PERSONNEL. ACQUISITIONS INVOLVE NUMEROUS RISKS, INCLUDING THE FOLLOWING.



DIFFICULTIES IN INTEGRATING THE OPERATIONS, TECHNOLOGIES, PRODUCTS AND PERSONNEL OF THE ACQUIRED COMPANIES;



DIVERSION OF MANAGEMENTS ATTENTION FROM NORMAL DAILY OPERATIONS OF THE BUSINESS;



POTENTIAL DIFFICULTIES IN COMPLETING PROJECTS ASSOCIATED WITH IN-PROCESS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT;



DIFFICULTIES IN ENTERING MARKETS IN WHICH WE HAVE NO OR LIMITED DIRECT PRIOR EXPERIENCE AND WHERE COMPETITORS IN SUCH MARKETS HAVE STRONGER MARKET POSITIONS;



INITIAL DEPENDENCE ON UNFAMILIAR SUPPLY CHAINS OR RELATIVELY SMALL SUPPLY PARTNERS;



INSUFFICIENT REVENUES TO OFFSET INCREASED EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH ACQUISITIONS; AND



THE POTENTIAL LOSS OF KEY EMPLOYEES OF THE ACQUIRED COMPANIES.

21

TABLE OF CONTENTS

ACQUISITIONS MAY ALSO CAUSE US TO.



ISSUE COMMON STOCK THAT WOULD DILUTE OUR CURRENT SHAREHOLDERS PERCENTAGE OWNERSHIP;



ASSUME LIABILITIES;



RECORD GOODWILL AND NON-AMORTIZABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS THAT WILL BE SUBJECT TO IMPAIRMENT TESTING ON A REGULAR BASIS AND POTENTIAL PERIODIC IMPAIRMENT CHARGES;



INCUR AMORTIZATION EXPENSES RELATED TO CERTAIN INTANGIBLE ASSETS;



INCUR LARGE AND IMMEDIATE WRITE-OFFS, AND RESTRUCTURING AND OTHER RELATED EXPENSES; OR



BECOME SUBJECT TO LITIGATION.

MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS OF HIGH-TECHNOLOGY COMPANIES ARE INHERENTLY RISKY, AND NO ASSURANCE CAN BE GIVEN THAT OUR PREVIOUS OR FUTURE ACQUISITIONS WILL BE SUCCESSFUL AND

WILL NOT MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, OPERATING RESULTS OR FINANCIAL CONDITION. FAILURE TO MANAGE AND SUCCESSFULLY INTEGRATE ACQUISITIONS WE MAKE COULD HARM OUR BUSINESS AND OPERATING RESULTS IN A MATERIAL WAY. PRIOR ACQUISITIONS HAVE

RESULTED IN A WIDE RANGE OF OUTCOMES, FROM SUCCESSFUL INTRODUCTION OF NEW PRODUCTS AND TECHNOLOGIES TO AN INABILITY TO DO SO. EVEN WHEN AN ACQUIRED COMPANY HAS ALREADY DEVELOPED AND MARKETED PRODUCTS, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT PRODUCT

ENHANCEMENTS WILL BE MADE IN A TIMELY FASHION OR THAT PREACQUISITION DUE DILIGENCE WILL HAVE IDENTIFIED ALL POSSIBLE ISSUES THAT MIGHT ARISE WITH RESPECT TO SUCH PRODUCTS.

FROM TIME TO TIME, WE HAVE MADE ACQUISITIONS THAT RESULT IN IN-PROCESS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES BEING CHARGED IN AN INDIVIDUAL

QUARTER. THESE CHARGES MAY OCCUR IN ANY PARTICULAR QUARTER, RESULTING IN VARIABILITY IN OUR QUARTERLY EARNINGS.

SEE ALSO THE DISCUSSION OF RISKS RELATED TO NEW PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT, WHICH ALSO APPLIES TO ACQUISITIONS, ABOVE UNDER THE RISK FACTOR ENTITLED, WE DEPEND UPON THE

DEVELOPMENT OF NEW PRODUCTS AND ENHANCEMENTS TO EXISTING PRODUCTS, AND IF WE FAIL TO PREDICT AND RESPOND TO EMERGING TECHNOLOGICAL TRENDS AND CUSTOMERS CHANGING NEEDS, OUR OPERATING RESULTS AND MARKET SHARE MAY SUFFER.

ENTRANCE INTO NEW OR DEVELOPING MARKETS EXPOSES US TO ADDITIONAL COMPETITION AND WILL

LIKELY INCREASE DEMANDS ON OUR SERVICE AND SUPPORT OPERATIONS

AS WE FOCUS

ON NEW MARKET OPPORTUNITIES, SUCH AS STORAGE, WIRELESS, SECURITY, TRANSPORTING DATA, VOICE, AND VIDEO TRAFFIC ACROSS THE SAME NETWORK, WE WILL INCREASINGLY COMPETE WITH LARGE TELECOMMUNICATIONS EQUIPMENT SUPPLIERS AS WELL AS STARTUP COMPANIES.

SEVERAL OF OUR COMPETITORS MAY HAVE GREATER RESOURCES, INCLUDING TECHNICAL AND ENGINEERING RESOURCES, THAN WE DO. ADDITIONALLY, AS CUSTOMERS IN THESE MARKETS COMPLETE INFRASTRUCTURE DEPLOYMENTS, THEY MAY REQUIRE GREATER LEVELS OF SERVICE, SUPPORT

AND FINANCING THAN WE HAVE PROVIDED IN THE PAST. DEMAND FOR THESE TYPES OF SERVICE OR FINANCING CONTRACTS MAY INCREASE IN THE FUTURE. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT WE CAN PROVIDE PRODUCTS, SERVICE, SUPPORT AND FINANCING TO EFFECTIVELY COMPETE FOR

THESE MARKET OPPORTUNITIES. FURTHER, PROVISION OF GREATER LEVELS OF SERVICES BY US MAY RESULT IN A DELAY IN THE TIMING OF REVENUE RECOGNITION. IN ADDITION, IF WE SUCCESSFULLY MOVE INTO OTHER

22

TABLE OF CONTENTS

MARKETS, SUCH AS THE CONSUMER MARKET, WE WILL BE SUBJECT TO ADDITIONAL RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THAT MARKET, INCLUDING THE

EFFECTS OF GENERAL MARKET CONDITIONS AND REDUCED CONSUMER CONFIDENCE.

PRODUCT QUALITY PROBLEMS COULD LEAD TO REDUCED REVENUES, GROSS MARGINS AND NET INCOME

WE PRODUCE HIGHLY COMPLEX PRODUCTS THAT INCORPORATE LEADING-EDGE TECHNOLOGY, INCLUDING BOTH HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE. SOFTWARE TYPICALLY CONTAINS BUGS THAT CAN UNEXPECTEDLY INTERFERE WITH EXPECTED OPERATIONS. THERE CAN

BE NO ASSURANCE THAT OUR PRE-SHIPMENT TESTING PROGRAMS WILL BE ADEQUATE TO DETECT ALL DEFECTSEITHER IN INDIVIDUAL PRODUCTS OR WHICH COULD AFFECT NUMEROUS SHIPMENTSWHICH MIGHT INTERFERE WITH CUSTOMER SATISFACTION, REDUCE SALES

OPPORTUNITIES, OR AFFECT GROSS MARGINS. IN THE PAST, WE HAVE HAD TO RECALL CERTAIN COMPONENTS AND PROVIDE REMEDIATION IN RESPONSE TO THE DISCOVERY OF BUGS IN PRODUCTS THAT WE HAD SHIPPED. WHILE THE COST OF SUCH RECALLS AND REMEDIATION HAS NOT BEEN

MATERIAL IN THE PAST, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT SUCH A RECALL OR REMEDIATION, DEPENDING ON THE PRODUCT INVOLVED, WOULD NOT HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT. AN INABILITY TO CURE A PRODUCT DEFECT COULD RESULT IN THE FAILURE OF A PRODUCT LINE, TEMPORARY OR

PERMANENT WITHDRAWAL FROM A PRODUCT OR MARKET SEGMENT, DAMAGE TO OUR REPUTATION, INVENTORY COSTS, OR PRODUCT REENGINEERING EXPENSES, ANY OF WHICH COULD HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON REVENUES, MARGINS AND NET INCOME.

INDUSTRY CONSOLIDATION MAY LEAD TO INCREASED COMPETITION AND MAY HARM OUR OPERATING

RESULTS

THERE HAS BEEN A TREND TOWARD INDUSTRY CONSOLIDATION IN OUR

MARKETS FOR SEVERAL YEARS. WE EXPECT THIS TREND TOWARD INDUSTRY CONSOLIDATION TO CONTINUE AS COMPANIES ATTEMPT TO STRENGTHEN OR HOLD THEIR MARKET POSITIONS IN AN EVOLVING INDUSTRY AND AS COMPANIES ARE ACQUIRED OR ARE UNABLE TO CONTINUE OPERATIONS.

WE BELIEVE THAT INDUSTRY CONSOLIDATION MAY RESULT IN STRONGER COMPETITORS THAT ARE BETTER ABLE TO COMPETE AS SOLE-SOURCE VENDORS FOR CUSTOMERS. THIS COULD LEAD TO MORE VARIABILITY IN OPERATING RESULTS AND COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR

BUSINESS, OPERATING RESULTS, AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. FURTHERMORE, PARTICULARLY IN THE SERVICE PROVIDER MARKET, RAPID CONSOLIDATION WILL LEAD TO FEWER CUSTOMERS, WITH THE EFFECT THAT LOSS OF A MAJOR CUSTOMER COULD HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON RESULTS

NOT ANTICIPATED IN A CUSTOMER MARKETPLACE COMPOSED OF MORE NUMEROUS PARTICIPANTS.

DUE TO THE GLOBAL NATURE OF OUR OPERATIONS, POLITICAL OR ECONOMIC CHANGES, OR OTHER FACTORS, IN A SPECIFIC COUNTRY OR REGION COULD HARM OUR COSTS, EXPENSES AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

WE CONDUCT SIGNIFICANT SALES AND CUSTOMER SUPPORT OPERATIONS IN COUNTRIES OUTSIDE OF THE

UNITED STATES AND ALSO DEPEND ON NON-U.S. OPERATIONS OF OUR CONTRACT MANUFACTURERS AND OUR DISTRIBUTION PARTNERS. FOR FISCAL 2003, WE DERIVED 48.9% OF OUR REVENUES FROM SALES OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES. ACCORDINGLY, OUR FUTURE RESULTS COULD BE

MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY A VARIETY OF UNCONTROLLABLE AND CHANGING FACTORS INCLUDING, AMONG OTHERS, FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES; POLITICAL OR SOCIAL UNREST OR ECONOMIC INSTABILITY IN A SPECIFIC COUNTRY OR REGION; TRADE PROTECTION MEASURES

AND OTHER REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS WHICH MAY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO IMPORT OR EXPORT OUR

PRODUCTS FROM VARIOUS COUNTRIES; POLITICAL CONSIDERATIONS THAT AFFECT SERVICE PROVIDER AND GOVERNMENT SPENDING PATTERNS;

DIFFICULTIES IN STAFFING AND MANAGING INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS; AND ADVERSE TAX CONSEQUENCES, INCLUDING IMPOSITION OF WITHHOLDING OR OTHER TAXES ON PAYMENTS BY SUBSIDIARIES. IN ADDITION, IF THE OUTBREAK OF SEVERE ACUTE RESPIRATORY SYNDROME (SARS) IN

ASIA CONTINUES OR RECURS, THIS COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR ASIAN OPERATIONS. IF THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT SPREAD OF SARS BEYOND ASIA, OTHER ASPECTS OF OUR OPERATIONS COULD BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED. ANY OR ALL OF THESE FACTORS COULD HAVE A

MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR COSTS, EXPENSES AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

WE

ARE EXPOSED TO FLUCTUATIONS IN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES THAT COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS AND CASH FLOWS

BECAUSE A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR BUSINESS IS CONDUCTED OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES, WE FACE EXPOSURE TO ADVERSE MOVEMENTS IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES. THESE

EXPOSURES MAY CHANGE OVER TIME AS BUSINESS PRACTICES EVOLVE AND COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS AND CASH FLOWS. HISTORICALLY, OUR PRIMARY EXPOSURES HAVE RELATED TO NON-DOLLAR-DENOMINATED SALES IN JAPAN, CANADA, AND

AUSTRALIA, AND CERTAIN NON-DOLLAR-DENOMINATED OPERATING EXPENSES IN EUROPE, LATIN AMERICA, AND ASIA, WHERE WE SELL PRIMARILY IN U.S. DOLLARS. ADDITIONALLY, WE HAVE EXPOSURES TO EMERGING MARKET CURRENCIES, WHICH CAN HAVE EXTREME CURRENCY VOLATILITY.

AN INCREASE IN THE VALUE OF THE DOLLAR COULD INCREASE THE REAL COST TO OUR CUSTOMERS OF OUR PRODUCTS IN THOSE MARKETS OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES WHERE WE SELL IN DOLLARS, AND A WEAKENED DOLLAR COULD INCREASE THE COST OF LOCAL OPERATING EXPENSES AND

PROCUREMENT OF RAW MATERIALS TO THE EXTENT WE MUST PURCHASE COMPONENTS IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES.

CURRENTLY, WE ENTER INTO FOREIGN EXCHANGE FORWARD CONTRACTS TO MINIMIZE THE SHORT-TERM IMPACT OF FOREIGN CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS ON CERTAIN FOREIGN CURRENCY RECEIVABLES, INVESTMENTS AND PAYABLES. IN ADDITION, WE

PERIODICALLY WILL HEDGE ANTICIPATED FOREIGN CURRENCY CASH FLOWS. OUR ATTEMPTS TO HEDGE AGAINST THESE RISKS MAY NOT BE SUCCESSFUL, RESULTING IN AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR NET INCOME.

WE ARE EXPOSED TO THE CREDIT RISK OF SOME OF OUR CUSTOMERS AND TO CREDIT EXPOSURES IN WEAKENED MARKETS, WHICH COULD RESULT IN MATERIAL

LOSSES

MOST OF OUR SALES ARE ON AN OPEN CREDIT BASIS, WITH TYPICAL

PAYMENT TERMS OF 30 DAYS IN THE UNITED STATES, AND, BECAUSE OF LOCAL CUSTOMS OR CONDITIONS, LONGER IN SOME MARKETS OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES. WE MONITOR INDIVIDUAL CUSTOMER PAYMENT CAPABILITY IN GRANTING SUCH OPEN CREDIT ARRANGEMENTS, SEEK TO LIMIT

SUCH OPEN CREDIT TO AMOUNTS WE BELIEVE THE CUSTOMERS CAN PAY, AND MAINTAIN RESERVES WE BELIEVE ARE ADEQUATE TO COVER EXPOSURE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS. BEYOND OUR OPEN CREDIT ARRANGEMENTS, WE HAVE ALSO EXPERIENCED DEMANDS FOR CUSTOMER FINANCING AND

FACILITATION OF LEASING ARRANGEMENTS. WE EXPECT DEMAND FOR CUSTOMER FINANCING TO CONTINUE. WE BELIEVE CUSTOMER FINANCING IS A COMPETITIVE FACTOR IN OBTAINING BUSINESS, PARTICULARLY IN SUPPLYING CUSTOMERS INVOLVED IN SIGNIFICANT INFRASTRUCTURE

PROJECTS. OUR LOAN FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS MAY INCLUDE NOT ONLY FINANCING THE ACQUISITION OF OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES BUT ALSO PROVIDING ADDITIONAL FUNDS FOR OTHER COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH NETWORK INSTALLATION AND

24

TABLE OF CONTENTS

INTEGRATION OF OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES AND FOR WORKING CAPITAL PURPOSES. WE DO NOT RECOGNIZE REVENUE ON SUCH LOAN

FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS UNTIL CASH PAYMENTS ARE RECEIVED.

BECAUSE OF THE

CURRENT SLOWDOWN IN THE GLOBAL ECONOMY, OUR EXPOSURE TO THE CREDIT RISKS RELATING TO OUR FINANCING ACTIVITIES DESCRIBED ABOVE HAS INCREASED. ALTHOUGH WE HAVE PROGRAMS IN PLACE THAT ARE DESIGNED TO MONITOR AND MITIGATE THE ASSOCIATED RISK, INCLUDING

MONITORING OF PARTICULAR RISKS IN CERTAIN GEOGRAPHIC AREAS, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT SUCH PROGRAMS WILL BE EFFECTIVE IN REDUCING OUR CREDIT RISKS. THERE HAVE BEEN SIGNIFICANT BANKRUPTCIES AMONG CUSTOMERS BOTH ON OPEN CREDIT AND WITH LOAN OR

LEASE FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS, PARTICULARLY AMONG INTERNET BUSINESSES AND SERVICE PROVIDERS, CAUSING US TO INCUR ECONOMIC OR FINANCIAL LOSSES. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT ADDITIONAL LOSSES WILL NOT BE INCURRED. ALTHOUGH THESE LOSSES HAVE NOT BEEN

MATERIAL TO DATE, FUTURE LOSSES, IF INCURRED, COULD HARM OUR BUSINESS AND HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR OPERATING RESULTS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

A PORTION OF OUR SALES IS DERIVED THROUGH OUR RESELLERS IN TWO-TIER DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS. THESE RESELLERS/CUSTOMERS ARE GENERALLY GIVEN BUSINESS TERMS THAT ALLOW THEM TO

RETURN A PORTION OF INVENTORY, RECEIVE CREDITS FOR CHANGES IN SELLING PRICES, AND PARTICIPATE IN VARIOUS COOPERATIVE MARKETING PROGRAMS. WE MAINTAIN ESTIMATED ACCRUALS AND ALLOWANCES FOR SUCH EXPOSURES. HOWEVER, SUCH RESELLERS TEND TO HAVE MORE

LIMITED FINANCIAL RESOURCES THAN OTHER RESELLERS AND END-USER CUSTOMERS AND THEREFORE REPRESENT POTENTIAL SOURCES OF INCREASED CREDIT RISK BECAUSE THEY MAY BE MORE LIKELY TO LACK THE RESERVE RESOURCES TO MEET PAYMENT OBLIGATIONS.

OUR PROPRIETARY RIGHTS MAY PROVE DIFFICULT TO ENFORCE

WE GENERALLY RELY ON PATENTS, COPYRIGHTS, TRADEMARKS, AND TRADE SECRET LAWS TO ESTABLISH AND

MAINTAIN PROPRIETARY RIGHTS IN OUR TECHNOLOGY AND PRODUCTS. WHILE WE HAVE BEEN ISSUED A NUMBER OF PATENTS AND OTHER PATENT APPLICATIONS ARE CURRENTLY PENDING, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT ANY OF THESE PATENTS WILL NOT BE CHALLENGED, INVALIDATED,

OR CIRCUMVENTED, OR THAT ANY RIGHTS GRANTED UNDER THESE PATENTS WILL IN FACT PROVIDE COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGES TO US. FURTHERMORE, MANY KEY ASPECTS OF NETWORKING TECHNOLOGY ARE GOVERNED BY INDUSTRY-WIDE STANDARDS, WHICH ARE USABLE BY ALL MARKET

ENTRANTS. IN ADDITION, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT PATENTS WILL BE ISSUED FROM PENDING APPLICATIONS, OR THAT CLAIMS ALLOWED ON ANY PATENTS WILL BE SUFFICIENTLY BROAD TO PROTECT OUR TECHNOLOGY. IN ADDITION, THE LAWS OF SOME FOREIGN COUNTRIES MAY

NOT PROTECT OUR PROPRIETARY RIGHTS TO THE SAME EXTENT AS DO THE LAWS OF THE UNITED STATES. THE OUTCOME OF ANY ACTIONS TAKEN IN THESE FOREIGN COUNTRIES MAY BE DIFFERENT THAN IF SUCH ACTIONS WERE DETERMINED UNDER THE LAWS OF THE UNITED STATES. WHILE

WE ARE NOT DEPENDENT ON ANY INDIVIDUAL PATENTS OR GROUP OF PATENTS FOR PARTICULAR SEGMENTS OF THE BUSINESS FOR WHICH WE COMPETE, IF WE ARE UNABLE TO PROTECT OUR PROPRIETARY RIGHTS TO THE TOTALITY OF THE FEATURES (INCLUDING ASPECTS OF PRODUCTS

PROTECTED OTHER THAN BY PATENT RIGHTS) IN A MARKET, WE MAY FIND OURSELVES AT A COMPETITIVE DISADVANTAGE TO OTHERS WHO NEED NOT INCUR THE SUBSTANTIAL EXPENSE, TIME AND EFFORT REQUIRED TO CREATE THE INNOVATIVE PRODUCTS WHICH HAVE ENABLED US TO BE

SUCCESSFUL.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

WE MAY BE FOUND TO INFRINGE ON INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS OF OTHERS

THIRD PARTIES, INCLUDING CUSTOMERS, HAVE IN THE PAST AND MAY IN THE FUTURE ASSERT CLAIMS OR

INITIATE LITIGATION RELATED TO EXCLUSIVE PATENT, COPYRIGHT, TRADEMARK AND OTHER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS TO TECHNOLOGIES AND RELATED STANDARDS THAT ARE RELEVANT TO US. THESE ASSERTIONS HAVE INCREASED OVER TIME AS A RESULT OF OUR GROWTH AND THE

GENERAL INCREASE IN THE PACE OF PATENT CLAIMS ASSERTIONS, PARTICULARLY IN THE UNITED STATES. BECAUSE OF THE EXISTENCE OF A LARGE NUMBER OF PATENTS IN THE NETWORKING FIELD, THE SECRECY OF SOME PENDING PATENTS AND THE RAPID RATE OF ISSUANCE OF NEW

PATENTS, IT IS NOT ECONOMICALLY PRACTICAL NOR EVEN POSSIBLE TO DETERMINE IN ADVANCE WHETHER A PRODUCT OR ANY OF ITS COMPONENTS INFRINGE OR WILL INFRINGE THE PATENT RIGHTS OF OTHERS. THE ASSERTED CLAIMS AND/OR INITIATED LITIGATION, CAN INCLUDE CLAIMS

AGAINST US OR OUR MANUFACTURERS, SUPPLIERS, OR CUSTOMERS, ALLEGING INFRINGEMENT OF THEIR PROPRIETARY RIGHTS WITH RESPECT TO OUR EXISTING OR FUTURE PRODUCTS OR COMPONENTS OF THOSE PRODUCTS. REGARDLESS OF THE MERIT OF THESE CLAIMS, THEY CAN BE

TIME-CONSUMING, RESULT IN COSTLY LITIGATION AND DIVERSION OF TECHNICAL AND MANAGEMENT PERSONNEL, OR REQUIRE US TO DEVELOP A NON-INFRINGING TECHNOLOGY OR ENTER INTO LICENSE AGREEMENTS. WHERE CLAIMS ARE MADE BY CUSTOMERS, RESISTANCE EVEN TO

UNMERITORIOUS CLAIMS COULD DAMAGE CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIPS. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT LICENSES WILL BE AVAILABLE ON ACCEPTABLE TERMS AND CONDITIONS, IF AT ALL, IN ALL SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES, OR THAT OUR INDEMNIFICATION BY THEIR SUPPLIERS WILL BE

ADEQUATE TO COVER THEIR COSTS IF A CLAIM WERE BROUGHT DIRECTLY AGAINST US OR OUR CUSTOMERS. FURTHERMORE, BECAUSE OF THE POTENTIAL FOR HIGH COURT AWARDS WHICH ARE NOT NECESSARILY PREDICTABLE, IT IS NOT UNUSUAL TO FIND EVEN ARGUABLY UNMERITORIOUS

CLAIMS SETTLED FOR SIGNIFICANT FUNDS. IF ANY INFRINGEMENT OR OTHER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY CLAIM MADE AGAINST US BY ANY THIRD PARTY IS SUCCESSFUL, OR IF WE FAIL TO DEVELOP NON-INFRINGING TECHNOLOGY OR LICENSE THE PROPRIETARY RIGHTS ON COMMERCIALLY

REASONABLE TERMS AND CONDITIONS, OUR BUSINESS, OPERATING RESULTS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION COULD BE MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

OUR EXPOSURE TO RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE USE OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY MAY BE INCREASED AS A RESULT OF ACQUISITIONS, AS WE HAVE A LOWER LEVEL OF VISIBILITY INTO THE

DEVELOPMENT PROCESS WITH RESPECT TO SUCH TECHNOLOGY OR THE CARE TAKEN TO SAFEGUARD AGAINST INFRINGEMENT RISKS. FURTHER, IN THE PAST THIRD PARTIES HAVE MADE INFRINGEMENT AND SIMILAR CLAIMS AFTER WE HAVE ACQUIRED TECHNOLOGY THAT HAD NOT BEEN ASSERTED

PRIOR TO OUR ACQUISITION.

WE RELY ON THE AVAILABILITY OF THIRD-PARTY

LICENSES

MANY OF OUR PRODUCTS ARE DESIGNED TO INCLUDE SOFTWARE OR OTHER

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY LICENSED FROM THIRD PARTIES. IT MAY BE NECESSARY IN THE FUTURE TO SEEK OR RENEW LICENSES RELATING TO VARIOUS ASPECTS OF THESE PRODUCTS. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THE NECESSARY LICENSES WOULD BE AVAILABLE ON ACCEPTABLE

TERMS, IF AT ALL. THE INABILITY TO OBTAIN CERTAIN LICENSES OR OTHER RIGHTS OR TO OBTAIN SUCH LICENSES OR RIGHTS ON FAVORABLE TERMS, OR THE NEED TO ENGAGE IN LITIGATION REGARDING THESE MATTERS, COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS,

OPERATING RESULTS, AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. MOREOVER, THE INCLUSION IN OUR PRODUCTS OF SOFTWARE OR OTHER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY LICENSED FROM THIRD PARTIES ON A NON-EXCLUSIVE BASIS COULD LIMIT OUR ABILITY TO PROTECT OUR PROPRIETARY RIGHTS IN OUR

PRODUCTS.

OUR OPERATING RESULTS AND FUTURE PROSPECTS COULD BE MATERIALLY HARMED BY UNCERTAINTIES OF REGULATION OF THE INTERNET

CURRENTLY, FEW LAWS OR REGULATIONS APPLY DIRECTLY TO ACCESS OR COMMERCE

ON THE INTERNET. WE COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY REGULATION OF THE INTERNET AND INTERNET COMMERCE IN ANY COUNTRY WHERE WE OPERATE. SUCH REGULATIONS COULD INCLUDE MATTERS SUCH AS VOICE OVER THE INTERNET OR USING INTERNET PROTOCOL,

ENCRYPTION TECHNOLOGY, AND ACCESS CHARGES FOR INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDERS. THE ADOPTION OF REGULATION OF THE INTERNET AND INTERNET COMMERCE COULD DECREASE DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS, AND AT THE SAME TIME, INCREASE THE COST OF SELLING OUR PRODUCTS, WHICH

COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, OPERATING RESULTS, AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

OUR SUCCESS LARGELY DEPENDS ON OUR ABILITY TO RETAIN AND RECRUIT KEY PERSONNEL, AND ANY FAILURE TO DO SO WOULD HARM OUR ABILITY TO MEET KEY OBJECTIVES

OUR SUCCESS HAS ALWAYS DEPENDED IN LARGE PART ON OUR ABILITY TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN HIGHLY

SKILLED TECHNICAL, MANAGERIAL, SALES AND MARKETING PERSONNEL. IN SPITE OF THE ECONOMIC SLOWDOWN, COMPETITION FOR THESE PERSONNEL IS INTENSE, ESPECIALLY IN THE SILICON VALLEY AREA OF NORTHERN CALIFORNIA. VOLATILITY OR LACK OF POSITIVE PERFORMANCE IN

OUR STOCK PRICE MAY ALSO ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO RETAIN KEY EMPLOYEES, ALL OF WHOM HAVE BEEN GRANTED STOCK OPTIONS. THE LOSS OF SERVICES OF ANY OF OUR KEY PERSONNEL, THE INABILITY TO RETAIN AND ATTRACT QUALIFIED PERSONNEL IN THE FUTURE, OR

DELAYS IN HIRING REQUIRED PERSONNEL, PARTICULARLY ENGINEERING AND SALES PERSONNEL, COULD MAKE IT DIFFICULT TO MEET KEY OBJECTIVES, SUCH AS TIMELY AND EFFECTIVE PRODUCT INTRODUCTIONS. IN ADDITION, COMPANIES IN THE NETWORKING INDUSTRY WHOSE EMPLOYEES

ACCEPT POSITIONS WITH COMPETITORS FREQUENTLY CLAIM THAT COMPETITORS HAVE ENGAGED IN IMPROPER HIRING PRACTICES. WE HAVE RECEIVED THESE CLAIMS IN THE PAST AND MAY RECEIVE ADDITIONAL CLAIMS TO THIS EFFECT IN THE FUTURE.

ADVERSE RESOLUTION OF LITIGATION MAY HARM OUR OPERATING RESULTS OR FINANCIAL CONDITION

WE ARE A PARTY TO LAWSUITS IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF OUR BUSINESS.

LITIGATION CAN BE EXPENSIVE, LENGTHY AND DISRUPTIVE TO NORMAL BUSINESS OPERATIONS. MOREOVER, THE RESULTS OF COMPLEX LEGAL PROCEEDINGS ARE DIFFICULT TO PREDICT. AN UNFAVORABLE RESOLUTION OF A PARTICULAR LAWSUIT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON

OUR BUSINESS, OPERATING RESULTS, OR FINANCIAL CONDITION. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING CERTAIN OF THE LAWSUITS IN WHICH WE ARE INVOLVED, SEE ITEM 3, LEGAL PROCEEDINGS, CONTAINED IN PART I OF THIS REPORT.

CHANGES IN EFFECTIVE TAX RATES OR ADVERSE OUTCOMES RESULTING FROM EXAMINATION OF OUR

INCOME TAX RETURNS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS

OUR FUTURE

EFFECTIVE TAX RATES COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY EARNINGS BEING LOWER THAN ANTICIPATED IN COUNTRIES WHERE WE HAVE LOWER STATUTORY RATES, BY CHANGES IN THE VALUATION OF OUR

27

TABLE OF CONTENTS

DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, OR BY CHANGES IN TAX LAWS OR INTERPRETATIONS THEREOF. IN ADDITION, WE ARE SUBJECT TO

THE CONTINUOUS EXAMINATION OF OUR INCOME TAX RETURNS BY THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE AND OTHER TAX AUTHORITIES. WE REGULARLY ASSESS THE LIKELIHOOD OF ADVERSE OUTCOMES RESULTING FROM THESE EXAMINATIONS TO DETERMINE THE ADEQUACY OF OUR PROVISION FOR

INCOME TAXES. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THE OUTCOMES FROM THESE CONTINUOUS EXAMINATIONS WILL NOT HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR OPERATING RESULTS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

OUR BUSINESS AND OPERATIONS ARE ESPECIALLY SUBJECT TO THE RISKS OF EARTHQUAKES, FLOODS, AND OTHER NATURAL CATASTROPHIC EVENTS

OUR CORPORATE HEADQUARTERS, INCLUDING CERTAIN OF OUR RESEARCH AND

DEVELOPMENT OPERATIONS AND OUR MANUFACTURING FACILITIES, ARE LOCATED IN THE SILICON VALLEY AREA OF NORTHERN CALIFORNIA, A REGION KNOWN FOR SEISMIC ACTIVITY. ADDITIONALLY, A CERTAIN NUMBER OF OUR FACILITIES, INCLUDING ONE OF OUR MANUFACTURING

FACILITIES, ARE LOCATED NEAR RIVERS THAT HAVE EXPERIENCED FLOODING IN THE PAST. A SIGNIFICANT NATURAL DISASTER, SUCH AS AN EARTHQUAKE OR A FLOOD, COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR BUSINESS, OPERATING RESULTS, AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

MANMADE PROBLEMS SUCH AS COMPUTER VIRUSES OR TERRORISM MAY DISRUPT OUR

OPERATIONS AND HARM OUR OPERATING RESULTS

DESPITE OUR IMPLEMENTATION OF

NETWORK SECURITY MEASURES, OUR SERVERS ARE VULNERABLE TO COMPUTER VIRUSES, BREAK-INS, AND SIMILAR DISRUPTIONS FROM UNAUTHORIZED TAMPERING WITH OUR COMPUTER SYSTEMS. ANY SUCH EVENT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, OPERATING

RESULTS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. IN ADDITION, THE EFFECTS OF WAR OR ACTS OF TERRORISM COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, OPERATING RESULTS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. THE CONTINUED THREAT OF TERRORISM AND HEIGHTENED SECURITY AND

MILITARY ACTION IN RESPONSE TO THIS THREAT, OR ANY FUTURE ACTS OF TERRORISM, MAY CAUSE FURTHER DISRUPTIONS TO THESE ECONOMIES AND CREATE FURTHER UNCERTAINTIES. SIMILARLY, EVENTS SUCH AS THE RECENT BLACKOUTS IN THE EASTERN UNITED STATES, AND

RECURRENCES OF THESE BLACKOUTS, COULD HAVE SIMILAR NEGATIVE IMPACTS. TO THE EXTENT THAT SUCH DISRUPTIONS OR UNCERTAINTIES RESULT IN DELAYS OR CANCELLATIONS OF CUSTOMER ORDERS, OR THE MANUFACTURE OR SHIPMENT OF OUR PRODUCTS, OUR BUSINESS, OPERATING

RESULTS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION COULD BE MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

WE ARE EXPOSED TO FLUCTUATIONS IN THE MARKET VALUES OF OUR PORTFOLIO INVESTMENTS AND IN INTEREST RATES; IMPAIRMENT OF OUR INVESTMENTS COULD HARM OUR EARNINGS

WE MAINTAIN AN INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO OF VARIOUS HOLDINGS, TYPES AND MATURITIES. THESE SECURITIES ARE GENERALLY CLASSIFIED AS AVAILABLE FOR

SALE AND, CONSEQUENTLY, ARE RECORDED ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS AT FAIR VALUE WITH UNREALIZED GAINS OR LOSSES REPORTED AS A SEPARATE COMPONENT OF ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS), NET OF TAX. PART OF THIS PORTFOLIO INCLUDES

EQUITY INVESTMENTS IN SEVERAL PUBLICLY TRADED COMPANIES, THE VALUES OF WHICH ARE SUBJECT TO MARKET PRICE VOLATILITY. THE CURRENT ECONOMIC DOWNTURN AND OTHER FACTORS HAVE ADVERSELY AFFECTED THE PUBLIC EQUITIES MARKET, AND GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS

MAY CONTINUE TO WORSEN. AS A RESULT, WE MAY

28

TABLE OF CONTENTS

RECOGNIZE IN EARNINGS THE DECLINE IN FAIR VALUE OF OUR PUBLICLY TRADED EQUITY INVESTMENTS BELOW THE COST BASIS WHEN THE

DECLINE IS JUDGED TO BE OTHER- THAN- TEMPORARY. FOR INFORMATION REGARDING THE SENSITIVITY OF AND RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE MARKET VALUE OF PORTFOLIO INVESTMENTS AND INTEREST RATES, REFER TO THE SECTION TITLED QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE

DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK IN OUR 2003 ANNUAL REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS, WHICH IS INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE IN ITEM 7A OF THIS REPORT. FURTHERMORE, OUR EQUITY INVESTMENTS IN BOTH PUBLICLY TRADED COMPANIES AND PRIVATE COMPANIES ARE SUBJECT TO

RISK OF LOSS OF INVESTMENT CAPITAL. THESE INVESTMENTS ARE INHERENTLY RISKY AS THE MARKET FOR THE TECHNOLOGIES OR PRODUCTS THEY HAVE UNDER DEVELOPMENT ARE TYPICALLY IN THE EARLY STAGES AND MAY NEVER MATERIALIZE. WE COULD LOSE OUR ENTIRE INVESTMENT IN

THESE COMPANIES.

IF WE DO NOT SUCCESSFULLY MANAGE OUR STRATEGIC ALLIANCES,

WE MAY EXPERIENCE INCREASED COMPETITION OR DELAYS IN PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT

WE HAVE SEVERAL STRATEGIC ALLIANCES WITH LARGE AND COMPLEX ORGANIZATIONS AND OTHER COMPANIES WITH WHOM WE WORK TO OFFER COMPLEMENTARY PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. THESE ARRANGEMENTS ARE GENERALLY LIMITED TO SPECIFIC PROJECTS, THE GOAL OF WHICH IS

GENERALLY TO FACILITATE PRODUCT COMPATIBILITY AND ADOPTION OF INDUSTRY STANDARDS. IF SUCCESSFUL, THESE RELATIONSHIPS MAY BE MUTUALLY BENEFICIAL AND RESULT IN INDUSTRY GROWTH. HOWEVER, THESE ALLIANCES CARRY AN ELEMENT OF RISK BECAUSE, IN MOST CASES,

WE MUST COMPETE IN SOME BUSINESS AREAS WITH A COMPANY WITH WHICH WE HAVE A STRATEGIC ALLIANCE AND, AT THE SAME TIME, COOPERATE WITH THAT COMPANY IN OTHER BUSINESS AREAS. ALSO, IF THESE COMPANIES FAIL TO PERFORM OR IF THESE RELATIONSHIPS FAIL TO

MATERIALIZE AS EXPECTED, WE COULD SUFFER DELAYS IN PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT OR OTHER OPERATIONAL DIFFICULTIES.

CHANGES IN TELECOMMUNICATIONS REGULATION AND TARIFFS COULD HARM OUR PROSPECTS AND FUTURE SALES

CHANGES IN TELECOMMUNICATIONS REQUIREMENTS IN THE UNITED STATES OR OTHER COUNTRIES COULD AFFECT THE SALES OF OUR PRODUCTS. IN PARTICULAR, WE BELIEVE THAT THERE MAY BE

FUTURE CHANGES IN U.S. TELECOMMUNICATIONS REGULATIONS THAT COULD SLOW THE EXPANSION OF THE SERVICE PROVIDERS NETWORK INFRASTRUCTURES AND MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, OPERATING RESULTS, AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. FUTURE CHANGES IN

TARIFFS BY REGULATORY AGENCIES OR APPLICATION OF TARIFF REQUIREMENTS TO CURRENTLY UNTARIFFED SERVICES COULD AFFECT THE SALES OF OUR PRODUCTS FOR CERTAIN CLASSES OF CUSTOMERS. ADDITIONALLY, IN THE UNITED STATES, OUR PRODUCTS MUST COMPLY WITH VARIOUS

FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION REQUIREMENTS AND REGULATIONS. IN COUNTRIES OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES, OUR PRODUCTS MUST MEET VARIOUS REQUIREMENTS OF LOCAL TELECOMMUNICATIONS AUTHORITIES. CHANGES IN TARIFFS OR FAILURE BY US TO OBTAIN TIMELY

APPROVAL OF PRODUCTS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, OPERATING RESULTS, AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

OUR STOCK PRICE MAY CONTINUE TO BE VOLATILE

OUR COMMON STOCK HAS EXPERIENCED SUBSTANTIAL PRICE VOLATILITY, PARTICULARLY AS A RESULT OF VARIATIONS BETWEEN OUR ACTUAL FINANCIAL RESULTS

AND THE PUBLISHED EXPECTATIONS OF ANALYSTS, AND AS A RESULT OF ANNOUNCEMENTS BY OUR COMPETITORS AND US. FURTHERMORE, SPECULATION IN THE PRESS OR INVESTMENT COMMUNITY ABOUT OUR STRATEGIC POSITION, FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, BUSINESS

OR SIGNIFICANT TRANSACTIONS CAN CAUSE CHANGES IN OUR STOCK PRICE. IN ADDITION, THE STOCK MARKET HAS EXPERIENCED EXTREME PRICE AND VOLUME FLUCTUATIONS THAT HAVE AFFECTED THE MARKET PRICE OF MANY TECHNOLOGY COMPANIES, IN PARTICULAR, AND THAT HAVE

OFTEN BEEN UNRELATED TO THE OPERATING PERFORMANCE OF THESE COMPANIES. THESE FACTORS, AS WELL AS GENERAL ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL CONDITIONS, MAY MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE MARKET PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK IN THE FUTURE. ADDITIONALLY, VOLATILITY

OR A LACK OF POSITIVE PERFORMANCE IN OUR STOCK PRICE MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO RETAIN KEY EMPLOYEES, ALL OF WHOM ARE COMPENSATED IN PART BASED ON THE PERFORMANCE OF OUR STOCK PRICE.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

BEGINNING ON

APRIL 20, 2001, A NUMBER OF PURPORTED SHAREHOLDER CLASS ACTION LAWSUITS WERE FILED IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA AGAINST US AND CERTAIN OF OUR OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS. THE LAWSUITS HAVE BEEN CONSOLIDATED,

AND THE CONSOLIDATED ACTION IS PURPORTEDLY BROUGHT ON BEHALF OF THOSE WHO PURCHASED OUR PUBLICLY TRADED SECURITIES BETWEEN AUGUST 10, 1999 AND FEBRUARY 6, 2001. PLAINTIFFS ALLEGE THAT DEFENDANTS HAVE MADE FALSE AND MISLEADING STATEMENTS, PURPORT TO

ASSERT CLAIMS FOR VIOLATIONS OF THE FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS, AND SEEK UNSPECIFIED COMPENSATORY DAMAGES AND OTHER RELIEF. WE BELIEVE THE CLAIMS ARE WITHOUT MERIT AND INTEND TO DEFEND THE ACTIONS VIGOROUSLY.

IN ADDITION, BEGINNING ON APRIL 23, 2001, A NUMBER OF PURPORTED SHAREHOLDER DERIVATIVE

LAWSUITS WERE FILED IN THE SUPERIOR COURT OF CALIFORNIA, COUNTY OF SANTA CLARA AND IN THE SUPERIOR COURT OF CALIFORNIA, COUNTY OF SAN MATEO. THERE IS A PROCEDURE IN PLACE FOR THE COORDINATION OF SUCH ACTIONS. TWO PURPORTED DERIVATIVE SUITS HAVE ALSO

BEEN FILED IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA, AND THOSE FEDERAL COURT ACTIONS HAVE BEEN CONSOLIDATED. THE CONSOLIDATED FEDERAL COURT DERIVATIVE ACTION WAS DISMISSED BY THE COURT, AND PLAINTIFFS HAVE APPEALED

FROM THAT DECISION. THE COMPLAINTS IN THE VARIOUS DERIVATIVE ACTIONS INCLUDE CLAIMS FOR BREACH OF FIDUCIARY DUTY, WASTE OF CORPORATE ASSETS, MISMANAGEMENT, UNJUST ENRICHMENT, AND VIOLATIONS OF THE CALIFORNIA CORPORATIONS CODE; SEEK COMPENSATORY AND

OTHER DAMAGES, DISGORGEMENT, AND OTHER RELIEF; AND ARE BASED ON ESSENTIALLY THE SAME ALLEGATIONS AS THE CLASS ACTIONS.
