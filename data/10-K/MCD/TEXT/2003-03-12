(c)narrative
description of business
general
the company operates in the food service industry and primarily operates and franchises quick-service restaurant businesses under the mcdonald's brand. these restaurants serve a
varied, yet limited, value-priced menu (see products) in 119 countries around the world.
the
company also operates other restaurant concepts under its partner brands: boston market, chipotle mexican grill and donatos pizzeria, which are all located primarily in the u.s. in
addition, the company has a minority ownership interest in u.k.-based pret a manger. in march2002, the company sold its aroma caf business in the u.k.
since
mcdonald's restaurant business comprises virtually all of the company's consolidated operating results, this narrative primarily relates to the mcdonald's restaurant business,
unless otherwise noted.
all
restaurants are operated by the company or, under the terms of franchise arrangements, by franchisees who are independent entrepreneurs, or by affiliates operating under
joint-venture agreements between the company and local business people.
the
company's operations are designed to assure consistency and high quality at every mcdonald's restaurant. when granting franchises and forming joint-venture agreements, the company is
selective and is not in the practice of franchising to, or partnering with, investor groups or passive investors.
under
the conventional franchise arrangement, franchisees provide capital by initially investing in the equipment, signs, seating and dcor of their restaurant businesses,
and by reinvesting in the business over time. the company shares the investment by generally owning or leasing the land and building. franchisees contribute to the company's revenue stream through
payment of rent and service fees based upon a percent of sales, with specified minimum payments, along with initial fees. the conventional franchise arrangement typically lasts 20years and
franchising practices are generally consistent throughout the world. a discussion regarding site selection is included in parti, item 2, page 4 of this form10-k.
the
company, its franchisees and affiliates purchase food, packaging, equipment, etc., from numerous independent suppliers who have been approved by the company. the company has
established and strictly enforces high quality standards. the company has quality assurance labs around the world that work to ensure that our high standards are consistently met. the quality
assurance process not only involves ongoing product reviews, but also on-site inspections of suppliers' facilities. further, there is a quality assurance board, composed of the company's
technical, safety and supply chain specialists, which provides strategic global leadership for all aspects of food quality and safety. in addition, the company works closely with suppliers to
encourage innovation, assure best practices and drive continuous improvement.
independently
owned and operated distribution centers, also approved by the company, distribute products and supplies to most mcdonald's restaurants. in addition, restaurant personnel
are trained in the proper storage, handling and preparation of our products and in the delivery of customer service.
mcdonald's
global brand is well known. marketing, promotional and public relations activities are designed to nurture mcdonald's brand image and differentiate the company from
competitors. marketing and promotional efforts focus on value, food taste and the customer experience. in addition, the company is focused on being a leader in the area of social responsibility, as
the company believes it is important to give back to the people and communities around the world who are responsible for our success.
products
mcdonald's restaurants offer a substantially uniform menu. in addition, mcdonald's tests new products on an ongoing basis.
mcdonald's
menu includes hamburgers and cheeseburgers, big mac, quarter pounder with cheese, big n' tasty, filet-o-fish and several chicken sandwiches, chicken
mcnuggets, french fries, salads, milk shakes, mcflurry desserts, sundaes and soft serve cones, pies, cookies and soft drinks and other beverages. in addition, the restaurants sell a variety of other
products during limited-time promotions.
mcdonald's
restaurants operating in the u. s. and certain international markets are open during breakfast hours and offer a full- or limited-breakfast menu. breakfast
offerings may include the egg mcmuffin and sausage mcmuffin with egg sandwiches, hotcakes, biscuit and bagel sandwiches and muffins.
chipotle
serves gourmet burritos and tacos. donatos sells pizza, submarine sandwiches and salads. boston market is a home-meal replacement concept serving chicken, meatloaf
and a variety of other main and side dishes. pret a manger is a quick-service food concept that serves mainly prepared and packaged cold sandwiches, snacks and drinks during lunchtime.
intellectual property
the company owns valuable intellectual property including trademarks, service marks, patents, copyrights, trade secrets and other proprietary information, some of which,
including "mcdonald's," "ronald mcdonald," "big mac" and other related
marks, are of material importance to the company's business. the company also has certain patents on restaurant equipment which, while valuable, are not material to its business.
seasonal operations
the company does not consider its operations to be seasonal to any material degree.
working capital practices
information about the company's working capital practices is incorporated herein by reference to management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of
operations for the years ended december31, 2002, 2001 and 2000 in partii, item 7, pages 9 through 22, and the consolidated statement of cash flows for the years ended
december31, 2002, 2001 and 2000 in partii, item 8, page 26 of this form10-k.
customers
the company's business is not dependent upon a single customer or small group of customers.
backlog
company-operated restaurants have no backlog orders.
government contracts
no material portion of the business is subject to renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts or subcontracts at the election of the u.s. government.
competition
mcdonald's restaurants compete with international, national, regional and local retailers of food products. the company competes on the basis of price, convenience and service
and by offering quality food products. the company's competition in the broadest perspective includes restaurants, quick-service eating establishments, pizza parlors, coffee shops, street vendors,
convenience food stores, delicatessens and supermarkets.
in
the u.s., there were about 526,000 restaurants that generated $320billion in annual sales in 2002. mcdonald's restaurant business accounts for 2.6% of those restaurants and
6.3% of the sales. no reasonable estimate can be made of the number of competitors outside the u.s.
research and development
the
company operates a research and development facility in illinois. while research and development activities are important to the company's business, these expenditures are not material.
independent suppliers also conduct research activities for the benefit of the mcdonald's system, which includes franchisees and suppliers, as well as the company, its subsidiaries and joint ventures.
environmental matters
the company is not aware of any federal, state or local environmental laws or regulations that will materially affect its earnings or competitive position, or result in material
capital expenditures; however, the company cannot predict the effect on its operations of possible future environmental legislation or regulations. during 2002, there were no material capital
expenditures for environmental control facilities and no such material expenditures are anticipated.
number of employees
during 2002, the company's average number of employees worldwide, including company-operated restaurant employees, was approximately 413,000. this includes employees at
mcdonald's company-operated restaurants as well as other restaurant concepts operated by the company.

item 2. properties
the company identifies and develops sites that offer convenience to customers and long-term sales and profit potential to the company. to assess potential, the
company analyzes traffic and walking patterns, census data, school enrollments and other relevant data. the company's experience and access to advanced technology aid in evaluating this information.
the company generally owns the land and building or secures long-term land and building leases for restaurant sites, which ensures long-term occupancy rights and helps control
related costs. restaurant profitability for both the company and franchisees is important; therefore, ongoing efforts are made to control average development costs through construction and design
efficiencies and standardization and by leveraging the company's global sourcing network. additional information about the company's properties is included in
management's
discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in partii, item 7, pages 9 through 22 and in financial statements and supplementary data in
partii, item 8, pages 23 through 39 of this form10-k.

company's entire business. the following is a brief description of the more significant of these categories of lawsuits. in addition, the company is subject to various federal, state and local
regulations that impact various aspects of its business, as discussed below. the company does not believe that any such claims, lawsuits or regulations will have a material adverse effect on its
financial condition or results of operations.
franchising
a substantial number of mcdonald's restaurants are franchised to independent entrepreneurs operating under arrangements with the company. in the course of the franchise
relationship, occasional disputes arise between the company and its franchisees relating to a broad range of subjects including, but not limited to, quality, service and cleanliness issues,
contentions regarding grants or terminations of franchises, franchisee claims for additional franchises or rewrites of franchises, and delinquent payments. additionally, occasional disputes arise
between the company and individuals who claim they should have been granted a mcdonald's franchise.
suppliers
the company and its affiliates and subsidiaries do not supply, with minor exceptions outside the u.s., food, paper or related items to any mcdonald's restaurants. the company

a number of issues including, by way of example, compliance with product specifications and the company's business relationship with suppliers. in addition, disputes occasionally arise on a number of
issues between the company and individuals or entities who claim that they should be (or should have been) granted the opportunity to supply products or services to the company's restaurants.
employees
thousands of people are employed by the company and in restaurants owned and operated by subsidiaries of the company. in addition, thousands of people, from time to time, seek
employment in such restaurants. in the ordinary course of business, disputes arise regarding hiring, firing and promotion practices.
customers
the company's restaurants serve a large cross-section of the public. in the course of serving so many people, disputes arise as to products, service, accidents, advertising,
nutritional and other disclosures as well as other matters typical of an extensive restaurant business such as that of the company.
intellectual property
the company has registered trademarks and service marks, some of which are of material importance to the company's business. the company also has certain patents on restaurant
equipment which, while valuable, are not material to its business. from time to time, the company may become involved in litigation to defend and protect its use of its intellectual property.
government regulations
local, state and federal governments have adopted laws and regulations involving various aspects of the restaurant business, including, but not limited to, franchising, health,
safety, environment, zoning and employment. the company does not believe that it is in violation of any existing statutory or administrative rules, but it cannot predict the effect on its operations

the approximate number of shareholders of record and beneficial owners of the company's common stock as of january31, 2003 was estimated to be 1,032,000.
given
the company's returns on equity and assets, management believes it is prudent to reinvest a significant portion of earnings back into the business and use excess cash flow for debt
repayments and share repurchases. accordingly, the common stock dividend yield is modest. the company has paid dividends on common stock for 27 consecutive years through 2002 and has increased the
dividend amount at least once every year. additional dividend increases will be considered after reviewing returns to shareholders, profitability expectations, financing needs and tax treatment of
dividends. dividends are declared and paid on an annual basis. as in the past, future dividends will be declared at the discretion of the company's board of directors.

(1) includes pretax operating charges of $853million ($700million after tax or $0.55 per share) primarily related to restructuring markets and eliminating positions,
restaurant closings/asset impairment and the write-off of technology costs. (the cash portion of this pretax expense was approximately $100million after tax.) see page 9 for
further details.  (2) includes $378million of pretax operating charges primarily related to the u.s. business reorganization and other global change initiatives, and
restaurant closing/asset
impairment charges discussed on page 9.  (3) includes pretax operating charges of $322million ($219million after tax or $0.16 per share) consisting of
$162million of made for you costs and the
$160million charge related to the home office productivity initiative.  (4) includes a net pretax expense of $253million ($143million after tax or $0.11 per
share) consisting of $378million of pretax operating charges noted in
(2)above and $125million of net pretax nonoperating income primarily related to a gain on the initial public offering of mcdonald's japan. (the cash portion of this net pretax expense
was approximately $100million after tax.) see page 9 for further details. net income also reflects an effective tax rate of 29.8percent, primarily due to the benefit of tax law changes
in certain international markets ($147million).  (5) in 2002, includes a $98.6million after-tax charge ($0.08 per sharebasic and $0.07 per sharediluted)
to reflect the cumulative effect of
the adoption of sfas no.142, goodwill and other intangible assets, which eliminates the amortization of goodwill and instead subjects it to annual
impairment tests. see page 17 for further discussion. net income per share, adjusted for the nonamortization provisions of sfas no.142, would have been $0.02 higher than the amount reported
for 2001 and 2000 and $0.01 higher for 1996-1999.  (6) systemwide sales include sales by all restaurants, whether operated by the company, by franchisees or by affiliates
operating under joint-venture agreements. see page 11 for further
discussion.  (7) see page 17 for detail of systemwide restaurants by geographic segment and partner brand.
item 7.management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations
nature of business
the company operates in the food service industry and primarily operates and franchises quick-service restaurant businesses under the mcdonald's brand (mcdonald's restaurants).
approximately 80% of mcdonald's restaurants and about 75% of the total revenues of mcdonald's restaurants are in nine markets: australia, brazil, canada, china, france, germany, japan (a 50%-owned
affiliate accounted for under the equity method), the united kingdom and the united states. throughout this discussion, mcdonald's restaurant businesses in these nine markets collectively are referred
to as "major markets."
the
company also operates other restaurant concepts under its partner brands: boston market, chipotle mexican grill and donatos pizzeria. in addition, the company has a minority
ownership in pret a manger. in march2002, the company sold its aroma caf business in the u.k.

strategic actions
in
2002, the company initiated several strategic actions designed to optimize existing restaurant operations and improve the business. these actions were consistent with management's strategy of
concentrating its capital and resources on the best near-term opportunities and of avoiding those that distract from restaurant-level execution. they included the restructuring of certain
markets, the closing of a significant number of underperforming restaurants, the decision to terminate a long-term technology project, and the consolidation of certain home office
facilities and elimination of positions to control costs, streamline operations and reallocate resources.
in
2001, the company implemented strategic changes and restaurant initiatives in the u.s. and certain international markets. the changes in the u.s. included streamlining operations by
reducing the number of regions and divisions, enabling the company to combine staff functions and improve efficiency.
the
company recorded charges and/or gains associated with these actions in 2002 and 2001 as "significant items." significant items generally represent charges and/or gains for actions or
transactions related to the implementation of special initiatives of the company or items that are unusual or infrequent in nature. the company does not include these items when reviewing business
performance trends,
because
management does not believe these are indicative of ongoing operations.
the
company recorded $853million of significant items in 2002 and $253million of significant items in 2001. all significant items for both years were recorded in other
operating expense, except as noted in the discussion that follows.

restructuring chargesrestructuring markets and eliminating positions
in 2002, the company recorded $267million of pretax charges related to transferring ownership in four countries in the middle east and latin america to developmental
licensees (approximately 150 restaurants), ceasing operations in three countries in latin america (approximately 20 restaurants), and eliminating positions (approximately 600 positions, about half of
which were in the u.s. and half of which were in international markets), reallocating resources and consolidating certain home office facilities to control costs. under the developmental license
business structure, which the company successfully employs in more than 25 markets outside the u.s. (approximately 350 restaurants), the licensee owns the business, including the real estate interest.
while the company generally does not have any capital invested in these markets, it receives a royalty based on a percent of sales.
the
2002 restructuring charges consisted of: $136million of asset write-offs and losses on the sale of assets and $65million of costs for leases and other
obligations in the markets restructured or exited, $56million of severance and other employee-related costs, $15million of lease cancellation and other costs related to the closing of
certain home office facilities, and $10million of payments made to facilitate a change of ownership from u.s. franchisees who have had a history of financial difficulty and consequently were
unable to deliver the level of operational excellence needed to succeed in the future. these changes were partially offset by a $15million reversal of accrued restructuring costs recorded in
2001, primarily due to lower employee-related costs than originally estimated.
in
2001, the company recorded $200million of pretax restructuring charges related to the strategic changes and restaurant initiatives in the u.s. and certain international
markets. the initiatives were designed to improve the restaurant experience and included accelerated operations training, restaurant simplification, incentives for outstanding restaurant operations
and an enhanced national restaurant evaluation system. in connection with these initiatives, the company eliminated approximately 850 positions, consisting of 700 positions in the u.s., primarily in
the divisions and regions, and 150 positions in international markets.
the
2001 restructuring charges consisted of: $114million of severance and other employee-related costs, $69million of lease cancellation and other costs related to the
closing of region and division facilities, and $17million of other cash costs, primarily consisting of payments made to facilitate a change of ownership from u.s. franchisees who have had a
history of financial difficulty and consequently were unable to deliver the level of operational excellence needed to succeed in the future.
restaurant closings/asset impairment
in 2002, the company recorded $402million of pretax charges consisting of: $302million related to management's decision to close 751 underperforming restaurants
(234 were closed in 2002 and 517 will close throughout 2003) primarily in the u.s. and japan, and $100million primarily related to the impairment of assets for certain existing restaurants in
europe and latin america. most of the restaurants identified for closing had negative cash flows and/or very low annual sales volumes. also, in many cases they would have required significant capital
investment over the next several years to remain financially viable.
in
2001, the company recorded $135million of pretax charges consisting of: $91million related to the closing of 163 underperforming restaurants in international markets
in 2001, a $24million asset impairment charge due to an assessment of the ongoing impact of turkey's significant currency devaluation on our business, and $20million related to the
disposition of aroma caf in the u.k.
although
restaurant closings occur each year, these 2002 and 2001 restaurant closing charges are identified as "significant items" because they were the result of separate intensive
reviews by management in conjunction with other strategic actions.
technology write-offs and other charges
in 2002, the company recorded $184million of pretax charges consisting of: $170million primarily related to the write-off of software development
costs as a result of management's decision to terminate a long-term technology project, and $14million primarily related to the write-off of receivables and inventory
in venezuela as a result of the temporary closure of all mcdonald's restaurants due to the national strike that began in early december. although the terminated technology project was projected to
deliver long-term benefits, it was no longer viewed as the best use of capital in the current environment, as the anticipated systemwide cost over several years was expected to be in
excess of $1billion.
in
2001, the company recorded $55million of pretax charges consisting of: $18million primarily related to the write-off of certain technology,
$12million (recorded in nonoperating expense) primarily related to the write-off of a corporate investment, and $25million primarily related to
the
unrecoverable costs incurred in connection with the theft of winning game pieces from the company's monopoly and certain other promotional games over an extended period of time, and the related
termination of the supplier of the game pieces. fifty individuals (none of whom were company employees) were convicted of conspiracy and/or mail fraud charges.
mcdonald's japan ipo gain
in 2001, mcdonald's japan, the company's largest market in the asia/pacific, middle east and africa (apmea) segment, completed an ipo of 12million shares. the company
owns 50% of mcdonald's japan, while the company's founding partner den fujita and his family own approximately 26%. the company recorded a $137million gain (pre and after tax) in nonoperating
income to reflect an increase in the carrying value of its investment as a result of the cash proceeds from the ipo received by mcdonald's japan.
effect of foreign currencies on reported results
while
changing foreign currencies affect reported results, mcdonald's lessens exposures, where practical, by financing in local currencies, hedging certain foreign-denominated cash flows and by
purchasing goods and services in local currencies.

in
2002, foreign currency translation had a minimal impact on the revenue growth rate as the stronger euro and british pound were offset by weaker latin american currencies (primarily
the argentine peso, brazilian real and venezuelan bolivar). the operating income growth rate for 2002 was positively impacted by foreign currency translation primarily due to the stronger euro and
british pound. in 2001, foreign currency translation had a negative impact on the growth rates primarily due to the weaker euro, british pound, australian dollar, japanese yen and canadian dollar.
all
information presented in constant currencies excludes the effect of foreign currency translation on reported results except for hyperinflationary economies, whose functional currency
is the u.s. dollar. constant currency results are calculated by translating the current year results at prior year average exchange rates.
systemwide sales
systemwide
sales include sales by all restaurants, whether operated by the company, by franchisees or by affiliates operating under joint-venture agreements. management believes that systemwide sales
information is useful in analyzing the company's revenues because franchisees and affiliates pay rent, service fees and/or royalties that generally are based on a percent of sales with specified
minimum payments.

restaurant expansion, partly offset by negative comparable sales, drove the consolidated constant currency sales increases in 2002 and 2001.
sales
in the u.s. increased in 2002 and 2001 due to expansion. results in 2002 reflected the overall slowdown in the restaurant industry and increased competition.
the
primary contributors to europe's constant currency sales growth in both years were france and russia. in addition, the u.k. contributed to the increases in 2002 and 2001, although
comparable sales were negative in both years. europe's results for both years were impacted by negative comparable sales in germany, where the economy continued to contract. we expect the difficult
economic conditions in germany to continue in the near term. in 2001, despite the company's outstanding quality and safety record, europe's results were negatively impacted by consumer confidence
issues regarding the european beef supply in several markets.
sales
results in apmea declined in 2002 in constant currencies primarily due to negative comparable sales in japan, which were in part due to continuing weak economic conditions, partly
offset by a strong performance in australia and expansion in china. in 2001, the constant currency sales increase was driven by strong results in china, partly offset by weak results in japan, taiwan
and turkey, and weak consumer spending in australia. beginning in late 2001 and continuing in 2002, sales were also dampened by consumer confidence issues regarding food safety throughout japan.
in
latin america, constant currency sales increased in both 2002 and 2001, despite the fact that many markets continued to be impacted by weak economic conditions. the increase in 2002
was primarily due to positive comparable sales in brazil and expansion in mexico, while in 2001 positive comparable sales in mexico and venezuela drove the increase.
the
company expects the weak economic conditions in many markets in apmea (including japan) and latin america to continue in the near term.
in canada, constant currency sales increased in 2002 due to expansion, partly offset by negative comparable sales, while the 2001 constant currency sales increase was driven by positive
comparable sales and expansion.
the
sales increase in partner brands in 2002 was primarily due to expansion and positive comparable sales at chipotle. the sales increase in 2001 was primarily due to the acquisition of
boston market in second quarter 2000. in addition, expansion of chipotle along with strong comparable sales at chipotle and boston market helped drive the increase in 2001.

average annual salesmcdonald's restaurants
average sales per restaurant in constant currencies are affected by comparable sales as well as the size, location and number of new restaurants. the number of new restaurants
affects average sales because new restaurants typically take a few years to reach long-term sales volumes. in addition, over the last several years more restaurants outside the u.s. have
opened in less populated areas and in countries with lower average sales volumes and correspondingly lower average development costs.

in 2002, average annual sales per traditional restaurant in the u.s. declined slightly primarily due to negative comparable sales. in europe, average annual sales
per traditional restaurant were relatively flat in constant currencies. in apmea and canada, average annual sales per traditional restaurant declined in constant currencies primarily due to negative
comparable sales and the impact of new restaurants. in latin america, average annual sales per traditional restaurant increased slightly in constant currencies due to positive comparable sales. all
segments benefited from the closing of underperforming restaurants in 2002 and 2001.
in
2001, average annual sales per traditional restaurant were relatively flat for the u.s. and canada in constant currencies. in other segments, negative comparable sales and the
significant number of new restaurants, partly offset by the benefit of closing underperforming restaurants, drove the decreases in average annual sales per traditional restaurant.
satellite
restaurants generally have significantly lower development costs and sales volumes than traditional restaurants. the use of these small, limited-menu restaurants
has allowed profitable expansion into areas that otherwise would not be feasible (e.g., discount retail stores and airports). in 2002 and 2001, average annual sales for satellite restaurants increased
in the u.s. this was due in part to our continued assessment of the appropriate use of these limited-menu sites and the closing of certain low-volume sites. outside the u.s.,
average annual sales for satellite restaurants declined in constant currencies in both years primarily due to negative comparable sales in japan, where the majority of satellites outside the u.s. are
located. in connection with the restaurant closings previously discussed, the company's japanese affiliate will close more than 100 satellite restaurants in 2003.
revenues
revenues
include sales by company-operated restaurants and fees from restaurants operated by franchisees or affiliates under joint-venture agreements. these fees include rent, service fees and/or
royalties that are based on a percent of sales with specified minimum payments along with initial fees. fees vary by type of site and investment by the company and also according to local business
conditions. these fees, along with occupancy and operating rights, are stipulated in franchise agreements that generally have 20-year terms.
revenues
grow as sales build in existing restaurants and as new restaurants are added. menu price changes also affect revenues and sales, but it is impractical to quantify their impact
because of different pricing structures, new products, promotions and product-mix variations among restaurants and markets.
systemwide
sales and revenues may grow at different rates during a given period, primarily due to a change in the mix of company-operated, franchised and affiliated restaurants. for
example, this mix is impacted by purchases and sales of restaurants between the company and franchisees. company-operated restaurants generated about 30% of systemwide sales and about 75% of revenues
for all periods presented.

on a constant currency basis, total revenues increased at a higher rate than systemwide sales in 2002 primarily due to significantly lower sales
from our affiliate in japan. under our affiliate structure, we record a royalty in revenues based on a percentage of japan's sales, whereas all of japan's sales are included in systemwide sales. for
this reason, japan's sales decline had a larger negative impact on systemwide sales than on revenues. in 2001, total revenues increased at a higher rate than systemwide sales primarily due to the
second quarter 2000 acquisition of boston market restaurants, which were all company-operated, and the restructuring of our ownership in the philippines, effective july1, 2001. as a result of
the restructuring, most of our restaurants in the philippines are now company-operated rather than franchised. in addition, revenues in 2001 benefited from an increase in the royalty percent received
from our japanese affiliate, effective january1, 2001.
in
the u.s., growth rates for systemwide sales and total revenues were similar in 2002 and 2001. in both periods, europe's total revenue growth rates were lower than the systemwide sales
growth rates primarily due to a lower percentage of company-operated restaurants and an increase in rent assistance to franchisees compared with the prior year. apmea's total revenue growth rates were
higher than the systemwide sales growth rates for both periods primarily due to our affiliate structure in japan and a higher percentage of company-operated restaurants, in part due to the
restructuring of the philippines. in addition, the total revenue growth rate in 2001 benefited from an increase in the royalty percent received from our japanese affiliate. in latin america, total
revenue growth rates were higher than systemwide sales growth rates for both periods primarily due to a higher percentage of company-operated restaurants compared with the prior year.
operating income
consolidated
operating income decreased $584million or 22% in 2002 and $633million or 19% in 2001; however, significant charges of $853million in 2002 and $378million
in 2001 were included in operating income. operating income for both years included higher selling, general& administrative expenses and lower other operating income. combined operating margin
dollars were higher in 2002 than in 2001 and lower in 2001 than in 2000.
operating
income from the major markets accounted for substantially all of consolidated operating income in 2002, 2001 and 2000.
the
following table presents reported operating income amounts and growth rates along with the growth rates adjusted for foreign currency translation and significant items. adjusted
constant currency operating income is one of the primary measures used to evaluate segment performance, because management believes that adjusted constant currency operating income reflects the most
accurate representation of ongoing business operations.

u.s.
adjusted operating income decreased 2% in 2002 and was relatively flat in 2001 compared with 2000. the decrease in 2002 was due to lower combined operating margin dollars and lower
other operating income, partly offset by lower selling, general& administrative expenses. other operating income included $22million of payments made to u.s. owner/operators to
facilitate the introduction of a new front counter team service system. in 2001, higher combined operating margin dollars were offset by higher selling, general& administrative expenses and
slightly lower other operating income. u.s. adjusted operating income accounted for more than 50% of consolidated adjusted operating income in 2002, 2001 and 2000.
europe's
adjusted operating income accounted for more than 35% of consolidated adjusted operating income in 2002, 2001 and 2000. europe's adjusted operating income was relatively flat in
2002 compared with 2001 and decreased 3% in 2001. the segment's results benefited from strong performances in france and russia in both years; however, difficult economic conditions in germany and
weak results in the u.k. negatively impacted results. in 2001, consumer confidence issues regarding the european beef supply negatively impacted europe's results. france, germany and the u.k.
accounted for about 75% of europe's adjusted operating income in all three years.
apmea's
adjusted operating income decreased 23% in 2002 and 10% in 2001. in 2002, strong results in australia were more than offset by weak results in japan and hong kong. in 2001,
strong results in china, the increase in the royalty percent received from our affiliate in japan and a gain on the sale of real estate in singapore were more than offset by weak results in australia,
japan, taiwan and turkey. australia, japan and china accounted for about 70% of apmea's adjusted operating income in all three years.
latin
america's adjusted operating income declined significantly for both periods due to the continuing difficult economic conditions experienced by most markets in the segment. in
addition, latin america's results in 2002 were negatively impacted by a higher provision for uncollectible receivables as well as the temporary closure of all mcdonald's restaurants in venezuela due
to the national strike that began in early december2002. although the strike ended in february2003, the company expects the continued turmoil in venezuela to impact results in 2003.
the
adjusted operating results for the partner brands improved 22% in 2002 and were flat in 2001 compared with 2000. the improvement in 2002 was primarily driven by the elimination of
goodwill amortization beginning january1, 2002 and continued strong results at chipotle.
the
corporate segment reflected higher spending on technology in 2002 and 2001.
operating margins
operating
margin information and discussions relate to mcdonald's restaurants only and exclude partner brands.
company-operated margins
company-operated margin dollars represent sales by company-operated restaurants less the operating costs of these restaurants. company-operated margin dollars declined
$12million in 2002 and $145million in 2001. in constant currencies, company-operated margin dollars declined $41million or 3% in 2002 and $96million or 6% in 2001.
the
constant currency decreases in both years were primarily due to negative comparable sales and higher labor rates, partly offset by expansion.

operating
cost trends as a percent of sales were as follows: food& paper costs decreased in 2002 and increased in 2001; payroll costs as well as occupancy& other
operating expenses increased for both periods.
the
u.s. company-operated margin percent in 2002 benefited from the elimination of goodwill amortization and a lower contribution rate to the national co-op for advertising
expenses. however, these benefits were offset by negative comparable
sales and higher labor costs. food& paper costs were lower as a percent of sales in 2002 and 2001, while payroll costs were higher in both years. occupancy& other operating expenses as
a percent of sales were lower in 2002 than in 2001 and higher in 2001 than in 2000.
europe's
company-operated margins as a percent of sales declined in 2002, primarily due to higher payroll and occupancy costs, partly offset by lower food& paper costs as a
percent of sales. in 2001, europe's company-operated margin percent declined, primarily due to higher payroll costs and negative comparable sales.
in
apmea, negative comparable sales in 2002 and 2001 affected company-operated margins as a percent of sales. in 2001, a change in restaurant classification in the philippines also
contributed to apmea's margin decline because its company-operated margins were lower than the average for the segment. in latin america, declines in margins as a percent of sales in both years were
due to difficult economic conditions in most markets. in canada, negative comparable sales in 2002 affected company-operated margins as a percent of sales.
franchised margins
franchised margin dollars represent revenues from franchised and affiliated restaurants less the company's occupancy costs (rent and depreciation) associated with those sites.
franchised margin dollars represented more than 60% of the combined operating margins in 2002, 2001 and 2000. franchised margin dollars increased $36million in 2002 and $26million in
2001. in constant currencies, franchised margin dollars were relatively flat in 2002 and increased $91million or 3% in 2001. the constant currency increase in 2001 was primarily driven by
expansion and an increase in the japan royalty percent.

the
declines in the consolidated franchised margin percent in 2002 and 2001 reflected negative comparable sales, higher rent assistance to franchisees primarily in the u.s. and europe,
and higher occupancy costs, due in part to an increased proportion of leased sites in all geographic segments. apmea's franchised margin percent in both years benefited from the restructuring of our
ownership in the philippines in july2001. the restructuring resulted in the reclassification of restaurants and related margins, that were lower than the average for the segment, from
franchised to company-operated. in addition, the franchised margin percent in apmea in 2001 benefited from the increase in the japan royalty percent.
selling, general& administrative expenses
consolidated
selling, general& administrative expenses increased 3% in 2002 and 5% in 2001 (4% and 7% in constant currencies). the increase in 2002 was primarily due to increased spending on
technology in the corporate segment, higher advertising expenses in the u.s. primarily related to the introduction of the dollar menu, and higher expenses for partner brands. the increase in 2001 was
due to increased spending on technology in the corporate segment and higher expenses for partner brands, partly offset by lower company-wide performance-based incentive compensation
compared with the prior year. selling, general& administrative expenses as a percent of sales were 4.1% in 2002 and 2001 and 4.0% in 2000.

gains on sales of restaurant businesses
gains on sales of restaurant businesses include gains from sales of company-operated restaurants as well as gains from exercises of purchase options by franchisees with business
facilities lease arrangements (arrangements where the company leases the businesses, including equipment, to franchisees who have options to purchase the businesses). the company's purchases and sales
of businesses with its franchisees and affiliates are aimed at achieving an optimal ownership mix in each market. resulting gains or losses are recorded in operating income because the transactions
are an integral part of our business.
equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates
equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliatesbusinesses in which the company actively participates but does not controlis reported after interest
expense and income taxes, except for u.s. restaurant partnerships, which are reported before income taxes. the decrease in 2002 was due to a net loss from our japanese affiliate. the decrease in 2001
was due to lower earnings from our japanese affiliate, the increase in japan's royalty expense and a weaker japanese yen. although the increase in royalty expense reduced mcdonald's equity in earnings
for japan in 2001 compared with 2000, it was more than offset at the operating income level by the royalty benefit mcdonald's received in franchised revenues.
team service system payments
in 2002, the company made payments to u.s. owner/operators to facilitate the introduction of a new front counter team service system.
bad debts and other expense
bad debts and other expense for 2002 and 2001 increased primarily due to higher provisions for uncollectible receivables (primarily in europe and latin america). in addition,
other expense for 2002 was partly offset by a benefit from the elimination of goodwill amortization.
interest expense
interest
expense decreased in 2002 due to lower average interest rates, partly offset by higher average debt levels and stronger foreign currencies. interest expense increased in 2001 due to higher
average debt levels, partly offset by weaker foreign currencies and lower average interest rates. average debt levels were higher in both years because the company used its available credit capacity
to repurchase shares of its common stock.
nonoperating expense, net
nonoperating
expense includes miscellaneous income and expense items such as interest income, minority interests, and gains and losses related to other investments, financings and translation.
nonoperating expense in 2002 reflected higher minority interest expense and foreign currency translation losses in 2002 compared with foreign currency translation gains in 2001. in addition,
nonoperating expense in 2001 included $12million primarily related to the write-off of a corporate investment as well as minority interest expense related to the sale of real
estate in singapore.

the
2001 effective income tax rate reflected a benefit from the impact of tax law changes in certain international markets and the 2000 effective income tax rate reflected a tax benefit
resulting from an international transaction.
consolidated
net deferred tax liabilities included tax assets, net of valuation allowance, of $867million in 2002 and $720million in 2001. substantially all of the net
tax assets arose in the u.s. and other profitable markets.
cumulative effect of accounting change
effective
january1, 2002, the company adopted sfas no.142, goodwill and other intangible assets, which eliminates the amortization of
goodwill and instead subjects it to annual impairment tests. as a result of the initial required goodwill impairment test, the company recorded a noncash charge of $99million after tax ($0.07
per diluted share) in first quarter 2002
to reflect the cumulative effect of this accounting change. the impaired goodwill was primarily in argentina, uruguay and other markets in latin america and the middle east, where economies have
weakened significantly in recent years.
net income and net income per common share
in
2002, income before the cumulative effect of the goodwill accounting change decreased $645million or 39%, and diluted income per common share before the cumulative effect of this accounting
change decreased $0.48 or 38%. net income, which included the charge for the cumulative effect of the accounting change decreased 45% and diluted net income per common share decreased 44%. in 2001,
net income decreased $340million or 17% and diluted net income per common share decreased $0.21 or 14%. results for 2002 included significant charges of $700million or $0.55 per share,
and results for 2001 included significant items totaling $143million or $0.11 of expense per share discussed on page9.
cash flows
the company generates significant cash from operations and has substantial credit capacity to fund operating and discretionary spending. cash from operations totaled
$2.9billion and exceeded capital expenditures by $886million in 2002, while cash from operations totaled $2.7billion and exceeded capital expenditures by $782million in
2001. cash provided by operations, along with borrowings and other sources of cash, is used for capital expenditures, share repurchases, dividends and debt repayments. the company expects to use
future cash provided by operations to fund the remaining employee severance and lease obligations associated with the significant charges in 2002 and 2001.

(primarily japan)1,923, 1,879, 1,681; latin america19, 46, 45; and canada330, 307, 280.
in 2002, the company opened 1,247 traditional mcdonald's restaurants and 392 satellite restaurants, and closed 474 traditional restaurants and 158 satellite restaurants. in
2001, the company opened 1,406 traditional mcdonald's restaurants and 383 satellite restaurants, and closed 335 traditional restaurants and 135 satellite restaurants.
in
2002, about 85% of mcdonald's restaurant additions occurred in the major markets. approximately 60% of company-operated restaurants and more than 85% of franchised restaurants were
located in the major markets at the end of 2002. franchisees and affiliates operated 73% of
mcdonald's
restaurants at year-end 2002. partner brand restaurants are primarily company-operated.
capital
expenditures increased $98million or 5% in 2002 and decreased $39million or 2% in 2001. the increase in capital expenditures in 2002 was primarily due to higher
spending for mcdonald's restaurant business in the u.s. and canada, partly offset by lower capital expenditures for new restaurants in latin america. the decrease in 2001 was primarily due to lower
spending in europe and latin america and weaker foreign currencies, partly offset by additional expenditures for partner brands as well as for mcdonald's restaurant business in the u.s. and china.
capital expenditures for mcdonald's restaurants in 2002, 2001 and 2000 reflected our strategy of leasing a higher proportion of new sites and also the u.s. building program, which gave franchisees the
option to own new restaurant buildings.
the
company's expenditures for new restaurants in the u.s. were lower than they would have been as a result of the leasing strategy and the u.s. building program. about 65% in 2002 and
80% in 2001 of new and rebuilt u.s. traditional franchised and affiliated restaurant buildings were purchased by franchisees and affiliates. beginning in 2003, to give our best franchisees additional
financial flexibility to purchase more mcdonald's restaurant businesses as well as to reinvest in their existing restaurants, the company plans to purchase buildings for new franchised restaurants. as
a result of owning the buildings, the company expects to collect additional rent from the franchisees. in addition, the company is purchasing a higher proportion of land for new restaurants in the
u.s.
the
company and its affiliates owned 38% of the land for its restaurant sites at year-end 2002 and 2001. for leased land, the company maintains long-term
occupancy rights for the land and receives related rental income.
capital
expenditures invested in major markets excluding japan represented approximately 70% of the total in 2002 and 60% in 2001 and 2000. (japan is accounted for under the equity
method, and accordingly, its capital expenditures are not included in consolidated amounts.)

primarily for computer equipment and furnishings for office buildings.
average development costs incurred by the u.s. system (land, building and equipment) for new traditional mcdonald's restaurants were $1.7million in 2002
and 2001 and $1.6million in 2000.
average
development costs outside the u.s. vary widely by market depending on the types of restaurants built and the real estate and construction costs within each market. these costs,
which include land, buildings and equipment owned by the company, are managed through the use of optimally sized restaurants, construction and design efficiencies, standardization and global sourcing.
in addition, foreign currency fluctuations affect average development costs.
average
development costs for new traditional mcdonald's restaurants in major markets outside the u.s. excluding japan were approximately $1.6million in 2002, 2001 and 2000.
average annual sales for new traditional mcdonald's restaurants in the same markets were about $1.3million in 2002 and 2001 and $1.5million in 2000. average development costs for new
satellite restaurants (excluding lease costs) located in canada, germany and japan, which comprise about 95% of the satellites outside the u.s., were about $250,000 in 2002 and about $220,000 in 2001
and 2000. the use of these small, limited-menu restaurants, for which the land and building generally are leased, has allowed expansion into areas that otherwise would not have been
feasible.
capital
expenditures by affiliates in international markets, primarily japan, which were not included in consolidated amounts, were about $204million in 2002, $181million
in 2001 and $204million in 2000.
off-balance sheet arrangements
the
company and six unaffiliated companies that supply the "mcdonald's system" (mcdonald's franchisees, suppliers and the company) are equal owners of system capital corporation (scc). scc's purpose
is to provide funding to mcdonald's franchisees, suppliers to the mcdonald's system and mcdonald's corporation and to build equity within scc that will benefit the mcdonald's system. no employees of
scc are employees of the seven shareholders. scc competes with other lenders who provide similar financing to mcdonald's franchisees and suppliers and the company has no independent obligation to
provide financing to these franchisees and suppliers. scc's function is similar to that of a cooperative and its primary operating activities include (1)providing loans to qualifying u.s.
franchisees to purchase existing restaurant businesses as well as finance equipment, buildings and working capital, (2)purchasing accounts receivable and financing inventory and other needs of
eligible suppliers and distributors, and (3)acquiring land and leasing it to mcdonald's corporation for new restaurants, primarily in the u.s.
scc
assets totaled $1.7billion at december31, 2002. see summary of significant accounting policies on page 31 for further details on scc.
share repurchases and dividends
during
2002, the company purchased 25.6million shares of mcdonald's stock for approximately $687million, of which 20.1million shares for $536million were under a new
$5.0billion share repurchase program.
during
2001 and 2000, the company sold 12.2million and 16.8million common equity put options, respectively, in connection with its share repurchase program. premiums
received were recorded in shareholders' equity as a reduction of the cost of treasury stock purchased and were $32million
in
2001 and $56million in 2000. in 2002, 10.1million common equity put options were exercised and 2.1million options expired unexercised, while 21.0million options were
exercised in 2001. the total amount paid to acquire these shares as a result of the options being exercised was $286million in 2002 and $700million in 2001. at december31,
2002, there were no common equity put options outstanding. at december31, 2001, the $350million total exercise price of outstanding options was classified in common equity put options
and forward contracts in the consolidated balance sheet, and the related offset was recorded in common stock in treasury, net of premiums received.
during
2001, the company also entered into equity forward contracts in connection with its share repurchase program. at december31, 2001, the $151million total purchase
price of the forward contracts was classified in common equity put options and forward contracts in the consolidated balance sheet, and the related offset was recorded in common stock in treasury. the
forward contracts for 5.5million shares settled in march2002, and there were no additional forward contracts outstanding at december31, 2002.

company has paid dividends on common stock for 27 consecutive years and has increased the dividend amount every year. additional dividend increases will be considered after reviewing
returns to shareholders, profitability expectations, financing needs and tax treatment of dividends. cash dividends are declared and paid on an annual basis. as in the past, future dividends will be
declared at the discretion of the board of directors.
financial position and capital resources
total assets and returns
total
assets grew by $1.4billion or 6% in 2002 and $851million or 4% in 2001. changes in foreign currency exchange rates increased total assets by approximately $785million in
2002 and decreased total assets by approximately $765million in 2001. at year-end 2002 and 2001, approximately 65% of consolidated assets was located in the major markets excluding
japan. net property and equipment rose $1.3billion in 2002 and represented 78% of total assets at year end.
operating
income is used to compute return on average assets, while income before cumulative effect of accounting change is used to calculate return on average common equity.
month-end balances are used to compute both average assets and average common equity.

return on average assets and return on average common equity both declined in 2002 and 2001, primarily due to weak operating results in apmea and latin america.
during 2003, the company will continue to concentrate mcdonald's restaurant openings in markets with acceptable returns and will significantly reduce the amount of capital we invest in apmea and latin
america, where returns have been pressured in recent years by weak economies.
financings and market risk
the
company generally borrows on a long-term basis and is exposed to the impact of interest-rate changes and foreign currency fluctuations. debt obligations at
december31, 2002 totaled $10.0billion compared with $8.9billion at december31, 2001. the increase in 2002 was due to the impact of changes in exchange rates on foreign
currency-denominated debt ($645million), sfas no.133 noncash fair value adjustments ($271million), and an increase in net borrowings ($145million).

moody's, standard& poor's and fitch currently rate mcdonald's commercial paper p-1, a-1 and f1 and its long-term debt
a2, a+ and a, respectively. the company has not historically experienced difficulty in obtaining financing or refinancing existing debt. certain of the company's debt obligations contain
cross-acceleration provisions and restrictions on company and subsidiary mortgages and the long-term debt of certain subsidiaries. in addition, the company is required to maintain a
minimum net worth (defined as consolidated assets less consolidated liabilities) of $5billion to comply with its line of credit agreements. there are no provisions in the company's debt
obligations that would accelerate repayment of debt as a result of a change in credit ratings. the company has $1.3billion available under committed line of credit agreements (see debt
financing note on page 35)as well as $1.8billion under a u.s. shelf registration and $700million under a euro medium-term notes program for future debt issuance.
the
company uses major capital markets, bank financings and derivatives to meet its financing requirements and reduce interest expense. the company manages its debt portfolio in response
to changes in interest rates and foreign currency rates by periodically retiring, redeeming and repurchasing debt, terminating exchange agreements and using derivatives.
the
company does not use derivatives with a level of complexity or with a risk higher than the exposures to be hedged and does not hold or issue derivatives for trading purposes. all exchange
agreements are over-the-counter instruments.
in
december2002, the company terminated certain interest-rate exchange agreements to effectively create fixed-rate financing for $1.8billion of
debt at interest rates that were near all-time low yields, and to reduce the potential exposure in the company's future interest expense due to a rise in interest rates.
in
managing the impact of interest-rate changes and foreign currency fluctuations, the company uses interest-rate exchange agreements and finances in the
currencies in which assets are denominated. all derivatives were recorded at fair value in the company's consolidated balance sheet at december31, 2002 as follows: miscellaneous other
assets$134million; other long-term liabilities (excluding interest)$39million; and accrued payroll and other
liabilities$24million. see summary of significant
accounting policies related to financial instruments on page 29 for additional information regarding their use and the impact of sfas no.133 regarding derivatives.
the
company uses foreign currency debt and derivatives to hedge certain foreign currency royalties, intercompany financings and long-term investments in foreign subsidiaries
and affiliates. this reduces the impact of fluctuating foreign currencies on cash flows and shareholders' equity. total foreign currency denominated debt, including the effects of foreign currency
exchange agreements, was $6.2billion and $5.0billion at year-end 2002 and 2001, respectively.
the
company does not have significant exposure to any individual counterparty and has master agreements that contain netting arrangements. certain of these agreements also require each
party to post collateral if credit ratings fall below, or aggregate exposures exceed, certain contractual limits. during 2002, certain counterparties were required to post collateral as aggregate
exposures exceeded certain contractual limits due to increased values. at december31, 2002, collateral in the amount of $2.2million was posted by a counterparty while the company was
not required to collateralize any of its obligations.
the
company actively hedges selected currencies to minimize the cash exposure of foreign currency royalty and other payments received in the u.s. in addition, where practical, mcdonald's
restaurants purchase goods and services in local currencies resulting in natural hedges, and the company typically finances in local currencies, creating economic hedges.
the
company's net asset exposure is diversified among a broad basket of currencies. at year-end 2002 and 2001, assets in hyperinflationary markets were principally financed
in u.s. dollars. the company's largest net asset exposures (defined as foreign currency assets less foreign currency liabilities) at year end were as follows:

the
company prepared sensitivity analyses of its financial instruments to determine the impact of hypothetical changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates on the
company's results of operations, cash flows and the fair value of its financial instruments. the interest-rate analysis assumed a one percentage point adverse change in interest rates on
all financial instruments but did not consider the effects of the reduced level of economic activity that could exist in such an environment. the foreign currency rate analysis assumed that each
foreign currency rate would change by 10% in the same direction relative to the u.s. dollar on all financial instruments; however, the analysis did not include the potential impact on sales levels or
local currency prices or the effect of fluctuating currencies on the company's anticipated foreign currency royalties and other payments received in the u.s. based on the results of these analyses of
the company's financial instruments, neither a one
percentage point adverse change in interest rates from 2002 levels nor a 10% adverse change in foreign currency rates from 2002 levels would materially affect the company's results of operations, cash
flows or the fair value of its financial instruments.
contractual obligations and commitments
the
company has long-term contractual obligations primarily in the form of lease obligations (related to both company-operated and franchised restaurants) and debt obligations. in
addition, the company has long-term revenue and cash flow streams that relate to its franchise arrangements. cash provided by operations (including cash provided by these franchise
arrangements) along with our borrowing capacity and other sources of cash will be used to satisfy the obligations. the following table summarizes the company's contractual obligations and their
aggregate maturities as well as future minimum rent payments due to the company under existing franchise arrangements as of december31, 2002. (see discussions of cash flows, financial position
and capital resources as well as the notes to the december31, 2002 consolidated financial statements for further details.)

adjustments.
in addition to long-term obligations, the company had guaranteed certain affiliate and other loans totaling $102million at december31,
2002.
outlook for 2003
the
company's strategies for 2003 are designed to reverse the negative comparable sales trend through a heightened focus on restaurant-level execution and
marketing. the company's outlook remains cautious until we see improved performance in our major markets. as a guideline, generally one percentage point of comparable sales in the u.s. impacts annual
earnings per share by 1.5 cents and one percentage point of comparable sales in europe impacts annual earnings per share by about 1 cent, assuming no change in profit margins. the
company expects the total amount of selling, general& administrative expenses in 2003 to be relatively flat in constant currencies compared with
2002. a
significant part of mcdonald's operating income is from outside the u.s. and more than 60% of total debt is denominated in foreign currencies. the euro and
the british pound are the most significant currencies impacting our business. if the euro and the british pound move 10% (compared with 2002 average rates), mcdonald's annual reported earnings per
share would change by about 4 cents to 5 cents. the
company expects to decrease its debt level in 2003, excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rates. the
company expects its 2003 effective income tax rate to be in the range of 33.5% to 34.5%. the
company is currently reviewing its previously announced plans for capital expenditures and restaurant openings for 2003 and expects to reduce both its
capital expenditures and restaurant openings compared with 2002. the plans are expected to be finalized and communicated in early april.
other matters
critical accounting policies and estimates
management's
discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company's consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with
accounting principles generally accepted in the u.s. the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets,
liabilities, revenues and expenses as well as related disclosures. on an ongoing basis, the company evaluates its estimates and judgments based on historical experience and various other factors that
are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
the
company annually reviews its financial reporting and disclosure practices and accounting policies to ensure that they provide accurate and transparent information relative to the
current economic and business environment. the company
believes that of its significant accounting policies the following involve a higher degree of judgment and/or complexity. (see summary of significant accounting policies more fully described on pages
28 through 32.)
property and equipment
property and equipment are depreciated or amortized on a straight-line basis over their useful lives based on management's estimates of the period over which the
assets will generate revenue. the useful lives are estimated based on historical experience with similar assets, taking into account anticipated technological or other changes. the company
periodically reviews these lives relative to physical factors, economic factors and industry trends. if there are changes in the planned use of property and equipment or if technological changes were
to occur more rapidly than anticipated, the useful lives assigned to these assets may need to be shortened, resulting in the recognition of increased depreciation and amortization expense in future
periods.
long-lived assets
long-lived assets (including goodwill) are reviewed for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an
asset may not be recoverable. in assessing the recoverability of the company's long-lived assets, the company considers changes in economic conditions and makes assumptions regarding
estimated future cash flows and other factors. estimates of future cash flows are judgments based on the company's experience and knowledge of operations. these estimates can be significantly impacted
by many factors including changes in global and local business and economic conditions, operating costs, inflation, competition, and consumer and demographic trends. if the company's estimates or the
underlying assumptions change in the future, the company may be required to record impairment charges.
restructuring and litigation accruals
in 2002 and 2001, the company recorded charges related to restructuring markets, eliminating positions and strategic changes. the accruals recorded included estimates pertaining
to employee termination costs and remaining lease obligations for closed facilities. although the company does not anticipate significant changes, the actual costs may differ from these estimates.
from
time to time, the company is subject to proceedings, lawsuits and other claims related to franchisees, suppliers, employees, customers and competitors. the company is required to
assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses. a determination of the amount of accrual required, if any, for these
contingencies is made after careful analysis of each matter. the required accrual may change in the future due to new developments in each matter or changes in approach such as a change in settlement
strategy in dealing with these matters. the company does not believe that any such matter will have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations.
income taxes
the company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred assets will not be realized.
while the company has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance, if these estimates and assumptions change in
the future, the company may be required to adjust its valuation allowance. this could result in a charge to, or an increase in, income in the period such determination is made.
deferred
u.s. income taxes have not been recorded for basis differences totaling $3.2billion related to investments in certain foreign subsidiaries or affiliates. the basis
differences consist primarily of undistributed earnings considered permanently invested in the businesses. if management's intentions change in the future, deferred taxes may need to be provided.
in
addition, the company operates within multiple taxing jurisdictions and is subject to audit in these jurisdictions. the company records accruals for the estimated outcomes of these
audits, and the accruals may change in the future due to new developments in each matter.
new accounting standards
asset retirement obligations
in june2001, the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no.143, accounting for asset retirement
obligations, effective january1, 2003. the statement requires legal obligations associated with the retirement of long-lived assets to be recognized at their
fair value at the time that the obligations are incurred. upon initial recognition of a liability, the cost will be capitalized as part of the related long-lived asset and allocated to
expense over the useful life of the asset.
application
of the new rules, which for the company relates to lease obligations in certain international markets, is expected to result in a cumulative effect of adoption in the first
quarter 2003 that will reduce net income and shareholders' equity by approximately $30million to $40million. the adoption of the new rules is not expected to have a material effect on
the company's ongoing results of operations or financial position.
variable interest entities
in january2003, the financial accounting standards board issued fasb interpretation no.46 (fin no.46), consolidation of variable
interest entities, which requires an enterprise to consolidate or make certain disclosures about variable interest entities that meet certain criteria, effective july1,
2003. the company is currently performing an analysis to determine the applicability of fin no.46 to scc. see summary of significant accounting policies on page 31 for further details.
effects of changing pricesinflation
the company has demonstrated an ability to manage inflationary cost increases effectively. this is because of rapid inventory turnover, the ability to adjust menu prices, cost
controls and substantial property holdingsmany of which are at fixed costs and partly financed by debt made less expensive by inflation. in hyperinflationary markets, menu board prices
typically are adjusted to keep pace with inflation, mitigating the effect on reported results.
forward-looking statements
certain forward-looking statements are included in this report. they use such words as "may," "will," "expect," "believe," "plan" and other similar terminology. these statements
reflect management's current expectations regarding future events and operating performance and speak only as of the date of this report. these forward-looking statements involve a number of risks and
uncertainties. the following are some of the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in or underlying our forward-looking statements: effectiveness of
operating initiatives; success in advertising and promotional efforts; changes in global and local business and economic conditions, including their impact on consumer confidence; fluctuations in
currency exchange and interest rates; food, labor and other operating costs; political or economic instability in local markets, including the effects of war and terrorist activities; competition,
including pricing and marketing initiatives and new product offerings by the company's competitors; consumer preferences or perceptions concerning the company's product offerings; spending patterns
and demographic trends; availability of qualified restaurant personnel; severe weather conditions; existence of positive or negative publicity regarding the company or its industry generally; effects
of legal claims; cost and deployment of capital; changes in future effective tax rates; changes in governmental regulations; and changes in applicable accounting policies and practices. the foregoing
list of important factors is not all inclusive.
the
company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.

notes to consolidated financial statements
summary of significant accounting policies
nature of business
the
company operates in the food service industry and primarily operates and franchises quick-service restaurant businesses under the mcdonald's brand. the company also operates other restaurant
concepts under its partner brands: boston market, chipotle mexican grill and donatos pizzeria. in addition, mcdonald's has a minority ownership in pret a manger. in march2002, the company sold
its aroma caf business in the u.k.
all
restaurants are operated by the company, or under the terms of franchise arrangements, by franchisees who are independent entrepreneurs or by affiliates operating under joint-venture
agreements between the company and local business people.
consolidation
the
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the company and its subsidiaries. substantially all investments in affiliates owned 50% or less (primarily mcdonald's japan and pret a
manger) are accounted for by the equity method.
estimates in financial statements
the
preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the u.s. requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported
in the financial statements and accompanying notes. actual results could differ from those estimates.
revenue recognition
sales
by company-operated restaurants are recognized on a cash basis. revenues from franchised and affiliated restaurants include continuing rent and service fees, initial fees and royalties received
from foreign affiliates and developmental licensees. continuing fees and royalties are recognized in the period earned. initial fees are recognized upon opening of a restaurant, which is when the
company has performed substantially all initial services required by the franchise arrangement.
foreign currency translation
the
functional currency of substantially all operations outside the u.s. is the respective local currency, except for a small number of countries with hyperinflationary economies, where the functional
currency is the u.s. dollar.
advertising costs
production
costs for radio and television advertising, primarily in the u.s., are expensed when the commercials are initially aired. advertising expenses included in costs of company-operated
restaurants and in selling, general& administrative expenses were (in millions): 2002$647.6; 2001$600.9; 2000$595.3. in addition, significant advertising
expenses are incurred by franchisees through advertising cooperatives in individual markets.
stock-based compensation
the
company accounts for stock options as prescribed by accounting principles board opinion no.25 and discloses pro forma information, as provided by statement of financial accounting
standards (sfas) no.123, accounting for stock-based compensation.
pro
forma net income and net income per common share were determined as if the company had accounted for its employee stock options under the fair value method of sfas no.123.
the fair value of these options was estimated at the date of grant using an option pricing model. the model was designed to estimate the fair value of exchange-traded options that, unlike employee
stock options, can be traded at any time and are fully transferable. in addition, such models require the input of highly subjective assumptions including the expected volatility of the stock price.
for pro forma disclosures, the options' estimated fair value was amortized over their vesting period. the following tables present the pro forma disclosures and the weighted-average assumptions used
to estimate the fair value of these options.

property and equipment
property
and equipment are stated at cost, with depreciation and amortization provided using the straight-line method over the following estimated useful lives: buildingsup to
40years; leasehold improvementsthe lesser of useful lives of assets or lease terms including option periods; and equipmentthree to 12years.
goodwill
goodwill
represents the excess of cost over the net tangible assets of acquired restaurant businesses. in june2001, the financial accounting standards board (fasb) issued sfas no.141,  business combinations, and no.142, goodwill and other intangible assets. sfas no.141
requires that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations initiated after june30, 2001 and includes guidance on the initial recognition and measurement of goodwill
and other intangible assets arising from business combinations. sfas no.142, effective january1, 2002, eliminates the amortization of goodwill (and intangible assets deemed to have
indefinite lives) and instead subjects it to annual impairment tests. other intangible assets continue to be amortized over their useful lives. application of the nonamortization provisions of sfas
no.142 in 2001 and 2000 would have increased net income by approximately $30million ($0.02 per share) in each year.
the
company's goodwill primarily consists of amounts paid in excess of net tangible assets for (1)purchases of mcdonald's restaurants from franchisees, (2)ownership
percentage increases in international joint-ventures and (3)acquisitions of other businesses such as partner brands. under sfas no.142, goodwill is generally assigned to the reporting
units that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. the company has defined reporting units as each individual country for mcdonald's restaurant business as well as each
individual partner brand.
the
annual goodwill impairment test compares the fair value of a reporting unit, generally based on discounted cash flows, with its carrying amount including goodwill. if the carrying
amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is measured as the difference between the fair value of reporting unit goodwill and the carrying amount of goodwill.
the
company performed the initial required goodwill impairment test as of january1, 2002 and recorded a noncash pretax charge of $116.2million ($98.6million after
tax or $0.07 per diluted share) for the cumulative effect of this accounting change. the impaired goodwill resulted primarily from businesses in argentina, uruguay and other markets in latin america
and the middle east, where economies have weakened significantly in recent years. in addition, the company completed its annual impairment testing of goodwill in the fourth quarter of 2002, which
resulted in no significant charges.
the
carrying amount of goodwill totaled $1,559.8million and $1,320.4million as of december31, 2002 and 2001, respectively (u.s.$676.3, $516.7;
europe$353.5, $278.6; asia/pacific, middle east and africa (apmea)$211.0, $171.3; latin america$97.3, $158.5; canada$77.5, $51.2; and partner
brands$144.2, $144.1). the changes in carrying amounts of goodwill from december31, 2001 to december31, 2002 were due to (1)the charge of $116.2million for
the cumulative effect of the accounting change, (2)goodwill generated in 2002 as a result of purchases of mcdonald's restaurant businesses and (3)foreign currency rate fluctuations.
long-lived assets
in
accordance with sfas no.144, accounting for the impairment or disposal of long-lived assets, long-lived assets are
reviewed for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. for purposes of annually reviewing mcdonald's
restaurant assets for potential impairment, assets are initially grouped together at a television market level in the u.s. and at a country level for each of the international markets. for partner
brands, assets are grouped by each individual brand. if an indicator of impairment (e.g., negative operating cash flows for the most recent trailing twelve-month period) exists for any grouping of
assets, an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows produced by each restaurant within the asset grouping is compared to its carrying value. if an asset is determined to be impaired, the loss is
measured by the excess of the carrying amount of the asset over its fair value as determined by an estimate of discounted future cash flows.
losses
on assets held for disposal are recognized when management has approved and committed to a plan to dispose of the assets, and the assets are available for disposal. generally,
such losses relate to either restaurants that have closed and ceased operations or businesses or restaurants that are available for sale.
financial instruments
the
company generally borrows on a long-term basis and is exposed to the impact of interest-rate changes and foreign currency fluctuations. the company uses foreign currency
denominated debt and derivative instruments to manage the impact of these changes. the company does not use derivatives with a level of complexity or with a risk higher than the exposures to be hedged
and does not hold or issue derivatives for trading purposes.
the
counterparties to these agreements consist of a diverse group of financial institutions. the company continually monitors its positions and the credit ratings of its counterparties,
and adjusts positions as appropriate. the company did not have significant exposure to any individual counterparty at december31, 2002 and has master agreements that contain netting
arrangements. certain of these agreements also require each party to post collateral if credit ratings fall below, or aggregate exposures exceed, certain contractual limits. during 2002, certain
counterparties were required to post collateral as aggregate exposures exceeded certain contractual limits due to increased values. at december31, 2002, collateral in the amount of
$2.2million was posted by a counterparty while the company was not required to collateralize any of its obligations.
effective
january1, 2001, the company adopted sfas no.133, accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities, as
amended. sfas no.133 requires companies to recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the balance sheet at fair value. sfas no.133 also requires companies to
designate all derivatives that qualify as hedging instruments
as
either fair value hedges, cash flow hedges or hedges of net investments in foreign operations. this designation is based upon the exposure being hedged.
the
company recorded a transition adjustment at january1, 2001 related to cash flow hedges, which reduced accumulated other comprehensive income in shareholders' equity by
$17.0million, after tax. this adjustment was primarily related to interest-rate exchange agreements used to lock in long-term borrowing rates. the cumulative effect of
adopting sfas no.133 at january1, 2001 was not material to the company's consolidated statement of income.
all
derivatives, primarily interest-rate exchange agreements and foreign currency exchange agreements, were classified in the company's consolidated balance sheet at
december31, 2002 as follows: miscellaneous other assets$133.9million; other long-term liabilities (excluding accrued
interest)$39.2million; and accrued payroll and other liabilities$23.8million.
fair value hedges
the company enters into fair value hedges to reduce the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset or a liability, or an identified portion thereof, which is attributable
to a particular risk. the types of fair value hedges the company enters into include: (1)interest-rate exchange agreements to convert a portion of its fixed-rate debt
to floating-rate debt and (2)foreign currency exchange agreements for the exchange of various currencies and interest rates. the foreign currency exchange agreements are entered
into to hedge the currency risk associated with debt and intercompany loans denominated in foreign currencies, and essentially result in floating-rate assets or liabilities denominated in
u.s. dollars or appropriate functional currencies.
for
fair value hedges, the gains or losses on derivatives as well as the offsetting gains or losses on the related hedged items are recognized in current earnings. during the years ended
december31, 2002 and 2001, there was no significant impact to the company's earnings related to the ineffective portion of fair value hedging instruments.
cash flow hedges
the company enters into cash flow hedges to mitigate the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows attributable to a particular risk. the types of cash flow hedges
the company enters into include: (1)interest-rate exchange agreements that effectively convert a portion of floating-rate debt to fixed-rate debt and are
designed to reduce the impact of interest-rate changes on future interest expense, (2)forward foreign exchange contracts and foreign currency options that are designed to protect
against the reduction in value of forecasted foreign currency cash flows such as royalties and other payments denominated in foreign currencies, and (3)foreign currency exchange agreements for
the exchange of various currencies and interest rates. the foreign currency exchange agreements hedge the currency risk associated with debt and intercompany loans denominated in foreign currencies,
and essentially result in fixed-rate assets or liabilities denominated in u.s. dollars or appropriate functional currencies.
for
cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the gains or losses on derivatives is reported in the deferred hedging adjustment component of accumulated other comprehensive income in
shareholders' equity and reclassified into earnings in the same
period or periods in which the hedged transaction affects earnings. the remaining gain or loss in excess of the cumulative change in the present value of future cash flows of the hedged item, if any,
is recognized in earnings during the period of change. during the years ended december31, 2002 and 2001, there was no significant impact to the company's earnings related to the ineffective
portion of cash flow hedging instruments.
the
company recorded net increases to the deferred hedging adjustment component of accumulated other comprehensive income in shareholders' equity of $0.8million and
$7.7million, after tax, related to cash flow hedges during the years ended december31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. based on interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates at
december31, 2002, no significant amount of deferred hedging adjustments, after tax, included in accumulated other comprehensive income in shareholders' equity at december31, 2002 will
be recognized in earnings in 2003 as the underlying hedged transactions are realized. the maximum maturity date of any cash flow hedge of forecasted transactions at december31, 2002 was
12months, excluding instruments hedging forecasted payments of variable interest on existing financial instruments that have various maturity dates through 2011.
hedges of net investments in foreign operations
the company uses forward foreign exchange contracts and foreign currency denominated debt to hedge its investments in certain foreign subsidiaries and affiliates. realized and
unrealized translation adjustments from these hedges are included in shareholders' equity in the foreign currency translation component of accumulated other comprehensive income and offset translation
adjustments on the underlying net assets of foreign subsidiaries and affiliates, which also are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income.
during
the year ended december31, 2002, the company recorded a net decrease in translation adjustments in accumulated other comprehensive income of $312.0million after
tax (included in the net increase of $106.7million of translation adjustments in the consolidated statement of shareholders' equity) related primarily to foreign currency denominated debt
designated as hedges of net investments. during the year ended december31, 2001, the company recorded a net increase in translation adjustments in accumulated other comprehensive income of
$168.5million after tax related to hedges of net investments.
variable interest entities
in
january2003, the fasb issued interpretation no.46 (fin no. 46), consolidation of variable interest entities, which requires an
enterprise to consolidate or make certain disclosures about variable interest entities that meet certain criteria, effective july1, 2003. if it is reasonably possible that an enterprise will
consolidate or disclose information about a variable interest entity on the effective date, the interpretation requires certain information to be disclosed as of december31, 2002.
the
company and six unaffiliated companies that supply the "mcdonald's system" (mcdonald's franchisees, suppliers and the company) are equal owners of system capital corporation (scc).
the company is currently performing an analysis to determine the applicability of fin no. 46 to scc. scc's purpose is to provide funding to mcdonald's franchisees, suppliers to the mcdonald's system
and mcdonald's corporation and to build equity within scc that will benefit the mcdonald's system. no employees of scc are employees of the seven shareholders. scc competes with other lenders who
provide similar financing to mcdonald's franchisees and suppliers. scc's function is similar to that of a cooperative and its primary operating activities include (1)providing loans to
qualifying u.s. franchisees to purchase existing restaurant businesses as well as finance equipment, buildings and working capital, (2)purchasing accounts receivable and financing inventory
and other needs of eligible suppliers and distributors and (3)acquiring land and leasing it to mcdonald's corporation for new restaurants, primarily in the u.s.
the
leases are generally for 20years, provide for up to 20 additional years in renewal options and include an option for the company to purchase some or all of the real estate
subject to the lease at a price equal to scc's acquisition cost. the company's commitments under these leases are included in operating lease commitments on pages 20 and 34 and total approximately
$14million annually based on scc's current cost of financing.
scc
funds its operations through borrowings by its wholly owned subsidiary, golden funding corp. (golden funding). golden funding had approximately $1.7billion of commercial
paper and medium-term notes outstanding at december31, 2002. scc assets included $900million of loans to mcdonald's franchisees, $500million of land leased to the
company, and $300million of loans to mcdonald's suppliers.
moody's,
standard& poor's and fitch periodically review golden funding, including reviews of key performance indicators and asset quality. these rating agencies currently rate
golden funding's commercial paper p-1, a-1 and f1 and its long-term debt aa2, aa and aa, respectively. credit support for golden funding's financing consists of:
$14million of cash reserves held by golden funding, $14million of preferred shares (primarily supplier trade receivables purchased by scc and contributed to golden funding), and a
$30million letter of credit issued jointly by a syndication of banks.
the
company's investment in scc is accounted for on the cost basis.
asset retirement obligations
in
june2001, the fasb issued sfas no.143, accounting for asset retirement obligations, effective january1, 2003. the statement
requires legal obligations associated with the retirement of long-lived assets to be recognized at their fair value at the time that the obligations are incurred. upon initial recognition
of a liability, the cost will be capitalized as part of the related long-lived asset and allocated to expense over the useful life of the asset.
application
of the new rules, which for the company relates to lease obligations in certain international markets, is expected to result in a cumulative effect of adoption in the first
quarter 2003 that will reduce net income and shareholders' equity by approximately $30million to $40million. the adoption of the new rules is not expected to have a material effect on
the company's ongoing results of operations or financial position.
common equity put options and forward contracts
during
2001 and 2000, the company sold 12.2million and 16.8million common equity put options, respectively, in connection with its share repurchase program. premiums received were
recorded in shareholders' equity as a reduction of the cost of treasury stock purchased and were $31.8million in 2001 and $56.0million in 2000. in 2002, 10.1million common
equity put options were exercised and 2.1million options expired unexercised, while 21.0million options were exercised in 2001. the total amount paid to acquire these shares as a
result of the options being exercised was $286million in 2002 and $700million in 2001. at december31, 2002, there were no common equity put options outstanding. at
december31, 2001, the $350.0million total exercise price of outstanding options was classified in common equity put options and forward contracts in the consolidated balance sheet, and
the related offset was recorded in common stock in treasury, net of premiums received.
during
2001, the company also entered into equity forward contracts in connection with its share repurchase program. at december31, 2001, the $150.8million total purchase
price of the forward contracts was classified in common equity put options and forward contracts in the consolidated balance sheet, and the related offset was recorded in common stock in treasury. the
forward contracts for 5.5million shares settled in march2002, and there were no forward contracts outstanding at december31, 2002.
sales of stock by subsidiaries and affiliates
as
permitted by staff accounting bulletin no.51 issued by the securities and exchange commission, when a subsidiary or affiliate sells unissued shares in a public offering, the company records
an adjustment to reflect an increase or decrease in the carrying value of its investment and a resulting nonoperating gain or loss.
per common share information
diluted
net income per common share is calculated using net income divided by diluted weighted-average shares. diluted weighted-average shares include weighted-average shares outstanding plus the
dilutive effect of stock options, calculated using the treasury stock method. the dilutive effect of stock options was (in millions of shares): 20028.4; 200119.6;
200033.3. stock options that were not included in diluted weighted-average shares because they would have been antidilutive were (in millions
of shares): 2002148.0; 200183.1; 200049.2. the dilutive effect of common equity put options and forward contracts in 2001 and 2000 was not significant.
statement of cash flows
the
company considers short-term, highly liquid investments to be cash equivalents. the impact of fluctuating foreign currencies on cash and equivalents was not material.

team service system payments
in
2002, the company made payments to u.s. owner/operators to facilitate the introduction of a new front counter team service system.
restructuring charges
in
2002, the company recorded $266.9million of pretax charges ($243.6million after tax) related to transferring ownership in four countries in the middle east and latin america,
ceasing operations in three countries in latin america, eliminating positions (approximately 600 positions, about half of which were in the u.s. and half of which were in international markets) and
reallocating resources and consolidating certain home office facilities to control costs.
the
2002 charges consisted of: $136.8million of asset write-offs and losses on the sale of assets and $64.6million of costs for leases and other obligations
in the markets restructured or exited, $55.9million of severance and other employee-related costs, $14.7million of lease cancellation and other costs related to the closing of certain
home office facilities; and $9.9million of payments made to facilitate a change of ownership from u.s. franchisees who have had a history of financial difficulty and consequently were unable
to deliver the level of operational excellence needed to succeed in the future. these charges were partially offset by a $15.0million reversal of accrued restructuring costs recorded in 2001,
primarily due to lower employee-related costs than originally estimated.
in
2001, the company recorded $200.0million of pretax charges ($136.1million after tax) related to strategic changes and restaurant initiatives in the u.s. and certain
international markets. the changes in the u.s. included streamlining operations by reducing the number of regions and divisions, enabling the company to combine staff functions. in connection with
these initiatives, the company eliminated approximately 850 positions, consisting of 700 positions in the u.s., primarily in the divisions and regions, and 150 positions in international markets.
the
2001 charges consisted of: $114.4million of severance and other employee-related costs, $68.8million of lease cancellation and other costs related to the closing of
region and division facilities, and $16.8million of other cash costs, primarily consisting of payments made to facilitate a change of ownership from u.s. franchisees who have had a history of
financial difficulty and consequently were unable to deliver the level of operational excellence needed to succeed in the future.
restaurant closings/asset impairment
in
2002, the company recorded $402.4million of pretax charges ($335.8million after tax) consisting of: $302.3million related to management's decision to close 751
underperforming restaurants (234 were closed in 2002 and 517 will close throughout 2003) primarily in the u.s. and japan, and $100.1million primarily related to the impairment of assets for
certain existing restaurants in europe and latin america.
in
2001, the company recorded $135.2million of pretax charges ($106.3million after tax) consisting of: $91.2million related to the closing of 163 underperforming
restaurants in international markets in 2001, a $24.0million asset impairment charge due to an assessment of the ongoing impact of turkey's significant currency devaluation on our business,
and $20.0million related to the disposition of aroma caf in the u.k.
technology write-offs and other charges
in
2002, the company recorded $183.9million of pretax charges ($120.5million after tax) consisting of: $170.0million primarily related to the write-off of software
development costs as a result of management's decision to terminate a long-term technology project, and $13.9million primarily related to the write-off of receivables
and inventory in venezuela as a result of the temporary closure of all mcdonald's restaurants due to the national strike that began in early december.
in
2001, the company recorded $42.4million of pretax charges ($29.1million after tax) consisting of: $17.4million primarily related to the write-off
of certain technology, and $25.0million primarily related to the unrecoverable costs incurred in connection with the theft of winning game pieces from the company's monopoly and certain other
promotional games over an extended period of time, and the related termination of the supplier of the game pieces. fifty individuals (none of whom were company employees) were convicted of conspiracy
and/or mail fraud charges.

employee severance is paid in installments over a period of up to one year after termination, and the remaining lease payments for closed facilities will generally be
paid through 2020. no significant adjustments have been made to the original plans approved by management.
mcdonald's japan initial public offering (ipo) gain
in 2001, mcdonald's japan, the company's largest market in the apmea segment, completed an ipo of 12million shares. the company owns 50% of mcdonald's japan, while the
company's founding partner den fujita and his family own approximately 26%. the company recorded a $137.1million gain (pre and after tax) in nonoperating income to reflect an increase in the
carrying value of its investment as a result of the cash proceeds from the ipo received by mcdonald's japan.
franchise arrangements
individual franchise arrangements generally include a lease and a license and provide for payment of initial fees, as well as continuing rent and service fees to the company
based upon a percent of sales with minimum rent payments. mcdonald's franchisees are granted the right to operate a restaurant using the mcdonald's system and, in certain cases, the use of a
restaurant facility, generally for a period of 20years. franchisees pay related occupancy costs including property taxes, insurance and maintenance. in addition, franchisees outside the u.s.
generally pay a refundable, noninterest-bearing security deposit. foreign affiliates and developmental licensees pay a royalty to the company based upon a percent of sales.
the
results of operations of restaurant businesses purchased and sold in transactions with franchisees, affiliates and others were not material to the consolidated financial statements
for periods prior to purchase and sale.

deferred u.s. income taxes have not been recorded for basis differences related to investments in certain foreign subsidiaries and affiliates.
these basis differences were approximately $3.2billion at december31, 2002 and consisted primarily of undistributed earnings considered permanently invested in the businesses.
determination of the deferred income tax liability on these unremitted earnings is not practicable because such liability, if any, is dependent on circumstances existing if and when remittance occurs.
leasing arrangements
at december31, 2002, the company was lessee at 6,871 restaurant locations through ground leases (the company leases the land and the company or franchisee owns the
building) and at 7,823 restaurant locations through improved leases (the company leases land and buildings). lease terms for most restaurants are generally for 20 to 25years and, in many
cases, provide for rent escalations and renewal options, with certain leases providing purchase options. for most locations, the company is obligated for the related occupancy costs including property
taxes, insurance and maintenance. in addition, the company is lessee under noncancelable leases covering certain offices and vehicles.

debt financing
line of credit agreements
at
december31, 2002, the company had several line of credit agreements with various banks totaling $1.3billion, all of which remained unused at year-end 2002. subsequent to
year end, the company renegotiated the line of credit agreements as follows: $810.0million of lines expiring in 2004 with a term of 364days and fees based on current credit ratings of
.05% per annum on the total commitment, with a feature that allows the company to convert the borrowings to a one-year loan at expiration; a $500.0million line expiring in 2008
with fees based on current credit ratings of .07% per annum on the total commitment; and a $25.0million line expiring in 2003 with a term of 364days and fees of .07% per annum on the
total commitment. fees and interest rates on these lines are based on the company's long-term credit rating assigned by moody's and standard& poor's. under terms of these
agreements, the company is required to maintain a minimum net worth (defined as consolidated assets less consolidated liabilities) of $5billion. in addition, certain subsidiaries outside the
u.s. had unused lines of credit totaling $1.1billion at december31, 2002; these were principally short-term and denominated in various currencies at local market rates of
interest.
the
weighted-average interest rate of short-term borrowings, consisting of commercial paper and foreign currency bank line borrowings, was 3.4% at both december31,
2002 and december31, 2001.
fair values
at
december31, 2002, the fair value of the company's debt and notes payable obligations was estimated at $10.5billion compared to a carrying amount of $10.0billion. this fair
value was estimated using various pricing models or discounted cash flow analyses that incorporated quoted market prices. the company has no current plans to retire a significant amount of its debt
prior to maturity.
the
carrying amounts for both cash and equivalents and notes receivable approximate fair value. foreign currency and interest-rate exchange agreements, foreign currency
options and forward foreign exchange contracts were recorded in the consolidated balance sheet at fair value using various pricing models or discounted cash flow analyses that incorporated quoted
market prices. no fair value was estimated for noninterest-bearing security deposits by franchisees, because these deposits are an integral part of the overall franchise arrangements.
esop loans and other guarantees
at
december31, 2002, the company has guaranteed and included in total debt $22.6million of notes issued by the leveraged employee stock ownership plan (esop) with payments through
2006. borrowings related to the esop at december31, 2002, which include $85.9million of loans from the company to the esop and the $22.6million of notes guaranteed by the
company, are reflected as long-term debt with a corresponding reduction of shareholders' equity (unearned esop compensation). the esop is repaying the loans and interest through 2018 using
company contributions and dividends from its mcdonald's common stock holdings. as the principal amount of the borrowings is repaid, the debt and the unearned esop compensation are being reduced.
the
company also has guaranteed certain affiliate and other loans totaling $102.0million at december31, 2002. these guarantees are contingent commitments issued by the
company generally to support borrowing arrangements of certain u.s. partnerships and franchisees, and certain affiliates. the terms of the guarantees vary and are equal to the remaining term of the
related debt. at december31, 2002, there was no carrying value for obligations under these guarantees in the company's consolidated balance sheet.
debt obligations
the
company has incurred debt obligations principally through public and private offerings and bank loans. there are no provisions in the company's debt obligations that would accelerate repayment of
debt as a result of a change in credit ratings. certain of the company's debt obligations contain cross-acceleration provisions and restrictions on company and subsidiary mortgages and the
long-term debt of certain subsidiaries. under certain agreements, the company has the option to retire debt prior to maturity, either at par or at a premium over par.
the
following table summarizes the company's debt obligations (the interest rates reflected in the table include the effects of interest-rate and foreign currency exchange
agreements).

(1)weighted-average effective rate, computed on a semiannual basis.
(2) includes $150million of debentures that mature in 2027, which are subordinated to senior debt and which provide for the ability to defer interest payments up to
five years
under certain conditions.
(3) a portion of u.s. dollar fixed-rate debt effectively has been converted into other currencies and/or into floating-rate debt through the use of exchange
agreements. the rates shown reflect the fixed rate on the receivable portion of the exchange agreements. all other obligations in this table reflect the net effects of these and other exchange
agreements.
(4) primarily consists of swiss francs, swedish kronor and danish kroner.
(5) primarily consists of korean won, chinese renminbi, new taiwanese dollars and hong kong dollars.
(6) aggregate maturities for 2002 debt balances, before fair value adjustments, are as follows: 2003$337.4; 2004$974.8; 2005$2,016.7;
2006$1,013.6; 2007$662.7; and thereafter$4,609.4. these amounts include reclassifications of short-term obligations to long-term
obligations of $810.0 in 2005 and $500.0 thereafter, as they are supported by the long-term line of credit agreements discussed on page35.
(7) sfas no.133 requires that the underlying items in fair value hedges, in this case debt obligations, be recorded at fair value. the related hedging instrument is
also recorded
at fair value in either miscellaneous other assets or other long-term liabilities. a portion ($155.9million) of the adjustments at december31, 2002 related to
interest-rate exchange agreements that were terminated in december2002 and will amortize as a reduction to interest expense over the remaining life of the related debt.
(8) includes notes payable, current maturities of long-term debt and long-term debt included in the consolidated balance sheet. the increase in debt obligations
from december31, 2001 to december31, 2002 was due to the impact of changes in exchange rates on foreign currency-denominated debt ($645.0million), sfas no.133 fair
value adjustments ($270.9million) and an increase in net borrowings ($145.5million).

the company's profit sharing and savings plan for u.s.-based employees includes profit sharing, 401(k) and leveraged employee stock ownership (esop) features. the 401(k) feature
allows participants to make pretax contributions that are partly matched from shares released under the esop. mcdonald's executives, staff and restaurant managers participate in additional esop
allocations and profit sharing contributions, based on their compensation. the profit sharing contribution is discretionary, and the company determines the amount each year.
participant
401(k) contributions, the company's matching contributions, profit sharing contributions and any related earnings can be invested in mcdonald's common stock or among several
other investment alternatives. esop allocations are generally invested in mcdonald's common stock.
in
addition, the company maintains a nonqualified, unfunded supplemental plan that allows participants to make tax-deferred contributions and receive company-provided
allocations that cannot be made under the profit sharing and savings plan because of internal revenue service limitations. the investment alternatives and returns in the supplemental plan are based on
certain of the investment alternatives under the profit sharing and savings plan. total liabilities under the supplemental plan were $297.3million at december31, 2002 and
$301.1million at december31, 2001 and were included in other long-term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet.
the
company has entered into derivative contracts to hedge changes in the supplemental plan liabilities. at december31, 2002, derivatives with a fair value of
$34.5million indexed to the company's stock and $38.4million indexed to certain market indices were included in miscellaneous other assets in the consolidated balance sheet. all
changes in plan liabilities and in the fair value of the derivatives are recorded in selling, general& administrative expenses. changes in fair value of the derivatives indexed to the
company's stock are recorded in the consolidated statement of income because the contracts provide the counterparty with a choice of cash settlement or settlement in shares.
total
u.s. costs for the profit sharing and savings plan, including nonqualified benefits and related hedging activities, were (in millions): 2002$50.1;
2001$54.6; 2000$49.6.
certain
subsidiaries outside the u.s. also offer profit sharing, stock purchase or other similar benefit plans. total plan costs outside the u.s. were (in millions):
2002$36.8; 2001$39.7; 2000$38.1.
other
postretirement benefits and postemployment benefits, excluding severance benefits related to the 2002 and 2001 restructuring charges, were immaterial.
stock options
at december31, 2002, the company had five stock-based compensation plans for employees and nonemployee directors. options to purchase common stock are granted at the
fair market value of the stock on the date of grant. therefore, no compensation cost has been recognized in the consolidated statement of income for these plans.
substantially
all of the options become exercisable in four equal installments, beginning a year from the date of the grant, and expire 10years from the grant date. in 2001, the
board of directors approved a three-year extension to the term of 44.2million options granted between may1, 1999 and december31, 2000 with an exercise price greater
than $28.90. because the market value of the stock was less than the exercise price of the options at the time of extension, no compensation expense was required to be recorded.
also
in 2001, the board of directors approved a special grant of 11.9million options at a price of $28.90 as an incentive to meet an operating income performance goal for
calendar year 2003. the options vest on january31, 2004, and if the performance goal is met, the options will retain their original 10-year term; otherwise, they will expire on
june30, 2004. the company does not expect to meet this performance goal.
at
december31, 2002, the number of shares of common stock reserved for issuance under the plans was 231.9million, including 33.0million available for future
grants. a summary of the status of the company's plans as of december31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, and changes during the years then ended, is presented in the following table.

management's report
management is responsible for the preparation, integrity and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements and notes to the consolidated financial statements. the
financial statements were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the u.s. and include certain amounts based on management's judgment and best estimates. other
financial information presented is consistent with the financial statements.
the
company maintains a system of internal controls over financial reporting including safeguarding of assets against unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition, which is designed to
provide reasonable assurance to the company's management and board of directors regarding the preparation of reliable published financial statements and asset safeguarding. the system includes a
documented organizational structure and appropriate division of responsibilities; established policies and procedures that are communicated throughout the company; careful selection, training, and
development of our people; and utilization of an internal audit program. policies and procedures prescribe that the company and all employees are to maintain high standards of proper business
practices throughout the world.
there
are inherent limitations to the effectiveness of any system of internal control, including the possibility of human error and the circumvention or overriding of controls.
accordingly, even an effective internal control system can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and safeguarding of assets. furthermore, the effectiveness
of an internal control system can change with circumstances. the company believes that it maintains an effective system of internal control over financial reporting and safeguarding of assets against
unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition.
the
consolidated financial statements have been audited by independent auditors, ernst& young llp, who were given unrestricted access to all financial records and related data.
the audit report of ernst& young llp is presented herein.
the
board of directors, operating through its audit committee composed entirely of independent directors, provides oversight to the financial reporting process. ernst& young llp
has unrestricted access to the audit committee and regularly meets with the committee to discuss accounting, auditing and financial reporting matters.

have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of mcdonald's corporation as of december31, 2002 and 2001, and the related consolidated statements of income, shareholders' equity
and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended december31, 2002. these financial statements are the responsibility of mcdonald's corporation management. our responsibility is
to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.
we
conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the u.s. those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance
about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. an audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. an
audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. we believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
in
our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of mcdonald's corporation at december31,
2002 and 2001, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended december31, 2002, in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the u.s.
