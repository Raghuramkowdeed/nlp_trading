ITEM 1. BUSINESS

MCDONALDS CORPORATION, THE REGISTRANT, TOGETHER WITH ITS SUBSIDIARIES, IS REFERRED TO HEREIN AS THE COMPANY.

(A) GENERAL DEVELOPMENT OF BUSINESS

DURING 2003, THERE HAVE BEEN NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGES TO THE COMPANYS CORPORATE

STRUCTURE OR MATERIAL CHANGES IN THE COMPANYS METHOD OF CONDUCTING BUSINESS.

(B) FINANCIAL INFORMATION ABOUT SEGMENTS

SEGMENT DATA FOR THE YEARS

(C) NARRATIVE DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS

GENERAL

THE COMPANY PRIMARILY OPERATES AND FRANCHISES

MCDONALDS RESTAURANTS IN THE FOOD SERVICE INDUSTRY. THESE RESTAURANTS SERVE A VARIED, YET LIMITED, VALUE-PRICED MENU (SEE PRODUCTS) IN MORE THAN 100 COUNTRIES AROUND THE WORLD.

THE COMPANY ALSO OPERATES BOSTON MARKET AND CHIPOTLE MEXICAN GRILL IN THE U.S. AND HAS A MINORITY OWNERSHIP INTEREST IN

U.K.-BASED PRET A MANGER. IN DECEMBER 2003, THE COMPANY SOLD ITS DONATOS PIZZERIA BUSINESS.

SINCE MCDONALDS RESTAURANT BUSINESS COMPRISES VIRTUALLY ALL OF THE COMPANYS CONSOLIDATED OPERATING RESULTS, THIS NARRATIVE PRIMARILY RELATES TO THAT BUSINESS, UNLESS OTHERWISE NOTED.

ALL RESTAURANTS ARE OPERATED EITHER BY THE COMPANY, BY INDEPENDENT

ENTREPRENEURS UNDER THE TERMS OF FRANCHISE ARRANGEMENTS (FRANCHISEES), OR BY AFFILIATES OPERATING UNDER LICENSE AGREEMENTS.

THE COMPANYS OPERATIONS ARE DESIGNED TO ASSURE CONSISTENCY AND HIGH QUALITY AT EVERY MCDONALDS RESTAURANT. WHEN GRANTING FRANCHISES AND

FORMING JOINT-VENTURES, THE COMPANY IS SELECTIVE AND IS NOT IN THE PRACTICE OF FRANCHISING TO OR PARTNERING WITH INVESTOR GROUPS OR PASSIVE INVESTORS.

UNDER THE CONVENTIONAL FRANCHISE ARRANGEMENT, FRANCHISEES PROVIDE CAPITAL BY INITIALLY INVESTING IN THE EQUIPMENT, SIGNS, SEATING AND DÉCOR OF

THEIR RESTAURANT BUSINESSES, AND BY REINVESTING IN THE BUSINESS OVER TIME. THE COMPANY GENERALLY SHARES THE INVESTMENT BY OWNING OR LEASING THE LAND AND BUILDING. FRANCHISEES CONTRIBUTE TO THE COMPANYS REVENUE STREAM THROUGH PAYMENT OF RENT

AND SERVICE FEES BASED UPON A PERCENT OF SALES, WITH SPECIFIED MINIMUM RENT PAYMENTS, ALONG WITH INITIAL FEES. THE CONVENTIONAL FRANCHISE ARRANGEMENT TYPICALLY LASTS 20 YEARS AND FRANCHISING PRACTICES ARE GENERALLY CONSISTENT THROUGHOUT THE WORLD. A

DISCUSSION REGARDING SITE SELECTION IS INCLUDED IN PART I, ITEM 2, PAGE 5 OF THIS FORM 10-K.

THE COMPANY, ITS FRANCHISEES AND AFFILIATES PURCHASE FOOD, PACKAGING, EQUIPMENT AND OTHER GOODS FROM NUMEROUS INDEPENDENT SUPPLIERS THAT HAVE BEEN APPROVED BY THE COMPANY. THE COMPANY HAS ESTABLISHED AND STRICTLY

ENFORCES HIGH-QUALITY STANDARDS. THE COMPANY HAS QUALITY ASSURANCE LABS AROUND THE WORLD TO ENSURE THAT OUR HIGH STANDARDS ARE CONSISTENTLY MET. THE QUALITY ASSURANCE PROCESS NOT ONLY INVOLVES ONGOING PRODUCT REVIEWS, BUT ALSO ON-SITE INSPECTIONS OF

SUPPLIERS FACILITIES. FURTHER, A QUALITY ASSURANCE BOARD, COMPOSED OF THE COMPANYS TECHNICAL, SAFETY AND SUPPLY CHAIN SPECIALISTS, PROVIDES STRATEGIC GLOBAL LEADERSHIP FOR ALL ASPECTS OF FOOD QUALITY AND SAFETY. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY

WORKS CLOSELY WITH SUPPLIERS TO ENCOURAGE INNOVATION, ASSURE BEST PRACTICES AND DRIVE CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT.

INDEPENDENTLY OWNED AND OPERATED DISTRIBUTION CENTERS, ALSO APPROVED BY THE COMPANY, DISTRIBUTE PRODUCTS AND SUPPLIES TO MOST MCDONALDS RESTAURANTS.

IN ADDITION, RESTAURANT PERSONNEL ARE TRAINED IN THE PROPER STORAGE, HANDLING AND PREPARATION OF OUR PRODUCTS AND IN THE DELIVERY OF CUSTOMER SERVICE.

MCDONALDS GLOBAL BRAND IS WELL KNOWN. MARKETING, PROMOTIONAL AND PUBLIC RELATIONS ACTIVITIES ARE DESIGNED TO NURTURE MCDONALDS BRAND IMAGE AND

DIFFERENTIATE THE COMPANY FROM COMPETITORS. MARKETING AND PROMOTIONAL EFFORTS FOCUS ON VALUE, FOOD TASTE AND THE CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY IS FOCUSED ON BEING A LEADER IN SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY, AS THE COMPANY BELIEVES IT IS

IMPORTANT TO GIVE BACK TO THE PEOPLE AND COMMUNITIES AROUND THE WORLD WHO ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR OUR SUCCESS.

PRODUCTS

MCDONALDS RESTAURANTS

OFFER A SUBSTANTIALLY UNIFORM MENU. IN ADDITION, MCDONALDS TESTS NEW PRODUCTS ON AN ONGOING BASIS.

MCDONALDS MENU INCLUDES HAMBURGERS AND CHEESEBURGERS, BIG MAC, QUARTER POUNDER WITH CHEESE, BIG N TASTY, FILET-O-FISH, SEVERAL CHICKEN

SANDWICHES, CHICKEN MCNUGGETS, FRENCH FRIES, PREMIUM SALADS, MILK SHAKES, MCFLURRY DESSERTS, SUNDAES AND SOFT SERVE CONES, PIES, COOKIES, AND SOFT DRINKS AND OTHER BEVERAGES. IN ADDITION, THE RESTAURANTS SELL A VARIETY OF OTHER PRODUCTS DURING

LIMITED-TIME PROMOTIONS.

MCDONALDS RESTAURANTS IN THE

MCDONALDS CORPORATION

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL

CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

OVERVIEW

DESCRIPTION OF THE BUSINESS

THE COMPANY PRIMARILY OPERATES AND FRANCHISES MCDONALDS RESTAURANTS. IN ADDITION, THE

COMPANY OPERATES CERTAIN NON-MCDONALDS BRANDS THAT ARE NOT MATERIAL TO THE COMPANYS OVERALL RESULTS. OF THE MORE THAN 30,000 MCDONALDS RESTAURANTS IN OVER 100 COUNTRIES, MORE THAN 8,000 ARE OPERATED BY THE COMPANY, APPROXIMATELY

18,000 ARE OPERATED BY FRANCHISEES AND ABOUT 4,000 ARE OPERATED BY AFFILIATES UNDER LICENSE AGREEMENTS. REGARDLESS OF WHO OPERATES THE RESTAURANT, THE COMPANY GENERALLY OWNS THE LAND AND BUILDING OR SECURES LONG-TERM LEASES FOR RESTAURANT SITES.

THIS ENSURES LONG-TERM OCCUPANCY RIGHTS AND HELPS CONTROL RELATED COSTS.

REVENUES CONSIST OF SALES BY COMPANY-OPERATED RESTAURANTS AND FEES FROM RESTAURANTS OPERATED BY FRANCHISEES AND AFFILIATES. THESE FEES PRIMARILY INCLUDE RENT, SERVICE FEES AND/OR ROYALTIES THAT ARE BASED ON A PERCENT

OF SALES, WITH SPECIFIED MINIMUM RENT PAYMENTS. FEES VARY BY TYPE OF SITE, INVESTMENT BY THE COMPANY AND LOCAL BUSINESS CONDITIONS. THESE FEES, ALONG WITH OCCUPANCY AND OPERATING RIGHTS, ARE STIPULATED IN FRANCHISE AGREEMENTS THAT GENERALLY HAVE

20-YEAR TERMS.

WE MANAGE THE BUSINESS BASED ON GEOGRAPHIC

SEGMENTS: UNITED STATES; EUROPE; ASIA/PACIFIC, THE MIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA (APMEA); LATIN AMERICA AND CANADA. IN ADDITION, THROUGHOUT THIS REPORT WE PRESENT A SEGMENT ENTITLED OTHER THAT INCLUDES NON-MCDONALDS BRANDS. THE U.S. AND

EUROPE SEGMENTS ACCOUNT FOR APPROXIMATELY 70% OF TOTAL REVENUES. FRANCE, GERMANY AND THE UNITED KINGDOM ACCOUNT FOR ABOUT 65% OF EUROPES REVENUES; AUSTRALIA, CHINA AND JAPAN (A 50%-OWNED AFFILIATE ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER THE EQUITY METHOD) ACCOUNT

FOR ABOUT 45% OF APMEAS REVENUES; AND BRAZIL ACCOUNTS FOR ABOUT 40% OF LATIN AMERICAS REVENUES. THESE SEVEN MARKETS ALONG WITH THE U.S. AND CANADA ARE REFERRED TO AS MAJOR MARKETS THROUGHOUT THIS REPORT AND COMPRISE

APPROXIMATELY 70% OF TOTAL REVENUES.

IN ANALYZING BUSINESS

TRENDS, MANAGEMENT CONSIDERS A VARIETY OF PERFORMANCE AND FINANCIAL MEASURES INCLUDING SYSTEMWIDE SALES GROWTH, COMPARABLE SALES GROWTH AND COMPANY-OPERATED MARGINS. SYSTEMWIDE SALES INCLUDE SALES BY ALL RESTAURANTS, WHETHER OPERATED BY THE COMPANY,

BY FRANCHISEES OR BY AFFILIATES. WHILE SALES BY FRANCHISEES AND AFFILIATES ARE NOT RECORDED AS REVENUES BY THE COMPANY, MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THE INFORMATION IS IMPORTANT IN UNDERSTANDING THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE BECAUSE THEY ARE THE

BASIS ON WHICH THE COMPANY CALCULATES AND RECORDS FRANCHISED AND AFFILIATED REVENUES AND ARE INDICATIVE OF THE FINANCIAL HEALTH OF OUR FRANCHISEE BASE. COMPARABLE SALES ARE A KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATOR USED WITHIN THE RETAIL INDUSTRY AND ARE

INDICATIVE OF ACCEPTANCE OF THE COMPANYS INITIATIVES AS WELL AS LOCAL ECONOMIC AND CONSUMER TRENDS. INCREASES OR DECREASES IN COMPARABLE SALES REPRESENT THE PERCENT CHANGE IN CONSTANT CURRENCY SALES FROM THE SAME PERIOD IN THE PRIOR YEAR FOR

ALL SYSTEMWIDE RESTAURANTS IN OPERATION AT LEAST THIRTEEN MONTHS. CONSTANT CURRENCY RESULTS EXCLUDE THE EFFECTS OF FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION AND ARE CALCULATED BY TRANSLATING CURRENT YEAR RESULTS AT PRIOR YEAR AVERAGE EXCHANGE RATES. MANAGEMENT

REVIEWS AND ANALYZES BUSINESS RESULTS IN CONSTANT CURRENCIES AND BASES CERTAIN COMPENSATION PLANS ON THESE RESULTS BECAUSE THE COMPANY BELIEVES THEY BETTER REPRESENT THE UNDERLYING BUSINESS TRENDS.

STRATEGIC DIRECTION AND 2003 FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE

IN 2001 AND 2002, THE COMPANYS RESULTS REFLECTED A FOCUS ON GROWTH

THROUGH ADDING NEW RESTAURANTS, WITH ASSOCIATED HIGH LEVELS OF CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND INCREASING LEVELS OF DEBT FINANCING. THIS STRATEGY, COMBINED WITH CHALLENGING ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND INCREASED COMPETITION IN CERTAIN KEY MARKETS, ADVERSELY

AFFECTED RESULTS AND RETURNS ON INVESTMENT.

IN 2003, THE

COMPANY INTRODUCED A COMPREHENSIVE REVITALIZATION PLAN TO INCREASE MCDONALDS RELEVANCE TO TODAYS CONSUMERS AS WELL AS IMPROVE OUR FINANCIAL DISCIPLINE. WE REDEFINED OUR STRATEGY TO EMPHASIZE GROWTH THROUGH ADDING MORE CUSTOMERS TO

EXISTING RESTAURANTS. IN LINE WITH THIS, WE TOOK A MORE DISCIPLINED APPROACH TO CAPITAL ALLOCATION AND PUT A GREATER EMPHASIS ON CONTROLLING EXPENSES. WE ALIGNED THE SYSTEM AROUND OUR CUSTOMER-FOCUSED PLAN TO WIN, DESIGNED TO DELIVER OPERATIONAL

EXCELLENCE AND LEADERSHIP MARKETING. THIS PLAN CONTAINS AGGRESSIVE GOALS AND MEASURES FOR SUCCESS BASED ON THE FIVE DRIVERS OF EXCEPTIONAL CUSTOMER EXPERIENCESPEOPLE, PRODUCTS, PLACE, PRICE AND PROMOTION.

OUR NEAR-TERM GOAL WAS TO FORTIFY THE FOUNDATION OF OUR BUSINESS. OUR

LONG-TERM GOAL IS TO CREATE A DIFFERENTIATED CUSTOMER EXPERIENCEONE THAT BUILDS BRAND LOYALTYAND ENABLES US TO DELIVER ATTRACTIVE TOP- AND BOTTOM-LINE GROWTH AND RETURNS ON A SUSTAINED BASIS. FOR 2005 AND BEYOND, MCDONALDS IS

TARGETING ANNUAL SYSTEMWIDE SALES AND REVENUE GROWTH OF 3 PERCENT TO 5 PERCENT, ANNUAL OPERATING INCOME GROWTH OF 6 PERCENT TO 7 PERCENT AND ANNUAL RETURNS ON INCREMENTAL INVESTED CAPITAL IN THE HIGH TEENS. (RETURN ON INCREMENTAL INVESTED CAPITAL IS

THE CHANGE IN OPERATING INCOME PLUS DEPRECIATION DIVIDED BY THE CHANGE IN GROSS ASSETS.) THESE TARGETS EXCLUDE THE IMPACT OF FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION.

WE MADE SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS IN 2003 IN OPERATIONAL EXCELLENCE AND LEADERSHIP MARKETING. WE IMPROVED OUR CORE MENU AND ADDED SEVERAL SUCCESSFUL NEW

PRODUCTS. WE USED MORE CONSISTENT, RIGOROUS MEASUREMENTS SUCH AS EVALUATIONS BY COMPANY PERSONNEL, INDEPENDENT MYSTERY SHOPPERS AND CUSTOMER RESEARCH TO EVALUATE RESTAURANT PERFORMANCE. USING THIS INFORMATION, ALONG WITH ENHANCED TRAINING AND OTHER

PROCESSES, WE HAVE STRENGTHENED OUR OPERATIONS. WE HAVE EXPANDED OUR EVERYDAY VALUE OFFERINGS, ATTRACTING MORE CUSTOMER VISITS. WE BEGAN TO CREATE MORE RELEVANT

MCDONALDS CORPORATION

9

RESTAURANT ENVIRONMENTS BY UPDATING, REBUILDING AND RELOCATING SOME OF OUR RESTAURANTS. WE ALSO INTRODUCED OUR FIRST

GLOBAL MARKETING STRATEGY, EMBODIED BY THE IM LOVIN IT THEME, WHICH EMPHASIZES MORE CONTEMPORARY MUSIC AND IMAGES AND IS CONNECTING WITH BOTH OUR CUSTOMERS AND OUR EMPLOYEES.

FROM A FINANCIAL PERSPECTIVE, OUR RESULTS ALSO IMPROVED IN 2003. IN CONCERT

WITH THE COMPANYS STRATEGIC SHIFT TO EMPHASIZE GROWTH FROM EXISTING RESTAURANTS, MANAGEMENT IS FOCUSING IN PARTICULAR ON COMPARABLE SALES AND COMPANY-OPERATED MARGIN TRENDS, BOTH OF WHICH GAINED MOMENTUM DURING THE YEAR. PERFORMANCE IN THE

U.S. WAS IMPRESSIVE, WITH ROBUST ANNUAL COMPARABLE SALES AND MARGIN INCREASES. IN EUROPE, WHILE COMPARABLE SALES WERE SLIGHTLY NEGATIVE FOR THE YEAR, THEY IMPROVED SEQUENTIALLY EACH QUARTER, AS DID COMPANY-OPERATED MARGINS, COMPARED WITH THE PRIOR

YEAR. APMEAS COMPARABLE SALES AND COMPANY-OPERATED MARGINS DECLINED FOR THE YEAR, BUT BOTH SHOWED SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN THE SECOND HALF.

AS PART OF THE COMPANYS REVITALIZATION PLAN, WE ELIMINATED PROJECTS NOT DIRECTLY AFFECTING OUR CUSTOMERS EXPERIENCE AND NARROWED

NON-MCDONALDS BRAND ACTIVITIES. THESE ACTIONS ALONG WITH THE WRITE DOWN OF A PORTION OF OUR GOODWILL AND RESTAURANT ASSETS RESULTED IN THE COMPANY RECORDING $408 MILLION OF PRETAX CHARGES (PRIMARILY NONCASH) IN 2003.

HIGHLIGHTS FROM THE YEAR INCLUDED.



COMPARABLE SALES INCREASED 2.4%, A SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT OVER THE 2.1% DECLINE IN 2002.



CONSOLIDATED REVENUES INCREASED 11% TO A NEW RECORD HIGH OF $17 BILLION. EXCLUDING THE POSITIVE IMPACT OF CURRENCY TRANSLATION, REVENUES INCREASED 6%.



SYSTEMWIDE SALES INCREASED 11%. EXCLUDING THE POSITIVE IMPACT OF CURRENCY TRANSLATION, SYSTEMWIDE SALES INCREASED 5%.



NET INCOME PER COMMON SHARE TOTALED $1.15, COMPARED WITH $0.70 IN 2002.



COMPANY-OPERATED MARGINS AS A PERCENT OF SALES IMPROVED 10 BASIS POINTS, PROGRESSING TOWARD OUR GOAL OF INCREASING MARGINS BY 35 BASIS POINTS PER YEAR BEGINNING IN 2005.



CASH FROM OPERATIONS INCREASED $400 MILLION TO $3.3 BILLION, PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY HIGHER SALES AT EXISTING RESTAURANTS AND STRONGER FOREIGN CURRENCIES.



CAPITAL EXPENDITURES WERE REDUCED BY $700 MILLION TO $1.3 BILLION.



DEBT PAY-DOWN TOTALED APPROXIMATELY $900 MILLION.



THE ANNUAL DIVIDEND INCREASED 70% TO MORE THAN $500 MILLION.



SHARE REPURCHASES TOTALED ABOUT $440 MILLION.

OUTLOOK FOR 2004

WE EXPECT 2004 TO BE A YEAR OF ONGOING PROGRESS IN OPERATIONAL EXCELLENCE, LEADERSHIP MARKETING AND KEY FINANCIAL METRICS. WE WILL CONTINUE TO FOCUS OUR REVITALIZATION

EFFORTS ON IMPROVING OUR CUSTOMERS EXPERIENCES BY PROVIDING BETTER SERVICE, ENHANCING FOOD TASTE, MENU VARIETY AND VALUE OFFERINGS, AND CREATING MORE RELEVANT MARKETING. WHILE WE ARE CONFIDENT IN OUR PLANS FOR 2004, WE ALSO ARE CONSCIOUS OF

THE CHALLENGES WE FACE. FOR EXAMPLE, WE MUST CONTINUE TO DELIVER SOLID RESULTS IN THE U.S., A VERY COMPETITIVE MARKETPLACE, DESPITE SEQUENTIALLY MORE DIFFICULT SALES COMPARISONS. WE BELIEVE THAT THE COMBINATION OF INITIATIVES THAT BENEFITED OUR U.S.

BUSINESS IN 2003 WILL CONTINUE TO CREATE POSITIVE MOMENTUM IN 2004.

OUTSIDE THE U.S., SOME KEY MARKETS MUST INCREASE CUSTOMER RELEVANCE, WHILE OTHERS HAVE ECONOMIC CHALLENGES. WE BELIEVE THAT WE ARE IN A BETTER POSITION TO OVERCOME THESE ISSUES TODAY THAN WE HAVE BEEN FOR SOME TIME. OUR PLAN IS TO LEVERAGE

SUCCESSES IN THE U.S. AND OTHER MARKETS LIKE AUSTRALIASUCH AS MORE RELEVANT MENUS, STRONG VALUE PLATFORMS, CREATIVE MARKETING AND BETTER RESTAURANT-LEVEL EXECUTIONTO IMPROVE RESULTS IN ADDITIONAL MARKETS AROUND THE WORLD.

WHILE THE COMPANY DOES NOT PROVIDE SPECIFIC GUIDANCE ON EARNINGS PER SHARE,

THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION IS PROVIDED TO ASSIST IN ANALYZING THE COMPANYS RESULTS.



CHANGES IN CONSTANT CURRENCY SYSTEMWIDE SALES ARE DRIVEN BY RESTAURANT UNIT EXPANSION AND CHANGES IN COMPARABLE SALES. THE COMPANY EXPECTS NET RESTAURANT ADDITIONS TO ADD

APPROXIMATELY ONE PERCENTAGE POINT TO SALES AND OPERATING INCOME GROWTH IN 2004 (IN CONSTANT CURRENCIES). MOST OF THIS ANTICIPATED GROWTH WILL RESULT FROM RESTAURANTS OPENED IN 2003. THE COMPANY DOES NOT PROVIDE SPECIFIC GUIDANCE ON CHANGES IN

COMPARABLE SALES. HOWEVER, AS A PERSPECTIVE, ASSUMING NO CHANGE IN COST STRUCTURE A ONE PERCENTAGE POINT INCREASE IN U.S. COMPARABLE SALES WOULD IMPACT ANNUAL EARNINGS PER SHARE BY ABOUT 2 CENTS. SIMILARLY, AN INCREASE OF ONE PERCENTAGE POINT IN

EUROPES COMPARABLE SALES WOULD IMPACT ANNUAL EARNINGS PER SHARE BY ABOUT 1.5 CENTS.



THE COMPANY EXPECTS FULL YEAR 2004 SELLING, GENERAL & ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES TO BE RELATIVELY FLAT TO UP SLIGHTLY IN CONSTANT CURRENCIES AND TO DECLINE AS A PERCENT OF REVENUES

AND SYSTEMWIDE SALES, COMPARED WITH 2003. HOWEVER, DUE TO THE TIMING OF CERTAIN EXPENSES, THE COMPANY EXPECTS SELLING, GENERAL & ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES TO INCREASE IN THE FIRST HALF OF 2004 AND TO DECLINE IN THE SECOND HALF, COMPARED WITH 2003.



A SIGNIFICANT PART OF THE COMPANYS OPERATING INCOME IS FROM OUTSIDE THE U.S., AND MORE THAN 70% OF ITS TOTAL DEBT IS DENOMINATED IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES. ACCORDINGLY, EARNINGS

ARE AFFECTED BY CHANGES IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES, PARTICULARLY THE EURO AND THE BRITISH POUND. IF THE EURO AND THE BRITISH POUND BOTH MOVE 10% IN THE SAME DIRECTION (COMPARED WITH 2003 AVERAGE RATES),

10

MCDONALDS CORPORATION

THE COMPANYS ANNUAL EARNINGS PER SHARE WOULD CHANGE BY ABOUT 5 CENTS TO 6 CENTS. IN 2003, FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION BENEFITED EARNINGS PER SHARE BY 7 CENTS.



FOR 2004, THE COMPANY EXPECTS ITS NET DEBT PRINCIPAL REPAYMENTS TO BE APPROXIMATELY $400 MILLION TO $700 MILLION. HOWEVER, DESPITE LOWER AVERAGE DEBT BALANCES, THE COMPANY EXPECTS

INTEREST EXPENSE TO BE RELATIVELY FLAT COMPARED WITH 2003 DUE TO STRONGER FOREIGN CURRENCIES.



THE COMPANY EXPECTS THE EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE FOR 2004 TO BE BETWEEN 32.5% AND 33.5%.



THE COMPANY EXPECTS CAPITAL EXPENDITURES FOR 2004 TO BE APPROXIMATELY $1.5 BILLION TO $1.6 BILLION.



THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO RETURN ABOUT $1 BILLION TO SHAREHOLDERS THROUGH DIVIDENDS AND SHARE REPURCHASES IN 2004.

A NUMBER OF FACTORS CAN AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, INCLUDING EFFECTIVENESS OF

OPERATING INITIATIVES AND CHANGES IN GLOBAL AND LOCAL BUSINESS AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS. THESE AND OTHER RISKS ARE NOTED IN THE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS AT THE END OF MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS.

STRATEGIC ACTIONS

IN 2003, THE COMPANY ELIMINATED PROJECTS NOT DIRECTLY IMPACTING ITS CUSTOMERS EXPERIENCE, NARROWED ITS NON-MCDONALDS BRAND ACTIVITIES, ALIGNED ITS SYSTEM

AROUND A SINGLE ACTION PLAN (PLAN TO WIN), AND RE-ESTABLISHED MCDONALDS MARKETING LEADERSHIP THROUGH THE INTRODUCTION OF ITS FIRST EVER GLOBAL BRAND STRATEGY EMBODIED BY THE IM LOVIN IT THEME. THESE ACTIONS WERE

CONSISTENT WITH MANAGEMENTS STRATEGY OF CONCENTRATING THE COMPANYS CAPITAL AND RESOURCES ON THE BEST NEAR-TERM OPPORTUNITIES AND AVOIDING THOSE THAT DISTRACT FROM RESTAURANT-LEVEL EXECUTION.

IN 2002, THE COMPANY INITIATED ACTIONS DESIGNED TO OPTIMIZE RESTAURANT

OPERATIONS AND IMPROVE THE BUSINESS. THEY INCLUDED THE RESTRUCTURING OF CERTAIN INTERNATIONAL MARKETS, THE CLOSING OF A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF UNDERPERFORMING RESTAURANTS, THE DECISION TO TERMINATE A LONG-TERM TECHNOLOGY PROJECT, AND THE

CONSOLIDATION OF CERTAIN HOME OFFICE FACILITIES AND ELIMINATION OF POSITIONS TO CONTROL COSTS, STREAMLINE OPERATIONS AND REALLOCATE RESOURCES.

MCDONALDS CORPORATION

11

IN 2001, THE COMPANY ALSO IMPLEMENTED STRUCTURAL CHANGES AND RESTAURANT INITIATIVES, PRIMARILY IN THE

U.S. THE CHANGES INCLUDED STREAMLINING OPERATIONS BY REDUCING THE NUMBER OF U.S. REGIONS AND DIVISIONS, ENABLING THE COMPANY TO COMBINE STAFF FUNCTIONS AND IMPROVE EFFICIENCY.

THE COMPANY RECORDED CHARGES ASSOCIATED WITH CERTAIN OF THE ABOVE ACTIONS AS SPECIAL ITEMS. SPECIAL ITEMS

GENERALLY REPRESENT ACTIONS OR TRANSACTIONS RELATED TO THE IMPLEMENTATION OF STRATEGIC INITIATIVES OF THE COMPANY, ITEMS THAT ARE UNUSUAL OR INFREQUENT IN NATURE (SUCH AS THE DISPOSITIONS OF CERTAIN NON-MCDONALDS BRANDS IN 2003 AND THE JAPAN

IPO GAIN IN 2001), AND CHARGES RESULTING FROM ANNUAL GOODWILL AND ASSET IMPAIRMENT TESTING. MCDONALDS MANAGEMENT DOES NOT INCLUDE THESE ITEMS WHEN REVIEWING BUSINESS PERFORMANCE TRENDS BECAUSE THEY DO NOT BELIEVE THESE ITEMS ARE INDICATIVE OF

EXPECTED ONGOING RESULTS.

ON A PRETAX BASIS, THE COMPANY

RECORDED $408 MILLION OF SPECIAL CHARGES IN 2003, $853 MILLION OF SPECIAL CHARGES IN 2002 AND $253 MILLION OF SPECIAL ITEMS IN 2001. ALL SPECIAL ITEMS WERE RECORDED IN OTHER OPERATING EXPENSE, EXCEPT AS NOTED IN THE DISCUSSION THAT FOLLOWS.

CERTAIN SPECIAL ITEMS WERE NOT TAX-EFFECTED.

RESTRUCTURING

IN 2003, THE COMPANY RECORDED $272 MILLION OF PRETAX CHARGES CONSISTING OF: $237 MILLION RELATED TO THE LOSS ON THE SALE OF DONATOS PIZZERIA, THE CLOSING OF ALL DONATOS

AND BOSTON MARKET RESTAURANTS OUTSIDE THE U.S. AND THE EXIT OF A DOMESTIC JOINT VENTURE WITH FAZOLIS; AND $35 MILLION RELATED TO REVITALIZATION PLAN ACTIONS OF MCDONALDS JAPAN, INCLUDING HEADCOUNT REDUCTIONS, THE CLOSING OF PRET A MANGER

STORES IN JAPAN, AND THE EARLY TERMINATION OF A LONG-TERM MANAGEMENT SERVICES AGREEMENT.

IN 2002, THE COMPANY RECORDED $267 MILLION OF NET PRETAX CHARGES CONSISTING OF: $201 MILLION RELATED TO THE ANTICIPATED TRANSFER OF OWNERSHIP IN FIVE COUNTRIES IN THE MIDDLE EAST AND LATIN AMERICA TO DEVELOPMENTAL

LICENSEES AND CEASING OPERATIONS IN TWO COUNTRIES IN LATIN AMERICA; $81 MILLION PRIMARILY RELATED TO ELIMINATING APPROXIMATELY 600 POSITIONS (ABOUT HALF OF WHICH WERE IN THE U.S. AND HALF OF WHICH WERE IN INTERNATIONAL MARKETS), REALLOCATING

RESOURCES AND CONSOLIDATING CERTAIN HOME OFFICE FACILITIES TO CONTROL COSTS; AND A $15 MILLION FAVORABLE ADJUSTMENT TO THE 2001 RESTRUCTURING CHARGE DUE TO LOWER EMPLOYEE-RELATED COSTS THAN ORIGINALLY ANTICIPATED. UNDER THE DEVELOPMENTAL LICENSE

BUSINESS STRUCTURE, WHICH THE COMPANY SUCCESSFULLY EMPLOYS IN ABOUT 30 MARKETS OUTSIDE THE U.S. (APPROXIMATELY 400 RESTAURANTS), THE LICENSEE OWNS THE BUSINESS, INCLUDING THE REAL ESTATE INTEREST. WHILE THE COMPANY GENERALLY DOES NOT HAVE ANY

CAPITAL INVESTED IN THESE MARKETS, IT RECEIVES A ROYALTY BASED ON A PERCENT OF SALES.

IN 2001, THE COMPANY RECORDED $200 MILLION OF PRETAX RESTRUCTURING CHARGES RELATED TO INITIATIVES DESIGNED TO IMPROVE THE RESTAURANT EXPERIENCE, PRIMARILY IN THE U.S. THESE INITIATIVES INCLUDED STREAMLINING OPERATIONS

BY REDUCING THE NUMBER OF REGIONS AND DIVISIONS, ENABLING THE COMPANY TO COMBINE STAFF FUNCTIONS AND IMPROVE EFFICIENCY. IN CONNECTION WITH THESE INITIATIVES, THE COMPANY ELIMINATED APPROXIMATELY 850 POSITIONS (700 IN THE U.S., PRIMARILY IN THE

DIVISIONS AND REGIONS, AND 150 IN INTERNATIONAL MARKETS).

RESTAURANT CLOSINGS/ASSET IMPAIRMENT

IN 2003, THE COMPANY RECORDED $136 MILLION OF NET PRETAX CHARGES CONSISTING OF: $148 MILLION PRIMARILY RELATED TO ASSET/GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT, MAINLY IN LATIN AMERICA; $30 MILLION FOR ABOUT 50 RESTAURANT CLOSINGS ASSOCIATED WITH STRATEGIC

ACTIONS IN LATIN AMERICA; AND A $42 MILLION FAVORABLE ADJUSTMENT TO THE 2002 CHARGE FOR RESTAURANT CLOSINGS, PRIMARILY DUE TO ABOUT 85 FEWER CLOSINGS THAN ORIGINALLY ANTICIPATED. THE LOWER CLOSINGS WERE PRIMARILY DUE TO MANAGEMENTS

REASSESSMENT OF THE PLANS AS A RESULT OF THE NEW STRATEGIC DIRECTION OF THE COMPANY.

IN 2002, THE COMPANY RECORDED $402 MILLION OF PRETAX CHARGES CONSISTING OF: $302 MILLION RELATED TO MANAGEMENTS DECISION TO CLOSE 751 UNDERPERFORMING RESTAURANTS PRIMARILY IN THE U.S. AND JAPAN; AND $100 MILLION PRIMARILY RELATED TO

THE IMPAIRMENT OF ASSETS FOR CERTAIN EXISTING RESTAURANTS IN EUROPE AND LATIN AMERICA. MOST OF THE RESTAURANTS IDENTIFIED FOR CLOSING HAD NEGATIVE CASH FLOWS AND/OR VERY LOW ANNUAL SALES VOLUMES. ALSO, IN MANY CASES THEY WOULD HAVE REQUIRED

SIGNIFICANT CAPITAL INVESTMENT TO REMAIN FINANCIALLY VIABLE.

12

MCDONALDS CORPORATION

IN 2001, THE COMPANY RECORDED $135 MILLION OF PRETAX CHARGES CONSISTING OF: $91 MILLION RELATED TO THE

CLOSING OF 163 UNDERPERFORMING RESTAURANTS IN INTERNATIONAL MARKETS; A $24 MILLION ASSET IMPAIRMENT CHARGE IN TURKEY; AND $20 MILLION RELATED TO THE DISPOSITION OF AROMA CAFÉ IN THE U.K.

ALTHOUGH RESTAURANT CLOSINGS OCCUR EACH YEAR, THESE RESTAURANT CLOSING

CHARGES IN EACH YEAR WERE IDENTIFIED AS SPECIAL CHARGES BECAUSE THEY WERE THE RESULT OF SEPARATE INTENSIVE REVIEWS BY MANAGEMENT IN CONJUNCTION WITH OTHER STRATEGIC ACTIONS.

IN 2002, THE COMPANY RECORDED $184 MILLION OF PRETAX CHARGES CONSISTING OF: $170 MILLION PRIMARILY RELATED TO THE WRITE-OFF OF SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT COSTS AS A RESULT OF

MANAGEMENTS DECISION TO TERMINATE A LONG-TERM TECHNOLOGY PROJECT; AND $14 MILLION PRIMARILY RELATED TO THE WRITE-OFF OF RECEIVABLES AND INVENTORY IN VENEZUELA AS A RESULT OF THE TEMPORARY CLOSURE OF ALL MCDONALDS RESTAURANTS DUE TO A

NATIONAL STRIKE. ALTHOUGH THE TERMINATED TECHNOLOGY PROJECT WAS EXPECTED TO DELIVER LONG-TERM BENEFITS, IT WAS NO LONGER VIEWED AS THE BEST USE OF CAPITAL, AS THE ANTICIPATED SYSTEMWIDE COST OVER SEVERAL YEARS WAS EXPECTED TO BE MORE THAN $1

BILLION.

IN 2001, THE COMPANY RECORDED $55 MILLION OF PRETAX

CHARGES CONSISTING OF: $18 MILLION PRIMARILY RELATED TO THE WRITE-OFF OF CERTAIN TECHNOLOGY COSTS; $12 MILLION (RECORDED IN NONOPERATING EXPENSE) PRIMARILY RELATED TO THE WRITE-OFF OF A CORPORATE INVESTMENT; AND $25 MILLION PRIMARILY RELATED TO THE

UNRECOVERABLE COSTS INCURRED IN CONNECTION WITH THE THEFT OF WINNING GAME PIECES FROM THE COMPANYS MONOPOLY AND CERTAIN OTHER PROMOTIONAL GAMES OVER AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF TIME, AND THE RELATED TERMINATION OF THE SUPPLIER OF THE GAME PIECES.

FIFTY INDIVIDUALS (NONE OF WHOM WERE COMPANY EMPLOYEES) WERE CONVICTED OF CONSPIRACY AND/OR MAIL FRAUD CHARGES.

MCDONALDS JAPAN IPO GAIN

IN 2001, MCDONALDS JAPAN, THE COMPANYS 50%-OWNED AFFILIATE, COMPLETED AN IPO OF 12 MILLION SHARES. THE COMPANY RECORDED A $137 MILLION GAIN (PRE AND AFTER

TAX) IN NONOPERATING INCOME TO REFLECT AN INCREASE IN THE CARRYING VALUE OF ITS INVESTMENT AS A RESULT OF THE CASH PROCEEDS FROM THE IPO RECEIVED BY MCDONALDS JAPAN.

IMPACT OF FOREIGN CURRENCIES ON REPORTED RESULTS

WHILE CHANGING FOREIGN CURRENCIES AFFECT REPORTED RESULTS, MCDONALDS LESSENS

EXPOSURES, WHERE PRACTICAL, BY FINANCING IN LOCAL CURRENCIES, HEDGING CERTAIN FOREIGN-DENOMINATED CASH FLOWS, AND BY PURCHASING GOODS AND SERVICES IN LOCAL CURRENCIES.

IN 2003, FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION HAD A POSITIVE IMPACT ON CONSOLIDATED REVENUES, OPERATING INCOME AND EARNINGS PER

SHARE DUE TO THE STRENGTHENING OF SEVERAL MAJOR CURRENCIES, PRIMARILY THE EURO. IN 2002, FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION HAD A MINIMAL IMPACT ON REVENUES AS THE STRONGER EURO AND BRITISH POUND WERE OFFSET BY WEAKER LATIN AMERICAN CURRENCIES (PRIMARILY

THE ARGENTINE PESO, BRAZILIAN REAL AND VENEZUELAN BOLIVAR). OPERATING INCOME IN 2002 WAS POSITIVELY IMPACTED BY FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION PRIMARILY DUE TO THE STRONGER EURO AND BRITISH POUND.

IN THE U.S., ONGOING

MENU, SERVICE AND VALUE INITIATIVES DROVE THE INCREASE IN REVENUES IN 2003 AS THE U.S. ACHIEVED ITS HIGHEST ANNUAL COMPARABLE SALES INCREASE SINCE 1987. THESE INITIATIVES INCLUDED THE INTRODUCTION OF PREMIUM SALADS AND MCGRIDDLES BREAKFAST

SANDWICHES, THE DOLLAR MENU, EXTENDED HOURS, A HEIGHTENED FOCUS ON OPERATIONS, MORE DISCIPLINED MEASUREMENTS AND A NEW MARKETING DIRECTION. RESULTS ALSO REFLECTED IMPROVEMENT IN THE U.S. ECONOMY IN 2003. IN 2002, REVENUES INCREASED SLIGHTLY DUE TO

RESTAURANT EXPANSION. RESULTS IN 2002, IN PART, REFLECTED THE OVERALL SLOWDOWN IN THE RESTAURANT INDUSTRY AND INCREASED COMPETITION.

IN 2003 AND 2002, EUROPES REVENUES REFLECTED STRONG PERFORMANCE IN RUSSIA DRIVEN BY EXPANSION AND POSITIVE COMPARABLE SALES, ALONG WITH EXPANSION IN

FRANCE. THESE RESULTS WERE PARTLY OFFSET BY WEAK RESULTS IN THE U.K. AND GERMANY, ALTHOUGH GERMANYS PERFORMANCE IMPROVED IN THE SECOND HALF OF 2003.

IN 2003 AND 2002, APMEAS REVENUES BENEFITED FROM POSITIVE COMPARABLE SALES IN AUSTRALIA AND EXPANSION IN CHINA. REVENUES WERE NEGATIVELY AFFECTED IN

2003 BY WEAK RESULTS IN HONG KONG, SOUTH KOREA AND TAIWAN, COMPOUNDED BY CONSUMER CONCERNS ABOUT SEVERE ACUTE RESPIRATORY SYNDROME (SARS) IN SEVERAL MARKETS IN THE FIRST HALF OF THE YEAR. IN ADDITION, JAPAN HAD NEGATIVE COMPARABLE SALES FOR 2003 AND

2002, ALTHOUGH THE MARKETS PERFORMANCE IMPROVED IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2003. IN 2002, REVENUES REFLECTED A BENEFIT FROM THE RESTRUCTURING OF OUR OWNERSHIP IN THE PHILIPPINES, EFFECTIVE JULY 2001, THAT RESULTED IN THE RECLASSIFICATION OF

FRANCHISED RESTAURANTS TO COMPANY-OPERATED.

IN LATIN AMERICA,

REVENUES IN 2003 INCREASED IN CONSTANT CURRENCIES PRIMARILY DUE TO A HIGHER PERCENTAGE OF COMPANY-OPERATED RESTAURANTS. THE INCREASE IN REVENUES IN 2002 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO POSITIVE COMPARABLE SALES IN BRAZIL AND EXPANSION IN MEXICO.

BRACKETED AMOUNTS RESULTED FROM FAVORABLE ADJUSTMENTS TO 2002 CHARGES PRIMARILY DUE TO FEWER THAN ANTICIPATED RESTAURANT CLOSINGS.

IN 2003, U.S. OPERATING INCOME INCLUDED HIGHER COMBINED OPERATING MARGIN

DOLLARS, HIGHER SELLING, GENERAL & ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES AND HIGHER OTHER OPERATING EXPENSES (EXCLUDING SPECIAL CHARGES). U.S. OPERATING INCOME IN 2002 INCLUDED LOWER COMBINED OPERATING MARGIN DOLLARS, LOWER SELLING, GENERAL &

ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES AND LOWER OTHER OPERATING INCOME (EXCLUDING SPECIAL CHARGES).

EUROPES CONSTANT CURRENCY RESULTS IN 2003 AND 2002 BENEFITED FROM STRONG PERFORMANCES IN FRANCE AND RUSSIA. HOWEVER, DIFFICULT ECONOMIC CONDITIONS IN GERMANY AND WEAK RESULTS IN THE U.K. NEGATIVELY IMPACTED

RESULTS IN BOTH YEARS. DESPITE THE DIFFICULT ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, GERMANYS PERFORMANCE IMPROVED IN THE SECOND HALF OF 2003.

APMEAS CONSTANT CURRENCY RESULTS IN 2003 REFLECTED STRONG RESULTS IN AUSTRALIA. HOWEVER, WEAK RESULTS IN MOST OTHER MARKETS, COMPOUNDED BY CONCERNS

ABOUT SARS IN CERTAIN MARKETS, NEGATIVELY IMPACTED THE SEGMENT. IN 2002, STRONG RESULTS IN AUSTRALIA WERE MORE THAN OFFSET BY WEAK RESULTS IN JAPAN AND HONG KONG.

LATIN AMERICAS OPERATING INCOME IN CONSTANT CURRENCIES SIGNIFICANTLY DECLINED IN BOTH 2003 AND 2002 DUE TO THE

CONTINUING DIFFICULT ECONOMIC CONDITIONS EXPERIENCED BY SEVERAL KEY MARKETS IN THE SEGMENT. IN ADDITION, LATIN AMERICAS RESULTS FOR BOTH YEARS WERE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY HIGHER PROVISIONS FOR UNCOLLECTIBLE RECEIVABLES. THE COMPANY IS

CURRENTLY IN LITIGATION WITH ABOUT ONE-THIRD OF THE FRANCHISEES IN BRAZIL, WHICH IS NEGATIVELY IMPACTING THE COMPANYS RESULTS IN LATIN AMERICA. WE EXPECT THIS TO CONTINUE IN THE NEAR TERM.

COMPANY-OPERATED MARGINS

COMPANY-OPERATED MARGIN DOLLARS REPRESENT SALES BY COMPANY-OPERATED RESTAURANTS LESS THE

OPERATING COSTS OF THESE RESTAURANTS. COMPANY-OPERATED MARGIN DOLLARS INCREASED $182 MILLION OR 12% (5% IN CONSTANT CURRENCIES) IN 2003 AND DECLINED $12 MILLION OR 1% (3% IN CONSTANT CURRENCIES) IN 2002. THE CONSTANT CURRENCY INCREASE IN 2003 WAS

PRIMARILY DUE TO STRONG COMPARABLE SALES IN THE U.S. THE CONSTANT CURRENCY DECREASE IN 2002 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO NEGATIVE COMPARABLE SALES AND HIGHER LABOR RATES, PARTLY OFFSET BY RESTAURANT EXPANSION.

OPERATING COST TRENDS

AS A PERCENT OF SALES WERE AS FOLLOWS: FOOD & PAPER COSTS DECREASED IN 2003 AND 2002, PAYROLL COSTS WERE FLAT IN 2003 AND INCREASED IN 2002, AND OCCUPANCY & OTHER OPERATING EXPENSES INCREASED IN BOTH YEARS.

THE U.S. COMPANY-OPERATED MARGIN PERCENT INCREASED IN 2003 PRIMARILY DUE TO

POSITIVE COMPARABLE SALES AND LOWER PAYROLL AS A PERCENT OF SALES DUE TO IMPROVED PRODUCTIVITY AND LOWER WAGE INFLATION. HIGHER COMMODITY COSTS PARTLY OFFSET THESE TRENDS. IN 2002, THE U.S. COMPANY-OPERATED MARGIN PERCENT BENEFITED FROM THE

ELIMINATION OF GOODWILL AMORTIZATION AND A LOWER ADVERTISING CONTRIBUTION RATE, WHILE WEAK COMPARABLE SALES AND HIGHER LABOR COSTS NEGATIVELY IMPACTED THE MARGIN.

IN 2003, EUROPES COMPANY-OPERATED MARGIN PERCENT REFLECTED WEAK PERFORMANCE IN THE U.K. (WHICH HAS THE LARGEST NUMBER

OF COMPANY-OPERATED RESTAURANTS IN EUROPE), PARTLY OFFSET BY IMPROVED MARGIN PERFORMANCE IN GERMANY AND FRANCE. IN 2002, EUROPES COMPANY-OPERATED MARGIN PERCENT REFLECTED HIGHER LABOR COSTS AND AN INCREASE IN OCCUPANCY & OTHER OPERATING

EXPENSES.

FRANCHISED MARGINS

FRANCHISED MARGIN DOLLARS REPRESENT REVENUES FROM FRANCHISED AND AFFILIATED RESTAURANTS LESS

THE COMPANYS OCCUPANCY COSTS (RENT AND DEPRECIATION) ASSOCIATED WITH THOSE SITES. FRANCHISED MARGIN DOLLARS REPRESENTED MORE THAN 65% OF THE COMBINED OPERATING MARGINS IN 2003, 2002 AND 2001. FRANCHISED MARGIN DOLLARS INCREASED $341 MILLION OR

11% (5% IN CONSTANT CURRENCIES) IN 2003 AND $36 MILLION OR 1% (FLAT IN CONSTANT CURRENCIES) IN 2002.

THE CONSOLIDATED

FRANCHISED MARGIN PERCENT DECLINED SLIGHTLY IN 2003 AS POSITIVE COMPARABLE SALES WERE OFFSET BY HIGHER OCCUPANCY COSTS, DUE IN PART TO AN INCREASED PROPORTION OF LEASED SITES. THE DECLINE IN THE CONSOLIDATED FRANCHISED MARGIN PERCENT IN 2002

REFLECTED NEGATIVE COMPARABLE SALES, HIGHER RENT ASSISTANCE TO FRANCHISEES PRIMARILY IN THE U.S. AND EUROPE, AND HIGHER OCCUPANCY COSTS, DUE IN PART TO AN INCREASED PROPORTION OF LEASED SITES.

SELLING, GENERAL & ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES

CONSOLIDATED SELLING, GENERAL & ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES INCREASED 7% IN 2003 AND 3%

IN 2002 (3% AND 4% IN CONSTANT CURRENCIES). THE CONSTANT CURRENCY INCREASE IN 2003 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER PERFORMANCE-BASED INCENTIVE COMPENSATION, AS WELL AS SEVERANCE AND OTHER COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE STRATEGIC DECISION TO REDUCE RESTAURANT

OPENINGS. THE CONSTANT CURRENCY INCREASE IN 2002 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER SPENDING ON TECHNOLOGY IN THE CORPORATE SEGMENT, HIGHER ADVERTISING EXPENSES IN THE U.S. PRIMARILY RELATED TO THE INTRODUCTION OF THE DOLLAR MENU, AND HIGHER EXPENSES FOR

NON-MCDONALDS BRANDS.

SELLING, GENERAL & ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES AS A PERCENT OF REVENUES DECLINED TO 10.7% IN 2003

& ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES AS A PERCENT OF SYSTEMWIDE SALES AS WELL AS REVENUES IS MEANINGFUL BECAUSE THESE COSTS ARE INCURRED TO SUPPORT SYSTEMWIDE RESTAURANTS.

COMPANY-OPERATED RESTAURANTS AS WELL AS GAINS FROM EXERCISES OF PURCHASE OPTIONS BY FRANCHISEES WITH BUSINESS FACILITIES LEASE ARRANGEMENTS (ARRANGEMENTS WHERE THE COMPANY LEASES THE BUSINESSES, INCLUDING EQUIPMENT, TO FRANCHISEES WHO HAVE OPTIONS

TO PURCHASE THE BUSINESSES). THE COMPANYS PURCHASES AND SALES OF BUSINESSES WITH ITS FRANCHISEES AND AFFILIATES ARE AIMED AT ACHIEVING AN OPTIMAL OWNERSHIP MIX IN EACH MARKET. RESULTING GAINS OR LOSSES ARE RECORDED IN OPERATING INCOME BECAUSE

THE TRANSACTIONS ARE A RECURRING PART OF OUR BUSINESS. THE COMPANY EXPECTS LOWER GAINS ON SALES OF RESTAURANT BUSINESSES IN 2004 COMPARED WITH 2003.

EQUITY IN EARNINGS OF UNCONSOLIDATED AFFILIATESBUSINESSES IN WHICH THE COMPANY ACTIVELY PARTICIPATES BUT DOES NOT CONTROLIS REPORTED AFTER INTEREST EXPENSE

AND INCOME TAXES, EXCEPT FOR U.S. RESTAURANT PARTNERSHIPS, WHICH ARE REPORTED BEFORE INCOME TAXES. THE INCREASE IN 2003 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO STRONG RESULTS IN THE U.S. THE DECREASE IN 2002 WAS DUE TO A NET LOSS FROM OUR JAPANESE AFFILIATE COMPARED

WITH EARNINGS IN 2001.

OTHER EXPENSE

OTHER EXPENSE IN 2003 REFLECTED HIGHER LOSSES ON ASSET DISPOSITIONS, HIGHER PROVISIONS FOR

UNCOLLECTIBLE RECEIVABLES (PRIMARILY IN LATIN AMERICA), AND COSTS IN THE U.S. RELATED TO SITES THAT WILL NO LONGER BE DEVELOPED AS A RESULT OF MANAGEMENTS DECISION TO SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE CAPITAL EXPENDITURES. OTHER EXPENSE IN 2002 REFLECTED

PAYMENTS TO U.S. OWNER/OPERATORS TO FACILITATE THE INTRODUCTION OF A NEW FRONT COUNTER SERVICE SYSTEM AND HIGHER PROVISIONS FOR UNCOLLECTIBLE RECEIVABLES (PRIMARILY IN EUROPE AND LATIN AMERICA), PARTLY OFFSET BY A BENEFIT FROM THE ELIMINATION OF

GOODWILL AMORTIZATION. THE COMPANY EXPECTS LOWER OTHER EXPENSE IN 2004 COMPARED WITH 2003.

INTEREST EXPENSE

INTEREST EXPENSE INCREASED IN 2003 DUE TO STRONGER FOREIGN CURRENCIES, PARTLY OFFSET BY LOWER AVERAGE DEBT LEVELS AND INTEREST RATES. INTEREST EXPENSE DECREASED IN 2002

DUE TO LOWER AVERAGE INTEREST RATES, PARTLY OFFSET BY HIGHER AVERAGE DEBT LEVELS AND STRONGER FOREIGN CURRENCIES.

NONOPERATING EXPENSE, NET

NONOPERATING EXPENSE INCLUDES MISCELLANEOUS INCOME AND EXPENSE ITEMS SUCH AS INTEREST INCOME, MINORITY INTERESTS, AND GAINS AND LOSSES RELATED TO OTHER INVESTMENTS,

FINANCINGS AND FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION. NONOPERATING EXPENSE IN 2003 REFLECTED AN $11 MILLION LOSS ON THE EARLY EXTINGUISHMENT OF $200 MILLION OF DEBT AS WELL AS HIGHER FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION LOSSES COMPARED WITH 2002. NONOPERATING

EXPENSE IN 2002 REFLECTED HIGHER MINORITY INTEREST EXPENSE AND FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION LOSSES IN 2002 COMPARED WITH FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION GAINS

GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS,

WHICH ELIMINATES THE AMORTIZATION OF GOODWILL AND INSTEAD SUBJECTS IT TO ANNUAL IMPAIRMENT TESTS. SEE SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES NOTE TO THE

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION.

CASH FLOWS

THE COMPANY GENERATES

SIGNIFICANT CASH FROM OPERATIONS AND HAS SUBSTANTIAL CREDIT CAPACITY TO FUND OPERATING AND DISCRETIONARY SPENDING. CASH FROM OPERATIONS TOTALED $3.3 BILLION AND EXCEEDED CAPITAL EXPENDITURES BY $2.0 BILLION IN 2003, WHILE CASH FROM OPERATIONS

TOTALED $2.9 BILLION AND EXCEEDED CAPITAL EXPENDITURES BY $0.9 BILLION IN 2002. CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATIONS, ALONG WITH BORROWINGS AND OTHER SOURCES OF CASH, IS USED FOR CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, DEBT REPAYMENTS, DIVIDENDS AND SHARE REPURCHASES.

RESTAURANT DEVELOPMENT AND CAPITAL

EXPENDITURES

AS A RESULT OF THE COMPANY STRATEGICALLY SHIFTING ITS FOCUS FROM

ADDING NEW RESTAURANTS TO BUILDING SALES AT EXISTING RESTAURANTS, THE COMPANY SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND RESTAURANT OPENINGS IN 2003 COMPARED WITH 2002 AND 2001.

IN 2003, THE COMPANY OPENED 513 TRADITIONAL MCDONALDS RESTAURANTS AND 319 SATELLITE RESTAURANTS (SMALL, LIMITED-MENU

RESTAURANTS FOR WHICH THE LAND AND BUILDING ARE GENERALLY LEASED), AND CLOSED 486 TRADITIONAL RESTAURANTS AND 184 SATELLITE RESTAURANTS. IN 2002, THE COMPANY OPENED 1,247 TRADITIONAL MCDONALDS RESTAURANTS AND 392 SATELLITE RESTAURANTS, AND

CLOSED 474 TRADITIONAL RESTAURANTS AND 158 SATELLITE RESTAURANTS. ABOUT 65% OF MCDONALDS RESTAURANT ADDITIONS OCCURRED IN THE MAJOR MARKETS IN 2003.

IN 2004, THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO OPEN ABOUT 550 TRADITIONAL MCDONALDS RESTAURANTS AND 300 SATELLITE RESTAURANTS AND CLOSE ABOUT 300 TRADITIONAL RESTAURANTS AND 100 SATELLITE RESTAURANTS.

APPROXIMATELY 60% OF COMPANY-OPERATED RESTAURANTS AND MORE THAN 85% OF

FRANCHISED RESTAURANTS WERE LOCATED IN THE MAJOR MARKETS AT THE END OF 2003. FRANCHISEES AND AFFILIATES OPERATED 73% OF MCDONALDS RESTAURANTS AT YEAR-END 2003. NON-MCDONALDS BRAND RESTAURANTS ARE PRIMARILY COMPANY-OPERATED.

CAPITAL EXPENDITURES DECREASED $697 MILLION OR 35% IN 2003 AND INCREASED

$98 MILLION OR 5% IN 2002. THE DECREASE IN CAPITAL EXPENDITURES IN 2003 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER RESTAURANT OPENINGS, CONSISTENT WITH OUR SHIFT IN STRATEGIC FOCUS, PARTLY OFFSET BY STRONGER FOREIGN CURRENCIES (FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION

INCREASED CAPITAL EXPENDITURES BY $73 MILLION). THE INCREASE IN 2002 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER SPENDING IN THE U.S. AND CANADA, PARTLY OFFSET BY LOWER CAPITAL EXPENDITURES FOR NEW RESTAURANTS IN LATIN AMERICA. CAPITAL EXPENDITURES FOR

MCDONALDS RESTAURANTS

MCDONALDS CORPORATION

IN 2003, 2002 AND 2001 REFLECTED THE LEASING OF A HIGHER PROPORTION OF NEW SITES AND A PROGRAM THAT GAVE U.S. FRANCHISEES

THE OPTION TO PURCHASE NEW RESTAURANT BUILDINGS.

DURING 2003,

THE COMPANY BEGAN TO PHASE OUT THE OPTION FOR U.S. FRANCHISEES TO PURCHASE NEW RESTAURANT BUILDINGS. CONSEQUENTLY, THE COMPANY IS CURRENTLY PURCHASING MOST BUILDINGS AND, AS A RESULT, COLLECTS ADDITIONAL RENT FROM THE FRANCHISEES.

CAPITAL EXPENDITURES INVESTED IN MAJOR MARKETS EXCLUDING JAPAN REPRESENTED

APPROXIMATELY 70% OF THE TOTAL IN 2003 AND 2002 AND 60% IN 2001. JAPAN IS ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER THE EQUITY METHOD, AND ACCORDINGLY ITS CAPITAL EXPENDITURES ARE NOT INCLUDED IN CONSOLIDATED AMOUNTS.

CAPITAL EXPENDITURES FOR NEW RESTAURANTS DECREASED $544 MILLION OR 47% IN 2003 BECAUSE THE COMPANY OPENED FEWER RESTAURANTS AND CONCENTRATED NEW

RESTAURANT INVESTMENTS IN MARKETS WITH ACCEPTABLE RETURNS OR OPPORTUNITIES FOR LONG-TERM GROWTH. WHILE CAPITAL EXPENDITURES FOR EXISTING RESTAURANTS DECREASED IN 2003, THEY INCREASED AS A PERCENTAGE OF TOTAL CAPITAL SPENDING. THIS IS DUE TO THE

COMPANYS FOCUS ON GROWING SALES AT EXISTING RESTAURANTS INCLUDING REINVESTMENT INITIATIVES SUCH AS RESTAURANT REIMAGING IN SEVERAL MARKETS AROUND THE WORLD, INCLUDING THE U.S.

AVERAGE DEVELOPMENT COSTS VARY WIDELY BY MARKET DEPENDING ON THE TYPES OF RESTAURANTS BUILT AND THE REAL ESTATE AND

CONSTRUCTION COSTS WITHIN EACH MARKET. THESE COSTS, WHICH INCLUDE LAND, BUILDINGS AND EQUIPMENT OWNED BY THE COMPANY, ARE MANAGED THROUGH THE USE OF OPTIMALLY SIZED RESTAURANTS, CONSTRUCTION AND DESIGN EFFICIENCIES, STANDARDIZATION AND GLOBAL

SOURCING. IN ADDITION, FOREIGN CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS AFFECT AVERAGE DEVELOPMENT COSTS. IN 2004, THE COMPANY IS TARGETING ELEVEN CONSOLIDATED MARKETS, INCLUDING THE U.S., FOR OPENING TEN OR MORE RESTAURANTS. ALTHOUGH THE COMPANY IS NOT RESPONSIBLE

FOR ALL COSTS ON EVERY RESTAURANT OPENED, IN 2003 TOTAL DEVELOPMENT COSTS (CONSISTING OF LAND, BUILDINGS AND EQUIPMENT) FOR NEW TRADITIONAL MCDONALDS RESTAURANTS AVERAGED APPROXIMATELY $1.8 MILLION IN THE U.S. AND APPROXIMATELY $1.7 MILLION IN

THE TEN MARKETS OUTSIDE THE U.S.

THE COMPANY AND ITS

AFFILIATES OWNED ABOUT 37% OF THE LAND AND 60% OF THE BUILDINGS FOR ITS RESTAURANTS AT YEAR-END 2003 AND 2002.

SHARE REPURCHASES AND DIVIDENDS

DURING 2003, THE COMPANY ACQUIRED 18.9 MILLION SHARES OF MCDONALDS STOCK FOR APPROXIMATELY $439 MILLION UNDER A $5.0 BILLION SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM AUTHORIZED IN

2001. THROUGH 2003, 39.0 MILLION SHARES FOR $975 MILLION HAVE BEEN REPURCHASED UNDER THIS PROGRAM.

THE COMPANY HAS PAID DIVIDENDS ON ITS COMMON STOCK FOR 28 CONSECUTIVE YEARS AND HAS INCREASED THE DIVIDEND AMOUNT EVERY YEAR. IN 2003, THE COMPANY

DECLARED A 70% INCREASE IN THE ANNUAL DIVIDEND TO $504 MILLION, REFLECTING THE COMPANYS CONFIDENCE IN THE ONGOING STRENGTH AND RELIABILITY OF ITS CASH FLOW, THE POSITIVE RESULTS FROM ITS REVITALIZATION EFFORTS AND FAVORABLE CHANGES IN THE U.S.

TAX LAW. AS IN THE PAST, FUTURE DIVIDENDS WILL BE CONSIDERED AFTER REVIEWING RETURNS TO SHAREHOLDERS, PROFITABILITY EXPECTATIONS AND FINANCING NEEDS AND WILL BE DECLARED AT THE DISCRETION OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS. CASH DIVIDENDS ARE DECLARED AND

PAID ON AN ANNUAL BASIS.

FINANCIAL POSITION AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

TOTAL ASSETS AND RETURNS

TOTAL ASSETS GREW BY

$1.6 BILLION OR 6% IN 2003 AND $1.4 BILLION OR 6% IN 2002. CHANGES IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES INCREASED TOTAL ASSETS BY APPROXIMATELY $1.9 BILLION IN 2003 AND $785 MILLION IN 2002. AT YEAR-END 2003 AND 2002, APPROXIMATELY 65% OF CONSOLIDATED

ASSETS WAS LOCATED IN THE MAJOR MARKETS EXCLUDING JAPAN. NET PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT ROSE $1.3 BILLION IN 2003 AND REPRESENTED 78% OF TOTAL ASSETS AT YEAR END.

OPERATING INCOME IS USED TO COMPUTE RETURN ON AVERAGE ASSETS, WHILE INCOME BEFORE THE CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF ACCOUNTING CHANGES IS USED TO CALCULATE

RETURN ON AVERAGE COMMON EQUITY. MONTH-END BALANCES ARE USED TO COMPUTE BOTH AVERAGE ASSETS AND AVERAGE COMMON EQUITY.

RETURN ON AVERAGE ASSETS AND RETURN ON AVERAGE COMMON EQUITY BOTH BEGAN TO STABILIZE DUE TO STRONG OPERATING RESULTS IN THE U.S., PARTLY OFFSET BY CONTINUED WEAK OPERATING RESULTS IN MOST MARKETS IN APMEA AND LATIN AMERICA. IN 2002, RETURN ON

AVERAGE ASSETS AND RETURN ON AVERAGE COMMON EQUITY BOTH DECLINED, PRIMARILY DUE TO WEAK OPERATING RESULTS IN APMEA AND LATIN AMERICA. DURING 2004, THE COMPANY WILL CONTINUE TO CONCENTRATE MCDONALDS RESTAURANT OPENINGS AND NEW CAPITAL INVESTED

IN MARKETS WITH ACCEPTABLE RETURNS OR OPPORTUNITIES FOR LONG-TERM GROWTH.

MCDONALDS CORPORATION

FINANCINGS AND MARKET RISK

THE COMPANY GENERALLY BORROWS ON A LONG-TERM BASIS AND IS EXPOSED TO THE IMPACT OF INTEREST

RATE CHANGES AND FOREIGN CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS. DEBT OBLIGATIONS AT DECEMBER 31, 2003 TOTALED $9.7 BILLION COMPARED WITH $10.0 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2002. THE NET DECREASE IN 2003 WAS DUE TO NET PAYMENTS ($892 MILLION) AND SFAS NO. 133 NONCASH

FAIR VALUE ADJUSTMENTS ($44 MILLION), PARTLY OFFSET BY THE IMPACT OF CHANGES IN EXCHANGE RATES ON FOREIGN CURRENCY DENOMINATED DEBT ($686 MILLION).

MOODYS, STANDARD & POORS AND FITCH CURRENTLY RATE MCDONALDS COMMERCIAL PAPER P-1, A-1 AND F1; AND ITS

LONG-TERM DEBT A2, A AND A, RESPECTIVELY. HISTORICALLY THE COMPANY HAS NOT EXPERIENCED DIFFICULTY IN OBTAINING FINANCING OR REFINANCING EXISTING DEBT. THE COMPANYS KEY METRICS FOR MONITORING ITS CREDIT STRUCTURE ARE SHOWN IN THE PRECEDING

TABLE. WHILE THE COMPANY TARGETS THESE METRICS FOR EASE OF FOCUS, IT ALSO LOOKS AT SIMILAR CREDIT RATIOS THAT INCORPORATE CAPITALIZED OPERATING LEASES TO ESTIMATE TOTAL ADJUSTED DEBT USING A MULTIPLE OF EIGHT TIMES RENT EXPENSE AFTER CONSIDERING

CERTAIN ADJUSTMENTS TO MORE ACCURATELY REFLECT ITS TOTAL AGGREGATE LEASE COMMITMENTS. THESE ADJUSTMENTS INCLUDE: EXCLUDING PERCENT RENTS IN EXCESS OF MINIMUM RENTS; EXCLUDING CERTAIN COMPANY-OPERATED RESTAURANT LEASE AGREEMENTS OUTSIDE THE U.S. THAT

ARE CANCELABLE WITH MINIMAL PENALTIES (REPRESENTING APPROXIMATELY 20% OF COMPANY-OPERATED RESTAURANT LEASES OUTSIDE THE U.S., BASED ON THE COMPANYS ESTIMATE); CAPITALIZING NON-RESTAURANT LEASES USING A MULTIPLE OF THREE TIMES RENT EXPENSE; AND

REDUCING TOTAL RENT EXPENSE BY APPROXIMATELY HALF OF THE ANNUAL MINIMUM RENT PAYMENTS DUE TO THE COMPANY FROM FRANCHISEES OPERATING ON LEASED SITES.

CERTAIN OF THE COMPANYS DEBT OBLIGATIONS CONTAIN CROSS-ACCELERATION PROVISIONS AND RESTRICTIONS ON COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARY MORTGAGES AND THE

LONG-TERM DEBT OF CERTAIN SUBSIDIARIES. THERE ARE NO PROVISIONS IN THE COMPANYS DEBT OBLIGATIONS THAT WOULD ACCELERATE REPAYMENT OF DEBT AS A RESULT OF A CHANGE IN CREDIT RATINGS OR A MATERIAL ADVERSE CHANGE IN THE COMPANYS BUSINESS. THE

COMPANY HAS $1.3 BILLION AVAILABLE UNDER COMMITTED LINE OF CREDIT AGREEMENTS (SEE DEBT FINANCING NOTE TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS) AS WELL AS $1.6 BILLION UNDER A U.S. SHELF REGISTRATION AND $607 MILLION UNDER A EURO MEDIUM-TERM NOTES

PROGRAM FOR FUTURE DEBT ISSUANCE.

THE COMPANY USES MAJOR

CAPITAL MARKETS, BANK FINANCINGS AND DERIVATIVES TO MEET ITS FINANCING REQUIREMENTS AND REDUCE INTEREST EXPENSE. THE COMPANY MANAGES ITS DEBT PORTFOLIO IN RESPONSE TO CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES AND FOREIGN CURRENCY RATES BY PERIODICALLY RETIRING,

REDEEMING AND REPURCHASING DEBT, TERMINATING EXCHANGE AGREEMENTS AND USING DERIVATIVES. THE COMPANY DOES NOT USE DERIVATIVES WITH A LEVEL OF COMPLEXITY OR WITH A RISK HIGHER THAN THE EXPOSURES TO BE HEDGED AND DOES NOT HOLD OR ISSUE DERIVATIVES FOR

TRADING PURPOSES. ALL EXCHANGE AGREEMENTS ARE OVER-THE-COUNTER INSTRUMENTS.

IN MANAGING THE IMPACT OF INTEREST RATE CHANGES AND FOREIGN CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS, THE COMPANY USES INTEREST RATE EXCHANGE AGREEMENTS AND FINANCES IN THE CURRENCIES IN WHICH ASSETS ARE DENOMINATED. ALL DERIVATIVES

WERE RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE IN THE COMPANYS CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET AT DECEMBER 31, 2003 AND 2002 AS FOLLOWS: MISCELLANEOUS OTHER ASSETS$102 MILLION AND $134 MILLION; OTHER LONG-TERM LIABILITIES (EXCLUDING INTEREST)$136 MILLION

AND $39 MILLION; AND ACCRUED PAYROLL AND OTHER LIABILITIES$29 MILLION AND $24 MILLION. SEE SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES NOTE TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS RELATED TO FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

REGARDING THEIR USE AND THE IMPACT OF SFAS NO.133 REGARDING DERIVATIVES.

THE COMPANY USES FOREIGN CURRENCY DEBT AND DERIVATIVES TO HEDGE THE FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK ASSOCIATED WITH CERTAIN ROYALTIES, INTERCOMPANY FINANCINGS AND LONG-TERM INVESTMENTS IN FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES AND AFFILIATES.

THIS REDUCES THE IMPACT OF FLUCTUATING FOREIGN CURRENCIES ON CASH FLOWS AND SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY. TOTAL FOREIGN CURRENCY DENOMINATED DEBT, INCLUDING THE EFFECTS OF FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE AGREEMENTS, WAS $6.8 BILLION AT YEAR-END 2003 AND $6.2

BILLION AT YEAR-END 2002. IN ADDITION, WHERE PRACTICAL, MCDONALDS RESTAURANTS PURCHASE GOODS AND SERVICES IN LOCAL CURRENCIES RESULTING IN NATURAL HEDGES.

THE COMPANY DOES NOT HAVE SIGNIFICANT EXPOSURE TO ANY INDIVIDUAL COUNTERPARTY AND HAS MASTER AGREEMENTS THAT CONTAIN NETTING ARRANGEMENTS. CERTAIN OF

THESE AGREEMENTS ALSO REQUIRE EACH PARTY TO POST COLLATERAL IF CREDIT RATINGS FALL BELOW, OR AGGREGATE EXPOSURES EXCEED, CERTAIN CONTRACTUAL LIMITS. AT DECEMBER 31, 2003, THE COMPANY WAS REQUIRED TO POST COLLATERAL OF $11.6 MILLION, AND AT DECEMBER

31, 2002, COLLATERAL OF $2.2 MILLION WAS POSTED BY A COUNTERPARTY.

THE COMPANYS NET ASSET EXPOSURE IS DIVERSIFIED AMONG A BROAD BASKET OF CURRENCIES. THE COMPANYS LARGEST NET ASSET EXPOSURES (DEFINED AS FOREIGN CURRENCY ASSETS LESS FOREIGN CURRENCY LIABILITIES) AT YEAR END WERE AS FOLLOWS.

THE COMPANY PREPARED SENSITIVITY ANALYSES OF ITS FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS TO DETERMINE THE IMPACT OF

HYPOTHETICAL CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES AND FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES ON THE COMPANYS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, CASH FLOWS AND THE FAIR VALUE OF ITS FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS. THE INTEREST RATE ANALYSIS ASSUMED A ONE PERCENTAGE POINT ADVERSE

CHANGE IN INTEREST RATES ON ALL FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS BUT DID NOT CONSIDER THE EFFECTS OF THE REDUCED LEVEL OF ECONOMIC ACTIVITY THAT COULD EXIST IN SUCH AN ENVIRONMENT. THE FOREIGN CURRENCY RATE ANALYSIS ASSUMED THAT EACH FOREIGN CURRENCY RATE

WOULD CHANGE BY 10% IN THE SAME DIRECTION RELATIVE TO THE U.S. DOLLAR ON ALL FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS; HOWEVER, THE ANALYSIS DID NOT INCLUDE THE POTENTIAL IMPACT ON SALES LEVELS OR LOCAL CURRENCY PRICES OR THE EFFECT OF FLUCTUATING CURRENCIES ON THE

COMPANYS ANTICIPATED FOREIGN CURRENCY ROYALTIES AND OTHER PAYMENTS RECEIVED IN THE U.S. BASED ON THE RESULTS OF THESE ANALYSES OF THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, NEITHER A ONE PERCENTAGE POINT ADVERSE CHANGE IN INTEREST RATES FROM

2003 LEVELS NOR A 10% ADVERSE CHANGE IN FOREIGN CURRENCY RATES FROM 2003 LEVELS WOULD MATERIALLY AFFECT THE COMPANYS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, CASH FLOWS OR THE FAIR VALUE OF ITS FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS.

CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS

THE COMPANY HAS LONG-TERM CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS PRIMARILY IN THE FORM OF LEASE OBLIGATIONS

(RELATED TO BOTH COMPANY-OPERATED AND FRANCHISED RESTAURANTS) AND DEBT OBLIGATIONS. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY HAS LONG-TERM REVENUE AND CASH FLOW STREAMS THAT RELATE TO ITS FRANCHISE ARRANGEMENTS. CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATIONS (INCLUDING CASH PROVIDED

BY THESE FRANCHISE ARRANGEMENTS) ALONG WITH THE COMPANYS BORROWING CAPACITY AND OTHER SOURCES OF CASH WILL BE USED TO SATISFY THE OBLIGATIONS. THE FOLLOWING TABLE SUMMARIZES THE COMPANYS CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND THEIR AGGREGATE

MATURITIES AS WELL AS FUTURE MINIMUM RENT PAYMENTS DUE TO THE COMPANY UNDER EXISTING FRANCHISE ARRANGEMENTS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2003. (SEE DISCUSSIONS OF CASH FLOWS, FINANCIAL POSITION AND CAPITAL RESOURCES AS WELL AS THE NOTES TO THE DECEMBER 31,

THE COMPANY MAINTAINS A NONQUALIFIED, UNFUNDED SUPPLEMENTAL PLAN THAT ALLOWS PARTICIPANTS TO MAKE TAX-DEFERRED CONTRIBUTIONS AND RECEIVE COMPANY-PROVIDED

ALLOCATIONS THAT CANNOT BE MADE UNDER THE PROFIT SHARING AND SAVINGS PLAN BECAUSE OF INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE LIMITATIONS. THE INVESTMENT ALTERNATIVES AND RETURNS IN THE SUPPLEMENTAL PLAN ARE BASED ON CERTAIN MARKET-RATE INVESTMENT ALTERNATIVES

UNDER THE PROFIT SHARING AND SAVINGS PLAN. TOTAL LIABILITIES UNDER THE SUPPLEMENTAL PLAN WERE $329 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2003 AND $297 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2002, AND WERE INCLUDED IN OTHER LONG-TERM LIABILITIES IN THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE

SHEET.

IN ADDITION TO LONG-TERM OBLIGATIONS, THE COMPANY HAD

GUARANTEED CERTAIN AFFILIATE AND OTHER LOANS TOTALING $89 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2003.

OTHER MATTERS

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IS BASED UPON THE COMPANYS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, WHICH HAVE

BEEN PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE U.S. THE PREPARATION OF THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS REQUIRES THE COMPANY TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS THAT AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS, LIABILITIES,

REVENUES AND EXPENSES AS WELL AS RELATED DISCLOSURES. ON AN ONGOING BASIS, THE COMPANY EVALUATES ITS ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS BASED ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND VARIOUS OTHER FACTORS THAT ARE BELIEVED TO BE REASONABLE UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES. ACTUAL

RESULTS MAY DIFFER FROM THESE ESTIMATES UNDER DIFFERENT ASSUMPTIONS OR CONDITIONS.

THE COMPANY REVIEWS ITS FINANCIAL REPORTING AND DISCLOSURE PRACTICES AND ACCOUNTING POLICIES QUARTERLY TO ENSURE THAT THEY PROVIDE ACCURATE AND TRANSPARENT INFORMATION RELATIVE TO THE CURRENT ECONOMIC AND BUSINESS

ENVIRONMENT. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT OF ITS SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES THE FOLLOWING INVOLVE A HIGHER DEGREE OF JUDGMENT AND/OR COMPLEXITY.

PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT

PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT ARE DEPRECIATED OR AMORTIZED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THEIR USEFUL LIVES BASED ON MANAGEMENTS ESTIMATES OF THE PERIOD OVER WHICH THE

ASSETS WILL GENERATE REVENUE. THE USEFUL LIVES ARE ESTIMATED BASED ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE WITH SIMILAR ASSETS, TAKING INTO ACCOUNT ANTICIPATED TECHNOLOGICAL OR OTHER CHANGES. THE COMPANY PERIODICALLY REVIEWS THESE LIVES RELATIVE TO PHYSICAL

FACTORS, ECONOMIC FACTORS AND INDUSTRY TRENDS. IF THERE ARE CHANGES IN THE PLANNED USE OF PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT OR IF TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGES OCCUR MORE RAPIDLY THAN ANTICIPATED, THE USEFUL LIVES ASSIGNED TO THESE ASSETS MAY NEED TO BE SHORTENED,

RESULTING IN THE RECOGNITION OF INCREASED DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION EXPENSE IN FUTURE PERIODS.

MCDONALDS CORPORATION

LONG-LIVED ASSETS

LONG-LIVED ASSETS (INCLUDING GOODWILL) ARE REVIEWED FOR IMPAIRMENT ANNUALLY IN THE FOURTH QUARTER AND WHENEVER EVENTS OR CHANGES IN

CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THAT THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF AN ASSET MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE. IN ASSESSING THE RECOVERABILITY OF THE COMPANYS LONG-LIVED ASSETS, THE COMPANY CONSIDERS CHANGES IN ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND MAKES ASSUMPTIONS REGARDING

ESTIMATED FUTURE CASH FLOWS AND OTHER FACTORS. (THE BIGGEST ASSUMPTION IMPACTING ESTIMATED FUTURE CASH FLOWS IS THE ESTIMATED CHANGE IN COMPARABLE SALES.) ESTIMATES OF FUTURE CASH FLOWS ARE HIGHLY SUBJECTIVE JUDGMENTS BASED ON THE COMPANYS

EXPERIENCE AND KNOWLEDGE OF OPERATIONS. THESE ESTIMATES CAN BE SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACTED BY MANY FACTORS INCLUDING CHANGES IN GLOBAL AND LOCAL BUSINESS AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, OPERATING COSTS, INFLATION, COMPETITION, AND CONSUMER AND DEMOGRAPHIC

TRENDS. IF THE COMPANYS ESTIMATES OR UNDERLYING ASSUMPTIONS CHANGE IN THE FUTURE, THE COMPANY MAY BE REQUIRED TO RECORD IMPAIRMENT CHARGES.

RESTRUCTURING AND LITIGATION ACCRUALS

THE COMPANY HAS RECORDED CHARGES RELATED TO RESTRUCTURING MARKETS, CLOSING RESTAURANTS, ELIMINATING POSITIONS AND OTHER STRATEGIC CHANGES. THE ACCRUALS RECORDED INCLUDED

ESTIMATES PERTAINING TO EMPLOYEE TERMINATION COSTS, NUMBER OF RESTAURANTS TO BE CLOSED AND REMAINING LEASE OBLIGATIONS FOR CLOSED FACILITIES. ALTHOUGH THE COMPANY DOES NOT ANTICIPATE SIGNIFICANT CHANGES, THE ACTUAL COSTS MAY DIFFER FROM THESE

ESTIMATES.

FROM TIME TO TIME, THE COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO

PROCEEDINGS, LAWSUITS AND OTHER CLAIMS RELATED TO FRANCHISEES, SUPPLIERS, EMPLOYEES, CUSTOMERS, COMPETITORS AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY. THE COMPANY IS REQUIRED TO ASSESS THE LIKELIHOOD OF ANY ADVERSE JUDGMENTS OR OUTCOMES TO THESE MATTERS AS WELL AS

POTENTIAL RANGES OF PROBABLE LOSSES. A DETERMINATION OF THE AMOUNT OF ACCRUAL REQUIRED, IF ANY, FOR THESE CONTINGENCIES IS MADE AFTER CAREFUL ANALYSIS OF EACH MATTER. THE REQUIRED ACCRUAL MAY CHANGE IN THE FUTURE DUE TO NEW DEVELOPMENTS IN EACH

MATTER OR CHANGES IN APPROACH SUCH AS A CHANGE IN SETTLEMENT STRATEGY IN DEALING WITH THESE MATTERS. THE COMPANY DOES NOT BELIEVE THAT ANY SUCH MATTER WILL HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON ITS FINANCIAL CONDITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

INCOME TAXES

THE COMPANY RECORDS A VALUATION ALLOWANCE TO REDUCE ITS DEFERRED TAX ASSETS IF IT IS MORE

LIKELY THAN NOT THAT SOME PORTION OR ALL OF THE DEFERRED ASSETS WILL NOT BE REALIZED. WHILE THE COMPANY HAS CONSIDERED FUTURE TAXABLE INCOME AND ONGOING PRUDENT AND FEASIBLE TAX STRATEGIES IN ASSESSING THE NEED FOR THE VALUATION ALLOWANCE, IF THESE

ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS CHANGE IN THE FUTURE, THE COMPANY MAY BE REQUIRED TO ADJUST ITS VALUATION ALLOWANCE. THIS COULD RESULT IN A CHARGE TO, OR AN INCREASE IN, INCOME IN THE PERIOD SUCH DETERMINATION IS MADE.

DEFERRED U.S. INCOME TAXES HAVE NOT BEEN RECORDED FOR BASIS DIFFERENCES

TOTALING $4.2 BILLION RELATED TO INVESTMENTS IN CERTAIN FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES OR AFFILIATES. THE BASIS DIFFERENCES CONSIST PRIMARILY OF UNDISTRIBUTED EARNINGS CONSIDERED PERMANENTLY INVESTED IN THE BUSINESSES. IF MANAGEMENTS INTENTIONS CHANGE

IN THE FUTURE, DEFERRED TAXES MAY NEED TO BE PROVIDED.

ADDITION, THE COMPANY OPERATES WITHIN MULTIPLE TAXING JURISDICTIONS AND IS SUBJECT TO AUDIT IN THESE JURISDICTIONS. THE COMPANY RECORDS ACCRUALS FOR THE ESTIMATED OUTCOMES OF THESE AUDITS, AND THE ACCRUALS MAY CHANGE IN THE FUTURE DUE TO NEW

DEVELOPMENTS IN EACH MATTER.

EFFECTS OF

CHANGING PRICES  INFLATION

THE COMPANY HAS DEMONSTRATED AN ABILITY TO

MANAGE INFLATIONARY COST INCREASES EFFECTIVELY. THIS IS BECAUSE OF RAPID INVENTORY TURNOVER, THE ABILITY TO ADJUST MENU PRICES, COST CONTROLS AND SUBSTANTIAL PROPERTY HOLDINGSMANY OF WHICH ARE AT FIXED COSTS AND PARTLY FINANCED BY DEBT MADE

LESS EXPENSIVE BY INFLATION.

MCDONALDS CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

NATURE OF BUSINESS

THE COMPANY PRIMARILY OPERATES AND FRANCHISES MCDONALDS RESTAURANTS IN THE FOOD SERVICE INDUSTRY. THE COMPANY ALSO OPERATES BOSTON MARKET AND CHIPOTLE MEXICAN GRILL

IN THE U.S. AND HAS A MINORITY OWNERSHIP IN U.K.-BASED PRET A MANGER. IN DECEMBER 2003, THE COMPANY SOLD ITS DONATOS PIZZERIA BUSINESS.

ALL RESTAURANTS ARE OPERATED EITHER BY THE COMPANY, BY INDEPENDENT ENTREPRENEURS UNDER THE TERMS OF FRANCHISE ARRANGEMENTS (FRANCHISEES), OR BY AFFILIATES

OPERATING UNDER LICENSE AGREEMENTS.

CONSOLIDATION

THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDE THE

ACCOUNTS OF THE COMPANY AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES. SUBSTANTIALLY ALL INVESTMENTS IN AFFILIATES OWNED 50% OR LESS (PRIMARILY MCDONALDS JAPAN) ARE ACCOUNTED FOR BY THE EQUITY METHOD.

ESTIMATES IN FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN CONFORMITY WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE U.S. REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO MAKE

ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT THE AMOUNTS REPORTED IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND ACCOMPANYING NOTES. ACTUAL RESULTS COULD DIFFER FROM THOSE ESTIMATES.

REVENUE RECOGNITION

THE COMPANYS REVENUES CONSIST OF SALES BY COMPANY-OPERATED RESTAURANTS AND FEES FROM RESTAURANTS OPERATED BY FRANCHISEES AND AFFILIATES. SALES BY COMPANY-OPERATED

RESTAURANTS ARE RECOGNIZED ON A CASH BASIS. FEES FROM FRANCHISED AND AFFILIATED RESTAURANTS INCLUDE CONTINUING RENT AND SERVICE FEES, INITIAL FEES AND ROYALTIES RECEIVED FROM FOREIGN AFFILIATES AND DEVELOPMENTAL LICENSEES. CONTINUING FEES AND

ROYALTIES ARE RECOGNIZED IN THE PERIOD EARNED. INITIAL FEES ARE RECOGNIZED UPON OPENING OF A RESTAURANT, WHICH IS WHEN THE COMPANY HAS PERFORMED SUBSTANTIALLY ALL INITIAL SERVICES REQUIRED BY THE FRANCHISE ARRANGEMENT.

FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION

THE FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY OF SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OPERATIONS OUTSIDE THE U.S. IS THE RESPECTIVE

LOCAL CURRENCY, EXCEPT FOR A SMALL NUMBER OF COUNTRIES WITH HYPERINFLATIONARY ECONOMIES, WHERE THE FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY IS THE U.S. DOLLAR.

ADVERTISING COSTS

ADVERTISING COSTS INCLUDED IN COSTS OF COMPANY-OPERATED RESTAURANTS PRIMARILY CONSIST OF CONTRIBUTIONS TO ADVERTISING COOPERATIVES AND WERE (IN MILLIONS): 2003$596.7; 2002$532.3; 2001$521.5.

PRODUCTION COSTS FOR RADIO AND TELEVISION ADVERTISING, PRIMARILY IN THE U.S., ARE EXPENSED WHEN THE COMMERCIALS ARE INITIALLY AIRED. THESE PRODUCTION COSTS AS WELL AS OTHER MARKETING-RELATED EXPENSES INCLUDED IN SELLING, GENERAL & ADMINISTRATIVE

EXPENSES WERE (IN MILLIONS): 2003$113.1; 2002$115.3; 2001$79.4. IN ADDITION, SIGNIFICANT ADVERTISING COSTS ARE INCURRED BY FRANCHISEES THROUGH ADVERTISING COOPERATIVES IN INDIVIDUAL MARKETS.

STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION

THE COMPANY ACCOUNTS FOR ALL STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION AS PRESCRIBED BY ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES

BOARD OPINION NO. 25. THE COMPANY DISCLOSES PRO FORMA NET INCOME AND NET INCOME PER COMMON SHARE, AS PROVIDED BY STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS (SFAS) NO. 123, AS AMENDED BY SFAS NO. 148,

ACCOUNTING FOR STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION.

THE PRO FORMA INFORMATION WAS DETERMINED AS IF THE COMPANY HAD

ACCOUNTED FOR ITS EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTIONS UNDER THE FAIR VALUE METHOD OF SFAS NO. 123. THE FAIR VALUE OF THESE OPTIONS WAS ESTIMATED AT THE DATE OF GRANT USING AN OPTION PRICING MODEL. THE MODEL WAS DESIGNED TO ESTIMATE THE FAIR VALUE OF

EXCHANGE-TRADED OPTIONS THAT, UNLIKE EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTIONS, CAN BE TRADED AT ANY TIME AND ARE FULLY TRANSFERABLE. IN ADDITION, SUCH MODELS REQUIRE THE INPUT OF HIGHLY SUBJECTIVE ASSUMPTIONS INCLUDING THE EXPECTED VOLATILITY OF THE STOCK PRICE. FOR

PRO FORMA DISCLOSURES, THE OPTIONS ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE WAS AMORTIZED OVER THEIR VESTING PERIOD. THE FOLLOWING TABLES PRESENT THE PRO FORMA DISCLOSURES AND THE WEIGHTED-AVERAGE ASSUMPTIONS USED TO ESTIMATE THE FAIR VALUE OF THESE OPTIONS.

PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT

PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT ARE STATED AT COST, WITH DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION PROVIDED USING THE STRAIGHT-LINE METHOD OVER THE FOLLOWING

ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES: BUILDINGSUP TO 40 YEARS; LEASEHOLD IMPROVEMENTSTHE LESSER OF USEFUL LIVES OF ASSETS OR LEASE TERMS INCLUDING OPTION PERIODS; AND EQUIPMENTTHREE TO 12 YEARS.

GOODWILL

GOODWILL REPRESENTS THE EXCESS OF COST OVER THE NET TANGIBLE ASSETS OF ACQUIRED RESTAURANT

BUSINESSES. THE COMPANYS GOODWILL PRIMARILY CONSISTS OF AMOUNTS PAID IN EXCESS OF NET TANGIBLE ASSETS FOR PURCHASES OF MCDONALDS RESTAURANTS FROM FRANCHISEES AND OWNERSHIP INCREASES IN INTERNATIONAL SUBSIDIARIES OR AFFILIATES.

IN 2001, THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD ISSUED SFAS

NO. 141,

BUSINESS COMBINATIONS,

AND NO. 142,

GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS.

SFAS NO. 141 REQUIRES THAT THE PURCHASE METHOD OF ACCOUNTING BE USED FOR ALL BUSINESS COMBINATIONS INITIATED AFTER JUNE 30, 2001 AND INCLUDES GUIDANCE

ON THE INITIAL RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT OF GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS ARISING FROM BUSINESS COMBINATIONS. SFAS NO. 142, EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2002, ELIMINATES THE AMORTIZATION OF GOODWILL (AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS DEEMED TO HAVE INDEFINITE

LIVES) AND INSTEAD SUBJECTS IT TO ANNUAL IMPAIRMENT TESTS. OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS CONTINUE TO BE AMORTIZED OVER THEIR USEFUL LIVES. APPLICATION OF THE NONAMORTIZATION PROVISIONS OF SFAS NO. 142 IN 2001 WOULD HAVE INCREASED NET INCOME BY

APPROXIMATELY $30 MILLION ($0.02 PER SHARE).

UNDER SFAS NO.

142, GOODWILL IS GENERALLY ASSIGNED TO THE REPORTING UNITS EXPECTED TO BENEFIT FROM THE SYNERGIES OF THE COMBINATION. IF A COMPANY-OPERATED RESTAURANT IS SOLD WITHIN 24 MONTHS OF ACQUISITION, THE GOODWILL ASSOCIATED WITH THE ACQUISITION IS WRITTEN

OFF IN ITS ENTIRETY. IF A RESTAURANT IS SOLD BEYOND 24 MONTHS FROM THE ACQUISITION, THE AMOUNT OF GOODWILL WRITTEN OFF IS BASED ON THE RELATIVE FAIR VALUE OF THE BUSINESS SOLD COMPARED TO THE PORTION OF THE REPORTING UNIT (DEFINED AS EACH INDIVIDUAL

COUNTRY FOR MCDONALDS RESTAURANT BUSINESS AS WELL AS EACH INDIVIDUAL NON-MCDONALDS BRAND) THAT WILL BE RETAINED.

THE ANNUAL GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT TEST COMPARES THE FAIR VALUE OF A REPORTING UNIT, GENERALLY BASED ON DISCOUNTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS, WITH ITS CARRYING AMOUNT

INCLUDING GOODWILL. IF THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF A REPORTING UNIT EXCEEDS ITS FAIR VALUE, AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS IS MEASURED AS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE REPORTING UNITS GOODWILL AND THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF GOODWILL.

THE COMPANY PERFORMED THE INITIAL REQUIRED GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT TEST AS OF

JANUARY 1, 2002 AND RECORDED A NONCASH CHARGE OF $98.6 MILLION AFTER TAX ($0.07 PER DILUTED SHARE) FOR THE CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF THIS ACCOUNTING CHANGE. THE IMPAIRED GOODWILL RESULTED PRIMARILY FROM BUSINESSES IN ARGENTINA, URUGUAY AND OTHER MARKETS

IN LATIN AMERICA AND THE MIDDLE EAST, WHERE ECONOMIES HAD WEAKENED SIGNIFICANTLY IN RECENT YEARS.

LONG-LIVED ASSETS

IN ACCORDANCE WITH SFAS NO. 144,

ACCOUNTING FOR THE IMPAIRMENT OR DISPOSAL OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS,

LONG-LIVED ASSETS ARE REVIEWED FOR IMPAIRMENT ANNUALLY IN THE

FOURTH QUARTER AND WHENEVER EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THAT THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF AN ASSET MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE. FOR PURPOSES OF ANNUALLY REVIEWING MCDONALDS RESTAURANT ASSETS FOR POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT, ASSETS ARE INITIALLY

GROUPED TOGETHER AT A TELEVISION MARKET LEVEL IN THE U.S. AND AT A COUNTRY LEVEL FOR EACH OF THE INTERNATIONAL MARKETS. IF AN INDICATOR OF IMPAIRMENT (E.G., NEGATIVE OPERATING CASH FLOWS FOR THE MOST RECENT TRAILING TWELVE-MONTH PERIOD) EXISTS FOR

ANY GROUPING OF ASSETS, AN ESTIMATE OF UNDISCOUNTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS PRODUCED BY EACH INDIVIDUAL RESTAURANT WITHIN THE ASSET GROUPING IS COMPARED TO ITS CARRYING VALUE. IF AN ASSET IS DETERMINED TO BE IMPAIRED, THE LOSS IS MEASURED BY THE EXCESS OF

THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF THE ASSET OVER ITS FAIR VALUE AS DETERMINED BY AN ESTIMATE OF DISCOUNTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS.

LOSSES ON ASSETS HELD FOR DISPOSAL ARE RECOGNIZED WHEN MANAGEMENT HAS APPROVED AND COMMITTED TO A PLAN TO DISPOSE OF THE ASSETS, AND THE ASSETS ARE

AVAILABLE FOR DISPOSAL. GENERALLY, SUCH LOSSES RELATE TO EITHER RESTAURANTS THAT HAVE CLOSED AND CEASED OPERATIONS OR BUSINESSES OR RESTAURANTS THAT ARE AVAILABLE FOR SALE.

MCDONALDS CORPORATION

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

THE COMPANY GENERALLY BORROWS ON A LONG-TERM BASIS AND IS EXPOSED TO THE IMPACT OF INTEREST RATE CHANGES AND FOREIGN CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS.

THE COMPANY USES FOREIGN CURRENCY DENOMINATED DEBT AND DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS TO MANAGE THE IMPACT OF THESE CHANGES. THE COMPANY DOES NOT USE DERIVATIVES WITH A LEVEL OF COMPLEXITY OR WITH A RISK HIGHER THAN THE EXPOSURES TO BE HEDGED AND DOES NOT

HOLD OR ISSUE DERIVATIVES FOR TRADING PURPOSES.

THE

COUNTERPARTIES TO THESE AGREEMENTS CONSIST OF A DIVERSE GROUP OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. THE COMPANY CONTINUALLY MONITORS ITS POSITIONS AND THE CREDIT RATINGS OF ITS COUNTER-PARTIES AND ADJUSTS POSITIONS AS APPROPRIATE. THE COMPANY DID NOT HAVE

SIGNIFICANT EXPOSURE TO ANY INDIVIDUAL COUNTER-PARTY AT DECEMBER 31, 2003 AND HAS MASTER AGREEMENTS THAT CONTAIN NETTING ARRANGEMENTS. CERTAIN OF THESE AGREEMENTS ALSO REQUIRE EACH PARTY TO POST COLLATERAL IF CREDIT RATINGS FALL BELOW OR AGGREGATE

EXPOSURES EXCEED CERTAIN CONTRACTUAL LIMITS. AT DECEMBER 31, 2003, THE COMPANY WAS REQUIRED TO POST COLLATERAL OF $11.6 MILLION, AND AT DECEMBER 31, 2002, COLLATERAL OF $2.2 MILLION WAS POSTED BY A COUNTERPARTY.

EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2001, THE COMPANY ADOPTED SFAS NO. 133,

ACCOUNTING

FOR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES,

AS AMENDED. SFAS NO. 133 REQUIRES COMPANIES TO RECOGNIZE ALL DERIVATIVES AS EITHER ASSETS OR LIABILITIES IN THE BALANCE SHEET AT FAIR VALUE. SFAS NO. 133 ALSO REQUIRES COMPANIES TO DESIGNATE ALL

DERIVATIVES THAT QUALIFY AS HEDGING INSTRUMENTS AS EITHER FAIR VALUE HEDGES, CASH FLOW HEDGES OR HEDGES OF NET INVESTMENTS IN FOREIGN OPERATIONS. THIS DESIGNATION IS BASED UPON THE EXPOSURE BEING HEDGED.

THE COMPANY RECORDED A TRANSITION ADJUSTMENT AT JANUARY 1, 2001 RELATED TO

CASH FLOW HEDGES, WHICH REDUCED ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME IN SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY BY $17.0 MILLION, AFTER TAX. THIS ADJUSTMENT WAS PRIMARILY RELATED TO INTEREST RATE EXCHANGE AGREEMENTS USED TO LOCK IN LONG-TERM BORROWING RATES.

THE CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF ADOPTING SFAS NO. 133 AT JANUARY 1, 2001 WAS NOT MATERIAL TO THE COMPANYS CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF INCOME.

ALL DERIVATIVES, PRIMARILY INTEREST RATE EXCHANGE AGREEMENTS AND FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE AGREEMENTS, WERE CLASSIFIED IN THE COMPANYS CONSOLIDATED

BALANCE SHEET AT DECEMBER 31, 2003 AND 2002 RESPECTIVELY, AS FOLLOWS: MISCELLANEOUS OTHER ASSETS$102.4 MILLION AND $133.9 MILLION; OTHER LONG-TERM LIABILITIES (EXCLUDING ACCRUED INTEREST)$135.5 MILLION AND $39.2 MILLION; AND ACCRUED

PAYROLL AND OTHER LIABILITIES$29.2 MILLION AND $23.8 MILLION.

THERE WAS NO SIGNIFICANT IMPACT TO THE COMPANYS EARNINGS RELATED TO THE INEFFECTIVE PORTION OF ANY HEDGING INSTRUMENTS FOR THE THREE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2003.

FAIR VALUE HEDGES

THE COMPANY ENTERS INTO FAIR VALUE HEDGES TO REDUCE THE EXPOSURE TO CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUES OF CERTAIN ASSETS OR LIABILITIES. THE TYPES

OF FAIR VALUE HEDGES THE COMPANY ENTERS INTO INCLUDE: (1) INTEREST RATE EXCHANGE AGREEMENTS TO CONVERT A PORTION OF ITS FIXED-RATE DEBT TO FLOATING-RATE DEBT AND (2) FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE AGREEMENTS FOR THE EXCHANGE OF VARIOUS CURRENCIES

AND INTEREST RATES. THE FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE AGREEMENTS ARE ENTERED INTO TO HEDGE THE CURRENCY RISK ASSOCIATED WITH DEBT AND INTER-COMPANY LOANS DENOMINATED IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES, AND ESSENTIALLY RESULT IN FLOATING-RATE ASSETS OR LIABILITIES

DENOMINATED IN U.S. DOLLARS OR APPROPRIATE FUNCTIONAL CURRENCIES.

FOR FAIR VALUE HEDGES, THE GAINS OR LOSSES ON DERIVATIVES AS WELL AS THE OFFSETTING GAINS OR LOSSES ON THE RELATED HEDGED ITEMS ARE RECOGNIZED IN CURRENT EARNINGS.

CASH FLOW HEDGES

THE COMPANY ENTERS INTO CASH FLOW HEDGES TO REDUCE THE EXPOSURE TO VARIABILITY IN CERTAIN EXPECTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS. THE TYPES OF CASH FLOW

HEDGES THE COMPANY ENTERS INTO INCLUDE: (1) INTEREST RATE EXCHANGE AGREEMENTS THAT EFFECTIVELY CONVERT A PORTION OF FLOATING-RATE DEBT TO FIXED-RATE DEBT AND ARE DESIGNED TO REDUCE THE IMPACT OF INTEREST RATE CHANGES ON FUTURE INTEREST EXPENSE, (2)

FORWARD FOREIGN EXCHANGE CONTRACTS AND FOREIGN CURRENCY OPTIONS THAT ARE DESIGNED TO PROTECT AGAINST THE REDUCTION IN VALUE OF FORECASTED FOREIGN CURRENCY CASH FLOWS SUCH AS ROYALTIES AND OTHER PAYMENTS DENOMINATED IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES, AND (3)

FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE AGREEMENTS FOR THE EXCHANGE OF VARIOUS CURRENCIES AND INTEREST RATES. THE FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE AGREEMENTS HEDGE THE CURRENCY RISK ASSOCIATED WITH DEBT AND INTERCOMPANY LOANS DENOMINATED IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES, AND

ESSENTIALLY RESULT IN FIXED-RATE ASSETS OR LIABILITIES DENOMINATED IN U.S. DOLLARS OR APPROPRIATE FUNCTIONAL CURRENCIES.

FOR CASH FLOW HEDGES, THE EFFECTIVE PORTION OF THE GAINS OR LOSSES ON DERIVATIVES IS REPORTED IN THE DEFERRED HEDGING ADJUSTMENT COMPONENT OF ACCUMULATED

OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME IN SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY AND RECLASSIFIED INTO EARNINGS IN THE SAME PERIOD OR PERIODS IN WHICH THE HEDGED TRANSACTION AFFECTS EARNINGS. THE REMAINING GAIN OR LOSS IN EXCESS OF THE CUMULATIVE CHANGE IN THE PRESENT VALUE

OF FUTURE CASH FLOWS OF THE HEDGED ITEM, IF ANY, IS RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS DURING THE PERIOD OF CHANGE.

THE COMPANY RECORDED NET INCREASES TO THE DEFERRED HEDGING ADJUSTMENT COMPONENT OF ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME IN SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY OF

$8.0 MILLION, $0.8 MILLION AND $7.7 MILLION, AFTER TAX, RELATED TO CASH FLOW HEDGES DURING THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2003, 2002 AND 2001, RESPECTIVELY. BASED ON INTEREST RATES AND FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES AT DECEMBER 31, 2003, NO

SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF DEFERRED HEDGING ADJUSTMENTS, AFTER TAX, INCLUDED IN ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME IN SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY AT DECEMBER 31, 2003 WILL BE RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS IN 2004 AS THE UNDERLYING HEDGED TRANSACTIONS ARE

REALIZED. THE MAXIMUM MATURITY DATE OF ANY CASH FLOW HEDGE OF FORECASTED TRANSACTIONS AT DECEMBER 31, 2003 WAS 24 MONTHS, EXCLUDING INSTRUMENTS HEDGING FORECASTED PAYMENTS OF VARIABLE INTEREST ON EXISTING FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS THAT HAVE VARIOUS

MATURITY DATES THROUGH 2015.

EXPENSE OVER THE USEFUL LIFE OF THE ASSET. IN FIRST QUARTER 2003, THE COMPANY RECORDED A NONCASH CHARGE OF $36.8 MILLION AFTER TAX ($0.03 PER DILUTED SHARE) RELATED TO LEASE OBLIGATIONS IN CERTAIN INTERNATIONAL MARKETS TO REFLECT THE CUMULATIVE

EFFECT OF THIS ACCOUNTING CHANGE. THERE IS NOT A MATERIAL EFFECT TO THE COMPANYS ONGOING RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR FINANCIAL POSITION.

COMMON EQUITY PUT OPTIONS AND FORWARD CONTRACTS

DURING 2001, THE COMPANY SOLD 12.2 MILLION COMMON EQUITY PUT OPTIONS IN CONNECTION WITH ITS SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM. PREMIUMS RECEIVED OF $31.8 MILLION WERE RECORDED

DEBT FINANCING

LINE OF CREDIT AGREEMENTS

AT DECEMBER 31, 2003, THE COMPANY HAD SEVERAL LINE OF CREDIT AGREEMENTS WITH VARIOUS BANKS TOTALING $1.3 BILLION, ALL OF WHICH REMAINED

UNUSED. SUBSEQUENT TO YEAR END, THE COMPANY RENEGOTIATED THE LINE OF CREDIT AGREEMENTS AS FOLLOWS: $750.0 MILLION OF LINES EXPIRING IN 2005 WITH A TERM OF 364 DAYS AND FEES BASED ON CURRENT CREDIT RATINGS OF .06% PER ANNUM ON THE TOTAL COMMITMENT,

WITH A FEATURE THAT ALLOWS THE COMPANY TO CONVERT THE BORROWINGS TO A ONE-YEAR LOAN AT EXPIRATION; AND A $500.0 MILLION LINE EXPIRING IN 2009 WITH FEES BASED ON CURRENT CREDIT RATINGS OF .08% PER ANNUM ON THE TOTAL COMMITMENT. FEES AND INTEREST

RATES ON THESE LINES ARE BASED ON THE COMPANYS LONG-TERM CREDIT RATING ASSIGNED BY MOODYS AND STANDARD AND POORS. THE NEW AGREEMENTS NO LONGER REQUIRE THE COMPANY TO MAINTAIN A MINIMUM NET WORTH. IN ADDITION, CERTAIN SUBSIDIARIES

OUTSIDE THE U.S. HAD UNUSED LINES OF CREDIT TOTALING $789.3 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2003; THESE WERE PRINCIPALLY SHORT TERM AND DENOMINATED IN VARIOUS CURRENCIES AT LOCAL MARKET RATES OF INTEREST.

THE WEIGHTED-AVERAGE INTEREST RATE OF SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS WAS 4.3% AT

DECEMBER 31, 2003 (BASED ON $341.1 MILLION OF FOREIGN CURRENCY BANK LINE BORROWINGS) AND 3.4% AT DECEMBER 31, 2002 (BASED ON $257.9 MILLION OF COMMERCIAL PAPER AND $614.5 MILLION OF FOREIGN CURRENCY BANK LINE BORROWINGS).

FAIR VALUES

AT DECEMBER 31, 2003, THE FAIR VALUE OF THE COMPANYS DEBT OBLIGATIONS WAS ESTIMATED AT

$10.2 BILLION, COMPARED TO A CARRYING AMOUNT OF $9.7 BILLION. THIS FAIR VALUE WAS ESTIMATED USING VARIOUS PRICING MODELS OR DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW ANALYSES THAT INCORPORATED QUOTED MARKET PRICES. THE COMPANY HAS NO CURRENT PLANS TO RETIRE A

SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF ITS DEBT PRIOR TO MATURITY.

THE CARRYING

AMOUNTS FOR BOTH CASH AND EQUIVALENTS AND NOTES RECEIVABLE APPROXIMATE FAIR VALUE. FOREIGN CURRENCY AND INTEREST RATE EXCHANGE AGREEMENTS, FOREIGN CURRENCY OPTIONS AND FORWARD FOREIGN EXCHANGE CONTRACTS WERE RECORDED IN THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE

SHEET AT FAIR VALUE ESTIMATED USING VARIOUS PRICING MODELS OR DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW ANALYSES THAT INCORPORATED QUOTED MARKET PRICES. NO FAIR VALUE WAS ESTIMATED FOR NONINTEREST-BEARING SECURITY DEPOSITS BY FRANCHISEES, BECAUSE THESE DEPOSITS ARE AN

INTEGRAL PART OF THE OVERALL FRANCHISE ARRANGEMENTS.

MCDONALDS CORPORATION

DEBT OBLIGATIONS

THE COMPANY HAS INCURRED DEBT OBLIGATIONS PRINCIPALLY THROUGH PUBLIC AND PRIVATE OFFERINGS AND BANK LOANS. THERE ARE NO PROVISIONS IN THE

COMPANYS DEBT OBLIGATIONS THAT WOULD ACCELERATE REPAYMENT OF DEBT AS A RESULT OF A CHANGE IN CREDIT RATINGS OR A MATERIAL ADVERSE CHANGE IN THE COMPANYS BUSINESS. CERTAIN OF THE COMPANYS DEBT OBLIGATIONS CONTAIN CROSS-ACCELERATION

PROVISIONS, AND RESTRICTIONS ON COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARY MORTGAGES AND THE LONG-TERM DEBT OF CERTAIN SUBSIDIARIES. UNDER CERTAIN AGREEMENTS, THE COMPANY HAS THE OPTION TO RETIRE DEBT PRIOR TO MATURITY, EITHER AT PAR OR AT A PREMIUM OVER PAR.

2007$666.7; 2008$851.0; THEREAFTER$4,191.0. THESE AMOUNTS INCLUDE RECLASSIFICATIONS OF SHORT-TERM OBLIGATIONS TO LONG-TERM OBLIGATIONS OF $750.0 IN 2006 AND $500.0 THEREAFTER AS THEY ARE SUPPORTED BY LONG-TERM LINE OF CREDIT

AGREEMENTS.

SFAS NO.133 REQUIRES THAT THE UNDERLYING ITEMS IN FAIR VALUE HEDGES, IN THIS CASE DEBT OBLIGATIONS, BE RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE. THE RELATED HEDGING INSTRUMENT IS ALSO RECORDED AT

FAIR VALUE IN EITHER MISCELLANEOUS OTHER ASSETS OR OTHER LONG-TERM LIABILITIES. A PORTION ($131.1 MILLION) OF THE ADJUSTMENTS AT DECEMBER 31, 2003 RELATED TO INTEREST RATE EXCHANGE AGREEMENTS THAT WERE TERMINATED IN DECEMBER 2002 AND WILL AMORTIZE

AS A REDUCTION OF INTEREST EXPENSE OVER THE REMAINING LIFE OF THE DEBT.

(8)

INCLUDES CURRENT MATURITIES OF LONG-TERM DEBT AND LONG-TERM DEBT INCLUDED IN THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET. THE DECREASE IN DEBT OBLIGATIONS FROM DECEMBER 31, 2002 TO DECEMBER

31, 2003 WAS DUE TO NET REPAYMENTS ($891.6 MILLION) AND SFAS NO.133 NONCASH FAIR VALUE ADJUSTMENTS ($43.6 MILLION), PARTLY OFFSET BY THE IMPACT OF CHANGES IN EXCHANGE RATES ON FOREIGN CURRENCY DENOMINATED DEBT ($686.3 MILLION).

ESOP LOANS AND OTHER

GUARANTEES

AT DECEMBER 31, 2003, THE COMPANY HAS GUARANTEED AND INCLUDED IN

TOTAL DEBT $15.4 MILLION OF NOTES ISSUED BY THE LEVERAGED EMPLOYEE STOCK OWNERSHIP PLAN (ESOP) WITH PAYMENTS THROUGH 2006. BORROWINGS RELATED TO THE ESOP AT DECEMBER 31, 2003, WHICH INCLUDE $85.9 MILLION OF LOANS FROM THE COMPANY TO THE ESOP AND THE

$15.4 MILLION OF NOTES GUARANTEED BY THE COMPANY, ARE REFLECTED AS LONG-TERM DEBT WITH A CORRESPONDING REDUCTION OF SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY (UNEARNED ESOP COMPENSATION). THE ESOP IS REPAYING THE LOANS AND INTEREST THROUGH 2018 USING COMPANY

CONTRIBUTIONS AND DIVIDENDS FROM ITS MCDONALDS COMMON STOCK HOLDINGS. AS THE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF THE BORROWINGS IS REPAID, THE DEBT AND THE UNEARNED ESOP COMPENSATION ARE BEING REDUCED.

THE COMPANY ALSO HAS GUARANTEED CERTAIN AFFILIATE AND OTHER LOANS TOTALING

$88.8 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2003. THESE GUARANTEES ARE CONTINGENT COMMITMENTS GENERALLY ISSUED BY THE COMPANY TO SUPPORT BORROWING ARRANGEMENTS OF CERTAIN U.S. PARTNERSHIPS AND FRANCHISEES, AND CERTAIN AFFILIATES. THE TERMS OF THE GUARANTEES VARY

AND ARE EQUAL TO THE REMAINING TERM OF THE RELATED DEBT. AT DECEMBER 31, 2003, THERE WAS NO CARRYING VALUE FOR OBLIGATIONS UNDER THESE GUARANTEES IN THE COMPANYS CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET.

EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS

THE COMPANYS PROFIT SHARING AND SAVINGS PLAN FOR U.S.-BASED EMPLOYEES INCLUDES

PROFIT SHARING, 401(K) AND LEVERAGED EMPLOYEE STOCK OWNERSHIP (ESOP) FEATURES. THE 401(K) FEATURE ALLOWS PARTICIPANTS TO MAKE PRETAX CONTRIBUTIONS THAT ARE PARTLY MATCHED FROM SHARES RELEASED UNDER THE ESOP. MCDONALDS EXECUTIVES, STAFF AND

RESTAURANT MANAGERS

MCDONALDS CORPORATION

37

PARTICIPATE IN ANY ADDITIONAL ESOP ALLOCATIONS AND PROFIT SHARING CONTRIBUTIONS, BASED ON THEIR COMPENSATION. THE PROFIT

SHARING CONTRIBUTION IS DISCRETIONARY, AND THE COMPANY DETERMINES THE AMOUNT EACH YEAR.

EFFECTIVE MARCH 31, 2003, ALL CONTRIBUTIONS AND RELATED EARNINGS CAN BE INVESTED AMONG SEVERAL INVESTMENT ALTERNATIVES, INCLUDING MCDONALDS COMMON STOCK, IN ACCORDANCE WITH EACH PARTICIPANTS ELECTIONS.

PRIOR TO MARCH 31, 2003, ESOP ALLOCATIONS AND EARNINGS WERE GENERALLY INVESTED IN MCDONALDS COMMON STOCK AND ALL OTHER CONTRIBUTIONS AND RELATED EARNINGS COULD BE INVESTED AMONG SEVERAL INVESTMENT ALTERNATIVES, INCLUDING MCDONALDS COMMON

STOCK.

IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY MAINTAINS A NONQUALIFIED,

UNFUNDED SUPPLEMENTAL PLAN THAT ALLOWS PARTICIPANTS TO MAKE TAX-DEFERRED CONTRIBUTIONS AND RECEIVE COMPANY-PROVIDED ALLOCATIONS THAT CANNOT BE MADE UNDER THE PROFIT SHARING AND SAVINGS PLAN BECAUSE OF INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE LIMITATIONS. THE

INVESTMENT ALTERNATIVES IN THE SUPPLEMENTAL PLAN ARE BASED ON CERTAIN OF THE MARKET-RATE INVESTMENT ALTERNATIVES UNDER THE PROFIT SHARING AND SAVINGS PLAN. TOTAL LIABILITIES UNDER THE SUPPLEMENTAL PLAN WERE $329.3 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2003 AND

$297.3 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2002 AND WERE INCLUDED IN OTHER LONG-TERM LIABILITIES IN THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET.

THE COMPANY HAS ENTERED INTO DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS TO HEDGE MARKET-DRIVEN CHANGES IN CERTAIN OF THE SUPPLEMENTAL PLAN LIABILITIES. AT DECEMBER 31, 2003,

DERIVATIVES WITH A FAIR VALUE OF $51.6 MILLION INDEXED TO THE COMPANYS STOCK AND $49.4 MILLION INDEXED TO CERTAIN MARKET INDICES WERE INCLUDED IN MISCELLANEOUS OTHER ASSETS IN THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET. ALL CHANGES IN PLAN LIABILITIES AND

IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE DERIVATIVES ARE RECORDED IN SELLING, GENERAL & ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES. CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE OF THE DERIVATIVES INDEXED TO THE COMPANYS STOCK ARE RECORDED IN THE INCOME STATEMENT BECAUSE THE CONTRACTS PROVIDE THE

COUNTERPARTY WITH A CHOICE TO SETTLE IN CASH OR SHARES.

TOTAL

U.S. COSTS FOR THE PROFIT SHARING AND SAVINGS PLAN, INCLUDING NONQUALIFIED BENEFITS AND RELATED HEDGING ACTIVITIES, WERE (IN MILLIONS): 2003$60.3; 2002$50.1; 2001$54.6.

CERTAIN SUBSIDIARIES OUTSIDE THE U.S. ALSO OFFER PROFIT SHARING, STOCK PURCHASE OR OTHER SIMILAR BENEFIT PLANS. TOTAL PLAN

COSTS OUTSIDE THE U.S. WERE (IN MILLIONS): 2003$43.9; 2002$36.8; 2001$39.7.

OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS AND POSTEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS, EXCLUDING SEVERANCE BENEFITS RELATED TO THE 2002 AND 2001 RESTRUCTURING CHARGES, WERE IMMATERIAL.

STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION

AT DECEMBER 31, 2003, THE COMPANY HAD FIVE STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION PLANS FOR EMPLOYEES AND

NONEMPLOYEE DIRECTORS THAT AUTHORIZE THE GRANTING OF VARIOUS EQUITY-BASED INCENTIVES INCLUDING STOCK OPTIONS, RESTRICTED STOCK AND RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS. THE NUMBER OF SHARES OF COMMON STOCK RESERVED FOR ISSUANCE UNDER THE PLANS WAS 206.0 MILLION

AT DECEMBER 31, 2003, INCLUDING 11.8 MILLION AVAILABLE FOR FUTURE GRANTS.

STOCK OPTIONS

OPTIONS TO PURCHASE COMMON

STOCK ARE GRANTED AT THE FAIR MARKET VALUE OF THE STOCK ON THE DATE OF GRANT. THEREFORE, NO COMPENSATION COST HAS BEEN RECOGNIZED IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF INCOME FOR THESE STOCK OPTIONS. SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE OPTIONS BECOME EXERCISABLE IN

FOUR EQUAL INSTALLMENTS, BEGINNING A YEAR FROM THE DATE OF THE GRANT, AND GENERALLY EXPIRE 10 YEARS FROM THE GRANT DATE. APPROXIMATELY 44 MILLION OPTIONS GRANTED BETWEEN MAY 1, 1999 AND DECEMBER 31, 2000 EXPIRE 13 YEARS FROM THE DATE OF GRANT.

IN 2001, THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS APPROVED A SPECIAL GRANT OF

11.9 MILLION OPTIONS AT A PRICE OF $28.90 AS AN INCENTIVE TO MEET AN OPERATING INCOME PERFORMANCE GOAL FOR CALENDAR YEAR 2003. THE OPTIONS VESTED ON JANUARY 31, 2004 AND EXPIRE ON JUNE 30, 2004, RATHER THAN JUNE 30, 2011, BECAUSE THE COMPANY DID NOT

MEET THE PERFORMANCE GOAL.
