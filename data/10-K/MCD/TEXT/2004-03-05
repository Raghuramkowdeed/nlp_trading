part i   item 1. business   mcdonalds corporation, the registrant, together with its subsidiaries, is referred to herein as the company.
(a) general development of business   during 2003, there have been no significant changes to the companys corporate
structure or material changes in the companys method of conducting business.   (b) financial information about segments   segment data for the years
ended december 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 are included in part ii, item 8, page 35 of this form 10-k.   (c) narrative description of business   general   the company primarily operates and franchises
mcdonalds restaurants in the food service industry. these restaurants serve a varied, yet limited, value-priced menu (see products) in more than 100 countries around the world.   the company also operates boston market and chipotle mexican grill in the u.s. and has a minority ownership interest in
u.k.-based pret a manger. in december 2003, the company sold its donatos pizzeria business.   since mcdonalds restaurant business comprises virtually all of the companys consolidated operating results, this narrative primarily relates to that business, unless otherwise noted.   all restaurants are operated either by the company, by independent
entrepreneurs under the terms of franchise arrangements (franchisees), or by affiliates operating under license agreements.   the companys operations are designed to assure consistency and high quality at every mcdonalds restaurant. when granting franchises and
forming joint-ventures, the company is selective and is not in the practice of franchising to or partnering with investor groups or passive investors.   under the conventional franchise arrangement, franchisees provide capital by initially investing in the equipment, signs, seating and dcor of
their restaurant businesses, and by reinvesting in the business over time. the company generally shares the investment by owning or leasing the land and building. franchisees contribute to the companys revenue stream through payment of rent
and service fees based upon a percent of sales, with specified minimum rent payments, along with initial fees. the conventional franchise arrangement typically lasts 20 years and franchising practices are generally consistent throughout the world. a
discussion regarding site selection is included in part i, item 2, page 5 of this form 10-k.   the company, its franchisees and affiliates purchase food, packaging, equipment and other goods from numerous independent suppliers that have been approved by the company. the company has established and strictly
enforces high-quality standards. the company has quality assurance labs around the world to ensure that our high standards are consistently met. the quality assurance process not only involves ongoing product reviews, but also on-site inspections of
suppliers facilities. further, a quality assurance board, composed of the companys technical, safety and supply chain specialists, provides strategic global leadership for all aspects of food quality and safety. in addition, the company
works closely with suppliers to encourage innovation, assure best practices and drive continuous improvement.   independently owned and operated distribution centers, also approved by the company, distribute products and supplies to most mcdonalds restaurants.
in addition, restaurant personnel are trained in the proper storage, handling and preparation of our products and in the delivery of customer service.   mcdonalds global brand is well known. marketing, promotional and public relations activities are designed to nurture mcdonalds brand image and
differentiate the company from competitors. marketing and promotional efforts focus on value, food taste and the customer experience. in addition, the company is focused on being a leader in social responsibility, as the company believes it is
important to give back to the people and communities around the world who are responsible for our success.   products   mcdonalds restaurants
offer a substantially uniform menu. in addition, mcdonalds tests new products on an ongoing basis.   mcdonalds menu includes hamburgers and cheeseburgers, big mac, quarter pounder with cheese, big n tasty, filet-o-fish, several chicken
sandwiches, chicken mcnuggets, french fries, premium salads, milk shakes, mcflurry desserts, sundaes and soft serve cones, pies, cookies, and soft drinks and other beverages. in addition, the restaurants sell a variety of other products during
limited-time promotions.   mcdonalds restaurants in the
u.s. and certain international markets are open during breakfast hours and offer a full- or limited-breakfast menu. breakfast offerings may include egg mcmuffin, sausage mcmuffin with egg, mcgriddle, biscuit and bagel sandwiches, hotcakes and
muffins.   chipotle serves gourmet burritos and tacos. boston
market is a home-meal replacement concept serving chicken, meatloaf and a variety of other main and side dishes. pret a manger is a quick-service food concept that serves mainly prepared and packaged cold sandwiches, snacks and drinks during
lunchtime.
mcdonalds corporation3
intellectual property   the company owns valuable intellectual property including trademarks, service marks, patents, copyrights, trade secrets and other proprietary information, some of which,
including mcdonalds, the golden arches logo, ronald mcdonald, big mac and other related marks, are of material importance to the companys business. depending on the jurisdiction, trademarks
generally are valid as long as they are used or registered. patents and licenses are of varying remaining durations.   seasonal operations   the company does not consider its operations to be seasonal to any material degree.   working capital practices   information about the companys working capital practices is incorporated herein by reference to managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and
results of operations for the years ended december 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 in part ii, item 7, pages 9 through 23, and the consolidated statement of cash flows for the years ended december 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 in part ii, item 8, page 27 of this
form 10-k.   customers   the companys business is not dependent upon a single customer or small group of
customers.   backlog   company-operated restaurants have no backlog orders.   government contracts   no material portion of the business is subject to renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts or subcontracts at the election of
the u.s. government.   competition   mcdonalds restaurants compete with international, national, regional and local
retailers of food products. the company competes on the basis of price, convenience and service and by offering quality food products. the companys competition in the broadest perspective includes restaurants, quick-service eating
establishments, pizza parlors, coffee shops, street vendors, convenience food stores, delicatessens and supermarkets.   in the u.s., there were about 527,000 restaurants that generated $340 billion in annual sales in 2003. mcdonalds restaurant business accounts for
2.6% of those restaurants and 6.5% of the sales. no reasonable estimate can be made of the number of competitors outside the u.s.   research and development   the company operates a research and development facility in illinois. while research and development activities are important to the companys business, these
expenditures are not material. independent suppliers also conduct research activities that benefit the mcdonalds system, which includes franchisees and suppliers as well as the company, its subsidiaries and joint ventures.   environmental matters   the company is not aware of any federal, state or local environmental laws or regulations that will materially affect its earnings or
competitive position or result in material capital expenditures. however, the company cannot predict the effect on its operations of possible future environmental legislation or regulations. during 2003, there were no material capital expenditures
for environmental control facilities and no such material expenditures are anticipated.   number of employees   during 2003, the companys average
number of employees worldwide, including company-operated restaurant employees, was approximately 418,000. this includes employees at mcdonalds company-operated restaurants as well as other restaurant concepts operated by the company.

identifies and develops sites that offer convenience to customers and long-term sales and profit potential to the company. to assess potential, the company analyzes traffic and walking patterns, census data, school enrollments and other relevant
data. the companys experience and access to advanced technology aid in evaluating this information. the company generally owns the land and building or secures long-term leases for restaurant sites, which ensures long-term occupancy rights and
helps control related costs. restaurant profitability for both the company and franchisees is important; therefore, ongoing efforts are made to control average development costs through construction and design efficiencies, standardization and by
leveraging the companys global sourcing network. additional information about the companys properties is included in managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in part ii, item 7, pages 9

aspects of its business, as discussed below. the company does not believe that any such claims, lawsuits or regulations will have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations.   franchising   a substantial number of mcdonalds restaurants are franchised to independent
entrepreneurs operating under contractual arrangements with the company. in the course of the franchise relationship, occasional disputes arise between the company and its franchisees relating to a broad range of subjects including, but not limited
to, quality, service and cleanliness issues, contentions regarding grants or terminations of franchises, payments of rents, franchisee claims for additional franchises or rewrites of franchises, and delinquent payments. additionally, occasional
disputes arise between the company and individuals who claim they should have been granted a mcdonalds franchise.   suppliers   the company and its affiliates and subsidiaries do not supply, with minor exceptions outside the u.s., food, paper or related items to any mcdonalds restaurants.
the company relies upon numerous independent suppliers that are required to meet and maintain the companys high standards and specifications. on occasion, disputes arise between the company and its suppliers on a number of issues including, by
way of example, compliance with product specifications and the companys business relationship with suppliers. in addition, disputes occasionally arise on a number of issues between the company and individuals or entities who claim that they
should be (or should have been) granted the opportunity to supply products or services to the companys restaurants.   employees   thousands of people are employed by the company and in restaurants owned and operated by subsidiaries of the company. in addition, thousands of people from time to time
seek employment in such restaurants. in the ordinary course of business, disputes arise regarding hiring, firing and promotion practices.   customers   the companys restaurants serve a large cross-section of the public. in the course of serving so many people, disputes arise as to products, service, accidents, advertising, nutritional and other disclosures as
well as other matters typical of an extensive restaurant business such as that of the company.   intellectual property   the company has registered trademarks and service marks, patents and copyrights, some of which are of material importance to the companys business. from time to
time, the company may become involved in litigation to defend and protect the use of its intellectual property.   government regulations   local, state and federal governments have adopted laws and regulations involving various aspects of the restaurant business including, but not limited to, franchising,

dividend amount at least once every year. as in the past, future dividends will be considered after reviewing returns to shareholders, profitability expectations and financing needs and will be declared at the discretion of the companys board

includes pretax operating charges of $378 million primarily related to the u.s. business reorganization and other global change initiatives, and restaurant closings/asset
impairment as well as net pretax nonoperating income of $125 million primarily related to a gain on the initial public offering of mcdonalds japan, for a total pretax expense of $253 million ($143 million after tax or $0.11 per share). (the
cash portion of this net expense was approximately $100 million after tax.) see other operating expense, net note to the consolidated financial statements for further details. net income also reflects an effective tax rate of 29.8 percent, primarily
due to the benefit of tax law changes in certain international markets ($147 million).
(4)
includes pretax charges of $322 million ($219 million after tax or $0.16 per share) consisting of $162 million of made for you costs and $160 million related to a home office
productivity initiative.
(5)
includes a $37 million after-tax charge ($0.03 per share) to reflect the cumulative effect of the adoption of sfas no. 143 accounting for asset retirement
obligations, which requires legal obligations associated with the retirement of long-lived assets to be recognized at their fair value at the time the obligations are incurred. see summary of significant accounting policies note to the
consolidated financial statements for further details.
(6)
includes a $99 million after-tax charge ($0.08 per sharebasic and $0.07 per sharediluted) to reflect the cumulative effect of the adoption of sfas no. 142
goodwill and other intangible assets, which eliminates the amortization of goodwill and instead subjects it to annual impairment tests. see summary of significant accounting policies note to the consolidated financial statements for
further details. adjusted for the nonamortization provisions of sfas no. 142, net income per common share would have been $0.02 higher in 2001 and 2000 and $0.01 higher in 1996-1999.

while franchised and affiliated sales are not recorded as revenues by the company, management believes they are important in understanding the companys financial
performance because these sales are the basis on which the company calculates and records franchised and affiliated revenues and are indicative of the financial health of the franchisee base.
8mcdonalds corporation
item 7. managements discussion and analysis of financial
condition and results of operations   overview   description of the business   the company primarily operates and franchises mcdonalds restaurants. in addition, the
company operates certain non-mcdonalds brands that are not material to the companys overall results. of the more than 30,000 mcdonalds restaurants in over 100 countries, more than 8,000 are operated by the company, approximately
18,000 are operated by franchisees and about 4,000 are operated by affiliates under license agreements. regardless of who operates the restaurant, the company generally owns the land and building or secures long-term leases for restaurant sites.
this ensures long-term occupancy rights and helps control related costs.   revenues consist of sales by company-operated restaurants and fees from restaurants operated by franchisees and affiliates. these fees primarily include rent, service fees and/or royalties that are based on a percent
of sales, with specified minimum rent payments. fees vary by type of site, investment by the company and local business conditions. these fees, along with occupancy and operating rights, are stipulated in franchise agreements that generally have
20-year terms.   we manage the business based on geographic
segments: united states; europe; asia/pacific, the middle east and africa (apmea); latin america and canada. in addition, throughout this report we present a segment entitled other that includes non-mcdonalds brands. the u.s. and
europe segments account for approximately 70% of total revenues. france, germany and the united kingdom account for about 65% of europes revenues; australia, china and japan (a 50%-owned affiliate accounted for under the equity method) account
for about 45% of apmeas revenues; and brazil accounts for about 40% of latin americas revenues. these seven markets along with the u.s. and canada are referred to as major markets throughout this report and comprise
approximately 70% of total revenues.   in analyzing business
trends, management considers a variety of performance and financial measures including systemwide sales growth, comparable sales growth and company-operated margins. systemwide sales include sales by all restaurants, whether operated by the company,
by franchisees or by affiliates. while sales by franchisees and affiliates are not recorded as revenues by the company, management believes the information is important in understanding the companys financial performance because they are the
basis on which the company calculates and records franchised and affiliated revenues and are indicative of the financial health of our franchisee base. comparable sales are a key performance indicator used within the retail industry and are
indicative of acceptance of the companys initiatives as well as local economic and consumer trends. increases or decreases in comparable sales represent the percent change in constant currency sales from the same period in the prior year for
all systemwide restaurants in operation at least thirteen months. constant currency results exclude the effects of foreign currency translation and are calculated by translating current year results at prior year average exchange rates. management
reviews and analyzes business results in constant currencies and bases certain compensation plans on these results because the company believes they better represent the underlying business trends.   strategic direction and 2003 financial performance
in 2001 and 2002, the companys results reflected a focus on growth
through adding new restaurants, with associated high levels of capital expenditures and increasing levels of debt financing. this strategy, combined with challenging economic conditions and increased competition in certain key markets, adversely
affected results and returns on investment.   in 2003, the
company introduced a comprehensive revitalization plan to increase mcdonalds relevance to todays consumers as well as improve our financial discipline. we redefined our strategy to emphasize growth through adding more customers to
existing restaurants. in line with this, we took a more disciplined approach to capital allocation and put a greater emphasis on controlling expenses. we aligned the system around our customer-focused plan to win, designed to deliver operational
excellence and leadership marketing. this plan contains aggressive goals and measures for success based on the five drivers of exceptional customer experiencespeople, products, place, price and promotion.   our near-term goal was to fortify the foundation of our business. our
long-term goal is to create a differentiated customer experienceone that builds brand loyaltyand enables us to deliver attractive top- and bottom-line growth and returns on a sustained basis. for 2005 and beyond, mcdonalds is
targeting annual systemwide sales and revenue growth of 3 percent to 5 percent, annual operating income growth of 6 percent to 7 percent and annual returns on incremental invested capital in the high teens. (return on incremental invested capital is
the change in operating income plus depreciation divided by the change in gross assets.) these targets exclude the impact of foreign currency translation.   we made significant progress in 2003 in operational excellence and leadership marketing. we improved our core menu and added several successful new
products. we used more consistent, rigorous measurements such as evaluations by company personnel, independent mystery shoppers and customer research to evaluate restaurant performance. using this information, along with enhanced training and other
processes, we have strengthened our operations. we have expanded our everyday value offerings, attracting more customer visits. we began to create more relevant
mcdonalds corporation9
restaurant environments by updating, rebuilding and relocating some of our restaurants. we also introduced our first
global marketing strategy, embodied by the im lovin it theme, which emphasizes more contemporary music and images and is connecting with both our customers and our employees.   from a financial perspective, our results also improved in 2003. in concert
with the companys strategic shift to emphasize growth from existing restaurants, management is focusing in particular on comparable sales and company-operated margin trends, both of which gained momentum during the year. performance in the
u.s. was impressive, with robust annual comparable sales and margin increases. in europe, while comparable sales were slightly negative for the year, they improved sequentially each quarter, as did company-operated margins, compared with the prior
year. apmeas comparable sales and company-operated margins declined for the year, but both showed significant improvement in the second half.   as part of the companys revitalization plan, we eliminated projects not directly affecting our customers experience and narrowed
non-mcdonalds brand activities. these actions along with the write down of a portion of our goodwill and restaurant assets resulted in the company recording $408 million of pretax charges (primarily noncash) in 2003.   highlights from the year included:
comparable sales increased 2.4%, a significant improvement over the 2.1% decline in 2002.
consolidated revenues increased 11% to a new record high of $17 billion. excluding the positive impact of currency translation, revenues increased 6%.
systemwide sales increased 11%. excluding the positive impact of currency translation, systemwide sales increased 5%.
net income per common share totaled $1.15, compared with $0.70 in 2002.
company-operated margins as a percent of sales improved 10 basis points, progressing toward our goal of increasing margins by 35 basis points per year beginning in 2005.
cash from operations increased $400 million to $3.3 billion, primarily driven by higher sales at existing restaurants and stronger foreign currencies.
capital expenditures were reduced by $700 million to $1.3 billion.
debt pay-down totaled approximately $900 million.
the annual dividend increased 70% to more than $500 million.
share repurchases totaled about $440 million.   outlook for 2004   we expect 2004 to be a year of ongoing progress in operational excellence, leadership marketing and key financial metrics. we will continue to focus our revitalization
efforts on improving our customers experiences by providing better service, enhancing food taste, menu variety and value offerings, and creating more relevant marketing. while we are confident in our plans for 2004, we also are conscious of
the challenges we face. for example, we must continue to deliver solid results in the u.s., a very competitive marketplace, despite sequentially more difficult sales comparisons. we believe that the combination of initiatives that benefited our u.s.
business in 2003 will continue to create positive momentum in 2004.   outside the u.s., some key markets must increase customer relevance, while others have economic challenges. we believe that we are in a better position to overcome these issues today than we have been for some time. our plan is to leverage
successes in the u.s. and other markets like australiasuch as more relevant menus, strong value platforms, creative marketing and better restaurant-level executionto improve results in additional markets around the world.   while the company does not provide specific guidance on earnings per share,
the following information is provided to assist in analyzing the companys results.
changes in constant currency systemwide sales are driven by restaurant unit expansion and changes in comparable sales. the company expects net restaurant additions to add
approximately one percentage point to sales and operating income growth in 2004 (in constant currencies). most of this anticipated growth will result from restaurants opened in 2003. the company does not provide specific guidance on changes in
comparable sales. however, as a perspective, assuming no change in cost structure a one percentage point increase in u.s. comparable sales would impact annual earnings per share by about 2 cents. similarly, an increase of one percentage point in
europes comparable sales would impact annual earnings per share by about 1.5 cents.
the company expects full year 2004 selling, general & administrative expenses to be relatively flat to up slightly in constant currencies and to decline as a percent of revenues
and systemwide sales, compared with 2003. however, due to the timing of certain expenses, the company expects selling, general & administrative expenses to increase in the first half of 2004 and to decline in the second half, compared with 2003.
a significant part of the companys operating income is from outside the u.s., and more than 70% of its total debt is denominated in foreign currencies. accordingly, earnings
are affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly the euro and the british pound. if the euro and the british pound both move 10% in the same direction (compared with 2003 average rates),
10mcdonalds corporation
the companys annual earnings per share would change by about 5 cents to 6 cents. in 2003, foreign currency translation benefited earnings per share by 7 cents.
for 2004, the company expects its net debt principal repayments to be approximately $400 million to $700 million. however, despite lower average debt balances, the company expects
interest expense to be relatively flat compared with 2003 due to stronger foreign currencies.
the company expects the effective income tax rate for 2004 to be between 32.5% and 33.5%.
the company expects capital expenditures for 2004 to be approximately $1.5 billion to $1.6 billion.
the company expects to return about $1 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases in 2004.   a number of factors can affect our business, including effectiveness of
operating initiatives and changes in global and local business and economic conditions. these and other risks are noted in the forward-looking statements at the end of managements discussion and analysis.   consolidated operating results

not meaningful.   strategic actions   in 2003, the company eliminated projects not directly impacting its customers experience, narrowed its non-mcdonalds brand activities, aligned its system
around a single action plan (plan to win), and re-established mcdonalds marketing leadership through the introduction of its first ever global brand strategy embodied by the im lovin it theme. these actions were
consistent with managements strategy of concentrating the companys capital and resources on the best near-term opportunities and avoiding those that distract from restaurant-level execution.   in 2002, the company initiated actions designed to optimize restaurant
operations and improve the business. they included the restructuring of certain international markets, the closing of a significant number of underperforming restaurants, the decision to terminate a long-term technology project, and the
consolidation of certain home office facilities and elimination of positions to control costs, streamline operations and reallocate resources.
mcdonalds corporation11
in 2001, the company also implemented structural changes and restaurant initiatives, primarily in the
u.s. the changes included streamlining operations by reducing the number of u.s. regions and divisions, enabling the company to combine staff functions and improve efficiency.   the company recorded charges associated with certain of the above actions as special items. special items
generally represent actions or transactions related to the implementation of strategic initiatives of the company, items that are unusual or infrequent in nature (such as the dispositions of certain non-mcdonalds brands in 2003 and the japan
ipo gain in 2001), and charges resulting from annual goodwill and asset impairment testing. mcdonalds management does not include these items when reviewing business performance trends because they do not believe these items are indicative of
expected ongoing results.   on a pretax basis, the company
recorded $408 million of special charges in 2003, $853 million of special charges in 2002 and $253 million of special items in 2001. all special items were recorded in other operating expense, except as noted in the discussion that follows.

certain special items were not tax-effected.   restructuring   in 2003, the company recorded $272 million of pretax charges consisting of: $237 million related to the loss on the sale of donatos pizzeria, the closing of all donatos
and boston market restaurants outside the u.s. and the exit of a domestic joint venture with fazolis; and $35 million related to revitalization plan actions of mcdonalds japan, including headcount reductions, the closing of pret a manger
stores in japan, and the early termination of a long-term management services agreement.   in 2002, the company recorded $267 million of net pretax charges consisting of: $201 million related to the anticipated transfer of ownership in five countries in the middle east and latin america to developmental
licensees and ceasing operations in two countries in latin america; $81 million primarily related to eliminating approximately 600 positions (about half of which were in the u.s. and half of which were in international markets), reallocating
resources and consolidating certain home office facilities to control costs; and a $15 million favorable adjustment to the 2001 restructuring charge due to lower employee-related costs than originally anticipated. under the developmental license
business structure, which the company successfully employs in about 30 markets outside the u.s. (approximately 400 restaurants), the licensee owns the business, including the real estate interest. while the company generally does not have any
capital invested in these markets, it receives a royalty based on a percent of sales.   in 2001, the company recorded $200 million of pretax restructuring charges related to initiatives designed to improve the restaurant experience, primarily in the u.s. these initiatives included streamlining operations
by reducing the number of regions and divisions, enabling the company to combine staff functions and improve efficiency. in connection with these initiatives, the company eliminated approximately 850 positions (700 in the u.s., primarily in the
divisions and regions, and 150 in international markets).   restaurant closings/asset impairment   in 2003, the company recorded $136 million of net pretax charges consisting of: $148 million primarily related to asset/goodwill impairment, mainly in latin america; $30 million for about 50 restaurant closings associated with strategic
actions in latin america; and a $42 million favorable adjustment to the 2002 charge for restaurant closings, primarily due to about 85 fewer closings than originally anticipated. the lower closings were primarily due to managements
reassessment of the plans as a result of the new strategic direction of the company.   in 2002, the company recorded $402 million of pretax charges consisting of: $302 million related to managements decision to close 751 underperforming restaurants primarily in the u.s. and japan; and $100 million primarily related to
the impairment of assets for certain existing restaurants in europe and latin america. most of the restaurants identified for closing had negative cash flows and/or very low annual sales volumes. also, in many cases they would have required
significant capital investment to remain financially viable.
12mcdonalds corporation
in 2001, the company recorded $135 million of pretax charges consisting of: $91 million related to the
closing of 163 underperforming restaurants in international markets; a $24 million asset impairment charge in turkey; and $20 million related to the disposition of aroma caf in the u.k.   although restaurant closings occur each year, these restaurant closing
charges in each year were identified as special charges because they were the result of separate intensive reviews by management in conjunction with other strategic actions.   other   in 2002, the company recorded $184 million of pretax charges consisting of: $170 million primarily related to the write-off of software development costs as a result of
managements decision to terminate a long-term technology project; and $14 million primarily related to the write-off of receivables and inventory in venezuela as a result of the temporary closure of all mcdonalds restaurants due to a
national strike. although the terminated technology project was expected to deliver long-term benefits, it was no longer viewed as the best use of capital, as the anticipated systemwide cost over several years was expected to be more than $1
billion.   in 2001, the company recorded $55 million of pretax
charges consisting of: $18 million primarily related to the write-off of certain technology costs; $12 million (recorded in nonoperating expense) primarily related to the write-off of a corporate investment; and $25 million primarily related to the
unrecoverable costs incurred in connection with the theft of winning game pieces from the companys monopoly and certain other promotional games over an extended period of time, and the related termination of the supplier of the game pieces.
fifty individuals (none of whom were company employees) were convicted of conspiracy and/or mail fraud charges.   mcdonalds japan ipo gain   in 2001, mcdonalds japan, the companys 50%-owned affiliate, completed an ipo of 12 million shares. the company recorded a $137 million gain (pre and after
tax) in nonoperating income to reflect an increase in the carrying value of its investment as a result of the cash proceeds from the ipo received by mcdonalds japan.   impact of foreign currencies on reported results   while changing foreign currencies affect reported results, mcdonalds lessens
exposures, where practical, by financing in local currencies, hedging certain foreign-denominated cash flows, and by purchasing goods and services in local currencies.   in 2003, foreign currency translation had a positive impact on consolidated revenues, operating income and earnings per
share due to the strengthening of several major currencies, primarily the euro. in 2002, foreign currency translation had a minimal impact on revenues as the stronger euro and british pound were offset by weaker latin american currencies (primarily
the argentine peso, brazilian real and venezuelan bolivar). operating income in 2002 was positively impacted by foreign currency translation primarily due to the stronger euro and british pound.   impact of foreign currency translation on reported results

in the u.s., ongoing
menu, service and value initiatives drove the increase in revenues in 2003 as the u.s. achieved its highest annual comparable sales increase since 1987. these initiatives included the introduction of premium salads and mcgriddles breakfast
sandwiches, the dollar menu, extended hours, a heightened focus on operations, more disciplined measurements and a new marketing direction. results also reflected improvement in the u.s. economy in 2003. in 2002, revenues increased slightly due to
restaurant expansion. results in 2002, in part, reflected the overall slowdown in the restaurant industry and increased competition.   in 2003 and 2002, europes revenues reflected strong performance in russia driven by expansion and positive comparable sales, along with expansion in
france. these results were partly offset by weak results in the u.k. and germany, although germanys performance improved in the second half of 2003.   in 2003 and 2002, apmeas revenues benefited from positive comparable sales in australia and expansion in china. revenues were negatively affected in
2003 by weak results in hong kong, south korea and taiwan, compounded by consumer concerns about severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars) in several markets in the first half of the year. in addition, japan had negative comparable sales for 2003 and
2002, although the markets performance improved in the fourth quarter of 2003. in 2002, revenues reflected a benefit from the restructuring of our ownership in the philippines, effective july 2001, that resulted in the reclassification of
franchised restaurants to company-operated.   in latin america,
revenues in 2003 increased in constant currencies primarily due to a higher percentage of company-operated restaurants. the increase in revenues in 2002 was primarily due to positive comparable sales in brazil and expansion in mexico.

bracketed amounts resulted from favorable adjustments to 2002 charges primarily due to fewer than anticipated restaurant closings.   in 2003, u.s. operating income included higher combined operating margin
dollars, higher selling, general & administrative expenses and higher other operating expenses (excluding special charges). u.s. operating income in 2002 included lower combined operating margin dollars, lower selling, general &
administrative expenses and lower other operating income (excluding special charges).   europes constant currency results in 2003 and 2002 benefited from strong performances in france and russia. however, difficult economic conditions in germany and weak results in the u.k. negatively impacted
results in both years. despite the difficult economic conditions, germanys performance improved in the second half of 2003.   apmeas constant currency results in 2003 reflected strong results in australia. however, weak results in most other markets, compounded by concerns
about sars in certain markets, negatively impacted the segment. in 2002, strong results in australia were more than offset by weak results in japan and hong kong.   latin americas operating income in constant currencies significantly declined in both 2003 and 2002 due to the
continuing difficult economic conditions experienced by several key markets in the segment. in addition, latin americas results for both years were negatively impacted by higher provisions for uncollectible receivables. the company is
currently in litigation with about one-third of the franchisees in brazil, which is negatively impacting the companys results in latin america. we expect this to continue in the near term.

operating margins   operating margin information and discussions relate to mcdonalds restaurants only and exclude non-mcdonalds brands.
company-operated margins   company-operated margin dollars represent sales by company-operated restaurants less the
operating costs of these restaurants. company-operated margin dollars increased $182 million or 12% (5% in constant currencies) in 2003 and declined $12 million or 1% (3% in constant currencies) in 2002. the constant currency increase in 2003 was
primarily due to strong comparable sales in the u.s. the constant currency decrease in 2002 was primarily due to negative comparable sales and higher labor rates, partly offset by restaurant expansion.   company-operated marginsmcdonalds restaurants

operating cost trends
as a percent of sales were as follows: food & paper costs decreased in 2003 and 2002, payroll costs were flat in 2003 and increased in 2002, and occupancy & other operating expenses increased in both years.   the u.s. company-operated margin percent increased in 2003 primarily due to
positive comparable sales and lower payroll as a percent of sales due to improved productivity and lower wage inflation. higher commodity costs partly offset these trends. in 2002, the u.s. company-operated margin percent benefited from the
elimination of goodwill amortization and a lower advertising contribution rate, while weak comparable sales and higher labor costs negatively impacted the margin.   in 2003, europes company-operated margin percent reflected weak performance in the u.k. (which has the largest number
of company-operated restaurants in europe), partly offset by improved margin performance in germany and france. in 2002, europes company-operated margin percent reflected higher labor costs and an increase in occupancy & other operating
expenses.   franchised margins   franchised margin dollars represent revenues from franchised and affiliated restaurants less
the companys occupancy costs (rent and depreciation) associated with those sites. franchised margin dollars represented more than 65% of the combined operating margins in 2003, 2002 and 2001. franchised margin dollars increased $341 million or
11% (5% in constant currencies) in 2003 and $36 million or 1% (flat in constant currencies) in 2002.   franchised marginsmcdonalds restaurants

the consolidated
franchised margin percent declined slightly in 2003 as positive comparable sales were offset by higher occupancy costs, due in part to an increased proportion of leased sites. the decline in the consolidated franchised margin percent in 2002
reflected negative comparable sales, higher rent assistance to franchisees primarily in the u.s. and europe, and higher occupancy costs, due in part to an increased proportion of leased sites.   selling, general & administrative expenses
consolidated selling, general & administrative expenses increased 7% in 2003 and 3%
in 2002 (3% and 4% in constant currencies). the constant currency increase in 2003 was primarily due to higher performance-based incentive compensation, as well as severance and other costs associated with the strategic decision to reduce restaurant
openings. the constant currency increase in 2002 was primarily due to higher spending on technology in the corporate segment, higher advertising expenses in the u.s. primarily related to the introduction of the dollar menu, and higher expenses for
non-mcdonalds brands.
mcdonalds corporation17
selling, general & administrative expenses as a percent of revenues declined to 10.7% in 2003
compared with 11.1% in 2002 and 11.2% in 2001, and selling, general & administrative expenses as a percent of systemwide sales declined to 4.0% in 2003 compared with 4.1% in 2002 and 2001. management believes that analyzing selling, general
& administrative expenses as a percent of systemwide sales as well as revenues is meaningful because these costs are incurred to support systemwide restaurants.   selling, general & administrative expenses

see other operating expense, net note to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the special charges and a summary of the activity in the related
liabilities.   gains on sales of restaurant businesses
gains on sales of restaurant businesses include gains from sales of
company-operated restaurants as well as gains from exercises of purchase options by franchisees with business facilities lease arrangements (arrangements where the company leases the businesses, including equipment, to franchisees who have options
to purchase the businesses). the companys purchases and sales of businesses with its franchisees and affiliates are aimed at achieving an optimal ownership mix in each market. resulting gains or losses are recorded in operating income because
the transactions are a recurring part of our business. the company expects lower gains on sales of restaurant businesses in 2004 compared with 2003.   equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates   equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliatesbusinesses in which the company actively participates but does not controlis reported after interest expense
and income taxes, except for u.s. restaurant partnerships, which are reported before income taxes. the increase in 2003 was primarily due to strong results in the u.s. the decrease in 2002 was due to a net loss from our japanese affiliate compared
with earnings in 2001.   other expense   other expense in 2003 reflected higher losses on asset dispositions, higher provisions for
uncollectible receivables (primarily in latin america), and costs in the u.s. related to sites that will no longer be developed as a result of managements decision to significantly reduce capital expenditures. other expense in 2002 reflected
payments to u.s. owner/operators to facilitate the introduction of a new front counter service system and higher provisions for uncollectible receivables (primarily in europe and latin america), partly offset by a benefit from the elimination of
goodwill amortization. the company expects lower other expense in 2004 compared with 2003.   interest expense   interest expense increased in 2003 due to stronger foreign currencies, partly offset by lower average debt levels and interest rates. interest expense decreased in 2002
due to lower average interest rates, partly offset by higher average debt levels and stronger foreign currencies.   nonoperating expense, net   nonoperating expense includes miscellaneous income and expense items such as interest income, minority interests, and gains and losses related to other investments,
financings and foreign currency translation. nonoperating expense in 2003 reflected an $11 million loss on the early extinguishment of $200 million of debt as well as higher foreign currency translation losses compared with 2002. nonoperating
expense in 2002 reflected higher minority interest expense and foreign currency translation losses in 2002 compared with foreign currency translation gains

in 2001. in addition, nonoperating expense in 2001 included $12 million primarily related to the write-off of a corporate
investment as well as minority interest expense related to the sale of real estate in singapore.   provision for income taxes   the following table presents the reported effective income tax rates as well as the effective income tax rates before special items.

(1) certain special items were not
tax-effected.   the 2001 effective income tax rate reflected
a benefit from the impact of tax law changes in certain international markets.   consolidated net deferred tax liabilities included tax assets, net of valuation allowance, of $1,032 million in 2003 and $867 million in 2002. substantially all of the net tax assets arose in the u.s. and other
profitable markets.   cumulative effect of
accounting changes   effective january 1, 2003, the company adopted sfas no.
143, accounting for asset retirement obligations, which requires legal obligations associated with the retirement of long-lived assets to be recognized at their fair value at the time that the obligations are incurred. effective january 1,
2002, the company adopted sfas no. 142, goodwill and other intangible assets, which eliminates the amortization of goodwill and instead subjects it to annual impairment tests. see summary of significant accounting policies note to the
consolidated financial statements for further discussion.   cash flows   the company generates
significant cash from operations and has substantial credit capacity to fund operating and discretionary spending. cash from operations totaled $3.3 billion and exceeded capital expenditures by $2.0 billion in 2003, while cash from operations
totaled $2.9 billion and exceeded capital expenditures by $0.9 billion in 2002. cash provided by operations, along with borrowings and other sources of cash, is used for capital expenditures, debt repayments, dividends and share repurchases.

in addition to its
cash provided by operations, the company can meet short-term funding needs through commercial paper borrowings and line of credit agreements. accordingly, the company purposefully maintains a relatively low current ratio, which was .76 at year-end
2003.   restaurant development and capital
expenditures   as a result of the company strategically shifting its focus from
adding new restaurants to building sales at existing restaurants, the company significantly reduced capital expenditures and restaurant openings in 2003 compared with 2002 and 2001.   in 2003, the company opened 513 traditional mcdonalds restaurants and 319 satellite restaurants (small, limited-menu
restaurants for which the land and building are generally leased), and closed 486 traditional restaurants and 184 satellite restaurants. in 2002, the company opened 1,247 traditional mcdonalds restaurants and 392 satellite restaurants, and
closed 474 traditional restaurants and 158 satellite restaurants. about 65% of mcdonalds restaurant additions occurred in the major markets in 2003.   systemwide restaurants at year end(1)

1,879; latin america20, 19, 46; and canada350, 330, 307.   in 2004, the company expects to open about 550 traditional mcdonalds restaurants and 300 satellite restaurants and close about 300 traditional restaurants and 100 satellite restaurants.   approximately 60% of company-operated restaurants and more than 85% of
franchised restaurants were located in the major markets at the end of 2003. franchisees and affiliates operated 73% of mcdonalds restaurants at year-end 2003. non-mcdonalds brand restaurants are primarily company-operated.
capital expenditures decreased $697 million or 35% in 2003 and increased
$98 million or 5% in 2002. the decrease in capital expenditures in 2003 was primarily due to lower restaurant openings, consistent with our shift in strategic focus, partly offset by stronger foreign currencies (foreign currency translation
increased capital expenditures by $73 million). the increase in 2002 was primarily due to higher spending in the u.s. and canada, partly offset by lower capital expenditures for new restaurants in latin america. capital expenditures for

in 2003, 2002 and 2001 reflected the leasing of a higher proportion of new sites and a program that gave u.s. franchisees
the option to purchase new restaurant buildings.   during 2003,
the company began to phase out the option for u.s. franchisees to purchase new restaurant buildings. consequently, the company is currently purchasing most buildings and, as a result, collects additional rent from the franchisees.   capital expenditures invested in major markets excluding japan represented
approximately 70% of the total in 2003 and 2002 and 60% in 2001. japan is accounted for under the equity method, and accordingly its capital expenditures are not included in consolidated amounts.   capital expenditures

includes technology to improve service and food quality and enhancements to facilities to achieve higher levels of customer satisfaction.

primarily computer equipment and furnishings for office buildings.   capital expenditures for new restaurants decreased $544 million or 47% in 2003 because the company opened fewer restaurants and concentrated new
restaurant investments in markets with acceptable returns or opportunities for long-term growth. while capital expenditures for existing restaurants decreased in 2003, they increased as a percentage of total capital spending. this is due to the
companys focus on growing sales at existing restaurants including reinvestment initiatives such as restaurant reimaging in several markets around the world, including the u.s.   average development costs vary widely by market depending on the types of restaurants built and the real estate and
construction costs within each market. these costs, which include land, buildings and equipment owned by the company, are managed through the use of optimally sized restaurants, construction and design efficiencies, standardization and global
sourcing. in addition, foreign currency fluctuations affect average development costs. in 2004, the company is targeting eleven consolidated markets, including the u.s., for opening ten or more restaurants. although the company is not responsible
for all costs on every restaurant opened, in 2003 total development costs (consisting of land, buildings and equipment) for new traditional mcdonalds restaurants averaged approximately $1.8 million in the u.s. and approximately $1.7 million in
the ten markets outside the u.s.   the company and its
affiliates owned about 37% of the land and 60% of the buildings for its restaurants at year-end 2003 and 2002.   share repurchases and dividends   during 2003, the company acquired 18.9 million shares of mcdonalds stock for approximately $439 million under a $5.0 billion share repurchase program authorized in
2001. through 2003, 39.0 million shares for $975 million have been repurchased under this program.   the company has paid dividends on its common stock for 28 consecutive years and has increased the dividend amount every year. in 2003, the company
declared a 70% increase in the annual dividend to $504 million, reflecting the companys confidence in the ongoing strength and reliability of its cash flow, the positive results from its revitalization efforts and favorable changes in the u.s.
tax law. as in the past, future dividends will be considered after reviewing returns to shareholders, profitability expectations and financing needs and will be declared at the discretion of the board of directors. cash dividends are declared and
paid on an annual basis.   financial position and capital resources   total assets and returns   total assets grew by
$1.6 billion or 6% in 2003 and $1.4 billion or 6% in 2002. changes in foreign currency exchange rates increased total assets by approximately $1.9 billion in 2003 and $785 million in 2002. at year-end 2003 and 2002, approximately 65% of consolidated
assets was located in the major markets excluding japan. net property and equipment rose $1.3 billion in 2003 and represented 78% of total assets at year end.
operating income is used to compute return on average assets, while income before the cumulative effect of accounting changes is used to calculate
return on average common equity. month-end balances are used to compute both average assets and average common equity.   returns on assets and equity

return on average assets and return on average common equity both began to stabilize due to strong operating results in the u.s., partly offset by continued weak operating results in most markets in apmea and latin america. in 2002, return on
average assets and return on average common equity both declined, primarily due to weak operating results in apmea and latin america. during 2004, the company will continue to concentrate mcdonalds restaurant openings and new capital invested
in markets with acceptable returns or opportunities for long-term growth.

financings and market risk   the company generally borrows on a long-term basis and is exposed to the impact of interest
rate changes and foreign currency fluctuations. debt obligations at december 31, 2003 totaled $9.7 billion compared with $10.0 billion at december 31, 2002. the net decrease in 2003 was due to net payments ($892 million) and sfas no. 133 noncash
fair value adjustments ($44 million), partly offset by the impact of changes in exchange rates on foreign currency denominated debt ($686 million).   debt highlights(1)

includes the effect of interest rate and foreign currency exchange agreements.   moodys, standard & poors and fitch currently rate mcdonalds commercial paper p-1, a-1 and f1; and its
long-term debt a2, a and a, respectively. historically the company has not experienced difficulty in obtaining financing or refinancing existing debt. the companys key metrics for monitoring its credit structure are shown in the preceding
table. while the company targets these metrics for ease of focus, it also looks at similar credit ratios that incorporate capitalized operating leases to estimate total adjusted debt using a multiple of eight times rent expense after considering
certain adjustments to more accurately reflect its total aggregate lease commitments. these adjustments include: excluding percent rents in excess of minimum rents; excluding certain company-operated restaurant lease agreements outside the u.s. that
are cancelable with minimal penalties (representing approximately 20% of company-operated restaurant leases outside the u.s., based on the companys estimate); capitalizing non-restaurant leases using a multiple of three times rent expense; and
reducing total rent expense by approximately half of the annual minimum rent payments due to the company from franchisees operating on leased sites.   certain of the companys debt obligations contain cross-acceleration provisions and restrictions on company and subsidiary mortgages and the
long-term debt of certain subsidiaries. there are no provisions in the companys debt obligations that would accelerate repayment of debt as a result of a change in credit ratings or a material adverse change in the companys business. the
company has $1.3 billion available under committed line of credit agreements (see debt financing note to the consolidated financial statements) as well as $1.6 billion under a u.s. shelf registration and $607 million under a euro medium-term notes
program for future debt issuance.   the company uses major
capital markets, bank financings and derivatives to meet its financing requirements and reduce interest expense. the company manages its debt portfolio in response to changes in interest rates and foreign currency rates by periodically retiring,
redeeming and repurchasing debt, terminating exchange agreements and using derivatives. the company does not use derivatives with a level of complexity or with a risk higher than the exposures to be hedged and does not hold or issue derivatives for
trading purposes. all exchange agreements are over-the-counter instruments.   in managing the impact of interest rate changes and foreign currency fluctuations, the company uses interest rate exchange agreements and finances in the currencies in which assets are denominated. all derivatives
were recorded at fair value in the companys consolidated balance sheet at december 31, 2003 and 2002 as follows: miscellaneous other assets$102 million and $134 million; other long-term liabilities (excluding interest)$136 million
and $39 million; and accrued payroll and other liabilities$29 million and $24 million. see summary of significant accounting policies note to the consolidated financial statements related to financial instruments for additional information
regarding their use and the impact of sfas no.133 regarding derivatives.   the company uses foreign currency debt and derivatives to hedge the foreign currency risk associated with certain royalties, intercompany financings and long-term investments in foreign subsidiaries and affiliates.
this reduces the impact of fluctuating foreign currencies on cash flows and shareholders equity. total foreign currency denominated debt, including the effects of foreign currency exchange agreements, was $6.8 billion at year-end 2003 and $6.2
billion at year-end 2002. in addition, where practical, mcdonalds restaurants purchase goods and services in local currencies resulting in natural hedges.
the company does not have significant exposure to any individual counterparty and has master agreements that contain netting arrangements. certain of
these agreements also require each party to post collateral if credit ratings fall below, or aggregate exposures exceed, certain contractual limits. at december 31, 2003, the company was required to post collateral of $11.6 million, and at december
31, 2002, collateral of $2.2 million was posted by a counterparty.   the companys net asset exposure is diversified among a broad basket of currencies. the companys largest net asset exposures (defined as foreign currency assets less foreign currency liabilities) at year end were as follows:

the company prepared sensitivity analyses of its financial instruments to determine the impact of
hypothetical changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates on the companys results of operations, cash flows and the fair value of its financial instruments. the interest rate analysis assumed a one percentage point adverse
change in interest rates on all financial instruments but did not consider the effects of the reduced level of economic activity that could exist in such an environment. the foreign currency rate analysis assumed that each foreign currency rate
would change by 10% in the same direction relative to the u.s. dollar on all financial instruments; however, the analysis did not include the potential impact on sales levels or local currency prices or the effect of fluctuating currencies on the
companys anticipated foreign currency royalties and other payments received in the u.s. based on the results of these analyses of the companys financial instruments, neither a one percentage point adverse change in interest rates from
2003 levels nor a 10% adverse change in foreign currency rates from 2003 levels would materially affect the companys results of operations, cash flows or the fair value of its financial instruments.   contractual obligations and commitments   the company has long-term contractual obligations primarily in the form of lease obligations
(related to both company-operated and franchised restaurants) and debt obligations. in addition, the company has long-term revenue and cash flow streams that relate to its franchise arrangements. cash provided by operations (including cash provided
by these franchise arrangements) along with the companys borrowing capacity and other sources of cash will be used to satisfy the obligations. the following table summarizes the companys contractual obligations and their aggregate
maturities as well as future minimum rent payments due to the company under existing franchise arrangements as of december 31, 2003. (see discussions of cash flows, financial position and capital resources as well as the notes to the december 31,

the maturities reflect reclassifications of short-term obligations to long-term obligations of $750 million in 2006 and $500 million thereafter, as they are supported by
long-term line of credit agreements. debt obligations do not include $321 million of sfas no.133 noncash fair value adjustments.   the company maintains a nonqualified, unfunded supplemental plan that allows participants to make tax-deferred contributions and receive company-provided
allocations that cannot be made under the profit sharing and savings plan because of internal revenue service limitations. the investment alternatives and returns in the supplemental plan are based on certain market-rate investment alternatives
under the profit sharing and savings plan. total liabilities under the supplemental plan were $329 million at december 31, 2003 and $297 million at december 31, 2002, and were included in other long-term liabilities in the consolidated balance
sheet.   in addition to long-term obligations, the company had
guaranteed certain affiliate and other loans totaling $89 million at december 31, 2003.   other matters   critical accounting policies and estimates   managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon the companys consolidated financial statements, which have
been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the u.s. the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities,
revenues and expenses as well as related disclosures. on an ongoing basis, the company evaluates its estimates and judgments based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. actual
results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.   the company reviews its financial reporting and disclosure practices and accounting policies quarterly to ensure that they provide accurate and transparent information relative to the current economic and business
environment. the company believes that of its significant accounting policies the following involve a higher degree of judgment and/or complexity.   property and equipment   property and equipment are depreciated or amortized on a straight-line basis over their useful lives based on managements estimates of the period over which the
assets will generate revenue. the useful lives are estimated based on historical experience with similar assets, taking into account anticipated technological or other changes. the company periodically reviews these lives relative to physical
factors, economic factors and industry trends. if there are changes in the planned use of property and equipment or if technological changes occur more rapidly than anticipated, the useful lives assigned to these assets may need to be shortened,
resulting in the recognition of increased depreciation and amortization expense in future periods.

long-lived assets   long-lived assets (including goodwill) are reviewed for impairment annually in the fourth quarter and whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. in assessing the recoverability of the companys long-lived assets, the company considers changes in economic conditions and makes assumptions regarding
estimated future cash flows and other factors. (the biggest assumption impacting estimated future cash flows is the estimated change in comparable sales.) estimates of future cash flows are highly subjective judgments based on the companys
experience and knowledge of operations. these estimates can be significantly impacted by many factors including changes in global and local business and economic conditions, operating costs, inflation, competition, and consumer and demographic
trends. if the companys estimates or underlying assumptions change in the future, the company may be required to record impairment charges.   restructuring and litigation accruals   the company has recorded charges related to restructuring markets, closing restaurants, eliminating positions and other strategic changes. the accruals recorded included
estimates pertaining to employee termination costs, number of restaurants to be closed and remaining lease obligations for closed facilities. although the company does not anticipate significant changes, the actual costs may differ from these
estimates.   from time to time, the company is subject to
proceedings, lawsuits and other claims related to franchisees, suppliers, employees, customers, competitors and intellectual property. the company is required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as
potential ranges of probable losses. a determination of the amount of accrual required, if any, for these contingencies is made after careful analysis of each matter. the required accrual may change in the future due to new developments in each
matter or changes in approach such as a change in settlement strategy in dealing with these matters. the company does not believe that any such matter will have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations.
income taxes   the company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets if it is more
likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred assets will not be realized. while the company has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance, if these
estimates and assumptions change in the future, the company may be required to adjust its valuation allowance. this could result in a charge to, or an increase in, income in the period such determination is made.   deferred u.s. income taxes have not been recorded for basis differences
totaling $4.2 billion related to investments in certain foreign subsidiaries or affiliates. the basis differences consist primarily of undistributed earnings considered permanently invested in the businesses. if managements intentions change
in the future, deferred taxes may need to be provided.   in
addition, the company operates within multiple taxing jurisdictions and is subject to audit in these jurisdictions. the company records accruals for the estimated outcomes of these audits, and the accruals may change in the future due to new
developments in each matter.   effects of
changing prices  inflation   the company has demonstrated an ability to
manage inflationary cost increases effectively. this is because of rapid inventory turnover, the ability to adjust menu prices, cost controls and substantial property holdingsmany of which are at fixed costs and partly financed by debt made
less expensive by inflation.   forward-looking
statements   certain forward-looking statements are included in this report.
they use such words as may, will, expect, believe, plan and other similar terminology. these statements reflect managements current expectations regarding future events and operating
performance and speak only as of the date of this report. these forward-looking statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties. the following are some of the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed
in or underlying our forward-looking statements: effectiveness of operating initiatives; success in advertising and promotional efforts; changes in global and local business and economic conditions, including their impact on consumer confidence;
fluctuations in currency exchange and interest rates; food, labor and other operating costs; political or economic instability in local markets, including the effects of war and terrorist activities; competition, including pricing and marketing
initiatives and new product offerings by the companys competitors; consumer preferences or perceptions concerning the companys product offerings; spending patterns and demographic trends; availability of qualified restaurant personnel;
severe weather conditions; existence of positive or negative publicity regarding the company or its industry generally; effects of legal claims; cost and deployment of capital; changes in future effective tax rates; changes in governmental
regulations; and changes in applicable accounting policies and practices. the foregoing list of important factors is not all-inclusive.   the company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or
otherwise.

28mcdonalds corporation
notes to consolidated financial statements   summary of significant accounting policies   nature of business   the company primarily operates and franchises mcdonalds restaurants in the food service industry. the company also operates boston market and chipotle mexican grill
in the u.s. and has a minority ownership in u.k.-based pret a manger. in december 2003, the company sold its donatos pizzeria business.   all restaurants are operated either by the company, by independent entrepreneurs under the terms of franchise arrangements (franchisees), or by affiliates
operating under license agreements.   consolidation   the consolidated financial statements include the
accounts of the company and its subsidiaries. substantially all investments in affiliates owned 50% or less (primarily mcdonalds japan) are accounted for by the equity method.   estimates in financial statements   the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the u.s. requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. actual results could differ from those estimates.
revenue recognition   the companys revenues consist of sales by company-operated restaurants and fees from restaurants operated by franchisees and affiliates. sales by company-operated
restaurants are recognized on a cash basis. fees from franchised and affiliated restaurants include continuing rent and service fees, initial fees and royalties received from foreign affiliates and developmental licensees. continuing fees and
royalties are recognized in the period earned. initial fees are recognized upon opening of a restaurant, which is when the company has performed substantially all initial services required by the franchise arrangement.   foreign currency translation   the functional currency of substantially all operations outside the u.s. is the respective
local currency, except for a small number of countries with hyperinflationary economies, where the functional currency is the u.s. dollar.   advertising costs   advertising costs included in costs of company-operated restaurants primarily consist of contributions to advertising cooperatives and were (in millions): 2003$596.7; 2002$532.3; 2001$521.5.
production costs for radio and television advertising, primarily in the u.s., are expensed when the commercials are initially aired. these production costs as well as other marketing-related expenses included in selling, general & administrative
expenses were (in millions): 2003$113.1; 2002$115.3; 2001$79.4. in addition, significant advertising costs are incurred by franchisees through advertising cooperatives in individual markets.   stock-based compensation   the company accounts for all stock-based compensation as prescribed by accounting principles
board opinion no. 25. the company discloses pro forma net income and net income per common share, as provided by statement of financial accounting standards (sfas) no. 123, as amended by sfas no. 148, accounting for stock-based compensation.
the pro forma information was determined as if the company had
accounted for its employee stock options under the fair value method of sfas no. 123. the fair value of these options was estimated at the date of grant using an option pricing model. the model was designed to estimate the fair value of
exchange-traded options that, unlike employee stock options, can be traded at any time and are fully transferable. in addition, such models require the input of highly subjective assumptions including the expected volatility of the stock price. for
pro forma disclosures, the options estimated fair value was amortized over their vesting period. the following tables present the pro forma disclosures and the weighted-average assumptions used to estimate the fair value of these options.

property and equipment   property and equipment are stated at cost, with depreciation and amortization provided using the straight-line method over the following
estimated useful lives: buildingsup to 40 years; leasehold improvementsthe lesser of useful lives of assets or lease terms including option periods; and equipmentthree to 12 years.   goodwill   goodwill represents the excess of cost over the net tangible assets of acquired restaurant
businesses. the companys goodwill primarily consists of amounts paid in excess of net tangible assets for purchases of mcdonalds restaurants from franchisees and ownership increases in international subsidiaries or affiliates.
in 2001, the financial accounting standards board issued sfas
no. 141, business combinations, and no. 142, goodwill and other intangible assets. sfas no. 141 requires that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations initiated after june 30, 2001 and includes guidance
on the initial recognition and measurement of goodwill and other intangible assets arising from business combinations. sfas no. 142, effective january 1, 2002, eliminates the amortization of goodwill (and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite
lives) and instead subjects it to annual impairment tests. other intangible assets continue to be amortized over their useful lives. application of the nonamortization provisions of sfas no. 142 in 2001 would have increased net income by
approximately $30 million ($0.02 per share).   under sfas no.
142, goodwill is generally assigned to the reporting units expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. if a company-operated restaurant is sold within 24 months of acquisition, the goodwill associated with the acquisition is written
off in its entirety. if a restaurant is sold beyond 24 months from the acquisition, the amount of goodwill written off is based on the relative fair value of the business sold compared to the portion of the reporting unit (defined as each individual
country for mcdonalds restaurant business as well as each individual non-mcdonalds brand) that will be retained.   the annual goodwill impairment test compares the fair value of a reporting unit, generally based on discounted future cash flows, with its carrying amount
including goodwill. if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is measured as the difference between the fair value of the reporting units goodwill and the carrying amount of goodwill.   the company performed the initial required goodwill impairment test as of
january 1, 2002 and recorded a noncash charge of $98.6 million after tax ($0.07 per diluted share) for the cumulative effect of this accounting change. the impaired goodwill resulted primarily from businesses in argentina, uruguay and other markets
in latin america and the middle east, where economies had weakened significantly in recent years.   the following table presents the 2003 activity in goodwill by segment.

other represents non-mcdonalds brands.   long-lived assets   in accordance with sfas no. 144, accounting for the impairment or disposal of long-lived assets, long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment annually in the
fourth quarter and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. for purposes of annually reviewing mcdonalds restaurant assets for potential impairment, assets are initially
grouped together at a television market level in the u.s. and at a country level for each of the international markets. if an indicator of impairment (e.g., negative operating cash flows for the most recent trailing twelve-month period) exists for
any grouping of assets, an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows produced by each individual restaurant within the asset grouping is compared to its carrying value. if an asset is determined to be impaired, the loss is measured by the excess of
the carrying amount of the asset over its fair value as determined by an estimate of discounted future cash flows.   losses on assets held for disposal are recognized when management has approved and committed to a plan to dispose of the assets, and the assets are
available for disposal. generally, such losses relate to either restaurants that have closed and ceased operations or businesses or restaurants that are available for sale.
30mcdonalds corporation
financial instruments   the company generally borrows on a long-term basis and is exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and foreign currency fluctuations.
the company uses foreign currency denominated debt and derivative instruments to manage the impact of these changes. the company does not use derivatives with a level of complexity or with a risk higher than the exposures to be hedged and does not
hold or issue derivatives for trading purposes.   the
counterparties to these agreements consist of a diverse group of financial institutions. the company continually monitors its positions and the credit ratings of its counter-parties and adjusts positions as appropriate. the company did not have
significant exposure to any individual counter-party at december 31, 2003 and has master agreements that contain netting arrangements. certain of these agreements also require each party to post collateral if credit ratings fall below or aggregate
exposures exceed certain contractual limits. at december 31, 2003, the company was required to post collateral of $11.6 million, and at december 31, 2002, collateral of $2.2 million was posted by a counterparty.   effective january 1, 2001, the company adopted sfas no. 133, accounting
for derivative instruments and hedging activities, as amended. sfas no. 133 requires companies to recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the balance sheet at fair value. sfas no. 133 also requires companies to designate all
derivatives that qualify as hedging instruments as either fair value hedges, cash flow hedges or hedges of net investments in foreign operations. this designation is based upon the exposure being hedged.   the company recorded a transition adjustment at january 1, 2001 related to
cash flow hedges, which reduced accumulated other comprehensive income in shareholders equity by $17.0 million, after tax. this adjustment was primarily related to interest rate exchange agreements used to lock in long-term borrowing rates.
the cumulative effect of adopting sfas no. 133 at january 1, 2001 was not material to the companys consolidated statement of income.   all derivatives, primarily interest rate exchange agreements and foreign currency exchange agreements, were classified in the companys consolidated
balance sheet at december 31, 2003 and 2002 respectively, as follows: miscellaneous other assets$102.4 million and $133.9 million; other long-term liabilities (excluding accrued interest)$135.5 million and $39.2 million; and accrued
payroll and other liabilities$29.2 million and $23.8 million.   there was no significant impact to the companys earnings related to the ineffective portion of any hedging instruments for the three years ended december 31, 2003.   fair value hedges   the company enters into fair value hedges to reduce the exposure to changes in the fair values of certain assets or liabilities. the types
of fair value hedges the company enters into include: (1) interest rate exchange agreements to convert a portion of its fixed-rate debt to floating-rate debt and (2)foreign currency exchange agreements for the exchange of various currencies
and interest rates. the foreign currency exchange agreements are entered into to hedge the currency risk associated with debt and inter-company loans denominated in foreign currencies, and essentially result in floating-rate assets or liabilities
denominated in u.s. dollars or appropriate functional currencies.   for fair value hedges, the gains or losses on derivatives as well as the offsetting gains or losses on the related hedged items are recognized in current earnings.   cash flow hedges   the company enters into cash flow hedges to reduce the exposure to variability in certain expected future cash flows. the types of cash flow
hedges the company enters into include: (1) interest rate exchange agreements that effectively convert a portion of floating-rate debt to fixed-rate debt and are designed to reduce the impact of interest rate changes on future interest expense, (2)
forward foreign exchange contracts and foreign currency options that are designed to protect against the reduction in value of forecasted foreign currency cash flows such as royalties and other payments denominated in foreign currencies, and (3)
foreign currency exchange agreements for the exchange of various currencies and interest rates. the foreign currency exchange agreements hedge the currency risk associated with debt and intercompany loans denominated in foreign currencies, and
essentially result in fixed-rate assets or liabilities denominated in u.s. dollars or appropriate functional currencies.   for cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the gains or losses on derivatives is reported in the deferred hedging adjustment component of accumulated
other comprehensive income in shareholders equity and reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods in which the hedged transaction affects earnings. the remaining gain or loss in excess of the cumulative change in the present value
of future cash flows of the hedged item, if any, is recognized in earnings during the period of change.   the company recorded net increases to the deferred hedging adjustment component of accumulated other comprehensive income in shareholders equity of
$8.0 million, $0.8 million and $7.7 million, after tax, related to cash flow hedges during the years ended december 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. based on interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates at december 31, 2003, no
significant amount of deferred hedging adjustments, after tax, included in accumulated other comprehensive income in shareholders equity at december 31, 2003 will be recognized in earnings in 2004 as the underlying hedged transactions are
realized. the maximum maturity date of any cash flow hedge of forecasted transactions at december 31, 2003 was 24 months, excluding instruments hedging forecasted payments of variable interest on existing financial instruments that have various
maturity dates through 2015.
mcdonalds corporation31
hedges of net investments in foreign operations   the company uses forward foreign exchange contracts and foreign currency denominated debt to hedge its investments in certain foreign
subsidiaries and affiliates. realized and unrealized translation adjustments from these hedges are included in shareholders equity in the foreign currency translation component of accumulated other comprehensive income and offset translation
adjustments on the underlying net assets of foreign subsidiaries and affiliates, which also are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income.   during the year ended december 31, 2003, the company recorded a decrease in translation adjustments in accumulated other comprehensive income of $378.1
million after tax (included in the net increase of $957.8 million of translation adjustments in the consolidated statement of shareholders equity), related primarily to foreign currency denominated debt designated as hedges of net investments.
during the year ended december 31, 2002, the company recorded a decrease in translation adjustments in accumulated other comprehensive income of $312.0 million after tax related to hedges of net investments, while during the year ended december 31,
2001, the company recorded an increase in translation adjustments of $168.5 million after tax related to hedges of net investments.   asset retirement obligations   in 2001, the fasb issued sfas no. 143, accounting for asset retirement obligations, effective january 1, 2003. the statement requires legal obligations associated
with the retirement of long-lived assets to be recognized at their fair value at the time that the obligations are incurred. upon initial recognition of a liability, the cost is capitalized as part of the related long-lived asset and allocated to
expense over the useful life of the asset. in first quarter 2003, the company recorded a noncash charge of $36.8 million after tax ($0.03 per diluted share) related to lease obligations in certain international markets to reflect the cumulative
effect of this accounting change. there is not a material effect to the companys ongoing results of operations or financial position.   common equity put options and forward contracts
during 2001, the company sold 12.2 million common equity put options in connection with its share repurchase program. premiums received of $31.8 million were recorded
in shareholders equity as a reduction of the cost of treasury stock purchased. in 2002, 10.1 million common equity put options were exercised and 2.1 million options expired unexercised, while 21.0 million options were exercised in 2001. the
total amount paid to acquire these shares as a result of the options being exercised was $286 million in 2002 and $700 million in 2001. no common equity put options were sold in either 2003 or 2002; therefore, at december 31, 2003 and 2002, there
were no common equity put options outstanding.   during 2001,
the company also entered into equity forward contracts in connection with its share repurchase program. the forward contracts for 5.5 million shares settled in march 2002. no additional equity forward contracts were entered into subsequent to march
2002.   sales of stock by subsidiaries and
affiliates   as permitted by staff accounting bulletin no. 51 issued by the
securities and exchange commission, when a subsidiary or affiliate sells unissued shares in a public offering, the company records an adjustment to reflect an increase or decrease in the carrying value of its investment and a resulting nonoperating
gain or loss.   per common share information
diluted net income per common share is calculated using net income divided by
diluted weighted-average shares. diluted weighted-average shares include weighted-average shares outstanding plus the dilutive effect of stock options, calculated using the treasury stock method. the dilutive effect of stock options was (in millions
of shares): 2003  6.7; 2002  8.4; 2001  19.6. stock options that were not included in diluted weighted-average shares because they would have been antidilutive were (in millions of shares): 2003  159.1; 2002  148.0;
2001  83.1. the dilutive effect of common equity put options and forward contracts in 2001 was not significant.   statement of cash flows   the company considers short-term, highly liquid investments to be cash equivalents. the impact of fluctuating foreign currencies on cash and equivalents was not material.

mcdonalds japan initial public offering (ipo) gain
in 2001, mcdonalds japan, the companys 50%-owned affiliate,
completed an ipo of 12 million shares. the company recorded a $137.1 million gain (pre and after tax) in nonoperating income to reflect an increase in the carrying value of its investment as a result of the cash proceeds from the ipo received by
mcdonalds japan.   franchise arrangements   individual franchise arrangements
generally include a lease and a license and provide for payment of initial fees, as well as continuing rent and service fees to the company based upon a percent of sales with minimum rent payments. mcdonalds franchisees are granted the right
to operate a restaurant using the mcdonalds system and, in most cases, the use of a restaurant facility, generally for a period of 20 years. franchisees pay related occupancy costs including property taxes, insurance and maintenance. in
addition, franchisees outside the u.s. generally pay a refundable, noninterest-bearing security deposit. foreign affiliates and developmental licensees pay a royalty to the company based upon a percent of sales.   the results of operations of restaurant businesses purchased and sold in
transactions with franchisees, affiliates and others were not material to the consolidated financial statements for periods prior to purchase and sale.   revenues from franchised and affiliated restaurants consisted of:

at december 31, 2003,
net property and equipment under franchise arrangements totaled $10.4 billion (including land of $3.0 billion) after deducting accumulated depreciation and amortization of $4.5 billion.   leasing arrangements   at december 31, 2003, the company was lessee at 6,781 restaurant locations through ground leases (the company leases the land and the
company or franchisee owns the building) and at 8,070 restaurant locations through improved leases (the company leases land and buildings). lease terms for most restaurants are generally for 20 to 25 years and, in many cases, provide for rent
escalations and renewal options, with certain leases providing purchase options. for most locations, the company is obligated for the related occupancy costs including property taxes, insurance and maintenance. however, for franchised sites, the
company requires the franchisees to pay these costs. in addition, the company is lessee under noncancelable leases covering certain offices and vehicles.   future minimum payments required under existing operating leases with initial terms of one year or more are:

subsidiaries and affiliates. these basis differences were approximately $4.2 billion at december 31, 2003 and consisted primarily of undistributed earnings considered permanently invested in the businesses. determination of the deferred income tax
liability on these unremitted earnings is not practicable because such liability, if any, is dependent on circumstances existing if and when remittance occurs.   segment and geographic information   the company operates in the food service industry. revenues consist of sales by
company-operated restaurants and fees from restaurants operated by franchisees and affiliates. fees from franchised and affiliated restaurants include continuing rent and service fees, initial fees, and royalties received from foreign affiliates and
developmental licensees. all intercompany revenues and expenses are eliminated in computing revenues and operating income. operating income includes the companys share of operating results of affiliates after interest expense and income taxes,
except for u.s. affiliates, which are reported before income taxes. royalties and other payments received from subsidiaries outside the u.s. were (in millions): 2003$684.5; 2002$644.1; 2001$607.7.   corporate general & administrative expenses are included in the corporate

millions)consolidated: 2003$23,405.9; 2002$21,976.6; 2001$20,355.3. u.s. based: 2003$9,069.0; 2002$9,254.3; 2001$8,670.4.   debt financing   line of credit agreements   at december 31, 2003, the company had several line of credit agreements with various banks totaling $1.3 billion, all of which remained
unused. subsequent to year end, the company renegotiated the line of credit agreements as follows: $750.0 million of lines expiring in 2005 with a term of 364 days and fees based on current credit ratings of .06% per annum on the total commitment,
with a feature that allows the company to convert the borrowings to a one-year loan at expiration; and a $500.0 million line expiring in 2009 with fees based on current credit ratings of .08% per annum on the total commitment. fees and interest
rates on these lines are based on the companys long-term credit rating assigned by moodys and standard and poors. the new agreements no longer require the company to maintain a minimum net worth. in addition, certain subsidiaries
outside the u.s. had unused lines of credit totaling $789.3 million at december 31, 2003; these were principally short term and denominated in various currencies at local market rates of interest.   the weighted-average interest rate of short-term borrowings was 4.3% at
december 31, 2003 (based on $341.1 million of foreign currency bank line borrowings) and 3.4% at december 31, 2002 (based on $257.9 million of commercial paper and $614.5 million of foreign currency bank line borrowings).   fair values   at december 31, 2003, the fair value of the companys debt obligations was estimated at
$10.2 billion, compared to a carrying amount of $9.7 billion. this fair value was estimated using various pricing models or discounted cash flow analyses that incorporated quoted market prices. the company has no current plans to retire a
significant amount of its debt prior to maturity.   the carrying
amounts for both cash and equivalents and notes receivable approximate fair value. foreign currency and interest rate exchange agreements, foreign currency options and forward foreign exchange contracts were recorded in the consolidated balance
sheet at fair value estimated using various pricing models or discounted cash flow analyses that incorporated quoted market prices. no fair value was estimated for noninterest-bearing security deposits by franchisees, because these deposits are an
integral part of the overall franchise arrangements.

debt obligations   the company has incurred debt obligations principally through public and private offerings and bank loans. there are no provisions in the
companys debt obligations that would accelerate repayment of debt as a result of a change in credit ratings or a material adverse change in the companys business. certain of the companys debt obligations contain cross-acceleration
provisions, and restrictions on company and subsidiary mortgages and the long-term debt of certain subsidiaries. under certain agreements, the company has the option to retire debt prior to maturity, either at par or at a premium over par.
the following table summarizes the companys debt
obligations. (interest rates reflected in the table include the effects of interest rate and foreign currency exchange agreements.)

aggregate maturities for 2003 debt obligations before fair value adjustments were as follows (in millions): 2004$388.0; 2005$1,371.6; 2006$1,941.0;
2007$666.7; 2008$851.0; thereafter$4,191.0. these amounts include reclassifications of short-term obligations to long-term obligations of $750.0 in 2006 and $500.0 thereafter as they are supported by long-term line of credit
agreements.
(7)
sfas no.133 requires that the underlying items in fair value hedges, in this case debt obligations, be recorded at fair value. the related hedging instrument is also recorded at
fair value in either miscellaneous other assets or other long-term liabilities. a portion ($131.1 million) of the adjustments at december 31, 2003 related to interest rate exchange agreements that were terminated in december 2002 and will amortize
as a reduction of interest expense over the remaining life of the debt.
(8)
includes current maturities of long-term debt and long-term debt included in the consolidated balance sheet. the decrease in debt obligations from december 31, 2002 to december
31, 2003 was due to net repayments ($891.6 million) and sfas no.133 noncash fair value adjustments ($43.6 million), partly offset by the impact of changes in exchange rates on foreign currency denominated debt ($686.3 million).
esop loans and other
guarantees   at december 31, 2003, the company has guaranteed and included in
total debt $15.4 million of notes issued by the leveraged employee stock ownership plan (esop) with payments through 2006. borrowings related to the esop at december 31, 2003, which include $85.9 million of loans from the company to the esop and the
$15.4 million of notes guaranteed by the company, are reflected as long-term debt with a corresponding reduction of shareholders equity (unearned esop compensation). the esop is repaying the loans and interest through 2018 using company
contributions and dividends from its mcdonalds common stock holdings. as the principal amount of the borrowings is repaid, the debt and the unearned esop compensation are being reduced.   the company also has guaranteed certain affiliate and other loans totaling
$88.8 million at december 31, 2003. these guarantees are contingent commitments generally issued by the company to support borrowing arrangements of certain u.s. partnerships and franchisees, and certain affiliates. the terms of the guarantees vary
and are equal to the remaining term of the related debt. at december 31, 2003, there was no carrying value for obligations under these guarantees in the companys consolidated balance sheet.   employee benefit plans
the companys profit sharing and savings plan for u.s.-based employees includes
profit sharing, 401(k) and leveraged employee stock ownership (esop) features. the 401(k) feature allows participants to make pretax contributions that are partly matched from shares released under the esop. mcdonalds executives, staff and
restaurant managers
mcdonalds corporation37
participate in any additional esop allocations and profit sharing contributions, based on their compensation. the profit
sharing contribution is discretionary, and the company determines the amount each year.   effective march 31, 2003, all contributions and related earnings can be invested among several investment alternatives, including mcdonalds common stock, in accordance with each participants elections.
prior to march 31, 2003, esop allocations and earnings were generally invested in mcdonalds common stock and all other contributions and related earnings could be invested among several investment alternatives, including mcdonalds common
stock.   in addition, the company maintains a nonqualified,
unfunded supplemental plan that allows participants to make tax-deferred contributions and receive company-provided allocations that cannot be made under the profit sharing and savings plan because of internal revenue service limitations. the
investment alternatives in the supplemental plan are based on certain of the market-rate investment alternatives under the profit sharing and savings plan. total liabilities under the supplemental plan were $329.3 million at december 31, 2003 and
$297.3 million at december 31, 2002 and were included in other long-term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet.   the company has entered into derivative contracts to hedge market-driven changes in certain of the supplemental plan liabilities. at december 31, 2003,
derivatives with a fair value of $51.6 million indexed to the companys stock and $49.4 million indexed to certain market indices were included in miscellaneous other assets in the consolidated balance sheet. all changes in plan liabilities and
in the fair value of the derivatives are recorded in selling, general & administrative expenses. changes in fair value of the derivatives indexed to the companys stock are recorded in the income statement because the contracts provide the
counterparty with a choice to settle in cash or shares.   total
u.s. costs for the profit sharing and savings plan, including nonqualified benefits and related hedging activities, were (in millions): 2003$60.3; 2002$50.1; 2001$54.6.   certain subsidiaries outside the u.s. also offer profit sharing, stock purchase or other similar benefit plans. total plan
costs outside the u.s. were (in millions): 2003$43.9; 2002$36.8; 2001$39.7.   other postretirement benefits and postemployment benefits, excluding severance benefits related to the 2002 and 2001 restructuring charges, were immaterial.   property and equipment

nonemployee directors that authorize the granting of various equity-based incentives including stock options, restricted stock and restricted stock units. the number of shares of common stock reserved for issuance under the plans was 206.0 million
at december 31, 2003, including 11.8 million available for future grants.   stock options   options to purchase common
stock are granted at the fair market value of the stock on the date of grant. therefore, no compensation cost has been recognized in the consolidated statement of income for these stock options. substantially all of the options become exercisable in
four equal installments, beginning a year from the date of the grant, and generally expire 10 years from the grant date. approximately 44 million options granted between may 1, 1999 and december 31, 2000 expire 13 years from the date of grant.
in 2001, the board of directors approved a special grant of
11.9 million options at a price of $28.90 as an incentive to meet an operating income performance goal for calendar year 2003. the options vested on january 31, 2004 and expire on june 30, 2004, rather than june 30, 2011, because the company did not
meet the performance goal.

managements report   management is
responsible for the preparation, integrity and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements and notes to the consolidated financial statements. the financial statements were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the u.s. and include certain amounts based on managements judgment and best estimates. other financial information presented is consistent with the financial statements.   the company maintains a system of internal control over financial reporting including safeguarding of assets against
unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition, which is designed to provide reasonable assurance to the companys management and board of directors regarding the preparation of reliable published financial statements and asset safeguarding. the
system includes a documented organizational structure and appropriate division of responsibilities; established policies and procedures that are communicated throughout the company; careful selection, training and development of our people; and
utilization of an internal audit program. policies and procedures prescribe that the company and all employees are to maintain high standards of proper business practices throughout the world.   there are inherent limitations to the effectiveness of any system of internal
control, including the possibility of human error and the circumvention or overriding of controls. accordingly, even an effective internal control system can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and
safeguarding of assets. furthermore, the effectiveness of an internal control system can change with circumstances. the company believes that it maintains an effective system of internal control over financial reporting and safeguarding of assets
against unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition.   the
consolidated financial statements have been audited by independent auditors, ernst & young llp, who were given unrestricted access to all financial records and related data. the audit report of ernst & young llp is presented herein.
the board of directors, operating through its audit committee
composed entirely of independent directors, oversees the financial reporting process. ernst & young llp has unrestricted access to the audit committee and regularly meets with the committee to discuss accounting, auditing and financial reporting
matters.   mcdonalds corporation

report of independent auditors   the board of directors and shareholders  mcdonalds corporation   we have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of mcdonalds corporation
as of december 31, 2003 and 2002, and the related consolidated statements of income, shareholders equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended december 31, 2003. these financial statements are the responsibility of
mcdonalds corporation management. our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.   we conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the u.s. those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. an audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. an audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. we believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.   in our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects, the consolidated financial position of mcdonalds corporation at december 31, 2003 and 2002, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended december 31,
2003, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the u.s.   as discussed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements, effective january 1, 2003, the company changed its method for accounting for asset retirement obligations to conform with sfas no. 143, accounting
for asset retirement obligations. effective january 1, 2002, the company changed its method for accounting for goodwill to conform with sfas no. 142, goodwill and other intangible assets.   ernst & young llp  chicago, illinois  january 26, 2004
