principal business activity is the design, development and worldwide marketing and selling of athletic footwear, apparel, equipment, accessories and services. nike is the largest seller of athletic footwear and apparel in the world. we sell our products to retail accounts, through nike-owned retail stores and internet websites (which we refer to collectively as our direct to consumer or dtc operations), and through a mix of independent distributors and licensees throughout the world. virtually all of our products are manufactured by independent contractors. nearly all footwear and apparel products are produced outside the united states, while equipment products are produced both in the united states and abroad.productswe focus our nike brand product offerings in nine key categories: running, nike basketball, the jordan brand, football (soccer), mens training, womens training, action sports, sportswear (our sports-inspired lifestyle products) and golf. men's training includes our baseball and american football product offerings. we also market products designed for kids, as well as for other athletic and recreational uses such as cricket, lacrosse, tennis, volleyball, wrestling, walking and outdoor activities.nikes athletic footwear products are designed primarily for specific athletic use, although a large percentage of the products are worn for casual or leisure purposes. we place considerable emphasis on innovation and high-quality construction in our products. sportswear, running, the jordan brand and football (soccer) are currently our top-selling footwear categories and we expect them to continue to lead in footwear sales.we also sell sports apparel covering the above-mentioned categories, which feature the same trademarks and are sold predominantly through the same marketing and distribution channels as athletic footwear. our sports apparel, similar to our athletic footwear products, is designed primarily for athletic use and exemplifies our commitment to innovation and high-quality construction. sportswear, men's training, running, football (soccer) and women's training are currently our top-selling apparel categories, and we expect them to continue to lead in apparel sales. we often market footwear, apparel and accessories in collections of similar use or by category. we also market apparel with licensed college and professional team and league logos.we sell a line of performance equipment and accessories under the nike brand name, including bags, socks, sport balls, eyewear, timepieces, digital devices, bats, gloves, protective equipment, golf clubs and other equipment designed for sports activities. we also sell small amounts of various plastic products to other manufacturers through our wholly-owned subsidiary, nike ihm, inc. our jordan brand designs, distributes and licenses athletic and casual footwear, apparel and accessories predominantly focused on basketball using the jumpman trademark. sales and operating results for the jordan brand are reported as a separate category and within the nike brand geographic operating segments, respectively.one of our wholly-owned subsidiary brands, hurley, headquartered in costa mesa, california, designs and distributes a line of action sports and youth lifestyle apparel and accessories under the hurley trademark. sales and operating results for hurley are included within the nike brand action sports category and within the nike brand's north america geographic operating segment, respectively.another of our wholly-owned subsidiary brands, converse, headquartered in boston, massachusetts, designs, distributes and licenses casual sneakers, apparel and accessories under the converse, chuck taylor, all star, one star, star chevron and jack purcell trademarks. operating results of the converse brand are reported on a stand-alone basis.in addition to the products we sell to our wholesale customers and directly to consumers through our dtc operations, we have also entered into license agreements that permit unaffiliated parties to manufacture and sell, using nike-owned trademarks, certain apparel, digital devices and applications and other equipment designed for sports activities.1table of contentssales and marketingfinancial information about geographic and segment operations appears in note17  operating segments and related information of the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements.we experience moderate fluctuations in aggregate sales volume during the year. historically, revenues in the first and fourth fiscal quarters have slightly exceeded those in the second and third quarters. however, the mix of product sales may vary considerably as a result of changes in seasonal and geographic demand for particular types of footwear, apparel and equipment, as well as other macroeconomic, operating and logistics-related factors.because nike is a consumer products company, the relative popularity of various sports and fitness activities and changing design trends affect the demand for our products. we must, therefore, respond to trends and shifts in consumer preferences by adjusting the mix of existing product offerings, developing new products, styles and categories and influencing sports and fitness preferences through extensive marketing. failure to respond in a timely and adequate manner could have a material adverse effect on our sales and profitability. this is a continuing risk. refer to item 1a. risk factors.we report our nike brand operations based on our internal geographic organization.each nike brand geography operates predominantly in one industry: the design, development, marketing and selling of athletic footwear, apparel, equipment, accessories and services.our reportable operating segments for the nike brand are: north america, western europe, central& eastern europe, greater china, japan and emerging markets. our nike brand direct to consumer operations are managed within each geographic operating segment.converse is also a reportable segment and operates in one industry: the design, marketing, licensing and selling of casual sneakers, apparel and accessories. converse direct to consumer operations, including e-commerce, are reported within the converse operating segment results.united states marketfor fiscal 2016, nike brand and converse sales in the united states accounted for approximately 47% of total revenues, compared to 46% for both fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2014. we sell our nike brand, jordan brand, hurley and converse products to thousands of retail accounts in the united states, including a mix of footwear stores, sporting goods stores, athletic specialty stores, department stores, skate, tennis and golf shops and other retail accounts. in the united states, we utilize nike sales offices to solicit sales as well as independent sales representatives to sell specialty products for golf and skateboarding. during fiscal 2016, our three largest customers accounted for approximately 25% of sales in the united states.we make substantial use of our futures ordering program, which allows retailers to order five to sixmonths in advance of delivery with the commitment that their orders will be delivered within a set time period at a fixed price. in fiscal 2016, 84% of our u.s. wholesale footwear shipments were made under the futures program, compared to 87% in fiscal 2015 and 86% in fiscal 2014. in fiscal 2016, 66% of our u.s. wholesale apparel shipments were made under the futures program, compared to 67% in fiscal 2015 and 71% in fiscal 2014.our direct to consumer operations sell nike brand, jordan brand, hurley and converse products to consumers through our e-commerce website, www.nike.com. in addition, our direct to consumer operations sell through the following number of retail stores in the united states:u.s. retail storesnumbernike brand factory stores196nike brand in-line stores, including employee-only stores34converse stores (including factory stores)103hurley stores (including factory and employee stores)29total362in the united states, nike has five significant distribution centers located in memphis, tennessee, two of which are owned and three are leased. nike brand apparel and equipment products are also shipped from our leased foothill ranch, california distribution center. converse and hurley products are shipped primarily from leased facilities in ontario, california. smaller leased distribution facilities are located in various parts of the united states.international marketsfor fiscal 2016, non-u.s. nike brand and converse sales accounted for 53% of total revenues, compared to 54% for both fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2014. we sell our products to retail accounts, through our own direct to consumer operations and through a mix of independent distributors, licensees and sales representatives around the world. we sell to thousands of retail accounts and ship products from 42 distribution centers outside of the united states. in many countries and regions, including canada, asia, some latin american countries and europe, we have a futures ordering program for retailers similar to the united states futures ordering program described above. during fiscal 2016, nikes three largest customers outside of the united states accounted for approximately 13% of total non-u.s.sales.in addition to nike and converse owned e-commerce websites in over 40 countries, our direct to consumer business operates the following number of retail stores outside the united states:non-u.s. retail storesnumbernike brand factory stores588nike brand in-line stores, including employee-only stores72converse stores (including factory stores)23total6832table of contentsinternational branch offices and subsidiaries of nike are located in argentina, australia, austria, belgium, bermuda, brazil, canada, chile, china, croatia, the czech republic, denmark, finland, france, germany, greece, hong kong, hungary, india, indonesia, ireland, israel, italy, japan, jordan, korea, malaysia, mexico, newzealand, the netherlands, norway, panama, the philippines, poland, portugal, russia, singapore, slovakia, slovenia, south africa, spain, sri lanka, sweden, switzerland, taiwan, thailand, turkey, the united arab emirates, the united kingdom, uruguay and vietnam.significant customerno customer accounted for 10% or more of our worldwide net revenues during fiscal 2016.ordersworldwide futures orders for nike brand athletic footwear and apparel, scheduled for delivery from june through november 2016, were $14.9 billion compared with $13.8 billion for the same period last year. nike brand reported futures include (1) orders from external wholesale customers and (2) internal orders from our dtc in-line stores and e-commerce operations which are reflected at prices that are comparable to prices charged to external wholesale customers. the u.s. dollar futures orders amount is calculated based upon our internal forecast of the actual currency exchange rates under which our revenues will be translated during this period. reported futures orders are not necessarily indicative of our expectation of revenues for this period. this is because the mix of orders can shift between futures and at-once orders and the fulfillment of certain of these futures orders may fall outside of the scheduled time period noted above. in addition, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations as well as differing levels of order cancellations, discounts and returns can cause differences in the comparisons between futures orders and actual revenues. moreover, a portion of our revenue is not derived from futures orders, including sales of at-once and closeout nike brand footwear and apparel, all sales of nike brand equipment, the difference between retail sales and internal orders from our direct to consumer in-line stores and e-commerce operations, and sales from our converse, hurley and nike golf businesses.product research, design and developmentwe believe our research, design and development efforts are key factors in our success. technical innovation in the design and manufacturing process of footwear, apparel and athletic equipment receive continued emphasis as we strive to produce products that help to enhance athletic performance, reduce injury and maximize comfort while reducing waste.in addition to our own staff of specialists in the areas of biomechanics, chemistry, exercise physiology, engineering, industrial design, sustainability and related fields, we also utilize research committees and advisory boards made up of athletes, coaches, trainers, equipment managers, orthopedists, podiatrists and other experts who consult with us and review designs, materials, concepts for product and manufacturing process improvements and compliance with product safety regulations around the world. employee athletes, athletes engaged under sports marketing contracts and other athletes wear-test and evaluate products during the design and development process.as we continue to develop new technologies, we are simultaneously focused on the design of innovative products incorporating such technologies throughout our product categories. using market intelligence and research, our various design teams identify opportunities to leverage new technologies in existing categories responding to consumer preferences. the proliferation of nike air, lunar, zoom, free, flywire, dri-fit, flyknit, flyweave and nike+ technologies through running, nike basketball, the jordan brand, football (soccer), men's training, women's training and sportswear, among others, typifies our dedication to designing innovative products.manufacturingwe are supplied by approximately 142 footwear factories located in 15 countries. the largest single footwear factory accounted for approximately 7% of total fiscal 2016 nike brand footwear production. virtually all of our footwear is manufactured outside of the united states by independent contract manufacturers who often operate multiple factories. in fiscal 2016, contract factories in vietnam, china and indonesia manufactured approximately 44%, 29% and 21% of total nike brand footwear, respectively. we also have manufacturing agreements with independent factories in argentina, india, brazil and mexico to manufacture footwear for sale primarily within those countries.in fiscal 2016, five footwear contract manufacturers each accounted for greater than 10% of footwear production and in aggregate accounted for approximately 69% of nike brand footwear production.we are supplied by approximately 394 apparel factories located in 39 countries. the largest single apparel factory accounted for approximately 12% of total fiscal 2016 nike brand apparel production. virtually all of our apparel is manufactured outside of the united states by independent contract manufacturers which often operate multiple factories. in fiscal 2016, contract factories in china, vietnam and indonesia produced approximately 26%, 23% and 9% of total nike brand apparel, respectively. in fiscal 2016, one apparel contract manufacturer accounted for more than 10% of apparel production, and the top five contract manufacturers in aggregate accounted for approximately 39% of nike brand apparel production.the principal materials used in our footwear products are natural and synthetic rubber, plastic compounds, foam cushioning materials, natural and synthetic leather, nylon, polyester and canvas, as well as polyurethane films used to make nike air-sole cushioning components. during fiscal 2016, nike ihm, inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of nike, inc., with facilities near beaverton, oregon and in st. charles, missouri, as well as independent contractors in china and vietnam, were our largest suppliers of the air-sole cushioning components used in footwear. the principal materials used in our apparel products are natural and synthetic fabrics and threads (both virgin and recycled); specialized performance fabrics designed to efficiently wick moisture away from the body, retain heat and repel rain and/or snow; and plastic and metal hardware. nikes independent contractors and suppliers buy raw materials for the manufacturing of our footwear, apparel and equipment products. most raw materials are available and purchased by those independent contractors and suppliers in the countries where manufacturing takes place. nike's independent contract manufacturers and suppliers have thus far experienced little difficulty in satisfying raw material requirements for the production of our products.3table of contentssince 1972, sojitz corporation of america (sojitz america), a large japanese trading company and the sole owner of our redeemable preferred stock, has performed significant import-export financing services for us. during fiscal 2016, sojitz america provided financing and purchasing services for nike brand products sold in certain nike markets including argentina, uruguay, brazil, canada, india, south africa and thailand, excluding products produced and sold in the same country. approximately 6% of nike brand sales occurred in those countries. any failure of sojitz america to provide these services or any failure of sojitz americas banks could disrupt our ability to acquire products from our suppliers and to deliver products to our customers in those markets. such a disruption could result in canceled orders that would adversely affect sales and profitability. however, we believe that any such disruption would be short-term in duration due to the ready availability of alternative sources of financing at competitive rates. our current agreements with sojitz america expire on may31, 2018 and contain a provision allowing us to extend the agreements to may 31, 2019.international operations and tradeour international operations and sources of supply are subject to the usual risks of doing business abroad, such as possible increases in import duties, anti-dumping measures, quotas, safeguard measures, trade restrictions, restrictions on the transfer of funds and, in certain parts of the world, political instability and terrorism. we have not, to date, been materially affected by any such risk, but cannot predict the likelihood of such material effects occurring in the future.in recent years, uncertain global and regional economic conditions have affected international trade and caused a rise in protectionist actions around the world.these trends are affecting many global manufacturing and service sectors, and the footwear and apparel industries, as a whole, are not immune. companies in our industry are facing trade protectionism in many different regions, and in nearly all cases we are working together with industry groups to address trade issues and reduce the impact to the industry, while observing applicable competition laws. notwithstanding our efforts, protectionist measures have resulted in increases in the cost of our products, and additional measures, if implemented, could adversely affect sales and/or profitability for nike as well as the imported footwear and apparel industry as a whole.we monitor protectionist trends and developments throughout the world that may materially impact our industry, and we engage in administrative and judicial processes to mitigate trade restrictions. we are actively monitoring actions that may result in additional anti-dumping measures and could affect our industry. we are also monitoring for and advocating against other impediments that may limit or delay customs clearance for imports of footwear, apparel and equipment. moreover, with respect to trade restrictions targeting china, which represents an important sourcing country and consumer market for us, we are working with a broad coalition of global businesses and trade associations representing a wide variety of sectors to help ensure that any legislation enacted and implemented (i)addresses legitimate and core concerns, (ii)is consistent with international trade rules, and (iii)reflects and considers china's domestic economy and the important role it has in the global economic community.where trade protection measures are implemented, we believe that we have the ability to develop, over a period of time, adequate alternative sources of supply for the products obtained from our present suppliers. if events prevented us from acquiring products from our suppliers in a particular country, our operations could be temporarily disrupted and we could experience an adverse financial impact. however, we believe we could abate any such disruption, and that much of the adverse impact on supply would, therefore, be of a short-term nature, although alternate sources of supply might not be as cost-effective and could have an ongoing adverse impact on profitability.nike advocates for trade liberalization for footwear and apparel in a number of regional and bilateral free trade agreements. the trans-pacific partnership (tpp), if ultimately ratified, has the potential to reduce or eliminate high rates of customs duties for imports into the united states of nike products sourced from tpp countries (primarily footwear and apparel from vietnam and apparel from malaysia). similarly, the european union has concluded a free trade agreement with vietnam that, if approved, could lead to duty reduction or elimination for footwear and apparel.competitionthe athletic footwear, apparel and equipment industry is highly competitive on a worldwide basis. we compete internationally with a significant number of athletic and leisure footwear companies, athletic and leisure apparel companies, sports equipment companies and large companies having diversified lines of athletic and leisure footwear, apparel and equipment, including adidas, asics, li ning, lululemon athletica, puma, v.f. corporation and under armour, among others. the intense competition and the rapid changes in technology and consumer preferences in the markets for athletic and leisure footwear and apparel and athletic equipment, constitute significant risk factors in our operations.nike is the largest seller of athletic footwear, apparel and equipment in the world. important aspects of competition in this industry are:product attributes such as quality; performance and reliability; new product innovation and development and consumer price/value.consumer connection and affinity for brands and products, developed through marketing and promotion; social media interaction; customer support and service; identification with prominent and influential athletes, coaches, teams, colleges and sports leagues who endorse our brands and use our products and active engagement through sponsored sporting events and clinics. effective sourcing and distribution of products, with attractive merchandising and presentation at retail, both in-store and online.we believe that we are competitive in all of these areas.trademarks and patentswe utilize trademarks on nearly all of our products and believe having distinctive marks that are readily identifiable is an important factor in creating a market for our goods, in identifying our brands and the company and in distinguishing our goods from the goods of others. we consider our nike and swoosh design trademarks to be among our most valuable assets and we have registered these trademarks in almost 170 jurisdictions worldwide. in addition, we own many other trademarks that we utilize in marketing our products. we own common law rights in the trade dress of several significant shoe designs and elements. for certain trade dress, we have sought and obtained trademark registrations.we have copyright protection in our design, graphics and other original works. when appropriate, we have sought registrations for this content.we own patents and have a patent license, facilitating our use of air technologies. 4table of contentswe also file and maintain many u.s. and foreign utility patents, as well as many u.s. and foreign design patents protecting components, manufacturing techniques, features and industrial design used in various athletic and leisure footwear and apparel, athletic equipment, digital devices and golf products. these patents expire at various times; patents issued for original applications filed this calendar year in the united states may last until 2031 for design patents and until 2036 for utility patents.we believe our success depends upon our capabilities in areas such as design, research and development, production and marketing rather than exclusively upon our patent and trade secret positions. however, we have followed a policy of filing patent applications for the unitedstates and select foreign countries on inventions, designs and improvements that we deem valuable. we also continue to vigorously protect our trademarks and patents against third-party infringement.employeesas of may31, 2016, we had approximately 70,700 employees worldwide, including retail and part-time employees. management considers its relationship with employees to be excellent. none of our employees are represented by a union, except for certain employees in the emerging markets geography, where local law requires those employees to be represented by a trade union. also, in some countries outside of the united states, local laws require employee representation by works councils (which may be entitled to information and consultation on certain company decisions) or by organizations similar to a union. in certain european countries, we are required by local law to enter into and/or comply with industry-wide or national collective bargaining agreements. nike has never experienced a material interruption of operations due to labor disagreements.executive officers of the registrantthe executive officers of nike, inc. as of july15, 2016 are as follows:mark g. parker, chairman, president and chief

contentsitem1a. risk factorsspecial note regarding forward-looking statements and analyst reportscertain written and oral statements, other than purely historic information, including estimates, projections, statements relating to nikes business plans, objectives and expected operating results and the assumptions upon which those statements are based, made or incorporated by reference from time to time by nike or its representatives in this report, other reports, filings with the sec, press releases, conferences or otherwise, are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 and section21e of the securities exchange act of 1934, as amended. forward-looking statements include, without limitation, any statement that may predict, forecast, indicate or imply future results, performance or achievements, and may contain the words believe, anticipate, expect, estimate, project, will be, will continue, will likely result or words or phrases of similar meaning. forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties which may cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. the risks and uncertainties are detailed from time to time in reports filed by nike with the sec, including reports filed on forms 8-k, 10-q and 10-k, and include, among others, the following: international, national and local general economic and market conditions; the size and growth of the overall athletic footwear, apparel and equipment markets; intense competition among designers, marketers, distributors and sellers of athletic footwear, apparel and equipment for consumers and endorsers; demographic changes; changes in consumer preferences; popularity of particular designs, categories of products and sports; seasonal and geographic demand for nike products; difficulties in anticipating or forecasting changes in consumer preferences, consumer demand for nike products and the various market factors described above; difficulties in implementing, operating and maintaining nikes increasingly complex information systems and controls, including, without limitation, the systems related to demand and supply planning and inventory control; interruptions in data and information technology systems; consumer data security; fluctuations and difficulty in forecasting operating results, including, without limitation, the fact that advance futures orders may not be indicative of future revenues due to changes in shipment timing, the changing mix of futures and at-once orders, and discounts, order cancellations and returns; the ability of nike to sustain, manage or forecast its growth and inventories; the size, timing and mix of purchases of nikes products; increases in the cost of materials, labor and energy used to manufacture products; new product development and introduction; the ability to secure and protect trademarks, patents and other intellectual property; product performance and quality; customer service; adverse publicity; the loss of significant customers or suppliers; dependence on distributors and licensees; business disruptions; increased costs of freight and transportation to meet delivery deadlines; increases in borrowing costs due to any decline in nike's debt ratings; changes in business strategy or development plans; general risks associated with doing business outside the united states, including, without limitation, exchange rate fluctuations, import duties, tariffs, quotas, political and economic instability and terrorism; changes in government regulations; the impact of, including business and legal developments relating to, climate change, natural disasters, liability and other claims asserted against nike; the ability to attract and retain qualified personnel; the effects of nike's decision to invest in or divest of businesses and other factors referenced or incorporated by reference in this report and other reports.the risks included here are not exhaustive. other sections of this report may include additional factors which could adversely affect nikes business and financial performance. moreover, nike operates in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment. new risks emerge from time to time and it is not possible for management to predict all such risks, nor can it assess the impact of all such risks on nikes business or the extent to which any risk, or combination of risks, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. given these risks and uncertainties, investors should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements as a prediction of actual results.investors should also be aware that while nike does, from time to time, communicate with securities analysts, it is against nikes policy to disclose to them any material non-public information or other confidential commercial information. accordingly, shareholders should not assume that nike agrees with any statement or report issued by any analyst irrespective of the content of the statement or report. furthermore, nike has a policy against issuing or confirming financial forecasts or projections issued by others. thus, to the extent that reports issued by securities analysts contain any projections, forecasts or opinions, such reports are not the responsibility of nike.our products face intense competition.nike is a consumer products company and the relative popularity of various sports and fitness activities and changing design trends affect the demand for our products. the athletic footwear, apparel and equipment industry is highly competitive both in the united states and worldwide. we compete internationally with a significant number of athletic and leisure footwear companies, athletic and leisure apparel companies, sports equipment companies and large companies having diversified lines of athletic and leisure footwear, apparel and equipment. we also compete with other companies for the production capacity of independent manufacturers that produce our products.product offerings, technologies, marketing expenditures (including expenditures for advertising and endorsements), pricing, costs of production, customer service and social media presence are areas of intense competition. this, in addition to rapid changes in technology and consumer preferences in the markets for athletic and leisure footwear and apparel and athletic equipment, constitute significant risk factors in our operations. if we do not adequately and timely anticipate and respond to our competitors, our costs may increase or the consumer demand for our products may decline significantly.failure to maintain our reputation and brand image could negatively impact our business.our iconic brands have worldwide recognition, and our success depends on our ability to maintain and enhance our brand image and reputation. maintaining, promoting and growing our brands will depend on our design and marketing efforts, including advertising and consumer campaigns, product innovation and product quality. our commitment to product innovation and quality and our continuing investment in design (including materials) and marketing may not have the desired impact on our brand image and reputation. we could be adversely impacted if we fail to achieve any of these objectives or if the reputation or image of any of our brands is tarnished or receives negative publicity. in addition, adverse publicity about regulatory or legal action against us, or by us, could damage our reputation and brand image, undermine consumer confidence in us and reduce long-term demand for our products, even if the regulatory or legal action is unfounded or not material to our operations.in addition, our success in maintaining, extending and expanding our brand image depends on our ability to adapt to a rapidly changing media environment, including our increasing reliance on social media and digital dissemination of advertising campaigns. negative posts or comments about us on social networking websites could seriously damage our reputation and brand image. if we do not maintain, extend and expand our brand image, then our product sales, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.7table of contentsif we are unable to anticipate consumer preferences and develop new products, we may not be able to maintain or increase our revenues and profits.our success depends on our ability to identify, originate and define product trends as well as to anticipate, gauge and react to changing consumer demands in a timely manner. however, lead times for many of our products may make it more difficult for us to respond rapidly to new or changing product trends or consumer preferences. all of our products are subject to changing consumer preferences that cannot be predicted with certainty. our new products may not receive consumer acceptance as consumer preferences could shift rapidly to different types of performance products or away from these types of products altogether, and our future success depends in part on our ability to anticipate and respond to these changes. if we fail to anticipate accurately and respond to trends and shifts in consumer preferences by adjusting the mix of existing product offerings, developing new products, designs, styles and categories, and influencing sports and fitness preferences through aggressive marketing, we could experience lower sales, excess inventories or lower profit margins, any of which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. in addition, we market our products globally through a diverse spectrum of advertising and promotional programs and campaigns, including social media and online advertising. if we do not successfully market our products or if advertising and promotional costs increase, these factors could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.we rely on technical innovation and high-quality products to compete in the market for our products.technical innovation and quality control in the design and manufacturing process of footwear, apparel and athletic equipment is essential to the commercial success of our products. research and development plays a key role in technical innovation. we rely upon specialists in the fields of biomechanics, chemistry, exercise physiology, engineering, industrial design, sustainability and related fields, as well as research committees and advisory boards made up of athletes, coaches, trainers, equipment managers, orthopedists, podiatrists and other experts to develop and test cutting edge performance products. while we strive to produce products that help to enhance athletic performance, reduce injury and maximize comfort, if we fail to introduce technical innovation in our products, consumer demand for our products could decline, and if we experience problems with the quality of our products, we may incur substantial expense to remedy the problems.failure to continue to obtain or maintain high-quality endorsers of our products could harm our business.we establish relationships with professional athletes, sports teams and leagues to develop, evaluate and promote our products, as well as establish product authenticity with consumers. however, as competition in our industry has increased, the costs associated with establishing and retaining such sponsorships and other relationships have increased. if we are unable to maintain our current associations with professional athletes, sports teams and leagues, or to do so at a reasonable cost, we could lose the on-field authenticity associated with our products, and we may be required to modify and substantially increase our marketing investments. as a result, our brands, net revenues, expenses and profitability could be harmed.furthermore, if certain endorsers were to stop using our products contrary to their endorsement agreements, our business could be adversely affected. in addition, actions taken by athletes, teams or leagues associated with our products that harm the reputations of those athletes, teams or leagues, could also seriously harm our brand image with consumers and, as a result, could have an adverse effect on our sales and financial condition. in addition, poor performance by our endorsers, a failure to continue to correctly identify promising athletes to use and endorse our products or a failure to enter into cost-effective endorsement arrangements with prominent athletes and sports organizations could adversely affect our brand, sales and profitability.currency exchange rate fluctuations could result in lower revenues, higher costs and decreased margins and earnings.a majority of our products are manufactured and sold outside of the united states. as a result, we conduct purchase and sale transactions in various currencies, which increases our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates globally. additionally, there has been, and may continue to be, volatility in currency exchange rates as a result of the united kingdom's june 23, 2016 referendum in which voters approved the united kingdom's exit from the european union, commonly referred to as brexit. our international revenues and expenses generally are derived from sales and operations in foreign currencies, and these revenues and expenses could be affected by currency fluctuations, specifically amounts recorded in foreign currencies and translated into u.s. dollars for consolidated financial reporting, as weakening of foreign currencies relative to the u.s. dollar adversely affects the u.s. dollar value of the company's foreign currency-denominated sales and earnings. currency exchange rate fluctuations could also disrupt the business of the independent manufacturers that produce our products by making their purchases of raw materials more expensive and more difficult to finance. foreign currency fluctuations have adversely affected and could continue to have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.we may hedge certain foreign currency exposures to lessen and delay, but not to completely eliminate, the effects of foreign currency fluctuations on our financial results. since the hedging activities are designed to lessen volatility, they not only reduce the negative impact of a stronger u.s.dollar or other trading currency, but they also reduce the positive impact of a weaker u.s. dollar or other trading currency. our future financial results could be significantly affected by the value of the u.s.dollar in relation to the foreign currencies in which we conduct business. the degree to which our financial results are affected for any given time period will depend in part upon our hedging activities.8table of contentsglobal economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.the uncertain state of the global economy continues to impact businesses around the world, most acutely in emerging markets and developing economies. if global economic and financial market conditions do not improve or deteriorate, the following factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition:slower consumer spending may result in reduced demand for our products, reduced orders from retailers for our products, order cancellations, lower revenues, higher discounts, increased inventories and lower gross margins.in the future, we may be unable to access financing in the credit and capital markets at reasonable rates in the event we find it desirable to do so.we conduct transactions in various currencies, which increases our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates relative to the u.s. dollar.continued volatility in the markets and exchange rates for foreign currencies and contracts in foreign currencies could have a significant impact on our reported operating results and financial condition.continued volatility in the availability and prices for commodities and raw materials we use in our products and in our supply chain (such as cotton or petroleum derivatives) could have a material adverse effect on our costs, gross margins and profitability.if retailers of our products experience declining revenues or experience difficulty obtaining financing in the capital and credit markets to purchase our products, this could result in reduced orders for our products, order cancellations, late retailer payments, extended payment terms, higher accounts receivable, reduced cash flows, greater expense associated with collection efforts and increased bad debt expense.if retailers of our products experience severe financial difficulty, some may become insolvent and cease business operations, which could negatively impact the sale of our products to consumers.if contract manufacturers of our products or other participants in our supply chain experience difficulty obtaining financing in the capital and credit markets to purchase raw materials or to finance capital equipment and other general working capital needs, it may result in delays or non-delivery of shipments of our products.our business is affected by seasonality, which could result in fluctuations in our operating results.we experience moderate fluctuations in aggregate sales volume during the year. historically, revenues in the first and fourth fiscal quarters have slightly exceeded those in the second and third fiscal quarters. however, the mix of product sales may vary considerably from time to time as a result of changes in seasonal and geographic demand for particular types of footwear, apparel and equipment and in connection with the timing of significant sporting events, including without limitation the olympics and the european football championship. in addition, our customers may cancel orders, change delivery schedules or change the mix of products ordered with minimal notice. as a result, we may not be able to accurately predict our quarterly sales. accordingly, our results of operations are likely to fluctuate significantly from period to period. this seasonality, along with other factors that are beyond our control, including general economic conditions, changes in consumer preferences, weather conditions, availability of import quotas, transportation disruptions and currency exchange rate fluctuations, could adversely affect our business and cause our results of operations to fluctuate. our operating margins are also sensitive to a number of additional factors that are beyond our control, including manufacturing and transportation costs, shifts in product sales mix and geographic sales trends, all of which we expect to continue. results of operations in any period should not be considered indicative of the results to be expected for any future period.futures orders may not be an accurate indication of our future revenues.we make substantial use of our futures ordering program, which allows retailers to order five to six months in advance of delivery with the commitment that their orders will be delivered within a set period of time at a fixed price. our futures ordering program allows us to minimize the amount of products we hold in inventory, purchasing costs, the time necessary to fill customer orders and the risk of non-delivery. we report changes in futures orders in our periodic financial reports. although we believe futures orders are an important indicator of our future revenues, reported futures orders are not necessarily indicative of our expectation of revenues for any future period. this is due to year-over-year changes in shipment timing, changes in the mix of orders between futures and at-once orders and because the fulfillment of certain orders may fall outside of the schedule noted above. in addition, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, as well as differing levels of order cancellations, discounts and returns can cause differences in the comparisons between futures orders and actual revenues. moreover, a portion of our revenue is not derived from futures orders, including sales of at-once and closeout nike brand footwear and apparel, all sales of nike brand equipment, the difference between retail sales and internal orders from our direct to consumer in-line stores and e-commerce operations, and sales from converse, nike golf and hurley.our futures ordering program does not prevent excess inventories or inventory shortages, which could result in decreased operating margins, reduced cash flows and harm to our business.we purchase products from manufacturers outside of our futures ordering program and in advance of customer orders, which we hold in inventory and resell to customers. there is a risk we may be unable to sell excess products ordered from manufacturers. inventory levels in excess of customer demand may result in inventory write-downs, and the sale of excess inventory at discounted prices could significantly impair our brand image and have an adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition and cash flows. conversely, if we underestimate consumer demand for our products or if our manufacturers fail to supply products we require at the time we need them, we may experience inventory shortages. inventory shortages might delay shipments to customers, negatively impact retailer and distributor relationships and diminish brand loyalty.the difficulty in forecasting demand also makes it difficult to estimate our future results of operations, financial condition and cash flows from period to period. a failure to accurately predict the level of demand for our products could adversely affect our net revenues and net income, and we are unlikely to forecast such effects with any certainty in advance.9table of contentswe may be adversely affected by the financial health of our customers.we extend credit to our customers based on an assessment of a customers financial condition, generally without requiring collateral. to assist in the scheduling of production and the shipping of seasonal products, we offer customers the ability to place orders five to six months ahead of delivery under our futures ordering program. these advance orders may be canceled, and the risk of cancellation may increase when dealing with financially unstable retailers or retailers struggling with economic uncertainty. in the past, some customers have experienced financial difficulties up to and including bankruptcies, which have had an adverse effect on our sales, our ability to collect on receivables and our financial condition. when the retail economy weakens, retailers may be more cautious with orders. a slowing economy in our key markets could adversely affect the financial health of our customers, which in turn could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. in addition, product sales are dependent in part on high quality merchandising and an appealing store environment to attract consumers, which requires continuing investments by retailers. retailers that experience financial difficulties may fail to make such investments or delay them, resulting in lower sales and orders for our products.consolidation of retailers or concentration of retail market share among a few retailers may increase and concentrate our credit risk and impair our ability to sell products.the athletic footwear, apparel and equipment retail markets in some countries are dominated by a few large athletic footwear, apparel and equipment retailers with many stores. these retailers have in the past increased their market share and may continue to do so in the future by expanding through acquisitions and construction of additional stores. these situations concentrate our credit risk with a relatively small number of retailers, and, if any of these retailers were to experience a shortage of liquidity, it would increase the risk that their outstanding payables to us may not be paid. in addition, increasing market share concentration among one or a few retailers in a particular country or region increases the risk that if any one of them substantially reduces their purchases of our products, we may be unable to find a sufficient number of other retail outlets for our products to sustain the same level of sales and revenues.our direct to consumer operations have required and will continue to require a substantial investment and commitment of resources and are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties.our direct to consumer stores have required substantial fixed investment in equipment and leasehold improvements, information systems, inventory and personnel. we have entered into substantial operating lease commitments for retail space. certain stores have been designed and built to serve as high-profile venues to promote brand awareness and marketing activities. because of their unique design elements, locations and size, these stores require substantially more investment than other stores. due to the high fixed-cost structure associated with our direct to consumer operations, a decline in sales or the closure or poor performance of individual or multiple stores could result in significant lease termination costs, write-offs of equipment and leasehold improvements and employee-related costs.many factors unique to retail operations, some of which are beyond the companys control, pose risks and uncertainties. risks include, but are not limited to: credit card fraud; mismanagement of existing retail channel partners; and inability to manage costs associated with store construction and operation. in addition, extreme weather conditions in the areas in which our stores are located could adversely affect our business. if the technology-based systems that give our customers the ability to shop with us online do not function effectively, our operating results, as well as our ability to grow our e-commerce business globally, could be materially adversely affected.many of our customers shop with us through our e-commerce website and mobile commerce applications. increasingly, customers are using tablets and smart phones to shop online with us and with our competitors and to do comparison shopping. we are increasingly using social media and proprietary mobile applications to interact with our customers and as a means to enhance their shopping experience. any failure on our part to provide attractive, effective, reliable, user-friendly e-commerce platforms that offer a wide assortment of merchandise with rapid delivery options and that continually meet the changing expectations of online shoppers could place us at a competitive disadvantage, result in the loss of e-commerce and other sales, harm our reputation with customers, have a material adverse impact on the growth of our e-commerce business globally and could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations.risks specific to our e-commerce business also include diversion of sales from our and our retailers' brick and mortar stores, difficulty in recreating the in-store experience through direct channels and liability for online content. our failure to successfully respond to these risks might adversely affect sales in our e-commerce business, as well as damage our reputation and brands.failure to adequately protect or enforce our intellectual property rights could adversely affect our business.we believe that our intellectual property rights are important to our brand, our success and our competitive position. we periodically discover products that are counterfeit reproductions of our products or that otherwise infringe on our intellectual property rights. if we are unsuccessful in enforcing our intellectual property, continued sales of these products could adversely affect our sales and our brand and could result in a shift of consumer preference away from our products.the actions we take to establish and protect our intellectual property rights may not be adequate to prevent imitation of our products by others or to prevent others from seeking to block sales of our products as violations of proprietary rights. we may be subject to liability if third parties successfully claim that we infringe on their intellectual property rights. defending infringement claims could be expensive and time-consuming and might result in our entering into costly license agreements. we also may be subject to significant damages or injunctions against development, use, importation and/or sale of certain products.we take various actions to prevent the unauthorized use and/or disclosure of confidential information. such actions include contractual measures such as entering into non-disclosure and non-compete agreements and providing confidential information awareness training. our controls and efforts to prevent unauthorized use and/or disclosure of confidential information might not always be effective. confidential information that is related to business strategy, new technologies, mergers and acquisitions, unpublished financial results or personal data could be prematurely or inadvertently used and/or disclosed, resulting in a loss of reputation, a decline in our stock price and/or a negative impact on our market position, and could lead to damages, fines, penalties or injunctions.10table of contentsin addition, the laws of certain countries may not protect or allow enforcement of intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states. we may face significant expenses and liability in connection with the protection of our intellectual property rights, including outside the united states, and if we are unable to successfully protect our rights or resolve intellectual property conflicts with others, our business or financial condition may be adversely affected.we are subject to the risk that our licensees may not generate expected sales or maintain the value of our brands. we currently license, and expect to continue licensing, certain of our proprietary rights, such as trademarks or copyrighted material, to third parties. if our licensees fail to successfully market and sell licensed products, or fail to obtain sufficient capital or effectively manage their business operations, customer relationships, labor relationships, supplier relationships or credit risks, it could adversely affect our revenues, both directly from reduced royalties received and indirectly from reduced sales of our other products. we also rely on our licensees to help preserve the value of our brands. although we attempt to protect our brands through approval rights over the design, production processes, quality, packaging, merchandising, distribution, advertising and promotion of our licensed products, we cannot completely control the use of our licensed brands by our licensees. the misuse of a brand by a licensee could have a material adverse effect on that brand and on us.we are subject to data security and privacy risks that could negatively affect our results, operations or reputation.in addition to our own sensitive and proprietary business information, we collect transactional and personal information about our customers and users of our digital experiences, which include online distribution channels and product engagement and personal fitness applications. hackers and data thieves are increasingly sophisticated and operate large-scale and complex automated attacks. any breach of our network may result in the loss of valuable business data, misappropriation of our consumers, users' or employees personal information or a disruption of our business, which could give rise to unwanted media attention, materially damage our consumers, customer relationships and our reputation and result in lost sales, lost users, fines, or lawsuits. we also may need to expend significant resources to protect against, respond to and/or redress problems caused by any breach.in addition, we must comply with increasingly complex and rigorous regulatory standards enacted to protect business and personal data. compliance with existing and proposed laws and regulations can be costly, and any failure to comply with these regulatory standards could subject us to legal and reputational risks. misuse of or failure to secure personal information could also result in violation of data privacy laws and regulations, proceedings against the company by governmental entities or others, damage to our reputation and credibility and could have a negative impact on revenues and profits.failure of our contractors or our licensees contractors to comply with our code of conduct, local laws and other standards could harm our business.we work with hundreds of contractors outside of the united states to manufacture our products, and we also have license agreements that permit unaffiliated parties to manufacture or contract for the manufacture of products using our intellectual property. we require the contractors that directly manufacture our products and our licensees that make products using our intellectual property (including, indirectly, their contract manufacturers) to comply with a code of conduct and other environmental, health and safety standards for the benefit of workers. we also require these contractors to comply with applicable standards for product safety. notwithstanding their contractual obligations, from time to time contractors may not comply with such standards or applicable local law or our licensees may fail to enforce such standards or applicable local law on their contractors. significant or continuing noncompliance with such standards and laws by one or more contractors could harm our reputation or result in a product recall and, as a result, could have an adverse effect on our sales and financial condition.our international operations involve inherent risks which could result in harm to our business.virtually all of our athletic footwear and apparel is manufactured outside of the united states, and the majority of our products are sold outside of the united states. accordingly, we are subject to the risks generally associated with global trade and doing business abroad, which include foreign laws and regulations, varying consumer preferences across geographic regions, political unrest, disruptions or delays in cross-border shipments and changes in economic conditions in countries in which our products are manufactured or where we sell products. this includes, for example, the uncertainty surrounding the implementation and effect of brexit, including changes to the legal and regulatory framework that apply to the united kingdom and its relationship with the european union. in addition, disease outbreaks, terrorist acts and military conflict have increased the risks of doing business abroad. these factors, among others, could affect our ability to manufacture products or procure materials, our ability to import products, our ability to sell products in international markets and our cost of doing business. if any of these or other factors make the conduct of business in a particular country undesirable or impractical, our business could be adversely affected. in addition, many of our imported products are subject to duties, tariffs or quotas that affect the cost and quantity of various types of goods imported into the united states and other countries. any country in which our products are produced or sold may eliminate, adjust or impose new quotas, duties, tariffs, safeguard measures, anti-dumping duties, cargo restrictions to prevent terrorism, restrictions on the transfer of currency, climate change legislation, product safety regulations or other charges or restrictions, any of which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.we could be subject to changes in tax rates, adoption of new tax laws or additional tax liabilities.we are subject to the tax laws in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions. current economic and political conditions make tax rules in any jurisdiction, including the united states, subject to significant change. there have been proposals to reform u.s. and foreign tax laws that could significantly impact how u.s. multinational corporations are taxed on foreign earnings. although we cannot predict whether or in what form these proposals will pass, several of the proposals considered, if enacted into law, could have an adverse impact on our income tax expense and cash flows. we earn a substantial portion of our income in foreign countries and are subject to the tax laws of those jurisdictions. if our capital or financing needs in the united states require us to repatriate earnings from foreign jurisdictions above our current levels, our effective income tax rates for the affected periods could be negatively impacted. 11table of contentsportions of our operations are subject to a reduced tax rate or are free of tax under various tax holidays and rulings that expire in whole or in part from time to time. these tax holidays and rulings may be extended when certain conditions are met, or terminated if certain conditions are not met. if the tax holidays and rulings are not extended, or if we fail to satisfy the conditions of the reduced tax rate, our future effective income tax rate would increase in the future.we are also subject to the examination of our tax returns by the united states internal revenue service (irs) and other tax authorities. we regularly assess the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for income taxes. although we believe our tax provisions are adequate, the final determination of tax audits and any related disputes could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals. the results of audits or related disputes could have an adverse effect on our financial statements for the period or periods for which the applicable final determinations are made. for example, the irs has assessed additional tax liabilities for 2011 and 2012 related to a foreign tax credit matter. we are currently contesting the matter in u.s. tax court. in addition to the risk of additional tax for these years, if this litigation is adversely determined and the irs was to seek similar adjustments in subsequent years, we could be subject to significant additional tax liabilities. additionally, we and our subsidiaries are engaged in a number of intercompany transactions across multiple tax jurisdictions. although we believe we have clearly reflected the economics of these transactions and the proper local transfer pricing documentation is in place, tax authorities may propose and sustain adjustments that could result in changes that may impact our mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates.if one or more of our counterparty financial institutions default on their obligations to us or fail, we may incur significant losses.as part of our hedging activities, we enter into transactions involving derivative financial instruments, which may include forward contracts, commodity futures contracts, option contracts, collars and swaps with various financial institutions. in addition, we have significant amounts of cash, cash equivalents and other investments on deposit or in accounts with banks or other financial institutions in the united states and abroad. as a result, we are exposed to the risk of default by or failure of counterparty financial institutions. the risk of counterparty default or failure may be heightened during economic downturns and periods of uncertainty in the financial markets. if one of our counterparties were to become insolvent or file for bankruptcy, our ability to recover losses incurred as a result of default or our assets that are deposited or held in accounts with such counterparty may be limited by the counterpartys liquidity or the applicable laws governing the insolvency or bankruptcy proceedings. in the event of default or failure of one or more of our counterparties, we could incur significant losses, which could negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition.we rely on a concentrated source base of contract manufacturers to supply a significant portion of our footwear products.nike is supplied by approximately 142 footwear factories located in 15 countries. we do not own or operate any of our own footwear manufacturing facilities and depend upon independent contract manufacturers to manufacture all of the footwear products we sell. in fiscal 2016, five footwear contract manufacturers each accounted for greater than 10% of fiscal 2016 footwear production and in aggregate accounted for approximately 69% of nike brand footwear production in fiscal 2016. our ability to meet our customers' needs depends on our ability to maintain a steady supply of products from our independent contract manufacturers. if one or more of our significant suppliers were to sever their relationship with us or significantly alter the terms of our relationship, we may not be able to obtain replacement products in a timely manner, which could have a material adverse effect on our sales, financial condition or results of operations. additionally, if any of our primary contract manufacturers fail to make timely shipments, do not meet our quality standards or otherwise fail to deliver us product in accordance with our plans, there could be a material adverse effect on our results of operations.our products are subject to risks associated with overseas sourcing, manufacturing and financing.the principal materials used in our apparel products  natural and synthetic fabrics and threads, specialized performance fabrics designed to efficiently wick moisture away from the body, retain heat or repel rain and/or snow as well as plastic and metal hardware  are available in countries where our manufacturing takes place. the principal materials used in our footwear products  natural and synthetic rubber, plastic compounds, foam cushioning materials, natural and synthetic leather, natural and synthetic fabrics and threads, nylon, canvas and polyurethane films  are also locally available to manufacturers. both our apparel and footwear products are dependent upon the ability of our unaffiliated contract manufacturers to locate, train, employ and retain adequate personnel. nike contractors and suppliers buy raw materials and are subject to wage rates that are oftentimes regulated by the governments of the countries in which our products are manufactured.there could be a significant disruption in the supply of fabrics or raw materials from current sources or, in the event of a disruption, our contract manufacturers might not be able to locate alternative suppliers of materials of comparable quality at an acceptable price or at all. further, our unaffiliated contract manufacturers have experienced and may continue to experience in the future, unexpected increases in work wages, whether government mandated or otherwise and increases in compliance costs due to governmental regulation concerning certain metals used in the manufacturing of our products. in addition, we cannot be certain that our unaffiliated manufacturers will be able to fill our orders in a timely manner. if we experience significant increases in demand, or reductions in the availability of materials, or need to replace an existing manufacturer, there can be no assurance that additional supplies of fabrics or raw materials or additional manufacturing capacity will be available when required on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all, or that any supplier or manufacturer would allocate sufficient capacity to us in order to meet our requirements. in addition, even if we are able to expand existing or find new manufacturing or sources of materials, we may encounter delays in production and added costs as a result of the time it takes to train suppliers and manufacturers in our methods, products, quality control standards and labor, health and safety standards. any delays, interruption or increased costs in labor or wages, or the supply of materials or manufacture of our products could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet retail customer and consumer demand for our products and result in lower revenues and net income both in the short- and long-term.because independent manufacturers make a majority of our products outside of our principal sales markets, our products must be transported by third parties over large geographic distances. delays in the shipment or delivery of our products due to the availability of transportation, work stoppages, port strikes, infrastructure congestion or other factors, and costs and delays associated with consolidating or transitioning between manufacturers, could adversely impact our financial performance. in addition, manufacturing delays or unexpected demand for our products may require us to use faster, but more expensive, transportation methods such as air freight, which could adversely affect our profit margins. the cost of oil is a significant component in manufacturing and transportation costs, so increases in the price of petroleum products can adversely affect our profit margins.12table of contentsin addition, sojitz america performs significant import-export financing services for the company. during fiscal 2016, sojitz america provided financing and purchasing services for nike brand products sold in certain nike markets including argentina, uruguay, brazil, canada, india, south africa and thailand (collectively the sojitz markets), excluding products produced and sold in the same country. any failure of sojitz america to provide these services or any failure of sojitz americas banks could disrupt our ability to acquire products from our suppliers and to deliver products to our customers in the sojitz markets. such a disruption could result in canceled orders that would adversely affect sales and profitability.our success depends on our global distribution facilities.we distribute our products to customers directly from the factory and through distribution centers located throughout the world. our ability to meet customer expectations, manage inventory, complete sales and achieve objectives for operating efficiencies and growth, particularly in emerging markets, depends on the proper operation of our distribution facilities, the development or expansion of additional distribution capabilities and the timely performance of services by third parties (including those involved in shipping product to and from our distribution facilities). our distribution facilities could be interrupted by information technology problems and disasters such as earthquakes or fires. any significant failure in our distribution facilities could result in an adverse effect on our business. we maintain business interruption insurance, but it may not adequately protect us from adverse effects that could be caused by significant disruptions in our distribution facilities.we rely significantly on information technology to operate our business, including our supply chain and retail operations, and any failure, inadequacy or interruption of that technology could harm our ability to effectively operate our business.we are heavily dependent on information technology systems and networks, including the internet and third-party hosted services (information technology systems), across our supply chain, including product design, production, forecasting, ordering, manufacturing, transportation, sales and distribution, as well as for processing financial information for external and internal reporting purposes, retail operations and other business activities. our information technology systems are critical to many of our operating activities and our business processes and may be negatively impacted by any service interruption or shutdown. for example, our ability to effectively manage and maintain our inventory and to ship products to customers on a timely basis depends significantly on the reliability of these information technology systems. over a number of years, we have implemented information technology systems in all of the geographical regions in which we operate. our work to integrate, secure and enhance these systems and related processes in our global operations is ongoing and nike will continue to invest in these efforts. the failure of these systems to operate effectively, including as a result of security breaches, viruses, hackers or other causes, or our failure to properly maintain, protect, repair or upgrade our systems, or problems with transitioning to upgraded or replacement systems could cause delays in product fulfillment and reduced efficiency of our operations, could require significant capital investments to remediate the problem and may have an adverse effect on our reputation, results of operations and financial condition.we also use information technology systems to process financial information and results of operations for internal reporting purposes and to comply with regulatory financial reporting, legal and tax requirements. if our information technology systems suffer severe damage, disruption or shutdown and our business continuity plans do not effectively resolve the issues in a timely manner, we could experience delays in reporting our financial results, which could result in lost revenues and profits, as well as reputational damage. furthermore, we depend on information technology systems and personal data collection and use for digital marketing, digital commerce, consumer engagement and the marketing and use of our digital products and services. we also rely on our ability to engage in electronic communications throughout the world between and among our employees as well as with other third parties, including customers, suppliers, vendors and consumers. any interruption in our information technology systems may impede our ability to engage in the digital space and result in lost revenues, damage to our reputation, and loss of users.the market for prime real estate is competitive.our ability to effectively obtain real estate to open new retail stores and otherwise conduct our operations, both domestically and internationally, depends on the availability of real estate that meets our criteria for traffic, square footage, co-tenancies, lease economics, demographics and other factors. we also must be able to effectively renew our existing real estate leases. in addition, from time to time, we seek to downsize, consolidate, reposition or close some of our real estate locations, which may require modification of an existing lease. failure to secure adequate new locations or successfully modify leases for existing locations, or failure to effectively manage the profitability of our existing fleet of retail stores, could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.additionally, the economic environment may at times make it difficult to determine the fair market rent of real estate properties domestically and internationally. this could impact the quality of our decisions to exercise lease options at previously negotiated rents and to renew expiring leases at negotiated rents. any adverse effect on the quality of these decisions could impact our ability to retain real estate locations adequate to meet our targets or efficiently manage the profitability of our existing fleet of stores, which could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.extreme weather conditions and natural disasters could negatively impact our operating results and financial condition.extreme weather conditions in the areas in which our retail stores, suppliers, customers, distribution centers and vendors are located could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition. moreover, natural disasters such as earthquakes, hurricanes and tsunamis, whether occurring in the united states or abroad, and their related consequences and effects, including energy shortages and public health issues, could disrupt our operations, the operations of our vendors and other suppliers or result in economic instability that may negatively impact our operating results and financial condition.our financial results may be adversely affected if substantial investments in businesses and operations fail to produce expected returns.from time to time, we may invest in technology, business infrastructure, new businesses, product offering and manufacturing innovation and expansion of existing businesses, such as our retail operations, which require substantial cash investments and management attention. we believe cost-effective investments are essential to business growth and profitability. however, significant investments are subject to typical risks and uncertainties inherent in developing a new business or expanding an existing business. the failure of any significant investment to provide expected returns or profitability could have a material adverse effect on our financial results and divert management attention from more profitable business operations.13table of contentswe are subject to periodic litigation and other regulatory proceedings, which could result in unexpected expense of time and resources.from time to time we are called upon to defend ourselves against lawsuits and regulatory actions relating to our business. due to the inherent uncertainties of litigation and regulatory proceedings, we cannot accurately predict the ultimate outcome of any such proceedings. an unfavorable outcome could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. in addition, any significant litigation in the future, regardless of its merits, could divert managements attention from our operations and result in substantial legal fees.we depend on key personnel, the loss of whom would harm our business.our future success will depend in part on the continued service of key executive officers and personnel. the loss of the services of any key individual could harm our business. our future success also depends on our ability to recruit, retain and engage our personnel sufficiently, both to maintain our current business and to execute our strategic initiatives. competition for employees in our industry is intense and we may not be successful in attracting and retaining such personnel.the sale of a large number of shares of common stock by our principal stockholder could depress the market price of our common stock.as of june 30, 2016, swoosh, llc beneficially owned more than 78% of our classa common stock. if, on june 30, 2016, all of these shares were converted into class b common stock, the commensurate ownership percentage of our class b common stock would be approximately 16%. the shares are available for resale, subject to the requirements of the u.s. securities laws and the terms of the limited liability company agreement governing swoosh, llc. the sale or prospect of a sale of a substantial number of these shares could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock. swoosh, llc was formed by philip h. knight, our chairman emeritus, to hold the majority of his shares of class a common stock. on june 30, 2016, mr. knight sold his voting interest in swoosh, llc to a trust controlled by his son and nike director, travis knight.changes in our credit ratings or macroeconomic conditions may affect our liquidity, increasing borrowing costs and limiting our financing options.our long-term debt is currently rated investment grade by standard & poors and moodys investors service. if our credit ratings are lowered, borrowing costs for future long-term debt or short-term credit facilities may increase and our financing options, including our access to the unsecured credit market, could be limited. we may also be subject to restrictive covenants that would reduce our flexibility to, among other things, incur additional indebtedness, make restricted payments, pledge assets as security, make investments, loans, advances, guarantees and acquisitions, undergo fundamental changes and enter into transactions with affiliates. failure to comply with such covenants could result in a default, and as a result, the commitments of our lenders under our credit agreements may be terminated and the maturity of amounts owed may be accelerated. in addition, macroeconomic conditions, such as increased volatility or disruption in the credit markets, could adversely affect our ability to refinance existing debt.if our internal controls are ineffective, our operating results could be adversely affected.our internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements because of its inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error, the circumvention or overriding of controls or fraud. even effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements. if we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls, including any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or if we experience difficulties in their implementation, our business and operating results could be harmed and we could fail to meet our financial reporting obligations. if our estimates or judgments relating to our critical accounting policies prove to be incorrect, our operating results could be adversely affected.the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, as provided in managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations. the results of these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets, liabilities and equity, and the amount of revenue and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. significant assumptions and estimates used in preparing our consolidated financial statements include those related to revenue recognition, allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable, inventories, contingent payments under endorsement contracts, accounting for property, plant and equipment and definite-lived assets and goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets. our operating results may be adversely affected if our assumptions change or if actual circumstances differ from those in our assumptions, which could cause our operating results to fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors, resulting in a decline in the price of our class b common stock.anti-takeover provisions may impair an acquisition of the company or reduce the price of our common stock.there are provisions of our articles of incorporation and oregon law that are intended to protect shareholder interests by providing the board of directors a means to attempt to deny coercive takeover attempts or to negotiate with a potential acquirer in order to obtain more favorable terms. such provisions include a control share acquisition statute, a freeze-out statute, two classes of stock that vote separately on certain issues, and the fact that holders of classa common stock elect three-quarters of the board of directors rounded down to the next whole number. however, such provisions could discourage, delay or prevent an unsolicited merger, acquisition or other change in control of our company that some shareholders might believe to be in their best interests or in which shareholders might receive a premium for their common stock over the prevailing market price. these provisions could also discourage proxy contests for control of the company.14table of contentswe may fail to meet market expectations, which could cause the price of our stock to decline.our class b common stock is traded publicly, and at any given time various securities analysts follow our financial results and issue reports on us. these reports include information about our historical financial results as well as analysts estimates of our future performance. analysts estimates are based upon their own opinions and are often different from our estimates or expectations. if our operating results are below the estimates or expectations of public market analysts and investors, our stock price could decline. in the past, securities class action litigation has been brought against nike and other companies following a decline in the market price of their securities. if our stock price is volatile, we may become involved in this type of litigation in the future. any litigation could result in substantial costs and a diversion of managements attention and resources that are needed to successfully run our business.15table of contentsitem1b. unresolved staff commentsnone.item2. propertiesthe following is a summary of principal properties

and- driving growth in our higher gross margin dtc business, led by nike.com, as part of an integrated marketplace growth strategy across our dtc and wholesale operations.optimizing selling and administrative expense by focusing on:- investments in consumer engagement that drive economic returns in the form of incremental revenue and gross profit;- infrastructure investments that improve the efficiency and effectiveness of our operations; and- investments in key areas of future growth, including our dtc business.managing working capital efficiency; anddeploying capital effectively.through execution of this strategy, our long-term financial goals through fiscal 2020, on average per year, are as follows:high single-digit to low-double digit revenue growth;mid-teens earnings per share growth;high-twenties to low-thirties percentage rate of return on invested capital; free cash flow growing faster than net income; andsustainable, profitable, long-term growth through effective management of our diversified portfolio of businesses.over the past ten years, we have achieved many of our financial goals. during this time, revenues and diluted earnings per common share for nike, inc., inclusive of both continuing and discontinued operations, have grown 8% and 13%, respectively, on an annual compounded basis. we expanded gross margin by approximately 220 basis points and our return on invested capital has increased from 22.6% to 29.7%.on november 19, 2015, we announced a two-for-one stock split of both nike class a and class b common stock. the stock split was in the form of a 100 percent stock dividend payable on december 23, 2015 to shareholders of record at the close of business on december 9, 2015. common stock began trading at the split-adjusted price on december 24, 2015. all share and per share amounts presented reflect the stock split. our fiscal 2016 results demonstrated the power of the nike, inc. portfolio to deliver continued growth and expanding profitability. despite significant foreign currency headwinds, we achieved record revenues and earnings per share for fiscal 2016. nike, inc. revenues grew 6% to $32.4 billion, gross margin expanded 20 basis points, net income increased 15% and diluted earnings per common share grew 17% to $2.16. we also delivered strong cash returns to shareholders while investing for long-term growth.earnings before interest and income taxes ("ebit") increased 10% for fiscal 2016, driven by revenue growth and gross margin expansion, while selling and administrative expense was flat as a percent of revenues. the increase in revenues was attributable to growth for nearly every nikebrand geography and across most key categories and product types. this broad-based growth was primarily fueled by:innovative performance and sportswear products, incorporating proprietary technology platforms such as nike air, free, zoom, lunar, flywire, dri-fit and flyknit; deep brand connections with consumers through our category offense, reinforced by investments in endorsements by high-profile athletes, sports teams and leagues, high-impact marketing around global sporting events and digital marketing; andstrong category retail presentation online and at nike-owned and retail partner stores. converse revenues and ebit decreased 1% and 6%, respectively, as growth in direct distribution markets was more than offset by the negative impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates.gross margin increased primarily due to higher full-price average selling price and the favorable impact of growth in our higher-margin dtc businesses, partially offset by higher product costs, primarily due to shifts in mix to higher-cost products and labor input cost inflation, higher off-price mix and unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates.21table of contentsfor fiscal 2016, the growth in net income was positively affected by a year-over-year decrease in our effective tax rate of 350 basis points primarily due to an increase in the proportion of earnings from operations outside the united states, which are generally subject to a lower tax rate. diluted earnings per common share grew at a higher rate than net income due to a 1% decrease in the weighted average diluted common shares outstanding, driven by our share repurchase program.while foreign currency markets remain volatile, we continue to see opportunities to drive future growth and profitability, and remain committed to effectively managing our business to achieve our financial goals over the long-term by executing against the operational strategies outlined above.results of operations(dollars in millions, except per share data)fiscal 2016fiscal 2015% changefiscal 2014% changerevenues$32,376$30,6016%$27,79910%cost of sales17,40516,5345%15,3538%gross profit14,97114,0676%12,44613%gross margin %46.2%46.0%44.8%demand creation expense3,2783,2132%3,0316%operating overhead expense7,1916,6798%5,73516%total selling and administrative expense10,4699,8926%8,76613%% of revenues32.3%32.3%31.5%interest expense (income), net192833other (income) expense, net(140)(58)103income before income taxes4,6234,20510%3,54419%income tax expense863932-7%85110%effective tax rate18.7%22.2%24.0%net income$3,760$3,27315%$2,69322%diluted earnings per common share$2.16$1.8517%$1.4924%22table of contentsconsolidated operating resultsrevenues(dollars inmillions)fiscal 2016fiscal 2015(1)% change% change excluding currency changes(2)fiscal 2014(1)% change% change excluding currency changes(2)nike, inc. revenues:nike brand revenues by:footwear$19,871$18,3188%15%$16,20813%17%apparel9,0678,6375%11%8,1097%10%equipment1,4961,631-8%-2%1,670-2%1%global brand divisions(3)73115-37%-30%125-8%-2%total nike brand revenues30,50728,7016%13%26,11210%14%converse1,9551,982-1%2%1,68418%21%corporate(4)(86)(82)3total nike, inc. revenues$32,376$30,6016%12%$27,79910%14%supplemental nike brand revenues details:nike brand revenues by:sales to wholesale customers$22,577$21,9523%9%$20,6836%10%sales direct to consumer7,8576,63418%25%5,30425%29%global brand divisions(3)73115-37%-30%125-8%-2%total nike brand revenues$30,507$28,7016%13%$26,11210%14%nike brand revenues on a wholesale equivalent basis:(5)sales to wholesale customers$22,577$21,9523%9%$20,6836%10%sales from our wholesale operations to direct to consumer operations4,6723,88120%27%3,10725%29%total nike brand wholesale equivalent revenues$27,249$25,8335%12%$23,7909%13%nike brand wholesale equivalent revenues by:(5)men's$15,410$14,6895%11%$13,9965%9%women's6,2965,73210%17%4,97615%20%young athletes'4,5604,3016%11%3,73715%19%others(6)9831,111-12%-4%1,0813%7%total nike brand wholesale equivalent revenues$27,249$25,8335%12%$23,7909%13%nike brand wholesale equivalent revenues by:(5)running$5,017$4,8633%10%$4,6265%9%nike basketball1,3781,385-1%2%1,17818%19%jordan brand2,7532,32918%21%1,94120%22%football (soccer)2,1432,250-5%7%2,414-7%-2%mens training2,6112,5453%6%2,4852%4%womens training1,3441,2815%11%1,14512%16%action sports711737-4%3%7380%4%sportswear7,5136,60414%22%5,74415%20%golf706769-8%-6%788-2%0%others(7)3,0733,0700%6%2,73112%17%total nike brand wholesale equivalent revenues$27,249$25,8335%12%$23,7909%13%23table of contents(1)certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to fiscal 2016 presentation. these changes had no impact on previously reported results of operations or shareholders' equity.

higher revenues for the nike brand. every nike brand geography grew revenues for fiscal 2016 as our category offense continued to deliver innovative products, deep brand connections and compelling retail experiences to consumers online and at nike-owned and retail partner stores, driving strong demand for nike brand products. north america contributed approximately 4 percentage points of the increase in nike, inc. revenues, while greater china and western europe each contributed approximately 3 percentage points, emerging markets contributed approximately 2 percentage points and central & eastern europe contributed approximately 1 percentage point. excluding the effects of changes in currency exchange rates, nike brand footwear and apparel revenues increased 15% and 11%, respectively, for fiscal 2016, while nike brand equipment revenues decreased 2%. the increase in nike brand footwear revenues for fiscal 2016 was driven by growth in nearly every key category, including strong growth in sportswear, the jordan brand and running. footwear unit sales for fiscal 2016 increased 9%, with higher average selling price (asp) per pair contributing approximately 6 percentage points of footwear revenue growth. higher asp per pair was driven by higher full-price asp, and to a lesser extent, the favorable impact of an increase in the proportion of revenues from our higher-priced dtc business. the constant-currency increase in nike brand apparel revenues for fiscal 2016 was attributable to growth in most key categories, led by sportswear, men's training, running, women's training and football (soccer). apparel unit sales for fiscal 2016 increased 7%. higher asp per unit contributed approximately 4 percentage points of apparel revenue growth, primarily due to higher full-price asp and growth in our higher-priced dtc business.while wholesale revenues remain the largest component of overall nike brand revenues, we continue to expand our dtc businesses in each of our geographies. nike brand dtc operations include nike-owned in-line and factory stores, as well as online sales through nike-owned websites. for fiscal 2016, dtc revenues represented approximately 26% of our total nike brand revenues. on a currency-neutral basis, dtc revenues increased 25% for fiscal 2016, driven by strong online sales growth, the addition of new stores and comparable store sales growth of 10%. comparable store sales include revenues from nike-owned in-line and factory stores for which all three of the following requirements have been met: (1) the store has been open at least one year, (2) square footage has not changed by more than 15% within the past year and (3) the store has not been permanently repositioned within the past year. online sales through nike-owned websites, which are not included in comparable store sales, grew 51% in fiscal 2016. for fiscal 2016, online sales represented approximately 22% of our total nike brand dtc revenues.on a wholesale equivalent basis and excluding the effects of changes in currency exchange rates, fiscal 2016 nike brand mens revenues increased 11%, driven by growth in sportswear and the jordan brand, while women's revenues increased 17%, led by sportswear, running and women's training. revenues for our young athletes' business increased 11%, with growth across multiple categories, most notably the jordan brand.fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014 on a currency-neutral basis, revenues from nike, inc. continuing operations grew 14% for fiscal 2015, driven by increases in revenues for both the nike brand and converse. every nike brand geography delivered higher revenues for fiscal 2015 as our category offense continued to deliver innovative products, deep brand connections and compelling retail experiences to consumers. north america contributed 5 percentage points of the increase in nike, inc. revenues, while western europe contributed 4 percentage points, greater china contributed 2 percentage points and central & eastern europe, emerging markets and converse each contributed 1 percentage point. excluding the effects of changes in currency exchange rates, nike brand footwear and apparel revenues increased 17% and 10%, respectively, while nike brand equipment revenues increased 1% during fiscal 2015. the increase in nike brand footwear revenues for fiscal 2015 was driven by strong performance in sportswear, the jordan brand, running, nike basketball and football (soccer). footwear unit sales in fiscal 2015 increased 9%. higher asp per pair contributed approximately 8 percentage points of footwear revenue growth, driven primarily by higher full-price asp, and to a lesser extent, the favorable impact of growth in our higher-priced dtc business. the constant-currency increase in nike brand apparel revenues for fiscal 2015 was driven by growth in most key categories, led by sportswear, running and women's training, which were partially offset by a decline in football (soccer) due largely to the comparison to significant sales of replica apparel in advance of the world cup in 2014. fiscal 2015 unit sales of apparel increased 8% with higher asp per unit contributing approximately 2 percentage points of apparel revenue growth, driven primarily by growth in our higher-priced dtc business.for fiscal 2015, dtc revenues represented approximately 23% of our total nike brand revenues compared to 20% in fiscal 2014. on a currency-neutral basis, dtc revenues grew 29% for fiscal 2015, driven by strong comparable store sales growth of 16%, significant online sales growth and the addition of new stores. online sales through nike-owned websites grew 59% in fiscal 2015. online sales represented approximately 18% of our total nike brand dtc revenues for fiscal 2015 compared to 15% for fiscal 2014.24table of contentson a wholesale equivalent basis and excluding the effects of changes in currency exchange rates, fiscal 2015 nike brand mens revenues increased 9%, driven by growth in our sportswear, the jordan brand, nike basketball and running categories. womens revenues accelerated in fiscal 2015, achieving 20% growth primarily due to increases in sportswear, running and women's training categories. revenues in our young athletes' business increased 19% as a result of continued efforts to expand footwear and apparel offerings for this group across multiple categories, particularly the jordan brand.futures ordersfutures orders for nike brand footwear and apparel scheduled for delivery from june through november 2016 totaled $14.9 billion and were 8% higher than the orders reported for the comparable prior year period. nike brand reported futures include (1) orders from external wholesale customers and (2) internal orders from our dtc in-line stores and e-commerce operations which are reflected at prices that are comparable to prices charged to external wholesale customers. the u.s.dollar futures orders amount is calculated based upon our internal forecast of the currency exchange rates under which our revenues will be translated during this period.excluding the impact of currency changes, futures orders increased 11%, with unit orders increasing 4% and average selling price per unit contributing approximately 7 percentage points of growth.by geography, futures orders growth was as follows:reportedfutures

foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.the reported futures orders growth is not necessarily indicative of our expectation of revenue growth during this period. this is due to year-over-year changes in shipment timing, changes in the mix of orders between futures and at-once orders, and because the fulfillment of certain orders may fall outside of the schedule noted above. in addition, exchange rate fluctuations as well as differing levels of order cancellations, discounts and returns can cause differences in the comparisons between futures orders and actual revenues. moreover, a portion of our revenue is not derived from futures orders, including sales of at-once and closeout nike brand footwear and apparel, all sales of nike brand equipment, the difference between retail sales and internal orders from our dtc in-line stores and e-commerce operations, and sales from converse, nike golf and hurley.gross margin(dollars in millions)fiscal 2016fiscal 2015% changefiscal

participating in nike brand sales activity. each nike brand geographic segment operates predominantly in one industry: the design, development, marketing and selling of athletic footwear, apparel and equipment. the companys reportable operating segments for the nike brand are: north america, western europe, central& eastern europe, greater china, japan and emerging markets, and include results for the nike, jordan and hurley brands. the companys nike brand dtc operations are managed within each geographic operating segment. converse is also a reportable segment for the company and operates in one industry: the design, marketing, licensing and selling of casual sneakers, apparel and accessories.as part of our centrally managed foreign exchange risk management program, standard foreign currency rates are assigned twice per year to each nike brand entity in our geographic operating segments and converse. these rates are set approximately nine and twelve months in advance of the future selling seasons to which they relate (specifically, for each currency, one standard rate applies to the fall and holiday selling seasons and one standard rate applies to the spring and summer selling seasons) based on average market spot rates in the calendar month preceding the date they are established. inventories and cost of sales for geographic operating segments and converse reflect use of these standard rates to record non-functional currency product purchases into the entitys functional currency. differences between assigned standard foreign currency rates and actual market rates are included in corporate together with foreign currency hedge gains and losses generated from our centrally managed foreign exchange risk management program and other conversion gains and losses.the breakdown of revenues is as follows:(dollarsinmillions)fiscal 2016fiscal 2015(1)% change% change excluding currency changes(2)fiscal 2014(1)% change% change excluding currency

higher revenues in most key categories, led by the jordan brand, sportswear, running and women's training, partially offset by a slight decline in nike basketball. fiscal 2016 unit sales of footwear increased 8%. higher average selling price (asp) per pair contributed approximately 2 percentage points of footwear revenue growth, driven by higher full-price asp and the favorable impact of an increase in the proportion of revenues from our higher-priced dtc business, partially offset by higher off-price mix.apparel revenue growth for fiscal 2016 was primarily driven by our sportswear and men's training categories. for fiscal 2016, unit sales of apparel grew 7%. higher asp per unit contributed approximately 1 percentage point of apparel revenue growth, primarily attributable to higher full-price asp. reported ebit increased 3% for fiscal 2016 as higher revenues were largely offset by lower gross margin and higher selling and administrative expense as a percent of revenues. gross margin declined 80 basis points as higher off-price mix, higher warehousing and inventory obsolescence costs, as well as higher product input costs more than offset higher full-price asp. selling and

lessen both the positive and negative effects of currency fluctuations on our consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows. we manage global foreign exchange risk centrally on a portfolio basis to address those risks that are material to nike, inc. we manage these exposures by taking advantage of natural offsets and currency correlations that exist within the portfolio and, where practical and material, by hedging a portion of the remaining exposures using derivative instruments such as forward contracts and options. as described below, the implementation of the nike trading company ("ntc") and our foreign currency adjustment program enhanced our ability to manage our foreign exchange risk by increasing the natural offsets and currency correlation benefits that exist within our portfolio of foreign exchange exposures. our hedging policy is designed to partially or entirely offset the impact of exchange rate changes on the underlying net exposures being hedged. where exposures are hedged, our program has the effect of delaying the impact of exchange rate movements on our consolidated financial statements; the length of the delay is dependent upon hedge horizons. we do not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes.transactional exposureswe conduct business in various currencies and have transactions which subject us to foreign currency risk. our most significant transactional foreign currency exposures are:product costs  nikes product costs are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currencies in the following ways:1.product purchases denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the transacting entity:a.certain nike entities purchase product from the ntc, a wholly-owned sourcing hub that buys nike branded products from third-party factories, predominantly in u.s. dollars. the ntc, whose functional currency is the u.s.dollar, then sells the products to nike entities in their respective functional currencies. when the ntc sells to a nike entity with a different functional currency, the result is a foreign currency exposure for the ntc.b.other nike entities purchase product directly from third-party factories in u.s. dollars. these purchases generate a foreign currency exposure for those nike entities with a functional currency other than the u.s. dollar.in both purchasing scenarios, a weaker u.s.dollar decreases the inventory cost incurred by nike whereas a stronger u.s.dollar increases its cost.35table of contents2.factory input costs: nike operates a foreign currency adjustment program with certain factories. the program is designed to more effectively manage foreign currency risk by assuming certain of the factories foreign currency exposures, some of which are natural offsets to our existing foreign currency exposures. under this program, our payments to these factories are adjusted for rate fluctuations in the basket of currencies (factory currency exposure index) in which the labor, materials and overhead costs incurred by the factories in the production of nike branded products (factory input costs) are denominated.for the currency within the factory currency exposure indices that is the local or functional currency of the factory, the currency rate fluctuation affecting the product cost is recorded within inventories and is recognized in cost of sales when the related product is sold to a third-party. all currencies within the indices, excluding the u.s.dollar and the local or functional currency of the factory, are recognized as embedded derivative contracts and are recorded at fair value through other (income) expense, net. refer to note16  risk management and derivatives in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional detail.as an offset to the impacts of the fluctuating u.s.dollar on our non-functional currency denominated product purchases described above, a strengthening u.s.dollar against the foreign currencies within the factory currency exposure indices decreases nikes u.s.dollar inventory cost. conversely, a weakening u.s.dollar against the indexed foreign currencies increases our inventory cost.non-functional currency denominated external sales  a portion of our western europe and central& eastern europe geography revenues, as well as a portion of our converse european operations revenues, are earned in currencies other than the euro (e.g. the british pound) but are recognized at a subsidiary that uses the euro as its functional currency. these sales generate a foreign currency exposure.other costs  non-functional currency denominated costs, such as endorsement contracts, also generate foreign currency risk, though to a lesser extent. in certain cases, the company has also entered into other contractual agreements which have payments that are indexed to foreign currencies and create embedded derivative contracts that are recorded at fair value throughother (income) expense, net. refer to note16  risk management and derivatives in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional detail.non-functional currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities  our global subsidiaries have various assets and liabilities, primarily receivables and payables, including intercompany receivables and payables, denominated in currencies other than their functional currencies. these balance sheet items are subject to re-measurement which may create fluctuations in other (income) expense, net within our consolidated results of operations.managing transactional exposurestransactional exposures are managed on a portfolio basis within our foreign currency risk management program. we manage these exposures by taking advantage of natural offsets and currency correlations that exist within the portfolio and may also elect to use currency forward and option contracts to hedge a portion of the remaining effect of exchange rate fluctuations on probable forecasted future cash flows, including certain product cost purchase exposures, non-functional currency denominated external sales and other costs described above. generally, these are accounted for as cash flow hedges in accordance with the accounting standards for derivatives and hedging, except for hedges of the embedded derivatives component of the product cost exposures as discussed below.certain currency forward contracts used to manage the foreign exchange exposure of non-functional currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities subject to re-measurement and the embedded derivative contracts discussed above are not formally designated as hedging instruments under the accounting standards for derivatives and hedging. accordingly, changes in fair value of these instruments are immediately recognized in other (income) expense, net and are intended to offset the foreign currency impact of the re-measurement of the related non-functional currency denominated asset or liability or the embedded derivative contract being hedged. refer to note6  fair value measurements and note16  risk management and derivatives in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional description of how the above financial instruments are valued and recorded as well as the fair value of outstanding derivatives at each reported period end.translational exposuresmany of our foreign subsidiaries operate in functional currencies other than the u.s. dollar. fluctuations in currency exchange rates create volatility in our reported results as we are required to translate the balance sheets, operational results and cash flows of these subsidiaries into u.s. dollars for consolidated reporting. the translation of foreign subsidiaries non-u.s.dollar denominated balance sheets into u.s. dollars for consolidated reporting results in a cumulative translation adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income within the consolidated statements of shareholders equity. in the translation of our consolidated statements of income, a weaker u.s.dollar in relation to foreign functional currencies benefits our consolidated earnings whereas a stronger u.s.dollar reduces our consolidated earnings. the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the translation of our consolidated revenues was a detriment of approximately $1,985 million and $1,171 million for the years ended may31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the translation of our income before income taxes was a detriment of approximately $449 million and $221 million for the years ended may31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.managing translational exposuresto minimize the impact of translating foreign currency denominated revenues and expenses into u.s. dollars for consolidated reporting, certain foreign subsidiaries use excess cash to purchase u.s.dollar denominated available-for-sale investments. the variable future cash flows associated with the purchase and subsequent sale of these u.s.dollar denominated securities at non-u.s.dollar functional currency subsidiaries creates a foreign currency exposure that qualifies for hedge accounting under the accounting standards for derivatives and hedging. we utilize forward contracts and/or options to mitigate the variability of the forecasted future purchases and sales of these u.s.dollar investments. the combination of the purchase and sale of the u.s.dollar investment and the hedging instrument has the effect of partially offsetting the year-over-year foreign currency translation impact on net earnings in the period the investments are sold. hedges of available-for-sale investments are accounted for as cash flow hedges. 36table of contentsrefer to note6  fair value measurements and note16  risk management and derivatives in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional description of how the above financial instruments are valued and recorded as well as the fair value of outstanding derivatives at each reported period end.we estimate the combination of translation of foreign currency-denominated profits from our international businesses and the year-over-year change in foreign currency related gains and losses included in other (income) expense, net had an unfavorable impact of approximately $423 million and $73 million on our income before income taxes for the years ended may31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.net investments in foreign subsidiarieswe are also exposed to the impact of foreign exchange fluctuations on our investments in wholly-owned foreign subsidiaries denominated in a currency other than the u.s.dollar, which could adversely impact the u.s.dollar value of these investments and therefore the value of future repatriated earnings. we have, in the past, hedged and may, in the future, hedge net investment positions in certain foreign subsidiaries to mitigate the effects of foreign exchange fluctuations on these net investments. these hedges are accounted for in accordance with the accounting standards for net investment hedges. there were no outstanding net investment hedges as of may31, 2016 and 2015. there were no cash flows from net investment hedge settlements for the years ended may 31, 2016 and 2015.liquidity and capital resourcescash flow activitycash provided by operations was $3,096 million for fiscal 2016 compared to $4,680 million for fiscal 2015. our primary source of operating cash flow for fiscal 2016 was net income of $3,760 million. our fiscal 2016 change in working capital was a net cash outflow of $1,580 million as compared to a net cash inflow of $256 million for fiscal 2015. the change in working capital was primarily due to a net decrease in the amount of cash collateral received as a result of hedging activities (refer to the credit risk section of note16  risk management and derivatives for additional detail). for fiscal 2016, cash collateral received from counterparties declined $863 million as compared to an increase in collateral received from counterparties of $968 million for fiscal 2015.cash used by investing activities was $1,034 million for fiscal 2016, compared to a $175 million use of cash for fiscal 2015.the primary driver of the increase in cash used by investing activities was the net change in short-term investments (including sales, maturities and purchases) from net sales/maturities to net purchases. in fiscal 2016, there were $57 million of net purchases of short-term investments compared to $935 million of net sales/maturities of short-term investments in the same period of fiscal 2015. additions to property, plant and equipment were $1,143 million for fiscal 2016 as compared to $963 million for fiscal 2015. the increase in additions to property, plant and equipment resulted from continued investments in infrastructure to support current and future growth, primarily relating to supply chain and corporate initiatives, as well as expansion of our dtc operations.in fiscal 2017, we plan to continue investing in our infrastructure to support future growth, as well as expand our digital capabilities. we anticipate investing approximately 4% of revenue, a portion of which will be used for the continued expansion of our corporate facilities, new dtc stores and digital capabilities.cash used by financing activities was $2,671 million for fiscal 2016 compared to $2,790 million for fiscal 2015, a decrease of $119 million, as increases in share repurchases and dividends were more than offset by the receipt of $981 million in net proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt in october 2015.in fiscal 2016, we purchased 55.4 million shares of nikes class b common stock for $3,238 million (an average price of $58.44). during the third quarter of fiscal 2016, we concluded the company's four-year, $8 billion share repurchase program approved by our board of directors in september 2012. under this program the company purchased a total of 197.1 million shares at a cost of $8 billion (an average price of $40.58 per share). following the completion of this program, the company began purchases under a four-year, $12 billion program approved by our board of directors in november 2015. of the total 55.4 million shares repurchased in fiscal 2016, 20.1 million shares were purchased under this new program at a cost of approximately $1,189 million (an average price of $59.21 per share). we continue to expect funding of share repurchases will come from operating cash flow, excess cash and/or debt. the timing and the amount of shares purchased will be dictated by our capital needs and stock market conditions.capital resourceson april 23, 2013, we filed a shelf registration statement (the "shelf") with the sec which permitted us to issue an unlimited amount of debt securities. on april 23, 2013, we issued $1.0 billion of senior notes with tranches maturing in 2023 and 2043. the 2023 senior notes were issued in an initial aggregate principal amount of $500 million at a 2.25% fixed, annual interest rate and will mature on may 1, 2023. the 2043 senior notes were issued in an initial aggregate principal amount of $500 million at a 3.625% fixed, annual interest rate and will mature on may 1, 2043. interest on the senior notes is payable semi-annually on may 1 and november 1 of each year. the issuance resulted in gross proceeds before expenses of $998 million. on october 29, 2015, we issued an additional $1.0 billion of senior notes at a 3.875% fixed, annual interest rate that will mature on november 1, 2045. interest on the senior notes is payable semi-annually on may 1 and november 1 of each year. the issuance resulted in proceeds before expenses of $991 million. the shelf expired on april 23, 2016. we plan to file a new shelf registration statement with the sec in july 2016.on august 28, 2015, we entered into a committed credit facility agreement with a syndicate of banks, which provides for up to $2 billion of borrowings. the facility matures august 28, 2020, with a one year extension option prior to any anniversary of the closing date, provided that in no event shall it extend beyond august 28, 2022. this facility replaces the prior $1 billion credit facility agreement entered into on november 1, 2011, which would have matured november 1, 2017. as of and for the periods ended may31, 2016 and 2015, we had no amounts outstanding under either committed credit facility.37table of contentswe currently have long-term debt ratings of aa- and a1 from standard and poor's corporation and moody's investor services, respectively. if our long-term debt ratings were to decline, the facility fee and interest rate under our committed credit facility would increase. conversely, if our long-term debt rating were to improve, the facility fee and interest rate would decrease. changes in our long-term debt rating would not trigger acceleration of maturity of any then-outstanding borrowings or any future borrowings under the committed credit facility. under this committed revolving credit facility, we have agreed to various covenants. these covenants include limits on our disposal of fixed assets, the amount of debt secured by liens we may incur, as well as limits on the indebtedness we can incur relative to our net worth. in the event we were to have any borrowings outstanding under this facility and failed to meet any covenant, and were unable to obtain a waiver from a majority of the banks in the syndicate, any borrowings would become immediately due and payable. as of may31, 2016, we were in full compliance with each of these covenants and believe it is unlikely we will fail to meet any of these covenants in the foreseeable future.liquidity is also provided by our $2 billion commercial paper program, which increased $1 billion during the second quarter of fiscal 2016. during the year ended may31, 2016, we did not issue commercial paper, and as of may31, 2016, there were no outstanding borrowings under this program. any future issuance of commercial paper or other debt securities during fiscal 2017 will depend on general corporate needs. we currently have short-term debt ratings of a1+ and p1 from standard and poor's corporation and moody's investor services, respectively.as of may31, 2016, we had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments totaling $5.5 billion, of which $4.6 billion was held by our foreign subsidiaries. included in cash and equivalents as of may 31, 2016 was $105 million of cash collateral received from counterparties as a result of hedging activity. cash equivalents and short-term investments consist primarily of deposits held at major banks, money market funds, commercial paper, corporate notes, u.s. treasury obligations, u.s. government sponsored enterprise obligations and other investment grade fixed income securities.our fixed income investments are exposed to both credit and interest rate risk.all of our investments are investment grade to minimize our credit risk.while individual securities have varying durations, as of may31, 2016, the weighted average remaining duration of our cash equivalents and short-term investments portfolio was 91days.to date we have not experienced difficulty accessing the credit markets or incurred higher interest costs. future volatility in the capital markets, however, may increase costs associated with issuing commercial paper or other debt instruments or affect our ability to access those markets. we believe that existing cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and cash generated by operations, together with access to external sources of funds as described above, will be sufficient to meet ourdomestic and foreigncapital needs in the foreseeable future.we utilize a variety of tax planning and financing strategies to manage our worldwide cash and deploy funds to locations where they are needed. we routinely repatriate a portion of our foreign earnings for which u.s. taxes have previously been provided. we also indefinitely reinvest a significant portion of our foreign earnings, and our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate these earnings. should we require additional capital in the united states, we may elect to repatriate indefinitely reinvested foreign funds or raise capital in the united states through debt. if we were to repatriate indefinitely reinvested foreign funds, we would be required to accrue and pay additional u.s. taxes less applicable foreign tax credits. if we elect to raise capital in the united states through debt, we would incur additional interest expense.off-balance sheet arrangementsin connection with various contracts and agreements, we routinely provide indemnification relating to the enforceability of intellectual property rights, coverage for legal issues that arise and other items where we are acting as the guarantor. currently, we have several such agreements in place. however, based on our historical experience and the estimated probability of future loss, we have determined that the fair value of such indemnification is not material to our financial position or results of operations.38table of contentscontractual obligationsour significant long-term contractual obligations as of may31, 2016 and significant endorsement contracts, including related marketing commitments, entered into through the date of this report are as follows:description of commitmentcash payments due during the year ending may31,(in millions)20172018201920202021thereaftertotaloperating

are based on outstanding principal amounts, applicable fixed interest rates or currently effective interest rates as of may31, 2016 (if variable), timing of scheduled payments and the term of the debt obligations.(2)the amounts listed for endorsement contracts represent approximate amounts of base compensation and minimum guaranteed royalty fees we are obligated to pay athlete, sport team and league endorsers of our products. actual payments under some contracts may be higher than the amounts listed as these contracts provide for bonuses to be paid to the endorsers based upon athletic achievements and/or royalties on product sales in future periods. actual payments under some contracts may also be lower as these contracts include provisions for reduced payments if athletic performance declines in future periods.in addition to the cash payments, we are obligated to furnish our endorsers with nike product for their use. it is not possible to determine how much we will spend on this product on an annual basis as the contracts generally do not stipulate a specific amount of cash to be spent on the product. the amount of product provided to the endorsers will depend on many factors, including general playing conditions, the number of sporting events in which they participate and our own decisions regarding product and marketing initiatives. in addition, the costs to design, develop, source and purchase the products furnished to the endorsers are incurred over a period of time and are not necessarily tracked separately from similar costs incurred for products sold to customers.(3)we generally order product at least four to five months in advance of sale based primarily on futures orders received from external wholesale customers and internal orders from our dtc in-line stores and e-commerce operations. the amounts listed for product purchase obligations represent agreements (including open purchase orders) to purchase products in the ordinary course of business that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms. in some cases, prices are subject to change throughout the production process.(4)other purchase obligations primarily include service and marketing commitments, including marketing commitments associated with endorsement contracts, made in the ordinary course of business. the amounts represent the minimum payments required by legally binding contracts and agreements that specify all significant terms, including open purchase orders for non-product purchases.in addition to the above, we have long-term obligations for uncertain tax positions and various post-retirement benefits for which we are not able to reasonably estimate when cash payments will occur. refer to note9  income taxes and note13  benefit plans in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information related to uncertain tax positions and post-retirement benefits, respectively. we also have the following outstanding short-term debt obligations as of may31, 2016. refer to note7  short-term borrowings and credit lines in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements for further description and interest rates related to the short-term debt obligations listed below.outstanding as of(in millions)may 31, 2016notes payable, due at mutually agreed-upon dates within one

of credit outstanding totaling $157 million. these letters of credit were issued primarily for the purchase of inventory and as guarantees of the companys performance under certain self-insurance and other programs.new accounting pronouncementsrefer to note1  summary of significant accounting policies in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements for recently adopted and recently issued accounting standards. critical accounting policiesour previous discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america. the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities.39table of contentswe believe that the estimates, assumptions and judgments involved in the accounting policies described below have the greatest potential impact on our financial statements, so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies. because of the uncertainty inherent in these matters, actual results could differ from the estimates we use in applying the critical accounting policies. certain of these critical accounting policies affect working capital account balances, including the policies for revenue recognition, the allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable, inventory reserves and contingent payments under endorsement contracts. these policies require that we make estimates in the preparation of our financial statements as of a given date. however, since our business cycle is relatively short, actual results related to these estimates are generally known within the six-month period following the financial statement date. thus, these policies generally affect only the timing of reported amounts across two to three fiscal quarters.within the context of these critical accounting policies, we are not currently aware of any reasonably likely events or circumstances that would result in materially different amounts being reported.revenue recognitionwe record wholesale revenues when title passes and the risks and rewards of ownership have passed to the customer, based on the terms of sale. title passes generally upon shipment or upon receipt by the customer depending on the country of the sale and the agreement with the customer. retail store revenues are recorded at the time of sale and online store revenues are recorded upon delivery to the customer.in some instances, we ship product directly from our supplier to the customer and recognize revenue when the product is delivered to and accepted by the customer. our revenues may fluctuate in cases when our customers delay accepting shipment of product for periods of up to several weeks.in certain countries outside of the united states, precise information regarding the date of receipt by the customer is not readily available. in these cases, we estimate the date of receipt by the customer based upon historical delivery times by geographic location. on the basis of our tests of actual transactions, we have no indication that these estimates have been materially inaccurate historically.as part of our revenue recognition policy, we record estimated sales returns, discounts and miscellaneous claims from customers as reductions to revenues at the time revenues are recorded. our post invoice sales discounts consist of contractual programs with certain customers or discretionary discounts that are expected to be granted to certain customers at a later date. we base our estimates on (1) historical rates of product returns, discounts and claims, (2) specific identification of outstanding claims and outstanding returns not yet received from customers and (3) estimated returns, discounts and claims expected but not yet finalized with our customers. actual returns, discounts and claims in any future period are inherently uncertain and thus may differ from our estimates. if actual or expected future returns, discounts and claims are significantly greater or lower than established reserves, we record a reduction or increase to net revenues in the period in which we make such determination.allowance for uncollectible accounts receivablewe make ongoing estimates relating to the ability to collect our accounts receivable and maintain an allowance for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. in determining the amount of the allowance, we consider our historical level of credit losses and make judgments about the creditworthiness of significant customers based on ongoing credit evaluations. since we cannot predict future changes in the financial stability of our customers, actual future losses from uncollectible accounts may differ from our estimates. if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, resulting in their inability to make payments, a larger allowance might be required. in the event we determine that a smaller or larger allowance is appropriate, we would record a credit or a charge to operating overhead expense in the period in which such a determination is made.inventory reserveswe also make ongoing estimates relating to the net realizable value of inventories based upon our assumptions about future demand and market conditions. if we estimate that the net realizable value of our inventory is less than the cost of the inventory recorded on our books, we record a reserve equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated net realizable value. this reserve is recorded as a charge to cost of sales. if changes in market conditions result in reductions in the estimated net realizable value of our inventory below our previous estimate, we would increase our reserve in the period in which we made such a determination and record a charge to cost of sales.contingent payments under endorsement contractsa significant portion of our demand creation expense relates to payments under endorsement contracts. in general, endorsement payments are expensed uniformly over the term of the contract. however, certain contract elements may be accounted for differently, based upon the facts and circumstances of each individual contract.certain contracts provide for contingent payments to endorsers based upon specific achievements in their sports (e.g., winning a championship). we record demand creation expense for these amounts when the endorser achieves the specific goal.certain contracts provide for variable payments based upon endorsers maintaining a level of performance in their sport over an extended period of time (e.g., maintaining a specified ranking in a sport for a year). when we determine payments are probable, the amounts are recorded in demand creation expense ratably over the contract period based on our best estimate of the endorser's performance. in these instances, to the extent that actual payments to the endorser differ from our estimate due to changes in the endorsers performance, increased or decreased demand creation expense may be recorded in a future period.certain contracts provide for royalty payments to endorsers based upon a predetermined percent of sales of particular products. we expense these payments in cost of sales as the related sales occur. in certain contracts, we offer minimum guaranteed royalty payments. for contracts for which we estimate we will not meet the minimum guaranteed amount of royalty fees through sales of product, we record the amount of the guaranteed payment in excess of that earned through sales of product in demand creation expense uniformly over the contract term.40table of contentsproperty, plant and equipment and definite-lived assetsproperty, plant and equipment, including buildings, equipment and computer hardware and software are recorded at cost (including, in some cases, the cost of internal labor) and are depreciated over the estimated useful life. changes in circumstances (such as technological advances or changes to our business operations) can result in differences between the actual and estimated useful lives. in those cases where we determine that the useful life of a long-lived asset should be shortened, we increase depreciation expense over the remaining useful life to depreciate the assets net book value to its salvage value.we review the carrying value of long-lived assets or asset groups to be used in operations whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets might not be recoverable. factors that would necessitate an impairment assessment include a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used, a significant adverse change in legal factors or the business climate that could affect the value of the asset or a significant decline in the observable market value of an asset, among others. if such facts indicate a potential impairment, we would assess the recoverability of an asset group by determining if the carrying value of the asset group exceeds the sum of the projected undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the assets over the remaining economic life of the primary asset in the asset group. if the recoverability test indicates that the carrying value of the asset group is not recoverable, we will estimate the fair value of the asset group using appropriate valuation methodologies that would typically include an estimate of discounted cash flows. any impairment would be measured as the difference between the asset groups carrying amount and its estimated fair value.goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets we perform annual impairment tests on goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year or when events occur or circumstances change that would, more likely than not, reduce the fair value of a reporting unit or an intangible asset with an indefinite life below its carrying value. events or changes in circumstances that may trigger interim impairment reviews include significant changes in business climate, operating results, planned investments in the reporting unit, planned divestitures or an expectation that the carrying amount may not be recoverable, among other factors. we may first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. if, after assessing the totality of events and circumstances, we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount, the two-step impairment test is unnecessary. the two-step impairment test requires us to estimate the fair value of our reporting units. if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the goodwill of that reporting unit is potentially impaired and we proceed to step two of the impairment analysis. in step two of the analysis, we measure and record an impairment loss equal to the excess of the carrying value of the reporting unit's goodwill over its implied fair value, if any.we generally base our measurement of the fair value of a reporting unit on a blended analysis of the present value of future discounted cash flows and the market valuation approach. the discounted cash flows model indicates the fair value of the reporting unit based on the present value of the cash flows that we expect the reporting unit to generate in the future. our significant estimates in the discounted cash flows model include: our weighted average cost of capital; long-term rate of growth and profitability of the reporting unit's business; and working capital effects. the market valuation approach indicates the fair value of the business based on a comparison of the reporting unit to comparable publicly traded companies in similar lines of business. significant estimates in the market valuation approach model include identifying similar companies with comparable business factors such as size, growth, profitability, risk and return on investment, and assessing comparable revenue and operating income multiples in estimating the fair value of the reporting unit. indefinite-lived intangible assets primarily consist of acquired trade names and trademarks. we may first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that an indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired. if, after assessing the totality of events and circumstances, we determine that it is more likely than not that the indefinite-lived intangible asset is not impaired, no quantitative fair value measurement is necessary. if a quantitative fair value measurement calculation is required for these intangible assets, we utilize the relief-from-royalty method. this method assumes that trade names and trademarks have value to the extent that their owner is relieved of the obligation to pay royalties for the benefits received from them. this method requires us to estimate the future revenue for the related brands, the appropriate royalty rate and the weighted average cost of capital. fair value measurementsfor financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis, fair value is the price we would receive to sell an asset or pay to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction with a market participant at the measurement date. in general, and where applicable, we use quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities to determine the fair values of our financial instruments.this pricing methodology applies to our level 1 investments, including u.s. treasury securities.in the absence of active markets for identical assets or liabilities, such measurements involve developing assumptions based on market observable data, including quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets and quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active. this pricing methodology applies to our level 2 investments such as time deposits, commercial paper and bonds, u.s. agency securities and money market funds.level 3 investments are valued using internally developed models with unobservable inputs.assets and liabilities measured using unobservable inputs are an immaterial portion of our portfolio.a majority of our available-for-sale securities are priced by pricing vendors and are generally level 1 or level 2 investments as these vendors either provide a quoted market price in an active market or use observable inputs without applying significant adjustments in their pricing.observable inputs include broker quotes, interest rates and yield curves observable at commonly quoted intervals, volatilities and credit risks. our fair value processes include controls that are designed to ensure appropriate fair values are recorded.these controls include a comparison to another independent pricing vendor.41table of contentshedge accounting for derivativeswe use derivative contracts to hedge certain anticipated foreign currency and interest rate transactions as well as certain non-functional currency monetary assets and liabilities. when the specific criteria to qualify for hedge accounting has been met, changes in the fair value of contracts hedging probable forecasted future cash flows are recorded in other comprehensive income, rather than net income, until the underlying hedged transaction affects net income. in most cases, this results in gains and losses on hedge derivatives being released from other comprehensive income into net income sometime after the maturity of the derivative. one of the criteria for this accounting treatment is that the notional value of these derivative contracts should not be in excess of specifically identified anticipated transactions. by their very nature, our estimates of anticipated transactions may fluctuate over time and may ultimately vary from actual transactions. when anticipated transaction estimates or actual transaction amounts decline below hedged levels, or if it is no longer probable that a forecasted transaction will occur by the end of the originally specified time period or within an additional two-month period of time thereafter, we are required to reclassify the cumulative change in fair value of the over-hedged portion of the related hedge contract from other comprehensive income to other (income) expense, net during the quarter in which the decrease occurs.we have used in the past, and may use in the future, forward contracts or options to hedge our investment in the net assets of certain international subsidiaries to offset foreign currency translation related to our net investment in those subsidiaries. the change in fair value of the forward contracts or options hedging our net investments is reported in the cumulative translation adjustment component of accumulated other comprehensive income within total shareholders equity, to the extent effective, to offset the foreign currency translation adjustments on those investments. as the value of our underlying net investments in wholly-owned international subsidiaries is known at the time a hedge is placed, the designated hedge is matched to the portion of our net investment at risk. accordingly, the variability involved in net investment hedges is substantially less than that of other types of hedge transactions and we do not expect any material ineffectiveness. we consider, on a quarterly basis, the need to redesignate existing hedge relationships based on changes in the underlying net investment. should the level of our net investment decrease below hedged levels, the cumulative change in fair value of the over-hedged portion of the related hedge contract would be reported as other (income) expense, net during the period in which changes occur.stock-based compensationwe account for stock-based compensation by estimating the fair value of stock-based compensation on the date of grant using the black-scholes option pricing model. the black-scholes option pricing model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions including volatility. expected volatility is estimated based on implied volatility in market traded options on our common stock with a term greater than one year, along with other factors. our decision to use implied volatility was based on the availability of actively traded options on our common stock and our assessment that implied volatility is more representative of future stock price trends than historical volatility. if factors change and we use different assumptions for estimating stock-based compensation expense in future periods, stock-based compensation expense may differ materially in the future from that recorded in the current period.income taxeswe record valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets, when necessary. realization of deferred tax assets (such as net operating loss carry-forwards) is dependent on future taxable earnings and is therefore uncertain. at least quarterly, we assess the likelihood that our deferred tax asset balance will be recovered from future taxable income. to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely, we establish a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax asset, which increases our income tax expense in the period when such determination is made.in addition, we have not recorded u.s. income tax expense for foreign earnings that we have determined to be indefinitely reinvested outside the united states, thus reducing our overall income tax expense. the amount of earnings designated as indefinitely reinvested offshore is based upon the actual deployment of such earnings in our offshore assets and our expectations of the future cash needs of our u.s. and foreign entities. income tax considerations are also a factor in determining the amount of foreign earnings to be indefinitely reinvested offshore.we carefully review all factors that drive the ultimate disposition of foreign earnings determined to be reinvested offshore and apply stringent standards to overcome the presumption of repatriation. despite this approach, because the determination involves our future plans and expectations of future events, the possibility exists that amounts declared as indefinitely reinvested offshore may ultimately be repatriated. for instance, the actual cash needs of our u.s. entities may exceed our current expectations, or the actual cash needs of our foreign entities may be less than our current expectations. this would result in additional income tax expense in the year we determined that amounts were no longer indefinitely reinvested offshore. conversely, our approach may also result in a determination that accumulated foreign earnings (for which u.s. income taxes have been provided) will be indefinitely reinvested offshore. in this case, our income tax expense would be reduced in the year of such determination.on an interim basis, we estimate what our effective tax rate will be for the full fiscal year. this estimated annual effective tax rate is then applied to the year-to-date income before income taxes excluding infrequently occurring or unusual items, to determine the year-to-date income tax expense. the income tax effects of infrequent or unusual items are recognized in the interim period in which they occur. as the fiscal year progresses, we continually refine our estimate based upon actual events and earnings by jurisdiction during the year. this continual estimation process periodically results in a change to our expected effective tax rate for the fiscal year. when this occurs, we adjust the income tax provision during the quarter in which the change in estimate occurs.on a quarterly basis, we evaluate the probability that a tax position will be effectively sustained and the appropriateness of the amount recognized for uncertain tax positions based on factors including changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, settled audit issues and new audit activity. changes in our assessment may result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision in the period our assessment changes. we recognize interest and penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense.42table of contentsother contingenciesin the ordinary course of business, we are involved in legal proceedings regarding contractual and employment relationships, product liability claims, trademark rights and a variety of other matters. we record contingent liabilities resulting from claims against us, including related legal costs, when a loss is assessed to be probable and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable. assessing probability of loss and estimating probable losses requires analysis of multiple factors, including in some cases judgments about the potential actions of third-party claimants and courts. recorded contingent liabilities are based on the best information available and actual losses in any future period are inherently uncertain. if future adjustments to estimated probable future losses or actual losses exceed our recorded liability for such claims, we would record additional charges during the period in which the actual loss or change in estimate occurred. in addition to contingent liabilities recorded for probable losses, we disclose contingent liabilities when there is a reasonable possibility that the ultimate loss will materially exceed the recorded liability. while we cannot predict the outcome of pending legal matters with certainty, we do not believe any currently identified claim, proceeding or litigation, either individually or in aggregate, will have a material impact on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows.43table of contentsitem7a. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market riskin the normal course of business and consistent with established policies and procedures, we employ a variety of financial instruments to manage exposure to fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies and interest rates. it is our policy to utilize these financial instruments only where necessary to finance our business and manage such exposures; we do not enter into these transactions for trading or speculative purposes.we are exposed to foreign currency fluctuations, primarily as a result of our international sales, product sourcing and funding activities. our foreign exchange risk management program is intended to lessen both the positive and negative effects of currency fluctuations on our consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows. we use forward and option contracts to hedge certain anticipated but not yet firmly committed transactions as well as certain firm commitments and the related receivables and payables, including third-party and intercompany transactions. we have, in the past, and may in the future, also use forward or options contracts to hedge our investment in the net assets of certain international subsidiaries to offset foreign currency translation adjustments related to our net investment in those subsidiaries. where exposures are hedged, our program has the effect of delaying the impact of exchange rate movements on our consolidated financial statements.the timing for hedging exposures, as well as the type and duration of the hedge instruments employed, are guided by our hedging policies and determined based upon the nature of the exposure and prevailing market conditions. typically, the company may enter into hedge contracts starting up to 12 to 24 months in advance of the forecasted transaction and may place incremental hedges up to 100% of the exposure by the time the forecasted transaction occurs. the majority of derivatives outstanding as of may31, 2016 are designated as foreign currency cash flow hedges, primarily for euro/u.s. dollar, british pound/euro and japanese yen/u.s. dollar currency pairs. see section foreign currency exposures and hedging practices under item7 for additional detail.our earnings are also exposed to movements in short- and long-term market interest rates. our objective in managing this interest rate exposure is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to reduce overall borrowing costs. to achieve these objectives, we maintain a mix of commercial paper, bank loans, fixed-rate debt of varying maturities and have entered into receive-fixed, pay-variable interest rate swaps for a portion of our fixed-rate debt, as well as pay-fixed, receive-variable forward-starting interest rate swaps for cash outflows of interest payments on future debt.market risk measurementwe monitor foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk and related derivatives using a variety of techniques including a review of market value, sensitivity analysis and value-at-risk (var). our market-sensitive derivative and other financial instruments are foreign currency forward contracts, foreign currency option contracts, interest rate swaps, intercompany loans denominated in non-functional currencies, fixed interest rate u.s.dollar denominated debt and fixed interest rate japanese yen denominated debt.we use var to monitor the foreign exchange risk of our foreign currency forward and foreign currency option derivative instruments only. the var determines the maximum potential one-day loss in the fair value of these foreign exchange rate-sensitive financial instruments. the var model estimates assume normal market conditions and a 95% confidence level. there are various modeling techniques that can be used in the var computation. our computations are based on interrelationships between currencies and interest rates (avariance/co-variance technique). these interrelationships are a function of foreign exchange currency market changes and interest rate changes over the preceding one year period. the value of foreign currency options does not change on a one-to-one basis with changes in the underlying currency rate. we adjust the potential loss in option value for the estimated sensitivity (the delta and gamma) to changes in the underlying currency rate. this calculation reflects the impact of foreign currency rate fluctuations on the derivative instruments only and does not include the impact of such rate fluctuations on non-functional currency transactions (such as anticipated transactions, firm commitments, cash balances and accounts and loans receivable and payable), including those which are hedged by these instruments.the var model is a risk analysis tool and does not purport to represent actual losses in fair value that we will incur nor does it consider the potential effect of favorable changes in market rates. it also does not represent the full extent of the possible loss that may occur. actual future gains and losses will differ from those estimated because of changes or differences in market rates and interrelationships, hedging instruments and hedge percentages, timing and other factors.the estimated maximum one-day loss in fair value on our foreign currency sensitive derivative financial instruments, derived using the var model, was $109 million and $117 million at may31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. the var decreased year-over-year as a result of a decrease in the total notional value of our foreign currency derivative portfolio at may 31, 2016. such a hypothetical loss in the fair value of our derivatives would be offset by increases in the value of the underlying transactions being hedged. the average monthly change in the fair values of foreign currency forward and foreign currency option derivative instruments was $209 million and $205 million during fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015, respectively.the instruments not included in the var are intercompany loans denominated in non-functional currencies, fixed interest rate japanese yen denominated debt, fixed interest rate u.s.dollar denominated debt and interest rate swaps. intercompany loans and related interest amounts are eliminated in consolidation. furthermore, our non-functional currency intercompany loans are substantially hedged against foreign exchange risk through the use of forward contracts, which are included in the var calculation above. therefore, we consider the interest rate and foreign currency market risks associated with our non-functional currency intercompany loans to be immaterial to our consolidated financial position, results from operations and cash flows.during the year ended may 31, 2016, we entered into a series of forward-starting interest rate swap agreements. a forward-starting interest rate swap is an agreement that effectively hedges the variability in future benchmark interest payments attributable to changes in interest rates on the forecasted issuance of fixed-rate debt. we entered into these forward-starting interest rate swaps in order to lock in fixed interest rates on our forecasted issuance of debt. these instruments were designated as cash flow hedges of the variability in the expected cash outflows of interest payments on future debt due to changes in benchmark interest rates.details of third-party debt and interest rate swaps are provided in the table below. the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates. 44table of contentsexpected maturity dateyear ending

market and sell similar products. operating results of the converse brand are reported on a stand-alone basis.basis of consolidationthe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of nike, inc. and its subsidiaries (thecompany). all significant intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated.on november 19, 2015, the company announced a two-for-one split of both nike class a and class b common stock. the stock split was in the form of a 100 percent stock dividend payable on december 23, 2015 to shareholders of record at the close of business on december 9, 2015. common stock began trading at the split-adjusted price on december 24, 2015. all share and per share amounts presented reflect the stock split.reclassificationscertain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to fiscal 2016 presentation.revenue recognitionwholesale revenues are recognized when title and the risks and rewards of ownership have passed to the customer, based on the terms of sale. this occurs upon shipment or upon receipt by the customer depending on the country of the sale and the agreement with the customer. retail store revenues are recorded at the time of sale and online store revenues are recorded upon delivery to the customer. provisions for post-invoice sales discounts, returns and miscellaneous claims from customers are estimated and recorded as a reduction to revenue at the time of sale. post-invoice sales discounts consist of contractual programs with certain customers or discretionary discounts that are expected to be granted to certain customers at a later date.estimates of discretionary discounts, returns and claims are based on (1) historical rates, (2) specific identification of outstanding claims and outstanding returns not yet received from customers and (3) estimated discounts, returns and claims expected, but not yet finalized with customers.as of may31, 2016 and 2015, the companys reserve balances for post-invoice sales discounts, returns and miscellaneous claims were $789 million and $724 million, respectively.cost of salescost of sales consists primarily of inventory costs, as well as warehousing costs (including the cost of warehouse labor), third-party royalties, certain foreign currency hedge gains and losses and research, design and development costs. outbound shipping and handling costs are expensed as incurred and included in cost of sales.operating overhead expenseoperating overhead expense consists primarily of payroll and benefit related costs, rent, depreciation and amortization, professional services and meetings and travel.demand creation expensedemand creation expense consists of advertising and promotion costs, including costs of endorsement contracts, television, digital and print advertising, brand events and retail brand presentation. advertising production costs are expensed the first time an advertisement is run. advertising communication costs are expensed when the advertisement appears. costs related to brand events are expensed when the event occurs. costs related to retail brand presentation are expensed when the presentation is completed and delivered.a significant amount of the companys promotional expenses result from payments under endorsement contracts. accounting for endorsement payments is based upon specific contract provisions. generally, endorsement payments are expensed on a straight-line basis over the term of the contract after giving recognition to periodic performance compliance provisions of the contracts. prepayments made under contracts are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets or deferred income taxes and other assets depending on the period to which the prepayment applies.certain contracts provide for contingent payments to endorsers based upon specific achievements in their sports (e.g., winning a championship). the company records demand creation expense for these amounts when the endorser achieves the specific goal.certain contracts provide for variable payments based upon endorsers maintaining a level of performance in their sport over an extended period of time (e.g., maintaining a specified ranking in a sport for a year). when the company determines payments are probable, the amounts are reported in demand creation expense ratably over the contract period based on our best estimate of the endorser's performance. in these instances, to the extent that actual payments to the endorser differ from the company's estimate due to changes in the endorsers performance, increased or decreased demand creation expense may be recorded in a future period.54table of contentscertain contracts provide for royalty payments to endorsers based upon a predetermined percent of sales of particular products. the company expenses these payments in cost of sales as the related sales occur. in certain contracts, the company offers minimum guaranteed royalty payments. for contracts for which the company estimates it will not meet the minimum guaranteed amount of royalty fees through sales of product, the company records the amount of the guaranteed payment in excess of that earned through sales of product in demand creation expense uniformly over the contract term.through cooperative advertising programs, the company reimburses retail customers for certain costs of advertising the companys products. the company records these costs in demand creation expense at the point in time when it is obligated to its customers for the costs. this obligation may arise prior to the related advertisement being run.total advertising and promotion expenses were $3,278 million, $3,213 million and $3,031 million for the years ended may31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. prepaid advertising and promotion expenses totaled $540 million and $455 million at may31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and were recorded in prepaid expenses and other current assets and deferred income taxes and other assets depending on the period to which the prepayment applies.cash and equivalentscash and equivalents represent cash and short-term, highly liquid investments, including commercial paper, u.s. treasury, u.s. agency, money market funds, time deposits and corporate debt securities with maturities of 90 days or less at the date of purchase.short-term investmentsshort-term investments consist of highly liquid investments, including commercial paper, u.s. treasury, u.s. agency, time deposits and corporate debt securities, with maturities over 90 days at the date of purchase. debt securities that the company has the ability and positive intent to hold to maturity are carried at amortized cost. at may31, 2016 and 2015, the company did not hold any short-term investments that were classified as trading or held-to-maturity.at may31, 2016 and 2015, short-term investments consisted of available-for-sale securities. available-for-sale securities are recorded at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported, net of tax, in accumulated other comprehensive income, unless unrealized losses are determined to be other than temporary. realized gains and losses on the sale of securities are determined by specific identification. the company considers all available-for-sale securities, including those with maturity dates beyond 12 months, as available to support current operational liquidity needs and therefore classifies all securities with maturity dates beyond 90 days at the date of purchase as current assets within short-term investments on the consolidated balance sheets.refer to note6  fair value measurements for more information on the companys short-term investments.allowance for uncollectible accounts receivableaccounts receivable, net consist primarily of amounts receivable from customers. the company makes ongoing estimates relating to the collectability of its accounts receivable and maintains an allowance for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments. in determining the amount of the allowance, the company considers historical levels of credit losses and makes judgments about the creditworthiness of significant customers based on ongoing credit evaluations. accounts receivable with anticipated collection dates greater than 12 months from the balance sheet date and related allowances are considered non-current and recorded in deferred income taxes and other assets. the allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable was $43 million and $78 million at may31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, of which $17 million and $24 million, respectively, was classified as long-term and recorded in deferred income taxes and other assets.inventory valuationinventories are stated at lower of cost or market and valued on either an average or specific identification cost basis. for inventories in transit that represent direct shipments to customers, the related inventory and cost of sales are recognized on a specific identification basis. inventory costs primarily consist of product cost from the company's suppliers, as well as inbound freight, import duties, taxes, insurance and logistics and other handling fees.property, plant and equipment and depreciationproperty, plant and equipment are recorded at cost. depreciation is determined on a straight-line basis for buildings and leasehold improvements over 2 to 40 years and for machinery and equipment over 2 to 15 years.depreciation and amortization of assets used in manufacturing, warehousing and product distribution are recorded in cost of sales. depreciation and amortization of other assets are recorded in operating overhead expense.software development costsinternal use software: expenditures for major software purchases and software developed for internal use are capitalized and amortized over a 2 to 10 year period on a straight-line basis. the companys policy provides for the capitalization of external direct costs of materials and services associated with developing or obtaining internal use computer software. in addition, the company also capitalizes certain payroll and payroll-related costs for employees who are directly associated with internal use computer software projects. the amount of capitalizable payroll costs with respect to these employees is limited to the time directly spent on such projects. costs associated with preliminary project stage activities, training, maintenance and all other post-implementation stage activities are expensed as incurred.computer software to be sold, leased or otherwise marketed: development costs of computer software to be sold, leased or otherwise marketed as an integral part of a product are subject to capitalization beginning when a products technological feasibility has been established and ending when a product is available for general release to customers. in most instances, the companys products are released soon after technological feasibility has been established. therefore, software development costs incurred subsequent to achievement of technological feasibility are usually not significant, and generally most software development costs have been expensed as incurred.55table of contentsimpairment of long-lived assetsthe company reviews the carrying value of long-lived assets or asset groups to be used in operations whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets might not be recoverable. factors that would necessitate an impairment assessment include a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used, a significant adverse change in legal factors or the business climate that could affect the value of the asset or a significant decline in the observable market value of an asset, among others. if such facts indicate a potential impairment, the company would assess the recoverability of an asset group by determining if the carrying value of the asset group exceeds the sum of the projected undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the assets over the remaining economic life of the primary asset in the asset group. if the recoverability test indicates that the carrying value of the asset group is not recoverable, the company will estimate the fair value of the asset group using appropriate valuation methodologies, which would typically include an estimate of discounted cash flows. any impairment would be measured as the difference between the asset groups carrying amount and its estimated fair value.goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assetsthe company performs annual impairment tests on goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year or when events occur or circumstances change that would, more likely than not, reduce the fair value of a reporting unit or an intangible asset with an indefinite life below its carrying value. events or changes in circumstances that may trigger interim impairment reviews include significant changes in business climate, operating results, planned investments in the reporting unit, planned divestitures or an expectation that the carrying amount may not be recoverable, among other factors. the company may first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. if, after assessing the totality of events and circumstances, the company determines that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount, the two-step impairment test is unnecessary. the two-step impairment test first requires the company to estimate the fair value of its reporting units. if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the goodwill of that reporting unit is potentially impaired and the company proceeds to step two of the impairment analysis. in step two of the analysis, the company measures and records an impairment loss equal to the excess of the carrying value of the reporting unit's goodwill over its implied fair value, if any.the company generally bases its measurement of the fair value of a reporting unit on a blended analysis of the present value of future discounted cash flows and the market valuation approach. the discounted cash flows model indicates the fair value of the reporting unit based on the present value of the cash flows that the company expects the reporting unit to generate in the future. the company's significant estimates in the discounted cash flows model include: its weighted average cost of capital; long-term rate of growth and profitability of the reporting unit's business; and working capital effects. the market valuation approach indicates the fair value of the business based on a comparison of the reporting unit to comparable publicly traded companies in similar lines of business. significant estimates in the market valuation approach model include identifying similar companies with comparable business factors such as size, growth, profitability, risk and return on investment and assessing comparable revenue and operating income multiples in estimating the fair value of the reporting unit.indefinite-lived intangible assets primarily consist of acquired trade names and trademarks. the company may first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that an indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired. if, after assessing the totality of events and circumstances, the company determines that it is more likely than not that the indefinite-lived intangible asset is not impaired, no quantitative fair value measurement is necessary. if a quantitative fair value measurement calculation is required for these intangible assets, the company utilizes the relief-from-royalty method. this method assumes that trade names and trademarks have value to the extent that their owner is relieved of the obligation to pay royalties for the benefits received from them. this method requires the company to estimate the future revenue for the related brands, the appropriate royalty rate and the weighted average cost of capital.operating leasesthe company leases retail store space, certain distribution and warehouse facilities, office space and other non-real estate assets under operating leases. operating lease agreements may contain rent escalation clauses, renewal options, rent holidays or certain landlord incentives, including tenant improvement allowances. rent expense for non-cancelable operating leases with scheduled rent increases or landlord incentives are recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term, beginning with the effective lease commencement date, which is generally the date in which the company takes possession of or controls the physical use of the property. certain leases also provide for contingent rent, which is determined as a percent of sales in excess of specified levels. a contingent rent liability is recognized together with the corresponding rent expense when specified levels have been achieved or when the company determines that achieving the specified levels during the period is probable.fair value measurementsthe company measures certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value on a recurring basis, including derivatives and available-for-sale securities. fair value is the price the company would receive to sell an asset or pay to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction with a market participant at the measurement date. the company uses a three-level hierarchy established by the financial accounting standards board ("fasb") that prioritizes fair value measurements based on the types of inputs used for the various valuation techniques (market approach, income approach and cost approach).the levels of hierarchy are described below:level 1:quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.level 2:inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly; these include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets and quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active.level 3:unobservable inputs for which there is little or no market data available, which require the reporting entity to develop its own assumptions.the companys assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the asset or liability.financial assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the most conservative level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.56table of contentspricing vendors are utilized for certain level 1 and level 2 investments. these vendors either provide a quoted market price in an active market or use observable inputs without applying significant adjustments in their pricing. observable inputs include broker quotes, interest rates and yield curves observable at commonly quoted intervals, volatilities and credit risks. the fair value of derivative contracts is determined using observable market inputs such as the daily market foreign currency rates, forward pricing curves, currency volatilities, currency correlations and interest rates and considers nonperformance risk of the company and that of its counterparties. the companys fair value processes include controls that are designed to ensure appropriate fair values are recorded. these controls include a comparison of fair values to another independent pricing vendor. refer to note6  fair value measurements for additional information.foreign currency translation and foreign currency transactionsadjustments resulting from translating foreign functional currency financial statements into u.s. dollars are included in the foreign currency translation adjustment, a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in total shareholders equity.the companys global subsidiaries have various assets and liabilities, primarily receivables and payables, which are denominated in currencies other than their functional currency. these balance sheet items are subject to re-measurement, the impact of which is recorded in other (income) expense, net, within the consolidated statements of income.accounting for derivatives and hedging activitiesthe company uses derivative financial instruments to reduce its exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. all derivatives are recorded at fair value on the consolidated balance sheets and changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments are either recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income (a component of total shareholders equity), long-term debt or net income depending on the nature of the underlying exposure, whether the derivative is formally designated as a hedge and, if designated, the extent to which the hedge is effective. the company classifies the cash flows at settlement from derivatives in the same category as the cash flows from the related hedged items. for undesignated hedges and designated cash flow hedges, this is primarily within the cash provided by operations component of the consolidated statements of cash flows. for designated net investment hedges, this is within the cash used by investing activities component of the consolidated statements of cash flows. for the companys fair value hedges, which are interest rate swaps used to mitigate the change in fair value of its fixed-rate debt attributable to changes in interest rates, the related cash flows from periodic interest payments are reflected within the cash provided by operations component of the consolidated statements of cash flows. refer to note16  risk management and derivatives for more information on the companys risk management program and derivatives.stock-based compensationthe company estimates the fair value of options and stock appreciation rights granted under the nike, inc. stock incentive plan and employees purchase rights under the employee stock purchase plans (espps) using the black-scholes option pricing model. the company recognizes this fair value, net of estimated forfeitures, as operating overhead expense in the consolidated statements of income over the vesting period using the straight-line method.refer to note11  common stock and stock-based compensation for more information on the companys stock-based compensation programs.income taxesthe company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method. this approach requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities. the company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount management believes is more likely than not to be realized. united states income taxes are provided currently on financial statement earnings of non-u.s. subsidiaries that are expected to be repatriated. the company determines annually the amount of undistributed non-u.s. earnings to invest indefinitely in its non-u.s. operations.the company recognizes a tax benefit from uncertain tax positions in the financial statements only when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination by relevant tax authorities. the company recognizes interest and penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense.refer to note9  income taxes for further discussion.earnings per sharebasic earnings per common share is calculated by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the year. diluted earnings per common share is calculated by adjusting weighted average outstanding shares, assuming conversion of all potentially dilutive stock options and awards.refer to note 12  earnings per share for further discussion.management estimatesthe preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates, including estimates relating to assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. actual results could differ from these estimates.57table of contentsrecently adopted accounting standardsin november 2015, the fasb issued asu no. 2015-17,income taxes (topic 740): balance sheet classification of deferred taxes to simplify the presentation of deferred taxes in the statement of financial position. the updated guidance requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be classified as non-current in a classified balance sheet. the company elected to early adopt asu 2015-17 on a retrospective basis in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. the adoption of this standard reduced total current assets by $389 million, increased deferred income taxes and other assets by $386 million and reduced total current liabilities and deferred income taxes and other liabilities by $2 million and $1 million, respectively, on the consolidated balance sheet as of may 31, 2015.recently issued accounting standardsin may 2014, the financial accounting standards board ("fasb") issued an accounting standards update that replaces existing revenue recognition guidance. the updated guidance requires companies to recognize revenue in a way that depicts the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. in addition, the new standard requires that reporting companies disclose the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. based on the fasb's decision in july 2015 to defer the effective date and to allow more flexibility with implementation, the new standard will be effective for the company beginning june 1, 2018, with early application permitted. the new standard is required to be applied retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented or retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying it recognized at the date of initial application. the company has not yet selected a transition method and is currently evaluating the effect the guidance will have on the consolidated financial statements.in january 2016, the fasb issued asu no. 2016-01,financial instruments - overall (subtopic 825-10): recognition and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities. the updated guidance enhances the reporting model for financial instruments, which includes amendments to address aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure.the update to the standard is effective for the company beginning june 1, 2018. the company does not expect the adoption to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.in february 2016, the fasb issued asu no. 2016-02, leases (topic 842) that replaces existing lease guidance. the new standard is intended to provide enhanced transparency and comparability by requiring lessees to record right-of-use assets and corresponding lease liabilities on the balance sheet. the new guidance will continue to classify leases as either finance or operating, with classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition in the statement of income. the standard is effective for the company beginning june 1, 2019, with early application permitted. the new standard is required to be applied with a modified retrospective approach to each prior reporting period presented with optional practical expedients. the company is currently evaluating the effect the guidance will have on the consolidated financial statements.in march 2016, the fasb issued asu no. 2016-09, compensation-stock compensation (topic 718): improvements to employee share-based payment accounting. the updated guidance changes how companies account for certain aspects of share-based payment awards to employees, including the accounting for income taxes, forfeitures and statutory tax withholding requirements, as well as classification in the statement of cash flows. the update to the standard is effective for the company beginning june 1, 2017, with early application permitted. the company is currently evaluating the effect the guidance will have on the consolidated financial statements.note2  inventoriesinventory balances of $4,838

million was allocated to the land and buildings acquired; no other tangible or intangible assets or liabilities resulted from the purchase. the bonds mature in 2017 and 2018 and the company does not have the ability to re-negotiate the terms of the debt agreements and would incur significant financial penalties if the notes were paid-off prior to maturity. during the year ended may31, 2016, the

fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended may31, 2014, the company reached a resolution with the irs on a u.s. unilateral advanced pricing agreement that covers intercompany transfer pricing for fiscal years 2011 through 2020. as a result, the company recorded a gross increase in unrecognized tax benefits related to prior period tax positions, a gross decrease in unrecognized tax benefits related to prior period tax positions and a settlement. the net impact of these items resulted in a decrease to unrecognized tax benefits.as of may31, 2016, total gross unrecognized tax benefits, excluding related interest and penalties, were $506 million, $290 million of which would affect the company's effective tax rate if recognized in future periods.the company recognizes interest and penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense. the liability for payment of interest and penalties increased by $45 million during the year ended may31, 2016, decreased by $3 million during the year ended may31, 2015 and increased by $55 million during the year ended may31, 2014. as of may31, 2016 and 2015, accrued interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions were $209 million and $164 million, respectively (excluding federal benefit).the company incurs tax liabilities primarily in the united states, china and the netherlands, as well as various state and other foreign jurisdictions. the company is currently under audit by the u.s. internal revenue service (irs) for fiscal years 2013 through 2015. the company has closed all u.s. federal income tax matters through fiscal 2012, with the exception of the validation of foreign tax credits utilized. during the year ended may 31, 2016, the company received from the irs a statutory notice of deficiency for fiscal 2012, proposing an increase in tax of $223 million, subject to interest, related to the foreign tax credit matter. the company intends to contest this deficiency notice. as previously disclosed, the company received a statutory notice of deficiency for fiscal 2011, proposing an increase in tax of $31 million, subject to interest, related to the foreign tax credit matter. this notice also reported a decrease in foreign tax credit carryovers for fiscal 2010 and 2011. the company has contested this deficiency notice by filing a petition with the u.s tax court in april 2015. the company does not expect the outcome of this matter to have a material impact on the financial statements. no payments on the assessment would be required until the dispute is definitively resolved. based on the information currently available, the company does not anticipate a significant increase or decrease to its unrecognized tax benefits for this matter within the next 12 months.64table of contentsthe companys major foreign jurisdictions, china and the netherlands, have concluded substantially all income tax matters through calendar 2005 and fiscal 2010, respectively. although the timing of resolution of audits is not certain, the company evaluates all domestic and foreign audit issues in the aggregate, along with the expiration of applicable statutes of limitations, and estimates that it is reasonably possible the total gross unrecognized tax benefits could decrease by up to $92 million within the next 12 months.the company provides for u.s. income taxes on the undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries unless they are considered indefinitely reinvested outside the united states. at may31, 2016, the indefinitely reinvested earnings in foreign subsidiaries upon which united states income taxes have not been provided were approximately $10.7 billion. if these undistributed earnings were repatriated to the united states or if the shares of the relevant foreign subsidiaries were sold or otherwise transferred, they would generate foreign tax credits that would reduce the federal tax liability associated with the foreign dividend or the otherwise taxable transaction. assuming a full utilization of the foreign tax credits, the potential net deferred tax liability associated with these temporary differences of undistributed earnings would be approximately $3.6 billion at may31, 2016.a portion of the company's foreign operations are benefiting from a tax holiday, which is set to expire in 2021. this tax holiday may be extended when certain conditions are met or may be terminated early if certain conditions are not met. the impact of this tax holiday decreased foreign taxes by $173 million, $174 million and $138 million for the fiscal years ended may31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. the benefit of the tax holiday on diluted earnings per common share was $0.10, $0.10 and $0.08 for the fiscal years ended may31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.deferred tax assets at may31, 2016 and 2015 were reduced by a valuation allowance relating to tax benefits of certain subsidiaries with operating losses. there was a $43 million net increase in the valuation allowancefor the year ended may31, 2016, compared to no net change and a net increase of $4 million for the years ended may31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.the company has

relating to the enforceability of intellectual property rights, coverage for legal issues that arise and other items where the company is acting as the guarantor. currently, the company has several such agreements in place. however, based on the companys historical experience and the estimated probability of future loss, the company has determined that the fair value of such indemnification is not material to the companys financial position or results of operations.in the ordinary course of its business, the company is involved in various legal proceedings involving contractual and employment relationships, product liability claims, trademark rights and a variety of other matters. while the company cannot predict the outcome of its pending legal matters with certainty, the company does not believe any currently identified claim, proceeding or litigation, either individually or in aggregate, will have a material impact on the companys results of operations, financial position or cash flows.note16  risk management and derivativesthe company is exposed to global market risks, including the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates, and uses derivatives to manage financial exposures that occur in the normal course of business. the company does not hold or issue derivatives for trading or speculative purposes.the company may elect to designate certain derivatives as hedging instruments under the accounting standards for derivatives and hedging. the company formally documents all relationships between designated hedging instruments and hedged items as well as its risk management objectives and strategies for undertaking hedge transactions. this process includes linking all derivatives designated as hedges to either recognized assets or liabilities or forecasted transactions.the majority of derivatives outstanding as of may31, 2016 are designated as foreign currency cash flow hedges, primarily for euro/u.s. dollar, british pound/euro and japanese yen/u.s. dollar currency pairs. all derivatives are recognized on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value and classified based on the instruments maturity date.the

income and the consolidated statements of shareholders equity for additional information on changes in accumulated other comprehensive income for the years ended may31, 2016, 2015 and 2014.cash flow hedgesthe purpose of the company's foreign exchange risk management program is to lessen both the positive and negative effects of currency fluctuations on the company's consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows. foreign currency exposures that the company may elect to hedge in this manner include product cost exposures, non-functional currency denominated external and intercompany revenues, selling and administrative expenses, investments in u.s.dollar-denominated available-for-sale debt securities and certain other intercompany transactions.product cost exposures are primarily generated through non-functional currency denominated product purchases and the foreign currency adjustment program described below. nike entities primarily purchase products in two ways: (1) certain nike entities purchase product from the nike trading company (ntc), a wholly owned sourcing hub that buys nike branded products from third party factories, predominantly in u.s. dollars. the ntc, whose functional currency is the u.s.dollar, then sells the product to nike entities in their respective functional currencies. when the ntc sells to a nike entity with a different functional currency, the result is a foreign currency exposure for the ntc. (2) other nike entities purchase product directly from third party factories in u.s. dollars. these purchases generate a foreign currency exposure for those nike entities with a functional currency other than the u.s. dollar.the company operates a foreign currency adjustment program with certain factories. the program is designed to more effectively manage foreign currency risk by assuming certain of the factories foreign currency exposures, some of which are natural offsets to the company's existing foreign currency exposures. under this program, the companys payments to these factories are adjusted for rate fluctuations in the basket of currencies (factory currency exposure index) in which the labor, materials and overhead costs incurred by the factories in the production of nike branded products (factory input costs) are denominated. for the portion of the indices denominated in the local or functional currency of the factory, the company may elect to place formally designated cash flow hedges. for all currencies within the indices, excluding the u.s.dollar and the local or functional currency of the factory, an embedded derivative contract is created upon the factorys acceptance of nikes purchase order. embedded derivative contracts are separated from the related purchase order, as further described within the embedded derivatives section below.the companys policy permits the utilization of derivatives to reduce its foreign currency exposures where internal netting or other strategies cannot be effectively employed. typically, the company may enter into hedge contracts starting up to 12 to 24 months in advance of the forecasted transaction and may place incremental hedges up to 100% of the exposure by the time the forecasted transaction occurs. the total notional amount of outstanding foreign currency derivatives designated as cash flow hedges was$11.5 billionas of may31, 2016.70table of contentsas of may31, 2016, the company had a series of forward-starting interest rate swap agreements with a total outstanding notional amount of $1.5 billion. these instruments were designated as cash flow hedges of the variability in the expected cash outflows of interest payments on future debt due to changes in benchmark interest rates. during the second quarter of fiscal 2016, the company terminated certain forward-starting interest rate swaps with a total notional amount of $1 billion in connection with the october 29, 2015 debt issuance (refer to note8  long-term debt). upon termination of these forward-starting swaps, the company received a cash payment from the related counterparties of $34 million, which was recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income and will be released through interest expense (income), net as interest payments are made over the term of the issued debt.all changes in fair value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, excluding any ineffective portion, are recorded inaccumulated other comprehensive incomeuntilnet incomeis affected by the variability of cash flows of the hedged transaction. in most cases, amounts recorded inaccumulated other comprehensive incomewill be released tonet incomein periods following the maturity of the related derivative, rather than at maturity. effective hedge results are classified within the consolidated statements of income in the same manner as the underlying exposure. the results of hedges of non-functional currency denominated revenues and product cost exposures, excluding embedded derivatives, are recorded in revenues or cost of sales when the underlying hedged transaction affects consolidated net income. results of hedges of selling and administrative expense are recorded together with those costs when the related expense is recorded. amounts recorded inaccumulated other comprehensive incomerelated to forward-starting interest rate swaps will be released throughinterest expense (income), netas interest payments are made over the term of the issued debt. results of hedges of anticipated purchases and sales of u.s.dollar-denominated available-for-sale securities are recorded in other (income) expense, net when the securities are sold. results of hedges of certain anticipated intercompany transactions are recorded inother (income) expense, net when the transaction occurs. the company classifies the cash flows at settlement from these designated cash flow hedge derivatives in the same category as the cash flows from the related hedged items, primarily within the cash provided by operations component of the consolidated statements of cash flows.premiums paid or received on options are initially recorded as deferred charges or deferred credits, respectively. the company assesses the effectiveness of options based on the total cash flows method and records total changes in the options fair value to accumulated other comprehensive income to the degree they are effective.the company formally assesses, both at a hedges inception and on an ongoing basis, whether the derivatives that are used in the hedging transaction have been highly effective in offsetting changes in the cash flows of hedged items and whether those derivatives may be expected to remain highly effective in future periods. effectiveness for cash flow hedges is assessed based on changes in forward rates. ineffectiveness was 0 billion for the years ended may31, 2016, 2015 and 2014.the company discontinues hedge accounting prospectively when: (1)it determines that the derivative is no longer highly effective in offsetting changes in the cash flows of a hedged item (including hedged items such as firm commitments or forecasted transactions); (2) the derivative expires or is sold, terminated or exercised; (3)it is no longer probable that the forecasted transaction will occur; or (4) management determines that designating the derivative as a hedging instrument is no longer appropriate.when the company discontinues hedge accounting because it is no longer probable that the forecasted transaction will occur in the originally expected period, but is expected to occur within an additional two-month period of time thereafter, the gain or loss on the derivative remains in accumulated other comprehensive income and is reclassified to net income when the forecasted transaction affects consolidated net income. however, if it is probable that a forecasted transaction will not occur by the end of the originally specified time period or within an additional two-month period of time thereafter, the gains and losses that were in accumulated other comprehensive income will be recognized immediately in other (income) expense, net. in all situations in which hedge accounting is discontinued and the derivative remains outstanding, the company will carry the derivative at its fair value on the consolidated balance sheets, recognizing future changes in the fair value in other (income) expense, net. for the years ended may31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, the amounts recorded in other (income) expense, net as a result of the discontinuance of cash flow hedging because the forecasted transaction was no longer probable of occurring were immaterial.as of may31, 2016, $460 million of deferred net gains (net of tax) on both outstanding and matured derivatives in accumulated other comprehensive income are expected to be reclassified to net income during the next 12 months concurrent with the underlying hedged transactions also being recorded in net income. actual amounts ultimately reclassified to net income are dependent on the exchange rates in effect when derivative contracts that are currently outstanding mature. as of may31, 2016, the maximum term over which the company is hedging exposures to the variability of cash flows for its forecasted transactions was 24 months.fair value hedgesthe company is also exposed to the risk of changes in the fair value of certain fixed-rate debt attributable to changes in interest rates. derivatives used by the company to hedge this risk are receive-fixed, pay-variable interest rate swaps. all interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges of the related long-term debt meet the shortcut method requirements under the accounting standards for derivatives and hedging. accordingly, changes in the fair values of the interest rate swaps are considered to exactly offset changes in the fair value of the underlying long-term debt. the cash flows associated with the companys fair value hedges are periodic interest payments while the swaps are outstanding, which are reflected within the cash provided by operations component of the consolidated statements of cash flows.the company recorded no ineffectiveness from its interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges for the years ended may31, 2016, 2015 or 2014. on october 15, 2015, the company repaid the long-term debt which had previously been hedged with these interest rate swaps. accordingly, as of may31, 2016, the company hadno interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges.net investment hedgesthe company has, in the past, hedged and may, in the future, hedge the risk of variability in foreign-currency-denominated net investments in wholly-owned international operations. all changes in fair value of the derivatives designated as net investment hedges, except ineffective portions, are reported in accumulated other comprehensive income along with the foreign currency translation adjustments on those investments. the company classifies the cash flows at settlement of its net investment hedges within the cash used by investing activities component of the consolidated statements of cash flows. the company assesses hedge effectiveness based on changes in forward rates. the company recorded no ineffectiveness from net investment hedges for the years ended may31, 2016, 2015 or 2014. the company had no outstanding net investment hedges as of may31, 2016.71table of contentsundesignated derivative instrumentsthe company may elect to enter into foreign exchange forwards to mitigate the change in fair value of specific assets and liabilities on the balance sheet and/or the embedded derivative contracts. these forwards are not designated as hedging instruments under the accounting standards for derivatives and hedging. accordingly, these undesignated instruments are recorded at fair value as a derivative asset or liability on the consolidated balance sheets with their corresponding change in fair value recognized inother (income) expense, net, together with the re-measurement gain or loss from the hedged balance sheet position or embedded derivative contract. the company classifies the cash flows at settlement from undesignated instruments in the same category as the cash flows from the related hedged items, primarily within the cash provided by operations component of the consolidated statements of cash flows. the total notional amount of outstanding undesignated derivative instruments was$7.1 billionas ofmay31, 2016.embedded derivativesas part of the foreign currency adjustment program described above, an embedded derivative contract is created upon the factorys acceptance of nikes purchase order for currencies within the factory currency exposure indices that are neither the u.s.dollar nor the local or functional currency of the factory. embedded derivative contracts are treated as foreign currency forward contracts that are bifurcated from the related purchase order and recorded at fair value as a derivative asset or liability on the consolidated balance sheets with their corresponding change in fair value recognized inother (income) expense, net, from the date a purchase order is accepted by a factory through the date the purchase price is no longer subject to foreign currency fluctuations.in addition, the company has entered into certain other contractual agreements which have payments that are indexed to currencies that are not the functional currency of either substantial party to the contracts. these payment terms expose nike to variability in foreign exchange rates and create embedded derivative contracts that must be bifurcated from the related contract and recorded at fair value as derivative assets or liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets with their corresponding changes in fair value recognized inother (income) expense, net until each payment is settled.at may31, 2016, the notional amount of all embedded derivatives outstanding was approximately $282 million. credit riskthe company is exposed to credit-related losses in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to hedging instruments. the counterparties to all derivative transactions are major financial institutions with investment grade credit ratings. however, this does not eliminate the companys exposure to credit risk with these institutions. this credit risk is limited to the unrealized gains in such contracts should any of these counterparties fail to perform as contracted. to manage this risk, the company has established strict counterparty credit guidelines that are continually monitored.the companys derivative contracts contain credit risk related contingent features designed to protect against significant deterioration in counterparties creditworthiness and their ultimate ability to settle outstanding derivative contracts in the normal course of business. the companys bilateral credit related contingent features generally require the owing entity, either the company or the derivative counterparty, to post collateral for the portion of the fair value in excess of $50 million should the fair value of outstanding derivatives per counterparty be greater than $50 million. additionally, a certain level of decline in credit rating of either the company or the counterparty could also trigger collateral requirements. as ofmay31, 2016, the company was in compliance with all credit risk-related contingent features and had derivative instruments with credit risk-related contingent features in a net liability position of $3 million. accordingly, the company was not required to post any collateral as a result of these contingent features. further, as ofmay31, 2016, the company had received$105 millionof cash collateral from various counterparties to its derivative contracts (refer tonote6  fair value measurements). given the considerations described above, the company considers the impact of the risk of counterparty default to be immaterial.note17  operating segments and related informationthe companys operating segments are evidence of the structure of the company's internal organization. the nike brand segments are defined by geographic regions for operations participating in nike brand sales activity.each nike brand geographic segment operates predominantly in one industry: the design, development, marketing and selling of athletic footwear, apparel and equipment. the companys reportable operating segments for the nike brand are: north america, western europe, central& eastern europe, greater china, japan and emerging markets, and include results for the nike, jordan and hurley brands. the companys nike brand direct to consumer operations are managed within each geographic operating segment. converse is also a reportable segment for the company, and operates in one industry: the design, marketing, licensing and selling of casual sneakers, apparel and accessories.global brand divisions is included within the nike brand for presentation purposes to align with the way management views the company. global brand divisions primarily represent nike brand licensing businesses that are not part of a geographic operating segment, and demand creation, operating overhead and product creation and design expenses that are centrally managed for the nike brand. corporate consists largely of unallocated general and administrative expenses, including expenses associated with centrally managed departments; depreciation and amortization related to the companys headquarters; unallocated insurance, benefit and compensation programs, including stock-based compensation; and certain foreign currency gains and losses, including certain hedge gains and losses.72table of contentsthe primary financial measure used by the company to evaluate performance of individual operating segments is earnings before interest and taxes (commonly referred to as ebit), which represents net income before interest expense (income), net and income tax expense in the consolidated statements of income.as part of the company's centrally managed foreign exchange risk management program, standard foreign currency rates are assigned twice per year to each nike brand entity in the company's geographic operating segments and to converse. these rates are set approximately nine and twelve months in advance of the future selling seasons to which they relate (specifically, for each currency, one standard rate applies to the fall and holiday selling seasons and one standard rate applies to the spring and summer selling seasons) based on average market spot rates in the calendar month preceding the date they are established. inventories and cost of sales for geographic operating segments and converse reflect use of these standard rates to record non-functional currency product purchases in the entitys functional currency. differences between assigned standard foreign currency rates and actual market rates are included in corporate, together with foreign currency hedge gains and losses generated from the company's centrally managed foreign exchange risk management program and other conversion gains and losses.accounts receivable, net, inventories and property, plant and equipment, net for operating segments are regularly reviewed by management and are therefore provided below. additions to long-lived assets as presented in the following table represent capital expenditures.certain prior year amounts have
