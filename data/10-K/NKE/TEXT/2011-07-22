GENERAL

NIKE, INC. WAS INCORPORATED IN 1968 UNDER THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF OREGON. AS USED IN THIS REPORT, THE TERMS

WE, US, NIKE AND THE COMPANY REFER TO NIKE, INC. AND ITS PREDECESSORS, SUBSIDIARIES AND AFFILIATES, UNLESS THE CONTEXT INDICATES OTHERWISE. OUR INTERNET ADDRESS IS

WWW.NIKE.COM.

ON OUR NIKE

CORPORATE WEB SITE, LOCATED AT

WWW.NIKEBIZ.COM,

WE POST THE FOLLOWING FILINGS AS SOON AS REASONABLY PRACTICABLE AFTER THEY ARE ELECTRONICALLY FILED WITH OR FURNISHED TO THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION: OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON

FORM 10-K, OUR QUARTERLY REPORTS ON FORM 10-Q, OUR CURRENT REPORTS ON FORM 8-K AND ANY AMENDMENTS TO THOSE REPORTS FILED OR FURNISHED PURSUANT TO SECTION 13(A) OR 15(D) OF THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934, AS AMENDED. ALL SUCH

FILINGS ON OUR NIKE CORPORATE WEB SITE ARE AVAILABLE FREE OF CHARGE. ALSO AVAILABLE ON THE NIKE CORPORATE WEB SITE ARE THE CHARTERS OF THE COMMITTEES OF OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS, AS WELL AS OUR CORPORATE GOVERNANCE GUIDELINES AND CODE OF ETHICS;

OUR PRINCIPAL BUSINESS ACTIVITY IS THE DESIGN, DEVELOPMENT AND WORLDWIDE MARKETING AND SELLING OF HIGH QUALITY FOOTWEAR, APPAREL,

EQUIPMENT, AND ACCESSORY PRODUCTS. NIKE IS THE LARGEST SELLER OF ATHLETIC FOOTWEAR AND ATHLETIC APPAREL IN THE WORLD. WE SELL OUR PRODUCTS TO RETAIL ACCOUNTS, THROUGH NIKE-OWNED RETAIL STORES AND INTERNET SALES, WHICH WE REFER TO AS OUR DIRECT

TO CONSUMER OPERATIONS, AND THROUGH A MIX OF INDEPENDENT DISTRIBUTORS AND LICENSEES, IN OVER 170 COUNTRIES AROUND THE WORLD. VIRTUALLY ALL OF OUR PRODUCTS ARE MANUFACTURED BY INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS. VIRTUALLY ALL FOOTWEAR AND APPAREL PRODUCTS

ARE PRODUCED OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES, WHILE EQUIPMENT PRODUCTS ARE PRODUCED BOTH IN THE UNITED STATES AND ABROAD.

PRODUCTS

NIKES ATHLETIC FOOTWEAR PRODUCTS ARE DESIGNED PRIMARILY FOR SPECIFIC ATHLETIC USE, ALTHOUGH A LARGE PERCENTAGE OF THE PRODUCTS ARE WORN FOR CASUAL OR LEISURE PURPOSES. WE PLACE CONSIDERABLE EMPHASIS

ON HIGH QUALITY CONSTRUCTION AND INNOVATION IN PRODUCTS DESIGNED FOR MEN, WOMEN AND CHILDREN. RUNNING, TRAINING, BASKETBALL, SOCCER, SPORT-INSPIRED CASUAL SHOES, AND KIDS SHOES ARE CURRENTLY OUR TOP-SELLING FOOTWEAR CATEGORIES AND WE EXPECT

THEM TO CONTINUE TO LEAD IN PRODUCT SALES IN THE NEAR FUTURE. WE ALSO MARKET FOOTWEAR DESIGNED FOR BASEBALL, CHEERLEADING, FOOTBALL, GOLF, LACROSSE, OUTDOOR ACTIVITIES, SKATEBOARDING, TENNIS, VOLLEYBALL, WALKING, WRESTLING, AND OTHER ATHLETIC AND

RECREATIONAL USES.

WE SELL SPORTS APPAREL AND ACCESSORIES COVERING MOST OF THE ABOVE CATEGORIES, SPORTS-INSPIRED LIFESTYLE

APPAREL, AS WELL AS ATHLETIC BAGS AND ACCESSORY ITEMS. NIKE APPAREL AND ACCESSORIES FEATURE THE SAME TRADEMARKS AND ARE SOLD THROUGH THE SAME MARKETING AND DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS. WE OFTEN MARKET FOOTWEAR, APPAREL AND ACCESSORIES IN

COLLECTIONS OF SIMILAR DESIGN OR FOR SPECIFIC PURPOSES. WE ALSO MARKET APPAREL WITH LICENSED COLLEGE AND PROFESSIONAL TEAM AND LEAGUE LOGOS.

WE SELL A LINE OF PERFORMANCE EQUIPMENT UNDER THE NIKE BRAND NAME, INCLUDING BAGS, SOCKS, SPORT BALLS, EYEWEAR, TIMEPIECES, ELECTRONIC DEVICES, BATS, GLOVES, PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT, GOLF CLUBS, AND OTHER

SALES AND

MARKETING

FINANCIAL INFORMATION ABOUT GEOGRAPHIC AND SEGMENT OPERATIONS APPEARS IN NOTE 18 OF THE ACCOMPANYING NOTES TO

THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ON PAGE 83.

WE EXPERIENCE MODERATE FLUCTUATIONS IN AGGREGATE SALES VOLUME DURING THE

YEAR. HISTORICALLY, REVENUES IN THE FIRST AND FOURTH FISCAL QUARTERS HAVE SLIGHTLY EXCEEDED THOSE IN THE SECOND AND THIRD QUARTERS. HOWEVER, THE MIX OF PRODUCT SALES MAY VARY CONSIDERABLY AS A RESULT OF CHANGES IN SEASONAL AND GEOGRAPHIC DEMAND FOR

PARTICULAR TYPES OF FOOTWEAR, APPAREL AND EQUIPMENT.

BECAUSE NIKE IS A CONSUMER PRODUCTS COMPANY, THE RELATIVE POPULARITY OF

VARIOUS SPORTS AND FITNESS ACTIVITIES AND CHANGING DESIGN TRENDS AFFECT THE DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS. WE MUST THEREFORE RESPOND TO TRENDS AND SHIFTS IN CONSUMER PREFERENCES BY ADJUSTING THE MIX OF EXISTING PRODUCT OFFERINGS, DEVELOPING NEW PRODUCTS,

STYLES AND CATEGORIES, AND INFLUENCING SPORTS AND FITNESS PREFERENCES THROUGH AGGRESSIVE MARKETING. FAILURE TO RESPOND IN A TIMELY AND ADEQUATE MANNER COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR SALES AND PROFITABILITY. THIS IS A CONTINUING RISK.

WE REPORT OUR NIKE BRAND OPERATIONS BASED ON OUR INTERNAL GEOGRAPHIC ORGANIZATION. EACH NIKE BRAND GEOGRAPHY OPERATES

PREDOMINANTLY IN ONE INDUSTRY: THE DESIGN, DEVELOPMENT, MARKETING AND SELLING OF ATHLETIC FOOTWEAR, APPAREL, AND EQUIPMENT. EFFECTIVE JUNE 1, 2009, WE BEGAN OPERATING UNDER OUR NEW ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE FOR THE NIKE BRAND, WHICH

CONSISTS OF THE FOLLOWING SIX GEOGRAPHIES: NORTH AMERICA, WESTERN EUROPE, CENTRAL & EASTERN EUROPE, GREATER CHINA, JAPAN, AND EMERGING MARKETS. PREVIOUSLY, NIKE BRAND OPERATIONS WERE ORGANIZED INTO THE FOLLOWING FOUR GEOGRAPHIC REGIONS: U.S.,

EUROPE, MIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA (COLLECTIVELY, EMEA), ASIA PACIFIC, AND AMERICAS. OUR NIKE BRAND DIRECT TO CONSUMER OPERATIONS ARE MANAGED WITHIN EACH GEOGRAPHIC SEGMENT.

UNITED STATES MARKET

IN FISCAL 2011, SALES IN

THE UNITED STATES INCLUDING U.S. SALES OF OUR OTHER BUSINESSES ACCOUNTED FOR APPROXIMATELY 43% OF TOTAL REVENUES, COMPARED TO 42% IN FISCAL 2010 AND 2009. OUR OTHER BUSINESSES WERE PRIMARILY COMPRISED OF OUR AFFILIATE BRANDS; COLE HAAN,

CONVERSE, HURLEY AND UMBRO (WHICH WAS ACQUIRED ON MARCH 3, 2008); AND NIKE GOLF. WE ESTIMATE THAT WE SELL TO MORE THAN 20,000 RETAIL ACCOUNTS IN THE UNITED STATES. THE NIKE BRAND DOMESTIC RETAIL ACCOUNT BASE INCLUDES A MIX OF FOOTWEAR STORES,

SPORTING GOODS STORES, ATHLETIC SPECIALTY STORES, DEPARTMENT STORES, SKATE, TENNIS AND GOLF SHOPS, AND OTHER RETAIL ACCOUNTS. DURING FISCAL 2011, OUR THREE LARGEST CUSTOMERS ACCOUNTED FOR APPROXIMATELY 23% OF SALES IN THE UNITED STATES.

WE MAKE SUBSTANTIAL USE OF OUR FUTURES ORDERING PROGRAM, WHICH ALLOWS RETAILERS TO ORDER FIVE TO SIX MONTHS IN ADVANCE

OF DELIVERY WITH THE COMMITMENT THAT THEIR ORDERS WILL BE DELIVERED WITHIN A SET TIME PERIOD AT A FIXED PRICE. IN FISCAL 2011, 87% OF OUR U.S. WHOLESALE FOOTWEAR SHIPMENTS (EXCLUDING OUR OTHER BUSINESSES) WERE MADE UNDER THE FUTURES PROGRAM,

COMPARED TO 89% IN FISCAL 2010 AND 2009. IN FISCAL 2011, 60% OF OUR U.S. WHOLESALE APPAREL SHIPMENTS (EXCLUDING OUR OTHER BUSINESSES) WERE MADE UNDER THE FUTURES PROGRAM, COMPARED TO 62% IN FISCAL 2010 AND 60% IN FISCAL 2009.

ORDERS

WORLDWIDE FUTURES AND ADVANCE ORDERS FOR

NIKE BRAND ATHLETIC FOOTWEAR AND APPAREL, SCHEDULED FOR DELIVERY FROM JUNE THROUGH NOVEMBER 2011, WERE $10.3 BILLION COMPARED TO $8.8 BILLION FOR THE SAME PERIOD LAST YEAR. THIS FUTURES AND ADVANCE ORDER AMOUNT IS CALCULATED BASED UPON OUR FORECAST

OF THE ACTUAL EXCHANGE RATES UNDER WHICH OUR REVENUES WILL BE TRANSLATED DURING THIS PERIOD, WHICH APPROXIMATE CURRENT SPOT RATES. REPORTED FUTURES AND ADVANCE ORDERS ARE NOT NECESSARILY INDICATIVE OF OUR EXPECTATION OF REVENUES FOR THIS PERIOD.

THIS IS BECAUSE THE MIX OF ORDERS CAN SHIFT BETWEEN FUTURES/ADVANCE AND AT-ONCE ORDERS AND THE FULFILLMENT OF CERTAIN OF THESE FUTURES/ADVANCE ORDERS MAY FALL OUTSIDE OF THE SCHEDULED TIME PERIOD NOTED ABOVE. IN ADDITION, FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE

RATE FLUCTUATIONS AS WELL AS DIFFERING LEVELS OF ORDER CANCELLATIONS AND DISCOUNTS CAN CAUSE DIFFERENCES IN THE COMPARISONS BETWEEN FUTURES AND ADVANCE ORDERS AND ACTUAL REVENUES. MOREOVER, A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR REVENUE IS NOT DERIVED FROM

FUTURES AND ADVANCE ORDERS, INCLUDING AT-ONCE AND CLOSE-OUT SALES OF NIKE BRAND FOOTWEAR AND APPAREL, SALES OF NIKE BRAND EQUIPMENT, SALES FROM OUR DIRECT TO CONSUMER OPERATIONS, AND SALES FROM OUR OTHER BUSINESSES.

PRODUCT RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

WE BELIEVE OUR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS ARE A KEY FACTOR IN OUR PAST AND FUTURE SUCCESS. TECHNICAL INNOVATION IN THE DESIGN OF FOOTWEAR, APPAREL, AND ATHLETIC EQUIPMENT RECEIVE CONTINUED EMPHASIS

AS NIKE STRIVES TO PRODUCE PRODUCTS THAT HELP TO REDUCE INJURY, ENHANCE ATHLETIC PERFORMANCE AND MAXIMIZE COMFORT.

IN

ADDITION TO NIKES OWN STAFF OF SPECIALISTS IN THE AREAS OF BIOMECHANICS, CHEMISTRY, EXERCISE PHYSIOLOGY, ENGINEERING, INDUSTRIAL DESIGN, AND RELATED FIELDS, WE ALSO UTILIZE RESEARCH COMMITTEES AND ADVISORY BOARDS MADE UP OF ATHLETES, COACHES,

TRAINERS, EQUIPMENT MANAGERS, ORTHOPEDISTS, PODIATRISTS, AND OTHER EXPERTS WHO CONSULT WITH US AND REVIEW DESIGNS, MATERIALS, CONCEPTS FOR PRODUCT IMPROVEMENTS AND COMPLIANCE WITH PRODUCT SAFETY REGULATIONS AROUND THE WORLD. EMPLOYEE ATHLETES,

ATHLETES ENGAGED UNDER SPORTS MARKETING CONTRACTS AND OTHER ATHLETES WEAR-TEST AND EVALUATE PRODUCTS DURING THE DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT PROCESS.

MANUFACTURING

VIRTUALLY ALL OF OUR FOOTWEAR IS PRODUCED BY FACTORIES WE CONTRACT WITH OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES. IN FISCAL 2011, CONTRACT FACTORIES IN VIETNAM, CHINA, INDONESIA, AND INDIA MANUFACTURED APPROXIMATELY

39%, 33%, 24% AND 2% OF TOTAL NIKE BRAND FOOTWEAR, RESPECTIVELY. WE ALSO HAVE MANUFACTURING AGREEMENTS WITH INDEPENDENT FACTORIES IN ARGENTINA, BRAZIL, INDIA, AND MEXICO TO MANUFACTURE FOOTWEAR FOR SALE PRIMARILY WITHIN THOSE COUNTRIES. THE LARGEST

SINGLE FOOTWEAR FACTORY THAT WE HAVE CONTRACTED WITH ACCOUNTED FOR APPROXIMATELY 6% OF TOTAL FISCAL 2011 NIKE BRAND FOOTWEAR PRODUCTION. ALMOST ALL OF NIKE BRAND APPAREL IS MANUFACTURED OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES BY INDEPENDENT CONTRACT

MANUFACTURERS LOCATED IN 33 COUNTRIES. MOST OF THIS APPAREL PRODUCTION OCCURRED IN CHINA, THAILAND, VIETNAM, MALAYSIA, SRI LANKA, INDONESIA, TURKEY, CAMBODIA, EL SALVADOR, AND MEXICO. THE LARGEST SINGLE APPAREL FACTORY THAT WE HAVE CONTRACTED WITH

ACCOUNTED FOR APPROXIMATELY 7% OF TOTAL FISCAL 2011 APPAREL PRODUCTION.

THE PRINCIPAL MATERIALS USED IN OUR FOOTWEAR PRODUCTS

ARE NATURAL AND SYNTHETIC RUBBER, PLASTIC COMPOUNDS, FOAM CUSHIONING MATERIALS, NYLON, LEATHER, CANVAS, AND POLYURETHANE FILMS USED TO MAKE AIR-SOLE CUSHIONING COMPONENTS. DURING FISCAL 2011, NIKE IHM, INC., A WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARY OF NIKE, AS

WELL AS INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS IN CHINA AND TAIWAN, WERE OUR LARGEST SUPPLIERS OF THE AIR-SOLE CUSHIONING COMPONENTS USED IN FOOTWEAR. THE PRINCIPAL MATERIALS USED IN OUR APPAREL PRODUCTS ARE NATURAL AND SYNTHETIC FABRICS AND THREADS, PLASTIC AND

METAL HARDWARE, AND SPECIALIZED PERFORMANCE FABRICS DESIGNED TO REPEL RAIN, RETAIN HEAT, OR EFFICIENTLY TRANSPORT BODY MOISTURE. NIKES INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS AND SUPPLIERS BUY RAW MATERIALS IN BULK FOR THE MANUFACTURING OF OUR FOOTWEAR,

APPAREL AND EQUIPMENT PRODUCTS. MOST RAW MATERIALS ARE AVAILABLE AND PURCHASED

TABLE OF CONTENTS

BY THOSE INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS AND SUPPLIERS IN THE COUNTRIES WHERE MANUFACTURING TAKES PLACE. WE HAVE THUS FAR EXPERIENCED LITTLE DIFFICULTY IN SATISFYING OUR RAW MATERIAL REQUIREMENTS.

SINCE 1972, SOJITZ CORPORATION OF AMERICA (SOJITZ AMERICA), A LARGE JAPANESE TRADING COMPANY AND THE SOLE OWNER

OF OUR REDEEMABLE PREFERRED STOCK, HAS PERFORMED SIGNIFICANT IMPORT-EXPORT FINANCING SERVICES FOR US. DURING FISCAL 2011, SOJITZ AMERICA PROVIDED FINANCING AND PURCHASING SERVICES FOR NIKE BRAND PRODUCTS SOLD IN ARGENTINA, URUGUAY, CANADA, BRAZIL,

INDIA, INDONESIA, THE PHILIPPINES, MALAYSIA, SOUTH AFRICA, CHINA, KOREA, AND THAILAND, EXCLUDING PRODUCTS PRODUCED AND SOLD IN THE SAME COUNTRY. APPROXIMATELY 19% OF NIKE BRAND SALES OCCURRED IN THOSE COUNTRIES. ANY FAILURE OF SOJITZ AMERICA TO

PROVIDE THESE SERVICES OR ANY FAILURE OF SOJITZ AMERICAS BANKS COULD DISRUPT OUR ABILITY TO ACQUIRE PRODUCTS FROM OUR SUPPLIERS AND TO DELIVER PRODUCTS TO OUR CUSTOMERS IN THOSE JURISDICTIONS. SUCH A DISRUPTION COULD RESULT IN CANCELLED ORDERS

THAT WOULD ADVERSELY AFFECT SALES AND PROFITABILITY. HOWEVER, WE BELIEVE THAT ANY SUCH DISRUPTION WOULD BE SHORT-TERM IN DURATION DUE TO THE READY AVAILABILITY OF ALTERNATIVE SOURCES OF FINANCING AT COMPETITIVE RATES. OUR CURRENT AGREEMENTS WITH

SOJITZ AMERICA EXPIRE ON MAY 31, 2014.

INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS AND TRADE

OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS AND SOURCES OF SUPPLY ARE SUBJECT TO THE USUAL RISKS OF DOING BUSINESS ABROAD, SUCH AS POSSIBLE REVALUATION

OF CURRENCIES, EXPORT AND IMPORT DUTIES, ANTI-DUMPING MEASURES, QUOTAS, SAFEGUARD MEASURES, TRADE RESTRICTIONS, RESTRICTIONS ON THE TRANSFER OF FUNDS AND, IN CERTAIN PARTS OF THE WORLD, POLITICAL INSTABILITY AND TERRORISM. WE HAVE NOT, TO DATE, BEEN

MATERIALLY AFFECTED BY ANY SUCH RISK, BUT CANNOT PREDICT THE LIKELIHOOD OF SUCH DEVELOPMENTS OCCURRING.

THE GLOBAL ECONOMIC

RECESSION RESULTED IN A SIGNIFICANT SLOW-DOWN IN INTERNATIONAL TRADE AND A SHARP RISE IN PROTECTIONIST ACTIONS AROUND THE WORLD. THESE TRENDS ARE AFFECTING MANY GLOBAL MANUFACTURING AND SERVICE SECTORS, AND THE FOOTWEAR AND APPAREL INDUSTRIES,

AS A WHOLE, ARE NOT IMMUNE. COMPANIES IN OUR INDUSTRY ARE FACING TRADE PROTECTIONIST CHALLENGES IN MANY DIFFERENT REGIONS, AND IN NEARLY ALL CASES WE ARE WORKING TOGETHER TO ADDRESS TRADE ISSUES TO REDUCE THE IMPACT TO THE INDUSTRY, WHILE OBSERVING

APPLICABLE COMPETITION LAWS. NOTWITHSTANDING OUR EFFORTS, SUCH ACTIONS, IF IMPLEMENTED, COULD RESULT IN INCREASES IN THE COST OF OUR PRODUCTS, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR SALES OR PROFITABILITY AND THE IMPORTED FOOTWEAR AND APPAREL INDUSTRY AS

A WHOLE. ACCORDINGLY, WE ARE ACTIVELY MONITORING THE DEVELOPMENTS DESCRIBED BELOW.

FOOTWEAR IMPORTS INTO THE EUROPEAN

UNION

IN 2005, AT THE REQUEST OF THE EUROPEAN DOMESTIC FOOTWEAR INDUSTRY, THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION (EC)

INITIATED INVESTIGATIONS INTO LEATHER FOOTWEAR IMPORTED FROM CHINA AND VIETNAM. TOGETHER WITH OTHER COMPANIES IN OUR INDUSTRY, WE TOOK THE POSITION THAT SPECIAL TECHNOLOGY ATHLETIC FOOTWEAR (STAF) (I) SHOULD NOT BE WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THE

INVESTIGATION, AND (II) DOES NOT MEET THE LEGAL REQUIREMENTS OF INJURY AND PRICE IN AN ANTI-DUMPING INVESTIGATION. OUR ARGUMENTS WERE SUCCESSFUL AND THE EU AGREED IN OCTOBER 2006 ON DEFINITIVE DUTIES OF 16.5% FOR CHINA AND 10% FOR VIETNAM FOR

NON-STAF LEATHER FOOTWEAR, BUT EXCLUDED STAF FROM THE FINAL MEASURES. PRIOR TO THE SCHEDULED EXPIRATION IN OCTOBER 2008 OF THE MEASURES IMPOSED ON THE NON-STAF FOOTWEAR, THE DOMESTIC INDUSTRY REQUESTED AND THE EC AGREED TO REVIEW A PETITION TO

EXTEND THESE RESTRICTIONS ON NON-STAF LEATHER FOOTWEAR. IN DECEMBER 2009, FOLLOWING A REVIEW OF THE ONGOING RESTRICTIONS, EU MEMBER STATES VOTED TO EXTEND THE MEASURES FOR AN ADDITIONAL 15 MONTHS, UNTIL MARCH 31, 2011. IN EARLY 2011, THE EC

DECLINED TO FURTHER EXTEND THE MEASURES AND SINCE APRIL 1, 2011 THESE RESTRICTIONS HAVE BEEN TERMINATED. THE EC NOTED THAT IT WILL BE MONITORING LEATHER FOOTWEAR IMPORTS FROM VIETNAM AND CHINA OVER THE NEXT 12 MONTHS AND IT IS HOPED THAT ANY

INCREASES WILL NOT RESULT IN RENEWED TRADE DEFENSE ACTIONS BY THE EC.

ON FEBRUARY 3, 2010, THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT

ANNOUNCED IT WOULD SEEK TO REFER THE EU DECISION (BOTH ON THE ORIGINAL MEASURES AND SUBSEQUENT REVIEW DECISION) TO THE WORLD TRADE ORGANIZATION (WTO) FOR ITS FURTHER REVIEW AND DECISION. ON MAY 18, 2010, THE DISPUTE SETTLEMENT BODY

OF THE WTO AGREED TO ESTABLISH A PANEL TO RULE ON CHINAS CLAIMS AGAINST THE EU WITH RESPECT TO THE ABOVE ANTI-DUMPING MEASURES. THE RULING FROM THE WTO PANEL IS EXPECTED IN LATE JULY OR AUGUST 2011, AFTER WHICH EITHER PARTY MAY ACCEPT OR

APPEAL THE FINDINGS.

FOOTWEAR, APPAREL AND EQUIPMENT IMPORTS INTO BRAZIL AND ARGENTINA

AT THE REQUEST OF CERTAIN DOMESTIC FOOTWEAR INDUSTRY PARTICIPANTS, BOTH BRAZIL AND ARGENTINA HAVE INITIATED INDEPENDENT ANTI-DUMPING

INVESTIGATIONS AGAINST FOOTWEAR MADE IN CHINA. OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS, WE HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH A BROAD COALITION OF OTHER COMPANIES IN OUR INDUSTRY TO CHALLENGE THESE CASES ON THE BASIS THAT THE ATHLETIC FOOTWEAR BEING IMPORTED FROM CHINA

(I) SHOULD NOT BE WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THE INVESTIGATION, AND (II) DOES NOT MEET THE LEGAL REQUIREMENTS OF INJURY AND PRICE IN AN ANTI-DUMPING INVESTIGATION. IN THE CASE OF ARGENTINA, IN 2010, THE FINAL DETERMINATION MADE BY THE

ADMINISTERING AUTHORITIES WAS FAVORABLE TO US. IN THE CASE OF BRAZIL, THE ADMINISTERING AUTHORITIES AGREED TO IMPOSE AN ANTI-DUMPING DUTY AGAINST NEARLY ALL FOOTWEAR FROM CHINA, WHICH WE BELIEVE WILL IMPACT ALL BRANDS IN THE FOOTWEAR INDUSTRY.

ALTHOUGH WE DO NOT CURRENTLY EXPECT THAT THIS DECISION WILL MATERIALLY AFFECT US, WE ARE WORKING WITH THE SAME BROAD COALITION OF FOOTWEAR COMPANIES TO CHALLENGE THIS DECISION IN DOMESTIC BRAZILIAN COURTS AS WELL AS INTERNATIONAL FORUMS SUCH AS THE

WTO.

MANY PRODUCTS, INCLUDING FOOTWEAR, APPAREL AND EQUIPMENT PRODUCTS, THAT WE AND OTHERS IN OUR INDUSTRY IMPORT INTO

ARGENTINA AND BRAZIL ARE SUBJECT TO THE WTO NON-AUTOMATIC LICENSING REQUIREMENTS, WHICH MEANS THAT IT MAY TAKE UP TO 60 DAYS FOR THOSE PRODUCTS TO CLEAR CUSTOMS AND ENTER INTO THOSE JURISDICTIONS. FROM TIME TO TIME, IN ADDITION TO THESE WTO

LICENSING REQUIREMENTS, THESE JURISDICTIONS IMPOSE FURTHER IMPORTATION RESTRICTIONS OR LIMITATIONS. AS A RESULT, WE HAVE EXPERIENCED DELAYS IN OUR ABILITY TO IMPORT OUR PRODUCTS OR IT HAS TAKEN LONGER THAN THE TIME ALLOWED UNDER THE WTO FOR US TO

IMPORT OUR PRODUCTS. TO DATE, OUR BUSINESS HAS NOT BEEN MATERIALLY AFFECTED BY THESE RESTRICTIONS OR DELAYS. IN THE FUTURE, HOWEVER, IF WE ARE UNABLE TO IMPORT OUR PRODUCTS INTO THESE JURISDICTIONS DUE TO THESE OR OTHER RESTRICTIONS OR IF WE

EXPERIENCE INCREASING OR MORE FREQUENT DELAYS BEYOND THE WTO-PERMITTED 60 DAYS TO IMPORT OUR PRODUCTS, OUR BUSINESS COULD BE MATERIALLY AFFECTED.

FOOTWEAR, APPAREL AND EQUIPMENT IMPORTS INTO TURKEY

IN 2006, TURKEY

INTRODUCED SAFEGUARD MEASURES IN THE FORM OF ADDITIONAL DUTIES ON ALL IMPORTED FOOTWEAR INTO TURKEY WITH THE GOAL OF PROTECTING ITS LOCAL SHOE MANUFACTURING INDUSTRY UNTIL AUGUST 2009. IN JUNE 2009, TURKISH SHOE-MANUFACTURERS SUBMITTED, AND THE

TURKISH GOVERNMENT AGREED TO REVIEW, A REQUEST FOR EXTENSION OF THE SAFEGUARD MEASURES CLAIMING THAT THE REHABILITATION PROCESS OF THE LOCAL TURKISH INDUSTRY WAS INTERRUPTED DUE TO THE CONTINUING INCREASE OF FOOTWEAR IMPORTS. DESPITE THE IMPORTERS

OPPOSITION TO THE CONTINUATION OF THE SAFEGUARD MEASURES, THE TURKISH AUTHORITIES EXTENDED THESE SAFEGUARD MEASURES UNTIL AUGUST 2012, BUT REDUCED THE DUTY FROM $3 PER PAIR OF FOOTWEAR TO $1.60 PER PAIR OF FOOTWEAR.

IN 2011, TWO NEW SAFEGUARD MEASURES AND REVIEWS WERE INITIATED BY THE TURKISH UNDERSECRETARIAT OF FOREIGN TRADE (UFT) ON

APPAREL AND EQUIPMENT IMPORTS. IN JANUARY 2011, THE UFT BEGAN AN INVESTIGATION ON APPAREL IMPORTS THAT COULD RESULT IN A 20-30% INCREASE IN IMPORT DUTIES APPLIED TO IMPORTED APPAREL PRODUCTS, REGARDLESS OF COUNTRY OF ORIGIN AND WITH ONLY A FEW

EXCEPTIONS FOR COUNTRIES THAT CURRENTLY HAVE A FREE TRADE AGREEMENT WITH TURKEY. A DECISION IS EXPECTED IN LATE JULY 2011 AND IF APPROVED, THESE HIGHER IMPORT DUTIES WILL BE IN PLACE THROUGH JULY 2014. TOGETHER WITH OTHER COMPANIES IN OUR INDUSTRY,

WE ARE ADVOCATING FOR EXCLUSION OF CERTAIN APPAREL PRODUCTS USED FOR SPORTING ACTIVITIES THAT CANNOT BE MANUFACTURED IN TURKEY AND THEREFORE SHOULD NOT BE SUBJECT TO A HIGHER IMPORT DUTY. IN FEBRUARY 2011, THE UFT BEGAN A REVIEW OF EXISTING

SAFEGUARD MEASURE ON TRAVEL GOODS, HANDBAGS AND SIMILAR ACCESSORIES AND CONTAINERS LISTED UNDER APPLICABLE REGULATIONS. ONE TURKISH BAG MANUFACTURERS ASSOCIATION HAS REQUESTED THE CONTINUATION OF THE SAFEGUARD MEASURES THROUGH APRIL 2014, WITH THE

APPLICATION OF AN ADDITIONAL IMPORT DUTY OF 2.70 USD/KG (MAX. 4.25 USD/UNIT), REGARDLESS OF COUNTRY OF ORIGIN. TOGETHER WITH OTHER COMPANIES IN OUR INDUSTRY, WE ARE ADVOCATING FOR THE EXCLUSION OF NON-LEATHER BAGS FROM THE SCOPE OF THE CONTINUED

SAFEGUARDS.

TRADE RELATIONS WITH CHINA

CHINA REPRESENTS AN IMPORTANT SOURCING COUNTRY AND CONSUMER MARKETING COUNTRY FOR US. MANY GOVERNMENTS AROUND THE WORLD ARE CONCERNED ABOUT CHINAS GROWING AND FAST-PACED ECONOMY, COMPLIANCE WITH WTO

RULES, CURRENCY VALUATION, AND HIGH TRADE SURPLUSES. AS A RESULT, A WIDE RANGE OF LEGISLATIVE PROPOSALS HAVE BEEN INTRODUCED TO ADDRESS THESE CONCERNS. WHILE SOME OF THESE CONCERNS MAY BE JUSTIFIED, WE ARE WORKING WITH BROAD

6

TABLE OF CONTENTS

COALITIONS OF GLOBAL BUSINESSES AND TRADE ASSOCIATIONS REPRESENTING A WIDE VARIETY OF SECTORS (E.G., SERVICES, MANUFACTURING, AND AGRICULTURE) TO HELP ENSURE ANY LEGISLATION ENACTED AND

IMPLEMENTED (I) ADDRESSES LEGITIMATE AND CORE CONCERNS, (II) IS CONSISTENT WITH INTERNATIONAL TRADE RULES, AND (III) REFLECTS AND CONSIDERS CHINAS DOMESTIC ECONOMY AND THE IMPORTANT ROLE IT HAS IN THE GLOBAL ECONOMIC COMMUNITY.

WE BELIEVE OTHER COMPANIES IN OUR INDUSTRY AS WELL AS MOST OTHER MULTI-NATIONAL COMPANIES ARE IN A SIMILAR POSITION REGARDING THESE TRADE MEASURES.

IN THE EVENT ANY OF THESE TRADE PROTECTION MEASURES ARE IMPLEMENTED, WE BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO DEVELOP, OVER A PERIOD OF TIME, ADEQUATE ALTERNATIVE SOURCES OF SUPPLY FOR THE PRODUCTS OBTAINED

FROM OUR PRESENT SUPPLIERS. IF EVENTS PREVENTED US FROM ACQUIRING PRODUCTS FROM OUR SUPPLIERS IN A PARTICULAR COUNTRY, OUR OPERATIONS COULD BE TEMPORARILY DISRUPTED AND WE COULD EXPERIENCE AN ADVERSE FINANCIAL IMPACT. HOWEVER, WE BELIEVE WE

COULD ABATE ANY SUCH DISRUPTION, AND THAT MUCH OF THE ADVERSE IMPACT ON SUPPLY WOULD, THEREFORE, BE OF A SHORT-TERM NATURE. WE BELIEVE OUR PRINCIPAL COMPETITORS ARE SUBJECT TO SIMILAR RISKS.

COMPETITION

THE ATHLETIC FOOTWEAR, APPAREL, AND

EQUIPMENT INDUSTRY IS KEENLY COMPETITIVE IN THE UNITED STATES AND ON A WORLDWIDE BASIS. WE COMPETE INTERNATIONALLY WITH A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF ATHLETIC AND LEISURE SHOE COMPANIES, ATHLETIC AND LEISURE APPAREL COMPANIES, SPORTS EQUIPMENT COMPANIES,

AND LARGE COMPANIES HAVING DIVERSIFIED LINES OF ATHLETIC AND LEISURE SHOES, APPAREL, AND EQUIPMENT, INCLUDING ADIDAS, PUMA, AND OTHERS. THE INTENSE COMPETITION AND THE RAPID CHANGES IN TECHNOLOGY AND CONSUMER PREFERENCES IN THE MARKETS FOR ATHLETIC

AND LEISURE FOOTWEAR AND APPAREL, AND ATHLETIC EQUIPMENT, CONSTITUTE SIGNIFICANT RISK FACTORS IN OUR OPERATIONS.

NIKE IS THE

LARGEST SELLER OF ATHLETIC FOOTWEAR AND ATHLETIC APPAREL IN THE WORLD. PERFORMANCE AND RELIABILITY OF SHOES, APPAREL, AND EQUIPMENT, NEW PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT, PRICE, PRODUCT IDENTITY THROUGH MARKETING AND PROMOTION, AND CUSTOMER SUPPORT AND SERVICE

ARE IMPORTANT ASPECTS OF COMPETITION IN THE ATHLETIC FOOTWEAR, APPAREL, AND EQUIPMENT INDUSTRY. TO HELP MARKET OUR PRODUCTS, WE CONTRACT WITH PROMINENT AND INFLUENTIAL ATHLETES, COACHES, TEAMS, COLLEGES AND SPORTS LEAGUES TO ENDORSE OUR BRANDS AND

USE OUR PRODUCTS, AND WE ACTIVELY SPONSOR SPORTING EVENTS AND CLINICS. WE BELIEVE THAT WE ARE COMPETITIVE IN ALL OF THESE AREAS.

TRADEMARKS AND PATENTS

WE UTILIZE TRADEMARKS ON NEARLY ALL OF OUR PRODUCTS AND BELIEVE HAVING

DISTINCTIVE MARKS THAT ARE READILY IDENTIFIABLE IS AN IMPORTANT FACTOR IN CREATING A MARKET FOR OUR GOODS, IN IDENTIFYING OUR BRANDS AND THE COMPANY, AND IN DISTINGUISHING OUR GOODS FROM THE GOODS OF OTHERS. WE CONSIDER OUR NIKE

®

AND SWOOSH DESIGN

®

TRADEMARKS TO BE AMONG OUR MOST VALUABLE ASSETS AND WE HAVE REGISTERED THESE TRADEMARKS IN OVER 150 COUNTRIES. IN ADDITION, WE OWN MANY OTHER TRADEMARKS THAT WE

UTILIZE IN MARKETING OUR PRODUCTS. WE CONTINUE TO VIGOROUSLY PROTECT OUR TRADEMARKS AGAINST INFRINGEMENT.

NIKE HAS AN EXCLUSIVE, WORLDWIDE LICENSE TO MAKE AND SELL FOOTWEAR USING PATENTED AIR TECHNOLOGY. THE

PROCESS UTILIZES PRESSURIZED GAS ENCAPSULATED IN POLYURETHANE. SOME OF THE EARLY NIKE AIR

®

PATENTS HAVE EXPIRED,

WHICH MAY ENABLE COMPETITORS TO USE CERTAIN TYPES OF SIMILAR TECHNOLOGY. SUBSEQUENT NIKE AIR

®

PATENTS WILL NOT

EXPIRE FOR SEVERAL YEARS. WE ALSO HAVE HUNDREDS OF U.S. AND FOREIGN UTILITY PATENTS, AND THOUSANDS OF U.S. AND FOREIGN DESIGN PATENTS COVERING COMPONENTS AND FEATURES USED IN VARIOUS ATHLETIC AND LEISURE SHOES, APPAREL, AND EQUIPMENT. THESE PATENTS

EXPIRE AT VARIOUS TIMES, AND PATENTS ISSUED FOR APPLICATIONS FILED THIS YEAR WILL LAST FROM NOW TO 2025 FOR DESIGN PATENTS, AND FROM NOW TO 2031 FOR UTILITY PATENTS. WE BELIEVE OUR SUCCESS DEPENDS PRIMARILY UPON SKILLS IN DESIGN, RESEARCH AND

DEVELOPMENT, PRODUCTION, AND MARKETING RATHER THAN UPON OUR PATENT POSITION. HOWEVER, WE HAVE FOLLOWED A POLICY OF FILING APPLICATIONS FOR UNITED STATES AND FOREIGN PATENTS ON INVENTIONS, DESIGNS, AND IMPROVEMENTS THAT WE DEEM VALUABLE.

EMPLOYEES

AS OF MAY 31, 2011, WE HAD APPROXIMATELY 38,000 EMPLOYEES WORLDWIDE, WHICH INCLUDES RETAIL AND PART-TIME EMPLOYEES. MANAGEMENT CONSIDERS ITS RELATIONSHIP WITH EMPLOYEES TO BE EXCELLENT. NONE OF OUR

EMPLOYEES

IS REPRESENTED BY A UNION, EXCEPT FOR CERTAIN EMPLOYEES IN THE EMERGING MARKETS GEOGRAPHY, WHERE LOCAL LAW REQUIRES THOSE EMPLOYEES TO BE REPRESENTED BY A TRADE UNION, AND IN THE UNITED STATES,

WHERE CERTAIN EMPLOYEES OF COLE HAAN ARE REPRESENTED BY A UNION. ALSO, IN SOME COUNTRIES OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES, LOCAL LAWS REQUIRE REPRESENTATION FOR EMPLOYEES BY WORKS COUNCILS (SUCH AS IN CERTAIN COUNTRIES IN THE EUROPEAN UNION, IN WHICH

THEY ARE ENTITLED TO INFORMATION AND CONSULTATION ON CERTAIN COMPANY DECISIONS) OR OTHER EMPLOYEE REPRESENTATION BY AN ORGANIZATION SIMILAR TO A UNION, AND IN CERTAIN EUROPEAN COUNTRIES, WE ARE REQUIRED BY LOCAL LAW TO ENTER INTO AND/OR COMPLY WITH

(INDUSTRY WIDE OR NATIONAL) COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENTS. THERE HAS NEVER BEEN A MATERIAL INTERRUPTION OF OPERATIONS DUE TO LABOR DISAGREEMENTS.

NIKE OR ITS REPRESENTATIVES IN THIS REPORT, OTHER REPORTS, FILINGS WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION, PRESS RELEASES, CONFERENCES, OR OTHERWISE, ARE FORWARD-LOOKING

STATEMENTS WITHIN THE MEANING OF THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995 AND SECTION 21E OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934, AS AMENDED. FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS INCLUDE, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY STATEMENT THAT MAY

PREDICT, FORECAST, INDICATE, OR IMPLY FUTURE RESULTS, PERFORMANCE, OR ACHIEVEMENTS, AND MAY CONTAIN THE WORDS BELIEVE, ANTICIPATE, EXPECT, ESTIMATE, PROJECT, WILL BE, WILL

CONTINUE, WILL LIKELY RESULT, OR WORDS OR PHRASES OF SIMILAR MEANING. FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS INVOLVE RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES WHICH MAY CAUSE ACTUAL RESULTS TO DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS. THE RISKS AND

UNCERTAINTIES ARE DETAILED FROM TIME TO TIME IN REPORTS FILED BY NIKE WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION, INCLUDING FORMS 8-K, 10-Q, AND 10-K, AND INCLUDE, AMONG OTHERS, THE FOLLOWING: INTERNATIONAL, NATIONAL AND LOCAL GENERAL ECONOMIC AND

MARKET CONDITIONS; THE SIZE AND GROWTH OF THE OVERALL ATHLETIC FOOTWEAR, APPAREL, AND EQUIPMENT MARKETS; INTENSE COMPETITION AMONG DESIGNERS, MARKETERS, DISTRIBUTORS AND SELLERS OF ATHLETIC FOOTWEAR, APPAREL, AND EQUIPMENT FOR CONSUMERS AND

ENDORSERS; DEMOGRAPHIC CHANGES; CHANGES IN CONSUMER PREFERENCES; POPULARITY OF PARTICULAR DESIGNS, CATEGORIES OF PRODUCTS, AND SPORTS; SEASONAL AND GEOGRAPHIC DEMAND FOR NIKE PRODUCTS; DIFFICULTIES IN ANTICIPATING OR FORECASTING CHANGES IN CONSUMER

PREFERENCES, CONSUMER DEMAND FOR NIKE PRODUCTS, AND THE VARIOUS MARKET FACTORS DESCRIBED ABOVE; DIFFICULTIES IN IMPLEMENTING, OPERATING, AND MAINTAINING NIKES INCREASINGLY COMPLEX INFORMATION SYSTEMS AND CONTROLS, INCLUDING, WITHOUT

LIMITATION, THE SYSTEMS RELATED TO DEMAND AND SUPPLY PLANNING, AND INVENTORY CONTROL; INTERRUPTIONS IN DATA AND COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEMS; FLUCTUATIONS AND DIFFICULTY IN FORECASTING OPERATING RESULTS, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE FACT THAT

ADVANCE FUTURES ORDERS MAY NOT BE INDICATIVE OF FUTURE REVENUES DUE TO CHANGES IN SHIPMENT TIMING, AND THE CHANGING MIX OF FUTURES AND AT-ONCE ORDERS AND ORDER CANCELLATIONS; THE ABILITY OF NIKE TO SUSTAIN, MANAGE OR FORECAST ITS GROWTH

AND INVENTORIES; THE SIZE, TIMING AND MIX OF PURCHASES OF NIKES PRODUCTS; INCREASES IN THE COST OF MATERIALS AND ENERGY USED TO MANUFACTURE PRODUCTS, NEW PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT AND INTRODUCTION; THE ABILITY TO SECURE AND PROTECT TRADEMARKS,

OF FREIGHT AND TRANSPORTATION TO MEET DELIVERY DEADLINES; INCREASES IN BORROWING COSTS DUE TO ANY DECLINE IN OUR DEBT RATINGS; CHANGES IN BUSINESS STRATEGY OR DEVELOPMENT PLANS; GENERAL RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH DOING BUSINESS OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES,

INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, EXCHANGE RATE FLUCTUATIONS, IMPORT DUTIES, TARIFFS, QUOTAS, POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC INSTABILITY, AND TERRORISM; CHANGES IN GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS; THE IMPACT OF, INCLUDING BUSINESS AND LEGAL DEVELOPMENTS RELATING TO,

CLIMATE CHANGE; LIABILITY AND OTHER CLAIMS ASSERTED AGAINST NIKE; THE ABILITY TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN QUALIFIED PERSONNEL; AND OTHER FACTORS REFERENCED OR INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE IN THIS REPORT AND OTHER REPORTS.

THE RISKS INCLUDED HERE ARE NOT EXHAUSTIVE. OTHER SECTIONS OF THIS REPORT MAY INCLUDE ADDITIONAL FACTORS WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT

NIKES BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE. MOREOVER, NIKE OPERATES IN A VERY COMPETITIVE AND RAPIDLY CHANGING ENVIRONMENT. NEW RISK FACTORS EMERGE FROM TIME TO TIME AND IT IS NOT POSSIBLE FOR MANAGEMENT TO PREDICT ALL SUCH RISK FACTORS, NOR CAN

IT ASSESS THE IMPACT OF ALL SUCH RISK FACTORS ON NIKES BUSINESS OR THE EXTENT TO WHICH ANY FACTOR, OR COMBINATION OF FACTORS, MAY CAUSE ACTUAL RESULTS TO DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THOSE CONTAINED IN ANY FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS. GIVEN THESE

RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES, INVESTORS SHOULD NOT PLACE UNDUE RELIANCE ON FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS AS A PREDICTION OF ACTUAL RESULTS.

INVESTORS SHOULD ALSO BE AWARE THAT WHILE NIKE DOES, FROM TIME TO TIME, COMMUNICATE WITH SECURITIES ANALYSTS, IT IS AGAINST NIKES POLICY TO DISCLOSE TO THEM ANY MATERIAL NON-PUBLIC INFORMATION OR

OTHER CONFIDENTIAL COMMERCIAL INFORMATION. ACCORDINGLY, SHAREHOLDERS SHOULD NOT ASSUME THAT NIKE AGREES WITH ANY STATEMENT OR REPORT ISSUED BY ANY ANALYST IRRESPECTIVE OF THE CONTENT OF THE STATEMENT OR REPORT. FURTHERMORE, NIKE HAS A POLICY AGAINST

ISSUING OR CONFIRMING FINANCIAL FORECASTS OR PROJECTIONS ISSUED BY OTHERS. THUS, TO THE EXTENT THAT REPORTS ISSUED BY SECURITIES ANALYSTS CONTAIN ANY PROJECTIONS, FORECASTS OR OPINIONS, SUCH REPORTS ARE NOT THE RESPONSIBILITY OF NIKE.

OUR PRODUCTS FACE INTENSE COMPETITION.

NIKE IS A CONSUMER PRODUCTS COMPANY AND THE RELATIVE POPULARITY OF VARIOUS SPORTS AND FITNESS ACTIVITIES AND CHANGING DESIGN TRENDS AFFECT THE DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS. THE ATHLETIC FOOTWEAR, APPAREL, AND

EQUIPMENT

10

TABLE OF CONTENTS

INDUSTRY IS KEENLY COMPETITIVE IN THE UNITED STATES AND ON A WORLDWIDE BASIS. WE COMPETE INTERNATIONALLY WITH A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF ATHLETIC AND LEISURE SHOE COMPANIES, ATHLETIC AND LEISURE

APPAREL COMPANIES, SPORTS EQUIPMENT COMPANIES, AND LARGE COMPANIES HAVING DIVERSIFIED LINES OF ATHLETIC AND LEISURE SHOES, APPAREL, AND EQUIPMENT. WE ALSO COMPETE WITH OTHER COMPANIES FOR THE PRODUCTION CAPACITY OF INDEPENDENT MANUFACTURERS THAT

PRODUCE OUR PRODUCTS AND FOR IMPORT QUOTA CAPACITY.

OUR COMPETITORS PRODUCT OFFERINGS, TECHNOLOGIES, MARKETING

EXPENDITURES (INCLUDING EXPENDITURES FOR ADVERTISING AND ENDORSEMENTS), PRICING, COSTS OF PRODUCTION, AND CUSTOMER SERVICE ARE AREAS OF INTENSE COMPETITION. THIS, IN ADDITION TO RAPID CHANGES IN TECHNOLOGY AND CONSUMER PREFERENCES IN THE MARKETS FOR

ATHLETIC AND LEISURE FOOTWEAR AND APPAREL, AND ATHLETIC EQUIPMENT, CONSTITUTE SIGNIFICANT RISK FACTORS IN OUR OPERATIONS. IF WE DO NOT ADEQUATELY AND TIMELY ANTICIPATE AND RESPOND TO OUR COMPETITORS, OUR COSTS MAY INCREASE OR THE CONSUMER DEMAND FOR

OUR PRODUCTS MAY DECLINE SIGNIFICANTLY.

IF WE ARE UNABLE TO ANTICIPATE CONSUMER PREFERENCES AND DEVELOP NEW PRODUCTS, WE MAY NOT BE

ABLE TO MAINTAIN OR INCREASE OUR NET REVENUES AND PROFITS.

OUR SUCCESS DEPENDS ON OUR ABILITY TO IDENTIFY, ORIGINATE

AND DEFINE PRODUCT TRENDS AS WELL AS TO ANTICIPATE, GAUGE AND REACT TO CHANGING CONSUMER DEMANDS IN A TIMELY MANNER. ALL OF OUR PRODUCTS ARE SUBJECT TO CHANGING CONSUMER PREFERENCES THAT CANNOT BE PREDICTED WITH CERTAINTY. OUR NEW PRODUCTS MAY NOT

RECEIVE CONSUMER ACCEPTANCE AS CONSUMER PREFERENCES COULD SHIFT RAPIDLY TO DIFFERENT TYPES OF PERFORMANCE OR OTHER SPORTS APPAREL OR AWAY FROM THESE TYPES OF PRODUCTS ALTOGETHER, AND OUR FUTURE SUCCESS DEPENDS IN PART ON OUR ABILITY TO ANTICIPATE

AND RESPOND TO THESE CHANGES. IF WE FAIL TO ANTICIPATE ACCURATELY AND RESPOND TO TRENDS AND SHIFTS IN CONSUMER PREFERENCES BY ADJUSTING THE MIX OF EXISTING PRODUCT OFFERINGS, DEVELOPING NEW PRODUCTS, DESIGNS, STYLES AND CATEGORIES, AND INFLUENCING

SPORTS AND FITNESS PREFERENCES THROUGH AGGRESSIVE MARKETING, WE COULD EXPERIENCE LOWER SALES, EXCESS INVENTORIES AND LOWER PROFIT MARGINS, ANY OF WHICH COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

WE RELY ON TECHNICAL INNOVATION AND HIGH QUALITY PRODUCTS TO COMPETE IN THE MARKET FOR OUR PRODUCTS.

ALTHOUGH DESIGN AND AESTHETICS OF OUR PRODUCTS APPEAR TO BE THE MOST IMPORTANT FACTOR FOR CONSUMER ACCEPTANCE OF OUR PRODUCTS, TECHNICAL

INNOVATION AND QUALITY CONTROL IN THE DESIGN OF FOOTWEAR, APPAREL, AND ATHLETIC EQUIPMENT IS ALSO ESSENTIAL TO THE COMMERCIAL SUCCESS OF OUR PRODUCTS. RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT PLAYS A KEY ROLE IN TECHNICAL INNOVATION. WE RELY UPON SPECIALISTS IN THE

FIELDS OF BIOMECHANICS, EXERCISE PHYSIOLOGY, ENGINEERING, INDUSTRIAL DESIGN AND RELATED FIELDS, AS WELL AS RESEARCH COMMITTEES AND ADVISORY BOARDS MADE UP OF ATHLETES, COACHES, TRAINERS, EQUIPMENT MANAGERS, ORTHOPEDISTS, PODIATRISTS, AND OTHER

EXPERTS TO DEVELOP AND TEST CUTTING EDGE PERFORMANCE PRODUCTS. WHILE WE STRIVE TO PRODUCE PRODUCTS THAT HELP TO REDUCE INJURY, ENHANCE ATHLETIC PERFORMANCE AND MAXIMIZE COMFORT, IF WE FAIL TO INTRODUCE TECHNICAL INNOVATION IN OUR PRODUCTS CONSUMER

DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS COULD DECLINE, AND IF WE EXPERIENCE PROBLEMS WITH THE QUALITY OF OUR PRODUCTS, WE MAY INCUR SUBSTANTIAL EXPENSE TO REMEDY THE PROBLEMS.

FAILURE TO CONTINUE TO OBTAIN HIGH QUALITY ENDORSERS OF OUR PRODUCTS COULD HARM OUR BUSINESS.

WE ESTABLISH RELATIONSHIPS WITH PROFESSIONAL ATHLETES, SPORTS TEAMS AND LEAGUES TO EVALUATE, PROMOTE, AND ESTABLISH PRODUCT AUTHENTICITY WITH CONSUMERS. IF CERTAIN ENDORSERS WERE TO STOP USING OUR

PRODUCTS CONTRARY TO THEIR ENDORSEMENT AGREEMENTS, OUR BUSINESS COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED. IN ADDITION, ACTIONS TAKEN BY ATHLETES, TEAMS OR LEAGUES ASSOCIATED WITH OUR PRODUCTS THAT HARM THE REPUTATIONS OF THOSE ATHLETES, TEAMS OR LEAGUES COULD

ALSO HARM OUR BRAND IMAGE WITH CONSUMERS AND, AS A RESULT, COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR SALES AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. IN ADDITION, POOR PERFORMANCE BY OUR ENDORSERS, A FAILURE TO CONTINUE TO CORRECTLY IDENTIFY PROMISING ATHLETES TO USE AND

ENDORSE OUR PRODUCTS, OR A FAILURE TO ENTER INTO COST EFFECTIVE ENDORSEMENT ARRANGEMENTS WITH PROMINENT ATHLETES AND SPORTS ORGANIZATIONS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BRAND AND RESULT IN DECREASED SALES OF OUR PRODUCTS.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

FAILURE OF OUR CONTRACTORS OR OUR LICENSEES CONTRACTORS TO COMPLY WITH OUR CODE OF CONDUCT,

LOCAL LAWS, AND OTHER STANDARDS COULD HARM OUR BUSINESS.

WE CONTRACT WITH HUNDREDS OF CONTRACTORS OUTSIDE OF THE

UNITED STATES TO MANUFACTURE OUR PRODUCTS, AND WE ALSO HAVE LICENSE AGREEMENTS THAT PERMIT UNAFFILIATED PARTIES TO MANUFACTURE OR CONTRACT TO MANUFACTURE PRODUCTS USING OUR TRADEMARKS. WE IMPOSE, AND REQUIRE OUR LICENSEES TO IMPOSE, ON THOSE

CONTRACTORS A CODE OF CONDUCT AND OTHER ENVIRONMENTAL, HEALTH, AND SAFETY STANDARDS FOR THE BENEFIT OF WORKERS. WE ALSO REQUIRE THESE CONTRACTORS TO COMPLY WITH APPLICABLE STANDARDS FOR PRODUCT SAFETY. HOWEVER, FROM TIME TO TIME CONTRACTORS MAY NOT

COMPLY WITH SUCH STANDARDS OR APPLICABLE LOCAL LAW OR OUR LICENSEES MAY NOT REQUIRE THEIR CONTRACTORS TO COMPLY WITH SUCH STANDARDS OR APPLICABLE LOCAL LAW. SIGNIFICANT OR CONTINUING NONCOMPLIANCE WITH SUCH STANDARDS AND LAWS BY ONE OR MORE

CONTRACTORS COULD HARM OUR REPUTATION OR RESULT IN A PRODUCT RECALL AND, AS A RESULT, COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR SALES AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

GLOBAL CAPITAL AND CREDIT MARKET CONDITIONS, AND RESULTING DECLINES IN CONSUMER CONFIDENCE AND SPENDING, COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, OPERATING RESULTS, AND FINANCIAL

CONDITION.

CONTINUING VOLATILITY AND DISRUPTION IN THE GLOBAL CAPITAL AND CREDIT MARKETS HAVE LED TO A TIGHTENING OF

BUSINESS CREDIT AND LIQUIDITY, A CONTRACTION OF CONSUMER CREDIT, BUSINESS FAILURES, HIGHER UNEMPLOYMENT, AND DECLINES IN CONSUMER CONFIDENCE AND SPENDING IN THE UNITED STATES AND INTERNATIONALLY. IF GLOBAL ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL MARKET

CONDITIONS DETERIORATE OR REMAIN WEAK FOR AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF TIME, THE FOLLOWING FACTORS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, OPERATING RESULTS, AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.



SLOWER CONSUMER SPENDING MAY RESULT IN REDUCED DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS, REDUCED ORDERS FROM RETAILERS FOR OUR PRODUCTS, ORDER CANCELLATIONS, LOWER

REVENUES, INCREASED INVENTORIES, AND LOWER GROSS MARGINS.



WE MAY BE UNABLE TO FIND SUITABLE INVESTMENTS THAT ARE SAFE, LIQUID, AND PROVIDE A REASONABLE RETURN. THIS COULD RESULT IN LOWER INTEREST

INCOME OR LONGER INVESTMENT HORIZONS. DISRUPTIONS TO CAPITAL MARKETS OR THE BANKING SYSTEM MAY ALSO IMPAIR THE VALUE OF INVESTMENTS OR BANK DEPOSITS WE CURRENTLY CONSIDER SAFE OR LIQUID.



WE MAY BE UNABLE TO ACCESS FINANCING IN THE CREDIT AND CAPITAL MARKETS AT REASONABLE RATES IN THE EVENT WE FIND IT DESIRABLE TO DO SO.



THE FAILURE OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTION COUNTERPARTIES TO HONOR THEIR OBLIGATIONS TO US UNDER CREDIT AND DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS COULD JEOPARDIZE OUR

ABILITY TO RELY ON AND BENEFIT FROM THOSE INSTRUMENTS. OUR ABILITY TO REPLACE THOSE INSTRUMENTS ON THE SAME OR SIMILAR TERMS MAY BE LIMITED UNDER POOR MARKET CONDITIONS.



WE CONDUCT TRANSACTIONS IN VARIOUS CURRENCIES, WHICH INCREASE OUR EXPOSURE TO FLUCTUATIONS IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES RELATIVE TO THE U.S.

DOLLAR. CONTINUED VOLATILITY IN THE MARKETS AND EXCHANGE RATES FOR FOREIGN CURRENCIES AND CONTRACTS IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES COULD HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON OUR REPORTED FINANCIAL RESULTS AND CONDITION.



CONTINUED VOLATILITY IN THE MARKETS AND PRICES FOR COMMODITIES AND RAW MATERIALS WE USE IN OUR PRODUCTS AND IN OUR SUPPLY CHAIN (SUCH AS PETROLEUM)

COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR COSTS, GROSS MARGINS, AND PROFITABILITY.



IF RETAILERS OF OUR PRODUCTS EXPERIENCE DECLINING REVENUES, OR RETAILERS EXPERIENCE DIFFICULTY OBTAINING FINANCING IN THE CAPITAL AND CREDIT MARKETS TO

PURCHASE OUR PRODUCTS, THIS COULD RESULT IN REDUCED ORDERS FOR OUR PRODUCTS, ORDER CANCELLATIONS, INABILITY OF RETAILERS TO TIMELY MEET THEIR PAYMENT OBLIGATIONS TO US, EXTENDED PAYMENT TERMS, HIGHER ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, REDUCED CASH FLOWS, GREATER

EXPENSE ASSOCIATED WITH COLLECTION EFFORTS, AND INCREASED BAD DEBT EXPENSE.



IF RETAILERS OF OUR PRODUCTS EXPERIENCE SEVERE FINANCIAL DIFFICULTY, SOME MAY BECOME INSOLVENT AND CEASE BUSINESS OPERATIONS, WHICH COULD REDUCE THE

AVAILABILITY OF OUR PRODUCTS TO CONSUMERS.



IF CONTRACT MANUFACTURERS OF OUR PRODUCTS OR OTHER PARTICIPANTS IN OUR SUPPLY CHAIN EXPERIENCE DIFFICULTY OBTAINING FINANCING IN THE CAPITAL AND CREDIT

MARKETS TO PURCHASE RAW MATERIALS OR TO FINANCE GENERAL WORKING CAPITAL NEEDS, IT MAY RESULT IN DELAYS OR NON-DELIVERY OF SHIPMENTS OF OUR PRODUCTS.

OUR BUSINESS IS AFFECTED BY SEASONALITY, WHICH COULD RESULT IN FLUCTUATIONS IN OUR OPERATING RESULTS AND STOCK PRICE.

WE EXPERIENCE MODERATE FLUCTUATIONS IN AGGREGATE SALES VOLUME DURING THE YEAR. HISTORICALLY, REVENUES IN THE FIRST AND FOURTH FISCAL QUARTERS HAVE SLIGHTLY EXCEEDED THOSE IN THE SECOND AND THIRD FISCAL

QUARTERS. HOWEVER, THE MIX OF PRODUCT SALES MAY VARY CONSIDERABLY FROM TIME TO TIME AS A RESULT OF CHANGES IN SEASONAL AND GEOGRAPHIC DEMAND FOR PARTICULAR TYPES OF FOOTWEAR, APPAREL AND EQUIPMENT. IN ADDITION, OUR CUSTOMERS MAY CANCEL ORDERS,

CHANGE DELIVERY SCHEDULES OR CHANGE THE MIX OF PRODUCTS ORDERED WITH MINIMAL NOTICE. AS A RESULT, WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO ACCURATELY PREDICT OUR QUARTERLY SALES. ACCORDINGLY, OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS ARE LIKELY TO FLUCTUATE SIGNIFICANTLY FROM PERIOD

TO PERIOD. THIS SEASONALITY, ALONG WITH OTHER FACTORS THAT ARE BEYOND OUR CONTROL, INCLUDING GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, CHANGES IN CONSUMER PREFERENCES, WEATHER CONDITIONS, AVAILABILITY OF IMPORT QUOTAS AND CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE FLUCTUATIONS,

COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS AND CAUSE OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS TO FLUCTUATE. OUR OPERATING MARGINS ARE ALSO SENSITIVE TO A NUMBER OF FACTORS THAT ARE BEYOND OUR CONTROL, INCLUDING MANUFACTURING AND TRANSPORTATION COSTS, SHIFTS IN PRODUCT

SALES MIX, GEOGRAPHIC SALES TRENDS, AND CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE FLUCTUATIONS, ALL OF WHICH WE EXPECT TO CONTINUE. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN ANY PERIOD SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED INDICATIVE OF THE RESULTS TO BE EXPECTED FOR ANY FUTURE PERIOD.

FUTURES ORDERS MAY NOT BE AN ACCURATE INDICATION OF OUR FUTURE REVENUES.

WE MAKE SUBSTANTIAL USE OF OUR FUTURES ORDERING PROGRAM, WHICH ALLOWS RETAILERS TO ORDER FIVE TO SIX MONTHS IN ADVANCE OF

DELIVERY WITH THE COMMITMENT THAT THEIR ORDERS WILL BE DELIVERED WITHIN A SET PERIOD OF TIME AT A FIXED PRICE. OUR FUTURES ORDERING PROGRAM ALLOWS US TO MINIMIZE THE AMOUNT OF PRODUCTS WE HOLD IN INVENTORY, PURCHASING COSTS, THE TIME NECESSARY TO

FILL CUSTOMER ORDERS, AND THE RISK OF NON-DELIVERY. WE REPORT CHANGES IN FUTURES ORDERS IN OUR PERIODIC FINANCIAL REPORTS. ALTHOUGH WE BELIEVE FUTURES ORDERS ARE AN IMPORTANT INDICATOR OF OUR FUTURE REVENUES, REPORTED FUTURES ORDERS ARE NOT

NECESSARILY INDICATIVE OF OUR EXPECTATION OF CHANGES IN REVENUES FOR ANY FUTURE PERIOD. THIS IS BECAUSE THE MIX OF ORDERS CAN SHIFT BETWEEN ADVANCE/FUTURES AND AT-ONCE ORDERS. IN ADDITION, FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE FLUCTUATIONS, ORDER

CANCELLATIONS, RETURNS, AND DISCOUNTS CAN CAUSE DIFFERENCES IN THE COMPARISONS BETWEEN FUTURES ORDERS AND ACTUAL REVENUES. MOREOVER, A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR REVENUE IS NOT DERIVED FROM FUTURES AND ADVANCE ORDERS, INCLUDING AT-ONCE AND CLOSE-OUT

SALES OF NIKE BRAND FOOTWEAR AND APPAREL, SALES OF NIKE BRAND EQUIPMENT, SALES FROM OUR DIRECT TO CONSUMER OPERATIONS, AND SALES FROM OUR OTHER BUSINESSES.

OUR FUTURES ORDERING PROGRAM DOES NOT PREVENT EXCESS INVENTORIES OR INVENTORY SHORTAGES, WHICH COULD RESULT IN DECREASED OPERATING MARGINS AND HARM TO OUR BUSINESS.

WE PURCHASE PRODUCTS FROM MANUFACTURERS OUTSIDE OF OUR FUTURES ORDERING PROGRAM AND IN ADVANCE OF CUSTOMER ORDERS, WHICH WE HOLD IN

INVENTORY AND RESELL TO CUSTOMERS. THERE IS A RISK WE MAY BE UNABLE TO SELL EXCESS PRODUCTS ORDERED FROM MANUFACTURERS. INVENTORY LEVELS IN EXCESS OF CUSTOMER DEMAND MAY RESULT IN INVENTORY WRITE-DOWNS, AND THE SALE OF EXCESS INVENTORY AT DISCOUNTED

PRICES COULD SIGNIFICANTLY IMPAIR OUR BRAND IMAGE AND HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR OPERATING RESULTS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. CONVERSELY, IF WE UNDERESTIMATE CONSUMER DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS OR IF OUR MANUFACTURERS FAIL TO SUPPLY PRODUCTS WE

REQUIRE AT THE TIME WE NEED THEM, WE MAY EXPERIENCE INVENTORY SHORTAGES. INVENTORY SHORTAGES MIGHT DELAY SHIPMENTS TO CUSTOMERS, NEGATIVELY IMPACT RETAILER AND DISTRIBUTOR RELATIONSHIPS, AND DIMINISH BRAND LOYALTY.

THE DIFFICULTY IN FORECASTING DEMAND ALSO MAKES IT DIFFICULT TO ESTIMATE OUR FUTURE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION FROM

PERIOD TO PERIOD. A FAILURE TO ACCURATELY PREDICT THE LEVEL OF DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR NET REVENUES AND NET INCOME, AND WE ARE UNLIKELY TO FORECAST SUCH EFFECTS WITH ANY CERTAINTY IN ADVANCE.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

WE MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY THE FINANCIAL HEALTH OF OUR RETAILERS.

WE EXTEND CREDIT TO OUR CUSTOMERS BASED ON AN ASSESSMENT OF A CUSTOMERS FINANCIAL CONDITION, GENERALLY WITHOUT REQUIRING COLLATERAL.

TO ASSIST IN THE SCHEDULING OF PRODUCTION AND THE SHIPPING OF SEASONAL PRODUCTS, WE OFFER CUSTOMERS THE ABILITY TO PLACE ORDERS FIVE TO SIX MONTHS AHEAD OF DELIVERY UNDER OUR FUTURES ORDERING PROGRAM. THESE ADVANCE ORDERS MAY BE

CANCELLED, AND THE RISK OF CANCELLATION MAY INCREASE WHEN DEALING WITH FINANCIALLY AILING RETAILERS OR RETAILERS STRUGGLING WITH ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTY. IN THE PAST, SOME CUSTOMERS HAVE EXPERIENCED FINANCIAL DIFFICULTIES, WHICH HAVE HAD AN ADVERSE

EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS. AS A RESULT, RETAILERS MAY BE MORE CAUTIOUS THAN USUAL WITH ORDERS AS A RESULT OF WEAKNESS IN THE RETAIL ECONOMY. A SLOWING ECONOMY IN OUR KEY MARKETS COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE FINANCIAL HEALTH OF OUR CUSTOMERS,

WHICH IN TURN COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. IN ADDITION, PRODUCT SALES ARE DEPENDENT IN PART ON HIGH QUALITY MERCHANDISING AND AN APPEALING STORE ENVIRONMENT TO ATTRACT CONSUMERS, WHICH REQUIRES

CONTINUING INVESTMENTS BY RETAILERS. RETAILERS WHO EXPERIENCE FINANCIAL DIFFICULTIES MAY FAIL TO MAKE SUCH INVESTMENTS OR DELAY THEM, RESULTING IN LOWER SALES AND ORDERS FOR OUR PRODUCTS.

CONSOLIDATION OF RETAILERS OR CONCENTRATION OF RETAIL MARKET SHARE AMONG A FEW RETAILERS MAY INCREASE AND CONCENTRATE OUR CREDIT RISK, AND IMPAIR OUR ABILITY TO SELL OUR PRODUCTS.

THE ATHLETIC FOOTWEAR, APPAREL, AND EQUIPMENT RETAIL MARKETS IN SOME COUNTRIES ARE DOMINATED BY A FEW LARGE ATHLETIC

FOOTWEAR, APPAREL, AND EQUIPMENT RETAILERS WITH MANY STORES. THESE RETAILERS HAVE IN THE PAST INCREASED THEIR MARKET SHARE AND MAY CONTINUE TO DO SO IN THE FUTURE BY EXPANDING THROUGH ACQUISITIONS AND CONSTRUCTION OF ADDITIONAL STORES. THESE

SITUATIONS CONCENTRATE OUR CREDIT RISK WITH A RELATIVELY SMALL NUMBER OF RETAILERS, AND, IF ANY OF THESE RETAILERS WERE TO EXPERIENCE A SHORTAGE OF LIQUIDITY, IT WOULD INCREASE THE RISK THAT THEIR OUTSTANDING PAYABLES TO US MAY NOT BE PAID. IN

ADDITION, INCREASING MARKET SHARE CONCENTRATION AMONG ONE OR A FEW RETAILERS IN A PARTICULAR COUNTRY OR REGION INCREASES THE RISK THAT IF ANY ONE OF THEM SUBSTANTIALLY REDUCES THEIR PURCHASES OF OUR PRODUCTS, WE MAY BE UNABLE TO FIND A SUFFICIENT

NUMBER OF OTHER RETAIL OUTLETS FOR OUR PRODUCTS TO SUSTAIN THE SAME LEVEL OF SALES AND REVENUES.

FAILURE TO ADEQUATELY PROTECT OUR

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS.

WE UTILIZE TRADEMARKS ON NEARLY

ALL OF OUR PRODUCTS AND BELIEVE THAT HAVING DISTINCTIVE MARKS THAT ARE READILY IDENTIFIABLE IS AN IMPORTANT FACTOR IN CREATING A MARKET FOR OUR GOODS, IN IDENTIFYING US, AND IN DISTINGUISHING OUR GOODS FROM THE GOODS OF OTHERS. WE CONSIDER OUR NIKE

®

AND SWOOSH DESIGN

®

TRADEMARKS TO BE AMONG OUR MOST VALUABLE ASSETS AND WE HAVE REGISTERED THESE TRADEMARKS IN OVER 150 COUNTRIES. IN ADDITION, WE OWN MANY OTHER TRADEMARKS THAT WE

UTILIZE IN MARKETING OUR PRODUCTS. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR TRADEMARKS, PATENTS, AND OTHER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS ARE IMPORTANT TO OUR BRAND, OUR SUCCESS, AND OUR COMPETITIVE POSITION. WE PERIODICALLY DISCOVER PRODUCTS THAT ARE COUNTERFEIT

REPRODUCTIONS OF OUR PRODUCTS OR THAT OTHERWISE INFRINGE ON OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS. IF WE ARE UNSUCCESSFUL IN CHALLENGING A PARTYS PRODUCTS ON THE BASIS OF TRADEMARK OR DESIGN OR UTILITY PATENT INFRINGEMENT, CONTINUED SALES OF THESE

PRODUCTS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR SALES AND OUR BRAND AND RESULT IN THE SHIFT OF CONSUMER PREFERENCE AWAY FROM OUR PRODUCTS. THE ACTIONS WE TAKE TO ESTABLISH AND PROTECT TRADEMARKS, PATENTS, AND OTHER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS MAY NOT BE

ADEQUATE TO PREVENT IMITATION OF OUR PRODUCTS BY OTHERS OR TO PREVENT OTHERS FROM SEEKING TO BLOCK SALES OF OUR PRODUCTS AS VIOLATIONS OF PROPRIETARY RIGHTS.

IN ADDITION, THE LAWS OF CERTAIN FOREIGN COUNTRIES MAY NOT PROTECT INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS TO THE SAME EXTENT AS THE LAWS OF THE UNITED STATES. WE MAY FACE SIGNIFICANT EXPENSES AND LIABILITY IN

CONNECTION WITH THE PROTECTION OF OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES, AND IF WE ARE UNABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY PROTECT OUR RIGHTS OR RESOLVE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY CONFLICTS WITH OTHERS, OUR BUSINESS OR FINANCIAL CONDITION MAY BE

ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

WE ARE SUBJECT TO PERIODIC LITIGATION AND OTHER REGULATORY PROCEEDINGS, WHICH COULD RESULT IN UNEXPECTED EXPENSE OF

TIME AND RESOURCES.

FROM TIME TO TIME WE ARE CALLED UPON TO DEFEND OURSELVES AGAINST LAWSUITS AND REGULATORY ACTIONS

RELATING TO OUR BUSINESS. DUE TO THE INHERENT UNCERTAINTIES OF LITIGATION AND REGULATORY PROCEEDINGS, WE CANNOT ACCURATELY

14

TABLE OF CONTENTS

PREDICT THE ULTIMATE OUTCOME OF ANY SUCH PROCEEDINGS. AN UNFAVORABLE OUTCOME COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. IN ADDITION, ANY

SIGNIFICANT LITIGATION IN THE FUTURE, REGARDLESS OF ITS MERITS, COULD DIVERT MANAGEMENTS ATTENTION FROM OUR OPERATIONS AND RESULT IN SUBSTANTIAL LEGAL FEES.

OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS INVOLVE INHERENT RISKS WHICH COULD RESULT IN HARM TO OUR BUSINESS.

VIRTUALLY ALL OF OUR ATHLETIC FOOTWEAR AND APPAREL IS MANUFACTURED OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES, AND THE MAJORITY OF OUR PRODUCTS ARE SOLD OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES. ACCORDINGLY, WE ARE SUBJECT TO THE

RISKS GENERALLY ASSOCIATED WITH GLOBAL TRADE AND DOING BUSINESS ABROAD, WHICH INCLUDE FOREIGN LAWS AND REGULATIONS, VARYING CONSUMER PREFERENCES ACROSS GEOGRAPHIC REGIONS, POLITICAL UNREST, DISRUPTIONS OR DELAYS IN CROSS-BORDER SHIPMENTS, AND

CHANGES IN ECONOMIC CONDITIONS IN COUNTRIES IN WHICH WE MANUFACTURE OR SELL PRODUCTS. IN ADDITION, DISEASE OUTBREAKS, TERRORIST ACTS AND MILITARY CONFLICT HAVE INCREASED THE RISKS OF DOING BUSINESS ABROAD. THESE FACTORS, AMONG OTHERS, COULD AFFECT

OUR ABILITY TO MANUFACTURE PRODUCTS OR PROCURE MATERIALS, OUR ABILITY TO IMPORT PRODUCTS, OUR ABILITY TO SELL PRODUCTS IN INTERNATIONAL MARKETS, AND OUR COST OF DOING BUSINESS. IF ANY OF THESE OR OTHER FACTORS MAKE THE CONDUCT OF BUSINESS IN A

PARTICULAR COUNTRY UNDESIRABLE OR IMPRACTICAL, OUR BUSINESS COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED. IN ADDITION, MANY OF OUR IMPORTED PRODUCTS ARE SUBJECT TO DUTIES, TARIFFS, OR QUOTAS THAT AFFECT THE COST AND QUANTITY OF VARIOUS TYPES OF GOODS IMPORTED INTO

THE UNITED STATES AND OTHER COUNTRIES. ANY COUNTRY IN WHICH OUR PRODUCTS ARE PRODUCED OR SOLD MAY ELIMINATE, ADJUST OR IMPOSE NEW QUOTAS, DUTIES, TARIFFS, SAFEGUARD MEASURES, ANTI-DUMPING DUTIES, CARGO RESTRICTIONS TO PREVENT TERRORISM, RESTRICTIONS

ON THE TRANSFER OF CURRENCY, CLIMATE CHANGE LEGISLATION, PRODUCT SAFETY REGULATIONS OR OTHER CHARGES OR RESTRICTIONS, ANY OF WHICH COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

CHANGES IN TAX LAWS AND UNANTICIPATED TAX LIABILITIES COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE AND PROFITABILITY.

WE ARE SUBJECT TO INCOME TAXES IN THE UNITED STATES AND NUMEROUS FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS. OUR EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE IN THE FUTURE COULD

BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING: CHANGES IN THE MIX OF EARNINGS IN COUNTRIES WITH DIFFERING STATUTORY TAX RATES, CHANGES IN THE VALUATION OF DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, CHANGES IN TAX LAWS, THE OUTCOME OF INCOME TAX

AUDITS IN VARIOUS JURISDICTIONS AROUND THE WORLD, AND ANY REPATRIATION OF NON-US EARNINGS FOR WHICH WE HAVE NOT PREVIOUSLY PROVIDED FOR U.S. TAXES. WE REGULARLY ASSESS ALL OF THESE MATTERS TO DETERMINE THE ADEQUACY OF OUR TAX PROVISION, WHICH IS

SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT DISCRETION.

CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE FLUCTUATIONS COULD RESULT IN HIGHER COSTS AND DECREASED MARGINS AND EARNINGS.

A MAJORITY OF OUR PRODUCTS ARE SOLD OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES. AS A RESULT, WE CONDUCT TRANSACTIONS IN VARIOUS

CURRENCIES, WHICH INCREASE OUR EXPOSURE TO FLUCTUATIONS IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES RELATIVE TO THE U.S. DOLLAR. OUR INTERNATIONAL REVENUES AND EXPENSES GENERALLY ARE DERIVED FROM SALES AND OPERATIONS IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES, AND THESE REVENUES

AND EXPENSES COULD BE AFFECTED BY CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS, INCLUDING AMOUNTS RECORDED IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES AND TRANSLATED INTO U.S. DOLLARS FOR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL REPORTING. CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE FLUCTUATIONS COULD ALSO DISRUPT THE BUSINESS OF

THE INDEPENDENT MANUFACTURERS THAT PRODUCE OUR PRODUCTS BY MAKING THEIR PURCHASES OF RAW MATERIALS MORE EXPENSIVE AND MORE DIFFICULT TO FINANCE. FOREIGN CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL

CONDITION.

OUR HEDGING ACTIVITIES (SEE NOTE 17  RISK MANAGEMENT AND DERIVATIVES IN THE ACCOMPANYING NOTES TO THE

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

),

WHICH ARE DESIGNED TO MINIMIZE AND DELAY, BUT NOT TO COMPLETELY ELIMINATE, THE EFFECTS OF FOREIGN CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS MAY NOT SUFFICIENTLY MITIGATE THE IMPACT OF FOREIGN CURRENCIES ON OUR FINANCIAL

RESULTS. FACTORS THAT COULD AFFECT THE EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR HEDGING ACTIVITIES INCLUDE ACCURACY OF SALES FORECASTS, VOLATILITY OF CURRENCY MARKETS, AND THE AVAILABILITY OF HEDGING INSTRUMENTS. SINCE THE HEDGING ACTIVITIES ARE DESIGNED TO MINIMIZE

VOLATILITY, THEY NOT ONLY REDUCE THE NEGATIVE IMPACT OF A STRONGER U.S. DOLLAR, BUT THEY

15

TABLE OF CONTENTS

ALSO REDUCE THE POSITIVE IMPACT OF A WEAKER U.S. DOLLAR. OUR FUTURE FINANCIAL RESULTS COULD BE SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTED BY THE VALUE OF THE U.S. DOLLAR IN RELATION TO THE FOREIGN CURRENCIES IN

WHICH WE CONDUCT BUSINESS. THE DEGREE TO WHICH OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS ARE AFFECTED FOR ANY GIVEN TIME PERIOD WILL DEPEND IN PART UPON OUR HEDGING ACTIVITIES.

OUR PRODUCTS ARE SUBJECT TO RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH OVERSEAS SOURCING, MANUFACTURING, AND FINANCING.

THE PRINCIPAL MATERIALS USED IN OUR APPAREL PRODUCTS  NATURAL AND SYNTHETIC FABRICS AND THREADS, PLASTIC AND METAL HARDWARE, AND SPECIALIZED PERFORMANCE FABRICS DESIGNED TO REPEL RAIN, RETAIN HEAT,

OR EFFICIENTLY TRANSPORT BODY MOISTURE  ARE AVAILABLE IN COUNTRIES WHERE OUR MANUFACTURING TAKES PLACE. THE PRINCIPAL MATERIALS USED IN OUR FOOTWEAR PRODUCTS  NATURAL AND SYNTHETIC RUBBER, PLASTIC COMPOUNDS, FOAM CUSHIONING MATERIALS,

NYLON, LEATHER, CANVAS AND POLYURETHANE FILMS  ARE ALSO LOCALLY AVAILABLE TO MANUFACTURERS. NIKE CONTRACTORS AND SUPPLIERS BUY RAW MATERIALS IN BULK.

THERE COULD BE A SIGNIFICANT DISRUPTION IN THE SUPPLY OF FABRICS OR RAW MATERIALS FROM CURRENT SOURCES OR, IN THE EVENT OF A DISRUPTION, WE MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO LOCATE ALTERNATIVE SUPPLIERS OF MATERIALS

OF COMPARABLE QUALITY AT AN ACCEPTABLE PRICE, OR AT ALL. IN ADDITION, WE CANNOT BE CERTAIN THAT OUR UNAFFILIATED MANUFACTURERS WILL BE ABLE TO FILL OUR ORDERS IN A TIMELY MANNER. IF WE EXPERIENCE SIGNIFICANT INCREASES IN DEMAND, OR NEED TO REPLACE

AN EXISTING MANUFACTURER, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT ADDITIONAL SUPPLIES OF FABRICS OR RAW MATERIALS OR ADDITIONAL MANUFACTURING CAPACITY WILL BE AVAILABLE WHEN REQUIRED ON TERMS THAT ARE ACCEPTABLE TO US, OR AT ALL, OR THAT ANY SUPPLIER OR

MANUFACTURER WOULD ALLOCATE SUFFICIENT CAPACITY TO US IN ORDER TO MEET OUR REQUIREMENTS. IN ADDITION, EVEN IF WE ARE ABLE TO EXPAND EXISTING OR FIND NEW MANUFACTURING OR SOURCES OF MATERIALS, WE MAY ENCOUNTER DELAYS IN PRODUCTION AND ADDED COSTS AS

A RESULT OF THE TIME IT TAKES TO TRAIN SUPPLIERS AND MANUFACTURERS IN OUR METHODS, PRODUCTS, QUALITY CONTROL STANDARDS, AND LABOR, HEALTH AND SAFETY STANDARDS. ANY DELAYS, INTERRUPTION OR INCREASED COSTS IN THE SUPPLY OF MATERIALS OR MANUFACTURE OF

OUR PRODUCTS COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR ABILITY TO MEET RETAIL CUSTOMER AND CONSUMER DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS AND RESULT IN LOWER REVENUES AND NET INCOME BOTH IN THE SHORT AND LONG-TERM.

BECAUSE INDEPENDENT MANUFACTURERS MANUFACTURE A MAJORITY OF OUR PRODUCTS OUTSIDE OF OUR PRINCIPAL SALES MARKETS, OUR PRODUCTS MUST BE

TRANSPORTED BY THIRD PARTIES OVER LARGE GEOGRAPHIC DISTANCES. DELAYS IN THE SHIPMENT OR DELIVERY OF OUR PRODUCTS DUE TO THE AVAILABILITY OF TRANSPORTATION, WORK STOPPAGES, PORT STRIKES, INFRASTRUCTURE CONGESTION, OR OTHER FACTORS, AND COSTS AND

DELAYS ASSOCIATED WITH CONSOLIDATING OR TRANSITIONING BETWEEN MANUFACTURERS, COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE. IN ADDITION, MANUFACTURING DELAYS OR UNEXPECTED DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS MAY REQUIRE US TO USE FASTER, BUT MORE EXPENSIVE,

TRANSPORTATION METHODS SUCH AS AIRCRAFT, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR PROFIT MARGINS. THE COST OF FUEL IS A SIGNIFICANT COMPONENT IN MANUFACTURING AND TRANSPORTATION COSTS, SO INCREASES IN THE PRICE OF PETROLEUM PRODUCTS CAN ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR

PROFIT MARGINS.

IN ADDITION, SOJITZ AMERICA PERFORMS SIGNIFICANT IMPORT-EXPORT FINANCING SERVICES FOR MOST OF THE NIKE BRAND

PRODUCTS SOLD OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES, EUROPE, MIDDLE EAST, AFRICA, AND JAPAN, EXCLUDING PRODUCTS PRODUCED AND SOLD IN THE SAME COUNTRY. ANY FAILURE OF SOJITZ AMERICA TO PROVIDE THESE SERVICES OR ANY FAILURE OF SOJITZ AMERICAS BANKS COULD

DISRUPT OUR ABILITY TO ACQUIRE PRODUCTS FROM OUR SUPPLIERS AND TO DELIVER PRODUCTS TO OUR CUSTOMERS OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES, EUROPE, MIDDLE EAST, AFRICA, AND JAPAN. SUCH A DISRUPTION COULD RESULT IN CANCELLED ORDERS THAT WOULD ADVERSELY AFFECT

SALES AND PROFITABILITY.

NATURAL DISASTERS COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR OPERATING RESULTS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. THE

MARCH 11, 2011 JAPANESE EARTHQUAKE AND RESULTING TSUNAMI NEGATIVELY AFFECTED OUR JAPANESE REVENUE AND PROFITS FOR THE FOURTH QUARTER ENDED MAY 31, 2011, AND WE EXPECT THOSE EVENTS TO CONTINUE TO ADVERSELY AFFECT US DURING FISCAL YEAR 2012.

NATURAL DISASTERS SUCH AS EARTHQUAKES, HURRICANES, TSUNAMIS OR OTHER ADVERSE WEATHER AND CLIMATE CONDITIONS, WHETHER

OCCURRING IN THE U.S. OR ABROAD, AND THE CONSEQUENCES AND EFFECTS THEREOF, INCLUDING ENERGY SHORTAGES AND PUBLIC HEALTH ISSUES, COULD DISRUPT OUR OPERATIONS, OR THE OPERATIONS OF OUR VENDORS AND OTHER SUPPLIERS, OR RESULT IN ECONOMIC INSTABILITY

THAT MAY NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR OPERATING RESULTS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

16

TABLE OF CONTENTS

ON MARCH 11, 2011, JAPAN EXPERIENCED A SIGNIFICANT EARTHQUAKE AND RESULTING

TSUNAMI. THE IMPLICATIONS FROM ONGOING EVENTS AND WIDESPREAD DAMAGE TO THE NATIONS INFRASTRUCTURE, CONSUMER CONFIDENCE AND OVERALL ECONOMY REMAIN UNCLEAR. OUR REVENUES AND PROFITS FOR OUR JAPAN BUSINESSES WERE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED

DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF FISCAL YEAR 2011, AND ALTHOUGH WE CANNOT FULLY ASSESS THE FUTURE FINANCIAL IMPACT OF THESE ONGOING EVENTS, WE DO EXPECT OUR JAPANESE BUSINESSES TO CONTINUE TO BE ADVERSELY IMPACTED THROUGHOUT FISCAL 2012.

OUR SUCCESS DEPENDS ON OUR GLOBAL DISTRIBUTION FACILITIES.

WE DISTRIBUTE OUR PRODUCTS TO CUSTOMERS DIRECTLY FROM THE FACTORY AND THROUGH DISTRIBUTION CENTERS LOCATED THROUGHOUT THE WORLD. OUR ABILITY TO MEET CUSTOMER EXPECTATIONS, MANAGE INVENTORY, COMPLETE SALES

AND ACHIEVE OBJECTIVES FOR OPERATING EFFICIENCIES DEPENDS ON THE PROPER OPERATION OF OUR DISTRIBUTION FACILITIES, THE DEVELOPMENT OR EXPANSION OF ADDITIONAL DISTRIBUTION CAPABILITIES, AND THE TIMELY PERFORMANCE OF SERVICES BY THIRD PARTIES

(INCLUDING THOSE INVOLVED IN SHIPPING PRODUCT TO AND FROM OUR DISTRIBUTION FACILITIES). OUR DISTRIBUTION FACILITIES COULD BE INTERRUPTED BY INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY PROBLEMS AND DISASTERS SUCH AS EARTHQUAKES OR FIRES. ANY SIGNIFICANT FAILURE IN OUR

DISTRIBUTION FACILITIES COULD RESULT IN AN ADVERSE AFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS. WE MAINTAIN BUSINESS INTERRUPTION INSURANCE, BUT IT MAY NOT ADEQUATELY PROTECT US FROM ADVERSE EFFECTS THAT COULD BE CAUSED BY SIGNIFICANT DISRUPTIONS IN OUR DISTRIBUTION

FACILITIES.

WE RELY SIGNIFICANTLY ON INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY TO OPERATE OUR BUSINESS, INCLUDING OUR SUPPLY CHAIN AND RETAIL OPERATIONS,

AND ANY FAILURE, INADEQUACY, INTERRUPTION OR SECURITY FAILURE OF THAT TECHNOLOGY COULD HARM OUR REPUTATION OR OUR ABILITY TO EFFECTIVELY OPERATE OUR BUSINESS.

WE ARE HEAVILY DEPENDENT ON INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS ACROSS OUR SUPPLY CHAIN, INCLUDING PRODUCT DESIGN, PRODUCTION, FORECASTING, ORDERING, MANUFACTURING, TRANSPORTATION, SALES, AND DISTRIBUTION. OUR

ABILITY TO EFFECTIVELY MANAGE AND MAINTAIN OUR INVENTORY AND TO SHIP PRODUCTS TO CUSTOMERS ON A TIMELY BASIS DEPENDS SIGNIFICANTLY ON THE RELIABILITY OF THESE SUPPLY CHAIN SYSTEMS. OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS, AS PART OF THE ONGOING INITIATIVE TO

UPGRADE OUR WORLDWIDE SUPPLY CHAIN, WE HAVE IMPLEMENTED NEW SYSTEMS IN ALL OF OUR GEOGRAPHICAL REGIONS IN WHICH WE OPERATE. OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS, WE WILL WORK TO CONTINUE TO ENHANCE THE SYSTEMS AND RELATED PROCESSES IN OUR GLOBAL OPERATIONS. THE

FAILURE OF THESE SYSTEMS TO OPERATE EFFECTIVELY, PROBLEMS WITH TRANSITIONING TO UPGRADED OR REPLACEMENT SYSTEMS, OR A BREACH IN SECURITY OF THESE SYSTEMS COULD CAUSE DELAYS IN PRODUCT FULFILLMENT AND REDUCED EFFICIENCY OF OUR OPERATIONS, COULD

REQUIRE SIGNIFICANT CAPITAL INVESTMENTS TO REMEDIATE THE PROBLEM, AND MAY HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

HACKERS AND DATA THIEVES ARE INCREASINGLY SOPHISTICATED AND OPERATE LARGE SCALE AND COMPLEX AUTOMATED ATTACKS. ANY BREACH OF OUR NETWORK MAY RESULT IN THE LOSS OF VALUABLE BUSINESS DATA, OUR

CUSTOMERS OR EMPLOYEES PERSONAL INFORMATION OR A DISRUPTION OF OUR BUSINESS, WHICH COULD GIVE RISE TO UNWANTED MEDIA ATTENTION, DAMAGE OUR CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIPS AND REPUTATION AND RESULT IN LOST SALES, FINES OR LAWSUITS. IN ADDITION, WE

MUST COMPLY WITH INCREASINGLY COMPLEX REGULATORY STANDARDS ENACTED TO PROTECT THIS BUSINESS AND PERSONAL DATA. AN INABILITY TO MAINTAIN COMPLIANCE WITH THESE REGULATORY STANDARDS COULD SUBJECT US TO LEGAL RISKS.

OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED IF SUBSTANTIAL INVESTMENTS IN BUSINESSES AND OPERATIONS FAIL TO PRODUCE EXPECTED RETURNS.

FROM TIME TO TIME, WE MAY INVEST IN BUSINESS INFRASTRUCTURE, ACQUISITIONS OF NEW BUSINESSES, AND EXPANSION OF EXISTING

BUSINESSES, SUCH AS OUR RETAIL OPERATIONS, WHICH REQUIRE SUBSTANTIAL CASH INVESTMENTS AND MANAGEMENT ATTENTION. WE BELIEVE COST EFFECTIVE INVESTMENTS ARE ESSENTIAL TO BUSINESS GROWTH AND PROFITABILITY. HOWEVER, SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS ARE SUBJECT TO

TYPICAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES INHERENT IN ACQUIRING OR EXPANDING A BUSINESS. THE FAILURE OF ANY SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT TO PROVIDE THE RETURNS OR PROFITABILITY WE EXPECT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS AND DIVERT

MANAGEMENT ATTENTION FROM MORE PROFITABLE BUSINESS OPERATIONS.

17

TABLE OF CONTENTS

WE DEPEND ON KEY PERSONNEL, THE LOSS OF WHOM WOULD HARM OUR BUSINESS.

OUR FUTURE SUCCESS WILL DEPEND IN PART ON THE CONTINUED SERVICE OF KEY EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AND PERSONNEL. THE LOSS OF THE SERVICES OF ANY

KEY INDIVIDUAL COULD HARM US. OUR FUTURE SUCCESS ALSO DEPENDS ON OUR ABILITY TO IDENTIFY, ATTRACT AND RETAIN ADDITIONAL QUALIFIED PERSONNEL. COMPETITION FOR EMPLOYEES IN OUR INDUSTRY IS INTENSE AND WE MAY NOT BE SUCCESSFUL IN ATTRACTING AND

RETAINING SUCH PERSONNEL.

THE SALE OF A LARGE NUMBER OF SHARES HELD BY OUR CHAIRMAN COULD DEPRESS THE MARKET PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK.

PHILIP H. KNIGHT, CO-FOUNDER AND CHAIRMAN OF OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS, BENEFICIALLY OWNS OVER 74.6% OF OUR CLASS A

COMMON STOCK. IF ALL OF HIS CLASS A COMMON STOCK WERE CONVERTED INTO CLASS B COMMON STOCK, MR. KNIGHT WOULD OWN OVER 17.8% OF OUR CLASS B COMMON STOCK. THESE SHARES ARE AVAILABLE FOR RESALE, SUBJECT TO THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE U.S.

SECURITIES LAWS. THE SALE OR PROSPECT OF THE SALE OF A SUBSTANTIAL NUMBER OF THESE SHARES COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE MARKET PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK.

ANTI-TAKEOVER PROVISIONS MAY IMPAIR AN ACQUISITION OF THE COMPANY OR REDUCE THE PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK.

THERE ARE PROVISIONS OF OUR ARTICLES OF INCORPORATION AND OREGON LAW THAT ARE INTENDED TO PROTECT SHAREHOLDER INTERESTS BY PROVIDING THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS A MEANS TO ATTEMPT TO DENY COERCIVE TAKEOVER

ATTEMPTS OR TO NEGOTIATE WITH A POTENTIAL ACQUIRER IN ORDER TO OBTAIN MORE FAVORABLE TERMS. SUCH PROVISIONS INCLUDE A CONTROL SHARE ACQUISITION STATUTE, A FREEZEOUT STATUTE, TWO CLASSES OF STOCK THAT VOTE SEPARATELY ON CERTAIN ISSUES, AND THE FACT

THAT HOLDERS OF CLASS A COMMON STOCK ELECT THREE-FOURTHS OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS ROUNDED DOWN TO THE NEXT WHOLE NUMBER. HOWEVER, SUCH PROVISIONS COULD DISCOURAGE, DELAY OR PREVENT AN UNSOLICITED MERGER, ACQUISITION OR OTHER CHANGE IN CONTROL

OF OUR COMPANY THAT SOME SHAREHOLDERS MIGHT BELIEVE TO BE IN THEIR BEST INTERESTS OR IN WHICH SHAREHOLDERS MIGHT RECEIVE A PREMIUM FOR THEIR COMMON STOCK OVER THE PREVAILING MARKET PRICE. THESE PROVISIONS COULD ALSO DISCOURAGE PROXY CONTESTS FOR

CONTROL OF THE COMPANY.

WE MAY FAIL TO MEET ANALYST EXPECTATIONS, WHICH COULD CAUSE THE PRICE OF OUR STOCK TO DECLINE.

OUR CLASS B COMMON STOCK IS TRADED PUBLICLY, AND AT ANY GIVEN TIME VARIOUS SECURITIES ANALYSTS FOLLOW OUR FINANCIAL

RESULTS AND ISSUE REPORTS ON US. THESE REPORTS INCLUDE INFORMATION ABOUT OUR HISTORICAL FINANCIAL RESULTS AS WELL AS THE ANALYSTS ESTIMATES OF OUR FUTURE PERFORMANCE. THE ANALYSTS ESTIMATES ARE BASED UPON THEIR OWN OPINIONS AND ARE OFTEN

DIFFERENT FROM OUR ESTIMATES OR EXPECTATIONS. IF OUR OPERATING RESULTS ARE BELOW THE ESTIMATES OR EXPECTATIONS OF PUBLIC MARKET ANALYSTS AND INVESTORS, OUR STOCK PRICE COULD DECLINE. IN THE PAST, SECURITIES CLASS ACTION LITIGATION HAS BEEN BROUGHT

AGAINST NIKE AND OTHER COMPANIES FOLLOWING A DECLINE IN THE MARKET PRICE OF THEIR SECURITIES. IF OUR STOCK PRICE IS VOLATILE, WE MAY BECOME INVOLVED IN THIS TYPE OF LITIGATION IN THE FUTURE. ANY LITIGATION COULD RESULT IN SUBSTANTIAL COSTS AND A

DIVERSION OF MANAGEMENTS ATTENTION AND RESOURCES THAT ARE NEEDED TO SUCCESSFULLY RUN OUR BUSINESS.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

NIKE DESIGNS, DEVELOPS, MARKETS AND SELLS HIGH QUALITY FOOTWEAR, APPAREL, EQUIPMENT AND ACCESSORY PRODUCTS WORLDWIDE. WE ARE THE LARGEST

SELLER OF ATHLETIC FOOTWEAR AND APPAREL IN THE WORLD. WE SELL OUR PRODUCTS TO RETAIL ACCOUNTS, THROUGH NIKE-OWNED RETAIL STORES AND INTERNET SALES, WHICH WE REFER TO AS OUR DIRECT TO CONSUMER OPERATIONS, AND THROUGH A MIX OF INDEPENDENT

DISTRIBUTORS AND LICENSEES, WORLDWIDE. OUR GOAL IS TO DELIVER VALUE TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS BY BUILDING A PROFITABLE GLOBAL PORTFOLIO OF BRANDED FOOTWEAR, APPAREL, EQUIPMENT AND ACCESSORIES BUSINESSES. OUR STRATEGY IS TO ACHIEVE LONG-TERM REVENUE GROWTH

BY CREATING INNOVATIVE, MUST HAVE PRODUCTS, BUILDING DEEP PERSONAL CONSUMER CONNECTIONS WITH OUR BRANDS, AND DELIVERING COMPELLING RETAIL PRESENTATION AND EXPERIENCES.

IN ADDITION TO ACHIEVING LONG-TERM REVENUE GROWTH, WE CONTINUE TO STRIVE TO DELIVER SHAREHOLDER VALUE BY DRIVING OPERATIONAL EXCELLENCE

IN SEVERAL KEY AREAS.



MAKING OUR SUPPLY CHAIN A COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE THROUGH OPERATIONAL DISCIPLINE,



REDUCING PRODUCT COSTS THROUGH A CONTINUED FOCUS ON LEAN MANUFACTURING AND PRODUCT DESIGN THAT STRIVES TO ELIMINATE WASTE,



IMPROVING SELLING AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE PRODUCTIVITY BY FOCUSING ON INVESTMENTS THAT DRIVE ECONOMIC RETURNS IN THE FORM OF INCREMENTAL REVENUE AND

GROSS MARGIN, AND LEVERAGING EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE ACROSS OUR PORTFOLIO OF BRANDS TO ELIMINATE DUPLICATIVE COSTS,



IMPROVING WORKING CAPITAL EFFICIENCY, AND



DEPLOYING CAPITAL EFFECTIVELY TO CREATE VALUE FOR OUR SHAREHOLDERS.

THROUGH EXECUTION OF THIS STRATEGY, OUR LONG-TERM FINANCIAL GOALS CONTINUE TO BE.



HIGH SINGLE-DIGIT REVENUE GROWTH,



MID-TEENS EARNINGS PER SHARE GROWTH,



INCREASED RETURN ON INVESTED CAPITAL AND ACCELERATED CASH FLOWS, AND



CONSISTENT RESULTS THROUGH EFFECTIVE MANAGEMENT OF OUR DIVERSIFIED PORTFOLIO OF BUSINESSES.

23

TABLE OF CONTENTS

OVER THE PAST TEN YEARS, WE HAVE ACHIEVED OR EXCEEDED ALL OF THESE FINANCIAL GOALS. DURING

THIS TIME, NIKE, INCS REVENUES AND EARNINGS PER SHARE HAVE GROWN 8% AND 15%, RESPECTIVELY, ON AN ANNUAL COMPOUNDED BASIS. OUR RETURN ON INVESTED CAPITAL HAS INCREASED FROM 14% TO 22% AND WE EXPANDED GROSS MARGINS BY MORE THAN 5 PERCENTAGE

POINTS.

OUR FISCAL 2011 RESULTS DEMONSTRATED OUR CONTINUED FOCUS TOWARD MEETING OUR FINANCIAL GOALS, WHILE POSITIONING

OURSELVES FOR SUSTAINABLE, PROFITABLE LONG-TERM GROWTH. DESPITE THE UNCERTAIN MACROECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT IN FISCAL 2011, WE DELIVERED RECORD HIGH REVENUES AND DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE. OUR REVENUES GREW 10% TO $20.9 BILLION, NET INCOME INCREASED

12% TO $2.1 BILLION, AND WE DELIVERED DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE OF $4.39, A 14% INCREASE FROM FISCAL 2010.

INCOME BEFORE

INCOME TAXES INCREASED 13% FOR FISCAL 2011 PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF THE INCREASE IN REVENUES AND LEVERAGE ON SELLING AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE, WHICH MORE THAN OFFSET A DECREASE IN GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE. THE INCREASE IN REVENUES IS REFLECTIVE OF

INCREASED DEMAND FOR NIKE BRAND FOOTWEAR AND APPAREL PRODUCTS ACROSS MOST BUSINESSES, PARTICULARLY IN THE NORTH AMERICA, EMERGING MARKETS AND GREATER CHINA GEOGRAPHIES. DEMAND FOR OUR NIKE BRAND FOOTWEAR AND APPAREL WAS FUELED BY OUR INNOVATIVE

PRODUCTS AS WELL AS STRONG CATEGORY FOCUSED RETAIL PRESENTATIONS. THE DECREASE IN GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY HIGHER PRODUCT INPUT COSTS, INCREASED TRANSPORTATION EXPENSES AND A LOWER MIX OF LICENSEE REVENUE AS CERTAIN MARKETS

WITHIN OUR OTHER BUSINESSES TRANSITIONED TO NIKE, INC. OWNED MARKETS. THESE FACTORS MORE THAN OFFSET THE POSITIVE IMPACT FROM THE GROWTH AND EXPANDING PROFITABILITY OF OUR NIKE BRAND DIRECT TO CONSUMER BUSINESS AND OUR ONGOING PRODUCT COST REDUCTION

INITIATIVES.

NET INCOME FOR FISCAL 2011 WAS NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY A YEAR-OVER-YEAR INCREASE OF 80 BASIS POINTS IN OUR

EFFECTIVE TAX RATE, DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY AN INCREASE IN THE PERCENTAGE OF TOTAL PRE-TAX INCOME EARNED FROM OPERATIONS IN THE UNITED STATES. THE UNITED STATES STATUTORY TAX RATE IS GENERALLY HIGHER THAN THE TAX RATE ON OPERATIONS OUTSIDE THE UNITED

STATES.

FOR THE YEAR, DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE GREW AT A HIGHER RATE THAN NET INCOME DUE TO A 2% DECREASE IN THE WEIGHTED

AVERAGE NUMBER OF DILUTED COMMON SHARES OUTSTANDING DRIVEN BY OUR SHARE REPURCHASES DURING FISCAL 2011. WHILE WE INCREASED THE USE OF WORKING CAPITAL IN FISCAL 2011 TO SUPPORT THE GROWTH OF OUR BUSINESSES, WE RETURNED LARGER AMOUNTS OF CASH TO OUR

SHAREHOLDERS THROUGH HIGHER DIVIDENDS AND INCREASED SHARE REPURCHASES COMPARED TO FISCAL 2010.

WHILE WE CONTINUE TO BELIEVE

THAT THE COMPANY IS WELL POSITIONED FROM A BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL PERSPECTIVE, OUR FUTURE PERFORMANCE IS SUBJECT TO THE INHERENT UNCERTAINTY PRESENTED BY VOLATILE MACROECONOMIC CONDITIONS THAT MAY HAVE AN IMPACT ON OUR OPERATIONS AROUND THE WORLD.

OUR FUTURE PERFORMANCE IS SUBJECT TO OUR CONTINUED ABILITY TO TAKE APPROPRIATE ACTIONS TO RESPOND TO THESE CONDITIONS.

FISCAL 2011 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2010

ON BOTH A REPORTED AND CURRENCY NEUTRAL BASIS, REVENUES FOR NIKE, INC. GREW 10% FOR FISCAL 2011, DRIVEN BY INCREASES IN

REVENUES FOR BOTH THE NIKE BRAND AND OUR OTHER BUSINESSES. ON A CURRENCY NEUTRAL BASIS, REVENUES FOR THE NIKE BRAND INCREASED 10% FOR FISCAL 2011, WHILE REVENUES FOR OUR OTHER BUSINESSES INCREASED 8%. EXCLUDING THE EFFECTS OF CHANGES IN CURRENCY

EXCHANGE RATES, EVERY NIKE BRAND GEOGRAPHY EXCEPT JAPAN DELIVERED HIGHER REVENUES FOR FISCAL 2011, LED BY NORTH AMERICA, WHICH CONTRIBUTED APPROXIMATELY 5 PERCENTAGE POINTS TO THE NIKE BRAND REVENUE INCREASE. THE EMERGING MARKETS AND GREATER CHINA

CONTRIBUTED APPROXIMATELY 3 AND 2 PERCENTAGE POINTS TO THE NIKE BRAND REVENUE GROWTH, RESPECTIVELY.

BY PRODUCT GROUP, NIKE

BRAND FOOTWEAR AND APPAREL REVENUE INCREASED 11% AND 9%, RESPECTIVELY, WHILE NIKE BRAND EQUIPMENT REVENUES DECLINED 2% DURING FISCAL 2011. FUELING THE GROWTH OF OUR NIKE BRAND FOOTWEAR BUSINESS WAS THE INCREASED DEMAND IN OUR PERFORMANCE PRODUCTS,

INCLUDING THE NIKE LUNAR AND FREE TECHNOLOGIES WHICH ARE USED ACROSS MULTIPLE CATEGORIES. THE INCREASE IN NIKE BRAND FOOTWEAR REVENUE FOR FISCAL 2011 WAS ATTRIBUTABLE TO A HIGH SINGLE-DIGIT PERCENTAGE INCREASE IN UNIT SALES ALONG WITH A LOW

SINGLE-DIGIT PERCENTAGE INCREASE IN THE AVERAGE SELLING PRICE PER PAIR. THE INCREASE IN UNIT SALES WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY DOUBLE-DIGIT PERCENTAGE GROWTH IN RUNNING, MENS TRAINING, ACTION SPORTS AND WOMENS TRAINING PRODUCTS, WHILE THE

INCREASE IN AVERAGE SELLING PRICE PER PAIR WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY PRICE INCREASES ON SELECTED PRODUCTS

25

TABLE OF CONTENTS

AND FEWER CLOSE-OUTS AS A PERCENTAGE OF TOTAL SALES. FOR NIKE BRAND APPAREL, THE INCREASE IN REVENUE FOR FISCAL 2011 WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY A LOW DOUBLE-DIGIT PERCENTAGE INCREASE IN UNIT SALES

ATTRIBUTABLE TO STRONG CATEGORY PRESENTATIONS AND IMPROVED PRODUCT LINES, WHILE THE AVERAGE SELLING PRICE PER UNIT WAS RELATIVELY FLAT. THE INCREASE IN UNIT SALES WAS DRIVEN BY INCREASED DEMAND IN ALL KEY CATEGORIES.

WHILE WHOLESALE REVENUES REMAIN THE LARGEST COMPONENT OF OVERALL NIKE BRAND REVENUES, WE CONTINUE TO SEE GROWTH IN REVENUE THROUGH OUR

DIRECT TO CONSUMER CHANNELS. OUR NIKE BRAND DIRECT TO CONSUMER OPERATIONS INCLUDE NIKE OWNED IN-LINE AND FACTORY STORES, AS WELL AS ONLINE SALES THROUGH NIKE OWNED WEBSITES. FOR FISCAL 2011, DIRECT TO CONSUMER CHANNELS REPRESENTED APPROXIMATELY 16%

OF OUR TOTAL NIKE BRAND REVENUES COMPARED TO 15% IN FISCAL 2010. ON A CURRENCY NEUTRAL BASIS, DIRECT TO CONSUMER REVENUES GREW 16% FOR FISCAL 2011 AS WE CONTINUE TO EXPAND OUR STORE NETWORK, INCREASE COMPARABLE STORE SALES AND BUILD OUR E-COMMERCE

BUSINESS. COMPARABLE STORE SALES GREW 11% FOR FISCAL 2011. COMPARABLE STORE SALES INCLUDE REVENUES FROM NIKE OWNED IN-LINE AND FACTORY STORES FOR WHICH ALL THREE OF THE FOLLOWING REQUIREMENTS HAVE BEEN MET: THE STORE HAS BEEN OPEN AT LEAST ONE YEAR,

SQUARE FOOTAGE HAS NOT CHANGED BY MORE THAN 15% WITHIN THE PAST YEAR, AND THE STORE HAS NOT BEEN PERMANENTLY REPOSITIONED WITHIN THE PAST YEAR.

REVENUES FOR OUR OTHER BUSINESSES CONSIST OF RESULTS FROM OUR AFFILIATE BRANDS; COLE HAAN, CONVERSE, HURLEY AND UMBRO; AND NIKE GOLF. EXCLUDING THE IMPACT OF CURRENCY CHANGES, REVENUES FOR THESE

BUSINESSES INCREASED BY 8% IN FISCAL 2011, REFLECTING DOUBLE-DIGIT PERCENTAGE REVENUE GROWTH AT CONVERSE, COLE HAAN AND HURLEY, AND A LOW SINGLE-DIGIT GROWTH AT UMBRO, WHICH MORE THAN OFFSET A MID SINGLE-DIGIT REVENUE DECLINE AT NIKE GOLF.

FISCAL 2010 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2009

EXCLUDING THE EFFECTS OF CHANGES IN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES, REVENUES FOR NIKE, INC. DECLINED 2%, DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY A 2% DECLINE IN REVENUES FOR THE NIKE BRAND. ALL OF OUR GEOGRAPHIES DELIVERED LOWER

REVENUES WITH THE EXCEPTION OF EMERGING MARKETS, REFLECTING A CHALLENGING ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT ACROSS MOST MARKETS, MOST NOTABLY IN OUR WESTERN EUROPE AND CENTRAL & EASTERN EUROPE GEOGRAPHIES. BY PRODUCT GROUP, REVENUES FOR OUR WORLDWIDE NIKE

BRAND FOOTWEAR BUSINESS WERE DOWN 1% COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR. WORLDWIDE NIKE BRAND APPAREL AND EQUIPMENT REVENUES DECLINED 5% AND 7%, RESPECTIVELY. OUR DIRECT TO CONSUMER OPERATIONS REPRESENTED APPROXIMATELY 15% OF OUR TOTAL NIKE BRAND REVENUES

IN FISCAL 2010 AS COMPARED TO 13% IN FISCAL 2009.

EXCLUDING THE IMPACT OF CURRENCY CHANGES, REVENUES FOR OUR OTHER BUSINESSES

INCREASED BY 4% FOR FISCAL 2010, DRIVEN BY INCREASED REVENUES AT CONVERSE, UMBRO AND HURLEY, WHICH MORE THAN OFFSET REVENUE DECLINES AT NIKE GOLF AND COLE HAAN.

FUTURES ORDERS

FUTURES AND ADVANCE ORDERS FOR NIKE BRAND FOOTWEAR AND

APPAREL SCHEDULED FOR DELIVERY FROM JUNE THROUGH NOVEMBER 2011 WERE 15% HIGHER THAN THE ORDERS REPORTED FOR THE COMPARABLE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD. THIS FUTURES AND ADVANCE ORDER AMOUNT IS CALCULATED BASED UPON OUR FORECAST OF THE ACTUAL EXCHANGE RATES

UNDER WHICH OUR REVENUES WILL BE TRANSLATED DURING THIS PERIOD, WHICH APPROXIMATE CURRENT SPOT RATES. EXCLUDING THE IMPACT OF CURRENCY CHANGES, FUTURES ORDERS INCREASED 12%, PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY A HIGH SINGLE-DIGIT PERCENTAGE INCREASE IN UNIT

SALES VOLUME AND A LOW SINGLE-DIGIT PERCENTAGE INCREASE IN AVERAGE PRICE PER UNIT FOR BOTH FOOTWEAR AND APPAREL PRODUCTS.

EXCLUDING THE IMPACT OF FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE FLUCTUATIONS.

THE REPORTED FUTURES AND ADVANCE

ORDERS GROWTH IS NOT NECESSARILY INDICATIVE OF OUR EXPECTATION OF REVENUE GROWTH DURING THIS PERIOD. THIS IS DUE TO YEAR-OVER-YEAR CHANGES IN SHIPMENT TIMING AND BECAUSE THE MIX OF ORDERS CAN SHIFT BETWEEN ADVANCE/FUTURES AND AT-ONCE ORDERS AND THE

FULFILLMENT OF CERTAIN ORDERS MAY FALL OUTSIDE OF THE SCHEDULE NOTED ABOVE. IN ADDITION, EXCHANGE RATE FLUCTUATIONS AS WELL AS DIFFERING LEVELS OF ORDER CANCELLATIONS AND DISCOUNTS CAN CAUSE DIFFERENCES IN THE COMPARISONS BETWEEN ADVANCE/FUTURES

ORDERS AND ACTUAL REVENUES. MOREOVER, A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR REVENUE IS NOT DERIVED FROM FUTURES AND ADVANCE ORDERS, INCLUDING AT-ONCE AND CLOSE-OUT SALES OF NIKE BRAND FOOTWEAR AND APPAREL, SALES OF NIKE BRAND EQUIPMENT, SALES FROM OUR DIRECT

FISCAL 2011 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2010

FOR FISCAL 2011, OUR CONSOLIDATED GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE WAS 70 BASIS POINTS LOWER THAN THE PRIOR YEAR. THE PRIMARY FACTORS CONTRIBUTING

TO THIS DECREASE WERE AS FOLLOWS.



HIGHER INPUT COSTS ACROSS MOST BUSINESSES,



INCREASED TRANSPORTATION COSTS, INCLUDING ADDITIONAL AIR FREIGHT INCURRED TO MEET STRONG DEMAND FOR NIKE BRAND PRODUCTS ACROSS MOST BUSINESSES, MOST

NOTABLY IN NORTH AMERICA, WESTERN EUROPE, AND CENTRAL & EASTERN EUROPE GEOGRAPHIES, AND



A LOWER MIX OF LICENSEE REVENUE AS DISTRIBUTION FOR CERTAIN MARKETS WITHIN OUR OTHER BUSINESSES TRANSITIONED FROM LICENSEES TO OPERATING UNITS OF NIKE,

INC.

TOGETHER, THESE FACTORS DECREASED CONSOLIDATED GROSS MARGINS BY APPROXIMATELY 130 BASIS POINTS FOR

FISCAL 2011, WITH THE MOST SIGNIFICANT EROSION IN THE SECOND HALF OF THE FISCAL YEAR. THESE DECREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE POSITIVE IMPACT FROM THE GROWTH AND EXPANDING PROFITABILITY OF OUR NIKE BRAND DIRECT TO CONSUMER BUSINESS, A HIGHER

MIX OF FULL-PRICE SALES AND FAVORABLE IMPACTS FROM OUR ONGOING PRODUCT COST EFFICIENCY INITIATIVES.

AS WE HEAD INTO FISCAL

2012, WE ANTICIPATE THAT OUR GROSS MARGINS WILL CONTINUE TO FACE PRESSURE FROM MACROECONOMIC FACTORS, MOST NOTABLY RISING PRODUCT INPUT COSTS AS WELL AS HIGHER TRANSPORTATION COSTS, WHICH MAY MORE THAN OFFSET THE FAVORABLE IMPACT FROM OUR PLANNED

PRICE INCREASES AND ONGOING PRODUCTION COST EFFICIENCY INITIATIVES.

FISCAL 2010 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2009

FOR FISCAL 2010, OUR CONSOLIDATED GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE WAS 140 BASIS POINTS HIGHER THAN THE PRIOR YEAR. THE PRIMARY FACTORS

CONTRIBUTING TO THIS IMPROVEMENT WERE AS FOLLOWS.



IMPROVED IN-LINE PRODUCT MARGINS ACROSS MOST GEOGRAPHIES, DRIVEN BY REDUCED RAW MATERIAL AND FREIGHT COSTS AS WELL AS FAVORABLE CHANGES IN PRODUCT MIX,

27

TABLE OF CONTENTS



IMPROVED INVENTORY POSITIONS, MOST NOTABLY IN NORTH AMERICA AND WESTERN EUROPE, WHICH DROVE A SHIFT IN MIX FROM DISCOUNTED CLOSE-OUT TO HIGHER MARGIN

IN-LINE SALES, AND



GROWTH OF NIKE-OWNED RETAIL AS A PERCENTAGE OF TOTAL REVENUE, ACROSS MOST NIKE BRAND GEOGRAPHIES, DRIVEN BY AN INCREASE IN BOTH NEW STORE OPENINGS AND

COMPARABLE STORE SALES.

TOGETHER, THESE FACTORS INCREASED CONSOLIDATED GROSS MARGINS BY APPROXIMATELY 160

BASIS POINTS FOR FISCAL 2010. THESE INCREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE IMPACT OF UNFAVORABLE CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES, PRIMARILY AFFECTING OUR EMERGING MARKETS AND CENTRAL & EASTERN EUROPE GEOGRAPHIES.

FISCAL 2011 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2010

IN FISCAL 2011, THE EFFECT OF CHANGES IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES DID NOT HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON SELLING AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE.

DEMAND CREATION EXPENSE INCREASED 4% COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR, PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY A HIGHER LEVEL OF BRAND EVENT SPENDING AROUND THE

WORLD CUP AND WORLD BASKETBALL FESTIVAL IN THE FIRST HALF OF FISCAL 2011, AS WELL AS INCREASED SPENDING AROUND KEY PRODUCT INITIATIVES AND INVESTMENTS IN RETAIL PRODUCT PRESENTATION WITH WHOLESALE CUSTOMERS.

OPERATING OVERHEAD EXPENSE INCREASED 7% COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR. THIS INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO INCREASED INVESTMENTS IN

OUR DIRECT TO CONSUMER OPERATIONS AS WELL AS GROWTH IN OUR WHOLESALE OPERATIONS, WHERE WE INCURRED HIGHER PERSONNEL COSTS AND TRAVEL EXPENSES AS COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR.

FISCAL 2010 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2009

IN FISCAL 2010, CHANGES IN CURRENCY

EXCHANGE RATES HAD A MINIMAL IMPACT ON DEMAND CREATION EXPENSE. DEMAND CREATION EXPENSE REMAINED FLAT COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR, AS INCREASES IN SPORTS MARKETING AND DIGITAL MARKETING EXPENSES WERE OFFSET BY REDUCTIONS IN ADVERTISING.

EXCLUDING CHANGES IN EXCHANGE RATES, OPERATING OVERHEAD EXPENSE INCREASED 4% COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR DUE PRIMARILY TO INCREASES IN

PERFORMANCE-BASED COMPENSATION AND INVESTMENTS IN OUR DIRECT TO CONSUMER OPERATIONS. THESE INCREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY REDUCTIONS IN COMPENSATION SPENDING IN FISCAL 2010 AS A RESULT OF RESTRUCTURING ACTIVITIES THAT TOOK PLACE IN THE FOURTH

QUARTER OF FISCAL 2009.

RESTRUCTURING CHARGES

DURING FISCAL 2009, WE RESTRUCTURED THE ORGANIZATION TO STREAMLINE OUR MANAGEMENT STRUCTURE, ENHANCE CONSUMER FOCUS, DRIVE INNOVATION MORE

QUICKLY TO MARKET AND ESTABLISH A MORE SCALABLE COST STRUCTURE. AS A RESULT OF THESE ACTIONS, WE REDUCED OUR GLOBAL WORKFORCE BY APPROXIMATELY 5% AND INCURRED PRE-TAX RESTRUCTURING CHARGES OF $195 MILLION IN FISCAL 2009, PRIMARILY CONSISTING OF CASH

SEVERANCE COSTS. THESE CHARGES ARE INCLUDED IN CORPORATE FOR SEGMENT REPORTING PURPOSES.

GOODWILL, INTANGIBLES AND OTHER ASSETS IMPAIRMENT

IN FISCAL 2009, WE RECOGNIZED NON-CASH IMPAIRMENT CHARGES OF $199 MILLION AND $202 MILLION RELATING TO UMBROS GOODWILL, INTANGIBLES

AND OTHER ASSETS, RESPECTIVELY. ALTHOUGH UMBROS FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE FOR FISCAL 2009 WAS SLIGHTLY BETTER THAN WE HAD ORIGINALLY EXPECTED, PROJECTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS HAD FALLEN BELOW THE LEVELS WE EXPECTED AT THE TIME OF ACQUISITION. THIS

EROSION WAS A RESULT OF BOTH THE UNPRECEDENTED DECLINE IN GLOBAL CONSUMER MARKETS, PARTICULARLY IN THE UNITED KINGDOM, AND OUR DECISION TO ADJUST THE LEVEL OF INVESTMENT IN THE BUSINESS.

FISCAL 2011 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2010

OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR FISCAL 2011 WAS 80 BASIS POINTS HIGHER THAN THE EFFECTIVE RATE FOR FISCAL 2010 DUE PRIMARILY TO THE CHANGE IN

GEOGRAPHIC MIX OF EARNINGS. A LARGER PERCENTAGE OF OUR EARNINGS IN FISCAL 2011 WERE ATTRIBUTABLE TO OPERATIONS IN THE U.S., WHERE THE STATUTORY TAX RATE IS GENERALLY HIGHER THAN THE TAX RATE ON OPERATIONS OUTSIDE OF THE U.S. THIS IMPACT WAS

PARTIALLY OFFSET BY CHANGES TO UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS.

FISCAL 2010 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2009

OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR FISCAL 2010 WAS 20 BASIS POINTS HIGHER THAN THE EFFECTIVE RATE FOR FISCAL 2009. OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR

FISCAL 2009 INCLUDES A TAX BENEFIT RELATED TO CHARGES RECORDED FOR THE IMPAIRMENT OF UMBROS

TABLE OF CONTENTS

GOODWILL, INTANGIBLE AND OTHER ASSETS. EXCLUDING THIS TAX BENEFIT, OUR EFFECTIVE RATE FOR FISCAL 2009 WOULD HAVE BEEN 26.5%, 230 BASIS POINTS HIGHER THAN OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR FISCAL 2010.

THE DECREASE IN OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR FISCAL 2010 WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS, AS TAX RATES FOR THESE OPERATIONS ARE GENERALLY LOWER THAN THE U.S. STATUTORY RATE.

OPERATING SEGMENTS

THE

COMPANYS REPORTABLE OPERATING SEGMENTS ARE BASED ON OUR INTERNAL GEOGRAPHIC ORGANIZATION. EACH NIKE BRAND GEOGRAPHY OPERATES PREDOMINANTLY IN ONE INDUSTRY: THE DESIGN, DEVELOPMENT, MARKETING AND SELLING OF ATHLETIC FOOTWEAR, APPAREL, AND

EQUIPMENT. OUR REPORTABLE OPERATING SEGMENTS FOR THE NIKE BRAND ARE: NORTH AMERICA, WESTERN EUROPE, CENTRAL & EASTERN EUROPE, GREATER CHINA, JAPAN, AND EMERGING MARKETS. OUR NIKE BRAND DIRECT TO CONSUMER OPERATIONS ARE MANAGED WITHIN EACH

GEOGRAPHIC SEGMENT.

AS PART OF OUR CENTRALLY MANAGED FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK MANAGEMENT PROGRAM, STANDARD FOREIGN CURRENCY

RATES ARE ASSIGNED TO EACH NIKE BRAND ENTITY IN OUR GEOGRAPHIC OPERATING SEGMENTS AND ARE USED TO RECORD ANY NON-FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY REVENUES OR PRODUCT PURCHASES INTO THE ENTITYS FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY. GEOGRAPHIC OPERATING SEGMENT REVENUES AND

COST OF SALES REFLECT USE OF THESE STANDARD RATES. FOR ALL NIKE BRAND OPERATING SEGMENTS, DIFFERENCES BETWEEN ASSIGNED STANDARD FOREIGN CURRENCY RATES AND ACTUAL MARKET RATES ARE INCLUDED IN CORPORATE TOGETHER WITH FOREIGN CURRENCY HEDGE GAINS AND

LOSSES GENERATED FROM OUR CENTRALLY MANAGED FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK MANAGEMENT PROGRAM. PRIOR TO FISCAL 2010, ALL FOREIGN CURRENCY RESULTS, INCLUDING HEDGE RESULTS AND OTHER CONVERSION GAINS AND LOSSES GENERATED BY THE WESTERN EUROPE AND CENTRAL &

EASTERN EUROPE GEOGRAPHIES WERE RECORDED IN THEIR RESPECTIVE GEOGRAPHIC RESULTS.

CERTAIN PRIOR YEAR AMOUNTS HAVE BEEN

RECLASSIFIED TO CONFORM TO FISCAL 2011 PRESENTATION, AS SOUTH AFRICA BECAME PART OF THE EMERGING MARKETS OPERATING SEGMENT BEGINNING JUNE 1, 2010. PREVIOUSLY, SOUTH AFRICA WAS PART OF THE CENTRAL & EASTERN EUROPE OPERATING SEGMENT.

FISCAL 2011 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2010

REVENUES FOR NORTH AMERICA INCREASED 13%, DRIVEN BY DOUBLE-DIGIT PERCENTAGE GROWTH IN BOTH WHOLESALE AND DIRECT TO CONSUMER REVENUES.

CONTRIBUTING TO THE WHOLESALE REVENUE GROWTH WAS STRONG PRODUCT CATEGORY PRESENTATIONS AT OUR WHOLESALE CUSTOMERS, IMPROVED PRODUCT LINES AND EARLIER SHIPMENTS OF SUMMER SEASON

31

TABLE OF CONTENTS

PRODUCTS. NORTH AMERICAS DIRECT TO CONSUMER REVENUES GREW 19%, WHICH CONTRIBUTED APPROXIMATELY 4 PERCENTAGE POINTS TO NORTH AMERICAS REVENUE INCREASE. THE GROWTH IN THE DIRECT TO

CONSUMER BUSINESS WAS FUELED BY 14% GROWTH IN COMPARABLE STORE SALES.

FOR FISCAL 2011, THE INCREASE IN NORTH AMERICA FOOTWEAR

REVENUE WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY DOUBLE-DIGIT PERCENTAGE GROWTH IN RUNNING, MENS AND WOMENS TRAINING AND FOOTBALL (SOCCER) CATEGORIES AND A SINGLE-DIGIT PERCENTAGE GROWTH IN BASKETBALL, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A LOW SINGLE-DIGIT PERCENTAGE

DECLINE IN SALES OF OUR NIKE BRAND SPORTSWEAR PRODUCTS.

THE YEAR-OVER-YEAR INCREASE IN NORTH AMERICA APPAREL REVENUES WAS

PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY DOUBLE-DIGIT PERCENTAGE GROWTH IN MOST KEY CATEGORIES, MOST NOTABLY MENS TRAINING, RUNNING, BASKETBALL AND WOMENS TRAINING.

FOR FISCAL 2011, THE INCREASE IN NORTH AMERICAS EBIT WAS PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF REVENUE GROWTH AND LEVERAGE ON SELLING AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE, WHICH MORE THAN OFFSET A LOWER GROSS MARGIN

PERCENTAGE. THE DECLINE IN GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE WAS DUE PRIMARILY TO INCREASED AIR FREIGHT AND PRODUCT INPUT COSTS, WHICH MORE THAN OFFSET THE FAVORABLE IMPACT FROM THE GROWTH OF OUR DIRECT TO CONSUMER BUSINESS AND FEWER CLOSE-OUT SALES.

FISCAL 2010 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2009

EXCLUDING THE CHANGES IN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES, REVENUES FOR NORTH AMERICA DECLINED 1%, DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY A DECREASE IN REVENUE FROM OUR WHOLESALE BUSINESS. THIS DECREASE WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN

INCREASE IN OUR NIKE-OWNED RETAIL BUSINESS, DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY AN INCREASE IN COMPARABLE STORE SALES.

DURING FISCAL 2010,

THE DECREASE IN NORTH AMERICA FOOTWEAR REVENUE WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO A LOW SINGLE-DIGIT PERCENTAGE DECREASE IN UNIT SALES, WHILE AVERAGE SELLING PRICE PER PAIR REMAINED FLAT. THE DECLINE IN UNIT SALES WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY LOWER SALES FOR

OUR KIDS AND RUNNING CATEGORIES IN THE FIRST HALF OF FISCAL 2010.

NORTH AMERICA APPAREL REVENUE DURING FISCAL 2010 WAS

FLAT WHEN COMPARED TO FISCAL 2009, WHICH WAS REFLECTIVE OF A HIGH SINGLE-DIGIT PERCENTAGE INCREASE IN AVERAGE SELLING PRICE PER UNIT, OFFSET BY A LOW DOUBLE-DIGIT PERCENTAGE DECREASE IN UNIT SALES. BOTH THE INCREASE IN AVERAGE SELLING PRICE PER UNIT

AND THE DECREASE IN UNIT SALES WERE PRIMARILY A RESULT OF FEWER CLOSE-OUT SALES COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR.

FOR FISCAL 2010,

THE INCREASE IN NORTH AMERICAS EBIT WAS PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF IMPROVED GROSS MARGINS COMBINED WITH A SLIGHT DECREASE IN SELLING AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE, DRIVEN BY A REDUCTION IN DEMAND CREATION EXPENSE COMPARED TO PRIOR YEAR. THE

IMPROVEMENT IN GROSS MARGIN WAS MAINLY ATTRIBUTABLE TO A SHIFT IN MIX FROM CLOSE-OUT TO IN-LINE SALES, GROWTH OF OUR DIRECT TO CONSUMER BUSINESS AS A PERCENTAGE OF TOTAL SALES, IMPROVED IN-LINE PRODUCT MARGINS AND LOWER WAREHOUSING COSTS.

FISCAL 2011 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2010

ON A CURRENCY NEUTRAL BASIS, REVENUES FOR WESTERN EUROPE INCREASED 4% FOR FISCAL 2011, ATTRIBUTABLE TO GROWTH IN MOST TERRITORIES.

REVENUES FOR THE U.K. & IRELAND, THE LARGEST MARKET IN WESTERN EUROPE, GREW 5% FOR FISCAL 2011. WESTERN EUROPES DIRECT TO CONSUMER REVENUES GREW 10%, WHICH CONTRIBUTED APPROXIMATELY 1 PERCENTAGE POINT TO WESTERN EUROPES REVENUE

INCREASE. THE GROWTH IN THE DIRECT TO CONSUMER BUSINESS WAS FUELED BY 6% GROWTH IN COMPARABLE STORE SALES.

EXCLUDING CHANGES

IN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES, FOOTWEAR REVENUE IN WESTERN EUROPE INCREASED 7%, DRIVEN BY DOUBLE-DIGIT PERCENTAGE GROWTH IN OUR RUNNING, FOOTBALL (SOCCER) AND ACTION SPORTS CATEGORIES, WHICH MORE THAN OFFSET A SLIGHT REVENUE DECLINE IN OUR NIKE BRAND

SPORTSWEAR CATEGORY.

ON A CURRENCY NEUTRAL BASIS, APPAREL REVENUE IN WESTERN EUROPE INCREASED 2%, PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY

DOUBLE-DIGIT PERCENTAGE GROWTH IN OUR FOOTBALL (SOCCER) AND RUNNING CATEGORIES, WHICH MORE THAN OFFSET A MID SINGLE-DIGIT REVENUE DECLINE IN OUR NIKE BRAND SPORTSWEAR CATEGORY.

FOR FISCAL 2011, THE DECREASE IN WESTERN EUROPES EBIT WAS DRIVEN BY UNFAVORABLE FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION AND A LOWER GROSS

MARGIN PERCENTAGE, ALL OF WHICH MORE THAN OFFSET THE INCREASE IN REVENUES AND IMPROVED LEVERAGE ON SELLING AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE. THE DECLINE IN THE GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE WAS SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACTED BY THE UNFAVORABLE YEAR-OVER-YEAR STANDARD

CURRENCY RATES. ALSO CONTRIBUTING TO THE DECREASE IN THE GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE WAS HIGHER PRODUCT INPUT AND AIR FREIGHT COSTS, HIGHER ROYALTY EXPENSES RELATED TO SALES OF ENDORSED TEAM PRODUCTS AND HIGHER FULL PRICE DISCOUNTS. THESE FACTORS MORE

THAN OFFSET THE FAVORABLE IMPACT OF FEWER CLOSE-OUT SALES.

FISCAL 2010 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2009

ON A CURRENCY NEUTRAL BASIS, MOST MARKETS IN WESTERN EUROPE EXPERIENCED LOWER REVENUES DURING FISCAL 2010, REFLECTING A DIFFICULT RETAIL

ENVIRONMENT THROUGHOUT THE GEOGRAPHY. OUR LARGEST MARKET, THE U.K. & IRELAND, DECLINED 4%.

EXCLUDING CHANGES IN CURRENCY

EXCHANGE RATES, THE DECREASE IN FOOTWEAR REVENUE DURING FISCAL 2010 WAS PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF LOW SINGLE-DIGIT DECREASES IN BOTH AVERAGE SELLING PRICE AND UNIT SALES. THE DECREASE IN AVERAGE SELLING PRICE WAS ATTRIBUTABLE TO HIGHER CUSTOMER

DISCOUNTS PROVIDED TO MANAGE INVENTORY LEVELS, WHILE THE REDUCTION IN UNIT SALES WAS DUE TO LOWER SALES FOR MOST NIKE BRAND PRODUCT CATEGORIES.

THE YEAR-OVER-YEAR DECREASE IN APPAREL REVENUE WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY A HIGH SINGLE-DIGIT DECLINE IN UNIT SALES COMBINED WITH A MID SINGLE-DIGIT DECREASE IN AVERAGE SELLING PRICE. THE DECREASE IN UNIT

SALES WAS DUE TO LOWER SALES FOR MOST NIKE BRAND PRODUCT CATEGORIES, WHILE THE DECREASE IN AVERAGE SELLING PRICE WAS A RESULT OF HIGHER DISCOUNTS PROVIDED TO RETAILERS TO MANAGE THEIR INVENTORY LEVELS.

FOR FISCAL 2010, EBIT FOR WESTERN EUROPE DECLINED AT A FASTER RATE THAN REVENUES, AS THE INCREASE IN SELLING AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE

AS A PERCENTAGE OF REVENUES MORE THAN OFFSET THE IMPROVEMENTS IN GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE. THE INCREASE IN SELLING ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY A HIGHER LEVEL OF BOTH DEMAND CREATION SPENDING AROUND THE 2010 WORLD CUP AND OPERATING

OVERHEAD EXPENSE AS A RESULT OF INVESTMENTS IN OUR DIRECT TO CONSUMER OPERATIONS AND HIGHER PERFORMANCE-BASED COMPENSATION. THE GROSS MARGIN IMPROVEMENT IN FISCAL 2010 WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO HIGHER IN-LINE PRODUCT MARGINS, A SMALLER

PROPORTION OF CLOSE-OUT SALES AND REDUCED INVENTORY OBSOLESCENCE EXPENSE AS A RESULT OF OUR LEANER INVENTORY POSITIONS.

FISCAL 2011 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2010

LED BY RUSSIA AND TURKEY, MOST TERRITORIES WITHIN CENTRAL & EASTERN EUROPE REPORTED REVENUE GROWTH DURING FISCAL 2011 AS ECONOMIC

CONDITIONS IN THE GEOGRAPHY CONTINUED TO SHOW SIGNS OF RECOVERY.

THE GROWTH IN CENTRAL & EASTERN EUROPES FOOTWEAR

REVENUES WAS MAINLY DRIVEN BY DOUBLE-DIGIT PERCENTAGE GROWTH IN OUR FOOTBALL (SOCCER), RUNNING AND ACTION SPORTS CATEGORIES, WHILE THE GROWTH IN APPAREL REVENUES WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY DOUBLE-DIGIT PERCENTAGE GROWTH IN OUR RUNNING CATEGORY.

FOR FISCAL 2011, THE DECREASE IN CENTRAL & EASTERN EUROPES EBIT WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY UNFAVORABLE FOREIGN

CURRENCY TRANSLATION AND A LOWER GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE, WHICH MORE THAN OFFSET THE INCREASE IN REVENUES AND IMPROVED LEVERAGE ON SELLING AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE. THE DECLINE IN THE GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO UNFAVORABLE

YEAR-OVER-YEAR STANDARD CURRENCY RATES, HIGHER AIR FREIGHT COSTS AND AN INCREASE IN PRODUCT INPUT COSTS.

FISCAL 2010

COMPARED TO FISCAL 2009

ECONOMIC CONDITIONS IN CENTRAL & EASTERN EUROPE REMAINED DIFFICULT AS MOST MARKETS WITHIN THE

GEOGRAPHY EXPERIENCED LOWER REVENUES IN FISCAL 2010 AS COMPARED TO FISCAL 2009.

THE DECREASE IN FOOTWEAR REVENUE WAS DUE TO A

DECLINE IN AVERAGE SELLING PRICE, WHILE UNIT SALES REMAINED FLAT COMPARED TO FISCAL 2009. THE DECLINE IN AVERAGE SELLING PRICE WAS PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF HIGHER DISCOUNTS PROVIDED TO RETAILERS TO MANAGE THEIR INVENTORY LEVELS.

THE YEAR-OVER-YEAR DECREASE IN APPAREL REVENUE WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY A DOUBLE-DIGIT DECREASE IN AVERAGE SELLING PRICE AND A MID

SINGLE-DIGIT DECLINE IN UNIT SALES. THE DECLINE IN AVERAGE SELLING PRICE WAS PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF HIGHER DISCOUNTS PROVIDED TO RETAILERS TO MANAGE THEIR INVENTORY LEVELS, WHILE THE DECLINE IN UNIT SALES WAS DUE TO LOWER SALES IN MOST KEY PRODUCT

CATEGORIES.

THE YEAR-OVER-YEAR DECREASE IN CENTRAL & EASTERN EUROPES EBIT DURING FISCAL 2010 WAS THE RESULT OF

LOWER REVENUES, A DECLINE IN GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE AND HIGHER SELLING AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE. THE DECLINE IN GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO LESS FAVORABLE YEAR-OVER-YEAR STANDARD CURRENCY RATES, AS WELL AS HIGHER

DISCOUNTS PROVIDED TO CUSTOMERS. THE INCREASE IN SELLING AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO AN INCREASE IN THE RESERVE FOR BAD DEBTS ALONG WITH INCREASED INVESTMENTS IN OUR DIRECT TO CONSUMER OPERATIONS.

FISCAL 2011 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2010

EXCLUDING CHANGES IN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES, GREATER CHINA REVENUES INCREASED 16% FOR FISCAL 2011, DRIVEN BY EXPANSION IN THE NUMBER OF

PARTNER-OWNED STORES SELLING NIKE PRODUCTS, AS WELL AS IMPROVEMENT IN COMPARABLE STORE SALES FOR PARTNER-OWNED STORES.

FOR

FISCAL 2011, THE INCREASE IN GREATER CHINAS FOOTWEAR REVENUE WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY DOUBLE-DIGIT PERCENTAGE GROWTH IN OUR RUNNING AND NIKE BRAND SPORTSWEAR CATEGORIES, WHILE THE GROWTH IN APPAREL REVENUE WAS MAINLY DRIVEN BY DOUBLE-DIGIT

PERCENTAGE INCREASES IN OUR NIKE BRAND SPORTSWEAR, BASKETBALL AND MENS TRAINING CATEGORIES.

FOR FISCAL 2011, EBIT FOR

GREATER CHINA GREW AT A FASTER RATE THAN REVENUE AS A RESULT OF A HIGHER GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE, IMPROVED LEVERAGE ON SELLING AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE AND FAVORABLE FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION. THE IMPROVEMENT IN THE GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE WAS

PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO HIGHER PRODUCT PRICES, FAVORABLE PRODUCT MIX AND LOWER INVENTORY OBSOLESCENCE EXPENSE, WHICH MORE THAN OFFSET HIGHER PRODUCT INPUT COSTS AND WAREHOUSING COSTS FROM OUR NEW CHINA DISTRIBUTION CENTER.

FISCAL 2010 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2009

FOR FISCAL 2010, REVENUES FOR GREATER CHINA WERE FLAT, PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO COMPARISONS AGAINST STRONG REVENUE GROWTH IN THE FIRST HALF OF FISCAL 2009 DRIVEN BY THE BEIJING OLYMPICS. GREATER CHINA

BEGAN TO GAIN MOMENTUM IN THE SECOND HALF OF FISCAL 2010, AS REVENUES INCREASED 11% AS COMPARED TO THE SECOND HALF OF FISCAL 2009.

THE INCREASE IN FOOTWEAR REVENUE WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY A MID SINGLE-DIGIT INCREASE IN AVERAGE SELLING PRICE, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A MID SINGLE-DIGIT DECREASE IN UNIT SALES. THE INCREASE IN AVERAGE

SELLING PRICE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO STRATEGIC PRICE INCREASES, WHILE THE DECREASE IN UNIT SALES WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY LOWER DISCOUNTS ON IN-LINE PRODUCTS COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR.

THE DECREASE IN APPAREL REVENUE FOR FISCAL 2010 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO A MID SINGLE-DIGIT DECREASE IN UNIT SALES ACROSS MOST MAJOR

CATEGORIES, WHICH MORE THAN OFFSET A LOW SINGLE-DIGIT INCREASE IN AVERAGE SELLING PRICE PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY STRATEGIC PRICE INCREASES.

EBIT FOR GREATER CHINA INCREASED AT A FASTER RATE THAN REVENUE AS A RESULT OF HIGHER GROSS MARGINS AND REDUCTIONS IN DEMAND CREATION SPENDING ATTRIBUTABLE TO COMPARISONS AGAINST HIGHER PRIOR YEAR SPENDING

AROUND THE BEIJING OLYMPICS.

MACROECONOMIC CONDITIONS IN JAPAN REMAIN DIFFICULT. ON MARCH 11, 2011, JAPAN EXPERIENCED A MAJOR EARTHQUAKE AND RESULTING TSUNAMI.

WHILE THE COMPANYS ORGANIZATION AND ASSETS IN JAPAN WERE NOT MATERIALLY DAMAGED, BUSINESS RESULTS FOR THE MONTH OF MARCH 2011 WERE SIGNIFICANTLY ERODED BY THE NATURAL DISASTER. AS WE ENTER FISCAL 2012, WE ANTICIPATE MACROECONOMIC CONDITIONS IN

JAPAN TO REMAIN DIFFICULT AS CONSUMER CONFIDENCE CONTINUES TO RECOVER.

EXCLUDING CHANGES IN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES, BOTH

FOOTWEAR AND APPAREL REVENUES IN JAPAN DECLINED, DRIVEN BY DECREASES ACROSS MOST KEY CATEGORIES. PARTIALLY OFFSETTING THE DECREASES WAS A DOUBLE-DIGIT PERCENTAGE GROWTH IN REVENUES FROM RUNNING APPAREL.

THE DECREASE IN JAPANS EBIT FOR FISCAL 2011 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER REVENUES AND HIGHER SELLING AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE AS A

PERCENTAGE OF REVENUE, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN IMPROVEMENT IN THE GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE. THE IMPROVEMENT IN THE GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY FAVORABLE YEAR-OVER-YEAR STANDARD CURRENCY RATES AND POSITIVE IMPACTS FROM FEWER

DISCOUNTS ON CLOSE-OUT SALES, WHICH MORE THAN OFFSET HIGHER PRODUCT INPUT COSTS AND INVENTORY OBSOLESCENCE EXPENSE.

FISCAL

2010 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2009

EXCLUDING CHANGES IN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES, BOTH FOOTWEAR AND APPAREL REVENUES IN JAPAN

DECLINED DURING FISCAL 2010 DUE TO DECREASES IN UNIT SALES ACROSS MOST MAJOR CATEGORIES. THE DECLINE IN REVENUES WAS REFLECTIVE OF A DIFFICULT AND HIGHLY PROMOTIONAL MARKETPLACE IN JAPAN.

FOR FISCAL 2010, THE DECREASE IN JAPANS EBIT WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER REVENUES AND HIGHER SELLING AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE,

DRIVEN BY INCREASED INVESTMENTS IN OUR DIRECT TO CONSUMER OPERATIONS, WHICH MORE THAN OFFSET IMPROVED GROSS MARGINS.

FISCAL 2011 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2010

EXCLUDING THE CHANGES IN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES, REVENUES FOR EMERGING MARKETS INCREASED 19% FOR FISCAL 2011. MOST TERRITORIES IN THE

GEOGRAPHY REPORTED DOUBLE-DIGIT REVENUE GROWTH FOR THE FISCAL YEAR, LED BY BRAZIL, ARGENTINA, MEXICO, AND KOREA.

FOR FISCAL

2011, BOTH FOOTWEAR AND APPAREL REVENUE GROWTH IN THE EMERGING MARKETS WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY STRONG DEMAND IN NEARLY ALL KEY CATEGORIES, MOST NOTABLY NIKE BRAND SPORTSWEAR AND RUNNING.

FOR FISCAL 2011, EBIT FOR EMERGING MARKETS GREW AT A FASTER RATE THAN REVENUE AS A RESULT OF HIGHER GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE, IMPROVED

LEVERAGE ON SELLING AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE AND FAVORABLE FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION. THE INCREASE IN THE GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO A HIGHER MIX OF IN-LINE PRODUCT SALES, LOWER WAREHOUSING COSTS AND FAVORABLE YEAR-OVER-YEAR

STANDARD CURRENCY RATES, WHICH MORE THAN OFFSET THE INCREASE IN PRODUCT INPUT COSTS AND HIGHER FULL-PRICE DISCOUNTS.

FISCAL 2010 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2009

EXCLUDING CHANGES IN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES, FISCAL 2010 REVENUE GROWTH FOR THE EMERGING MARKETS GEOGRAPHY WAS DRIVEN BY GROWTH IN ALL PRODUCT CATEGORIES AND ALL TERRITORIES, MOST NOTABLY BRAZIL, MEXICO

AND KOREA.

FOOTWEAR REVENUE GROWTH WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY A DOUBLE-DIGIT GROWTH IN UNIT SALES AND A MID SINGLE-DIGIT

INCREASE IN AVERAGE SELLING PRICE PER PAIR DURING FISCAL 2010, REFLECTIVE OF STRONG DEMAND FOR MOST NIKE BRAND PRODUCT CATEGORIES IN ALL MARKETS WITHIN THE GEOGRAPHY.

FOR FISCAL 2010, THE INCREASE IN EMERGING MARKETS EBIT WAS PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF REVENUE GROWTH COMBINED WITH LOWER SELLING AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE, WHICH MORE THAN OFFSET A DECREASE IN GROSS

MARGIN PERCENTAGE. THE DECREASE IN SELLING AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER OPERATING OVERHEAD EXPENSE RESULTING FROM FISCAL 2009 RESTRUCTURING ACTIVITIES. THE DECLINE IN GROSS MARGIN WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO LESS FAVORABLE

YEAR-OVER-YEAR STANDARD CURRENCY RATES COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR, WHICH MORE THAN OFFSET IMPROVED IN-LINE PRODUCT MARGINS.

GLOBAL BRAND DIVISIONS PRIMARILY REPRESENT DEMAND CREATION AND OPERATING OVERHEAD EXPENSES THAT ARE

CENTRALLY MANAGED FOR THE NIKE BRAND. REVENUES FOR THE GLOBAL BRAND DIVISIONS ARE ATTRIBUTABLE TO NIKE BRAND LICENSING BUSINESSES THAT ARE NOT PART OF A GEOGRAPHIC OPERATING SEGMENT.

FISCAL 2011 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2010

FOR FISCAL 2011, THE INCREASE IN GLOBAL BRAND DIVISION EXPENSE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO AN INCREASE IN BOTH OPERATING OVERHEAD AND CENTRALLY MANAGED DEMAND CREATION EXPENSE. THE INCREASE IN OPERATING OVERHEAD

EXPENSE WAS MAINLY DRIVEN BY INCREASED INVESTMENTS IN OUR DIRECT TO CONSUMER INFRASTRUCTURE ALONG WITH HIGHER WAGES AND TRAVEL EXPENSE. THE INCREASE IN DEMAND CREATION EXPENSE WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY A HIGHER LEVEL OF BRAND EVENT SPENDING AROUND THE

WORLD CUP AND WORLD BASKETBALL FESTIVAL IN THE FIRST HALF OF FISCAL 2011, AS WELL AS INCREASED INVESTMENTS IN SPORTS MARKETING.

FISCAL 2010 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2009

FOR FISCAL 2010, THE INCREASE IN GLOBAL BRAND DIVISION EXPENSE WAS LARGELY DUE TO INCREASES IN CENTRALLY MANAGED DEMAND CREATION EXPENSE AND PERFORMANCE-BASED COMPENSATION, WHICH MORE THAN OFFSET AN

INCREASE IN LICENSING REVENUES. THE INCREASE IN DEMAND CREATION EXPENSE WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY THE CENTRALIZATION OF CERTAIN MARKETING PRODUCTION COSTS.

FISCAL 2011 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2010

OUR OTHER BUSINESSES ARE COMPRISED OF OUR AFFILIATE BRANDS; COLE HAAN, CONVERSE, HURLEY AND UMBRO; AND NIKE GOLF. THE REVENUE GROWTH AT

CONVERSE WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY INCREASED LICENSING REVENUE IN CHINA, AS

38

TABLE OF CONTENTS

WELL AS INCREASED SALES IN THE U.K. AS WE TRANSITIONED THAT MARKET TO A CONVERSE OWNED DISTRIBUTION MODEL. REVENUES FOR COLE HAAN INCREASED 12%, DRIVEN BY DOUBLE-DIGIT PERCENTAGE GROWTH IN OUR

WHOLESALE OPERATIONS AS WELL AS HIGH SINGLE-DIGIT PERCENTAGE GROWTH IN OUR DIRECT TO CONSUMER OPERATIONS. REVENUES DECLINED AT NIKE GOLF, WHERE WE EXPERIENCED SIGNIFICANT EROSION IN OUR JAPAN BUSINESS FOLLOWING THE EARTHQUAKE AND TSUNAMI IN MARCH

2011.

FOR FISCAL 2011, EBIT FOR OUR OTHER BUSINESSES GREW AT A FASTER RATE THAN REVENUES, PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF MORE

FAVORABLE FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE IMPACTS. THE GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE REMAINED RELATIVELY FLAT FOR FISCAL 2011, AS THE FAVORABLE IMPACT FROM IMPROVED PRODUCT MIX WAS OFFSET BY A LOWER MIX OF LICENSEE REVENUES. SELLING AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE

AS A PERCENTAGE OF REVENUES REMAINED RELATIVELY FLAT FOR FISCAL 2011.

FISCAL 2010 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2009

FOR FISCAL 2010, THE INCREASE IN OTHER BUSINESSES REVENUE WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY REVENUE GROWTH AT CONVERSE, UMBRO AND HURLEY,

WHICH MORE THAN OFFSET THE DECLINES AT NIKE GOLF AND COLE HAAN DUE TO REDUCTIONS IN CONSUMER DISCRETIONARY SPENDING IN THEIR RESPECTIVE MARKETS.

IN FISCAL 2009, EBIT FOR OUR OTHER BUSINESSES INCLUDED A $401 MILLION PRE-TAX NON-CASH CHARGE RELATING TO THE IMPAIRMENT OF GOODWILL, INTANGIBLE AND OTHER ASSETS OF UMBRO. EXCLUDING THIS IMPAIRMENT

CHARGE, EBIT FOR OUR OTHER BUSINESSES WOULD HAVE INCREASED 43%, AS A RESULT OF HIGHER REVENUES, IMPROVED GROSS MARGINS ACROSS MOST BUSINESSES, AND LOWER DEMAND CREATION SPENDING.

CORPORATE CONSISTS LARGELY OF UNALLOCATED GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES, WHICH INCLUDES EXPENSES

ASSOCIATED WITH CENTRALLY MANAGED DEPARTMENTS, DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION RELATED TO OUR CORPORATE HEADQUARTERS, UNALLOCATED INSURANCE, BENEFIT AND COMPENSATION PROGRAMS, INCLUDING STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION, CERTAIN FOREIGN CURRENCY GAINS AND

LOSSES, INCLUDING CERTAIN HEDGE GAINS AND LOSSES, CORPORATE ELIMINATIONS AND OTHER ITEMS.

CORPORATE REVENUES PRIMARILY

CONSIST OF (1) FOREIGN CURRENCY HEDGE GAINS AND LOSSES RELATED TO REVENUES GENERATED BY ENTITIES WITHIN THE NIKE BRAND GEOGRAPHIC OPERATING SEGMENTS BUT MANAGED THROUGH OUR CENTRAL FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK MANAGEMENT PROGRAM AND (2) FOREIGN

CURRENCY GAINS AND LOSSES RESULTING FROM THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ACTUAL FOREIGN CURRENCY RATES AND STANDARD RATES ASSIGNED TO THESE ENTITIES, WHICH ARE USED TO RECORD ANY NON-FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY REVENUES INTO THE ENTITYS FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY.

IN ADDITION TO THE FOREIGN CURRENCY GAINS AND LOSSES RECOGNIZED IN CORPORATE REVENUES, FOREIGN CURRENCY RESULTS INCLUDE ALL

OTHER FOREIGN CURRENCY HEDGE RESULTS GENERATED THROUGH OUR CENTRALLY MANAGED FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK MANAGEMENT PROGRAM, OTHER CONVERSION GAINS AND LOSSES ARISING FROM RE-MEASUREMENT OF MONETARY ASSETS AND LIABILITIES IN NON-FUNCTIONAL CURRENCIES, AND

GAINS AND LOSSES RESULTING FROM THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ACTUAL FOREIGN CURRENCY RATES AND STANDARD RATES ASSIGNED TO EACH ENTITY IN NIKE BRAND GEOGRAPHIC OPERATING SEGMENTS, WHICH ARE USED TO RECORD ANY NON-FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY PRODUCT PURCHASES INTO

THE ENTITYS FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY. PRIOR TO FISCAL 2010, ALL FOREIGN CURRENCY RESULTS, INCLUDING HEDGE RESULTS AND OTHER CONVERSION GAINS AND LOSSES, GENERATED BY THE WESTERN EUROPE AND CENTRAL & EASTERN EUROPE GEOGRAPHIES WERE RECORDED IN

THEIR RESPECTIVE GEOGRAPHIC RESULTS.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

FISCAL 2011 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2010

FOR FISCAL 2011, THE DECREASE IN CORPORATE EXPENSE WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY YEAR-OVER-YEAR NET FOREIGN CURRENCY GAINS GENERATED BY OUR

CENTRALLY MANAGED FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK MANAGEMENT PROGRAM. ALSO CONTRIBUTING TO THE DECREASE IN CORPORATE EXPENSE FOR FISCAL 2011 WAS A $54 MILLION YEAR-OVER-YEAR REDUCTION IN STOCK OPTIONS EXPENSE PRIMARILY DUE TO A CHANGE IN ACCELERATED VESTING

PROVISIONS THAT TOOK EFFECT IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2011 AND A LOWER ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE FOR STOCK OPTIONS GRANTED IN THE CURRENT YEAR. THESE BENEFITS MORE THAN OFFSET AN INCREASE IN CORPORATE OPERATING OVERHEAD EXPENSES, PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY

HIGHER WAGE-RELATED EXPENSE.

FISCAL 2010 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2009

IN FISCAL 2009, RESULTS FOR CORPORATE INCLUDED A PRE-TAX RESTRUCTURING CHARGE OF $195 MILLION. EXCLUDING THIS RESTRUCTURING CHARGE, LOSS

BEFORE INTEREST AND TAXES FOR CORPORATE WOULD HAVE INCREASED BY 18% FOR FISCAL 2010, PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY AN INCREASE IN PERFORMANCE-BASED COMPENSATION.

FOREIGN CURRENCY EXPOSURES AND HEDGING PRACTICES

OVERVIEW

AS A GLOBAL COMPANY WITH SIGNIFICANT OPERATIONS OUTSIDE THE U.S., IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS WE ARE EXPOSED TO

RISK ARISING FROM CHANGES IN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES. FOREIGN CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS AFFECT THE RECORDING OF TRANSACTIONS, SUCH AS SALES, PURCHASES AND INTERCOMPANY TRANSACTIONS DENOMINATED IN NON-FUNCTIONAL CURRENCIES, AND THE TRANSLATION INTO U.S.

DOLLARS OF FOREIGN CURRENCY DENOMINATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL POSITION AND CASH FLOWS. OUR FOREIGN CURRENCY EXPOSURES ARE DUE PRIMARILY TO U.S. DOLLAR TRANSACTIONS AT WHOLLY-OWNED FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES, AS WELL AS TRANSACTIONS AND

TRANSLATION OF RESULTS DENOMINATED IN EUROS, BRITISH POUNDS, CHINESE RENMINBI AND JAPANESE YEN.

OUR FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK

MANAGEMENT PROGRAM IS INTENDED TO MINIMIZE BOTH THE POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE EFFECTS OF CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS ON OUR REPORTED CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL POSITION AND CASH FLOWS. THIS ALSO HAS THE EFFECT OF DELAYING THE MAJORITY OF

THE IMPACT OF CURRENT MARKET RATES ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, THE LENGTH OF THE DELAY IS DEPENDENT UPON HEDGE HORIZONS. WE MANAGE GLOBAL FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK CENTRALLY ON A PORTFOLIO BASIS, TO ADDRESS THOSE RISKS THAT ARE MATERIAL TO

NIKE, INC. ON A CONSOLIDATED BASIS. WE MANAGE THESE EXPOSURES BY TAKING ADVANTAGE OF NATURAL OFFSETS AND CURRENCY CORRELATIONS THAT EXIST WITHIN THE PORTFOLIO AND WHERE PRACTICAL, BY HEDGING A PORTION OF CERTAIN REMAINING MATERIAL EXPOSURES, USING

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS SUCH AS FORWARD CONTRACTS AND OPTIONS. OUR HEDGING POLICY IS DESIGNED TO PARTIALLY OR ENTIRELY OFFSET CHANGES IN THE UNDERLYING EXPOSURES BEING HEDGED. WE DO NOT HOLD OR ISSUE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS FOR TRADING PURPOSES.

TRANSACTIONAL EXPOSURES

WE TRANSACT BUSINESS IN VARIOUS CURRENCIES AND HAVE SIGNIFICANT REVENUES AND COSTS DENOMINATED IN CURRENCIES OTHER THAN THE FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY OF THE RELEVANT SUBSIDIARY, BOTH OF WHICH SUBJECT US TO

FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK. OUR MOST SIGNIFICANT TRANSACTIONAL FOREIGN CURRENCY EXPOSURES ARE.

1.

INVENTORY PURCHASES  MOST OF OUR INVENTORY PURCHASES AROUND THE WORLD ARE DENOMINATED IN U.S. DOLLARS. THIS GENERATES FOREIGN CURRENCY EXPOSURES FOR ALL

SUBSIDIARIES WITH A FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY OTHER THAN THE U.S. DOLLAR. A WEAKER U.S. DOLLAR REDUCES THE INVENTORY COST IN THE PURCHASING SUBSIDIARYS FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY WHEREAS A STRONGER U.S. DOLLAR INCREASES THE INVENTORY COST.

2.

NON-FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY REVENUES  A PORTION OF OUR WESTERN EUROPE GEOGRAPHY REVENUES ARE EARNED IN CURRENCIES OTHER THAN THE EURO (E.G. BRITISH POUND), BUT ARE

RECOGNIZED AT A SUBSIDIARY THAT USES THE EURO AS ITS FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY, GENERATING FOREIGN CURRENCY EXPOSURE.

3.

OTHER REVENUES AND COSTS  NON-FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY REVENUES AND COSTS, SUCH AS ENDORSEMENT CONTRACTS, INTERCOMPANY ROYALTIES AND OTHER PAYMENTS, GENERATE FOREIGN

CURRENCY RISK TO A LESSER EXTENT.

40

TABLE OF CONTENTS

4.

NON-FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY MONETARY ASSETS AND LIABILITIES  OUR GLOBAL SUBSIDIARIES HAVE VARIOUS ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, PRIMARILY RECEIVABLES AND PAYABLES

DENOMINATED IN CURRENCIES OTHER THAN THEIR FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY. THESE BALANCE SHEET ITEMS ARE SUBJECT TO RE-MEASUREMENT, WHICH MAY CREATE FLUCTUATIONS IN OTHER (INCOME), NET WITHIN OUR CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

MANAGING TRANSACTIONAL EXPOSURES

TRANSACTIONAL EXPOSURES ARE MANAGED ON A PORTFOLIO BASIS WITHIN OUR FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK MANAGEMENT PROGRAM. AS OF MAY 31, 2011, WE USE CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS AND OPTIONS WITH MATURITIES UP TO

15 MONTHS TO HEDGE THE EFFECT OF EXCHANGE RATE FLUCTUATIONS ON PROBABLE FORECASTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS, INCLUDING NON-FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY REVENUES AND EXPENSES. THESE ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AS CASH FLOW HEDGES IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

FOR DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING. THE FAIR VALUE OF THESE INSTRUMENTS AT MAY 31, 2011 AND 2010 WAS $28 MILLION AND $206 MILLION IN ASSETS AND $136 MILLION AND $25 MILLION IN LIABILITIES, RESPECTIVELY. THE EFFECTIVE PORTION OF THE CHANGES IN FAIR

VALUE OF THESE INSTRUMENTS IS REPORTED IN OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (OCI), A COMPONENT OF SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY, AND RECLASSIFIED INTO EARNINGS IN THE SAME FINANCIAL STATEMENT LINE ITEM AND IN THE SAME PERIOD OR PERIODS DURING WHICH

THE RELATED HEDGED TRANSACTIONS AFFECT EARNINGS. THE INEFFECTIVE PORTION IS IMMEDIATELY RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS AS A COMPONENT OF OTHER (INCOME), NET. INEFFECTIVENESS WAS NOT MATERIAL FOR THE YEARS ENDED MAY 31, 2011, 2010, AND 2009.

CERTAIN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS USED TO MANAGE FOREIGN EXCHANGE EXPOSURE OF NON-FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY MONETARY ASSETS AND LIABILITIES

SUBJECT TO RE-MEASUREMENT ARE NOT DESIGNATED AS HEDGES UNDER THE ACCOUNTING STANDARDS FOR DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING. IN THESE CASES, THE CHANGE IN VALUE OF THE INSTRUMENTS IS IMMEDIATELY RECOGNIZED IN OTHER (INCOME), NET AND IS INTENDED TO OFFSET THE

FOREIGN CURRENCY IMPACT OF THE RE-MEASUREMENT OF THE RELATED NON-FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY ASSET OR LIABILITY BEING HEDGED. THE FAIR VALUE OF THESE INSTRUMENTS AT MAY 31, 2011 AND 2010 WAS $9 MILLION AND $104 MILLION IN ASSETS AND $17 MILLION AND

$140 MILLION IN LIABILITIES, RESPECTIVELY.

REFER TO NOTE 17  RISK MANAGEMENT AND DERIVATIVES IN THE ACCOMPANYING NOTES

TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR ADDITIONAL QUANTITATIVE DETAIL.

TRANSLATIONAL EXPOSURES

SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES OPERATE IN FUNCTIONAL CURRENCIES OTHER THAN THE U.S. DOLLAR.

FLUCTUATIONS IN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES CREATE VOLATILITY IN OUR REPORTED RESULTS AS WE ARE REQUIRED TO TRANSLATE THE BALANCE SHEETS AND OPERATIONAL RESULTS OF THESE FOREIGN CURRENCY DENOMINATED SUBSIDIARIES INTO U.S. DOLLARS FOR CONSOLIDATED

REPORTING. THE TRANSLATION OF FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES NON-U.S. DOLLAR BALANCE SHEETS INTO U.S. DOLLARS FOR CONSOLIDATED REPORTING RESULTS IN A CUMULATIVE TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENT TO OCI WITHIN SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY. IN PREPARING OUR CONSOLIDATED

STATEMENTS OF INCOME, FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATE FLUCTUATIONS IMPACT OUR OPERATING RESULTS AS THE REVENUES AND EXPENSES OF OUR FOREIGN OPERATIONS ARE TRANSLATED INTO U.S. DOLLARS. IN TRANSLATION, A WEAKER U.S. DOLLAR IN RELATION TO FOREIGN

FUNCTIONAL CURRENCIES BENEFITS OUR CONSOLIDATED EARNINGS WHEREAS A STRONGER U.S. DOLLAR REDUCES OUR CONSOLIDATED EARNINGS. THE IMPACT OF FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATE FLUCTUATIONS ON THE TRANSLATION OF OUR CONSOLIDATED REVENUES AND INCOME BEFORE INCOME

TAXES WAS A NET TRANSLATION BENEFIT (DETRIMENT) OF APPROXIMATELY ($28) MILLION AND ($16) MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, FOR THE YEAR ENDED MAY 31, 2011 AND APPROXIMATELY $147 MILLION AND $33 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, FOR THE YEAR ENDED MAY 31, 2010.

MANAGING TRANSLATIONAL EXPOSURES

TO MINIMIZE THE IMPACT OF TRANSLATING FOREIGN CURRENCY DENOMINATED REVENUES AND EXPENSES INTO U.S. DOLLARS FOR CONSOLIDATED REPORTING, CERTAIN FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES USE EXCESS CASH TO PURCHASE U.S. DOLLAR

DENOMINATED AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE INVESTMENTS. THE VARIABLE FUTURE CASH FLOWS ASSOCIATED WITH THE PURCHASE AND SUBSEQUENT SALE OF THESE U.S. DOLLAR DENOMINATED SECURITIES AT NON-U.S. DOLLAR FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY SUBSIDIARIES CREATES A FOREIGN CURRENCY

EXPOSURE THAT QUALIFIES FOR HEDGE ACCOUNTING UNDER THE ACCOUNTING STANDARDS FOR DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING. WE UTILIZE FORWARD CONTRACTS AND OPTIONS TO PARTIALLY, OR ENTIRELY, HEDGE THE VARIABILITY OF

41

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE FORECASTED FUTURE PURCHASES AND SALES OF THESE U.S. DOLLAR INVESTMENTS. THIS HAS THE EFFECT OF PARTIALLY OFFSETTING THE YEAR-OVER-YEAR FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION IMPACT ON NET EARNINGS IN

THE PERIOD THE INVESTMENTS ARE SOLD. HEDGES OF AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE INVESTMENTS ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AS CASH FLOW HEDGES. THE FAIR VALUE OF INSTRUMENTS USED IN THIS MANNER AT MAY 31, 2011 WAS $1 MILLION IN ASSETS AND $21 MILLION IN LIABILITIES. AT

MAY 31, 2010, THE FAIR VALUE WAS $78 MILLION IN ASSETS. THE EFFECTIVE PORTION OF THE CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE OF THESE INSTRUMENTS IS REPORTED IN OCI AND RECLASSIFIED INTO EARNINGS IN OTHER (INCOME), NET IN THE PERIOD DURING WHICH THE HEDGED

AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE INVESTMENT IS SOLD AND AFFECTS EARNINGS. ANY INEFFECTIVE PORTION, WHICH WAS NOT MATERIAL FOR ANY PERIOD PRESENTED, IS IMMEDIATELY RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS AS A COMPONENT OF OTHER (INCOME), NET.

WE ESTIMATE THAT THE COMBINATION OF TRANSLATION OF FOREIGN CURRENCY-DENOMINATED PROFITS FROM OUR INTERNATIONAL BUSINESSES AND THE

YEAR-OVER-YEAR CHANGE IN FOREIGN CURRENCY RELATED NET GAINS INCLUDED IN OTHER (INCOME), NET HAD NET (DETRIMENT) BENEFIT ON OUR INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES OF APPROXIMATELY $(33) MILLION AND $34 MILLION FOR THE YEARS ENDED MAY 31, 2011 AND 2010.

REFER TO NOTE 17  RISK MANAGEMENT AND DERIVATIVES IN THE ACCOMPANYING NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

FOR ADDITIONAL QUANTITATIVE DETAIL.

NET INVESTMENTS IN FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES

WE ARE ALSO EXPOSED TO THE IMPACT OF FOREIGN EXCHANGE FLUCTUATIONS ON OUR INVESTMENTS IN WHOLLY-OWNED FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES DENOMINATED IN

A CURRENCY OTHER THAN THE U.S. DOLLAR, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT THE U.S. DOLLAR VALUE OF THESE INVESTMENTS AND THEREFORE THE VALUE OF FUTURE REPATRIATED EARNINGS. WE HEDGE CERTAIN NET INVESTMENT POSITIONS IN EURO-FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY FOREIGN

SUBSIDIARIES TO MITIGATE THE EFFECTS OF FOREIGN EXCHANGE FLUCTUATIONS ON NET INVESTMENTS WITH THE EFFECT OF PRESERVING THE VALUE OF FUTURE REPATRIATED EARNINGS. IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE ACCOUNTING STANDARDS FOR DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING, THE EFFECTIVE

PORTION OF THE CHANGE IN FAIR VALUE OF THE FORWARD CONTRACTS DESIGNATED AS NET INVESTMENT HEDGES IS RECORDED IN THE CUMULATIVE TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENT COMPONENT OF ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME. ANY INEFFECTIVE PORTION, WHICH WAS NOT

MATERIAL FOR ANY PERIOD PRESENTED, IS IMMEDIATELY RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS AS A COMPONENT OF OTHER (INCOME), NET. TO MINIMIZE CREDIT RISK, WE HAVE STRUCTURED THESE NET INVESTMENT HEDGES TO BE GENERALLY LESS THAN SIX MONTHS IN DURATION. UPON MATURITY,

THE HEDGES ARE SETTLED BASED ON THE CURRENT FAIR VALUE OF THE FORWARD CONTRACTS WITH THE REALIZED GAIN OR LOSS REMAINING IN OCI; CONCURRENT WITH SETTLEMENT, WE ENTER INTO NEW FORWARD CONTRACTS AT THE CURRENT MARKET RATE. THE FAIR VALUE OF

OUTSTANDING NET INVESTMENT HEDGES AT MAY 31, 2011 WAS $23 MILLION IN LIABILITIES. AT MAY 31, 2010, THE FAIR VALUE WAS $32 MILLION IN ASSETS. CASH FLOWS FROM NET INVESTMENT HEDGE SETTLEMENTS TOTALED ($23) MILLION AND $5 MILLION IN THE YEARS

ENDED MAY 31, 2011 AND 2010, RESPECTIVELY.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

CASH FLOW ACTIVITY

CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATIONS WAS $1.8 BILLION FOR FISCAL 2011 COMPARED TO $3.2 BILLION FOR FISCAL 2010. OUR PRIMARY SOURCE OF OPERATING CASH FLOW FOR FISCAL 2011 WAS NET INCOME OF $2.1 BILLION. OUR WORKING

CAPITAL WAS A NET CASH OUTFLOW OF $708 MILLION FOR FISCAL 2011 AS COMPARED TO A POSITIVE NET CASH INFLOW OF $694 MILLION FOR FISCAL 2010. OUR INVESTMENTS IN WORKING CAPITAL INCREASED PRIMARILY DUE TO AN INCREASE IN INVENTORY AND HIGHER ACCOUNTS

RECEIVABLE. INVENTORY AT THE END OF FISCAL 2011 INCREASED 33% COMPARED TO FISCAL 2010, PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY A 15% INCREASE IN FUTURES ORDERS, GROWTH IN REPLENISHMENT PROGRAMS FOR HIGH-TURNOVER STYLES, EARLY PURCHASES OF KEY SEASONAL ITEMS WITH LONGER

PRODUCTION LEAD TIMES AS WELL AS THE GROWTH OF DIRECT TO CONSUMER OPERATIONS. CHANGES IN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES AND HIGHER PRODUCT COSTS ALSO CONTRIBUTED TO THE INCREASE IN DOLLAR INVENTORY. THE INCREASE IN ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE WAS MAINLY

ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE INCREASE IN REVENUES DURING FISCAL 2011.

CASH USED BY INVESTING ACTIVITIES WAS $1.0 BILLION DURING FISCAL

2011, COMPARED TO $1.3 BILLION FOR FISCAL 2010. THE YEAR-OVER-YEAR DECREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER NET PURCHASES OF SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS. NET PURCHASES OF SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS WERE $537 MILLION (NET OF SALES AND MATURITIES) IN FISCAL

2011 COMPARED TO $937 MILLION DURING FISCAL 2010.

42

TABLE OF CONTENTS

CASH USED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES WAS $2.0 BILLION FOR FISCAL 2011 COMPARED TO $1.1 BILLION

USED IN FISCAL 2010. THE INCREASE IN CASH USED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO AN INCREASE IN SHARE REPURCHASES AND DIVIDENDS PAID, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN NOTES PAYABLE.

IN FISCAL 2011, WE PURCHASED 23.8 MILLION SHARES OF NIKES CLASS B COMMON STOCK FOR $1.9 BILLION. THESE REPURCHASES WERE MADE

UNDER THE FOUR-YEAR, $5 BILLION PROGRAM APPROVED BY OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS WHICH COMMENCED IN DECEMBER 2009 AND AS OF THE END OF FISCAL 2011, WE HAVE REPURCHASED 30.4 MILLION SHARES FOR $2.3 BILLION UNDER THIS PROGRAM. WE CONTINUE TO EXPECT

FUNDING OF SHARE REPURCHASES WILL COME FROM OPERATING CASH FLOW, EXCESS CASH, AND/OR DEBT. THE TIMING AND THE AMOUNT OF SHARES PURCHASED WILL BE DICTATED BY OUR CAPITAL NEEDS AND STOCK MARKET CONDITIONS.

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS

IN CONNECTION WITH VARIOUS CONTRACTS AND AGREEMENTS, WE PROVIDE ROUTINE INDEMNIFICATIONS RELATING TO THE ENFORCEABILITY OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS, COVERAGE FOR LEGAL ISSUES THAT ARISE AND OTHER

ITEMS WHERE WE ARE ACTING AS THE GUARANTOR. CURRENTLY, WE HAVE SEVERAL SUCH AGREEMENTS IN PLACE. HOWEVER, BASED ON OUR HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND THE ESTIMATED PROBABILITY OF FUTURE LOSS, WE HAVE DETERMINED THAT THE FAIR VALUE OF SUCH

INDEMNIFICATIONS IS NOT MATERIAL TO OUR FINANCIAL POSITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

THE AMOUNTS LISTED FOR ENDORSEMENT CONTRACTS REPRESENT APPROXIMATE AMOUNTS OF BASE COMPENSATION AND MINIMUM GUARANTEED ROYALTY FEES WE ARE OBLIGATED TO

PAY ATHLETE AND SPORT TEAM ENDORSERS OF OUR PRODUCTS. ACTUAL PAYMENTS UNDER SOME CONTRACTS MAY BE HIGHER THAN THE AMOUNTS LISTED AS THESE CONTRACTS PROVIDE FOR BONUSES TO BE PAID TO THE ENDORSERS BASED UPON ATHLETIC ACHIEVEMENTS AND/OR ROYALTIES ON

PRODUCT SALES IN FUTURE PERIODS. ACTUAL PAYMENTS UNDER SOME CONTRACTS MAY ALSO BE LOWER AS THESE CONTRACTS INCLUDE PROVISIONS FOR REDUCED PAYMENTS IF ATHLETIC PERFORMANCE DECLINES IN FUTURE PERIODS.

IN ADDITION TO THE CASH PAYMENTS, WE ARE OBLIGATED TO FURNISH OUR ENDORSERS WITH NIKE PRODUCT FOR THEIR USE. IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO

DETERMINE HOW MUCH WE WILL SPEND ON THIS PRODUCT ON AN ANNUAL BASIS AS THE CONTRACTS GENERALLY DO NOT STIPULATE A SPECIFIC AMOUNT OF CASH TO BE SPENT ON THE PRODUCT. THE AMOUNT OF PRODUCT PROVIDED TO THE ENDORSERS WILL DEPEND ON MANY FACTORS

INCLUDING GENERAL PLAYING CONDITIONS, THE NUMBER OF SPORTING EVENTS IN WHICH THEY PARTICIPATE, AND OUR OWN DECISIONS REGARDING PRODUCT AND MARKETING INITIATIVES. IN ADDITION, THE COSTS TO DESIGN, DEVELOP, SOURCE, AND PURCHASE THE PRODUCTS FURNISHED

TO THE ENDORSERS ARE INCURRED OVER A PERIOD OF TIME AND ARE NOT NECESSARILY TRACKED SEPARATELY FROM SIMILAR COSTS INCURRED FOR PRODUCTS SOLD TO CUSTOMERS.

MOODYS INVESTOR SERVICES, RESPECTIVELY, THE INTEREST RATE CHARGED ON ANY OUTSTANDING BORROWINGS WOULD BE THE PREVAILING LONDON INTERBANK OFFER RATE (LIBOR) PLUS 0.15%. THE FACILITY FEE IS 0.05% OF THE TOTAL COMMITMENT.

IF OUR LONG-TERM DEBT RATING WERE TO DECLINE, THE FACILITY FEE AND INTEREST RATE UNDER OUR COMMITTED CREDIT FACILITY WOULD INCREASE.

CONVERSELY, IF OUR LONG-TERM DEBT RATING WERE TO IMPROVE, THE FACILITY FEE AND INTEREST RATE WOULD DECREASE. CHANGES IN OUR LONG-TERM DEBT RATING WOULD NOT TRIGGER ACCELERATION OF MATURITY OF ANY THEN OUTSTANDING BORROWINGS OR ANY FUTURE BORROWINGS

UNDER THE COMMITTED CREDIT FACILITY. UNDER THIS COMMITTED CREDIT FACILITY, WE HAVE AGREED TO VARIOUS COVENANTS. THESE COVENANTS INCLUDE LIMITS ON OUR DISPOSAL OF FIXED ASSETS AND THE AMOUNT OF DEBT SECURED BY LIENS WE MAY INCUR AS WELL AS A MINIMUM

CAPITALIZATION RATIO. IN THE EVENT WE WERE TO HAVE ANY BORROWINGS OUTSTANDING UNDER THIS FACILITY, FAILED TO MEET ANY COVENANT, AND WERE UNABLE TO OBTAIN A WAIVER FROM A MAJORITY OF THE BANKS, ANY BORROWINGS WOULD BECOME IMMEDIATELY DUE AND PAYABLE.

AS OF MAY 31, 2011, WE WERE IN FULL COMPLIANCE WITH EACH OF THESE COVENANTS AND BELIEVE IT IS UNLIKELY WE WILL FAIL TO MEET ANY OF THESE COVENANTS IN THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE.

LIQUIDITY IS ALSO PROVIDED BY OUR $1 BILLION COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAM. AS OF AND FOR THE

YEAR ENDED MAY 31, 2011, NO AMOUNTS WERE OUTSTANDING UNDER THIS PROGRAM. WE CURRENTLY HAVE SHORT-TERM DEBT RATINGS OF A1 AND P1 FROM STANDARD AND POORS CORPORATION AND MOODYS INVESTOR SERVICES, RESPECTIVELY.

AS OF MAY 31, 2011, WE HAD CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND SHORT TERM INVESTMENTS TOTALING $4.5 BILLION, INCLUDING AMOUNTS HELD IN THE

U.S. AND FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS. CASH EQUIVALENTS AND SHORT TERM INVESTMENTS CONSIST PRIMARILY OF DEPOSITS HELD AT MAJOR BANKS, MONEY MARKET FUNDS, TIER-1 COMMERCIAL PAPER, CORPORATE NOTES, U.S. TREASURY OBLIGATIONS, U.S. GOVERNMENT AGENCY

OBLIGATIONS AND GOVERNMENT SPONSORED ENTERPRISE OBLIGATIONS, AND OTHER INVESTMENT GRADE FIXED INCOME SECURITIES. OUR FIXED INCOME INVESTMENTS ARE EXPOSED TO BOTH CREDIT AND INTEREST RATE RISK. ALL OF OUR INVESTMENTS ARE INVESTMENT GRADE TO

MINIMIZE OUR CREDIT RISK. WHILE INDIVIDUAL SECURITIES HAVE VARYING DURATIONS, THE AVERAGE DURATION OF OUR ENTIRE CASH EQUIVALENTS AND SHORT TERM INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO IS LESS THAN 120 DAYS AS OF MAY 31, 2011.

DESPITE RECENT UNCERTAINTIES IN THE FINANCIAL MARKETS, TO DATE WE HAVE NOT EXPERIENCED DIFFICULTY ACCESSING THE CREDIT MARKETS OR

INCURRED HIGHER INTEREST COSTS. FUTURE VOLATILITY IN THE CAPITAL MARKETS, HOWEVER, MAY INCREASE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH ISSUING COMMERCIAL PAPER OR OTHER DEBT INSTRUMENTS OR AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO ACCESS THOSE MARKETS. WE UTILIZE A VARIETY OF TAX

PLANNING AND FINANCING STRATEGIES IN AN EFFORT TO MANAGE OUR WORLDWIDE CASH AND DEPLOY FUNDS TO LOCATIONS WHERE IT IS NEEDED. WE BELIEVE THAT EXISTING CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS, SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS AND CASH GENERATED BY OPERATIONS, TOGETHER

WITH ACCESS TO EXTERNAL SOURCES OF FUNDS AS DESCRIBED ABOVE, WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO MEET OUR DOMESTIC AND FOREIGN CAPITAL NEEDS IN THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE.

RECENTLY ADOPTED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

IN JANUARY 2010, THE FINANCIAL

ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD (FASB) ISSUED GUIDANCE TO AMEND THE DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS RELATED TO RECURRING AND NONRECURRING FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS. THE GUIDANCE REQUIRES ADDITIONAL DISCLOSURES ABOUT THE DIFFERENT CLASSES OF ASSETS AND

LIABILITIES MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE, THE VALUATION TECHNIQUES AND INPUTS USED, THE ACTIVITY IN LEVEL 3 FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS, AND THE TRANSFERS BETWEEN LEVELS 1, 2, AND 3 OF THE FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT HIERARCHY. THIS GUIDANCE BECAME EFFECTIVE FOR

US BEGINNING MARCH 1, 2010, EXCEPT FOR DISCLOSURES RELATING TO PURCHASES, SALES, ISSUANCES AND SETTLEMENTS OF LEVEL 3 ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, WHICH WILL BE EFFECTIVE FOR US BEGINNING JUNE 1, 2011. AS THIS GUIDANCE ONLY REQUIRES EXPANDED

DISCLOSURES, THE ADOPTION DID NOT AND WILL NOT IMPACT OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL POSITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

IN JUNE

2009, THE FASB ISSUED A NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARD THAT REVISED THE GUIDANCE FOR THE CONSOLIDATION OF VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES (VIE). THIS NEW GUIDANCE REQUIRES A QUALITATIVE APPROACH TO IDENTIFYING A CONTROLLING FINANCIAL INTEREST IN A

VIE, AND REQUIRES AN ONGOING ASSESSMENT OF WHETHER AN ENTITY IS A VIE AND WHETHER AN INTEREST IN A VIE MAKES THE HOLDER THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY OF THE VIE. THIS GUIDANCE BECAME EFFECTIVE FOR US BEGINNING JUNE 1, 2010. THE ADOPTION OF THIS

GUIDANCE DID NOT HAVE AN IMPACT ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL POSITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

IN JUNE 2011, THE FASB ISSUED NEW GUIDANCE ON THE PRESENTATION OF COMPREHENSIVE INCOME. THIS NEW GUIDANCE REQUIRES THE COMPONENTS OF NET

INCOME AND OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME TO BE EITHER PRESENTED IN ONE CONTINUOUS STATEMENT, REFERRED TO AS THE STATEMENT OF COMPREHENSIVE INCOME, OR IN TWO SEPARATE, BUT CONSECUTIVE STATEMENTS. THIS NEW GUIDANCE ELIMINATES THE CURRENT OPTION TO REPORT

OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME AND ITS COMPONENTS IN THE STATEMENT OF SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY. WHILE THE NEW GUIDANCE CHANGES THE PRESENTATION OF COMPREHENSIVE INCOME, THERE ARE NO CHANGES TO THE COMPONENTS THAT ARE RECOGNIZED IN NET INCOME OR OTHER

COMPREHENSIVE INCOME UNDER CURRENT ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE. THIS NEW GUIDANCE IS EFFECTIVE FOR US BEGINNING JUNE 1, 2012. AS THIS GUIDANCE ONLY AMENDS THE PRESENTATION OF THE COMPONENTS OF COMPREHENSIVE INCOME, THE ADOPTION WILL NOT HAVE AN IMPACT

ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL POSITIONS OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

IN APRIL 2011, THE FASB ISSUED NEW GUIDANCE TO ACHIEVE

COMMON FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT AND DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS BETWEEN U.S. GAAP AND INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL REPORTING STANDARDS. THIS NEW GUIDANCE, WHICH IS EFFECTIVE FOR US BEGINNING JUNE 1, 2012, AMENDS CURRENT U.S. GAAP FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT

AND DISCLOSURE GUIDANCE TO INCLUDE INCREASED TRANSPARENCY AROUND VALUATION INPUTS AND INVESTMENT CATEGORIZATION. WE DO NOT EXPECT THE ADOPTION WILL HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL POSITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

IN OCTOBER 2009, THE FASB ISSUED NEW STANDARDS THAT REVISED THE GUIDANCE FOR REVENUE RECOGNITION WITH MULTIPLE DELIVERABLES. THESE

NEW STANDARDS IMPACT THE DETERMINATION OF WHEN THE INDIVIDUAL DELIVERABLES INCLUDED IN A MULTIPLE-ELEMENT ARRANGEMENT MAY BE TREATED AS SEPARATE UNITS OF ACCOUNTING. ADDITIONALLY, THESE NEW STANDARDS MODIFY THE MANNER IN WHICH THE TRANSACTION

CONSIDERATION IS ALLOCATED ACROSS THE SEPARATELY IDENTIFIED DELIVERABLES BY NO LONGER PERMITTING THE RESIDUAL METHOD OF ALLOCATING ARRANGEMENT CONSIDERATION. THESE NEW STANDARDS ARE EFFECTIVE FOR US BEGINNING JUNE 1, 2011. WE DO NOT EXPECT THE

ADOPTION WILL HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL POSITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

OUR PREVIOUS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS ARE BASED UPON OUR CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, WHICH HAVE BEEN PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. THE PREPARATION OF THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS REQUIRES US TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS THAT AFFECT THE

REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS, LIABILITIES, REVENUES AND EXPENSES, AND RELATED DISCLOSURE OF CONTINGENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES.

WE BELIEVE THAT THE ESTIMATES, ASSUMPTIONS AND JUDGMENTS INVOLVED IN THE ACCOUNTING POLICIES DESCRIBED BELOW HAVE THE GREATEST POTENTIAL

IMPACT ON OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, SO WE CONSIDER THESE TO BE OUR CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES. BECAUSE OF THE UNCERTAINTY INHERENT IN THESE MATTERS, ACTUAL RESULTS COULD DIFFER FROM THE ESTIMATES WE USE IN APPLYING THE CRITICAL ACCOUNTING

POLICIES. CERTAIN OF THESE CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AFFECT WORKING CAPITAL ACCOUNT BALANCES, INCLUDING THE POLICIES FOR REVENUE RECOGNITION, THE ALLOWANCE FOR UNCOLLECTIBLE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, INVENTORY RESERVES, AND CONTINGENT PAYMENTS UNDER

ENDORSEMENT CONTRACTS. THESE POLICIES REQUIRE THAT WE MAKE ESTIMATES IN THE PREPARATION OF OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AS OF A GIVEN DATE. HOWEVER, SINCE OUR BUSINESS CYCLE IS RELATIVELY SHORT, ACTUAL RESULTS RELATED TO THESE ESTIMATES ARE GENERALLY

KNOWN WITHIN THE SIX-MONTH PERIOD FOLLOWING THE FINANCIAL STATEMENT DATE. THUS, THESE POLICIES GENERALLY AFFECT ONLY THE TIMING OF REPORTED AMOUNTS ACROSS TWO TO THREE FISCAL QUARTERS.

WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF THESE CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES, WE ARE NOT CURRENTLY AWARE OF ANY REASONABLY LIKELY EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES

THAT WOULD RESULT IN MATERIALLY DIFFERENT AMOUNTS BEING REPORTED.

REVENUE RECOGNITION

WE RECORD WHOLESALE REVENUES WHEN TITLE PASSES AND THE RISKS AND REWARDS OF OWNERSHIP HAVE PASSED TO THE CUSTOMER, BASED ON THE TERMS OF

SALE. TITLE PASSES GENERALLY UPON SHIPMENT OR UPON RECEIPT BY THE CUSTOMER DEPENDING ON THE COUNTRY OF THE SALE AND THE AGREEMENT WITH THE CUSTOMER. RETAIL STORE REVENUES ARE RECORDED AT THE TIME OF SALE.

46

TABLE OF CONTENTS

IN SOME INSTANCES, WE SHIP PRODUCT DIRECTLY FROM OUR SUPPLIER TO THE CUSTOMER AND RECOGNIZE

REVENUE WHEN THE PRODUCT IS DELIVERED TO AND ACCEPTED BY THE CUSTOMER. OUR REVENUES MAY FLUCTUATE IN CASES WHEN OUR CUSTOMERS DELAY ACCEPTING SHIPMENT OF PRODUCT FOR PERIODS UP TO SEVERAL WEEKS.

IN CERTAIN COUNTRIES OUTSIDE OF THE U.S., PRECISE INFORMATION REGARDING THE DATE OF RECEIPT BY THE CUSTOMER IS NOT READILY AVAILABLE. IN

THESE CASES, WE ESTIMATE THE DATE OF RECEIPT BY THE CUSTOMER BASED UPON HISTORICAL DELIVERY TIMES BY GEOGRAPHIC LOCATION. ON THE BASIS OF OUR TESTS OF ACTUAL TRANSACTIONS, WE HAVE NO INDICATION THAT THESE ESTIMATES HAVE BEEN MATERIALLY INACCURATE

HISTORICALLY.

AS PART OF OUR REVENUE RECOGNITION POLICY, WE RECORD ESTIMATED SALES RETURNS, DISCOUNTS AND MISCELLANEOUS

CLAIMS FROM CUSTOMERS AS REDUCTIONS TO REVENUES AT THE TIME REVENUES ARE RECORDED. WE BASE OUR ESTIMATES ON HISTORICAL RATES OF PRODUCT RETURNS, DISCOUNTS AND CLAIMS, AND SPECIFIC IDENTIFICATION OF OUTSTANDING CLAIMS AND OUTSTANDING RETURNS NOT YET

RECEIVED FROM CUSTOMERS. ACTUAL RETURNS, DISCOUNTS AND CLAIMS IN ANY FUTURE PERIOD ARE INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN AND THUS MAY DIFFER FROM OUR ESTIMATES. IF ACTUAL OR EXPECTED FUTURE RETURNS, DISCOUNTS AND CLAIMS WERE SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER OR LOWER THAN

THE RESERVES WE HAD ESTABLISHED, WE WOULD RECORD A REDUCTION OR INCREASE TO NET REVENUES IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH WE MADE SUCH DETERMINATION.

ALLOWANCE FOR UNCOLLECTIBLE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE

WE MAKE ONGOING

ESTIMATES RELATING TO THE ABILITY TO COLLECT OUR ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND MAINTAIN AN ALLOWANCE FOR ESTIMATED LOSSES RESULTING FROM THE INABILITY OF OUR CUSTOMERS TO MAKE REQUIRED PAYMENTS. IN DETERMINING THE AMOUNT OF THE ALLOWANCE, WE CONSIDER OUR

HISTORICAL LEVEL OF CREDIT LOSSES AND MAKE JUDGMENTS ABOUT THE CREDITWORTHINESS OF SIGNIFICANT CUSTOMERS BASED ON ONGOING CREDIT EVALUATIONS. SINCE WE CANNOT PREDICT FUTURE CHANGES IN THE FINANCIAL STABILITY OF OUR CUSTOMERS, ACTUAL FUTURE LOSSES

FROM UNCOLLECTIBLE ACCOUNTS MAY DIFFER FROM OUR ESTIMATES. IF THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF OUR CUSTOMERS WERE TO DETERIORATE, RESULTING IN THEIR INABILITY TO MAKE PAYMENTS, A LARGER ALLOWANCE MIGHT BE REQUIRED. IN THE EVENT WE DETERMINE THAT A SMALLER

OR LARGER ALLOWANCE IS APPROPRIATE, WE WOULD RECORD A CREDIT OR A CHARGE TO SELLING AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH SUCH A DETERMINATION IS MADE.

INVENTORY RESERVES

WE ALSO MAKE ONGOING ESTIMATES RELATING TO THE

NET REALIZABLE VALUE OF INVENTORIES, BASED UPON OUR ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT FUTURE DEMAND AND MARKET CONDITIONS. IF WE ESTIMATE THAT THE NET REALIZABLE VALUE OF OUR INVENTORY IS LESS THAN THE COST OF THE INVENTORY RECORDED ON OUR BOOKS, WE RECORD A

RESERVE EQUAL TO THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE COST OF THE INVENTORY AND THE ESTIMATED NET REALIZABLE VALUE. THIS RESERVE IS RECORDED AS A CHARGE TO COST OF SALES. IF CHANGES IN MARKET CONDITIONS RESULT IN REDUCTIONS IN THE ESTIMATED NET REALIZABLE

VALUE OF OUR INVENTORY BELOW OUR PREVIOUS ESTIMATE, WE WOULD INCREASE OUR RESERVE IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH WE MADE SUCH A DETERMINATION AND RECORD A CHARGE TO COST OF SALES.

CONTINGENT PAYMENTS UNDER ENDORSEMENT CONTRACTS

A SIGNIFICANT

PORTION OF OUR DEMAND CREATION EXPENSE RELATES TO PAYMENTS UNDER ENDORSEMENT CONTRACTS. IN GENERAL, ENDORSEMENT PAYMENTS ARE EXPENSED UNIFORMLY OVER THE TERM OF THE CONTRACT. HOWEVER, CERTAIN CONTRACT ELEMENTS MAY BE ACCOUNTED FOR DIFFERENTLY, BASED

UPON THE FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES OF EACH INDIVIDUAL CONTRACT.

SOME OF THE CONTRACTS PROVIDE FOR CONTINGENT PAYMENTS TO

ENDORSERS BASED UPON SPECIFIC ACHIEVEMENTS IN THEIR SPORTS (E.G., WINNING A CHAMPIONSHIP). WE RECORD SELLING AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE FOR THESE AMOUNTS WHEN THE ENDORSER ACHIEVES THE SPECIFIC GOAL.

SOME OF THE CONTRACTS PROVIDE FOR PAYMENTS BASED UPON ENDORSERS MAINTAINING A LEVEL OF PERFORMANCE IN THEIR SPORT OVER AN EXTENDED PERIOD

OF TIME (E.G., MAINTAINING A TOP RANKING IN A SPORT FOR A YEAR). THESE AMOUNTS ARE REPORTED IN SELLING AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE WHEN WE DETERMINE THAT IT IS PROBABLE THAT THE SPECIFIED LEVEL

47

TABLE OF CONTENTS

OF PERFORMANCE WILL BE MAINTAINED THROUGHOUT THE PERIOD. IN THESE INSTANCES, TO THE EXTENT THAT ACTUAL PAYMENTS TO THE ENDORSER DIFFER FROM OUR ESTIMATE DUE TO CHANGES IN THE ENDORSERS

ATHLETIC PERFORMANCE, INCREASED OR DECREASED SELLING AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE MAY BE REPORTED IN A FUTURE PERIOD.

SOME OF

THE CONTRACTS PROVIDE FOR ROYALTY PAYMENTS TO ENDORSERS BASED UPON A PREDETERMINED PERCENTAGE OF SALES OF PARTICULAR PRODUCTS. WE EXPENSE THESE PAYMENTS IN COST OF SALES AS THE RELATED SALES OCCUR. IN CERTAIN CONTRACTS, WE OFFER MINIMUM GUARANTEED

ROYALTY PAYMENTS. FOR CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS FOR WHICH WE ESTIMATE WE WILL NOT MEET THE MINIMUM GUARANTEED AMOUNT OF ROYALTY FEES THROUGH SALES OF PRODUCT, WE RECORD THE AMOUNT OF THE GUARANTEED PAYMENT IN EXCESS OF THAT EARNED THROUGH SALES OF

PRODUCT IN SELLING AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE UNIFORMLY OVER THE REMAINING GUARANTEE PERIOD.

PROPERTY, PLANT AND

EQUIPMENT AND DEFINITE-LIVED ASSETS

PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT, INCLUDING BUILDINGS, EQUIPMENT, AND COMPUTER

HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE ARE RECORDED AT COST (INCLUDING, IN SOME CASES, THE COST OF INTERNAL LABOR) AND ARE DEPRECIATED OVER THE ESTIMATED USEFUL LIFE. CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES (SUCH AS TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES OR CHANGES TO OUR BUSINESS OPERATIONS) CAN

RESULT IN DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE ACTUAL AND ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES. IN THOSE CASES WHERE WE DETERMINE THAT THE USEFUL LIFE OF A LONG-LIVED ASSET SHOULD BE SHORTENED, WE INCREASE DEPRECIATION EXPENSE OVER THE REMAINING USEFUL LIFE TO DEPRECIATE THE

ASSETS NET BOOK VALUE TO ITS SALVAGE VALUE.

WE REVIEW THE CARRYING VALUE OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS OR ASSET GROUPS TO BE

USED IN OPERATIONS WHENEVER EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THAT THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF THE ASSETS MIGHT NOT BE RECOVERABLE. FACTORS THAT WOULD NECESSITATE AN IMPAIRMENT ASSESSMENT INCLUDE A SIGNIFICANT ADVERSE CHANGE IN THE EXTENT OR

MANNER IN WHICH AN ASSET IS USED, A SIGNIFICANT ADVERSE CHANGE IN LEGAL FACTORS OR THE BUSINESS CLIMATE THAT COULD AFFECT THE VALUE OF THE ASSET, OR A SIGNIFICANT DECLINE IN THE OBSERVABLE MARKET VALUE OF AN ASSET, AMONG OTHERS. IF SUCH FACTS

INDICATE A POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT, WE WOULD ASSESS THE RECOVERABILITY OF AN ASSET GROUP BY DETERMINING IF THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE ASSET GROUP EXCEEDS THE SUM OF THE PROJECTED UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS EXPECTED TO RESULT FROM THE USE AND EVENTUAL

DISPOSITION OF THE ASSETS OVER THE REMAINING ECONOMIC LIFE OF THE PRIMARY ASSET IN THE ASSET GROUP. IF THE RECOVERABILITY TEST INDICATES THAT THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE ASSET GROUP IS NOT RECOVERABLE, WE WILL ESTIMATE THE FAIR VALUE OF THE ASSET

GROUP USING APPROPRIATE VALUATION METHODOLOGIES WHICH WOULD TYPICALLY INCLUDE AN ESTIMATE OF DISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS. ANY IMPAIRMENT WOULD BE MEASURED AS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE ASSET GROUPS CARRYING AMOUNT AND ITS ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE.

GOODWILL AND INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS

WE PERFORM ANNUAL IMPAIRMENT TESTS ON GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS WITH INDEFINITE LIVES IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF EACH FISCAL YEAR, OR WHEN EVENTS OCCUR OR CIRCUMSTANCES CHANGE THAT WOULD, MORE LIKELY

THAN NOT, REDUCE THE FAIR VALUE OF A REPORTING UNIT OR AN INTANGIBLE ASSET WITH AN INDEFINITE LIFE BELOW ITS CARRYING VALUE. EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES THAT MAY TRIGGER INTERIM IMPAIRMENT REVIEWS INCLUDE SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN BUSINESS

CLIMATE, OPERATING RESULTS, PLANNED INVESTMENTS IN THE REPORTING UNIT, OR AN EXPECTATION THAT THE CARRYING AMOUNT MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE, AMONG OTHER FACTORS. THE IMPAIRMENT TEST REQUIRES US TO ESTIMATE THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR REPORTING UNITS. IF THE

CARRYING VALUE OF A REPORTING UNIT EXCEEDS ITS FAIR VALUE, THE GOODWILL OF THAT REPORTING UNIT IS POTENTIALLY IMPAIRED AND WE PROCEED TO STEP TWO OF THE IMPAIRMENT ANALYSIS. IN STEP TWO OF THE ANALYSIS, WE MEASURE AND RECORD AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS EQUAL

TO THE EXCESS OF THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE REPORTING UNITS GOODWILL OVER ITS IMPLIED FAIR VALUE SHOULD SUCH A CIRCUMSTANCE ARISE.

WE GENERALLY BASE OUR MEASUREMENT OF THE FAIR VALUE OF A REPORTING UNIT ON A BLENDED ANALYSIS OF THE PRESENT VALUE OF FUTURE DISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS AND THE MARKET VALUATION APPROACH. THE DISCOUNTED CASH

FLOWS MODEL INDICATES THE FAIR VALUE OF THE REPORTING UNIT BASED ON THE PRESENT VALUE OF THE CASH FLOWS WE EXPECT THE REPORTING UNIT TO GENERATE IN THE FUTURE. OUR SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES IN THE DISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS MODEL INCLUDE: OUR WEIGHTED

AVERAGE COST OF CAPITAL; LONG-TERM RATE OF GROWTH AND PROFITABILITY OF THE REPORTING UNITS BUSINESS; AND WORKING CAPITAL EFFECTS. THE MARKET VALUATION APPROACH INDICATES THE FAIR VALUE OF THE BUSINESS BASED ON A COMPARISON OF

48

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE REPORTING UNIT TO COMPARABLE PUBLICLY TRADED FIRMS IN SIMILAR LINES OF BUSINESS. SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES IN THE MARKET VALUATION APPROACH MODEL INCLUDE IDENTIFYING SIMILAR COMPANIES WITH

COMPARABLE BUSINESS FACTORS SUCH AS SIZE, GROWTH, PROFITABILITY, RISK AND RETURN ON INVESTMENT AND ASSESSING COMPARABLE REVENUE AND OPERATING INCOME MULTIPLES IN ESTIMATING THE FAIR VALUE OF THE REPORTING UNIT.

WE BELIEVE THE WEIGHTED USE OF DISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS AND THE MARKET VALUATION APPROACH IS THE BEST METHOD FOR DETERMINING THE FAIR VALUE

OF OUR REPORTING UNITS BECAUSE THESE ARE THE MOST COMMON VALUATION METHODOLOGIES USED WITHIN OUR INDUSTRY, AND THE BLENDED USE OF BOTH MODELS COMPENSATES FOR THE INHERENT RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH EITHER MODEL IF USED ON A STAND-ALONE BASIS.

INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS PRIMARILY CONSIST OF ACQUIRED TRADE NAMES AND TRADEMARKS. IN MEASURING THE FAIR VALUE FOR THESE

INTANGIBLE ASSETS, WE UTILIZE THE RELIEF-FROM-ROYALTY METHOD. THIS METHOD ASSUMES THAT TRADE NAMES AND TRADEMARKS HAVE VALUE TO THE EXTENT THAT THEIR OWNER IS RELIEVED OF THE OBLIGATION TO PAY ROYALTIES FOR THE BENEFITS RECEIVED FROM THEM. THIS

METHOD REQUIRES US TO ESTIMATE THE FUTURE REVENUE FOR THE RELATED BRANDS, THE APPROPRIATE ROYALTY RATE AND THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE COST OF CAPITAL.

HEDGE ACCOUNTING FOR DERIVATIVES

WE USE FORWARD AND OPTION

CONTRACTS TO HEDGE CERTAIN ANTICIPATED FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE TRANSACTIONS AS WELL AS CERTAIN NON-FUNCTIONAL MONETARY ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. WHEN THE SPECIFIC CRITERIA TO QUALIFY FOR HEDGE ACCOUNTING HAS BEEN MET, CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF

CONTRACTS HEDGE PROBABLE FORECASTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS ARE RECORDED IN OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME, RATHER THAN NET INCOME, UNTIL THE UNDERLYING HEDGED TRANSACTION AFFECTS NET INCOME. IN MOST CASES, THIS RESULTS IN GAINS AND LOSSES ON HEDGE

DERIVATIVES BEING RELEASED FROM OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME INTO NET INCOME SOME TIME AFTER THE MATURITY OF THE DERIVATIVE. ONE OF THE CRITERIA FOR THIS ACCOUNTING TREATMENT IS THAT THE FORWARD AND OPTION CONTRACTS AMOUNT SHOULD NOT BE IN EXCESS OF

SPECIFICALLY IDENTIFIED ANTICIPATED TRANSACTIONS. BY THEIR VERY NATURE, OUR ESTIMATES OF ANTICIPATED TRANSACTIONS MAY FLUCTUATE OVER TIME AND MAY ULTIMATELY VARY FROM ACTUAL TRANSACTIONS. WHEN ANTICIPATED TRANSACTION ESTIMATES OR ACTUAL TRANSACTION

AMOUNTS DECLINE BELOW HEDGED LEVELS, OR IF IT IS NO LONGER PROBABLE THAT A FORECASTED TRANSACTION WILL OCCUR BY THE END OF THE ORIGINALLY SPECIFIED TIME PERIOD OR WITHIN AN ADDITIONAL TWO-MONTH PERIOD OF TIME THEREAFTER, WE ARE REQUIRED TO

RECLASSIFY THE INEFFECTIVE PORTION OF THE CUMULATIVE CHANGES IN FAIR VALUES OF THE RELATED HEDGE CONTRACTS FROM OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME TO OTHER (INCOME), NET DURING THE QUARTER IN WHICH SUCH CHANGES OCCUR.

WE USE FORWARD CONTRACTS TO HEDGE OUR INVESTMENT IN THE NET ASSETS OF CERTAIN INTERNATIONAL SUBSIDIARIES TO OFFSET FOREIGN CURRENCY

TRANSLATION RELATED TO OUR NET INVESTMENT IN THOSE SUBSIDIARIES. THE CHANGE IN FAIR VALUE OF THE FORWARD CONTRACTS HEDGING OUR NET INVESTMENTS IS REPORTED IN THE CUMULATIVE TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENT COMPONENT OF ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME

WITHIN STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY, TO THE EXTENT EFFECTIVE, TO OFFSET THE FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENTS ON THOSE INVESTMENTS. AS THE VALUE OF OUR UNDERLYING NET INVESTMENTS IN WHOLLY-OWNED INTERNATIONAL SUBSIDIARIES IS KNOWN AT THE TIME A

HEDGE IS PLACED, THE DESIGNATED HEDGE IS MATCHED TO THE PORTION OF OUR NET INVESTMENT AT RISK. ACCORDINGLY, THE VARIABILITY INVOLVED IN NET INVESTMENT HEDGES IS SUBSTANTIALLY LESS THAN THAT OF OTHER TYPES OF HEDGE TRANSACTIONS AND WE DO NOT EXPECT

ANY MATERIAL INEFFECTIVENESS. WE CONSIDER, ON A QUARTERLY BASIS, THE NEED TO REDESIGNATE EXISTING HEDGE RELATIONSHIPS BASED ON CHANGES IN THE UNDERLYING NET INVESTMENT. SHOULD THE LEVEL OF OUR NET INVESTMENT DECREASE BELOW HEDGED LEVELS, ANY

RESULTING INEFFECTIVENESS WOULD BE REPORTED DIRECTLY TO EARNINGS IN THE PERIOD INCURRED.

STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION

WE ACCOUNT FOR STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION BY ESTIMATING THE FAIR VALUE OF STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION ON THE DATE OF GRANT

USING THE BLACK-SCHOLES OPTION PRICING MODEL. THE BLACK-SCHOLES OPTION PRICING MODEL REQUIRES THE INPUT OF HIGHLY SUBJECTIVE ASSUMPTIONS INCLUDING VOLATILITY. EXPECTED VOLATILITY IS ESTIMATED BASED ON IMPLIED VOLATILITY IN MARKET TRADED OPTIONS ON

OUR COMMON STOCK WITH A TERM GREATER THAN ONE YEAR, ALONG WITH OTHER FACTORS. OUR DECISION TO USE IMPLIED VOLATILITY WAS BASED ON THE AVAILABILITY OF ACTIVELY TRADED OPTIONS ON OUR

49

TABLE OF CONTENTS

COMMON STOCK AND OUR ASSESSMENT THAT IMPLIED VOLATILITY IS MORE REPRESENTATIVE OF FUTURE STOCK PRICE TRENDS THAN HISTORICAL VOLATILITY. IF FACTORS CHANGE AND WE USE DIFFERENT ASSUMPTIONS FOR

ESTIMATING STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE IN FUTURE PERIODS, STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE MAY DIFFER MATERIALLY IN THE FUTURE FROM THAT RECORDED IN THE CURRENT PERIOD.

TAXES

WE RECORD VALUATION ALLOWANCES AGAINST OUR DEFERRED TAX

ASSETS, WHEN NECESSARY. REALIZATION OF DEFERRED TAX ASSETS (SUCH AS NET OPERATING LOSS CARRY-FORWARDS) IS DEPENDENT ON FUTURE TAXABLE EARNINGS AND IS THEREFORE UNCERTAIN. AT LEAST QUARTERLY, WE ASSESS THE LIKELIHOOD THAT OUR DEFERRED TAX ASSET

BALANCE WILL BE RECOVERED FROM FUTURE TAXABLE INCOME. TO THE EXTENT WE BELIEVE THAT RECOVERY IS NOT LIKELY, WE ESTABLISH A VALUATION ALLOWANCE AGAINST OUR DEFERRED TAX ASSET, WHICH INCREASES OUR INCOME TAX EXPENSE IN THE PERIOD WHEN SUCH

DETERMINATION IS MADE.

IN ADDITION, WE HAVE NOT RECORDED U.S. INCOME TAX EXPENSE FOR FOREIGN EARNINGS THAT WE HAVE DETERMINED

TO BE INDEFINITELY REINVESTED OFFSHORE, THUS REDUCING OUR OVERALL INCOME TAX EXPENSE. THE AMOUNT OF EARNINGS DESIGNATED AS INDEFINITELY REINVESTED OFFSHORE IS BASED UPON THE ACTUAL DEPLOYMENT OF SUCH EARNINGS IN OUR OFFSHORE ASSETS AND OUR

EXPECTATIONS OF THE FUTURE CASH NEEDS OF OUR U.S. AND FOREIGN ENTITIES. INCOME TAX CONSIDERATIONS ARE ALSO A FACTOR IN DETERMINING THE AMOUNT OF FOREIGN EARNINGS TO BE INDEFINITELY REINVESTED OFFSHORE.

WE CAREFULLY REVIEW ALL FACTORS THAT DRIVE THE ULTIMATE DISPOSITION OF FOREIGN EARNINGS DETERMINED TO BE REINVESTED OFFSHORE, AND APPLY

STRINGENT STANDARDS TO OVERCOMING THE PRESUMPTION OF REPATRIATION. DESPITE THIS APPROACH, BECAUSE THE DETERMINATION INVOLVES OUR FUTURE PLANS AND EXPECTATIONS OF FUTURE EVENTS, THE POSSIBILITY EXISTS THAT AMOUNTS DECLARED AS INDEFINITELY REINVESTED

OFFSHORE MAY ULTIMATELY BE REPATRIATED. FOR INSTANCE, THE ACTUAL CASH NEEDS OF OUR U.S. ENTITIES MAY EXCEED OUR CURRENT EXPECTATIONS, OR THE ACTUAL CASH NEEDS OF OUR FOREIGN ENTITIES MAY BE LESS THAN OUR CURRENT EXPECTATIONS. THIS WOULD RESULT IN

ADDITIONAL INCOME TAX EXPENSE IN THE YEAR WE DETERMINED THAT AMOUNTS WERE NO LONGER INDEFINITELY REINVESTED OFFSHORE. CONVERSELY, OUR APPROACH MAY ALSO RESULT IN A DETERMINATION THAT ACCUMULATED FOREIGN EARNINGS (FOR WHICH U.S. INCOME TAXES HAVE

BEEN PROVIDED) WILL BE INDEFINITELY REINVESTED OFFSHORE. IN THIS CASE, OUR INCOME TAX EXPENSE WOULD BE REDUCED IN THE YEAR OF SUCH DETERMINATION.

ON AN INTERIM BASIS, WE ESTIMATE WHAT OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE WILL BE FOR THE FULL FISCAL YEAR. THE ESTIMATED ANNUAL EFFECTIVE TAX RATE IS THEN APPLIED TO THE YEAR-TO-DATE PRE-TAX INCOME EXCLUDING

INFREQUENTLY OCCURRING OR UNUSUAL ITEMS, TO DETERMINE THE YEAR-TO-DATE TAX EXPENSE. THE INCOME TAX EFFECTS OF INFREQUENT OR UNUSUAL ITEMS ARE RECOGNIZED IN THE INTERIM PERIOD IN WHICH THEY OCCUR. AS THE FISCAL YEAR PROGRESSES, WE CONTINUALLY REFINE

OUR ESTIMATE BASED UPON ACTUAL EVENTS AND EARNINGS BY JURISDICTION DURING THE YEAR. THIS CONTINUAL ESTIMATION PROCESS PERIODICALLY RESULTS IN A CHANGE TO OUR EXPECTED EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR THE FISCAL YEAR. WHEN THIS OCCURS, WE ADJUST THE INCOME TAX

PROVISION DURING THE QUARTER IN WHICH THE CHANGE IN ESTIMATE OCCURS.

ON A QUARTERLY BASIS, WE REEVALUATE THE PROBABILITY THAT

A TAX POSITION WILL BE EFFECTIVELY SUSTAINED AND THE APPROPRIATENESS OF THE AMOUNT RECOGNIZED FOR UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS BASED ON FACTORS INCLUDING CHANGES IN FACTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES, CHANGES IN TAX LAW, SETTLED AUDIT ISSUES AND NEW AUDIT ACTIVITY.

CHANGES IN OUR ASSESSMENT MAY RESULT IN THE RECOGNITION OF A TAX BENEFIT OR AN ADDITIONAL CHARGE TO THE TAX PROVISION IN THE PERIOD OUR ASSESSMENT CHANGES. WE RECOGNIZE INTEREST AND PENALTIES RELATED TO INCOME TAX MATTERS IN INCOME TAX EXPENSE.

OTHER CONTINGENCIES

IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS, WE ARE INVOLVED IN LEGAL PROCEEDINGS REGARDING CONTRACTUAL AND EMPLOYMENT RELATIONSHIPS, PRODUCT LIABILITY CLAIMS, TRADEMARK RIGHTS, AND A VARIETY OF OTHER MATTERS. WE

RECORD CONTINGENT LIABILITIES RESULTING FROM CLAIMS AGAINST US, INCLUDING RELATED LEGAL COSTS, WHEN A LOSS IS ASSESSED TO BE PROBABLE AND THE AMOUNT OF THE LOSS IS REASONABLY ESTIMABLE. ASSESSING PROBABILITY OF LOSS AND ESTIMATING PROBABLE LOSSES

REQUIRES ANALYSIS OF MULTIPLE FACTORS, INCLUDING IN SOME CASES JUDGMENTS ABOUT THE POTENTIAL

50

TABLE OF CONTENTS

ACTIONS OF THIRD PARTY CLAIMANTS AND COURTS. RECORDED CONTINGENT LIABILITIES ARE BASED ON THE BEST INFORMATION AVAILABLE AND ACTUAL LOSSES IN ANY FUTURE PERIOD ARE INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN. IF FUTURE

ADJUSTMENTS TO ESTIMATED PROBABLE FUTURE LOSSES OR ACTUAL LOSSES EXCEED OUR RECORDED LIABILITY FOR SUCH CLAIMS, WE WOULD RECORD ADDITIONAL CHARGES AS OTHER (INCOME), NET DURING THE PERIOD IN WHICH THE ACTUAL LOSS OR CHANGE IN ESTIMATE OCCURRED. IN

ADDITION TO CONTINGENT LIABILITIES RECORDED FOR PROBABLE LOSSES, WE DISCLOSE CONTINGENT LIABILITIES WHEN THERE IS A REASONABLE POSSIBILITY THAT THE ULTIMATE LOSS WILL MATERIALLY EXCEED THE RECORDED LIABILITY. CURRENTLY, WE DO NOT BELIEVE THAT ANY OF

OUR PENDING LEGAL PROCEEDINGS OR CLAIMS WILL HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR FINANCIAL POSITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

ITEM 7A.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS AND CONSISTENT WITH ESTABLISHED POLICIES AND PROCEDURES, WE EMPLOY A VARIETY OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS TO MANAGE EXPOSURE TO FLUCTUATIONS IN THE VALUE OF FOREIGN CURRENCIES

AND INTEREST RATES. IT IS OUR POLICY TO UTILIZE THESE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS ONLY WHERE NECESSARY TO FINANCE OUR BUSINESS AND MANAGE SUCH EXPOSURES; WE DO NOT ENTER INTO THESE TRANSACTIONS FOR SPECULATIVE PURPOSES.

WE ARE EXPOSED TO FOREIGN CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS, PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF OUR INTERNATIONAL SALES, PRODUCT SOURCING AND FUNDING

ACTIVITIES. OUR FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK MANAGEMENT PROGRAM IS INTENDED TO MINIMIZE BOTH THE POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE EFFECTS OF CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS ON OUR CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL POSITION AND CASH FLOWS. THIS ALSO HAS THE EFFECT OF

DELAYING THE IMPACT OF CURRENT MARKET RATES ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS DEPENDENT UPON HEDGE HORIZONS. WE USE FORWARD EXCHANGE CONTRACTS AND OPTIONS TO HEDGE CERTAIN ANTICIPATED BUT NOT YET FIRMLY COMMITTED TRANSACTIONS AS WELL AS

CERTAIN FIRM COMMITMENTS AND THE RELATED RECEIVABLES AND PAYABLES, INCLUDING THIRD PARTY AND INTERCOMPANY TRANSACTIONS. WE ALSO USE FORWARD CONTRACTS TO HEDGE OUR INVESTMENT IN THE NET ASSETS OF CERTAIN INTERNATIONAL SUBSIDIARIES TO OFFSET FOREIGN

CURRENCY TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENTS RELATED TO OUR NET INVESTMENT IN THOSE SUBSIDIARIES.

WHEN WE BEGIN HEDGING EXPOSURES, THE

TYPE AND DURATION OF EACH HEDGE DEPENDS ON THE NATURE OF THE EXPOSURE AND MARKET CONDITIONS. GENERALLY, ALL ANTICIPATED AND FIRMLY COMMITTED TRANSACTIONS THAT ARE HEDGED ARE TO BE RECOGNIZED WITHIN 12 TO 18 MONTHS. THE MAJORITY OF THE CONTRACTS

EXPIRING IN MORE THAN 12 MONTHS RELATE TO THE ANTICIPATED PURCHASE OF INVENTORY. WHEN INTERCOMPANY LOANS ARE HEDGED, IT IS TYPICALLY FOR THEIR EXPECTED DURATION. HEDGED TRANSACTIONS ARE PRINCIPALLY DENOMINATED IN EUROS, JAPANESE YEN AND BRITISH

POUNDS. SEE SECTION FOREIGN CURRENCY EXPOSURES AND HEDGING PRACTICES UNDER ITEM 7 FOR ADDITIONAL DETAIL.

OUR

EARNINGS ARE ALSO EXPOSED TO MOVEMENTS IN SHORT AND LONG-TERM MARKET INTEREST RATES. OUR OBJECTIVE IN MANAGING THIS INTEREST RATE EXPOSURE IS TO LIMIT THE IMPACT OF INTEREST RATE CHANGES ON EARNINGS AND CASH FLOWS AND TO REDUCE OVERALL BORROWING

COSTS. TO ACHIEVE THESE OBJECTIVES, WE MAINTAIN A MIX OF COMMERCIAL PAPER, BANK LOANS AND FIXED RATE DEBT OF VARYING MATURITIES AND HAVE ENTERED INTO RECEIVE-FIXED, PAY-VARIABLE INTEREST RATE SWAPS.

MARKET RISK MEASUREMENT

WE MONITOR FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK, INTEREST RATE RISK AND RELATED DERIVATIVES USING A VARIETY OF TECHNIQUES INCLUDING A REVIEW OF MARKET

VALUE, SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS, AND VALUE-AT-RISK (VAR). OUR MARKET-SENSITIVE DERIVATIVE AND OTHER FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS ARE FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS, FOREIGN CURRENCY OPTION CONTRACTS, INTEREST RATE SWAPS, INTERCOMPANY LOANS

DENOMINATED IN NON-FUNCTIONAL CURRENCIES, FIXED INTEREST RATE U.S. DOLLAR DENOMINATED DEBT, AND FIXED INTEREST RATE JAPANESE YEN DENOMINATED DEBT.

WE USE VAR TO MONITOR THE FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK OF OUR FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD AND FOREIGN CURRENCY OPTION DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS ONLY. THE VAR DETERMINES THE MAXIMUM POTENTIAL ONE-DAY LOSS IN THE FAIR

VALUE OF THESE FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATE-SENSITIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS. THE VAR MODEL ESTIMATES ASSUME NORMAL MARKET CONDITIONS AND A 95% CONFIDENCE LEVEL. THERE ARE VARIOUS MODELING TECHNIQUES THAT CAN BE USED IN THE VAR COMPUTATION. OUR COMPUTATIONS

ARE BASED ON INTERRELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN CURRENCIES AND INTEREST RATES (A VARIANCE/CO-VARIANCE TECHNIQUE). THESE INTERRELATIONSHIPS ARE A FUNCTION OF FOREIGN EXCHANGE CURRENCY MARKET CHANGES

51

TABLE OF CONTENTS

AND INTEREST RATE CHANGES OVER THE PRECEDING ONE YEAR PERIOD. THE VALUE OF FOREIGN CURRENCY OPTIONS DOES NOT CHANGE ON A ONE-TO-ONE BASIS WITH CHANGES IN THE UNDERLYING CURRENCY RATE. WE ADJUSTED

THE POTENTIAL LOSS IN OPTION VALUE FOR THE ESTIMATED SENSITIVITY (THE DELTA AND GAMMA) TO CHANGES IN THE UNDERLYING CURRENCY RATE. THIS CALCULATION REFLECTS THE IMPACT OF FOREIGN CURRENCY RATE FLUCTUATIONS ON THE DERIVATIVE

INSTRUMENTS ONLY AND DOES NOT INCLUDE THE IMPACT OF SUCH RATE FLUCTUATIONS ON NON-FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY TRANSACTIONS (SUCH AS ANTICIPATED TRANSACTIONS, FIRM COMMITMENTS, CASH BALANCES, AND ACCOUNTS AND LOANS RECEIVABLE AND PAYABLE), INCLUDING THOSE

WHICH ARE HEDGED BY THESE INSTRUMENTS.

THE VAR MODEL IS A RISK ANALYSIS TOOL AND DOES NOT PURPORT TO REPRESENT ACTUAL LOSSES

IN FAIR VALUE THAT WE WILL INCUR, NOR DOES IT CONSIDER THE POTENTIAL EFFECT OF FAVORABLE CHANGES IN MARKET RATES. IT ALSO DOES NOT REPRESENT THE FULL EXTENT OF THE POSSIBLE LOSS THAT MAY OCCUR. ACTUAL FUTURE GAINS AND LOSSES WILL DIFFER FROM THOSE

ESTIMATED BECAUSE OF CHANGES OR DIFFERENCES IN MARKET RATES AND INTERRELATIONSHIPS, HEDGING INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGE PERCENTAGES, TIMING AND OTHER FACTORS.

THE ESTIMATED MAXIMUM ONE-DAY LOSS IN FAIR VALUE ON OUR FOREIGN CURRENCY SENSITIVE DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, DERIVED USING THE VAR MODEL, WAS $33 MILLION AND $17 MILLION AT MAY 31, 2011 AND

2010, RESPECTIVELY. THE VAR INCREASED YEAR-OVER-YEAR PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF INCREASED FOREIGN CURRENCY VOLATILITIES AT MAY 31, 2011. SUCH A HYPOTHETICAL LOSS IN FAIR VALUE OF OUR DERIVATIVES WOULD BE OFFSET BY INCREASES IN THE VALUE OF THE

UNDERLYING TRANSACTIONS BEING HEDGED. THE AVERAGE MONTHLY CHANGE IN THE FAIR VALUES OF FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD AND FOREIGN CURRENCY OPTION DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS WAS $79 MILLION AND $52 MILLION DURING FISCAL 2011 AND FISCAL 2010, RESPECTIVELY.

THE INSTRUMENTS NOT INCLUDED IN THE VAR ARE INTERCOMPANY LOANS DENOMINATED IN NON-FUNCTIONAL CURRENCIES, FIXED INTEREST RATE

JAPANESE YEN DENOMINATED DEBT, FIXED INTEREST RATE U.S. DOLLAR DENOMINATED DEBT AND INTEREST RATE SWAPS. INTERCOMPANY LOANS AND RELATED INTEREST AMOUNTS ARE ELIMINATED IN CONSOLIDATION. FURTHERMORE, OUR NON-FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY INTERCOMPANY LOANS ARE

SUBSTANTIALLY HEDGED AGAINST FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK THROUGH THE USE OF FORWARD CONTRACTS, WHICH ARE INCLUDED IN THE VAR CALCULATION ABOVE. WE, THEREFORE, CONSIDER THE INTEREST RATE AND FOREIGN CURRENCY MARKET RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR NON-FUNCTIONAL

CURRENCY INTERCOMPANY LOANS TO BE IMMATERIAL TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL POSITION, RESULTS FROM OPERATIONS AND CASH FLOWS.

MANAGEMENTS ANNUAL REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

MANAGEMENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ESTABLISHING AND MAINTAINING ADEQUATE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, AS SUCH TERM IS DEFINED IN

RULE 13A-15(F) AND RULE 15D-15(F) OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934, AS AMENDED. INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING IS A PROCESS DESIGNED TO PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING THE RELIABILITY OF FINANCIAL REPORTING AND THE

PREPARATION OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR EXTERNAL PURPOSES IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING INCLUDES THOSE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES THAT.

(I) PERTAIN TO THE MAINTENANCE OF RECORDS THAT, IN REASONABLE DETAIL, ACCURATELY AND FAIRLY REFLECT THE TRANSACTIONS AND DISPOSITIONS OF ASSETS OF THE COMPANY; (II) PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE THAT TRANSACTIONS ARE RECORDED AS NECESSARY

TO PERMIT PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES, AND THAT RECEIPTS AND EXPENDITURES OF THE COMPANY ARE BEING MADE ONLY IN ACCORDANCE WITH AUTHORIZATIONS OF OUR MANAGEMENT AND DIRECTORS; AND

(III) PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING PREVENTION OR TIMELY DETECTION OF UNAUTHORIZED ACQUISITION, USE OR DISPOSITION OF ASSETS OF THE COMPANY THAT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

WHILE REASONABLE ASSURANCE IS A HIGH LEVEL OF ASSURANCE, IT DOES NOT MEAN ABSOLUTE ASSURANCE. BECAUSE OF ITS INHERENT

LIMITATIONS, INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING MAY NOT PREVENT OR DETECT EVERY MISSTATEMENT AND INSTANCE OF FRAUD. CONTROLS ARE SUSCEPTIBLE TO MANIPULATION, ESPECIALLY IN INSTANCES OF FRAUD CAUSED BY THE COLLUSION OF TWO OR MORE PEOPLE,

INCLUDING OUR SENIOR MANAGEMENT. ALSO, PROJECTIONS OF ANY EVALUATION OF EFFECTIVENESS TO FUTURE PERIODS ARE SUBJECT TO THE RISK THAT CONTROLS MAY BECOME INADEQUATE BECAUSE OF CHANGES IN CONDITIONS, OR THAT THE DEGREE OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE POLICIES

OR PROCEDURES MAY DETERIORATE.

UNDER THE SUPERVISION AND WITH THE PARTICIPATION OF OUR CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND CHIEF

FINANCIAL OFFICER, OUR MANAGEMENT CONDUCTED AN EVALUATION OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING BASED UPON THE FRAMEWORK IN

ACCORDANCE WITH THE STANDARDS OF THE PUBLIC COMPANY ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BOARD (UNITED STATES). THOSE STANDARDS REQUIRE THAT WE PLAN AND PERFORM THE AUDITS TO OBTAIN REASONABLE ASSURANCE ABOUT WHETHER THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE FREE OF MATERIAL

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, ASSESSING THE ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES USED AND SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES MADE BY MANAGEMENT, AND EVALUATING THE OVERALL FINANCIAL STATEMENT PRESENTATION. OUR AUDIT OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING INCLUDED OBTAINING AN

UNDERSTANDING OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, ASSESSING THE RISK THAT A MATERIAL WEAKNESS EXISTS, AND TESTING AND EVALUATING THE DESIGN AND OPERATING EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL CONTROL BASED ON THE ASSESSED RISK. OUR AUDITS ALSO

OF ANY EVALUATION OF EFFECTIVENESS TO FUTURE PERIODS ARE SUBJECT TO THE RISK THAT CONTROLS MAY BECOME INADEQUATE BECAUSE OF CHANGES IN CONDITIONS, OR THAT THE DEGREE OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE POLICIES OR PROCEDURES MAY DETERIORATE.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 1  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS

NIKE, INC. IS A WORLDWIDE LEADER IN THE DESIGN, MARKETING AND DISTRIBUTION OF ATHLETIC AND SPORTS-INSPIRED FOOTWEAR, APPAREL, EQUIPMENT AND ACCESSORIES. WHOLLY-OWNED NIKE SUBSIDIARIES INCLUDE COLE HAAN,

WHICH DESIGNS, MARKETS AND DISTRIBUTES DRESS AND CASUAL SHOES, HANDBAGS, ACCESSORIES AND COATS; CONVERSE INC., WHICH DESIGNS, MARKETS AND DISTRIBUTES ATHLETIC AND CASUAL FOOTWEAR, APPAREL AND ACCESSORIES; HURLEY INTERNATIONAL LLC, WHICH DESIGNS,

MARKETS AND DISTRIBUTES ACTION SPORTS AND YOUTH LIFESTYLE FOOTWEAR, APPAREL AND ACCESSORIES; AND UMBRO INTERNATIONAL LIMITED, WHICH DESIGNS, DISTRIBUTES AND LICENSES ATHLETIC AND CASUAL FOOTWEAR, APPAREL AND EQUIPMENT, PRIMARILY FOR THE SPORT OF

SOCCER.

BASIS OF CONSOLIDATION

THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDE THE ACCOUNTS OF NIKE, INC. AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES (THE COMPANY). ALL SIGNIFICANT INTERCOMPANY TRANSACTIONS AND BALANCES HAVE BEEN ELIMINATED.

RECOGNITION OF REVENUES

WHOLESALE REVENUES ARE RECOGNIZED WHEN TITLE PASSES AND THE RISKS AND REWARDS OF OWNERSHIP HAVE PASSED TO THE CUSTOMER, BASED ON THE TERMS OF SALE. THIS OCCURS UPON SHIPMENT OR UPON RECEIPT BY THE

CUSTOMER DEPENDING ON THE COUNTRY OF THE SALE AND THE AGREEMENT WITH THE CUSTOMER. RETAIL STORE REVENUES ARE RECORDED AT THE TIME OF SALE. PROVISIONS FOR SALES DISCOUNTS, RETURNS AND MISCELLANEOUS CLAIMS FROM CUSTOMERS ARE MADE AT THE TIME OF SALE.

AS OF MAY 31, 2011 AND 2010, THE COMPANYS RESERVE BALANCES FOR SALES DISCOUNTS, RETURNS AND MISCELLANEOUS CLAIMS WERE $423 MILLION AND $371 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY.

SHIPPING AND HANDLING COSTS

SHIPPING AND HANDLING COSTS ARE

EXPENSED AS INCURRED AND INCLUDED IN COST OF SALES.

DEMAND CREATION EXPENSE

DEMAND CREATION EXPENSE CONSISTS OF ADVERTISING AND PROMOTION COSTS, INCLUDING COSTS OF ENDORSEMENT CONTRACTS, TELEVISION, DIGITAL AND

PRINT ADVERTISING, BRAND EVENTS, AND RETAIL BRAND PRESENTATION. ADVERTISING PRODUCTION COSTS ARE EXPENSED THE FIRST TIME AN ADVERTISEMENT IS RUN. ADVERTISING PLACEMENT COSTS ARE EXPENSED IN THE MONTH THE ADVERTISING APPEARS, WHILE COSTS RELATED TO

BRAND EVENTS ARE EXPENSED WHEN THE EVENT OCCURS. COSTS RELATED TO RETAIL BRAND PRESENTATION ARE EXPENSED WHEN THE PRESENTATION IS COMPLETED AND DELIVERED. A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF THE COMPANYS PROMOTIONAL EXPENSES RESULT FROM PAYMENTS UNDER

ENDORSEMENT CONTRACTS. ACCOUNTING FOR ENDORSEMENT PAYMENTS IS BASED UPON SPECIFIC CONTRACT PROVISIONS. GENERALLY, ENDORSEMENT PAYMENTS ARE EXPENSED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THE TERM OF THE CONTRACT AFTER GIVING RECOGNITION TO PERIODIC

PERFORMANCE COMPLIANCE PROVISIONS OF THE CONTRACTS. PREPAYMENTS MADE UNDER CONTRACTS ARE INCLUDED IN PREPAID EXPENSES OR OTHER ASSETS DEPENDING ON THE PERIOD TO WHICH THE PREPAYMENT APPLIES.

THROUGH COOPERATIVE ADVERTISING PROGRAMS, THE COMPANY REIMBURSES RETAIL CUSTOMERS FOR CERTAIN COSTS OF ADVERTISING THE COMPANYS

PRODUCTS. THE COMPANY RECORDS THESE COSTS IN SELLING AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE AT THE POINT IN TIME WHEN IT IS OBLIGATED TO ITS CUSTOMERS FOR THE COSTS, WHICH IS WHEN THE RELATED REVENUES ARE RECOGNIZED. THIS OBLIGATION MAY ARISE PRIOR TO THE

RELATED ADVERTISEMENT BEING RUN.

TOTAL ADVERTISING AND PROMOTION EXPENSES WERE $2,448 MILLION, $2,356 MILLION, AND $2,352

MILLION FOR THE YEARS ENDED MAY 31, 2011, 2010 AND 2009, RESPECTIVELY. PREPAID ADVERTISING AND PROMOTION EXPENSES RECORDED IN PREPAID EXPENSES AND OTHER ASSETS TOTALED $291 MILLION AND $261 MILLION AT MAY 31, 2011 AND 2010, RESPECTIVELY.

CASH AND EQUIVALENTS

CASH AND EQUIVALENTS REPRESENT CASH AND SHORT-TERM, HIGHLY LIQUID INVESTMENTS WITH MATURITIES OF THREE MONTHS OR LESS AT DATE OF PURCHASE.

THE CARRYING AMOUNTS REFLECTED IN THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET FOR CASH AND EQUIVALENTS APPROXIMATE FAIR VALUE.

SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS

SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS CONSIST OF HIGHLY LIQUID INVESTMENTS, INCLUDING COMMERCIAL PAPER, U.S. TREASURY, U.S. AGENCY, AND CORPORATE DEBT SECURITIES, WITH MATURITIES OVER THREE MONTHS FROM THE DATE OF

PURCHASE. DEBT SECURITIES THAT THE COMPANY HAS THE ABILITY AND POSITIVE INTENT TO HOLD TO MATURITY ARE CARRIED AT AMORTIZED COST. AT MAY 31, 2011 AND 2010, THE COMPANY DID NOT HOLD ANY SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS THAT WERE CLASSIFIED AS TRADING OR

HELD-TO-MATURITY.

AT MAY 31, 2011 AND 2010, SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS CONSISTED OF AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE SECURITIES.

AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE SECURITIES ARE RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE WITH UNREALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES REPORTED, NET OF TAX, IN OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME, UNLESS UNREALIZED LOSSES ARE DETERMINED TO BE OTHER THAN TEMPORARY. THE COMPANY CONSIDERS ALL

AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE SECURITIES, INCLUDING THOSE WITH MATURITY DATES BEYOND 12 MONTHS, AS AVAILABLE TO SUPPORT CURRENT OPERATIONAL LIQUIDITY NEEDS AND THEREFORE CLASSIFIES ALL SECURITIES WITH MATURITY DATES BEYOND THREE MONTHS AT THE DATE OF PURCHASE

AS CURRENT ASSETS WITHIN SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET.

SEE NOTE 6  FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

FOR MORE INFORMATION ON THE COMPANYS SHORT TERM INVESTMENTS.

ALLOWANCE FOR UNCOLLECTIBLE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE

ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE CONSISTS PRIMARILY OF AMOUNTS RECEIVABLE FROM CUSTOMERS. WE MAKE ONGOING ESTIMATES RELATING TO THE

COLLECTABILITY OF OUR ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND MAINTAIN AN ALLOWANCE FOR ESTIMATED LOSSES RESULTING FROM THE INABILITY OF OUR CUSTOMERS TO MAKE REQUIRED PAYMENTS. IN DETERMINING THE AMOUNT OF THE ALLOWANCE, WE CONSIDER OUR HISTORICAL LEVEL OF CREDIT

LOSSES AND MAKE JUDGMENTS ABOUT THE CREDITWORTHINESS OF SIGNIFICANT CUSTOMERS BASED ON ONGOING CREDIT EVALUATIONS. ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE WITH ANTICIPATED COLLECTION DATES GREATER THAN 12 MONTHS FROM THE BALANCE SHEET DATE AND RELATED ALLOWANCES ARE

CONSIDERED NON-CURRENT AND RECORDED IN OTHER ASSETS. THE ALLOWANCE FOR UNCOLLECTIBLE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE WAS $124 MILLION AND $117 MILLION AT MAY 31, 2011 AND 2010, RESPECTIVELY, OF WHICH $50 MILLION AND $43 MILLION WAS CLASSIFIED AS LONG-TERM

AND RECORDED IN OTHER ASSETS.

INVENTORY VALUATION

INVENTORIES ARE STATED AT LOWER OF COST OR MARKET AND VALUED ON A FIRST-IN, FIRST-OUT (FIFO) OR MOVING AVERAGE COST BASIS.

PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT AND DEPRECIATION

PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT ARE RECORDED AT COST. DEPRECIATION FOR FINANCIAL REPORTING PURPOSES IS DETERMINED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS

FOR BUILDINGS AND LEASEHOLD IMPROVEMENTS OVER 2 TO 40 YEARS AND FOR MACHINERY AND EQUIPMENT OVER 2 TO 15 YEARS. COMPUTER SOFTWARE (INCLUDING, IN SOME CASES, THE COST OF INTERNAL LABOR) IS DEPRECIATED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER 3 TO 10 YEARS.

IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS

THE COMPANY REVIEWS THE CARRYING VALUE OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS OR ASSET GROUPS TO BE USED IN OPERATIONS WHENEVER EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THAT THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF THE ASSETS MIGHT NOT

BE RECOVERABLE. FACTORS THAT WOULD NECESSITATE AN IMPAIRMENT ASSESSMENT INCLUDE A SIGNIFICANT ADVERSE CHANGE IN THE

61

TABLE OF CONTENTS

NIKE, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (CONTINUED)

EXTENT OR MANNER IN WHICH AN ASSET IS USED, A SIGNIFICANT ADVERSE CHANGE IN LEGAL FACTORS OR THE BUSINESS CLIMATE THAT COULD AFFECT THE VALUE OF THE ASSET, OR A SIGNIFICANT DECLINE IN THE

OBSERVABLE MARKET VALUE OF AN ASSET, AMONG OTHERS. IF SUCH FACTS INDICATE A POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT, THE COMPANY WOULD ASSESS THE RECOVERABILITY OF AN ASSET GROUP BY DETERMINING IF THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE ASSET GROUP EXCEEDS THE SUM OF THE PROJECTED

UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS EXPECTED TO RESULT FROM THE USE AND EVENTUAL DISPOSITION OF THE ASSETS OVER THE REMAINING ECONOMIC LIFE OF THE PRIMARY ASSET IN THE ASSET GROUP. IF THE RECOVERABILITY TEST INDICATES THAT THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE ASSET GROUP

IS NOT RECOVERABLE, THE COMPANY WILL ESTIMATE THE FAIR VALUE OF THE ASSET GROUP USING APPROPRIATE VALUATION METHODOLOGIES WHICH WOULD TYPICALLY INCLUDE AN ESTIMATE OF DISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS. ANY IMPAIRMENT WOULD BE MEASURED AS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN

THE ASSET GROUPS CARRYING AMOUNT AND ITS ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE.

IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND GOODWILL

THE COMPANY PERFORMS ANNUAL IMPAIRMENT TESTS ON GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS WITH INDEFINITE LIVES IN THE FOURTH

QUARTER OF EACH FISCAL YEAR, OR WHEN EVENTS OCCUR OR CIRCUMSTANCES CHANGE THAT WOULD, MORE LIKELY THAN NOT, REDUCE THE FAIR VALUE OF A REPORTING UNIT OR AN INTANGIBLE ASSET WITH AN INDEFINITE LIFE BELOW ITS CARRYING VALUE. EVENTS OR CHANGES IN

CIRCUMSTANCES THAT MAY TRIGGER INTERIM IMPAIRMENT REVIEWS INCLUDE SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN BUSINESS CLIMATE, OPERATING RESULTS, PLANNED INVESTMENTS IN THE REPORTING UNIT, OR AN EXPECTATION THAT THE CARRYING AMOUNT MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE, AMONG OTHER

FACTORS. THE IMPAIRMENT TEST REQUIRES THE COMPANY TO ESTIMATE THE FAIR VALUE OF ITS REPORTING UNITS. IF THE CARRYING VALUE OF A REPORTING UNIT EXCEEDS ITS FAIR VALUE, THE GOODWILL OF THAT REPORTING UNIT IS POTENTIALLY IMPAIRED AND THE COMPANY

PROCEEDS TO STEP TWO OF THE IMPAIRMENT ANALYSIS. IN STEP TWO OF THE ANALYSIS, THE COMPANY MEASURES AND RECORDS AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS EQUAL TO THE EXCESS OF THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE REPORTING UNITS GOODWILL OVER ITS IMPLIED FAIR VALUE SHOULD SUCH

A CIRCUMSTANCE ARISE.

THE COMPANY GENERALLY BASES ITS MEASUREMENT OF FAIR VALUE OF A REPORTING UNIT ON A BLENDED ANALYSIS OF

THE PRESENT VALUE OF FUTURE DISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS AND THE MARKET VALUATION APPROACH. THE DISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS MODEL INDICATES THE FAIR VALUE OF THE REPORTING UNIT BASED ON THE PRESENT VALUE OF THE CASH FLOWS THAT THE COMPANY EXPECTS THE REPORTING

UNIT TO GENERATE IN THE FUTURE. THE COMPANYS SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES IN THE DISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS MODEL INCLUDE: ITS WEIGHTED AVERAGE COST OF CAPITAL; LONG-TERM RATE OF GROWTH AND PROFITABILITY OF THE REPORTING UNITS BUSINESS; AND WORKING

CAPITAL EFFECTS. THE MARKET VALUATION APPROACH INDICATES THE FAIR VALUE OF THE BUSINESS BASED ON A COMPARISON OF THE REPORTING UNIT TO COMPARABLE PUBLICLY TRADED COMPANIES IN SIMILAR LINES OF BUSINESS. SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES IN THE MARKET VALUATION

APPROACH MODEL INCLUDE IDENTIFYING SIMILAR COMPANIES WITH COMPARABLE BUSINESS FACTORS SUCH AS SIZE, GROWTH, PROFITABILITY, RISK AND RETURN ON INVESTMENT, AND ASSESSING COMPARABLE REVENUE AND OPERATING INCOME MULTIPLES IN ESTIMATING THE FAIR VALUE OF

THE REPORTING UNIT.

THE COMPANY BELIEVES THE WEIGHTED USE OF DISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS AND THE MARKET VALUATION APPROACH IS THE

BEST METHOD FOR DETERMINING THE FAIR VALUE OF ITS REPORTING UNITS BECAUSE THESE ARE THE MOST COMMON VALUATION METHODOLOGIES USED WITHIN ITS INDUSTRY; AND THE BLENDED USE OF BOTH MODELS COMPENSATES FOR THE INHERENT RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH EITHER MODEL

IF USED ON A STAND-ALONE BASIS.

INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS PRIMARILY CONSIST OF ACQUIRED TRADE NAMES AND TRADEMARKS.

IN MEASURING THE FAIR VALUE FOR THESE INTANGIBLE ASSETS, THE COMPANY UTILIZES THE RELIEF-FROM-ROYALTY METHOD. THIS METHOD ASSUMES THAT TRADE NAMES AND TRADEMARKS HAVE VALUE TO THE EXTENT THAT THEIR OWNER IS RELIEVED OF THE OBLIGATION TO PAY

ROYALTIES FOR THE BENEFITS RECEIVED FROM THEM. THIS METHOD REQUIRES THE COMPANY TO ESTIMATE THE FUTURE REVENUE FOR THE RELATED BRANDS, THE APPROPRIATE ROYALTY RATE AND THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE COST OF CAPITAL.

FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION AND FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSACTIONS

ADJUSTMENTS RESULTING FROM TRANSLATING FOREIGN FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INTO U.S. DOLLARS ARE INCLUDED IN THE FOREIGN

CURRENCY TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENT, A COMPONENT OF ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME IN SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY.

62

TABLE OF CONTENTS

NIKE, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (CONTINUED)

THE COMPANYS GLOBAL SUBSIDIARIES HAVE VARIOUS ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, PRIMARILY

RECEIVABLES AND PAYABLES, THAT ARE DENOMINATED IN CURRENCIES OTHER THAN THEIR FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY. THESE BALANCE SHEET ITEMS ARE SUBJECT TO REMEASUREMENT, THE IMPACT OF WHICH IS RECORDED IN OTHER (INCOME), NET, WITHIN OUR CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF

INCOME.

ACCOUNTING FOR DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES

THE COMPANY USES DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS TO LIMIT EXPOSURE TO CHANGES IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES AND INTEREST RATES. ALL

DERIVATIVES ARE RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE ON THE BALANCE SHEET AND CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS ARE EITHER RECOGNIZED IN OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (A COMPONENT OF SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY), DEBT OR NET INCOME

DEPENDING ON THE NATURE OF THE UNDERLYING EXPOSURE, WHETHER THE DERIVATIVE IS FORMALLY DESIGNATED AS A HEDGE, AND, IF DESIGNATED, THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE HEDGE IS EFFECTIVE. THE COMPANY CLASSIFIES THE CASH FLOWS AT SETTLEMENT FROM DERIVATIVES IN THE

SAME CATEGORY AS THE CASH FLOWS FROM THE RELATED HEDGED ITEMS. FOR UNDESIGNATED HEDGES AND DESIGNATED CASH FLOW HEDGES, THIS IS WITHIN THE CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATIONS COMPONENT OF THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS. FOR DESIGNATED NET

INVESTMENT HEDGES, THIS IS GENERALLY WITHIN THE CASH USED BY INVESTING ACTIVITIES COMPONENT OF THE CASH FLOW STATEMENT. AS OUR FAIR VALUE HEDGES ARE RECEIVE-FIXED, PAY-VARIABLE INTEREST RATE SWAPS, THE CASH FLOWS ASSOCIATED WITH THESE DERIVATIVE

INSTRUMENTS ARE PERIODIC INTEREST PAYMENTS WHILE THE SWAPS ARE OUTSTANDING, WHICH ARE REFLECTED IN NET INCOME WITHIN THE CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATIONS COMPONENT OF THE CASH FLOW STATEMENT.

SEE NOTE 17  RISK MANAGEMENT AND DERIVATIVES FOR MORE INFORMATION ON THE COMPANYS RISK MANAGEMENT PROGRAM AND DERIVATIVES.

STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION

THE COMPANY ESTIMATES THE FAIR VALUE OF OPTIONS AND STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS GRANTED UNDER THE NIKE, INC. 1990 STOCK INCENTIVE PLAN (THE 1990 PLAN) AND EMPLOYEES PURCHASE RIGHTS UNDER

THE EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLANS (ESPPS) USING THE BLACK-SCHOLES OPTION PRICING MODEL. THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES THIS FAIR VALUE, NET OF ESTIMATED FORFEITURES, AS SELLING AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME

OVER THE VESTING PERIOD USING THE STRAIGHT-LINE METHOD.

SEE NOTE 11  COMMON STOCK AND STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION FOR MORE

INFORMATION ON THE COMPANYS STOCK PROGRAMS.

INCOME TAXES

THE COMPANY ACCOUNTS FOR INCOME TAXES USING THE ASSET AND LIABILITY METHOD. THIS APPROACH REQUIRES THE RECOGNITION OF DEFERRED TAX ASSETS

AND LIABILITIES FOR THE EXPECTED FUTURE TAX CONSEQUENCES OF TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE CARRYING AMOUNTS AND THE TAX BASIS OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. UNITED STATES INCOME TAXES ARE PROVIDED CURRENTLY ON FINANCIAL STATEMENT EARNINGS OF NON-U.S.

SUBSIDIARIES THAT ARE EXPECTED TO BE REPATRIATED. THE COMPANY DETERMINES ANNUALLY THE AMOUNT OF UNDISTRIBUTED NON-U.S. EARNINGS TO INVEST INDEFINITELY IN ITS NON-U.S. OPERATIONS. THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES INTEREST AND PENALTIES RELATED TO INCOME TAX

MATTERS IN INCOME TAX EXPENSE.

SEE NOTE 9  INCOME TAXES FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION.

EARNINGS PER SHARE

BASIC EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE IS CALCULATED BY DIVIDING NET INCOME BY THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE NUMBER OF COMMON SHARES OUTSTANDING DURING THE YEAR. DILUTED EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE IS CALCULATED BY

ADJUSTING WEIGHTED AVERAGE OUTSTANDING SHARES, ASSUMING CONVERSION OF ALL POTENTIALLY DILUTIVE STOCK OPTIONS AND AWARDS.

MANAGEMENT ESTIMATES

THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN CONFORMITY WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO MAKE ESTIMATES, INCLUDING ESTIMATES RELATING TO ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT THE

REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AND DISCLOSURE OF CONTINGENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AT THE DATE OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF REVENUES AND EXPENSES DURING THE REPORTING PERIOD. ACTUAL RESULTS COULD DIFFER FROM THESE

ESTIMATES.

RECENTLY ADOPTED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

IN JANUARY 2010, THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD (FASB) ISSUED GUIDANCE TO AMEND THE DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS RELATED

TO RECURRING AND NONRECURRING FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS. THE GUIDANCE REQUIRES ADDITIONAL DISCLOSURES ABOUT THE DIFFERENT CLASSES OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE, THE VALUATION TECHNIQUES AND INPUTS USED, THE ACTIVITY IN LEVEL 3 FAIR

VALUE MEASUREMENTS, AND THE TRANSFERS BETWEEN LEVELS 1, 2, AND 3 OF THE FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT HIERARCHY. THIS GUIDANCE BECAME EFFECTIVE FOR THE COMPANY BEGINNING MARCH 1, 2010, EXCEPT FOR DISCLOSURES RELATING TO PURCHASES, SALES, ISSUANCES AND

SETTLEMENTS OF LEVEL 3 ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, WHICH WILL BE EFFECTIVE FOR THE COMPANY BEGINNING JUNE 1, 2011. AS THIS GUIDANCE ONLY REQUIRES EXPANDED DISCLOSURES, THE ADOPTION DID NOT AND WILL NOT IMPACT THE COMPANYS CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL POSITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

IN JUNE 2009, THE FASB ISSUED A NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARD THAT REVISED THE

GUIDANCE FOR THE CONSOLIDATION OF VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES (VIE). THIS NEW GUIDANCE REQUIRES A QUALITATIVE APPROACH TO IDENTIFYING A CONTROLLING FINANCIAL INTEREST IN A VIE, AND REQUIRES AN ONGOING ASSESSMENT OF WHETHER AN ENTITY IS A

VIE AND WHETHER AN INTEREST IN A VIE MAKES THE HOLDER THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY OF THE VIE. THIS GUIDANCE BECAME EFFECTIVE FOR THE COMPANY BEGINNING JUNE 1, 2010. THE ADOPTION OF THIS GUIDANCE DID NOT HAVE AN IMPACT ON THE COMPANYS

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL POSITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

IN JUNE 2011, THE FASB ISSUED NEW GUIDANCE ON THE PRESENTATION OF COMPREHENSIVE INCOME. THIS NEW GUIDANCE REQUIRES THE COMPONENTS OF NET

INCOME AND OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME TO BE EITHER PRESENTED IN ONE CONTINUOUS STATEMENT, REFERRED TO AS THE STATEMENT OF COMPREHENSIVE INCOME, OR IN TWO SEPARATE, BUT CONSECUTIVE STATEMENTS. THIS NEW GUIDANCE ELIMINATES THE CURRENT OPTION TO REPORT

OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME AND ITS COMPONENTS IN THE STATEMENT OF SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY. WHILE THE NEW GUIDANCE CHANGES THE PRESENTATION OF COMPREHENSIVE INCOME, THERE ARE NO CHANGES TO THE COMPONENTS THAT ARE RECOGNIZED IN NET INCOME OR OTHER

COMPREHENSIVE INCOME UNDER CURRENT ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE. THIS NEW GUIDANCE IS EFFECTIVE FOR THE COMPANY BEGINNING JUNE 1, 2012. AS THIS GUIDANCE ONLY AMENDS THE PRESENTATION OF THE COMPONENTS OF COMPREHENSIVE INCOME, THE ADOPTION WILL NOT HAVE

AN IMPACT ON THE COMPANYS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL POSITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

IN APRIL 2011, THE FASB ISSUED NEW

GUIDANCE TO ACHIEVE COMMON FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT AND DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS BETWEEN U.S. GAAP AND INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL REPORTING STANDARDS. THIS NEW GUIDANCE, WHICH IS EFFECTIVE FOR THE COMPANY BEGINNING JUNE 1, 2012, AMENDS CURRENT U.S.

GAAP FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT AND DISCLOSURE GUIDANCE TO INCLUDE INCREASED TRANSPARENCY AROUND VALUATION INPUTS AND INVESTMENT CATEGORIZATION. THE COMPANY DOES NOT EXPECT THE ADOPTION WILL HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON ITS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL POSITION

OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (CONTINUED)

IN OCTOBER 2009, THE FASB ISSUED NEW STANDARDS THAT REVISED THE GUIDANCE FOR

REVENUE RECOGNITION WITH MULTIPLE DELIVERABLES. THESE NEW STANDARDS IMPACT THE DETERMINATION OF WHEN THE INDIVIDUAL DELIVERABLES INCLUDED IN A MULTIPLE-ELEMENT ARRANGEMENT MAY BE TREATED AS SEPARATE UNITS OF ACCOUNTING. ADDITIONALLY, THESE NEW

STANDARDS MODIFY THE MANNER IN WHICH THE TRANSACTION CONSIDERATION IS ALLOCATED ACROSS THE SEPARATELY IDENTIFIED DELIVERABLES BY NO LONGER PERMITTING THE RESIDUAL METHOD OF ALLOCATING ARRANGEMENT CONSIDERATION. THESE NEW STANDARDS ARE EFFECTIVE FOR

THE COMPANY BEGINNING JUNE 1, 2011. THE COMPANY DOES NOT EXPECT THE ADOPTION WILL HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON ITS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL POSITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

UMBRO IMPAIRMENT IN FISCAL 2009

THE COMPANY PERFORMS ANNUAL IMPAIRMENT TESTS ON GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS WITH INDEFINITE LIVES IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF EACH FISCAL

YEAR, OR WHEN EVENTS OCCUR OR CIRCUMSTANCES CHANGE THAT WOULD, MORE LIKELY THAN NOT, REDUCE THE FAIR VALUE OF A REPORTING UNIT OR INTANGIBLE ASSETS WITH AN INDEFINITE LIFE BELOW ITS CARRYING VALUE. AS A RESULT OF A SIGNIFICANT DECLINE IN GLOBAL

CONSUMER DEMAND AND CONTINUED WEAKNESS IN THE MACROECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT, AS WELL AS DECISIONS BY COMPANY MANAGEMENT TO ADJUST PLANNED INVESTMENT IN THE UMBRO BRAND, THE COMPANY CONCLUDED SUFFICIENT INDICATORS OF IMPAIRMENT EXISTED TO REQUIRE THE

PERFORMANCE OF AN INTERIM ASSESSMENT OF UMBROS GOODWILL AND INDEFINITE LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS AS OF FEBRUARY 1, 2009. ACCORDINGLY, THE COMPANY PERFORMED THE FIRST STEP OF THE GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT ASSESSMENT FOR UMBRO BY COMPARING THE

ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF UMBRO TO ITS CARRYING AMOUNT, AND DETERMINED THERE WAS A POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT OF GOODWILL AS THE CARRYING AMOUNT EXCEEDED THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE. THEREFORE, THE COMPANY PERFORMED THE SECOND STEP OF THE ASSESSMENT WHICH

COMPARED THE IMPLIED FAIR VALUE OF UMBROS GOODWILL TO THE BOOK VALUE OF GOODWILL. THE IMPLIED FAIR VALUE OF GOODWILL IS DETERMINED BY ALLOCATING THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF UMBRO TO ALL OF ITS ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, INCLUDING BOTH RECOGNIZED

AND UNRECOGNIZED INTANGIBLES, IN THE SAME MANNER AS GOODWILL WAS DETERMINED IN THE ORIGINAL BUSINESS COMBINATION.

THE COMPANY

MEASURED THE FAIR VALUE OF UMBRO BY USING AN EQUAL WEIGHTING OF THE FAIR VALUE IMPLIED BY A DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW ANALYSIS AND BY COMPARISONS WITH THE MARKET VALUES OF SIMILAR PUBLICLY TRADED COMPANIES. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THE BLENDED USE OF BOTH

MODELS COMPENSATES FOR THE INHERENT RISK ASSOCIATED WITH EITHER MODEL IF USED ON A STAND-ALONE BASIS, AND THIS COMBINATION IS INDICATIVE OF THE FACTORS A MARKET PARTICIPANT WOULD CONSIDER WHEN PERFORMING A SIMILAR VALUATION. THE FAIR VALUE OF

UMBROS INDEFINITE-LIVED TRADEMARK WAS

66

TABLE OF CONTENTS

NIKE, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (CONTINUED)

ESTIMATED USING THE RELIEF FROM ROYALTY METHOD, WHICH ASSUMES THAT THE TRADEMARK HAS VALUE TO THE EXTENT THAT UMBRO IS RELIEVED OF THE OBLIGATION TO PAY ROYALTIES FOR THE BENEFITS RECEIVED FROM

THE TRADEMARK. THE ASSESSMENTS OF THE COMPANY RESULTED IN THE RECOGNITION OF IMPAIRMENT CHARGES OF $199 MILLION AND $181 MILLION RELATED TO UMBROS GOODWILL AND TRADEMARK, RESPECTIVELY, FOR THE YEAR ENDED MAY 31, 2009. A TAX BENEFIT OF $55

MILLION WAS RECOGNIZED AS A RESULT OF THE TRADEMARK IMPAIRMENT CHARGE. IN ADDITION TO THE ABOVE IMPAIRMENT ANALYSIS, THE COMPANY DETERMINED AN EQUITY INVESTMENT HELD BY UMBRO WAS IMPAIRED, AND RECOGNIZED A CHARGE OF $21 MILLION RELATED TO THE

IMPAIRMENT OF THIS INVESTMENT. THESE CHARGES ARE INCLUDED IN THE COMPANYS OTHER CATEGORY FOR SEGMENT REPORTING PURPOSES.

THE DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW ANALYSIS CALCULATED THE FAIR VALUE OF UMBRO USING MANAGEMENTS BUSINESS PLANS AND PROJECTIONS AS THE BASIS FOR EXPECTED CASH FLOWS FOR THE NEXT 12 YEARS AND A 3% RESIDUAL

GROWTH RATE THEREAFTER. THE COMPANY USED A WEIGHTED AVERAGE DISCOUNT RATE OF 14% IN ITS ANALYSIS, WHICH WAS DERIVED PRIMARILY FROM PUBLISHED SOURCES AS WELL AS OUR ADJUSTMENT FOR INCREASED MARKET RISK GIVEN CURRENT MARKET CONDITIONS. OTHER

SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES USED IN THE DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW ANALYSIS INCLUDE THE RATES OF PROJECTED GROWTH AND PROFITABILITY OF UMBROS BUSINESS AND WORKING CAPITAL EFFECTS. THE MARKET VALUATION APPROACH INDICATES THE FAIR VALUE OF UMBRO BASED ON A

COMPARISON OF UMBRO TO PUBLICLY TRADED COMPANIES IN SIMILAR LINES OF BUSINESS. SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES IN THE MARKET VALUATION APPROACH INCLUDE IDENTIFYING SIMILAR COMPANIES WITH COMPARABLE BUSINESS FACTORS SUCH AS SIZE, GROWTH, PROFITABILITY, MIX OF

REVENUE GENERATED FROM LICENSED AND DIRECT DISTRIBUTION, AND RISK OF RETURN ON INVESTMENT.

HOLDING ALL OTHER ASSUMPTIONS

CONSTANT AT THE TEST DATE, A 100 BASIS POINT INCREASE IN THE DISCOUNT RATE WOULD REDUCE THE ADJUSTED CARRYING VALUE OF UMBROS NET ASSETS BY AN ADDITIONAL 12%.

NOTE 6  FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

THE COMPANY MEASURES CERTAIN FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AT FAIR VALUE ON A RECURRING BASIS, INCLUDING DERIVATIVES

AND AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE SECURITIES. FAIR VALUE IS A MARKET-BASED MEASUREMENT THAT SHOULD BE DETERMINED BASED ON THE ASSUMPTIONS THAT MARKET PARTICIPANTS WOULD USE IN PRICING AN ASSET OR LIABILITY. AS A BASIS FOR

67

TABLE OF CONTENTS

NIKE, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (CONTINUED)

CONSIDERING SUCH ASSUMPTIONS, THE COMPANY USES A THREE-LEVEL HIERARCHY ESTABLISHED BY THE FASB THAT PRIORITIZES FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS BASED ON THE TYPES OF INPUTS USED FOR THE VARIOUS VALUATION

TECHNIQUES (MARKET APPROACH, INCOME APPROACH, AND COST APPROACH).

THE LEVELS OF HIERARCHY ARE DESCRIBED BELOW.



LEVEL 1: OBSERVABLE INPUTS SUCH AS QUOTED PRICES IN ACTIVE MARKETS FOR IDENTICAL ASSETS OR LIABILITIES.



LEVEL 2: INPUTS OTHER THAN QUOTED PRICES THAT ARE OBSERVABLE FOR THE ASSET OR LIABILITY, EITHER DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY; THESE INCLUDE QUOTED

PRICES FOR SIMILAR ASSETS OR LIABILITIES IN ACTIVE MARKETS AND QUOTED PRICES FOR IDENTICAL OR SIMILAR ASSETS OR LIABILITIES IN MARKETS THAT ARE NOT ACTIVE.



LEVEL 3: UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS IN WHICH THERE IS LITTLE OR NO MARKET DATA AVAILABLE, WHICH REQUIRE THE REPORTING ENTITY TO DEVELOP ITS OWN

ASSUMPTIONS.

THE COMPANYS ASSESSMENT OF THE SIGNIFICANCE OF A PARTICULAR INPUT TO THE FAIR VALUE

MEASUREMENT IN ITS ENTIRETY REQUIRES JUDGMENT AND CONSIDERS FACTORS SPECIFIC TO THE ASSET OR LIABILITY. FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE CLASSIFIED IN THEIR ENTIRETY BASED ON THE MOST STRINGENT LEVEL OF INPUT THAT IS SIGNIFICANT TO THE FAIR

VALUE MEASUREMENT.

THE FOLLOWING TABLE PRESENTS INFORMATION ABOUT THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES

MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE ON A RECURRING BASIS AS OF MAY 31, 2011 AND 2010 AND INDICATES THE FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY OF THE VALUATION TECHNIQUES UTILIZED BY THE COMPANY TO DETERMINE SUCH FAIR VALUE.

AS OF MAY 31, 2011, THE TOTAL GROSS UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS, EXCLUDING RELATED

INTEREST AND PENALTIES, WERE $212 MILLION, $93 MILLION OF WHICH WOULD AFFECT THE COMPANYS EFFECTIVE TAX RATE IF RECOGNIZED IN FUTURE PERIODS. TOTAL GROSS UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS, EXCLUDING INTEREST AND PENALTIES, AS OF MAY 31, 2010 AND

2009 WAS $282 MILLION AND $274 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY.

THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES INTEREST AND PENALTIES RELATED TO INCOME TAX

MATTERS IN INCOME TAX EXPENSE. THE LIABILITY FOR PAYMENT OF INTEREST AND PENALTIES INCREASED $10 MILLION, $6 MILLION, AND $2 MILLION DURING THE YEARS ENDED MAY 31, 2011, 2010, AND 2009, RESPECTIVELY. AS OF MAY 31, 2011 AND 2010, ACCRUED

INTEREST AND PENALTIES RELATED TO UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS WAS $91 MILLION AND $81 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY (EXCLUDING FEDERAL BENEFIT).

THE COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO TAXATION PRIMARILY IN THE U.S., CHINA AND THE NETHERLANDS AS WELL AS VARIOUS STATE AND OTHER FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS. THE COMPANY HAS CONCLUDED SUBSTANTIALLY ALL U.S. FEDERAL

INCOME TAX MATTERS THROUGH FISCAL YEAR 2009. THE COMPANY IS CURRENTLY UNDER AUDIT BY THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE FOR THE 2010 TAX YEAR. THE COMPANYS MAJOR FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS, CHINA AND THE NETHERLANDS, HAVE CONCLUDED SUBSTANTIALLY ALL

INCOME TAX MATTERS THROUGH CALENDAR 2000 AND FISCAL 2005, RESPECTIVELY. THE COMPANY ESTIMATES THAT IT IS REASONABLY POSSIBLE THAT THE TOTAL GROSS UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS COULD DECREASE BY UP TO $69 MILLION WITHIN THE NEXT 12 MONTHS AS A RESULT OF

RESOLUTIONS OF GLOBAL TAX EXAMINATIONS AND THE EXPIRATION OF APPLICABLE STATUTES OF LIMITATIONS.

THE COMPANY HAS INDEFINITELY

REINVESTED APPROXIMATELY $4.4 BILLION OF THE CUMULATIVE UNDISTRIBUTED EARNINGS OF CERTAIN FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES. SUCH EARNINGS WOULD BE SUBJECT TO U.S. TAXATION IF REPATRIATED TO THE U.S. DETERMINATION OF THE AMOUNT OF UNRECOGNIZED DEFERRED TAX

LIABILITY ASSOCIATED WITH THE INDEFINITELY REINVESTED CUMULATIVE UNDISTRIBUTED EARNINGS IS NOT PRACTICABLE.

A PORTION OF THE

COMPANYS FOREIGN OPERATIONS ARE BENEFITTING FROM A TAX HOLIDAY THAT WILL PHASE OUT IN 2019. THE DECREASE IN INCOME TAX EXPENSE FOR THE YEAR ENDED MAY 31, 2011 AS A RESULT OF THIS ARRANGEMENT WAS APPROXIMATELY $36 MILLION ($0.07 PER

DILUTED SHARE) AND $30 MILLION ($0.06 PER DILUTED SHARE) FOR THE YEAR ENDED MAY 31, 2010.

DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AT

MAY 31, 2011 AND 2010 WERE REDUCED BY A VALUATION ALLOWANCE RELATING TO TAX BENEFITS OF CERTAIN SUBSIDIARIES WITH OPERATING LOSSES WHERE IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT THE DEFERRED TAX ASSETS WILL NOT BE REALIZED. THE NET CHANGE IN THE

VALUATION ALLOWANCE WAS AN INCREASE OF $15 MILLION AND $10 MILLION FOR THE YEARS ENDED MAY 31, 2011 AND 2010, RESPECTIVELY AND A DECREASE OF $15 MILLION FOR THE YEAR ENDED MAY 31, 2009.

THE COMPANY DOES NOT ANTICIPATE THAT ANY FOREIGN TAX CREDIT CARRY-FORWARDS WILL EXPIRE. THE COMPANY HAS AVAILABLE DOMESTIC AND FOREIGN

LOSS CARRY-FORWARDS OF $183 MILLION AT MAY 31, 2011. SUCH LOSSES WILL EXPIRE AS FOLLOWS.

NOTE 16  RESTRUCTURING CHARGES

DURING FISCAL 2009, THE COMPANY TOOK NECESSARY STEPS TO STREAMLINE ITS MANAGEMENT STRUCTURE, ENHANCE CONSUMER FOCUS,

DRIVE INNOVATION MORE QUICKLY TO MARKET AND ESTABLISH A MORE SCALABLE, LONG-TERM COST STRUCTURE. AS A RESULT, THE COMPANY REDUCED ITS GLOBAL WORKFORCE BY APPROXIMATELY 5% AND INCURRED PRE-TAX RESTRUCTURING CHARGES OF $195 MILLION, PRIMARILY

CONSISTING OF SEVERANCE COSTS RELATED TO THE WORKFORCE REDUCTION. AS NEARLY ALL OF THE RESTRUCTURING ACTIVITIES WERE COMPLETED IN FISCAL 2009, THE COMPANY DID NOT RECOGNIZE ADDITIONAL COSTS RELATING TO THESE ACTIONS. THE RESTRUCTURING CHARGE IS

REFLECTED IN THE CORPORATE EXPENSE LINE IN THE SEGMENT PRESENTATION OF EARNINGS BEFORE INTEREST AND TAXES IN NOTE 18  OPERATING SEGMENTS AND RELATED INFORMATION. THE RESTRUCTURING ACCRUAL INCLUDED IN ACCRUED LIABILITIES IN THE

CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET WAS $3 MILLION AND $8 MILLION AS OF MAY 31, 2011 AND 2010, RESPECTIVELY.

NOTE 17  RISK MANAGEMENT AND DERIVATIVES

THE COMPANY IS EXPOSED TO GLOBAL MARKET RISKS, INCLUDING THE EFFECT OF CHANGES IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES AND

INTEREST RATES, AND USES DERIVATIVES TO MANAGE FINANCIAL EXPOSURES THAT OCCUR IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS. THE COMPANY DOES NOT HOLD OR ISSUE DERIVATIVES FOR TRADING PURPOSES.

THE COMPANY FORMALLY DOCUMENTS ALL RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN FORMALLY DESIGNATED HEDGING INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGED ITEMS, AS WELL AS ITS RISK

MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVE AND STRATEGY FOR UNDERTAKING HEDGE TRANSACTIONS. THIS PROCESS INCLUDES LINKING ALL DERIVATIVES TO EITHER SPECIFIC FIRM COMMITMENTS OR FORECASTED TRANSACTIONS. THE COMPANY ALSO ENTERS INTO FOREIGN EXCHANGE FORWARDS TO MITIGATE

THE CHANGE IN FAIR VALUE OF SPECIFIC ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ON THE BALANCE SHEET, WHICH ARE NOT DESIGNATED AS HEDGING INSTRUMENTS UNDER THE ACCOUNTING STANDARDS FOR DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING. ACCORDINGLY, CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THESE

NON-DESIGNATED INSTRUMENTS OF RECORDED BALANCE SHEET POSITIONS ARE RECOGNIZED IMMEDIATELY IN OTHER (INCOME), NET, ON THE INCOME STATEMENT TOGETHER WITH THE TRANSACTION GAIN OR LOSS FROM THE HEDGED BALANCE SHEET POSITION. THE COMPANY CLASSIFIES THE

CASH FLOWS AT SETTLEMENT FROM THESE UNDESIGNATED INSTRUMENTS IN THE SAME CATEGORY AS THE CASH FLOWS FROM THE RELATED HEDGED ITEMS, GENERALLY WITHIN THE CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATIONS COMPONENT OF THE CASH FLOW STATEMENT.

THE MAJORITY OF DERIVATIVES OUTSTANDING AS OF MAY 31, 2011 ARE DESIGNATED AS CASH FLOW, FAIR VALUE OR NET INVESTMENT HEDGES. ALL

DERIVATIVES ARE RECOGNIZED ON THE BALANCE SHEET AT THEIR FAIR VALUE AND CLASSIFIED BASED ON THE INSTRUMENTS MATURITY DATE. THE TOTAL NOTIONAL AMOUNT OF OUTSTANDING DERIVATIVES AS OF MAY 31, 2011 WAS $7 BILLION, WHICH IS PRIMARILY

COMPRISED OF CASH FLOW HEDGES FOR EURO/U.S. DOLLAR, BRITISH POUND/EURO, AND JAPANESE YEN/U.S. DOLLAR CURRENCY PAIRS.

CASH FLOW HEDGES

THE PURPOSE OF THE COMPANYS FOREIGN CURRENCY HEDGING ACTIVITIES IS TO PROTECT THE COMPANY FROM THE RISK THAT THE EVENTUAL CASH FLOWS

RESULTING FROM TRANSACTIONS IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES, INCLUDING REVENUES, PRODUCT COSTS, SELLING AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE, INVESTMENTS IN U.S. DOLLAR-DENOMINATED AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE DEBT SECURITIES AND INTERCOMPANY TRANSACTIONS, INCLUDING INTERCOMPANY

BORROWINGS, WILL BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY CHANGES IN EXCHANGE RATES. IT IS THE COMPANYS POLICY TO UTILIZE DERIVATIVES TO REDUCE FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISKS WHERE INTERNAL NETTING STRATEGIES CANNOT BE EFFECTIVELY EMPLOYED. HEDGED TRANSACTIONS ARE

DENOMINATED PRIMARILY IN EUROS, BRITISH POUNDS AND JAPANESE YEN. THE COMPANY HEDGES UP TO 100% OF ANTICIPATED EXPOSURES TYPICALLY 12 MONTHS IN ADVANCE, BUT HAS HEDGED AS MUCH AS 34 MONTHS IN ADVANCE.

ALL CHANGES IN FAIR VALUES OF OUTSTANDING CASH FLOW HEDGE DERIVATIVES, EXCEPT THE INEFFECTIVE PORTION, ARE RECORDED IN OTHER

COMPREHENSIVE INCOME UNTIL NET INCOME IS AFFECTED BY THE VARIABILITY OF CASH FLOWS OF THE HEDGED TRANSACTION. IN MOST CASES, AMOUNTS RECORDED IN OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME WILL BE RELEASED TO NET INCOME SOME TIME AFTER THE MATURITY OF THE RELATED

DERIVATIVE. THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF INCOME CLASSIFICATION OF EFFECTIVE HEDGE RESULTS IS THE SAME AS THAT OF THE UNDERLYING EXPOSURE. RESULTS OF HEDGES OF REVENUE AND PRODUCT COSTS ARE RECORDED IN REVENUE AND COST OF SALES, RESPECTIVELY, WHEN

THE UNDERLYING HEDGED TRANSACTION AFFECTS NET INCOME. RESULTS OF HEDGES OF SELLING AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE ARE RECORDED TOGETHER WITH THOSE COSTS WHEN THE RELATED EXPENSE IS RECORDED. RESULTS OF HEDGES OF FORECASTED PURCHASES OF U.S.

DOLLAR-DENOMINATED AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE SECURITIES ARE RECORDED IN OTHER (INCOME), NET WHEN THE SECURITIES ARE SOLD. RESULTS OF HEDGES OF FORECASTED INTERCOMPANY TRANSACTIONS ARE RECORDED IN OTHER (INCOME), NET WHEN THE TRANSACTION OCCURS. THE COMPANY

CLASSIFIES THE CASH FLOWS AT SETTLEMENT FROM THESE DESIGNATED CASH FLOW HEDGE DERIVATIVES IN THE SAME CATEGORY AS THE CASH FLOWS FROM THE RELATED HEDGED ITEMS, GENERALLY WITHIN THE CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATIONS COMPONENT OF THE CASH FLOW STATEMENT.

PREMIUMS PAID ON OPTIONS ARE INITIALLY RECORDED AS DEFERRED CHARGES. THE COMPANY ASSESSES THE EFFECTIVENESS OF OPTIONS BASED

ON THE TOTAL CASH FLOWS METHOD AND RECORDS TOTAL CHANGES IN THE OPTIONS FAIR VALUE TO OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME TO THE DEGREE THEY ARE EFFECTIVE.

81

TABLE OF CONTENTS

NIKE, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (CONTINUED)

AS OF MAY 31, 2011, $120 MILLION OF DEFERRED NET LOSSES (NET OF TAX) ON BOTH

OUTSTANDING AND MATURED DERIVATIVES ACCUMULATED IN OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME ARE EXPECTED TO BE RECLASSIFIED TO NET INCOME DURING THE NEXT 12 MONTHS AS A RESULT OF UNDERLYING HEDGED TRANSACTIONS ALSO BEING RECORDED IN NET INCOME. ACTUAL AMOUNTS

ULTIMATELY RECLASSIFIED TO NET INCOME ARE DEPENDENT ON THE EXCHANGE RATES IN EFFECT WHEN DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS THAT ARE CURRENTLY OUTSTANDING MATURE. AS OF MAY 31, 2011, THE MAXIMUM TERM OVER WHICH THE COMPANY IS HEDGING EXPOSURES TO THE

VARIABILITY OF CASH FLOWS FOR ITS FORECASTED AND RECORDED TRANSACTIONS IS 15 MONTHS.

THE COMPANY FORMALLY ASSESSES BOTH AT A

HEDGES INCEPTION AND ON AN ONGOING BASIS, WHETHER THE DERIVATIVES THAT ARE USED IN THE HEDGING TRANSACTION HAVE BEEN HIGHLY EFFECTIVE IN OFFSETTING CHANGES IN THE CASH FLOWS OF HEDGED ITEMS AND WHETHER THOSE DERIVATIVES MAY BE EXPECTED TO

REMAIN HIGHLY EFFECTIVE IN FUTURE PERIODS. EFFECTIVENESS FOR CASH FLOW HEDGES IS ASSESSED BASED ON FORWARD RATES. WHEN IT IS DETERMINED THAT A DERIVATIVE IS NOT, OR HAS CEASED TO BE, HIGHLY EFFECTIVE AS A HEDGE, THE COMPANY DISCONTINUES HEDGE

ACCOUNTING.

THE COMPANY DISCONTINUES HEDGE ACCOUNTING PROSPECTIVELY WHEN (1) IT DETERMINES THAT THE DERIVATIVE IS NO

LONGER HIGHLY EFFECTIVE IN OFFSETTING CHANGES IN THE CASH FLOWS OF A HEDGED ITEM (INCLUDING HEDGED ITEMS SUCH AS FIRM COMMITMENTS OR FORECASTED TRANSACTIONS); (2) THE DERIVATIVE EXPIRES OR IS SOLD, TERMINATED, OR EXERCISED; (3) IT IS NO

LONGER PROBABLE THAT THE FORECASTED TRANSACTION WILL OCCUR; OR (4) MANAGEMENT DETERMINES THAT DESIGNATING THE DERIVATIVE AS A HEDGING INSTRUMENT IS NO LONGER APPROPRIATE.

WHEN THE COMPANY DISCONTINUES HEDGE ACCOUNTING BECAUSE IT IS NO LONGER PROBABLE THAT THE FORECASTED TRANSACTION WILL OCCUR IN THE ORIGINALLY EXPECTED PERIOD, BUT IS EXPECTED TO OCCUR WITHIN AN ADDITIONAL

TWO-MONTH PERIOD OF TIME THEREAFTER, THE GAIN OR LOSS ON THE DERIVATIVE REMAINS IN ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME AND IS RECLASSIFIED TO NET INCOME WHEN THE FORECASTED TRANSACTION AFFECTS NET INCOME. HOWEVER, IF IT IS PROBABLE THAT A

FORECASTED TRANSACTION WILL NOT OCCUR BY THE END OF THE ORIGINALLY SPECIFIED TIME PERIOD OR WITHIN AN ADDITIONAL TWO-MONTH PERIOD OF TIME THEREAFTER, THE GAINS AND LOSSES THAT WERE ACCUMULATED IN OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME WILL BE RECOGNIZED

IMMEDIATELY IN NET INCOME. IN ALL SITUATIONS IN WHICH HEDGE ACCOUNTING IS DISCONTINUED AND THE DERIVATIVE REMAINS OUTSTANDING, THE COMPANY WILL CARRY THE DERIVATIVE AT ITS FAIR VALUE ON THE BALANCE SHEET, RECOGNIZING FUTURE CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE

IN OTHER (INCOME), NET. FOR THE YEAR ENDED MAY 31, 2011 AN IMMATERIAL AMOUNT OF INEFFECTIVENESS WAS RECORDED TO OTHER (INCOME), NET. FOR THE YEARS ENDED MAY 31, 2010 AND 2009, THE COMPANY RECORDED IN OTHER (INCOME), NET $5 MILLION GAIN AND

AN IMMATERIAL AMOUNT OF INEFFECTIVENESS FROM CASH FLOW HEDGES, RESPECTIVELY.

FAIR VALUE HEDGES

THE COMPANY IS ALSO EXPOSED TO THE RISK OF CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF CERTAIN FIXED-RATE DEBT ATTRIBUTABLE TO CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES.

DERIVATIVES CURRENTLY USED BY THE COMPANY TO HEDGE THIS RISK ARE RECEIVE-FIXED, PAY-VARIABLE INTEREST RATE SWAPS. AS OF MAY 31, 2011, ALL INTEREST RATE SWAP AGREEMENTS ARE DESIGNATED AS FAIR VALUE HEDGES OF THE RELATED LONG-TERM DEBT AND MEET

THE SHORTCUT METHOD REQUIREMENTS UNDER THE ACCOUNTING STANDARDS FOR DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING. ACCORDINGLY, CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUES OF THE INTEREST RATE SWAP AGREEMENTS ARE EXACTLY OFFSET BY CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE UNDERLYING LONG-TERM

DEBT. THE CASH FLOWS ASSOCIATED WITH THE COMPANYS FAIR VALUE HEDGES ARE PERIODIC INTEREST PAYMENTS WHILE THE SWAPS ARE OUTSTANDING, WHICH ARE REFLECTED IN NET INCOME WITHIN THE CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATIONS COMPONENT OF THE CASH FLOW STATEMENT.

NO INEFFECTIVENESS HAS BEEN RECORDED TO NET INCOME RELATED TO INTEREST RATE SWAPS DESIGNATED AS FAIR VALUE HEDGES FOR THE YEARS ENDED MAY 31, 2011, 2010, AND 2009.

IN FISCAL 2003, THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO A RECEIVE-FLOATING, PAY-FIXED INTEREST RATE SWAP AGREEMENT RELATED TO A JAPANESE YEN DENOMINATED INTERCOMPANY LOAN WITH ONE OF THE COMPANYS JAPANESE

SUBSIDIARIES. THIS INTEREST RATE SWAP WAS NOT DESIGNATED AS A HEDGE UNDER THE ACCOUNTING STANDARDS FOR DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING.

82

TABLE OF CONTENTS

NIKE, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (CONTINUED)

ACCORDINGLY, CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE SWAP WERE RECORDED TO NET INCOME EACH PERIOD THROUGH MATURITY AS A COMPONENT OF INTEREST EXPENSE (INCOME), NET. BOTH THE INTERCOMPANY LOAN AND THE

RELATED INTEREST RATE SWAP MATURED DURING THE YEAR ENDED MAY 31, 2009.

NET INVESTMENT HEDGES

THE COMPANY ALSO HEDGES THE RISK OF VARIABILITY IN FOREIGN-CURRENCY-DENOMINATED NET INVESTMENTS IN WHOLLY-OWNED INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS.

ALL CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE OF THE DERIVATIVES DESIGNATED AS NET INVESTMENT HEDGES, EXCEPT INEFFECTIVE PORTIONS, ARE REPORTED IN THE CUMULATIVE TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENT COMPONENT OF OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME ALONG WITH THE FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION

ADJUSTMENTS ON THOSE INVESTMENTS. THE COMPANY CLASSIFIES THE CASH FLOWS AT SETTLEMENT OF ITS NET INVESTMENT HEDGES WITHIN THE CASH USED BY INVESTING COMPONENT OF THE CASH FLOW STATEMENT. THE COMPANY ASSESSES HEDGE EFFECTIVENESS BASED ON CHANGES IN

FORWARD RATES. THE COMPANY RECORDED NO INEFFECTIVENESS FROM ITS NET INVESTMENT HEDGES FOR THE YEARS ENDED MAY 31, 2011, 2010, AND 2009.

CREDIT RISK

THE COMPANY IS EXPOSED TO CREDIT-RELATED LOSSES IN THE

EVENT OF NON-PERFORMANCE BY COUNTERPARTIES TO HEDGING INSTRUMENTS. THE COUNTERPARTIES TO ALL DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS ARE MAJOR FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS WITH INVESTMENT GRADE CREDIT RATINGS. HOWEVER, THIS DOES NOT ELIMINATE THE COMPANYS EXPOSURE

TO CREDIT RISK WITH THESE INSTITUTIONS. THIS CREDIT RISK IS LIMITED TO THE UNREALIZED GAINS IN SUCH CONTRACTS SHOULD ANY OF THESE COUNTERPARTIES FAIL TO PERFORM AS CONTRACTED. TO MANAGE THIS RISK, THE COMPANY HAS ESTABLISHED STRICT COUNTERPARTY

CREDIT GUIDELINES THAT ARE CONTINUALLY MONITORED AND REPORTED TO SENIOR MANAGEMENT ACCORDING TO PRESCRIBED GUIDELINES. THE COMPANY ALSO UTILIZES A PORTFOLIO OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS EITHER HEADQUARTERED OR OPERATING IN THE SAME COUNTRIES THE

COMPANY CONDUCTS ITS BUSINESS.

THE COMPANYS DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS CONTAIN CREDIT RISK RELATED CONTINGENT FEATURES AIMING

TO PROTECT AGAINST SIGNIFICANT DETERIORATION IN COUNTERPARTIES CREDITWORTHINESS AND THEIR ULTIMATE ABILITY TO SETTLE OUTSTANDING DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS. THE COMPANYS BILATERAL CREDIT RELATED CONTINGENT

FEATURES REQUIRE THE OWING ENTITY, EITHER THE COMPANY OR THE DERIVATIVE COUNTERPARTY, TO POST COLLATERAL SHOULD THE FAIR VALUE OF OUTSTANDING DERIVATIVES PER COUNTERPARTY BE GREATER THAN $50 MILLION. ADDITIONALLY, A CERTAIN LEVEL OF DECLINE IN

CREDIT RATING OF EITHER THE COMPANY OR THE COUNTERPARTY COULD TRIGGER COLLATERAL REQUIREMENTS. AS OF MAY 31, 2011, THE COMPANY WAS IN COMPLIANCE WITH ALL SUCH CREDIT RISK RELATED CONTINGENT FEATURES. THE AGGREGATE FAIR VALUE OF DERIVATIVE

INSTRUMENTS WITH CREDIT RISK RELATED CONTINGENT FEATURES THAT ARE IN A NET LIABILITY POSITION AT MAY 31, 2011 WAS $160 MILLION. THE COMPANY, OR ANY COUNTERPARTY, WERE NOT REQUIRED TO POST ANY COLLATERAL AS A RESULT OF THESE CONTINGENT FEATURES.

AS A RESULT OF THE ABOVE CONSIDERATIONS, THE COMPANY CONSIDERS THE IMPACT OF THE RISK OF COUNTERPARTY DEFAULT TO BE IMMATERIAL.

NOTE 18  OPERATING SEGMENTS AND RELATED INFORMATION

OPERATING SEGMENTS.

THE COMPANYS OPERATING SEGMENTS ARE EVIDENCE OF THE STRUCTURE

OF THE COMPANYS INTERNAL ORGANIZATION. THE MAJOR SEGMENTS ARE DEFINED BY GEOGRAPHIC REGIONS FOR OPERATIONS PARTICIPATING IN NIKE BRAND SALES ACTIVITY EXCLUDING NIKE GOLF. EACH NIKE BRAND GEOGRAPHIC SEGMENT OPERATES PREDOMINANTLY IN ONE

INDUSTRY: THE DESIGN, DEVELOPMENT, MARKETING AND SELLING OF ATHLETIC FOOTWEAR, APPAREL, AND EQUIPMENT. IN FISCAL 2009, THE COMPANY INITIATED A REORGANIZATION OF THE NIKE BRAND INTO A NEW MODEL CONSISTING OF SIX GEOGRAPHIES. EFFECTIVE

JUNE 1, 2009, THE COMPANYS NEW REPORTABLE OPERATING SEGMENTS FOR THE NIKE BRAND ARE: NORTH AMERICA, WESTERN EUROPE, CENTRAL AND EASTERN EUROPE, GREATER CHINA, JAPAN, AND EMERGING MARKETS. PREVIOUSLY, NIKE BRAND OPERATIONS WERE ORGANIZED

INTO THE FOLLOWING FOUR GEOGRAPHIC REGIONS: U.S., EUROPE, MIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA (COLLECTIVELY, EMEA), ASIA PACIFIC, AND AMERICAS. THE COMPANYS NIKE BRAND DIRECT TO CONSUMER OPERATIONS ARE MANAGED WITHIN EACH GEOGRAPHIC SEGMENT.

THE COMPANYS OTHER CATEGORY IS BROKEN INTO TWO COMPONENTS FOR

PRESENTATION PURPOSES TO ALIGN WITH THE WAY MANAGEMENT VIEWS THE COMPANY. THE GLOBAL BRAND DIVISIONS CATEGORY PRIMARILY REPRESENTS NIKE BRAND LICENSING BUSINESSES THAT ARE NOT PART OF A GEOGRAPHIC OPERATING SEGMENT, SELLING, GENERAL AND

ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES THAT ARE CENTRALLY MANAGED FOR THE NIKE BRAND AND COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT AND SUPPLY CHAIN OPERATIONS. THE OTHER BUSINESSES CATEGORY PRIMARILY CONSISTS OF THE ACTIVITIES OF OUR AFFILIATE

BRANDS; COLE HAAN, CONVERSE INC., HURLEY INTERNATIONAL LLC AND UMBRO INTERNATIONAL LIMITED; AND NIKE GOLF. ACTIVITIES REPRESENTED IN THE OTHER CATEGORY ARE IMMATERIAL FOR INDIVIDUAL DISCLOSURE.

REVENUES AS SHOWN BELOW REPRESENT SALES TO EXTERNAL CUSTOMERS FOR EACH SEGMENT. INTERCOMPANY REVENUES HAVE BEEN ELIMINATED AND ARE

IMMATERIAL FOR SEPARATE DISCLOSURE.

CORPORATE CONSISTS OF UNALLOCATED GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES, WHICH INCLUDES

EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH CENTRALLY MANAGED DEPARTMENTS, DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION RELATED TO THE COMPANYS HEADQUARTERS, UNALLOCATED INSURANCE AND BENEFIT PROGRAMS, INCLUDING STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION, CERTAIN FOREIGN CURRENCY GAINS AND

LOSSES, INCLUDING HEDGE GAINS AND LOSSES, CERTAIN CORPORATE ELIMINATIONS AND OTHER ITEMS.

EFFECTIVE JUNE 1, 2009, THE

PRIMARY FINANCIAL MEASURE USED BY THE COMPANY TO EVALUATE PERFORMANCE OF INDIVIDUAL OPERATING SEGMENTS IS EARNINGS BEFORE INTEREST AND TAXES (COMMONLY REFERRED TO AS EBIT) WHICH REPRESENTS NET INCOME BEFORE INTEREST EXPENSE (INCOME), NET

AND INCOME TAXES IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME. RECONCILING ITEMS FOR EBIT REPRESENT CORPORATE EXPENSE ITEMS THAT ARE NOT ALLOCATED TO THE OPERATING SEGMENTS FOR MANAGEMENT REPORTING. PREVIOUSLY, THE COMPANY EVALUATED PERFORMANCE OF

INDIVIDUAL OPERATING SEGMENTS BASED ON PRE-TAX INCOME OR INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES.

AS PART OF THE COMPANYS CENTRALLY

MANAGED FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK MANAGEMENT PROGRAM, STANDARD FOREIGN CURRENCY RATES ARE ASSIGNED TO EACH NIKE BRAND ENTITY IN OUR GEOGRAPHIC OPERATING SEGMENTS AND ARE USED TO RECORD ANY NON-FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY REVENUES OR PRODUCT PURCHASES INTO THE

ENTITYS FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY. GEOGRAPHIC OPERATING SEGMENT REVENUES AND COST OF SALES REFLECT USE OF THESE STANDARD RATES. FOR ALL NIKE BRAND OPERATING SEGMENTS, DIFFERENCES BETWEEN ASSIGNED STANDARD FOREIGN CURRENCY RATES AND ACTUAL MARKET

RATES ARE INCLUDED IN CORPORATE TOGETHER WITH FOREIGN CURRENCY HEDGE GAINS AND LOSSES GENERATED FROM THE CENTRALLY MANAGED FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK MANAGEMENT PROGRAM AND OTHER CONVERSION GAINS AND LOSSES. PRIOR TO JUNE 1, 2010, FOREIGN CURRENCY

RESULTS, INCLUDING HEDGE RESULTS AND OTHER CONVERSION GAINS AND LOSSES GENERATED BY THE WESTERN EUROPE AND CENTRAL & EASTERN EUROPE GEOGRAPHIES WERE RECORDED IN THEIR RESPECTIVE GEOGRAPHIC RESULTS.

ADDITIONS TO LONG-LIVED ASSETS AS PRESENTED IN THE FOLLOWING TABLE REPRESENT CAPITAL EXPENDITURES.

ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, INVENTORIES AND PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT FOR OPERATING SEGMENTS ARE REGULARLY REVIEWED BY MANAGEMENT AND ARE

THEREFORE PROVIDED BELOW.

CERTAIN PRIOR YEAR AMOUNTS HAVE BEEN RECLASSIFIED TO CONFORM TO FISCAL 2011 PRESENTATION, AS SOUTH

AFRICA BECAME PART OF THE EMERGING MARKETS OPERATING SEGMENT BEGINNING JUNE 1, 2010. PREVIOUSLY, SOUTH AFRICA WAS PART OF THE CENTRAL & EASTERN EUROPE OPERATING SEGMENT.
