SALES AND MARKETING

FINANCIAL INFORMATION ABOUT GEOGRAPHIC AND SEGMENT OPERATIONS APPEARS IN NOTE 17 OF THE

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ON PAGE 68.

WE EXPERIENCE MODERATE FLUCTUATIONS IN AGGREGATE SALES VOLUME DURING THE YEAR. HISTORICALLY,

REVENUES IN THE FIRST AND FOURTH FISCAL QUARTERS HAVE SLIGHTLY EXCEEDED THOSE IN THE SECOND AND THIRD QUARTERS. HOWEVER, THE MIX OF PRODUCT SALES MAY VARY CONSIDERABLY FROM TIME TO TIME AS A RESULT OF CHANGES IN SEASONAL AND GEOGRAPHIC DEMAND FOR

PARTICULAR TYPES OF FOOTWEAR, APPAREL AND EQUIPMENT.

BECAUSE NIKE IS A CONSUMER PRODUCTS COMPANY, THE RELATIVE POPULARITY OF VARIOUS

SPORTS AND FITNESS ACTIVITIES AND CHANGING DESIGN TRENDS AFFECT THE DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS. WE MUST THEREFORE RESPOND TO TRENDS AND SHIFTS IN CONSUMER PREFERENCES BY ADJUSTING THE MIX OF EXISTING PRODUCT OFFERINGS, DEVELOPING NEW PRODUCTS, STYLES

AND CATEGORIES, AND INFLUENCING SPORTS AND FITNESS PREFERENCES THROUGH AGGRESSIVE MARKETING. THIS IS A CONTINUING RISK. FAILURE TO RESPOND IN A TIMELY AND ADEQUATE MANNER COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR SALES AND PROFITABILITY.

UNITED STATES MARKET

IN FISCAL 2006, SALES IN THE UNITED STATES (INCLUDING U.S. SALES OF COLE HAAN, CONVERSE,

EXETER BRANDS GROUP, HURLEY, NIKE BAUER HOCKEY AND NIKE GOLF) ACCOUNTED FOR APPROXIMATELY 47 PERCENT OF TOTAL REVENUES, COMPARED TO 46 PERCENT IN FISCAL 2005 AND 47 PERCENT IN FISCAL 2004. WE SELL TO APPROXIMATELY 24,000 RETAIL ACCOUNTS IN THE

UNITED STATES. THE NIKE BRAND DOMESTIC RETAIL ACCOUNT BASE INCLUDES A MIX OF FOOTWEAR STORES, SPORTING GOODS STORES, ATHLETIC SPECIALTY STORES, DEPARTMENT STORES, SKATE, TENNIS AND GOLF SHOPS, AND OTHER RETAIL ACCOUNTS. DURING FISCAL YEAR 2006, OUR

THREE LARGEST CUSTOMERS ACCOUNTED FOR APPROXIMATELY 30 PERCENT OF NIKE BRAND SALES IN THE UNITED STATES EXCLUDING SALES FROM NIKE BAUER HOCKEY AND NIKE GOLF, AND 25 PERCENT OF TOTAL SALES IN THE UNITED STATES.

WE MAKE SUBSTANTIAL USE OF OUR FUTURES ORDERING PROGRAM, WHICH ALLOWS RETAILERS TO ORDER FIVE TO SIX MONTHS IN ADVANCE OF DELIVERY WITH THE

COMMITMENT THAT 90 PERCENT OF THEIR ORDERS WILL BE DELIVERED WITHIN A SET TIME PERIOD AT A FIXED PRICE. IN FISCAL YEAR 2006, 90 PERCENT OF OUR U.S. WHOLESALE FOOTWEAR SHIPMENTS (EXCLUDING COLE HAAN, CONVERSE, EXETER BRANDS GROUP, HURLEY, NIKE BAUER

HOCKEY AND NIKE GOLF) WERE MADE UNDER THE FUTURES PROGRAM, COMPARED TO 91 PERCENT IN FISCAL 2005 AND 90 PERCENT IN FISCAL 2004. IN FISCAL 2006, 69 PERCENT OF OUR U.S. WHOLESALE APPAREL SHIPMENTS (EXCLUDING U.S. LICENSED TEAM APPAREL, COLE HAAN,

CONVERSE, EXETER BRANDS GROUP, HURLEY, NIKE BAUER HOCKEY AND NIKE GOLF) WERE MADE UNDER THE FUTURES PROGRAM, COMPARED TO 71 PERCENT IN FISCAL 2005, AND 67 PERCENT IN FISCAL 2004.

REVENUES IN FISCAL 2006, COMPARED TO 54 PERCENT IN FISCAL 2005 AND 53 PERCENT IN FISCAL 2004. WE ESTIMATE THAT WE SELL TO MORE THAN 27,000 RETAIL ACCOUNTS OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES, EXCLUDING SALES BY INDEPENDENT DISTRIBUTORS AND LICENSEES. WE

OPERATE 21 DISTRIBUTION CENTERS IN EUROPE, ASIA, AUSTRALIA, AFRICA AND CANADA. IN MANY COUNTRIES AND REGIONS, INCLUDING CANADA, ASIA, SOME LATIN AMERICAN COUNTRIES, AND EUROPE, WE HAVE A FUTURES ORDERING PROGRAM FOR RETAILERS SIMILAR TO THE UNITED

SIGNIFICANT CUSTOMER

FOOT LOCKER INC., WHICH OPERATES A CHAIN OF RETAIL STORES SPECIALIZING IN ATHLETIC

FOOTWEAR AND APPAREL, ACCOUNTED FOR APPROXIMATELY 10 PERCENT OF GLOBAL NET SALES OF NIKE, INC. DURING FISCAL 2006. NO OTHER CUSTOMER ACCOUNTED FOR 10 PERCENT OR MORE OF OUR NET SALES DURING FISCAL 2006.

ORDERS

WORLDWIDE FUTURES AND ADVANCE ORDERS FOR NIKE BRAND ATHLETIC FOOTWEAR AND APPAREL, SCHEDULED FOR

DELIVERY FROM JUNE THROUGH NOVEMBER 2006, WERE $6.6 BILLION COMPARED TO $6.3 BILLION FOR THE SAME PERIOD LAST YEAR. THIS FUTURES AND ADVANCE ORDER AMOUNT IS CALCULATED BASED UPON OUR FORECAST OF THE ACTUAL EXCHANGE RATES UNDER WHICH OUR REVENUES

WILL BE TRANSLATED DURING THIS PERIOD, WHICH APPROXIMATE CURRENT SPOT RATES. BASED UPON HISTORICAL DATA, WE EXPECT THAT APPROXIMATELY 95 PERCENT OF THESE ORDERS WILL BE FILLED IN THAT TIME PERIOD, ALTHOUGH SOME ORDERS MAY BE CANCELLED. REPORTED

FUTURES AND ADVANCE ORDERS ARE NOT NECESSARILY INDICATIVE OF OUR EXPECTATION OF REVENUES FOR THIS PERIOD. THIS IS BECAUSE THE MIX OF ORDERS CAN SHIFT BETWEEN ADVANCE/FUTURES AND AT-ONCE ORDERS. IN ADDITION, FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE

FLUCTUATIONS AS WELL AS DIFFERING LEVELS OF ORDER CANCELLATIONS AND DISCOUNTS CAN CAUSE DIFFERENCES IN THE COMPARISONS BETWEEN FUTURES AND ADVANCE ORDERS AND ACTUAL REVENUES. MOREOVER, A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR REVENUE IS NOT DERIVED FROM FUTURES

AND ADVANCE ORDERS, INCLUDING AT-ONCE AND CLOSEOUT SALES OF NIKE FOOTWEAR AND APPAREL, WHOLESALE SALES OF EQUIPMENT, U.S. LICENSED TEAM APPAREL, COLE HAAN, CONVERSE, EXETER BRANDS GROUP, HURLEY, NIKE BAUER HOCKEY, NIKE GOLF, AND RETAIL SALES ACROSS

ALL BRANDS.

PRODUCT RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

WE BELIEVE THAT OUR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS ARE A KEY FACTOR IN OUR

PAST AND FUTURE SUCCESS. TECHNICAL INNOVATION IN THE DESIGN OF FOOTWEAR, APPAREL, AND ATHLETIC EQUIPMENT RECEIVE CONTINUED EMPHASIS AS NIKE STRIVES TO PRODUCE PRODUCTS THAT HELP TO REDUCE INJURY, ENHANCE ATHLETIC PERFORMANCE AND MAXIMIZE COMFORT.

IN ADDITION TO NIKES OWN STAFF OF SPECIALISTS IN THE AREAS OF BIOMECHANICS, EXERCISE PHYSIOLOGY, ENGINEERING, INDUSTRIAL DESIGN AND

RELATED FIELDS, WE ALSO UTILIZE RESEARCH COMMITTEES AND ADVISORY BOARDS MADE UP OF ATHLETES, COACHES, TRAINERS, EQUIPMENT MANAGERS, ORTHOPEDISTS, PODIATRISTS AND OTHER EXPERTS WHO CONSULT WITH US AND REVIEW DESIGNS, MATERIALS AND CONCEPTS FOR

PRODUCT IMPROVEMENT. EMPLOYEE ATHLETES AND OTHER ATHLETES WEAR-TEST AND EVALUATE PRODUCTS DURING THE DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT PROCESS.

MANUFACTURING

VIRTUALLY ALL OF OUR FOOTWEAR IS PRODUCED OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES. IN FISCAL 2006, CONTRACT

SUPPLIERS IN CHINA, VIETNAM, INDONESIA AND THAILAND MANUFACTURED 35 PERCENT, 29 PERCENT, 21 PERCENT AND 13 PERCENT OF TOTAL NIKE BRAND FOOTWEAR, RESPECTIVELY. WE ALSO HAVE MANUFACTURING AGREEMENTS WITH INDEPENDENT FACTORIES IN ARGENTINA, BRAZIL,

INDIA, ITALY, AND SOUTH AFRICA TO MANUFACTURE FOOTWEAR FOR SALE PRIMARILY WITHIN THOSE COUNTRIES. OUR LARGEST SINGLE FOOTWEAR FACTORY ACCOUNTED FOR APPROXIMATELY 6 PERCENT OF TOTAL FISCAL 2006 FOOTWEAR PRODUCTION.

ALMOST ALL OF NIKE BRAND APPAREL PRODUCTION FOR SALE TO THE UNITED STATES MARKET, AND ALL OF OUR APPAREL PRODUCTION FOR SALE TO THE INTERNATIONAL MARKET,

WAS MANUFACTURED OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES BY INDEPENDENT CONTRACT MANUFACTURERS LOCATED IN 40 COUNTRIES. MOST OF THIS APPAREL PRODUCTION OCCURRED IN BANGLADESH, CHINA, HONDURAS, INDIA, INDONESIA, MALAYSIA, MEXICO, PAKISTAN, SRI LANKA, TAIWAN,

THAILAND, TURKEY AND VIETNAM. OUR LARGEST SINGLE APPAREL FACTORY ACCOUNTED FOR APPROXIMATELY 5 PERCENT OF TOTAL FISCAL 2006 APPAREL PRODUCTION.

THE PRINCIPAL MATERIALS USED IN OUR FOOTWEAR PRODUCTS ARE NATURAL AND SYNTHETIC RUBBER, PLASTIC COMPOUNDS, FOAM CUSHIONING MATERIALS, NYLON, LEATHER, CANVAS AND POLYURETHANE FILMS USED TO MAKE AIR-SOLE CUSHIONING COMPONENTS. NIKE IHM, INC.

AND NIKE (SUZHOU) SPORTS COMPANY, LTD., WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARIES OF NIKE, ARE OUR LARGEST SUPPLIERS OF THE AIR-SOLE CUSHIONING COMPONENTS USED IN FOOTWEAR. THE PRINCIPAL MATERIALS USED IN OUR APPAREL PRODUCTS ARE NATURAL AND SYNTHETIC FABRICS AND

THREADS, PLASTIC AND METAL HARDWARE, AND SPECIALIZED

TABLE OF CONTENTS

PERFORMANCE FABRICS DESIGNED TO REPEL RAIN, RETAIN HEAT, OR EFFICIENTLY TRANSPORT BODY MOISTURE. NIKE AND ITS CONTRACTORS AND SUPPLIERS BUY RAW MATERIALS IN

BULK. MOST RAW MATERIALS ARE AVAILABLE IN THE COUNTRIES WHERE MANUFACTURING TAKES PLACE. WE HAVE THUS FAR EXPERIENCED LITTLE DIFFICULTY IN SATISFYING OUR RAW MATERIAL REQUIREMENTS.

SINCE 1972, SOJITZ CORPORATION OF AMERICA (SOJITZ AMERICA) AND ITS PREDECESSOR, NISSHO IWAI AMERICAN CORPORATION, A SUBSIDIARY OF NISSHO IWAI

CORPORATION, A LARGE JAPANESE TRADING COMPANY, HAVE PERFORMED SIGNIFICANT IMPORT-EXPORT FINANCING SERVICES FOR US. DURING FISCAL 2006, SOJITZ AMERICA PROVIDED SUCH FINANCING SERVICES FOR MOST OF THE NIKE BRAND PRODUCTS SOLD OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED

STATES, EUROPE, MIDDLE EAST, AFRICA AND JAPAN, EXCLUDING PRODUCTS PRODUCED AND SOLD IN THE SAME COUNTRY. HOWEVER, LESS THAN 13 PERCENT OF NIKE BRAND PRODUCTS, EXCLUDING PRODUCTS PRODUCED AND SOLD IN THE SAME COUNTRY, WERE SOLD OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED

STATES, EUROPE, MIDDLE EAST, AFRICA AND JAPAN IN FISCAL 2006. ANY FAILURE OF SOJITZ AMERICA TO PROVIDE THESE SERVICES OR ANY FAILURE OF SOJITZ AMERICAS BANKS COULD DISRUPT OUR ABILITY TO ACQUIRE PRODUCTS FROM OUR SUPPLIERS AND TO DELIVER

PRODUCTS TO OUR CUSTOMERS OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES, EUROPE, MIDDLE EAST, AFRICA AND JAPAN. SUCH A DISRUPTION COULD RESULT IN CANCELLED ORDERS THAT WOULD ADVERSELY AFFECT SALES AND PROFITABILITY. HOWEVER, WE BELIEVE THAT ANY SUCH DISRUPTION WOULD

BE SHORT TERM IN DURATION DUE TO THE READY AVAILABILITY OF ALTERNATIVE SOURCES OF FINANCING AT COMPETITIVE RATES. OUR CURRENT AGREEMENTS WITH SOJITZ AMERICA EXPIRE ON MAY 31, 2008.

INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS AND TRADE

OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS AND SOURCES OF SUPPLY ARE SUBJECT TO THE USUAL

RISKS OF DOING BUSINESS ABROAD, SUCH AS POSSIBLE REVALUATION OF CURRENCIES, EXPORT DUTIES, ANTI-DUMPING DUTIES, QUOTAS, SAFEGUARD MEASURES, TRADE RESTRICTIONS, RESTRICTIONS ON THE TRANSFER OF FUNDS AND, IN CERTAIN PARTS OF THE WORLD, POLITICAL

INSTABILITY AND TERRORISM. WE HAVE NOT, TO DATE, BEEN MATERIALLY AFFECTED BY ANY SUCH RISK, BUT CANNOT PREDICT THE LIKELIHOOD OF SUCH DEVELOPMENTS OCCURRING. WE BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO DEVELOP, OVER A PERIOD OF TIME, ADEQUATE ALTERNATIVE

SOURCES OF SUPPLY FOR THE PRODUCTS OBTAINED FROM OUR PRESENT SUPPLIERS OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES. IF EVENTS PREVENTED US FROM ACQUIRING PRODUCTS FROM OUR SUPPLIERS IN A PARTICULAR COUNTRY, OUR OPERATIONS COULD BE TEMPORARILY DISRUPTED AND WE

COULD EXPERIENCE AN ADVERSE FINANCIAL IMPACT. HOWEVER, WE BELIEVE THAT WE COULD ABATE ANY SUCH DISRUPTION WITHIN A PERIOD OF NO MORE THAN 12 MONTHS, AND THAT MUCH OF THE ADVERSE IMPACT ON SUPPLY WOULD, THEREFORE, BE OF A SHORT-TERM NATURE. WE

BELIEVE THAT OUR PRINCIPAL COMPETITORS ARE SUBJECT TO SIMILAR RISKS.

AS A RESULT OF THE TRADE ACT OF 2003, THE UNITED STATES IMPLEMENTED

SIGNIFICANT NEW FEDERAL REQUIREMENTS FOR CARGO SECURITY, FOCUSED ON IMPORTS OF CONTAINERIZED CARGO. WE ARE A SIGNIFICANT IMPORTER OF CONTAINERIZED CARGO. ACCORDINGLY, WE PARTICIPATE ACTIVELY IN APPROPRIATE GOVERNMENTAL PROGRAMS, SUCH AS THE CUSTOMS

TRADE PARTNERSHIP AGAINST TERRORISM, TO REDUCE RISKS OF POSSIBLE SUPPLY DISRUPTIONS CAUSED BY U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL CARGO SECURITY MANDATES AND TERRORISM. ADDITIONALLY IN 2006, WE AND A BROAD COALITION OF BUSINESSES HAVE BEEN ACTIVELY WORKING WITH

THE UNITED STATES CONGRESS AS IT CONSIDERS LEGISLATION TO MAKE U.S. PORTS MORE SECURE. WE ARE ACTIVELY FOLLOWING THIS PROPOSED LEGISLATION AND BELIEVE THAT ANY LEGISLATION, IF PASSED, WILL NOT HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON OUR SUPPLY CHAIN. WE

BELIEVE THAT OUR MAJOR COMPETITORS STAND IN MUCH THE SAME POSITION OF RISK REGARDING THIS POTENTIAL LEGISLATION.

ALL OF OUR PRODUCTS

MANUFACTURED OVERSEAS AND IMPORTED INTO THE UNITED STATES, THE EUROPEAN UNION AND OTHER COUNTRIES ARE SUBJECT TO CUSTOMS DUTIES COLLECTED BY CUSTOMS AUTHORITIES. CUSTOMS INFORMATION SUBMITTED BY US IS ROUTINELY SUBJECT TO REVIEW BY CUSTOMS

AUTHORITIES. WE ARE UNABLE TO PREDICT WHETHER ADDITIONAL CUSTOMS DUTIES, ANTI-DUMPING DUTIES, QUOTAS, SAFEGUARD MEASURES, OR OTHER TRADE RESTRICTIONS MAY BE IMPOSED ON THE IMPORTATION OF OUR PRODUCTS IN THE FUTURE. SUCH ACTIONS COULD RESULT IN

INCREASES IN THE COST OF OUR PRODUCTS GENERALLY AND MIGHT ADVERSELY AFFECT THE SALES OR PROFITABILITY OF NIKE AND THE IMPORTED FOOTWEAR AND APPAREL INDUSTRY AS A WHOLE. ACCORDINGLY, WE ARE ACTIVELY MONITORING THE DEVELOPMENTS DESCRIBED BELOW.

FOOTWEAR IMPORTS INTO THE EUROPEAN UNION

FROM 1994 THROUGH JANUARY 1, 2005, THE EUROPEAN UNION (EU) IMPOSED LIMITS (OR QUOTAS) ON THE IMPORT OF CERTAIN TYPES OF FOOTWEAR MANUFACTURED IN CHINA. FOOTWEAR DESIGNED FOR USE IN

SPORTING ACTIVITIES, MEETING

6

TABLE OF CONTENTS

CERTAIN TECHNICAL CRITERIA AND HAVING A CIF (COST, INSURANCE AND FREIGHT) PRICE ABOVE NINE EUROS (SPECIAL TECHNOLOGY ATHLETIC FOOTWEAR OR

STAF), WAS EXCLUDED FROM THE QUOTAS. AS A RESULT OF THE STAF EXCLUSION, AND THE AMOUNT OF QUOTA MADE AVAILABLE TO US, THE QUOTAS DID NOT HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS. HOWEVER, AS PART OF CHINAS 2001 ACCESSION TO THE WORLD

TRADE ORGANIZATION (WTO), CHINA ENTERED INTO AN AGREEMENT WITH THE EU AND OTHER WTO MEMBERS TO ABIDE BY A SPECIAL SAFEGUARD ARRANGEMENT WHEREBY QUOTAS COULD BE IMPOSED ON ANY PRODUCT SOURCED IN CHINA, INCLUDING FOOTWEAR, IF THERE WAS A

SURGE IN IMPORTS FROM CHINA INTO ANOTHER WTO COUNTRY, AND AFTER A LEGAL PROCEEDING IT WAS DETERMINED THAT SUCH IMPORTS WERE INJURING A DOMESTIC PRODUCER. ADDITIONALLY, UNDER LONGSTANDING WTO RULES, ALL WTO MEMBER COUNTRIES RESERVED THE RIGHT TO

IMPOSE (1) SAFEGUARD MEASURES (TEMPORARY QUOTAS) IF IT CAN BE DEMONSTRATED IN A LEGAL PROCEEDING THAT INCREASED IMPORTS ARE INJURING ANOTHER WTO MEMBERS DOMESTIC INDUSTRY; AND (2) ANTI-DUMPING MEASURES IF IT CAN BE DEMONSTRATED IN A

LEGAL PROCEEDING THAT IMPORTS ARE BEING SOLD AT AN UNFAIR LOW PRICE IN ANOTHER WTO MEMBERS HOME MARKET, AND THOSE IMPORTS WERE CAUSING OR THREATENING TO CAUSE MATERIAL INJURY TO THE DOMESTIC INDUSTRY.

ACCORDINGLY, WITH THE PHASE-OUT OF THE QUOTAS AT THE BEGINNING OF 2005, AND THE EXPIRATION OF A SEPARATE EU ANTI-DUMPING CASE IN 2003 AGAINST FOOTWEAR

MADE IN CHINA, INDONESIA, AND THAILAND, THERE HAS BEEN RENEWED PRESSURE FROM SOME PARTS OF THE EU FOOTWEAR MANUFACTURING SECTOR TO RE-IMPOSE SOME LEVEL OF TRADE PROTECTION ON IMPORTED FOOTWEAR FROM CHINA, INDIA, VIETNAM, AND OTHER EXPORTING

COUNTRIES. IN JULY 2005, THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION, AT THE REQUEST OF THE EUROPEAN DOMESTIC FOOTWEAR INDUSTRY, INITIATED INVESTIGATIONS INTO LEATHER FOOTWEAR IMPORTED FROM CHINA AND VIETNAM. NIKE AND ALL OTHER MAJOR ATHLETIC FOOTWEAR MANUFACTURERS ARE

CURRENTLY PARTICIPATING ACTIVELY AS RESPONDENTS IN THIS INVESTIGATION AND ARE TAKING THE POSITION THAT ATHLETIC FOOTWEAR (I) SHOULD NOT BE WITHIN THE PRODUCT SCOPE OF THIS INVESTIGATION AND (II) DOES NOT MEET THE LEGAL REQUIREMENTS OF

INJURY AND PRICE IN AN ANTI-DUMPING INVESTIGATION. THE EU AGREED ON PROVISIONAL ANTI-DUMPING DUTIES IN MARCH 2006 BUT EXCLUDED STAF FROM THE MEASURES. WE ANTICIPATE THAT THE DEFINITIVE ANTI-DUMPING DUTIES WILL BE ADOPTED BY EARLY OCTOBER 2006 AND WE

EXPECT STAF TO BE EXCLUDED FROM THE FINAL MEASURES. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR MAJOR COMPETITORS STAND IN MUCH THE SAME POSITION REGARDING THESE POTENTIAL TRADE MEASURES.

VIETNAM IMPORTS INTO THE UNITED STATES

WE CURRENTLY SOURCE A PORTION OF OUR FOOTWEAR AND APPAREL

PRODUCTS FROM FACTORIES IN VIETNAM. IN 2001, THE UNITED STATES CONGRESS AND THE VIETNAMESE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY APPROVED A COMPREHENSIVE BILATERAL TRADE AGREEMENT, WHICH, AMONG OTHER THINGS, PROVIDES RECIPROCAL, NON-DISCRIMINATORY NORMAL TRADE

RELATIONS (NTR) BETWEEN THE U.S. AND VIETNAM. FOLLOWING THAT APPROVAL, THE U.S. GRANTED AN ANNUAL EXTENSION OF NTR TO VIETNAM. THE U.S. PRESIDENT MUST RENEW THIS GRANT ANNUALLY WITH THE OPPORTUNITY FOR REVIEW BY CONGRESS. IN JUNE 2006,

PRESIDENT BUSH RENEWED NTR FOR VIETNAM FOR AN ADDITIONAL YEAR AND WE ANTICIPATE CONGRESS WILL SUPPORT THIS DECISION, AS IT HAS DONE FOR THE PAST FIVE YEARS. ADDITIONALLY, IN THE SPRING OF 2006 VIETNAM FINISHED ITS WTO ACCESSION NEGOTIATIONS WITH

SEVERAL WTO COUNTRIES AND HAS EMBARKED ON ENTERING THE WTO AS A FULL MEMBER. LEGISLATION HAS BEEN INTRODUCED WITHIN CONGRESS TO PROVIDE VIETNAM PERMANENT NORMAL TRADE RELATIONS (PNTR) AND WE ANTICIPATE CONGRESSIONAL APPROVAL OF THIS

LEGISLATION IN 2006. VIETNAMS ENTRY INTO THE WTO AND THE U.S. PROVIDING VIETNAM PNTR WILL PROVIDE US GREATER CERTAINTY ABOUT OUR BUSINESS WITHIN VIETNAM. IT WILL LIKEWISE ENABLE US TO FURTHER EXPAND OUR PRODUCTION AND MARKETING OPPORTUNITIES

IN VIETNAM AND ALLOW FOR VIETNAMESE-SOURCED PRODUCTS TO CONTINUE TO ENTER THE UNITED STATES AT NTR TARIFF RATES.

COMPETITION

THE ATHLETIC FOOTWEAR, APPAREL AND EQUIPMENT INDUSTRY IS KEENLY COMPETITIVE IN THE UNITED STATES

AND ON A WORLDWIDE BASIS. WE COMPETE INTERNATIONALLY WITH AN INCREASING NUMBER OF ATHLETIC AND LEISURE SHOE COMPANIES, ATHLETIC AND LEISURE APPAREL COMPANIES, SPORTS EQUIPMENT COMPANIES, AND LARGE COMPANIES HAVING DIVERSIFIED LINES OF ATHLETIC AND

LEISURE SHOES, APPAREL AND EQUIPMENT, INCLUDING ADIDAS AND OTHERS. THE INTENSE COMPETITION AND THE RAPID CHANGES IN TECHNOLOGY AND CONSUMER PREFERENCES IN THE MARKETS FOR ATHLETIC AND LEISURE FOOTWEAR AND APPAREL, AND ATHLETIC EQUIPMENT, CONSTITUTE

SIGNIFICANT RISK FACTORS IN OUR OPERATIONS.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

NIKE IS THE LARGEST SELLER OF ATHLETIC FOOTWEAR AND ATHLETIC APPAREL IN THE WORLD. PERFORMANCE AND

RELIABILITY OF SHOES, APPAREL, AND EQUIPMENT, NEW PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT, PRICE, PRODUCT IDENTITY THROUGH MARKETING AND PROMOTION, AND CUSTOMER SUPPORT AND SERVICE ARE IMPORTANT ASPECTS OF COMPETITION IN THE ATHLETIC FOOTWEAR, APPAREL AND EQUIPMENT

INDUSTRY. TO HELP MARKET OUR PRODUCTS, WE CONTRACT WITH PROMINENT AND INFLUENTIAL ATHLETES, COACHES, TEAMS, COLLEGES AND SPORTS LEAGUES TO ENDORSE OUR BRANDS AND USE OUR PRODUCTS, AND WE ACTIVELY SPONSOR SPORTING EVENTS AND CLINICS. WE BELIEVE THAT

WE ARE COMPETITIVE IN ALL OF THESE AREAS.

TRADEMARKS AND PATENTS

WE UTILIZE TRADEMARKS ON NEARLY ALL OF OUR PRODUCTS AND BELIEVE THAT HAVING DISTINCTIVE

MARKS THAT ARE READILY IDENTIFIABLE IS AN IMPORTANT FACTOR IN CREATING A MARKET FOR OUR GOODS, IN IDENTIFYING THE COMPANY, AND IN DISTINGUISHING OUR GOODS FROM THE GOODS OF OTHERS. WE CONSIDER OUR NIKE

®

AND SWOOSH DESIGN

®

TRADEMARKS TO BE AMONG OUR MOST VALUABLE ASSETS AND WE HAVE REGISTERED THESE TRADEMARKS IN OVER 100 COUNTRIES. IN

ADDITION, WE OWN MANY OTHER TRADEMARKS THAT WE UTILIZE IN MARKETING OUR PRODUCTS. WE CONTINUE TO VIGOROUSLY PROTECT OUR TRADEMARKS AGAINST INFRINGEMENT.

NIKE HAS AN EXCLUSIVE, WORLDWIDE LICENSE TO MAKE AND SELL FOOTWEAR USING PATENTED AIR TECHNOLOGY. THE PROCESS UTILIZES PRESSURIZED GAS ENCAPSULATED IN POLYURETHANE. SOME OF THE EARLY NIKE AIR

®

PATENTS HAVE EXPIRED, WHICH MAY ENABLE COMPETITORS TO

USE CERTAIN TYPES OF SIMILAR TECHNOLOGY. SUBSEQUENT NIKE AIR

®

PATENTS WILL NOT EXPIRE FOR SEVERAL YEARS. WE ALSO HAVE HUNDREDS OF U.S. AND FOREIGN PATENTS COVERING COMPONENTS, FEATURES, AND DESIGNS USED IN VARIOUS ATHLETIC AND LEISURE SHOES, APPAREL AND EQUIPMENT. THESE PATENTS

EXPIRE AT VARIOUS TIMES, AND HAVE A REMAINING DURATION OF FROM NOW TO AT LEAST 2026, ALTHOUGH THE DURATION OF PATENTS VARIES BY COUNTRY. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR SUCCESS DEPENDS PRIMARILY UPON SKILLS IN DESIGN, RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, PRODUCTION AND

MARKETING RATHER THAN UPON OUR PATENT POSITION. HOWEVER, WE HAVE FOLLOWED A POLICY OF FILING APPLICATIONS FOR UNITED STATES AND FOREIGN PATENTS ON INVENTIONS, DESIGNS AND IMPROVEMENTS THAT WE DEEM VALUABLE.

EMPLOYEES

WE HAD APPROXIMATELY 28,000 EMPLOYEES AT MAY 31, 2006. MANAGEMENT CONSIDERS ITS RELATIONSHIP

WITH EMPLOYEES TO BE EXCELLENT. NONE OF OUR EMPLOYEES IS REPRESENTED BY A UNION, WITH THE EXCEPTION OF NIKE BAUER HOCKEY INC. OF NIKE BAUER HOCKEYS EMPLOYEES, APPROXIMATELY 37 PERCENT, OR APPROXIMATELY 183, ARE COVERED BY THREE UNION

COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENTS WITH THREE SEPARATE BARGAINING UNITS. THE COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENTS EXPIRE ON VARIOUS DATES FROM 2007 THROUGH 2008. THERE HAS NEVER BEEN A MATERIAL INTERRUPTION OF OPERATIONS DUE TO LABOR DISAGREEMENTS.

CONSUMERS AND ENDORSERS; DEMOGRAPHIC CHANGES; CHANGES IN CONSUMER PREFERENCES; POPULARITY OF PARTICULAR DESIGNS, CATEGORIES OF PRODUCTS, AND SPORTS; SEASONAL AND GEOGRAPHIC DEMAND FOR NIKE PRODUCTS; DIFFICULTIES IN ANTICIPATING OR FORECASTING

CHANGES IN CONSUMER PREFERENCES, CONSUMER DEMAND FOR NIKE PRODUCTS, AND THE VARIOUS MARKET FACTORS DESCRIBED ABOVE; DIFFICULTIES IN IMPLEMENTING, OPERATING, AND MAINTAINING NIKES INCREASINGLY COMPLEX INFORMATION SYSTEMS AND CONTROLS,

INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE SYSTEMS RELATED TO DEMAND AND SUPPLY PLANNING, AND INVENTORY CONTROL; INTERRUPTIONS IN DATA AND COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEMS; FLUCTUATIONS AND DIFFICULTY IN FORECASTING OPERATING RESULTS, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,

THE FACT THAT ADVANCE FUTURES ORDERS MAY NOT BE INDICATIVE OF FUTURE REVENUES DUE TO THE CHANGING MIX OF FUTURES AND AT-ONCE ORDERS, CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE FLUCTUATIONS, ORDER CANCELLATIONS, AND THE FACT THAT A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR

REVENUE IS NOT DERIVED FROM FUTURES ORDERS; THE ABILITY OF NIKE TO SUSTAIN, MANAGE OR FORECAST ITS GROWTH AND INVENTORIES; THE SIZE, TIMING AND MIX OF PURCHASES OF NIKES PRODUCTS; NEW PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT AND INTRODUCTION; THE ABILITY TO SECURE

AND PROTECT TRADEMARKS, PATENTS, AND OTHER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY; PERFORMANCE AND RELIABILITY OF PRODUCTS; CUSTOMER SERVICE; ADVERSE PUBLICITY; THE LOSS OF SIGNIFICANT CUSTOMERS OR SUPPLIERS; DEPENDENCE ON DISTRIBUTORS; BUSINESS DISRUPTIONS;

RETAIN QUALIFIED PERSONNEL; AND OTHER FACTORS REFERENCED OR INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE IN THIS REPORT AND OTHER REPORTS.

THE RISKS INCLUDED

HERE ARE NOT EXHAUSTIVE. OTHER SECTIONS OF THIS REPORT MAY INCLUDE ADDITIONAL FACTORS WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT NIKES BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE. MOREOVER, NIKE OPERATES IN A VERY COMPETITIVE AND RAPIDLY CHANGING ENVIRONMENT. NEW

RISK FACTORS EMERGE FROM TIME TO TIME AND IT IS NOT POSSIBLE FOR MANAGEMENT TO PREDICT ALL SUCH RISK FACTORS, NOR CAN IT ASSESS THE IMPACT OF ALL SUCH RISK FACTORS ON NIKES BUSINESS OR THE EXTENT TO WHICH ANY FACTOR, OR COMBINATION OF FACTORS,

MAY CAUSE ACTUAL RESULTS TO DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THOSE CONTAINED IN ANY FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS. GIVEN THESE RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES, INVESTORS SHOULD NOT PLACE UNDUE RELIANCE ON FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS AS A PREDICTION OF ACTUAL RESULTS.

OUR PRODUCTS FACE INTENSE COMPETITION.

NIKE IS A CONSUMER PRODUCTS COMPANY AND THE RELATIVE POPULARITY OF VARIOUS SPORTS AND FITNESS ACTIVITIES AND CHANGING DESIGN TRENDS AFFECT THE DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS. THE ATHLETIC FOOTWEAR, APPAREL AND EQUIPMENT INDUSTRY IS KEENLY

COMPETITIVE IN THE UNITED STATES AND ON A WORLDWIDE BASIS. WE COMPETE INTERNATIONALLY WITH AN INCREASING NUMBER OF ATHLETIC AND LEISURE SHOE COMPANIES, ATHLETIC AND LEISURE APPAREL COMPANIES, SPORTS EQUIPMENT COMPANIES, AND LARGE COMPANIES HAVING

DIVERSIFIED LINES OF ATHLETIC AND LEISURE SHOES, APPAREL AND EQUIPMENT. WE ALSO COMPETE WITH OTHER COMPANIES FOR THE PRODUCTION CAPACITY OF INDEPENDENT MANUFACTURERS THAT PRODUCE OUR PRODUCTS AND FOR IMPORT QUOTA CAPACITY.

OUR COMPETITORS PRODUCT OFFERINGS, TECHNOLOGIES, MARKETING EXPENDITURES (INCLUDING FOR ADVERTISING AND ENDORSEMENTS), PRICING, COSTS OF PRODUCTION,

AND CUSTOMER SERVICE ARE AREAS OF INTENSE COMPETITION. THIS, PLUS RAPID CHANGES IN TECHNOLOGY AND CONSUMER PREFERENCES IN THE MARKETS FOR ATHLETIC AND LEISURE FOOTWEAR AND APPAREL, AND ATHLETIC EQUIPMENT, CONSTITUTE SIGNIFICANT RISK FACTORS IN OUR

OPERATIONS. IF WE DO NOT ADEQUATELY AND TIMELY ANTICIPATE AND RESPOND TO OUR COMPETITORS, OUR COSTS MAY INCREASE OR THE CONSUMER DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS MAY DECLINE SIGNIFICANTLY.

IF WE ARE UNABLE TO ANTICIPATE CONSUMER PREFERENCES AND DEVELOP NEW PRODUCTS, WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO MAINTAIN OR INCREASE OUR NET REVENUES AND PROFITABILITY.

OUR SUCCESS DEPENDS ON OUR ABILITY TO IDENTIFY, ORIGINATE AND DEFINE PRODUCT TRENDS AS WELL AS TO ANTICIPATE, GAUGE AND REACT TO CHANGING CONSUMER DEMANDS

IN A TIMELY MANNER. ALL OF OUR PRODUCTS ARE SUBJECT TO CHANGING

11

TABLE OF CONTENTS

CONSUMER PREFERENCES THAT CANNOT BE PREDICTED WITH CERTAINTY. OUR NEW PRODUCTS MAY NOT RECEIVE CONSUMER ACCEPTANCE AS CONSUMER PREFERENCES COULD SHIFT

RAPIDLY TO DIFFERENT TYPES OF PERFORMANCE OR OTHER SPORTS APPAREL OR AWAY FROM THESE TYPES OF PRODUCTS ALTOGETHER, AND OUR FUTURE SUCCESS DEPENDS IN PART ON OUR ABILITY TO ANTICIPATE AND RESPOND TO THESE CHANGES. IF WE FAIL TO ANTICIPATE ACCURATELY

AND RESPOND TO TRENDS AND SHIFTS IN CONSUMER PREFERENCES BY ADJUSTING THE MIX OF EXISTING PRODUCT OFFERINGS, DEVELOPING NEW PRODUCTS, DESIGNS, STYLES AND CATEGORIES, AND INFLUENCING SPORTS AND FITNESS PREFERENCES THROUGH AGGRESSIVE MARKETING, WE

COULD EXPERIENCE LOWER SALES, EXCESS INVENTORIES AND LOWER PROFIT MARGINS, ANY OF WHICH COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

WE RELY ON TECHNICAL INNOVATION TO COMPETE IN THE MARKET FOR OUR PRODUCTS.

ALTHOUGH DESIGN

AND AESTHETICS OF OUR PRODUCTS APPEAR TO BE THE MOST IMPORTANT FACTOR FOR CONSUMER ACCEPTANCE OF OUR PRODUCTS, TECHNICAL INNOVATION IN THE DESIGN OF FOOTWEAR, APPAREL, AND ATHLETIC EQUIPMENT IS ALSO ESSENTIAL TO THE COMMERCIAL SUCCESS OF OUR

PRODUCTS. RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT PLAYS A KEY ROLE IN TECHNICAL INNOVATION. WE RELY UPON SPECIALISTS IN THE FIELDS OF BIOMECHANICS, EXERCISE PHYSIOLOGY, ENGINEERING, INDUSTRIAL DESIGN AND RELATED FIELDS, AS WELL AS RESEARCH COMMITTEES AND ADVISORY

BOARDS MADE UP OF ATHLETES, COACHES, TRAINERS, EQUIPMENT MANAGERS, ORTHOPEDISTS, PODIATRISTS AND OTHER EXPERTS TO DEVELOP CUTTING EDGE PERFORMANCE PRODUCTS. WHILE WE STRIVE TO PRODUCE PRODUCTS THAT HELP TO REDUCE INJURY, ENHANCE ATHLETIC PERFORMANCE

AND MAXIMIZE COMFORT, FAILURE TO INTRODUCE TECHNICAL INNOVATION IN OUR PRODUCTS COULD RESULT IN A DECLINE IN CONSUMER DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS.

FAILURE TO CONTINUE TO OBTAIN HIGH QUALITY ENDORSERS OF OUR PRODUCTS COULD HARM OUR BUSINESS.

WE ESTABLISH

RELATIONSHIPS WITH PROFESSIONAL ATHLETES AND SPORTS TEAMS AND LEAGUES TO EVALUATE AND PROMOTE OUR PRODUCTS, AND ESTABLISH THE AUTHENTICITY OF OUR PRODUCTS WITH CONSUMERS. IF CERTAIN OF OUR ENDORSERS WERE TO STOP USING OUR PRODUCTS CONTRARY TO THEIR

ENDORSEMENT AGREEMENTS, OUR BUSINESS COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED. IN ADDITION, ACTIONS TAKEN BY ATHLETES, TEAMS OR LEAGUES ASSOCIATED WITH OUR PRODUCTS THAT HARM THE REPUTATIONS OF THOSE ATHLETES, TEAMS OR LEAGUES COULD ALSO HARM OUR BRAND IMAGE

WITH CONSUMERS AND, AS A RESULT, COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR SALES AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. IN ADDITION, POOR PERFORMANCE BY OUR ENDORSERS, A FAILURE TO CONTINUE TO CORRECTLY IDENTIFY PROMISING ATHLETES TO USE AND ENDORSE OUR PRODUCTS, OR A

FAILURE TO ENTER INTO ENDORSEMENT ARRANGEMENTS WITH PROMINENT ATHLETES AND SPORTS ORGANIZATIONS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BRAND AND RESULT IN DECREASED SALES OF OUR PRODUCTS.

FAILURE OF OUR CONTRACTORS TO COMPLY WITH OUR CODE OF CONDUCT, LOCAL LAWS, AND OTHER STANDARDS COULD HARM OUR BUSINESS.

WE CONTRACT WITH HUNDREDS OF CONTRACTORS OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES TO MANUFACTURE NIKE BRAND PRODUCTS, AND WE IMPOSE ON THOSE CONTRACTORS A CODE OF CONDUCT AND OTHER ENVIRONMENTAL, HEALTH, AND SAFETY STANDARDS FOR

THE BENEFIT OF WORKERS. HOWEVER, FROM TIME TO TIME CONTRACTORS MAY NOT BE IN COMPLIANCE WITH SUCH STANDARDS OR APPLICABLE LOCAL LAW. SIGNIFICANT OR CONTINUING NONCOMPLIANCE WITH SUCH STANDARDS AND LAWS BY ONE OR MORE CONTRACTORS COULD HARM OUR

REPUTATION AND, AS A RESULT, COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR SALES AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

OUR BUSINESS IS AFFECTED BY SEASONALITY, WHICH COULD

RESULT IN FLUCTUATIONS IN OUR OPERATING RESULTS AND STOCK PRICE.

WE EXPERIENCE MODERATE FLUCTUATIONS IN AGGREGATE SALES VOLUME

DURING THE YEAR. HISTORICALLY, REVENUES IN THE FIRST AND FOURTH FISCAL QUARTERS HAVE SLIGHTLY EXCEEDED THOSE IN THE SECOND AND THIRD FISCAL QUARTERS. HOWEVER, THE MIX OF PRODUCT SALES MAY VARY CONSIDERABLY FROM TIME TO TIME AS A RESULT OF CHANGES IN

SEASONAL AND GEOGRAPHIC DEMAND FOR PARTICULAR TYPES OF FOOTWEAR, APPAREL AND EQUIPMENT. IN ADDITION, OUR CUSTOMERS MAY CANCEL ORDERS, CHANGE DELIVERY SCHEDULES OR CHANGE THE MIX OF PRODUCTS ORDERED WITH MINIMAL NOTICE. AS A RESULT, WE MAY NOT BE

ABLE TO ACCURATELY PREDICT OUR QUARTERLY SALES. ACCORDINGLY, OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS ARE LIKELY TO FLUCTUATE SIGNIFICANTLY FROM PERIOD TO PERIOD. THIS SEASONALITY, ALONG WITH OTHER FACTORS THAT ARE BEYOND OUR

12

TABLE OF CONTENTS

CONTROL, INCLUDING GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, CHANGES IN CONSUMER PREFERENCES, WEATHER CONDITIONS, AVAILABILITY OF IMPORT QUOTAS AND CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE

FLUCTUATIONS, COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS AND CAUSE OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS TO FLUCTUATE. OUR OPERATING MARGINS ARE ALSO SENSITIVE TO A NUMBER OF FACTORS THAT ARE BEYOND OUR CONTROL, INCLUDING SHIFTS IN PRODUCT SALES MIX, GEOGRAPHIC SALES

TRENDS, AND CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE FLUCTUATIONS, ALL OF WHICH WE EXPECT TO CONTINUE. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN ANY PERIOD SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED INDICATIVE OF THE RESULTS TO BE EXPECTED FOR ANY FUTURE PERIOD.

FUTURES ORDERS MAY NOT BE AN ACCURATE INDICATION OF OUR FUTURE REVENUES.

WE MAKE SUBSTANTIAL USE OF OUR FUTURES ORDERING PROGRAM, WHICH ALLOWS RETAILERS TO ORDER FIVE TO SIX MONTHS IN ADVANCE OF DELIVERY WITH THE

COMMITMENT THAT 90 PERCENT OF THEIR ORDERS WILL BE DELIVERED WITHIN A SET PERIOD AT A FIXED PRICE. OUR FUTURES ORDERING PROGRAM ALLOWS US TO MINIMIZE THE AMOUNT OF PRODUCTS WE HOLD IN INVENTORY, PURCHASING COSTS, THE TIME NECESSARY TO FILL CUSTOMER

ORDERS, AND THE RISK OF NON-DELIVERY. WE REPORT CHANGES IN FUTURES ORDERS IN OUR PERIODIC FINANCIAL REPORTS. REPORTED FUTURES ORDERS ARE NOT NECESSARILY INDICATIVE OF OUR EXPECTATION OF CHANGES IN REVENUES FOR ANY FUTURE PERIOD. THIS IS BECAUSE THE

MIX OF ORDERS CAN SHIFT BETWEEN ADVANCE/FUTURES AND AT-ONCE ORDERS. IN ADDITION, FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE FLUCTUATIONS AND ORDER CANCELLATIONS CAN CAUSE DIFFERENCES IN THE COMPARISONS BETWEEN FUTURES ORDERS AND ACTUAL REVENUES. MOREOVER, A

SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR REVENUE IS NOT DERIVED FROM FUTURES ORDERS, INCLUDING WHOLESALE SALES OF EQUIPMENT, U.S. LICENSED TEAM APPAREL, COLE HAAN, CONVERSE, EXETER BRANDS GROUP, HURLEY, NIKE BAUER HOCKEY, NIKE GOLF, AND RETAIL SALES ACROSS ALL

BRANDS.

OUR FUTURES ORDERING PROGRAM DOES NOT PREVENT EXCESS INVENTORIES OR INVENTORY SHORTAGES, WHICH COULD RESULT IN DECREASED

OPERATING MARGINS AND HARM TO OUR BUSINESS.

WE PURCHASE PRODUCTS FROM MANUFACTURERS OUTSIDE OF OUR FUTURES ORDERING PROGRAM AND IN

ADVANCE OF CUSTOMER ORDERS, WHICH WE HOLD IN INVENTORY AND RE-SELL TO CUSTOMERS. THERE IS A RISK THAT WE MAY BE UNABLE TO SELL EXCESS PRODUCTS THAT WE HAVE ORDERED FROM MANUFACTURERS. INVENTORY LEVELS IN EXCESS OF CUSTOMER DEMAND MAY RESULT IN

INVENTORY WRITE-DOWNS, AND THE SALE OF EXCESS INVENTORY AT DISCOUNTED PRICES COULD SIGNIFICANTLY IMPAIR OUR BRAND IMAGE AND HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR OPERATING RESULTS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. CONVERSELY, IF WE UNDERESTIMATE CONSUMER DEMAND FOR

OUR PRODUCTS OR IF OUR MANUFACTURERS FAIL TO SUPPLY THE PRODUCTS THAT WE REQUIRE AT THE TIME WE NEED THEM, WE MAY EXPERIENCE INVENTORY SHORTAGES. INVENTORY SHORTAGES MIGHT DELAY SHIPMENTS TO CUSTOMERS, NEGATIVELY IMPACT RETAILER AND DISTRIBUTOR

RELATIONSHIPS, AND DIMINISH BRAND LOYALTY.

THE DIFFICULTY IN FORECASTING DEMAND ALSO MAKES IT DIFFICULT TO ESTIMATE OUR FUTURE RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION FROM PERIOD TO PERIOD. A FAILURE TO ACCURATELY PREDICT THE LEVEL OF DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR NET REVENUES AND NET INCOME, AND WE ARE UNLIKELY TO FORECAST SUCH EFFECTS WITH ANY CERTAINTY IN

ADVANCE.

WE MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY THE FINANCIAL HEALTH OF OUR RETAILERS.

WE EXTEND CREDIT TO OUR CUSTOMERS BASED ON AN ASSESSMENT OF A CUSTOMERS FINANCIAL CIRCUMSTANCES, GENERALLY WITHOUT REQUIRING COLLATERAL. TO ASSIST

IN THE SCHEDULING OF PRODUCTION AND THE SHIPPING OF SEASONAL PRODUCTS, WE OFFER CUSTOMERS THE ABILITY TO PLACE ORDERS FIVE TO SIX MONTHS AHEAD OF DELIVERY UNDER OUR FUTURES ORDERING PROGRAM. THESE ADVANCE ORDERS MAY BE CANCELLED, AND THE

RISK OF CANCELLATION MAY INCREASE WHEN DEALING WITH FINANCIALLY AILING RETAILERS OR RETAILERS STRUGGLING WITH ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTY. IN THE PAST, SOME CUSTOMERS HAVE EXPERIENCED FINANCIAL DIFFICULTIES, WHICH IN TURN HAVE HAD AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR

BUSINESS. FROM TIME TO TIME RETAILERS WILL BE MORE CAUTIOUS THAN USUAL WITH ORDERS AS A RESULT OF WEAKNESS IN THE RETAIL ECONOMY. A SLOWING ECONOMY IN OUR KEY MARKETS COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE FINANCIAL HEALTH OF OUR CUSTOMERS, WHICH COULD

IN TURN HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

FAILURE TO ADEQUATELY PROTECT OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS

COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS.

WE UTILIZE TRADEMARKS ON NEARLY ALL OF OUR PRODUCTS AND BELIEVE THAT HAVING DISTINCTIVE MARKS

THAT ARE READILY IDENTIFIABLE IS AN IMPORTANT FACTOR IN CREATING A MARKET FOR OUR GOODS, IN IDENTIFYING US, AND IN DISTINGUISHING OUR

13

TABLE OF CONTENTS

GOODS FROM THE GOODS OF OTHERS. WE CONSIDER OUR NIKE

®

AND SWOOSH DESIGN

®

TRADEMARKS TO BE AMONG OUR MOST VALUABLE ASSETS AND WE HAVE REGISTERED THESE TRADEMARKS IN OVER 100 COUNTRIES. IN ADDITION, WE OWN MANY OTHER TRADEMARKS THAT WE UTILIZE IN MARKETING OUR PRODUCTS. WE

BELIEVE THAT OUR TRADEMARKS, PATENTS, AND OTHER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS ARE IMPORTANT TO OUR BRAND, OUR SUCCESS AND OUR COMPETITIVE POSITION. WE PERIODICALLY DISCOVER PRODUCTS THAT ARE COUNTERFEIT REPRODUCTIONS OF OUR PRODUCTS OR THAT OTHERWISE

INFRINGE ON OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS. IF WE ARE UNSUCCESSFUL IN CHALLENGING A PARTYS PRODUCTS ON THE BASIS OF TRADEMARK OR DESIGN INFRINGEMENT, CONTINUED SALES OF THESE PRODUCTS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR SALES AND OUR BRAND AND RESULT

IN THE SHIFT OF CONSUMER PREFERENCE AWAY FROM OUR PRODUCTS. THE ACTIONS WE TAKE TO ESTABLISH AND PROTECT TRADEMARKS, PATENTS, AND OTHER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS MAY NOT BE ADEQUATE TO PREVENT IMITATION OF OUR PRODUCTS BY OTHERS OR TO PREVENT

OTHERS FROM SEEKING TO BLOCK SALES OF OUR PRODUCTS AS VIOLATIONS OF PROPRIETARY RIGHTS.

IN ADDITION, THE LAWS OF CERTAIN FOREIGN COUNTRIES

MAY NOT PROTECT INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS TO THE SAME EXTENT AS DO THE LAWS OF THE UNITED STATES. WE MAY FACE SIGNIFICANT EXPENSES AND LIABILITY IN CONNECTION WITH THE PROTECTION OF OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES, AND

IF WE ARE UNABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY PROTECT OUR RIGHTS OR RESOLVE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY CONFLICTS WITH OTHERS, OUR BUSINESS OR FINANCIAL CONDITION MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

WE ARE SUBJECT TO PERIODIC LITIGATION AND OTHER REGULATORY PROCEEDINGS, WHICH COULD RESULT IN UNEXPECTED EXPENSE OF TIME AND RESOURCES.

WE ARE A DEFENDANT FROM TIME TO TIME IN LAWSUITS AND REGULATORY ACTIONS RELATING TO OUR BUSINESS. DUE TO THE INHERENT UNCERTAINTIES OF LITIGATION AND

REGULATORY PROCEEDINGS, WE CANNOT ACCURATELY PREDICT THE ULTIMATE OUTCOME OF ANY SUCH PROCEEDINGS. AN UNFAVORABLE OUTCOME COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. IN ADDITION, ANY SIGNIFICANT

LITIGATION IN THE FUTURE, REGARDLESS OF ITS MERITS, COULD DIVERT MANAGEMENTS ATTENTION FROM OUR OPERATIONS AND RESULT IN SUBSTANTIAL LEGAL FEES.

OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS INVOLVE INHERENT RISKS WHICH COULD RESULT IN HARM TO OUR BUSINESS.

VIRTUALLY ALL OF OUR

ATHLETIC FOOTWEAR AND APPAREL IS MANUFACTURED OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES, AND THE MAJORITY OF OUR PRODUCTS ARE SOLD OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES. ACCORDINGLY, WE ARE SUBJECT TO THE RISKS GENERALLY ASSOCIATED WITH GLOBAL TRADE AND DOING BUSINESS

ABROAD, WHICH INCLUDE FOREIGN LAWS AND REGULATIONS, VARYING CONSUMER PREFERENCES ACROSS GEOGRAPHIC REGIONS, POLITICAL UNREST, DISRUPTIONS OR DELAYS IN CROSS-BORDER SHIPMENTS AND CHANGES IN ECONOMIC CONDITIONS IN COUNTRIES IN WHICH WE MANUFACTURE OR

SELL PRODUCTS. IN ADDITION, DISEASE OUTBREAKS, TERRORIST ACTS AND MILITARY CONFLICT HAVE INCREASED THE RISKS OF DOING BUSINESS ABROAD. THESE FACTORS, AMONG OTHERS, COULD AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO MANUFACTURE PRODUCTS OR PROCURE MATERIALS, OUR ABILITY TO

IMPORT PRODUCTS, OUR ABILITY TO SELL PRODUCTS IN INTERNATIONAL MARKETS, AND OUR COST OF DOING BUSINESS. IF ANY OF THESE OR OTHER FACTORS MAKE THE CONDUCT OF BUSINESS IN A PARTICULAR COUNTRY UNDESIRABLE OR IMPRACTICAL, OUR BUSINESS COULD BE ADVERSELY

AFFECTED. IN ADDITION, MANY OF OUR IMPORTED PRODUCTS ARE SUBJECT TO DUTIES, TARIFFS OR QUOTAS THAT AFFECT THE COST AND QUANTITY OF VARIOUS TYPES OF GOODS IMPORTED INTO THE UNITED STATES AND OTHER COUNTRIES. ANY COUNTRY IN WHICH OUR PRODUCTS ARE

PRODUCED OR SOLD MAY ELIMINATE, ADJUST OR IMPOSE NEW QUOTAS, DUTIES, TARIFFS, SAFEGUARD MEASURES, ANTI-DUMPING DUTIES, CARGO RESTRICTIONS TO PREVENT TERRORISM, RESTRICTIONS ON THE TRANSFER OF CURRENCY, OR OTHER CHARGES OR RESTRICTIONS, ANY OF WHICH

COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. THE OUTCOMES OF AN ONGOING INVESTIGATION INTO ANTI-DUMPING PRACTICES IN THE EU, AND THE ANNUAL RENEWAL OF THE NTR WITH VIETNAM, EACH OF WHICH ARE DISCUSSED ELSEWHERE

IN THIS REPORT, COULD EACH HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR BUSINESS.

CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE FLUCTUATIONS COULD RESULT IN HIGHER COSTS AND DECREASED

MARGINS.

A MAJORITY OF OUR PRODUCTS ARE SOLD OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES. AS A RESULT, WE CONDUCT TRANSACTIONS IN VARIOUS

CURRENCIES, WHICH INCREASES OUR EXPOSURE TO FLUCTUATIONS IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES RELATIVE TO THE U.S. DOLLAR. OUR INTERNATIONAL REVENUES AND EXPENSES GENERALLY ARE DERIVED FROM SALES AND OPERATIONS IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES, AND THESE

REVENUES AND EXPENSES COULD BE AFFECTED BY CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS, INCLUDING AMOUNTS

14

TABLE OF CONTENTS

RECORDED IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES AND TRANSLATED INTO U.S. DOLLARS FOR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL REPORTING. CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE FLUCTUATIONS COULD ALSO DISRUPT

THE BUSINESS OF THE INDEPENDENT MANUFACTURERS THAT PRODUCE OUR PRODUCTS BY MAKING THEIR PURCHASES OF RAW MATERIALS MORE EXPENSIVE AND MORE DIFFICULT TO FINANCE. FOREIGN CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

WE ENGAGE IN HEDGING ACTIVITIES TO MITIGATE THE IMPACT OF THE TRANSLATION OF FOREIGN CURRENCIES ON OUR FINANCIAL

RESULTS.

SEE NOTE 16 TO OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, RISK MANAGEMENT AND DERIVATIVES.

OUR HEDGING ACTIVITIES ARE DESIGNED TO REDUCE AND DELAY, BUT NOT TO ELIMINATE, THE EFFECTS OF FOREIGN CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS. FACTORS THAT COULD AFFECT THE

EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR HEDGING ACTIVITIES INCLUDE ACCURACY OF SALES FORECASTS, VOLATILITY OF CURRENCY MARKETS, AND THE AVAILABILITY OF HEDGING INSTRUMENTS. SINCE THE HEDGING ACTIVITIES ARE DESIGNED TO REDUCE VOLATILITY, THEY NOT ONLY REDUCE THE

NEGATIVE IMPACT OF A STRONGER U.S. DOLLAR, BUT THEY ALSO REDUCE THE POSITIVE IMPACT OF A WEAKER U.S. DOLLAR. OUR FUTURE FINANCIAL RESULTS COULD BE SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTED BY THE VALUE OF THE U.S. DOLLAR IN RELATION TO THE FOREIGN CURRENCIES IN WHICH

WE CONDUCT BUSINESS. THE DEGREE TO WHICH OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS ARE AFFECTED FOR ANY GIVEN TIME PERIOD WILL DEPEND IN PART UPON OUR HEDGING ACTIVITIES.

OUR PRODUCTS ARE SUBJECT TO RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH OVERSEAS SOURCING, MANUFACTURING, AND FINANCING.

THE PRINCIPAL

MATERIALS USED IN OUR APPAREL PRODUCTS  NATURAL AND SYNTHETIC FABRICS AND THREADS, PLASTIC AND METAL HARDWARE, AND SPECIALIZED PERFORMANCE FABRICS DESIGNED TO REPEL RAIN, RETAIN HEAT, OR EFFICIENTLY TRANSPORT BODY MOISTURE  ARE AVAILABLE

IN COUNTRIES WHERE OUR MANUFACTURING TAKES PLACE. THE PRINCIPAL MATERIALS USED IN OUR FOOTWEAR PRODUCTS  NATURAL AND SYNTHETIC RUBBER, PLASTIC COMPOUNDS, FOAM CUSHIONING MATERIALS, NYLON, LEATHER, CANVAS AND POLYURETHANE FILMS  ARE ALSO

LOCALLY AVAILABLE TO MANUFACTURERS. NIKE CONTRACTORS AND SUPPLIERS BUY RAW MATERIALS IN BULK.

THERE COULD BE A SIGNIFICANT DISRUPTION IN

THE SUPPLY OF FABRICS OR RAW MATERIALS FROM CURRENT SOURCES OR, IN THE EVENT OF A DISRUPTION, WE MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO LOCATE ALTERNATIVE SUPPLIERS OF MATERIALS OF COMPARABLE QUALITY AT AN ACCEPTABLE PRICE, OR AT ALL. IN ADDITION, WE CANNOT BE

CERTAIN THAT OUR UNAFFILIATED MANUFACTURERS WILL BE ABLE TO FILL OUR ORDERS IN A TIMELY MANNER. IF WE EXPERIENCE SIGNIFICANT INCREASED DEMAND, OR NEED TO REPLACE AN EXISTING MANUFACTURER, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT ADDITIONAL SUPPLIES OF FABRICS

OR RAW MATERIALS OR ADDITIONAL MANUFACTURING CAPACITY WILL BE AVAILABLE WHEN REQUIRED ON TERMS THAT ARE ACCEPTABLE TO US, OR AT ALL, OR THAT ANY SUPPLIER OR MANUFACTURER WOULD ALLOCATE SUFFICIENT CAPACITY TO US IN ORDER TO MEET OUR REQUIREMENTS. IN

ADDITION, EVEN IF WE ARE ABLE TO EXPAND EXISTING OR FIND NEW MANUFACTURING OR SOURCES OF MATERIALS, WE MAY ENCOUNTER DELAYS IN PRODUCTION AND ADDED COSTS AS A RESULT OF THE TIME IT TAKES TO TRAIN OUR SUPPLIERS AND MANUFACTURERS IN OUR METHODS,

PRODUCTS, QUALITY CONTROL STANDARDS, AND LABOR, HEALTH AND SAFETY STANDARDS. ANY DELAYS, INTERRUPTION OR INCREASED COSTS IN THE SUPPLY OF MATERIALS OR MANUFACTURE OF OUR PRODUCTS COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR ABILITY TO MEET RETAIL CUSTOMER

AND CONSUMER DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS AND RESULT IN LOWER REVENUES AND NET INCOME BOTH IN THE SHORT AND LONG TERM.

BECAUSE INDEPENDENT

MANUFACTURERS MANUFACTURE A MAJORITY OF OUR PRODUCTS OUTSIDE OF OUR PRINCIPAL SALES MARKETS, OUR PRODUCTS MUST BE TRANSPORTED BY THIRD PARTIES OVER LARGE GEOGRAPHIC DISTANCES. DELAYS IN THE SHIPMENT OR DELIVERY OF OUR PRODUCTS DUE TO THE

AVAILABILITY OF TRANSPORTATION, WORK STOPPAGES, PORT STRIKES, OR OTHER FACTORS COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE. IN ADDITION, MANUFACTURING DELAYS OR UNEXPECTED DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS MAY REQUIRE US TO USE FASTER, BUT MORE

EXPENSIVE, TRANSPORTATION METHODS SUCH AS AIRCRAFT, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR PROFIT MARGINS. THE COST OF FUEL IS A SIGNIFICANT COMPONENT IN TRANSPORTATION COSTS, SO INCREASES IN THE PRICE OF PETROLEUM PRODUCTS CAN ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR PROFIT

MARGINS.

IN ADDITION, SOJITZ AMERICA PERFORMS SIGNIFICANT IMPORT-EXPORT FINANCING SERVICES FOR NEARLY ALL OF THE NIKE BRAND PRODUCTS SOLD

OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES, EUROPE, MIDDLE EAST, AFRICA AND JAPAN, EXCLUDING PRODUCTS PRODUCED AND SOLD IN THE SAME COUNTRY. ANY FAILURE OF SOJITZ AMERICA TO PROVIDE THESE SERVICES OR ANY FAILURE OF SOJITZ AMERICAS BANKS COULD DISRUPT OUR

ABILITY TO ACQUIRE PRODUCTS FROM OUR SUPPLIERS AND TO DELIVER PRODUCTS TO OUR CUSTOMERS OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES, EUROPE, MIDDLE EAST, AFRICA, AND JAPAN. SUCH A DISRUPTION COULD RESULT IN CANCELLED ORDERS THAT WOULD ADVERSELY AFFECT SALES AND

PROFITABILITY.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

OUR SUCCESS DEPENDS ON OUR GLOBAL DISTRIBUTION FACILITIES.

WE DISTRIBUTE OUR PRODUCTS TO CUSTOMERS DIRECTLY FROM THE FACTORY AND THROUGH DISTRIBUTION CENTERS LOCATED THROUGHOUT THE WORLD. OUR ABILITY TO MEET

CUSTOMER EXPECTATIONS, MANAGE INVENTORY, COMPLETE SALES AND ACHIEVE OBJECTIVES FOR OPERATING EFFICIENCIES DEPENDS ON THE PROPER OPERATION OF OUR DISTRIBUTION FACILITIES, THE DEVELOPMENT OR EXPANSION OF ADDITIONAL DISTRIBUTION CAPABILITIES, AND THE

TIMELY PERFORMANCE OF SERVICES BY THIRD PARTIES (INCLUDING THOSE INVOLVED IN SHIPPING PRODUCT TO AND FROM OUR DISTRIBUTION FACILITIES). OUR DISTRIBUTION FACILITIES COULD BE INTERRUPTED BY INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY PROBLEMS AND DISASTERS SUCH AS

EARTHQUAKES OR FIRES. ANY SIGNIFICANT FAILURE IN OUR DISTRIBUTION FACILITIES COULD RESULT IN AN ADVERSE AFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS. WE MAINTAIN BUSINESS INTERRUPTION INSURANCE, BUT IT MAY NOT ADEQUATELY PROTECT US FROM THE ADVERSE EFFECT THAT COULD BE

CAUSED BY SIGNIFICANT DISRUPTIONS IN OUR DISTRIBUTION FACILITIES.

WE RELY SIGNIFICANTLY ON INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY IN OUR SUPPLY CHAIN, AND ANY

FAILURE, INADEQUACY, INTERRUPTION OR SECURITY FAILURE OF THAT TECHNOLOGY COULD HARM OUR ABILITY TO EFFECTIVELY OPERATE OUR BUSINESS.

WE ARE HEAVILY DEPENDENT ON INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS ACROSS OUR SUPPLY CHAIN, INCLUDING FOR DESIGN, PRODUCTION, FORECASTING, ORDERING, MANUFACTURING, TRANSPORTATION, SALES, AND DISTRIBUTION. OUR ABILITY TO EFFECTIVELY MANAGE AND

MAINTAIN OUR INVENTORY AND TO SHIP PRODUCTS TO CUSTOMERS ON A TIMELY BASIS DEPENDS SIGNIFICANTLY ON THE RELIABILITY OF THESE SUPPLY CHAIN SYSTEMS. OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS, AS PART OF THE ONGOING INITIATIVE TO UPGRADE OUR WORLDWIDE SUPPLY CHAIN,

WE HAVE IMPLEMENTED NEW SYSTEMS IN CANADA, AND THE U.S., EMEA, AND ASIA PACIFIC REGIONS AND ARE NOW IMPLEMENTING THEM IN THE AMERICAS REGIONS. OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS, WE WILL WORK TO CONTINUE TO ENHANCE THE SYSTEMS AND RELATED PROCESSES IN THESE

OPERATIONS AND COMPLETE THE IMPLEMENTATION OF NEW SYSTEMS IN THE REMAINDER OF OUR GLOBAL OPERATIONS. THE FAILURE OF THESE SYSTEMS TO OPERATE EFFECTIVELY, PROBLEMS WITH TRANSITIONING TO UPGRADED OR REPLACEMENT SYSTEMS, OR A BREACH IN SECURITY OF

THESE SYSTEMS COULD CAUSE DELAYS IN PRODUCT FULFILLMENT AND REDUCED EFFICIENCY OF OUR OPERATIONS, AND IT COULD REQUIRE SIGNIFICANT CAPITAL INVESTMENTS TO REMEDIATE THE PROBLEM.

WE DEPEND ON KEY PERSONNEL, THE LOSS OF WHOM WOULD HARM OUR BUSINESS.

OUR FUTURE SUCCESS WILL

DEPEND IN PART ON THE CONTINUED SERVICE OF KEY EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AND PERSONNEL. THE LOSS OF THE SERVICES OF ANY KEY INDIVIDUALS COULD HARM US. OUR FUTURE SUCCESS ALSO DEPENDS ON OUR ABILITY TO IDENTIFY, ATTRACT AND RETAIN ADDITIONAL QUALIFIED

PERSONNEL. COMPETITION FOR EMPLOYEES IN OUR INDUSTRY IS INTENSE AND WE MAY NOT BE SUCCESSFUL IN ATTRACTING AND RETAINING SUCH PERSONNEL.

THE SALE OF

A LARGE NUMBER OF SHARES HELD BY OUR CHAIRMAN COULD DEPRESS THE MARKET PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK.

PHILIP H. KNIGHT, THE CHAIRMAN OF

OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS, BENEFICIALLY OWNS OVER 90 PERCENT OF OUR CLASS A COMMON STOCK AND, IF IT WAS CONVERTED INTO CLASS B COMMON STOCK, 24 PERCENT OF OUR CLASS B COMMON STOCK. THESE SHARES ARE AVAILABLE FOR RESALE, SUBJECT TO THE REQUIREMENTS

OF THE U.S. SECURITIES LAWS. THE SALE OR PROSPECT OF THE SALE OF A SUBSTANTIAL NUMBER OF THESE SHARES COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE MARKET PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK.

ANTI-TAKEOVER PROVISIONS MAY IMPAIR AN ACQUISITION OF THE COMPANY OR REDUCE THE PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK.

THERE ARE PROVISIONS OF OUR ARTICLES OF INCORPORATION AND OREGON LAW THAT ARE INTENDED TO PROTECT SHAREHOLDER INTERESTS BY PROVIDING THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS A MEANS TO ATTEMPT TO DENY COERCIVE TAKEOVER ATTEMPTS OR TO

NEGOTIATE WITH A POTENTIAL ACQUIRER IN ORDER TO OBTAIN MORE FAVORABLE TERMS. SUCH PROVISIONS INCLUDE A CONTROL SHARE ACQUISITION STATUTE, A FREEZEOUT STATUTE, TWO CLASSES OF STOCK THAT VOTE SEPARATELY ON CERTAIN ISSUES, AND THE FACT THAT THE HOLDERS

OF CLASS A COMMON STOCK SHARES ELECT THREE-FOURTHS OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS ROUNDED DOWN TO THE NEXT WHOLE NUMBER. HOWEVER, SUCH PROVISIONS COULD DISCOURAGE, DELAY OR PREVENT AN UNSOLICITED MERGER, ACQUISITION OR OTHER CHANGE IN CONTROL OF THE

COMPANY THAT SOME SHAREHOLDERS MIGHT BELIEVE TO BE IN THEIR BEST INTERESTS, OR IN WHICH SHAREHOLDERS MIGHT RECEIVE A PREMIUM FOR THEIR COMMON STOCK OVER THE PREVAILING MARKET PRICE. THESE PROVISIONS COULD ALSO DISCOURAGE PROXY CONTESTS FOR CONTROL

OF THE COMPANY.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

WE MAY FAIL TO MEET ANALYST EXPECTATIONS, WHICH COULD CAUSE THE PRICE OF OUR STOCK TO DECLINE.

OUR COMMON STOCK IS TRADED PUBLICLY, AND AT ANY GIVEN TIME VARIOUS SECURITIES ANALYSTS FOLLOW OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS AND ISSUE REPORTS ON US. THESE

REPORTS INCLUDE INFORMATION ABOUT OUR HISTORICAL FINANCIAL RESULTS AS WELL AS THE ANALYSTS ESTIMATES OF OUR FUTURE PERFORMANCE. THE ANALYSTS ESTIMATES ARE BASED UPON THEIR OWN OPINIONS AND ARE OFTEN DIFFERENT FROM OUR ESTIMATES OR

EXPECTATIONS. IF OUR OPERATING RESULTS ARE BELOW THE ESTIMATES OR EXPECTATIONS OF PUBLIC MARKET ANALYSTS AND INVESTORS, OUR STOCK PRICE COULD DECLINE. IN THE PAST, SECURITIES CLASS ACTION LITIGATION HAS BEEN BROUGHT AGAINST NIKE AND OTHER COMPANIES

FOLLOWING A DECLINE IN THE MARKET PRICE OF THEIR SECURITIES. IF OUR STOCK PRICE IS VOLATILE, WE MAY BECOME INVOLVED IN THIS TYPE OF LITIGATION IN THE FUTURE. ANY LITIGATION COULD RESULT IN SUBSTANTIAL COSTS AND A DIVERSION OF MANAGEMENTS

ATTENTION AND RESOURCES THAT ARE NEEDED TO SUCCESSFULLY RUN OUR BUSINESS.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

OVERVIEW

NIKE DESIGNS, DEVELOPS AND MARKETS HIGH QUALITY FOOTWEAR, APPAREL, EQUIPMENT AND ACCESSORY

PRODUCTS WORLDWIDE. WE ARE THE LARGEST SELLER OF ATHLETIC FOOTWEAR AND ATHLETIC APPAREL IN THE WORLD AND SELL OUR PRODUCTS PRIMARILY THROUGH A COMBINATION OF RETAIL ACCOUNTS, NIKE-OWNED RETAIL STORES, INDEPENDENT DISTRIBUTORS AND LICENSEES, IN THE

UNITED STATES AND OVER 160 COUNTRIES WORLDWIDE. OUR GOAL IS TO DELIVER VALUE TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS BY BUILDING A PROFITABLE PORTFOLIO OF GLOBAL FOOTWEAR, APPAREL, EQUIPMENT AND ACCESSORIES BRANDS. OUR STRATEGY FOR BUILDING THIS PORTFOLIO IS FOCUSED IN

FOUR KEY AREAS.



DEEPENING OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH CONSUMERS;



DELIVERING SUPERIOR, INNOVATIVE PRODUCTS TO THE MARKETPLACE;



MAKING OUR SUPPLY CHAIN A COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE, THROUGH OPERATIONAL DISCIPLINE AND EXCELLENCE; AND



ACCELERATING GROWTH THROUGH FOCUSED EXECUTION.

BY

EXECUTING THIS STRATEGY, WE AIM TO DELIVER THE FOLLOWING LONG-TERM FINANCIAL GOALS.



HIGH SINGLE DIGIT REVENUE GROWTH;



MID-TEENS EARNINGS PER SHARE GROWTH;



INCREASED RETURN ON INVESTED CAPITAL AND ACCELERATED CASH FLOWS; AND



CONSISTENT RESULTS THROUGH EFFECTIVE MANAGEMENT OF OUR DIVERSIFIED PORTFOLIO OF BUSINESSES.

IN FISCAL 2006, WE MET MOST OF THESE FINANCIAL GOALS. OUR REVENUES GREW 9% TO $15 BILLION, NET INCOME GREW 15% TO $1.4 BILLION, AND WE DELIVERED DILUTED

EARNINGS PER SHARE OF $5.28, AN 18% INCREASE VERSUS FISCAL 2005. THESE REPORTED RESULTS INCLUDED A $51.9 MILLION CHARGE RELATED TO AN UNFAVORABLE ARBITRATION RULING INVOLVING OUR CONVERSE SUBSIDIARY (SEE

NOTE 5  ACCRUED LIABILITIES

IN

THE ACCOMPANYING

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

FOR MORE INFORMATION ON THE CONVERSE ARBITRATION CHARGE). EXCLUDING THIS CHARGE, OUR NET INCOME GREW 17% AND WE DELIVERED DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE OF $5.39, A 20% INCREASE VERSUS

FISCAL 2005. FOR FISCAL 2006, OUR CONSOLIDATED GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE DECREASED 50 BASIS POINTS TO 44.0% PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER IN-LINE NET PRICING MARGINS (NET REVENUE FOR CURRENT PRODUCT OFFERINGS MINUS PRODUCT COSTS) PARTIALLY OFFSET BY

IMPROVEMENTS IN YEAR-OVER-YEAR CURRENCY HEDGE RATES. THE DECLINE IN THE GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE AND THE CONVERSE ARBITRATION CHARGE WERE MORE THAN OFFSET BY 80 BASIS POINTS OF SELLING AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE LEVERAGE (DUE ENTIRELY TO SLOWING THE

GROWTH OF OPERATING OVERHEAD SPENDING), AND HIGHER INTEREST INCOME RESULTING IN A HIGHER PRE-TAX INCOME MARGIN IN FISCAL 2006 THAN IN FISCAL 2005. IN ADDITION, WE INCREASED FREE CASH FLOW FROM OPERATIONS AND

20

TABLE OF CONTENTS

CONTINUED TO RETURN LARGER AMOUNTS OF CASH TO SHAREHOLDERS THROUGH HIGHER DIVIDENDS AND INCREASED SHARE REPURCHASES. OUR RETURN ON INVESTED CAPITAL DECLINED

SLIGHTLY AS COMPARED TO FISCAL 2005. ALTHOUGH WE MAY NOT MEET ALL OF THE FINANCIAL GOALS OUTLINED ABOVE IN ANY PARTICULAR FISCAL QUARTER OR FISCAL YEAR, WE CONTINUE TO BELIEVE THESE ARE APPROPRIATE LONG-TERM GOALS.

IN FISCAL 2006, CHANGES IN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES REDUCED THE REPORTED CONSOLIDATED REVENUE GROWTH BY 1 PERCENTAGE POINT. THE U.S. REGION CONTRIBUTED 4

PERCENTAGE POINTS OF THE CONSOLIDATED REVENUE GROWTH FOR FISCAL 2006. EXCLUDING THE IMPACT OF CHANGES IN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES, REVENUE GROWTH IN OUR INTERNATIONAL REGIONS CONTRIBUTED 4 PERCENTAGE POINTS OF THE CONSOLIDATED REVENUE GROWTH FOR

FISCAL 2006, AS ALL OF OUR INTERNATIONAL REGIONS POSTED HIGHER REVENUES. SALES IN OUR OTHER BUSINESSES DROVE THE REMAINDER OF THE CONSOLIDATED REVENUE GROWTH FOR FISCAL 2006. REVENUES FOR OUR OTHER BUSINESSES ARE COMPRISED SUBSTANTIALLY OF RESULTS

FISCAL 2005 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2004

IN FISCAL 2005, 3 PERCENTAGE POINTS OF THE REVENUE GROWTH WERE ATTRIBUTED TO CHANGES IN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES, PRIMARILY THE STRONGER EURO. EXCLUDING

THE IMPACT OF CHANGES IN FOREIGN CURRENCY, REVENUE GROWTH IN OUR INTERNATIONAL REGIONS CONTRIBUTED 4 PERCENTAGE POINTS TO THE CONSOLIDATED REVENUE GROWTH, AS ALL OF OUR INTERNATIONAL REGIONS POSTED HIGHER REVENUES. THE U.S. REGION CONTRIBUTED 3

FISCAL 2006 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2005

DURING FISCAL 2006, OUR CONSOLIDATED GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE DECLINED 50 BASIS POINTS VERSUS THE PRIOR YEAR. THE PRIMARY FACTORS CONTRIBUTING TO THE

REDUCED GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE FOR FISCAL 2006 WERE AS FOLLOWS.

(1)

LOWER FOOTWEAR IN-LINE NET PRICING MARGINS IN THE U.S., EUROPE, MIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA (EMEA) AND ASIA PACIFIC REGIONS. THE LOWER FOOTWEAR IN-LINE NET PRICING MARGINS

WERE DUE TO HIGHER PRODUCT COSTS, PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF HIGHER OIL PRICES; ADDITIONAL COSTS INCURRED TO MEET STRONG FOOTWEAR UNIT DEMAND IN THE U.S.; HIGHER SALES INCENTIVES IN EMEA AND ASIA PACIFIC; STRATEGIES TO IMPROVE CONSUMER VALUE IN EMEA

AND JAPAN; AND A SHIFT IN THE MIX OF FOOTWEAR MODELS SOLD TOWARDS MODELS WITH LOWER MARGINS WITHIN EMEA AND JAPAN.

(2)

A SHIFT IN THE MIX OF REVENUES REPORTED FROM OUR OPERATING SEGMENTS TOWARDS REGIONS AND SUBSIDIARIES WITH LOWER MARGINS.

THE FACTORS DRIVING A REDUCED GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY.

(1)

YEAR-OVER-YEAR CURRENCY HEDGE RATE IMPROVEMENTS, PRIMARILY FOR THE EURO.

(2)

IMPROVED GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGES IN OUR OTHER BUSINESSES DRIVEN BY IMPROVEMENTS AT CONVERSE, HURLEY AND NIKE GOLF.

FISCAL 2005 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2004

DURING FISCAL 2005, OUR CONSOLIDATED GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE IMPROVED 160 BASIS POINTS VERSUS THE PRIOR YEAR. THE PRIMARY FACTORS CONTRIBUTING TO THE IMPROVED GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE FOR FISCAL 2005 WERE AS FOLLOWS.

(1)

HIGHER GROSS MARGINS IN OUR INTERNATIONAL REGIONS, DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY OUR EMEA REGION. THIS IMPROVEMENT WAS DRIVEN BY CHANGES IN CURRENCY HEDGE RATES, PRIMARILY THE EURO, PARTIALLY

OFFSET BY LOWER IN-LINE NET PRICING MARGINS AND A HIGHER PERCENTAGE OF LESS PROFITABLE CLOSEOUT SALES (NON-CURRENT PRODUCT OFFERINGS) IN OUR EMEA AND ASIA PACIFIC REGIONS. THE LOWER IN-LINE NET PRICING MARGINS WERE DUE TO STRATEGIES TO IMPROVE

CONSUMER VALUE. THE INCREASED LEVELS OF CLOSEOUT SALES AND LOWER CLOSEOUT PRICING WERE THE RESULT OF THE LIQUIDATION OF HIGHER FOOTWEAR AND APPAREL CLOSEOUT INVENTORIES IN OUR EMEA AND ASIA PACIFIC REGIONS.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

(2)

HIGHER GROSS MARGINS IN THE U.S. REGION PRIMARILY DUE TO FEWER, MORE PROFITABLE CLOSEOUTS IN FOOTWEAR PARTIALLY OFFSET BY INCREASED SALES DISCOUNTS AND HIGHER COSTS INCURRED TO MEET

STRONG FOOTWEAR UNIT DEMAND.

(3)

IMPROVED GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGES IN OUR OTHER BUSINESSES DRIVEN BY THE ADDITION OF CONVERSE (ACQUIRED IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2004) AND EXETER BRANDS GROUP (FORMED IN THE

FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2005). BOTH EXETER BRANDS GROUP AND THE INTERNATIONAL PORTION OF CONVERSES BUSINESS OPERATE ON A LICENSING MODEL, WHICH CARRIES HIGHER GROSS MARGINS AND LOWER OPERATING EXPENSES THAN THE REMAINDER OF OUR OTHER

BUSINESSES.

FISCAL 2006 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2005

IN FISCAL 2006, SELLING AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES DECREASED AS A PERCENTAGE OF REVENUES BY 80 BASIS POINTS FOR THE YEAR DRIVEN BY OPERATING OVERHEAD LEVERAGE. CHANGES IN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES REDUCED SELLING AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE

GROWTH BY 1 PERCENTAGE POINT.

IN FISCAL 2006, CHANGES IN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES REDUCED THE RATE OF GROWTH IN DEMAND CREATION BY

1 PERCENTAGE POINT. THE GROWTH IN DEMAND CREATION SPENDING IN FISCAL 2006 WAS IN LINE WITH OUR REVENUE GROWTH. THE YEAR-OVER-YEAR INCREASE IN DEMAND CREATION SPENDING WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASED SPENDING ON SPORTS MARKETING ENDORSEMENT

CONTRACTS AND EVENTS, INCREASED SPENDING ON RETAIL MARKETING PROGRAMS (IN-STORE MARKETING AT OUR RETAIL PARTNERS), AND ADVERTISING PRIMARILY AROUND THE GLOBAL WORLD CUP AND WINTER OLYMPICS CAMPAIGNS AND FOR THE GLOBAL AIR MAX 360



FOOTWEAR LAUNCH.

WHILE CONSOLIDATED REVENUES GREW 9% IN FISCAL 2006, OPERATING OVERHEAD FOR FISCAL 2006 INCREASED ONLY 4% OVER FISCAL 2005 AS A RESULT OF EXPENSE

MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES TO SLOW THE GROWTH OF OPERATING OVERHEAD SPENDING. CHANGES IN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES REDUCED THE RATE OF GROWTH IN OPERATING OVERHEAD BY 1 PERCENTAGE POINT. EXCLUDING THE EFFECTS OF CHANGES IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE

RATES, THE INCREASE IN OPERATING OVERHEAD FOR FISCAL 2006 VERSUS FISCAL 2005 WAS MAINLY ATTRIBUTABLE TO HIGHER PERSONNEL COSTS (BOTH INCREASED HEADCOUNT AND HIGHER COMPENSATION) TO SUPPORT THE GROWTH OF OUR BUSINESS, INCLUDING OUR OTHER BUSINESSES

AND NEW NIKE-OWNED RETAIL STORES.

FISCAL 2005 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2004

IN FISCAL 2005, 3 PERCENTAGE POINTS OF THE SELLING AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE INCREASE WERE DUE TO CHANGES IN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES. THE IMPACT OF A

FULL FISCAL YEAR FOR CONVERSE AND THE FORMATION OF EXETER BRANDS GROUP ADDED 1 PERCENTAGE POINT OF GROWTH.

IN FISCAL 2005, 3 PERCENTAGE

POINTS OF THE INCREASE IN DEMAND CREATION WERE DUE TO CHANGES IN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES. EXCLUDING THE IMPACT OF CHANGES IN FOREIGN CURRENCY RATES, THE INCREASE IN DEMAND CREATION SPENDING FOR THE FISCAL YEAR WAS ATTRIBUTABLE TO HIGHER SPENDING ON

SPORTS MARKETING ENDORSEMENT CONTRACTS AND

CHANGES IN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES CONTRIBUTED 3 PERCENTAGE POINTS OF THE INCREASE TO OPERATING OVERHEAD EXPENSE IN FISCAL 2005. EXCLUDING THE EFFECTS OF

FOREIGN CURRENCY, OPERATING OVERHEAD INCREASES FOR FISCAL 2005 WERE MAINLY ATTRIBUTABLE TO HIGHER PERSONNEL COSTS (BOTH INCREASED HEADCOUNT AND HIGHER COMPENSATION), INVESTMENTS IN EMERGING MARKETS (SUCH AS CHINA, INDIA AND OUR CENTRAL EUROPE,

MIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA UNIT) AND OUR OTHER BUSINESSES, INCREASED COSTS DUE TO SALES AND LEADERSHIP EVENTS AND HIGHER SPENDING ASSOCIATED WITH NEW NIKE-OWNED RETAIL STORES.

FISCAL 2006 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2005

THE SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN OTHER EXPENSE, NET FOR FISCAL 2006 AS COMPARED TO FISCAL 2005 WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY FOREIGN CURRENCY HEDGE GAINS IN FISCAL

2006 COMPARED TO FOREIGN CURRENCY HEDGE LOSSES IN THE PRIOR YEAR, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE CONVERSE ARBITRATION CHARGE. THE FISCAL 2006 HEDGE GAINS PRIMARILY REFLECTED THAT THE EURO HAD WEAKENED SINCE WE ENTERED INTO THESE HEDGE CONTRACTS AND ARE

REFLECTED IN THE CORPORATE LINE IN OUR SEGMENT PRESENTATION OF PRE-TAX INCOME IN THE ACCOMPANYING

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (NOTE 17  OPERATING SEGMENTS AND RELATED INFORMATION).

IN FISCAL 2006, THESE NET FOREIGN CURRENCY HEDGE GAINS WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY UNFAVORABLE U.S. DOLLAR TRANSLATION OF FOREIGN CURRENCY DENOMINATED

PROFITS, MOST SIGNIFICANTLY IN THE EMEA REGION. WE ESTIMATE THAT THE COMBINATION OF NET FOREIGN CURRENCY HEDGE GAINS IN OTHER EXPENSE, NET, AND THE UNFAVORABLE U.S. DOLLAR TRANSLATION OF FOREIGN CURRENCY DENOMINATED PROFITS RESULTED IN AN INCREASE

TO CONSOLIDATED INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES OF APPROXIMATELY $55 MILLION FOR FISCAL 2006 COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR.

FISCAL 2005

COMPARED TO FISCAL 2004

THE MOST SIGNIFICANT COMPONENT OF OTHER EXPENSE, NET, OF $29.1 MILLION FOR FISCAL 2005 WAS FOREIGN CURRENCY

HEDGE LOSSES. THE HEDGE LOSSES REFLECTED THAT THE EURO HAD STRENGTHENED SINCE WE ENTERED INTO THESE HEDGE CONTRACTS. IN FISCAL 2004, FOREIGN CURRENCY HEDGE LOSSES WERE ALSO THE MOST SIGNIFICANT COMPONENT OF OTHER EXPENSE, NET, OF $74.7 MILLION. THE

YEAR-OVER-YEAR IMPROVEMENT IN OTHER EXPENSE, NET, FOR FISCAL 2005 WAS MAINLY DUE TO LOWER FOREIGN CURRENCY HEDGE LOSSES AND LOWER NET LOSSES ON ASSET DISPOSALS COMPARED TO THOSE RECORDED IN FISCAL 2004.

IN FISCAL 2005, THESE NET FOREIGN CURRENCY LOSSES IN OTHER EXPENSE, NET, WERE MORE THAN OFFSET BY FAVORABLE U.S. DOLLAR TRANSLATION OF FOREIGN CURRENCY

DENOMINATED PROFITS, MOST SIGNIFICANTLY IN THE EMEA REGION. WE ESTIMATE THAT THE COMBINATION OF NET FOREIGN CURRENCY HEDGE LOSSES IN OTHER EXPENSE, NET, AND THE FAVORABLE U.S. DOLLAR TRANSLATION OF FOREIGN CURRENCY DENOMINATED PROFITS RESULTED IN AN

INCREASE TO CONSOLIDATED INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES OF APPROXIMATELY $95 MILLION FOR FISCAL 2005 COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR.

FISCAL 2006 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2005

OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR FISCAL 2006 WAS CONSISTENT WITH THE RATE REPORTED FOR FISCAL 2005.

DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2006, OUR CEO AND BOARD OF DIRECTORS APPROVED A DOMESTIC REINVESTMENT PLAN AS REQUIRED BY THE AMERICAN JOBS CREATION

ACT OF 2004 (THE ACT) TO REPATRIATE $500 MILLION OF FOREIGN EARNINGS IN FISCAL 2006. THE ACT CREATES A TEMPORARY INCENTIVE FOR U.S. MULTINATIONAL CORPORATIONS TO REPATRIATE ACCUMULATED INCOME EARNED OUTSIDE THE U.S. BY PROVIDING AN 85%

DIVIDEND RECEIVED DEDUCTION FOR CERTAIN DIVIDENDS FROM CONTROLLED FOREIGN CORPORATIONS. A $500 MILLION REPATRIATION WAS MADE DURING THE QUARTER ENDING MAY 31, 2006 COMPRISED OF BOTH FOREIGN EARNINGS FOR WHICH U.S. TAXES HAS PREVIOUSLY BEEN

PROVIDED AND FOREIGN EARNINGS THAT HAD BEEN DESIGNATED AS PERMANENTLY REINVESTED. ACCORDINGLY, THE PROVISIONS MADE DID NOT HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE COMPANYS INCOME TAX EXPENSE OR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR THE YEAR.

FISCAL 2005 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2004

OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR FISCAL 2005 WAS SLIGHTLY HIGHER THAN THE FISCAL 2004 RATE PRIMARILY DUE TO DECREASES IN TAX CREDITS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER TAXES ON FOREIGN EARNINGS IN FISCAL 2005.

DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF FISCAL 2005, WE DECIDED TO REPATRIATE $500 MILLION OF FOREIGN EARNINGS DURING FISCAL 2006 UNDER THE ACT. AS DISCUSSED ABOVE,

BECAUSE WE ELECTED TO REPATRIATE A COMBINATION OF FOREIGN EARNINGS FOR WHICH U.S. TAXES HAD PREVIOUSLY BEEN PROVIDED AND FOREIGN EARNINGS THAT HAD BEEN DESIGNATED AS PERMANENTLY REINVESTED, THE PROVISIONS MADE DID NOT HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR

INCOME TAX EXPENSE OR OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR FISCAL 2005.

FUTURES ORDERS

WORLDWIDE FUTURES AND ADVANCE ORDERS FOR FOOTWEAR AND APPAREL SCHEDULED FOR DELIVERY FROM JUNE THROUGH NOVEMBER 2006 WERE 5.0% HIGHER THAN SUCH ORDERS

REPORTED FOR THE COMPARABLE PERIOD OF FISCAL 2005. THIS FUTURES GROWTH RATE IS CALCULATED BASED UPON OUR FORECASTS OF THE ACTUAL EXCHANGE RATES UNDER WHICH OUR REVENUES WILL BE TRANSLATED DURING THIS PERIOD, WHICH APPROXIMATE CURRENT SPOT RATES. THE

NET EFFECT FROM CHANGES IN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES DID NOT HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THIS REPORTED GROWTH VERSUS THE SAME PERIOD LAST YEAR. SLIGHTLY HIGHER AVERAGE SELLING PRICES FOR BOTH FOOTWEAR AND APPAREL CONTRIBUTED APPROXIMATELY 1

PERCENTAGE POINT OF THE GROWTH IN OVERALL FUTURES AND ADVANCE ORDERS. THE REMAINING 4 PERCENTAGE POINTS OF THE INCREASE WERE DUE TO VOLUME INCREASES FOR BOTH FOOTWEAR AND APPAREL. THE REPORTED FUTURES AND ADVANCE ORDERS GROWTH IS NOT NECESSARILY

INDICATIVE OF OUR EXPECTATION OF REVENUE GROWTH DURING THIS PERIOD. THIS IS BECAUSE THE MIX OF ORDERS CAN SHIFT BETWEEN ADVANCE/FUTURES AND AT-ONCE ORDERS. IN ADDITION, EXCHANGE RATE FLUCTUATIONS AS WELL AS DIFFERING LEVELS OF ORDER CANCELLATIONS

AND DISCOUNTS CAN CAUSE DIFFERENCES IN THE COMPARISONS BETWEEN FUTURES AND ADVANCE ORDERS, AND ACTUAL REVENUES. MOREOVER, A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR REVENUE IS NOT DERIVED FROM FUTURES AND ADVANCE ORDERS, INCLUDING AT-ONCE AND CLOSEOUT SALES OF

NIKE FOOTWEAR AND APPAREL, WHOLESALE SALES OF EQUIPMENT, U.S. LICENSED TEAM APPAREL, COLE HAAN, CONVERSE, EXETER BRANDS GROUP, HURLEY, NIKE BAUER HOCKEY, NIKE GOLF AND RETAIL SALES ACROSS ALL BRANDS.

FISCAL 2006 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2005

THE INCREASE IN FOOTWEAR REVENUES WAS DUE TO A STRONG INCREASE IN UNIT SALES, ACCOUNTING FOR 12 PERCENTAGE POINTS OF THE GROWTH, AND AN INCREASE IN THE

AVERAGE SELLING PRICE PER PAIR, ACCOUNTING FOR 2 PERCENTAGE POINTS OF THE GROWTH. THE STRONG UNIT INCREASE WAS DRIVEN BY INCREASED CONSUMER DEMAND ACROSS A MAJORITY OF THE FOOTWEAR PRODUCT CATEGORIES, MOST SIGNIFICANTLY HIGH DEMAND FOR OUR JORDAN

BRANDED AND SPORT CULTURE PRODUCTS. THE HIGHER AVERAGE SELLING PRICE PER PAIR WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASED CONSUMER DEMAND FOR PRODUCTS WITH A SUGGESTED RETAIL PRICE OVER $100, DRIVEN BY JORDAN BRANDED PRODUCTS AS WELL AS NIKE BRANDED SPORT

PERFORMANCE AND SPORT CULTURE PRODUCTS.

THE INCREASE IN U.S. APPAREL SALES FOR FISCAL 2006 WAS DRIVEN BY INCREASED UNIT SALES IN NIKE AND

JORDAN BRANDED APPAREL, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY SALES DECLINES IN LICENSED APPAREL, PRIMARILY DUE TO THE EXPIRATION OF OUR LICENSE AGREEMENT WITH THE NBA IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2005. THE INCREASES IN NIKE BRANDED APPAREL WERE PRIMARILY DUE TO

INCREASED SALES OF SPORT PERFORMANCE PRODUCTS.

FOR THE U.S. REGION, THE INCREASE IN PRE-TAX INCOME FOR FISCAL 2006 AS COMPARED TO 2005 WAS

DRIVEN BY HIGHER REVENUES AND LOWER SELLING AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES AS A PERCENTAGE OF REVENUES, MORE THAN OFFSETTING A LOWER GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE. THE LOWER GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE WAS PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF LOWER IN-LINE NET PRICING

MARGINS FOR FOOTWEAR DUE TO HIGHER PRODUCT COSTS, PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF HIGHER OIL PRICES, AND ADDITIONAL COSTS INCURRED TO MEET STRONG FOOTWEAR UNIT DEMAND. SELLING AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES WERE HIGHER THAN FISCAL 2005, BUT REPRESENTED A LOWER

PERCENTAGE OF REVENUES DUE TO OPERATING OVERHEAD LEVERAGE. THE INCREASE IN SELLING AND ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS WAS DUE TO INCREASES IN BOTH DEMAND CREATION AND OPERATING OVERHEAD. THE INCREASE IN DEMAND CREATION WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY INCREASED

SPENDING ON SPORTS MARKETING ENDORSEMENTS AND EVENTS AND INCREASED ADVERTISING, PRIMARILY DUE TO THE GLOBAL CAMPAIGNS DISCUSSED ABOVE. THE INCREASE IN OPERATING OVERHEAD SPENDING WAS DRIVEN BY INCREASED SPENDING FOR NEW NIKE-OWNED RETAIL STORES,

HIGHER PERSONNEL COSTS AND HIGHER TRAVEL AND MEETING EXPENSES.

FISCAL 2005 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2004

THE INCREASE IN FOOTWEAR REVENUE WAS DUE TO A 5 PERCENTAGE POINT INCREASE IN UNIT SALES AND A 4 PERCENTAGE POINT INCREASE IN THE AVERAGE PRICE PER PAIR.

THE INCREASES IN UNIT SALES AND THE AVERAGE PRICE PER PAIR WERE DUE TO INCREASED CONSUMER DEMAND FOR SPORT PERFORMANCE PRODUCTS, ESPECIALLY THOSE WITH A SUGGESTED RETAIL PRICE OVER $100.

27

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE INCREASE IN APPAREL SALES FOR FISCAL 2005 WAS DRIVEN BY VOLUME INCREASES IN BRANDED APPAREL,

PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECLINE IN REVENUE FROM SALES OF LICENSED APPAREL. THE DECLINE IN REVENUE FROM LICENSED APPAREL WAS DUE TO THE EXPIRATION OF OUR LICENSE AGREEMENT WITH THE NBA, IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2005, AND A SHIFT IN CONSUMER

PREFERENCE TOWARDS BRANDED APPAREL.

FOR FISCAL 2005, HIGHER REVENUES, AN IMPROVED GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE, AND SLIGHTLY LOWER SELLING AND

ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES AS A PERCENTAGE OF REVENUES DROVE THE U.S. REGION PRE-TAX INCOME INCREASE. THE IMPROVED GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE WAS PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF FEWER, MORE PROFITABLE CLOSEOUT SALES PARTIALLY OFFSET BY INCREASED SALES DISCOUNTS

(THE RESULT OF INCREASED SALES TO HIGH VOLUME ACCOUNTS) AND HIGHER COSTS INCURRED TO MEET STRONG FOOTWEAR UNIT DEMAND. SELLING AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES WERE HIGHER THAN FISCAL 2004, BUT REPRESENTED A SLIGHTLY SMALLER PERCENTAGE OF REVENUES DUE TO

OPERATING OVERHEAD LEVERAGE. THE INCREASE IN SELLING AND ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS WAS DUE TO INCREASES IN BOTH DEMAND CREATION AND OPERATING OVERHEAD. THE INCREASE IN DEMAND CREATION WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY INCREASED SPENDING ON SPORTS MARKETING

ENDORSEMENTS AND EVENTS AND INCREASED RETAIL MARKETING SPENDING. THE INCREASE IN OPERATING OVERHEAD SPENDING WAS DRIVEN BY INCREASED SPENDING ON PERSONNEL COSTS AND NEW NIKE-OWNED RETAIL STORES AND HIGHER COSTS RELATED TO SALES AND LEADERSHIP

EVENTS.

FISCAL 2006 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2005

FOR THE EMEA REGION, CHANGES IN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES REDUCED REVENUE GROWTH BY 4 PERCENTAGE POINTS IN FISCAL 2006. EXCLUDING CHANGES IN CURRENCY

EXCHANGE RATES, ALL THREE PRODUCT BUSINESS UNITS GREW. EXCLUDING CURRENCY CHANGES, THE INCREASE IN FOOTWEAR REVENUES REFLECTED INCREASED UNIT SALES PARTIALLY OFFSET BY DECLINES IN THE AVERAGE SELLING PRICE PER PAIR. THE INCREASED UNIT SALES WERE

DRIVEN BY INCREASED DEMAND FOR SPORT CULTURE PRODUCTS. THE DECLINES IN THE AVERAGE SELLING PRICE PER PAIR WERE DUE IN PART TO CHANGES IN THE MIX OF IN-LINE PRODUCTS SOLD TOWARDS PRODUCTS WITH A LOWER AVERAGE SELLING PRICE AND HIGHER SALES INCENTIVES

AS A RESULT OF A DIFFICULT RETAIL ENVIRONMENT IN WESTERN EUROPE. THE INCREASE IN EMEA APPAREL REVENUE WAS DRIVEN BY INCREASED UNIT SALES AND AVERAGE SELLING PRICES OF NIKE BRANDED APPAREL, PRIMARILY INCREASED UNIT SALES OF SPORT PERFORMANCE

PRODUCTS, INCLUDING SOCCER PRODUCTS DRIVEN BY THE WORLD CUP, AND INCREASED AVERAGE SELLING PRICES ACROSS MOST APPAREL CATEGORIES. EXCLUDING CHANGES IN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES, SALES INCREASES IN THE EMERGING MARKETS OF OUR CENTRAL EUROPE, MIDDLE

EAST AND AFRICA UNIT LED THE REVENUE GROWTH, WHILE SALES INCREASES IN WESTERN AND NORTHERN EUROPE ALSO CONTRIBUTED TO THE EMEA SALES GROWTH FOR FISCAL 2006.

THE INCREASE IN PRE-TAX INCOME FOR THE EMEA REGION FOR FISCAL 2006 WAS DRIVEN BY HIGHER REVENUES AND LOWER SELLING AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES AS A PERCENTAGE OF REVENUES MORE THAN OFFSETTING A LOWER GROSS MARGIN

PERCENTAGE AND UNFAVORABLE FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION VERSUS FISCAL 2005. THE LOWER GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE WAS PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF LOWER IN-LINE NET PRICING MARGINS IN FOOTWEAR AND APPAREL, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY IMPROVED YEAR-OVER-YEAR HEDGE

RATES. THE LOWER IN-LINE NET PRICING MARGINS FOR FOOTWEAR WERE DUE TO HIGHER PRODUCT COSTS, PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF HIGHER OIL PRICES, HIGHER SALES INCENTIVES, STRATEGIES TO IMPROVE CONSUMER VALUE, AND A SHIFT IN THE MIX OF PRODUCTS SOLD TOWARDS

PRODUCTS WITH LOWER MARGINS. THE REDUCED IN-LINE NET PRICING MARGINS FOR

TABLE OF CONTENTS

APPAREL WERE PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER PRODUCT COSTS AND HIGHER SALES INCENTIVES. EXCLUDING CHANGES IN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES, SELLING AND ADMINISTRATIVE

EXPENSES IN FISCAL 2006 WERE HIGHER THAN IN FISCAL 2005 BUT REPRESENTED A LOWER PERCENTAGE OF REVENUES DUE TO OPERATING OVERHEAD LEVERAGE. EXCLUDING CURRENCY CHANGES, THE INCREASE IN SELLING AND ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS WAS DRIVEN BY HIGHER DEMAND

CREATION EXPENSES PARTIALLY OFFSET BY SLIGHTLY LOWER OPERATING OVERHEAD EXPENSES. THE HIGHER DEMAND CREATION EXPENSES WERE PRIMARILY DUE TO SPENDING RELATED TO THE WORLD CUP CAMPAIGN AND INCREASED SPENDING ON RETAIL MARKETING PROGRAMS. THE SLIGHTLY

LOWER OPERATING OVERHEAD EXPENSES WERE DUE TO LOWER SPENDING ON TRAVEL AND MEETING EXPENSES, LOWER BAD DEBT EXPENSE AND SLIGHTLY LOWER PERSONNEL COSTS RELATED TO OUR WHOLESALE BUSINESS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY INCREASED SPENDING TO SUPPORT THE GROWTH OF

NIKE-OWNED RETAIL STORES.

FISCAL 2005 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2004

FOR EMEA, CHANGES IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES ACCOUNTED FOR 7 PERCENTAGE POINTS OF THE REPORTED REVENUE GROWTH IN FISCAL 2005. EXCLUDING THE

EFFECTS OF FOREIGN CURRENCY, ALL THREE PRODUCT BUSINESS UNITS GREW. EXCLUDING CURRENCY CHANGES, THE INCREASE OVER THE PRIOR YEAR WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY INCREASED UNIT SALES OF FOOTWEAR, APPAREL AND EQUIPMENT PARTIALLY OFFSET BY DECLINES IN THE

AVERAGE PRICES IN EACH OF THE PRODUCT BUSINESS UNITS. FOR FISCAL 2005, EXCLUDING THE CHANGES IN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES, SALES INCREASES IN THE EMERGING MARKETS IN OUR CENTRAL EUROPE, MIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA UNIT, ALONG WITH SALES INCREASES IN THE UK

AND ITALY, DROVE THE GROWTH. THESE INCREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER SALES IN FRANCE, GERMANY AND NORTHERN EUROPE.

THE INCREASE IN

PRE-TAX INCOME IN THE EMEA REGION IN FISCAL 2005 WAS DRIVEN BY HIGHER REVENUES AND GROSS MARGIN IMPROVEMENTS, MORE THAN OFFSETTING INCREASED SELLING AND ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS AS A PERCENTAGE OF REVENUES. THE IMPROVED GROSS MARGINS WERE PRIMARILY THE

RESULT OF IMPROVED YEAR-OVER-YEAR HEDGE RATES PARTIALLY OFFSET BY REDUCED IN-LINE NET PRICING MARGINS (DUE TO STRATEGIES TO IMPROVE CONSUMER VALUE) AND HIGHER, LESS PROFITABLE CLOSEOUT SALES (THE RESULT OF THE LIQUIDATION OF HIGHER FOOTWEAR AND

APPAREL CLOSEOUT INVENTORIES). THE INCREASE IN SELLING AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES WAS DRIVEN BY INCREASES IN BOTH DEMAND CREATION AND OPERATING OVERHEAD. THE INCREASE IN DEMAND CREATION WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY INCREASED ADVERTISING AND HIGHER

SPENDING ON SPORTS MARKETING ENDORSEMENTS AND EVENTS. THE INCREASE IN OPERATING OVERHEAD SPENDING WAS DRIVEN BY INCREASED SPENDING ON PERSONNEL COSTS TO SUPPORT THE GROWTH OF OUR WHOLESALE BUSINESS AND NEW NIKE-OWNED RETAIL STORES AND HIGHER COSTS

RELATED TO SALES AND LEADERSHIP EVENTS.

IN THE ASIA PACIFIC REGION, CHANGES IN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES REDUCED REVENUE GROWTH BY 1 PERCENTAGE POINT FOR FISCAL 2006. EXCLUDING THE CHANGES IN

CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES, REVENUES FOR EACH ASIA PACIFIC PRODUCT BUSINESS UNIT WERE HIGHER THAN FISCAL 2005. EXCLUDING CHANGES IN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES, FOOTWEAR REVENUES REFLECTED INCREASED UNIT SALES (DRIVEN BY INCREASED UNIT SALES ACROSS MOST

COUNTRIES AND CATEGORIES), PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER AVERAGE SELLING PRICES (DUE TO STRATEGIES TO IMPROVE CONSUMER VALUE IN JAPAN). THE INCREASE IN APPAREL REVENUES WAS DRIVEN BY INCREASES ACROSS SPORT PERFORMANCE AND SPORT CULTURE CATEGORIES.

INCREASED REVENUE IN

TABLE OF CONTENTS

CHINA (DRIVEN BY EXPANSION OF RETAIL DISTRIBUTION AND STRONG CONSUMER DEMAND) WAS THE PRIMARY GROWTH DRIVER FOR FISCAL 2006, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER SALES

IN JAPAN DRIVEN BY LOWER AVERAGE SELLING PRICES DUE TO INVESTMENTS IN CONSUMER VALUE AND A CHALLENGING RETAIL MARKETPLACE.

THE INCREASE IN

FISCAL 2006 PRE-TAX INCOME FOR THE ASIA PACIFIC REGION WAS DRIVEN BY HIGHER REVENUES AND LOWER SELLING AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES AS A PERCENTAGE OF REVENUES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A LOWER GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE. THE LOWER GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE

WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO LOWER IN-LINE NET PRICING MARGINS DUE TO HIGHER FOOTWEAR PRODUCT COSTS, PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF HIGHER OIL PRICES; STRATEGIES TO IMPROVE CONSUMER VALUE FOR FOOTWEAR IN JAPAN; AND A SHIFT IN THE MIX OF FOOTWEAR AND

APPAREL PRODUCTS SOLD IN JAPAN TOWARD PRODUCTS WITH LOWER MARGINS. SELLING AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES IN FISCAL 2006 WERE HIGHER THAN FISCAL 2005, BUT REPRESENTED A LOWER PERCENTAGE OF REVENUES DUE TO OPERATING OVERHEAD LEVERAGE. THE INCREASED

SELLING AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES WERE DUE TO INCREASES IN DEMAND CREATION, PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY SPENDING RELATED TO THE WORLD CUP CAMPAIGN, AND SLIGHTLY HIGHER OPERATING OVERHEAD, PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER PERSONNEL COSTS TO SUPPORT GROWTH IN CHINA.

FISCAL 2005 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2004

IN THE ASIA PACIFIC REGION, 4 PERCENTAGE POINTS OF REPORTED REVENUE GROWTH FOR FISCAL 2005 WERE DUE TO CHANGES IN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES. EXCLUDING CHANGES IN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES, SALES IN EACH ASIA PACIFIC

PRODUCT BUSINESS UNIT GREW VERSUS FISCAL 2004 WITH THE GROWTH PRIMARILY DUE TO UNIT VOLUME; AVERAGE PRICE PER UNIT INCREASED SLIGHTLY. EXCLUDING CURRENCY CHANGES, SIGNIFICANT REVENUE INCREASES IN CHINA (DRIVEN BY EXPANSION OF RETAIL DISTRIBUTION AND

STRONG CONSUMER DEMAND) AND INCREASES IN EVERY OTHER COUNTRY IN THE REGION EXCEPT AUSTRALIA AND NEW ZEALAND WERE THE KEY GROWTH DRIVERS FOR FISCAL 2005.

THE INCREASE IN PRE-TAX INCOME FOR THE ASIA PACIFIC REGION IN FISCAL 2005 WAS DRIVEN BY HIGHER REVENUES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A LOWER GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE AND INCREASED SELLING AND ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS AS A

PERCENTAGE OF REVENUES. THE REDUCED GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO LESS PROFITABLE CLOSEOUT SALES AND LOWER IN-LINE NET PRICING MARGINS DUE TO STRATEGIES TO IMPROVE THE CONSUMER VALUE IN JAPAN, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY BETTER

YEAR-OVER-YEAR CURRENCY HEDGE RATES. THE INCREASE IN SELLING AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES WAS DUE TO INCREASES IN BOTH DEMAND CREATION (DRIVEN BY HIGHER SPENDING ON SPORTS MARKETING ENDORSEMENTS AND EVENTS AND INCREASED SPENDING ON RETAIL MARKETING

PROGRAMS) AND OPERATING OVERHEAD (DRIVEN BY INCREASED SPENDING ON PERSONNEL COSTS TO SUPPORT THE GROWTH OF OUR BUSINESS AND HIGHER COSTS RELATED TO SALES AND LEADERSHIP EVENTS).

CHANGES IN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES, SALES IN EACH AMERICAS PRODUCT BUSINESS UNIT GREW IN FISCAL 2006. THE REVENUE GROWTH WAS DRIVEN BY INCREASED SALES IN EVERY COUNTRY IN THE REGION, WITH SIGNIFICANT SALES INCREASES IN BRAZIL, ARGENTINA AND MEXICO.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE INCREASE IN FISCAL 2006 PRE-TAX INCOME FOR THE AMERICAS REGION WAS ATTRIBUTABLE TO HIGHER REVENUES,

AN IMPROVED GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE, LOWER SELLING AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES AS A PERCENTAGE OF REVENUES AND FAVORABLE CURRENCY TRANSLATION. SELLING AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES WERE HIGHER THAN FISCAL 2005, BUT REPRESENTED A LOWER PERCENTAGE OF

REVENUES FOR FISCAL 2006. THE INCREASED SELLING AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES WERE DUE TO INCREASES IN BOTH DEMAND CREATION (DUE TO INCREASED SPORTS MARKETING ENDORSEMENT CONTRACTS, AND INCREASED ADVERTISING SPENDING AND RETAIL MARKETING PROGRAMS

PRIMARILY RELATED TO THE WORLD CUP CAMPAIGN) AND OPERATING OVERHEAD (DRIVEN BY INCREASED PERSONNEL COSTS AS A RESULT OF CONTINUED EXPANSION OF THE BUSINESS ACROSS THE REGION).

FISCAL 2005 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2004

IN THE AMERICAS REGION, 1 PERCENTAGE POINT OF THE REVENUE GROWTH FOR FISCAL 2005 WAS DUE TO CHANGES IN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES. EXCLUDING THE EFFECTS OF CHANGES IN FOREIGN CURRENCY, SALES IN EACH AMERICAS PRODUCT BUSINESS UNIT GREW IN

FISCAL 2005. THE REVENUE GROWTH WAS DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY HIGHER SALES IN CENTRAL AND SOUTH AMERICA, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER SALES IN CANADA.

THE INCREASE IN FISCAL 2005 PRE-TAX INCOME FOR THE AMERICAS REGION WAS ATTRIBUTABLE TO HIGHER REVENUES AND AN IMPROVED GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER SELLING AND ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS AS A PERCENTAGE OF REVENUES. THE

INCREASED SELLING AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES WERE DUE TO INCREASES IN BOTH DEMAND CREATION (DUE TO INCREASED SPENDING ON SPORTS MARKETING ENDORSEMENT CONTRACT AND EVENTS, ADVERTISING AND RETAIL MARKETING PROGRAMS) AND OPERATING OVERHEAD (DRIVEN BY

INCREASED PERSONNEL COSTS).

FISCAL 2006 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2005

REVENUE INCREASES FOR OUR OTHER BUSINESSES IN FISCAL 2006 AS COMPARED TO FISCAL 2005 WERE DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY GROWTH AT COLE HAAN, CONVERSE, HURLEY AND

NIKE GOLF.

PRE-TAX INCOME FROM THE OTHER BUSINESSES FOR FISCAL 2006 WAS CONSISTENT WITH FISCAL 2005 AND INCLUDED A $51.9 MILLION CHARGE

RELATED TO THE UNFAVORABLE ARBITRATION RULING INVOLVING A LICENSING AGREEMENT CONTRACT DISPUTE WITH OUR CONVERSE SUBSIDIARY AND A FORMER SOUTH AMERICAN LICENSEE. THIS CHARGE REDUCED REPORTED PRE-TAX INCOME FOR THE OTHER BUSINESSES BY 34 PERCENTAGE

POINTS. EXCLUDING THE CONVERSE ARBITRATION CHARGE, THE PRE-TAX INCOME IMPROVEMENT WAS DRIVEN BY IMPROVED PROFITABILITY AT CONVERSE, HURLEY AND NIKE GOLF, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A LOSS AT NIKE BAUER HOCKEY. THE LOSS AT NIKE BAUER HOCKEY WAS LARGELY THE

RESULT OF COSTS INCURRED IN CONNECTION WITH A RE-BRANDING INITIATIVE.

LLC (COLLECTIVELY OFFICIAL STARTER), TOGETHER DROVE 12 PERCENTAGE POINTS OF THE OTHER BUSINESS REVENUE INCREASE OF 22% OVER FISCAL 2004. THE REMAINDER OF THE INCREASE WAS DRIVEN BY REVENUE GROWTH AT COLE HAAN, HURLEY AND NIKE GOLF.

THE YEAR-OVER-YEAR IMPROVEMENT IN FISCAL 2005 PRE-TAX INCOME FROM THE OTHER BUSINESSES WAS DRIVEN BY THE ADDITION OF CONVERSE, IMPROVED

RESULTS FROM COLE HAAN AND NIKE BAUER HOCKEY AND THE FORMATION OF THE EXETER BRANDS GROUP.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

FISCAL 2006 CASH FLOW ACTIVITY

CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATIONS WAS $1.7 BILLION IN FISCAL 2006, COMPARED TO $1.6 BILLION IN FISCAL 2005. OUR PRIMARY SOURCE OF OPERATING CASH FLOW WAS NET INCOME OF $1.4 BILLION. FOR FISCAL 2006, OUR NET INVESTMENT IN WORKING CAPITAL INCREASED

$43.2 MILLION AS COMPARED TO AN INCREASE OF $13.0 MILLION IN FISCAL 2005. THIS INCREASED INVESTMENT IN WORKING CAPITAL WAS LARGELY ATTRIBUTABLE TO A LARGER INCREASE IN INVENTORIES AND PREPAID EXPENSES AND OTHER CURRENT ASSETS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY

INCREASES IN ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND ACCRUED LIABILITIES. THE INCREASE IN INVENTORIES REFLECTS HIGHER IN-TRANSIT INVENTORIES (DUE PRIMARILY TO GROWTH IN REPORTED FUTURES AND OTHER ORDERS, AND EARLIER PRODUCT ORDERING COMPARED TO LAST YEAR) AND HIGHER

INVENTORIES TO SUPPORT THE EXPANSION OF NIKE-OWNED RETAIL STORES. PREPAID EXPENSES AND OTHER CURRENT ASSETS INCREASED IN FISCAL 2006 COMPARED TO A DECREASE IN THE PRIOR YEAR, PRIMARILY DUE TO THE TIMING OF PAYMENTS, INCLUDING EARLIER PAYMENTS OF

INCOME TAXES IN CERTAIN FOREIGN LOCATIONS. THE INCREASE IN ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND ACCRUED LIABILITIES IS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE TIMING OF PAYMENTS AND INVENTORY RECEIPTS COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR.

CASH USED BY INVESTING ACTIVITIES DURING FISCAL 2006 WAS $1.3 BILLION, COMPARED TO $360.4 MILLION INVESTED DURING FISCAL 2005. THE INCREASE OVER THE

PRIOR YEAR WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO A HIGHER NET INCREASE IN SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS (PURCHASES NET OF MATURITIES), WHICH INCREASED FROM $35.3 MILLION IN FISCAL 2005 TO $909.9 MILLION IN FISCAL 2006, AND INCREASED NET ADDITIONS TO PROPERTY, PLANT AND

EQUIPMENT. THE ADDITIONS TO PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT PRIMARILY REFLECT CAPITAL EXPENDITURES ON COMPUTER EQUIPMENT AND SOFTWARE (TO SUPPORT BOTH NORMAL BUSINESS OPERATIONS AND OUR SUPPLY CHAIN SYSTEMS UPGRADE), AND CONTINUED INVESTMENT IN

NIKE-OWNED RETAIL STORES.

IN FISCAL 2006, WE PURCHASED APPROXIMATELY 9.5 MILLION SHARES OF NIKES CLASS B COMMON STOCK FOR

$781.2 MILLION. THE SHARE REPURCHASES WERE PART OF A FOUR-YEAR, $1.5 BILLION SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM THAT WAS APPROVED BY THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS IN JUNE 2004. SINCE THE INCEPTION OF THIS PROGRAM, WE HAVE REPURCHASED 16.4 MILLION SHARES, AT A

TOTAL COST OF $1.3 BILLION. IN JUNE 2006, THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS APPROVED A NEW FOUR-YEAR, $3.0 BILLION SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM, TO COMMENCE UPON COMPLETION OF THE $1.5 BILLION SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM. WE EXPECT TO FUND SHARE REPURCHASES FROM

OPERATING CASH FLOW, EXCESS CASH, AND/OR DEBT. THE TIMING AND THE ULTIMATE AMOUNT OF SHARES PURCHASED UNDER THE PROGRAMS WILL BE DICTATED BY OUR CAPITAL NEEDS AND STOCK MARKET CONDITIONS.

DIVIDENDS DECLARED PER SHARE OF COMMON STOCK FOR FISCAL 2006 WERE $1.18, COMPARED TO $0.95 IN FISCAL 2005. WE HAVE PAID A DIVIDEND EVERY QUARTER SINCE

FEBRUARY 1984. OUR CURRENT DIVIDEND POLICY IS TO PROVIDE AN ANNUAL DIVIDEND EQUAL TO 20% TO 30% OF THE TRAILING TWELVE-MONTHS EARNINGS PER SHARE, PAID OUT ON A QUARTERLY BASIS. WE REVIEW OUR DIVIDEND POLICY FROM TIME TO TIME, AND BASED UPON

CURRENT PROJECTED EARNINGS AND CASH FLOW REQUIREMENTS, WE ANTICIPATE CONTINUING TO PAY A QUARTERLY DIVIDEND IN THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE.

THE AMOUNTS LISTED FOR ENDORSEMENT CONTRACTS REPRESENT APPROXIMATE AMOUNTS OF BASE COMPENSATION AND MINIMUM GUARANTEED ROYALTY FEES WE ARE OBLIGATED TO PAY ATHLETE

AND SPORT TEAM ENDORSERS OF OUR PRODUCTS. ACTUAL PAYMENTS UNDER SOME CONTRACTS MAY BE HIGHER THAN THE AMOUNTS LISTED AS THESE CONTRACTS PROVIDE FOR BONUSES TO BE PAID TO THE ENDORSERS BASED UPON ATHLETIC ACHIEVEMENTS AND/OR ROYALTIES ON PRODUCT

SALES IN FUTURE PERIODS. ACTUAL PAYMENTS UNDER SOME CONTRACTS MAY ALSO BE LOWER AS THESE CONTRACTS INCLUDE PROVISIONS FOR REDUCED PAYMENTS IF ATHLETIC PERFORMANCE DECLINES IN FUTURE PERIODS.

IN ADDITION TO THE CASH PAYMENTS, WE ARE OBLIGATED TO FURNISH THE ENDORSERS WITH NIKE PRODUCTS FOR THEIR USE. IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO DETERMINE HOW MUCH WE WILL SPEND ON THIS PRODUCT

ON AN ANNUAL BASIS AS THE CONTRACTS DO NOT STIPULATE A SPECIFIC AMOUNT OF CASH TO BE SPENT ON THE PRODUCT. THE AMOUNT OF PRODUCT PROVIDED TO THE ENDORSERS WILL DEPEND ON MANY FACTORS INCLUDING GENERAL PLAYING CONDITIONS, THE NUMBER OF SPORTING

EVENTS IN WHICH THEY PARTICIPATE, AND OUR OWN DECISIONS REGARDING PRODUCT AND MARKETING INITIATIVES. IN ADDITION, THE COSTS TO DESIGN, DEVELOP, SOURCE, AND PURCHASE THE PRODUCTS FURNISHED TO THE ENDORSERS ARE INCURRED OVER A PERIOD OF TIME AND ARE

NOT NECESSARILY TRACKED SEPARATELY FROM SIMILAR COSTS INCURRED FOR PRODUCTS SOLD TO CUSTOMERS.

CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET AS OF MAY 31, 2006.

EXCLUDED FROM THE TABLE ABOVE IS A COMMITMENT TO AN OUTSOURCING

CONTRACTOR THAT PROVIDES US WITH INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT SERVICES THROUGH FISCAL 2008. THE AMOUNT OF THE PAYMENTS IN FUTURE YEARS DEPENDS ON OUR LEVEL OF MONTHLY USE OF THE DIFFERENT ELEMENTS OF THE CONTRACTORS SERVICES.

IF WE WERE TO TERMINATE THE ENTIRE CONTRACT AS OF MAY 31, 2006, WE WOULD BE REQUIRED TO PROVIDE THE CONTRACTOR WITH FOUR MONTHS NOTICE AND PAY A TERMINATION FEE OF $18.7 MILLION. OUR MONTHLY PAYMENTS TO THE CONTRACTOR CURRENTLY

CAPITAL RESOURCES

IN OCTOBER 2001, WE FILED A SHELF REGISTRATION STATEMENT WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (SEC) UNDER WHICH $1 BILLION IN DEBT

SECURITIES MAY BE ISSUED. IN MAY 2002, WE COMMENCED A MEDIUM-TERM NOTE PROGRAM UNDER THE SHELF REGISTRATION THAT ALLOWS US TO ISSUE UP TO $500 MILLION IN MEDIUM-TERM NOTES, AS OUR CAPITAL NEEDS DICTATE. WE ENTERED INTO THIS PROGRAM TO PROVIDE

ADDITIONAL LIQUIDITY TO MEET OUR WORKING CAPITAL AND GENERAL CORPORATE CASH REQUIREMENTS AND SINCE COMMENCEMENT OF THE MEDIUM-TERM NOTE PROGRAM WE HAVE ISSUED $240.0 MILLION IN MEDIUM-TERM NOTES. DURING FISCAL 2006, THERE WERE NO MEDIUM-TERM NOTES

ISSUED UNDER THE PROGRAM. WE MAY ISSUE ADDITIONAL NOTES UNDER THE SHELF REGISTRATION IN FISCAL 2007 DEPENDING ON GENERAL CORPORATE NEEDS.

AS OF MAY 31, 2006, WE HAD A MULTI-YEAR $750 MILLION REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY IN PLACE WITH A GROUP OF BANKS, AND WE CURRENTLY HAVE NO AMOUNTS OUTSTANDING UNDER THE FACILITY. THE MATURITY DATE IS NOVEMBER 20, 2008 AND THE

FACILITY CAN BE EXTENDED FOR ONE ADDITIONAL YEAR ON THE ANNIVERSARY DATE. BASED ON OUR CURRENT LONG-TERM SENIOR UNSECURED DEBT RATINGS OF A+ AND A2 FROM STANDARD AND POORS CORPORATION AND MOODYS INVESTOR SERVICES, RESPECTIVELY, THE

INTEREST RATE CHARGED ON ANY OUTSTANDING BORROWINGS WOULD BE THE PREVAILING LIBOR PLUS 0.18%. THE FACILITY FEE IS 0.07% OF THE TOTAL COMMITMENT.

IF OUR LONG-TERM DEBT RATING WERE TO DECLINE, THE FACILITY FEE AND INTEREST RATE UNDER OUR COMMITTED CREDIT FACILITY WOULD INCREASE. CONVERSELY, IF OUR LONG-TERM DEBT RATING WERE TO IMPROVE, THE FACILITY FEE AND INTEREST RATE WOULD

DECREASE. CHANGES IN OUR LONG-TERM DEBT RATING WOULD NOT TRIGGER ACCELERATION OF MATURITY OF ANY THEN OUTSTANDING BORROWINGS OR ANY FUTURE BORROWINGS UNDER THE COMMITTED CREDIT FACILITIES. UNDER THIS COMMITTED CREDIT FACILITY, WE HAVE AGREED TO

VARIOUS COVENANTS. THESE COVENANTS INCLUDE LIMITS ON OUR DISPOSAL OF FIXED ASSETS AND THE AMOUNT OF DEBT SECURED BY LIENS WE MAY INCUR, AND SET A MINIMUM CAPITALIZATION RATIO. IN THE EVENT WE WERE TO HAVE ANY BORROWINGS OUTSTANDING UNDER THIS

FACILITY, FAILED TO MEET ANY COVENANT, AND WERE UNABLE TO OBTAIN A WAIVER FROM A MAJORITY OF THE BANKS, ANY BORROWINGS WOULD BECOME IMMEDIATELY DUE AND PAYABLE. AS OF MAY 31, 2006, WE WERE IN FULL COMPLIANCE WITH EACH OF THESE COVENANTS AND

BELIEVE IT IS UNLIKELY WE WILL FAIL TO MEET ANY OF THESE COVENANTS IN THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE.

LIQUIDITY IS ALSO PROVIDED BY OUR COMMERCIAL

PAPER PROGRAM, UNDER WHICH THERE WAS NO AMOUNT OUTSTANDING AT MAY 31, 2006 OR MAY 31, 2005. WE CURRENTLY HAVE SHORT-TERM DEBT RATINGS OF A1 AND P1 FROM STANDARD AND POORS CORPORATION AND MOODYS INVESTOR SERVICES, RESPECTIVELY.

WE CURRENTLY BELIEVE THAT CASH GENERATED BY OPERATIONS, TOGETHER WITH ACCESS TO EXTERNAL SOURCES OF FUNDS AS DESCRIBED ABOVE, WILL BE

SUFFICIENT TO MEET OUR OPERATING AND CAPITAL NEEDS IN THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE.

RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

IN NOVEMBER 2004, THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD (FASB) ISSUED STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS (SFAS)

NO. 151, INVENTORY COSTS, AN AMENDMENT OF ARB NO. 43, CHAPTER 4

34

TABLE OF CONTENTS

(FAS 151). FAS 151 CLARIFIES THAT ABNORMAL INVENTORY COSTS SUCH AS COSTS OF IDLE FACILITIES, EXCESS FREIGHT AND HANDLING COSTS, AND WASTED

MATERIALS (SPOILAGE) ARE REQUIRED TO BE RECOGNIZED AS CURRENT PERIOD CHARGES. THE PROVISIONS OF FAS 151 ARE EFFECTIVE FOR OUR FISCAL YEAR BEGINNING JUNE 1, 2006. WE HAVE EVALUATED THE PROVISIONS OF FAS 151 AND DO NOT EXPECT THAT THE ADOPTION

WILL HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL POSITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

ON DECEMBER 16, 2004, THE FASB FINALIZED

SFAS NO. 123R SHARE BASED PAYMENT, (FAS 123R) WHICH, AFTER THE SEC AMENDED THE COMPLIANCE DATES ON APRIL 15, 2005, IS EFFECTIVE FOR OUR FISCAL YEAR BEGINNING JUNE 1, 2006. THE NEW STANDARD WILL REQUIRE US TO

RECORD COMPENSATION EXPENSE FOR STOCK OPTIONS USING A FAIR VALUE METHOD. ON MARCH 29, 2005, THE SEC ISSUED STAFF ACCOUNTING BULLETIN NO. 107 (SAB 107), WHICH PROVIDES THE STAFFS VIEWS REGARDING INTERACTIONS BETWEEN FAS

123R AND CERTAIN SEC RULES AND REGULATIONS AND PROVIDES INTERPRETATIONS OF THE VALUATION OF SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS FOR PUBLIC COMPANIES.

WE

PLAN TO ADOPT THE NEW REQUIREMENTS UNDER FAS 123R AND SAB 107 BEGINNING IN OUR FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2007 USING THE MODIFIED PROSPECTIVE TRANSITION METHOD AND THE BLACK-SCHOLES FAIR VALUE MODEL. AS A RESULT OF THE ADOPTION OF FAS 123R, WE WILL

RECOGNIZE ADDITIONAL COMPENSATION EXPENSE OF APPROXIMATELY $0.36 PER DILUTED SHARE IN FISCAL 2007. THE AMOUNT OF EXPENSE THAT WILL BE RECOGNIZED IS LARGELY DEPENDENT ON SEVERAL VARIABLES, INCLUDING THE LEVEL OF SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS THAT WILL BE

GRANTED DURING THE FISCAL YEAR IN ADDITION TO THE ASSUMPTIONS USED IN THE VALUATION MODEL. ACCORDINGLY, THE ACTUAL EFFECT PER DILUTED SHARE COULD DIFFER FROM THIS ESTIMATE. THE EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OF EXPENSING STOCK OPTIONS FOR

FISCAL 2006, 2005 AND 2004 USING THE BLACK-SCHOLES MODEL IS PRESENTED IN THE ACCOMPANYING

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (NOTE 1  SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES).

UNDER CERTAIN CONDITIONS, STOCK OPTIONS GRANTED BY THE COMPANY ARE ELIGIBLE FOR ACCELERATED VESTING UPON THE RETIREMENT OF THE EMPLOYEE. THE FASB

CLARIFIED IN FAS 123R THAT THE FAIR VALUE OF SUCH STOCK OPTIONS SHOULD BE EXPENSED BASED ON THE APPLICABLE ACCELERATED VESTING SCHEDULE, RATHER THAN RATABLY OVER THE VESTING PERIOD STATED IN THE GRANT. OUR PRO FORMA DISCLOSURE CURRENTLY REFLECTS THE

EXPENSE OF SUCH OPTIONS RATABLY OVER THE STATED VESTING PERIOD, EXPENSING ALL UNVESTED SHARES UPON ACTUAL RETIREMENT. THE SEC CLARIFIED THAT COMPANIES SHOULD CONTINUE TO FOLLOW THE VESTING METHOD THEY HAVE BEEN USING UNTIL ADOPTION OF FAS 123R, THEN

APPLY THE ACCELERATED VESTING SCHEDULE TO ALL SUBSEQUENT GRANTS TO THOSE EMPLOYEES ELIGIBLE FOR ACCELERATED VESTING UPON RETIREMENT. HAD WE BEEN ACCOUNTING FOR SUCH STOCK OPTIONS USING THE ACCELERATED VESTING SCHEDULE FOR THOSE EMPLOYEES ELIGIBLE

FOR ACCELERATED VESTING UPON RETIREMENT, WE WOULD HAVE RECOGNIZED ADDITIONAL STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE IN OUR PRO FORMA DISCLOSURE OF THE EFFECT OF EXPENSING STOCK OPTIONS PRESENTED IN THE ACCOMPANYING

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS (NOTE 1  SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES)

OF $0.01 PER DILUTED SHARE IN FISCAL 2006 AND $0.05 PER DILUTED SHARE IN FISCAL 2005 AND 2004. WE USUALLY GRANT THE MAJORITY OF STOCK OPTIONS IN A SINGLE GRANT IN THE FIRST THREE MONTHS

OF EACH FISCAL YEAR. AS A RESULT, ACCELERATED VESTING WILL NORMALLY RESULT IN HIGHER EXPENSE IN THE FIRST THREE MONTHS AND LOWER EXPENSE IN THE LAST NINE MONTHS OF EACH FISCAL YEAR, AS COMPARED TO THE PRO FORMA EXPENSE WE DISCLOSED UNDER OUR CURRENT

POLICY OF EXPENSING SUCH OPTIONS RATABLY OVER THE STATED VESTING PERIOD.

IN JUNE 2006, THE FASB ISSUED FASB INTERPRETATION NO. 48,

ACCOUNTING FOR UNCERTAINTY IN INCOME TAXES (FIN 48). FIN 48 CLARIFIES THE ACCOUNTING FOR UNCERTAINTY IN INCOME TAXES RECOGNIZED IN OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH FASB STATEMENT NO. 109, ACCOUNTING FOR

INCOME TAXES. THE PROVISIONS OF FIN 48 ARE EFFECTIVE FOR OUR FISCAL YEAR BEGINNING JUNE 1, 2007. WE ARE CURRENTLY EVALUATING THE IMPACT OF THE PROVISIONS OF FIN 48.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS ARE BASED UPON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, WHICH HAVE BEEN PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. THE PREPARATION OF THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS REQUIRES

US TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS THAT AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS, LIABILITIES, REVENUES AND EXPENSES, AND RELATED DISCLOSURE OF CONTINGENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES.

35

TABLE OF CONTENTS

WE BELIEVE THAT THE ESTIMATES, ASSUMPTIONS AND JUDGMENTS INVOLVED IN THE ACCOUNTING POLICIES DESCRIBED

BELOW HAVE THE GREATEST POTENTIAL IMPACT ON OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, SO WE CONSIDER THESE TO BE OUR CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES. BECAUSE OF THE UNCERTAINTY INHERENT IN THESE MATTERS, ACTUAL RESULTS COULD DIFFER FROM THE ESTIMATES WE USE IN

APPLYING THE CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES. CERTAIN OF THESE CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AFFECT WORKING CAPITAL ACCOUNT BALANCES, INCLUDING THE POLICIES FOR REVENUE RECOGNITION, THE RESERVE FOR UNCOLLECTIBLE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, INVENTORY RESERVES,

AND CONTINGENT PAYMENTS UNDER ENDORSEMENT CONTRACTS. THESE POLICIES REQUIRE THAT WE MAKE ESTIMATES IN THE PREPARATION OF OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AS OF A GIVEN DATE. HOWEVER, SINCE OUR BUSINESS CYCLE IS RELATIVELY SHORT, ACTUAL RESULTS RELATED TO

THESE ESTIMATES ARE GENERALLY KNOWN WITHIN THE SIX-MONTH PERIOD FOLLOWING THE FINANCIAL STATEMENT DATE. THUS, THESE POLICIES GENERALLY AFFECT ONLY THE TIMING OF REPORTED AMOUNTS ACROSS TWO TO THREE FISCAL QUARTERS.

WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF THESE CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES, WE ARE NOT CURRENTLY AWARE OF ANY REASONABLY LIKELY EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES THAT WOULD RESULT

IN MATERIALLY DIFFERENT AMOUNTS BEING REPORTED.

REVENUE RECOGNITION

WE RECORD WHOLESALE REVENUES WHEN TITLE PASSES AND THE RISKS AND REWARDS OF OWNERSHIP HAVE PASSED TO THE CUSTOMER, BASED ON THE TERMS OF SALE. TITLE

PASSES GENERALLY UPON SHIPMENT OR UPON RECEIPT BY THE CUSTOMER DEPENDING ON THE COUNTRY OF THE SALE AND THE AGREEMENT WITH THE CUSTOMER. RETAIL STORE REVENUES ARE RECORDED AT THE TIME OF SALE.

IN SOME INSTANCES, WE SHIP PRODUCT DIRECTLY FROM OUR SUPPLIER TO THE CUSTOMER AND RECOGNIZE REVENUE WHEN THE PRODUCT IS DELIVERED TO AND ACCEPTED BY THE

CUSTOMER. OUR REVENUES MAY FLUCTUATE IN CASES WHEN OUR CUSTOMERS DELAY ACCEPTING SHIPMENT OF PRODUCT FOR PERIODS UP TO SEVERAL WEEKS.

IN

CERTAIN COUNTRIES OUTSIDE OF THE U.S., PRECISE INFORMATION REGARDING THE DATE OF RECEIPT BY THE CUSTOMER IS NOT READILY AVAILABLE. IN THESE CASES, WE ESTIMATE THE DATE OF RECEIPT BY THE CUSTOMER BASED UPON HISTORICAL DELIVERY TIMES BY GEOGRAPHIC

LOCATION. ON THE BASIS OF OUR TESTS OF ACTUAL TRANSACTIONS, WE HAVE NO INDICATION THAT THESE ESTIMATES HAVE BEEN MATERIALLY INACCURATE HISTORICALLY.

AS PART OF OUR REVENUE RECOGNITION POLICY, WE RECORD ESTIMATED SALES RETURNS AND MISCELLANEOUS CLAIMS FROM CUSTOMERS AS REDUCTIONS TO REVENUES AT THE TIME REVENUES ARE RECORDED. WE BASE OUR ESTIMATES ON HISTORICAL

RATES OF PRODUCT RETURNS AND CLAIMS, AND SPECIFIC IDENTIFICATION OF OUTSTANDING CLAIMS AND OUTSTANDING RETURNS NOT YET RECEIVED FROM CUSTOMERS. ACTUAL RETURNS AND CLAIMS IN ANY FUTURE PERIOD ARE INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN AND THUS MAY DIFFER FROM OUR

ESTIMATES. IF ACTUAL OR EXPECTED FUTURE RETURNS AND CLAIMS WERE SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER OR LOWER THAN THE RESERVES WE HAD ESTABLISHED, WE WOULD RECORD A REDUCTION OR INCREASE TO NET REVENUES IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH WE MADE SUCH DETERMINATION.

RESERVE FOR UNCOLLECTIBLE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE

WE MAKE ONGOING ESTIMATES RELATING TO THE COLLECTIBILITY OF OUR ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND MAINTAIN A RESERVE FOR ESTIMATED LOSSES RESULTING FROM THE INABILITY OF OUR CUSTOMERS TO MAKE REQUIRED PAYMENTS. IN DETERMINING

THE AMOUNT OF THE RESERVE, WE CONSIDER OUR HISTORICAL LEVEL OF CREDIT LOSSES AND MAKE JUDGMENTS ABOUT THE CREDITWORTHINESS OF SIGNIFICANT CUSTOMERS BASED ON ONGOING CREDIT EVALUATIONS. SINCE WE CANNOT PREDICT FUTURE CHANGES IN THE FINANCIAL

STABILITY OF OUR CUSTOMERS, ACTUAL FUTURE LOSSES FROM UNCOLLECTIBLE ACCOUNTS MAY DIFFER FROM OUR ESTIMATES. IF THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF OUR CUSTOMERS WERE TO DETERIORATE, RESULTING IN THEIR INABILITY TO MAKE PAYMENTS, A LARGER RESERVE MIGHT BE

REQUIRED. IN THE EVENT WE DETERMINED THAT A SMALLER OR LARGER RESERVE WAS APPROPRIATE, WE WOULD RECORD A CREDIT OR A CHARGE TO SELLING AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH WE MADE SUCH A DETERMINATION.

INVENTORY RESERVES

WE ALSO

MAKE ONGOING ESTIMATES RELATING TO THE NET REALIZABLE VALUE OF INVENTORIES, BASED UPON OUR ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT FUTURE DEMAND AND MARKET CONDITIONS. IF WE ESTIMATE THAT THE NET REALIZABLE VALUE OF OUR

36

TABLE OF CONTENTS

INVENTORY IS LESS THAN THE COST OF THE INVENTORY RECORDED ON OUR BOOKS, WE RECORD A RESERVE EQUAL TO THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE COST OF THE INVENTORY AND THE

ESTIMATED NET REALIZABLE VALUE. THIS RESERVE IS RECORDED AS A CHARGE TO COST OF SALES. IF CHANGES IN MARKET CONDITIONS RESULT IN REDUCTIONS IN THE ESTIMATED NET REALIZABLE VALUE OF OUR INVENTORY BELOW OUR PREVIOUS ESTIMATE, WE WOULD INCREASE OUR

RESERVE IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH WE MADE SUCH A DETERMINATION AND RECORD A CHARGE TO COST OF SALES.

CONTINGENT PAYMENTS UNDER

ENDORSEMENT CONTRACTS

A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR DEMAND CREATION EXPENSE RELATES TO PAYMENTS UNDER ENDORSEMENT CONTRACTS. IN

GENERAL, ENDORSEMENT PAYMENTS ARE EXPENSED UNIFORMLY OVER THE TERM OF THE CONTRACT. HOWEVER, CERTAIN CONTRACT ELEMENTS MAY BE ACCOUNTED FOR DIFFERENTLY, BASED UPON THE FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES OF EACH INDIVIDUAL CONTRACT.

SOME OF THE CONTRACTS PROVIDE FOR CONTINGENT PAYMENTS TO ENDORSERS BASED UPON SPECIFIC ACHIEVEMENTS IN THEIR SPORTS (E.G., WINNING A CHAMPIONSHIP). WE

RECORD SELLING AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE FOR THESE AMOUNTS WHEN THE ENDORSER ACHIEVES THE SPECIFIC GOAL.

SOME OF THE CONTRACTS PROVIDE

FOR PAYMENTS BASED UPON ENDORSERS MAINTAINING A LEVEL OF PERFORMANCE IN THEIR SPORT OVER AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF TIME (E.G., MAINTAINING A TOP RANKING IN A SPORT FOR A YEAR). THESE AMOUNTS ARE REPORTED IN SELLING AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE WHEN WE

DETERMINE THAT IT IS PROBABLE THAT THE SPECIFIED LEVEL OF PERFORMANCE WILL BE MAINTAINED THROUGHOUT THE PERIOD. IN THESE INSTANCES, TO THE EXTENT THAT ACTUAL PAYMENTS TO THE ENDORSER DIFFER FROM OUR ESTIMATE DUE TO CHANGES IN THE ENDORSERS

ATHLETIC PERFORMANCE, INCREASED OR DECREASED SELLING AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE MAY BE REPORTED IN A FUTURE PERIOD.

SOME OF THE CONTRACTS

PROVIDE FOR ROYALTY PAYMENTS TO ENDORSERS BASED UPON A PREDETERMINED PERCENTAGE OF SALES OF PARTICULAR PRODUCTS. WE EXPENSE THESE PAYMENTS IN COST OF SALES AS THE RELATED SALES ARE MADE. IN CERTAIN CONTRACTS, WE OFFER MINIMUM GUARANTEED ROYALTY

PAYMENTS. FOR CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS FOR WHICH WE ESTIMATE THAT WE WILL NOT MEET THE MINIMUM GUARANTEED AMOUNT OF ROYALTY FEES THROUGH SALES OF PRODUCT, WE RECORD THE AMOUNT OF THE GUARANTEED PAYMENT IN EXCESS OF THAT EARNED THROUGH SALES OF

PRODUCT IN SELLING AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE UNIFORMLY OVER THE REMAINING GUARANTEE PERIOD.

PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT

PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT, INCLUDING BUILDINGS, EQUIPMENT, AND COMPUTER HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE IS RECORDED AT COST (INCLUDING,

IN SOME CASES, THE COST OF INTERNAL LABOR) AND IS DEPRECIATED OVER ITS ESTIMATED USEFUL LIFE. CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES (SUCH AS TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES OR CHANGES TO OUR BUSINESS OPERATIONS) CAN RESULT IN DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE ACTUAL AND ESTIMATED

USEFUL LIVES. IN THOSE CASES WHERE WE DETERMINE THAT THE USEFUL LIFE OF A LONG-LIVED ASSET SHOULD BE SHORTENED, WE INCREASE DEPRECIATION EXPENSE OVER THE REMAINING USEFUL LIFE TO DEPRECIATE THE ASSETS NET BOOK VALUE TO ITS SALVAGE VALUE.

WHEN EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THAT THE CARRYING VALUE OF PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT MAY BE IMPAIRED, WE ESTIMATE THE FUTURE

UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS TO BE DERIVED FROM THE ASSET TO DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT A POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT EXISTS. IF THE CARRYING VALUE EXCEEDS OUR ESTIMATE OF FUTURE UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS, WE THEN CALCULATE THE IMPAIRMENT AS THE EXCESS OF THE

CARRYING VALUE OF THE ASSET OVER OUR ESTIMATE OF ITS FAIR MARKET VALUE. ANY IMPAIRMENT CHARGES ARE RECORDED AS OTHER EXPENSE, NET. WE ESTIMATE FUTURE UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS USING ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT OUR EXPECTED FUTURE OPERATING PERFORMANCE. OUR

ESTIMATES OF UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS MAY CHANGE IN FUTURE PERIODS DUE TO, AMONG OTHER THINGS, TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGES, ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, CHANGES TO OUR BUSINESS OPERATIONS OR INABILITY TO MEET BUSINESS PLANS. SUCH CHANGES MAY RESULT IN IMPAIRMENT

CHARGES IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH SUCH CHANGES IN ESTIMATES ARE MADE.

GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS

IN ACCORDANCE WITH SFAS NO. 142, GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS (FAS 142), GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS WITH

INDEFINITE LIVES ARE NOT AMORTIZED BUT INSTEAD MEASURED FOR IMPAIRMENT AT LEAST ANNUALLY IN

37

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE FOURTH FISCAL QUARTER, OR WHEN EVENTS INDICATE THAT AN IMPAIRMENT EXISTS. AS REQUIRED BY FAS 142, IN OUR IMPAIRMENT TESTS FOR GOODWILL AND OTHER

INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS, WE COMPARE THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS TO THE CARRYING VALUE. IF THE CARRYING VALUE EXCEEDS OUR ESTIMATE OF FAIR VALUE, WE CALCULATE IMPAIRMENT AS THE EXCESS OF THE CARRYING

VALUE OVER OUR ESTIMATE OF FAIR VALUE. OUR ESTIMATES OF FAIR VALUE UTILIZED IN GOODWILL AND OTHER INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSET TESTS MAY BE BASED UPON A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING OUR ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT THE EXPECTED FUTURE OPERATING

PERFORMANCE OF OUR REPORTING UNITS. OUR ESTIMATES MAY CHANGE IN FUTURE PERIODS DUE TO, AMONG OTHER THINGS, TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE, ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, CHANGES TO OUR BUSINESS OPERATIONS OR INABILITY TO MEET BUSINESS PLANS. SUCH CHANGES MAY RESULT IN

IMPAIRMENT CHARGES RECORDED IN FUTURE PERIODS. ANY IMPAIRMENT CHARGE RELATED TO GOODWILL WOULD BE CLASSIFIED AS A SEPARATE LINE ITEM ON OUR CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF INCOME AS PART OF INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES AND ANY IMPAIRMENT CHARGE RELATED TO

OTHER INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS WOULD BE CLASSIFIED AS OTHER EXPENSE, NET.

INTANGIBLE ASSETS THAT ARE DETERMINED TO HAVE DEFINITE

LIVES ARE AMORTIZED OVER THEIR USEFUL LIVES AND ARE MEASURED FOR IMPAIRMENT ONLY WHEN EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THE CARRYING VALUE MAY BE IMPAIRED. IN THESE CASES, WE ESTIMATE THE FUTURE UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS TO BE DERIVED FROM THE ASSET TO

DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT A POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT EXISTS. IF THE CARRYING VALUE EXCEEDS OUR ESTIMATE OF FUTURE UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS, WE THEN CALCULATE THE IMPAIRMENT AS THE EXCESS OF THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE ASSET OVER OUR ESTIMATE OF ITS FAIR

VALUE. ANY IMPAIRMENT CHARGES WOULD BE CLASSIFIED AS OTHER EXPENSE, NET.

HEDGE ACCOUNTING FOR DERIVATIVES

WE USE FORWARD EXCHANGE CONTRACTS AND OPTION CONTRACTS TO HEDGE CERTAIN ANTICIPATED FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE TRANSACTIONS, AS WELL AS ANY RESULTING

RECEIVABLE OR PAYABLE BALANCE. WHEN SPECIFIC CRITERIA REQUIRED BY SFAS NO. 133, ACCOUNTING FOR DERIVATIVE AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES, AS AMENDED AND INTERPRETED (FAS 133) HAVE BEEN MET, CHANGES IN FAIR VALUES OF HEDGE

CONTRACTS RELATING TO ANTICIPATED TRANSACTIONS ARE RECORDED IN OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME RATHER THAN NET INCOME UNTIL THE UNDERLYING HEDGED TRANSACTION AFFECTS NET INCOME. IN MOST CASES, THIS RESULTS IN GAINS AND LOSSES ON HEDGE DERIVATIVES BEING

RELEASED FROM OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME INTO NET INCOME SOME TIME AFTER THE MATURITY OF THE DERIVATIVE. ONE OF THE CRITERIA FOR THIS ACCOUNTING TREATMENT IS THAT THE FORWARD EXCHANGE CONTRACT AMOUNT SHOULD NOT BE IN EXCESS OF SPECIFICALLY

IDENTIFIED ANTICIPATED TRANSACTIONS. BY THEIR VERY NATURE, OUR ESTIMATES OF ANTICIPATED TRANSACTIONS MAY FLUCTUATE OVER TIME AND MAY ULTIMATELY VARY FROM ACTUAL TRANSACTIONS. WHEN ANTICIPATED TRANSACTION ESTIMATES OR ACTUAL TRANSACTION AMOUNTS

DECREASE BELOW HEDGED LEVELS, OR WHEN THE TIMING OF TRANSACTIONS CHANGES SIGNIFICANTLY, WE ARE REQUIRED TO RECLASSIFY AT LEAST A PORTION OF THE CUMULATIVE CHANGES IN FAIR VALUES OF THE RELATED HEDGE CONTRACTS FROM OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME TO OTHER

EXPENSE, NET DURING THE QUARTER IN WHICH SUCH CHANGES OCCUR. ONCE AN ANTICIPATED TRANSACTION ESTIMATE OR ACTUAL TRANSACTION AMOUNT DECREASES BELOW HEDGED LEVELS, WE MAKE ADJUSTMENTS TO THE RELATED HEDGE CONTRACT IN ORDER TO REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF THE

HEDGE CONTRACT TO THAT OF THE REVISED ANTICIPATED TRANSACTION.

TAXES

WE RECORD VALUATION ALLOWANCES AGAINST OUR DEFERRED TAX ASSETS, WHEN NECESSARY, IN ACCORDANCE WITH SFAS NO. 109, ACCOUNTING FOR INCOME

TAXES. REALIZATION OF DEFERRED TAX ASSETS (SUCH AS NET OPERATING LOSS CARRYFORWARDS) IS DEPENDENT ON FUTURE TAXABLE EARNINGS AND IS THEREFORE UNCERTAIN. AT LEAST QUARTERLY, WE ASSESS THE LIKELIHOOD THAT OUR DEFERRED TAX ASSET BALANCE WILL BE

RECOVERED FROM FUTURE TAXABLE INCOME. TO THE EXTENT WE BELIEVE THAT RECOVERY IS NOT LIKELY, WE ESTABLISH A VALUATION ALLOWANCE AGAINST OUR DEFERRED TAX ASSET, INCREASING OUR INCOME TAX EXPENSE IN THE PERIOD SUCH DETERMINATION IS MADE.

IN ADDITION, WE HAVE NOT RECORDED U.S. INCOME TAX EXPENSE FOR FOREIGN EARNINGS THAT WE HAVE DETERMINED TO BE INDEFINITELY REINVESTED OFFSHORE, THUS

REDUCING OUR OVERALL INCOME TAX EXPENSE. THE AMOUNT OF EARNINGS DESIGNATED AS INDEFINITELY REINVESTED OFFSHORE IS BASED UPON THE ACTUAL DEPLOYMENT OF SUCH EARNINGS IN OUR OFFSHORE ASSETS AND OUR EXPECTATIONS OF THE FUTURE CASH NEEDS OF OUR U.S. AND

FOREIGN ENTITIES. INCOME TAX CONSIDERATIONS ARE ALSO A FACTOR IN DETERMINING THE AMOUNT OF FOREIGN EARNINGS TO BE INDEFINITELY REINVESTED OFFSHORE.

38

TABLE OF CONTENTS

WE CAREFULLY REVIEW ALL FACTORS THAT DRIVE THE ULTIMATE DISPOSITION OF FOREIGN EARNINGS DETERMINED TO BE

REINVESTED OFFSHORE, AND APPLY STRINGENT STANDARDS TO OVERCOMING THE PRESUMPTION OF REPATRIATION. DESPITE THIS APPROACH, BECAUSE THE DETERMINATION INVOLVES OUR FUTURE PLANS AND EXPECTATIONS OF FUTURE EVENTS, THE POSSIBILITY EXISTS THAT AMOUNTS

DECLARED AS INDEFINITELY REINVESTED OFFSHORE MAY ULTIMATELY BE REPATRIATED. FOR INSTANCE, THE ACTUAL CASH NEEDS OF OUR U.S. ENTITIES MAY EXCEED OUR CURRENT EXPECTATIONS, OR THE ACTUAL CASH NEEDS OF OUR FOREIGN ENTITIES MAY BE LESS THAN OUR CURRENT

EXPECTATIONS. THIS WOULD RESULT IN ADDITIONAL INCOME TAX EXPENSE IN THE YEAR WE DETERMINED THAT AMOUNTS WERE NO LONGER INDEFINITELY REINVESTED OFFSHORE. CONVERSELY, OUR APPROACH MAY ALSO RESULT IN A DETERMINATION THAT ACCUMULATED FOREIGN EARNINGS

(FOR WHICH U.S. INCOME TAXES HAVE BEEN PROVIDED) WILL BE INDEFINITELY REINVESTED OFFSHORE. IN THIS CASE, OUR INCOME TAX EXPENSE WOULD BE REDUCED IN THE YEAR OF SUCH DETERMINATION.

ON AN INTERIM BASIS, WE ESTIMATE WHAT OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE WILL BE FOR THE FULL FISCAL YEAR. THE ESTIMATED ANNUAL EFFECTIVE TAX RATE IS THEN APPLIED TO

THE YEAR-TO-DATE PRE-TAX INCOME EXCLUDING SIGNIFICANT OR INFREQUENTLY OCCURRING ITEMS, TO DETERMINE THE YEAR-TO-DATE TAX EXPENSE. THE INCOME TAX EFFECTS OF INFREQUENT OR UNUSUAL ITEMS ARE RECOGNIZED IN THE INTERIM PERIOD IN WHICH THEY OCCUR. AS THE

FISCAL YEAR PROGRESSES, WE CONTINUALLY REFINE OUR ESTIMATE BASED UPON ACTUAL EVENTS AND EARNINGS BY JURISDICTION DURING THE YEAR. THIS CONTINUAL ESTIMATION PROCESS PERIODICALLY RESULTS IN A CHANGE TO OUR EXPECTED EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR THE FISCAL

YEAR. WHEN THIS OCCURS, WE ADJUST THE INCOME TAX PROVISION DURING THE QUARTER IN WHICH THE CHANGE IN ESTIMATE OCCURS SO THAT THE YEAR-TO-DATE PROVISION EQUALS THE EXPECTED ANNUAL RATE.

OTHER CONTINGENCIES

IN THE

ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS, WE ARE INVOLVED IN LEGAL PROCEEDINGS REGARDING CONTRACTUAL AND EMPLOYMENT RELATIONSHIPS, PRODUCT LIABILITY CLAIMS, TRADEMARK RIGHTS, AND A VARIETY OF OTHER MATTERS. WE RECORD CONTINGENT LIABILITIES RESULTING FROM CLAIMS

AGAINST US, INCLUDING RELATED LEGAL COSTS, WHEN IT IS PROBABLE THAT A LIABILITY HAS BEEN INCURRED AND THE AMOUNT OF THE LOSS IS REASONABLY ESTIMABLE. WE DISCLOSE CONTINGENT LIABILITIES WHEN THERE IS A REASONABLE POSSIBILITY THAT THE ULTIMATE LOSS

WILL MATERIALLY EXCEED THE RECORDED LIABILITY. ESTIMATING PROBABLE LOSSES REQUIRES ANALYSIS OF MULTIPLE FACTORS, IN SOME CASES INCLUDING JUDGMENTS ABOUT THE POTENTIAL ACTIONS OF THIRD PARTY CLAIMANTS AND COURTS. THEREFORE, ACTUAL LOSSES IN ANY

FUTURE PERIOD ARE INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN. CURRENTLY, WE DO NOT BELIEVE THAT ANY OF OUR PENDING LEGAL PROCEEDINGS OR CLAIMS WILL HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR FINANCIAL POSITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. HOWEVER, IF ACTUAL OR ESTIMATED PROBABLE FUTURE

LOSSES EXCEED OUR RECORDED LIABILITY FOR SUCH CLAIMS, WE WOULD RECORD ADDITIONAL CHARGES AS OTHER EXPENSE, NET DURING THE PERIOD IN WHICH THE ACTUAL LOSS OR CHANGE IN ESTIMATE OCCURRED.

ITEM 7A.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS AND CONSISTENT WITH ESTABLISHED POLICIES AND PROCEDURES, WE EMPLOY A VARIETY OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS TO MANAGE EXPOSURE TO FLUCTUATIONS IN THE VALUE OF FOREIGN CURRENCIES AND INTEREST

RATES. IT IS OUR POLICY TO UTILIZE THESE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS ONLY WHERE NECESSARY TO FINANCE OUR BUSINESS AND MANAGE SUCH EXPOSURES; WE DO NOT ENTER INTO THESE TRANSACTIONS FOR SPECULATIVE PURPOSES.

WE ARE EXPOSED TO FOREIGN CURRENCY FLUCTUATION AS A RESULT OF OUR INTERNATIONAL SALES, PRODUCT SOURCING AND FUNDING ACTIVITIES. OUR FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK

MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVE IS TO REDUCE THE VARIABILITY OF LOCAL ENTITY CASH FLOWS AS A RESULT OF EXCHANGE RATE MOVEMENTS. WE USE FORWARD EXCHANGE CONTRACTS AND OPTIONS TO HEDGE CERTAIN ANTICIPATED BUT NOT YET FIRMLY COMMITTED TRANSACTIONS AS WELL AS

CERTAIN FIRM COMMITMENTS AND THE RELATED RECEIVABLES AND PAYABLES, INCLUDING THIRD PARTY AND INTERCOMPANY TRANSACTIONS.

WHEN WE BEGIN

HEDGING EXPOSURES DEPENDS ON THE NATURE OF THE EXPOSURE AND MARKET CONDITIONS. GENERALLY, ALL ANTICIPATED AND FIRMLY COMMITTED TRANSACTIONS THAT ARE HEDGED ARE TO BE RECOGNIZED WITHIN TWELVE MONTHS, ALTHOUGH AT MAY 31, 2006 WE HAD FORWARD

CONTRACTS HEDGING ANTICIPATED TRANSACTIONS THAT WILL BE RECOGNIZED IN AS MANY AS 18 MONTHS. THE MAJORITY OF THE CONTRACTS EXPIRING IN MORE THAN TWELVE MONTHS RELATE TO THE ANTICIPATED PURCHASE OF INVENTORY BY OUR EUROPEAN AND JAPANESE SUBSIDIARIES.

WE USE FORWARD CONTRACTS TO HEDGE

39

TABLE OF CONTENTS

NON-FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY DENOMINATED PAYMENTS UNDER INTERCOMPANY LOAN AGREEMENTS. WHEN INTERCOMPANY LOANS ARE HEDGED, IT IS TYPICALLY FOR THEIR EXPECTED

DURATION. HEDGED TRANSACTIONS ARE PRINCIPALLY DENOMINATED IN EUROS, JAPANESE YEN, KOREAN WON, CANADIAN DOLLARS AND MEXICAN PESOS.

OUR

EARNINGS ARE ALSO EXPOSED TO MOVEMENTS IN SHORT AND LONG-TERM MARKET INTEREST RATES. OUR OBJECTIVE IN MANAGING THIS INTEREST RATE EXPOSURE IS TO LIMIT THE IMPACT OF INTEREST RATE CHANGES ON EARNINGS AND CASH FLOWS, AND TO REDUCE OVERALL BORROWING

COSTS. TO ACHIEVE THESE OBJECTIVES, WE MAINTAIN A MIX OF MEDIUM AND LONG-TERM FIXED RATE DEBT, COMMERCIAL PAPER, AND BANK LOANS AND HAVE ENTERED INTO INTEREST RATE SWAPS.

MARKET RISK MEASUREMENT

WE MONITOR FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK, INTEREST RATE RISK AND RELATED DERIVATIVES

USING A VARIETY OF TECHNIQUES INCLUDING A REVIEW OF MARKET VALUE, SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS, AND VALUE-AT-RISK (VAR). OUR MARKET-SENSITIVE DERIVATIVE AND OTHER FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, AS DEFINED BY THE SEC, ARE FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD

CONTRACTS, FOREIGN CURRENCY OPTION CONTRACTS, INTEREST RATE SWAPS, INTERCOMPANY LOANS DENOMINATED IN NON-FUNCTIONAL CURRENCIES, FIXED INTEREST RATE U.S. DOLLAR DENOMINATED DEBT, AND FIXED INTEREST RATE JAPANESE YEN DENOMINATED DEBT.

WE USE VAR TO MONITOR THE FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK OF OUR FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD AND FOREIGN CURRENCY OPTION DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS ONLY. THE VAR

DETERMINES THE MAXIMUM POTENTIAL ONE-DAY LOSS IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THESE FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATE-SENSITIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS. THE VAR MODEL ESTIMATES ASSUME NORMAL MARKET CONDITIONS AND A 95% CONFIDENCE LEVEL. THERE ARE VARIOUS MODELING TECHNIQUES

THAT CAN BE USED IN THE VAR COMPUTATION. OUR COMPUTATIONS ARE BASED ON INTERRELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN CURRENCIES AND INTEREST RATES (A VARIANCE/CO-VARIANCE TECHNIQUE). THESE INTERRELATIONSHIPS ARE A FUNCTION OF FOREIGN EXCHANGE CURRENCY

MARKET CHANGES AND INTEREST RATE CHANGES OVER THE PRECEDING ONE YEAR PERIOD. THE VALUE OF FOREIGN CURRENCY OPTIONS DOES NOT CHANGE ON A ONE-TO-ONE BASIS WITH CHANGES IN THE UNDERLYING CURRENCY RATE. WE ADJUSTED THE POTENTIAL LOSS IN OPTION VALUE FOR

THE ESTIMATED SENSITIVITY (THE DELTA AND GAMMA) TO CHANGES IN THE UNDERLYING CURRENCY RATE. THIS CALCULATION REFLECTS THE IMPACT OF FOREIGN CURRENCY RATE FLUCTUATIONS ON THE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS ONLY, AND DOES NOT INCLUDE

THE IMPACT OF SUCH RATE FLUCTUATIONS ON NON-FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY TRANSACTIONS (SUCH AS ANTICIPATED TRANSACTIONS, FIRM COMMITMENTS, CASH BALANCES, AND ACCOUNTS AND LOANS RECEIVABLE AND PAYABLE), INCLUDING THOSE WHICH ARE HEDGED BY THESE INSTRUMENTS.

THE VAR MODEL IS A RISK ANALYSIS TOOL AND DOES NOT PURPORT TO REPRESENT ACTUAL LOSSES IN FAIR VALUE THAT WE WILL INCUR, NOR DOES IT

CONSIDER THE POTENTIAL EFFECT OF FAVORABLE CHANGES IN MARKET RATES. IT ALSO DOES NOT REPRESENT THE FULL EXTENT OF THE POSSIBLE LOSS THAT MAY OCCUR. ACTUAL FUTURE GAINS AND LOSSES WILL DIFFER FROM THOSE ESTIMATED BECAUSE OF CHANGES OR DIFFERENCES IN

MARKET RATES AND INTERRELATIONSHIPS, HEDGING INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGE PERCENTAGES, TIMING AND OTHER FACTORS.

THE ESTIMATED MAXIMUM ONE-DAY

LOSS IN FAIR VALUE ON OUR FOREIGN CURRENCY SENSITIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, DERIVED USING THE VAR MODEL, WAS $17.5 MILLION AND $25.7 MILLION AT MAY 31, 2006 AND MAY 31, 2005, RESPECTIVELY. THE DECREASE IN VAR AS OF MAY 31, 2006

OCCURRED DUE TO A LOWER NOTIONAL VALUE OF OUTSTANDING FOREIGN CURRENCY DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AS OF MAY 31, 2006 COMPARED TO MAY 31, 2005. SUCH A HYPOTHETICAL LOSS IN FAIR VALUE OF OUR DERIVATIVES WOULD BE OFFSET BY INCREASES IN THE VALUE

OF THE UNDERLYING TRANSACTIONS BEING HEDGED. THE AVERAGE MONTHLY CHANGE IN THE FAIR VALUES OF FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD AND FOREIGN CURRENCY OPTION DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS WAS $34.9 MILLION AND $37.2 MILLION FOR FISCAL 2006 AND FISCAL 2005,

RESPECTIVELY.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE FIXED INTEREST RATE JAPANESE YEN DENOMINATED DEBTS WERE ISSUED BY AND ARE ACCOUNTED FOR BY TWO OF OUR

JAPANESE SUBSIDIARIES. ACCORDINGLY, THE MONTHLY REMEASUREMENT OF THESE INSTRUMENTS DUE TO CHANGES IN FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES IS RECOGNIZED IN ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME UPON THE CONSOLIDATION OF THESE SUBSIDIARIES.

THERE WERE NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN DEBT MARKET RISKS DURING FISCAL 2006. WE DID NOT ISSUE ANY LONG-TERM FIXED-RATE CORPORATE BONDS DURING FISCAL 2006

OR 2005; HOWEVER, IN PREVIOUS YEARS WE ISSUED A TOTAL OF $490 MILLION IN LONG-TERM FIXED-RATE CORPORATE BONDS THAT MATURE BETWEEN AUGUST 2006 AND OCTOBER 2015. FIXED INTEREST RATES ON THESE BONDS RANGE FROM 4.7% TO 5.66%. FOR EACH OF THE BONDS

ISSUED, WE HAVE ENTERED INTO INTEREST RATE SWAP AGREEMENTS WHEREBY WE RECEIVE FIXED INTEREST PAYMENTS AT THE SAME RATE AS THE BONDS AND PAY VARIABLE INTEREST PAYMENTS BASED ON THE THREE-MONTH OR SIX-MONTH LIBOR PLUS A SPREAD. AS A RESULT OF THE

INTEREST RATE SWAP AGREEMENTS THE AVERAGE EFFECTIVE INTEREST RATE PAYABLE ON THESE BONDS WAS 6.07% AT MAY 31, 2006 AND 4.17% AT MAY 31, 2005. FOR $440 MILLION OF THE ISSUED BONDS, THE ASSOCIATED SWAPS HAVE THE SAME NOTIONAL AMOUNT AND

MATURITY DATE AS THE CORRESPONDING BOND. THESE INTEREST RATE SWAPS ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AS FAIR VALUE HEDGES, SO CHANGES IN THE RECORDED FAIR VALUES OF THE SWAPS ARE OFFSET BY CHANGES IN THE RECORDED FAIR VALUE OF THE RELATED DEBT. THE REMAINING $50

MILLION BOND MATURES IN OCTOBER 2013 WHEREAS THE ASSOCIATED INTEREST RATE SWAP EXPIRES IN OCTOBER 2006. ACCORDINGLY, CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THIS SWAP ARE RECORDED TO NET INCOME EACH PERIOD. THE RECORDED FAIR VALUE OF THE INTEREST RATE SWAPS

ACCOUNTED FOR AS FAIR VALUE HEDGES WAS A NET $5.6 MILLION LOSS AT MAY 31, 2006 AND A $9.0 MILLION GAIN AT MAY 31, 2005. THE CHANGE IN FAIR VALUE OF THE $50 MILLION INTEREST RATE SWAP EXPIRING OCTOBER 2006 WAS NOT MATERIAL FOR THE YEARS

ENDED MAY 31, 2006, 2005 AND 2004.

IN FISCAL 2003 WE ALSO ENTERED INTO AN INTEREST RATE SWAP AGREEMENT RELATED TO A JAPANESE YEN

DENOMINATED INTERCOMPANY LOAN WITH ONE OF OUR JAPANESE SUBSIDIARIES. THE JAPANESE SUBSIDIARY PAYS VARIABLE INTEREST ON THE INTERCOMPANY LOAN BASED ON 3-MONTH LIBOR PLUS A SPREAD. UNDER THE INTEREST RATE SWAP AGREEMENT, THE SUBSIDIARY PAYS FIXED

INTEREST PAYMENTS AT 0.8% AND RECEIVES VARIABLE INTEREST PAYMENTS BASED ON 3-MONTH LIBOR PLUS A SPREAD BASED ON A NOTIONAL AMOUNT OF 8 BILLION JAPANESE YEN. THIS INTEREST RATE SWAP IS NOT ACCOUNTED FOR AS A HEDGE, ACCORDINGLY CHANGES IN THE FAIR

VALUE OF THE SWAP ARE RECORDED TO NET INCOME EACH PERIOD. THE CHANGE IN FAIR VALUE OF THE SWAP WAS NOT MATERIAL FOR THE YEARS ENDED MAY 31, 2006, 2005 AND 2004.

MANAGEMENTS REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

MANAGEMENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ESTABLISHING AND MAINTAINING ADEQUATE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, AS SUCH TERM IS DEFINED IN EXCHANGE ACT

RULE 13A-15(F). UNDER THE SUPERVISION AND WITH THE PARTICIPATION OF OUR CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER, OUR MANAGEMENT CONDUCTED AN EVALUATION OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING BASED UPON THE

FRAMEWORK IN

INTERNAL CONTROL  INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK

ISSUED BY THE COMMITTEE OF SPONSORING ORGANIZATIONS OF THE TREADWAY COMMISSION. BASED ON THAT EVALUATION, OUR MANAGEMENT CONCLUDED THAT OUR INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING IS

EFFECTIVE AS OF MAY 31, 2006.

INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING CANNOT PROVIDE ABSOLUTE ASSURANCE OF ACHIEVING FINANCIAL

REPORTING OBJECTIVES BECAUSE OF ITS INHERENT LIMITATIONS. INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING IS A PROCESS THAT INVOLVES HUMAN DILIGENCE AND COMPLIANCE AND IS SUBJECT TO LAPSES IN JUDGMENT AND BREAKDOWNS RESULTING FROM HUMAN FAILURES. INTERNAL

CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING ALSO CAN BE CIRCUMVENTED BY COLLUSION OR IMPROPER MANAGEMENT OVERRIDE. BECAUSE OF SUCH LIMITATIONS, THERE IS A RISK THAT MATERIAL MISSTATEMENTS MAY NOT BE PREVENTED OR DETECTED ON A TIMELY BASIS BY INTERNAL CONTROL

OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING. HOWEVER, THESE INHERENT LIMITATIONS ARE KNOWN FEATURES OF THE FINANCIAL REPORTING PROCESS. THEREFORE, IT IS POSSIBLE TO DESIGN INTO THE PROCESS SAFEGUARDS TO REDUCE, THOUGH NOT ELIMINATE, THIS RISK.

PRICEWATERHOUSECOOPERS LLP, AN INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM, HAS AUDITED (1) THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS,

(2) MANAGEMENTS ASSESSMENT OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF MAY 31, 2006 AND (3) THE EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF MAY 31, 2006, AS STATED IN

THEIR REPORT HEREIN.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

TO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND

SHAREHOLDERS OF NIKE, INC..

WE HAVE COMPLETED INTEGRATED AUDITS OF NIKE, INC.S 2006 AND 2005 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND OF ITS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF MAY 31, 2006 AND AN AUDIT OF ITS 2004

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE STANDARDS OF THE PUBLIC COMPANY ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BOARD (UNITED STATES). OUR OPINIONS, BASED ON OUR AUDITS, ARE PRESENTED BELOW.

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND FINANCIAL STATEMENT SCHEDULE

IN OUR OPINION, THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS LISTED IN THE INDEX APPEARING UNDER ITEM 15(A)(1) PRESENT FAIRLY, IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS, THE FINANCIAL POSITION OF NIKE, INC. AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES AT

MAY 31, 2006 AND 2005, AND THE RESULTS OF THEIR OPERATIONS AND THEIR CASH FLOWS FOR EACH OF THE THREE YEARS IN THE PERIOD ENDED MAY 31, 2006 IN CONFORMITY WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. IN

ADDITION, IN OUR OPINION, THE FINANCIAL STATEMENT SCHEDULE LISTED IN THE INDEX APPEARING UNDER ITEM 15(A)(2) PRESENTS FAIRLY, IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS, THE INFORMATION SET FORTH THEREIN WHEN READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE RELATED CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND FINANCIAL STATEMENT SCHEDULE ARE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE COMPANYS MANAGEMENT. OUR RESPONSIBILITY IS TO EXPRESS AN OPINION ON THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND FINANCIAL STATEMENT SCHEDULE

BASED ON OUR AUDITS. WE CONDUCTED OUR AUDITS OF THESE STATEMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE STANDARDS OF THE PUBLIC COMPANY ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BOARD (UNITED STATES). THOSE STANDARDS REQUIRE THAT WE PLAN AND PERFORM THE AUDIT TO OBTAIN REASONABLE

ASSURANCE ABOUT WHETHER THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE FREE OF MATERIAL MISSTATEMENT. AN AUDIT OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDES EXAMINING, ON A TEST BASIS, EVIDENCE SUPPORTING THE AMOUNTS AND DISCLOSURES IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, ASSESSING THE

ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES USED AND SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES MADE BY MANAGEMENT, AND EVALUATING THE OVERALL FINANCIAL STATEMENT PRESENTATION. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR AUDITS PROVIDE A REASONABLE BASIS FOR OUR OPINION.

INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

ALSO, IN

OUR OPINION, MANAGEMENTS ASSESSMENT, INCLUDED IN MANAGEMENTS REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING APPEARING UNDER ITEM 8, THAT THE COMPANY MAINTAINED EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS

OF MAY 31, 2006 BASED ON CRITERIA ESTABLISHED IN

INTERNAL CONTROL  INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK

ISSUED BY THE COMMITTEE OF SPONSORING ORGANIZATIONS OF THE TREADWAY COMMISSION (COSO), IS FAIRLY STATED, IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS,

BASED ON THOSE CRITERIA. FURTHERMORE, IN OUR OPINION, THE COMPANY MAINTAINED, IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS, EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF MAY 31, 2006, BASED ON CRITERIA ESTABLISHED IN

INTERNAL CONTROL 

INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK

ISSUED BY THE COSO. THE COMPANYS MANAGEMENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR MAINTAINING EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AND FOR ITS ASSESSMENT OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING.

OUR RESPONSIBILITY IS TO EXPRESS OPINIONS ON MANAGEMENTS ASSESSMENT AND ON THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING BASED ON OUR AUDIT. WE CONDUCTED OUR AUDIT OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL

REPORTING IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE STANDARDS OF THE PUBLIC COMPANY ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BOARD (UNITED STATES). THOSE STANDARDS REQUIRE THAT WE PLAN AND PERFORM THE AUDIT TO OBTAIN REASONABLE ASSURANCE ABOUT WHETHER EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER

FINANCIAL REPORTING WAS MAINTAINED IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS. AN AUDIT OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING INCLUDES OBTAINING AN UNDERSTANDING OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, EVALUATING MANAGEMENTS ASSESSMENT, TESTING AND

EVALUATING THE DESIGN AND OPERATING EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL CONTROL, AND PERFORMING SUCH OTHER PROCEDURES AS WE CONSIDER NECESSARY IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR AUDIT PROVIDES A REASONABLE BASIS FOR OUR OPINIONS.

A COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING IS A PROCESS DESIGNED TO PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING THE RELIABILITY OF FINANCIAL

REPORTING AND THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR EXTERNAL PURPOSES IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES. A COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

44

TABLE OF CONTENTS

INCLUDES THOSE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES THAT (I) PERTAIN TO THE MAINTENANCE OF RECORDS THAT, IN REASONABLE DETAIL, ACCURATELY AND FAIRLY REFLECT THE

TRANSACTIONS AND DISPOSITIONS OF THE ASSETS OF THE COMPANY; (II) PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE THAT TRANSACTIONS ARE RECORDED AS NECESSARY TO PERMIT PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES,

AND THAT RECEIPTS AND EXPENDITURES OF THE COMPANY ARE BEING MADE ONLY IN ACCORDANCE WITH AUTHORIZATIONS OF MANAGEMENT AND DIRECTORS OF THE COMPANY; AND (III) PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING PREVENTION OR TIMELY DETECTION OF UNAUTHORIZED

ACQUISITION, USE, OR DISPOSITION OF THE COMPANYS ASSETS THAT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

BECAUSE OF

ITS INHERENT LIMITATIONS, INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING MAY NOT PREVENT OR DETECT MISSTATEMENTS. ALSO, PROJECTIONS OF ANY EVALUATION OF EFFECTIVENESS TO FUTURE PERIODS ARE SUBJECT TO THE RISK THAT CONTROLS MAY BECOME INADEQUATE BECAUSE

OF CHANGES IN CONDITIONS, OR THAT THE DEGREE OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE POLICIES OR PROCEDURES MAY DETERIORATE.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 1  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

BASIS OF CONSOLIDATION

THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDE THE ACCOUNTS OF NIKE, INC. AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES

(THE COMPANY). ALL SIGNIFICANT INTERCOMPANY TRANSACTIONS AND BALANCES HAVE BEEN ELIMINATED.

RECOGNITION OF REVENUES

WHOLESALE REVENUES ARE RECOGNIZED WHEN THE RISKS AND REWARDS OF OWNERSHIP HAVE PASSED TO THE CUSTOMER, BASED ON THE TERMS OF SALE.

THIS OCCURS UPON SHIPMENT OR UPON RECEIPT BY THE CUSTOMER DEPENDING ON THE COUNTRY OF THE SALE AND THE AGREEMENT WITH THE CUSTOMER. RETAIL STORE REVENUES ARE RECORDED AT THE TIME OF SALE. PROVISIONS FOR SALES DISCOUNTS, RETURNS AND MISCELLANEOUS

CLAIMS FROM CUSTOMERS ARE MADE AT THE TIME OF SALE.

SHIPPING AND HANDLING COSTS

SHIPPING AND HANDLING COSTS ARE EXPENSED AS INCURRED AND INCLUDED IN COST OF SALES.

ADVERTISING AND PROMOTION

ADVERTISING PRODUCTION COSTS ARE EXPENSED THE FIRST TIME THE ADVERTISEMENT IS RUN. MEDIA (TV AND PRINT) PLACEMENT COSTS ARE EXPENSED IN THE MONTH THE ADVERTISING APPEARS. A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF THE COMPANYS PROMOTIONAL EXPENSES

RESULT FROM PAYMENTS UNDER ENDORSEMENT CONTRACTS. ACCOUNTING FOR ENDORSEMENT PAYMENTS IS BASED UPON SPECIFIC CONTRACT PROVISIONS. GENERALLY, ENDORSEMENT PAYMENTS ARE EXPENSED UNIFORMLY OVER THE TERM OF THE CONTRACT AFTER GIVING RECOGNITION TO

PERIODIC PERFORMANCE COMPLIANCE PROVISIONS OF THE CONTRACTS. PREPAYMENTS MADE UNDER CONTRACTS ARE INCLUDED IN PREPAID EXPENSES AND OTHER CURRENT ASSETS OR OTHER ASSETS DEPENDING ON THE LENGTH OF THE CONTRACT. THROUGH COOPERATIVE ADVERTISING

PROGRAMS, THE COMPANY REIMBURSES ITS RETAIL CUSTOMERS FOR CERTAIN OF THEIR COSTS OF ADVERTISING THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS. THE COMPANY RECORDS THESE COSTS IN SELLING AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE AT THE POINT IN TIME WHEN IT IS OBLIGATED TO ITS

CUSTOMERS FOR THE COSTS, WHICH IS WHEN THE RELATED REVENUES ARE RECOGNIZED. THIS OBLIGATION MAY ARISE PRIOR TO THE RELATED ADVERTISEMENT BEING RUN. TOTAL ADVERTISING AND PROMOTION EXPENSES WERE $1,740.2 MILLION, $1,600.7 MILLION, AND $1,377.9

MILLION FOR THE YEARS ENDED MAY 31, 2006, 2005 AND 2004, RESPECTIVELY. PREPAID ADVERTISING AND PROMOTION EXPENSES RECORDED AS APPROPRIATE IN PREPAID EXPENSES AND OTHER CURRENT ASSETS AND OTHER ASSETS TOTALED $177.1 MILLION AND $169.9 MILLION AT

MAY 31, 2006 AND 2005, RESPECTIVELY.

CASH AND EQUIVALENTS

CASH AND EQUIVALENTS REPRESENT CASH AND SHORT-TERM, HIGHLY LIQUID INVESTMENTS WITH MATURITIES OF THREE MONTHS OR LESS AT DATE OF PURCHASE. THE CARRYING

AMOUNTS REFLECTED IN THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET FOR CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS APPROXIMATE FAIR VALUE DUE TO THE SHORT MATURITIES.

SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS

SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS CONSIST OF HIGHLY LIQUID INVESTMENTS, PRIMARILY U.S. TREASURY DEBT

SECURITIES, WITH MATURITIES OVER THREE MONTHS FROM THE DATE OF PURCHASE. DEBT SECURITIES WHICH THE COMPANY HAS THE ABILITY AND POSITIVE INTENT TO HOLD TO MATURITY ARE CARRIED AT AMORTIZED COST. AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE DEBT SECURITIES ARE RECORDED AT FAIR

VALUE WITH ANY NET UNREALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES REPORTED, NET OF TAX, IN OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME. REALIZED GAINS OR LOSSES ARE DETERMINED BASED ON THE SPECIFIC IDENTIFICATION METHOD. THE COMPANY HOLDS NO INVESTMENTS CONSIDERED TO BE TRADING

SECURITIES. AMORTIZED COST OF BOTH AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE AND HELD-TO-MATURITY DEBT SECURITIES APPROXIMATES FAIR MARKET VALUE DUE TO THEIR SHORT MATURITIES. SUBSTANTIALLY ALL SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS HELD AT

TABLE OF CONTENTS

NIKE, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (CONTINUED)

MAY 31, 2006 HAVE REMAINING MATURITIES OF 180 DAYS OR LESS. INCLUDED IN INTEREST (INCOME) EXPENSE, NET FOR THE YEARS ENDED MAY 31, 2006, 2005, AND

2004, WAS INTEREST INCOME OF $87.3 MILLION, $34.9 MILLION AND $15.3 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, RELATED TO SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS AND CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS.

INVENTORY VALUATION

INVENTORIES ARE STATED AT THE LOWER OF COST OR MARKET. INVENTORIES ARE

VALUED ON A FIRST-IN, FIRST-OUT (FIFO) OR MOVING-AVERAGE COST BASIS.

PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT AND DEPRECIATION

PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT ARE RECORDED AT COST. DEPRECIATION FOR FINANCIAL REPORTING PURPOSES IS DETERMINED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE

BASIS FOR BUILDINGS AND LEASEHOLD IMPROVEMENTS OVER 2 TO 40 YEARS AND PRINCIPALLY ON A DOUBLE DECLINING BALANCE BASIS FOR MACHINERY AND EQUIPMENT OVER 2 TO 15 YEARS. COMPUTER SOFTWARE (INCLUDING, IN SOME CASES, THE COST OF INTERNAL LABOR) IS

DEPRECIATED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER 3 TO 10 YEARS.

IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS

IN ACCORDANCE WITH STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS (SFAS) NO. 144 ACCOUNTING FOR THE IMPAIRMENT OR DISPOSAL OF

LONG-LIVED ASSETS (FAS 144), THE COMPANY ESTIMATES THE FUTURE UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS TO BE DERIVED FROM AN ASSET TO ASSESS WHETHER OR NOT A POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT EXISTS WHEN EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THE CARRYING VALUE OF A

LONG-LIVED ASSET MAY BE IMPAIRED. IF THE CARRYING VALUE EXCEEDS THE COMPANYS ESTIMATE OF FUTURE UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS, THE COMPANY THEN CALCULATES THE IMPAIRMENT AS THE EXCESS OF THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE ASSET OVER THE COMPANYS

ESTIMATE OF ITS FAIR MARKET VALUE.

IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND GOODWILL

IN ACCORDANCE WITH SFAS NO. 142 GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS (FAS 142), GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS WITH

INDEFINITE LIVES ARE NOT AMORTIZED BUT INSTEAD ARE MEASURED FOR IMPAIRMENT AT LEAST ANNUALLY IN THE FOURTH QUARTER, OR WHEN EVENTS INDICATE THAT AN IMPAIRMENT EXISTS. AS REQUIRED BY FAS 142, IN THE COMPANYS IMPAIRMENT TEST OF GOODWILL, THE

COMPANY COMPARES THE FAIR VALUE OF THE APPLICABLE REPORTING UNIT TO ITS CARRYING VALUE. THE COMPANY ESTIMATES THE FAIR VALUE OF ITS REPORTING UNITS BY USING A COMBINATION OF DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW ANALYSIS AND COMPARISONS WITH THE MARKET VALUES OF

SIMILAR PUBLICLY TRADED COMPANIES. IF THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE REPORTING UNIT EXCEEDS THE ESTIMATE OF FAIR VALUE, THE COMPANY CALCULATES THE IMPAIRMENT AS THE EXCESS OF THE CARRYING VALUE OF GOODWILL OVER ITS IMPLIED FAIR VALUE. IN THE IMPAIRMENT

TESTS FOR INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS, THE COMPANY COMPARES THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF THE INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS TO THE CARRYING VALUE. THE COMPANY ESTIMATES THE FAIR VALUE OF INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS, TRADEMARKS,

USING THE RELIEF FROM ROYALTY APPROACH, WHICH IS A STANDARD FORM OF DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW ANALYSIS TYPICALLY USED FOR THE VALUATION OF TRADEMARKS. IF THE CARRYING VALUE EXCEEDS THE ESTIMATE OF FAIR VALUE, THE COMPANY CALCULATES IMPAIRMENT AS THE

EXCESS OF THE CARRYING VALUE OVER THE ESTIMATE OF FAIR VALUE.

INTANGIBLE ASSETS THAT ARE DETERMINED TO HAVE DEFINITE LIVES ARE AMORTIZED

OVER THEIR USEFUL LIVES AND ARE MEASURED FOR IMPAIRMENT ONLY WHEN EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THE CARRYING VALUE MAY BE IMPAIRED IN ACCORDANCE WITH FAS 144 DISCUSSED ABOVE.

FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION AND FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSACTIONS

ADJUSTMENTS RESULTING FROM TRANSLATING FOREIGN FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INTO U.S. DOLLARS ARE INCLUDED IN THE FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION

ADJUSTMENT, A COMPONENT OF ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME IN SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY.

ACCOUNTING FOR DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES

THE COMPANY USES DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS TO LIMIT EXPOSURE TO CHANGES IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES AND INTEREST RATES. THE COMPANY ACCOUNTS FOR DERIVATIVES PURSUANT TO SFAS NO. 133,

ACCOUNTING FOR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES, AS AMENDED AND INTERPRETED (FAS 133). FAS 133 ESTABLISHES ACCOUNTING AND REPORTING STANDARDS FOR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND REQUIRES THAT ALL DERIVATIVES BE

RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE ON THE BALANCE SHEET. CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS ARE EITHER RECOGNIZED IN OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (A COMPONENT OF SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY) OR NET INCOME DEPENDING ON WHETHER THE

DERIVATIVE IS BEING USED TO HEDGE CHANGES IN CASH FLOWS OR FAIR VALUE.

SEE NOTE 16 FOR MORE INFORMATION ON THE COMPANYS RISK

MANAGEMENT PROGRAM AND DERIVATIVES.

STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION

THE COMPANY USES THE INTRINSIC VALUE METHOD TO ACCOUNT FOR STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION IN ACCORDANCE WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES BOARD (APB)

OPINION NO. 25, ACCOUNTING FOR STOCK ISSUED TO EMPLOYEES AS PERMITTED BY SFAS NO. 123 ACCOUNTING FOR STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION (FAS 123). THE COMPANYS USUAL PRACTICE IS TO GRANT STOCK OPTIONS WITH

AN EXERCISE PRICE EQUAL TO THE MARKET VALUE AT THE DATE OF GRANT, AND ACCORDINGLY, NO COMPENSATION EXPENSE IS RECOGNIZED.

AS REQUIRED BY

FAS 123 AND AMENDED BY SFAS NO. 148 ACCOUNTING FOR STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION  TRANSITION AND DISCLOSURE (FAS 148), THE COMPANY HAS COMPUTED, FOR PRO FORMA DISCLOSURE PURPOSES, THE FAIR VALUE OF OPTIONS GRANTED AND

EMPLOYEES PURCHASE RIGHTS UNDER THE EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN (ESPP) DURING THE YEARS ENDED MAY 31, 2006, 2005 AND 2004 USING THE BLACK-SCHOLES OPTION PRICING MODEL. THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE ASSUMPTIONS USED FOR THE MAJORITY OF

STOCK OPTIONS GRANTED FOR EACH OF THE YEARS ENDED MAY 31, 2006, 2005 AND 2004 ARE AS FOLLOWS.

FOR THE YEAR ENDED MAY 31, 2006, THE COMPANY ESTIMATED THE EXPECTED VOLATILITY BASED ON

THE IMPLIED VOLATILITY IN MARKET TRADED OPTIONS ON THE COMPANYS COMMON STOCK, WITH A TERM OF GREATER THAN ONE YEAR. FOR THE YEARS ENDED MAY 31, 2005 AND 2004, THE COMPANY ESTIMATED THE EXPECTED VOLATILITY BASED ON THE HISTORICAL

VOLATILITY OF THE COMPANYS COMMON STOCK.

ADJUSTMENTS FOR FORFEITURES ARE MADE AS THEY OCCUR. FOR THE YEARS ENDED

MAY 31, 2006, 2005 AND 2004, THE TOTAL VALUE OF THE OPTIONS GRANTED, FOR WHICH NO PREVIOUS EXPENSE HAS BEEN RECOGNIZED, WAS COMPUTED AS APPROXIMATELY $111.6 MILLION, $150.2 MILLION, AND $102.3 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, WHICH WOULD BE AMORTIZED ON

A STRAIGHT LINE BASIS OVER THE VESTING PERIOD OF THE OPTIONS. THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE FAIR VALUE PER SHARE OF THE OPTIONS GRANTED IN THE YEARS ENDED MAY 31, 2006, 2005 AND 2004 ARE $19.35, $27.90, AND $20.36, RESPECTIVELY.

THE PRO FORMA EFFECTS OF APPLYING FAS 123 MAY NOT BE REPRESENTATIVE OF THE EFFECTS ON REPORTED NET

INCOME AND EARNINGS PER SHARE FOR FUTURE YEARS SINCE OPTIONS VEST OVER SEVERAL YEARS AND ADDITIONAL AWARDS ARE MADE EACH YEAR.

ON

DECEMBER 16, 2004, THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD (FASB) FINALIZED SFAS NO. 123R SHARE-BASED PAYMENT (FAS 123R) WHICH, AFTER THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (SEC) AMENDED THE

COMPLIANCE DATES ON APRIL 15, 2005, IS EFFECTIVE FOR THE COMPANYS FISCAL YEAR BEGINNING JUNE 1, 2006. THE NEW STANDARD WILL REQUIRE THE COMPANY TO RECORD COMPENSATION EXPENSE FOR STOCK OPTIONS USING A FAIR VALUE METHOD. ON

MARCH 29, 2005, THE SEC ISSUED STAFF ACCOUNTING BULLETIN NO. 107 (SAB 107), WHICH PROVIDES THE STAFFS VIEWS REGARDING INTERACTIONS BETWEEN FAS 123R AND CERTAIN SEC RULES AND REGULATIONS AND PROVIDES INTERPRETATIONS OF THE

VALUATION OF SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS FOR PUBLIC COMPANIES.

THE COMPANY PLANS TO ADOPT THE NEW REQUIREMENTS UNDER FAS 123R AND SAB 107

BEGINNING IN ITS QUARTER ENDING AUGUST 31, 2006 USING THE MODIFIED PROSPECTIVE TRANSITION METHOD AND THE BLACK-SCHOLES FAIR VALUE MODEL. AS A RESULT OF THE ADOPTION OF FAS 123R THE COMPANY WILL RECOGNIZE ADDITIONAL COMPENSATION EXPENSE OF

APPROXIMATELY $0.36 PER DILUTED SHARE IN THE FISCAL YEAR ENDING MAY 31, 2007. THE AMOUNT OF EXPENSE THAT WILL BE RECOGNIZED IS LARGELY DEPENDENT ON SEVERAL VARIABLES, INCLUDING THE LEVEL OF SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS THAT WILL BE GRANTED DURING THE

FISCAL YEAR IN ADDITION TO THE ASSUMPTIONS USED IN THE VALUATION MODEL. ACCORDINGLY, THE ACTUAL EFFECT PER DILUTED SHARE COULD DIFFER FROM THIS ESTIMATE. THE EFFECT ON THE COMPANYS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OF EXPENSING STOCK OPTIONS FOR THE YEARS

ENDING MAY 31, 2006, 2005 AND 2004 USING THE BLACK-SCHOLES MODEL IS PRESENTED IN THE TABLE ABOVE.

UNDER CERTAIN CONDITIONS, STOCK

OPTIONS GRANTED BY THE COMPANY ARE ELIGIBLE FOR ACCELERATED VESTING UPON THE RETIREMENT OF THE EMPLOYEE. THE FASB CLARIFIED IN FAS 123R THAT THE FAIR VALUE OF SUCH STOCK OPTIONS SHOULD BE EXPENSED BASED ON THE APPLICABLE ACCELERATED VESTING

SCHEDULE, RATHER THAN RATABLY OVER THE VESTING PERIOD STATED IN THE GRANT. THE COMPANYS PRO FORMA DISCLOSURE ABOVE CURRENTLY REFLECTS THE EXPENSE OF SUCH OPTIONS RATABLY OVER THE STATED VESTING PERIOD, EXPENSING ALL UNVESTED SHARES UPON ACTUAL

RETIREMENT. THE SEC CLARIFIED THAT COMPANIES SHOULD CONTINUE TO FOLLOW THE VESTING METHOD THEY HAVE BEEN USING UNTIL ADOPTION OF FAS 123R, THEN APPLY THE ACCELERATED VESTING SCHEDULE TO ALL SUBSEQUENT GRANTS TO THOSE EMPLOYEES ELIGIBLE FOR

ACCELERATED

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (CONTINUED)

VESTING UPON RETIREMENT. HAD THE COMPANY BEEN ACCOUNTING FOR SUCH STOCK OPTIONS USING THE ACCELERATED VESTING SCHEDULE FOR THOSE EMPLOYEES ELIGIBLE FOR

ACCELERATED VESTING UPON RETIREMENT, THE COMPANY WOULD HAVE RECOGNIZED ADDITIONAL STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE IN THE ABOVE PRO FORMA OF $0.01 PER DILUTED SHARE IN THE YEAR ENDED MAY 31, 2006 AND $0.05 PER DILUTED SHARE FOR THE YEARS ENDED

MAY 31, 2005 AND 2004. THE COMPANY USUALLY GRANTS THE MAJORITY OF STOCK OPTIONS IN A SINGLE GRANT IN THE FIRST THREE MONTHS OF EACH FISCAL YEAR. AS A RESULT, ACCELERATED VESTING WILL NORMALLY RESULT IN HIGHER EXPENSE IN THE FIRST THREE MONTHS

AND LOWER EXPENSE IN THE LAST NINE MONTHS OF EACH FISCAL YEAR, AS COMPARED TO THE PRO FORMA EXPENSE DISCLOSED BY THE COMPANY UNDER OUR CURRENT POLICY OF EXPENSING SUCH OPTIONS RATABLY OVER THE STATED VESTING PERIOD.

INCOME TAXES

THE COMPANY

ACCOUNTS FOR INCOME TAXES USING THE ASSET AND LIABILITY METHOD. THIS APPROACH REQUIRES THE RECOGNITION OF DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES FOR THE EXPECTED FUTURE TAX CONSEQUENCES OF TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE CARRYING AMOUNTS AND THE TAX

BASIS OF OTHER ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. UNITED STATES INCOME TAXES ARE PROVIDED CURRENTLY ON FINANCIAL STATEMENT EARNINGS OF NON-U.S. SUBSIDIARIES THAT ARE EXPECTED TO BE REPATRIATED. THE COMPANY DETERMINES ANNUALLY THE AMOUNT OF UNDISTRIBUTED

NON-U.S. EARNINGS TO INVEST INDEFINITELY IN ITS NON-U.S. OPERATIONS. SEE NOTE 8 FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION.

EARNINGS PER SHARE

BASIC EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE IS CALCULATED BY DIVIDING NET INCOME BY THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE NUMBER OF COMMON SHARES OUTSTANDING

DURING THE YEAR. DILUTED EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE IS CALCULATED BY ADJUSTING WEIGHTED AVERAGE OUTSTANDING SHARES, ASSUMING CONVERSION OF ALL POTENTIALLY DILUTIVE STOCK OPTIONS AND AWARDS. SEE NOTE 11 FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION.

MANAGEMENT ESTIMATES

THE

PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN CONFORMITY WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO MAKE ESTIMATES, INCLUDING ESTIMATES RELATING TO ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AND

DISCLOSURE OF CONTINGENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AT THE DATE OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF REVENUES AND EXPENSES DURING THE REPORTING PERIOD. ACTUAL RESULTS COULD DIFFER FROM THESE ESTIMATES.

RECLASSIFICATIONS

CERTAIN

PRIOR YEAR AMOUNTS HAVE BEEN RECLASSIFIED TO CONFORM TO FISCAL YEAR 2006 PRESENTATION. THESE CHANGES HAD NO IMPACT ON PREVIOUSLY REPORTED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY.

RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

IN NOVEMBER 2004, THE FASB ISSUED SFAS NO. 151, INVENTORY COSTS, AN AMENDMENT OF ARB NO. 43, CHAPTER 4 (FAS 151). FAS 151 CLARIFIES THAT ABNORMAL INVENTORY COSTS SUCH AS COSTS OF IDLE FACILITIES, EXCESS

FREIGHT AND HANDLING COSTS, AND WASTED MATERIALS (SPOILAGE) ARE REQUIRED TO BE RECOGNIZED AS CURRENT PERIOD CHARGES. THE PROVISIONS OF FAS 151 ARE EFFECTIVE FOR THE FISCAL YEAR BEGINNING JUNE 1, 2006. THE COMPANY HAS EVALUATED THE PROVISIONS OF

FAS 151 AND DOES NOT EXPECT THAT THE ADOPTION WILL HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE COMPANYS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL POSITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

IN DECEMBER 2004, THE FASB ISSUED FAS 123R. IN MARCH 2005, THE SEC ISSUED SAB 107 REGARDING THE SEC STAFFS INTERPRETATION OF FAS 123R. SEE THE STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION SECTION WITHIN NOTE 1 ABOVE FOR FURTHER

DISCUSSION.

THE PROVISIONS OF FIN 48 ARE EFFECTIVE FOR THE FISCAL YEAR BEGINNING JUNE 1, 2007. THE COMPANY IS CURRENTLY EVALUATING THE IMPACT OF THE PROVISIONS OF FIN 48.

APPROVED A DOMESTIC REINVESTMENT PLAN AS REQUIRED BY THE AMERICAN JOBS CREATION ACT OF 2004 (THE ACT) TO REPATRIATE $500 MILLION OF FOREIGN EARNINGS IN FISCAL 2006. THE ACT CREATES A TEMPORARY INCENTIVE FOR U.S. MULTINATIONAL

CORPORATIONS TO REPATRIATE ACCUMULATED INCOME EARNED OUTSIDE THE U.S. BY PROVIDING AN 85% DIVIDEND RECEIVED DEDUCTION FOR CERTAIN DIVIDENDS FROM CONTROLLED FOREIGN CORPORATIONS. A $500 MILLION REPATRIATION WAS MADE DURING THE QUARTER ENDING

MAY 31, 2006 COMPRISED OF BOTH FOREIGN EARNINGS FOR WHICH U.S. TAXES HAS PREVIOUSLY BEEN PROVIDED AND FOREIGN EARNINGS THAT HAD BEEN DESIGNATED AS PERMANENTLY REINVESTED. ACCORDINGLY, THE PROVISIONS MADE DID NOT HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE

COMPANYS INCOME TAX EXPENSE OR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR THE YEARS ENDED MAY 31, 2006 AND 2005.

THE COMPANY HAS INDEFINITELY REINVESTED

APPROXIMATELY $850.0 MILLION OF THE CUMULATIVE UNDISTRIBUTED EARNINGS OF CERTAIN FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES. SUCH EARNINGS WOULD BE SUBJECT TO U.S. TAXATION IF REPATRIATED TO THE U.S. THE AMOUNT OF UNRECOGNIZED DEFERRED TAX LIABILITY ASSOCIATED WITH THE

PERMANENTLY REINVESTED CUMULATIVE UNDISTRIBUTED EARNINGS WAS APPROXIMATELY $154.6 MILLION.

DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AT MAY 31, 2006 AND

2005 WERE REDUCED BY A VALUATION ALLOWANCE RELATING TO TAX BENEFITS OF CERTAIN FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES WITH OPERATING LOSSES WHERE IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT THE DEFERRED TAX ASSETS WILL NOT BE REALIZED.

A DEFERRED TAX ASSET HAS BEEN RECORDED FOR FOREIGN TAX CREDIT CARRYFORWARDS OF $9.5 MILLION AT MAY 31, 2006 WHICH EXPIRE BY THE YEAR ENDED

MAY 31, 2016.

DURING THE YEARS ENDED MAY 31, 2006, 2005, AND 2004, INCOME TAX BENEFITS ATTRIBUTABLE TO EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTION

TRANSACTIONS OF $54.2 MILLION, $63.1 MILLION, AND $47.2 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, WERE ALLOCATED TO SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY.

NOTE 16  RISK MANAGEMENT AND DERIVATIVES

THE COMPANY IS EXPOSED TO GLOBAL MARKET RISKS, INCLUDING THE EFFECT OF CHANGES IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES AND INTEREST RATES. THE COMPANY USES DERIVATIVES TO MANAGE FINANCIAL EXPOSURES THAT OCCUR IN THE NORMAL

COURSE OF BUSINESS. THE COMPANY DOES NOT HOLD OR ISSUE DERIVATIVES FOR TRADING PURPOSES.

BETWEEN HEDGING INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGED ITEMS, AS WELL AS ITS RISK-MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVE AND STRATEGY FOR UNDERTAKING HEDGE TRANSACTIONS. THIS PROCESS INCLUDES LINKING ALL DERIVATIVES TO EITHER SPECIFIC ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ON THE BALANCE SHEET OR

SPECIFIC FIRM COMMITMENTS OR FORECASTED TRANSACTIONS.

SUBSTANTIALLY ALL DERIVATIVES OUTSTANDING AS OF MAY 31, 2006 AND 2005 ARE

DESIGNATED AS EITHER CASH FLOW OR FAIR VALUE HEDGES. ALL DERIVATIVES ARE RECOGNIZED ON THE BALANCE SHEET AT THEIR FAIR VALUE. UNREALIZED GAIN POSITIONS ARE RECORDED AS OTHER CURRENT ASSETS OR OTHER NON-CURRENT ASSETS, DEPENDING ON THE

INSTRUMENTS MATURITY DATE. UNREALIZED LOSS POSITIONS ARE RECORDED AS ACCRUED LIABILITIES OR OTHER NON-CURRENT LIABILITIES. ALL CHANGES IN FAIR VALUES OF OUTSTANDING CASH FLOW HEDGE DERIVATIVES, EXCEPT THE INEFFECTIVE PORTION, ARE RECORDED IN

OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME, UNTIL NET INCOME IS AFFECTED BY THE VARIABILITY OF CASH FLOWS OF THE HEDGED TRANSACTION. FAIR VALUE HEDGES ARE RECORDED IN NET INCOME AND ARE OFFSET BY THE CHANGE IN FAIR VALUE OF THE UNDERLYING ASSET OR LIABILITY BEING

HEDGED.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

CASH FLOW HEDGES

THE PURPOSE OF THE COMPANYS FOREIGN CURRENCY HEDGING ACTIVITIES IS TO PROTECT THE COMPANY FROM THE RISK THAT THE EVENTUAL CASH FLOWS RESULTING FROM

TRANSACTIONS IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES, INCLUDING REVENUES, PRODUCT COSTS, SELLING AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES, INVESTMENTS IN U.S. DOLLAR-DENOMINATED AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE DEBT SECURITIES AND INTERCOMPANY TRANSACTIONS, INCLUDING INTERCOMPANY BORROWINGS,

WILL BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY CHANGES IN EXCHANGE RATES. IT IS THE COMPANYS POLICY TO UTILIZE DERIVATIVES TO REDUCE FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISKS WHERE INTERNAL NETTING STRATEGIES CANNOT BE EFFECTIVELY EMPLOYED.

DERIVATIVES USED BY THE COMPANY TO HEDGE FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RISKS ARE FORWARD EXCHANGE CONTRACTS, OPTIONS AND CROSS-CURRENCY SWAPS. THE

CROSS-CURRENCY SWAPS ARE USED TO HEDGE FOREIGN CURRENCY DENOMINATED PAYMENTS RELATED TO INTERCOMPANY LOAN AGREEMENTS. THERE ARE CURRENTLY NO CROSS-CURRENCY SWAPS OUTSTANDING. HEDGED TRANSACTIONS ARE DENOMINATED PRIMARILY IN EUROS, JAPANESE YEN,

KOREAN WON, CANADIAN DOLLARS AND MEXICAN PESOS. THE COMPANY HEDGES UP TO 100% OF ANTICIPATED EXPOSURES TYPICALLY TWELVE MONTHS IN ADVANCE BUT HAS HEDGED AS MUCH AS 32 MONTHS IN ADVANCE. WHEN INTERCOMPANY LOANS ARE HEDGED, IT IS TYPICALLY FOR THEIR

EXPECTED DURATION.

SUBSTANTIALLY ALL FOREIGN CURRENCY DERIVATIVES OUTSTANDING AS OF MAY 31, 2006 AND 2005 QUALIFY FOR AND ARE

DESIGNATED AS FOREIGN-CURRENCY CASH FLOW HEDGES, INCLUDING THOSE HEDGING FOREIGN CURRENCY DENOMINATED FIRM COMMITMENTS.

CHANGES IN FAIR

VALUES OF OUTSTANDING CASH FLOW HEDGE DERIVATIVES, EXCEPT THE INEFFECTIVE PORTION, ARE RECORDED IN OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME, UNTIL NET INCOME IS AFFECTED BY THE VARIABILITY OF CASH FLOWS OF THE HEDGED TRANSACTION. IN MOST CASES AMOUNTS RECORDED IN

OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME WILL BE RELEASED TO NET INCOME SOME TIME AFTER THE MATURITY OF THE RELATED DERIVATIVE. THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF INCOME CLASSIFICATION OF EFFECTIVE HEDGE RESULTS IS THE SAME AS THAT OF THE UNDERLYING EXPOSURE. RESULTS

OF HEDGES OF REVENUE AND PRODUCT COSTS ARE RECORDED IN REVENUE AND COST OF SALES, RESPECTIVELY, WHEN THE UNDERLYING HEDGED TRANSACTION AFFECTS NET INCOME. RESULTS OF HEDGES OF SELLING AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE ARE RECORDED TOGETHER WITH THOSE COSTS

WHEN THE RELATED EXPENSE IS RECORDED. RESULTS OF HEDGES OF ANTICIPATED PURCHASES AND SALES OF U.S. DOLLAR-DENOMINATED AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE SECURITIES ARE RECORDED IN OTHER EXPENSE, NET WHEN THE SECURITIES ARE SOLD. RESULTS OF HEDGES OF ANTICIPATED

INTERCOMPANY TRANSACTIONS ARE RECORDED IN OTHER EXPENSE, NET WHEN THE TRANSACTION OCCURS. HEDGES OF RECORDED BALANCE SHEET POSITIONS ARE RECORDED IN OTHER EXPENSE, NET CURRENTLY TOGETHER WITH THE TRANSACTION GAIN OR LOSS FROM THE HEDGED BALANCE

SHEET POSITION. NET FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSACTION GAINS AND LOSSES, WHICH INCLUDES HEDGE RESULTS CAPTURED IN REVENUES, COST OF SALES, SELLING AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE AND OTHER EXPENSE, NET, WERE A $49.9 MILLION GAIN, A $217.8 MILLION LOSS, AND A

$304.3 MILLION LOSS FOR THE YEARS ENDED MAY 31, 2006, 2005, AND 2004, RESPECTIVELY.

PREMIUMS PAID ON OPTIONS ARE INITIALLY RECORDED

AS DEFERRED CHARGES. THE COMPANY ASSESSES EFFECTIVENESS ON OPTIONS BASED ON THE TOTAL CASH FLOWS METHOD AND RECORDS TOTAL CHANGES IN THE OPTIONS FAIR VALUE TO OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME TO THE DEGREE THEY ARE EFFECTIVE.

AS OF MAY 31, 2006, $39.0 MILLION OF DEFERRED NET LOSSES (NET OF TAX) ON BOTH OUTSTANDING AND MATURED DERIVATIVES ACCUMULATED IN OTHER COMPREHENSIVE

INCOME ARE EXPECTED TO BE RECLASSIFIED TO NET INCOME DURING THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS AS A RESULT OF UNDERLYING HEDGED TRANSACTIONS ALSO BEING RECORDED IN NET INCOME. ACTUAL AMOUNTS ULTIMATELY RECLASSIFIED TO NET INCOME ARE DEPENDENT ON THE EXCHANGE

RATES IN EFFECT WHEN DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS THAT ARE CURRENTLY OUTSTANDING MATURE. AS OF MAY 31, 2006, THE MAXIMUM TERM OVER WHICH THE COMPANY IS HEDGING EXPOSURES TO THE VARIABILITY OF CASH FLOWS FOR ALL FORECASTED AND RECORDED TRANSACTIONS IS

18 MONTHS.

THE COMPANY FORMALLY ASSESSES, BOTH AT A HEDGES INCEPTION AND ON AN ONGOING BASIS, WHETHER THE DERIVATIVES THAT ARE USED

IN THE HEDGING TRANSACTION HAVE BEEN HIGHLY EFFECTIVE IN OFFSETTING CHANGES IN THE CASH

66

TABLE OF CONTENTS

NIKE, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (CONTINUED)

FLOWS OF HEDGED ITEMS AND WHETHER THOSE DERIVATIVES MAY BE EXPECTED TO REMAIN HIGHLY EFFECTIVE IN FUTURE PERIODS. WHEN IT IS DETERMINED THAT A DERIVATIVE IS

NOT, OR HAS CEASED TO BE, HIGHLY EFFECTIVE AS A HEDGE, THE COMPANY DISCONTINUES HEDGE ACCOUNTING PROSPECTIVELY.

THE COMPANY DISCONTINUES

HEDGE ACCOUNTING PROSPECTIVELY WHEN (1) IT DETERMINES THAT THE DERIVATIVE IS NO LONGER HIGHLY EFFECTIVE IN OFFSETTING CHANGES IN THE CASH FLOWS OF A HEDGED ITEM (INCLUDING HEDGED ITEMS SUCH AS FIRM COMMITMENTS OR FORECASTED TRANSACTIONS);

(2) THE DERIVATIVE EXPIRES OR IS SOLD, TERMINATED, OR EXERCISED; (3) IT IS NO LONGER PROBABLE THAT THE FORECASTED TRANSACTION WILL OCCUR; OR (4) MANAGEMENT DETERMINES THAT DESIGNATING THE DERIVATIVE AS A HEDGING INSTRUMENT IS NO

LONGER APPROPRIATE.

WHEN THE COMPANY DISCONTINUES HEDGE ACCOUNTING BECAUSE IT IS NO LONGER PROBABLE THAT THE FORECASTED TRANSACTION WILL

OCCUR IN THE ORIGINALLY EXPECTED PERIOD, THE GAIN OR LOSS ON THE DERIVATIVE REMAINS IN ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME AND IS RECLASSIFIED TO NET INCOME WHEN THE FORECASTED TRANSACTION AFFECTS NET INCOME. HOWEVER, IF IT IS PROBABLE THAT A

FORECASTED TRANSACTION WILL NOT OCCUR BY THE END OF THE ORIGINALLY SPECIFIED TIME PERIOD OR WITHIN AN ADDITIONAL TWO-MONTH PERIOD OF TIME THEREAFTER, THE GAINS AND LOSSES THAT WERE ACCUMULATED IN OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME WILL BE RECOGNIZED

IMMEDIATELY IN NET INCOME. IN ALL SITUATIONS IN WHICH HEDGE ACCOUNTING IS DISCONTINUED AND THE DERIVATIVE REMAINS OUTSTANDING, THE COMPANY WILL CARRY THE DERIVATIVE AT ITS FAIR VALUE ON THE BALANCE SHEET, RECOGNIZING FUTURE CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE

IN OTHER EXPENSE, NET. ANY HEDGE INEFFECTIVENESS IS RECORDED IN OTHER EXPENSE, NET. EFFECTIVENESS FOR CASH FLOW HEDGES IS ASSESSED BASED ON FORWARD RATES.

FOR EACH OF THE YEARS ENDED MAY 31, 2006, 2005 AND 2004, THE COMPANY RECORDED IN OTHER EXPENSE, NET AN INSIGNIFICANT LOSS REPRESENTING THE TOTAL INEFFECTIVENESS OF ALL DERIVATIVES. NET INCOME FOR EACH OF THE

YEARS ENDED MAY 31, 2006, 2005 AND 2004 WAS NOT MATERIALLY AFFECTED DUE TO DISCONTINUED HEDGE ACCOUNTING.

FAIR VALUE HEDGES

THE COMPANY IS ALSO EXPOSED TO THE RISK OF CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF CERTAIN FIXED-RATE DEBT ATTRIBUTABLE TO CHANGES IN INTEREST

RATES. DERIVATIVES CURRENTLY USED BY THE COMPANY TO HEDGE THIS RISK ARE RECEIVE-FIXED, PAY-VARIABLE INTEREST RATE SWAPS.

SUBSTANTIALLY ALL

INTEREST RATE SWAP AGREEMENTS ARE DESIGNATED AS FAIR VALUE HEDGES OF THE RELATED LONG-TERM DEBT AND MEET THE SHORTCUT METHOD REQUIREMENTS UNDER FAS 133. ACCORDINGLY, CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUES OF THE INTEREST RATE SWAP AGREEMENTS ARE EXACTLY OFFSET

BY CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE UNDERLYING LONG-TERM DEBT. NO INEFFECTIVENESS HAS BEEN RECORDED TO NET INCOME RELATED TO INTEREST RATE SWAPS DESIGNATED AS FAIR VALUE HEDGES FOR THE YEARS ENDED MAY 31, 2006, 2005 AND 2004.

AS DISCUSSED IN NOTE 7, DURING THE YEAR ENDED MAY 31, 2004, THE COMPANY ISSUED A $50 MILLION MEDIUM-TERM NOTE MATURING OCTOBER 1, 2013 AND

SIMULTANEOUSLY ENTERED INTO A RECEIVE-FIXED, PAY-VARIABLE INTEREST RATE SWAP WITH THE SAME NOTIONAL AMOUNT AND FIXED INTEREST RATE AS THE NOTE. HOWEVER, THE SWAP EXPIRES OCTOBER 2, 2006. THIS INTEREST RATE SWAP IS NOT ACCOUNTED FOR AS A FAIR

VALUE HEDGE, ACCORDINGLY CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE SWAP ARE RECORDED TO NET INCOME EACH PERIOD AS A COMPONENT OF OTHER EXPENSE, NET. THE CHANGE IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE SWAP WAS NOT MATERIAL FOR THE YEARS ENDED MAY 31, 2006, 2005 AND

2004.

IN FISCAL 2003, THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO AN INTEREST RATE SWAP AGREEMENT RELATED TO A JAPANESE YEN DENOMINATED INTERCOMPANY LOAN

WITH ONE OF THE COMPANYS JAPANESE SUBSIDIARIES. THE JAPANESE SUBSIDIARY PAYS VARIABLE INTEREST ON THE INTERCOMPANY LOAN BASED ON 3-MONTH LIBOR PLUS A SPREAD. UNDER THE INTEREST RATE SWAP AGREEMENT, THE SUBSIDIARY PAYS FIXED INTEREST PAYMENTS

AT 0.8% AND RECEIVES VARIABLE INTEREST PAYMENTS BASED ON 3-MONTH LIBOR PLUS A SPREAD BASED ON A NOTIONAL AMOUNT OF 8 BILLION JAPANESE YEN. THIS INTEREST RATE SWAP IS NOT ACCOUNTED FOR AS A FAIR VALUE HEDGE, ACCORDINGLY CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF

THE SWAP ARE RECORDED TO NET INCOME EACH PERIOD AS A COMPONENT OF OTHER EXPENSE, NET. THE CHANGE IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE SWAP WAS NOT MATERIAL FOR THE YEARS ENDED MAY 31, 2006, 2005 AND 2004.

CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK

THE COMPANY IS EXPOSED TO CREDIT-RELATED LOSSES IN THE EVENT OF NON-PERFORMANCE BY COUNTERPARTIES TO HEDGING INSTRUMENTS. THE COUNTERPARTIES TO ALL

DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS ARE MAJOR FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS WITH INVESTMENT GRADE CREDIT RATINGS. HOWEVER, THIS DOES NOT ELIMINATE THE COMPANYS EXPOSURE TO CREDIT RISK WITH THESE INSTITUTIONS. THIS CREDIT RISK IS GENERALLY LIMITED TO THE

UNREALIZED GAINS IN SUCH CONTRACTS SHOULD ANY OF THESE COUNTERPARTIES FAIL TO PERFORM AS CONTRACTED. TO MANAGE THIS RISK, THE COMPANY HAS ESTABLISHED STRICT COUNTERPARTY CREDIT GUIDELINES THAT ARE CONTINUALLY MONITORED AND REPORTED TO SENIOR

MANAGEMENT ACCORDING TO PRESCRIBED GUIDELINES. THE COMPANY UTILIZES A PORTFOLIO OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS EITHER HEADQUARTERED OR OPERATING IN THE SAME COUNTRIES THE COMPANY CONDUCTS ITS BUSINESS. AS A RESULT OF THE ABOVE CONSIDERATIONS, THE COMPANY

CONSIDERS THE RISK OF COUNTERPARTY DEFAULT TO BE MINIMAL.

IN ADDITION TO HEDGING INSTRUMENTS, THE COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO CONCENTRATIONS OF

CREDIT RISK ASSOCIATED WITH CASH AND EQUIVALENTS AND ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE. THE COMPANY PLACES CASH AND EQUIVALENTS WITH FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS WITH INVESTMENT GRADE CREDIT RATINGS AND, BY POLICY, LIMITS THE AMOUNT OF CREDIT EXPOSURE TO ANY ONE

FINANCIAL INSTITUTION. THE COMPANY CONSIDERS ITS CONCENTRATION RISK RELATED TO ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE TO BE MITIGATED BY THE COMPANYS CREDIT POLICY, THE SIGNIFICANCE OF OUTSTANDING BALANCES OWED BY EACH INDIVIDUAL CUSTOMER AT ANY POINT IN TIME

AND THE GEOGRAPHIC DISPERSION OF THESE CUSTOMERS.

NOTE 17  OPERATING SEGMENTS AND RELATED INFORMATION

OPERATING SEGMENTS.

THE COMPANYS OPERATING SEGMENTS ARE EVIDENCE OF THE STRUCTURE OF THE COMPANYS INTERNAL

ORGANIZATION. THE MAJOR SEGMENTS ARE DEFINED BY GEOGRAPHIC REGIONS FOR OPERATIONS PARTICIPATING IN NIKE BRAND SALES ACTIVITY EXCLUDING NIKE GOLF AND NIKE BAUER HOCKEY. EACH NIKE BRAND GEOGRAPHIC SEGMENT OPERATES PREDOMINANTLY IN ONE INDUSTRY: THE

DESIGN, PRODUCTION, MARKETING AND SELLING OF SPORTS AND FITNESS FOOTWEAR, APPAREL, AND EQUIPMENT. THE OTHER CATEGORY SHOWN BELOW REPRESENTS ACTIVITIES OF COLE HAAN, CONVERSE (BEGINNING SEPTEMBER 4, 2003), EXETER BRANDS GROUP

(BEGINNING AUGUST 11, 2004), HURLEY, NIKE BAUER HOCKEY, AND NIKE GOLF, WHICH ARE CONSIDERED IMMATERIAL FOR INDIVIDUAL DISCLOSURE BASED ON THE AGGREGATION CRITERIA IN SFAS NO. 131 DISCLOSURES ABOUT SEGMENTS OF AN ENTERPRISE AND

RELATED INFORMATION.

WHERE APPLICABLE, CORPORATE REPRESENTS ITEMS NECESSARY TO RECONCILE TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS, WHICH GENERALLY INCLUDE CORPORATE ACTIVITY AND CORPORATE ELIMINATIONS.

NET REVENUES AS SHOWN BELOW REPRESENT SALES TO EXTERNAL

CUSTOMERS FOR EACH SEGMENT. INTERCOMPANY REVENUES HAVE BEEN ELIMINATED AND ARE IMMATERIAL FOR SEPARATE DISCLOSURE. THE COMPANY EVALUATES PERFORMANCE OF INDIVIDUAL OPERATING SEGMENTS BASED ON PRE-TAX INCOME. ON A CONSOLIDATED BASIS, THIS AMOUNT

REPRESENTS INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES AS SHOWN IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME. RECONCILING ITEMS FOR PRE-TAX
