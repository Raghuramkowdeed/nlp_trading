SALES AND MARKETING

FINANCIAL INFORMATION ABOUT GEOGRAPHIC AND SEGMENT OPERATIONS

APPEARS IN NOTE 17 OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

ON PAGE 60.

WE EXPERIENCE MODERATE FLUCTUATIONS IN AGGREGATE SALES VOLUME

DURING THE YEAR. HISTORICALLY, REVENUES IN THE FIRST AND FOURTH

FISCAL QUARTERS HAVE SLIGHTLY EXCEEDED THOSE IN THE SECOND AND

THIRD QUARTERS. HOWEVER, THE MIX OF PRODUCT SALES MAY VARY

CONSIDERABLY FROM TIME TO TIME AS A RESULT OF CHANGES IN

SEASONAL AND GEOGRAPHIC DEMAND FOR PARTICULAR TYPES OF FOOTWEAR,

APPAREL AND EQUIPMENT.

BECAUSE NIKE IS A CONSUMER PRODUCTS COMPANY, THE RELATIVE

POPULARITY OF VARIOUS SPORTS AND FITNESS ACTIVITIES AND CHANGING

DESIGN TRENDS AFFECT THE DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS. WE MUST

THEREFORE RESPOND TO TRENDS AND SHIFTS IN CONSUMER PREFERENCES

BY ADJUSTING THE MIX OF EXISTING PRODUCT OFFERINGS, DEVELOPING

NEW PRODUCTS, STYLES AND CATEGORIES, AND INFLUENCING SPORTS AND

FITNESS PREFERENCES THROUGH AGGRESSIVE MARKETING. THIS IS A

CONTINUING RISK. FAILURE TO RESPOND IN A TIMELY AND ADEQUATE

MANNER COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR SALES AND

PROFITABILITY.

UNITED STATES MARKET

IN FISCAL 2005, SALES IN THE UNITED STATES (INCLUDING

U.S. SALES OF BAUER NIKE HOCKEY, COLE HAAN, CONVERSE,

EXETER BRANDS GROUP, HURLEY AND NIKE GOLF) ACCOUNTED FOR

APPROXIMATELY 46 PERCENT OF TOTAL REVENUES, COMPARED TO

47 PERCENT IN FISCAL 2004 AND 49 PERCENT IN FISCAL

2003. WE SELL TO APPROXIMATELY 22,000 RETAIL ACCOUNTS IN THE

UNITED STATES. THE NIKE BRAND DOMESTIC RETAIL ACCOUNT BASE

INCLUDES A MIX OF FOOTWEAR STORES, SPORTING GOODS STORES,

ATHLETIC SPECIALTY STORES, DEPARTMENT STORES, SKATE, TENNIS AND

GOLF SHOPS, AND OTHER RETAIL ACCOUNTS. DURING FISCAL YEAR 2005,

OUR THREE LARGEST CUSTOMERS ACCOUNTED FOR APPROXIMATELY

31 PERCENT OF NIKE BRAND SALES IN THE UNITED STATES

EXCLUDING SALES FROM NIKE GOLF AND BAUER NIKE HOCKEY, AND

26 PERCENT OF TOTAL SALES IN THE UNITED STATES.

WE MAKE SUBSTANTIAL USE OF OUR FUTURES ORDERING

PROGRAM, WHICH ALLOWS RETAILERS TO ORDER FIVE TO SIX MONTHS IN

ADVANCE OF DELIVERY WITH THE COMMITMENT THAT 90 PERCENT OF

THEIR ORDERS WILL BE DELIVERED WITHIN A SET TIME PERIOD AT A

FIXED PRICE. IN FISCAL YEAR 2005, 91 PERCENT OF OUR

U.S. WHOLESALE FOOTWEAR SHIPMENTS (EXCLUDING BAUER NIKE

HOCKEY, COLE HAAN, CONVERSE, EXETER BRANDS GROUP, HURLEY AND

NIKE GOLF) WERE MADE UNDER THE FUTURES PROGRAM, COMPARED TO

90 PERCENT IN FISCAL 2004 AND 91 PERCENT IN FISCAL

2003. IN FISCAL 2005 AND 2004, 71 PERCENT OF OUR

U.S. WHOLESALE APPAREL SHIPMENTS (EXCLUDING

U.S. LICENSED TEAM APPAREL, BAUER NIKE HOCKEY, COLE HAAN,

CONVERSE, EXETER BRANDS GROUP, HURLEY AND NIKE GOLF) WERE MADE

UNDER THE FUTURES PROGRAM, COMPARED TO 67 PERCENT IN 2004

TABLE OF CONTENTS

ORDERS

WORLDWIDE FUTURES ORDERS FOR NIKE BRAND ATHLETIC FOOTWEAR AND

APPAREL, SCHEDULED FOR DELIVERY FROM JUNE THROUGH NOVEMBER 2005,

WERE $6.3 BILLION COMPARED TO $5.7 BILLION FOR THE

SAME PERIOD LAST YEAR. BASED UPON HISTORICAL DATA, WE EXPECT

THAT APPROXIMATELY 95 PERCENT OF THESE ORDERS WILL BE

FILLED IN THAT TIME PERIOD, ALTHOUGH SOME ORDERS MAY BE

CANCELLED. REPORTED FUTURES ORDERS ARE NOT NECESSARILY

INDICATIVE OF OUR EXPECTATION OF REVENUES FOR THIS PERIOD. THIS

IS BECAUSE THE MIX OF ORDERS CAN SHIFT BETWEEN ADVANCE/FUTURES

AND AT-ONCE ORDERS. IN ADDITION, FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE

FLUCTUATIONS AS WELL AS DIFFERING LEVELS OF ORDER CANCELLATIONS

CAN CAUSE DIFFERENCES IN THE COMPARISONS BETWEEN FUTURES ORDERS

AND ACTUAL REVENUES. MOREOVER, A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR

REVENUE IS NOT DERIVED FROM FUTURES ORDERS, INCLUDING WHOLESALE

SALES OF EQUIPMENT, U.S. LICENSED TEAM APPAREL, BAUER NIKE

HOCKEY, COLE HAAN, CONVERSE, EXETER BRANDS GROUP, HURLEY, NIKE

GOLF, AND RETAIL SALES ACROSS ALL BRANDS.

PRODUCT RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

WE BELIEVE THAT OUR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS ARE A KEY

FACTOR IN OUR PAST AND FUTURE SUCCESS. TECHNICAL INNOVATION IN

THE DESIGN OF FOOTWEAR, APPAREL, AND ATHLETIC EQUIPMENT RECEIVE

CONTINUED EMPHASIS AS NIKE STRIVES TO PRODUCE PRODUCTS THAT HELP

TO REDUCE INJURY, AID ATHLETIC PERFORMANCE AND MAXIMIZE COMFORT.

IN ADDITION TO NIKES OWN STAFF OF SPECIALISTS IN THE AREAS

OF BIOMECHANICS, EXERCISE PHYSIOLOGY, ENGINEERING, INDUSTRIAL

DESIGN AND RELATED FIELDS, WE ALSO UTILIZE RESEARCH COMMITTEES

AND ADVISORY BOARDS MADE UP OF ATHLETES, COACHES, TRAINERS,

EQUIPMENT MANAGERS, ORTHOPEDISTS, PODIATRISTS AND OTHER EXPERTS

WHO CONSULT WITH US AND REVIEW DESIGNS, MATERIALS AND CONCEPTS

FOR PRODUCT IMPROVEMENT. EMPLOYEE ATHLETES AND OTHER ATHLETES

WEAR-TEST AND EVALUATE PRODUCTS DURING THE DESIGN AND

DEVELOPMENT PROCESS.

MANUFACTURING

VIRTUALLY ALL OF OUR FOOTWEAR IS PRODUCED OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED

STATES. IN FISCAL 2005, CONTRACT SUPPLIERS IN CHINA, VIETNAM,

INDONESIA AND THAILAND MANUFACTURED 36 PERCENT,

26 PERCENT, 22 PERCENT AND 15 PERCENT OF TOTAL

NIKE BRAND FOOTWEAR, RESPECTIVELY. WE ALSO HAVE MANUFACTURING

AGREEMENTS WITH INDEPENDENT FACTORIES IN ARGENTINA, BRAZIL,

INDIA, ITALY, MEXICO AND SOUTH AFRICA TO MANUFACTURE FOOTWEAR

FOR SALE PRIMARILY WITHIN THOSE COUNTRIES. OUR LARGEST SINGLE

FOOTWEAR SUPPLIER ACCOUNTED FOR APPROXIMATELY 7 PERCENT OF

TOTAL FISCAL 2005 FOOTWEAR PRODUCTION.

ALMOST ALL OF NIKE BRAND APPAREL PRODUCTION FOR SALE TO THE

UNITED STATES MARKET, AND ALL OF OUR APPAREL PRODUCTION FOR SALE

TO THE INTERNATIONAL MARKET, WAS MANUFACTURED OUTSIDE OF THE

UNITED STATES BY INDEPENDENT CONTRACT MANUFACTURERS LOCATED IN

38 COUNTRIES. MOST OF THIS APPAREL PRODUCTION OCCURRED IN

BANGLADESH, CHINA, HONDURAS, INDIA, INDONESIA, MALAYSIA, MEXICO,

PAKISTAN, SRI LANKA, TAIWAN, THAILAND, TURKEY AND VIETNAM. OUR

LARGEST SINGLE APPAREL SUPPLIER ACCOUNTED FOR APPROXIMATELY

5 PERCENT OF TOTAL FISCAL 2005 APPAREL PRODUCTION.

THE PRINCIPAL MATERIALS USED IN OUR FOOTWEAR PRODUCTS ARE

NATURAL AND SYNTHETIC RUBBER, PLASTIC COMPOUNDS, FOAM CUSHIONING

MATERIALS, NYLON, LEATHER, CANVAS AND POLYURETHANE FILMS USED TO

MAKE AIR-SOLE CUSHIONING COMPONENTS. NIKE IHM, INC., A

WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARY OF NIKE, IS OUR SOLE SUPPLIER OF THE

AIR-SOLE CUSHIONING COMPONENTS USED IN FOOTWEAR. THE PRINCIPAL

MATERIALS USED IN OUR APPAREL PRODUCTS ARE NATURAL AND SYNTHETIC

FABRICS AND THREADS, PLASTIC AND METAL HARDWARE, AND SPECIALIZED

PERFORMANCE FABRICS DESIGNED TO REPEL RAIN, RETAIN HEAT, OR

EFFICIENTLY TRANSPORT BODY MOISTURE. NIKE AND ITS CONTRACTORS

AND SUPPLIERS BUY RAW MATERIALS IN BULK. MOST RAW MATERIALS ARE

AVAILABLE IN THE COUNTRIES WHERE MANUFACTURING TAKES PLACE. WE

HAVE THUS FAR EXPERIENCED LITTLE DIFFICULTY IN SATISFYING OUR

RAW MATERIAL REQUIREMENTS.

SINCE 1972, SOJITZ CORPORATION OF AMERICA (SOJITZ

AMERICA) AND ITS PREDECESSOR, NISSHO IWAI AMERICAN

CORPORATION, A SUBSIDIARY OF NISSHO IWAI CORPORATION, A LARGE

JAPANESE TRADING COMPANY, HAVE PERFORMED SIGNIFICANT

IMPORT-EXPORT FINANCING SERVICES FOR US. DURING FISCAL 2005,

SOJITZ AMERICA PROVIDED SUCH FINANCING SERVICES FOR NEARLY ALL

OF THE NIKE BRAND PRODUCTS SOLD OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES,

EUROPE, MIDDLE EAST, AFRICA AND JAPAN, EXCLUDING PRODUCTS

PRODUCED AND SOLD IN THE SAME COUNTRY. HOWEVER, LESS

5

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THAN 11 PERCENT OF NIKE BRAND PRODUCTS, EXCLUDING PRODUCTS

PRODUCED AND SOLD IN THE SAME COUNTRY, WERE SOLD OUTSIDE OF THE

UNITED STATES, EUROPE, MIDDLE EAST, AFRICA AND JAPAN IN FISCAL

2005. ANY FAILURE OF SOJITZ AMERICA TO PROVIDE THESE SERVICES OR

ANY FAILURE OF SOJITZ AMERICAS BANKS COULD DISRUPT OUR

ABILITY TO ACQUIRE PRODUCTS FROM OUR SUPPLIERS AND TO DELIVER

PRODUCTS TO OUR CUSTOMERS OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES, EUROPE,

MIDDLE EAST, AFRICA AND JAPAN. SUCH A DISRUPTION COULD RESULT IN

CANCELLED ORDERS THAT WOULD ADVERSELY AFFECT SALES AND

PROFITABILITY. HOWEVER, WE BELIEVE THAT ANY SUCH DISRUPTION

WOULD BE SHORT TERM IN DURATION DUE TO THE READY AVAILABILITY OF

ALTERNATIVE SOURCES OF FINANCING AT COMPETITIVE RATES. OUR

CURRENT AGREEMENTS WITH SOJITZ AMERICA EXPIRE ON MAY 31,

2008.

INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS AND TRADE

OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS AND SOURCES OF SUPPLY ARE SUBJECT

TO THE USUAL RISKS OF DOING BUSINESS ABROAD, SUCH AS POSSIBLE

REVALUATION OF CURRENCIES, EXPORT DUTIES, ANTI-DUMPING DUTIES,

QUOTAS, SAFEGUARD MEASURES, TRADE RESTRICTIONS, RESTRICTIONS ON

THE TRANSFER OF FUNDS AND, IN CERTAIN PARTS OF THE WORLD,

POLITICAL INSTABILITY AND TERRORISM. WE HAVE NOT, TO DATE, BEEN

MATERIALLY AFFECTED BY ANY SUCH RISK, BUT CANNOT PREDICT THE

LIKELIHOOD OF SUCH DEVELOPMENTS OCCURRING. WE BELIEVE THAT WE

HAVE THE ABILITY TO DEVELOP, OVER A PERIOD OF TIME, ADEQUATE

ALTERNATIVE SOURCES OF SUPPLY FOR THE PRODUCTS OBTAINED FROM OUR

PRESENT SUPPLIERS OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES. IF EVENTS

PREVENTED US FROM ACQUIRING PRODUCTS FROM OUR SUPPLIERS IN A

PARTICULAR COUNTRY, OUR OPERATIONS COULD BE TEMPORARILY

DISRUPTED AND WE COULD EXPERIENCE AN ADVERSE FINANCIAL IMPACT.

HOWEVER, WE BELIEVE THAT WE COULD ABATE ANY SUCH DISRUPTION

WITHIN A PERIOD OF NO MORE THAN 12 MONTHS, AND THAT MUCH OF

THE ADVERSE IMPACT ON SUPPLY WOULD, THEREFORE, BE OF A

SHORT-TERM NATURE. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR PRINCIPAL COMPETITORS ARE

SUBJECT TO SIMILAR RISKS.

AS A RESULT OF THE TRADE ACT OF 2003, THE UNITED STATES

IMPLEMENTED SIGNIFICANT NEW FEDERAL REQUIREMENTS FOR CARGO

SECURITY, FOCUSED ON IMPORTS OF CONTAINERIZED CARGO. WE ARE A

SIGNIFICANT IMPORTER OF CONTAINERIZED CARGO. ACCORDINGLY, WE

PARTICIPATE ACTIVELY IN APPROPRIATE GOVERNMENTAL PROGRAMS, SUCH

AS THE CUSTOMS TRADE PARTNERSHIP AGAINST TERRORISM

(C-TPAT), TO REDUCE RISKS OF POSSIBLE SUPPLY

DISRUPTIONS CAUSED BY U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL CARGO SECURITY

MANDATES AND TERRORISM.

ALL OF OUR PRODUCTS MANUFACTURED OVERSEAS AND IMPORTED INTO THE

UNITED STATES, THE EUROPEAN UNION AND OTHER COUNTRIES ARE

SUBJECT TO CUSTOMS DUTIES COLLECTED BY CUSTOMS AUTHORITIES.

CUSTOMS INFORMATION SUBMITTED BY US IS ROUTINELY SUBJECT TO

REVIEW BY CUSTOMS AUTHORITIES. WE ARE UNABLE TO PREDICT WHETHER

ADDITIONAL CUSTOMS DUTIES, ANTI-DUMPING DUTIES, QUOTAS,

SAFEGUARD MEASURES, OR OTHER TRADE RESTRICTIONS MAY BE IMPOSED

ON THE IMPORTATION OF OUR PRODUCTS IN THE FUTURE. SUCH ACTIONS

COULD RESULT IN INCREASES IN THE COST OF OUR PRODUCTS GENERALLY

AND MIGHT ADVERSELY AFFECT THE SALES OR PROFITABILITY OF NIKE

AND THE IMPORTED FOOTWEAR AND APPAREL INDUSTRY AS A WHOLE.

ACCORDINGLY, WE ARE ACTIVELY MONITORING THE DEVELOPMENTS

DESCRIBED BELOW.

FOOTWEAR IMPORTS INTO THE EUROPEAN UNION

FROM 1994 THROUGH JANUARY 1, 2005, THE EUROPEAN UNION

(EU) IMPOSED LIMITS (OR QUOTAS) ON THE

IMPORT OF CERTAIN TYPES OF FOOTWEAR MANUFACTURED IN CHINA.

FOOTWEAR DESIGNED FOR USE IN SPORTING ACTIVITIES, MEETING

CERTAIN TECHNICAL CRITERIA AND HAVING A CIF (COST, INSURANCE AND

FREIGHT) PRICE ABOVE 9 EUROS (SPECIAL TECHNOLOGY ATHLETIC

FOOTWEAR OR STAF), WAS EXCLUDED FROM THE

QUOTAS. AS A RESULT OF THE STAF EXCLUSION, AND THE AMOUNT OF

QUOTA MADE AVAILABLE TO US, THE QUOTAS DID NOT HAVE A MATERIAL

EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS. HOWEVER, AS PART OF CHINAS 2001

ACCESSION TO THE WORLD TRADE ORGANIZATION (WTO),

CHINA ENTERED INTO AN AGREEMENT WITH THE EU AND OTHER WTO

MEMBERS TO ABIDE BY A SPECIAL SAFEGUARD ARRANGEMENT WHEREBY

QUOTAS COULD BE IMPOSED ON ANY PRODUCT SOURCED IN CHINA,

INCLUDING FOOTWEAR, IF THERE WAS A SURGE IN IMPORTS FROM CHINA

INTO ANOTHER WTO COUNTRY, AND AFTER A LEGAL PROCEEDING IT WAS

DETERMINED THAT SUCH IMPORTS WERE INJURING A DOMESTIC PRODUCER.

ADDITIONALLY, UNDER LONGSTANDING WTO RULES, ALL WTO MEMBER

COUNTRIES RESERVED THE RIGHT TO IMPOSE (1) SAFEGUARD

MEASURES (TEMPORARY QUOTAS) IF IT CAN BE DEMONSTRATED IN A LEGAL

PROCEEDING THAT INCREASED IMPORTS ARE INJURING ANOTHER WTO

MEMBERS DOMESTIC INDUSTRY; AND (2) ANTI-DUMPING

MEASURES IF IT CAN BE DEMONSTRATED IN A LEGAL PROCEEDING THAT

IMPORTS ARE BEING SOLD AT AN UNFAIR LOW PRICE IN ANOTHER WTO

MEMBERS HOME MARKET, AND THOSE IMPORTS WERE CAUSING OR

THREATENING TO CAUSE MATERIAL INJURY TO THE DOMESTIC INDUSTRY.

6

TABLE OF CONTENTS

ACCORDINGLY, WITH THE PHASE-OUT OF THE QUOTAS AT THE BEGINNING

OF 2005, AND THE EXPIRATION OF A SEPARATE EU ANTI-DUMPING CASE

IN 2003 AGAINST FOOTWEAR MADE IN CHINA, INDONESIA, AND THAILAND,

THERE HAS BEEN RENEWED PRESSURE FROM SOME PARTS OF THE EU

FOOTWEAR MANUFACTURING SECTOR TO RE-IMPOSE SOME LEVEL OF TRADE

PROTECTION ON IMPORTED FOOTWEAR FROM CHINA, INDIA, VIETNAM, AND

OTHER EXPORTING COUNTRIES. IN MID-2005 THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,

AT THE REQUEST OF THE EUROPEAN DOMESTIC FOOTWEAR INDUSTRY,

INITIATED INVESTIGATIONS INTO LEATHER FOOTWEAR IMPORTED FROM

CHINA AND VIETNAM. NIKE AND ALL OTHER MAJOR ATHLETIC FOOTWEAR

MANUFACTURERS ARE CURRENTLY PARTICIPATING ACTIVELY AS

RESPONDENTS IN THIS INVESTIGATION AND ARE TAKING THE POSITION

THAT ATHLETIC FOOTWEAR (I) SHOULD NOT BE WITHIN THE PRODUCT

SCOPE OF THIS INVESTIGATION AND (II) DOES NOT MEET THE

LEGAL REQUIREMENTS OF INJURY AND PRICE IN AN ANTI-DUMPING

INVESTIGATION. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR MAJOR COMPETITORS STAND IN

MUCH THE SAME POSITION OF RISK REGARDING THESE POTENTIAL TRADE

MEASURES.

EXPIRATION OF THE TEXTILE AND APPAREL MULTI-FIBER

ARRANGEMENT

UNDER THE WTO, THE MULTI-FIBER ARRANGEMENT, A FOUR-DECADE OLD

AGREEMENT THAT ALLOWS WTO COUNTRIES TO IMPOSE QUOTAS ON THE

IMPORT OF TEXTILE AND APPAREL PRODUCTS, EXPIRED ON

JANUARY 1, 2005. THIS EFFECTIVELY MEANT THAT ABSENT SOME

OTHER FORM OF TRADE RESTRICTIONS (SEE CHINA DISCUSSION BELOW)

ALL TRADE OF TEXTILE AND APPAREL PRODUCTS BETWEEN WTO MEMBERS IS

FREE FROM QUOTAS AS OF THE END OF THE 2004 CALENDAR YEAR.

ELIMINATION OF TEXTILE AND APPAREL QUOTAS IS SIGNIFICANT FOR

NIKE AND OTHER TEXTILE AND APPAREL COMPANIES AS IT PROVIDES

THESE COMPANIES GREATER FLEXIBILITY IN THEIR GLOBAL SOURCING

DECISIONS. AT THE SAME TIME, WE ARE MONITORING CLOSELY ACTIONS

BY TEXTILE AND APPAREL IMPORTING COUNTRIES TO ENSURE THAT THEY

DO NOT UNILATERALLY ATTEMPT TO RE-IMPOSE RESTRICTIONS THROUGH

SOME OTHER LEGAL MECHANISM, SUCH AS SAFEGUARDS, ANTI-DUMPING

MEASURES, OR IN THE CASE OF CHINA (AS PART OF THE AGREEMENT

REACHED IN CHINAS 2001 WTO ACCESSION), THROUGH THE

SHORT-TERM RE-IMPOSITION OF QUOTAS ON CERTAIN CATEGORIES OF

TEXTILE AND APPAREL PRODUCTS IN ORDER TO PROTECT A DOMESTIC

MARKET FROM RISING CHINESE IMPORTS.

WE ARE CURRENTLY MONITORING POTENTIAL RESTRICTIONS BY THE UNITED

STATES AND THE EUROPEAN UNION. IN EARLY 2005 THE EU BEGAN

CONSULTATIONS WITH CHINA OVER IMPOSITION OF QUOTAS. HOWEVER, AS

A RESULT OF THOSE NEGOTIATIONS, IN JUNE OF 2005, THE EU AND

CHINA REACHED AN AGREEMENT WHICH VOLUNTARILY LIMITS THE AMOUNT

OF APPAREL PRODUCT CHINA CAN EXPORT TO THE EU IN PARTICULAR

CATEGORIES UNTIL JANUARY 1, 2008. NIKE MONITORED THESE

NEGOTIATIONS CLOSELY, ADJUSTED ITS SOURCING AND DISTRIBUTION

STRATEGY, AND AS A RESULT, THE AGREEMENT HAS NOT HAD A MATERIAL

EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS.

IN EARLY 2005 THE UNITED STATES LAUNCHED PROVISIONAL SAFEGUARD

MEASURES ON SEVERAL CATEGORIES OF APPAREL PRODUCTS FROM CHINA.

IN MAY OF 2005, THE U.S. FOUND THAT IMPORTS FROM CHINA OF

CERTAIN APPAREL CATEGORIES WERE CAUSING MARKET DISRUPTION TO THE

U.S. INDUSTRY AND THE UNITED STATES REIMPOSED QUOTA ON

CERTAIN APPAREL CATEGORIES. NIKE MONITORED THESE NEGOTIATIONS

CLOSELY, ADJUSTED ITS SOURCING AND DISTRIBUTION STRATEGY, AND AS

A RESULT, THE ACTIONS HAVE NOT HAD A MATERIAL EFFECT ON OUR

BUSINESS. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR PRINCIPAL COMPETITORS FACE THE

SAME RISKS REGARDING THESE TRADE MEASURES.

VIETNAM IMPORTS INTO THE UNITED STATES

WE CURRENTLY SOURCE A PORTION OF OUR FOOTWEAR AND APPAREL

PRODUCTS FROM FACTORIES IN VIETNAM. IN 2001, THE UNITED STATES

CONGRESS AND THE VIETNAMESE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY APPROVED A

COMPREHENSIVE BILATERAL TRADE AGREEMENT, WHICH, AMONG OTHER

THINGS, PROVIDES RECIPROCAL, NON-DISCRIMINATORY NORMAL TRADE

RELATIONS (NTR) BETWEEN THE U.S. AND VIETNAM.

FOLLOWING THAT APPROVAL, THE U.S. GRANTED AN ANNUAL

EXTENSION OF NTR TO VIETNAM. THE U.S. PRESIDENT MUST RENEW

THIS GRANT ANNUALLY WITH THE OPPORTUNITY FOR REVIEW BY CONGRESS.

IN JUNE 2005, PRESIDENT BUSH RENEWED NTR FOR VIETNAM FOR AN

ADDITIONAL YEAR AND WE ANTICIPATE CONGRESS WILL SUPPORT THIS

DECISION, AS IT HAS DONE FOR THE PAST FOUR YEARS. WE CURRENTLY

BELIEVE THAT, ABSENT UNFORESEEN CIRCUMSTANCES, THE PRESIDENT

WILL CONTINUE HIS ANNUAL EXTENSIONS OF NTR TO VIETNAM AND THAT

CONGRESS WILL SUPPORT THE PRESIDENTS DECISIONS. THE ANNUAL

EXTENSIONS ON NTR WILL REMAIN IN PLACE UNTIL VIETNAM ENTERS THE

WTO, AT WHICH TIME THE U.S. MUST GRANT VIETNAM PERMANENT

NTR. VIETNAMS WTO ACCESSION NEGOTIATIONS ARE ONGOING, AND

MAY CONCLUDE AS EARLY AS THE END OF 2005. ONGOING NTR TRADING

STATUS FOR VIETNAM WILL ALLOW US TO EXPAND OUR PRODUCTION AND

MARKETING OPPORTUNITIES IN VIETNAM AND ALLOW FOR

VIETNAMESE-SOURCED PRODUCT TO CONTINUE TO ENTER THE UNITED

STATES AT NTR TARIFF RATES.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

COMPETITION

THE ATHLETIC FOOTWEAR, APPAREL AND EQUIPMENT INDUSTRY IS KEENLY

COMPETITIVE IN THE UNITED STATES AND ON A WORLDWIDE BASIS. WE

COMPETE INTERNATIONALLY WITH AN INCREASING NUMBER OF ATHLETIC

AND LEISURE SHOE COMPANIES, ATHLETIC AND LEISURE APPAREL

COMPANIES, SPORTS EQUIPMENT COMPANIES, AND LARGE COMPANIES

HAVING DIVERSIFIED LINES OF ATHLETIC AND LEISURE SHOES, APPAREL

AND EQUIPMENT, INCLUDING REEBOK, ADIDAS AND OTHERS. THE INTENSE

COMPETITION AND THE RAPID CHANGES IN TECHNOLOGY AND CONSUMER

PREFERENCES IN THE MARKETS FOR ATHLETIC AND LEISURE FOOTWEAR AND

APPAREL, AND ATHLETIC EQUIPMENT, CONSTITUTE SIGNIFICANT RISK

FACTORS IN OUR OPERATIONS.

NIKE IS THE LARGEST SELLER OF ATHLETIC FOOTWEAR AND ATHLETIC

APPAREL IN THE WORLD. PERFORMANCE AND RELIABILITY OF SHOES,

APPAREL, AND EQUIPMENT, NEW PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT, PRICE, PRODUCT

IDENTITY THROUGH MARKETING AND PROMOTION, AND CUSTOMER SUPPORT

AND SERVICE ARE IMPORTANT ASPECTS OF COMPETITION IN THE ATHLETIC

FOOTWEAR, APPAREL AND EQUIPMENT INDUSTRY. TO HELP MARKET OUR

PRODUCTS, WE CONTRACT WITH PROMINENT AND INFLUENTIAL ATHLETES,

COACHES, TEAMS, COLLEGES AND SPORTS LEAGUES TO ENDORSE OUR

BRANDS AND USE OUR PRODUCTS, AND WE ACTIVELY SPONSOR SPORTING

EVENTS AND CLINICS. WE BELIEVE THAT WE ARE COMPETITIVE IN ALL OF

THESE AREAS.

TRADEMARKS AND PATENTS

WE UTILIZE TRADEMARKS ON NEARLY ALL OF OUR PRODUCTS AND BELIEVE

THAT HAVING DISTINCTIVE MARKS THAT ARE READILY IDENTIFIABLE IS

AN IMPORTANT FACTOR IN CREATING A MARKET FOR OUR GOODS, IN

IDENTIFYING THE COMPANY, AND IN DISTINGUISHING OUR GOODS FROM

THE GOODS OF OTHERS. WE CONSIDER OUR NIKE® AND SWOOSH

DESIGN® TRADEMARKS TO BE AMONG OUR MOST VALUABLE ASSETS AND

WE HAVE REGISTERED THESE TRADEMARKS IN OVER 100 COUNTRIES.

IN ADDITION, WE OWN MANY OTHER TRADEMARKS THAT WE UTILIZE IN

MARKETING OUR PRODUCTS. WE CONTINUE TO VIGOROUSLY PROTECT OUR

TRADEMARKS AGAINST INFRINGEMENT.

NIKE HAS AN EXCLUSIVE, WORLDWIDE LICENSE TO MAKE AND SELL

FOOTWEAR USING PATENTED AIR TECHNOLOGY. THE PROCESS

UTILIZES PRESSURIZED GAS ENCAPSULATED IN POLYURETHANE. SOME OF

THE EARLY NIKE AIR® PATENTS HAVE EXPIRED, WHICH MAY ENABLE

COMPETITORS TO USE CERTAIN TYPES OF SIMILAR TECHNOLOGY.

SUBSEQUENT NIKE AIR PATENTS WILL NOT EXPIRE FOR SEVERAL YEARS.

WE ALSO HAVE HUNDREDS OF U.S. AND FOREIGN PATENTS COVERING

COMPONENTS, FEATURES, AND DESIGNS USED IN VARIOUS ATHLETIC AND

LEISURE SHOES, APPAREL AND EQUIPMENT. THESE PATENTS EXPIRE AT

VARIOUS TIMES, AND HAVE A REMAINING DURATION OF FROM NOW TO AT

LEAST 2025, ALTHOUGH THE DURATION OF PATENTS VARIES BY COUNTRY.

WE BELIEVE THAT OUR SUCCESS DEPENDS PRIMARILY UPON SKILLS IN

DESIGN, RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, PRODUCTION AND MARKETING

RATHER THAN UPON OUR PATENT POSITION. HOWEVER, WE HAVE FOLLOWED

A POLICY OF FILING APPLICATIONS FOR UNITED STATES AND FOREIGN

PATENTS ON INVENTIONS, DESIGNS AND IMPROVEMENTS THAT WE DEEM

VALUABLE.

EMPLOYEES

WE HAD APPROXIMATELY 26,000 EMPLOYEES AT MAY 31, 2005.

MANAGEMENT CONSIDERS ITS RELATIONSHIP WITH EMPLOYEES TO BE

EXCELLENT. NONE OF OUR EMPLOYEES IS REPRESENTED BY A UNION, WITH

THE EXCEPTION OF BAUER NIKE HOCKEY INC. OF BAUER NIKE

HOCKEYS EMPLOYEES, APPROXIMATELY 33 PERCENT, OR

APPROXIMATELY 157, ARE COVERED BY TWO UNION COLLECTIVE

BARGAINING AGREEMENTS WITH TWO SEPARATE BARGAINING UNITS. THE

COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENTS EXPIRE ON VARIOUS DATES FROM

2005 THROUGH 2007. THERE HAS NEVER BEEN A MATERIAL INTERRUPTION

OF OPERATIONS DUE TO LABOR DISAGREEMENTS.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL

CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

OVERVIEW

NIKE DESIGNS, DEVELOPS AND MARKETS HIGH QUALITY FOOTWEAR,

APPAREL, EQUIPMENT AND ACCESSORY PRODUCTS WORLDWIDE. WE ARE THE

LARGEST SELLER OF ATHLETIC FOOTWEAR AND ATHLETIC APPAREL IN THE

WORLD AND SELL OUR PRODUCTS PRIMARILY THROUGH A COMBINATION OF

RETAIL ACCOUNTS, NIKE-OWNED RETAIL STORES, INDEPENDENT

DISTRIBUTORS AND LICENSEES, IN THE UNITED STATES AND OVER 160

COUNTRIES WORLDWIDE. OUR GOAL IS TO DELIVER VALUE TO OUR

SHAREHOLDERS BY BUILDING A PROFITABLE PORTFOLIO OF GLOBAL

FOOTWEAR, APPAREL, EQUIPMENT AND ACCESSORIES BRANDS. OUR

STRATEGY FOR BUILDING THIS PORTFOLIO IS FOCUSED IN FOUR KEY

AREAS.



DEEPENING OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH CONSUMERS;



DELIVERING SUPERIOR, INNOVATIVE PRODUCTS TO THE MARKETPLACE;



MAKING OUR SUPPLY CHAIN A COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE, THROUGH

OPERATIONAL DISCIPLINE AND EXCELLENCE; AND



ACCELERATING GROWTH THROUGH FOCUSED EXECUTION.

BY EXECUTING THIS STRATEGY, WE AIM TO DELIVER THE FOLLOWING

LONG-TERM FINANCIAL GOALS.



HIGH SINGLE DIGIT REVENUE GROWTH;



MID-TEENS EARNINGS PER SHARE GROWTH;



INCREASED RETURN ON INVESTED CAPITAL AND ACCELERATED CASH

FLOWS; AND



CONSISTENT RESULTS THROUGH EFFECTIVE MANAGEMENT OF OUR

DIVERSIFIED PORTFOLIO OF BUSINESSES.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

IN FISCAL 2005 WE MET OR SURPASSED THESE FINANCIAL GOALS. OUR

REVENUES GREW 12% TO $13.7 BILLION, NET INCOME GREW 28% TO

$1.2 BILLION, AND WE DELIVERED DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE

OF $4.48, A 28% INCREASE VERSUS FISCAL 2004. THE IMPACT OF

FOREIGN CURRENCY CHANGES HAS HAD A FAVORABLE IMPACT ON THIS

YEARS CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, PRIMARILY AS A

CONTRIBUTOR TO THE GROWTH IN OUR GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE. FOR

FISCAL 2005, OUR CONSOLIDATED GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE INCREASED

160 BASIS POINTS TO 44.5%. ADDITIONALLY, WE HAVE IMPROVED

OUR RETURN ON INVESTED CAPITAL, INCREASED FREE CASH FLOW FROM

OPERATIONS AND CONTINUED TO RETURN CASH TO SHAREHOLDERS THROUGH

DIVIDENDS AND SHARE REPURCHASES. ALTHOUGH IN ANY PARTICULAR

QUARTER OR FISCAL YEAR WE MAY NOT MEET ALL OF THE FINANCIAL

GOALS OUTLINED ABOVE, WE CONTINUE TO BELIEVE THESE ARE

APPROPRIATE LONG-TERM GOALS.

CONSOLIDATED OPERATING RESULTS

IN FISCAL 2005, CONSOLIDATED REVENUES GREW 12% VERSUS FISCAL

2004; THREE PERCENTAGE POINTS OF THIS GROWTH IS ATTRIBUTED TO

CHANGES IN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES, PRIMARILY THE STRONGER EURO.

EXCLUDING THE IMPACT OF CHANGES IN FOREIGN CURRENCY, REVENUE

GROWTH IN OUR INTERNATIONAL REGIONS CONTRIBUTED

4 PERCENTAGE POINTS TO THE CONSOLIDATED REVENUE GROWTH, AS

ALL THREE OF OUR INTERNATIONAL REGIONS POSTED HIGHER REVENUES.

THE U.S. REGION CONTRIBUTED 3 PERCENTAGE POINTS OF THE

CONSOLIDATED REVENUE GROWTH FOR FISCAL 2005. SALES IN OUR OTHER

BUSINESSES OPERATING SEGMENT DROVE THE REMAINDER OF THE

IMPROVEMENT OF CONSOLIDATED REVENUE GROWTH FOR FISCAL 2005.

CONVERSE, A COMPONENT OF THE OTHER BUSINESSES, WAS ACQUIRED AT

THE BEGINNING OF THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2004. THE

COMPARISON OF A FULL YEAR OF RESULTS IN FISCAL 2005 VERSUS A

PARTIAL YEAR IN FISCAL 2004 CONTRIBUTED 1 PERCENTAGE POINT

TO THE CONSOLIDATED REVENUE GROWTH. SEE THE ACCOMPANYING

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(NOTE 15  ACQUISITIONS)

FOR ADDITIONAL

INFORMATION RELATED TO THE ACQUISITION.

DURING FISCAL 2005, OUR CONSOLIDATED GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE

IMPROVED 160 BASIS POINTS VERSUS THE PRIOR YEAR, FROM 42.9%

TO 44.5%. THE PRIMARY FACTORS CONTRIBUTING TO THE IMPROVED GROSS

MARGIN PERCENTAGE FOR FISCAL 2005 WERE AS FOLLOWS.

(1)

HIGHER GROSS MARGINS IN OUR INTERNATIONAL REGIONS, DRIVEN

PRIMARILY BY OUR EUROPE, MIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA (EMEA) REGION,

ACCOUNTED FOR 90 BASIS POINTS OF THE OVERALL MARGIN

IMPROVEMENT IN FISCAL 2005. THIS IMPROVEMENT WAS DRIVEN BY

CHANGES IN CURRENCY HEDGE RATES, PRIMARILY THE EURO, PARTIALLY

OFFSET BY LOWER IN-LINE PRICING MARGINS (NET REVENUE FOR CURRENT

PRODUCT OFFERINGS MINUS PRODUCT COSTS) AND A HIGHER PERCENTAGE

OF LESS PROFITABLE CLOSEOUT SALES (NON-CURRENT

15

TABLE OF CONTENTS

PRODUCT OFFERINGS), THE RESULT OF HIGHER FOOTWEAR AND APPAREL

CLOSEOUT INVENTORIES IN OUR EMEA AND ASIA PACIFIC REGIONS (AS

DISCUSSED BELOW).

(A)

YEAR-OVER-YEAR HEDGE RATE IMPROVEMENTS CONTRIBUTED APPROXIMATELY

170 BASIS POINTS TO THE FISCAL 2005 CONSOLIDATED GROSS

MARGIN PERCENTAGE IMPROVEMENT.

WE HAVE HEDGED THE MAJORITY OF PRODUCT PURCHASES FOR FISCAL 2006

AND A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THOSE ARE AT MORE FAVORABLE RATES

THAN PRODUCT PURCHASES IN FISCAL 2005. BASED ON THESE HEDGE

RATES, WE EXPECT HEDGE RATES TO HAVE A POSITIVE IMPACT ON OUR

GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE DURING FISCAL 2006 AS COMPARED TO FISCAL

2005, WITH THE GREATER IMPACT OCCURRING DURING THE FIRST HALF OF

THE YEAR. SEE THE ACCOMPANYING

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (NOTE 16  RISK MANAGEMENT

AND DERIVATIVES)

FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON HEDGES.

(B)

LOWER IN-LINE PRICING MARGINS IN EMEA AND ASIA PACIFIC WERE DUE

TO STRATEGIES TO IMPROVE PRODUCT VALUE IN THESE REGIONS. IN

ADDITION, INCREASED LEVELS OF CLOSEOUT SALES AND LOWER CLOSEOUT

PRICING, THE RESULT OF THE LIQUIDATION OF HIGHER FOOTWEAR AND

APPAREL CLOSEOUT INVENTORIES THIS YEAR, REDUCED THE OVERALL

GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE IMPROVEMENT IN THOSE REGIONS. TOGETHER,

THESE FACTORS RESULTED IN A REDUCTION IN THE CONSOLIDATED GROSS

MARGIN PERCENTAGE OF ABOUT 60 BASIS POINTS FOR FISCAL 2005.

(2)

HIGHER GROSS MARGINS IN THE U.S. REGION CONTRIBUTED

APPROXIMATELY 30 BASIS POINTS TO THE IMPROVEMENT IN THE

CONSOLIDATED GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE FOR FISCAL 2005. FEWER,

MORE PROFITABLE CLOSEOUTS IN FOOTWEAR DROVE THE IMPROVEMENT

PARTIALLY OFFSET BY INCREASED SALES DISCOUNTS (THE RESULT OF

INCREASED SALES TO HIGH VOLUME ACCOUNTS) AND HIGHER PRODUCT

COSTS AND AIR FREIGHT INCURRED TO MEET STRONG FOOTWEAR DEMAND.

(3)

IMPROVED GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGES IN OUR OTHER BUSINESSES

REPRESENTED 30 BASIS POINTS OF IMPROVEMENT FOR FISCAL 2005.

THE ADDITION OF CONVERSE (ACQUIRED IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF

FISCAL 2004) AND EXETER BRANDS GROUP (FORMED IN THE FIRST

QUARTER OF FISCAL 2005) DROVE THE GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE

IMPROVEMENT. BOTH EXETER BRANDS GROUP AND THE INTERNATIONAL

PORTION OF CONVERSES BUSINESS OPERATE ON A LICENSING

MODEL, WHICH CARRIES HIGHER GROSS MARGINS AND LOWER OPERATING

EXPENSES THAN THE REMAINDER OF OUR OTHER BUSINESSES.

FISCAL 2005 SELLING AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE, COMPRISED OF

DEMAND CREATION AND OPERATING OVERHEAD, GREW 14% VERSUS FISCAL

2004. THREE PERCENTAGE POINTS OF THE INCREASE FOR FISCAL 2005

WERE DUE TO CHANGES IN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES. THE IMPACT OF A

FULL FISCAL YEAR FOR CONVERSE AND THE FORMATION OF EXETER BRANDS

GROUP ADDED ONE PERCENTAGE POINT OF GROWTH.

DEMAND CREATION (ADVERTISING AND PROMOTION) EXPENSE GREW 16% TO

$1,600.7 MILLION IN FISCAL 2005. THREE PERCENTAGE POINTS OF

THE INCREASE IN DEMAND CREATION WERE DUE TO CHANGES IN CURRENCY

EXCHANGE RATES. EXCLUDING THE IMPACT OF CHANGES IN FOREIGN

CURRENCY RATES, THE INCREASE IN DEMAND CREATION SPENDING FOR THE

FISCAL YEAR WAS ATTRIBUTABLE TO HIGHER SPENDING ON SPORTS

MARKETING ENDORSEMENT CONTRACTS AND EVENTS PRIMARILY IN THE

U.S., EMEA AND ASIA PACIFIC REGIONS (5 PERCENTAGE POINTS),

HIGHER ADVERTISING SPENDING PRIMARILY IN THE EMEA REGION

(3 PERCENTAGE POINTS), AND INCREMENTAL INVESTMENT IN RETAIL

MARKETING IN THE U.S., EMEA AND ASIA PACIFIC REGIONS

(2 PERCENTAGE POINTS). THE ADDITION OF CONVERSE AND

FORMATION OF EXETER BRANDS GROUP CONTRIBUTED 2 PERCENTAGE

POINTS OF THE DEMAND CREATION INCREASE FOR THE YEAR.

OPERATING OVERHEAD FOR FISCAL 2005 WAS $2,621.0 MILLION, A

13% INCREASE OVER FISCAL 2004. CHANGES IN CURRENCY EXCHANGE

RATES CONTRIBUTED 3 PERCENTAGE POINTS OF THE INCREASE.

EXCLUDING THE EFFECTS OF FOREIGN CURRENCY, OPERATING OVERHEAD

INCREASES FOR FISCAL 2005 WERE MAINLY ATTRIBUTABLE TO HIGHER

PERSONNEL COSTS DUE TO INCREASED HEADCOUNT, HIGHER WAGES AND

BENEFITS AND INCREASED INCENTIVE-BASED COMPENSATION FOR

EMPLOYEES (4 PERCENTAGE POINTS), INVESTMENTS IN EMERGING

MARKETS (SUCH AS CHINA, INDIA AND OUR CENTRAL EUROPE, MIDDLE

EAST AND AFRICA UNIT) AND OUR OTHER BUSINESSES

(3 PERCENTAGE POINTS), INCREASED COSTS DUE TO SALES AND

LEADERSHIP EVENTS (2 PERCENTAGE POINTS) AND INVESTMENTS IN

NIKE-OWNED RETAIL STORES (1 PERCENTAGE POINT).

16

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE MOST SIGNIFICANT COMPONENT OF OTHER EXPENSE, NET, OF

$29.1 MILLION FOR FISCAL 2005 WAS FOREIGN CURRENCY HEDGE

LOSSES. THESE LOSSES ARE REFLECTED IN THE CORPORATE LINE IN OUR

SEGMENT PRESENTATION OF PRE-TAX INCOME IN THE ACCOMPANYING

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(NOTE 17  OPERATING SEGMENTS AND RELATED

INFORMATION).

THE HEDGE LOSSES REFLECT THAT THE EURO HAS

STRENGTHENED SINCE WE ENTERED INTO THESE HEDGE CONTRACTS. IN

FISCAL 2004, FOREIGN CURRENCY HEDGE LOSSES WERE ALSO THE MOST

SIGNIFICANT COMPONENT OF OTHER EXPENSE, NET, OF

$74.7 MILLION. THE YEAR-OVER-YEAR IMPROVEMENT IN OTHER

EXPENSE, NET, FOR FISCAL 2005 WAS MAINLY DUE TO LOWER FOREIGN

CURRENCY HEDGE LOSSES AND LOWER NET LOSSES ON ASSET DISPOSALS

COMPARED TO THOSE RECORDED IN FISCAL 2004.

IN 2005, NET FOREIGN CURRENCY LOSSES IN OTHER EXPENSE, NET, WERE

MORE THAN OFFSET BY FAVORABLE TRANSLATION OF FOREIGN CURRENCY

DENOMINATED PROFITS, MOST SIGNIFICANTLY IN EMEA. OUR ESTIMATE OF

THE COMBINED IMPACT OF LOWER FOREIGN CURRENCY CONVERSION LOSSES

AND THE FAVORABLE TRANSLATION OF FOREIGN-CURRENCY DENOMINATED

PROFITS IS A $95 MILLION ADDITION TO CONSOLIDATED INCOME

BEFORE INCOME TAXES COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR. IF CURRENT

EXCHANGE RATES REMAIN CONSTANT, WE DO NOT EXPECT A SIGNIFICANT

IMPACT ON OUR CONSOLIDATED INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES RELATED TO

FOREIGN CURRENCY GAINS OR LOSSES AND THE OFFSETTING TRANSLATION

FOR FISCAL 2006 AS COMPARED TO FISCAL 2005.

OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR FISCAL 2005 WAS 34.9%, WHICH IS

SLIGHTLY HIGHER THAN THE FISCAL 2004 RATE OF 34.8% PRIMARILY DUE

TO DECREASES IN TAX CREDITS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER TAXES ON

FOREIGN EARNINGS IN FISCAL 2005.

DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF FISCAL 2005 WE DECIDED TO

REPATRIATE $500 MILLION OF FOREIGN EARNINGS DURING FISCAL

2006 UNDER THE AMERICAN JOBS CREATION ACT (THE ACT), WHICH

WAS SIGNED INTO LAW BY THE PRESIDENT ON OCTOBER 22, 2004.

THE ACT CREATES A TEMPORARY INCENTIVE FOR

U.S. MULTINATIONAL CORPORATIONS TO REPATRIATE ACCUMULATED

INCOME EARNED OUTSIDE THE U.S. BY PROVIDING AN 85% DIVIDEND

RECEIVED DEDUCTION FOR CERTAIN DIVIDENDS FROM CONTROLLED FOREIGN

CORPORATIONS. WE ELECTED TO REPATRIATE A COMBINATION OF FOREIGN

EARNINGS FOR WHICH U.S. TAXES HAD PREVIOUSLY BEEN PROVIDED

AND FOREIGN EARNINGS THAT HAD BEEN DESIGNATED AS PERMANENTLY

REINVESTED. ACCORDINGLY, THE PROVISIONS MADE DID NOT HAVE A

MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR INCOME TAX EXPENSE OR OUR EFFECTIVE TAX

RATE FOR THE YEAR.

WORLDWIDE FUTURES AND ADVANCE ORDERS FOR FOOTWEAR AND APPAREL

SCHEDULED FOR DELIVERY FROM JUNE THROUGH NOVEMBER 2005 WERE 9.5%

HIGHER THAN SUCH ORDERS REPORTED FOR THE COMPARABLE PERIOD OF

FISCAL 2004. APPROXIMATELY 1 POINT OF THIS REPORTED INCREASE WAS

DUE TO CHANGES IN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES VERSUS THE SAME PERIOD

LAST YEAR. EXCLUDING THIS CURRENCY IMPACT, SLIGHTLY HIGHER

AVERAGE SELLING PRICES FOR BOTH FOOTWEAR AND APPAREL CONTRIBUTED

1 POINT OF THE GROWTH IN OVERALL FUTURES AND ADVANCE ORDERS. THE

REMAINING INCREASE WAS DUE TO VOLUME INCREASES FOR BOTH FOOTWEAR

AND APPAREL. AS ALWAYS, THE REPORTED FUTURES ORDERS GROWTH IS

NOT NECESSARILY INDICATIVE OF OUR EXPECTATION OF REVENUE GROWTH

DURING THIS PERIOD. THIS IS BECAUSE THE MIX OF ORDERS CAN SHIFT

BETWEEN ADVANCE/FUTURES AND AT-ONCE ORDERS. IN ADDITION, FOREIGN

CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE FLUCTUATIONS AS WELL AS DIFFERING LEVELS

OF ORDER CANCELLATIONS CAN CAUSE DIFFERENCES IN THE COMPARISONS

BETWEEN FUTURES ORDERS AND ACTUAL REVENUES. MOREOVER, A

SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR REVENUE IS NOT DERIVED FROM FUTURES

ORDERS, INCLUDING WHOLESALE SALES OF EQUIPMENT,

U.S. LICENSED TEAM APPAREL, BAUER NIKE HOCKEY, COLE HAAN,

CONVERSE, EXETER BRANDS GROUP, HURLEY, NIKE GOLF AND RETAIL

SALES ACROSS ALL BRANDS.

CERTAIN PRIOR YEAR AMOUNTS HAVE BEEN RECLASSIFIED TO CONFORM TO

FISCAL YEAR 2005 PRESENTATION.

THE DISCUSSION FOLLOWING INCLUDES DISCLOSURE OF PRE-TAX

INCOME FOR OUR OPERATING SEGMENTS. WE HAVE REPORTED

PRE-TAX INCOME FOR EACH OF OUR OPERATING SEGMENTS IN ACCORDANCE

WITH STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARD NO. 131,

DISCLOSURES ABOUT SEGMENTS OF AN ENTERPRISE AND RELATED

INFORMATION. AS DISCUSSED IN

NOTE 17 

OPERATING SEGMENTS AND RELATED INFORMATION

IN THE

ACCOMPANYING

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS,

CERTAIN CORPORATE COSTS ARE NOT INCLUDED IN PRE-TAX INCOME OF

OUR OPERATING SEGMENTS.

FOR EMEA, CHANGES IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES ACCOUNTED

FOR 7 PERCENTAGE POINTS OF THE REPORTED REVENUE GROWTH IN

FISCAL 2005. EXCLUDING THE EFFECTS OF FOREIGN CURRENCY, EMEA

REGION REVENUES GREW 5 PERCENT AS EACH PRODUCT BUSINESS

UNIT (FOOTWEAR, APPAREL AND EQUIPMENT) EXPERIENCED GROWTH. THE

FOLLOWING ANALYSIS EXCLUDES THE IMPACT OF CHANGES IN FOREIGN

CURRENCY. THE INCREASE OVER THE PRIOR YEAR WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN

BY INCREASED UNIT SALES OF FOOTWEAR, APPAREL AND EQUIPMENT

PARTIALLY OFFSET BY DECLINES IN THE AVERAGE PRICES IN EACH OF

THE BUSINESS UNITS. ALTHOUGH APPAREL AND EQUIPMENT BUSINESS

UNITS EXPERIENCED GROWTH FOR FISCAL 2005, REVENUES FELL SLIGHTLY

IN THE FOURTH QUARTER PRIMARILY DUE TO COMPARISONS TO VERY

STRONG SALES IN THE PRIOR YEARS FOURTH QUARTER RELATED TO

THE 2004 EUROPEAN FOOTBALL CHAMPIONSHIPS. FOR FISCAL 2005, SALES

INCREASES IN THE EMERGING MARKETS IN OUR CENTRAL EUROPE, MIDDLE

EAST AND AFRICA UNIT, ALONG WITH SALES INCREASES IN THE UK AND

ITALY, DROVE THE GROWTH. THESE INCREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET

BY LOWER SALES IN FRANCE, GERMANY AND NORTHERN EUROPE.

18

TABLE OF CONTENTS

FOR THE EMEA REGION, FUTURES ORDERS SCHEDULED FOR DELIVERY FROM

JUNE THROUGH NOVEMBER 2005 WERE 7 PERCENTAGE POINTS HIGHER

THAN SUCH ORDERS RECEIVED FOR THE COMPARABLE PERIOD OF FISCAL

2004. CHANGES IN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES CONTRIBUTED

2 PERCENTAGE POINTS OF THIS GROWTH. EXCLUDING THE CHANGES

IN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES, THE GROWTH WAS DRIVEN BY AN INCREASE

IN THE REGIONS FOOTWEAR AND APPAREL UNIT ORDERS AND

INCREASES IN APPARELS AVERAGE PRICE. THESE INCREASES WERE

PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECREASE IN THE REGIONS FOOTWEAR

AVERAGE PRICE PER PAIR, PARTIALLY DUE TO STRATEGIES TO IMPROVE

THE PRODUCT VALUE.

EMEA PRE-TAX INCOME FOR FISCAL 2005 WAS $917.5 MILLION, UP

23% VERSUS THE PRIOR YEAR. HIGHER REVENUES AND GROSS MARGIN

IMPROVEMENTS DROVE THE INCREASE, MORE THAN OFFSETTING INCREASED

SELLING AND ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS. THE IMPROVED GROSS MARGINS,

WHICH CONTRIBUTED 90 BASIS POINTS OF GROWTH TO THE

CONSOLIDATED GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE, WERE PRIMARILY THE RESULT

OF IMPROVED YEAR-OVER-YEAR HEDGE RATES PARTIALLY OFFSET BY

REDUCED IN-LINE PRICING MARGINS AND HIGHER, LESS PROFITABLE

CLOSEOUT SALES.

IN THE ASIA PACIFIC REGION, 4 PERCENTAGE POINTS OF REPORTED

REVENUE GROWTH FOR THE FISCAL YEAR WERE DUE TO CHANGES IN

CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES. THE FOLLOWING ANALYSIS EXCLUDES THE

IMPACT OF CHANGES IN FOREIGN CURRENCY. SALES IN EACH ASIA

PACIFIC PRODUCT BUSINESS UNIT GREW VERSUS FISCAL 2004 WITH THE

GROWTH PRIMARILY DUE TO UNIT VOLUME; AVERAGE PRICE PER UNIT

INCREASED SLIGHTLY. SIGNIFICANT REVENUE INCREASES IN CHINA

(DRIVEN BY EXPANSION OF RETAIL DISTRIBUTION AND STRONG CONSUMER

DEMAND) AND INCREASES IN EVERY OTHER COUNTRY IN THE REGION

EXCEPT AUSTRALIA AND NEW ZEALAND WERE THE KEY GROWTH DRIVERS FOR

FISCAL 2005.

FOR THE ASIA PACIFIC REGION, FUTURES ORDERS SCHEDULED FOR

DELIVERY FROM JUNE THROUGH NOVEMBER 2005 WERE 11 PERCENTAGE

POINTS HIGHER THAN SUCH ORDERS RECEIVED FOR THE COMPARABLE

PERIOD OF FISCAL 2004. CHANGES IN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES

CONTRIBUTED 2 PERCENTAGE POINTS OF THIS GROWTH. EXCLUDING

THE CHANGES IN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES, THE GROWTH WAS DRIVEN BY

AN INCREASE IN THE REGIONS FOOTWEAR AND APPAREL UNIT

ORDERS. THESE INCREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECREASE IN

THE REGIONS AVERAGE SELLING PRICE PER UNIT FOR FOOTWEAR

AND APPAREL.

PRE-TAX INCOME FOR THE ASIA PACIFIC REGION INCREASED 13% VERSUS

FISCAL 2004 TO $399.8 MILLION. HIGHER REVENUES WERE

PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A LOWER GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE AND

INCREASED SELLING AND ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS. THE REDUCED GROSS

MARGIN PERCENTAGE, WHICH HAD A MINIMAL NEGATIVE IMPACT ON THE

NET OVERALL CONSOLIDATED GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE CHANGE, WAS

PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO LESS PROFITABLE CLOSEOUT SALES AND

REDUCED IN-LINE PRICING MARGINS DUE TO STRATEGIES TO IMPROVE THE

PRODUCT VALUE, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY BETTER YEAR-OVER-YEAR

CURRENCY HEDGE RATES.

IN THE AMERICAS REGION, 1 PERCENTAGE POINT OF THE REVENUE

GROWTH FOR FISCAL 2005 WAS DUE TO CHANGES IN CURRENCY EXCHANGE

RATES. EXCLUDING THE EFFECTS OF CHANGES IN FOREIGN CURRENCY,

SALES IN EACH AMERICAS PRODUCT BUSINESS UNIT GREW IN FISCAL

2005. THE REVENUE GROWTH WAS DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY HIGHER SALES IN

CENTRAL AND SOUTH AMERICA, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER SALES IN

CANADA.

IN FISCAL 2005, PRE-TAX INCOME FOR THE AMERICAS REGION INCREASED

21% FROM THE PRIOR YEAR, TO $117.6 MILLION. THE INCREASE IN

PRE-TAX INCOME WAS ATTRIBUTABLE TO HIGHER REVENUES AND AN

IMPROVED GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER

SELLING AND ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS. THE IMPROVED GROSS MARGIN

PERCENTAGE HAD A MINIMAL IMPACT ON THE CONSOLIDATED GROSS MARGIN

PERCENTAGE IMPROVEMENT.

IN THE U.S. REGION, REVENUES FOR FISCAL 2005 GREW 7% VERSUS

FISCAL 2004, AS REVENUES INCREASED IN EACH PRODUCT BUSINESS

UNIT. THE INCREASE IN FOOTWEAR REVENUE WAS DUE TO A

5 PERCENTAGE POINT INCREASE IN UNIT SALES AND A

4 PERCENTAGE POINT INCREASE IN THE AVERAGE PRICE PER PAIR.

THE INCREASES IN UNIT SALES AND THE AVERAGE PRICE PER PAIR ARE

DUE TO INCREASED CONSUMER DEMAND FOR PERFORMANCE PRODUCTS,

ESPECIALLY THOSE WITH A SUGGESTED RETAIL PRICE OVER $100.

THE INCREASE IN APPAREL SALES FOR FISCAL 2005 WAS DRIVEN BY

VOLUME INCREASES IN BRANDED APPAREL, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A

DECLINE IN REVENUE FROM SALES OF LICENSED APPAREL. THE DECLINE

IN REVENUE FROM LICENSED APPAREL WAS DUE TO THE EXPIRATION OF

OUR LICENSE AGREEMENT WITH THE NBA, IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF

FISCAL 2005, AND A SHIFT IN CONSUMER PREFERENCE TOWARDS BRANDED

APPAREL. FOR THE FIRST QUARTER AND INTO THE SECOND QUARTER OF

FISCAL 2006, WE EXPECT REVENUES GENERATED BY LICENSED APPAREL TO

BE BELOW THE PRIOR YEAR LEVELS DUE TO THE EXPIRATION OF THE

AGREEMENT WITH THE NBA.

19

TABLE OF CONTENTS

FOR THE U.S. REGION, FUTURES ORDERS SCHEDULED FOR DELIVERY

FROM JUNE THROUGH NOVEMBER 2005 INCREASED 9 PERCENTAGE

POINTS VERSUS THE SAME PERIOD OF THE PRIOR YEAR. FUTURES ORDERS

INCREASED DUE TO UNIT GROWTH FOR BOTH FOOTWEAR AND APPAREL AND

HIGHER AVERAGE PRICE PER PAIR FOR FOOTWEAR. AS DISCUSSED ABOVE,

THESE REPORTED FUTURES DO NOT COVER ALL COMPONENTS OF OUR

OVERALL REVENUES, SUCH AS U.S. LICENSED APPAREL (EXPECTED

TO DECREASE AS NOTED ABOVE), EQUIPMENT, CLOSEOUTS, AT-ONCE

ORDERS AND RETAIL SALES. AS A RESULT, REVENUE GROWTH FOR THE

U.S. REGION FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2006 IS

EXPECTED TO BE BELOW THE REPORTED FUTURES GROWTH.

FOR FISCAL 2005, PRE-TAX INCOME FOR THE U.S. REGION WAS

$1,125.8 MILLION, A 12% INCREASE VERSUS FISCAL 2004. HIGHER

REVENUES AND IMPROVED GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE DROVE THE

INCREASE, MORE THAN OFFSETTING HIGHER SELLING AND ADMINISTRATIVE

COSTS. THE IMPROVED GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE CONTRIBUTED

30 BASIS POINTS OF GROWTH TO THE CONSOLIDATED GROSS MARGIN

PERCENTAGE GROWTH AND WAS PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF FEWER, MORE

PROFITABLE CLOSEOUTS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY INCREASED DISCOUNTS AND

HIGHER PRODUCT COSTS AND AIR FREIGHT INCURRED TO MEET STRONG

FOOTWEAR DEMAND.

REVENUES AND PRE-TAX INCOME FOR OUR OTHER BUSINESSES IN FISCAL

2005 INCLUDE RESULTS FROM BAUER NIKE HOCKEY INC., COLE HAAN

HOLDINGS INCORPORATED, CONVERSE INC., HURLEY INTERNATIONAL LLC,

NIKE GOLF AND EXETER BRANDS GROUP LLC. EXETER BRANDS GROUP LLC

IS A WHOLLY OWNED SUBSIDIARY OF NIKE, INC., FORMED IN THE FIRST

QUARTER OF FISCAL 2005 TO DEVELOP THE COMPANYS BUSINESS IN

RETAIL CHANNELS SERVING VALUE-CONSCIOUS CONSUMERS AND TO OPERATE

THE BUSINESS OBTAINED IN THE ACQUISITION OF OFFICIAL STARTER

PROPERTIES LLC AND OFFICIAL STARTER LLC (COLLECTIVELY

OFFICIAL STARTER). FOR FISCAL 2005, THE ADDITION OF

CONVERSE, ACQUIRED IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2004, AND THE

FORMATION OF EXETER BRANDS GROUP TOGETHER DROVE

12 PERCENTAGE POINTS OF THE OTHER BUSINESS REVENUE INCREASE

OF 22% OVER FISCAL 2004. THE REMAINDER OF THE INCREASE WAS

DRIVEN BY REVENUE GROWTH AT COLE HAAN, NIKE GOLF AND HURLEY.

PRE-TAX INCOME FROM THE OTHER BUSINESSES IMPROVED TO

$153.9 MILLION IN FISCAL 2005, VERSUS INCOME OF

$75.3 MILLION IN FISCAL 2004. THE YEAR-OVER-YEAR

IMPROVEMENT WAS DRIVEN BY THE ADDITION OF CONVERSE, IMPROVED

RESULTS FROM COLE HAAN AND BAUER AND THE FORMATION OF THE EXETER

BRANDS GROUP.

FISCAL 2004 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2003

CONSOLIDATED OPERATING RESULTS

IN FISCAL 2004, CONSOLIDATED REVENUES GREW 15% VERSUS FISCAL

2003; SEVEN PERCENTAGE POINTS OF THIS GROWTH WERE DUE TO CHANGES

IN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES, PRIMARILY THE STRONGER EURO.

EXCLUDING THE IMPACT OF CHANGES IN FOREIGN CURRENCY, REVENUE

GROWTH IN OUR INTERNATIONAL REGIONS CONTRIBUTED

3 PERCENTAGE POINTS TO THE CONSOLIDATED REVENUE GROWTH AND

ALL THREE OF OUR INTERNATIONAL REGIONS POSTED HIGHER REVENUES,

WITH OUR ASIA PACIFIC REGION MAKING THE LARGEST CONTRIBUTION.

CONVERSE, WHICH WAS ACQUIRED AT THE BEGINNING OF THE SECOND

QUARTER OF FISCAL 2004, CONTRIBUTED 2 PERCENTAGE POINTS OF

CONSOLIDATED REVENUE GROWTH. IMPROVED SALES IN THE

U.S. REGION AND INCREASES IN OUR OTHER BUSINESSES DROVE THE

BALANCE OF THE CONSOLIDATED REVENUE GROWTH.

DURING FISCAL 2004, OUR CONSOLIDATED GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE

IMPROVED 190 BASIS POINTS VERSUS THE PRIOR YEAR, FROM 41.0%

TO 42.9%. THE PRIMARY FACTORS CONTRIBUTING TO THE IMPROVED GROSS

MARGIN PERCENTAGE FOR FISCAL 2004 WERE AS FOLLOWS.

(1)

CHANGES IN HEDGE RATES, PRIMARILY THE EURO, REPRESENTED

70 BASIS POINTS OF IMPROVEMENT FOR FISCAL 2004. THE

POSITIVE IMPACT OF HEDGE RATES ON THE FISCAL 2004 GROSS MARGIN

PERCENTAGE WAS MOST SIGNIFICANT IN THE FOURTH QUARTER,

CONTRIBUTING 140 BASIS POINTS OF THE YEAR-OVER-YEAR

QUARTERLY IMPROVEMENT.

(2)

HIGHER IN-LINE PRICING MARGINS DROVE APPROXIMATELY 70 BASIS

POINTS OF THE IMPROVEMENT IN THE CONSOLIDATED GROSS MARGIN

PERCENTAGE FOR FISCAL 2004. THIS WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO

IMPROVED FOOTWEAR MARGINS AS A RESULT OF LOWER PRODUCT COSTS DUE

TO MANUFACTURING EFFICIENCIES, REDUCED MATERIALS COSTS AND LOWER

AIR FREIGHT.

(3)

IMPROVED PROFITABILITY ON WHOLESALE CLOSEOUT SALES, PRIMARILY IN

THE U.S. AND EMEA REGIONS DUE TO IMPROVED CLOSEOUT PRICING

MARGINS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY INCREASED OBSOLESCENCE RESERVES DUE

TO A LESS FAVORABLE MIX OF PRODUCT REMAINING IN CLOSEOUT

INVENTORY. THESE FACTORS

20

TABLE OF CONTENTS

REPRESENTED APPROXIMATELY 10 BASIS POINTS OF THE

IMPROVEMENT IN THE CONSOLIDATED GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE FOR

FISCAL 2004.

(4)

MOST OF THE REMAINING INCREASE WAS DUE TO IMPROVED GROSS MARGIN

PERCENTAGES FOR NIKE-OWNED RETAIL STORES IN THE U.S. AND EMEA

REGIONS, WHICH CONTRIBUTED APPROXIMATELY 30 BASIS POINTS OF

THE IMPROVEMENT IN CONSOLIDATED GROSS MARGINS FOR FISCAL 2004.

FISCAL 2004 SELLING AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE GREW 17% VERSUS

FISCAL 2003. DEMAND CREATION EXPENSE GREW 18% TO

$1,377.9 MILLION IN FISCAL 2004. SEVEN PERCENTAGE POINTS OF

THE INCREASE IN DEMAND CREATION WERE DUE TO CHANGES IN CURRENCY

EXCHANGE RATES. EXCLUDING THE IMPACT OF CHANGES IN FOREIGN

CURRENCY RATES, THE INCREASE IN DEMAND CREATION SPENDING FOR THE

FISCAL YEAR WAS ATTRIBUTABLE TO HIGHER SPENDING ON ENDORSEMENT

CONTRACTS IN THE U.S., PRIMARILY BASKETBALL (3 PERCENTAGE

POINT IMPACT), INCREMENTAL INVESTMENT IN RETAIL MARKETING IN THE

U.S., EMEA AND ASIA PACIFIC REGIONS (3 PERCENTAGE POINT

IMPACT), AND HIGHER ADVERTISING SPENDING IN THE ASIA PACIFIC

REGION (1 PERCENTAGE POINT IMPACT). THE ADDITION OF

CONVERSE CONTRIBUTED 2 PERCENTAGE POINTS OF THE DEMAND

CREATION INCREASE FOR THE YEAR.

OPERATING OVERHEAD FOR FISCAL 2004 WAS $2,324.1 MILLION, A

17% INCREASE OVER FISCAL 2003. CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES

CONTRIBUTED 5 PERCENTAGE POINTS OF THE INCREASE. THE

ADDITION OF CONVERSE ACCOUNTED FOR 2 PERCENTAGE POINTS OF

GROWTH. OTHER KEY FACTORS DRIVING THE INCREASE IN OPERATING

OVERHEAD FOR THE FISCAL YEAR WERE: (A) INCREASED

INCENTIVE-BASED COMPENSATION FOR EMPLOYEES (3 PERCENTAGE

POINTS); AND (B) INCREASED COSTS TO SUPPORT THE GROWTH OF

OUR NIKE GOLF, COLE HAAN, BAUER NIKE HOCKEY AND HURLEY

BUSINESSES (2 PERCENTAGE POINTS). THE REMAINING INCREASE,

ABOUT 5 PERCENTAGE POINTS, IS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO

NORMAL WAGE INCREASES AND SOME ADDED INFRASTRUCTURE NECESSARY TO

SUPPORT GLOBAL BUSINESS GROWTH, INCLUDING COSTS RELATED TO OUR

WORLDWIDE SUPPLY CHAIN INITIATIVE AND ADDITIONAL FACTORY OUTLET

STORES IN THE EMEA REGION.

OTHER EXPENSE, NET, WAS $74.7 MILLION FOR FISCAL 2004

COMPARED TO $77.5 MILLION IN FISCAL 2003. IN BOTH YEARS,

THE MOST SIGNIFICANT COMPONENT OF OTHER EXPENSE, NET, WAS

FOREIGN CURRENCY HEDGE LOSSES. THE HEDGE LOSSES REFLECT THAT THE

EURO STRENGTHENED CONSIDERABLY SINCE WE ENTERED INTO THESE HEDGE

CONTRACTS. ALSO INCLUDED IN OTHER EXPENSE, NET, FOR FISCAL 2004

WAS AN INCREASE IN NET LOSSES ON ASSET DISPOSALS, INCLUDING A

LOSS OF $5.3 MILLION ON LAND GIFTED TO THE NIKE FOUNDATION

IN THE FIRST QUARTER.

IN 2004, NET FOREIGN CURRENCY LOSSES IN OTHER EXPENSE, NET, WERE

MORE THAN OFFSET BY FAVORABLE TRANSLATION OF FOREIGN CURRENCY

DENOMINATED PROFITS, MOST SIGNIFICANTLY IN EMEA. OUR ESTIMATE OF

THE NET IMPACT OF THESE LOSSES AND THE FAVORABLE TRANSLATION IS

A $157 MILLION ADDITION TO CONSOLIDATED INCOME BEFORE

INCOME TAXES COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR.

OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR FISCAL 2004 WAS 34.8%, WHICH IS

HIGHER THAN THE FISCAL 2003 RATE OF 34.1% AS A RESULT OF A

HIGHER TAX PROVISION ON FOREIGN EARNINGS IN FISCAL 2004.

INCLUDED IN NET INCOME FOR FISCAL 2003 WAS A $266.1 MILLION

CHARGE FOR THE CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF IMPLEMENTING STATEMENT OF

FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARD (SFAS) NO. 142,

GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS,

(FAS 142). THIS CHARGE RELATED TO THE IMPAIRMENT OF

GOODWILL AND TRADEMARKS ASSOCIATED WITH BAUER NIKE HOCKEY AND

THE GOODWILL OF COLE HAAN, REFLECTING THAT THE FAIR VALUES WE

ESTIMATED FOR THESE ASSETS WERE LESS THAN THE CARRYING VALUES.

STATEMENTS (NOTE 4  IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE

ASSETS AND GOODWILL)

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION.

OPERATING SEGMENTS

FOR EMEA, CHANGES IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES ACCOUNTED

FOR 17 PERCENTAGE POINTS OF THE REPORTED INCREASE IN

REVENUES IN FISCAL 2004. THE REMAINING INCREASE OVER THE PRIOR

YEAR WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY NIKE-OWNED RETAIL (DUE TO THE

ADDITION OF NEW STORES IN FISCAL 2004) AND INCREASED FOOTWEAR

VOLUME (LED BY SOCCER PRODUCTS). EXCLUDING THE IMPACT OF

CURRENCY EXCHANGE MOVEMENTS, SALES IN EACH EMEA BUSINESS UNIT

GREW VERSUS FISCAL 2003.

EMEA PRE-TAX INCOME FOR FISCAL 2004 WAS $744.0 MILLION, UP

43% VERSUS THE PRIOR YEAR. HIGHER REVENUES AND GROSS MARGIN

IMPROVEMENTS DROVE THE INCREASE, MORE THAN OFFSETTING

INCREMENTAL SELLING AND

21

TABLE OF CONTENTS

ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS. THE IMPROVED GROSS MARGINS WERE PRIMARILY

THE RESULT OF IMPROVED YEAR-OVER-YEAR HEDGE RATES AND HIGHER

IN-LINE AND CLOSEOUT PRICING MARGINS.

IN THE ASIA PACIFIC REGION, FISCAL 2004 REVENUES INCREASED 20%

YEAR-OVER-YEAR. EIGHT PERCENTAGE POINTS OF GROWTH FOR THE FISCAL

YEAR WERE DUE TO CHANGES IN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES. EXCLUDING

THE IMPACT OF CURRENCY EXCHANGE MOVEMENTS, SALES IN EACH ASIA

PACIFIC BUSINESS UNIT GREW VERSUS FISCAL 2003. THE REGIONS

REVENUE GROWTH WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO UNIT VOLUME INCREASES, WITH

SIGNIFICANT REVENUE GROWTH IN CHINA (DRIVEN BY EXPANSION OF

RETAIL DISTRIBUTION AND STRONG CONSUMER DEMAND) AND JAPAN

(DRIVEN BY STRONG CONSUMER DEMAND).

PRE-TAX INCOME FOR THE ASIA PACIFIC REGION INCREASED TO

$352.3 MILLION IN FISCAL 2004, UP 22% VERSUS FISCAL 2003.

HIGHER REVENUES AND GROSS MARGIN IMPROVEMENTS DROVE THE

INCREASE, MORE THAN OFFSETTING INCREMENTAL SELLING AND

ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS. THE HIGHER GROSS MARGINS WERE PRIMARILY

ATTRIBUTABLE TO HIGHER IN-LINE PRICING MARGINS AND THE BENEFIT

OF BETTER HEDGE RATES ON PRODUCT PURCHASES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY

LOWER PROFITABILITY OF CLOSEOUTS.

IN THE AMERICAS REGION, REVENUES INCREASED 19% COMPARED TO

FISCAL 2003, WITH 8 PERCENTAGE POINTS OF THE GROWTH DUE TO

CHANGES IN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES. EXCLUDING THE CURRENCY

EFFECTS, THE REVENUE GROWTH WAS DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY STRONGER

CONSUMER DEMAND IN SOUTH AMERICA AND SALES IN EACH AMERICAS

BUSINESS UNIT GREW VERSUS FISCAL 2003.

IN FISCAL 2004, PRE-TAX INCOME FOR THE AMERICAS REGION INCREASED

6% FROM THE PRIOR YEAR, TO $97.4 MILLION. THE INCREASE IN

PRE-TAX INCOME WAS ATTRIBUTABLE TO CHANGES IN CURRENCY EXCHANGE

RATES SLIGHTLY OFFSET BY REDUCED GROSS MARGINS AND HIGHER

SELLING AND ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS. GROSS MARGINS FELL DUE TO

LOWER IN-LINE PRICING MARGINS AS WELL AS WEAKER CURRENCY

EXCHANGE RATES IN MEXICO.

IN THE U.S. REGION, REVENUES FOR FISCAL 2004 GREW 3% VERSUS

FISCAL 2003, AS REVENUES INCREASED IN EACH BUSINESS UNIT. THE

INCREASE IN APPAREL SALES WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY GROWTH IN

SPORT PERFORMANCE PRODUCT AND INCREASED CONSUMER DEMAND FOR TEAM

LICENSED APPAREL PRIMARILY IN THE FIRST HALF OF FISCAL 2004.

THE INCREASE IN FOOTWEAR REVENUE WAS DUE TO AN INCREASE IN

AVERAGE WHOLESALE SELLING PRICE PER PAIR AND INCREASED SALES IN

NIKE-OWNED RETAIL STORES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A SLIGHT DECLINE

IN WHOLESALE UNIT SALES. THE INCREASE IN AVERAGE WHOLESALE

SELLING PRICE PER PAIR WAS PARTIALLY DUE TO A LARGER PERCENTAGE

OF SALES OF PRODUCTS WITH A SUGGESTED RETAIL PRICE OVER $100.

THE SLIGHT DECLINE IN U.S. FOOTWEAR WHOLESALE UNIT SALES

WAS LARGELY DUE TO CHANGES IN DISTRIBUTION TO SEVERAL RETAIL

CUSTOMERS. FOR THE FIRST HALF OF THE YEAR, SALES TO OUR LARGEST

CUSTOMER, FOOT LOCKER, WERE LOWER AS A RESULT OF CHANGES TO OUR

DISTRIBUTION STRATEGY IMPLEMENTED IN FISCAL 2002 AND 2003; WHILE

THE DECLINE IN FIRST HALF SALES RESULTED IN SLIGHTLY LOWER SALES

FOR THE FULL YEAR, OUR YEAR-OVER-YEAR SALES TO FOOT LOCKER GREW

IN THE SECOND HALF OF FISCAL 2004. IN ADDITION, FISCAL 2004

SALES DECLINED FOR ANOTHER LARGE CUSTOMER, FOOTSTAR, WHICH

DECLARED BANKRUPTCY IN MARCH 2004. THE SALES DECLINES FOR FOOT

LOCKER AND FOOTSTAR WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY INCREASED SALES TO

OTHER ACCOUNTS.

FOR FISCAL 2004, PRE-TAX INCOME FOR THE U.S. REGION WAS

$1,007.3 MILLION, A 6% INCREASE VERSUS FISCAL 2003.

HIGHER REVENUES AND GROSS MARGINS DROVE THE INCREASE, MORE THAN

OFFSETTING HIGHER SELLING AND ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS. THE IMPROVED

GROSS MARGINS WERE PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF HIGHER IN-LINE AND

CLOSEOUT PRICING MARGINS AND EXPANDED RETAIL MARGINS.

REVENUES FOR OTHER BUSINESSES GREW 45% IN FISCAL 2004 COMPARED

TO FISCAL 2003; THE ADDITION OF CONVERSE CONTRIBUTED

23 PERCENTAGE POINTS OF THE INCREASE. THE REMAINDER OF THE

INCREASE WAS DUE TO REVENUE GROWTH AT NIKE GOLF, COLE HAAN,

HURLEY AND BAUER NIKE HOCKEY.

PRE-TAX INCOME FOR OTHER BUSINESSES IMPROVED TO

$75.3 MILLION IN FISCAL 2004, VERSUS INCOME OF

$7.9 MILLION IN FISCAL 2003. THE ADDITION OF CONVERSE,

COMBINED WITH IMPROVED RESULTS FROM NIKE GOLF AND COLE HAAN,

DROVE THE YEAR-OVER-YEAR IMPROVEMENT.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

FISCAL 2005 CASH FLOW ACTIVITY

CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATIONS WAS $1.6 BILLION IN FISCAL

2005, COMPARED TO $1.5 BILLION IN FISCAL 2004. OUR PRIMARY

SOURCE OF OPERATING CASH FLOW WAS NET INCOME OF

$1.2 BILLION. IN FISCAL 2005, CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATIONS

WAS NOT SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTED BY THE NET CHANGE IN WORKING

CAPITAL. IN FISCAL 2004, A NET DECREASE IN WORKING CAPITAL

PROVIDED $193.2 MILLION IN CASH FLOW PRIMARILY DUE TO

IMPROVED CASH MANAGEMENT OF OUR ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND TIMING

OF INVENTORY RECEIPTS AND VENDOR PAYMENTS.

CASH USED BY INVESTING ACTIVITIES DURING FISCAL 2005 WAS

$360.4 MILLION, COMPARED TO $950.6 MILLION INVESTED

DURING FISCAL 2004. THE MOST SIGNIFICANT USES OF CASH FOR

INVESTING ACTIVITIES IN FISCAL 2005 WERE NET ADDITIONS TO

PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT OF $250 MILLION, AND A NET

INCREASE IN SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS (PURCHASES PARTIALLY OFFSET

BY THE MATURITIES). THE ADDITIONS TO PROPERTY, PLANT AND

EQUIPMENT REFLECT CAPITAL EXPENDITURES ON COMPUTER EQUIPMENT AND

SOFTWARE (TO SUPPORT BOTH NORMAL BUSINESS OPERATIONS AND OUR

SUPPLY CHAIN SYSTEMS UPGRADE), AND CONTINUED INVESTMENT IN

NIKE-OWNED RETAIL STORES. THE IMPROVEMENT OVER THE PRIOR YEAR

WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER NET PURCHASES OF SHORT-TERM

INVESTMENTS AND LOWER COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE ACQUISITION OF

SUBSIDIARIES.

IN FISCAL 2005 AND SINCE INCEPTION OF OUR CURRENT SHARE

REPURCHASE PROGRAM, WE PURCHASED APPROXIMATELY 6.9 MILLION

SHARES OF NIKES CLASS B COMMON STOCK FOR

$556.2 MILLION. THE SHARE REPURCHASES WERE PART OF A

FOUR-YEAR $1.5 BILLION SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM THAT WAS

APPROVED BY THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS IN JUNE 2004. WE EXPECT TO

CONTINUE TO FUND THIS PROGRAM FROM OPERATING CASH FLOW. THE

TIMING AND THE ULTIMATE AMOUNT OF SHARES PURCHASED UNDER THE

PROGRAM WILL BE DICTATED BY OUR CAPITAL NEEDS AND STOCK MARKET

CONDITIONS.

DIVIDENDS DECLARED PER SHARE OF COMMON STOCK FOR FISCAL 2005

WERE $0.95, COMPARED TO $0.74 IN FISCAL 2004. WE HAVE PAID A

DIVIDEND EVERY QUARTER SINCE FEBRUARY 1984. OUR CURRENT DIVIDEND

POLICY IS TO PROVIDE AN ANNUAL DIVIDEND EQUAL TO 20% TO 30% OF

THE TRAILING TWELVE-MONTHS EARNINGS PER SHARE PAID OUT ON

A QUARTERLY BASIS. WE REVIEW OUR DIVIDEND POLICY FROM TIME TO

TIME, AND BASED UPON CURRENT PROJECTED EARNINGS AND CASH FLOW

REQUIREMENTS WE ANTICIPATE CONTINUING TO PAY A QUARTERLY

DIVIDEND IN THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE.

THE AMOUNTS LISTED FOR ENDORSEMENT CONTRACTS REPRESENT

APPROXIMATE AMOUNTS OF BASE COMPENSATION AND MINIMUM GUARANTEED

ROYALTY FEES WE ARE OBLIGATED TO PAY ATHLETE AND SPORT TEAM

ENDORSERS OF OUR PRODUCTS. ACTUAL PAYMENTS UNDER SOME CONTRACTS

MAY BE HIGHER THAN THE AMOUNTS LISTED AS THESE CONTRACTS PROVIDE

FOR BONUSES TO BE PAID TO THE ENDORSERS BASED UPON ATHLETIC

ACHIEVEMENTS AND/OR ROYALTIES ON PRODUCT SALES IN FUTURE

PERIODS. ACTUAL PAYMENTS UNDER SOME CONTRACTS MAY ALSO BE LOWER

AS THESE CONTRACTS INCLUDE PROVISIONS FOR REDUCED PAYMENTS IF

ATHLETIC PERFORMANCE DECLINES IN FUTURE PERIODS.

IN ADDITION TO THE CASH PAYMENTS, WE ARE OBLIGATED TO FURNISH

THE ENDORSERS WITH NIKE PRODUCTS FOR THEIR USE. IT IS NOT

POSSIBLE TO DETERMINE HOW MUCH WE WILL SPEND ON THIS PRODUCT ON

AN ANNUAL BASIS AS THE CONTRACTS DO NOT STIPULATE A SPECIFIC

AMOUNT OF CASH TO BE SPENT ON THE PRODUCT. THE AMOUNT OF PRODUCT

23

TABLE OF CONTENTS

PROVIDED TO THE ENDORSERS WILL DEPEND ON MANY FACTORS INCLUDING

GENERAL PLAYING CONDITIONS, THE NUMBER OF SPORTING EVENTS IN

WHICH THEY PARTICIPATE, AND OUR OWN DECISIONS REGARDING PRODUCT

AND MARKETING INITIATIVES. IN ADDITION, THE COSTS TO DESIGN,

DEVELOP, SOURCE, AND PURCHASE THE PRODUCTS FURNISHED TO THE

ENDORSERS ARE INCURRED OVER A PERIOD OF TIME AND ARE NOT

NECESSARILY TRACKED SEPARATELY FROM SIMILAR COSTS INCURRED FOR

PRODUCTS SOLD TO CUSTOMERS.

(2)

WE GENERALLY ORDER PRODUCT FOUR TO FIVE MONTHS IN ADVANCE OF

SALE BASED PRIMARILY ON ADVANCED FUTURES ORDERS RECEIVED FROM

CUSTOMERS. THE AMOUNTS LISTED FOR PRODUCT PURCHASE OBLIGATIONS

REPRESENT AGREEMENTS (INCLUDING OPEN PURCHASE ORDERS) TO

PURCHASE PRODUCTS IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS, THAT ARE

ENFORCEABLE AND LEGALLY BINDING AND THAT SPECIFY ALL SIGNIFICANT

TERMS. IN SOME CASES, PRICES ARE SUBJECT TO CHANGE THROUGHOUT

THE PRODUCTION PROCESS. THE REPORTED AMOUNTS EXCLUDE PRODUCT

PURCHASE LIABILITIES INCLUDED IN ACCOUNTS PAYABLE ON THE

CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET.

(3)

OTHER AMOUNTS PRIMARILY INCLUDE SERVICE AND MARKETING

COMMITMENTS MADE IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS. THE AMOUNTS

REPRESENT THE MINIMUM PAYMENTS REQUIRED BY LEGALLY BINDING

CONTRACTS AND AGREEMENTS, INCLUDING OPEN PURCHASE ORDERS FOR

NON-PRODUCT PURCHASES. THE REPORTED AMOUNTS EXCLUDE THOSE

LIABILITIES INCLUDED IN ACCOUNTS PAYABLE OR ACCRUED LIABILITIES

ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET.

EXCLUDED FROM THE TABLE ABOVE IS A COMMITMENT TO AN OUTSOURCING

CONTRACTOR THAT PROVIDES US WITH INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY

OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT SERVICES THROUGH FISCAL 2006. THE AMOUNT

OF THE PAYMENTS IN FUTURE YEARS DEPENDS ON OUR LEVEL OF MONTHLY

USE OF THE DIFFERENT ELEMENTS OF THE CONTRACTORS SERVICES.

IF WE WERE TO TERMINATE THE ENTIRE CONTRACT AS OF MAY 31,

2005, WE WOULD BE REQUIRED TO PROVIDE THE CONTRACTOR WITH FOUR

MONTHS NOTICE AND PAY A TERMINATION FEE OF

$13.4 MILLION. OUR MONTHLY PAYMENTS TO THE CONTRACTOR

CURRENTLY APPROXIMATE $7 MILLION. SUBSEQUENT TO

MAY 31, 2005, WE EXTENDED THIS CONTRACT THROUGH FISCAL 2008

WITH SUBSTANTIALLY THE SAME TERMS AS NOTED ABOVE; HOWEVER, THE

TERMINATION FEE INCREASED TO APPROXIMATELY $19 MILLION UPON

EXECUTION OF THE RENEWED CONTRACT AND OUR ESTIMATED MONTHLY

PAYMENTS DECREASED TO APPROXIMATELY $6 MILLION.

WE ALSO HAVE THE FOLLOWING OUTSTANDING SHORT-TERM DEBT

OBLIGATIONS AS OF MAY 31, 2005. PLEASE REFER TO THE

AS OF MAY 31, 2005, LETTERS OF CREDIT OF

$555.0 MILLION WERE OUTSTANDING, PRIMARILY FOR THE PURCHASE

OF INVENTORY. ALL LETTERS OF CREDIT GENERALLY EXPIRE WITHIN ONE

YEAR.

CAPITAL RESOURCES

IN OCTOBER 2001, WE FILED A SHELF REGISTRATION STATEMENT WITH

THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (SEC) UNDER

WHICH $1 BILLION IN DEBT SECURITIES MAY BE ISSUED. IN MAY

2002, WE COMMENCED A MEDIUM-TERM NOTE PROGRAM UNDER THE SHELF

REGISTRATION THAT ALLOWS US TO ISSUE UP TO $500 MILLION IN

MEDIUM-TERM NOTES, AS OUR CAPITAL NEEDS DICTATE. WE ENTERED INTO

THIS PROGRAM TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL LIQUIDITY TO MEET OUR WORKING

CAPITAL AND GENERAL CORPORATE CASH REQUIREMENTS. DURING FISCAL

2005, THERE WERE NO MEDIUM-TERM NOTES ISSUED UNDER THE PROGRAM.

IN PREVIOUS YEARS $240.0 MILLION IN MEDIUM-TERM NOTES WERE

ISSUED UNDER THE PROGRAM. CURRENTLY, $760 MILLION REMAINS

AVAILABLE TO BE ISSUED UNDER THE SHELF REGISTRATION. WE MAY

ISSUE ADDITIONAL NOTES UNDER THE SHELF REGISTRATION IN FISCAL

2006 DEPENDING ON GENERAL CORPORATE NEEDS.

AS OF MAY 31, 2005, WE HAD A MULTI-YEAR $750 MILLION

REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY IN PLACE WITH A GROUP OF BANKS, AND WE

CURRENTLY HAVE NO AMOUNTS OUTSTANDING UNDER THE FACILITY. THE

MATURITY DATE IS NOVEMBER 20,

24

TABLE OF CONTENTS

2008 AND THE FACILITY CAN BE EXTENDED FOR ONE ADDITIONAL YEAR ON

THE ANNIVERSARY DATE. BASED ON OUR CURRENT LONG-TERM SENIOR

UNSECURED DEBT RATINGS OF A+ AND A2 FROM STANDARD AND

POORS CORPORATION AND MOODYS INVESTOR SERVICES,

RESPECTIVELY, THE INTEREST RATE CHARGED ON ANY OUTSTANDING

BORROWINGS WOULD BE THE PREVAILING LIBOR PLUS 0.18%. THE

FACILITY FEE IS 0.07% OF THE TOTAL COMMITMENT.

IF OUR LONG-TERM DEBT RATING WERE TO DECLINE, THE FACILITY FEE

AND INTEREST RATE UNDER OUR COMMITTED CREDIT FACILITY WOULD

INCREASE. CONVERSELY, IF OUR LONG-TERM DEBT RATING WERE TO

IMPROVE, THE FACILITY FEE AND INTEREST RATE WOULD DECREASE.

CHANGES IN OUR LONG-TERM DEBT RATING WOULD NOT TRIGGER

ACCELERATION OF MATURITY OF ANY THEN OUTSTANDING BORROWINGS OR

ANY FUTURE BORROWINGS UNDER THE COMMITTED CREDIT FACILITIES.

UNDER THIS COMMITTED CREDIT FACILITY, WE HAVE AGREED TO VARIOUS

COVENANTS. THESE COVENANTS INCLUDE LIMITS ON OUR DISPOSAL OF

FIXED ASSETS AND THE AMOUNT OF DEBT SECURED BY LIENS WE MAY

INCUR, AND SET A MINIMUM CAPITALIZATION RATIO. IN THE EVENT WE

WERE TO HAVE ANY BORROWINGS OUTSTANDING UNDER THIS FACILITY,

FAILED TO MEET ANY COVENANT, AND WERE UNABLE TO OBTAIN A WAIVER

FROM A MAJORITY OF THE BANKS, ANY BORROWINGS WOULD BECOME

IMMEDIATELY DUE AND PAYABLE. AS OF MAY 31, 2005, WE WERE IN

FULL COMPLIANCE WITH EACH OF THESE COVENANTS AND BELIEVE IT IS

UNLIKELY WE WILL FAIL TO MEET ANY OF THESE COVENANTS IN THE

FORESEEABLE FUTURE.

LIQUIDITY IS ALSO PROVIDED BY OUR COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAM,

UNDER WHICH THERE WAS NO AMOUNT OUTSTANDING AT MAY 31, 2005

OR MAY 31, 2004. WE CURRENTLY HAVE SHORT-TERM DEBT RATINGS

OF A1 AND P1 FROM STANDARD AND POORS CORPORATION AND

MOODYS INVESTOR SERVICES, RESPECTIVELY.

WE CURRENTLY BELIEVE THAT CASH GENERATED BY OPERATIONS, TOGETHER

WITH ACCESS TO EXTERNAL SOURCES OF FUNDS AS DESCRIBED ABOVE,

WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO MEET OUR OPERATING AND CAPITAL NEEDS IN

THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE.

RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

IN NOVEMBER 2004, THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD

(FASB) ISSUED STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

(SFAS) NO. 151, INVENTORY COSTS, AN AMENDMENT OF

ARB NO. 43, CHAPTER 4 (FAS 151).

FAS 151 CLARIFIES THAT ABNORMAL INVENTORY COSTS SUCH AS

COSTS OF IDLE FACILITIES, EXCESS FREIGHT AND HANDLING COSTS, AND

WASTED MATERIALS (SPOILAGE) ARE REQUIRED TO BE RECOGNIZED

AS CURRENT PERIOD CHARGES. THE PROVISIONS OF

SFAS NO. 151 ARE EFFECTIVE FOR OUR FISCAL YEAR

BEGINNING JUNE 1, 2006. WE ARE CURRENTLY EVALUATING THE

PROVISIONS OF FAS 151 AND DO NOT EXPECT THAT THE ADOPTION

WILL HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

POSITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

ON DECEMBER 16, 2004, THE FASB FINALIZED

SFAS NO. 123R SHARE BASED PAYMENT,

(FAS 123R) WHICH, AFTER THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE

COMMISSION (SEC) AMENDED THE COMPLIANCE DATES ON

APRIL 15, 2005, WILL BE EFFECTIVE FOR OUR FISCAL YEAR

BEGINNING JUNE 1, 2006. THE NEW STANDARD WILL REQUIRE US TO

RECORD COMPENSATION EXPENSE FOR STOCK OPTIONS USING A FAIR VALUE

METHOD. ON MARCH 29, 2005, THE SEC ISSUED STAFF ACCOUNTING

BULLETIN NO. 107 (SAB 107), WHICH PROVIDES THE

STAFFS VIEWS REGARDING INTERACTIONS BETWEEN FAS 123R

AND CERTAIN SEC RULES AND REGULATIONS AND PROVIDES

INTERPRETATIONS OF THE VALUATION OF SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS FOR

PUBLIC COMPANIES.

WE ARE CURRENTLY EVALUATING FAS 123R AND SAB 107 TO

DETERMINE THE FAIR VALUE METHOD TO MEASURE COMPENSATION EXPENSE,

THE APPROPRIATE ASSUMPTIONS TO INCLUDE IN THE FAIR VALUE MODEL

AND THE TRANSITION METHOD TO USE UPON ADOPTION. THE IMPACT OF

THE ADOPTION OF FAS 123R IS NOT KNOWN AT THIS TIME DUE TO

THESE FACTORS AS WELL AS THE UNKNOWN LEVEL OF SHARE-BASED

PAYMENTS GRANTED IN FUTURE YEARS. THE EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS OF EXPENSING STOCK OPTIONS USING THE BLACK-SCHOLES

MODEL IS PRESENTED IN THE ACCOMPANYING

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (NOTE 1  SIGNIFICANT

ACCOUNTING POLICIES).

UNDER CERTAIN CONDITIONS, STOCK OPTIONS GRANTED BY THE COMPANY

ARE ELIGIBLE FOR ACCELERATED VESTING UPON THE RETIREMENT OF THE

EMPLOYEE. THE FASB CLARIFIED IN FAS 123R THAT THE FAIR

VALUE OF SUCH STOCK OPTIONS SHOULD BE EXPENSED BASED ON AN

ACCELERATED VESTING SCHEDULE OR IMMEDIATELY, RATHER THAN RATABLY

OVER THE VESTING PERIOD STATED IN THE GRANT. OUR PRO FORMA

DISCLOSURE CURRENTLY REFLECTS THE EXPENSE OF SUCH OPTIONS

RATABLY OVER THE STATED VESTING PERIOD, EXPENSING ALL UNVESTED

SHARES UPON ACTUAL RETIREMENT. THE SEC HAS RECENTLY CLARIFIED

THAT COMPANIES SHOULD CONTINUE TO FOLLOW THE VESTING METHOD THEY

HAVE BEEN USING UNTIL ADOPTION OF FAS 123R, THEN APPLY THE

ACCELERATED VESTING SCHEDULE TO ALL SUBSEQUENT GRANTS TO THOSE

EMPLOYEES ELIGIBLE FOR ACCELERATED VESTING UPON RETIREMENT. HAD

WE BEEN ACCOUNTING FOR SUCH STOCK OPTIONS

25

TABLE OF CONTENTS

USING THE ACCELERATED VESTING SCHEDULE FOR THOSE EMPLOYEES

ELIGIBLE FOR ACCELERATED VESTING UPON RETIREMENT, WE WOULD HAVE

RECOGNIZED ADDITIONAL STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE IN OUR

PRO FORMA DISCLOSURE OF THE EFFECT OF EXPENSING STOCK OPTIONS

PRESENTED IN THE ACCOMPANYING

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS (NOTE 1  SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING

POLICIES)

OF $0.05 PER DILUTED SHARE IN FISCAL 2005,

2004 AND 2003.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

OUR PREVIOUS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION

AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS ARE BASED UPON OUR CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, WHICH HAVE BEEN PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE

WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED

STATES OF AMERICA. THE PREPARATION OF THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

REQUIRES US TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS THAT AFFECT THE

REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS, LIABILITIES, REVENUES AND EXPENSES,

AND RELATED DISCLOSURE OF CONTINGENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES.

WE BELIEVE THAT THE ESTIMATES, ASSUMPTIONS AND JUDGMENTS

INVOLVED IN THE ACCOUNTING POLICIES DESCRIBED BELOW HAVE THE

GREATEST POTENTIAL IMPACT ON OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, SO WE

CONSIDER THESE TO BE OUR CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES. BECAUSE

OF THE UNCERTAINTY INHERENT IN THESE MATTERS, ACTUAL RESULTS

COULD DIFFER FROM THE ESTIMATES WE USE IN APPLYING THE CRITICAL

ACCOUNTING POLICIES. CERTAIN OF THESE CRITICAL ACCOUNTING

POLICIES AFFECT WORKING CAPITAL ACCOUNT BALANCES, INCLUDING THE

POLICIES FOR REVENUE RECOGNITION, THE RESERVE FOR UNCOLLECTIBLE

ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, INVENTORY RESERVES, AND CONTINGENT PAYMENTS

UNDER ENDORSEMENT CONTRACTS. THESE POLICIES REQUIRE THAT WE MAKE

ESTIMATES IN THE PREPARATION OF OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AS OF A

GIVEN DATE. HOWEVER, SINCE OUR BUSINESS CYCLE IS RELATIVELY

SHORT, ACTUAL RESULTS RELATED TO THESE ESTIMATES ARE GENERALLY

KNOWN WITHIN THE SIX-MONTH PERIOD FOLLOWING THE FINANCIAL

STATEMENT DATE. THUS, THESE POLICIES GENERALLY AFFECT ONLY THE

TIMING OF REPORTED AMOUNTS ACROSS TWO TO THREE QUARTERS.

WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF THESE CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES, WE ARE

NOT CURRENTLY AWARE OF ANY REASONABLY LIKELY EVENTS OR

CIRCUMSTANCES THAT WOULD RESULT IN MATERIALLY DIFFERENT AMOUNTS

BEING REPORTED.

REVENUE RECOGNITION

WE RECORD WHOLESALE REVENUES WHEN TITLE PASSES AND THE RISKS AND

REWARDS OF OWNERSHIP HAVE PASSED TO THE CUSTOMER, BASED ON THE

TERMS OF SALE. TITLE PASSES GENERALLY UPON SHIPMENT OR UPON

RECEIPT BY THE CUSTOMER DEPENDING ON THE COUNTRY OF THE SALE AND

THE AGREEMENT WITH THE CUSTOMER. RETAIL STORE REVENUES ARE

RECORDED AT THE TIME OF SALE.

IN SOME INSTANCES, WE SHIP PRODUCT DIRECTLY FROM OUR SUPPLIER TO

THE CUSTOMER AND RECOGNIZE REVENUE WHEN THE PRODUCT IS DELIVERED

TO AND ACCEPTED BY THE CUSTOMER. OUR REVENUES MAY FLUCTUATE IN

CASES WHEN OUR CUSTOMERS DELAY ACCEPTING SHIPMENT OF PRODUCT FOR

PERIODS UP TO SEVERAL WEEKS.

IN CERTAIN COUNTRIES OUTSIDE OF THE U.S., PRECISE INFORMATION

REGARDING THE DATE OF RECEIPT BY THE CUSTOMER IS NOT READILY

AVAILABLE. IN THESE CASES, WE ESTIMATE THE DATE OF RECEIPT BY

THE CUSTOMER BASED UPON HISTORICAL DELIVERY TIMES BY GEOGRAPHIC

LOCATION. ON THE BASIS OF OUR TESTS OF ACTUAL TRANSACTIONS, WE

HAVE NO INDICATION THAT THESE ESTIMATES HAVE BEEN MATERIALLY

INACCURATE HISTORICALLY.

AS PART OF OUR REVENUE RECOGNITION POLICY, WE RECORD ESTIMATED

SALES RETURNS AND MISCELLANEOUS CLAIMS FROM CUSTOMERS AS

REDUCTIONS TO REVENUES AT THE TIME REVENUES ARE RECORDED. WE

BASE OUR ESTIMATES ON HISTORICAL RATES OF PRODUCT RETURNS AND

CLAIMS, AND SPECIFIC IDENTIFICATION OF OUTSTANDING CLAIMS AND

OUTSTANDING RETURNS NOT YET RECEIVED FROM CUSTOMERS. ACTUAL

RETURNS AND CLAIMS IN ANY FUTURE PERIOD ARE INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN

AND THUS MAY DIFFER FROM OUR ESTIMATES. IF ACTUAL OR EXPECTED

FUTURE RETURNS AND CLAIMS WERE SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER OR LOWER

THAN THE RESERVES WE HAD ESTABLISHED, WE WOULD RECORD A

REDUCTION OR INCREASE TO NET REVENUES IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH WE

MADE SUCH DETERMINATION.

RESERVE FOR UNCOLLECTIBLE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE

WE MAKE ONGOING ESTIMATES RELATING TO THE COLLECTIBILITY OF OUR

ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND MAINTAIN A RESERVE FOR ESTIMATED LOSSES

RESULTING FROM THE INABILITY OF OUR CUSTOMERS TO MAKE REQUIRED

PAYMENTS. IN DETERMINING THE AMOUNT OF THE RESERVE, WE CONSIDER

OUR HISTORICAL LEVEL OF CREDIT LOSSES AND MAKE JUDGMENTS ABOUT

THE CREDITWORTHINESS OF SIGNIFICANT CUSTOMERS BASED ON ONGOING

CREDIT EVALUATIONS. SINCE WE CANNOT PREDICT FUTURE

26

TABLE OF CONTENTS

CHANGES IN THE FINANCIAL STABILITY OF OUR CUSTOMERS, ACTUAL

FUTURE LOSSES FROM UNCOLLECTIBLE ACCOUNTS MAY DIFFER FROM OUR

ESTIMATES. IF THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF OUR CUSTOMERS WERE TO

DETERIORATE, RESULTING IN THEIR INABILITY TO MAKE PAYMENTS, A

LARGER RESERVE MIGHT BE REQUIRED. IN THE EVENT WE DETERMINED

THAT A SMALLER OR LARGER RESERVE WAS APPROPRIATE, WE WOULD

RECORD A CREDIT OR A CHARGE TO SELLING AND ADMINISTRATIVE

EXPENSE IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH WE MADE SUCH A DETERMINATION.

INVENTORY RESERVES

WE ALSO MAKE ONGOING ESTIMATES RELATING TO THE NET REALIZABLE

VALUE OF INVENTORIES, BASED UPON OUR ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT FUTURE

DEMAND AND MARKET CONDITIONS. IF WE ESTIMATE THAT THE NET

REALIZABLE VALUE OF OUR INVENTORY IS LESS THAN THE COST OF THE

INVENTORY RECORDED ON OUR BOOKS, WE RECORD A RESERVE EQUAL TO

THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE COST OF THE INVENTORY AND THE

ESTIMATED NET REALIZABLE VALUE. THIS RESERVE IS RECORDED AS A

CHARGE TO COST OF SALES. IF CHANGES IN MARKET CONDITIONS RESULT

IN REDUCTIONS IN THE ESTIMATED NET REALIZABLE VALUE OF OUR

INVENTORY BELOW OUR PREVIOUS ESTIMATE, WE WOULD INCREASE OUR

RESERVE IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH WE MADE SUCH A DETERMINATION AND

RECORD A CHARGE TO COST OF SALES.

CONTINGENT PAYMENTS UNDER ENDORSEMENT CONTRACTS

A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR DEMAND CREATION EXPENSE RELATES TO

PAYMENTS UNDER ENDORSEMENT CONTRACTS. IN GENERAL, ENDORSEMENT

PAYMENTS ARE EXPENSED UNIFORMLY OVER THE TERM OF THE CONTRACT.

HOWEVER, CERTAIN CONTRACT ELEMENTS MAY BE ACCOUNTED FOR

DIFFERENTLY, BASED UPON THE FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES OF EACH

INDIVIDUAL CONTRACT.

SOME OF THE CONTRACTS PROVIDE FOR CONTINGENT PAYMENTS TO

ENDORSERS BASED UPON SPECIFIC ACHIEVEMENTS IN THEIR SPORTS

(E.G., WINNING A CHAMPIONSHIP). WE RECORD SELLING AND

ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE FOR THESE AMOUNTS WHEN THE ENDORSER

ACHIEVES THE SPECIFIC GOAL.

SOME OF THE CONTRACTS PROVIDE FOR PAYMENTS BASED UPON ENDORSERS

MAINTAINING A LEVEL OF PERFORMANCE IN THEIR SPORT OVER AN

EXTENDED PERIOD OF TIME (E.G., MAINTAINING A TOP RANKING IN A

SPORT FOR A YEAR). THESE AMOUNTS ARE REPORTED IN SELLING AND

ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE WHEN WE DETERMINE THAT IT IS PROBABLE

THAT THE SPECIFIED LEVEL OF PERFORMANCE WILL BE MAINTAINED

THROUGHOUT THE PERIOD. IN THESE INSTANCES, TO THE EXTENT THAT

ACTUAL PAYMENTS TO THE ENDORSER DIFFER FROM OUR ESTIMATE DUE TO

CHANGES IN THE ENDORSERS ATHLETIC PERFORMANCE, INCREASED

OR DECREASED SELLING AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE MAY BE REPORTED

IN A FUTURE PERIOD.

SOME OF THE CONTRACTS PROVIDE FOR ROYALTY PAYMENTS TO ENDORSERS

BASED UPON A PREDETERMINED PERCENTAGE OF SALES OF PARTICULAR

PRODUCTS. WE EXPENSE THESE PAYMENTS IN COST OF SALES AS THE

RELATED SALES ARE MADE. IN CERTAIN CONTRACTS, WE OFFER MINIMUM

GUARANTEED ROYALTY PAYMENTS. FOR CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS FOR

WHICH WE ESTIMATE THAT WE WILL NOT MEET THE MINIMUM GUARANTEED

AMOUNT OF ROYALTY FEES THROUGH SALES OF PRODUCT, WE RECORD THE

AMOUNT OF THE GUARANTEED PAYMENT IN EXCESS OF THAT EARNED

THROUGH SALES OF PRODUCT IN SELLING AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE

UNIFORMLY OVER THE REMAINING GUARANTEE PERIOD.

PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT

PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT, INCLUDING BUILDINGS, EQUIPMENT,

AND COMPUTER HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE IS RECORDED AT COST

(INCLUDING, IN SOME CASES, THE COST OF INTERNAL LABOR) AND IS

DEPRECIATED OVER ITS ESTIMATED USEFUL LIFE. CHANGES IN

CIRCUMSTANCES (SUCH AS TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES OR CHANGES TO OUR

BUSINESS OPERATIONS) CAN RESULT IN DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE

ACTUAL AND ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES. IN THOSE CASES WHERE WE

DETERMINE THAT THE USEFUL LIFE OF A LONG-LIVED ASSET SHOULD BE

SHORTENED, WE INCREASE DEPRECIATION EXPENSE OVER THE REMAINING

USEFUL LIFE TO DEPRECIATE THE ASSETS NET BOOK VALUE TO ITS

SALVAGE VALUE.

WHEN EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THAT THE CARRYING VALUE OF

PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT MAY BE IMPAIRED, WE ESTIMATE THE

FUTURE UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS TO BE DERIVED FROM THE ASSET TO

DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT A POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT EXISTS. IF THE

CARRYING VALUE EXCEEDS OUR ESTIMATE OF FUTURE UNDISCOUNTED CASH

FLOWS, WE THEN CALCULATE THE IMPAIRMENT AS THE EXCESS OF THE

CARRYING VALUE OF THE ASSET OVER OUR ESTIMATE OF ITS FAIR MARKET

VALUE. ANY IMPAIRMENT CHARGES ARE RECORDED AS OTHER EXPENSE,

NET. WE ESTIMATE FUTURE UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS USING

ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT OUR EXPECTED FUTURE OPERATING PERFORMANCE. OUR

ESTIMATES OF UNDISCOUNTED

27

TABLE OF CONTENTS

CASH FLOWS MAY CHANGE IN FUTURE PERIODS DUE TO, AMONG OTHER

THINGS, TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGES, ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, CHANGES TO

OUR BUSINESS OPERATIONS OR INABILITY TO MEET BUSINESS PLANS.

SUCH CHANGES MAY RESULT IN IMPAIRMENT CHARGES IN THE PERIOD IN

WHICH SUCH CHANGES IN ESTIMATES ARE MADE.

GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS

WE ADOPTED FAS 142 EFFECTIVE FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF

FISCAL 2003. IN ACCORDANCE WITH FAS 142, GOODWILL AND

INTANGIBLE ASSETS WITH INDEFINITE LIVES ARE NO LONGER AMORTIZED

BUT INSTEAD MEASURED FOR IMPAIRMENT AT LEAST ANNUALLY IN THE

FOURTH QUARTER, OR WHEN EVENTS INDICATE THAT AN IMPAIRMENT

EXISTS. AS REQUIRED BY FAS 142, IN OUR IMPAIRMENT TESTS FOR

GOODWILL AND OTHER INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS, WE

COMPARE THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF GOODWILL AND OTHER

INTANGIBLE ASSETS TO THE CARRYING VALUE. IF THE CARRYING VALUE

EXCEEDS OUR ESTIMATE OF FAIR VALUE, WE CALCULATE IMPAIRMENT AS

THE EXCESS OF THE CARRYING VALUE OVER OUR ESTIMATE OF FAIR

VALUE. OUR ESTIMATES OF FAIR VALUE UTILIZED IN GOODWILL AND

OTHER INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSET TESTS MAY BE BASED UPON

A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING OUR ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT THE

EXPECTED FUTURE OPERATING PERFORMANCE OF OUR REPORTING UNITS.

OUR ESTIMATES MAY CHANGE IN FUTURE PERIODS DUE TO, AMONG OTHER

THINGS, TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE, ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, CHANGES TO

OUR BUSINESS OPERATIONS OR INABILITY TO MEET BUSINESS PLANS.

SUCH CHANGES MAY RESULT IN IMPAIRMENT CHARGES RECORDED IN FUTURE

PERIODS.

AS DISCUSSED FURTHER ABOVE, UPON ADOPTION OF FAS 142 IN

FISCAL 2003, WE RECORDED AN IMPAIRMENT CHARGE RELATED TO

GOODWILL AND OTHER INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS OF

$266.1 MILLION. THIS CHARGE IS SHOWN ON OUR CONSOLIDATED

STATEMENT OF INCOME AS THE CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF ACCOUNTING

CHANGE. SUBSEQUENT TO ADOPTION, ANY GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT CHARGES

WOULD BE CLASSIFIED AS A SEPARATE LINE ITEM ON OUR CONSOLIDATED

STATEMENT OF INCOME AS PART OF INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES AND

CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF ACCOUNTING CHANGE. OTHER INDEFINITE-LIVED

INTANGIBLE ASSET IMPAIRMENT CHARGES WOULD BE CLASSIFIED AS OTHER

EXPENSE, NET.

INTANGIBLE ASSETS THAT ARE DETERMINED TO HAVE DEFINITE LIVES ARE

AMORTIZED OVER THEIR USEFUL LIVES AND ARE MEASURED FOR

IMPAIRMENT ONLY WHEN EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THE

CARRYING VALUE MAY BE IMPAIRED. IN THESE CASES, WE ESTIMATE THE

FUTURE UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS TO BE DERIVED FROM THE ASSET TO

DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT A POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT EXISTS. IF THE

CARRYING VALUE EXCEEDS OUR ESTIMATE OF FUTURE UNDISCOUNTED CASH

FLOWS, WE THEN CALCULATE THE IMPAIRMENT AS THE EXCESS OF THE

CARRYING VALUE OF THE ASSET OVER OUR ESTIMATE OF ITS FAIR VALUE.

ANY IMPAIRMENT CHARGES WOULD BE CLASSIFIED AS OTHER EXPENSE, NET.

HEDGE ACCOUNTING FOR DERIVATIVES

WE USE FORWARD EXCHANGE CONTRACTS AND OPTION CONTRACTS TO HEDGE

CERTAIN ANTICIPATED FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE TRANSACTIONS, AS

WELL AS ANY RESULTING RECEIVABLE OR PAYABLE BALANCE. WHEN

SPECIFIC CRITERIA REQUIRED BY SFAS NO. 133,

ACCOUNTING FOR DERIVATIVE AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES, AS

AMENDED AND INTERPRETED (FAS 133) HAVE BEEN MET, CHANGES IN

FAIR VALUES OF HEDGE CONTRACTS RELATING TO ANTICIPATED

TRANSACTIONS ARE RECORDED IN OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME RATHER

THAN NET INCOME UNTIL THE UNDERLYING HEDGED TRANSACTION AFFECTS

NET INCOME. IN MOST CASES, THIS RESULTS IN GAINS AND LOSSES ON

HEDGE DERIVATIVES BEING RELEASED FROM OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME

INTO NET INCOME SOME TIME AFTER THE MATURITY OF THE DERIVATIVE.

ONE OF THE CRITERIA FOR THIS ACCOUNTING TREATMENT IS THAT THE

FORWARD EXCHANGE CONTRACT AMOUNT SHOULD NOT BE IN EXCESS OF

SPECIFICALLY IDENTIFIED ANTICIPATED TRANSACTIONS. BY THEIR VERY

NATURE, OUR ESTIMATES OF ANTICIPATED TRANSACTIONS MAY FLUCTUATE

OVER TIME AND MAY ULTIMATELY VARY FROM ACTUAL TRANSACTIONS. WHEN

ANTICIPATED TRANSACTION ESTIMATES OR ACTUAL TRANSACTION AMOUNTS

DECREASE BELOW HEDGED LEVELS, OR WHEN THE TIMING OF TRANSACTIONS

CHANGES SIGNIFICANTLY, WE ARE REQUIRED TO RECLASSIFY AT LEAST A

PORTION OF THE CUMULATIVE CHANGES IN FAIR VALUES OF THE RELATED

HEDGE CONTRACTS FROM OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME TO OTHER

EXPENSE, NET DURING THE QUARTER IN WHICH SUCH CHANGES OCCUR.

ONCE AN ANTICIPATED TRANSACTION ESTIMATE OR ACTUAL TRANSACTION

AMOUNT DECREASES BELOW HEDGED LEVELS, WE MAKE ADJUSTMENTS TO THE

RELATED HEDGE CONTRACT IN ORDER TO REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF THE

HEDGE CONTRACT TO THAT OF THE REVISED ANTICIPATED TRANSACTION.

TAXES

WE RECORD VALUATION ALLOWANCES AGAINST OUR DEFERRED TAX ASSETS,

WHEN NECESSARY, IN ACCORDANCE WITH SFAS NO. 109,

ACCOUNTING FOR INCOME TAXES. REALIZATION OF DEFERRED

TAX ASSETS (SUCH AS NET OPERATING LOSS

28

TABLE OF CONTENTS

CARRYFORWARDS) IS DEPENDENT ON FUTURE TAXABLE EARNINGS AND IS

THEREFORE UNCERTAIN. AT LEAST QUARTERLY, WE ASSESS THE

LIKELIHOOD THAT OUR DEFERRED TAX ASSET BALANCE WILL BE RECOVERED

FROM FUTURE TAXABLE INCOME. TO THE EXTENT WE BELIEVE THAT

RECOVERY IS NOT LIKELY, WE ESTABLISH A VALUATION ALLOWANCE

AGAINST OUR DEFERRED TAX ASSET, INCREASING OUR INCOME TAX

EXPENSE IN THE PERIOD SUCH DETERMINATION IS MADE.

IN ADDITION, WE HAVE NOT RECORDED U.S. INCOME TAX EXPENSE

FOR FOREIGN EARNINGS THAT WE HAVE DETERMINED TO BE INDEFINITELY

REINVESTED OFFSHORE, THUS REDUCING OUR OVERALL INCOME TAX

EXPENSE. THE AMOUNT OF EARNINGS DESIGNATED AS INDEFINITELY

REINVESTED OFFSHORE IS BASED UPON THE ACTUAL DEPLOYMENT OF SUCH

EARNINGS IN OUR OFFSHORE ASSETS AND OUR EXPECTATIONS OF THE

FUTURE CASH NEEDS OF OUR U.S. AND FOREIGN ENTITIES. INCOME TAX

CONSIDERATIONS ARE ALSO A FACTOR IN DETERMINING THE AMOUNT OF

FOREIGN EARNINGS TO BE INDEFINITELY REINVESTED OFFSHORE.

WE CAREFULLY REVIEW ALL FACTORS THAT DRIVE THE ULTIMATE

DISPOSITION OF FOREIGN EARNINGS DETERMINED TO BE REINVESTED

OFFSHORE, AND APPLY STRINGENT STANDARDS TO OVERCOMING THE

PRESUMPTION OF REPATRIATION. DESPITE THIS APPROACH, BECAUSE THE

DETERMINATION INVOLVES OUR FUTURE PLANS AND EXPECTATIONS OF

FUTURE EVENTS, THE POSSIBILITY EXISTS THAT AMOUNTS DECLARED AS

INDEFINITELY REINVESTED OFFSHORE MAY ULTIMATELY BE REPATRIATED.

FOR INSTANCE, THE ACTUAL CASH NEEDS OF OUR U.S. ENTITIES

MAY EXCEED OUR CURRENT EXPECTATIONS, OR THE ACTUAL CASH NEEDS OF

OUR FOREIGN ENTITIES MAY BE LESS THAN OUR CURRENT EXPECTATIONS.

THIS WOULD RESULT IN ADDITIONAL INCOME TAX EXPENSE IN THE YEAR

WE DETERMINED THAT AMOUNTS WERE NO LONGER INDEFINITELY

REINVESTED OFFSHORE. CONVERSELY, OUR APPROACH MAY ALSO RESULT IN

A DETERMINATION THAT ACCUMULATED FOREIGN EARNINGS (FOR WHICH

U.S. INCOME TAXES HAVE BEEN PROVIDED) WILL BE INDEFINITELY

REINVESTED OFFSHORE. IN THIS CASE, OUR INCOME TAX EXPENSE WOULD

BE REDUCED IN THE YEAR OF SUCH DETERMINATION.

ON AN INTERIM BASIS, WE ESTIMATE WHAT OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE

WILL BE FOR THE FULL FISCAL YEAR. THE ESTIMATED ANNUAL EFFECTIVE

TAX RATE IS THEN APPLIED TO THE YEAR-TO-DATE PRE-TAX INCOME

EXCLUDING SIGNIFICANT OR INFREQUENTLY OCCURRING ITEMS, TO

DETERMINE THE YEAR-TO-DATE TAX EXPENSE. THE INCOME TAX EFFECTS

OF INFREQUENT OR UNUSUAL ITEMS ARE RECOGNIZED IN THE INTERIM

PERIOD IN WHICH THEY OCCUR. AS THE FISCAL YEAR PROGRESSES, WE

CONTINUALLY REFINE OUR ESTIMATE BASED UPON ACTUAL EVENTS AND

EARNINGS BY JURISDICTION DURING THE YEAR. THIS CONTINUAL

ESTIMATION PROCESS PERIODICALLY RESULTS IN A CHANGE TO OUR

EXPECTED EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR THE FISCAL YEAR. WHEN THIS

OCCURS, WE ADJUST THE INCOME TAX PROVISION DURING THE QUARTER IN

WHICH THE CHANGE IN ESTIMATE OCCURS SO THAT THE YEAR-TO-DATE

PROVISION EQUALS THE EXPECTED ANNUAL RATE.

OTHER CONTINGENCIES

IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS, WE ARE INVOLVED IN LEGAL

PROCEEDINGS REGARDING CONTRACTUAL AND EMPLOYMENT RELATIONSHIPS,

PRODUCT LIABILITY CLAIMS, TRADEMARK RIGHTS, AND A VARIETY OF

OTHER MATTERS. WE RECORD CONTINGENT LIABILITIES RESULTING FROM

CLAIMS AGAINST US, INCLUDING RELATED LEGAL COSTS, WHEN IT IS

PROBABLE THAT A LIABILITY HAS BEEN INCURRED AND THE AMOUNT OF

THE LOSS IS REASONABLY ESTIMABLE. WE DISCLOSE CONTINGENT

LIABILITIES WHEN THERE IS A REASONABLE POSSIBILITY THAT THE

ULTIMATE LOSS WILL MATERIALLY EXCEED THE RECORDED LIABILITY.

ESTIMATING PROBABLE LOSSES REQUIRES ANALYSIS OF MULTIPLE

FACTORS, IN SOME CASES INCLUDING JUDGMENTS ABOUT THE POTENTIAL

ACTIONS OF THIRD PARTY CLAIMANTS AND COURTS. THEREFORE, ACTUAL

LOSSES IN ANY FUTURE PERIOD ARE INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN. CURRENTLY,

WE DO NOT BELIEVE THAT ANY OF OUR PENDING LEGAL PROCEEDINGS OR

CLAIMS WILL HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR FINANCIAL POSITION OR

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. HOWEVER, IF ACTUAL OR ESTIMATED PROBABLE

FUTURE LOSSES EXCEED OUR RECORDED LIABILITY FOR SUCH CLAIMS, WE

WOULD RECORD ADDITIONAL CHARGES AS OTHER EXPENSE, NET DURING THE

PERIOD IN WHICH THE ACTUAL LOSS OR CHANGE IN ESTIMATE OCCURRED.

ITEM 7A.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET

RISK

IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS AND CONSISTENT WITH ESTABLISHED

POLICIES AND PROCEDURES, WE EMPLOY A VARIETY OF FINANCIAL

INSTRUMENTS TO MANAGE EXPOSURE TO FLUCTUATIONS IN THE VALUE OF

FOREIGN CURRENCIES AND INTEREST RATES. IT IS OUR POLICY TO

UTILIZE THESE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS ONLY WHERE NECESSARY TO

FINANCE OUR BUSINESS AND MANAGE SUCH EXPOSURES; WE DO NOT ENTER

INTO THESE TRANSACTIONS FOR SPECULATIVE PURPOSES.

WE ARE EXPOSED TO FOREIGN CURRENCY FLUCTUATION AS A RESULT OF

OUR INTERNATIONAL SALES, PRODUCT SOURCING AND FUNDING

ACTIVITIES. OUR FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVE IS TO

REDUCE THE VARIABILITY OF LOCAL ENTITY CASH FLOWS AS A RESULT OF

EXCHANGE RATE MOVEMENTS. WE USE FORWARD EXCHANGE CONTRACTS AND

OPTIONS TO HEDGE

29

TABLE OF CONTENTS

CERTAIN ANTICIPATED BUT NOT YET FIRMLY COMMITTED TRANSACTIONS AS

WELL AS CERTAIN FIRM COMMITMENTS AND THE RELATED RECEIVABLES AND

PAYABLES, INCLUDING THIRD PARTY OR INTERCOMPANY TRANSACTIONS.

WHEN WE BEGIN HEDGING EXPOSURES DEPENDS ON THE NATURE OF THE

EXPOSURE AND MARKET CONDITIONS. GENERALLY, ALL ANTICIPATED AND

FIRMLY COMMITTED TRANSACTIONS THAT ARE HEDGED ARE TO BE

RECOGNIZED WITHIN TWELVE MONTHS, ALTHOUGH AT MAY 31, 2005

WE HAD FORWARD CONTRACTS HEDGING ANTICIPATED TRANSACTIONS THAT

WILL BE RECOGNIZED IN AS MANY AS 24 MONTHS. THE MAJORITY OF

THE CONTRACTS EXPIRING IN MORE THAN TWELVE MONTHS RELATE TO THE

ANTICIPATED PURCHASE OF INVENTORY BY OUR EUROPEAN AND JAPANESE

SUBSIDIARIES. WE USE FORWARD CONTRACTS TO HEDGE NON-FUNCTIONAL

CURRENCY DENOMINATED PAYMENTS UNDER INTERCOMPANY LOAN

AGREEMENTS. WHEN INTERCOMPANY LOANS ARE HEDGED, IT IS TYPICALLY

FOR THEIR EXPECTED DURATION. HEDGED TRANSACTIONS ARE PRINCIPALLY

DENOMINATED IN EUROS, JAPANESE YEN, CANADIAN DOLLARS, KOREAN

WON, AUSTRALIAN DOLLARS, AND MEXICAN PESOS.

OUR EARNINGS ARE ALSO EXPOSED TO MOVEMENTS IN SHORT AND

LONG-TERM MARKET INTEREST RATES. OUR OBJECTIVE IN MANAGING THIS

INTEREST RATE EXPOSURE IS TO LIMIT THE IMPACT OF INTEREST RATE

CHANGES ON EARNINGS AND CASH FLOWS, AND TO REDUCE OVERALL

BORROWING COSTS. TO ACHIEVE THESE OBJECTIVES, WE MAINTAIN A MIX

OF MEDIUM AND LONG-TERM FIXED RATE DEBT, COMMERCIAL PAPER, AND

BANK LOANS AND HAVE ENTERED INTO INTEREST RATE SWAPS.

MARKET RISK MEASUREMENT

WE MONITOR FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK, INTEREST RATE RISK AND RELATED

DERIVATIVES USING A VARIETY OF TECHNIQUES INCLUDING A REVIEW OF

MARKET VALUE, SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS, AND VALUE-AT-RISK (VAR). OUR

MARKET-SENSITIVE DERIVATIVE AND OTHER FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, AS

DEFINED BY THE SEC, ARE FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS,

FOREIGN CURRENCY OPTION CONTRACTS, INTEREST RATE SWAPS,

INTERCOMPANY LOANS DENOMINATED IN NON-FUNCTIONAL CURRENCIES,

FIXED INTEREST RATE U.S. DOLLAR DENOMINATED DEBT, AND FIXED

INTEREST RATE JAPANESE YEN DENOMINATED DEBT.

WE USE VAR TO MONITOR THE FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK OF OUR FOREIGN

CURRENCY FORWARD AND FOREIGN CURRENCY OPTION DERIVATIVE

INSTRUMENTS ONLY. THE VAR DETERMINES THE MAXIMUM POTENTIAL

ONE-DAY LOSS IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THESE FOREIGN EXCHANGE

RATE-SENSITIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS. THE VAR MODEL ESTIMATES

ASSUME NORMAL MARKET CONDITIONS AND A 95% CONFIDENCE LEVEL.

THERE ARE VARIOUS MODELING TECHNIQUES THAT CAN BE USED IN THE

VAR COMPUTATION. OUR COMPUTATIONS ARE BASED ON

INTERRELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN CURRENCIES AND INTEREST RATES (A

VARIANCE/ CO-VARIANCE TECHNIQUE). THESE

INTERRELATIONSHIPS ARE A FUNCTION OF FOREIGN EXCHANGE CURRENCY

MARKET CHANGES AND INTEREST RATE CHANGES OVER THE PRECEDING ONE

YEAR. THE VALUE OF FOREIGN CURRENCY OPTIONS DOES NOT CHANGE ON A

ONE-TO-ONE BASIS WITH CHANGES IN THE UNDERLYING CURRENCY RATE.

WE ADJUSTED THE POTENTIAL LOSS IN OPTION VALUE FOR THE ESTIMATED

SENSITIVITY (THE DELTA AND GAMMA) TO

CHANGES IN THE UNDERLYING CURRENCY RATE. THIS CALCULATION

REFLECTS THE IMPACT OF FOREIGN CURRENCY RATE FLUCTUATIONS ON THE

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS ONLY, AND DOES NOT INCLUDE THE IMPACT OF

SUCH RATE FLUCTUATIONS ON NON-FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY TRANSACTIONS

(SUCH AS ANTICIPATED TRANSACTIONS, FIRM COMMITMENTS, CASH

BALANCES, AND ACCOUNTS AND LOANS RECEIVABLE AND PAYABLE),

INCLUDING THOSE WHICH ARE HEDGED BY THESE INSTRUMENTS.

THE VAR MODEL IS A RISK ANALYSIS TOOL AND DOES NOT PURPORT TO

REPRESENT ACTUAL LOSSES IN FAIR VALUE THAT WE WILL INCUR, NOR

DOES IT CONSIDER THE POTENTIAL EFFECT OF FAVORABLE CHANGES IN

MARKET RATES. IT ALSO DOES NOT REPRESENT THE FULL EXTENT OF THE

POSSIBLE LOSS THAT MAY OCCUR. ACTUAL FUTURE GAINS AND LOSSES

WILL DIFFER FROM THOSE ESTIMATED BECAUSE OF CHANGES OR

DIFFERENCES IN MARKET RATES AND INTERRELATIONSHIPS, HEDGING

INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGE PERCENTAGES, TIMING AND OTHER FACTORS.

THE ESTIMATED MAXIMUM ONE-DAY LOSS IN FAIR VALUE ON OUR FOREIGN

CURRENCY SENSITIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, DERIVED USING THE VAR

MODEL, WAS $25.7 AND $24.9 MILLION AT MAY 31,

2005 AND MAY 31, 2004, RESPECTIVELY. THE INCREASE IN VAR AS

OF MAY 31, 2005 OCCURRED DUE TO A LARGER PORTFOLIO OF

FOREIGN CURRENCY DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS WHICH WAS LARGELY OFFSET

BY THE EFFECT OF LOWER CURRENCY VOLATILITY ON EXISTING TRADES ON

THE MAY 31, 2005 VAR COMPUTATION VERSUS THE MAY 31,

2004 VAR COMPUTATION. SUCH A HYPOTHETICAL LOSS IN FAIR VALUE OF

OUR DERIVATIVES WOULD BE OFFSET BY INCREASES IN THE VALUE OF THE

UNDERLYING TRANSACTIONS BEING HEDGED. THE AVERAGE MONTHLY CHANGE

IN THE FAIR VALUES OF FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD AND FOREIGN

CURRENCY OPTION DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS WAS $37.2 MILLION

AND $50.0 MILLION FOR FISCAL 2005 AND FISCAL 2004,

RESPECTIVELY.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

INTERCOMPANY LOANS AND RELATED INTEREST AMOUNTS ELIMINATE IN

CONSOLIDATION. INTERCOMPANY LOANS ARE GENERALLY HEDGED AGAINST

FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK THROUGH THE USE OF FORWARD CONTRACTS WITH

THIRD PARTIES, AS DISCUSSED ABOVE.

THE FIXED INTEREST RATE JAPANESE YEN DENOMINATED DEBTS WERE

ISSUED BY AND ARE ACCOUNTED FOR BY TWO OF OUR JAPANESE

SUBSIDIARIES. ACCORDINGLY, THE MONTHLY REMEASUREMENT OF THESE

INSTRUMENTS DUE TO CHANGES IN FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES IS

RECOGNIZED IN ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME UPON THE

CONSOLIDATION OF THESE SUBSIDIARIES.

THERE WERE NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN DEBT MARKET RISKS DURING

FISCAL 2005. WE DID NOT ISSUE ANY LONG-TERM FIXED-RATE CORPORATE

BONDS DURING FISCAL 2005; HOWEVER, DURING FISCAL 2002, 2003 AND

FISCAL 2004 WE ISSUED A TOTAL OF $490 MILLION IN LONG-TERM

FIXED-RATE CORPORATE BONDS THAT MATURE BETWEEN AUGUST 2006 AND

OCTOBER 2015. FIXED INTEREST RATES ON THESE BONDS RANGE FROM

4.7% TO 5.66%. FOR EACH OF THE BONDS ISSUED IN FISCAL 2002, 2003

AND FISCAL 2004, WE HAVE ENTERED INTO INTEREST RATE SWAP

AGREEMENTS WHEREBY WE RECEIVE FIXED INTEREST PAYMENTS AT THE

SAME RATE AS THE BONDS AND PAY VARIABLE INTEREST PAYMENTS BASED

ON THE THREE-MONTH OR SIX-MONTH LIBOR PLUS A SPREAD. AS A RESULT

OF THE INTEREST RATE SWAP AGREEMENTS THE AVERAGE EFFECTIVE

INTEREST RATE PAYABLE ON THESE BONDS WAS 4.17% AT MAY 31,

2005 AND 2.4% AT MAY 31, 2004. EACH SWAP HAS THE SAME

NOTIONAL AMOUNT AND MATURITY DATE AS THE CORRESPONDING BOND,

EXCEPT FOR ONE SWAP FOR A $50 MILLION BOND ISSUED IN FISCAL

2004. THE $50 MILLION BOND ISSUED IN FISCAL 2004 MATURES IN

OCTOBER 2013 WHEREAS THE ASSOCIATED INTEREST RATE SWAP EXPIRES

IN OCTOBER 2006. THESE INTEREST RATE SWAPS ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AS

FAIR VALUE HEDGES, SO CHANGES IN THE RECORDED FAIR VALUES OF THE

SWAPS ARE OFFSET BY CHANGES IN THE RECORDED FAIR VALUE OF THE

RELATED DEBT, EXCEPT FOR THE $50 MILLION SWAP EXPIRING IN

OCTOBER 2006 WHICH IS NOT ACCOUNTED FOR AS A HEDGE. ACCORDINGLY,

CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THIS SWAP ARE RECORDED TO NET

INCOME EACH PERIOD. THE RECORDED FAIR VALUE OF THE INTEREST RATE

SWAPS ACCOUNTED FOR AS FAIR VALUE HEDGES WAS A NET

$9.0 MILLION GAIN AT MAY 31, 2005 AND A

$3.3 MILLION GAIN AT MAY 31, 2004. THE RECORDED FAIR

VALUE OF THE $50 MILLION INTEREST RATE SWAP EXPIRING

OCTOBER 2006 WAS NOT MATERIAL FOR THE YEARS ENDED MAY 31,

2005 AND 2004.

IN FISCAL 2003 WE ALSO ENTERED INTO AN INTEREST RATE SWAP

AGREEMENT RELATED TO A JAPANESE YEN DENOMINATED INTERCOMPANY

LOAN WITH ONE OF OUR JAPANESE SUBSIDIARIES. THE JAPANESE

SUBSIDIARY PAYS VARIABLE INTEREST ON THE INTERCOMPANY LOAN BASED

ON 3-MONTH LIBOR PLUS A SPREAD. UNDER THE INTEREST RATE SWAP

AGREEMENT, THE SUBSIDIARY PAYS FIXED INTEREST PAYMENTS AT 0.8%

AND RECEIVES VARIABLE INTEREST PAYMENTS BASED ON 3-MONTH LIBOR

PLUS A SPREAD BASED ON A NOTIONAL AMOUNT OF 8 BILLION

JAPANESE YEN. THIS INTEREST RATE SWAP IS NOT ACCOUNTED FOR AS A

HEDGE, ACCORDINGLY CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE SWAP ARE

RECORDED TO NET INCOME EACH PERIOD. THE RECORDED FAIR VALUE OF

THE SWAP WAS NOT MATERIAL FOR THE YEARS ENDED MAY 31, 2005,

2004 AND 2003.

REPRESENTATIONS CONTAINED IN THIS REPORT. THE FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS HAVE BEEN PREPARED IN CONFORMITY WITH THE GENERALLY

ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES WE CONSIDERED APPROPRIATE IN THE

CIRCUMSTANCES AND INCLUDE SOME AMOUNTS BASED ON OUR BEST

ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS. OTHER FINANCIAL INFORMATION IN THIS

OUR ACCOUNTING SYSTEMS INCLUDE CONTROLS DESIGNED TO REASONABLY

ASSURE THAT ASSETS ARE SAFEGUARDED FROM UNAUTHORIZED USE OR

DISPOSITION AND WHICH PROVIDE FOR THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS IN CONFORMITY WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING

PRINCIPLES. THESE SYSTEMS ARE SUPPLEMENTED BY THE SELECTION AND

MANAGEMENTS REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL

REPORTING

MANAGEMENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ESTABLISHING AND MAINTAINING

ADEQUATE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, AS SUCH TERM

IS DEFINED IN EXCHANGE ACT RULE 13A-15(F). UNDER THE

SUPERVISION AND WITH THE PARTICIPATION OF OUR CHIEF EXECUTIVE

OFFICER AND CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER, OUR MANAGEMENT CONDUCTED AN

EVALUATION OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR INTERNAL CONTROL OVER

FINANCIAL REPORTING BASED UPON THE FRAMEWORK IN

INTERNAL

CONTROL  INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK

ISSUED BY THE

COMMITTEE OF SPONSORING ORGANIZATIONS OF THE TREADWAY

COMMISSION. BASED ON THAT EVALUATION, OUR MANAGEMENT CONCLUDED

THAT OUR INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING IS EFFECTIVE

AS OF MAY 31, 2005.

INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING CANNOT PROVIDE

ABSOLUTE ASSURANCE OF ACHIEVING FINANCIAL REPORTING OBJECTIVES

BECAUSE OF ITS INHERENT LIMITATIONS. INTERNAL CONTROL OVER

FINANCIAL REPORTING IS A PROCESS THAT INVOLVES HUMAN DILIGENCE

AND COMPLIANCE AND IS SUBJECT TO LAPSES IN JUDGMENT AND

BREAKDOWNS RESULTING FROM HUMAN FAILURES. INTERNAL CONTROL OVER

FINANCIAL REPORTING ALSO CAN BE CIRCUMVENTED BY COLLUSION OR

IMPROPER MANAGEMENT OVERRIDE. BECAUSE OF SUCH LIMITATIONS, THERE

IS A RISK THAT MATERIAL MISSTATEMENTS MAY NOT BE PREVENTED OR

DETECTED ON A TIMELY BASIS BY INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL

REPORTING. HOWEVER, THESE INHERENT LIMITATIONS ARE KNOWN

FEATURES OF THE FINANCIAL REPORTING PROCESS. THEREFORE, IT IS

POSSIBLE TO DESIGN INTO THE PROCESS SAFEGUARDS TO REDUCE, THOUGH

NOT ELIMINATE, THIS RISK.

PRICEWATERHOUSECOOPERS LLP, AN INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC

ACCOUNTING FIRM, HAS AUDITED (1) THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS, (2) MANAGEMENTS ASSESSMENT OF THE

EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

AS OF MAY 31, 2005 AND (3) THE EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR

INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF MAY 31,

2005, AS STATED IN THEIR REPORT HEREIN.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

TO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND SHAREHOLDERS OF NIKE, INC..

WE HAVE COMPLETED AN INTEGRATED AUDIT OF NIKE, INC.S 2005

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND OF ITS INTERNAL CONTROL

OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF MAY 31, 2005 AND AUDITS OF

ITS 2004 AND 2003 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN

ACCORDANCE WITH THE STANDARDS OF THE PUBLIC COMPANY ACCOUNTING

OVERSIGHT BOARD (UNITED STATES). OUR OPINIONS, BASED ON OUR

AUDITS, ARE PRESENTED BELOW.

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND FINANCIAL STATEMENT

SCHEDULE

IN OUR OPINION, THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS LISTED IN

THE INDEX APPEARING UNDER ITEM 15(A)(1) PRESENT FAIRLY, IN

ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS, THE FINANCIAL POSITION OF NIKE, INC. AND

ITS SUBSIDIARIES AT MAY 31, 2005 AND 2004, AND THE RESULTS

OF THEIR OPERATIONS AND THEIR CASH FLOWS FOR EACH OF THE THREE

YEARS IN THE PERIOD ENDED MAY 31, 2005 IN CONFORMITY WITH

ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF

AMERICA. IN ADDITION, IN OUR OPINION, THE FINANCIAL STATEMENT

SCHEDULE LISTED IN THE INDEX APPEARING UNDER ITEM 15(A)(2)

PRESENTS FAIRLY, IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS, THE INFORMATION SET

FORTH THEREIN WHEN READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE RELATED

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

AND FINANCIAL STATEMENT SCHEDULE ARE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE

COMPANYS MANAGEMENT. OUR RESPONSIBILITY IS TO EXPRESS AN

OPINION ON THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND FINANCIAL STATEMENT

SCHEDULE BASED ON OUR AUDITS. WE CONDUCTED OUR AUDITS OF THESE

STATEMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE STANDARDS OF THE PUBLIC

COMPANY ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BOARD (UNITED STATES). THOSE

STANDARDS REQUIRE THAT WE PLAN AND PERFORM THE AUDIT TO OBTAIN

REASONABLE ASSURANCE ABOUT WHETHER THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE

FREE OF MATERIAL MISSTATEMENT. AN AUDIT OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

INCLUDES EXAMINING, ON A TEST BASIS, EVIDENCE SUPPORTING THE

AMOUNTS AND DISCLOSURES IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, ASSESSING

THE ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES USED AND SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES MADE BY

MANAGEMENT, AND EVALUATING THE OVERALL FINANCIAL STATEMENT

PRESENTATION. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR AUDITS PROVIDE A REASONABLE

BASIS FOR OUR OPINION.

AS DISCUSSED IN NOTE 4 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS, EFFECTIVE JUNE 1, 2002, THE COMPANY CHANGED ITS

METHOD OF ACCOUNTING FOR GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS IN

ACCORDANCE WITH THE STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

NO. 142, GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS.

INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

ALSO, IN OUR OPINION, MANAGEMENTS ASSESSMENT, INCLUDED IN

MANAGEMENTS REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL

REPORTING APPEARING UNDER ITEM 8, THAT THE COMPANY

MAINTAINED EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

AS OF MAY 31, 2005 BASED ON CRITERIA ESTABLISHED IN

INTERNAL CONTROL  INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK

ISSUED

BY THE COMMITTEE OF SPONSORING ORGANIZATIONS OF THE TREADWAY

COMMISSION (COSO), IS FAIRLY STATED, IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS,

BASED ON THOSE CRITERIA. FURTHERMORE, IN OUR OPINION, THE

COMPANY MAINTAINED, IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS, EFFECTIVE INTERNAL

CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF MAY 31, 2005, BASED

ON CRITERIA ESTABLISHED IN

INTERNAL CONTROL 

INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK

ISSUED BY THE COSO. THE COMPANYS

MANAGEMENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR MAINTAINING EFFECTIVE INTERNAL

CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AND FOR ITS ASSESSMENT OF THE

EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING. OUR

RESPONSIBILITY IS TO EXPRESS OPINIONS ON MANAGEMENTS

ASSESSMENT AND ON THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE COMPANYS

INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING BASED ON OUR AUDIT. WE

CONDUCTED OUR AUDIT OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE STANDARDS OF THE PUBLIC COMPANY

ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BOARD (UNITED STATES). THOSE STANDARDS

REQUIRE THAT WE PLAN AND PERFORM THE AUDIT TO OBTAIN REASONABLE

ASSURANCE ABOUT WHETHER EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER

FINANCIAL REPORTING WAS MAINTAINED IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS. AN

AUDIT OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING INCLUDES

OBTAINING AN UNDERSTANDING OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL

REPORTING, EVALUATING MANAGEMENTS ASSESSMENT, TESTING AND

EVALUATING THE DESIGN AND OPERATING EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL

CONTROL, AND PERFORMING SUCH OTHER PROCEDURES AS WE CONSIDER

NECESSARY IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR AUDIT

PROVIDES A REASONABLE BASIS FOR OUR OPINIONS.

A COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING IS A

PROCESS DESIGNED TO PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING THE

RELIABILITY OF FINANCIAL REPORTING AND THE PREPARATION OF

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR

35

TABLE OF CONTENTS

EXTERNAL PURPOSES IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED

ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES. A COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER

FINANCIAL REPORTING INCLUDES THOSE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES THAT

(I) PERTAIN TO THE MAINTENANCE OF RECORDS THAT, IN

REASONABLE DETAIL, ACCURATELY AND FAIRLY REFLECT THE

TRANSACTIONS AND DISPOSITIONS OF THE ASSETS OF THE COMPANY;

(II) PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE THAT TRANSACTIONS ARE

RECORDED AS NECESSARY TO PERMIT PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING

PRINCIPLES, AND THAT RECEIPTS AND EXPENDITURES OF THE COMPANY

ARE BEING MADE ONLY IN ACCORDANCE WITH AUTHORIZATIONS OF

MANAGEMENT AND DIRECTORS OF THE COMPANY; AND (III) PROVIDE

REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING PREVENTION OR TIMELY DETECTION OF

UNAUTHORIZED ACQUISITION, USE, OR DISPOSITION OF THE

COMPANYS ASSETS THAT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

BECAUSE OF ITS INHERENT LIMITATIONS, INTERNAL CONTROL OVER

FINANCIAL REPORTING MAY NOT PREVENT OR DETECT MISSTATEMENTS.

ALSO, PROJECTIONS OF ANY EVALUATION OF EFFECTIVENESS TO FUTURE

PERIODS ARE SUBJECT TO THE RISK THAT CONTROLS MAY BECOME

INADEQUATE BECAUSE OF CHANGES IN CONDITIONS, OR THAT THE DEGREE

OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE POLICIES OR PROCEDURES MAY DETERIORATE.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 1 

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

BASIS OF CONSOLIDATION

THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDE THE ACCOUNTS OF

NIKE, INC. AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES (THE COMPANY). ALL

SIGNIFICANT INTERCOMPANY TRANSACTIONS AND BALANCES HAVE BEEN

ELIMINATED.

RECOGNITION OF REVENUES

WHOLESALE REVENUES ARE RECOGNIZED WHEN THE RISKS AND REWARDS OF

OWNERSHIP HAVE PASSED TO THE CUSTOMER, BASED ON THE TERMS OF

SALE. THIS OCCURS UPON SHIPMENT OR UPON RECEIPT BY THE CUSTOMER

DEPENDING ON THE COUNTRY OF THE SALE AND THE AGREEMENT WITH THE

CUSTOMER. RETAIL STORE REVENUES ARE RECORDED AT THE TIME OF

SALE. PROVISIONS FOR SALES DISCOUNTS, RETURNS AND MISCELLANEOUS

CLAIMS FROM CUSTOMERS ARE MADE AT THE TIME OF SALE.

SHIPPING AND HANDLING COSTS

SHIPPING AND HANDLING COSTS ARE EXPENSED AS INCURRED AND

INCLUDED IN COST OF SALES.

ADVERTISING AND PROMOTION

ADVERTISING PRODUCTION COSTS ARE EXPENSED THE FIRST TIME THE

ADVERTISEMENT IS RUN. MEDIA (TV AND PRINT) PLACEMENT COSTS

ARE EXPENSED IN THE MONTH THE ADVERTISING APPEARS. A SIGNIFICANT

AMOUNT OF THE COMPANYS PROMOTIONAL EXPENSES RESULT FROM

PAYMENTS UNDER ENDORSEMENT CONTRACTS. ACCOUNTING FOR ENDORSEMENT

PAYMENTS IS BASED UPON SPECIFIC CONTRACT PROVISIONS. GENERALLY,

ENDORSEMENT PAYMENTS ARE EXPENSED UNIFORMLY OVER THE TERM OF THE

CONTRACT AFTER GIVING RECOGNITION TO PERIODIC PERFORMANCE

COMPLIANCE PROVISIONS OF THE CONTRACTS. PREPAYMENTS MADE UNDER

CONTRACTS ARE INCLUDED IN PREPAID EXPENSES AND OTHER CURRENT

ASSETS OR OTHER ASSETS DEPENDING ON THE LENGTH OF THE CONTRACT.

THROUGH COOPERATIVE ADVERTISING PROGRAMS, THE COMPANY REIMBURSES

ITS RETAIL CUSTOMERS FOR CERTAIN OF THEIR COSTS OF ADVERTISING

THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS. THE COMPANY RECORDS THESE COSTS IN

SELLING AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE AT THE POINT IN TIME WHEN IT

IS OBLIGATED TO ITS CUSTOMERS FOR THE COSTS, WHICH IS WHEN THE

RELATED REVENUES ARE RECOGNIZED. THIS OBLIGATION MAY ARISE PRIOR

TO THE RELATED ADVERTISEMENT BEING RUN. TOTAL ADVERTISING AND

PROMOTION EXPENSES WERE $1,600.7 MILLION,

$1,377.9 MILLION, AND $1,166.8 MILLION FOR THE YEARS

ENDED MAY 31, 2005, 2004 AND 2003, RESPECTIVELY. PREPAID

ADVERTISING AND PROMOTION EXPENSES RECORDED AS APPROPRIATE IN

PREPAID EXPENSES AND OTHER CURRENT ASSETS AND OTHER ASSETS

TOTALED $126.1 MILLION AND $154.6 MILLION AT

MAY 31, 2005 AND 2004, RESPECTIVELY.

CASH AND EQUIVALENTS

CASH AND EQUIVALENTS REPRESENT CASH AND SHORT-TERM, HIGHLY

LIQUID INVESTMENTS WITH ORIGINAL MATURITIES OF THREE MONTHS OR

LESS AT DATE OF PURCHASE. THE CARRYING AMOUNTS REFLECTED IN THE

CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET FOR CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS

APPROXIMATE FAIR VALUE DUE TO THE SHORT MATURITIES.

SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS

SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS CONSIST PRIMARILY OF U.S. TREASURY

DEBT SECURITIES WITH MATURITIES OF SIX MONTHS OR LESS AT THE

DATE OF PURCHASE. DEBT SECURITIES WHICH THE COMPANY HAS THE

ABILITY AND POSITIVE INTENT TO HOLD TO MATURITY ARE CARRIED AT

AMORTIZED COST. AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE DEBT SECURITIES ARE RECORDED

AT FAIR VALUE WITH ANY NET UNREALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES REPORTED,

NET OF TAX, IN OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME. REALIZED GAINS OR

LOSSES ARE DETERMINED BASED ON THE SPECIFIC IDENTIFICATION

METHOD. THE COMPANY HOLDS NO INVESTMENTS CONSIDERED TO BE

TRADING SECURITIES. AMORTIZED COST OF BOTH AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE

AND HELD-TO-MATURITY DEBT SECURITIES APPROXIMATES FAIR MARKET

VALUE DUE TO THEIR SHORT MATURITIES. SUBSTANTIALLY ALL

INVESTMENTS HELD AT MAY 31, 2005 HAVE REMAINING MATURITIES

OF 120 DAYS OR LESS. INCLUDED IN INTEREST EXPENSE, NET FOR

THE YEARS ENDED MAY 31, 2005,

TO SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS AND CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS.

INVENTORY VALUATION

INVENTORIES ARE STATED AT THE LOWER OF COST OR MARKET.

INVENTORIES ARE VALUED ON A FIRST-IN, FIRST-OUT (FIFO) OR

MOVING-AVERAGE COST BASIS.

PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT AND DEPRECIATION

PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT ARE RECORDED AT COST. DEPRECIATION

FOR FINANCIAL REPORTING PURPOSES IS DETERMINED ON A

STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS FOR BUILDINGS AND LEASEHOLD IMPROVEMENTS

OVER 2 TO 40 YEARS AND PRINCIPALLY ON A DOUBLE DECLINING

BALANCE BASIS FOR MACHINERY AND EQUIPMENT OVER 2 TO

15 YEARS. COMPUTER SOFTWARE (INCLUDING, IN SOME CASES, THE

COST OF INTERNAL LABOR) IS DEPRECIATED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS

OVER 3 TO 10 YEARS.

IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS

IN ACCORDANCE WITH STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

(SFAS) NO. 144 ACCOUNTING FOR THE IMPAIRMENT OR

DISPOSAL OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS (FAS 144), THE COMPANY

ESTIMATES THE FUTURE UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS TO BE DERIVED FROM

AN ASSET TO ASSESS WHETHER OR NOT A POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT EXISTS

WHEN EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THE CARRYING VALUE OF A

LONG-LIVED ASSET MAY BE IMPAIRED. IF THE CARRYING VALUE EXCEEDS

THE COMPANYS ESTIMATE OF FUTURE UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS,

THE COMPANY THEN CALCULATES THE IMPAIRMENT AS THE EXCESS OF THE

CARRYING VALUE OF THE ASSET OVER THE COMPANYS ESTIMATE OF

ITS FAIR MARKET VALUE.

IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND GOODWILL

IN ACCORDANCE WITH SFAS NO. 142 GOODWILL AND

OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS (FAS 142), GOODWILL AND

INTANGIBLE ASSETS WITH INDEFINITE LIVES ARE NOT AMORTIZED BUT

INSTEAD ARE MEASURED FOR IMPAIRMENT AT LEAST ANNUALLY IN THE

FOURTH QUARTER, OR WHEN EVENTS INDICATE THAT AN IMPAIRMENT

EXISTS. AS REQUIRED BY FAS 142, IN THE COMPANYS

IMPAIRMENT TEST OF GOODWILL, THE COMPANY COMPARES THE FAIR VALUE

OF THE APPLICABLE REPORTING UNIT TO ITS CARRYING VALUE. IF THE

CARRYING VALUE OF THE REPORTING UNIT EXCEEDS THE ESTIMATE OF

FAIR VALUE, THE COMPANY CALCULATES THE IMPAIRMENT AS THE EXCESS

OF THE CARRYING VALUE OF GOODWILL OVER ITS IMPLIED FAIR VALUE.

IN THE IMPAIRMENT TESTS FOR INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS,

THE COMPANY COMPARES THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF THE

INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS TO THE CARRYING VALUE. IF THE

CARRYING VALUE EXCEEDS THE ESTIMATE OF FAIR VALUE, THE COMPANY

CALCULATES IMPAIRMENT AS THE EXCESS OF THE CARRYING VALUE OVER

THE ESTIMATE OF FAIR VALUE. SEE NOTE 4 FOR DISCUSSION OF

THE COMPANYS ADOPTION OF FAS 142 IN THE YEAR ENDED

MAY 31, 2003.

INTANGIBLE ASSETS THAT ARE DETERMINED TO HAVE DEFINITE LIVES ARE

AMORTIZED OVER THEIR USEFUL LIVES AND ARE MEASURED FOR

IMPAIRMENT ONLY WHEN EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THE

CARRYING VALUE MAY BE IMPAIRED IN ACCORDANCE WITH FAS 144

DISCUSSED ABOVE.

FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION AND FOREIGN CURRENCY

ADJUSTMENTS RESULTING FROM TRANSLATING FOREIGN FUNCTIONAL

CURRENCY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INTO U.S. DOLLARS ARE

INCLUDED IN THE FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENT, A

ACCOUNTING FOR DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES

THE COMPANY USES DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS TO LIMIT

EXPOSURE TO CHANGES IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES AND

INTEREST RATES. THE COMPANY ACCOUNTS FOR DERIVATIVES PURSUANT TO

SFAS NO. 133, ACCOUNTING FOR DERIVATIVE

INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES, AS AMENDED AND

INTERPRETED (FAS 133). FAS 133 ESTABLISHES ACCOUNTING

AND REPORTING STANDARDS FOR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND REQUIRES

THAT ALL DERIVATIVES BE RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE ON THE BALANCE

SHEET. CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL

INSTRUMENTS ARE EITHER RECOGNIZED IN OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME

(A COMPONENT OF SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY) OR NET INCOME

DEPENDING ON WHETHER THE DERIVATIVE IS BEING USED TO HEDGE

CHANGES IN CASH FLOWS OR FAIR VALUE.

SEE NOTE 16 FOR MORE INFORMATION ON THE COMPANYS RISK

MANAGEMENT PROGRAM AND DERIVATIVES.

STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION

THE COMPANY USES THE INTRINSIC VALUE METHOD TO ACCOUNT FOR

STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION IN ACCORDANCE WITH ACCOUNTING

PRINCIPLES BOARD (APB) OPINION NO. 25,

ACCOUNTING FOR STOCK ISSUED TO EMPLOYEES AS

PERMITTED BY SFAS NO. 123 ACCOUNTING FOR

STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION (FAS 123). THE

COMPANYS POLICY IS TO GRANT STOCK OPTIONS WITH AN EXERCISE

PRICE EQUAL TO THE MARKET VALUE AT THE DATE OF GRANT, AND

ACCORDINGLY, NO COMPENSATION EXPENSE IS RECOGNIZED.

AS REQUIRED BY FAS 123 AND AMENDED BY

SFAS NO. 148 ACCOUNTING FOR STOCK-BASED

COMPENSATION  TRANSITION AND DISCLOSURE

(FAS 148), THE COMPANY HAS COMPUTED, FOR PRO FORMA

DISCLOSURE PURPOSES, THE FAIR VALUE OF OPTIONS GRANTED AND

EMPLOYEES PURCHASE RIGHTS UNDER THE EMPLOYEE STOCK

PURCHASE PLAN (ESPP) DURING THE YEARS ENDED MAY 31,

2005, 2004 AND 2003 USING THE BLACK-SCHOLES OPTION PRICING

MODEL. THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE ASSUMPTIONS USED FOR THE MAJORITY OF

STOCK OPTION GRANTS FOR EACH OF THESE YEARS WERE A DIVIDEND

YIELD OF 1%, EXPECTED VOLATILITY OF THE MARKET PRICE OF THE

COMPANYS COMMON STOCK OF 42%, 44%, AND 38% FOR THE YEARS

ENDED MAY 31, 2005, 2004 AND 2003, RESPECTIVELY; A

WEIGHTED-AVERAGE EXPECTED LIFE OF THE OPTIONS OF APPROXIMATELY

FIVE YEARS; AND INTEREST RATES OF 3.7%, 2.9%, AND 3.8% FOR THE

YEARS ENDED MAY 31, 2005, 2004 AND 2003, RESPECTIVELY.

OPTIONS WERE ASSUMED TO BE EXERCISED OVER THE FIVE YEAR EXPECTED

LIFE FOR PURPOSES OF THIS VALUATION. ADJUSTMENTS FOR FORFEITURES

ARE MADE AS THEY OCCUR. FOR THE YEARS ENDED MAY 31, 2005,

2004 AND 2003, THE TOTAL VALUE OF THE OPTIONS GRANTED, FOR WHICH

NO PREVIOUS EXPENSE HAS BEEN RECOGNIZED, WAS COMPUTED AS

APPROXIMATELY $150.2 MILLION, $102.3 MILLION, AND

$89.8 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, WHICH WOULD BE AMORTIZED ON A

STRAIGHT LINE BASIS OVER THE VESTING PERIOD OF THE OPTIONS. THE

WEIGHTED AVERAGE FAIR VALUE PER SHARE OF THE OPTIONS GRANTED IN

THE YEARS ENDED MAY 31, 2005, 2004 AND 2003 ARE $27.90,

$20.36, AND $17.45, RESPECTIVELY.

ON DECEMBER 16, 2004, THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

BOARD (FASB) FINALIZED SFAS NO. 123R

SHARE-BASED PAYMENT (FAS 123R) WHICH, AFTER THE

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (SEC) AMENDED THE

COMPLIANCE DATES ON APRIL 15, 2005, WILL BE EFFECTIVE FOR

THE COMPANYS FISCAL YEAR BEGINNING JUNE 1, 2006. THE

NEW STANDARD WILL REQUIRE THE COMPANY TO RECORD COMPENSATION

EXPENSE FOR STOCK OPTIONS USING A FAIR VALUE METHOD. ON

MARCH 29, 2005, THE SEC ISSUED STAFF ACCOUNTING

BULLETIN NO. 107 (SAB 107), WHICH PROVIDES THE

STAFFS VIEWS REGARDING INTERACTIONS BETWEEN FAS 123R

AND CERTAIN SEC RULES AND REGULATIONS AND PROVIDES

INTERPRETATIONS OF THE VALUATION OF SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS FOR

PUBLIC COMPANIES.

THE COMPANY IS CURRENTLY EVALUATING FAS 123R AND

SAB 107 TO DETERMINE THE FAIR VALUE METHOD TO MEASURE

COMPENSATION EXPENSE, THE APPROPRIATE ASSUMPTIONS TO INCLUDE IN

THE FAIR VALUE MODEL AND THE TRANSITION METHOD TO USE UPON

ADOPTION. THE IMPACT OF THE ADOPTION OF FAS 123R IS NOT

KNOWN AT THIS TIME DUE TO THESE FACTORS AS WELL AS THE UNKNOWN

LEVEL OF SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS GRANTED IN FUTURE YEARS. THE

EFFECT ON THE COMPANYS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OF EXPENSING

STOCK OPTIONS USING THE BLACK-SCHOLES MODEL IS PRESENTED IN THE

TABLE ABOVE.

UNDER CERTAIN CONDITIONS, STOCK OPTIONS GRANTED BY THE COMPANY

ARE ELIGIBLE FOR ACCELERATED VESTING UPON THE RETIREMENT OF THE

EMPLOYEE. THE FASB CLARIFIED IN FAS 123R THAT THE FAIR

VALUE OF SUCH STOCK OPTIONS SHOULD BE EXPENSED BASED ON AN

ACCELERATED VESTING SCHEDULE OR IMMEDIATELY, RATHER THAN RATABLY

OVER THE VESTING PERIOD STATED IN THE GRANT. THE COMPANYS

PRO FORMA DISCLOSURE ABOVE CURRENTLY REFLECTS THE EXPENSE OF

SUCH OPTIONS RATABLY OVER THE STATED VESTING PERIOD, EXPENSING

ALL UNVESTED SHARES UPON ACTUAL RETIREMENT. THE SEC HAS RECENTLY

CLARIFIED THAT COMPANIES SHOULD CONTINUE TO FOLLOW THE VESTING

METHOD THEY HAVE BEEN USING UNTIL ADOPTION OF FAS 123R,

THEN APPLY THE ACCELERATED VESTING SCHEDULE TO ALL SUBSEQUENT

GRANTS TO THOSE EMPLOYEES ELIGIBLE FOR ACCELERATED VESTING UPON

RETIREMENT. HAD THE COMPANY BEEN ACCOUNTING FOR SUCH STOCK

OPTIONS USING THE ACCELERATED VESTING SCHEDULE FOR THOSE

EMPLOYEES ELIGIBLE FOR ACCELERATED VESTING UPON RETIREMENT, THE

COMPANY WOULD HAVE RECOGNIZED ADDITIONAL STOCK-BASED

COMPENSATION EXPENSE IN THE ABOVE PRO FORMA OF $0.05 PER

DILUTED SHARE FOR THE YEARS ENDED MAY 31, 2005, 2004 AND

2003.

INCOME TAXES

THE COMPANY ACCOUNTS FOR INCOME TAXES USING THE ASSET AND

LIABILITY METHOD. THIS APPROACH REQUIRES THE RECOGNITION OF

DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES FOR THE EXPECTED FUTURE TAX

CONSEQUENCES OF TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE CARRYING

AMOUNTS AND THE TAX BASES OF OTHER ASSETS AND LIABILITIES.

UNITED STATES INCOME TAXES ARE PROVIDED CURRENTLY ON FINANCIAL

STATEMENT EARNINGS OF NON-U.S. SUBSIDIARIES THAT ARE

EXPECTED TO BE REPATRIATED. THE COMPANY DETERMINES ANNUALLY THE

AMOUNT OF UNDISTRIBUTED NON-U.S. EARNINGS TO INVEST

INDEFINITELY IN ITS NON-U.S. OPERATIONS. SEE NOTE 8

FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION.

EARNINGS PER SHARE

BASIC EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE IS CALCULATED BY DIVIDING NET

INCOME BY THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE NUMBER OF COMMON SHARES

OUTSTANDING DURING THE YEAR. DILUTED EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE

IS CALCULATED BY ADJUSTING WEIGHTED AVERAGE OUTSTANDING SHARES,

ASSUMING CONVERSION OF ALL POTENTIALLY DILUTIVE STOCK OPTIONS

AND AWARDS. SEE NOTE 11 FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION.

MANAGEMENT ESTIMATES

THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN CONFORMITY WITH

GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO

MAKE ESTIMATES, INCLUDING ESTIMATES RELATING TO ASSUMPTIONS THAT

AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AND

DISCLOSURE OF CONTINGENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AT THE DATE OF

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF REVENUES AND

EXPENSES DURING THE REPORTING PERIOD. ACTUAL RESULTS COULD

DIFFER FROM THESE ESTIMATES.

RECLASSIFICATIONS

CERTAIN PRIOR YEAR AMOUNTS HAVE BEEN RECLASSIFIED TO CONFORM TO

FISCAL YEAR 2005 PRESENTATION. THESE CHANGES HAD NO IMPACT ON

PREVIOUSLY REPORTED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR SHAREHOLDERS

EQUITY.

RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

IN NOVEMBER 2004, THE FASB ISSUED SFAS NO. 151,

INVENTORY COSTS, AN AMENDMENT OF ARB NO. 43,

CHAPTER 4 (FAS 151). FAS 151 CLARIFIES THAT

ABNORMAL INVENTORY COSTS SUCH AS COSTS OF IDLE FACILITIES,

EXCESS FREIGHT AND HANDLING COSTS, AND WASTED MATERIALS

(SPOILAGE) ARE REQUIRED TO BE RECOGNIZED AS CURRENT PERIOD

CHARGES. THE PROVISIONS OF FAS 151 ARE EFFECTIVE FOR THE

FISCAL YEAR BEGINNING JUNE 1, 2006. THE COMPANY IS

CURRENTLY EVALUATING THE PROVISIONS OF FAS 151 AND DOES NOT

EXPECT THAT THE ADOPTION WILL HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE

COMPANYS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL POSITION OR RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS.

IN DECEMBER 2004, THE FASB ISSUED FAS 123R. IN MARCH 2005,

THE SEC ISSUED SAB 107 REGARDING THE SEC STAFFS

INTERPRETATION OF FAS 123R. SEE THE STOCK-BASED

COMPENSATION SECTION WITHIN NOTE 1 ABOVE FOR FURTHER

DISCUSSION.

ADOPTION OF FAS 142

THE COMPANY ADOPTED FAS 142 EFFECTIVE JUNE 1, 2002. IN

ACCORDANCE WITH FAS 142, GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS

WITH INDEFINITE LIVES ARE NOT AMORTIZED BUT INSTEAD ARE MEASURED

FOR IMPAIRMENT AT LEAST ANNUALLY IN THE FOURTH QUARTER, OR WHEN

EVENTS INDICATE THAT AN IMPAIRMENT EXISTS. INTANGIBLE ASSETS

THAT ARE DETERMINED TO HAVE DEFINITE LIVES ARE AMORTIZED OVER

THEIR USEFUL LIVES.

AS REQUIRED BY FAS 142, THE COMPANY PERFORMED IMPAIRMENT

TESTS ON GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS WITH INDEFINITE

LIVES, WHICH CONSISTED ONLY OF CERTAIN TRADEMARKS, AS OF

JUNE 1, 2002. AS A RESULT OF THE IMPAIRMENT TESTS, THE

COMPANY RECORDED A $266.1 MILLION CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF

ACCOUNTING CHANGE FOR THE YEAR ENDED MAY 31, 2003. UNDER

FAS 142, GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT EXISTS IF THE NET BOOK VALUE

OF A REPORTING UNIT EXCEEDS ITS ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE. THE

COMPANY ESTIMATED THE FAIR VALUE OF ITS REPORTING UNITS BY USING

A COMBINATION OF DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW ANALYSES AND COMPARISONS

WITH THE MARKET VALUES OF SIMILAR PUBLICLY-TRADED COMPANIES.

INCLUDED IN THE COMPANYS $266.1 MILLION IMPAIRMENT

CHARGE WAS A $178.5 MILLION CHARGE RELATED TO THE

IMPAIRMENT OF THE GOODWILL ASSOCIATED WITH THE BAUER NIKE HOCKEY

(BAUER) AND COLE HAAN REPORTING UNITS. THESE

REPORTING UNITS ARE REFLECTED IN THE COMPANYS OTHER

OPERATING SEGMENT. SINCE THE COMPANYS PURCHASE OF BAUER IN

1995, THE HOCKEY EQUIPMENT AND APPAREL MARKETS HAVE NOT GROWN AS

FAST AS EXPECTED AND

46

TABLE OF CONTENTS

NIKE, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

(CONTINUED)

THE IN-LINE SKATE MARKET HAS CONTRACTED SIGNIFICANTLY. AS A

RESULT, THE COMPANY DETERMINED THAT THE GOODWILL ACQUIRED AT

BAUER HAD BEEN IMPAIRED. THE GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT AT COLE HAAN

REFLECTED THE SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER FAIR VALUE CALCULATED ON THE

BASIS OF REDUCED OPERATING INCOME IN THE YEAR FOLLOWING THE

SEPTEMBER 11, 2001 TERRORIST ATTACKS.

THE REMAINING $87.6 MILLION OF THE IMPAIRMENT CHARGE

RELATES TO TRADEMARKS ASSOCIATED WITH BAUER. UNDER FAS 142,

IMPAIRMENT OF AN INDEFINITE-LIVED ASSET EXISTS IF THE NET BOOK

VALUE OF THE ASSET EXCEEDS ITS FAIR VALUE. THE COMPANY ESTIMATED

THE FAIR VALUE OF TRADEMARKS USING THE RELIEF-FROM-ROYALTY

APPROACH, WHICH IS A STANDARD FORM OF DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW

ANALYSIS TYPICALLY USED FOR THE VALUATION OF TRADEMARKS. THE

IMPAIRMENT OF THE BAUER TRADEMARKS REFLECTS THE SAME

CIRCUMSTANCES AS DESCRIBED ABOVE RELATED TO THE BAUER GOODWILL

IMPAIRMENT.

ACCORDINGLY, THE PROVISIONS MADE DID NOT HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT

ON THE COMPANYS INCOME TAX EXPENSE OR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE

NOTE 16 

RISK MANAGEMENT AND DERIVATIVES

THE COMPANY IS EXPOSED TO GLOBAL MARKET RISKS, INCLUDING THE

EFFECT OF CHANGES IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES AND

INTEREST RATES. THE COMPANY USES DERIVATIVES TO MANAGE FINANCIAL

EXPOSURES THAT OCCUR IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS. THE

COMPANY DOES NOT HOLD OR ISSUE DERIVATIVES FOR TRADING PURPOSES.

THE COMPANY FORMALLY DOCUMENTS ALL RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN HEDGING

INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGED ITEMS, AS WELL AS ITS RISK-MANAGEMENT

OBJECTIVE AND STRATEGY FOR UNDERTAKING HEDGE TRANSACTIONS. THIS

PROCESS INCLUDES LINKING ALL DERIVATIVES TO EITHER SPECIFIC

ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ON THE BALANCE SHEET OR SPECIFIC FIRM

COMMITMENTS OR FORECASTED TRANSACTIONS.

SUBSTANTIALLY ALL DERIVATIVES ENTERED INTO BY THE COMPANY ARE

DESIGNATED AS EITHER CASH FLOW OR FAIR VALUE HEDGES. ALL

DERIVATIVES ARE RECOGNIZED ON THE BALANCE SHEET AT THEIR FAIR

VALUE. UNREALIZED GAIN POSITIONS ARE RECORDED AS OTHER CURRENT

ASSETS OR OTHER NON-CURRENT ASSETS, DEPENDING ON THE

INSTRUMENTS MATURITY DATE. UNREALIZED LOSS POSITIONS ARE

RECORDED AS ACCRUED LIABILITIES OR OTHER NON-CURRENT

LIABILITIES. CHANGES IN FAIR VALUES OF OUTSTANDING CASH FLOW

HEDGE DERIVATIVES THAT ARE HIGHLY EFFECTIVE ARE RECORDED IN

OTHER COMPREHENSIVE

INCOME, UNTIL NET INCOME IS AFFECTED BY THE VARIABILITY OF CASH

FLOWS OF THE HEDGED TRANSACTION. FAIR VALUE HEDGES ARE RECORDED

IN NET INCOME AND ARE OFFSET BY THE CHANGE IN FAIR VALUE OF THE

UNDERLYING ASSET OR LIABILITY BEING HEDGED.

CASH FLOW HEDGES

THE PURPOSE OF THE COMPANYS FOREIGN CURRENCY HEDGING

ACTIVITIES IS TO PROTECT THE COMPANY FROM THE RISK THAT THE

EVENTUAL CASH FLOWS RESULTING FROM TRANSACTIONS IN FOREIGN

CURRENCIES, INCLUDING REVENUES, PRODUCT COSTS, SELLING AND

ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES, INVESTMENTS IN

U.S. DOLLAR-DENOMINATED AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE DEBT SECURITIES

AND INTERCOMPANY TRANSACTIONS, INCLUDING INTERCOMPANY

BORROWINGS, WILL BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY CHANGES IN EXCHANGE

RATES. IT IS THE COMPANYS POLICY TO UTILIZE DERIVATIVES TO

REDUCE FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISKS WHERE INTERNAL NETTING STRATEGIES

CANNOT BE EFFECTIVELY EMPLOYED.

DERIVATIVES USED BY THE COMPANY TO HEDGE FOREIGN CURRENCY

EXCHANGE RISKS ARE FORWARD EXCHANGE CONTRACTS, OPTIONS AND

CROSS-CURRENCY SWAPS. THE CROSS-CURRENCY SWAPS ARE USED TO HEDGE

FOREIGN CURRENCY DENOMINATED PAYMENTS RELATED TO INTERCOMPANY

LOAN AGREEMENTS. THERE ARE CURRENTLY NO CROSS-CURRENCY SWAPS

OUTSTANDING. HEDGED TRANSACTIONS ARE DENOMINATED PRIMARILY IN

EUROS, JAPANESE YEN, CANADIAN DOLLARS, KOREAN WON, AUSTRALIAN

DOLLARS, AND MEXICAN PESOS. THE COMPANY HEDGES UP TO 100% OF

ANTICIPATED EXPOSURES TYPICALLY TWELVE MONTHS IN ADVANCE BUT HAS

HEDGED AS MUCH AS 32 MONTHS IN ADVANCE. WHEN INTERCOMPANY

LOANS ARE HEDGED, IT IS TYPICALLY FOR THEIR EXPECTED DURATION.

SUBSTANTIALLY ALL FOREIGN CURRENCY DERIVATIVES ENTERED INTO BY

THE COMPANY QUALIFY FOR AND ARE DESIGNATED AS FOREIGN-CURRENCY

CASH FLOW HEDGES, INCLUDING THOSE HEDGING FOREIGN CURRENCY

DENOMINATED FIRM COMMITMENTS.

CHANGES IN FAIR VALUES OF OUTSTANDING CASH FLOW HEDGE

DERIVATIVES THAT ARE HIGHLY EFFECTIVE ARE RECORDED IN OTHER

COMPREHENSIVE INCOME, UNTIL NET INCOME IS AFFECTED BY THE

VARIABILITY OF CASH FLOWS OF THE HEDGED TRANSACTION. IN MOST

CASES AMOUNTS RECORDED IN OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME WILL BE

RELEASED TO NET INCOME SOME TIME AFTER THE MATURITY OF THE

RELATED DERIVATIVE. THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF INCOME

CLASSIFICATION OF EFFECTIVE HEDGE RESULTS IS THE SAME AS THAT OF

THE UNDERLYING EXPOSURE. RESULTS OF HEDGES OF REVENUE AND

PRODUCT COSTS ARE RECORDED IN REVENUE AND COST OF SALES,

RESPECTIVELY, WHEN THE UNDERLYING HEDGED TRANSACTION AFFECTS NET

INCOME. RESULTS OF HEDGES OF SELLING AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE

ARE RECORDED TOGETHER WITH THOSE COSTS WHEN THE RELATED EXPENSE

IS RECORDED. RESULTS OF HEDGES OF BOTH ANTICIPATED SALES OF

U.S. DOLLAR-DENOMINATED AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE SECURITIES AND

ANTICIPATED INTERCOMPANY TRANSACTIONS ARE RECORDED IN OTHER

EXPENSE, NET WHEN THE TRANSACTION OCCURS. HEDGES OF RECORDED

BALANCE SHEET POSITIONS ARE RECORDED IN OTHER EXPENSE, NET

CURRENTLY TOGETHER WITH THE TRANSACTION GAIN OR LOSS FROM THE

HEDGED BALANCE SHEET POSITION. NET FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSACTION

GAINS AND LOSSES, WHICH INCLUDES HEDGE RESULTS CAPTURED IN

REVENUES, COST OF SALES, SELLING AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE AND

OTHER EXPENSE, NET, WERE A $217.8 MILLION LOSS, A

$304.3 MILLION LOSS, AND A $180.9 MILLION LOSS FOR THE

YEARS ENDED MAY 31, 2005, 2004, AND 2003, RESPECTIVELY.

PREMIUMS PAID ON OPTIONS ARE INITIALLY RECORDED AS DEFERRED

CHARGES. THE COMPANY ASSESSES EFFECTIVENESS ON OPTIONS BASED ON

THE TOTAL CASH FLOWS METHOD AND RECORDS TOTAL CHANGES IN THE

OPTIONS FAIR VALUE TO OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME TO THE

DEGREE THEY ARE EFFECTIVE.

AS OF MAY 31, 2005, $31.0 MILLION OF DEFERRED NET

LOSSES (NET OF TAX) ON BOTH OUTSTANDING AND MATURED DERIVATIVES

ACCUMULATED IN OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME ARE EXPECTED TO BE

RECLASSIFIED TO NET INCOME DURING THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS AS A

RESULT OF UNDERLYING HEDGED TRANSACTIONS ALSO BEING RECORDED IN

NET INCOME. ACTUAL AMOUNTS ULTIMATELY RECLASSIFIED TO NET INCOME

ARE DEPENDENT ON THE EXCHANGE RATES IN EFFECT WHEN DERIVATIVE

CONTRACTS THAT ARE CURRENTLY OUTSTANDING MATURE. AS OF

MAY 31, 2005, THE MAXIMUM TERM OVER WHICH THE COMPANY IS

HEDGING EXPOSURES TO THE VARIABILITY OF CASH FLOWS FOR ALL

FORECASTED AND RECORDED TRANSACTIONS IS 24 MONTHS.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

NIKE, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

(CONTINUED)

THE COMPANY FORMALLY ASSESSES, BOTH AT A HEDGES INCEPTION

AND ON AN ONGOING BASIS, WHETHER THE DERIVATIVES THAT ARE USED

IN THE HEDGING TRANSACTION HAVE BEEN HIGHLY EFFECTIVE IN

OFFSETTING CHANGES IN THE CASH FLOWS OF HEDGED ITEMS AND WHETHER

THOSE DERIVATIVES MAY BE EXPECTED TO REMAIN HIGHLY EFFECTIVE IN

FUTURE PERIODS. WHEN IT IS DETERMINED THAT A DERIVATIVE IS NOT,

OR HAS CEASED TO BE, HIGHLY EFFECTIVE AS A HEDGE, THE COMPANY

DISCONTINUES HEDGE ACCOUNTING PROSPECTIVELY.

THE COMPANY DISCONTINUES HEDGE ACCOUNTING PROSPECTIVELY WHEN

(1) IT DETERMINES THAT THE DERIVATIVE IS NO LONGER HIGHLY

EFFECTIVE IN OFFSETTING CHANGES IN THE CASH FLOWS OF A HEDGED

ITEM (INCLUDING HEDGED ITEMS SUCH AS FIRM COMMITMENTS OR

FORECASTED TRANSACTIONS); (2) THE DERIVATIVE EXPIRES OR IS

SOLD, TERMINATED, OR EXERCISED; (3) IT IS NO LONGER

PROBABLE THAT THE FORECASTED TRANSACTION WILL OCCUR; OR

(4) MANAGEMENT DETERMINES THAT DESIGNATING THE DERIVATIVE

AS A HEDGING INSTRUMENT IS NO LONGER APPROPRIATE.

WHEN THE COMPANY DISCONTINUES HEDGE ACCOUNTING BECAUSE IT IS NO

LONGER PROBABLE THAT THE FORECASTED TRANSACTION WILL OCCUR IN

THE ORIGINALLY EXPECTED PERIOD, THE GAIN OR LOSS ON THE

DERIVATIVE REMAINS IN ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME AND

IS RECLASSIFIED TO NET INCOME WHEN THE FORECASTED TRANSACTION

AFFECTS NET INCOME. HOWEVER, IF IT IS PROBABLE THAT A FORECASTED

TRANSACTION WILL NOT OCCUR BY THE END OF THE ORIGINALLY

SPECIFIED TIME PERIOD OR WITHIN AN ADDITIONAL TWO-MONTH PERIOD

OF TIME THEREAFTER, THE GAINS AND LOSSES THAT WERE ACCUMULATED

IN OTHER COMPREHENSIVE LOSS WILL BE RECOGNIZED IMMEDIATELY IN

NET INCOME. IN ALL SITUATIONS IN WHICH HEDGE ACCOUNTING IS

DISCONTINUED AND THE DERIVATIVE REMAINS OUTSTANDING, THE COMPANY

WILL CARRY THE DERIVATIVE AT ITS FAIR VALUE ON THE BALANCE

SHEET, RECOGNIZING FUTURE CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE IN OTHER

EXPENSE, NET. ANY HEDGE INEFFECTIVENESS IS RECORDED IN OTHER

EXPENSE, NET. EFFECTIVENESS FOR CASH FLOW HEDGES IS ASSESSED

BASED ON FORWARD RATES.

FOR EACH OF THE YEARS ENDED MAY 31, 2005, 2004 AND 2003 THE

COMPANY RECORDED IN OTHER EXPENSE, NET AN INSIGNIFICANT LOSS

REPRESENTING THE TOTAL INEFFECTIVENESS OF ALL DERIVATIVES. NET

INCOME FOR EACH OF THE YEARS ENDED MAY 31, 2005, 2004 AND

2003 WAS NOT MATERIALLY AFFECTED DUE TO DISCONTINUED HEDGE

ACCOUNTING.

FAIR VALUE HEDGES

THE COMPANY IS ALSO EXPOSED TO THE RISK OF CHANGES IN THE FAIR

VALUE OF CERTAIN FIXED-RATE DEBT ATTRIBUTABLE TO CHANGES IN

INTEREST RATES. DERIVATIVES CURRENTLY USED BY THE COMPANY TO

HEDGE THIS RISK ARE RECEIVE-FIXED, PAY-VARIABLE INTEREST RATE

SWAPS.

SUBSTANTIALLY ALL INTEREST RATE SWAP AGREEMENTS ARE DESIGNATED

AS FAIR VALUE HEDGES OF THE RELATED LONG-TERM DEBT AND MEET THE

SHORTCUT METHOD REQUIREMENTS UNDER FAS 133. ACCORDINGLY,

CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUES OF THE INTEREST RATE SWAP AGREEMENTS

ARE EXACTLY OFFSET BY CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE

UNDERLYING LONG-TERM DEBT. NO INEFFECTIVENESS HAS BEEN RECORDED

TO NET INCOME RELATED TO INTEREST RATE SWAPS DESIGNATED AS FAIR

VALUE HEDGES FOR THE YEARS ENDED MAY 31, 2005, 2004

AND 2003.

AS DISCUSSED IN NOTE 7, DURING THE YEAR ENDED MAY 31,

2004, THE COMPANY ISSUED A $50 MILLION MEDIUM-TERM NOTE

MATURING OCTOBER 1, 2013 AND SIMULTANEOUSLY ENTERED INTO A

RECEIVE-FIXED, PAY-VARIABLE INTEREST RATE SWAP WITH THE SAME

NOTIONAL AMOUNT AND FIXED INTEREST RATE AS THE NOTE. HOWEVER,

THE SWAP EXPIRES OCTOBER 2, 2006. THIS INTEREST RATE SWAP

IS NOT ACCOUNTED FOR AS A FAIR VALUE HEDGE, ACCORDINGLY CHANGES

IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE SWAP ARE RECORDED TO NET INCOME EACH

PERIOD AS A COMPONENT OF OTHER EXPENSE, NET. THE RECORDED FAIR

VALUE OF THE SWAP WAS NOT MATERIAL FOR THE YEARS ENDED

MAY 31, 2005 AND 2004.

IN FISCAL 2003 THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO AN INTEREST RATE SWAP

AGREEMENT RELATED TO A JAPANESE YEN DENOMINATED INTERCOMPANY

LOAN WITH ONE OF THE COMPANYS JAPANESE SUBSIDIARIES. THE

JAPANESE SUBSIDIARY PAYS VARIABLE INTEREST ON THE INTERCOMPANY

LOAN BASED ON 3-MONTH LIBOR PLUS A SPREAD. UNDER THE INTEREST

RATE SWAP AGREEMENT, THE SUBSIDIARY PAYS FIXED INTEREST PAYMENTS

AT 0.8% AND RECEIVES VARIABLE INTEREST PAYMENTS BASED ON 3-MONTH

LIBOR PLUS A SPREAD BASED ON A NOTIONAL AMOUNT OF 8 BILLION

JAPANESE YEN. THIS INTEREST RATE SWAP IS NOT ACCOUNTED FOR AS A

FAIR VALUE HEDGE, ACCORDINGLY CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE

SWAP

CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK

THE COMPANY IS EXPOSED TO CREDIT-RELATED LOSSES IN THE EVENT OF

NON-PERFORMANCE BY COUNTERPARTIES TO HEDGING INSTRUMENTS. THE

COUNTERPARTIES TO ALL DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS ARE MAJOR

FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS WITH INVESTMENT GRADE CREDIT RATINGS.

HOWEVER, THIS DOES NOT ELIMINATE THE COMPANYS EXPOSURE TO

CREDIT RISK WITH THESE INSTITUTIONS. THIS CREDIT RISK IS

GENERALLY LIMITED TO THE UNREALIZED GAINS IN SUCH CONTRACTS

SHOULD ANY OF THESE COUNTERPARTIES FAIL TO PERFORM AS

CONTRACTED. TO MANAGE THIS RISK, THE COMPANY HAS ESTABLISHED

STRICT COUNTERPARTY CREDIT GUIDELINES THAT ARE CONTINUALLY

MONITORED AND REPORTED TO SENIOR MANAGEMENT ACCORDING TO

PRESCRIBED GUIDELINES. THE COMPANY UTILIZES A PORTFOLIO OF

FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS EITHER HEADQUARTERED OR OPERATING IN THE

SAME COUNTRIES THE COMPANY CONDUCTS ITS BUSINESS. AS A RESULT OF

THE ABOVE CONSIDERATIONS, THE COMPANY CONSIDERS THE RISK OF

COUNTERPARTY DEFAULT TO BE MINIMAL.

IN ADDITION TO HEDGING INSTRUMENTS, THE COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO

CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK ASSOCIATED WITH CASH AND

EQUIVALENTS AND ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE. THE COMPANY PLACES CASH AND

EQUIVALENTS WITH FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS WITH INVESTMENT GRADE

CREDIT RATINGS AND, BY POLICY, LIMITS THE AMOUNT OF CREDIT

EXPOSURE TO ANY ONE FINANCIAL INSTITUTION. THE COMPANY CONSIDERS

ITS CONCENTRATION RISK RELATED TO ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE TO BE

MITIGATED BY THE COMPANYS CREDIT POLICY, THE SIGNIFICANCE

OF OUTSTANDING BALANCES OWED BY EACH INDIVIDUAL CUSTOMER AT ANY

POINT IN TIME AND THE GEOGRAPHIC DISPERSION OF THESE CUSTOMERS.
