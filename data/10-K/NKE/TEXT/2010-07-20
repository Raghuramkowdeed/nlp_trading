BUSINESS

GENERAL

NIKE, INC. WAS INCORPORATED IN 1968 UNDER THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF OREGON. AS USED IN THIS REPORT, THE TERMS

WE, US, NIKE AND THE COMPANY REFER TO NIKE, INC. AND ITS PREDECESSORS, SUBSIDIARIES AND AFFILIATES, UNLESS THE CONTEXT INDICATES OTHERWISE. OUR INTERNET ADDRESS IS

WWW.NIKE.COM.

ON OUR NIKE

CORPORATE WEB SITE, LOCATED AT

WWW.NIKEBIZ.COM,

WE POST THE FOLLOWING FILINGS AS SOON AS REASONABLY PRACTICABLE AFTER THEY ARE ELECTRONICALLY FILED WITH OR FURNISHED TO THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION: OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON

FORM 10-K, OUR QUARTERLY REPORTS ON FORM 10-Q, OUR CURRENT REPORTS ON FORM 8-K AND ANY AMENDMENTS TO THOSE REPORTS FILED OR FURNISHED PURSUANT TO SECTION 13(A) OR 15(D) OF THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934, AS AMENDED. ALL SUCH

FILINGS ON OUR NIKE CORPORATE WEB SITE ARE AVAILABLE FREE OF CHARGE. ALSO AVAILABLE ON THE NIKE CORPORATE WEB SITE ARE THE CHARTERS OF THE COMMITTEES OF OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS, AS WELL AS OUR CORPORATE GOVERNANCE GUIDELINES AND CODE OF ETHICS;

OUR PRINCIPAL BUSINESS ACTIVITY IS THE DESIGN, DEVELOPMENT AND WORLDWIDE MARKETING OF HIGH QUALITY FOOTWEAR, APPAREL, EQUIPMENT, AND

ACCESSORY PRODUCTS. NIKE IS THE LARGEST SELLER OF ATHLETIC FOOTWEAR AND ATHLETIC APPAREL IN THE WORLD. WE SELL OUR PRODUCTS TO RETAIL ACCOUNTS, THROUGH NIKE-OWNED RETAIL INCLUDING STORES AND INTERNET SALES, AND THROUGH A MIX OF INDEPENDENT

DISTRIBUTORS AND LICENSEES, IN OVER 170 COUNTRIES AROUND THE WORLD. VIRTUALLY ALL OF OUR PRODUCTS ARE MANUFACTURED BY INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS. VIRTUALLY ALL FOOTWEAR AND APPAREL PRODUCTS ARE PRODUCED OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES, WHILE EQUIPMENT

PRODUCTS ARE PRODUCED BOTH IN THE UNITED STATES AND ABROAD.

PRODUCTS

NIKES ATHLETIC FOOTWEAR PRODUCTS ARE DESIGNED PRIMARILY FOR SPECIFIC ATHLETIC USE, ALTHOUGH A LARGE PERCENTAGE OF THE PRODUCTS ARE

WORN FOR CASUAL OR LEISURE PURPOSES. WE PLACE CONSIDERABLE EMPHASIS ON HIGH QUALITY CONSTRUCTION AND INNOVATION IN PRODUCTS DESIGNED FOR MEN, WOMEN AND CHILDREN. RUNNING, TRAINING, BASKETBALL, SOCCER, SPORT-INSPIRED CASUAL SHOES, AND KIDS

SHOES ARE CURRENTLY OUR TOP-SELLING FOOTWEAR CATEGORIES AND WE EXPECT THEM TO CONTINUE TO LEAD IN PRODUCT SALES IN THE NEAR FUTURE. WE ALSO MARKET FOOTWEAR DESIGNED FOR AQUATIC ACTIVITIES, BASEBALL, CHEERLEADING, FOOTBALL, GOLF, LACROSSE, OUTDOOR

ACTIVITIES, SKATEBOARDING, TENNIS, VOLLEYBALL, WALKING, WRESTLING, AND OTHER ATHLETIC AND RECREATIONAL USES.

WE SELL SPORTS

APPAREL AND ACCESSORIES COVERING MOST OF THE ABOVE CATEGORIES, SPORTS-INSPIRED LIFESTYLE APPAREL, AS WELL AS ATHLETIC BAGS AND ACCESSORY ITEMS. NIKE APPAREL AND ACCESSORIES FEATURE THE SAME TRADEMARKS AND ARE SOLD THROUGH THE SAME MARKETING AND

DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS. WE OFTEN MARKET FOOTWEAR, APPAREL AND ACCESSORIES IN COLLECTIONS OF SIMILAR DESIGN OR FOR SPECIFIC PURPOSES. WE ALSO MARKET APPAREL WITH LICENSED COLLEGE AND PROFESSIONAL TEAM AND LEAGUE LOGOS.

SALES AND MARKETING

FINANCIAL INFORMATION ABOUT GEOGRAPHIC AND SEGMENT OPERATIONS APPEARS IN NOTE 19 OF THE ACCOMPANYING NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS ON PAGE 88.

WE EXPERIENCE MODERATE FLUCTUATIONS IN AGGREGATE SALES VOLUME DURING THE YEAR. HISTORICALLY, REVENUES

IN THE FIRST AND FOURTH FISCAL QUARTERS HAVE SLIGHTLY EXCEEDED THOSE IN THE SECOND AND THIRD QUARTERS. HOWEVER, THE MIX OF PRODUCT SALES MAY VARY CONSIDERABLY AS A RESULT OF CHANGES IN SEASONAL AND GEOGRAPHIC DEMAND FOR PARTICULAR TYPES OF FOOTWEAR,

APPAREL AND EQUIPMENT.

BECAUSE NIKE IS A CONSUMER PRODUCTS COMPANY, THE RELATIVE POPULARITY OF VARIOUS SPORTS AND FITNESS

ACTIVITIES AND CHANGING DESIGN TRENDS AFFECT THE DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS. WE MUST THEREFORE RESPOND TO TRENDS AND SHIFTS IN CONSUMER PREFERENCES BY ADJUSTING THE MIX OF EXISTING PRODUCT OFFERINGS, DEVELOPING NEW PRODUCTS, STYLES AND CATEGORIES, AND

INFLUENCING SPORTS AND FITNESS PREFERENCES THROUGH AGGRESSIVE MARKETING. FAILURE TO RESPOND IN A TIMELY AND ADEQUATE MANNER COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR SALES AND PROFITABILITY. THIS IS A CONTINUING RISK.

WE REPORT OUR NIKE BRAND OPERATIONS BASED ON OUR INTERNAL GEOGRAPHIC ORGANIZATION. EACH NIKE BRAND GEOGRAPHY OPERATES PREDOMINANTLY

IN ONE INDUSTRY: THE DESIGN, PRODUCTION, MARKETING AND SELLING OF SPORTS AND FITNESS FOOTWEAR, APPAREL, AND EQUIPMENT. IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2009, WE INITIATED A REORGANIZATION OF THE NIKE BRAND INTO A NEW MODEL CONSISTING OF SIX

GEOGRAPHIES. EFFECTIVE JUNE 1, 2009, WE BEGAN OPERATING UNDER OUR NEW ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE FOR THE NIKE BRAND, WHICH CONSISTS OF THE FOLLOWING GEOGRAPHIES: NORTH AMERICA, WESTERN EUROPE, CENTRAL AND EASTERN EUROPE, GREATER CHINA,

JAPAN, AND EMERGING MARKETS. PREVIOUSLY, NIKE BRAND OPERATIONS WERE ORGANIZED INTO THE FOLLOWING FOUR GEOGRAPHIC REGIONS: U.S.; EUROPE; MIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA (COLLECTIVELY, EMEA); ASIA PACIFIC; AND AMERICAS.

UNITED STATES MARKET

IN FISCAL 2010 AND 2009, SALES IN THE UNITED STATES INCLUDING U.S. SALES OF OUR OTHER BUSINESSES ACCOUNTED FOR APPROXIMATELY 42% OF TOTAL

REVENUES, COMPARED TO 43% IN FISCAL 2008. FOR FISCAL 2010 AND 2009, OUR OTHER BUSINESSES WERE PRIMARILY COMPRISED OF COLE HAAN, CONVERSE, HURLEY, NIKE GOLF AND UMBRO (WHICH WAS ACQUIRED ON MARCH 3, 2008). FOR FISCAL 2008, OUR OTHER

BUSINESSES WERE PRIMARILY COMPRISED OF COLE HAAN, CONVERSE, EXETER (WHOSE PRIMARY BUSINESS WAS THE STARTER BRAND BUSINESS WHICH WAS SOLD ON DECEMBER 17, 2007), HURLEY, NIKE BAUER HOCKEY (WHICH WAS SOLD ON APRIL 17, 2008), NIKE GOLF

AND UMBRO. WE ESTIMATE THAT WE SELL TO MORE THAN 23,000 RETAIL ACCOUNTS IN THE UNITED STATES. THE NIKE BRAND DOMESTIC RETAIL ACCOUNT BASE INCLUDES A MIX OF FOOTWEAR STORES, SPORTING GOODS STORES, ATHLETIC SPECIALTY STORES, DEPARTMENT STORES, SKATE,

TENNIS AND GOLF SHOPS, AND OTHER RETAIL ACCOUNTS. DURING FISCAL 2010, OUR THREE LARGEST CUSTOMERS ACCOUNTED FOR APPROXIMATELY 24% OF SALES IN THE UNITED STATES.

WE MAKE SUBSTANTIAL USE OF OUR FUTURES ORDERING PROGRAM, WHICH ALLOWS RETAILERS TO ORDER FIVE TO SIX MONTHS IN ADVANCE

OF DELIVERY WITH THE COMMITMENT THAT THEIR ORDERS WILL BE DELIVERED WITHIN A SET TIME

PERIOD AT A FIXED PRICE. IN FISCAL 2010 AND 2009, 89% OF OUR U.S. WHOLESALE FOOTWEAR SHIPMENTS (EXCLUDING OUR OTHER BUSINESSES) WERE MADE UNDER THE FUTURES PROGRAM, COMPARED TO 90% IN FISCAL

2008. IN FISCAL 2010, 62% OF OUR U.S. WHOLESALE APPAREL SHIPMENTS (EXCLUDING OUR OTHER BUSINESSES) WERE MADE UNDER THE FUTURES PROGRAM, COMPARED TO 60% IN FISCAL 2009 AND 62% IN FISCAL 2008.

WE UTILIZE 19 NIKE SALES OFFICES TO SOLICIT SALES IN THE UNITED STATES. WE ALSO UTILIZE 4 INDEPENDENT SALES REPRESENTATIVES TO SELL

SPECIALTY PRODUCTS FOR GOLF AND 5 FOR SKATEBOARDING AND OUTDOOR PRODUCTS. IN ADDITION, WE SELL NIKE BRAND PRODUCTS THROUGH OUR INTERNET WEBSITE,

UNITED STATES, EXCLUDING SALES BY INDEPENDENT DISTRIBUTORS AND LICENSEES. WE OPERATE 14 DISTRIBUTION CENTERS OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES. IN MANY COUNTRIES AND REGIONS, INCLUDING CANADA, ASIA, SOME LATIN AMERICAN COUNTRIES, AND EUROPE, WE HAVE A

NO CUSTOMER ACCOUNTED FOR 10% OR MORE OF OUR NET SALES DURING FISCAL 2010.

ORDERS

WORLDWIDE FUTURES AND ADVANCE ORDERS FOR NIKE BRAND ATHLETIC FOOTWEAR AND APPAREL, SCHEDULED FOR DELIVERY FROM JUNE THROUGH NOVEMBER 2010,

WERE $8.8 BILLION COMPARED TO $7.8 BILLION FOR THE SAME PERIOD LAST YEAR. THIS FUTURES AND ADVANCE ORDER AMOUNT IS CALCULATED BASED UPON OUR FORECAST OF THE ACTUAL EXCHANGE RATES UNDER WHICH OUR REVENUES WILL BE TRANSLATED DURING THIS PERIOD, WHICH

APPROXIMATE CURRENT SPOT RATES. REPORTED FUTURES AND ADVANCE ORDERS ARE NOT NECESSARILY INDICATIVE OF OUR EXPECTATION OF REVENUES FOR THIS PERIOD. THIS IS BECAUSE THE MIX OF ORDERS CAN SHIFT BETWEEN ADVANCE/FUTURES AND AT-ONCE ORDERS AND THE

FULFILLMENT OF CERTAIN OF THESE ADVANCE/FUTURES ORDERS MAY FALL OUTSIDE OF THE SCHEDULED TIME PERIOD NOTED ABOVE. IN ADDITION, FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE FLUCTUATIONS AS WELL AS DIFFERING LEVELS OF ORDER CANCELLATIONS AND DISCOUNTS CAN CAUSE

DIFFERENCES IN THE COMPARISONS BETWEEN FUTURES AND ADVANCE ORDERS AND ACTUAL REVENUES. MOREOVER, A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR REVENUE IS NOT DERIVED FROM FUTURES AND ADVANCE ORDERS, INCLUDING AT-ONCE AND CLOSE-OUT SALES OF NIKE FOOTWEAR AND APPAREL,

WHOLESALE SALES OF EQUIPMENT, COLE HAAN, CONVERSE, HURLEY, UMBRO, NIKE GOLF, AND CERTAIN RETAIL SALES ACROSS ALL BRANDS.

PRODUCT RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

WE BELIEVE OUR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS ARE A KEY FACTOR IN OUR PAST AND

FUTURE SUCCESS. TECHNICAL INNOVATION IN THE DESIGN OF FOOTWEAR, APPAREL, AND ATHLETIC EQUIPMENT RECEIVE CONTINUED EMPHASIS AS NIKE STRIVES TO PRODUCE PRODUCTS THAT HELP TO REDUCE INJURY, ENHANCE ATHLETIC PERFORMANCE AND MAXIMIZE COMFORT.

IN ADDITION TO NIKES OWN STAFF OF SPECIALISTS IN THE AREAS OF BIOMECHANICS, CHEMISTRY, EXERCISE PHYSIOLOGY, ENGINEERING, INDUSTRIAL

DESIGN, AND RELATED FIELDS, WE ALSO UTILIZE RESEARCH COMMITTEES AND ADVISORY BOARDS MADE UP OF ATHLETES, COACHES, TRAINERS, EQUIPMENT MANAGERS, ORTHOPEDISTS, PODIATRISTS, AND OTHER EXPERTS WHO CONSULT WITH US AND REVIEW DESIGNS, MATERIALS, AND

CONCEPTS FOR PRODUCT IMPROVEMENT. EMPLOYEE ATHLETES, ATHLETES ENGAGED UNDER SPORTS MARKETING CONTRACTS AND OTHER ATHLETES WEAR-TEST AND EVALUATE PRODUCTS DURING THE DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT PROCESS.

MANUFACTURING

VIRTUALLY ALL OF OUR FOOTWEAR IS PRODUCED BY FACTORIES WE CONTRACT WITH OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES. IN FISCAL 2010, CONTRACT FACTORIES

IN VIETNAM, CHINA, INDONESIA, THAILAND, AND INDIA MANUFACTURED APPROXIMATELY 37%, 34%, 23%, 2% AND 1% OF TOTAL NIKE BRAND FOOTWEAR, RESPECTIVELY. WE ALSO HAVE MANUFACTURING AGREEMENTS WITH INDEPENDENT FACTORIES IN ARGENTINA, BRAZIL, INDIA, AND

MEXICO TO MANUFACTURE FOOTWEAR FOR SALE PRIMARILY WITHIN THOSE COUNTRIES. THE LARGEST SINGLE FOOTWEAR FACTORY THAT WE HAVE CONTRACTED WITH ACCOUNTED FOR APPROXIMATELY 5% OF TOTAL FISCAL 2010 FOOTWEAR PRODUCTION.

ALMOST ALL OF NIKE BRAND APPAREL IS MANUFACTURED OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES BY INDEPENDENT CONTRACT MANUFACTURERS LOCATED IN 33

COUNTRIES. MOST OF THIS APPAREL PRODUCTION OCCURRED IN CHINA, THAILAND, INDONESIA, MALAYSIA, VIETNAM, SRI LANKA, TURKEY, CAMBODIA, EL SALVADOR, MEXICO, AND TAIWAN. THE LARGEST SINGLE APPAREL FACTORY THAT WE HAVE CONTRACTED WITH ACCOUNTED FOR

APPROXIMATELY 7% OF TOTAL FISCAL 2010 APPAREL PRODUCTION. THE PRINCIPAL MATERIALS USED IN OUR FOOTWEAR PRODUCTS ARE NATURAL AND SYNTHETIC RUBBER, PLASTIC COMPOUNDS, FOAM CUSHIONING MATERIALS, NYLON, LEATHER, CANVAS, AND POLYURETHANE FILMS USED TO

MAKE AIR-SOLE CUSHIONING

4

TABLE OF CONTENTS

COMPONENTS. DURING FISCAL 2010, NIKE IHM, INC., A WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARY OF NIKE, AND INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS IN CHINA AND TAIWAN, WERE OUR LARGEST SUPPLIERS OF THE AIR-SOLE CUSHIONING

COMPONENTS USED IN FOOTWEAR. THE PRINCIPAL MATERIALS USED IN OUR APPAREL PRODUCTS ARE NATURAL AND SYNTHETIC FABRICS AND THREADS, PLASTIC AND METAL HARDWARE, AND SPECIALIZED PERFORMANCE FABRICS DESIGNED TO REPEL RAIN, RETAIN HEAT, OR EFFICIENTLY

TRANSPORT BODY MOISTURE. NIKES CONTRACTORS AND SUPPLIERS BUY RAW MATERIALS IN BULK. MOST RAW MATERIALS ARE AVAILABLE IN THE COUNTRIES WHERE MANUFACTURING TAKES PLACE. WE HAVE THUS FAR EXPERIENCED LITTLE DIFFICULTY IN SATISFYING OUR RAW

MATERIAL REQUIREMENTS.

SINCE 1972, SOJITZ CORPORATION OF AMERICA (SOJITZ AMERICA), A LARGE JAPANESE TRADING

COMPANY, HAS PERFORMED SIGNIFICANT IMPORT-EXPORT FINANCING SERVICES FOR US. DURING FISCAL 2010, SOJITZ AMERICA PROVIDED FINANCING AND PURCHASING SERVICES FOR NIKE BRAND PRODUCTS SOLD IN ARGENTINA, URUGUAY, CANADA, BRAZIL, INDIA, INDONESIA, THE

PHILIPPINES, MALAYSIA, SOUTH AFRICA, CHINA, KOREA, AND THAILAND, EXCLUDING PRODUCTS PRODUCED AND SOLD IN THE SAME COUNTRY. APPROXIMATELY 17% OF NIKE BRAND SALES OCCURRED IN THOSE COUNTRIES. ANY FAILURE OF SOJITZ AMERICA TO PROVIDE THESE SERVICES OR

ANY FAILURE OF SOJITZ AMERICAS BANKS COULD DISRUPT OUR ABILITY TO ACQUIRE PRODUCTS FROM OUR SUPPLIERS AND TO DELIVER PRODUCTS TO OUR CUSTOMERS OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES, EUROPE, MIDDLE EAST, AFRICA AND JAPAN. SUCH A DISRUPTION COULD RESULT

IN CANCELLED ORDERS THAT WOULD ADVERSELY AFFECT SALES AND PROFITABILITY. HOWEVER, WE BELIEVE THAT ANY SUCH DISRUPTION WOULD BE SHORT-TERM IN DURATION DUE TO THE READY AVAILABILITY OF ALTERNATIVE SOURCES OF FINANCING AT COMPETITIVE RATES. OUR CURRENT

AGREEMENTS WITH SOJITZ AMERICA EXPIRE ON MAY 31, 2011.

INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS AND TRADE

OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS AND SOURCES OF SUPPLY ARE SUBJECT TO THE USUAL RISKS OF DOING BUSINESS ABROAD, SUCH AS POSSIBLE REVALUATION

OF CURRENCIES, EXPORT AND IMPORT DUTIES, ANTI-DUMPING MEASURES, QUOTAS, SAFEGUARD MEASURES, TRADE RESTRICTIONS, RESTRICTIONS ON THE TRANSFER OF FUNDS AND, IN CERTAIN PARTS OF THE WORLD, POLITICAL INSTABILITY AND TERRORISM. WE HAVE NOT, TO DATE, BEEN

MATERIALLY AFFECTED BY ANY SUCH RISK, BUT CANNOT PREDICT THE LIKELIHOOD OF SUCH DEVELOPMENTS OCCURRING.

THE CURRENT GLOBAL

ECONOMIC RECESSION HAS RESULTED IN A SIGNIFICANT SLOW DOWN IN INTERNATIONAL TRADE AND A SHARP RISE IN PROTECTIONIST ACTIONS AROUND THE WORLD. THESE TRENDS ARE AFFECTING MANY GLOBAL MANUFACTURING AND SERVICE SECTORS, AND THE FOOTWEAR AND APPAREL

INDUSTRIES, AS A WHOLE, ARE NOT IMMUNE. COMPANIES IN OUR INDUSTRY ARE FACING TRADE PROTECTIONIST CHALLENGES IN MANY DIFFERENT REGIONS, AND IN NEARLY ALL CASES WE ARE WORKING TOGETHER TO ADDRESS TRADE ISSUES TO REDUCE THE IMPACT TO THE INDUSTRY,

WHILE OBSERVING APPLICABLE COMPETITION LAWS. NOTWITHSTANDING OUR EFFORTS, SUCH ACTIONS, IF IMPLEMENTED, COULD RESULT IN INCREASES IN THE COST OF OUR PRODUCTS, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR SALES OR PROFITABILITY AND THE IMPORTED FOOTWEAR AND

APPAREL INDUSTRY AS A WHOLE. ACCORDINGLY, WE ARE ACTIVELY MONITORING THE DEVELOPMENTS DESCRIBED BELOW.

FOOTWEAR IMPORTS

INTO THE EUROPEAN UNION

IN 2005, AT THE REQUEST OF THE EUROPEAN DOMESTIC FOOTWEAR INDUSTRY, THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION

(EC) INITIATED INVESTIGATIONS INTO LEATHER FOOTWEAR IMPORTED FROM CHINA AND VIETNAM. TOGETHER WITH OTHER COMPANIES IN OUR INDUSTRY, WE TOOK THE POSITION THAT SPECIAL TECHNOLOGY ATHLETIC FOOTWEAR (STAF) (I) SHOULD NOT BE WITHIN THE

SCOPE OF THE INVESTIGATION, AND (II) DOES NOT MEET THE LEGAL REQUIREMENTS OF INJURY AND PRICE IN AN ANTI-DUMPING INVESTIGATION. OUR ARGUMENTS WERE SUCCESSFUL AND THE EU AGREED IN OCTOBER 2006 ON DEFINITIVE DUTIES OF 16.5% FOR CHINA AND 10% FOR

VIETNAM FOR NON-STAF LEATHER FOOTWEAR, BUT EXCLUDED STAF FROM THE FINAL MEASURES. PRIOR TO THE SCHEDULED EXPIRATION IN OCTOBER 2008 OF THE MEASURES IMPOSED ON THE NON-STAF FOOTWEAR, THE DOMESTIC INDUSTRY REQUESTED AND THE EC AGREED TO REVIEW A

PETITION TO EXTEND THESE RESTRICTIONS ON NON-STAF LEATHER FOOTWEAR. IN DECEMBER 2009, FOLLOWING A REVIEW OF THE ONGOING RESTRICTIONS, EU MEMBER STATES VOTED TO EXTEND THE MEASURES FOR AN ADDITIONAL 15 MONTHS, UNTIL MARCH 31, 2011. WE EXPECT

THAT A DECISION BY THE EC ON WHETHER TO INITIATE A REVIEW ON THESE MEASURES FOR A SECOND TIME WILL TAKE PLACE BEFORE THE END OF CALENDAR 2010.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

ON FEBRUARY 3, 2010, THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT ANNOUNCED IT WOULD BE SEEKING TO REFER THE

EU DECISION (BOTH ON THE ORIGINAL MEASURES AND SUBSEQUENT REVIEW DECISION) TO THE WORLD TRADE ORGANIZATION (WTO), AND ON MAY 18, 2010, THE DISPUTE SETTLEMENT BODY OF THE WTO AGREED TO ESTABLISH A PANEL TO RULE ON CHINAS CLAIMS

AGAINST THE EU WITH RESPECT TO CURRENT ANTI-DUMPING MEASURES IN FORCE FOR LEATHER FOOTWEAR EXPORTS.

FOOTWEAR IMPORTS INTO

BRAZIL AND ARGENTINA

AT THE REQUEST OF CERTAIN DOMESTIC FOOTWEAR INDUSTRY PARTICIPANTS, BOTH BRAZIL AND ARGENTINA HAVE

INITIATED INDEPENDENT ANTI-DUMPING INVESTIGATIONS AGAINST FOOTWEAR MADE IN CHINA. OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS, WE HAVE BEEN WORKING IN BROAD COALITION WITH OTHER COMPANIES IN OUR INDUSTRY TO CHALLENGE THESE CASES ON THE BASIS THAT THE ATHLETIC FOOTWEAR

BEING IMPORTED FROM CHINA (I) SHOULD NOT BE WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THE INVESTIGATION, AND (II) DOES NOT MEET THE LEGAL REQUIREMENTS OF INJURY AND PRICE IN AN ANTI-DUMPING INVESTIGATION. IN THE CASE OF ARGENTINA, IN 2010, THE FINAL

DETERMINATION MADE BY THE ADMINISTERING AUTHORITIES WAS FAVORABLE TO US. IN THE CASE OF BRAZIL, THE ADMINISTERING AUTHORITIES AGREED TO IMPOSE AN ANTI-DUMPING DUTY AGAINST NEARLY ALL FOOTWEAR FROM CHINA, WHICH WE BELIEVE WILL IMPACT ALL BRANDS IN

THE FOOTWEAR INDUSTRY. ALTHOUGH WE DO NOT CURRENTLY EXPECT THAT THIS DECISION WILL MATERIALLY AFFECT US, WE ARE WORKING WITH THE SAME BROAD COALITION OF FOOTWEAR COMPANIES TO CHALLENGE THIS DECISION IN DOMESTIC BRAZILIAN COURTS AS WELL AS

INTERNATIONAL FORUMS SUCH AS THE WTO.

FOOTWEAR IMPORTS INTO TURKEY

IN 2006, TURKEY INTRODUCED SAFEGUARD MEASURES IN THE FORM OF ADDITIONAL DUTIES ON ALL IMPORTED FOOTWEAR INTO TURKEY WITH THE GOAL OF

PROTECTING ITS LOCAL SHOE MANUFACTURING INDUSTRY UNTIL AUGUST 2009. IN JUNE 2009, TURKISH SHOE-MANUFACTURERS SUBMITTED, AND THE TURKISH GOVERNMENT AGREED TO REVIEW, A REQUEST FOR EXTENSION OF THE SAFEGUARD MEASURES CLAIMING THAT THE REHABILITATION

PROCESS OF THE LOCAL TURKISH INDUSTRY WAS INTERRUPTED DUE TO THE CONTINUING INCREASE OF FOOTWEAR IMPORTS. DESPITE THE IMPORTERS OPPOSITION TO THE CONTINUATION OF THE SAFEGUARD MEASURES, THE TURKISH AUTHORITIES EXTENDED THESE SAFEGUARD MEASURES UNTIL

AUGUST 2012, BUT REDUCED THE DUTY FROM $3 PER PAIR OF FOOTWEAR TO $1.60 PER PAIR OF FOOTWEAR. AS A RESULT OF THIS DECISION, VIETNAM AND INDONESIA EACH INITIATED DISCUSSIONS WITH TURKEY AND EACH IS SEEKING COMPENSATION FROM TURKEY, WHICH IS POSSIBLE

UNDER CURRENT WTO RULES. THESE BILATERAL DISCUSSIONS ARE CURRENTLY ONGOING, AND ONE POTENTIAL OUTCOME COULD INVOLVE TURKEY AWARDING TRADE CONCESSIONS ON OTHER PRODUCTS  OR THE EXCLUSION FROM THE SAFEGUARD MEASURE OF CERTAIN CATEGORIES OF

FOOTWEAR. A CONCLUSION OF THE FIRST ROUND OF TALKS BETWEEN THE EXPORTING COUNTRIES IS EXPECTED IN SEPTEMBER 2010.

TRADE

RELATIONS WITH CHINA

CHINA REPRESENTS AN IMPORTANT SOURCING AND MARKETING COUNTRY FOR US. MANY GOVERNMENTS AROUND THE

WORLD ARE CONCERNED ABOUT CHINAS GROWING AND FAST-PACED ECONOMY, COMPLIANCE WITH WTO RULES, CURRENCY VALUATION, AND HIGH TRADE SURPLUSES. AS A RESULT, A WIDE RANGE OF LEGISLATIVE PROPOSALS HAVE BEEN INTRODUCED TO ADDRESS THESE CONCERNS. WHILE

SOME OF THESE CONCERNS MAY BE JUSTIFIED, WE ARE WORKING WITH BROAD COALITIONS OF GLOBAL BUSINESSES AND TRADE ASSOCIATIONS REPRESENTING A WIDE VARIETY OF SECTORS (E.G., SERVICES, MANUFACTURING, AND AGRICULTURE) TO HELP ENSURE ANY LEGISLATION ENACTED

AND IMPLEMENTED (I) ADDRESSES LEGITIMATE AND CORE CONCERNS, (II) IS CONSISTENT WITH INTERNATIONAL TRADE RULES, AND (III) REFLECTS AND CONSIDERS CHINAS DOMESTIC ECONOMY AND THE IMPORTANT ROLE IT HAS IN THE GLOBAL ECONOMIC

COMMUNITY. WE BELIEVE OTHER COMPANIES IN OUR INDUSTRY AS WELL AS MOST OTHER MULTI-NATIONAL COMPANIES ARE IN A SIMILAR POSITION REGARDING THESE TRADE MEASURES.

IN THE EVENT ANY OF THESE TRADE PROTECTION MEASURES ARE IMPLEMENTED, WE BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO DEVELOP, OVER A PERIOD OF

TIME, ADEQUATE ALTERNATIVE SOURCES OF SUPPLY FOR THE PRODUCTS OBTAINED FROM OUR PRESENT SUPPLIERS. IF EVENTS PREVENTED US FROM ACQUIRING PRODUCTS FROM OUR SUPPLIERS IN A PARTICULAR COUNTRY, OUR OPERATIONS COULD BE TEMPORARILY DISRUPTED AND WE

COULD EXPERIENCE AN ADVERSE FINANCIAL IMPACT. HOWEVER, WE BELIEVE WE COULD ABATE ANY SUCH DISRUPTION, AND THAT MUCH OF THE ADVERSE IMPACT ON SUPPLY WOULD, THEREFORE, BE OF A SHORT-TERM NATURE. WE BELIEVE OUR PRINCIPAL COMPETITORS ARE SUBJECT TO

SIMILAR RISKS.

COMPETITION

THE ATHLETIC FOOTWEAR, APPAREL, AND EQUIPMENT INDUSTRY IS KEENLY COMPETITIVE IN THE UNITED STATES AND ON A WORLDWIDE BASIS. WE COMPETE

INTERNATIONALLY WITH A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF ATHLETIC AND LEISURE SHOE COMPANIES, ATHLETIC AND LEISURE APPAREL COMPANIES, SPORTS EQUIPMENT COMPANIES, AND LARGE COMPANIES HAVING DIVERSIFIED LINES OF ATHLETIC AND LEISURE SHOES, APPAREL, AND EQUIPMENT,

INCLUDING ADIDAS, PUMA, AND OTHERS. THE INTENSE COMPETITION AND THE RAPID CHANGES IN TECHNOLOGY AND CONSUMER PREFERENCES IN THE MARKETS FOR ATHLETIC AND LEISURE FOOTWEAR AND APPAREL, AND ATHLETIC EQUIPMENT, CONSTITUTE SIGNIFICANT RISK FACTORS IN OUR

OPERATIONS.

NIKE IS THE LARGEST SELLER OF ATHLETIC FOOTWEAR AND ATHLETIC APPAREL IN THE WORLD. PERFORMANCE AND RELIABILITY OF

SHOES, APPAREL, AND EQUIPMENT, NEW PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT, PRICE, PRODUCT IDENTITY THROUGH MARKETING AND PROMOTION, AND CUSTOMER SUPPORT AND SERVICE ARE IMPORTANT ASPECTS OF COMPETITION IN THE ATHLETIC FOOTWEAR, APPAREL, AND EQUIPMENT INDUSTRY. TO HELP

MARKET OUR PRODUCTS, WE CONTRACT WITH PROMINENT AND INFLUENTIAL ATHLETES, COACHES, TEAMS, COLLEGES AND SPORTS LEAGUES TO ENDORSE OUR BRANDS AND USE OUR PRODUCTS, AND WE ACTIVELY SPONSOR SPORTING EVENTS AND CLINICS. WE BELIEVE THAT WE ARE COMPETITIVE

IN ALL OF THESE AREAS.

TRADEMARKS AND PATENTS

WE UTILIZE TRADEMARKS ON NEARLY ALL OF OUR PRODUCTS AND BELIEVE HAVING DISTINCTIVE MARKS THAT ARE READILY IDENTIFIABLE

IS AN IMPORTANT FACTOR IN CREATING A MARKET FOR OUR GOODS, IN IDENTIFYING THE COMPANY, AND IN DISTINGUISHING OUR GOODS FROM THE GOODS OF OTHERS. WE CONSIDER OUR

NIKE

®

AND SWOOSH

DESIGN

®

TRADEMARKS TO BE AMONG OUR MOST VALUABLE ASSETS AND WE HAVE REGISTERED THESE TRADEMARKS IN OVER 150

COUNTRIES. IN ADDITION, WE OWN MANY OTHER TRADEMARKS THAT WE UTILIZE IN MARKETING OUR PRODUCTS. WE CONTINUE TO VIGOROUSLY PROTECT OUR TRADEMARKS AGAINST INFRINGEMENT.

NIKE HAS AN EXCLUSIVE, WORLDWIDE LICENSE TO MAKE AND SELL FOOTWEAR USING PATENTED AIR TECHNOLOGY. THE

PROCESS UTILIZES PRESSURIZED GAS ENCAPSULATED IN POLYURETHANE. SOME OF THE EARLY NIKE AIR

®

PATENTS HAVE EXPIRED,

WHICH MAY ENABLE COMPETITORS TO USE CERTAIN TYPES OF SIMILAR TECHNOLOGY. SUBSEQUENT NIKE AIR

®

PATENTS WILL NOT

EXPIRE FOR SEVERAL YEARS. WE ALSO HAVE HUNDREDS OF U.S. AND FOREIGN UTILITY PATENTS, AND THOUSANDS OF U.S. AND FOREIGN DESIGN PATENTS COVERING COMPONENTS AND FEATURES USED IN VARIOUS ATHLETIC AND LEISURE SHOES, APPAREL, AND EQUIPMENT. THESE PATENTS

EXPIRE AT VARIOUS TIMES, AND PATENTS ISSUED FOR APPLICATIONS FILED THIS YEAR WILL LAST FROM NOW TO 2024 FOR DESIGN PATENTS, AND FROM NOW TO 2030 FOR UTILITY PATENTS. WE BELIEVE OUR SUCCESS DEPENDS PRIMARILY UPON SKILLS IN DESIGN, RESEARCH AND

DEVELOPMENT, PRODUCTION, AND MARKETING RATHER THAN UPON OUR PATENT POSITION. HOWEVER, WE HAVE FOLLOWED A POLICY OF FILING APPLICATIONS FOR UNITED STATES AND FOREIGN PATENTS ON INVENTIONS, DESIGNS, AND IMPROVEMENTS THAT WE DEEM VALUABLE.

EMPLOYEES

WE HAD APPROXIMATELY 34,400 EMPLOYEES AT MAY 31, 2010. MANAGEMENT CONSIDERS ITS RELATIONSHIP WITH EMPLOYEES TO BE EXCELLENT. NONE OF

OUR EMPLOYEES IS REPRESENTED BY A UNION, EXCEPT FOR CERTAIN EMPLOYEES IN THE EMERGING MARKETS GEOGRAPHY, WHERE LOCAL LAW REQUIRES THOSE EMPLOYEES TO BE REPRESENTED BY A TRADE UNION, AND IN THE UNITED STATES, WHERE CERTAIN EMPLOYEES OF COLE HAAN ARE

REPRESENTED BY A UNION. ALSO, IN SOME COUNTRIES OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES, LOCAL LAWS REQUIRE REPRESENTATION FOR EMPLOYEES BY WORKS COUNCILS (SUCH AS IN CERTAIN COUNTRIES IN THE EUROPEAN UNION, IN WHICH THEY ARE ENTITLED TO INFORMATION AND

CONSULTATION ON CERTAIN COMPANY DECISIONS) OR OTHER EMPLOYEE REPRESENTATION BY AN ORGANIZATION SIMILAR TO A UNION, AND IN CERTAIN EUROPEAN COUNTRIES, WE ARE REQUIRED BY LOCAL LAW TO ENTER INTO AND/OR COMPLY WITH (INDUSTRY WIDE OR NATIONAL)

COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENTS. THERE HAS NEVER BEEN A MATERIAL INTERRUPTION OF OPERATIONS DUE TO LABOR DISAGREEMENTS.

CONSUMERS AND ENDORSERS; DEMOGRAPHIC CHANGES; CHANGES IN CONSUMER PREFERENCES; POPULARITY OF PARTICULAR DESIGNS, CATEGORIES OF PRODUCTS, AND SPORTS; SEASONAL AND GEOGRAPHIC DEMAND FOR NIKE PRODUCTS; DIFFICULTIES IN ANTICIPATING OR FORECASTING

CHANGES IN CONSUMER PREFERENCES, CONSUMER DEMAND FOR NIKE PRODUCTS, AND THE VARIOUS MARKET FACTORS DESCRIBED ABOVE; DIFFICULTIES IN IMPLEMENTING, OPERATING, AND MAINTAINING NIKES INCREASINGLY COMPLEX INFORMATION SYSTEMS AND CONTROLS,

INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE SYSTEMS RELATED TO DEMAND AND SUPPLY PLANNING, AND INVENTORY CONTROL; INTERRUPTIONS IN DATA AND COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEMS; FLUCTUATIONS AND DIFFICULTY IN FORECASTING OPERATING RESULTS, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,

THE FACT THAT ADVANCE FUTURES ORDERS MAY NOT BE INDICATIVE OF FUTURE REVENUES DUE TO CHANGES IN SHIPMENT TIMING, AND THE CHANGING MIX OF FUTURES AND AT-ONCE ORDERS AND ORDER CANCELLATIONS; THE ABILITY OF NIKE TO SUSTAIN, MANAGE OR

FORECAST ITS GROWTH AND INVENTORIES; THE SIZE, TIMING AND MIX OF PURCHASES OF NIKES PRODUCTS; INCREASES IN THE COST OF MATERIALS AND ENERGY USED TO MANUFACTURE PRODUCTS, NEW PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT AND INTRODUCTION; THE ABILITY TO SECURE AND

AND LEGAL DEVELOPMENTS RELATING TO, CLIMATE CHANGE; LIABILITY AND OTHER CLAIMS ASSERTED AGAINST NIKE; THE ABILITY TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN QUALIFIED PERSONNEL; AND OTHER FACTORS REFERENCED OR INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE IN THIS REPORT AND OTHER REPORTS.

THE RISKS INCLUDED HERE ARE NOT EXHAUSTIVE. OTHER SECTIONS OF THIS REPORT MAY INCLUDE ADDITIONAL FACTORS WHICH COULD

ADVERSELY AFFECT NIKES BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE. MOREOVER, NIKE OPERATES IN A VERY COMPETITIVE AND RAPIDLY CHANGING ENVIRONMENT. NEW RISK FACTORS EMERGE FROM TIME TO TIME AND IT IS NOT POSSIBLE FOR MANAGEMENT TO PREDICT ALL SUCH RISK

FACTORS, NOR CAN IT ASSESS THE IMPACT OF ALL SUCH RISK FACTORS ON NIKES BUSINESS OR THE EXTENT TO WHICH ANY FACTOR, OR COMBINATION OF FACTORS, MAY CAUSE ACTUAL RESULTS TO DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THOSE CONTAINED IN ANY FORWARD-LOOKING

STATEMENTS. GIVEN THESE RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES, INVESTORS SHOULD NOT PLACE UNDUE RELIANCE ON FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS AS A PREDICTION OF ACTUAL RESULTS.

INVESTORS SHOULD ALSO BE AWARE THAT WHILE NIKE DOES, FROM TIME TO TIME, COMMUNICATE WITH SECURITIES ANALYSTS, IT IS AGAINST NIKES

POLICY TO DISCLOSE TO THEM ANY MATERIAL NON-PUBLIC INFORMATION OR OTHER CONFIDENTIAL COMMERCIAL INFORMATION. ACCORDINGLY, SHAREHOLDERS SHOULD NOT ASSUME THAT NIKE AGREES WITH ANY STATEMENT OR REPORT ISSUED BY ANY ANALYST IRRESPECTIVE OF THE CONTENT

OF THE STATEMENT OR REPORT. FURTHERMORE, NIKE HAS A POLICY AGAINST ISSUING OR CONFIRMING FINANCIAL FORECASTS OR PROJECTIONS ISSUED BY OTHERS. THUS, TO THE EXTENT THAT REPORTS ISSUED BY SECURITIES ANALYSTS CONTAIN ANY PROJECTIONS, FORECASTS OR

OPINIONS, SUCH REPORTS ARE NOT THE RESPONSIBILITY OF NIKE.

OUR PRODUCTS FACE INTENSE COMPETITION.

NIKE IS A CONSUMER PRODUCTS COMPANY AND THE RELATIVE POPULARITY OF VARIOUS SPORTS AND FITNESS ACTIVITIES AND CHANGING DESIGN TRENDS AFFECT

THE DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS. THE ATHLETIC FOOTWEAR, APPAREL, AND EQUIPMENT INDUSTRY IS KEENLY COMPETITIVE IN THE UNITED STATES AND ON A WORLDWIDE BASIS. WE COMPETE INTERNATIONALLY WITH A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF ATHLETIC AND LEISURE SHOE COMPANIES,

ATHLETIC AND LEISURE APPAREL COMPANIES, SPORTS EQUIPMENT COMPANIES, AND LARGE COMPANIES HAVING DIVERSIFIED LINES OF ATHLETIC AND LEISURE SHOES, APPAREL, AND EQUIPMENT. WE ALSO COMPETE WITH OTHER COMPANIES FOR THE PRODUCTION CAPACITY OF INDEPENDENT

MANUFACTURERS THAT PRODUCE OUR PRODUCTS AND FOR IMPORT QUOTA CAPACITY.

OUR COMPETITORS PRODUCT OFFERINGS, TECHNOLOGIES,

MARKETING EXPENDITURES (INCLUDING EXPENDITURES FOR ADVERTISING AND ENDORSEMENTS), PRICING, COSTS OF PRODUCTION, AND CUSTOMER SERVICE ARE AREAS OF INTENSE COMPETITION. THIS, IN ADDITION TO RAPID CHANGES IN TECHNOLOGY AND CONSUMER PREFERENCES IN THE

MARKETS FOR

10

TABLE OF CONTENTS

ATHLETIC AND LEISURE FOOTWEAR AND APPAREL, AND ATHLETIC EQUIPMENT, CONSTITUTE SIGNIFICANT RISK FACTORS IN OUR OPERATIONS. IF WE DO NOT ADEQUATELY AND TIMELY ANTICIPATE AND RESPOND TO OUR

COMPETITORS, OUR COSTS MAY INCREASE OR THE CONSUMER DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS MAY DECLINE SIGNIFICANTLY.

IF WE ARE UNABLE TO ANTICIPATE

CONSUMER PREFERENCES AND DEVELOP NEW PRODUCTS, WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO MAINTAIN OR INCREASE OUR NET REVENUES AND PROFITS.

OUR SUCCESS DEPENDS ON OUR ABILITY TO IDENTIFY, ORIGINATE AND DEFINE PRODUCT TRENDS AS WELL AS TO ANTICIPATE, GAUGE AND REACT TO CHANGING

CONSUMER DEMANDS IN A TIMELY MANNER. ALL OF OUR PRODUCTS ARE SUBJECT TO CHANGING CONSUMER PREFERENCES THAT CANNOT BE PREDICTED WITH CERTAINTY. OUR NEW PRODUCTS MAY NOT RECEIVE CONSUMER ACCEPTANCE AS CONSUMER PREFERENCES COULD SHIFT RAPIDLY TO

DIFFERENT TYPES OF PERFORMANCE OR OTHER SPORTS APPAREL OR AWAY FROM THESE TYPES OF PRODUCTS ALTOGETHER, AND OUR FUTURE SUCCESS DEPENDS IN PART ON OUR ABILITY TO ANTICIPATE AND RESPOND TO THESE CHANGES. IF WE FAIL TO ANTICIPATE ACCURATELY AND RESPOND

TO TRENDS AND SHIFTS IN CONSUMER PREFERENCES BY ADJUSTING THE MIX OF EXISTING PRODUCT OFFERINGS, DEVELOPING NEW PRODUCTS, DESIGNS, STYLES AND CATEGORIES, AND INFLUENCING SPORTS AND FITNESS PREFERENCES THROUGH AGGRESSIVE MARKETING, WE COULD

EXPERIENCE LOWER SALES, EXCESS INVENTORIES AND LOWER PROFIT MARGINS, ANY OF WHICH COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

WE RELY ON TECHNICAL INNOVATION AND HIGH QUALITY PRODUCTS TO COMPETE IN THE MARKET FOR OUR PRODUCTS.

ALTHOUGH DESIGN AND AESTHETICS OF OUR PRODUCTS APPEAR TO BE THE MOST IMPORTANT FACTOR FOR CONSUMER ACCEPTANCE OF OUR PRODUCTS, TECHNICAL

INNOVATION AND QUALITY CONTROL IN THE DESIGN OF FOOTWEAR, APPAREL, AND ATHLETIC EQUIPMENT IS ALSO ESSENTIAL TO THE COMMERCIAL SUCCESS OF OUR PRODUCTS. RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT PLAYS A KEY ROLE IN TECHNICAL INNOVATION. WE RELY UPON SPECIALISTS IN THE

FIELDS OF BIOMECHANICS, EXERCISE PHYSIOLOGY, ENGINEERING, INDUSTRIAL DESIGN AND RELATED FIELDS, AS WELL AS RESEARCH COMMITTEES AND ADVISORY BOARDS MADE UP OF ATHLETES, COACHES, TRAINERS, EQUIPMENT MANAGERS, ORTHOPEDISTS, PODIATRISTS, AND OTHER

EXPERTS TO DEVELOP AND TEST CUTTING EDGE PERFORMANCE PRODUCTS. WHILE WE STRIVE TO PRODUCE PRODUCTS THAT HELP TO REDUCE INJURY, ENHANCE ATHLETIC PERFORMANCE AND MAXIMIZE COMFORT, IF WE FAIL TO INTRODUCE TECHNICAL INNOVATION IN OUR PRODUCTS CONSUMER

DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS COULD DECLINE, AND IF WE EXPERIENCE PROBLEMS WITH THE QUALITY OF OUR PRODUCTS, WE MAY INCUR SUBSTANTIAL EXPENSE TO REMEDY THE PROBLEMS.

FAILURE TO CONTINUE TO OBTAIN HIGH QUALITY ENDORSERS OF OUR PRODUCTS COULD HARM OUR BUSINESS.

WE ESTABLISH RELATIONSHIPS WITH PROFESSIONAL ATHLETES, SPORTS TEAMS AND LEAGUES TO EVALUATE, PROMOTE, AND ESTABLISH PRODUCT AUTHENTICITY

WITH CONSUMERS. IF CERTAIN ENDORSERS WERE TO STOP USING OUR PRODUCTS CONTRARY TO THEIR ENDORSEMENT AGREEMENTS, OUR BUSINESS COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED. IN ADDITION, ACTIONS TAKEN BY ATHLETES, TEAMS OR LEAGUES ASSOCIATED WITH OUR PRODUCTS THAT HARM

THE REPUTATIONS OF THOSE ATHLETES, TEAMS OR LEAGUES COULD ALSO HARM OUR BRAND IMAGE WITH CONSUMERS AND, AS A RESULT, COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR SALES AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. IN ADDITION, POOR PERFORMANCE BY OUR ENDORSERS, A FAILURE TO

CONTINUE TO CORRECTLY IDENTIFY PROMISING ATHLETES TO USE AND ENDORSE OUR PRODUCTS, OR A FAILURE TO ENTER INTO COST EFFECTIVE ENDORSEMENT ARRANGEMENTS WITH PROMINENT ATHLETES AND SPORTS ORGANIZATIONS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BRAND AND RESULT IN

DECREASED SALES OF OUR PRODUCTS.

FAILURE OF OUR CONTRACTORS OR OUR LICENSEES CONTRACTORS TO COMPLY WITH OUR CODE OF CONDUCT,

LOCAL LAWS, AND OTHER STANDARDS COULD HARM OUR BUSINESS.

WE CONTRACT WITH HUNDREDS OF CONTRACTORS OUTSIDE OF THE

UNITED STATES TO MANUFACTURE OUR PRODUCTS, AND WE ALSO HAVE LICENSE AGREEMENTS THAT PERMIT UNAFFILIATED PARTIES TO MANUFACTURE OR CONTRACT TO MANUFACTURE PRODUCTS USING OUR TRADEMARKS. WE IMPOSE, AND REQUIRE OUR LICENSEES TO IMPOSE, ON THOSE

CONTRACTORS A CODE OF CONDUCT AND OTHER ENVIRONMENTAL, HEALTH, AND SAFETY STANDARDS FOR THE BENEFIT OF WORKERS. HOWEVER, FROM TIME TO TIME CONTRACTORS MAY NOT COMPLY WITH SUCH STANDARDS OR APPLICABLE LOCAL LAW OR OUR LICENSEES MAY NOT REQUIRE THEIR

CONTRACTORS TO COMPLY WITH SUCH STANDARDS OR APPLICABLE LOCAL LAW. SIGNIFICANT OR CONTINUING NONCOMPLIANCE WITH SUCH STANDARDS AND LAWS BY ONE OR MORE CONTRACTORS COULD HARM OUR REPUTATION AND, AS A RESULT, COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR SALES

AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

11

TABLE OF CONTENTS

GLOBAL CAPITAL AND CREDIT MARKET CONDITIONS, AND RESULTING DECLINES IN CONSUMER CONFIDENCE AND

SPENDING, COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, OPERATING RESULTS, AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

CONTINUING

VOLATILITY AND DISRUPTION IN THE GLOBAL CAPITAL AND CREDIT MARKETS HAVE LED TO A TIGHTENING OF BUSINESS CREDIT AND LIQUIDITY, A CONTRACTION OF CONSUMER CREDIT, BUSINESS FAILURES, HIGHER UNEMPLOYMENT, AND DECLINES IN CONSUMER CONFIDENCE AND SPENDING

IN THE UNITED STATES AND INTERNATIONALLY. IF GLOBAL ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL MARKET CONDITIONS DETERIORATE OR REMAIN WEAK FOR AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF TIME, THE FOLLOWING FACTORS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, OPERATING

RESULTS, AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.



SLOWER CONSUMER SPENDING MAY RESULT IN REDUCED DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS, REDUCED ORDERS FROM RETAILERS FOR OUR PRODUCTS, ORDER CANCELLATIONS, LOWER

REVENUES, INCREASED INVENTORIES, AND LOWER GROSS MARGINS.



WE MAY BE UNABLE TO FIND SUITABLE INVESTMENTS THAT ARE SAFE, LIQUID, AND PROVIDE A REASONABLE RETURN. THIS COULD RESULT IN LOWER INTEREST

INCOME OR LONGER INVESTMENT HORIZONS. DISRUPTIONS TO CAPITAL MARKETS OR THE BANKING SYSTEM MAY ALSO IMPAIR THE VALUE OF INVESTMENTS OR BANK DEPOSITS WE CURRENTLY CONSIDER SAFE OR LIQUID.



WE MAY BE UNABLE TO ACCESS FINANCING IN THE CREDIT AND CAPITAL MARKETS AT REASONABLE RATES IN THE EVENT WE FIND IT DESIRABLE TO DO SO.



THE FAILURE OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTION COUNTERPARTIES TO HONOR THEIR OBLIGATIONS TO US UNDER CREDIT AND DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS COULD JEOPARDIZE OUR

ABILITY TO RELY ON AND BENEFIT FROM THOSE INSTRUMENTS. OUR ABILITY TO REPLACE THOSE INSTRUMENTS ON THE SAME OR SIMILAR TERMS MAY BE LIMITED UNDER POOR MARKET CONDITIONS.



WE CONDUCT TRANSACTIONS IN VARIOUS CURRENCIES, WHICH INCREASE OUR EXPOSURE TO FLUCTUATIONS IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES RELATIVE TO THE U.S.

DOLLAR. CONTINUED VOLATILITY IN THE MARKETS AND EXCHANGE RATES FOR FOREIGN CURRENCIES AND CONTRACTS IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES COULD HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON OUR REPORTED FINANCIAL RESULTS AND CONDITION.



CONTINUED VOLATILITY IN THE MARKETS AND PRICES FOR COMMODITIES AND RAW MATERIALS WE USE IN OUR PRODUCTS AND IN OUR SUPPLY CHAIN (SUCH AS PETROLEUM)

COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR COSTS, GROSS MARGINS, AND PROFITABILITY.



IF RETAILERS OF OUR PRODUCTS EXPERIENCE DECLINING REVENUES, OR RETAILERS EXPERIENCE DIFFICULTY OBTAINING FINANCING IN THE CAPITAL AND CREDIT MARKETS TO

PURCHASE OUR PRODUCTS, THIS COULD RESULT IN REDUCED ORDERS FOR OUR PRODUCTS, ORDER CANCELLATIONS, INABILITY OF RETAILERS TO TIMELY MEET THEIR PAYMENT OBLIGATIONS TO US, EXTENDED PAYMENT TERMS, HIGHER ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, REDUCED CASH FLOWS, GREATER

EXPENSE ASSOCIATED WITH COLLECTION EFFORTS, AND INCREASED BAD DEBT EXPENSE.



IF RETAILERS OF OUR PRODUCTS EXPERIENCE SEVERE FINANCIAL DIFFICULTY, SOME MAY BECOME INSOLVENT AND CEASE BUSINESS OPERATIONS, WHICH COULD REDUCE THE

AVAILABILITY OF OUR PRODUCTS TO CONSUMERS.



IF CONTRACT MANUFACTURERS OF OUR PRODUCTS OR OTHER PARTICIPANTS IN OUR SUPPLY CHAIN EXPERIENCE DIFFICULTY OBTAINING FINANCING IN THE CAPITAL AND CREDIT

MARKETS TO PURCHASE RAW MATERIALS OR TO FINANCE GENERAL WORKING CAPITAL NEEDS, IT MAY RESULT IN DELAYS OR NON-DELIVERY OF SHIPMENTS OF OUR PRODUCTS.

OUR BUSINESS IS AFFECTED BY SEASONALITY, WHICH COULD RESULT IN FLUCTUATIONS IN OUR OPERATING RESULTS AND STOCK PRICE.

WE EXPERIENCE MODERATE FLUCTUATIONS IN AGGREGATE SALES VOLUME DURING THE YEAR. HISTORICALLY, REVENUES IN THE FIRST AND FOURTH FISCAL

QUARTERS HAVE SLIGHTLY EXCEEDED THOSE IN THE SECOND AND THIRD FISCAL QUARTERS. HOWEVER, THE MIX OF PRODUCT SALES MAY VARY CONSIDERABLY FROM TIME TO TIME AS A RESULT OF CHANGES IN SEASONAL AND GEOGRAPHIC DEMAND FOR PARTICULAR TYPES OF FOOTWEAR,

APPAREL AND EQUIPMENT. IN ADDITION, OUR CUSTOMERS MAY CANCEL ORDERS, CHANGE DELIVERY SCHEDULES OR CHANGE THE MIX OF PRODUCTS ORDERED WITH MINIMAL NOTICE. AS A RESULT, WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO ACCURATELY PREDICT OUR QUARTERLY SALES. ACCORDINGLY, OUR

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS ARE LIKELY TO

12

TABLE OF CONTENTS

FLUCTUATE SIGNIFICANTLY FROM PERIOD TO PERIOD. THIS SEASONALITY, ALONG WITH OTHER FACTORS THAT ARE BEYOND OUR CONTROL, INCLUDING GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, CHANGES IN CONSUMER PREFERENCES,

WEATHER CONDITIONS, AVAILABILITY OF IMPORT QUOTAS AND CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE FLUCTUATIONS, COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS AND CAUSE OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS TO FLUCTUATE. OUR OPERATING MARGINS ARE ALSO SENSITIVE TO A NUMBER OF FACTORS THAT ARE

BEYOND OUR CONTROL, INCLUDING SHIFTS IN PRODUCT SALES MIX, GEOGRAPHIC SALES TRENDS, AND CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE FLUCTUATIONS, ALL OF WHICH WE EXPECT TO CONTINUE. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN ANY PERIOD SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED INDICATIVE OF THE RESULTS

TO BE EXPECTED FOR ANY FUTURE PERIOD.

FUTURES ORDERS MAY NOT BE AN ACCURATE INDICATION OF OUR FUTURE REVENUES.

WE MAKE SUBSTANTIAL USE OF OUR FUTURES ORDERING PROGRAM, WHICH ALLOWS RETAILERS TO ORDER FIVE TO SIX MONTHS IN

ADVANCE OF DELIVERY WITH THE COMMITMENT THAT THEIR ORDERS WILL BE DELIVERED WITHIN A SET PERIOD OF TIME AT A FIXED PRICE. OUR FUTURES ORDERING PROGRAM ALLOWS US TO MINIMIZE THE AMOUNT OF PRODUCTS WE HOLD IN INVENTORY, PURCHASING COSTS, THE TIME

NECESSARY TO FILL CUSTOMER ORDERS, AND THE RISK OF NON-DELIVERY. WE REPORT CHANGES IN FUTURES ORDERS IN OUR PERIODIC FINANCIAL REPORTS. ALTHOUGH WE BELIEVE FUTURES ORDERS ARE AN IMPORTANT INDICATOR OF OUR FUTURE REVENUES, REPORTED FUTURES ORDERS ARE

NOT NECESSARILY INDICATIVE OF OUR EXPECTATION OF CHANGES IN REVENUES FOR ANY FUTURE PERIOD. THIS IS BECAUSE THE MIX OF ORDERS CAN SHIFT BETWEEN ADVANCE/FUTURES AND AT-ONCE ORDERS. IN ADDITION, FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE FLUCTUATIONS, ORDER

CANCELLATIONS, RETURNS, AND DISCOUNTS CAN CAUSE DIFFERENCES IN THE COMPARISONS BETWEEN FUTURES ORDERS AND ACTUAL REVENUES. MOREOVER, A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR REVENUE IS NOT DERIVED FROM FUTURES ORDERS, INCLUDING AT-ONCE CLOSE-OUT SALES OF NIKE

FOOTWEAR AND APPAREL, WHOLESALE SALES OF EQUIPMENT, COLE HAAN, CONVERSE, HURLEY, NIKE GOLF AND UMBRO, AND RETAIL SALES ACROSS ALL BRANDS.

OUR FUTURES ORDERING PROGRAM DOES NOT PREVENT EXCESS INVENTORIES OR INVENTORY SHORTAGES, WHICH COULD RESULT IN DECREASED OPERATING

MARGINS AND HARM TO OUR BUSINESS.

WE PURCHASE PRODUCTS FROM MANUFACTURERS OUTSIDE OF OUR FUTURES ORDERING PROGRAM AND

IN ADVANCE OF CUSTOMER ORDERS, WHICH WE HOLD IN INVENTORY AND RESELL TO CUSTOMERS. THERE IS A RISK WE MAY BE UNABLE TO SELL EXCESS PRODUCTS ORDERED FROM MANUFACTURERS. INVENTORY LEVELS IN EXCESS OF CUSTOMER DEMAND MAY RESULT IN INVENTORY

WRITE-DOWNS, AND THE SALE OF EXCESS INVENTORY AT DISCOUNTED PRICES COULD SIGNIFICANTLY IMPAIR OUR BRAND IMAGE AND HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR OPERATING RESULTS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. CONVERSELY, IF WE UNDERESTIMATE CONSUMER DEMAND FOR OUR

PRODUCTS OR IF OUR MANUFACTURERS FAIL TO SUPPLY PRODUCTS WE REQUIRE AT THE TIME WE NEED THEM, WE MAY EXPERIENCE INVENTORY SHORTAGES. INVENTORY SHORTAGES MIGHT DELAY SHIPMENTS TO CUSTOMERS, NEGATIVELY IMPACT RETAILER AND DISTRIBUTOR RELATIONSHIPS,

AND DIMINISH BRAND LOYALTY.

THE DIFFICULTY IN FORECASTING DEMAND ALSO MAKES IT DIFFICULT TO ESTIMATE OUR FUTURE RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION FROM PERIOD TO PERIOD. A FAILURE TO ACCURATELY PREDICT THE LEVEL OF DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR NET REVENUES AND NET INCOME, AND WE ARE UNLIKELY TO FORECAST SUCH EFFECTS WITH ANY CERTAINTY IN

ADVANCE.

WE MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY THE FINANCIAL HEALTH OF OUR RETAILERS.

WE EXTEND CREDIT TO OUR CUSTOMERS BASED ON AN ASSESSMENT OF A CUSTOMERS FINANCIAL CONDITION, GENERALLY WITHOUT REQUIRING COLLATERAL.

TO ASSIST IN THE SCHEDULING OF PRODUCTION AND THE SHIPPING OF SEASONAL PRODUCTS, WE OFFER CUSTOMERS THE ABILITY TO PLACE ORDERS FIVE TO SIX MONTHS AHEAD OF DELIVERY UNDER OUR FUTURES ORDERING PROGRAM. THESE ADVANCE ORDERS MAY BE

CANCELLED, AND THE RISK OF CANCELLATION MAY INCREASE WHEN DEALING WITH FINANCIALLY AILING RETAILERS OR RETAILERS STRUGGLING WITH ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTY. IN THE PAST, SOME CUSTOMERS HAVE EXPERIENCED FINANCIAL DIFFICULTIES, WHICH HAVE HAD AN ADVERSE

EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS. AS A RESULT, RETAILERS MAY BE MORE CAUTIOUS THAN USUAL WITH ORDERS AS A RESULT OF WEAKNESS IN THE RETAIL ECONOMY. A SLOWING ECONOMY IN OUR KEY MARKETS COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE FINANCIAL HEALTH OF OUR CUSTOMERS,

WHICH IN TURN COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. IN ADDITION, PRODUCT SALES ARE DEPENDENT IN PART ON HIGH QUALITY MERCHANDISING AND AN APPEALING STORE ENVIRONMENT TO ATTRACT CONSUMERS, WHICH REQUIRES

CONTINUING INVESTMENTS BY RETAILERS. RETAILERS WHO EXPERIENCE FINANCIAL DIFFICULTIES MAY FAIL TO MAKE SUCH INVESTMENTS OR DELAY THEM, RESULTING IN LOWER SALES AND ORDERS FOR OUR PRODUCTS.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

CONSOLIDATION OF RETAILERS OR CONCENTRATION OF RETAIL MARKET SHARE AMONG A FEW RETAILERS MAY INCREASE

AND CONCENTRATE OUR CREDIT RISK, AND IMPAIR OUR ABILITY TO SELL OUR PRODUCTS.

THE ATHLETIC FOOTWEAR, APPAREL, AND

EQUIPMENT RETAIL MARKETS IN SOME COUNTRIES ARE DOMINATED BY A FEW LARGE ATHLETIC FOOTWEAR, APPAREL, AND EQUIPMENT RETAILERS WITH MANY STORES. THESE RETAILERS HAVE IN THE PAST INCREASED THEIR MARKET SHARE AND MAY CONTINUE TO DO SO IN THE FUTURE BY

EXPANDING THROUGH ACQUISITIONS AND CONSTRUCTION OF ADDITIONAL STORES. THESE SITUATIONS CONCENTRATE OUR CREDIT RISK WITH A RELATIVELY SMALL NUMBER OF RETAILERS, AND, IF ANY OF THESE RETAILERS WERE TO EXPERIENCE A SHORTAGE OF LIQUIDITY, IT WOULD

INCREASE THE RISK THAT THEIR OUTSTANDING PAYABLES TO US MAY NOT BE PAID. IN ADDITION, INCREASING MARKET SHARE CONCENTRATION AMONG ONE OR A FEW RETAILERS IN A PARTICULAR COUNTRY OR REGION INCREASES THE RISK THAT IF ANY ONE OF THEM SUBSTANTIALLY

REDUCES THEIR PURCHASES OF OUR PRODUCTS, WE MAY BE UNABLE TO FIND A SUFFICIENT NUMBER OF OTHER RETAIL OUTLETS FOR OUR PRODUCTS TO SUSTAIN THE SAME LEVEL OF SALES AND REVENUES.

FAILURE TO ADEQUATELY PROTECT OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS.

WE UTILIZE TRADEMARKS ON NEARLY ALL OF OUR PRODUCTS AND BELIEVE THAT HAVING DISTINCTIVE MARKS THAT ARE READILY

IDENTIFIABLE IS AN IMPORTANT FACTOR IN CREATING A MARKET FOR OUR GOODS, IN IDENTIFYING US, AND IN DISTINGUISHING OUR GOODS FROM THE GOODS OF OTHERS. WE CONSIDER OUR

NIKE

®

AND SWOOSH

DESIGN

®

TRADEMARKS TO BE AMONG OUR MOST VALUABLE ASSETS AND WE HAVE REGISTERED THESE TRADEMARKS IN OVER 150

COUNTRIES. IN ADDITION, WE OWN MANY OTHER TRADEMARKS THAT WE UTILIZE IN MARKETING OUR PRODUCTS. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR TRADEMARKS, PATENTS, AND OTHER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS ARE IMPORTANT TO OUR BRAND, OUR SUCCESS, AND OUR COMPETITIVE POSITION. WE

PERIODICALLY DISCOVER PRODUCTS THAT ARE COUNTERFEIT REPRODUCTIONS OF OUR PRODUCTS OR THAT OTHERWISE INFRINGE ON OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS. IF WE ARE UNSUCCESSFUL IN CHALLENGING A PARTYS PRODUCTS ON THE BASIS OF TRADEMARK OR DESIGN OR

UTILITY PATENT INFRINGEMENT, CONTINUED SALES OF THESE PRODUCTS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR SALES AND OUR BRAND AND RESULT IN THE SHIFT OF CONSUMER PREFERENCE AWAY FROM OUR PRODUCTS. THE ACTIONS WE TAKE TO ESTABLISH AND PROTECT TRADEMARKS, PATENTS,

AND OTHER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS MAY NOT BE ADEQUATE TO PREVENT IMITATION OF OUR PRODUCTS BY OTHERS OR TO PREVENT OTHERS FROM SEEKING TO BLOCK SALES OF OUR PRODUCTS AS VIOLATIONS OF PROPRIETARY RIGHTS.

IN ADDITION, THE LAWS OF CERTAIN FOREIGN COUNTRIES MAY NOT PROTECT INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS TO THE SAME EXTENT AS THE LAWS OF THE

UNITED STATES. WE MAY FACE SIGNIFICANT EXPENSES AND LIABILITY IN CONNECTION WITH THE PROTECTION OF OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES, AND IF WE ARE UNABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY PROTECT OUR RIGHTS OR RESOLVE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

CONFLICTS WITH OTHERS, OUR BUSINESS OR FINANCIAL CONDITION MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

WE ARE SUBJECT TO PERIODIC LITIGATION AND OTHER

REGULATORY PROCEEDINGS, WHICH COULD RESULT IN UNEXPECTED EXPENSE OF TIME AND RESOURCES.

FROM TIME TO TIME WE ARE

CALLED UPON TO DEFEND OURSELVES AGAINST LAWSUITS AND REGULATORY ACTIONS RELATING TO OUR BUSINESS. DUE TO THE INHERENT UNCERTAINTIES OF LITIGATION AND REGULATORY PROCEEDINGS, WE CANNOT ACCURATELY PREDICT THE ULTIMATE OUTCOME OF ANY SUCH PROCEEDINGS.

AN UNFAVORABLE OUTCOME COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. IN ADDITION, ANY SIGNIFICANT LITIGATION IN THE FUTURE, REGARDLESS OF ITS MERITS, COULD DIVERT MANAGEMENTS ATTENTION FROM OUR

OPERATIONS AND RESULT IN SUBSTANTIAL LEGAL FEES.

OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS INVOLVE INHERENT RISKS WHICH COULD RESULT IN HARM TO OUR

BUSINESS.

VIRTUALLY ALL OF OUR ATHLETIC FOOTWEAR AND APPAREL IS MANUFACTURED OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES, AND THE

MAJORITY OF OUR PRODUCTS ARE SOLD OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES. ACCORDINGLY, WE ARE SUBJECT TO THE RISKS GENERALLY ASSOCIATED WITH GLOBAL TRADE AND DOING BUSINESS ABROAD, WHICH INCLUDE FOREIGN LAWS AND REGULATIONS, VARYING CONSUMER PREFERENCES

ACROSS GEOGRAPHIC REGIONS, POLITICAL UNREST, DISRUPTIONS OR DELAYS IN CROSS-BORDER SHIPMENTS, AND CHANGES IN ECONOMIC CONDITIONS IN COUNTRIES IN WHICH WE MANUFACTURE OR SELL PRODUCTS. IN

14

TABLE OF CONTENTS

ADDITION, DISEASE OUTBREAKS, TERRORIST ACTS AND MILITARY CONFLICT HAVE INCREASED THE RISKS OF DOING BUSINESS ABROAD. THESE FACTORS, AMONG OTHERS, COULD AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO MANUFACTURE PRODUCTS

OR PROCURE MATERIALS, OUR ABILITY TO IMPORT PRODUCTS, OUR ABILITY TO SELL PRODUCTS IN INTERNATIONAL MARKETS, AND OUR COST OF DOING BUSINESS. IF ANY OF THESE OR OTHER FACTORS MAKE THE CONDUCT OF BUSINESS IN A PARTICULAR COUNTRY UNDESIRABLE OR

IMPRACTICAL, OUR BUSINESS COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED. IN ADDITION, MANY OF OUR IMPORTED PRODUCTS ARE SUBJECT TO DUTIES, TARIFFS, OR QUOTAS THAT AFFECT THE COST AND QUANTITY OF VARIOUS TYPES OF GOODS IMPORTED INTO THE UNITED STATES AND OTHER

COUNTRIES. ANY COUNTRY IN WHICH OUR PRODUCTS ARE PRODUCED OR SOLD MAY ELIMINATE, ADJUST OR IMPOSE NEW QUOTAS, DUTIES, TARIFFS, SAFEGUARD MEASURES, ANTI-DUMPING DUTIES, CARGO RESTRICTIONS TO PREVENT TERRORISM, RESTRICTIONS ON THE TRANSFER OF

CURRENCY, CLIMATE CHANGE LEGISLATION OR OTHER CHARGES OR RESTRICTIONS, ANY OF WHICH COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

CHANGES IN TAX LAWS AND UNANTICIPATED TAX LIABILITIES COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE AND PROFITABILITY.

WE ARE SUBJECT TO INCOME TAXES IN THE UNITED STATES AND NUMEROUS FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS. OUR EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE IN THE FUTURE COULD

BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING: CHANGES IN THE MIX OF EARNINGS IN COUNTRIES WITH DIFFERING STATUTORY TAX RATES, CHANGES IN THE VALUATION OF DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, CHANGES IN TAX LAWS, THE OUTCOME OF INCOME TAX

AUDITS IN VARIOUS JURISDICTIONS AROUND THE WORLD, AND ANY REPATRIATION OF NON-US EARNINGS FOR WHICH WE HAVE NOT PREVIOUSLY PROVIDED FOR U.S. TAXES. WE REGULARLY ASSESS ALL OF THESE MATTERS TO DETERMINE THE ADEQUACY OF OUR TAX PROVISION, WHICH IS

SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT DISCRETION. RECENTLY PROPOSED LEGISLATION IN THE UNITED STATES WOULD CHANGE HOW U.S. MULTINATIONAL CORPORATIONS ARE TAXED ON THEIR FOREIGN INCOME. IF SUCH LEGISLATION IS ENACTED, IT MAY HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT TO OUR

TAX RATE AND IN TURN, OUR PROFITABILITY.

CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE FLUCTUATIONS COULD RESULT IN HIGHER COSTS AND DECREASED MARGINS.

A MAJORITY OF OUR PRODUCTS ARE SOLD OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES. AS A RESULT, WE CONDUCT TRANSACTIONS IN VARIOUS

CURRENCIES, WHICH INCREASE OUR EXPOSURE TO FLUCTUATIONS IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES RELATIVE TO THE U.S. DOLLAR. OUR INTERNATIONAL REVENUES AND EXPENSES GENERALLY ARE DERIVED FROM SALES AND OPERATIONS IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES, AND THESE REVENUES

AND EXPENSES COULD BE AFFECTED BY CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS, INCLUDING AMOUNTS RECORDED IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES AND TRANSLATED INTO U.S. DOLLARS FOR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL REPORTING. CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE FLUCTUATIONS COULD ALSO DISRUPT THE BUSINESS OF

THE INDEPENDENT MANUFACTURERS THAT PRODUCE OUR PRODUCTS BY MAKING THEIR PURCHASES OF RAW MATERIALS MORE EXPENSIVE AND MORE DIFFICULT TO FINANCE. FOREIGN CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL

CONDITION.

OUR HEDGING ACTIVITIES (SEE NOTE 18  RISK MANAGEMENT AND DERIVATIVES IN THE ACCOMPANYING NOTES TO THE

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

),

WHICH ARE DESIGNED TO MINIMIZE AND DELAY, BUT NOT TO COMPLETELY ELIMINATE, THE EFFECTS OF FOREIGN CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS MAY NOT SUFFICIENTLY MITIGATE THE IMPACT OF FOREIGN CURRENCIES ON OUR FINANCIAL

RESULTS. FACTORS THAT COULD AFFECT THE EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR HEDGING ACTIVITIES INCLUDE ACCURACY OF SALES FORECASTS, VOLATILITY OF CURRENCY MARKETS, AND THE AVAILABILITY OF HEDGING INSTRUMENTS. SINCE THE HEDGING ACTIVITIES ARE DESIGNED TO MINIMIZE

VOLATILITY, THEY NOT ONLY REDUCE THE NEGATIVE IMPACT OF A STRONGER U.S. DOLLAR, BUT THEY ALSO REDUCE THE POSITIVE IMPACT OF A WEAKER U.S. DOLLAR. OUR FUTURE FINANCIAL RESULTS COULD BE SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTED BY THE VALUE OF THE U.S. DOLLAR IN

RELATION TO THE FOREIGN CURRENCIES IN WHICH WE CONDUCT BUSINESS. THE DEGREE TO WHICH OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS ARE AFFECTED FOR ANY GIVEN TIME PERIOD WILL DEPEND IN PART UPON OUR HEDGING ACTIVITIES.

OUR PRODUCTS ARE SUBJECT TO RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH OVERSEAS SOURCING, MANUFACTURING, AND FINANCING.

THE PRINCIPAL MATERIALS USED IN OUR APPAREL PRODUCTS  NATURAL AND SYNTHETIC FABRICS AND THREADS, PLASTIC AND METAL HARDWARE, AND

SPECIALIZED PERFORMANCE FABRICS DESIGNED TO REPEL RAIN, RETAIN HEAT, OR EFFICIENTLY TRANSPORT BODY MOISTURE  ARE AVAILABLE IN COUNTRIES WHERE OUR MANUFACTURING TAKES PLACE. THE PRINCIPAL MATERIALS USED IN OUR FOOTWEAR PRODUCTS  NATURAL

AND SYNTHETIC RUBBER, PLASTIC COMPOUNDS, FOAM CUSHIONING MATERIALS, NYLON, LEATHER, CANVAS AND POLYURETHANE FILMS  ARE ALSO LOCALLY AVAILABLE TO MANUFACTURERS. NIKE CONTRACTORS AND SUPPLIERS BUY RAW MATERIALS IN BULK.

15

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THERE COULD BE A SIGNIFICANT DISRUPTION IN THE SUPPLY OF FABRICS OR RAW MATERIALS FROM

CURRENT SOURCES OR, IN THE EVENT OF A DISRUPTION, WE MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO LOCATE ALTERNATIVE SUPPLIERS OF MATERIALS OF COMPARABLE QUALITY AT AN ACCEPTABLE PRICE, OR AT ALL. IN ADDITION, WE CANNOT BE CERTAIN THAT OUR UNAFFILIATED MANUFACTURERS WILL

BE ABLE TO FILL OUR ORDERS IN A TIMELY MANNER. IF WE EXPERIENCE SIGNIFICANT INCREASES IN DEMAND, OR NEED TO REPLACE AN EXISTING MANUFACTURER, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT ADDITIONAL SUPPLIES OF FABRICS OR RAW MATERIALS OR ADDITIONAL MANUFACTURING

CAPACITY WILL BE AVAILABLE WHEN REQUIRED ON TERMS THAT ARE ACCEPTABLE TO US, OR AT ALL, OR THAT ANY SUPPLIER OR MANUFACTURER WOULD ALLOCATE SUFFICIENT CAPACITY TO US IN ORDER TO MEET OUR REQUIREMENTS. IN ADDITION, EVEN IF WE ARE ABLE TO EXPAND

EXISTING OR FIND NEW MANUFACTURING OR SOURCES OF MATERIALS, WE MAY ENCOUNTER DELAYS IN PRODUCTION AND ADDED COSTS AS A RESULT OF THE TIME IT TAKES TO TRAIN SUPPLIERS AND MANUFACTURERS IN OUR METHODS, PRODUCTS, QUALITY CONTROL STANDARDS, AND LABOR,

HEALTH AND SAFETY STANDARDS. ANY DELAYS, INTERRUPTION OR INCREASED COSTS IN THE SUPPLY OF MATERIALS OR MANUFACTURE OF OUR PRODUCTS COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR ABILITY TO MEET RETAIL CUSTOMER AND CONSUMER DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS AND RESULT IN

LOWER REVENUES AND NET INCOME BOTH IN THE SHORT AND LONG-TERM.

BECAUSE INDEPENDENT MANUFACTURERS MANUFACTURE A MAJORITY OF

OUR PRODUCTS OUTSIDE OF OUR PRINCIPAL SALES MARKETS, OUR PRODUCTS MUST BE TRANSPORTED BY THIRD PARTIES OVER LARGE GEOGRAPHIC DISTANCES. DELAYS IN THE SHIPMENT OR DELIVERY OF OUR PRODUCTS DUE TO THE AVAILABILITY OF TRANSPORTATION, WORK STOPPAGES,

PORT STRIKES, INFRASTRUCTURE CONGESTION, OR OTHER FACTORS, AND COSTS AND DELAYS ASSOCIATED WITH CONSOLIDATING OR TRANSITIONING BETWEEN MANUFACTURERS, COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE. IN ADDITION, MANUFACTURING DELAYS OR UNEXPECTED

DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS MAY REQUIRE US TO USE FASTER, BUT MORE EXPENSIVE, TRANSPORTATION METHODS SUCH AS AIRCRAFT, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR PROFIT MARGINS. THE COST OF FUEL IS A SIGNIFICANT COMPONENT IN MANUFACTURING AND TRANSPORTATION

COSTS, SO INCREASES IN THE PRICE OF PETROLEUM PRODUCTS CAN ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR PROFIT MARGINS.

IN ADDITION, SOJITZ AMERICA

PERFORMS SIGNIFICANT IMPORT-EXPORT FINANCING SERVICES FOR MOST OF THE NIKE BRAND PRODUCTS SOLD OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES, EUROPE, MIDDLE EAST, AFRICA, AND JAPAN, EXCLUDING PRODUCTS PRODUCED AND SOLD IN THE SAME COUNTRY. ANY FAILURE OF SOJITZ

AMERICA TO PROVIDE THESE SERVICES OR ANY FAILURE OF SOJITZ AMERICAS BANKS COULD DISRUPT OUR ABILITY TO ACQUIRE PRODUCTS FROM OUR SUPPLIERS AND TO DELIVER PRODUCTS TO OUR CUSTOMERS OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES, EUROPE, MIDDLE EAST, AFRICA, AND

JAPAN. SUCH A DISRUPTION COULD RESULT IN CANCELLED ORDERS THAT WOULD ADVERSELY AFFECT SALES AND PROFITABILITY.

OUR SUCCESS DEPENDS ON

OUR GLOBAL DISTRIBUTION FACILITIES.

WE DISTRIBUTE OUR PRODUCTS TO CUSTOMERS DIRECTLY FROM THE FACTORY AND THROUGH

DISTRIBUTION CENTERS LOCATED THROUGHOUT THE WORLD. OUR ABILITY TO MEET CUSTOMER EXPECTATIONS, MANAGE INVENTORY, COMPLETE SALES AND ACHIEVE OBJECTIVES FOR OPERATING EFFICIENCIES DEPENDS ON THE PROPER OPERATION OF OUR DISTRIBUTION FACILITIES, THE

DEVELOPMENT OR EXPANSION OF ADDITIONAL DISTRIBUTION CAPABILITIES, AND THE TIMELY PERFORMANCE OF SERVICES BY THIRD PARTIES (INCLUDING THOSE INVOLVED IN SHIPPING PRODUCT TO AND FROM OUR DISTRIBUTION FACILITIES). OUR DISTRIBUTION FACILITIES COULD BE

INTERRUPTED BY INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY PROBLEMS AND DISASTERS SUCH AS EARTHQUAKES OR FIRES. ANY SIGNIFICANT FAILURE IN OUR DISTRIBUTION FACILITIES COULD RESULT IN AN ADVERSE AFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS. WE MAINTAIN BUSINESS INTERRUPTION INSURANCE, BUT IT

MAY NOT ADEQUATELY PROTECT US FROM ADVERSE EFFECTS THAT COULD BE CAUSED BY SIGNIFICANT DISRUPTIONS IN OUR DISTRIBUTION FACILITIES.

WE

RELY SIGNIFICANTLY ON INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY IN OUR SUPPLY CHAIN, AND ANY FAILURE, INADEQUACY, INTERRUPTION OR SECURITY FAILURE OF THAT TECHNOLOGY COULD HARM OUR ABILITY TO EFFECTIVELY OPERATE OUR BUSINESS.

WE ARE HEAVILY DEPENDENT ON INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS ACROSS OUR SUPPLY CHAIN, INCLUDING PRODUCT DESIGN, PRODUCTION, FORECASTING,

ORDERING, MANUFACTURING, TRANSPORTATION, SALES, AND DISTRIBUTION. OUR ABILITY TO EFFECTIVELY MANAGE AND MAINTAIN OUR INVENTORY AND TO SHIP PRODUCTS TO CUSTOMERS ON A TIMELY BASIS DEPENDS SIGNIFICANTLY ON THE RELIABILITY OF THESE SUPPLY CHAIN

SYSTEMS. OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS, AS PART OF THE ONGOING INITIATIVE TO UPGRADE OUR WORLDWIDE SUPPLY CHAIN, WE HAVE IMPLEMENTED NEW SYSTEMS IN ALL OF OUR GEOGRAPHICAL REGIONS IN WHICH WE OPERATE. OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS, WE WILL WORK TO CONTINUE

TO ENHANCE THE SYSTEMS AND

16

TABLE OF CONTENTS

RELATED PROCESSES IN OUR GLOBAL OPERATIONS. THE FAILURE OF THESE SYSTEMS TO OPERATE EFFECTIVELY, PROBLEMS WITH TRANSITIONING TO UPGRADED OR REPLACEMENT SYSTEMS, OR A BREACH IN SECURITY OF THESE

SYSTEMS COULD CAUSE DELAYS IN PRODUCT FULFILLMENT AND REDUCED EFFICIENCY OF OUR OPERATIONS, COULD REQUIRE SIGNIFICANT CAPITAL INVESTMENTS TO REMEDIATE THE PROBLEM, AND MAY HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED IF SUBSTANTIAL INVESTMENTS IN BUSINESSES AND OPERATIONS FAIL TO PRODUCE EXPECTED

RETURNS.

FROM TIME TO TIME, WE MAY INVEST IN BUSINESS INFRASTRUCTURE, ACQUISITIONS OF NEW BUSINESSES, AND EXPANSION OF

EXISTING BUSINESSES, SUCH AS OUR RETAIL OPERATIONS, WHICH REQUIRE SUBSTANTIAL CASH INVESTMENTS AND MANAGEMENT ATTENTION. WE BELIEVE COST EFFECTIVE INVESTMENTS ARE ESSENTIAL TO BUSINESS GROWTH AND PROFITABILITY. HOWEVER, SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS ARE

SUBJECT TO TYPICAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES INHERENT IN ACQUIRING OR EXPANDING A BUSINESS. THE FAILURE OF ANY SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT TO PROVIDE THE RETURNS OR PROFITABILITY WE EXPECT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS AND

DIVERT MANAGEMENT ATTENTION FROM MORE PROFITABLE BUSINESS OPERATIONS.

WE DEPEND ON KEY PERSONNEL, THE LOSS OF WHOM WOULD HARM OUR

BUSINESS.

OUR FUTURE SUCCESS WILL DEPEND IN PART ON THE CONTINUED SERVICE OF KEY EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AND PERSONNEL. THE

LOSS OF THE SERVICES OF ANY KEY INDIVIDUAL COULD HARM US. OUR FUTURE SUCCESS ALSO DEPENDS ON OUR ABILITY TO IDENTIFY, ATTRACT AND RETAIN ADDITIONAL QUALIFIED PERSONNEL. COMPETITION FOR EMPLOYEES IN OUR INDUSTRY IS INTENSE AND WE MAY NOT BE

SUCCESSFUL IN ATTRACTING AND RETAINING SUCH PERSONNEL.

THE SALE OF A LARGE NUMBER OF SHARES HELD BY OUR CHAIRMAN COULD DEPRESS THE

MARKET PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK.

PHILIP H. KNIGHT, CO-FOUNDER AND CHAIRMAN OF OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS, BENEFICIALLY

OWNS OVER 74% OF OUR CLASS A COMMON STOCK. IF ALL OF HIS CLASS A COMMON STOCK WERE CONVERTED INTO CLASS B COMMON STOCK, MR. KNIGHT WOULD OWN OVER 14% OF OUR CLASS B COMMON STOCK. THESE SHARES ARE AVAILABLE FOR RESALE, SUBJECT TO THE

REQUIREMENTS OF THE U.S. SECURITIES LAWS. THE SALE OR PROSPECT OF THE SALE OF A SUBSTANTIAL NUMBER OF THESE SHARES COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE MARKET PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK.

ANTI-TAKEOVER PROVISIONS MAY IMPAIR AN ACQUISITION OF THE COMPANY OR REDUCE THE PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK.

THERE ARE PROVISIONS OF OUR ARTICLES OF INCORPORATION AND OREGON LAW THAT ARE INTENDED TO PROTECT SHAREHOLDER INTERESTS BY PROVIDING THE

BOARD OF DIRECTORS A MEANS TO ATTEMPT TO DENY COERCIVE TAKEOVER ATTEMPTS OR TO NEGOTIATE WITH A POTENTIAL ACQUIRER IN ORDER TO OBTAIN MORE FAVORABLE TERMS. SUCH PROVISIONS INCLUDE A CONTROL SHARE ACQUISITION STATUTE, A FREEZEOUT STATUTE, TWO CLASSES

OF STOCK THAT VOTE SEPARATELY ON CERTAIN ISSUES, AND THE FACT THAT HOLDERS OF CLASS A COMMON STOCK ELECT THREE-FOURTHS OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS ROUNDED DOWN TO THE NEXT WHOLE NUMBER. HOWEVER, SUCH PROVISIONS COULD DISCOURAGE, DELAY OR PREVENT

AN UNSOLICITED MERGER, ACQUISITION OR OTHER CHANGE IN CONTROL OF OUR COMPANY THAT SOME SHAREHOLDERS MIGHT BELIEVE TO BE IN THEIR BEST INTERESTS OR IN WHICH SHAREHOLDERS MIGHT RECEIVE A PREMIUM FOR THEIR COMMON STOCK OVER THE PREVAILING MARKET PRICE.

THESE PROVISIONS COULD ALSO DISCOURAGE PROXY CONTESTS FOR CONTROL OF THE COMPANY.

WE MAY FAIL TO MEET ANALYST EXPECTATIONS, WHICH COULD

CAUSE THE PRICE OF OUR STOCK TO DECLINE.

OUR CLASS B COMMON STOCK IS TRADED PUBLICLY, AND AT ANY GIVEN TIME VARIOUS

SECURITIES ANALYSTS FOLLOW OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS AND ISSUE REPORTS ON US. THESE REPORTS INCLUDE INFORMATION ABOUT OUR HISTORICAL FINANCIAL RESULTS AS WELL AS THE ANALYSTS ESTIMATES OF OUR FUTURE PERFORMANCE. THE ANALYSTS ESTIMATES ARE

BASED UPON THEIR OWN OPINIONS AND ARE OFTEN DIFFERENT FROM OUR ESTIMATES OR EXPECTATIONS. IF OUR OPERATING RESULTS ARE BELOW THE ESTIMATES OR EXPECTATIONS OF PUBLIC MARKET ANALYSTS AND INVESTORS, OUR STOCK PRICE COULD DECLINE. IN THE PAST,

SECURITIES CLASS ACTION LITIGATION HAS BEEN BROUGHT AGAINST NIKE AND OTHER COMPANIES FOLLOWING A DECLINE IN THE MARKET PRICE OF THEIR SECURITIES. IF OUR STOCK PRICE IS VOLATILE, WE MAY BECOME INVOLVED IN THIS TYPE OF LITIGATION IN THE FUTURE. ANY

LITIGATION COULD RESULT IN SUBSTANTIAL COSTS AND A DIVERSION OF MANAGEMENTS ATTENTION AND RESOURCES THAT ARE NEEDED TO SUCCESSFULLY RUN OUR BUSINESS.

PROPERTIES

THE FOLLOWING IS A SUMMARY OF PRINCIPAL PROPERTIES OWNED OR LEASED BY NIKE.

THE NIKE WORLD CAMPUS, OWNED BY NIKE AND LOCATED IN BEAVERTON, OREGON, USA, IS A 176 ACRE FACILITY OF 18 BUILDINGS WHICH FUNCTIONS AS OUR

WORLD HEADQUARTERS AND IS OCCUPIED BY ALMOST 5,800 EMPLOYEES ENGAGED IN MANAGEMENT, RESEARCH, DESIGN, DEVELOPMENT, MARKETING, FINANCE, AND OTHER ADMINISTRATIVE FUNCTIONS FROM NEARLY ALL OF OUR DIVISIONS. WE ALSO LEASE VARIOUS OFFICE FACILITIES IN

THE SURROUNDING METROPOLITAN AREA. WE LEASE A SIMILAR, BUT SMALLER, ADMINISTRATIVE FACILITY IN HILVERSUM, THE NETHERLANDS, WHICH SERVES AS THE HEADQUARTERS FOR THE WESTERN EUROPE AND CENTRAL AND EASTERN EUROPE GEOGRAPHIES.

OF THEM ARE LOCATED IN MEMPHIS, TENNESSEE, ONE OF WHICH IS LEASED. IN THE UNITED STATES, NIKE BRAND APPAREL AND EQUIPMENT ARE SHIPPED FROM OUR MEMPHIS, TENNESSEE AND FOOTHILL RANCH, CALIFORNIA DISTRIBUTION CENTERS, WHICH WE LEASE. COLE HAAN ALSO

OPERATES A DISTRIBUTION FACILITY IN GREENLAND, NEW HAMPSHIRE, WHICH WE LEASE. SMALLER LEASED DISTRIBUTION FACILITIES FOR OTHER BRANDS AND NON-NIKE BRAND BUSINESSES ARE LOCATED IN VARIOUS PARTS OF THE UNITED STATES. WE ALSO OWN OR LEASE DISTRIBUTION

AND CUSTOMER SERVICE FACILITIES IN MANY PARTS OF THE WORLD, THE MOST SIGNIFICANT OF WHICH ARE THE DISTRIBUTION FACILITIES LOCATED IN TOMISATOMACHI, JAPAN, AND IN LAAKDAL, BELGIUM, BOTH OF WHICH WE OWN.

WE MANUFACTURE AIR-SOLE CUSHIONING MATERIALS AND COMPONENTS AT NIKE IHM, INC. MANUFACTURING FACILITIES LOCATED IN BEAVERTON, OREGON AND

ST. CHARLES, MISSOURI, WHICH WE OWN. WE ALSO MANUFACTURE AND SELL SMALL AMOUNTS OF VARIOUS PLASTIC PRODUCTS TO OTHER MANUFACTURERS THROUGH NIKE IHM, INC.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

OVERVIEW

NIKE DESIGNS,

DEVELOPS AND MARKETS HIGH QUALITY FOOTWEAR, APPAREL, EQUIPMENT AND ACCESSORY PRODUCTS WORLDWIDE. WE ARE THE LARGEST SELLER OF ATHLETIC FOOTWEAR AND APPAREL IN THE WORLD AND SELL OUR PRODUCTS PRIMARILY THROUGH A COMBINATION OF RETAIL ACCOUNTS,

NIKE-OWNED RETAIL, INCLUDING STORES AND E-COMMERCE, INDEPENDENT DISTRIBUTORS, FRANCHISEES AND LICENSEES WORLDWIDE. OUR GOAL IS TO DELIVER VALUE TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS BY BUILDING A PROFITABLE GLOBAL PORTFOLIO OF BRANDED FOOTWEAR, APPAREL, EQUIPMENT AND

ACCESSORIES BUSINESSES. OUR STRATEGY IS TO ACHIEVE LONG-TERM REVENUE GROWTH BY CREATING INNOVATIVE, MUST HAVE PRODUCTS, BUILDING DEEP PERSONAL CONSUMER CONNECTIONS WITH OUR BRANDS, AND DELIVERING COMPELLING RETAIL PRESENTATION AND

EXPERIENCES.

ASIDE FROM ACHIEVING LONG-TERM REVENUE GROWTH, WE CONTINUE TO STRIVE TO DELIVER SHAREHOLDER VALUE BY DRIVING

OPERATING EXCELLENCE IN SEVERAL KEY AREAS.



MAKING OUR SUPPLY CHAIN A COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE, THROUGH OPERATIONAL DISCIPLINE,



REDUCING PRODUCT COSTS THROUGH A CONTINUED FOCUS ON LEAN MANUFACTURING AND PRODUCT DESIGN THAT STRIVES TO ELIMINATE WASTE,



IMPROVING SELLING AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE PRODUCTIVITY BY FOCUSING ON INVESTMENTS THAT DRIVE ECONOMIC RETURNS IN THE FORM OF INCREMENTAL REVENUE AND

GROSS MARGIN, AND LEVERAGING EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE ACROSS OUR PORTFOLIO OF BRANDS TO ELIMINATE DUPLICATIVE COSTS,



IMPROVING WORKING CAPITAL EFFICIENCY, AND



DEPLOYING CAPITAL EFFECTIVELY TO CREATE VALUE FOR OUR SHAREHOLDERS.

THROUGH EXECUTION OF THIS STRATEGY, OUR LONG-TERM FINANCIAL GOALS CONTINUE TO BE.



HIGH SINGLE-DIGIT REVENUE GROWTH,



MID-TEENS EARNINGS PER SHARE GROWTH,



INCREASED RETURN ON INVESTED CAPITAL AND ACCELERATED CASH FLOWS, AND



CONSISTENT RESULTS THROUGH EFFECTIVE MANAGEMENT OF OUR DIVERSIFIED PORTFOLIO OF BUSINESSES.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

SINCE THE ADOPTION OF THIS LONG-TERM STRATEGY IN 2001, NIKE, INC.S REVENUES AND

EARNINGS PER SHARE HAVE GROWN 8% AND 14%, RESPECTIVELY, ON AN ANNUAL COMPOUNDED BASIS. DURING THE SAME PERIOD, OUR RETURN ON INVESTED CAPITAL HAS INCREASED FROM 14% TO 21%. WHILE MACROECONOMIC CONDITIONS IN FISCAL 2010 CONTINUED TO REMAIN

CHALLENGING, PUTTING SIGNIFICANT PRESSURE ON CONSUMER SPENDING IN MOST MARKETS WORLDWIDE, WE HAVE CONTINUED TO FOCUS ON ACHIEVING APPROPRIATE FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE, WHILE EXTENDING OUR MARKET LEADERSHIP AND POSITIONING OURSELVES FOR SUSTAINABLE,

PROFITABLE GROWTH OVER THE LONG TERM.

NIKE, INC.S FISCAL 2010 REVENUES DECLINED 1% TO $19.0 BILLION, NET INCOME

INCREASED 28% TO $1.9 BILLION, AND WE DELIVERED DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE OF $3.86, A 27% INCREASE VERSUS FISCAL 2009. OUR FISCAL 2009 REPORTED RESULTS CONTAIN SIGNIFICANT NON-COMPARABLE TRANSACTIONS, INCLUDING AN AFTER-TAX CHARGE OF $145 MILLION

FOR RESTRUCTURING ACTIVITIES, RECORDED IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF FISCAL 2009, AND AN AFTER-TAX CHARGE OF $241 MILLION FOR THE IMPAIRMENT OF GOODWILL, INTANGIBLE AND OTHER ASSETS OF UMBRO, WHICH WAS RECORDED IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2009.

EXCLUDING THESE NON-COMPARABLE ITEMS, OUR FISCAL 2010 NET INCOME WOULD HAVE INCREASED 2% AND DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE WOULD HAVE INCREASED 1% COMPARED TO FISCAL 2009 (SEE RECONCILIATION OF NET INCOME AND DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE EXCLUDING

NON-COMPARABLE ITEMS BELOW). THE INCREASE IN NET INCOME EXCLUDING NON-COMPARABLE ITEMS WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY AN IMPROVED GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE AND A REDUCTION IN OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE, WHICH MORE THAN OFFSET THE REDUCTION IN REVENUES AND HIGHER

SELLING AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES. THE INCREASE IN GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE WAS PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF FAVORABLE PRODUCT MIX, COST REDUCTION INITIATIVES, LOWER INPUT COSTS AND SALES GROWTH IN OUR NIKE-OWNED RETAIL BUSINESS. OUR YEAR-OVER-YEAR

EFFECTIVE TAX RATE IMPROVEMENT WAS DRIVEN BY CONTINUED BENEFIT FROM OUR INTERNATIONAL BUSINESSES, WHICH ARE GENERALLY TAXED AT RATES LOWER THAN THE U.S. STATUTORY RATE. THE INCREASE IN SELLING AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO

AN INCREASE IN PERFORMANCE-BASED COMPENSATION AS WELL AS INVESTMENTS IN OUR NIKE-OWNED RETAIL BUSINESS, WHICH MORE THAN OFFSET REDUCTIONS IN COMPENSATION EXPENSE RESULTING FROM RESTRUCTURING ACTIVITIES THAT TOOK PLACE IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF FISCAL

2009. FOR FISCAL 2010, DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE GREW AT A SLIGHTLY LOWER RATE THAN NET INCOME GIVEN HIGHER AVERAGE OUTSTANDING SHARES. IN FISCAL 2010, WE INCREASED CASH FLOW FROM OPERATIONS AS A RESULT OF WORKING CAPITAL REDUCTIONS, REFLECTING OUR

EFFORTS TO AGGRESSIVELY MANAGE INVENTORY LEVELS AND ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE COLLECTIONS. AT MAY 31, 2010, OUR INVENTORY AND ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE BALANCES WERE DOWN 13% AND 8%, RESPECTIVELY, COMPARED TO MAY 31, 2009. DURING FISCAL 2010, WE ALSO

RETURNED LARGER AMOUNTS OF CASH TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS THROUGH HIGHER DIVIDENDS AND INCREASED SHARE REPURCHASES COMPARED TO FISCAL 2009.

ALTHOUGH MOST OF OUR BUSINESSES REPORTED REVENUE DECLINES IN THE FIRST HALF OF FISCAL 2010, THE MAJORITY RETURNED TO GROWTH IN THE SECOND

HALF OF FISCAL 2010. FUTURES ORDERS FOR NIKE BRAND FOOTWEAR AND APPAREL SCHEDULED FOR DELIVERY DURING THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF FISCAL 2011 INCREASED 7% AS COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIODS IN THE PRIOR YEAR. WHILE WE CONTINUE TO BELIEVE THAT THE COMPANY

IS WELL POSITIONED FROM A BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL PERSPECTIVE, OUR FUTURE PERFORMANCE IS SUBJECT TO THE INHERENT UNCERTAINTY PRESENTED BY VOLATILE MACROECONOMIC CONDITIONS THAT MAY HAVE AN IMPACT ON OUR OPERATIONS AROUND THE WORLD. THESE CONDITIONS

COULD CONTINUE TO AFFECT OUR BUSINESS IN A NUMBER OF DIRECT AND INDIRECT WAYS, INCLUDING LOWER REVENUE FROM SLOWING CONSUMER/CUSTOMER DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS, REDUCED PROFIT MARGINS AND/OR INCREASED COSTS, CHANGES IN INTEREST AND CURRENCY EXCHANGE

RATES, LACK OF CREDIT AVAILABILITY AND BUSINESS DISRUPTIONS DUE TO DIFFICULTIES EXPERIENCED BY SUPPLIERS AND CUSTOMERS. OUR FUTURE PERFORMANCE IS SUBJECT TO OUR CONTINUED ABILITY TO TAKE APPROPRIATE ACTIONS TO RESPOND TO THESE CONDITIONS.

DURING FISCAL 2009, WE ANNOUNCED A PLAN TO RESTRUCTURE THE ORGANIZATION OF THE COMPANY. AS PART OF THIS PLAN, WE STREAMLINED OUR MANAGEMENT STRUCTURE

AND ELIMINATED REDUNDANCIES TO ENHANCE CONSUMER FOCUS, DRIVE INNOVATION MORE QUICKLY TO MARKET, AND ESTABLISH A MORE SCALABLE COST STRUCTURE. AS A RESULT OF THESE ACTIONS, WE RECORDED $195 MILLION OF PRE-TAX RESTRUCTURING CHARGES IN FISCAL 2009.

(3)

DURING FISCAL 2009, WE RECORDED A NON-CASH IMPAIRMENT CHARGE TO REDUCE THE CARRYING VALUE OF UMBROS GOODWILL, INDEFINITE-LIVED TRADEMARK AND

OTHER ASSETS. THE TAX BENEFIT RELATED TO THIS IMPAIRMENT CHARGE REDUCED OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE BY 250 BASIS POINTS FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED MAY 31, 2009.

RESULTS HAVE BEEN RESTATED USING EXCHANGE RATES FOR THE COMPARATIVE PERIOD TO ENHANCE THE VISIBILITY OF THE UNDERLYING BUSINESS TRENDS EXCLUDING THE

IMPACT OF FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE FLUCTUATIONS.

FISCAL 2010 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2009

EXCLUDING THE EFFECTS OF CHANGES IN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES, REVENUES FOR NIKE, INC. DECLINED 2%, DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY A 2%

DECLINE IN REVENUES FOR THE NIKE BRAND. ALL OF OUR GEOGRAPHIES DELIVERED LOWER REVENUES WITH THE EXCEPTION OF EMERGING MARKETS, REFLECTING A CHALLENGING ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT ACROSS MOST MARKETS, MOST NOTABLY IN OUR WESTERN EUROPE AND CENTRAL AND

EASTERN EUROPE GEOGRAPHIES. BY PRODUCT GROUP, REVENUES FOR OUR WORLDWIDE NIKE BRAND FOOTWEAR BUSINESS WERE DOWN 1% COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR. WORLDWIDE NIKE BRAND APPAREL AND EQUIPMENT REVENUES DECLINED 5% AND 7%, RESPECTIVELY. WHILE OUR WHOLESALE

BUSINESS REMAINS THE LARGEST COMPONENT OF OUR NIKE BRAND REVENUES, OUR NIKE-OWNED RETAIL BUSINESS CONTINUES TO GROW, REPRESENTING APPROXIMATELY 15% OF OUR TOTAL NIKE BRAND REVENUES IN FISCAL 2010 AS COMPARED TO 13% IN FISCAL 2009.

REVENUES FROM OUR OTHER BUSINESSES WERE COMPRISED OF RESULTS FROM COLE HAAN, CONVERSE, INC., HURLEY INTERNATIONAL, LLC, NIKE GOLF AND

UMBRO, LTD. EXCLUDING THE IMPACT OF CURRENCY CHANGES, REVENUES FOR THESE BUSINESSES INCREASED BY 4% FOR FISCAL 2010, DRIVEN BY INCREASED REVENUES AT CONVERSE, UMBRO AND HURLEY, WHICH MORE THAN OFFSET REVENUE DECLINES AT NIKE GOLF AND COLE HAAN.

FUTURES ORDERS

TRANSLATED INTO US DOLLARS AT PRIOR YEAR EXCHANGE RATES, WORLDWIDE FUTURES AND ADVANCE ORDERS FOR NIKE BRAND FOOTWEAR AND APPAREL

SCHEDULED FOR DELIVERY FROM JUNE THROUGH NOVEMBER 2010 WERE 10% HIGHER THAN THE ORDERS REPORTED FOR THE COMPARABLE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD. THIS FUTURES GROWTH WAS DRIVEN BY INCREASES IN UNIT SALES VOLUME FOR OUR FOOTWEAR PRODUCTS AND GROWTH IN

AVERAGE UNIT PRICE FOR BOTH OF OUR APPAREL AND FOOTWEAR PRODUCTS. FUTURES ORDERS INCREASED 7% WHEN TRANSLATED AT FORECASTED EXCHANGE RATES FOR THE NEXT SIX MONTHS, WHICH APPROXIMATE CURRENT SPOT RATES.

THE REPORTED FUTURES AND ADVANCE ORDERS GROWTH IS NOT NECESSARILY INDICATIVE OF OUR EXPECTATION OF REVENUE GROWTH DURING THIS PERIOD.

THIS IS DUE TO YEAR-OVER-YEAR CHANGES IN SHIPMENT TIMING, AND BECAUSE THE MIX OF ORDERS CAN SHIFT BETWEEN ADVANCE/FUTURES AND AT-ONCE ORDERS AND THAT THE FULFILLMENT OF CERTAIN ORDERS MAY FALL OUTSIDE OF THE SCHEDULE NOTED ABOVE. IN ADDITION,

EXCHANGE RATE FLUCTUATIONS AS WELL AS DIFFERING LEVELS OF ORDER CANCELLATIONS AND DISCOUNTS CAN CAUSE DIFFERENCES IN THE COMPARISONS BETWEEN ADVANCE/FUTURES ORDERS AND ACTUAL REVENUES. MOREOVER, A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR REVENUE IS NOT DERIVED

FROM FUTURES AND ADVANCE ORDERS, INCLUDING AT-ONCE AND CLOSE-OUT SALES OF NIKE FOOTWEAR AND APPAREL, SALES OF NIKE EQUIPMENT, SALES FROM OUR OTHER BUSINESSES AND CERTAIN RETAIL SALES ACROSS ALL BRANDS.

FISCAL 2009 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2008

EXCLUDING THE EFFECTS OF CHANGES IN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES, REVENUES FOR NIKE, INC. GREW 4%, DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY A 4% INCREASE IN

REVENUES FOR THE NIKE BRAND. THE NORTH AMERICA GEOGRAPHY CONTRIBUTED NEARLY 1 PERCENTAGE POINT OF THE CONSOLIDATED REVENUE GROWTH FOR FISCAL 2009, WHILE THE REMAINING GEOGRAPHIES CONTRIBUTED

25

TABLE OF CONTENTS

OVER 2 PERCENTAGE POINTS. DURING FISCAL 2009, MOST OF OUR GEOGRAPHIES POSTED HIGHER REVENUES. BY PRODUCT GROUP, OUR WORLDWIDE NIKE BRAND FOOTWEAR BUSINESS REPORTED REVENUE GROWTH OF 6% AND

CONTRIBUTED $575 MILLION OF INCREMENTAL REVENUE. WORLDWIDE NIKE BRAND APPAREL REVENUES WERE IN LINE WITH THE PRIOR YEAR, WHILE EQUIPMENT REVENUES DECLINED 2% OR $20 MILLION.

OUR OTHER BUSINESSES, COMPRISED OF RESULTS FROM COLE HAAN, CONVERSE INC., HURLEY INTERNATIONAL LLC, NIKE GOLF, AND UMBRO IN FISCAL 2009,

CONSTITUTED THE REMAINING REVENUE. IN FISCAL 2008, OUR OTHER BUSINESSES ALSO INCLUDED EXETER BRANDS GROUP (WHOSE PRIMARY BUSINESS WAS THE STARTER BRAND BUSINESS WHICH WAS SOLD ON DECEMBER 17, 2007) AND NIKE BAUER HOCKEY (WHICH WAS SOLD ON

APRIL 17, 2008). UMBRO WAS ACQUIRED ON MARCH 3, 2008. REVENUES FOR THESE BUSINESSES WERE FLAT COMPARED TO FISCAL 2008.

FISCAL 2010

COMPARED TO FISCAL 2009

FOR FISCAL 2010, OUR CONSOLIDATED GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE WAS 140 BASIS POINTS HIGHER THAN THE

PRIOR YEAR. THE PRIMARY FACTORS CONTRIBUTING TO THIS IMPROVEMENT WERE AS FOLLOWS.



IMPROVED IN-LINE PRODUCT MARGINS ACROSS MOST GEOGRAPHIES, DRIVEN BY REDUCED RAW MATERIAL AND FREIGHT COSTS AS WELL AS FAVORABLE CHANGES IN PRODUCT MIX;



IMPROVED INVENTORY POSITIONS, MOST NOTABLY IN NORTH AMERICA AND WESTERN EUROPE, WHICH DROVE A SHIFT IN MIX FROM DISCOUNTED CLOSE-OUT TO HIGHER MARGIN

IN-LINE SALES; AND



GROWTH OF NIKE-OWNED RETAIL AS A PERCENTAGE OF TOTAL REVENUE, ACROSS MOST NIKE BRAND GEOGRAPHIES, DRIVEN BY AN INCREASE IN BOTH NEW STORE OPENINGS AND

COMPARABLE STORE SALES.

TOGETHER, THESE FACTORS INCREASED CONSOLIDATED GROSS MARGINS BY APPROXIMATELY 160

BASIS POINTS FOR FISCAL 2010. THESE INCREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE IMPACT OF UNFAVORABLE CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES, PRIMARILY AFFECTING OUR EMERGING MARKETS AND CENTRAL AND EASTERN EUROPE GEOGRAPHIES.

WE ANTICIPATE OUR GROSS MARGINS IN FISCAL 2011 MAY BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY MACROECONOMIC FACTORS INCLUDING CHANGES IN CURRENCY EXCHANGE

RATES AND RISING COSTS FOR PRODUCT INPUT COSTS. WE ALSO ANTICIPATE HIGHER AIR FREIGHT COSTS AS WE WORK WITH OUR SUPPLIERS TO MEET INCREASING DEMAND FOR CERTAIN RUNNING FOOTWEAR PRODUCTS IN THE FIRST HALF OF THE YEAR.

FISCAL 2009 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2008

DURING FISCAL 2009, THE PRIMARY FACTORS CONTRIBUTING TO THE 10 BASIS POINT DECLINE IN CONSOLIDATED GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE VERSUS THE

PRIOR YEAR WERE LOWER GROSS PRICING MARGINS AND INCREASED DISCOUNTS WHICH, WHEN COMBINED, DECREASED CONSOLIDATED GROSS MARGINS BY APPROXIMATELY 60 BASIS POINTS. THIS DECREASE WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY IMPROVED HEDGE RATES RELATIVE TO THE PRIOR YEAR,

PRIMARILY IN THE WESTERN EUROPE AND CENTRAL AND EASTERN EUROPE GEOGRAPHIES. GROSS PRICING MARGINS WERE LOWER, PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY HIGHER PRODUCT INPUT COSTS, MOST NOTABLY FOR FOOTWEAR PRODUCTS. HIGHER LEVELS OF DISCOUNTS WERE PROVIDED ACROSS ALL

BUSINESSES IN FISCAL 2009 TO MANAGE INVENTORY LEVELS.

FISCAL 2010 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2009

CHANGES IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES INCREASED SELLING AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE BY 1 PERCENTAGE POINT IN FISCAL 2010.

EXCLUDING CHANGES IN EXCHANGE RATES, OPERATING OVERHEAD EXPENSE INCREASED 4% COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR DUE PRIMARILY TO INCREASES IN

PERFORMANCE-BASED COMPENSATION AND INVESTMENTS IN NIKE-OWNED RETAIL. THESE INCREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY REDUCTIONS IN COMPENSATION SPENDING IN FISCAL 2010 AS A RESULT OF RESTRUCTURING ACTIVITIES THAT TOOK PLACE IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF FISCAL

2009.

IN FISCAL 2010, CHANGES IN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES HAD A MINIMAL IMPACT ON DEMAND CREATION EXPENSE. DEMAND CREATION

EXPENSE REMAINED FLAT COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR, AS INCREASES IN SPORTS MARKETING AND DIGITAL MARKETING EXPENSES WERE OFFSET BY REDUCTIONS IN ADVERTISING.

IN FISCAL 2011, WE WILL CONTINUE TO FOCUS OUR RESOURCES ON THOSE INVESTMENTS THAT DRIVE SUSTAINABLE AND PROFITABLE GROWTH. WE EXPECT

DEMAND CREATION WILL INCREASE AT A SLIGHTLY SLOWER RATE THAN REVENUES, WITH SPENDING WEIGHTED TOWARD THE FIRST QUARTER DRIVEN BY KEY EVENTS INCLUDING THE 2010 WORLD CUP. WE ANTICIPATE OPERATING OVERHEAD WILL GROW AT A MID SINGLE-DIGIT RATE, WITH

FASTER GROWTH IN THE FIRST HALF OF THE FISCAL YEAR, DRIVEN BY INCREASED INVESTMENTS IN OUR NIKE-OWNED RETAIL BUSINESS.

FISCAL 2009 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2008

CHANGES IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES DECREASED SELLING AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE BY 2 PERCENTAGE POINTS IN FISCAL 2009. EXCLUDING

CHANGES IN EXCHANGE RATES, OPERATING OVERHEAD INCREASED 6% DURING FISCAL 2009. THE INCREASE IN OPERATING OVERHEAD WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO INVESTMENTS IN GROWTH DRIVERS SUCH AS NIKE-OWNED RETAIL IN THE NORTH AMERICA, WESTERN EUROPE, GREATER

CHINA, AND JAPAN GEOGRAPHIES, INFRASTRUCTURE FOR THE EMERGING MARKETS AND CENTRAL AND EASTERN EUROPE GEOGRAPHIES AS WELL AS FOR OUR NON-NIKE BRAND BUSINESSES, WHICH MORE THAN OFFSET STEPS TAKEN TO REDUCE OPERATING OVERHEAD SPENDING, INCLUDING

IMPLEMENTATION OF A HIRING FREEZE AND REDUCTIONS IN SPENDING FOR TRAVEL AND MEETINGS.

ON A CONSTANT-CURRENCY BASIS, DEMAND

CREATION EXPENSE INCREASED 3% DURING FISCAL 2009. DEMAND CREATION SPENDING DECREASED IN THE SECOND HALF OF FISCAL 2009 AS A RESULT OF ACTIONS TAKEN TO REDUCE SPENDING ACROSS NEARLY ALL DEMAND CREATION RELATED ACTIVITIES, MOST NOTABLY TRADITIONAL

MEDIA AND PRINT ADVERTISING. THE INCREASE IN DEMAND CREATION DURING THE FIRST HALF OF FISCAL 2009 WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO STRATEGIC INVESTMENTS, INCLUDING FIRST QUARTER SPENDING AROUND THE BEIJING SUMMER OLYMPICS AND THE EUROPEAN FOOTBALL

CHAMPIONSHIPS, AND INCREASED INVESTMENTS IN ATHLETE AND TEAM ENDORSEMENTS ACROSS ALL GEOGRAPHIES.

RESTRUCTURING CHARGES

DURING FISCAL 2009, WE RESTRUCTURED THE ORGANIZATION TO STREAMLINE OUR MANAGEMENT STRUCTURE, ENHANCE CONSUMER FOCUS,

DRIVE INNOVATION MORE QUICKLY TO MARKET AND ESTABLISH A MORE SCALABLE COST STRUCTURE. AS A RESULT

27

TABLE OF CONTENTS

OF THESE ACTIONS, WE REDUCED OUR GLOBAL WORKFORCE BY APPROXIMATELY 5% AND INCURRED PRE-TAX RESTRUCTURING CHARGES OF $195 MILLION IN FISCAL 2009, PRIMARILY CONSISTING OF CASH SEVERANCE COSTS.

THESE CHARGES ARE INCLUDED IN CORPORATE FOR SEGMENT REPORTING PURPOSES.

GOODWILL, INTANGIBLE AND OTHER

ASSET IMPAIRMENT

IN FISCAL 2009, WE RECOGNIZED A $401 MILLION PRE-TAX NON-CASH IMPAIRMENT CHARGE TO REDUCE THE

CARRYING VALUE OF UMBROS GOODWILL, INTANGIBLE AND OTHER ASSETS. ALTHOUGH UMBROS FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE FOR FISCAL 2009 WAS SLIGHTLY BETTER THAN WE HAD ORIGINALLY EXPECTED, PROJECTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS HAD FALLEN BELOW THE LEVELS WE

EXPECTED AT THE TIME OF ACQUISITION. THIS EROSION WAS A RESULT OF BOTH THE UNPRECEDENTED DECLINE IN GLOBAL CONSUMER MARKETS, PARTICULARLY IN THE UNITED KINGDOM, AND OUR DECISION TO ADJUST THE LEVEL OF INVESTMENT IN THE BUSINESS.

WE MEASURED THE FAIR VALUE OF UMBRO BY USING AN EQUAL WEIGHTING OF THE FAIR VALUE IMPLIED BY A DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW ANALYSIS AND BY

COMPARISONS WITH THE MARKET VALUES OF SIMILAR PUBLICLY TRADED COMPANIES. WE BELIEVE THE USE OF BOTH MODELS COMPENSATED FOR THE INHERENT RISK ASSOCIATED WITH EITHER MODEL IF USED ON A STAND-ALONE BASIS, AND THIS COMBINATION WAS INDICATIVE OF THE

FACTORS A MARKET PARTICIPANT WOULD CONSIDER WHEN PERFORMING A SIMILAR VALUATION. THE FAIR VALUE OF UMBROS INDEFINITE-LIVED TRADEMARK WAS ESTIMATED USING THE RELIEF FROM ROYALTY METHOD, WHICH ASSUMES THAT THE TRADEMARK HAS VALUE TO THE EXTENT

THAT UMBRO IS RELIEVED OF THE OBLIGATION TO PAY ROYALTIES FOR THE BENEFITS RECEIVED FROM THE TRADEMARK. OUR ASSESSMENTS RESULTED IN THE RECOGNITION OF IMPAIRMENT CHARGES OF $199 MILLION AND $181 MILLION RELATED TO UMBROS GOODWILL AND

TRADEMARK, RESPECTIVELY, IN FISCAL 2009. IN ADDITION TO THE IMPAIRMENT ANALYSIS, WE DETERMINED AN EQUITY INVESTMENT HELD BY UMBRO WAS ALSO IMPAIRED, AND RECOGNIZED A CHARGE OF $21 MILLION RELATED TO THE IMPAIRMENT OF THAT INVESTMENT. THESE CHARGES

ARE INCLUDED IN OUR OTHER BUSINESSES CATEGORY FOR SEGMENT REPORTING PURPOSES.

FISCAL 2010 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2009

OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR FISCAL 2010 WAS 20 BASIS POINTS HIGHER THAN THE EFFECTIVE RATE FOR FISCAL 2009. OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR

FISCAL 2009 INCLUDES A TAX BENEFIT RELATED TO CHARGES RECORDED FOR THE IMPAIRMENT OF UMBROS GOODWILL, INTANGIBLE AND OTHER ASSETS. EXCLUDING THIS TAX BENEFIT, OUR EFFECTIVE RATE FOR FISCAL 2009 WOULD HAVE BEEN 26.5%, 230 BASIS POINTS HIGHER

THAN OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR FISCAL 2010. THE DECREASE IN OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR FISCAL 2010 WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE CONTINUED BENEFIT FROM OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS, WHERE TAX RATES FOR THESE OPERATIONS ARE GENERALLY LOWER THAN

THE U.S. STATUTORY RATE.

WE ESTIMATE THAT OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR FISCAL YEAR 2011 WILL BE IN LINE WITH OUR FISCAL 2010

EFFECTIVE TAX RATE.

FISCAL 2009 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2008

OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR FISCAL 2009 WAS 80 BASIS POINTS LOWER THAN THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR FISCAL 2008 DUE PRIMARILY TO THE TAX

BENEFIT RELATED TO THE IMPAIRMENT OF GOODWILL, INTANGIBLE AND OTHER ASSETS OF UMBRO WHICH HAD A FAVORABLE IMPACT OF 250 BASIS POINTS. PROFITS EARNED OUTSIDE OF THE U.S., THE IMPACT OF THE RESOLUTION OF FOREIGN AUDIT ITEMS AND THE RETROACTIVE

REINSTATEMENT OF THE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT TAX CREDIT ALSO FAVORABLY IMPACTED OUR FISCAL 2009 EFFECTIVE TAX RATE. REFLECTED IN THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR FISCAL 2008 WAS A ONE-TIME TAX BENEFIT OF $105 MILLION, WHICH HAD A FAVORABLE IMPACT OF 420

BASIS POINTS ON OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE.

OPERATING SEGMENTS

AS PART OF THE RESTRUCTURING INITIATIVE THAT TOOK PLACE IN FISCAL 2009, THE COMPANY CHANGED THE GEOGRAPHIC STRUCTURE OF NIKE BRAND TO SIX

GEOGRAPHIES TO STREAMLINE ITS MANAGEMENT STRUCTURE, ENHANCE CONSUMER FOCUS, DRIVE INNOVATION MORE QUICKLY TO MARKET AND ESTABLISH A MORE SCALABLE COST STRUCTURE. EFFECTIVE JUNE 1, 2009, THE COMPANYS NEW REPORTABLE OPERATING SEGMENTS FOR

THE NIKE BRAND BECAME: NORTH AMERICA, WESTERN EUROPE, CENTRAL AND EASTERN EUROPE, GREATER CHINA, JAPAN, AND EMERGING MARKETS. PREVIOUSLY, NIKE BRAND OPERATIONS WERE ORGANIZED INTO FOUR REGIONS: U.S., EUROPE, MIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA (COLLECTIVELY,

EMEA), ASIA PACIFIC, AND AMERICAS.

AS PART OF OUR CENTRALLY MANAGED FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK MANAGEMENT PROGRAM,

STANDARD FOREIGN CURRENCY RATES ARE ASSIGNED TO EACH NIKE BRAND ENTITY IN OUR GEOGRAPHIC OPERATING SEGMENTS AND ARE USED TO RECORD ANY NON-FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY REVENUES OR PRODUCT PURCHASES INTO THE ENTITYS FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY. GEOGRAPHIC

OPERATING SEGMENT REVENUES AND COST OF SALES REFLECT USE OF THESE STANDARD RATES. FOR ALL NIKE BRAND OPERATING SEGMENTS, DIFFERENCES BETWEEN ASSIGNED STANDARD FOREIGN CURRENCY RATES AND ACTUAL MARKET RATES ARE INCLUDED IN CORPORATE TOGETHER WITH

FOREIGN CURRENCY HEDGE GAINS AND LOSSES GENERATED FROM THE CENTRALLY MANAGED FOREIGN

FISCAL 2010 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2009

EXCLUDING THE CHANGES IN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES, REVENUES FOR NORTH AMERICA DECLINED 1%, DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY A DECREASE IN REVENUE FROM

OUR WHOLESALE BUSINESS. THIS DECREASE WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN OUR NIKE-OWNED RETAIL BUSINESS, DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY AN INCREASE IN COMPARABLE STORE SALES. ON A CURRENCY NEUTRAL BASIS, FUTURES ORDERS SCHEDULED TO BE DELIVERED DURING THE

FIRST SIX MONTHS OF FISCAL 2011 WERE 7% HIGHER COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN THE PRIOR YEAR.

DURING FISCAL 2010, THE

DECREASE IN NORTH AMERICA FOOTWEAR REVENUE WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO A LOW SINGLE-DIGIT PERCENTAGE DECREASE IN UNIT SALES, WHILE AVERAGE SELLING PRICE PER PAIR REMAINED FLAT. THE DECLINE IN UNIT SALES WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY LOWER SALES FOR OUR

KIDS AND RUNNING PRODUCTS IN THE FIRST HALF OF FISCAL 2010.

31

TABLE OF CONTENTS

NORTH AMERICA APPAREL REVENUE DURING FISCAL 2010 WAS FLAT WHEN COMPARED TO FISCAL 2009,

WHICH WAS REFLECTIVE OF A HIGH SINGLE-DIGIT PERCENTAGE INCREASE IN AVERAGE SELLING PRICE PER UNIT, OFFSET BY A LOW DOUBLE-DIGIT PERCENTAGE DECREASE IN UNIT SALES. BOTH THE INCREASE IN AVERAGE SELLING PRICE PER UNIT AND THE DECREASE IN UNIT SALES

WERE PRIMARILY A RESULT OF FEWER CLOSE-OUT SALES COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR.

FOR FISCAL 2010, THE INCREASE IN NORTH

AMERICAS EBIT WAS PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF IMPROVED GROSS MARGINS COMBINED WITH A SLIGHT DECREASE IN SELLING AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE, DRIVEN BY A REDUCTION IN DEMAND CREATION EXPENSE COMPARED TO PRIOR YEAR. THE IMPROVEMENT IN GROSS MARGIN

WAS MAINLY ATTRIBUTABLE TO A SHIFT IN MIX FROM CLOSE-OUT TO IN-LINE SALES, GROWTH OF NIKE-OWNED RETAIL AS A PERCENTAGE OF TOTAL SALES, IMPROVED IN-LINE PRODUCT MARGINS AND LOWER WAREHOUSING COSTS. THE REDUCTION IN DEMAND CREATION EXPENSE WAS

PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO LOWER SPENDING ON ADVERTISING.

FISCAL 2009 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2008

DURING FISCAL 2009, THE INCREASE IN NORTH AMERICA FOOTWEAR REVENUE WAS THE RESULT OF LOW SINGLE-DIGIT GROWTH IN BOTH UNIT SALES AND

AVERAGE SELLING PRICE PER PAIR. THE GROWTH IN UNIT SALES WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY HIGHER DEMAND FOR OUR JORDAN BRAND, ACTION SPORTS AND KIDS PRODUCTS. THE INCREASE IN AVERAGE SELLING PRICE PER PAIR WAS ATTRIBUTABLE TO SELECTIVE PRICE INCREASES,

PRIMARILY DURING THE FIRST HALF OF FISCAL 2009, AND INCREASED SALES MIX OF HIGHER PRICED JORDAN BRAND PRODUCTS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY INCREASED SALES MIX OF KIDS PRODUCTS WHICH ARE GENERALLY LOWER PRICED.

THE YEAR-OVER-YEAR DECREASE IN NORTH AMERICA APPAREL REVENUES DURING FISCAL 2009 REFLECTED A MID SINGLE-DIGIT DECREASE IN UNIT SALES,

PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY A REDUCTION IN PRODUCTS SOLD TO VALUE CHANNEL RETAILERS AND GENERALLY SOFTER DEMAND IN THE OVERALL APPAREL MARKET. AVERAGE SELLING PRICES INCREASED SLIGHTLY AS A RESULT OF THE REDUCTION IN PRODUCTS SOLD TO VALUE RETAILERS, MOSTLY

OFFSET BY AN INCREASED MIX OF CLOSE-OUT SALES AND HIGHER LEVELS OF DISCOUNTS PROVIDED RETAILERS TO MANAGE INVENTORY LEVELS.

EBIT FOR THE NORTH AMERICA GEOGRAPHY DECLINED IN FISCAL 2009 AS A RESULT OF HIGHER OPERATING OVERHEAD EXPENSE AND LOWER GROSS MARGINS.

THE INCREASE IN OPERATING OVERHEAD WAS ATTRIBUTABLE TO INVESTMENTS IN NIKE-OWNED RETAIL. GROSS MARGINS DECREASED AS A RESULT OF HIGHER WAREHOUSING COSTS, HIGHER RETAIL INVENTORY MARKDOWNS AND INCREASED CUSTOMER DISCOUNTS PROVIDED TO MANAGE INVENTORY

LEVELS.

U.K. & IRELAND DECLINED BY 4%, REFLECTING A DIFFICULT RETAIL ENVIRONMENT

32

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THROUGHOUT THE GEOGRAPHY. EXCLUDING CHANGES IN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES, FUTURES ORDERS SCHEDULED FOR DELIVERY DURING THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF FISCAL 2011 WERE 11% HIGHER COMPARED TO THE SAME

PERIOD IN THE PRIOR YEAR, DRIVEN BY STRONG GROWTH ACROSS MOST MARKETS AND PRODUCT CATEGORIES.

EXCLUDING CHANGES IN CURRENCY

EXCHANGE RATES, THE DECREASE IN FOOTWEAR REVENUE DURING FISCAL 2010 WAS PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF LOW SINGLE-DIGIT DECREASES IN BOTH AVERAGE SELLING PRICE AND UNIT SALES. THE DECREASE IN AVERAGE SELLING PRICE WAS ATTRIBUTABLE TO HIGHER CUSTOMER

DISCOUNTS PROVIDED TO MANAGE INVENTORY LEVELS, WHILE THE REDUCTION IN UNIT SALES WAS DUE TO LOWER SALES FOR MOST NIKE BRAND PRODUCT CATEGORIES.

THE YEAR-OVER-YEAR DECREASE IN APPAREL REVENUE WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY A HIGH SINGLE-DIGIT DECLINE IN UNIT SALES COMBINED WITH A MID

SINGLE-DIGIT DECREASE IN AVERAGE SELLING PRICE. THE DECREASE IN UNIT SALES WAS DUE TO LOWER SALES FOR MOST NIKE BRAND PRODUCT CATEGORIES, WHILE THE DECREASE IN AVERAGE SELLING PRICE WAS A RESULT OF HIGHER DISCOUNTS PROVIDED TO RETAILERS TO MANAGE

THEIR INVENTORY LEVELS.

FOR FISCAL 2010, EBIT FOR WESTERN EUROPE DECLINED AT A FASTER RATE THAN REVENUES, AS THE INCREASE IN

SELLING AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE AS A PERCENTAGE OF REVENUES MORE THAN OFFSET THE IMPROVEMENTS IN GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE. THE INCREASE IN SELLING ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY A HIGHER LEVEL OF BOTH DEMAND CREATION SPENDING

AROUND THE 2010 WORLD CUP AND OPERATING OVERHEAD EXPENSE AS A RESULT OF INVESTMENTS IN NIKE-OWNED RETAIL AND HIGHER PERFORMANCE-BASED COMPENSATION. THE GROSS MARGIN IMPROVEMENT IN FISCAL 2010 WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO HIGHER IN-LINE PRODUCT

MARGINS, A SMALLER PROPORTION OF CLOSE-OUT SALES AND REDUCED INVENTORY OBSOLESCENCE EXPENSE AS A RESULT OF OUR LEANER INVENTORY POSITIONS.

FISCAL 2009 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2008

EXCLUDING CHANGES IN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES, A NUMBER OF MARKETS WITHIN THE GEOGRAPHY EXPERIENCED LOWER REVENUES, REFLECTING A MORE

DIFFICULT RETAIL ENVIRONMENT. REVENUES FOR THE SOUTHERN EUROPEAN MARKETS, INCLUDING SPAIN, ITALY AND FRANCE DECLINED, WHILE THE U.K. & IRELAND REMAINED FLAT COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN THE PRIOR YEAR.

THE INCREASE IN FOOTWEAR REVENUE WAS ATTRIBUTABLE TO A LOW SINGLE-DIGIT GROWTH IN UNIT SALES. THE GROWTH IN UNIT SALES WAS DRIVEN

PRIMARILY BY HIGHER DEMAND FOR KIDS AND NIKE BRAND SPORTSWEAR PRODUCTS. AVERAGE SELLING PRICE PER PAIR REMAINED FLAT COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR.

THE DECREASE IN APPAREL REVENUE WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY LOWER AVERAGE SELLING PRICES RESULTING FROM A HIGHER MIX OF CLOSE-OUT SALES AND

HIGHER LEVELS OF DISCOUNTS PROVIDED TO RETAILERS TO MANAGE INVENTORY LEVELS, WHICH MORE THAN OFFSET A LOW-SINGLE-DIGIT INCREASE IN UNIT SALES.

THE YEAR-OVER-YEAR INCREASE IN EBIT FOR THE WESTERN EUROPE GEOGRAPHY DURING FISCAL 2009 WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY A HIGHER GROSS MARGIN

PERCENTAGE, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY SLIGHTLY HIGHER SELLING AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE AS A PERCENTAGE OF REVENUES. THE GROSS MARGIN IMPROVEMENT IN FISCAL 2009 WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO IMPROVED YEAR-OVER-YEAR STANDARD CURRENCY RATES WHICH MORE THAN

OFFSET HIGHER WAREHOUSING COSTS AND DISCOUNTS ON IN-LINE PRODUCTS. THE INCREASE IN SELLING AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE AS A PERCENTAGE OF REVENUES WAS MAINLY DRIVEN BY RETAIL EXPANSION ACROSS THE GEOGRAPHY.

FISCAL 2010 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2009

ECONOMIC CONDITIONS IN CENTRAL AND EASTERN EUROPE REMAINED DIFFICULT AS MOST MARKETS WITHIN THE GEOGRAPHY EXPERIENCED LOWER REVENUES IN

FISCAL 2010 AS COMPARED TO FISCAL 2009. WE ARE BEGINNING TO SEE SIGNS OF STABILIZATION IN THESE MARKETS AS A RESULT OF IMPROVING MACROECONOMIC CONDITIONS, INCREASING BRAND MOMENTUM, AND TIGHT MANAGEMENT OF INVENTORY. ON A CURRENCY-NEUTRAL BASIS,

FUTURE ORDERS SCHEDULED TO BE DELIVERED DURING THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF FISCAL 2011 WERE 3% HIGHER COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN THE PRIOR YEAR.

THE DECREASE IN FOOTWEAR REVENUE WAS DUE TO A DECLINE IN AVERAGE SELLING PRICE, WHILE UNIT SALES REMAINED FLAT COMPARED TO FISCAL 2009.

THE DECLINE IN AVERAGE SELLING PRICE WAS PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF HIGHER DISCOUNTS PROVIDED TO RETAILERS TO MANAGE THEIR INVENTORY LEVELS.

THE YEAR-OVER-YEAR DECREASE IN APPAREL REVENUE WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY A DOUBLE-DIGIT DECREASE IN AVERAGE SELLING PRICE AND A MID

SINGLE-DIGIT DECLINE IN UNIT SALES. THE DECLINE IN AVERAGE SELLING PRICE WAS PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF HIGHER DISCOUNTS PROVIDED TO RETAILERS TO MANAGE THEIR INVENTORY LEVELS, WHILE THE DECLINE IN UNIT SALES WAS DUE TO LOWER SALES IN MOST KEY PRODUCT

CATEGORIES.

THE YEAR-OVER-YEAR DECREASE IN CENTRAL AND EASTERN EUROPES EBIT DURING FISCAL 2010 WAS THE RESULT OF LOWER

REVENUES, A DECLINE IN GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE AND HIGHER SELLING AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE. THE DECLINE IN GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO LESS FAVORABLE YEAR-OVER-YEAR STANDARD CURRENCY RATES, AS WELL AS HIGHER DISCOUNTS

PROVIDED TO CUSTOMERS. THE INCREASE IN SELLING AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO AN INCREASE IN THE RESERVE FOR BAD DEBTS ALONG WITH INCREASED INVESTMENTS IN NIKE-OWNED RETAIL.

FISCAL 2009 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2008

ON A CURRENCY NEUTRAL BASIS, REVENUE FOR THE CENTRAL AND EASTERN EUROPE GEOGRAPHY GREW BY APPROXIMATELY 9 PERCENTAGE POINTS IN FISCAL

2009, DRIVEN BY STRONGER RESULTS IN RUSSIA.

THE INCREASE IN FOOTWEAR REVENUE WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO A DOUBLE-DIGIT

GROWTH IN UNIT SALES. THE GROWTH IN UNIT SALES WAS DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY HIGHER DEMAND FOR NIKE BRAND SPORTSWEAR, KIDS, AND RUNNING PRODUCTS.

THE INCREASE IN APPAREL REVENUES WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY A DOUBLE DIGIT PERCENTAGE INCREASE IN UNIT SALES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A

MID-SINGLE DIGIT DECREASE IN AVERAGE SELLING PRICE, RESULTING FROM A HIGHER MIX OF CLOSE-OUT SALES.

FISCAL 2010 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2009

FOR FISCAL 2010, REVENUES FOR GREATER CHINA WERE FLAT, PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO COMPARISONS AGAINST STRONG REVENUE GROWTH IN THE FIRST

HALF OF FISCAL 2009 DRIVEN BY THE BEIJING OLYMPICS. GREATER CHINA BEGAN TO GAIN MOMENTUM IN THE SECOND HALF OF FISCAL 2010, AS REVENUES INCREASED 11% AS COMPARED TO THE SECOND HALF OF FISCAL 2009. ON A CURRENCY-NEUTRAL BASIS, FUTURES ORDERS

SCHEDULED TO BE DELIVERED DURING THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF FISCAL 2011 WERE 16% HIGHER COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN THE PRIOR YEAR.

THE INCREASE IN FOOTWEAR REVENUE WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY A MID SINGLE-DIGIT INCREASE IN AVERAGE SELLING PRICE, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A MID

SINGLE-DIGIT DECREASE IN UNIT SALES. THE INCREASE IN AVERAGE SELLING PRICE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO STRATEGIC PRODUCT PRICING INCREASES, WHILE THE DECREASE IN UNIT SALES WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY LOWER DISCOUNTS ON IN-LINE PRODUCTS COMPARED TO THE PRIOR

YEAR.

THE DECREASE IN APPAREL REVENUE FOR FISCAL 2010 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO A MID SINGLE-DIGIT DECREASE IN UNIT SALES ACROSS

MOST MAJOR CATEGORIES, WHICH MORE THAN OFFSET A LOW SINGLE-DIGIT INCREASE IN AVERAGE SELLING PRICE PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY STRATEGIC PRODUCT PRICING INCREASES.

EBIT FOR GREATER CHINA INCREASED AT A FASTER RATE THAN REVENUE AS A RESULT OF HIGHER GROSS MARGINS AND REDUCTIONS IN DEMAND CREATION

SPENDING ATTRIBUTABLE TO COMPARISONS AGAINST HIGHER PRIOR YEAR SPENDING AROUND THE BEIJING OLYMPICS.

FISCAL 2009 COMPARED

TO FISCAL 2008

GREATER CHINA CONTINUED TO DELIVER STRONG RESULTS IN FISCAL 2009 AS REVENUES INCREASED 21% ON A

CURRENCY-NEUTRAL BASIS, DRIVEN BY EXPANSION IN BOTH THE NUMBER OF STORES SELLING NIKE PRODUCTS AND SALES THROUGH EXISTING STORES. CHINAS RATE OF REVENUE GROWTH SLOWED TO 6% ON A CURRENCY NEUTRAL BASIS IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF FISCAL 2009 AS WE

LAPPED VERY STRONG GROWTH IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF FISCAL 2008.

THE INCREASE IN BOTH FOOTWEAR AND APPAREL REVENUES WAS DRIVEN

PRIMARILY BY A DOUBLE-DIGIT INCREASE IN UNIT SALES. THE GROWTH IN UNIT SALES WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A REDUCTION IN AVERAGE SELLING PRICE IN FISCAL 2009, RESULTING PRIMARILY FROM INCREASED DISCOUNTS ON IN-LINE PRODUCTS PROVIDED TO RETAILERS TO

MANAGE INVENTORY LEVELS.

35

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE INCREASE IN EBIT FOR GREATER CHINA FOR FISCAL 2009 WAS DRIVEN BY HIGHER REVENUES, WHICH

MORE THAN OFFSET HIGHER SELLING AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE. SELLING AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE INCREASED, BUT REPRESENTED A LOWER PERCENTAGE OF REVENUES FOR FISCAL 2009. THE INCREASE IN SELLING AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE DURING FISCAL 2009 WAS

PRIMARILY DUE TO RETAIL AND INFRASTRUCTURE EXPANSION AND SPENDING AROUND BRAND EVENTS.

FISCAL 2010 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2009

EXCLUDING CHANGES IN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES, BOTH FOOTWEAR AND APPAREL REVENUES IN JAPAN DECLINED DURING FISCAL 2010 DUE TO DECREASES IN

UNIT SALES ACROSS MOST MAJOR CATEGORIES. THE DECLINE IN REVENUES WAS REFLECTIVE OF A DIFFICULT AND HIGHLY PROMOTIONAL MARKETPLACE IN JAPAN. AS WE ENTER FISCAL 2011, WE ANTICIPATE MACROECONOMIC CONDITIONS IN JAPAN TO REMAIN DIFFICULT. ON A

CURRENCY-NEUTRAL BASIS, FUTURES ORDERS SCHEDULED TO BE DELIVERED DURING THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF FISCAL 2011 WERE 16% LOWER COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN THE PRIOR YEAR.

FOR FISCAL 2010, THE DECREASE IN JAPANS EBIT WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER REVENUES AND HIGHER SELLING AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE,

DRIVEN BY INCREASED INVESTMENTS IN NIKE-OWNED RETAIL, WHICH MORE THAN OFFSET IMPROVED GROSS MARGINS.

FISCAL 2009 COMPARED

TO FISCAL 2008

FOR FISCAL 2009, THE INCREASE IN JAPANS FOOTWEAR REVENUE WAS DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY A MID-SINGLE DIGIT

INCREASE IN UNIT SALES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A REDUCTION IN AVERAGE SELLING PRICE. THE SLIGHT INCREASE IN APPAREL REVENUE WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY A LOW-SINGLE DIGIT INCREASE IN AVERAGE SELLING PRICE, WHILE UNIT SALES REMAINED FLAT COMPARED TO FISCAL

2008.

THE INCREASE IN EBIT FOR FISCAL 2009 WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY HIGHER REVENUES AND LOWER SELLING AND ADMINISTRATIVE

EXPENSE AS A PERCENTAGE OF REVENUE COMPARED TO FISCAL 2008.

FISCAL 2010 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2009

EXCLUDING CHANGES IN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES, ALL MARKETS IN THE EMERGING MARKETS GEOGRAPHY REPORTED REVENUE GROWTH FOR FISCAL 2010, MOST

NOTABLY BRAZIL, MEXICO AND KOREA, DRIVEN BY SALES GROWTH IN ALL PRODUCT CATEGORIES. FUTURES ORDERS SCHEDULED TO BE DELIVERED DURING THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF FISCAL 2011 INCREASED 30% ON A CURRENCY NEUTRAL BASIS.

FOOTWEAR REVENUE GROWTH WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY A DOUBLE-DIGIT GROWTH IN UNIT SALES AND A MID SINGLE-DIGIT INCREASE IN AVERAGE SELLING

PRICE PER PAIR DURING FISCAL 2010, REFLECTIVE OF STRONG DEMAND FOR MOST NIKE BRAND PRODUCT CATEGORIES IN ALL MARKETS WITHIN THE GEOGRAPHY.

FOR FISCAL 2010, THE INCREASE IN EMERGING MARKETS EBIT WAS PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF REVENUE GROWTH COMBINED WITH LOWER SELLING AND

ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE, WHICH MORE THAN OFFSET A DECREASE IN GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE. THE DECREASE IN SELLING AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER OPERATING OVERHEAD EXPENSE RESULTING FROM FISCAL 2009 RESTRUCTURING ACTIVITIES. THE

DECLINE IN GROSS MARGIN WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO LESS FAVORABLE YEAR-OVER-YEAR STANDARD CURRENCY RATES ASSIGNED TO THE GEOGRAPHY, WHICH MORE THAN OFFSET IMPROVED IN-LINE PRODUCT MARGINS.

FISCAL 2009 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2008

EXCLUDING CHANGES IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES, MOST MARKETS IN THE EMERGING MARKETS GEOGRAPHY REPORTED REVENUE GROWTH IN FISCAL

2009, LED BY BRAZIL, ARGENTINA AND MEXICO.

THE INCREASE IN FOOTWEAR REVENUE WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY A DOUBLE-DIGIT INCREASE

IN UNIT SALES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A LOW-SINGLE DIGIT REDUCTION IN AVERAGE SELLING PRICE.

THE INCREASE IN EBIT FOR FISCAL

2009 WAS PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF REVENUE GROWTH AND LOWER SELLING AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE. THE DECREASE IN SELLING AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE WAS MAINLY DRIVEN BY A REDUCTION IN SPENDING AROUND ADVERTISING AND SPORTS MARKETING.

FISCAL 2010 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2009

FOR FISCAL 2010, THE INCREASE IN GLOBAL BRAND DIVISIONS LOSS BEFORE INTEREST AND TAXES WAS LARGELY DUE TO INCREASES IN CENTRALLY

MANAGED DEMAND CREATION EXPENSE AND PERFORMANCE-BASED COMPENSATION, WHICH MORE THAN OFFSET AN INCREASE IN LICENSING REVENUES. THE INCREASE IN DEMAND CREATION EXPENSE WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY THE CENTRALIZATION OF CERTAIN MARKETING PRODUCTION COSTS.

FISCAL 2009 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2008

THE INCREASE IN GLOBAL BRAND DIVISIONS LOSS BEFORE INTEREST AND TAXES WAS MAINLY ATTRIBUTABLE TO A DECREASE IN LICENSING REVENUES

AND AN INCREASE IN SELLING AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE DRIVEN BY HIGHER OPERATING OVERHEAD AND INCREASED DEMAND CREATION SPENDING.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

FISCAL 2010 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2009

OUR OTHER BUSINESSES ARE COMPRISED OF COLE HAAN, CONVERSE, HURLEY, NIKE GOLF AND UMBRO. FOR FISCAL 2010, THE INCREASE IN OTHER

BUSINESSES REVENUE WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY REVENUE GROWTH AT CONVERSE, UMBRO AND HURLEY, WHICH MORE THAN OFFSET THE DECLINES AT NIKE GOLF AND COLE HAAN DUE TO REDUCTIONS IN CONSUMER DISCRETIONARY SPENDING IN THEIR RESPECTIVE MARKETS.

IN FISCAL 2009, EBIT FOR OUR OTHER BUSINESSES INCLUDED A $401 MILLION PRE-TAX NON-CASH CHARGE RELATING TO THE IMPAIRMENT OF

GOODWILL, INTANGIBLE AND OTHER ASSETS OF UMBRO. EXCLUDING THIS IMPAIRMENT CHARGE, EBIT FOR OUR OTHER BUSINESSES WOULD HAVE INCREASED 43%, AS A RESULT OF HIGHER REVENUES, IMPROVED GROSS MARGINS ACROSS MOST BUSINESSES, AND LOWER DEMAND CREATION

SPENDING.

FISCAL 2009 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2008

FOR FISCAL 2009, OUR OTHER BUSINESSES WERE COMPRISED OF COLE HAAN, CONVERSE, HURLEY, NIKE GOLF AND UMBRO. FOR FISCAL 2008, OUR OTHER

BUSINESSES PRIMARILY INCLUDED COLE HAAN, CONVERSE, EXETER (WHOSE PRIMARY BUSINESS WAS THE STARTER BRAND BUSINESS WHICH WAS SOLD ON DECEMBER 17, 2007), HURLEY, NIKE BAUER HOCKEY (WHICH WAS SOLD ON APRIL 17, 2008), NIKE GOLF AND UMBRO

(WHICH WAS ACQUIRED ON MARCH 3, 2008).

EXCLUDING THE LOSS OF REVENUE FROM NIKE BAUER HOCKEY AND THE STARTER BRAND

BUSINESS AND THE ADDITION OF UMBRO, OTHER BUSINESSES REVENUES FOR FISCAL 2009 WOULD HAVE INCREASED 6%, DRIVEN BY THE STRONG PERFORMANCE FROM CONVERSE AND HURLEY, OFFSET BY SALES DECREASES AT NIKE GOLF AND COLE HAAN, DUE TO REDUCTIONS IN CONSUMER

DISCRETIONARY SPENDING IN THEIR RESPECTIVE MARKETS.

EBIT FOR OTHER BUSINESSES DECLINED FOR FISCAL 2009 PRIMARILY AS A RESULT

OF A $401 MILLION PRE-TAX NON-CASH IMPAIRMENT CHARGE TO REDUCE THE CARRYING VALUE OF UMBROS GOODWILL INTANGIBLE AND OTHER ASSETS. EXCLUDING THE IMPAIRMENT CHARGE, THE LOSS OF INCOME FROM NIKE BAUER HOCKEY AND THE STARTER BRAND BUSINESS ALONG

WITH THE DILUTIVE IMPACT OF UMBRO, EARNINGS BEFORE INTEREST AND TAXES FOR OTHER BUSINESSES WOULD HAVE DECREASED BY 28%, DRIVEN BY DECLINES IN OPERATING RESULTS AT NIKE GOLF AND COLE HAAN.

CERTAIN HEDGE GAINS AND LOSSES, CORPORATE ELIMINATIONS AND OTHER ITEMS. IN ADDITION TO THE FOREIGN CURRENCY GAINS AND LOSSES RECOGNIZED IN CORPORATE REVENUES, FOREIGN CURRENCY RESULTS INCLUDE ALL OTHER FOREIGN CURRENCY HEDGE RESULTS GENERATED

2010, ALL FOREIGN CURRENCY RESULTS, INCLUDING HEDGE RESULTS AND OTHER CONVERSION GAINS AND LOSSES, GENERATED BY THE WESTERN EUROPE AND CENTRAL AND EASTERN EUROPE GEOGRAPHIES WERE RECORDED IN THEIR RESPECTIVE GEOGRAPHIC RESULTS.

FISCAL 2010 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2009

IN FISCAL 2009, RESULTS FOR CORPORATE INCLUDED A PRE-TAX RESTRUCTURING CHARGE OF $195 MILLION. EXCLUDING THIS RESTRUCTURING CHARGE, LOSS

BEFORE INTEREST AND TAXES FOR CORPORATE WOULD HAVE INCREASED BY 18%, PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY AN INCREASE IN PERFORMANCE-BASED COMPENSATION.

FISCAL 2009 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2008

THE INCREASE IN CORPORATES LOSS BEFORE INTEREST AND TAXES IN FISCAL 2009 WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO PRE-TAX RESTRUCTURING CHARGES

OF $195 MILLION, CONSISTING PRIMARILY OF CASH CHARGES RELATED TO SEVERANCE COSTS.

IN FISCAL 2009, FOREIGN CURRENCY CONVERSION

GAINS (LOSSES) REPORTED IN CORPORATE EXPENSE TOTALED $46 MILLION COMPARED TO ($76) MILLION IN FISCAL 2008, WHICH WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY A NET GAIN FROM CURRENCY HEDGES IN FISCAL 2009 VERSUS A NET HEDGE LOSS IN FISCAL 2008.

FOREIGN CURRENCY EXPOSURES AND HEDGING PRACTICES

OVERVIEW

AS A GLOBAL COMPANY WITH SIGNIFICANT OPERATIONS OUTSIDE THE U.S. WE ARE EXPOSED TO RISK ARISING FROM CHANGES IN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES IN

THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS. FOREIGN CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS AFFECT THE RECORDING OF TRANSACTIONS, SUCH AS SALES, PURCHASES AND INTERCOMPANY TRANSACTIONS DENOMINATED IN NON-FUNCTIONAL CURRENCIES AND THE TRANSLATION OF FOREIGN CURRENCY DENOMINATED

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL POSITION AND CASH FLOWS INTO U.S. DOLLARS FOR CONSOLIDATED REPORTING. OUR PRIMARY FOREIGN CURRENCY EXPOSURES ARE RELATED TO U.S. DOLLAR TRANSACTIONS AT WHOLLY-OWNED FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES, AS WELL AS TRANSACTIONS AND

TRANSLATION OF RESULTS DENOMINATED IN EUROS, BRITISH POUNDS, CHINESE RENMINBI AND JAPANESE YEN.

OUR FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK

MANAGEMENT PROGRAM IS INTENDED TO MINIMIZE BOTH THE POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE EFFECTS OF CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS ON OUR REPORTED CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL POSITION AND CASH FLOWS. THIS ALSO HAS THE EFFECT OF DELAYING THE IMPACT OF

CURRENT MARKET RATES ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, DEPENDENT UPON HEDGE HORIZONS. WE MANAGE GLOBAL FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK CENTRALLY, ON A PORTFOLIO BASIS, TO MANAGE THOSE RISKS THAT ARE MATERIAL TO NIKE, INC. ON A CONSOLIDATED BASIS. WE

MANAGE THESE EXPOSURES BY TAKING ADVANTAGE OF NATURAL OFFSETS AND CURRENCY CORRELATIONS THAT EXIST WITHIN THE PORTFOLIO AND BY HEDGING REMAINING MATERIAL EXPOSURES, WHERE PRACTICAL, USING DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS SUCH AS FORWARD CONTRACTS AND OPTIONS.

THE COMPANYS HEDGING POLICY IS DESIGNED TO PARTIALLY OR ENTIRELY OFFSET CHANGES IN THE UNDERLYING EXPOSURES BEING HEDGED. WE DO NOT HOLD OR ISSUE DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS FOR SPECULATIVE TRADING PURPOSES.

TRANSACTIONAL EXPOSURES

WE TRANSACT BUSINESS IN VARIOUS CURRENCIES AND HAVE SIGNIFICANT REVENUES AND COSTS DENOMINATED IN CURRENCIES OTHER THAN THE FUNCTIONAL

CURRENCY OF THE RELEVANT SUBSIDIARY, WHICH SUBJECTS US TO FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK. OUR MOST SIGNIFICANT TRANSACTIONAL FOREIGN CURRENCY EXPOSURES ARE.

1.

INVENTORY PURCHASES  MOST OF OUR INVENTORY PURCHASES AROUND THE WORLD ARE DENOMINATED IN U.S. DOLLARS. THIS GENERATES FOREIGN CURRENCY EXPOSURES FOR ALL

SUBSIDIARIES WITH A FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY OTHER THAN THE U.S. DOLLAR. A WEAKER U.S. DOLLAR REDUCES THE INVENTORY COST IN THE PURCHASING SUBSIDIARYS FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY WHEREAS A STRONGER U.S. DOLLAR INCREASES THE INVENTORY COST.

40

TABLE OF CONTENTS

2.

NON-FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY REVENUES  A PORTION OF OUR WESTERN EUROPE GEOGRAPHY REVENUES ARE EARNED IN CURRENCIES OTHER THAN THE EURO (E.G. BRITISH POUND), BUT ARE

RECOGNIZED AT A SUBSIDIARY THAT USES THE EURO AS ITS FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY, GENERATING FOREIGN CURRENCY EXPOSURE.

3.

OTHER REVENUES AND COSTS  NON-FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY REVENUES AND COSTS, SUCH AS ENDORSEMENT CONTRACTS, INTERCOMPANY ROYALTIES AND OTHER PAYMENTS, GENERATE FOREIGN

CURRENCY RISK TO A LESSER EXTENT.

4.

NON-FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY ASSETS AND LIABILITIES  OUR GLOBAL SUBSIDIARIES HAVE VARIOUS ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, PRIMARILY RECEIVABLES AND PAYABLES, THAT ARE

DENOMINATED IN CURRENCIES OTHER THAN THEIR FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY. THESE BALANCE SHEET ITEMS ARE SUBJECT TO REMEASUREMENT WHICH MAY CREATE FLUCTUATIONS IN OTHER (INCOME) EXPENSE, NET WITHIN OUR CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

MANAGING TRANSACTIONAL EXPOSURES

TRANSACTIONAL EXPOSURES ARE MANAGED ON A PORTFOLIO BASIS WITHIN OUR FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK MANAGEMENT PROGRAM. AS OF MAY 31, 2010, WE

USE CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS AND OPTIONS WITH MATURITIES UP TO 18 MONTHS TO HEDGE THE EFFECT OF EXCHANGE RATE FLUCTUATIONS ON PROBABLE FORECASTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS, INCLUDING NON-FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY REVENUES AND EXPENSES. THESE ARE ACCOUNTED FOR

AS CASH FLOW HEDGES IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE ACCOUNTING STANDARDS FOR DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING. THE FAIR VALUE OF THESE INSTRUMENTS AT MAY 31, 2010 AND 2009 WAS $206 MILLION AND $248 MILLION IN ASSETS AND $25 MILLION AND $12 MILLION IN

LIABILITIES, RESPECTIVELY. THE EFFECTIVE PORTION OF THE CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE OF THESE INSTRUMENTS IS REPORTED IN OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (OCI), A COMPONENT OF SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY, AND RECLASSIFIED INTO EARNINGS IN THE SAME

FINANCIAL STATEMENT LINE ITEM AND IN THE SAME PERIOD OR PERIODS DURING WHICH THE RELATED HEDGED TRANSACTIONS AFFECT EARNINGS. THE INEFFECTIVE PORTION WAS A GAIN OF $5 MILLION FOR THE YEAR ENDED MAY 31, 2010. THE INEFFECTIVE PORTION WAS

IMMEDIATELY RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS AS A COMPONENT OF OTHER (INCOME) EXPENSE, NET. INEFFECTIVENESS WAS NOT MATERIAL FOR THE YEARS ENDED MAY 31, 2010, 2009 AND 2008.

CERTAIN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS USED TO MANAGE FOREIGN EXCHANGE EXPOSURE OF NON-FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY ASSETS AND LIABILITIES SUBJECT TO

REMEASUREMENT ARE NOT DESIGNATED AS HEDGES UNDER THE ACCOUNTING STANDARDS FOR DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING. IN THESE CASES, THE CHANGE IN VALUE OF THE INSTRUMENTS IS INTENDED TO OFFSET THE FOREIGN CURRENCY IMPACT OF THE REMEASUREMENT OF THE RELATED

NON-FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY ASSET OR LIABILITY. THE FAIR VALUE OF THESE INSTRUMENTS AT MAY 31, 2010 AND 2009 WAS $104 MILLION AND $13 MILLION IN ASSETS AND $140 MILLION AND $34 MILLION IN LIABILITIES, RESPECTIVELY. THE CHANGE IN VALUE OF THESE

INSTRUMENTS IS IMMEDIATELY RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS. THE IMPACT OF SUCH INSTRUMENTS IS INCLUDED IN OTHER (INCOME) EXPENSE, NET AND AIMS TO OFFSET FOREIGN CURRENCY REMEASUREMENT GAINS AND LOSSES OF THE EXPOSURES BEING HEDGED.

REFER TO NOTE 18  RISK MANAGEMENT AND DERIVATIVES IN THE ACCOMPANYING NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR ADDITIONAL

QUANTITATIVE DETAIL.

TRANSLATIONAL EXPOSURES

SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES OPERATE IN FUNCTIONAL CURRENCIES OTHER THAN THE U.S. DOLLAR. FLUCTUATIONS IN CURRENCY

EXCHANGE RATES CREATE VOLATILITY IN OUR REPORTED RESULTS AS WE ARE REQUIRED TO TRANSLATE THE BALANCE SHEETS AND OPERATIONAL RESULTS OF THESE FOREIGN CURRENCY DENOMINATED SUBSIDIARIES INTO U.S. DOLLARS FOR CONSOLIDATED REPORTING. THE TRANSLATION OF

FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES NON-U.S. DOLLAR BALANCE SHEETS INTO U.S. DOLLARS FOR CONSOLIDATED REPORTING RESULTS IN A CUMULATIVE TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENT TO OCI WITHIN SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY. IN PREPARING OUR CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME, FOREIGN

EXCHANGE RATE FLUCTUATIONS IMPACT OUR OPERATING RESULTS AS THE REVENUES AND EXPENSES OF OUR FOREIGN OPERATIONS ARE TRANSLATED INTO U.S. DOLLARS. IN TRANSLATION, A WEAKER U.S. DOLLAR IN RELATION TO FOREIGN FUNCTIONAL CURRENCIES BENEFITS OUR

CONSOLIDATED EARNINGS WHEREAS A STRONGER U.S. DOLLAR REDUCES OUR CONSOLIDATED EARNINGS. THE IMPACT OF FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATE FLUCTUATIONS ON THE TRANSLATION OF OUR CONSOLIDATED REVENUES AND INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES WAS A NET TRANSLATION

BENEFIT (DETRIMENT) OF APPROXIMATELY $147 MILLION AND $33 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, FOR THE YEAR ENDED MAY 31, 2010 AND APPROXIMATELY ($199) MILLION AND $4 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, FOR THE YEAR ENDED MAY 31, 2009.

41

TABLE OF CONTENTS

MANAGING TRANSLATIONAL EXPOSURES

TO MINIMIZE THE IMPACT OF TRANSLATING FOREIGN CURRENCY DENOMINATED REVENUES AND EXPENSES INTO U.S. DOLLARS FOR CONSOLIDATED REPORTING,

CERTAIN FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES USE EXCESS CASH TO PURCHASE U.S. DOLLAR DENOMINATED AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE INVESTMENTS. THE VARIABLE FUTURE CASH FLOWS ASSOCIATED WITH THE PURCHASE AND SUBSEQUENT SALE OF THESE U.S. DOLLAR DENOMINATED SECURITIES AT NON-U.S.

DOLLAR FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY SUBSIDIARIES CREATES A FOREIGN CURRENCY EXPOSURE THAT QUALIFIES FOR HEDGE ACCOUNTING UNDER THE ACCOUNTING STANDARDS FOR DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING. WE UTILIZE FORWARD CONTRACTS AND OPTIONS TO PARTIALLY, OR ENTIRELY, HEDGE THE

VARIABILITY OF THE FORECASTED FUTURE PURCHASES AND SALES OF THESE U.S. DOLLAR INVESTMENTS. THIS HAS THE EFFECT OF PARTIALLY OFFSETTING THE YEAR-OVER-YEAR FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION IMPACT ON NET EARNINGS IN THE PERIOD THE INVESTMENTS ARE SOLD.

HEDGES OF AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE INVESTMENTS ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AS CASH FLOW HEDGES. THE FAIR VALUE OF INSTRUMENTS USED IN THIS MANNER AT MAY 31, 2010 AND 2009 WAS $78 MILLION AND $104 MILLION IN ASSETS, RESPECTIVELY. THERE WERE NO INSTRUMENTS IN A

LIABILITY POSITION AT MAY 31, 2010 OR 2009. THE EFFECTIVE PORTION OF THE CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE OF THESE INSTRUMENTS IS REPORTED IN OCI AND RECLASSIFIED INTO EARNINGS IN OTHER (INCOME) EXPENSE, NET IN THE PERIOD DURING WHICH THE HEDGED

AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE INVESTMENT IS SOLD AND AFFECTS EARNINGS. ANY INEFFECTIVE PORTION, WHICH WAS NOT MATERIAL FOR ANY PERIOD PRESENTED, IS IMMEDIATELY RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS AS A COMPONENT OF OTHER (INCOME) EXPENSE, NET.

WE ESTIMATE THAT THE COMBINATION OF TRANSLATION OF FOREIGN CURRENCY-DENOMINATED PROFITS FROM OUR INTERNATIONAL BUSINESSES AND THE

YEAR-OVER-YEAR CHANGE IN FOREIGN CURRENCY RELATED GAINS INCLUDED IN OTHER (INCOME) EXPENSE, NET HAD A FAVORABLE IMPACT OF APPROXIMATELY $34 MILLION AND $124 MILLION ON OUR INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES FOR FISCAL 2010 AND 2009, RESPECTIVELY.

REFER TO NOTE 18  RISK MANAGEMENT AND DERIVATIVES IN THE ACCOMPANYING NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

FOR ADDITIONAL QUANTITATIVE DETAIL.

NET INVESTMENTS IN FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES

WE ARE ALSO EXPOSED TO THE IMPACT OF FOREIGN EXCHANGE FLUCTUATIONS ON OUR INVESTMENTS IN WHOLLY-OWNED FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES DENOMINATED IN

A CURRENCY OTHER THAN THE U.S. DOLLAR, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT THE U.S. DOLLAR VALUE OF THESE INVESTMENTS AND THEREFORE THE VALUE OF FUTURE REPATRIATED EARNINGS. DURING FISCAL 2008, WE BEGAN TO HEDGE CERTAIN NET INVESTMENT POSITIONS IN

EURO-FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES TO MITIGATE THE EFFECTS OF FOREIGN EXCHANGE FLUCTUATIONS ON NET INVESTMENTS WITH THE EFFECT OF PRESERVING THE VALUE OF FUTURE REPATRIATED EARNINGS. IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE ACCOUNTING STANDARDS FOR

DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING, THE EFFECTIVE PORTION OF THE CHANGE IN FAIR VALUE OF THE FORWARD CONTRACTS DESIGNATED AS NET INVESTMENT HEDGES IS RECORDED IN THE CUMULATIVE TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENT COMPONENT OF ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME. ANY

INEFFECTIVE PORTION, WHICH WAS NOT MATERIAL FOR ANY PERIOD PRESENTED, IS IMMEDIATELY RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS AS A COMPONENT OF OTHER (INCOME) EXPENSE, NET. TO MINIMIZE CREDIT RISK, WE HAVE STRUCTURED THESE NET INVESTMENT HEDGES TO BE GENERALLY LESS

THAN SIX MONTHS IN DURATION. UPON MATURITY, THE HEDGES ARE SETTLED BASED ON THE CURRENT FAIR VALUE OF THE FORWARD CONTRACTS WITH THE REALIZED GAIN OR LOSS REMAINING IN OCI; CONCURRENT WITH SETTLEMENT, WE ENTER INTO NEW FORWARD CONTRACTS AT THE

CURRENT MARKET RATE. THE FAIR VALUE OF OUTSTANDING NET INVESTMENT HEDGES AT MAY 31, 2010 AND 2009 WERE $32 MILLION IN ASSETS AND $23 MILLION IN LIABILITIES, RESPECTIVELY. CASH FLOWS FROM NET INVESTMENT HEDGE SETTLEMENTS TOTALED $5 MILLION AND

$191 MILLION IN THE YEARS ENDED MAY 31, 2010 AND 2009, RESPECTIVELY.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

CASH FLOW ACTIVITY

CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATIONS WAS $3.2 BILLION FOR FISCAL 2010 COMPARED TO $1.7 BILLION FOR FISCAL 2009. OUR PRIMARY SOURCE OF OPERATING

CASH FLOW FOR FISCAL 2010 WAS NET INCOME OF $1.9 BILLION AS WELL AS POSITIVE CASH FLOWS FROM WORKING CAPITAL. OUR WORKING CAPITAL PROVIDED A NET POSITIVE CASH FLOW OF $0.7 BILLION FOR FISCAL 2010 AS COMPARED TO A NET CASH OUTFLOW OF $0.4 BILLION FOR

FISCAL 2009. THE INCREASE IN CASH FLOWS FROM WORKING CAPITAL

42

TABLE OF CONTENTS

WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO AN INCREASE IN ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND ACCRUED LIABILITIES, DRIVEN BY TIMING OF FOURTH QUARTER EXPENSES, A DECREASE IN ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AS A RESULT OF A SHORTER COLLECTION

CYCLE AND SLIGHTLY LOWER REVENUES, AND A DECREASE IN INVENTORIES, REFLECTIVE OF TIGHTER INVENTORY BUYS COMPARED TO FISCAL 2009.

CASH USED BY INVESTING ACTIVITIES WAS $1.3 BILLION DURING FISCAL 2010, COMPARED TO $0.8 BILLION FOR FISCAL 2009. THE YEAR-OVER-YEAR

INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO NET PURCHASES OF SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS OF $0.9 BILLION (NET OF SALES AND MATURITIES) IN FISCAL 2010 COMPARED TO $0.5 BILLION IN NET PURCHASES OF SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS DURING FISCAL 2009. ALSO CONTRIBUTING TO THE

YEAR-OVER-YEAR INCREASE IN CASH USED BY INVESTING ACTIVITIES IN FISCAL 2010 WAS A REDUCTION IN PROCEEDS FOR THE SETTLEMENT OF NET INVESTMENT HEDGES COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD. THESE INCREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A REDUCTION IN CASH USED

FOR PURCHASES OF PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT.

CASH USED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES WAS $1.1 BILLION FOR FISCAL 2010 COMPARED

TO $0.7 BILLION USED IN FISCAL 2009. THE INCREASE IN CASH USED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO AN INCREASE IN PAYMENTS OF NOTES PAYABLE AND LONG-TERM DEBT AS WELL AS AN INCREASE IN SHARE REPURCHASES AND DIVIDENDS PAID, PARTIALLY

OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN PROCEEDS FROM EXERCISE OF STOCK OPTIONS.

IN FISCAL 2010, WE PURCHASED 11.3 MILLION SHARES OF

NIKES CLASS B COMMON STOCK FOR $754 MILLION. DURING FISCAL 2010, WE CONCLUDED OUR PREVIOUS FOUR-YEAR, $3 BILLION SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM THAT WAS APPROVED BY THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS IN JUNE 2006. DURING THIS PROGRAM, WE REPURCHASED A TOTAL OF

53.9 MILLION SHARES. HAVING COMPLETED THE PROGRAM, DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2010, WE BEGAN REPURCHASES UNDER THE FOUR-YEAR $5 BILLION PROGRAM APPROVED BY OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS IN SEPTEMBER 2008. OF THE TOTAL 11 MILLION

SHARES REPURCHASED DURING FISCAL 2010, 6.6 MILLION SHARES WERE REPURCHASED UNDER THIS PROGRAM FOR $454 MILLION. WE CONTINUE TO EXPECT FUNDING OF SHARE REPURCHASES WILL COME FROM OPERATING CASH FLOW, EXCESS CASH, AND/OR DEBT. THE TIMING AND THE

AMOUNT OF SHARES PURCHASED WILL BE DICTATED BY OUR CAPITAL NEEDS AND STOCK MARKET CONDITIONS.

ARRANGEMENTS

IN CONNECTION WITH VARIOUS CONTRACTS AND AGREEMENTS, WE PROVIDE ROUTINE INDEMNIFICATIONS RELATING TO THE

ENFORCEABILITY OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS, COVERAGE FOR LEGAL ISSUES THAT ARISE AND OTHER ITEMS WHERE WE ARE ACTING AS THE GUARANTOR. CURRENTLY, WE HAVE SEVERAL SUCH AGREEMENTS IN PLACE. HOWEVER, BASED ON OUR HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND THE

ESTIMATED PROBABILITY OF FUTURE LOSS, WE HAVE DETERMINED THAT THE FAIR VALUE OF SUCH INDEMNIFICATIONS IS NOT MATERIAL TO OUR FINANCIAL POSITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

WE ALSO HAVE THE FOLLOWING OUTSTANDING SHORT-TERM DEBT OBLIGATIONS AS OF MAY 31, 2010. PLEASE REFER TO THE ACCOMPANYING NOTES TO THE

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (NOTE 7  SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS AND CREDIT LINES) FOR FURTHER DESCRIPTION AND INTEREST RATES RELATED TO THE SHORT-TERM DEBT OBLIGATIONS LISTED BELOW.

CAPITAL RESOURCES

IN DECEMBER 2008, WE FILED A SHELF REGISTRATION STATEMENT WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION UNDER WHICH $760 MILLION

IN DEBT SECURITIES MAY BE ISSUED. AS OF MAY 31, 2010, NO DEBT SECURITIES HAD BEEN ISSUED UNDER THIS SHELF REGISTRATION. WE MAY ISSUE DEBT SECURITIES UNDER THE SHELF REGISTRATION IN FISCAL 2011 DEPENDING ON GENERAL CORPORATE NEEDS.

AS OF MAY 31, 2010, WE HAD NO AMOUNTS OUTSTANDING UNDER OUR MULTI-YEAR, $1 BILLION REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY IN PLACE WITH A GROUP

OF BANKS. THE FACILITY MATURES IN DECEMBER 2012. BASED ON OUR CURRENT LONG-TERM

SENIOR UNSECURED DEBT RATINGS OF A+ AND A1 FROM STANDARD AND POORS CORPORATION AND MOODYS INVESTOR SERVICES, RESPECTIVELY, THE INTEREST RATE CHARGED ON ANY OUTSTANDING BORROWINGS

WOULD BE THE PREVAILING LONDON INTERBANK OFFER RATE (LIBOR) PLUS 0.15%. THE FACILITY FEE IS 0.05% OF THE TOTAL COMMITMENT.

IF OUR LONG-TERM DEBT RATING WERE TO DECLINE, THE FACILITY FEE AND INTEREST RATE UNDER OUR COMMITTED CREDIT FACILITY WOULD INCREASE.

CONVERSELY, IF OUR LONG-TERM DEBT RATING WERE TO IMPROVE, THE FACILITY FEE AND INTEREST RATE WOULD DECREASE. CHANGES IN OUR LONG-TERM DEBT RATING WOULD NOT TRIGGER ACCELERATION OF MATURITY OF ANY THEN OUTSTANDING BORROWINGS OR ANY FUTURE BORROWINGS

UNDER THE COMMITTED CREDIT FACILITY. UNDER THIS COMMITTED CREDIT FACILITY, WE HAVE AGREED TO VARIOUS COVENANTS. THESE COVENANTS INCLUDE LIMITS ON OUR DISPOSAL OF FIXED ASSETS AND THE AMOUNT OF DEBT SECURED BY LIENS WE MAY INCUR AS WELL AS A MINIMUM

CAPITALIZATION RATIO. IN THE EVENT WE WERE TO HAVE ANY BORROWINGS OUTSTANDING UNDER THIS FACILITY, FAILED TO MEET ANY COVENANT, AND WERE UNABLE TO OBTAIN A WAIVER FROM A MAJORITY OF THE BANKS, ANY BORROWINGS WOULD BECOME IMMEDIATELY DUE AND PAYABLE.

AS OF MAY 31, 2010, WE WERE IN FULL COMPLIANCE WITH EACH OF THESE COVENANTS AND BELIEVE IT IS UNLIKELY WE WILL FAIL TO MEET ANY OF THESE COVENANTS IN THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE.

LIQUIDITY IS ALSO PROVIDED BY OUR $1 BILLION COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAM. AS OF MAY 31, 2010, NO AMOUNTS WERE OUTSTANDING UNDER THIS

PROGRAM. WE MAY ISSUE COMMERCIAL PAPER FROM TIME TO TIME DURING FISCAL 2011 DEPENDING ON GENERAL CORPORATE NEEDS. WE CURRENTLY HAVE SHORT-TERM DEBT RATINGS OF A1 AND P1 FROM STANDARD AND POORS CORPORATION AND MOODYS INVESTOR SERVICES,

RESPECTIVELY.

DESPITE RECENT UNCERTAINTIES IN THE FINANCIAL MARKETS, TO DATE WE HAVE NOT EXPERIENCED DIFFICULTY ACCESSING THE

CREDIT MARKETS OR INCURRED HIGHER INTEREST COSTS. FUTURE VOLATILITY IN THE CAPITAL MARKETS, HOWEVER, MAY INCREASE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH ISSUING COMMERCIAL PAPER OR OTHER DEBT INSTRUMENTS OR AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO ACCESS THOSE MARKETS. WE BELIEVE THAT

CURRENT CASH AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENT BALANCES AND CASH GENERATED BY OPERATIONS, TOGETHER WITH ACCESS TO EXTERNAL SOURCES OF FUNDS AS DESCRIBED ABOVE, WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO MEET OUR OPERATING AND CAPITAL NEEDS IN THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE.

RECENTLY ADOPTED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

IN JANUARY 2010, THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD (FASB) ISSUED GUIDANCE TO AMEND THE DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS RELATED

TO RECURRING AND NONRECURRING FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS. THE GUIDANCE REQUIRES ADDITIONAL DISCLOSURES ABOUT THE DIFFERENT CLASSES OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE, THE VALUATION TECHNIQUES AND INPUTS USED, THE ACTIVITY IN LEVEL 3 FAIR

VALUE MEASUREMENTS, AND THE TRANSFERS BETWEEN LEVELS 1, 2, AND 3 OF THE FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT HIERARCHY. THIS GUIDANCE BECAME EFFECTIVE FOR US BEGINNING MARCH 1, 2010, EXCEPT FOR DISCLOSURES RELATING TO PURCHASES, SALES, ISSUANCES AND

SETTLEMENTS OF LEVEL 3 ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, WHICH WILL BE EFFECTIVE FOR US BEGINNING JUNE 1, 2011. AS THIS GUIDANCE ONLY REQUIRES EXPANDED DISCLOSURES, THE ADOPTION DID NOT AND WILL NOT IMPACT OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL POSITION OR

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. SEE NOTE 6  FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS IN THE ACCOMPANYING NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR DISCLOSURES REQUIRED UNDER THIS GUIDANCE.

IN FEBRUARY 2010, THE FASB ISSUED AMENDED GUIDANCE ON SUBSEQUENT EVENTS. UNDER THIS AMENDED GUIDANCE, SEC FILERS ARE NO LONGER REQUIRED

TO DISCLOSE THE DATE THROUGH WHICH SUBSEQUENT EVENTS HAVE BEEN EVALUATED IN ORIGINALLY ISSUED AND REVISED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. THIS GUIDANCE WAS EFFECTIVE IMMEDIATELY AND WE ADOPTED THESE NEW REQUIREMENTS SINCE THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2010.

IN JUNE 2009, THE FASB ESTABLISHED THE FASB ACCOUNTING STANDARDS CODIFICATION (THE CODIFICATION) AS THE SINGLE

SOURCE OF AUTHORITATIVE U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES (GAAP) FOR ALL NON-GOVERNMENTAL ENTITIES. THE CODIFICATION, WHICH LAUNCHED JULY 1, 2009, CHANGES THE REFERENCING AND ORGANIZATION OF ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE. THE

CODIFICATION BECAME EFFECTIVE FOR US BEGINNING SEPTEMBER 1, 2009. THE ISSUANCE OF FASB CODIFICATION DID NOT CHANGE GAAP AND THEREFORE THE ADOPTION HAS ONLY AFFECTED HOW SPECIFIC REFERENCES TO GAAP LITERATURE ARE DISCLOSED IN THE NOTES TO OUR

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

45

TABLE OF CONTENTS

IN APRIL 2009, THE FASB UPDATED GUIDANCE RELATED TO FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS TO CLARIFY THE

GUIDANCE RELATED TO MEASURING FAIR VALUE IN INACTIVE MARKETS, TO MODIFY THE RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT OF OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENTS OF DEBT SECURITIES, AND TO REQUIRE PUBLIC COMPANIES TO DISCLOSE THE FAIR VALUES OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS IN

INTERIM PERIODS. THIS UPDATED GUIDANCE BECAME EFFECTIVE FOR US BEGINNING JUNE 1, 2009. THE ADOPTION OF THIS GUIDANCE DID NOT HAVE AN IMPACT ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL POSITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. SEE NOTE 6  FAIR VALUE

MEASUREMENTS IN THE ACCOMPANYING NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR DISCLOSURES REQUIRED UNDER THE UPDATED GUIDANCE.

IN JUNE 2008, THE FASB ISSUED NEW ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE APPLICABLE WHEN DETERMINING WHETHER INSTRUMENTS GRANTED IN SHARE-BASED PAYMENT

TRANSACTIONS ARE PARTICIPATING SECURITIES. THIS GUIDANCE CLARIFIES THAT SHARE-BASED PAYMENT AWARDS THAT ENTITLE THEIR HOLDERS TO RECEIVE NON-FORFEITABLE DIVIDENDS BEFORE VESTING SHOULD BE CONSIDERED PARTICIPATING SECURITIES AND INCLUDED IN THE

COMPUTATION OF EARNINGS PER SHARE PURSUANT TO THE TWO-CLASS METHOD. THIS GUIDANCE BECAME EFFECTIVE FOR US BEGINNING JUNE 1, 2009. THE ADOPTION OF THIS GUIDANCE DID NOT HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL POSITION, RESULTS

OF OPERATIONS OR EARNINGS PER SHARE.

IN APRIL 2008, THE FASB ISSUED AMENDED GUIDANCE REGARDING THE DETERMINATION OF THE

USEFUL LIFE OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS. THE GUIDANCE AMENDS THE FACTORS THAT SHOULD BE CONSIDERED IN DEVELOPING RENEWAL OR EXTENSION ASSUMPTIONS USED TO DETERMINE THE USEFUL LIFE OF A RECOGNIZED INTANGIBLE ASSET. THE INTENT OF THE POSITION IS TO IMPROVE

THE CONSISTENCY BETWEEN THE USEFUL LIFE OF A RECOGNIZED INTANGIBLE ASSET AND THE PERIOD OF EXPECTED CASH FLOWS USED TO MEASURE THE FAIR VALUE OF THE ASSET. THIS GUIDANCE BECAME EFFECTIVE FOR US BEGINNING JUNE 1, 2009. THE ADOPTION OF THIS

GUIDANCE DID NOT HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL POSITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

IN DECEMBER 2007,

THE FASB ISSUED AMENDED GUIDANCE REGARDING BUSINESS COMBINATIONS, ESTABLISHING PRINCIPLES AND REQUIREMENTS FOR HOW AN ACQUIRER RECOGNIZES AND MEASURES IDENTIFIABLE ASSETS ACQUIRED, LIABILITIES ASSUMED, ANY RESULTING GOODWILL, AND ANY NON-CONTROLLING

INTEREST IN AN ACQUIREE IN ITS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. THIS GUIDANCE ALSO PROVIDES FOR DISCLOSURES TO ENABLE USERS OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS TO EVALUATE THE NATURE AND FINANCIAL EFFECTS OF A BUSINESS COMBINATION. THIS AMENDED GUIDANCE BECAME

EFFECTIVE FOR US BEGINNING JUNE 1, 2009. THE ADOPTION OF THIS AMENDED GUIDANCE DID NOT HAVE AN IMPACT ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, BUT COULD IMPACT THE ACCOUNTING FOR FUTURE BUSINESS COMBINATIONS.

IN DECEMBER 2007, THE FASB ISSUED NEW GUIDANCE REGARDING THE ACCOUNTING AND REPORTING FOR NON-CONTROLLING INTERESTS IN SUBSIDIARIES. THIS

GUIDANCE CLARIFIES THAT NON-CONTROLLING INTERESTS IN SUBSIDIARIES SHOULD BE ACCOUNTED FOR AS A COMPONENT OF EQUITY SEPARATE FROM THE PARENTS EQUITY. THIS GUIDANCE BECAME EFFECTIVE FOR US BEGINNING JUNE 1, 2009. THE ADOPTION OF THIS

GUIDANCE DID NOT HAVE AN IMPACT ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL POSITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

IN OCTOBER 2009, THE FASB ISSUED NEW STANDARDS THAT REVISED THE GUIDANCE FOR REVENUE RECOGNITION WITH MULTIPLE

DELIVERABLES. THESE NEW STANDARDS IMPACT THE DETERMINATION OF WHEN THE INDIVIDUAL DELIVERABLES INCLUDED IN A MULTIPLE-ELEMENT ARRANGEMENT MAY BE TREATED AS SEPARATE UNITS OF ACCOUNTING. ADDITIONALLY, THESE NEW STANDARDS MODIFY THE MANNER IN WHICH

THE TRANSACTION CONSIDERATION IS ALLOCATED ACROSS THE SEPARATELY IDENTIFIED DELIVERABLES BY NO LONGER PERMITTING THE RESIDUAL METHOD OF ALLOCATING ARRANGEMENT CONSIDERATION. THESE NEW STANDARDS ARE EFFECTIVE FOR US BEGINNING JUNE 1, 2011. WE DO

NOT EXPECT THE ADOPTION WILL HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL POSITIONS OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

IN JUNE

2009, THE FASB ISSUED A NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARD THAT REVISED THE GUIDANCE FOR THE CONSOLIDATION OF VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES (VIE). THIS NEW GUIDANCE REQUIRES A QUALITATIVE APPROACH TO IDENTIFYING A CONTROLLING FINANCIAL INTEREST IN A

VIE AND REQUIRES AN ONGOING ASSESSMENT OF WHETHER AN ENTITY IS A VIE AND WHETHER AN INTEREST IN A VIE MAKES THE HOLDER THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY OF THE VIE. THIS GUIDANCE IS EFFECTIVE FOR US BEGINNING JUNE 1, 2010. WE ARE CURRENTLY EVALUATING THE

IMPACT OF THE PROVISIONS OF THIS NEW STANDARD.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

OUR PREVIOUS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS ARE BASED UPON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS, WHICH HAVE BEEN PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. THE PREPARATION OF THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS REQUIRES US TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS THAT AFFECT THE REPORTED

AMOUNTS OF ASSETS, LIABILITIES, REVENUES AND EXPENSES, AND RELATED DISCLOSURE OF CONTINGENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES.

WE

BELIEVE THAT THE ESTIMATES, ASSUMPTIONS AND JUDGMENTS INVOLVED IN THE ACCOUNTING POLICIES DESCRIBED BELOW HAVE THE GREATEST POTENTIAL IMPACT ON OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, SO WE CONSIDER THESE TO BE OUR CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES. BECAUSE OF THE

UNCERTAINTY INHERENT IN THESE MATTERS, ACTUAL RESULTS COULD DIFFER FROM THE ESTIMATES WE USE IN APPLYING THE CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES. CERTAIN OF THESE CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AFFECT WORKING CAPITAL ACCOUNT BALANCES, INCLUDING THE POLICIES

FOR REVENUE RECOGNITION, THE ALLOWANCE FOR UNCOLLECTIBLE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, INVENTORY RESERVES, AND CONTINGENT PAYMENTS UNDER ENDORSEMENT CONTRACTS. THESE POLICIES REQUIRE THAT WE MAKE ESTIMATES IN THE PREPARATION OF OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AS OF

A GIVEN DATE. HOWEVER, SINCE OUR BUSINESS CYCLE IS RELATIVELY SHORT, ACTUAL RESULTS RELATED TO THESE ESTIMATES ARE GENERALLY KNOWN WITHIN THE SIX-MONTH PERIOD FOLLOWING THE FINANCIAL STATEMENT DATE. THUS, THESE POLICIES GENERALLY AFFECT ONLY THE

TIMING OF REPORTED AMOUNTS ACROSS TWO TO THREE FISCAL QUARTERS.

WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF THESE CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES, WE

ARE NOT CURRENTLY AWARE OF ANY REASONABLY LIKELY EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES THAT WOULD RESULT IN MATERIALLY DIFFERENT AMOUNTS BEING REPORTED.

REVENUE RECOGNITION

WE RECORD WHOLESALE REVENUES WHEN TITLE PASSES AND THE RISKS AND REWARDS OF OWNERSHIP HAVE PASSED TO THE CUSTOMER, BASED ON THE TERMS OF

SALE. TITLE PASSES GENERALLY UPON SHIPMENT OR UPON RECEIPT BY THE CUSTOMER DEPENDING ON THE COUNTRY OF THE SALE AND THE AGREEMENT WITH THE CUSTOMER. RETAIL STORE REVENUES ARE RECORDED AT THE TIME OF SALE.

IN SOME INSTANCES, WE SHIP PRODUCT DIRECTLY FROM OUR SUPPLIER TO THE CUSTOMER AND RECOGNIZE REVENUE WHEN THE PRODUCT IS DELIVERED TO AND

ACCEPTED BY THE CUSTOMER. OUR REVENUES MAY FLUCTUATE IN CASES WHEN OUR CUSTOMERS DELAY ACCEPTING SHIPMENT OF PRODUCT FOR PERIODS UP TO SEVERAL WEEKS.

IN CERTAIN COUNTRIES OUTSIDE OF THE U.S., PRECISE INFORMATION REGARDING THE DATE OF RECEIPT BY THE CUSTOMER IS NOT READILY AVAILABLE. IN

THESE CASES, WE ESTIMATE THE DATE OF RECEIPT BY THE CUSTOMER BASED UPON HISTORICAL DELIVERY TIMES BY GEOGRAPHIC LOCATION. ON THE BASIS OF OUR TESTS OF ACTUAL TRANSACTIONS, WE HAVE NO INDICATION THAT THESE ESTIMATES HAVE BEEN MATERIALLY INACCURATE

HISTORICALLY.

AS PART OF OUR REVENUE RECOGNITION POLICY, WE RECORD ESTIMATED SALES RETURNS, DISCOUNTS AND MISCELLANEOUS

CLAIMS FROM CUSTOMERS AS REDUCTIONS TO REVENUES AT THE TIME REVENUES ARE RECORDED. WE BASE OUR ESTIMATES ON HISTORICAL RATES OF PRODUCT RETURNS, DISCOUNTS AND CLAIMS, AND SPECIFIC IDENTIFICATION OF OUTSTANDING CLAIMS AND OUTSTANDING RETURNS NOT YET

RECEIVED FROM CUSTOMERS. ACTUAL RETURNS, DISCOUNTS AND CLAIMS IN ANY FUTURE PERIOD ARE INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN AND THUS MAY DIFFER FROM OUR ESTIMATES. IF ACTUAL OR EXPECTED FUTURE RETURNS, DISCOUNTS AND CLAIMS WERE SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER OR LOWER THAN

THE RESERVES WE HAD ESTABLISHED, WE WOULD RECORD A REDUCTION OR INCREASE TO NET REVENUES IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH WE MADE SUCH DETERMINATION.

ALLOWANCE FOR UNCOLLECTIBLE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE

WE MAKE ONGOING ESTIMATES RELATING TO THE ABILITY TO COLLECT OUR ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND MAINTAIN AN ALLOWANCE FOR ESTIMATED LOSSES

RESULTING FROM THE INABILITY OF OUR CUSTOMERS TO MAKE REQUIRED PAYMENTS. IN DETERMINING THE AMOUNT OF THE ALLOWANCE, WE CONSIDER OUR HISTORICAL LEVEL OF CREDIT LOSSES AND MAKE JUDGMENTS ABOUT THE CREDITWORTHINESS OF SIGNIFICANT CUSTOMERS BASED ON

ONGOING CREDIT EVALUATIONS. SINCE WE CANNOT PREDICT

47

TABLE OF CONTENTS

FUTURE CHANGES IN THE FINANCIAL STABILITY OF OUR CUSTOMERS, ACTUAL FUTURE LOSSES FROM UNCOLLECTIBLE ACCOUNTS MAY DIFFER FROM OUR ESTIMATES. IF THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF OUR CUSTOMERS WERE TO

DETERIORATE, RESULTING IN THEIR INABILITY TO MAKE PAYMENTS, A LARGER ALLOWANCE MIGHT BE REQUIRED. IN THE EVENT WE DETERMINE THAT A SMALLER OR LARGER ALLOWANCE IS APPROPRIATE, WE WOULD RECORD A CREDIT OR A CHARGE TO SELLING AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE

IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH SUCH A DETERMINATION IS MADE.

INVENTORY RESERVES

WE ALSO MAKE ONGOING ESTIMATES RELATING TO THE NET REALIZABLE VALUE OF INVENTORIES, BASED UPON OUR ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT FUTURE DEMAND AND

MARKET CONDITIONS. IF WE ESTIMATE THAT THE NET REALIZABLE VALUE OF OUR INVENTORY IS LESS THAN THE COST OF THE INVENTORY RECORDED ON OUR BOOKS, WE RECORD A RESERVE EQUAL TO THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE COST OF THE INVENTORY AND THE ESTIMATED NET

REALIZABLE VALUE. THIS RESERVE IS RECORDED AS A CHARGE TO COST OF SALES. IF CHANGES IN MARKET CONDITIONS RESULT IN REDUCTIONS IN THE ESTIMATED NET REALIZABLE VALUE OF OUR INVENTORY BELOW OUR PREVIOUS ESTIMATE, WE WOULD INCREASE OUR RESERVE IN THE

PERIOD IN WHICH WE MADE SUCH A DETERMINATION AND RECORD A CHARGE TO COST OF SALES.

CONTINGENT PAYMENTS UNDER

ENDORSEMENT CONTRACTS

A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR DEMAND CREATION EXPENSE RELATES TO PAYMENTS UNDER ENDORSEMENT

CONTRACTS. IN GENERAL, ENDORSEMENT PAYMENTS ARE EXPENSED UNIFORMLY OVER THE TERM OF THE CONTRACT. HOWEVER, CERTAIN CONTRACT ELEMENTS MAY BE ACCOUNTED FOR DIFFERENTLY, BASED UPON THE FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES OF EACH INDIVIDUAL CONTRACT.

SOME OF THE CONTRACTS PROVIDE FOR CONTINGENT PAYMENTS TO ENDORSERS BASED UPON SPECIFIC ACHIEVEMENTS IN THEIR SPORTS (E.G., WINNING A

CHAMPIONSHIP). WE RECORD SELLING AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE FOR THESE AMOUNTS WHEN THE ENDORSER ACHIEVES THE SPECIFIC GOAL.

SOME OF THE CONTRACTS PROVIDE FOR PAYMENTS BASED UPON ENDORSERS MAINTAINING A LEVEL OF PERFORMANCE IN THEIR SPORT OVER AN EXTENDED PERIOD

OF TIME (E.G., MAINTAINING A TOP RANKING IN A SPORT FOR A YEAR). THESE AMOUNTS ARE REPORTED IN SELLING AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE WHEN WE DETERMINE THAT IT IS PROBABLE THAT THE SPECIFIED LEVEL OF PERFORMANCE WILL BE MAINTAINED THROUGHOUT THE PERIOD.

IN THESE INSTANCES, TO THE EXTENT THAT ACTUAL PAYMENTS TO THE ENDORSER DIFFER FROM OUR ESTIMATE DUE TO CHANGES IN THE ENDORSERS ATHLETIC PERFORMANCE, INCREASED OR DECREASED SELLING AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE MAY BE REPORTED IN A FUTURE PERIOD.

SOME OF THE CONTRACTS PROVIDE FOR ROYALTY PAYMENTS TO ENDORSERS BASED UPON A PREDETERMINED PERCENTAGE OF SALES OF PARTICULAR

PRODUCTS. WE EXPENSE THESE PAYMENTS IN COST OF SALES AS THE RELATED SALES OCCUR. IN CERTAIN CONTRACTS, WE OFFER MINIMUM GUARANTEED ROYALTY PAYMENTS. FOR CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS FOR WHICH WE ESTIMATE WE WILL NOT MEET THE MINIMUM GUARANTEED AMOUNT OF

ROYALTY FEES THROUGH SALES OF PRODUCT, WE RECORD THE AMOUNT OF THE GUARANTEED PAYMENT IN EXCESS OF THAT EARNED THROUGH SALES OF PRODUCT IN SELLING AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE UNIFORMLY OVER THE REMAINING GUARANTEE PERIOD.

PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT AND DEFINITE-LIVED ASSETS

PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT, INCLUDING BUILDINGS, EQUIPMENT, AND COMPUTER HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE ARE RECORDED AT COST (INCLUDING, IN SOME

CASES, THE COST OF INTERNAL LABOR) AND ARE DEPRECIATED OVER THE ESTIMATED USEFUL LIFE. CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES (SUCH AS TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES OR CHANGES TO OUR BUSINESS OPERATIONS) CAN RESULT IN DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE ACTUAL AND ESTIMATED USEFUL

LIVES. IN THOSE CASES WHERE WE DETERMINE THAT THE USEFUL LIFE OF A LONG-LIVED ASSET SHOULD BE SHORTENED, WE INCREASE DEPRECIATION EXPENSE OVER THE REMAINING USEFUL LIFE TO DEPRECIATE THE ASSETS NET BOOK VALUE TO ITS SALVAGE VALUE.

WE REVIEW THE CARRYING VALUE OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS OR ASSET GROUPS TO BE USED IN OPERATIONS WHENEVER EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES

INDICATE THAT THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF THE ASSETS MIGHT NOT BE RECOVERABLE. FACTORS THAT WOULD NECESSITATE AN IMPAIRMENT ASSESSMENT INCLUDE A SIGNIFICANT ADVERSE CHANGE IN THE EXTENT OR MANNER IN

48

TABLE OF CONTENTS

WHICH AN ASSET IS USED, A SIGNIFICANT ADVERSE CHANGE IN LEGAL FACTORS OR THE BUSINESS CLIMATE THAT COULD AFFECT THE VALUE OF THE ASSET, OR A SIGNIFICANT DECLINE IN THE OBSERVABLE MARKET VALUE OF

AN ASSET, AMONG OTHERS. IF SUCH FACTS INDICATE A POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT, WE WOULD ASSESS THE RECOVERABILITY OF AN ASSET GROUP BY DETERMINING IF THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE ASSET GROUP EXCEEDS THE SUM OF THE PROJECTED UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS EXPECTED TO

RESULT FROM THE USE AND EVENTUAL DISPOSITION OF THE ASSETS OVER THE REMAINING ECONOMIC LIFE OF THE PRIMARY ASSET IN THE ASSET GROUP. IF THE RECOVERABILITY TEST INDICATES THAT THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE ASSET GROUP IS NOT RECOVERABLE, WE WILL ESTIMATE

THE FAIR VALUE OF THE ASSET GROUP USING APPROPRIATE VALUATION METHODOLOGIES WHICH WOULD TYPICALLY INCLUDE AN ESTIMATE OF DISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS. ANY IMPAIRMENT WOULD BE MEASURED AS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE ASSET GROUPS CARRYING AMOUNT AND ITS

ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE.

GOODWILL AND INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS

WE PERFORM ANNUAL IMPAIRMENT TESTS ON GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS WITH INDEFINITE LIVES IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF EACH FISCAL YEAR, OR

WHEN EVENTS OCCUR OR CIRCUMSTANCES CHANGE THAT WOULD, MORE LIKELY THAN NOT, REDUCE THE FAIR VALUE OF A REPORTING UNIT OR AN INTANGIBLE ASSET WITH AN INDEFINITE LIFE BELOW ITS CARRYING VALUE. EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES THAT MAY TRIGGER

INTERIM IMPAIRMENT REVIEWS INCLUDE SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN BUSINESS CLIMATE, OPERATING RESULTS, PLANNED INVESTMENTS IN THE REPORTING UNIT, OR AN EXPECTATION THAT THE CARRYING AMOUNT MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE, AMONG OTHER FACTORS. THE IMPAIRMENT TEST

REQUIRES US TO ESTIMATE THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR REPORTING UNITS. IF THE CARRYING VALUE OF A REPORTING UNIT EXCEEDS ITS FAIR VALUE, THE GOODWILL OF THAT REPORTING UNIT IS POTENTIALLY IMPAIRED AND WE PROCEED TO STEP TWO OF THE IMPAIRMENT ANALYSIS. IN

STEP TWO OF THE ANALYSIS, WE MEASURE AND RECORD AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS EQUAL TO THE EXCESS OF THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE REPORTING UNITS GOODWILL OVER ITS IMPLIED FAIR VALUE SHOULD SUCH A CIRCUMSTANCE ARISE.

WE GENERALLY BASE OUR MEASUREMENT OF THE FAIR VALUE OF A REPORTING UNIT ON A BLENDED ANALYSIS OF THE PRESENT VALUE OF FUTURE DISCOUNTED

CASH FLOWS AND THE MARKET VALUATION APPROACH. THE DISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS MODEL INDICATES THE FAIR VALUE OF THE REPORTING UNIT BASED ON THE PRESENT VALUE OF THE CASH FLOWS WE EXPECT THE REPORTING UNIT TO GENERATE IN THE FUTURE. OUR SIGNIFICANT

ESTIMATES IN THE DISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS MODEL INCLUDE: OUR WEIGHTED AVERAGE COST OF CAPITAL; LONG-TERM RATE OF GROWTH AND PROFITABILITY OF THE REPORTING UNITS BUSINESS; AND WORKING CAPITAL EFFECTS. THE MARKET VALUATION APPROACH INDICATES THE

FAIR VALUE OF THE BUSINESS BASED ON A COMPARISON OF THE REPORTING UNIT TO COMPARABLE PUBLICLY TRADED FIRMS IN SIMILAR LINES OF BUSINESS. SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES IN THE MARKET VALUATION APPROACH MODEL INCLUDE IDENTIFYING SIMILAR COMPANIES WITH

COMPARABLE BUSINESS FACTORS SUCH AS SIZE, GROWTH, PROFITABILITY, RISK AND RETURN ON INVESTMENT AND ASSESSING COMPARABLE REVENUE AND OPERATING INCOME MULTIPLES IN ESTIMATING THE FAIR VALUE OF THE REPORTING UNIT.

WE BELIEVE THE WEIGHTED USE OF DISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS AND THE MARKET VALUATION APPROACH IS THE BEST METHOD FOR DETERMINING THE FAIR VALUE

OF OUR REPORTING UNITS BECAUSE THESE ARE THE MOST COMMON VALUATION METHODOLOGIES USED WITHIN OUR INDUSTRY, AND THE BLENDED USE OF BOTH MODELS COMPENSATES FOR THE INHERENT RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH EITHER MODEL IF USED ON A STAND-ALONE BASIS.

INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS PRIMARILY CONSIST OF ACQUIRED TRADE NAMES AND TRADEMARKS. IN MEASURING THE FAIR VALUE FOR THESE

INTANGIBLE ASSETS, WE UTILIZE THE RELIEF-FROM-ROYALTY METHOD. THIS METHOD ASSUMES THAT TRADE NAMES AND TRADEMARKS HAVE VALUE TO THE EXTENT THAT THEIR OWNER IS RELIEVED OF THE OBLIGATION TO PAY ROYALTIES FOR THE BENEFITS RECEIVED FROM THEM. THIS

METHOD REQUIRES US TO ESTIMATE THE FUTURE REVENUE FOR THE RELATED BRANDS, THE APPROPRIATE ROYALTY RATE AND THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE COST OF CAPITAL.

HEDGE ACCOUNTING FOR DERIVATIVES

WE USE FORWARD AND OPTION CONTRACTS TO HEDGE CERTAIN ANTICIPATED FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE TRANSACTIONS AS WELL AS CERTAIN RESULTING

RECEIVABLE OR PAYABLE BALANCES. WHEN SPECIFIC CRITERIA FOR HEDGE ACCOUNTING HAVE BEEN MET, CHANGES IN FAIR VALUES OF HEDGE CONTRACTS RELATING TO ANTICIPATED TRANSACTIONS ARE RECORDED IN OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME RATHER THAN NET INCOME UNTIL THE

UNDERLYING HEDGED TRANSACTION AFFECTS NET INCOME. IN MOST CASES, THIS RESULTS IN GAINS AND LOSSES ON HEDGE DERIVATIVES BEING RELEASED FROM OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME INTO

49

TABLE OF CONTENTS

NET INCOME SOME TIME AFTER THE MATURITY OF THE DERIVATIVE. ONE OF THE CRITERIA FOR THIS ACCOUNTING TREATMENT IS THAT THE FORWARD AND OPTION CONTRACTS AMOUNT SHOULD NOT BE IN EXCESS OF

SPECIFICALLY IDENTIFIED ANTICIPATED TRANSACTIONS. BY THEIR VERY NATURE, OUR ESTIMATES OF ANTICIPATED TRANSACTIONS MAY FLUCTUATE OVER TIME AND MAY ULTIMATELY VARY FROM ACTUAL TRANSACTIONS. WHEN ANTICIPATED TRANSACTION ESTIMATES OR ACTUAL TRANSACTION

AMOUNTS DECLINE BELOW HEDGED LEVELS, OR WHEN IT IS NOT PROBABLE THAT A FORECASTED TRANSACTION WILL OCCUR BY THE END OF THE ORIGINALLY SPECIFIED TIME PERIOD OR WITHIN AN ADDITIONAL TWO-MONTH PERIOD OF TIME THEREAFTER, WE ARE REQUIRED TO RECLASSIFY

THE INEFFECTIVE PORTION OF THE CUMULATIVE CHANGES IN FAIR VALUES OF THE RELATED HEDGE CONTRACTS FROM OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME TO OTHER (INCOME) EXPENSE, NET DURING THE QUARTER IN WHICH SUCH CHANGES OCCUR. ONCE AN ANTICIPATED TRANSACTION ESTIMATE

OR ACTUAL TRANSACTION AMOUNT DECREASES BELOW HEDGED LEVELS, WE MAKE ADJUSTMENTS TO THE RELATED HEDGE CONTRACT IN ORDER TO REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF THE HEDGE CONTRACT TO THAT OF THE REVISED ANTICIPATED TRANSACTION.

WE USE FORWARD CONTRACTS TO HEDGE OUR INVESTMENT IN THE NET ASSETS OF CERTAIN INTERNATIONAL SUBSIDIARIES TO OFFSET FOREIGN CURRENCY

TRANSLATION RELATED TO OUR NET INVESTMENT IN THOSE SUBSIDIARIES. WHEN APPROPRIATELY DESIGNATED AS A HEDGE, THE CHANGE IN FAIR VALUE OF THE FORWARD CONTRACTS HEDGING OUR NET INVESTMENTS IS REPORTED IN THE CUMULATIVE TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENT COMPONENT

OF ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME WITHIN STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY TO OFFSET THE FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENTS ON THOSE INVESTMENTS. AS THE VALUE OF OUR UNDERLYING NET INVESTMENTS IN WHOLLY-OWNED INTERNATIONAL SUBSIDIARIES IS

KNOWN AT THE TIME A HEDGE IS PLACED, THE DESIGNATED HEDGE IS MATCHED TO THE PORTION OF OUR NET INVESTMENT AT RISK. ACCORDINGLY, THE VARIABILITY INVOLVED IN NET INVESTMENT HEDGES IS SUBSTANTIALLY LESS THAN THAT OF OTHER TYPES OF HEDGE TRANSACTIONS

AND WE DO NOT EXPECT ANY MATERIAL INEFFECTIVENESS. WE CONSIDER, ON A QUARTERLY BASIS, THE NEED TO REDESIGNATE EXISTING HEDGE RELATIONSHIPS BASED ON CHANGES IN THE UNDERLYING NET INVESTMENT. SHOULD THE LEVEL OF OUR NET INVESTMENT DECREASE BELOW

HEDGED LEVELS, ANY RESULTING INEFFECTIVENESS WOULD BE REPORTED DIRECTLY TO EARNINGS IN THE PERIOD INCURRED.

STOCK-BASED

COMPENSATION

WE ACCOUNT FOR STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION BY ESTIMATING THE FAIR VALUE OF STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION ON THE

DATE OF GRANT USING THE BLACK-SCHOLES OPTION PRICING MODEL. THE BLACK-SCHOLES OPTION PRICING MODEL REQUIRES THE INPUT OF HIGHLY SUBJECTIVE ASSUMPTIONS INCLUDING VOLATILITY. EXPECTED VOLATILITY IS ESTIMATED BASED ON IMPLIED VOLATILITY IN MARKET

TRADED OPTIONS ON OUR COMMON STOCK WITH A TERM GREATER THAN ONE YEAR, ALONG WITH OTHER FACTORS. OUR DECISION TO USE IMPLIED VOLATILITY WAS BASED ON THE AVAILABILITY OF ACTIVELY TRADED OPTIONS ON OUR COMMON STOCK AND OUR ASSESSMENT THAT IMPLIED

VOLATILITY IS MORE REPRESENTATIVE OF FUTURE STOCK PRICE TRENDS THAN HISTORICAL VOLATILITY. IF FACTORS CHANGE AND WE USE DIFFERENT ASSUMPTIONS FOR ESTIMATING STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE IN FUTURE PERIODS, STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE MAY

DIFFER MATERIALLY IN THE FUTURE FROM THAT RECORDED IN THE CURRENT PERIOD.

TAXES

WE RECORD VALUATION ALLOWANCES AGAINST OUR DEFERRED TAX ASSETS, WHEN NECESSARY. REALIZATION OF DEFERRED TAX ASSETS (SUCH AS NET OPERATING

LOSS CARRY-FORWARDS) IS DEPENDENT ON FUTURE TAXABLE EARNINGS AND IS THEREFORE UNCERTAIN. AT LEAST QUARTERLY, WE ASSESS THE LIKELIHOOD THAT OUR DEFERRED TAX ASSET BALANCE WILL BE RECOVERED FROM FUTURE TAXABLE INCOME. TO THE EXTENT WE BELIEVE THAT

RECOVERY IS NOT LIKELY, WE ESTABLISH A VALUATION ALLOWANCE AGAINST OUR DEFERRED TAX ASSET, WHICH INCREASES OUR INCOME TAX EXPENSE IN THE PERIOD WHEN SUCH DETERMINATION IS MADE.

IN ADDITION, WE HAVE NOT RECORDED U.S. INCOME TAX EXPENSE FOR FOREIGN EARNINGS THAT WE HAVE DETERMINED TO BE INDEFINITELY REINVESTED

OFFSHORE, THUS REDUCING OUR OVERALL INCOME TAX EXPENSE. THE AMOUNT OF EARNINGS DESIGNATED AS INDEFINITELY REINVESTED OFFSHORE IS BASED UPON THE ACTUAL DEPLOYMENT OF SUCH EARNINGS IN OUR OFFSHORE ASSETS AND OUR EXPECTATIONS OF THE FUTURE CASH NEEDS

OF OUR U.S. AND FOREIGN ENTITIES. INCOME TAX CONSIDERATIONS ARE ALSO A FACTOR IN DETERMINING THE AMOUNT OF FOREIGN EARNINGS TO BE INDEFINITELY REINVESTED OFFSHORE.

50

TABLE OF CONTENTS

WE CAREFULLY REVIEW ALL FACTORS THAT DRIVE THE ULTIMATE DISPOSITION OF FOREIGN EARNINGS

DETERMINED TO BE REINVESTED OFFSHORE, AND APPLY STRINGENT STANDARDS TO OVERCOMING THE PRESUMPTION OF REPATRIATION. DESPITE THIS APPROACH, BECAUSE THE DETERMINATION INVOLVES OUR FUTURE PLANS AND EXPECTATIONS OF FUTURE EVENTS, THE POSSIBILITY EXISTS

THAT AMOUNTS DECLARED AS INDEFINITELY REINVESTED OFFSHORE MAY ULTIMATELY BE REPATRIATED. FOR INSTANCE, THE ACTUAL CASH NEEDS OF OUR U.S. ENTITIES MAY EXCEED OUR CURRENT EXPECTATIONS, OR THE ACTUAL CASH NEEDS OF OUR FOREIGN ENTITIES MAY BE LESS THAN

OUR CURRENT EXPECTATIONS. THIS WOULD RESULT IN ADDITIONAL INCOME TAX EXPENSE IN THE YEAR WE DETERMINED THAT AMOUNTS WERE NO LONGER INDEFINITELY REINVESTED OFFSHORE. CONVERSELY, OUR APPROACH MAY ALSO RESULT IN A DETERMINATION THAT ACCUMULATED FOREIGN

EARNINGS (FOR WHICH U.S. INCOME TAXES HAVE BEEN PROVIDED) WILL BE INDEFINITELY REINVESTED OFFSHORE. IN THIS CASE, OUR INCOME TAX EXPENSE WOULD BE REDUCED IN THE YEAR OF SUCH DETERMINATION.

ON AN INTERIM BASIS, WE ESTIMATE WHAT OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE WILL BE FOR THE FULL FISCAL YEAR. THE ESTIMATED ANNUAL EFFECTIVE TAX RATE IS

THEN APPLIED TO THE YEAR-TO-DATE PRE-TAX INCOME EXCLUDING INFREQUENTLY OCCURRING OR UNUSUAL ITEMS, TO DETERMINE THE YEAR-TO-DATE TAX EXPENSE. THE INCOME TAX EFFECTS OF INFREQUENT OR UNUSUAL ITEMS ARE RECOGNIZED IN THE INTERIM PERIOD IN WHICH THEY

OCCUR. AS THE FISCAL YEAR PROGRESSES, WE CONTINUALLY REFINE OUR ESTIMATE BASED UPON ACTUAL EVENTS AND EARNINGS BY JURISDICTION DURING THE YEAR. THIS CONTINUAL ESTIMATION PROCESS PERIODICALLY RESULTS IN A CHANGE TO OUR EXPECTED EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR

THE FISCAL YEAR. WHEN THIS OCCURS, WE ADJUST THE INCOME TAX PROVISION DURING THE QUARTER IN WHICH THE CHANGE IN ESTIMATE OCCURS SO THAT THE YEAR-TO-DATE PROVISION EQUALS THE EXPECTED ANNUAL RATE.

ON A QUARTERLY BASIS, WE REEVALUATE THE PROBABILITY THAT A TAX POSITION WILL BE EFFECTIVELY SUSTAINED AND THE APPROPRIATENESS OF THE

AMOUNT RECOGNIZED FOR UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS BASED ON FACTORS INCLUDING CHANGES IN FACTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES, CHANGES IN TAX LAW, SETTLED AUDIT ISSUES AND NEW AUDIT ACTIVITY. CHANGES IN OUR ASSESSMENT MAY RESULT IN THE RECOGNITION OF A TAX BENEFIT OR

AN ADDITIONAL CHARGE TO THE TAX PROVISION IN THE PERIOD OUR ASSESSMENT CHANGES. WE RECOGNIZE INTEREST AND PENALTIES RELATED TO INCOME TAX MATTERS IN INCOME TAX EXPENSE.

OTHER CONTINGENCIES

IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS, WE ARE INVOLVED IN LEGAL PROCEEDINGS REGARDING CONTRACTUAL AND EMPLOYMENT RELATIONSHIPS, PRODUCT

LIABILITY CLAIMS, TRADEMARK RIGHTS, AND A VARIETY OF OTHER MATTERS. WE RECORD CONTINGENT LIABILITIES RESULTING FROM CLAIMS AGAINST US, INCLUDING RELATED LEGAL COSTS, WHEN A LOSS IS ASSESSED TO BE PROBABLE AND THE AMOUNT OF THE LOSS IS REASONABLY

ESTIMABLE. ASSESSING PROBABILITY OF LOSS AND ESTIMATING PROBABLE LOSSES REQUIRES ANALYSIS OF MULTIPLE FACTORS, INCLUDING IN SOME CASES JUDGMENTS ABOUT THE POTENTIAL ACTIONS OF THIRD PARTY CLAIMANTS AND COURTS. RECORDED CONTINGENT LIABILITIES ARE

BASED ON THE BEST INFORMATION AVAILABLE AND ACTUAL LOSSES IN ANY FUTURE PERIOD ARE INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN. IF FUTURE ADJUSTMENTS TO ESTIMATED PROBABLE FUTURE LOSSES OR ACTUAL LOSSES EXCEED OUR RECORDED LIABILITY FOR SUCH CLAIMS, WE WOULD RECORD

ADDITIONAL CHARGES AS OTHER (INCOME) EXPENSE, NET DURING THE PERIOD IN WHICH THE ACTUAL LOSS OR CHANGE IN ESTIMATE OCCURRED. IN ADDITION TO CONTINGENT LIABILITIES RECORDED FOR PROBABLE LOSSES, WE DISCLOSE CONTINGENT LIABILITIES WHEN THERE IS A

REASONABLE POSSIBILITY THAT THE ULTIMATE LOSS WILL MATERIALLY EXCEED THE RECORDED LIABILITY. CURRENTLY, WE DO NOT BELIEVE THAT ANY OF OUR PENDING LEGAL PROCEEDINGS OR CLAIMS WILL HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR FINANCIAL POSITION OR RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS.

ITEM 7A.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS AND CONSISTENT WITH ESTABLISHED POLICIES AND PROCEDURES, WE EMPLOY A VARIETY OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS TO

MANAGE EXPOSURE TO FLUCTUATIONS IN THE VALUE OF FOREIGN CURRENCIES AND INTEREST RATES. IT IS OUR POLICY TO UTILIZE THESE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS ONLY WHERE NECESSARY TO FINANCE OUR BUSINESS AND MANAGE SUCH EXPOSURES; WE DO NOT ENTER INTO THESE

TRANSACTIONS FOR SPECULATIVE PURPOSES.

WE ARE EXPOSED TO FOREIGN CURRENCY FLUCTUATION AS A RESULT OF OUR INTERNATIONAL SALES,

PRODUCT SOURCING AND FUNDING ACTIVITIES. OUR FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK MANAGEMENT PROGRAM IS INTENDED TO MINIMIZE BOTH THE POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE EFFECTS OF CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS ON OUR CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL POSITION AND CASH

51

TABLE OF CONTENTS

FLOWS. THIS ALSO HAS THE EFFECT OF DELAYING THE IMPACT OF CURRENT MARKET RATES ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS DEPENDENT UPON HEDGE HORIZONS. WE USE FORWARD EXCHANGE CONTRACTS AND

OPTIONS TO HEDGE CERTAIN ANTICIPATED BUT NOT YET FIRMLY COMMITTED TRANSACTIONS AS WELL AS CERTAIN FIRM COMMITMENTS AND THE RELATED RECEIVABLES AND PAYABLES, INCLUDING THIRD PARTY AND INTERCOMPANY TRANSACTIONS. WE ALSO USE FORWARD CONTRACTS TO HEDGE

OUR INVESTMENT IN THE NET ASSETS OF CERTAIN INTERNATIONAL SUBSIDIARIES TO OFFSET FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENTS RELATED TO OUR NET INVESTMENT IN THOSE SUBSIDIARIES.

WHEN WE BEGIN HEDGING EXPOSURES, THE TYPE AND DURATION OF EACH HEDGE DEPENDS ON THE NATURE OF THE EXPOSURE AND MARKET CONDITIONS.

GENERALLY, ALL ANTICIPATED AND FIRMLY COMMITTED TRANSACTIONS THAT ARE HEDGED ARE TO BE RECOGNIZED WITHIN 12 TO 18 MONTHS. THE MAJORITY OF THE CONTRACTS EXPIRING IN MORE THAN 12 MONTHS RELATE TO THE ANTICIPATED PURCHASE OF INVENTORY. WHEN

INTERCOMPANY LOANS ARE HEDGED, IT IS TYPICALLY FOR THEIR EXPECTED DURATION. HEDGED TRANSACTIONS ARE PRINCIPALLY DENOMINATED IN EUROS, JAPANESE YEN AND BRITISH POUNDS. SEE SECTION FOREIGN CURRENCY EXPOSURES AND HEDGING PRACTICES UNDER

ITEM 7 FOR ADDITIONAL DETAIL.

OUR EARNINGS ARE ALSO EXPOSED TO MOVEMENTS IN SHORT AND LONG-TERM MARKET INTEREST RATES.

OUR OBJECTIVE IN MANAGING THIS INTEREST RATE EXPOSURE IS TO LIMIT THE IMPACT OF INTEREST RATE CHANGES ON EARNINGS AND CASH FLOWS AND TO REDUCE OVERALL BORROWING COSTS. TO ACHIEVE THESE OBJECTIVES, WE MAINTAIN A MIX OF COMMERCIAL PAPER, BANK LOANS

AND FIXED RATE DEBT OF VARYING MATURITIES AND HAVE ENTERED INTO RECEIVE-FIXED, PAY-VARIABLE INTEREST RATE SWAPS.

MARKET RISK MEASUREMENT

WE MONITOR FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK, INTEREST RATE RISK AND RELATED DERIVATIVES USING A VARIETY OF TECHNIQUES INCLUDING A

REVIEW OF MARKET VALUE, SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS, AND VALUE-AT-RISK (VAR). OUR MARKET-SENSITIVE DERIVATIVE AND OTHER FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS ARE FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS, FOREIGN CURRENCY OPTION CONTRACTS, INTEREST RATE SWAPS,

INTERCOMPANY LOANS DENOMINATED IN NON-FUNCTIONAL CURRENCIES, FIXED INTEREST RATE U.S. DOLLAR DENOMINATED DEBT, AND FIXED INTEREST RATE JAPANESE YEN DENOMINATED DEBT.

WE USE VAR TO MONITOR THE FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK OF OUR FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD AND FOREIGN CURRENCY OPTION DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS ONLY.

THE VAR DETERMINES THE MAXIMUM POTENTIAL ONE-DAY LOSS IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THESE FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATE-SENSITIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS. THE VAR MODEL ESTIMATES ASSUME NORMAL MARKET CONDITIONS AND A 95% CONFIDENCE LEVEL. THERE ARE VARIOUS MODELING

TECHNIQUES THAT CAN BE USED IN THE VAR COMPUTATION. OUR COMPUTATIONS ARE BASED ON INTERRELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN CURRENCIES AND INTEREST RATES (A VARIANCE/CO-VARIANCE TECHNIQUE). THESE INTERRELATIONSHIPS ARE A FUNCTION OF FOREIGN

EXCHANGE CURRENCY MARKET CHANGES AND INTEREST RATE CHANGES OVER THE PRECEDING ONE YEAR PERIOD. THE VALUE OF FOREIGN CURRENCY OPTIONS DOES NOT CHANGE ON A ONE-TO-ONE BASIS WITH CHANGES IN THE UNDERLYING CURRENCY RATE. WE ADJUSTED THE POTENTIAL LOSS

IN OPTION VALUE FOR THE ESTIMATED SENSITIVITY (THE DELTA AND GAMMA) TO CHANGES IN THE UNDERLYING CURRENCY RATE. THIS CALCULATION REFLECTS THE IMPACT OF FOREIGN CURRENCY RATE FLUCTUATIONS ON THE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS ONLY AND

DOES NOT INCLUDE THE IMPACT OF SUCH RATE FLUCTUATIONS ON NON-FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY TRANSACTIONS (SUCH AS ANTICIPATED TRANSACTIONS, FIRM COMMITMENTS, CASH BALANCES, AND ACCOUNTS AND LOANS RECEIVABLE AND PAYABLE), INCLUDING THOSE WHICH ARE HEDGED BY

THESE INSTRUMENTS.

THE VAR MODEL IS A RISK ANALYSIS TOOL AND DOES NOT PURPORT TO REPRESENT ACTUAL LOSSES IN FAIR VALUE THAT

WE WILL INCUR, NOR DOES IT CONSIDER THE POTENTIAL EFFECT OF FAVORABLE CHANGES IN MARKET RATES. IT ALSO DOES NOT REPRESENT THE FULL EXTENT OF THE POSSIBLE LOSS THAT MAY OCCUR. ACTUAL FUTURE GAINS AND LOSSES WILL DIFFER FROM THOSE ESTIMATED BECAUSE OF

CHANGES OR DIFFERENCES IN MARKET RATES AND INTERRELATIONSHIPS, HEDGING INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGE PERCENTAGES, TIMING AND OTHER FACTORS.

THE ESTIMATED MAXIMUM ONE-DAY LOSS IN FAIR VALUE ON OUR FOREIGN CURRENCY SENSITIVE DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, DERIVED USING THE

VAR MODEL, WAS $17 MILLION AND $68 MILLION AT MAY 31, 2010 AND 2009, RESPECTIVELY. THE VAR DECREASED YEAR-OVER-YEAR AS A RESULT OF REDUCED TOTAL NOTIONAL VALUE OF OUR FOREIGN

52

TABLE OF CONTENTS

CURRENCY DERIVATIVE PORTFOLIO COMBINED WITH DECREASED FOREIGN CURRENCY VOLATILITIES AT MAY 31, 2010. SUCH A HYPOTHETICAL LOSS IN FAIR VALUE OF OUR DERIVATIVES WOULD BE OFFSET BY INCREASES IN

THE VALUE OF THE UNDERLYING TRANSACTIONS BEING HEDGED. THE AVERAGE MONTHLY CHANGE IN THE FAIR VALUES OF FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD AND FOREIGN CURRENCY OPTION DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS WAS $52 MILLION AND $207 MILLION DURING FISCAL 2010 AND FISCAL 2009,

RESPECTIVELY.

THE INSTRUMENTS NOT INCLUDED IN THE VAR ARE INTERCOMPANY LOANS DENOMINATED IN NON-FUNCTIONAL CURRENCIES, FIXED

INTEREST RATE JAPANESE YEN DENOMINATED DEBT, FIXED INTEREST RATE U.S. DOLLAR DENOMINATED DEBT AND INTEREST RATE SWAPS. INTERCOMPANY LOANS AND RELATED INTEREST AMOUNTS ARE ELIMINATED IN CONSOLIDATION. FURTHERMORE, OUR NON-FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY

INTERCOMPANY LOANS ARE SUBSTANTIALLY HEDGED AGAINST FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK THROUGH THE USE OF FORWARD CONTRACTS, WHICH ARE INCLUDED IN THE VAR CALCULATION ABOVE. WE, THEREFORE, CONSIDER THE INTEREST RATE AND FOREIGN CURRENCY MARKET RISKS ASSOCIATED

WITH OUR NON-FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY INTERCOMPANY LOANS TO BE IMMATERIAL TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL POSITION, RESULTS FROM OPERATIONS AND CASH FLOWS.

DETAILS OF THIRD PARTY DEBT AND INTEREST RATE SWAPS ARE PROVIDED IN THE TABLE BELOW. THE TABLE PRESENTS PRINCIPAL CASH FLOWS AND RELATED

WEIGHTED AVERAGE INTEREST RATES BY EXPECTED MATURITY DATES. WEIGHTED AVERAGE INTEREST RATES FOR THE FIXED RATE SWAPPED TO FLOATING RATE DEBT REFLECT THE EFFECTIVE INTEREST RATES AS OF MAY 31, 2010.

MANAGEMENTS ANNUAL REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

MANAGEMENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ESTABLISHING AND MAINTAINING ADEQUATE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, AS SUCH TERM IS DEFINED IN

RULE 13A-15(F) AND RULE 15D-15(F) OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934, AS AMENDED. INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING IS A PROCESS DESIGNED TO PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING THE RELIABILITY OF FINANCIAL REPORTING AND THE

PREPARATION OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR EXTERNAL PURPOSES IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING INCLUDES THOSE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES THAT.

(I) PERTAIN TO THE MAINTENANCE OF RECORDS THAT, IN REASONABLE DETAIL, ACCURATELY AND FAIRLY REFLECT THE TRANSACTIONS AND DISPOSITIONS OF ASSETS OF THE COMPANY; (II) PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE THAT TRANSACTIONS ARE RECORDED AS NECESSARY

TO PERMIT PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES, AND THAT RECEIPTS AND EXPENDITURES OF THE COMPANY ARE BEING MADE ONLY IN ACCORDANCE WITH AUTHORIZATIONS OF OUR MANAGEMENT AND DIRECTORS; AND

(III) PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING PREVENTION OR TIMELY DETECTION OF UNAUTHORIZED ACQUISITION, USE OR DISPOSITION OF ASSETS OF THE COMPANY THAT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

WHILE REASONABLE ASSURANCE IS A HIGH LEVEL OF ASSURANCE, IT DOES NOT MEAN ABSOLUTE ASSURANCE. BECAUSE OF ITS INHERENT

LIMITATIONS, INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING MAY NOT PREVENT OR DETECT EVERY MISSTATEMENT AND INSTANCE OF FRAUD. CONTROLS ARE SUSCEPTIBLE TO MANIPULATION, ESPECIALLY IN INSTANCES OF FRAUD CAUSED BY THE COLLUSION OF TWO OR MORE PEOPLE,

INCLUDING OUR SENIOR MANAGEMENT. ALSO, PROJECTIONS OF ANY EVALUATION OF EFFECTIVENESS TO FUTURE PERIODS ARE SUBJECT TO THE RISK THAT CONTROLS MAY BECOME INADEQUATE BECAUSE OF CHANGES IN CONDITIONS, OR THAT THE DEGREE OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE POLICIES

OR PROCEDURES MAY DETERIORATE.

UNDER THE SUPERVISION AND WITH THE PARTICIPATION OF OUR CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND CHIEF

FINANCIAL OFFICER, OUR MANAGEMENT CONDUCTED AN EVALUATION OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING BASED UPON THE FRAMEWORK IN

BASIS OF CONSOLIDATION

THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDE THE ACCOUNTS OF NIKE, INC. AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES (THE COMPANY). ALL

SIGNIFICANT INTERCOMPANY TRANSACTIONS AND BALANCES HAVE BEEN ELIMINATED.

RECOGNITION OF REVENUES

WHOLESALE REVENUES ARE RECOGNIZED WHEN TITLE PASSES AND THE RISKS AND REWARDS OF OWNERSHIP HAVE PASSED TO THE CUSTOMER, BASED ON THE TERMS

OF SALE. THIS OCCURS UPON SHIPMENT OR UPON RECEIPT BY THE CUSTOMER DEPENDING ON THE COUNTRY OF THE SALE AND THE AGREEMENT WITH THE CUSTOMER. RETAIL STORE REVENUES ARE RECORDED AT THE TIME OF SALE. PROVISIONS FOR SALES DISCOUNTS, RETURNS AND

MISCELLANEOUS CLAIMS FROM CUSTOMERS ARE MADE AT THE TIME OF SALE. AS OF MAY 31, 2010 AND 2009, THE COMPANYS RESERVE BALANCES FOR SALES DISCOUNTS, RETURNS AND MISCELLANEOUS CLAIMS WERE $370.6 MILLION AND $363.6 MILLION,

RESPECTIVELY.

SHIPPING AND HANDLING COSTS

SHIPPING AND HANDLING COSTS ARE EXPENSED AS INCURRED AND INCLUDED IN COST OF SALES.

ADVERTISING AND PROMOTION

ADVERTISING PRODUCTION COSTS ARE EXPENSED THE FIRST TIME THE ADVERTISEMENT IS RUN. MEDIA (TV AND PRINT) PLACEMENT COSTS ARE EXPENSED IN

THE MONTH THE ADVERTISING APPEARS.

A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF THE COMPANYS PROMOTIONAL EXPENSES RESULT FROM PAYMENTS UNDER

ENDORSEMENT CONTRACTS. ACCOUNTING FOR ENDORSEMENT PAYMENTS IS BASED UPON SPECIFIC CONTRACT PROVISIONS. GENERALLY, ENDORSEMENT PAYMENTS ARE EXPENSED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THE TERM OF THE CONTRACT AFTER GIVING RECOGNITION TO PERIODIC

PERFORMANCE COMPLIANCE PROVISIONS OF THE CONTRACTS. PREPAYMENTS MADE UNDER CONTRACTS ARE INCLUDED IN PREPAID EXPENSES OR OTHER ASSETS DEPENDING ON THE PERIOD TO WHICH THE PREPAYMENT APPLIES.

THROUGH COOPERATIVE ADVERTISING PROGRAMS, THE COMPANY REIMBURSES RETAIL CUSTOMERS FOR CERTAIN COSTS OF ADVERTISING THE COMPANYS

PRODUCTS. THE COMPANY RECORDS THESE COSTS IN SELLING AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE AT THE POINT IN TIME WHEN IT IS OBLIGATED TO ITS CUSTOMERS FOR THE COSTS, WHICH IS WHEN THE RELATED REVENUES ARE RECOGNIZED. THIS OBLIGATION MAY ARISE PRIOR TO THE

RELATED ADVERTISEMENT BEING RUN.

TOTAL ADVERTISING AND PROMOTION EXPENSES WERE $2,356.4 MILLION, $2,351.3 MILLION, AND

$2,308.3 MILLION FOR THE YEARS ENDED MAY 31, 2010, 2009 AND 2008, RESPECTIVELY. PREPAID ADVERTISING AND PROMOTION EXPENSES RECORDED IN PREPAID EXPENSES AND OTHER ASSETS TOTALED $260.7 MILLION AND $280.0 MILLION AT MAY 31, 2010 AND 2009,

RESPECTIVELY.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (CONTINUED)

CASH AND EQUIVALENTS

CASH AND EQUIVALENTS REPRESENT CASH AND SHORT-TERM, HIGHLY LIQUID INVESTMENTS WITH MATURITIES OF THREE MONTHS OR LESS AT DATE OF PURCHASE.

THE CARRYING AMOUNTS REFLECTED IN THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET FOR CASH AND EQUIVALENTS APPROXIMATE FAIR VALUE.

SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS

SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS CONSIST OF HIGHLY LIQUID INVESTMENTS, PRIMARILY COMMERCIAL PAPER, U.S. TREASURY, U.S. AGENCY, AND CORPORATE DEBT

SECURITIES, WITH MATURITIES OVER THREE MONTHS FROM THE DATE OF PURCHASE. DEBT SECURITIES THAT THE COMPANY HAS THE ABILITY AND POSITIVE INTENT TO HOLD TO MATURITY ARE CARRIED AT AMORTIZED COST. AT MAY 31, 2010 AND 2009, THE COMPANY DID NOT HOLD

ANY SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS THAT WERE CLASSIFIED AS HELD-TO-MATURITY.

AT MAY 31, 2010 AND 2009, SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS

CONSISTED OF AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE SECURITIES. AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE SECURITIES ARE RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE WITH UNREALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES REPORTED, NET OF TAX, IN OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME, UNLESS UNREALIZED LOSSES ARE DETERMINED TO BE OTHER THAN

TEMPORARY. THE COMPANY CONSIDERS ALL AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE SECURITIES, INCLUDING THOSE WITH MATURITY DATES BEYOND 12 MONTHS, AS AVAILABLE TO SUPPORT CURRENT OPERATIONAL LIQUIDITY NEEDS AND THEREFORE CLASSIFIES ALL SECURITIES WITH MATURITY DATES BEYOND

THREE MONTHS AS CURRENT ASSETS WITHIN SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET.

SEE NOTE 6  FAIR VALUE

MEASUREMENTS FOR MORE INFORMATION ON THE COMPANYS SHORT TERM INVESTMENTS.

ALLOWANCE FOR UNCOLLECTIBLE ACCOUNTS

RECEIVABLE

ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE CONSISTS PRIMARILY OF AMOUNTS RECEIVABLE FROM CUSTOMERS. WE MAKE ONGOING ESTIMATES

RELATING TO THE COLLECTABILITY OF OUR ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND MAINTAIN AN ALLOWANCE FOR ESTIMATED LOSSES RESULTING FROM THE INABILITY OF OUR CUSTOMERS TO MAKE REQUIRED PAYMENTS. IN DETERMINING THE AMOUNT OF THE ALLOWANCE, WE CONSIDER OUR HISTORICAL

LEVEL OF CREDIT LOSSES AND MAKE JUDGMENTS ABOUT THE CREDITWORTHINESS OF SIGNIFICANT CUSTOMERS BASED ON ONGOING CREDIT EVALUATIONS. ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE WITH ANTICIPATED COLLECTION DATES GREATER THAN 12 MONTHS FROM THE BALANCE SHEET DATE AND RELATED

ALLOWANCES ARE CONSIDERED NON-CURRENT AND RECORDED IN OTHER ASSETS. THE ALLOWANCE FOR UNCOLLECTIBLE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE WAS $116.7 MILLION AND $110.8 MILLION AT MAY 31, 2010 AND 2009, RESPECTIVELY, OF WHICH $43.1 MILLION AND $36.9 MILLION WAS

CLASSIFIED AS LONG-TERM AND RECORDED IN OTHER ASSETS.

INVENTORY VALUATION

INVENTORIES ARE STATED AT LOWER OF COST OR MARKET AND VALUED ON A FIRST-IN, FIRST-OUT (FIFO) OR MOVING AVERAGE COST BASIS.

PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT AND DEPRECIATION

PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT ARE RECORDED AT COST. DEPRECIATION FOR FINANCIAL REPORTING PURPOSES IS DETERMINED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS

FOR BUILDINGS AND LEASEHOLD IMPROVEMENTS OVER 2 TO 40 YEARS AND FOR MACHINERY AND EQUIPMENT OVER 2 TO 15 YEARS. COMPUTER SOFTWARE (INCLUDING, IN SOME CASES, THE COST OF INTERNAL LABOR) IS DEPRECIATED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER 3 TO 10 YEARS.

IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS

THE COMPANY REVIEWS THE CARRYING VALUE OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS OR ASSET GROUPS TO BE USED IN OPERATIONS WHENEVER EVENTS OR CHANGES IN

CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THAT THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF THE ASSETS MIGHT NOT BE

61

TABLE OF CONTENTS

NIKE, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (CONTINUED)

RECOVERABLE. FACTORS THAT WOULD NECESSITATE AN IMPAIRMENT ASSESSMENT INCLUDE A SIGNIFICANT ADVERSE CHANGE IN THE EXTENT OR MANNER IN WHICH AN ASSET IS USED, A SIGNIFICANT ADVERSE CHANGE IN LEGAL

FACTORS OR THE BUSINESS CLIMATE THAT COULD AFFECT THE VALUE OF THE ASSET, OR A SIGNIFICANT DECLINE IN THE OBSERVABLE MARKET VALUE OF AN ASSET, AMONG OTHERS. IF SUCH FACTS INDICATE A POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT, THE COMPANY WOULD ASSESS THE RECOVERABILITY

OF AN ASSET GROUP BY DETERMINING IF THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE ASSET GROUP EXCEEDS THE SUM OF THE PROJECTED UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS EXPECTED TO RESULT FROM THE USE AND EVENTUAL DISPOSITION OF THE ASSETS OVER THE REMAINING ECONOMIC LIFE OF THE PRIMARY

ASSET IN THE ASSET GROUP. IF THE RECOVERABILITY TEST INDICATES THAT THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE ASSET GROUP IS NOT RECOVERABLE, THE COMPANY WILL ESTIMATE THE FAIR VALUE OF THE ASSET GROUP USING APPROPRIATE VALUATION METHODOLOGIES WHICH WOULD TYPICALLY

INCLUDE AN ESTIMATE OF DISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS. ANY IMPAIRMENT WOULD BE MEASURED AS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE ASSET GROUPS CARRYING AMOUNT AND ITS ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE.

IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND GOODWILL

THE COMPANY PERFORMS ANNUAL IMPAIRMENT TESTS ON GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS WITH INDEFINITE LIVES IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF EACH FISCAL

YEAR, OR WHEN EVENTS OCCUR OR CIRCUMSTANCES CHANGE THAT WOULD, MORE LIKELY THAN NOT, REDUCE THE FAIR VALUE OF A REPORTING UNIT OR AN INTANGIBLE ASSET WITH AN INDEFINITE LIFE BELOW ITS CARRYING VALUE. EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES THAT MAY

TRIGGER INTERIM IMPAIRMENT REVIEWS INCLUDE SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN BUSINESS CLIMATE, OPERATING RESULTS, PLANNED INVESTMENTS IN THE REPORTING UNIT, OR AN EXPECTATION THAT THE CARRYING AMOUNT MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE, AMONG OTHER FACTORS. THE IMPAIRMENT

TEST REQUIRES THE COMPANY TO ESTIMATE THE FAIR VALUE OF ITS REPORTING UNITS. IF THE CARRYING VALUE OF A REPORTING UNIT EXCEEDS ITS FAIR VALUE, THE GOODWILL OF THAT REPORTING UNIT IS POTENTIALLY IMPAIRED AND THE COMPANY PROCEEDS TO STEP TWO OF THE

IMPAIRMENT ANALYSIS. IN STEP TWO OF THE ANALYSIS, THE COMPANY MEASURES AND RECORDS AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS EQUAL TO THE EXCESS OF THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE REPORTING UNITS GOODWILL OVER ITS IMPLIED FAIR VALUE SHOULD SUCH A CIRCUMSTANCE ARISE.

THE COMPANY GENERALLY BASES ITS MEASUREMENT OF FAIR VALUE OF A REPORTING UNIT ON A BLENDED ANALYSIS OF THE PRESENT VALUE OF

FUTURE DISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS AND THE MARKET VALUATION APPROACH. THE DISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS MODEL INDICATES THE FAIR VALUE OF THE REPORTING UNIT BASED ON THE PRESENT VALUE OF THE CASH FLOWS THAT THE COMPANY EXPECTS THE REPORTING UNIT TO GENERATE IN

THE FUTURE. THE COMPANYS SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES IN THE DISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS MODEL INCLUDE: ITS WEIGHTED AVERAGE COST OF CAPITAL; LONG-TERM RATE OF GROWTH AND PROFITABILITY OF THE REPORTING UNITS BUSINESS; AND WORKING CAPITAL EFFECTS. THE

MARKET VALUATION APPROACH INDICATES THE FAIR VALUE OF THE BUSINESS BASED ON A COMPARISON OF THE REPORTING UNIT TO COMPARABLE PUBLICLY TRADED COMPANIES IN SIMILAR LINES OF BUSINESS. SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES IN THE MARKET VALUATION APPROACH MODEL INCLUDE

IDENTIFYING SIMILAR COMPANIES WITH COMPARABLE BUSINESS FACTORS SUCH AS SIZE, GROWTH, PROFITABILITY, RISK AND RETURN ON INVESTMENT, AND ASSESSING COMPARABLE REVENUE AND OPERATING INCOME MULTIPLES IN ESTIMATING THE FAIR VALUE OF THE REPORTING UNIT.

THE COMPANY BELIEVES THE WEIGHTED USE OF DISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS AND THE MARKET VALUATION APPROACH IS THE BEST METHOD FOR

DETERMINING THE FAIR VALUE OF ITS REPORTING UNITS BECAUSE THESE ARE THE MOST COMMON VALUATION METHODOLOGIES USED WITHIN ITS INDUSTRY; AND THE BLENDED USE OF BOTH MODELS COMPENSATES FOR THE INHERENT RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH EITHER MODEL IF USED ON A

STAND-ALONE BASIS.

INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS PRIMARILY CONSIST OF ACQUIRED TRADE NAMES AND TRADEMARKS. IN MEASURING

THE FAIR VALUE FOR THESE INTANGIBLE ASSETS, THE COMPANY UTILIZES THE RELIEF-FROM-ROYALTY METHOD. THIS METHOD ASSUMES THAT TRADE NAMES AND TRADEMARKS HAVE VALUE TO THE EXTENT THAT THEIR OWNER IS RELIEVED OF THE OBLIGATION TO PAY ROYALTIES FOR THE

BENEFITS RECEIVED FROM THEM. THIS METHOD REQUIRES THE COMPANY TO ESTIMATE THE FUTURE REVENUE FOR THE RELATED BRANDS, THE APPROPRIATE ROYALTY RATE AND THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE COST OF CAPITAL.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (CONTINUED)

FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION AND FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSACTIONS

ADJUSTMENTS RESULTING FROM TRANSLATING FOREIGN FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INTO U.S. DOLLARS ARE INCLUDED IN THE FOREIGN

CURRENCY TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENT, A COMPONENT OF ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME IN SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY.

THE

COMPANYS GLOBAL SUBSIDIARIES HAVE VARIOUS ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, PRIMARILY RECEIVABLES AND PAYABLES, THAT ARE DENOMINATED IN CURRENCIES OTHER THAN THEIR FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY. THESE BALANCE SHEET ITEMS ARE SUBJECT TO REMEASUREMENT, THE IMPACT

OF WHICH IS RECORDED IN OTHER (INCOME) EXPENSE, NET, WITHIN OUR CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF INCOME.

ACCOUNTING FOR

DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES

THE COMPANY USES DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS TO LIMIT EXPOSURE TO CHANGES IN

FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES AND INTEREST RATES. ALL DERIVATIVES ARE RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE ON THE BALANCE SHEET AND CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS ARE EITHER RECOGNIZED IN OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (A COMPONENT OF

SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY), DEBT OR NET INCOME DEPENDING ON THE NATURE OF THE UNDERLYING EXPOSURE, WHETHER THE DERIVATIVE IS FORMALLY DESIGNATED AS A HEDGE, AND, IF DESIGNATED, THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE HEDGE IS EFFECTIVE. THE COMPANY CLASSIFIES THE

CASH FLOWS AT SETTLEMENT FROM DERIVATIVES IN THE SAME CATEGORY AS THE CASH FLOWS FROM THE RELATED HEDGED ITEMS. FOR UNDESIGNATED HEDGES AND DESIGNATED CASH FLOW HEDGES, THIS IS WITHIN THE CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATIONS COMPONENT OF THE CONSOLIDATED

STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS. FOR DESIGNATED NET INVESTMENT HEDGES, THIS IS GENERALLY WITHIN THE CASH USED BY INVESTING ACTIVITIES COMPONENT OF THE CASH FLOW STATEMENT. AS OUR FAIR VALUE HEDGES ARE RECEIVE-FIXED, PAY-VARIABLE INTEREST RATE SWAPS, THE

CASH FLOWS ASSOCIATED WITH THESE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS ARE PERIODIC INTEREST PAYMENTS WHILE THE SWAPS ARE OUTSTANDING, WHICH ARE REFLECTED IN NET INCOME WITHIN THE CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATIONS COMPONENT OF THE CASH FLOW STATEMENT.

SEE NOTE 18  RISK MANAGEMENT AND DERIVATIVES FOR MORE INFORMATION ON THE COMPANYS RISK MANAGEMENT PROGRAM AND DERIVATIVES.

STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION

THE COMPANY ESTIMATES THE FAIR VALUE OF OPTIONS GRANTED UNDER THE NIKE, INC. 1990 STOCK INCENTIVE PLAN (THE 1990 PLAN) AND

EMPLOYEES PURCHASE RIGHTS UNDER THE EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLANS (ESPPS) USING THE BLACK-SCHOLES OPTION PRICING MODEL. THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES THIS FAIR VALUE, NET OF ESTIMATED FORFEITURES, AS SELLING AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE IN

THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME OVER THE VESTING PERIOD USING THE STRAIGHT-LINE METHOD.

SEE NOTE 11  COMMON STOCK

AND STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION FOR MORE INFORMATION ON THE COMPANYS STOCK PROGRAMS.

INCOME TAXES

THE COMPANY ACCOUNTS FOR INCOME TAXES USING THE ASSET AND LIABILITY METHOD. THIS APPROACH REQUIRES THE RECOGNITION OF

DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES FOR THE EXPECTED FUTURE TAX CONSEQUENCES OF TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE CARRYING AMOUNTS AND THE TAX BASIS OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. UNITED STATES INCOME TAXES ARE PROVIDED CURRENTLY ON FINANCIAL STATEMENT

EARNINGS OF NON-U.S. SUBSIDIARIES THAT ARE EXPECTED TO BE REPATRIATED. THE COMPANY DETERMINES ANNUALLY THE AMOUNT OF UNDISTRIBUTED NON-U.S. EARNINGS TO INVEST INDEFINITELY IN ITS NON-U.S. OPERATIONS. THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES INTEREST AND PENALTIES

RELATED TO INCOME TAX MATTERS IN INCOME TAX EXPENSE.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

NIKE, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (CONTINUED)

SEE NOTE 9  INCOME TAXES FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION.

EARNINGS PER SHARE

BASIC EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE IS CALCULATED BY DIVIDING NET INCOME BY THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE NUMBER OF COMMON SHARES OUTSTANDING DURING

THE YEAR. DILUTED EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE IS CALCULATED BY ADJUSTING WEIGHTED AVERAGE OUTSTANDING SHARES, ASSUMING CONVERSION OF ALL POTENTIALLY DILUTIVE STOCK OPTIONS AND AWARDS.

SEE NOTE 12  EARNINGS PER SHARE FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION.

MANAGEMENT ESTIMATES

THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN CONFORMITY WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO MAKE ESTIMATES,

INCLUDING ESTIMATES RELATING TO ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AND DISCLOSURE OF CONTINGENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AT THE DATE OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF REVENUES AND EXPENSES DURING

THE REPORTING PERIOD. ACTUAL RESULTS COULD DIFFER FROM THESE ESTIMATES.

RECLASSIFICATIONS

CERTAIN PRIOR YEAR AMOUNTS HAVE BEEN RECLASSIFIED TO CONFORM TO FISCAL YEAR 2010 PRESENTATION, INCLUDING A RECLASSIFICATION TO INVESTING

ACTIVITIES FOR THE SETTLEMENT OF NET INVESTMENT HEDGES IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS FOR THE YEAR ENDED MAY 31, 2008. THESE RECLASSIFICATIONS HAD NO IMPACT ON PREVIOUSLY REPORTED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY

AND DO NOT AFFECT PREVIOUSLY REPORTED CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS, FINANCING ACTIVITIES OR NET CHANGE IN CASH AND EQUIVALENTS.

RECENTLY ADOPTED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS.

IN JANUARY 2010, THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD (FASB) ISSUED GUIDANCE TO AMEND THE DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS RELATED

TO RECURRING AND NONRECURRING FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS. THE GUIDANCE REQUIRES ADDITIONAL DISCLOSURES ABOUT THE DIFFERENT CLASSES OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE, THE VALUATION TECHNIQUES AND INPUTS USED, THE ACTIVITY IN LEVEL 3 FAIR

VALUE MEASUREMENTS, AND THE TRANSFERS BETWEEN LEVELS 1, 2, AND 3 OF THE FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT HIERARCHY. THIS GUIDANCE BECAME EFFECTIVE FOR THE COMPANY BEGINNING MARCH 1, 2010, EXCEPT FOR DISCLOSURES RELATING TO PURCHASES, SALES, ISSUANCES AND

SETTLEMENTS OF LEVEL 3 ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, WHICH WILL BE EFFECTIVE FOR THE COMPANY BEGINNING JUNE 1, 2011. AS THIS GUIDANCE ONLY REQUIRES EXPANDED DISCLOSURES, THE ADOPTION DID NOT AND WILL NOT IMPACT THE COMPANYS CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL POSITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. SEE NOTE 6  FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS FOR DISCLOSURE REQUIRED UNDER THIS GUIDANCE.

IN FEBRUARY 2010, THE FASB ISSUED AMENDED GUIDANCE ON SUBSEQUENT EVENTS. UNDER THIS AMENDED GUIDANCE, SEC FILERS ARE NO LONGER REQUIRED

TO DISCLOSE THE DATE THROUGH WHICH SUBSEQUENT EVENTS HAVE BEEN EVALUATED IN ORIGINALLY ISSUED AND REVISED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. THIS GUIDANCE WAS EFFECTIVE IMMEDIATELY AND THE COMPANY ADOPTED THESE NEW REQUIREMENTS SINCE THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL

2010.

IN JUNE 2009, THE FASB ESTABLISHED THE FASB ACCOUNTING STANDARDS CODIFICATION (THE CODIFICATION) AS THE

SINGLE SOURCE OF AUTHORITATIVE U.S. GAAP FOR ALL NON-GOVERNMENTAL ENTITIES. THE CODIFICATION, WHICH LAUNCHED JULY 1, 2009, CHANGES THE REFERENCING AND ORGANIZATION OF ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE. THE CODIFICATION BECAME EFFECTIVE FOR THE COMPANY

BEGINNING SEPTEMBER 1, 2009. THE ISSUANCE OF THE FASB CODIFICATION DID NOT CHANGE GAAP AND THEREFORE THE ADOPTION HAS ONLY AFFECTED HOW SPECIFIC REFERENCES TO GAAP LITERATURE ARE DISCLOSED IN THE NOTES TO THE COMPANYS CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

64

TABLE OF CONTENTS

NIKE, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (CONTINUED)

IN APRIL 2009, THE FASB UPDATED GUIDANCE RELATED TO FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS TO CLARIFY

THE GUIDANCE RELATED TO MEASURING FAIR VALUE IN INACTIVE MARKETS, TO MODIFY THE RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT OF OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENTS OF DEBT SECURITIES, AND TO REQUIRE PUBLIC COMPANIES TO DISCLOSE THE FAIR VALUES OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

IN INTERIM PERIODS. THIS UPDATED GUIDANCE BECAME EFFECTIVE FOR THE COMPANY BEGINNING JUNE 1, 2009. THE ADOPTION OF THIS GUIDANCE DID NOT HAVE AN IMPACT ON THE COMPANYS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL POSITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. SEE NOTE 6

 FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS FOR DISCLOSURE REQUIRED UNDER THE UPDATED GUIDANCE.

IN JUNE 2008, THE FASB ISSUED NEW

ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE APPLICABLE WHEN DETERMINING WHETHER INSTRUMENTS GRANTED IN SHARE-BASED PAYMENT TRANSACTIONS ARE PARTICIPATING SECURITIES. THIS GUIDANCE CLARIFIES THAT SHARE-BASED PAYMENT AWARDS THAT ENTITLE THEIR HOLDERS TO RECEIVE

NON-FORFEITABLE DIVIDENDS BEFORE VESTING SHOULD BE CONSIDERED PARTICIPATING SECURITIES AND INCLUDED IN THE COMPUTATION OF EARNINGS PER SHARE PURSUANT TO THE TWO-CLASS METHOD. THIS GUIDANCE BECAME EFFECTIVE FOR THE COMPANY BEGINNING JUNE 1,

2009. THE ADOPTION OF THIS GUIDANCE DID NOT HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE COMPANYS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL POSITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

IN APRIL 2008, THE FASB ISSUED AMENDED GUIDANCE REGARDING THE DETERMINATION OF THE USEFUL LIFE OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS. THIS GUIDANCE

AMENDS THE FACTORS THAT SHOULD BE CONSIDERED IN DEVELOPING RENEWAL OR EXTENSION ASSUMPTIONS USED TO DETERMINE THE USEFUL LIFE OF A RECOGNIZED INTANGIBLE ASSET. THE INTENT OF THE POSITION IS TO IMPROVE THE CONSISTENCY BETWEEN THE USEFUL LIFE OF A

RECOGNIZED INTANGIBLE ASSET AND THE PERIOD OF EXPECTED CASH FLOWS USED TO MEASURE THE FAIR VALUE OF THE ASSET. THIS GUIDANCE BECAME EFFECTIVE FOR THE COMPANY BEGINNING JUNE 1, 2009. THE ADOPTION OF THIS GUIDANCE DID NOT HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT

ON THE COMPANYS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL POSITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

IN DECEMBER 2007, THE FASB ISSUED AMENDED

GUIDANCE REGARDING BUSINESS COMBINATIONS, ESTABLISHING PRINCIPLES AND REQUIREMENTS FOR HOW AN ACQUIRER RECOGNIZES AND MEASURES IDENTIFIABLE ASSETS ACQUIRED, LIABILITIES ASSUMED, ANY RESULTING GOODWILL, AND ANY NON-CONTROLLING INTEREST IN AN ACQUIREE

IN ITS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. THIS GUIDANCE ALSO PROVIDES FOR DISCLOSURES TO ENABLE USERS OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS TO EVALUATE THE NATURE AND FINANCIAL EFFECTS OF A BUSINESS COMBINATION. THIS AMENDED GUIDANCE BECAME EFFECTIVE FOR THE COMPANY

BEGINNING JUNE 1, 2009. THE ADOPTION OF THIS AMENDED GUIDANCE DID NOT HAVE AN IMPACT ON THE COMPANYS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, BUT COULD IMPACT THE ACCOUNTING FOR FUTURE BUSINESS COMBINATIONS.

IN DECEMBER 2007, THE FASB ISSUED NEW GUIDANCE REGARDING THE ACCOUNTING AND REPORTING FOR NON-CONTROLLING INTERESTS IN SUBSIDIARIES. THIS

GUIDANCE CLARIFIES THAT NON-CONTROLLING INTERESTS IN SUBSIDIARIES SHOULD BE ACCOUNTED FOR AS A COMPONENT OF EQUITY SEPARATE FROM THE PARENTS EQUITY. THIS GUIDANCE BECAME EFFECTIVE FOR THE COMPANY BEGINNING JUNE 1, 2009. THE ADOPTION OF

THIS GUIDANCE DID NOT HAVE AN IMPACT ON THE COMPANYS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL POSITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS.

IN OCTOBER 2009, THE FASB ISSUED NEW STANDARDS THAT REVISED THE GUIDANCE FOR REVENUE RECOGNITION WITH MULTIPLE DELIVERABLES. THESE

NEW STANDARDS IMPACT THE DETERMINATION OF WHEN THE INDIVIDUAL DELIVERABLES INCLUDED IN A MULTIPLE-ELEMENT ARRANGEMENT MAY BE TREATED AS SEPARATE UNITS OF ACCOUNTING. ADDITIONALLY, THESE NEW STANDARDS MODIFY THE MANNER IN WHICH THE TRANSACTION

CONSIDERATION IS ALLOCATED ACROSS THE SEPARATELY IDENTIFIED DELIVERABLES BY NO LONGER PERMITTING THE RESIDUAL METHOD OF ALLOCATING ARRANGEMENT CONSIDERATION. THESE NEW STANDARDS ARE EFFECTIVE FOR THE COMPANY BEGINNING JUNE 1, 2011. THE COMPANY

DOES NOT EXPECT THE ADOPTION WILL HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON ITS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL POSITIONS OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

IN

JUNE 2009, THE FASB ISSUED A NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARD THAT REVISED THE GUIDANCE FOR THE CONSOLIDATION OF VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES (VIE). THIS NEW GUIDANCE REQUIRES A QUALITATIVE APPROACH TO IDENTIFYING A CONTROLLING FINANCIAL INTEREST

IN A VIE, AND REQUIRES AN ONGOING ASSESSMENT OF WHETHER AN ENTITY IS A VIE AND WHETHER AN

65

TABLE OF CONTENTS

INTEREST IN A VIE MAKES THE HOLDER THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY OF THE VIE. THIS GUIDANCE IS EFFECTIVE FOR THE COMPANY BEGINNING JUNE 1, 2010. THE COMPANY IS CURRENTLY EVALUATING THE IMPACT OF

THE PROVISIONS OF THIS NEW STANDARD.

NOTE 4  ACQUISITION, IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS, GOODWILL AND UMBRO IMPAIRMENT

ACQUISITION

ON MARCH 3, 2008, THE COMPANY COMPLETED ITS ACQUISITION OF 100% OF THE OUTSTANDING SHARES OF UMBRO, A LEADING UNITED KINGDOM-BASED

GLOBAL SOCCER BRAND, FOR A PURCHASE PRICE OF 290.5 MILLION BRITISH POUNDS STERLING IN CASH (APPROXIMATELY $576.4 MILLION), INCLUSIVE OF DIRECT TRANSACTION COSTS. THIS ACQUISITION IS INTENDED TO STRENGTHEN THE COMPANYS MARKET POSITION IN

THE UNITED KINGDOM AND EXPAND NIKES GLOBAL LEADERSHIP IN SOCCER, A KEY AREA OF GROWTH FOR THE COMPANY. THIS ACQUISITION ALSO PROVIDES POSITIONS IN EMERGING SOCCER MARKETS SUCH AS CHINA, RUSSIA AND BRAZIL. THE RESULTS OF UMBROS OPERATIONS

HAVE BEEN INCLUDED IN THE COMPANYS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SINCE THE DATE OF ACQUISITION AS PART OF THE COMPANYS OTHER OPERATING SEGMENT.

THE ACQUISITION OF UMBRO WAS ACCOUNTED FOR AS A PURCHASE BUSINESS COMBINATION. THE PURCHASE PRICE WAS ALLOCATED TO TANGIBLE AND

IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS ACQUIRED AND LIABILITIES ASSUMED BASED ON THEIR RESPECTIVE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUES ON THE DATE OF ACQUISITION, WITH THE REMAINING PURCHASE PRICE RECORDED AS GOODWILL.

BASED ON OUR PRELIMINARY PURCHASE PRICE ALLOCATION AT MAY 31, 2008, IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND GOODWILL RELATING TO THE

PURCHASE APPROXIMATED $419.5 MILLION AND $319.2 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. GOODWILL RECOGNIZED IN THIS TRANSACTION IS DEDUCTIBLE FOR TAX PURPOSES. IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS INCLUDE $378.4 MILLION FOR TRADEMARKS THAT HAVE AN INDEFINITE LIFE, AND

$41.1 MILLION FOR OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS CONSISTING OF UMBROS

SOURCING NETWORK, ESTABLISHED CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIPS, AND THE UNITED SOCCER LEAGUE FRANCHISE. THESE INTANGIBLE ASSETS ARE AMORTIZED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER ESTIMATED LIVES OF 12 TO 20

YEARS.

DURING FISCAL 2009, THE COMPANY FINALIZED THE PURCHASE-PRICE ACCOUNTING FOR UMBRO AND MADE REVISIONS TO PRELIMINARY

ESTIMATES, INCLUDING VALUATIONS OF TANGIBLE AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND CERTAIN CONTINGENCIES, AS FURTHER EVALUATIONS WERE COMPLETED AND INFORMATION WAS RECEIVED FROM THIRD PARTIES SUBSEQUENT TO THE ACQUISITION DATE. THESE REVISIONS TO PRELIMINARY

ESTIMATES RESULTED IN A $12.4 MILLION DECREASE IN THE VALUE OF IDENTIFIED INTANGIBLE ASSETS, PRIMARILY UMBROS SOURCING NETWORK, AND AN $11.2 MILLION INCREASE IN NON-CURRENT LIABILITIES, PRIMARILY RELATED TO LIABILITIES ASSUMED FOR CERTAIN

CONTINGENCIES AND ADJUSTMENTS MADE TO DEFERRED TAXES RELATED TO THE FAIR VALUE OF ASSETS ACQUIRED. THESE CHANGES IN ASSETS ACQUIRED AND LIABILITIES ASSUMED AFFECTED THE AMOUNT OF GOODWILL RECORDED.

THE FOLLOWING TABLE SUMMARIZES THE ALLOCATION OF THE PURCHASE PRICE, INCLUDING TRANSACTION COSTS OF THE ACQUISITION, TO THE ASSETS

THE COMPANY PERFORMS ANNUAL IMPAIRMENT TESTS ON GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS WITH INDEFINITE LIVES IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF EACH FISCAL

YEAR, OR WHEN EVENTS OCCUR OR CIRCUMSTANCES CHANGE THAT WOULD, MORE LIKELY THAN NOT, REDUCE THE FAIR VALUE OF A REPORTING UNIT OR INTANGIBLE ASSETS WITH AN INDEFINITE LIFE BELOW ITS CARRYING VALUE. AS A RESULT OF A SIGNIFICANT DECLINE IN GLOBAL

CONSUMER DEMAND AND CONTINUED WEAKNESS IN THE MACROECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT, AS WELL AS DECISIONS BY COMPANY MANAGEMENT TO ADJUST PLANNED INVESTMENT IN THE UMBRO BRAND, THE COMPANY CONCLUDED SUFFICIENT INDICATORS OF IMPAIRMENT EXISTED TO REQUIRE THE

PERFORMANCE OF AN INTERIM ASSESSMENT OF UMBROS GOODWILL AND INDEFINITE LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS AS OF FEBRUARY 1, 2009. ACCORDINGLY, THE COMPANY PERFORMED THE FIRST STEP OF THE GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT ASSESSMENT FOR UMBRO BY COMPARING THE

ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF UMBRO TO ITS CARRYING AMOUNT, AND DETERMINED THERE WAS A POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT OF GOODWILL AS THE CARRYING AMOUNT EXCEEDED THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE. THEREFORE, THE COMPANY PERFORMED THE SECOND STEP OF THE ASSESSMENT WHICH

COMPARED THE IMPLIED FAIR VALUE OF UMBROS GOODWILL TO THE BOOK VALUE OF GOODWILL. THE IMPLIED FAIR VALUE OF GOODWILL IS DETERMINED BY ALLOCATING THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF UMBRO TO ALL OF ITS ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, INCLUDING BOTH RECOGNIZED

AND UNRECOGNIZED INTANGIBLES, IN THE SAME MANNER AS GOODWILL WAS DETERMINED IN THE ORIGINAL BUSINESS COMBINATION.

THE COMPANY

MEASURED THE FAIR VALUE OF UMBRO BY USING AN EQUAL WEIGHTING OF THE FAIR VALUE IMPLIED BY A DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW ANALYSIS AND BY COMPARISONS WITH THE MARKET VALUES OF SIMILAR PUBLICLY TRADED COMPANIES. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THE BLENDED USE OF BOTH

MODELS COMPENSATES FOR THE INHERENT RISK ASSOCIATED WITH EITHER

MODEL IF USED ON A STAND-ALONE BASIS, AND THIS COMBINATION IS INDICATIVE OF THE FACTORS A MARKET PARTICIPANT WOULD CONSIDER WHEN PERFORMING A SIMILAR VALUATION. THE FAIR VALUE OF UMBROS

INDEFINITE-LIVED TRADEMARK WAS ESTIMATED USING THE RELIEF FROM ROYALTY METHOD, WHICH ASSUMES THAT THE TRADEMARK HAS VALUE TO THE EXTENT THAT UMBRO IS RELIEVED OF THE OBLIGATION TO PAY ROYALTIES FOR THE BENEFITS RECEIVED FROM THE TRADEMARK. THE

ASSESSMENTS OF THE COMPANY RESULTED IN THE RECOGNITION OF IMPAIRMENT CHARGES OF $199.3 MILLION AND $181.3 MILLION RELATED TO UMBROS GOODWILL AND TRADEMARK, RESPECTIVELY, FOR THE YEAR ENDED MAY 31, 2009. A TAX BENEFIT OF $54.5 MILLION WAS

RECOGNIZED AS A RESULT OF THE TRADEMARK IMPAIRMENT CHARGE. IN ADDITION TO THE ABOVE IMPAIRMENT ANALYSIS, THE COMPANY DETERMINED AN EQUITY INVESTMENT HELD BY UMBRO WAS IMPAIRED, AND RECOGNIZED A CHARGE OF $20.7 MILLION RELATED TO THE IMPAIRMENT OF

THIS INVESTMENT. THESE CHARGES ARE INCLUDED IN THE COMPANYS OTHER CATEGORY FOR SEGMENT REPORTING PURPOSES.

THE DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW ANALYSIS CALCULATED THE FAIR VALUE OF UMBRO USING MANAGEMENTS BUSINESS PLANS AND PROJECTIONS AS THE BASIS

FOR EXPECTED CASH FLOWS FOR THE NEXT 12 YEARS AND A 3% RESIDUAL GROWTH RATE THEREAFTER. THE COMPANY USED A WEIGHTED AVERAGE DISCOUNT RATE OF 14% IN ITS ANALYSIS, WHICH WAS DERIVED PRIMARILY FROM PUBLISHED SOURCES AS WELL AS OUR ADJUSTMENT FOR

INCREASED MARKET RISK GIVEN CURRENT MARKET CONDITIONS. OTHER SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES USED IN THE DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW ANALYSIS INCLUDE THE RATES OF PROJECTED GROWTH AND PROFITABILITY OF UMBROS BUSINESS AND WORKING CAPITAL EFFECTS. THE MARKET

VALUATION APPROACH INDICATES THE FAIR VALUE OF UMBRO BASED ON A COMPARISON OF UMBRO TO PUBLICLY TRADED COMPANIES IN SIMILAR LINES OF BUSINESS. SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES IN THE MARKET VALUATION APPROACH INCLUDE IDENTIFYING SIMILAR COMPANIES WITH

COMPARABLE BUSINESS FACTORS SUCH AS SIZE, GROWTH, PROFITABILITY, MIX OF REVENUE GENERATED FROM LICENSED AND DIRECT DISTRIBUTION, AND RISK OF RETURN ON INVESTMENT.

HOLDING ALL OTHER ASSUMPTIONS CONSTANT AT THE TEST DATE, A 100 BASIS POINT INCREASE IN THE DISCOUNT RATE WOULD REDUCE THE ADJUSTED

CARRYING VALUE OF UMBROS NET ASSETS BY AN ADDITIONAL 12%.

NOTE 6  FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

THE COMPANY MEASURES CERTAIN FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AT FAIR VALUE ON A RECURRING BASIS, INCLUDING DERIVATIVES AND

AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE SECURITIES. FAIR VALUE IS A MARKET-BASED MEASUREMENT THAT SHOULD BE DETERMINED BASED ON THE ASSUMPTIONS THAT MARKET PARTICIPANTS WOULD USE IN PRICING AN ASSET OR LIABILITY. AS A BASIS FOR CONSIDERING SUCH ASSUMPTIONS, THE

COMPANY USES A THREE-LEVEL HIERARCHY ESTABLISHED BY THE FASB WHICH PRIORITIZES FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS BASED ON THE TYPES OF INPUTS USED FOR THE VARIOUS VALUATION TECHNIQUES (MARKET APPROACH, INCOME APPROACH, AND COST APPROACH).

THE LEVELS OF HIERARCHY ARE DESCRIBED BELOW.



LEVEL 1: OBSERVABLE INPUTS SUCH AS QUOTED PRICES IN ACTIVE MARKETS FOR IDENTICAL ASSETS OR LIABILITIES.



LEVEL 2: INPUTS OTHER THAN QUOTED PRICES THAT ARE OBSERVABLE FOR THE ASSET OR LIABILITY, EITHER DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY; THESE INCLUDE QUOTED

PRICES FOR SIMILAR ASSETS OR LIABILITIES IN ACTIVE MARKETS AND QUOTED PRICES FOR IDENTICAL OR SIMILAR ASSETS OR LIABILITIES IN MARKETS THAT ARE NOT ACTIVE.



LEVEL 3: UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS IN WHICH THERE IS LITTLE OR NO MARKET DATA AVAILABLE, WHICH REQUIRE THE REPORTING ENTITY TO DEVELOP ITS OWN

ASSUMPTIONS.

THE COMPANYS ASSESSMENT OF THE SIGNIFICANCE OF A PARTICULAR INPUT TO THE FAIR VALUE

MEASUREMENT IN ITS ENTIRETY REQUIRES JUDGMENT AND CONSIDERS FACTORS SPECIFIC TO THE ASSET OR LIABILITY. FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE CLASSIFIED IN THEIR ENTIRETY BASED ON THE MOST STRINGENT LEVEL OF INPUT THAT IS SIGNIFICANT TO THE FAIR

VALUE MEASUREMENT.

DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS INCLUDE FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARDS, OPTION CONTRACTS AND INTEREST

RATE SWAPS. THE FAIR VALUE OF THESE DERIVATIVES CONTRACTS IS DETERMINED USING OBSERVABLE MARKET INPUTS SUCH AS THE FORWARD PRICING CURVE, CURRENCY VOLATILITIES, CURRENCY CORRELATIONS AND INTEREST RATES, AND CONSIDERS NONPERFORMANCE RISK OF THE

COMPANY AND THAT OF ITS COUNTERPARTIES. ADJUSTMENTS RELATING TO THESE RISKS WERE NOT MATERIAL FOR THE YEARS ENDED MAY 31, 2010 AND 2009.

AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE SECURITIES ARE PRIMARILY COMPRISED OF INVESTMENTS IN U.S. TREASURY AND AGENCY SECURITIES, COMMERCIAL PAPER, BONDS AND

MONEY MARKET FUNDS. THESE SECURITIES ARE VALUED USING MARKET PRICES ON BOTH ACTIVE MARKETS (LEVEL 1) AND LESS ACTIVE MARKETS (LEVEL 2). LEVEL 1 INSTRUMENT VALUATIONS ARE OBTAINED FROM REAL-TIME QUOTES FOR TRANSACTIONS IN ACTIVE EXCHANGE

MARKETS INVOLVING IDENTICAL ASSETS. LEVEL 2 INSTRUMENT VALUATIONS ARE OBTAINED FROM READILY-AVAILABLE PRICING SOURCES FOR COMPARABLE INSTRUMENTS.

AS OF MAY 31, 2010 AND 2009, THE COMPANY HAD NO MATERIAL LEVEL 3 MEASUREMENTS AND NO ASSETS OR LIABILITIES MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE ON A

AS OF MAY 31, 2010, THE TOTAL GROSS UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS, EXCLUDING RELATED INTEREST AND

PENALTIES, WERE $282.1 MILLION, $158.4 MILLION OF WHICH WOULD AFFECT THE COMPANYS EFFECTIVE TAX RATE IF RECOGNIZED IN FUTURE PERIODS. TOTAL GROSS UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS, EXCLUDING INTEREST AND PENALTIES, AS OF MAY 31, 2009 WAS $273.9

MILLION, $110.6 MILLION OF WHICH WOULD AFFECT THE COMPANYS EFFECTIVE TAX RATE IF RECOGNIZED IN FUTURE PERIODS.

THE

COMPANY RECOGNIZES INTEREST AND PENALTIES RELATED TO INCOME TAX MATTERS IN INCOME TAX EXPENSE. THE LIABILITY FOR PAYMENT OF INTEREST AND PENALTIES INCREASED $6.0 MILLION, $2.2 MILLION AND $41.2 MILLION DURING THE YEARS ENDED MAY 31, 2010, 2009

AND 2008, RESPECTIVELY. AS OF MAY 31, 2010 AND 2009, ACCRUED INTEREST AND PENALTIES RELATED TO UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS WAS $81.4 MILLION AND $75.4 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY (EXCLUDING FEDERAL BENEFIT).

THE COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO TAXATION PRIMARILY IN THE U.S., CHINA AND THE NETHERLANDS AS WELL AS VARIOUS STATE AND OTHER FOREIGN

JURISDICTIONS. THE COMPANY HAS CONCLUDED SUBSTANTIALLY ALL U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX MATTERS THROUGH FISCAL YEAR 2006. THE COMPANY IS CURRENTLY UNDER AUDIT BY THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE FOR THE 2007, 2008, 2009 AND 2010 TAX YEARS. THE COMPANYS

MAJOR FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS, CHINA AND THE NETHERLANDS, HAVE CONCLUDED SUBSTANTIALLY ALL INCOME TAX MATTERS THROUGH CALENDAR 1999 AND FISCAL 2003, RESPECTIVELY. IT IS REASONABLY POSSIBLE THAT THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE AUDITS FOR THE 2007, 2008

AND 2009 TAX YEARS WILL BE COMPLETED DURING THE NEXT 12 MONTHS, WHICH COULD RESULT IN A DECREASE IN OUR BALANCE OF UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS. AN ESTIMATE OF THE RANGE CANNOT BE MADE AT THIS TIME; HOWEVER, WE DO NOT ANTICIPATE THAT TOTAL GROSS

UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS WILL CHANGE SIGNIFICANTLY AS A RESULT OF FULL OR PARTIAL SETTLEMENT OF AUDITS WITHIN THE NEXT 12 MONTHS.

THE COMPANY HAS INDEFINITELY REINVESTED APPROXIMATELY $3.6 BILLION OF THE CUMULATIVE UNDISTRIBUTED EARNINGS OF CERTAIN FOREIGN

SUBSIDIARIES. SUCH EARNINGS WOULD BE SUBJECT TO U.S. TAXATION IF REPATRIATED TO THE U.S. DETERMINATION OF THE AMOUNT OF UNRECOGNIZED DEFERRED TAX LIABILITY ASSOCIATED WITH THE PERMANENTLY REINVESTED CUMULATIVE UNDISTRIBUTED EARNINGS IS NOT

PRACTICABLE.

DURING THE YEAR ENDED MAY 31, 2009, A PORTION OF THE COMPANYS FOREIGN OPERATIONS WAS GRANTED A TAX

HOLIDAY THAT WILL PHASE OUT IN 2019. THE DECREASE IN INCOME TAX EXPENSE FOR THE YEAR ENDED MAY 31, 2010 AS A RESULT OF THIS ARRANGEMENT WAS APPROXIMATELY $30.1 MILLION ($0.06 PER DILUTED SHARE). THE EFFECT ON INCOME TAX EXPENSE FOR THE YEAR

ENDED MAY 31, 2009 WAS NOT MATERIAL.

DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AT MAY 31, 2010 AND 2009 WERE REDUCED BY A VALUATION ALLOWANCE

RELATING TO TAX BENEFITS OF CERTAIN SUBSIDIARIES WITH OPERATING LOSSES WHERE IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT THE DEFERRED TAX ASSETS WILL NOT BE REALIZED. THE NET CHANGE IN THE VALUATION ALLOWANCE WAS AN INCREASE OF $10.2 MILLION FOR THE YEAR

ENDED MAY 31, 2010 AND A DECREASE OF $14.7 MILLION AND $1.6 MILLION FOR THE YEARS ENDED MAY 31, 2009 AND 2008, RESPECTIVELY.

IN 1990, THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS ADOPTED, AND THE SHAREHOLDERS

APPROVED, THE NIKE, INC. 1990 STOCK INCENTIVE PLAN (THE 1990 PLAN). THE 1990 PLAN PROVIDES FOR THE ISSUANCE OF UP TO 132 MILLION PREVIOUSLY UNISSUED SHARES OF CLASS B COMMON STOCK IN CONNECTION WITH STOCK OPTIONS AND OTHER AWARDS

GRANTED UNDER THE PLAN. THE 1990 PLAN AUTHORIZES THE GRANT OF NON-STATUTORY STOCK OPTIONS, INCENTIVE STOCK OPTIONS, STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS, STOCK BONUSES, AND THE ISSUANCE AND SALE OF RESTRICTED STOCK. THE EXERCISE PRICE FOR NON-STATUTORY STOCK

OPTIONS, STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS AND THE GRANT PRICE OF RESTRICTED STOCK MAY NOT BE LESS THAN 75% OF THE FAIR MARKET VALUE OF THE UNDERLYING SHARES ON THE DATE OF GRANT. THE EXERCISE PRICE FOR INCENTIVE STOCK OPTIONS MAY NOT BE LESS THAN THE FAIR

MARKET VALUE OF THE UNDERLYING SHARES ON THE DATE OF GRANT. A COMMITTEE OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS ADMINISTERS THE 1990 PLAN. THE COMMITTEE HAS THE AUTHORITY TO DETERMINE THE EMPLOYEES TO WHOM AWARDS WILL BE MADE, THE AMOUNT OF THE AWARDS, AND THE

OTHER TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THE AWARDS. THE COMMITTEE HAS GRANTED SUBSTANTIALLY ALL STOCK OPTIONS AT 100% OF THE MARKET PRICE ON THE DATE OF GRANT. SUBSTANTIALLY ALL STOCK OPTION GRANTS OUTSTANDING UNDER THE 1990 PLAN WERE GRANTED IN THE FIRST

QUARTER OF EACH FISCAL YEAR, VEST RATABLY OVER FOUR YEARS, AND EXPIRE 10 YEARS FROM THE DATE OF GRANT. IN JUNE 2010, THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AMENDED THE 1990 PLAN TO REQUIRE, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THAT THE EXERCISE PRICE FOR NON-STATUTORY STOCK OPTIONS

AND STRATEGY FOR UNDERTAKING HEDGE TRANSACTIONS. THIS PROCESS INCLUDES LINKING ALL DERIVATIVES TO EITHER SPECIFIC FIRM COMMITMENTS OR FORECASTED TRANSACTIONS. THE COMPANY ALSO ENTERS INTO FOREIGN EXCHANGE FORWARDS TO MITIGATE THE CHANGE IN FAIR

VALUE OF SPECIFIC ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ON THE BALANCE SHEET, WHICH ARE NOT DESIGNATED AS HEDGING INSTRUMENTS UNDER THE ACCOUNTING STANDARDS FOR DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING. ACCORDINGLY, CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF HEDGES OF RECORDED BALANCE SHEET

POSITIONS ARE RECOGNIZED

CASH FLOW HEDGES

THE PURPOSE OF THE COMPANYS FOREIGN CURRENCY HEDGING ACTIVITIES IS TO PROTECT THE COMPANY FROM THE RISK THAT THE EVENTUAL CASH FLOWS

RESULTING FROM TRANSACTIONS IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES, INCLUDING REVENUES, PRODUCT COSTS, SELLING AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES, INVESTMENTS IN U.S. DOLLAR-DENOMINATED AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE DEBT SECURITIES AND INTERCOMPANY TRANSACTIONS, INCLUDING

INTERCOMPANY BORROWINGS, WILL BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY CHANGES IN EXCHANGE RATES. IT IS THE COMPANYS POLICY TO UTILIZE DERIVATIVES TO REDUCE FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISKS WHERE INTERNAL NETTING STRATEGIES CANNOT BE EFFECTIVELY EMPLOYED. HEDGED

TRANSACTIONS ARE DENOMINATED PRIMARILY IN EUROS, BRITISH POUNDS AND JAPANESE YEN. THE COMPANY HEDGES UP TO 100% OF ANTICIPATED EXPOSURES TYPICALLY 12 MONTHS IN ADVANCE, BUT HAS HEDGED AS MUCH AS 34 MONTHS IN ADVANCE.

ALL CHANGES IN FAIR VALUES OF OUTSTANDING CASH FLOW HEDGE DERIVATIVES, EXCEPT THE INEFFECTIVE PORTION, ARE RECORDED IN OTHER

COMPREHENSIVE INCOME UNTIL NET INCOME IS AFFECTED BY THE VARIABILITY OF CASH FLOWS OF THE HEDGED TRANSACTION. IN MOST CASES, AMOUNTS RECORDED IN OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME WILL BE RELEASED TO NET INCOME SOME TIME AFTER THE MATURITY OF THE RELATED

DERIVATIVE. THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF INCOME CLASSIFICATION OF EFFECTIVE HEDGE RESULTS IS THE SAME AS THAT OF THE UNDERLYING EXPOSURE. RESULTS OF HEDGES OF REVENUE AND PRODUCT COSTS ARE RECORDED IN REVENUE AND COST OF SALES, RESPECTIVELY, WHEN

THE UNDERLYING HEDGED TRANSACTION AFFECTS NET INCOME. RESULTS OF HEDGES OF SELLING AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE ARE RECORDED TOGETHER WITH THOSE COSTS WHEN THE RELATED EXPENSE IS RECORDED. RESULTS OF HEDGES OF ANTICIPATED PURCHASES AND SALES OF U.S.

DOLLAR-DENOMINATED AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE SECURITIES ARE RECORDED IN OTHER (INCOME) EXPENSE, NET WHEN THE SECURITIES ARE SOLD. RESULTS OF HEDGES OF ANTICIPATED INTERCOMPANY TRANSACTIONS ARE RECORDED IN OTHER (INCOME) EXPENSE, NET WHEN THE TRANSACTION

OCCURS. THE COMPANY CLASSIFIES THE CASH FLOWS AT SETTLEMENT FROM THESE DESIGNATED CASH FLOW HEDGE DERIVATIVES IN THE SAME CATEGORY AS THE CASH FLOWS FROM THE RELATED HEDGED ITEMS, GENERALLY WITHIN THE CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATIONS COMPONENT OF THE

CASH FLOW STATEMENT.

PREMIUMS PAID ON OPTIONS ARE INITIALLY RECORDED AS DEFERRED CHARGES. THE COMPANY ASSESSES THE

EFFECTIVENESS OF OPTIONS BASED ON THE TOTAL CASH FLOWS METHOD AND RECORDS TOTAL CHANGES IN THE OPTIONS FAIR VALUE TO OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME TO THE DEGREE THEY ARE EFFECTIVE.

AS OF MAY 31, 2010, $187.2 MILLION OF DEFERRED NET GAINS (NET OF TAX) ON BOTH OUTSTANDING AND MATURED DERIVATIVES ACCUMULATED IN

OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME ARE EXPECTED TO BE RECLASSIFIED TO NET INCOME DURING THE NEXT 12 MONTHS AS A RESULT OF UNDERLYING HEDGED TRANSACTIONS ALSO BEING RECORDED IN NET INCOME. ACTUAL AMOUNTS ULTIMATELY RECLASSIFIED TO NET INCOME ARE DEPENDENT ON

THE EXCHANGE RATES IN EFFECT WHEN DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS THAT ARE CURRENTLY OUTSTANDING MATURE. AS OF MAY 31, 2010, THE MAXIMUM TERM OVER WHICH THE COMPANY IS HEDGING EXPOSURES TO THE VARIABILITY OF CASH FLOWS FOR ITS FORECASTED AND RECORDED

TRANSACTIONS IS 18 MONTHS.

THE COMPANY FORMALLY ASSESSES BOTH AT A HEDGES INCEPTION AND ON AN ONGOING BASIS, WHETHER

THE DERIVATIVES THAT ARE USED IN THE HEDGING TRANSACTION HAVE BEEN HIGHLY EFFECTIVE IN OFFSETTING CHANGES IN THE CASH FLOWS OF HEDGED ITEMS AND WHETHER THOSE DERIVATIVES MAY BE EXPECTED TO REMAIN HIGHLY EFFECTIVE IN FUTURE PERIODS. EFFECTIVENESS FOR

CASH FLOW HEDGES IS ASSESSED BASED ON FORWARD RATES. WHEN IT IS DETERMINED THAT A DERIVATIVE IS NOT, OR HAS CEASED TO BE, HIGHLY EFFECTIVE AS A HEDGE, THE COMPANY DISCONTINUES HEDGE ACCOUNTING PROSPECTIVELY.

THE COMPANY DISCONTINUES HEDGE ACCOUNTING PROSPECTIVELY WHEN (1) IT DETERMINES THAT THE DERIVATIVE IS NO LONGER HIGHLY EFFECTIVE IN

OFFSETTING CHANGES IN THE CASH FLOWS OF A HEDGED ITEM (INCLUDING HEDGED ITEMS SUCH AS FIRM COMMITMENTS OR FORECASTED TRANSACTIONS); (2) THE DERIVATIVE EXPIRES OR IS SOLD, TERMINATED, OR EXERCISED; (3) IT IS NO LONGER PROBABLE THAT THE

FORECASTED TRANSACTION WILL OCCUR; OR (4) MANAGEMENT DETERMINES THAT DESIGNATING THE DERIVATIVE AS A HEDGING INSTRUMENT IS NO LONGER APPROPRIATE.

86

TABLE OF CONTENTS

NIKE, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (CONTINUED)

WHEN THE COMPANY DISCONTINUES HEDGE ACCOUNTING BECAUSE IT IS NO LONGER PROBABLE THAT THE

FORECASTED TRANSACTION WILL OCCUR IN THE ORIGINALLY EXPECTED PERIOD, OR WITHIN AN ADDITIONAL TWO-MONTH PERIOD OF TIME THEREAFTER, THE GAIN OR LOSS ON THE DERIVATIVE REMAINS IN ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME AND IS RECLASSIFIED TO NET INCOME

WHEN THE FORECASTED TRANSACTION AFFECTS NET INCOME. HOWEVER, IF IT IS PROBABLE THAT A FORECASTED TRANSACTION WILL NOT OCCUR BY THE END OF THE ORIGINALLY SPECIFIED TIME PERIOD OR WITHIN AN ADDITIONAL TWO-MONTH PERIOD OF TIME THEREAFTER, THE GAINS AND

LOSSES THAT WERE ACCUMULATED IN OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME WILL BE RECOGNIZED IMMEDIATELY IN NET INCOME. IN ALL SITUATIONS IN WHICH HEDGE ACCOUNTING IS DISCONTINUED AND THE DERIVATIVE REMAINS OUTSTANDING, THE COMPANY WILL CARRY THE DERIVATIVE AT ITS

FAIR VALUE ON THE BALANCE SHEET, RECOGNIZING FUTURE CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE IN OTHER (INCOME) EXPENSE, NET. FOR THE YEAR ENDED MAY 31, 2010, $5.2 MILLION OF INCOME WAS RECORDED TO OTHER (INCOME) EXPENSE, NET AS A RESULT OF CASH FLOW HEDGE

INEFFECTIVENESS. FOR THE YEARS ENDED 2009 AND 2008, THE COMPANY RECORDED IN OTHER (INCOME) EXPENSE AN IMMATERIAL AMOUNT OF INEFFECTIVENESS FROM CASH FLOW HEDGES.

FAIR VALUE HEDGES

THE COMPANY IS ALSO EXPOSED TO THE RISK OF CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF CERTAIN FIXED-RATE DEBT ATTRIBUTABLE TO CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES.

DERIVATIVES CURRENTLY USED BY THE COMPANY TO HEDGE THIS RISK ARE RECEIVE-FIXED, PAY-VARIABLE INTEREST RATE SWAPS. AS OF MAY 31, 2010, ALL INTEREST RATE SWAP AGREEMENTS ARE DESIGNATED AS FAIR VALUE HEDGES OF THE RELATED LONG-TERM DEBT AND MEET

THE SHORTCUT METHOD REQUIREMENTS UNDER THE ACCOUNTING STANDARDS FOR DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING. ACCORDINGLY, CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUES OF THE INTEREST RATE SWAP AGREEMENTS ARE EXACTLY OFFSET BY CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE UNDERLYING LONG-TERM

DEBT. THE CASH FLOWS ASSOCIATED WITH THE COMPANYS FAIR VALUE HEDGES ARE PERIODIC INTEREST PAYMENTS WHILE THE SWAPS ARE OUTSTANDING, WHICH ARE REFLECTED IN NET INCOME WITHIN THE CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATIONS COMPONENT OF THE CASH FLOW STATEMENT.

NO INEFFECTIVENESS HAS BEEN RECORDED TO NET INCOME RELATED TO INTEREST RATE SWAPS DESIGNATED AS FAIR VALUE HEDGES FOR THE YEARS ENDED MAY 31, 2010, 2009 AND 2008.

IN FISCAL 2003, THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO A RECEIVE-FLOATING, PAY-FIXED INTEREST RATE SWAP AGREEMENT RELATED TO A JAPANESE YEN DENOMINATED

INTERCOMPANY LOAN WITH ONE OF THE COMPANYS JAPANESE SUBSIDIARIES. THIS INTEREST RATE SWAP WAS NOT DESIGNATED AS A HEDGE UNDER THE ACCOUNTING STANDARDS FOR DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING. ACCORDINGLY, CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE SWAP WERE

RECORDED TO NET INCOME EACH PERIOD THROUGH MATURITY AS A COMPONENT OF INTEREST EXPENSE (INCOME), NET. BOTH THE INTERCOMPANY LOAN AND THE RELATED INTEREST RATE SWAP MATURED DURING THE YEAR ENDED MAY 31, 2009.

NET INVESTMENT HEDGES

THE COMPANY ALSO HEDGES THE RISK OF VARIABILITY IN FOREIGN-CURRENCY-DENOMINATED NET INVESTMENTS IN WHOLLY-OWNED INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS.

ALL CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE OF THE DERIVATIVES DESIGNATED AS NET INVESTMENT HEDGES, EXCEPT INEFFECTIVE PORTIONS, ARE REPORTED IN THE CUMULATIVE TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENT COMPONENT OF OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME ALONG WITH THE FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION

ADJUSTMENTS ON THOSE INVESTMENTS. THE COMPANY CLASSIFIES THE CASH FLOWS AT SETTLEMENT OF ITS NET INVESTMENT HEDGES WITHIN THE CASH USED BY INVESTING COMPONENT OF THE CASH FLOW STATEMENT. THE COMPANY ASSESSES HEDGE EFFECTIVENESS BASED ON CHANGES IN

FORWARD RATES. THE COMPANY RECORDED NO INEFFECTIVENESS FROM ITS NET INVESTMENT HEDGES FOR THE YEARS ENDED MAY 31, 2010, 2009, AND 2008.

CREDIT RISK

THE COMPANY IS EXPOSED TO CREDIT-RELATED LOSSES IN THE EVENT OF NON-PERFORMANCE BY COUNTERPARTIES TO HEDGING INSTRUMENTS. THE

COUNTERPARTIES TO ALL DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS ARE MAJOR FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS WITH INVESTMENT GRADE CREDIT RATINGS. HOWEVER, THIS DOES NOT ELIMINATE THE COMPANYS EXPOSURE TO CREDIT RISK WITH

87

TABLE OF CONTENTS

NIKE, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (CONTINUED)

THESE INSTITUTIONS. THIS CREDIT RISK IS LIMITED TO THE UNREALIZED GAINS IN SUCH CONTRACTS SHOULD ANY OF THESE COUNTERPARTIES FAIL TO PERFORM AS CONTRACTED. TO MANAGE THIS RISK, THE COMPANY HAS

ESTABLISHED STRICT COUNTERPARTY CREDIT GUIDELINES THAT ARE CONTINUALLY MONITORED AND REPORTED TO SENIOR MANAGEMENT ACCORDING TO PRESCRIBED GUIDELINES. THE COMPANY UTILIZES A PORTFOLIO OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS EITHER HEADQUARTERED OR OPERATING IN

THE SAME COUNTRIES THE COMPANY CONDUCTS ITS BUSINESS. AS A RESULT OF THE ABOVE CONSIDERATIONS, THE COMPANY CONSIDERS THE IMPACT OF THE RISK OF COUNTERPARTY DEFAULT TO BE IMMATERIAL.

CERTAIN OF THE COMPANYS DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS CONTAIN CREDIT RISK RELATED CONTINGENT FEATURES. AS OF MAY 31, 2010, THE

COMPANY WAS IN COMPLIANCE WITH ALL SUCH CREDIT RISK RELATED CONTINGENT FEATURES. THE AGGREGATE FAIR VALUE OF DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS WITH CREDIT RISK RELATED CONTINGENT FEATURES THAT ARE IN A NET LIABILITY POSITION AT MAY 31, 2010 WAS $18.3

MILLION. THE COMPANY WAS NOT REQUIRED TO POST ANY COLLATERAL AS A RESULT OF THESE CONTINGENT FEATURES.

NOTE 19  OPERATING SEGMENTS

AND RELATED INFORMATION

OPERATING SEGMENTS.

THE COMPANYS OPERATING SEGMENTS ARE

EVIDENCE OF THE STRUCTURE OF THE COMPANYS INTERNAL ORGANIZATION. THE MAJOR SEGMENTS ARE DEFINED BY GEOGRAPHIC REGIONS FOR OPERATIONS PARTICIPATING IN NIKE BRAND SALES ACTIVITY EXCLUDING NIKE GOLF. EACH NIKE BRAND GEOGRAPHIC SEGMENT OPERATES

PREDOMINANTLY IN ONE INDUSTRY: THE DESIGN, PRODUCTION, MARKETING AND SELLING OF SPORTS AND FITNESS FOOTWEAR, APPAREL, AND EQUIPMENT. IN FISCAL 2009, THE COMPANY INITIATED A REORGANIZATION OF THE NIKE BRAND INTO A NEW MODEL CONSISTING OF SIX

GEOGRAPHIES. EFFECTIVE JUNE 1, 2009, THE COMPANYS NEW REPORTABLE OPERATING SEGMENTS FOR THE NIKE BRAND ARE: NORTH AMERICA, WESTERN EUROPE, CENTRAL AND EASTERN EUROPE, GREATER CHINA, JAPAN, AND EMERGING MARKETS. PREVIOUSLY, NIKE BRAND

OPERATIONS WERE ORGANIZED INTO THE FOLLOWING FOUR GEOGRAPHIC REGIONS: U.S., EUROPE, MIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA (COLLECTIVELY, EMEA), ASIA PACIFIC, AND AMERICAS.

THE COMPANYS OTHER CATEGORY IS BROKEN INTO TWO COMPONENTS FOR PRESENTATION PURPOSES TO ALIGN WITH THE WAY MANAGEMENT

VIEWS THE COMPANY. THE GLOBAL BRAND DIVISIONS CATEGORY PRIMARILY REPRESENTS NIKE BRAND LICENSING BUSINESSES THAT ARE NOT PART OF A GEOGRAPHIC OPERATING SEGMENT, SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES THAT ARE CENTRALLY MANAGED FOR

THE NIKE BRAND AND COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT AND SUPPLY CHAIN OPERATIONS. THE OTHER BUSINESSES CATEGORY PRIMARILY CONSISTS OF THE ACTIVITIES OF COLE HAAN, CONVERSE INC., HURLEY INTERNATIONAL LLC, NIKE GOLF AND UMBRO

LTD. ACTIVITIES REPRESENTED IN THE OTHER CATEGORY ARE CONSIDERED IMMATERIAL FOR INDIVIDUAL DISCLOSURE. PRIOR PERIOD AMOUNTS HAVE BEEN RECLASSIFIED TO CONFORM TO THE COMPANYS NEW OPERATING STRUCTURE DESCRIBED ABOVE.

REVENUES AS SHOWN BELOW REPRESENT SALES TO EXTERNAL CUSTOMERS FOR EACH SEGMENT. INTERCOMPANY REVENUES HAVE BEEN ELIMINATED AND ARE

IMMATERIAL FOR SEPARATE DISCLOSURE.

CORPORATE CONSISTS OF UNALLOCATED GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES, WHICH INCLUDES

EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH CENTRALLY MANAGED DEPARTMENTS, DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION RELATED TO THE COMPANYS HEADQUARTERS, UNALLOCATED INSURANCE AND BENEFIT PROGRAMS, INCLUDING STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION, CERTAIN FOREIGN CURRENCY GAINS AND

LOSSES, INCLUDING HEDGE GAINS AND LOSSES, CERTAIN CORPORATE ELIMINATIONS AND OTHER ITEMS.

EFFECTIVE JUNE 1, 2009, THE

PRIMARY FINANCIAL MEASURE USED BY THE COMPANY TO EVALUATE PERFORMANCE OF INDIVIDUAL OPERATING SEGMENTS IS EARNINGS BEFORE INTEREST AND TAXES (COMMONLY REFERRED TO AS EBIT) WHICH REPRESENTS NET INCOME BEFORE INTEREST EXPENSE (INCOME), NET

AND INCOME TAXES IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME. RECONCILING ITEMS FOR EBIT REPRESENT CORPORATE EXPENSE ITEMS THAT ARE NOT ALLOCATED TO THE OPERATING SEGMENTS FOR MANAGEMENT REPORTING. PREVIOUSLY, THE COMPANY EVALUATED PERFORMANCE OF

INDIVIDUAL OPERATING SEGMENTS BASED ON PRE-TAX INCOME OR INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES.

88

TABLE OF CONTENTS

NIKE, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (CONTINUED)

AS PART OF THE COMPANYS CENTRALLY MANAGED FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK MANAGEMENT

PROGRAM, STANDARD FOREIGN CURRENCY RATES ARE ASSIGNED TO EACH NIKE BRAND ENTITY IN OUR GEOGRAPHIC OPERATING SEGMENTS AND ARE USED TO RECORD ANY NON-FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY REVENUES OR PRODUCT PURCHASES INTO THE ENTITYS FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY.

GEOGRAPHIC OPERATING SEGMENT REVENUES AND COST OF SALES REFLECT USE OF THESE STANDARD RATES. FOR ALL NIKE BRAND OPERATING SEGMENTS, DIFFERENCES BETWEEN ASSIGNED STANDARD FOREIGN CURRENCY RATES AND ACTUAL MARKET RATES ARE INCLUDED IN CORPORATE

TOGETHER WITH FOREIGN CURRENCY HEDGE GAINS AND LOSSES GENERATED FROM THE CENTRALLY MANAGED FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK MANAGEMENT PROGRAM AND OTHER CONVERSION GAINS AND LOSSES. FOR THE YEARS ENDED MAY 31, 2009 AND 2008, FOREIGN CURRENCY HEDGE RESULTS

ALONG WITH OTHER CONVERSION GAINS AND LOSSES GENERATED BY THE WESTERN EUROPE AND CENTRAL AND EASTERN EUROPE GEOGRAPHIES WERE RECORDED IN THEIR RESPECTIVE RESULTS.

ADDITIONS TO LONG-LIVED ASSETS AS PRESENTED IN THE FOLLOWING TABLE REPRESENT CAPITAL EXPENDITURES.

ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, INVENTORIES AND PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT FOR OPERATING SEGMENTS ARE REGULARLY REVIEWED BY MANAGEMENT AND ARE

THEREFORE PROVIDED BELOW.

CERTAIN PRIOR YEAR AMOUNTS HAVE BEEN RECLASSIFIED TO CONFORM TO FISCAL 2010 PRESENTATION.
