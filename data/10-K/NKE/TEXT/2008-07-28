BUSINESS

GENERAL

NIKE, INC. WAS INCORPORATED IN 1968 UNDER THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF OREGON. AS USED IN THIS

REPORT, THE TERMS WE, US, NIKE AND THE COMPANY REFER TO NIKE, INC. AND ITS PREDECESSORS, SUBSIDIARIES AND AFFILIATES, UNLESS THE CONTEXT INDICATES OTHERWISE. OUR INTERNET ADDRESS IS

WWW.NIKE.COM.

ON OUR NIKE CORPORATE WEB SITE, LOCATED AT

WWW.NIKEBIZ.COM,

WE POST THE FOLLOWING FILINGS AS SOON AS REASONABLY PRACTICABLE AFTER THEY ARE ELECTRONICALLY FILED WITH OR FURNISHED TO THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION.

OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K, OUR QUARTERLY REPORTS ON FORM 10-Q, OUR CURRENT REPORTS ON FORM 8-K AND ANY AMENDMENTS TO THOSE REPORTS FILED OR FURNISHED PURSUANT TO SECTION 13(A) OR 15(D) OF THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934, AS

AMENDED. ALL SUCH FILINGS ON OUR NIKE CORPORATE WEB SITE ARE AVAILABLE FREE OF CHARGE. ALSO AVAILABLE ON THE NIKE CORPORATE WEB SITE ARE THE CHARTERS OF THE COMMITTEES OF OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS, AS WELL AS OUR CORPORATE GOVERNANCE GUIDELINES AND

CODE OF ETHICS; COPIES OF ANY OF THESE DOCUMENTS WILL BE PROVIDED IN PRINT TO ANY SHAREHOLDER WHO SUBMITS A REQUEST IN WRITING TO NIKE INVESTOR RELATIONS, ONE BOWERMAN DRIVE, BEAVERTON, OREGON 97005-6453.

OUR PRINCIPAL BUSINESS ACTIVITY IS THE DESIGN, DEVELOPMENT AND WORLDWIDE MARKETING OF HIGH QUALITY FOOTWEAR, APPAREL, EQUIPMENT, AND ACCESSORY PRODUCTS.

NIKE IS THE LARGEST SELLER OF ATHLETIC FOOTWEAR AND ATHLETIC APPAREL IN THE WORLD. WE SELL OUR PRODUCTS TO RETAIL ACCOUNTS, THROUGH NIKE-OWNED RETAIL INCLUDING STORES AND INTERNET SALES, AND THROUGH A MIX OF INDEPENDENT DISTRIBUTORS AND LICENSEES,

IN OVER 180 COUNTRIES AROUND THE WORLD. VIRTUALLY ALL OF OUR PRODUCTS ARE MANUFACTURED BY INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS. VIRTUALLY ALL FOOTWEAR AND APPAREL PRODUCTS ARE PRODUCED OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES, WHILE EQUIPMENT PRODUCTS ARE PRODUCED BOTH IN THE

UNITED STATES AND ABROAD.

PRODUCTS

NIKES ATHLETIC FOOTWEAR PRODUCTS ARE DESIGNED PRIMARILY FOR SPECIFIC ATHLETIC USE, ALTHOUGH A LARGE PERCENTAGE OF THE PRODUCTS ARE WORN FOR CASUAL OR LEISURE PURPOSES. WE PLACE CONSIDERABLE EMPHASIS ON HIGH

QUALITY CONSTRUCTION AND INNOVATION IN PRODUCTS DESIGNED FOR MEN, WOMEN AND CHILDREN. RUNNING, TRAINING, BASKETBALL, SOCCER, SPORT-INSPIRED URBAN SHOES, AND CHILDRENS SHOES ARE CURRENTLY OUR TOP-SELLING FOOTWEAR CATEGORIES AND WE EXPECT THEM

TO CONTINUE TO LEAD IN PRODUCT SALES IN THE NEAR FUTURE. WE ALSO MARKET SHOES DESIGNED FOR AQUATIC ACTIVITIES, BASEBALL, BICYCLING, CHEERLEADING, FOOTBALL, GOLF, LACROSSE, OUTDOOR ACTIVITIES, SKATEBOARDING, TENNIS, VOLLEYBALL, WALKING, WRESTLING,

AND OTHER ATHLETIC AND RECREATIONAL USES.

WE SELL SPORTS APPAREL AND ACCESSORIES COVERING MOST OF THE ABOVE CATEGORIES, SPORTS-INSPIRED

LIFESTYLE APPAREL, AS WELL AS ATHLETIC BAGS AND ACCESSORY ITEMS. NIKE APPAREL AND ACCESSORIES ARE DESIGNED TO COMPLEMENT OUR ATHLETIC FOOTWEAR PRODUCTS, FEATURE THE SAME TRADEMARKS AND ARE SOLD THROUGH THE SAME MARKETING AND DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS.

WE OFTEN MARKET FOOTWEAR, APPAREL AND ACCESSORIES IN COLLECTIONS OF SIMILAR DESIGN OR FOR SPECIFIC PURPOSES. WE ALSO MARKET APPAREL WITH LICENSED COLLEGE AND PROFESSIONAL TEAM AND LEAGUE LOGOS.

WE SELL A LINE OF PERFORMANCE EQUIPMENT UNDER THE NIKE BRAND NAME, INCLUDING BAGS, SOCKS, SPORT BALLS, EYEWEAR, TIMEPIECES, ELECTRONIC DEVICES, BATS,

GLOVES, PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT, GOLF CLUBS, AND OTHER EQUIPMENT DESIGNED FOR SPORTS ACTIVITIES. WE ALSO HAVE AGREEMENTS FOR LICENSEES TO PRODUCE AND SELL NIKE BRAND SWIMWEAR, TEAM SPORTS APPAREL, TRAINING EQUIPMENT, CHILDRENS CLOTHING,

ELECTRONIC DEVICES, EYEWEAR, GOLF ACCESSORIES, AND BELTS. WE ALSO SELL SMALL AMOUNTS OF VARIOUS PLASTIC PRODUCTS TO OTHER MANUFACTURERS THROUGH OUR WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARY, NIKE IHM, INC.

SALES AND MARKETING

FINANCIAL INFORMATION ABOUT GEOGRAPHIC AND SEGMENT OPERATIONS APPEARS IN NOTE 17 OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ON PAGE 75.

WE EXPERIENCE MODERATE FLUCTUATIONS IN AGGREGATE SALES VOLUME DURING THE YEAR. HISTORICALLY, REVENUES IN THE FIRST AND FOURTH FISCAL QUARTERS HAVE SLIGHTLY EXCEEDED THOSE IN THE SECOND AND THIRD QUARTERS. HOWEVER, THE MIX OF PRODUCT SALES

MAY VARY CONSIDERABLY FROM TIME TO TIME AS A RESULT OF CHANGES IN SEASONAL AND GEOGRAPHIC DEMAND FOR PARTICULAR TYPES OF FOOTWEAR, APPAREL AND EQUIPMENT.

BECAUSE NIKE IS A CONSUMER PRODUCTS COMPANY, THE RELATIVE POPULARITY OF VARIOUS SPORTS AND FITNESS ACTIVITIES AND CHANGING DESIGN TRENDS AFFECT THE DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS. WE MUST THEREFORE RESPOND TO TRENDS AND

SHIFTS IN CONSUMER PREFERENCES BY ADJUSTING THE MIX OF EXISTING PRODUCT OFFERINGS, DEVELOPING NEW PRODUCTS, STYLES AND CATEGORIES, AND INFLUENCING SPORTS AND FITNESS PREFERENCES THROUGH AGGRESSIVE MARKETING. FAILURE TO RESPOND IN A TIMELY AND

ADEQUATE MANNER COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR SALES AND PROFITABILITY. THIS IS A CONTINUING RISK.

UNITED STATES

MARKET

IN FISCAL 2008, SALES IN THE UNITED STATES INCLUDING U.S. SALES OF COLE HAAN, CONVERSE, EXETER BRANDS GROUP (WHICH WE SOLD

IN DECEMBER, 2007), HURLEY, UMBRO, NIKE BAUER HOCKEY (WHICH WE SOLD IN APRIL, 2008) AND NIKE GOLF ACCOUNTED FOR APPROXIMATELY 43 PERCENT OF TOTAL REVENUES, COMPARED TO 47 PERCENT IN FISCAL 2007 AND 47 PERCENT IN FISCAL 2006. WE ESTIMATE THAT WE SELL

TO MORE THAN 25,000 RETAIL ACCOUNTS IN THE UNITED STATES. THE NIKE BRAND DOMESTIC RETAIL ACCOUNT BASE INCLUDES A MIX OF FOOTWEAR STORES, SPORTING GOODS STORES, ATHLETIC SPECIALTY STORES, DEPARTMENT STORES, SKATE, TENNIS AND GOLF SHOPS, AND OTHER

RETAIL ACCOUNTS. DURING FISCAL YEAR 2008, OUR THREE LARGEST CUSTOMERS ACCOUNTED FOR APPROXIMATELY 24 PERCENT OF NIKE BRAND SALES IN THE UNITED STATES.

WE MAKE SUBSTANTIAL USE OF OUR FUTURES ORDERING PROGRAM, WHICH ALLOWS RETAILERS TO ORDER FIVE TO SIX MONTHS IN ADVANCE OF DELIVERY WITH THE COMMITMENT THAT THEIR ORDERS WILL BE DELIVERED WITHIN A SET

TIME PERIOD AT A FIXED PRICE. IN FISCAL YEAR 2008, 86 PERCENT OF OUR U.S. WHOLESALE FOOTWEAR SHIPMENTS (EXCLUDING COLE HAAN, CONVERSE, EXETER BRANDS GROUP, HURLEY, NIKE GOLF, UMBRO, AND NIKE BAUER HOCKEY) WERE MADE UNDER THE FUTURES PROGRAM,

COMPARED TO 94 PERCENT IN FISCAL 2007 AND 90 PERCENT IN FISCAL 2006. IN FISCAL 2008, 62 PERCENT OF OUR U.S. WHOLESALE APPAREL SHIPMENTS (EXCLUDING COLE HAAN, CONVERSE, EXETER BRANDS GROUP, HURLEY, NIKE GOLF, UMBRO, AND NIKE BAUER HOCKEY) WERE MADE

UNDER THE FUTURES PROGRAM, COMPARED TO 65 PERCENT IN FISCAL 2007 AND 2006.

NO CUSTOMER ACCOUNTED FOR 10 PERCENT OR MORE OF OUR NET SALES DURING FISCAL 2008.

ORDERS

WORLDWIDE FUTURES AND ADVANCE ORDERS FOR NIKE BRAND ATHLETIC FOOTWEAR

AND APPAREL, SCHEDULED FOR DELIVERY FROM JUNE THROUGH NOVEMBER 2008, WERE $8.8 BILLION COMPARED TO $7.7 BILLION FOR THE SAME PERIOD LAST YEAR. THIS FUTURES AND ADVANCE ORDER AMOUNT IS CALCULATED BASED UPON OUR FORECAST OF THE ACTUAL EXCHANGE RATES

UNDER WHICH OUR REVENUES WILL BE TRANSLATED DURING THIS PERIOD, WHICH APPROXIMATE CURRENT SPOT RATES. BASED UPON HISTORICAL DATA, WE EXPECT THAT APPROXIMATELY 95 PERCENT OF THESE ORDERS WILL BE FILLED IN THAT TIME PERIOD, ALTHOUGH SOME ORDERS MAY BE

CANCELLED. REPORTED FUTURES AND ADVANCE ORDERS ARE NOT NECESSARILY INDICATIVE OF OUR EXPECTATION OF REVENUES FOR THIS PERIOD. THIS IS BECAUSE THE MIX OF ORDERS CAN SHIFT BETWEEN ADVANCE/FUTURES AND AT-ONCE ORDERS. IN ADDITION, FOREIGN CURRENCY

EXCHANGE RATE FLUCTUATIONS AS WELL AS DIFFERING LEVELS OF ORDER CANCELLATIONS AND DISCOUNTS CAN CAUSE DIFFERENCES IN THE COMPARISONS BETWEEN FUTURES AND ADVANCE ORDERS AND ACTUAL REVENUES. MOREOVER, A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR REVENUE IS NOT

DERIVED FROM FUTURES AND ADVANCE ORDERS, INCLUDING AT-ONCE AND CLOSE-OUT SALES OF NIKE FOOTWEAR AND APPAREL, WHOLESALE SALES OF EQUIPMENT, COLE HAAN, CONVERSE, HURLEY, UMBRO, NIKE GOLF, AND RETAIL SALES ACROSS ALL BRANDS.

PRODUCT RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

WE BELIEVE THAT OUR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS ARE A KEY FACTOR IN OUR PAST AND FUTURE SUCCESS. TECHNICAL INNOVATION IN THE DESIGN OF FOOTWEAR, APPAREL, AND ATHLETIC EQUIPMENT RECEIVE CONTINUED EMPHASIS AS NIKE STRIVES TO PRODUCE

PRODUCTS THAT HELP TO REDUCE INJURY, ENHANCE ATHLETIC PERFORMANCE AND MAXIMIZE COMFORT.

IN ADDITION TO NIKES OWN STAFF OF

SPECIALISTS IN THE AREAS OF BIOMECHANICS, EXERCISE PHYSIOLOGY, ENGINEERING, INDUSTRIAL DESIGN AND RELATED FIELDS, WE ALSO UTILIZE RESEARCH COMMITTEES AND ADVISORY BOARDS MADE UP OF ATHLETES, COACHES, TRAINERS, EQUIPMENT MANAGERS, ORTHOPEDISTS,

PODIATRISTS AND OTHER EXPERTS WHO CONSULT WITH US AND REVIEW DESIGNS, MATERIALS AND CONCEPTS FOR PRODUCT IMPROVEMENT. EMPLOYEE ATHLETES AND OTHER ATHLETES WEAR-TEST AND EVALUATE PRODUCTS DURING THE DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT PROCESS.

MANUFACTURING

VIRTUALLY ALL

OF OUR FOOTWEAR IS PRODUCED OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES. IN FISCAL 2008, CONTRACT SUPPLIERS IN CHINA, VIETNAM, INDONESIA AND THAILAND MANUFACTURED 36 PERCENT, 33 PERCENT, 21 PERCENT AND 9 PERCENT OF TOTAL NIKE BRAND FOOTWEAR, RESPECTIVELY. WE ALSO

HAVE MANUFACTURING AGREEMENTS WITH INDEPENDENT FACTORIES IN ARGENTINA, BRAZIL, INDIA, ITALY, AND SOUTH AFRICA TO MANUFACTURE FOOTWEAR FOR SALE PRIMARILY WITHIN THOSE COUNTRIES. OUR LARGEST SINGLE FOOTWEAR FACTORY ACCOUNTED FOR APPROXIMATELY 6

PERCENT OF TOTAL FISCAL 2008 FOOTWEAR PRODUCTION.

ALMOST ALL OF NIKE BRAND APPAREL PRODUCTION WAS MANUFACTURED OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED

STATES BY INDEPENDENT CONTRACT MANUFACTURERS LOCATED IN 34 COUNTRIES. MOST OF THIS APPAREL PRODUCTION OCCURRED IN CHINA, THAILAND, INDONESIA, MALAYSIA, VIETNAM, TURKEY, SRI LANKA, HONDURAS, MEXICO, TAIWAN, ISRAEL, CAMBODIA, INDIA AND BANGLADESH. OUR

LARGEST SINGLE APPAREL FACTORY ACCOUNTED FOR APPROXIMATELY 8 PERCENT OF TOTAL FISCAL 2008 APPAREL PRODUCTION.

THE PRINCIPAL MATERIALS USED

IN OUR FOOTWEAR PRODUCTS ARE NATURAL AND SYNTHETIC RUBBER, PLASTIC COMPOUNDS, FOAM CUSHIONING MATERIALS, NYLON, LEATHER, CANVAS AND POLYURETHANE FILMS USED TO MAKE AIR-SOLE CUSHIONING COMPONENTS. NIKE IHM, INC., AND NIKE (SUZHOU) SPORTS COMPANY,

LTD., BOTH WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARIES OF NIKE, AND INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS IN CHINA AND TAIWAN, ARE OUR LARGEST SUPPLIERS OF THE AIR-SOLE CUSHIONING COMPONENTS USED IN FOOTWEAR. THE PRINCIPAL MATERIALS USED IN OUR APPAREL PRODUCTS ARE NATURAL AND

SYNTHETIC

TABLE OF CONTENTS

FABRICS AND THREADS, PLASTIC AND METAL HARDWARE, AND SPECIALIZED PERFORMANCE FABRICS DESIGNED TO REPEL RAIN, RETAIN HEAT, OR EFFICIENTLY TRANSPORT BODY

MOISTURE. NIKES CONTRACTORS AND SUPPLIERS BUY RAW MATERIALS IN BULK. MOST RAW MATERIALS ARE AVAILABLE IN THE COUNTRIES WHERE MANUFACTURING TAKES PLACE. WE HAVE THUS FAR EXPERIENCED LITTLE DIFFICULTY IN SATISFYING OUR RAW MATERIAL REQUIREMENTS.

SINCE 1972, SOJITZ CORPORATION OF AMERICA (SOJITZ AMERICA), A LARGE JAPANESE TRADING COMPANY, HAS PERFORMED SIGNIFICANT

IMPORT-EXPORT FINANCING SERVICES FOR US. DURING FISCAL 2008, SOJITZ AMERICA PROVIDED FINANCING AND PURCHASING SERVICES FOR NIKE BRAND PRODUCTS SOLD IN ARGENTINA, URUGUAY, CANADA, CHILE, BRAZIL, INDIA, INDONESIA, THE PHILIPPINES, MALAYSIA, SOUTH

AFRICA, CHINA, KOREA, AND THAILAND EXCLUDING PRODUCTS PRODUCED AND SOLD IN THE SAME COUNTRY. APPROXIMATELY 14 PERCENT OF NIKE BRAND SALES OCCURRED IN THOSE COUNTRIES. ANY FAILURE OF SOJITZ AMERICA TO PROVIDE THESE SERVICES OR ANY FAILURE OF SOJITZ

AMERICAS BANKS COULD DISRUPT OUR ABILITY TO ACQUIRE PRODUCTS FROM OUR SUPPLIERS AND TO DELIVER PRODUCTS TO OUR CUSTOMERS OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES, EUROPE, MIDDLE EAST, AFRICA AND JAPAN. SUCH A DISRUPTION COULD RESULT IN CANCELLED ORDERS

THAT WOULD ADVERSELY AFFECT SALES AND PROFITABILITY. HOWEVER, WE BELIEVE THAT ANY SUCH DISRUPTION WOULD BE SHORT TERM IN DURATION DUE TO THE READY AVAILABILITY OF ALTERNATIVE SOURCES OF FINANCING AT COMPETITIVE RATES. OUR CURRENT AGREEMENTS WITH

SOJITZ AMERICA EXPIRE IN 2011.

INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS AND TRADE

OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS AND SOURCES OF SUPPLY ARE SUBJECT TO THE USUAL RISKS OF DOING BUSINESS ABROAD, SUCH AS POSSIBLE REVALUATION OF CURRENCIES,

EXPORT DUTIES, ANTI-DUMPING DUTIES, QUOTAS, SAFEGUARD MEASURES, TRADE RESTRICTIONS, RESTRICTIONS ON THE TRANSFER OF FUNDS AND, IN CERTAIN PARTS OF THE WORLD, POLITICAL INSTABILITY AND TERRORISM. WE HAVE NOT, TO DATE, BEEN MATERIALLY AFFECTED BY ANY

SUCH RISK, BUT CANNOT PREDICT THE LIKELIHOOD OF SUCH DEVELOPMENTS OCCURRING. WE BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO DEVELOP, OVER A PERIOD OF TIME, ADEQUATE ALTERNATIVE SOURCES OF SUPPLY FOR THE PRODUCTS OBTAINED FROM OUR PRESENT SUPPLIERS OUTSIDE

OF THE UNITED STATES. IF EVENTS PREVENTED US FROM ACQUIRING PRODUCTS FROM OUR SUPPLIERS IN A PARTICULAR COUNTRY, OUR OPERATIONS COULD BE TEMPORARILY DISRUPTED AND WE COULD EXPERIENCE AN ADVERSE FINANCIAL IMPACT. HOWEVER, WE BELIEVE THAT WE COULD

ABATE ANY SUCH DISRUPTION WITHIN A PERIOD OF NO MORE THAN 12 MONTHS, AND THAT MUCH OF THE ADVERSE IMPACT ON SUPPLY WOULD, THEREFORE, BE OF A SHORT-TERM NATURE. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR PRINCIPAL COMPETITORS ARE SUBJECT TO SIMILAR RISKS.

ALL OF OUR PRODUCTS MANUFACTURED OVERSEAS AND IMPORTED INTO THE UNITED STATES, THE EUROPEAN UNION (EU) AND OTHER COUNTRIES ARE SUBJECT TO

CUSTOMS DUTIES COLLECTED BY CUSTOMS AUTHORITIES. CUSTOMS INFORMATION SUBMITTED BY US IS ROUTINELY SUBJECT TO REVIEW BY CUSTOMS AUTHORITIES. WE ARE UNABLE TO PREDICT WHETHER ADDITIONAL CUSTOMS DUTIES, ANTI-DUMPING DUTIES, QUOTAS, SAFEGUARD MEASURES,

OR OTHER TRADE RESTRICTIONS MAY BE IMPOSED ON THE IMPORTATION OF OUR PRODUCTS IN THE FUTURE. SUCH ACTIONS COULD RESULT IN INCREASES IN THE COST OF OUR PRODUCTS GENERALLY WHICH MIGHT ADVERSELY AFFECT THE SALES OR PROFITABILITY OF NIKE AND THE

IMPORTED FOOTWEAR AND APPAREL INDUSTRY AS A WHOLE. ACCORDINGLY, WE ARE ACTIVELY MONITORING THE DEVELOPMENTS DESCRIBED BELOW.

FOOTWEAR

IMPORTS INTO THE EUROPEAN UNION

FROM 1994 THROUGH JANUARY 1, 2005, THE EU IMPOSED LIMITS (OR QUOTAS) ON THE IMPORT OF

CERTAIN TYPES OF FOOTWEAR MANUFACTURED IN CHINA. FOOTWEAR DESIGNED FOR USE IN SPORTING ACTIVITIES, MEETING CERTAIN TECHNICAL CRITERIA AND HAVING A CIF (COST, INSURANCE AND FREIGHT) PRICE ABOVE NINE EUROS (SPECIAL TECHNOLOGY ATHLETIC

FOOTWEAR OR STAF), WAS EXCLUDED FROM THE QUOTAS. AS A RESULT OF THE STAF EXCLUSION, AND THE AMOUNT OF QUOTA MADE AVAILABLE TO US, THE QUOTAS DID NOT HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS. HOWEVER, AS PART OF CHINAS 2001

ACCESSION TO THE WORLD TRADE ORGANIZATION (WTO), CHINA ENTERED INTO AN AGREEMENT WITH THE EU AND OTHER WTO MEMBERS TO ABIDE BY A SPECIAL SAFEGUARD ARRANGEMENT WHEREBY QUOTAS COULD BE IMPOSED ON ANY PRODUCT SOURCED IN CHINA, INCLUDING

FOOTWEAR, IF THERE WAS A SURGE IN IMPORTS FROM CHINA INTO ANOTHER WTO COUNTRY, AND AFTER A LEGAL PROCEEDING IT WAS DETERMINED THAT SUCH IMPORTS WERE INJURING A DOMESTIC PRODUCER. ADDITIONALLY, UNDER LONGSTANDING WTO RULES, ALL WTO MEMBER COUNTRIES

RESERVED THE RIGHT TO IMPOSE (1) SAFEGUARD MEASURES (TEMPORARY QUOTAS) IF IT CAN BE DEMONSTRATED IN A LEGAL PROCEEDING THAT INCREASED IMPORTS

6

TABLE OF CONTENTS

ARE INJURING ANOTHER WTO MEMBERS DOMESTIC INDUSTRY; AND (2) ANTI-DUMPING MEASURES IF IT CAN BE DEMONSTRATED IN A LEGAL PROCEEDING THAT IMPORTS ARE

BEING SOLD AT AN UNFAIR LOW PRICE IN ANOTHER WTO MEMBERS HOME MARKET, AND THOSE IMPORTS WERE CAUSING OR THREATENING TO CAUSE MATERIAL INJURY TO THE DOMESTIC INDUSTRY.

ACCORDINGLY, WITH THE PHASE-OUT OF THE QUOTAS AT THE BEGINNING OF 2005, AND THE EXPIRATION OF A SEPARATE EU ANTI-DUMPING CASE IN 2003 AGAINST FOOTWEAR

MADE IN CHINA, INDONESIA, AND THAILAND, THERE HAS BEEN RENEWED PRESSURE FROM SOME PARTS OF THE EU FOOTWEAR MANUFACTURING SECTOR TO RE-IMPOSE SOME LEVEL OF TRADE PROTECTION ON IMPORTED FOOTWEAR FROM CHINA, INDIA, VIETNAM, AND OTHER EXPORTING

COUNTRIES. IN JULY 2005, THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION (EC), AT THE REQUEST OF THE EUROPEAN DOMESTIC FOOTWEAR INDUSTRY, INITIATED INVESTIGATIONS INTO LEATHER FOOTWEAR IMPORTED FROM CHINA AND VIETNAM. NIKE AND ALL OTHER MAJOR ATHLETIC FOOTWEAR

MANUFACTURERS PARTICIPATED ACTIVELY AS RESPONDENTS IN THIS INVESTIGATION AND TOOK THE POSITION THAT ATHLETIC FOOTWEAR (I) SHOULD NOT BE WITHIN THE PRODUCT SCOPE OF THE INVESTIGATION, AND (II) DOES NOT MEET THE LEGAL REQUIREMENTS OF INJURY

AND PRICE IN AN ANTI-DUMPING INVESTIGATION. OUR ARGUMENTS WERE SUCCESSFUL AND THE EU AGREED IN OCTOBER 2006 ON DEFINITIVE DUTIES OF 16.5% FOR CHINA AND 10% FOR VIETNAM, BUT EXCLUDED STAF FROM THE MEASURES, AND ALSO AGREED TO IMPLEMENT THE DUTIES FOR

TWO YEARS RATHER THAN THE NORMAL FIVE-YEAR PERIOD. AS A RESULT, THESE MEASURES DID NOT SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT OUR BUSINESS AND WE BELIEVE THAT OUR MAJOR COMPETITORS STAND IN MUCH THE SAME POSITION REGARDING THESE TRADE MEASURES.

WE UNDERSTAND THAT SINCE THE ANTI-DUMPING DUTIES ON NON-STAF LEATHER FOOTWEAR IMPOSED IN 2006 WILL EXPIRE ON OCTOBER 8, 2008 THE EU DOMESTIC

FOOTWEAR INDUSTRY HAS REQUESTED THAT THE EC INITIATE A REVIEW OF THOSE MEASURES. THE EC WILL SCRUTINIZE THE REQUEST CLOSELY, AND MAKE A DECISION BY EARLY OCTOBER 2008 WHETHER TO INITIATE A REVIEW, AND IF SO, THE SCOPE OF THAT REVIEW. IF THE EC

CONDUCTS A REVIEW, THE CURRENT DEFINITIVE ANTI-DUMPING DUTIES WILL REMAIN IN FORCE FOR AN ADDITIONAL 15 MONTHS UNTIL THE CONCLUSION OF THE REVIEW IN LATE 2009 OR EARLY 2010. IT IS ALSO POSSIBLE THAT THE EC COULD INITIATE A SO-CALLED

INTERIM REVIEW OF THE ANTI-DUMPING MEASURES, IN WHICH CASE THE EC MAY REVIEW THE SCOPE OF THE STAF EXEMPTION AND THE LEVEL OF THE DUTIES, AMONG OTHER THINGS.

TRADE RELATIONS WITH CHINA

CHINA REPRESENTS AN IMPORTANT SOURCING AND MARKETING COUNTRY FOR US. MANY

GOVERNMENTS AROUND THE WORLD ARE CONCERNED ABOUT CHINAS GROWING AND FAST-PACED ECONOMY, COMPLIANCE WITH WTO RULES, CURRENCY VALUATION, AND HIGH TRADE DEFICITS. AS A RESULT THERE IS A WIDE RANGE OF LEGISLATIVE PROPOSALS THAT HAVE BEEN

INTRODUCED TO ADDRESS THESE CONCERNS. WHILE SOME OF THESE CONCERNS ARE JUSTIFIED, WE ARE WORKING WITH BROAD COALITIONS OF GLOBAL BUSINESSES AND TRADE ASSOCIATIONS REPRESENTING A WIDE VARIETY OF SECTORS (E.G. SERVICES, MANUFACTURING, AGRICULTURE) TO

HELP ENSURE THAT ANY LEGISLATION ENACTED AND IMPLEMENTED (I) ADDRESSES LEGITIMATE AND CORE CONCERNS, (II) IS CONSISTENT WITH INTERNATIONAL TRADE RULES, AND (III) IS REFLECTIVE AND CONSIDERATE OF CHINAS DOMESTIC ECONOMY AND

IMPORTANT ROLE IN THE GLOBAL ECONOMIC COMMUNITY. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR MAJOR COMPETITORS AS WELL AS MOST OTHER MULTI-NATIONAL COMPANIES STAND IN MUCH THE SAME POSITION REGARDING THESE TRADE MEASURES.

COMPETITION

THE ATHLETIC

FOOTWEAR, APPAREL AND EQUIPMENT INDUSTRY IS KEENLY COMPETITIVE IN THE UNITED STATES AND ON A WORLDWIDE BASIS. WE COMPETE INTERNATIONALLY WITH AN INCREASING NUMBER OF ATHLETIC AND LEISURE SHOE COMPANIES, ATHLETIC AND LEISURE APPAREL COMPANIES, SPORTS

EQUIPMENT COMPANIES, AND LARGE COMPANIES HAVING DIVERSIFIED LINES OF ATHLETIC AND LEISURE SHOES, APPAREL AND EQUIPMENT, INCLUDING ADIDAS, PUMA, AND OTHERS. THE INTENSE COMPETITION AND THE RAPID CHANGES IN TECHNOLOGY AND CONSUMER PREFERENCES IN THE

MARKETS FOR ATHLETIC AND LEISURE FOOTWEAR AND APPAREL, AND ATHLETIC EQUIPMENT, CONSTITUTE SIGNIFICANT RISK FACTORS IN OUR OPERATIONS.

IS THE LARGEST SELLER OF ATHLETIC FOOTWEAR AND ATHLETIC APPAREL IN THE WORLD. PERFORMANCE AND RELIABILITY OF SHOES, APPAREL, AND EQUIPMENT, NEW PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT, PRICE, PRODUCT IDENTITY THROUGH MARKETING AND PROMOTION, AND CUSTOMER SUPPORT AND

SERVICE ARE IMPORTANT ASPECTS OF COMPETITION IN THE ATHLETIC FOOTWEAR, APPAREL AND EQUIPMENT INDUSTRY. TO HELP MARKET OUR PRODUCTS, WE CONTRACT WITH PROMINENT AND INFLUENTIAL ATHLETES, COACHES, TEAMS, COLLEGES AND SPORTS LEAGUES TO ENDORSE OUR

BRANDS AND USE OUR PRODUCTS, AND WE ACTIVELY SPONSOR SPORTING EVENTS AND CLINICS. WE BELIEVE THAT WE ARE COMPETITIVE IN ALL OF THESE AREAS.

TRADEMARKS AND PATENTS

WE UTILIZE TRADEMARKS ON NEARLY ALL OF OUR PRODUCTS AND BELIEVE THAT HAVING DISTINCTIVE MARKS THAT

ARE READILY IDENTIFIABLE IS AN IMPORTANT FACTOR IN CREATING A MARKET FOR OUR GOODS, IN IDENTIFYING THE COMPANY, AND IN DISTINGUISHING OUR GOODS FROM THE GOODS OF OTHERS. WE CONSIDER OUR NIKE

®

AND SWOOSH DESIGN

®

TRADEMARKS TO BE AMONG OUR MOST VALUABLE ASSETS AND WE HAVE REGISTERED THESE TRADEMARKS IN OVER 100 COUNTRIES. IN ADDITION, WE OWN MANY

OTHER TRADEMARKS THAT WE UTILIZE IN MARKETING OUR PRODUCTS. WE CONTINUE TO VIGOROUSLY PROTECT OUR TRADEMARKS AGAINST INFRINGEMENT.

NIKE HAS AN EXCLUSIVE, WORLDWIDE LICENSE TO MAKE AND SELL FOOTWEAR USING PATENTED AIR

TECHNOLOGY. THE PROCESS UTILIZES PRESSURIZED GAS ENCAPSULATED IN POLYURETHANE. SOME OF THE EARLY NIKE AIR

®

PATENTS HAVE EXPIRED, WHICH MAY ENABLE COMPETITORS TO USE CERTAIN TYPES OF SIMILAR

TECHNOLOGY. SUBSEQUENT NIKE AIR

®

PATENTS WILL NOT EXPIRE FOR SEVERAL YEARS. WE ALSO HAVE HUNDREDS OF U.S. AND FOREIGN UTILITY PATENTS, AND THOUSANDS OF U.S. AND FOREIGN DESIGN PATENTS

COVERING COMPONENTS AND FEATURES USED IN VARIOUS ATHLETIC AND LEISURE SHOES, APPAREL, AND EQUIPMENT. THESE PATENTS EXPIRE AT VARIOUS TIMES, AND PATENTS ISSUED FOR APPLICATIONS FILED THIS YEAR WILL HAVE A REMAINING DURATION OF FROM NOW TO 2022 FOR

DESIGN PATENTS, AND FROM NOW TO 2028 FOR UTILITY PATENTS. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR SUCCESS DEPENDS PRIMARILY UPON SKILLS IN DESIGN, RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, PRODUCTION AND MARKETING RATHER THAN UPON OUR PATENT POSITION. HOWEVER, WE HAVE FOLLOWED A

POLICY OF FILING APPLICATIONS FOR UNITED STATES AND FOREIGN PATENTS ON INVENTIONS, DESIGNS AND IMPROVEMENTS THAT WE DEEM VALUABLE.

EMPLOYEES

WE HAD APPROXIMATELY 32,500 EMPLOYEES AT MAY 31, 2008. MANAGEMENT CONSIDERS ITS RELATIONSHIP WITH EMPLOYEES TO BE

EXCELLENT. NONE OF OUR EMPLOYEES IS REPRESENTED BY A UNION, WITH THE EXCEPTION OF 23 EMPLOYEES IN MEXICO, THE COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENT FOR WHICH EXPIRES IN 2009. ALSO, IN SOME COUNTRIES OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES, LOCAL LAWS REQUIRE

REPRESENTATION FOR EMPLOYEES BY WORKS COUNCILS (SUCH AS IN THE EU, IN WHICH THEY ARE ENTITLED TO INFORMATION AND CONSULTATION ON CERTAIN COMPANY DECISIONS) OR OTHER REPRESENTATION BY AN ORGANIZATION SIMILAR TO A UNION, ALTHOUGH COLLECTIVE BARGAINING

AGREEMENTS ARE NOT INVOLVED. THERE HAS NEVER BEEN A MATERIAL INTERRUPTION OF OPERATIONS DUE TO LABOR DISAGREEMENTS.

DIFFICULTIES IN IMPLEMENTING, OPERATING, AND MAINTAINING NIKES INCREASINGLY COMPLEX INFORMATION SYSTEMS AND CONTROLS, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE SYSTEMS RELATED TO DEMAND AND SUPPLY PLANNING, AND INVENTORY CONTROL; INTERRUPTIONS IN

DATA AND COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEMS; FLUCTUATIONS AND DIFFICULTY IN FORECASTING OPERATING RESULTS, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE FACT THAT ADVANCE FUTURES ORDERS MAY NOT BE INDICATIVE OF FUTURE REVENUES DUE TO THE CHANGING MIX OF

FUTURES AND AT-ONCE ORDERS, CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE FLUCTUATIONS, ORDER CANCELLATIONS, AND THE FACT THAT A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR REVENUE IS NOT DERIVED FROM FUTURES ORDERS; THE ABILITY OF NIKE TO SUSTAIN, MANAGE OR FORECAST ITS GROWTH AND

INVENTORIES; THE SIZE, TIMING AND MIX OF PURCHASES OF NIKES PRODUCTS; INCREASES IN THE COST OF MATERIALS AND ENERGY USED TO MANUFACTURE PRODUCTS, NEW PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT AND INTRODUCTION; THE ABILITY TO SECURE AND PROTECT TRADEMARKS, PATENTS,

TRANSPORTATION TO MEET DELIVERY DEADLINES; INCREASES IN BORROWING COSTS DUE TO ANY DECLINE IN OUR DEBT RATINGS; CHANGES IN BUSINESS STRATEGY OR DEVELOPMENT PLANS; GENERAL RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH DOING BUSINESS OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES, INCLUDING

WITHOUT LIMITATION, IMPORT DUTIES, TARIFFS, QUOTAS, POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC INSTABILITY, AND TERRORISM; CHANGES IN GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS; LIABILITY AND OTHER CLAIMS ASSERTED AGAINST NIKE; THE ABILITY TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN QUALIFIED PERSONNEL; AND

OTHER FACTORS REFERENCED OR INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE IN THIS REPORT AND OTHER REPORTS.

THE RISKS INCLUDED HERE ARE NOT EXHAUSTIVE. OTHER

SECTIONS OF THIS REPORT MAY INCLUDE ADDITIONAL FACTORS WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT NIKES BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE. MOREOVER, NIKE OPERATES IN A VERY COMPETITIVE AND RAPIDLY CHANGING ENVIRONMENT. NEW RISK FACTORS EMERGE FROM TIME TO

TIME AND IT IS NOT POSSIBLE FOR MANAGEMENT TO PREDICT ALL SUCH RISK FACTORS, NOR CAN IT ASSESS THE IMPACT OF ALL SUCH RISK FACTORS ON NIKES BUSINESS OR THE EXTENT TO WHICH ANY FACTOR, OR COMBINATION OF FACTORS, MAY CAUSE ACTUAL RESULTS TO

DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THOSE CONTAINED IN ANY FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS. GIVEN THESE RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES, INVESTORS SHOULD NOT PLACE UNDUE RELIANCE ON FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS AS A PREDICTION OF ACTUAL RESULTS.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

OUR PRODUCTS FACE INTENSE COMPETITION.

NIKE IS A CONSUMER PRODUCTS COMPANY AND THE RELATIVE POPULARITY OF VARIOUS SPORTS AND FITNESS ACTIVITIES AND CHANGING DESIGN TRENDS AFFECT THE DEMAND FOR

OUR PRODUCTS. THE ATHLETIC FOOTWEAR, APPAREL AND EQUIPMENT INDUSTRY IS KEENLY COMPETITIVE IN THE UNITED STATES AND ON A WORLDWIDE BASIS. WE COMPETE INTERNATIONALLY WITH AN INCREASING NUMBER OF ATHLETIC AND LEISURE SHOE COMPANIES, ATHLETIC AND

LEISURE APPAREL COMPANIES, SPORTS EQUIPMENT COMPANIES, AND LARGE COMPANIES HAVING DIVERSIFIED LINES OF ATHLETIC AND LEISURE SHOES, APPAREL AND EQUIPMENT. WE ALSO COMPETE WITH OTHER COMPANIES FOR THE PRODUCTION CAPACITY OF INDEPENDENT MANUFACTURERS

THAT PRODUCE OUR PRODUCTS AND FOR IMPORT QUOTA CAPACITY.

OUR COMPETITORS PRODUCT OFFERINGS, TECHNOLOGIES, MARKETING EXPENDITURES

(INCLUDING FOR ADVERTISING AND ENDORSEMENTS), PRICING, COSTS OF PRODUCTION, AND CUSTOMER SERVICE ARE AREAS OF INTENSE COMPETITION. THIS, IN ADDITION TO RAPID CHANGES IN TECHNOLOGY AND CONSUMER PREFERENCES IN THE MARKETS FOR ATHLETIC AND LEISURE

FOOTWEAR AND APPAREL, AND ATHLETIC EQUIPMENT, CONSTITUTE SIGNIFICANT RISK FACTORS IN OUR OPERATIONS. IF WE DO NOT ADEQUATELY AND TIMELY ANTICIPATE AND RESPOND TO OUR COMPETITORS, OUR COSTS MAY INCREASE OR THE CONSUMER DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS MAY

DECLINE SIGNIFICANTLY.

IF WE ARE UNABLE TO ANTICIPATE CONSUMER PREFERENCES AND DEVELOP NEW PRODUCTS, WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO MAINTAIN OR INCREASE OUR

NET REVENUES AND PROFITS.

OUR SUCCESS DEPENDS ON OUR ABILITY TO IDENTIFY, ORIGINATE AND DEFINE PRODUCT TRENDS AS WELL AS TO

ANTICIPATE, GAUGE AND REACT TO CHANGING CONSUMER DEMANDS IN A TIMELY MANNER. ALL OF OUR PRODUCTS ARE SUBJECT TO CHANGING CONSUMER PREFERENCES THAT CANNOT BE PREDICTED WITH CERTAINTY. OUR NEW PRODUCTS MAY NOT RECEIVE CONSUMER ACCEPTANCE AS CONSUMER

PREFERENCES COULD SHIFT RAPIDLY TO DIFFERENT TYPES OF PERFORMANCE OR OTHER SPORTS APPAREL OR AWAY FROM THESE TYPES OF PRODUCTS ALTOGETHER, AND OUR FUTURE SUCCESS DEPENDS IN PART ON OUR ABILITY TO ANTICIPATE AND RESPOND TO THESE CHANGES. IF WE FAIL

TO ANTICIPATE ACCURATELY AND RESPOND TO TRENDS AND SHIFTS IN CONSUMER PREFERENCES BY ADJUSTING THE MIX OF EXISTING PRODUCT OFFERINGS, DEVELOPING NEW PRODUCTS, DESIGNS, STYLES AND CATEGORIES, AND INFLUENCING SPORTS AND FITNESS PREFERENCES THROUGH

AGGRESSIVE MARKETING, WE COULD EXPERIENCE LOWER SALES, EXCESS INVENTORIES AND LOWER PROFIT MARGINS, ANY OF WHICH COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

WE RELY ON TECHNICAL INNOVATION AND HIGH QUALITY PRODUCTS TO COMPETE IN THE MARKET FOR OUR PRODUCTS.

ALTHOUGH DESIGN AND AESTHETICS OF OUR PRODUCTS APPEAR TO BE THE MOST IMPORTANT FACTOR FOR CONSUMER ACCEPTANCE OF OUR PRODUCTS, TECHNICAL INNOVATION AND

QUALITY CONTROL IN THE DESIGN OF FOOTWEAR, APPAREL, AND ATHLETIC EQUIPMENT IS ALSO ESSENTIAL TO THE COMMERCIAL SUCCESS OF OUR PRODUCTS. RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT PLAYS A KEY ROLE IN TECHNICAL INNOVATION. WE RELY UPON SPECIALISTS IN THE FIELDS OF

BIOMECHANICS, EXERCISE PHYSIOLOGY, ENGINEERING, INDUSTRIAL DESIGN AND RELATED FIELDS, AS WELL AS RESEARCH COMMITTEES AND ADVISORY BOARDS MADE UP OF ATHLETES, COACHES, TRAINERS, EQUIPMENT MANAGERS, ORTHOPEDISTS, PODIATRISTS AND OTHER EXPERTS TO

DEVELOP AND TEST CUTTING EDGE PERFORMANCE PRODUCTS. WHILE WE STRIVE TO PRODUCE PRODUCTS THAT HELP TO REDUCE INJURY, ENHANCE ATHLETIC PERFORMANCE AND MAXIMIZE COMFORT, IF WE FAIL TO INTRODUCE TECHNICAL INNOVATION IN OUR PRODUCTS THE CONSUMER DEMAND

FOR OUR PRODUCTS COULD DECLINE, AND IF WE EXPERIENCE PROBLEMS WITH THE QUALITY OF OUR PRODUCTS, WE MAY INCUR SUBSTANTIAL EXPENSE TO REMEDY THE PROBLEMS.

FAILURE TO CONTINUE TO OBTAIN HIGH QUALITY ENDORSERS OF OUR PRODUCTS COULD HARM OUR BUSINESS.

WE ESTABLISH

RELATIONSHIPS WITH PROFESSIONAL ATHLETES AND SPORTS TEAMS AND LEAGUES TO EVALUATE AND PROMOTE OUR PRODUCTS, AND ESTABLISH THE AUTHENTICITY OF OUR PRODUCTS WITH CONSUMERS. IF CERTAIN OF OUR ENDORSERS WERE TO STOP USING OUR PRODUCTS CONTRARY TO THEIR

ENDORSEMENT AGREEMENTS, OUR BUSINESS COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED. IN ADDITION, ACTIONS TAKEN BY ATHLETES, TEAMS OR LEAGUES ASSOCIATED WITH OUR PRODUCTS THAT HARM THE REPUTATIONS OF THOSE ATHLETES, TEAMS OR LEAGUES COULD ALSO HARM OUR BRAND IMAGE

WITH CONSUMERS AND, AS A RESULT, COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR SALES AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. IN ADDITION, POOR PERFORMANCE BY OUR ENDORSERS, A FAILURE TO CONTINUE TO CORRECTLY IDENTIFY PROMISING ATHLETES TO USE AND ENDORSE OUR PRODUCTS, OR A

FAILURE TO ENTER INTO COST EFFECTIVE ENDORSEMENT ARRANGEMENTS WITH PROMINENT ATHLETES AND SPORTS ORGANIZATIONS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BRAND AND RESULT IN DECREASED SALES OF OUR PRODUCTS.

11

TABLE OF CONTENTS

FAILURE OF OUR CONTRACTORS TO COMPLY WITH OUR CODE OF CONDUCT, LOCAL LAWS, AND OTHER STANDARDS COULD HARM OUR

BUSINESS.

WE CONTRACT WITH HUNDREDS OF CONTRACTORS OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES TO MANUFACTURE NIKE BRAND PRODUCTS, AND WE IMPOSE

ON THOSE CONTRACTORS A CODE OF CONDUCT AND OTHER ENVIRONMENTAL, HEALTH, AND SAFETY STANDARDS FOR THE BENEFIT OF WORKERS. HOWEVER, FROM TIME TO TIME CONTRACTORS MAY NOT BE IN COMPLIANCE WITH SUCH STANDARDS OR APPLICABLE LOCAL LAW. SIGNIFICANT OR

CONTINUING NONCOMPLIANCE WITH SUCH STANDARDS AND LAWS BY ONE OR MORE CONTRACTORS COULD HARM OUR REPUTATION AND, AS A RESULT, COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR SALES AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

OUR BUSINESS IS AFFECTED BY SEASONALITY, WHICH COULD RESULT IN FLUCTUATIONS IN OUR OPERATING RESULTS AND STOCK PRICE.

WE EXPERIENCE MODERATE FLUCTUATIONS IN AGGREGATE SALES VOLUME DURING THE YEAR. HISTORICALLY, REVENUES IN THE FIRST AND FOURTH FISCAL QUARTERS HAVE

SLIGHTLY EXCEEDED THOSE IN THE SECOND AND THIRD FISCAL QUARTERS. HOWEVER, THE MIX OF PRODUCT SALES MAY VARY CONSIDERABLY FROM TIME TO TIME AS A RESULT OF CHANGES IN SEASONAL AND GEOGRAPHIC DEMAND FOR PARTICULAR TYPES OF FOOTWEAR, APPAREL AND

EQUIPMENT. IN ADDITION, OUR CUSTOMERS MAY CANCEL ORDERS, CHANGE DELIVERY SCHEDULES OR CHANGE THE MIX OF PRODUCTS ORDERED WITH MINIMAL NOTICE. AS A RESULT, WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO ACCURATELY PREDICT OUR QUARTERLY SALES. ACCORDINGLY, OUR RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS ARE LIKELY TO FLUCTUATE SIGNIFICANTLY FROM PERIOD TO PERIOD. THIS SEASONALITY, ALONG WITH OTHER FACTORS THAT ARE BEYOND OUR CONTROL, INCLUDING GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, CHANGES IN CONSUMER PREFERENCES, WEATHER CONDITIONS, AVAILABILITY

OF IMPORT QUOTAS AND CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE FLUCTUATIONS, COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS AND CAUSE OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS TO FLUCTUATE. OUR OPERATING MARGINS ARE ALSO SENSITIVE TO A NUMBER OF FACTORS THAT ARE BEYOND OUR CONTROL, INCLUDING

SHIFTS IN PRODUCT SALES MIX, GEOGRAPHIC SALES TRENDS, AND CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE FLUCTUATIONS, ALL OF WHICH WE EXPECT TO CONTINUE. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN ANY PERIOD SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED INDICATIVE OF THE RESULTS TO BE EXPECTED FOR ANY FUTURE

PERIOD.

FUTURES ORDERS MAY NOT BE AN ACCURATE INDICATION OF OUR FUTURE REVENUES.

WE MAKE SUBSTANTIAL USE OF OUR FUTURES ORDERING PROGRAM, WHICH ALLOWS RETAILERS TO ORDER FIVE TO SIX MONTHS IN ADVANCE OF DELIVERY WITH THE

COMMITMENT THAT 90 PERCENT OF THEIR ORDERS WILL BE DELIVERED WITHIN A SET PERIOD AT A FIXED PRICE. OUR FUTURES ORDERING PROGRAM ALLOWS US TO MINIMIZE THE AMOUNT OF PRODUCTS WE HOLD IN INVENTORY, PURCHASING COSTS, THE TIME NECESSARY TO FILL CUSTOMER

ORDERS, AND THE RISK OF NON-DELIVERY. WE REPORT CHANGES IN FUTURES ORDERS IN OUR PERIODIC FINANCIAL REPORTS. ALTHOUGH WE BELIEVE FUTURES ORDERS ARE AN IMPORTANT INDICATOR OF OUR FUTURE REVENUES, REPORTED FUTURES ORDERS ARE NOT NECESSARILY INDICATIVE

OF OUR EXPECTATION OF CHANGES IN REVENUES FOR ANY FUTURE PERIOD. THIS IS BECAUSE THE MIX OF ORDERS CAN SHIFT BETWEEN ADVANCE/FUTURES AND AT-ONCE ORDERS. IN ADDITION, FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE FLUCTUATIONS, ORDER CANCELLATIONS, RETURNS, AND

DISCOUNTS CAN CAUSE DIFFERENCES IN THE COMPARISONS BETWEEN FUTURES ORDERS AND ACTUAL REVENUES. MOREOVER, A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR REVENUE IS NOT DERIVED FROM FUTURES ORDERS, INCLUDING AT-ONCE CLOSE-OUT SALES OF NIKE FOOTWEAR AND APPAREL,

WHOLESALE SALES OF EQUIPMENT, COLE HAAN, CONVERSE, EXETER BRANDS GROUP, HURLEY, NIKE BAUER HOCKEY, NIKE GOLF, AND RETAIL SALES ACROSS ALL BRANDS.

OUR FUTURES ORDERING PROGRAM DOES NOT PREVENT EXCESS INVENTORIES OR INVENTORY SHORTAGES, WHICH COULD RESULT IN DECREASED OPERATING MARGINS AND HARM TO OUR BUSINESS.

WE PURCHASE PRODUCTS FROM MANUFACTURERS OUTSIDE OF OUR FUTURES ORDERING PROGRAM AND IN ADVANCE OF CUSTOMER ORDERS, WHICH WE HOLD IN INVENTORY AND RE-SELL

TO CUSTOMERS. THERE IS A RISK THAT WE MAY BE UNABLE TO SELL EXCESS PRODUCTS THAT WE HAVE ORDERED FROM MANUFACTURERS. INVENTORY LEVELS IN EXCESS OF CUSTOMER DEMAND MAY RESULT IN INVENTORY WRITE-DOWNS, AND THE SALE OF EXCESS INVENTORY AT DISCOUNTED

PRICES COULD SIGNIFICANTLY IMPAIR OUR BRAND IMAGE AND HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR OPERATING RESULTS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. CONVERSELY, IF WE UNDERESTIMATE CONSUMER DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS OR IF OUR MANUFACTURERS FAIL TO SUPPLY THE PRODUCTS THAT

WE REQUIRE AT THE TIME WE NEED THEM, WE MAY EXPERIENCE INVENTORY SHORTAGES. INVENTORY SHORTAGES MIGHT DELAY SHIPMENTS TO CUSTOMERS, NEGATIVELY IMPACT RETAILER AND DISTRIBUTOR RELATIONSHIPS, AND DIMINISH BRAND LOYALTY.

12

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE DIFFICULTY IN FORECASTING DEMAND ALSO MAKES IT DIFFICULT TO ESTIMATE OUR FUTURE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

AND FINANCIAL CONDITION FROM PERIOD TO PERIOD. A FAILURE TO ACCURATELY PREDICT THE LEVEL OF DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR NET REVENUES AND NET INCOME, AND WE ARE UNLIKELY TO FORECAST SUCH EFFECTS WITH ANY CERTAINTY IN ADVANCE.

WE MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY THE FINANCIAL HEALTH OF OUR RETAILERS.

WE EXTEND CREDIT TO OUR CUSTOMERS BASED ON AN ASSESSMENT OF A CUSTOMERS FINANCIAL CONDITION, GENERALLY WITHOUT REQUIRING COLLATERAL. TO ASSIST IN

THE SCHEDULING OF PRODUCTION AND THE SHIPPING OF SEASONAL PRODUCTS, WE OFFER CUSTOMERS THE ABILITY TO PLACE ORDERS FIVE TO SIX MONTHS AHEAD OF DELIVERY UNDER OUR FUTURES ORDERING PROGRAM. THESE ADVANCE ORDERS MAY BE CANCELLED, AND THE

RISK OF CANCELLATION MAY INCREASE WHEN DEALING WITH FINANCIALLY AILING RETAILERS OR RETAILERS STRUGGLING WITH ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTY. IN THE PAST, SOME CUSTOMERS HAVE EXPERIENCED FINANCIAL DIFFICULTIES, WHICH IN TURN HAVE HAD AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR

BUSINESS. FROM TIME TO TIME RETAILERS WILL BE MORE CAUTIOUS THAN USUAL WITH ORDERS AS A RESULT OF WEAKNESS IN THE RETAIL ECONOMY. A SLOWING ECONOMY IN OUR KEY MARKETS COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE FINANCIAL HEALTH OF OUR CUSTOMERS, WHICH COULD

IN TURN HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. IN ADDITION, SALES OF OUR PRODUCTS DEPEND IN PART ON HIGH QUALITY MERCHANDISING AND AN APPEALING STORE ENVIRONMENT TO ATTRACT CONSUMERS, WHICH REQUIRES CONTINUING

INVESTMENTS BY RETAILERS. RETAILERS WHO EXPERIENCE FINANCIAL DIFFICULTIES MAY FAIL TO MAKE SUCH INVESTMENTS OR DELAY THEM, RESULTING IN REDUCED SALES OF AND ORDERS FOR OUR PRODUCTS.

CONSOLIDATION OF RETAILERS OR CONCENTRATION OF RETAIL MARKET SHARE AMONG A FEW RETAILERS MAY INCREASE AND CONCENTRATE OUR CREDIT RISK, AND IMPAIR OUR ABILITY TO SELL OUR PRODUCTS.

THE ATHLETIC FOOTWEAR, APPAREL, AND EQUIPMENT RETAIL MARKETS IN SOME COUNTRIES ARE DOMINATED BY A FEW LARGE ATHLETIC FOOTWEAR, APPAREL, AND EQUIPMENT

RETAILERS WITH MANY STORES. THESE SIGNIFICANT RETAILERS HAVE BEEN INCREASING THEIR MARKET SHARE BY EXPANDING THROUGH ACQUISITIONS AND CONSTRUCTION OF ADDITIONAL STORES. THESE SITUATIONS CONCENTRATE OUR CREDIT RISK IN A RELATIVELY SMALL NUMBER OF

RETAILERS, AND, IF ANY OF THESE RETAILERS WERE TO EXPERIENCE A SHORTAGE OF LIQUIDITY, IT WOULD INCREASE THE RISK THAT THEIR OUTSTANDING PAYABLES TO US MAY NOT BE PAID. IN ADDITION, INCREASING MARKET SHARE CONCENTRATION AMONG ONE OR A FEW RETAILERS

IN A PARTICULAR COUNTRY OR REGION INCREASES THE RISK THAT IF ANY ONE OF THEM SUBSTANTIALLY REDUCES THEIR PURCHASES OF OUR PRODUCTS, WE MAY BE UNABLE TO FIND A SUFFICIENT NUMBER OF OTHER RETAIL OUTLETS FOR OUR PRODUCTS TO SUSTAIN THE SAME LEVEL OF

SALES AND REVENUES.

FAILURE TO ADEQUATELY PROTECT OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS.

WE UTILIZE TRADEMARKS ON NEARLY ALL OF OUR PRODUCTS AND BELIEVE THAT HAVING DISTINCTIVE MARKS THAT

ARE READILY IDENTIFIABLE IS AN IMPORTANT FACTOR IN CREATING A MARKET FOR OUR GOODS, IN IDENTIFYING US, AND IN DISTINGUISHING OUR GOODS FROM THE GOODS OF OTHERS. WE CONSIDER OUR NIKE

®

AND

SWOOSH DESIGN

®

TRADEMARKS TO BE AMONG OUR MOST VALUABLE ASSETS AND WE HAVE REGISTERED THESE TRADEMARKS IN OVER 100 COUNTRIES. IN ADDITION, WE OWN MANY OTHER TRADEMARKS THAT WE UTILIZE IN

MARKETING OUR PRODUCTS. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR TRADEMARKS, PATENTS, AND OTHER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS ARE IMPORTANT TO OUR BRAND, OUR SUCCESS AND OUR COMPETITIVE POSITION. WE PERIODICALLY DISCOVER PRODUCTS THAT ARE COUNTERFEIT REPRODUCTIONS OF OUR

PRODUCTS OR THAT OTHERWISE INFRINGE ON OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS. IF WE ARE UNSUCCESSFUL IN CHALLENGING A PARTYS PRODUCTS ON THE BASIS OF TRADEMARK OR DESIGN OR UTILITY PATENT INFRINGEMENT, CONTINUED SALES OF THESE PRODUCTS COULD

ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR SALES AND OUR BRAND AND RESULT IN THE SHIFT OF CONSUMER PREFERENCE AWAY FROM OUR PRODUCTS. THE ACTIONS WE TAKE TO ESTABLISH AND PROTECT TRADEMARKS, PATENTS, AND OTHER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS MAY NOT BE ADEQUATE TO PREVENT

IMITATION OF OUR PRODUCTS BY OTHERS OR TO PREVENT OTHERS FROM SEEKING TO BLOCK SALES OF OUR PRODUCTS AS VIOLATIONS OF PROPRIETARY RIGHTS.

IN ADDITION, THE LAWS OF CERTAIN FOREIGN COUNTRIES MAY NOT PROTECT INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS TO THE SAME EXTENT AS DO THE LAWS OF THE UNITED STATES. WE MAY FACE SIGNIFICANT EXPENSES AND LIABILITY IN CONNECTION WITH THE PROTECTION OF OUR

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES, AND IF WE ARE UNABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY PROTECT OUR RIGHTS OR RESOLVE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY CONFLICTS WITH OTHERS, OUR BUSINESS OR FINANCIAL CONDITION MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

WE ARE SUBJECT TO PERIODIC LITIGATION AND OTHER REGULATORY PROCEEDINGS, WHICH COULD RESULT IN UNEXPECTED EXPENSE OF

TIME AND RESOURCES.

WE ARE A DEFENDANT FROM TIME TO TIME IN LAWSUITS AND REGULATORY ACTIONS RELATING TO OUR BUSINESS. DUE TO THE

INHERENT UNCERTAINTIES OF LITIGATION AND REGULATORY PROCEEDINGS, WE CANNOT ACCURATELY PREDICT THE ULTIMATE OUTCOME OF ANY SUCH PROCEEDINGS. AN UNFAVORABLE OUTCOME COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS. IN ADDITION, ANY SIGNIFICANT LITIGATION IN THE FUTURE, REGARDLESS OF ITS MERITS, COULD DIVERT MANAGEMENTS ATTENTION FROM OUR OPERATIONS AND RESULT IN SUBSTANTIAL LEGAL FEES.

OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS INVOLVE INHERENT RISKS WHICH COULD RESULT IN HARM TO OUR BUSINESS.

VIRTUALLY ALL OF OUR ATHLETIC FOOTWEAR AND APPAREL IS MANUFACTURED OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES, AND THE MAJORITY OF OUR PRODUCTS ARE SOLD OUTSIDE OF THE

UNITED STATES. ACCORDINGLY, WE ARE SUBJECT TO THE RISKS GENERALLY ASSOCIATED WITH GLOBAL TRADE AND DOING BUSINESS ABROAD, WHICH INCLUDE FOREIGN LAWS AND REGULATIONS, VARYING CONSUMER PREFERENCES ACROSS GEOGRAPHIC REGIONS, POLITICAL UNREST,

DISRUPTIONS OR DELAYS IN CROSS-BORDER SHIPMENTS AND CHANGES IN ECONOMIC CONDITIONS IN COUNTRIES IN WHICH WE MANUFACTURE OR SELL PRODUCTS. IN ADDITION, DISEASE OUTBREAKS, TERRORIST ACTS AND MILITARY CONFLICT HAVE INCREASED THE RISKS OF DOING BUSINESS

ABROAD. THESE FACTORS, AMONG OTHERS, COULD AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO MANUFACTURE PRODUCTS OR PROCURE MATERIALS, OUR ABILITY TO IMPORT PRODUCTS, OUR ABILITY TO SELL PRODUCTS IN INTERNATIONAL MARKETS, AND OUR COST OF DOING BUSINESS. IF ANY OF THESE OR

OTHER FACTORS MAKE THE CONDUCT OF BUSINESS IN A PARTICULAR COUNTRY UNDESIRABLE OR IMPRACTICAL, OUR BUSINESS COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED. IN ADDITION, MANY OF OUR IMPORTED PRODUCTS ARE SUBJECT TO DUTIES, TARIFFS OR QUOTAS THAT AFFECT THE COST AND

QUANTITY OF VARIOUS TYPES OF GOODS IMPORTED INTO THE UNITED STATES AND OTHER COUNTRIES. ANY COUNTRY IN WHICH OUR PRODUCTS ARE PRODUCED OR SOLD MAY ELIMINATE, ADJUST OR IMPOSE NEW QUOTAS, DUTIES, TARIFFS, SAFEGUARD MEASURES, ANTI-DUMPING DUTIES,

CARGO RESTRICTIONS TO PREVENT TERRORISM, RESTRICTIONS ON THE TRANSFER OF CURRENCY, OR OTHER CHARGES OR RESTRICTIONS, ANY OF WHICH COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE FLUCTUATIONS COULD RESULT IN HIGHER COSTS AND DECREASED MARGINS.

A MAJORITY OF OUR PRODUCTS ARE SOLD OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES. AS A RESULT, WE CONDUCT TRANSACTIONS IN VARIOUS CURRENCIES, WHICH INCREASES OUR EXPOSURE

TO FLUCTUATIONS IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES RELATIVE TO THE U.S. DOLLAR. OUR INTERNATIONAL REVENUES AND EXPENSES GENERALLY ARE DERIVED FROM SALES AND OPERATIONS IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES, AND THESE REVENUES AND EXPENSES COULD BE AFFECTED BY

CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS, INCLUDING AMOUNTS RECORDED IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES AND TRANSLATED INTO U.S. DOLLARS FOR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL REPORTING. CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE FLUCTUATIONS COULD ALSO DISRUPT THE BUSINESS OF THE INDEPENDENT MANUFACTURERS THAT

PRODUCE OUR PRODUCTS BY MAKING THEIR PURCHASES OF RAW MATERIALS MORE EXPENSIVE AND MORE DIFFICULT TO FINANCE. FOREIGN CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

WE ENGAGE IN HEDGING ACTIVITIES TO MITIGATE THE IMPACT OF FOREIGN CURRENCIES ON OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS.

SEE NOTE 16 TO OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, RISK

MANAGEMENT AND DERIVATIVES.

OUR HEDGING ACTIVITIES ARE DESIGNED TO REDUCE AND DELAY, BUT NOT TO COMPLETELY ELIMINATE, THE EFFECTS OF FOREIGN CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS. FACTORS THAT COULD AFFECT THE EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR HEDGING ACTIVITIES INCLUDE

ACCURACY OF SALES FORECASTS, VOLATILITY OF CURRENCY MARKETS, AND THE AVAILABILITY OF HEDGING INSTRUMENTS. SINCE THE HEDGING ACTIVITIES ARE DESIGNED TO REDUCE VOLATILITY, THEY NOT ONLY REDUCE THE NEGATIVE IMPACT OF A STRONGER U.S. DOLLAR, BUT THEY

ALSO REDUCE THE POSITIVE IMPACT OF A WEAKER U.S. DOLLAR. OUR FUTURE FINANCIAL RESULTS COULD BE SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTED BY THE VALUE OF THE U.S. DOLLAR IN RELATION TO THE FOREIGN CURRENCIES IN WHICH WE CONDUCT BUSINESS. THE DEGREE TO WHICH OUR

FINANCIAL RESULTS ARE AFFECTED FOR ANY GIVEN TIME PERIOD WILL DEPEND IN PART UPON OUR HEDGING ACTIVITIES.

OUR PRODUCTS ARE SUBJECT TO RISKS

ASSOCIATED WITH OVERSEAS SOURCING, MANUFACTURING, AND FINANCING.

THE PRINCIPAL MATERIALS USED IN OUR APPAREL PRODUCTS 

NATURAL AND SYNTHETIC FABRICS AND THREADS, PLASTIC AND METAL HARDWARE, AND SPECIALIZED PERFORMANCE FABRICS DESIGNED TO REPEL RAIN, RETAIN HEAT, OR EFFICIENTLY TRANSPORT BODY MOISTURE  ARE AVAILABLE IN COUNTRIES WHERE OUR MANUFACTURING TAKES

PLACE. THE PRINCIPAL MATERIALS USED IN

14

TABLE OF CONTENTS

OUR FOOTWEAR PRODUCTS  NATURAL AND SYNTHETIC RUBBER, PLASTIC COMPOUNDS, FOAM CUSHIONING MATERIALS, NYLON, LEATHER, CANVAS AND POLYURETHANE FILMS 

ARE ALSO LOCALLY AVAILABLE TO MANUFACTURERS. NIKE CONTRACTORS AND SUPPLIERS BUY RAW MATERIALS IN BULK.

THERE COULD BE A SIGNIFICANT

DISRUPTION IN THE SUPPLY OF FABRICS OR RAW MATERIALS FROM CURRENT SOURCES OR, IN THE EVENT OF A DISRUPTION, WE MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO LOCATE ALTERNATIVE SUPPLIERS OF MATERIALS OF COMPARABLE QUALITY AT AN ACCEPTABLE PRICE, OR AT ALL. IN ADDITION, WE

CANNOT BE CERTAIN THAT OUR UNAFFILIATED MANUFACTURERS WILL BE ABLE TO FILL OUR ORDERS IN A TIMELY MANNER. IF WE EXPERIENCE SIGNIFICANT INCREASES IN DEMAND, OR NEED TO REPLACE AN EXISTING MANUFACTURER, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT ADDITIONAL

SUPPLIES OF FABRICS OR RAW MATERIALS OR ADDITIONAL MANUFACTURING CAPACITY WILL BE AVAILABLE WHEN REQUIRED ON TERMS THAT ARE ACCEPTABLE TO US, OR AT ALL, OR THAT ANY SUPPLIER OR MANUFACTURER WOULD ALLOCATE SUFFICIENT CAPACITY TO US IN ORDER TO MEET

OUR REQUIREMENTS. IN ADDITION, EVEN IF WE ARE ABLE TO EXPAND EXISTING OR FIND NEW MANUFACTURING OR SOURCES OF MATERIALS, WE MAY ENCOUNTER DELAYS IN PRODUCTION AND ADDED COSTS AS A RESULT OF THE TIME IT TAKES TO TRAIN OUR SUPPLIERS AND MANUFACTURERS

IN OUR METHODS, PRODUCTS, QUALITY CONTROL STANDARDS, AND LABOR, HEALTH AND SAFETY STANDARDS. ANY DELAYS, INTERRUPTION OR INCREASED COSTS IN THE SUPPLY OF MATERIALS OR MANUFACTURE OF OUR PRODUCTS COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR ABILITY TO MEET

RETAIL CUSTOMER AND CONSUMER DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS AND RESULT IN LOWER REVENUES AND NET INCOME BOTH IN THE SHORT AND LONG TERM.

BECAUSE

INDEPENDENT MANUFACTURERS MANUFACTURE A MAJORITY OF OUR PRODUCTS OUTSIDE OF OUR PRINCIPAL SALES MARKETS, OUR PRODUCTS MUST BE TRANSPORTED BY THIRD PARTIES OVER LARGE GEOGRAPHIC DISTANCES. DELAYS IN THE SHIPMENT OR DELIVERY OF OUR PRODUCTS DUE TO THE

AVAILABILITY OF TRANSPORTATION, WORK STOPPAGES, PORT STRIKES, INFRASTRUCTURE CONGESTION, OR OTHER FACTORS, AND COSTS AND DELAYS ASSOCIATED WITH TRANSITIONING BETWEEN MANUFACTURERS, COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE. IN ADDITION,

MANUFACTURING DELAYS OR UNEXPECTED DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS MAY REQUIRE US TO USE FASTER, BUT MORE EXPENSIVE, TRANSPORTATION METHODS SUCH AS AIRCRAFT, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR PROFIT MARGINS. THE COST OF FUEL IS A SIGNIFICANT COMPONENT IN

MANUFACTURING AND TRANSPORTATION COSTS, SO INCREASES IN THE PRICE OF PETROLEUM PRODUCTS CAN ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR PROFIT MARGINS.

IN

ADDITION, SOJITZ AMERICA PERFORMS SIGNIFICANT IMPORT-EXPORT FINANCING SERVICES FOR MOST OF THE NIKE BRAND PRODUCTS SOLD OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES, EUROPE, MIDDLE EAST, AFRICA AND JAPAN, EXCLUDING PRODUCTS PRODUCED AND SOLD IN THE SAME COUNTRY.

ANY FAILURE OF SOJITZ AMERICA TO PROVIDE THESE SERVICES OR ANY FAILURE OF SOJITZ AMERICAS BANKS COULD DISRUPT OUR ABILITY TO ACQUIRE PRODUCTS FROM OUR SUPPLIERS AND TO DELIVER PRODUCTS TO OUR CUSTOMERS OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES, EUROPE,

MIDDLE EAST, AFRICA, AND JAPAN. SUCH A DISRUPTION COULD RESULT IN CANCELLED ORDERS THAT WOULD ADVERSELY AFFECT SALES AND PROFITABILITY.

OUR SUCCESS

DEPENDS ON OUR GLOBAL DISTRIBUTION FACILITIES.

WE DISTRIBUTE OUR PRODUCTS TO CUSTOMERS DIRECTLY FROM THE FACTORY AND THROUGH

DISTRIBUTION CENTERS LOCATED THROUGHOUT THE WORLD. OUR ABILITY TO MEET CUSTOMER EXPECTATIONS, MANAGE INVENTORY, COMPLETE SALES AND ACHIEVE OBJECTIVES FOR OPERATING EFFICIENCIES DEPENDS ON THE PROPER OPERATION OF OUR DISTRIBUTION FACILITIES, THE

DEVELOPMENT OR EXPANSION OF ADDITIONAL DISTRIBUTION CAPABILITIES, AND THE TIMELY PERFORMANCE OF SERVICES BY THIRD PARTIES (INCLUDING THOSE INVOLVED IN SHIPPING PRODUCT TO AND FROM OUR DISTRIBUTION FACILITIES). OUR DISTRIBUTION FACILITIES COULD BE

INTERRUPTED BY INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY PROBLEMS AND DISASTERS SUCH AS EARTHQUAKES OR FIRES. ANY SIGNIFICANT FAILURE IN OUR DISTRIBUTION FACILITIES COULD RESULT IN AN ADVERSE AFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS. WE MAINTAIN BUSINESS INTERRUPTION INSURANCE, BUT IT

MAY NOT ADEQUATELY PROTECT US FROM ANY ADVERSE EFFECTS THAT COULD BE CAUSED BY SIGNIFICANT DISRUPTIONS IN OUR DISTRIBUTION FACILITIES.

WE RELY

SIGNIFICANTLY ON INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY IN OUR SUPPLY CHAIN, AND ANY FAILURE, INADEQUACY, INTERRUPTION OR SECURITY FAILURE OF THAT TECHNOLOGY COULD HARM OUR ABILITY TO EFFECTIVELY OPERATE OUR BUSINESS.

WE ARE HEAVILY DEPENDENT ON INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS ACROSS OUR SUPPLY CHAIN, INCLUDING FOR DESIGN, PRODUCTION, FORECASTING, ORDERING,

MANUFACTURING, TRANSPORTATION, SALES, AND DISTRIBUTION. OUR ABILITY TO EFFECTIVELY MANAGE AND MAINTAIN OUR INVENTORY AND TO SHIP PRODUCTS TO CUSTOMERS ON A TIMELY BASIS DEPENDS SIGNIFICANTLY ON

15

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE RELIABILITY OF THESE SUPPLY CHAIN SYSTEMS. OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS, AS PART OF THE ONGOING INITIATIVE TO UPGRADE OUR WORLDWIDE SUPPLY CHAIN, WE HAVE

IMPLEMENTED NEW SYSTEMS IN ALL OF OUR GEOGRAPHICAL REGIONS IN WHICH WE OPERATE. OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS, WE WILL WORK TO CONTINUE TO ENHANCE THE SYSTEMS AND RELATED PROCESSES IN OUR GLOBAL OPERATIONS. THE FAILURE OF THESE SYSTEMS TO OPERATE

EFFECTIVELY, PROBLEMS WITH TRANSITIONING TO UPGRADED OR REPLACEMENT SYSTEMS, OR A BREACH IN SECURITY OF THESE SYSTEMS COULD CAUSE DELAYS IN PRODUCT FULFILLMENT AND REDUCED EFFICIENCY OF OUR OPERATIONS, AND IT COULD REQUIRE SIGNIFICANT CAPITAL

INVESTMENTS TO REMEDIATE THE PROBLEM, AND MAY HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS MAY

BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED IF SUBSTANTIAL INVESTMENTS IN BUSINESSES AND OPERATIONS FAIL TO PRODUCE EXPECTED RETURNS.

FROM TIME TO TIME,

WE MAY INVEST IN BUSINESS INFRASTRUCTURE, ACQUISITIONS OF NEW BUSINESSES, AND EXPANSION OF EXISTING BUSINESSES, SUCH AS OUR RETAIL OPERATIONS, WHICH REQUIRE SUBSTANTIAL CASH INVESTMENTS AND MANAGEMENT ATTENTION. WE BELIEVE COST EFFECTIVE INVESTMENTS

ARE ESSENTIAL TO BUSINESS GROWTH AND PROFITABILITY. HOWEVER, SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS ARE SUBJECT TO TYPICAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES INHERENT IN ACQUIRING OR EXPANDING A BUSINESS. THE FAILURE IF ANY SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT TO PROVIDE THE RETURNS OR

PROFITABILITY THAT WE EXPECT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS AND DIVERT MANAGEMENT ATTENTION FROM MORE PROFITABLE BUSINESS OPERATIONS.

WE DEPEND ON KEY PERSONNEL, THE LOSS OF WHOM WOULD HARM OUR BUSINESS.

OUR FUTURE SUCCESS WILL

DEPEND IN PART ON THE CONTINUED SERVICE OF KEY EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AND PERSONNEL. THE LOSS OF THE SERVICES OF ANY KEY INDIVIDUALS COULD HARM US. OUR FUTURE SUCCESS ALSO DEPENDS ON OUR ABILITY TO IDENTIFY, ATTRACT AND RETAIN ADDITIONAL QUALIFIED

PERSONNEL. COMPETITION FOR EMPLOYEES IN OUR INDUSTRY IS INTENSE AND WE MAY NOT BE SUCCESSFUL IN ATTRACTING AND RETAINING SUCH PERSONNEL.

THE SALE OF

A LARGE NUMBER OF SHARES HELD BY OUR CHAIRMAN COULD DEPRESS THE MARKET PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK.

PHILIP H. KNIGHT, CO-FOUNDER AND

CHAIRMAN OF OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS, BENEFICIALLY OWNS OVER 90 PERCENT OF OUR CLASS A COMMON STOCK. IF ALL OF HIS CLASS A COMMON STOCK WERE CONVERTED INTO CLASS B COMMON STOCK, MR. KNIGHT WOULD OWN OVER 18 PERCENT OF OUR CLASS B COMMON STOCK. THESE

SHARES ARE AVAILABLE FOR RESALE, SUBJECT TO THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE U.S. SECURITIES LAWS. THE SALE OR PROSPECT OF THE SALE OF A SUBSTANTIAL NUMBER OF THESE SHARES COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE MARKET PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK.

ANTI-TAKEOVER PROVISIONS MAY IMPAIR AN ACQUISITION OF THE COMPANY OR REDUCE THE PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK.

THERE ARE PROVISIONS OF OUR ARTICLES OF INCORPORATION AND OREGON LAW THAT ARE INTENDED TO PROTECT SHAREHOLDER INTERESTS BY PROVIDING THE BOARD OF

DIRECTORS A MEANS TO ATTEMPT TO DENY COERCIVE TAKEOVER ATTEMPTS OR TO NEGOTIATE WITH A POTENTIAL ACQUIRER IN ORDER TO OBTAIN MORE FAVORABLE TERMS. SUCH PROVISIONS INCLUDE A CONTROL SHARE ACQUISITION STATUTE, A FREEZEOUT STATUTE, TWO CLASSES OF STOCK

THAT VOTE SEPARATELY ON CERTAIN ISSUES, AND THE FACT THAT THE HOLDERS OF CLASS A COMMON STOCK SHARES ELECT THREE-FOURTHS OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS ROUNDED DOWN TO THE NEXT WHOLE NUMBER. HOWEVER, SUCH PROVISIONS COULD DISCOURAGE, DELAY OR PREVENT AN

UNSOLICITED MERGER, ACQUISITION OR OTHER CHANGE IN CONTROL OF OUR COMPANY THAT SOME SHAREHOLDERS MIGHT BELIEVE TO BE IN THEIR BEST INTERESTS, OR IN WHICH SHAREHOLDERS MIGHT RECEIVE A PREMIUM FOR THEIR COMMON STOCK OVER THE PREVAILING MARKET PRICE.

THESE PROVISIONS COULD ALSO DISCOURAGE PROXY CONTESTS FOR CONTROL OF THE COMPANY.

WE MAY FAIL TO MEET ANALYST EXPECTATIONS, WHICH COULD CAUSE THE

PRICE OF OUR STOCK TO DECLINE.

OUR COMMON STOCK IS TRADED PUBLICLY, AND AT ANY GIVEN TIME VARIOUS SECURITIES ANALYSTS FOLLOW OUR

FINANCIAL RESULTS AND ISSUE REPORTS ON US. THESE REPORTS INCLUDE INFORMATION ABOUT OUR HISTORICAL FINANCIAL RESULTS AS WELL AS THE ANALYSTS ESTIMATES OF OUR FUTURE PERFORMANCE. THE ANALYSTS ESTIMATES ARE BASED UPON THEIR OWN OPINIONS AND

16

TABLE OF CONTENTS

ARE OFTEN DIFFERENT FROM OUR ESTIMATES OR EXPECTATIONS. IF OUR OPERATING RESULTS ARE BELOW THE ESTIMATES OR EXPECTATIONS OF PUBLIC MARKET ANALYSTS AND

INVESTORS, OUR STOCK PRICE COULD DECLINE. IN THE PAST, SECURITIES CLASS ACTION LITIGATION HAS BEEN BROUGHT AGAINST NIKE AND OTHER COMPANIES FOLLOWING A DECLINE IN THE MARKET PRICE OF THEIR SECURITIES. IF OUR STOCK PRICE IS VOLATILE, WE MAY BECOME

INVOLVED IN THIS TYPE OF LITIGATION IN THE FUTURE. ANY LITIGATION COULD RESULT IN SUBSTANTIAL COSTS AND A DIVERSION OF MANAGEMENTS ATTENTION AND RESOURCES THAT ARE NEEDED TO SUCCESSFULLY RUN OUR BUSINESS.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

OVERVIEW

NIKE DESIGNS,

DEVELOPS AND MARKETS HIGH QUALITY FOOTWEAR, APPAREL, EQUIPMENT AND ACCESSORY PRODUCTS WORLDWIDE. WE ARE THE LARGEST SELLER OF ATHLETIC FOOTWEAR AND APPAREL IN THE WORLD AND SELL OUR PRODUCTS PRIMARILY THROUGH A COMBINATION OF RETAIL ACCOUNTS,

NIKE-OWNED RETAIL, INCLUDING STORES AND E-COMMERCE, AND INDEPENDENT DISTRIBUTORS, FRANCHISEES AND LICENSEES IN THE UNITED STATES AND WORLDWIDE. OUR GOAL IS TO DELIVER VALUE TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS BY BUILDING A PROFITABLE GLOBAL PORTFOLIO OF BRANDED

FOOTWEAR, APPAREL, EQUIPMENT AND ACCESSORIES BUSINESSES. OUR STRATEGY IS TO CREATE LONG-TERM REVENUE GROWTH BY CREATING COMPELLING CONSUMER EXPERIENCES BY CREATING AND DELIVERING INNOVATIVE, MUST HAVE PRODUCTS; DEEP PERSONAL CONNECTIONS

WITH OUR BRANDS; AND COMPELLING RETAIL PRESENTATION.

WE STRIVE TO CONVERT REVENUE GROWTH TO SHAREHOLDER VALUE BY DRIVING OPERATING

EXCELLENCE IN SEVERAL KEY AREAS.



MAKING OUR SUPPLY CHAIN A COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE, THROUGH OPERATIONAL DISCIPLINE



REDUCING PRODUCT COSTS THROUGH A CONTINUED FOCUS ON LEAN MANUFACTURING AND PRODUCT DESIGN THAT STRIVES TO ELIMINATE WASTE



IMPROVING SELLING AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE PRODUCTIVITY BY FOCUSING ON INVESTMENTS THAT DRIVE ECONOMIC RETURNS IN THE FORM OF INCREMENTAL REVENUE AND GROSS

MARGIN, AND LEVERAGING EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE ACROSS OUR PORTFOLIO OF BRANDS TO ELIMINATE DUPLICATIVE COSTS



IMPROVING WORKING CAPITAL EFFICIENCY



DEPLOYING CAPITAL EFFECTIVELY TO CREATE VALUE FOR OUR SHAREHOLDERS

BY EXECUTING THIS STRATEGY, WE AIM TO DELIVER THE FOLLOWING LONG-TERM FINANCIAL GOALS.



HIGH SINGLE-DIGIT REVENUE GROWTH;



MID-TEENS EARNINGS PER SHARE GROWTH;

21

TABLE OF CONTENTS



INCREASED RETURN ON INVESTED CAPITAL AND ACCELERATED CASH FLOWS; AND



CONSISTENT RESULTS THROUGH EFFECTIVE MANAGEMENT OF OUR DIVERSIFIED PORTFOLIO OF BUSINESSES.

IN FISCAL 2008 WE MET OR EXCEEDED THESE FINANCIAL GOALS. OUR REVENUES GREW 14% TO $18.6 BILLION, NET INCOME GREW 26% TO $1.9 BILLION, AND WE DELIVERED

DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE OF $3.74, A 28% INCREASE VERSUS FISCAL 2007. THESE REPORTED RESULTS INCLUDED COMBINED GAINS FROM THE SALE OF OUR STARTER BRAND AND NIKE BAUER HOCKEY BUSINESSES OF $35.4 MILLION, NET OF TAX, IN FISCAL 2008 AND THE GAIN

RECOGNIZED ON THE SALE-LEASEBACK OF THE OREGON FOOTWEAR DISTRIBUTION CENTER OF $10.0 MILLION, NET OF TAX, IN FISCAL 2007, ONE-TIME TAX BENEFITS OF $105.4 MILLION AND $25.5 MILLION RECOGNIZED IN FISCAL 2008 AND 2007, RESPECTIVELY, OPERATIONAL LOSSES

OF $13.3 MILLION, NET OF TAX, FROM UMBRO, WHICH WE ACQUIRED IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF FISCAL 2008, AND A $9.6 MILLION GAIN, NET OF TAX, FROM THE CONVERSE ARBITRATION RULING SETTLEMENT IN FISCAL 2007. WE ESTIMATE THAT THE COMBINATION OF FAVORABLE

TRANSLATION OF FOREIGN CURRENCY-DENOMINATED PROFITS FROM INTERNATIONAL BUSINESSES AND THE FOREIGN CURRENCY LOSSES INCLUDED IN OTHER (EXPENSE) INCOME, NET RESULTED IN A YEAR-OVER-YEAR INCREASE IN CONSOLIDATED INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES OF

APPROXIMATELY 6%.

FOR THE YEAR, THE INCREASE IN NET INCOME WAS HIGHER THAN OUR RATE OF REVENUE GROWTH DUE TO A REDUCTION IN OUR EFFECTIVE

TAX RATE AND IMPROVED GROSS MARGINS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER SELLING AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES AS A PERCENTAGE OF REVENUE. FISCAL 2008 RESULTS WERE POSITIVELY AFFECTED BY A REDUCTION IN OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE OF 7.4 PERCENTAGE POINTS AS

COMPARED TO FISCAL 2007, PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF THE $105.4 MILLION ONE-TIME TAX BENEFIT RECEIVED IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2008. ALSO REFLECTED IN THE YEAR-OVER-YEAR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE IMPROVEMENT WAS A REDUCTION IN OUR ONGOING EFFECTIVE TAX

RATE RESULTING FROM OUR PROFITS EARNED OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES; OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATES FOR THESE OPERATIONS ARE GENERALLY LOWER THAN THE U.S. STATUTORY RATE. GROSS MARGINS FOR THE YEAR GREW 110 BASIS POINTS VERSUS THE PRIOR YEAR AS INVENTORY

MANAGEMENT AND STRATEGIC PRICE INCREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER PRODUCT COSTS AND INCREASED CLOSE-OUT SALES. THE INCREASE IN SELLING AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES WAS ATTRIBUTABLE TO HIGHER INVESTMENTS IN GROWTH DRIVERS SUCH AS ATHLETE AND

SPORT TEAM ENDORSERS OF OUR PRODUCTS, SPENDING AROUND MAJOR SPORTING EVENTS, KEY PRODUCT INITIATIVES, INVESTMENTS IN COMPANY OWNED RETAIL AND NON-NIKE BRAND BUSINESSES AS WELL AS NORMAL WAGE INCREASES. OUR EARNINGS PER SHARE FOR THE YEAR GREW AT A

HIGHER RATE THAN NET INCOME GIVEN LOWER OUTSTANDING SHARES DUE TO REPURCHASES MADE UNDER OUR SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM. IN ADDITION, WE INCREASED CASH FLOW FROM OPERATIONS AND CONTINUED TO RETURN LARGER AMOUNTS OF CASH TO SHAREHOLDERS THROUGH HIGHER

DIVIDENDS AND INCREASED CASH PAID FOR SHARE REPURCHASES. OUR RETURN ON INVESTED CAPITAL INCREASED AS COMPARED TO FISCAL 2007. ALTHOUGH WE MAY NOT MEET ALL OF THE FINANCIAL GOALS OUTLINED ABOVE IN ANY PARTICULAR FISCAL QUARTER OR FISCAL YEAR, WE

CONTINUE TO BELIEVE THESE ARE APPROPRIATE LONG-TERM GOALS.

FISCAL 2008 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2007

DURING FISCAL 2008, CHANGES IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES CONTRIBUTED 5 PERCENTAGE POINTS OF CONSOLIDATED REVENUE GROWTH. STRONG DEMAND FOR NIKE

BRAND PRODUCTS CONTINUED TO DRIVE REVENUE GROWTH, AS ALL FOUR OF OUR GEOGRAPHIC REGIONS AND, ON A CONSOLIDATED BASIS, ALL THREE OF OUR PRODUCT BUSINESS UNITS DELIVERED REVENUE GROWTH. THE U.S. REGION CONTRIBUTED NEARLY 2 PERCENTAGE POINTS OF THE

CONSOLIDATED REVENUE GROWTH FOR FISCAL 2008. EXCLUDING THE EFFECTS OF CHANGES IN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES, OUR INTERNATIONAL REGIONS CONTRIBUTED NEARLY 7 PERCENTAGE POINTS OF THE CONSOLIDATED REVENUE GROWTH FOR FISCAL 2008, AS ALL OF OUR

INTERNATIONAL REGIONS POSTED HIGHER REVENUES. OUR OTHER BUSINESSES, COMPRISED OF RESULTS FROM COLE HAAN, CONVERSE, EXETER BRANDS GROUP (WHOSE PRIMARY BUSINESS WAS THE STARTER BRAND BUSINESS WHICH WAS SOLD ON DECEMBER 17, 2007), HURLEY

INTERNATIONAL, NIKE BAUER HOCKEY (WHICH WAS SOLD ON APRIL 17, 2008), NIKE GOLF, AND UMBRO (WHICH WAS ACQUIRED ON MARCH 3, 2008) CONTRIBUTED THE REMAINING CONSOLIDATED CONSTANT-CURRENCY REVENUE GROWTH, AS COLE HAAN, CONVERSE, HURLEY AND

NIKE GOLF POSTED HIGHER YEAR-OVER-YEAR REVENUES.

BY PRODUCT GROUP, OUR WORLDWIDE NIKE BRAND FOOTWEAR REVENUE GREW 14% AND CONTRIBUTED MORE

THAN $1.2 BILLION OF INCREMENTAL REVENUE FOR FISCAL 2008. OUR WORLDWIDE NIKE BRANDED APPAREL AND EQUIPMENT BUSINESSES REPORTED REVENUE GROWTH OF 14% AND 10% FOR THE YEAR, RESPECTIVELY, AND COMBINED ADDED APPROXIMATELY $750 MILLION OF INCREMENTAL

REVENUE. OUR OTHER BUSINESSES REPORTED REVENUE GROWTH OF 15% AND COMBINED ADDED MORE THAN $330 MILLION OF INCREMENTAL REVENUE.

FISCAL

2007 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2006

DURING FISCAL 2007, CHANGES IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES CONTRIBUTED 2 PERCENTAGE POINTS OF

INTERNATIONAL REGIONS EACH CONTRIBUTED MORE THAN 2.5 PERCENTAGE POINTS TO THE CONSOLIDATED REVENUE GROWTH FOR FISCAL 2007. SALES IN OUR OTHER BUSINESSES CONTRIBUTED THE REMAINING 2 PERCENTAGE POINTS OF THE CONSOLIDATED CONSTANT-CURRENCY REVENUE

GROWTH, AS EACH BUSINESS WITHIN THE GROUP POSTED HIGHER REVENUES.

BY PRODUCT GROUP, OUR WORLDWIDE NIKE BRAND FOOTWEAR REVENUE GREW 7% AND

CONTRIBUTED NEARLY $550 MILLION OF INCREMENTAL REVENUE FOR FISCAL 2007. OUR WORLDWIDE NIKE BRANDED APPAREL AND EQUIPMENT BUSINESSES REPORTED REVENUE GROWTH OF 10% AND 12% FOR THE YEAR, RESPECTIVELY, AND COMBINED ADDED MORE THAN $500 MILLION OF

TABLE OF CONTENTS

FISCAL 2008 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2007

DURING FISCAL 2008, THE PRIMARY FACTORS CONTRIBUTING TO THE 110 BASIS POINT INCREASE IN THE CONSOLIDATED GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE VERSUS THE PRIOR YEAR

WERE AS FOLLOWS.

(1)

HIGHER FOOTWEAR IN-LINE GROSS PRICING MARGINS, MOST NOTABLY IN THE U.S. REGION, PRIMARILY DUE TO STRATEGIC PRICE INCREASES;

(2)

IMPROVED HEDGE RATES RELATIVE TO THE PRIOR YEAR, PRIMARILY IN THE EUROPE, MIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA (EMEA) REGION;

(3)

HIGHER FOOTWEAR CLOSE-OUT NET PRICING MARGINS, MOST NOTABLY IN THE EMEA REGION, PRIMARILY DUE TO BETTER INVENTORY MANAGEMENT.

THE FACTORS DRIVING AN INCREASED GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER APPAREL IN-LINE GROSS PRICING MARGINS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY HIGHER

PRODUCT COSTS, MOST NOTABLY IN THE U.S. AND EMEA REGIONS, AND INCREASED APPAREL CLOSE-OUT SALES, PRIMARILY IN THE U.S. REGION.

IMPROVED HEDGE RATES RELATIVE TO THE PRIOR YEAR, PRIMARILY IN THE EMEA AND ASIA PACIFIC REGIONS;

(3)

BETTER INVENTORY MANAGEMENT, MOST NOTABLY IN OUR ASIA PACIFIC REGION; AND

TABLE OF CONTENTS

FISCAL 2008 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2007

IN FISCAL 2008, SELLING AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES INCREASED AS A PERCENTAGE OF REVENUES BY 120 BASIS POINTS, DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY STRATEGIC INVESTMENTS

IN BOTH DEMAND CREATION AND OPERATING OVERHEAD. CHANGES IN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES INCREASED SELLING AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE GROWTH BY FOUR PERCENTAGE POINTS.

ON A CONSTANT-CURRENCY BASIS, DEMAND CREATION EXPENSE INCREASED 15% VERSUS THE PRIOR YEAR. THE YEAR-OVER-YEAR INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO INVESTMENTS IN ATHLETE AND SPORT TEAM ENDORSERS OF OUR PRODUCTS,

SPENDING AROUND MAJOR SPORTING EVENTS INCLUDING THE 2008 OLYMPICS IN BEIJING AND THE EUROPEAN FOOTBALL CHAMPIONSHIPS, KEY PRODUCT INITIATIVES SUCH AS MENS TRAINING IN THE U.S. AND RETAIL PRESENTATION.

EXCLUDING THE EFFECTS OF CHANGES IN EXCHANGE RATES, OPERATING OVERHEAD INCREASED 14% VERSUS THE PRIOR YEAR. THE INCREASE IN OPERATING OVERHEAD WAS

ATTRIBUTABLE TO INVESTMENTS IN GROWTH DRIVERS SUCH AS NIKE-OWNED RETAIL, NON-NIKE BRAND BUSINESSES, EMERGING MARKETS AND NORMAL WAGE INFLATION AND PERFORMANCE COMPENSATION.

WE BELIEVE TOTAL SELLING AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES WILL GROW FASTER THAN OUR RATE OF REVENUE GROWTH IN FISCAL 2009 DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY STRATEGIC

INVESTMENTS IN DEMAND CREATION, INCLUDING SPENDING AROUND THE 2008 OLYMPICS IN BEIJING AND THE EUROPEAN FOOTBALL CHAMPIONSHIPS AND INCREASED INVESTMENTS IN ATHLETE AND TEAM ENDORSERS OF OUR PRODUCTS.

FISCAL 2007 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2006

IN FISCAL 2007, SELLING AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES INCREASED AS A PERCENTAGE OF REVENUES BY 90 BASIS POINTS; HOWEVER, EXCLUDING THE $141.9 MILLION PRE-TAX CHARGE RELATING TO THE CHANGE IN ACCOUNTING FOR STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION, SELLING

AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE AS A PERCENTAGE OF REVENUES WAS CONSISTENT WITH THE PRIOR YEAR.

ON A CONSTANT-CURRENCY BASIS, DEMAND CREATION EXPENSE INCREASED 7% VERSUS THE PRIOR YEAR. THE YEAR-OVER-YEAR INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO INVESTMENTS IN THE NIKE AIR

®

,

NIKE+, NIKE PRO, AND FORCE BASKETBALL CAMPAIGNS. FOR FISCAL YEAR 2007, CONSTANT-CURRENCY GROWTH IN DEMAND CREATION EXPENSE WAS CONSISTENT WITH OUR CONSTANT-CURRENCY REVENUE GROWTH.

EXCLUDING STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE AND THE EFFECTS OF CHANGES IN EXCHANGE RATES, OPERATING OVERHEAD INCREASED 7%, WHICH WAS IN LINE WITH OUR

CONSTANT-CURRENCY REVENUE GROWTH. THE INCREASE IN OPERATING OVERHEAD WAS ATTRIBUTABLE TO INVESTMENTS IN GROWTH DRIVERS SUCH AS NIKE-OWNED RETAIL AND NON-NIKE BRANDS, AS WELL AS NORMAL WAGE INFLATION AND PERFORMANCE BASED COMPENSATION.

IN FISCAL 2008, WE ESTIMATE THAT THE COMBINATION OF FAVORABLE TRANSLATION OF FOREIGN CURRENCY-DENOMINATED PROFITS FROM INTERNATIONAL BUSINESSES AND THE FOREIGN CURRENCY LOSSES INCLUDED IN OTHER (EXPENSE) INCOME, NET

RESULTED IN A YEAR-OVER-YEAR INCREASE IN CONSOLIDATED INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES OF APPROXIMATELY $122 MILLION.

FISCAL 2007 COMPARED TO

FOR FISCAL 2007, OTHER (EXPENSE) INCOME, NET WAS PRIMARILY COMPRISED OF THE $14.7 MILLION GAIN ON THE SALE-LEASEBACK OF OUR

OREGON FOOTWEAR DISTRIBUTION CENTER AND THE $14.2 MILLION BENEFIT FROM THE SETTLEMENT OF THE CONVERSE ARBITRATION, OFFSET BY FOREIGN CURRENCY HEDGE LOSSES. THE FOREIGN CURRENCY HEDGE LOSSES RECOGNIZED IN FISCAL 2007 PRIMARILY REFLECT THE

STRENGTHENING OF THE EURO SINCE WE ENTERED INTO THESE HEDGE CONTRACTS.

THE CHANGE IN OTHER (EXPENSE) INCOME, NET VERSUS THE PRIOR YEAR

PERIOD WAS PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF FOREIGN CURRENCY HEDGE LOSSES IN FISCAL 2007, WHICH WERE MORE THAN OFFSET BY THE CONVERSE ARBITRATION SETTLEMENT AND GAIN ON THE SALE OF OUR OREGON FOOTWEAR DISTRIBUTION CENTER DISCUSSED ABOVE, COMPARED TO FOREIGN

CURRENCY HEDGE GAINS IN FISCAL 2006, WHICH WERE MORE THAN OFFSET BY THE $51.9 MILLION CHARGE TAKEN DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER AS A RESULT OF THE CONVERSE ARBITRATION. THE GAIN ON THE SALE OF THE OREGON FOOTWEAR DISTRIBUTION CENTER IS REFLECTED IN THE

IN FISCAL 2007, THE NET FOREIGN CURRENCY HEDGE LOSSES DISCUSSED ABOVE WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY FAVORABLE U.S. DOLLAR

TRANSLATION OF FOREIGN CURRENCY DENOMINATED PROFITS, MOST NOTABLY IN THE EMEA REGION. WE ESTIMATE THAT THE COMBINATION OF NET FOREIGN CURRENCY HEDGE LOSSES IN OTHER (EXPENSE) INCOME, NET, AND THE FAVORABLE U.S. DOLLAR TRANSLATION OF FOREIGN CURRENCY

ONE-TIME TAX BENEFIT OF $105.4 MILLION. ALSO REFLECTED IN THE YEAR-OVER-YEAR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE IMPROVEMENT WAS A REDUCTION IN OUR ON-GOING EFFECTIVE TAX RATE RESULTING FROM OUR PROFITS EARNED OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES; OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATES FOR

THESE OPERATIONS ARE GENERALLY LOWER THAN THE U.S. STATUTORY RATE.

IN FISCAL 2007, OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE REFLECTS TAX BENEFITS FROM OUR OPERATIONS OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES; OUR TAX RATE ON THESE OPERATIONS IS GENERALLY

BENEFIT FOR FISCAL 2006 AND THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2007, FAVORABLY IMPACTED OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR FISCAL 2007.

FUTURES ORDERS

WORLDWIDE FUTURES AND ADVANCE ORDERS FOR FOOTWEAR AND APPAREL SCHEDULED FOR DELIVERY FROM JUNE THROUGH NOVEMBER 2008 WERE MORE THAN 11% HIGHER THAN SUCH

ORDERS REPORTED FOR THE COMPARABLE PERIOD OF FISCAL 2007. THIS FUTURES GROWTH RATE IS CALCULATED BASED UPON OUR FORECASTS OF THE ACTUAL EXCHANGE RATES UNDER WHICH OUR REVENUES WILL BE TRANSLATED DURING THIS PERIOD, WHICH APPROXIMATE CURRENT SPOT

RATES. THE NET EFFECT FROM CHANGES IN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES CONTRIBUTED APPROXIMATELY 3 PERCENTAGE POINTS TO THIS REPORTED FUTURES GROWTH VERSUS THE SAME PERIOD IN THE PRIOR YEAR. EXCLUDING THIS CURRENCY IMPACT, UNIT SALES VOLUME INCREASES FOR

BOTH FOOTWEAR AND APPAREL DROVE THE GROWTH IN OVERALL FUTURES AND ADVANCE ORDERS. THE REPORTED FUTURES AND ADVANCE ORDERS GROWTH IS NOT NECESSARILY INDICATIVE OF OUR EXPECTATION OF REVENUE GROWTH DURING THIS PERIOD. THIS IS BECAUSE THE MIX OF ORDERS

CAN SHIFT BETWEEN ADVANCE/FUTURES AND AT-ONCE ORDERS. IN ADDITION, EXCHANGE RATE FLUCTUATIONS AS WELL AS DIFFERING LEVELS OF ORDER CANCELLATIONS AND DISCOUNTS CAN CAUSE DIFFERENCES IN THE COMPARISONS BETWEEN FUTURES AND ADVANCE ORDERS, AND ACTUAL

REVENUES. MOREOVER, A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR REVENUE IS NOT DERIVED FROM FUTURES AND ADVANCE ORDERS, INCLUDING AT-ONCE AND CLOSE-OUT SALES OF NIKE FOOTWEAR AND APPAREL, WHOLESALE SALES OF EQUIPMENT, COLE HAAN, CONVERSE, HURLEY, UMBRO, NIKE GOLF

AND RETAIL SALES ACROSS ALL BRANDS.

FISCAL 2008 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2007

DURING FISCAL 2008, THE INCREASE IN U.S. FOOTWEAR REVENUE WAS THE RESULT OF LOW-SINGLE DIGIT GROWTH IN UNIT SALES AND A SLIGHT INCREASE IN THE AVERAGE

SELLING PRICE PER PAIR. THE GROWTH IN UNIT SALES AND AVERAGE SELLING PRICE PER PAIR WAS DRIVEN BY HIGHER DEMAND FOR OUR NIKE BRAND SPORTSWEAR PRODUCTS AND BRAND JORDAN PRODUCTS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECREASE IN DEMAND FOR OUR NIKE BRAND BASKETBALL

PRODUCTS. THE INCREASE IN AVERAGE SELLING PRICE PER PAIR WAS ALSO ATTRIBUTABLE TO STRATEGIC PRICE INCREASES AND AN INCREASED SALES MIX OF HIGHER PRICED NIKE BRAND SPORTSWEAR AND BRAND JORDAN PRODUCTS.

THE YEAR-OVER-YEAR INCREASE IN U.S. APPAREL REVENUES DURING FISCAL 2008 REFLECTED AN INCREASE IN UNIT SALES, MOSTLY OFFSET BY LOWER AVERAGE SELLING

PRICES. THE INCREASE IN UNIT SALES WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY HIGHER CLOSE-OUT SALES AND INCREASED DEMAND FOR NIKE BRAND SPORTS PERFORMANCE PRODUCTS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER UNIT SALES OF SPORTSWEAR AND BRAND JORDAN PRODUCTS. AVERAGE SELLING PRICES

DECREASED PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF A HIGHER MIX OF CLOSE-OUT SALES.

THE YEAR-OVER-YEAR DECREASE IN U.S. EQUIPMENT REVENUES DURING FISCAL

2008 WAS PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF LOWER UNIT SALES OF ACCESSORY PRODUCTS AND FEWER CLOSE-OUT SALES.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

PRE-TAX INCOME FOR THE U.S. REGION GREW AT A SLOWER RATE THAN REVENUE IN FISCAL 2008 AS A RESULT OF

HIGHER DEMAND CREATION AND OPERATING OVERHEAD EXPENSES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER GROSS MARGINS, DRIVEN BY FOOTWEAR. THE INCREASE IN DEMAND CREATION WAS DRIVEN BY HIGHER SPORTS MARKETING EXPENSES AND INVESTMENTS IN THE RETAIL PRESENTATION OF OUR

KEY WHOLESALE CUSTOMERS. THE INCREASE IN OPERATING OVERHEAD WAS ATTRIBUTABLE TO INVESTMENTS IN NIKE-OWNED RETAIL AND NORMAL WAGE INFLATION.

FISCAL 2007 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2006

DURING FISCAL 2007, THE INCREASE IN U.S. FOOTWEAR REVENUE WAS ATTRIBUTABLE TO HIGH

SINGLE-DIGIT GROWTH IN UNIT SALES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A SLIGHT DECREASE IN THE AVERAGE SELLING PRICE PER PAIR. THE GROWTH IN UNIT SALES WAS DRIVEN BY HIGHER DEMAND FOR OUR NIKE BRAND SPORTSWEAR PRODUCTS; KIDS PRODUCT, INCLUDING BOYS AND GIRLS

SPORTSWEAR; BRAND JORDAN PRODUCTS; AND MENS RUNNING PRODUCTS, DUE TO THE GROWTH OF OUR NIKE+ PERFORMANCE MODELS. THE DECREASE IN AVERAGE SELLING PRICE PER PAIR COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR WAS THE RESULT OF A HIGHER MIX OF OFF-PRICE PRODUCTS,

COMBINED WITH GROWTH IN LOWER PRICED KIDS PRODUCT.

THE YEAR-OVER-YEAR INCREASE IN U.S. APPAREL REVENUES DURING FISCAL 2007 REFLECTED

MID SINGLE-DIGIT GROWTH IN UNIT SALES COMBINED WITH A LOW SINGLE-DIGIT INCREASE IN AVERAGE PRICE PER UNIT. THE INCREASE IN UNIT SALES VERSUS THE PRIOR YEAR WAS DRIVEN BY DOUBLE-DIGIT GROWTH IN NIKE BRAND SPORT PERFORMANCE APPAREL, WHILE THE

IMPROVEMENT IN AVERAGE SELLING PRICES WAS DRIVEN BY TEAM AND LICENSED APPAREL AND BRAND JORDAN PRODUCTS.

PRE-TAX INCOME FOR THE U.S.

REGION GREW AT A SLOWER RATE THAN REVENUE IN FISCAL 2007 AS A RESULT OF LOWER GROSS MARGINS. THE GROSS MARGIN DECLINE WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO A HIGHER LEVEL OF CLOSE-OUT SALES AND SALES DISCOUNTS COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR, MOST NOTABLY IN OUR

FOOTWEAR BUSINESS. SELLING AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES WERE HIGHER THAN FISCAL 2006, BUT REPRESENTED A LOWER PERCENTAGE OF REVENUE DUE TO OPERATING OVERHEAD LEVERAGE.

FISCAL 2008 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2007

FOR THE EMEA REGION, CHANGES IN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES CONTRIBUTED 11 PERCENTAGE POINTS OF THE REVENUE GROWTH DURING FISCAL 2008. NEARLY ALL MARKETS

WITHIN THE REGION INCREASED REVENUES DURING THE YEAR. THE EMERGING MARKETS IN THE REGION GREW NEARLY 25%, DRIVEN BY STRONG RESULTS IN RUSSIA, TURKEY AND SOUTH AFRICA. INCREASES IN NORTHERN EUROPE AND THE U.K. ALSO CONTRIBUTED SIGNIFICANTLY TO THE

REVENUE GROWTH.

EXCLUDING CHANGES IN EXCHANGE RATES, FOOTWEAR REVENUES INCREASED 8 PERCENTAGE POINTS DURING FISCAL 2008 COMPARED TO THE

PRIOR YEAR. THE INCREASE IN FOOTWEAR REVENUE WAS ATTRIBUTABLE TO DOUBLE-DIGIT GROWTH IN UNIT SALES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A LOW SINGLE-DIGIT DECREASE IN THE AVERAGE SELLING PRICE PER PAIR. THE GROWTH IN UNIT SALES WAS DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY HIGHER DEMAND

FOR OUR NIKE BRAND SOCCER AND SPORTSWEAR PRODUCTS. THE DECREASE IN AVERAGE SELLING PRICE PER PAIR RESULTED FROM A SHIFT IN PRODUCT MIX FROM HIGHER PRICED TO LOWER PRICED PRODUCT MODELS, MOST NOTABLY WITHIN OUR NIKE BRAND SPORTSWEAR PRODUCT LINES.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

ON A CURRENCY NEUTRAL BASIS, EMEA APPAREL REVENUE INCREASED 8 PERCENTAGE POINTS DURING FISCAL 2008

COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR, PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF INCREASED UNIT SALES AND A SLIGHT INCREASE IN AVERAGE SELLING PRICES. THE INCREASE IN UNIT SALES WAS DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY INCREASED DEMAND FOR SPORTS PERFORMANCE PRODUCTS, MOST NOTABLY SOCCER.

THE INCREASE IN PRE-TAX INCOME FOR THE EMEA REGION DURING FISCAL 2008 COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY THE INCREASE IN

REVENUES, FAVORABLE FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION AND A HIGHER GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER SELLING AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES AS A PERCENTAGE OF REVENUES. THE GROSS MARGIN IMPROVEMENT IN FISCAL 2008 WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE

TO IMPROVED YEAR-OVER-YEAR HEDGE RATES AND IMPROVED MARGINS ON CLOSE-OUT PRODUCT. THE INCREASE IN SELLING AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES WAS DRIVEN BY AN INCREASE IN DEMAND CREATION SPENDING, PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO SPENDING AROUND THE EUROPEAN

FOOTBALL CHAMPIONSHIPS. AS A RESULT OF RETAIL EXPANSION AND OVERALL BUSINESS GROWTH ACROSS THE REGION, OPERATING OVERHEAD EXPENSES INCREASED FOR THE YEAR, BUT AT A SLOWER RATE THAN REVENUE GROWTH.

FISCAL 2007 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2006

FOR THE EMEA REGION, CHANGES IN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES CONTRIBUTED 6 PERCENTAGE POINTS OF THE REVENUE GROWTH DURING FISCAL 2007. EXCLUDING CHANGES IN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES, ALL MARKETS WITHIN THE REGION EXCEPT THE U.K. AND FRANCE

INCREASED REVENUES DURING THE YEAR. THE EMERGING MARKETS IN THE REGION GREW OVER 30%, DRIVEN BY STRONG RESULTS IN GREECE, RUSSIA, TURKEY AND SOUTH AFRICA. INCREASES IN NORTHERN EUROPE, ITALY AND SPAIN ALSO CONTRIBUTED SIGNIFICANTLY TO THE REVENUE

GROWTH. AFTER EXPERIENCING CHALLENGING RETAIL CONDITIONS IN THE U.K. AND FRANCE DURING FISCAL 2007, WE HAVE STARTED TO SEE SIGNS OF IMPROVEMENT IN THESE MARKETS, INCLUDING YEAR-OVER-YEAR FUTURES GROWTH.

EXCLUDING CHANGES IN EXCHANGE RATES, FOOTWEAR REVENUES INCREASED 1 PERCENTAGE POINT DURING FISCAL 2007 COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR. THE INCREASE IN

FOOTWEAR REVENUE WAS ATTRIBUTABLE TO LOW SINGLE-DIGIT GROWTH IN UNIT SALES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A SLIGHT DECREASE IN THE AVERAGE SELLING PRICE PER PAIR. THE GROWTH IN UNIT SALES WAS DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY HIGHER DEMAND FOR OUR NIKE BRAND SPORT CULTURE

PRODUCTS, MOST NOTABLY METRO AND OUTDOOR PRODUCTS. THE GROWTH IN UNIT SALES MORE THAN OFFSET A DECLINE IN THE AVERAGE SELLING PRICE PER PAIR, WHICH RESULTED FROM A SHIFT IN PRODUCT MIX FROM HIGHER PRICED TO LOWER PRICED PRODUCT STYLES,

COMBINED WITH AN INCREASE IN CLOSE-OUT SALES.

EXCLUDING CHANGES IN EXCHANGE RATES, APPAREL REVENUES INCREASED 7 PERCENTAGE POINTS DURING

FISCAL 2007 COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR. THE YEAR-OVER-YEAR INCREASE REFLECTED HIGH SINGLE-DIGIT GROWTH IN UNIT SALES, DRIVEN BY BOTH SPORTS CULTURE AND SPORTS PERFORMANCE PRODUCTS, COMBINED WITH A LOW SINGLE-DIGIT INCREASE IN AVERAGE PRICE PER UNIT.

THE INCREASE IN PRE-TAX INCOME FOR THE EMEA REGION DURING FISCAL 2007 COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY THE INCREASE IN

REVENUES AND FAVORABLE FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A LOWER GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE AND HIGHER SELLING AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES, WHICH ON A CURRENCY-NEUTRAL BASIS, INCREASED 4 PERCENTAGE POINTS VERSUS FISCAL 2006. THE LOWER

GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE IN FISCAL 2007 WAS ATTRIBUTABLE TO AN INCREASE IN WAREHOUSING COSTS AND LOWER IN-LINE NET PRICING MARGINS, PRIMARILY IN FOOTWEAR, ATTRIBUTABLE TO SALES DISCOUNTS, HIGHER PRODUCT COSTS AND A SHIFT IN PRODUCT MIX TO LOWER

PRICED MODELS. THE INCREASE IN SELLING AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY AN INCREASE IN OPERATING OVERHEAD, MOST NOTABLY NORMAL WAGE INFLATION AND GROWTH IN THE EMERGING MARKETS, COMBINED WITH A SLIGHT INCREASE IN DEMAND CREATION.

FISCAL 2008 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2007

IN THE ASIA PACIFIC REGION, CHANGES IN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES CONTRIBUTED 6 PERCENTAGE POINTS OF REVENUE GROWTH FOR FISCAL 2008. NEARLY ALL COUNTRIES

ACROSS THE REGION DELIVERED REVENUE GROWTH ON A CURRENCY NEUTRAL BASIS. CHINA CONTINUES TO BE THE PRIMARY DRIVER OF GROWTH WITHIN THE REGION AS FISCAL 2008 REVENUES INCREASED 50% ON A CURRENCY-NEUTRAL BASIS, DRIVEN BY THE EXPANSION IN BOTH THE

NUMBER OF STORES SELLING NIKE PRODUCT AND SALES THROUGH EXISTING STORES. CONSTANT-CURRENCY REVENUES IN JAPAN INCREASED AT A LOW SINGLE DIGIT RATE DURING FISCAL 2008.

FOOTWEAR REVENUE GROWTH FOR FISCAL 2008 REFLECTED INCREASED UNIT SALES, MOST NOTABLY IN CHINA, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER AVERAGE SELLING PRICES DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY A SHIFT IN MIX FROM HIGHER PRICED TO LOWER PRICED

MODELS. THE YEAR-OVER-YEAR INCREASE IN APPAREL REVENUE WAS DRIVEN BY INCREASED DEMAND IN CHINA.

THE INCREASE IN PRE-TAX INCOME FOR THE

ASIA PACIFIC REGION FOR FISCAL 2008 WAS DRIVEN BY HIGHER REVENUES, IMPROVED GROSS MARGINS AND FAVORABLE FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION, WHICH MORE THAN OFFSET SLIGHTLY HIGHER SELLING AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES AS A PERCENTAGE OF REVENUE. THE GROSS

MARGIN IMPROVEMENT VERSUS THE PRIOR YEAR WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY REDUCED WAREHOUSING COSTS, IMPROVED YEAR-OVER-YEAR CURRENCY HEDGE RATES AND IMPROVED MARGINS ON CLOSE-OUT PRODUCT. THE INCREASE IN SELLING AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES DURING FISCAL

2008 WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO SPENDING AROUND THE 2008 OLYMPICS IN BEIJING. OVERALL BUSINESS GROWTH ACROSS THE REGION COMBINED WITH RETAIL EXPANSION, PRIMARILY IN CHINA, ALSO CONTRIBUTED TO AN INCREASE IN OPERATING OVERHEAD EXPENSES, WHICH GREW

SLIGHTLY SLOWER THAN REVENUES.

FISCAL 2007 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2006

IN THE ASIA PACIFIC REGION, CHANGES IN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES CONTRIBUTED 1 PERCENTAGE POINT OF REVENUE GROWTH FOR FISCAL 2007. WHILE THE MAJORITY OF

COUNTRIES WITHIN THE REGION REPORTED DOUBLE-DIGIT SALES INCREASES FOR THE YEAR, CHINA CONTINUES TO BE THE PRIMARY DRIVER OF GROWTH WITHIN THE REGION, AS REVENUES INCREASED NEARLY 26% ON A CURRENCY-NEUTRAL BASIS. THE REVENUE GROWTH IN CHINA IS

PRIMARILY DUE TO EXPANSION IN BOTH THE NUMBER OF STORES SELLING NIKE PRODUCT, AS WELL AS SALES THROUGH EXISTING DOORS. CONSTANT-CURRENCY REVENUES IN JAPAN INCREASED ONLY SLIGHTLY DURING FISCAL 2007. DESPITE SUSTAINED SOFTNESS IN THE JAPAN MARKET, WE

ARE STARTING TO SEE POSITIVE SIGNS, INCLUDING HIGHER GROSS MARGINS, IMPROVEMENTS IN SELL THROUGH AT RETAIL AND IMPROVING FUTURES CONVERSION TRENDS.

THE GROWTH IN FOOTWEAR REVENUE FOR FISCAL 2007 REFLECTED INCREASED UNIT SALES, MOST NOTABLY IN CHINA AND KOREA, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER AVERAGE SELLING PRICES, WHICH RESULTED PRIMARILY FROM STRATEGIES TO IMPROVE CONSUMER VALUE IN JAPAN

AND KOREA, COMBINED WITH A CHANGE IN THE MIX OF PRODUCTS SOLD ACROSS THE REGION. THE YEAR-OVER-YEAR INCREASE IN APPAREL REVENUE WAS ALSO DRIVEN BY INCREASED DEMAND IN CHINA AND KOREA.

THE INCREASE IN PRE-TAX INCOME FOR THE ASIA PACIFIC REGION FOR FISCAL 2007 WAS DRIVEN BY HIGHER REVENUES, IMPROVED GROSS MARGINS AND FAVORABLE FOREIGN

CURRENCY TRANSLATION, WHICH MORE THAN OFFSET HIGHER SELLING AND

TABLE OF CONTENTS

ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES. THE GROSS MARGIN IMPROVEMENT VERSUS THE PRIOR YEAR WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY BETTER INVENTORY MANAGEMENT, IMPROVED YEAR-OVER-YEAR

HEDGE RATES AND REDUCED WAREHOUSING COSTS. THE IMPROVEMENT IN MARGINS WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER SALES INCENTIVES, MOST NOTABLY IN JAPAN, COMBINED WITH EFFORTS TO IMPROVE CONSUMER VALUE IN JAPAN AND KOREA. THE INCREASE IN SELLING AND

ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES DURING FISCAL 2007 WAS ATTRIBUTABLE TO INCREASED INVESTMENTS IN DEMAND CREATION, MOST NOTABLY THE JUST DO IT AND FORCE BASKETBALL CAMPAIGNS. OVERALL BUSINESS GROWTH ACROSS THE REGION, COMBINED WITH RETAIL EXPANSION IN CHINA

AND KOREA, ALSO CONTRIBUTED TO AN INCREASE IN OPERATING OVERHEAD EXPENSES.

FISCAL 2008 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2007

IN THE AMERICAS REGION, CHANGES IN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES CONTRIBUTED 7 PERCENTAGE POINTS OF REVENUE GROWTH FOR FISCAL 2008. EXCLUDING CHANGES IN FOREIGN

CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES, THE AMERICAS REGION REPORTED GROWTH IN ALL MARKETS, LED BY ARGENTINA, MEXICO AND BRAZIL.

THE INCREASE IN PRE-TAX

INCOME FOR FISCAL 2008 VERSUS THE PRIOR YEAR WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO HIGHER REVENUES, IMPROVED GROSS MARGINS AND OPERATING OVERHEAD LEVERAGE, COMBINED WITH FAVORABLE FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION. THESE FACTORS WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER

DEMAND CREATION SPENDING AS A PERCENTAGE OF REVENUE. THE GROSS MARGIN IMPROVEMENT WAS DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY HIGHER IN-LINE NET PRICING MARGINS RESULTING FROM A BETTER MIX OF PRODUCTS SOLD AND FEWER DISCOUNTS OFFERED IN FISCAL 2008 COMPARED TO FISCAL

2007. THE INCREASE IN DEMAND CREATION SPENDING DURING FISCAL 2008 WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO INVESTMENTS IN SPORTS MARKETING, MOST NOTABLY IN SOCCER, BRAND EVENTS INCLUDING SPENDING AROUND RUN AMERICAS III AND INVESTMENTS IN THE RETAIL

PRESENTATION OF NIKE + AND NIKE PRO PRODUCTS.

FISCAL 2007 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2006

IN THE AMERICAS REGION, CHANGES IN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES CONTRIBUTED 1 PERCENTAGE POINT OF REVENUE GROWTH FOR FISCAL 2007. EXCLUDING CHANGES IN FOREIGN

CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES, GROWTH IN MOST MARKETS WITHIN THE REGION, LED BY CONSTANT-CURRENCY REVENUE GROWTH OF 29% IN ARGENTINA, MORE THAN OFFSET SOFTER RESULTS IN BRAZIL. WHILE CURRENCY-NEUTRAL FOOTWEAR AND EQUIPMENT REVENUES INCREASED 6% AND 15%,

RESPECTIVELY, VERSUS THE PRIOR YEAR, APPAREL REVENUES DECREASED 4% AS A RESULT OF TOUGH WORLD CUP COMPARISONS. WE EXPECT TO RETURN TO APPAREL REVENUE GROWTH IN FISCAL 2008 AS A RESULT OF MOVING FROM A LICENSED TO A WHOLESALE APPAREL DISTRIBUTION

MODEL IN BRAZIL.

THE INCREASE IN PRE-TAX INCOME FOR FISCAL 2007 VERSUS THE PRIOR YEAR WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO HIGHER REVENUES AND

IMPROVED GROSS MARGINS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER SELLING AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES. THE GROSS MARGIN IMPROVEMENT WAS DRIVEN BY HIGHER IN-LINE NET PRICING MARGINS RESULTING FROM FEWER DISCOUNTS BEING OFFERED IN FISCAL 2007 COMPARED TO FISCAL

2006, COMBINED WITH A CHANGE IN PRODUCT MIX. THE INCREASE IN SELLING AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES DURING FISCAL 2007 WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO INVESTMENTS IN DEMAND CREATION, MOST NOTABLY THE RUN AMERICAS II AND WOMENS FITNESS CAMPAIGNS,

THE WORLD CUP AND RETAIL RESOURCES.

FISCAL 2008 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2007

THE INCREASE IN OTHER BUSINESS REVENUES WAS DRIVEN BY HIGHER REVENUES ACROSS ALL BUSINESSES, MOST NOTABLY CONVERSE AND NIKE GOLF. IN FISCAL 2008, REVENUES

AT CONVERSE INCREASED MORE THAN 29% VERSUS THE PRIOR YEAR TO APPROXIMATELY $729 MILLION, DRIVEN BY STRONG CONSUMER DEMAND IN THE UNITED STATES AND INTERNATIONALLY, WHILE NIKE GOLF GREW 12% TO NEARLY $725 MILLION. REVENUES AT COLE HAAN INCREASED 6%

TO $496 MILLION, DRIVEN BY STRONG RESULTS AT COMPANY-OWNED RETAIL STORES. REVENUES AT HURLEY INCREASED 14% TO $171 MILLION.

DURING FISCAL

2008, GROWTH AT CONVERSE AND NIKE GOLF, COMBINED WITH MARGIN IMPROVEMENTS ACROSS MOST BUSINESSES DROVE THE YEAR-OVER-YEAR INCREASE IN PRE-TAX INCOME. FISCAL 2007 PRE-TAX INCOME INCLUDED A $14.2 MILLION BENEFIT RELATING TO THE SETTLEMENT OF AN

ARBITRATION RULING INVOLVING CONVERSE AND A FORMER SOUTH AMERICAN LICENSEE. FISCAL 2008 PRE-TAX INCOME FOR OUR OTHER BUSINESSES WOULD HAVE INCREASED APPROXIMATELY 18% VERSUS FISCAL 2007 EXCLUDING THIS FAVORABLE SETTLEMENT.

AS PART OF OUR LONG TERM GROWTH STRATEGY, WE CONTINUALLY EVALUATE OUR EXISTING PORTFOLIO OF BUSINESSES AS WELL AS NEW BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES TO ENSURE

THE COMPANY IS INVESTING IN THOSE BUSINESSES WITH THE LARGEST GROWTH POTENTIAL AND HIGHEST RETURNS. ON MARCH 3, 2008 WE COMPLETED THE ACQUISITION OF 100% OF THE OUTSTANDING SHARES OF UMBRO PLC (UMBRO), A LEADING UNITED KINGDOM-BASED

GLOBAL SOCCER BRAND, FOR A PURCHASE PRICE OF £290.5 MILLION IN CASH (APPROXIMATELY $576.4 MILLION), INCLUSIVE OF DIRECT TRANSACTION COSTS. THIS ACQUISITION IS INTENDED TO SIGNIFICANTLY STRENGTHEN OUR MARKET POSITION IN THE UNITED KINGDOM

AND EXPAND NIKES GLOBAL LEADERSHIP IN SOCCER, A KEY AREA OF GROWTH FOR THE COMPANY. THIS ACQUISITION ALSO PROVIDES SCALED POSITIONS IN EMERGING SOCCER MARKETS SUCH AS CHINA, RUSSIA AND BRAZIL. THE RESULTS OF UMBROS OPERATIONS HAVE BEEN

INCLUDED IN THE COMPANYS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND IN THE OTHER OPERATING SEGMENT SINCE THE DATE OF ACQUISITION. UMBRO, WHICH WAS LISTED ON THE LONDON STOCK EXCHANGE PRIOR TO OUR ACQUISITION, REPORTED IN THEIR 2006 ANNUAL REPORT

THAT REVENUES FOR CALENDAR YEAR 2006 WERE APPROXIMATELY $276 MILLION (£149.5 MILLION), AND ESTIMATED THAT THE COMBINATION OF UMBROS CALENDAR YEAR 2006 WHOLESALE REVENUE AND ESTIMATED SALES REVENUE EARNED BY UMBROS LICENSEES FROM

THE SALE OF UMBRO PRODUCTS TOTALED APPROXIMATELY $755 MILLION (£409.4 MILLION).

FOLLOWING A STRATEGIC REVIEW OF THE COMPANYS

EXISTING BUSINESS PORTFOLIO, WE CONCLUDED THAT THE STARTER AND BAUER HOCKEY BUSINESSES DID NOT ALIGN WITH OUR LONG-TERM GROWTH PRIORITIES. ON DECEMBER 17, 2007 WE COMPLETED THE SALE OF THE STARTER BRAND BUSINESS FOR $60 MILLION IN CASH. ON

APRIL 17, 2008 WE COMPLETED THE SALE OF THE BAUER HOCKEY BUSINESS FOR NET PROCEEDS OF $189.2 MILLION AFTER WORKING CAPITAL ADJUSTMENTS. THESE TRANSACTIONS RESULTED IN GAINS OF APPROXIMATELY $28.6 MILLION AND $32.0 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, WHICH

ARE REFLECTED IN THE CORPORATE LINE IN OUR SEGMENT PRESENTATION OF PRE-TAX INCOME IN THE

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (NOTE 17  OPERATING SEGMENTS).

FISCAL 2007 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2006

THE INCREASE IN OTHER BUSINESS REVENUES FOR FISCAL 2007 COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN THE PRIOR YEAR WAS DRIVEN BY DOUBLE-DIGIT REVENUE GROWTH ACROSS NEARLY ALL BUSINESSES, LED BY CONVERSE AND NIKE GOLF. IN FISCAL 2007, REVENUES AT

CONVERSE INCREASED MORE THAN 20% VERSUS THE PRIOR YEAR TO OVER $550 MILLION, DRIVEN BY STRONG CONSUMER DEMAND IN THE UNITED STATES AND INTERNATIONALLY, WHILE NIKE GOLF GREW 12% TO NEARLY $650 MILLION.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

DURING FISCAL 2007, IMPROVED PROFITABILITY AT CONVERSE, DRIVEN BY INCREASED WHOLESALE REVENUES IN THE

UNITED STATES AND GROWTH IN OUR INTERNATIONAL LICENSING BUSINESS, COMBINED WITH GROWTH AT NIKE GOLF, CONTRIBUTED TO THE INCREASE IN PRE-TAX INCOME VERSUS FISCAL 2006. FISCAL 2007 RESULTS ALSO INCLUDE THE BENEFIT OF THE $14.2 MILLION SETTLEMENT OF

THE ARBITRATION RULING INVOLVING CONVERSE AND A FORMER SOUTH AMERICAN LICENSEE. THIS DISPUTE WAS SETTLED DURING THE FIRST QUARTER ENDED AUGUST 31, 2006.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

FISCAL 2008 CASH FLOW ACTIVITY

CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATIONS WAS APPROXIMATELY $1.9 BILLION IN BOTH FISCAL 2008 AND FISCAL 2007. OUR PRIMARY SOURCE OF OPERATING CASH FLOW IN FISCAL 2008

WAS NET INCOME OF $1.9 BILLION. ADJUSTMENTS FOR NON-CASH DEPRECIATION AND STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION WERE OFFSET BY INCREASES IN DEFERRED INCOME TAXES AS WELL AS INVESTMENTS IN WORKING CAPITAL AND OTHER ASSETS AND LIABILITIES TO SUPPORT GROWTH IN THE

BUSINESS. THE INCREASE IN WORKING CAPITAL DURING FISCAL 2008 WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO AN INCREASE IN INVENTORIES AND ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY INCREASES IN ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND ACCRUED LIABILITIES. THE INCREASE IN ACCOUNTS

RECEIVABLE IS ATTRIBUTABLE TO HIGHER SALES IN THE LAST QUARTER OF 2008. THE INCREASE IN INVENTORIES REFLECTS YEAR-OVER-YEAR GROWTH IN REPORTED FUTURES AND HIGHER INVENTORIES TO SUPPORT THE EXPANSION OF NIKE-OWNED RETAIL STORES, SLIGHTLY OFFSET BY

BETTER INVENTORY MANAGEMENT. THE INCREASE IN ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND ACCRUED LIABILITIES WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE TIMING OF PAYMENTS AND INVENTORY RECEIPTS COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR.

CASH USED BY INVESTING ACTIVITIES WAS $0.4 BILLION DURING FISCAL 2008, COMPARED TO $0.1 BILLION PROVIDED BY INVESTING ACTIVITIES DURING FISCAL 2007. THE

YEAR-OVER-YEAR INCREASE IN CASH USED BY INVESTING ACTIVITIES WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO OUR ACQUISITION OF UMBRO FOR APPROXIMATELY $0.6 BILLION OFFSET BY PROCEEDS FROM THE DIVESTITURES OF OUR NIKE BAUER HOCKEY AND STARTER BRAND BUSINESSES OF $0.2 BILLION.

CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES WAS $1.2 BILLION DURING FISCAL 2008, COMPARED TO $1.1 BILLION USED IN FISCAL 2007. THE INCREASE VERSUS

FISCAL 2007 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO AN INCREASE IN SHARE REPURCHASES AND DIVIDENDS PAID, DISCUSSED BELOW, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECREASE IN PAYMENTS OF LONG TERM DEBT AS WE MADE A $250 MILLION REPAYMENT OF CORPORATE BONDS IN FISCAL 2007.

IN FISCAL 2008, WE PURCHASED APPROXIMATELY 20.6 MILLION SHARES OF NIKES CLASS B COMMON STOCK FOR $1.2 BILLION. AS OF THE END OF FISCAL 2008,

WE HAVE REPURCHASED 38.6 MILLION SHARES FOR $2.1 BILLION UNDER THE $3 BILLION PROGRAM APPROVED BY OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS IN JUNE 2006. WE EXPECT TO FUND SHARE REPURCHASES FROM OPERATING CASH FLOW, EXCESS CASH AND/OR DEBT. THE TIMING AND THE

ULTIMATE AMOUNT OF SHARES PURCHASED UNDER THE PROGRAMS WILL BE DICTATED BY OUR CAPITAL NEEDS AND STOCK MARKET CONDITIONS.

DIVIDENDS

DECLARED PER SHARE OF COMMON STOCK FOR FISCAL 2008 WERE $0.875, COMPARED TO $0.71 IN FISCAL 2007. WE HAVE PAID A DIVIDEND EVERY QUARTER SINCE FEBRUARY 1984. OUR CURRENT DIVIDEND POLICY IS TO PROVIDE AN ANNUAL DIVIDEND EQUAL TO 20% TO 30% OF THE

TRAILING TWELVE-MONTHS EARNINGS PER SHARE, PAID OUT ON A QUARTERLY BASIS. WE REVIEW OUR DIVIDEND POLICY FROM TIME TO TIME, AND BASED UPON CURRENT PROJECTED EARNINGS AND CASH FLOW REQUIREMENTS, WE ANTICIPATE CONTINUING TO PAY A QUARTERLY

DIVIDEND IN THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE.

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS

IN CONNECTION WITH VARIOUS CONTRACTS AND AGREEMENTS, WE PROVIDE ROUTINE INDEMNIFICATIONS RELATING TO THE ENFORCEABILITY OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS,

COVERAGE FOR LEGAL ISSUES THAT ARISE AND OTHER ITEMS THAT FALL UNDER THE SCOPE OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD (FASB) INTERPRETATION NO. 45, GUARANTORS ACCOUNTING AND DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS FOR GUARANTEES,

INCLUDING INDIRECT GUARANTEES OF INDEBTEDNESS OF OTHERS. CURRENTLY, WE HAVE SEVERAL SUCH AGREEMENTS IN PLACE. HOWEVER, BASED ON OUR HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND THE ESTIMATED PROBABILITY OF FUTURE LOSS, WE HAVE DETERMINED THAT THE FAIR VALUE OF

SUCH INDEMNIFICATIONS IS NOT MATERIAL TO OUR FINANCIAL POSITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

CAPITAL RESOURCES

IN OCTOBER 2001, WE FILED A SHELF REGISTRATION STATEMENT WITH THE SEC UNDER WHICH $1 BILLION IN DEBT SECURITIES MAY BE ISSUED. IN MAY 2002, WE COMMENCED A MEDIUM-TERM NOTE PROGRAM UNDER THE SHELF REGISTRATION THAT

ALLOWS US TO ISSUE UP TO $500.0 MILLION IN MEDIUM-TERM NOTES AS OUR CAPITAL NEEDS DICTATE. WE ENTERED INTO THIS PROGRAM TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL LIQUIDITY TO MEET OUR WORKING CAPITAL AND GENERAL CORPORATE CASH REQUIREMENTS AND SINCE COMMENCEMENT OF THE

PROGRAM HAVE ISSUED $240.0 MILLION IN MEDIUM-TERM NOTES. AS OF MAY 31, 2008, $215.0 MILLION IN MEDIUM-TERM NOTES REMAINED OUTSTANDING. WE MAY ISSUE ADDITIONAL NOTES UNDER THE SHELF REGISTRATION IN FISCAL 2009 DEPENDING ON GENERAL CORPORATE

NEEDS.

DURING FISCAL 2008, ONE OF OUR JAPANESE SUBSIDIARIES ENTERED INTO A TOTAL OF ¥5.0 BILLION (APPROXIMATELY $47.4 MILLION AS OF

MAY 31, 2008) IN SHORT-TERM LOANS TO MEET GENERAL OPERATING NEEDS. THE INTEREST RATES ON THE LOANS ARE BASED ON THE PREVAILING TOKYO INTERBANK OFFER RATE OF OUR ELECTION PLUS A SPREAD, RESULTING IN A WEIGHTED AVERAGE ALL-IN RATE OF 1.06% AT

MAY 31, 2008.

DURING FISCAL 2007, ANOTHER OF OUR JAPANESE SUBSIDIARIES ENTERED INTO A ¥3.0 BILLION (APPROXIMATELY $28.5 MILLION

AS OF MAY 31, 2008) LOAN FACILITY THAT REPLACED CERTAIN INTERCOMPANY BORROWINGS. THE INTEREST RATE ON THE FACILITY IS BASED ON THE SIX-MONTH JAPANESE YEN LONDON INTERBANK OFFER RATE (JPY LIBOR) PLUS A SPREAD RESULTING IN AN ALL IN

RATE OF APPROXIMATELY 1.12% AT MAY 31, 2008. THIS LOAN FACILITY WAS RENEWED DURING FISCAL 2008. SUBSEQUENT TO MAY 31, 2008, THIS LOAN FACILITY EXPIRED AND WAS REPLACED WITH INTERCOMPANY BORROWINGS.

DURING FISCAL 2007, THE SAME JAPANESE SUBSIDIARY ENTERED INTO A ¥5.0 BILLION (APPROXIMATELY $47.4 MILLION AS OF MAY 31, 2008) TERM LOAN THAT

REPLACED CERTAIN INTERCOMPANY BORROWINGS AND MATURES ON FEBRUARY 14, 2012. THE INTEREST RATE ON THE LOAN IS APPROXIMATELY 1.5% AND INTEREST IS PAID SEMI-ANNUALLY.

AS OF MAY 31, 2008, WE HAD NO AMOUNTS OUTSTANDING UNDER OUR MULTI-YEAR, $1 BILLION REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY IN PLACE WITH A GROUP OF BANKS. THE FACILITY MATURES IN DECEMBER 2012 AND CAN BE EXTENDED FOR ONE

ADDITIONAL YEAR ON ITS NEXT ANNIVERSARY DATE. BASED ON OUR CURRENT LONG-TERM SENIOR UNSECURED DEBT RATINGS OF A+ AND A1 FROM STANDARD AND POORS CORPORATION AND MOODYS INVESTOR SERVICES, RESPECTIVELY, THE INTEREST RATE CHARGED ON ANY

OUTSTANDING BORROWINGS WOULD BE THE PREVAILING LONDON INTERBANK OFFER RATE (LIBOR) PLUS 0.15%. THE FACILITY FEE IS 0.05% OF THE TOTAL COMMITMENT.

IF OUR LONG-TERM DEBT RATING WERE TO DECLINE, THE FACILITY FEE AND INTEREST RATE UNDER OUR COMMITTED CREDIT FACILITY WOULD INCREASE. CONVERSELY, IF OUR LONG-TERM DEBT RATING WERE TO IMPROVE, THE FACILITY FEE AND

INTEREST RATE WOULD DECREASE. CHANGES IN OUR LONG-TERM DEBT RATING WOULD NOT TRIGGER ACCELERATION OF MATURITY OF ANY THEN OUTSTANDING BORROWINGS OR ANY FUTURE BORROWINGS UNDER THE COMMITTED CREDIT FACILITY. UNDER THIS COMMITTED CREDIT FACILITY, WE

HAVE AGREED TO VARIOUS COVENANTS. THESE COVENANTS INCLUDE LIMITS ON OUR DISPOSAL OF FIXED ASSETS AND THE AMOUNT OF DEBT SECURED BY LIENS WE MAY INCUR AS WELL AS A MINIMUM CAPITALIZATION RATIO. IN THE

36

TABLE OF CONTENTS

EVENT WE WERE TO HAVE ANY BORROWINGS OUTSTANDING UNDER THIS FACILITY, FAILED TO MEET ANY COVENANT, AND WERE UNABLE TO OBTAIN A WAIVER FROM A MAJORITY OF THE

BANKS, ANY BORROWINGS WOULD BECOME IMMEDIATELY DUE AND PAYABLE. AS OF MAY 31, 2008, WE WERE IN FULL COMPLIANCE WITH EACH OF THESE COVENANTS AND BELIEVE IT IS UNLIKELY WE WILL FAIL TO MEET ANY OF THESE COVENANTS IN THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE.

LIQUIDITY IS ALSO PROVIDED BY OUR COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAM, UNDER WHICH THERE WAS NO AMOUNT OUTSTANDING AT MAY 31, 2008 OR

MAY 31, 2007. WE CURRENTLY HAVE SHORT-TERM DEBT RATINGS OF A1 AND P1 FROM STANDARD AND POORS CORPORATION AND MOODYS INVESTOR SERVICES, RESPECTIVELY.

WE CURRENTLY BELIEVE THAT CASH GENERATED BY OPERATIONS, TOGETHER WITH ACCESS TO EXTERNAL SOURCES OF FUNDS AS DESCRIBED ABOVE, WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO MEET OUR OPERATING AND CAPITAL NEEDS IN THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE.

RECENTLY ADOPTED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

IN JUNE 2006, THE FASB ISSUED FIN 48, WHICH CLARIFIES THE ACCOUNTING FOR UNCERTAINTY IN INCOME TAXES RECOGNIZED IN OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH FASB STATEMENT NO. 109, ACCOUNTING FOR INCOME TAXES. WE ADOPTED

THE PROVISIONS OF FIN 48 ON JUNE 1, 2007. SEE NOTE 8 IN THE ACCOMPANYING NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION.

IN JUNE 2006, THE FASB RATIFIED THE CONSENSUS REACHED IN EMERGING ISSUES TASK FORCE (EITF) ISSUE NO. 06-2, ACCOUNTING FOR SABBATICAL LEAVE AND OTHER SIMILAR BENEFITS PURSUANT TO FASB STATEMENT NO. 43

(EITF 06-2). EITF 06-2 CLARIFIES RECOGNITION GUIDANCE ON THE ACCRUAL OF EMPLOYEES RIGHTS TO COMPENSATED ABSENCES UNDER A SABBATICAL OR OTHER SIMILAR BENEFIT ARRANGEMENT. THE ADOPTION OF EITF 06-2 ON JUNE 1, 2007 DID NOT HAVE A

MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL POSITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR CASH FLOWS.

RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

IN SEPTEMBER 2006, THE FASB ISSUED SFAS NO. 157, FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS (FAS 157). FAS 157 DEFINES FAIR VALUE, ESTABLISHES A

FRAMEWORK FOR MEASURING FAIR VALUE IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES, AND EXPANDS DISCLOSURES ABOUT FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS. THE PROVISIONS OF FAS 157 FOR FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE EFFECTIVE FOR OUR FISCAL YEAR

BEGINNING JUNE 1, 2008 AND THE PROVISIONS OF FAS 157 FOR NON-FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES EXCEPT FOR ITEMS RECOGNIZED AT FAIR VALUE ON A RECURRING BASIS ARE EFFECTIVE FOR THE FISCAL YEAR BEGINNING JUNE 1, 2009. WE ARE CURRENTLY

EVALUATING THE IMPACT OF THE PROVISIONS FOR NON-FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. WE HAVE EVALUATED THE PROVISIONS OF FAS 157 FOR FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AND DO NOT EXPECT THAT THE ADOPTION WILL HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL POSITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

IN FEBRUARY 2007, THE FASB ISSUED SFAS NO. 159, THE FAIR VALUE OPTION FOR

FINANCIAL ASSETS AND FINANCIAL LIABILITIES INCLUDING AN AMENDMENT OF FASB STATEMENT NO. 115 (FAS 159). FAS 159 PERMITS ENTITIES TO CHOOSE TO MEASURE MANY FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND CERTAIN OTHER ITEMS AT FAIR VALUE. THE

PROVISIONS OF FAS 159 ARE EFFECTIVE FOR THE FISCAL YEAR BEGINNING JUNE 1, 2008. WE HAVE EVALUATED THE PROVISIONS OF FAS 159 AND DO NOT EXPECT THAT THE ADOPTION WILL HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL POSITION OR RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS.

IN DECEMBER 2007, THE FASB ISSUED SFAS NO. 141 (REVISED 2007), BUSINESS COMBINATIONS (FAS 141(R))

AND SFAS NO. 160, NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS IN CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (FAS 160). THESE STANDARDS AIM TO IMPROVE, SIMPLIFY, AND CONVERGE INTERNATIONALLY THE ACCOUNTING FOR BUSINESS COMBINATIONS AND THE REPORTING

OF NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS IN CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. THE PROVISIONS OF FAS 141(R) AND FAS 160 ARE EFFECTIVE FOR THE FISCAL YEAR BEGINNING JUNE 1, 2009. WE ARE CURRENTLY EVALUATING THE IMPACT OF THE PROVISIONS OF FAS 141(R) AND FAS

160.

37

TABLE OF CONTENTS

IN MARCH 2008, THE FASB ISSUED SFAS NO. 161, DISCLOSURES ABOUT DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND

HEDGING ACTIVITIES (FAS 161). FAS 161 IS INTENDED TO IMPROVE FINANCIAL REPORTING ABOUT DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES BY REQUIRING ENHANCED DISCLOSURES TO ENABLE INVESTORS TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THEIR EFFECTS ON AN

ENTITYS FINANCIAL POSITION, FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE, AND CASH FLOWS. THE PROVISIONS OF FAS 161 ARE EFFECTIVE FOR THE QUARTER ENDING FEBRUARY 28, 2009. WE DO NOT EXPECT THAT THE ADOPTION OF FAS 161 WILL HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL POSITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

OUR PREVIOUS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS ARE BASED UPON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, WHICH HAVE

BEEN PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. THE PREPARATION OF THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS REQUIRES US TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS THAT AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS,

LIABILITIES, REVENUES AND EXPENSES, AND RELATED DISCLOSURE OF CONTINGENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES.

WE BELIEVE THAT THE ESTIMATES,

ASSUMPTIONS AND JUDGMENTS INVOLVED IN THE ACCOUNTING POLICIES DESCRIBED BELOW HAVE THE GREATEST POTENTIAL IMPACT ON OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, SO WE CONSIDER THESE TO BE OUR CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES. BECAUSE OF THE UNCERTAINTY INHERENT IN THESE

MATTERS, ACTUAL RESULTS COULD DIFFER FROM THE ESTIMATES WE USE IN APPLYING THE CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES. CERTAIN OF THESE CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AFFECT WORKING CAPITAL ACCOUNT BALANCES, INCLUDING THE POLICIES FOR REVENUE RECOGNITION, THE

ALLOWANCE FOR UNCOLLECTIBLE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, INVENTORY RESERVES, AND CONTINGENT PAYMENTS UNDER ENDORSEMENT CONTRACTS. THESE POLICIES REQUIRE THAT WE MAKE ESTIMATES IN THE PREPARATION OF OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AS OF A GIVEN DATE. HOWEVER, SINCE

OUR BUSINESS CYCLE IS RELATIVELY SHORT, ACTUAL RESULTS RELATED TO THESE ESTIMATES ARE GENERALLY KNOWN WITHIN THE SIX-MONTH PERIOD FOLLOWING THE FINANCIAL STATEMENT DATE. THUS, THESE POLICIES GENERALLY AFFECT ONLY THE TIMING OF REPORTED AMOUNTS

ACROSS TWO TO THREE FISCAL QUARTERS.

WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF THESE CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES, WE ARE NOT CURRENTLY AWARE OF ANY

REASONABLY LIKELY EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES THAT WOULD RESULT IN MATERIALLY DIFFERENT AMOUNTS BEING REPORTED.

REVENUE RECOGNITION

WE RECORD WHOLESALE REVENUES WHEN TITLE PASSES AND THE RISKS AND REWARDS OF OWNERSHIP HAVE PASSED TO THE CUSTOMER, BASED ON THE

TERMS OF SALE. TITLE PASSES GENERALLY UPON SHIPMENT OR UPON RECEIPT BY THE CUSTOMER DEPENDING ON THE COUNTRY OF THE SALE AND THE AGREEMENT WITH THE CUSTOMER. RETAIL STORE REVENUES ARE RECORDED AT THE TIME OF SALE.

IN SOME INSTANCES, WE SHIP PRODUCT DIRECTLY FROM OUR SUPPLIER TO THE CUSTOMER AND RECOGNIZE REVENUE WHEN THE PRODUCT IS DELIVERED TO AND ACCEPTED BY THE

CUSTOMER. OUR REVENUES MAY FLUCTUATE IN CASES WHEN OUR CUSTOMERS DELAY ACCEPTING SHIPMENT OF PRODUCT FOR PERIODS UP TO SEVERAL WEEKS.

IN

CERTAIN COUNTRIES OUTSIDE OF THE U.S., PRECISE INFORMATION REGARDING THE DATE OF RECEIPT BY THE CUSTOMER IS NOT READILY AVAILABLE. IN THESE CASES, WE ESTIMATE THE DATE OF RECEIPT BY THE CUSTOMER BASED UPON HISTORICAL DELIVERY TIMES BY GEOGRAPHIC

LOCATION. ON THE BASIS OF OUR TESTS OF ACTUAL TRANSACTIONS, WE HAVE NO INDICATION THAT THESE ESTIMATES HAVE BEEN MATERIALLY INACCURATE HISTORICALLY.

AS PART OF OUR REVENUE RECOGNITION POLICY, WE RECORD ESTIMATED SALES RETURNS AND MISCELLANEOUS CLAIMS FROM CUSTOMERS AS REDUCTIONS TO REVENUES AT THE TIME REVENUES ARE RECORDED. WE BASE OUR ESTIMATES ON HISTORICAL

RATES OF PRODUCT RETURNS AND CLAIMS, AND SPECIFIC IDENTIFICATION OF OUTSTANDING CLAIMS AND OUTSTANDING RETURNS NOT YET RECEIVED FROM CUSTOMERS. ACTUAL RETURNS AND CLAIMS IN ANY FUTURE PERIOD ARE INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN AND THUS MAY DIFFER FROM OUR

ESTIMATES. IF ACTUAL OR EXPECTED FUTURE RETURNS AND CLAIMS WERE SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER OR LOWER THAN THE RESERVES WE HAD ESTABLISHED, WE WOULD RECORD A REDUCTION OR INCREASE TO NET REVENUES IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH WE MADE SUCH DETERMINATION.

38

TABLE OF CONTENTS

ALLOWANCE FOR UNCOLLECTIBLE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE

WE MAKE ONGOING ESTIMATES RELATING TO THE ABILITY TO COLLECT OUR ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND MAINTAIN AN ALLOWANCE FOR ESTIMATED LOSSES RESULTING FROM THE

INABILITY OF OUR CUSTOMERS TO MAKE REQUIRED PAYMENTS. IN DETERMINING THE AMOUNT OF THE ALLOWANCE, WE CONSIDER OUR HISTORICAL LEVEL OF CREDIT LOSSES AND MAKE JUDGMENTS ABOUT THE CREDITWORTHINESS OF SIGNIFICANT CUSTOMERS BASED ON ONGOING CREDIT

EVALUATIONS. SINCE WE CANNOT PREDICT FUTURE CHANGES IN THE FINANCIAL STABILITY OF OUR CUSTOMERS, ACTUAL FUTURE LOSSES FROM UNCOLLECTIBLE ACCOUNTS MAY DIFFER FROM OUR ESTIMATES. IF THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF OUR CUSTOMERS WERE TO DETERIORATE,

RESULTING IN THEIR INABILITY TO MAKE PAYMENTS, A LARGER ALLOWANCE MIGHT BE REQUIRED. IN THE EVENT WE DETERMINE THAT A SMALLER OR LARGER ALLOWANCE IS APPROPRIATE, WE WOULD RECORD A CREDIT OR A CHARGE TO SELLING AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE IN THE

PERIOD IN WHICH SUCH A DETERMINATION IS MADE.

INVENTORY RESERVES

WE ALSO MAKE ONGOING ESTIMATES RELATING TO THE NET REALIZABLE VALUE OF INVENTORIES, BASED UPON OUR ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT FUTURE DEMAND AND MARKET CONDITIONS.

IF WE ESTIMATE THAT THE NET REALIZABLE VALUE OF OUR INVENTORY IS LESS THAN THE COST OF THE INVENTORY RECORDED ON OUR BOOKS, WE RECORD A RESERVE EQUAL TO THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE COST OF THE INVENTORY AND THE ESTIMATED NET REALIZABLE VALUE. THIS

RESERVE IS RECORDED AS A CHARGE TO COST OF SALES. IF CHANGES IN MARKET CONDITIONS RESULT IN REDUCTIONS IN THE ESTIMATED NET REALIZABLE VALUE OF OUR INVENTORY BELOW OUR PREVIOUS ESTIMATE, WE WOULD INCREASE OUR RESERVE IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH WE MADE

SUCH A DETERMINATION AND RECORD A CHARGE TO COST OF SALES.

CONTINGENT PAYMENTS UNDER ENDORSEMENT CONTRACTS

A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR DEMAND CREATION EXPENSE RELATES TO PAYMENTS UNDER ENDORSEMENT CONTRACTS. IN GENERAL, ENDORSEMENT PAYMENTS ARE EXPENSED

UNIFORMLY OVER THE TERM OF THE CONTRACT. HOWEVER, CERTAIN CONTRACT ELEMENTS MAY BE ACCOUNTED FOR DIFFERENTLY, BASED UPON THE FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES OF EACH INDIVIDUAL CONTRACT.

SOME OF THE CONTRACTS PROVIDE FOR CONTINGENT PAYMENTS TO ENDORSERS BASED UPON SPECIFIC ACHIEVEMENTS IN THEIR SPORTS (E.G., WINNING A CHAMPIONSHIP). WE

RECORD SELLING AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE FOR THESE AMOUNTS WHEN THE ENDORSER ACHIEVES THE SPECIFIC GOAL.

SOME OF THE CONTRACTS PROVIDE

FOR PAYMENTS BASED UPON ENDORSERS MAINTAINING A LEVEL OF PERFORMANCE IN THEIR SPORT OVER AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF TIME (E.G., MAINTAINING A TOP RANKING IN A SPORT FOR A YEAR). THESE AMOUNTS ARE REPORTED IN SELLING AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE WHEN WE

DETERMINE THAT IT IS PROBABLE THAT THE SPECIFIED LEVEL OF PERFORMANCE WILL BE MAINTAINED THROUGHOUT THE PERIOD. IN THESE INSTANCES, TO THE EXTENT THAT ACTUAL PAYMENTS TO THE ENDORSER DIFFER FROM OUR ESTIMATE DUE TO CHANGES IN THE ENDORSERS

ATHLETIC PERFORMANCE, INCREASED OR DECREASED SELLING AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE MAY BE REPORTED IN A FUTURE PERIOD.

SOME OF THE CONTRACTS

PROVIDE FOR ROYALTY PAYMENTS TO ENDORSERS BASED UPON A PREDETERMINED PERCENTAGE OF SALES OF PARTICULAR PRODUCTS. WE EXPENSE THESE PAYMENTS IN COST OF SALES AS THE RELATED SALES OCCUR. IN CERTAIN CONTRACTS, WE OFFER MINIMUM GUARANTEED ROYALTY

PAYMENTS. FOR CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS FOR WHICH WE ESTIMATE THAT WE WILL NOT MEET THE MINIMUM GUARANTEED AMOUNT OF ROYALTY FEES THROUGH SALES OF PRODUCT, WE RECORD THE AMOUNT OF THE GUARANTEED PAYMENT IN EXCESS OF THAT EARNED THROUGH SALES OF

PRODUCT IN SELLING AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE UNIFORMLY OVER THE REMAINING GUARANTEE PERIOD.

PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT

PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT, INCLUDING BUILDINGS, EQUIPMENT, AND COMPUTER HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE IS RECORDED AT COST (INCLUDING, IN SOME

CASES, THE COST OF INTERNAL LABOR) AND IS DEPRECIATED OVER ITS ESTIMATED USEFUL LIFE. CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES (SUCH AS TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES OR CHANGES TO OUR BUSINESS OPERATIONS) CAN RESULT

39

TABLE OF CONTENTS

IN DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE ACTUAL AND ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES. IN THOSE CASES WHERE WE DETERMINE THAT THE USEFUL LIFE OF A LONG-LIVED ASSET SHOULD BE

SHORTENED, WE INCREASE DEPRECIATION EXPENSE OVER THE REMAINING USEFUL LIFE TO DEPRECIATE THE ASSETS NET BOOK VALUE TO ITS SALVAGE VALUE.

WHEN EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THAT THE CARRYING VALUE OF PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT MAY BE IMPAIRED, WE ESTIMATE THE FUTURE UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS TO BE DERIVED FROM THE ASSET TO DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT A POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT

EXISTS. IF THE CARRYING VALUE EXCEEDS OUR ESTIMATE OF FUTURE UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS, WE THEN CALCULATE THE IMPAIRMENT AS THE EXCESS OF THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE ASSET OVER OUR ESTIMATE OF ITS FAIR MARKET VALUE. ANY IMPAIRMENT CHARGES ARE RECORDED

WITHIN OTHER (EXPENSE) INCOME, NET. WE ESTIMATE FUTURE UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS USING ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT OUR EXPECTED FUTURE OPERATING PERFORMANCE. OUR ESTIMATES OF UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS MAY CHANGE IN FUTURE PERIODS DUE TO, AMONG OTHER THINGS,

TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGES, ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, AND CHANGES TO OUR BUSINESS OPERATIONS OR INABILITY TO MEET BUSINESS PLANS. SUCH CHANGES MAY RESULT IN IMPAIRMENT CHARGES IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH SUCH CHANGES IN ESTIMATES ARE MADE.

GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS

IN ACCORDANCE WITH SFAS NO. 142, GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS (FAS 142), GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS WITH INDEFINITE LIVES ARE NOT AMORTIZED BUT INSTEAD MEASURED FOR IMPAIRMENT AT LEAST ANNUALLY IN

THE FOURTH FISCAL QUARTER, OR WHEN EVENTS INDICATE THAT AN IMPAIRMENT EXISTS. AS REQUIRED BY FAS 142, IN OUR IMPAIRMENT TESTS FOR GOODWILL AND OTHER INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS, WE COMPARE THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF GOODWILL AND OTHER

INTANGIBLE ASSETS TO THE CARRYING VALUE. IF THE CARRYING VALUE EXCEEDS OUR ESTIMATE OF FAIR VALUE, WE CALCULATE IMPAIRMENT AS THE EXCESS OF THE CARRYING VALUE OVER OUR ESTIMATE OF FAIR VALUE. OUR ESTIMATES OF FAIR VALUE UTILIZED IN GOODWILL AND

OTHER INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSET TESTS REQUIRE THE USE OF DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW VALUATION MODELS. THOSE MODELS REQUIRE ESTIMATES OF FUTURE REVENUE, PROFITS, EXPENDITURES AND WORKING CAPITAL. THESE ESTIMATES ARE DETERMINED BY EVALUATING

HISTORICAL TRENDS, CURRENT BUDGETS, OPERATING PLANS AND INDUSTRY DATA. OUR ESTIMATES MAY CHANGE IN FUTURE PERIODS DUE TO, AMONG OTHER THINGS, TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE, ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, CHANGES TO OUR BUSINESS OPERATIONS OR INABILITY TO MEET BUSINESS

PLANS. SUCH CHANGES MAY RESULT IN IMPAIRMENT CHARGES RECORDED IN FUTURE PERIODS. ANY IMPAIRMENT CHARGE RELATED TO GOODWILL WOULD BE CLASSIFIED AS A SEPARATE LINE ITEM ON OUR CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF INCOME AS PART OF INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES AND

ANY IMPAIRMENT CHARGE RELATED TO OTHER INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS WOULD BE CLASSIFIED WITHIN OTHER (EXPENSE) INCOME, NET.

INTANGIBLE ASSETS THAT ARE DETERMINED TO HAVE DEFINITE LIVES ARE AMORTIZED OVER THEIR USEFUL LIVES AND ARE MEASURED FOR IMPAIRMENT ONLY WHEN EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THE CARRYING VALUE MAY BE IMPAIRED. IN THESE CASES, WE ESTIMATE

THE FUTURE UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS TO BE DERIVED FROM THE ASSET TO DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT A POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT EXISTS. IF THE CARRYING VALUE EXCEEDS OUR ESTIMATE OF FUTURE UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS, WE THEN CALCULATE THE IMPAIRMENT AS THE EXCESS

OF THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE ASSET OVER OUR ESTIMATE OF ITS FAIR VALUE. ANY SIGNIFICANT IMPAIRMENT CHARGES WOULD BE CLASSIFIED WITHIN OTHER (EXPENSE) INCOME, NET.

HEDGE ACCOUNTING FOR DERIVATIVES

WE USE FORWARD EXCHANGE CONTRACTS AND OPTION CONTRACTS TO

HEDGE CERTAIN ANTICIPATED FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE TRANSACTIONS, AS WELL AS ANY RESULTING RECEIVABLE OR PAYABLE BALANCE. WHEN SPECIFIC CRITERIA REQUIRED BY SFAS NO. 133, ACCOUNTING FOR DERIVATIVE AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES, AS AMENDED

AND INTERPRETED (FAS 133), HAVE BEEN MET, CHANGES IN FAIR VALUES OF HEDGE CONTRACTS RELATING TO ANTICIPATED TRANSACTIONS ARE RECORDED IN OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME RATHER THAN NET INCOME UNTIL THE UNDERLYING HEDGED TRANSACTION AFFECTS

NET INCOME. IN MOST CASES, THIS RESULTS IN GAINS AND LOSSES ON HEDGE DERIVATIVES BEING RELEASED FROM OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME INTO NET INCOME SOME TIME AFTER THE MATURITY OF THE DERIVATIVE. ONE OF THE CRITERIA FOR THIS ACCOUNTING TREATMENT IS THAT

THE FORWARD EXCHANGE CONTRACT AMOUNT SHOULD NOT BE IN EXCESS OF SPECIFICALLY IDENTIFIED ANTICIPATED TRANSACTIONS. BY THEIR VERY NATURE, OUR ESTIMATES OF ANTICIPATED TRANSACTIONS MAY FLUCTUATE OVER TIME AND MAY ULTIMATELY VARY FROM ACTUAL

TRANSACTIONS. WHEN ANTICIPATED TRANSACTION ESTIMATES OR ACTUAL TRANSACTION AMOUNTS DECREASE BELOW HEDGED LEVELS, OR WHEN THE TIMING OF TRANSACTIONS CHANGES BEYOND THE THRESHOLD ALLOWED BY FAS 133, WE ARE

40

TABLE OF CONTENTS

REQUIRED TO RECLASSIFY AT LEAST A PORTION OF THE CUMULATIVE CHANGES IN FAIR VALUES OF THE RELATED HEDGE CONTRACTS FROM OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME TO OTHER

(EXPENSE) INCOME, NET DURING THE QUARTER IN WHICH SUCH CHANGES OCCUR. ONCE AN ANTICIPATED TRANSACTION ESTIMATE OR ACTUAL TRANSACTION AMOUNT DECREASES BELOW HEDGED LEVELS, WE MAKE ADJUSTMENTS TO THE RELATED HEDGE CONTRACT IN ORDER TO REDUCE THE

AMOUNT OF THE HEDGE CONTRACT TO THAT OF THE REVISED ANTICIPATED TRANSACTION.

WE USE FORWARD CONTRACTS TO HEDGE OUR INVESTMENT IN THE NET

ASSETS OF CERTAIN INTERNATIONAL SUBSIDIARIES TO OFFSET FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION AND ECONOMIC EXPOSURES RELATED TO OUR NET INVESTMENT IN THOSE SUBSIDIARIES. WHEN APPROPRIATELY DESIGNATED AS A HEDGE IN ACCORDANCE WITH FAS 133, THE CHANGE IN FAIR

VALUE OF THE FORWARD CONTRACTS HEDGING OUR NET INVESTMENTS IS REPORTED IN THE CUMULATIVE TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENT COMPONENT OF ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME WITHIN STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY TO OFFSET THE FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION

ADJUSTMENTS ON THOSE INVESTMENTS.

AS THE VALUE OF OUR UNDERLYING NET INVESTMENTS IN WHOLLY-OWNED INTERNATIONAL SUBSIDIARIES IS KNOWN AT

THE TIME A HEDGE IS PLACED, THE DESIGNATED HEDGE IS MATCHED TO THE PORTION OF OUR NET INVESTMENT AT RISK. ACCORDINGLY, THE VARIABILITY INVOLVED IN NET INVESTMENT HEDGES IS SUBSTANTIALLY LESS THAN THAT OF OTHER TYPES OF HEDGE TRANSACTIONS AND WE DO

NOT EXPECT ANY MATERIAL INEFFECTIVENESS. IN ACCORDANCE WITH FAS 133, WE CONSIDER, ON A QUARTERLY BASIS, THE NEED TO REDESIGNATE EXISTING HEDGE RELATIONSHIPS BASED ON CHANGES IN THE UNDERLYING NET INVESTMENT. SHOULD THE LEVEL OF OUR NET INVESTMENT

DECREASE BELOW HEDGED LEVELS, ANY RESULTING INEFFECTIVENESS WOULD BE REPORTED DIRECTLY TO EARNINGS IN THE PERIOD INCURRED.

STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION

AS OF THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2007, WE ACCOUNT FOR STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION IN

ACCORDANCE WITH FAS 123R. UNDER THE PROVISIONS OF FAS 123R, THE FAIR VALUE OF STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION IS ESTIMATED ON THE DATE OF GRANT USING THE BLACK-SCHOLES OPTION PRICING MODEL. THE BLACK-SCHOLES OPTION PRICING MODEL REQUIRES THE INPUT OF

HIGHLY SUBJECTIVE ASSUMPTIONS INCLUDING VOLATILITY. EXPECTED VOLATILITY IS ESTIMATED BASED ON IMPLIED VOLATILITY IN MARKET TRADED OPTIONS ON OUR COMMON STOCK WITH A TERM GREATER THAN ONE YEAR, ALONG WITH OTHER FACTORS. OUR DECISION TO USE IMPLIED

VOLATILITY WAS BASED ON THE AVAILABILITY OF ACTIVELY TRADED OPTIONS ON OUR COMMON STOCK AND OUR ASSESSMENT THAT IMPLIED VOLATILITY IS MORE REPRESENTATIVE OF FUTURE STOCK PRICE TRENDS THAN HISTORICAL VOLATILITY. IF FACTORS CHANGE AND WE USE DIFFERENT

ASSUMPTIONS FOR ESTIMATING STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE IN FUTURE PERIODS, STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE MAY DIFFER MATERIALLY IN THE FUTURE FROM THAT RECORDED IN THE CURRENT PERIOD.

TAXES

WE RECORD VALUATION

ALLOWANCES AGAINST OUR DEFERRED TAX ASSETS, WHEN NECESSARY, IN ACCORDANCE WITH SFAS NO. 109, ACCOUNTING FOR INCOME TAXES. REALIZATION OF DEFERRED TAX ASSETS (SUCH AS NET OPERATING LOSS CARRY-FORWARDS) IS DEPENDENT ON FUTURE

TAXABLE EARNINGS AND IS THEREFORE UNCERTAIN. AT LEAST QUARTERLY, WE ASSESS THE LIKELIHOOD THAT OUR DEFERRED TAX ASSET BALANCE WILL BE RECOVERED FROM FUTURE TAXABLE INCOME. TO THE EXTENT WE BELIEVE THAT RECOVERY IS NOT LIKELY, WE ESTABLISH A

VALUATION ALLOWANCE AGAINST OUR DEFERRED TAX ASSET, INCREASING OUR INCOME TAX EXPENSE IN THE PERIOD SUCH DETERMINATION IS MADE.

IN

ADDITION, WE HAVE NOT RECORDED U.S. INCOME TAX EXPENSE FOR FOREIGN EARNINGS THAT WE HAVE DETERMINED TO BE INDEFINITELY REINVESTED OFFSHORE, THUS REDUCING OUR OVERALL INCOME TAX EXPENSE. THE AMOUNT OF EARNINGS DESIGNATED AS INDEFINITELY REINVESTED

OFFSHORE IS BASED UPON THE ACTUAL DEPLOYMENT OF SUCH EARNINGS IN OUR OFFSHORE ASSETS AND OUR EXPECTATIONS OF THE FUTURE CASH NEEDS OF OUR U.S. AND FOREIGN ENTITIES. INCOME TAX CONSIDERATIONS ARE ALSO A FACTOR IN DETERMINING THE AMOUNT OF FOREIGN

EARNINGS TO BE INDEFINITELY REINVESTED OFFSHORE.

WE CAREFULLY REVIEW ALL FACTORS THAT DRIVE THE ULTIMATE DISPOSITION OF FOREIGN EARNINGS

DETERMINED TO BE REINVESTED OFFSHORE, AND APPLY STRINGENT STANDARDS TO OVERCOMING THE PRESUMPTION OF REPATRIATION. DESPITE THIS APPROACH, BECAUSE THE DETERMINATION INVOLVES OUR FUTURE PLANS AND EXPECTATIONS OF FUTURE EVENTS, THE POSSIBILITY EXISTS

41

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THAT AMOUNTS DECLARED AS INDEFINITELY REINVESTED OFFSHORE MAY ULTIMATELY BE REPATRIATED. FOR INSTANCE, THE ACTUAL CASH NEEDS OF OUR U.S. ENTITIES MAY EXCEED

OUR CURRENT EXPECTATIONS, OR THE ACTUAL CASH NEEDS OF OUR FOREIGN ENTITIES MAY BE LESS THAN OUR CURRENT EXPECTATIONS. THIS WOULD RESULT IN ADDITIONAL INCOME TAX EXPENSE IN THE YEAR WE DETERMINED THAT AMOUNTS WERE NO LONGER INDEFINITELY REINVESTED

OFFSHORE. CONVERSELY, OUR APPROACH MAY ALSO RESULT IN A DETERMINATION THAT ACCUMULATED FOREIGN EARNINGS (FOR WHICH U.S. INCOME TAXES HAVE BEEN PROVIDED) WILL BE INDEFINITELY REINVESTED OFFSHORE. IN THIS CASE, OUR INCOME TAX EXPENSE WOULD BE REDUCED

IN THE YEAR OF SUCH DETERMINATION.

ON AN INTERIM BASIS, WE ESTIMATE WHAT OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE WILL BE FOR THE FULL FISCAL YEAR. THE

ESTIMATED ANNUAL EFFECTIVE TAX RATE IS THEN APPLIED TO THE YEAR-TO-DATE PRE-TAX INCOME EXCLUDING INFREQUENTLY OCCURRING OR UNUSUAL ITEMS, TO DETERMINE THE YEAR-TO-DATE TAX EXPENSE. THE INCOME TAX EFFECTS OF INFREQUENT OR UNUSUAL ITEMS ARE RECOGNIZED

IN THE INTERIM PERIOD IN WHICH THEY OCCUR. AS THE FISCAL YEAR PROGRESSES, WE CONTINUALLY REFINE OUR ESTIMATE BASED UPON ACTUAL EVENTS AND EARNINGS BY JURISDICTION DURING THE YEAR. THIS CONTINUAL ESTIMATION PROCESS PERIODICALLY RESULTS IN A CHANGE TO

OUR EXPECTED EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR THE FISCAL YEAR. WHEN THIS OCCURS, WE ADJUST THE INCOME TAX PROVISION DURING THE QUARTER IN WHICH THE CHANGE IN ESTIMATE OCCURS SO THAT THE YEAR-TO-DATE PROVISION EQUALS THE EXPECTED ANNUAL RATE.

WE ACCOUNT FOR UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS IN ACCORDANCE WITH FIN 48. ON A QUARTERLY BASIS, WE REEVALUATE THE PROBABILITY THAT A TAX POSITION WILL BE

EFFECTIVELY SUSTAINED AND THE APPROPRIATENESS OF THE AMOUNT RECOGNIZED FOR UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS BASED ON FACTORS INCLUDING CHANGES IN FACTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES, CHANGES IN TAX LAW, SETTLED AUDIT ISSUES AND NEW AUDIT ACTIVITY. CHANGES IN OUR

ASSESSMENT MAY RESULT IN THE RECOGNITION OF A TAX BENEFIT OR AN ADDITIONAL CHARGE TO THE TAX PROVISION IN THE PERIOD OUR ASSESSMENT CHANGES. WE RECOGNIZE INTEREST AND PENALTIES RELATED TO INCOME TAX MATTERS IN INCOME TAX EXPENSE.

OTHER CONTINGENCIES

IN THE

ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS, WE ARE INVOLVED IN LEGAL PROCEEDINGS REGARDING CONTRACTUAL AND EMPLOYMENT RELATIONSHIPS, PRODUCT LIABILITY CLAIMS, TRADEMARK RIGHTS, AND A VARIETY OF OTHER MATTERS. WE RECORD CONTINGENT LIABILITIES RESULTING FROM CLAIMS

AGAINST US, INCLUDING RELATED LEGAL COSTS, WHEN A LOSS IS ASSESSED TO BE PROBABLE AND THE AMOUNT OF THE LOSS IS REASONABLY ESTIMABLE. ASSESSING PROBABILITY OF LOSS AND ESTIMATING PROBABLE LOSSES REQUIRES ANALYSIS OF MULTIPLE FACTORS, INCLUDING IN

SOME CASES JUDGMENTS ABOUT THE POTENTIAL ACTIONS OF THIRD PARTY CLAIMANTS AND COURTS. RECORDED CONTINGENT LIABILITIES ARE BASED ON THE BEST INFORMATION AVAILABLE AND ACTUAL LOSSES IN ANY FUTURE PERIOD ARE INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN. IF FUTURE ADJUSTMENTS

TO ESTIMATED PROBABLE FUTURE LOSSES OR ACTUAL LOSSES EXCEED OUR RECORDED LIABILITY FOR SUCH CLAIMS, WE WOULD RECORD ADDITIONAL CHARGES AS OTHER (EXPENSE) INCOME, NET DURING THE PERIOD IN WHICH THE ACTUAL LOSS OR CHANGE IN ESTIMATE OCCURRED. IN

ADDITION TO CONTINGENT LIABILITIES RECORDED FOR PROBABLE LOSSES, WE DISCLOSE CONTINGENT LIABILITIES WHEN THERE IS A REASONABLE POSSIBILITY THAT THE ULTIMATE LOSS WILL MATERIALLY EXCEED THE RECORDED LIABILITY. CURRENTLY, WE DO NOT BELIEVE THAT ANY OF

OUR PENDING LEGAL PROCEEDINGS OR CLAIMS WILL HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR FINANCIAL POSITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

ITEM 7A.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS AND CONSISTENT WITH ESTABLISHED POLICIES AND PROCEDURES, WE EMPLOY A VARIETY OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS TO MANAGE EXPOSURE TO FLUCTUATIONS IN THE VALUE OF FOREIGN CURRENCIES AND INTEREST

RATES. IT IS OUR POLICY TO UTILIZE THESE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS ONLY WHERE NECESSARY TO FINANCE OUR BUSINESS AND MANAGE SUCH EXPOSURES; WE DO NOT ENTER INTO THESE TRANSACTIONS FOR SPECULATIVE PURPOSES.

WE ARE EXPOSED TO FOREIGN CURRENCY FLUCTUATION AS A RESULT OF OUR INTERNATIONAL SALES, PRODUCT SOURCING AND FUNDING ACTIVITIES. OUR FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK

MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVE IS TO REDUCE THE VARIABILITY OF LOCAL ENTITY CASH FLOWS AS A RESULT OF EXCHANGE RATE MOVEMENTS. WE USE FORWARD EXCHANGE CONTRACTS AND OPTIONS TO HEDGE CERTAIN ANTICIPATED BUT NOT YET FIRMLY COMMITTED TRANSACTIONS AS WELL AS

CERTAIN FIRM COMMITMENTS AND THE RELATED RECEIVABLES AND PAYABLES, INCLUDING THIRD PARTY AND INTERCOMPANY TRANSACTIONS. WE ALSO USE FORWARD CONTRACTS TO HEDGE OUR INVESTMENT IN THE NET ASSETS OF CERTAIN INTERNATIONAL SUBSIDIARIES TO OFFSET FOREIGN

CURRENCY TRANSLATION AND ECONOMIC EXPOSURES RELATED TO OUR NET INVESTMENT IN THOSE SUBSIDIARIES.

42

TABLE OF CONTENTS

WHEN WE BEGIN HEDGING EXPOSURES, THE TYPE AND DURATION OF EACH HEDGE DEPENDS ON THE NATURE OF THE

EXPOSURE AND MARKET CONDITIONS. GENERALLY, ALL ANTICIPATED AND FIRMLY COMMITTED TRANSACTIONS THAT ARE HEDGED ARE TO BE RECOGNIZED WITHIN TWELVE TO EIGHTEEN MONTHS, ALTHOUGH AT MAY 31, 2008 WE HAD FORWARD CONTRACTS HEDGING ANTICIPATED

TRANSACTIONS THAT WILL BE RECOGNIZED IN AS MANY AS 34 MONTHS. THE MAJORITY OF THE CONTRACTS EXPIRING IN MORE THAN TWELVE MONTHS RELATE TO THE ANTICIPATED PURCHASE OF INVENTORY BY ONE OF OUR EUROPEAN SUBSIDIARIES. WHEN INTERCOMPANY LOANS ARE HEDGED,

IT IS TYPICALLY FOR THEIR EXPECTED DURATION. HEDGED TRANSACTIONS ARE PRINCIPALLY DENOMINATED IN EUROS, BRITISH POUNDS, AND JAPANESE YEN.

OUR EARNINGS ARE ALSO EXPOSED TO MOVEMENTS IN SHORT AND LONG-TERM MARKET INTEREST RATES. OUR OBJECTIVE IN MANAGING THIS INTEREST RATE EXPOSURE IS TO LIMIT THE IMPACT OF INTEREST RATE CHANGES ON EARNINGS AND CASH FLOWS AND TO REDUCE OVERALL

BORROWING COSTS. TO ACHIEVE THESE OBJECTIVES, WE MAINTAIN A MIX OF COMMERCIAL PAPER, BANK LOANS AND FIXED RATE DEBT OF VARYING MATURITIES AND HAVE ENTERED INTO RECEIVE-FIXED, PAY-VARIABLE INTEREST RATE SWAPS.

MARKET RISK MEASUREMENT

WE MONITOR FOREIGN EXCHANGE

RISK, INTEREST RATE RISK AND RELATED DERIVATIVES USING A VARIETY OF TECHNIQUES INCLUDING A REVIEW OF MARKET VALUE, SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS, AND VALUE-AT-RISK (VAR). OUR MARKET-SENSITIVE DERIVATIVE AND OTHER FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, AS DEFINED

BY THE SEC, ARE FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS, FOREIGN CURRENCY OPTION CONTRACTS, INTEREST RATE SWAPS, INTERCOMPANY LOANS DENOMINATED IN NON-FUNCTIONAL CURRENCIES, FIXED INTEREST RATE U.S. DOLLAR DENOMINATED DEBT, AND FIXED INTEREST RATE

JAPANESE YEN DENOMINATED DEBT.

WE USE VAR TO MONITOR THE FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK OF OUR FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD AND FOREIGN CURRENCY OPTION

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS ONLY. THE VAR DETERMINES THE MAXIMUM POTENTIAL ONE-DAY LOSS IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THESE FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATE-SENSITIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS. THE VAR MODEL ESTIMATES ASSUME NORMAL MARKET CONDITIONS AND A 95% CONFIDENCE LEVEL.

THERE ARE VARIOUS MODELING TECHNIQUES THAT CAN BE USED IN THE VAR COMPUTATION. OUR COMPUTATIONS ARE BASED ON INTERRELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN CURRENCIES AND INTEREST RATES (A VARIANCE/CO-VARIANCE TECHNIQUE). THESE INTERRELATIONSHIPS ARE A

FUNCTION OF FOREIGN EXCHANGE CURRENCY MARKET CHANGES AND INTEREST RATE CHANGES OVER THE PRECEDING ONE YEAR PERIOD. THE VALUE OF FOREIGN CURRENCY OPTIONS DOES NOT CHANGE ON A ONE-TO-ONE BASIS WITH CHANGES IN THE UNDERLYING CURRENCY RATE. WE ADJUSTED

THE POTENTIAL LOSS IN OPTION VALUE FOR THE ESTIMATED SENSITIVITY (THE DELTA AND GAMMA) TO CHANGES IN THE UNDERLYING CURRENCY RATE. THIS CALCULATION REFLECTS THE IMPACT OF FOREIGN CURRENCY RATE FLUCTUATIONS ON THE DERIVATIVE

INSTRUMENTS ONLY, AND DOES NOT INCLUDE THE IMPACT OF SUCH RATE FLUCTUATIONS ON NON-FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY TRANSACTIONS (SUCH AS ANTICIPATED TRANSACTIONS, FIRM COMMITMENTS, CASH BALANCES, AND ACCOUNTS AND LOANS RECEIVABLE AND PAYABLE), INCLUDING THOSE

WHICH ARE HEDGED BY THESE INSTRUMENTS.

THE VAR MODEL IS A RISK ANALYSIS TOOL AND DOES NOT PURPORT TO REPRESENT ACTUAL LOSSES IN FAIR VALUE

THAT WE WILL INCUR, NOR DOES IT CONSIDER THE POTENTIAL EFFECT OF FAVORABLE CHANGES IN MARKET RATES. IT ALSO DOES NOT REPRESENT THE FULL EXTENT OF THE POSSIBLE LOSS THAT MAY OCCUR. ACTUAL FUTURE GAINS AND LOSSES WILL DIFFER FROM THOSE ESTIMATED

BECAUSE OF CHANGES OR DIFFERENCES IN MARKET RATES AND INTERRELATIONSHIPS, HEDGING INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGE PERCENTAGES, TIMING AND OTHER FACTORS.

THE ESTIMATED MAXIMUM ONE-DAY LOSS IN FAIR VALUE ON OUR FOREIGN CURRENCY SENSITIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, DERIVED USING THE VAR MODEL, WAS $34.9 MILLION AND $13.7 MILLION AT MAY 31, 2008 AND MAY 31, 2007, RESPECTIVELY. THE

INCREASE IN VAR AS OF MAY 31, 2008 OCCURRED DUE TO A HIGHER NOTIONAL VALUE OF OUTSTANDING FOREIGN CURRENCY DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS COUPLED WITH INCREASED FOREIGN CURRENCY VOLATILITY AS OF MAY 31, 2008 COMPARED TO MAY 31, 2007. SUCH A

HYPOTHETICAL LOSS IN FAIR VALUE OF OUR DERIVATIVES WOULD BE OFFSET BY INCREASES IN THE VALUE OF THE UNDERLYING TRANSACTIONS BEING HEDGED. THE AVERAGE MONTHLY CHANGE IN THE FAIR VALUES OF FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD AND FOREIGN CURRENCY OPTION

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS WAS $32.3 MILLION AND $36.5 MILLION DURING FISCAL 2008 AND FISCAL 2007, RESPECTIVELY.

INTERCOMPANY LOANS AND RELATED INTEREST AMOUNTS ELIMINATE IN CONSOLIDATION. INTERCOMPANY LOANS ARE

GENERALLY HEDGED AGAINST FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK THROUGH THE USE OF FORWARD CONTRACTS WITH THIRD PARTIES, AS DISCUSSED ABOVE.

THE FIXED

INTEREST RATE JAPANESE YEN DENOMINATED DEBTS WERE ISSUED BY AND ARE ACCOUNTED FOR BY ONE OF OUR JAPANESE SUBSIDIARIES. ACCORDINGLY, THE MONTHLY RE-MEASUREMENT OF THESE INSTRUMENTS DUE TO CHANGES IN FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES IS RECOGNIZED IN ACCUMULATED

OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME UPON THE CONSOLIDATION OF THIS SUBSIDIARY.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

IN FISCAL 2003 WE ALSO ENTERED INTO AN INTEREST RATE SWAP AGREEMENT RELATED TO A JAPANESE YEN DENOMINATED

INTERCOMPANY LOAN WITH ONE OF OUR JAPANESE SUBSIDIARIES. THE JAPANESE SUBSIDIARY PAYS VARIABLE INTEREST ON THE INTERCOMPANY LOAN BASED ON 3-MONTH LIBOR PLUS A SPREAD. UNDER THE INTEREST RATE SWAP AGREEMENT, THE SUBSIDIARY PAYS FIXED INTEREST

PAYMENTS AT 0.80% AND RECEIVES VARIABLE INTEREST PAYMENTS BASED ON 3-MONTH LIBOR PLUS A SPREAD BASED ON A NOTIONAL AMOUNT OF 8.0 BILLION JAPANESE YEN. THIS INTEREST RATE SWAP IS NOT ACCOUNTED FOR AS A HEDGE. ACCORDINGLY, CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF

THE SWAP ARE RECORDED TO NET INCOME EACH PERIOD. THE CHANGE IN FAIR VALUE OF THE SWAP WAS NOT MATERIAL FOR THE YEARS ENDED MAY 31, 2008, 2007 AND 2006.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTAL DATA

MANAGEMENT OF NIKE, INC. IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE INFORMATION AND REPRESENTATIONS CONTAINED IN THIS REPORT. THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS HAVE BEEN PREPARED IN CONFORMITY WITH THE GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES WE CONSIDERED APPROPRIATE

IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES AND INCLUDE SOME AMOUNTS BASED ON OUR BEST ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS. OTHER FINANCIAL INFORMATION IN THIS REPORT IS CONSISTENT WITH THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

OUR ACCOUNTING SYSTEMS INCLUDE CONTROLS DESIGNED TO REASONABLY ASSURE THAT ASSETS ARE SAFEGUARDED FROM UNAUTHORIZED USE OR DISPOSITION AND WHICH PROVIDE

FOR THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN CONFORMITY WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES. THESE SYSTEMS ARE SUPPLEMENTED BY THE SELECTION AND TRAINING OF QUALIFIED FINANCIAL PERSONNEL AND AN ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE PROVIDING FOR

APPROPRIATE SEGREGATION OF DUTIES.

AN INTERNAL AUDIT DEPARTMENT REVIEWS THE RESULTS OF ITS WORK WITH THE AUDIT COMMITTEE OF THE BOARD OF

DIRECTORS, PRESENTLY CONSISTING OF THREE OUTSIDE DIRECTORS. THE AUDIT COMMITTEE IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE APPOINTMENT OF THE INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM AND REVIEWS WITH THE INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM, MANAGEMENT

AND THE INTERNAL AUDIT STAFF, THE SCOPE AND THE RESULTS OF THE ANNUAL EXAMINATION, THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE ACCOUNTING CONTROL SYSTEM AND OTHER MATTERS RELATING TO THE FINANCIAL AFFAIRS OF NIKE AS THEY DEEM APPROPRIATE. THE INDEPENDENT REGISTERED

PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM AND THE INTERNAL AUDITORS HAVE FULL ACCESS TO THE COMMITTEE, WITH AND WITHOUT THE PRESENCE OF MANAGEMENT, TO DISCUSS ANY APPROPRIATE MATTERS.

MANAGEMENTS ANNUAL REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

MANAGEMENT IS

RESPONSIBLE FOR ESTABLISHING AND MAINTAINING ADEQUATE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, AS SUCH TERM IS DEFINED IN EXCHANGE ACT RULE 13A-15(F). UNDER THE SUPERVISION AND WITH THE PARTICIPATION OF OUR CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND CHIEF

FINANCIAL OFFICER, OUR MANAGEMENT CONDUCTED AN EVALUATION OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING BASED UPON THE FRAMEWORK IN

INTERNAL CONTROL  INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK

ISSUED BY THE COMMITTEE OF SPONSORING

ORGANIZATIONS OF THE TREADWAY COMMISSION. WE HAVE EXCLUDED FROM OUR EVALUATION THE INTERNAL CONTROLS OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING OF UMBRO LTD., WHICH WE ACQUIRED ON MARCH 3, 2008. AS OF MAY 31, 2008 AND FOR THE PERIOD FROM MARCH 3, 2008

THROUGH MAY 31, 2008, TOTAL ASSETS AND TOTAL REVENUES SUBJECT TO UMBRO LTD.S INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING REPRESENTED 7.3% AND 0.3% OF THE COMPANYS CONSOLIDATED TOTAL ASSETS AND TOTAL REVENUES, RESPECTIVELY. BASED ON

THE RESULTS OF OUR EVALUATION, OUR MANAGEMENT CONCLUDED THAT OUR INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING WAS EFFECTIVE AS OF MAY 31, 2008.

INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING CANNOT PROVIDE ABSOLUTE ASSURANCE OF ACHIEVING FINANCIAL REPORTING OBJECTIVES BECAUSE OF ITS INHERENT LIMITATIONS. INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING IS A PROCESS THAT INVOLVES HUMAN

DILIGENCE AND COMPLIANCE AND IS SUBJECT TO LAPSES IN JUDGMENT AND BREAKDOWNS RESULTING FROM HUMAN FAILURES. INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING ALSO CAN BE CIRCUMVENTED BY COLLUSION OR IMPROPER MANAGEMENT OVERRIDE. BECAUSE OF SUCH LIMITATIONS,

THERE IS A RISK THAT MATERIAL MISSTATEMENTS MAY NOT BE PREVENTED OR DETECTED ON A TIMELY BASIS BY INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING. HOWEVER, THESE INHERENT LIMITATIONS ARE KNOWN FEATURES OF THE FINANCIAL REPORTING PROCESS. THEREFORE, IT IS

POSSIBLE TO DESIGN INTO THE PROCESS SAFEGUARDS TO REDUCE, THOUGH NOT ELIMINATE, THIS RISK.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

TO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND

SHAREHOLDERS OF NIKE, INC..

IN OUR OPINION, THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS LISTED IN THE INDEX

APPEARING UNDER ITEM 15(A)(1) PRESENT FAIRLY, IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS, THE FINANCIAL POSITION OF NIKE, INC. AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES AT MAY 31, 2008 AND 2007, AND THE RESULTS OF THEIR OPERATIONS AND THEIR CASH FLOWS FOR EACH OF THE THREE

YEARS IN THE PERIOD ENDED MAY 31, 2008 IN CONFORMITY WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. IN ADDITION, IN OUR OPINION, THE FINANCIAL STATEMENT SCHEDULE LISTED IN THE APPENDIX APPEARING UNDER

ITEM 15(A)(2) PRESENTS FAIRLY IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS, THE INFORMATION SET FORTH THEREIN WHEN READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE RELATED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. ALSO IN OUR OPINION, THE COMPANY MAINTAINED, IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS,

EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF MAY 31, 2008, BASED ON CRITERIA ESTABLISHED IN

INTERNAL CONTROL  INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK

ISSUED BY THE COMMITTEE OF SPONSORING ORGANIZATIONS OF THE TREADWAY COMMISSION (COSO).

THE COMPANYS MANAGEMENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND FINANCIAL STATEMENT SCHEDULE, FOR MAINTAINING EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AND FOR ITS ASSESSMENT OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER

FINANCIAL REPORTING, INCLUDED IN MANAGEMENTS ANNUAL REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING APPEARING UNDER ITEM 8. OUR RESPONSIBILITY IS TO EXPRESS OPINIONS ON THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENT SCHEDULE,

AND ON THE COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING BASED ON OUR INTEGRATED AUDITS. WE CONDUCTED OUR AUDITS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE STANDARDS OF THE PUBLIC COMPANY ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BOARD (UNITED STATES). THOSE STANDARDS REQUIRE

THAT WE PLAN AND PERFORM THE AUDITS TO OBTAIN REASONABLE ASSURANCE ABOUT WHETHER THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE FREE OF MATERIAL MISSTATEMENT AND WHETHER EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING WAS MAINTAINED IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS. OUR

AUDITS OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED EXAMINING, ON A TEST BASIS, EVIDENCE SUPPORTING THE AMOUNTS AND DISCLOSURES IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, ASSESSING THE ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES USED AND SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES MADE BY MANAGEMENT, AND

EVALUATING THE OVERALL FINANCIAL STATEMENT PRESENTATION. OUR AUDIT OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING INCLUDED OBTAINING AN UNDERSTANDING OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, ASSESSING THE RISK THAT A MATERIAL WEAKNESS EXISTS, AND

TESTING AND EVALUATING THE DESIGN AND OPERATING EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL CONTROL BASED ON THE ASSESSED RISK. OUR AUDITS ALSO INCLUDED PERFORMING SUCH OTHER PROCEDURES AS WE CONSIDERED NECESSARY IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR AUDITS

PROVIDE A REASONABLE BASIS FOR OUR OPINIONS.

AS DISCUSSED IN NOTE 1 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, EFFECTIVE JUNE 1, 2006,

THE COMPANY CHANGED THE MANNER IN WHICH IT ACCOUNTS FOR STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS NO. 123R SHARE-BASED PAYMENT.

A COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING IS A PROCESS DESIGNED TO PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING THE RELIABILITY OF FINANCIAL

REPORTING AND THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR EXTERNAL PURPOSES IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES. A COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING INCLUDES THOSE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES THAT

(I) PERTAIN TO THE MAINTENANCE OF RECORDS THAT, IN REASONABLE DETAIL, ACCURATELY AND FAIRLY REFLECT THE TRANSACTIONS AND DISPOSITIONS OF THE ASSETS OF THE COMPANY; (II) PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE THAT TRANSACTIONS ARE RECORDED AS

NECESSARY TO PERMIT PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES, AND THAT RECEIPTS AND EXPENDITURES OF THE COMPANY ARE BEING MADE ONLY IN ACCORDANCE WITH AUTHORIZATIONS OF MANAGEMENT AND DIRECTORS

OF THE COMPANY; AND (III) PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING PREVENTION OR TIMELY DETECTION OF UNAUTHORIZED ACQUISITION, USE, OR DISPOSITION OF THE COMPANYS ASSETS THAT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

BECAUSE OF ITS INHERENT LIMITATIONS, INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING MAY NOT PREVENT OR DETECT MISSTATEMENTS. ALSO, PROJECTIONS

OF ANY EVALUATION OF EFFECTIVENESS TO FUTURE PERIODS ARE SUBJECT TO THE RISK THAT CONTROLS MAY BECOME INADEQUATE BECAUSE OF CHANGES IN CONDITIONS, OR THAT THE DEGREE OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE POLICIES OR PROCEDURES MAY DETERIORATE.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 1  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

BASIS OF CONSOLIDATION

THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDE THE ACCOUNTS OF NIKE, INC. AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES (THE COMPANY). ALL SIGNIFICANT INTERCOMPANY TRANSACTIONS AND BALANCES HAVE BEEN ELIMINATED.

STOCK SPLIT

ON

FEBRUARY 15, 2007 THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS DECLARED A TWO-FOR-ONE STOCK SPLIT OF THE COMPANYS CLASS A AND CLASS B COMMON SHARES, WHICH WAS EFFECTED IN THE FORM OF A 100% COMMON STOCK DIVIDEND DISTRIBUTED ON APRIL 2, 2007. ALL

REFERENCES TO SHARE AND PER SHARE AMOUNTS IN THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND ACCOMPANYING NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS HAVE BEEN RETROACTIVELY RESTATED TO REFLECT THE TWO-FOR-ONE STOCK SPLIT.

RECOGNITION OF REVENUES

WHOLESALE REVENUES ARE RECOGNIZED WHEN THE RISKS AND REWARDS OF OWNERSHIP HAVE PASSED TO THE CUSTOMER, BASED ON THE TERMS OF SALE. THIS OCCURS UPON SHIPMENT OR UPON RECEIPT BY THE CUSTOMER DEPENDING ON THE COUNTRY OF THE SALE AND THE

AGREEMENT WITH THE CUSTOMER. RETAIL STORE REVENUES ARE RECORDED AT THE TIME OF SALE. PROVISIONS FOR SALES DISCOUNTS, RETURNS AND MISCELLANEOUS CLAIMS FROM CUSTOMERS ARE MADE AT THE TIME OF SALE.

SHIPPING AND HANDLING COSTS

SHIPPING AND HANDLING COSTS ARE EXPENSED AS INCURRED AND INCLUDED IN COST OF SALES.

ADVERTISING AND PROMOTION

ADVERTISING PRODUCTION COSTS ARE EXPENSED THE FIRST TIME THE ADVERTISEMENT IS RUN. MEDIA (TV AND PRINT) PLACEMENT COSTS ARE

EXPENSED IN THE MONTH THE ADVERTISING APPEARS.

A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF THE COMPANYS PROMOTIONAL EXPENSES RESULT FROM PAYMENTS UNDER

ENDORSEMENT CONTRACTS. ACCOUNTING FOR ENDORSEMENT PAYMENTS IS BASED UPON SPECIFIC CONTRACT PROVISIONS. GENERALLY, ENDORSEMENT PAYMENTS ARE EXPENSED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THE TERM OF THE CONTRACT AFTER GIVING RECOGNITION TO PERIODIC

PERFORMANCE COMPLIANCE PROVISIONS OF THE CONTRACTS. PREPAYMENTS MADE UNDER CONTRACTS ARE INCLUDED IN PREPAID EXPENSES OR OTHER ASSETS DEPENDING ON THE PERIOD TO WHICH THE PREPAYMENT APPLIES.

THROUGH COOPERATIVE ADVERTISING PROGRAMS, THE COMPANY REIMBURSES ITS RETAIL CUSTOMERS FOR CERTAIN OF THEIR COSTS OF ADVERTISING THE COMPANYS

PRODUCTS. THE COMPANY RECORDS THESE COSTS IN SELLING AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE AT THE POINT IN TIME WHEN IT IS OBLIGATED TO ITS CUSTOMERS FOR THE COSTS, WHICH IS WHEN THE RELATED REVENUES ARE RECOGNIZED. THIS OBLIGATION MAY ARISE PRIOR TO THE

RELATED ADVERTISEMENT BEING RUN.

TOTAL ADVERTISING AND PROMOTION EXPENSES WERE $2,308.3 MILLION, $1,912.4 MILLION, AND $1,740.2 MILLION

FOR THE YEARS ENDED MAY 31, 2008, 2007 AND 2006, RESPECTIVELY. PREPAID ADVERTISING AND PROMOTION EXPENSES RECORDED IN PREPAID EXPENSES AND OTHER ASSETS TOTALED $266.7 MILLION AND $253.0 MILLION AT MAY 31, 2008 AND 2007, RESPECTIVELY.

CASH AND EQUIVALENTS

CASH AND EQUIVALENTS REPRESENT CASH AND SHORT-TERM, HIGHLY LIQUID INVESTMENTS WITH MATURITIES OF THREE MONTHS OR LESS AT DATE OF PURCHASE. THE CARRYING

AMOUNTS REFLECTED IN THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET FOR CASH AND EQUIVALENTS APPROXIMATE FAIR VALUE.

SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS

SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS CONSIST OF HIGHLY LIQUID INVESTMENTS, PRIMARILY COMMERCIAL PAPER, U.S. TREASURY, U.S. AGENCY, AND CORPORATE DEBT

SECURITIES, WITH MATURITIES OVER THREE MONTHS FROM THE DATE OF PURCHASE. DEBT SECURITIES WHICH THE COMPANY HAS THE ABILITY AND POSITIVE INTENT TO HOLD TO MATURITY ARE CARRIED AT AMORTIZED COST, WHICH APPROXIMATES FAIR VALUE. SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS

OF $124.9 MILLION AND $975.4 MILLION AT MAY 31, 2008 AND 2007, RESPECTIVELY, WERE CLASSIFIED AS HELD-TO-MATURITY AND PRIMARILY COMPRISED OF U.S. TREASURY AND U.S. AGENCY SECURITIES. ALL HELD-TO-MATURITY SECURITIES AT MAY 31, 2008 HAVE

MATURITY DATES WITHIN ONE YEAR.

AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE DEBT SECURITIES ARE RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE WITH NET UNREALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES

REPORTED, NET OF TAX, IN OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME, UNLESS UNREALIZED LOSSES ARE DETERMINED TO BE OTHER THAN TEMPORARY. THE COMPANY CONSIDERS ALL AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE SECURITIES, INCLUDING THOSE WITH MATURITY DATES BEYOND 12 MONTHS, AS AVAILABLE TO

SUPPORT CURRENT OPERATIONAL LIQUIDITY NEEDS AND THEREFORE CLASSIFIES THESE SECURITIES AS CURRENT ASSETS WITHIN SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET. AS OF MAY 31, 2008, THE COMPANY HELD $432.3 MILLION OF AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE

SECURITIES WITH MATURITY DATES WITHIN ONE YEAR AND $85.0 MILLION WITH MATURITY DATES OVER ONE YEAR AND LESS THAN FIVE YEARS.

ALLOWANCE FOR UNCOLLECTIBLE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE

ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE CONSISTS PRINCIPALLY OF AMOUNTS RECEIVABLE FROM

CUSTOMERS. WE MAKE ONGOING ESTIMATES RELATING TO THE COLLECTIBILITY OF OUR ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND MAINTAIN AN ALLOWANCE FOR ESTIMATED LOSSES RESULTING FROM THE INABILITY OF OUR CUSTOMERS TO MAKE REQUIRED PAYMENTS. IN DETERMINING THE AMOUNT OF THE

ALLOWANCE, WE CONSIDER OUR HISTORICAL LEVEL OF CREDIT LOSSES AND MAKE JUDGMENTS ABOUT THE CREDITWORTHINESS OF SIGNIFICANT CUSTOMERS BASED ON ONGOING CREDIT EVALUATIONS. ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE WITH ANTICIPATED COLLECTION DATES GREATER THAN TWELVE MONTHS

FROM THE BALANCE SHEET DATE AND RELATED ALLOWANCES ARE CONSIDERED NON-CURRENT AND RECORDED IN OTHER ASSETS. THE ALLOWANCE FOR UNCOLLECTIBLE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE WAS $78.4 MILLION AND $71.5 MILLION AT MAY 31, 2008 AND 2007, RESPECTIVELY, OF WHICH

$36.7 MILLION AND $33.3 MILLION WAS RECORDED IN OTHER ASSETS.

INVENTORY VALUATION

INVENTORIES RELATED TO OUR WHOLESALE OPERATIONS ARE STATED AT LOWER OF COST OR MARKET AND VALUED ON A FIRST-IN, FIRST-OUT (FIFO) OR MOVING

AVERAGE COST BASIS. INVENTORIES RELATED TO OUR RETAIL OPERATIONS ARE STATED AT THE LOWER OF AVERAGE COST OR MARKET USING THE RETAIL INVENTORY METHOD. UNDER THE RETAIL INVENTORY METHOD, THE VALUATION OF INVENTORIES AT COST IS CALCULATED BY

APPLYING A COST-TO-RETAIL RATIO TO THE RETAIL VALUE INVENTORIES. PERMANENT AND POINT OF SALE MARKDOWNS, WHEN RECORDED, REDUCE BOTH THE RETAIL AND COST COMPONENTS OF INVENTORY ON HAND SO AS TO MAINTAIN THE ALREADY ESTABLISHED COST-TO-RETAIL

RELATIONSHIP.

PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT AND DEPRECIATION

PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT ARE RECORDED AT COST. DEPRECIATION FOR FINANCIAL REPORTING PURPOSES IS DETERMINED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS FOR BUILDINGS AND

LEASEHOLD IMPROVEMENTS OVER 2 TO 40 YEARS AND FOR MACHINERY AND EQUIPMENT OVER 2 TO 15 YEARS. COMPUTER SOFTWARE (INCLUDING, IN SOME CASES, THE COST OF INTERNAL LABOR) IS DEPRECIATED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER 3 TO 10 YEARS.

IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS

THE COMPANY ESTIMATES THE FUTURE UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS TO BE DERIVED FROM AN ASSET TO ASSESS WHETHER OR NOT A POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT EXISTS WHEN EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THE CARRYING VALUE OF A LONG-LIVED ASSET MAY BE IMPAIRED. IF

THE CARRYING VALUE EXCEEDS THE COMPANYS ESTIMATE OF FUTURE UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS, THE COMPANY THEN CALCULATES THE IMPAIRMENT AS THE EXCESS OF THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE ASSET OVER THE COMPANYS ESTIMATE OF ITS FAIR MARKET VALUE.

IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND GOODWILL

GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS WITH INDEFINITE LIVES ARE NOT AMORTIZED BUT INSTEAD ARE MEASURED FOR IMPAIRMENT AT LEAST ANNUALLY IN THE FOURTH QUARTER, OR WHEN EVENTS INDICATE THAT AN IMPAIRMENT EXISTS. AS REQUIRED BY

STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS (SFAS) NO. 142, GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS (FAS 142), IN THE COMPANYS IMPAIRMENT TEST OF GOODWILL, THE COMPANY COMPARES THE FAIR VALUE OF THE

APPLICABLE REPORTING UNIT TO ITS CARRYING VALUE. THE COMPANY ESTIMATES THE FAIR VALUE OF ITS REPORTING UNITS BY USING A COMBINATION OF DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW ANALYSIS AND COMPARISONS WITH THE MARKET VALUES OF SIMILAR PUBLICLY TRADED COMPANIES. IF THE

CARRYING VALUE OF THE REPORTING UNIT EXCEEDS THE ESTIMATE OF FAIR VALUE, THE COMPANY CALCULATES THE IMPAIRMENT AS THE EXCESS OF THE CARRYING VALUE OF GOODWILL OVER ITS IMPLIED FAIR VALUE. IN THE IMPAIRMENT TESTS FOR INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE

ASSETS, THE COMPANY COMPARES THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF THE INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS TO THE CARRYING VALUE. THE COMPANY ESTIMATES THE FAIR VALUE OF INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND TRADEMARKS USING THE RELIEF FROM ROYALTY APPROACH,

WHICH IS A STANDARD FORM OF DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW ANALYSIS USED FOR THE VALUATION OF TRADEMARKS. IF THE CARRYING VALUE EXCEEDS THE ESTIMATE OF FAIR VALUE, THE COMPANY CALCULATES IMPAIRMENT AS THE EXCESS OF THE CARRYING VALUE OVER THE ESTIMATE OF FAIR

VALUE.

INTANGIBLE ASSETS THAT ARE DETERMINED TO HAVE DEFINITE LIVES ARE AMORTIZED OVER THEIR USEFUL LIVES AND ARE MEASURED FOR IMPAIRMENT

ONLY WHEN EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THE CARRYING VALUE MAY BE IMPAIRED.

FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION AND FOREIGN CURRENCY

TRANSACTIONS

ADJUSTMENTS RESULTING FROM TRANSLATING FOREIGN FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INTO U.S. DOLLARS ARE INCLUDED

IN THE FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENT, A COMPONENT OF ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME IN SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (CONTINUED)

TRANSACTION GAINS AND LOSSES GENERATED BY THE EFFECT OF FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES ON RECORDED ASSETS AND

LIABILITIES DENOMINATED IN A CURRENCY DIFFERENT FROM THE FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY OF THE APPLICABLE COMPANY ENTITY ARE RECORDED IN OTHER (EXPENSE) INCOME, NET, IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH THEY OCCUR.

ACCOUNTING FOR DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES

THE COMPANY USES DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS TO LIMIT EXPOSURE TO CHANGES IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES AND INTEREST RATES. THE COMPANY ACCOUNTS FOR DERIVATIVES PURSUANT TO SFAS NO. 133,

ACCOUNTING FOR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES, AS AMENDED AND INTERPRETED (FAS 133). FAS 133 ESTABLISHES ACCOUNTING AND REPORTING STANDARDS FOR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND REQUIRES THAT ALL DERIVATIVES BE

RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE ON THE BALANCE SHEET. CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS ARE EITHER RECOGNIZED IN OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (A COMPONENT OF SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY) OR NET INCOME DEPENDING ON WHETHER THE

DERIVATIVE IS BEING USED TO HEDGE CHANGES IN CASH FLOWS OR FAIR VALUE.

SEE NOTE 16 FOR MORE INFORMATION ON THE COMPANYS RISK

MANAGEMENT PROGRAM AND DERIVATIVES.

STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION

ON JUNE 1, 2006, THE COMPANY ADOPTED SFAS NO. 123R SHARE-BASED PAYMENT (FAS 123R) WHICH REQUIRES THE COMPANY TO RECORD

EXPENSE FOR STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION TO EMPLOYEES USING A FAIR VALUE METHOD. UNDER FAS 123R, THE COMPANY ESTIMATES THE FAIR VALUE OF OPTIONS GRANTED UNDER THE NIKE, INC. 1990 STOCK INCENTIVE PLAN (THE 1990 PLAN) (SEE NOTE 10) AND

EMPLOYEES PURCHASE RIGHTS UNDER THE EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLANS (ESPPS) USING THE BLACK-SCHOLES OPTION PRICING MODEL. THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES THIS FAIR VALUE, NET OF ESTIMATED FORFEITURES, AS SELLING AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE IN

THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME OVER THE VESTING PERIOD USING THE STRAIGHT-LINE METHOD.

THE COMPANY HAS ADOPTED THE MODIFIED

PROSPECTIVE TRANSITION METHOD PRESCRIBED BY FAS 123R, WHICH DOES NOT REQUIRE THE RESTATEMENT OF FINANCIAL RESULTS FOR PREVIOUS PERIODS. IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS TRANSITION METHOD, THE COMPANYS CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF INCOME FOR THE YEAR ENDED

MAY 31, 2008 AND 2007 INCLUDES (1) AMORTIZATION OF OUTSTANDING STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION GRANTED PRIOR TO, BUT NOT VESTED, AS OF JUNE 1, 2006, BASED ON THE FAIR VALUE ESTIMATED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE ORIGINAL PROVISIONS OF SFAS

NO. 123, ACCOUNTING FOR STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION (FAS 123) AND (2) AMORTIZATION OF ALL STOCK-BASED AWARDS GRANTED SUBSEQUENT TO JUNE 1, 2006, BASED ON THE FAIR VALUE ESTIMATED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE PROVISIONS

OF FAS 123R.

PRIOR TO THE ADOPTION OF FAS 123R, THE COMPANY USED THE INTRINSIC VALUE METHOD TO ACCOUNT FOR STOCK

OPTIONS AND ESPP SHARES IN ACCORDANCE WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES BOARD OPINION NO. 25, ACCOUNTING FOR STOCK ISSUED TO EMPLOYEES AS PERMITTED BY FAS 123. IF THE COMPANY HAD INSTEAD ACCOUNTED FOR STOCK OPTIONS AND ESPP SHARES ISSUED

ACCELERATED STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE FOR OPTIONS SUBJECT TO ACCELERATED VESTING DUE TO EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT IS

NOT INCLUDED IN THE PRO FORMA FIGURES SHOWN ABOVE FOR THE YEAR ENDED MAY 31, 2006. THIS DISCLOSURE REFLECTS THE EXPENSE OF SUCH OPTIONS RATABLY OVER THE STATED VESTING PERIOD OR UPON ACTUAL EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT. HAD THE COMPANY RECOGNIZED THE

FAIR VALUE FOR SUCH STOCK OPTIONS ON AN ACCELERATED BASIS IN THIS PRO FORMA DISCLOSURE, THE COMPANY WOULD HAVE RECOGNIZED ADDITIONAL STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE OF $17.5 MILLION, NET OF TAX, OR $0.03 PER DILUTED SHARE FOR THE YEAR ENDED

MAY 31, 2006.

TO CALCULATE THE EXCESS TAX BENEFITS AVAILABLE FOR USE IN OFFSETTING FUTURE TAX SHORTFALLS AS OF THE

DATE OF IMPLEMENTATION, THE COMPANY IS FOLLOWING THE ALTERNATIVE TRANSITION METHOD DISCUSSED IN FASB STAFF POSITION NO. 123R-3, TRANSITION ELECTION RELATING TO ACCOUNTING FOR THE TAX EFFECTS OF SHARE-BASED PAYMENT AWARDS.

SEE NOTE 10 FOR MORE INFORMATION ON THE COMPANYS STOCK PROGRAMS.

INCOME TAXES

THE COMPANY

ACCOUNTS FOR INCOME TAXES USING THE ASSET AND LIABILITY METHOD. THIS APPROACH REQUIRES THE RECOGNITION OF DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES FOR THE EXPECTED FUTURE TAX CONSEQUENCES OF TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE CARRYING AMOUNTS AND THE TAX

BASIS OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. UNITED STATES INCOME TAXES ARE PROVIDED CURRENTLY ON FINANCIAL STATEMENT EARNINGS OF NON-U.S. SUBSIDIARIES THAT ARE EXPECTED TO BE REPATRIATED. THE COMPANY DETERMINES ANNUALLY THE AMOUNT OF UNDISTRIBUTED NON-U.S.

EARNINGS TO INVEST INDEFINITELY IN ITS NON-U.S. OPERATIONS. THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES INTEREST AND PENALTIES RELATED TO INCOME TAX MATTERS IN INCOME TAX EXPENSE. SEE NOTE 8 FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION.

EARNINGS PER SHARE

BASIC EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE IS CALCULATED BY DIVIDING NET INCOME BY THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE NUMBER OF COMMON SHARES OUTSTANDING DURING THE YEAR. DILUTED

EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE IS CALCULATED BY ADJUSTING WEIGHTED AVERAGE OUTSTANDING SHARES, ASSUMING CONVERSION OF ALL POTENTIALLY DILUTIVE STOCK OPTIONS AND AWARDS. SEE NOTE 11 FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION.

MANAGEMENT ESTIMATES

THE

PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN CONFORMITY WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO MAKE ESTIMATES, INCLUDING ESTIMATES RELATING TO ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AND

DISCLOSURE OF CONTINGENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AT THE DATE OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF REVENUES AND EXPENSES DURING THE REPORTING PERIOD. ACTUAL RESULTS COULD DIFFER FROM THESE ESTIMATES.

RECLASSIFICATIONS

CERTAIN

PRIOR YEAR AMOUNTS HAVE BEEN RECLASSIFIED TO CONFORM TO FISCAL YEAR 2008 PRESENTATION. THESE CHANGES HAD NO IMPACT ON PREVIOUSLY REPORTED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY.

RECENTLY ADOPTED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

IN JUNE 2006, THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD (FASB) ISSUED FASB INTERPRETATION NO. 48, ACCOUNTING FOR UNCERTAINTY IN INCOME TAXES (FIN 48). FIN 48 CLARIFIES THE ACCOUNTING FOR UNCERTAINTY

IN INCOME TAXES RECOGNIZED IN THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH FASB STATEMENT NO. 109, ACCOUNTING FOR INCOME TAXES. THE COMPANY ADOPTED THE PROVISIONS OF FIN 48 ON JUNE 1, 2007. SEE NOTE 8 FOR FURTHER

DISCUSSION.

IN JUNE 2006, THE FASB RATIFIED THE CONSENSUS REACHED ON EMERGING ISSUES TASK FORCE (EITF) ISSUE NO. 06-2,

ACCOUNTING FOR SABBATICAL LEAVE AND OTHER SIMILAR BENEFITS PURSUANT TO FASB STATEMENT NO. 43 (EITF 06-2). EITF 06-2 CLARIFIES RECOGNITION GUIDANCE ON THE ACCRUAL OF EMPLOYEES RIGHTS TO COMPENSATED ABSENCES UNDER A

SABBATICAL OR OTHER SIMILAR BENEFIT ARRANGEMENT. THE ADOPTION OF EITF 06-2 ON JUNE 1, 2007 DID NOT HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE COMPANYS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL POSITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR CASH FLOWS.

RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

IN SEPTEMBER 2006, THE FASB ISSUED SFAS NO. 157, FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS (FAS 157). FAS 157 DEFINES FAIR VALUE, ESTABLISHES A FRAMEWORK FOR MEASURING FAIR VALUE IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING

PRINCIPLES, AND EXPANDS DISCLOSURES ABOUT FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS. THE PROVISIONS OF FAS 157 FOR FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE EFFECTIVE FOR THE FISCAL YEAR BEGINNING JUNE 1, 2008 AND THE PROVISIONS OF FAS 157 FOR NON FINANCIAL ASSETS

AND LIABILITIES EXCEPT FOR ITEMS RECOGNIZED AT FAIR VALUE ON A RECURRING BASIS ARE EFFECTIVE FOR THE FISCAL YEAR BEGINNING JUNE 1, 2009. THE COMPANY IS CURRENTLY EVALUATING THE IMPACT OF THE PROVISIONS FOR NON FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES.

THE COMPANY HAS EVALUATED THE PROVISIONS OF FAS 157 FOR FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AND DOES NOT EXPECT THAT THE ADOPTION WILL HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE COMPANYS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL POSITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

IN FEBRUARY 2007, THE FASB ISSUED SFAS NO. 159, THE FAIR VALUE OPTION FOR FINANCIAL ASSETS AND FINANCIAL LIABILITIES INCLUDING AN AMENDMENT OF

FASB STATEMENT NO. 115 (FAS 159). FAS 159 PERMITS ENTITIES TO CHOOSE TO MEASURE MANY FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND CERTAIN OTHER ITEMS AT FAIR VALUE. THE PROVISIONS OF

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (CONTINUED)

FAS 159 ARE EFFECTIVE FOR THE FISCAL YEAR BEGINNING JUNE 1, 2008. THE COMPANY HAS EVALUATED THE IMPACT OF THE PROVISIONS OF FAS 159 AND DOES NOT EXPECT

THAT THE ADOPTION WILL HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE COMPANYS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL POSITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

IN DECEMBER

2007, THE FASB ISSUED SFAS NO. 141 (REVISED 2007), BUSINESS COMBINATIONS (FAS 141(R)) AND SFAS NO. 160, NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS IN CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (FAS 160). THESE

STANDARDS AIM TO IMPROVE, SIMPLIFY, AND CONVERGE INTERNATIONALLY THE ACCOUNTING FOR BUSINESS COMBINATIONS AND THE REPORTING OF NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS IN CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. THE PROVISIONS OF FAS 141(R) AND FAS 160 ARE EFFECTIVE FOR

THE FISCAL YEAR BEGINNING JUNE 1, 2009. THE COMPANY IS CURRENTLY EVALUATING THE IMPACT OF THE PROVISIONS OF FAS 141(R) AND FAS 160.

IN MARCH 2008, THE FASB ISSUED SFAS NO. 161, DISCLOSURES ABOUT DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES (FAS 161). FAS 161 IS INTENDED TO IMPROVE FINANCIAL REPORTING ABOUT DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING

ACTIVITIES BY REQUIRING ENHANCED DISCLOSURES TO ENABLE INVESTORS TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THEIR EFFECTS ON AN ENTITYS FINANCIAL POSITION, FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE, AND CASH FLOWS. THE PROVISIONS OF FAS 161 ARE EFFECTIVE FOR THE QUARTER ENDING

FEBRUARY 28, 2009. THE COMPANY DOES NOT EXPECT THAT THE ADOPTION WILL HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE COMPANYS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL POSITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR THE YEAR ENDED MAY 31, 2008 OF 24.8% DECREASED FROM THE FISCAL

2007 EFFECTIVE TAX RATE OF 32.2%. OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS, A NUMBER OF INTERNATIONAL ENTITIES GENERATED LOSSES FOR WHICH THE COMPANY DID NOT RECOGNIZE OFFSETTING TAX BENEFITS BECAUSE THE REALIZATION OF THOSE BENEFITS WAS UNCERTAIN. THE

NECESSARY STEPS TO REALIZE THESE BENEFITS HAVE NOW BEEN TAKEN RESULTING IN A ONE-TIME REDUCTION OF THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR THE YEAR ENDED MAY 31, 2008 OF 4.2 PERCENTAGE POINTS. ALSO REFLECTED IN THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR THE YEAR ENDED

MAY 31, 2008 IS A REDUCTION IN OUR ON-GOING EFFECTIVE TAX RATE RESULTING FROM OUR OPERATIONS OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES; OUR TAX RATES ON THESE OPERATIONS ARE GENERALLY LOWER THAN THE U.S. STATUTORY RATE. THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR THE YEAR

ENDED MAY 31, 2007 OF 32.2% DECREASED FROM THE FISCAL 2006 EFFECTIVE TAX RATE OF 35.0%. THE DECREASE IS PRIMARILY DUE TO A EUROPEAN TAX AGREEMENT ENTERED INTO DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2006. THE COMPANY RECORDED A

RETROACTIVE BENEFIT FOR THE EUROPEAN TAX AGREEMENT DURING THE YEAR ENDED MAY 31, 2007.

THE COMPANY ADOPTED FIN 48 EFFECTIVE

JUNE 1, 2007. UPON ADOPTION, THE COMPANY RECOGNIZED AN ADDITIONAL LONG-TERM LIABILITY OF $89.4 MILLION FOR UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS, $15.6 MILLION OF WHICH WAS RECORDED AS A REDUCTION TO THE COMPANYS BEGINNING RETAINED EARNINGS, AND THE

REMAINING $73.8 MILLION WAS RECORDED AS A REDUCTION TO THE COMPANYS NONCURRENT DEFERRED TAX LIABILITY. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY RECLASSIFIED $12.2 MILLION OF UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS FROM INCOME TAXES PAYABLE TO OTHER LONG TERM LIABILITIES IN

CONJUNCTION WITH THE ADOPTION OF FIN 48.

AT THE ADOPTION DATE OF JUNE 1, 2007, THE COMPANY HAD $122.5 MILLION OF GROSS UNRECOGNIZED

TAX BENEFITS, EXCLUDING RELATED INTEREST AND PENALTIES, $30.7 MILLION OF WHICH WOULD AFFECT THE COMPANYS EFFECTIVE TAX RATE IF RECOGNIZED IN FUTURE PERIODS. INCLUDING RELATED INTEREST AND PENALTIES AND NET OF FEDERAL BENEFIT OF INTEREST AND

UNRECOGNIZED STATE TAX BENEFITS, AT JUNE 1, 2007, THE COMPANY HAD $135.0 MILLION OF TOTAL UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS, $52.0 MILLION OF WHICH WOULD AFFECT THE COMPANYS EFFECTIVE TAX RATE IF RECOGNIZED IN FUTURE PERIODS. AS OF MAY 31,

2008, THE TOTAL GROSS UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS, EXCLUDING RELATED INTEREST AND PENALTIES, WERE $251.1 MILLION, $60.6 MILLION OF WHICH WOULD AFFECT THE COMPANYS EFFECTIVE TAX RATE IF RECOGNIZED IN FUTURE PERIODS. THE COMPANY DOES NOT

ANTICIPATE THAT TOTAL UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS WILL CHANGE SIGNIFICANTLY WITHIN THE NEXT 12 MONTHS.

THE COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO TAXATION PRIMARILY IN THE UNITED STATES, CHINA AND THE NETHERLANDS AS WELL

AS VARIOUS STATE AND OTHER FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS. THE COMPANY HAS CONCLUDED SUBSTANTIALLY ALL U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX MATTERS THROUGH FISCAL YEAR 2004. THE COMPANY IS CURRENTLY UNDER AUDIT BY THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE FOR THE 2005 AND 2006 TAX

YEARS. THE COMPANYS MAJOR FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS, CHINA AND THE NETHERLANDS, HAVE CONCLUDED SUBSTANTIALLY ALL INCOME TAX MATTERS THROUGH CALENDAR YEAR 1997 AND FISCAL YEAR 2002, RESPECTIVELY.

THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES INTEREST AND PENALTIES RELATED TO INCOME TAX MATTERS IN INCOME TAX EXPENSE. UPON ADOPTION AT JUNE 1, 2007, THE COMPANY HAD

$32.0 MILLION (EXCLUDING FEDERAL BENEFIT) ACCRUED FOR INTEREST AND PENALTIES RELATED TO UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS. THE LIABILITY FOR PAYMENT OF INTEREST AND PENALTIES INCREASED $41.2 MILLION DURING THE YEAR ENDED MAY 31, 2008. AS OF MAY 31,

2008, ACCRUED INTEREST AND PENALTIES RELATED TO UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS WAS $73.2 MILLION (EXCLUDING FEDERAL BENEFIT).

DURING THE QUARTER

ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2005, THE COMPANYS CEO AND BOARD OF DIRECTORS APPROVED A DOMESTIC REINVESTMENT PLAN AS REQUIRED BY THE AMERICAN JOBS CREATION ACT OF 2004 (THE ACT) TO REPATRIATE $500 MILLION OF FOREIGN EARNINGS IN

FISCAL 2006. THE ACT CREATED A TEMPORARY INCENTIVE FOR U.S. MULTINATIONAL CORPORATIONS TO REPATRIATE ACCUMULATED INCOME EARNED OUTSIDE THE U.S. BY PROVIDING AN 85% DIVIDEND RECEIVED DEDUCTION FOR CERTAIN DIVIDENDS FROM CONTROLLED FOREIGN

CORPORATIONS. A $500 MILLION REPATRIATION WAS MADE DURING THE QUARTER ENDED MAY 31, 2006 COMPRISED OF BOTH FOREIGN EARNINGS FOR WHICH U.S. TAXES HAVE PREVIOUSLY BEEN PROVIDED AND FOREIGN EARNINGS THAT HAD BEEN DESIGNATED AS PERMANENTLY

REINVESTED. ACCORDINGLY, THE PROVISIONS MADE DID NOT HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE COMPANYS INCOME TAX EXPENSE OR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR THE YEARS ENDED MAY 31, 2008, 2007 AND 2006.

THE COMPANY HAS INDEFINITELY REINVESTED APPROXIMATELY $1,808.6 MILLION OF THE CUMULATIVE UNDISTRIBUTED EARNINGS OF CERTAIN FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES. SUCH

EARNINGS WOULD BE SUBJECT TO U.S. TAXATION IF REPATRIATED TO THE U.S. DETERMINATION OF THE AMOUNT OF UNRECOGNIZED DEFERRED TAX LIABILITY ASSOCIATED WITH THE PERMANENTLY REINVESTED CUMULATIVE UNDISTRIBUTED EARNINGS IS NOT PRACTICABLE.

DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AT MAY 31, 2008, 2007 AND 2006 WERE REDUCED BY A VALUATION ALLOWANCE RELATING TO TAX BENEFITS OF CERTAIN FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES

WITH OPERATING LOSSES WHERE IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT THE DEFERRED TAX ASSETS WILL NOT BE REALIZED.

DURING THE YEARS ENDED

MAY 31, 2008, 2007, AND 2006, INCOME TAX BENEFITS ATTRIBUTABLE TO EMPLOYEE STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION TRANSACTIONS OF $68.9 MILLION, $56.6 MILLION, AND $54.2 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, WERE ALLOCATED TO SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY.

IN 1990, THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS ADOPTED, AND THE SHAREHOLDERS APPROVED, THE NIKE, INC. 1990 STOCK INCENTIVE PLAN (THE 1990 PLAN). THE 1990 PLAN PROVIDES FOR THE ISSUANCE OF UP TO 132 MILLION

BONUSES AND THE ISSUANCE AND SALE OF RESTRICTED STOCK. THE EXERCISE PRICE FOR NON-STATUTORY STOCK OPTIONS, STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS AND THE GRANT PRICE OF RESTRICTED STOCK MAY NOT BE LESS THAN 75% OF THE FAIR MARKET VALUE OF THE UNDERLYING SHARES

ON THE DATE OF GRANT. THE EXERCISE PRICE FOR INCENTIVE STOCK OPTIONS MAY NOT BE LESS THAN THE FAIR MARKET VALUE OF THE UNDERLYING SHARES ON THE DATE OF GRANT. A COMMITTEE OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS ADMINISTERS THE 1990 PLAN. THE COMMITTEE HAS THE

AUTHORITY TO DETERMINE THE EMPLOYEES TO WHOM AWARDS WILL BE MADE, THE AMOUNT OF THE AWARDS, AND THE OTHER TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THE AWARDS. THE COMMITTEE HAS GRANTED SUBSTANTIALLY ALL STOCK OPTIONS AT 100% OF THE MARKET PRICE ON THE DATE OF GRANT.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

NIKE, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (CONTINUED)

IN CASH (APPROXIMATELY $576.4 MILLION), INCLUSIVE OF DIRECT TRANSACTION COSTS. THIS ACQUISITION IS INTENDED TO SIGNIFICANTLY STRENGTHEN OUR MARKET POSITION

IN THE UNITED KINGDOM AND EXPAND NIKES GLOBAL LEADERSHIP IN SOCCER, A KEY AREA OF GROWTH FOR THE COMPANY. THIS ACQUISITION ALSO PROVIDES SCALED POSITIONS IN EMERGING SOCCER MARKETS SUCH AS CHINA, RUSSIA AND BRAZIL. THE RESULTS OF UMBROS

OPERATIONS HAVE BEEN INCLUDED IN THE COMPANYS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SINCE THE DATE OF ACQUISITION AS PART OF THE COMPANYS OTHER OPERATING SEGMENT.

THE ACQUISITION OF UMBRO WAS ACCOUNTED FOR AS A PURCHASE BUSINESS COMBINATION IN ACCORDANCE WITH SFAS NO. 141 BUSINESS COMBINATIONS. THE PURCHASE PRICE WAS ALLOCATED TO TANGIBLE AND IDENTIFIABLE

INTANGIBLE ASSETS ACQUIRED AND LIABILITIES ASSUMED BASED ON THEIR RESPECTIVE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUES ON THE DATE OF ACQUISITION, WITH THE REMAINING PURCHASE PRICE RECORDED AS GOODWILL. THE VALUATION OF THESE TANGIBLE AND IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS

AND LIABILITIES MAY BE ADJUSTED IN FUTURE PERIODS, SUBJECT TO THE AVAILABILITY OF ADDITIONAL INFORMATION DURING THE ALLOCATION PERIOD REGARDING A PRE-ACQUISITION LEGAL CONTINGENCY.

BASED ON OUR PURCHASE PRICE ALLOCATION, IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND GOODWILL RELATING TO THE PURCHASE APPROXIMATED $419.5 MILLION AND $319.2

MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. GOODWILL RECOGNIZED IN THIS TRANSACTION IS DEDUCTIBLE FOR TAX PURPOSES. IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS INCLUDE $378.4 MILLION FOR TRADEMARKS THAT HAVE AN INDEFINITE LIFE, AND $41.1 MILLION FOR OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS

CONSISTING OF UMBROS SOURCING NETWORK, ESTABLISHED CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIPS, AND THE UNITED SOCCER LEAGUE FRANCHISE. THESE INTANGIBLE ASSETS WILL BE AMORTIZED ON A STRAIGHT LINE BASIS OVER ESTIMATED LIVES OF 12 TO 20 YEARS.

DIVESTITURES

ON DECEMBER 17, 2007, THE COMPANY COMPLETED THE SALE OF THE STARTER BRAND BUSINESS TO ICONIX BRAND GROUP, INC. FOR $60.0 MILLION IN CASH. THIS TRANSACTION RESULTED IN A GAIN OF $28.6 MILLION DURING THE YEAR ENDED MAY 31, 2008.

ON APRIL 17, 2008, THE COMPANY COMPLETED THE SALE OF NIKE BAUER HOCKEY CORP. FOR $189.2 MILLION IN CASH TO A GROUP OF PRIVATE

INVESTORS (THE BUYER). THE SALE RESULTED IN A NET GAIN OF $32.0 MILLION RECORDED IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF THE YEAR ENDED MAY 31, 2008. THIS GAIN INCLUDED THE RECOGNITION OF A $46.3 MILLION CUMULATIVE FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (CONTINUED)

CERTAIN NIKE TRADEMARKS FOR A TRANSITIONAL PERIOD OF APPROXIMATELY TWO YEARS. THE COMPANY DEFERRED $41.0 MILLION OF THE SALE PROCEEDS RELATED TO THIS LICENSE

AGREEMENT, TO BE RECOGNIZED OVER THE LICENSE PERIOD.

THE GAINS RESULTING FROM THESE DIVESTITURES ARE REFLECTED IN OTHER (EXPENSE) INCOME,

NET AND IN THE CORPORATE LINE IN THE SEGMENT PRESENTATION OF PRE-TAX INCOME IN NOTE 17.

NOTE 16  RISK MANAGEMENT AND DERIVATIVES

THE COMPANY IS EXPOSED TO GLOBAL MARKET RISKS, INCLUDING THE EFFECT OF CHANGES IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES AND INTEREST RATES. THE COMPANY USES

DERIVATIVES TO MANAGE FINANCIAL EXPOSURES THAT OCCUR IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS. THE COMPANY DOES NOT HOLD OR ISSUE DERIVATIVES FOR TRADING PURPOSES.

THE COMPANY FORMALLY DOCUMENTS ALL RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN HEDGING INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGED ITEMS, AS WELL AS ITS RISK-MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVE AND STRATEGY FOR UNDERTAKING HEDGE TRANSACTIONS. THIS PROCESS INCLUDES LINKING

ALL DERIVATIVES TO EITHER SPECIFIC ASSETS OR LIABILITIES ON THE BALANCE SHEET OR SPECIFIC FIRM COMMITMENTS OR FORECASTED TRANSACTIONS.

SUBSTANTIALLY ALL DERIVATIVES OUTSTANDING AS OF MAY 31, 2008 AND 2007 ARE DESIGNATED AS EITHER CASH FLOW, FAIR VALUE HEDGES OR NET INVESTMENT HEDGES. ALL DERIVATIVES ARE RECOGNIZED ON THE BALANCE SHEET AT THEIR FAIR VALUE. UNREALIZED

GAIN POSITIONS ARE RECORDED AS OTHER CURRENT ASSETS OR OTHER NON-CURRENT ASSETS, DEPENDING ON THE INSTRUMENTS MATURITY DATE. UNREALIZED LOSS POSITIONS ARE RECORDED AS ACCRUED LIABILITIES OR OTHER NON-CURRENT LIABILITIES. ALL CHANGES IN FAIR

VALUES OF OUTSTANDING CASH FLOW HEDGE DERIVATIVES, EXCEPT THE INEFFECTIVE PORTION, ARE RECORDED IN OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME, UNTIL NET INCOME IS AFFECTED BY THE VARIABILITY OF CASH FLOWS OF THE HEDGED TRANSACTION. CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF

HEDGES DESIGNATED AS FAIR VALUE HEDGES ARE RECORDED IN NET INCOME AND ARE OFFSET BY THE CHANGE IN FAIR VALUE OF THE UNDERLYING ASSET OR LIABILITY BEING HEDGED. CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUES OF OUTSTANDING NET INVESTMENT HEDGES, EXCEPT ANY INEFFECTIVE

PORTION, ARE RECORDED WITHIN THE CUMULATIVE TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENT COMPONENT OF OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME.

CASH FLOW HEDGES

THE PURPOSE OF THE COMPANYS FOREIGN CURRENCY HEDGING ACTIVITIES IS TO PROTECT THE COMPANY FROM THE RISK THAT THE EVENTUAL

CASH FLOWS RESULTING FROM TRANSACTIONS IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES, INCLUDING REVENUES, PRODUCT COSTS, SELLING AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES, INVESTMENTS IN U.S. DOLLAR-DENOMINATED AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE DEBT SECURITIES AND INTERCOMPANY TRANSACTIONS, INCLUDING

INTERCOMPANY BORROWINGS, WILL BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY CHANGES IN EXCHANGE RATES. IT IS THE COMPANYS POLICY TO UTILIZE DERIVATIVES TO REDUCE FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISKS WHERE INTERNAL NETTING STRATEGIES CANNOT BE EFFECTIVELY EMPLOYED.

DERIVATIVES USED BY THE COMPANY TO HEDGE FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RISKS ARE FORWARD EXCHANGE CONTRACTS AND OPTIONS. HEDGED TRANSACTIONS ARE

DENOMINATED PRIMARILY IN EUROS, BRITISH POUNDS AND JAPANESE YEN. THE COMPANY HEDGES UP TO 100% OF ANTICIPATED EXPOSURES TYPICALLY TWELVE MONTHS IN ADVANCE, BUT HAS HEDGED AS MUCH AS 34 MONTHS IN ADVANCE. WHEN INTERCOMPANY LOANS ARE HEDGED, IT IS

TYPICALLY FOR THEIR EXPECTED DURATION.

ALL CHANGES IN FAIR VALUES OF OUTSTANDING CASH FLOW HEDGE DERIVATIVES, EXCEPT THE INEFFECTIVE

PORTION, ARE RECORDED IN OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME, UNTIL NET INCOME IS AFFECTED BY THE VARIABILITY OF CASH FLOWS OF THE HEDGED TRANSACTION. IN MOST CASES, AMOUNTS RECORDED IN OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME WILL BE RELEASED TO NET INCOME SOME TIME

AFTER THE MATURITY OF THE RELATED DERIVATIVE. THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF INCOME CLASSIFICATION OF EFFECTIVE HEDGE RESULTS IS THE SAME AS THAT OF THE UNDERLYING EXPOSURE. RESULTS OF HEDGES OF REVENUE AND PRODUCT COSTS ARE RECORDED IN REVENUE AND

COST OF SALES, RESPECTIVELY, WHEN THE UNDERLYING HEDGED

72

TABLE OF CONTENTS

NIKE, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (CONTINUED)

TRANSACTION AFFECTS NET INCOME. RESULTS OF HEDGES OF SELLING AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE ARE RECORDED TOGETHER WITH THOSE COSTS WHEN THE RELATED EXPENSE IS

RECORDED. RESULTS OF HEDGES OF ANTICIPATED PURCHASES AND SALES OF U.S. DOLLAR-DENOMINATED AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE SECURITIES ARE RECORDED IN OTHER (EXPENSE) INCOME, NET WHEN THE SECURITIES ARE SOLD.

RESULTS OF HEDGES OF ANTICIPATED INTERCOMPANY TRANSACTIONS ARE RECORDED IN OTHER (EXPENSE) INCOME, NET WHEN THE TRANSACTION OCCURS. HEDGES OF RECORDED

BALANCE SHEET POSITIONS ARE RECORDED IN OTHER (EXPENSE) INCOME, NET, TOGETHER WITH THE TRANSACTION GAIN OR LOSS FROM THE HEDGED BALANCE SHEET POSITION.

NET FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSACTION GAINS AND LOSSES, WHICH INCLUDE HEDGE RESULTS CAPTURED IN REVENUES, COST OF SALES, SELLING AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE AND OTHER (EXPENSE) INCOME, NET, WERE A $197.3 MILLION LOSS, A

$27.9 MILLION LOSS, AND A $49.9 MILLION GAIN FOR THE YEARS ENDED MAY 31, 2008, 2007, AND 2006, RESPECTIVELY.

PREMIUMS PAID ON OPTIONS

ARE INITIALLY RECORDED AS DEFERRED CHARGES. THE COMPANY ASSESSES THE EFFECTIVENESS OF OPTIONS BASED ON THE TOTAL CASH FLOWS METHOD AND RECORDS TOTAL CHANGES IN THE OPTIONS FAIR VALUE TO OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME TO THE DEGREE THEY ARE

EFFECTIVE.

AS OF MAY 31, 2008, $87.7 MILLION OF DEFERRED NET LOSSES (NET OF TAX) ON BOTH OUTSTANDING AND MATURED DERIVATIVES

ACCUMULATED IN OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME ARE EXPECTED TO BE RECLASSIFIED TO NET INCOME DURING THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS AS A RESULT OF UNDERLYING HEDGED TRANSACTIONS ALSO BEING RECORDED IN NET INCOME. ACTUAL AMOUNTS ULTIMATELY RECLASSIFIED TO NET

INCOME ARE DEPENDENT ON THE EXCHANGE RATES IN EFFECT WHEN DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS THAT ARE CURRENTLY OUTSTANDING MATURE. AS OF MAY 31, 2008, THE MAXIMUM TERM OVER WHICH THE COMPANY IS HEDGING EXPOSURES TO THE VARIABILITY OF CASH FLOWS FOR ITS

FORECASTED AND RECORDED TRANSACTIONS IS 34 MONTHS.

THE COMPANY FORMALLY ASSESSES BOTH AT A HEDGES INCEPTION AND ON AN ONGOING BASIS,

WHETHER THE DERIVATIVES THAT ARE USED IN THE HEDGING TRANSACTION HAVE BEEN HIGHLY EFFECTIVE IN OFFSETTING CHANGES IN THE CASH FLOWS OF HEDGED ITEMS AND WHETHER THOSE DERIVATIVES MAY BE EXPECTED TO REMAIN HIGHLY EFFECTIVE IN FUTURE PERIODS.

EFFECTIVENESS FOR CASH FLOW HEDGES IS ASSESSED BASED ON FORWARD RATES. WHEN IT IS DETERMINED THAT A DERIVATIVE IS NOT, OR HAS CEASED TO BE, HIGHLY EFFECTIVE AS A HEDGE, THE COMPANY DISCONTINUES HEDGE ACCOUNTING PROSPECTIVELY.

THE COMPANY DISCONTINUES HEDGE ACCOUNTING PROSPECTIVELY WHEN (1) IT DETERMINES THAT THE DERIVATIVE IS NO LONGER HIGHLY EFFECTIVE IN OFFSETTING

CHANGES IN THE CASH FLOWS OF A HEDGED ITEM (INCLUDING HEDGED ITEMS SUCH AS FIRM COMMITMENTS OR FORECASTED TRANSACTIONS); (2) THE DERIVATIVE EXPIRES OR IS SOLD, TERMINATED, OR EXERCISED; (3) IT IS NO LONGER PROBABLE THAT THE FORECASTED

TRANSACTION WILL OCCUR; OR (4) MANAGEMENT DETERMINES THAT DESIGNATING THE DERIVATIVE AS A HEDGING INSTRUMENT IS NO LONGER APPROPRIATE.

WHEN THE COMPANY DISCONTINUES HEDGE ACCOUNTING BECAUSE IT IS NO LONGER PROBABLE THAT THE FORECASTED TRANSACTION WILL OCCUR IN THE ORIGINALLY EXPECTED PERIOD, THE GAIN OR LOSS ON THE DERIVATIVE REMAINS IN ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE

INCOME AND IS RECLASSIFIED TO NET INCOME WHEN THE FORECASTED TRANSACTION AFFECTS NET INCOME. HOWEVER, IF IT IS PROBABLE THAT A FORECASTED TRANSACTION WILL NOT OCCUR BY THE END OF THE ORIGINALLY SPECIFIED TIME PERIOD OR WITHIN AN ADDITIONAL TWO-MONTH

PERIOD OF TIME THEREAFTER, THE GAINS AND LOSSES THAT WERE ACCUMULATED IN OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME WILL BE RECOGNIZED IMMEDIATELY IN NET INCOME. IN ALL SITUATIONS IN WHICH HEDGE ACCOUNTING IS DISCONTINUED AND THE DERIVATIVE REMAINS OUTSTANDING, THE

COMPANY WILL CARRY THE DERIVATIVE AT ITS FAIR VALUE ON THE BALANCE SHEET, RECOGNIZING FUTURE CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE IN OTHER (EXPENSE) INCOME, NET. ANY HEDGE INEFFECTIVENESS IS RECORDED IN OTHER (EXPENSE) INCOME, NET.

73

TABLE OF CONTENTS

NIKE, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (CONTINUED)

FOR EACH OF THE YEARS ENDED MAY 31, 2008, 2007 AND 2006, THE COMPANY RECORDED IN OTHER (EXPENSE)

INCOME, NET AN INSIGNIFICANT LOSS REPRESENTING THE TOTAL INEFFECTIVENESS OF ALL CASH FLOW HEDGES. THE DISCONTINUATION OF HEDGE ACCOUNTING FOR ANY OF THE OTHER AFOREMENTIONED REASONS DID NOT MATERIALLY IMPACT NET INCOME FOR EACH OF THE YEARS ENDED

MAY 31, 2008, 2007 AND 2006.

FAIR VALUE HEDGES

THE COMPANY IS ALSO EXPOSED TO THE RISK OF CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF CERTAIN FIXED-RATE DEBT ATTRIBUTABLE TO CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES. DERIVATIVES

CURRENTLY USED BY THE COMPANY TO HEDGE THIS RISK ARE RECEIVE-FIXED, PAY-VARIABLE INTEREST RATE SWAPS.

SUBSTANTIALLY ALL INTEREST RATE SWAP

AGREEMENTS ARE DESIGNATED AS FAIR VALUE HEDGES OF THE RELATED LONG-TERM DEBT AND MEET THE SHORTCUT METHOD REQUIREMENTS UNDER FAS 133. ACCORDINGLY, CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUES OF THE INTEREST RATE SWAP AGREEMENTS ARE EXACTLY OFFSET BY CHANGES IN THE

FAIR VALUE OF THE UNDERLYING LONG-TERM DEBT. NO INEFFECTIVENESS HAS BEEN RECORDED TO NET INCOME RELATED TO INTEREST RATE SWAPS DESIGNATED AS FAIR VALUE HEDGES FOR THE YEARS ENDED MAY 31, 2008, 2007 AND 2006.

AS DISCUSSED IN NOTE 7, DURING THE YEAR ENDED MAY 31, 2004, THE COMPANY ISSUED A $50 MILLION MEDIUM-TERM NOTE MATURING OCTOBER 1, 2013 AND

SIMULTANEOUSLY ENTERED INTO A RECEIVE-FIXED, PAY-VARIABLE INTEREST RATE SWAP WITH THE SAME NOTIONAL AMOUNT AND FIXED INTEREST RATE AS THE NOTE. HOWEVER, THE SWAP EXPIRED OCTOBER 2, 2006. THIS INTEREST RATE SWAP WAS NOT ACCOUNTED FOR AS A FAIR

VALUE HEDGE. ACCORDINGLY, CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE SWAP WERE RECORDED TO NET INCOME EACH PERIOD AS A COMPONENT OF OTHER (EXPENSE) INCOME, NET. THE CHANGE IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE SWAP WAS NOT MATERIAL FOR THE YEARS ENDED MAY 31, 2007

AND 2006.

IN FISCAL 2003, THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO AN INTEREST RATE SWAP AGREEMENT RELATED TO A JAPANESE YEN DENOMINATED INTERCOMPANY LOAN

WITH ONE OF THE COMPANYS JAPANESE SUBSIDIARIES. THE JAPANESE SUBSIDIARY PAYS VARIABLE INTEREST ON THE INTERCOMPANY LOAN BASED ON 3-MONTH LIBOR PLUS A SPREAD. UNDER THE INTEREST RATE SWAP AGREEMENT, THE SUBSIDIARY PAYS FIXED INTEREST PAYMENTS

AT 0.8% AND RECEIVES VARIABLE INTEREST PAYMENTS BASED ON 3-MONTH LIBOR PLUS A SPREAD BASED ON A NOTIONAL AMOUNT OF 8 BILLION JAPANESE YEN. THIS INTEREST RATE SWAP IS NOT ACCOUNTED FOR AS A FAIR VALUE HEDGE. ACCORDINGLY, CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF

THE SWAP ARE RECORDED TO NET INCOME EACH PERIOD AS A COMPONENT OF INTEREST INCOME (EXPENSE), NET. THE CHANGE IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE SWAP WAS NOT MATERIAL FOR THE YEARS ENDED MAY 31, 2008, 2007 AND 2006.

NET INVESTMENT HEDGES

DURING

2008, THE COMPANY BEGAN TO HEDGE THE RISK OF VARIABILITY IN FOREIGN-CURRENCY-DENOMINATED NET INVESTMENTS IN WHOLLY-OWNED INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS. DERIVATIVES USED BY THE COMPANY TO HEDGE THIS FOREIGN CURRENCY EXPOSURE ARE FORWARD EXCHANGE CONTRACTS

AND THE UNDERLYING HEDGED INVESTMENTS ARE DENOMINATED IN EUROS. ALL CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE OF THE DERIVATIVES DESIGNATED AS NET INVESTMENT HEDGES, EXCEPT INEFFECTIVE PORTIONS, ARE REPORTED IN THE CUMULATIVE TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENT COMPONENT OF OTHER

COMPREHENSIVE INCOME ALONG WITH THE FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENTS ON THOSE INVESTMENTS.

THE COMPANY ASSESSES HEDGE

EFFECTIVENESS BASED ON CHANGES IN FORWARD RATES. THE COMPANY RECORDED NO INEFFECTIVENESS FROM ITS NET INVESTMENT HEDGES IN 2008.

AS OF

MAY 31, 2008, $68.6 MILLION OF DEFERRED NET LOSSES ON BOTH OUTSTANDING AND MATURED DERIVATIVES WAS INCLUDED IN THE CUMULATIVE TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENT COMPONENT OF OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME.

CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK

THE COMPANY IS EXPOSED TO CREDIT-RELATED LOSSES IN THE EVENT OF NON-PERFORMANCE BY COUNTERPARTIES TO HEDGING INSTRUMENTS. THE COUNTERPARTIES TO ALL

DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS ARE MAJOR FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS WITH INVESTMENT GRADE CREDIT RATINGS. HOWEVER, THIS DOES NOT ELIMINATE THE COMPANYS EXPOSURE TO CREDIT RISK WITH THESE INSTITUTIONS. THIS CREDIT RISK IS GENERALLY LIMITED TO THE

UNREALIZED GAINS IN SUCH CONTRACTS SHOULD ANY OF THESE COUNTERPARTIES FAIL TO PERFORM AS CONTRACTED. TO MANAGE THIS RISK, THE COMPANY HAS ESTABLISHED STRICT COUNTERPARTY CREDIT GUIDELINES THAT ARE CONTINUALLY MONITORED AND REPORTED TO SENIOR

MANAGEMENT ACCORDING TO PRESCRIBED GUIDELINES. THE COMPANY UTILIZES A PORTFOLIO OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS EITHER HEADQUARTERED OR OPERATING IN THE SAME COUNTRIES THE COMPANY CONDUCTS ITS BUSINESS. AS A RESULT OF THE ABOVE CONSIDERATIONS, THE COMPANY

CONSIDERS THE RISK OF COUNTERPARTY DEFAULT TO BE MINIMAL.

IN ADDITION TO HEDGING INSTRUMENTS, THE COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO CONCENTRATIONS OF

CREDIT RISK ASSOCIATED WITH CASH AND EQUIVALENTS AND ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE. THE COMPANY PLACES CASH AND EQUIVALENTS WITH FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS WITH INVESTMENT GRADE CREDIT RATINGS AND, BY POLICY, LIMITS THE AMOUNT OF CREDIT EXPOSURE TO ANY ONE

FINANCIAL INSTITUTION. THE COMPANY CONSIDERS ITS CONCENTRATION RISK RELATED TO ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE TO BE MITIGATED BY THE COMPANYS CREDIT POLICY, THE LACK OF SIGNIFICANCE OF OUTSTANDING BALANCES OWED BY EACH INDIVIDUAL CUSTOMER AT ANY POINT IN

TIME AND THE GEOGRAPHIC DISPERSION OF THESE CUSTOMERS.

NOTE 17  OPERATING SEGMENTS AND RELATED INFORMATION

OPERATING SEGMENTS.

THE COMPANYS OPERATING SEGMENTS ARE EVIDENCE OF THE STRUCTURE OF THE COMPANYS INTERNAL

ORGANIZATION. THE MAJOR SEGMENTS ARE DEFINED BY GEOGRAPHIC REGIONS FOR OPERATIONS PARTICIPATING IN NIKE BRAND SALES ACTIVITY EXCLUDING NIKE GOLF AND NIKE BAUER HOCKEY. EACH NIKE BRAND GEOGRAPHIC SEGMENT OPERATES PREDOMINANTLY IN ONE INDUSTRY: THE

DESIGN, PRODUCTION, MARKETING AND SELLING OF SPORTS AND FITNESS FOOTWEAR, APPAREL, AND EQUIPMENT. THE OTHER CATEGORY SHOWN BELOW REPRESENTS ACTIVITIES OF COLE HAAN, CONVERSE, EXETER BRANDS GROUP (WHOSE PRIMARY BUSINESS WAS THE STARTER

BRAND BUSINESS WHICH WAS SOLD ON DECEMBER 17, 2007), HURLEY, NIKE BAUER HOCKEY (THROUGH APRIL 16, 2008), NIKE GOLF, AND UMBRO (BEGINNING MARCH 3, 2008) WHICH ARE CONSIDERED IMMATERIAL FOR INDIVIDUAL DISCLOSURE BASED ON THE AGGREGATION

CRITERIA IN SFAS NO. 131 DISCLOSURES ABOUT SEGMENTS OF AN ENTERPRISE AND RELATED INFORMATION.

WHERE APPLICABLE,

CORPORATE REPRESENTS ITEMS NECESSARY TO RECONCILE TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, WHICH GENERALLY INCLUDE CORPORATE ACTIVITY AND CORPORATE ELIMINATIONS.

NET REVENUES AS SHOWN BELOW REPRESENT SALES TO EXTERNAL CUSTOMERS FOR EACH SEGMENT. INTERCOMPANY REVENUES HAVE BEEN ELIMINATED AND ARE IMMATERIAL FOR

SEPARATE DISCLOSURE. THE COMPANY EVALUATES PERFORMANCE OF INDIVIDUAL OPERATING SEGMENTS BASED ON PRE-TAX INCOME. ON A CONSOLIDATED BASIS, THIS AMOUNT REPRESENTS
