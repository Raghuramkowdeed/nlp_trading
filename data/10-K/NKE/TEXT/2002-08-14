business
general
nike, inc. was incorporated in 1968 under the
laws of the state of oregon. as used in this report, the terms
we, us, nike and the
company refer to nike, inc. and its predecessors,
subsidiaries and affiliates, unless the context indicates
otherwise.
our principal business activity involves the
design, development and worldwide marketing of high quality
footwear, apparel, equipment, and accessory products. nike is
the largest seller of athletic footwear and athletic apparel in
the world. we sell our products to approximately
18,000retail accounts in the united states and through a
mix of independent distributors, licensees and subsidiaries in
approximately 140countries around the world. virtually all
of our products are manufactured by independent contractors.
virtually all footwear products are produced outside the united
states, while apparel products are produced both in the united
states and abroad.
products
nikes athletic footwear products are
designed primarily for specific athletic use, although a large
percentage of the products are worn for casual or leisure
purposes. we place considerable emphasis on high quality
construction and innovative design. running, basketball,
childrens, cross-training and womens shoes are
currently our top-selling product categories and we expect them
to continue to lead in product sales in the near future.
however, we also market shoes designed for outdoor activities,
tennis, golf, soccer, baseball, football, bicycling, volleyball,
wrestling, cheerleading, aquatic activities, hiking, and other
athletic and recreational uses.
we sell active sports apparel covering most of
the above categories, athletically inspired lifestyle apparel,
as well as athletic bags and accessory items. nike apparel and
accessories are designed to complement our athletic footwear
products, feature the same trademarks and are sold through the
same marketing and distribution channels. we often market
footwear, apparel and accessories in collections of
similar design or for specific purposes. we also market apparel
with licensed college and professional team and league logos.
we sell a line of performance equipment under the
nike brand name, including sport balls, timepieces, eyewear,
skates, bats, gloves, and other equipment designed for sports
activities. we also have agreements for licensees to produce and
sell nike brand swimwear, womens sports bras, cycling
apparel, childrens clothing, posters, school supplies,
timepieces, and electronic media devices. we also sell small
amounts of various plastic products to other manufacturers
through our wholly-owned subsidiary, nike ihm, inc.
we sell a line of dress and casual footwear and
accessories for men, women and children under the brand name
cole haan through our wholly-owned subsidiary, cole haan
holdings, inc., headquartered in yarmouth, maine.
our wholly-owned subsidiary, bauer nike hockey
inc., headquartered in greenland, new hampshire, manufactures
and distributes ice skates, skate blades, in-line roller skates,
protective gear, hockey sticks, and hockey jerseys and
accessories under the bauer and nike brand names.
bauer also offers a full selection of products for street,
roller and field hockey.
in april 2002, we acquired hurley international
llc, headquartered in costa mesa, california, which designs and
distributes a line of action sports apparel (for surfing,
skateboarding, and snowboarding) and youth lifestyle apparel
under the hurley brand name.

financial information about geographic and
segment operations appears in note16 of the consolidated
financial statements on page51.
we experience moderate fluctuations in aggregate
sales volume during the year. however, the mix of product sales
may vary considerably from time to time as a result of changes
in seasonal and geographic demand for particular types of
footwear, apparel, and equipment.
because nike is a consumer products company, the
relative popularity of various sports and fitness activities and
changing design trends affect the demand for our products. we
must therefore respond to trends and shifts in consumer
preferences by adjusting the mix of existing product offerings,
developing new products, styles and categories, and influencing
sports and fitness preferences through aggressive marketing.
this is a continuing risk. failure to timely and adequately
respond could have a material adverse affect on our sales and
profitability.
table of contents
united states market
during fiscal 2002, sales in the united states
accounted for approximately 53percent of total revenues,
compared to 54percent in fiscal 2001 and 56 percent in
fiscal 2000. we sell to approximately 18,000retail
accounts in the united states. the nike brand domestic retail
account base includes a mix of footwear stores, sporting goods
stores, athletic specialty stores, department stores, skate,
tennis and golf shops, and other retail accounts. during fiscal
year 2002, our three largest customers accounted for
approximately 28percent of nike brand sales in the united
states, and 26percent of total sales in the united states.
we make substantial use of our
futures ordering program, which allows retailers to
order five to six months in advance of delivery with the
guarantee that 90percent of their orders will be delivered
within a set time period at a fixed price. in fiscal year 2002,
92percent of our u.s. footwear shipments (excluding cole
haan, bauer and hurley) were made under the futures program,
compared to 86percent in fiscal 2001 and 90percent
in fiscal 2000. in fiscal 2002, 77percent of our
u.s.apparel shipments were made under the futures program,
compared to 78percent in fiscal 2001, and 82percent
in 2000.
we utilize 18 nike sales offices to solicit sales
in the united states. we also utilize 15independent sales
representatives to sell specialty products for golf, cycling,
water sports and outdoor activities. in addition, we operate the
following retail outlets in the united states:
retail stores
number
nike factory stores (which carry primarily
b-grade and close-out merchandise)
nike stores (including nike goddess stores)
niketowns (designed to showcase nike products)
employee-only stores
cole haan stores (including factory and employee
stores)
total
nikes domestic distribution centers for
footwear are located in beaverton, oregon, wilsonville, oregon,
memphis, tennessee, and greenland, new hampshire. apparel
products are shipped from our memphis distribution center. cole
haan footwear and bauer nike hockey products are distributed
primarily from greenland, new hampshire, and hurley products are
shipped from costa mesa, california.
international markets
we currently market our products in approximately
140 countries outside of the united states through independent
distributors, licensees, subsidiaries and branch offices.
non-u.s. sales accounted for 47percent of total revenues
in fiscal 2002, compared to 46 percent in fiscal 2001 and
44percent in fiscal 2000. we operate 19 distribution
centers in europe, asia, australia, latin america, and canada,
and also distribute through independent distributors and
licensees. we estimate that our products are sold through more
than 30,000 retail accounts outside the united states. in many
countries and regions, including japan, canada, asia, latin
america, and europe, we have a futures ordering program for
retailers similar to the united states futures program described
above. nikes three largest customers outside of the u.s.
accounted for approximately 9 percent of non-u.s. sales.
we operate 162 retail outlets outside the united
states, which are comprised of niketowns, factory stores,
employee stores, and cole haan stores.
international branch offices and subsidiaries of
nike are located in argentina, australia, austria, belgium,
brazil, canada, chile, croatia, czech republic, denmark,
finland, france, germany, hong kong, hungary, indonesia, india,
ireland, israel, italy, japan, korea, malaysia, mexico, new
zealand, the netherlands, norway, peoples republic of china, the
philippines, poland, portugal, singapore, slovakia, slovenia,
south africa, spain, sweden, switzerland, taiwan, thailand,
turkey, the united kingdom, and vietnam.
table of contents
significant customers
foot locker, inc., which operates a chain of
retail stores specializing in athletic footwear and apparel,
accounted for approximately 11 percent of global net sales of
nike brand products during fiscal 2002. no other customer
accounted for 10 percent or more of our net sales during fiscal
2002.
orders
as of may31, 2002, our worldwide futures
orders for nike brand athletic footwear and apparel totaled
$4.6billion, compared to $4.4billion as of
may31, 2001. these orders are scheduled for delivery from
june through november of 2002. based upon historical data, we
expect that approximately 95 percent of these orders will be
filled in that time period, although the orders may be
cancelable.
product research and development
we believe that our research and development
efforts are a key factor in our past and future success.
technical innovation in the design of footwear, apparel, and
athletic equipment receive continued emphasis as nike strives to
produce products that reduce or eliminate injury, aid athletic
performance and maximize comfort.
in addition to nikes own staff of
specialists in the areas of biomechanics, exercise physiology,
engineering, industrial design and related fields, we also
utilize research committees and advisory boards made up of
athletes, coaches, trainers, equipment managers, orthopedists,
podiatrists and other experts who consult with us and review
designs, materials and concepts for product improvement.
employee athletes wear-test and evaluate products during the
design and development process.
manufacturing
in fiscal 2002, approximately 5 percent of total
nike brand apparel production for sale to the united states
market was manufactured in the united states by independent
contract manufacturers, most of which are located in the
southern states. the remainder was manufactured by independent
contractors located in 28 countries. most of this apparel
production occurred in bangladesh, bulgaria, china, hong kong,
india, indonesia, malaysia, mexico, pakistan, the philippines,
sri lanka, taiwan, thailand, and turkey. substantially all of
our apparel production for sale to the international market was
manufactured outside the u.s. our largest single apparel
supplier accounted for approximately 8 percent of total fiscal
2002 apparel production.
virtually all of our footwear is produced outside
of the united states. in fiscal 2002, contract suppliers in the
following countries manufactured the following percentages of
total nike brand footwear:
country
percent
peoples republic of china
indonesia
vietnam
thailand
italy
taiwan
south korea
we also have manufacturing agreements with
independent factories in argentina, brazil, india, mexico, south
africa, and zimbabwe, to manufacture footwear for sale within
those countries. our largest single footwear supplier accounted
for approximately 6 percent of total fiscal 2002 footwear
production.
the principal materials used in our footwear
products are natural and synthetic rubber, plastic compounds,
foam cushioning materials, nylon, leather, canvas, and
polyurethane films used to make air-sole cushioning components.
nike ihm, inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of nike, is our sole
supplier of the air-sole cushioning components used in footwear.
the principal materials used in our
table of contents
apparel products are natural and synthetic
fabrics and threads, plastic and metal hardware, and specialized
performance fabrics designed to repel rain, retain heat, or
efficiently transport body moisture. nike and its contractors
and suppliers buy raw materials in bulk. most raw materials are
available in the countries where manufacturing takes place. we
have thus far experienced little difficulty in satisfying our
raw material requirements.
our international operations are subject to the
usual risks of doing business abroad, such as possible
revaluation of currencies, export duties, quotas, restrictions
on the transfer of funds and, in certain parts of the world,
political instability. see trade legislation below.
we have not, to date, been materially affected by any such risk,
but cannot predict the likelihood of such developments
occurring. we believe that we have the ability to develop, over
a period of time, adequate alternative sources of supply for the
products obtained from our present suppliers outside of the
united states. if events prevented us from acquiring products
from our suppliers in a particular country, our footwear
operations could be temporarily disrupted and we could
experience an adverse financial impact. however, we believe that
we could eliminate any such disruption within a period of no
more than 12months, and that any adverse impact would,
therefore, be of a short-term nature. we believe that our
principal competitors are subject to similar risks.
all of our products manufactured overseas and
imported into the united states and other countries are subject
to customs duties collected by customs authorities. customs
information submitted by us is routinely subject to review by
customs authorities. we are unable to predict whether additional
customs duties, quotas or other restrictions may be imposed on
the importation of our products in the future. the enactment of
any such duties, quotas or restrictions could result in
increases in the cost of our products generally and might
adversely affect the sales or profitability of nike and the
imported footwear and apparel industry as a whole.
since 1972, nissho iwai american corporation
(niac), a subsidiary of nissho iwai corporation, a
large japanese trading company, has performed significant
import-export financing services for us. currently, niac
provides such financing services with respect to at least 80
percent of the nike products sold outside of the united states,
europe and japan. any failure of niac to provide these services
could disrupt our ability to acquire products from our suppliers
and to deliver products to our customers outside of the united
states, europe and japan. such a disruption could result in
cancelled orders that would adversely affect sales and
profitability. however, we believe that any such disruption
would be short term in duration due to the ready availability of
alternative sources of financing at competitive rates. our
current agreements with niac expire on may31, 2003.
trade legislation
our non-u.s. operations are subject to the usual
risks of doing business abroad, such as the imposition of import
quotas or anti-dumping duties. in 1994, the european union
(eu) commission imposed quotas on certain types of
footwear manufactured in china. these quotas replaced national
quotas that had previously been in effect in several member
states. footwear designed for use in sporting activities,
meeting certain technical criteria and having a cif (cost,
insurance and freight) price above 9 euros (special
technology athletic footwear or staf), is
excluded from the quotas. as a result of the staf exclusion, and
the amount of quota made available to us, the quotas have not,
to date, had a material effect on our business.
in 1995, the eu commission, at the request of
european footwear manufacturers, initiated two anti-dumping
investigations covering footwear imported from the peoples
republic of china, indonesia and thailand. as a result, in 1997
the commission imposed definitive anti-dumping duties on certain
textile upper footwear imported from china and indonesia. in
1998, the commission imposed definitive anti-dumping duties on
certain synthetic and leather upper footwear originating in
china, indonesia and thailand. in the case of textile upper
footwear, the anti-dumping duties do not cover sports footwear.
in the case of synthetic and leather upper footwear, the
anti-dumping duties do not cover footwear meeting the staf
technical criteria nor footwear with a cif price above 5.7
euros. as the anti-dumping duties for synthetic and leather
uppers only affect some low cost footwear, these measures have
no impact for us. while the exclusions are subject to some
interpretation by customs authorities, we believe that most of
our footwear sourced in the target countries for sale in the eu
fits within the exclusions. we have also shifted the production
of these types
table of contents
of footwear to other countries. accordingly, the
anti-dumping duties have not had a material effect on our
business. the eu commission has announced the impending
expiration of these anti-dumping cases, subject to possible
review requests by the european footwear manufacturers. such
reviews may result in the renewal of the anti-dumping
regulations.
the eu commission in june 2000 issued an
amendment to the explanatory notes to the eus customs
nomenclature (cn). the amendment, which is not
legally binding, interprets some of the technical criteria for
the staf exclusion and the footwear types that can be classified
as for use in sporting activity. the amendment restricts
somewhat the scope of the staf exclusion from the quotas and
also the sports footwear exclusions from the two eu anti-dumping
measures. to date, the large majority of our footwear models
fall within the exclusions provided for under the cn. our
innovative footwear designs may stretch the traditional concepts
of athletic or sports footwear reflected in the technical
criteria. we anticipate that the majority of these new designs
will fall within the exclusions. nike is an active participant
in discussions to revise the technical criteria to reflect
technologically advanced designs.
if the eu trade measures become substantially
more restrictive we would consider shifting the production of
such footwear to other countries in order to maintain
competitive pricing. we believe that we are prepared to deal
effectively with any such change of circumstances and that any
adverse impact would be of a temporary nature. we continue to
closely monitor international restrictions and maintain our
multi-country sourcing strategy and contingency plans. we
believe that our major competitors stand in much the same
position regarding these trade measures.
we currently source footwear and apparel products
from factories in vietnam. in july 2000, the united states and
vietnam signed an historic, comprehensive bilateral trade
agreement, which, among other things, provides reciprocal,
non-discriminatory normal trade relations (ntr)
between the two countries. in september 2001, that agreement was
approved by congress and then ratified by the vietnamese
national assembly. once approved, the united states granted an
annual extension of ntr to vietnam. under current u.s. law, the
president must renew this grant annually with the opportunity
for review by the congress. in june 2002, president bush renewed
ntr for vietnam for an additional year and in july 2002, the
congress supported the presidents decision. we currently
believe that, absent unforeseen circumstances, the president
will continue his annual extensions of ntr to vietnam and that
congress will support the presidents decisions. ongoing
ntr trading status for vietnam will allow us to expand our
production and marketing opportunities in vietnam and allow for
vietnamese-sourced product to enter the united states at ntr
tariff rates.
competition
the athletic footwear, apparel and equipment
industry is keenly competitive in the united states and on a
worldwide basis. we compete internationally with an increasing
number of athletic and leisure shoe companies, athletic and
leisure apparel companies, sports equipment companies, and large
companies having diversified lines of athletic and leisure
shoes, apparel and equipment, including reebok, adidas and
others. the intense competition and the rapid changes in
technology and consumer preferences in the markets for athletic
and leisure footwear and apparel, and athletic equipment,
constitute significant risk factors in our operations.
nike is the largest seller of athletic footwear
and athletic apparel in the world. performance and reliability
of shoes, apparel, and equipment, new product development,
price, product identity through marketing and promotion, and
customer support and service are important aspects of
competition in the athletic footwear, apparel and equipment
industry. to help market our products, we contract with
prominent and influential athletes, coaches, teams, colleges,
and sports leagues to endorse our brands and use our products,
and we actively sponsor sporting events and clinics. we believe
that we are competitive in all of these areas.
table of contents
trademarks and patents
we utilize trademarks on nearly all of our
products and believe that having distinctive marks that are
readily identifiable is an important factor in creating a market
for our goods, in identifying the company, and in distinguishing
our goods from the goods of others. we consider our nike
and swoosh design trademarks to be among our most valuable
assets and we have registered these trademarks in over
100countries. in addition, we own many other trademarks
which we utilize in marketing our products. we continue to
vigorously protect our trademarks against infringement.
nike has an exclusive, worldwide license to make
and sell footwear using patented air technology. the
process utilizes pressurized gas encapsulated in polyurethane.
some of the early nikeair patents have expired,
which may enable competitors to use certain types of like
technology. subsequent nikeair patents will not expire for
several years. we also have a number of patents covering
components and features used in various athletic and leisure
shoes. we believe that our success depends primarily upon skills
in design, research and development, production and marketing
rather than upon our patent position. however, we have followed
a policy of filing applications for united states and foreign
patents on inventions, designs and improvements that we deem
valuable.
employees
we had approximately 22,700employees at
may31, 2002. management considers its relationship with
employees to be excellent. with the exception of bauer nike
hockey inc., our employees are not represented by a union. of
bauer nike hockeys north american employees, approximately
65percent, or fewer than 450, are covered by three union
collective bargaining agreements with three separate bargaining
units, and all of bauer nike hockeys approximately 150
non-immigrant employees in italy are covered by three collective
bargaining agreements. the collective bargaining agreements
expire on various dates from 2002 through 2003. there has never
been a material interruption of operations due to labor
disagreements.

july25, 2002 are as follows:
philip h. knight,

item3.legal
proceedings
except as described below, there are no material
pending legal proceedings, other than ordinary routine
litigation incidental to our business, to which we are a party
or of which any of our property is the subject.
the company and certain of its officers and
directors were named as defendants in four substantially
identical securities class actions filed in the u.s. district
court for the district of oregon on march9, 14, 20, and
april4, 2001. on july23, 2001, the cases were
consolidated as in re nike, inc. securities litigation,
cv-01-332-k. the consolidated amended complaint sought
unspecified damages on behalf of a purported class consisting of
purchasers of the companys stock during the period
december20, 2000 through february26, 2001.
plaintiffs allege that the defendants made false and misleading
statements about the companys actual and expected business
and financial performance in violation of federal securities
laws. plaintiffs further allege that certain individual
defendants sold company stock while in possession of material
non-public information. in january2002, the court
dismissed this action with leave to amend. on february25,
2002, plaintiffs filed an amended complaint extending the
purported class period to june29, 2000 through
february26, 2001 and containing the same allegations.
based on the available information we do not currently
anticipate that the action will have a material financial
impact. we believe the claims are without merit, and we intend
to vigorously defend against them.
a related shareholder derivative lawsuit,
metivier v. denunzio, et al., 0104-04339, was filed in the
multnomah county circuit court of the state of oregon on
april26, 2001. the state derivative suit was brought by
certain company shareholders, allegedly on behalf of the
company, against certain directors and officers of the company.
the derivative plaintiffs allege that these officers and
directors breached their
table of contents
fiduciary duties to the company by making or
causing to be made alleged misstatements about the
companys actual and expected financial performance while
certain officers and directors sold company stock and by
allowing the company to be sued in the shareholder class action.
the derivative plaintiffs seek compensatory and other damages,
and disgorgement of compensation received. on july25,
2001, the court entered a stipulation and order abating the
action until further notice.
another related shareholder derivative lawsuit,
lendman v. knight, etal., cv-01-1153-as, was filed in the
u.s. district court for the district of oregon on july26,
2001. the federal derivative suit is not materially different
from the state derivative action. it alleges substantially
similar causes of action and seeks substantially similar
remedies. the federal derivative action was served on the
company and the individual defendants on december13, 2001
and was also stayed pending the outcome of in re nike, inc.
securities litigation on december13, 2001.
in accordance with the companys articles of
incorporation and bylaws, and in accordance with indemnity
agreements between the company and the directors and officers
named in the above legal actions, the company has agreed to
indemnify these individuals and assume their defense in the
actions.
the company and certain of its officers were
named as defendants in an lawsuit, kasky v. nike, inc. et al.,
no.994446, filed in 1998 in san francisco county superior
court. plaintiff brought the action under the california
business and professions code alleging that statements made by
the company in response to criticism about labor practices in
factories making its products were false or misleading.
plaintiff seeks injunctive relief and restitution of profits
earned from the alleged violations of the california code. the
claims were dismissed by the superior court, with the court
concluding that the alleged statements, if made, were protected
speech as part of a public debate under the first amendment to
the united states constitution. plaintiff appealed the superior
court ruling to the california court of appeals, which court
affirmed the ruling of the lower court. plaintiff sought review
in the california supreme court, which, on may2, 2002,
overturned the lower court rulings by a four to three vote. the
california supreme court made no ruling on the merits of
plaintiffs contention that the company had made false or
misleading statements, but concluded that the alleged statements
were commercial speech and not entitled to the full protection
of the first amendment of the united states constitution. the
company filed a petition for rehearing before the california
supreme court, which was denied on july31, 2002. the case
has been remanded to the lower california state courts for
further proceedings. we have announced our intention to seek
review by the united states supreme court and have engaged
additional counsel for that specific purpose. since the
litigation is in a preliminary stage, we do not currently
anticipate that the action will have a material financial
impact. we believe that the claims are without merit and we
intend to vigorously defend against them.

discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of
operations
critical accounting policies
our discussion and analysis of our financial
condition and results of operations following are based upon our
consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in
accordance with accounting principles
table of contents
generally accepted in the united states. the
preparation of these financial statements requires us to make
estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of
assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities.
we believe that the estimates, assumptions and
judgments involved in the accounting policies described below
have the greatest potential impact on our financial statements,
so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies.
because of the uncertainty inherent in these matters, actual
results could differ from the estimates we use in applying the
critical accounting policies. certain of these critical
accounting policies affect working capital account balances,
including the policies for revenue recognition, the reserve for
uncollectible accounts receivable, inventory reserves, and
contingent payments under endorsement contracts. these policies
require that we make estimates in the preparation of our
financial statements as of a given date. however, since our
business cycle is relatively short, actual results related to
these estimates are generally known within the six-month period
following the financial statement date. thus, these policies
generally affect only the timing of reported amounts across two
to three quarters.
within the context of these critical accounting
policies, we are not currently aware of any reasonably likely
events or circumstances which would result in materially
different amounts being reported.
revenue recognition
we record wholesale revenues when title passes
and the risks and rewards of ownership have passed to the
customer, based on the terms of sale. title passes generally
upon shipment or upon receipt by the customer depending on the
country of the sale and the agreement with the customer. retail
store revenues are recorded at the time of sale.
in some instances, we ship product directly from
our supplier to the customer. in these cases, we recognize
revenue when the product is delivered to the customer. our
revenues may fluctuate in cases when our customers delay
accepting shipment of product for periods up to several weeks.
in certain countries outside of the u.s., precise
information regarding the date of receipt by the customer is not
readily available. in these cases, we estimate the date of
receipt by the customer based upon historical delivery times by
geographic location. on the basis of our tests of actual
transactions, we have no indication that these estimates have
been materially inaccurate historically.
as part of our revenue recognition policy, we
record estimated sales returns and miscellaneous claims from
customers as reductions to revenues at the time revenues are
recorded. we base our estimates on historical rates of product
returns and claims, and specific identification of outstanding
claims and outstanding returns not yet received from customers.
in the past, actual returns and claims have not exceeded our
reserves. however, actual returns and claims in any future
period are inherently uncertain and thus may differ from our
estimates. if actual or expected future returns and claims were
significantly greater or lower than the reserves we had
established, we would record a reduction or increase to net
revenues in the period in which we made such determination.
reserve for uncollectible accounts
receivable
we make ongoing estimates relating to the
collectibility of our accounts receivable and maintain a reserve
for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our
customers to make required payments. in determining the amount
of the reserve, we consider our historical level of credit
losses and make judgments about the creditworthiness of
significant customers based on ongoing credit evaluations.
historically, losses from uncollectible accounts have not
exceeded our reserves. since we cannot predict future changes in
the financial stability of our customers, actual future losses
from uncollectible accounts may differ from our estimates. if
the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate,
resulting in their inability to make payments, a larger reserve
might be required. in the event we determined that a smaller or
larger reserve was appropriate, we would record a credit or a
charge to selling and administrative expense in the period in
which we made such a determination.
table of contents
inventory reserves
we also make ongoing estimates relating to the
market value of inventories, based upon our assumptions about
future demand and market conditions. if we estimate that the net
realizable value of our inventory is less than the cost of the
inventory recorded on our books, we record a reserve equal to
the difference between the cost of the inventory and the
estimated market value. this reserve is recorded as a charge to
cost of sales. if changes in market conditions result in
reductions in the estimated market value of our inventory below
our previous estimate, we would increase our reserve in the
period in which we made such a determination and record a charge
to cost of sales.
contingent payments under endorsement
contracts
a significant portion of our demand creation
(advertising and promotion) expense relates to payments under
endorsement contracts. in general, endorsement payments are
expensed uniformly over the term of the contract. however,
certain contract elements may be accounted for differently,
based upon the facts and circumstances of each individual
contract.
certain contracts provide for contingent payments
to endorsers based upon specific achievements in their sports
(e.g. winning a championship). we record selling and
administrative expense for these amounts when the endorser
achieves the specific goal.
certain contracts provide for payments based upon
endorsers maintaining a level of performance in their sport over
an extended period of time (e.g. maintaining a top ranking in a
sport for a year). these amounts are reported in selling and
administrative expense when we determine that it is probable
that the specified level of performance will be maintained
throughout the period. in these instances, to the extent that
actual payments to the endorser differ from our estimate due to
changes in the endorsers athletic performance, increased
or decreased selling and administrative expense may be reported
in a future period.
certain contracts provide for royalty payments to
endorsers based upon a predetermined percentage of sales of
particular products. we expense these payments in cost of sales
as the related sales are made. in certain contracts, we offer
minimum guaranteed royalty payments. for contractual obligations
for which we estimate that we will not meet the minimum
guaranteed amount of royalty fees through sales of product, we
record in selling and administrative expense the minimum
guaranteed payment amount uniformly over the remaining royalty
term.
property, plant and equipment and other
long-lived assets
property, plant and equipment, including
buildings, equipment, and computer hardware and software is
recorded at cost (including, in some cases, the cost of internal
labor) and is depreciated over its estimated useful life.
changes in circumstances (such as technological advances or
changes to our business operations) can result in differences
between the actual and estimated useful lives. in those cases
where we determine that the useful life of a long-lived asset
should be shortened, we increase depreciation expense over the
remaining useful life to depreciate the assets net book
value to its salvage value.
under current accounting standards, when events
or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a
long-lived asset may be impaired, we estimate the future
undiscounted cash flows to be derived from the asset to
determine whether or not a potential impairment exists. if the
carrying value exceeds our estimate of future undiscounted cash
flows, we then calculate the impairment as the excess of the
carrying value of the asset over our estimate of its fair market
value. any impairment charges are recorded as other expense. we
estimate future undiscounted cash flows using assumptions about
our expected future operating performance. our estimates of
undiscounted cash flows may differ from actual cash flows due
to, among other things, technological changes, economic
conditions, or changes to our business operations. for fiscal
2002, no significant impairment related to the carrying value of
our long-lived assets (including property, plant, and equipment,
goodwill, and other intangible assets) has been recorded under
current accounting standards. however, as of june1, 2002,
we will adopt statement of financial accounting standards (sfas)
no.142, goodwill and other intangible assets.
we expect to record an impairment charge related to the goodwill
table of contents
and other intangible assets of our subsidiaries
bauer nike hockey, inc. and cole-haan holdings, inc. in the
first quarter of fiscal 2003. see recently issued
accounting standards below.
hedge accounting for derivatives
we use forward exchange contracts and option
contracts to hedge certain anticipated foreign currency exchange
transactions, as well as any resulting receivable or payable
balance. when specific criteria required by sfas no.133,
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging
activities, have been met, changes in fair values of hedge
contracts relating to anticipated transactions are recorded in
other comprehensive income rather than current earnings until
the underlying hedged transaction affects current earnings. in
most cases, this results in gains and losses on hedge
derivatives being released from other comprehensive income into
current earnings some time after the maturity of the derivative.
one of the criteria for this accounting treatment is that the
forward exchange contract amount should not be in excess of
specifically identified anticipated transactions. by their very
nature, our estimates of anticipated transactions may fluctuate
over time and may ultimately vary from actual transactions. when
anticipated transaction estimates or actual transaction amounts
decrease below hedged levels, or when the timing of transactions
changes significantly, we are required to reclassify at least a
portion of the cumulative changes in fair values of the related
hedge contracts from other comprehensive income to other income/
expense during the quarter in which such changes occur. once an
anticipated transaction estimate or actual transaction amount
decreases below hedged levels, we make adjustments to the
related hedge contract in order to reduce the amount of the
hedge contract to that of the revised anticipated transaction.
taxes
we record valuation allowances against our
deferred tax assets, when necessary, in accordance with sfas
no.109, accounting for income taxes.
realization of deferred tax assets (such as net operating loss
carryforwards) is dependent on future taxable earnings and is
therefore uncertain. at least quarterly, we assess the
likelihood that our deferred tax asset balance will be recovered
from future taxable income. to the extent we believe that
recovery is not likely, we establish a valuation allowance
against our deferred tax asset, increasing our income tax
expense in the period such determination is made.
in addition, we have not recorded u.s. income tax
expense for foreign earnings that we have declared as
indefinitely reinvested offshore, thus reducing our overall
income tax expense. the amount of earnings designated as
indefinitely reinvested offshore is based upon the actual
deployment of such earnings in our offshore assets and our
expectations of the future cash needs of our u.s. and foreign
entities. income tax considerations are also a factor in
determining the amount of foreign earnings to be repatriated.
in the event actual cash needs of our u.s.
entities exceed our current expectations or the actual cash
needs of our foreign entities are less than expected, we may
need to repatriate foreign earnings which have been designated
as indefinitely reinvested offshore. this would result in
additional income tax expense being recorded.
we take a conservative approach in determining
the amount of foreign earnings to declare as reinvested
offshore. as required by u.s. generally accepted accounting
principles, the presumption is that such earnings will be
repatriated in the future. in order to overcome this
presumption, we carefully review all factors which drive the
ultimate disposition of such foreign earnings, and apply
stringent standards to overcoming the presumption of
repatriation. despite this conservative approach, because the
determination involves our future plans and expectations of
future events, there is a possibility that amounts declared as
indefinitely reinvested offshore may ultimately be repatriated.
conversely, this conservative approach may result in accumulated
foreign earnings (for which u.s. income taxes have been
provided) being determined in the future to be indefinitely
reinvested offshore. in this latter case, our income tax expense
would be reduced in the year of such determination.
on an interim basis, we estimate what our
effective tax rate will be for the full fiscal year and record a
quarterly income tax provision in accordance with the
anticipated annual rate. as the fiscal year progresses, we
continually refine our estimate based upon actual events and
earnings by jurisdiction during the year. this
table of contents
continual estimation process periodically results
in a change to our expected effective tax rate for the fiscal
year. when this occurs, we adjust the income tax provision
during the quarter in which the change in estimate occurs so
that the year-to-date provision equals the expected annual rate.
other contingencies
in the ordinary course of business, we are
involved in legal proceedings involving contractual and
employment relationships, product liability claims, trademark
rights, and a variety of other matters. we record contingent
liabilities resulting from claims against us when it is probable
that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss is
reasonably estimable. we disclose contingent liabilities when
there is a reasonable possibility that the ultimate loss will
exceed the recorded liability. estimating probable losses
requires analysis of multiple factors, in some cases including
judgments about the potential actions of third party claimants
and courts. therefore, actual losses in any future period are
inherently uncertain. currently, we do not believe that any of
our pending legal proceedings or claims will have a material
impact on our financial position or results of operations.
however, if actual or estimated probable future losses exceed
our recorded liability for such claims, we would record
additional charges as other expense during the period in which
the actual loss or change in estimate occurred.
results of operations
fiscal 2002 highlights
revenues increased 4.3% to $9.9billion,
compared to $9.5billion in fiscal 2001.
income before the cumulative effect of an
accounting change increased to $668.3million from
$589.7million in the prior year, an increase of 13.3%.
after the effect of the accounting change, net income rose 12.5%.
diluted earnings per share before the effect of
the accounting change increased by 13.9%, from $2.16 to $2.46.
after the effect of the accounting change, diluted earnings per
share rose 13.0%.
gross margins increased as a percentage of
revenues to 39.3% from 39.0% in fiscal 2001.
selling and administrative expenses increased as
a percentage of revenues to 28.5% from 28.3% in fiscal 2001.
fiscal 2002 compared to fiscal
net income increased 13.3% over fiscal 2001, from
$589.7million to $668.3million (excluding an
after-tax loss of $5.0million related to the cumulative
effect of the adoption of sfas no.133, accounting
for derivative instruments and hedging activities).
diluted earnings per share before the effect of the accounting
change improved 13.9%, from $2.16 to $2.46. these increases
reflected a 10.4% increase in income before income taxes and a
1.7point decrease in our effective income tax rate. the
increase in income before income taxes was due to increased
revenues, improved gross margins and lower interest and other
expenses, partially offset by a slight increase in selling and
administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues.
fiscal 2002 revenues were the highest in our
history, reflecting increased nike brand sales in all of our
geographic regions. in the u.s., nike brand revenues increased
2.0% for the fiscal year, driven by increased sales of apparel
and equipment. the increased sales in apparel reflected higher
demand for in-line products, particularly for nike brand and
brand jordan basketball apparel, more than offsetting the effect
of the expiration of our apparel license agreement with the
national football league last year. in equipment, our rapidly
growing golf business drove a 21.7% increase for the year.
u.s. footwear revenues declined 0.7% versus
fiscal 2001. while in-line sales of footwear increased compared
to last year, particularly in the mid-range price segment,
close-out sales decreased significantly. the reduction in
close-out sales reflected both our efforts to limit the
availability of close-out products in the marketplace (in order
to build overall profitability) and relatively high levels of
close-out sales in the last half of fiscal 2001 due to supply
chain system disruptions discussed further below in the
fiscal 2001 compared to
table of contents
fiscal 2000 section.
as in the apparel business, sales of nike brand and brand jordan
basketball footwear products were the primary drivers of
increased wholesale sales of in-line footwear during the year.
in fiscal 2002, nike brand revenues from our
international regions continued to grow versus the prior year,
both as a percentage of total company revenues and in total
dollars. these revenues represented 45.6% of total company
revenues as compared to 44.6% in fiscal 2001. revenues from our
international regions were $4.5billion as compared to
$4.2billion in fiscal 2001, a 6.6% increase. had the u.s.
dollar remained constant with the prior year, these
international revenues would have increased 12.4%, and
consolidated revenues would have increased 6.9% (compared to
4.3% growth as reported).
increased revenues in each of our international
regions resulted from higher demand for products in all nike
brand businesses: footwear, apparel, and equipment. revenues in
our europe, middle east, and africa (emea) region increased for
the eighth consecutive year. fiscal 2002 reported revenues in
emea increased by 5.7% over fiscal 2001, a 9.6% increase in
constant dollars. in our asia pacific region, reported revenues
grew 9.2%, a 19.3% increase in constant dollars. the americas
region grew reported revenues 5.4%, an 11.9% increase in
constant dollars, despite a drop-off in sales in argentina
during the second half of the year due to that countrys
economic crisis.
in fiscal 2002, other revenue, which primarily
includes revenues from bauer nike hockey, cole haan, and hurley,
increased 6.8% to $465.7million.
foot locker, inc. is our largest single customer
and represented 10.9% of our worldwide revenues in fiscal 2002.
foot locker has expressed its intention to reduce the emphasis
of its u.s. business on higher-priced, premium footwear and
place more focus on moderately-priced offerings. due to this
change in strategy, foot lockers futures orders in the
u.s. for the holiday season (scheduled for delivery from
september through november 2002) decreased significantly versus
the same period in the previous year. in spite of the reduction
in orders from foot locker, total u.s.futures orders for
the september to november period are down only 2.3% versus the
prior year and worldwide futures orders for the same period
increased 3.0% versus fiscal 2002.
the impact of lower orders from foot locker for
the september to november period was largely included in the
june to november futures orders reported in our june27,
2002 press release. however, additional changes in november
orders from foot locker reduced the overall growth of worldwide
futures for the six-month period by approximately 30basis
points to 6.3%.
although we expect foot locker to continue to be
an important retail partner for nike, second half u.s. footwear
orders from this customer will likely be significantly below the
prior year. we are aggressively pursuing incremental sales
across our business as we work to offset these declines and
achieve our worldwide revenue growth goals for the year. we
believe there continues to be strong consumer demand for
high-end, performance footwear; this segment has always been
central to the success of the nike brand. therefore, we will
continue to work aggressively with those retailers who are
focused on serving this market. while the success of these
efforts over the next few quarters is uncertain, we remain
confident in the long-term strength of our brand and our
business.
worldwide futures (advance) orders for nike brand
athletic footwear and apparel scheduled for delivery from june
through november 2002 were 6.3% higher than such orders booked
in the comparable period of fiscal 2002. the percentage growth
in futures orders is not necessarily indicative of our
expectation of revenue growth in subsequent periods. this is
because the mix of orders can shift between advance/futures and
at-once orders. in addition, exchange rate fluctuations as well
as differing levels of order cancellations can cause differences
in the comparisons between future orders and actual revenues.
finally, a significant portion of our revenues are not derived
from futures orders, including wholesale sales of equipment,
u.s. licensed team apparel, bauer nike hockey, cole haan,
hurley, and retail sales across all brands. in the first quarter
of fiscal 2003, we expect that revenue growth will lag futures
order growth, reflecting lower close-out sales versus the first
quarter of fiscal 2002 and lower retail sales versus the same
period last year as u.s. retail sales have remained at
relatively low levels since the terrorist attacks of
september11, 2001.

our gross margin percentage improved 30 basis
points, from 39.0% in fiscal 2001 to 39.3% in fiscal 2002.
factors contributing to the improved gross margin percentage
versus the prior year were as follows:
(1)
higher in-line pricing margins in emea, due to
the effect of higher prices effective at the beginning of the
fiscal year and sourcing and warehousing efficiencies, partially
offset by the effect of weaker euro/u.s.dollar currency
hedge rates relative to fiscal 2001.
(2)
higher footwear margins in the u.s. due in part
to lower product costs and lower transportation costs, as a
result of both effective negotiations with shippers and lower
air freight costs incurred. relatively higher air freight costs
were incurred in fiscal 2001 due to supply chain problems
discussed following.
(3)
a higher mix of in-line sales versus close-out
sales of u.s.footwear, reflecting increased demand for
in-line footwear and lower close-out sales as compared to fiscal
2001 as discussed above.
selling and administrative expenses increased as
a percentage of revenues from 28.3% in fiscal 2001 to 28.5% in
fiscal 2002. operating overhead increased 6.0% during fiscal
2002 largely as a result of our continued investment in
initiatives intended to generate future revenues and profits.
significant drivers of the increased operating overhead included
increased investment in our supply chain initiative, additional
headcount to support our growing golf and european businesses,
additional expense for compensation programs tied to our
table of contents
profitability and stock performance, and costs
for additional retail stores primarily in our emea and asia
pacific regions.
the supply chain initiative refers to our
on-going development of systems and processes supporting our
worldwide supply chain. this initiative is intended to improve
revenue (by increasing our ability to respond to market
conditions), margins (by lowering close-outs and distribution
costs) and cash flow (by reducing inventories). the ultimate
level of benefit to revenues, margins, and cash flows, if any,
will not be known until the new systems and processes have been
implemented worldwide over the next few years. during fiscal
2002, we implemented new systems and processes for certain
global functions and for our u.s.business, and we plan on
implementing new systems and processes in emea during fiscal
2003. in fiscal 2003, we will continue to invest in the
implementation of the new systems worldwide and support our
existing system infrastructure for those businesses where we
have not yet implemented the new systems.
demand creation expense was $1,027.9million
in fiscal 2002 versus $998.2million in fiscal 2001, which
was consistent between years as a percentage of revenues. our
fiscal 2002 demand creation expense reflected incremental
spending for our world cup 2002 marketing campaign, which
occurred primarily in our international regions. in fiscal 2003,
we expect demand creation expense to grow slightly faster than
revenues, reflecting the continuation of the world cup 2002
campaign into the first quarter of fiscal 2003. in addition, we
have entered into a long-term license and endorsement agreement
with manchester united, one of the premier soccer clubs in the
world, which begins in august 2002. payments under this contract
will result in additional demand creation expense.
interest expense decreased 18.9%, from
$58.7million to $47.6million in fiscal 2002, due to
lower interest rates in the current year and lower average debt
levels, as we used operating free cash flow to reduce debt.
other income/ expense was a net expense of
$3.0million versus a net expense of $34.1million in
fiscal 2001. consistent with previous years, other
income/expense included interest income, profit sharing expense,
goodwill amortization, certain foreign currency conversion gains
and losses, and asset disposal gains/ losses. net other expense
decreased between years as the fiscal 2001 amount included
charges for contractual settlements that did not recur in fiscal
2002. in addition, fiscal 2002 other income/ expense included
credits related to the favorable resolution of some outstanding
claims.
our fiscal 2002 effective tax rate was 34.3% as
compared to 36.0% in fiscal 2001. as required by
u.s.generally accepted accounting principles, we do not
accrue for u.s.tax liability on foreign earnings
permanently invested offshore. the lower effective tax rate in
fiscal 2002 is primarily the result of a larger amount of
foreign earnings permanently invested offshore in fiscal 2002
than in fiscal 2001.
fiscal 2001 compared to fiscal
net income increased 1.8% over fiscal 2000, from
$579.1million to $589.7million. although
consolidated revenues increased 5.5% over fiscal 2000, income
before income taxes was essentially flat as pretax profit
margins decreased due to a lower gross margin percentage, higher
interest expense, and increased other expenses, partially offset
by lower selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of
revenues. despite flat income before income taxes, net income
increased due to a lower effective tax rate. diluted earnings
per share increased 4.3%, from $2.07 to$2.16. the
percentage increase in earnings per share was higher than that
of net income primarily due to share repurchases in fiscal years
2000 and2001.
nike brand revenues in the u.s.region
increased 1.8% as compared to fiscal 2000, while nike brand
revenues in our international regions increased 9.8%. had the
u.s.dollar remained constant with the prior year, these
international revenues would have increased 18.6%, and
consolidated revenues would have advanced 9.3%. in the u.s.
region, our largest market segment, the 1.8% increase in
revenues reflected a 9.2% increase in apparel sales and a 54.4%
increase in equipment sales, offset by a 4.2% decrease in
footwear sales. the increases in apparel and equipment reflected
stronger demand for in-line products. the increase in the
equipment product line reflected increases in a variety of
sports equipment categories, including golf, football, and
baseball products as well as socks, bags and eyewear. the
decrease in footwear reflected lower demand, particularly in the
mid-range price segment, and supply chain disruptions resulting
from the implementation of
table of contents
a new global demand and supply planning system.
the supply chain disruptions resulted in product excesses as
well as product shortages and late deliveries in the second half
of the fiscal2001.
revenues from our international regions were
$4.2billion as compared to $3.9billion in fiscal
2000. fiscal 2001 revenues in emea increased over fiscal 2000 by
7.4% to $2,584.8million, a 19.3% increase in constant
dollars. in our asia pacific region, revenues grew 16.2%, a
20.8% increase in constant dollars. the americas region grew
revenues 9.1%, an 11.4% increase in constant dollars.
in fiscal 2001, other revenue increased 7.2% to
$435.9million.
our gross margin percentage declined
90basis points, from 39.9% in fiscal 2000 to 39.0% in
fiscal 2001. factors contributing to the lower gross margin
percentage were as follows:
(1)
the effect of the change in foreign exchange
rates, most notably the weakening of the euro against the u.s.
dollar relative to fiscal 2000.
(2)
a higher mix of close-out sales as well as lower
margins achieved on close-outs, primarily in footwear and
licensed team apparel in the u.s. in footwear, the higher mix of
close-outs and lower close-out margins were due in part to the
supply chain disruptions discussed above. higher close-outs and
lower margins in u.s.licensed team apparel resulted
primarily from the liquidation of national football league
(nfl) team apparel, due to the termination of our
nfl license agreement.
(3)
product recalls of certain footwear models in the
united states, which resulted in product returns and write-offs.
selling and administrative expenses decreased as
a percentage of revenues from 29.0% to 28.3%. demand creation
expense decreased as a percentage of revenues from 10.8% to
10.5%. fiscal 2001 demand creation expense was
$998.2million versus $974.1million in fiscal 2000.
the overall decrease in selling and administrative expenses as a
percentage of revenues reflected cost containment measures, both
in marketing and operational areas. while implementing these
measures to control selling and administrative expense growth,
we also continued to invest in operational initiatives designed
to create future revenues and profits. these initiatives
included the expansion of nike-owned retail outlets, the
development of e-commerce applications, and systems and
processes supporting our worldwide supply chain. our level of
investment in these areas in fiscal 2001 was comparable to our
level of investment in fiscal 2000.
interest expense increased 30.4%, from
$45.0million to $58.7million, due to higher average
debt levels in fiscal 2001 versus fiscal 2000. during fiscal
2000, we increased debt to fund capital expenditures and higher
working capital requirements, and to repurchase common stock.
although our debt balance decreased during fiscal 2001, the
average debt balance for fiscal 2001 remained above the prior
year.
other income/ expense was a net expense of
$34.1million versus a net expense of $20.7million in
fiscal 2000. significant amounts included in other income/
expense were interest income, profit sharing expense, goodwill
amortization, certain foreign currency conversion gains and
losses, asset disposal gains and losses, and charges for
contractual settlements.
our fiscal 2001 effective tax rate was 36.0% as
compared to 37.0% in fiscal 2000. as discussed above, we do not
accrue for u.s.tax liability on foreign earnings
permanently invested offshore. the lower effective tax rate in
fiscal 2001 was primarily the result of lower taxes on a larger
amount of foreign earnings that were permanently invested
offshore in fiscal 2001 than in fiscal 2000 as well as
additional research tax credits.
recently issued accounting standards
in july 2001, the financial accounting standards
board (fasb)issued sfasno.141, business
combinations (fas141) and sfasno.142,
goodwill and other intangible assets (fas142).
fas141 requires the purchase method of accounting to be
used for all business combinations initiated after june30,
2001. fas141 also requires a more rigorous identification
of intangible assets which must be
table of contents
recognized and reported separately from goodwill.
the adoption of fas141 will not have a material effect on
our results of operations or financial position.
fas142 requires that goodwill and
intangible assets with indefinite lives no longer be amortized
but instead be measured for impairment at least annually, or
when events indicate that an impairment exists. our adoption
date is june1, 2002. as of that date, amortization of
outstanding goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible
assets will cease. as a result of the elimination of this
amortization, other expense will decrease by approximately
$13million annually beginning in fiscal 2003.
as required by fas142, we will perform
impairment tests on goodwill and other indefinite-lived
intangible assets as of the adoption date. thereafter, we will
perform impairment tests annually and whenever events or
circumstances indicate that the value of goodwill or other
indefinite-lived intangible assets might be impaired. in
connection with the fas142 indefinite-lived intangible
asset impairment test, we will utilize the required one-step
method to determine whether an impairment exists as of the
adoption date. the test will consist of a comparison of the
estimated fair values of indefinite-lived assets with the
carrying amounts. if the carrying amount of an intangible asset
exceeds our estimate of its fair value, we will recognize an
impairment loss in an amount equal to that excess.
in connection with the fas142 transitional
goodwill impairment test, we will utilize the required two-step
method for determining goodwill impairment as of the adoption
date. to accomplish this, we will identify our reporting units
and determine the carrying value of each reporting unit by
assigning our assets and liabilities, including the existing
goodwill and intangible assets, to those reporting units as of
the adoption date. we will then estimate the fair value of each
reporting unit and compare it to the carrying amount of the
reporting unit. to the extent the carrying amount of a reporting
unit exceeds our estimate of the fair value of the reporting
unit, we then will perform the second step of the transitional
impairment test.
where necessary, in the second step, we will
compare the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill
with the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill, both of
which will be measured as of the adoption date. the implied fair
value of goodwill will be determined by allocating the estimated
fair value of the reporting unit to all of the assets
(recognized and unrecognized) and liabilities of the reporting
unit in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation, in
accordance with fas 141. the residual fair value after this
allocation will be the implied fair value of the reporting unit
goodwill. we will record a transitional impairment loss for any
excess of the carrying value of goodwill allocated to the
reporting unit over the implied fair value.
we have estimated that we will likely incur a
transitional impairment loss of approximately $270million
related to our bauer nike hockey and cole haan subsidiaries,
reflecting that the fair values we have estimated for these
subsidiaries are less than the carrying values including
goodwill. this expected transitional impairment loss will be
recognized as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting
principle in our consolidated statement of income during the
first quarter of fiscal 2003.
in october 2001, the fasb issued
sfasno.144, accounting for the impairment or
disposal of long-lived assets (fas144). this
statement supersedes sfasno.121, accounting
for the impairment of long-lived assets and for long-lived
assets to be disposed of (fas121), and amends
accounting principles board statement no.30,
reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a
business, and extraordinary, unusual and infrequently occurring
events and transactions (apb30). fas144
requires that long-lived assets that are to be disposed of by
sale be measured at the lower of book value or fair value less
costs to sell. fas144 retains the fundamental provisions
of fas121 for (a)recognition and measurement of the
impairment of long-lived assets to be held and used and
(b)measurement of long-lived assets to be disposed of by
sale. this statement also retains apb30s requirement
that companies report discontinued operations separately from
continuing operations. all provisions of this statement will be
effective for us on june1, 2003. we do not expect that the
adoption of fas144 will have any impact on our
consolidated financial position or results of operations.

liquidity and capital resources
fiscal 2002 cash flow
activity
cash provided by operations was
$1,081.5million in fiscal 2002, compared to
$656.5million in fiscal 2001. our primary source of
operating cash flow was net income earned during the year of
$663.3million. operating cash flow increased significantly
over the prior year due to reduced investment in certain working
capital components during fiscal 2002, which generated positive
operating cash flow.
cash used by investing activities during fiscal
2002 was $302.8million, compared to $342.3million
invested during fiscal 2001. the total for fiscal 2002 related
primarily to capital expenditures for computer equipment and
software, driven by our supply chain initiative, and investments
in new retail outlets. in addition, we acquired all of the
assets and substantially all of the liabilities of hurley
international llc, a teen lifestyle brand company. during fiscal
2003, we will continue to incur expenditures related to systems
improvements (most notably the supply chain initiative), retail
expansion, and investments in our worldwide warehouse facilities.
cash used by financing activities in fiscal 2002
was $478.2million, up from $349.9million in the
prior year. this amount included uses of cash for dividends to
shareholders, a net reduction in debt, and share repurchases.
these uses of cash were partially offset by proceeds from the
exercise of employee stock options.
the share repurchases were part of a
$1.0billion share repurchase program that began in fiscal
2001, after completion of a four-year, $1.0billion program
in fiscal 2000. in fiscal 2002, we repurchased 4.3million
shares of nikes classb common stock for
$237.7million. to date, under the current program, we have
purchased a total of 8.3million shares of nikes
classb common stock for $394.7million. we expect to
fund the current program from operating cash flow. the timing
and the amount of shares purchased will be dictated by our
capital needs and stock market conditions.

the amounts listed for endorsement contracts
represent approximate amounts of base compensation and minimum
guaranteed royalty fees we are obligated to pay athlete and
sport team endorsers of our products. actual payments under some
contracts are likely be higher than the amounts listed as these
contracts provide for bonuses to be paid to the endorsers based
upon athletic achievements in future periods. actual payments
under some contracts may also be lower as a limited number of
contracts include provisions for reduced payments if athlete
performance declines in future periods.
in addition to the cash payments disclosed above,
we are obligated to furnish the endorsers with nike products for
their use. it is not possible to determine how much we will
spend on this product on an annual basis as the contracts do not
stipulate a specific amount of cash to be spent on the product.
the amount of product provided to the endorsers will depend on
many factors including general playing conditions, the number of
sporting events in which they participate, and our own decisions
regarding product and marketing initiatives. in addition, the
costs to design, develop, source, and purchase the products
furnished to the endorsers are incurred over a period of time
and are not necessarily tracked separately from similar costs
incurred for products sold to customers.
an outsourcing contractor provides us with
information technology operations management services through
2006. the amount of the payments in future years depends on our
level of monthly use of the different elements of the
contractors services. if we were to terminate the entire
contract as of may31, 2002, we would
table of contents
be required to provide the contractor with four
months notice and pay a termination liability of
$22.6million. our monthly payments to the contractor
currently are approximately $6million.
we also have the following outstanding short-term
debt obligations as of may31, 2002. please refer to the
accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements
(note4 short-term borrowings and credit
lines) for further description and interest rates related to
the below short-term debt obligations.

capital resources
we have an effective shelf registration statement
on file with the securities and exchange commission
(sec)under which $1.0billion in debt securities are
available to be issued. on may29, 2002, we commenced a
medium-term note program under the shelf registration that
allows us to issue up to $500.0million in medium-term
notes, as our capital needs dictate. we entered into this
program to provide additional liquidity to meet our working
capital and general corporate cash requirements. as of
may31, 2002, we had not issued any debt securities under
the shelf registration.
subsequent to may31, 2002, we issued a
total of $90million in notes under the medium-term note
program. the notes have coupon rates that range from 4.80% to
5.66%. the maturities range from july9, 2007 to
august7, 2012. for $75million of the notes, we
simultaneously entered into interest rate swap agreements
whereby we receive fixed interest payments at the same rate as
the notes and pay variable interest payments based on the
six-month london inter bank offering rate (libor)plus a
spread. each swap has the same notional amount and maturity date
as its respective note. after issuance of these notes,
$910.0million remains available to be issued under our
shelf registration. we may issue additional notes under the
shelf registration in fiscal 2003 depending on working capital
and general corporate needs.
as of may31, 2001, we had a
$750.0million, 364-day committed credit facility and a
$500.0million, multi-year committed credit facility in
place with a group of banks. in november 2001, we renewed the
364-day facility in the amount of $600.0million. thus, our
current total availability under these two bank facilities is
$1.1billion. we currently have no amounts outstanding
under these facilities. the $600.0million facility matures
on november15, 2002 and can be extended 364days on
each maturity date. the $500.0million facility matures on
november17, 2005, and once a year, it can be extended for
one additional year. based on our current long-term senior
unsecured debt ratings of a and a2 from standard and poors
corporation and moodys investor services, respectively,
the interest rate charged on any outstanding borrowings on the
$600.0million facility would be the prevailing libor plus
0.24%, and the interest rate charged on any outstanding
borrowings on the $500.0million facility would be the
prevailing libor plus 0.22%. the facility fees for the
$600.0million and the $500.0million facilities are
0.06% and 0.08%, respectively, of the total commitment.
if our long-term debt rating were to decline, the
facility fees and interest rates under our committed credit
facilities would increase. conversely, if our long-term debt
rating improves, the facility fees and interest rates would
decrease. changes in our long-term debt rating would not trigger
acceleration of maturity of any then outstanding borrowings or
any future borrowings under the committed credit facilities.
however, under
table of contents
these committed credit facilities, we have agreed
to various covenants. these covenants include limits on our
disposal of fixed assets and the amount of debt secured by liens
we may incur, and set a minimum ratio of net worth to
indebtedness. in the event we were to have any borrowings
outstanding under these facilities, failed to meet any covenant,
and were unable to obtain a waiver from a majority of the banks,
any borrowings would become immediately due and payable. as of
may31, 2002, we were in full compliance with each of these
covenants and believe it is unlikely we will fail to meet any of
these covenants in the future.
liquidity is also provided by our commercial
paper program, under which there was $338.3million and
$710.0million outstanding at may31, 2002 and may 31,
2001, respectively. we currently have short-term debt ratings of
a1 and p1 from standard and poors corporation and
moodys investor services, respectively.
we currently believe that cash generated by
operations, together with access to external sources of funds as
described above, will be sufficient to meet our operating and
capital needs.
dividends per share of common stock for fiscal
2002 were $0.48, the same as in fiscal 2001. we have paid a
dividend every quarter since february 1984. we review our
dividend policy from time to time; however, based upon current
projected earnings and cash flow requirements, we anticipate
continuing to pay a quarterly dividend.
item7a.quantitative
and qualitative disclosures about market risk
in the normal course of business and consistent
with established policies and procedures, we employ a variety of
financial instruments to manage exposure to fluctuations in the
value of foreign currencies and interest rates. it is our policy
to utilize these financial instruments only where necessary to
finance our business and manage such exposures; we do not enter
into these transactions for speculative purposes.
we are exposed to foreign currency fluctuation as
a result of our international sales, production and funding
activities. our foreign currency risk management objective is to
reduce the variability of local entity cash flows as a result of
exchange rate movements. we use forward exchange contracts and
options to hedge certain anticipated but not yet firmly
committed transactions as well as certain firm commitments and
the related receivables and payables, including third party or
intercompany transactions.
when we begin hedging exposures depends on the
nature of the exposure and market conditions. generally, all
anticipated and firmly committed transactions that are hedged
are to be recognized within twelve months, although at
may31, 2002 we had forward contracts hedging anticipated
transactions that will be recognized in as many as
24months. the majority of the contracts expiring in more
than twelve months relate to the anticipated purchase of
inventory by our japanese subsidiary. we use forward contracts
and cross-currency swaps to hedge foreign currency denominated
payments under intercompany loan agreements. when intercompany
loans are hedged, it is typically for their expected duration,
which in some circumstances may be in excess of five years.
hedged transactions are principally denominated in european
currencies, japanese yen, canadian dollars, korean won, mexican
pesos, australian dollars and new taiwan dollars.
our earnings are also exposed to movements in
short and long-term market interest rates. our objective in
managing this interest rate exposure is to limit the impact of
interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows, and to reduce
overall borrowing costs. to achieve these objectives, we
maintain a mix of medium and long-term fixed rate debt,
commercial paper, and bank loans and have entered into interest
rate swaps under which we receive fixed interest and pay
variable interest.
market risk measurement
we monitor foreign exchange risk, interest rate
risk and related derivatives using a variety of techniques
including a review of market value, sensitivity analysis, and
value-at-risk (var). our market-sensitive derivative and other
financial instruments, as defined by the sec, are foreign
currency forward contracts, foreign currency option contracts,
cross-currency swaps, interest rate swaps, intercompany loans
denominated in foreign currencies, fixed interest rate
u.s.dollar denominated debt, and fixed interest rate
japanese yen denominated debt.
table of contents
we use var to monitor the foreign exchange risk
of our foreign currency forward and foreign currency option
derivative instruments only. the var determines the maximum
potential one-day loss in the fair value of these foreign
exchange rate-sensitive financial instruments. the var model
estimates assume normal market conditions and a 95% confidence
level. there are various modeling techniques that can be used in
the var computation. our computations are based on
interrelationships between currencies and interest rates
(avariance/ co-variance technique). these
interrelationships are a function of foreign exchange currency
market changes and interest rate changes over the preceding one
year. the value of foreign currency options does not change on a
one-to-one basis with changes in the underlying currency rate.
we adjusted the potential loss in option value for the estimated
sensitivity (the delta and gamma) to
changes in the underlying currency rate. this calculation
reflects the impact of foreign currency rate fluctuations on the
derivative instruments only, and hence does not include the
impact of such rate fluctuations on the underlying based
transactions that are anticipated transactions, firm
commitments, cash balances and accounts and loans receivable and
payable denominated in foreign currencies from the var
calculation, including those which are hedged by these
instruments.
the var model is a risk analysis tool and does
not purport to represent actual losses in fair value that we
will incur, nor does it consider the potential effect of
favorable changes in market rates. it also does not represent
the full extent of the possible loss that may occur. actual
future gains and losses will differ from those estimated because
of changes or differences in market rates and
interrelationships, hedging instruments and hedge percentages,
timing and other factors.
the estimated maximum one-day loss in fair value
on our foreign currency sensitive financial instruments, derived
using the var model, was $13.7million and
$18.9million at may31, 2002 and may31, 2001,
respectively. the reduction in var as of may31, 2002
occurred due to the effect of currency volatility on existing
trades on the may31, 2002 var computation versus the
effect of currency volatility on existing trades on the
may31, 2001 var computation. such a hypothetical loss in
fair value of our derivatives would be offset by increases in
the value of the underlying transactions being hedged. the
average monthly change in the fair values of foreign currency
forward and foreign currency option derivative instruments was
$42.9million and $22.4million for fiscal 2002 and
fiscal 2001, respectively.
details of other market-sensitive financial
instruments and derivative financial instruments not included in
the var calculation above, are provided in the table below
except the interest rate swaps which are described in the last
paragraph of this section. these instruments include
intercompany loans denominated in foreign currencies, fixed
interest rate japanese yen denominated debt, fixed interest rate
u.s.dollar denominated debt, cross-currency swaps, and
interest rate swaps. for debt obligations, the table presents
principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates
by expected maturity dates. we have excluded the cross-currency
swaps from the foreign exchange risk category because these
instruments eliminate all foreign currency exposure in the cash
flows of a euro denominated intercompany loan. we have included
these cross-currency swaps in the interest rate risk category
but excluded the related intercompany loan from this category
because the intercompany interest eliminates in consolidation.
for the cross-currency swaps the table presents both the euro
swap payable and u.s.dollar swap receivable and the
respective pay and receive interest rates. all information is
presented in u.s.dollar equivalents, in millions, except
interest rates.
intercompany loans and related interest amounts
eliminate in consolidation. intercompany loans are generally
hedged against foreign exchange risk through the use of forward
contracts and swaps with third parties.
the fixed interest rate japanese yen denominated
debts were issued by and are accounted for by two of our
japanese subsidiaries. accordingly, the monthly remeasurement of
these instruments due to changes in foreign exchange rates is
recognized in accumulated other comprehensive loss upon the
consolidation of these subsidiaries.
there was not a significant change in debt or
cross-currency swap market risks during fiscal 2002. the
u.s.dollar fair values of intercompany loans denominated
in foreign currencies was $647.2million at may31,
2001, which is the same as the carrying values of the loans
prior to their elimination. the u.s.dollar fair value of
the fixed rate japanese yen denominated debt that was
outstanding at may31, 2001 was $181.1million
table of contents
versus a carrying value of $191.0million at
that date. the u.s.dollar fair values of the fixed rate
u.s.dollar denominated debt, the euro swap payable and the
u.s.dollar swap receivable as of may31, 2001 were
$256.2million, $179.4million and
$266.4million, respectively, versus carrying values of
$249.6million, $172.6million and
$250.0million, respectively, at that date.
in august 2001, we issued a $250million
corporate bond maturing in august 2006, with a fixed interest
rate of 5.5%. in november 2001, we entered into receive-fixed
pay-variable interest rate swap agreements to hedge the interest
rate exposure related to this bond. the interest rate swaps have
an aggregate notional amount of $250million maturing in
august 2006. the receive-fixed rates on the swaps match the
fixed rate on the bond, and the pay-variable rates are based on
the three-month libor rates plus a spread. as a result of the
interest rate swap agreements, our effective interest rate on
the $250million corporate bond was 3.3% as of may31,
2002. the difference between the carrying amounts and fair value
of the corporate bond and related interest rate swaps was
$1.8million at may31, 2002.

special note regarding forward-looking
statements and analyst reports
certain written and oral statements, other than
purely historical information, including estimates, projections,
statements relating to nikes business plans, objectives
and expected operating results, and the assumptions upon which
those statements are based, made or incorporated by reference
from time to time by nike or its representatives in this report,
other reports, filings with the securities and exchange
commission, press releases, conferences, or otherwise, are
forward-looking statements within the meaning of the
private securities litigation reform act of 1995 and
section21e of the securities exchange act of 1934.
forward-looking statements include, without limitation, any
statement that may predict, forecast, indicate, or imply future
results, performance, or achievements, and may contain the words
believe, anticipate, expect,
estimate, project, will be,
will continue, will likely result, or
words or phrases of similar meaning. forward-looking statements
involve risks and uncertainties which may cause actual results
to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. the
risks and uncertainties are detailed from time to time in
reports filed by nike with the sec, including forms8-k,
10-q, and 10-k, and include, among others, the following:
international, national and local general economic and market
conditions; the size and growth of the overall athletic
footwear, apparel, and equipment markets; intense competition
among designers, marketers, distributors and sellers of athletic
footwear, apparel, and equipment for consumers and endorsers;
demographic changes; changes in consumer preferences; popularity
of particular designs, categories of products, and sports;
seasonal and geographic demand for nike products; difficulties
in anticipating or forecasting changes in consumer preferences,
consumer demand for nike products, and the various market
factors described above; difficulties in implementing,
operating, and maintaining nikes increasingly complex
information systems and controls, including, without limitation,
the systems related to demand and supply planning, and inventory
control; interruptions in data and communications systems;
fluctuations and difficulty in forecasting operating results,
including, without limitation, the fact that advance
futures orders may not be indicative of future
revenues due to the changing mix of futures and at-once orders;
the ability of nike to sustain, manage or forecast its growth
and inventories; the size, timing and mix of purchases of
nikes products; new product development and introduction;
the ability to secure and protect trademarks, patents, and other
intellectual property; performance and reliability of products;
customer service; adverse publicity; the loss of significant
customers or suppliers; dependence on distributors; business
disruptions; increased costs of freight and transportation to
meet delivery deadlines; increases in borrowing costs due to any
decline in our debt ratings; changes in business strategy or
development plans; general risks associated with doing business
outside the united states, including without limitation, import
duties, tariffs, quotas and political and economic instability;
changes in government regulations; liability and other claims
asserted against nike; the ability to
table of contents
attract and retain qualified personnel; and other
factors referenced or incorporated by reference in this report
and other reports.
the risks included here are not exhaustive. other
sections of this report may include additional factors which
could adversely affect nikes business and financial
performance. moreover, nike operates in a very competitive and
rapidly changing environment. new risk factors emerge from time
to time and it is not possible for management to predict all
such risk factors, nor can it assess the impact of all such risk
factors on nikes business or the extent to which any
factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to
differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking
statements. given these risks and uncertainties, investors
should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements as
a prediction of actual results.
investors should also be aware that while nike
does, from time to time, communicate with securities analysts,
it is against nikes policy to disclose to them any
material non-public information or other confidential commercial
information. accordingly, shareholders should not assume that
nike agrees with any statement or report issued by any analyst
irrespective of the content of the statement or report.
furthermore, nike has a policy against issuing or confirming
financial forecasts or projections issued by others. thus, to
the extent that reports issued by securities analysts contain
any projections, forecasts or opinions, such reports are not the
responsibility of nike.
item8.financial
statements and supplemental data
management of nike, inc. is responsible for the
information and representations contained in this report. the
financial statements have been prepared in conformity with the
generally accepted accounting principles we considered
appropriate in the circumstances and include some amounts based
on our best estimates and judgments. other financial information
in this report is consistent with these financial statements.
our accounting systems include controls designed
to reasonably assure that assets are safeguarded from
unauthorized use or disposition and which provide for the
preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles. these systems are supplemented
by the selection and training of qualified financial personnel
and an organizational structure providing for appropriate
segregation of duties.
an internal audit department reviews the results
of its work with the audit committee of the board of directors,
presently consisting of three outside directors. the audit
committee is responsible for recommending to the board of
directors the appointment of the independent accountants and
reviews with the independent accountants, management and the
internal audit staff, the scope and the results of the annual
examination, the effectiveness of the accounting control system
and other matters relating to the financial affairs of nike as
they deem appropriate. the independent accountants and the
internal auditors have full access to the committee, with and
without the presence of management, to discuss any appropriate
matters.
table of contents
report of independent accountants
to the board of directors and
shareholders of nike, inc.
in our opinion, the consolidated financial
statements listed in the index appearing under
item14(a)(1) on page55 present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of nike, inc. and its
subsidiaries at may31, 2002 and 2001, and the results of
their operations and their cash flows for each of the three
years in the period ended may31, 2002 in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of
america. in addition, in our opinion, the financial statement
schedule listed in the index appearing under item14(a)(2)
on page55 presents fairly, in all material respects, the
information set forth therein when read in conjunction with the
related consolidated financial statements. these financial
statements and financial statement schedule are the
responsibility of the companys management; our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements and financial statement schedule based on our audits.
we conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with
auditing standards generally accepted in the united states of
america, which require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. an audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, and evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. we believe that our audits provide a reasonable
basis for our opinion.
as discussed in note1 to the consolidated
financial statements, effective june1, 2001, the company
changed its method of accounting for derivative instruments in
accordance with statement of financial accounting standards
no.133 accounting for derivative instruments and
hedging activities and statement of financial accounting
standards no.138, accounting for certain derivative
instruments and certain hedging activities.

notes to consolidated financial
statements
note 1 summary of significant
accounting policies
basis of consolidation
the consolidated financial statements include the
accounts of nike, inc. and its subsidiaries (the company). all
significant intercompany transactions and balances have been
eliminated.
recognition of revenues
wholesale revenues are recognized when title
passes and the risks and rewards of ownership have passed to the
customer, based on the terms of sale. title passes generally
upon shipment or upon receipt by the customer depending on the
country of the sale and the agreement with the customer. retail
store revenues are recorded at the time of sale. provisions for
sales discounts and returns are made at the time of sale.
shipping and handling costs
shipping and handling costs are expensed as
incurred and included in cost of sales.
advertising and promotion
advertising production costs are expensed the
first time the advertisement is run. media (tv and print)
placement costs are expensed in the month the advertising
appears. a significant amount of the companys promotional
expenses result from payments under endorsement contracts.
accounting for endorsement payments is based upon specific
contract provisions. generally, endorsement payments are
expensed uniformly over the term of the contract after giving
recognition to periodic performance compliance provisions of the
contracts. prepayments made under contracts are included in
prepaid expenses and other current assets or other assets
depending on the length of the contract. through cooperative
advertising programs, we reimburse our retail customers for
certain of their costs of advertising our products. we record
these costs in selling and administrative expense at the point
in time when we are obligated to our customers for the costs.
this obligation may arise prior to the related advertisement
being run. total advertising and promotion expenses were
$1,027.9million, $998.2million and
$974.1million for the years ended may31, 2002, 2001
and 2000, respectively. included in prepaid expenses and other
current assets and other assets was $113.2million and
$122.3million at may31, 2002 and 2001, respectively,
relating to prepaid advertising and promotion expenses.
cash and equivalents
cash and equivalents represent cash and
short-term, highly liquid investments with original maturities
of three months or less.
inventory valuation
inventories are stated at the lower of cost or
market. inventories are valued on a first-in, first-out (fifo)
or moving-average cost basis.
property, plant and equipment and
depreciation
property, plant and equipment are recorded at
cost. depreciation for financial reporting purposes is
determined on a straight-line basis for buildings and leasehold
improvements over 2 to 40years and principally on a
declining balance basis for machinery and equipment over 2 to
15years. computer software is depreciated on a
straight-line basis over 3 to 10years.
table of contents
nike, inc.
notes to consolidated financial
statements(continued)
identifiable intangible assets and
goodwill
at may31, 2002 and 2001, the company had
patents, trademarks and other identifiable intangible assets
recorded at a cost of $264.2million and $218.6 million,
respectively. the companys excess of purchase cost over
the fair value of net assets of businesses acquired
(goodwill)was $333.6million and $322.5million
at may31, 2002 and 2001, respectively.
identifiable intangible assets and goodwill are
being amortized over their estimated useful lives on a
straight-line basis over five to forty years. accumulated
amortization was $160.0million and $143.8million at
may31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. amortization expense,
which is included in other income/expense, was
$15.7million, $15.6million and $18.5million
for the years ended may31, 2002, 2001 and 2000,
respectively.
impairment of long-lived
assets
when events or circumstances indicate the
carrying value of a long-lived asset may be impaired, the
company estimates the future undiscounted cash flows to be
derived from the asset to assess whether or not a potential
impairment exists. if the carrying value exceeds our estimate of
future undiscounted cash flows, we then calculate the impairment
as the excess of the carrying value of the asset over our
estimate of its fair market value.
foreign currency translation and foreign
currency transactions
adjustments resulting from translating foreign
functional currency financial statements into u.s. dollars are
included in the foreign currency translation adjustment, a
component of accumulated other comprehensive loss in
shareholders equity.
transaction gains and losses generated by the
effect of foreign exchange on recorded assets and liabilities
denominated in a currency different from the functional currency
of the applicable company entity are recorded in other
income/expense currently.
net foreign currency transaction gains, which
include transaction gains and losses referred to above as well
as hedge results captured in revenues, cost of sales, selling
and administrative expense and other income/expense, were
$45.1million, $129.6million, and $36.1million
for the years ended may31, 2002, 2001, and 2000
respectively.
adoption of fas 133
the company adopted statement of financial
accounting standards (sfas) no.133,
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging
activities, as amended by sfas no.138,
accounting for certain derivative instruments and certain
hedging activities (fas133) on june1, 2001.
in accordance with the transition provisions of
fas133, the company recorded a one-time transition
adjustment as of june1, 2001 on both the consolidated
statement of income and the consolidated balance sheet. the
transition adjustment on the consolidated statement of income
was a charge of $5.0million, net of tax effect. this
amount related to an investment that was adjusted to fair value
in accordance with fas133. the transition adjustment on
the consolidated balance sheet represented the initial
recognition of the fair values of hedge derivatives outstanding
on the adoption date and realized gains and losses on effective
hedges for which the underlying exposure had not yet affected
earnings. the transition adjustment on the consolidated balance
sheet was an increase in current assets of $116.4million,
an increase in noncurrent assets of $87.0million, an
increase in current liabilities of $151.6million, and an
increase in other comprehensive income of approximately
$56.8million, net of tax effect. the majority of the
$56.8million recorded in other comprehensive income as of
june1, 2001 related to outstanding derivatives at that
date. because exchange rates on the transition date were
different from those on the maturity dates of these derivatives
and because
table of contents
nike, inc.
notes to consolidated financial
statements(continued)
some contracts maturing during the year ended
may31, 2002 were entered into after the transition date,
amounts ultimately reclassified to earnings during the year
ended may31, 2002, as described in note 12, are
significantly different from this amount.
accounting for derivatives and hedging
activities
the purpose of the companys foreign
currency hedging activities is to protect the company from the
risk that the eventual cash flows resulting from transactions in
foreign currencies, including revenues, product costs, selling
and administrative expenses, and intercompany transactions,
including intercompany borrowings, will be adversely affected by
changes in exchange rates. the company does not hold or issue
derivatives for trading purposes. it is the companys
policy to utilize derivatives to reduce foreign exchange risks
where internal netting strategies cannot be effectively
employed. fluctuations in the value of hedging instruments are
offset by fluctuations in the value of the underlying exposures
being hedged.
derivatives used by the company to hedge the
risks described above are forward exchange contracts, options
and cross-currency swaps. these instruments protect against the
risk that the eventual net cash inflows and outflows from
foreign currency denominated transactions will be adversely
affected by changes in exchange rates. the cross-currency swaps
are used to hedge foreign currency denominated payments related
to intercompany loan agreements. hedged transactions are
denominated primarily in european currencies, japanese yen,
canadian dollars, korean won, mexican pesos, australian dollars,
and new taiwan dollars. the company hedges up to 100% of
anticipated exposures typically twelve months in advance but has
hedged as much as 32months in advance. when intercompany
loans are hedged, it is typically for their expected duration,
which in some circumstances may be in excess of five years.
the company is also exposed to the risk of
changes in the fair value of certain fixed-rate debt
attributable to changes in interest rates. derivatives currently
used by the company to hedge this risk are receive-fixed,
pay-variable interest rate swaps. see note5.
all derivatives are recognized on the balance
sheet at their fair value. unrealized gain positions are
recorded as other current assets or other non-current assets.
unrealized loss positions are recorded as accrued liabilities or
other non-current liabilities.
the fair values of the interest rate swap
agreements are recorded as other non-current assets or other
non-current liabilities. the unrealized gain or loss on the
interest rate swaps is exactly offset by an unrealized loss or
gain on the underlying long-term debt.
substantially all foreign currency derivatives
entered into by the company qualify for and are designated as
foreign-currency cash flow hedges, including those hedging
foreign currency denominated firm commitments.
the interest rate swap agreements are designated
as fair value hedges of the related long-term debt and meet the
shortcut method requirements under fas133. accordingly,
interest expense on the related long-term debt is recorded based
on the variable rates paid under the interest rate swap
agreements, and changes in the fair values of the interest rate
swap agreements exactly offset changes in the fair value of the
long-term debt.
the company considers whether any provisions in
non-derivative contracts represent embedded
derivative instruments as described in fas133. for the
period ended may31, 2002 the company has concluded that no
embedded derivative instruments warrant separate
fair value accounting under fas133.
changes in fair values of outstanding cash flow
hedge derivatives that are highly effective are recorded in
other comprehensive income, until earnings are affected by the
variability of cash flows of the hedged transaction. in most
cases amounts recorded in other comprehensive income will be
released to earnings some time after the maturity of the related
derivative. the consolidated statement of income classification
of
table of contents
nike, inc.
notes to consolidated financial
statements(continued)
effective hedge results is the same as that of
the underlying exposure. results of hedges of revenue and
product costs are recorded in revenue and cost of sales,
respectively, when the underlying hedged transaction affects
earnings. results of hedges of selling and administrative
expense are recorded together with those costs when the related
expense is recorded. results of hedges of anticipated
intercompany transactions are recorded in other income/expense
when the transaction occurs. hedges of recorded balance sheet
positions are recorded in other income/expense currently
together with the transaction gain or loss from the hedged
balance sheet position. unrealized derivative gains and losses
recorded in current and non-current assets and liabilities and
amounts recorded in other comprehensive income are non-cash
items and therefore are taken into account in the preparation of
the consolidated statement of cash flows based on their
respective balance sheet classifications.
the critical terms of the companys
outstanding interest rate swap agreements exactly match the
critical terms of the underlying debt. therefore, under the
shortcut provisions of fas133, the swaps are considered
perfectly effective.
the company formally documents all relationships
between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as its
risk-management objective and strategy for undertaking hedge
transactions. this process includes linking all derivatives that
are designated as foreign-currency cash flow hedges to either
specific assets and liabilities on the balance sheet or specific
firm commitments or forecasted transactions. the company also
formally assesses, both at the hedges inception and on an
ongoing basis, whether the derivatives that are used in hedging
transactions have been highly effective in offsetting changes in
the cash flows of hedged items and whether those derivatives may
be expected to remain highly effective in future periods. when
it is determined that a derivative is not, or has ceased to be,
highly effective as a hedge, the company discontinues hedge
accounting prospectively, as discussed below.
the company discontinues hedge accounting
prospectively when (1)it determines that the derivative is
no longer highly effective in offsetting changes in the cash
flows of a hedged item (including hedged items such as firm
commitments or forecasted transactions); (2)the derivative
expires or is sold, terminated, or exercised; (3)it is no
longer probable that the forecasted transaction will occur; or
(4)management determines that designating the derivative
as a hedging instrument is no longer appropriate.
when the company discontinues hedge accounting
because it is no longer probable that the forecasted transaction
will occur in the originally expected period, the gain or loss
on the derivative remains in accumulated other comprehensive
income and is reclassified into earnings when the forecasted
transaction affects earnings. however, if it is probable that a
forecasted transaction will not occur by the end of the
originally specified time period or within an additional
two-month period of time thereafter, the gains and losses that
were accumulated in other comprehensive loss will be recognized
immediately in earnings. in all situations in which hedge
accounting is discontinued and the derivative remains
outstanding, the company will carry the derivative at its fair
value on the balance sheet, recognizing future changes in the
fair value in current-period earnings. any hedge ineffectiveness
is recorded in current-period earnings. effectiveness is
assessed based on forward rates.
premiums paid on options are initially recorded
as deferred charges. the company assesses effectiveness on
options based on the total cash flows method and records total
changes in the options fair value to other comprehensive
income to the degree they are effective.
income taxes
united states income taxes are provided currently
on financial statement earnings of non-u.s.subsidiaries
expected to be repatriated. the company determines annually the
amount of undistributed non-u.s.earnings to invest
indefinitely in its non-u.s.operations. the company
accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method.
this approach requires the recognition of deferred tax assets
table of contents
nike, inc.
notes to consolidated financial
statements(continued)
and liabilities for the expected future tax
consequences of temporary differences between the carrying
amounts and the tax bases of other assets and liabilities. see
note6 for further discussion.
earnings per share
basic earnings per common share is calculated by
dividing net income by the weighted average number of common
shares outstanding during the year. diluted earnings per common
share is calculated by adjusting weighted average outstanding
shares, assuming conversion of all potentially dilutive stock
options and awards. see note9 for further discussion.
management estimates
the preparation of financial statements in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles
requires management to make estimates, including estimates
relating to assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities at the date of financial statements and the reported
amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
actual results could differ from these estimates.
reclassifications
certain prior year amounts have been reclassified
to conform to fiscal year 2002 presentation. these changes had
no impact on previously reported results of operations or
shareholders equity.
recently issued accounting
standards
the company will adopt sfas no.142,
goodwill and other intangible assets (fas142)
on june1, 2002. fas142 requires that goodwill and
intangible assets with indefinite lives no longer be amortized
but instead be measured for impairment at least annually, or
when events indicate that an impairment exists. as of the
adoption date, amortization of outstanding goodwill and other
indefinite-lived intangible assets will cease. as a result of
the elimination of this amortization, other expense will
decrease by approximately $13million annually beginning in
the quarter ended august31, 2002.
as required by fas142, we will perform
impairment tests on goodwill and other indefinite-lived
intangible assets as of the adoption date. thereafter, we will
perform impairment tests annually and whenever events or
circumstances indicate that the value of goodwill or other
indefinite-lived intangible assets might be impaired. in
connection with the fas142 indefinite-lived intangible
asset impairment test, we will utilize the required one-step
method to determine whether an impairment exists as of the
adoption date. in connection with the fas142 transitional
goodwill impairment test, we will utilize the required two-step
method for determining goodwill impairment as of the adoption
date.
we have estimated that we will likely incur a
transitional impairment loss of approximately $270million
related to our bauer nike hockey and cole haan subsidiaries,
reflecting that the fair values we have estimated for these
subsidiaries are less than the carrying values including
goodwill. this expected transitional impairment loss will be
recognized as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting
principle in our consolidated statement of income during the
quarter ended august31, 2002.
in october 2001, the fasb issued
sfasno.144, accounting for the impairment or
disposal of long-lived assets (fas144). this
statement supersedes sfasno.121, accounting
for the impairment of long-lived assets and for long-lived
assets to be disposed of (fas121), and amends
accounting principles board statement no.30,
reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a
business, and extraordinary, unusual and infrequently occurring
events and transactions (apb30). fas144
requires that long-lived assets that are to be disposed of by
sale be measured at the lower of book value or fair value less
costs to sell. fas 144 retains the fundamental provisions of
fas121 for (a)recognition and measurement of
table of contents
nike, inc.
notes to consolidated financial
statements(continued)
the impairment of long-lived assets to be held
and used and (b)measurement of long-lived assets to be
disposed of by sale. this statement also retains
apb30s requirement that companies report
discontinued operations separately from continuing operations.
all provisions of this statement will be effective for the
company on june1, 2003. it is not expected that the
adoption of fas144 will have any impact on the
companys consolidated financial position or results of
operations.

the company purchases through niac certain
athletic footwear and apparel it acquires from non-u.s.
suppliers. these purchases are for the companys operations
outside of the u.s., europe, and japan. accounts payable to niac
are generally due up to 60days after shipment of goods
from the foreign port. the interest rate on such accounts

the company has a $600.0million, 364-day
committed credit facility and a $500.0million, multi-year
committed credit facility in place with a group of banks under
which no amounts are outstanding. the $600.0million
facility matures on november15, 2002 and can be extended
364days on each maturity date. the $500.0million
facility matures on november17, 2005, and once a year, it
can be extended for one additional year. based on the
companys current senior unsecured debt ratings, the
interest rate charged on any outstanding borrowings on the
$600.0million facility would be the prevailing libor plus
0.24%, and the interest rate charged on any outstanding
borrowings on the $500.0million facility would be the
prevailing libor plus 0.22%. the facility fees for the
$600.0million and the $500.0million facilities are

these agreements, the company must maintain, among other things,
certain minimum specified financial ratios with which the

in february 1999, the company filed a shelf
registration with the u.s.securities and exchange
commission (sec) for the sale of up to
$500.0million in debt securities. in august 2001, we
issued a $250.0million corporate bond under this shelf
registration, maturing in august 2006, with an interest rate of
5.5%. with the proceeds, we reduced the amount of commercial
paper outstanding. in november 2001 the company entered into
interest rate swap agreements totaling $250million and
maturing august 2006, whereby the company receives fixed
interest payments at 5.5% and pays variable interest payments
based on the three-month libor plus a spread. at may31,
2002, the interest rates payable on the swap agreements were
approximately 3.3%.
we have an effective shelf registration statement
with the securities and exchange commission for $1billion
of debt securities. as of may31, 2002, we had not issued
any debt under the registration statement. subsequent to
may31, 2002, we issued a total of $90.0 million in notes
under the medium term note program of the shelf registration.
the notes have coupon rates that range from 4.80% to 5.66%. the
maturities range from july9, 2007 to august7, 2012.
for $75million of the notes, we simultaneously entered
into interest rate swap agreements whereby we receive fixed
interest payments at the same rate as the notes and pay variable
interest payments based on the six-month libor plus a spread.
each swap has the same notional amount and maturity date as the
corresponding note. after issuance of these notes,
$910.0million remains available to be issued under our
shelf registration. we may issue further notes under the shelf
registration during the year ended may31, 2003 depending
on working capital and general corporate needs.
in june 1996, one of the companys japanese
subsidiaries borrowed 10,500million japanese yen in a

interest is paid semi-annually. the agreement provides for early
retirement after year ten.
in july 1999, another of the companys
japanese subsidiaries assumed 13,000million in japanese
yen loans as part of its agreement to purchase a distribution
center in japan, which serves as collateral for the loans. these
loans mature in equal quarterly installments during the period

stock
niac is the sole owner of the companys
authorized redeemable preferred stock, $1 par value, which is
redeemable at the option of niac or the company at par value
aggregating $0.3million. a cumulative dividend of $0.10
per share is payable annually on may31 and no dividends
may be declared or paid on the common stock of the company
unless dividends on the redeemable preferred stock have been
declared and paid in full. there have been no changes in the
redeemable preferred stock in the three years ended may31,
2002. as the holder of the redeemable preferred stock, niac does
not have general voting rights but does have the right to vote
as a separate class on the sale of all or substantially all of
the assets of the company and its subsidiaries, on merger,
consolidation, liquidation or dissolution of the company or on
the sale or assignment of the nike trademark for athletic
footwear sold in the united states.
note 8 common stock
the authorized number of shares of classa
common stock no par value and classb common stock no par
value are 110million and 350million, respectively.
each share of classa common stock is convertible into one
share of classb common stock. voting rights of
classb common stock are limited in certain circumstances
with respect to the election of directors.
in 1990, the board of directors adopted, and the
shareholders approved, the nike, inc. 1990 stock incentive plan
(the 1990 plan). the 1990 plan provides for the
issuance of up to 37.5million shares of classb
common stock in connection with stock options and other awards
granted under such plan. the 1990 plan authorizes the grant of
incentive stock options, non-statutory stock options, stock
appreciation rights, stock bonuses and the sale of restricted
stock. the exercise price for incentive stock options may not be
less than the fair market value of the underlying shares on the
date of grant. the exercise price for non-statutory stock
options, stock appreciation rights and the purchase price of
restricted stock may not be less than 75% of the fair market
value of the underlying shares on the date of grant. no
consideration will be paid for stock bonuses awarded under the
1990 plan. a committee of the board of directors administers the
1990 plan. the committee has the authority to determine the
employees to whom awards will be made, the amount of the awards,
and the other terms and conditions of the awards. as of
may31, 2002, the committee has granted substantially all
non-statutory stock options at 100% of fair market value on the
date of grant under the 1990 plan.
from time to time, the company grants restricted
stock and unrestricted stock to key employees under the 1990
plan. the number of shares granted to employees during the years
ended may31, 2002 and may31, 2001 was not material.
during the year ended may31, 2000, the company granted
427,000shares of restricted stock at a market value of
$27.69 per share. the restrictions lapse and recipients of the
restricted shares become vested in the shares over a three-year
period from the date of grant. the shares are subject to partial
forfeiture if employment terminates within the three-year
period. recipients of restricted shares are entitled to cash
dividends and to vote their respective shares. the value of all
of the restricted shares was established by the market price on
the date of grant. unearned compensation was charged for the
market value of the restricted shares. the unearned compensation
is shown as a reduction of shareholders equity and

is being amortized ratably over the vesting
period. during the years ended may31, 2002, 2001, and
2000, respectively, the company recognized $4.3million,
$4.3million and $1.0million in selling and
administrative expense related to the grants, net of forfeitures.
during the years ended may31, 2002, 2001
and 2000, the company also granted shares of restricted stock
under the long-term incentive plan (ltip), adopted
by the board of directors and approved by shareholders in
september 1997. under the ltip, awards are made to certain
executives based on performance targets established over varying
time periods. once performance targets are achieved, the shares
of stock are issued and, for certain plan years, remain
restricted for an additional three years. in other plan years
the shares are immediately vested upon issuance. unvested shares
are subject to forfeiture if the executives employment
terminates within that period. plan participants are entitled to
cash dividends and to vote their respective shares. the value of
the restricted shares is established by the market price on the
date of issuance. unearned compensation is charged for the
market value of the restricted shares. the unearned compensation
is shown as a reduction of shareholders equity and is
being amortized ratably over the service and vesting periods.
under the ltip a total of 38,000restricted shares with an
average price of $49.50 were issued during the year ended
may31, 2002, 115,000restricted shares with an
average market value of $47.56 were issued during the year ended
may31, 2001, and 33,000restricted shares with an
average market value of $51.06 were issued during the year ended
may31, 2000. related to the ltip, the company recognized
$9.0million, $2.3million and $2.0million of
selling and administrative expense in the years ending
may31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively, net of
forfeitures.
sfas no.123, accounting for
stock-based compensation, (fas123) defines a fair
value method of accounting for employee stock compensation and
encourages, but does not require, all entities to adopt that
method of accounting. entities electing not to adopt the fair
value method of accounting must make pro forma disclosures of
net income and earnings per share, as if the fair value based
method of accounting defined in this statement had been applied.
the company has elected not to adopt the fair
value method; however, as required by fas 123, the company has
computed for pro forma disclosure purposes, the fair value of
options granted during the years ended may31, 2002, 2001
and 2000 using the black-scholes option pricing model. the
weighted average assumptions used for stock option grants for
each of these years were a dividend yield of 1%, expected
volatility of the market price of the companys common
stock of 38%, 39% and 37% for the years ended may31, 2002,
2001 and 2000, respectively; a weighted-average expected life of
the options of approximately five years; and interest rates of
4.8% and 5.4% for the years ended may31, 2002 and 2001,
respectively, and 5.8%, 6.2% and 6.6% for the year ended
may31, 2000. these interest rates are reflective of option
grant dates throughout the year.
options were assumed to be exercised over the
5year expected life for purposes of this valuation.
adjustments for forfeitures are made as they occur. for the
years ended may31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, the total value of
the options granted, for which no previous expense has been
recognized, was computed as approximately $73.4million,
$5.0million and $129.8million, respectively, which
would be amortized on a straight line basis over the vesting
period of the options. the weighted average fair value per share
of the options granted in the years ended may31, 2002,
2001 and 2000 are $16.02, $17.27 and $15.81, respectively.

in september 2001, the companys
shareholders approved the establishment of an employee stock
purchase plan (the espp) under which 3,000,000
shares of classb stock are reserved for issuance to
employees. the plan qualifies as a noncompensatory employee
stock purchase plan under section423 of the internal
revenue code. employees are eligible to participate through
payroll deductions in amounts ranging from 1% to 10% of their
compensation. at the end of each six-month offering period,
shares are purchased by the participants at 85% of the lower of
the fair market value at the beginning or the end of the
offering period. under the espp, 78,000 shares were issued
during the year ended may31, 2002.
note 9 earnings per
share
the following represents a reconciliation from
basic earnings per share to diluted earnings per share. options
to purchase 4.2million, 8.3million, and
9.7million shares of common stock were outstanding at
may31, 2002, 2001, and 2000, respectively, but were not
included in the computation of diluted earnings per share
because the options exercise prices were greater than the
average market price of the common shares and, therefore, the
effect would be antidilutive.

note 13 commitments and
contingencies
the company leases space for certain of its
offices, warehouses and retail stores under leases expiring from
one to fifteen years after may31, 2002. rent expense was
$159.9million, $152.0million and $145.5million
for the years ended may31, 2002, 2001 and 2000,
respectively. amounts of minimum future annual rental
commitments under non-cancelable operating leases in each of the
five years ending may31, 2003 through 2007 are
$158.2million, $143.4million, $119.1million,
$95.3million, $98.2million, respectively, and
$288.0million in later years.
as of may31, 2002 and 2001, the company had
letters of credit outstanding totaling $808.4million and
$851.8million, respectively. these letters of credit were
issued for the purchase of inventory.
in the ordinary course of its business, the
company is involved in legal proceedings involving contractual
and employment relationships, product liability claims,
trademark rights, and a variety of other matters. the company
does not believe there are any pending legal proceedings that
will have a material impact on the companys financial
position or results of operations.
note 14 fair value of financial
instruments
the carrying amounts reflected in the
consolidated balance sheet for cash and equivalents and notes
payable approximate fair value due to the short maturities. the
fair value of long-term debt is estimated using discounted cash
flow analyses, based on the companys incremental borrowing
rates for similar types of borrowing arrangements. the fair
value of the companys long-term debt, including current
portion, is approximately $723.9million, compared to a
carrying value of $681.2million at may31, 2002 and
$437.8million, compared to a carrying value of
$441.3million at may31, 2001.
note 15 financial risk management
and derivatives
as of may31, 2002, $50.9million of
deferred net losses (net of tax) on both outstanding and matured
derivatives accumulated in other comprehensive income are
expected to be reclassified to earnings during the next twelve
months as a result of underlying hedged transactions also being
recorded in earnings. actual amounts ultimately reclassified to
earnings are dependent on the exchange rates in effect when
derivative contracts that are currently outstanding mature. as
of may31, 2002, the maximum term over which the company is
hedging exposures to the variability of cash flows for all
forecasted and recorded transactions is 24months.
for the year ended may31, 2002 the company
recorded in other expense an insignificant loss representing the
total ineffectiveness of all derivatives. net income for the
year ended may31, 2002 was not materially affected due to
discontinued hedge accounting.
at may31, 2002, the fair values of
derivatives in a gain position and recorded in prepaid expenses
and other current assets and deferred income taxes and other
assets were $60.3million and $70.0million,
respectively. at this same date, the fair values of derivatives
in a loss position and recorded in accrued liabilities and
deferred income taxes and other liabilities were
$123.8million and $8.1million, respectively.
prior to the adoption of fas 133 carrying values
of derivatives recorded on the balance sheet were different from
fair values. accordingly, the aggregate notional principle
amounts, carrying values and fair

carrying values primarily represent amounts
recognized for unrealized gains and losses on contracts which
did not meet the criteria for deferral accounting and
unamortized premiums paid on option contracts. the net fair
value of outstanding forward contracts of $51.7million as
of may31, 2001 was comprised of unrealized fair value
losses of $22.9million and unrealized fair value gains of
$74.6million.
the company is exposed to credit-related losses
in the event of non-performance by counterparties to hedging
instruments. the counterparties to all derivative transactions
are major financial institutions with investment grade credit
ratings. however, this does not eliminate the companys
exposure to credit risk with these institutions. this credit
risk is generally limited to the unrealized gains in such
contracts should any of these counterparties fail to perform as
contracted. to manage this risk, the company has established
strict counterparty credit guidelines which are continually
monitored and reported to senior management according to
prescribed guidelines. the company utilizes a portfolio of
financial institutions either headquartered or operating in the
same countries the company conducts its business. as a result of
the above considerations, the company considers the risk of
counterparty default to be minimal.
in addition to hedging instruments, the company
is subject to concentrations of credit risk associated with cash
and equivalents and accounts receivable. the company places cash
and equivalents with financial institutions with investment
grade credit ratings and, by policy, limits the amount of credit
exposure to any one financial institution. the company considers
its concentration risk related to accounts receivable to be
mitigated by the companys credit policy, the significance
of outstanding balances owed by each individual customer at any
point in time and the geographic dispersion of these customers.
note 16 operating segments and
related information
operating segments.
the companys major operating
segments are defined by geographic regions for subsidiaries
participating in nike brand sales activity. other as
shown below represents activity for cole-haan holdings, inc.,
bauer nike hockey, inc., nike ihm, inc., and hurley
international llc, which are immaterial for individual
disclosure. where applicable, corporate represents
items necessary to reconcile to the consolidated financial
statements, which generally include corporate activity and
corporate eliminations. the segments are evidence of the
structure of the companys internal organization. each nike
brand geographic segment operates predominantly in one industry:
the design, production, marketing and selling of sports and
fitness footwear, apparel, and equipment.
net revenues as shown below represent sales to
external customers for each segment. intercompany revenues have
been eliminated and are immaterial for separate disclosure. the
company evaluates performance of individual operating segments
based on management pre-tax income. on a consolidated basis,
this amount represents income before income taxes and cumulative
effect of accounting change as shown in the consolidated
statements of income. reconciling items for management pre-tax
income represent corporate

notes to consolidated financial
statements(continued)
costs that are not allocated to the operating
segments for management reporting, and intercompany eliminations
for specific income statement items.
additions to long-lived assets as presented
following represent capital expenditures and additions to
identifiable intangibles and goodwill. generally, amortization
of identifiable intangible assets and goodwill is considered a
corporate expense and is not attributable to any specific
operating segment. see note1 for further discussion on
identifiable intangible assets and goodwill. additions to other
long-lived assets are not significant and are comprised of
additions to miscellaneous corporate assets not attributable to
any specific operating segment.
accounts receivable, inventory and property,
plant and equipment for operating segments are regularly
reviewed by management and are therefore provided below.
