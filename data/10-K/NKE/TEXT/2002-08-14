ITEM 1.

BUSINESS

GENERAL

NIKE, INC. WAS INCORPORATED IN 1968 UNDER THE

LAWS OF THE STATE OF OREGON. AS USED IN THIS REPORT, THE TERMS

WE, US, NIKE AND THE

COMPANY REFER TO NIKE, INC. AND ITS PREDECESSORS,

SUBSIDIARIES AND AFFILIATES, UNLESS THE CONTEXT INDICATES

OTHERWISE.

OUR PRINCIPAL BUSINESS ACTIVITY INVOLVES THE

DESIGN, DEVELOPMENT AND WORLDWIDE MARKETING OF HIGH QUALITY

FOOTWEAR, APPAREL, EQUIPMENT, AND ACCESSORY PRODUCTS. NIKE IS

THE LARGEST SELLER OF ATHLETIC FOOTWEAR AND ATHLETIC APPAREL IN

THE WORLD. WE SELL OUR PRODUCTS TO APPROXIMATELY

18,000 RETAIL ACCOUNTS IN THE UNITED STATES AND THROUGH A

MIX OF INDEPENDENT DISTRIBUTORS, LICENSEES AND SUBSIDIARIES IN

APPROXIMATELY 140 COUNTRIES AROUND THE WORLD. VIRTUALLY ALL

OF OUR PRODUCTS ARE MANUFACTURED BY INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS.

VIRTUALLY ALL FOOTWEAR PRODUCTS ARE PRODUCED OUTSIDE THE UNITED

STATES, WHILE APPAREL PRODUCTS ARE PRODUCED BOTH IN THE UNITED

STATES AND ABROAD.

PRODUCTS

NIKES ATHLETIC FOOTWEAR PRODUCTS ARE

DESIGNED PRIMARILY FOR SPECIFIC ATHLETIC USE, ALTHOUGH A LARGE

PERCENTAGE OF THE PRODUCTS ARE WORN FOR CASUAL OR LEISURE

PURPOSES. WE PLACE CONSIDERABLE EMPHASIS ON HIGH QUALITY

CONSTRUCTION AND INNOVATIVE DESIGN. RUNNING, BASKETBALL,

CHILDRENS, CROSS-TRAINING AND WOMENS SHOES ARE

CURRENTLY OUR TOP-SELLING PRODUCT CATEGORIES AND WE EXPECT THEM

TO CONTINUE TO LEAD IN PRODUCT SALES IN THE NEAR FUTURE.

HOWEVER, WE ALSO MARKET SHOES DESIGNED FOR OUTDOOR ACTIVITIES,

TENNIS, GOLF, SOCCER, BASEBALL, FOOTBALL, BICYCLING, VOLLEYBALL,

WRESTLING, CHEERLEADING, AQUATIC ACTIVITIES, HIKING, AND OTHER

ATHLETIC AND RECREATIONAL USES.

WE SELL ACTIVE SPORTS APPAREL COVERING MOST OF

THE ABOVE CATEGORIES, ATHLETICALLY INSPIRED LIFESTYLE APPAREL,

AS WELL AS ATHLETIC BAGS AND ACCESSORY ITEMS. NIKE APPAREL AND

ACCESSORIES ARE DESIGNED TO COMPLEMENT OUR ATHLETIC FOOTWEAR

PRODUCTS, FEATURE THE SAME TRADEMARKS AND ARE SOLD THROUGH THE

SAME MARKETING AND DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS. WE OFTEN MARKET

FOOTWEAR, APPAREL AND ACCESSORIES IN COLLECTIONS OF

SIMILAR DESIGN OR FOR SPECIFIC PURPOSES. WE ALSO MARKET APPAREL

WITH LICENSED COLLEGE AND PROFESSIONAL TEAM AND LEAGUE LOGOS.

WE SELL A LINE OF PERFORMANCE EQUIPMENT UNDER THE

NIKE BRAND NAME, INCLUDING SPORT BALLS, TIMEPIECES, EYEWEAR,

SKATES, BATS, GLOVES, AND OTHER EQUIPMENT DESIGNED FOR SPORTS

ACTIVITIES. WE ALSO HAVE AGREEMENTS FOR LICENSEES TO PRODUCE AND

SELL NIKE BRAND SWIMWEAR, WOMENS SPORTS BRAS, CYCLING

APPAREL, CHILDRENS CLOTHING, POSTERS, SCHOOL SUPPLIES,

TIMEPIECES, AND ELECTRONIC MEDIA DEVICES. WE ALSO SELL SMALL

AMOUNTS OF VARIOUS PLASTIC PRODUCTS TO OTHER MANUFACTURERS

THROUGH OUR WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARY, NIKE IHM, INC.

WE SELL A LINE OF DRESS AND CASUAL FOOTWEAR AND

ACCESSORIES FOR MEN, WOMEN AND CHILDREN UNDER THE BRAND NAME

COLE HAAN® THROUGH OUR WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARY, COLE HAAN

HOLDINGS, INC., HEADQUARTERED IN YARMOUTH, MAINE.

OUR WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARY, BAUER NIKE HOCKEY

INC., HEADQUARTERED IN GREENLAND, NEW HAMPSHIRE, MANUFACTURES

AND DISTRIBUTES ICE SKATES, SKATE BLADES, IN-LINE ROLLER SKATES,

PROTECTIVE GEAR, HOCKEY STICKS, AND HOCKEY JERSEYS AND

ACCESSORIES UNDER THE BAUER® AND NIKE® BRAND NAMES.

BAUER ALSO OFFERS A FULL SELECTION OF PRODUCTS FOR STREET,

ROLLER AND FIELD HOCKEY.

IN APRIL 2002, WE ACQUIRED HURLEY INTERNATIONAL

LLC, HEADQUARTERED IN COSTA MESA, CALIFORNIA, WHICH DESIGNS AND

DISTRIBUTES A LINE OF ACTION SPORTS APPAREL (FOR SURFING,

SKATEBOARDING, AND SNOWBOARDING) AND YOUTH LIFESTYLE APPAREL

UNDER THE HURLEY BRAND NAME.

FINANCIAL INFORMATION ABOUT GEOGRAPHIC AND

SEGMENT OPERATIONS APPEARS IN NOTE 16 OF THE CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ON PAGE 51.

WE EXPERIENCE MODERATE FLUCTUATIONS IN AGGREGATE

SALES VOLUME DURING THE YEAR. HOWEVER, THE MIX OF PRODUCT SALES

MAY VARY CONSIDERABLY FROM TIME TO TIME AS A RESULT OF CHANGES

IN SEASONAL AND GEOGRAPHIC DEMAND FOR PARTICULAR TYPES OF

FOOTWEAR, APPAREL, AND EQUIPMENT.

BECAUSE NIKE IS A CONSUMER PRODUCTS COMPANY, THE

RELATIVE POPULARITY OF VARIOUS SPORTS AND FITNESS ACTIVITIES AND

CHANGING DESIGN TRENDS AFFECT THE DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS. WE

MUST THEREFORE RESPOND TO TRENDS AND SHIFTS IN CONSUMER

PREFERENCES BY ADJUSTING THE MIX OF EXISTING PRODUCT OFFERINGS,

DEVELOPING NEW PRODUCTS, STYLES AND CATEGORIES, AND INFLUENCING

SPORTS AND FITNESS PREFERENCES THROUGH AGGRESSIVE MARKETING.

THIS IS A CONTINUING RISK. FAILURE TO TIMELY AND ADEQUATELY

RESPOND COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE AFFECT ON OUR SALES AND

PROFITABILITY.

UNITED STATES MARKET

DURING FISCAL 2002, SALES IN THE UNITED STATES

ACCOUNTED FOR APPROXIMATELY 53 PERCENT OF TOTAL REVENUES,

COMPARED TO 54 PERCENT IN FISCAL 2001 AND 56 PERCENT IN

FISCAL 2000. WE SELL TO APPROXIMATELY 18,000 RETAIL

ACCOUNTS IN THE UNITED STATES. THE NIKE BRAND DOMESTIC RETAIL

ACCOUNT BASE INCLUDES A MIX OF FOOTWEAR STORES, SPORTING GOODS

STORES, ATHLETIC SPECIALTY STORES, DEPARTMENT STORES, SKATE,

TENNIS AND GOLF SHOPS, AND OTHER RETAIL ACCOUNTS. DURING FISCAL

YEAR 2002, OUR THREE LARGEST CUSTOMERS ACCOUNTED FOR

APPROXIMATELY 28 PERCENT OF NIKE BRAND SALES IN THE UNITED

STATES, AND 26 PERCENT OF TOTAL SALES IN THE UNITED STATES.

WE MAKE SUBSTANTIAL USE OF OUR

FUTURES ORDERING PROGRAM, WHICH ALLOWS RETAILERS TO

ORDER FIVE TO SIX MONTHS IN ADVANCE OF DELIVERY WITH THE

GUARANTEE THAT 90 PERCENT OF THEIR ORDERS WILL BE DELIVERED

WITHIN A SET TIME PERIOD AT A FIXED PRICE. IN FISCAL YEAR 2002,

92 PERCENT OF OUR U.S. FOOTWEAR SHIPMENTS (EXCLUDING COLE

HAAN, BAUER AND HURLEY) WERE MADE UNDER THE FUTURES PROGRAM,

COMPARED TO 86 PERCENT IN FISCAL 2001 AND 90 PERCENT

IN FISCAL 2000. IN FISCAL 2002, 77 PERCENT OF OUR

U.S. APPAREL SHIPMENTS WERE MADE UNDER THE FUTURES PROGRAM,

COMPARED TO 78 PERCENT IN FISCAL 2001, AND 82 PERCENT

IN 2000.

WE UTILIZE 18 NIKE SALES OFFICES TO SOLICIT SALES

IN THE UNITED STATES. WE ALSO UTILIZE 15 INDEPENDENT SALES

REPRESENTATIVES TO SELL SPECIALTY PRODUCTS FOR GOLF, CYCLING,

WATER SPORTS AND OUTDOOR ACTIVITIES. IN ADDITION, WE OPERATE THE

INTERNATIONAL MARKETS

WE CURRENTLY MARKET OUR PRODUCTS IN APPROXIMATELY

NON-U.S. SALES ACCOUNTED FOR 47 PERCENT OF TOTAL REVENUES

IN FISCAL 2002, COMPARED TO 46 PERCENT IN FISCAL 2001 AND

44 PERCENT IN FISCAL 2000. WE OPERATE 19 DISTRIBUTION

CENTERS IN EUROPE, ASIA, AUSTRALIA, LATIN AMERICA, AND CANADA,

AND ALSO DISTRIBUTE THROUGH INDEPENDENT DISTRIBUTORS AND

LICENSEES. WE ESTIMATE THAT OUR PRODUCTS ARE SOLD THROUGH MORE

THAN 30,000 RETAIL ACCOUNTS OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES. IN MANY

COUNTRIES AND REGIONS, INCLUDING JAPAN, CANADA, ASIA, LATIN

AMERICA, AND EUROPE, WE HAVE A FUTURES ORDERING PROGRAM FOR

RETAILERS SIMILAR TO THE UNITED STATES FUTURES PROGRAM DESCRIBED

ABOVE. NIKES THREE LARGEST CUSTOMERS OUTSIDE OF THE U.S.

ACCOUNTED FOR APPROXIMATELY 9 PERCENT OF NON-U.S. SALES.

SIGNIFICANT CUSTOMERS

FOOT LOCKER, INC., WHICH OPERATES A CHAIN OF

RETAIL STORES SPECIALIZING IN ATHLETIC FOOTWEAR AND APPAREL,

ACCOUNTED FOR APPROXIMATELY 11 PERCENT OF GLOBAL NET SALES OF

NIKE BRAND PRODUCTS DURING FISCAL 2002. NO OTHER CUSTOMER

ACCOUNTED FOR 10 PERCENT OR MORE OF OUR NET SALES DURING FISCAL

2002.

ORDERS

AS OF MAY 31, 2002, OUR WORLDWIDE FUTURES

ORDERS FOR NIKE BRAND ATHLETIC FOOTWEAR AND APPAREL TOTALED

$4.6 BILLION, COMPARED TO $4.4 BILLION AS OF

MAY 31, 2001. THESE ORDERS ARE SCHEDULED FOR DELIVERY FROM

JUNE THROUGH NOVEMBER OF 2002. BASED UPON HISTORICAL DATA, WE

EXPECT THAT APPROXIMATELY 95 PERCENT OF THESE ORDERS WILL BE

FILLED IN THAT TIME PERIOD, ALTHOUGH THE ORDERS MAY BE

CANCELABLE.

PRODUCT RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

WE BELIEVE THAT OUR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

EFFORTS ARE A KEY FACTOR IN OUR PAST AND FUTURE SUCCESS.

TECHNICAL INNOVATION IN THE DESIGN OF FOOTWEAR, APPAREL, AND

ATHLETIC EQUIPMENT RECEIVE CONTINUED EMPHASIS AS NIKE STRIVES TO

PRODUCE PRODUCTS THAT REDUCE OR ELIMINATE INJURY, AID ATHLETIC

PERFORMANCE AND MAXIMIZE COMFORT.

IN ADDITION TO NIKES OWN STAFF OF

SPECIALISTS IN THE AREAS OF BIOMECHANICS, EXERCISE PHYSIOLOGY,

ENGINEERING, INDUSTRIAL DESIGN AND RELATED FIELDS, WE ALSO

UTILIZE RESEARCH COMMITTEES AND ADVISORY BOARDS MADE UP OF

ATHLETES, COACHES, TRAINERS, EQUIPMENT MANAGERS, ORTHOPEDISTS,

PODIATRISTS AND OTHER EXPERTS WHO CONSULT WITH US AND REVIEW

DESIGNS, MATERIALS AND CONCEPTS FOR PRODUCT IMPROVEMENT.

EMPLOYEE ATHLETES WEAR-TEST AND EVALUATE PRODUCTS DURING THE

DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT PROCESS.

MANUFACTURING

IN FISCAL 2002, APPROXIMATELY 5 PERCENT OF TOTAL

NIKE BRAND APPAREL PRODUCTION FOR SALE TO THE UNITED STATES

MARKET WAS MANUFACTURED IN THE UNITED STATES BY INDEPENDENT

CONTRACT MANUFACTURERS, MOST OF WHICH ARE LOCATED IN THE

SOUTHERN STATES. THE REMAINDER WAS MANUFACTURED BY INDEPENDENT

CONTRACTORS LOCATED IN 28 COUNTRIES. MOST OF THIS APPAREL

PRODUCTION OCCURRED IN BANGLADESH, BULGARIA, CHINA, HONG KONG,

INDIA, INDONESIA, MALAYSIA, MEXICO, PAKISTAN, THE PHILIPPINES,

SRI LANKA, TAIWAN, THAILAND, AND TURKEY. SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF

OUR APPAREL PRODUCTION FOR SALE TO THE INTERNATIONAL MARKET WAS

MANUFACTURED OUTSIDE THE U.S. OUR LARGEST SINGLE APPAREL

SUPPLIER ACCOUNTED FOR APPROXIMATELY 8 PERCENT OF TOTAL FISCAL

2002 APPAREL PRODUCTION.

VIRTUALLY ALL OF OUR FOOTWEAR IS PRODUCED OUTSIDE

OF THE UNITED STATES. IN FISCAL 2002, CONTRACT SUPPLIERS IN THE

FOLLOWING COUNTRIES MANUFACTURED THE FOLLOWING PERCENTAGES OF

WE ALSO HAVE MANUFACTURING AGREEMENTS WITH

THOSE COUNTRIES. OUR LARGEST SINGLE FOOTWEAR SUPPLIER ACCOUNTED

FOR APPROXIMATELY 6 PERCENT OF TOTAL FISCAL 2002 FOOTWEAR

PRODUCTION.

THE PRINCIPAL MATERIALS USED IN OUR FOOTWEAR

PRODUCTS ARE NATURAL AND SYNTHETIC RUBBER, PLASTIC COMPOUNDS,

FOAM CUSHIONING MATERIALS, NYLON, LEATHER, CANVAS, AND

POLYURETHANE FILMS USED TO MAKE AIR-SOLE CUSHIONING COMPONENTS.

NIKE IHM, INC., A WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARY OF NIKE, IS OUR SOLE

SUPPLIER OF THE AIR-SOLE CUSHIONING COMPONENTS USED IN FOOTWEAR.

THE PRINCIPAL MATERIALS USED IN OUR

5

TABLE OF CONTENTS

APPAREL PRODUCTS ARE NATURAL AND SYNTHETIC

FABRICS AND THREADS, PLASTIC AND METAL HARDWARE, AND SPECIALIZED

PERFORMANCE FABRICS DESIGNED TO REPEL RAIN, RETAIN HEAT, OR

EFFICIENTLY TRANSPORT BODY MOISTURE. NIKE AND ITS CONTRACTORS

AND SUPPLIERS BUY RAW MATERIALS IN BULK. MOST RAW MATERIALS ARE

AVAILABLE IN THE COUNTRIES WHERE MANUFACTURING TAKES PLACE. WE

HAVE THUS FAR EXPERIENCED LITTLE DIFFICULTY IN SATISFYING OUR

RAW MATERIAL REQUIREMENTS.

OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS ARE SUBJECT TO THE

USUAL RISKS OF DOING BUSINESS ABROAD, SUCH AS POSSIBLE

REVALUATION OF CURRENCIES, EXPORT DUTIES, QUOTAS, RESTRICTIONS

ON THE TRANSFER OF FUNDS AND, IN CERTAIN PARTS OF THE WORLD,

POLITICAL INSTABILITY. SEE TRADE LEGISLATION BELOW.

WE HAVE NOT, TO DATE, BEEN MATERIALLY AFFECTED BY ANY SUCH RISK,

BUT CANNOT PREDICT THE LIKELIHOOD OF SUCH DEVELOPMENTS

OCCURRING. WE BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO DEVELOP, OVER

A PERIOD OF TIME, ADEQUATE ALTERNATIVE SOURCES OF SUPPLY FOR THE

PRODUCTS OBTAINED FROM OUR PRESENT SUPPLIERS OUTSIDE OF THE

UNITED STATES. IF EVENTS PREVENTED US FROM ACQUIRING PRODUCTS

FROM OUR SUPPLIERS IN A PARTICULAR COUNTRY, OUR FOOTWEAR

OPERATIONS COULD BE TEMPORARILY DISRUPTED AND WE COULD

EXPERIENCE AN ADVERSE FINANCIAL IMPACT. HOWEVER, WE BELIEVE THAT

WE COULD ELIMINATE ANY SUCH DISRUPTION WITHIN A PERIOD OF NO

MORE THAN 12 MONTHS, AND THAT ANY ADVERSE IMPACT WOULD,

THEREFORE, BE OF A SHORT-TERM NATURE. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR

PRINCIPAL COMPETITORS ARE SUBJECT TO SIMILAR RISKS.

ALL OF OUR PRODUCTS MANUFACTURED OVERSEAS AND

IMPORTED INTO THE UNITED STATES AND OTHER COUNTRIES ARE SUBJECT

TO CUSTOMS DUTIES COLLECTED BY CUSTOMS AUTHORITIES. CUSTOMS

INFORMATION SUBMITTED BY US IS ROUTINELY SUBJECT TO REVIEW BY

CUSTOMS AUTHORITIES. WE ARE UNABLE TO PREDICT WHETHER ADDITIONAL

CUSTOMS DUTIES, QUOTAS OR OTHER RESTRICTIONS MAY BE IMPOSED ON

THE IMPORTATION OF OUR PRODUCTS IN THE FUTURE. THE ENACTMENT OF

ANY SUCH DUTIES, QUOTAS OR RESTRICTIONS COULD RESULT IN

INCREASES IN THE COST OF OUR PRODUCTS GENERALLY AND MIGHT

ADVERSELY AFFECT THE SALES OR PROFITABILITY OF NIKE AND THE

IMPORTED FOOTWEAR AND APPAREL INDUSTRY AS A WHOLE.

SINCE 1972, NISSHO IWAI AMERICAN CORPORATION

(NIAC), A SUBSIDIARY OF NISSHO IWAI CORPORATION, A

LARGE JAPANESE TRADING COMPANY, HAS PERFORMED SIGNIFICANT

IMPORT-EXPORT FINANCING SERVICES FOR US. CURRENTLY, NIAC

PROVIDES SUCH FINANCING SERVICES WITH RESPECT TO AT LEAST 80

PERCENT OF THE NIKE PRODUCTS SOLD OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES,

EUROPE AND JAPAN. ANY FAILURE OF NIAC TO PROVIDE THESE SERVICES

COULD DISRUPT OUR ABILITY TO ACQUIRE PRODUCTS FROM OUR SUPPLIERS

AND TO DELIVER PRODUCTS TO OUR CUSTOMERS OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED

STATES, EUROPE AND JAPAN. SUCH A DISRUPTION COULD RESULT IN

CANCELLED ORDERS THAT WOULD ADVERSELY AFFECT SALES AND

PROFITABILITY. HOWEVER, WE BELIEVE THAT ANY SUCH DISRUPTION

WOULD BE SHORT TERM IN DURATION DUE TO THE READY AVAILABILITY OF

ALTERNATIVE SOURCES OF FINANCING AT COMPETITIVE RATES. OUR

CURRENT AGREEMENTS WITH NIAC EXPIRE ON MAY 31, 2003.

TRADE LEGISLATION

OUR NON-U.S. OPERATIONS ARE SUBJECT TO THE USUAL

RISKS OF DOING BUSINESS ABROAD, SUCH AS THE IMPOSITION OF IMPORT

QUOTAS OR ANTI-DUMPING DUTIES. IN 1994, THE EUROPEAN UNION

(EU) COMMISSION IMPOSED QUOTAS ON CERTAIN TYPES OF

FOOTWEAR MANUFACTURED IN CHINA. THESE QUOTAS REPLACED NATIONAL

QUOTAS THAT HAD PREVIOUSLY BEEN IN EFFECT IN SEVERAL MEMBER

STATES. FOOTWEAR DESIGNED FOR USE IN SPORTING ACTIVITIES,

MEETING CERTAIN TECHNICAL CRITERIA AND HAVING A CIF (COST,

INSURANCE AND FREIGHT) PRICE ABOVE 9 EUROS (SPECIAL

TECHNOLOGY ATHLETIC FOOTWEAR OR STAF), IS

EXCLUDED FROM THE QUOTAS. AS A RESULT OF THE STAF EXCLUSION, AND

THE AMOUNT OF QUOTA MADE AVAILABLE TO US, THE QUOTAS HAVE NOT,

TO DATE, HAD A MATERIAL EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS.

IN 1995, THE EU COMMISSION, AT THE REQUEST OF

EUROPEAN FOOTWEAR MANUFACTURERS, INITIATED TWO ANTI-DUMPING

INVESTIGATIONS COVERING FOOTWEAR IMPORTED FROM THE PEOPLES

REPUBLIC OF CHINA, INDONESIA AND THAILAND. AS A RESULT, IN 1997

THE COMMISSION IMPOSED DEFINITIVE ANTI-DUMPING DUTIES ON CERTAIN

TEXTILE UPPER FOOTWEAR IMPORTED FROM CHINA AND INDONESIA. IN

1998, THE COMMISSION IMPOSED DEFINITIVE ANTI-DUMPING DUTIES ON

CERTAIN SYNTHETIC AND LEATHER UPPER FOOTWEAR ORIGINATING IN

CHINA, INDONESIA AND THAILAND. IN THE CASE OF TEXTILE UPPER

FOOTWEAR, THE ANTI-DUMPING DUTIES DO NOT COVER SPORTS FOOTWEAR.

IN THE CASE OF SYNTHETIC AND LEATHER UPPER FOOTWEAR, THE

ANTI-DUMPING DUTIES DO NOT COVER FOOTWEAR MEETING THE STAF

TECHNICAL CRITERIA NOR FOOTWEAR WITH A CIF PRICE ABOVE 5.7

EUROS. AS THE ANTI-DUMPING DUTIES FOR SYNTHETIC AND LEATHER

UPPERS ONLY AFFECT SOME LOW COST FOOTWEAR, THESE MEASURES HAVE

NO IMPACT FOR US. WHILE THE EXCLUSIONS ARE SUBJECT TO SOME

INTERPRETATION BY CUSTOMS AUTHORITIES, WE BELIEVE THAT MOST OF

OUR FOOTWEAR SOURCED IN THE TARGET COUNTRIES FOR SALE IN THE EU

FITS WITHIN THE EXCLUSIONS. WE HAVE ALSO SHIFTED THE PRODUCTION

OF THESE TYPES

6

TABLE OF CONTENTS

OF FOOTWEAR TO OTHER COUNTRIES. ACCORDINGLY, THE

ANTI-DUMPING DUTIES HAVE NOT HAD A MATERIAL EFFECT ON OUR

BUSINESS. THE EU COMMISSION HAS ANNOUNCED THE IMPENDING

EXPIRATION OF THESE ANTI-DUMPING CASES, SUBJECT TO POSSIBLE

REVIEW REQUESTS BY THE EUROPEAN FOOTWEAR MANUFACTURERS. SUCH

REVIEWS MAY RESULT IN THE RENEWAL OF THE ANTI-DUMPING

REGULATIONS.

THE EU COMMISSION IN JUNE 2000 ISSUED AN

AMENDMENT TO THE EXPLANATORY NOTES TO THE EUS CUSTOMS

NOMENCLATURE (CN). THE AMENDMENT, WHICH IS NOT

LEGALLY BINDING, INTERPRETS SOME OF THE TECHNICAL CRITERIA FOR

THE STAF EXCLUSION AND THE FOOTWEAR TYPES THAT CAN BE CLASSIFIED

AS FOR USE IN SPORTING ACTIVITY. THE AMENDMENT RESTRICTS

SOMEWHAT THE SCOPE OF THE STAF EXCLUSION FROM THE QUOTAS AND

ALSO THE SPORTS FOOTWEAR EXCLUSIONS FROM THE TWO EU ANTI-DUMPING

MEASURES. TO DATE, THE LARGE MAJORITY OF OUR FOOTWEAR MODELS

FALL WITHIN THE EXCLUSIONS PROVIDED FOR UNDER THE CN. OUR

INNOVATIVE FOOTWEAR DESIGNS MAY STRETCH THE TRADITIONAL CONCEPTS

OF ATHLETIC OR SPORTS FOOTWEAR REFLECTED IN THE TECHNICAL

CRITERIA. WE ANTICIPATE THAT THE MAJORITY OF THESE NEW DESIGNS

WILL FALL WITHIN THE EXCLUSIONS. NIKE IS AN ACTIVE PARTICIPANT

IN DISCUSSIONS TO REVISE THE TECHNICAL CRITERIA TO REFLECT

TECHNOLOGICALLY ADVANCED DESIGNS.

IF THE EU TRADE MEASURES BECOME SUBSTANTIALLY

MORE RESTRICTIVE WE WOULD CONSIDER SHIFTING THE PRODUCTION OF

SUCH FOOTWEAR TO OTHER COUNTRIES IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN

COMPETITIVE PRICING. WE BELIEVE THAT WE ARE PREPARED TO DEAL

EFFECTIVELY WITH ANY SUCH CHANGE OF CIRCUMSTANCES AND THAT ANY

ADVERSE IMPACT WOULD BE OF A TEMPORARY NATURE. WE CONTINUE TO

CLOSELY MONITOR INTERNATIONAL RESTRICTIONS AND MAINTAIN OUR

MULTI-COUNTRY SOURCING STRATEGY AND CONTINGENCY PLANS. WE

BELIEVE THAT OUR MAJOR COMPETITORS STAND IN MUCH THE SAME

POSITION REGARDING THESE TRADE MEASURES.

WE CURRENTLY SOURCE FOOTWEAR AND APPAREL PRODUCTS

FROM FACTORIES IN VIETNAM. IN JULY 2000, THE UNITED STATES AND

VIETNAM SIGNED AN HISTORIC, COMPREHENSIVE BILATERAL TRADE

AGREEMENT, WHICH, AMONG OTHER THINGS, PROVIDES RECIPROCAL,

NON-DISCRIMINATORY NORMAL TRADE RELATIONS (NTR)

BETWEEN THE TWO COUNTRIES. IN SEPTEMBER 2001, THAT AGREEMENT WAS

APPROVED BY CONGRESS AND THEN RATIFIED BY THE VIETNAMESE

NATIONAL ASSEMBLY. ONCE APPROVED, THE UNITED STATES GRANTED AN

ANNUAL EXTENSION OF NTR TO VIETNAM. UNDER CURRENT U.S. LAW, THE

PRESIDENT MUST RENEW THIS GRANT ANNUALLY WITH THE OPPORTUNITY

FOR REVIEW BY THE CONGRESS. IN JUNE 2002, PRESIDENT BUSH RENEWED

NTR FOR VIETNAM FOR AN ADDITIONAL YEAR AND IN JULY 2002, THE

CONGRESS SUPPORTED THE PRESIDENTS DECISION. WE CURRENTLY

BELIEVE THAT, ABSENT UNFORESEEN CIRCUMSTANCES, THE PRESIDENT

WILL CONTINUE HIS ANNUAL EXTENSIONS OF NTR TO VIETNAM AND THAT

CONGRESS WILL SUPPORT THE PRESIDENTS DECISIONS. ONGOING

NTR TRADING STATUS FOR VIETNAM WILL ALLOW US TO EXPAND OUR

PRODUCTION AND MARKETING OPPORTUNITIES IN VIETNAM AND ALLOW FOR

VIETNAMESE-SOURCED PRODUCT TO ENTER THE UNITED STATES AT NTR

TARIFF RATES.

COMPETITION

THE ATHLETIC FOOTWEAR, APPAREL AND EQUIPMENT

INDUSTRY IS KEENLY COMPETITIVE IN THE UNITED STATES AND ON A

WORLDWIDE BASIS. WE COMPETE INTERNATIONALLY WITH AN INCREASING

NUMBER OF ATHLETIC AND LEISURE SHOE COMPANIES, ATHLETIC AND

LEISURE APPAREL COMPANIES, SPORTS EQUIPMENT COMPANIES, AND LARGE

COMPANIES HAVING DIVERSIFIED LINES OF ATHLETIC AND LEISURE

SHOES, APPAREL AND EQUIPMENT, INCLUDING REEBOK, ADIDAS AND

OTHERS. THE INTENSE COMPETITION AND THE RAPID CHANGES IN

TECHNOLOGY AND CONSUMER PREFERENCES IN THE MARKETS FOR ATHLETIC

AND LEISURE FOOTWEAR AND APPAREL, AND ATHLETIC EQUIPMENT,

CONSTITUTE SIGNIFICANT RISK FACTORS IN OUR OPERATIONS.

NIKE IS THE LARGEST SELLER OF ATHLETIC FOOTWEAR

AND ATHLETIC APPAREL IN THE WORLD. PERFORMANCE AND RELIABILITY

OF SHOES, APPAREL, AND EQUIPMENT, NEW PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT,

PRICE, PRODUCT IDENTITY THROUGH MARKETING AND PROMOTION, AND

CUSTOMER SUPPORT AND SERVICE ARE IMPORTANT ASPECTS OF

COMPETITION IN THE ATHLETIC FOOTWEAR, APPAREL AND EQUIPMENT

INDUSTRY. TO HELP MARKET OUR PRODUCTS, WE CONTRACT WITH

PROMINENT AND INFLUENTIAL ATHLETES, COACHES, TEAMS, COLLEGES,

AND SPORTS LEAGUES TO ENDORSE OUR BRANDS AND USE OUR PRODUCTS,

AND WE ACTIVELY SPONSOR SPORTING EVENTS AND CLINICS. WE BELIEVE

THAT WE ARE COMPETITIVE IN ALL OF THESE AREAS.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

TRADEMARKS AND PATENTS

WE UTILIZE TRADEMARKS ON NEARLY ALL OF OUR

PRODUCTS AND BELIEVE THAT HAVING DISTINCTIVE MARKS THAT ARE

READILY IDENTIFIABLE IS AN IMPORTANT FACTOR IN CREATING A MARKET

FOR OUR GOODS, IN IDENTIFYING THE COMPANY, AND IN DISTINGUISHING

OUR GOODS FROM THE GOODS OF OTHERS. WE CONSIDER OUR NIKE®

AND SWOOSH DESIGN® TRADEMARKS TO BE AMONG OUR MOST VALUABLE

ASSETS AND WE HAVE REGISTERED THESE TRADEMARKS IN OVER

100 COUNTRIES. IN ADDITION, WE OWN MANY OTHER TRADEMARKS

WHICH WE UTILIZE IN MARKETING OUR PRODUCTS. WE CONTINUE TO

VIGOROUSLY PROTECT OUR TRADEMARKS AGAINST INFRINGEMENT.

NIKE HAS AN EXCLUSIVE, WORLDWIDE LICENSE TO MAKE

AND SELL FOOTWEAR USING PATENTED AIR TECHNOLOGY. THE

PROCESS UTILIZES PRESSURIZED GAS ENCAPSULATED IN POLYURETHANE.

SOME OF THE EARLY NIKE AIR® PATENTS HAVE EXPIRED,

WHICH MAY ENABLE COMPETITORS TO USE CERTAIN TYPES OF LIKE

TECHNOLOGY. SUBSEQUENT NIKE AIR PATENTS WILL NOT EXPIRE FOR

SEVERAL YEARS. WE ALSO HAVE A NUMBER OF PATENTS COVERING

COMPONENTS AND FEATURES USED IN VARIOUS ATHLETIC AND LEISURE

SHOES. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR SUCCESS DEPENDS PRIMARILY UPON SKILLS

IN DESIGN, RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, PRODUCTION AND MARKETING

RATHER THAN UPON OUR PATENT POSITION. HOWEVER, WE HAVE FOLLOWED

A POLICY OF FILING APPLICATIONS FOR UNITED STATES AND FOREIGN

PATENTS ON INVENTIONS, DESIGNS AND IMPROVEMENTS THAT WE DEEM

VALUABLE.

LEGAL

PROCEEDINGS

EXCEPT AS DESCRIBED BELOW, THERE ARE NO MATERIAL

PENDING LEGAL PROCEEDINGS, OTHER THAN ORDINARY ROUTINE

LITIGATION INCIDENTAL TO OUR BUSINESS, TO WHICH WE ARE A PARTY

OR OF WHICH ANY OF OUR PROPERTY IS THE SUBJECT.

THE COMPANY AND CERTAIN OF ITS OFFICERS AND

DIRECTORS WERE NAMED AS DEFENDANTS IN FOUR SUBSTANTIALLY

IDENTICAL SECURITIES CLASS ACTIONS FILED IN THE U.S. DISTRICT

COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF OREGON ON MARCH 9, 14, 20, AND

APRIL 4, 2001. ON JULY 23, 2001, THE CASES WERE

CONSOLIDATED AS IN RE NIKE, INC. SECURITIES LITIGATION,

CV-01-332-K. THE CONSOLIDATED AMENDED COMPLAINT SOUGHT

UNSPECIFIED DAMAGES ON BEHALF OF A PURPORTED CLASS CONSISTING OF

PURCHASERS OF THE COMPANYS STOCK DURING THE PERIOD

DECEMBER 20, 2000 THROUGH FEBRUARY 26, 2001.

PLAINTIFFS ALLEGE THAT THE DEFENDANTS MADE FALSE AND MISLEADING

STATEMENTS ABOUT THE COMPANYS ACTUAL AND EXPECTED BUSINESS

AND FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE IN VIOLATION OF FEDERAL SECURITIES

LAWS. PLAINTIFFS FURTHER ALLEGE THAT CERTAIN INDIVIDUAL

DEFENDANTS SOLD COMPANY STOCK WHILE IN POSSESSION OF MATERIAL

NON-PUBLIC INFORMATION. IN JANUARY 2002, THE COURT

DISMISSED THIS ACTION WITH LEAVE TO AMEND. ON FEBRUARY 25,

2002, PLAINTIFFS FILED AN AMENDED COMPLAINT EXTENDING THE

PURPORTED CLASS PERIOD TO JUNE 29, 2000 THROUGH

FEBRUARY 26, 2001 AND CONTAINING THE SAME ALLEGATIONS.

BASED ON THE AVAILABLE INFORMATION WE DO NOT CURRENTLY

ANTICIPATE THAT THE ACTION WILL HAVE A MATERIAL FINANCIAL

IMPACT. WE BELIEVE THE CLAIMS ARE WITHOUT MERIT, AND WE INTEND

TO VIGOROUSLY DEFEND AGAINST THEM.

A RELATED SHAREHOLDER DERIVATIVE LAWSUIT,

METIVIER V. DENUNZIO, ET AL., 0104-04339, WAS FILED IN THE

MULTNOMAH COUNTY CIRCUIT COURT OF THE STATE OF OREGON ON

APRIL 26, 2001. THE STATE DERIVATIVE SUIT WAS BROUGHT BY

CERTAIN COMPANY SHAREHOLDERS, ALLEGEDLY ON BEHALF OF THE

COMPANY, AGAINST CERTAIN DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS OF THE COMPANY.

THE DERIVATIVE PLAINTIFFS ALLEGE THAT THESE OFFICERS AND

DIRECTORS BREACHED THEIR

10

TABLE OF CONTENTS

FIDUCIARY DUTIES TO THE COMPANY BY MAKING OR

CAUSING TO BE MADE ALLEGED MISSTATEMENTS ABOUT THE

COMPANYS ACTUAL AND EXPECTED FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE WHILE

CERTAIN OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS SOLD COMPANY STOCK AND BY

ALLOWING THE COMPANY TO BE SUED IN THE SHAREHOLDER CLASS ACTION.

THE DERIVATIVE PLAINTIFFS SEEK COMPENSATORY AND OTHER DAMAGES,

AND DISGORGEMENT OF COMPENSATION RECEIVED. ON JULY 25,

2001, THE COURT ENTERED A STIPULATION AND ORDER ABATING THE

ACTION UNTIL FURTHER NOTICE.

ANOTHER RELATED SHAREHOLDER DERIVATIVE LAWSUIT,

LENDMAN V. KNIGHT, ET AL., CV-01-1153-AS, WAS FILED IN THE

U.S. DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF OREGON ON JULY 26,

2001. THE FEDERAL DERIVATIVE SUIT IS NOT MATERIALLY DIFFERENT

FROM THE STATE DERIVATIVE ACTION. IT ALLEGES SUBSTANTIALLY

SIMILAR CAUSES OF ACTION AND SEEKS SUBSTANTIALLY SIMILAR

REMEDIES. THE FEDERAL DERIVATIVE ACTION WAS SERVED ON THE

COMPANY AND THE INDIVIDUAL DEFENDANTS ON DECEMBER 13, 2001

AND WAS ALSO STAYED PENDING THE OUTCOME OF IN RE NIKE, INC.

SECURITIES LITIGATION ON DECEMBER 13, 2001.

IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE COMPANYS ARTICLES OF

INCORPORATION AND BYLAWS, AND IN ACCORDANCE WITH INDEMNITY

AGREEMENTS BETWEEN THE COMPANY AND THE DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS

NAMED IN THE ABOVE LEGAL ACTIONS, THE COMPANY HAS AGREED TO

INDEMNIFY THESE INDIVIDUALS AND ASSUME THEIR DEFENSE IN THE

ACTIONS.

THE COMPANY AND CERTAIN OF ITS OFFICERS WERE

NAMED AS DEFENDANTS IN AN LAWSUIT, KASKY V. NIKE, INC. ET AL.,

NO. 994446, FILED IN 1998 IN SAN FRANCISCO COUNTY SUPERIOR

COURT. PLAINTIFF BROUGHT THE ACTION UNDER THE CALIFORNIA

BUSINESS AND PROFESSIONS CODE ALLEGING THAT STATEMENTS MADE BY

THE COMPANY IN RESPONSE TO CRITICISM ABOUT LABOR PRACTICES IN

FACTORIES MAKING ITS PRODUCTS WERE FALSE OR MISLEADING.

PLAINTIFF SEEKS INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND RESTITUTION OF PROFITS

EARNED FROM THE ALLEGED VIOLATIONS OF THE CALIFORNIA CODE. THE

CLAIMS WERE DISMISSED BY THE SUPERIOR COURT, WITH THE COURT

CONCLUDING THAT THE ALLEGED STATEMENTS, IF MADE, WERE PROTECTED

SPEECH AS PART OF A PUBLIC DEBATE UNDER THE FIRST AMENDMENT TO

THE UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION. PLAINTIFF APPEALED THE SUPERIOR

COURT RULING TO THE CALIFORNIA COURT OF APPEALS, WHICH COURT

AFFIRMED THE RULING OF THE LOWER COURT. PLAINTIFF SOUGHT REVIEW

IN THE CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT, WHICH, ON MAY 2, 2002,

OVERTURNED THE LOWER COURT RULINGS BY A FOUR TO THREE VOTE. THE

CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT MADE NO RULING ON THE MERITS OF

PLAINTIFFS CONTENTION THAT THE COMPANY HAD MADE FALSE OR

MISLEADING STATEMENTS, BUT CONCLUDED THAT THE ALLEGED STATEMENTS

WERE COMMERCIAL SPEECH AND NOT ENTITLED TO THE FULL PROTECTION

OF THE FIRST AMENDMENT OF THE UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION. THE

COMPANY FILED A PETITION FOR REHEARING BEFORE THE CALIFORNIA

SUPREME COURT, WHICH WAS DENIED ON JULY 31, 2002. THE CASE

HAS BEEN REMANDED TO THE LOWER CALIFORNIA STATE COURTS FOR

FURTHER PROCEEDINGS. WE HAVE ANNOUNCED OUR INTENTION TO SEEK

REVIEW BY THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT AND HAVE ENGAGED

ADDITIONAL COUNSEL FOR THAT SPECIFIC PURPOSE. SINCE THE

LITIGATION IS IN A PRELIMINARY STAGE, WE DO NOT CURRENTLY

ANTICIPATE THAT THE ACTION WILL HAVE A MATERIAL FINANCIAL

IMPACT. WE BELIEVE THAT THE CLAIMS ARE WITHOUT MERIT AND WE

INTEND TO VIGOROUSLY DEFEND AGAINST THEM.

MANAGEMENTS

DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

OUR DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF OUR FINANCIAL

CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOLLOWING ARE BASED UPON OUR

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, WHICH HAVE BEEN PREPARED IN

ACCORDANCE WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES

13

TABLE OF CONTENTS

GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES. THE

PREPARATION OF THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS REQUIRES US TO MAKE

ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS THAT AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF

ASSETS, LIABILITIES, REVENUES AND EXPENSES, AND RELATED

DISCLOSURE OF CONTINGENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES.

WE BELIEVE THAT THE ESTIMATES, ASSUMPTIONS AND

JUDGMENTS INVOLVED IN THE ACCOUNTING POLICIES DESCRIBED BELOW

HAVE THE GREATEST POTENTIAL IMPACT ON OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS,

SO WE CONSIDER THESE TO BE OUR CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES.

BECAUSE OF THE UNCERTAINTY INHERENT IN THESE MATTERS, ACTUAL

RESULTS COULD DIFFER FROM THE ESTIMATES WE USE IN APPLYING THE

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES. CERTAIN OF THESE CRITICAL

ACCOUNTING POLICIES AFFECT WORKING CAPITAL ACCOUNT BALANCES,

INCLUDING THE POLICIES FOR REVENUE RECOGNITION, THE RESERVE FOR

UNCOLLECTIBLE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, INVENTORY RESERVES, AND

CONTINGENT PAYMENTS UNDER ENDORSEMENT CONTRACTS. THESE POLICIES

REQUIRE THAT WE MAKE ESTIMATES IN THE PREPARATION OF OUR

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AS OF A GIVEN DATE. HOWEVER, SINCE OUR

BUSINESS CYCLE IS RELATIVELY SHORT, ACTUAL RESULTS RELATED TO

THESE ESTIMATES ARE GENERALLY KNOWN WITHIN THE SIX-MONTH PERIOD

FOLLOWING THE FINANCIAL STATEMENT DATE. THUS, THESE POLICIES

GENERALLY AFFECT ONLY THE TIMING OF REPORTED AMOUNTS ACROSS TWO

TO THREE QUARTERS.

WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF THESE CRITICAL ACCOUNTING

POLICIES, WE ARE NOT CURRENTLY AWARE OF ANY REASONABLY LIKELY

EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH WOULD RESULT IN MATERIALLY

DIFFERENT AMOUNTS BEING REPORTED.

REVENUE RECOGNITION

WE RECORD WHOLESALE REVENUES WHEN TITLE PASSES

AND THE RISKS AND REWARDS OF OWNERSHIP HAVE PASSED TO THE

CUSTOMER, BASED ON THE TERMS OF SALE. TITLE PASSES GENERALLY

UPON SHIPMENT OR UPON RECEIPT BY THE CUSTOMER DEPENDING ON THE

COUNTRY OF THE SALE AND THE AGREEMENT WITH THE CUSTOMER. RETAIL

STORE REVENUES ARE RECORDED AT THE TIME OF SALE.

IN SOME INSTANCES, WE SHIP PRODUCT DIRECTLY FROM

OUR SUPPLIER TO THE CUSTOMER. IN THESE CASES, WE RECOGNIZE

REVENUE WHEN THE PRODUCT IS DELIVERED TO THE CUSTOMER. OUR

REVENUES MAY FLUCTUATE IN CASES WHEN OUR CUSTOMERS DELAY

ACCEPTING SHIPMENT OF PRODUCT FOR PERIODS UP TO SEVERAL WEEKS.

IN CERTAIN COUNTRIES OUTSIDE OF THE U.S., PRECISE

INFORMATION REGARDING THE DATE OF RECEIPT BY THE CUSTOMER IS NOT

READILY AVAILABLE. IN THESE CASES, WE ESTIMATE THE DATE OF

RECEIPT BY THE CUSTOMER BASED UPON HISTORICAL DELIVERY TIMES BY

GEOGRAPHIC LOCATION. ON THE BASIS OF OUR TESTS OF ACTUAL

TRANSACTIONS, WE HAVE NO INDICATION THAT THESE ESTIMATES HAVE

BEEN MATERIALLY INACCURATE HISTORICALLY.

AS PART OF OUR REVENUE RECOGNITION POLICY, WE

RECORD ESTIMATED SALES RETURNS AND MISCELLANEOUS CLAIMS FROM

CUSTOMERS AS REDUCTIONS TO REVENUES AT THE TIME REVENUES ARE

RECORDED. WE BASE OUR ESTIMATES ON HISTORICAL RATES OF PRODUCT

RETURNS AND CLAIMS, AND SPECIFIC IDENTIFICATION OF OUTSTANDING

CLAIMS AND OUTSTANDING RETURNS NOT YET RECEIVED FROM CUSTOMERS.

IN THE PAST, ACTUAL RETURNS AND CLAIMS HAVE NOT EXCEEDED OUR

RESERVES. HOWEVER, ACTUAL RETURNS AND CLAIMS IN ANY FUTURE

PERIOD ARE INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN AND THUS MAY DIFFER FROM OUR

ESTIMATES. IF ACTUAL OR EXPECTED FUTURE RETURNS AND CLAIMS WERE

SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER OR LOWER THAN THE RESERVES WE HAD

ESTABLISHED, WE WOULD RECORD A REDUCTION OR INCREASE TO NET

REVENUES IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH WE MADE SUCH DETERMINATION.

RESERVE FOR UNCOLLECTIBLE ACCOUNTS

RECEIVABLE

WE MAKE ONGOING ESTIMATES RELATING TO THE

COLLECTIBILITY OF OUR ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND MAINTAIN A RESERVE

FOR ESTIMATED LOSSES RESULTING FROM THE INABILITY OF OUR

CUSTOMERS TO MAKE REQUIRED PAYMENTS. IN DETERMINING THE AMOUNT

OF THE RESERVE, WE CONSIDER OUR HISTORICAL LEVEL OF CREDIT

LOSSES AND MAKE JUDGMENTS ABOUT THE CREDITWORTHINESS OF

SIGNIFICANT CUSTOMERS BASED ON ONGOING CREDIT EVALUATIONS.

HISTORICALLY, LOSSES FROM UNCOLLECTIBLE ACCOUNTS HAVE NOT

EXCEEDED OUR RESERVES. SINCE WE CANNOT PREDICT FUTURE CHANGES IN

THE FINANCIAL STABILITY OF OUR CUSTOMERS, ACTUAL FUTURE LOSSES

FROM UNCOLLECTIBLE ACCOUNTS MAY DIFFER FROM OUR ESTIMATES. IF

THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF OUR CUSTOMERS WERE TO DETERIORATE,

RESULTING IN THEIR INABILITY TO MAKE PAYMENTS, A LARGER RESERVE

MIGHT BE REQUIRED. IN THE EVENT WE DETERMINED THAT A SMALLER OR

LARGER RESERVE WAS APPROPRIATE, WE WOULD RECORD A CREDIT OR A

CHARGE TO SELLING AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE IN THE PERIOD IN

WHICH WE MADE SUCH A DETERMINATION.

14

TABLE OF CONTENTS

INVENTORY RESERVES

WE ALSO MAKE ONGOING ESTIMATES RELATING TO THE

MARKET VALUE OF INVENTORIES, BASED UPON OUR ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT

FUTURE DEMAND AND MARKET CONDITIONS. IF WE ESTIMATE THAT THE NET

REALIZABLE VALUE OF OUR INVENTORY IS LESS THAN THE COST OF THE

INVENTORY RECORDED ON OUR BOOKS, WE RECORD A RESERVE EQUAL TO

THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE COST OF THE INVENTORY AND THE

ESTIMATED MARKET VALUE. THIS RESERVE IS RECORDED AS A CHARGE TO

COST OF SALES. IF CHANGES IN MARKET CONDITIONS RESULT IN

REDUCTIONS IN THE ESTIMATED MARKET VALUE OF OUR INVENTORY BELOW

OUR PREVIOUS ESTIMATE, WE WOULD INCREASE OUR RESERVE IN THE

PERIOD IN WHICH WE MADE SUCH A DETERMINATION AND RECORD A CHARGE

TO COST OF SALES.

CONTINGENT PAYMENTS UNDER ENDORSEMENT

CONTRACTS

A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR DEMAND CREATION

(ADVERTISING AND PROMOTION) EXPENSE RELATES TO PAYMENTS UNDER

ENDORSEMENT CONTRACTS. IN GENERAL, ENDORSEMENT PAYMENTS ARE

EXPENSED UNIFORMLY OVER THE TERM OF THE CONTRACT. HOWEVER,

CERTAIN CONTRACT ELEMENTS MAY BE ACCOUNTED FOR DIFFERENTLY,

BASED UPON THE FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES OF EACH INDIVIDUAL

CONTRACT.

CERTAIN CONTRACTS PROVIDE FOR CONTINGENT PAYMENTS

TO ENDORSERS BASED UPON SPECIFIC ACHIEVEMENTS IN THEIR SPORTS

(E.G. WINNING A CHAMPIONSHIP). WE RECORD SELLING AND

ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE FOR THESE AMOUNTS WHEN THE ENDORSER

ACHIEVES THE SPECIFIC GOAL.

CERTAIN CONTRACTS PROVIDE FOR PAYMENTS BASED UPON

ENDORSERS MAINTAINING A LEVEL OF PERFORMANCE IN THEIR SPORT OVER

AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF TIME (E.G. MAINTAINING A TOP RANKING IN A

SPORT FOR A YEAR). THESE AMOUNTS ARE REPORTED IN SELLING AND

ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE WHEN WE DETERMINE THAT IT IS PROBABLE

THAT THE SPECIFIED LEVEL OF PERFORMANCE WILL BE MAINTAINED

THROUGHOUT THE PERIOD. IN THESE INSTANCES, TO THE EXTENT THAT

ACTUAL PAYMENTS TO THE ENDORSER DIFFER FROM OUR ESTIMATE DUE TO

CHANGES IN THE ENDORSERS ATHLETIC PERFORMANCE, INCREASED

OR DECREASED SELLING AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE MAY BE REPORTED

IN A FUTURE PERIOD.

CERTAIN CONTRACTS PROVIDE FOR ROYALTY PAYMENTS TO

ENDORSERS BASED UPON A PREDETERMINED PERCENTAGE OF SALES OF

PARTICULAR PRODUCTS. WE EXPENSE THESE PAYMENTS IN COST OF SALES

AS THE RELATED SALES ARE MADE. IN CERTAIN CONTRACTS, WE OFFER

MINIMUM GUARANTEED ROYALTY PAYMENTS. FOR CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS

FOR WHICH WE ESTIMATE THAT WE WILL NOT MEET THE MINIMUM

GUARANTEED AMOUNT OF ROYALTY FEES THROUGH SALES OF PRODUCT, WE

RECORD IN SELLING AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE THE MINIMUM

GUARANTEED PAYMENT AMOUNT UNIFORMLY OVER THE REMAINING ROYALTY

TERM.

PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT AND OTHER

LONG-LIVED ASSETS

PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT, INCLUDING

BUILDINGS, EQUIPMENT, AND COMPUTER HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE IS

RECORDED AT COST (INCLUDING, IN SOME CASES, THE COST OF INTERNAL

LABOR) AND IS DEPRECIATED OVER ITS ESTIMATED USEFUL LIFE.

CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES (SUCH AS TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES OR

CHANGES TO OUR BUSINESS OPERATIONS) CAN RESULT IN DIFFERENCES

BETWEEN THE ACTUAL AND ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES. IN THOSE CASES

WHERE WE DETERMINE THAT THE USEFUL LIFE OF A LONG-LIVED ASSET

SHOULD BE SHORTENED, WE INCREASE DEPRECIATION EXPENSE OVER THE

REMAINING USEFUL LIFE TO DEPRECIATE THE ASSETS NET BOOK

VALUE TO ITS SALVAGE VALUE.

UNDER CURRENT ACCOUNTING STANDARDS, WHEN EVENTS

OR CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THAT THE CARRYING VALUE OF A

LONG-LIVED ASSET MAY BE IMPAIRED, WE ESTIMATE THE FUTURE

UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS TO BE DERIVED FROM THE ASSET TO

DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT A POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT EXISTS. IF THE

CARRYING VALUE EXCEEDS OUR ESTIMATE OF FUTURE UNDISCOUNTED CASH

FLOWS, WE THEN CALCULATE THE IMPAIRMENT AS THE EXCESS OF THE

CARRYING VALUE OF THE ASSET OVER OUR ESTIMATE OF ITS FAIR MARKET

VALUE. ANY IMPAIRMENT CHARGES ARE RECORDED AS OTHER EXPENSE. WE

ESTIMATE FUTURE UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS USING ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT

OUR EXPECTED FUTURE OPERATING PERFORMANCE. OUR ESTIMATES OF

UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS MAY DIFFER FROM ACTUAL CASH FLOWS DUE

TO, AMONG OTHER THINGS, TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGES, ECONOMIC

CONDITIONS, OR CHANGES TO OUR BUSINESS OPERATIONS. FOR FISCAL

2002, NO SIGNIFICANT IMPAIRMENT RELATED TO THE CARRYING VALUE OF

OUR LONG-LIVED ASSETS (INCLUDING PROPERTY, PLANT, AND EQUIPMENT,

GOODWILL, AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS) HAS BEEN RECORDED UNDER

CURRENT ACCOUNTING STANDARDS. HOWEVER, AS OF JUNE 1, 2002,

WE WILL ADOPT STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS (SFAS)

NO. 142, GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS.

WE EXPECT TO RECORD AN IMPAIRMENT CHARGE RELATED TO THE GOODWILL

15

TABLE OF CONTENTS

AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS OF OUR SUBSIDIARIES

BAUER NIKE HOCKEY, INC. AND COLE-HAAN HOLDINGS, INC. IN THE

FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2003. SEE RECENTLY ISSUED

ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BELOW.

HEDGE ACCOUNTING FOR DERIVATIVES

WE USE FORWARD EXCHANGE CONTRACTS AND OPTION

CONTRACTS TO HEDGE CERTAIN ANTICIPATED FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE

TRANSACTIONS, AS WELL AS ANY RESULTING RECEIVABLE OR PAYABLE

BALANCE. WHEN SPECIFIC CRITERIA REQUIRED BY SFAS NO. 133,

ACCOUNTING FOR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING

ACTIVITIES, HAVE BEEN MET, CHANGES IN FAIR VALUES OF HEDGE

CONTRACTS RELATING TO ANTICIPATED TRANSACTIONS ARE RECORDED IN

OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME RATHER THAN CURRENT EARNINGS UNTIL

THE UNDERLYING HEDGED TRANSACTION AFFECTS CURRENT EARNINGS. IN

MOST CASES, THIS RESULTS IN GAINS AND LOSSES ON HEDGE

DERIVATIVES BEING RELEASED FROM OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME INTO

CURRENT EARNINGS SOME TIME AFTER THE MATURITY OF THE DERIVATIVE.

ONE OF THE CRITERIA FOR THIS ACCOUNTING TREATMENT IS THAT THE

FORWARD EXCHANGE CONTRACT AMOUNT SHOULD NOT BE IN EXCESS OF

SPECIFICALLY IDENTIFIED ANTICIPATED TRANSACTIONS. BY THEIR VERY

NATURE, OUR ESTIMATES OF ANTICIPATED TRANSACTIONS MAY FLUCTUATE

OVER TIME AND MAY ULTIMATELY VARY FROM ACTUAL TRANSACTIONS. WHEN

ANTICIPATED TRANSACTION ESTIMATES OR ACTUAL TRANSACTION AMOUNTS

DECREASE BELOW HEDGED LEVELS, OR WHEN THE TIMING OF TRANSACTIONS

CHANGES SIGNIFICANTLY, WE ARE REQUIRED TO RECLASSIFY AT LEAST A

PORTION OF THE CUMULATIVE CHANGES IN FAIR VALUES OF THE RELATED

HEDGE CONTRACTS FROM OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME TO OTHER INCOME/

EXPENSE DURING THE QUARTER IN WHICH SUCH CHANGES OCCUR. ONCE AN

ANTICIPATED TRANSACTION ESTIMATE OR ACTUAL TRANSACTION AMOUNT

DECREASES BELOW HEDGED LEVELS, WE MAKE ADJUSTMENTS TO THE

RELATED HEDGE CONTRACT IN ORDER TO REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF THE

HEDGE CONTRACT TO THAT OF THE REVISED ANTICIPATED TRANSACTION.

TAXES

WE RECORD VALUATION ALLOWANCES AGAINST OUR

DEFERRED TAX ASSETS, WHEN NECESSARY, IN ACCORDANCE WITH SFAS

NO. 109, ACCOUNTING FOR INCOME TAXES.

REALIZATION OF DEFERRED TAX ASSETS (SUCH AS NET OPERATING LOSS

CARRYFORWARDS) IS DEPENDENT ON FUTURE TAXABLE EARNINGS AND IS

THEREFORE UNCERTAIN. AT LEAST QUARTERLY, WE ASSESS THE

LIKELIHOOD THAT OUR DEFERRED TAX ASSET BALANCE WILL BE RECOVERED

FROM FUTURE TAXABLE INCOME. TO THE EXTENT WE BELIEVE THAT

RECOVERY IS NOT LIKELY, WE ESTABLISH A VALUATION ALLOWANCE

AGAINST OUR DEFERRED TAX ASSET, INCREASING OUR INCOME TAX

EXPENSE IN THE PERIOD SUCH DETERMINATION IS MADE.

IN ADDITION, WE HAVE NOT RECORDED U.S. INCOME TAX

EXPENSE FOR FOREIGN EARNINGS THAT WE HAVE DECLARED AS

INDEFINITELY REINVESTED OFFSHORE, THUS REDUCING OUR OVERALL

INCOME TAX EXPENSE. THE AMOUNT OF EARNINGS DESIGNATED AS

INDEFINITELY REINVESTED OFFSHORE IS BASED UPON THE ACTUAL

DEPLOYMENT OF SUCH EARNINGS IN OUR OFFSHORE ASSETS AND OUR

EXPECTATIONS OF THE FUTURE CASH NEEDS OF OUR U.S. AND FOREIGN

ENTITIES. INCOME TAX CONSIDERATIONS ARE ALSO A FACTOR IN

DETERMINING THE AMOUNT OF FOREIGN EARNINGS TO BE REPATRIATED.

IN THE EVENT ACTUAL CASH NEEDS OF OUR U.S.

ENTITIES EXCEED OUR CURRENT EXPECTATIONS OR THE ACTUAL CASH

NEEDS OF OUR FOREIGN ENTITIES ARE LESS THAN EXPECTED, WE MAY

NEED TO REPATRIATE FOREIGN EARNINGS WHICH HAVE BEEN DESIGNATED

AS INDEFINITELY REINVESTED OFFSHORE. THIS WOULD RESULT IN

ADDITIONAL INCOME TAX EXPENSE BEING RECORDED.

WE TAKE A CONSERVATIVE APPROACH IN DETERMINING

THE AMOUNT OF FOREIGN EARNINGS TO DECLARE AS REINVESTED

OFFSHORE. AS REQUIRED BY U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING

PRINCIPLES, THE PRESUMPTION IS THAT SUCH EARNINGS WILL BE

REPATRIATED IN THE FUTURE. IN ORDER TO OVERCOME THIS

PRESUMPTION, WE CAREFULLY REVIEW ALL FACTORS WHICH DRIVE THE

ULTIMATE DISPOSITION OF SUCH FOREIGN EARNINGS, AND APPLY

STRINGENT STANDARDS TO OVERCOMING THE PRESUMPTION OF

REPATRIATION. DESPITE THIS CONSERVATIVE APPROACH, BECAUSE THE

DETERMINATION INVOLVES OUR FUTURE PLANS AND EXPECTATIONS OF

FUTURE EVENTS, THERE IS A POSSIBILITY THAT AMOUNTS DECLARED AS

INDEFINITELY REINVESTED OFFSHORE MAY ULTIMATELY BE REPATRIATED.

CONVERSELY, THIS CONSERVATIVE APPROACH MAY RESULT IN ACCUMULATED

FOREIGN EARNINGS (FOR WHICH U.S. INCOME TAXES HAVE BEEN

PROVIDED) BEING DETERMINED IN THE FUTURE TO BE INDEFINITELY

REINVESTED OFFSHORE. IN THIS LATTER CASE, OUR INCOME TAX EXPENSE

WOULD BE REDUCED IN THE YEAR OF SUCH DETERMINATION.

ON AN INTERIM BASIS, WE ESTIMATE WHAT OUR

EFFECTIVE TAX RATE WILL BE FOR THE FULL FISCAL YEAR AND RECORD A

QUARTERLY INCOME TAX PROVISION IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE

ANTICIPATED ANNUAL RATE. AS THE FISCAL YEAR PROGRESSES, WE

CONTINUALLY REFINE OUR ESTIMATE BASED UPON ACTUAL EVENTS AND

EARNINGS BY JURISDICTION DURING THE YEAR. THIS

16

TABLE OF CONTENTS

CONTINUAL ESTIMATION PROCESS PERIODICALLY RESULTS

IN A CHANGE TO OUR EXPECTED EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR THE FISCAL

YEAR. WHEN THIS OCCURS, WE ADJUST THE INCOME TAX PROVISION

DURING THE QUARTER IN WHICH THE CHANGE IN ESTIMATE OCCURS SO

THAT THE YEAR-TO-DATE PROVISION EQUALS THE EXPECTED ANNUAL RATE.

OTHER CONTINGENCIES

IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS, WE ARE

INVOLVED IN LEGAL PROCEEDINGS INVOLVING CONTRACTUAL AND

EMPLOYMENT RELATIONSHIPS, PRODUCT LIABILITY CLAIMS, TRADEMARK

RIGHTS, AND A VARIETY OF OTHER MATTERS. WE RECORD CONTINGENT

LIABILITIES RESULTING FROM CLAIMS AGAINST US WHEN IT IS PROBABLE

THAT A LIABILITY HAS BEEN INCURRED AND THE AMOUNT OF THE LOSS IS

REASONABLY ESTIMABLE. WE DISCLOSE CONTINGENT LIABILITIES WHEN

THERE IS A REASONABLE POSSIBILITY THAT THE ULTIMATE LOSS WILL

EXCEED THE RECORDED LIABILITY. ESTIMATING PROBABLE LOSSES

REQUIRES ANALYSIS OF MULTIPLE FACTORS, IN SOME CASES INCLUDING

JUDGMENTS ABOUT THE POTENTIAL ACTIONS OF THIRD PARTY CLAIMANTS

AND COURTS. THEREFORE, ACTUAL LOSSES IN ANY FUTURE PERIOD ARE

INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN. CURRENTLY, WE DO NOT BELIEVE THAT ANY OF

OUR PENDING LEGAL PROCEEDINGS OR CLAIMS WILL HAVE A MATERIAL

IMPACT ON OUR FINANCIAL POSITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

HOWEVER, IF ACTUAL OR ESTIMATED PROBABLE FUTURE LOSSES EXCEED

OUR RECORDED LIABILITY FOR SUCH CLAIMS, WE WOULD RECORD

ADDITIONAL CHARGES AS OTHER EXPENSE DURING THE PERIOD IN WHICH

THE ACTUAL LOSS OR CHANGE IN ESTIMATE OCCURRED.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

FISCAL 2002 HIGHLIGHTS



REVENUES INCREASED 4.3% TO $9.9 BILLION,

COMPARED TO $9.5 BILLION IN FISCAL 2001.



INCOME BEFORE THE CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF AN

ACCOUNTING CHANGE INCREASED TO $668.3 MILLION FROM

$589.7 MILLION IN THE PRIOR YEAR, AN INCREASE OF 13.3%.

AFTER THE EFFECT OF THE ACCOUNTING CHANGE, NET INCOME ROSE 12.5%.



DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE BEFORE THE EFFECT OF

THE ACCOUNTING CHANGE INCREASED BY 13.9%, FROM $2.16 TO $2.46.

AFTER THE EFFECT OF THE ACCOUNTING CHANGE, DILUTED EARNINGS PER

SHARE ROSE 13.0%.



GROSS MARGINS INCREASED AS A PERCENTAGE OF

REVENUES TO 39.3% FROM 39.0% IN FISCAL 2001.



SELLING AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES INCREASED AS

A PERCENTAGE OF REVENUES TO 28.5% FROM 28.3% IN FISCAL 2001.

FISCAL 2002 COMPARED TO FISCAL

2001

NET INCOME INCREASED 13.3% OVER FISCAL 2001, FROM

$589.7 MILLION TO $668.3 MILLION (EXCLUDING AN

AFTER-TAX LOSS OF $5.0 MILLION RELATED TO THE CUMULATIVE

EFFECT OF THE ADOPTION OF SFAS NO. 133, ACCOUNTING

FOR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES).

DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE BEFORE THE EFFECT OF THE ACCOUNTING

CHANGE IMPROVED 13.9%, FROM $2.16 TO $2.46. THESE INCREASES

REFLECTED A 10.4% INCREASE IN INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES AND A

1.7 POINT DECREASE IN OUR EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE. THE

INCREASE IN INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES WAS DUE TO INCREASED

REVENUES, IMPROVED GROSS MARGINS AND LOWER INTEREST AND OTHER

EXPENSES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A SLIGHT INCREASE IN SELLING AND

ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES AS A PERCENTAGE OF REVENUES.

FISCAL 2002 REVENUES WERE THE HIGHEST IN OUR

HISTORY, REFLECTING INCREASED NIKE BRAND SALES IN ALL OF OUR

GEOGRAPHIC REGIONS. IN THE U.S., NIKE BRAND REVENUES INCREASED

2.0% FOR THE FISCAL YEAR, DRIVEN BY INCREASED SALES OF APPAREL

AND EQUIPMENT. THE INCREASED SALES IN APPAREL REFLECTED HIGHER

DEMAND FOR IN-LINE PRODUCTS, PARTICULARLY FOR NIKE BRAND AND

BRAND JORDAN BASKETBALL APPAREL, MORE THAN OFFSETTING THE EFFECT

OF THE EXPIRATION OF OUR APPAREL LICENSE AGREEMENT WITH THE

NATIONAL FOOTBALL LEAGUE LAST YEAR. IN EQUIPMENT, OUR RAPIDLY

GROWING GOLF BUSINESS DROVE A 21.7% INCREASE FOR THE YEAR.

U.S. FOOTWEAR REVENUES DECLINED 0.7% VERSUS

FISCAL 2001. WHILE IN-LINE SALES OF FOOTWEAR INCREASED COMPARED

TO LAST YEAR, PARTICULARLY IN THE MID-RANGE PRICE SEGMENT,

CLOSE-OUT SALES DECREASED SIGNIFICANTLY. THE REDUCTION IN

CLOSE-OUT SALES REFLECTED BOTH OUR EFFORTS TO LIMIT THE

AVAILABILITY OF CLOSE-OUT PRODUCTS IN THE MARKETPLACE (IN ORDER

TO BUILD OVERALL PROFITABILITY) AND RELATIVELY HIGH LEVELS OF

CLOSE-OUT SALES IN THE LAST HALF OF FISCAL 2001 DUE TO SUPPLY

CHAIN SYSTEM DISRUPTIONS DISCUSSED FURTHER BELOW IN THE

FISCAL 2001 COMPARED TO

17

TABLE OF CONTENTS

FISCAL 2000

SECTION.

AS IN THE APPAREL BUSINESS, SALES OF NIKE BRAND AND BRAND JORDAN

BASKETBALL FOOTWEAR PRODUCTS WERE THE PRIMARY DRIVERS OF

INCREASED WHOLESALE SALES OF IN-LINE FOOTWEAR DURING THE YEAR.

IN FISCAL 2002, NIKE BRAND REVENUES FROM OUR

INTERNATIONAL REGIONS CONTINUED TO GROW VERSUS THE PRIOR YEAR,

BOTH AS A PERCENTAGE OF TOTAL COMPANY REVENUES AND IN TOTAL

DOLLARS. THESE REVENUES REPRESENTED 45.6% OF TOTAL COMPANY

REVENUES AS COMPARED TO 44.6% IN FISCAL 2001. REVENUES FROM OUR

INTERNATIONAL REGIONS WERE $4.5 BILLION AS COMPARED TO

$4.2 BILLION IN FISCAL 2001, A 6.6% INCREASE. HAD THE U.S.

DOLLAR REMAINED CONSTANT WITH THE PRIOR YEAR, THESE

INTERNATIONAL REVENUES WOULD HAVE INCREASED 12.4%, AND

CONSOLIDATED REVENUES WOULD HAVE INCREASED 6.9% (COMPARED TO

4.3% GROWTH AS REPORTED).

INCREASED REVENUES IN EACH OF OUR INTERNATIONAL

REGIONS RESULTED FROM HIGHER DEMAND FOR PRODUCTS IN ALL NIKE

BRAND BUSINESSES: FOOTWEAR, APPAREL, AND EQUIPMENT. REVENUES IN

OUR EUROPE, MIDDLE EAST, AND AFRICA (EMEA) REGION INCREASED FOR

THE EIGHTH CONSECUTIVE YEAR. FISCAL 2002 REPORTED REVENUES IN

EMEA INCREASED BY 5.7% OVER FISCAL 2001, A 9.6% INCREASE IN

CONSTANT DOLLARS. IN OUR ASIA PACIFIC REGION, REPORTED REVENUES

GREW 9.2%, A 19.3% INCREASE IN CONSTANT DOLLARS. THE AMERICAS

REGION GREW REPORTED REVENUES 5.4%, AN 11.9% INCREASE IN

CONSTANT DOLLARS, DESPITE A DROP-OFF IN SALES IN ARGENTINA

DURING THE SECOND HALF OF THE YEAR DUE TO THAT COUNTRYS

ECONOMIC CRISIS.

IN FISCAL 2002, OTHER REVENUE, WHICH PRIMARILY

INCLUDES REVENUES FROM BAUER NIKE HOCKEY, COLE HAAN, AND HURLEY,

INCREASED 6.8% TO $465.7 MILLION.

FOOT LOCKER, INC. IS OUR LARGEST SINGLE CUSTOMER

AND REPRESENTED 10.9% OF OUR WORLDWIDE REVENUES IN FISCAL 2002.

FOOT LOCKER HAS EXPRESSED ITS INTENTION TO REDUCE THE EMPHASIS

OF ITS U.S. BUSINESS ON HIGHER-PRICED, PREMIUM FOOTWEAR AND

PLACE MORE FOCUS ON MODERATELY-PRICED OFFERINGS. DUE TO THIS

CHANGE IN STRATEGY, FOOT LOCKERS FUTURES ORDERS IN THE

U.S. FOR THE HOLIDAY SEASON (SCHEDULED FOR DELIVERY FROM

SEPTEMBER THROUGH NOVEMBER 2002) DECREASED SIGNIFICANTLY VERSUS

THE SAME PERIOD IN THE PREVIOUS YEAR. IN SPITE OF THE REDUCTION

IN ORDERS FROM FOOT LOCKER, TOTAL U.S. FUTURES ORDERS FOR

THE SEPTEMBER TO NOVEMBER PERIOD ARE DOWN ONLY 2.3% VERSUS THE

PRIOR YEAR AND WORLDWIDE FUTURES ORDERS FOR THE SAME PERIOD

INCREASED 3.0% VERSUS FISCAL 2002.

THE IMPACT OF LOWER ORDERS FROM FOOT LOCKER FOR

THE SEPTEMBER TO NOVEMBER PERIOD WAS LARGELY INCLUDED IN THE

JUNE TO NOVEMBER FUTURES ORDERS REPORTED IN OUR JUNE 27,

2002 PRESS RELEASE. HOWEVER, ADDITIONAL CHANGES IN NOVEMBER

ORDERS FROM FOOT LOCKER REDUCED THE OVERALL GROWTH OF WORLDWIDE

FUTURES FOR THE SIX-MONTH PERIOD BY APPROXIMATELY 30 BASIS

POINTS TO 6.3%.

ALTHOUGH WE EXPECT FOOT LOCKER TO CONTINUE TO BE

AN IMPORTANT RETAIL PARTNER FOR NIKE, SECOND HALF U.S. FOOTWEAR

ORDERS FROM THIS CUSTOMER WILL LIKELY BE SIGNIFICANTLY BELOW THE

PRIOR YEAR. WE ARE AGGRESSIVELY PURSUING INCREMENTAL SALES

ACROSS OUR BUSINESS AS WE WORK TO OFFSET THESE DECLINES AND

ACHIEVE OUR WORLDWIDE REVENUE GROWTH GOALS FOR THE YEAR. WE

BELIEVE THERE CONTINUES TO BE STRONG CONSUMER DEMAND FOR

HIGH-END, PERFORMANCE FOOTWEAR; THIS SEGMENT HAS ALWAYS BEEN

CENTRAL TO THE SUCCESS OF THE NIKE BRAND. THEREFORE, WE WILL

CONTINUE TO WORK AGGRESSIVELY WITH THOSE RETAILERS WHO ARE

FOCUSED ON SERVING THIS MARKET. WHILE THE SUCCESS OF THESE

EFFORTS OVER THE NEXT FEW QUARTERS IS UNCERTAIN, WE REMAIN

CONFIDENT IN THE LONG-TERM STRENGTH OF OUR BRAND AND OUR

BUSINESS.

WORLDWIDE FUTURES (ADVANCE) ORDERS FOR NIKE BRAND

ATHLETIC FOOTWEAR AND APPAREL SCHEDULED FOR DELIVERY FROM JUNE

THROUGH NOVEMBER 2002 WERE 6.3% HIGHER THAN SUCH ORDERS BOOKED

IN THE COMPARABLE PERIOD OF FISCAL 2002. THE PERCENTAGE GROWTH

IN FUTURES ORDERS IS NOT NECESSARILY INDICATIVE OF OUR

EXPECTATION OF REVENUE GROWTH IN SUBSEQUENT PERIODS. THIS IS

BECAUSE THE MIX OF ORDERS CAN SHIFT BETWEEN ADVANCE/FUTURES AND

AT-ONCE ORDERS. IN ADDITION, EXCHANGE RATE FLUCTUATIONS AS WELL

AS DIFFERING LEVELS OF ORDER CANCELLATIONS CAN CAUSE DIFFERENCES

IN THE COMPARISONS BETWEEN FUTURE ORDERS AND ACTUAL REVENUES.

FINALLY, A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR REVENUES ARE NOT DERIVED

FROM FUTURES ORDERS, INCLUDING WHOLESALE SALES OF EQUIPMENT,

U.S. LICENSED TEAM APPAREL, BAUER NIKE HOCKEY, COLE HAAN,

HURLEY, AND RETAIL SALES ACROSS ALL BRANDS. IN THE FIRST QUARTER

OF FISCAL 2003, WE EXPECT THAT REVENUE GROWTH WILL LAG FUTURES

ORDER GROWTH, REFLECTING LOWER CLOSE-OUT SALES VERSUS THE FIRST

QUARTER OF FISCAL 2002 AND LOWER RETAIL SALES VERSUS THE SAME

PERIOD LAST YEAR AS U.S. RETAIL SALES HAVE REMAINED AT

RELATIVELY LOW LEVELS SINCE THE TERRORIST ATTACKS OF

SEPTEMBER 11, 2001.

OUR GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE IMPROVED 30 BASIS

POINTS, FROM 39.0% IN FISCAL 2001 TO 39.3% IN FISCAL 2002.

FACTORS CONTRIBUTING TO THE IMPROVED GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE

VERSUS THE PRIOR YEAR WERE AS FOLLOWS.

(1)

HIGHER IN-LINE PRICING MARGINS IN EMEA, DUE TO

THE EFFECT OF HIGHER PRICES EFFECTIVE AT THE BEGINNING OF THE

FISCAL YEAR AND SOURCING AND WAREHOUSING EFFICIENCIES, PARTIALLY

OFFSET BY THE EFFECT OF WEAKER EURO/U.S. DOLLAR CURRENCY

HEDGE RATES RELATIVE TO FISCAL 2001.

(2)

HIGHER FOOTWEAR MARGINS IN THE U.S. DUE IN PART

TO LOWER PRODUCT COSTS AND LOWER TRANSPORTATION COSTS, AS A

RESULT OF BOTH EFFECTIVE NEGOTIATIONS WITH SHIPPERS AND LOWER

AIR FREIGHT COSTS INCURRED. RELATIVELY HIGHER AIR FREIGHT COSTS

WERE INCURRED IN FISCAL 2001 DUE TO SUPPLY CHAIN PROBLEMS

DISCUSSED FOLLOWING.

(3)

A HIGHER MIX OF IN-LINE SALES VERSUS CLOSE-OUT

SALES OF U.S. FOOTWEAR, REFLECTING INCREASED DEMAND FOR

IN-LINE FOOTWEAR AND LOWER CLOSE-OUT SALES AS COMPARED TO FISCAL

2001 AS DISCUSSED ABOVE.

SELLING AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES INCREASED AS

A PERCENTAGE OF REVENUES FROM 28.3% IN FISCAL 2001 TO 28.5% IN

FISCAL 2002. OPERATING OVERHEAD INCREASED 6.0% DURING FISCAL

2002 LARGELY AS A RESULT OF OUR CONTINUED INVESTMENT IN

INITIATIVES INTENDED TO GENERATE FUTURE REVENUES AND PROFITS.

SIGNIFICANT DRIVERS OF THE INCREASED OPERATING OVERHEAD INCLUDED

INCREASED INVESTMENT IN OUR SUPPLY CHAIN INITIATIVE, ADDITIONAL

HEADCOUNT TO SUPPORT OUR GROWING GOLF AND EUROPEAN BUSINESSES,

ADDITIONAL EXPENSE FOR COMPENSATION PROGRAMS TIED TO OUR

19

TABLE OF CONTENTS

PROFITABILITY AND STOCK PERFORMANCE, AND COSTS

FOR ADDITIONAL RETAIL STORES PRIMARILY IN OUR EMEA AND ASIA

PACIFIC REGIONS.

THE SUPPLY CHAIN INITIATIVE REFERS TO OUR

ON-GOING DEVELOPMENT OF SYSTEMS AND PROCESSES SUPPORTING OUR

WORLDWIDE SUPPLY CHAIN. THIS INITIATIVE IS INTENDED TO IMPROVE

REVENUE (BY INCREASING OUR ABILITY TO RESPOND TO MARKET

CONDITIONS), MARGINS (BY LOWERING CLOSE-OUTS AND DISTRIBUTION

COSTS) AND CASH FLOW (BY REDUCING INVENTORIES). THE ULTIMATE

LEVEL OF BENEFIT TO REVENUES, MARGINS, AND CASH FLOWS, IF ANY,

WILL NOT BE KNOWN UNTIL THE NEW SYSTEMS AND PROCESSES HAVE BEEN

IMPLEMENTED WORLDWIDE OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS. DURING FISCAL

2002, WE IMPLEMENTED NEW SYSTEMS AND PROCESSES FOR CERTAIN

GLOBAL FUNCTIONS AND FOR OUR U.S. BUSINESS, AND WE PLAN ON

IMPLEMENTING NEW SYSTEMS AND PROCESSES IN EMEA DURING FISCAL

2003. IN FISCAL 2003, WE WILL CONTINUE TO INVEST IN THE

IMPLEMENTATION OF THE NEW SYSTEMS WORLDWIDE AND SUPPORT OUR

EXISTING SYSTEM INFRASTRUCTURE FOR THOSE BUSINESSES WHERE WE

HAVE NOT YET IMPLEMENTED THE NEW SYSTEMS.

DEMAND CREATION EXPENSE WAS $1,027.9 MILLION

IN FISCAL 2002 VERSUS $998.2 MILLION IN FISCAL 2001, WHICH

WAS CONSISTENT BETWEEN YEARS AS A PERCENTAGE OF REVENUES. OUR

FISCAL 2002 DEMAND CREATION EXPENSE REFLECTED INCREMENTAL

SPENDING FOR OUR WORLD CUP 2002 MARKETING CAMPAIGN, WHICH

OCCURRED PRIMARILY IN OUR INTERNATIONAL REGIONS. IN FISCAL 2003,

WE EXPECT DEMAND CREATION EXPENSE TO GROW SLIGHTLY FASTER THAN

REVENUES, REFLECTING THE CONTINUATION OF THE WORLD CUP 2002

CAMPAIGN INTO THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2003. IN ADDITION, WE

HAVE ENTERED INTO A LONG-TERM LICENSE AND ENDORSEMENT AGREEMENT

WITH MANCHESTER UNITED, ONE OF THE PREMIER SOCCER CLUBS IN THE

WORLD, WHICH BEGINS IN AUGUST 2002. PAYMENTS UNDER THIS CONTRACT

WILL RESULT IN ADDITIONAL DEMAND CREATION EXPENSE.

INTEREST EXPENSE DECREASED 18.9%, FROM

$58.7 MILLION TO $47.6 MILLION IN FISCAL 2002, DUE TO

LOWER INTEREST RATES IN THE CURRENT YEAR AND LOWER AVERAGE DEBT

LEVELS, AS WE USED OPERATING FREE CASH FLOW TO REDUCE DEBT.

OTHER INCOME/ EXPENSE WAS A NET EXPENSE OF

$3.0 MILLION VERSUS A NET EXPENSE OF $34.1 MILLION IN

FISCAL 2001. CONSISTENT WITH PREVIOUS YEARS, OTHER

INCOME/EXPENSE INCLUDED INTEREST INCOME, PROFIT SHARING EXPENSE,

GOODWILL AMORTIZATION, CERTAIN FOREIGN CURRENCY CONVERSION GAINS

AND LOSSES, AND ASSET DISPOSAL GAINS/ LOSSES. NET OTHER EXPENSE

DECREASED BETWEEN YEARS AS THE FISCAL 2001 AMOUNT INCLUDED

CHARGES FOR CONTRACTUAL SETTLEMENTS THAT DID NOT RECUR IN FISCAL

2002. IN ADDITION, FISCAL 2002 OTHER INCOME/ EXPENSE INCLUDED

CREDITS RELATED TO THE FAVORABLE RESOLUTION OF SOME OUTSTANDING

CLAIMS.

OUR FISCAL 2002 EFFECTIVE TAX RATE WAS 34.3% AS

COMPARED TO 36.0% IN FISCAL 2001. AS REQUIRED BY

U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES, WE DO NOT

ACCRUE FOR U.S. TAX LIABILITY ON FOREIGN EARNINGS

PERMANENTLY INVESTED OFFSHORE. THE LOWER EFFECTIVE TAX RATE IN

FISCAL 2002 IS PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF A LARGER AMOUNT OF

FOREIGN EARNINGS PERMANENTLY INVESTED OFFSHORE IN FISCAL 2002

THAN IN FISCAL 2001.

FISCAL 2001 COMPARED TO FISCAL

2000

NET INCOME INCREASED 1.8% OVER FISCAL 2000, FROM

$579.1 MILLION TO $589.7 MILLION. ALTHOUGH

CONSOLIDATED REVENUES INCREASED 5.5% OVER FISCAL 2000, INCOME

BEFORE INCOME TAXES WAS ESSENTIALLY FLAT AS PRETAX PROFIT

MARGINS DECREASED DUE TO A LOWER GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE, HIGHER

INTEREST EXPENSE, AND INCREASED OTHER EXPENSES, PARTIALLY OFFSET

BY LOWER SELLING AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES AS A PERCENTAGE OF

REVENUES. DESPITE FLAT INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES, NET INCOME

INCREASED DUE TO A LOWER EFFECTIVE TAX RATE. DILUTED EARNINGS

PER SHARE INCREASED 4.3%, FROM $2.07 TO $2.16. THE

PERCENTAGE INCREASE IN EARNINGS PER SHARE WAS HIGHER THAN THAT

OF NET INCOME PRIMARILY DUE TO SHARE REPURCHASES IN FISCAL YEARS

2000 AND 2001.

NIKE BRAND REVENUES IN THE U.S. REGION

INCREASED 1.8% AS COMPARED TO FISCAL 2000, WHILE NIKE BRAND

REVENUES IN OUR INTERNATIONAL REGIONS INCREASED 9.8%. HAD THE

U.S. DOLLAR REMAINED CONSTANT WITH THE PRIOR YEAR, THESE

INTERNATIONAL REVENUES WOULD HAVE INCREASED 18.6%, AND

CONSOLIDATED REVENUES WOULD HAVE ADVANCED 9.3%. IN THE U.S.

REGION, OUR LARGEST MARKET SEGMENT, THE 1.8% INCREASE IN

REVENUES REFLECTED A 9.2% INCREASE IN APPAREL SALES AND A 54.4%

INCREASE IN EQUIPMENT SALES, OFFSET BY A 4.2% DECREASE IN

FOOTWEAR SALES. THE INCREASES IN APPAREL AND EQUIPMENT REFLECTED

STRONGER DEMAND FOR IN-LINE PRODUCTS. THE INCREASE IN THE

EQUIPMENT PRODUCT LINE REFLECTED INCREASES IN A VARIETY OF

SPORTS EQUIPMENT CATEGORIES, INCLUDING GOLF, FOOTBALL, AND

BASEBALL PRODUCTS AS WELL AS SOCKS, BAGS AND EYEWEAR. THE

DECREASE IN FOOTWEAR REFLECTED LOWER DEMAND, PARTICULARLY IN THE

MID-RANGE PRICE SEGMENT, AND SUPPLY CHAIN DISRUPTIONS RESULTING

FROM THE IMPLEMENTATION OF

20

TABLE OF CONTENTS

A NEW GLOBAL DEMAND AND SUPPLY PLANNING SYSTEM.

THE SUPPLY CHAIN DISRUPTIONS RESULTED IN PRODUCT EXCESSES AS

WELL AS PRODUCT SHORTAGES AND LATE DELIVERIES IN THE SECOND HALF

OF THE FISCAL 2001.

REVENUES FROM OUR INTERNATIONAL REGIONS WERE

$4.2 BILLION AS COMPARED TO $3.9 BILLION IN FISCAL

2000. FISCAL 2001 REVENUES IN EMEA INCREASED OVER FISCAL 2000 BY

7.4% TO $2,584.8 MILLION, A 19.3% INCREASE IN CONSTANT

DOLLARS. IN OUR ASIA PACIFIC REGION, REVENUES GREW 16.2%, A

20.8% INCREASE IN CONSTANT DOLLARS. THE AMERICAS REGION GREW

REVENUES 9.1%, AN 11.4% INCREASE IN CONSTANT DOLLARS.

IN FISCAL 2001, OTHER REVENUE INCREASED 7.2% TO

$435.9 MILLION.

OUR GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE DECLINED

90 BASIS POINTS, FROM 39.9% IN FISCAL 2000 TO 39.0% IN

FISCAL 2001. FACTORS CONTRIBUTING TO THE LOWER GROSS MARGIN

PERCENTAGE WERE AS FOLLOWS.

(1)

THE EFFECT OF THE CHANGE IN FOREIGN EXCHANGE

RATES, MOST NOTABLY THE WEAKENING OF THE EURO AGAINST THE U.S.

DOLLAR RELATIVE TO FISCAL 2000.

(2)

A HIGHER MIX OF CLOSE-OUT SALES AS WELL AS LOWER

MARGINS ACHIEVED ON CLOSE-OUTS, PRIMARILY IN FOOTWEAR AND

LICENSED TEAM APPAREL IN THE U.S. IN FOOTWEAR, THE HIGHER MIX OF

CLOSE-OUTS AND LOWER CLOSE-OUT MARGINS WERE DUE IN PART TO THE

SUPPLY CHAIN DISRUPTIONS DISCUSSED ABOVE. HIGHER CLOSE-OUTS AND

LOWER MARGINS IN U.S. LICENSED TEAM APPAREL RESULTED

PRIMARILY FROM THE LIQUIDATION OF NATIONAL FOOTBALL LEAGUE

(NFL) TEAM APPAREL, DUE TO THE TERMINATION OF OUR

NFL LICENSE AGREEMENT.

(3)

PRODUCT RECALLS OF CERTAIN FOOTWEAR MODELS IN THE

UNITED STATES, WHICH RESULTED IN PRODUCT RETURNS AND WRITE-OFFS.

SELLING AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES DECREASED AS

A PERCENTAGE OF REVENUES FROM 29.0% TO 28.3%. DEMAND CREATION

EXPENSE DECREASED AS A PERCENTAGE OF REVENUES FROM 10.8% TO

10.5%. FISCAL 2001 DEMAND CREATION EXPENSE WAS

$998.2 MILLION VERSUS $974.1 MILLION IN FISCAL 2000.

THE OVERALL DECREASE IN SELLING AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES AS A

PERCENTAGE OF REVENUES REFLECTED COST CONTAINMENT MEASURES, BOTH

IN MARKETING AND OPERATIONAL AREAS. WHILE IMPLEMENTING THESE

MEASURES TO CONTROL SELLING AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE GROWTH,

WE ALSO CONTINUED TO INVEST IN OPERATIONAL INITIATIVES DESIGNED

TO CREATE FUTURE REVENUES AND PROFITS. THESE INITIATIVES

INCLUDED THE EXPANSION OF NIKE-OWNED RETAIL OUTLETS, THE

DEVELOPMENT OF E-COMMERCE APPLICATIONS, AND SYSTEMS AND

PROCESSES SUPPORTING OUR WORLDWIDE SUPPLY CHAIN. OUR LEVEL OF

INVESTMENT IN THESE AREAS IN FISCAL 2001 WAS COMPARABLE TO OUR

LEVEL OF INVESTMENT IN FISCAL 2000.

INTEREST EXPENSE INCREASED 30.4%, FROM

$45.0 MILLION TO $58.7 MILLION, DUE TO HIGHER AVERAGE

DEBT LEVELS IN FISCAL 2001 VERSUS FISCAL 2000. DURING FISCAL

2000, WE INCREASED DEBT TO FUND CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND HIGHER

WORKING CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS, AND TO REPURCHASE COMMON STOCK.

ALTHOUGH OUR DEBT BALANCE DECREASED DURING FISCAL 2001, THE

AVERAGE DEBT BALANCE FOR FISCAL 2001 REMAINED ABOVE THE PRIOR

YEAR.

OTHER INCOME/ EXPENSE WAS A NET EXPENSE OF

$34.1 MILLION VERSUS A NET EXPENSE OF $20.7 MILLION IN

FISCAL 2000. SIGNIFICANT AMOUNTS INCLUDED IN OTHER INCOME/

EXPENSE WERE INTEREST INCOME, PROFIT SHARING EXPENSE, GOODWILL

AMORTIZATION, CERTAIN FOREIGN CURRENCY CONVERSION GAINS AND

LOSSES, ASSET DISPOSAL GAINS AND LOSSES, AND CHARGES FOR

CONTRACTUAL SETTLEMENTS.

OUR FISCAL 2001 EFFECTIVE TAX RATE WAS 36.0% AS

COMPARED TO 37.0% IN FISCAL 2000. AS DISCUSSED ABOVE, WE DO NOT

ACCRUE FOR U.S. TAX LIABILITY ON FOREIGN EARNINGS

PERMANENTLY INVESTED OFFSHORE. THE LOWER EFFECTIVE TAX RATE IN

FISCAL 2001 WAS PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF LOWER TAXES ON A LARGER

AMOUNT OF FOREIGN EARNINGS THAT WERE PERMANENTLY INVESTED

OFFSHORE IN FISCAL 2001 THAN IN FISCAL 2000 AS WELL AS

ADDITIONAL RESEARCH TAX CREDITS.

RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

IN JULY 2001, THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

BOARD (FASB) ISSUED SFAS NO. 141, BUSINESS

COMBINATIONS (FAS 141) AND SFAS NO. 142,

GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS (FAS 142).

FAS 141 REQUIRES THE PURCHASE METHOD OF ACCOUNTING TO BE

USED FOR ALL BUSINESS COMBINATIONS INITIATED AFTER JUNE 30,

2001. FAS 141 ALSO REQUIRES A MORE RIGOROUS IDENTIFICATION

OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS WHICH MUST BE

21

TABLE OF CONTENTS

RECOGNIZED AND REPORTED SEPARATELY FROM GOODWILL.

THE ADOPTION OF FAS 141 WILL NOT HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON

OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR FINANCIAL POSITION.

FAS 142 REQUIRES THAT GOODWILL AND

INTANGIBLE ASSETS WITH INDEFINITE LIVES NO LONGER BE AMORTIZED

BUT INSTEAD BE MEASURED FOR IMPAIRMENT AT LEAST ANNUALLY, OR

WHEN EVENTS INDICATE THAT AN IMPAIRMENT EXISTS. OUR ADOPTION

DATE IS JUNE 1, 2002. AS OF THAT DATE, AMORTIZATION OF

OUTSTANDING GOODWILL AND OTHER INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE

ASSETS WILL CEASE. AS A RESULT OF THE ELIMINATION OF THIS

AMORTIZATION, OTHER EXPENSE WILL DECREASE BY APPROXIMATELY

$13 MILLION ANNUALLY BEGINNING IN FISCAL 2003.

AS REQUIRED BY FAS 142, WE WILL PERFORM

IMPAIRMENT TESTS ON GOODWILL AND OTHER INDEFINITE-LIVED

INTANGIBLE ASSETS AS OF THE ADOPTION DATE. THEREAFTER, WE WILL

PERFORM IMPAIRMENT TESTS ANNUALLY AND WHENEVER EVENTS OR

CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THAT THE VALUE OF GOODWILL OR OTHER

INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS MIGHT BE IMPAIRED. IN

CONNECTION WITH THE FAS 142 INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE

ASSET IMPAIRMENT TEST, WE WILL UTILIZE THE REQUIRED ONE-STEP

METHOD TO DETERMINE WHETHER AN IMPAIRMENT EXISTS AS OF THE

ADOPTION DATE. THE TEST WILL CONSIST OF A COMPARISON OF THE

ESTIMATED FAIR VALUES OF INDEFINITE-LIVED ASSETS WITH THE

CARRYING AMOUNTS. IF THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF AN INTANGIBLE ASSET

EXCEEDS OUR ESTIMATE OF ITS FAIR VALUE, WE WILL RECOGNIZE AN

IMPAIRMENT LOSS IN AN AMOUNT EQUAL TO THAT EXCESS.

IN CONNECTION WITH THE FAS 142 TRANSITIONAL

GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT TEST, WE WILL UTILIZE THE REQUIRED TWO-STEP

METHOD FOR DETERMINING GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT AS OF THE ADOPTION

DATE. TO ACCOMPLISH THIS, WE WILL IDENTIFY OUR REPORTING UNITS

AND DETERMINE THE CARRYING VALUE OF EACH REPORTING UNIT BY

ASSIGNING OUR ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, INCLUDING THE EXISTING

GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS, TO THOSE REPORTING UNITS AS OF

THE ADOPTION DATE. WE WILL THEN ESTIMATE THE FAIR VALUE OF EACH

REPORTING UNIT AND COMPARE IT TO THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF THE

REPORTING UNIT. TO THE EXTENT THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF A REPORTING

UNIT EXCEEDS OUR ESTIMATE OF THE FAIR VALUE OF THE REPORTING

UNIT, WE THEN WILL PERFORM THE SECOND STEP OF THE TRANSITIONAL

IMPAIRMENT TEST.

WHERE NECESSARY, IN THE SECOND STEP, WE WILL

COMPARE THE IMPLIED FAIR VALUE OF THE REPORTING UNIT GOODWILL

WITH THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF THE REPORTING UNIT GOODWILL, BOTH OF

WHICH WILL BE MEASURED AS OF THE ADOPTION DATE. THE IMPLIED FAIR

VALUE OF GOODWILL WILL BE DETERMINED BY ALLOCATING THE ESTIMATED

FAIR VALUE OF THE REPORTING UNIT TO ALL OF THE ASSETS

(RECOGNIZED AND UNRECOGNIZED) AND LIABILITIES OF THE REPORTING

UNIT IN A MANNER SIMILAR TO A PURCHASE PRICE ALLOCATION, IN

ACCORDANCE WITH FAS 141. THE RESIDUAL FAIR VALUE AFTER THIS

ALLOCATION WILL BE THE IMPLIED FAIR VALUE OF THE REPORTING UNIT

GOODWILL. WE WILL RECORD A TRANSITIONAL IMPAIRMENT LOSS FOR ANY

EXCESS OF THE CARRYING VALUE OF GOODWILL ALLOCATED TO THE

REPORTING UNIT OVER THE IMPLIED FAIR VALUE.

WE HAVE ESTIMATED THAT WE WILL LIKELY INCUR A

TRANSITIONAL IMPAIRMENT LOSS OF APPROXIMATELY $270 MILLION

RELATED TO OUR BAUER NIKE HOCKEY AND COLE HAAN SUBSIDIARIES,

REFLECTING THAT THE FAIR VALUES WE HAVE ESTIMATED FOR THESE

SUBSIDIARIES ARE LESS THAN THE CARRYING VALUES INCLUDING

GOODWILL. THIS EXPECTED TRANSITIONAL IMPAIRMENT LOSS WILL BE

RECOGNIZED AS THE CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF A CHANGE IN ACCOUNTING

PRINCIPLE IN OUR CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF INCOME DURING THE

FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2003.

IN OCTOBER 2001, THE FASB ISSUED

SFAS NO. 144, ACCOUNTING FOR THE IMPAIRMENT OR

DISPOSAL OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS (FAS 144). THIS

STATEMENT SUPERSEDES SFAS NO. 121, ACCOUNTING

FOR THE IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS AND FOR LONG-LIVED

ASSETS TO BE DISPOSED OF (FAS 121), AND AMENDS

ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES BOARD STATEMENT NO. 30,

REPORTING THE EFFECTS OF DISPOSAL OF A SEGMENT OF A

BUSINESS, AND EXTRAORDINARY, UNUSUAL AND INFREQUENTLY OCCURRING

EVENTS AND TRANSACTIONS (APB 30). FAS 144

REQUIRES THAT LONG-LIVED ASSETS THAT ARE TO BE DISPOSED OF BY

SALE BE MEASURED AT THE LOWER OF BOOK VALUE OR FAIR VALUE LESS

COSTS TO SELL. FAS 144 RETAINS THE FUNDAMENTAL PROVISIONS

OF FAS 121 FOR (A) RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT OF THE

IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS TO BE HELD AND USED AND

(B) MEASUREMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS TO BE DISPOSED OF BY

SALE. THIS STATEMENT ALSO RETAINS APB 30S REQUIREMENT

THAT COMPANIES REPORT DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS SEPARATELY FROM

CONTINUING OPERATIONS. ALL PROVISIONS OF THIS STATEMENT WILL BE

EFFECTIVE FOR US ON JUNE 1, 2003. WE DO NOT EXPECT THAT THE

ADOPTION OF FAS 144 WILL HAVE ANY IMPACT ON OUR

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL POSITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

FISCAL 2002 CASH FLOW

ACTIVITY

CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATIONS WAS

$1,081.5 MILLION IN FISCAL 2002, COMPARED TO

$656.5 MILLION IN FISCAL 2001. OUR PRIMARY SOURCE OF

OPERATING CASH FLOW WAS NET INCOME EARNED DURING THE YEAR OF

$663.3 MILLION. OPERATING CASH FLOW INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY

OVER THE PRIOR YEAR DUE TO REDUCED INVESTMENT IN CERTAIN WORKING

CAPITAL COMPONENTS DURING FISCAL 2002, WHICH GENERATED POSITIVE

OPERATING CASH FLOW.

CASH USED BY INVESTING ACTIVITIES DURING FISCAL

2002 WAS $302.8 MILLION, COMPARED TO $342.3 MILLION

INVESTED DURING FISCAL 2001. THE TOTAL FOR FISCAL 2002 RELATED

PRIMARILY TO CAPITAL EXPENDITURES FOR COMPUTER EQUIPMENT AND

SOFTWARE, DRIVEN BY OUR SUPPLY CHAIN INITIATIVE, AND INVESTMENTS

IN NEW RETAIL OUTLETS. IN ADDITION, WE ACQUIRED ALL OF THE

ASSETS AND SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE LIABILITIES OF HURLEY

INTERNATIONAL LLC, A TEEN LIFESTYLE BRAND COMPANY. DURING FISCAL

2003, WE WILL CONTINUE TO INCUR EXPENDITURES RELATED TO SYSTEMS

IMPROVEMENTS (MOST NOTABLY THE SUPPLY CHAIN INITIATIVE), RETAIL

EXPANSION, AND INVESTMENTS IN OUR WORLDWIDE WAREHOUSE FACILITIES.

CASH USED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES IN FISCAL 2002

WAS $478.2 MILLION, UP FROM $349.9 MILLION IN THE

PRIOR YEAR. THIS AMOUNT INCLUDED USES OF CASH FOR DIVIDENDS TO

SHAREHOLDERS, A NET REDUCTION IN DEBT, AND SHARE REPURCHASES.

THESE USES OF CASH WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY PROCEEDS FROM THE

EXERCISE OF EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTIONS.

THE SHARE REPURCHASES WERE PART OF A

$1.0 BILLION SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM THAT BEGAN IN FISCAL

2001, AFTER COMPLETION OF A FOUR-YEAR, $1.0 BILLION PROGRAM

IN FISCAL 2000. IN FISCAL 2002, WE REPURCHASED 4.3 MILLION

SHARES OF NIKES CLASS B COMMON STOCK FOR

$237.7 MILLION. TO DATE, UNDER THE CURRENT PROGRAM, WE HAVE

PURCHASED A TOTAL OF 8.3 MILLION SHARES OF NIKES

CLASS B COMMON STOCK FOR $394.7 MILLION. WE EXPECT TO

FUND THE CURRENT PROGRAM FROM OPERATING CASH FLOW. THE TIMING

AND THE AMOUNT OF SHARES PURCHASED WILL BE DICTATED BY OUR

IN ADDITION TO THE CASH PAYMENTS DISCLOSED ABOVE,

WE ARE OBLIGATED TO FURNISH THE ENDORSERS WITH NIKE PRODUCTS FOR

THEIR USE. IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO DETERMINE HOW MUCH WE WILL

SPEND ON THIS PRODUCT ON AN ANNUAL BASIS AS THE CONTRACTS DO NOT

STIPULATE A SPECIFIC AMOUNT OF CASH TO BE SPENT ON THE PRODUCT.

THE AMOUNT OF PRODUCT PROVIDED TO THE ENDORSERS WILL DEPEND ON

AN OUTSOURCING CONTRACTOR PROVIDES US WITH

INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT SERVICES THROUGH

2006. THE AMOUNT OF THE PAYMENTS IN FUTURE YEARS DEPENDS ON OUR

LEVEL OF MONTHLY USE OF THE DIFFERENT ELEMENTS OF THE

CONTRACTORS SERVICES. IF WE WERE TO TERMINATE THE ENTIRE

CONTRACT AS OF MAY 31, 2002, WE WOULD

23

BE REQUIRED TO PROVIDE THE CONTRACTOR WITH FOUR

MONTHS NOTICE AND PAY A TERMINATION LIABILITY OF

$22.6 MILLION. OUR MONTHLY PAYMENTS TO THE CONTRACTOR

CURRENTLY ARE APPROXIMATELY $6 MILLION.

WE ALSO HAVE THE FOLLOWING OUTSTANDING SHORT-TERM

DEBT OBLIGATIONS AS OF MAY 31, 2002. PLEASE REFER TO THE

ACCOMPANYING

CAPITAL RESOURCES

WE HAVE AN EFFECTIVE SHELF REGISTRATION STATEMENT

ON FILE WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

(SEC) UNDER WHICH $1.0 BILLION IN DEBT SECURITIES ARE

AVAILABLE TO BE ISSUED. ON MAY 29, 2002, WE COMMENCED A

MEDIUM-TERM NOTE PROGRAM UNDER THE SHELF REGISTRATION THAT

ALLOWS US TO ISSUE UP TO $500.0 MILLION IN MEDIUM-TERM

NOTES, AS OUR CAPITAL NEEDS DICTATE. WE ENTERED INTO THIS

PROGRAM TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL LIQUIDITY TO MEET OUR WORKING

CAPITAL AND GENERAL CORPORATE CASH REQUIREMENTS. AS OF

MAY 31, 2002, WE HAD NOT ISSUED ANY DEBT SECURITIES UNDER

THE SHELF REGISTRATION.

SUBSEQUENT TO MAY 31, 2002, WE ISSUED A

TOTAL OF $90 MILLION IN NOTES UNDER THE MEDIUM-TERM NOTE

PROGRAM. THE NOTES HAVE COUPON RATES THAT RANGE FROM 4.80% TO

5.66%. THE MATURITIES RANGE FROM JULY 9, 2007 TO

AUGUST 7, 2012. FOR $75 MILLION OF THE NOTES, WE

SIMULTANEOUSLY ENTERED INTO INTEREST RATE SWAP AGREEMENTS

WHEREBY WE RECEIVE FIXED INTEREST PAYMENTS AT THE SAME RATE AS

THE NOTES AND PAY VARIABLE INTEREST PAYMENTS BASED ON THE

SIX-MONTH LONDON INTER BANK OFFERING RATE (LIBOR) PLUS A

SPREAD. EACH SWAP HAS THE SAME NOTIONAL AMOUNT AND MATURITY DATE

AS ITS RESPECTIVE NOTE. AFTER ISSUANCE OF THESE NOTES,

$910.0 MILLION REMAINS AVAILABLE TO BE ISSUED UNDER OUR

SHELF REGISTRATION. WE MAY ISSUE ADDITIONAL NOTES UNDER THE

SHELF REGISTRATION IN FISCAL 2003 DEPENDING ON WORKING CAPITAL

AND GENERAL CORPORATE NEEDS.

AS OF MAY 31, 2001, WE HAD A

$750.0 MILLION, 364-DAY COMMITTED CREDIT FACILITY AND A

$500.0 MILLION, MULTI-YEAR COMMITTED CREDIT FACILITY IN

PLACE WITH A GROUP OF BANKS. IN NOVEMBER 2001, WE RENEWED THE

364-DAY FACILITY IN THE AMOUNT OF $600.0 MILLION. THUS, OUR

CURRENT TOTAL AVAILABILITY UNDER THESE TWO BANK FACILITIES IS

$1.1 BILLION. WE CURRENTLY HAVE NO AMOUNTS OUTSTANDING

UNDER THESE FACILITIES. THE $600.0 MILLION FACILITY MATURES

ON NOVEMBER 15, 2002 AND CAN BE EXTENDED 364 DAYS ON

EACH MATURITY DATE. THE $500.0 MILLION FACILITY MATURES ON

NOVEMBER 17, 2005, AND ONCE A YEAR, IT CAN BE EXTENDED FOR

ONE ADDITIONAL YEAR. BASED ON OUR CURRENT LONG-TERM SENIOR

UNSECURED DEBT RATINGS OF A AND A2 FROM STANDARD AND POORS

CORPORATION AND MOODYS INVESTOR SERVICES, RESPECTIVELY,

THE INTEREST RATE CHARGED ON ANY OUTSTANDING BORROWINGS ON THE

$600.0 MILLION FACILITY WOULD BE THE PREVAILING LIBOR PLUS

0.24%, AND THE INTEREST RATE CHARGED ON ANY OUTSTANDING

BORROWINGS ON THE $500.0 MILLION FACILITY WOULD BE THE

PREVAILING LIBOR PLUS 0.22%. THE FACILITY FEES FOR THE

$600.0 MILLION AND THE $500.0 MILLION FACILITIES ARE

0.06% AND 0.08%, RESPECTIVELY, OF THE TOTAL COMMITMENT.

IF OUR LONG-TERM DEBT RATING WERE TO DECLINE, THE

FACILITY FEES AND INTEREST RATES UNDER OUR COMMITTED CREDIT

FACILITIES WOULD INCREASE. CONVERSELY, IF OUR LONG-TERM DEBT

RATING IMPROVES, THE FACILITY FEES AND INTEREST RATES WOULD

DECREASE. CHANGES IN OUR LONG-TERM DEBT RATING WOULD NOT TRIGGER

ACCELERATION OF MATURITY OF ANY THEN OUTSTANDING BORROWINGS OR

ANY FUTURE BORROWINGS UNDER THE COMMITTED CREDIT FACILITIES.

HOWEVER, UNDER

24

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THESE COMMITTED CREDIT FACILITIES, WE HAVE AGREED

TO VARIOUS COVENANTS. THESE COVENANTS INCLUDE LIMITS ON OUR

DISPOSAL OF FIXED ASSETS AND THE AMOUNT OF DEBT SECURED BY LIENS

WE MAY INCUR, AND SET A MINIMUM RATIO OF NET WORTH TO

INDEBTEDNESS. IN THE EVENT WE WERE TO HAVE ANY BORROWINGS

OUTSTANDING UNDER THESE FACILITIES, FAILED TO MEET ANY COVENANT,

AND WERE UNABLE TO OBTAIN A WAIVER FROM A MAJORITY OF THE BANKS,

ANY BORROWINGS WOULD BECOME IMMEDIATELY DUE AND PAYABLE. AS OF

MAY 31, 2002, WE WERE IN FULL COMPLIANCE WITH EACH OF THESE

COVENANTS AND BELIEVE IT IS UNLIKELY WE WILL FAIL TO MEET ANY OF

THESE COVENANTS IN THE FUTURE.

LIQUIDITY IS ALSO PROVIDED BY OUR COMMERCIAL

PAPER PROGRAM, UNDER WHICH THERE WAS $338.3 MILLION AND

$710.0 MILLION OUTSTANDING AT MAY 31, 2002 AND MAY 31,

2001, RESPECTIVELY. WE CURRENTLY HAVE SHORT-TERM DEBT RATINGS OF

A1 AND P1 FROM STANDARD AND POORS CORPORATION AND

MOODYS INVESTOR SERVICES, RESPECTIVELY.

WE CURRENTLY BELIEVE THAT CASH GENERATED BY

OPERATIONS, TOGETHER WITH ACCESS TO EXTERNAL SOURCES OF FUNDS AS

DESCRIBED ABOVE, WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO MEET OUR OPERATING AND

CAPITAL NEEDS.

DIVIDENDS PER SHARE OF COMMON STOCK FOR FISCAL

2002 WERE $0.48, THE SAME AS IN FISCAL 2001. WE HAVE PAID A

DIVIDEND EVERY QUARTER SINCE FEBRUARY 1984. WE REVIEW OUR

DIVIDEND POLICY FROM TIME TO TIME; HOWEVER, BASED UPON CURRENT

PROJECTED EARNINGS AND CASH FLOW REQUIREMENTS, WE ANTICIPATE

CONTINUING TO PAY A QUARTERLY DIVIDEND.

ITEM 7A.

QUANTITATIVE

AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS AND CONSISTENT

WITH ESTABLISHED POLICIES AND PROCEDURES, WE EMPLOY A VARIETY OF

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS TO MANAGE EXPOSURE TO FLUCTUATIONS IN THE

VALUE OF FOREIGN CURRENCIES AND INTEREST RATES. IT IS OUR POLICY

TO UTILIZE THESE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS ONLY WHERE NECESSARY TO

FINANCE OUR BUSINESS AND MANAGE SUCH EXPOSURES; WE DO NOT ENTER

INTO THESE TRANSACTIONS FOR SPECULATIVE PURPOSES.

WE ARE EXPOSED TO FOREIGN CURRENCY FLUCTUATION AS

A RESULT OF OUR INTERNATIONAL SALES, PRODUCTION AND FUNDING

ACTIVITIES. OUR FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVE IS TO

REDUCE THE VARIABILITY OF LOCAL ENTITY CASH FLOWS AS A RESULT OF

EXCHANGE RATE MOVEMENTS. WE USE FORWARD EXCHANGE CONTRACTS AND

OPTIONS TO HEDGE CERTAIN ANTICIPATED BUT NOT YET FIRMLY

COMMITTED TRANSACTIONS AS WELL AS CERTAIN FIRM COMMITMENTS AND

THE RELATED RECEIVABLES AND PAYABLES, INCLUDING THIRD PARTY OR

INTERCOMPANY TRANSACTIONS.

WHEN WE BEGIN HEDGING EXPOSURES DEPENDS ON THE

NATURE OF THE EXPOSURE AND MARKET CONDITIONS. GENERALLY, ALL

ANTICIPATED AND FIRMLY COMMITTED TRANSACTIONS THAT ARE HEDGED

ARE TO BE RECOGNIZED WITHIN TWELVE MONTHS, ALTHOUGH AT

MAY 31, 2002 WE HAD FORWARD CONTRACTS HEDGING ANTICIPATED

TRANSACTIONS THAT WILL BE RECOGNIZED IN AS MANY AS

24 MONTHS. THE MAJORITY OF THE CONTRACTS EXPIRING IN MORE

THAN TWELVE MONTHS RELATE TO THE ANTICIPATED PURCHASE OF

INVENTORY BY OUR JAPANESE SUBSIDIARY. WE USE FORWARD CONTRACTS

AND CROSS-CURRENCY SWAPS TO HEDGE FOREIGN CURRENCY DENOMINATED

PAYMENTS UNDER INTERCOMPANY LOAN AGREEMENTS. WHEN INTERCOMPANY

LOANS ARE HEDGED, IT IS TYPICALLY FOR THEIR EXPECTED DURATION,

WHICH IN SOME CIRCUMSTANCES MAY BE IN EXCESS OF FIVE YEARS.

HEDGED TRANSACTIONS ARE PRINCIPALLY DENOMINATED IN EUROPEAN

CURRENCIES, JAPANESE YEN, CANADIAN DOLLARS, KOREAN WON, MEXICAN

PESOS, AUSTRALIAN DOLLARS AND NEW TAIWAN DOLLARS.

OUR EARNINGS ARE ALSO EXPOSED TO MOVEMENTS IN

SHORT AND LONG-TERM MARKET INTEREST RATES. OUR OBJECTIVE IN

MANAGING THIS INTEREST RATE EXPOSURE IS TO LIMIT THE IMPACT OF

INTEREST RATE CHANGES ON EARNINGS AND CASH FLOWS, AND TO REDUCE

OVERALL BORROWING COSTS. TO ACHIEVE THESE OBJECTIVES, WE

MAINTAIN A MIX OF MEDIUM AND LONG-TERM FIXED RATE DEBT,

COMMERCIAL PAPER, AND BANK LOANS AND HAVE ENTERED INTO INTEREST

RATE SWAPS UNDER WHICH WE RECEIVE FIXED INTEREST AND PAY

VARIABLE INTEREST.

MARKET RISK MEASUREMENT

WE MONITOR FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK, INTEREST RATE

RISK AND RELATED DERIVATIVES USING A VARIETY OF TECHNIQUES

INCLUDING A REVIEW OF MARKET VALUE, SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS, AND

VALUE-AT-RISK (VAR). OUR MARKET-SENSITIVE DERIVATIVE AND OTHER

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, AS DEFINED BY THE SEC, ARE FOREIGN

CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS, FOREIGN CURRENCY OPTION CONTRACTS,

CROSS-CURRENCY SWAPS, INTEREST RATE SWAPS, INTERCOMPANY LOANS

DENOMINATED IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES, FIXED INTEREST RATE

U.S. DOLLAR DENOMINATED DEBT, AND FIXED INTEREST RATE

JAPANESE YEN DENOMINATED DEBT.

25

TABLE OF CONTENTS

WE USE VAR TO MONITOR THE FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK

OF OUR FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD AND FOREIGN CURRENCY OPTION

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS ONLY. THE VAR DETERMINES THE MAXIMUM

POTENTIAL ONE-DAY LOSS IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THESE FOREIGN

EXCHANGE RATE-SENSITIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS. THE VAR MODEL

ESTIMATES ASSUME NORMAL MARKET CONDITIONS AND A 95% CONFIDENCE

LEVEL. THERE ARE VARIOUS MODELING TECHNIQUES THAT CAN BE USED IN

THE VAR COMPUTATION. OUR COMPUTATIONS ARE BASED ON

INTERRELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN CURRENCIES AND INTEREST RATES

(A VARIANCE/ CO-VARIANCE TECHNIQUE). THESE

INTERRELATIONSHIPS ARE A FUNCTION OF FOREIGN EXCHANGE CURRENCY

MARKET CHANGES AND INTEREST RATE CHANGES OVER THE PRECEDING ONE

YEAR. THE VALUE OF FOREIGN CURRENCY OPTIONS DOES NOT CHANGE ON A

ONE-TO-ONE BASIS WITH CHANGES IN THE UNDERLYING CURRENCY RATE.

WE ADJUSTED THE POTENTIAL LOSS IN OPTION VALUE FOR THE ESTIMATED

SENSITIVITY (THE DELTA AND GAMMA) TO

CHANGES IN THE UNDERLYING CURRENCY RATE. THIS CALCULATION

REFLECTS THE IMPACT OF FOREIGN CURRENCY RATE FLUCTUATIONS ON THE

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS ONLY, AND HENCE DOES NOT INCLUDE THE

IMPACT OF SUCH RATE FLUCTUATIONS ON THE UNDERLYING BASED

TRANSACTIONS THAT ARE ANTICIPATED TRANSACTIONS, FIRM

COMMITMENTS, CASH BALANCES AND ACCOUNTS AND LOANS RECEIVABLE AND

PAYABLE DENOMINATED IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES FROM THE VAR

CALCULATION, INCLUDING THOSE WHICH ARE HEDGED BY THESE

INSTRUMENTS.

THE VAR MODEL IS A RISK ANALYSIS TOOL AND DOES

NOT PURPORT TO REPRESENT ACTUAL LOSSES IN FAIR VALUE THAT WE

WILL INCUR, NOR DOES IT CONSIDER THE POTENTIAL EFFECT OF

FAVORABLE CHANGES IN MARKET RATES. IT ALSO DOES NOT REPRESENT

THE FULL EXTENT OF THE POSSIBLE LOSS THAT MAY OCCUR. ACTUAL

FUTURE GAINS AND LOSSES WILL DIFFER FROM THOSE ESTIMATED BECAUSE

OF CHANGES OR DIFFERENCES IN MARKET RATES AND

INTERRELATIONSHIPS, HEDGING INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGE PERCENTAGES,

TIMING AND OTHER FACTORS.

THE ESTIMATED MAXIMUM ONE-DAY LOSS IN FAIR VALUE

ON OUR FOREIGN CURRENCY SENSITIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, DERIVED

USING THE VAR MODEL, WAS $13.7 MILLION AND

$18.9 MILLION AT MAY 31, 2002 AND MAY 31, 2001,

RESPECTIVELY. THE REDUCTION IN VAR AS OF MAY 31, 2002

OCCURRED DUE TO THE EFFECT OF CURRENCY VOLATILITY ON EXISTING

TRADES ON THE MAY 31, 2002 VAR COMPUTATION VERSUS THE

EFFECT OF CURRENCY VOLATILITY ON EXISTING TRADES ON THE

MAY 31, 2001 VAR COMPUTATION. SUCH A HYPOTHETICAL LOSS IN

FAIR VALUE OF OUR DERIVATIVES WOULD BE OFFSET BY INCREASES IN

THE VALUE OF THE UNDERLYING TRANSACTIONS BEING HEDGED. THE

AVERAGE MONTHLY CHANGE IN THE FAIR VALUES OF FOREIGN CURRENCY

FORWARD AND FOREIGN CURRENCY OPTION DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS WAS

$42.9 MILLION AND $22.4 MILLION FOR FISCAL 2002 AND

FISCAL 2001, RESPECTIVELY.

DETAILS OF OTHER MARKET-SENSITIVE FINANCIAL

INSTRUMENTS AND DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS NOT INCLUDED IN

THE VAR CALCULATION ABOVE, ARE PROVIDED IN THE TABLE BELOW

EXCEPT THE INTEREST RATE SWAPS WHICH ARE DESCRIBED IN THE LAST

PARAGRAPH OF THIS SECTION. THESE INSTRUMENTS INCLUDE

INTERCOMPANY LOANS DENOMINATED IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES, FIXED

INTEREST RATE JAPANESE YEN DENOMINATED DEBT, FIXED INTEREST RATE

U.S. DOLLAR DENOMINATED DEBT, CROSS-CURRENCY SWAPS, AND

INTEREST RATE SWAPS. FOR DEBT OBLIGATIONS, THE TABLE PRESENTS

PRINCIPAL CASH FLOWS AND RELATED WEIGHTED AVERAGE INTEREST RATES

BY EXPECTED MATURITY DATES. WE HAVE EXCLUDED THE CROSS-CURRENCY

SWAPS FROM THE FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK CATEGORY BECAUSE THESE

INSTRUMENTS ELIMINATE ALL FOREIGN CURRENCY EXPOSURE IN THE CASH

FLOWS OF A EURO DENOMINATED INTERCOMPANY LOAN. WE HAVE INCLUDED

THESE CROSS-CURRENCY SWAPS IN THE INTEREST RATE RISK CATEGORY

BUT EXCLUDED THE RELATED INTERCOMPANY LOAN FROM THIS CATEGORY

BECAUSE THE INTERCOMPANY INTEREST ELIMINATES IN CONSOLIDATION.

FOR THE CROSS-CURRENCY SWAPS THE TABLE PRESENTS BOTH THE EURO

SWAP PAYABLE AND U.S. DOLLAR SWAP RECEIVABLE AND THE

RESPECTIVE PAY AND RECEIVE INTEREST RATES. ALL INFORMATION IS

PRESENTED IN U.S. DOLLAR EQUIVALENTS, IN MILLIONS, EXCEPT

INTEREST RATES.

INTERCOMPANY LOANS AND RELATED INTEREST AMOUNTS

ELIMINATE IN CONSOLIDATION. INTERCOMPANY LOANS ARE GENERALLY

HEDGED AGAINST FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK THROUGH THE USE OF FORWARD

CONTRACTS AND SWAPS WITH THIRD PARTIES.

THE FIXED INTEREST RATE JAPANESE YEN DENOMINATED

DEBTS WERE ISSUED BY AND ARE ACCOUNTED FOR BY TWO OF OUR

JAPANESE SUBSIDIARIES. ACCORDINGLY, THE MONTHLY REMEASUREMENT OF

THESE INSTRUMENTS DUE TO CHANGES IN FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES IS

RECOGNIZED IN ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE LOSS UPON THE

CONSOLIDATION OF THESE SUBSIDIARIES.

THERE WAS NOT A SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN DEBT OR

CROSS-CURRENCY SWAP MARKET RISKS DURING FISCAL 2002. THE

U.S. DOLLAR FAIR VALUES OF INTERCOMPANY LOANS DENOMINATED

IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES WAS $647.2 MILLION AT MAY 31,

2001, WHICH IS THE SAME AS THE CARRYING VALUES OF THE LOANS

PRIOR TO THEIR ELIMINATION. THE U.S. DOLLAR FAIR VALUE OF

THE FIXED RATE JAPANESE YEN DENOMINATED DEBT THAT WAS

OUTSTANDING AT MAY 31, 2001 WAS $181.1 MILLION

26

TABLE OF CONTENTS

VERSUS A CARRYING VALUE OF $191.0 MILLION AT

THAT DATE. THE U.S. DOLLAR FAIR VALUES OF THE FIXED RATE

U.S. DOLLAR DENOMINATED DEBT, THE EURO SWAP PAYABLE AND THE

U.S. DOLLAR SWAP RECEIVABLE AS OF MAY 31, 2001 WERE

$256.2 MILLION, $179.4 MILLION AND

$266.4 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, VERSUS CARRYING VALUES OF

$249.6 MILLION, $172.6 MILLION AND

$250.0 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, AT THAT DATE.

IN AUGUST 2001, WE ISSUED A $250 MILLION

CORPORATE BOND MATURING IN AUGUST 2006, WITH A FIXED INTEREST

RATE OF 5.5%. IN NOVEMBER 2001, WE ENTERED INTO RECEIVE-FIXED

PAY-VARIABLE INTEREST RATE SWAP AGREEMENTS TO HEDGE THE INTEREST

RATE EXPOSURE RELATED TO THIS BOND. THE INTEREST RATE SWAPS HAVE

AN AGGREGATE NOTIONAL AMOUNT OF $250 MILLION MATURING IN

AUGUST 2006. THE RECEIVE-FIXED RATES ON THE SWAPS MATCH THE

FIXED RATE ON THE BOND, AND THE PAY-VARIABLE RATES ARE BASED ON

THE THREE-MONTH LIBOR RATES PLUS A SPREAD. AS A RESULT OF THE

INTEREST RATE SWAP AGREEMENTS, OUR EFFECTIVE INTEREST RATE ON

THE $250 MILLION CORPORATE BOND WAS 3.3% AS OF MAY 31,

2002. THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE CARRYING AMOUNTS AND FAIR VALUE

OF THE CORPORATE BOND AND RELATED INTEREST RATE SWAPS WAS

$1.8 MILLION AT MAY 31, 2002.

NOTE 1  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT

ACCOUNTING POLICIES

BASIS OF CONSOLIDATION

THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDE THE

ACCOUNTS OF NIKE, INC. AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES (THE COMPANY). ALL

SIGNIFICANT INTERCOMPANY TRANSACTIONS AND BALANCES HAVE BEEN

ELIMINATED.

RECOGNITION OF REVENUES

WHOLESALE REVENUES ARE RECOGNIZED WHEN TITLE

PASSES AND THE RISKS AND REWARDS OF OWNERSHIP HAVE PASSED TO THE

CUSTOMER, BASED ON THE TERMS OF SALE. TITLE PASSES GENERALLY

UPON SHIPMENT OR UPON RECEIPT BY THE CUSTOMER DEPENDING ON THE

COUNTRY OF THE SALE AND THE AGREEMENT WITH THE CUSTOMER. RETAIL

STORE REVENUES ARE RECORDED AT THE TIME OF SALE. PROVISIONS FOR

SALES DISCOUNTS AND RETURNS ARE MADE AT THE TIME OF SALE.

SHIPPING AND HANDLING COSTS

SHIPPING AND HANDLING COSTS ARE EXPENSED AS

INCURRED AND INCLUDED IN COST OF SALES.

ADVERTISING AND PROMOTION

ADVERTISING PRODUCTION COSTS ARE EXPENSED THE

FIRST TIME THE ADVERTISEMENT IS RUN. MEDIA (TV AND PRINT)

PLACEMENT COSTS ARE EXPENSED IN THE MONTH THE ADVERTISING

APPEARS. A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF THE COMPANYS PROMOTIONAL

EXPENSES RESULT FROM PAYMENTS UNDER ENDORSEMENT CONTRACTS.

ACCOUNTING FOR ENDORSEMENT PAYMENTS IS BASED UPON SPECIFIC

CONTRACT PROVISIONS. GENERALLY, ENDORSEMENT PAYMENTS ARE

EXPENSED UNIFORMLY OVER THE TERM OF THE CONTRACT AFTER GIVING

RECOGNITION TO PERIODIC PERFORMANCE COMPLIANCE PROVISIONS OF THE

CONTRACTS. PREPAYMENTS MADE UNDER CONTRACTS ARE INCLUDED IN

PREPAID EXPENSES AND OTHER CURRENT ASSETS OR OTHER ASSETS

DEPENDING ON THE LENGTH OF THE CONTRACT. THROUGH COOPERATIVE

ADVERTISING PROGRAMS, WE REIMBURSE OUR RETAIL CUSTOMERS FOR

CERTAIN OF THEIR COSTS OF ADVERTISING OUR PRODUCTS. WE RECORD

THESE COSTS IN SELLING AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE AT THE POINT

IN TIME WHEN WE ARE OBLIGATED TO OUR CUSTOMERS FOR THE COSTS.

THIS OBLIGATION MAY ARISE PRIOR TO THE RELATED ADVERTISEMENT

BEING RUN. TOTAL ADVERTISING AND PROMOTION EXPENSES WERE

$1,027.9 MILLION, $998.2 MILLION AND

$974.1 MILLION FOR THE YEARS ENDED MAY 31, 2002, 2001

AND 2000, RESPECTIVELY. INCLUDED IN PREPAID EXPENSES AND OTHER

CURRENT ASSETS AND OTHER ASSETS WAS $113.2 MILLION AND

$122.3 MILLION AT MAY 31, 2002 AND 2001, RESPECTIVELY,

RELATING TO PREPAID ADVERTISING AND PROMOTION EXPENSES.

CASH AND EQUIVALENTS

CASH AND EQUIVALENTS REPRESENT CASH AND

SHORT-TERM, HIGHLY LIQUID INVESTMENTS WITH ORIGINAL MATURITIES

OF THREE MONTHS OR LESS.

INVENTORY VALUATION

INVENTORIES ARE STATED AT THE LOWER OF COST OR

MARKET. INVENTORIES ARE VALUED ON A FIRST-IN, FIRST-OUT (FIFO)

OR MOVING-AVERAGE COST BASIS.

PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT AND

DEPRECIATION

PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT ARE RECORDED AT

COST. DEPRECIATION FOR FINANCIAL REPORTING PURPOSES IS

DETERMINED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS FOR BUILDINGS AND LEASEHOLD

IMPROVEMENTS OVER 2 TO 40 YEARS AND PRINCIPALLY ON A

DECLINING BALANCE BASIS FOR MACHINERY AND EQUIPMENT OVER 2 TO

15 YEARS. COMPUTER SOFTWARE IS DEPRECIATED ON A

STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER 3 TO 10 YEARS.

IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND

GOODWILL

AT MAY 31, 2002 AND 2001, THE COMPANY HAD

PATENTS, TRADEMARKS AND OTHER IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS

RECORDED AT A COST OF $264.2 MILLION AND $218.6 MILLION,

RESPECTIVELY. THE COMPANYS EXCESS OF PURCHASE COST OVER

THE FAIR VALUE OF NET ASSETS OF BUSINESSES ACQUIRED

(GOODWILL) WAS $333.6 MILLION AND $322.5 MILLION

AT MAY 31, 2002 AND 2001, RESPECTIVELY.

IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND GOODWILL ARE

BEING AMORTIZED OVER THEIR ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES ON A

STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER FIVE TO FORTY YEARS. ACCUMULATED

AMORTIZATION WAS $160.0 MILLION AND $143.8 MILLION AT

MAY 31, 2002 AND 2001, RESPECTIVELY. AMORTIZATION EXPENSE,

WHICH IS INCLUDED IN OTHER INCOME/EXPENSE, WAS

$15.7 MILLION, $15.6 MILLION AND $18.5 MILLION

FOR THE YEARS ENDED MAY 31, 2002, 2001 AND 2000,

RESPECTIVELY.

IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED

ASSETS

WHEN EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THE

CARRYING VALUE OF A LONG-LIVED ASSET MAY BE IMPAIRED, THE

COMPANY ESTIMATES THE FUTURE UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS TO BE

DERIVED FROM THE ASSET TO ASSESS WHETHER OR NOT A POTENTIAL

IMPAIRMENT EXISTS. IF THE CARRYING VALUE EXCEEDS OUR ESTIMATE OF

FUTURE UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS, WE THEN CALCULATE THE IMPAIRMENT

AS THE EXCESS OF THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE ASSET OVER OUR

ESTIMATE OF ITS FAIR MARKET VALUE.

FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION AND FOREIGN

CURRENCY TRANSACTIONS

ADJUSTMENTS RESULTING FROM TRANSLATING FOREIGN

FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INTO U.S. DOLLARS ARE

INCLUDED IN THE FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENT, A

COMPONENT OF ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE LOSS IN

SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY.

TRANSACTION GAINS AND LOSSES GENERATED BY THE

EFFECT OF FOREIGN EXCHANGE ON RECORDED ASSETS AND LIABILITIES

DENOMINATED IN A CURRENCY DIFFERENT FROM THE FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY

OF THE APPLICABLE COMPANY ENTITY ARE RECORDED IN OTHER

INCOME/EXPENSE CURRENTLY.

NET FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSACTION GAINS, WHICH

INCLUDE TRANSACTION GAINS AND LOSSES REFERRED TO ABOVE AS WELL

AS HEDGE RESULTS CAPTURED IN REVENUES, COST OF SALES, SELLING

AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE AND OTHER INCOME/EXPENSE, WERE

$45.1 MILLION, $129.6 MILLION, AND $36.1 MILLION

FOR THE YEARS ENDED MAY 31, 2002, 2001, AND 2000

RESPECTIVELY.

ADOPTION OF FAS 133

THE COMPANY ADOPTED STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL

ACCOUNTING STANDARDS (SFAS) NO. 133,

ACCOUNTING FOR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING

ACTIVITIES, AS AMENDED BY SFAS NO. 138,

ACCOUNTING FOR CERTAIN DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND CERTAIN

HEDGING ACTIVITIES (FAS 133) ON JUNE 1, 2001.

IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE TRANSITION PROVISIONS OF

FAS 133, THE COMPANY RECORDED A ONE-TIME TRANSITION

ADJUSTMENT AS OF JUNE 1, 2001 ON BOTH THE CONSOLIDATED

STATEMENT OF INCOME AND THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET. THE

TRANSITION ADJUSTMENT ON THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF INCOME

WAS A CHARGE OF $5.0 MILLION, NET OF TAX EFFECT. THIS

AMOUNT RELATED TO AN INVESTMENT THAT WAS ADJUSTED TO FAIR VALUE

IN ACCORDANCE WITH FAS 133. THE TRANSITION ADJUSTMENT ON

THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET REPRESENTED THE INITIAL

RECOGNITION OF THE FAIR VALUES OF HEDGE DERIVATIVES OUTSTANDING

ON THE ADOPTION DATE AND REALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES ON EFFECTIVE

HEDGES FOR WHICH THE UNDERLYING EXPOSURE HAD NOT YET AFFECTED

EARNINGS. THE TRANSITION ADJUSTMENT ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE

SHEET WAS AN INCREASE IN CURRENT ASSETS OF $116.4 MILLION,

AN INCREASE IN NONCURRENT ASSETS OF $87.0 MILLION, AN

INCREASE IN CURRENT LIABILITIES OF $151.6 MILLION, AND AN

INCREASE IN OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME OF APPROXIMATELY

$56.8 MILLION, NET OF TAX EFFECT. THE MAJORITY OF THE

$56.8 MILLION RECORDED IN OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME AS OF

JUNE 1, 2001 RELATED TO OUTSTANDING DERIVATIVES AT THAT

DATE. BECAUSE EXCHANGE RATES ON THE TRANSITION DATE WERE

DIFFERENT FROM THOSE ON THE MATURITY DATES OF THESE DERIVATIVES

AND BECAUSE

36

TABLE OF CONTENTS

NIKE, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS  (CONTINUED)

SOME CONTRACTS MATURING DURING THE YEAR ENDED

MAY 31, 2002 WERE ENTERED INTO AFTER THE TRANSITION DATE,

AMOUNTS ULTIMATELY RECLASSIFIED TO EARNINGS DURING THE YEAR

ENDED MAY 31, 2002, AS DESCRIBED IN NOTE 12, ARE

SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT FROM THIS AMOUNT.

ACCOUNTING FOR DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING

ACTIVITIES

THE PURPOSE OF THE COMPANYS FOREIGN

CURRENCY HEDGING ACTIVITIES IS TO PROTECT THE COMPANY FROM THE

RISK THAT THE EVENTUAL CASH FLOWS RESULTING FROM TRANSACTIONS IN

FOREIGN CURRENCIES, INCLUDING REVENUES, PRODUCT COSTS, SELLING

AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES, AND INTERCOMPANY TRANSACTIONS,

INCLUDING INTERCOMPANY BORROWINGS, WILL BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY

CHANGES IN EXCHANGE RATES. THE COMPANY DOES NOT HOLD OR ISSUE

DERIVATIVES FOR TRADING PURPOSES. IT IS THE COMPANYS

POLICY TO UTILIZE DERIVATIVES TO REDUCE FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISKS

WHERE INTERNAL NETTING STRATEGIES CANNOT BE EFFECTIVELY

EMPLOYED. FLUCTUATIONS IN THE VALUE OF HEDGING INSTRUMENTS ARE

OFFSET BY FLUCTUATIONS IN THE VALUE OF THE UNDERLYING EXPOSURES

BEING HEDGED.

DERIVATIVES USED BY THE COMPANY TO HEDGE THE

RISKS DESCRIBED ABOVE ARE FORWARD EXCHANGE CONTRACTS, OPTIONS

AND CROSS-CURRENCY SWAPS. THESE INSTRUMENTS PROTECT AGAINST THE

RISK THAT THE EVENTUAL NET CASH INFLOWS AND OUTFLOWS FROM

FOREIGN CURRENCY DENOMINATED TRANSACTIONS WILL BE ADVERSELY

AFFECTED BY CHANGES IN EXCHANGE RATES. THE CROSS-CURRENCY SWAPS

ARE USED TO HEDGE FOREIGN CURRENCY DENOMINATED PAYMENTS RELATED

TO INTERCOMPANY LOAN AGREEMENTS. HEDGED TRANSACTIONS ARE

DENOMINATED PRIMARILY IN EUROPEAN CURRENCIES, JAPANESE YEN,

CANADIAN DOLLARS, KOREAN WON, MEXICAN PESOS, AUSTRALIAN DOLLARS,

AND NEW TAIWAN DOLLARS. THE COMPANY HEDGES UP TO 100% OF

ANTICIPATED EXPOSURES TYPICALLY TWELVE MONTHS IN ADVANCE BUT HAS

HEDGED AS MUCH AS 32 MONTHS IN ADVANCE. WHEN INTERCOMPANY

LOANS ARE HEDGED, IT IS TYPICALLY FOR THEIR EXPECTED DURATION,

WHICH IN SOME CIRCUMSTANCES MAY BE IN EXCESS OF FIVE YEARS.

THE COMPANY IS ALSO EXPOSED TO THE RISK OF

CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF CERTAIN FIXED-RATE DEBT

ATTRIBUTABLE TO CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES. DERIVATIVES CURRENTLY

USED BY THE COMPANY TO HEDGE THIS RISK ARE RECEIVE-FIXED,

PAY-VARIABLE INTEREST RATE SWAPS. SEE NOTE 5.

ALL DERIVATIVES ARE RECOGNIZED ON THE BALANCE

SHEET AT THEIR FAIR VALUE. UNREALIZED GAIN POSITIONS ARE

RECORDED AS OTHER CURRENT ASSETS OR OTHER NON-CURRENT ASSETS.

UNREALIZED LOSS POSITIONS ARE RECORDED AS ACCRUED LIABILITIES OR

OTHER NON-CURRENT LIABILITIES.

THE FAIR VALUES OF THE INTEREST RATE SWAP

AGREEMENTS ARE RECORDED AS OTHER NON-CURRENT ASSETS OR OTHER

NON-CURRENT LIABILITIES. THE UNREALIZED GAIN OR LOSS ON THE

INTEREST RATE SWAPS IS EXACTLY OFFSET BY AN UNREALIZED LOSS OR

GAIN ON THE UNDERLYING LONG-TERM DEBT.

SUBSTANTIALLY ALL FOREIGN CURRENCY DERIVATIVES

ENTERED INTO BY THE COMPANY QUALIFY FOR AND ARE DESIGNATED AS

FOREIGN-CURRENCY CASH FLOW HEDGES, INCLUDING THOSE HEDGING

FOREIGN CURRENCY DENOMINATED FIRM COMMITMENTS.

THE INTEREST RATE SWAP AGREEMENTS ARE DESIGNATED

AS FAIR VALUE HEDGES OF THE RELATED LONG-TERM DEBT AND MEET THE

SHORTCUT METHOD REQUIREMENTS UNDER FAS 133. ACCORDINGLY,

INTEREST EXPENSE ON THE RELATED LONG-TERM DEBT IS RECORDED BASED

ON THE VARIABLE RATES PAID UNDER THE INTEREST RATE SWAP

AGREEMENTS, AND CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUES OF THE INTEREST RATE

SWAP AGREEMENTS EXACTLY OFFSET CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE

LONG-TERM DEBT.

THE COMPANY CONSIDERS WHETHER ANY PROVISIONS IN

NON-DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS REPRESENT EMBEDDED

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AS DESCRIBED IN FAS 133. FOR THE

PERIOD ENDED MAY 31, 2002 THE COMPANY HAS CONCLUDED THAT NO

EMBEDDED DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS WARRANT SEPARATE

FAIR VALUE ACCOUNTING UNDER FAS 133.

CHANGES IN FAIR VALUES OF OUTSTANDING CASH FLOW

HEDGE DERIVATIVES THAT ARE HIGHLY EFFECTIVE ARE RECORDED IN

OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME, UNTIL EARNINGS ARE AFFECTED BY THE

VARIABILITY OF CASH FLOWS OF THE HEDGED TRANSACTION. IN MOST

CASES AMOUNTS RECORDED IN OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME WILL BE

RELEASED TO EARNINGS SOME TIME AFTER THE MATURITY OF THE RELATED

DERIVATIVE. THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF INCOME CLASSIFICATION

OF

37

TABLE OF CONTENTS

NIKE, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS  (CONTINUED)

EFFECTIVE HEDGE RESULTS IS THE SAME AS THAT OF

THE UNDERLYING EXPOSURE. RESULTS OF HEDGES OF REVENUE AND

PRODUCT COSTS ARE RECORDED IN REVENUE AND COST OF SALES,

RESPECTIVELY, WHEN THE UNDERLYING HEDGED TRANSACTION AFFECTS

EARNINGS. RESULTS OF HEDGES OF SELLING AND ADMINISTRATIVE

EXPENSE ARE RECORDED TOGETHER WITH THOSE COSTS WHEN THE RELATED

EXPENSE IS RECORDED. RESULTS OF HEDGES OF ANTICIPATED

INTERCOMPANY TRANSACTIONS ARE RECORDED IN OTHER INCOME/EXPENSE

WHEN THE TRANSACTION OCCURS. HEDGES OF RECORDED BALANCE SHEET

POSITIONS ARE RECORDED IN OTHER INCOME/EXPENSE CURRENTLY

TOGETHER WITH THE TRANSACTION GAIN OR LOSS FROM THE HEDGED

BALANCE SHEET POSITION. UNREALIZED DERIVATIVE GAINS AND LOSSES

RECORDED IN CURRENT AND NON-CURRENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AND

AMOUNTS RECORDED IN OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME ARE NON-CASH

ITEMS AND THEREFORE ARE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT IN THE PREPARATION OF

THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS BASED ON THEIR

RESPECTIVE BALANCE SHEET CLASSIFICATIONS.

THE CRITICAL TERMS OF THE COMPANYS

OUTSTANDING INTEREST RATE SWAP AGREEMENTS EXACTLY MATCH THE

CRITICAL TERMS OF THE UNDERLYING DEBT. THEREFORE, UNDER THE

SHORTCUT PROVISIONS OF FAS 133, THE SWAPS ARE CONSIDERED

PERFECTLY EFFECTIVE.

THE COMPANY FORMALLY DOCUMENTS ALL RELATIONSHIPS

BETWEEN HEDGING INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGED ITEMS, AS WELL AS ITS

RISK-MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVE AND STRATEGY FOR UNDERTAKING HEDGE

TRANSACTIONS. THIS PROCESS INCLUDES LINKING ALL DERIVATIVES THAT

ARE DESIGNATED AS FOREIGN-CURRENCY CASH FLOW HEDGES TO EITHER

SPECIFIC ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ON THE BALANCE SHEET OR SPECIFIC

FIRM COMMITMENTS OR FORECASTED TRANSACTIONS. THE COMPANY ALSO

FORMALLY ASSESSES, BOTH AT THE HEDGES INCEPTION AND ON AN

ONGOING BASIS, WHETHER THE DERIVATIVES THAT ARE USED IN HEDGING

TRANSACTIONS HAVE BEEN HIGHLY EFFECTIVE IN OFFSETTING CHANGES IN

THE CASH FLOWS OF HEDGED ITEMS AND WHETHER THOSE DERIVATIVES MAY

BE EXPECTED TO REMAIN HIGHLY EFFECTIVE IN FUTURE PERIODS. WHEN

IT IS DETERMINED THAT A DERIVATIVE IS NOT, OR HAS CEASED TO BE,

HIGHLY EFFECTIVE AS A HEDGE, THE COMPANY DISCONTINUES HEDGE

ACCOUNTING PROSPECTIVELY, AS DISCUSSED BELOW.

THE COMPANY DISCONTINUES HEDGE ACCOUNTING

PROSPECTIVELY WHEN (1) IT DETERMINES THAT THE DERIVATIVE IS

NO LONGER HIGHLY EFFECTIVE IN OFFSETTING CHANGES IN THE CASH

FLOWS OF A HEDGED ITEM (INCLUDING HEDGED ITEMS SUCH AS FIRM

COMMITMENTS OR FORECASTED TRANSACTIONS); (2) THE DERIVATIVE

EXPIRES OR IS SOLD, TERMINATED, OR EXERCISED; (3) IT IS NO

LONGER PROBABLE THAT THE FORECASTED TRANSACTION WILL OCCUR; OR

(4) MANAGEMENT DETERMINES THAT DESIGNATING THE DERIVATIVE

AS A HEDGING INSTRUMENT IS NO LONGER APPROPRIATE.

WHEN THE COMPANY DISCONTINUES HEDGE ACCOUNTING

BECAUSE IT IS NO LONGER PROBABLE THAT THE FORECASTED TRANSACTION

WILL OCCUR IN THE ORIGINALLY EXPECTED PERIOD, THE GAIN OR LOSS

ON THE DERIVATIVE REMAINS IN ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE

INCOME AND IS RECLASSIFIED INTO EARNINGS WHEN THE FORECASTED

TRANSACTION AFFECTS EARNINGS. HOWEVER, IF IT IS PROBABLE THAT A

FORECASTED TRANSACTION WILL NOT OCCUR BY THE END OF THE

ORIGINALLY SPECIFIED TIME PERIOD OR WITHIN AN ADDITIONAL

TWO-MONTH PERIOD OF TIME THEREAFTER, THE GAINS AND LOSSES THAT

WERE ACCUMULATED IN OTHER COMPREHENSIVE LOSS WILL BE RECOGNIZED

IMMEDIATELY IN EARNINGS. IN ALL SITUATIONS IN WHICH HEDGE

ACCOUNTING IS DISCONTINUED AND THE DERIVATIVE REMAINS

OUTSTANDING, THE COMPANY WILL CARRY THE DERIVATIVE AT ITS FAIR

VALUE ON THE BALANCE SHEET, RECOGNIZING FUTURE CHANGES IN THE

FAIR VALUE IN CURRENT-PERIOD EARNINGS. ANY HEDGE INEFFECTIVENESS

IS RECORDED IN CURRENT-PERIOD EARNINGS. EFFECTIVENESS IS

ASSESSED BASED ON FORWARD RATES.

PREMIUMS PAID ON OPTIONS ARE INITIALLY RECORDED

AS DEFERRED CHARGES. THE COMPANY ASSESSES EFFECTIVENESS ON

OPTIONS BASED ON THE TOTAL CASH FLOWS METHOD AND RECORDS TOTAL

CHANGES IN THE OPTIONS FAIR VALUE TO OTHER COMPREHENSIVE

INCOME TO THE DEGREE THEY ARE EFFECTIVE.

INCOME TAXES

UNITED STATES INCOME TAXES ARE PROVIDED CURRENTLY

ON FINANCIAL STATEMENT EARNINGS OF NON-U.S. SUBSIDIARIES

EXPECTED TO BE REPATRIATED. THE COMPANY DETERMINES ANNUALLY THE

AMOUNT OF UNDISTRIBUTED NON-U.S. EARNINGS TO INVEST

INDEFINITELY IN ITS NON-U.S. OPERATIONS. THE COMPANY

ACCOUNTS FOR INCOME TAXES USING THE ASSET AND LIABILITY METHOD.

THIS APPROACH REQUIRES THE RECOGNITION OF DEFERRED TAX ASSETS

CONSEQUENCES OF TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE CARRYING

AMOUNTS AND THE TAX BASES OF OTHER ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. SEE

NOTE 6 FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION.

EARNINGS PER SHARE

BASIC EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE IS CALCULATED BY

DIVIDING NET INCOME BY THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE NUMBER OF COMMON

SHARES OUTSTANDING DURING THE YEAR. DILUTED EARNINGS PER COMMON

SHARE IS CALCULATED BY ADJUSTING WEIGHTED AVERAGE OUTSTANDING

SHARES, ASSUMING CONVERSION OF ALL POTENTIALLY DILUTIVE STOCK

OPTIONS AND AWARDS. SEE NOTE 9 FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION.

MANAGEMENT ESTIMATES

THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN

CONFORMITY WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES

REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO MAKE ESTIMATES, INCLUDING ESTIMATES

RELATING TO ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF

ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AND DISCLOSURE OF CONTINGENT ASSETS AND

LIABILITIES AT THE DATE OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND THE REPORTED

AMOUNTS OF REVENUES AND EXPENSES DURING THE REPORTING PERIOD.

ACTUAL RESULTS COULD DIFFER FROM THESE ESTIMATES.

RECLASSIFICATIONS

CERTAIN PRIOR YEAR AMOUNTS HAVE BEEN RECLASSIFIED

TO CONFORM TO FISCAL YEAR 2002 PRESENTATION. THESE CHANGES HAD

NO IMPACT ON PREVIOUSLY REPORTED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR

SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY.

RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING

STANDARDS

THE COMPANY WILL ADOPT SFAS NO. 142,

GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS (FAS 142)

ON JUNE 1, 2002. FAS 142 REQUIRES THAT GOODWILL AND

INTANGIBLE ASSETS WITH INDEFINITE LIVES NO LONGER BE AMORTIZED

BUT INSTEAD BE MEASURED FOR IMPAIRMENT AT LEAST ANNUALLY, OR

WHEN EVENTS INDICATE THAT AN IMPAIRMENT EXISTS. AS OF THE

ADOPTION DATE, AMORTIZATION OF OUTSTANDING GOODWILL AND OTHER

INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS WILL CEASE. AS A RESULT OF

THE ELIMINATION OF THIS AMORTIZATION, OTHER EXPENSE WILL

DECREASE BY APPROXIMATELY $13 MILLION ANNUALLY BEGINNING IN

THE QUARTER ENDED AUGUST 31, 2002.

AS REQUIRED BY FAS 142, WE WILL PERFORM

IMPAIRMENT TESTS ON GOODWILL AND OTHER INDEFINITE-LIVED

INTANGIBLE ASSETS AS OF THE ADOPTION DATE. THEREAFTER, WE WILL

PERFORM IMPAIRMENT TESTS ANNUALLY AND WHENEVER EVENTS OR

CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THAT THE VALUE OF GOODWILL OR OTHER

INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS MIGHT BE IMPAIRED. IN

CONNECTION WITH THE FAS 142 INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE

ASSET IMPAIRMENT TEST, WE WILL UTILIZE THE REQUIRED ONE-STEP

METHOD TO DETERMINE WHETHER AN IMPAIRMENT EXISTS AS OF THE

ADOPTION DATE. IN CONNECTION WITH THE FAS 142 TRANSITIONAL

GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT TEST, WE WILL UTILIZE THE REQUIRED TWO-STEP

METHOD FOR DETERMINING GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT AS OF THE ADOPTION

DATE.

WE HAVE ESTIMATED THAT WE WILL LIKELY INCUR A

TRANSITIONAL IMPAIRMENT LOSS OF APPROXIMATELY $270 MILLION

RELATED TO OUR BAUER NIKE HOCKEY AND COLE HAAN SUBSIDIARIES,

REFLECTING THAT THE FAIR VALUES WE HAVE ESTIMATED FOR THESE

SUBSIDIARIES ARE LESS THAN THE CARRYING VALUES INCLUDING

GOODWILL. THIS EXPECTED TRANSITIONAL IMPAIRMENT LOSS WILL BE

RECOGNIZED AS A CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF A CHANGE IN ACCOUNTING

PRINCIPLE IN OUR CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF INCOME DURING THE

QUARTER ENDED AUGUST 31, 2002.

IN OCTOBER 2001, THE FASB ISSUED

SFAS NO. 144, ACCOUNTING FOR THE IMPAIRMENT OR

DISPOSAL OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS (FAS 144). THIS

STATEMENT SUPERSEDES SFAS NO. 121, ACCOUNTING

FOR THE IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS AND FOR LONG-LIVED

ASSETS TO BE DISPOSED OF (FAS 121), AND AMENDS

ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES BOARD STATEMENT NO. 30,

REPORTING THE EFFECTS OF DISPOSAL OF A SEGMENT OF A

BUSINESS, AND EXTRAORDINARY, UNUSUAL AND INFREQUENTLY OCCURRING

EVENTS AND TRANSACTIONS (APB 30). FAS 144

REQUIRES THAT LONG-LIVED ASSETS THAT ARE TO BE DISPOSED OF BY

SALE BE MEASURED AT THE LOWER OF BOOK VALUE OR FAIR VALUE LESS

COSTS TO SELL. FAS 144 RETAINS THE FUNDAMENTAL PROVISIONS OF

FAS 121 FOR (A) RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT OF

APB 30S REQUIREMENT THAT COMPANIES REPORT

DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS SEPARATELY FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS.

ALL PROVISIONS OF THIS STATEMENT WILL BE EFFECTIVE FOR THE

COMPANY ON JUNE 1, 2003. IT IS NOT EXPECTED THAT THE

ADOPTION OF FAS 144 WILL HAVE ANY IMPACT ON THE

COMPANYS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL POSITION OR RESULTS OF

THE COMPANY PURCHASES THROUGH NIAC CERTAIN

ATHLETIC FOOTWEAR AND APPAREL IT ACQUIRES FROM NON-U.S.

SUPPLIERS. THESE PURCHASES ARE FOR THE COMPANYS OPERATIONS

OUTSIDE OF THE U.S., EUROPE, AND JAPAN. ACCOUNTS PAYABLE TO NIAC

ARE GENERALLY DUE UP TO 60 DAYS AFTER SHIPMENT OF GOODS

IN FEBRUARY 1999, THE COMPANY FILED A SHELF

REGISTRATION WITH THE U.S. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE

COMMISSION (SEC) FOR THE SALE OF UP TO

$500.0 MILLION IN DEBT SECURITIES. IN AUGUST 2001, WE

ISSUED A $250.0 MILLION CORPORATE BOND UNDER THIS SHELF

REGISTRATION, MATURING IN AUGUST 2006, WITH AN INTEREST RATE OF

5.5%. WITH THE PROCEEDS, WE REDUCED THE AMOUNT OF COMMERCIAL

PAPER OUTSTANDING. IN NOVEMBER 2001 THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO

INTEREST RATE SWAP AGREEMENTS TOTALING $250 MILLION AND

MATURING AUGUST 2006, WHEREBY THE COMPANY RECEIVES FIXED

INTEREST PAYMENTS AT 5.5% AND PAYS VARIABLE INTEREST PAYMENTS

BASED ON THE THREE-MONTH LIBOR PLUS A SPREAD. AT MAY 31,

2002, THE INTEREST RATES PAYABLE ON THE SWAP AGREEMENTS WERE

APPROXIMATELY 3.3%.

WE HAVE AN EFFECTIVE SHELF REGISTRATION STATEMENT

WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION FOR $1 BILLION

OF DEBT SECURITIES. AS OF MAY 31, 2002, WE HAD NOT ISSUED

ANY DEBT UNDER THE REGISTRATION STATEMENT. SUBSEQUENT TO

MAY 31, 2002, WE ISSUED A TOTAL OF $90.0 MILLION IN NOTES

UNDER THE MEDIUM TERM NOTE PROGRAM OF THE SHELF REGISTRATION.

THE NOTES HAVE COUPON RATES THAT RANGE FROM 4.80% TO 5.66%. THE

MATURITIES RANGE FROM JULY 9, 2007 TO AUGUST 7, 2012.

FOR $75 MILLION OF THE NOTES, WE SIMULTANEOUSLY ENTERED

INTO INTEREST RATE SWAP AGREEMENTS WHEREBY WE RECEIVE FIXED

INTEREST PAYMENTS AT THE SAME RATE AS THE NOTES AND PAY VARIABLE

INTEREST PAYMENTS BASED ON THE SIX-MONTH LIBOR PLUS A SPREAD.

EACH SWAP HAS THE SAME NOTIONAL AMOUNT AND MATURITY DATE AS THE

CORRESPONDING NOTE. AFTER ISSUANCE OF THESE NOTES,

ON WORKING CAPITAL AND GENERAL CORPORATE NEEDS.

IN JUNE 1996, ONE OF THE COMPANYS JAPANESE

SUBSIDIARIES BORROWED 10,500 MILLION JAPANESE YEN IN A

WITH RESPECT TO THE ELECTION OF DIRECTORS.

IN 1990, THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS ADOPTED, AND THE

SHAREHOLDERS APPROVED, THE NIKE, INC. 1990 STOCK INCENTIVE PLAN

(THE 1990 PLAN). THE 1990 PLAN PROVIDES FOR THE

ISSUANCE OF UP TO 37.5 MILLION SHARES OF CLASS B

COMMON STOCK IN CONNECTION WITH STOCK OPTIONS AND OTHER AWARDS

GRANTED UNDER SUCH PLAN. THE 1990 PLAN AUTHORIZES THE GRANT OF

INCENTIVE STOCK OPTIONS, NON-STATUTORY STOCK OPTIONS, STOCK

APPRECIATION RIGHTS, STOCK BONUSES AND THE SALE OF RESTRICTED

STOCK. THE EXERCISE PRICE FOR INCENTIVE STOCK OPTIONS MAY NOT BE

LESS THAN THE FAIR MARKET VALUE OF THE UNDERLYING SHARES ON THE

DATE OF GRANT. THE EXERCISE PRICE FOR NON-STATUTORY STOCK

OPTIONS, STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS AND THE PURCHASE PRICE OF

RESTRICTED STOCK MAY NOT BE LESS THAN 75% OF THE FAIR MARKET

VALUE OF THE UNDERLYING SHARES ON THE DATE OF GRANT. NO

CONSIDERATION WILL BE PAID FOR STOCK BONUSES AWARDED UNDER THE

1990 PLAN. A COMMITTEE OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS ADMINISTERS THE

1990 PLAN. THE COMMITTEE HAS THE AUTHORITY TO DETERMINE THE

EMPLOYEES TO WHOM AWARDS WILL BE MADE, THE AMOUNT OF THE AWARDS,

AND THE OTHER TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THE AWARDS. AS OF

MAY 31, 2002, THE COMMITTEE HAS GRANTED SUBSTANTIALLY ALL

NON-STATUTORY STOCK OPTIONS AT 100% OF FAIR MARKET VALUE ON THE

DATE OF GRANT UNDER THE 1990 PLAN.

FROM TIME TO TIME, THE COMPANY GRANTS RESTRICTED

STOCK AND UNRESTRICTED STOCK TO KEY EMPLOYEES UNDER THE 1990

PLAN. THE NUMBER OF SHARES GRANTED TO EMPLOYEES DURING THE YEARS

ENDED MAY 31, 2002 AND MAY 31, 2001 WAS NOT MATERIAL.

DURING THE YEAR ENDED MAY 31, 2000, THE COMPANY GRANTED

427,000 SHARES OF RESTRICTED STOCK AT A MARKET VALUE OF

$27.69 PER SHARE. THE RESTRICTIONS LAPSE AND RECIPIENTS OF THE

RESTRICTED SHARES BECOME VESTED IN THE SHARES OVER A THREE-YEAR

PERIOD FROM THE DATE OF GRANT. THE SHARES ARE SUBJECT TO PARTIAL

FORFEITURE IF EMPLOYMENT TERMINATES WITHIN THE THREE-YEAR

PERIOD. RECIPIENTS OF RESTRICTED SHARES ARE ENTITLED TO CASH

DIVIDENDS AND TO VOTE THEIR RESPECTIVE SHARES. THE VALUE OF ALL

OF THE RESTRICTED SHARES WAS ESTABLISHED BY THE MARKET PRICE ON

THE DATE OF GRANT. UNEARNED COMPENSATION WAS CHARGED FOR THE

MARKET VALUE OF THE RESTRICTED SHARES. THE UNEARNED COMPENSATION

IS SHOWN AS A REDUCTION OF SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY AND

ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE RELATED TO THE GRANTS, NET OF FORFEITURES.

DURING THE YEARS ENDED MAY 31, 2002, 2001

AND 2000, THE COMPANY ALSO GRANTED SHARES OF RESTRICTED STOCK

UNDER THE LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLAN (LTIP), ADOPTED

BY THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND APPROVED BY SHAREHOLDERS IN

SEPTEMBER 1997. UNDER THE LTIP, AWARDS ARE MADE TO CERTAIN

EXECUTIVES BASED ON PERFORMANCE TARGETS ESTABLISHED OVER VARYING

TIME PERIODS. ONCE PERFORMANCE TARGETS ARE ACHIEVED, THE SHARES

OF STOCK ARE ISSUED AND, FOR CERTAIN PLAN YEARS, REMAIN

RESTRICTED FOR AN ADDITIONAL THREE YEARS. IN OTHER PLAN YEARS

THE SHARES ARE IMMEDIATELY VESTED UPON ISSUANCE. UNVESTED SHARES

ARE SUBJECT TO FORFEITURE IF THE EXECUTIVES EMPLOYMENT

TERMINATES WITHIN THAT PERIOD. PLAN PARTICIPANTS ARE ENTITLED TO

CASH DIVIDENDS AND TO VOTE THEIR RESPECTIVE SHARES. THE VALUE OF

THE RESTRICTED SHARES IS ESTABLISHED BY THE MARKET PRICE ON THE

DATE OF ISSUANCE. UNEARNED COMPENSATION IS CHARGED FOR THE

MARKET VALUE OF THE RESTRICTED SHARES. THE UNEARNED COMPENSATION

IS SHOWN AS A REDUCTION OF SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY AND IS

BEING AMORTIZED RATABLY OVER THE SERVICE AND VESTING PERIODS.

UNDER THE LTIP A TOTAL OF 38,000 RESTRICTED SHARES WITH AN

AVERAGE PRICE OF $49.50 WERE ISSUED DURING THE YEAR ENDED

MAY 31, 2002, 115,000 RESTRICTED SHARES WITH AN

MAY 31, 2002, 2001 AND 2000, RESPECTIVELY, NET OF

FORFEITURES.

SFAS NO. 123, ACCOUNTING FOR

STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION, (FAS 123) DEFINES A FAIR

VALUE METHOD OF ACCOUNTING FOR EMPLOYEE STOCK COMPENSATION AND

ENCOURAGES, BUT DOES NOT REQUIRE, ALL ENTITIES TO ADOPT THAT

METHOD OF ACCOUNTING. ENTITIES ELECTING NOT TO ADOPT THE FAIR

VALUE METHOD OF ACCOUNTING MUST MAKE PRO FORMA DISCLOSURES OF

NET INCOME AND EARNINGS PER SHARE, AS IF THE FAIR VALUE BASED

METHOD OF ACCOUNTING DEFINED IN THIS STATEMENT HAD BEEN APPLIED.

THE COMPANY HAS ELECTED NOT TO ADOPT THE FAIR

VALUE METHOD; HOWEVER, AS REQUIRED BY FAS 123, THE COMPANY HAS

COMPUTED FOR PRO FORMA DISCLOSURE PURPOSES, THE FAIR VALUE OF

OPTIONS GRANTED DURING THE YEARS ENDED MAY 31, 2002, 2001

AND 2000 USING THE BLACK-SCHOLES OPTION PRICING MODEL. THE

WEIGHTED AVERAGE ASSUMPTIONS USED FOR STOCK OPTION GRANTS FOR

EACH OF THESE YEARS WERE A DIVIDEND YIELD OF 1%, EXPECTED

VOLATILITY OF THE MARKET PRICE OF THE COMPANYS COMMON

STOCK OF 38%, 39% AND 37% FOR THE YEARS ENDED MAY 31, 2002,

2001 AND 2000, RESPECTIVELY; A WEIGHTED-AVERAGE EXPECTED LIFE OF

THE OPTIONS OF APPROXIMATELY FIVE YEARS; AND INTEREST RATES OF

4.8% AND 5.4% FOR THE YEARS ENDED MAY 31, 2002 AND 2001,

RESPECTIVELY, AND 5.8%, 6.2% AND 6.6% FOR THE YEAR ENDED

MAY 31, 2000. THESE INTEREST RATES ARE REFLECTIVE OF OPTION

GRANT DATES THROUGHOUT THE YEAR.

OPTIONS WERE ASSUMED TO BE EXERCISED OVER THE

5 YEAR EXPECTED LIFE FOR PURPOSES OF THIS VALUATION.

ADJUSTMENTS FOR FORFEITURES ARE MADE AS THEY OCCUR. FOR THE

YEARS ENDED MAY 31, 2002, 2001 AND 2000, THE TOTAL VALUE OF

THE OPTIONS GRANTED, FOR WHICH NO PREVIOUS EXPENSE HAS BEEN

RECOGNIZED, WAS COMPUTED AS APPROXIMATELY $73.4 MILLION,

$5.0 MILLION AND $129.8 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, WHICH

WOULD BE AMORTIZED ON A STRAIGHT LINE BASIS OVER THE VESTING

PERIOD OF THE OPTIONS. THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE FAIR VALUE PER SHARE

OF THE OPTIONS GRANTED IN THE YEARS ENDED MAY 31, 2002,

2001 AND 2000 ARE $16.02, $17.27 AND $15.81, RESPECTIVELY.

SHAREHOLDERS APPROVED THE ESTABLISHMENT OF AN EMPLOYEE STOCK

PURCHASE PLAN (THE ESPP) UNDER WHICH 3,000,000

SHARES OF CLASS B STOCK ARE RESERVED FOR ISSUANCE TO

EMPLOYEES. THE PLAN QUALIFIES AS A NONCOMPENSATORY EMPLOYEE

STOCK PURCHASE PLAN UNDER SECTION 423 OF THE INTERNAL

REVENUE CODE. EMPLOYEES ARE ELIGIBLE TO PARTICIPATE THROUGH

PAYROLL DEDUCTIONS IN AMOUNTS RANGING FROM 1% TO 10% OF THEIR

COMPENSATION. AT THE END OF EACH SIX-MONTH OFFERING PERIOD,

SHARES ARE PURCHASED BY THE PARTICIPANTS AT 85% OF THE LOWER OF

THE FAIR MARKET VALUE AT THE BEGINNING OR THE END OF THE

OFFERING PERIOD. UNDER THE ESPP, 78,000 SHARES WERE ISSUED

DURING THE YEAR ENDED MAY 31, 2002.

THE COMPANY LEASES SPACE FOR CERTAIN OF ITS

$159.9 MILLION, $152.0 MILLION AND $145.5 MILLION

FOR THE YEARS ENDED MAY 31, 2002, 2001 AND 2000,

RESPECTIVELY. AMOUNTS OF MINIMUM FUTURE ANNUAL RENTAL

$158.2 MILLION, $143.4 MILLION, $119.1 MILLION,

$95.3 MILLION, $98.2 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, AND

$288.0 MILLION IN LATER YEARS.

AS OF MAY 31, 2002 AND 2001, THE COMPANY HAD

LETTERS OF CREDIT OUTSTANDING TOTALING $808.4 MILLION AND

$851.8 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. THESE LETTERS OF CREDIT WERE

ISSUED FOR THE PURCHASE OF INVENTORY.

IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF ITS BUSINESS, THE

COMPANY IS INVOLVED IN LEGAL PROCEEDINGS INVOLVING CONTRACTUAL

AND EMPLOYMENT RELATIONSHIPS, PRODUCT LIABILITY CLAIMS,

TRADEMARK RIGHTS, AND A VARIETY OF OTHER MATTERS. THE COMPANY

DOES NOT BELIEVE THERE ARE ANY PENDING LEGAL PROCEEDINGS THAT

WILL HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL

CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET FOR CASH AND EQUIVALENTS AND NOTES

FAIR VALUE OF LONG-TERM DEBT IS ESTIMATED USING DISCOUNTED CASH

FLOW ANALYSES, BASED ON THE COMPANYS INCREMENTAL BORROWING

RATES FOR SIMILAR TYPES OF BORROWING ARRANGEMENTS. THE FAIR

VALUE OF THE COMPANYS LONG-TERM DEBT, INCLUDING CURRENT

PORTION, IS APPROXIMATELY $723.9 MILLION, COMPARED TO A

CARRYING VALUE OF $681.2 MILLION AT MAY 31, 2002 AND

$437.8 MILLION, COMPARED TO A CARRYING VALUE OF

$441.3 MILLION AT MAY 31, 2001.

NOTE 15  FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT

AND DERIVATIVES

AS OF MAY 31, 2002, $50.9 MILLION OF

DEFERRED NET LOSSES (NET OF TAX) ON BOTH OUTSTANDING AND MATURED

DERIVATIVES ACCUMULATED IN OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME ARE

EXPECTED TO BE RECLASSIFIED TO EARNINGS DURING THE NEXT TWELVE

MONTHS AS A RESULT OF UNDERLYING HEDGED TRANSACTIONS ALSO BEING

RECORDED IN EARNINGS. ACTUAL AMOUNTS ULTIMATELY RECLASSIFIED TO

EARNINGS ARE DEPENDENT ON THE EXCHANGE RATES IN EFFECT WHEN

DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS THAT ARE CURRENTLY OUTSTANDING MATURE. AS

OF MAY 31, 2002, THE MAXIMUM TERM OVER WHICH THE COMPANY IS

HEDGING EXPOSURES TO THE VARIABILITY OF CASH FLOWS FOR ALL

FORECASTED AND RECORDED TRANSACTIONS IS 24 MONTHS.

FOR THE YEAR ENDED MAY 31, 2002 THE COMPANY

RECORDED IN OTHER EXPENSE AN INSIGNIFICANT LOSS REPRESENTING THE

TOTAL INEFFECTIVENESS OF ALL DERIVATIVES. NET INCOME FOR THE

YEAR ENDED MAY 31, 2002 WAS NOT MATERIALLY AFFECTED DUE TO

DISCONTINUED HEDGE ACCOUNTING.

AT MAY 31, 2002, THE FAIR VALUES OF

DERIVATIVES IN A GAIN POSITION AND RECORDED IN PREPAID EXPENSES

AND OTHER CURRENT ASSETS AND DEFERRED INCOME TAXES AND OTHER

ASSETS WERE $60.3 MILLION AND $70.0 MILLION,

RESPECTIVELY. AT THIS SAME DATE, THE FAIR VALUES OF DERIVATIVES

IN A LOSS POSITION AND RECORDED IN ACCRUED LIABILITIES AND

OF MAY 31, 2001 WAS COMPRISED OF UNREALIZED FAIR VALUE

LOSSES OF $22.9 MILLION AND UNREALIZED FAIR VALUE GAINS OF

$74.6 MILLION.

THE COMPANY IS EXPOSED TO CREDIT-RELATED LOSSES

IN THE EVENT OF NON-PERFORMANCE BY COUNTERPARTIES TO HEDGING

INSTRUMENTS. THE COUNTERPARTIES TO ALL DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS

ARE MAJOR FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS WITH INVESTMENT GRADE CREDIT

RATINGS. HOWEVER, THIS DOES NOT ELIMINATE THE COMPANYS

EXPOSURE TO CREDIT RISK WITH THESE INSTITUTIONS. THIS CREDIT

RISK IS GENERALLY LIMITED TO THE UNREALIZED GAINS IN SUCH

CONTRACTS SHOULD ANY OF THESE COUNTERPARTIES FAIL TO PERFORM AS

CONTRACTED. TO MANAGE THIS RISK, THE COMPANY HAS ESTABLISHED

STRICT COUNTERPARTY CREDIT GUIDELINES WHICH ARE CONTINUALLY

MONITORED AND REPORTED TO SENIOR MANAGEMENT ACCORDING TO

PRESCRIBED GUIDELINES. THE COMPANY UTILIZES A PORTFOLIO OF

FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS EITHER HEADQUARTERED OR OPERATING IN THE

SAME COUNTRIES THE COMPANY CONDUCTS ITS BUSINESS. AS A RESULT OF

THE ABOVE CONSIDERATIONS, THE COMPANY CONSIDERS THE RISK OF

COUNTERPARTY DEFAULT TO BE MINIMAL.

IN ADDITION TO HEDGING INSTRUMENTS, THE COMPANY

IS SUBJECT TO CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK ASSOCIATED WITH CASH

AND EQUIVALENTS AND ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE. THE COMPANY PLACES CASH

AND EQUIVALENTS WITH FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS WITH INVESTMENT

GRADE CREDIT RATINGS AND, BY POLICY, LIMITS THE AMOUNT OF CREDIT

EXPOSURE TO ANY ONE FINANCIAL INSTITUTION. THE COMPANY CONSIDERS

ITS CONCENTRATION RISK RELATED TO ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE TO BE

MITIGATED BY THE COMPANYS CREDIT POLICY, THE SIGNIFICANCE

OF OUTSTANDING BALANCES OWED BY EACH INDIVIDUAL CUSTOMER AT ANY

POINT IN TIME AND THE GEOGRAPHIC DISPERSION OF THESE CUSTOMERS.
