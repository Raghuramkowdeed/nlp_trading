GENERAL

NIKE, INC. WAS INCORPORATED IN 1968 UNDER THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF OREGON. AS USED IN THIS REPORT, THE TERMS “WE,” “US,” “NIKE,” AND THE "COMPANY” REFER TO NIKE, INC. AND ITS PREDECESSORS, SUBSIDIARIES, AND AFFILIATES, COLLECTIVELY, UNLESS THE CONTEXT INDICATES OTHERWISE. OUR NIKE E-COMMERCE WEBSITE IS LOCATED AT

WWW.NIKE.COM.

ON OUR NIKE CORPORATE WEBSITE, LOCATED AT

WE POST THE FOLLOWING FILINGS AS SOON AS REASONABLY PRACTICABLE AFTER THEY ARE ELECTRONICALLY FILED WITH OR FURNISHED TO THE UNITED STATES SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (THE "SEC"): OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K, OUR QUARTERLY REPORTS ON FORM 10-Q, OUR CURRENT REPORTS ON FORM 8-K, AND ANY AMENDMENTS TO THOSE REPORTS FILED OR FURNISHED PURSUANT TO SECTION 13(A) OR 15(D) OF THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934, AS AMENDED. OUR DEFINITIVE PROXY STATEMENTS ARE ALSO POSTED. ALL SUCH FILINGS ON OUR NIKE CORPORATE WEBSITE ARE AVAILABLE FREE OF CHARGE. COPIES OF THESE FILINGS MAY ALSO BE OBTAINED BY VISITING THE PUBLIC REFERENCE ROOM OF THE SEC AT 100 F STREET, NE, WASHINGTON, D.C. 20549 OR BY CALLING THE SEC AT 1-800-SEC-0330. IN ADDITION, THE SEC MAINTAINS A WEBSITE (

WWW.SEC.GOV

) THAT CONTAINS REPORTS, PROXY AND INFORMATION STATEMENTS, AND OTHER INFORMATION REGARDING ISSUERS THAT FILE ELECTRONICALLY.  ALSO AVAILABLE ON THE NIKE CORPORATE WEBSITE ARE THE CHARTERS OF THE COMMITTEES OF OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS, AS WELL AS OUR CORPORATE GOVERNANCE GUIDELINES AND CODE OF ETHICS; COPIES OF ANY OF THESE DOCUMENTS WILL BE PROVIDED IN PRINT TO ANY SHAREHOLDER WHO SUBMITS A REQUEST IN WRITING TO NIKE INVESTOR RELATIONS, ONE BOWERMAN DRIVE, BEAVERTON, OREGON 97005-6453.

OUR PRINCIPAL BUSINESS ACTIVITY IS THE DESIGN, DEVELOPMENT, AND WORLDWIDE MARKETING AND SELLING OF ATHLETIC FOOTWEAR, APPAREL, EQUIPMENT, ACCESSORIES, AND SERVICES. NIKE IS THE LARGEST SELLER OF ATHLETIC FOOTWEAR AND ATHLETIC APPAREL IN THE WORLD. WE SELL OUR PRODUCTS TO RETAIL ACCOUNTS, THROUGH NIKE-OWNED RETAIL STORES AND INTERNET WEBSITES (WHICH WE REFER TO AS OUR “DIRECT TO CONSUMER” OR "DTC" OPERATIONS), AND THROUGH A MIX OF INDEPENDENT DISTRIBUTORS AND LICENSEES THROUGHOUT THE WORLD. VIRTUALLY ALL OF OUR PRODUCTS ARE MANUFACTURED BY INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS. PRACTICALLY ALL FOOTWEAR AND APPAREL PRODUCTS ARE PRODUCED OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES, WHILE EQUIPMENT PRODUCTS ARE PRODUCED BOTH IN THE UNITED STATES AND ABROAD.

PRODUCTS

WE FOCUS OUR NIKE BRAND PRODUCT OFFERINGS IN EIGHT KEY CATEGORIES: RUNNING, BASKETBALL, FOOTBALL (SOCCER), MEN’S TRAINING, WOMEN’S TRAINING, ACTION SPORTS, SPORTSWEAR (OUR SPORTS-INSPIRED LIFESTYLE PRODUCTS), AND GOLF.  BASKETBALL INCLUDES OUR BRAND JORDAN PRODUCT OFFERINGS AND MEN'S TRAINING INCLUDES OUR BASEBALL AND U.S. FOOTBALL PRODUCT OFFERINGS. WE ALSO MARKET PRODUCTS DESIGNED FOR KIDS, AS WELL AS FOR OTHER ATHLETIC AND RECREATIONAL USES SUCH AS CRICKET, LACROSSE, TENNIS, VOLLEYBALL, WRESTLING, WALKING, AND OUTDOOR ACTIVITIES.

NIKE’S ATHLETIC FOOTWEAR PRODUCTS ARE DESIGNED PRIMARILY FOR SPECIFIC ATHLETIC USE, ALTHOUGH A LARGE PERCENTAGE OF THE PRODUCTS ARE WORN FOR CASUAL OR LEISURE PURPOSES. WE PLACE CONSIDERABLE EMPHASIS ON HIGH-QUALITY CONSTRUCTION AND INNOVATION IN OUR PRODUCTS. SPORTSWEAR, RUNNING, BASKETBALL, AND FOOTBALL (SOCCER) ARE CURRENTLY OUR TOP-SELLING FOOTWEAR CATEGORIES AND WE EXPECT THEM TO CONTINUE TO LEAD IN PRODUCT SALES.

WE SELL SPORTS APPAREL AND ACCESSORIES COVERING MOST OF THE ABOVE-MENTIONED CATEGORIES, WHICH FEATURE THE SAME TRADEMARKS AND ARE SOLD PREDOMINANTLY THROUGH THE SAME MARKETING AND DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS AS ATHLETIC FOOTWEAR. WE OFTEN MARKET FOOTWEAR, APPAREL, AND ACCESSORIES IN “COLLECTIONS” OF SIMILAR USE OR BY CATEGORY. WE ALSO MARKET APPAREL WITH LICENSED COLLEGE AND PROFESSIONAL TEAM AND LEAGUE LOGOS.

WE SELL A LINE OF PERFORMANCE EQUIPMENT UNDER THE NIKE BRAND NAME, INCLUDING BAGS, SOCKS, SPORT BALLS, EYEWEAR, TIMEPIECES, DIGITAL DEVICES, BATS, GLOVES, PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT, GOLF CLUBS, AND OTHER EQUIPMENT DESIGNED FOR SPORTS ACTIVITIES. WE ALSO SELL SMALL AMOUNTS OF VARIOUS PLASTIC PRODUCTS TO OTHER MANUFACTURERS THROUGH OUR WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARY, NIKE IHM, INC.

ONE OF OUR WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARY BRANDS, HURLEY, HEADQUARTERED IN COSTA MESA, CALIFORNIA (“HURLEY”), DESIGNS AND DISTRIBUTES A LINE OF ACTION SPORTS AND YOUTH LIFESTYLE APPAREL AND ACCESSORIES UNDER THE HURLEY TRADEMARK.  SALES OF HURLEY BRAND PRODUCTS ARE INCLUDED WITHIN THE NIKE BRAND ACTION SPORTS CATEGORY.

OUR BRAND JORDAN DIVISION DESIGNS, DISTRIBUTES AND LICENSES ATHLETIC AND CASUAL FOOTWEAR, APPAREL AND ACCESSORIES PREDOMINANTLY FOCUSED ON BASKETBALL USING THE JUMPMAN TRADEMARK. SALES OF BRAND JORDAN PRODUCTS ARE INCLUDED WITHIN THE NIKE BRAND BASKETBALL CATEGORY.

ANOTHER OF OUR WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARY BRANDS, CONVERSE, HEADQUARTERED IN NORTH ANDOVER, MASSACHUSETTS (“CONVERSE”), DESIGNS, DISTRIBUTES, AND LICENSES CASUAL SNEAKERS, APPAREL, AND ACCESSORIES UNDER THE CONVERSE, CHUCK TAYLOR, ALL STAR, ONE STAR, STAR CHEVRON, AND JACK PURCELL TRADEMARKS.  CONVERSE RESULTS ARE REPORTED ON A STAND-ALONE BASIS.

IN ADDITION TO THE PRODUCTS WE SELL TO OUR WHOLESALE CUSTOMERS AND DIRECTLY TO CONSUMERS THROUGH OUR DIRECT TO CONSUMER OPERATIONS, WE HAVE ALSO ENTERED INTO LICENSE AGREEMENTS THAT PERMIT UNAFFILIATED PARTIES TO MANUFACTURE AND SELL USING NIKE-OWNED TRADEMARKS, CERTAIN APPAREL, DIGITAL DEVICES AND APPLICATIONS, AND OTHER EQUIPMENT DESIGNED FOR SPORTS ACTIVITIES.

ON FEBRUARY 1, 2013, AND NOVEMBER 30, 2012, WE COMPLETED THE DIVESTITURES OF THE COLE HAAN AND UMBRO BUSINESSES, RESPECTIVELY, ALLOWING US TO BETTER FOCUS OUR RESOURCES ON DRIVING GROWTH IN THE NIKE, JORDAN, CONVERSE, AND HURLEY BRANDS.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

SALES AND MARKETING

FINANCIAL INFORMATION ABOUT GEOGRAPHIC AND SEGMENT OPERATIONS APPEARS IN NOTE 18 — OPERATING SEGMENTS AND RELATED INFORMATION OF THE ACCOMPANYING NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

WE EXPERIENCE MODERATE FLUCTUATIONS IN AGGREGATE SALES VOLUME DURING THE YEAR. HISTORICALLY, REVENUES IN THE FIRST AND FOURTH FISCAL QUARTERS HAVE SLIGHTLY EXCEEDED THOSE IN THE SECOND AND THIRD QUARTERS. HOWEVER, THE MIX OF PRODUCT SALES MAY VARY CONSIDERABLY AS A RESULT OF CHANGES IN SEASONAL AND GEOGRAPHIC DEMAND FOR PARTICULAR TYPES OF FOOTWEAR, APPAREL, AND EQUIPMENT.

BECAUSE NIKE IS A CONSUMER PRODUCTS COMPANY, THE RELATIVE POPULARITY OF VARIOUS SPORTS AND FITNESS ACTIVITIES AND CHANGING DESIGN TRENDS AFFECT THE DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS. WE MUST, THEREFORE, RESPOND TO TRENDS AND SHIFTS IN CONSUMER PREFERENCES BY ADJUSTING THE MIX OF EXISTING PRODUCT OFFERINGS, DEVELOPING NEW PRODUCTS, STYLES AND CATEGORIES, AND INFLUENCING SPORTS AND FITNESS PREFERENCES THROUGH EXTENSIVE MARKETING. FAILURE TO RESPOND IN A TIMELY AND ADEQUATE MANNER COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR SALES AND PROFITABILITY. THIS IS A CONTINUING RISK.WE REPORT OUR NIKE BRAND OPERATIONS BASED ON OUR INTERNAL GEOGRAPHIC ORGANIZATION. EACH NIKE BRAND GEOGRAPHY OPERATES PREDOMINANTLY IN ONE INDUSTRY: THE DESIGN, DEVELOPMENT, MARKETING, AND SELLING OF ATHLETIC FOOTWEAR, APPAREL, EQUIPMENT, ACCESSORIES, AND SERVICES. OUR REPORTABLE OPERATING SEGMENTS FOR THE NIKE BRAND ARE: NORTH AMERICA, WESTERN EUROPE, CENTRAL & EASTERN EUROPE, GREATER CHINA, JAPAN, AND EMERGING MARKETS. OUR NIKE BRAND DIRECT TO CONSUMER OPERATIONS ARE MANAGED WITHIN EACH GEOGRAPHIC SEGMENT.

CONVERSE IS ALSO A REPORTABLE SEGMENT, AND OPERATES IN ONE INDUSTRY: THE DESIGN, MARKETING, LICENSING, AND SELLING OF CASUAL SNEAKERS, APPAREL, AND ACCESSORIES.

UNITED STATES MARKET

IN FISCAL 2014, NIKE BRAND AND CONVERSE SALES IN THE UNITED STATES ACCOUNTED FOR APPROXIMATELY 46% OF TOTAL REVENUES, COMPARED TO 45% IN FISCAL 2013 AND 42% IN FISCAL 2012. WE SELL TO THOUSANDS OF RETAIL ACCOUNTS IN THE UNITED STATES, INCLUDING A MIX OF FOOTWEAR STORES, SPORTING GOODS STORES, ATHLETIC SPECIALTY STORES, DEPARTMENT STORES, SKATE, TENNIS, AND GOLF SHOPS, AND OTHER RETAIL ACCOUNTS. DURING FISCAL 2014, OUR THREE LARGEST CUSTOMERS ACCOUNTED FOR APPROXIMATELY 26% OF SALES IN THE UNITED STATES.

WE MAKE SUBSTANTIAL USE OF OUR FUTURES ORDERING PROGRAM, WHICH ALLOWS RETAILERS TO ORDER FIVE TO SIX MONTHS IN ADVANCE OF DELIVERY WITH THE COMMITMENT THAT THEIR ORDERS WILL BE DELIVERED WITHIN A SET TIME PERIOD AT A FIXED PRICE. IN FISCAL 2014, 86% OF OUR U.S. WHOLESALE FOOTWEAR SHIPMENTS (EXCLUDING NIKE GOLF, HURLEY, AND CONVERSE) WERE MADE UNDER THE FUTURES PROGRAM, COMPARED TO 87% IN FISCAL 2013 AND 86% IN FISCAL 2012. IN FISCAL 2014, 71% OF OUR U.S. WHOLESALE APPAREL SHIPMENTS (EXCLUDING NIKE GOLF, HURLEY, AND CONVERSE) WERE MADE UNDER THE FUTURES PROGRAM, COMPARED TO 67% IN FISCAL 2013 AND 64% IN FISCAL 2012.

WE UTILIZE NIKE SALES OFFICES TO SOLICIT SALES IN THE UNITED STATES, AS WELL AS INDEPENDENT SALES REPRESENTATIVES TO SELL SPECIALTY PRODUCTS FOR GOLF, SKATEBOARDING, AND SNOWBOARDING. IN ADDITION, OUR DIRECT TO CONSUMER OPERATIONS SELL NIKE BRAND PRODUCTS TO CONSUMERS THROUGH OUR E-COMMERCE WEBSITE,

INTERNATIONAL MARKETS

IN FISCAL 2014, NON-U.S. NIKE BRAND AND CONVERSE SALES ACCOUNTED FOR 54% OF TOTAL REVENUES, COMPARED TO 55% IN FISCAL 2013 AND 58% IN FISCAL 2012. WE SELL OUR PRODUCTS TO RETAIL ACCOUNTS, THROUGH OUR OWN DIRECT TO CONSUMER OPERATIONS, AND THROUGH A MIX OF INDEPENDENT DISTRIBUTORS, LICENSEES, AND SALES REPRESENTATIVES AROUND THE WORLD. WE SELL TO THOUSANDS OF RETAIL ACCOUNTS AND OPERATE 16 DISTRIBUTION CENTERS OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES. IN MANY COUNTRIES AND REGIONS, INCLUDING CANADA, ASIA, SOME LATIN AMERICAN COUNTRIES, AND EUROPE, WE HAVE A FUTURES ORDERING PROGRAM FOR RETAILERS SIMILAR TO THE UNITED STATES FUTURES ORDERING PROGRAM DESCRIBED ABOVE. DURING FISCAL 2014, NIKE’S THREE LARGEST CUSTOMERS OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES ACCOUNTED FOR APPROXIMATELY 6% OF TOTAL NON-U.S. SALES.

ORDERS

WORLDWIDE FUTURES ORDERS FOR NIKE BRAND (EXCLUDING NIKE GOLF AND HURLEY) ATHLETIC FOOTWEAR AND APPAREL, SCHEDULED FOR DELIVERY FROM JUNE THROUGH NOVEMBER 2014, WERE $13.3 BILLION COMPARED TO $12.1 BILLION FOR THE SAME PERIOD LAST YEAR. THIS FUTURES ORDERS AMOUNT IS CALCULATED BASED UPON OUR FORECAST OF THE ACTUAL EXCHANGE RATES UNDER WHICH OUR REVENUES WILL BE TRANSLATED DURING THIS PERIOD. REPORTED FUTURES ORDERS ARE NOT NECESSARILY INDICATIVE OF OUR EXPECTATION OF REVENUES FOR THIS PERIOD. THIS IS BECAUSE THE MIX OF ORDERS CAN SHIFT BETWEEN FUTURES AND AT-ONCE ORDERS AND THE FULFILLMENT OF CERTAIN OF THESE FUTURES ORDERS MAY FALL OUTSIDE OF THE SCHEDULED TIME PERIOD NOTED ABOVE. IN ADDITION, FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE FLUCTUATIONS AS WELL AS DIFFERING LEVELS OF DISCOUNTS, ORDER CANCELLATIONS, AND RETURNS CAN CAUSE DIFFERENCES IN THE COMPARISONS BETWEEN FUTURES ORDERS AND ACTUAL REVENUES. MOREOVER, A PORTION OF OUR REVENUE IS NOT DERIVED FROM FUTURES ORDERS, INCLUDING AT-ONCE AND CLOSEOUT SALES OF NIKE BRAND FOOTWEAR AND APPAREL, SALES OF NIKE BRAND EQUIPMENT, SALES FROM OUR DIRECT TO CONSUMER OPERATIONS, AND SALES FROM OUR CONVERSE, HURLEY, AND NIKE GOLF BUSINESSES.

PRODUCT RESEARCH, DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT

WE BELIEVE OUR RESEARCH, DESIGN, AND DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS ARE KEY FACTORS IN OUR SUCCESS. TECHNICAL INNOVATION IN THE DESIGN AND MANUFACTURING PROCESS OF FOOTWEAR, APPAREL, AND ATHLETIC EQUIPMENT RECEIVE CONTINUED EMPHASIS AS NIKE STRIVES TO PRODUCE PRODUCTS THAT HELP TO ENHANCE ATHLETIC PERFORMANCE, REDUCE INJURY, AND MAXIMIZE COMFORT.

IN ADDITION TO NIKE’S OWN STAFF OF SPECIALISTS IN THE AREAS OF BIOMECHANICS, CHEMISTRY, EXERCISE PHYSIOLOGY, ENGINEERING, INDUSTRIAL DESIGN, SUSTAINABILITY, AND RELATED FIELDS, WE ALSO UTILIZE RESEARCH COMMITTEES AND ADVISORY BOARDS MADE UP OF ATHLETES, COACHES, TRAINERS, EQUIPMENT MANAGERS, ORTHOPEDISTS, PODIATRISTS, AND OTHER EXPERTS WHO CONSULT WITH US AND REVIEW DESIGNS, MATERIALS, CONCEPTS FOR PRODUCT AND MANUFACTURING PROCESS IMPROVEMENTS, AND COMPLIANCE WITH PRODUCT SAFETY REGULATIONS AROUND THE WORLD. EMPLOYEE ATHLETES, ATHLETES ENGAGED UNDER SPORTS MARKETING CONTRACTS, AND OTHER ATHLETES WEAR-TEST AND EVALUATE PRODUCTS DURING THE DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT PROCESS.

AS WE CONTINUE TO DEVELOP NEW TECHNOLOGIES, NIKE IS SIMULTANEOUSLY FOCUSED ON THE DESIGN OF INNOVATIVE PRODUCTS INCORPORATING SUCH TECHNOLOGIES THROUGHOUT OUR PRODUCT CATEGORIES. USING MARKET INTELLIGENCE AND RESEARCH, THE VARIOUS NIKE DESIGN TEAMS IDENTIFY OPPORTUNITIES TO LEVERAGE NEW TECHNOLOGIES IN EXISTING CATEGORIES RESPONDING TO CONSUMER PREFERENCES. THE PROLIFERATION OF NIKE AIR, LUNAR, SHOX, FREE, FLYWIRE, DRI-FIT, FLYKNIT, NIKE+, AND NIKE FUEL TECHNOLOGIES THROUGH RUNNING, BASKETBALL, MEN'S TRAINING, WOMEN'S TRAINING, AND SPORTSWEAR, AMONG OTHERS, TYPIFIES THE COMPANY'S DEDICATION TO DESIGNING INNOVATIVE PRODUCTS.

MANUFACTURING

WE ARE SUPPLIED BY APPROXIMATELY 150 FOOTWEAR FACTORIES LOCATED IN 14 COUNTRIES. THE LARGEST SINGLE FOOTWEAR FACTORY ACCOUNTED FOR APPROXIMATELY 5% OF TOTAL FISCAL 2014 NIKE BRAND FOOTWEAR PRODUCTION. VIRTUALLY ALL OF OUR FOOTWEAR IS MANUFACTURED OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES BY INDEPENDENT CONTRACT MANUFACTURERS WHO OFTEN OPERATE MULTIPLE FACTORIES. IN FISCAL 2014, CONTRACT FACTORIES IN VIETNAM, CHINA, AND INDONESIA MANUFACTURED APPROXIMATELY 43%, 28%, AND 25% OF TOTAL NIKE BRAND FOOTWEAR, RESPECTIVELY. WE ALSO HAVE MANUFACTURING AGREEMENTS WITH INDEPENDENT FACTORIES IN ARGENTINA, BRAZIL, INDIA, AND MEXICO TO MANUFACTURE FOOTWEAR FOR SALE PRIMARILY WITHIN THOSE COUNTRIES. IN FISCAL 2014, FIVE FOOTWEAR CONTRACT MANUFACTURERS EACH ACCOUNTED FOR GREATER THAN 10% OF FISCAL 2014 FOOTWEAR PRODUCTION, AND IN AGGREGATE ACCOUNTED FOR APPROXIMATELY 67% OF NIKE BRAND FOOTWEAR PRODUCTION IN FISCAL 2014.

WE ARE SUPPLIED BY APPROXIMATELY 430 APPAREL FACTORIES LOCATED IN 41 COUNTRIES. THE LARGEST SINGLE APPAREL FACTORY ACCOUNTED FOR APPROXIMATELY 7% OF TOTAL FISCAL 2014 NIKE BRAND APPAREL PRODUCTION. VIRTUALLY ALL OF OUR APPAREL IS MANUFACTURED OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES BY INDEPENDENT CONTRACT MANUFACTURERS WHO OFTEN OPERATE MULTIPLE FACTORIES. IN FISCAL 2014, MOST OF THIS APPAREL PRODUCTION OCCURRED IN CHINA, VIETNAM, THAILAND, INDONESIA, SRI LANKA, PAKISTAN, AND MALAYSIA. IN FISCAL 2014, ONE APPAREL CONTRACT MANUFACTURER ACCOUNTED FOR GREATER THAN 10% OF FISCAL 2014 APPAREL PRODUCTION, AND THE TOP FIVE CONTRACT MANUFACTURERS IN AGGREGATE ACCOUNTED FOR APPROXIMATELY 34% OF NIKE BRAND APPAREL PRODUCTION IN FISCAL 2014.

THE PRINCIPAL MATERIALS USED IN OUR FOOTWEAR PRODUCTS ARE NATURAL AND SYNTHETIC RUBBER, PLASTIC COMPOUNDS, FOAM CUSHIONING MATERIALS, NYLON, LEATHER, CANVAS, AND POLYURETHANE FILMS USED TO MAKE NIKE AIR-SOLE CUSHIONING COMPONENTS. DURING FISCAL 2014, NIKE IHM, INC., A WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARY OF NIKE, INC., WITH FACILITIES NEAR BEAVERTON, OREGON AND IN ST. LOUIS, MISSOURI, AS WELL AS INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS IN CHINA AND VIETNAM, WERE OUR LARGEST SUPPLIERS OF THE AIR-SOLE CUSHIONING COMPONENTS USED IN FOOTWEAR. THE PRINCIPAL MATERIALS USED IN OUR APPAREL PRODUCTS ARE NATURAL AND SYNTHETIC FABRICS AND THREADS (BOTH VIRGIN AND RECYCLED), SPECIALIZED PERFORMANCE FABRICS DESIGNED TO EFFICIENTLY WICK MOISTURE AWAY FROM THE BODY, RETAIN HEAT, REPEL RAIN AND/OR SNOW, AS WELL AS PLASTIC AND METAL HARDWARE. NIKE’S INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS AND SUPPLIERS BUY RAW MATERIALS IN BULK FOR THE MANUFACTURING OF OUR FOOTWEAR, APPAREL, AND EQUIPMENT PRODUCTS. MOST RAW MATERIALS ARE AVAILABLE AND PURCHASED BY THOSE INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS AND SUPPLIERS IN THE COUNTRIES WHERE MANUFACTURING TAKES PLACE. NIKE'S INDEPENDENT CONTRACT MANUFACTURERS AND SUPPLIERS HAVE THUS FAR EXPERIENCED LITTLE DIFFICULTY IN SATISFYING RAW MATERIAL REQUIREMENTS FOR THE PRODUCTION OF OUR PRODUCTS.

SINCE 1972, SOJITZ CORPORATION OF AMERICA (“SOJITZ AMERICA”), A LARGE JAPANESE TRADING COMPANY AND THE SOLE OWNER OF OUR REDEEMABLE PREFERRED STOCK, HAS PERFORMED SIGNIFICANT IMPORT-EXPORT FINANCING SERVICES FOR US. DURING FISCAL 2014, SOJITZ AMERICA PROVIDED FINANCING AND PURCHASING SERVICES FOR NIKE BRAND PRODUCTS SOLD IN CERTAIN NIKE MARKETS INCLUDING ARGENTINA, URUGUAY, CANADA, BRAZIL, INDIA, INDONESIA, THE PHILIPPINES, MALAYSIA, SOUTH AFRICA, AND THAILAND, EXCLUDING PRODUCTS PRODUCED AND SOLD IN THE SAME COUNTRY. APPROXIMATELY 8% OF NIKE BRAND SALES OCCURRED IN THOSE COUNTRIES. ANY FAILURE OF SOJITZ AMERICA TO PROVIDE THESE SERVICES OR ANY FAILURE OF SOJITZ AMERICA’S BANKS COULD DISRUPT OUR ABILITY TO ACQUIRE PRODUCTS FROM OUR SUPPLIERS AND TO DELIVER PRODUCTS TO OUR CUSTOMERS IN THOSE MARKETS. SUCH A DISRUPTION COULD RESULT IN CANCELED ORDERS THAT WOULD ADVERSELY AFFECT SALES AND PROFITABILITY. HOWEVER, WE BELIEVE THAT ANY SUCH DISRUPTION WOULD BE SHORT-TERM IN DURATION DUE TO THE READY AVAILABILITY OF ALTERNATIVE SOURCES OF FINANCING AT COMPETITIVE RATES. OUR CURRENT AGREEMENTS WITH SOJITZ AMERICA EXPIRE ON MAY 31, 2015.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS AND TRADE

OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS AND SOURCES OF SUPPLY ARE SUBJECT TO THE USUAL RISKS OF DOING BUSINESS ABROAD, SUCH AS POSSIBLE REVALUATION OF CURRENCIES, EXPORT AND IMPORT DUTIES, ANTI-DUMPING MEASURES, QUOTAS, SAFEGUARD MEASURES, TRADE RESTRICTIONS, RESTRICTIONS ON THE TRANSFER OF FUNDS, AND, IN CERTAIN PARTS OF THE WORLD, POLITICAL INSTABILITY AND TERRORISM. WE HAVE NOT, TO DATE, BEEN MATERIALLY AFFECTED BY ANY SUCH RISK, BUT CANNOT PREDICT THE LIKELIHOOD OF SUCH MATERIAL EFFECTS OCCURRING IN THE FUTURE.

IN RECENT YEARS, UNCERTAIN GLOBAL AND REGIONAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS HAVE AFFECTED INTERNATIONAL TRADE AND CAUSED A RISE IN PROTECTIONIST ACTIONS AROUND THE WORLD.

THESE TRENDS ARE AFFECTING MANY GLOBAL MANUFACTURING AND SERVICE SECTORS, AND THE FOOTWEAR AND APPAREL INDUSTRIES, AS A WHOLE, ARE NOT IMMUNE. COMPANIES IN OUR INDUSTRY ARE FACING TRADE PROTECTIONISM IN MANY DIFFERENT REGIONS, AND IN NEARLY ALL CASES WE ARE WORKING TOGETHER WITH INDUSTRY GROUPS TO ADDRESS TRADE ISSUES AND REDUCE THE IMPACT TO THE INDUSTRY, WHILE OBSERVING APPLICABLE COMPETITION LAWS. NOTWITHSTANDING OUR EFFORTS, SUCH PROTECTIONIST MEASURES, IF IMPLEMENTED, COULD RESULT IN INCREASES IN THE COST OF OUR PRODUCTS, WHICH MAY IN TURN ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR SALES OR PROFITABILITY AS WELL AS THE IMPORTED FOOTWEAR AND APPAREL INDUSTRY AS A WHOLE.

WE MONITOR PROTECTIONIST TRENDS AND DEVELOPMENTS THROUGHOUT THE WORLD THAT MAY MATERIALLY IMPACT OUR INDUSTRY, AND WE ENGAGE IN ADMINISTRATIVE AND JUDICIAL PROCESSES TO MITIGATE TRADE RESTRICTIONS. IN BRAZIL, WE ARE ACTIVELY MONITORING FOR DUMPING INVESTIGATIONS AGAINST PRODUCTS FROM CHINA AND OTHER COUNTRIES THAT MAY RESULT IN ADDITIONAL ANTI-DUMPING MEASURES AND COULD AFFECT OUR INDUSTRY. WE ARE ALSO MONITORING FOR AND ADVOCATING AGAINST OTHER IMPEDIMENTS THAT MAY INCREASE CUSTOMS CLEARANCE TIMES FOR IMPORTS OF FOOTWEAR, APPAREL, AND EQUIPMENT. MOREOVER, WITH RESPECT TO TRADE RESTRICTIONS TARGETING CHINA, WHICH REPRESENTS AN IMPORTANT SOURCING AND CONSUMER MARKETING COUNTRY FOR US, WE ARE WORKING WITH A BROAD COALITION OF GLOBAL BUSINESSES AND TRADE ASSOCIATIONS REPRESENTING A WIDE VARIETY OF SECTORS TO HELP ENSURE THAT ANY LEGISLATION ENACTED AND IMPLEMENTED (I)

ADDRESSES LEGITIMATE AND CORE CONCERNS, (II)

IS CONSISTENT WITH INTERNATIONAL TRADE RULES, AND (III)

REFLECTS AND CONSIDERS CHINA'S DOMESTIC ECONOMY AND THE IMPORTANT ROLE IT HAS IN THE GLOBAL ECONOMIC COMMUNITY.

WHERE TRADE PROTECTION MEASURES ARE IMPLEMENTED, WE BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO DEVELOP, OVER A PERIOD OF TIME, ADEQUATE ALTERNATIVE SOURCES OF SUPPLY FOR THE PRODUCTS OBTAINED FROM OUR PRESENT SUPPLIERS. IF EVENTS PREVENTED US FROM ACQUIRING PRODUCTS FROM OUR SUPPLIERS IN A PARTICULAR COUNTRY, OUR OPERATIONS COULD BE TEMPORARILY DISRUPTED AND WE COULD EXPERIENCE AN ADVERSE FINANCIAL IMPACT. HOWEVER, WE BELIEVE WE COULD ABATE ANY SUCH DISRUPTION, AND THAT MUCH OF THE ADVERSE IMPACT ON SUPPLY WOULD, THEREFORE, BE OF A SHORT-TERM NATURE, ALTHOUGH ALTERNATE SOURCES OF SUPPLY MIGHT NOT BE AS COST-EFFECTIVE AND COULD HAVE AN ONGOING ADVERSE IMPACT ON PROFITABILITY.

COMPETITION

THE ATHLETIC FOOTWEAR, APPAREL, AND EQUIPMENT INDUSTRY IS HIGHLY COMPETITIVE ON A WORLDWIDE BASIS. WE COMPETE INTERNATIONALLY WITH A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF ATHLETIC AND LEISURE FOOTWEAR COMPANIES, ATHLETIC AND LEISURE APPAREL COMPANIES, SPORTS EQUIPMENT COMPANIES, AND LARGE COMPANIES HAVING DIVERSIFIED LINES OF ATHLETIC AND LEISURE FOOTWEAR, APPAREL, AND EQUIPMENT, INCLUDING ADIDAS, V.F. CORP., PUMA, LI NING, AND UNDER ARMOUR, AMONG OTHERS. WE ALSO COMPETE WITH A NUMBER OF VERTICAL RETAILERS SUCH AS LULULEMON ATHLETICA AND UNIQLO. THE INTENSE COMPETITION AND THE RAPID CHANGES IN TECHNOLOGY AND CONSUMER PREFERENCES IN THE MARKETS FOR ATHLETIC AND LEISURE FOOTWEAR AND APPAREL, AND ATHLETIC EQUIPMENT, CONSTITUTE SIGNIFICANT RISK FACTORS IN OUR OPERATIONS.

NIKE IS THE LARGEST SELLER OF ATHLETIC FOOTWEAR, APPAREL, AND EQUIPMENT IN THE WORLD. IMPORTANT ASPECTS OF COMPETITION IN THIS INDUSTRY ARE.

•

PRODUCT QUALITY; PERFORMANCE AND RELIABILITY; NEW PRODUCT INNOVATION AND DEVELOPMENT; AND CONSUMER PRICE/VALUE;

•

CONSUMER CONNECTION AND AFFINITY FOR BRANDS AND PRODUCTS, DEVELOPED THROUGH MARKETING AND PROMOTION; CUSTOMER SUPPORT AND SERVICE; IDENTIFICATION WITH PROMINENT AND INFLUENTIAL ATHLETES, COACHES, TEAMS, COLLEGES, AND SPORTS LEAGUES WHO ENDORSE OUR BRANDS AND USE OUR PRODUCTS; AND ACTIVE ENGAGEMENT THROUGH SPONSORED SPORTING EVENTS AND CLINICS; AND

•

EFFECTIVE DISTRIBUTION OF PRODUCTS, WITH ATTRACTIVE MERCHANDISING AND PRESENTATION AT RETAIL, BOTH IN STORE AND ONLINE.

WE BELIEVE THAT WE ARE COMPETITIVE IN ALL OF THESE AREAS.

TRADEMARKS AND PATENTS

WE UTILIZE TRADEMARKS ON NEARLY ALL OF OUR PRODUCTS AND BELIEVE HAVING DISTINCTIVE MARKS THAT ARE READILY IDENTIFIABLE IS AN IMPORTANT FACTOR IN CREATING A MARKET FOR OUR GOODS, IN IDENTIFYING OUR BRANDS AND THE COMPANY, AND IN DISTINGUISHING OUR GOODS FROM THE GOODS OF OTHERS. WE CONSIDER OUR NIKE AND SWOOSH DESIGN TRADEMARKS TO BE AMONG OUR MOST VALUABLE ASSETS AND WE HAVE REGISTERED THESE TRADEMARKS IN ALMOST 170 JURISDICTIONS. IN ADDITION, WE OWN MANY OTHER TRADEMARKS THAT WE UTILIZE IN MARKETING OUR PRODUCTS. WE OWN COMMON LAW RIGHTS IN THE TRADE DRESS OF SEVERAL SIGNIFICANT SHOE DESIGNS AND ELEMENTS. FOR CERTAIN TRADE DRESS, WE HAVE SOUGHT AND OBTAINED FEDERAL TRADEMARK REGISTRATIONS.

NIKE HAS COPYRIGHT PROTECTION IN ITS DESIGN, GRAPHICS AND OTHER ORIGINAL WORKS. WHEN APPROPRIATE, WE HAVE SOUGHT REGISTRATIONS FOR THIS CONTENT.

NIKE OWNS PATENTS, AND HAS A PATENT LICENSE, FACILITATING ITS USE OF “AIR” TECHNOLOGIES. THE "AIR" PROCESS UTILIZES PRESSURIZED GAS ENCAPSULATED IN POLYURETHANE. SOME OF THE EARLY NIKE AIR PATENTS HAVE EXPIRED, WHICH MAY ENABLE COMPETITORS TO USE CERTAIN TYPES OF SIMILAR TECHNOLOGY. SUBSEQUENT NIKE AIR PATENTS WILL NOT EXPIRE FOR SEVERAL YEARS.

WE ALSO FILE AND MAINTAIN MANY U.S. AND FOREIGN UTILITY PATENTS, AS WELL AS MANY U.S. AND FOREIGN DESIGN PATENTS PROTECTING COMPONENTS, MANUFACTURING TECHNIQUES, FEATURES, AND INDUSTRIAL DESIGN USED IN VARIOUS ATHLETIC AND LEISURE FOOTWEAR, APPAREL, ATHLETIC EQUIPMENT, DIGITAL DEVICES, AND GOLF PRODUCTS. THESE PATENTS EXPIRE AT VARIOUS TIMES; AND PATENTS ISSUED FOR APPLICATIONS FILED THIS CALENDAR YEAR IN THE UNITED STATES WILL LAST UNTIL 2028 FOR DESIGN PATENTS AND UNTIL 2034 FOR UTILITY PATENTS.

WE BELIEVE OUR SUCCESS DEPENDS PRIMARILY UPON OUR CAPABILITIES IN DESIGN, RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, PRODUCTION, AND MARKETING RATHER THAN EXCLUSIVELY UPON OUR PATENT POSITION. HOWEVER, WE HAVE FOLLOWED A POLICY OF FILING PATENT APPLICATIONS FOR THE UNITED STATES AND SELECT FOREIGN COUNTRIES ON INVENTIONS, DESIGNS, AND IMPROVEMENTS THAT WE DEEM VALUABLE.  WE CONTINUE TO VIGOROUSLY PROTECT OUR TRADEMARKS AND PATENTS AGAINST INFRINGEMENT.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS

SPECIAL NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS AND ANALYST REPORTS

CERTAIN WRITTEN AND ORAL STATEMENTS, OTHER THAN PURELY HISTORIC INFORMATION, INCLUDING ESTIMATES, PROJECTIONS, STATEMENTS RELATING TO NIKE’S BUSINESS PLANS, OBJECTIVES, AND EXPECTED OPERATING RESULTS, AND THE ASSUMPTIONS UPON WHICH THOSE STATEMENTS ARE BASED, MADE OR INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE FROM TIME TO TIME BY NIKE OR ITS REPRESENTATIVES IN THIS REPORT, OTHER REPORTS, FILINGS WITH THE SEC, PRESS RELEASES, CONFERENCES, OR OTHERWISE, ARE “FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS” WITHIN THE MEANING OF THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995 AND SECTION 21E OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934, AS AMENDED. FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS INCLUDE, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY STATEMENT THAT MAY PREDICT, FORECAST, INDICATE, OR IMPLY FUTURE RESULTS, PERFORMANCE, OR ACHIEVEMENTS, AND MAY CONTAIN THE WORDS “BELIEVE,” “ANTICIPATE,” “EXPECT,” “ESTIMATE,” “PROJECT,” “WILL BE,” “WILL CONTINUE,” “WILL LIKELY RESULT,” OR WORDS OR PHRASES OF SIMILAR MEANING. FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS INVOLVE RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES WHICH MAY CAUSE ACTUAL RESULTS TO DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS. THE RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES ARE DETAILED FROM TIME TO TIME IN REPORTS FILED BY NIKE WITH THE SEC, INCLUDING FORMS 8-K, 10-Q, AND 10-K, AND INCLUDE, AMONG OTHERS, THE FOLLOWING: INTERNATIONAL, NATIONAL, AND LOCAL GENERAL ECONOMIC AND MARKET CONDITIONS; THE SIZE AND GROWTH OF THE OVERALL ATHLETIC FOOTWEAR, APPAREL, AND EQUIPMENT MARKETS; INTENSE COMPETITION AMONG DESIGNERS, MARKETERS, DISTRIBUTORS, AND SELLERS OF ATHLETIC FOOTWEAR, APPAREL, AND EQUIPMENT FOR CONSUMERS AND ENDORSERS; DEMOGRAPHIC CHANGES; CHANGES IN CONSUMER PREFERENCES; POPULARITY OF PARTICULAR DESIGNS, CATEGORIES OF PRODUCTS, AND SPORTS; SEASONAL AND GEOGRAPHIC DEMAND FOR NIKE PRODUCTS; DIFFICULTIES IN ANTICIPATING OR FORECASTING CHANGES IN CONSUMER PREFERENCES, CONSUMER DEMAND FOR NIKE PRODUCTS, AND THE VARIOUS MARKET FACTORS DESCRIBED ABOVE; DIFFICULTIES IN IMPLEMENTING, OPERATING, AND MAINTAINING NIKE’S INCREASINGLY COMPLEX INFORMATION SYSTEMS AND CONTROLS, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE SYSTEMS RELATED TO DEMAND AND SUPPLY PLANNING AND INVENTORY CONTROL; INTERRUPTIONS IN DATA AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS; CONSUMER DATA SECURITY; FLUCTUATIONS AND DIFFICULTY IN FORECASTING OPERATING RESULTS, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE FACT THAT ADVANCE FUTURES ORDERS MAY NOT BE INDICATIVE OF FUTURE REVENUES DUE TO CHANGES IN SHIPMENT TIMING, THE CHANGING MIX OF FUTURES AND AT-ONCE ORDERS, AND DISCOUNTS, ORDER CANCELLATIONS, AND RETURNS; THE ABILITY OF NIKE TO SUSTAIN, MANAGE, OR FORECAST ITS GROWTH AND INVENTORIES; THE SIZE, TIMING, AND MIX OF PURCHASES OF NIKE’S PRODUCTS; INCREASES IN THE COST OF MATERIALS, LABOR, AND ENERGY USED TO MANUFACTURE PRODUCTS, NEW PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT, AND INTRODUCTION; THE ABILITY TO SECURE AND PROTECT TRADEMARKS, PATENTS, AND OTHER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY; PRODUCT PERFORMANCE AND QUALITY; CUSTOMER SERVICE; ADVERSE PUBLICITY; THE LOSS OF SIGNIFICANT CUSTOMERS OR SUPPLIERS; DEPENDENCE ON DISTRIBUTORS AND LICENSEES; BUSINESS DISRUPTIONS; INCREASED COSTS OF FREIGHT AND TRANSPORTATION TO MEET DELIVERY DEADLINES; INCREASES IN BORROWING COSTS DUE TO ANY DECLINE IN NIKE'S DEBT RATINGS; CHANGES IN BUSINESS STRATEGY OR DEVELOPMENT PLANS; GENERAL RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH DOING BUSINESS OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, EXCHANGE RATE FLUCTUATIONS, IMPORT DUTIES, TARIFFS, QUOTAS, POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC INSTABILITY, AND TERRORISM; CHANGES IN GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS; THE IMPACT OF, INCLUDING BUSINESS AND LEGAL DEVELOPMENTS RELATING TO, CLIMATE CHANGE; NATURAL DISASTERS; LIABILITY AND OTHER CLAIMS ASSERTED AGAINST NIKE; THE ABILITY TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN QUALIFIED PERSONNEL; THE EFFECTS OF NIKE'S DECISION TO INVEST IN OR DIVEST OF BUSINESSES; AND OTHER FACTORS REFERENCED OR INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE IN THIS REPORT AND OTHER REPORTS.

THE RISKS INCLUDED HERE ARE NOT EXHAUSTIVE. OTHER SECTIONS OF THIS REPORT MAY INCLUDE ADDITIONAL FACTORS WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT NIKE’S BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE. MOREOVER, NIKE OPERATES IN A VERY COMPETITIVE AND RAPIDLY CHANGING ENVIRONMENT. NEW RISK FACTORS EMERGE FROM TIME TO TIME AND IT IS NOT POSSIBLE FOR MANAGEMENT TO PREDICT ALL SUCH RISK FACTORS, NOR CAN IT ASSESS THE IMPACT OF ALL SUCH RISK FACTORS ON NIKE’S BUSINESS OR THE EXTENT TO WHICH ANY FACTOR, OR COMBINATION OF FACTORS, MAY CAUSE ACTUAL RESULTS TO DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THOSE CONTAINED IN ANY FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS. GIVEN THESE RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES, INVESTORS SHOULD NOT PLACE UNDUE RELIANCE ON FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS AS A PREDICTION OF ACTUAL RESULTS.

INVESTORS SHOULD ALSO BE AWARE THAT WHILE NIKE DOES, FROM TIME TO TIME, COMMUNICATE WITH SECURITIES ANALYSTS, IT IS AGAINST NIKE’S POLICY TO DISCLOSE TO THEM ANY MATERIAL NON-PUBLIC INFORMATION OR OTHER CONFIDENTIAL COMMERCIAL INFORMATION. ACCORDINGLY, SHAREHOLDERS SHOULD NOT ASSUME THAT NIKE AGREES WITH ANY STATEMENT OR REPORT ISSUED BY ANY ANALYST IRRESPECTIVE OF THE CONTENT OF THE STATEMENT OR REPORT. FURTHERMORE, NIKE HAS A POLICY AGAINST ISSUING OR CONFIRMING FINANCIAL FORECASTS OR PROJECTIONS ISSUED BY OTHERS. THUS, TO THE EXTENT THAT REPORTS ISSUED BY SECURITIES ANALYSTS CONTAIN ANY PROJECTIONS, FORECASTS, OR OPINIONS, SUCH REPORTS ARE NOT THE RESPONSIBILITY OF NIKE.

OUR PRODUCTS FACE INTENSE COMPETITION.

NIKE IS A CONSUMER PRODUCTS COMPANY AND THE RELATIVE POPULARITY OF VARIOUS SPORTS AND FITNESS ACTIVITIES AND CHANGING DESIGN TRENDS AFFECT THE DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS. THE ATHLETIC FOOTWEAR, APPAREL, AND EQUIPMENT INDUSTRY IS HIGHLY COMPETITIVE IN THE UNITED STATES AND ON A WORLDWIDE BASIS. WE COMPETE INTERNATIONALLY WITH A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF ATHLETIC AND LEISURE FOOTWEAR COMPANIES, ATHLETIC AND LEISURE APPAREL COMPANIES, SPORTS EQUIPMENT COMPANIES, AND LARGE COMPANIES HAVING DIVERSIFIED LINES OF ATHLETIC AND LEISURE FOOTWEAR, APPAREL, AND EQUIPMENT. WE ALSO COMPETE WITH OTHER COMPANIES FOR THE PRODUCTION CAPACITY OF INDEPENDENT MANUFACTURERS THAT PRODUCE OUR PRODUCTS.

PRODUCT OFFERINGS, TECHNOLOGIES, MARKETING EXPENDITURES (INCLUDING EXPENDITURES FOR ADVERTISING AND ENDORSEMENTS), PRICING, COSTS OF PRODUCTION, AND CUSTOMER SERVICE ARE AREAS OF INTENSE COMPETITION. THIS, IN ADDITION TO RAPID CHANGES IN TECHNOLOGY AND CONSUMER PREFERENCES IN THE MARKETS FOR ATHLETIC AND LEISURE FOOTWEAR AND APPAREL, AND ATHLETIC EQUIPMENT, CONSTITUTE SIGNIFICANT RISK FACTORS IN OUR OPERATIONS. IF WE DO NOT ADEQUATELY AND TIMELY ANTICIPATE AND RESPOND TO OUR COMPETITORS, OUR COSTS MAY INCREASE OR THE CONSUMER DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS MAY DECLINE SIGNIFICANTLY.

FAILURE TO MAINTAIN OUR REPUTATION AND BRAND IMAGE COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR BUSINESS.

OUR ICONIC BRANDS HAVE WORLDWIDE RECOGNITION, AND OUR SUCCESS DEPENDS ON OUR ABILITY TO MAINTAIN AND ENHANCE OUR BRAND IMAGE AND REPUTATION. MAINTAINING, PROMOTING, AND GROWING OUR BRANDS WILL DEPEND ON OUR DESIGN AND MARKETING EFFORTS, INCLUDING ADVERTISING AND CONSUMER CAMPAIGNS, PRODUCT INNOVATION, AND PRODUCT QUALITY. OUR COMMITMENT TO PRODUCT INNOVATION AND QUALITY AND OUR CONTINUING INVESTMENT IN DESIGN (INCLUDING MATERIALS) AND MARKETING MAY NOT HAVE THE DESIRED IMPACT ON OUR BRAND IMAGE AND REPUTATION. WE COULD BE ADVERSELY IMPACTED IF WE FAIL TO ACHIEVE ANY OF THESE OBJECTIVES OR IF THE REPUTATION OR IMAGE OF ANY OF OUR BRANDS IS TARNISHED OR RECEIVES NEGATIVE PUBLICITY. IN ADDITION, ADVERSE PUBLICITY ABOUT REGULATORY OR LEGAL ACTION AGAINST US COULD DAMAGE OUR REPUTATION AND BRAND IMAGE, UNDERMINE CONSUMER CONFIDENCE IN US AND REDUCE LONG-TERM DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS, EVEN IF THE REGULATORY OR LEGAL ACTION IS UNFOUNDED OR NOT MATERIAL TO OUR OPERATIONS.

IN ADDITION, OUR SUCCESS IN MAINTAINING, EXTENDING, AND EXPANDING OUR BRAND IMAGE DEPENDS ON OUR ABILITY TO ADAPT TO A RAPIDLY CHANGING MEDIA ENVIRONMENT, INCLUDING OUR INCREASING RELIANCE ON SOCIAL MEDIA AND ONLINE DISSEMINATION OF ADVERTISING CAMPAIGNS. NEGATIVE POSTS OR COMMENTS ABOUT US ON SOCIAL NETWORKING WEBSITES COULD SERIOUSLY DAMAGE OUR REPUTATION AND BRAND IMAGE. IF WE DO NOT MAINTAIN, EXTEND, AND EXPAND OUR BRAND IMAGE, THEN OUR PRODUCT SALES, FINANCIAL CONDITION, AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COULD BE MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

IF WE ARE UNABLE TO ANTICIPATE CONSUMER PREFERENCES AND DEVELOP NEW PRODUCTS, WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO MAINTAIN OR INCREASE OUR REVENUES AND PROFITS.

OUR SUCCESS DEPENDS ON OUR ABILITY TO IDENTIFY, ORIGINATE, AND DEFINE PRODUCT TRENDS AS WELL AS TO ANTICIPATE, GAUGE, AND REACT TO CHANGING CONSUMER DEMANDS IN A TIMELY MANNER. HOWEVER, LEAD TIMES FOR MANY OF OUR PRODUCTS MAY MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR US TO RESPOND RAPIDLY TO NEW OR CHANGING PRODUCT TRENDS OR CONSUMER PREFERENCES. ALL OF OUR PRODUCTS ARE SUBJECT TO CHANGING CONSUMER PREFERENCES THAT CANNOT BE PREDICTED WITH CERTAINTY. OUR NEW PRODUCTS MAY NOT RECEIVE CONSUMER ACCEPTANCE AS CONSUMER PREFERENCES COULD SHIFT RAPIDLY TO DIFFERENT TYPES OF PERFORMANCE PRODUCTS OR AWAY FROM THESE TYPES OF PRODUCTS ALTOGETHER, AND OUR FUTURE SUCCESS DEPENDS IN PART ON OUR ABILITY TO ANTICIPATE AND RESPOND TO THESE CHANGES. IF WE FAIL TO ANTICIPATE ACCURATELY AND RESPOND TO TRENDS AND SHIFTS IN CONSUMER PREFERENCES BY ADJUSTING THE MIX OF EXISTING PRODUCT OFFERINGS, DEVELOPING NEW PRODUCTS, DESIGNS, STYLES, AND CATEGORIES, AND INFLUENCING SPORTS AND FITNESS PREFERENCES THROUGH AGGRESSIVE MARKETING, WE COULD EXPERIENCE LOWER SALES, EXCESS INVENTORIES, OR LOWER PROFIT MARGINS, ANY OF WHICH COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. IN ADDITION, WE MARKET OUR PRODUCTS GLOBALLY THROUGH A DIVERSE SPECTRUM OF ADVERTISING AND PROMOTIONAL PROGRAMS AND CAMPAIGNS, INCLUDING SOCIAL MEDIA AND ONLINE ADVERTISING. IF WE DO NOT SUCCESSFULLY MARKET OUR PRODUCTS OR IF ADVERTISING AND PROMOTIONAL COSTS INCREASE, THESE FACTORS COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

WE RELY ON TECHNICAL INNOVATION AND HIGH-QUALITY PRODUCTS TO COMPETE IN THE MARKET FOR OUR PRODUCTS.

TECHNICAL INNOVATION AND QUALITY CONTROL IN THE DESIGN AND MANUFACTURING PROCESS OF FOOTWEAR, APPAREL, AND ATHLETIC EQUIPMENT IS ESSENTIAL TO THE COMMERCIAL SUCCESS OF OUR PRODUCTS. RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT PLAYS A KEY ROLE IN TECHNICAL INNOVATION. WE RELY UPON SPECIALISTS IN THE FIELDS OF BIOMECHANICS, CHEMISTRY, EXERCISE PHYSIOLOGY, ENGINEERING, INDUSTRIAL DESIGN, SUSTAINABILITY, AND RELATED FIELDS, AS WELL AS RESEARCH COMMITTEES AND ADVISORY BOARDS MADE UP OF ATHLETES, COACHES, TRAINERS, EQUIPMENT MANAGERS, ORTHOPEDISTS, PODIATRISTS, AND OTHER EXPERTS TO DEVELOP AND TEST CUTTING EDGE PERFORMANCE PRODUCTS. WHILE WE STRIVE TO PRODUCE PRODUCTS THAT HELP TO ENHANCE ATHLETIC PERFORMANCE, REDUCE INJURY, AND MAXIMIZE COMFORT, IF WE FAIL TO INTRODUCE TECHNICAL INNOVATION IN OUR PRODUCTS, CONSUMER DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS COULD DECLINE, AND IF WE EXPERIENCE PROBLEMS WITH THE QUALITY OF OUR PRODUCTS, WE MAY INCUR SUBSTANTIAL EXPENSE TO REMEDY THE PROBLEMS.

FAILURE TO CONTINUE TO OBTAIN HIGH QUALITY ENDORSERS OF OUR PRODUCTS COULD HARM OUR BUSINESS.

WE ESTABLISH RELATIONSHIPS WITH PROFESSIONAL ATHLETES, SPORTS TEAMS, AND LEAGUES TO DEVELOP, EVALUATE AND PROMOTE OUR PRODUCTS, AS WELL AS ESTABLISH PRODUCT AUTHENTICITY WITH CONSUMERS. IF CERTAIN ENDORSERS WERE TO STOP USING OUR PRODUCTS CONTRARY TO THEIR ENDORSEMENT AGREEMENTS, OUR BUSINESS COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED. IN ADDITION, ACTIONS TAKEN BY ATHLETES, TEAMS, OR LEAGUES ASSOCIATED WITH OUR PRODUCTS THAT HARM THE REPUTATIONS OF THOSE ATHLETES, TEAMS, OR LEAGUES, COULD ALSO SERIOUSLY HARM OUR BRAND IMAGE WITH CONSUMERS AND, AS A RESULT, COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR SALES AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. IN ADDITION, POOR PERFORMANCE BY OUR ENDORSERS, A FAILURE TO CONTINUE TO CORRECTLY IDENTIFY PROMISING ATHLETES TO USE AND ENDORSE OUR PRODUCTS, OR A FAILURE TO ENTER INTO COST-EFFECTIVE ENDORSEMENT ARRANGEMENTS WITH PROMINENT ATHLETES AND SPORTS ORGANIZATIONS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BRAND, SALES, AND PROFITABILITY.

CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE FLUCTUATIONS COULD RESULT IN LOWER REVENUES, HIGHER COSTS, AND DECREASED MARGINS AND EARNINGS.

A MAJORITY OF OUR PRODUCTS ARE MANUFACTURED AND SOLD OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES. AS A RESULT, WE CONDUCT PURCHASE AND SALE TRANSACTIONS IN VARIOUS CURRENCIES, WHICH INCREASES OUR EXPOSURE TO FLUCTUATIONS IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES GLOBALLY. OUR INTERNATIONAL REVENUES AND EXPENSES GENERALLY ARE DERIVED FROM SALES AND OPERATIONS IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES, AND THESE REVENUES AND EXPENSES COULD BE AFFECTED BY CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS, INCLUDING AMOUNTS RECORDED IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES AND TRANSLATED INTO U.S. DOLLARS FOR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL REPORTING, AS WEAKENING OF FOREIGN CURRENCIES RELATIVE TO THE U.S. DOLLAR ADVERSELY AFFECTS THE U.S. DOLLAR VALUE OF THE COMPANY'S FOREIGN CURRENCY-DENOMINATED SALES AND EARNINGS. CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE FLUCTUATIONS COULD ALSO DISRUPT THE BUSINESS OF THE INDEPENDENT MANUFACTURERS THAT PRODUCE OUR PRODUCTS BY MAKING THEIR PURCHASES OF RAW MATERIALS MORE EXPENSIVE AND MORE DIFFICULT TO FINANCE. FOREIGN CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS HAVE ADVERSELY AFFECTED, AND COULD CONTINUE TO HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

WE MAY HEDGE CERTAIN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXPOSURES TO LESSEN AND DELAY, BUT NOT TO COMPLETELY ELIMINATE, THE EFFECTS OF FOREIGN CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS ON OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS. SINCE THE HEDGING ACTIVITIES ARE DESIGNED TO LESSEN VOLATILITY, THEY NOT ONLY REDUCE THE NEGATIVE IMPACT OF A STRONGER U.S. DOLLAR OR OTHER TRADING CURRENCY, BUT THEY ALSO REDUCE THE POSITIVE IMPACT OF A WEAKER U.S. DOLLAR OR OTHER TRADING CURRENCY. OUR FUTURE FINANCIAL RESULTS COULD BE SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTED BY THE VALUE OF THE U.S. DOLLAR IN RELATION TO THE FOREIGN CURRENCIES IN WHICH WE CONDUCT BUSINESS. THE DEGREE TO WHICH OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS ARE AFFECTED FOR ANY GIVEN TIME PERIOD WILL DEPEND IN PART UPON OUR HEDGING ACTIVITIES.

GLOBAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, OPERATING RESULTS, AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

ALTHOUGH THE GLOBAL ECONOMY HAS BEEN SHOWING SIGNS OF IMPROVEMENT, ITS UNCERTAIN STATE CONTINUES TO IMPACT BUSINESSES AROUND THE WORLD, AND MOST ACUTELY IN EMERGING MARKETS AND DEVELOPING ECONOMIES. CONTINUING UNCERTAINTY IN THE GLOBAL CAPITAL AND CREDIT MARKETS HAVE LED TO FLUCTUATIONS IN THE AVAILABILITY OF BUSINESS CREDIT AND CAPITAL LIQUIDITY, A CONTRACTION OF CONSUMER CREDIT, BUSINESS FAILURES, SUSTAINED UNEMPLOYMENT AT HISTORICALLY HIGH LEVELS, AND DECLINES IN CONSUMER CONFIDENCE AND SPENDING IN MANY PARTS OF THE WORLD. IF GLOBAL ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL MARKET CONDITIONS DO NOT IMPROVE OR DETERIORATE, THE FOLLOWING FACTORS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, OPERATING RESULTS, AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

•

SLOWER CONSUMER SPENDING MAY RESULT IN REDUCED DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS, REDUCED ORDERS FROM RETAILERS FOR OUR PRODUCTS, ORDER CANCELLATIONS, LOWER REVENUES, HIGHER DISCOUNTS, INCREASED INVENTORIES, AND LOWER GROSS MARGINS.

•

IN THE FUTURE, WE MAY BE UNABLE TO ACCESS FINANCING IN THE CREDIT AND CAPITAL MARKETS AT REASONABLE RATES IN THE EVENT WE FIND IT DESIRABLE TO DO SO.

•

WE CONDUCT TRANSACTIONS IN VARIOUS CURRENCIES, WHICH INCREASE OUR EXPOSURE TO FLUCTUATIONS IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES RELATIVE TO THE U.S. DOLLAR. CONTINUED VOLATILITY IN THE MARKETS AND EXCHANGE RATES FOR FOREIGN CURRENCIES AND CONTRACTS IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES COULD HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON OUR REPORTED FINANCIAL RESULTS AND CONDITION.

•

CONTINUED VOLATILITY IN THE AVAILABILITY AND PRICES FOR COMMODITIES AND RAW MATERIALS WE USE IN OUR PRODUCTS AND IN OUR SUPPLY CHAIN (SUCH AS COTTON OR PETROLEUM DERIVATIVES) COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR COSTS, GROSS MARGINS, AND PROFITABILITY.

•

IF RETAILERS OF OUR PRODUCTS EXPERIENCE DECLINING REVENUES, OR EXPERIENCE DIFFICULTY OBTAINING FINANCING IN THE CAPITAL AND CREDIT MARKETS TO PURCHASE OUR PRODUCTS, THIS COULD RESULT IN REDUCED ORDERS FOR OUR PRODUCTS, ORDER CANCELLATIONS, LATE RETAILER PAYMENTS, EXTENDED PAYMENT TERMS, HIGHER ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, REDUCED CASH FLOWS, GREATER EXPENSE ASSOCIATED WITH COLLECTION EFFORTS, AND INCREASED BAD DEBT EXPENSE.

•

IF RETAILERS OF OUR PRODUCTS EXPERIENCE SEVERE FINANCIAL DIFFICULTY, SOME MAY BECOME INSOLVENT AND CEASE BUSINESS OPERATIONS, WHICH COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT THE SALE OF OUR PRODUCTS TO CONSUMERS.

•

IF CONTRACT MANUFACTURERS OF OUR PRODUCTS OR OTHER PARTICIPANTS IN OUR SUPPLY CHAIN EXPERIENCE DIFFICULTY OBTAINING FINANCING IN THE CAPITAL AND CREDIT MARKETS TO PURCHASE RAW MATERIALS OR TO FINANCE CAPITAL EQUIPMENT AND OTHER GENERAL WORKING CAPITAL NEEDS, IT MAY RESULT IN DELAYS OR NON-DELIVERY OF SHIPMENTS OF OUR PRODUCTS.

OUR BUSINESS IS AFFECTED BY SEASONALITY, WHICH COULD RESULT IN FLUCTUATIONS IN OUR OPERATING RESULTS.

WE EXPERIENCE MODERATE FLUCTUATIONS IN AGGREGATE SALES VOLUME DURING THE YEAR. HISTORICALLY, REVENUES IN THE FIRST AND FOURTH FISCAL QUARTERS HAVE SLIGHTLY EXCEEDED THOSE IN THE SECOND AND THIRD FISCAL QUARTERS. HOWEVER, THE MIX OF PRODUCT SALES MAY VARY CONSIDERABLY FROM TIME TO TIME AS A RESULT OF CHANGES IN SEASONAL AND GEOGRAPHIC DEMAND FOR PARTICULAR TYPES OF FOOTWEAR, APPAREL, AND EQUIPMENT. IN ADDITION, OUR CUSTOMERS MAY CANCEL ORDERS, CHANGE DELIVERY SCHEDULES, OR CHANGE THE MIX OF PRODUCTS ORDERED WITH MINIMAL NOTICE. AS A RESULT, WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO ACCURATELY PREDICT OUR QUARTERLY SALES. ACCORDINGLY, OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS ARE LIKELY TO FLUCTUATE SIGNIFICANTLY FROM PERIOD TO PERIOD. THIS SEASONALITY, ALONG WITH OTHER FACTORS THAT ARE BEYOND OUR CONTROL, INCLUDING GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, CHANGES IN CONSUMER PREFERENCES, WEATHER CONDITIONS, AVAILABILITY OF IMPORT QUOTAS, AND CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE FLUCTUATIONS, COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS AND CAUSE OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS TO FLUCTUATE. OUR OPERATING MARGINS ARE ALSO SENSITIVE TO A NUMBER OF ADDITIONAL FACTORS THAT ARE BEYOND OUR CONTROL, INCLUDING MANUFACTURING AND TRANSPORTATION COSTS, SHIFTS IN PRODUCT SALES MIX, AND GEOGRAPHIC SALES TRENDS, ALL OF WHICH WE EXPECT TO CONTINUE. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN ANY PERIOD SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED INDICATIVE OF THE RESULTS TO BE EXPECTED FOR ANY FUTURE PERIOD.

FUTURES ORDERS MAY NOT BE AN ACCURATE INDICATION OF OUR FUTURE REVENUES.

WE MAKE SUBSTANTIAL USE OF OUR FUTURES ORDERING PROGRAM, WHICH ALLOWS RETAILERS TO ORDER FIVE TO SIX MONTHS IN ADVANCE OF DELIVERY WITH THE COMMITMENT THAT THEIR ORDERS WILL BE DELIVERED WITHIN A SET PERIOD OF TIME AT A FIXED PRICE. OUR FUTURES ORDERING PROGRAM ALLOWS US TO MINIMIZE THE AMOUNT OF PRODUCTS WE HOLD IN INVENTORY, PURCHASING COSTS, THE TIME NECESSARY TO FILL CUSTOMER ORDERS, AND THE RISK OF NON-DELIVERY. WE REPORT CHANGES IN FUTURES ORDERS IN OUR PERIODIC FINANCIAL REPORTS. ALTHOUGH WE BELIEVE FUTURES ORDERS ARE AN IMPORTANT INDICATOR OF OUR FUTURE REVENUES, REPORTED FUTURES ORDERS ARE NOT NECESSARILY INDICATIVE OF OUR EXPECTATION OF CHANGES IN REVENUES FOR ANY FUTURE PERIOD. THIS IS BECAUSE THE MIX OF ORDERS CAN SHIFT BETWEEN FUTURES AND AT-ONCE ORDERS. IN ADDITION, FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE FLUCTUATIONS, ORDER CANCELLATIONS, SHIPPING TIMING, RETURNS, AND DISCOUNTS CAN CAUSE DIFFERENCES IN THE COMPARISONS BETWEEN FUTURES ORDERS AND ACTUAL REVENUES. MOREOVER, A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR REVENUE IS NOT DERIVED FROM FUTURES ORDERS, INCLUDING AT-ONCE AND CLOSEOUT SALES OF NIKE BRAND FOOTWEAR AND APPAREL, SALES OF NIKE BRAND EQUIPMENT, SALES FROM OUR DIRECT TO CONSUMER OPERATIONS, AND SALES FROM OUR CONVERSE, HURLEY, AND NIKE GOLF BUSINESSES.

OUR FUTURES ORDERING PROGRAM DOES NOT PREVENT EXCESS INVENTORIES OR INVENTORY SHORTAGES, WHICH COULD RESULT IN DECREASED OPERATING MARGINS, CASH FLOWS AND HARM TO OUR BUSINESS.

WE PURCHASE PRODUCTS FROM MANUFACTURERS OUTSIDE OF OUR FUTURES ORDERING PROGRAM AND IN ADVANCE OF CUSTOMER ORDERS, WHICH WE HOLD IN INVENTORY AND RESELL TO CUSTOMERS. THERE IS A RISK WE MAY BE UNABLE TO SELL EXCESS PRODUCTS ORDERED FROM MANUFACTURERS. INVENTORY LEVELS IN EXCESS OF CUSTOMER DEMAND MAY RESULT IN INVENTORY WRITE-DOWNS, AND THE SALE OF EXCESS INVENTORY AT DISCOUNTED PRICES COULD SIGNIFICANTLY IMPAIR OUR BRAND IMAGE AND HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR OPERATING RESULTS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. CONVERSELY, IF WE UNDERESTIMATE CONSUMER DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS OR IF OUR MANUFACTURERS FAIL TO SUPPLY PRODUCTS WE REQUIRE AT THE TIME WE NEED THEM, WE MAY EXPERIENCE INVENTORY SHORTAGES. INVENTORY SHORTAGES MIGHT DELAY SHIPMENTS TO CUSTOMERS, NEGATIVELY IMPACT RETAILER AND DISTRIBUTOR RELATIONSHIPS, AND DIMINISH BRAND LOYALTY.

THE DIFFICULTY IN FORECASTING DEMAND ALSO MAKES IT DIFFICULT TO ESTIMATE OUR FUTURE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION FROM PERIOD TO PERIOD. A FAILURE TO ACCURATELY PREDICT THE LEVEL OF DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR NET REVENUES AND NET INCOME, AND WE ARE UNLIKELY TO FORECAST SUCH EFFECTS WITH ANY CERTAINTY IN ADVANCE.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

WE MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY THE FINANCIAL HEALTH OF OUR RETAILERS.

WE EXTEND CREDIT TO OUR CUSTOMERS BASED ON AN ASSESSMENT OF A CUSTOMER’S FINANCIAL CONDITION, GENERALLY WITHOUT REQUIRING COLLATERAL. TO ASSIST IN THE SCHEDULING OF PRODUCTION AND THE SHIPPING OF SEASONAL PRODUCTS, WE OFFER CUSTOMERS THE ABILITY TO PLACE ORDERS FIVE TO SIX MONTHS AHEAD OF DELIVERY UNDER OUR FUTURES ORDERING PROGRAM. THESE ADVANCE ORDERS MAY BE CANCELED, AND THE RISK OF CANCELLATION MAY INCREASE WHEN DEALING WITH FINANCIALLY AILING RETAILERS OR RETAILERS STRUGGLING WITH ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTY. IN THE PAST, SOME CUSTOMERS HAVE EXPERIENCED FINANCIAL DIFFICULTIES, WHICH HAVE HAD AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS. WHEN THE RETAIL ECONOMY WEAKENS, RETAILERS MAY BE MORE CAUTIOUS WITH ORDERS. A SLOWING ECONOMY IN OUR KEY MARKETS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE FINANCIAL HEALTH OF OUR CUSTOMERS, WHICH IN TURN COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. IN ADDITION, PRODUCT SALES ARE DEPENDENT IN PART ON HIGH QUALITY MERCHANDISING AND AN APPEALING STORE ENVIRONMENT TO ATTRACT CONSUMERS, WHICH REQUIRES CONTINUING INVESTMENTS BY RETAILERS. RETAILERS THAT EXPERIENCE FINANCIAL DIFFICULTIES MAY FAIL TO MAKE SUCH INVESTMENTS OR DELAY THEM, RESULTING IN LOWER SALES AND ORDERS FOR OUR PRODUCTS.

CONSOLIDATION OF RETAILERS OR CONCENTRATION OF RETAIL MARKET SHARE AMONG A FEW RETAILERS MAY INCREASE AND CONCENTRATE OUR CREDIT RISK, AND IMPAIR OUR ABILITY TO SELL PRODUCTS.

THE ATHLETIC FOOTWEAR, APPAREL, AND EQUIPMENT RETAIL MARKETS IN SOME COUNTRIES ARE DOMINATED BY A FEW LARGE ATHLETIC FOOTWEAR, APPAREL, AND EQUIPMENT RETAILERS WITH MANY STORES. THESE RETAILERS HAVE IN THE PAST INCREASED THEIR MARKET SHARE AND MAY CONTINUE TO DO SO IN THE FUTURE BY EXPANDING THROUGH ACQUISITIONS AND CONSTRUCTION OF ADDITIONAL STORES. THESE SITUATIONS CONCENTRATE OUR CREDIT RISK WITH A RELATIVELY SMALL NUMBER OF RETAILERS, AND, IF ANY OF THESE RETAILERS WERE TO EXPERIENCE A SHORTAGE OF LIQUIDITY, IT WOULD INCREASE THE RISK THAT THEIR OUTSTANDING PAYABLES TO US MAY NOT BE PAID. IN ADDITION, INCREASING MARKET SHARE CONCENTRATION AMONG ONE OR A FEW RETAILERS IN A PARTICULAR COUNTRY OR REGION INCREASES THE RISK THAT IF ANY ONE OF THEM SUBSTANTIALLY REDUCES THEIR PURCHASES OF OUR PRODUCTS, WE MAY BE UNABLE TO FIND A SUFFICIENT NUMBER OF OTHER RETAIL OUTLETS FOR OUR PRODUCTS TO SUSTAIN THE SAME LEVEL OF SALES AND REVENUES.

OUR DIRECT TO CONSUMER OPERATIONS HAVE REQUIRED AND WILL CONTINUE TO REQUIRE A SUBSTANTIAL INVESTMENT AND COMMITMENT OF RESOURCES, AND ARE SUBJECT TO NUMEROUS RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES.

OUR DIRECT TO CONSUMER STORES HAVE REQUIRED SUBSTANTIAL FIXED INVESTMENT IN EQUIPMENT AND LEASEHOLD IMPROVEMENTS, INFORMATION SYSTEMS, INVENTORY, AND PERSONNEL. WE HAVE ENTERED INTO SUBSTANTIAL OPERATING LEASE COMMITMENTS FOR RETAIL SPACE. CERTAIN STORES HAVE BEEN DESIGNED AND BUILT TO SERVE AS HIGH-PROFILE VENUES TO PROMOTE BRAND AWARENESS AND MARKETING ACTIVITIES. BECAUSE OF THEIR UNIQUE DESIGN ELEMENTS, LOCATIONS, AND SIZE, THESE STORES REQUIRE SUBSTANTIALLY MORE INVESTMENT THAN OTHER STORES. DUE TO THE HIGH FIXED-COST STRUCTURE ASSOCIATED WITH OUR DIRECT TO CONSUMER OPERATIONS, A DECLINE IN SALES, OR THE CLOSURE OR POOR PERFORMANCE OF INDIVIDUAL OR MULTIPLE STORES COULD RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT LEASE TERMINATION COSTS, WRITE-OFFS OF EQUIPMENT AND LEASEHOLD IMPROVEMENTS, AND EMPLOYEE-RELATED COSTS.

MANY FACTORS UNIQUE TO RETAIL OPERATIONS, SOME OF WHICH ARE BEYOND THE COMPANY’S CONTROL, POSE RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES. RISKS INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO: CREDIT CARD FRAUD; MISMANAGEMENT OF EXISTING RETAIL CHANNEL PARTNERS; AND INABILITY TO MANAGE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH STORE CONSTRUCTION AND OPERATION. IN ADDITION, EXTREME WEATHER CONDITIONS IN THE AREAS IN WHICH OUR STORES ARE LOCATED COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS. RISKS SPECIFIC TO OUR E-COMMERCE BUSINESS ALSO INCLUDE DIVERSION OF SALES FROM OUR AND OUR RETAILER'S BRICK AND MORTAR STORES, DIFFICULTY IN RECREATING THE IN-STORE EXPERIENCE THROUGH DIRECT CHANNELS, AND LIABILITY FOR ONLINE CONTENT. OUR FAILURE TO SUCCESSFULLY RESPOND TO THESE RISKS MIGHT ADVERSELY AFFECT SALES IN OUR E-COMMERCE BUSINESS, AS WELL AS DAMAGE OUR REPUTATION AND BRANDS.

FAILURE TO ADEQUATELY PROTECT OR ENFORCE OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS.

WE UTILIZE TRADEMARKS ON NEARLY ALL OF OUR PRODUCTS AND BELIEVE THAT HAVING DISTINCTIVE MARKS THAT ARE READILY IDENTIFIABLE IS AN IMPORTANT FACTOR IN CREATING A MARKET FOR OUR GOODS, IN IDENTIFYING US, AND IN DISTINGUISHING OUR GOODS FROM THE GOODS OF OTHERS. WE CONSIDER OUR NIKE AND SWOOSH DESIGN TRADEMARKS TO BE AMONG OUR MOST VALUABLE ASSETS AND WE HAVE REGISTERED THESE TRADEMARKS IN ALMOST 170 JURISDICTIONS. IN ADDITION, WE OWN MANY OTHER TRADEMARKS THAT WE UTILIZE IN MARKETING OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES.

WE BELIEVE THAT OUR TRADEMARKS, PATENTS, TRADE SECRETS, AND OTHER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS ARE IMPORTANT TO OUR BRAND, OUR SUCCESS, AND OUR COMPETITIVE POSITION. WE PERIODICALLY DISCOVER PRODUCTS THAT ARE COUNTERFEIT REPRODUCTIONS OF OUR PRODUCTS OR THAT OTHERWISE INFRINGE ON OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS. IF WE ARE UNSUCCESSFUL IN CHALLENGING A PARTY’S PRODUCTS ON THE BASIS OF TRADE SECRET MISAPPROPRIATION OR TRADEMARK, COPYRIGHT, DESIGN PATENT, UTILITY PATENT, OR OTHER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY INFRINGEMENT, CONTINUED SALES OF THESE PRODUCTS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR SALES AND OUR BRAND AND RESULT IN THE SHIFT OF CONSUMER PREFERENCE AWAY FROM OUR PRODUCTS.

THE ACTIONS WE TAKE TO ESTABLISH AND PROTECT TRADEMARKS, COPYRIGHTS, TRADE SECRETS, PATENTS, AND OTHER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS MAY NOT BE ADEQUATE TO PREVENT IMITATION OF OUR PRODUCTS BY OTHERS OR TO PREVENT OTHERS FROM SEEKING TO BLOCK SALES OF OUR PRODUCTS AS VIOLATIONS OF PROPRIETARY RIGHTS.

WE MAY BE SUBJECT TO LIABILITY IF THIRD PARTIES SUCCESSFULLY CLAIM THAT WE INFRINGE ON THEIR TRADEMARKS, COPYRIGHTS, PATENTS, OR OTHER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS. DEFENDING INFRINGEMENT CLAIMS COULD BE EXPENSIVE AND TIME-CONSUMING AND MIGHT RESULT IN OUR ENTERING INTO COSTLY LICENSE AGREEMENTS. WE ALSO MAY BE SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT DAMAGES OR INJUNCTIONS AGAINST DEVELOPMENT, USE, IMPORTATION, AND/OR SALE OF CERTAIN PRODUCTS.

WE TAKE VARIOUS ACTIONS TO PREVENT CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION FROM UNAUTHORIZED USE AND/OR DISCLOSURE. SUCH ACTIONS INCLUDE CONTRACTUAL MEASURES SUCH AS ENTERING INTO NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENTS AND PROVIDING CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION AWARENESS TRAINING. OUR CONTROLS AND EFFORTS TO PREVENT UNAUTHORIZED USE AND/OR DISCLOSURE OF CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION MIGHT NOT ALWAYS BE EFFECTIVE. CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION THAT IS RELATED TO BUSINESS STRATEGY, NEW TECHNOLOGIES, MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS, UNPUBLISHED FINANCIAL RESULTS, OR PERSONAL DATA COULD BE PREMATURELY OR INADVERTENTLY USED AND/OR DISCLOSED, RESULTING IN A LOSS OF REPUTATION, OR A DECLINE IN OUR STOCK PRICE, OR A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON OUR MARKET POSITION, AND COULD LEAD TO DAMAGES, FINES, PENALTIES, OR INJUNCTIONS.

IN ADDITION, THE LAWS OF CERTAIN FOREIGN COUNTRIES MAY NOT PROTECT OR ALLOW ENFORCEMENT OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS TO THE SAME EXTENT AS THE LAWS OF THE UNITED STATES. WE MAY FACE SIGNIFICANT EXPENSES AND LIABILITY IN CONNECTION WITH THE PROTECTION OF OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES, AND IF WE ARE UNABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY PROTECT OUR RIGHTS OR RESOLVE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY CONFLICTS WITH OTHERS, OUR BUSINESS OR FINANCIAL CONDITION MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

WE ARE SUBJECT TO DATA SECURITY AND PRIVACY RISKS THAT COULD NEGATIVELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS, OPERATIONS OR REPUTATION.

HACKERS AND DATA THIEVES ARE INCREASINGLY SOPHISTICATED AND OPERATE LARGE-SCALE AND COMPLEX AUTOMATED ATTACKS. ANY BREACH OF OUR NETWORK MAY RESULT IN THE LOSS OF VALUABLE BUSINESS DATA, MISAPPROPRIATION OF OUR CONSUMERS’ OR EMPLOYEES’ PERSONAL INFORMATION, OR A DISRUPTION OF OUR BUSINESS, WHICH COULD GIVE RISE TO UNWANTED MEDIA ATTENTION, MATERIALLY DAMAGE OUR CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIPS AND REPUTATION, AND RESULT IN LOST SALES, FINES, OR LAWSUITS.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

IN ADDITION, WE MUST COMPLY WITH INCREASINGLY COMPLEX AND RIGOROUS REGULATORY STANDARDS ENACTED TO PROTECT BUSINESS AND PERSONAL DATA.  ANY FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH THESE REGULATORY STANDARDS COULD SUBJECT US TO LEGAL AND REPUTATIONAL RISKS. MISUSE OF OR FAILURE TO SECURE PERSONAL INFORMATION COULD ALSO RESULT IN VIOLATION OF DATA PRIVACY LAWS AND REGULATIONS, PROCEEDINGS AGAINST THE COMPANY BY GOVERNMENTAL ENTITIES OR OTHERS, DAMAGE TO OUR REPUTATION AND CREDIBILITY, AND COULD HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON REVENUES AND PROFITS.

FAILURE OF OUR CONTRACTORS OR OUR LICENSEES’ CONTRACTORS TO COMPLY WITH OUR CODE OF CONDUCT, LOCAL LAWS, AND OTHER STANDARDS COULD HARM OUR BUSINESS.

WE WORK WITH HUNDREDS OF CONTRACTORS OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES TO MANUFACTURE OUR PRODUCTS, AND WE ALSO HAVE LICENSE AGREEMENTS THAT PERMIT UNAFFILIATED PARTIES TO MANUFACTURE OR CONTRACT FOR THE MANUFACTURE OF PRODUCTS USING OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY. WE REQUIRE THE CONTRACTORS THAT DIRECTLY MANUFACTURE OUR PRODUCTS AND OUR LICENSEES THAT MAKE PRODUCTS USING OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY (INCLUDING, INDIRECTLY, THEIR CONTRACT MANUFACTURERS) TO COMPLY WITH A CODE OF CONDUCT AND OTHER ENVIRONMENTAL, HEALTH, AND SAFETY STANDARDS FOR THE BENEFIT OF WORKERS. WE ALSO REQUIRE THESE CONTRACTORS TO COMPLY WITH APPLICABLE STANDARDS FOR PRODUCT SAFETY. NOTWITHSTANDING THEIR CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS, FROM TIME TO TIME CONTRACTORS MAY NOT COMPLY WITH SUCH STANDARDS OR APPLICABLE LOCAL LAW OR OUR LICENSEES MAY FAIL TO ENFORCE SUCH STANDARDS OR APPLICABLE LOCAL LAW ON THEIR CONTRACTORS. SIGNIFICANT OR CONTINUING NONCOMPLIANCE WITH SUCH STANDARDS AND LAWS BY ONE OR MORE CONTRACTORS COULD HARM OUR REPUTATION OR RESULT IN A PRODUCT RECALL AND, AS A RESULT, COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR SALES AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS INVOLVE INHERENT RISKS WHICH COULD RESULT IN HARM TO OUR BUSINESS.

VIRTUALLY ALL OF OUR ATHLETIC FOOTWEAR AND APPAREL IS MANUFACTURED OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES, AND THE MAJORITY OF OUR PRODUCTS ARE SOLD OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES. ACCORDINGLY, WE ARE SUBJECT TO THE RISKS GENERALLY ASSOCIATED WITH GLOBAL TRADE AND DOING BUSINESS ABROAD, WHICH INCLUDE FOREIGN LAWS AND REGULATIONS, VARYING CONSUMER PREFERENCES ACROSS GEOGRAPHIC REGIONS, POLITICAL UNREST, DISRUPTIONS OR DELAYS IN CROSS-BORDER SHIPMENTS, AND CHANGES IN ECONOMIC CONDITIONS IN COUNTRIES IN WHICH WE MANUFACTURE OR SELL PRODUCTS. IN ADDITION, DISEASE OUTBREAKS, TERRORIST ACTS, AND MILITARY CONFLICT HAVE INCREASED THE RISKS OF DOING BUSINESS ABROAD. THESE FACTORS, AMONG OTHERS, COULD AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO MANUFACTURE PRODUCTS OR PROCURE MATERIALS, OUR ABILITY TO IMPORT PRODUCTS, OUR ABILITY TO SELL PRODUCTS IN INTERNATIONAL MARKETS, AND OUR COST OF DOING BUSINESS. IF ANY OF THESE OR OTHER FACTORS MAKE THE CONDUCT OF BUSINESS IN A PARTICULAR COUNTRY UNDESIRABLE OR IMPRACTICAL, OUR BUSINESS COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED. IN ADDITION, MANY OF OUR IMPORTED PRODUCTS ARE SUBJECT TO DUTIES, TARIFFS, OR QUOTAS THAT AFFECT THE COST AND QUANTITY OF VARIOUS TYPES OF GOODS IMPORTED INTO THE UNITED STATES AND OTHER COUNTRIES. ANY COUNTRY IN WHICH OUR PRODUCTS ARE PRODUCED OR SOLD MAY ELIMINATE, ADJUST, OR IMPOSE NEW QUOTAS, DUTIES, TARIFFS, SAFEGUARD MEASURES, ANTI-DUMPING DUTIES, CARGO RESTRICTIONS TO PREVENT TERRORISM, RESTRICTIONS ON THE TRANSFER OF CURRENCY, CLIMATE CHANGE LEGISLATION, PRODUCT SAFETY REGULATIONS, OR OTHER CHARGES OR RESTRICTIONS, ANY OF WHICH COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

CHANGES IN TAX LAWS AND UNANTICIPATED TAX LIABILITIES COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE AND PROFITABILITY.

WE ARE SUBJECT TO INCOME TAXES IN THE UNITED STATES AND NUMEROUS FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS. WE EARN A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF OUR INCOME IN FOREIGN COUNTRIES. IF OUR CAPITAL OR FINANCING NEEDS IN THE UNITED STATES REQUIRE US TO REPATRIATE EARNINGS FROM FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS ABOVE OUR CURRENT LEVELS, OUR EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATES FOR THE AFFECTED PERIODS COULD BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED. CURRENT ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL CONDITIONS MAKE TAX RULES IN ANY JURISDICTION, INCLUDING THE UNITED STATES, SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT CHANGE. THERE HAVE BEEN PROPOSALS TO REFORM U.S. AND FOREIGN TAX LAWS THAT COULD SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT HOW U.S. MULTINATIONAL CORPORATIONS ARE TAXED ON FOREIGN EARNINGS. ALTHOUGH WE CANNOT PREDICT WHETHER OR IN WHAT FORM THESE PROPOSALS WILL PASS, SEVERAL OF THE PROPOSALS CONSIDERED, IF ENACTED INTO LAW, COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR INCOME TAX EXPENSE AND CASH FLOWS.

OUR EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE IN THE FUTURE COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING CHANGES IN THE MIX OF EARNINGS IN COUNTRIES WITH DIFFERING STATUTORY TAX RATES, CHANGES IN THE VALUATION OF DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, CHANGES IN TAX LAWS, THE OUTCOME OF INCOME TAX AUDITS IN VARIOUS JURISDICTIONS AROUND THE WORLD, AND ANY REPATRIATION OF NON-U.S. EARNINGS FOR WHICH WE HAVE NOT PREVIOUSLY PROVIDED FOR U.S. TAXES.

WE AND OUR SUBSIDIARIES ARE ENGAGED IN A NUMBER OF INTERCOMPANY TRANSACTIONS ACROSS MULTIPLE TAX JURISDICTIONS. ALTHOUGH WE BELIEVE THAT THESE TRANSACTIONS REFLECT THE ACCURATE ECONOMIC ALLOCATION OF PROFIT AND THAT THE PROPER TRANSFER PRICING DOCUMENTATION IS IN PLACE, THE PROFIT ALLOCATION AND TRANSFER PRICING TERMS AND CONDITIONS (REQUIRED TO BE ARM'S LENGTH) MAY BE SCRUTINIZED BY LOCAL TAX AUTHORITIES DURING AN AUDIT AND ANY RESULTING CHANGES MAY IMPACT OUR MIX OF EARNINGS IN COUNTRIES WITH DIFFERING STATUTORY TAX RATES.

PORTIONS OF OUR OPERATIONS ARE SUBJECT TO A REDUCED TAX RATE OR ARE FREE OF TAX UNDER VARIOUS TAX HOLIDAYS AND RULINGS THAT EXPIRE IN WHOLE OR IN PART FROM TIME TO TIME. THESE TAX HOLIDAYS AND RULINGS MAY BE EXTENDED WHEN CERTAIN CONDITIONS ARE MET, OR TERMINATED IF CERTAIN CONDITIONS ARE NOT MET.  IF THE TAX HOLIDAYS AND RULINGS ARE NOT EXTENDED, OR IF WE FAIL TO SATISFY THE CONDITIONS OF THE REDUCED TAX RATE, THEN OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE WOULD INCREASE IN THE FUTURE.

WE ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO THE EXAMINATION OF OUR TAX RETURNS BY THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE AND OTHER TAX AUTHORITIES. WE REGULARLY ASSESS ALL OF THESE MATTERS TO DETERMINE THE ADEQUACY OF OUR TAX PROVISION, WHICH IS SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT DISCRETION. ALTHOUGH WE BELIEVE OUR TAX PROVISIONS ARE ADEQUATE, THE FINAL DETERMINATION OF TAX AUDITS AND ANY RELATED DISPUTES COULD BE MATERIALLY DIFFERENT FROM OUR HISTORICAL INCOME TAX PROVISIONS AND ACCRUALS. THE RESULTS OF AUDITS OR RELATED DISPUTES COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE PERIOD OR PERIODS FOR WHICH THE APPLICABLE FINAL DETERMINATIONS ARE MADE.

IF ONE OR MORE OF OUR COUNTERPARTY FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS DEFAULT ON THEIR OBLIGATIONS TO US OR FAIL, WE MAY INCUR SIGNIFICANT LOSSES.

AS PART OF OUR HEDGING ACTIVITIES, WE ENTER INTO TRANSACTIONS INVOLVING DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, WHICH MAY INCLUDE FORWARD CONTRACTS, COMMODITY FUTURES CONTRACTS, OPTION CONTRACTS, COLLARS, AND SWAPS WITH VARIOUS FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. IN ADDITION, WE HAVE SIGNIFICANT AMOUNTS OF CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS, AND OTHER INVESTMENTS ON DEPOSIT OR IN ACCOUNTS WITH BANKS OR OTHER FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS IN THE UNITED STATES AND ABROAD. AS A RESULT, WE ARE EXPOSED TO THE RISK OF DEFAULT BY OR FAILURE OF COUNTERPARTY FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. THE RISK OF COUNTERPARTY DEFAULT OR FAILURE MAY BE HEIGHTENED DURING ECONOMIC DOWNTURNS AND PERIODS OF UNCERTAINTY IN THE FINANCIAL MARKETS. IF ONE OF OUR COUNTERPARTIES WERE TO BECOME INSOLVENT OR FILE FOR BANKRUPTCY, OUR ABILITY TO RECOVER LOSSES INCURRED AS A RESULT OF DEFAULT OR OUR ASSETS THAT ARE DEPOSITED OR HELD IN ACCOUNTS WITH SUCH COUNTERPARTY MAY BE LIMITED BY THE COUNTERPARTY’S LIQUIDITY OR THE APPLICABLE LAWS GOVERNING THE INSOLVENCY OR BANKRUPTCY PROCEEDINGS. IN THE EVENT OF DEFAULT OR FAILURE OF ONE OR MORE OF OUR COUNTERPARTIES, WE COULD INCUR SIGNIFICANT LOSSES, WHICH COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

WE RELY ON A CONCENTRATED SOURCE BASE OF CONTRACT MANUFACTURERS TO SUPPLY A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR FOOTWEAR PRODUCTS.

NIKE IS SUPPLIED BY APPROXIMATELY 150 FOOTWEAR FACTORIES LOCATED IN 14 COUNTRIES. WE DO NOT OWN OR OPERATE ANY OF OUR OWN MANUFACTURING FACILITIES AND DEPEND UPON INDEPENDENT CONTRACT MANUFACTURERS TO MANUFACTURE ALL OF THE PRODUCTS WE SELL. IN FISCAL 2014, FIVE FOOTWEAR CONTRACT MANUFACTURERS EACH ACCOUNTED FOR GREATER THAN 10% OF FISCAL 2014 FOOTWEAR PRODUCTION, AND IN AGGREGATE ACCOUNTED FOR APPROXIMATELY 67% OF NIKE BRAND FOOTWEAR PRODUCTION IN FISCAL 2014. OUR ABILITY TO MEET OUR CUSTOMERS' NEEDS DEPENDS ON OUR ABILITY TO MAINTAIN A STEADY SUPPLY OF PRODUCTS FROM OUR INDEPENDENT CONTRACT MANUFACTURERS. IF ONE OR MORE OF OUR SIGNIFICANT SUPPLIERS WERE TO SEVER THEIR RELATIONSHIP WITH US OR SIGNIFICANTLY ALTER THE TERMS OF OUR RELATIONSHIP, WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO OBTAIN REPLACEMENT PRODUCTS IN A TIMELY MANNER, WHICH COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR SALES, FINANCIAL CONDITION, OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. ADDITIONALLY, IF ANY OF OUR PRIMARY CONTRACT MANUFACTURERS FAIL TO MAKE TIMELY SHIPMENTS, DO NOT MEET OUR QUALITY STANDARDS, OR OTHERWISE FAIL TO DELIVER US PRODUCT IN ACCORDANCE WITH OUR PLANS, THERE COULD BE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

OUR PRODUCTS ARE SUBJECT TO RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH OVERSEAS SOURCING, MANUFACTURING, AND FINANCING.

THE PRINCIPAL MATERIALS USED IN OUR APPAREL PRODUCTS — NATURAL AND SYNTHETIC FABRICS AND THREADS, SPECIALIZED PERFORMANCE FABRICS DESIGNED TO EFFICIENTLY WICK MOISTURE AWAY FROM THE BODY, RETAIN HEAT, OR REPEL RAIN AND/OR SNOW AS WELL AS PLASTIC AND METAL HARDWARE — ARE AVAILABLE IN COUNTRIES WHERE OUR MANUFACTURING TAKES PLACE. THE PRINCIPAL MATERIALS USED IN OUR FOOTWEAR PRODUCTS — NATURAL AND SYNTHETIC RUBBER, PLASTIC COMPOUNDS, FOAM CUSHIONING MATERIALS, NYLON, LEATHER, CANVAS, AND POLYURETHANE FILMS — ARE ALSO LOCALLY AVAILABLE TO MANUFACTURERS. BOTH OUR APPAREL AND FOOTWEAR PRODUCTS ARE DEPENDENT UPON THE ABILITY OF OUR UNAFFILIATED CONTRACT MANUFACTURERS TO LOCATE, TRAIN, AND EMPLOY ADEQUATE PERSONNEL.  NIKE CONTRACTORS AND SUPPLIERS BUY RAW MATERIALS IN BULK AND ARE SUBJECT TO WAGE RATES THAT ARE OFTENTIMES REGULATED BY THE GOVERNMENTS OF THE COUNTRIES IN WHICH OUR PRODUCTS ARE MANUFACTURED.

THERE COULD BE A SIGNIFICANT DISRUPTION IN THE SUPPLY OF FABRICS OR RAW MATERIALS FROM CURRENT SOURCES OR, IN THE EVENT OF A DISRUPTION, OUR CONTRACT MANUFACTURERS MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO LOCATE ALTERNATIVE SUPPLIERS OF MATERIALS OF COMPARABLE QUALITY AT AN ACCEPTABLE PRICE, OR AT ALL. FURTHER, OUR UNAFFILIATED CONTRACT MANUFACTURERS HAVE EXPERIENCED AND MAY CONTINUE TO EXPERIENCE IN THE FUTURE, UNEXPECTED INCREASES IN WORK WAGES, WHETHER GOVERNMENT MANDATED OR OTHERWISE. IN ADDITION, WE CANNOT BE CERTAIN THAT OUR UNAFFILIATED MANUFACTURERS WILL BE ABLE TO FILL OUR ORDERS IN A TIMELY MANNER. IF WE EXPERIENCE SIGNIFICANT INCREASES IN DEMAND, OR REDUCTIONS IN THE AVAILABILITY OF MATERIALS, OR NEED TO REPLACE AN EXISTING MANUFACTURER, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT ADDITIONAL SUPPLIES OF FABRICS OR RAW MATERIALS OR ADDITIONAL MANUFACTURING CAPACITY WILL BE AVAILABLE WHEN REQUIRED ON TERMS THAT ARE ACCEPTABLE TO US, OR AT ALL, OR THAT ANY SUPPLIER OR MANUFACTURER WOULD ALLOCATE SUFFICIENT CAPACITY TO US IN ORDER TO MEET OUR REQUIREMENTS. IN ADDITION, EVEN IF WE ARE ABLE TO EXPAND EXISTING OR FIND NEW MANUFACTURING OR SOURCES OF MATERIALS, WE MAY ENCOUNTER DELAYS IN PRODUCTION AND ADDED COSTS AS A RESULT OF THE TIME IT TAKES TO TRAIN SUPPLIERS AND MANUFACTURERS IN OUR METHODS, PRODUCTS, QUALITY CONTROL STANDARDS, AND LABOR, HEALTH, AND SAFETY STANDARDS. ANY DELAYS, INTERRUPTION, OR INCREASED COSTS IN LABOR OR WAGES, OR THE SUPPLY OF MATERIALS OR MANUFACTURE OF OUR PRODUCTS COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR ABILITY TO MEET RETAIL CUSTOMER AND CONSUMER DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS AND RESULT IN LOWER REVENUES AND NET INCOME BOTH IN THE SHORT- AND LONG- TERM.

BECAUSE INDEPENDENT MANUFACTURERS MANUFACTURE A MAJORITY OF OUR PRODUCTS OUTSIDE OF OUR PRINCIPAL SALES MARKETS, OUR PRODUCTS MUST BE TRANSPORTED BY THIRD PARTIES OVER LARGE GEOGRAPHIC DISTANCES. DELAYS IN THE SHIPMENT OR DELIVERY OF OUR PRODUCTS DUE TO THE AVAILABILITY OF TRANSPORTATION, WORK STOPPAGES, PORT STRIKES, INFRASTRUCTURE CONGESTION, OR OTHER FACTORS, AND COSTS AND DELAYS ASSOCIATED WITH CONSOLIDATING OR TRANSITIONING BETWEEN MANUFACTURERS, COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE. IN ADDITION, MANUFACTURING DELAYS OR UNEXPECTED DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS MAY REQUIRE US TO USE FASTER, BUT MORE EXPENSIVE, TRANSPORTATION METHODS SUCH AS AIR FREIGHT, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR PROFIT MARGINS. THE COST OF OIL IS A SIGNIFICANT COMPONENT IN MANUFACTURING AND TRANSPORTATION COSTS, SO INCREASES IN THE PRICE OF PETROLEUM PRODUCTS CAN ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR PROFIT MARGINS.

IN ADDITION, SOJITZ AMERICA PERFORMS SIGNIFICANT IMPORT-EXPORT FINANCING SERVICES FOR THE COMPANY. DURING FISCAL 2014, SOJITZ AMERICA PROVIDED FINANCING AND PURCHASING SERVICES FOR NIKE BRAND PRODUCTS SOLD IN CERTAIN NIKE MARKETS INCLUDING ARGENTINA, URUGUAY, CANADA, BRAZIL, INDIA, INDONESIA, THE PHILIPPINES, MALAYSIA, SOUTH AFRICA, AND THAILAND (COLLECTIVELY THE "SOJITZ MARKETS"), EXCLUDING PRODUCTS PRODUCED AND SOLD IN THE SAME COUNTRY. ANY FAILURE OF SOJITZ AMERICA TO PROVIDE THESE SERVICES OR ANY FAILURE OF SOJITZ AMERICA’S BANKS COULD DISRUPT OUR ABILITY TO ACQUIRE PRODUCTS FROM OUR SUPPLIERS AND TO DELIVER PRODUCTS TO OUR CUSTOMERS IN THE SOJITZ MARKETS. SUCH A DISRUPTION COULD RESULT IN CANCELED ORDERS THAT WOULD ADVERSELY AFFECT SALES AND PROFITABILITY.

OUR SUCCESS DEPENDS ON OUR GLOBAL DISTRIBUTION FACILITIES.

WE DISTRIBUTE OUR PRODUCTS TO CUSTOMERS DIRECTLY FROM THE FACTORY AND THROUGH DISTRIBUTION CENTERS LOCATED THROUGHOUT THE WORLD. OUR ABILITY TO MEET CUSTOMER EXPECTATIONS, MANAGE INVENTORY, COMPLETE SALES, AND ACHIEVE OBJECTIVES FOR OPERATING EFFICIENCIES AND GROWTH, PARTICULARLY IN EMERGING MARKETS, DEPENDS ON THE PROPER OPERATION OF OUR DISTRIBUTION FACILITIES, THE DEVELOPMENT OR EXPANSION OF ADDITIONAL DISTRIBUTION CAPABILITIES, AND THE TIMELY PERFORMANCE OF SERVICES BY THIRD PARTIES (INCLUDING THOSE INVOLVED IN SHIPPING PRODUCT TO AND FROM OUR DISTRIBUTION FACILITIES). OUR DISTRIBUTION FACILITIES COULD BE INTERRUPTED BY INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY PROBLEMS AND DISASTERS SUCH AS EARTHQUAKES OR FIRES. ANY SIGNIFICANT FAILURE IN OUR DISTRIBUTION FACILITIES COULD RESULT IN AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS. WE MAINTAIN BUSINESS INTERRUPTION INSURANCE, BUT IT MAY NOT ADEQUATELY PROTECT US FROM ADVERSE EFFECTS THAT COULD BE CAUSED BY SIGNIFICANT DISRUPTIONS IN OUR DISTRIBUTION FACILITIES.

WE RELY SIGNIFICANTLY ON INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY TO OPERATE OUR BUSINESS, INCLUDING OUR SUPPLY CHAIN AND RETAIL OPERATIONS, AND ANY FAILURE, INADEQUACY, OR INTERRUPTION OF THAT TECHNOLOGY COULD HARM OUR ABILITY TO EFFECTIVELY OPERATE OUR BUSINESS.

WE ARE HEAVILY DEPENDENT ON INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS AND NETWORKS, INCLUDING THE INTERNET AND THIRD-PARTY HOSTED SERVICES (“INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS”), ACROSS OUR SUPPLY CHAIN, INCLUDING PRODUCT DESIGN, PRODUCTION, FORECASTING, ORDERING, MANUFACTURING, TRANSPORTATION, SALES, AND DISTRIBUTION, AS WELL AS FOR PROCESSING FINANCIAL INFORMATION FOR EXTERNAL AND INTERNAL REPORTING PURPOSES, RETAIL OPERATIONS, AND OTHER BUSINESS ACTIVITIES. OUR ABILITY TO EFFECTIVELY MANAGE AND MAINTAIN OUR INVENTORY AND TO SHIP PRODUCTS TO CUSTOMERS ON A TIMELY BASIS DEPENDS SIGNIFICANTLY ON THE RELIABILITY OF THESE INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS. OVER A NUMBER OF YEARS, WE HAVE IMPLEMENTED INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS IN ALL OF THE GEOGRAPHICAL REGIONS IN WHICH WE OPERATE. OUR WORK TO INTEGRATE AND ENHANCE THESE SYSTEMS AND RELATED PROCESSES IN OUR GLOBAL OPERATIONS IS ONGOING. THE FAILURE OF THESE SYSTEMS TO OPERATE EFFECTIVELY OR PROBLEMS WITH TRANSITIONING TO UPGRADED OR REPLACEMENT SYSTEMS COULD CAUSE DELAYS IN PRODUCT FULFILLMENT AND REDUCED EFFICIENCY OF OUR OPERATIONS, COULD REQUIRE SIGNIFICANT CAPITAL INVESTMENTS TO REMEDIATE THE PROBLEM, AND MAY HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

WE ALSO USE INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS TO PROCESS FINANCIAL INFORMATION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR INTERNAL REPORTING PURPOSES AND TO COMPLY WITH REGULATORY FINANCIAL REPORTING, LEGAL, AND TAX REQUIREMENTS. IF OUR INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS SUFFER SEVERE DAMAGE, DISRUPTION, OR SHUTDOWN

11

TABLE OF CONTENTS

AND OUR BUSINESS CONTINUITY PLANS DO NOT EFFECTIVELY RESOLVE THE ISSUES IN A TIMELY MANNER, WE COULD EXPERIENCE DELAYS IN REPORTING OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS, WHICH COULD RESULT IN LOST REVENUES AND PROFITS, AS WELL AS REPUTATIONAL DAMAGE. FURTHERMORE, WE DEPEND ON INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS AND PERSONAL DATA COLLECTION AND USE FOR DIGITAL MARKETING, DIGITAL COMMERCE, AND THE MARKETING AND USE OF OUR DIGITAL SPORT PRODUCTS. WE ALSO ENGAGE IN ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATIONS THROUGHOUT THE WORLD BETWEEN AND AMONG OUR EMPLOYEES AS WELL AS WITH OTHER THIRD PARTIES, INCLUDING CUSTOMERS, SUPPLIERS, VENDORS, AND CONSUMERS. OUR INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS ARE CRITICAL TO MANY OF OUR OPERATING ACTIVITIES AND OUR BUSINESS PROCESSES AND MAY BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY ANY SERVICE INTERRUPTION OR SHUTDOWN.

THE MARKET FOR PRIME REAL ESTATE IS COMPETITIVE.

OUR ABILITY TO EFFECTIVELY OBTAIN REAL ESTATE TO OPEN NEW RETAIL STORES AND OTHERWISE CONDUCT OUR OPERATIONS, BOTH DOMESTICALLY AND INTERNATIONALLY, DEPENDS ON THE AVAILABILITY OF REAL ESTATE THAT MEETS OUR CRITERIA FOR TRAFFIC, SQUARE FOOTAGE, CO-TENANCIES, LEASE ECONOMICS, DEMOGRAPHICS, AND OTHER FACTORS. WE ALSO MUST BE ABLE TO EFFECTIVELY RENEW OUR EXISTING REAL ESTATE LEASES. IN ADDITION, FROM TIME TO TIME, WE SEEK TO DOWNSIZE, CONSOLIDATE, REPOSITION, OR CLOSE SOME OF OUR REAL ESTATE LOCATIONS, WHICH MAY REQUIRE MODIFICATION OF AN EXISTING LEASE. FAILURE TO SECURE ADEQUATE NEW LOCATIONS OR SUCCESSFULLY MODIFY LEASES FOR EXISTING LOCATIONS, OR FAILURE TO EFFECTIVELY MANAGE THE PROFITABILITY OF OUR EXISTING FLEET OF RETAIL STORES, COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR OPERATING RESULTS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

ADDITIONALLY, THE ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT MAY AT TIMES MAKE IT DIFFICULT TO DETERMINE THE FAIR MARKET RENT OF REAL ESTATE PROPERTIES DOMESTICALLY AND INTERNATIONALLY. THIS COULD IMPACT THE QUALITY OF OUR DECISIONS TO EXERCISE LEASE OPTIONS AT PREVIOUSLY NEGOTIATED RENTS AND TO RENEW EXPIRING LEASES AT NEGOTIATED RENTS. ANY ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE QUALITY OF THESE DECISIONS COULD IMPACT OUR ABILITY TO RETAIN REAL ESTATE LOCATIONS ADEQUATE TO MEET OUR TARGETS OR EFFICIENTLY MANAGE THE PROFITABILITY OF OUR EXISTING FLEET OF STORES, WHICH COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR OPERATING RESULTS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

EXTREME WEATHER CONDITIONS AND NATURAL DISASTERS COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR OPERATING RESULTS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

EXTREME WEATHER CONDITIONS IN THE AREAS IN WHICH OUR RETAIL STORES, SUPPLIERS, CUSTOMERS, AND VENDORS ARE LOCATED COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR OPERATING RESULTS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.  MOREOVER, NATURAL DISASTERS SUCH AS EARTHQUAKES, HURRICANES, AND TSUNAMIS, WHETHER OCCURRING IN THE UNITED STATES OR ABROAD, AND THEIR RELATED CONSEQUENCES AND EFFECTS, INCLUDING ENERGY SHORTAGES AND PUBLIC HEALTH ISSUES, COULD DISRUPT OUR OPERATIONS, THE OPERATIONS OF OUR VENDORS AND OTHER SUPPLIERS, OR RESULT IN ECONOMIC INSTABILITY THAT MAY NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR OPERATING RESULTS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED IF SUBSTANTIAL INVESTMENTS IN BUSINESSES AND OPERATIONS FAIL TO PRODUCE EXPECTED RETURNS.

FROM TIME TO TIME, WE MAY INVEST IN BUSINESS INFRASTRUCTURE, NEW BUSINESSES, PRODUCT OFFERING AND MANUFACTURING INNOVATION, AND EXPANSION OF EXISTING BUSINESSES, SUCH AS OUR RETAIL OPERATIONS, WHICH REQUIRE SUBSTANTIAL CASH INVESTMENTS AND MANAGEMENT ATTENTION. WE BELIEVE COST-EFFECTIVE INVESTMENTS ARE ESSENTIAL TO BUSINESS GROWTH AND PROFITABILITY. HOWEVER, SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS ARE SUBJECT TO TYPICAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES INHERENT IN DEVELOPING A NEW BUSINESS OR EXPANDING AN EXISTING BUSINESS. THE FAILURE OF ANY SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT TO PROVIDE EXPECTED RETURNS OR PROFITABILITY COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS AND DIVERT MANAGEMENT ATTENTION FROM MORE PROFITABLE BUSINESS OPERATIONS.

WE ARE SUBJECT TO PERIODIC LITIGATION AND OTHER REGULATORY PROCEEDINGS, WHICH COULD RESULT IN UNEXPECTED EXPENSE OF TIME AND RESOURCES.

FROM TIME TO TIME WE ARE CALLED UPON TO DEFEND OURSELVES AGAINST LAWSUITS AND REGULATORY ACTIONS RELATING TO OUR BUSINESS. DUE TO THE INHERENT UNCERTAINTIES OF LITIGATION AND REGULATORY PROCEEDINGS, WE CANNOT ACCURATELY PREDICT THE ULTIMATE OUTCOME OF ANY SUCH PROCEEDINGS. AN UNFAVORABLE OUTCOME COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. IN ADDITION, ANY SIGNIFICANT LITIGATION IN THE FUTURE, REGARDLESS OF ITS MERITS, COULD DIVERT MANAGEMENT’S ATTENTION FROM OUR OPERATIONS AND RESULT IN SUBSTANTIAL LEGAL FEES.

WE DEPEND ON KEY PERSONNEL, THE LOSS OF WHOM WOULD HARM OUR BUSINESS.

OUR FUTURE SUCCESS WILL DEPEND IN PART ON THE CONTINUED SERVICE OF KEY EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AND PERSONNEL. THE LOSS OF THE SERVICES OF ANY KEY INDIVIDUAL COULD HARM OUR BUSINESS. OUR FUTURE SUCCESS ALSO DEPENDS ON OUR ABILITY TO RECRUIT, RETAIN, AND MOTIVATE OUR PERSONNEL SUFFICIENTLY, BOTH TO MAINTAIN OUR CURRENT BUSINESS AND TO EXECUTE OUR STRATEGIC INITIATIVES. COMPETITION FOR EMPLOYEES IN OUR INDUSTRY IS INTENSE AND WE MAY NOT BE SUCCESSFUL IN ATTRACTING AND RETAINING SUCH PERSONNEL.

THE SALE OF A LARGE NUMBER OF SHARES HELD BY OUR CHAIRMAN COULD DEPRESS THE MARKET PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK.

AS OF JUNE 30, 2014, PHILIP H. KNIGHT, CO-FOUNDER AND CHAIRMAN OF OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS, BENEFICIALLY OWNED MORE THAN 75.1% OF OUR CLASS A COMMON STOCK. IF ON JUNE 30, 2014 ALL OF HIS CLASS A COMMON STOCK WERE CONVERTED INTO CLASS B COMMON STOCK, MR. KNIGHT WOULD HAVE OWNED MORE THAN 16.2% OF OUR CLASS B COMMON STOCK. THESE SHARES ARE AVAILABLE FOR RESALE, SUBJECT TO THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE U.S. SECURITIES LAWS. THE SALE OR PROSPECT OF THE SALE OF A SUBSTANTIAL NUMBER OF THESE SHARES COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE MARKET PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK.

CHANGES IN OUR CREDIT RATINGS OR MACROECONOMIC CONDITIONS MAY AFFECT OUR LIQUIDITY, INCREASING BORROWING COSTS AND LIMITING OUR FINANCING OPTIONS.

OUR LONG-TERM DEBT IS CURRENTLY RATED INVESTMENT GRADE BY STANDARD & POOR’S AND MOODY’S INVESTORS SERVICE. IF OUR CREDIT RATINGS ARE LOWERED, BORROWING COSTS FOR FUTURE LONG-TERM DEBT OR SHORT-TERM CREDIT FACILITIES MAY INCREASE AND OUR FINANCING OPTIONS, INCLUDING OUR ACCESS TO THE UNSECURED CREDIT MARKET, COULD BE LIMITED. WE MAY ALSO BE SUBJECT TO RESTRICTIVE COVENANTS THAT WOULD REDUCE OUR FLEXIBILITY. IN ADDITION, MACROECONOMIC CONDITIONS, SUCH AS INCREASED VOLATILITY OR DISRUPTION IN THE CREDIT MARKETS, COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO REFINANCE EXISTING DEBT OR OBTAIN ADDITIONAL FINANCING TO SUPPORT OPERATIONS OR TO FUND NEW INITIATIVES.

ANTI-TAKEOVER PROVISIONS MAY IMPAIR AN ACQUISITION OF THE COMPANY OR REDUCE THE PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK.

THERE ARE PROVISIONS OF OUR ARTICLES OF INCORPORATION AND OREGON LAW THAT ARE INTENDED TO PROTECT SHAREHOLDER INTERESTS BY PROVIDING THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS A MEANS TO ATTEMPT TO DENY COERCIVE TAKEOVER ATTEMPTS OR TO NEGOTIATE WITH A POTENTIAL ACQUIRER IN ORDER TO OBTAIN MORE FAVORABLE TERMS. SUCH PROVISIONS INCLUDE A CONTROL SHARE ACQUISITION STATUTE, A FREEZE-OUT STATUTE, TWO CLASSES OF STOCK THAT VOTE SEPARATELY ON CERTAIN ISSUES, AND THE FACT THAT HOLDERS OF CLASS A COMMON STOCK ELECT THREE-QUARTERS OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS ROUNDED DOWN TO THE NEXT WHOLE NUMBER. HOWEVER, SUCH PROVISIONS COULD DISCOURAGE, DELAY OR PREVENT AN UNSOLICITED MERGER, ACQUISITION, OR OTHER CHANGE IN CONTROL OF OUR COMPANY THAT SOME

12

TABLE OF CONTENTS

SHAREHOLDERS MIGHT BELIEVE TO BE IN THEIR BEST INTERESTS OR IN WHICH SHAREHOLDERS MIGHT RECEIVE A PREMIUM FOR THEIR COMMON STOCK OVER THE PREVAILING MARKET PRICE. THESE PROVISIONS COULD ALSO DISCOURAGE PROXY CONTESTS FOR CONTROL OF THE COMPANY.

WE MAY FAIL TO MEET MARKET EXPECTATIONS, WHICH COULD CAUSE THE PRICE OF OUR STOCK TO DECLINE.

OUR CLASS B COMMON STOCK IS TRADED PUBLICLY, AND AT ANY GIVEN TIME VARIOUS SECURITIES ANALYSTS FOLLOW OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS AND ISSUE REPORTS ON US. THESE REPORTS INCLUDE INFORMATION ABOUT OUR HISTORICAL FINANCIAL RESULTS AS WELL AS ANALYSTS’ ESTIMATES OF OUR FUTURE PERFORMANCE. ANALYSTS’ ESTIMATES ARE BASED UPON THEIR OWN OPINIONS AND ARE OFTEN DIFFERENT FROM OUR ESTIMATES OR EXPECTATIONS. IF OUR OPERATING RESULTS ARE BELOW THE ESTIMATES OR EXPECTATIONS OF PUBLIC MARKET ANALYSTS AND INVESTORS, OUR STOCK PRICE COULD DECLINE. IN THE PAST, SECURITIES CLASS ACTION LITIGATION HAS BEEN BROUGHT AGAINST NIKE AND OTHER COMPANIES FOLLOWING A DECLINE IN THE MARKET PRICE OF THEIR SECURITIES. IF OUR STOCK PRICE IS VOLATILE, WE MAY BECOME INVOLVED IN THIS TYPE OF LITIGATION IN THE FUTURE. ANY LITIGATION COULD RESULT IN SUBSTANTIAL COSTS AND A DIVERSION OF MANAGEMENT’S ATTENTION AND RESOURCES THAT ARE NEEDED TO SUCCESSFULLY RUN OUR BUSINESS.

THE FOLLOWING IS A SUMMARY OF PRINCIPAL PROPERTIES OWNED OR LEASED BY NIKE.

THE NIKE WORLD CAMPUS, OWNED BY NIKE

AND LOCATED NEAR BEAVERTON, OREGON, USA, IS A 270-ACRE FACILITY OF 38 BUILDINGS WHICH, TOGETHER WITH ADJACENT LEASED PROPERTIES, FUNCTIONS AS OUR WORLD HEADQUARTERS AND IS OCCUPIED BY MORE THAN 8,500 E

MPLOYEES ENGAGED IN MANAGEMENT, RESEARCH, DESIGN, DEVELOPMENT, MARKETING, FINANCE, AND OTHER ADMINISTRATIVE FUNCTIONS SERVING NEARLY ALL OF OUR DIVISIONS. WE ALSO LEASE VARIOUS OFFICE FACILITIES IN THE SURROUNDING METROPOLITAN AREA. WE LEASE A SIMILAR, BUT SMALLER, ADMINISTRATIVE FACILITY IN HILVERSUM, THE NETHERLANDS, WHICH SERVES AS THE HEADQUARTERS FOR THE WESTERN EUROPE AND CENTRAL & EASTERN EUROPE GEOGRAPHIES, AND MANAGES CERTAIN BRAND MANAGEMENT FUNCTIONS FOR OUR NON-U.S. OPERATIONS. WE ALSO LEASE AN OFFICE COMPLEX IN SHANGHAI, CHINA, OUR HEADQUARTERS FOR GREATER CHINA, OCCUPIED BY EMPLOYEES FOCUSED ON IMPLEMENTING OUR WHOLESALE, DTC AND MERCHANDISING STRATEGIES IN THE REGION, AMONG OTHER FUNCTIONS. IN THE UNITED STATES, THERE ARE FIVE SIGNIFICANT DISTRIBUTION CENTERS IN MEMPHIS, TENNESSEE; TWO ARE OWNED AND THREE ARE LEASED. NIKE BRAND APPAREL AND EQUIPMENT ARE ALSO SHIPPED FROM OUR FOOTHILL RANCH, CALIFORNIA DISTRIBUTION CENTER, WHICH WE LEASE. SMALLER LEASED DISTRIBUTION FACILITIES FOR NON-NIKE BRAND BUSINESSES ARE LOCATED IN VARIOUS PARTS OF THE UNITED STATES. WE ALSO OWN OR LEASE DISTRIBUTION AND CUSTOMER SERVICE FACILITIES OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES. THE MOST SIGNIFICANT ARE THE DISTRIBUTION FACILITIES LOCATED IN LAAKDAL, BELGIUM; TAICANG, CHINA; AND TOMISATO, JAPAN; ALL OF WHICH WE OWN.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

NIKE DESIGNS, DEVELOPS, MARKETS, AND SELLS ATHLETIC FOOTWEAR, APPAREL, EQUIPMENT, ACCESSORIES, AND SERVICES WORLDWIDE. WE ARE THE LARGEST SELLER OF ATHLETIC FOOTWEAR AND APPAREL IN THE WORLD. WE SELL OUR PRODUCTS TO RETAIL ACCOUNTS, AS WELL AS THROUGH NIKE-OWNED IN-LINE AND FACTORY RETAIL STORES AND NIKE-OWNED INTERNET WEBSITES (WHICH WE REFER TO AS OUR “DIRECT TO CONSUMER” OR "DTC" OPERATIONS), AND THROUGH A MIX OF INDEPENDENT DISTRIBUTORS, LICENSEES, AND SALES REPRESENTATIVES IN VIRTUALLY ALL COUNTRIES AROUND THE WORLD. OUR GOAL IS TO DELIVER VALUE TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS BY BUILDING A PROFITABLE GLOBAL PORTFOLIO OF BRANDED FOOTWEAR, APPAREL, EQUIPMENT, AND ACCESSORIES BUSINESSES. OUR STRATEGY IS TO ACHIEVE LONG-TERM REVENUE GROWTH BY CREATING INNOVATIVE, “MUST HAVE” PRODUCTS, BUILDING DEEP PERSONAL CONSUMER CONNECTIONS WITH OUR BRANDS, AND DELIVERING COMPELLING CONSUMER EXPERIENCES AT RETAIL AND ONLINE.

IN ADDITION TO ACHIEVING LONG-TERM, SUSTAINABLE REVENUE GROWTH, WE CONTINUE TO STRIVE TO DELIVER SHAREHOLDER VALUE BY DRIVING OPERATIONAL EXCELLENCE IN SEVERAL KEY AREAS.

•

EXPANDING GROSS MARGIN BY.

-

DELIVERING INNOVATIVE, PREMIUM PRODUCTS THAT COMMAND HIGHER PRICES WHILE MAINTAINING A STRONG CONSUMER PRICE-TO-VALUE PROPOSITION;

-

REDUCING PRODUCT COSTS THROUGH A CONTINUED FOCUS ON MANUFACTURING EFFICIENCY, PRODUCT DESIGN, AND INNOVATION; AND

-

MAKING OUR SUPPLY CHAIN A COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE.

•

IMPROVING SELLING AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE PRODUCTIVITY BY FOCUSING ON INVESTMENTS THAT DRIVE ECONOMIC RETURNS IN THE FORM OF INCREMENTAL REVENUE AND GROSS PROFIT, AND LEVERAGING EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE ACROSS OUR PORTFOLIO OF BUSINESSES TO ELIMINATE DUPLICATIVE COSTS;

•

IMPROVING WORKING CAPITAL EFFICIENCY; AND

•

DEPLOYING CAPITAL EFFECTIVELY.

THROUGH EXECUTION OF THIS STRATEGY, OUR LONG-TERM FINANCIAL GOALS CONTINUE TO BE.

•

HIGH SINGLE-DIGIT REVENUE GROWTH,

•

MID-TEENS EARNINGS PER SHARE GROWTH,

•

CONSISTENT RETURN ON INVESTED CAPITAL AND ACCELERATED CASH FLOWS, AND

•

STEADY RESULTS THROUGH EFFECTIVE MANAGEMENT OF OUR DIVERSIFIED PORTFOLIO OF BUSINESSES.

OVER THE PAST TEN YEARS, WE HAVE ACHIEVED MANY OF THESE FINANCIAL GOALS. DURING THIS TIME, REVENUES AND DILUTED EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE FOR NIKE, INC., INCLUSIVE OF BOTH CONTINUING AND DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS, HAVE GROWN 9% AND 13%, RESPECTIVELY, ON AN ANNUAL COMPOUNDED BASIS. OUR RETURN ON INVESTED CAPITAL HAS INCREASED FROM 22% TO 25% AND WE EXPANDED GROSS MARGINS BY APPROXIMATELY 190 BASIS POINTS.

ON NOVEMBER 15, 2012, WE ANNOUNCED A TWO-FOR-ONE STOCK SPLIT OF BOTH CLASS A AND CLASS B COMMON SHARES. THE STOCK SPLIT WAS IN THE FORM OF A 100 PERCENT STOCK DIVIDEND PAYABLE ON DECEMBER 24, 2012 TO SHAREHOLDERS OF RECORD AT THE CLOSE OF BUSINESS DECEMBER 10, 2012. COMMON STOCK BEGAN TRADING AT THE SPLIT-ADJUSTED PRICE ON DECEMBER 26, 2012. ALL SHARE NUMBERS AND PER SHARE AMOUNTS PRESENTED REFLECT THE STOCK SPLIT.

OUR FISCAL 2014 RESULTS FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS DEMONSTRATED THE POWER OF THE NIKE, INC. PORTFOLIO TO DELIVER CONSISTENT GROWTH IN REVENUES, EARNINGS, AND CASH RETURNS TO SHAREHOLDERS, WHILE INVESTING FOR LONG-TERM GROWTH. DESPITE SIGNIFICANT FOREIGN CURRENCY HEADWINDS, WE DELIVERED RECORD REVENUES AND EARNINGS PER SHARE IN FISCAL 2014. OUR REVENUES GREW 10% TO $27.8 BILLION, NET INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS INCREASED 10% TO $2.7 BILLION, AND WE DELIVERED DILUTED EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE OF $2.97, AN 11% INCREASE FROM FISCAL 2013.

EARNINGS BEFORE INTEREST AND INCOME TAXES ("EBIT") FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS INCREASED 10% FOR FISCAL 2014, DRIVEN BY REVENUE GROWTH AND IMPROVED GROSS MARGIN, WHICH MORE THAN OFFSET HIGHER SELLING AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE. THE INCREASE IN REVENUES WAS DRIVEN BY GROWTH ACROSS NEARLY ALL NIKE

BRAND GEOGRAPHIES, KEY CATEGORIES, AND PRODUCT TYPES. THIS GROWTH WAS PRIMARILY FUELED BY.

•

INNOVATIVE PERFORMANCE AND SPORTSWEAR PRODUCTS, INCORPORATING PROPRIETARY TECHNOLOGY PLATFORMS SUCH AS NIKE AIR, LUNAR, SHOX, FREE, FLYWIRE, DRI-FIT, FLYKNIT, NIKE+, AND NIKE FUEL;

•

DEEP BRAND CONNECTIONS TO CONSUMERS THROUGH A CATEGORY LENS, REINFORCED BY INVESTMENTS IN ENDORSEMENTS BY HIGH-PROFILE ATHLETES AND TEAMS, HIGH-IMPACT MARKETING AROUND GLOBAL SPORTING EVENTS (SUCH AS THE WORLD CUP, OLYMPICS, AND NFL SUPER BOWL) AND DIGITAL MARKETING; AND

•

STRONG CATEGORY RETAIL PRESENTATION ONLINE AND AT NIKE-OWNED AND RETAIL PARTNER STORES.

WE ALSO DELIVERED STRONG RESULTS FOR CONVERSE, WITH REVENUE AND EBIT GROWTH OF 16% AND 17%, RESPECTIVELY.

OUR GROSS MARGINS IMPROVED LARGELY DUE TO THE POSITIVE IMPACT OF HIGHER AVERAGE SELLING PRICES AND CONTRIBUTION FROM OUR HIGHER MARGIN DTC BUSINESS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER PRODUCT INPUT COSTS, DUE PRIMARILY TO LABOR COST INFLATION IN OUR PRODUCT COSTS, AND FOREIGN CURRENCY HEADWINDS.

FOR FISCAL 2014, THE GROWTH OF OUR NET INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS WAS POSITIVELY AFFECTED BY A YEAR-OVER-YEAR DECREASE IN OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE. IN ADDITION, DILUTED EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE GREW AT A HIGHER RATE THAN NET INCOME DUE TO A 1% DECREASE IN THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE NUMBER OF DILUTED COMMON SHARES OUTSTANDING AS A RESULT OF SHARE REPURCHASES.

DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2013, WE COMPLETED THE SALE OF CERTAIN ASSETS OF THE UMBRO BRAND AND RECORDED A LOSS ON THE SALE OF THESE ASSETS OF $107 MILLION, NET OF TAX. DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2013, WE COMPLETED THE SALE OF COLE HAAN AND RECORDED A GAIN ON SALE OF $231 MILLION, NET OF TAX. AS OF MAY 31, 2013, THE COMPANY HAD SUBSTANTIALLY COMPLETED ALL TRANSITION SERVICES RELATED TO THE SALE OF BOTH BUSINESSES. UNLESS OTHERWISE INDICATED, THE FOLLOWING DISCLOSURES REFLECT THE COMPANY'S CONTINUING OPERATIONS; REFER TO OUR “DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS" SECTION FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING OUR DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS.

WHILE MACROECONOMIC UNCERTAINTIES IN THE GLOBAL ECONOMY ARE LIKELY TO PERSIST, WE CONTINUE TO SEE OPPORTUNITIES TO DRIVE FUTURE GROWTH AND REMAIN COMMITTED TO EFFECTIVELY MANAGING OUR BUSINESS TO ACHIEVE OUR FINANCIAL GOALS OVER THE LONG TERM BY EXECUTING AGAINST THE OPERATIONAL STRATEGIES OUTLINED ABOVE.

FISCAL 2014 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2013

ON A CURRENCY NEUTRAL BASIS, REVENUES FROM NIKE, INC. CONTINUING OPERATIONS GREW 11% FOR FISCAL 2014, DRIVEN BY INCREASES IN REVENUES FOR BOTH THE NIKE BRAND AND CONVERSE. EVERY NIKE BRAND GEOGRAPHY DELIVERED HIGHER REVENUES FOR FISCAL 2014. NORTH AMERICA CONTRIBUTED 5 PERCENTAGE POINTS OF THE INCREASE IN NIKE, INC. REVENUES, WHILE WESTERN EUROPE AND EMERGING MARKETS EACH CONTRIBUTED 2 PERCENTAGE POINTS AND CENTRAL & EASTERN EUROPE AND CONVERSE EACH CONTRIBUTED 1 PERCENTAGE POINT.

ON A CURRENCY NEUTRAL BASIS, NIKE BRAND FOOTWEAR AND APPAREL REVENUES INCREASED 12% AND 10%, RESPECTIVELY, WHILE NIKE BRAND EQUIPMENT REVENUES INCREASED 4% DURING FISCAL 2014. THE INCREASE IN NIKE BRAND FOOTWEAR REVENUES FOR FISCAL 2014 WAS MAINLY DUE TO GROWTH IN OUR BASKETBALL, SPORTSWEAR, RUNNING, AND FOOTBALL (SOCCER) CATEGORIES. THE GROWTH OF NIKE FOOTWEAR REVENUES CONTINUED TO BE FUELED BY INCREASED DEMAND FOR PERFORMANCE PRODUCTS, INCLUDING NIKE AND BRAND JORDAN BASKETBALL STYLES; RUNNING MODELS WITH NIKE FREE, AIR MAX, LUNAR, AND FLYKNIT TECHNOLOGIES; AND PERFORMANCE FOOTBALL (SOCCER) PRODUCTS. FOOTWEAR UNIT SALES IN FISCAL 2014 INCREASED APPROXIMATELY 7% AND THE AVERAGE SELLING PRICE PER PAIR INCREASED APPROXIMATELY 5%, DRIVEN NEARLY EQUALLY BY PRICE INCREASES AND A SHIFT IN MIX TO HIGHER PRICED PRODUCTS.

FOR NIKE BRAND APPAREL, THE INCREASE IN REVENUES FOR FISCAL 2014 WAS DRIVEN BY GROWTH IN ALL KEY CATEGORIES, MOST NOTABLY OUR FOOTBALL (SOCCER), RUNNING, AND WOMEN'S TRAINING CATEGORIES. IN FISCAL 2014, UNIT SALES OF APPAREL INCREASED APPROXIMATELY 6% AND THE AVERAGE SELLING PRICE PER UNIT INCREASED APPROXIMATELY 4%, DRIVEN BY PRICE INCREASES, AND TO A LESSER EXTENT, A SHIFT IN MIX TO HIGHER PRICED PRODUCTS.

WHILE WHOLESALE REVENUES REMAIN THE LARGEST COMPONENT OF OVERALL NIKE BRAND REVENUES, WE CONTINUE TO EXPAND OUR DTC BUSINESSES IN EACH OF OUR GEOGRAPHIES. OUR NIKE BRAND DTC OPERATIONS INCLUDE NIKE-OWNED IN-LINE AND FACTORY STORES, AS WELL AS ONLINE SALES THROUGH NIKE-OWNED WEBSITES. FOR FISCAL 2014, DTC REVENUES REPRESENTED APPROXIMATELY 20% OF OUR TOTAL NIKE BRAND REVENUES COMPARED TO 18% IN FISCAL 2013. ON A CURRENCY NEUTRAL BASIS, DTC REVENUES GREW 22% FOR FISCAL 2014, AS COMPARABLE STORE SALES GREW 10% AND WE CONTINUED TO OPEN NEW STORES AND EXPAND OUR E-COMMERCE BUSINESS. COMPARABLE STORE SALES INCLUDE REVENUES FROM NIKE-OWNED IN-LINE AND FACTORY STORES FOR WHICH ALL THREE OF THE FOLLOWING REQUIREMENTS HAVE BEEN MET: (1) THE STORE HAS BEEN OPEN AT LEAST ONE YEAR, (2) SQUARE FOOTAGE HAS NOT CHANGED BY MORE THAN 15% WITHIN THE PAST YEAR, AND (3) THE STORE HAS NOT BEEN PERMANENTLY REPOSITIONED WITHIN THE PAST YEAR. ONLINE SALES THROUGH NIKE-OWNED WEBSITES, WHICH ARE NOT INCLUDED IN COMPARABLE STORE SALES, GREW 42% IN FISCAL 2014. ONLINE SALES REPRESENTED APPROXIMATELY 15% OF OUR TOTAL NIKE BRAND DTC REVENUES FOR FISCAL 2014, COMPARED TO 12% FOR FISCAL 2013.

ON A WHOLESALE EQUIVALENT BASIS AND EXCLUDING THE EFFECTS OF CHANGES IN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES, FISCAL 2014 NIKE BRAND MEN'S REVENUES INCREASED 9% MAINLY AS A RESULT OF STRONG GROWTH IN OUR BASKETBALL, FOOTBALL (SOCCER), RUNNING, AND SPORTSWEAR CATEGORIES. WOMEN'S REVENUES INCREASED 12% IN LARGE PART DUE TO INCREASES IN OUR RUNNING, SPORTSWEAR, AND WOMEN'S TRAINING CATEGORIES. THE 16% INCREASE IN THE YOUNG ATHLETES' BUSINESS WAS DRIVEN BY INCREASES IN THE BASKETBALL AND FOOTBALL (SOCCER) CATEGORIES IN PART DUE TO OUR EXPANDED FOOTWEAR AND APPAREL OFFERINGS FOR THIS AGE GROUP.

FISCAL 2013 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2012

ON A CURRENCY NEUTRAL BASIS, REVENUES FROM OUR NIKE, INC. CONTINUING OPERATIONS GREW 11% FOR FISCAL 2013, DRIVEN BY INCREASES IN REVENUES FOR BOTH THE NIKE BRAND AND CONVERSE. EVERY NIKE BRAND GEOGRAPHY EXCEPT GREATER CHINA DELIVERED HIGHER REVENUES FOR FISCAL 2013. NORTH AMERICA CONTRIBUTED 7 PERCENTAGE POINTS OF THE INCREASE IN NIKE, INC. REVENUES, WHILE EMERGING MARKETS CONTRIBUTED 2 PERCENTAGE POINTS AND WESTERN AND CENTRAL & EASTERN EUROPE EACH CONTRIBUTED 1 PERCENTAGE POINT. GREATER CHINA

'

S RESULTS REDUCED NIKE, INC. REVENUE GROWTH BY 1 PERCENTAGE POINT. REVENUES FOR CONVERSE CONTRIBUTED 1 PERCENTAGE POINT TO OUR CONSOLIDATED REVENUE GROWTH.

EXCLUDING THE EFFECTS OF CHANGES IN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES, NIKE BRAND FOOTWEAR AND APPAREL REVENUES INCREASED 11% AND 10%, RESPECTIVELY, WHILE NIKE BRAND EQUIPMENT REVENUES INCREASED 17% DURING FISCAL 2013. THE INCREASE IN NIKE BRAND FOOTWEAR REVENUES FOR FISCAL 2013 WAS ATTRIBUTABLE TO GROWTH ACROSS OUR RUNNING, BASKETBALL, FOOTBALL (SOCCER), AND SPORTSWEAR CATEGORIES. THE GROWTH OF NIKE FOOTWEAR REVENUES CONTINUED TO BE FUELED BY INCREASED DEMAND FOR PERFORMANCE PRODUCTS, INCLUDING RUNNING MODELS WITH NIKE FREE AND LUNAR TECHNOLOGIES, NIKE AND BRAND JORDAN BASKETBALL STYLES, AND PERFORMANCE FOOTBALL (SOCCER) PRODUCTS. IN FISCAL 2013, UNIT SALES OF FOOTWEAR INCREASED APPROXIMATELY 7% AND THE AVERAGE SELLING PRICE PER PAIR INCREASED APPROXIMATELY 4%, DRIVEN EQUALLY BY PRICE INCREASES AND A SHIFT IN MIX TO HIGHER PRICED PRODUCTS.

FOR NIKE BRAND APPAREL, THE INCREASE IN REVENUES FOR FISCAL 2013 WAS DRIVEN BY OUR MEN

'

S TRAINING CATEGORY (WHICH INCLUDES THE NFL LICENSED BUSINESS), IN ADDITION TO STRONG DEMAND FOR RUNNING AND BASKETBALL PRODUCTS. APPAREL UNIT SALES IN FISCAL 2013 INCREASED APPROXIMATELY 7% AND THE AVERAGE SELLING PRICE PER UNIT INCREASED APPROXIMATELY 3%, REFLECTING A FAVORABLE MIX OF HIGHER PRICED PRODUCTS, SUCH AS PERFORMANCE RUNNING, BASKETBALL, AND NFL LICENSED APPAREL; AND TO A LESSER EXTENT, HIGHER SELLING PRICES.

FOR FISCAL 2013, DTC CHANNELS REPRESENTED APPROXIMATELY 18% OF OVERALL NIKE BRAND REVENUES COMPARED TO 16% IN FISCAL 2012.  ON A CURRENCY NEUTRAL BASIS, DTC REVENUES GREW 24% FOR FISCAL 2013, AS COMPARABLE STORE SALES GREW 14% AND WE CONTINUED TO EXPAND OUR STORE NETWORK AND E-COMMERCE BUSINESSES.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

ON A WHOLESALE EQUIVALENT AND CURRENCY NEUTRAL BASIS, FISCAL 2013 NIKE BRAND MEN'S REVENUES INCREASED 9% DUE PRIMARILY TO GROWTH IN OUR RUNNING, MEN'S TRAINING, AND BASKETBALL CATEGORIES. WOMEN'S REVENUES INCREASED 9% DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY AN INCREASE IN RUNNING AND WOMEN'S TRAINING. THE 11% INCREASE IN THE YOUNG ATHLETES' BUSINESS WAS DUE PRIMARILY TO INCREASES IN BASKETBALL.

FUTURES ORDERS

FUTURES ORDERS FOR NIKE BRAND FOOTWEAR AND APPAREL SCHEDULED FOR DELIVERY FROM JUNE THROUGH NOVEMBER 2014 WERE 11% HIGHER THAN THE ORDERS REPORTED FOR THE COMPARABLE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD. THE U.S.

DOLLAR FUTURES ORDER AMOUNT IS CALCULATED BASED UPON OUR INTERNAL FORECAST OF THE CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES UNDER WHICH OUR REVENUES WILL BE TRANSLATED DURING THIS PERIOD.

EXCLUDING THE IMPACT OF CURRENCY CHANGES, FUTURES ORDERS INCREASED 12%, WITH UNIT ORDERS AND AVERAGE SELLING PRICE PER UNIT CONTRIBUTING APPROXIMATELY 8 AND 4 PERCENTAGE POINTS OF GROWTH, RESPECTIVELY.

THE REPORTED FUTURES ORDERS GROWTH IS NOT NECESSARILY INDICATIVE OF OUR EXPECTATION OF REVENUE GROWTH DURING THIS PERIOD. THIS IS DUE TO YEAR-OVER-YEAR CHANGES IN SHIPMENT TIMING, CHANGES IN THE MIX OF ORDERS BETWEEN FUTURES AND AT-ONCE ORDERS, AND THE FULFILLMENT OF CERTAIN ORDERS MAY FALL OUTSIDE OF THE SCHEDULE NOTED ABOVE. IN ADDITION, EXCHANGE RATE FLUCTUATIONS AS WELL AS DIFFERING LEVELS OF ORDER CANCELLATIONS, DISCOUNTS, AND RETURNS CAN CAUSE DIFFERENCES IN THE COMPARISONS BETWEEN FUTURES ORDERS AND ACTUAL REVENUES. MOREOVER, A PORTION OF OUR REVENUE IS NOT DERIVED FROM FUTURES ORDERS, INCLUDING SALES OF AT-ONCE AND CLOSEOUT NIKE BRAND FOOTWEAR AND APPAREL, NIKE BRAND EQUIPMENT, DTC OPERATION SALES, AND SALES FROM CONVERSE, NIKE GOLF, AND HURLEY.

FISCAL 2014 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2013

FOR FISCAL 2014, OUR CONSOLIDATED GROSS MARGIN WAS 120 BASIS POINTS HIGHER THAN FISCAL 2013, PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY HIGHER NIKE BRAND AVERAGE SELLING PRICES (INCREASING GROSS MARGIN APPROXIMATELY 160 BASIS POINTS), ATTRIBUTABLE TO BOTH PRICE INCREASES AND A SHIFT IN MIX TO HIGHER PRICED PRODUCTS. GROSS MARGIN WAS ALSO POSITIVELY IMPACTED BY GROWTH IN OUR HIGHER MARGIN DTC BUSINESS (INCREASING GROSS MARGIN APPROXIMATELY 40 BASIS POINTS) AND IMPROVED MARGINS DUE TO CLEANER CLOSEOUT INVENTORIES (INCREASING MARGIN APPROXIMATELY 20 BASIS POINTS). THESE INCREASES IN GROSS MARGIN WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER PRODUCT COSTS (DECREASING GROSS MARGIN APPROXIMATELY 50 BASIS POINTS), PRIMARILY DUE TO A SHIFT IN MIX TO HIGHER COST PRODUCTS, AS WELL AS PRODUCT LABOR INPUT COST INFLATION. GROSS MARGINS WERE ALSO NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY UNFAVORABLE FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE MOVEMENTS (DECREASING GROSS MARGIN APPROXIMATELY 50 BASIS POINTS).

FISCAL 2013 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2012

FOR FISCAL 2013, OUR CONSOLIDATED GROSS MARGIN WAS 10 BASIS POINTS HIGHER THAN FISCAL 2012, PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY HIGHER AVERAGE SELLING PRICES (APPROXIMATELY 160 BASIS POINTS) THAT WERE ATTRIBUTABLE TO HIGHER PRICES AND A FAVORABLE SALES MIX. THE POSITIVE BENEFIT OF HIGHER NET AVERAGE SELLING PRICES WAS LARGELY OFFSET BY HIGHER PRODUCT COSTS (APPROXIMATELY 110 BASIS POINTS), PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER FACTORY LABOR COSTS, AND UNFAVORABLE FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE MOVEMENTS (APPROXIMATELY 40 BASIS POINTS).

IN ADDITION, IN FISCAL 2013 WE EXPERIENCED SIGNIFICANT SHIFTS IN THE MIX OF REVENUES FROM HIGHER TO LOWER MARGIN SEGMENTS OF OUR BUSINESS. WHILE GROWTH IN THESE LOWER GROSS MARGIN SEGMENTS DELIVERED INCREMENTAL REVENUE AND PROFITS, IT HAD A NEGATIVE EFFECT ON OUR CONSOLIDATED GROSS MARGIN.

FISCAL 2014 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2013

THE 70 BASIS POINT DECREASE IN OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR THE FISCAL YEAR WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY AN INCREASE IN EARNINGS IN LOWER TAX JURISDICTIONS.  DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED MAY 31, 2014, WE REACHED A RESOLUTION WITH THE IRS ON AN ADVANCED PRICING AGREEMENT.  THIS AGREEMENT DID NOT HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR FISCAL 2014.

FISCAL 2013 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2012

THE 30 BASIS POINT DECREASE IN OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR THE FISCAL YEAR WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY THE U.S. LEGISLATIVE RETROACTIVE REINSTATEMENT OF THE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT TAX CREDIT AND A REDUCTION OF TAX RESERVES ON FOREIGN OPERATIONS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN THE PERCENTAGE OF EARNINGS IN HIGHER TAX JURISDICTIONS.

DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS

DURING FISCAL 2013, WE DIVESTED OF UMBRO AND COLE HAAN, ALLOWING US TO FOCUS OUR RESOURCES ON DRIVING GROWTH IN THE NIKE, JORDAN, CONVERSE, AND HURLEY BRANDS.  THE RESULTS OF THE DIVESTITURE ARE PRESENTED AS DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS.  PLEASE REFER TO NOTE 15 — DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS IN THE ACCOMPANYING NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR MORE DETAIL.

OPERATING SEGMENTS

OUR REPORTABLE OPERATING SEGMENTS ARE EVIDENCE OF THE STRUCTURE OF THE COMPANY'S INTERNAL ORGANIZATION, WHICH CHANGED BEGINNING IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2014. THE NIKE BRAND SEGMENTS CONTINUE TO BE DEFINED BY GEOGRAPHIC REGIONS FOR OPERATIONS PARTICIPATING IN NIKE BRAND SALES ACTIVITY, WHICH NOW INCLUDES THE RESULTS OF NIKE GOLF AND HURLEY. PREVIOUSLY, NIKE GOLF AND HURLEY WERE COMBINED WITH CONVERSE AND REPORTED AS "OTHER BUSINESSES."

EACH NIKE BRAND GEOGRAPHIC SEGMENT OPERATES PREDOMINANTLY IN ONE INDUSTRY: THE DESIGN, DEVELOPMENT, MARKETING, AND SELLING OF ATHLETIC FOOTWEAR, APPAREL, AND EQUIPMENT. THE COMPANY’S REPORTABLE OPERATING SEGMENTS FOR THE NIKE BRAND ARE: NORTH AMERICA, WESTERN EUROPE, CENTRAL & EASTERN EUROPE, GREATER CHINA, JAPAN, AND EMERGING MARKETS. THE COMPANY’S NIKE BRAND DTC OPERATIONS ARE MANAGED WITHIN EACH GEOGRAPHIC SEGMENT. CONVERSE IS ALSO A REPORTABLE SEGMENT FOR NIKE, INC., AND OPERATES IN ONE INDUSTRY: THE DESIGN, MARKETING, LICENSING, AND SELLING OF CASUAL SNEAKERS, APPAREL, AND ACCESSORIES. PRIOR YEAR AMOUNTS HAVE BEEN RESTATED TO CONFORM TO FISCAL 2014 PRESENTATION.

AS PART OF OUR CENTRALLY MANAGED FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK MANAGEMENT PROGRAM, STANDARD FOREIGN CURRENCY RATES ARE ASSIGNED TWICE PER YEAR TO EACH NIKE BRAND ENTITY IN OUR GEOGRAPHIC OPERATING SEGMENTS AND CONVERSE. THESE RATES ARE SET APPROXIMATELY NINE MONTHS IN ADVANCE OF THE FUTURE SELLING SEASON BASED ON AVERAGE MARKET SPOT RATES IN THE CALENDAR MONTH PRECEDING THE DATE THEY ARE ESTABLISHED. INVENTORIES AND COST OF SALES FOR GEOGRAPHIC OPERATING SEGMENTS AND CONVERSE REFLECT THE USE OF THESE STANDARD RATES TO RECORD NON-FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY PRODUCT PURCHASES INTO THE ENTITY’S FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY. DIFFERENCES BETWEEN ASSIGNED STANDARD FOREIGN CURRENCY RATES AND ACTUAL MARKET RATES ARE INCLUDED IN CORPORATE TOGETHER WITH FOREIGN CURRENCY HEDGE GAINS AND LOSSES GENERATED FROM OUR CENTRALLY MANAGED FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK MANAGEMENT PROGRAM.

IN TERRITORIES WE DEFINE AS "DIRECT DISTRIBUTION MARKETS," CONVERSE DESIGNS, MARKETS, AND SELLS PRODUCTS DIRECTLY TO DISTRIBUTORS, WHOLESALE CUSTOMERS, AND TO CONSUMERS THROUGH DTC OPERATIONS. THE LARGEST DIRECT DISTRIBUTION MARKETS ARE THE UNITED STATES, THE UNITED KINGDOM, AND CHINA. CONVERSE DOES NOT OWN THE CONVERSE TRADEMARKS IN JAPAN. TERRITORIES OTHER THAN DIRECT DISTRIBUTION MARKETS AND JAPAN ARE SERVICED BY THIRD-PARTY LICENSEES WHO PAY ROYALTY REVENUES TO CONVERSE FOR THE USE OF ITS REGISTERED TRADEMARKS AND OTHER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS.

FISCAL 2014 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2013

EXCLUDING CHANGES IN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES, REVENUES FOR CONVERSE INCREASED 15% FOR FISCAL 2014. REVENUE GROWTH IN DIRECT DISTRIBUTION MARKETS, WHICH REPRESENT APPROXIMATELY 84% OF CONVERSE REVENUES, CONTRIBUTED 16 PERCENTAGE POINTS TO THE TOTAL INCREASE FOR FISCAL 2014, WHILE LICENSING REVENUES DECREASED OVERALL REVENUE BY 1 PERCENTAGE POINT. REVENUES FROM OUR DIRECT DISTRIBUTION MARKETS GREW 19% FOR FISCAL 2014 DRIVEN BY GROWTH IN "COMPARABLE" DIRECT DISTRIBUTION MARKETS (I.E., MARKETS SERVED UNDER A DIRECT DISTRIBUTION MODEL FOR COMPARABLE PERIODS IN THE CURRENT AND PRIOR FISCAL YEARS), PRIMARILY THE UNITED STATES, CHINA, AND THE UNITED KINGDOM. COMPARABLE DIRECT DISTRIBUTION MARKETS REVENUES INCREASED 13%, CONTRIBUTING 12 PERCENTAGE POINTS OF DIRECT DISTRIBUTION MARKETS REVENUES GROWTH FOR FISCAL 2014, WHILE CONVERSION OF MARKETS FROM LICENSED TO DIRECT DISTRIBUTION CONTRIBUTED 7 PERCENTAGE POINTS. COMPARABLE DIRECT DISTRIBUTION MARKETS UNIT SALES INCREASED 12% AND AVERAGE SELLING PRICE PER UNIT INCREASED 1% FOR FISCAL 2014. THE INCREASE IN AVERAGE SELLING PRICE PER UNIT RESULTED PRIMARILY FROM A FAVORABLE MIX OF HIGHER PRICED PRODUCT. DUE TO MARKET CONVERSIONS AND BUSINESS DECLINES IN LATIN AMERICA, LICENSING REVENUES DECREASED 3% FOR FISCAL 2014.

ON A REPORTED BASIS, EBIT AT CONVERSE GREW 17% FOR FISCAL 2014 AS HIGHER REVENUES AND GROSS MARGIN WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER SELLING AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE. GROSS MARGIN INCREASED 80 BASIS POINTS, PRIMARILY DUE TO GROWTH IN HIGHER MARGIN TERRITORIES AND PRODUCTS WITHIN OUR DIRECT DISTRIBUTION MARKETS. SELLING AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE GREW FASTER THAN REVENUE FOR FISCAL 2014 DUE TO HIGHER OPERATING OVERHEAD TO SUPPORT GROWTH INITIATIVES AND DTC EXPANSION, AS WELL AS HIGHER DEMAND CREATION SPENDING.

CORPORATE REVENUES PRIMARILY CONSIST OF FOREIGN CURRENCY HEDGE GAINS AND LOSSES RELATED TO REVENUES GENERATED BY ENTITIES WITHIN THE NIKE BRAND GEOGRAPHIC OPERATING SEGMENTS AND CONVERSE BUT MANAGED THROUGH OUR CENTRAL FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK MANAGEMENT PROGRAM.

THE CORPORATE LOSS BEFORE INTEREST AND TAXES CONSISTS LARGELY OF UNALLOCATED GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES, INCLUDING EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH CENTRALLY MANAGED DEPARTMENTS; DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION RELATED TO OUR CORPORATE HEADQUARTERS; UNALLOCATED INSURANCE, BENEFIT, AND COMPENSATION PROGRAMS, INCLUDING STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION; AND CERTAIN FOREIGN CURRENCY GAINS AND LOSSES.

IN ADDITION TO THE FOREIGN CURRENCY GAINS AND LOSSES RECOGNIZED IN CORPORATE REVENUES, FOREIGN CURRENCY RESULTS INCLUDED IN GROSS MARGIN ARE GAINS AND LOSSES RESULTING FROM THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ACTUAL FOREIGN CURRENCY RATES AND STANDARD RATES USED TO RECORD NON-FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY DENOMINATED PRODUCT PURCHASES WITHIN THE NIKE BRAND GEOGRAPHIC OPERATING SEGMENTS AND CONVERSE; RELATED FOREIGN CURRENCY HEDGE RESULTS; CONVERSION GAINS AND LOSSES ARISING FROM RE-MEASUREMENT OF MONETARY ASSETS AND LIABILITIES IN NON-FUNCTIONAL CURRENCIES; AND CERTAIN OTHER FOREIGN CURRENCY HEDGE RESULTS.

FOREIGN CURRENCY EXPOSURES AND HEDGING PRACTICES

OVERVIEW

AS A GLOBAL COMPANY WITH SIGNIFICANT OPERATIONS OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES, IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS WE ARE EXPOSED TO RISK ARISING FROM CHANGES IN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES. OUR PRIMARY FOREIGN CURRENCY EXPOSURES ARISE FROM THE RECORDING OF TRANSACTIONS DENOMINATED IN NON-FUNCTIONAL CURRENCIES AND THE TRANSLATION OF FOREIGN CURRENCY DENOMINATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL POSITION, AND CASH FLOWS INTO U.S. DOLLARS.

OUR FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK MANAGEMENT PROGRAM IS INTENDED TO LESSEN BOTH THE POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE EFFECTS OF CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS ON OUR CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL POSITION, AND CASH FLOWS. WE MANAGE GLOBAL FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK CENTRALLY ON A PORTFOLIO BASIS TO ADDRESS THOSE RISKS THAT ARE MATERIAL TO NIKE, INC. WE MANAGE THESE EXPOSURES BY TAKING ADVANTAGE OF NATURAL OFFSETS AND CURRENCY CORRELATIONS THAT EXIST WITHIN THE PORTFOLIO AND, WHERE PRACTICAL AND MATERIAL, BY HEDGING A PORTION OF THE REMAINING EXPOSURES USING DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS SUCH AS FORWARD CONTRACTS AND OPTIONS. AS DESCRIBED BELOW, THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE NIKE TRADING COMPANY ("NTC") AND OUR FOREIGN CURRENCY ADJUSTMENT PROGRAM ENHANCED OUR ABILITY TO MANAGE OUR FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK BY INCREASING THE NATURAL OFFSETS AND CURRENCY CORRELATION BENEFITS THAT EXIST WITHIN OUR PORTFOLIO OF FOREIGN EXCHANGE EXPOSURES. OUR HEDGING POLICY IS DESIGNED TO PARTIALLY OR ENTIRELY OFFSET THE IMPACT OF EXCHANGE RATE CHANGES ON THE UNDERLYING NET EXPOSURES BEING HEDGED. WHERE EXPOSURES ARE HEDGED, OUR PROGRAM HAS THE EFFECT OF DELAYING THE IMPACT OF EXCHANGE RATE MOVEMENTS ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS; THE LENGTH OF THE DELAY IS DEPENDENT UPON HEDGE HORIZONS. WE DO NOT HOLD OR ISSUE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS FOR TRADING OR SPECULATIVE PURPOSES.

TRANSACTIONAL EXPOSURES

WE CONDUCT BUSINESS IN VARIOUS CURRENCIES AND HAVE TRANSACTIONS WHICH SUBJECT US TO FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK. OUR MOST SIGNIFICANT TRANSACTIONAL FOREIGN CURRENCY EXPOSURES ARE.

•

PRODUCT COSTS — NIKE’S PRODUCT COSTS ARE EXPOSED TO FLUCTUATIONS IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES IN THE FOLLOWING WAYS.

1.

PRODUCT PURCHASES DENOMINATED IN CURRENCIES OTHER THAN THE FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY OF THE TRANSACTING ENTITY.

A.

SOME NIKE ENTITIES PURCHASE PRODUCT FROM THE NTC, A WHOLLY-OWNED SOURCING HUB THAT BUYS NIKE BRANDED PRODUCTS FROM THIRD-PARTY FACTORIES, PREDOMINANTLY IN U.S. DOLLARS. THE NTC, WHOSE FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY IS THE U.S. DOLLAR, THEN SELLS THE PRODUCTS TO NIKE ENTITIES IN THEIR RESPECTIVE FUNCTIONAL CURRENCIES. WHEN THE NTC SELLS TO A NIKE ENTITY WITH A DIFFERENT FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY, THE RESULT IS A FOREIGN CURRENCY EXPOSURE FOR THE NTC.

B.

OTHER NIKE ENTITIES PURCHASE PRODUCT DIRECTLY FROM THIRD-PARTY FACTORIES IN U.S. DOLLARS. THESE PURCHASES GENERATE A FOREIGN CURRENCY EXPOSURE FOR THOSE NIKE ENTITIES WITH A FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY OTHER THAN THE U.S. DOLLAR.

IN BOTH PURCHASING SCENARIOS, A WEAKER U.S. DOLLAR DECREASES THE INVENTORY COST INCURRED BY NIKE WHEREAS A STRONGER U.S. DOLLAR INCREASES ITS COST.

2.

FACTORY INPUT COSTS: IN JANUARY 2012, NIKE IMPLEMENTED A FOREIGN CURRENCY ADJUSTMENT PROGRAM WITH CERTAIN FACTORIES. THE PROGRAM IS DESIGNED TO MORE EFFECTIVELY MANAGE FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK BY ASSUMING CERTAIN OF THE FACTORIES’ FOREIGN CURRENCY EXPOSURES, SOME OF WHICH ARE NATURAL OFFSETS TO OUR EXISTING FOREIGN CURRENCY EXPOSURES. UNDER THIS PROGRAM, OUR PAYMENTS TO THESE FACTORIES ARE ADJUSTED FOR RATE FLUCTUATIONS IN THE BASKET OF CURRENCIES (“FACTORY CURRENCY EXPOSURE INDEX”) IN WHICH THE LABOR, MATERIALS AND OVERHEAD COSTS INCURRED BY THE FACTORIES IN THE PRODUCTION OF NIKE BRANDED PRODUCTS (“FACTORY INPUT COSTS”) ARE DENOMINATED.

32

TABLE OF CONTENTS

FOR THE CURRENCY WITHIN THE FACTORY CURRENCY EXPOSURE INDICES THAT IS THE LOCAL OR FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY OF THE FACTORY, THE CURRENCY RATE FLUCTUATION AFFECTING THE PRODUCT COST IS RECORDED WITHIN INVENTORIES AND IS RECOGNIZED IN COST OF SALES WHEN THE RELATED PRODUCT IS SOLD TO A THIRD-PARTY. ALL CURRENCIES WITHIN THE INDICES, EXCLUDING THE U.S. DOLLAR AND THE LOCAL OR FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY OF THE FACTORY, ARE RECOGNIZED AS EMBEDDED DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS AND ARE RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE THROUGH

OTHER EXPENSE (INCOME), NET

. REFER TO NOTE 17 — RISK MANAGEMENT AND DERIVATIVES IN THE ACCOMPANYING NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR ADDITIONAL DETAIL.

AS AN OFFSET TO THE IMPACTS OF THE FLUCTUATING U.S. DOLLAR ON OUR NON-FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY DENOMINATED PRODUCT PURCHASES DESCRIBED ABOVE, A STRENGTHENING U.S. DOLLAR AGAINST THE FOREIGN CURRENCIES WITHIN THE FACTORY CURRENCY EXPOSURE INDICES DECREASES NIKE’S U.S. DOLLAR INVENTORY COST. CONVERSELY, A WEAKENING U.S. DOLLAR AGAINST THE INDEXED FOREIGN CURRENCIES INCREASES OUR INVENTORY COST.

•

NON-FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY DENOMINATED EXTERNAL SALES — A PORTION OF OUR WESTERN EUROPE AND CENTRAL & EASTERN EUROPE GEOGRAPHY REVENUES ARE EARNED IN CURRENCIES OTHER THAN THE EURO (E.G. BRITISH POUND) BUT ARE RECOGNIZED AT A SUBSIDIARY THAT USES THE EURO AS ITS FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY. THESE SALES GENERATE A FOREIGN CURRENCY EXPOSURE.

•

OTHER COSTS — NON-FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY DENOMINATED COSTS, SUCH AS ENDORSEMENT CONTRACTS, INTERCOMPANY ROYALTIES AND OTHER INTERCOMPANY CHARGES, ALSO GENERATE FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK THOUGH TO A LESSER EXTENT.

•

NON-FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY DENOMINATED MONETARY ASSETS AND LIABILITIES — OUR GLOBAL SUBSIDIARIES HAVE VARIOUS ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, PRIMARILY RECEIVABLES AND PAYABLES, DENOMINATED IN CURRENCIES OTHER THAN THEIR FUNCTIONAL CURRENCIES. THESE BALANCE SHEET ITEMS ARE SUBJECT TO RE-MEASUREMENT, WHICH MAY CREATE FLUCTUATIONS IN

OTHER EXPENSE (INCOME), NET

WITHIN OUR CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

MANAGING TRANSACTIONAL EXPOSURES

TRANSACTIONAL EXPOSURES ARE MANAGED ON A PORTFOLIO BASIS WITHIN OUR FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK MANAGEMENT PROGRAM. WE MANAGE THESE EXPOSURES BY TAKING ADVANTAGE OF NATURAL OFFSETS AND CURRENCY CORRELATIONS THAT EXIST WITHIN THE PORTFOLIO AND MAY ALSO ELECT TO USE CURRENCY FORWARD AND OPTION CONTRACTS TO HEDGE A PORTION OF THE REMAINING EFFECT OF EXCHANGE RATE FLUCTUATIONS ON PROBABLE FORECASTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS, INCLUDING CERTAIN PRODUCT COST PURCHASE EXPOSURES, NON-FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY DENOMINATED EXTERNAL SALES, AND OTHER COSTS DESCRIBED ABOVE. GENERALLY, THESE ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AS CASH FLOW HEDGES IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE ACCOUNTING STANDARDS FOR DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING, EXCEPT FOR HEDGES OF THE EMBEDDED DERIVATIVES COMPONENT OF THE PRODUCT COST EXPOSURES AS DISCUSSED BELOW.

CERTAIN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS USED TO MANAGE THE FOREIGN EXCHANGE EXPOSURE OF NON-FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY DENOMINATED MONETARY ASSETS AND LIABILITIES SUBJECT TO RE-MEASUREMENT AND THE EMBEDDED DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS DISCUSSED ABOVE ARE NOT FORMALLY DESIGNATED AS HEDGING INSTRUMENTS UNDER THE ACCOUNTING STANDARDS FOR DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING. ACCORDINGLY, CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE OF THESE INSTRUMENTS ARE IMMEDIATELY RECOGNIZED IN

OTHER EXPENSE (INCOME), NET

AND ARE INTENDED TO OFFSET THE FOREIGN CURRENCY IMPACT OF THE RE-MEASUREMENT OF THE RELATED NON-FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY DENOMINATED ASSET OR LIABILITY OR THE EMBEDDED DERIVATIVE CONTRACT BEING HEDGED.

REFER TO NOTE 6 — FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS AND NOTE 17 – RISK MANAGEMENT AND DERIVATIVES IN THE ACCOMPANYING NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR ADDITIONAL DESCRIPTION OF HOW THE ABOVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS ARE VALUED AND RECORDED AS WELL AS THE FAIR VALUE OF OUTSTANDING DERIVATIVES AT PERIOD END.

TRANSLATIONAL EXPOSURES

MANY OF OUR FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES OPERATE IN FUNCTIONAL CURRENCIES OTHER THAN THE U.S. DOLLAR. FLUCTUATIONS IN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES CREATE VOLATILITY IN OUR REPORTED RESULTS AS WE ARE REQUIRED TO TRANSLATE THE BALANCE SHEETS, OPERATIONAL RESULTS, AND CASH FLOWS OF THESE SUBSIDIARIES INTO U.S. DOLLARS FOR CONSOLIDATED REPORTING. THE TRANSLATION OF FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES’ NON-U.S. DOLLAR DENOMINATED BALANCE SHEETS INTO U.S. DOLLARS FOR CONSOLIDATED REPORTING RESULTS IN A CUMULATIVE TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENT TO OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME WITHIN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF SHAREHOLDERS’ EQUITY. IN THE TRANSLATION OF OUR CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME, A WEAKER U.S. DOLLAR IN RELATION TO FOREIGN FUNCTIONAL CURRENCIES BENEFITS OUR CONSOLIDATED EARNINGS WHEREAS A STRONGER U.S. DOLLAR REDUCES OUR CONSOLIDATED EARNINGS. THE IMPACT OF FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATE FLUCTUATIONS ON THE TRANSLATION OF OUR CONSOLIDATED REVENUES WAS A DETRIMENT OF APPROXIMATELY $288 MILLION AND $605 MILLION FOR THE YEARS ENDED MAY 31, 2014 AND 2013, RESPECTIVELY. THE IMPACT OF FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATE FLUCTUATIONS ON THE TRANSLATION OF OUR INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES WAS A DETRIMENT OF APPROXIMATELY $49 MILLION AND $104 MILLION FOR THE YEARS ENDED MAY 31, 2014 AND 2013, RESPECTIVELY.

MANAGING TRANSLATIONAL EXPOSURES

TO MINIMIZE THE IMPACT OF TRANSLATING FOREIGN CURRENCY DENOMINATED REVENUES AND EXPENSES INTO U.S. DOLLARS FOR CONSOLIDATED REPORTING, CERTAIN FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES USE EXCESS CASH TO PURCHASE U.S. DOLLAR DENOMINATED AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE INVESTMENTS. THE VARIABLE FUTURE CASH FLOWS ASSOCIATED WITH THE PURCHASE AND SUBSEQUENT SALE OF THESE U.S. DOLLAR DENOMINATED SECURITIES AT NON-U.S. DOLLAR FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY SUBSIDIARIES CREATES A FOREIGN CURRENCY EXPOSURE THAT QUALIFIES FOR HEDGE ACCOUNTING UNDER THE ACCOUNTING STANDARDS FOR DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING. WE UTILIZE FORWARD CONTRACTS AND/OR OPTIONS TO MITIGATE THE VARIABILITY OF THE FORECASTED FUTURE PURCHASES AND SALES OF THESE U.S. DOLLAR INVESTMENTS. THE COMBINATION OF THE PURCHASE AND SALE OF THE U.S. DOLLAR INVESTMENT AND THE HEDGING INSTRUMENT HAS THE EFFECT OF PARTIALLY OFFSETTING THE YEAR-OVER-YEAR FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION IMPACT ON NET EARNINGS IN THE PERIOD THE INVESTMENTS ARE SOLD. HEDGES OF AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE INVESTMENTS ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AS CASH FLOW HEDGES.

REFER TO NOTE 6 — FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS AND NOTE 17 — RISK MANAGEMENT AND DERIVATIVES IN THE ACCOMPANYING NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR ADDITIONAL DESCRIPTION OF HOW THE ABOVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS ARE VALUED AND RECORDED AS WELL AS THE FAIR VALUE OF OUTSTANDING DERIVATIVES AT PERIOD END.

WE ESTIMATE THE COMBINATION OF TRANSLATION OF FOREIGN CURRENCY-DENOMINATED PROFITS FROM OUR INTERNATIONAL BUSINESSES AND THE YEAR-OVER-YEAR CHANGE IN FOREIGN CURRENCY RELATED GAINS AND LOSSES INCLUDED IN

OTHER EXPENSE (INCOME), NET

HAD AN UNFAVORABLE IMPACT OF APPROXIMATELY $139 MILLION AND $56 MILLION ON OUR INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES FOR THE YEARS ENDED MAY 31, 2014 AND 2013, RESPECTIVELY.

NET INVESTMENTS IN FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES

WE ARE ALSO EXPOSED TO THE IMPACT OF FOREIGN EXCHANGE FLUCTUATIONS ON OUR INVESTMENTS IN WHOLLY-OWNED FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES DENOMINATED IN A CURRENCY OTHER THAN THE U.S. DOLLAR, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT THE U.S. DOLLAR VALUE OF THESE INVESTMENTS AND THEREFORE THE VALUE OF FUTURE REPATRIATED EARNINGS. WE HAVE HEDGED AND MAY, IN THE FUTURE, HEDGE NET INVESTMENT POSITIONS IN CERTAIN FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES TO MITIGATE THE EFFECTS OF FOREIGN EXCHANGE FLUCTUATIONS ON THESE NET INVESTMENTS. IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE ACCOUNTING STANDARDS FOR DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING, THE EFFECTIVE PORTION OF THE CHANGE IN FAIR VALUE OF THE FORWARD CONTRACTS DESIGNATED AS NET INVESTMENT HEDGES IS RECORDED IN THE CUMULATIVE TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENT COMPONENT OF ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME. ANY INEFFECTIVE PORTION IS IMMEDIATELY RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS AS A COMPONENT OF

OTHER EXPENSE (INCOME), NET

. THE IMPACT OF INEFFECTIVE HEDGES WAS IMMATERIAL FOR ANY PERIOD PRESENTED. TO MINIMIZE CREDIT RISK, WE HAVE STRUCTURED THESE NET INVESTMENT HEDGES TO BE GENERALLY LESS THAN SIX MONTHS IN DURATION. UPON MATURITY, THE HEDGES ARE SETTLED BASED ON THE CURRENT FAIR VALUE OF THE FORWARD CONTRACTS WITH THE REALIZED GAIN OR LOSS REMAINING IN OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME. THERE WERE NO OUTSTANDING NET INVESTMENT HEDGES AS OF MAY 31, 2014 AND 2013. THERE WERE NO CASH FLOWS FROM NET INVESTMENT HEDGE SETTLEMENTS FOR THE YEARS ENDED MAY 31, 2014 AND 2013.

CAPITAL RESOURCES

ON APRIL 23, 2013, WE FILED A SHELF REGISTRATION STATEMENT (THE "SHELF") WITH THE SEC WHICH PERMITS US TO ISSUE AN UNLIMITED AMOUNT OF DEBT SECURITIES. THE SHELF EXPIRES ON APRIL 23, 2016. ON APRIL 23, 2013, WE ISSUED $1.0 BILLION OF SENIOR NOTES WITH TRANCHES MATURING IN 2023 AND 2043. THE 2023 SENIOR NOTES WERE ISSUED IN AN INITIAL AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF $500 MILLION AT A 2.25% FIXED, ANNUAL INTEREST RATE AND WILL MATURE ON MAY 1, 2023. THE 2043 SENIOR NOTES WERE ISSUED IN AN INITIAL AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF $500 MILLION AT A 3.625% FIXED, ANNUAL INTEREST RATE AND WILL MATURE ON MAY 1, 2043. INTEREST ON THE SENIOR NOTES IS PAYABLE SEMI-ANNUALLY ON MAY 1 AND NOVEMBER 1 OF EACH YEAR. THE ISSUANCE RESULTED IN GROSS PROCEEDS BEFORE EXPENSES OF $998 MILLION.

ON NOVEMBER 1, 2011, WE ENTERED INTO A COMMITTED CREDIT FACILITY AGREEMENT WITH A SYNDICATE OF BANKS WHICH PROVIDES FOR UP TO $1 BILLION OF BORROWINGS WITH THE OPTION TO INCREASE BORROWINGS TO $1.5 BILLION WITH LENDER APPROVAL. FOLLOWING AN EXTENSION AGREEMENT ON SEPTEMBER 17, 2013 BETWEEN THE COMPANY AND THE SYNDICATE OF BANKS, THE FACILITY MATURES NOVEMBER 1, 2017, WITH A ONE-YEAR EXTENSION OPTION EXERCISABLE THROUGH OCTOBER 31, 2014.

NO

AMOUNTS WERE OUTSTANDING UNDER THIS FACILITY AS OF

MAY 31, 2014

OR

2013.

WE CURRENTLY HAVE LONG-TERM DEBT RATINGS OF AA- AND A1 FROM STANDARD AND POOR'S CORPORATION AND MOODY'S INVESTOR SERVICES, RESPECTIVELY. IF OUR LONG-TERM DEBT RATING WERE TO DECLINE, THE FACILITY FEE AND INTEREST RATE UNDER OUR COMMITTED CREDIT FACILITY WOULD INCREASE. CONVERSELY, IF OUR LONG-TERM DEBT RATING WERE TO IMPROVE, THE FACILITY FEE AND INTEREST RATE WOULD DECREASE. CHANGES IN OUR LONG-TERM DEBT RATING WOULD NOT TRIGGER ACCELERATION OF MATURITY OF ANY THEN-OUTSTANDING BORROWINGS OR ANY FUTURE BORROWINGS UNDER THE COMMITTED CREDIT FACILITY. UNDER THIS COMMITTED REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY, WE HAVE AGREED TO VARIOUS COVENANTS. THESE COVENANTS INCLUDE LIMITS ON OUR DISPOSAL OF FIXED ASSETS, THE AMOUNT OF DEBT SECURED BY LIENS WE MAY INCUR, AS WELL AS A MINIMUM CAPITALIZATION RATIO. IN THE EVENT WE WERE TO HAVE ANY BORROWINGS OUTSTANDING UNDER THIS FACILITY AND FAILED TO MEET ANY COVENANT, AND WERE UNABLE TO OBTAIN A WAIVER FROM A MAJORITY OF THE BANKS IN THE SYNDICATE, ANY BORROWINGS WOULD BECOME IMMEDIATELY DUE AND PAYABLE. AS OF

MAY 31, 2014

, WE WERE IN FULL COMPLIANCE WITH EACH OF THESE COVENANTS AND BELIEVE IT IS UNLIKELY WE WILL FAIL TO MEET ANY OF THESE COVENANTS IN THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE.

LIQUIDITY IS ALSO PROVIDED BY OUR $1 BILLION COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAM. DURING THE YEAR ENDED

MAY 31, 2014

, WE DID NOT ISSUE COMMERCIAL PAPER, AND AS OF

MAY 31, 2014

, THERE WERE NO OUTSTANDING BORROWINGS UNDER THIS PROGRAM. WE MAY CONTINUE TO ISSUE COMMERCIAL PAPER OR OTHER DEBT SECURITIES DURING FISCAL 2015 DEPENDING ON GENERAL CORPORATE NEEDS. WE CURRENTLY HAVE SHORT-TERM DEBT RATINGS OF A1+ AND P1 FROM STANDARD AND POOR'S CORPORATION AND MOODY'S INVESTOR SERVICES, RESPECTIVELY.

AS OF

MAY 31, 2014

, WE HAD CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS, AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS TOTALING

$5.1 BILLION

$2.5 BILLION

WAS HELD BY OUR FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES. CASH EQUIVALENTS AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS CONSIST PRIMARILY OF DEPOSITS HELD AT MAJOR BANKS, MONEY MARKET FUNDS, COMMERCIAL PAPER, CORPORATE NOTES, U.S. TREASURY OBLIGATIONS, U.S. GOVERNMENT SPONSORED ENTERPRISE OBLIGATIONS, AND OTHER INVESTMENT GRADE FIXED INCOME SECURITIES. OUR FIXED INCOME INVESTMENTS ARE EXPOSED TO BOTH CREDIT AND INTEREST RATE RISK. ALL OF OUR INVESTMENTS ARE INVESTMENT GRADE TO MINIMIZE OUR CREDIT RISK. WHILE INDIVIDUAL SECURITIES HAVE VARYING DURATIONS, AS OF

MAY 31, 2014

THE AVERAGE DURATION OF OUR SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS AND CASH EQUIVALENTS PORTFOLIO WAS

TABLE OF CONTENTS

TO DATE WE HAVE NOT EXPERIENCED DIFFICULTY ACCESSING THE CREDIT MARKETS OR INCURRED HIGHER INTEREST COSTS. FUTURE VOLATILITY IN THE CAPITAL MARKETS, HOWEVER, MAY INCREASE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH ISSUING COMMERCIAL PAPER OR OTHER DEBT INSTRUMENTS OR AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO ACCESS THOSE MARKETS. WE BELIEVE THAT EXISTING CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS, SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS, AND CASH GENERATED BY OPERATIONS, TOGETHER WITH ACCESS TO EXTERNAL SOURCES OF FUNDS AS DESCRIBED ABOVE, WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO MEET OUR DOMESTIC AND FOREIGN CAPITAL NEEDS IN THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE.

WE UTILIZE A VARIETY OF TAX PLANNING AND FINANCING STRATEGIES TO MANAGE OUR WORLDWIDE CASH AND DEPLOY FUNDS TO LOCATIONS WHERE THEY ARE NEEDED. WE ROUTINELY REPATRIATE A PORTION OF OUR FOREIGN EARNINGS FOR WHICH U.S. TAXES HAVE PREVIOUSLY BEEN PROVIDED. WE ALSO INDEFINITELY REINVEST A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR FOREIGN EARNINGS, AND OUR CURRENT PLANS DO NOT DEMONSTRATE A NEED TO REPATRIATE THESE EARNINGS. SHOULD WE REQUIRE ADDITIONAL CAPITAL IN THE UNITED STATES, WE MAY ELECT TO REPATRIATE INDEFINITELY REINVESTED FOREIGN FUNDS OR RAISE CAPITAL IN THE UNITED STATES THROUGH DEBT. IF WE WERE TO REPATRIATE INDEFINITELY REINVESTED FOREIGN FUNDS, WE WOULD BE REQUIRED TO ACCRUE AND PAY ADDITIONAL U.S. TAXES LESS APPLICABLE FOREIGN TAX CREDITS. IF WE ELECT TO RAISE CAPITAL IN THE UNITED STATES THROUGH DEBT, WE WOULD INCUR ADDITIONAL INTEREST EXPENSE.

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS

IN CONNECTION WITH VARIOUS CONTRACTS AND AGREEMENTS, WE ROUTINELY PROVIDE INDEMNIFICATION RELATING TO THE ENFORCEABILITY OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS, COVERAGE FOR LEGAL ISSUES THAT ARISE AND OTHER ITEMS WHERE WE ARE ACTING AS THE GUARANTOR. CURRENTLY, WE HAVE SEVERAL SUCH AGREEMENTS IN PLACE. HOWEVER, BASED ON OUR HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND THE ESTIMATED PROBABILITY OF FUTURE LOSS, WE HAVE DETERMINED THAT THE FAIR VALUE OF SUCH INDEMNIFICATION IS NOT MATERIAL TO OUR FINANCIAL POSITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

THE AMOUNTS LISTED FOR ENDORSEMENT CONTRACTS REPRESENT APPROXIMATE AMOUNTS OF BASE COMPENSATION AND MINIMUM GUARANTEED ROYALTY FEES WE ARE OBLIGATED TO PAY ATHLETE AND SPORT TEAM ENDORSERS OF OUR PRODUCTS. ACTUAL PAYMENTS UNDER SOME CONTRACTS MAY BE HIGHER THAN THE AMOUNTS LISTED AS THESE CONTRACTS PROVIDE FOR BONUSES TO BE PAID TO THE ENDORSERS BASED UPON ATHLETIC ACHIEVEMENTS AND/OR ROYALTIES ON PRODUCT SALES IN FUTURE PERIODS. ACTUAL PAYMENTS UNDER SOME CONTRACTS MAY ALSO BE LOWER AS THESE CONTRACTS INCLUDE PROVISIONS FOR REDUCED PAYMENTS IF ATHLETIC PERFORMANCE DECLINES IN FUTURE PERIODS.

IN ADDITION TO THE CASH PAYMENTS, WE ARE OBLIGATED TO FURNISH OUR ENDORSERS WITH NIKE PRODUCT FOR THEIR USE. IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO DETERMINE HOW MUCH WE WILL SPEND ON THIS PRODUCT ON AN ANNUAL BASIS AS THE CONTRACTS GENERALLY DO NOT STIPULATE A SPECIFIC AMOUNT OF CASH TO BE SPENT ON THE PRODUCT. THE AMOUNT OF PRODUCT PROVIDED TO THE ENDORSERS WILL DEPEND ON MANY FACTORS, INCLUDING GENERAL PLAYING CONDITIONS, THE NUMBER OF SPORTING EVENTS IN WHICH THEY PARTICIPATE, AND OUR OWN DECISIONS REGARDING PRODUCT AND MARKETING INITIATIVES. IN ADDITION, THE COSTS TO DESIGN, DEVELOP, SOURCE, AND PURCHASE THE PRODUCTS FURNISHED TO THE ENDORSERS ARE INCURRED OVER A PERIOD OF TIME AND ARE NOT NECESSARILY TRACKED SEPARATELY FROM SIMILAR COSTS INCURRED FOR PRODUCTS SOLD TO CUSTOMERS.

WE GENERALLY ORDER PRODUCT AT LEAST FOUR TO FIVE MONTHS IN ADVANCE OF SALE BASED PRIMARILY ON FUTURES ORDERS RECEIVED FROM CUSTOMERS. THE AMOUNTS LISTED FOR PRODUCT PURCHASE OBLIGATIONS REPRESENT AGREEMENTS (INCLUDING OPEN PURCHASE ORDERS) TO PURCHASE PRODUCTS IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS THAT ARE ENFORCEABLE AND LEGALLY BINDING AND THAT SPECIFY ALL SIGNIFICANT TERMS. IN SOME CASES, PRICES ARE SUBJECT TO CHANGE THROUGHOUT THE PRODUCTION PROCESS. THE REPORTED AMOUNTS EXCLUDE PRODUCT PURCHASE LIABILITIES INCLUDED IN ACCOUNTS PAYABLE ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET AS OF

MAY 31, 2014.

OTHER AMOUNTS PRIMARILY INCLUDE SERVICE AND MARKETING COMMITMENTS MADE IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS. THE AMOUNTS REPRESENT THE MINIMUM PAYMENTS REQUIRED BY LEGALLY BINDING CONTRACTS AND AGREEMENTS THAT SPECIFY ALL SIGNIFICANT TERMS, INCLUDING OPEN PURCHASE ORDERS FOR NON-PRODUCT PURCHASES. THE REPORTED AMOUNTS EXCLUDE THOSE LIABILITIES INCLUDED IN ACCOUNTS PAYABLE OR ACCRUED LIABILITIES ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET AS OF

MAY 31, 2014.

RECENTLY ADOPTED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

IN JULY 2013, THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD ("FASB") ISSUED AN ACCOUNTING STANDARDS UPDATE INTENDED TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE ON THE PRESENTATION OF UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS, REFLECTING THE MANNER IN WHICH AN ENTITY WOULD SETTLE, AT THE REPORTING DATE, ANY ADDITIONAL INCOME TAXES THAT WOULD RESULT FROM THE DISALLOWANCE OF A TAX POSITION WHEN NET OPERATING LOSS CARRYFORWARDS, SIMILAR TAX LOSSES, OR TAX CREDIT CARRYFORWARDS EXIST. THIS ACCOUNTING STANDARD IS EFFECTIVE FOR US BEGINNING JUNE 1, 2014 AND EARLY ADOPTION IS PERMITTED. WE EARLY ADOPTED THIS GUIDANCE AND THE ADOPTION DID NOT HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL POSITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

IN JULY 2012, THE FASB ISSUED AN ACCOUNTING STANDARDS UPDATE INTENDED TO SIMPLIFY HOW AN ENTITY TESTS INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS OTHER THAN GOODWILL FOR IMPAIRMENT BY PROVIDING ENTITIES WITH AN OPTION TO PERFORM A QUALITATIVE ASSESSMENT TO DETERMINE WHETHER FURTHER IMPAIRMENT TESTING IS NECESSARY. THIS ACCOUNTING STANDARD UPDATE WAS EFFECTIVE FOR US BEGINNING JUNE 1, 2013. THE ADOPTION OF THIS STANDARD DID NOT HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL POSITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

IN DECEMBER 2011, THE FASB ISSUED GUIDANCE ENHANCING DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS SURROUNDING THE NATURE OF AN ENTITY’S RIGHT TO OFFSET AND RELATED ARRANGEMENTS ASSOCIATED WITH ITS FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS. THIS NEW GUIDANCE REQUIRES COMPANIES TO DISCLOSE BOTH GROSS AND NET INFORMATION ABOUT INSTRUMENTS AND TRANSACTIONS ELIGIBLE FOR OFFSET IN THE STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION AND INSTRUMENTS AND TRANSACTIONS SUBJECT TO MASTER NETTING ARRANGEMENTS. THIS NEW GUIDANCE WAS EFFECTIVE FOR US BEGINNING JUNE 1, 2013. AS THIS GUIDANCE ONLY REQUIRES EXPANDED DISCLOSURES, THE ADOPTION HAD NO IMPACT ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL POSITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

IN MAY 2014, THE FASB ISSUED AN ACCOUNTING STANDARDS UPDATE THAT REPLACES EXISTING REVENUE RECOGNITION GUIDANCE. AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE UPDATED GUIDANCE REQUIRES COMPANIES TO RECOGNIZE REVENUE IN A WAY THAT DEPICTS THE TRANSFER OF PROMISED GOODS OR SERVICES TO CUSTOMERS IN AN AMOUNT THAT REFLECTS THE CONSIDERATION TO WHICH THE ENTITY EXPECTS TO BE ENTITLED IN EXCHANGE FOR THOSE GOODS OR SERVICES. THE NEW GUIDANCE IS EFFECTIVE FOR THE COMPANY BEGINNING JUNE 1, 2017. WE ARE CURRENTLY EVALUATING THE EFFECT THE GUIDANCE WILL HAVE ON THE COMPANY'S CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL POSITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

OUR PREVIOUS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS ARE BASED UPON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, WHICH HAVE BEEN PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. THE PREPARATION OF THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS REQUIRES US TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS THAT AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS, LIABILITIES, REVENUES AND EXPENSES, AND RELATED DISCLOSURE OF CONTINGENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES.

WE BELIEVE THAT THE ESTIMATES, ASSUMPTIONS, AND JUDGMENTS INVOLVED IN THE ACCOUNTING POLICIES DESCRIBED BELOW HAVE THE GREATEST POTENTIAL IMPACT ON OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, SO WE CONSIDER THESE TO BE OUR CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES. BECAUSE OF THE UNCERTAINTY INHERENT IN THESE MATTERS, ACTUAL RESULTS COULD DIFFER FROM THE ESTIMATES WE USE IN APPLYING THE CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES. CERTAIN OF THESE CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AFFECT WORKING CAPITAL ACCOUNT BALANCES, INCLUDING THE POLICIES FOR REVENUE RECOGNITION, THE ALLOWANCE FOR UNCOLLECTIBLE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, INVENTORY RESERVES, AND CONTINGENT PAYMENTS UNDER ENDORSEMENT CONTRACTS. THESE POLICIES REQUIRE THAT WE MAKE ESTIMATES IN THE PREPARATION OF OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AS OF A GIVEN DATE. HOWEVER, SINCE OUR BUSINESS CYCLE IS RELATIVELY SHORT, ACTUAL RESULTS RELATED TO THESE ESTIMATES ARE GENERALLY KNOWN WITHIN THE SIX-MONTH PERIOD FOLLOWING THE FINANCIAL STATEMENT DATE. THUS, THESE POLICIES GENERALLY AFFECT ONLY THE TIMING OF REPORTED AMOUNTS ACROSS TWO TO THREE FISCAL QUARTERS.

WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF THESE CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES, WE ARE NOT CURRENTLY AWARE OF ANY REASONABLY LIKELY EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES THAT WOULD RESULT IN MATERIALLY DIFFERENT AMOUNTS BEING REPORTED.

REVENUE RECOGNITION

WE RECORD WHOLESALE REVENUES WHEN TITLE PASSES AND THE RISKS AND REWARDS OF OWNERSHIP HAVE PASSED TO THE CUSTOMER, BASED ON THE TERMS OF SALE. TITLE PASSES GENERALLY UPON SHIPMENT OR UPON RECEIPT BY THE CUSTOMER DEPENDING ON THE COUNTRY OF THE SALE AND THE AGREEMENT WITH THE CUSTOMER. RETAIL STORE REVENUES ARE RECORDED AT THE TIME OF SALE.

IN SOME INSTANCES, WE SHIP PRODUCT DIRECTLY FROM OUR SUPPLIER TO THE CUSTOMER AND RECOGNIZE REVENUE WHEN THE PRODUCT IS DELIVERED TO AND ACCEPTED BY THE CUSTOMER. OUR REVENUES MAY FLUCTUATE IN CASES WHEN OUR CUSTOMERS DELAY ACCEPTING SHIPMENT OF PRODUCT FOR PERIODS OF UP TO SEVERAL WEEKS.

IN CERTAIN COUNTRIES OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES, PRECISE INFORMATION REGARDING THE DATE OF RECEIPT BY THE CUSTOMER IS NOT READILY AVAILABLE. IN THESE CASES, WE ESTIMATE THE DATE OF RECEIPT BY THE CUSTOMER BASED UPON HISTORICAL DELIVERY TIMES BY GEOGRAPHIC LOCATION. ON THE BASIS OF OUR TESTS OF ACTUAL TRANSACTIONS, WE HAVE NO INDICATION THAT THESE ESTIMATES HAVE BEEN MATERIALLY INACCURATE HISTORICALLY.

AS PART OF OUR REVENUE RECOGNITION POLICY, WE RECORD ESTIMATED SALES RETURNS, DISCOUNTS, AND MISCELLANEOUS CLAIMS FROM CUSTOMERS AS REDUCTIONS TO REVENUES AT THE TIME REVENUES ARE RECORDED. OUR POST INVOICE SALES DISCOUNTS CONSIST OF CONTRACTUAL PROGRAMS WITH CERTAIN CUSTOMERS OR DISCRETIONARY DISCOUNTS THAT ARE EXPECTED TO BE GRANTED TO CERTAIN CUSTOMERS AT A LATER DATE. WE BASE OUR ESTIMATES ON HISTORICAL RATES OF PRODUCT RETURNS, DISCOUNTS AND CLAIMS, SPECIFIC IDENTIFICATION OF OUTSTANDING CLAIMS AND OUTSTANDING RETURNS NOT YET RECEIVED FROM CUSTOMERS, AND ESTIMATED RETURNS, DISCOUNTS, AND CLAIMS EXPECTED BUT NOT YET FINALIZED WITH OUR CUSTOMERS. ACTUAL RETURNS, DISCOUNTS, AND CLAIMS IN ANY FUTURE PERIOD ARE INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN AND THUS MAY DIFFER FROM OUR ESTIMATES. IF ACTUAL OR EXPECTED FUTURE RETURNS, DISCOUNTS, AND CLAIMS WERE SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER OR LOWER THAN THE RESERVES WE HAD ESTABLISHED, WE WOULD RECORD A REDUCTION OR INCREASE TO NET REVENUES IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH WE MADE SUCH DETERMINATION.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

ALLOWANCE FOR UNCOLLECTIBLE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE

WE MAKE ONGOING ESTIMATES RELATING TO THE ABILITY TO COLLECT OUR ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND MAINTAIN AN ALLOWANCE FOR ESTIMATED LOSSES RESULTING FROM THE INABILITY OF OUR CUSTOMERS TO MAKE REQUIRED PAYMENTS. IN DETERMINING THE AMOUNT OF THE ALLOWANCE, WE CONSIDER OUR HISTORICAL LEVEL OF CREDIT LOSSES AND MAKE JUDGMENTS ABOUT THE CREDITWORTHINESS OF SIGNIFICANT CUSTOMERS BASED ON ONGOING CREDIT EVALUATIONS. SINCE WE CANNOT PREDICT FUTURE CHANGES IN THE FINANCIAL STABILITY OF OUR CUSTOMERS, ACTUAL FUTURE LOSSES FROM UNCOLLECTIBLE ACCOUNTS MAY DIFFER FROM OUR ESTIMATES. IF THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF OUR CUSTOMERS WERE TO DETERIORATE, RESULTING IN THEIR INABILITY TO MAKE PAYMENTS, A LARGER ALLOWANCE MIGHT BE REQUIRED. IN THE EVENT WE DETERMINE THAT A SMALLER OR LARGER ALLOWANCE IS APPROPRIATE, WE WOULD RECORD A CREDIT OR A CHARGE TO OPERATING OVERHEAD EXPENSE IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH SUCH A DETERMINATION IS MADE.

INVENTORY RESERVES

WE ALSO MAKE ONGOING ESTIMATES RELATING TO THE NET REALIZABLE VALUE OF INVENTORIES BASED UPON OUR ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT FUTURE DEMAND AND MARKET CONDITIONS. IF WE ESTIMATE THAT THE NET REALIZABLE VALUE OF OUR INVENTORY IS LESS THAN THE COST OF THE INVENTORY RECORDED ON OUR BOOKS, WE RECORD A RESERVE EQUAL TO THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE COST OF THE INVENTORY AND THE ESTIMATED NET REALIZABLE VALUE. THIS RESERVE IS RECORDED AS A CHARGE TO COST OF SALES. IF CHANGES IN MARKET CONDITIONS RESULT IN REDUCTIONS IN THE ESTIMATED NET REALIZABLE VALUE OF OUR INVENTORY BELOW OUR PREVIOUS ESTIMATE, WE WOULD INCREASE OUR RESERVE IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH WE MADE SUCH A DETERMINATION AND RECORD A CHARGE TO COST OF SALES.

CONTINGENT PAYMENTS UNDER ENDORSEMENT CONTRACTS

A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR DEMAND CREATION EXPENSE RELATES TO PAYMENTS UNDER ENDORSEMENT CONTRACTS. IN GENERAL, ENDORSEMENT PAYMENTS ARE EXPENSED UNIFORMLY OVER THE TERM OF THE CONTRACT. HOWEVER, CERTAIN CONTRACT ELEMENTS MAY BE ACCOUNTED FOR DIFFERENTLY, BASED UPON THE FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES OF EACH INDIVIDUAL CONTRACT.

CERTAIN CONTRACTS PROVIDE FOR CONTINGENT PAYMENTS TO ENDORSERS BASED UPON SPECIFIC ACHIEVEMENTS IN THEIR SPORTS (E.G., WINNING A CHAMPIONSHIP). WE RECORD DEMAND CREATION EXPENSE FOR THESE AMOUNTS WHEN THE ENDORSER ACHIEVES THE SPECIFIC GOAL.

CERTAIN CONTRACTS PROVIDE FOR VARIABLE PAYMENTS BASED UPON ENDORSERS MAINTAINING A LEVEL OF PERFORMANCE IN THEIR SPORT OVER AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF TIME (E.G., MAINTAINING A SPECIFIED RANKING IN A SPORT FOR A YEAR). THESE AMOUNTS ARE REPORTED IN DEMAND CREATION EXPENSE WHEN WE DETERMINE THAT IT IS PROBABLE THAT THE SPECIFIED LEVEL OF PERFORMANCE WILL BE MAINTAINED THROUGHOUT THE PERIOD. IN THESE INSTANCES, TO THE EXTENT THAT ACTUAL PAYMENTS TO THE ENDORSER DIFFER FROM OUR ESTIMATE DUE TO CHANGES IN THE ENDORSER’S PERFORMANCE, INCREASED OR DECREASED DEMAND CREATION EXPENSE MAY BE REPORTED IN A FUTURE PERIOD.

CERTAIN CONTRACTS PROVIDE FOR ROYALTY PAYMENTS TO ENDORSERS BASED UPON A PREDETERMINED PERCENTAGE OF SALES OF PARTICULAR PRODUCTS. WE EXPENSE THESE PAYMENTS IN COST OF SALES AS THE RELATED SALES OCCUR. IN CERTAIN CONTRACTS, WE OFFER MINIMUM GUARANTEED ROYALTY PAYMENTS. FOR CONTRACTS FOR WHICH WE ESTIMATE WE WILL NOT MEET THE MINIMUM GUARANTEED AMOUNT OF ROYALTY FEES THROUGH SALES OF PRODUCT, WE RECORD THE AMOUNT OF THE GUARANTEED PAYMENT IN EXCESS OF THAT EARNED THROUGH SALES OF PRODUCT IN DEMAND CREATION EXPENSE UNIFORMLY OVER THE REMAINING GUARANTEE PERIOD.

PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT AND DEFINITE-LIVED ASSETS

PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT, INCLUDING BUILDINGS, EQUIPMENT, AND COMPUTER HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE ARE RECORDED AT COST (INCLUDING, IN SOME CASES, THE COST OF INTERNAL LABOR) AND ARE DEPRECIATED OVER THE ESTIMATED USEFUL LIFE. CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES (SUCH AS TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES OR CHANGES TO OUR BUSINESS OPERATIONS) CAN RESULT IN DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE ACTUAL AND ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES. IN THOSE CASES WHERE WE DETERMINE THAT THE USEFUL LIFE OF A LONG-LIVED ASSET SHOULD BE SHORTENED, WE INCREASE DEPRECIATION EXPENSE OVER THE REMAINING USEFUL LIFE TO DEPRECIATE THE ASSET’S NET BOOK VALUE TO ITS SALVAGE VALUE.

WE REVIEW THE CARRYING VALUE OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS OR ASSET GROUPS TO BE USED IN OPERATIONS WHENEVER EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THAT THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF THE ASSETS MIGHT NOT BE RECOVERABLE. FACTORS THAT WOULD NECESSITATE AN IMPAIRMENT ASSESSMENT INCLUDE A SIGNIFICANT ADVERSE CHANGE IN THE EXTENT OR MANNER IN WHICH AN ASSET IS USED, A SIGNIFICANT ADVERSE CHANGE IN LEGAL FACTORS OR THE BUSINESS CLIMATE THAT COULD AFFECT THE VALUE OF THE ASSET, OR A SIGNIFICANT DECLINE IN THE OBSERVABLE MARKET VALUE OF AN ASSET, AMONG OTHERS. IF SUCH FACTS INDICATE A POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT, WE WOULD ASSESS THE RECOVERABILITY OF AN ASSET GROUP BY DETERMINING IF THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE ASSET GROUP EXCEEDS THE SUM OF THE PROJECTED UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS EXPECTED TO RESULT FROM THE USE AND EVENTUAL DISPOSITION OF THE ASSETS OVER THE REMAINING ECONOMIC LIFE OF THE PRIMARY ASSET IN THE ASSET GROUP. IF THE RECOVERABILITY TEST INDICATES THAT THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE ASSET GROUP IS NOT RECOVERABLE, WE WILL ESTIMATE THE FAIR VALUE OF THE ASSET GROUP USING APPROPRIATE VALUATION METHODOLOGIES THAT WOULD TYPICALLY INCLUDE AN ESTIMATE OF DISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS. ANY IMPAIRMENT WOULD BE MEASURED AS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE ASSET GROUP’S CARRYING AMOUNT AND ITS ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE.

GOODWILL AND INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS

WE PERFORM ANNUAL IMPAIRMENT TESTS ON GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS WITH INDEFINITE LIVES IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF EACH FISCAL YEAR, OR WHEN EVENTS OCCUR OR CIRCUMSTANCES CHANGE THAT WOULD, MORE LIKELY THAN NOT, REDUCE THE FAIR VALUE OF A REPORTING UNIT OR AN INTANGIBLE ASSET WITH AN INDEFINITE LIFE BELOW ITS CARRYING VALUE. EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES THAT MAY TRIGGER INTERIM IMPAIRMENT REVIEWS INCLUDE SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN BUSINESS CLIMATE, OPERATING RESULTS, PLANNED INVESTMENTS IN THE REPORTING UNIT, PLANNED DIVESTITURES, OR AN EXPECTATION THAT THE CARRYING AMOUNT MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE, AMONG OTHER FACTORS. WE MAY FIRST ASSESS QUALITATIVE FACTORS TO DETERMINE WHETHER IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT THE FAIR VALUE OF A REPORTING UNIT IS LESS THAN ITS CARRYING AMOUNT. IF, AFTER ASSESSING THE TOTALITY OF EVENTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES, WE DETERMINE THAT IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT THE FAIR VALUE OF THE REPORTING UNIT IS GREATER THAN ITS CARRYING AMOUNT, THE TWO-STEP IMPAIRMENT TEST IS UNNECESSARY. THE TWO-STEP IMPAIRMENT TEST REQUIRES US TO ESTIMATE THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR REPORTING UNITS. IF THE CARRYING VALUE OF A REPORTING UNIT EXCEEDS ITS FAIR VALUE, THE GOODWILL OF THAT REPORTING UNIT IS POTENTIALLY IMPAIRED AND WE PROCEED TO STEP TWO OF THE IMPAIRMENT ANALYSIS. IN STEP TWO OF THE ANALYSIS, WE MEASURE AND RECORD AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS EQUAL TO THE EXCESS OF THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE REPORTING UNIT'S GOODWILL OVER ITS IMPLIED FAIR VALUE, IF ANY.

37

TABLE OF CONTENTS

WE GENERALLY BASE OUR MEASUREMENT OF THE FAIR VALUE OF A REPORTING UNIT ON A BLENDED ANALYSIS OF THE PRESENT VALUE OF FUTURE DISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS AND THE MARKET VALUATION APPROACH. THE DISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS MODEL INDICATES THE FAIR VALUE OF THE REPORTING UNIT BASED ON THE PRESENT VALUE OF THE CASH FLOWS THAT WE EXPECT THE REPORTING UNIT TO GENERATE IN THE FUTURE. OUR SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES IN THE DISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS MODEL INCLUDE: OUR WEIGHTED AVERAGE COST OF CAPITAL; LONG-TERM RATE OF GROWTH AND PROFITABILITY OF THE REPORTING UNIT'S BUSINESS; AND WORKING CAPITAL EFFECTS. THE MARKET VALUATION APPROACH INDICATES THE FAIR VALUE OF THE BUSINESS BASED ON A COMPARISON OF THE REPORTING UNIT TO COMPARABLE PUBLICLY TRADED COMPANIES IN SIMILAR LINES OF BUSINESS. SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES IN THE MARKET VALUATION APPROACH MODEL INCLUDE IDENTIFYING SIMILAR COMPANIES WITH COMPARABLE BUSINESS FACTORS SUCH AS SIZE, GROWTH, PROFITABILITY, RISK, AND RETURN ON INVESTMENT, AND ASSESSING COMPARABLE REVENUE AND OPERATING INCOME MULTIPLES IN ESTIMATING THE FAIR VALUE OF THE REPORTING UNIT.

INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS PRIMARILY CONSIST OF ACQUIRED TRADE NAMES AND TRADEMARKS. WE MAY FIRST PERFORM A QUALITATIVE ASSESSMENT TO DETERMINE WHETHER IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT AN INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSET IS IMPAIRED. IF, AFTER ASSESSING THE TOTALITY OF EVENTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES, WE DETERMINE THAT IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT THE INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSET IS NOT IMPAIRED, NO QUANTITATIVE FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT IS NECESSARY. IF A QUANTITATIVE FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT CALCULATION IS REQUIRED FOR THESE INTANGIBLE ASSETS, WE UTILIZE THE RELIEF-FROM-ROYALTY METHOD. THIS METHOD ASSUMES THAT TRADE NAMES AND TRADEMARKS HAVE VALUE TO THE EXTENT THAT THEIR OWNER IS RELIEVED OF THE OBLIGATION TO PAY ROYALTIES FOR THE BENEFITS RECEIVED FROM THEM. THIS METHOD REQUIRES US TO ESTIMATE THE FUTURE REVENUE FOR THE RELATED BRANDS, THE APPROPRIATE ROYALTY RATE, AND THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE COST OF CAPITAL.

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

FOR FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE ON A RECURRING BASIS, FAIR VALUE IS THE PRICE WE WOULD RECEIVE TO SELL AN ASSET OR PAY TO TRANSFER A LIABILITY IN AN ORDERLY TRANSACTION WITH A MARKET PARTICIPANT AT THE MEASUREMENT DATE. IN GENERAL, AND WHERE APPLICABLE, WE USE QUOTED PRICES IN ACTIVE MARKETS FOR IDENTICAL ASSETS OR LIABILITIES TO DETERMINE THE FAIR VALUES OF OUR FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS. THIS PRICING METHODOLOGY APPLIES TO OUR LEVEL 1 INVESTMENTS, INCLUDING U.S. TREASURY SECURITIES.

IN THE ABSENCE OF ACTIVE MARKETS FOR IDENTICAL ASSETS OR LIABILITIES, SUCH MEASUREMENTS INVOLVE DEVELOPING ASSUMPTIONS BASED ON MARKET OBSERVABLE DATA, INCLUDING QUOTED PRICES FOR SIMILAR ASSETS OR LIABILITIES IN ACTIVE MARKETS AND QUOTED PRICES FOR IDENTICAL OR SIMILAR ASSETS OR LIABILITIES IN MARKETS THAT ARE NOT ACTIVE. THIS PRICING METHODOLOGY APPLIES TO OUR LEVEL 2 INVESTMENTS SUCH AS COMMERCIAL PAPER AND BONDS, U.S. AGENCY SECURITIES, AND MONEY MARKET FUNDS.

LEVEL 3 INVESTMENTS ARE VALUED USING INTERNALLY DEVELOPED MODELS WITH UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS. ASSETS AND LIABILITIES MEASURED USING UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS ARE AN IMMATERIAL PORTION OF OUR PORTFOLIO.

A MAJORITY OF OUR AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE SECURITIES ARE PRICED BY PRICING VENDORS AND ARE GENERALLY LEVEL 1 OR LEVEL 2 INVESTMENTS AS THESE VENDORS EITHER PROVIDE A QUOTED MARKET PRICE IN AN ACTIVE MARKET OR USE OBSERVABLE INPUTS WITHOUT APPLYING SIGNIFICANT ADJUSTMENTS IN THEIR PRICING. OBSERVABLE INPUTS INCLUDE BROKER QUOTES, INTEREST RATES AND YIELD CURVES OBSERVABLE AT COMMONLY QUOTED INTERVALS, VOLATILITIES, AND CREDIT RISKS. OUR FAIR VALUE PROCESSES INCLUDE CONTROLS THAT ARE DESIGNED TO ENSURE APPROPRIATE FAIR VALUES ARE RECORDED. THESE CONTROLS INCLUDE AN ANALYSIS OF PERIOD-OVER-PERIOD FLUCTUATIONS AND COMPARISON TO ANOTHER INDEPENDENT PRICING VENDOR.

HEDGE ACCOUNTING FOR DERIVATIVES

WE USE FORWARD AND OPTION CONTRACTS TO HEDGE CERTAIN ANTICIPATED FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE TRANSACTIONS AS WELL AS CERTAIN NON-FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY MONETARY ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. WHEN THE SPECIFIC CRITERIA TO QUALIFY FOR HEDGE ACCOUNTING HAS BEEN MET, CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF CONTRACTS HEDGING PROBABLE FORECASTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS ARE RECORDED IN OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME, RATHER THAN NET INCOME, UNTIL THE UNDERLYING HEDGED TRANSACTION AFFECTS NET INCOME. IN MOST CASES, THIS RESULTS IN GAINS AND LOSSES ON HEDGE DERIVATIVES BEING RELEASED FROM OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME INTO NET INCOME SOMETIME AFTER THE MATURITY OF THE DERIVATIVE. ONE OF THE CRITERIA FOR THIS ACCOUNTING TREATMENT IS THAT THE NOTIONAL VALUE OF FORWARD AND OPTION CONTRACTS SHOULD NOT BE IN EXCESS OF SPECIFICALLY IDENTIFIED ANTICIPATED TRANSACTIONS. BY THEIR VERY NATURE, OUR ESTIMATES OF ANTICIPATED TRANSACTIONS MAY FLUCTUATE OVER TIME AND MAY ULTIMATELY VARY FROM ACTUAL TRANSACTIONS. WHEN ANTICIPATED TRANSACTION ESTIMATES OR ACTUAL TRANSACTION AMOUNTS DECLINE BELOW HEDGED LEVELS, OR IF IT IS NO LONGER PROBABLE THAT A FORECASTED TRANSACTION WILL OCCUR BY THE END OF THE ORIGINALLY SPECIFIED TIME PERIOD OR WITHIN AN ADDITIONAL TWO-MONTH PERIOD OF TIME THEREAFTER, WE ARE REQUIRED TO RECLASSIFY THE CUMULATIVE CHANGE IN FAIR VALUE OF THE OVER-HEDGED PORTION OF THE RELATED HEDGE CONTRACT FROM OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME TO

OTHER EXPENSE (INCOME), NET

DURING THE QUARTER IN WHICH THE DECREASE OCCURS.

WE HAVE USED AND MAY IN THE FUTURE USE, FORWARD CONTRACTS OR OPTIONS TO HEDGE OUR INVESTMENT IN THE NET ASSETS OF CERTAIN INTERNATIONAL SUBSIDIARIES TO OFFSET FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION RELATED TO OUR NET INVESTMENT IN THOSE SUBSIDIARIES. THE CHANGE IN FAIR VALUE OF THE FORWARD CONTRACTS OR OPTIONS HEDGING OUR NET INVESTMENTS IS REPORTED IN THE CUMULATIVE TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENT COMPONENT OF ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME WITHIN TOTAL SHAREHOLDERS’ EQUITY, TO THE EXTENT EFFECTIVE, TO OFFSET THE FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENTS ON THOSE INVESTMENTS. AS THE VALUE OF OUR UNDERLYING NET INVESTMENTS IN WHOLLY-OWNED INTERNATIONAL SUBSIDIARIES IS KNOWN AT THE TIME A HEDGE IS PLACED, THE DESIGNATED HEDGE IS MATCHED TO THE PORTION OF OUR NET INVESTMENT AT RISK. ACCORDINGLY, THE VARIABILITY INVOLVED IN NET INVESTMENT HEDGES IS SUBSTANTIALLY LESS THAN THAT OF OTHER TYPES OF HEDGE TRANSACTIONS AND WE DO NOT EXPECT ANY MATERIAL INEFFECTIVENESS. WE CONSIDER, ON A QUARTERLY BASIS, THE NEED TO REDESIGNATE EXISTING HEDGE RELATIONSHIPS BASED ON CHANGES IN THE UNDERLYING NET INVESTMENT. SHOULD THE LEVEL OF OUR NET INVESTMENT DECREASE BELOW HEDGED LEVELS, THE CUMULATIVE CHANGE IN FAIR VALUE OF THE OVER-HEDGED PORTION OF THE RELATED HEDGE CONTRACT WOULD BE REPORTED AS

OTHER EXPENSE (INCOME), NET

DURING THE PERIOD IN WHICH CHANGES OCCUR.

STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION

WE ACCOUNT FOR STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION BY ESTIMATING THE FAIR VALUE OF STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION ON THE DATE OF GRANT USING THE BLACK-SCHOLES OPTION PRICING MODEL. THE BLACK-SCHOLES OPTION PRICING MODEL REQUIRES THE INPUT OF HIGHLY SUBJECTIVE ASSUMPTIONS INCLUDING VOLATILITY. EXPECTED VOLATILITY IS ESTIMATED BASED ON IMPLIED VOLATILITY IN MARKET TRADED OPTIONS ON OUR COMMON STOCK WITH A TERM GREATER THAN ONE YEAR, ALONG WITH OTHER FACTORS. OUR DECISION TO USE IMPLIED VOLATILITY WAS BASED ON THE AVAILABILITY OF ACTIVELY TRADED OPTIONS ON OUR COMMON STOCK AND OUR ASSESSMENT THAT IMPLIED VOLATILITY IS MORE REPRESENTATIVE OF FUTURE STOCK PRICE TRENDS THAN HISTORICAL VOLATILITY. IF FACTORS CHANGE AND WE USE DIFFERENT ASSUMPTIONS FOR ESTIMATING STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE IN FUTURE PERIODS, STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE MAY DIFFER MATERIALLY IN THE FUTURE FROM THAT RECORDED IN THE CURRENT PERIOD.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

INCOME TAXES

WE RECORD VALUATION ALLOWANCES AGAINST OUR DEFERRED TAX ASSETS, WHEN NECESSARY. REALIZATION OF DEFERRED TAX ASSETS (SUCH AS NET OPERATING LOSS CARRY-FORWARDS) IS DEPENDENT ON FUTURE TAXABLE EARNINGS AND IS THEREFORE UNCERTAIN. AT LEAST QUARTERLY, WE ASSESS THE LIKELIHOOD THAT OUR DEFERRED TAX ASSET BALANCE WILL BE RECOVERED FROM FUTURE TAXABLE INCOME. TO THE EXTENT WE BELIEVE THAT RECOVERY IS NOT LIKELY, WE ESTABLISH A VALUATION ALLOWANCE AGAINST OUR NET DEFERRED TAX ASSET, WHICH INCREASES OUR INCOME TAX EXPENSE IN THE PERIOD WHEN SUCH DETERMINATION IS MADE.

IN ADDITION, WE HAVE NOT RECORDED U.S. INCOME TAX EXPENSE FOR FOREIGN EARNINGS THAT WE HAVE DETERMINED TO BE INDEFINITELY REINVESTED OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES, THUS REDUCING OUR OVERALL INCOME TAX EXPENSE. THE AMOUNT OF EARNINGS DESIGNATED AS INDEFINITELY REINVESTED OFFSHORE IS BASED UPON THE ACTUAL DEPLOYMENT OF SUCH EARNINGS IN OUR OFFSHORE ASSETS AND OUR EXPECTATIONS OF THE FUTURE CASH NEEDS OF OUR U.S. AND FOREIGN ENTITIES. INCOME TAX CONSIDERATIONS ARE ALSO A FACTOR IN DETERMINING THE AMOUNT OF FOREIGN EARNINGS TO BE INDEFINITELY REINVESTED OFFSHORE.

WE CAREFULLY REVIEW ALL FACTORS THAT DRIVE THE ULTIMATE DISPOSITION OF FOREIGN EARNINGS DETERMINED TO BE REINVESTED OFFSHORE AND APPLY STRINGENT STANDARDS TO OVERCOME THE PRESUMPTION OF REPATRIATION. DESPITE THIS APPROACH, BECAUSE THE DETERMINATION INVOLVES OUR FUTURE PLANS AND EXPECTATIONS OF FUTURE EVENTS, THE POSSIBILITY EXISTS THAT AMOUNTS DECLARED AS INDEFINITELY REINVESTED OFFSHORE MAY ULTIMATELY BE REPATRIATED. FOR INSTANCE, THE ACTUAL CASH NEEDS OF OUR U.S. ENTITIES MAY EXCEED OUR CURRENT EXPECTATIONS, OR THE ACTUAL CASH NEEDS OF OUR FOREIGN ENTITIES MAY BE LESS THAN OUR CURRENT EXPECTATIONS. THIS WOULD RESULT IN ADDITIONAL INCOME TAX EXPENSE IN THE YEAR WE DETERMINED THAT AMOUNTS WERE NO LONGER INDEFINITELY REINVESTED OFFSHORE. CONVERSELY, OUR APPROACH MAY ALSO RESULT IN A DETERMINATION THAT ACCUMULATED FOREIGN EARNINGS (FOR WHICH U.S. INCOME TAXES HAVE BEEN PROVIDED) WILL BE INDEFINITELY REINVESTED OFFSHORE. IN THIS CASE, OUR INCOME TAX EXPENSE WOULD BE REDUCED IN THE YEAR OF SUCH DETERMINATION.

ON AN INTERIM BASIS, WE ESTIMATE WHAT OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE WILL BE FOR THE FULL FISCAL YEAR. THIS ESTIMATED ANNUAL EFFECTIVE TAX RATE IS THEN APPLIED TO THE YEAR-TO-DATE INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES EXCLUDING INFREQUENTLY OCCURRING OR UNUSUAL ITEMS, TO DETERMINE THE YEAR-TO-DATE INCOME TAX EXPENSE. THE INCOME TAX EFFECTS OF INFREQUENT OR UNUSUAL ITEMS ARE RECOGNIZED IN THE INTERIM PERIOD IN WHICH THEY OCCUR. AS THE FISCAL YEAR PROGRESSES, WE CONTINUALLY REFINE OUR ESTIMATE BASED UPON ACTUAL EVENTS AND EARNINGS BY JURISDICTION DURING THE YEAR. THIS CONTINUAL ESTIMATION PROCESS PERIODICALLY RESULTS IN A CHANGE TO OUR EXPECTED EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR THE FISCAL YEAR. WHEN THIS OCCURS, WE ADJUST THE INCOME TAX PROVISION DURING THE QUARTER IN WHICH THE CHANGE IN ESTIMATE OCCURS.

ON A QUARTERLY BASIS, WE EVALUATE THE PROBABILITY THAT A TAX POSITION WILL BE EFFECTIVELY SUSTAINED AND THE APPROPRIATENESS OF THE AMOUNT RECOGNIZED FOR UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS BASED ON FACTORS INCLUDING CHANGES IN FACTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES, CHANGES IN TAX LAW, SETTLED AUDIT ISSUES, AND NEW AUDIT ACTIVITY. CHANGES IN OUR ASSESSMENT MAY RESULT IN THE RECOGNITION OF A TAX BENEFIT OR AN ADDITIONAL CHARGE TO THE TAX PROVISION IN THE PERIOD OUR ASSESSMENT CHANGES. WE RECOGNIZE INTEREST AND PENALTIES RELATED TO INCOME TAX MATTERS IN INCOME TAX EXPENSE.

OTHER CONTINGENCIES

IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS, WE ARE INVOLVED IN LEGAL PROCEEDINGS REGARDING CONTRACTUAL AND EMPLOYMENT RELATIONSHIPS, PRODUCT LIABILITY CLAIMS, TRADEMARK RIGHTS, AND A VARIETY OF OTHER MATTERS. WE RECORD CONTINGENT LIABILITIES RESULTING FROM CLAIMS AGAINST US, INCLUDING RELATED LEGAL COSTS, WHEN A LOSS IS ASSESSED TO BE PROBABLE AND THE AMOUNT OF THE LOSS IS REASONABLY ESTIMABLE. ASSESSING PROBABILITY OF LOSS AND ESTIMATING PROBABLE LOSSES REQUIRES ANALYSIS OF MULTIPLE FACTORS, INCLUDING IN SOME CASES JUDGMENTS ABOUT THE POTENTIAL ACTIONS OF THIRD-PARTY CLAIMANTS AND COURTS. RECORDED CONTINGENT LIABILITIES ARE BASED ON THE BEST INFORMATION AVAILABLE AND ACTUAL LOSSES IN ANY FUTURE PERIOD ARE INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN. IF FUTURE ADJUSTMENTS TO ESTIMATED PROBABLE FUTURE LOSSES OR ACTUAL LOSSES EXCEED OUR RECORDED LIABILITY FOR SUCH CLAIMS, WE WOULD RECORD ADDITIONAL CHARGES AS

OTHER EXPENSE (INCOME), NET

DURING THE PERIOD IN WHICH THE ACTUAL LOSS OR CHANGE IN ESTIMATE OCCURRED. IN ADDITION TO CONTINGENT LIABILITIES RECORDED FOR PROBABLE LOSSES, WE DISCLOSE CONTINGENT LIABILITIES WHEN THERE IS A REASONABLE POSSIBILITY THAT THE ULTIMATE LOSS WILL MATERIALLY EXCEED THE RECORDED LIABILITY. WHILE WE CANNOT PREDICT THE OUTCOME OF PENDING LEGAL MATTERS WITH CERTAINTY, WE DO NOT BELIEVE ANY CURRENTLY IDENTIFIED CLAIM, PROCEEDING, OR LITIGATION, EITHER INDIVIDUALLY OR IN AGGREGATE, WILL HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL POSITION, OR CASH FLOWS.

ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS AND CONSISTENT WITH ESTABLISHED POLICIES AND PROCEDURES, WE EMPLOY A VARIETY OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS TO MANAGE EXPOSURE TO FLUCTUATIONS IN THE VALUE OF FOREIGN CURRENCIES AND INTEREST RATES. IT IS OUR POLICY TO UTILIZE THESE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS ONLY WHERE NECESSARY TO FINANCE OUR BUSINESS AND MANAGE SUCH EXPOSURES; WE DO NOT ENTER INTO THESE TRANSACTIONS FOR TRADING OR SPECULATIVE PURPOSES.

WE ARE EXPOSED TO FOREIGN CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS, PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF OUR INTERNATIONAL SALES, PRODUCT SOURCING, AND FUNDING ACTIVITIES. OUR FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK MANAGEMENT PROGRAM IS INTENDED TO LESSEN BOTH THE POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE EFFECTS OF CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS ON OUR CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL POSITION, AND CASH FLOWS. WE USE FORWARD EXCHANGE CONTRACTS AND OPTIONS TO HEDGE CERTAIN ANTICIPATED BUT NOT YET FIRMLY COMMITTED TRANSACTIONS AS WELL AS CERTAIN FIRM COMMITMENTS AND THE RELATED RECEIVABLES AND PAYABLES, INCLUDING THIRD-PARTY AND INTERCOMPANY TRANSACTIONS. WE HAVE, AND MAY IN THE FUTURE, ALSO USE FORWARD CONTRACTS OR OPTIONS TO HEDGE OUR INVESTMENT IN THE NET ASSETS OF CERTAIN INTERNATIONAL SUBSIDIARIES TO OFFSET FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENTS RELATED TO OUR NET INVESTMENT IN THOSE SUBSIDIARIES. WHERE EXPOSURES ARE HEDGED, OUR PROGRAM HAS THE EFFECT OF DELAYING THE IMPACT OF EXCHANGE RATE MOVEMENTS ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

THE TIMING FOR HEDGING EXPOSURES, AS WELL AS THE TYPE AND DURATION OF THE HEDGE INSTRUMENTS EMPLOYED, ARE GUIDED BY OUR HEDGING POLICIES AND DETERMINED BASED UPON THE NATURE OF THE EXPOSURE AND PREVAILING MARKET CONDITIONS. TYPICALLY, THE COMPANY MAY ENTER INTO HEDGE CONTRACTS STARTING

12

TO

24

MONTHS IN ADVANCE OF THE FORECASTED TRANSACTION AND MAY PLACE INCREMENTAL HEDGES UP TO

100%

OF THE EXPOSURE BY THE TIME THE FORECASTED TRANSACTION OCCURS. HEDGED TRANSACTIONS ARE PRINCIPALLY DENOMINATED IN EUROS, BRITISH POUNDS, AND JAPANESE YEN. SEE SECTION “FOREIGN CURRENCY EXPOSURES AND HEDGING PRACTICES” UNDER ITEM 7 FOR ADDITIONAL DETAIL.

OUR EARNINGS ARE ALSO EXPOSED TO MOVEMENTS IN SHORT- AND LONG-TERM MARKET INTEREST RATES. OUR OBJECTIVE IN MANAGING THIS INTEREST RATE EXPOSURE IS TO LIMIT THE IMPACT OF INTEREST RATE CHANGES ON EARNINGS AND CASH FLOWS AND TO REDUCE OVERALL BORROWING COSTS. TO ACHIEVE THESE OBJECTIVES, WE MAINTAIN A MIX OF COMMERCIAL PAPER, BANK LOANS, AND FIXED RATE DEBT OF VARYING MATURITIES AND HAVE ENTERED INTO RECEIVE-FIXED, PAY-VARIABLE INTEREST RATE SWAPS FOR A PORTION OF OUR FIXED RATE DEBT.

MARKET RISK MEASUREMENT

WE MONITOR FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK, INTEREST RATE RISK, AND RELATED DERIVATIVES USING A VARIETY OF TECHNIQUES INCLUDING A REVIEW OF MARKET VALUE, SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS, AND VALUE-AT-RISK (“VAR”). OUR MARKET-SENSITIVE DERIVATIVE AND OTHER FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS ARE FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS, FOREIGN CURRENCY OPTION CONTRACTS, INTEREST RATE SWAPS, INTERCOMPANY LOANS DENOMINATED IN NON-FUNCTIONAL CURRENCIES, FIXED INTEREST RATE U.S. DOLLAR DENOMINATED DEBT, AND FIXED INTEREST RATE JAPANESE YEN DENOMINATED DEBT.

WE USE VAR TO MONITOR THE FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK OF OUR FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD AND FOREIGN CURRENCY OPTION DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS ONLY. THE VAR DETERMINES THE MAXIMUM POTENTIAL ONE-DAY LOSS IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THESE FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATE-SENSITIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS. THE VAR MODEL ESTIMATES ASSUME NORMAL MARKET CONDITIONS AND A 95% CONFIDENCE LEVEL. THERE ARE VARIOUS MODELING TECHNIQUES THAT CAN BE USED IN THE VAR COMPUTATION. OUR COMPUTATIONS ARE BASED ON INTERRELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN CURRENCIES AND INTEREST RATES (A “VARIANCE/CO-VARIANCE” TECHNIQUE). THESE INTERRELATIONSHIPS ARE A FUNCTION OF FOREIGN EXCHANGE CURRENCY MARKET CHANGES AND INTEREST RATE CHANGES OVER THE PRECEDING ONE YEAR PERIOD. THE VALUE OF FOREIGN CURRENCY OPTIONS DOES NOT CHANGE ON A ONE-TO-ONE BASIS WITH CHANGES IN THE UNDERLYING CURRENCY RATE. WE ADJUST THE POTENTIAL LOSS IN OPTION VALUE FOR THE ESTIMATED SENSITIVITY (THE “DELTA” AND “GAMMA”) TO CHANGES IN THE UNDERLYING CURRENCY RATE. THIS CALCULATION REFLECTS THE IMPACT OF FOREIGN CURRENCY RATE FLUCTUATIONS ON THE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS ONLY AND DOES NOT INCLUDE THE IMPACT OF SUCH RATE FLUCTUATIONS ON NON-FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY TRANSACTIONS (SUCH AS ANTICIPATED TRANSACTIONS, FIRM COMMITMENTS, CASH BALANCES, AND ACCOUNTS AND LOANS RECEIVABLE AND PAYABLE), INCLUDING THOSE WHICH ARE HEDGED BY THESE INSTRUMENTS.

THE VAR MODEL IS A RISK ANALYSIS TOOL AND DOES NOT PURPORT TO REPRESENT ACTUAL LOSSES IN FAIR VALUE THAT WE WILL INCUR NOR DOES IT CONSIDER THE POTENTIAL EFFECT OF FAVORABLE CHANGES IN MARKET RATES. IT ALSO DOES NOT REPRESENT THE FULL EXTENT OF THE POSSIBLE LOSS THAT MAY OCCUR. ACTUAL FUTURE GAINS AND LOSSES WILL DIFFER FROM THOSE ESTIMATED BECAUSE OF CHANGES OR DIFFERENCES IN MARKET RATES AND INTERRELATIONSHIPS, HEDGING INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGE PERCENTAGES, TIMING, AND OTHER FACTORS.

THE ESTIMATED MAXIMUM ONE-DAY LOSS IN FAIR VALUE ON OUR FOREIGN CURRENCY SENSITIVE DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, DERIVED USING THE VAR MODEL, WAS $50 MILLION AND $34 MILLION AT MAY 31, 2014 AND 2013, RESPECTIVELY. THE VAR INCREASED YEAR-OVER-YEAR AS A RESULT OF AN INCREASE IN THE TOTAL NOTIONAL VALUE OF OUR FOREIGN CURRENCY DERIVATIVE PORTFOLIO COMBINED WITH A LONGER AVERAGE DURATION ON OUR OUTSTANDING TRADES AT MAY 31, 2014. SUCH A HYPOTHETICAL LOSS IN THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR DERIVATIVES WOULD BE OFFSET BY INCREASES IN THE VALUE OF THE UNDERLYING TRANSACTIONS BEING HEDGED. THE AVERAGE MONTHLY CHANGE IN THE FAIR VALUES OF FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD AND FOREIGN CURRENCY OPTION DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS WAS $70 MILLION AND $49 MILLION DURING FISCAL 2014 AND FISCAL 2013, RESPECTIVELY.

THE INSTRUMENTS NOT INCLUDED IN THE VAR ARE INTERCOMPANY LOANS DENOMINATED IN NON-FUNCTIONAL CURRENCIES, FIXED INTEREST RATE JAPANESE YEN DENOMINATED DEBT, FIXED INTEREST RATE U.S. DOLLAR DENOMINATED DEBT, AND INTEREST RATE SWAPS. INTERCOMPANY LOANS AND RELATED INTEREST AMOUNTS ARE ELIMINATED IN CONSOLIDATION. FURTHERMORE, OUR NON-FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY INTERCOMPANY LOANS ARE SUBSTANTIALLY HEDGED AGAINST FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK THROUGH THE USE OF FORWARD CONTRACTS, WHICH ARE INCLUDED IN THE VAR CALCULATION ABOVE. THEREFORE, WE CONSIDER THE INTEREST RATE AND FOREIGN CURRENCY MARKET RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR NON-FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY INTERCOMPANY LOANS TO BE IMMATERIAL TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL POSITION, RESULTS FROM OPERATIONS AND CASH FLOWS.

DETAILS OF THIRD-PARTY DEBT AND INTEREST RATE SWAPS ARE PROVIDED IN THE TABLE BELOW. THE TABLE PRESENTS PRINCIPAL CASH FLOWS AND RELATED WEIGHTED AVERAGE INTEREST RATES BY EXPECTED MATURITY DATES. WEIGHTED AVERAGE INTEREST RATES FOR THE FIXED RATE SWAPPED TO FLOATING RATE DEBT REFLECT THE EFFECTIVE INTEREST RATES AT MAY 31, 2014.

MANAGEMENT’S ANNUAL REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

MANAGEMENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ESTABLISHING AND MAINTAINING ADEQUATE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, AS SUCH TERM IS DEFINED IN RULE 13(A) - 15(F) AND RULE 15(D) - 15(F) OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934, AS AMENDED. INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING IS A PROCESS DESIGNED TO PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING THE RELIABILITY OF FINANCIAL REPORTING AND THE PREPARATION OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR EXTERNAL PURPOSES IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING INCLUDES THOSE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES THAT: (I) PERTAIN TO THE MAINTENANCE OF RECORDS THAT, IN REASONABLE DETAIL, ACCURATELY AND FAIRLY REFLECT THE TRANSACTIONS AND DISPOSITIONS OF ASSETS OF THE COMPANY; (II) PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE THAT TRANSACTIONS ARE RECORDED AS NECESSARY TO PERMIT PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES, AND THAT RECEIPTS AND EXPENDITURES OF THE COMPANY ARE BEING MADE ONLY IN ACCORDANCE WITH AUTHORIZATIONS OF OUR MANAGEMENT AND DIRECTORS; AND (III) PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING PREVENTION OR TIMELY DETECTION OF UNAUTHORIZED ACQUISITION, USE, OR DISPOSITION OF ASSETS OF THE COMPANY THAT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

WHILE “REASONABLE ASSURANCE” IS A HIGH LEVEL OF ASSURANCE, IT DOES NOT MEAN ABSOLUTE ASSURANCE. BECAUSE OF ITS INHERENT LIMITATIONS, INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING MAY NOT PREVENT OR DETECT EVERY MISSTATEMENT AND INSTANCE OF FRAUD. CONTROLS ARE SUSCEPTIBLE TO MANIPULATION, ESPECIALLY IN INSTANCES OF FRAUD CAUSED BY THE COLLUSION OF TWO OR MORE PEOPLE, INCLUDING OUR SENIOR MANAGEMENT. ALSO, PROJECTIONS OF ANY EVALUATION OF EFFECTIVENESS TO FUTURE PERIODS ARE SUBJECT TO THE RISK THAT CONTROLS MAY BECOME INADEQUATE BECAUSE OF CHANGES IN CONDITIONS, OR THAT THE DEGREE OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE POLICIES OR PROCEDURES MAY DETERIORATE.

UNDER THE SUPERVISION AND WITH THE PARTICIPATION OF OUR CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER, OUR MANAGEMENT CONDUCTED AN EVALUATION OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING BASED UPON THE FRAMEWORK IN

INTERNAL CONTROL — INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK

(1992)

ISSUED BY THE COMMITTEE OF SPONSORING ORGANIZATIONS OF THE TREADWAY COMMISSION (COSO). BASED ON THE RESULTS OF OUR EVALUATION, OUR MANAGEMENT CONCLUDED THAT OUR INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING WAS EFFECTIVE AS OF

MAY 31, 2014.

, BASED ON CRITERIA ESTABLISHED IN

INTERNAL CONTROL — INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK

(1992)

ISSUED BY THE COMMITTEE OF SPONSORING ORGANIZATIONS OF THE TREADWAY COMMISSION (COSO). THE COMPANY’S MANAGEMENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND FINANCIAL STATEMENT SCHEDULE, FOR MAINTAINING EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AND FOR ITS ASSESSMENT OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, INCLUDED IN MANAGEMENT’S ANNUAL REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING APPEARING UNDER ITEM 8. OUR RESPONSIBILITY IS TO EXPRESS OPINIONS ON THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENT SCHEDULE, AND ON THE COMPANY’S INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING BASED ON OUR INTEGRATED AUDITS. WE CONDUCTED OUR AUDITS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE STANDARDS OF THE PUBLIC COMPANY ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BOARD (UNITED STATES). THOSE STANDARDS REQUIRE THAT WE PLAN AND PERFORM THE AUDITS TO OBTAIN REASONABLE ASSURANCE ABOUT WHETHER THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE FREE OF MATERIAL MISSTATEMENT AND WHETHER EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING WAS MAINTAINED IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS. OUR AUDITS OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED EXAMINING, ON A TEST BASIS, EVIDENCE SUPPORTING THE AMOUNTS AND DISCLOSURES IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, ASSESSING THE ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES USED AND SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES MADE BY MANAGEMENT, AND EVALUATING THE OVERALL FINANCIAL STATEMENT PRESENTATION. OUR AUDIT OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING INCLUDED OBTAINING AN UNDERSTANDING OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, ASSESSING THE RISK THAT A MATERIAL WEAKNESS EXISTS, AND TESTING AND EVALUATING THE DESIGN AND OPERATING EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL CONTROL BASED ON THE ASSESSED RISK. OUR AUDITS ALSO INCLUDED PERFORMING SUCH OTHER PROCEDURES AS WE CONSIDERED NECESSARY IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR AUDITS PROVIDE A REASONABLE BASIS FOR OUR OPINIONS.

A COMPANY’S INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING IS A PROCESS DESIGNED TO PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING THE RELIABILITY OF FINANCIAL REPORTING AND THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR EXTERNAL PURPOSES IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES. A COMPANY’S INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING INCLUDES THOSE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES THAT (I) PERTAIN TO THE MAINTENANCE OF RECORDS THAT, IN REASONABLE DETAIL, ACCURATELY AND FAIRLY REFLECT THE TRANSACTIONS AND DISPOSITIONS OF THE ASSETS OF THE COMPANY; (II) PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE THAT TRANSACTIONS ARE RECORDED AS NECESSARY TO PERMIT PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES, AND THAT RECEIPTS AND EXPENDITURES OF THE COMPANY ARE BEING MADE ONLY IN ACCORDANCE WITH AUTHORIZATIONS OF MANAGEMENT AND DIRECTORS OF THE COMPANY; AND (III) PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING PREVENTION OR TIMELY DETECTION OF UNAUTHORIZED ACQUISITION, USE, OR DISPOSITION OF THE COMPANY’S ASSETS THAT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

BECAUSE OF ITS INHERENT LIMITATIONS, INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING MAY NOT PREVENT OR DETECT MISSTATEMENTS. ALSO, PROJECTIONS OF ANY EVALUATION OF EFFECTIVENESS TO FUTURE PERIODS ARE SUBJECT TO THE RISK THAT CONTROLS MAY BECOME INADEQUATE BECAUSE OF CHANGES IN CONDITIONS, OR THAT THE DEGREE OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE POLICIES OR PROCEDURES MAY DETERIORATE.

RECOGNITION OF REVENUES

WHOLESALE REVENUES ARE RECOGNIZED WHEN TITLE AND THE RISKS AND REWARDS OF OWNERSHIP HAVE PASSED TO THE CUSTOMER, BASED ON THE TERMS OF SALE. THIS OCCURS UPON SHIPMENT OR UPON RECEIPT BY THE CUSTOMER DEPENDING ON THE COUNTRY OF THE SALE AND THE AGREEMENT WITH THE CUSTOMER. RETAIL STORE REVENUES ARE RECORDED AT THE TIME OF SALE. PROVISIONS FOR POST-INVOICE SALES DISCOUNTS, RETURNS AND MISCELLANEOUS CLAIMS FROM CUSTOMERS ARE ESTIMATED AND RECORDED AS A REDUCTION TO REVENUE AT THE TIME OF SALE. POST-INVOICE SALES DISCOUNTS CONSIST OF CONTRACTUAL PROGRAMS WITH CERTAIN CUSTOMERS OR DISCRETIONARY DISCOUNTS THAT ARE EXPECTED TO BE GRANTED TO CERTAIN CUSTOMERS AT A LATER DATE. ESTIMATES OF DISCRETIONARY DISCOUNTS, RETURNS AND CLAIMS ARE BASED ON HISTORICAL RATES, SPECIFIC IDENTIFICATION OF OUTSTANDING CLAIMS AND OUTSTANDING RETURNS NOT YET RECEIVED FROM CUSTOMERS, AND ESTIMATED DISCOUNTS, RETURNS AND CLAIMS EXPECTED BUT NOT YET FINALIZED WITH CUSTOMERS. AS OF

MAY 31, 2014

AND

TABLE OF CONTENTS

DEMAND CREATION EXPENSE

DEMAND CREATION EXPENSE CONSISTS OF ADVERTISING AND PROMOTION COSTS, INCLUDING COSTS OF ENDORSEMENT CONTRACTS, TELEVISION, DIGITAL AND PRINT ADVERTISING, BRAND EVENTS, AND RETAIL BRAND PRESENTATION. ADVERTISING PRODUCTION COSTS ARE EXPENSED THE FIRST TIME AN ADVERTISEMENT IS RUN. ADVERTISING PLACEMENT COSTS ARE EXPENSED IN THE MONTH THE ADVERTISING APPEARS, WHILE COSTS RELATED TO BRAND EVENTS ARE EXPENSED WHEN THE EVENT OCCURS. COSTS RELATED TO RETAIL BRAND PRESENTATION ARE EXPENSED WHEN THE PRESENTATION IS COMPLETED AND DELIVERED.

A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF THE COMPANY’S PROMOTIONAL EXPENSES RESULT FROM PAYMENTS UNDER ENDORSEMENT CONTRACTS. ACCOUNTING FOR ENDORSEMENT PAYMENTS IS BASED UPON SPECIFIC CONTRACT PROVISIONS. GENERALLY, ENDORSEMENT PAYMENTS ARE EXPENSED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THE TERM OF THE CONTRACT AFTER GIVING RECOGNITION TO PERIODIC PERFORMANCE COMPLIANCE PROVISIONS OF THE CONTRACTS. PREPAYMENTS MADE UNDER CONTRACTS ARE INCLUDED IN PREPAID EXPENSES AND OTHER CURRENT ASSETS OR DEFERRED INCOME TAXES AND OTHER ASSETS DEPENDING ON THE PERIOD TO WHICH THE PREPAYMENT APPLIES.

CERTAIN CONTRACTS PROVIDE FOR CONTINGENT PAYMENTS TO ENDORSERS BASED UPON SPECIFIC ACHIEVEMENTS IN THEIR SPORTS (E.G., WINNING A CHAMPIONSHIP). THE COMPANY RECORDS DEMAND CREATION EXPENSE FOR THESE AMOUNTS WHEN THE ENDORSER ACHIEVES THE SPECIFIC GOAL.

CERTAIN CONTRACTS PROVIDE FOR VARIABLE PAYMENTS BASED UPON ENDORSERS MAINTAINING A LEVEL OF PERFORMANCE IN THEIR SPORT OVER AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF TIME (E.G., MAINTAINING A SPECIFIED RANKING IN A SPORT FOR A YEAR). THESE AMOUNTS ARE RECORDED IN DEMAND CREATION EXPENSE WHEN THE COMPANY DETERMINES THAT IT IS PROBABLE THAT THE SPECIFIED LEVEL OF PERFORMANCE WILL BE MAINTAINED THROUGHOUT THE PERIOD. IN THESE INSTANCES, TO THE EXTENT THAT ACTUAL PAYMENTS TO THE ENDORSER DIFFER FROM THE COMPANY'S ESTIMATE DUE TO CHANGES IN THE ENDORSER’S PERFORMANCE, INCREASED OR DECREASED DEMAND CREATION EXPENSE MAY BE RECORDED IN A FUTURE PERIOD.

CERTAIN CONTRACTS PROVIDE FOR ROYALTY PAYMENTS TO ENDORSERS BASED UPON A PREDETERMINED PERCENTAGE OF SALES OF PARTICULAR PRODUCTS. THE COMPANY EXPENSES THESE PAYMENTS IN COST OF SALES AS THE RELATED SALES OCCUR. IN CERTAIN CONTRACTS, THE COMPANY OFFERS MINIMUM GUARANTEED ROYALTY PAYMENTS. FOR CONTRACTS FOR WHICH THE COMPANY ESTIMATES IT WILL NOT MEET THE MINIMUM GUARANTEED AMOUNT OF ROYALTY FEES THROUGH SALES OF PRODUCT, THE COMPANY RECORDS THE AMOUNT OF THE GUARANTEED PAYMENT IN EXCESS OF THAT EARNED THROUGH SALES OF PRODUCT IN DEMAND CREATION EXPENSE UNIFORMLY OVER THE REMAINING GUARANTEE PERIOD.

THROUGH COOPERATIVE ADVERTISING PROGRAMS, THE COMPANY REIMBURSES RETAIL CUSTOMERS FOR CERTAIN COSTS OF ADVERTISING THE COMPANY’S PRODUCTS. THE COMPANY RECORDS THESE COSTS IN DEMAND CREATION EXPENSE AT THE POINT IN TIME WHEN IT IS OBLIGATED TO ITS CUSTOMERS FOR THE COSTS, WHICH IS WHEN THE RELATED REVENUES ARE RECOGNIZED. THIS OBLIGATION MAY ARISE PRIOR TO THE RELATED ADVERTISEMENT BEING RUN.

TOTAL ADVERTISING AND PROMOTION EXPENSES WERE

$3,031 MILLION

,

$2,745 MILLION

, AND

$2,607 MILLION

AT

MAY 31, 2014

AND

2013

, SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS CONSISTED OF AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE SECURITIES. AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE SECURITIES ARE RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE WITH UNREALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES REPORTED, NET OF TAX, IN OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME, UNLESS UNREALIZED LOSSES ARE DETERMINED TO BE OTHER THAN TEMPORARY. REALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES ON THE SALE OF SECURITIES ARE DETERMINED BY SPECIFIC IDENTIFICATION. THE COMPANY CONSIDERS ALL AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE SECURITIES, INCLUDING THOSE WITH MATURITY DATES BEYOND 12 MONTHS, AS AVAILABLE TO SUPPORT CURRENT OPERATIONAL LIQUIDITY NEEDS AND THEREFORE CLASSIFIES ALL SECURITIES WITH MATURITY DATES BEYOND THREE MONTHS AT THE DATE OF PURCHASE AS CURRENT ASSETS WITHIN SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS.

REFER TO NOTE 6 — FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS FOR MORE INFORMATION ON THE COMPANY’S SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS.

ALLOWANCE FOR UNCOLLECTIBLE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE

ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE CONSISTS PRIMARILY OF AMOUNTS RECEIVABLE FROM CUSTOMERS. THE COMPANY MAKES ONGOING ESTIMATES RELATING TO THE COLLECTABILITY OF ITS ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND MAINTAINS AN ALLOWANCE FOR ESTIMATED LOSSES RESULTING FROM THE INABILITY OF ITS CUSTOMERS TO MAKE REQUIRED PAYMENTS. IN DETERMINING THE AMOUNT OF THE ALLOWANCE, THE COMPANY CONSIDERS HISTORICAL LEVELS OF CREDIT LOSSES AND MAKES JUDGMENTS ABOUT THE CREDITWORTHINESS OF SIGNIFICANT CUSTOMERS BASED ON ONGOING CREDIT EVALUATIONS. ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE WITH ANTICIPATED COLLECTION DATES GREATER THAN 12 MONTHS FROM THE BALANCE SHEET DATE AND RELATED ALLOWANCES ARE CONSIDERED NON-CURRENT AND RECORDED IN DEFERRED INCOME TAXES AND OTHER ASSETS. THE ALLOWANCE FOR UNCOLLECTIBLE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE WAS

FOR INVENTORIES IN TRANSIT THAT REPRESENT DIRECT SHIPMENTS TO CUSTOMERS, THE RELATED INVENTORY AND COST OF SALES IS RECOGNIZED ON A SPECIFIC IDENTIFICATION BASIS.

53

TABLE OF CONTENTS

PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT AND DEPRECIATION

PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT ARE RECORDED AT COST. DEPRECIATION IS DETERMINED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS FOR BUILDINGS AND LEASEHOLD IMPROVEMENTS OVER

2

TO

40

YEARS AND FOR MACHINERY AND EQUIPMENT OVER

2

TO

15

YEARS.

DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION OF ASSETS USED IN MANUFACTURING, WAREHOUSING AND PRODUCT DISTRIBUTION ARE RECORDED IN COST OF SALES. DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION OF OTHER ASSETS ARE RECORDED IN TOTAL SELLING AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE.

SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT COSTS

. EXPENDITURES FOR MAJOR SOFTWARE PURCHASES AND SOFTWARE DEVELOPED FOR INTERNAL USE ARE CAPITALIZED AND AMORTIZED OVER A

2

TO

10

YEAR PERIOD ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS. THE COMPANY’S POLICY PROVIDES FOR THE CAPITALIZATION OF EXTERNAL DIRECT COSTS OF MATERIALS AND SERVICES ASSOCIATED WITH DEVELOPING OR OBTAINING INTERNAL USE COMPUTER SOFTWARE. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY ALSO CAPITALIZES CERTAIN PAYROLL AND PAYROLL-RELATED COSTS FOR EMPLOYEES WHO ARE DIRECTLY ASSOCIATED WITH INTERNAL USE COMPUTER SOFTWARE PROJECTS. THE AMOUNT OF CAPITALIZABLE PAYROLL COSTS WITH RESPECT TO THESE EMPLOYEES IS LIMITED TO THE TIME DIRECTLY SPENT ON SUCH PROJECTS. COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH PRELIMINARY PROJECT STAGE ACTIVITIES, TRAINING, MAINTENANCE AND ALL OTHER POST-IMPLEMENTATION STAGE ACTIVITIES ARE EXPENSED AS INCURRED.

COMPUTER SOFTWARE TO BE SOLD, LEASED OR OTHERWISE MARKETED

. DEVELOPMENT COSTS OF COMPUTER SOFTWARE TO BE SOLD, LEASED, OR OTHERWISE MARKETED AS AN INTEGRAL PART OF A PRODUCT ARE SUBJECT TO CAPITALIZATION BEGINNING WHEN A PRODUCT’S TECHNOLOGICAL FEASIBILITY HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED AND ENDING WHEN A PRODUCT IS AVAILABLE FOR GENERAL RELEASE TO CUSTOMERS. IN MOST INSTANCES, THE COMPANY’S PRODUCTS ARE RELEASED SOON AFTER TECHNOLOGICAL FEASIBILITY HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED. THEREFORE, SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT COSTS INCURRED SUBSEQUENT TO ACHIEVEMENT OF TECHNOLOGICAL FEASIBILITY ARE USUALLY NOT SIGNIFICANT, AND GENERALLY MOST SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT COSTS HAVE BEEN EXPENSED AS INCURRED.

IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS

THE COMPANY REVIEWS THE CARRYING VALUE OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS OR ASSET GROUPS TO BE USED IN OPERATIONS WHENEVER EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THAT THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF THE ASSETS MIGHT NOT BE RECOVERABLE. FACTORS THAT WOULD NECESSITATE AN IMPAIRMENT ASSESSMENT INCLUDE A SIGNIFICANT ADVERSE CHANGE IN THE EXTENT OR MANNER IN WHICH AN ASSET IS USED, A SIGNIFICANT ADVERSE CHANGE IN LEGAL FACTORS OR THE BUSINESS CLIMATE THAT COULD AFFECT THE VALUE OF THE ASSET, OR A SIGNIFICANT DECLINE IN THE OBSERVABLE MARKET VALUE OF AN ASSET, AMONG OTHERS. IF SUCH FACTS INDICATE A POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT, THE COMPANY WOULD ASSESS THE RECOVERABILITY OF AN ASSET GROUP BY DETERMINING IF THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE ASSET GROUP EXCEEDS THE SUM OF THE PROJECTED UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS EXPECTED TO RESULT FROM THE USE AND EVENTUAL DISPOSITION OF THE ASSETS OVER THE REMAINING ECONOMIC LIFE OF THE PRIMARY ASSET IN THE ASSET GROUP. IF THE RECOVERABILITY TEST INDICATES THAT THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE ASSET GROUP IS NOT RECOVERABLE, THE COMPANY WILL ESTIMATE THE FAIR VALUE OF THE ASSET GROUP USING APPROPRIATE VALUATION METHODOLOGIES, WHICH WOULD TYPICALLY INCLUDE AN ESTIMATE OF DISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS. ANY IMPAIRMENT WOULD BE MEASURED AS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE ASSET GROUP’S CARRYING AMOUNT AND ITS ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE.

GOODWILL AND INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS

THE COMPANY PERFORMS ANNUAL IMPAIRMENT TESTS ON GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS WITH INDEFINITE LIVES IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF EACH FISCAL YEAR, OR WHEN EVENTS OCCUR OR CIRCUMSTANCES CHANGE THAT WOULD, MORE LIKELY THAN NOT, REDUCE THE FAIR VALUE OF A REPORTING UNIT OR AN INTANGIBLE ASSET WITH AN INDEFINITE LIFE BELOW ITS CARRYING VALUE. EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES THAT MAY TRIGGER INTERIM IMPAIRMENT REVIEWS INCLUDE SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN BUSINESS CLIMATE, OPERATING RESULTS, PLANNED INVESTMENTS IN THE REPORTING UNIT, PLANNED DIVESTITURES OR AN EXPECTATION THAT THE CARRYING AMOUNT MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE, AMONG OTHER FACTORS. THE COMPANY MAY FIRST ASSESS QUALITATIVE FACTORS TO DETERMINE WHETHER IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT THE FAIR VALUE OF A REPORTING UNIT IS LESS THAN ITS CARRYING AMOUNT. IF, AFTER ASSESSING THE TOTALITY OF EVENTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES, THE COMPANY DETERMINES THAT IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT THE FAIR VALUE OF THE REPORTING UNIT IS GREATER THAN ITS CARRYING AMOUNT, THE TWO-STEP IMPAIRMENT TEST IS UNNECESSARY. THE TWO-STEP IMPAIRMENT TEST FIRST REQUIRES THE COMPANY TO ESTIMATE THE FAIR VALUE OF ITS REPORTING UNITS. IF THE CARRYING VALUE OF A REPORTING UNIT EXCEEDS ITS FAIR VALUE, THE GOODWILL OF THAT REPORTING UNIT IS POTENTIALLY IMPAIRED AND THE COMPANY PROCEEDS TO STEP TWO OF THE IMPAIRMENT ANALYSIS. IN STEP TWO OF THE ANALYSIS, THE COMPANY MEASURES AND RECORDS AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS EQUAL TO THE EXCESS OF THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE REPORTING UNIT'S GOODWILL OVER ITS IMPLIED FAIR VALUE, IF ANY.

THE COMPANY GENERALLY BASES ITS MEASUREMENT OF THE FAIR VALUE OF A REPORTING UNIT ON A BLENDED ANALYSIS OF THE PRESENT VALUE OF FUTURE DISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS AND THE MARKET VALUATION APPROACH. THE DISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS MODEL INDICATES THE FAIR VALUE OF THE REPORTING UNIT BASED ON THE PRESENT VALUE OF THE CASH FLOWS THAT THE COMPANY EXPECTS THE REPORTING UNIT TO GENERATE IN THE FUTURE. THE COMPANY'S SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES IN THE DISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS MODEL INCLUDE: ITS WEIGHTED AVERAGE COST OF CAPITAL; LONG-TERM RATE OF GROWTH AND PROFITABILITY OF THE REPORTING UNIT'S BUSINESS; AND WORKING CAPITAL EFFECTS. THE MARKET VALUATION APPROACH INDICATES THE FAIR VALUE OF THE BUSINESS BASED ON A COMPARISON OF THE REPORTING UNIT TO COMPARABLE PUBLICLY TRADED COMPANIES IN SIMILAR LINES OF BUSINESS. SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES IN THE MARKET VALUATION APPROACH MODEL INCLUDE IDENTIFYING SIMILAR COMPANIES WITH COMPARABLE BUSINESS FACTORS SUCH AS SIZE, GROWTH, PROFITABILITY, RISK AND RETURN ON INVESTMENT, AND ASSESSING COMPARABLE REVENUE AND OPERATING INCOME MULTIPLES IN ESTIMATING THE FAIR VALUE OF THE REPORTING UNIT.

INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS PRIMARILY CONSIST OF ACQUIRED TRADE NAMES AND TRADEMARKS. THE COMPANY MAY FIRST PERFORM A QUALITATIVE ASSESSMENT TO DETERMINE WHETHER IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT AN INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSET IS IMPAIRED. IF, AFTER ASSESSING THE TOTALITY OF EVENTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES, THE

C

OMPANY DETERMINES THAT IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT THE INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSET IS NOT IMPAIRED, NO QUANTITATIVE FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT IS NECESSARY. IF A QUANTITATIVE FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT CALCULATION IS REQUIRED FOR THESE INTANGIBLE ASSETS, THE COMPANY UTILIZES THE RELIEF-FROM-ROYALTY METHOD. THIS METHOD ASSUMES THAT TRADE NAMES AND TRADEMARKS HAVE VALUE TO THE EXTENT THAT THEIR OWNER IS RELIEVED OF THE OBLIGATION TO PAY ROYALTIES FOR THE BENEFITS RECEIVED FROM THEM. THIS METHOD REQUIRES THE COMPANY TO ESTIMATE THE FUTURE REVENUE FOR THE RELATED BRANDS, THE APPROPRIATE ROYALTY RATE AND THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE COST OF CAPITAL.

OPERATING LEASES

THE COMPANY LEASES RETAIL STORE SPACE, CERTAIN DISTRIBUTION AND WAREHOUSE FACILITIES, OFFICE SPACE, AND OTHER NON-REAL ESTATE ASSETS UNDER OPERATING LEASES. OPERATING LEASE AGREEMENTS MAY CONTAIN RENT ESCALATION CLAUSES, RENT HOLIDAYS OR CERTAIN LANDLORD INCENTIVES, INCLUDING TENANT IMPROVEMENT ALLOWANCES. RENT EXPENSE FOR NON-CANCELABLE OPERATING LEASES WITH SCHEDULED RENT INCREASES OR LANDLORD INCENTIVES ARE RECOGNIZED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THE LEASE TERM, BEGINNING WITH THE EFFECTIVE LEASE COMMENCEMENT DATE, WHICH IS GENERALLY THE DATE IN WHICH THE COMPANY TAKES POSSESSION OF OR CONTROLS THE PHYSICAL USE OF THE PROPERTY. CERTAIN LEASES ALSO PROVIDE FOR CONTINGENT RENTS, WHICH ARE DETERMINED AS A PERCENTAGE OF SALES IN EXCESS OF SPECIFIED LEVELS. A CONTINGENT RENT LIABILITY IS RECOGNIZED TOGETHER WITH THE CORRESPONDING RENT EXPENSE WHEN SPECIFIED LEVELS HAVE BEEN ACHIEVED OR WHEN THE COMPANY DETERMINES THAT ACHIEVING THE SPECIFIED LEVELS DURING THE PERIOD IS PROBABLE.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

THE COMPANY MEASURES CERTAIN FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AT FAIR VALUE ON A RECURRING BASIS, INCLUDING DERIVATIVES AND AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE SECURITIES. FAIR VALUE IS THE PRICE THE COMPANY WOULD RECEIVE TO SELL AN ASSET OR PAY TO TRANSFER A LIABILITY IN AN ORDERLY TRANSACTION WITH A MARKET PARTICIPANT AT THE MEASUREMENT DATE. THE COMPANY USES A THREE-LEVEL HIERARCHY ESTABLISHED BY THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD ("FASB") THAT PRIORITIZES FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS BASED ON THE TYPES OF INPUTS USED FOR THE VARIOUS VALUATION TECHNIQUES (MARKET APPROACH, INCOME APPROACH, AND COST APPROACH).

THE LEVELS OF HIERARCHY ARE DESCRIBED BELOW.

•

LEVEL 1: OBSERVABLE INPUTS SUCH AS QUOTED PRICES IN ACTIVE MARKETS FOR IDENTICAL ASSETS OR LIABILITIES.

•

LEVEL 2: INPUTS OTHER THAN QUOTED PRICES THAT ARE OBSERVABLE FOR THE ASSET OR LIABILITY, EITHER DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY; THESE INCLUDE QUOTED PRICES FOR SIMILAR ASSETS OR LIABILITIES IN ACTIVE MARKETS AND QUOTED PRICES FOR IDENTICAL OR SIMILAR ASSETS OR LIABILITIES IN MARKETS THAT ARE NOT ACTIVE.

•

LEVEL 3: UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS FOR WHICH THERE IS LITTLE OR NO MARKET DATA AVAILABLE, WHICH REQUIRE THE REPORTING ENTITY TO DEVELOP ITS OWN ASSUMPTIONS.

THE COMPANY’S ASSESSMENT OF THE SIGNIFICANCE OF A PARTICULAR INPUT TO THE FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT IN ITS ENTIRETY REQUIRES JUDGMENT AND CONSIDERS FACTORS SPECIFIC TO THE ASSET OR LIABILITY. FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE CLASSIFIED IN THEIR ENTIRETY BASED ON THE MOST CONSERVATIVE LEVEL OF INPUT THAT IS SIGNIFICANT TO THE FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT.

PRICING VENDORS ARE UTILIZED FOR CERTAIN LEVEL 1 AND LEVEL 2 INVESTMENTS. THESE VENDORS EITHER PROVIDE A QUOTED MARKET PRICE IN AN ACTIVE MARKET OR USE OBSERVABLE INPUTS WITHOUT APPLYING SIGNIFICANT ADJUSTMENTS IN THEIR PRICING. OBSERVABLE INPUTS INCLUDE BROKER QUOTES, INTEREST RATES AND YIELD CURVES OBSERVABLE AT COMMONLY QUOTED INTERVALS, VOLATILITIES AND CREDIT RISKS. THE FAIR VALUE OF DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS IS DETERMINED USING OBSERVABLE MARKET INPUTS SUCH AS THE DAILY MARKET FOREIGN CURRENCY RATES, FORWARD PRICING CURVES, CURRENCY VOLATILITIES, CURRENCY CORRELATIONS AND INTEREST RATES, AND CONSIDERS NONPERFORMANCE RISK OF THE COMPANY AND THAT OF ITS COUNTERPARTIES.

THE COMPANY’S FAIR VALUE PROCESSES INCLUDE CONTROLS THAT ARE DESIGNED TO ENSURE APPROPRIATE FAIR VALUES ARE RECORDED. THESE CONTROLS INCLUDE AN ANALYSIS OF PERIOD-OVER-PERIOD FLUCTUATIONS AND COMPARISON TO ANOTHER INDEPENDENT PRICING VENDOR.

REFER TO NOTE 6 — FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION.

FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION AND FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSACTIONS

ADJUSTMENTS RESULTING FROM TRANSLATING FOREIGN FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INTO U.S. DOLLARS ARE INCLUDED IN THE FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENT, A COMPONENT OF ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME IN TOTAL SHAREHOLDERS’ EQUITY.

THE COMPANY’S GLOBAL SUBSIDIARIES HAVE VARIOUS ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, PRIMARILY RECEIVABLES AND PAYABLES, WHICH ARE DENOMINATED IN CURRENCIES OTHER THAN THEIR FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY. THESE BALANCE SHEET ITEMS ARE SUBJECT TO RE-MEASUREMENT, THE IMPACT OF WHICH IS RECORDED IN

OTHER EXPENSE (INCOME), NET

, WITHIN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME.

ACCOUNTING FOR DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES

THE COMPANY USES DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS TO REDUCE ITS EXPOSURE TO CHANGES IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES AND INTEREST RATES. ALL DERIVATIVES ARE RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS AND CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS ARE EITHER RECOGNIZED IN ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (A COMPONENT OF TOTAL SHAREHOLDERS’ EQUITY), LONG-TERM DEBT OR NET INCOME DEPENDING ON THE NATURE OF THE UNDERLYING EXPOSURE, WHETHER THE DERIVATIVE IS FORMALLY DESIGNATED AS A HEDGE, AND, IF DESIGNATED, THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE HEDGE IS EFFECTIVE. THE COMPANY CLASSIFIES THE CASH FLOWS AT SETTLEMENT FROM DERIVATIVES IN THE SAME CATEGORY AS THE CASH FLOWS FROM THE RELATED HEDGED ITEMS. FOR UNDESIGNATED HEDGES AND DESIGNATED CASH FLOW HEDGES, THIS IS WITHIN THE CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATIONS COMPONENT OF THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS. FOR DESIGNATED NET INVESTMENT HEDGES, THIS IS GENERALLY WITHIN THE CASH (USED) PROVIDED BY INVESTING ACTIVITIES COMPONENT OF THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS. FOR THE COMPANY’S FAIR VALUE HEDGES, WHICH ARE INTEREST RATE SWAPS USED TO MITIGATE THE CHANGE IN FAIR VALUE OF ITS FIXED-RATE DEBT ATTRIBUTABLE TO CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES, THE RELATED CASH FLOWS FROM PERIODIC INTEREST PAYMENTS ARE REFLECTED WITHIN THE CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATIONS COMPONENT OF THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS. REFER TO NOTE 17 — RISK MANAGEMENT AND DERIVATIVES FOR MORE INFORMATION ON THE COMPANY’S RISK MANAGEMENT PROGRAM AND DERIVATIVES.

STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION

THE COMPANY ESTIMATES THE FAIR VALUE OF OPTIONS AND STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS GRANTED UNDER THE NIKE, INC. 1990 STOCK INCENTIVE PLAN (THE “1990 PLAN”) AND EMPLOYEES’ PURCHASE RIGHTS UNDER THE EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLANS (“ESPPS”) USING THE BLACK-SCHOLES OPTION PRICING MODEL. THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES THIS FAIR VALUE, NET OF ESTIMATED FORFEITURES, AS TOTAL SELLING AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME OVER THE VESTING PERIOD USING THE STRAIGHT-LINE METHOD.

REFER TO NOTE 11 — COMMON STOCK AND STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION FOR MORE INFORMATION ON THE COMPANY’S STOCK PROGRAMS.

INCOME TAXES

THE COMPANY ACCOUNTS FOR INCOME TAXES USING THE ASSET AND LIABILITY METHOD. THIS APPROACH REQUIRES THE RECOGNITION OF DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES FOR THE EXPECTED FUTURE TAX CONSEQUENCES OF TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE CARRYING AMOUNTS AND THE TAX BASIS OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. THE COMPANY RECORDS A VALUATION ALLOWANCE TO REDUCE DEFERRED TAX ASSETS TO THE AMOUNT MANAGEMENT BELIEVES IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT TO BE REALIZED. UNITED STATES INCOME TAXES ARE PROVIDED CURRENTLY ON FINANCIAL STATEMENT EARNINGS OF NON-U.S. SUBSIDIARIES THAT ARE EXPECTED TO BE REPATRIATED. THE COMPANY DETERMINES ANNUALLY THE AMOUNT OF UNDISTRIBUTED NON-U.S. EARNINGS TO INVEST INDEFINITELY IN ITS NON-U.S. OPERATIONS.

THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES A TAX BENEFIT FROM UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ONLY WHEN IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT THE POSITION WILL BE SUSTAINED UPON EXAMINATION BY RELEVANT TAX AUTHORITIES. THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES INTEREST AND PENALTIES RELATED TO INCOME TAX MATTERS IN INCOME TAX EXPENSE.

REFER TO NOTE 9 — INCOME TAXES FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION.

EARNINGS PER SHARE

BASIC EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE IS CALCULATED BY DIVIDING NET INCOME BY THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE NUMBER OF COMMON SHARES OUTSTANDING DURING THE YEAR. DILUTED EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE IS CALCULATED BY ADJUSTING WEIGHTED AVERAGE OUTSTANDING SHARES, ASSUMING CONVERSION OF ALL POTENTIALLY DILUTIVE STOCK OPTIONS AND AWARDS.

REFER TO NOTE 12 — EARNINGS PER SHARE FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION.

MANAGEMENT ESTIMATES

THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN CONFORMITY WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO MAKE ESTIMATES, INCLUDING ESTIMATES RELATING TO ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AND DISCLOSURE OF CONTINGENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AT THE DATE OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF REVENUES AND EXPENSES DURING THE REPORTING PERIOD. ACTUAL RESULTS COULD DIFFER FROM THESE ESTIMATES.

RECENTLY ADOPTED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

IN JULY 2013, THE FASB ISSUED AN ACCOUNTING STANDARDS UPDATE INTENDED TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE ON THE PRESENTATION OF UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS, REFLECTING THE MANNER IN WHICH AN ENTITY WOULD SETTLE, AT THE REPORTING DATE, ANY ADDITIONAL INCOME TAXES THAT WOULD RESULT FROM THE DISALLOWANCE OF A TAX POSITION WHEN NET OPERATING LOSS CARRYFORWARDS, SIMILAR TAX LOSSES, OR TAX CREDIT CARRYFORWARDS EXIST. THIS ACCOUNTING STANDARD IS EFFECTIVE FOR THE COMPANY BEGINNING JUNE 1, 2014 AND EARLY ADOPTION IS PERMITTED. MANAGEMENT EARLY ADOPTED THIS GUIDANCE AND THE ADOPTION DID NOT HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE COMPANY'S CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL POSITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

IN JULY 2012, THE FASB ISSUED AN ACCOUNTING STANDARDS UPDATE INTENDED TO SIMPLIFY HOW AN ENTITY TESTS INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS OTHER THAN GOODWILL FOR IMPAIRMENT BY PROVIDING ENTITIES WITH AN OPTION TO PERFORM A QUALITATIVE ASSESSMENT TO DETERMINE WHETHER FURTHER IMPAIRMENT TESTING IS NECESSARY. THIS ACCOUNTING STANDARD UPDATE WAS EFFECTIVE FOR US BEGINNING JUNE 1, 2013. THE ADOPTION OF THIS STANDARD DID NOT HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL POSITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

IN DECEMBER 2011, THE FASB ISSUED GUIDANCE ENHANCING DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS SURROUNDING THE NATURE OF AN ENTITY’S RIGHT TO OFFSET AND RELATED ARRANGEMENTS ASSOCIATED WITH ITS FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS. THIS NEW GUIDANCE REQUIRES COMPANIES TO DISCLOSE BOTH GROSS AND NET INFORMATION ABOUT INSTRUMENTS AND TRANSACTIONS ELIGIBLE FOR OFFSET IN THE STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION AND INSTRUMENTS AND TRANSACTIONS SUBJECT TO MASTER NETTING ARRANGEMENTS. THIS NEW GUIDANCE WAS EFFECTIVE FOR THE COMPANY BEGINNING JUNE 1, 2013. AS THIS GUIDANCE ONLY REQUIRES EXPANDED DISCLOSURES, THE ADOPTION HAD NO IMPACT ON THE COMPANY'S CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL POSITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

IN MAY 2014, THE FASB ISSUED AN ACCOUNTING STANDARDS UPDATE THAT REPLACES EXISTING REVENUE RECOGNITION GUIDANCE. AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE UPDATED GUIDANCE REQUIRES COMPANIES TO RECOGNIZE REVENUE IN A WAY THAT DEPICTS THE TRANSFER OF PROMISED GOODS OR SERVICES TO CUSTOMERS IN AN AMOUNT THAT REFLECTS THE CONSIDERATION TO WHICH THE ENTITY EXPECTS TO BE ENTITLED IN EXCHANGE FOR THOSE GOODS OR SERVICES. THE NEW GUIDANCE IS EFFECTIVE FOR THE COMPANY BEGINNING JUNE 1, 2017. THE COMPANY IS CURRENTLY EVALUATING THE EFFECT THE GUIDANCE WILL HAVE ON THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

WAS

BASIS POINTS LOWER THAN THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS FOR THE YEAR ENDED

MAY 31, 2013

PRIMARILY DUE TO AN INCREASE IN THE AMOUNT OF EARNINGS FROM LOWER TAX RATE JURISDICTIONS.

DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED

MAY 31, 2014

, THE COMPANY REACHED A RESOLUTION WITH THE IRS ON A U.S. UNILATERAL ADVANCED PRICING AGREEMENT THAT COVERS INTERCOMPANY TRANSFER PRICING FOR FISCAL YEARS 2011 THROUGH 2020. THIS AGREEMENT RESULTED IN A REDUCTION IN THE COMPANY'S PERMANENTLY REINVESTED FOREIGN EARNINGS, WHICH INCREASED THE EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE AND INCOME TAXES PAYABLE. THE AGREEMENT ALSO RESULTED IN A REDUCTION OF PREVIOUSLY UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS AND THE CREATION OF A DEFERRED TAX CHARGE, BOTH OF WHICH REDUCED THE EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE. THE NET RESULT OF THE AGREEMENT DID NOT HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE COMPANY’S EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE IN FISCAL 2014.

THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS FOR THE YEAR ENDED

MAY 31, 2013

WAS

30

BASIS POINTS LOWER THAN THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS FOR THE YEAR ENDED

MAY 31, 2012

PRIMARILY DUE TO TAX BENEFITS RECEIVED FROM THE INTERCOMPANY SALE OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS OUTSIDE OF THE U.S., THE RETROACTIVE REINSTATEMENT OF THE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT CREDIT AND THE INTRA-PERIOD ALLOCATION OF TAX EXPENSE BETWEEN CONTINUING OPERATIONS, DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS AND OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME. THE DECREASE IN THE EFFECTIVE RATE WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A HIGHER EFFECTIVE TAX RATE ON OPERATIONS AS A RESULT OF AN INCREASE IN EARNINGS IN HIGHER TAX JURISDICTIONS.

DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED

MAY 31, 2014

, THE COMPANY REACHED A RESOLUTION WITH THE IRS ON A U.S. UNILATERAL ADVANCED PRICING AGREEMENT THAT COVERS INTERCOMPANY TRANSFER PRICING FOR FISCAL YEARS 2011 THROUGH 2020. AS A RESULT, THE COMPANY RECORDED A GROSS INCREASE IN UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS RELATED TO PRIOR PERIOD TAX POSITIONS, A GROSS DECREASE IN UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS RELATED TO PRIOR PERIOD TAX POSITIONS, AND A SETTLEMENT. THE NET IMPACT OF THESE ITEMS RESULTED IN A DECREASE TO UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS.

AS OF

MAY 31, 2014

, THE TOTAL GROSS UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS, EXCLUDING RELATED INTEREST AND PENALTIES, WERE

$506 MILLION

,

$264 MILLION

OF WHICH WOULD AFFECT THE COMPANY'S EFFECTIVE TAX RATE IF RECOGNIZED IN FUTURE PERIODS.

THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES INTEREST AND PENALTIES RELATED TO INCOME TAX MATTERS IN INCOME TAX EXPENSE. THE LIABILITY FOR PAYMENT OF INTEREST AND PENALTIES INCREASED

$55 MILLION

,

$4 MILLION

, AND

$17 MILLION

DURING THE YEARS ENDED

MAY 31, 2014

,

2013

, AND

2012

, RESPECTIVELY. AS OF

MAY 31, 2014

AND

2013

, ACCRUED INTEREST AND PENALTIES RELATED TO UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS WERE

$167 MILLION

AND

$112 MILLION

, RESPECTIVELY (EXCLUDING FEDERAL BENEFIT).

THE COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO TAXATION PRIMARILY IN THE UNITED STATES, CHINA, THE NETHERLANDS, AND BRAZIL, AS WELL AS VARIOUS STATE AND OTHER FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS. THE COMPANY HAS CONCLUDED SUBSTANTIALLY ALL U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX MATTERS THROUGH FISCAL 2010. THE COMPANY IS CURRENTLY UNDER AUDIT BY THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE FOR THE

2011 THROUGH 2014

TAX YEARS, AND MANY ISSUES ARE AT AN ADVANCED STAGE IN THE EXAMINATION PROCESS. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY IS IN APPEALS REGARDING THE VALIDATION OF FOREIGN TAX CREDITS TAKEN. THE COMPANY’S MAJOR FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS, CHINA, THE NETHERLANDS AND BRAZIL, HAVE CONCLUDED SUBSTANTIALLY ALL INCOME TAX MATTERS THROUGH CALENDAR 2005, FISCAL 2008 AND CALENDAR 2008, RESPECTIVELY. ALTHOUGH THE TIMING OF RESOLUTION OF AUDITS IS NOT CERTAIN, THE COMPANY EVALUATES ALL DOMESTIC AND FOREIGN AUDIT ISSUES IN THE AGGREGATE, ALONG WITH THE EXPIRATION OF APPLICABLE STATUTES OF LIMITATIONS, AND ESTIMATES THAT IT IS REASONABLY POSSIBLE THE TOTAL GROSS UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS COULD DECREASE BY UP TO

$70 MILLION

WITHIN THE NEXT 12 MONTHS.

THE COMPANY PROVIDES FOR U.S. INCOME TAXES ON THE UNDISTRIBUTED EARNINGS OF FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES UNLESS THEY ARE CONSIDERED INDEFINITELY REINVESTED OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES. AT

MAY 31, 2014

, THE INDEFINITELY REINVESTED EARNINGS IN FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES UPON WHICH UNITED STATES INCOME TAXES HAVE NOT BEEN PROVIDED WAS APPROXIMATELY

$6.6 BILLION

, WHICH INCLUDES A REDUCTION OF PERMANENTLY REINVESTED EARNINGS FOR THE YEAR ENDED

MAY 31, 2014

. IF THESE UNDISTRIBUTED EARNINGS WERE REPATRIATED TO THE UNITED STATES, OR IF THE SHARES OF THE RELEVANT FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES WERE SOLD OR OTHERWISE TRANSFERRED, THEY WOULD GENERATE FOREIGN TAX CREDITS THAT WOULD REDUCE THE FEDERAL TAX LIABILITY ASSOCIATED WITH THE FOREIGN DIVIDEND OR THE OTHERWISE TAXABLE TRANSACTION. ASSUMING A FULL UTILIZATION OF THE FOREIGN TAX CREDITS, THE POTENTIAL NET DEFERRED TAX LIABILITY ASSOCIATED WITH THESE TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES OF UNDISTRIBUTED EARNINGS WOULD BE APPROXIMATELY

$2.1 BILLION

ON FEBRUARY 1, 2013, THE COMPANY COMPLETED THE SALE OF COLE HAAN TO APAX PARTNERS FOR AN AGREED UPON PURCHASE PRICE OF

$570 MILLION

AND RECEIVED AT CLOSING

$561 MILLION

, NET OF

$9 MILLION

OF PURCHASE PRICE ADJUSTMENTS. THE TRANSACTION RESULTED IN A GAIN ON SALE OF

$231 MILLION

, NET OF

$137 MILLION

IN INCOME TAX EXPENSE; THIS GAIN IS INCLUDED IN THE NET INCOME (LOSS) FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS LINE ITEM ON THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME. THERE WERE NO ADJUSTMENTS TO THESE RECORDED AMOUNTS AS OF

MAY 31, 2014

. BEGINNING NOVEMBER 30, 2012, THE COMPANY CLASSIFIED THE COLE HAAN DISPOSAL GROUP AS HELD-FOR-SALE AND PRESENTED THE RESULTS OF COLE HAAN'S OPERATIONS IN THE NET INCOME (LOSS) FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS LINE ITEM ON THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME. FROM THIS DATE UNTIL THE SALE, THE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES OF COLE HAAN WERE RECORDED IN THE ASSETS OF DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS AND LIABILITIES OF DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS LINE ITEMS ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS, RESPECTIVELY. PREVIOUSLY, THESE AMOUNTS WERE REPORTED IN THE COMPANY'S SEGMENT PRESENTATION AS “OTHER BUSINESSES.”

UNDER THE SALE AGREEMENT, THE COMPANY AGREED TO PROVIDE CERTAIN TRANSITION SERVICES TO COLE HAAN FOR AN EXPECTED PERIOD OF

3

TO

9

MONTHS FROM THE DATE OF SALE. THESE SERVICES WERE ESSENTIALLY COMPLETE AS OF MAY 31, 2013 AND THE COMPANY HAS HAD NO SIGNIFICANT INVOLVEMENT WITH COLE HAAN BEYOND THE TRANSITION SERVICES. THE COMPANY HAS ALSO LICENSED NIKE PROPRIETARY AIR AND LUNAR TECHNOLOGIES TO COLE HAAN FOR A TRANSITION PERIOD. THE CONTINUING CASH FLOWS RELATED TO THESE ITEMS ARE NOT SIGNIFICANT TO COLE HAAN. ADDITIONALLY, PREEXISTING GUARANTEES OF CERTAIN COLE HAAN LEASE PAYMENTS REMAINED IN PLACE AFTER THE SALE; THE MAXIMUM EXPOSURE UNDER THE GUARANTEES IS $33 MILLION

AT

MAY 31, 2014

. THE FAIR VALUE OF THE GUARANTEES IS NOT MATERIAL.

ON NOVEMBER 30, 2012, THE COMPANY COMPLETED THE SALE OF CERTAIN ASSETS OF UMBRO TO ICONIX BRAND GROUP (“ICONIX”) FOR $225 MILLION

THE UMBRO DISPOSAL GROUP WAS CLASSIFIED AS HELD-FOR-SALE AS OF NOVEMBER 30, 2012 AND THE RESULTS OF UMBRO'S OPERATIONS ARE PRESENTED IN THE NET INCOME (LOSS) FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS LINE ITEM ON THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME. THE LIABILITIES OF UMBRO WERE RECORDED IN THE LIABILITIES OF DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS LINE ITEMS ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS. PREVIOUSLY, THESE AMOUNTS WERE REPORTED IN THE COMPANY'S SEGMENT PRESENTATION AS “OTHER BUSINESSES.” UPON MEETING THE HELD-FOR-SALE CRITERIA, THE COMPANY RECORDED A LOSS OF $107 MILLION

, NET OF TAX, ON THE SALE OF UMBRO AND THE LOSS IS INCLUDED IN THE NET INCOME (LOSS) FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS LINE ITEM ON THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME. THE LOSS ON SALE WAS CALCULATED AS THE NET SALES PRICE LESS UMBRO ASSETS OF $248 MILLION

, INCLUDING INTANGIBLES, GOODWILL, AND FIXED ASSETS, OTHER MISCELLANEOUS CHARGES OF $22 MILLION

, AND THE RELEASE OF THE ASSOCIATED CUMULATIVE TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENT OF $129 MILLION

. THE TAX BENEFIT ON THE LOSS WAS $67 MILLION

. THERE WERE NO ADJUSTMENTS TO THESE RECORDED AMOUNTS AS OF

MAY 31, 2014.

IN CONNECTION WITH VARIOUS CONTRACTS AND AGREEMENTS, THE COMPANY PROVIDES ROUTINE INDEMNIFICATION RELATING TO THE ENFORCEABILITY OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS, COVERAGE FOR LEGAL ISSUES THAT ARISE AND OTHER ITEMS WHERE THE COMPANY IS ACTING AS THE GUARANTOR. CURRENTLY, THE COMPANY HAS SEVERAL SUCH AGREEMENTS IN PLACE. HOWEVER, BASED ON THE COMPANY’S HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND THE ESTIMATED PROBABILITY OF FUTURE LOSS, THE COMPANY HAS DETERMINED THAT THE FAIR VALUE OF SUCH INDEMNIFICATION IS NOT MATERIAL TO THE COMPANY’S FINANCIAL POSITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF ITS BUSINESS, THE COMPANY IS INVOLVED IN VARIOUS LEGAL PROCEEDINGS INVOLVING CONTRACTUAL AND EMPLOYMENT RELATIONSHIPS, PRODUCT LIABILITY CLAIMS, TRADEMARK RIGHTS, AND A VARIETY OF OTHER MATTERS. WHILE THE COMPANY CANNOT PREDICT THE OUTCOME OF ITS PENDING LEGAL MATTERS WITH CERTAINTY, THE COMPANY DOES NOT BELIEVE ANY CURRENTLY IDENTIFIED CLAIM, PROCEEDING OR LITIGATION, EITHER INDIVIDUALLY OR IN AGGREGATE, WILL HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE COMPANY’S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL POSITION OR CASH FLOWS.

NOTE 17 — RISK MANAGEMENT AND DERIVATIVES

THE COMPANY IS EXPOSED TO GLOBAL MARKET RISKS, INCLUDING THE EFFECT OF CHANGES IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES AND INTEREST RATES, AND USES DERIVATIVES TO MANAGE FINANCIAL EXPOSURES THAT OCCUR IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS. THE COMPANY DOES NOT HOLD OR ISSUE DERIVATIVES FOR TRADING OR SPECULATIVE PURPOSES.

THE COMPANY MAY ELECT TO DESIGNATE CERTAIN DERIVATIVES AS HEDGING INSTRUMENTS UNDER THE ACCOUNTING STANDARDS FOR DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING. THE COMPANY FORMALLY DOCUMENTS ALL RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN DESIGNATED HEDGING INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGED ITEMS AS WELL AS ITS RISK MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVE AND STRATEGY FOR UNDERTAKING HEDGE TRANSACTIONS. THIS PROCESS INCLUDES LINKING ALL DERIVATIVES DESIGNATED AS HEDGES TO EITHER RECOGNIZED ASSETS OR LIABILITIES OR FORECASTED TRANSACTIONS.

THE MAJORITY OF DERIVATIVES OUTSTANDING AS OF

MAY 31, 2014

ARE DESIGNATED AS CASH FLOW OR FAIR VALUE HEDGES. ALL DERIVATIVES ARE RECOGNIZED ON THE BALANCE SHEET AT FAIR VALUE AND CLASSIFIED BASED ON THE INSTRUMENT’S MATURITY DATE. THE TOTAL NOTIONAL AMOUNT OF OUTSTANDING DERIVATIVES AS OF

MAY 31, 2014

WAS APPROXIMATELY

$12 BILLION

, WHICH PRIMARILY COMPRISES CASH FLOW HEDGES FOR EURO/U.S. DOLLAR, BRITISH POUND/EURO, AND JAPANESE YEN/U.S. DOLLAR CURRENCY PAIRS. AS OF

CASH FLOW HEDGES

THE PURPOSE OF THE COMPANY’S FOREIGN CURRENCY HEDGING ACTIVITIES IS TO REDUCE THE VOLATILITY OF THE COMPANY'S CASH FLOWS RESULTING FROM CHANGES IN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES. FOREIGN CURRENCY EXPOSURES THAT THE COMPANY MAY ELECT TO HEDGE IN THIS MANNER INCLUDE PRODUCT COST EXPOSURES, NON-FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY DENOMINATED EXTERNAL AND INTERCOMPANY REVENUES, SELLING AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES, INVESTMENTS IN U.S. DOLLAR-DENOMINATED AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE DEBT SECURITIES AND CERTAIN INTERCOMPANY TRANSACTIONS.

PRODUCT COST EXPOSURES ARE PRIMARILY GENERATED THROUGH NON-FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY DENOMINATED PRODUCT PURCHASES AND THE FOREIGN CURRENCY ADJUSTMENT PROGRAM DESCRIBED BELOW. NIKE ENTITIES PRIMARILY PURCHASE PRODUCTS IN TWO WAYS: (1) SOME NIKE ENTITIES PURCHASE PRODUCT FROM THE NIKE TRADING COMPANY (“NTC”), A WHOLLY-OWNED SOURCING HUB THAT BUYS NIKE BRANDED PRODUCTS FROM THIRD-PARTY FACTORIES, PREDOMINANTLY IN U.S. DOLLARS. THE NTC, WHOSE FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY IS THE U.S. DOLLAR, THEN SELLS THE PRODUCTS TO NIKE ENTITIES IN THEIR RESPECTIVE FUNCTIONAL CURRENCIES. WHEN THE NTC SELLS TO A NIKE ENTITY WITH A DIFFERENT FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY, THE RESULT IS A FOREIGN CURRENCY EXPOSURE FOR THE NTC; (2) OTHER NIKE ENTITIES PURCHASE PRODUCT DIRECTLY FROM THIRD-PARTY FACTORIES IN U.S. DOLLARS. THESE PURCHASES GENERATE A FOREIGN CURRENCY EXPOSURE FOR THOSE NIKE ENTITIES WITH A FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY OTHER THAN THE U.S. DOLLAR.

IN JANUARY 2012, THE COMPANY IMPLEMENTED A FOREIGN CURRENCY ADJUSTMENT PROGRAM WITH CERTAIN FACTORIES. THE PROGRAM IS DESIGNED TO MORE EFFECTIVELY MANAGE FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK BY ASSUMING CERTAIN OF THE FACTORIES’ FOREIGN CURRENCY EXPOSURES, SOME OF WHICH ARE NATURAL OFFSETS TO THE COMPANY'S EXISTING FOREIGN CURRENCY EXPOSURES. UNDER THIS PROGRAM, THE COMPANY’S PAYMENTS TO THESE FACTORIES ARE ADJUSTED FOR RATE FLUCTUATIONS IN THE BASKET OF CURRENCIES (“FACTORY CURRENCY EXPOSURE INDEX”) IN WHICH THE LABOR, MATERIALS AND OVERHEAD COSTS INCURRED BY THE FACTORIES IN THE PRODUCTION OF NIKE BRANDED PRODUCTS (“FACTORY INPUT COSTS”) ARE DENOMINATED. FOR THE PORTION OF THE INDICES DENOMINATED IN THE LOCAL OR FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY OF THE FACTORY, THE COMPANY MAY ELECT TO PLACE FORMALLY DESIGNATED CASH FLOW HEDGES. FOR ALL CURRENCIES WITHIN THE INDICES, EXCLUDING THE U.S. DOLLAR AND THE LOCAL OR FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY OF THE FACTORY, AN EMBEDDED DERIVATIVE CONTRACT IS CREATED UPON THE FACTORY’S ACCEPTANCE OF NIKE’S PURCHASE ORDER. EMBEDDED DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS ARE SEPARATED FROM THE RELATED PURCHASE ORDER AND THEIR ACCOUNTING TREATMENT IS DESCRIBED FURTHER BELOW.

THE COMPANY’S POLICY PERMITS THE UTILIZATION OF DERIVATIVES TO REDUCE ITS FOREIGN CURRENCY EXPOSURES WHERE INTERNAL NETTING OR OTHER STRATEGIES CANNOT BE EFFECTIVELY EMPLOYED. HEDGED TRANSACTIONS ARE DENOMINATED PRIMARILY IN EUROS, BRITISH POUNDS AND JAPANESE YEN. TYPICALLY THE COMPANY MAY ENTER INTO HEDGE CONTRACTS STARTING

12

TO

24

MONTHS IN ADVANCE OF THE FORECASTED TRANSACTION AND MAY PLACE INCREMENTAL HEDGES UP TO

100%

OF THE EXPOSURE BY THE TIME THE FORECASTED TRANSACTION OCCURS.

ALL CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF DERIVATIVES DESIGNATED AS CASH FLOW HEDGES, EXCLUDING ANY INEFFECTIVE PORTION, ARE RECORDED IN OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME UNTIL NET INCOME IS AFFECTED BY THE VARIABILITY OF CASH FLOWS OF THE HEDGED TRANSACTION. IN MOST CASES, AMOUNTS RECORDED IN OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME WILL BE RELEASED TO NET INCOME SOMETIME AFTER THE MATURITY OF THE RELATED DERIVATIVE. EFFECTIVE HEDGE RESULTS ARE CLASSIFIED WITHIN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME IN THE SAME MANNER AS THE UNDERLYING EXPOSURE, WITH THE RESULTS OF HEDGES OF NON-FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY DENOMINATED REVENUES AND PRODUCT COST EXPOSURES, EXCLUDING EMBEDDED DERIVATIVES AS DESCRIBED BELOW, RECORDED IN REVENUES OR COST OF SALES, WHEN THE UNDERLYING HEDGED TRANSACTION AFFECTS CONSOLIDATED NET INCOME. RESULTS OF HEDGES OF SELLING AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE ARE RECORDED TOGETHER WITH THOSE COSTS WHEN THE RELATED EXPENSE IS RECORDED. RESULTS OF HEDGES OF ANTICIPATED PURCHASES AND SALES OF U.S. DOLLAR-DENOMINATED AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE SECURITIES ARE RECORDED IN

OTHER EXPENSE (INCOME), NET

WHEN THE SECURITIES ARE SOLD. RESULTS OF HEDGES OF CERTAIN ANTICIPATED INTERCOMPANY TRANSACTIONS ARE RECORDED IN

OTHER EXPENSE (INCOME), NET

WHEN THE TRANSACTION OCCURS. THE COMPANY CLASSIFIES THE CASH FLOWS AT SETTLEMENT FROM THESE DESIGNATED CASH FLOW HEDGE DERIVATIVES IN THE SAME CATEGORY AS THE CASH FLOWS FROM THE RELATED HEDGED ITEMS, GENERALLY WITHIN THE CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATIONS COMPONENT OF THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS.

PREMIUMS PAID ON OPTIONS ARE INITIALLY RECORDED AS DEFERRED CHARGES. THE COMPANY ASSESSES THE EFFECTIVENESS OF OPTIONS BASED ON THE TOTAL CASH FLOWS METHOD AND RECORDS TOTAL CHANGES IN THE OPTIONS’ FAIR VALUE TO OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME TO THE DEGREE THEY ARE EFFECTIVE.

THE COMPANY FORMALLY ASSESSES, BOTH AT A HEDGE’S INCEPTION AND ON AN ONGOING BASIS, WHETHER THE DERIVATIVES THAT ARE USED IN THE HEDGING TRANSACTION HAVE BEEN HIGHLY EFFECTIVE IN OFFSETTING CHANGES IN THE CASH FLOWS OF HEDGED ITEMS AND WHETHER THOSE DERIVATIVES MAY BE EXPECTED TO REMAIN HIGHLY EFFECTIVE IN FUTURE PERIODS. EFFECTIVENESS FOR CASH FLOW HEDGES IS ASSESSED BASED ON CHANGES IN FORWARD RATES. INEFFECTIVENESS WAS

IMMATERIAL

FOR THE YEARS ENDED

MAY 31, 2014

,

2013

, AND

2012.

THE COMPANY DISCONTINUES HEDGE ACCOUNTING PROSPECTIVELY WHEN (1) IT DETERMINES THAT THE DERIVATIVE IS NO LONGER HIGHLY EFFECTIVE IN OFFSETTING CHANGES IN THE CASH FLOWS OF A HEDGED ITEM (INCLUDING HEDGED ITEMS SUCH AS FIRM COMMITMENTS OR FORECASTED TRANSACTIONS); (2) THE DERIVATIVE EXPIRES OR IS SOLD, TERMINATED, OR EXERCISED; (3) IT IS NO LONGER PROBABLE THAT THE FORECASTED TRANSACTION WILL OCCUR; OR (4) MANAGEMENT DETERMINES THAT DESIGNATING THE DERIVATIVE AS A HEDGING INSTRUMENT IS NO LONGER APPROPRIATE.

WHEN THE COMPANY DISCONTINUES HEDGE ACCOUNTING BECAUSE IT IS NO LONGER PROBABLE THAT THE FORECASTED TRANSACTION WILL OCCUR IN THE ORIGINALLY EXPECTED PERIOD, BUT IS EXPECTED TO OCCUR WITHIN AN ADDITIONAL TWO-MONTH PERIOD OF TIME THEREAFTER, THE GAIN OR LOSS ON THE DERIVATIVE REMAINS IN ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME AND IS RECLASSIFIED TO NET INCOME WHEN THE FORECASTED TRANSACTION AFFECTS CONSOLIDATED NET INCOME. HOWEVER, IF IT IS PROBABLE THAT A FORECASTED TRANSACTION WILL NOT OCCUR BY THE END OF THE ORIGINALLY SPECIFIED TIME PERIOD OR WITHIN AN ADDITIONAL TWO-MONTH PERIOD OF TIME THEREAFTER, THE GAINS AND LOSSES THAT WERE ACCUMULATED IN OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME WILL BE RECOGNIZED IMMEDIATELY IN

OTHER EXPENSE (INCOME), NET

. IN ALL SITUATIONS IN WHICH HEDGE ACCOUNTING IS DISCONTINUED AND THE DERIVATIVE REMAINS OUTSTANDING, THE COMPANY WILL CARRY THE DERIVATIVE AT ITS FAIR VALUE ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS, RECOGNIZING FUTURE CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE IN

OTHER EXPENSE (INCOME), NET

. FOR THE YEARS ENDED

MAY 31, 2014

,

2013

, AND

2012

, THE AMOUNTS RECORDED IN

OTHER EXPENSE (INCOME), NET

AS A RESULT OF THE DISCONTINUANCE OF CASH FLOW HEDGING BECAUSE THE FORECASTED TRANSACTION WAS NO LONGER PROBABLE OF OCCURRING WERE

IMMATERIAL.

AS OF

MAY 31, 2014

,

$10 MILLION

OF DEFERRED NET GAINS (NET OF TAX) ON BOTH OUTSTANDING AND MATURED DERIVATIVES ACCUMULATED IN OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME ARE EXPECTED TO BE RECLASSIFIED TO NET INCOME DURING THE NEXT 12 MONTHS CONCURRENT WITH THE UNDERLYING HEDGED TRANSACTIONS ALSO BEING RECORDED IN NET INCOME. ACTUAL AMOUNTS ULTIMATELY RECLASSIFIED TO NET INCOME ARE DEPENDENT ON THE EXCHANGE RATES IN EFFECT WHEN DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS THAT ARE CURRENTLY OUTSTANDING MATURE. AS OF

MAY 31, 2014

, THE MAXIMUM TERM OVER WHICH THE COMPANY IS HEDGING EXPOSURES TO THE VARIABILITY OF CASH FLOWS FOR ITS FORECASTED TRANSACTIONS IS

24

MONTHS.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

FAIR VALUE HEDGES

THE COMPANY IS ALSO EXPOSED TO THE RISK OF CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF CERTAIN FIXED-RATE DEBT ATTRIBUTABLE TO CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES. DERIVATIVES CURRENTLY USED BY THE COMPANY TO HEDGE THIS RISK ARE RECEIVE-FIXED, PAY-VARIABLE INTEREST RATE SWAPS. AS OF

MAY 31, 2014

, ALL INTEREST RATE SWAP AGREEMENTS ARE DESIGNATED AS FAIR VALUE HEDGES OF THE RELATED LONG-TERM DEBT AND MEET THE SHORTCUT METHOD REQUIREMENTS UNDER THE ACCOUNTING STANDARDS FOR DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING. ACCORDINGLY, CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUES OF THE INTEREST RATE SWAP AGREEMENTS ARE CONSIDERED TO EXACTLY OFFSET CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE UNDERLYING LONG-TERM DEBT. THE CASH FLOWS ASSOCIATED WITH THE COMPANY’S FAIR VALUE HEDGES ARE PERIODIC INTEREST PAYMENTS WHILE THE SWAPS ARE OUTSTANDING, WHICH ARE REFLECTED WITHIN THE CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATIONS COMPONENT OF THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS. THE COMPANY RECORDED

NO

INEFFECTIVENESS FROM ITS INTEREST RATE SWAPS DESIGNATED AS FAIR VALUE HEDGES FOR THE YEARS ENDED

MAY 31, 2014

2013

, OR

2012.

NET INVESTMENT HEDGES

THE COMPANY HAS HEDGED AND MAY, IN THE FUTURE, HEDGE THE RISK OF VARIABILITY IN FOREIGN-CURRENCY-DENOMINATED NET INVESTMENTS IN WHOLLY-OWNED INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS. ALL CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE OF THE DERIVATIVES DESIGNATED AS NET INVESTMENT HEDGES, EXCEPT INEFFECTIVE PORTIONS, ARE REPORTED IN THE CUMULATIVE TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENT COMPONENT OF OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME ALONG WITH THE FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENTS ON THOSE INVESTMENTS. THE COMPANY CLASSIFIES THE CASH FLOWS AT SETTLEMENT OF ITS NET INVESTMENT HEDGES WITHIN THE CASH (USED) PROVIDED BY INVESTING ACTIVITIES COMPONENT OF THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS. THE COMPANY ASSESSES HEDGE EFFECTIVENESS BASED ON CHANGES IN FORWARD RATES. THE COMPANY RECORDED

NO

INEFFECTIVENESS FROM ITS NET INVESTMENT HEDGES FOR THE YEARS ENDED

,

2013

, OR

2012.

EMBEDDED DERIVATIVES

AS PART OF THE FOREIGN CURRENCY ADJUSTMENT PROGRAM DESCRIBED ABOVE, AN EMBEDDED DERIVATIVE CONTRACT IS CREATED UPON THE FACTORY'S ACCEPTANCE OF NIKE'S PURCHASE ORDER FOR CURRENCIES WITHIN THE FACTORY CURRENCY EXPOSURE INDICES THAT ARE NEITHER THE U.S. DOLLAR NOR THE LOCAL OR FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY OF THE FACTORY. EMBEDDED DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS ARE TREATED AS FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS THAT ARE BIFURCATED FROM THE RELATED PURCHASE ORDER AND RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE AS A DERIVATIVE ASSET OR LIABILITY ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS WITH THEIR CORRESPONDING CHANGE IN FAIR VALUE RECOGNIZED IN

OTHER EXPENSE (INCOME), NET

FROM THE DATE A PURCHASE ORDER IS ACCEPTED BY A FACTORY THROUGH THE DATE THE PURCHASE PRICE IS NO LONGER SUBJECT TO FOREIGN CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS. AT

MAY 31, 2014

, THE NOTIONAL AMOUNT OF EMBEDDED DERIVATIVES WAS APPROXIMATELY

$100 MILLION.

UNDESIGNATED DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS

THE COMPANY MAY ELECT TO ENTER INTO FOREIGN EXCHANGE FORWARDS TO MITIGATE THE CHANGE IN FAIR VALUE OF SPECIFIC ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS AND/OR THE EMBEDDED DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS EXPLAINED ABOVE. THESE FORWARDS ARE NOT DESIGNATED AS HEDGING INSTRUMENTS UNDER THE ACCOUNTING STANDARDS FOR DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING. ACCORDINGLY, THESE UNDESIGNATED INSTRUMENTS ARE RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE AS A DERIVATIVE ASSET OR LIABILITY ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS WITH THEIR CORRESPONDING CHANGE IN FAIR VALUE RECOGNIZED IN

OTHER EXPENSE (INCOME), NET

, TOGETHER WITH THE RE-MEASUREMENT GAIN OR LOSS FROM THE HEDGED BALANCE SHEET POSITION OR EMBEDDED DERIVATIVE CONTRACT. THE COMPANY CLASSIFIES THE CASH FLOWS AT SETTLEMENT FROM UNDESIGNATED INSTRUMENTS IN THE SAME CATEGORY AS THE CASH FLOWS FROM THE RELATED HEDGED ITEMS, GENERALLY WITHIN THE CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATIONS COMPONENT OF THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS.

CREDIT RISK

THE COMPANY IS EXPOSED TO CREDIT-RELATED LOSSES IN THE EVENT OF NON-PERFORMANCE BY COUNTERPARTIES TO HEDGING INSTRUMENTS. THE COUNTERPARTIES TO ALL DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS ARE MAJOR FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS WITH INVESTMENT GRADE CREDIT RATINGS. HOWEVER, THIS DOES NOT ELIMINATE THE COMPANY’S EXPOSURE TO CREDIT RISK WITH THESE INSTITUTIONS. THIS CREDIT RISK IS LIMITED TO THE UNREALIZED GAINS IN SUCH CONTRACTS SHOULD ANY OF THESE COUNTERPARTIES FAIL TO PERFORM AS CONTRACTED. TO MANAGE THIS RISK, THE COMPANY HAS ESTABLISHED STRICT COUNTERPARTY CREDIT GUIDELINES THAT ARE CONTINUALLY MONITORED.

THE COMPANY’S DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS CONTAIN CREDIT RISK RELATED CONTINGENT FEATURES DESIGNED TO PROTECT AGAINST SIGNIFICANT DETERIORATION IN COUNTERPARTIES’ CREDITWORTHINESS AND THEIR ULTIMATE ABILITY TO SETTLE OUTSTANDING DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS. THE COMPANY’S BILATERAL CREDIT RELATED CONTINGENT FEATURES GENERALLY REQUIRE THE OWING ENTITY, EITHER THE COMPANY OR THE DERIVATIVE COUNTERPARTY, TO POST COLLATERAL FOR THE PORTION OF THE FAIR VALUE IN EXCESS OF

$50 MILLION

SHOULD THE FAIR VALUE OF OUTSTANDING DERIVATIVES TO EITHER COUNTERPARTY BE GREATER THAN

$50 MILLION

. ADDITIONALLY, A CERTAIN LEVEL OF DECLINE IN CREDIT RATING OF EITHER THE COMPANY OR THE COUNTERPARTY COULD ALSO TRIGGER COLLATERAL REQUIREMENTS. AS OF

MAY 31, 2014

, THE COMPANY WAS IN COMPLIANCE WITH ALL CREDIT RISK RELATED CONTINGENT FEATURES AND THE FAIR VALUE OF ITS DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS WITH CREDIT RISK RELATED CONTINGENT FEATURES IN A NET LIABILITY POSITION WAS

$22 MILLION

. ACCORDINGLY, THE COMPANY WAS NOT REQUIRED TO POST ANY COLLATERAL AS A RESULT OF THESE CONTINGENT FEATURES. FURTHER, AS OF

MAY 31, 2014

THOSE COUNTERPARTIES WHICH WERE REQUIRED TO POST COLLATERAL COMPLIED WITH SUCH REQUIREMENTS. GIVEN THE CONSIDERATIONS DESCRIBED ABOVE, THE COMPANY CONSIDERS THE IMPACT OF THE RISK OF COUNTERPARTY DEFAULT TO BE

IMMATERIAL.

NOTE 18 — OPERATING SEGMENTS AND RELATED INFORMATION

THE COMPANY’S OPERATING SEGMENTS ARE EVIDENCE OF THE STRUCTURE OF THE COMPANY'S INTERNAL ORGANIZATION. THE COMPANY'S OPERATING SEGMENTS HAVE CHANGED BEGINNING IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2014 TO MIRROR THE CHANGES IN THE STRUCTURE OF THE COMPANY’S INTERNAL ORGANIZATION THAT WERE EFFECTIVE DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2014. THE NIKE BRAND SEGMENTS CONTINUE TO BE DEFINED BY GEOGRAPHIC REGIONS FOR OPERATIONS PARTICIPATING IN NIKE BRAND SALES ACTIVITY AND ALSO INCLUDE THE RESULTS OF NIKE GOLF AND HURLEY, WHICH ARE NOW MANAGED WITHIN THE GEOGRAPHIES. PREVIOUSLY, NIKE GOLF AND HURLEY WERE COMBINED WITH CONVERSE AND REPORTED AS "OTHER BUSINESSES."

EACH NIKE BRAND GEOGRAPHIC SEGMENT OPERATES PREDOMINANTLY IN ONE INDUSTRY: THE DESIGN, DEVELOPMENT, MARKETING AND SELLING OF ATHLETIC FOOTWEAR, APPAREL, AND EQUIPMENT. THE COMPANY’S REPORTABLE OPERATING SEGMENTS FOR THE NIKE BRAND ARE: NORTH AMERICA, WESTERN EUROPE, CENTRAL & EASTERN EUROPE, GREATER CHINA, JAPAN, AND EMERGING MARKETS. THE COMPANY’S NIKE BRAND DIRECT TO CONSUMER OPERATIONS ARE MANAGED WITHIN EACH GEOGRAPHIC OPERATING SEGMENT. CONVERSE IS ALSO A REPORTABLE SEGMENT FOR NIKE, INC., AND OPERATES IN ONE INDUSTRY: THE DESIGN, MARKETING, LICENSING, AND SELLING OF CASUAL SNEAKERS, APPAREL, AND ACCESSORIES. PRIOR PERIOD SEGMENT INFORMATION HAS BEEN RESTATED TO REFLECT THESE CHANGES.

GLOBAL BRAND DIVISIONS IS INCLUDED WITHIN THE NIKE BRAND FOR PRESENTATION PURPOSES TO ALIGN WITH THE WAY MANAGEMENT VIEWS THE COMPANY. GLOBAL BRAND DIVISIONS PRIMARILY REPRESENT NIKE BRAND LICENSING BUSINESSES THAT ARE NOT PART OF A GEOGRAPHIC OPERATING SEGMENT, DEMAND CREATION EXPENSE  AND OPERATING OVERHEAD EXPENSE THAT ARE CENTRALLY MANAGED FOR THE NIKE BRAND, AND COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT AND SUPPLY CHAIN OPERATIONS.

CORPORATE CONSISTS LARGELY OF UNALLOCATED GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES, INCLUDING EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH CENTRALLY MANAGED DEPARTMENTS, DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION RELATED TO THE COMPANY’S HEADQUARTERS, UNALLOCATED INSURANCE AND BENEFIT PROGRAMS, INCLUDING STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION, CERTAIN FOREIGN CURRENCY GAINS AND LOSSES, INCLUDING CERTAIN HEDGE GAINS AND LOSSES, CERTAIN CORPORATE ELIMINATIONS AND OTHER ITEMS.

THE PRIMARY FINANCIAL MEASURE USED BY THE COMPANY TO EVALUATE PERFORMANCE OF INDIVIDUAL OPERATING SEGMENTS IS EARNINGS BEFORE INTEREST AND TAXES (COMMONLY REFERRED TO AS “EBIT”), WHICH REPRESENTS NET INCOME BEFORE

INTEREST EXPENSE (INCOME), NET

AND INCOME TAX EXPENSE IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME. RECONCILING ITEMS FOR EBIT REPRESENT CORPORATE EXPENSE ITEMS THAT ARE NOT ALLOCATED TO THE OPERATING SEGMENTS FOR MANAGEMENT REPORTING.

AS PART OF THE COMPANY'S CENTRALLY MANAGED FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK MANAGEMENT PROGRAM, STANDARD FOREIGN CURRENCY RATES ARE ASSIGNED TWICE PER YEAR TO EACH NIKE BRAND ENTITY IN THE COMPANY'S GEOGRAPHIC OPERATING SEGMENTS AND TO CONVERSE. THESE RATES ARE SET APPROXIMATELY NINE MONTHS IN ADVANCE OF THE FUTURE SELLING SEASON BASED ON AVERAGE MARKET SPOT RATES IN THE CALENDAR MONTH PRECEDING THE DATE THEY ARE ESTABLISHED. INVENTORIES AND COST OF SALES FOR GEOGRAPHIC OPERATING SEGMENTS AND CONVERSE REFLECT USE OF THESE STANDARD RATES TO RECORD NON-FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY PRODUCT PURCHASES IN THE ENTITY’S FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY. DIFFERENCES BETWEEN ASSIGNED STANDARD FOREIGN CURRENCY RATES AND ACTUAL MARKET RATES ARE INCLUDED IN CORPORATE, TOGETHER WITH FOREIGN CURRENCY HEDGE GAINS AND LOSSES GENERATED FROM THE COMPANY'S CENTRALLY MANAGED FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK MANAGEMENT PROGRAM AND OTHER CONVERSION GAINS AND LOSSES.

ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, INVENTORIES AND PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT FOR OPERATING SEGMENTS ARE REGULARLY REVIEWED BY MANAGEMENT AND ARE THEREFORE PROVIDED BELOW. ADDITIONS TO LONG-LIVED ASSETS AS PRESENTED IN THE FOLLOWING TABLE REPRESENT CAPITAL EXPENDITURES.

CERTAIN PRIOR YEAR AMOUNTS HAVE BEEN RECLASSIFIED TO CONFORM TO FISCAL
