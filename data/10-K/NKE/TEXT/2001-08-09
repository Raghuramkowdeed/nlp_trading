PART I

ITEM 1. BUSINESS

GENERAL

NIKE, INC. WAS INCORPORATED IN 1968 UNDER THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF OREGON.

AS USED IN THIS REPORT, THE TERMS "WE", "US", "NIKE" AND THE "COMPANY" REFER TO

NIKE, INC. AND ITS PREDECESSORS, SUBSIDIARIES AND AFFILIATES, UNLESS THE CONTEXT

INDICATES OTHERWISE.

OUR PRINCIPAL BUSINESS ACTIVITY INVOLVES THE DESIGN, DEVELOPMENT AND

WORLDWIDE MARKETING OF HIGH QUALITY FOOTWEAR, APPAREL, EQUIPMENT, AND ACCESSORY

PRODUCTS. NIKE IS THE LARGEST SELLER OF ATHLETIC FOOTWEAR AND ATHLETIC APPAREL

IN THE WORLD. WE SELL OUR PRODUCTS TO APPROXIMATELY 17,000 RETAIL ACCOUNTS IN

THE UNITED STATES AND THROUGH A MIX OF INDEPENDENT DISTRIBUTORS, LICENSEES AND

SUBSIDIARIES IN APPROXIMATELY 140 COUNTRIES AROUND THE WORLD. VIRTUALLY ALL OF

OUR PRODUCTS ARE MANUFACTURED BY INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS. VIRTUALLY ALL FOOTWEAR

PRODUCTS ARE PRODUCED OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES, WHILE APPAREL PRODUCTS ARE

PRODUCED BOTH IN THE UNITED STATES AND ABROAD.

PRODUCTS

NIKE'S ATHLETIC FOOTWEAR PRODUCTS ARE DESIGNED PRIMARILY FOR SPECIFIC

ATHLETIC USE, ALTHOUGH A LARGE PERCENTAGE OF THE PRODUCTS ARE WORN FOR CASUAL OR

LEISURE PURPOSES. WE PLACE CONSIDERABLE EMPHASIS ON HIGH QUALITY CONSTRUCTION

AND INNOVATIVE DESIGN. RUNNING, BASKETBALL, CHILDREN'S, CROSS-TRAINING AND

WOMEN'S SHOES ARE CURRENTLY OUR TOP-SELLING PRODUCT CATEGORIES AND WE EXPECT

THEM TO CONTINUE TO LEAD IN PRODUCT SALES IN THE NEAR FUTURE. HOWEVER, WE ALSO

MARKET SHOES DESIGNED FOR OUTDOOR ACTIVITIES, TENNIS, GOLF, SOCCER, BASEBALL,

FOOTBALL, BICYCLING, VOLLEYBALL, WRESTLING, CHEERLEADING, AQUATIC ACTIVITIES,

HIKING, AND OTHER ATHLETIC AND RECREATIONAL USES.

WE SELL ACTIVE SPORTS APPAREL COVERING MOST OF THE ABOVE CATEGORIES,

ATHLETICALLY INSPIRED LIFESTYLE APPAREL, AS WELL AS ATHLETIC BAGS AND ACCESSORY

ITEMS. NIKE APPAREL AND ACCESSORIES ARE DESIGNED TO COMPLEMENT OUR ATHLETIC

FOOTWEAR PRODUCTS, FEATURE THE SAME TRADEMARKS AND ARE SOLD THROUGH THE SAME

MARKETING AND DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS. WE OFTEN MARKET FOOTWEAR, APPAREL AND

ACCESSORIES IN "COLLECTIONS" OF SIMILAR DESIGN OR FOR SPECIFIC PURPOSES. WE ALSO

MARKET APPAREL WITH LICENSED COLLEGE AND PROFESSIONAL TEAM AND LEAGUE LOGOS.

WE SELL A LINE OF PERFORMANCE EQUIPMENT UNDER THE NIKE BRAND NAME,

INCLUDING SPORT BALLS, TIMEPIECES, EYEWEAR, SKATES, BATS, GLOVES, AND OTHER

EQUIPMENT DESIGNED FOR SPORTS ACTIVITIES. WE ALSO HAVE AGREEMENTS FOR LICENSEES

TO PRODUCE AND SELL NIKE BRAND SWIMWEAR, WOMEN'S SPORTS BRAS, CYCLING APPAREL,

CHILDREN'S CLOTHING, POSTERS, SCHOOL SUPPLIES, AND ELECTRONIC MEDIA DEVICES.

WE ALSO SELL A LINE OF DRESS AND CASUAL FOOTWEAR AND ACCESSORIES FOR MEN,

WOMEN AND CHILDREN UNDER THE BRAND NAME COLE HAAN(R) THROUGH OUR WHOLLY-OWNED

SUBSIDIARY, COLE HAAN HOLDINGS INCORPORATED, HEADQUARTERED IN MAINE. WE ALSO

SELL SMALL AMOUNTS OF VARIOUS PLASTIC PRODUCTS TO OTHER MANUFACTURERS THROUGH

OUR WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARY, NIKE IHM, INC.

GREENLAND, NEW HAMPSHIRE, MANUFACTURES AND DISTRIBUTES ICE SKATES, SKATE BLADES,

IN-LINE ROLLER SKATES, PROTECTIVE GEAR, HOCKEY STICKS, AND HOCKEY JERSEYS AND

FINANCIAL INFORMATION ABOUT GEOGRAPHIC AND SEGMENT OPERATIONS APPEARS IN

NOTE 16 OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ON PAGE 41.

WE EXPERIENCE MODERATE FLUCTUATIONS IN AGGREGATE SALES VOLUME DURING THE

YEAR. HOWEVER, THE MIX OF PRODUCT SALES MAY VARY CONSIDERABLY FROM TIME TO TIME

AS A RESULT OF CHANGES IN SEASONAL AND GEOGRAPHIC DEMAND FOR PARTICULAR TYPES OF

FOOTWEAR, APPAREL, AND EQUIPMENT.

BECAUSE NIKE IS A CONSUMER PRODUCTS COMPANY, THE RELATIVE POPULARITY OF

VARIOUS SPORTS AND FITNESS ACTIVITIES AND CHANGING DESIGN TRENDS AFFECT THE

DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS. WE MUST THEREFORE RESPOND TO TRENDS AND SHIFTS IN

CONSUMER PREFERENCES BY ADJUSTING THE MIX OF EXISTING PRODUCT OFFERINGS,

DEVELOPING NEW PRODUCTS, STYLES AND CATEGORIES, AND INFLUENCING SPORTS AND

FITNESS PREFERENCES THROUGH AGGRESSIVE MARKETING. THIS IS A CONTINUING RISK.

FAILURE TO TIMELY AND ADEQUATELY RESPOND COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE AFFECT ON

OUR SALES AND PROFITABILITY.

UNITED STATES MARKET

DURING FISCAL 2001, SALES IN THE UNITED STATES ACCOUNTED FOR APPROXIMATELY

54 PERCENT OF TOTAL REVENUES, COMPARED TO 56 PERCENT IN FISCAL 2000 AND 57

PERCENT IN FISCAL 1999. WE SELL TO APPROXIMATELY 17,000 RETAIL ACCOUNTS IN THE

UNITED STATES. THE NIKE BRAND DOMESTIC RETAIL ACCOUNT BASE INCLUDES A MIX OF

DEPARTMENT STORES, FOOTWEAR STORES, SPORTING GOODS STORES, SKATING, TENNIS AND

GOLF SHOPS, AND OTHER RETAIL ACCOUNTS. DURING FISCAL YEAR 2001, OUR THREE

LARGEST CUSTOMERS ACCOUNTED FOR APPROXIMATELY 29 PERCENT OF NIKE BRAND SALES IN

THE UNITED STATES, AND 27 PERCENT OF TOTAL SALES IN THE UNITED STATES.

WE MAKE SUBSTANTIAL USE OF OUR "FUTURES" ORDERING PROGRAM, WHICH ALLOWS

RETAILERS TO ORDER FIVE TO SIX MONTHS IN ADVANCE OF DELIVERY WITH THE GUARANTEE

THAT 90 PERCENT OF THEIR ORDERS WILL BE DELIVERED WITHIN A SET TIME PERIOD AT A

FIXED PRICE. IN FISCAL YEAR 2001, 86 PERCENT OF OUR U.S. FOOTWEAR SHIPMENTS

(EXCLUDING COLE HAAN AND BAUER) WERE MADE UNDER THE FUTURES PROGRAM, COMPARED TO

90 PERCENT IN FISCAL 2000 AND 91 PERCENT IN FISCAL 1999. IN FISCAL 2001, 78

PERCENT OF OUR U.S. APPAREL SHIPMENTS WERE MADE UNDER THE FUTURES PROGRAM,

COMPARED TO 82 PERCENT IN FISCAL 2000, AND 80 PERCENT IN 1999.

WE UTILIZE 16 NIKE SALES OFFICES TO SOLICIT SALES IN THE UNITED STATES. WE

ALSO UTILIZE 30 INDEPENDENT SALES REPRESENTATIVES TO SELL SPECIALTY PRODUCTS FOR

GOLF, CYCLING, WATER SPORTS AND OUTDOOR ACTIVITIES. IN ADDITION, WE OPERATE THE

FOLLOWING RETAIL OUTLETS IN THE UNITED STATES.

NIKE'S DOMESTIC DISTRIBUTION CENTERS FOR FOOTWEAR ARE LOCATED IN BEAVERTON,

OREGON, WILSONVILLE, OREGON, MEMPHIS, TENNESSEE, AND GREENLAND, NEW HAMPSHIRE.

APPAREL PRODUCTS ARE SHIPPED FROM THE MEMPHIS DISTRIBUTION CENTER. COLE HAAN

FOOTWEAR AND BAUER NIKE HOCKEY PRODUCTS ARE DISTRIBUTED PRIMARILY FROM

GREENLAND, NEW HAMPSHIRE, AND LICENSED TEAM APPAREL IS SHIPPED FROM FOOTHILL

RANCH, CALIFORNIA.

INTERNATIONAL MARKETS

WE CURRENTLY MARKET OUR PRODUCTS IN APPROXIMATELY 140 COUNTRIES OUTSIDE OF

THE UNITED STATES THROUGH INDEPENDENT DISTRIBUTORS, LICENSEES, SUBSIDIARIES AND

BRANCH OFFICES. NON-U.S. SALES ACCOUNTED FOR 46 PERCENT OF TOTAL REVENUES IN

FISCAL 2001, COMPARED TO 44 PERCENT IN FISCAL 2000 AND 43 PERCENT IN FISCAL

1999. WE OPERATE 19 DISTRIBUTION CENTERS IN EUROPE, ASIA, AUSTRALIA, LATIN

AMERICA, AND CANADA, AND ALSO DISTRIBUTE THROUGH INDEPENDENT DISTRIBUTORS AND

LICENSEES. WE ESTIMATE THAT OUR PRODUCTS ARE SOLD THROUGH MORE THAN 30,000

RETAIL ACCOUNTS OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES. IN MANY COUNTRIES AND REGIONS,

INCLUDING JAPAN, CANADA, ASIA, LATIN AMERICA, AND EUROPE, WE HAVE A FUTURES

ORDERING PROGRAM FOR RETAILERS SIMILAR TO THE UNITED STATES FUTURES PROGRAM

DESCRIBED ABOVE. NIKE'S THREE LARGEST CUSTOMERS OUTSIDE OF THE U.S. ACCOUNTED

FOR APPROXIMATELY 10 PERCENT OF NON-U.S. SALES.

WE OPERATE 111 RETAIL OUTLETS OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES, WHICH ARE

COMPRISED OF NIKETOWNS, FACTORY STORES, EMPLOYEE STORES, AND COLE HAAN STORES.

INTERNATIONAL BRANCH OFFICES AND SUBSIDIARIES OF NIKE ARE LOCATED IN

ARGENTINA, AUSTRALIA, AUSTRIA, BELGIUM, BRAZIL, CANADA, CHILE, CROATIA, CZECH

REPUBLIC, DENMARK, FINLAND, FRANCE, GERMANY, HONG KONG, HUNGARY, INDONESIA,

INDIA, IRELAND, ITALY, JAPAN, KOREA, MALAYSIA, MEXICO, NEW ZEALAND, THE

NETHERLANDS, NORWAY, PEOPLES REPUBLIC OF CHINA, THE PHILIPPINES, POLAND,

PORTUGAL, SINGAPORE, SLOVENIA, SOUTH AFRICA, SPAIN, SWEDEN, SWITZERLAND, TAIWAN,

THAILAND, TURKEY, THE UNITED KINGDOM, AND VIETNAM.

SIGNIFICANT CUSTOMERS

VENATOR GROUP INC., WHICH OPERATES A CHAIN OF RETAIL STORES SPECIALIZING IN

ATHLETIC FOOTWEAR AND APPAREL, ACCOUNTED FOR APPROXIMATELY 12 PERCENT OF GLOBAL

NET SALES OF NIKE BRAND PRODUCTS DURING FISCAL 2001. NO OTHER CUSTOMER ACCOUNTED

FOR 10 PERCENT OR MORE OF OUR NET SALES DURING FISCAL 2001.

ORDERS

AS OF MAY 31, 2001, OUR WORLDWIDE FUTURES ORDERS FOR NIKE BRAND ATHLETIC

FOOTWEAR AND APPAREL TOTALED $4.3 BILLION, COMPARED TO $4.2 BILLION AS OF MAY

31, 2000. THESE ORDERS ARE SCHEDULED FOR DELIVERY FROM JUNE

3

6

THROUGH NOVEMBER OF 2001. BASED UPON HISTORICAL DATA, WE EXPECT THAT

APPROXIMATELY 95 PERCENT OF THESE ORDERS WILL BE FILLED IN THAT TIME PERIOD,

ALTHOUGH THE ORDERS MAY BE CANCELABLE.

PRODUCT RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

WE BELIEVE THAT OUR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS ARE A KEY FACTOR IN

OUR PAST AND FUTURE SUCCESS. TECHNICAL INNOVATION IN THE DESIGN OF FOOTWEAR,

APPAREL, AND ATHLETIC EQUIPMENT RECEIVE CONTINUED EMPHASIS AS NIKE STRIVES TO

PRODUCE PRODUCTS THAT REDUCE OR ELIMINATE INJURY, AID ATHLETIC PERFORMANCE AND

MAXIMIZE COMFORT.

IN ADDITION TO NIKE'S OWN STAFF OF SPECIALISTS IN THE AREAS OF

BIOMECHANICS, EXERCISE PHYSIOLOGY, ENGINEERING, INDUSTRIAL DESIGN AND RELATED

FIELDS, WE ALSO UTILIZE RESEARCH COMMITTEES AND ADVISORY BOARDS MADE UP OF

ATHLETES, COACHES, TRAINERS, EQUIPMENT MANAGERS, ORTHOPEDISTS, PODIATRISTS AND

OTHER EXPERTS WHO CONSULT WITH US AND REVIEW DESIGNS, MATERIALS AND CONCEPTS FOR

PRODUCT IMPROVEMENT. EMPLOYEE ATHLETES WEAR-TEST AND EVALUATE PRODUCTS DURING

THE DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT PROCESS.

MANUFACTURING

IN FISCAL 2001, APPROXIMATELY FIVE PERCENT OF TOTAL NIKE BRAND APPAREL

PRODUCTION FOR SALE TO THE UNITED STATES MARKET WAS MANUFACTURED IN THE UNITED

STATES BY INDEPENDENT CONTRACT MANUFACTURERS, MOST OF WHICH ARE LOCATED IN THE

SOUTHERN STATES. THE REMAINDER WAS MANUFACTURED BY INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS

LOCATED IN 28 COUNTRIES. MOST OF THIS APPAREL PRODUCTION OCCURRED IN BANGLADESH,

CHINA, HONG KONG, INDIA, INDONESIA, MALAYSIA, MEXICO, PAKISTAN, THE PHILIPPINES,

SRI LANKA, TAIWAN, AND THAILAND. SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR APPAREL PRODUCTION FOR

SALE TO THE INTERNATIONAL MARKET WAS MANUFACTURED OUTSIDE THE U.S. OUR LARGEST

SINGLE APPAREL SUPPLIER ACCOUNTED FOR APPROXIMATELY EIGHT PERCENT OF TOTAL

FISCAL 2001 APPAREL PRODUCTION.

VIRTUALLY ALL OF OUR FOOTWEAR IS PRODUCED OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES. IN

FISCAL 2001, CONTRACT SUPPLIERS IN THE FOLLOWING COUNTRIES MANUFACTURED THE

FOLLOWING PERCENTAGES OF TOTAL NIKE BRAND FOOTWEAR.

COUNTRY                             PERCENT

SOUTH KOREA.................................................     1

WE ALSO HAVE MANUFACTURING AGREEMENTS WITH INDEPENDENT FACTORIES IN ARGENTINA,

BRAZIL, MEXICO, SOUTH AFRICA, AND ZIMBABWE, TO MANUFACTURE FOOTWEAR FOR SALE

WITHIN THOSE COUNTRIES. OUR LARGEST SINGLE FOOTWEAR SUPPLIER ACCOUNTED FOR

APPROXIMATELY 6 PERCENT OF TOTAL FISCAL 2001 FOOTWEAR PRODUCTION.

THE PRINCIPAL MATERIALS USED IN OUR FOOTWEAR PRODUCTS ARE NATURAL AND

SYNTHETIC RUBBER, PLASTIC COMPOUNDS, FOAM CUSHIONING MATERIALS, NYLON, LEATHER,

CANVAS, AND POLYURETHANE FILMS USED TO MAKE AIR-SOLE CUSHIONING COMPONENTS. NIKE

IHM, INC., A WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARY OF NIKE, IS OUR SOLE SUPPLIER OF THE

AIR-SOLE CUSHIONING COMPONENTS USED IN FOOTWEAR. THE PRINCIPAL MATERIALS USED IN

OUR APPAREL PRODUCTS ARE NATURAL AND SYNTHETIC FABRICS AND THREADS, PLASTIC AND

METAL HARDWARE, AND SPECIALIZED PERFORMANCE FABRICS DESIGNED TO REPEL RAIN,

RETAIN HEAT, OR EFFICIENTLY TRANSPORT BODY MOISTURE. NIKE AND ITS CONTRACTORS

AND SUPPLIERS BUY RAW MATERIALS IN BULK. MOST RAW MATERIALS ARE AVAILABLE IN THE

COUNTRIES WHERE MANUFACTURING TAKES PLACE. WE HAVE THUS FAR EXPERIENCED LITTLE

DIFFICULTY IN SATISFYING OUR RAW MATERIAL REQUIREMENTS.

OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS ARE SUBJECT TO THE USUAL RISKS OF DOING

BUSINESS ABROAD, SUCH AS POSSIBLE REVALUATION OF CURRENCIES, EXPORT DUTIES,

QUOTAS, RESTRICTIONS ON THE TRANSFER OF FUNDS AND, IN CERTAIN PARTS OF THE

WORLD, POLITICAL INSTABILITY. SEE "TRADE LEGISLATION" BELOW. WE HAVE NOT, TO

DATE, BEEN MATERIALLY AFFECTED BY ANY SUCH RISK, BUT CANNOT PREDICT THE

LIKELIHOOD OF SUCH DEVELOPMENTS OCCURRING. WE BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE THE ABILITY

TO DEVELOP, OVER A PERIOD OF TIME, ADEQUATE ALTERNATIVE SOURCES OF SUPPLY FOR

THE PRODUCTS OBTAINED FROM

4

7

OUR PRESENT SUPPLIERS OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES. IF EVENTS PREVENTED US FROM

ACQUIRING PRODUCTS FROM OUR SUPPLIERS IN A PARTICULAR COUNTRY, OUR FOOTWEAR

OPERATIONS COULD BE TEMPORARILY DISRUPTED AND WE COULD EXPERIENCE AN ADVERSE

FINANCIAL IMPACT. HOWEVER, WE BELIEVE THAT WE COULD ELIMINATE ANY SUCH

DISRUPTION WITHIN A PERIOD OF NO MORE THAN 12 MONTHS, AND THAT ANY ADVERSE

IMPACT WOULD, THEREFORE, BE OF A SHORT-TERM NATURE. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR

PRINCIPAL COMPETITORS ARE SUBJECT TO SIMILAR RISKS.

ALL OF OUR PRODUCTS MANUFACTURED OVERSEAS AND IMPORTED INTO THE UNITED

STATES AND OTHER COUNTRIES ARE SUBJECT TO DUTIES COLLECTED BY CUSTOMS

AUTHORITIES. CUSTOMS INFORMATION SUBMITTED BY US IS ROUTINELY SUBJECT TO REVIEW

BY CUSTOMS AUTHORITIES. WE ARE UNABLE TO PREDICT WHETHER ADDITIONAL CUSTOMS

DUTIES, QUOTAS OR OTHER RESTRICTIONS MAY BE IMPOSED ON THE IMPORTATION OF OUR

PRODUCTS IN THE FUTURE. THE ENACTMENT OF ANY SUCH DUTIES, QUOTAS OR RESTRICTIONS

COULD RESULT IN INCREASES IN THE COST OF OUR PRODUCTS GENERALLY AND MIGHT

ADVERSELY AFFECT THE SALES OR PROFITABILITY OF NIKE AND THE IMPORTED FOOTWEAR

AND APPAREL INDUSTRY AS A WHOLE.

SINCE 1972, NISSHO IWAI AMERICAN CORPORATION ("NIAC"), A SUBSIDIARY OF

NISSHO IWAI CORPORATION, A LARGE JAPANESE TRADING COMPANY, HAS PERFORMED

SIGNIFICANT IMPORT-EXPORT FINANCING SERVICES FOR US. CURRENTLY, NIAC PROVIDES

SUCH FINANCING SERVICES WITH RESPECT TO MORE THAN 80 PERCENT OF THE NIKE

PRODUCTS SOLD OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES, EUROPE AND JAPAN. ANY FAILURE OF

NIAC TO PROVIDE THESE SERVICES COULD DISRUPT OUR ABILITY TO ACQUIRE PRODUCTS

FROM OUR SUPPLIERS AND TO DELIVER PRODUCTS TO OUR CUSTOMERS OUTSIDE OF THE

UNITED STATES, EUROPE AND JAPAN. IF PROLONGED, SUCH A DISRUPTION COULD RESULT IN

CANCELLED ORDERS THAT WOULD ADVERSELY AFFECT SALES AND PROFITABILITY. WE BELIEVE

THAT ANY SUCH DISRUPTION WOULD BE SHORT TERM IN DURATION DUE TO THE READY

AVAILABILITY OF ALTERNATIVE SOURCES OF FINANCING AT COMPETITIVE RATES. OUR

CURRENT AGREEMENTS WITH NIAC EXPIRE ON MAY 31, 2003.

TRADE LEGISLATION

OUR NON-U.S. OPERATIONS ARE SUBJECT TO THE USUAL RISKS OF DOING BUSINESS

ABROAD, SUCH AS THE IMPOSITION OF IMPORT QUOTAS OR ANTI-DUMPING DUTIES. IN 1994,

THE EUROPEAN UNION ("EU") COMMISSION IMPOSED QUOTAS ON CERTAIN TYPES OF FOOTWEAR

MANUFACTURED IN CHINA. THESE QUOTAS REPLACED NATIONAL QUOTAS THAT HAD PREVIOUSLY

BEEN IN EFFECT IN SEVERAL MEMBER STATES. FOOTWEAR DESIGNED FOR USE IN SPORTING

ACTIVITIES, MEETING CERTAIN TECHNICAL CRITERIA AND HAVING A CIF (COST, INSURANCE

AND FREIGHT) PRICE ABOVE 9 EUROS ("SPECIAL TECHNOLOGY ATHLETIC FOOTWEAR" OR

"STAF"), IS EXCLUDED FROM THE QUOTAS. AS A RESULT OF THE STAF EXCLUSION, AND THE

AMOUNT OF QUOTA MADE AVAILABLE TO US, THE QUOTAS HAVE NOT, TO DATE, HAD A

MATERIAL EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS.

IN 1995, THE EU COMMISSION, AT THE REQUEST OF EUROPEAN FOOTWEAR

MANUFACTURERS, INITIATED TWO ANTI-DUMPING INVESTIGATIONS COVERING FOOTWEAR

IMPORTED FROM THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA, INDONESIA AND THAILAND. AS A

RESULT, IN OCTOBER 1997 THE COMMISSION IMPOSED DEFINITIVE ANTI-DUMPING DUTIES ON

CERTAIN TEXTILE UPPER FOOTWEAR IMPORTED FROM CHINA AND INDONESIA. IN FEBRUARY

1998, THE COMMISSION IMPOSED DEFINITIVE ANTI-DUMPING DUTIES ON CERTAIN SYNTHETIC

AND LEATHER UPPER FOOTWEAR ORIGINATING IN CHINA, INDONESIA AND THAILAND. IN THE

CASE OF TEXTILE UPPER FOOTWEAR, THE ANTI-DUMPING DUTIES DO NOT COVER SPORTS

FOOTWEAR. IN THE CASE OF SYNTHETIC AND LEATHER UPPER FOOTWEAR, THE ANTI-DUMPING

DUTIES DO NOT COVER FOOTWEAR MEETING THE STAF TECHNICAL CRITERIA AND WITH A CIF

PRICE ABOVE 5.7 EUROS. AS A RESULT, THE ANTI-DUMPING DUTIES FOR SYNTHETIC AND

LEATHER UPPER FOOTWEAR APPLY ONLY TO LOW COST FOOTWEAR. IN OUR CASE, THESE

DUTIES PRIMARILY AFFECT CHILDREN'S SHOES AND LOW COST SANDALS. WHILE THE

EXCLUSIONS ARE SUBJECT TO SOME INTERPRETATION BY CUSTOMS AUTHORITIES, WE BELIEVE

THAT MOST OF OUR FOOTWEAR SOURCED IN THE TARGET COUNTRIES FOR SALE IN THE EU

FITS WITHIN THE EXCLUSIONS. WE HAVE ALSO SHIFTED THE PRODUCTION OF THESE TYPES

OF FOOTWEAR TO OTHER COUNTRIES. ACCORDINGLY, THE ANTI-DUMPING DUTIES HAVE NOT

HAD A MATERIAL EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS.

WHILE WE HAVE NO REASON TO BELIEVE THAT THE SPORTS FOOTWEAR EXCLUSIONS FROM

THE QUOTAS (WHICH WILL REMAIN IN PLACE THROUGH 2004) AND ANTI-DUMPING DUTIES

WILL BE ELIMINATED, THE EU COMMISSION IN JUNE 2000 ISSUED AN AMENDMENT TO THE

EXPLANATORY NOTES TO THE EU'S CUSTOMS NOMENCLATURE ("CN"). THE AMENDMENT, WHICH

IS NOT LEGALLY BINDING, INTERPRETS SOME OF THE TECHNICAL CRITERIA FOR THE STAF

EXCLUSION AND THE FOOTWEAR TYPES THAT CAN BE CLASSIFIED AS FOR USE IN SPORTING

ACTIVITY. THE AMENDMENT COULD RESTRICT THE SCOPE OF THE STAF EXCLUSION FROM THE

QUOTAS AND ALSO THE SPORTS FOOTWEAR EXCLUSIONS FROM THE TWO EU ANTI-DUMPING

MEASURES. IN ADDITION, THE COMMISSION HAS ALTERED ITS ADMINISTRATION OF THE

QUOTA SYSTEM IN A MANNER THAT

5

8

WOULD PRECLUDE NATIONAL CUSTOMS AUTHORITIES FROM OPTING TO GRANT THE EXCLUSION

TO CERTAIN OTHER FOOTWEAR TYPES, NOTABLY SANDALS.

WE CANNOT ASSESS THE FULL IMPACT OF THE AMENDMENT TO THE CN EXPLANATORY

NOTES UNTIL THE NATIONAL CUSTOMS ADMINISTRATIONS CLARIFY THEIR NATIONAL

APPLICATION OF ITS NON-BINDING PROVISIONS. IN THE MEANTIME, WE ARE ASSESSING THE

LEGAL ISSUES RELATING TO BOTH THE COMMISSION'S ACTION IN ISSUING THE AMENDMENT

AND ITS RELATED ADMINISTRATIVE ACTION CONCERNING OTHER FOOTWEAR ORIGINATING IN

CHINA. WE WILL CLOSELY MONITOR FURTHER DEVELOPMENTS AND WILL SEEK, BY INDIVIDUAL

ACTION AND THROUGH RELEVANT TRADE ASSOCIATIONS, TO PREVENT INTERPRETATIONS AND

ADMINISTRATIVE MEASURES THAT WOULD SUBJECT A GREATER PORTION OF OUR PRODUCTS TO

THE QUOTAS AND ANTI-DUMPING DUTIES.

IF THE EU TRADE MEASURES BECOME SUBSTANTIALLY MORE RESTRICTIVE AS A RESULT

OF THE RECENT COMMISSION MEASURES, WE WOULD RECOMMEND THAT OUR EUROPEAN

SUBSIDIARIES CONSIDER, IN ADDITION TO POSSIBLE LEGAL REMEDIES, SHIFTING THE

PRODUCTION OF SUCH FOOTWEAR TO OTHER COUNTRIES IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN COMPETITIVE

PRICING. WE BELIEVE THAT WE ARE PREPARED TO DEAL EFFECTIVELY WITH ANY SUCH

CHANGE OF CIRCUMSTANCES AND THAT ANY ADVERSE IMPACT WOULD BE OF A TEMPORARY

NATURE. WE CONTINUE TO CLOSELY MONITOR INTERNATIONAL RESTRICTIONS AND MAINTAIN

OUR MULTI-COUNTRY SOURCING STRATEGY AND CONTINGENCY PLANS. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR

MAJOR COMPETITORS STAND IN MUCH THE SAME POSITION REGARDING THESE TRADE

MEASURES.

THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA ("CHINA") IS A MATERIAL SOURCE OF FOOTWEAR

PRODUCTION FOR NIKE. AS PART OF CHINA'S BID TO JOIN THE WORLD TRADE ORGANIZATION

("WTO"), AND AFTER THE UNITED STATES AND CHINA REACHED A COMPREHENSIVE TRADE

AGREEMENT, FORMER PRESIDENT CLINTON SUBMITTED LEGISLATION TO CONGRESS WHICH

WOULD GRANT PERMANENT NON-DISCRIMINATORY "NORMAL TRADE RELATIONS" ("NTR",

FORMERLY "MOST FAVORED NATION") TRADING STATUS TO CHINA. IN 2000, CONGRESS

APPROVED THE LEGISLATION, BUT BECAUSE CHINA HAD NOT FINISHED ITS ACCESSION

NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE WTO, IN JUNE 2001 PRESIDENT BUSH EXTENDED NTR TO CHINA ON

AN ANNUAL BASIS. THAT DECISION WAS RECENTLY SUPPORTED BY CONGRESS. ONCE CHINA

COMPLETES THE TERMS OF ACCESSION TO THE WTO, CONGRESS HAS PROVIDED THE PRESIDENT

WITH THE AUTHORITY TO GRANT CHINA PERMANENT NTR. BRINGING CHINA INTO THE WTO AND

PROVIDING PERMANENT NTR TO CHINA WILL EVENTUALLY REDUCE BARRIERS TO PRODUCING

PRODUCTS IN, EXPORTING PRODUCTS FROM, AND MARKETING AND SELLING PRODUCTS WITHIN

CHINA.

WE ARE ALSO CURRENTLY SOURCING FOOTWEAR AND APPAREL PRODUCTS FROM FACTORIES

IN VIETNAM. FROM 1995 TO 1998, FORMER PRESIDENT CLINTON TOOK SEVERAL STEPS TO

NORMALIZE ECONOMIC AND DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES AND

VIETNAM. THE PRESIDENT'S ACTIONS WERE STEPS TOWARD RESTORATION OF FULL TRADE

RELATIONS WHICH INCLUDES THE UNITED STATES GRANTING NON-DISCRIMINATORY NTR

TRADING STATUS TO VIETNAM WHICH WOULD RESULT IN LOWER TARIFFS BETWEEN THE TWO

COUNTRIES. IN JULY 2000, THE UNITED STATES AND VIETNAM SIGNED A COMPREHENSIVE

BILATERAL TRADE AGREEMENT, WHICH WOULD, AMONG OTHER THINGS, PROVIDE RECIPROCAL

NTR BETWEEN THE TWO COUNTRIES. IN JUNE 2001, THAT AGREEMENT WAS SUBMITTED TO

CONGRESS FOR CONSIDERATION. IF APPROVED BY THE U.S. CONGRESS AND THE VIETNAMESE

NATIONAL ASSEMBLY, THE UNITED STATES WILL GRANT AN ANNUAL EXTENSION OF NTR TO

VIETNAM. THIS GRANT MUST BE RENEWED ANNUALLY BY THE PRESIDENT AND REVIEWED BY

THE CONGRESS. WE CURRENTLY BELIEVE THAT CONGRESS WILL CONSIDER THE TRADE

AGREEMENT BY THE END OF THIS CALENDAR YEAR. IF CONGRESS APPROVES THE TRADE

AGREEMENT, THE GRANT OF NTR TRADING STATUS FOR VIETNAM COULD EXPAND OUR

PRODUCTION AND MARKETING OPPORTUNITIES IN VIETNAM AND ALLOW FOR VIETNAMESE

SOURCED PRODUCT TO ENTER THE UNITED STATES AT NTR TARIFF RATES.

COMPETITION

THE ATHLETIC FOOTWEAR, APPAREL AND EQUIPMENT INDUSTRY IS KEENLY COMPETITIVE

IN THE UNITED STATES AND ON A WORLDWIDE BASIS. WE COMPETE INTERNATIONALLY WITH

AN INCREASING NUMBER OF ATHLETIC AND LEISURE SHOE COMPANIES, ATHLETIC AND

LEISURE APPAREL COMPANIES, SPORTS EQUIPMENT COMPANIES, AND LARGE COMPANIES

HAVING DIVERSIFIED LINES OF ATHLETIC AND LEISURE SHOES, APPAREL AND EQUIPMENT,

INCLUDING REEBOK, ADIDAS AND OTHERS. THE INTENSE COMPETITION AND THE RAPID

CHANGES IN TECHNOLOGY AND CONSUMER PREFERENCES IN THE MARKETS FOR ATHLETIC AND

LEISURE FOOTWEAR AND APPAREL, AND ATHLETIC EQUIPMENT, CONSTITUTE SIGNIFICANT

RISK FACTORS IN OUR OPERATIONS.

NIKE IS THE LARGEST SELLER OF ATHLETIC FOOTWEAR AND ATHLETIC APPAREL IN THE

WORLD. PERFORMANCE AND RELIABILITY OF SHOES, APPAREL, AND EQUIPMENT, NEW PRODUCT

DEVELOPMENT, PRICE, PRODUCT IDENTITY THROUGH

6

9

MARKETING AND PROMOTION, AND CUSTOMER SUPPORT AND SERVICE ARE IMPORTANT ASPECTS

OF COMPETITION IN THE ATHLETIC FOOTWEAR, APPAREL AND EQUIPMENT INDUSTRY. TO HELP

MARKET OUR PRODUCTS, WE CONTRACT WITH PROMINENT AND INFLUENTIAL ATHLETES,

COACHES, TEAMS, COLLEGES, AND SPORTS LEAGUES TO ENDORSE OUR BRANDS AND USE OUR

PRODUCTS, AND WE ACTIVELY SPONSOR SPORTING EVENTS AND CLINICS. WE BELIEVE THAT

WE ARE COMPETITIVE IN ALL OF THESE AREAS.

TRADEMARKS AND PATENTS

WE UTILIZE TRADEMARKS ON NEARLY ALL OF OUR PRODUCTS AND BELIEVE THAT HAVING

DISTINCTIVE MARKS THAT ARE READILY IDENTIFIABLE IS AN IMPORTANT FACTOR IN

CREATING A MARKET FOR OUR GOODS, IN IDENTIFYING THE COMPANY, AND IN

DISTINGUISHING OUR GOODS FROM THE GOODS OF OTHERS. WE CONSIDER OUR NIKE(R) AND

SWOOSH DESIGN(R) TRADEMARKS TO BE AMONG OUR MOST VALUABLE ASSETS AND WE HAVE

REGISTERED THESE TRADEMARKS IN OVER 100 COUNTRIES. IN ADDITION, WE OWN MANY

OTHER TRADEMARKS WHICH WE UTILIZE IN MARKETING OUR PRODUCTS. WE CONTINUE TO

VIGOROUSLY PROTECT OUR TRADEMARKS AGAINST INFRINGEMENT.

NIKE HAS AN EXCLUSIVE, WORLDWIDE LICENSE TO MAKE AND SELL FOOTWEAR USING

PATENTED "AIR" TECHNOLOGY. THE PROCESS UTILIZES PRESSURIZED GAS ENCAPSULATED IN

POLYURETHANE. SOME OF THE EARLY NIKE AIR(R) PATENTS HAVE EXPIRED, WHICH MAY

ENABLE COMPETITORS TO USE CERTAIN TYPES OF LIKE TECHNOLOGY. SUBSEQUENT NIKE AIR

PATENTS WILL NOT EXPIRE FOR SEVERAL YEARS. WE ALSO HAVE A NUMBER OF PATENTS

COVERING COMPONENTS AND FEATURES USED IN VARIOUS ATHLETIC AND LEISURE SHOES. WE

BELIEVE THAT OUR SUCCESS DEPENDS PRIMARILY UPON SKILLS IN DESIGN, RESEARCH AND

DEVELOPMENT, PRODUCTION AND MARKETING RATHER THAN UPON OUR PATENT POSITION.

HOWEVER, WE HAVE FOLLOWED A POLICY OF FILING APPLICATIONS FOR UNITED STATES AND

FOREIGN PATENTS ON INVENTIONS, DESIGNS AND IMPROVEMENTS THAT WE DEEM VALUABLE.

ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

EXCEPT AS DESCRIBED BELOW, THERE ARE NO MATERIAL PENDING LEGAL PROCEEDINGS,

OTHER THAN ORDINARY ROUTINE LITIGATION INCIDENTAL TO OUR BUSINESS, TO WHICH WE

ARE A PARTY OR OF WHICH ANY OF OUR PROPERTY IS THE SUBJECT.

THE COMPANY AND CERTAIN OF ITS OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS WERE NAMED AS

DEFENDANTS IN FOUR SUBSTANTIALLY IDENTICAL SECURITIES CLASS ACTIONS FILED IN THE

U.S. DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF OREGON ON MARCH 9, 14, 20, AND APRIL 4,

2001. ON JULY 23, 2001, THE CASES WERE CONSOLIDATED AS IN RE NIKE, INC.

SECURITIES LITIGATION, CV-01-332-K. THE CONSOLIDATED AMENDED COMPLAINT SEEKS

UNSPECIFIED DAMAGES ON BEHALF OF A PURPORTED CLASS CONSISTING OF PURCHASERS OF

THE COMPANY'S STOCK DURING THE PERIOD DECEMBER 20, 2000 THROUGH FEBRUARY 26,

2001. PLAINTIFFS ALLEGE THAT THE DEFENDANTS MADE FALSE AND MISLEADING STATEMENTS

ABOUT THE COMPANY'S ACTUAL AND EXPECTED BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE IN

VIOLATION OF FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS. PLAINTIFFS FURTHER ALLEGE THAT CERTAIN

INDIVIDUAL DEFENDANTS SOLD COMPANY STOCK WHILE IN POSSESSION OF MATERIAL

NON-PUBLIC INFORMATION. WHILE THE LITIGATION IS IN A VERY PRELIMINARY STAGE,

BASED ON THE AVAILABLE INFORMATION WE DO NOT CURRENTLY ANTICIPATE THAT THE

ACTION WILL HAVE A MATERIAL FINANCIAL IMPACT. WE BELIEVE THE CLAIMS ARE WITHOUT

MERIT, AND WE INTEND TO VIGOROUSLY DEFEND THEM.

A RELATED SHAREHOLDER DERIVATIVE LAWSUIT, METIVIER V. DENUNZIO, ET AL.,

0104-04339, WAS FILED IN THE MULTNOMAH COUNTY CIRCUIT COURT OF THE STATE OF

OREGON ON APRIL 26, 2001. THE DERIVATIVE SUIT WAS BROUGHT BY CERTAIN COMPANY

SHAREHOLDERS, ALLEGEDLY ON BEHALF OF THE COMPANY, AGAINST CERTAIN DIRECTORS AND

OFFICERS OF THE COMPANY. THE DERIVATIVE PLAINTIFFS ALLEGE THAT THESE OFFICERS

AND DIRECTORS BREACHED THEIR FIDUCIARY DUTIES TO THE COMPANY BY MAKING OR

CAUSING TO BE MADE ALLEGED MISSTATEMENTS ABOUT THE COMPANY'S ACTUAL AND EXPECTED

FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE WHILE CERTAIN OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS SOLD COMPANY STOCK

AND BY ALLOWING THE COMPANY TO BE SUED IN THE SHAREHOLDER CLASS ACTION. THE

DERIVATIVE PLAINTIFFS SEEK COMPENSATORY AND OTHER

9

12

DAMAGES, AND DISGORGEMENT OF COMPENSATION RECEIVED. ON JULY 25, 2001, THE COURT

ENTERED A STIPULATION AND ORDER ABATING THE ACTION UNTIL FURTHER NOTICE.

IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE COMPANY'S ARTICLES OF INCORPORATION AND BYLAWS, AND

IN ACCORDANCE WITH INDEMNITY AGREEMENTS BETWEEN THE COMPANY AND THE DIRECTORS

AND OFFICERS NAMED IN THE LEGAL ACTIONS, THE COMPANY HAS AGREED TO INDEMNIFY

THESE INDIVIDUALS AND ASSUME THEIR DEFENSE IN THE ACTIONS.

OF OPERATIONS

HIGHLIGHTS

- FISCAL YEAR 2001 REVENUES INCREASED 5.5% TO $9.5 BILLION, COMPARED TO

$9.0 BILLION IN FISCAL YEAR 2000.

- NET INCOME INCREASED IN FISCAL YEAR 2001 TO $589.7 MILLION FROM $579.1

MILLION IN THE PRIOR YEAR.

- FISCAL YEAR 2001 DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE INCREASED BY 4.3%, FROM $2.07

TO $2.16.

- GROSS MARGINS DECLINED AS A PERCENTAGE OF REVENUES TO 39.0% FROM 39.9% IN

FISCAL YEAR 2000.

- SELLING AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES ALSO DECLINED AS A PERCENTAGE OF

REVENUES TO 28.3% FROM 29.0% IN FISCAL YEAR 2000.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

FISCAL 2001 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2000

NET INCOME INCREASED 1.8% OVER FISCAL 2000, FROM $579.1 MILLION TO $589.7

MILLION. ALTHOUGH CONSOLIDATED REVENUES INCREASED 5.5% OVER FISCAL 2000, INCOME

BEFORE INCOME TAXES WAS ESSENTIALLY FLAT AS PRETAX PROFIT MARGINS DECREASED DUE

TO A LOWER GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE, HIGHER INTEREST EXPENSE, AND INCREASED OTHER

OPERATING EXPENSES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER SELLING AND ADMINISTRATIVE

EXPENSES AS A PERCENT OF REVENUE. DESPITE FLAT INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES, NET

INCOME INCREASED DUE TO A LOWER EFFECTIVE TAX RATE. DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE

INCREASED 4.3%, FROM $2.07 TO $2.16. THE PERCENTAGE INCREASE IN EARNINGS PER

SHARE WAS HIGHER THAN THAT OF NET INCOME PRIMARILY DUE TO SHARE REPURCHASES IN

FISCAL YEARS 2000 AND 2001.

NIKE BRAND REVENUES IN THE UNITED STATES REGION INCREASED 1.8% AS COMPARED

TO FISCAL 2000, WHILE NIKE BRAND REVENUES IN OUR INTERNATIONAL REGIONS INCREASED

9.8%. HAD THE U.S. DOLLAR REMAINED CONSTANT WITH THE PRIOR YEAR, THESE

INTERNATIONAL REVENUES WOULD HAVE INCREASED 18.6%, AND CONSOLIDATED REVENUES

WOULD HAVE ADVANCED 9.3%. IN THE UNITED STATES REGION, OUR LARGEST MARKET

SEGMENT, THE 1.8% INCREASE IN REVENUES REFLECTED A 9.2% INCREASE IN APPAREL

SALES AND A 54.4% INCREASE IN EQUIPMENT SALES, OFFSET BY A 4.2% DECREASE IN

FOOTWEAR SALES. THE INCREASES IN APPAREL AND EQUIPMENT REFLECTED STRONGER DEMAND

FOR IN-LINE PRODUCTS. THE INCREASE IN THE EQUIPMENT PRODUCT LINE REFLECTED

INCREASES IN A VARIETY OF SPORTS EQUIPMENT CATEGORIES, INCLUDING GOLF, FOOTBALL,

AND BASEBALL PRODUCTS AS WELL AS SOCKS, BAGS AND EYEWEAR. THE DECREASE IN

FOOTWEAR REFLECTED LOWER DEMAND, PARTICULARLY IN THE MID-RANGE PRICE SEGMENT,

AND SUPPLY CHAIN DISRUPTIONS RESULTING FROM THE IMPLEMENTATION OF A NEW GLOBAL

DEMAND AND SUPPLY PLANNING SYSTEM. THE SUPPLY CHAIN DISRUPTIONS RESULTED IN

PRODUCT EXCESSES AS WELL AS PRODUCT SHORTAGES AND LATE DELIVERIES IN THE SECOND

HALF OF THE FISCAL YEAR.

IN FISCAL 2001, NIKE BRAND REVENUES FROM OUR INTERNATIONAL REGIONS

CONTINUED TO GROW, BOTH AS A PERCENTAGE OF TOTAL COMPANY REVENUES AND IN TOTAL

DOLLARS AS COMPARED TO FISCAL 2000. THESE REVENUES REPRESENTED 44.6% OF TOTAL

COMPANY REVENUES AS COMPARED TO 42.9% IN FISCAL 2000. REVENUES FROM OUR

INTERNATIONAL REGIONS WERE $4.2 BILLION AS COMPARED TO $3.9 BILLION IN FISCAL

2000. REVENUES IN OUR EUROPE, MIDDLE EAST, AND AFRICA (EMEA) REGION INCREASED

FOR THE SEVENTH CONSECUTIVE YEAR. FISCAL 2001 REVENUES IN EMEA INCREASED OVER

FISCAL 2000 BY 7.4% TO $2,584.8 MILLION, A 19.3% INCREASE IN CONSTANT DOLLARS.

IN OUR ASIA PACIFIC REGION, REVENUES GREW 16.2%, A 20.8% INCREASE IN CONSTANT

DOLLARS. THE AMERICAS REGION GREW REVENUES 9.1%, AN 11.4% INCREASE IN CONSTANT

DOLLARS.

IN FISCAL 2001, REVENUE FROM OTHER BRANDS INCREASED 7.2% TO $435.9 MILLION.

WORLDWIDE FUTURES AND ADVANCE ORDERS FOR NIKE BRAND ATHLETIC FOOTWEAR AND

APPAREL SCHEDULED FOR DELIVERY FROM JUNE THROUGH NOVEMBER 2001 WERE 3% HIGHER

THAN SUCH ORDERS BOOKED IN THE COMPARABLE PERIOD OF FISCAL 2000. THE PERCENTAGE

GROWTH IN THESE ORDERS IS NOT NECESSARILY INDICATIVE OF OUR EXPECTATION OF

REVENUE GROWTH IN SUBSEQUENT PERIODS. THIS IS BECAUSE THE MIX OF ORDERS CAN

SHIFT BETWEEN ADVANCE/FUTURES AND AT-ONCE ORDERS. IN ADDITION, EXCHANGE RATE

FLUCTUATIONS AS WELL AS DIFFERING LEVELS OF ORDER CANCELLATIONS CAN CAUSE

DIFFERENCES IN THE COMPARISONS BETWEEN FUTURE ORDERS AND ACTUAL REVENUES.

FINALLY, A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR REVENUES ARE NOT DERIVED FROM FUTURES

ORDERS, INCLUDING THOSE FROM OUR EQUIPMENT PRODUCT LINE, U.S. LICENSED TEAM

APPAREL PRODUCT LINE, RETAIL OPERATIONS, AND OTHER BRANDS, INCLUDING BAUER NIKE

HOCKEY AND COLE HAAN.

OUR GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE DECLINED 90 BASIS POINTS, FROM 39.9% IN FISCAL

2000 TO 39.0% IN FISCAL 2001. FACTORS CONTRIBUTING TO THE LOWER GROSS MARGIN

PERCENTAGE WERE AS FOLLOWS.

(1) THE EFFECT OF THE CHANGE IN FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES, MOST NOTABLY

THE WEAKENING OF THE EURO AGAINST THE U.S. DOLLAR RELATIVE TO FISCAL 2000.

(2) A HIGHER MIX OF CLOSE-OUT SALES AS WELL AS LOWER MARGINS ACHIEVED

ON CLOSE-OUTS, PRIMARILY IN FOOTWEAR AND LICENSED TEAM APPAREL IN THE

UNITED STATES. IN FOOTWEAR, THE HIGHER MIX OF CLOSE-OUTS AND LOWER

CLOSE-OUT MARGINS WERE DUE IN PART TO THE SUPPLY CHAIN DISRUPTIONS

DISCUSSED ABOVE. HIGHER CLOSE-OUTS AND LOWER MARGINS IN U.S. LICENSED TEAM

APPAREL RESULTED PRIMARILY FROM THE LIQUIDATION OF NATIONAL FOOTBALL LEAGUE

("NFL") TEAM APPAREL, DUE TO THE TERMINATION OF OUR NFL LICENSE AGREEMENT

THIS YEAR.

(3) PRODUCT RECALLS OF CERTAIN FOOTWEAR MODELS IN THE UNITED STATES,

WHICH RESULTED IN PRODUCT RETURNS AND WRITE-OFFS.

WE EXPECT THE WEAKNESS OF THE EURO TO PLACE ADDITIONAL NEGATIVE PRESSURE ON

OUR GROSS MARGINS THROUGHOUT FISCAL 2002. IN ADDITION, WE WILL CONTINUE TO

LIQUIDATE EXCESS INVENTORIES CAUSED BY THE SUPPLY CHAIN PROBLEMS, AFFECTING

GROSS MARGINS THROUGH THE FIRST HALF OF FISCAL 2002.

SELLING AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES DECREASED AS A PERCENTAGE OF REVENUES

FROM 29.0% TO 28.3%. THIS DECREASE REFLECTED COST CONTAINMENT MEASURES, BOTH IN

MARKETING AND OPERATIONAL AREAS. WHILE IMPLEMENTING THESE MEASURES TO CONTROL

SELLING AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE GROWTH, WE ALSO CONTINUED TO INVEST IN

OPERATIONAL INITIATIVES DESIGNED TO CREATE FUTURE REVENUES AND PROFITS. THESE

INITIATIVES INCLUDED THE EXPANSION OF NIKE-OWNED RETAIL OUTLETS, THE DEVELOPMENT

OF E-COMMERCE APPLICATIONS, AND SYSTEMS AND PROCESSES SUPPORTING OUR WORLDWIDE

SUPPLY CHAIN. OUR LEVEL OF INVESTMENT IN THESE AREAS WAS COMPARABLE TO OUR LEVEL

OF INVESTMENT IN FISCAL 2000. THE WORLDWIDE SUPPLY CHAIN INITIATIVE IS INTENDED

TO IMPROVE REVENUE (BY INCREASING OUR ABILITY TO RESPOND TO MARKET CONDITIONS),

MARGINS (BY LOWERING CLOSE-OUTS AND DISTRIBUTION COSTS) AND CASH FLOW (BY

14

17

REDUCING INVENTORIES). THE ULTIMATE LEVEL OF BENEFIT TO REVENUES, MARGINS, AND

CASH FLOWS, IF ANY, WILL NOT BE KNOWN UNTIL THE NEW SYSTEMS AND PROCESSES HAVE

BEEN IMPLEMENTED WORLDWIDE OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS.

INTEREST EXPENSE INCREASED 30.4%, FROM $45.0 MILLION TO $58.7 MILLION, DUE

TO HIGHER AVERAGE DEBT LEVELS IN FISCAL 2001 VERSUS FISCAL 2000. DURING FISCAL

2000, WE INCREASED DEBT TO FUND CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND HIGHER WORKING CAPITAL

REQUIREMENTS AND TO REPURCHASE COMMON STOCK. ALTHOUGH OUR DEBT BALANCE DECREASED

DURING FISCAL 2001, THE AVERAGE DEBT BALANCE FOR FISCAL 2001 REMAINED ABOVE THE

PRIOR YEAR.

OTHER INCOME/EXPENSE WAS A NET EXPENSE OF $34.2 MILLION VERSUS A NET

EXPENSE OF $23.2 MILLION IN FISCAL 2000. SIGNIFICANT AMOUNTS INCLUDED IN OTHER

INCOME/EXPENSE WERE INTEREST INCOME, PROFIT SHARING EXPENSE, GOODWILL

AMORTIZATION, CERTAIN FOREIGN CURRENCY CONVERSION GAINS AND LOSSES, AND ASSET

DISPOSAL GAINS AND LOSSES.

OUR FISCAL 2001 EFFECTIVE TAX RATE WAS 36.0% AS COMPARED TO 37.0% IN FISCAL

2000. FACTORS CONTRIBUTING TO THIS DECREASE INCLUDED LOWER TAXES ON A PORTION OF

FOREIGN EARNINGS THAT HAVE BEEN PERMANENTLY INVESTED OUTSIDE OF THE U.S. AND

ADDITIONAL RESEARCH TAX CREDITS.

FISCAL 2000 COMPARED TO FISCAL 1999

NET INCOME INCREASED 28.3% IN FISCAL 2000 OVER FISCAL 1999, FROM $451.4

MILLION TO $579.1 MILLION. EXCLUDING THE IMPACT OF RESTRUCTURING CHARGE ACTIVITY

IN FISCAL 1999, NET INCOME ADVANCED $100.4 MILLION, OR 21.0%. INCOME BEFORE

INCOME TAXES INCREASED DUE TO INCREASED REVENUES AND AN IMPROVED GROSS MARGIN,

PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER SELLING AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES. THE INCREASED

SELLING AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES IN LARGE PART REFLECTED SIGNIFICANT

INVESTMENTS IN NEW SUPPLY CHAIN SYSTEMS, E-COMMERCE INITIATIVES, AND NEW RETAIL

STORES, DISCUSSED FURTHER BELOW. THE INCREASE IN NET INCOME PRIMARILY REFLECTED

THE IMPROVED INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES, BUT ALSO REFLECTED A LOWER EFFECTIVE

TAX RATE. DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE INCREASED 31.8%, MORE RAPIDLY THAN NET

INCOME, AS A RESULT OF SHARE REPURCHASES DURING FISCAL 2000. EXCLUDING THE

IMPACT OF RESTRUCTURING CHARGES, DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE INCREASED 24.7%.

TOTAL NIKE REVENUES INCREASED BY 2.5% IN FISCAL 2000. NIKE BRAND REVENUES

IN THE UNITED STATES REGION WERE FLAT AS COMPARED TO FISCAL 1999 WHILE NIKE

BRAND REVENUES IN OUR INTERNATIONAL REGIONS INCREASED 6.9%. HAD THE U.S. DOLLAR

REMAINED CONSTANT WITH THE PRIOR YEAR, THESE INTERNATIONAL REVENUES WOULD HAVE

INCREASED 11.9%, AND CONSOLIDATED REVENUES WOULD HAVE ADVANCED 4.5%. REVENUE

GROWTH IN THE UNITED STATES WAS SLOWED BY A CONTRACTION OF ATHLETIC SPORTSWEAR

RETAIL SPACE.

IN FISCAL 2000, NIKE BRAND REVENUES FROM OUR INTERNATIONAL REGIONS

REPRESENTED 42.9% OF TOTAL COMPANY REVENUES AND GREW SIGNIFICANTLY DURING THE

YEAR. FISCAL 2000 REVENUES IN EMEA INCREASED OVER FISCAL 1999 BY 4.9% TO

$2,407.0 MILLION, 15.5% IN CONSTANT DOLLARS. IN OUR ASIA PACIFIC REGION,

REVENUES GREW 13.1%, A 4.7% INCREASE IN CONSTANT DOLLARS. THE AMERICAS REGION

GREW REVENUES 5.3%, 7.2% IN CONSTANT DOLLARS.

IN FISCAL 2000, OUR GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE IMPROVED 250 BASIS POINTS, FROM

37.4% TO 39.9%. THE KEY FACTORS IN THE IMPROVEMENT OF MARGINS WERE AS FOLLOWS.

(1) INCREASED MARGINS ON IN-LINE PRODUCTS, PARTICULARLY IN APPAREL AND

EQUIPMENT.

(2) REDUCED LEVELS OF LOWER MARGIN CLOSE-OUT SALES, REFLECTING LOWER

INVENTORIES OF CLOSE-OUT, OUT-OF-SEASON PRODUCT.

(3) HIGHER MARGINS ON CLOSE-OUT SALES, DRIVEN BY THE EXPANSION OF OUR

NETWORK OF OUTLET STORES.

SELLING AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES INCREASED 7.4% IN FISCAL 2000 TO

$2,606.4 MILLION. MUCH OF THE INCREASE WAS DRIVEN BY INVESTMENTS DESIGNED TO

CREATE FUTURE REVENUES AND PROFITS, INCLUDING OPENING NEW NIKE-OWNED RETAIL

OUTLETS, DEVELOPMENT OF E-COMMERCE CAPABILITY, INITIATIVES TO STREAMLINE OUR

SUPPLY CHAIN, AND THE CONVERSION OF CERTAIN INTERNATIONAL MARKETS FROM

INDEPENDENT DISTRIBUTORSHIPS TO DIRECT NIKE OWNERSHIP. HIGHER BAD DEBT EXPENSE

DUE TO THE BANKRUPTCY FILING OF ONE OF OUR U.S. CUSTOMERS, ALSO INCREASED

SELLING AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES IN FISCAL 2000 VERSUS FISCAL 1999.

INTEREST EXPENSE INCREASED BY 2.0% DURING FISCAL 2000 TO $45.0 MILLION.

THIS INCREASE REFLECTED INCREMENTAL INTEREST COSTS DUE TO SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER

AVERAGE DEBT BALANCES THAN IN FISCAL 1999. (MUCH OF THIS INCREASE WAS OFFSET BY

THE EFFECT OF LOWER INTEREST RATES OUTSIDE OF THE U.S. AND THE EFFECT OF OUR

RESTRUCTURED OPERATING AGREEMENT WITH NIAC, WHICH REDUCED THE INTEREST RATE ON

PRODUCT PURCHASES FINANCED BY NIAC.)

15

18

OTHER INCOME/EXPENSE WAS A NET EXPENSE OF $23.2 MILLION IN FISCAL 2000 AS

COMPARED TO A NET EXPENSE OF $21.5 MILLION IN FISCAL 1999. SIGNIFICANT AMOUNTS

INCLUDED IN OTHER INCOME/EXPENSE WERE INTEREST INCOME, PROFIT SHARING EXPENSE,

GOODWILL AMORTIZATION, CERTAIN FOREIGN EXCHANGE CONVERSION GAINS AND LOSSES, AND

ASSET DISPOSAL GAINS AND LOSSES. IN FISCAL 1999, OTHER INCOME/EXPENSE ALSO

INCLUDED A $15.0 MILLION CREDIT RELATED TO THE CHANGE IN ACCOUNTING FOR

SUBSTANTIALLY ALL INVENTORIES IN THE U.S. FROM THE LAST-IN, FIRST-OUT (LIFO)

METHOD TO THE FIRST-IN, FIRST-OUT (FIFO) METHOD. THE CHANGE WAS NOT SUFFICIENTLY

MATERIAL TO REQUIRE PRESENTATION OF THE CUMULATIVE EFFECT OR TO RESTATE

COMPARABLE INCOME STATEMENTS AS DICTATED BY ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES BOARD OPINION

NO. 20.

OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE WAS 37.0% IN FISCAL 2000, SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER THAN

THE PRIOR YEAR RATE OF 39.5% IN FISCAL 1999. THIS DECREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO

REDUCED STATE TAXES AND THE UTILIZATION OF TAX LOSS CARRYFORWARDS IN CERTAIN

RECENTLY PROFITABLE FOREIGN OPERATIONS, WHERE OUR EFFECTIVE RATE IS LOWER THAN

IN THE U.S.

FISCAL 1999 RESTRUCTURING CHARGE

DURING FISCAL 1999, THE COMPANY INCURRED A $60.1 MILLION RESTRUCTURING

CHARGE AS A RESULT OF CERTAIN ACTIONS TAKEN TO BETTER ALIGN OUR COST STRUCTURE

WITH EXPECTED REVENUE GROWTH RATES. AS A RESULT OF THE RESTRUCTURING ACTIONS, WE

WERE ABLE TO REMOVE APPROXIMATELY $36 MILLION FROM OUR COST STRUCTURE.

THE CHARGE (SHOWN BELOW IN TABULAR FORMAT) WAS PRIMARILY FOR COSTS OF

SEVERING EMPLOYEES, INCLUDING SEVERANCE PACKAGES, LEASE ABANDONMENTS AND THE

WRITE DOWN OF ASSETS NO LONGER IN USE. TWO MAJOR AREAS THAT WERE AFFECTED BY THE

REDUCTION IN FORCE INCLUDE OUR INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY FUNCTIONS, PRIMARILY IN

THE U.S., AS WE SHIFTED TO AN OUTSOURCE AGREEMENT FOR CERTAIN AREAS OF OUR

OPERATIONS, AND EUROPEAN CUSTOMER SERVICE AND ACCOUNTING, WHERE WE HAVE BEEN

CONSOLIDATING FUNCTIONS FROM INDIVIDUAL COUNTRIES TO OUR EUROPEAN HEADQUARTERS.

OUTSIDE OF THESE TWO AREAS, EMPLOYEES WERE TERMINATED FROM VARIOUS OTHER AREAS

AROUND THE COMPANY, INCLUDING OUR ASIA PACIFIC REGION. THE ORIGINAL NUMBER OF

EMPLOYEES TO BE TERMINATED WAS 1,291. AS OF MAY 31, 2001, 71 EMPLOYEES HAVE

FOUND POSITIONS ELSEWHERE IN THE COMPANY AND 1,200 HAVE LEFT THE COMPANY,

LEAVING 20 STILL TO BE TERMINATED.

THE SECOND MAJOR COMPONENT OF THE 1999 CHARGE WAS A WRITE-OFF OF CERTAIN

EQUIPMENT, HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT COSTS AT ONE OF OUR U.S.

DISTRIBUTION CENTERS DUE TO A CHANGE IN STRATEGY AROUND HOW WE FLOW PRODUCT FOR

A SPECIFIC TYPE OF BUSINESS.

DUE TO THE CHANGE IN THE NUMBER OF EMPLOYEES THAT WILL BE TERMINATED, $0.1

MILLION AND $1.4 MILLION OF THE RESERVE WAS REVERSED DURING FISCAL 2001 AND

FISCAL 2000, RESPECTIVELY. THE REMAINING ACCRUAL BALANCE AS OF MAY 31, 2001 OF

$1.5 MILLION WILL BE RELIEVED AS LEASES EXPIRE AND SEVERANCE PAYMENTS ARE

COMPLETED.

EURO CONVERSION

ON JANUARY 1, 1999, ELEVEN OF THE FIFTEEN MEMBER COUNTRIES OF THE EUROPEAN

UNION ESTABLISHED PERMANENT, FIXED CONVERSION RATES BETWEEN THEIR EXISTING

CURRENCIES AND THE EUROPEAN UNION'S NEW COMMON CURRENCY, THE EURO. IN JANUARY

2001, AN ADDITIONAL COUNTRY, GREECE, ALSO ESTABLISHED A FIXED CONVERSION RATE TO

THE EURO. DURING THE TRANSITION PERIOD ENDING DECEMBER 31, 2001, PUBLIC AND

PRIVATE PARTIES MAY PAY FOR GOODS AND SERVICES USING EITHER THE EURO OR THE

PARTICIPATING COUNTRY'S LEGACY CURRENCY. BEGINNING JANUARY 1, 2002, EURO

DENOMINATED BILLS AND COINS WILL BE ISSUED, AND THE LEGACY CURRENCIES WILL BE

COMPLETELY WITHDRAWN FROM CIRCULATION ON JUNE 30, 2002.

WE HAVE HAD A DEDICATED PROJECT TEAM WORKING ON THE EURO TRANSITION

STRATEGY SINCE JANUARY 1998. WE HAVE MADE MODIFICATIONS TO INFORMATION

TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS SUPPORTING MARKETING, ORDER MANAGEMENT, PURCHASING,

INVOICING, PAYROLL, AND CASH MANAGEMENT FUNCTIONS, IN ORDER TO MAKE THEM EURO

COMPLIANT. ALL MAJOR SYSTEMS HAVE BEEN CONVERTED AND ARE EURO COMPLIANT, WELL

AHEAD OF THE END OF THE TRANSITIONAL PERIOD.

WE BELIEVE THE INTRODUCTION OF THE EURO MAY CREATE A MOVE TOWARDS A GREATER

LEVEL OF WHOLESALE PRICE HARMONIZATION, ALTHOUGH DIFFERING COUNTRY COSTS AND

VALUE ADDED TAX RATES WILL CONTINUE TO RESULT IN PRICE DIFFERENCES AT THE RETAIL

LEVEL. OVER THE PAST THREE YEARS, WE HAVE BEEN ACTIVELY WORKING TO ASSESS AND,

WHERE NECESSARY, ADJUST PRICING PRACTICES TO OPERATE EFFECTIVELY IN THIS NEW

ENVIRONMENT.

THE COSTS OF ADAPTING OUR SYSTEMS AND PRACTICES TO THE IMPLEMENTATION OF

THE EURO WERE GENERALLY RELATED TO THE MODIFICATION OF EXISTING SYSTEMS AND

TOTALED APPROXIMATELY $8 MILLION. THESE COSTS WERE EXPENSED AS INCURRED,

PRIMARILY IN FISCAL 2000. WE BELIEVE THAT THE CONVERSION TO THE EURO WILL NOT

HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

EFFECTIVE JUNE 1, 2001, WE WILL ADOPT STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING

STANDARDS ("SFAS") NO. 133, "ACCOUNTING FOR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING

ACTIVITIES," AS AMENDED BY SFAS NO. 138, "ACCOUNTING FOR CERTAIN DERIVATIVE

INSTRUMENTS AND CERTAIN HEDGING ACTIVITIES" (FAS 133).

AS REQUIRED UPON ADOPTION OF FAS 133, A ONE-TIME TRANSITION ADJUSTMENT WILL

BE RECORDED AS OF JUNE 1, 2001 ON BOTH OUR CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF INCOME AND

CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET. WE ESTIMATE THAT THE TRANSITION ADJUSTMENT ON THE

CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF INCOME TO BE A CHARGE OF APPROXIMATELY $5.1 MILLION,

NET OF TAX EFFECT. THIS AMOUNT RELATES TO AN INVESTMENT THAT WILL BE ADJUSTED TO

FAIR VALUE IN ACCORDANCE WITH FAS 133. THE TRANSITION ADJUSTMENT ON THE

CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET REPRESENTS THE INITIAL RECOGNITION OF THE FAIR VALUES

OF HEDGE DERIVATIVES OUTSTANDING ON THE ADOPTION DATE AND REALIZED GAINS AND

LOSSES ON EFFECTIVE HEDGES FOR WHICH THE UNDERLYING EXPOSURE HAS NOT YET

AFFECTED EARNINGS. THE TRANSITION ADJUSTMENT ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET

IS ESTIMATED TO BE AN INCREASE IN CURRENT ASSETS OF $118.5 MILLION, AN INCREASE

IN NONCURRENT ASSETS OF $87.0 MILLION, AN INCREASE IN CURRENT LIABILITIES OF

$151.6 MILLION, AND AN INCREASE IN OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME OF APPROXIMATELY

$59.0 MILLION, NET OF TAX EFFECTS.

IN JULY 2001, THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD ISSUED SFAS NO. 142

(FAS 142), "GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS." OUR ADOPTION DATE IS EXPECTED

TO BE JUNE 1, 2002. AS REQUIRED BY FAS 142, WE WILL PERFORM AN IMPAIRMENT TEST

ON GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS AS OF THE ADOPTION DATE. THEREAFTER, WE

WILL PERFORM IMPAIRMENT TESTS ANNUALLY AND WHENEVER EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES

OCCUR INDICATING THAT GOODWILL OR OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS MIGHT BE IMPAIRED.

AMORTIZATION OF GOODWILL AND CERTAIN OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS, INCLUDING THOSE

RECORDED IN PAST BUSINESS COMBINATIONS, WILL CEASE. WE HAVE NOT YET DETERMINED

WHAT THE IMPACT OF FAS 142 WILL BE ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL

POSITION.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATIONS WAS $656.5 MILLION IN FISCAL 2001, COMPARED TO

$699.6 MILLION IN FISCAL 2000. OUR PRIMARY SOURCE OF OPERATING CASH FLOW WAS NET

INCOME EARNED DURING THE YEAR OF $589.7 MILLION. THE COMPANY ALSO GENERATED CASH

FLOW BY UTILIZING TAX LOSS CARRYFORWARDS, WHICH RESULTED IN A DECREASE IN

DEFERRED INCOME TAX ASSETS DURING THE YEAR, AND FROM INCOME TAX BENEFITS FROM

STOCK OPTION EXERCISES. THESE CASH

17

20

INFLOWS WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A SLIGHT INCREASE IN OPERATING WORKING CAPITAL,

WHICH REFLECTED A HIGHER LEVEL OF OPERATING ACTIVITY IN THE CURRENT FISCAL YEAR.

CASH USED BY INVESTING ACTIVITIES DURING FISCAL 2001 WAS $342.3 MILLION,

COMPARED TO $440.0 MILLION INVESTED DURING FISCAL 2000. THE TOTAL FOR FISCAL

2001 RELATED PRIMARILY TO CAPITAL EXPENDITURES FOR COMPUTER EQUIPMENT AND

SOFTWARE, DRIVEN BY OUR SUPPLY CHAIN INITIATIVE; INVESTMENTS IN NEW RETAIL

OUTLETS; THE EXPANSION OF OUR WORLD HEADQUARTERS; AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW

DISTRIBUTION FACILITIES IN JAPAN. DURING FISCAL 2002, WE WILL CONTINUE TO INCUR

EXPENDITURES RELATED TO THE SUPPLY CHAIN INITIATIVE AND RETAIL EXPANSION,

ALTHOUGH WE CURRENTLY EXPECT TOTAL CAPITAL EXPENDITURES TO BE LESS THAN THE

TOTAL FOR FISCAL 2001.

CASH USED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES IN FISCAL YEAR 2001 WAS $349.9 MILLION,

UP FROM $252.1 MILLION IN THE PRIOR YEAR. THIS AMOUNT INCLUDED USES OF CASH FOR

DIVIDENDS TO SHAREHOLDERS, A NET REDUCTION OF SHORT-TERM DEBT, PAYMENT OF A

MATURING NOTE PAYABLE, AND SHARE REPURCHASES. THESE USES OF CASH WERE PARTIALLY

OFFSET BY PROCEEDS FROM THE EXERCISE OF EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTIONS.

THE SHARE REPURCHASES WERE PART OF A $1.0 BILLION SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM

THAT BEGAN IN FISCAL 2001, AFTER COMPLETION OF A FOUR-YEAR, $1.0 BILLION PROGRAM

IN FISCAL 2000. TO DATE, UNDER THE NEW PROGRAM WE HAVE PURCHASED A TOTAL OF 4.0

MILLION SHARES OF NIKE'S CLASS B COMMON STOCK FOR $157.0 MILLION. WE EXPECT TO

FUND THE CURRENT PROGRAM LARGELY FROM OPERATING CASH FLOW. THE TIMING AND THE

AMOUNT OF SHARES PURCHASED WILL BE DICTATED BY OUR CAPITAL NEEDS AND STOCK

MARKET CONDITIONS.

WE HAVE FILED A SHELF REGISTRATION WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE

COMMISSION (SEC) UNDER WHICH $500.0 MILLION IN DEBT SECURITIES ARE AVAILABLE TO

BE ISSUED. OUR LONG-TERM DEBT RATING IS A2 AND A BY MOODY'S INVESTOR SERVICE AND

STANDARD AND POOR'S CORPORATION, RESPECTIVELY.

LIQUIDITY IS ALSO PROVIDED BY OUR COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAM, UNDER WHICH

THERE WAS $710.0 MILLION AND $691.9 MILLION OUTSTANDING AT MAY 31, 2001 AND MAY

31, 2000, RESPECTIVELY. OUR ISSUANCES OF COMMERCIAL PAPER ARE REQUIRED TO BE

SUPPORTED BY COMMITTED LINES OF CREDIT AND/OR CASH. DURING FISCAL 2001, WE

ENTERED INTO A NEW $1.25 BILLION COMMITTED CREDIT FACILITY WITH A GROUP OF

BANKS: $750 MILLION HAS A MATURITY OF 364 DAYS FROM THE FACILITY DATE AND $500

MILLION HAS A MATURITY OF FIVE YEARS FROM THE FACILITY DATE. TO DATE, WE HAVE

NOT BORROWED UNDER THIS FACILITY. EACH YEAR, THE $750 MILLION, 364 DAY FACILITY

CAN BE EXTENDED 364 DAYS, AND THE $500 MILLION, FIVE YEAR FACILITY CAN BE

EXTENDED ONE YEAR. OUR RATINGS FOR THE ISSUANCE OF COMMERCIAL PAPER ARE P1 AND

A1 BY MOODY'S INVESTOR SERVICE AND STANDARD AND POOR'S CORPORATION,

RESPECTIVELY. WE ALSO MAINTAIN SIGNIFICANT UNCOMMITTED SHORT AND LONG-TERM LINES

OF CREDIT WITH BANKS. AT MAY 31, 2001 AND 2000, WE HAD LETTERS OF CREDIT

OUTSTANDING TOTALING $851.8 MILLION AND $678.2 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. THESE

LETTERS OF CREDIT WERE ISSUED FOR THE PURCHASE OF INVENTORY.

MANAGEMENT CURRENTLY BELIEVES THAT CASH GENERATED BY OPERATIONS, TOGETHER

WITH ACCESS TO EXTERNAL SOURCES OF FUNDS, WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO MEET OUR

OPERATING AND CAPITAL NEEDS.

DIVIDENDS PER SHARE OF COMMON STOCK FOR FISCAL 2001 WERE $0.48, THE SAME AS

IN FISCAL 2000. WE HAVE PAID A DIVIDEND FOR EVERY QUARTER SINCE FEBRUARY 1984.

CONSISTENT WITH OUR PRACTICE IN PRIOR YEARS, WE WILL REVIEW OUR DIVIDEND POLICY

AT THE MEETING OF OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS IN NOVEMBER; HOWEVER, BASED UPON

CURRENT PROJECTED EARNINGS AND CASH FLOW REQUIREMENTS, WE ANTICIPATE CONTINUING

TO PAY A QUARTERLY DIVIDEND.

ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS AND CONSISTENT WITH ESTABLISHED POLICIES

AND PROCEDURES, WE EMPLOY A VARIETY OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS TO MANAGE EXPOSURE

TO FLUCTUATIONS IN THE VALUE OF FOREIGN CURRENCIES AND INTEREST RATES. IT IS OUR

POLICY TO UTILIZE THESE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS ONLY WHERE NECESSARY TO FINANCE

OUR BUSINESS AND MANAGE SUCH EXPOSURES; WE DO NOT ENTER INTO THESE TRANSACTIONS

FOR SPECULATIVE PURPOSES.

WE ARE EXPOSED TO FOREIGN CURRENCY FLUCTUATION AS A RESULT OF OUR

INTERNATIONAL SALES, PRODUCTION AND FUNDING ACTIVITIES. OUR FOREIGN CURRENCY

RISK MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVE IS TO PROTECT CASH FLOWS FROM THE ADVERSE IMPACT OF

EXCHANGE RATE MOVEMENTS. WE USE FORWARD EXCHANGE CONTRACTS AND PURCHASED OPTIONS

TO HEDGE CERTAIN FIRM COMMITMENTS AND THE RELATED RECEIVABLES AND PAYABLES,

INCLUDING THIRD PARTY OR INTERCOMPANY TRANSACTIONS, AND USE PURCHASED CURRENCY

OPTIONS TO HEDGE CERTAIN ANTICIPATED BUT NOT YET FIRMLY COMMITTED

18

21

TRANSACTIONS. WHEN WE BEGIN HEDGING EXPOSURES DEPENDS ON THE NATURE OF THE

EXPOSURE AND MARKET CONDITIONS. GENERALLY, ALL FIRMLY COMMITTED AND ANTICIPATED

TRANSACTIONS THAT ARE HEDGED ARE TO BE RECOGNIZED WITHIN TWELVE MONTHS. IN

ADDITION, WE USE CROSS-CURRENCY SWAPS TO HEDGE FOREIGN CURRENCY DENOMINATED

PAYMENTS UNDER INTERCOMPANY LOAN AGREEMENTS. HEDGED TRANSACTIONS ARE PRINCIPALLY

DENOMINATED IN EUROPEAN CURRENCIES, JAPANESE YEN, AUSTRALIAN DOLLARS, CANADIAN

DOLLARS, AND KOREAN WON.

OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE IS ALSO EXPOSED TO MOVEMENTS IN SHORT AND

LONG-TERM MARKET INTEREST RATES. OUR OBJECTIVE IN MANAGING THIS INTEREST RATE

EXPOSURE IS TO LIMIT THE IMPACT OF INTEREST RATE CHANGES ON EARNINGS AND CASH

FLOWS, AND TO REDUCE OVERALL BORROWING COSTS. TO ACHIEVE THESE OBJECTIVES, WE

MAINTAIN A MIX OF MEDIUM AND LONG-TERM FIXED RATE DEBT, COMMERCIAL PAPER, BANK

LOANS AND TRADE FINANCING FROM NIAC.

MARKET RISK MEASUREMENT

WE MONITOR FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK, INTEREST RATE RISK AND RELATED

DERIVATIVES USING A VARIETY OF TECHNIQUES INCLUDING A REVIEW OF MARKET VALUE,

SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS, AND VALUE-AT-RISK (VAR). OUR MARKET-SENSITIVE DERIVATIVE

AND OTHER FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, AS DEFINED BY THE SEC, ARE FOREIGN CURRENCY

FORWARD CONTRACTS, FOREIGN CURRENCY OPTION CONTRACTS, CROSS-CURRENCY SWAPS,

INTERCOMPANY LOANS DENOMINATED IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES, FIXED INTEREST RATE U.S.

DOLLAR DENOMINATED DEBT AND FIXED INTEREST RATE JAPANESE YEN DENOMINATED DEBT.

WE USE VAR TO MONITOR THE FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK OF OUR FOREIGN CURRENCY

FORWARD AND FOREIGN CURRENCY OPTION DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS ONLY. THE VAR

DETERMINES THE MAXIMUM POTENTIAL ONE-DAY LOSS IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THESE FOREIGN

EXCHANGE RATE-SENSITIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS. THE VAR MODEL ESTIMATES ASSUME

NORMAL MARKET CONDITIONS AND A 95% CONFIDENCE LEVEL. THERE ARE VARIOUS MODELING

TECHNIQUES THAT CAN BE USED IN THE VAR COMPUTATION. OUR COMPUTATIONS ARE BASED

ON INTERRELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN CURRENCIES AND INTEREST RATES (A

"VARIANCE/CO-VARIANCE" TECHNIQUE). WE DETERMINED THESE INTERRELATIONSHIPS BY

OBSERVING FOREIGN EXCHANGE CURRENCY MARKET CHANGES AND INTEREST RATE CHANGES

OVER THE PRECEDING ONE YEAR. THE VALUE OF FOREIGN CURRENCY OPTIONS DOES NOT

CHANGE ON A ONE-TO-ONE BASIS WITH CHANGES IN THE UNDERLYING CURRENCY RATE. WE

ADJUSTED THE POTENTIAL LOSS IN OPTION VALUE FOR THE ESTIMATED SENSITIVITY (THE

"DELTA" AND "GAMMA") TO CHANGES IN THE UNDERLYING CURRENCY RATE. WE HAVE

EXCLUDED ANTICIPATED TRANSACTIONS, FIRM COMMITMENTS, CASH BALANCES AND ACCOUNTS

RECEIVABLE AND PAYABLE DENOMINATED IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES FROM THE VAR

CALCULATION, WHICH CERTAIN OF THESE INSTRUMENTS ARE INTENDED TO HEDGE.

THE VAR MODEL IS A RISK ANALYSIS TOOL AND DOES NOT PURPORT TO REPRESENT

ACTUAL LOSSES IN FAIR VALUE THAT WE WILL INCUR, NOR DOES IT CONSIDER THE

POTENTIAL EFFECT OF FAVORABLE CHANGES IN MARKET RATES. IT ALSO DOES NOT

REPRESENT THE FULL EXTENT OF THE POSSIBLE LOSS THAT MAY OCCUR. ACTUAL FUTURE

GAINS AND LOSSES WILL DIFFER FROM THOSE ESTIMATED BECAUSE OF CHANGES OR

DIFFERENCES IN MARKET RATES AND INTERRELATIONSHIPS, HEDGING INSTRUMENTS AND

HEDGE PERCENTAGES, TIMING AND OTHER FACTORS.

THE ESTIMATED MAXIMUM ONE-DAY LOSS IN FAIR VALUE ON NIKE'S FOREIGN CURRENCY

SENSITIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, DERIVED USING THE VAR MODEL, WAS $18.9 MILLION

AND $9.5 MILLION AT MAY 31, 2001 AND MAY 31, 2000, RESPECTIVELY. SUCH A

HYPOTHETICAL LOSS IN FAIR VALUE OF OUR DERIVATIVES WOULD BE OFFSET BY INCREASES

IN THE VALUE OF THE UNDERLYING TRANSACTIONS BEING HEDGED.

DETAILS OF ALL OTHER MARKET-SENSITIVE DERIVATIVE AND OTHER FINANCIAL

INSTRUMENTS, INCLUDING THEIR FAIR VALUES, ARE INCLUDED IN THE TABLE BELOW. THESE

INSTRUMENTS INCLUDE INTERCOMPANY LOANS DENOMINATED IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES, FIXED

INTEREST RATE JAPANESE YEN DENOMINATED DEBT, FIXED INTEREST RATE U.S. DOLLAR

DENOMINATED DEBT, AND CROSS-CURRENCY SWAPS. FOR DEBT OBLIGATIONS, THE TABLE

PRESENTS PRINCIPAL CASH FLOWS AND RELATED WEIGHTED AVERAGE INTEREST RATES BY

EXPECTED MATURITY DATES. WE HAVE EXCLUDED THE CROSS-CURRENCY SWAPS FROM THE

FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK CATEGORY BECAUSE THESE INSTRUMENTS ELIMINATE ALL FOREIGN

CURRENCY EXPOSURE IN THE CASH FLOWS OF A DUTCH GUILDER DENOMINATED INTER-COMPANY

LOAN. WE HAVE INCLUDED THESE CROSS-CURRENCY SWAPS IN THE INTEREST RATE RISK

CATEGORY BUT EXCLUDED THE RELATED INTERCOMPANY LOAN FROM THIS CATEGORY BECAUSE

THE INTERCOMPANY INTEREST ELIMINATES IN CONSOLIDATION. FOR THE CROSS-CURRENCY

SWAPS THE TABLE PRESENTS BOTH THE DUTCH GUILDER SWAP PAYABLE AND U.S. DOLLAR

SWAP RECEIVABLE AND THE RESPECTIVE PAY AND RECEIVE INTEREST RATES. ALL

INFORMATION IS PRESENTED IN U.S. DOLLAR EQUIVALENTS, IN MILLIONS, EXCEPT

INTEREST RATES.

THE FIXED INTEREST RATE JAPANESE YEN DENOMINATED DEBTS WERE ISSUED BY AND

ARE ACCOUNTED FOR BY TWO OF NIKE'S JAPANESE SUBSIDIARIES. ACCORDINGLY, THE

MONTHLY REMEASUREMENT OF THESE INSTRUMENTS DUE TO CHANGES IN FOREIGN EXCHANGE

RATES IS RECOGNIZED IN ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME UPON THE

CONSOLIDATION OF THESE SUBSIDIARIES.

THERE WAS NOT A SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN DEBT OR CROSS-CURRENCY SWAP MARKET

RISKS DURING FISCAL 2001. THE U.S. DOLLAR FAIR VALUES OF INTERCOMPANY LOANS

DENOMINATED IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES WAS $692.8 MILLION AT MAY 31, 2000, WHICH IS

THE SAME AS THE CARRYING VALUES OF THE LOANS PRIOR TO THEIR ELIMINATION. THE

U.S. DOLLAR FAIR VALUE OF THE FIXED RATE JAPANESE YEN DENOMINATED DEBT THAT WAS

OUTSTANDING AT MAY 31, 2000 WAS $220.4 MILLION VERSUS A CARRYING VALUE OF $219.8

MILLION AT THAT DATE. THE U.S. DOLLAR FAIR VALUES OF THE FIXED RATE U.S. DOLLAR

DENOMINATED DEBT, THE DUTCH GUILDER SWAP PAYABLE AND THE U.S. DOLLAR SWAP

RECEIVABLE AS OF MAY 31, 2000 WERE $288.4 MILLION, $226.6 MILLION AND $288.8

MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, VERSUS CARRYING VALUES OF $299.6 MILLION, $227.6 MILLION

AND $300 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, AT THAT DATE.

NIKE, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 1 -- SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES.

BASIS OF CONSOLIDATION.

THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDE THE ACCOUNTS OF NIKE, INC.

AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES (THE COMPANY). ALL SIGNIFICANT INTERCOMPANY TRANSACTIONS

AND BALANCES HAVE BEEN ELIMINATED.

RECOGNITION OF REVENUES.

WHOLESALE REVENUES ARE RECOGNIZED WHEN TITLE PASSES AND THE RISKS AND

REWARDS OF OWNERSHIP HAVE PASSED TO THE CUSTOMER BASED ON THE TERMS OF SALE.

TITLE PASSES GENERALLY UPON SHIPMENT OR UPON RECEIPT BY THE CUSTOMER DEPENDING

ON THE COUNTRY OF THE SALE AND THE AGREEMENT WITH THE CUSTOMER. RETAIL STORE

REVENUES ARE RECORDED AT THE TIME OF SALE. PROVISIONS FOR SALES DISCOUNTS AND

RETURNS ARE MADE AT THE TIME OF SALE.

ADVERTISING AND PROMOTION.

ADVERTISING PRODUCTION COSTS ARE EXPENSED THE FIRST TIME THE ADVERTISEMENT

IS RUN. MEDIA (TV AND PRINT) PLACEMENT COSTS ARE EXPENSED IN THE MONTH THE

ADVERTISING APPEARS. THE MAJORITY OF THE COMPANY'S PROMOTIONAL EXPENSES RESULT

FROM PAYMENTS UNDER ENDORSEMENT CONTRACTS. ACCOUNTING FOR ENDORSEMENT PAYMENTS

IS BASED UPON SPECIFIC CONTRACT PROVISIONS. GENERALLY, ENDORSEMENT PAYMENTS ARE

EXPENSED UNIFORMLY OVER THE TERM OF THE CONTRACT AFTER GIVING RECOGNITION TO

PERIODIC PERFORMANCE COMPLIANCE PROVISIONS OF THE CONTRACTS. PREPAYMENTS MADE

UNDER CONTRACTS ARE INCLUDED IN PREPAID EXPENSES OR OTHER ASSETS DEPENDING ON

THE LENGTH OF THE CONTRACT. TOTAL ADVERTISING AND PROMOTION EXPENSES WERE

$1,000.5 MILLION, $978.2 MILLION AND $978.6 MILLION FOR THE YEARS ENDED MAY 31,

2001, 2000 AND 1999, RESPECTIVELY. INCLUDED IN PREPAID EXPENSES AND OTHER ASSETS

WAS $122.3 MILLION AND $158.7 MILLION AT MAY 31, 2001 AND 2000, RESPECTIVELY,

RELATING TO PREPAID ADVERTISING AND PROMOTION EXPENSES.

CASH AND EQUIVALENTS.

CASH AND EQUIVALENTS REPRESENT CASH AND SHORT-TERM, HIGHLY LIQUID

INVESTMENTS WITH ORIGINAL MATURITIES OF THREE MONTHS OR LESS.

INVENTORY VALUATION.

INVENTORIES ARE STATED AT THE LOWER OF COST OR MARKET. INVENTORIES ARE

VALUED ON A FIRST-IN, FIRST-OUT (FIFO) BASIS. DURING THE YEAR ENDED MAY 31,

1999, THE COMPANY CHANGED ITS METHOD OF DETERMINING COST FOR SUBSTANTIALLY ALL

OF ITS U.S. INVENTORIES FROM LAST-IN, FIRST-OUT (LIFO) TO FIFO. SEE NOTE 11.

PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT AND DEPRECIATION.

PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT ARE RECORDED AT COST. DEPRECIATION FOR

FINANCIAL REPORTING PURPOSES IS DETERMINED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS FOR

BUILDINGS AND LEASEHOLD IMPROVEMENTS OVER 2 TO 40 YEARS AND PRINCIPALLY ON A

DECLINING BALANCE BASIS FOR MACHINERY AND EQUIPMENT OVER 2 TO 15 YEARS. COMPUTER

SOFTWARE IS DEPRECIATED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER 3 TO 10 YEARS.

IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND GOODWILL.

AT MAY 31, 2001 AND 2000, THE COMPANY HAD PATENTS, TRADEMARKS AND OTHER

IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS RECORDED AT A COST OF $218.6 MILLION AND $215.2

MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. THE COMPANY'S EXCESS OF PURCHASE COST OVER THE FAIR VALUE

OF NET ASSETS OF BUSINESSES ACQUIRED (GOODWILL) WAS $322.5 MILLION AND $323.5

MILLION AT MAY 31, 2001 AND 2000, RESPECTIVELY.

IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND GOODWILL ARE BEING AMORTIZED OVER THEIR

ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER FIVE TO FORTY YEARS.

ACCUMULATED AMORTIZATION WAS $143.8 MILLION AND $127.8 MILLION AT

28

31

NIKE, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- (CONTINUED)

MAY 31, 2001 AND 2000, RESPECTIVELY. AMORTIZATION EXPENSE, WHICH IS INCLUDED IN

OTHER INCOME/EXPENSE, WAS $15.6 MILLION, $18.5 MILLION AND $19.4 MILLION FOR THE

YEARS ENDED MAY 31, 2001, 2000 AND 1999, RESPECTIVELY.

IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS.

WHEN EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THE CARRYING VALUE OF A LONG-LIVED

ASSET MAY BE IMPAIRED, THE COMPANY USES AN ESTIMATE OF THE FUTURE UNDISCOUNTED

CASH FLOWS TO BE DERIVED FROM THE REMAINING USEFUL LIFE OF THE ASSET TO ASSESS

WHETHER OR NOT THE ASSET IS RECOVERABLE. IF THE FUTURE UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS

TO BE DERIVED OVER THE LIFE OF THE ASSET DO NOT EXCEED THE ASSET'S NET BOOK

VALUE, THE COMPANY THEN CONSIDERS ESTIMATED FAIR MARKET VALUE VERSUS CARRYING

VALUE IN DETERMINING ANY POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT.

FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION AND FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSACTIONS.

ADJUSTMENTS RESULTING FROM TRANSLATING FOREIGN FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INTO U.S. DOLLARS ARE INCLUDED IN THE FOREIGN CURRENCY

TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENT, A COMPONENT OF ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME IN

SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY. GAINS AND LOSSES RESULTING FROM TRANSACTIONS THAT ARE MADE

IN A CURRENCY DIFFERENT FROM THE FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY OF THE APPLICABLE COMPANY

ENTITY ARE RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS AS THEY OCCUR OR, FOR HEDGING CONTRACTS, WHEN

THE UNDERLYING HEDGED TRANSACTION AFFECTS EARNINGS. FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSACTION

GAINS AND LOSSES WERE A $129.6 MILLION GAIN, A $36.1 MILLION GAIN, AND A $32.3

MILLION LOSS FOR THE YEARS ENDED MAY 31, 2001, 2000, AND 1999, RESPECTIVELY.

DERIVATIVES.

THE COMPANY ENTERS INTO FOREIGN CURRENCY CONTRACTS IN ORDER TO REDUCE THE

IMPACT OF CERTAIN FOREIGN CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS. FIRMLY COMMITTED TRANSACTIONS

AND THE RELATED RECEIVABLES AND PAYABLES MAY BE HEDGED WITH FORWARD EXCHANGE

CONTRACTS OR PURCHASED OPTIONS. ANTICIPATED, BUT NOT YET FIRMLY COMMITTED,

TRANSACTIONS MAY BE HEDGED THROUGH THE USE OF PURCHASED OPTIONS. PREMIUMS PAID

ON PURCHASED OPTIONS AND ANY REALIZED GAINS ARE INCLUDED IN PREPAID EXPENSES OR

ACCRUED LIABILITIES AND ARE RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS WHEN THE TRANSACTION BEING

HEDGED IS RECOGNIZED. GAINS AND LOSSES ARISING FROM FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD AND

OPTION CONTRACTS AND CROSS-CURRENCY SWAP TRANSACTIONS ARE RECOGNIZED IN INCOME

OR EXPENSE AS OFFSETS OF GAINS AND LOSSES RESULTING FROM THE UNDERLYING HEDGED

TRANSACTIONS. HEDGE EFFECTIVENESS IS DETERMINED BY EVALUATING WHETHER GAINS AND

LOSSES ON HEDGES WILL OFFSET GAINS AND LOSSES ON THE UNDERLYING EXPOSURES. THIS

EVALUATION IS PERFORMED AT INCEPTION OF THE HEDGE AND PERIODICALLY OVER THE LIFE

OF THE HEDGE. OCCASIONALLY, HEDGES MAY CEASE TO BE EFFECTIVE AND ARE THUS

TERMINATED PRIOR TO RECOGNITION OF THE UNDERLYING TRANSACTION. GAINS AND LOSSES

ON THESE HEDGES ARE DEFERRED UNTIL THE POINT IN TIME INEFFECTIVENESS IS

DETERMINED AND WILL BE INCLUDED IN THE BASIS OF THE UNDERLYING TRANSACTION.

HEDGES WILL ALSO BE TERMINATED IF THE UNDERLYING TRANSACTION IS NO LONGER

EXPECTED TO OCCUR. WHEN THIS OCCURS, ALL RELATED DEFERRED GAINS AND LOSSES ARE

RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS IMMEDIATELY. CASH FLOWS FROM HEDGING ACTIVITIES ARE

CLASSIFIED IN THE SAME CATEGORY AS THE CASH FLOWS FROM THE RELATED FOREIGN

EXCHANGE TRANSACTION ACTIVITY. SEE NOTE 15 FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION.

INCOME TAXES.

UNITED STATES INCOME TAXES ARE PROVIDED CURRENTLY ON FINANCIAL STATEMENT

EARNINGS OF NON-U.S. SUBSIDIARIES EXPECTED TO BE REPATRIATED. THE COMPANY

DETERMINES ANNUALLY THE AMOUNT OF UNDISTRIBUTED NON-U.S. EARNINGS TO INVEST

INDEFINITELY IN ITS NON-U.S. OPERATIONS. THE COMPANY ACCOUNTS FOR INCOME TAXES

USING THE ASSET AND LIABILITY METHOD. THIS APPROACH REQUIRES THE RECOGNITION OF

DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES FOR THE EXPECTED FUTURE TAX CONSEQUENCES OF

TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE CARRYING AMOUNTS AND THE TAX BASES OF OTHER

ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. SEE NOTE 6 FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION.

29

32

NIKE, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- (CONTINUED)

EARNINGS PER SHARE.

BASIC EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE IS CALCULATED BY DIVIDING NET INCOME BY THE

WEIGHTED AVERAGE NUMBER OF COMMON SHARES OUTSTANDING DURING THE YEAR. DILUTED

EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE IS CALCULATED BY ADJUSTING WEIGHTED AVERAGE

OUTSTANDING SHARES, ASSUMING CONVERSION OF ALL POTENTIALLY DILUTIVE STOCK

OPTIONS AND AWARDS. SEE NOTE 9 FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION.

MANAGEMENT ESTIMATES.

THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN CONFORMITY WITH GENERALLY

ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO MAKE ESTIMATES, INCLUDING

ESTIMATES RELATING TO ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS AND

LIABILITIES AND DISCLOSURE OF CONTINGENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AT THE DATE OF

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF REVENUES AND EXPENSES DURING

THE REPORTING PERIOD. ACTUAL RESULTS COULD DIFFER FROM THESE ESTIMATES.

RECLASSIFICATIONS.

CERTAIN PRIOR YEAR AMOUNTS HAVE BEEN RECLASSIFIED TO CONFORM TO FISCAL YEAR

2001 PRESENTATION. THESE CHANGES HAD NO IMPACT ON PREVIOUSLY REPORTED RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS OR SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY.

RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS.

EFFECTIVE JUNE 1, 2001, THE COMPANY WILL ADOPT STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL

ACCOUNTING STANDARDS ("SFAS") NO. 133, "ACCOUNTING FOR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS

AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES," AS AMENDED BY SFAS NO. 138, "ACCOUNTING FOR CERTAIN

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND CERTAIN HEDGING ACTIVITIES" (FAS 133).

AS REQUIRED UPON ADOPTION OF FAS 133, A ONE-TIME TRANSITION ADJUSTMENT WILL

BE RECORDED AS OF JUNE 1, 2001 ON BOTH THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF INCOME AND

CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET. THE COMPANY ESTIMATES THE TRANSITION ADJUSTMENT ON

THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF INCOME TO BE A CHARGE OF APPROXIMATELY $5.1

MILLION, NET OF TAX EFFECT. THIS AMOUNT RELATES TO AN INVESTMENT THAT WILL BE

ADJUSTED TO FAIR VALUE IN ACCORDANCE WITH FAS 133. THE TRANSITION ADJUSTMENT ON

THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET REPRESENTS THE INITIAL RECOGNITION OF THE FAIR

VALUES OF HEDGE DERIVATIVES OUTSTANDING ON THE ADOPTION DATE AND REALIZED GAINS

AND LOSSES ON EFFECTIVE HEDGES FOR WHICH THE UNDERLYING EXPOSURE HAS NOT YET

AFFECTED EARNINGS. THE TRANSITION ADJUSTMENT ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET

IS ESTIMATED TO BE AN INCREASE IN CURRENT ASSETS OF $118.5 MILLION, AN INCREASE

IN NONCURRENT ASSETS OF $87.0 MILLION, AN INCREASE IN CURRENT LIABILITIES OF

$151.6 MILLION, AND AN INCREASE IN OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME OF APPROXIMATELY

$59.0 MILLION, NET OF TAX EFFECTS.

THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO ADOPT SFAS NO. 142, "GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE

ASSETS" ON JUNE 1, 2002 (FAS 142). AS REQUIRED BY FAS 142, THE COMPANY WILL

PERFORM AN IMPAIRMENT TEST ON GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS AS OF THE

ADOPTION DATE. THEREAFTER, THE COMPANY WILL PERFORM IMPAIRMENT TESTS ANNUALLY

AND WHENEVER EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES OCCUR INDICATING THAT GOODWILL OR OTHER

INTANGIBLE ASSETS MIGHT BE IMPAIRED. AMORTIZATION OF GOODWILL AND CERTAIN OTHER

INTANGIBLE ASSETS, INCLUDING THOSE RECORDED IN PAST BUSINESS COMBINATIONS, WILL

CEASE. THE COMPANY HAS NOT YET DETERMINED WHAT THE IMPACT OF FAS 142 WILL BE ON

THE COMPANY'S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL POSITION.

U.S. OPERATIONS WERE FUNDED PRINCIPALLY WITH COMMERCIAL PAPER. AT MAY 31, 2001

THERE WAS $710.0 MILLION OUTSTANDING AND AT MAY 31, 2000 THERE WAS $691.9

MILLION OUTSTANDING UNDER THESE ARRANGEMENTS, NET OF DISCOUNTING.

THE COMPANY PURCHASES THROUGH NIAC CERTAIN ATHLETIC FOOTWEAR AND APPAREL IT

ACQUIRES FROM NON-U.S. SUPPLIERS. THESE PURCHASES ARE FOR THE COMPANY'S

OPERATIONS OUTSIDE OF THE U.S. AND EUROPE. ACCOUNTS PAYABLE TO NIAC ARE

GENERALLY DUE UP TO 60 DAYS AFTER SHIPMENT OF GOODS FROM THE FOREIGN PORT. THE

AT MAY 31, 2001, THE COMPANY HAD NO OUTSTANDING BORROWINGS UNDER ITS $1.25

BILLION COMMITTED CREDIT FACILITY WITH A GROUP OF 20 BANKS. THIS CREDIT FACILITY

HAS A 364-DAY REVOLVER (DUE 364 DAYS FROM THE BORROWING DATE) FOR $750.0 MILLION

AND A FIVE-YEAR REVOLVER (DUE FIVE YEARS FROM THE BORROWING DATE) FOR $500.0

MILLION. EACH YEAR, THE $750 MILLION, 364-DAY FACILITY CAN BE EXTENDED 364 DAYS,

AND THE $500 MILLION, FIVE-YEAR FACILITY CAN BE EXTENDED ONE YEAR. BASED ON THE

PREVAILING LIBOR RATE PLUS 0.24%, AND THE INTEREST RATE CHARGED ON ANY

OUTSTANDING BORROWINGS ON THE $500.0 MILLION REVOLVER WOULD BE THE PREVAILING

THE LTIP, AWARDS ARE MADE TO CERTAIN EXECUTIVES BASED ON PERFORMANCE TARGETS

ESTABLISHED OVER VARYING TIME PERIODS. ONCE PERFORMANCE TARGETS ARE ACHIEVED,

THE SHARES OF STOCK ARE ISSUED AND REMAIN RESTRICTED FOR AN ADDITIONAL THREE

YEARS, SUBJECT TO FORFEITURE IF THE EXECUTIVE'S EMPLOYMENT TERMINATES WITHIN

THAT PERIOD. PLAN PARTICIPANTS ARE ENTITLED TO CASH DIVIDENDS AND TO VOTE THEIR

RESPECTIVE SHARES. THE VALUE OF THE RESTRICTED SHARES IS ESTABLISHED BY THE

STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS NO. 123, "ACCOUNTING FOR

STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION," (FAS 123) DEFINES A FAIR VALUE METHOD OF ACCOUNTING

FOR EMPLOYEE STOCK COMPENSATION AND ENCOURAGES, BUT DOES NOT REQUIRE, ALL

ENTITIES TO ADOPT THAT METHOD OF ACCOUNTING. ENTITIES ELECTING NOT TO ADOPT THE

FAIR VALUE METHOD OF ACCOUNTING MUST MAKE PRO FORMA DISCLOSURES OF NET INCOME

AND EARNINGS PER SHARE, AS IF THE FAIR VALUE BASED METHOD OF ACCOUNTING DEFINED

IN THIS STATEMENT HAD BEEN APPLIED.

THE COMPANY HAS ELECTED NOT TO ADOPT THE FAIR VALUE METHOD; HOWEVER, AS

REQUIRED BY FAS 123, THE COMPANY HAS COMPUTED FOR PRO FORMA DISCLOSURE PURPOSES,

THE FAIR VALUE OF OPTIONS GRANTED DURING THE YEARS ENDED MAY 31, 2001, 2000 AND

THESE INTEREST RATES ARE REFLECTIVE OF OPTION GRANT DATES THROUGHOUT THE YEAR.

OPTIONS WERE ASSUMED TO BE EXERCISED OVER THE 5 YEAR EXPECTED LIFE FOR

PURPOSES OF THIS VALUATION. ADJUSTMENTS FOR FORFEITURES ARE MADE AS THEY OCCUR.

FOR THE YEARS ENDED MAY 31, 2001, 2000 AND 1999, THE TOTAL VALUE OF THE OPTIONS

GRANTED, FOR WHICH NO PREVIOUS EXPENSE HAS BEEN RECOGNIZED, WAS COMPUTED AS

APPROXIMATELY $5.0 MILLION, $129.8 MILLION AND $61.6 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY,

WHICH WOULD BE AMORTIZED ON A STRAIGHT LINE BASIS OVER THE VESTING PERIOD OF THE

OPTIONS. THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE FAIR VALUE PER SHARE OF THE OPTIONS GRANTED IN THE

DURING THE YEAR ENDED MAY 31, 2000, A $1.1 MILLION RESERVE ESTABLISHED AS

PART OF A RESTRUCTURING CHARGE IN THE YEAR ENDED MAY 31, 1998 WAS REVERSED DUE

TO CHANGES IN OUTSTANDING LEASE COMMITMENTS.

NOTE 14 -- FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS.

THE CARRYING AMOUNTS REFLECTED IN THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET FOR CASH

AND EQUIVALENTS AND NOTES PAYABLE APPROXIMATE FAIR VALUE DUE TO THE SHORT

MATURITIES. THE FAIR VALUE OF LONG-TERM DEBT IS ESTIMATED USING DISCOUNTED CASH

FLOW ANALYSES, BASED ON THE COMPANY'S INCREMENTAL BORROWING RATES FOR SIMILAR

TYPES OF BORROWING ARRANGEMENTS. THE FAIR VALUE OF THE COMPANY'S LONG-TERM DEBT,

INCLUDING CURRENT PORTION, IS APPROXIMATELY $437.8 MILLION, COMPARED TO A

CARRYING VALUE OF $441.3 MILLION AT MAY 31, 2001 AND $509.9 MILLION, COMPARED TO

A CARRYING VALUE OF $520.4 MILLION AT MAY 31, 2000. SEE NOTE 15 FOR FAIR VALUE

OF DERIVATIVES.

NOTE 15 -- FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT AND DERIVATIVES.

THE PURPOSE OF THE COMPANY'S FOREIGN CURRENCY HEDGING ACTIVITIES IS TO

PROTECT THE COMPANY FROM THE RISK THAT THE EVENTUAL CASH FLOWS RESULTING FROM

THE SALE AND PURCHASE OF PRODUCTS IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES WILL BE ADVERSELY

AFFECTED BY CHANGES IN EXCHANGE RATES. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY SEEKS TO MANAGE

THE IMPACT OF FOREIGN CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS RELATED TO THE REPAYMENT OF

INTERCOMPANY TRANSACTIONS, INCLUDING INTERCOMPANY BORROWINGS. THE COMPANY DOES

NOT HOLD OR ISSUE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS FOR TRADING PURPOSES. IT IS THE

COMPANY'S POLICY TO UTILIZE DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS TO REDUCE FOREIGN

EXCHANGE RISKS WHERE INTERNAL NETTING STRATEGIES CANNOT BE EFFECTIVELY EMPLOYED.

FLUCTUATIONS IN THE VALUE OF HEDGING INSTRUMENTS ARE OFFSET BY FLUCTUATIONS IN

THE VALUE OF THE UNDERLYING EXPOSURES BEING HEDGED.

THE COMPANY USES FORWARD EXCHANGE CONTRACTS AND PURCHASED OPTIONS TO HEDGE

CERTAIN FIRM PURCHASES AND SALES COMMITMENTS AND THE RELATED PAYABLES AND

RECEIVABLES, INCLUDING OTHER THIRD PARTY OR INTERCOMPANY FOREIGN CURRENCY

TRANSACTIONS, AND USES PURCHASED CURRENCY OPTIONS TO HEDGE CERTAIN ANTICIPATED

BUT NOT YET FIRMLY COMMITTED TRANSACTIONS. CROSS-CURRENCY SWAPS ARE USED TO

HEDGE FOREIGN CURRENCY DENOMINATED PAYMENTS RELATED TO INTERCOMPANY LOAN

AGREEMENTS. HEDGED TRANSACTIONS ARE DENOMINATED PRIMARILY IN EUROPEAN

CURRENCIES, JAPANESE YEN, AUSTRALIAN DOLLARS, CANADIAN DOLLARS, AND KOREAN WON.

PREMIUMS PAID ON PURCHASED OPTIONS AND ANY REALIZED GAINS ARE INCLUDED IN

PREPAID EXPENSES OR ACCRUED LIABILITIES AND RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS WHEN THE

UNDERLYING TRANSACTION IS RECOGNIZED. DEFERRED OPTION PREMIUM COST, NET OF

REALIZED GAINS, WAS $6.1 MILLION OF NET COST AT MAY 31, 2001. DEFERRED OPTION

PREMIUM COST, NET OF REALIZED GAINS, WAS

39

NIKE, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- (CONTINUED)

$3.8 MILLION OF NET BENEFIT AT MAY 31, 2000. RESULTS RELATED TO HEDGES OF FIRMLY

COMMITTED TRANSACTIONS AND THE RELATED RECEIVABLES AND PAYABLES ARE DEFERRED AND

ARE RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS OR AS ADJUSTMENTS OF CARRYING AMOUNTS WHEN THE

OFFSETTING RESULTS ARE RECOGNIZED ON THE UNDERLYING TRANSACTION. NET REALIZED

AND UNREALIZED GAINS ON FORWARD CONTRACTS DEFERRED AT MAY 31, 2001 AND 2000 WERE

$15.8 MILLION AND $42.8 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY.

THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUES OF DERIVATIVES USED TO HEDGE THE COMPANY'S RISKS

WILL FLUCTUATE OVER TIME. THE FAIR VALUE OF THE FORWARD EXCHANGE CONTRACTS AND

CROSS-CURRENCY SWAPS ARE ESTIMATED BY OBTAINING QUOTED MARKET PRICES. THE FAIR

VALUE OF OPTION CONTRACTS IS ESTIMATED USING OPTION PRICING MODELS WIDELY USED

IN THE FINANCIAL MARKETS. THESE FAIR VALUE AMOUNTS SHOULD NOT BE VIEWED IN

ISOLATION, BUT RATHER IN RELATION TO THE FAIR VALUES OF THE UNDERLYING HEDGED

TRANSACTIONS AND THE OVERALL REDUCTION IN THE COMPANY'S EXPOSURE TO ADVERSE

FLUCTUATIONS IN FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES. THE NOTIONAL AMOUNTS OF DERIVATIVES

SUMMARIZED BELOW DO NOT NECESSARILY REPRESENT AMOUNTS EXCHANGED BY THE PARTIES

AND, THEREFORE, ARE NOT A DIRECT MEASURE OF THE EXPOSURE TO THE COMPANY THROUGH

ITS USE OF DERIVATIVES. THE AMOUNTS EXCHANGED ARE CALCULATED ON THE BASIS OF THE

NOTIONAL AMOUNTS AND THE OTHER TERMS OF THE DERIVATIVES, WHICH RELATE TO

INTEREST RATES, EXCHANGE RATES OR OTHER FINANCIAL INDICES.

THE FOLLOWING TABLE PRESENTS THE AGGREGATE NOTIONAL PRINCIPAL AMOUNTS,

CARRYING VALUES AND FAIR VALUES OF THE COMPANY'S DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL

INSTRUMENTS OUTSTANDING AT MAY 31, 2001 AND 2000.

CARRYING VALUES PRIMARILY REPRESENT AMOUNTS RECOGNIZED FOR UNREALIZED GAINS

AND LOSSES ON CONTRACTS WHICH DO NOT MEET THE CRITERIA FOR DEFERRAL ACCOUNTING

AND UNAMORTIZED PREMIUMS PAID ON OPTION CONTRACTS.

THE NET FAIR VALUE OF OUTSTANDING FORWARD CONTRACTS OF $51.7 MILLION AS OF

MAY 31, 2001 WAS COMPRISED OF UNREALIZED FAIR VALUE LOSSES OF $22.9 MILLION AND

UNREALIZED FAIR VALUE GAINS OF $74.6 MILLION. THE NET FAIR VALUE OF OUTSTANDING

FORWARD CONTRACTS OF $62.1 MILLION AS OF MAY 31, 2000 WAS COMPRISED OF

UNREALIZED FAIR VALUE LOSSES OF $16.4 MILLION AND UNREALIZED FAIR VALUE GAINS OF

$78.5 MILLION.

THE NORMAL TERM OF FOREIGN EXCHANGE FORWARD AND OPTION CONTRACTS ENTERED

INTO IS ONE YEAR OR LESS. THE CURRENCY SWAPS HAVE MATURITY DATES CONSISTENT WITH

THE MATURITY DATES OF THE RELATED INTERCOMPANY LOAN WHICH MATURES PARTIALLY

DURING THE YEAR ENDING MAY 31, 2003 AND DURING THE YEAR ENDING MAY 31, 2004. ALL

REALIZED RESULTS DEFERRED AT MAY 31, 2001 WILL BE RECORDED IN EARNINGS WITHIN

ONE YEAR.

THE COMPANY IS EXPOSED TO CREDIT-RELATED LOSSES IN THE EVENT OF

NON-PERFORMANCE BY COUNTERPARTIES TO HEDGING INSTRUMENTS. THE COUNTERPARTIES TO

DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS ARE MAJOR FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS WITH HIGH INVESTMENT

GRADE CREDIT RATINGS AND, ADDITIONALLY, COUNTERPARTIES TO DERIVATIVES THREE

YEARS OR GREATER ARE AA+ OR BETTER RATED. HOWEVER, THIS DOES NOT ELIMINATE THE

COMPANY'S EXPOSURE TO CREDIT RISK WITH THESE INSTITUTIONS. THIS CREDIT RISK IS

GENERALLY LIMITED TO THE UNREALIZED GAINS IN SUCH CONTRACTS SHOULD ANY OF THESE

COUNTERPARTIES FAIL TO PERFORM AS CONTRACTED. TO MANAGE THIS RISK, THE COMPANY

HAS ESTABLISHED STRICT COUNTERPARTY CREDIT GUIDELINES WHICH ARE CONTINUALLY

MONITORED AND REPORTED TO SENIOR MANAGEMENT ACCORDING TO PRESCRIBED GUIDELINES.

THE COMPANY UTILIZES A PORTFOLIO OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS EITHER HEADQUARTERED

OR OPERATING IN THE

40

NIKE, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- (CONTINUED)

SAME COUNTRIES THE COMPANY CONDUCTS ITS BUSINESS. AS A RESULT OF THE ABOVE

CONSIDERATIONS, THE COMPANY CONSIDERS THE RISK OF COUNTERPARTY DEFAULT TO BE

MINIMAL.

IN ADDITION TO HEDGING INSTRUMENTS, THE COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO

CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK ASSOCIATED WITH CASH AND EQUIVALENTS AND ACCOUNTS

RECEIVABLE. THE COMPANY PLACES CASH AND EQUIVALENTS WITH FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS

WITH INVESTMENT GRADE CREDIT RATINGS AND, BY POLICY, LIMITS THE AMOUNT OF CREDIT

EXPOSURE TO ANY ONE FINANCIAL INSTITUTION. THE COMPANY CONSIDERS ITS

CONCENTRATION RISK RELATED TO ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE TO BE MITIGATED BY THE

COMPANY'S CREDIT POLICY, THE SIGNIFICANCE OF OUTSTANDING BALANCES OWED BY EACH

INDIVIDUAL CUSTOMER AT ANY POINT IN TIME AND THE GEOGRAPHIC DISPERSION OF THESE

CUSTOMERS.

NOTE 16 -- OPERATING SEGMENTS AND RELATED INFORMATION.

OPERATING SEGMENTS. FOR SUBSIDIARIES PARTICIPATING IN NIKE BRAND SALES

ACTIVITY, THE COMPANY'S MAJOR OPERATING SEGMENTS ARE DEFINED BY GEOGRAPHIC

REGIONS. OTHER BRANDS AS SHOWN BELOW REPRESENT ACTIVITY FOR OUR SUBSIDIARIES

COLE HAAN HOLDINGS, INC., BAUER NIKE HOCKEY INC., AND NIKE IHM, INC., AND ARE

CONSIDERED IMMATERIAL FOR INDIVIDUAL DISCLOSURE. IN PRIOR YEARS, THE COMPANY'S

OPERATIONS IN AFRICA WERE INCLUDED IN THE AMERICAS REGION, BUT EFFECTIVE JUNE 1,

2000, THESE OPERATIONS ARE INCLUDED IN THE EMEA (EUROPE, MIDDLE EAST, AND

AFRICA) REGION. AFRICA INFORMATION AND CERTAIN OTHER PRIOR YEAR SEGMENT

INFORMATION HAS BEEN RECLASSIFIED TO CONFORM WITH CURRENT YEAR PRESENTATION.

WHERE APPLICABLE, "CORPORATE" REPRESENTS ITEMS NECESSARY TO RECONCILE TO THE

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS; THESE ITEMS GENERALLY INCLUDE CORPORATE

ACTIVITY AND CORPORATE ELIMINATIONS. THE SEGMENTS ARE EVIDENCE OF THE STRUCTURE

OF THE COMPANY'S INTERNAL ORGANIZATION. EACH NIKE BRAND GEOGRAPHIC SEGMENT

OPERATES PREDOMINANTLY IN ONE INDUSTRY: THE DESIGN, PRODUCTION, MARKETING AND

SELLING OF SPORTS AND FITNESS FOOTWEAR, APPAREL, AND EQUIPMENT.

NET REVENUES AS SHOWN BELOW REPRESENT SALES TO EXTERNAL CUSTOMERS FOR EACH

SEGMENT. INTERCOMPANY REVENUES HAVE BEEN ELIMINATED AND ARE IMMATERIAL FOR

SEPARATE DISCLOSURE. THE COMPANY CENTRALLY MANAGES INTEREST EXPENSE. OPERATING

SEGMENT INTEREST IS PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF INTERCOMPANY LENDING, WHICH IS

ELIMINATED FOR CONSOLIDATED PURPOSES. THE COMPANY EVALUATES PERFORMANCE OF

INDIVIDUAL OPERATING SEGMENTS BASED ON CONTRIBUTION PROFIT BEFORE CORPORATE

ALLOCATIONS AND INCOME TAXES (REFERRED TO AS MANAGEMENT PRE-TAX INCOME). ON A

CONSOLIDATED BASIS, THIS AMOUNT REPRESENTS INCOME BEFORE TAXES AS SHOWN IN THE

CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME. RECONCILING ITEMS FOR MANAGEMENT PRE-TAX

INCOME REPRESENT CORPORATE COSTS THAT ARE NOT ALLOCATED TO THE OPERATING

SEGMENTS FOR MANAGEMENT REPORTING AND INTERCOMPANY ELIMINATIONS FOR SPECIFIC

INCOME STATEMENT ITEMS.

ADDITIONS TO LONG-LIVED ASSETS PREDOMINANTLY REPRESENT CAPITAL

EXPENDITURES, WHICH ARE SHOWN BELOW BY OPERATING SEGMENT. OTHER ADDITIONS TO

LONG-LIVED ASSETS REPRESENT ADDITIONS TO IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLES AND GOODWILL,

WHICH ARE IMMATERIAL FOR DISCLOSURE. AMORTIZATION OF IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE

ASSETS AND GOODWILL IS CONSIDERED A CORPORATE EXPENSE AND IS NOT ATTRIBUTABLE TO

ANY SPECIFIC OPERATING SEGMENT. SEE NOTE 1 FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION ON

IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND GOODWILL.
