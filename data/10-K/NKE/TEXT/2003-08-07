FINANCIAL INFORMATION

ABOUT GEOGRAPHIC AND SEGMENT OPERATIONS APPEARS IN NOTE 17 OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ON PAGE 59.

WE EXPERIENCE MODERATE FLUCTUATIONS IN AGGREGATE SALES VOLUME DURING THE YEAR. HOWEVER, THE MIX OF PRODUCT SALES MAY VARY CONSIDERABLY FROM TIME TO TIME

AS A RESULT OF CHANGES IN SEASONAL AND GEOGRAPHIC DEMAND FOR PARTICULAR TYPES OF FOOTWEAR, APPAREL, AND EQUIPMENT.

BECAUSE NIKE IS A CONSUMER PRODUCTS COMPANY, THE RELATIVE POPULARITY OF VARIOUS SPORTS AND FITNESS ACTIVITIES AND CHANGING DESIGN TRENDS AFFECT THE DEMAND

FOR OUR PRODUCTS. WE MUST THEREFORE RESPOND TO TRENDS

3

TABLE OF CONTENTS

AND SHIFTS IN CONSUMER PREFERENCES BY ADJUSTING THE MIX OF EXISTING PRODUCT OFFERINGS, DEVELOPING NEW PRODUCTS, STYLES AND CATEGORIES, AND INFLUENCING SPORTS

AND FITNESS PREFERENCES THROUGH AGGRESSIVE MARKETING. THIS IS A CONTINUING RISK. FAILURE TO TIMELY AND ADEQUATELY RESPOND COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE AFFECT ON OUR SALES AND PROFITABILITY.

UNITED STATES MARKET

DURING

FISCAL 2003, SALES IN THE UNITED STATES ACCOUNTED FOR APPROXIMATELY 49 PERCENT OF TOTAL REVENUES, COMPARED TO 53 PERCENT IN FISCAL 2002 AND 54 PERCENT IN FISCAL 2001. WE SELL TO APPROXIMATELY 18,000 RETAIL ACCOUNTS IN THE UNITED STATES. THE

NIKE BRAND DOMESTIC RETAIL ACCOUNT BASE INCLUDES A MIX OF FOOTWEAR STORES, SPORTING GOODS STORES, ATHLETIC SPECIALTY STORES, DEPARTMENT STORES, SKATE, TENNIS AND GOLF SHOPS, AND OTHER RETAIL ACCOUNTS. DURING FISCAL YEAR 2003, OUR THREE LARGEST

CUSTOMERS ACCOUNTED FOR APPROXIMATELY 27 PERCENT OF NIKE BRAND SALES IN THE UNITED STATES EXCLUDING SALES FROM NIKE GOLF AND BAUER NIKE HOCKEY, AND 24 PERCENT OF TOTAL SALES IN THE UNITED STATES.

WE MAKE SUBSTANTIAL USE OF OUR FUTURES ORDERING PROGRAM, WHICH

ALLOWS RETAILERS TO ORDER FIVE TO SIX MONTHS IN ADVANCE OF DELIVERY WITH THE COMMITMENT THAT 90 PERCENT OF THEIR ORDERS WILL BE DELIVERED WITHIN A SET TIME PERIOD AT A FIXED PRICE. IN FISCAL YEAR 2003, 91 PERCENT OF OUR U.S. FOOTWEAR SHIPMENTS

(EXCLUDING COLE HAAN, BAUER, HURLEY AND NIKE GOLF) WERE MADE UNDER THE FUTURES PROGRAM, COMPARED TO 92 PERCENT IN FISCAL 2002 AND 86 PERCENT IN FISCAL 2001. IN FISCAL 2003, 67 PERCENT OF OUR U.S. APPAREL SHIPMENTS WERE MADE UNDER THE FUTURES

PROGRAM, COMPARED TO 69 PERCENT IN FISCAL 2002, AND 67 PERCENT IN 2001.

WE UTILIZE 19 NIKE SALES OFFICES TO SOLICIT SALES IN THE UNITED STATES. WE ALSO UTILIZE 11 INDEPENDENT SALES REPRESENTATIVES TO SELL SPECIALTY PRODUCTS FOR GOLF, CYCLING, WATER SPORTS AND OUTDOOR ACTIVITIES. IN ADDITION, WE OPERATE THE

FOLLOWING RETAIL OUTLETS IN THE UNITED STATES.

PRIMARILY FROM GREENLAND, NEW HAMPSHIRE, AND HURLEY PRODUCTS ARE SHIPPED FROM COSTA MESA, CALIFORNIA.

INTERNATIONAL MARKETS

WE

CURRENTLY MARKET OUR PRODUCTS IN NEARLY 200 COUNTRIES OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES THROUGH INDEPENDENT DISTRIBUTORS, LICENSEES, SUBSIDIARIES AND BRANCH OFFICES. NON-U.S. SALES ACCOUNTED FOR 51 PERCENT OF TOTAL REVENUES IN FISCAL 2003, COMPARED TO 47

PERCENT IN FISCAL 2002 AND 46 PERCENT IN FISCAL 2001. WE OPERATE 24 DISTRIBUTION CENTERS IN EUROPE, ASIA, AUSTRALIA, LATIN AMERICA, AFRICA AND CANADA, AND ALSO DISTRIBUTE THROUGH INDEPENDENT DISTRIBUTORS AND LICENSEES. WE ESTIMATE THAT OUR PRODUCTS

ARE SOLD THROUGH MORE THAN 30,000 RETAIL ACCOUNTS OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES. IN MANY COUNTRIES AND REGIONS, INCLUDING JAPAN, CANADA, ASIA, SOME LATIN AMERICAN COUNTRIES, AND EUROPE, WE HAVE A FUTURES ORDERING PROGRAM FOR RETAILERS SIMILAR TO THE

UNITED STATES FUTURES PROGRAM DESCRIBED ABOVE. NIKES THREE LARGEST CUSTOMERS OUTSIDE OF THE U.S. ACCOUNTED FOR APPROXIMATELY 14 PERCENT OF NON-U.S. SALES.

WE OPERATE 175 RETAIL OUTLETS OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES, WHICH CONSIST OF NIKETOWNS, FACTORY STORES, EMPLOYEE STORES, AND

COLE HAAN STORES.

ORDERS

WORLDWIDE FUTURES FOR NIKE

BRAND ATHLETIC FOOTWEAR AND APPAREL, SCHEDULED FOR DELIVERY BETWEEN JUNE AND NOVEMBER 2003, WERE $4.9 BILLION COMPARED TO $4.6 BILLION FOR THE SAME PERIOD LAST YEAR. BASED UPON HISTORICAL DATA, WE EXPECT THAT APPROXIMATELY 95 PERCENT OF THESE ORDERS

WILL BE FILLED IN THAT TIME PERIOD, ALTHOUGH THE ORDERS MAY BE CANCELLED.

PRODUCT RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

WE BELIEVE THAT OUR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS ARE A KEY FACTOR IN OUR PAST AND FUTURE SUCCESS. TECHNICAL INNOVATION IN THE DESIGN OF FOOTWEAR, APPAREL, AND ATHLETIC EQUIPMENT RECEIVE CONTINUED EMPHASIS AS NIKE STRIVES TO PRODUCE

PRODUCTS THAT REDUCE OR ELIMINATE INJURY, AID ATHLETIC PERFORMANCE AND MAXIMIZE COMFORT.

IN ADDITION TO NIKES OWN STAFF OF SPECIALISTS IN THE AREAS OF BIOMECHANICS, EXERCISE PHYSIOLOGY, ENGINEERING, INDUSTRIAL DESIGN AND RELATED FIELDS, WE ALSO UTILIZE RESEARCH COMMITTEES AND ADVISORY BOARDS MADE UP

OF ATHLETES, COACHES, TRAINERS, EQUIPMENT MANAGERS, ORTHOPEDISTS, PODIATRISTS AND OTHER EXPERTS WHO CONSULT WITH US AND REVIEW DESIGNS, MATERIALS AND CONCEPTS FOR PRODUCT IMPROVEMENT. EMPLOYEE ATHLETES WEAR-TEST AND EVALUATE PRODUCTS DURING THE

DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT PROCESS.

MANUFACTURING

IN FISCAL 2003,

APPROXIMATELY 1 PERCENT OF TOTAL NIKE BRAND APPAREL PRODUCTION FOR SALE TO THE UNITED STATES MARKET WAS MANUFACTURED IN THE UNITED STATES BY INDEPENDENT CONTRACT MANUFACTURERS, MOST OF WHICH ARE LOCATED IN THE SOUTHERN STATES. THE REMAINDER WAS

MANUFACTURED BY INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS LOCATED IN 35 COUNTRIES. MOST OF THIS APPAREL PRODUCTION OCCURRED IN BANGLADESH, BULGARIA, CHINA, HONG KONG, INDIA, INDONESIA, MALAYSIA, MEXICO, PAKISTAN, THE PHILIPPINES, SRI LANKA, TAIWAN, THAILAND, AND

TURKEY. SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR APPAREL PRODUCTION FOR SALE TO THE INTERNATIONAL MARKET WAS MANUFACTURED OUTSIDE THE U.S. OUR LARGEST SINGLE APPAREL SUPPLIER ACCOUNTED FOR APPROXIMATELY 7 PERCENT OF TOTAL FISCAL 2003 APPAREL PRODUCTION.

VIRTUALLY ALL OF OUR FOOTWEAR IS PRODUCED OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES. IN

FISCAL 2003, CONTRACT SUPPLIERS IN THE FOLLOWING COUNTRIES MANUFACTURED THE FOLLOWING PERCENTAGES OF TOTAL NIKE BRAND FOOTWEAR.

2003 FOOTWEAR PRODUCTION.

THE PRINCIPAL MATERIALS USED IN OUR

FOOTWEAR PRODUCTS ARE NATURAL AND SYNTHETIC RUBBER, PLASTIC COMPOUNDS, FOAM CUSHIONING MATERIALS, NYLON, LEATHER, CANVAS, AND POLYURETHANE FILMS USED TO MAKE AIR-SOLE CUSHIONING

5

TABLE OF CONTENTS

COMPONENTS. NIKE IHM, INC., A WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARY OF NIKE, IS OUR SOLE SUPPLIER OF THE AIR-SOLE CUSHIONING COMPONENTS USED IN FOOTWEAR. THE PRINCIPAL

MATERIALS USED IN OUR APPAREL PRODUCTS ARE NATURAL AND SYNTHETIC FABRICS AND THREADS, PLASTIC AND METAL HARDWARE, AND SPECIALIZED PERFORMANCE FABRICS DESIGNED TO REPEL RAIN, RETAIN HEAT, OR EFFICIENTLY TRANSPORT BODY MOISTURE. NIKE AND ITS

CONTRACTORS AND SUPPLIERS BUY RAW MATERIALS IN BULK. MOST RAW MATERIALS ARE AVAILABLE IN THE COUNTRIES WHERE MANUFACTURING TAKES PLACE. WE HAVE THUS FAR EXPERIENCED LITTLE DIFFICULTY IN SATISFYING OUR RAW MATERIAL REQUIREMENTS.

OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS ARE SUBJECT TO THE USUAL RISKS OF DOING BUSINESS

ABROAD, SUCH AS POSSIBLE REVALUATION OF CURRENCIES, EXPORT DUTIES, QUOTAS, RESTRICTIONS ON THE TRANSFER OF FUNDS AND, IN CERTAIN PARTS OF THE WORLD, POLITICAL INSTABILITY. SEE TRADE LEGISLATION BELOW. WE HAVE NOT, TO DATE, BEEN

MATERIALLY AFFECTED BY ANY SUCH RISK, BUT CANNOT PREDICT THE LIKELIHOOD OF SUCH DEVELOPMENTS OCCURRING. WE BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO DEVELOP, OVER A PERIOD OF TIME, ADEQUATE ALTERNATIVE SOURCES OF SUPPLY FOR THE PRODUCTS OBTAINED FROM OUR

PRESENT SUPPLIERS OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES. IF EVENTS PREVENTED US FROM ACQUIRING PRODUCTS FROM OUR SUPPLIERS IN A PARTICULAR COUNTRY, OUR FOOTWEAR OPERATIONS COULD BE TEMPORARILY DISRUPTED AND WE COULD EXPERIENCE AN ADVERSE FINANCIAL IMPACT.

HOWEVER, WE BELIEVE THAT WE COULD ELIMINATE ANY SUCH DISRUPTION WITHIN A PERIOD OF NO MORE THAN 12 MONTHS, AND THAT ANY ADVERSE IMPACT WOULD, THEREFORE, BE OF A SHORT-TERM NATURE. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR PRINCIPAL COMPETITORS ARE SUBJECT TO SIMILAR

RISKS.

ALL OF OUR PRODUCTS MANUFACTURED OVERSEAS AND IMPORTED

INTO THE UNITED STATES AND OTHER COUNTRIES ARE SUBJECT TO CUSTOMS DUTIES COLLECTED BY CUSTOMS AUTHORITIES. CUSTOMS INFORMATION SUBMITTED BY US IS ROUTINELY SUBJECT TO REVIEW BY CUSTOMS AUTHORITIES. WE ARE UNABLE TO PREDICT WHETHER ADDITIONAL CUSTOMS

DUTIES, QUOTAS OR OTHER RESTRICTIONS MAY BE IMPOSED ON THE IMPORTATION OF OUR PRODUCTS IN THE FUTURE. THE ENACTMENT OF ANY SUCH DUTIES, QUOTAS OR RESTRICTIONS COULD RESULT IN INCREASES IN THE COST OF OUR PRODUCTS GENERALLY AND MIGHT ADVERSELY AFFECT

THE SALES OR PROFITABILITY OF NIKE AND THE IMPORTED FOOTWEAR AND APPAREL INDUSTRY AS A WHOLE.

SINCE 1972, NISSHO IWAI AMERICAN CORPORATION (NIAC), A SUBSIDIARY OF NISSHO IWAI CORPORATION, A LARGE JAPANESE TRADING COMPANY, HAS PERFORMED SIGNIFICANT IMPORT-EXPORT FINANCING SERVICES FOR US. CURRENTLY,

NIAC PROVIDES SUCH FINANCING SERVICES WITH RESPECT TO AT LEAST 80% OF THE NIKE PRODUCTS SOLD OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES, EUROPE AND JAPAN. APPROXIMATELY 12% OF NIKE PRODUCTS ARE SOLD OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES, EUROPE AND JAPAN. ANY FAILURE OF

NIAC TO PROVIDE THESE SERVICES OR ANY FAILURE OF NIACS BANKS COULD DISRUPT OUR ABILITY TO ACQUIRE PRODUCTS FROM OUR SUPPLIERS AND TO DELIVER PRODUCTS TO OUR CUSTOMERS OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES, EUROPE AND JAPAN. SUCH A DISRUPTION COULD

RESULT IN CANCELLED ORDERS THAT WOULD ADVERSELY AFFECT SALES AND PROFITABILITY. HOWEVER, WE BELIEVE THAT ANY SUCH DISRUPTION WOULD BE SHORT TERM IN DURATION DUE TO THE READY AVAILABILITY OF ALTERNATIVE SOURCES OF FINANCING AT COMPETITIVE RATES. OUR

CURRENT AGREEMENTS WITH NIAC EXPIRE ON MAY 31, 2005.

TRADE LEGISLATION

OUR NON-U.S.

OPERATIONS ARE SUBJECT TO THE USUAL RISKS OF DOING BUSINESS ABROAD, SUCH AS THE IMPOSITION OF IMPORT QUOTAS OR ANTI-DUMPING DUTIES. IN 1994, THE EUROPEAN UNION (EU) COMMISSION IMPOSED QUOTAS ON CERTAIN TYPES OF FOOTWEAR MANUFACTURED IN

CHINA. THESE QUOTAS REPLACED NATIONAL QUOTAS THAT HAD PREVIOUSLY BEEN IN EFFECT IN SEVERAL MEMBER STATES. FOOTWEAR DESIGNED FOR USE IN SPORTING ACTIVITIES, MEETING CERTAIN TECHNICAL CRITERIA AND HAVING A CIF (COST, INSURANCE AND FREIGHT) PRICE ABOVE

9 EUROS (SPECIAL TECHNOLOGY ATHLETIC FOOTWEAR OR STAF), IS EXCLUDED FROM THE QUOTAS. AS A RESULT OF THE STAF EXCLUSION, AND THE AMOUNT OF QUOTA MADE AVAILABLE TO US, THE QUOTAS HAVE NOT, TO DATE, HAD A MATERIAL EFFECT ON OUR

BUSINESS. IN ADDITION, THE EU COMMISSION HAS ANNOUNCED THAT FOOTWEAR QUOTAS WILL BE ELIMINATED GLOBALLY BEGINNING JANUARY 1, 2005.

IN 1995, THE EU COMMISSION, AT THE REQUEST OF EUROPEAN FOOTWEAR MANUFACTURERS, INITIATED TWO ANTI-DUMPING INVESTIGATIONS WITHIN THE FOOTWEAR INDUSTRY

COVERING FOOTWEAR IMPORTED FROM THE PEOPLES REPUBLIC OF CHINA, INDONESIA AND THAILAND. AS A RESULT, IN 1997 THE COMMISSION IMPOSED DEFINITIVE ANTI-DUMPING DUTIES ON CERTAIN TEXTILE UPPER FOOTWEAR IMPORTED FROM CHINA AND INDONESIA. IN 1998, THE

COMMISSION IMPOSED DEFINITIVE ANTI-DUMPING DUTIES ON CERTAIN SYNTHETIC AND LEATHER UPPER FOOTWEAR ORIGINATING IN CHINA, INDONESIA AND THAILAND. THESE ANTI-DUMPING DUTIES WERE REMOVED IN 2003 AND ARE NO LONGER APPLICABLE FOR FOOTWEAR IMPORTS INTO THE

EU. THESE MEASURES HAD NO IMPACT ON US.

6

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE EU COMMISSION IN JUNE 2000 ISSUED AN AMENDMENT TO THE EXPLANATORY NOTES TO THE EUS CUSTOMS

NOMENCLATURE (CN). THE AMENDMENT, WHICH IS NOT LEGALLY BINDING, INTERPRETS SOME OF THE TECHNICAL CRITERIA FOR THE STAF EXCLUSION AND THE FOOTWEAR TYPES THAT CAN BE CLASSIFIED AS FOR USE IN SPORTING ACTIVITY. THE AMENDMENT RESTRICTS

SOMEWHAT THE SCOPE OF THE STAF EXCLUSION FROM THE QUOTAS AND ALSO THE SPORTS FOOTWEAR EXCLUSIONS FROM THE TWO EU ANTI-DUMPING MEASURES. TO DATE, THE LARGE MAJORITY OF OUR FOOTWEAR MODELS FALL WITHIN THE EXCLUSIONS PROVIDED FOR UNDER THE CN. OUR

INNOVATIVE FOOTWEAR DESIGNS MAY STRETCH THE TRADITIONAL CONCEPTS OF ATHLETIC OR SPORTS FOOTWEAR REFLECTED IN THE TECHNICAL CRITERIA. WE ANTICIPATE THAT THE MAJORITY OF THESE NEW DESIGNS WILL FALL WITHIN THE EXCLUSIONS. NIKE IS AN ACTIVE PARTICIPANT

IN DISCUSSIONS TO REVISE THE TECHNICAL CRITERIA TO REFLECT TECHNOLOGICALLY ADVANCED DESIGNS.

ON MAY 1, 2004 10 NEW COUNTRIES WILL JOIN THE EU. THEY WILL ALSO JOIN THE EU SINGLE MARKET AND DISCUSSIONS ARE PRESENTLY UNDERWAY TO INCREASE THE CURRENT EU QUOTA SYSTEM TO ACCOUNT FOR THE ENLARGED EU MARKET. NIKE AND

OTHER MANUFACTURERS DO NOT EXPECT THIS EXPANSION OF THE EU SINGLE MARKET TO PRESENT ANY SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES TO THE IMPORTATION INTO THE EU OF SPORTS FOOTWEAR PRODUCED IN CHINA AS THE EU HAS ANNOUNCED THAT IT WILL INCREASE THE QUOTAS TO TAKE

ACCOUNT OF THE ENLARGED CONSUMER AND MARKET DEMAND.

IF THE EU

TRADE MEASURES BECOME SUBSTANTIALLY MORE RESTRICTIVE WE WOULD CONSIDER SHIFTING THE PRODUCTION OF OUR SPORTS FOOTWEAR TO OTHER COUNTRIES IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN COMPETITIVE PRICING AND ACCESS TO THESE MARKETS. WE BELIEVE THAT WE ARE PREPARED TO DEAL

EFFECTIVELY WITH ANY SUCH CHANGE OF CIRCUMSTANCES AND THAT ANY ADVERSE IMPACT WOULD BE OF A TEMPORARY NATURE. WE CONTINUE TO CLOSELY MONITOR INTERNATIONAL RESTRICTIONS AND MAINTAIN OUR MULTI-COUNTRY SOURCING STRATEGY AND CONTINGENCY PLANS. WE

BELIEVE THAT OUR MAJOR COMPETITORS STAND IN MUCH THE SAME POSITION REGARDING THESE TRADE MEASURES.

WE CURRENTLY SOURCE FOOTWEAR AND APPAREL PRODUCTS FROM FACTORIES IN VIETNAM. IN JULY 2000, THE UNITED STATES AND VIETNAM SIGNED A HISTORIC, COMPREHENSIVE

BILATERAL TRADE AGREEMENT, WHICH, AMONG OTHER THINGS, PROVIDES RECIPROCAL, NON-DISCRIMINATORY NORMAL TRADE RELATIONS (NTR) BETWEEN THE TWO COUNTRIES. IN SEPTEMBER 2001, THAT AGREEMENT WAS APPROVED BY CONGRESS AND THEN RATIFIED BY THE

VIETNAMESE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY. ONCE APPROVED, THE UNITED STATES GRANTED AN ANNUAL EXTENSION OF NTR TO VIETNAM. UNDER CURRENT U.S. LAW, THE PRESIDENT MUST RENEW THIS GRANT ANNUALLY WITH THE OPPORTUNITY FOR REVIEW BY CONGRESS. IN MAY 2003, PRESIDENT

BUSH RENEWED NTR FOR VIETNAM FOR AN ADDITIONAL YEAR AND WE ANTICIPATE CONGRESS WILL SUPPORT THIS DECISION. WE CURRENTLY BELIEVE THAT, ABSENT UNFORESEEN CIRCUMSTANCES, THE PRESIDENT WILL CONTINUE HIS ANNUAL EXTENSIONS OF NTR TO VIETNAM AND THAT

CONGRESS WILL SUPPORT THE PRESIDENTS DECISIONS. ONGOING NTR TRADING STATUS FOR VIETNAM WILL ALLOW US TO EXPAND OUR PRODUCTION AND MARKETING OPPORTUNITIES IN VIETNAM AND ALLOW FOR VIETNAMESE-SOURCED PRODUCT TO ENTER THE UNITED STATES AT NTR

TARIFF RATES.

COMPETITION

THE ATHLETIC

FOOTWEAR, APPAREL AND EQUIPMENT INDUSTRY IS KEENLY COMPETITIVE IN THE UNITED STATES AND ON A WORLDWIDE BASIS. WE COMPETE INTERNATIONALLY WITH AN INCREASING NUMBER OF ATHLETIC AND LEISURE SHOE COMPANIES, ATHLETIC AND LEISURE APPAREL COMPANIES, SPORTS

EQUIPMENT COMPANIES, AND LARGE COMPANIES HAVING DIVERSIFIED LINES OF ATHLETIC AND LEISURE SHOES, APPAREL AND EQUIPMENT, INCLUDING REEBOK, ADIDAS AND OTHERS. THE INTENSE COMPETITION AND THE RAPID CHANGES IN TECHNOLOGY AND CONSUMER PREFERENCES IN THE

MARKETS FOR ATHLETIC AND LEISURE FOOTWEAR AND APPAREL, AND ATHLETIC EQUIPMENT, CONSTITUTE SIGNIFICANT RISK FACTORS IN OUR OPERATIONS.

NIKE IS THE LARGEST SELLER OF ATHLETIC FOOTWEAR AND ATHLETIC APPAREL IN THE WORLD. PERFORMANCE AND RELIABILITY OF SHOES, APPAREL, AND EQUIPMENT, NEW

PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT, PRICE, PRODUCT IDENTITY THROUGH MARKETING AND PROMOTION, AND CUSTOMER SUPPORT AND SERVICE ARE IMPORTANT ASPECTS OF COMPETITION IN THE ATHLETIC FOOTWEAR, APPAREL AND EQUIPMENT INDUSTRY. TO HELP MARKET OUR PRODUCTS, WE CONTRACT

WITH PROMINENT AND INFLUENTIAL ATHLETES, COACHES, TEAMS, COLLEGES, AND SPORTS LEAGUES TO ENDORSE OUR BRANDS AND USE OUR PRODUCTS, AND WE ACTIVELY SPONSOR SPORTING EVENTS AND CLINICS. WE BELIEVE THAT WE ARE COMPETITIVE IN ALL OF THESE AREAS.

TRADEMARKS AND PATENTS

WE

UTILIZE TRADEMARKS ON NEARLY ALL OF OUR PRODUCTS AND BELIEVE THAT HAVING DISTINCTIVE MARKS THAT ARE READILY IDENTIFIABLE IS AN IMPORTANT FACTOR IN CREATING A MARKET FOR OUR GOODS, IN IDENTIFYING THE COMPANY, AND IN

TABLE OF CONTENTS

DISTINGUISHING OUR GOODS FROM THE GOODS OF OTHERS. WE CONSIDER OUR NIKE

®

AND SWOOSH DESIGN

®

TRADEMARKS TO BE AMONG OUR MOST VALUABLE ASSETS AND WE HAVE REGISTERED THESE TRADEMARKS IN OVER 100 COUNTRIES. IN ADDITION, WE OWN MANY OTHER

TRADEMARKS THAT WE UTILIZE IN MARKETING OUR PRODUCTS. WE CONTINUE TO VIGOROUSLY PROTECT OUR TRADEMARKS AGAINST INFRINGEMENT.

NIKE HAS AN EXCLUSIVE, WORLDWIDE LICENSE TO MAKE AND SELL FOOTWEAR USING PATENTED AIR TECHNOLOGY. THE PROCESS UTILIZES PRESSURIZED GAS

ENCAPSULATED IN POLYURETHANE. SOME OF THE EARLY NIKE AIR

®

PATENTS HAVE EXPIRED, WHICH MAY ENABLE COMPETITORS TO USE CERTAIN TYPES OF SIMILAR TECHNOLOGY. SUBSEQUENT NIKE AIR PATENTS WILL NOT EXPIRE FOR SEVERAL YEARS. WE ALSO HAVE A NUMBER OF PATENTS COVERING COMPONENTS AND

FEATURES USED IN VARIOUS ATHLETIC AND LEISURE SHOES. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR SUCCESS DEPENDS PRIMARILY UPON SKILLS IN DESIGN, RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, PRODUCTION AND MARKETING RATHER THAN UPON OUR PATENT POSITION. HOWEVER, WE HAVE FOLLOWED A POLICY OF

FILING APPLICATIONS FOR UNITED STATES AND FOREIGN PATENTS ON INVENTIONS, DESIGNS AND IMPROVEMENTS THAT WE DEEM VALUABLE.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

EXCEPT AS DESCRIBED BELOW, THERE ARE NO MATERIAL PENDING LEGAL PROCEEDINGS, OTHER THAN ORDINARY ROUTINE LITIGATION INCIDENTAL TO OUR BUSINESS, TO WHICH WE

ARE A PARTY OR OF WHICH ANY OF OUR PROPERTY IS THE SUBJECT.

THE COMPANY AND CERTAIN OF ITS OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS WERE NAMED AS DEFENDANTS IN FOUR SUBSTANTIALLY IDENTICAL SECURITIES CLASS ACTIONS FILED IN THE U.S. DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF OREGON ON MARCH 9, 14, 20, AND

10

TABLE OF CONTENTS

APRIL 4, 2001. ON JULY 23, 2001, THE CASES WERE CONSOLIDATED AS IN RE NIKE, INC. SECURITIES LITIGATION, CV-01-332-K. THE CONSOLIDATED AMENDED COMPLAINT

SOUGHT UNSPECIFIED DAMAGES ON BEHALF OF A PURPORTED CLASS CONSISTING OF PURCHASERS OF THE COMPANYS STOCK DURING THE PERIOD DECEMBER 20, 2000 THROUGH FEBRUARY 26, 2001. PLAINTIFFS ALLEGE THAT THE DEFENDANTS MADE FALSE AND MISLEADING STATEMENTS

ABOUT THE COMPANYS ACTUAL AND EXPECTED BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE IN VIOLATION OF FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS. PLAINTIFFS FURTHER ALLEGE THAT CERTAIN INDIVIDUAL DEFENDANTS SOLD COMPANY STOCK WHILE IN POSSESSION OF MATERIAL NON-PUBLIC

INFORMATION. IN JANUARY 2002, THE COURT DISMISSED THIS ACTION WITH LEAVE TO AMEND. ON FEBRUARY 25, 2002, PLAINTIFFS FILED AN AMENDED COMPLAINT EXTENDING THE PURPORTED CLASS PERIOD TO JUNE 29, 2000 THROUGH FEBRUARY 26, 2001 AND CONTAINING THE

ESSENTIAL ALLEGATIONS. ON OR ABOUT OCTOBER 18, 2002, THE COMPANY AND THE INDIVIDUAL DEFENDANTS REACHED AN AGREEMENT WITH THE PLAINTIFFS TO RESOLVE AND RELEASE ALL CLAIMS ASSERTED IN THE LITIGATION IN EXCHANGE FOR THE PAYMENT OF $8.9 MILLION, WHICH

WAS FUNDED BY THE COMPANYS DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS LIABILITY INSURERS. THE STIPULATION OF SETTLEMENT DATED AS OF OCTOBER 18, 2002 PROVIDED THAT THE COMPANY AND THE INDIVIDUAL DEFENDANTS DENIED ANY LIABILITY OR WRONGDOING, AND THE CLAIMS WERE

BEING SETTLED TO AVOID THE UNCERTAINTIES, BURDENS AND EXPENSE OF FURTHER LITIGATION. ON FEBRUARY 24, 2003, THE U.S. DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF OREGON ISSUED AN ORDER GRANTING FINAL APPROVAL OF THE SETTLEMENT AND ENTERED JUDGMENT DISMISSING

THE CASE WITH PREJUDICE.

ANOTHER RELATED SHAREHOLDER

DERIVATIVE LAWSUIT, METIVIER V. DENUNZIO, ET AL., 0104-04339, WAS FILED IN THE MULTNOMAH COUNTY CIRCUIT COURT OF THE STATE OF OREGON ON APRIL 26, 2001. THE STATE DERIVATIVE SUIT WAS BROUGHT BY A COMPANY SHAREHOLDER, ALLEGEDLY ON BEHALF OF THE

COMPANY, AGAINST CERTAIN DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS OF THE COMPANY. THE DERIVATIVE PLAINTIFF ALLEGES THAT THESE OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS BREACHED THEIR FIDUCIARY DUTIES TO THE COMPANY BY MAKING OR CAUSING TO BE MADE ALLEGED MISSTATEMENTS ABOUT THE

COMPANYS ACTUAL AND EXPECTED FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE WHILE CERTAIN OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS SOLD COMPANY STOCK AND BY ALLOWING THE COMPANY TO BE SUED IN THE SHAREHOLDER CLASS ACTION. THE DERIVATIVE PLAINTIFF SEEKS UNSPECIFIED DAMAGES AND

DISGORGEMENT OF PROFITS ON THE SALE OF COMPANY STOCK. ON JULY 25, 2001, THE COURT ENTERED A STIPULATION AND ORDER ABATING THE ACTION UNTIL FURTHER NOTICE. ON OR ABOUT FEBRUARY 11, 2003, THE PARTIES STIPULATED TO AN ORDER VACATING THE ORDER OF

ABATEMENT. ON FEBRUARY 14, 2003, THE DERIVATIVE PLAINTIFF FILED A FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT REITERATING AND EXPANDING UPON HIS ORIGINAL ALLEGATION, AND NAMING ADDITIONAL OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS AS DEFENDANTS. ON MARCH 31, 2003, THE COMPANY FILED A

MOTION TO DISMISS THE FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR FAILURE TO MAKE OR EXCUSE A DEMAND ON THE COMPANYS BOARD OF DIRECTORS. THE COMPANYS MOTION TO DISMISS WAS DENIED BY THE COURT ON JUNE 30, 2003. BASED ON THE AVAILABLE INFORMATION WE DO

NOT CURRENTLY ANTICIPATE THAT THE ACTION WILL HAVE A MATERIAL FINANCIAL IMPACT. WE BELIEVE THE CLAIMS ARE WITHOUT MERIT, AND WE INTEND TO VIGOROUSLY DEFEND AGAINST THEM.

ANOTHER RELATED SHAREHOLDER DERIVATIVE LAWSUIT, LENDMAN V. KNIGHT, ET AL., CV-01-1153-AS, WAS FILED IN THE U.S. DISTRICT

COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF OREGON ON JULY 26, 2001. THE FEDERAL DERIVATIVE COMPLAINT IS NOT MATERIALLY DIFFERENT FROM THE ORIGINAL COMPLAINT IN THE STATE DERIVATIVE ACTION. IT ALLEGES SUBSTANTIALLY SIMILAR CAUSES OF ACTION AND SEEKS SUBSTANTIALLY

SIMILAR REMEDIES. THE FEDERAL DERIVATIVE ACTION WAS SERVED ON THE COMPANY AND THE INDIVIDUAL DEFENDANTS ON DECEMBER 13, 2001 AND WAS ALSO STAYED PENDING THE OUTCOME OF IN RE NIKE, INC. SECURITIES LITIGATION ON DECEMBER 13, 2001. ON MAY 30, 2003, THE

COURT ENTERED AN ORDER OF ADMINISTRATIVE DISMISSAL DISMISSING THE CASE WITHOUT PREJUDICE.

IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE COMPANYS ARTICLES OF INCORPORATION AND BYLAWS, AND IN ACCORDANCE WITH INDEMNITY AGREEMENTS BETWEEN THE COMPANY AND THE DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS NAMED IN THE ABOVE LEGAL ACTIONS, THE COMPANY

HAS AGREED TO INDEMNIFY THESE INDIVIDUALS AND ASSUME THEIR DEFENSE IN THESE ACTIONS.

THE COMPANY AND CERTAIN OF ITS OFFICERS WERE NAMED AS DEFENDANTS IN A LAWSUIT, KASKY V. NIKE, INC. ET AL., NO. 994446, FILED IN 1998 IN SAN FRANCISCO COUNTY SUPERIOR COURT. PLAINTIFF BROUGHT THE ACTION UNDER THE

CALIFORNIA BUSINESS AND PROFESSIONS CODE ALLEGING THAT STATEMENTS MADE BY THE COMPANY IN RESPONSE TO CRITICISM ABOUT LABOR PRACTICES IN FACTORIES MAKING ITS PRODUCTS WERE FALSE OR MISLEADING. PLAINTIFF SEEKS INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND RESTITUTION OF

PROFITS EARNED FROM THE ALLEGED VIOLATIONS OF THE CALIFORNIA CODE. THE CLAIMS WERE DISMISSED BY THE SUPERIOR COURT, WITH THE COURT CONCLUDING THAT THE ALLEGED STATEMENTS, IF MADE, WERE PROTECTED SPEECH AS PART OF A PUBLIC DEBATE UNDER THE FIRST

AMENDMENT TO THE UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION. PLAINTIFF APPEALED THE SUPERIOR COURT RULING TO THE CALIFORNIA COURT OF APPEALS, WHICH COURT AFFIRMED THE RULING OF THE LOWER COURT. PLAINTIFF

11

TABLE OF CONTENTS

SOUGHT REVIEW IN THE CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT, WHICH, ON MAY 2, 2002, OVERTURNED THE LOWER COURT RULINGS BY A FOUR TO THREE VOTE. THE CALIFORNIA SUPREME

COURT MADE NO RULING ON THE MERITS OF PLAINTIFFS CONTENTION THAT THE COMPANY HAD MADE FALSE OR MISLEADING STATEMENTS, BUT CONCLUDED THAT THE ALLEGED STATEMENTS WERE COMMERCIAL SPEECH AND NOT ENTITLED TO THE FULL PROTECTION OF THE FIRST

AMENDMENT OF THE UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION. THE COMPANY FILED A PETITION FOR REHEARING BEFORE THE CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT, WHICH WAS DENIED ON JULY 31, 2002. THE COMPANY PETITIONED THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT FOR CERTIORARI, WHICH WAS GRANTED.

THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT RECENTLY DISMISSED OUR PETITION FOR REVIEW, CAUSING THE CASE TO RETURN TO THE CALIFORNIA SUPERIOR COURT. THE COURT STATED THAT FURTHER DEVELOPMENT OF THE CASE BEFORE REVIEW BY THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT WAS

NEEDED. WE EXPECT THAT THE CASE WILL NOW PROCEED THROUGH THE CALIFORNIA COURT SYSTEM WITH DISCOVERY, MOTIONS AND PERHAPS TRIAL IN THE SAME FASHION AS OTHER CASES PROCEED THROUGH THE COURTS. ORDINARY DISCOVERY AND MUCH MOTION PRACTICE HAVE NOT

OCCURRED IN THE TRIAL COURT. THE CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT NOTED THAT THE COMPANYS LEGAL CHALLENGES TO THE CASE OTHER THAN THE ONE IT RULED ON REMAIN OPEN FOR CONSIDERATION. BASED ON INFORMATION CURRENTLY AVAILABLE, WE DO NOT ANTICIPATE THAT

THE ACTION WILL HAVE A MATERIAL FINANCIAL IMPACT.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

OUR DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOLLOWING ARE BASED UPON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, WHICH

HAVE BEEN PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. THE PREPARATION OF THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS REQUIRES US TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS THAT AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS,

LIABILITIES, REVENUES AND EXPENSES, AND RELATED DISCLOSURE OF CONTINGENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES.

WE BELIEVE THAT THE ESTIMATES, ASSUMPTIONS AND JUDGMENTS INVOLVED IN THE ACCOUNTING POLICIES DESCRIBED BELOW HAVE THE GREATEST POTENTIAL IMPACT ON OUR

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, SO WE CONSIDER THESE TO BE OUR CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES. BECAUSE OF THE UNCERTAINTY INHERENT IN THESE MATTERS, ACTUAL RESULTS COULD DIFFER FROM THE ESTIMATES WE USE IN APPLYING THE CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES. CERTAIN OF

THESE CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AFFECT WORKING CAPITAL ACCOUNT BALANCES, INCLUDING THE POLICIES FOR REVENUE RECOGNITION, THE RESERVE FOR UNCOLLECTIBLE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, INVENTORY RESERVES, AND CONTINGENT PAYMENTS UNDER ENDORSEMENT CONTRACTS.

THESE POLICIES

15

TABLE OF CONTENTS

REQUIRE THAT WE MAKE ESTIMATES IN THE PREPARATION OF OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AS OF A GIVEN DATE. HOWEVER, SINCE OUR BUSINESS CYCLE IS RELATIVELY SHORT,

ACTUAL RESULTS RELATED TO THESE ESTIMATES ARE GENERALLY KNOWN WITHIN THE SIX-MONTH PERIOD FOLLOWING THE FINANCIAL STATEMENT DATE. THUS, THESE POLICIES GENERALLY AFFECT ONLY THE TIMING OF REPORTED AMOUNTS ACROSS TWO TO THREE QUARTERS.

WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF THESE CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES, WE ARE NOT

CURRENTLY AWARE OF ANY REASONABLY LIKELY EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES THAT WOULD RESULT IN MATERIALLY DIFFERENT AMOUNTS BEING REPORTED.

REVENUE RECOGNITION

WE RECORD WHOLESALE REVENUES WHEN TITLE PASSES AND THE RISKS AND REWARDS OF OWNERSHIP HAVE PASSED TO THE CUSTOMER, BASED ON THE TERMS OF SALE. TITLE

PASSES GENERALLY UPON SHIPMENT OR UPON RECEIPT BY THE CUSTOMER DEPENDING ON THE COUNTRY OF THE SALE AND THE AGREEMENT WITH THE CUSTOMER. RETAIL STORE REVENUES ARE RECORDED AT THE TIME OF SALE.

IN SOME INSTANCES, WE SHIP PRODUCT DIRECTLY FROM OUR SUPPLIER TO THE

CUSTOMER. IN THESE CASES, WE RECOGNIZE REVENUE WHEN THE PRODUCT IS DELIVERED TO AND ACCEPTED BY THE CUSTOMER. OUR REVENUES MAY FLUCTUATE IN CASES WHEN OUR CUSTOMERS DELAY ACCEPTING SHIPMENT OF PRODUCT FOR PERIODS UP TO SEVERAL WEEKS.

IN CERTAIN COUNTRIES OUTSIDE OF THE U.S., PRECISE INFORMATION REGARDING THE

DATE OF RECEIPT BY THE CUSTOMER IS NOT READILY AVAILABLE. IN THESE CASES, WE ESTIMATE THE DATE OF RECEIPT BY THE CUSTOMER BASED UPON HISTORICAL DELIVERY TIMES BY GEOGRAPHIC LOCATION. ON THE BASIS OF OUR TESTS OF ACTUAL TRANSACTIONS, WE HAVE NO

INDICATION THAT THESE ESTIMATES HAVE BEEN MATERIALLY INACCURATE HISTORICALLY.

AS PART OF OUR REVENUE RECOGNITION POLICY, WE RECORD ESTIMATED SALES RETURNS AND MISCELLANEOUS CLAIMS FROM CUSTOMERS AS REDUCTIONS TO REVENUES AT THE TIME REVENUES ARE RECORDED. WE BASE OUR ESTIMATES ON HISTORICAL

RATES OF PRODUCT RETURNS AND CLAIMS, AND SPECIFIC IDENTIFICATION OF OUTSTANDING CLAIMS AND OUTSTANDING RETURNS NOT YET RECEIVED FROM CUSTOMERS. ACTUAL RETURNS AND CLAIMS IN ANY FUTURE PERIOD ARE INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN AND THUS MAY DIFFER FROM OUR

ESTIMATES. IF ACTUAL OR EXPECTED FUTURE RETURNS AND CLAIMS WERE SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER OR LOWER THAN THE RESERVES WE HAD ESTABLISHED, WE WOULD RECORD A REDUCTION OR INCREASE TO NET REVENUES IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH WE MADE SUCH DETERMINATION.

RESERVE FOR UNCOLLECTIBLE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE

WE MAKE ONGOING ESTIMATES RELATING TO THE COLLECTIBILITY OF OUR ACCOUNTS

RECEIVABLE AND MAINTAIN A RESERVE FOR ESTIMATED LOSSES RESULTING FROM THE INABILITY OF OUR CUSTOMERS TO MAKE REQUIRED PAYMENTS. IN DETERMINING THE AMOUNT OF THE RESERVE, WE CONSIDER OUR HISTORICAL LEVEL OF CREDIT LOSSES AND MAKE JUDGMENTS ABOUT THE

CREDITWORTHINESS OF SIGNIFICANT CUSTOMERS BASED ON ONGOING CREDIT EVALUATIONS. SINCE WE CANNOT PREDICT FUTURE CHANGES IN THE FINANCIAL STABILITY OF OUR CUSTOMERS, ACTUAL FUTURE LOSSES FROM UNCOLLECTIBLE ACCOUNTS MAY DIFFER FROM OUR ESTIMATES. IF THE

FINANCIAL CONDITION OF OUR CUSTOMERS WERE TO DETERIORATE, RESULTING IN THEIR INABILITY TO MAKE PAYMENTS, A LARGER RESERVE MIGHT BE REQUIRED. IN THE EVENT WE DETERMINED THAT A SMALLER OR LARGER RESERVE WAS APPROPRIATE, WE WOULD RECORD A CREDIT OR A

CHARGE TO SELLING AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH WE MADE SUCH A DETERMINATION.

INVENTORY RESERVES

WE

ALSO MAKE ONGOING ESTIMATES RELATING TO THE NET REALIZABLE VALUE OF INVENTORIES, BASED UPON OUR ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT FUTURE DEMAND AND MARKET CONDITIONS. IF WE ESTIMATE THAT THE NET REALIZABLE VALUE OF OUR INVENTORY IS LESS THAN THE COST OF THE

INVENTORY RECORDED ON OUR BOOKS, WE RECORD A RESERVE EQUAL TO THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE COST OF THE INVENTORY AND THE ESTIMATED NET REALIZABLE VALUE. THIS RESERVE IS RECORDED AS A CHARGE TO COST OF SALES. IF CHANGES IN MARKET CONDITIONS RESULT IN

REDUCTIONS IN THE ESTIMATED NET REALIZABLE VALUE OF OUR INVENTORY BELOW OUR PREVIOUS ESTIMATE, WE WOULD INCREASE OUR RESERVE IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH WE MADE SUCH A DETERMINATION AND RECORD A CHARGE TO COST OF SALES.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

CONTINGENT PAYMENTS UNDER ENDORSEMENT CONTRACTS

A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR DEMAND CREATION (ADVERTISING AND PROMOTION) EXPENSE RELATES TO PAYMENTS UNDER ENDORSEMENT

CONTRACTS. IN GENERAL, ENDORSEMENT PAYMENTS ARE EXPENSED UNIFORMLY OVER THE TERM OF THE CONTRACT. HOWEVER, CERTAIN CONTRACT ELEMENTS MAY BE ACCOUNTED FOR DIFFERENTLY, BASED UPON THE FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES OF EACH INDIVIDUAL CONTRACT.

CERTAIN CONTRACTS PROVIDE FOR CONTINGENT PAYMENTS TO ENDORSERS BASED UPON

SPECIFIC ACHIEVEMENTS IN THEIR SPORTS (E.G., WINNING A CHAMPIONSHIP). WE RECORD SELLING AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE FOR THESE AMOUNTS WHEN THE ENDORSER ACHIEVES THE SPECIFIC GOAL.

CERTAIN CONTRACTS PROVIDE FOR PAYMENTS BASED UPON ENDORSERS MAINTAINING A LEVEL OF PERFORMANCE IN THEIR SPORT OVER AN

EXTENDED PERIOD OF TIME (E.G., MAINTAINING A TOP RANKING IN A SPORT FOR A YEAR). THESE AMOUNTS ARE REPORTED IN SELLING AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE WHEN WE DETERMINE THAT IT IS PROBABLE THAT THE SPECIFIED LEVEL OF PERFORMANCE WILL BE MAINTAINED

THROUGHOUT THE PERIOD. IN THESE INSTANCES, TO THE EXTENT THAT ACTUAL PAYMENTS TO THE ENDORSER DIFFER FROM OUR ESTIMATE DUE TO CHANGES IN THE ENDORSERS ATHLETIC PERFORMANCE, INCREASED OR DECREASED SELLING AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE MAY BE

REPORTED IN A FUTURE PERIOD.

CERTAIN CONTRACTS PROVIDE FOR

ROYALTY PAYMENTS TO ENDORSERS BASED UPON A PREDETERMINED PERCENTAGE OF SALES OF PARTICULAR PRODUCTS. WE EXPENSE THESE PAYMENTS IN COST OF SALES AS THE RELATED SALES ARE MADE. IN CERTAIN CONTRACTS, WE OFFER MINIMUM GUARANTEED ROYALTY PAYMENTS. FOR

CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS FOR WHICH WE ESTIMATE THAT WE WILL NOT MEET THE MINIMUM GUARANTEED AMOUNT OF ROYALTY FEES THROUGH SALES OF PRODUCT, WE RECORD THE AMOUNT OF THE GUARANTEED PAYMENT IN EXCESS OF THAT EARNED THROUGH SALES OF PRODUCT IN SELLING

AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE UNIFORMLY OVER THE REMAINING GUARANTEE PERIOD.

PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT

PROPERTY, PLANT

AND EQUIPMENT, INCLUDING BUILDINGS, EQUIPMENT, AND COMPUTER HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE IS RECORDED AT COST (INCLUDING, IN SOME CASES, THE COST OF INTERNAL LABOR) AND IS DEPRECIATED OVER ITS ESTIMATED USEFUL LIFE. CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES (SUCH AS

TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES OR CHANGES TO OUR BUSINESS OPERATIONS) CAN RESULT IN DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE ACTUAL AND ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES. IN THOSE CASES WHERE WE DETERMINE THAT THE USEFUL LIFE OF A LONG-LIVED ASSET SHOULD BE SHORTENED, WE INCREASE

DEPRECIATION EXPENSE OVER THE REMAINING USEFUL LIFE TO DEPRECIATE THE ASSETS NET BOOK VALUE TO ITS SALVAGE VALUE.

WHEN EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THAT THE CARRYING VALUE OF PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT MAY BE IMPAIRED, WE ESTIMATE THE FUTURE UNDISCOUNTED CASH

FLOWS TO BE DERIVED FROM THE ASSET TO DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT A POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT EXISTS. IF THE CARRYING VALUE EXCEEDS OUR ESTIMATE OF FUTURE UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS, WE THEN CALCULATE THE IMPAIRMENT AS THE EXCESS OF THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE

ASSET OVER OUR ESTIMATE OF ITS FAIR MARKET VALUE. ANY IMPAIRMENT CHARGES ARE RECORDED AS OTHER EXPENSE. WE ESTIMATE FUTURE UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS USING ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT OUR EXPECTED FUTURE OPERATING PERFORMANCE. OUR ESTIMATES OF UNDISCOUNTED CASH

FLOWS MAY CHANGE IN FUTURE PERIODS DUE TO, AMONG OTHER THINGS, TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGES, ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, CHANGES TO OUR BUSINESS OPERATIONS OR INABILITY TO MEET BUSINESS PLANS. SUCH CHANGES MAY RESULT IN IMPAIRMENT CHARGES IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH

SUCH CHANGES IN ESTIMATES ARE MADE.

GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS

WE ADOPTED STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

(SFAS) NO. 142, GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS, (FAS 142) EFFECTIVE FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2003. IN ACCORDANCE WITH FAS 142, GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS WITH INDEFINITE LIVES ARE NO LONGER AMORTIZED BUT INSTEAD MEASURED

FOR IMPAIRMENT AT LEAST ANNUALLY OR WHEN EVENTS INDICATE THAT AN IMPAIRMENT EXISTS. AS REQUIRED BY FAS 142, IN OUR IMPAIRMENT TESTS FOR GOODWILL AND OTHER INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS, WE COMPARE THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF GOODWILL AND OTHER

INTANGIBLE ASSETS TO THE CARRYING VALUE. IF THE CARRYING VALUE EXCEEDS OUR ESTIMATE OF FAIR VALUE, WE CALCULATE IMPAIRMENT AS THE EXCESS OF THE CARRYING VALUE OVER OUR ESTIMATE OF FAIR VALUE. OUR ESTIMATES OF FAIR VALUE UTILIZED

17

TABLE OF CONTENTS

IN GOODWILL AND OTHER INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSET TESTS MAY BE BASED UPON A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING OUR ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT THE EXPECTED FUTURE

OPERATING PERFORMANCE OF OUR REPORTING UNITS. OUR ESTIMATES MAY CHANGE IN FUTURE PERIODS DUE TO, AMONG OTHER THINGS, TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE, ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, CHANGES TO OUR BUSINESS OPERATIONS OR INABILITY TO MEET BUSINESS PLANS. SUCH CHANGES MAY

RESULT IN IMPAIRMENT CHARGES RECORDED IN FUTURE PERIODS.

AS

DISCUSSED FURTHER BELOW, UPON ADOPTION OF FAS 142, WE RECORDED AN IMPAIRMENT CHARGE RELATED TO GOODWILL AND OTHER INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS OF $266.1 MILLION. THIS CHARGE IS SHOWN ON OUR CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF INCOME AS THE CUMULATIVE

EFFECT OF ACCOUNTING CHANGE. IN FUTURE PERIODS, ANY GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT CHARGES WOULD BE CLASSIFIED AS A SEPARATE LINE ITEM ON OUR CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF INCOME AS PART OF INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES AND CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF ACCOUNTING CHANGE.

OTHER INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSET IMPAIRMENT CHARGES WOULD BE CLASSIFIED AS OTHER EXPENSE.

INTANGIBLE ASSETS THAT ARE DETERMINED TO HAVE DEFINITE LIVES WILL CONTINUE TO BE AMORTIZED OVER THEIR USEFUL LIVES AND ARE MEASURED FOR IMPAIRMENT ONLY

WHEN EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THE CARRYING VALUE MAY BE IMPAIRED. IN THESE CASES, WE ESTIMATE THE FUTURE UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS TO BE DERIVED FROM THE ASSET TO DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT A POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT EXISTS. IF THE CARRYING VALUE

EXCEEDS OUR ESTIMATE OF FUTURE UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS, WE THEN CALCULATE THE IMPAIRMENT AS THE EXCESS OF THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE ASSET OVER OUR ESTIMATE OF ITS FAIR VALUE. ANY IMPAIRMENT CHARGES WOULD BE CLASSIFIED AS OTHER EXPENSE.

HEDGE ACCOUNTING FOR DERIVATIVES

WE USE FORWARD EXCHANGE CONTRACTS AND OPTION CONTRACTS TO HEDGE CERTAIN

ANTICIPATED FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE TRANSACTIONS, AS WELL AS ANY RESULTING RECEIVABLE OR PAYABLE BALANCE. WHEN SPECIFIC CRITERIA REQUIRED BY SFAS NO. 133, ACCOUNTING FOR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES, HAVE BEEN MET,

CHANGES IN FAIR VALUES OF HEDGE CONTRACTS RELATING TO ANTICIPATED TRANSACTIONS ARE RECORDED IN OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME RATHER THAN NET INCOME UNTIL THE UNDERLYING HEDGED TRANSACTION AFFECTS NET INCOME. IN MOST CASES, THIS RESULTS IN GAINS AND

LOSSES ON HEDGE DERIVATIVES BEING RELEASED FROM OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME INTO NET INCOME SOME TIME AFTER THE MATURITY OF THE DERIVATIVE. ONE OF THE CRITERIA FOR THIS ACCOUNTING TREATMENT IS THAT THE FORWARD EXCHANGE CONTRACT AMOUNT SHOULD NOT BE

IN EXCESS OF SPECIFICALLY IDENTIFIED ANTICIPATED TRANSACTIONS. BY THEIR VERY NATURE, OUR ESTIMATES OF ANTICIPATED TRANSACTIONS MAY FLUCTUATE OVER TIME AND MAY ULTIMATELY VARY FROM ACTUAL TRANSACTIONS. WHEN ANTICIPATED TRANSACTION ESTIMATES OR ACTUAL

TRANSACTION AMOUNTS DECREASE BELOW HEDGED LEVELS, OR WHEN THE TIMING OF TRANSACTIONS CHANGES SIGNIFICANTLY, WE ARE REQUIRED TO RECLASSIFY AT LEAST A PORTION OF THE CUMULATIVE CHANGES IN FAIR VALUES OF THE RELATED HEDGE CONTRACTS FROM OTHER

COMPREHENSIVE INCOME TO OTHER INCOME/EXPENSE DURING THE QUARTER IN WHICH SUCH CHANGES OCCUR. ONCE AN ANTICIPATED TRANSACTION ESTIMATE OR ACTUAL TRANSACTION AMOUNT DECREASES BELOW HEDGED LEVELS, WE MAKE ADJUSTMENTS TO THE RELATED HEDGE CONTRACT IN

ORDER TO REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF THE HEDGE CONTRACT TO THAT OF THE REVISED ANTICIPATED TRANSACTION.

TAXES

WE RECORD

VALUATION ALLOWANCES AGAINST OUR DEFERRED TAX ASSETS, WHEN NECESSARY, IN ACCORDANCE WITH SFAS NO. 109, ACCOUNTING FOR INCOME TAXES. REALIZATION OF DEFERRED TAX ASSETS (SUCH AS NET OPERATING LOSS CARRYFORWARDS) IS DEPENDENT ON FUTURE

TAXABLE EARNINGS AND IS THEREFORE UNCERTAIN. AT LEAST QUARTERLY, WE ASSESS THE LIKELIHOOD THAT OUR DEFERRED TAX ASSET BALANCE WILL BE RECOVERED FROM FUTURE TAXABLE INCOME. TO THE EXTENT WE BELIEVE THAT RECOVERY IS NOT LIKELY, WE ESTABLISH A

VALUATION ALLOWANCE AGAINST OUR DEFERRED TAX ASSET, INCREASING OUR INCOME TAX EXPENSE IN THE YEAR SUCH DETERMINATION IS MADE.

IN ADDITION, WE HAVE NOT RECORDED U.S. INCOME TAX EXPENSE FOR FOREIGN EARNINGS THAT WE HAVE DECLARED AS INDEFINITELY REINVESTED OFFSHORE, THUS REDUCING

OUR OVERALL INCOME TAX EXPENSE. THE AMOUNT OF EARNINGS DESIGNATED AS INDEFINITELY REINVESTED OFFSHORE IS BASED UPON THE ACTUAL DEPLOYMENT OF SUCH EARNINGS IN OUR OFFSHORE ASSETS AND OUR EXPECTATIONS OF THE FUTURE CASH NEEDS OF OUR U.S. AND FOREIGN

ENTITIES. INCOME TAX CONSIDERATIONS ARE ALSO A FACTOR IN DETERMINING THE AMOUNT OF FOREIGN EARNINGS TO BE INDEFINITELY  REINVESTED OFFSHORE.

18

TABLE OF CONTENTS

WE TAKE A CONSERVATIVE APPROACH IN DETERMINING THE AMOUNT OF FOREIGN EARNINGS TO DECLARE AS REINVESTED

OFFSHORE. AS REQUIRED BY U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES, THE PRESUMPTION IS THAT SUCH EARNINGS WILL BE REPATRIATED IN THE FUTURE. WE CAREFULLY REVIEW ALL FACTORS THAT DRIVE THE ULTIMATE DISPOSITION OF SUCH FOREIGN EARNINGS, AND APPLY

STRINGENT STANDARDS TO OVERCOMING THE PRESUMPTION OF REPATRIATION. DESPITE THIS CONSERVATIVE APPROACH, BECAUSE THE DETERMINATION INVOLVES OUR FUTURE PLANS AND EXPECTATIONS OF FUTURE EVENTS, THE POSSIBILITY EXISTS THAT AMOUNTS DECLARED AS

INDEFINITELY REINVESTED OFFSHORE MAY ULTIMATELY BE REPATRIATED. FOR INSTANCE, THE ACTUAL CASH NEEDS OF OUR U.S. ENTITIES MAY EXCEED OUR CURRENT EXPECTATIONS, OR THE ACTUAL CASH NEEDS OF OUR FOREIGN ENTITIES MAY BE LESS THAN OUR CURRENT EXPECTATIONS.

THIS WOULD RESULT IN ADDITIONAL INCOME TAX EXPENSE IN THE YEAR WE DETERMINED THAT AMOUNTS WERE NO LONGER INDEFINITELY REINVESTED OFFSHORE. CONVERSELY, OUR CONSERVATIVE APPROACH MAY RESULT IN ACCUMULATED FOREIGN EARNINGS (FOR WHICH U.S. INCOME TAXES

HAVE BEEN PROVIDED) BEING DETERMINED IN THE FUTURE TO BE INDEFINITELY REINVESTED OFFSHORE. IN THIS CASE, OUR INCOME TAX EXPENSE WOULD BE REDUCED IN THE YEAR OF SUCH DETERMINATION.

ON AN INTERIM BASIS, WE ESTIMATE WHAT OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE WILL BE FOR THE FULL FISCAL YEAR AND RECORD A QUARTERLY INCOME

TAX PROVISION IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE ANTICIPATED ANNUAL RATE. AS THE FISCAL YEAR PROGRESSES, WE CONTINUALLY REFINE OUR ESTIMATE BASED UPON ACTUAL EVENTS AND EARNINGS BY JURISDICTION DURING THE YEAR. THIS CONTINUAL ESTIMATION PROCESS PERIODICALLY

RESULTS IN A CHANGE TO OUR EXPECTED EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR THE FISCAL YEAR. WHEN THIS OCCURS, WE ADJUST THE INCOME TAX PROVISION DURING THE QUARTER IN WHICH THE CHANGE IN ESTIMATE OCCURS SO THAT THE YEAR-TO-DATE PROVISION EQUALS THE EXPECTED ANNUAL

RATE.

OTHER CONTINGENCIES

IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS, WE ARE INVOLVED IN LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

REGARDING CONTRACTUAL AND EMPLOYMENT RELATIONSHIPS, PRODUCT LIABILITY CLAIMS, TRADEMARK RIGHTS, AND A VARIETY OF OTHER MATTERS. WE RECORD CONTINGENT LIABILITIES RESULTING FROM CLAIMS AGAINST US WHEN IT IS PROBABLE THAT A LIABILITY HAS BEEN INCURRED

AND THE AMOUNT OF THE LOSS IS REASONABLY ESTIMABLE. WE DISCLOSE CONTINGENT LIABILITIES WHEN THERE IS A REASONABLE POSSIBILITY THAT THE ULTIMATE LOSS WILL MATERIALLY EXCEED THE RECORDED LIABILITY. ESTIMATING PROBABLE LOSSES REQUIRES ANALYSIS OF

MULTIPLE FACTORS, IN SOME CASES INCLUDING JUDGMENTS ABOUT THE POTENTIAL ACTIONS OF THIRD PARTY CLAIMANTS AND COURTS. THEREFORE, ACTUAL LOSSES IN ANY FUTURE PERIOD ARE INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN. CURRENTLY, WE DO NOT BELIEVE THAT ANY OF OUR PENDING LEGAL

PROCEEDINGS OR CLAIMS WILL HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR FINANCIAL POSITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. HOWEVER, IF ACTUAL OR ESTIMATED PROBABLE FUTURE LOSSES EXCEED OUR RECORDED LIABILITY FOR SUCH CLAIMS, WE WOULD RECORD ADDITIONAL CHARGES AS OTHER

EXPENSE DURING THE PERIOD IN WHICH THE ACTUAL LOSS OR CHANGE IN ESTIMATE OCCURRED.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

FISCAL 2003 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2002



REVENUES INCREASED 8% TO $10.7 BILLION, THE HIGHEST ANNUAL REVENUES IN THE HISTORY OF NIKE.



INCOME BEFORE THE CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF AN ACCOUNTING CHANGE INCREASED TO $740.1 MILLION FROM $668.3 MILLION IN THE PRIOR YEAR, AN INCREASE OF 11%. AFTER THE EFFECT OF THE

ACCOUNTING CHANGE, NET INCOME DECLINED 29% FROM $663.3 MILLION TO $474.0 MILLION.



DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE BEFORE THE EFFECT OF THE ACCOUNTING CHANGE INCREASED BY 13%, FROM $2.46 TO $2.77. AFTER THE EFFECT OF THE ACCOUNTING CHANGE, DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE

DECLINED 27%.



GROSS MARGINS INCREASED AS A PERCENTAGE OF REVENUES FROM 39.3% TO 41.0% IN FISCAL 2003.



SELLING AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE INCREASED AS A PERCENTAGE OF REVENUES TO 29.3% FROM 28.5% IN THE PRIOR YEAR.

REVENUE GROWTH IN OUR INTERNATIONAL REGIONS DROVE THE 8% INCREASE IN

CONSOLIDATED REVENUES IN FISCAL 2003 AS COMPARED TO FISCAL 2002. CHANGES IN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES, PRIMARILY THE EURO, WERE RESPONSIBLE FOR 4% OF THE CONSOLIDATED REVENUE GROWTH.

19

TABLE OF CONTENTS

OUR LARGEST INTERNATIONAL REGION, EUROPE, MIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA (EMEA), REPORTED 20% REVENUE GROWTH IN

FISCAL 2003 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2002. THIS GROWTH REFLECTED A 15 PERCENTAGE POINT IMPROVEMENT DUE TO CHANGES IN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES. GROWTH IN THE EMERGING MARKETS IN CENTRAL AND EASTERN EUROPE WAS THE KEY DRIVER OF THE BALANCE OF THE INCREASE,

AS OUR DISTRIBUTION CONTINUED TO EXPAND IN THESE MARKETS AND CUSTOMER DEMAND INCREASED. EXCLUDING THE EFFECT FROM CHANGES IN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES, EACH OF OUR EMEA BUSINESS UNITS, FOOTWEAR, APPAREL, AND EQUIPMENT, DELIVERED REVENUE GROWTH VERSUS

THE PRIOR YEAR.

EMEA PRE-TAX INCOME GREW FROM $422.4 MILLION

IN FISCAL 2002 TO $533.0 MILLION IN FISCAL 2003. HIGHER REVENUES AND IMPROVED GROSS MARGINS DROVE THE INCREASE, MORE THAN OFFSETTING INCREMENTAL SELLING AND ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS.

IN ASIA PACIFIC, REVENUES INCREASED 19% IN FISCAL 2003; FIVE PERCENTAGE POINTS OF THIS GROWTH WERE DUE TO CHANGES IN

CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES. EXCLUDING THE BENEFIT FROM CHANGES IN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES, SALES IN EACH ASIA PACIFIC BUSINESS UNIT GREW IN FISCAL 2003, AS DID SALES IN ALMOST EVERY COUNTRY OF THE REGION, PARTICULARLY JAPAN AND KOREA, DRIVEN PRIMARILY

BY HEIGHTENED CONSUMER DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS FOLLOWING THE 2002 WORLD CUP AND OUR RELATED MARKETING CAMPAIGN, AND CHINA, DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY AN EXPANSION OF RETAIL DISTRIBUTION OF OUR PRODUCTS.

PRE-TAX INCOME FOR THE ASIA PACIFIC REGION INCREASED FROM $216.2 MILLION IN

FISCAL 2002 TO $295.0 MILLION IN FISCAL 2003. THIS INCREASE REFLECTED HIGHER REVENUES AND IMPROVED GROSS MARGINS THAT MORE THAN OFFSET HIGHER SELLING AND ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS.

IN THE AMERICAS REGION, FISCAL 2003 REVENUES DECREASED 7% COMPARED TO FISCAL 2002, REFLECTING HIGHER SALES IN LOCAL

CURRENCIES THAT WERE MORE THAN OFFSET BY A 15 PERCENTAGE POINT DECLINE DUE TO CHANGES IN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES. THIS CURRENCY EXCHANGE IMPACT WAS DUE TO WEAKER CURRENCIES IN THE LATIN AMERICAN MARKETS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE STRONGER CANADIAN

DOLLAR. EXCLUDING THE CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE IMPACT, THE REGION EXPERIENCED SALES GROWTH IN THE FOOTWEAR AND EQUIPMENT BUSINESS UNITS SLIGHTLY OFFSET BY A SMALL PERCENTAGE DECREASE IN THE APPAREL BUSINESS UNIT. ON A GEOGRAPHIC BASIS, EXCLUDING

CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE IMPACTS, THE REGION EXPERIENCED SALES GROWTH IN BRAZIL, ARGENTINA, AND MEXICO, REFLECTING STRONGER CONSUMER DEMAND. THE SALES GROWTH IN ARGENTINA REFLECTED A REBOUND SINCE FISCAL 2002 WHEN THAT COUNTRY UNDERWENT AN ECONOMIC

CRISIS.

PRE-TAX INCOME FOR THE AMERICAS REGION GREW FROM $92.1

MILLION IN FISCAL 2002 TO $96.3 MILLION IN FISCAL 2003. PRE-TAX INCOME IMPROVED DESPITE LOWER REPORTED REVENUES PRIMARILY DUE TO AN IMPROVED GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE.

IN THE U.S. REGION, REVENUES WERE DOWN SLIGHTLY IN FISCAL 2003, AT $4,658.4 MILLION VERSUS $4,669.6 MILLION IN FISCAL 2002.

U.S. FOOTWEAR REVENUES WERE DOWN 4%, MORE THAN OFFSETTING SALES GROWTH IN U.S. APPAREL AND EQUIPMENT. U.S. APPAREL SALES INCREASED $95.3 MILLION DOLLARS, PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY INCREASED CONSUMER DEMAND FOR TEAM LICENSED APPAREL. LOWER REVENUES IN THE

FOOTWEAR BUSINESS UNIT WERE LARGELY THE RESULT OF A SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN OUR U.S. FOOTWEAR DISTRIBUTION.

DURING FISCAL 2003, WE BEGAN A REALIGNMENT OF OUR U.S. FOOTWEAR DISTRIBUTION TO ADDRESS THE CHANGING RETAIL MARKETPLACE, INCLUDING OUR LARGEST

CUSTOMERS (FOOT LOCKER) REDUCTION IN EMPHASIS ON PREMIUM FOOTWEAR IN ITS OFFERINGS. THE OBJECTIVES OF THIS REALIGNMENT ARE TO IMPROVE THE PRESENTATION AND PROFITABILITY OF THE NIKE BRAND IN THE U.S. AS A RESULT OF CHANGES IN BOTH FOOT

LOCKERS ORDERS AND OUR PRODUCT OFFERINGS TO THIS ACCOUNT, OUR FISCAL 2003 SALES TO FOOT LOCKER IN THE U.S. WERE SIGNIFICANTLY BELOW THE LEVEL OF FISCAL 2002. AT THE SAME TIME, WE EXPANDED THE PREMIUM PRODUCTS AVAILABLE TO OTHER ATHLETIC

SPECIALTY AND INDEPENDENT RETAILERS THAT FOCUS ON PREMIUM FOOTWEAR OFFERINGS, INCREASING SALES TO THESE ACCOUNTS SIGNIFICANTLY.

BASED UPON U.S. FUTURES ORDERS SCHEDULED FOR DELIVERY THROUGH DECEMBER 2003, WE EXPECT THAT U.S. FOOTWEAR REVENUES WILL REMAIN BELOW PRIOR YEAR LEVELS AT

LEAST THROUGH THE FIRST HALF OF FISCAL 2004. IN THE SHORT

20

TABLE OF CONTENTS

TERM, WE DO NOT EXPECT TO FULLY OFFSET THE REVENUE DECLINE FROM FOOT LOCKER IN THE U.S., AND THE AMOUNTS OF FUTURE SALES TO FOOT LOCKER ARE UNCERTAIN.

HOWEVER, WE BELIEVE THE NIKE BRAND CONTINUES TO ENJOY STRONG CONSUMER DEMAND AND THAT WE WILL SUCCESSFULLY REALIGN OUR DISTRIBUTION TO FULFILL CONSUMERS DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS AND GENERATE PROFITABLE REVENUE GROWTH.

OUR UNIT SALES OF FOOTWEAR IN THE U.S. INCREASED SLIGHTLY AS COMPARED TO

FISCAL 2002. HOWEVER, THIS VOLUME INCREASE WAS MORE THAN OFFSET BY A DECLINE IN THE AVERAGE PRICE PER PAIR OF FOOTWEAR SOLD. THE REDUCTION IN AVERAGE PRICE PER PAIR IN FISCAL 2003 VERSUS FISCAL 2002 REFLECTED A HIGHER PERCENTAGE OF SALES OF CLASSIC

FOOTWEAR AND KIDS MODELS, WHICH HAVE A LOWER AVERAGE PRICE THAN OUR MORE COMPLEX ADULT PERFORMANCE MODELS. BASED UPON FUTURES ORDERS, AVERAGE PRICE PER PAIR ORDERED BY CUSTOMERS FOR DELIVERY IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2004 WAS SLIGHTLY

BELOW THE PRIOR YEAR, BUT THE AVERAGE PRICE PER PAIR INCREASED FOR SECOND QUARTER ORDERS.

U.S. REGION PRE-TAX INCOME INCREASED FROM $956.0 MILLION IN FISCAL 2002 TO $957.5 MILLION IN FISCAL 2003. PRE-TAX INCOME IMPROVED, DESPITE LOWER REVENUES AND HIGHER SELLING AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE, DUE TO IMPROVED

GROSS MARGINS.

OTHER REVENUES INCLUDE REVENUES FROM BAUER NIKE

HOCKEY, INC., COLE HAAN HOLDINGS, INC., HURLEY INTERNATIONAL LLC, AND NIKE GOLF. IN FISCAL 2003, WE BEGAN MANAGING THE NIKE GOLF OPERATIONS IN OUR LARGEST GOLF MARKETS SEPARATELY FROM OUR REGIONAL BUSINESSES. AS A RESULT, BEGINNING IN THE FIRST

QUARTER OF FISCAL 2003, REVENUES AND PRE-TAX INCOME FOR THESE BUSINESSES HAVE BEEN EXCLUDED FROM THE REGIONAL RESULTS AND REPORTED IN THE OTHER CATEGORY. THIS NIKE GOLF INFORMATION FOR FISCAL 2002 AND FISCAL 2001 HAS BEEN RECLASSIFIED IN THIS

FORM 10-K TO CONFORM TO THE FISCAL 2003 PRESENTATION.

OTHER REVENUES GREW 12% IN FISCAL 2003 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2002. THE ADDITION OF REVENUES FROM OUR HURLEY BUSINESS, PURCHASED IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF FISCAL 2002, DROVE THE INCREASE IN OTHER REVENUES.

OTHER PRE-TAX INCOME DECLINED FROM $56.8 MILLION IN FISCAL 2002 TO $18.9

MILLION IN FISCAL 2003. REDUCED PROFITABILITY AT NIKE GOLF DROVE THIS DECLINE, REFLECTING SIGNIFICANTLY WEAKER DEMAND IN THE U.S. GOLF MARKET VERSUS FISCAL 2002 AND START-UP ISSUES WE EXPERIENCED AT A THIRD-PARTY DISTRIBUTION FACILITY. WE EXPECT

THAT DEMAND IN THE U.S. FOR GOLF PRODUCTS THROUGHOUT THE INDUSTRY AND FOR OUR BUSINESS MAY REMAIN WEAK IN THE NEAR TERM DUE TO THE CURRENT SLOWDOWN OF THE U.S. ECONOMY.

THIS DISCUSSION

INCLUDES DISCLOSURE OF PRE-TAX INCOME FOR OUR OPERATING SEGMENTS. WE HAVE REPORTED PRE-TAX INCOME FOR EACH OF OUR OPERATING SEGMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARD NO. 131, DISCLOSURES ABOUT SEGMENTS

WORLDWIDE FUTURES

AND ADVANCE ORDERS FOR OUR FOOTWEAR AND APPAREL SCHEDULED FOR DELIVERY FROM JUNE 2003 TO NOVEMBER 2003 WERE 5.0% HIGHER THAN SUCH ORDERS REPORTED IN THE COMPARABLE PERIOD OF FISCAL 2002. FIVE POINTS OF THIS REPORTED INCREASE WERE DUE TO CHANGES IN

CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES VERSUS THE SAME PERIOD LAST YEAR. ON OUR JUNE 26, 2003 PRESS RELEASE, WE REPORTED THAT WORLDWIDE FUTURES AND ADVANCE ORDERS FOR THIS PERIOD WERE UP 4.4% AS COMPARED TO LAST YEAR AND THAT FUTURES AND ADVANCE ORDERS IN THE U.S.

WERE DOWN 10% AS COMPARED TO LAST YEAR. OUR FUTURES PROGRAM PERMITS CHANGES TO ORDERS FOR A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME FOLLOWING THE ORDER DEADLINE. SUCH CHANGES TO U.S. ORDERS, MOST NOTABLY ADDITIONAL ORDERS OF FOOTWEAR FROM FOOT LOCKER, INCREASED THE

GROWTH IN WORLDWIDE FUTURES FOR THE JUNE TO NOVEMBER PERIOD BY 0.6 PERCENTAGE POINTS, TO 5.0%, AND REDUCED THE DECREASE IN U.S. ORDERS FROM 10% TO 9%. THESE ORDERS WERE FOR FOOTWEAR CONSISTENT WITH OUR DISTRIBUTION REALIGNMENT STRATEGY DISCUSSED

ABOVE. THE REPORTED FUTURES ORDERS GROWTH IS NOT NECESSARILY INDICATIVE OF OUR EXPECTATION OF REVENUE GROWTH DURING THIS PERIOD. THIS IS BECAUSE THE MIX OF ORDERS CAN SHIFT BETWEEN ADVANCE/FUTURES AND AT-ONCE ORDERS. IN ADDITION, EXCHANGE RATE

FLUCTUATIONS AS WELL AS DIFFERING LEVELS OF ORDER CANCELLATIONS CAN CAUSE DIFFERENCES IN THE COMPARISONS BETWEEN FUTURES ORDERS AND ACTUAL REVENUES. MOREOVER, A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR REVENUES IS NOT DERIVED FROM FUTURES ORDERS, INCLUDING

WHOLESALE SALES OF EQUIPMENT,

IN FISCAL 2003, OUR CONSOLIDATED GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE IMPROVED 1.7 POINTS

AS COMPARED TO FISCAL 2002, FROM 39.3% TO 41.0%. SIGNIFICANT FACTORS CONTRIBUTING TO THE IMPROVED GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE WERE AS FOLLOWS.

(1)

PRODUCT COST REDUCTIONS RESULTING FROM OUR GLOBAL INITIATIVES TO IMPROVE EFFICIENCY AND REDUCE MATERIALS COSTS.

(2)

A HIGHER MIX OF SALES OF CLASSIC FOOTWEAR MODELS WHICH ARE GENERALLY MORE PROFITABLE THAN OUR MORE COMPLEX PERFORMANCE MODELS.

LOWER PRICING OF NIKE GOLF PRODUCTS AS A RESULT OF MARKET CONDITIONS DISCUSSED ABOVE

PARTIALLY OFFSET THESE POSITIVE MARGIN DRIVERS. CHANGES IN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES DID NOT HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE IN FISCAL 2003 AS THE BENEFIT OF STRONGER HEDGE RATES IN SOME CURRENCIES WAS OFFSET BY WEAKER HEDGE

RATES IN OTHER CURRENCIES. A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF PRODUCT PURCHASES FOR FISCAL 2004 ARE ALREADY HEDGED AND WE EXPECT THAT CHANGES IN YEAR-OVER-YEAR HEDGE RATES WILL HAVE A NET POSITIVE EFFECT ON OUR GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE IN FISCAL 2004, AS THE

BENEFITS OF STRONGER EURO HEDGE RATES MORE THAN OFFSET WEAKER HEDGE RATES IN OTHER CURRENCIES.

SELLING AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE INCREASED AS A PERCENTAGE OF REVENUES FROM 28.5% IN FISCAL 2002 TO 29.3% IN FISCAL 2003. BOTH DEMAND CREATION AND OPERATING OVERHEAD EXPENSE INCREASED AS A PERCENTAGE OF REVENUES.

DEMAND CREATION EXPENSE GREW FROM $1,027.9 MILLION IN FISCAL 2002 TO $1,168.6 MILLION IN FISCAL 2003. HIGHER COSTS INCURRED IN THE EMEA REGION DROVE THE GROWTH IN DEMAND CREATION EXPENSE, REFLECTING, 1) A STRONGER EURO CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE

COMPARED TO THE U.S. DOLLAR, WHICH RESULTED IN HIGHER U.S. DOLLAR EXPENSES FOR COSTS THAT ARE EURO-DENOMINATED, 2) OUR NEW ENDORSEMENT AGREEMENT WITH THE MANCHESTER UNITED SOCCER TEAM THAT BECAME EFFECTIVE IN AUGUST 2002, AND 3) COSTS OF OUR WORLD

CUP MARKETING CAMPAIGN INCURRED IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2003. HIGHER DEMAND CREATION EXPENSES WERE ALSO INCURRED IN THE ASIA PACIFIC AND AMERICAS REGIONS DUE TO THE WORLD CUP MARKETING CAMPAIGN. WE ALSO INCREASED DEMAND CREATION SPENDING IN

THE U.S. IN ORDER TO DRIVE CONTINUED CONSUMER DEMAND FOR FOOTWEAR WHILE WE REALIGN OUR DISTRIBUTION TO RETAIL CUSTOMERS.

OPERATING OVERHEAD INCREASED FROM $1,792.5 MILLION IN FISCAL 2002 TO $1,969.0 MILLION IN FISCAL 2003. MAJOR DRIVERS OF THIS INCREASE WERE THE STRONGER

EURO EXCHANGE RATE, INCREMENTAL COSTS RELATED TO OUR ON-GOING DEVELOPMENT OF SYSTEMS AND PROCESSES SUPPORTING OUR WORLDWIDE SUPPLY CHAIN, (PRIMARILY REFLECTED IN THE CORPORATE LINE IN OUR SEGMENT PRESENTATION OF PRE-TAX INCOME IN

NOTE 17 

OPERATING SEGMENTS AND RELATED INFORMATION

), INVESTMENTS IN HEADCOUNT FOR OUR NIKE GOLF BUSINESS, THE ADDITION OF HURLEY OVERHEAD COSTS BEGINNING IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF FISCAL 2002, AND OVERHEAD COSTS OF ADDITIONAL RETAIL STORES IN EMEA AND

ASIA PACIFIC.

AS PART OF OUR WORLDWIDE SUPPLY CHAIN

INITIATIVE, WE IMPLEMENTED NEW SYSTEMS IN THE EMEA REGION IN FISCAL 2003. PRIOR TO THE EMEA REGION IMPLEMENTATION, WE IMPLEMENTED NEW SYSTEMS AND PROCESSES FOR CERTAIN GLOBAL FUNCTIONS AND FOR OUR U.S. AND CANADIAN BUSINESSES. OVER THE NEXT FEW

YEARS, WE WILL CONTINUE TO ENHANCE AND REFINE THE SYSTEMS AND PROCESSES IN THE U.S., EMEA AND CANADA AS WELL AS IMPLEMENT OUR NEW SUPPLY CHAIN PLATFORM IN THE REMAINING COUNTRIES IN WHICH WE OPERATE. OVER THIS TIME PERIOD, OPERATING OVERHEAD EXPENSE

WILL CONTINUE TO INCLUDE COSTS OF THE SUPPLY CHAIN INITIATIVE AS WELL AS COSTS FOR SUPPORTING OUR EXISTING SYSTEM INFRASTRUCTURE FOR THOSE BUSINESSES WHERE WE HAVE NOT YET IMPLEMENTED THE NEW SYSTEMS. THIS INITIATIVE IS INTENDED TO IMPROVE REVENUE

(BY INCREASING OUR ABILITY TO RESPOND TO MARKET CONDITIONS), MARGINS (BY LOWERING CLOSE-OUTS AND DISTRIBUTION COSTS) AND CASH FLOW (BY REDUCING INVENTORIES). IN THE U.S., WHERE THE NEW SYSTEMS HAVE BEEN IN PLACE FOR OVER A YEAR, WE HAVE BEGUN TO SEE

IMPROVEMENTS IN SEVERAL KEY PERFORMANCE MEASURES. THE ULTIMATE LEVEL OF BENEFIT, IF ANY, TO REVENUES, MARGINS, AND CASH FLOWS WILL NOT BE KNOWN UNTIL THE NEW SYSTEMS AND PROCESSES HAVE BEEN IMPLEMENTED IN THE REMAINING COUNTRIES IN WHICH WE OPERATE

AND GLOBALLY INTEGRATED OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS.

INTEREST

EXPENSE DECREASED FROM $47.6 MILLION IN FISCAL 2002 TO $42.9 MILLION IN FISCAL 2003, A DECLINE OF 10%. THE DECREASE REFLECTED BOTH LOWER INTEREST RATES AND LOWER AVERAGE DEBT LEVELS, AS WE HAVE USED CASH FLOW FROM OPERATIONS TO REDUCE TOTAL DEBT.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

OTHER INCOME/EXPENSE WAS NET EXPENSE OF $79.9 MILLION COMPARED TO NET EXPENSE OF $3.0 MILLION IN FISCAL

2002. SIGNIFICANT AMOUNTS INCLUDED IN OTHER INCOME/EXPENSE WERE INTEREST INCOME, PROFIT SHARING EXPENSE, GOODWILL AMORTIZATION (FISCAL 2002 ONLY), AND CERTAIN FOREIGN CURRENCY GAINS AND LOSSES.

AN INCREASE IN NET FOREIGN CURRENCY LOSSES WAS THE LARGEST CONTRIBUTOR TO THE

INCREASE IN OTHER EXPENSE VERSUS LAST YEAR. THESE FOREIGN CURRENCY LOSSES WERE PRIMARILY DUE TO HEDGE LOSSES ON INTERCOMPANY CHARGES TO A EUROPEAN SUBSIDIARY, WHOSE FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY IS THE EURO. THESE LOSSES ARE REFLECTED IN THE CORPORATE LINE IN

OUR SEGMENT PRESENTATION OF PRE-TAX INCOME IN

NOTE 17  OPERATING SEGMENTS AND RELATED INFORMATION

. THE HEDGE LOSSES REFLECTED THAT THE EURO HAS STRENGTHENED CONSIDERABLY SINCE WE ENTERED INTO THESE HEDGE CONTRACTS. IN FISCAL 2003, NET

FOREIGN CURRENCY LOSSES IN OTHER INCOME/EXPENSE WERE MORE THAN OFFSET BY FAVORABLE TRANSLATION OF FOREIGN CURRENCY DENOMINATED PROFITS. OUR ESTIMATE OF THE NET IMPACT OF THESE LOSSES AND THE FAVORABLE TRANSLATION IS A $13 MILLION ADDITION TO

CONSOLIDATED INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES. CONSISTENT WITH OUR EXISTING POLICIES, WE HAVE CONTINUED TO HEDGE ANTICIPATED INTERCOMPANY CHARGES FOR FISCAL 2004. SINCE THE EURO HAS CONTINUED TO STRENGTHEN SINCE THESE HEDGE CONTRACTS WERE EXECUTED, WE

EXPECT TO CONTINUE TO INCUR SOME HEDGE LOSSES IN FISCAL 2004. HOWEVER, WE EXPECT THE NET IMPACT OF THE HEDGE LOSSES AND THE OFFSETTING POSITIVE TRANSLATION IMPACT WILL RESULT IN A NET BENEFIT TO FISCAL 2004 CONSOLIDATED NET INCOME VERSUS THE PRIOR

YEAR.

OUR FISCAL 2003 EFFECTIVE TAX RATE WAS 34.1%, RELATIVELY

CONSISTENT WITH THE FISCAL 2002 EFFECTIVE RATE OF 34.3%.

INCLUDED IN FISCAL 2003 NET INCOME WAS A $266.1 MILLION CHARGE FOR THE CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF IMPLEMENTING FAS 142. THIS CHARGE RELATED TO THE IMPAIRMENT OF GOODWILL AND TRADEMARKS ASSOCIATED WITH BAUER NIKE HOCKEY AND THE GOODWILL OF COLE

HAAN, REFLECTING THAT THE FAIR VALUES WE ESTIMATED FOR THESE ASSETS WERE LESS THAN THE CARRYING VALUES. IN ADDITION, THE ADOPTION OF THIS ACCOUNTING STANDARD RESULTED IN A REDUCTION TO GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSET AMORTIZATION OF $13.1 MILLION AS

COMPARED TO FISCAL 2002. SEE THE ACCOMPANYING

AS DISCUSSED

ABOVE, OUR FISCAL 2002 AND FISCAL 2001 NIKE GOLF INFORMATION HAS BEEN RECLASSIFIED TO CONFORM TO THE FISCAL 2003 PRESENTATION. THIS PRESENTATION REFLECTS SIGNIFICANT NIKE GOLF OPERATIONS AS A SEPARATE BUSINESS IN THE OTHER CATEGORY RATHER THAN

WITHIN EACH OF OUR GEOGRAPHICAL REGIONS. THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION OF FISCAL 2002 RESULTS VERSUS FISCAL 2001 BY REGION REFLECTS THIS RECLASSIFICATION OF NIKE GOLF OPERATIONS. THIS RECLASSIFICATION DID NOT RESULT IN ANY CHANGE TO OUR PREVIOUSLY

REPORTED CONSOLIDATED RESULTS, NOR DID IT RESULT IN A SIGNIFICANT CHANGE TO THE PREVIOUSLY REPORTED REVENUE AND PROFITABILITY TRENDS IN EACH OF OUR REGIONAL BUSINESSES IN FISCAL 2002. THIS RECLASSIFICATION DID RESULT IN SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER REVENUES

AND PROFITS REPORTED IN THE OTHER CATEGORY.

24

TABLE OF CONTENTS

IN THE U.S. REGION, REVENUES WERE FLAT IN FISCAL 2002 VERSUS FISCAL 2001, REFLECTING INCREASED SALES OF

APPAREL AND EQUIPMENT OFFSET BY DECREASED SALES OF FOOTWEAR. THE INCREASED SALES IN APPAREL REFLECTED HIGHER DEMAND FOR IN-LINE PRODUCTS, PARTICULARLY FOR NIKE BRAND AND BRAND JORDAN BASKETBALL APPAREL, MORE THAN OFFSETTING THE EFFECT OF THE

EXPIRATION OF OUR APPAREL LICENSE AGREEMENT WITH THE NATIONAL FOOTBALL LEAGUE IN FISCAL 2001. WHILE IN-LINE SALES OF FOOTWEAR INCREASED IN FISCAL 2002, PARTICULARLY IN THE MID-RANGE PRICE SEGMENT, CLOSE-OUT SALES DECREASED SIGNIFICANTLY. THE

REDUCTION IN CLOSE-OUT SALES REFLECTED BOTH OUR EFFORTS TO LIMIT THE AVAILABILITY OF CLOSE-OUT PRODUCTS IN THE MARKETPLACE (IN ORDER TO BUILD OVERALL PROFITABILITY) AND RELATIVELY HIGH LEVELS OF CLOSE-OUT SALES IN THE LAST HALF OF FISCAL 2001 DUE TO

SUPPLY CHAIN SYSTEM DISRUPTIONS. AS IN THE APPAREL BUSINESS, SALES OF NIKE BRAND AND BRAND JORDAN BASKETBALL FOOTWEAR PRODUCTS WERE THE PRIMARY DRIVERS OF INCREASED WHOLESALE SALES OF IN-LINE FOOTWEAR DURING THE YEAR.

DESPITE REVENUES AND SELLING AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE BEING ESSENTIALLY

CONSISTENT WITH FISCAL 2001, U.S. PRE-TAX INCOME INCREASED FROM $905.0 MILLION TO $956.0 MILLION, DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY AN IMPROVED GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE.

IN FISCAL 2002, REVENUES FROM OUR INTERNATIONAL REGIONS GREW 6% VERSUS THE PRIOR YEAR. CHANGES IN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES DECREASED THE INTERNATIONAL

REGION GROWTH RATE 6 PERCENTAGE POINTS AND DECREASED OUR CONSOLIDATED GROWTH RATE 3 PERCENTAGE POINTS. FISCAL 2002 REPORTED REVENUES IN EMEA INCREASED BY 6% OVER FISCAL 2001, INCLUDING A 4 PERCENTAGE POINT DECREASE DUE TO CHANGES IN CURRENCY

EXCHANGE RATES. EXCLUDING THE NEGATIVE EFFECT OF CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES, EMEA REVENUES GREW IN EACH OF OUR BUSINESS UNITS, FOOTWEAR, APPAREL, AND EQUIPMENT AND IN ALMOST EVERY COUNTRY IN THE REGION, REFLECTING INCREASING DEMAND FOR NIKE BRAND

PRODUCTS THROUGHOUT EMEA.

EMEA PRE-TAX INCOME GREW 16% FROM

$363.4 MILLION TO $422.4 MILLION. GROWTH IN REVENUES AND A HIGHER GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE DROVE THE INCREASE IN PRE-TAX INCOME.

IN OUR ASIA PACIFIC REGION, REPORTED REVENUES GREW 7%, INCLUDING A 10 PERCENTAGE POINT DECREASE DUE TO CHANGES IN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES. ASIA PACIFIC

REVENUES GREW IN EACH BUSINESS UNIT AND IN ALMOST EVERY COUNTRY IN THE REGION, WITH THE LARGEST GROWTH COMING FROM JAPAN, KOREA, AND CHINA.

PRE-TAX INCOME FOR THE ASIA PACIFIC REGION INCREASED FROM $184.4 MILLION TO $216.2 MILLION. THE INCREASE IN REVENUES AND LOWER SELLING AND ADMINISTRATIVE

EXPENSE AS A PERCENTAGE OF REVENUES DROVE THE GROWTH IN PRE-TAX INCOME, WHICH WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECLINE IN GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE.

THE AMERICAS REGION REPORTED REVENUES GREW 5%, INCLUDING A 7 PERCENTAGE POINT DECREASE DUE TO CHANGES IN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES, DESPITE A DROP-OFF IN

SALES IN ARGENTINA DURING THE SECOND HALF OF FISCAL 2002 AS A RESULT OF THE COUNTRYS ECONOMIC CRISIS. REVENUES IN THE AMERICAS REGION GREW IN EACH OF OUR BUSINESS UNITS, LED BY GROWTH IN CANADA, MEXICO, AND BRAZIL.

PRE-TAX INCOME FOR THE AMERICAS REGION INCREASED FROM $81.6 MILLION TO $92.1

MILLION. THE INCREASE IN REVENUES AND LOWER SELLING AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE AS A PERCENTAGE OF REVENUES DROVE THE GROWTH IN PRE-TAX INCOME, WHICH WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECLINE IN GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE.

IN FISCAL 2002, OTHER REVENUES, INCLUDING REVENUES FROM BAUER NIKE HOCKEY,

COLE HAAN, HURLEY, AND NIKE GOLF, INCREASED 20% TO $816.6 MILLION, DRIVEN BY GROWTH IN NIKE GOLF. THE HURLEY ACQUISITION DID NOT HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON FISCAL 2002 REVENUES SINCE THE ACQUISITION DID NOT OCCUR UNTIL THE LAST QUARTER OF FISCAL

2002.

OTHER PRE-TAX INCOME DECLINED FROM $74.2 MILLION TO

$56.8 MILLION, DRIVEN BY A DECLINE IN PROFITABILITY AT COLE HAAN. DESPITE SLIGHT REVENUE GROWTH AT COLE HAAN DURING THE YEAR, PRE-TAX INCOME DECLINED DUE TO RELATIVELY HIGH DISCOUNTING AND INVENTORY OBSOLESCENCE AS A RESULT OF DEPRESSED CONSUMER

DEMAND IN THE WAKE OF THE SEPTEMBER 11, 2001 TERRORIST ATTACKS.

25

TABLE OF CONTENTS

OUR GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE IMPROVED FROM 39.0% IN FISCAL 2001 TO 39.3% IN FISCAL 2002. FACTORS

CONTRIBUTING TO THE IMPROVED GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE IN FISCAL 2002 WERE AS FOLLOWS.

(1)

HIGHER IN-LINE PRICING MARGINS IN EMEA, DUE TO THE EFFECT OF HIGHER PRICES EFFECTIVE AT THE BEGINNING OF THE FISCAL YEAR AND SOURCING AND WAREHOUSING EFFICIENCIES, PARTIALLY OFFSET

BY THE EFFECT OF WEAKER EURO/U.S. DOLLAR CURRENCY HEDGE RATES RELATIVE TO FISCAL 2001.

(2)

HIGHER FOOTWEAR MARGINS IN THE U.S. DUE IN PART TO LOWER PRODUCT COSTS AND LOWER TRANSPORTATION COSTS, AS A RESULT OF BOTH EFFECTIVE NEGOTIATIONS WITH SHIPPERS AND LOWER AIR FREIGHT

COSTS INCURRED. RELATIVELY HIGHER AIR FREIGHT COSTS WERE INCURRED IN FISCAL 2001 DUE TO SUPPLY CHAIN SYSTEM PROBLEMS.

(3)

A HIGHER MIX OF IN-LINE SALES VERSUS CLOSE-OUT SALES OF U.S. FOOTWEAR, REFLECTING INCREASED DEMAND FOR IN-LINE FOOTWEAR AND LOWER CLOSE-OUT SALES AS COMPARED TO FISCAL 2001 AS

DISCUSSED ABOVE.

SELLING AND ADMINISTRATIVE

EXPENSE INCREASED AS A PERCENTAGE OF REVENUES FROM 28.3% IN FISCAL 2001 TO 28.5% IN FISCAL 2002. OPERATING OVERHEAD INCREASED 6% IN FISCAL 2002. SIGNIFICANT DRIVERS OF THE INCREASED OPERATING OVERHEAD INCLUDED INCREASED INVESTMENT IN OUR SUPPLY

CHAIN INITIATIVE, ADDITIONAL HEADCOUNT TO SUPPORT OUR GOLF AND EUROPEAN BUSINESSES DUE TO BUSINESS GROWTH, ADDITIONAL EXPENSE FOR COMPENSATION PROGRAMS TIED TO OUR PROFITABILITY AND STOCK PERFORMANCE, AND COSTS FOR ADDITIONAL RETAIL STORES PRIMARILY

IN OUR EMEA AND ASIA PACIFIC REGIONS.

DEMAND CREATION EXPENSE

WAS $1,027.9 MILLION IN FISCAL 2002 VERSUS $998.2 MILLION IN FISCAL 2001, WHICH WAS CONSISTENT BETWEEN YEARS AS A PERCENTAGE OF REVENUES. OUR FISCAL 2002 DEMAND CREATION EXPENSE REFLECTED INCREMENTAL SPENDING FOR OUR WORLD CUP 2002 MARKETING

CAMPAIGN, WHICH BEGAN IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF FISCAL 2002.

INTEREST EXPENSE DECREASED 19%, FROM $58.7 MILLION IN FISCAL 2001 TO $47.6 MILLION IN FISCAL 2002. THE DECREASE REFLECTED BOTH LOWER INTEREST RATES AND LOWER AVERAGE DEBT LEVELS, AS WE USED CASH FLOW FROM OPERATIONS TO REDUCE TOTAL DEBT.

OTHER INCOME/EXPENSE WAS A NET EXPENSE OF $3.0 MILLION IN

FISCAL 2002 VERSUS A NET EXPENSE OF $34.1 MILLION IN FISCAL 2001. SIGNIFICANT AMOUNTS INCLUDED IN OTHER INCOME/EXPENSE INCLUDED INTEREST INCOME, PROFIT SHARING EXPENSE, GOODWILL AMORTIZATION, CERTAIN FOREIGN CURRENCY GAINS AND LOSSES, AND ASSET

DISPOSAL GAINS/LOSSES. NET OTHER EXPENSE DECREASED BETWEEN YEARS AS THE FISCAL 2001 AMOUNT INCLUDED CHARGES FOR CONTRACTUAL SETTLEMENTS THAT DID NOT RECUR IN FISCAL 2002. IN ADDITION, FISCAL 2002 OTHER INCOME/EXPENSE INCLUDED CREDITS RELATED TO THE

FAVORABLE RESOLUTION OF SOME OUTSTANDING CLAIMS.

OUR FISCAL

2002 EFFECTIVE TAX RATE WAS 34.3% AS COMPARED TO 36.0% IN FISCAL 2001. AS REQUIRED BY U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES, WE DO NOT ACCRUE A U.S. TAX LIABILITY ON FOREIGN EARNINGS PERMANENTLY INVESTED OFFSHORE. THE LOWER EFFECTIVE TAX

RATE IN FISCAL 2002 IS PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF A LARGER AMOUNT OF FOREIGN EARNINGS PERMANENTLY INVESTED OFFSHORE IN FISCAL 2002 THAN IN FISCAL 2001.

RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

IN JUNE 2001, THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD (FASB) ISSUED SFAS NO. 143, ACCOUNTING FOR ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS (FAS 143). THIS

STATEMENT REQUIRES THAT A LIABILITY FOR AN ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATION BE RECOGNIZED AT FAIR VALUE IN THE PERIOD THE OBLIGATION IS INCURRED AND THE ASSOCIATED RETIREMENT COSTS BE CAPITALIZED AS PART OF THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF THE RELATED TANGIBLE

LONG-LIVED ASSET. ALL PROVISIONS OF THIS STATEMENT WILL BE EFFECTIVE FOR THE COMPANY ON JUNE 1, 2003. WE DO NOT EXPECT THAT THE ADOPTION OF FAS 143 WILL HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL POSITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

IN JUNE 2002, THE FASB ISSUED SFAS NO. 146 ACCOUNTING

FOR COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH EXIT OR DISPOSAL ACTIVITIES (FAS 146). THIS STATEMENT SUPERCEDES EMERGING ISSUES TASK FORCE (EITF) ISSUE NO. 94-3 LIABILITY RECOGNITION FOR CERTAIN EMPLOYEE TERMINATION BENEFITS AND OTHER COSTS TO EXIT AN

ACTIVITY (INCLUDING CERTAIN COSTS INCURRED IN A RESTRUCTURING), FAS 146 REQUIRES THAT A LIABILITY FOR A COST ASSOCIATED WITH AN EXIT OR DISPOSAL ACTIVITY BE RECOGNIZED WHEN THE LIABILITY IS INCURRED. UNDER EITF 94-3, A LIABILITY WAS RECOGNIZED

AT THE DATE AN ENTITY COMMITTED TO AN EXIT PLAN. FAS 146 ALSO ESTABLISHES THAT THE LIABILITY SHOULD INITIALLY BE MEASURED AND RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE. THE PROVISIONS OF FAS 146 ARE EFFECTIVE FOR ANY EXIT AND DISPOSAL ACTIVITIES INITIATED AFTER

26

TABLE OF CONTENTS

DECEMBER 31, 2002. WE HAVE NOT ENTERED INTO ANY SIGNIFICANT EXIT OR DISPOSAL ACTIVITIES SINCE THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF THIS RULE. AS SUCH, FAS 146 HAS NOT HAD

AN IMPACT ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL POSITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, AND NO SIGNIFICANT IMPACT IS EXPECTED IN THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE.

IN NOVEMBER 2002, THE FASB ISSUED FASB INTERPRETATION NO. 45, GUARANTORS ACCOUNTING AND DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS FOR GUARANTEES, INCLUDING

INDIRECT GUARANTEES OF INDEBTEDNESS OF OTHERS (FIN 45). FIN 45 REQUIRES THAT UPON ISSUANCE OF A GUARANTEE, A GUARANTOR MUST RECOGNIZE A LIABILITY FOR THE FAIR VALUE OF AN OBLIGATION ASSUMED UNDER A GUARANTEE. FIN 45 ALSO REQUIRES ADDITIONAL

DISCLOSURES BY A GUARANTOR IN ITS INTERIM AND ANNUAL FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ABOUT THE OBLIGATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH GUARANTEES ISSUED. THE RECOGNITION PROVISIONS OF FIN 45 ARE EFFECTIVE FOR ANY GUARANTEES ISSUED OR MODIFIED AFTER DECEMBER 31, 2002. THE

DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS OF FIN 45 WERE EFFECTIVE BEGINNING WITH THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2003.

IN CONNECTION WITH VARIOUS CONTRACTS AND AGREEMENTS, WE PROVIDE ROUTINE INDEMNIFICATIONS RELATING TO THE ENFORCEABILITY OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS,

COVERAGE FOR LEGAL ISSUES THAT ARISE, AND OTHER ITEMS THAT FALL UNDER THE SCOPE OF FIN 45. CURRENTLY, WE HAVE SEVERAL SUCH AGREEMENTS IN PLACE. HOWEVER, BASED ON OUR HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND ESTIMATED PROBABILITY OF FUTURE LOSS, WE HAVE DETERMINED

THAT THE FAIR VALUE OF SUCH INDEMNIFICATIONS IS NOT MATERIAL. HENCE, THE ADOPTION OF FIN 45 HAS NOT HAD AN IMPACT ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL POSITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, AND NO SIGNIFICANT IMPACT IS EXPECTED IN THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE.

IN DECEMBER 2002, THE FASB ISSUED SFAS NO. 148

ACCOUNTING FOR STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION TRANSITION AND DISCLOSUREAN AMENDMENT OF FASB STATEMENT NO. 123 (FAS 148). THIS STATEMENT AMENDS SFAS NO. 123 ACCOUNTING FOR STOCK BASED COMPENSATION (FAS 123) TO PROVIDE

ALTERNATIVE METHODS OF VOLUNTARILY TRANSITIONING TO THE FAIR VALUE BASED METHOD OF ACCOUNTING FOR STOCK-BASED EMPLOYEE COMPENSATION. FAS 148 ALSO AMENDS THE DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS OF FAS 123 TO REQUIRE DISCLOSURE OF THE METHOD USED TO ACCOUNT FOR

STOCK-BASED EMPLOYEE COMPENSATION AND THE EFFECT OF THE METHOD ON REPORTED RESULTS IN BOTH ANNUAL AND INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. THE DISCLOSURE PROVISIONS ARE EFFECTIVE FOR US BEGINNING WITH THIS FISCAL 2003 ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K. THE ANNUAL

IMPACT OF A CHANGE TO THE FAIR VALUE MODEL PRESCRIBED BY FAS 123 HAS BEEN DISCLOSED IN OUR PREVIOUS 10-K FILINGS, AND THE APPLICABLE DISCLOSURES IN THIS REPORT ARE IN

NOTE 1

AND

NOTE 10

OF THE

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS

. AT THIS TIME, WE PLAN TO CONTINUE TO ACCOUNT FOR STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION USING THE INTRINSIC METHOD PRESCRIBED IN ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES BOARD OPINION NO. 25, ACCOUNTING FOR STOCK ISSUED TO EMPLOYEES, RATHER THAN CHANGE

TO THE FAS 123 FAIR VALUE METHOD.

IN JANUARY 2003, THE FASB

ISSUED FASB INTERPRETATION NO. 46, CONSOLIDATION OF VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES (FIN 46). THIS INTERPRETATION OF ACCOUNTING RESEARCH BULLETIN NO. 51, CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, ADDRESSES CONSOLIDATION OF VARIABLE

INTEREST ENTITIES. FIN 46 REQUIRES CERTAIN VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES TO BE CONSOLIDATED BY THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY IF THE ENTITY DOES NOT EFFECTIVELY DISPERSE RISKS AMONG THE PARTIES INVOLVED. THE PROVISIONS OF FIN 46 ARE EFFECTIVE IMMEDIATELY FOR

THOSE VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES CREATED AFTER JANUARY 31, 2003. THE PROVISIONS ARE EFFECTIVE FOR THE FIRST PERIOD BEGINNING AFTER JUNE 15, 2003 FOR THOSE VARIABLE INTERESTS HELD PRIOR TO FEBRUARY 1, 2003. WE DO NOT CURRENTLY HAVE ANY VARIABLE

INTEREST ENTITIES AS DEFINED IN FIN 46. ACCORDINGLY, WE DO NOT EXPECT THE PROVISIONS OF FIN 46 TO AFFECT OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL POSITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

FISCAL 2003 CASH FLOW ACTIVITY

CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATIONS WAS $917.4 MILLION IN FISCAL 2003, COMPARED TO $1,081.5 MILLION IN FISCAL 2002. OUR PRIMARY SOURCE OF OPERATING CASH FLOW WAS

INCOME BEFORE THE CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF AN ACCOUNTING CHANGE OF $740.1 MILLION. OPERATING CASH FLOW DECREASED COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR DUE TO INCREASED INVESTMENT IN CERTAIN WORKING CAPITAL COMPONENTS DURING FISCAL 2003, INCLUDING INVENTORIES.

WHILE A DECLINE IN INVENTORY LEVELS PROVIDED A SOURCE OF CASH DURING FISCAL 2002, AN INCREASE IN INVENTORY LEVELS DURING FISCAL 2003 RESULTED IN A USE OF CASH, PRIMARILY DUE TO OUR DECISION TO PURCHASE PRODUCT FOR THE U.S. BACK-TO-SCHOOL

SELLING SEASON EARLIER THAN WE DID LAST YEAR IN ORDER TO IMPROVE THE TIMELINESS OF SHIPMENTS TO CUSTOMERS.

CASH USED BY INVESTING ACTIVITIES DURING FISCAL 2003 WAS $215.6 MILLION, COMPARED TO $302.8 MILLION INVESTED DURING FISCAL 2002. THE MOST SIGNIFICANT

INVESTING ACTIVITIES IN BOTH PERIODS WERE EXPENDITURES FOR

27

TABLE OF CONTENTS

COMPUTER EQUIPMENT AND SOFTWARE RELATED TO OUR SUPPLY CHAIN INITIATIVE AND CONTINUED INVESTMENT IN NIKE-OWNED RETAIL STORES. SPENDING FOR BOTH OF THESE

ACTIVITIES DECLINED IN FISCAL 2003 AS COMPARED TO FISCAL 2002. ADDITIONALLY, FISCAL 2002 SPENDING INCLUDED OUR ACQUISITION OF ALL OF THE ASSETS AND SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE LIABILITIES OF HURLEY INTERNATIONAL LLC, AN ACTION SPORTS AND YOUTH

LIFESTYLE BRAND COMPANY. COSTS INCURRED FOR DISTRIBUTION CENTER PROJECTS INCREASED IN FISCAL 2003, THE LARGEST PROJECT BEING CONSTRUCTION OF A NEW STORAGE BUILDING IN JAPAN, WITH SCHEDULED OPENING IN THE SECOND HALF OF FISCAL 2004. DURING FISCAL

2004, WE WILL CONTINUE TO MAKE INVESTMENTS IN SYSTEMS IMPROVEMENTS (MOST NOTABLY THE SUPPLY CHAIN INITIATIVE), RETAIL EXPANSION, AND OUR WORLDWIDE DISTRIBUTION CENTER FACILITIES. ADDITIONALLY, DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2004, WE ENTERED INTO

AN AGREEMENT TO PURCHASE CONVERSE INC., DISCUSSED FURTHER BELOW.

CASH USED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES IN FISCAL 2003 WAS $605.2 MILLION, UP FROM $478.2 MILLION IN THE PRIOR YEAR. THIS AMOUNT INCLUDED USES OF CASH FOR DIVIDENDS TO SHAREHOLDERS, A NET REDUCTION IN DEBT, AND SHARE REPURCHASES. THESE USES OF

CASH WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY PROCEEDS FROM THE EXERCISE OF EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTIONS.

THE SHARE REPURCHASES WERE PART OF A $1.0 BILLION SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM THAT BEGAN IN FISCAL 2001, AFTER COMPLETION OF A FOUR-YEAR, $1.0 BILLION PROGRAM IN FISCAL 2000. IN FISCAL 2003, WE REPURCHASED 4.0 MILLION

SHARES OF NIKES CLASS B COMMON STOCK FOR $191.0 MILLION. TO DATE, UNDER THE CURRENT PROGRAM, WE HAVE PURCHASED A TOTAL OF 12.3 MILLION SHARES OF NIKES CLASS B COMMON STOCK FOR $585.7 MILLION. WE EXPECT TO CONTINUE TO FUND THE CURRENT

PROGRAM FROM OPERATING CASH FLOW. THE TIMING AND THE ULTIMATE AMOUNT OF SHARES PURCHASED UNDER THE PROGRAM WILL BE DICTATED BY OUR CAPITAL NEEDS AND STOCK MARKET CONDITIONS.

THE AMOUNTS LISTED FOR

ENDORSEMENT CONTRACTS REPRESENT APPROXIMATE AMOUNTS OF BASE COMPENSATION AND MINIMUM GUARANTEED ROYALTY FEES WE ARE OBLIGATED TO PAY ATHLETE AND SPORT TEAM ENDORSERS OF OUR PRODUCTS. ACTUAL PAYMENTS UNDER SOME CONTRACTS WILL LIKELY BE HIGHER THAN

THE AMOUNTS LISTED AS THESE CONTRACTS PROVIDE FOR BONUSES TO BE PAID TO THE ENDORSERS BASED UPON ATHLETIC ACHIEVEMENTS IN FUTURE PERIODS. ACTUAL PAYMENTS UNDER SOME CONTRACTS MAY ALSO BE LOWER AS A LIMITED NUMBER OF CONTRACTS INCLUDE PROVISIONS FOR

REDUCED PAYMENTS IF ATHLETE PERFORMANCE DECLINES IN FUTURE PERIODS.

IN ADDITION TO THE CASH PAYMENTS DISCLOSED ABOVE, WE ARE OBLIGATED TO FURNISH THE ENDORSERS WITH NIKE PRODUCTS FOR THEIR USE. IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO DETERMINE HOW MUCH WE WILL SPEND ON THIS PRODUCT ON AN ANNUAL BASIS AS THE CONTRACTS DO NOT

STIPULATE A SPECIFIC AMOUNT OF CASH TO BE SPENT ON THE PRODUCT. THE AMOUNT OF PRODUCT PROVIDED TO THE ENDORSERS WILL DEPEND ON MANY FACTORS INCLUDING GENERAL PLAYING CONDITIONS, THE NUMBER OF SPORTING EVENTS IN WHICH THEY PARTICIPATE, AND OUR OWN

DECISIONS REGARDING PRODUCT AND MARKETING INITIATIVES. IN ADDITION, THE COSTS TO DESIGN, DEVELOP, SOURCE, AND PURCHASE THE PRODUCTS FURNISHED TO THE ENDORSERS ARE INCURRED OVER A PERIOD OF TIME AND ARE NOT NECESSARILY TRACKED SEPARATELY FROM SIMILAR

COSTS INCURRED FOR PRODUCTS SOLD TO CUSTOMERS.

AN OUTSOURCING

CONTRACTOR PROVIDES US WITH INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT SERVICES THROUGH 2006. THE AMOUNT OF THE PAYMENTS IN FUTURE YEARS DEPENDS ON OUR LEVEL OF MONTHLY USE OF THE DIFFERENT ELEMENTS OF THE CONTRACTORS SERVICES. IF WE WERE TO

ON JULY 9, 2003, WE ENTERED INTO AN AGREEMENT TO PURCHASE ALL OF THE EQUITY SHARES OF CONVERSE INC., A WIDELY RECOGNIZED FOOTWEAR COMPANY BASED IN

MASSACHUSETTS, FOR $305 MILLION CASH. PRIOR TO CLOSING, THIS TRANSACTION IS SUBJECT TO REGULATORY REVIEW, INCLUDING U.S. GOVERNMENT REVIEW UNDER THE HART-SCOTT-RODINO PREMERGER NOTIFICATION ACT. IF THE ACQUISITION IS COMPLETED, WE DO NOT EXPECT IT

WILL HAVE A SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON OUR LIQUIDITY, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR FINANCIAL POSITION IN THE SHORT TERM. WHILE WE DO EXPECT A POSITIVE IMPACT ON OUR LONG-TERM PROFITABILITY FROM THIS ACQUISITION, WE CANNOT REASONABLY ESTIMATE THIS IMPACT AT

THIS TIME.

CAPITAL RESOURCES

IN OCTOBER 2001, WE FILED A SHELF REGISTRATION STATEMENT WITH THE SECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (SEC) UNDER WHICH $1.0 BILLION IN DEBT SECURITIES MAY BE ISSUED. IN MAY 2002, WE COMMENCED A MEDIUM-TERM NOTE PROGRAM UNDER THE SHELF REGISTRATION THAT ALLOWS US TO ISSUE UP TO $500.0 MILLION IN MEDIUM-TERM NOTES, AS OUR

CAPITAL NEEDS DICTATE. WE ENTERED INTO THIS PROGRAM TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL LIQUIDITY TO MEET OUR WORKING CAPITAL AND GENERAL CORPORATE CASH REQUIREMENTS. DURING FISCAL 2003, WE ISSUED A TOTAL OF $90 MILLION IN NOTES UNDER THE MEDIUM-TERM NOTE

PROGRAM. THE NOTES HAVE COUPON RATES THAT RANGE FROM 4.80% TO 5.66%. THE MATURITIES RANGE FROM JULY 9, 2007 TO AUGUST 7, 2012. FOR EACH OF THE NOTES, WE HAVE ENTERED INTO INTEREST RATE SWAP AGREEMENTS WHEREBY WE RECEIVE FIXED INTEREST PAYMENTS AT

THE SAME RATE AS THE NOTES AND PAY VARIABLE INTEREST PAYMENTS BASED ON THE THREE-MONTH OR SIX-MONTH LONDON INTER BANK OFFERING RATE (LIBOR) PLUS A SPREAD. EACH SWAP HAS THE SAME NOTIONAL AMOUNT AND MATURITY DATE AS ITS RESPECTIVE NOTE. AFTER

ISSUANCE OF THESE NOTES, $410.0 MILLION REMAINS AVAILABLE TO BE ISSUED UNDER OUR MEDIUM NOTE PROGRAM, AND ANOTHER $500.0 MILLION REMAINS AVAILABLE TO BE ISSUED UNDER OUR SHELF REGISTRATION STATEMENT. WE MAY ISSUE ADDITIONAL NOTES UNDER THE SHELF

REGISTRATION IN FISCAL 2004 DEPENDING ON WORKING CAPITAL GENERAL CORPORATE NEEDS.

AS OF MAY 31, 2003, WE HAD A TOTAL OF $1.0 BILLION AVAILABLE UNDER TWO COMMITTED CREDIT FACILITIES IN PLACE WITH A GROUP OF BANKS, AND WE CURRENTLY HAVE NO AMOUNTS OUTSTANDING UNDER EITHER FACILITY. THE FIRST FACILITY

IS A $500.0 MILLION, 364-DAY FACILITY THAT WILL MATURE ON NOVEMBER 14, 2003 AND CAN BE EXTENDED 364 DAYS ON EACH MATURITY DATE. THE SECOND FACILITY IS A $500.0 MILLION, MULTI-YEAR FACILITY THAT MATURES ON NOVEMBER 17, 2005, AND ONCE A YEAR IT CAN BE

EXTENDED FOR ONE ADDITIONAL YEAR. BOTH OF THESE FACILITIES HAVE BEEN IN PLACE SINCE FISCAL 2001. DURING FISCAL 2003, UPON RENEWAL IN NOVEMBER 2002, THE 364-DAY FACILITY WAS REDUCED FROM $600.0 MILLION TO $500.0 MILLION. BASED ON OUR CURRENT

LONG-TERM SENIOR UNSECURED DEBT RATINGS OF A AND A2 FROM STANDARD AND POORS CORPORATION AND MOODYS INVESTOR SERVICES, RESPECTIVELY, THE INTEREST RATE CHARGED ON ANY OUTSTANDING BORROWINGS ON THE 364-DAY FACILITY WOULD BE THE PREVAILING

LIBOR PLUS 0.24%, AND THE INTEREST RATE CHARGED ON ANY OUTSTANDING BORROWINGS ON THE MULTI-YEAR FACILITY WOULD BE THE PREVAILING LIBOR PLUS 0.22%. THE FACILITY FEES FOR THE 364-DAY FACILITY AND THE MULTI-YEAR FACILITY ARE 0.06% AND 0.08%,

RESPECTIVELY, OF THE TOTAL COMMITMENT.

IF OUR LONG-TERM DEBT

RATING WERE TO DECLINE, THE FACILITY FEES AND INTEREST RATES UNDER OUR COMMITTED CREDIT FACILITIES WOULD INCREASE. CONVERSELY, IF OUR LONG-TERM DEBT RATING WERE TO IMPROVE, THE FACILITY FEES AND INTEREST

29

TABLE OF CONTENTS

RATES WOULD DECREASE. CHANGES IN OUR LONG-TERM DEBT RATING WOULD NOT TRIGGER ACCELERATION OF MATURITY OF ANY THEN OUTSTANDING BORROWINGS OR ANY FUTURE

BORROWINGS UNDER THE COMMITTED CREDIT FACILITIES. HOWEVER, UNDER THESE COMMITTED CREDIT FACILITIES, WE HAVE AGREED TO VARIOUS COVENANTS. THESE COVENANTS INCLUDE LIMITS ON OUR DISPOSAL OF FIXED ASSETS AND THE AMOUNT OF DEBT SECURED BY LIENS WE MAY

INCUR, AND SET A MINIMUM RATIO OF NET WORTH TO INDEBTEDNESS. IN THE EVENT WE WERE TO HAVE ANY BORROWINGS OUTSTANDING UNDER THESE FACILITIES, FAILED TO MEET ANY COVENANT, AND WERE UNABLE TO OBTAIN A WAIVER FROM A MAJORITY OF THE BANKS, ANY BORROWINGS

WOULD BECOME IMMEDIATELY DUE AND PAYABLE. AS OF MAY 31, 2003, WE WERE IN FULL COMPLIANCE WITH EACH OF THESE COVENANTS AND BELIEVE IT IS UNLIKELY WE WILL FAIL TO MEET ANY OF THESE COVENANTS IN THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE.

LIQUIDITY IS ALSO PROVIDED BY OUR COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAM, UNDER WHICH THERE

WAS NO AMOUNT OUTSTANDING AT MAY 31, 2003 AND $338.3 MILLION OUTSTANDING AT MAY 31, 2002. WE CURRENTLY HAVE SHORT-TERM DEBT RATINGS OF A1 AND P1 FROM STANDARD AND POORS CORPORATION AND MOODYS INVESTOR SERVICES, RESPECTIVELY.

WE CURRENTLY BELIEVE THAT CASH GENERATED BY OPERATIONS, TOGETHER WITH

ACCESS TO EXTERNAL SOURCES OF FUNDS AS DESCRIBED ABOVE, WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO MEET OUR OPERATING AND CAPITAL NEEDS IN THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE.

DIVIDENDS PER SHARE OF COMMON STOCK FOR FISCAL 2003 WERE $0.54, COMPARED TO $0.48 IN FISCAL 2002. WE HAVE PAID A DIVIDEND EVERY QUARTER SINCE FEBRUARY

1984. WE REVIEW OUR DIVIDEND POLICY FROM TIME TO TIME; HOWEVER, BASED UPON CURRENT PROJECTED EARNINGS AND CASH FLOW REQUIREMENTS, WE ANTICIPATE CONTINUING TO PAY A QUARTERLY DIVIDEND IN THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE.

ITEM 7A.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS AND CONSISTENT WITH ESTABLISHED POLICIES AND PROCEDURES, WE EMPLOY A VARIETY OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS TO MANAGE EXPOSURE

TO FLUCTUATIONS IN THE VALUE OF FOREIGN CURRENCIES AND INTEREST RATES. IT IS OUR POLICY TO UTILIZE THESE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS ONLY WHERE NECESSARY TO FINANCE OUR BUSINESS AND MANAGE SUCH EXPOSURES; WE DO NOT ENTER INTO THESE TRANSACTIONS FOR

SPECULATIVE PURPOSES.

WE ARE EXPOSED TO FOREIGN CURRENCY

FLUCTUATION AS A RESULT OF OUR INTERNATIONAL SALES, PRODUCTION AND FUNDING ACTIVITIES. OUR FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVE IS TO REDUCE THE VARIABILITY OF LOCAL ENTITY CASH FLOWS AS A RESULT OF EXCHANGE RATE MOVEMENTS. WE USE FORWARD

EXCHANGE CONTRACTS AND OPTIONS TO HEDGE CERTAIN ANTICIPATED BUT NOT YET FIRMLY COMMITTED TRANSACTIONS AS WELL AS CERTAIN FIRM COMMITMENTS AND THE RELATED RECEIVABLES AND PAYABLES, INCLUDING THIRD PARTY OR INTERCOMPANY TRANSACTIONS.

WHEN WE BEGIN HEDGING EXPOSURES DEPENDS ON THE NATURE OF THE EXPOSURE AND

MARKET CONDITIONS. GENERALLY, ALL ANTICIPATED AND FIRMLY COMMITTED TRANSACTIONS THAT ARE HEDGED ARE TO BE RECOGNIZED WITHIN TWELVE MONTHS, ALTHOUGH AT MAY 31, 2003 WE HAD FORWARD CONTRACTS HEDGING ANTICIPATED TRANSACTIONS THAT WILL BE RECOGNIZED IN

AS MANY AS 18 MONTHS. THE MAJORITY OF THE CONTRACTS EXPIRING IN MORE THAN TWELVE MONTHS RELATE TO THE ANTICIPATED PURCHASE OF INVENTORY BY OUR EUROPEAN AND JAPANESE SUBSIDIARIES. WE USE FORWARD CONTRACTS AND CROSS-CURRENCY SWAPS TO HEDGE FOREIGN

CURRENCY DENOMINATED PAYMENTS UNDER INTERCOMPANY LOAN AGREEMENTS. WHEN INTERCOMPANY LOANS ARE HEDGED, IT IS TYPICALLY FOR THEIR EXPECTED DURATION. HEDGED TRANSACTIONS ARE PRINCIPALLY DENOMINATED IN EUROPEAN CURRENCIES, JAPANESE YEN, CANADIAN

DOLLARS, KOREAN WON, MEXICAN PESOS AND AUSTRALIAN DOLLARS.

OUR

EARNINGS ARE ALSO EXPOSED TO MOVEMENTS IN SHORT AND LONG-TERM MARKET INTEREST RATES. OUR OBJECTIVE IN MANAGING THIS INTEREST RATE EXPOSURE IS TO LIMIT THE IMPACT OF INTEREST RATE CHANGES ON EARNINGS AND CASH FLOWS, AND TO REDUCE OVERALL BORROWING

COSTS. TO ACHIEVE THESE OBJECTIVES, WE MAINTAIN A MIX OF MEDIUM AND LONG-TERM FIXED RATE DEBT, COMMERCIAL PAPER, AND BANK LOANS AND HAVE ENTERED INTO INTEREST RATE SWAPS UNDER WHICH WE RECEIVE FIXED INTEREST AND PAY VARIABLE INTEREST.

MARKET RISK MEASUREMENT

WE MONITOR FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK, INTEREST RATE RISK AND RELATED DERIVATIVES USING A VARIETY OF TECHNIQUES INCLUDING A

REVIEW OF MARKET VALUE, SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS, AND VALUE-AT-RISK (VAR). OUR MARKET-SENSITIVE DERIVATIVE AND OTHER FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, AS DEFINED BY THE SEC, ARE FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS, FOREIGN CURRENCY OPTION CONTRACTS, CROSS-CURRENCY

SWAPS, INTEREST RATE SWAPS, INTERCOMPANY LOANS DENOMINATED IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES, FIXED INTEREST RATE U.S. DOLLAR DENOMINATED DEBT, AND FIXED INTEREST RATE JAPANESE YEN DENOMINATED DEBT.

30

TABLE OF CONTENTS

WE USE VAR TO MONITOR THE FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK OF OUR FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD AND FOREIGN CURRENCY

OPTION DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS ONLY. THE VAR DETERMINES THE MAXIMUM POTENTIAL ONE-DAY LOSS IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THESE FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATE-SENSITIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS. THE VAR MODEL ESTIMATES ASSUME NORMAL MARKET CONDITIONS AND A 95% CONFIDENCE

LEVEL. THERE ARE VARIOUS MODELING TECHNIQUES THAT CAN BE USED IN THE VAR COMPUTATION. OUR COMPUTATIONS ARE BASED ON INTERRELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN CURRENCIES AND INTEREST RATES (A VARIANCE/CO-VARIANCE TECHNIQUE). THESE INTERRELATIONSHIPS ARE

A FUNCTION OF FOREIGN EXCHANGE CURRENCY MARKET CHANGES AND INTEREST RATE CHANGES OVER THE PRECEDING ONE YEAR. THE VALUE OF FOREIGN CURRENCY OPTIONS DOES NOT CHANGE ON A ONE-TO-ONE BASIS WITH CHANGES IN THE UNDERLYING CURRENCY RATE. WE ADJUSTED THE

POTENTIAL LOSS IN OPTION VALUE FOR THE ESTIMATED SENSITIVITY (THE DELTA AND GAMMA) TO CHANGES IN THE UNDERLYING CURRENCY RATE. THIS CALCULATION REFLECTS THE IMPACT OF FOREIGN CURRENCY RATE FLUCTUATIONS ON THE DERIVATIVE

INSTRUMENTS ONLY, AND HENCE DOES NOT INCLUDE THE IMPACT OF SUCH RATE FLUCTUATIONS ON THE UNDERLYING BASED TRANSACTIONS THAT ARE ANTICIPATED TRANSACTIONS, FIRM COMMITMENTS, CASH BALANCES AND ACCOUNTS AND LOANS RECEIVABLE AND PAYABLE DENOMINATED IN

FOREIGN CURRENCIES FROM THE VAR CALCULATION, INCLUDING THOSE WHICH ARE HEDGED BY THESE INSTRUMENTS.

THE VAR MODEL IS A RISK ANALYSIS TOOL AND DOES NOT PURPORT TO REPRESENT ACTUAL LOSSES IN FAIR VALUE THAT WE WILL INCUR, NOR DOES IT CONSIDER THE POTENTIAL

EFFECT OF FAVORABLE CHANGES IN MARKET RATES. IT ALSO DOES NOT REPRESENT THE FULL EXTENT OF THE POSSIBLE LOSS THAT MAY OCCUR. ACTUAL FUTURE GAINS AND LOSSES WILL DIFFER FROM THOSE ESTIMATED BECAUSE OF CHANGES OR DIFFERENCES IN MARKET RATES AND

INTERRELATIONSHIPS, HEDGING INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGE PERCENTAGES, TIMING AND OTHER FACTORS.

THE ESTIMATED MAXIMUM ONE-DAY LOSS IN FAIR VALUE ON OUR FOREIGN CURRENCY SENSITIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, DERIVED USING THE VAR MODEL, WAS $21.0 MILLION AND $13.7 MILLION AT MAY 31, 2003 AND MAY 31, 2002,

RESPECTIVELY. THE INCREASE IN VAR AS OF MAY 31, 2003 OCCURRED DUE TO THE EFFECT OF CURRENCY VOLATILITY ON EXISTING TRADES ON THE MAY 31, 2003 VAR COMPUTATION VERSUS THE EFFECT OF CURRENCY VOLATILITY ON EXISTING TRADES ON THE MAY 31, 2002 VAR

COMPUTATION. SUCH A HYPOTHETICAL LOSS IN FAIR VALUE OF OUR DERIVATIVES WOULD BE OFFSET BY INCREASES IN THE VALUE OF THE UNDERLYING TRANSACTIONS BEING HEDGED. THE AVERAGE MONTHLY CHANGE IN THE FAIR VALUES OF FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD AND FOREIGN

CURRENCY OPTION DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS WAS $43.3 MILLION AND $42.9 MILLION FOR FISCAL 2003 AND FISCAL 2002, RESPECTIVELY.

DETAILS OF OTHER MARKET-SENSITIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS NOT INCLUDED IN THE VAR CALCULATION ABOVE ARE PROVIDED IN THE

TABLE BELOW, EXCEPT THE INTEREST RATE SWAPS WHICH ARE DESCRIBED BELOW. THESE INSTRUMENTS INCLUDE INTERCOMPANY LOANS DENOMINATED IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES, FIXED INTEREST RATE JAPANESE YEN DENOMINATED DEBT, FIXED INTEREST RATE U.S. DOLLAR DENOMINATED

DEBT, CROSS-CURRENCY SWAPS, AND INTEREST RATE SWAPS. FOR DEBT OBLIGATIONS, THE TABLE PRESENTS PRINCIPAL CASH FLOWS AND RELATED WEIGHTED AVERAGE INTEREST RATES BY EXPECTED MATURITY DATES. WE HAVE EXCLUDED THE CROSS-CURRENCY SWAPS FROM THE FOREIGN

EXCHANGE RISK CATEGORY BECAUSE THESE INSTRUMENTS ELIMINATE ALL FOREIGN CURRENCY EXPOSURE IN THE CASH FLOWS OF A EURO DENOMINATED INTERCOMPANY LOAN. WE HAVE INCLUDED THESE CROSS-CURRENCY SWAPS IN THE INTEREST RATE RISK CATEGORY BUT EXCLUDED THE

RELATED INTERCOMPANY LOAN FROM THIS CATEGORY BECAUSE THE INTERCOMPANY INTEREST ELIMINATES IN CONSOLIDATION. FOR THE CROSS-CURRENCY SWAPS THE TABLE PRESENTS BOTH THE EURO SWAP PAYABLE AND U.S. DOLLAR SWAP RECEIVABLE AND THE RESPECTIVE PAY AND RECEIVE

INTEREST RATES. ALL INFORMATION IS PRESENTED IN MILLIONS OF U.S. DOLLARS, EXCEPT INTEREST RATES.

INTERCOMPANY LOANS AND RELATED INTEREST AMOUNTS ELIMINATE IN CONSOLIDATION. INTERCOMPANY LOANS ARE GENERALLY HEDGED AGAINST FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK THROUGH

THE USE OF FORWARD CONTRACTS AND SWAPS WITH THIRD PARTIES.

THE

FIXED INTEREST RATE JAPANESE YEN DENOMINATED DEBTS WERE ISSUED BY AND ARE ACCOUNTED FOR BY TWO OF OUR JAPANESE SUBSIDIARIES. ACCORDINGLY, THE MONTHLY REMEASUREMENT OF THESE INSTRUMENTS DUE TO CHANGES IN FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES IS RECOGNIZED IN

ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE LOSS UPON THE CONSOLIDATION OF THESE SUBSIDIARIES.

THERE WERE NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN DEBT OR CROSS-CURRENCY SWAP MARKET RISKS DURING FISCAL 2003. THE U.S. DOLLAR FAIR VALUES OF INTERCOMPANY LOANS DENOMINATED IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES WAS $649.4 MILLION AT MAY 31, 2002,

WHICH IS THE SAME AS THE CARRYING VALUES OF THE LOANS PRIOR TO THEIR ELIMINATION. THE U.S. DOLLAR FAIR VALUE OF THE FIXED RATE JAPANESE YEN DENOMINATED DEBT THAT WAS OUTSTANDING AT MAY 31, 2002 WAS $207.4 MILLION VERSUS A CARRYING VALUE OF $181.4

MILLION AT THAT DATE. THE U.S. DOLLAR FAIR VALUES OF THE FIXED RATE U.S. DOLLAR DENOMINATED DEBT, THE EURO SWAP PAYABLE AND THE U.S. DOLLAR SWAP RECEIVABLE AS OF MAY 31, 2002 WERE $516.5 MILLION, $196.2 MILLION AND $267.9 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY,

VERSUS CARRYING VALUES OF $499.8 MILLION, $188.8 MILLION AND $250.0 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, AT THAT DATE.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

IN FISCAL 2002 WE ISSUED A $250 MILLION LONG-TERM FIXED-RATE CORPORATE BOND WHICH MATURES IN AUGUST 2006.

IN FISCAL 2003, WE ISSUED AN ADDITIONAL $90 MILLION IN LONG-TERM FIXED-RATE CORPORATE BONDS WHICH MATURE ON VARIOUS DATES BEGINNING IN JULY 2007 THROUGH AUGUST 2012. FIXED INTEREST RATES ON THESE BONDS RANGE FROM 4.8% TO 5.66%. FOR EACH OF THESE

BONDS ISSUED IN FISCAL 2002 AND FISCAL 2003, WE HAVE ENTERED INTO INTEREST RATE SWAP AGREEMENTS WHEREBY WE RECEIVE FIXED INTEREST PAYMENTS AT THE SAME RATE AS THE BONDS AND PAY VARIABLE INTEREST PAYMENTS BASED ON THE THREE-MONTH OR SIX-MONTH LIBOR

PLUS A SPREAD. EACH SWAP HAS THE SAME NOTIONAL AMOUNT AND MATURITY DATE AS THE CORRESPONDING BOND. AS A RESULT OF THE INTEREST RATE SWAP AGREEMENTS, THE AVERAGE EFFECTIVE INTEREST RATE PAYABLE ON THESE BONDS WAS 2.5% AT MAY 31, 2003 AND 3.3% AT MAY

31, 2002. THESE INTEREST RATE SWAPS ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AS FAIR VALUE HEDGES, SO CHANGES IN THE RECORDED FAIR VALUES OF THE SWAPS ARE OFFSET BY CHANGES IN THE RECORDED FAIR VALUE OF THE RELATED DEBT. THE RECORDED FAIR VALUE OF THE INTEREST RATE SWAPS

WAS A $25.5 MILLION GAIN AT MAY 31, 2003 AND A $1.8 MILLION LOSS AT MAY 31, 2002.

IN FISCAL 2003 WE ALSO ENTERED INTO AN INTEREST RATE SWAP AGREEMENT RELATED TO A JAPANESE YEN DENOMINATED INTERCOMPANY LOAN WITH ONE OF OUR JAPANESE SUBSIDIARIES. THE JAPANESE SUBSIDIARY PAYS VARIABLE INTEREST ON THE

INTERCOMPANY LOAN BASED ON 3-MONTH LIBOR PLUS A SPREAD. UNDER THE INTEREST RATE SWAP AGREEMENT, THE SUBSIDIARY PAYS FIXED INTEREST PAYMENTS AT 0.8% AND RECEIVES VARIABLE INTEREST PAYMENTS BASED ON 3-MONTH LIBOR PLUS A SPREAD BASED ON A NOTIONAL

AMOUNT OF 8 BILLION JAPANESE YEN. THIS INTEREST RATE SWAP IS NOT ACCOUNTED FOR AS A HEDGE, ACCORDINGLY CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE SWAP ARE RECORDED TO NET INCOME. AS OF MAY 31, 2003, THE RECORDED FAIR VALUE OF THE SWAP WAS A $1.0 MILLION LOSS.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 1  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

BASIS OF CONSOLIDATION

THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDE THE ACCOUNTS OF NIKE, INC. AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES (THE COMPANY). ALL SIGNIFICANT

INTERCOMPANY TRANSACTIONS AND BALANCES HAVE BEEN ELIMINATED.

RECOGNITION OF REVENUES

WHOLESALE

REVENUES ARE RECOGNIZED WHEN TITLE PASSES AND THE RISKS AND REWARDS OF OWNERSHIP HAVE PASSED TO THE CUSTOMER, BASED ON THE TERMS OF SALE. TITLE PASSES GENERALLY UPON SHIPMENT OR UPON RECEIPT BY THE CUSTOMER DEPENDING ON THE COUNTRY OF THE SALE AND

THE AGREEMENT WITH THE CUSTOMER. RETAIL STORE REVENUES ARE RECORDED AT THE TIME OF SALE. PROVISIONS FOR SALES DISCOUNTS AND RETURNS ARE MADE AT THE TIME OF SALE.

SHIPPING AND HANDLING COSTS

SHIPPING AND HANDLING COSTS ARE EXPENSED AS INCURRED AND INCLUDED IN COST OF SALES.

ADVERTISING AND PROMOTION

ADVERTISING PRODUCTION COSTS ARE EXPENSED THE FIRST TIME THE ADVERTISEMENT

IS RUN. MEDIA (TV AND PRINT) PLACEMENT COSTS ARE EXPENSED IN THE MONTH THE ADVERTISING APPEARS. A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF THE COMPANYS PROMOTIONAL EXPENSES RESULT FROM PAYMENTS UNDER ENDORSEMENT CONTRACTS. ACCOUNTING FOR ENDORSEMENT PAYMENTS IS

BASED UPON SPECIFIC CONTRACT PROVISIONS. GENERALLY, ENDORSEMENT PAYMENTS ARE EXPENSED UNIFORMLY OVER THE TERM OF THE CONTRACT AFTER GIVING RECOGNITION TO PERIODIC PERFORMANCE COMPLIANCE PROVISIONS OF THE CONTRACTS. PREPAYMENTS MADE UNDER CONTRACTS

ARE INCLUDED IN PREPAID EXPENSES AND OTHER CURRENT ASSETS OR OTHER ASSETS DEPENDING ON THE LENGTH OF THE CONTRACT. THROUGH COOPERATIVE ADVERTISING PROGRAMS, WE REIMBURSE OUR RETAIL CUSTOMERS FOR CERTAIN OF THEIR COSTS OF ADVERTISING OUR PRODUCTS. WE

RECORD THESE COSTS IN SELLING AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE AT THE POINT IN TIME WHEN WE ARE OBLIGATED TO OUR CUSTOMERS FOR THE COSTS. THIS OBLIGATION MAY ARISE PRIOR TO THE RELATED ADVERTISEMENT BEING RUN. TOTAL ADVERTISING AND PROMOTION EXPENSES WERE

$1,168.6 MILLION, $1,027.9 MILLION AND $998.2 MILLION FOR THE YEARS ENDED MAY 31, 2003, 2002 AND 2001, RESPECTIVELY. INCLUDED IN PREPAID EXPENSES AND OTHER CURRENT ASSETS AND OTHER ASSETS WAS $135.2 MILLION AND $113.2 MILLION AT MAY 31, 2003 AND

2002, RESPECTIVELY, RELATING TO PREPAID ADVERTISING AND PROMOTION EXPENSES.

CASH AND EQUIVALENTS

CASH AND EQUIVALENTS REPRESENT CASH AND SHORT-TERM, HIGHLY LIQUID INVESTMENTS WITH ORIGINAL MATURITIES OF THREE MONTHS OR LESS. THE CARRYING AMOUNTS REFLECTED IN THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET FOR CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS APPROXIMATE FAIR

VALUE DUE TO THE SHORT MATURITIES.

INVENTORY VALUATION

INVENTORIES ARE STATED AT THE LOWER OF COST OR

MARKET. INVENTORIES ARE VALUED ON A FIRST-IN, FIRST-OUT (FIFO) OR MOVING-AVERAGE COST BASIS.

PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT AND DEPRECIATION

PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT ARE RECORDED AT COST. DEPRECIATION FOR FINANCIAL REPORTING PURPOSES IS DETERMINED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS FOR BUILDINGS AND LEASEHOLD IMPROVEMENTS OVER 2 TO 40 YEARS AND PRINCIPALLY ON A

DECLINING BALANCE BASIS FOR MACHINERY AND EQUIPMENT OVER 2 TO 15 YEARS. COMPUTER SOFTWARE IS DEPRECIATED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER 3 TO 10 YEARS.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (CONTINUED)

IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS

EFFECTIVE JUNE 1, 2002, THE COMPANY ADOPTED THE PROVISIONS OF STATEMENT OF

FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS (SFAS) NO. 144, ACCOUNTING FOR THE IMPAIRMENT OR DISPOSAL OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS (FAS 144), WHICH DID NOT HAVE AN IMPACT ON THE COMPANYS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL POSITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. IN

ACCORDANCE WITH FAS 144, THE COMPANY ESTIMATES THE FUTURE UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS TO BE DERIVED FROM AN ASSET TO ASSESS WHETHER OR NOT A POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT EXISTS WHEN EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THE CARRYING VALUE OF A LONG-LIVED ASSET MAY

BE IMPAIRED. IF THE CARRYING VALUE EXCEEDS OUR ESTIMATE OF FUTURE UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS, WE THEN CALCULATE THE IMPAIRMENT AS THE EXCESS OF THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE ASSET OVER OUR ESTIMATE OF ITS FAIR MARKET VALUE.

IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND GOODWILL

IN ACCORDANCE WITH SFAS NO. 142 GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE

ASSETS (FAS 142), GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS WITH INDEFINITE LIVES ARE NO LONGER BEING AMORTIZED BUT INSTEAD ARE BEING MEASURED FOR IMPAIRMENT AT LEAST ANNUALLY, OR WHEN EVENTS INDICATE THAT AN IMPAIRMENT EXISTS. AS REQUIRED BY FAS 142, IN

THE COMPANYS IMPAIRMENT TEST OF GOODWILL, WE COMPARE THE FAIR VALUE OF THE APPLICABLE REPORTING UNIT TO ITS CARRYING VALUE. IF THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE REPORTING UNIT EXCEEDS THE ESTIMATE OF FAIR VALUE, WE CALCULATE THE IMPAIRMENT AS THE

EXCESS OF THE CARRYING VALUE OF GOODWILL OVER ITS IMPLIED FAIR VALUE. IN THE IMPAIRMENT TESTS FOR INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS, WE COMPARE THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF THE INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS TO THE CARRYING VALUE. IF THE

CARRYING VALUE EXCEEDS THE ESTIMATE OF FAIR VALUE, WE CALCULATE IMPAIRMENT AS THE EXCESS OF THE CARRYING VALUE OVER THE ESTIMATE OF FAIR VALUE. SEE NOTE 4 FOR DISCUSSION OF THE COMPANYS ADOPTION OF FAS 142.

INTANGIBLE ASSETS THAT ARE DETERMINED TO HAVE DEFINITE LIVES ARE AMORTIZED

OVER THEIR USEFUL LIVES AND ARE MEASURED FOR IMPAIRMENT ONLY WHEN EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THE CARRYING VALUE MAY BE IMPAIRED IN ACCORDANCE WITH FAS 144 DISCUSSED ABOVE.

FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION AND FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSACTIONS

ADJUSTMENTS RESULTING FROM TRANSLATING FOREIGN FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS INTO U.S. DOLLARS ARE INCLUDED IN THE FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENT, A COMPONENT OF ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE LOSS IN SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY.

TRANSACTION GAINS AND LOSSES GENERATED BY THE EFFECT OF FOREIGN EXCHANGE ON RECORDED ASSETS AND LIABILITIES DENOMINATED IN A

CURRENCY DIFFERENT FROM THE FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY OF THE APPLICABLE COMPANY ENTITY ARE RECORDED IN OTHER INCOME/EXPENSE CURRENTLY.

ACCOUNTING FOR DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES

THE COMPANY USES DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS TO LIMIT EXPOSURE TO CHANGES IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES AND INTEREST RATES. THE COMPANY

ACCOUNTS FOR DERIVATIVES PURSUANT TO SFAS NO. 133, ACCOUNTING FOR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES, AS AMENDED AND INTERPRETED (FAS 133), WHICH WAS ADOPTED ON JUNE 1, 2001. FAS 133 ESTABLISHES ACCOUNTING AND REPORTING

STANDARDS FOR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND REQUIRES THAT ALL DERIVATIVES BE RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE ON THE BALANCE SHEET. CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS ARE EITHER RECOGNIZED IN OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (A COMPONENT OF

SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY) OR NET INCOME DEPENDING ON WHETHER THE DERIVATIVE IS BEING USED TO HEDGE CHANGES IN CASH FLOWS OR FAIR VALUE.

IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE TRANSITION PROVISIONS, THE COMPANY RECORDED A ONE-TIME TRANSITION ADJUSTMENT AS OF JUNE 1, 2001 ON BOTH THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT

OF INCOME AND THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET. THE TRANSITION

41

TABLE OF CONTENTS

NIKE, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (CONTINUED)

ADJUSTMENT ON THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF INCOME WAS A CHARGE OF $5.0 MILLION, NET OF TAX EFFECT. THIS AMOUNT RELATED TO AN INVESTMENT THAT WAS ADJUSTED TO

FAIR VALUE IN ACCORDANCE WITH FAS 133. THE TRANSITION ADJUSTMENT ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET REPRESENTED THE INITIAL RECOGNITION OF THE FAIR VALUES OF HEDGE DERIVATIVES OUTSTANDING ON THE ADOPTION DATE AND REALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES ON

EFFECTIVE HEDGES FOR WHICH THE UNDERLYING EXPOSURE HAD NOT YET AFFECTED EARNINGS. THE TRANSITION ADJUSTMENT ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET WAS AN INCREASE IN CURRENT ASSETS OF $116.4 MILLION, AN INCREASE IN NONCURRENT ASSETS OF $87.0 MILLION, AN

INCREASE IN CURRENT LIABILITIES OF $151.6 MILLION, AND AN INCREASE IN OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME OF APPROXIMATELY $56.8 MILLION, NET OF TAX EFFECT. THE MAJORITY OF THE $56.8 MILLION RECORDED IN OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME AS OF JUNE 1, 2001

RELATED TO OUTSTANDING DERIVATIVES AT THAT DATE. BECAUSE EXCHANGE RATES ON THE TRANSITION DATE WERE DIFFERENT FROM THOSE ON THE MATURITY DATES OF THESE DERIVATIVES AND BECAUSE SOME CONTRACTS MATURING DURING THE YEAR ENDED MAY 31, 2002 WERE ENTERED

INTO AFTER THE TRANSITION DATE, AMOUNTS ULTIMATELY RECLASSIFIED TO EARNINGS DURING THE YEAR ENDED MAY 31, 2002, AS DESCRIBED IN NOTE 14, WERE SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT FROM THIS AMOUNT.

UNREALIZED DERIVATIVE GAINS AND LOSSES RECORDED IN CURRENT AND NON-CURRENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AND AMOUNTS RECORDED IN

OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME ARE NON-CASH ITEMS AND THEREFORE ARE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT IN THE PREPARATION OF THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS BASED ON THEIR RESPECTIVE BALANCE SHEET CLASSIFICATIONS.

SEE NOTE 16 FOR MORE INFORMATION ON OUR RISK MANAGEMENT PROGRAM AND

DERIVATIVES.

STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION

THE COMPANY USES THE INTRINSIC VALUE METHOD TO

ACCOUNT FOR STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION IN ACCORDANCE WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES BOARD (APB) OPINION NO. 25, ACCOUNTING FOR STOCK ISSUED TO EMPLOYEES AS PERMITTED BY STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS (SFAS) NO. 123

ACCOUNTING FOR STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION (FAS 123). THE COMPANYS POLICY IS TO GRANT STOCK OPTIONS WITH AN EXERCISE PRICE EQUAL TO THE MARKET VALUE AT THE DATE OF GRANT, AND ACCORDINGLY, NO COMPENSATION EXPENSE IS RECOGNIZED.

AS REQUIRED BY FAS 123 AND AMENDED BY SFAS NO. 148

ACCOUNTING FOR STOCK-BASED COMPENSATIONTRANSITION AND DISCLOSURE (FAS 148), THE COMPANY HAS COMPUTED, FOR PRO FORMA DISCLOSURE PURPOSES, THE FAIR VALUE OF OPTIONS GRANTED DURING THE YEARS ENDED MAY 31, 2003, 2002 AND 2001 USING THE

BLACK-SCHOLES OPTION PRICING MODEL. THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE ASSUMPTIONS USED FOR STOCK OPTION GRANTS FOR EACH OF THESE YEARS WERE A DIVIDEND YIELD OF 1%, EXPECTED VOLATILITY OF THE MARKET PRICE OF THE COMPANYS COMMON STOCK OF 38%, 38% AND 39% FOR

THE YEARS ENDED MAY 31, 2003, 2002 AND 2001, RESPECTIVELY; A WEIGHTED-AVERAGE EXPECTED LIFE OF THE OPTIONS OF APPROXIMATELY FIVE YEARS; AND INTEREST RATES OF 3.8%, 4.8% AND 5.4% FOR THE YEARS ENDED MAY 31, 2003, 2002 AND 2001, RESPECTIVELY. THESE

INTEREST RATES ARE REFLECTIVE OF OPTION GRANT DATES THROUGHOUT THE YEAR.

OPTIONS WERE ASSUMED TO BE EXERCISED OVER THE 5 YEAR EXPECTED LIFE FOR PURPOSES OF THIS VALUATION. ADJUSTMENTS FOR FORFEITURES ARE MADE AS THEY OCCUR. FOR THE YEARS ENDED MAY 31, 2003, 2002 AND 2001, THE TOTAL VALUE

OF THE OPTIONS GRANTED, FOR WHICH NO PREVIOUS EXPENSE HAS BEEN RECOGNIZED, WAS COMPUTED AS APPROXIMATELY $89.8 MILLION, $73.4 MILLION AND $5.0 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, WHICH WOULD BE AMORTIZED ON A STRAIGHT LINE BASIS OVER THE VESTING PERIOD OF THE

OPTIONS. THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE FAIR VALUE PER SHARE OF THE OPTIONS GRANTED IN THE YEARS ENDED MAY 31, 2003, 2002 AND 2001 ARE $17.45, $16.02 AND $17.27, RESPECTIVELY.

THE PRO FORMA EFFECTS

OF APPLYING FAS 123 MAY NOT BE REPRESENTATIVE OF THE EFFECTS ON REPORTED NET INCOME AND EARNINGS PER SHARE FOR FUTURE YEARS SINCE OPTIONS VEST OVER SEVERAL YEARS AND ADDITIONAL AWARDS ARE MADE EACH YEAR.

INCOME TAXES

UNITED STATES INCOME TAXES ARE PROVIDED CURRENTLY ON FINANCIAL STATEMENT

EARNINGS OF NON-U.S. SUBSIDIARIES EXPECTED TO BE REPATRIATED. THE COMPANY DETERMINES ANNUALLY THE AMOUNT OF UNDISTRIBUTED NON-U.S. EARNINGS TO INVEST INDEFINITELY IN ITS NON-U.S. OPERATIONS. THE COMPANY ACCOUNTS FOR INCOME TAXES USING THE ASSET AND

LIABILITY METHOD. THIS APPROACH REQUIRES THE RECOGNITION OF DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES FOR THE EXPECTED FUTURE TAX CONSEQUENCES OF TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE CARRYING AMOUNTS AND THE TAX BASES OF OTHER ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. SEE

NOTE 8 FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION.

EARNINGS PER SHARE

BASIC EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE IS CALCULATED BY

DIVIDING NET INCOME BY THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE NUMBER OF COMMON SHARES OUTSTANDING DURING THE YEAR. DILUTED EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE IS CALCULATED BY ADJUSTING WEIGHTED AVERAGE OUTSTANDING SHARES, ASSUMING CONVERSION OF ALL POTENTIALLY DILUTIVE STOCK

OPTIONS AND AWARDS. SEE NOTE 11 FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION.

MANAGEMENT ESTIMATES

THE PREPARATION

OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN CONFORMITY WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO MAKE ESTIMATES, INCLUDING ESTIMATES RELATING TO ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AND DISCLOSURE OF

CONTINGENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AT THE DATE OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF REVENUES AND EXPENSES DURING THE REPORTING PERIOD. ACTUAL RESULTS COULD DIFFER FROM THESE ESTIMATES.

RECLASSIFICATIONS

CERTAIN PRIOR YEAR AMOUNTS HAVE BEEN RECLASSIFIED TO CONFORM TO FISCAL YEAR 2003 PRESENTATION. THESE CHANGES HAD NO IMPACT

ON PREVIOUSLY REPORTED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY.

RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

IN JUNE 2001, THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD (FASB) ISSUED SFAS NO. 143, ACCOUNTING FOR ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS (FAS 143). THIS STATEMENT REQUIRES THAT A LIABILITY FOR AN ASSET RETIREMENT

OBLIGATION BE RECOGNIZED AT FAIR VALUE IN THE PERIOD THE OBLIGATION IS INCURRED AND THE ASSOCIATED RETIREMENT COSTS BE CAPITALIZED AS PART OF THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF THE RELATED TANGIBLE LONG-LIVED ASSET. ALL PROVISIONS OF THIS STATEMENT WILL BE

EFFECTIVE FOR THE COMPANY ON JUNE 1, 2003. IT IS NOT EXPECTED THAT THE ADOPTION OF FAS 143 WILL HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE COMPANYS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL POSITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

IN JUNE 2002, THE FASB ISSUED SFAS NO. 146 ACCOUNTING FOR COSTS

ASSOCIATED WITH EXIT OR DISPOSAL ACTIVITIES (FAS 146). THIS STATEMENT SUPERCEDES EMERGING ISSUES TASK FORCE (EITF) ISSUE NO. 94-3 LIABILITY RECOGNITION FOR CERTAIN EMPLOYEE TERMINATION BENEFITS AND OTHER COSTS TO EXIT AN ACTIVITY

(INCLUDING CERTAIN COSTS INCURRED IN A RESTRUCTURING). FAS 146 REQUIRES THAT A LIABILITY FOR A COST ASSOCIATED WITH AN EXIT OR DISPOSAL ACTIVITY BE RECOGNIZED WHEN THE LIABILITY IS INCURRED. UNDER EITF 94-3, A LIABILITY WAS RECOGNIZED AT THE

DATE AN ENTITY COMMITTED TO AN EXIT PLAN. FAS 146 ALSO ESTABLISHES THAT THE LIABILITY SHOULD INITIALLY BE MEASURED AND RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE. THE PROVISIONS OF FAS 146 ARE EFFECTIVE FOR ANY EXIT AND DISPOSAL ACTIVITIES INITIATED AFTER DECEMBER 31,

2002. WE HAVE NOT ENTERED INTO ANY SIGNIFICANT EXIT OR DISPOSAL ACTIVITIES SINCE THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF THIS RULE. AS SUCH, FAS 146 HAS NOT HAD ANY IMPACT ON THE COMPANYS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL POSITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, AND NO

SIGNIFICANT IMPACT IS EXPECTED IN THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE.

IN

NOVEMBER 2002, THE FASB ISSUED FASB INTERPRETATION NO. 45, GUARANTORS ACCOUNTING AND DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS FOR GUARANTEES, INCLUDING INDIRECT GUARANTEES OF INDEBTEDNESS OF OTHERS (FIN 45). FIN 45 REQUIRES THAT UPON ISSUANCE OF A

GUARANTEE, A GUARANTOR MUST RECOGNIZE A LIABILITY FOR THE FAIR VALUE OF AN OBLIGATION ASSUMED UNDER A GUARANTEE. FIN 45 ALSO REQUIRES ADDITIONAL DISCLOSURES BY A GUARANTOR IN ITS INTERIM AND ANNUAL FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ABOUT THE OBLIGATIONS

ASSOCIATED WITH GUARANTEES ISSUED. THE RECOGNITION PROVISIONS OF FIN 45 ARE EFFECTIVE FOR ANY GUARANTEES ISSUED OR MODIFIED AFTER DECEMBER 31, 2002. THE DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS OF FIN 45 WERE EFFECTIVE BEGINNING WITH THE THIRD QUARTER ENDED FEBRUARY

28, 2003.

IN CONNECTION WITH VARIOUS CONTRACTS AND AGREEMENTS,

THE COMPANY PROVIDES ROUTINE INDEMNIFICATIONS RELATING TO THE ENFORCEABILITY OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS, COVERAGE FOR LEGAL ISSUES THAT ARISE, AND OTHER ITEMS THAT FALL UNDER THE SCOPE OF FIN 45. CURRENTLY, THE COMPANY HAS SEVERAL SUCH

AGREEMENTS IN PLACE. HOWEVER, BASED ON THE COMPANYS HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND ESTIMATED PROBABILITY OF FUTURE LOSS, THE COMPANY HAS DETERMINED THAT THE FAIR VALUE OF SUCH INDEMNIFICATIONS IS NOT MATERIAL. HENCE, THE ADOPTION OF FIN 45 HAS NOT

HAD AN IMPACT ON THE COMPANYS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL POSITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, AND NO SIGNIFICANT IMPACT IS EXPECTED IN THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE.

IN DECEMBER 2002, THE FASB ISSUED SFAS NO. 148 ACCOUNTING FOR STOCK-BASED COMPENSATIONTRANSITION AND DISCLOSUREAN AMENDMENT OF FASB

STATEMENT NO. 123 (FAS 148). THIS STATEMENT AMENDS SFAS NO. 123 ACCOUNTING FOR STOCK BASED COMPENSATION (FAS 123) TO PROVIDE ALTERNATIVE METHODS OF VOLUNTARILY TRANSITIONING TO THE FAIR VALUE BASED METHOD OF ACCOUNTING FOR

STOCK-BASED EMPLOYEE COMPENSATION. FAS 148 ALSO AMENDS THE DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS OF FAS 123 TO REQUIRE DISCLOSURE OF THE METHOD USED TO ACCOUNT FOR STOCK-BASED EMPLOYEE COMPENSATION AND THE EFFECT OF THE METHOD ON REPORTED RESULTS IN BOTH ANNUAL

AND INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. THE DISCLOSURE PROVISIONS ARE EFFECTIVE FOR THE COMPANY BEGINNING WITH THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K. THE ANNUAL IMPACT OF A CHANGE TO THE FAIR VALUE MODEL PRESCRIBED BY FAS 123 HAS

BEEN DISCLOSED IN THE COMPANYS PREVIOUS ANNUAL 10-K FILINGS, AND THE APPLICABLE DISCLOSURES IN THIS REPORT ARE HERE IN NOTE 1 AND NOTE 10. AT THIS

TIME, THE COMPANY PLANS TO CONTINUE TO ACCOUNT FOR STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION USING THE INTRINSIC VALUE METHOD PRESCRIBED IN ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES BOARD OPINION NO. 25, ACCOUNTING FOR STOCK ISSUED TO EMPLOYEES, RATHER THAN CHANGE TO THE

FAS 123 FAIR VALUE METHOD.

IN JANUARY 2003, THE FASB ISSUED

FASB INTERPRETATION NO. 46, CONSOLIDATION OF VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES (FIN 46). THIS INTERPRETATION OF ACCOUNTING RESEARCH BULLETIN NO. 51, CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, ADDRESSES CONSOLIDATION OF VARIABLE INTEREST

ENTITIES. FIN 46 REQUIRES CERTAIN VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES TO BE CONSOLIDATED BY THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY IF THE ENTITY DOES NOT EFFECTIVELY DISPERSE RISKS AMONG THE PARTIES INVOLVED. THE PROVISIONS OF FIN 46 ARE EFFECTIVE IMMEDIATELY FOR THOSE

VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES CREATED AFTER JANUARY 31, 2003. THE PROVISIONS ARE EFFECTIVE FOR THE FIRST PERIOD BEGINNING AFTER JUNE 15, 2003 FOR THOSE VARIABLE INTERESTS HELD PRIOR TO FEBRUARY 1, 2003. THE COMPANY DOES NOT CURRENTLY HAVE ANY VARIABLE

INTEREST ENTITIES AS DEFINED IN FIN 46. ACCORDINGLY, THE COMPANY DOES NOT EXPECT THE PROVISIONS OF FIN 46 TO AFFECT THE COMPANYS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL POSITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

NOTE 4  IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND GOODWILL.

ADOPTION OF FAS 142

THE COMPANY ADOPTED STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS NO. 142,

GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS, (FAS 142) EFFECTIVE JUNE 1, 2002. IN ACCORDANCE WITH FAS 142, GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS WITH INDEFINITE LIVES WILL NO LONGER BE AMORTIZED BUT INSTEAD WILL BE MEASURED FOR IMPAIRMENT AT LEAST

ANNUALLY, OR WHEN EVENTS INDICATE THAT AN IMPAIRMENT EXISTS. INTANGIBLE ASSETS THAT ARE DETERMINED TO HAVE DEFINITE LIVES WILL CONTINUE TO BE AMORTIZED OVER THEIR USEFUL LIVES.

AS REQUIRED BY FAS 142, THE COMPANY PERFORMED IMPAIRMENT TESTS ON GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS WITH INDEFINITE

LIVES, WHICH CONSISTED ONLY OF CERTAIN TRADEMARKS, AS OF JUNE 1, 2002. AS A RESULT OF THE IMPAIRMENT TESTS, THE COMPANY RECORDED A $266.1 MILLION CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF ACCOUNTING CHANGE. UNDER FAS 142, GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT EXISTS IF THE NET BOOK

VALUE OF A REPORTING UNIT EXCEEDS ITS ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE. THE COMPANY ESTIMATED THE FAIR VALUE OF ITS REPORTING UNITS BY USING A COMBINATION OF DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW ANALYSES AND COMPARISONS WITH THE MARKET VALUES OF SIMILAR PUBLICLY-TRADED

COMPANIES.

INCLUDED IN THE COMPANYS $266.1 MILLION

IMPAIRMENT CHARGE WAS A $178.5 MILLION CHARGE RELATED TO THE IMPAIRMENT OF THE GOODWILL ASSOCIATED WITH THE BAUER NIKE HOCKEY (BAUER) AND COLE HAAN REPORTING UNITS. THESE REPORTING UNITS ARE REFLECTED IN THE COMPANYS

OTHER OPERATING SEGMENT. SINCE THE COMPANYS PURCHASE OF BAUER IN 1995, THE HOCKEY EQUIPMENT AND APPAREL MARKETS HAVE NOT GROWN AS FAST AS EXPECTED AND THE IN-LINE SKATE MARKET HAS CONTRACTED SIGNIFICANTLY. AS A RESULT, WE

DETERMINED THAT THE GOODWILL ACQUIRED AT BAUER HAD BEEN IMPAIRED. THE GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT AT COLE HAAN REFLECTED THE SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER FAIR VALUE CALCULATED ON THE BASIS OF REDUCED OPERATING INCOME IN THE YEAR FOLLOWING THE SEPTEMBER 11, 2001

TERRORIST ATTACKS.

THE REMAINING $87.6 MILLION OF THE

IMPAIRMENT CHARGE RELATES TO TRADEMARKS ASSOCIATED WITH BAUER. UNDER FAS 142, IMPAIRMENT OF AN INDEFINITE-LIVED ASSET EXISTS IF THE NET BOOK VALUE OF THE ASSET EXCEEDS ITS FAIR VALUE. THE COMPANY ESTIMATED THE FAIR VALUE OF TRADEMARKS USING THE

RELIEF-FROM-ROYALTY APPROACH, WHICH IS A STANDARD FORM OF DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW ANALYSIS TYPICALLY USED FOR THE VALUATION OF TRADEMARKS. THE IMPAIRMENT OF THE BAUER TRADEMARKS REFLECTS THE SAME CIRCUMSTANCES AS DESCRIBED ABOVE RELATED TO THE BAUER

GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT.

THE RESULTS FOR THE YEARS ENDED MAY 31, 2002 AND 2001 DO NOT REFLECT THE PROVISIONS OF FAS 142. THE REPORTED NET INCOME BEFORE CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF

ACCOUNTING CHANGE WAS $668.3 MILLION AND $589.7 MILLION FOR THE YEARS ENDED MAY 31, 2002 AND 2001, RESPECTIVELY. HAD THE COMPANY ADOPTED FAS 142 ON JUNE 1, 2000, FOR THE YEAR ENDED MAY 31, 2001 WE WOULD HAVE RECORDED NET INCOME BEFORE CUMULATIVE

EFFECT OF ACCOUNTING CHANGE OF $602.8 MILLION AS A RESULT OF NOT RECORDING $8.6 MILLION IN GOODWILL AMORTIZATION AND $4.5 MILLION IN TRADEMARK AMORTIZATION. FOR THE YEAR ENDED MAY 31, 2002, NET INCOME BEFORE CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF ACCOUNTING CHANGE

WOULD HAVE BEEN $681.4 MILLION AS A RESULT OF NOT RECORDING $8.6 MILLION IN GOODWILL AMORTIZATION AND $4.5 MILLION IN TRADEMARK AMORTIZATION. BASIC AND DILUTED EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE BEFORE ACCOUNTING CHANGE WOULD HAVE INCREASED $0.05 IN BOTH

THE COMPANY HAD NO

COMMERCIAL PAPER OUTSTANDING AT MAY 31, 2003. AT MAY 31, 2002, $338.3 MILLION WAS OUTSTANDING UNDER OUR COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAM.

THE COMPANY PURCHASES THROUGH NIAC CERTAIN ATHLETIC FOOTWEAR AND APPAREL IT ACQUIRES FROM NON-U.S. SUPPLIERS. THESE PURCHASES ARE FOR THE COMPANYS

OPERATIONS OUTSIDE OF THE U.S., EUROPE, AND JAPAN. ACCOUNTS PAYABLE TO NIAC ARE GENERALLY DUE UP TO 60 DAYS AFTER SHIPMENT OF GOODS FROM THE FOREIGN PORT. THE INTEREST RATE ON SUCH ACCOUNTS PAYABLE IS THE 60 DAY LONDON INTERBANK OFFERED RATE (LIBOR)

AS OF THE BEGINNING OF THE MONTH OF THE INVOICE DATE, PLUS 0.75%.

THE COMPANY HAS A $500.0 MILLION, 364-DAY COMMITTED CREDIT FACILITY AND A $500.0 MILLION, MULTI-YEAR COMMITTED CREDIT FACILITY IN PLACE WITH A GROUP OF BANKS UNDER WHICH NO AMOUNTS ARE OUTSTANDING. THE $500.0 MILLION, 364-DAY FACILITY

MATURES ON NOVEMBER 14, 2003 AND CAN BE EXTENDED 364 DAYS ON EACH MATURITY DATE. THE $500.0 MILLION MULTI-YEAR FACILITY MATURES ON NOVEMBER 17, 2005, AND ONCE A YEAR, IT CAN BE EXTENDED FOR ONE ADDITIONAL YEAR. BASED ON THE COMPANYS CURRENT

SENIOR UNSECURED DEBT RATINGS, THE INTEREST RATE CHARGED ON ANY OUTSTANDING BORROWINGS ON THE $500.0 MILLION 364-DAY FACILITY WOULD BE THE PREVAILING LIBOR PLUS 0.24%, AND THE INTEREST RATE CHARGED ON ANY OUTSTANDING BORROWINGS ON THE $500.0 MILLION

MULTI-YEAR FACILITY WOULD BE THE PREVAILING LIBOR PLUS 0.22%. THE FACILITY FEES FOR THE 364-DAY AND THE MULTI-YEAR FACILITIES ARE 0.06% AND 0.08%, RESPECTIVELY, OF THE TOTAL COMMITMENT. UNDER THESE AGREEMENTS, THE COMPANY MUST MAINTAIN, AMONG OTHER

IN AUGUST 2001, WE ISSUED A $250.0 MILLION CORPORATE BOND, MATURING IN AUGUST

2006, WITH AN INTEREST RATE OF 5.5%. WITH THE PROCEEDS, WE REDUCED THE AMOUNT OF COMMERCIAL PAPER OUTSTANDING. IN NOVEMBER 2001 THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO INTEREST RATE SWAP AGREEMENTS WITH THE SAME NOTIONAL AMOUNT AND MATURITY DATES AS THIS BOND,

WHEREBY THE COMPANY RECEIVES FIXED INTEREST PAYMENTS AT THE SAME RATE AS THE BOND AND PAYS VARIABLE INTEREST PAYMENTS BASED ON THE THREE-MONTH LIBOR PLUS A SPREAD. THE INTEREST RATES PAYABLE ON THESE SWAP AGREEMENTS WERE APPROXIMATELY 2.7% AND 3.3%

AT MAY 31, 2003 AND 2002, RESPECTIVELY.

WE HAVE AN EFFECTIVE

SHELF REGISTRATION STATEMENT WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION FOR $1 BILLION OF DEBT SECURITIES. DURING THE YEAR ENDED MAY 31, 2003, WE ISSUED A TOTAL OF $90.0 MILLION IN NOTES UNDER THE MEDIUM TERM NOTE PROGRAM OF THE SHELF

REGISTRATION. THE NOTES HAVE COUPON RATES THAT RANGE FROM 4.80% TO 5.66%. THE MATURITIES RANGE FROM JULY 9, 2007 TO AUGUST 7, 2012. FOR EACH OF THESE NOTES, WE HAVE ENTERED INTO INTEREST RATE SWAP AGREEMENTS WHEREBY WE RECEIVE FIXED INTEREST

PAYMENTS AT THE SAME RATE AS THE NOTES AND PAY VARIABLE INTEREST PAYMENTS BASED ON THE SIX-MONTH LIBOR PLUS A SPREAD. EACH SWAP HAS THE SAME NOTIONAL AMOUNT AND MATURITY DATE AS THE CORRESPONDING NOTE. AT MAY 31, 2003, THE INTEREST RATES PAYABLE ON

THESE SWAP AGREEMENTS RANGE FROM APPROXIMATELY 1.8% TO 2.1%. AFTER ISSUANCE OF THESE NOTES, $910.0 MILLION REMAINS AVAILABLE TO BE ISSUED UNDER OUR SHELF REGISTRATION.

IN JUNE 1996, ONE OF THE COMPANYS JAPANESE SUBSIDIARIES BORROWED 10,500 MILLION JAPANESE YEN IN A PRIVATE PLACEMENT

WITH A MATURITY OF JUNE 26, 2011. INTEREST IS PAID SEMI-ANNUALLY. THE AGREEMENT PROVIDES FOR EARLY RETIREMENT AFTER YEAR TEN.

IN JULY 1999, ANOTHER OF THE COMPANYS JAPANESE SUBSIDIARIES ASSUMED 13,000 MILLION IN JAPANESE YEN LOANS AS PART OF ITS AGREEMENT TO PURCHASE A

DISTRIBUTION CENTER IN JAPAN, WHICH SERVES AS COLLATERAL FOR THE LOANS. THESE LOANS MATURE IN EQUAL QUARTERLY INSTALLMENTS DURING THE PERIOD AUGUST 20, 2001 THROUGH NOVEMBER 20, 2020. INTEREST IS ALSO PAID QUARTERLY.

AMOUNTS OF LONG-TERM DEBT MATURITIES IN EACH OF THE YEARS ENDING MAY 31, 2004

CONSIDERATION WILL BE PAID FOR STOCK BONUSES AWARDED UNDER THE 1990 PLAN. A COMMITTEE OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS ADMINISTERS THE 1990 PLAN. THE COMMITTEE HAS THE AUTHORITY TO DETERMINE THE EMPLOYEES TO WHOM AWARDS WILL BE MADE, THE AMOUNT OF THE

AWARDS, AND THE OTHER TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THE AWARDS. AS OF MAY 31, 2003, THE COMMITTEE HAS GRANTED SUBSTANTIALLY ALL NON-STATUTORY STOCK OPTIONS AT 100% OF FAIR MARKET VALUE ON THE DATE OF GRANT UNDER THE 1990 PLAN.

FROM TIME TO TIME, THE COMPANY GRANTS RESTRICTED STOCK AND UNRESTRICTED STOCK

TO KEY EMPLOYEES UNDER THE 1990 PLAN. THE NUMBER OF SHARES GRANTED TO EMPLOYEES DURING THE YEARS ENDED MAY 31, 2003 AND MAY 31, 2002 WAS NOT MATERIAL. RECIPIENTS OF RESTRICTED SHARES ARE ENTITLED TO CASH DIVIDENDS AND TO VOTE THEIR RESPECTIVE SHARES

THROUGHOUT THE PERIOD OF RESTRICTION. THE VALUE OF ALL OF THE GRANTED SHARES WAS ESTABLISHED BY THE MARKET PRICE ON THE DATE OF GRANT. UNEARNED COMPENSATION WAS CHARGED FOR THE MARKET VALUE OF THE RESTRICTED SHARES. THE UNEARNED COMPENSATION IS

SHOWN AS A REDUCTION OF SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY AND IS BEING AMORTIZED RATABLY OVER THE VESTING PERIOD. DURING THE YEARS ENDED MAY 31, 2003, 2002, AND 2001, RESPECTIVELY, THE COMPANY RECOGNIZED $2.7 MILLION, $4.3 MILLION AND $4.3 MILLION

IN SELLING AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE RELATED TO THE GRANTS, NET OF FORFEITURES.

DURING THE YEARS ENDED MAY 31, 2003, 2002 AND 2001, THE COMPANY ALSO GRANTED SHARES OF RESTRICTED STOCK UNDER THE LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLAN (LTIP), ADOPTED BY THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND APPROVED BY

SHAREHOLDERS IN SEPTEMBER 1997. THE LTIP PROVIDES FOR THE ISSUANCE OF UP TO 1,000,000 SHARES OF CLASS B COMMON STOCK. UNDER THE LTIP, AWARDS ARE MADE TO CERTAIN EXECUTIVES IN THE FORM OF EITHER CASH OR STOCK BASED ON PERFORMANCE TARGETS ESTABLISHED

OVER VARYING TIME PERIODS. ONCE PERFORMANCE TARGETS ARE ACHIEVED, CASH OR SHARES OF STOCK ARE ISSUED. FOR CERTAIN PLAN YEARS, SHARES OF STOCK ISSUED REMAIN RESTRICTED FOR AN ADDITIONAL THREE YEARS. IN OTHER PLAN YEARS, SHARES ARE IMMEDIATELY VESTED

UPON GRANT. UNVESTED SHARES ARE SUBJECT TO FORFEITURE IF THE EXECUTIVES EMPLOYMENT TERMINATES WITHIN THAT PERIOD. PLAN PARTICIPANTS ARE ENTITLED TO CASH DIVIDENDS AND TO VOTE THEIR RESPECTIVE SHARES. THE VALUE OF THE RESTRICTED SHARES IS

ESTABLISHED BY THE MARKET PRICE ON THE DATE OF ISSUANCE. UNEARNED COMPENSATION IS CHARGED FOR THE MARKET VALUE OF THE RESTRICTED SHARES. THE UNEARNED COMPENSATION IS SHOWN AS A REDUCTION OF SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY AND IS BEING AMORTIZED RATABLY

OVER THE SERVICE AND VESTING PERIODS. UNDER THE LTIP NO SHARES WERE ISSUED DURING THE YEAR ENDED MAY 31, 2003 AS PERFORMANCE TARGETS FOR THE PLAN YEAR ENDED MAY 31, 2002 WERE NOT MET. A TOTAL OF 38,000 RESTRICTED SHARES WITH AN AVERAGE PRICE OF

$49.50 WERE ISSUED DURING THE YEAR ENDED MAY 31, 2002 FOR THE PLAN YEAR ENDED MAY 31, 2002, AND 115,000 RESTRICTED SHARES WITH AN AVERAGE MARKET VALUE OF $47.56 WERE ISSUED DURING THE YEAR ENDED MAY 31, 2001. RELATED TO THE LTIP, THE COMPANY

RECOGNIZED $9.9 MILLION, $9.0 MILLION AND $2.3 MILLION OF SELLING AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE IN THE YEARS ENDING MAY 31, 2003, 2002 AND 2001, RESPECTIVELY, NET OF FORFEITURES.

IN SEPTEMBER 2001, THE

COMPANYS SHAREHOLDERS APPROVED THE ESTABLISHMENT OF AN EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN (THE ESPP) UNDER WHICH 3,000,000 SHARES OF CLASS B STOCK ARE RESERVED FOR ISSUANCE TO EMPLOYEES. THE PLAN QUALIFIES AS A NONCOMPENSATORY EMPLOYEE

STOCK PURCHASE PLAN UNDER SECTION 423 OF THE INTERNAL REVENUE CODE. EMPLOYEES ARE ELIGIBLE TO PARTICIPATE THROUGH PAYROLL DEDUCTIONS IN AMOUNTS RANGING FROM 1% TO 10% OF THEIR COMPENSATION NOT TO EXCEED LIMITATIONS SET OUT UNDER SECTION 423. AT THE

END OF EACH SIX-MONTH OFFERING PERIOD, SHARES ARE PURCHASED BY THE PARTICIPANTS AT 85% OF THE LOWER OF THE FAIR MARKET VALUE AT THE BEGINNING OR THE END OF THE OFFERING PERIOD. UNDER THE ESPP, 249,000 SHARES WERE ISSUED DURING THE YEAR ENDED MAY 31,

2003 AND 78,000 SHARES WERE ISSUED DURING THE YEAR ENDED MAY 31, 2002.

AMOUNTS OF MINIMUM FUTURE ANNUAL RENTAL COMMITMENTS UNDER NON-CANCELABLE OPERATING LEASES IN EACH OF THE FIVE YEARS ENDING MAY 31, 2004 THROUGH 2008 ARE $188.9 MILLION, $149.6 MILLION, $129.5 MILLION, $111.1 MILLION, $92.2 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, AND

$505.6 MILLION IN LATER YEARS.

AS OF MAY 31, 2003 AND 2002,

THE COMPANY HAD LETTERS OF CREDIT OUTSTANDING TOTALING $704.4 MILLION AND $808.4 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. THESE LETTERS OF CREDIT WERE ISSUED PRIMARILY FOR THE PURCHASE OF INVENTORY.

IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF ITS BUSINESS, THE COMPANY IS INVOLVED IN LEGAL PROCEEDINGS INVOLVING CONTRACTUAL AND EMPLOYMENT

RELATIONSHIPS, PRODUCT LIABILITY CLAIMS, TRADEMARK RIGHTS, AND A VARIETY OF OTHER MATTERS. THE

55

TABLE OF CONTENTS

NIKE, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (CONTINUED)

COMPANY DOES NOT BELIEVE THERE ARE ANY PENDING LEGAL PROCEEDINGS THAT WILL HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL POSITION OR RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS.

NOTE 16  RISK MANAGEMENT AND DERIVATIVES

THE COMPANY IS EXPOSED TO GLOBAL MARKET RISKS, INCLUDING THE EFFECT OF

CHANGES IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES AND INTEREST RATES. THE COMPANY USES DERIVATIVES TO MANAGE FINANCIAL EXPOSURES THAT OCCUR IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS. THE COMPANY DOES NOT HOLD OR ISSUE DERIVATIVES FOR TRADING PURPOSES.

THE COMPANY FORMALLY DOCUMENTS ALL RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN HEDGING

INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGED ITEMS, AS WELL AS ITS RISK-MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVE AND STRATEGY FOR UNDERTAKING HEDGE TRANSACTIONS. THIS PROCESS INCLUDES LINKING ALL DERIVATIVES TO EITHER SPECIFIC ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ON THE BALANCE SHEET OR SPECIFIC FIRM

COMMITMENTS OR FORECASTED TRANSACTIONS.

SUBSTANTIALLY ALL

DERIVATIVES ENTERED INTO BY THE COMPANY ARE DESIGNATED AS EITHER CASH FLOW OR FAIR VALUE HEDGES. ALL DERIVATIVES ARE RECOGNIZED ON THE BALANCE SHEET AT THEIR FAIR VALUE. UNREALIZED GAIN POSITIONS ARE RECORDED AS OTHER CURRENT ASSETS OR OTHER

NON-CURRENT ASSETS, DEPENDING ON THE INSTRUMENTS MATURITY DATE. UNREALIZED LOSS POSITIONS ARE RECORDED AS ACCRUED LIABILITIES OR OTHER NON-CURRENT LIABILITIES. CHANGES IN FAIR VALUES OF OUTSTANDING CASH FLOW HEDGE DERIVATIVES THAT ARE HIGHLY

EFFECTIVE ARE RECORDED IN OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME, UNTIL NET INCOME IS AFFECTED BY THE VARIABILITY OF CASH FLOWS OF THE HEDGED TRANSACTION. FAIR VALUE HEDGES ARE RECORDED IN NET INCOME AND ARE OFFSET BY THE CHANGE IN FAIR VALUE OF THE UNDERLYING

ASSET OR LIABILITY BEING HEDGED.

CASH FLOW HEDGES

THE PURPOSE OF THE COMPANYS FOREIGN CURRENCY

HEDGING ACTIVITIES IS TO PROTECT THE COMPANY FROM THE RISK THAT THE EVENTUAL CASH FLOWS RESULTING FROM TRANSACTIONS IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES, INCLUDING REVENUES, PRODUCT COSTS, SELLING AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES, AND INTERCOMPANY TRANSACTIONS,

INCLUDING INTERCOMPANY BORROWINGS, WILL BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY CHANGES IN EXCHANGE RATES. IT IS THE COMPANYS POLICY TO UTILIZE DERIVATIVES TO REDUCE FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISKS WHERE INTERNAL NETTING STRATEGIES CANNOT BE EFFECTIVELY EMPLOYED.

DERIVATIVES USED BY THE COMPANY TO HEDGE FOREIGN CURRENCY

EXCHANGE RISKS ARE FORWARD EXCHANGE CONTRACTS, OPTIONS AND CROSS-CURRENCY SWAPS. THESE INSTRUMENTS PROTECT AGAINST THE RISK THAT THE EVENTUAL NET CASH INFLOWS AND OUTFLOWS FROM FOREIGN CURRENCY DENOMINATED TRANSACTIONS WILL BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY

CHANGES IN EXCHANGE RATES. THE CROSS-CURRENCY SWAPS ARE USED TO HEDGE FOREIGN CURRENCY DENOMINATED PAYMENTS RELATED TO INTERCOMPANY LOAN AGREEMENTS. HEDGED TRANSACTIONS ARE DENOMINATED PRIMARILY IN EUROPEAN CURRENCIES, JAPANESE YEN, CANADIAN

DOLLARS, KOREAN WON, MEXICAN PESOS, AND AUSTRALIAN DOLLARS. THE COMPANY HEDGES UP TO 100% OF ANTICIPATED EXPOSURES TYPICALLY TWELVE MONTHS IN ADVANCE BUT HAS HEDGED AS MUCH AS 32 MONTHS IN ADVANCE. WHEN INTERCOMPANY LOANS ARE HEDGED, IT IS TYPICALLY

FOR THEIR EXPECTED DURATION.

SUBSTANTIALLY ALL FOREIGN

CURRENCY DERIVATIVES ENTERED INTO BY THE COMPANY QUALIFY FOR AND ARE DESIGNATED AS FOREIGN-CURRENCY CASH FLOW HEDGES, INCLUDING THOSE HEDGING FOREIGN CURRENCY DENOMINATED FIRM COMMITMENTS.

CHANGES IN FAIR VALUES OF OUTSTANDING CASH FLOW HEDGE DERIVATIVES THAT ARE

HIGHLY EFFECTIVE ARE RECORDED IN OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME, UNTIL NET INCOME IS AFFECTED BY THE VARIABILITY OF CASH FLOWS OF THE HEDGED TRANSACTION. IN MOST CASES AMOUNTS RECORDED IN OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME WILL BE RELEASED TO NET INCOME SOME

TIME AFTER THE MATURITY OF THE RELATED DERIVATIVE. THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF INCOME CLASSIFICATION OF EFFECTIVE HEDGE RESULTS IS THE SAME AS THAT OF THE UNDERLYING EXPOSURE. RESULTS OF HEDGES OF REVENUE AND PRODUCT COSTS ARE RECORDED IN REVENUE

AND COST OF SALES, RESPECTIVELY, WHEN THE UNDERLYING HEDGED TRANSACTION AFFECTS NET INCOME.

56

TABLE OF CONTENTS

NIKE, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (CONTINUED)

RESULTS OF HEDGES OF SELLING AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE ARE RECORDED TOGETHER WITH THOSE COSTS WHEN THE RELATED EXPENSE IS RECORDED. RESULTS OF HEDGES OF

ANTICIPATED INTERCOMPANY TRANSACTIONS ARE RECORDED IN OTHER INCOME/EXPENSE WHEN THE TRANSACTION OCCURS. HEDGES OF RECORDED BALANCE SHEET POSITIONS ARE RECORDED IN OTHER INCOME/EXPENSE CURRENTLY TOGETHER WITH THE TRANSACTION GAIN OR LOSS FROM THE

HEDGED BALANCE SHEET POSITION. NET FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSACTION GAINS AND LOSSES, WHICH INCLUDES HEDGE RESULTS CAPTURED IN REVENUES, COST OF SALES, SELLING AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE AND OTHER INCOME/EXPENSE, WERE A $180.9 MILLION LOSS, A $42.7

MILLION GAIN, AND A $129.6 MILLION GAIN FOR THE YEARS ENDED MAY 31, 2003, 2002, AND 2001, RESPECTIVELY.

PREMIUMS PAID ON OPTIONS ARE INITIALLY RECORDED AS DEFERRED CHARGES. THE COMPANY ASSESSES EFFECTIVENESS ON OPTIONS BASED ON THE TOTAL CASH FLOWS METHOD

AND RECORDS TOTAL CHANGES IN THE OPTIONS FAIR VALUE TO OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME TO THE DEGREE THEY ARE EFFECTIVE.

AS OF MAY 31, 2003, $171.9 MILLION OF DEFERRED NET LOSSES (NET OF TAX) ON BOTH OUTSTANDING AND MATURED DERIVATIVES ACCUMULATED IN OTHER COMPREHENSIVE

INCOME ARE EXPECTED TO BE RECLASSIFIED TO NET INCOME DURING THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS AS A RESULT OF UNDERLYING HEDGED TRANSACTIONS ALSO BEING RECORDED IN NET INCOME. ACTUAL AMOUNTS ULTIMATELY RECLASSIFIED TO NET INCOME ARE DEPENDENT ON THE EXCHANGE

RATES IN EFFECT WHEN DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS THAT ARE CURRENTLY OUTSTANDING MATURE. AS OF MAY 31, 2003, THE MAXIMUM TERM OVER WHICH THE COMPANY IS HEDGING EXPOSURES TO THE VARIABILITY OF CASH FLOWS FOR ALL FORECASTED AND RECORDED TRANSACTIONS IS

18 MONTHS.

THE COMPANY FORMALLY ASSESSES, BOTH AT THE

HEDGES INCEPTION AND ON AN ONGOING BASIS, WHETHER THE DERIVATIVES THAT ARE USED IN HEDGING TRANSACTIONS HAVE BEEN HIGHLY EFFECTIVE IN OFFSETTING CHANGES IN THE CASH FLOWS OF HEDGED ITEMS AND WHETHER THOSE DERIVATIVES MAY BE EXPECTED TO REMAIN

HIGHLY EFFECTIVE IN FUTURE PERIODS. WHEN IT IS DETERMINED THAT A DERIVATIVE IS NOT, OR HAS CEASED TO BE, HIGHLY EFFECTIVE AS A HEDGE, THE COMPANY DISCONTINUES HEDGE ACCOUNTING PROSPECTIVELY.

THE COMPANY DISCONTINUES HEDGE ACCOUNTING PROSPECTIVELY WHEN (1) IT

DETERMINES THAT THE DERIVATIVE IS NO LONGER HIGHLY EFFECTIVE IN OFFSETTING CHANGES IN THE CASH FLOWS OF A HEDGED ITEM (INCLUDING HEDGED ITEMS SUCH AS FIRM COMMITMENTS OR FORECASTED TRANSACTIONS); (2) THE DERIVATIVE EXPIRES OR IS SOLD, TERMINATED, OR

EXERCISED; (3) IT IS NO LONGER PROBABLE THAT THE FORECASTED TRANSACTION WILL OCCUR; OR (4) MANAGEMENT DETERMINES THAT DESIGNATING THE DERIVATIVE AS A HEDGING INSTRUMENT IS NO LONGER APPROPRIATE.

WHEN THE COMPANY DISCONTINUES HEDGE ACCOUNTING BECAUSE IT IS NO LONGER

PROBABLE THAT THE FORECASTED TRANSACTION WILL OCCUR IN THE ORIGINALLY EXPECTED PERIOD, THE GAIN OR LOSS ON THE DERIVATIVE REMAINS IN ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME AND IS RECLASSIFIED TO NET INCOME WHEN THE FORECASTED TRANSACTION AFFECTS NET

INCOME. HOWEVER, IF IT IS PROBABLE THAT A FORECASTED TRANSACTION WILL NOT OCCUR BY THE END OF THE ORIGINALLY SPECIFIED TIME PERIOD OR WITHIN AN ADDITIONAL TWO-MONTH PERIOD OF TIME THEREAFTER, THE GAINS AND LOSSES THAT WERE ACCUMULATED IN OTHER

COMPREHENSIVE LOSS WILL BE RECOGNIZED IMMEDIATELY IN NET INCOME. IN ALL SITUATIONS IN WHICH HEDGE ACCOUNTING IS DISCONTINUED AND THE DERIVATIVE REMAINS OUTSTANDING, THE COMPANY WILL CARRY THE DERIVATIVE AT ITS FAIR VALUE ON THE BALANCE SHEET,

RECOGNIZING FUTURE CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE IN CURRENT-PERIOD NET INCOME. ANY HEDGE INEFFECTIVENESS IS RECORDED IN CURRENT-PERIOD NET INCOME. EFFECTIVENESS FOR CASH FLOW HEDGES IS ASSESSED BASED ON FORWARD RATES.

FOR THE YEAR ENDED MAY 31, 2003 THE COMPANY RECORDED IN OTHER INCOME/EXPENSE

AN INSIGNIFICANT LOSS REPRESENTING THE TOTAL INEFFECTIVENESS OF ALL DERIVATIVES. AN INSIGNIFICANT GAIN WAS RECORDED IN OTHER INCOME/EXPENSE FOR THE YEAR ENDED MAY 31, 2002. NET INCOME FOR EACH OF THE YEARS ENDED MAY 31, 2003 AND 2002 WAS NOT

MATERIALLY AFFECTED DUE TO DISCONTINUED HEDGE ACCOUNTING.

FAIR VALUE HEDGES

THE COMPANY IS ALSO EXPOSED TO THE RISK OF CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF CERTAIN FIXED-RATE DEBT ATTRIBUTABLE TO CHANGES IN

INTEREST RATES. DERIVATIVES CURRENTLY USED BY THE COMPANY TO HEDGE THIS RISK ARE RECEIVE-FIXED, PAY-VARIABLE INTEREST RATE SWAPS.

SUBSTANTIALLY ALL INTEREST RATE SWAP AGREEMENTS ARE DESIGNATED AS FAIR VALUE HEDGES OF THE RELATED LONG-TERM DEBT AND MEET THE SHORTCUT METHOD

REQUIREMENTS UNDER FAS 133. ACCORDINGLY, CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUES OF THE INTEREST RATE SWAP AGREEMENTS ARE EXACTLY OFFSET BY CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE UNDERLYING LONG-TERM DEBT. NO INEFFECTIVENESS HAS BEEN RECORDED TO NET INCOME RELATED TO

INTEREST RATE SWAPS DESIGNATED AS FAIR VALUE HEDGES FOR THE YEARS ENDED MAY 31, 2003 AND 2002.

DURING THE YEAR ENDED MAY 31, 2003 WE ALSO ENTERED INTO AN INTEREST RATE SWAP AGREEMENT RELATED TO A JAPANESE YEN DENOMINATED INTERCOMPANY LOAN WITH ONE OF OUR JAPANESE SUBSIDIARIES. THE JAPANESE SUBSIDIARY PAYS

VARIABLE INTEREST ON THE INTERCOMPANY LOAN BASED ON 3-MONTH LIBOR PLUS A SPREAD. UNDER THE INTEREST RATE SWAP AGREEMENT, THE SUBSIDIARY PAYS FIXED INTEREST PAYMENTS AT 0.8% AND RECEIVES VARIABLE INTEREST PAYMENTS BASED ON 3-MONTH LIBOR PLUS A SPREAD

BASED ON A NOTIONAL AMOUNT OF 8 BILLION JAPANESE YEN. THIS INTEREST RATE SWAP IS NOT ACCOUNTED FOR AS A HEDGE, ACCORDINGLY CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE SWAP ARE RECORDED TO NET INCOME.

AS OF MAY 31, 2003, THE RECORDED FAIR VALUE OF THE

SWAP WAS A $1.0 MILLION LOSS.

CONCENTRATION OF

CREDIT RISK

THE COMPANY IS EXPOSED TO CREDIT-RELATED

LOSSES IN THE EVENT OF NON-PERFORMANCE BY COUNTERPARTIES TO HEDGING INSTRUMENTS. THE COUNTERPARTIES TO ALL DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS ARE MAJOR FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS WITH INVESTMENT GRADE CREDIT RATINGS. HOWEVER, THIS DOES NOT ELIMINATE THE

COMPANYS EXPOSURE TO CREDIT RISK WITH THESE INSTITUTIONS. THIS CREDIT RISK IS GENERALLY LIMITED TO THE UNREALIZED GAINS IN SUCH CONTRACTS SHOULD ANY OF THESE COUNTERPARTIES FAIL TO PERFORM AS CONTRACTED. TO MANAGE THIS RISK, THE COMPANY HAS

ESTABLISHED STRICT COUNTERPARTY CREDIT GUIDELINES WHICH ARE CONTINUALLY MONITORED AND REPORTED TO SENIOR MANAGEMENT ACCORDING TO PRESCRIBED GUIDELINES. THE COMPANY UTILIZES A PORTFOLIO OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS EITHER HEADQUARTERED OR OPERATING IN

THE SAME COUNTRIES THE COMPANY CONDUCTS ITS BUSINESS. AS A RESULT OF THE ABOVE CONSIDERATIONS, THE COMPANY CONSIDERS THE RISK OF COUNTERPARTY DEFAULT TO BE MINIMAL.

IN ADDITION TO HEDGING INSTRUMENTS, THE COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK ASSOCIATED WITH CASH AND

EQUIVALENTS AND ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE. THE COMPANY PLACES CASH AND EQUIVALENTS WITH FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS WITH INVESTMENT GRADE CREDIT RATINGS AND, BY POLICY, LIMITS THE AMOUNT OF CREDIT EXPOSURE TO ANY ONE FINANCIAL INSTITUTION. THE COMPANY

CONSIDERS ITS CONCENTRATION RISK RELATED TO ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE TO BE MITIGATED BY THE COMPANYS CREDIT POLICY, THE SIGNIFICANCE OF OUTSTANDING BALANCES OWED BY EACH INDIVIDUAL CUSTOMER AT ANY POINT IN TIME AND THE GEOGRAPHIC DISPERSION OF

THESE CUSTOMERS.

OPERATING SEGMENTS.

THE COMPANYS

OPERATING SEGMENTS ARE EVIDENCE OF THE STRUCTURE OF THE COMPANYS INTERNAL ORGANIZATION. THE MAJOR SEGMENTS ARE DEFINED BY GEOGRAPHIC REGIONS WITH OPERATIONS PARTICIPATING IN NIKE BRAND SALES ACTIVITY. EACH NIKE BRAND GEOGRAPHIC SEGMENT

OPERATES PREDOMINANTLY IN ONE INDUSTRY: THE DESIGN, PRODUCTION, MARKETING AND SELLING OF SPORTS AND FITNESS FOOTWEAR, APPAREL, AND EQUIPMENT. THE OTHER CATEGORY SHOWN BELOW REPRESENTS ACTIVITIES OF COLE HAAN HOLDINGS, INC., BAUER NIKE

HOCKEY, INC., HURLEY INTERNATIONAL LLC, NIKE GOLF, AND NIKE IHM, INC., WHICH ARE CONSIDERED IMMATERIAL FOR INDIVIDUAL DISCLOSURE.

IN PRIOR YEARS, OPERATING ACTIVITY FOR NIKE GOLF WAS CLASSIFIED WITHIN EACH REGION. EFFECTIVE JUNE 1, 2002, NIKE GOLF REVENUES AND INCOME FROM THE

COMPANYS LARGEST GOLF MARKETS HAVE BEEN RECLASSIFIED TO THE OTHER CATEGORY, AS A RESULT THAT THE COMPANY HAS BEGUN MANAGING THESE OPERATIONS SEPARATELY FROM THE REGIONAL BUSINESSES. CERTAIN NIKE GOLF INVENTORIES, RECEIVABLES, AND PROPERTY,

PLANT, AND EQUIPMENT CONTINUE TO BE MANAGED BY THE REGIONS, AND AS A RESULT, NO RECLASSIFICATIONS FOR THESE BALANCES HAVE BEEN MADE. NIKE GOLF INFORMATION FOR THE YEARS ENDED MAY 31, 2002 AND 2001 HAVE BEEN RECLASSIFIED TO CONFORM TO THE CURRENT

YEAR PRESENTATION.

WHERE APPLICABLE, CORPORATE

REPRESENTS ITEMS NECESSARY TO RECONCILE TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, WHICH GENERALLY INCLUDE CORPORATE ACTIVITY AND CORPORATE ELIMINATIONS. CERTAIN MISCELLANEOUS OPERATING ACTIVITIES HAVE BEEN RECLASSIFIED BETWEEN CORPORATE AND THE

APPLICABLE REGIONAL OPERATING SEGMENT AS OF JUNE 1, 2002, REFLECTING A CHANGE IN THE MANAGEMENT OF THESE ACTIVITIES. WITH RESPECT TO THESE CLASSIFICATIONS, THE APPLICABLE PRIOR YEAR PERIODS HAVE BEEN RECLASSIFIED TO CONFORM TO THE CURRENT YEAR

PRESENTATION.

NET REVENUES AS SHOWN BELOW REPRESENT SALES TO

EXTERNAL CUSTOMERS FOR EACH SEGMENT. INTERCOMPANY REVENUES HAVE BEEN ELIMINATED AND ARE IMMATERIAL FOR SEPARATE DISCLOSURE. THE COMPANY EVALUATES PERFORMANCE OF INDIVIDUAL OPERATING SEGMENTS BASED ON PRE-TAX INCOME. ON A CONSOLIDATED BASIS, THIS

AMOUNT REPRESENTS INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES AND CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF ACCOUNTING CHANGE AS SHOWN IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME. RECONCILING ITEMS FOR PRE-TAX INCOME REPRESENT CORPORATE COSTS THAT ARE NOT ALLOCATED TO THE OPERATING

SEGMENTS FOR MANAGEMENT REPORTING INCLUDING CERTAIN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE GAINS AND LOSSES ON TRANSACTIONS, AMORTIZATION OF INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND GOODWILL, AND INTERCOMPANY ELIMINATIONS FOR SPECIFIC INCOME STATEMENT ITEMS IN THE

CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME.

ADDITIONS TO LONG-LIVED

ASSETS AS PRESENTED FOLLOWING REPRESENT CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND ADDITIONS TO IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLES AND GOODWILL. GENERALLY, ADDITIONS TO IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND GOODWILL ARE CONSIDERED CORPORATE COSTS AND ARE NOT ATTRIBUTABLE TO ANY

SPECIFIC OPERATING SEGMENT. SEE NOTE 4 FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION ON IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND GOODWILL. ADDITIONS TO OTHER LONG-LIVED ASSETS ARE NOT SIGNIFICANT AND ARE COMPRISED OF ADDITIONS TO MISCELLANEOUS CORPORATE ASSETS NOT ATTRIBUTABLE
